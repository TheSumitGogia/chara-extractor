CHAPTER
I
--
START
IN
LIFE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
born
in
the
year
1632
,
in
the
city
of
York
,
of
a
good
family
,
*NL*
though
not
of
that
country
,
my
father
being
a
foreigner
of
Bremen
,
who
*NL*
settled
first
at
Hull
.
He
got
a
good
estate
by
merchandise
,
and
leaving
*NL*
off
his
trade
,
lived
afterwards
at
York
,
from
whence
he
had
married
my
*NL*
mother
,
whose
relations
were
named
Robinson
,
a
very
good
family
in
that
*NL*
country
,
and
from
whom
I
was
called
Robinson
Kreutznaer
;
but
,
by
the
*NL*
usual
corruption
of
words
in
England
,
we
are
now
called
--
nay
we
call
*NL*
ourselves
and
write
our
name
--
Crusoe
;
and
so
my
companions
always
called
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
two
elder
brothers
,
one
of
whom
was
lieutenant-colonel
to
an
*NL*
English
regiment
of
foot
in
Flanders
,
formerly
commanded
by
the
famous
*NL*
Colonel
Lockhart
,
and
was
killed
at
the
battle
near
Dunkirk
against
the
*NL*
Spaniards
.
What
became
of
my
second
brother
I
never
knew
,
any
more
than
*NL*
my
father
or
mother
knew
what
became
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
the
third
son
of
the
family
and
not
bred
to
any
trade
,
my
head
*NL*
began
to
be
filled
very
early
with
rambling
thoughts
.
My
father
,
who
was
*NL*
very
ancient
,
had
given
me
a
competent
share
of
learning
,
as
far
as
*NL*
house-education
and
a
country
free
school
generally
go
,
and
designed
me
*NL*
for
the
law
;
but
I
would
be
satisfied
with
nothing
but
going
to
sea
;
and
*NL*
my
inclination
to
this
led
me
so
strongly
against
the
will
,
nay
,
the
*NL*
commands
of
my
father
,
and
against
all
the
entreaties
and
persuasions
of
*NL*
my
mother
and
other
friends
,
that
there
seemed
to
be
something
fatal
in
*NL*
that
propensity
of
nature
,
tending
directly
to
the
life
of
misery
which
*NL*
was
to
befall
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
a
wise
and
grave
man
,
gave
me
serious
and
excellent
counsel
*NL*
against
what
he
foresaw
was
my
design
.
He
called
me
one
morning
into
his
*NL*
chamber
,
where
he
was
confined
by
the
gout
,
and
expostulated
very
warmly
*NL*
with
me
upon
this
subject
.
He
asked
me
what
reasons
,
more
than
a
mere
*NL*
wandering
inclination
,
I
had
for
leaving
father
's
house
and
my
native
*NL*
country
,
where
I
might
be
well
introduced
,
and
had
a
prospect
of
raising
*NL*
my
fortune
by
application
and
industry
,
with
a
life
of
ease
and
pleasure
.
*NL*
He
told
me
it
was
men
of
desperate
fortunes
on
one
hand
,
or
of
aspiring
,
*NL*
superior
fortunes
on
the
other
,
who
went
abroad
upon
adventures
,
to
rise
*NL*
by
enterprise
,
and
make
themselves
famous
in
undertakings
of
a
nature
out
*NL*
of
the
common
road
;
that
these
things
were
all
either
too
far
above
me
or
*NL*
too
far
below
me
;
that
mine
was
the
middle
state
,
or
what
might
be
called
*NL*
the
upper
station
of
low
life
,
which
he
had
found
,
by
long
experience
,
*NL*
was
the
best
state
in
the
world
,
the
most
suited
to
human
happiness
,
not
*NL*
exposed
to
the
miseries
and
hardships
,
the
labour
and
sufferings
of
the
*NL*
mechanic
part
of
mankind
,
and
not
embarrassed
with
the
pride
,
luxury
,
*NL*
ambition
,
and
envy
of
the
upper
part
of
mankind
.
He
told
me
I
might
*NL*
judge
of
the
happiness
of
this
state
by
this
one
thing
--
viz
.
that
this
*NL*
was
the
state
of
life
which
all
other
people
envied
;
that
kings
have
*NL*
frequently
lamented
the
miserable
consequence
of
being
born
to
great
*NL*
things
,
and
wished
they
had
been
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
two
*NL*
extremes
,
between
the
mean
and
the
great
;
that
the
wise
man
gave
his
*NL*
testimony
to
this
,
as
the
standard
of
felicity
,
when
he
prayed
to
have
*NL*
neither
poverty
nor
riches
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bade
me
observe
it
,
and
I
should
always
find
that
the
calamities
of
*NL*
life
were
shared
among
the
upper
and
lower
part
of
mankind
,
but
that
the
*NL*
middle
station
had
the
fewest
disasters
,
and
was
not
exposed
to
so
many
*NL*
vicissitudes
as
the
higher
or
lower
part
of
mankind
;
nay
,
they
were
not
*NL*
subjected
to
so
many
distempers
and
uneasinesses
,
either
of
body
or
mind
,
*NL*
as
those
were
who
,
by
vicious
living
,
luxury
,
and
extravagances
on
the
*NL*
one
hand
,
or
by
hard
labour
,
want
of
necessaries
,
and
mean
or
*NL*
insufficient
diet
on
the
other
hand
,
bring
distemper
upon
themselves
by
*NL*
the
natural
consequences
of
their
way
of
living
;
that
the
middle
station
*NL*
of
life
was
calculated
for
all
kind
of
virtue
and
all
kind
of
enjoyments
;
*NL*
that
peace
and
plenty
were
the
handmaids
of
a
middle
fortune
;
that
*NL*
temperance
,
moderation
,
quietness
,
health
,
society
,
all
agreeable
*NL*
diversions
,
and
all
desirable
pleasures
,
were
the
blessings
attending
the
*NL*
middle
station
of
life
;
that
this
way
men
went
silently
and
smoothly
*NL*
through
the
world
,
and
comfortably
out
of
it
,
not
embarrassed
with
the
*NL*
labours
of
the
hands
or
of
the
head
,
not
sold
to
a
life
of
slavery
for
*NL*
daily
bread
,
nor
harassed
with
perplexed
circumstances
,
which
rob
the
*NL*
soul
of
peace
and
the
body
of
rest
,
nor
enraged
with
the
passion
of
envy
,
*NL*
or
the
secret
burning
lust
of
ambition
for
great
things
;
but
,
in
easy
*NL*
circumstances
,
sliding
gently
through
the
world
,
and
sensibly
tasting
the
*NL*
sweets
of
living
,
without
the
bitter
;
feeling
that
they
are
happy
,
and
*NL*
learning
by
every
day
's
experience
to
know
it
more
sensibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
he
pressed
me
earnestly
,
and
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
,
*NL*
not
to
play
the
young
man
,
nor
to
precipitate
myself
into
miseries
which
*NL*
nature
,
and
the
station
of
life
I
was
born
in
,
seemed
to
have
provided
*NL*
against
;
that
I
was
under
no
necessity
of
seeking
my
bread
;
that
he
would
*NL*
do
well
for
me
,
and
endeavour
to
enter
me
fairly
into
the
station
of
life
*NL*
which
he
had
just
been
recommending
to
me
;
and
that
if
I
was
not
very
*NL*
easy
and
happy
in
the
world
,
it
must
be
my
mere
fate
or
fault
that
must
*NL*
hinder
it
;
and
that
he
should
have
nothing
to
answer
for
,
having
thus
*NL*
discharged
his
duty
in
warning
me
against
measures
which
he
knew
would
be
*NL*
to
my
hurt
;
in
a
word
,
that
as
he
would
do
very
kind
things
for
me
if
I
*NL*
would
stay
and
settle
at
home
as
he
directed
,
so
he
would
not
have
so
*NL*
much
hand
in
my
misfortunes
as
to
give
me
any
encouragement
to
go
away
;
*NL*
and
to
close
all
,
he
told
me
I
had
my
elder
brother
for
an
example
,
to
*NL*
whom
he
had
used
the
same
earnest
persuasions
to
keep
him
from
going
into
*NL*
the
Low
Country
wars
,
but
could
not
prevail
,
his
young
desires
prompting
*NL*
him
to
run
into
the
army
,
where
he
was
killed
;
and
though
he
said
he
*NL*
would
not
cease
to
pray
for
me
,
yet
he
would
venture
to
say
to
me
,
that
*NL*
if
I
did
take
this
foolish
step
,
God
would
not
bless
me
,
and
I
should
*NL*
have
leisure
hereafter
to
reflect
upon
having
neglected
his
counsel
when
*NL*
there
might
be
none
to
assist
in
my
recovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
observed
in
this
last
part
of
his
discourse
,
which
was
truly
prophetic
,
*NL*
though
I
suppose
my
father
did
not
know
it
to
be
so
himself
--
I
say
,
I
*NL*
observed
the
tears
run
down
his
face
very
plentifully
,
especially
when
he
*NL*
spoke
of
my
brother
who
was
killed
:
and
that
when
he
spoke
of
my
having
*NL*
leisure
to
repent
,
and
none
to
assist
me
,
he
was
so
moved
that
he
broke
*NL*
off
the
discourse
,
and
told
me
his
heart
was
so
full
he
could
say
no
more
*NL*
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sincerely
affected
with
this
discourse
,
and
,
indeed
,
who
could
be
*NL*
otherwise
?
and
I
resolved
not
to
think
of
going
abroad
any
more
,
but
to
*NL*
settle
at
home
according
to
my
father
's
desire
.
But
alas
!
a
few
days
*NL*
wore
it
all
off
;
and
,
in
short
,
to
prevent
any
of
my
father
's
further
*NL*
importunities
,
in
a
few
weeks
after
I
resolved
to
run
quite
away
from
*NL*
him
.
However
,
I
did
not
act
quite
so
hastily
as
the
first
heat
of
my
*NL*
resolution
prompted
;
but
I
took
my
mother
at
a
time
when
I
thought
her
a
*NL*
little
more
pleasant
than
ordinary
,
and
told
her
that
my
thoughts
were
so
*NL*
entirely
bent
upon
seeing
the
world
that
I
should
never
settle
to
*NL*
anything
with
resolution
enough
to
go
through
with
it
,
and
my
father
had
*NL*
better
give
me
his
consent
than
force
me
to
go
without
it
;
that
I
was
now
*NL*
eighteen
years
old
,
which
was
too
late
to
go
apprentice
to
a
trade
or
*NL*
clerk
to
an
attorney
;
that
I
was
sure
if
I
did
I
should
never
serve
out
*NL*
my
time
,
but
I
should
certainly
run
away
from
my
master
before
my
time
*NL*
was
out
,
and
go
to
sea
;
and
if
she
would
speak
to
my
father
to
let
me
go
*NL*
one
voyage
abroad
,
if
I
came
home
again
,
and
did
not
like
it
,
I
would
go
*NL*
no
more
;
and
I
would
promise
,
by
a
double
diligence
,
to
recover
the
time
*NL*
that
I
had
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
put
my
mother
into
a
great
passion
;
she
told
me
she
knew
it
would
be
*NL*
to
no
purpose
to
speak
to
my
father
upon
any
such
subject
;
that
he
knew
*NL*
too
well
what
was
my
interest
to
give
his
consent
to
anything
so
much
for
*NL*
my
hurt
;
and
that
she
wondered
how
I
could
think
of
any
such
thing
after
*NL*
the
discourse
I
had
had
with
my
father
,
and
such
kind
and
tender
*NL*
expressions
as
she
knew
my
father
had
used
to
me
;
and
that
,
in
short
,
if
*NL*
I
would
ruin
myself
,
there
was
no
help
for
me
;
but
I
might
depend
I
*NL*
should
never
have
their
consent
to
it
;
that
for
her
part
she
would
not
*NL*
have
so
much
hand
in
my
destruction
;
and
I
should
never
have
it
to
say
*NL*
that
my
mother
was
willing
when
my
father
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
my
mother
refused
to
move
it
to
my
father
,
yet
I
heard
afterwards
*NL*
that
she
reported
all
the
discourse
to
him
,
and
that
my
father
,
after
*NL*
showing
a
great
concern
at
it
,
said
to
her
,
with
a
sigh
,
``
That
boy
might
*NL*
be
happy
if
he
would
stay
at
home
;
but
if
he
goes
abroad
,
he
will
be
the
*NL*
most
miserable
wretch
that
ever
was
born
:
I
can
give
no
consent
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
almost
a
year
after
this
that
I
broke
loose
,
though
,
in
*NL*
the
meantime
,
I
continued
obstinately
deaf
to
all
proposals
of
settling
*NL*
to
business
,
and
frequently
expostulated
with
my
father
and
mother
about
*NL*
their
being
so
positively
determined
against
what
they
knew
my
*NL*
inclinations
prompted
me
to
.
But
being
one
day
at
Hull
,
where
I
went
*NL*
casually
,
and
without
any
purpose
of
making
an
elopement
at
that
time
;
*NL*
but
,
I
say
,
being
there
,
and
one
of
my
companions
being
about
to
sail
to
*NL*
London
in
his
father
's
ship
,
and
prompting
me
to
go
with
them
with
the
*NL*
common
allurement
of
seafaring
men
,
that
it
should
cost
me
nothing
for
my
*NL*
passage
,
I
consulted
neither
father
nor
mother
any
more
,
nor
so
much
as
*NL*
sent
them
word
of
it
;
but
leaving
them
to
hear
of
it
as
they
might
,
*NL*
without
asking
God
's
blessing
or
my
father
's
,
without
any
consideration
*NL*
of
circumstances
or
consequences
,
and
in
an
ill
hour
,
God
knows
,
on
the
*NL*
1st
of
September
1651
,
I
went
on
board
a
ship
bound
for
London
.
Never
*NL*
any
young
adventurer
's
misfortunes
,
I
believe
,
began
sooner
,
or
continued
*NL*
longer
than
mine
.
The
ship
was
no
sooner
out
of
the
Humber
than
the
wind
*NL*
began
to
blow
and
the
sea
to
rise
in
a
most
frightful
manner
;
and
,
as
I
*NL*
had
never
been
at
sea
before
,
I
was
most
inexpressibly
sick
in
body
and
*NL*
terrified
in
mind
.
I
began
now
seriously
to
reflect
upon
what
I
had
*NL*
done
,
and
how
justly
I
was
overtaken
by
the
judgment
of
Heaven
for
my
*NL*
wicked
leaving
my
father
's
house
,
and
abandoning
my
duty
.
All
the
good
*NL*
counsels
of
my
parents
,
my
father
's
tears
and
my
mother
's
entreaties
,
*NL*
came
now
fresh
into
my
mind
;
and
my
conscience
,
which
was
not
yet
come
to
*NL*
the
pitch
of
hardness
to
which
it
has
since
,
reproached
me
with
the
*NL*
contempt
of
advice
,
and
the
breach
of
my
duty
to
God
and
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
the
storm
increased
,
and
the
sea
went
very
high
,
though
*NL*
nothing
like
what
I
have
seen
many
times
since
;
no
,
nor
what
I
saw
a
few
*NL*
days
after
;
but
it
was
enough
to
affect
me
then
,
who
was
but
a
young
*NL*
sailor
,
and
had
never
known
anything
of
the
matter
.
I
expected
every
*NL*
wave
would
have
swallowed
us
up
,
and
that
every
time
the
ship
fell
down
,
*NL*
as
I
thought
it
did
,
in
the
trough
or
hollow
of
the
sea
,
we
should
never
*NL*
rise
more
;
in
this
agony
of
mind
,
I
made
many
vows
and
resolutions
that
*NL*
if
it
would
please
God
to
spare
my
life
in
this
one
voyage
,
if
ever
I
got
*NL*
once
my
foot
upon
dry
land
again
,
I
would
go
directly
home
to
my
father
,
*NL*
and
never
set
it
into
a
ship
again
while
I
lived
;
that
I
would
take
his
*NL*
advice
,
and
never
run
myself
into
such
miseries
as
these
any
more
.
Now
I
*NL*
saw
plainly
the
goodness
of
his
observations
about
the
middle
station
of
*NL*
life
,
how
easy
,
how
comfortably
he
had
lived
all
his
days
,
and
never
had
*NL*
been
exposed
to
tempests
at
sea
or
troubles
on
shore
;
and
I
resolved
that
*NL*
I
would
,
like
a
true
repenting
prodigal
,
go
home
to
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
wise
and
sober
thoughts
continued
all
the
while
the
storm
lasted
,
*NL*
and
indeed
some
time
after
;
but
the
next
day
the
wind
was
abated
,
and
the
*NL*
sea
calmer
,
and
I
began
to
be
a
little
inured
to
it
;
however
,
I
was
very
*NL*
grave
for
all
that
day
,
being
also
a
little
sea-sick
still
;
but
towards
*NL*
night
the
weather
cleared
up
,
the
wind
was
quite
over
,
and
a
charming
*NL*
fine
evening
followed
;
the
sun
went
down
perfectly
clear
,
and
rose
so
the
*NL*
next
morning
;
and
having
little
or
no
wind
,
and
a
smooth
sea
,
the
sun
*NL*
shining
upon
it
,
the
sight
was
,
as
I
thought
,
the
most
delightful
that
*NL*
ever
I
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
slept
well
in
the
night
,
and
was
now
no
more
sea-sick
,
but
very
*NL*
cheerful
,
looking
with
wonder
upon
the
sea
that
was
so
rough
and
terrible
*NL*
the
day
before
,
and
could
be
so
calm
and
so
pleasant
in
so
little
a
time
*NL*
after
.
And
now
,
lest
my
good
resolutions
should
continue
,
my
companion
,
*NL*
who
had
enticed
me
away
,
comes
to
me
;
``
Well
,
Bob
,
''
says
he
,
clapping
me
*NL*
upon
the
shoulder
,
``
how
do
you
do
after
it
?
I
warrant
you
were
frighted
,
*NL*
wer
'n'
t
you
,
last
night
,
when
it
blew
but
a
capful
of
wind
?
''
``
A
capful
*NL*
d'you
call
it
?
''
said
I
;
''
't
was
a
terrible
storm
.
''
``
A
storm
,
you
fool
*NL*
you
,
''
replies
he
;
``
do
you
call
that
a
storm
?
why
,
it
was
nothing
at
all
;
*NL*
give
us
but
a
good
ship
and
sea-room
,
and
we
think
nothing
of
such
a
*NL*
squall
of
wind
as
that
;
but
you
're
but
a
fresh-water
sailor
,
Bob
.
Come
,
*NL*
let
us
make
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
we
'll
forget
all
that
;
d'ye
see
what
*NL*
charming
weather
't
is
now
?
''
To
make
short
this
sad
part
of
my
story
,
we
*NL*
went
the
way
of
all
sailors
;
the
punch
was
made
and
I
was
made
half
drunk
*NL*
with
it
:
and
in
that
one
night
's
wickedness
I
drowned
all
my
repentance
,
*NL*
all
my
reflections
upon
my
past
conduct
,
all
my
resolutions
for
the
*NL*
future
.
In
a
word
,
as
the
sea
was
returned
to
its
smoothness
of
surface
*NL*
and
settled
calmness
by
the
abatement
of
that
storm
,
so
the
hurry
of
my
*NL*
thoughts
being
over
,
my
fears
and
apprehensions
of
being
swallowed
up
by
*NL*
the
sea
being
forgotten
,
and
the
current
of
my
former
desires
returned
,
I
*NL*
entirely
forgot
the
vows
and
promises
that
I
made
in
my
distress
.
I
*NL*
found
,
indeed
,
some
intervals
of
reflection
;
and
the
serious
thoughts
*NL*
did
,
as
it
were
,
endeavour
to
return
again
sometimes
;
but
I
shook
them
*NL*
off
,
and
roused
myself
from
them
as
it
were
from
a
distemper
,
and
*NL*
applying
myself
to
drinking
and
company
,
soon
mastered
the
return
of
*NL*
those
fits
--
for
so
I
called
them
;
and
I
had
in
five
or
six
days
got
as
*NL*
complete
a
victory
over
conscience
as
any
young
fellow
that
resolved
not
*NL*
to
be
troubled
with
it
could
desire
.
But
I
was
to
have
another
trial
for
*NL*
it
still
;
and
Providence
,
as
in
such
cases
generally
it
does
,
resolved
to
*NL*
leave
me
entirely
without
excuse
;
for
if
I
would
not
take
this
for
a
*NL*
deliverance
,
the
next
was
to
be
such
a
one
as
the
worst
and
most
hardened
*NL*
wretch
among
us
would
confess
both
the
danger
and
the
mercy
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sixth
day
of
our
being
at
sea
we
came
into
Yarmouth
Roads
;
the
wind
*NL*
having
been
contrary
and
the
weather
calm
,
we
had
made
but
little
way
*NL*
since
the
storm
.
Here
we
were
obliged
to
come
to
an
anchor
,
and
here
we
*NL*
lay
,
the
wind
continuing
contrary
--
viz
.
at
south-west
--
for
seven
or
eight
*NL*
days
,
during
which
time
a
great
many
ships
from
Newcastle
came
into
the
*NL*
same
Roads
,
as
the
common
harbour
where
the
ships
might
wait
for
a
wind
*NL*
for
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
not
,
however
,
rid
here
so
long
but
we
should
have
tided
it
up
the
*NL*
river
,
but
that
the
wind
blew
too
fresh
,
and
after
we
had
lain
four
or
*NL*
five
days
,
blew
very
hard
.
However
,
the
Roads
being
reckoned
as
good
as
*NL*
a
harbour
,
the
anchorage
good
,
and
our
ground-tackle
very
strong
,
our
men
*NL*
were
unconcerned
,
and
not
in
the
least
apprehensive
of
danger
,
but
spent
*NL*
the
time
in
rest
and
mirth
,
after
the
manner
of
the
sea
;
but
the
eighth
*NL*
day
,
in
the
morning
,
the
wind
increased
,
and
we
had
all
hands
at
work
to
*NL*
strike
our
topmasts
,
and
make
everything
snug
and
close
,
that
the
ship
*NL*
might
ride
as
easy
as
possible
.
By
noon
the
sea
went
very
high
indeed
,
*NL*
and
our
ship
rode
forecastle
in
,
shipped
several
seas
,
and
we
thought
*NL*
once
or
twice
our
anchor
had
come
home
;
upon
which
our
master
ordered
out
*NL*
the
sheet-anchor
,
so
that
we
rode
with
two
anchors
ahead
,
and
the
cables
*NL*
veered
out
to
the
bitter
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
it
blew
a
terrible
storm
indeed
;
and
now
I
began
to
see
*NL*
terror
and
amazement
in
the
faces
even
of
the
seamen
themselves
.
The
*NL*
master
,
though
vigilant
in
the
business
of
preserving
the
ship
,
yet
as
he
*NL*
went
in
and
out
of
his
cabin
by
me
,
I
could
hear
him
softly
to
himself
*NL*
say
,
several
times
,
``
Lord
be
merciful
to
us
!
we
shall
be
all
lost
!
we
*NL*
shall
be
all
undone
!
''
and
the
like
.
During
these
first
hurries
I
was
*NL*
stupid
,
lying
still
in
my
cabin
,
which
was
in
the
steerage
,
and
can
not
*NL*
describe
my
temper
:
I
could
ill
resume
the
first
penitence
which
I
had
so
*NL*
apparently
trampled
upon
and
hardened
myself
against
:
I
thought
the
*NL*
bitterness
of
death
had
been
past
,
and
that
this
would
be
nothing
like
*NL*
the
first
;
but
when
the
master
himself
came
by
me
,
as
I
said
just
now
,
*NL*
and
said
we
should
be
all
lost
,
I
was
dreadfully
frighted
.
I
got
up
out
*NL*
of
my
cabin
and
looked
out
;
but
such
a
dismal
sight
I
never
saw
:
the
sea
*NL*
ran
mountains
high
,
and
broke
upon
us
every
three
or
four
minutes
;
when
I
*NL*
could
look
about
,
I
could
see
nothing
but
distress
round
us
;
two
ships
*NL*
that
rode
near
us
,
we
found
,
had
cut
their
masts
by
the
board
,
being
deep
*NL*
laden
;
and
our
men
cried
out
that
a
ship
which
rode
about
a
mile
ahead
of
*NL*
us
was
foundered
.
Two
more
ships
,
being
driven
from
their
anchors
,
were
*NL*
run
out
of
the
Roads
to
sea
,
at
all
adventures
,
and
that
with
not
a
mast
*NL*
standing
.
The
light
ships
fared
the
best
,
as
not
so
much
labouring
in
*NL*
the
sea
;
but
two
or
three
of
them
drove
,
and
came
close
by
us
,
running
*NL*
away
with
only
their
spritsail
out
before
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
evening
the
mate
and
boatswain
begged
the
master
of
our
ship
to
*NL*
let
them
cut
away
the
fore-mast
,
which
he
was
very
unwilling
to
do
;
but
*NL*
the
boatswain
protesting
to
him
that
if
he
did
not
the
ship
would
*NL*
founder
,
he
consented
;
and
when
they
had
cut
away
the
fore-mast
,
the
*NL*
main-mast
stood
so
loose
,
and
shook
the
ship
so
much
,
they
were
obliged
*NL*
to
cut
that
away
also
,
and
make
a
clear
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
may
judge
what
a
condition
I
must
be
in
at
all
this
,
who
was
but
*NL*
a
young
sailor
,
and
who
had
been
in
such
a
fright
before
at
but
a
little
.
*NL*
But
if
I
can
express
at
this
distance
the
thoughts
I
had
about
me
at
that
*NL*
time
,
I
was
in
tenfold
more
horror
of
mind
upon
account
of
my
former
*NL*
convictions
,
and
the
having
returned
from
them
to
the
resolutions
I
had
*NL*
wickedly
taken
at
first
,
than
I
was
at
death
itself
;
and
these
,
added
to
*NL*
the
terror
of
the
storm
,
put
me
into
such
a
condition
that
I
can
by
no
*NL*
words
describe
it
.
But
the
worst
was
not
come
yet
;
the
storm
continued
*NL*
with
such
fury
that
the
seamen
themselves
acknowledged
they
had
never
*NL*
seen
a
worse
.
We
had
a
good
ship
,
but
she
was
deep
laden
,
and
wallowed
*NL*
in
the
sea
,
so
that
the
seamen
every
now
and
then
cried
out
she
would
*NL*
founder
.
It
was
my
advantage
in
one
respect
,
that
I
did
not
know
what
*NL*
they
meant
by
_
founder
_
till
I
inquired
.
However
,
the
storm
was
so
*NL*
violent
that
I
saw
,
what
is
not
often
seen
,
the
master
,
the
boatswain
,
*NL*
and
some
others
more
sensible
than
the
rest
,
at
their
prayers
,
and
*NL*
expecting
every
moment
when
the
ship
would
go
to
the
bottom
.
In
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
night
,
and
under
all
the
rest
of
our
distresses
,
one
of
the
*NL*
men
that
had
been
down
to
see
cried
out
we
had
sprung
a
leak
;
another
*NL*
said
there
was
four
feet
water
in
the
hold
.
Then
all
hands
were
called
*NL*
to
the
pump
.
At
that
word
,
my
heart
,
as
I
thought
,
died
within
me
:
and
I
*NL*
fell
backwards
upon
the
side
of
my
bed
where
I
sat
,
into
the
cabin
.
*NL*
However
,
the
men
roused
me
,
and
told
me
that
I
,
that
was
able
to
do
*NL*
nothing
before
,
was
as
well
able
to
pump
as
another
;
at
which
I
stirred
*NL*
up
and
went
to
the
pump
,
and
worked
very
heartily
.
While
this
was
doing
*NL*
the
master
,
seeing
some
light
colliers
,
who
,
not
able
to
ride
out
the
*NL*
storm
were
obliged
to
slip
and
run
away
to
sea
,
and
would
come
near
us
,
*NL*
ordered
to
fire
a
gun
as
a
signal
of
distress
.
I
,
who
knew
nothing
what
*NL*
they
meant
,
thought
the
ship
had
broken
,
or
some
dreadful
thing
happened
.
*NL*
In
a
word
,
I
was
so
surprised
that
I
fell
down
in
a
swoon
.
As
this
was
a
*NL*
time
when
everybody
had
his
own
life
to
think
of
,
nobody
minded
me
,
or
*NL*
what
was
become
of
me
;
but
another
man
stepped
up
to
the
pump
,
and
*NL*
thrusting
me
aside
with
his
foot
,
let
me
lie
,
thinking
I
had
been
dead
;
*NL*
and
it
was
a
great
while
before
I
came
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
worked
on
;
but
the
water
increasing
in
the
hold
,
it
was
apparent
that
*NL*
the
ship
would
founder
;
and
though
the
storm
began
to
abate
a
little
,
yet
*NL*
it
was
not
possible
she
could
swim
till
we
might
run
into
any
port
;
so
*NL*
the
master
continued
firing
guns
for
help
;
and
a
light
ship
,
who
had
rid
*NL*
it
out
just
ahead
of
us
,
ventured
a
boat
out
to
help
us
.
It
was
with
the
*NL*
utmost
hazard
the
boat
came
near
us
;
but
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
get
*NL*
on
board
,
or
for
the
boat
to
lie
near
the
ship
's
side
,
till
at
last
the
*NL*
men
rowing
very
heartily
,
and
venturing
their
lives
to
save
ours
,
our
men
*NL*
cast
them
a
rope
over
the
stern
with
a
buoy
to
it
,
and
then
veered
it
out
*NL*
a
great
length
,
which
they
,
after
much
labour
and
hazard
,
took
hold
of
,
*NL*
and
we
hauled
them
close
under
our
stern
,
and
got
all
into
their
boat
.
*NL*
It
was
to
no
purpose
for
them
or
us
,
after
we
were
in
the
boat
,
to
think
*NL*
of
reaching
their
own
ship
;
so
all
agreed
to
let
her
drive
,
and
only
to
*NL*
pull
her
in
towards
shore
as
much
as
we
could
;
and
our
master
promised
*NL*
them
,
that
if
the
boat
was
staved
upon
shore
,
he
would
make
it
good
to
*NL*
their
master
:
so
partly
rowing
and
partly
driving
,
our
boat
went
away
to
*NL*
the
northward
,
sloping
towards
the
shore
almost
as
far
as
Winterton
Ness
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
not
much
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
out
of
our
ship
till
we
*NL*
saw
her
sink
,
and
then
I
understood
for
the
first
time
what
was
meant
by
*NL*
a
ship
foundering
in
the
sea
.
I
must
acknowledge
I
had
hardly
eyes
to
*NL*
look
up
when
the
seamen
told
me
she
was
sinking
;
for
from
the
moment
that
*NL*
they
rather
put
me
into
the
boat
than
that
I
might
be
said
to
go
in
,
my
*NL*
heart
was
,
as
it
were
,
dead
within
me
,
partly
with
fright
,
partly
with
*NL*
horror
of
mind
,
and
the
thoughts
of
what
was
yet
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
in
this
condition
--
the
men
yet
labouring
at
the
oar
to
*NL*
bring
the
boat
near
the
shore
--
we
could
see
-LRB-
when
,
our
boat
mounting
the
*NL*
waves
,
we
were
able
to
see
the
shore
-RRB-
a
great
many
people
running
along
*NL*
the
strand
to
assist
us
when
we
should
come
near
;
but
we
made
but
slow
*NL*
way
towards
the
shore
;
nor
were
we
able
to
reach
the
shore
till
,
being
*NL*
past
the
lighthouse
at
Winterton
,
the
shore
falls
off
to
the
westward
*NL*
towards
Cromer
,
and
so
the
land
broke
off
a
little
the
violence
of
the
*NL*
wind
.
Here
we
got
in
,
and
though
not
without
much
difficulty
,
got
all
*NL*
safe
on
shore
,
and
walked
afterwards
on
foot
to
Yarmouth
,
where
,
as
*NL*
unfortunate
men
,
we
were
used
with
great
humanity
,
as
well
by
the
*NL*
magistrates
of
the
town
,
who
assigned
us
good
quarters
,
as
by
particular
*NL*
merchants
and
owners
of
ships
,
and
had
money
given
us
sufficient
to
carry
*NL*
us
either
to
London
or
back
to
Hull
as
we
thought
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
I
now
had
the
sense
to
have
gone
back
to
Hull
,
and
have
gone
home
,
I
*NL*
had
been
happy
,
and
my
father
,
as
in
our
blessed
Saviour
's
parable
,
had
*NL*
even
killed
the
fatted
calf
for
me
;
for
hearing
the
ship
I
went
away
in
*NL*
was
cast
away
in
Yarmouth
Roads
,
it
was
a
great
while
before
he
had
any
*NL*
assurances
that
I
was
not
drowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
ill
fate
pushed
me
on
now
with
an
obstinacy
that
nothing
could
*NL*
resist
;
and
though
I
had
several
times
loud
calls
from
my
reason
and
my
*NL*
more
composed
judgment
to
go
home
,
yet
I
had
no
power
to
do
it
.
I
know
*NL*
not
what
to
call
this
,
nor
will
I
urge
that
it
is
a
secret
overruling
*NL*
decree
,
that
hurries
us
on
to
be
the
instruments
of
our
own
destruction
,
*NL*
even
though
it
be
before
us
,
and
that
we
rush
upon
it
with
our
eyes
open
.
*NL*
Certainly
,
nothing
but
some
such
decreed
unavoidable
misery
,
which
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
me
to
escape
,
could
have
pushed
me
forward
against
the
*NL*
calm
reasonings
and
persuasions
of
my
most
retired
thoughts
,
and
against
*NL*
two
such
visible
instructions
as
I
had
met
with
in
my
first
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
comrade
,
who
had
helped
to
harden
me
before
,
and
who
was
the
master
's
*NL*
son
,
was
now
less
forward
than
I
.
The
first
time
he
spoke
to
me
after
we
*NL*
were
at
Yarmouth
,
which
was
not
till
two
or
three
days
,
for
we
were
*NL*
separated
in
the
town
to
several
quarters
;
I
say
,
the
first
time
he
saw
*NL*
me
,
it
appeared
his
tone
was
altered
;
and
,
looking
very
melancholy
,
and
*NL*
shaking
his
head
,
he
asked
me
how
I
did
,
and
telling
his
father
who
I
*NL*
was
,
and
how
I
had
come
this
voyage
only
for
a
trial
,
in
order
to
go
*NL*
further
abroad
,
his
father
,
turning
to
me
with
a
very
grave
and
concerned
*NL*
tone
``
Young
man
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
ought
never
to
go
to
sea
any
more
;
you
*NL*
ought
to
take
this
for
a
plain
and
visible
token
that
you
are
not
to
be
a
*NL*
seafaring
man
.
''
``
Why
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
will
you
go
to
sea
no
more
?
''
``
That
*NL*
is
another
case
,
''
said
he
;
``
it
is
my
calling
,
and
therefore
my
duty
;
but
*NL*
as
you
made
this
voyage
on
trial
,
you
see
what
a
taste
Heaven
has
given
*NL*
you
of
what
you
are
to
expect
if
you
persist
.
Perhaps
this
has
all
*NL*
befallen
us
on
your
account
,
like
Jonah
in
the
ship
of
Tarshish
.
Pray
,
''
*NL*
continues
he
,
``
what
are
you
;
and
on
what
account
did
you
go
to
sea
?
''
*NL*
Upon
that
I
told
him
some
of
my
story
;
at
the
end
of
which
he
burst
out
*NL*
into
a
strange
kind
of
passion
:
``
What
had
I
done
,
''
says
he
,
``
that
such
an
*NL*
unhappy
wretch
should
come
into
my
ship
?
I
would
not
set
my
foot
in
the
*NL*
same
ship
with
thee
again
for
a
thousand
pounds
.
''
This
indeed
was
,
as
I
*NL*
said
,
an
excursion
of
his
spirits
,
which
were
yet
agitated
by
the
sense
*NL*
of
his
loss
,
and
was
farther
than
he
could
have
authority
to
go
.
*NL*
However
,
he
afterwards
talked
very
gravely
to
me
,
exhorting
me
to
go
back
*NL*
to
my
father
,
and
not
tempt
Providence
to
my
ruin
,
telling
me
I
might
see
*NL*
a
visible
hand
of
Heaven
against
me
.
``
And
,
young
man
,
''
said
he
,
``
depend
*NL*
upon
it
,
if
you
do
not
go
back
,
wherever
you
go
,
you
will
meet
with
*NL*
nothing
but
disasters
and
disappointments
,
till
your
father
's
words
are
*NL*
fulfilled
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
parted
soon
after
;
for
I
made
him
little
answer
,
and
I
saw
him
no
*NL*
more
;
which
way
he
went
I
knew
not
.
As
for
me
,
having
some
money
in
my
*NL*
pocket
,
I
travelled
to
London
by
land
;
and
there
,
as
well
as
on
the
road
,
*NL*
had
many
struggles
with
myself
what
course
of
life
I
should
take
,
and
*NL*
whether
I
should
go
home
or
to
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
going
home
,
shame
opposed
the
best
motions
that
offered
to
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
it
immediately
occurred
to
me
how
I
should
be
laughed
at
*NL*
among
the
neighbours
,
and
should
be
ashamed
to
see
,
not
my
father
and
*NL*
mother
only
,
but
even
everybody
else
;
from
whence
I
have
since
often
*NL*
observed
,
how
incongruous
and
irrational
the
common
temper
of
mankind
is
,
*NL*
especially
of
youth
,
to
that
reason
which
ought
to
guide
them
in
such
*NL*
cases
--
viz
.
that
they
are
not
ashamed
to
sin
,
and
yet
are
ashamed
to
*NL*
repent
;
not
ashamed
of
the
action
for
which
they
ought
justly
to
be
*NL*
esteemed
fools
,
but
are
ashamed
of
the
returning
,
which
only
can
make
*NL*
them
be
esteemed
wise
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
life
,
however
,
I
remained
some
time
,
uncertain
what
*NL*
measures
to
take
,
and
what
course
of
life
to
lead
.
An
irresistible
*NL*
reluctance
continued
to
going
home
;
and
as
I
stayed
away
a
while
,
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
the
distress
I
had
been
in
wore
off
,
and
as
that
abated
,
*NL*
the
little
motion
I
had
in
my
desires
to
return
wore
off
with
it
,
till
at
*NL*
last
I
quite
laid
aside
the
thoughts
of
it
,
and
looked
out
for
a
voyage
.

CHAPTER
II
--
SLAVERY
AND
ESCAPE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
evil
influence
which
carried
me
first
away
from
my
father
's
*NL*
house
--
which
hurried
me
into
the
wild
and
indigested
notion
of
raising
my
*NL*
fortune
,
and
that
impressed
those
conceits
so
forcibly
upon
me
as
to
make
*NL*
me
deaf
to
all
good
advice
,
and
to
the
entreaties
and
even
the
commands
*NL*
of
my
father
--
I
say
,
the
same
influence
,
whatever
it
was
,
presented
the
*NL*
most
unfortunate
of
all
enterprises
to
my
view
;
and
I
went
on
board
a
*NL*
vessel
bound
to
the
coast
of
Africa
;
or
,
as
our
sailors
vulgarly
called
*NL*
it
,
a
voyage
to
Guinea
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
my
great
misfortune
that
in
all
these
adventures
I
did
not
ship
*NL*
myself
as
a
sailor
;
when
,
though
I
might
indeed
have
worked
a
little
*NL*
harder
than
ordinary
,
yet
at
the
same
time
I
should
have
learnt
the
duty
*NL*
and
office
of
a
fore-mast
man
,
and
in
time
might
have
qualified
myself
*NL*
for
a
mate
or
lieutenant
,
if
not
for
a
master
.
But
as
it
was
always
my
*NL*
fate
to
choose
for
the
worse
,
so
I
did
here
;
for
having
money
in
my
*NL*
pocket
and
good
clothes
upon
my
back
,
I
would
always
go
on
board
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
a
gentleman
;
and
so
I
neither
had
any
business
in
the
ship
,
nor
*NL*
learned
to
do
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
my
lot
first
of
all
to
fall
into
pretty
good
company
in
London
,
*NL*
which
does
not
always
happen
to
such
loose
and
misguided
young
fellows
as
*NL*
I
then
was
;
the
devil
generally
not
omitting
to
lay
some
snare
for
them
*NL*
very
early
;
but
it
was
not
so
with
me
.
I
first
got
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
master
of
a
ship
who
had
been
on
the
coast
of
Guinea
;
and
who
,
having
had
*NL*
very
good
success
there
,
was
resolved
to
go
again
.
This
captain
taking
a
*NL*
fancy
to
my
conversation
,
which
was
not
at
all
disagreeable
at
that
time
,
*NL*
hearing
me
say
I
had
a
mind
to
see
the
world
,
told
me
if
I
would
go
the
*NL*
voyage
with
him
I
should
be
at
no
expense
;
I
should
be
his
messmate
and
*NL*
his
companion
;
and
if
I
could
carry
anything
with
me
,
I
should
have
all
*NL*
the
advantage
of
it
that
the
trade
would
admit
;
and
perhaps
I
might
meet
*NL*
with
some
encouragement
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
embraced
the
offer
;
and
entering
into
a
strict
friendship
with
this
*NL*
captain
,
who
was
an
honest
,
plain-dealing
man
,
I
went
the
voyage
with
*NL*
him
,
and
carried
a
small
adventure
with
me
,
which
,
by
the
disinterested
*NL*
honesty
of
my
friend
the
captain
,
I
increased
very
considerably
;
for
I
*NL*
carried
about
40
pounds
in
such
toys
and
trifles
as
the
captain
directed
*NL*
me
to
buy
.
These
40
pounds
I
had
mustered
together
by
the
assistance
of
*NL*
some
of
my
relations
whom
I
corresponded
with
;
and
who
,
I
believe
,
got
my
*NL*
father
,
or
at
least
my
mother
,
to
contribute
so
much
as
that
to
my
first
*NL*
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
only
voyage
which
I
may
say
was
successful
in
all
my
*NL*
adventures
,
which
I
owe
to
the
integrity
and
honesty
of
my
friend
the
*NL*
captain
;
under
whom
also
I
got
a
competent
knowledge
of
the
mathematics
*NL*
and
the
rules
of
navigation
,
learned
how
to
keep
an
account
of
the
ship
's
*NL*
course
,
take
an
observation
,
and
,
in
short
,
to
understand
some
things
*NL*
that
were
needful
to
be
understood
by
a
sailor
;
for
,
as
he
took
delight
*NL*
to
instruct
me
,
I
took
delight
to
learn
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
this
voyage
made
*NL*
me
both
a
sailor
and
a
merchant
;
for
I
brought
home
five
pounds
nine
*NL*
ounces
of
gold-dust
for
my
adventure
,
which
yielded
me
in
London
,
at
my
*NL*
return
,
almost
300
pounds
;
and
this
filled
me
with
those
aspiring
*NL*
thoughts
which
have
since
so
completed
my
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
even
in
this
voyage
I
had
my
misfortunes
too
;
particularly
,
that
I
*NL*
was
continually
sick
,
being
thrown
into
a
violent
calenture
by
the
*NL*
excessive
heat
of
the
climate
;
our
principal
trading
being
upon
the
*NL*
coast
,
from
latitude
of
15
degrees
north
even
to
the
line
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
set
up
for
a
Guinea
trader
;
and
my
friend
,
to
my
great
*NL*
misfortune
,
dying
soon
after
his
arrival
,
I
resolved
to
go
the
same
*NL*
voyage
again
,
and
I
embarked
in
the
same
vessel
with
one
who
was
his
mate
*NL*
in
the
former
voyage
,
and
had
now
got
the
command
of
the
ship
.
This
was
*NL*
the
unhappiest
voyage
that
ever
man
made
;
for
though
I
did
not
carry
*NL*
quite
100
pounds
of
my
new-gained
wealth
,
so
that
I
had
200
pounds
left
,
*NL*
which
I
had
lodged
with
my
friend
's
widow
,
who
was
very
just
to
me
,
yet
I
*NL*
fell
into
terrible
misfortunes
.
The
first
was
this
:
our
ship
making
her
*NL*
course
towards
the
Canary
Islands
,
or
rather
between
those
islands
and
*NL*
the
African
shore
,
was
surprised
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
by
a
Turkish
*NL*
rover
of
Sallee
,
who
gave
chase
to
us
with
all
the
sail
she
could
make
.
*NL*
We
crowded
also
as
much
canvas
as
our
yards
would
spread
,
or
our
masts
*NL*
carry
,
to
get
clear
;
but
finding
the
pirate
gained
upon
us
,
and
would
*NL*
certainly
come
up
with
us
in
a
few
hours
,
we
prepared
to
fight
;
our
ship
*NL*
having
twelve
guns
,
and
the
rogue
eighteen
.
About
three
in
the
afternoon
*NL*
he
came
up
with
us
,
and
bringing
to
,
by
mistake
,
just
athwart
our
*NL*
quarter
,
instead
of
athwart
our
stern
,
as
he
intended
,
we
brought
eight
*NL*
of
our
guns
to
bear
on
that
side
,
and
poured
in
a
broadside
upon
him
,
*NL*
which
made
him
sheer
off
again
,
after
returning
our
fire
,
and
pouring
in
*NL*
also
his
small
shot
from
near
two
hundred
men
which
he
had
on
board
.
*NL*
However
,
we
had
not
a
man
touched
,
all
our
men
keeping
close
.
He
*NL*
prepared
to
attack
us
again
,
and
we
to
defend
ourselves
.
But
laying
us
*NL*
on
board
the
next
time
upon
our
other
quarter
,
he
entered
sixty
men
upon
*NL*
our
decks
,
who
immediately
fell
to
cutting
and
hacking
the
sails
and
*NL*
rigging
.
We
plied
them
with
small
shot
,
half-pikes
,
powder-chests
,
and
*NL*
such
like
,
and
cleared
our
deck
of
them
twice
.
However
,
to
cut
short
*NL*
this
melancholy
part
of
our
story
,
our
ship
being
disabled
,
and
three
of
*NL*
our
men
killed
,
and
eight
wounded
,
we
were
obliged
to
yield
,
and
were
*NL*
carried
all
prisoners
into
Sallee
,
a
port
belonging
to
the
Moors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usage
I
had
there
was
not
so
dreadful
as
at
first
I
apprehended
;
nor
*NL*
was
I
carried
up
the
country
to
the
emperor
's
court
,
as
the
rest
of
our
*NL*
men
were
,
but
was
kept
by
the
captain
of
the
rover
as
his
proper
prize
,
*NL*
and
made
his
slave
,
being
young
and
nimble
,
and
fit
for
his
business
.
At
*NL*
this
surprising
change
of
my
circumstances
,
from
a
merchant
to
a
*NL*
miserable
slave
,
I
was
perfectly
overwhelmed
;
and
now
I
looked
back
upon
*NL*
my
father
's
prophetic
discourse
to
me
,
that
I
should
be
miserable
and
*NL*
have
none
to
relieve
me
,
which
I
thought
was
now
so
effectually
brought
*NL*
to
pass
that
I
could
not
be
worse
;
for
now
the
hand
of
Heaven
had
*NL*
overtaken
me
,
and
I
was
undone
without
redemption
;
but
,
alas
!
this
was
*NL*
but
a
taste
of
the
misery
I
was
to
go
through
,
as
will
appear
in
the
*NL*
sequel
of
this
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
new
patron
,
or
master
,
had
taken
me
home
to
his
house
,
so
I
was
in
*NL*
hopes
that
he
would
take
me
with
him
when
he
went
to
sea
again
,
believing
*NL*
that
it
would
some
time
or
other
be
his
fate
to
be
taken
by
a
Spanish
or
*NL*
Portugal
man-of-war
;
and
that
then
I
should
be
set
at
liberty
.
But
this
*NL*
hope
of
mine
was
soon
taken
away
;
for
when
he
went
to
sea
,
he
left
me
on
*NL*
shore
to
look
after
his
little
garden
,
and
do
the
common
drudgery
of
*NL*
slaves
about
his
house
;
and
when
he
came
home
again
from
his
cruise
,
he
*NL*
ordered
me
to
lie
in
the
cabin
to
look
after
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
meditated
nothing
but
my
escape
,
and
what
method
I
might
take
to
*NL*
effect
it
,
but
found
no
way
that
had
the
least
probability
in
it
;
nothing
*NL*
presented
to
make
the
supposition
of
it
rational
;
for
I
had
nobody
to
*NL*
communicate
it
to
that
would
embark
with
me
--
no
fellow-slave
,
no
*NL*
Englishman
,
Irishman
,
or
Scotchman
there
but
myself
;
so
that
for
two
*NL*
years
,
though
I
often
pleased
myself
with
the
imagination
,
yet
I
never
*NL*
had
the
least
encouraging
prospect
of
putting
it
in
practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
about
two
years
,
an
odd
circumstance
presented
itself
,
which
put
*NL*
the
old
thought
of
making
some
attempt
for
my
liberty
again
in
my
head
.
*NL*
My
patron
lying
at
home
longer
than
usual
without
fitting
out
his
ship
,
*NL*
which
,
as
I
heard
,
was
for
want
of
money
,
he
used
constantly
,
once
or
*NL*
twice
a
week
,
sometimes
oftener
if
the
weather
was
fair
,
to
take
the
*NL*
ship
's
pinnace
and
go
out
into
the
road
a-fishing
;
and
as
he
always
took
*NL*
me
and
young
Maresco
with
him
to
row
the
boat
,
we
made
him
very
merry
,
*NL*
and
I
proved
very
dexterous
in
catching
fish
;
insomuch
that
sometimes
he
*NL*
would
send
me
with
a
Moor
,
one
of
his
kinsmen
,
and
the
youth
--
the
*NL*
Maresco
,
as
they
called
him
--
to
catch
a
dish
of
fish
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
one
time
,
that
going
a-fishing
in
a
calm
morning
,
a
fog
rose
*NL*
so
thick
that
,
though
we
were
not
half
a
league
from
the
shore
,
we
lost
*NL*
sight
of
it
;
and
rowing
we
knew
not
whither
or
which
way
,
we
laboured
all
*NL*
day
,
and
all
the
next
night
;
and
when
the
morning
came
we
found
we
had
*NL*
pulled
off
to
sea
instead
of
pulling
in
for
the
shore
;
and
that
we
were
*NL*
at
least
two
leagues
from
the
shore
.
However
,
we
got
well
in
again
,
*NL*
though
with
a
great
deal
of
labour
and
some
danger
;
for
the
wind
began
to
*NL*
blow
pretty
fresh
in
the
morning
;
but
we
were
all
very
hungry
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
our
patron
,
warned
by
this
disaster
,
resolved
to
take
more
care
of
*NL*
himself
for
the
future
;
and
having
lying
by
him
the
longboat
of
our
*NL*
English
ship
that
he
had
taken
,
he
resolved
he
would
not
go
a-fishing
any
*NL*
more
without
a
compass
and
some
provision
;
so
he
ordered
the
carpenter
of
*NL*
his
ship
,
who
also
was
an
English
slave
,
to
build
a
little
state-room
,
or
*NL*
cabin
,
in
the
middle
of
the
long-boat
,
like
that
of
a
barge
,
with
a
place
*NL*
to
stand
behind
it
to
steer
,
and
haul
home
the
main-sheet
;
the
room
*NL*
before
for
a
hand
or
two
to
stand
and
work
the
sails
.
She
sailed
with
*NL*
what
we
call
a
shoulder-of-mutton
sail
;
and
the
boom
jibed
over
the
top
*NL*
of
the
cabin
,
which
lay
very
snug
and
low
,
and
had
in
it
room
for
him
to
*NL*
lie
,
with
a
slave
or
two
,
and
a
table
to
eat
on
,
with
some
small
lockers
*NL*
to
put
in
some
bottles
of
such
liquor
as
he
thought
fit
to
drink
;
and
his
*NL*
bread
,
rice
,
and
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
frequently
out
with
this
boat
a-fishing
;
and
as
I
was
most
*NL*
dexterous
to
catch
fish
for
him
,
he
never
went
without
me
.
It
happened
*NL*
that
he
had
appointed
to
go
out
in
this
boat
,
either
for
pleasure
or
for
*NL*
fish
,
with
two
or
three
Moors
of
some
distinction
in
that
place
,
and
for
*NL*
whom
he
had
provided
extraordinarily
,
and
had
,
therefore
,
sent
on
board
*NL*
the
boat
overnight
a
larger
store
of
provisions
than
ordinary
;
and
had
*NL*
ordered
me
to
get
ready
three
fusees
with
powder
and
shot
,
which
were
on
*NL*
board
his
ship
,
for
that
they
designed
some
sport
of
fowling
as
well
as
*NL*
fishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
all
things
ready
as
he
had
directed
,
and
waited
the
next
morning
*NL*
with
the
boat
washed
clean
,
her
ancient
and
pendants
out
,
and
everything
*NL*
to
accommodate
his
guests
;
when
by-and-by
my
patron
came
on
board
alone
,
*NL*
and
told
me
his
guests
had
put
off
going
from
some
business
that
fell
*NL*
out
,
and
ordered
me
,
with
the
man
and
boy
,
as
usual
,
to
go
out
with
the
*NL*
boat
and
catch
them
some
fish
,
for
that
his
friends
were
to
sup
at
his
*NL*
house
,
and
commanded
that
as
soon
as
I
got
some
fish
I
should
bring
it
*NL*
home
to
his
house
;
all
which
I
prepared
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
moment
my
former
notions
of
deliverance
darted
into
my
thoughts
,
for
*NL*
now
I
found
I
was
likely
to
have
a
little
ship
at
my
command
;
and
my
*NL*
master
being
gone
,
I
prepared
to
furnish
myself
,
not
for
fishing
*NL*
business
,
but
for
a
voyage
;
though
I
knew
not
,
neither
did
I
so
much
as
*NL*
consider
,
whither
I
should
steer
--
anywhere
to
get
out
of
that
place
was
*NL*
my
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
contrivance
was
to
make
a
pretence
to
speak
to
this
Moor
,
to
get
*NL*
something
for
our
subsistence
on
board
;
for
I
told
him
we
must
not
*NL*
presume
to
eat
of
our
patron
's
bread
.
He
said
that
was
true
;
so
he
*NL*
brought
a
large
basket
of
rusk
or
biscuit
,
and
three
jars
of
fresh
water
,
*NL*
into
the
boat
.
I
knew
where
my
patron
's
case
of
bottles
stood
,
which
it
*NL*
was
evident
,
by
the
make
,
were
taken
out
of
some
English
prize
,
and
I
*NL*
conveyed
them
into
the
boat
while
the
Moor
was
on
shore
,
as
if
they
had
*NL*
been
there
before
for
our
master
.
I
conveyed
also
a
great
lump
of
*NL*
beeswax
into
the
boat
,
which
weighed
about
half
a
hundred-weight
,
with
a
*NL*
parcel
of
twine
or
thread
,
a
hatchet
,
a
saw
,
and
a
hammer
,
all
of
which
*NL*
were
of
great
use
to
us
afterwards
,
especially
the
wax
,
to
make
candles
.
*NL*
Another
trick
I
tried
upon
him
,
which
he
innocently
came
into
also
:
his
*NL*
name
was
Ismael
,
which
they
call
Muley
,
or
Moely
;
so
I
called
to
*NL*
him
--
``
Moely
,
''
said
I
,
``
our
patron
's
guns
are
on
board
the
boat
;
can
you
*NL*
not
get
a
little
powder
and
shot
?
It
may
be
we
may
kill
some
alcamies
-LRB-
a
*NL*
fowl
like
our
curlews
-RRB-
for
ourselves
,
for
I
know
he
keeps
the
gunner
's
*NL*
stores
in
the
ship
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
'll
bring
some
;
''
and
accordingly
*NL*
he
brought
a
great
leather
pouch
,
which
held
a
pound
and
a
half
of
*NL*
powder
,
or
rather
more
;
and
another
with
shot
,
that
had
five
or
six
*NL*
pounds
,
with
some
bullets
,
and
put
all
into
the
boat
.
At
the
same
time
I
*NL*
had
found
some
powder
of
my
master
's
in
the
great
cabin
,
with
which
I
*NL*
filled
one
of
the
large
bottles
in
the
case
,
which
was
almost
empty
,
*NL*
pouring
what
was
in
it
into
another
;
and
thus
furnished
with
everything
*NL*
needful
,
we
sailed
out
of
the
port
to
fish
.
The
castle
,
which
is
at
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
port
,
knew
who
we
were
,
and
took
no
notice
of
us
;
and
we
*NL*
were
not
above
a
mile
out
of
the
port
before
we
hauled
in
our
sail
and
*NL*
set
us
down
to
fish
.
The
wind
blew
from
the
N.N.E.
,
which
was
contrary
*NL*
to
my
desire
,
for
had
it
blown
southerly
I
had
been
sure
to
have
made
the
*NL*
coast
of
Spain
,
and
at
least
reached
to
the
bay
of
Cadiz
;
but
my
*NL*
resolutions
were
,
blow
which
way
it
would
,
I
would
be
gone
from
that
*NL*
horrid
place
where
I
was
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
we
had
fished
some
time
and
caught
nothing
--
for
when
I
had
fish
on
*NL*
my
hook
I
would
not
pull
them
up
,
that
he
might
not
see
them
--
I
said
to
*NL*
the
Moor
,
``
This
will
not
do
;
our
master
will
not
be
thus
served
;
we
must
*NL*
stand
farther
off
.
''
He
,
thinking
no
harm
,
agreed
,
and
being
in
the
head
*NL*
of
the
boat
,
set
the
sails
;
and
,
as
I
had
the
helm
,
I
ran
the
boat
out
*NL*
near
a
league
farther
,
and
then
brought
her
to
,
as
if
I
would
fish
;
when
,
*NL*
giving
the
boy
the
helm
,
I
stepped
forward
to
where
the
Moor
was
,
and
*NL*
making
as
if
I
stooped
for
something
behind
him
,
I
took
him
by
surprise
*NL*
with
my
arm
under
his
waist
,
and
tossed
him
clear
overboard
into
the
sea
.
*NL*
He
rose
immediately
,
for
he
swam
like
a
cork
,
and
called
to
me
,
begged
to
*NL*
be
taken
in
,
told
me
he
would
go
all
over
the
world
with
me
.
He
swam
so
*NL*
strong
after
the
boat
that
he
would
have
reached
me
very
quickly
,
there
*NL*
being
but
little
wind
;
upon
which
I
stepped
into
the
cabin
,
and
fetching
*NL*
one
of
the
fowling-pieces
,
I
presented
it
at
him
,
and
told
him
I
had
done
*NL*
him
no
hurt
,
and
if
he
would
be
quiet
I
would
do
him
none
.
``
But
,
''
said
*NL*
I
,
``
you
swim
well
enough
to
reach
to
the
shore
,
and
the
sea
is
calm
;
make
*NL*
the
best
of
your
way
to
shore
,
and
I
will
do
you
no
harm
;
but
if
you
come
*NL*
near
the
boat
I
'll
shoot
you
through
the
head
,
for
I
am
resolved
to
have
*NL*
my
liberty
;
''
so
he
turned
himself
about
,
and
swam
for
the
shore
,
and
I
*NL*
make
no
doubt
but
he
reached
it
with
ease
,
for
he
was
an
excellent
*NL*
swimmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
have
been
content
to
have
taken
this
Moor
with
me
,
and
have
*NL*
drowned
the
boy
,
but
there
was
no
venturing
to
trust
him
.
When
he
was
*NL*
gone
,
I
turned
to
the
boy
,
whom
they
called
Xury
,
and
said
to
him
,
``
Xury
,
*NL*
if
you
will
be
faithful
to
me
,
I
'll
make
you
a
great
man
;
but
if
you
will
*NL*
not
stroke
your
face
to
be
true
to
me
''
--
that
is
,
swear
by
Mahomet
and
his
*NL*
father
's
beard
--
``
I
must
throw
you
into
the
sea
too
.
''
The
boy
smiled
in
*NL*
my
face
,
and
spoke
so
innocently
that
I
could
not
distrust
him
,
and
swore
*NL*
to
be
faithful
to
me
,
and
go
all
over
the
world
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
in
view
of
the
Moor
that
was
swimming
,
I
stood
out
directly
*NL*
to
sea
with
the
boat
,
rather
stretching
to
windward
,
that
they
might
*NL*
think
me
gone
towards
the
Straits
'
mouth
-LRB-
as
indeed
any
one
that
had
been
*NL*
in
their
wits
must
have
been
supposed
to
do
-RRB-
:
for
who
would
have
supposed
*NL*
we
were
sailed
on
to
the
southward
,
to
the
truly
Barbarian
coast
,
where
*NL*
whole
nations
of
negroes
were
sure
to
surround
us
with
their
canoes
and
*NL*
destroy
us
;
where
we
could
not
go
on
shore
but
we
should
be
devoured
by
*NL*
savage
beasts
,
or
more
merciless
savages
of
human
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
soon
as
it
grew
dusk
in
the
evening
,
I
changed
my
course
,
and
*NL*
steered
directly
south
and
by
east
,
bending
my
course
a
little
towards
*NL*
the
east
,
that
I
might
keep
in
with
the
shore
;
and
having
a
fair
,
fresh
*NL*
gale
of
wind
,
and
a
smooth
,
quiet
sea
,
I
made
such
sail
that
I
believe
by
*NL*
the
next
day
,
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
when
I
first
made
the
*NL*
land
,
I
could
not
be
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
south
of
*NL*
Sallee
;
quite
beyond
the
Emperor
of
Morocco
's
dominions
,
or
indeed
of
any
*NL*
other
king
thereabouts
,
for
we
saw
no
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
such
was
the
fright
I
had
taken
of
the
Moors
,
and
the
dreadful
*NL*
apprehensions
I
had
of
falling
into
their
hands
,
that
I
would
not
stop
,
*NL*
or
go
on
shore
,
or
come
to
an
anchor
;
the
wind
continuing
fair
till
I
had
*NL*
sailed
in
that
manner
five
days
;
and
then
the
wind
shifting
to
the
*NL*
southward
,
I
concluded
also
that
if
any
of
our
vessels
were
in
chase
of
*NL*
me
,
they
also
would
now
give
over
;
so
I
ventured
to
make
to
the
coast
,
*NL*
and
came
to
an
anchor
in
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
,
I
knew
not
what
,
*NL*
nor
where
,
neither
what
latitude
,
what
country
,
what
nation
,
or
what
*NL*
river
.
I
neither
saw
,
nor
desired
to
see
any
people
;
the
principal
thing
*NL*
I
wanted
was
fresh
water
.
We
came
into
this
creek
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
resolving
to
swim
on
shore
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
,
and
discover
the
*NL*
country
;
but
as
soon
as
it
was
quite
dark
,
we
heard
such
dreadful
noises
*NL*
of
the
barking
,
roaring
,
and
howling
of
wild
creatures
,
of
we
knew
not
*NL*
what
kinds
,
that
the
poor
boy
was
ready
to
die
with
fear
,
and
begged
of
*NL*
me
not
to
go
on
shore
till
day
.
``
Well
,
Xury
,
''
said
I
,
``
then
I
wo
n't
;
but
*NL*
it
may
be
that
we
may
see
men
by
day
,
who
will
be
as
bad
to
us
as
those
*NL*
lions
.
''
``
Then
we
give
them
the
shoot
gun
,
''
says
Xury
,
laughing
,
``
make
*NL*
them
run
wey
.
''
Such
English
Xury
spoke
by
conversing
among
us
slaves
.
*NL*
However
,
I
was
glad
to
see
the
boy
so
cheerful
,
and
I
gave
him
a
dram
*NL*
-LRB-
out
of
our
patron
's
case
of
bottles
-RRB-
to
cheer
him
up
.
After
all
,
Xury
's
*NL*
advice
was
good
,
and
I
took
it
;
we
dropped
our
little
anchor
,
and
lay
*NL*
still
all
night
;
I
say
still
,
for
we
slept
none
;
for
in
two
or
three
*NL*
hours
we
saw
vast
great
creatures
-LRB-
we
knew
not
what
to
call
them
-RRB-
of
many
*NL*
sorts
,
come
down
to
the
sea-shore
and
run
into
the
water
,
wallowing
and
*NL*
washing
themselves
for
the
pleasure
of
cooling
themselves
;
and
they
made
*NL*
such
hideous
howlings
and
yellings
,
that
I
never
indeed
heard
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
Xury
was
dreadfully
frighted
,
and
indeed
so
was
I
too
;
but
we
were
both
*NL*
more
frighted
when
we
heard
one
of
these
mighty
creatures
come
swimming
*NL*
towards
our
boat
;
we
could
not
see
him
,
but
we
might
hear
him
by
his
*NL*
blowing
to
be
a
monstrous
huge
and
furious
beast
.
Xury
said
it
was
a
*NL*
lion
,
and
it
might
be
so
for
aught
I
know
;
but
poor
Xury
cried
to
me
to
*NL*
weigh
the
anchor
and
row
away
;
``
No
,
''
says
I
,
``
Xury
;
we
can
slip
our
*NL*
cable
,
with
the
buoy
to
it
,
and
go
off
to
sea
;
they
can
not
follow
us
*NL*
far
.
''
I
had
no
sooner
said
so
,
but
I
perceived
the
creature
-LRB-
whatever
it
*NL*
was
-RRB-
within
two
oars
'
length
,
which
something
surprised
me
;
however
,
I
*NL*
immediately
stepped
to
the
cabin
door
,
and
taking
up
my
gun
,
fired
at
*NL*
him
;
upon
which
he
immediately
turned
about
and
swam
towards
the
shore
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
horrid
noises
,
and
hideous
cries
and
*NL*
howlings
that
were
raised
,
as
well
upon
the
edge
of
the
shore
as
higher
*NL*
within
the
country
,
upon
the
noise
or
report
of
the
gun
,
a
thing
I
have
*NL*
some
reason
to
believe
those
creatures
had
never
heard
before
:
this
*NL*
convinced
me
that
there
was
no
going
on
shore
for
us
in
the
night
on
that
*NL*
coast
,
and
how
to
venture
on
shore
in
the
day
was
another
question
too
;
*NL*
for
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
any
of
the
savages
had
been
as
bad
*NL*
as
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
lions
and
tigers
;
at
least
we
*NL*
were
equally
apprehensive
of
the
danger
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
that
as
it
would
,
we
were
obliged
to
go
on
shore
somewhere
or
other
*NL*
for
water
,
for
we
had
not
a
pint
left
in
the
boat
;
when
and
where
to
get
*NL*
to
it
was
the
point
.
Xury
said
,
if
I
would
let
him
go
on
shore
with
one
*NL*
of
the
jars
,
he
would
find
if
there
was
any
water
,
and
bring
some
to
me
.
*NL*
I
asked
him
why
he
would
go
?
why
I
should
not
go
,
and
he
stay
in
the
*NL*
boat
?
The
boy
answered
with
so
much
affection
as
made
me
love
him
ever
*NL*
after
.
Says
he
,
``
If
wild
mans
come
,
they
eat
me
,
you
go
wey
.
''
``
Well
,
*NL*
Xury
,
''
said
I
,
``
we
will
both
go
and
if
the
wild
mans
come
,
we
will
kill
*NL*
them
,
they
shall
eat
neither
of
us
.
''
So
I
gave
Xury
a
piece
of
rusk
*NL*
bread
to
eat
,
and
a
dram
out
of
our
patron
's
case
of
bottles
which
I
*NL*
mentioned
before
;
and
we
hauled
the
boat
in
as
near
the
shore
as
we
*NL*
thought
was
proper
,
and
so
waded
on
shore
,
carrying
nothing
but
our
arms
*NL*
and
two
jars
for
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
care
to
go
out
of
sight
of
the
boat
,
fearing
the
coming
of
*NL*
canoes
with
savages
down
the
river
;
but
the
boy
seeing
a
low
place
about
*NL*
a
mile
up
the
country
,
rambled
to
it
,
and
by-and-by
I
saw
him
come
*NL*
running
towards
me
.
I
thought
he
was
pursued
by
some
savage
,
or
frighted
*NL*
with
some
wild
beast
,
and
I
ran
forward
towards
him
to
help
him
;
but
when
*NL*
I
came
nearer
to
him
I
saw
something
hanging
over
his
shoulders
,
which
*NL*
was
a
creature
that
he
had
shot
,
like
a
hare
,
but
different
in
colour
,
*NL*
and
longer
legs
;
however
,
we
were
very
glad
of
it
,
and
it
was
very
good
*NL*
meat
;
but
the
great
joy
that
poor
Xury
came
with
,
was
to
tell
me
he
had
*NL*
found
good
water
and
seen
no
wild
mans
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
found
afterwards
that
we
need
not
take
such
pains
for
water
,
for
a
*NL*
little
higher
up
the
creek
where
we
were
we
found
the
water
fresh
when
*NL*
the
tide
was
out
,
which
flowed
but
a
little
way
up
;
so
we
filled
our
*NL*
jars
,
and
feasted
on
the
hare
he
had
killed
,
and
prepared
to
go
on
our
*NL*
way
,
having
seen
no
footsteps
of
any
human
creature
in
that
part
of
the
*NL*
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
had
been
one
voyage
to
this
coast
before
,
I
knew
very
well
that
the
*NL*
islands
of
the
Canaries
,
and
the
Cape
de
Verde
Islands
also
,
lay
not
far
*NL*
off
from
the
coast
.
But
as
I
had
no
instruments
to
take
an
observation
*NL*
to
know
what
latitude
we
were
in
,
and
not
exactly
knowing
,
or
at
least
*NL*
remembering
,
what
latitude
they
were
in
,
I
knew
not
where
to
look
for
*NL*
them
,
or
when
to
stand
off
to
sea
towards
them
;
otherwise
I
might
now
*NL*
easily
have
found
some
of
these
islands
.
But
my
hope
was
,
that
if
I
*NL*
stood
along
this
coast
till
I
came
to
that
part
where
the
English
traded
,
*NL*
I
should
find
some
of
their
vessels
upon
their
usual
design
of
trade
,
*NL*
that
would
relieve
and
take
us
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
best
of
my
calculation
,
that
place
where
I
now
was
must
be
that
*NL*
country
which
,
lying
between
the
Emperor
of
Morocco
's
dominions
and
the
*NL*
negroes
,
lies
waste
and
uninhabited
,
except
by
wild
beasts
;
the
negroes
*NL*
having
abandoned
it
and
gone
farther
south
for
fear
of
the
Moors
,
and
the
*NL*
Moors
not
thinking
it
worth
inhabiting
by
reason
of
its
barrenness
;
and
*NL*
indeed
,
both
forsaking
it
because
of
the
prodigious
number
of
tigers
,
*NL*
lions
,
leopards
,
and
other
furious
creatures
which
harbour
there
;
so
that
*NL*
the
Moors
use
it
for
their
hunting
only
,
where
they
go
like
an
army
,
two
*NL*
or
three
thousand
men
at
a
time
;
and
indeed
for
near
a
hundred
miles
*NL*
together
upon
this
coast
we
saw
nothing
but
a
waste
,
uninhabited
country
*NL*
by
day
,
and
heard
nothing
but
howlings
and
roaring
of
wild
beasts
by
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
or
twice
in
the
daytime
I
thought
I
saw
the
Pico
of
Teneriffe
,
being
*NL*
the
high
top
of
the
Mountain
Teneriffe
in
the
Canaries
,
and
had
a
great
*NL*
mind
to
venture
out
,
in
hopes
of
reaching
thither
;
but
having
tried
*NL*
twice
,
I
was
forced
in
again
by
contrary
winds
,
the
sea
also
going
too
*NL*
high
for
my
little
vessel
;
so
,
I
resolved
to
pursue
my
first
design
,
and
*NL*
keep
along
the
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
times
I
was
obliged
to
land
for
fresh
water
,
after
we
had
left
*NL*
this
place
;
and
once
in
particular
,
being
early
in
morning
,
we
came
to
an
*NL*
anchor
under
a
little
point
of
land
,
which
was
pretty
high
;
and
the
tide
*NL*
beginning
to
flow
,
we
lay
still
to
go
farther
in
.
Xury
,
whose
eyes
were
*NL*
more
about
him
than
it
seems
mine
were
,
calls
softly
to
me
,
and
tells
me
*NL*
that
we
had
best
go
farther
off
the
shore
;
``
For
,
''
says
he
,
``
look
,
yonder
*NL*
lies
a
dreadful
monster
on
the
side
of
that
hillock
,
fast
asleep
.
''
I
*NL*
looked
where
he
pointed
,
and
saw
a
dreadful
monster
indeed
,
for
it
was
a
*NL*
terrible
,
great
lion
that
lay
on
the
side
of
the
shore
,
under
the
shade
*NL*
of
a
piece
of
the
hill
that
hung
as
it
were
a
little
over
him
.
``
Xury
,
''
*NL*
says
I
,
``
you
shall
on
shore
and
kill
him
.
''
Xury
,
looked
frighted
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Me
kill
!
he
eat
me
at
one
mouth
!
''
--
one
mouthful
he
meant
.
*NL*
However
,
I
said
no
more
to
the
boy
,
but
bade
him
lie
still
,
and
I
took
*NL*
our
biggest
gun
,
which
was
almost
musket-bore
,
and
loaded
it
with
a
good
*NL*
charge
of
powder
,
and
with
two
slugs
,
and
laid
it
down
;
then
I
loaded
*NL*
another
gun
with
two
bullets
;
and
the
third
-LRB-
for
we
had
three
pieces
-RRB-
I
*NL*
loaded
with
five
smaller
bullets
.
I
took
the
best
aim
I
could
with
the
*NL*
first
piece
to
have
shot
him
in
the
head
,
but
he
lay
so
with
his
leg
*NL*
raised
a
little
above
his
nose
,
that
the
slugs
hit
his
leg
about
the
knee
*NL*
and
broke
the
bone
.
He
started
up
,
growling
at
first
,
but
finding
his
*NL*
leg
broken
,
fell
down
again
;
and
then
got
upon
three
legs
,
and
gave
the
*NL*
most
hideous
roar
that
ever
I
heard
.
I
was
a
little
surprised
that
I
had
*NL*
not
hit
him
on
the
head
;
however
,
I
took
up
the
second
piece
immediately
,
*NL*
and
though
he
began
to
move
off
,
fired
again
,
and
shot
him
in
the
head
,
*NL*
and
had
the
pleasure
to
see
him
drop
and
make
but
little
noise
,
but
lie
*NL*
struggling
for
life
.
Then
Xury
took
heart
,
and
would
have
me
let
him
go
*NL*
on
shore
.
``
Well
,
go
,
''
said
I
:
so
the
boy
jumped
into
the
water
and
*NL*
taking
a
little
gun
in
one
hand
,
swam
to
shore
with
the
other
hand
,
and
*NL*
coming
close
to
the
creature
,
put
the
muzzle
of
the
piece
to
his
ear
,
and
*NL*
shot
him
in
the
head
again
,
which
despatched
him
quite
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
game
indeed
to
us
,
but
this
was
no
food
;
and
I
was
very
sorry
to
*NL*
lose
three
charges
of
powder
and
shot
upon
a
creature
that
was
good
for
*NL*
nothing
to
us
.
However
,
Xury
said
he
would
have
some
of
him
;
so
he
comes
*NL*
on
board
,
and
asked
me
to
give
him
the
hatchet
.
``
For
what
,
Xury
?
''
said
*NL*
I.
``
Me
cut
off
his
head
,
''
said
he
.
However
,
Xury
could
not
cut
off
his
*NL*
head
,
but
he
cut
off
a
foot
,
and
brought
it
with
him
,
and
it
was
a
*NL*
monstrous
great
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
bethought
myself
,
however
,
that
,
perhaps
the
skin
of
him
might
,
one
way
*NL*
or
other
,
be
of
some
value
to
us
;
and
I
resolved
to
take
off
his
skin
if
*NL*
I
could
.
So
Xury
and
I
went
to
work
with
him
;
but
Xury
was
much
the
*NL*
better
workman
at
it
,
for
I
knew
very
ill
how
to
do
it
.
Indeed
,
it
took
*NL*
us
both
up
the
whole
day
,
but
at
last
we
got
off
the
hide
of
him
,
and
*NL*
spreading
it
on
the
top
of
our
cabin
,
the
sun
effectually
dried
it
in
two
*NL*
days
'
time
,
and
it
afterwards
served
me
to
lie
upon
.

CHAPTER
III
--
WRECKED
ON
A
DESERT
ISLAND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
stop
,
we
made
on
to
the
southward
continually
for
ten
or
*NL*
twelve
days
,
living
very
sparingly
on
our
provisions
,
which
began
to
*NL*
abate
very
much
,
and
going
no
oftener
to
the
shore
than
we
were
obliged
*NL*
to
for
fresh
water
.
My
design
in
this
was
to
make
the
river
Gambia
or
*NL*
Senegal
,
that
is
to
say
anywhere
about
the
Cape
de
Verde
,
where
I
was
in
*NL*
hopes
to
meet
with
some
European
ship
;
and
if
I
did
not
,
I
knew
not
what
*NL*
course
I
had
to
take
,
but
to
seek
for
the
islands
,
or
perish
there
among
*NL*
the
negroes
.
I
knew
that
all
the
ships
from
Europe
,
which
sailed
either
*NL*
to
the
coast
of
Guinea
or
to
Brazil
,
or
to
the
East
Indies
,
made
this
*NL*
cape
,
or
those
islands
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
put
the
whole
of
my
fortune
*NL*
upon
this
single
point
,
either
that
I
must
meet
with
some
ship
or
must
*NL*
perish
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
pursued
this
resolution
about
ten
days
longer
,
as
I
have
said
,
*NL*
I
began
to
see
that
the
land
was
inhabited
;
and
in
two
or
three
places
,
*NL*
as
we
sailed
by
,
we
saw
people
stand
upon
the
shore
to
look
at
us
;
we
*NL*
could
also
perceive
they
were
quite
black
and
naked
.
I
was
once
inclined
*NL*
to
have
gone
on
shore
to
them
;
but
Xury
was
my
better
counsellor
,
and
*NL*
said
to
me
,
``
No
go
,
no
go
.
''
However
,
I
hauled
in
nearer
the
shore
that
I
*NL*
might
talk
to
them
,
and
I
found
they
ran
along
the
shore
by
me
a
good
*NL*
way
.
I
observed
they
had
no
weapons
in
their
hand
,
except
one
,
who
had
a
*NL*
long
slender
stick
,
which
Xury
said
was
a
lance
,
and
that
they
could
*NL*
throw
them
a
great
way
with
good
aim
;
so
I
kept
at
a
distance
,
but
talked
*NL*
with
them
by
signs
as
well
as
I
could
;
and
particularly
made
signs
for
*NL*
something
to
eat
:
they
beckoned
to
me
to
stop
my
boat
,
and
they
would
*NL*
fetch
me
some
meat
.
Upon
this
I
lowered
the
top
of
my
sail
and
lay
by
,
*NL*
and
two
of
them
ran
up
into
the
country
,
and
in
less
than
half-an-hour
*NL*
came
back
,
and
brought
with
them
two
pieces
of
dried
flesh
and
some
corn
,
*NL*
such
as
is
the
produce
of
their
country
;
but
we
neither
knew
what
the
one
*NL*
or
the
other
was
;
however
,
we
were
willing
to
accept
it
,
but
how
to
come
*NL*
at
it
was
our
next
dispute
,
for
I
would
not
venture
on
shore
to
them
,
and
*NL*
they
were
as
much
afraid
of
us
;
but
they
took
a
safe
way
for
us
all
,
for
*NL*
they
brought
it
to
the
shore
and
laid
it
down
,
and
went
and
stood
a
great
*NL*
way
off
till
we
fetched
it
on
board
,
and
then
came
close
to
us
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
signs
of
thanks
to
them
,
for
we
had
nothing
to
make
them
amends
;
*NL*
but
an
opportunity
offered
that
very
instant
to
oblige
them
wonderfully
;
*NL*
for
while
we
were
lying
by
the
shore
came
two
mighty
creatures
,
one
*NL*
pursuing
the
other
-LRB-
as
we
took
it
-RRB-
with
great
fury
from
the
mountains
*NL*
towards
the
sea
;
whether
it
was
the
male
pursuing
the
female
,
or
whether
*NL*
they
were
in
sport
or
in
rage
,
we
could
not
tell
,
any
more
than
we
could
*NL*
tell
whether
it
was
usual
or
strange
,
but
I
believe
it
was
the
latter
;
*NL*
because
,
in
the
first
place
,
those
ravenous
creatures
seldom
appear
but
*NL*
in
the
night
;
and
,
in
the
second
place
,
we
found
the
people
terribly
*NL*
frighted
,
especially
the
women
.
The
man
that
had
the
lance
or
dart
did
*NL*
not
fly
from
them
,
but
the
rest
did
;
however
,
as
the
two
creatures
ran
*NL*
directly
into
the
water
,
they
did
not
offer
to
fall
upon
any
of
the
*NL*
negroes
,
but
plunged
themselves
into
the
sea
,
and
swam
about
,
as
if
they
*NL*
had
come
for
their
diversion
;
at
last
one
of
them
began
to
come
nearer
*NL*
our
boat
than
at
first
I
expected
;
but
I
lay
ready
for
him
,
for
I
had
*NL*
loaded
my
gun
with
all
possible
expedition
,
and
bade
Xury
load
both
the
*NL*
others
.
As
soon
as
he
came
fairly
within
my
reach
,
I
fired
,
and
shot
him
*NL*
directly
in
the
head
;
immediately
he
sank
down
into
the
water
,
but
rose
*NL*
instantly
,
and
plunged
up
and
down
,
as
if
he
were
struggling
for
life
,
*NL*
and
so
indeed
he
was
;
he
immediately
made
to
the
shore
;
but
between
the
*NL*
wound
,
which
was
his
mortal
hurt
,
and
the
strangling
of
the
water
,
he
*NL*
died
just
before
he
reached
the
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
express
the
astonishment
of
these
poor
creatures
at
*NL*
the
noise
and
fire
of
my
gun
:
some
of
them
were
even
ready
to
die
for
*NL*
fear
,
and
fell
down
as
dead
with
the
very
terror
;
but
when
they
saw
the
*NL*
creature
dead
,
and
sunk
in
the
water
,
and
that
I
made
signs
to
them
to
*NL*
come
to
the
shore
,
they
took
heart
and
came
,
and
began
to
search
for
the
*NL*
creature
.
I
found
him
by
his
blood
staining
the
water
;
and
by
the
help
*NL*
of
a
rope
,
which
I
slung
round
him
,
and
gave
the
negroes
to
haul
,
they
*NL*
dragged
him
on
shore
,
and
found
that
it
was
a
most
curious
leopard
,
*NL*
spotted
,
and
fine
to
an
admirable
degree
;
and
the
negroes
held
up
their
*NL*
hands
with
admiration
,
to
think
what
it
was
I
had
killed
him
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
creature
,
frighted
with
the
flash
of
fire
and
the
noise
of
the
*NL*
gun
,
swam
on
shore
,
and
ran
up
directly
to
the
mountains
from
whence
they
*NL*
came
;
nor
could
I
,
at
that
distance
,
know
what
it
was
.
I
found
quickly
*NL*
the
negroes
wished
to
eat
the
flesh
of
this
creature
,
so
I
was
willing
to
*NL*
have
them
take
it
as
a
favour
from
me
;
which
,
when
I
made
signs
to
them
*NL*
that
they
might
take
him
,
they
were
very
thankful
for
.
Immediately
they
*NL*
fell
to
work
with
him
;
and
though
they
had
no
knife
,
yet
,
with
a
*NL*
sharpened
piece
of
wood
,
they
took
off
his
skin
as
readily
,
and
much
more
*NL*
readily
,
than
we
could
have
done
with
a
knife
.
They
offered
me
some
of
*NL*
the
flesh
,
which
I
declined
,
pointing
out
that
I
would
give
it
them
;
but
*NL*
made
signs
for
the
skin
,
which
they
gave
me
very
freely
,
and
brought
me
a
*NL*
great
deal
more
of
their
provisions
,
which
,
though
I
did
not
understand
,
*NL*
yet
I
accepted
.
I
then
made
signs
to
them
for
some
water
,
and
held
out
*NL*
one
of
my
jars
to
them
,
turning
it
bottom
upward
,
to
show
that
it
was
*NL*
empty
,
and
that
I
wanted
to
have
it
filled
.
They
called
immediately
to
*NL*
some
of
their
friends
,
and
there
came
two
women
,
and
brought
a
great
*NL*
vessel
made
of
earth
,
and
burnt
,
as
I
supposed
,
in
the
sun
,
this
they
set
*NL*
down
to
me
,
as
before
,
and
I
sent
Xury
on
shore
with
my
jars
,
and
filled
*NL*
them
all
three
.
The
women
were
as
naked
as
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
furnished
with
roots
and
corn
,
such
as
it
was
,
and
water
;
and
*NL*
leaving
my
friendly
negroes
,
I
made
forward
for
about
eleven
days
more
,
*NL*
without
offering
to
go
near
the
shore
,
till
I
saw
the
land
run
out
a
*NL*
great
length
into
the
sea
,
at
about
the
distance
of
four
or
five
leagues
*NL*
before
me
;
and
the
sea
being
very
calm
,
I
kept
a
large
offing
to
make
*NL*
this
point
.
At
length
,
doubling
the
point
,
at
about
two
leagues
from
the
*NL*
land
,
I
saw
plainly
land
on
the
other
side
,
to
seaward
;
then
I
concluded
,
*NL*
as
it
was
most
certain
indeed
,
that
this
was
the
Cape
de
Verde
,
and
those
*NL*
the
islands
called
,
from
thence
,
Cape
de
Verde
Islands
.
However
,
they
*NL*
were
at
a
great
distance
,
and
I
could
not
well
tell
what
I
had
best
to
*NL*
do
;
for
if
I
should
be
taken
with
a
fresh
of
wind
,
I
might
neither
reach
*NL*
one
or
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
dilemma
,
as
I
was
very
pensive
,
I
stepped
into
the
cabin
and
sat
*NL*
down
,
Xury
having
the
helm
;
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
the
boy
cried
out
,
*NL*
``
Master
,
master
,
a
ship
with
a
sail
!
''
and
the
foolish
boy
was
frighted
*NL*
out
of
his
wits
,
thinking
it
must
needs
be
some
of
his
master
's
ships
*NL*
sent
to
pursue
us
,
but
I
knew
we
were
far
enough
out
of
their
reach
.
I
*NL*
jumped
out
of
the
cabin
,
and
immediately
saw
,
not
only
the
ship
,
but
that
*NL*
it
was
a
Portuguese
ship
;
and
,
as
I
thought
,
was
bound
to
the
coast
of
*NL*
Guinea
,
for
negroes
.
But
,
when
I
observed
the
course
she
steered
,
I
was
*NL*
soon
convinced
they
were
bound
some
other
way
,
and
did
not
design
to
come
*NL*
any
nearer
to
the
shore
;
upon
which
I
stretched
out
to
sea
as
much
as
I
*NL*
could
,
resolving
to
speak
with
them
if
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
the
sail
I
could
make
,
I
found
I
should
not
be
able
to
come
in
*NL*
their
way
,
but
that
they
would
be
gone
by
before
I
could
make
any
signal
*NL*
to
them
:
but
after
I
had
crowded
to
the
utmost
,
and
began
to
despair
,
*NL*
they
,
it
seems
,
saw
by
the
help
of
their
glasses
that
it
was
some
*NL*
European
boat
,
which
they
supposed
must
belong
to
some
ship
that
was
*NL*
lost
;
so
they
shortened
sail
to
let
me
come
up
.
I
was
encouraged
with
*NL*
this
,
and
as
I
had
my
patron
's
ancient
on
board
,
I
made
a
waft
of
it
to
*NL*
them
,
for
a
signal
of
distress
,
and
fired
a
gun
,
both
which
they
saw
;
for
*NL*
they
told
me
they
saw
the
smoke
,
though
they
did
not
hear
the
gun
.
Upon
*NL*
these
signals
they
very
kindly
brought
to
,
and
lay
by
for
me
;
and
in
*NL*
about
three
hours
;
time
I
came
up
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
asked
me
what
I
was
,
in
Portuguese
,
and
in
Spanish
,
and
in
French
,
*NL*
but
I
understood
none
of
them
;
but
at
last
a
Scotch
sailor
,
who
was
on
*NL*
board
,
called
to
me
:
and
I
answered
him
,
and
told
him
I
was
an
*NL*
Englishman
,
that
I
had
made
my
escape
out
of
slavery
from
the
Moors
,
at
*NL*
Sallee
;
they
then
bade
me
come
on
board
,
and
very
kindly
took
me
in
,
and
*NL*
all
my
goods
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
inexpressible
joy
to
me
,
which
any
one
will
believe
,
that
I
was
*NL*
thus
delivered
,
as
I
esteemed
it
,
from
such
a
miserable
and
almost
*NL*
hopeless
condition
as
I
was
in
;
and
I
immediately
offered
all
I
had
to
*NL*
the
captain
of
the
ship
,
as
a
return
for
my
deliverance
;
but
he
*NL*
generously
told
me
he
would
take
nothing
from
me
,
but
that
all
I
had
*NL*
should
be
delivered
safe
to
me
when
I
came
to
the
Brazils
.
``
For
,
''
says
*NL*
he
,
``
I
have
saved
your
life
on
no
other
terms
than
I
would
be
glad
to
be
*NL*
saved
myself
:
and
it
may
,
one
time
or
other
,
be
my
lot
to
be
taken
up
in
*NL*
the
same
condition
.
Besides
,
''
said
he
,
``
when
I
carry
you
to
the
Brazils
,
*NL*
so
great
a
way
from
your
own
country
,
if
I
should
take
from
you
what
you
*NL*
have
,
you
will
be
starved
there
,
and
then
I
only
take
away
that
life
I
*NL*
have
given
.
No
,
no
,
''
says
he
:
``
Seignior
Inglese
''
-LRB-
Mr.
Englishman
-RRB-
,
``
I
*NL*
will
carry
you
thither
in
charity
,
and
those
things
will
help
to
buy
your
*NL*
subsistence
there
,
and
your
passage
home
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
charitable
in
this
proposal
,
so
he
was
just
in
the
performance
*NL*
to
a
tittle
;
for
he
ordered
the
seamen
that
none
should
touch
anything
*NL*
that
I
had
:
then
he
took
everything
into
his
own
possession
,
and
gave
me
*NL*
back
an
exact
inventory
of
them
,
that
I
might
have
them
,
even
to
my
three
*NL*
earthen
jars
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
my
boat
,
it
was
a
very
good
one
;
and
that
he
saw
,
and
told
me
he
*NL*
would
buy
it
of
me
for
his
ship
's
use
;
and
asked
me
what
I
would
have
for
*NL*
it
?
I
told
him
he
had
been
so
generous
to
me
in
everything
that
I
could
*NL*
not
offer
to
make
any
price
of
the
boat
,
but
left
it
entirely
to
him
:
*NL*
upon
which
he
told
me
he
would
give
me
a
note
of
hand
to
pay
me
eighty
*NL*
pieces
of
eight
for
it
at
Brazil
;
and
when
it
came
there
,
if
any
one
*NL*
offered
to
give
more
,
he
would
make
it
up
.
He
offered
me
also
sixty
*NL*
pieces
of
eight
more
for
my
boy
Xury
,
which
I
was
loth
to
take
;
not
that
*NL*
I
was
unwilling
to
let
the
captain
have
him
,
but
I
was
very
loth
to
sell
*NL*
the
poor
boy
's
liberty
,
who
had
assisted
me
so
faithfully
in
procuring
my
*NL*
own
.
However
,
when
I
let
him
know
my
reason
,
he
owned
it
to
be
just
,
and
*NL*
offered
me
this
medium
,
that
he
would
give
the
boy
an
obligation
to
set
*NL*
him
free
in
ten
years
,
if
he
turned
Christian
:
upon
this
,
and
Xury
saying
*NL*
he
was
willing
to
go
to
him
,
I
let
the
captain
have
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
very
good
voyage
to
the
Brazils
,
and
I
arrived
in
the
Bay
de
*NL*
Todos
los
Santos
,
or
All
Saints
'
Bay
,
in
about
twenty-two
days
after
.
*NL*
And
now
I
was
once
more
delivered
from
the
most
miserable
of
all
*NL*
conditions
of
life
;
and
what
to
do
next
with
myself
I
was
to
consider
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
generous
treatment
the
captain
gave
me
I
can
never
enough
remember
:
*NL*
he
would
take
nothing
of
me
for
my
passage
,
gave
me
twenty
ducats
for
the
*NL*
leopard
's
skin
,
and
forty
for
the
lion
's
skin
,
which
I
had
in
my
boat
,
*NL*
and
caused
everything
I
had
in
the
ship
to
be
punctually
delivered
to
me
;
*NL*
and
what
I
was
willing
to
sell
he
bought
of
me
,
such
as
the
case
of
*NL*
bottles
,
two
of
my
guns
,
and
a
piece
of
the
lump
of
beeswax
--
for
I
had
*NL*
made
candles
of
the
rest
:
in
a
word
,
I
made
about
two
hundred
and
twenty
*NL*
pieces
of
eight
of
all
my
cargo
;
and
with
this
stock
I
went
on
shore
in
*NL*
the
Brazils
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
been
long
here
before
I
was
recommended
to
the
house
of
a
good
*NL*
honest
man
like
himself
,
who
had
an
_
ingenio
_
,
as
they
call
it
-LRB-
that
is
,
*NL*
a
plantation
and
a
sugar-house
-RRB-
.
I
lived
with
him
some
time
,
and
*NL*
acquainted
myself
by
that
means
with
the
manner
of
planting
and
making
of
*NL*
sugar
;
and
seeing
how
well
the
planters
lived
,
and
how
they
got
rich
*NL*
suddenly
,
I
resolved
,
if
I
could
get
a
licence
to
settle
there
,
I
would
*NL*
turn
planter
among
them
:
resolving
in
the
meantime
to
find
out
some
way
*NL*
to
get
my
money
,
which
I
had
left
in
London
,
remitted
to
me
.
To
this
*NL*
purpose
,
getting
a
kind
of
letter
of
naturalisation
,
I
purchased
as
much
*NL*
land
that
was
uncured
as
my
money
would
reach
,
and
formed
a
plan
for
my
*NL*
plantation
and
settlement
;
such
a
one
as
might
be
suitable
to
the
stock
*NL*
which
I
proposed
to
myself
to
receive
from
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
neighbour
,
a
Portuguese
,
of
Lisbon
,
but
born
of
English
parents
,
*NL*
whose
name
was
Wells
,
and
in
much
such
circumstances
as
I
was
.
I
call
*NL*
him
my
neighbour
,
because
his
plantation
lay
next
to
mine
,
and
we
went
on
*NL*
very
sociably
together
.
My
stock
was
but
low
,
as
well
as
his
;
and
we
*NL*
rather
planted
for
food
than
anything
else
,
for
about
two
years
.
*NL*
However
,
we
began
to
increase
,
and
our
land
began
to
come
into
order
;
so
*NL*
that
the
third
year
we
planted
some
tobacco
,
and
made
each
of
us
a
large
*NL*
piece
of
ground
ready
for
planting
canes
in
the
year
to
come
.
But
we
*NL*
both
wanted
help
;
and
now
I
found
,
more
than
before
,
I
had
done
wrong
in
*NL*
parting
with
my
boy
Xury
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
alas
!
for
me
to
do
wrong
that
never
did
right
,
was
no
great
wonder
.
*NL*
I
hail
no
remedy
but
to
go
on
:
I
had
got
into
an
employment
quite
remote
*NL*
to
my
genius
,
and
directly
contrary
to
the
life
I
delighted
in
,
and
for
*NL*
which
I
forsook
my
father
's
house
,
and
broke
through
all
his
good
advice
.
*NL*
Nay
,
I
was
coming
into
the
very
middle
station
,
or
upper
degree
of
low
*NL*
life
,
which
my
father
advised
me
to
before
,
and
which
,
if
I
resolved
to
*NL*
go
on
with
,
I
might
as
well
have
stayed
at
home
,
and
never
have
fatigued
*NL*
myself
in
the
world
as
I
had
done
;
and
I
used
often
to
say
to
myself
,
I
*NL*
could
have
done
this
as
well
in
England
,
among
my
friends
,
as
have
gone
*NL*
five
thousand
miles
off
to
do
it
among
strangers
and
savages
,
in
a
*NL*
wilderness
,
and
at
such
a
distance
as
never
to
hear
from
any
part
of
the
*NL*
world
that
had
the
least
knowledge
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
I
used
to
look
upon
my
condition
with
the
utmost
regret
.
*NL*
I
had
nobody
to
converse
with
,
but
now
and
then
this
neighbour
;
no
work
*NL*
to
be
done
,
but
by
the
labour
of
my
hands
;
and
I
used
to
say
,
I
lived
*NL*
just
like
a
man
cast
away
upon
some
desolate
island
,
that
had
nobody
*NL*
there
but
himself
.
But
how
just
has
it
been
--
and
how
should
all
men
*NL*
reflect
,
that
when
they
compare
their
present
conditions
with
others
that
*NL*
are
worse
,
Heaven
may
oblige
them
to
make
the
exchange
,
and
be
convinced
*NL*
of
their
former
felicity
by
their
experience
--
I
say
,
how
just
has
it
*NL*
been
,
that
the
truly
solitary
life
I
reflected
on
,
in
an
island
of
mere
*NL*
desolation
,
should
be
my
lot
,
who
had
so
often
unjustly
compared
it
with
*NL*
the
life
which
I
then
led
,
in
which
,
had
I
continued
,
I
had
in
all
*NL*
probability
been
exceeding
prosperous
and
rich
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
some
degree
settled
in
my
measures
for
carrying
on
the
*NL*
plantation
before
my
kind
friend
,
the
captain
of
the
ship
that
took
me
up
*NL*
at
sea
,
went
back
--
for
the
ship
remained
there
,
in
providing
his
lading
*NL*
and
preparing
for
his
voyage
,
nearly
three
months
--
when
telling
him
what
*NL*
little
stock
I
had
left
behind
me
in
London
,
he
gave
me
this
friendly
and
*NL*
sincere
advice
:
--
``
Seignior
Inglese
,
''
says
he
-LRB-
for
so
he
always
called
*NL*
me
-RRB-
,
``
if
you
will
give
me
letters
,
and
a
procuration
in
form
to
me
,
with
*NL*
orders
to
the
person
who
has
your
money
in
London
to
send
your
effects
to
*NL*
Lisbon
,
to
such
persons
as
I
shall
direct
,
and
in
such
goods
as
are
*NL*
proper
for
this
country
,
I
will
bring
you
the
produce
of
them
,
God
*NL*
willing
,
at
my
return
;
but
,
since
human
affairs
are
all
subject
to
*NL*
changes
and
disasters
,
I
would
have
you
give
orders
but
for
one
hundred
*NL*
pounds
sterling
,
which
,
you
say
,
is
half
your
stock
,
and
let
the
hazard
*NL*
be
run
for
the
first
;
so
that
,
if
it
come
safe
,
you
may
order
the
rest
*NL*
the
same
way
,
and
,
if
it
miscarry
,
you
may
have
the
other
half
to
have
*NL*
recourse
to
for
your
supply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
so
wholesome
advice
,
and
looked
so
friendly
,
that
I
could
not
*NL*
but
be
convinced
it
was
the
best
course
I
could
take
;
so
I
accordingly
*NL*
prepared
letters
to
the
gentlewoman
with
whom
I
had
left
my
money
,
and
a
*NL*
procuration
to
the
Portuguese
captain
,
as
he
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wrote
the
English
captain
's
widow
a
full
account
of
all
my
*NL*
adventures
--
my
slavery
,
escape
,
and
how
I
had
met
with
the
Portuguese
*NL*
captain
at
sea
,
the
humanity
of
his
behaviour
,
and
what
condition
I
was
*NL*
now
in
,
with
all
other
necessary
directions
for
my
supply
;
and
when
this
*NL*
honest
captain
came
to
Lisbon
,
he
found
means
,
by
some
of
the
English
*NL*
merchants
there
,
to
send
over
,
not
the
order
only
,
but
a
full
account
of
*NL*
my
story
to
a
merchant
in
London
,
who
represented
it
effectually
to
her
;
*NL*
whereupon
she
not
only
delivered
the
money
,
but
out
of
her
own
pocket
*NL*
sent
the
Portugal
captain
a
very
handsome
present
for
his
humanity
and
*NL*
charity
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
merchant
in
London
,
vesting
this
hundred
pounds
in
English
goods
,
*NL*
such
as
the
captain
had
written
for
,
sent
them
directly
to
him
at
Lisbon
,
*NL*
and
he
brought
them
all
safe
to
me
to
the
Brazils
;
among
which
,
without
*NL*
my
direction
-LRB-
for
I
was
too
young
in
my
business
to
think
of
them
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
had
taken
care
to
have
all
sorts
of
tools
,
ironwork
,
and
utensils
*NL*
necessary
for
my
plantation
,
and
which
were
of
great
use
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
cargo
arrived
I
thought
my
fortune
made
,
for
I
was
surprised
*NL*
with
the
joy
of
it
;
and
my
stood
steward
,
the
captain
,
had
laid
out
the
*NL*
five
pounds
,
which
my
friend
had
sent
him
for
a
present
for
himself
,
to
*NL*
purchase
and
bring
me
over
a
servant
,
under
bond
for
six
years
'
service
,
*NL*
and
would
not
accept
of
any
consideration
,
except
a
little
tobacco
,
which
*NL*
I
would
have
him
accept
,
being
of
my
own
produce
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
was
this
all
;
for
my
goods
being
all
English
manufacture
,
such
as
*NL*
cloths
,
stuffs
,
baize
,
and
things
particularly
valuable
and
desirable
in
*NL*
the
country
,
I
found
means
to
sell
them
to
a
very
great
advantage
;
so
*NL*
that
I
might
say
I
had
more
than
four
times
the
value
of
my
first
cargo
,
*NL*
and
was
now
infinitely
beyond
my
poor
neighbour
--
I
mean
in
the
*NL*
advancement
of
my
plantation
;
for
the
first
thing
I
did
,
I
bought
me
a
*NL*
negro
slave
,
and
an
European
servant
also
--
I
mean
another
besides
that
*NL*
which
the
captain
brought
me
from
Lisbon
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
abused
prosperity
is
oftentimes
made
the
very
means
of
our
*NL*
greatest
adversity
,
so
it
was
with
me
.
I
went
on
the
next
year
with
*NL*
great
success
in
my
plantation
:
I
raised
fifty
great
rolls
of
tobacco
on
*NL*
my
own
ground
,
more
than
I
had
disposed
of
for
necessaries
among
my
*NL*
neighbours
;
and
these
fifty
rolls
,
being
each
of
above
a
hundredweight
,
*NL*
were
well
cured
,
and
laid
by
against
the
return
of
the
fleet
from
Lisbon
:
*NL*
and
now
increasing
in
business
and
wealth
,
my
head
began
to
be
full
of
*NL*
projects
and
undertakings
beyond
my
reach
;
such
as
are
,
indeed
,
often
the
*NL*
ruin
of
the
best
heads
in
business
.
Had
I
continued
in
the
station
I
was
*NL*
now
in
,
I
had
room
for
all
the
happy
things
to
have
yet
befallen
me
for
*NL*
which
my
father
so
earnestly
recommended
a
quiet
,
retired
life
,
and
of
*NL*
which
he
had
so
sensibly
described
the
middle
station
of
life
to
be
full
*NL*
of
;
but
other
things
attended
me
,
and
I
was
still
to
be
the
wilful
agent
*NL*
of
all
my
own
miseries
;
and
particularly
,
to
increase
my
fault
,
and
*NL*
double
the
reflections
upon
myself
,
which
in
my
future
sorrows
I
should
*NL*
have
leisure
to
make
,
all
these
miscarriages
were
procured
by
my
apparent
*NL*
obstinate
adhering
to
my
foolish
inclination
of
wandering
abroad
,
and
*NL*
pursuing
that
inclination
,
in
contradiction
to
the
clearest
views
of
*NL*
doing
myself
good
in
a
fair
and
plain
pursuit
of
those
prospects
,
and
*NL*
those
measures
of
life
,
which
nature
and
Providence
concurred
to
present
*NL*
me
with
,
and
to
make
my
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
had
once
done
thus
in
my
breaking
away
from
my
parents
,
so
I
could
*NL*
not
be
content
now
,
but
I
must
go
and
leave
the
happy
view
I
had
of
being
*NL*
a
rich
and
thriving
man
in
my
new
plantation
,
only
to
pursue
a
rash
and
*NL*
immoderate
desire
of
rising
faster
than
the
nature
of
the
thing
admitted
;
*NL*
and
thus
I
cast
myself
down
again
into
the
deepest
gulf
of
human
misery
*NL*
that
ever
man
fell
into
,
or
perhaps
could
be
consistent
with
life
and
a
*NL*
state
of
health
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
come
,
then
,
by
the
just
degrees
to
the
particulars
of
this
part
of
my
*NL*
story
.
You
may
suppose
,
that
having
now
lived
almost
four
years
in
the
*NL*
Brazils
,
and
beginning
to
thrive
and
prosper
very
well
upon
my
*NL*
plantation
,
I
had
not
only
learned
the
language
,
but
had
contracted
*NL*
acquaintance
and
friendship
among
my
fellow-planters
,
as
well
as
among
*NL*
the
merchants
at
St.
Salvador
,
which
was
our
port
;
and
that
,
in
my
*NL*
discourses
among
them
,
I
had
frequently
given
them
an
account
of
my
two
*NL*
voyages
to
the
coast
of
Guinea
:
the
manner
of
trading
with
the
negroes
*NL*
there
,
and
how
easy
it
was
to
purchase
upon
the
coast
for
trifles
--
such
*NL*
as
beads
,
toys
,
knives
,
scissors
,
hatchets
,
bits
of
glass
,
and
the
*NL*
like
--
not
only
gold-dust
,
Guinea
grains
,
elephants
'
teeth
,
&
c.
,
but
*NL*
negroes
,
for
the
service
of
the
Brazils
,
in
great
numbers
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
listened
always
very
attentively
to
my
discourses
on
these
heads
,
*NL*
but
especially
to
that
part
which
related
to
the
buying
of
negroes
,
which
*NL*
was
a
trade
at
that
time
,
not
only
not
far
entered
into
,
but
,
as
far
as
*NL*
it
was
,
had
been
carried
on
by
assientos
,
or
permission
of
the
kings
of
*NL*
Spain
and
Portugal
,
and
engrossed
in
the
public
stock
:
so
that
few
*NL*
negroes
were
bought
,
and
these
excessively
dear
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
,
being
in
company
with
some
merchants
and
planters
of
my
*NL*
acquaintance
,
and
talking
of
those
things
very
earnestly
,
three
of
them
*NL*
came
to
me
next
morning
,
and
told
me
they
had
been
musing
very
much
upon
*NL*
what
I
had
discoursed
with
them
of
the
last
night
,
and
they
came
to
make
*NL*
a
secret
proposal
to
me
;
and
,
after
enjoining
me
to
secrecy
,
they
told
me
*NL*
that
they
had
a
mind
to
fit
out
a
ship
to
go
to
Guinea
;
that
they
had
all
*NL*
plantations
as
well
as
I
,
and
were
straitened
for
nothing
so
much
as
*NL*
servants
;
that
as
it
was
a
trade
that
could
not
be
carried
on
,
because
*NL*
they
could
not
publicly
sell
the
negroes
when
they
came
home
,
so
they
*NL*
desired
to
make
but
one
voyage
,
to
bring
the
negroes
on
shore
privately
,
*NL*
and
divide
them
among
their
own
plantations
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
the
question
*NL*
was
whether
I
would
go
their
supercargo
in
the
ship
,
to
manage
the
*NL*
trading
part
upon
the
coast
of
Guinea
;
and
they
offered
me
that
I
should
*NL*
have
my
equal
share
of
the
negroes
,
without
providing
any
part
of
the
*NL*
stock
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
fair
proposal
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
had
it
been
made
to
any
*NL*
one
that
had
not
had
a
settlement
and
a
plantation
of
his
own
to
look
*NL*
after
,
which
was
in
a
fair
way
of
coming
to
be
very
considerable
,
and
*NL*
with
a
good
stock
upon
it
;
but
for
me
,
that
was
thus
entered
and
*NL*
established
,
and
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
on
as
I
had
begun
,
for
three
*NL*
or
four
years
more
,
and
to
have
sent
for
the
other
hundred
pounds
from
*NL*
England
;
and
who
in
that
time
,
and
with
that
little
addition
,
could
*NL*
scarce
have
failed
of
being
worth
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
sterling
,
*NL*
and
that
increasing
too
--
for
me
to
think
of
such
a
voyage
was
the
most
*NL*
preposterous
thing
that
ever
man
in
such
circumstances
could
be
guilty
*NL*
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
,
that
was
born
to
be
my
own
destroyer
,
could
no
more
resist
the
*NL*
offer
than
I
could
restrain
my
first
rambling
designs
when
my
father
'
*NL*
good
counsel
was
lost
upon
me
.
In
a
word
,
I
told
them
I
would
go
with
*NL*
all
my
heart
,
if
they
would
undertake
to
look
after
my
plantation
in
my
*NL*
absence
,
and
would
dispose
of
it
to
such
as
I
should
direct
,
if
I
*NL*
miscarried
.
This
they
all
engaged
to
do
,
and
entered
into
writings
or
*NL*
covenants
to
do
so
;
and
I
made
a
formal
will
,
disposing
of
my
plantation
*NL*
and
effects
in
case
of
my
death
,
making
the
captain
of
the
ship
that
had
*NL*
saved
my
life
,
as
before
,
my
universal
heir
,
but
obliging
him
to
dispose
*NL*
of
my
effects
as
I
had
directed
in
my
will
;
one
half
of
the
produce
being
*NL*
to
himself
,
and
the
other
to
be
shipped
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
took
all
possible
caution
to
preserve
my
effects
and
to
keep
*NL*
up
my
plantation
.
Had
I
used
half
as
much
prudence
to
have
looked
into
*NL*
my
own
interest
,
and
have
made
a
judgment
of
what
I
ought
to
have
done
*NL*
and
not
to
have
done
,
I
had
certainly
never
gone
away
from
so
prosperous
*NL*
an
undertaking
,
leaving
all
the
probable
views
of
a
thriving
*NL*
circumstance
,
and
gone
upon
a
voyage
to
sea
,
attended
with
all
its
common
*NL*
hazards
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
reasons
I
had
to
expect
particular
*NL*
misfortunes
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
hurried
on
,
and
obeyed
blindly
the
dictates
of
my
fancy
rather
*NL*
than
my
reason
;
and
,
accordingly
,
the
ship
being
fitted
out
,
and
the
*NL*
cargo
furnished
,
and
all
things
done
,
as
by
agreement
,
by
my
partners
in
*NL*
the
voyage
,
I
went
on
board
in
an
evil
hour
,
the
1st
September
1659
,
*NL*
being
the
same
day
eight
years
that
I
went
from
my
father
and
mother
at
*NL*
Hull
,
in
order
to
act
the
rebel
to
their
authority
,
and
the
fool
to
my
*NL*
own
interests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
ship
was
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
tons
burden
,
carried
six
guns
*NL*
and
fourteen
men
,
besides
the
master
,
his
boy
,
and
myself
.
We
had
on
*NL*
board
no
large
cargo
of
goods
,
except
of
such
toys
as
were
fit
for
our
*NL*
trade
with
the
negroes
,
such
as
beads
,
bits
of
glass
,
shells
,
and
other
*NL*
trifles
,
especially
little
looking-glasses
,
knives
,
scissors
,
hatchets
,
*NL*
and
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
day
I
went
on
board
we
set
sail
,
standing
away
to
the
northward
*NL*
upon
our
own
coast
,
with
design
to
stretch
over
for
the
African
coast
*NL*
when
we
came
about
ten
or
twelve
degrees
of
northern
latitude
,
which
,
it
*NL*
seems
,
was
the
manner
of
course
in
those
days
.
We
had
very
good
weather
,
*NL*
only
excessively
hot
,
all
the
way
upon
our
own
coast
,
till
we
came
to
the
*NL*
height
of
Cape
St.
Augustino
;
from
whence
,
keeping
further
off
at
sea
,
we
*NL*
lost
sight
of
land
,
and
steered
as
if
we
were
bound
for
the
isle
Fernando
*NL*
de
Noronha
,
holding
our
course
N.E.
by
N.
,
and
leaving
those
isles
on
the
*NL*
east
.
In
this
course
we
passed
the
line
in
about
twelve
days
'
time
,
and
*NL*
were
,
by
our
last
observation
,
in
seven
degrees
twenty-two
minutes
*NL*
northern
latitude
,
when
a
violent
tornado
,
or
hurricane
,
took
us
quite
*NL*
out
of
our
knowledge
.
It
began
from
the
south-east
,
came
about
to
the
*NL*
north-west
,
and
then
settled
in
the
north-east
;
from
whence
it
blew
in
*NL*
such
a
terrible
manner
,
that
for
twelve
days
together
we
could
do
nothing
*NL*
but
drive
,
and
,
scudding
away
before
it
,
let
it
carry
us
whither
fate
and
*NL*
the
fury
of
the
winds
directed
;
and
,
during
these
twelve
days
,
I
need
not
*NL*
say
that
I
expected
every
day
to
be
swallowed
up
;
nor
,
indeed
,
did
any
in
*NL*
the
ship
expect
to
save
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
distress
we
had
,
besides
the
terror
of
the
storm
,
one
of
our
men
*NL*
die
of
the
calenture
,
and
one
man
and
the
boy
washed
overboard
.
About
*NL*
the
twelfth
day
,
the
weather
abating
a
little
,
the
master
made
an
*NL*
observation
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
found
that
he
was
in
about
eleven
*NL*
degrees
north
latitude
,
but
that
he
was
twenty-two
degrees
of
longitude
*NL*
difference
west
from
Cape
St.
Augustino
;
so
that
he
found
he
was
upon
the
*NL*
coast
of
Guiana
,
or
the
north
part
of
Brazil
,
beyond
the
river
Amazon
,
*NL*
toward
that
of
the
river
Orinoco
,
commonly
called
the
Great
River
;
and
*NL*
began
to
consult
with
me
what
course
he
should
take
,
for
the
ship
was
*NL*
leaky
,
and
very
much
disabled
,
and
he
was
going
directly
back
to
the
*NL*
coast
of
Brazil
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
positively
against
that
;
and
looking
over
the
charts
of
the
*NL*
sea-coast
of
America
with
him
,
we
concluded
there
was
no
inhabited
*NL*
country
for
us
to
have
recourse
to
till
we
came
within
the
circle
of
the
*NL*
Caribbee
Islands
,
and
therefore
resolved
to
stand
away
for
Barbadoes
;
*NL*
which
,
by
keeping
off
at
sea
,
to
avoid
the
indraft
of
the
Bay
or
Gulf
of
*NL*
Mexico
,
we
might
easily
perform
,
as
we
hoped
,
in
about
fifteen
days
'
*NL*
sail
;
whereas
we
could
not
possibly
make
our
voyage
to
the
coast
of
*NL*
Africa
without
some
assistance
both
to
our
ship
and
to
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
design
we
changed
our
course
,
and
steered
away
N.W.
by
W.
,
in
*NL*
order
to
reach
some
of
our
English
islands
,
where
I
hoped
for
relief
.
*NL*
But
our
voyage
was
otherwise
determined
;
for
,
being
in
the
latitude
of
*NL*
twelve
degrees
eighteen
minutes
,
a
second
storm
came
upon
us
,
which
*NL*
carried
us
away
with
the
same
impetuosity
westward
,
and
drove
us
so
out
*NL*
of
the
way
of
all
human
commerce
,
that
,
had
all
our
lives
been
saved
as
*NL*
to
the
sea
,
we
were
rather
in
danger
of
being
devoured
by
savages
than
*NL*
ever
returning
to
our
own
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
distress
,
the
wind
still
blowing
very
hard
,
one
of
our
men
early
*NL*
in
the
morning
cried
out
,
``
Land
!
''
and
we
had
no
sooner
run
out
of
the
*NL*
cabin
to
look
out
,
in
hopes
of
seeing
whereabouts
in
the
world
we
were
,
*NL*
than
the
ship
struck
upon
a
sand
,
and
in
a
moment
her
motion
being
so
*NL*
stopped
,
the
sea
broke
over
her
in
such
a
manner
that
we
expected
we
*NL*
should
all
have
perished
immediately
;
and
we
were
immediately
driven
into
*NL*
our
close
quarters
,
to
shelter
us
from
the
very
foam
and
spray
of
the
*NL*
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
easy
for
any
one
who
has
not
been
in
the
like
condition
to
*NL*
describe
or
conceive
the
consternation
of
men
in
such
circumstances
.
We
*NL*
knew
nothing
where
we
were
,
or
upon
what
land
it
was
we
were
*NL*
driven
--
whether
an
island
or
the
main
,
whether
inhabited
or
not
*NL*
inhabited
.
As
the
rage
of
the
wind
was
still
great
,
though
rather
less
*NL*
than
at
first
,
we
could
not
so
much
as
hope
to
have
the
ship
hold
many
*NL*
minutes
without
breaking
into
pieces
,
unless
the
winds
,
by
a
kind
of
*NL*
miracle
,
should
turn
immediately
about
.
In
a
word
,
we
sat
looking
upon
*NL*
one
another
,
and
expecting
death
every
moment
,
and
every
man
,
*NL*
accordingly
,
preparing
for
another
world
;
for
there
was
little
or
nothing
*NL*
more
for
us
to
do
in
this
.
That
which
was
our
present
comfort
,
and
all
*NL*
the
comfort
we
had
,
was
that
,
contrary
to
our
expectation
,
the
ship
did
*NL*
not
break
yet
,
and
that
the
master
said
the
wind
began
to
abate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
though
we
thought
that
the
wind
did
a
little
abate
,
yet
the
ship
*NL*
having
thus
struck
upon
the
sand
,
and
sticking
too
fast
for
us
to
expect
*NL*
her
getting
off
,
we
were
in
a
dreadful
condition
indeed
,
and
had
nothing
*NL*
to
do
but
to
think
of
saving
our
lives
as
well
as
we
could
.
We
had
a
*NL*
boat
at
our
stern
just
before
the
storm
,
but
she
was
first
staved
by
*NL*
dashing
against
the
ship
's
rudder
,
and
in
the
next
place
she
broke
away
,
*NL*
and
either
sunk
or
was
driven
off
to
sea
;
so
there
was
no
hope
from
her
.
*NL*
We
had
another
boat
on
board
,
but
how
to
get
her
off
into
the
sea
was
a
*NL*
doubtful
thing
.
However
,
there
was
no
time
to
debate
,
for
we
fancied
*NL*
that
the
ship
would
break
in
pieces
every
minute
,
and
some
told
us
she
*NL*
was
actually
broken
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
distress
the
mate
of
our
vessel
laid
hold
of
the
boat
,
and
with
*NL*
the
help
of
the
rest
of
the
men
got
her
slung
over
the
ship
's
side
;
and
*NL*
getting
all
into
her
,
let
go
,
and
committed
ourselves
,
being
eleven
in
*NL*
number
,
to
God
's
mercy
and
the
wild
sea
;
for
though
the
storm
was
abated
*NL*
considerably
,
yet
the
sea
ran
dreadfully
high
upon
the
shore
,
and
might
*NL*
be
well
called
_
den
wild
zee
_
,
as
the
Dutch
call
the
sea
in
a
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
our
case
was
very
dismal
indeed
;
for
we
all
saw
plainly
that
the
*NL*
sea
went
so
high
that
the
boat
could
not
live
,
and
that
we
should
be
*NL*
inevitably
drowned
.
As
to
making
sail
,
we
had
none
,
nor
if
we
had
could
*NL*
we
have
done
anything
with
it
;
so
we
worked
at
the
oar
towards
the
land
,
*NL*
though
with
heavy
hearts
,
like
men
going
to
execution
;
for
we
all
knew
*NL*
that
when
the
boat
came
near
the
shore
she
would
be
dashed
in
a
thousand
*NL*
pieces
by
the
breach
of
the
sea
.
However
,
we
committed
our
souls
to
God
*NL*
in
the
most
earnest
manner
;
and
the
wind
driving
us
towards
the
shore
,
we
*NL*
hastened
our
destruction
with
our
own
hands
,
pulling
as
well
as
we
could
*NL*
towards
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
the
shore
was
,
whether
rock
or
sand
,
whether
steep
or
shoal
,
we
knew
*NL*
not
.
The
only
hope
that
could
rationally
give
us
the
least
shadow
of
*NL*
expectation
was
,
if
we
might
find
some
bay
or
gulf
,
or
the
mouth
of
some
*NL*
river
,
where
by
great
chance
we
might
have
run
our
boat
in
,
or
got
under
*NL*
the
lee
of
the
land
,
and
perhaps
made
smooth
water
.
But
there
was
*NL*
nothing
like
this
appeared
;
but
as
we
made
nearer
and
nearer
the
shore
,
*NL*
the
land
looked
more
frightful
than
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
we
had
rowed
,
or
rather
driven
about
a
league
and
a
half
,
as
we
*NL*
reckoned
it
,
a
raging
wave
,
mountain-like
,
came
rolling
astern
of
us
,
and
*NL*
plainly
bade
us
expect
the
_
coup
de
grace
_
.
It
took
us
with
such
a
fury
,
*NL*
that
it
overset
the
boat
at
once
;
and
separating
us
as
well
from
the
boat
*NL*
as
from
one
another
,
gave
us
no
time
to
say
,
``
O
God
!
''
for
we
were
all
*NL*
swallowed
up
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
can
describe
the
confusion
of
thought
which
I
felt
when
I
sank
*NL*
into
the
water
;
for
though
I
swam
very
well
,
yet
I
could
not
deliver
*NL*
myself
from
the
waves
so
as
to
draw
breath
,
till
that
wave
having
driven
*NL*
me
,
or
rather
carried
me
,
a
vast
way
on
towards
the
shore
,
and
having
*NL*
spent
itself
,
went
back
,
and
left
me
upon
the
land
almost
dry
,
but
half
*NL*
dead
with
the
water
I
took
in
.
I
had
so
much
presence
of
mind
,
as
well
*NL*
as
breath
left
,
that
seeing
myself
nearer
the
mainland
than
I
expected
,
I
*NL*
got
upon
my
feet
,
and
endeavoured
to
make
on
towards
the
land
as
fast
as
*NL*
I
could
before
another
wave
should
return
and
take
me
up
again
;
but
I
*NL*
soon
found
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
it
;
for
I
saw
the
sea
come
after
me
*NL*
as
high
as
a
great
hill
,
and
as
furious
as
an
enemy
,
which
I
had
no
means
*NL*
or
strength
to
contend
with
:
my
business
was
to
hold
my
breath
,
and
raise
*NL*
myself
upon
the
water
if
I
could
;
and
so
,
by
swimming
,
to
preserve
my
*NL*
breathing
,
and
pilot
myself
towards
the
shore
,
if
possible
,
my
greatest
*NL*
concern
now
being
that
the
sea
,
as
it
would
carry
me
a
great
way
towards
*NL*
the
shore
when
it
came
on
,
might
not
carry
me
back
again
with
it
when
it
*NL*
gave
back
towards
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wave
that
came
upon
me
again
buried
me
at
once
twenty
or
thirty
feet
*NL*
deep
in
its
own
body
,
and
I
could
feel
myself
carried
with
a
mighty
force
*NL*
and
swiftness
towards
the
shore
--
a
very
great
way
;
but
I
held
my
breath
,
*NL*
and
assisted
myself
to
swim
still
forward
with
all
my
might
.
I
was
ready
*NL*
to
burst
with
holding
my
breath
,
when
,
as
I
felt
myself
rising
up
,
so
,
to
*NL*
my
immediate
relief
,
I
found
my
head
and
hands
shoot
out
above
the
*NL*
surface
of
the
water
;
and
though
it
was
not
two
seconds
of
time
that
I
*NL*
could
keep
myself
so
,
yet
it
relieved
me
greatly
,
gave
me
breath
,
and
new
*NL*
courage
.
I
was
covered
again
with
water
a
good
while
,
but
not
so
long
*NL*
but
I
held
it
out
;
and
finding
the
water
had
spent
itself
,
and
began
to
*NL*
return
,
I
struck
forward
against
the
return
of
the
waves
,
and
felt
ground
*NL*
again
with
my
feet
.
I
stood
still
a
few
moments
to
recover
breath
,
and
*NL*
till
the
waters
went
from
me
,
and
then
took
to
my
heels
and
ran
with
what
*NL*
strength
I
had
further
towards
the
shore
.
But
neither
would
this
deliver
*NL*
me
from
the
fury
of
the
sea
,
which
came
pouring
in
after
me
again
;
and
*NL*
twice
more
I
was
lifted
up
by
the
waves
and
carried
forward
as
before
,
*NL*
the
shore
being
very
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
time
of
these
two
had
well-nigh
been
fatal
to
me
,
for
the
sea
*NL*
having
hurried
me
along
as
before
,
landed
me
,
or
rather
dashed
me
,
*NL*
against
a
piece
of
rock
,
and
that
with
such
force
,
that
it
left
me
*NL*
senseless
,
and
indeed
helpless
,
as
to
my
own
deliverance
;
for
the
blow
*NL*
taking
my
side
and
breast
,
beat
the
breath
as
it
were
quite
out
of
my
*NL*
body
;
and
had
it
returned
again
immediately
,
I
must
have
been
strangled
*NL*
in
the
water
;
but
I
recovered
a
little
before
the
return
of
the
waves
,
*NL*
and
seeing
I
should
be
covered
again
with
the
water
,
I
resolved
to
hold
*NL*
fast
by
a
piece
of
the
rock
,
and
so
to
hold
my
breath
,
if
possible
,
till
*NL*
the
wave
went
back
.
Now
,
as
the
waves
were
not
so
high
as
at
first
,
*NL*
being
nearer
land
,
I
held
my
hold
till
the
wave
abated
,
and
then
fetched
*NL*
another
run
,
which
brought
me
so
near
the
shore
that
the
next
wave
,
*NL*
though
it
went
over
me
,
yet
did
not
so
swallow
me
up
as
to
carry
me
away
;
*NL*
and
the
next
run
I
took
,
I
got
to
the
mainland
,
where
,
to
my
great
*NL*
comfort
,
I
clambered
up
the
cliffs
of
the
shore
and
sat
me
down
upon
the
*NL*
grass
,
free
from
danger
and
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
landed
and
safe
on
shore
,
and
began
to
look
up
and
thank
God
*NL*
that
my
life
was
saved
,
in
a
case
wherein
there
was
some
minutes
before
*NL*
scarce
any
room
to
hope
.
I
believe
it
is
impossible
to
express
,
to
the
*NL*
life
,
what
the
ecstasies
and
transports
of
the
soul
are
,
when
it
is
so
*NL*
saved
,
as
I
may
say
,
out
of
the
very
grave
:
and
I
do
not
wonder
now
at
*NL*
the
custom
,
when
a
malefactor
,
who
has
the
halter
about
his
neck
,
is
tied
*NL*
up
,
and
just
going
to
be
turned
off
,
and
has
a
reprieve
brought
to
him
--
I
*NL*
say
,
I
do
not
wonder
that
they
bring
a
surgeon
with
it
,
to
let
him
blood
*NL*
that
very
moment
they
tell
him
of
it
,
that
the
surprise
may
not
drive
the
*NL*
animal
spirits
from
the
heart
and
overwhelm
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
sudden
joys
,
like
griefs
,
confound
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
about
on
the
shore
lifting
up
my
hands
,
and
my
whole
being
,
as
I
*NL*
may
say
,
wrapped
up
in
a
contemplation
of
my
deliverance
;
making
a
*NL*
thousand
gestures
and
motions
,
which
I
can
not
describe
;
reflecting
upon
*NL*
all
my
comrades
that
were
drowned
,
and
that
there
should
not
be
one
soul
*NL*
saved
but
myself
;
for
,
as
for
them
,
I
never
saw
them
afterwards
,
or
any
*NL*
sign
of
them
,
except
three
of
their
hats
,
one
cap
,
and
two
shoes
that
*NL*
were
not
fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
cast
my
eye
to
the
stranded
vessel
,
when
,
the
breach
and
froth
of
the
*NL*
sea
being
so
big
,
I
could
hardly
see
it
,
it
lay
so
far
of
;
and
*NL*
considered
,
Lord
!
how
was
it
possible
I
could
get
on
shore
?
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
solaced
my
mind
with
the
comfortable
part
of
my
condition
,
I
*NL*
began
to
look
round
me
,
to
see
what
kind
of
place
I
was
in
,
and
what
was
*NL*
next
to
be
done
;
and
I
soon
found
my
comforts
abate
,
and
that
,
in
a
word
,
*NL*
I
had
a
dreadful
deliverance
;
for
I
was
wet
,
had
no
clothes
to
shift
me
,
*NL*
nor
anything
either
to
eat
or
drink
to
comfort
me
;
neither
did
I
see
any
*NL*
prospect
before
me
but
that
of
perishing
with
hunger
or
being
devoured
by
*NL*
wild
beasts
;
and
that
which
was
particularly
afflicting
to
me
was
,
that
I
*NL*
had
no
weapon
,
either
to
hunt
and
kill
any
creature
for
my
sustenance
,
or
*NL*
to
defend
myself
against
any
other
creature
that
might
desire
to
kill
me
*NL*
for
theirs
.
In
a
word
,
I
had
nothing
about
me
but
a
knife
,
a
*NL*
tobacco-pipe
,
and
a
little
tobacco
in
a
box
.
This
was
all
my
provisions
;
*NL*
and
this
threw
me
into
such
terrible
agonies
of
mind
,
that
for
a
while
I
*NL*
ran
about
like
a
madman
.
Night
coming
upon
me
,
I
began
with
a
heavy
*NL*
heart
to
consider
what
would
be
my
lot
if
there
were
any
ravenous
beasts
*NL*
in
that
country
,
as
at
night
they
always
come
abroad
for
their
prey
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
remedy
that
offered
to
my
thoughts
at
that
time
was
to
get
up
*NL*
into
a
thick
bushy
tree
like
a
fir
,
but
thorny
,
which
grew
near
me
,
and
*NL*
where
I
resolved
to
sit
all
night
,
and
consider
the
next
day
what
death
I
*NL*
should
die
,
for
as
yet
I
saw
no
prospect
of
life
.
I
walked
about
a
*NL*
furlong
from
the
shore
,
to
see
if
I
could
find
any
fresh
water
to
drink
,
*NL*
which
I
did
,
to
my
great
joy
;
and
having
drank
,
and
put
a
little
tobacco
*NL*
into
my
mouth
to
prevent
hunger
,
I
went
to
the
tree
,
and
getting
up
into
*NL*
it
,
endeavoured
to
place
myself
so
that
if
I
should
sleep
I
might
not
*NL*
fall
.
And
having
cut
me
a
short
stick
,
like
a
truncheon
,
for
my
defence
,
*NL*
I
took
up
my
lodging
;
and
having
been
excessively
fatigued
,
I
fell
fast
*NL*
asleep
,
and
slept
as
comfortably
as
,
I
believe
,
few
could
have
done
in
my
*NL*
condition
,
and
found
myself
more
refreshed
with
it
than
,
I
think
,
I
ever
*NL*
was
on
such
an
occasion
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
FIRST
WEEKS
ON
THE
ISLAND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
waked
it
was
broad
day
,
the
weather
clear
,
and
the
storm
abated
,
*NL*
so
that
the
sea
did
not
rage
and
swell
as
before
.
But
that
which
*NL*
surprised
me
most
was
,
that
the
ship
was
lifted
off
in
the
night
from
the
*NL*
sand
where
she
lay
by
the
swelling
of
the
tide
,
and
was
driven
up
almost
*NL*
as
far
as
the
rock
which
I
at
first
mentioned
,
where
I
had
been
so
*NL*
bruised
by
the
wave
dashing
me
against
it
.
This
being
within
about
a
*NL*
mile
from
the
shore
where
I
was
,
and
the
ship
seeming
to
stand
upright
*NL*
still
,
I
wished
myself
on
board
,
that
at
least
I
might
save
some
*NL*
necessary
things
for
my
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
down
from
my
apartment
in
the
tree
,
I
looked
about
me
again
,
*NL*
and
the
first
thing
I
found
was
the
boat
,
which
lay
,
as
the
wind
and
the
*NL*
sea
had
tossed
her
up
,
upon
the
land
,
about
two
miles
on
my
right
hand
.
*NL*
I
walked
as
far
as
I
could
upon
the
shore
to
have
got
to
her
;
but
found
a
*NL*
neck
or
inlet
of
water
between
me
and
the
boat
which
was
about
half
a
*NL*
mile
broad
;
so
I
came
back
for
the
present
,
being
more
intent
upon
*NL*
getting
at
the
ship
,
where
I
hoped
to
find
something
for
my
present
*NL*
subsistence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
after
noon
I
found
the
sea
very
calm
,
and
the
tide
ebbed
so
far
*NL*
out
that
I
could
come
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
ship
.
And
here
I
*NL*
found
a
fresh
renewing
of
my
grief
;
for
I
saw
evidently
that
if
we
had
*NL*
kept
on
board
we
had
been
all
safe
--
that
is
to
say
,
we
had
all
got
safe
*NL*
on
shore
,
and
I
had
not
been
so
miserable
as
to
be
left
entirety
*NL*
destitute
of
all
comfort
and
company
as
I
now
was
.
This
forced
tears
to
*NL*
my
eyes
again
;
but
as
there
was
little
relief
in
that
,
I
resolved
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
to
get
to
the
ship
;
so
I
pulled
off
my
clothes
--
for
the
weather
*NL*
was
hot
to
extremity
--
and
took
the
water
.
But
when
I
came
to
the
ship
my
*NL*
difficulty
was
still
greater
to
know
how
to
get
on
board
;
for
,
as
she
lay
*NL*
aground
,
and
high
out
of
the
water
,
there
was
nothing
within
my
reach
to
*NL*
lay
hold
of
.
I
swam
round
her
twice
,
and
the
second
time
I
spied
a
small
*NL*
piece
of
rope
,
which
I
wondered
I
did
not
see
at
first
,
hung
down
by
the
*NL*
fore-chains
so
low
,
as
that
with
great
difficulty
I
got
hold
of
it
,
and
*NL*
by
the
help
of
that
rope
I
got
up
into
the
forecastle
of
the
ship
.
Here
*NL*
I
found
that
the
ship
was
bulged
,
and
had
a
great
deal
of
water
in
her
*NL*
hold
,
but
that
she
lay
so
on
the
side
of
a
bank
of
hard
sand
,
or
,
rather
*NL*
earth
,
that
her
stern
lay
lifted
up
upon
the
bank
,
and
her
head
low
,
*NL*
almost
to
the
water
.
By
this
means
all
her
quarter
was
free
,
and
all
*NL*
that
was
in
that
part
was
dry
;
for
you
may
be
sure
my
first
work
was
to
*NL*
search
,
and
to
see
what
was
spoiled
and
what
was
free
.
And
,
first
,
I
*NL*
found
that
all
the
ship
's
provisions
were
dry
and
untouched
by
the
water
,
*NL*
and
being
very
well
disposed
to
eat
,
I
went
to
the
bread
room
and
filled
*NL*
my
pockets
with
biscuit
,
and
ate
it
as
I
went
about
other
things
,
for
I
*NL*
had
no
time
to
lose
.
I
also
found
some
rum
in
the
great
cabin
,
of
which
*NL*
I
took
a
large
dram
,
and
which
I
had
,
indeed
,
need
enough
of
to
spirit
me
*NL*
for
what
was
before
me
.
Now
I
wanted
nothing
but
a
boat
to
furnish
*NL*
myself
with
many
things
which
I
foresaw
would
be
very
necessary
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
to
sit
still
and
wish
for
what
was
not
to
be
had
;
and
this
*NL*
extremity
roused
my
application
.
We
had
several
spare
yards
,
and
two
or
*NL*
three
large
spars
of
wood
,
and
a
spare
topmast
or
two
in
the
ship
;
I
*NL*
resolved
to
fall
to
work
with
these
,
and
I
flung
as
many
of
them
*NL*
overboard
as
I
could
manage
for
their
weight
,
tying
every
one
with
a
*NL*
rope
,
that
they
might
not
drive
away
.
When
this
was
done
I
went
down
the
*NL*
ship
's
side
,
and
pulling
them
to
me
,
I
tied
four
of
them
together
at
both
*NL*
ends
as
well
as
I
could
,
in
the
form
of
a
raft
,
and
laying
two
or
three
*NL*
short
pieces
of
plank
upon
them
crossways
,
I
found
I
could
walk
upon
it
*NL*
very
well
,
but
that
it
was
not
able
to
bear
any
great
weight
,
the
pieces
*NL*
being
too
light
.
So
I
went
to
work
,
and
with
a
carpenter
's
saw
I
cut
a
*NL*
spare
topmast
into
three
lengths
,
and
added
them
to
my
raft
,
with
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
labour
and
pains
.
But
the
hope
of
furnishing
myself
with
*NL*
necessaries
encouraged
me
to
go
beyond
what
I
should
have
been
able
to
*NL*
have
done
upon
another
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
raft
was
now
strong
enough
to
bear
any
reasonable
weight
.
My
next
*NL*
care
was
what
to
load
it
with
,
and
how
to
preserve
what
I
laid
upon
it
*NL*
from
the
surf
of
the
sea
;
but
I
was
not
long
considering
this
.
I
first
*NL*
laid
all
the
planks
or
boards
upon
it
that
I
could
get
,
and
having
*NL*
considered
well
what
I
most
wanted
,
I
got
three
of
the
seamen
's
chests
,
*NL*
which
I
had
broken
open
,
and
emptied
,
and
lowered
them
down
upon
my
raft
;
*NL*
the
first
of
these
I
filled
with
provisions
--
viz
.
bread
,
rice
,
three
*NL*
Dutch
cheeses
,
five
pieces
of
dried
goat
's
flesh
-LRB-
which
we
lived
much
*NL*
upon
-RRB-
,
and
a
little
remainder
of
European
corn
,
which
had
been
laid
by
*NL*
for
some
fowls
which
we
brought
to
sea
with
us
,
but
the
fowls
were
*NL*
killed
.
There
had
been
some
barley
and
wheat
together
;
but
,
to
my
great
*NL*
disappointment
,
I
found
afterwards
that
the
rats
had
eaten
or
spoiled
it
*NL*
all
.
As
for
liquors
,
I
found
several
,
cases
of
bottles
belonging
to
our
*NL*
skipper
,
in
which
were
some
cordial
waters
;
and
,
in
all
,
about
five
or
*NL*
six
gallons
of
rack
.
These
I
stowed
by
themselves
,
there
being
no
need
*NL*
to
put
them
into
the
chest
,
nor
any
room
for
them
.
While
I
was
doing
*NL*
this
,
I
found
the
tide
begin
to
flow
,
though
very
calm
;
and
I
had
the
*NL*
mortification
to
see
my
coat
,
shirt
,
and
waistcoat
,
which
I
had
left
on
*NL*
the
shore
,
upon
the
sand
,
swim
away
.
As
for
my
breeches
,
which
were
only
*NL*
linen
,
and
open-kneed
,
I
swam
on
board
in
them
and
my
stockings
.
*NL*
However
,
this
set
me
on
rummaging
for
clothes
,
of
which
I
found
enough
,
*NL*
but
took
no
more
than
I
wanted
for
present
use
,
for
I
had
others
things
*NL*
which
my
eye
was
more
upon
--
as
,
first
,
tools
to
work
with
on
shore
.
And
*NL*
it
was
after
long
searching
that
I
found
out
the
carpenter
's
chest
,
which
*NL*
was
,
indeed
,
a
very
useful
prize
to
me
,
and
much
more
valuable
than
a
*NL*
shipload
of
gold
would
have
been
at
that
time
.
I
got
it
down
to
my
raft
,
*NL*
whole
as
it
was
,
without
losing
time
to
look
into
it
,
for
I
knew
in
*NL*
general
what
it
contained
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
next
care
was
for
some
ammunition
and
arms
.
There
were
two
very
good
*NL*
fowling-pieces
in
the
great
cabin
,
and
two
pistols
.
These
I
secured
*NL*
first
,
with
some
powder-horns
and
a
small
bag
of
shot
,
and
two
old
rusty
*NL*
swords
.
I
knew
there
were
three
barrels
of
powder
in
the
ship
,
but
knew
*NL*
not
where
our
gunner
had
stowed
them
;
but
with
much
search
I
found
them
,
*NL*
two
of
them
dry
and
good
,
the
third
had
taken
water
.
Those
two
I
got
to
*NL*
my
raft
with
the
arms
.
And
now
I
thought
myself
pretty
well
freighted
,
*NL*
and
began
to
think
how
I
should
get
to
shore
with
them
,
having
neither
*NL*
sail
,
oar
,
nor
rudder
;
and
the
least
capful
of
wind
would
have
overset
*NL*
all
my
navigation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
three
encouragements
--
1st
,
a
smooth
,
calm
sea
;
2ndly
,
the
tide
*NL*
rising
,
and
setting
in
to
the
shore
;
3rdly
,
what
little
wind
there
was
*NL*
blew
me
towards
the
land
.
And
thus
,
having
found
two
or
three
broken
*NL*
oars
belonging
to
the
boat
--
and
,
besides
the
tools
which
were
in
the
*NL*
chest
,
I
found
two
saws
,
an
axe
,
and
a
hammer
;
with
this
cargo
I
put
to
*NL*
sea
.
For
a
mile
or
thereabouts
my
raft
went
very
well
,
only
that
I
found
*NL*
it
drive
a
little
distant
from
the
place
where
I
had
landed
before
;
by
*NL*
which
I
perceived
that
there
was
some
indraft
of
the
water
,
and
*NL*
consequently
I
hoped
to
find
some
creek
or
river
there
,
which
I
might
*NL*
make
use
of
as
a
port
to
get
to
land
with
my
cargo
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
imagined
,
so
it
was
.
There
appeared
before
me
a
little
opening
of
*NL*
the
land
,
and
I
found
a
strong
current
of
the
tide
set
into
it
;
so
I
*NL*
guided
my
raft
as
well
as
I
could
,
to
keep
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
I
had
like
to
have
suffered
a
second
shipwreck
,
which
,
if
I
had
,
*NL*
I
think
verily
would
have
broken
my
heart
;
for
,
knowing
nothing
of
the
*NL*
coast
,
my
raft
ran
aground
at
one
end
of
it
upon
a
shoal
,
and
not
being
*NL*
aground
at
the
other
end
,
it
wanted
but
a
little
that
all
my
cargo
had
*NL*
slipped
off
towards
the
end
that
was
afloat
,
and
to
fallen
into
the
*NL*
water
.
I
did
my
utmost
,
by
setting
my
back
against
the
chests
,
to
keep
*NL*
them
in
their
places
,
but
could
not
thrust
off
the
raft
with
all
my
*NL*
strength
;
neither
durst
I
stir
from
the
posture
I
was
in
;
but
holding
up
*NL*
the
chests
with
all
my
might
,
I
stood
in
that
manner
near
half-an-hour
,
*NL*
in
which
time
the
rising
of
the
water
brought
me
a
little
more
upon
a
*NL*
level
;
and
a
little
after
,
the
water
still-rising
,
my
raft
floated
again
,
*NL*
and
I
thrust
her
off
with
the
oar
I
had
into
the
channel
,
and
then
*NL*
driving
up
higher
,
I
at
length
found
myself
in
the
mouth
of
a
little
*NL*
river
,
with
land
on
both
sides
,
and
a
strong
current
of
tide
running
up
.
*NL*
I
looked
on
both
sides
for
a
proper
place
to
get
to
shore
,
for
I
was
not
*NL*
willing
to
be
driven
too
high
up
the
river
:
hoping
in
time
to
see
some
*NL*
ships
at
sea
,
and
therefore
resolved
to
place
myself
as
near
the
coast
as
*NL*
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
I
spied
a
little
cove
on
the
right
shore
of
the
creek
,
to
which
*NL*
with
great
pain
and
difficulty
I
guided
my
raft
,
and
at
last
got
so
near
*NL*
that
,
reaching
ground
with
my
oar
,
I
could
thrust
her
directly
in
.
But
*NL*
here
I
had
like
to
have
dipped
all
my
cargo
into
the
sea
again
;
for
that
*NL*
shore
lying
pretty
steep
--
that
is
to
say
sloping
--
there
was
no
place
to
*NL*
land
,
but
where
one
end
of
my
float
,
if
it
ran
on
shore
,
would
lie
so
*NL*
high
,
and
the
other
sink
lower
,
as
before
,
that
it
would
endanger
my
*NL*
cargo
again
.
All
that
I
could
do
was
to
wait
till
the
tide
was
at
the
*NL*
highest
,
keeping
the
raft
with
my
oar
like
an
anchor
,
to
hold
the
side
of
*NL*
it
fast
to
the
shore
,
near
a
flat
piece
of
ground
,
which
I
expected
the
*NL*
water
would
flow
over
;
and
so
it
did
.
As
soon
as
I
found
water
*NL*
enough
--
for
my
raft
drew
about
a
foot
of
water
--
I
thrust
her
upon
that
*NL*
flat
piece
of
ground
,
and
there
fastened
or
moored
her
,
by
sticking
my
*NL*
two
broken
oars
into
the
ground
,
one
on
one
side
near
one
end
,
and
one
on
*NL*
the
other
side
near
the
other
end
;
and
thus
I
lay
till
the
water
ebbed
*NL*
away
,
and
left
my
raft
and
all
my
cargo
safe
on
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
next
work
was
to
view
the
country
,
and
seek
a
proper
place
for
my
*NL*
habitation
,
and
where
to
stow
my
goods
to
secure
them
from
whatever
might
*NL*
happen
.
Where
I
was
,
I
yet
knew
not
;
whether
on
the
continent
or
on
an
*NL*
island
;
whether
inhabited
or
not
inhabited
;
whether
in
danger
of
wild
*NL*
beasts
or
not
.
There
was
a
hill
not
above
a
mile
from
me
,
which
rose
up
*NL*
very
steep
and
high
,
and
which
seemed
to
overtop
some
other
hills
,
which
*NL*
lay
as
in
a
ridge
from
it
northward
.
I
took
out
one
of
the
*NL*
fowling-pieces
,
and
one
of
the
pistols
,
and
a
horn
of
powder
;
and
thus
*NL*
armed
,
I
travelled
for
discovery
up
to
the
top
of
that
hill
,
where
,
after
*NL*
I
had
with
great
labour
and
difficulty
got
to
the
top
,
I
saw
my
fate
,
to
*NL*
my
great
affliction
--
viz
.
that
I
was
in
an
island
environed
every
way
*NL*
with
the
sea
:
no
land
to
be
seen
except
some
rocks
,
which
lay
a
great
way
*NL*
off
;
and
two
small
islands
,
less
than
this
,
which
lay
about
three
leagues
*NL*
to
the
west
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
also
that
the
island
I
was
in
was
barren
,
and
,
as
I
saw
good
*NL*
reason
to
believe
,
uninhabited
except
by
wild
beasts
,
of
whom
,
however
,
I
*NL*
saw
none
.
Yet
I
saw
abundance
of
fowls
,
but
knew
not
their
kinds
;
*NL*
neither
when
I
killed
them
could
I
tell
what
was
fit
for
food
,
and
what
*NL*
not
.
At
my
coming
back
,
I
shot
at
a
great
bird
which
I
saw
sitting
upon
*NL*
a
tree
on
the
side
of
a
great
wood
.
I
believe
it
was
the
first
gun
that
*NL*
had
been
fired
there
since
the
creation
of
the
world
.
I
had
no
sooner
*NL*
fired
,
than
from
all
parts
of
the
wood
there
arose
an
innumerable
number
*NL*
of
fowls
,
of
many
sorts
,
making
a
confused
screaming
and
crying
,
and
*NL*
every
one
according
to
his
usual
note
,
but
not
one
of
them
of
any
kind
*NL*
that
I
knew
.
As
for
the
creature
I
killed
,
I
took
it
to
be
a
kind
of
*NL*
hawk
,
its
colour
and
beak
resembling
it
,
but
it
had
no
talons
or
claws
*NL*
more
than
common
.
Its
flesh
was
carrion
,
and
fit
for
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Contented
with
this
discovery
,
I
came
back
to
my
raft
,
and
fell
to
work
*NL*
to
bring
my
cargo
on
shore
,
which
took
me
up
the
rest
of
that
day
.
What
*NL*
to
do
with
myself
at
night
I
knew
not
,
nor
indeed
where
to
rest
,
for
I
*NL*
was
afraid
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
,
not
knowing
but
some
wild
beast
*NL*
might
devour
me
,
though
,
as
I
afterwards
found
,
there
was
really
no
need
*NL*
for
those
fears
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
I
barricaded
myself
round
with
the
chest
and
*NL*
boards
that
I
had
brought
on
shore
,
and
made
a
kind
of
hut
for
that
*NL*
night
's
lodging
.
As
for
food
,
I
yet
saw
not
which
way
to
supply
myself
,
*NL*
except
that
I
had
seen
two
or
three
creatures
like
hares
run
out
of
the
*NL*
wood
where
I
shot
the
fowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
began
to
consider
that
I
might
yet
get
a
great
many
things
out
of
*NL*
the
ship
which
would
be
useful
to
me
,
and
particularly
some
of
the
*NL*
rigging
and
sails
,
and
such
other
things
as
might
come
to
land
;
and
I
*NL*
resolved
to
make
another
voyage
on
board
the
vessel
,
if
possible
.
And
as
*NL*
I
knew
that
the
first
storm
that
blew
must
necessarily
break
her
all
in
*NL*
pieces
,
I
resolved
to
set
all
other
things
apart
till
I
had
got
*NL*
everything
out
of
the
ship
that
I
could
get
.
Then
I
called
a
*NL*
council
--
that
is
to
say
in
my
thoughts
--
whether
I
should
take
back
the
*NL*
raft
;
but
this
appeared
impracticable
:
so
I
resolved
to
go
as
before
,
*NL*
when
the
tide
was
down
;
and
I
did
so
,
only
that
I
stripped
before
I
went
*NL*
from
my
hut
,
having
nothing
on
but
my
chequered
shirt
,
a
pair
of
linen
*NL*
drawers
,
and
a
pair
of
pumps
on
my
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
on
board
the
ship
as
before
,
and
prepared
a
second
raft
;
and
,
*NL*
having
had
experience
of
the
first
,
I
neither
made
this
so
unwieldy
,
nor
*NL*
loaded
it
so
hard
,
but
yet
I
brought
away
several
things
very
useful
to
*NL*
me
;
as
first
,
in
the
carpenters
stores
I
found
two
or
three
bags
full
of
*NL*
nails
and
spikes
,
a
great
screw-jack
,
a
dozen
or
two
of
hatchets
,
and
,
*NL*
above
all
,
that
most
useful
thing
called
a
grindstone
.
All
these
I
*NL*
secured
,
together
with
several
things
belonging
to
the
gunner
,
*NL*
particularly
two
or
three
iron
crows
,
and
two
barrels
of
musket
bullets
,
*NL*
seven
muskets
,
another
fowling-piece
,
with
some
small
quantity
of
powder
*NL*
more
;
a
large
bagful
of
small
shot
,
and
a
great
roll
of
sheet-lead
;
but
*NL*
this
last
was
so
heavy
,
I
could
not
hoist
it
up
to
get
it
over
the
ship
's
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
these
things
,
I
took
all
the
men
's
clothes
that
I
could
find
,
and
*NL*
a
spare
fore-topsail
,
a
hammock
,
and
some
bedding
;
and
with
this
I
loaded
*NL*
my
second
raft
,
and
brought
them
all
safe
on
shore
,
to
my
very
great
*NL*
comfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
under
some
apprehension
,
during
my
absence
from
the
land
,
that
at
*NL*
least
my
provisions
might
be
devoured
on
shore
:
but
when
I
came
back
I
*NL*
found
no
sign
of
any
visitor
;
only
there
sat
a
creature
like
a
wild
cat
*NL*
upon
one
of
the
chests
,
which
,
when
I
came
towards
it
,
ran
away
a
little
*NL*
distance
,
and
then
stood
still
.
She
sat
very
composed
and
unconcerned
,
*NL*
and
looked
full
in
my
face
,
as
if
she
had
a
mind
to
be
acquainted
with
*NL*
me
.
I
presented
my
gun
at
her
,
but
,
as
she
did
not
understand
it
,
she
*NL*
was
perfectly
unconcerned
at
it
,
nor
did
she
offer
to
stir
away
;
upon
*NL*
which
I
tossed
her
a
bit
of
biscuit
,
though
by
the
way
,
I
was
not
very
*NL*
free
of
it
,
for
my
store
was
not
great
:
however
,
I
spared
her
a
bit
,
I
*NL*
say
,
and
she
went
to
it
,
smelled
at
it
,
and
ate
it
,
and
looked
-LRB-
as
if
*NL*
pleased
-RRB-
for
more
;
but
I
thanked
her
,
and
could
spare
no
more
:
so
she
*NL*
marched
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
got
my
second
cargo
on
shore
--
though
I
was
fain
to
open
the
*NL*
barrels
of
powder
,
and
bring
them
by
parcels
,
for
they
were
too
heavy
,
*NL*
being
large
casks
--
I
went
to
work
to
make
me
a
little
tent
with
the
sail
*NL*
and
some
poles
which
I
cut
for
that
purpose
:
and
into
this
tent
I
brought
*NL*
everything
that
I
knew
would
spoil
either
with
rain
or
sun
;
and
I
piled
*NL*
all
the
empty
chests
and
casks
up
in
a
circle
round
the
tent
,
to
fortify
*NL*
it
from
any
sudden
attempt
,
either
from
man
or
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
done
this
,
I
blocked
up
the
door
of
the
tent
with
some
boards
*NL*
within
,
and
an
empty
chest
set
up
on
end
without
;
and
spreading
one
of
*NL*
the
beds
upon
the
ground
,
laying
my
two
pistols
just
at
my
head
,
and
my
*NL*
gun
at
length
by
me
,
I
went
to
bed
for
the
first
time
,
and
slept
very
*NL*
quietly
all
night
,
for
I
was
very
weary
and
heavy
;
for
the
night
before
I
*NL*
had
slept
little
,
and
had
laboured
very
hard
all
day
to
fetch
all
those
*NL*
things
from
the
ship
,
and
to
get
them
on
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
the
biggest
magazine
of
all
kinds
now
that
ever
was
laid
up
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
for
one
man
:
but
I
was
not
satisfied
still
,
for
while
the
ship
*NL*
sat
upright
in
that
posture
,
I
thought
I
ought
to
get
everything
out
of
*NL*
her
that
I
could
;
so
every
day
at
low
water
I
went
on
board
,
and
brought
*NL*
away
something
or
other
;
but
particularly
the
third
time
I
went
I
brought
*NL*
away
as
much
of
the
rigging
as
I
could
,
as
also
all
the
small
ropes
and
*NL*
rope-twine
I
could
get
,
with
a
piece
of
spare
canvas
,
which
was
to
mend
*NL*
the
sails
upon
occasion
,
and
the
barrel
of
wet
gunpowder
.
In
a
word
,
I
*NL*
brought
away
all
the
sails
,
first
and
last
;
only
that
I
was
fain
to
cut
*NL*
them
in
pieces
,
and
bring
as
much
at
a
time
as
I
could
,
for
they
were
no
*NL*
more
useful
to
be
sails
,
but
as
mere
canvas
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
which
comforted
me
more
still
,
was
,
that
last
of
all
,
after
I
*NL*
had
made
five
or
six
such
voyages
as
these
,
and
thought
I
had
nothing
*NL*
more
to
expect
from
the
ship
that
was
worth
my
meddling
with
--
I
say
,
*NL*
after
all
this
,
I
found
a
great
hogshead
of
bread
,
three
large
runlets
of
*NL*
rum
,
or
spirits
,
a
box
of
sugar
,
and
a
barrel
of
fine
flour
;
this
was
*NL*
surprising
to
me
,
because
I
had
given
over
expecting
any
more
provisions
,
*NL*
except
what
was
spoiled
by
the
water
.
I
soon
emptied
the
hogshead
of
the
*NL*
bread
,
and
wrapped
it
up
,
parcel
by
parcel
,
in
pieces
of
the
sails
,
which
*NL*
I
cut
out
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
got
all
this
safe
on
shore
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
I
made
another
voyage
,
and
now
,
having
plundered
the
ship
of
*NL*
what
was
portable
and
fit
to
hand
out
,
I
began
with
the
cables
.
Cutting
*NL*
the
great
cable
into
pieces
,
such
as
I
could
move
,
I
got
two
cables
and
a
*NL*
hawser
on
shore
,
with
all
the
ironwork
I
could
get
;
and
having
cut
down
*NL*
the
spritsail-yard
,
and
the
mizzen-yard
,
and
everything
I
could
,
to
make
*NL*
a
large
raft
,
I
loaded
it
with
all
these
heavy
goods
,
and
came
away
.
But
*NL*
my
good
luck
began
now
to
leave
me
;
for
this
raft
was
so
unwieldy
,
and
so
*NL*
overladen
,
that
,
after
I
had
entered
the
little
cove
where
I
had
landed
*NL*
the
rest
of
my
goods
,
not
being
able
to
guide
it
so
handily
as
I
did
the
*NL*
other
,
it
overset
,
and
threw
me
and
all
my
cargo
into
the
water
.
As
for
*NL*
myself
,
it
was
no
great
harm
,
for
I
was
near
the
shore
;
but
as
to
my
*NL*
cargo
,
it
was
a
great
part
of
it
lost
,
especially
the
iron
,
which
I
*NL*
expected
would
have
been
of
great
use
to
me
;
however
,
when
the
tide
was
*NL*
out
,
I
got
most
of
the
pieces
of
the
cable
ashore
,
and
some
of
the
iron
,
*NL*
though
with
infinite
labour
;
for
I
was
fain
to
dip
for
it
into
the
water
,
*NL*
a
work
which
fatigued
me
very
much
.
After
this
,
I
went
every
day
on
*NL*
board
,
and
brought
away
what
I
could
get
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
now
thirteen
days
on
shore
,
and
had
been
eleven
times
on
board
*NL*
the
ship
,
in
which
time
I
had
brought
away
all
that
one
pair
of
hands
*NL*
could
well
be
supposed
capable
to
bring
;
though
I
believe
verily
,
had
the
*NL*
calm
weather
held
,
I
should
have
brought
away
the
whole
ship
,
piece
by
*NL*
piece
.
But
preparing
the
twelfth
time
to
go
on
board
,
I
found
the
wind
*NL*
began
to
rise
:
however
,
at
low
water
I
went
on
board
,
and
though
I
*NL*
thought
I
had
rummaged
the
cabin
so
effectually
that
nothing
more
could
*NL*
be
found
,
yet
I
discovered
a
locker
with
drawers
in
it
,
in
one
of
which
I
*NL*
found
two
or
three
razors
,
and
one
pair
of
large
scissors
,
with
some
ten
*NL*
or
a
dozen
of
good
knives
and
forks
:
in
another
I
found
about
thirty-six
*NL*
pounds
value
in
money
--
some
European
coin
,
some
Brazil
,
some
pieces
of
*NL*
eight
,
some
gold
,
and
some
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
smiled
to
myself
at
the
sight
of
this
money
:
``
O
drug
!
''
said
I
,
aloud
,
*NL*
``
what
art
thou
good
for
?
Thou
art
not
worth
to
me
--
no
,
not
the
taking
*NL*
off
the
ground
;
one
of
those
knives
is
worth
all
this
heap
;
I
have
no
*NL*
manner
of
use
for
thee
--
e
`
en
remain
where
thou
art
,
and
go
to
the
bottom
*NL*
as
a
creature
whose
life
is
not
worth
saying
.
''
However
,
upon
second
*NL*
thoughts
I
took
it
away
;
and
wrapping
all
this
in
a
piece
of
canvas
,
I
*NL*
began
to
think
of
making
another
raft
;
but
while
I
was
preparing
this
,
I
*NL*
found
the
sky
overcast
,
and
the
wind
began
to
rise
,
and
in
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
it
blew
a
fresh
gale
from
the
shore
.
It
presently
occurred
to
me
*NL*
that
it
was
in
vain
to
pretend
to
make
a
raft
with
the
wind
offshore
;
and
*NL*
that
it
was
my
business
to
be
gone
before
the
tide
of
flood
began
,
*NL*
otherwise
I
might
not
be
able
to
reach
the
shore
at
all
.
Accordingly
,
I
*NL*
let
myself
down
into
the
water
,
and
swam
across
the
channel
,
which
lay
*NL*
between
the
ship
and
the
sands
,
and
even
that
with
difficulty
enough
,
*NL*
partly
with
the
weight
of
the
things
I
had
about
me
,
and
partly
the
*NL*
roughness
of
the
water
;
for
the
wind
rose
very
hastily
,
and
before
it
was
*NL*
quite
high
water
it
blew
a
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
had
got
home
to
my
little
tent
,
where
I
lay
,
with
all
my
wealth
*NL*
about
me
,
very
secure
.
It
blew
very
hard
all
night
,
and
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
when
I
looked
out
,
behold
,
no
more
ship
was
to
be
seen
!
I
was
a
little
*NL*
surprised
,
but
recovered
myself
with
the
satisfactory
reflection
that
I
*NL*
had
lost
no
time
,
nor
abated
any
diligence
,
to
get
everything
out
of
her
*NL*
that
could
be
useful
to
me
;
and
that
,
indeed
,
there
was
little
left
in
*NL*
her
that
I
was
able
to
bring
away
,
if
I
had
had
more
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
gave
over
any
more
thoughts
of
the
ship
,
or
of
anything
out
of
her
,
*NL*
except
what
might
drive
on
shore
from
her
wreck
;
as
,
indeed
,
divers
*NL*
pieces
of
her
afterwards
did
;
but
those
things
were
of
small
use
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
thoughts
were
now
wholly
employed
about
securing
myself
against
either
*NL*
savages
,
if
any
should
appear
,
or
wild
beasts
,
if
any
were
in
the
island
;
*NL*
and
I
had
many
thoughts
of
the
method
how
to
do
this
,
and
what
kind
of
*NL*
dwelling
to
make
--
whether
I
should
make
me
a
cave
in
the
earth
,
or
a
tent
*NL*
upon
the
earth
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
resolved
upon
both
;
the
manner
and
*NL*
description
of
which
,
it
may
not
be
improper
to
give
an
account
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
found
the
place
I
was
in
was
not
fit
for
my
settlement
,
because
it
*NL*
was
upon
a
low
,
moorish
ground
,
near
the
sea
,
and
I
believed
it
would
not
*NL*
be
wholesome
,
and
more
particularly
because
there
was
no
fresh
water
near
*NL*
it
;
so
I
resolved
to
find
a
more
healthy
and
more
convenient
spot
of
*NL*
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
consulted
several
things
in
my
situation
,
which
I
found
would
he
proper
*NL*
for
me
:
1st
,
health
and
fresh
water
,
I
just
now
mentioned
;
2ndly
,
shelter
*NL*
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
;
3rdly
,
security
from
ravenous
creatures
,
*NL*
whether
man
or
beast
;
4thly
,
a
view
to
the
sea
,
that
if
God
sent
any
ship
*NL*
in
sight
,
I
might
not
lose
any
advantage
for
my
deliverance
,
of
which
I
*NL*
was
not
willing
to
banish
all
my
expectation
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
search
of
a
place
proper
for
this
,
I
found
a
little
plain
on
the
side
*NL*
of
a
rising
hill
,
whose
front
towards
this
little
plain
was
steep
as
a
*NL*
house-side
,
so
that
nothing
could
come
down
upon
me
from
the
top
.
On
the
*NL*
one
side
of
the
rock
there
was
a
hollow
place
,
worn
a
little
way
in
,
like
*NL*
the
entrance
or
door
of
a
cave
but
there
was
not
really
any
cave
or
way
*NL*
into
the
rock
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
flat
of
the
green
,
just
before
this
hollow
place
,
I
resolved
to
*NL*
pitch
my
tent
.
This
plain
was
not
above
a
hundred
yards
broad
,
and
about
*NL*
twice
as
long
,
and
lay
like
a
green
before
my
door
;
and
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
it
,
descended
irregularly
every
way
down
into
the
low
ground
by
the
*NL*
seaside
.
It
was
on
the
N.N.W.
side
of
the
hill
;
so
that
it
was
sheltered
*NL*
from
the
heat
every
day
,
till
it
came
to
a
W.
and
by
S.
sun
,
or
*NL*
thereabouts
,
which
,
in
those
countries
,
is
near
the
setting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
set
up
my
tent
I
drew
a
half-circle
before
the
hollow
place
,
*NL*
which
took
in
about
ten
yards
in
its
semi-diameter
from
the
rock
,
and
*NL*
twenty
yards
in
its
diameter
from
its
beginning
and
ending
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
half-circle
I
pitched
two
rows
of
strong
stakes
,
driving
them
*NL*
into
the
ground
till
they
stood
very
firm
like
piles
,
the
biggest
end
*NL*
being
out
of
the
ground
above
five
feet
and
a
half
,
and
sharpened
on
the
*NL*
top
.
The
two
rows
did
not
stand
above
six
inches
from
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
took
the
pieces
of
cable
which
I
had
cut
in
the
ship
,
and
laid
*NL*
them
in
rows
,
one
upon
another
,
within
the
circle
,
between
these
two
rows
*NL*
of
stakes
,
up
to
the
top
,
placing
other
stakes
in
the
inside
,
leaning
*NL*
against
them
,
about
two
feet
and
a
half
high
,
like
a
spur
to
a
post
;
and
*NL*
this
fence
was
so
strong
,
that
neither
man
nor
beast
could
get
into
it
or
*NL*
over
it
.
This
cost
me
a
great
deal
of
time
and
labour
,
especially
to
cut
*NL*
the
piles
in
the
woods
,
bring
them
to
the
place
,
and
drive
them
into
the
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
into
this
place
I
made
to
be
,
not
by
a
door
,
but
by
a
short
*NL*
ladder
to
go
over
the
top
;
which
ladder
,
when
I
was
in
,
I
lifted
over
*NL*
after
me
;
and
so
I
was
completely
fenced
in
and
fortified
,
as
I
thought
,
*NL*
from
all
the
world
,
and
consequently
slept
secure
in
the
night
,
which
*NL*
otherwise
I
could
not
have
done
;
though
,
as
it
appeared
afterwards
,
there
*NL*
was
no
need
of
all
this
caution
from
the
enemies
that
I
apprehended
*NL*
danger
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
this
fence
or
fortress
,
with
infinite
labour
,
I
carried
all
my
*NL*
riches
,
all
my
provisions
,
ammunition
,
and
stores
,
of
which
you
have
the
*NL*
account
above
;
and
I
made
a
large
tent
,
which
to
preserve
me
from
the
*NL*
rains
that
in
one
part
of
the
year
are
very
violent
there
,
I
made
*NL*
double
--
one
smaller
tent
within
,
and
one
larger
tent
above
it
;
and
*NL*
covered
the
uppermost
with
a
large
tarpaulin
,
which
I
had
saved
among
the
*NL*
sails
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
lay
no
more
for
a
while
in
the
bed
which
I
had
brought
on
*NL*
shore
,
but
in
a
hammock
,
which
was
indeed
a
very
good
one
,
and
belonged
*NL*
to
the
mate
of
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
this
tent
I
brought
all
my
provisions
,
and
everything
that
would
*NL*
spoil
by
the
wet
;
and
having
thus
enclosed
all
my
goods
,
I
made
up
the
*NL*
entrance
,
which
till
now
I
had
left
open
,
and
so
passed
and
repassed
,
as
*NL*
I
said
,
by
a
short
ladder
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
done
this
,
I
began
to
work
my
way
into
the
rock
,
and
bringing
*NL*
all
the
earth
and
stones
that
I
dug
down
out
through
my
tent
,
I
laid
them
*NL*
up
within
my
fence
,
in
the
nature
of
a
terrace
,
so
that
it
raised
the
*NL*
ground
within
about
a
foot
and
a
half
;
and
thus
I
made
me
a
cave
,
just
*NL*
behind
my
tent
,
which
served
me
like
a
cellar
to
my
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
cost
me
much
labour
and
many
days
before
all
these
things
were
brought
*NL*
to
perfection
;
and
therefore
I
must
go
back
to
some
other
things
which
*NL*
took
up
some
of
my
thoughts
.
At
the
same
time
it
happened
,
after
I
had
*NL*
laid
my
scheme
for
the
setting
up
my
tent
,
and
making
the
cave
,
that
a
*NL*
storm
of
rain
falling
from
a
thick
,
dark
cloud
,
a
sudden
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
happened
,
and
after
that
a
great
clap
of
thunder
,
as
is
*NL*
naturally
the
effect
of
it
.
I
was
not
so
much
surprised
with
the
*NL*
lightning
as
I
was
with
the
thought
which
darted
into
my
mind
as
swift
as
*NL*
the
lightning
itself
--
Oh
,
my
powder
!
My
very
heart
sank
within
me
when
I
*NL*
thought
that
,
at
one
blast
,
all
my
powder
might
be
destroyed
;
on
which
,
*NL*
not
my
defence
only
,
but
the
providing
my
food
,
as
I
thought
,
entirely
*NL*
depended
.
I
was
nothing
near
so
anxious
about
my
own
danger
,
though
,
had
*NL*
the
powder
took
fire
,
I
should
never
have
known
who
had
hurt
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
impression
did
this
make
upon
me
,
that
after
the
storm
was
over
I
*NL*
laid
aside
all
my
works
,
my
building
and
fortifying
,
and
applied
myself
*NL*
to
make
bags
and
boxes
,
to
separate
the
powder
,
and
to
keep
it
a
little
*NL*
and
a
little
in
a
parcel
,
in
the
hope
that
,
whatever
might
come
,
it
might
*NL*
not
all
take
fire
at
once
;
and
to
keep
it
so
apart
that
it
should
not
be
*NL*
possible
to
make
one
part
fire
another
.
I
finished
this
work
in
about
a
*NL*
fortnight
;
and
I
think
my
powder
,
which
in
all
was
about
two
hundred
and
*NL*
forty
pounds
weight
,
was
divided
in
not
less
than
a
hundred
parcels
.
As
*NL*
to
the
barrel
that
had
been
wet
,
I
did
not
apprehend
any
danger
from
*NL*
that
;
so
I
placed
it
in
my
new
cave
,
which
,
in
my
fancy
,
I
called
my
*NL*
kitchen
;
and
the
rest
I
hid
up
and
down
in
holes
among
the
rocks
,
so
that
*NL*
no
wet
might
come
to
it
,
marking
very
carefully
where
I
laid
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
interval
of
time
while
this
was
doing
,
I
went
out
once
at
least
*NL*
every
day
with
my
gun
,
as
well
to
divert
myself
as
to
see
if
I
could
kill
*NL*
anything
fit
for
food
;
and
,
as
near
as
I
could
,
to
acquaint
myself
with
*NL*
what
the
island
produced
.
The
first
time
I
went
out
,
I
presently
*NL*
discovered
that
there
were
goats
in
the
island
,
which
was
a
great
*NL*
satisfaction
to
me
;
but
then
it
was
attended
with
this
misfortune
to
*NL*
me
--
viz
.
that
they
were
so
shy
,
so
subtle
,
and
so
swift
of
foot
,
that
it
*NL*
was
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
come
at
them
;
but
I
was
not
*NL*
discouraged
at
this
,
not
doubting
but
I
might
now
and
then
shoot
one
,
as
*NL*
it
soon
happened
;
for
after
I
had
found
their
haunts
a
little
,
I
laid
*NL*
wait
in
this
manner
for
them
:
I
observed
if
they
saw
me
in
the
valleys
,
*NL*
though
they
were
upon
the
rocks
,
they
would
run
away
,
as
in
a
terrible
*NL*
fright
;
but
if
they
were
feeding
in
the
valleys
,
and
I
was
upon
the
*NL*
rocks
,
they
took
no
notice
of
me
;
from
whence
I
concluded
that
,
by
the
*NL*
position
of
their
optics
,
their
sight
was
so
directed
downward
that
they
*NL*
did
not
readily
see
objects
that
were
above
them
;
so
afterwards
I
took
*NL*
this
method
--
I
always
climbed
the
rocks
first
,
to
get
above
them
,
and
*NL*
then
had
frequently
a
fair
mark
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
shot
I
made
among
these
creatures
,
I
killed
a
she-goat
,
which
*NL*
had
a
little
kid
by
her
,
which
she
gave
suck
to
,
which
grieved
me
*NL*
heartily
;
for
when
the
old
one
fell
,
the
kid
stood
stock
still
by
her
,
*NL*
till
I
came
and
took
her
up
;
and
not
only
so
,
but
when
I
carried
the
old
*NL*
one
with
me
,
upon
my
shoulders
,
the
kid
followed
me
quite
to
my
*NL*
enclosure
;
upon
which
I
laid
down
the
dam
,
and
took
the
kid
in
my
arms
,
*NL*
and
carried
it
over
my
pale
,
in
hopes
to
have
bred
it
up
tame
;
but
it
*NL*
would
not
eat
;
so
I
was
forced
to
kill
it
and
eat
it
myself
.
These
two
*NL*
supplied
me
with
flesh
a
great
while
,
for
I
ate
sparingly
,
and
saved
my
*NL*
provisions
,
my
bread
especially
,
as
much
as
possibly
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
now
fixed
my
habitation
,
I
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
*NL*
provide
a
place
to
make
a
fire
in
,
and
fuel
to
burn
:
and
what
I
did
for
*NL*
that
,
and
also
how
I
enlarged
my
cave
,
and
what
conveniences
I
made
,
I
*NL*
shall
give
a
full
account
of
in
its
place
;
but
I
must
now
give
some
*NL*
little
account
of
myself
,
and
of
my
thoughts
about
living
,
which
,
it
may
*NL*
well
be
supposed
,
were
not
a
few
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
dismal
prospect
of
my
condition
;
for
as
I
was
not
cast
away
upon
*NL*
that
island
without
being
driven
,
as
is
said
,
by
a
violent
storm
,
quite
*NL*
out
of
the
course
of
our
intended
voyage
,
and
a
great
way
,
viz
.
some
*NL*
hundreds
of
leagues
,
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
the
trade
of
mankind
,
*NL*
I
had
great
reason
to
consider
it
as
a
determination
of
Heaven
,
that
in
*NL*
this
desolate
place
,
and
in
this
desolate
manner
,
I
should
end
my
life
.
*NL*
The
tears
would
run
plentifully
down
my
face
when
I
made
these
*NL*
reflections
;
and
sometimes
I
would
expostulate
with
myself
why
Providence
*NL*
should
thus
completely
ruin
His
creatures
,
and
render
them
so
absolutely
*NL*
miserable
;
so
without
help
,
abandoned
,
so
entirely
depressed
,
that
it
*NL*
could
hardly
be
rational
to
be
thankful
for
such
a
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
something
always
returned
swift
upon
me
to
check
these
thoughts
,
and
*NL*
to
reprove
me
;
and
particularly
one
day
,
walking
with
my
gun
in
my
hand
*NL*
by
the
seaside
,
I
was
very
pensive
upon
the
subject
of
my
present
*NL*
condition
,
when
reason
,
as
it
were
,
expostulated
with
me
the
other
way
,
*NL*
thus
:
``
Well
,
you
are
in
a
desolate
condition
,
it
is
true
;
but
,
pray
*NL*
remember
,
where
are
the
rest
of
you
?
Did
not
you
come
,
eleven
of
you
in
*NL*
the
boat
?
Where
are
the
ten
?
Why
were
they
not
saved
,
and
you
lost
?
*NL*
Why
were
you
singled
out
?
Is
it
better
to
be
here
or
there
?
''
And
then
I
*NL*
pointed
to
the
sea
.
All
evils
are
to
be
considered
with
the
good
that
is
*NL*
in
them
,
and
with
what
worse
attends
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
occurred
to
me
again
,
how
well
I
was
furnished
for
my
*NL*
subsistence
,
and
what
would
have
been
my
case
if
it
had
not
happened
*NL*
-LRB-
which
was
a
hundred
thousand
to
one
-RRB-
that
the
ship
floated
from
the
*NL*
place
where
she
first
struck
,
and
was
driven
so
near
to
the
shore
that
I
*NL*
had
time
to
get
all
these
things
out
of
her
;
what
would
have
been
my
*NL*
case
,
if
I
had
been
forced
to
have
lived
in
the
condition
in
which
I
at
*NL*
first
came
on
shore
,
without
necessaries
of
life
,
or
necessaries
to
*NL*
supply
and
procure
them
?
``
Particularly
,
''
said
I
,
aloud
-LRB-
though
to
*NL*
myself
-RRB-
,
``
what
should
I
have
done
without
a
gun
,
without
ammunition
,
*NL*
without
any
tools
to
make
anything
,
or
to
work
with
,
without
clothes
,
*NL*
bedding
,
a
tent
,
or
any
manner
of
covering
?
''
and
that
now
I
had
all
these
*NL*
to
sufficient
quantity
,
and
was
in
a
fair
way
to
provide
myself
in
such
a
*NL*
manner
as
to
live
without
my
gun
,
when
my
ammunition
was
spent
:
so
that
I
*NL*
had
a
tolerable
view
of
subsisting
,
without
any
want
,
as
long
as
I
lived
;
*NL*
for
I
considered
from
the
beginning
how
I
would
provide
for
the
accidents
*NL*
that
might
happen
,
and
for
the
time
that
was
to
come
,
even
not
only
after
*NL*
my
ammunition
should
be
spent
,
but
even
after
my
health
and
strength
*NL*
should
decay
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
I
had
not
entertained
any
notion
of
my
ammunition
being
*NL*
destroyed
at
one
blast
--
I
mean
my
powder
being
blown
up
by
lightning
;
and
*NL*
this
made
the
thoughts
of
it
so
surprising
to
me
,
when
it
lightened
and
*NL*
thundered
,
as
I
observed
just
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
being
about
to
enter
into
a
melancholy
relation
of
a
scene
of
*NL*
silent
life
,
such
,
perhaps
,
as
was
never
heard
of
in
the
world
before
,
I
*NL*
shall
take
it
from
its
beginning
,
and
continue
it
in
its
order
.
It
was
*NL*
by
my
account
the
30th
of
September
,
when
,
in
the
manner
as
above
said
,
I
*NL*
first
set
foot
upon
this
horrid
island
;
when
the
sun
,
being
to
us
in
its
*NL*
autumnal
equinox
,
was
almost
over
my
head
;
for
I
reckoned
myself
,
by
*NL*
observation
,
to
be
in
the
latitude
of
nine
degrees
twenty-two
minutes
*NL*
north
of
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
been
there
about
ten
or
twelve
days
,
it
came
into
my
thoughts
*NL*
that
I
should
lose
my
reckoning
of
time
for
want
of
books
,
and
pen
and
*NL*
ink
,
and
should
even
forget
the
Sabbath
days
;
but
to
prevent
this
,
I
cut
*NL*
with
my
knife
upon
a
large
post
,
in
capital
letters
--
and
making
it
into
a
*NL*
great
cross
,
I
set
it
up
on
the
shore
where
I
first
landed
--
``
I
came
on
*NL*
shore
here
on
the
30th
September
1659
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
sides
of
this
square
post
I
cut
every
day
a
notch
with
my
knife
,
*NL*
and
every
seventh
notch
was
as
long
again
as
the
rest
,
and
every
first
*NL*
day
of
the
month
as
long
again
as
that
long
one
;
and
thus
I
kept
my
*NL*
calendar
,
or
weekly
,
monthly
,
and
yearly
reckoning
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
next
place
,
we
are
to
observe
that
among
the
many
things
which
I
*NL*
brought
out
of
the
ship
,
in
the
several
voyages
which
,
as
above
*NL*
mentioned
,
I
made
to
it
,
I
got
several
things
of
less
value
,
but
not
at
*NL*
all
less
useful
to
me
,
which
I
omitted
setting
down
before
;
as
,
in
*NL*
particular
,
pens
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
several
parcels
in
the
captain
's
,
*NL*
mate
's
,
gunner
's
and
carpenter
's
keeping
;
three
or
four
compasses
,
some
*NL*
mathematical
instruments
,
dials
,
perspectives
,
charts
,
and
books
of
*NL*
navigation
,
all
which
I
huddled
together
,
whether
I
might
want
them
or
*NL*
no
;
also
,
I
found
three
very
good
Bibles
,
which
came
to
me
in
my
cargo
*NL*
from
England
,
and
which
I
had
packed
up
among
my
things
;
some
Portuguese
*NL*
books
also
;
and
among
them
two
or
three
Popish
prayer-books
,
and
several
*NL*
other
books
,
all
which
I
carefully
secured
.
And
I
must
not
forget
that
*NL*
we
had
in
the
ship
a
dog
and
two
cats
,
of
whose
eminent
history
I
may
*NL*
have
occasion
to
say
something
in
its
place
;
for
I
carried
both
the
cats
*NL*
with
me
;
and
as
for
the
dog
,
he
jumped
out
of
the
ship
of
himself
,
and
*NL*
swam
on
shore
to
me
the
day
after
I
went
on
shore
with
my
first
cargo
,
*NL*
and
was
a
trusty
servant
to
me
many
years
;
I
wanted
nothing
that
he
could
*NL*
fetch
me
,
nor
any
company
that
he
could
make
up
to
me
;
I
only
wanted
to
*NL*
have
him
talk
to
me
,
but
that
would
not
do
.
As
I
observed
before
,
I
*NL*
found
pens
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
I
husbanded
them
to
the
utmost
;
and
I
*NL*
shall
show
that
while
my
ink
lasted
,
I
kept
things
very
exact
,
but
after
*NL*
that
was
gone
I
could
not
,
for
I
could
not
make
any
ink
by
any
means
that
*NL*
I
could
devise
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
put
me
in
mind
that
I
wanted
many
things
notwithstanding
all
*NL*
that
I
had
amassed
together
;
and
of
these
,
ink
was
one
;
as
also
a
spade
,
*NL*
pickaxe
,
and
shovel
,
to
dig
or
remove
the
earth
;
needles
,
pins
,
and
*NL*
thread
;
as
for
linen
,
I
soon
learned
to
want
that
without
much
*NL*
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
want
of
tools
made
every
work
I
did
go
on
heavily
;
and
it
was
near
a
*NL*
whole
year
before
I
had
entirely
finished
my
little
pale
,
or
surrounded
*NL*
my
habitation
.
The
piles
,
or
stakes
,
which
were
as
heavy
as
I
could
well
*NL*
lift
,
were
a
long
time
in
cutting
and
preparing
in
the
woods
,
and
more
,
*NL*
by
far
,
in
bringing
home
;
so
that
I
spent
sometimes
two
days
in
cutting
*NL*
and
bringing
home
one
of
those
posts
,
and
a
third
day
in
driving
it
into
*NL*
the
ground
;
for
which
purpose
I
got
a
heavy
piece
of
wood
at
first
,
but
*NL*
at
last
bethought
myself
of
one
of
the
iron
crows
;
which
,
however
,
though
*NL*
I
found
it
,
made
driving
those
posts
or
piles
very
laborious
and
tedious
*NL*
work
.
But
what
need
I
have
been
concerned
at
the
tediousness
of
anything
*NL*
I
had
to
do
,
seeing
I
had
time
enough
to
do
it
in
?
nor
had
I
any
other
*NL*
employment
,
if
that
had
been
over
,
at
least
that
I
could
foresee
,
except
*NL*
the
ranging
the
island
to
seek
for
food
,
which
I
did
,
more
or
less
,
every
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
began
to
consider
seriously
my
condition
,
and
the
circumstances
I
*NL*
was
reduced
to
;
and
I
drew
up
the
state
of
my
affairs
in
writing
,
not
so
*NL*
much
to
leave
them
to
any
that
were
to
come
after
me
--
for
I
was
likely
to
*NL*
have
but
few
heirs
--
as
to
deliver
my
thoughts
from
daily
poring
over
*NL*
them
,
and
afflicting
my
mind
;
and
as
my
reason
began
now
to
master
my
*NL*
despondency
,
I
began
to
comfort
myself
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
to
set
the
*NL*
good
against
the
evil
,
that
I
might
have
something
to
distinguish
my
case
*NL*
from
worse
;
and
I
stated
very
impartially
,
like
debtor
and
creditor
,
the
*NL*
comforts
I
enjoyed
against
the
miseries
I
suffered
,
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
_
Evil
_
.
_
Good
_
.
*NL*
I
am
cast
upon
a
horrible
,
But
I
am
alive
;
and
not
drowned
,
*NL*
desolate
island
,
void
of
all
hope
as
all
my
ship
's
company
were
.
*NL*
of
recovery
.
*NL*
I
am
singled
out
and
separated
,
But
I
am
singled
out
,
too
,
from
*NL*
as
it
were
,
from
all
the
world
,
all
the
ship
's
crew
,
to
be
spared
*NL*
to
be
miserable
.
from
death
;
and
He
that
*NL*
miraculously
saved
me
from
death
*NL*
can
deliver
me
from
this
*NL*
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
divided
from
mankind
--
a
But
I
am
not
starved
,
and
*NL*
solitaire
;
one
banished
from
perishing
on
a
barren
place
,
*NL*
human
society
.
affording
no
sustenance
.
*NL*
I
have
no
clothes
to
cover
me
.
But
I
am
in
a
hot
climate
,
where
,
*NL*
if
I
had
clothes
,
I
could
hardly
*NL*
wear
them
.
*NL*
I
am
without
any
defence
,
or
But
I
am
cast
on
an
island
where
*NL*
means
to
resist
any
violence
of
I
see
no
wild
beasts
to
hurt
me
,
*NL*
man
or
beast
.
as
I
saw
on
the
coast
of
Africa
;
*NL*
and
what
if
I
had
been
*NL*
shipwrecked
there
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
no
soul
to
speak
to
or
But
God
wonderfully
sent
the
ship
*NL*
relieve
me
.
in
near
enough
to
the
shore
,
that
*NL*
I
have
got
out
as
many
necessary
*NL*
things
as
will
either
supply
my
*NL*
wants
or
enable
me
to
supply
*NL*
myself
,
even
as
long
as
I
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
whole
,
here
was
an
undoubted
testimony
that
there
was
scarce
any
*NL*
condition
in
the
world
so
miserable
but
there
was
something
negative
or
*NL*
something
positive
to
be
thankful
for
in
it
;
and
let
this
stand
as
a
*NL*
direction
from
the
experience
of
the
most
miserable
of
all
conditions
in
*NL*
this
world
:
that
we
may
always
find
in
it
something
to
comfort
ourselves
*NL*
from
,
and
to
set
,
in
the
description
of
good
and
evil
,
on
the
credit
side
*NL*
of
the
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
now
brought
my
mind
a
little
to
relish
my
condition
,
and
given
*NL*
over
looking
out
to
sea
,
to
see
if
I
could
spy
a
ship
--
I
say
,
giving
over
*NL*
these
things
,
I
began
to
apply
myself
to
arrange
my
way
of
living
,
and
to
*NL*
make
things
as
easy
to
me
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
already
described
my
habitation
,
which
was
a
tent
under
the
side
*NL*
of
a
rock
,
surrounded
with
a
strong
pale
of
posts
and
cables
:
but
I
might
*NL*
now
rather
call
it
a
wall
,
for
I
raised
a
kind
of
wall
up
against
it
of
*NL*
turfs
,
about
two
feet
thick
on
the
outside
;
and
after
some
time
-LRB-
I
think
*NL*
it
was
a
year
and
a
half
-RRB-
I
raised
rafters
from
it
,
leaning
to
the
rock
,
*NL*
and
thatched
or
covered
it
with
boughs
of
trees
,
and
such
things
as
I
*NL*
could
get
,
to
keep
out
the
rain
;
which
I
found
at
some
times
of
the
year
*NL*
very
violent
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
already
observed
how
I
brought
all
my
goods
into
this
pale
,
and
*NL*
into
the
cave
which
I
had
made
behind
me
.
But
I
must
observe
,
too
,
that
*NL*
at
first
this
was
a
confused
heap
of
goods
,
which
,
as
they
lay
in
no
*NL*
order
,
so
they
took
up
all
my
place
;
I
had
no
room
to
turn
myself
:
so
I
*NL*
set
myself
to
enlarge
my
cave
,
and
work
farther
into
the
earth
;
for
it
*NL*
was
a
loose
sandy
rock
,
which
yielded
easily
to
the
labour
I
bestowed
on
*NL*
it
:
and
so
when
I
found
I
was
pretty
safe
as
to
beasts
of
prey
,
I
worked
*NL*
sideways
,
to
the
right
hand
,
into
the
rock
;
and
then
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
right
again
,
worked
quite
out
,
and
made
me
a
door
to
come
out
on
the
*NL*
outside
of
my
pale
or
fortification
.
This
gave
me
not
only
egress
and
*NL*
regress
,
as
it
was
a
back
way
to
my
tent
and
to
my
storehouse
,
but
gave
*NL*
me
room
to
store
my
goods
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
began
to
apply
myself
to
make
such
necessary
things
as
I
found
*NL*
I
most
wanted
,
particularly
a
chair
and
a
table
;
for
without
these
I
was
*NL*
not
able
to
enjoy
the
few
comforts
I
had
in
the
world
;
I
could
not
write
*NL*
or
eat
,
or
do
several
things
,
with
so
much
pleasure
without
a
table
:
so
I
*NL*
went
to
work
.
And
here
I
must
needs
observe
,
that
as
reason
is
the
*NL*
substance
and
origin
of
the
mathematics
,
so
by
stating
and
squaring
*NL*
everything
by
reason
,
and
by
making
the
most
rational
judgment
of
things
,
*NL*
every
man
may
be
,
in
time
,
master
of
every
mechanic
art
.
I
had
never
*NL*
handled
a
tool
in
my
life
;
and
yet
,
in
time
,
by
labour
,
application
,
and
*NL*
contrivance
,
I
found
at
last
that
I
wanted
nothing
but
I
could
have
made
*NL*
it
,
especially
if
I
had
had
tools
.
However
,
I
made
abundance
of
things
,
*NL*
even
without
tools
;
and
some
with
no
more
tools
than
an
adze
and
a
*NL*
hatchet
,
which
perhaps
were
never
made
that
way
before
,
and
that
with
*NL*
infinite
labour
.
For
example
,
if
I
wanted
a
board
,
I
had
no
other
way
*NL*
but
to
cut
down
a
tree
,
set
it
on
an
edge
before
me
,
and
hew
it
flat
on
*NL*
either
side
with
my
axe
,
till
I
brought
it
to
be
thin
as
a
plank
,
and
*NL*
then
dub
it
smooth
with
my
adze
.
It
is
true
,
by
this
method
I
could
make
*NL*
but
one
board
out
of
a
whole
tree
;
but
this
I
had
no
remedy
for
but
*NL*
patience
,
any
more
than
I
had
for
the
prodigious
deal
of
time
and
labour
*NL*
which
it
took
me
up
to
make
a
plank
or
board
:
but
my
time
or
labour
was
*NL*
little
worth
,
and
so
it
was
as
well
employed
one
way
as
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
made
me
a
table
and
a
chair
,
as
I
observed
above
,
in
the
first
*NL*
place
;
and
this
I
did
out
of
the
short
pieces
of
boards
that
I
brought
on
*NL*
my
raft
from
the
ship
.
But
when
I
had
wrought
out
some
boards
as
above
,
*NL*
I
made
large
shelves
,
of
the
breadth
of
a
foot
and
a
half
,
one
over
*NL*
another
all
along
one
side
of
my
cave
,
to
lay
all
my
tools
,
nails
and
*NL*
ironwork
on
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
to
separate
everything
at
large
into
their
*NL*
places
,
that
I
might
come
easily
at
them
.
I
knocked
pieces
into
the
wall
*NL*
of
the
rock
to
hang
my
guns
and
all
things
that
would
hang
up
;
so
that
,
*NL*
had
my
cave
been
to
be
seen
,
it
looked
like
a
general
magazine
of
all
*NL*
necessary
things
;
and
had
everything
so
ready
at
my
hand
,
that
it
was
a
*NL*
great
pleasure
to
me
to
see
all
my
goods
in
such
order
,
and
especially
to
*NL*
find
my
stock
of
all
necessaries
so
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
it
was
that
I
began
to
keep
a
journal
of
every
day
's
employment
;
*NL*
for
,
indeed
,
at
first
I
was
in
too
much
hurry
,
and
not
only
hurry
as
to
*NL*
labour
,
but
in
too
much
discomposure
of
mind
;
and
my
journal
would
have
*NL*
been
full
of
many
dull
things
;
for
example
,
I
must
have
said
thus
:
*NL*
``
30_th
_
.
--
After
I
had
got
to
shore
,
and
escaped
drowning
,
instead
of
*NL*
being
thankful
to
God
for
my
deliverance
,
having
first
vomited
,
with
the
*NL*
great
quantity
of
salt
water
which
had
got
into
my
stomach
,
and
*NL*
recovering
myself
a
little
,
I
ran
about
the
shore
wringing
my
hands
and
*NL*
beating
my
head
and
face
,
exclaiming
at
my
misery
,
and
crying
out
,
'
I
was
*NL*
undone
,
undone
!
'
till
,
tired
and
faint
,
I
was
forced
to
lie
down
on
the
*NL*
ground
to
repose
,
but
durst
not
sleep
for
fear
of
being
devoured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
after
this
,
and
after
I
had
been
on
board
the
ship
,
and
got
all
*NL*
that
I
could
out
of
her
,
yet
I
could
not
forbear
getting
up
to
the
top
of
*NL*
a
little
mountain
and
looking
out
to
sea
,
in
hopes
of
seeing
a
ship
;
then
*NL*
fancy
at
a
vast
distance
I
spied
a
sail
,
please
myself
with
the
hopes
of
*NL*
it
,
and
then
after
looking
steadily
,
till
I
was
almost
blind
,
lose
it
*NL*
quite
,
and
sit
down
and
weep
like
a
child
,
and
thus
increase
my
misery
by
*NL*
my
folly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
having
gotten
over
these
things
in
some
measure
,
and
having
settled
*NL*
my
household
staff
and
habitation
,
made
me
a
table
and
a
chair
,
and
all
*NL*
as
handsome
about
me
as
I
could
,
I
began
to
keep
my
journal
;
of
which
I
*NL*
shall
here
give
you
the
copy
-LRB-
though
in
it
will
be
told
all
these
*NL*
particulars
over
again
-RRB-
as
long
as
it
lasted
;
for
having
no
more
ink
,
I
*NL*
was
forced
to
leave
it
off

September
30
,
1659
.
--
I
,
poor
miserable
Robinson
Crusoe
,
being
shipwrecked
*NL*
during
a
dreadful
storm
in
the
offing
,
came
on
shore
on
this
dismal
,
*NL*
unfortunate
island
,
which
I
called
``
The
Island
of
Despair
''
;
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
ship
's
company
being
drowned
,
and
myself
almost
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
rest
of
the
day
I
spent
in
afflicting
myself
at
the
dismal
*NL*
circumstances
I
was
brought
to
--
viz
.
I
had
neither
food
,
house
,
clothes
,
*NL*
weapon
,
nor
place
to
fly
to
;
and
in
despair
of
any
relief
,
saw
nothing
*NL*
but
death
before
me
--
either
that
I
should
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
,
*NL*
murdered
by
savages
,
or
starved
to
death
for
want
of
food
.
At
the
*NL*
approach
of
night
I
slept
in
a
tree
,
for
fear
of
wild
creatures
;
but
*NL*
slept
soundly
,
though
it
rained
all
night
.

--
In
the
morning
I
saw
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
the
ship
had
*NL*
floated
with
the
high
tide
,
and
was
driven
on
shore
again
much
nearer
the
*NL*
island
;
which
,
as
it
was
some
comfort
,
on
one
hand
--
for
,
seeing
her
set
*NL*
upright
,
and
not
broken
to
pieces
,
I
hoped
,
if
the
wind
abated
,
I
might
*NL*
get
on
board
,
and
get
some
food
and
necessaries
out
of
her
for
my
*NL*
relief
--
so
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
renewed
my
grief
at
the
loss
of
my
*NL*
comrades
,
who
,
I
imagined
,
if
we
had
all
stayed
on
board
,
might
have
*NL*
saved
the
ship
,
or
,
at
least
,
that
they
would
not
have
been
all
drowned
*NL*
as
they
were
;
and
that
,
had
the
men
been
saved
,
we
might
perhaps
have
*NL*
built
us
a
boat
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
ship
to
have
carried
us
to
some
*NL*
other
part
of
the
world
.
I
spent
great
part
of
this
day
in
perplexing
*NL*
myself
on
these
things
;
but
at
length
,
seeing
the
ship
almost
dry
,
I
went
*NL*
upon
the
sand
as
near
as
I
could
,
and
then
swam
on
board
.
This
day
also
*NL*
it
continued
raining
,
though
with
no
wind
at
all
.

All
these
days
entirely
spent
in
*NL*
many
several
voyages
to
get
all
I
could
out
of
the
ship
,
which
I
brought
*NL*
on
shore
every
tide
of
flood
upon
rafts
.
Much
rain
also
in
the
days
,
*NL*
though
with
some
intervals
of
fair
weather
;
but
it
seems
this
was
the
*NL*
rainy
season
.

I
overset
my
raft

and
all
the
goods
I
had
got
upon
it
;
but
,
*NL*
being
in
shoal
water
,
and
the
things
being
chiefly
heavy
,
I
recovered
*NL*
many
of
them
when
the
tide
was
out
.

It
rained
all
night
and
all
day
,
with
some
gusts
of
wind
;
*NL*
during
which
time
the
ship
broke
in
pieces
,
the
wind
blowing
a
little
*NL*
harder
than
before
,
and
was
no
more
to
be
seen
,
except
the
wreck
of
her
,
*NL*
and
that
only
at
low
water
.
I
spent
this
day
in
covering
and
securing
*NL*
the
goods
which
I
had
saved
,
that
the
rain
might
not
spoil
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
_

--
I
walked
about
the
shore
almost
all
day
,
to
find
out
a
place
*NL*
to
fix
my
habitation
,
greatly
concerned
to
secure
myself
from
any
attack
*NL*
in
the
night
,
either
from
wild
beasts
or
men
.
Towards
night
,
I
fixed
*NL*
upon
a
proper
place
,
under
a
rock
,
and
marked
out
a
semicircle
for
my
*NL*
encampment
;
which
I
resolved
to
strengthen
with
a
work
,
wall
,
or
*NL*
fortification
,
made
of
double
piles
,
lined
within
with
cables
,
and
*NL*
without
with
turf
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
26th
to
the
30th
I
worked
very
hard
in
carrying
all
my
goods
to
*NL*
my
new
habitation
,
though
some
part
of
the
time
it
rained
exceedingly
*NL*
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
31st
,
in
the
morning
,
I
went
out
into
the
island
with
my
gun
,
to
seek
*NL*
for
some
food
,
and
discover
the
country
;
when
I
killed
a
she-goat
,
and
*NL*
her
kid
followed
me
home
,
which
I
afterwards
killed
also
,
because
it
*NL*
would
not
feed
.

I
set
up
my
tent
under
a

and
lay
there
for
the
first

night
;
making
it
as
large
as
I
could
,
with
stakes
driven
in
to
swing
my

upon

I
set
up
all
my
chests

boards
,
and
the
pieces
of
timber
*NL*
which
made
my
rafts
,
and
with
them
formed
a
fence
round
me

a
little
*NL*
within
the
place
I
had
marked
out
for
my

I
went
out
with

killed
two
fowls
like
ducks
,
which
*NL*
were
very
good
food
.
In
the
afternoon
went
to
work
to
make
me
a
table
.

This
morning
I
began
to
order
my
times
of
work
,
of
going
out
*NL*
with
my
gun
,
time
of
sleep
,
and
time
of
diversion
--
viz
.
every
morning
I
*NL*
walked
out
with
my
gun
for
two
or
three
hours
,
if
it
did
not
rain
;
then
*NL*
employed
myself
to
work
till
about
eleven
o'clock
;
then
eat
what
I
had
to
*NL*
live
on
;
and
from
twelve
to
two
I
lay
down
to
sleep
,
the
weather
being
*NL*
excessively
hot
;
and
then
,
in
the
evening
,
to
work
again
.
The
working
*NL*
part
of
this
day
and
of
the
next
were
wholly
employed
in
making
my
table
,
*NL*
for
I
was
yet
but
a
very
sorry
workman
,
though
time
and
necessity
made
me
*NL*
a
complete
natural
mechanic
soon
after
,
as
I
believe
they
would
do
any
*NL*
one
else
.

This
day
went
abroad
with
my
gun
and
my
dog
,
and
killed
a
wild
*NL*
cat
;
her
skin
pretty
soft
,
but
her
flesh
good
for
nothing
;
every
creature
*NL*
that
I
killed
I
took
of
the
skins
and
preserved
them
.
Coming
back
by
the
*NL*
sea-shore
,
I
saw
many
sorts
of
sea-fowls
,
which
I
did
not
understand
;
but
*NL*
was
surprised
,
and
almost
frightened
,
with
two
or
three
seals
,
which
,
*NL*
while
I
was
gazing
at
,
not
well
knowing
what
they
were
,
got
into
the
sea
,
*NL*
and
escaped
me
for
that
time
.

After
my
morning
walk
I
went
to
work
with
my
table
again
,
and
*NL*
finished
it
,
though
not
to
my
liking
;
nor
was
it
long
before
I
learned
to

mend
it

and
part
of
the

-LRB-
for
the

was
Sunday
-RRB-
I
took
wholly
up
to
*NL*
make
me
a
chair
,
and
with
much
ado
brought
it
to
a
tolerable
shape
,
but
*NL*
never
to
please
me
;
and
even
in
the
making
I
pulled
it
in
pieces
several
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
_

--
I
soon
neglected
my
keeping
Sundays

for

omitting
my
mark
for

them
on
my
post
,
I
forgot
which
was

This
day
it
rained

which
refreshed
me
exceedingly
,
and
*NL*
cooled
the
earth
;
but
it
was
accompanied
with
terrible
thunder
and
*NL*
lightning
,
which
frightened
me
dreadfully
,
for
fear
of
my
powder
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
it
was
over
,
I
resolved
to
separate
my
stock
of
powder
into
as
*NL*
many
little
parcels
as
possible
,
that
it
might
not
be
in
danger
.

These
three
days
I
spent
in
making
little
square
*NL*
chests
,
or
boxes
,
which
might
hold
about
a
pound
,
or
two
pounds
at
most
,
*NL*
of
powder
;
and
so
,
putting
the
powder
in
,
I
stowed
it
in
places
as
secure
*NL*
and
remote
from
one
another
as
possible
.
On
one
of
these
three
days
I
*NL*
killed
a
large
bird
that
was
good
to
eat
,
but
I
knew
not
what
to
call
it
.

This
day
I
began
to
dig
behind
my
tent
into
the
rock
,
to
make
*NL*
room
for
my
further
conveniency
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Note

Three
things
I
wanted
exceedingly
for
this
work
--
viz
.
a
pickaxe
,
*NL*
a
shovel
,
and
a
wheelbarrow
or
basket
;
so
I
desisted
from
my
work
,
and
*NL*
began
to
consider
how
to
supply
that
want
,
and
make
me
some
tools
.
As
*NL*
for
the
pickaxe
,
I
made
use
of
the
iron
crows
,
which
were
proper
enough
,
*NL*
though
heavy
;
but
the
next
thing
was
a
shovel
or
spade
;
this
was
so
*NL*
absolutely
necessary
,
that
,
indeed
,
I
could
do
nothing
effectually
*NL*
without
it
;
but
what
kind
of
one
to
make
I
knew
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Nov.

.
--
The
next
day
,
in
searching
the
woods
,
I
found
a
tree
of
that
*NL*
wood
,
or
like
it
,
which
in
the
Brazils
they
call
the
iron-tree
,
for
its
*NL*
exceeding
hardness
.
Of
this
,
with
great
labour
,
and
almost
spoiling
my
*NL*
axe
,
I
cut
a
piece
,
and
brought
it
home
,
too
,
with
difficulty
enough
,
for
*NL*
it
was
exceeding
heavy
.
The
excessive
hardness
of
the
wood
,
and
my
*NL*
having
no
other
way
,
made
me
a
long
while
upon
this
machine
,
for
I
worked
*NL*
it
effectually
by
little
and
little
into
the
form
of
a
shovel
or
spade
;
*NL*
the
handle
exactly
shaped
like
ours
in
England
,
only
that
the
board
part
*NL*
having
no
iron
shod
upon
it
at
bottom
,
it
would
not
last
me
so
long
;
*NL*
however
,
it
served
well
enough
for
the
uses
which
I
had
occasion
to
put
*NL*
it
to
;
but
never
was
a
shovel
,
I
believe
,
made
after
that
fashion
,
or
so
*NL*
long
in
making
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
still
deficient
,
for
I
wanted
a
basket
or
a
wheelbarrow
.
A
basket
*NL*
I
could
not
make
by
any
means
,
having
no
such
things
as
twigs
that
would
*NL*
bend
to
make
wicker-ware
--
at
least
,
none
yet
found
out
;
and
as
to
a
*NL*
wheelbarrow
,
I
fancied
I
could
make
all
but
the
wheel
;
but
that
I
had
no
*NL*
notion
of
;
neither
did
I
know
how
to
go
about
it
;
besides
,
I
had
no
*NL*
possible
way
to
make
the
iron
gudgeons
for
the
spindle
or
axis
of
the
*NL*
wheel
to
run
in
;
so
I
gave
it
over
,
and
so
,
for
carrying
away
the
earth
*NL*
which
I
dug
out
of
the
cave
,
I
made
me
a
thing
like
a
hod
which
the
*NL*
labourers
carry
mortar
in
when
they
serve
the
bricklayers
.
This
was
not
*NL*
so
difficult
to
me
as
the
making
the
shovel
:
and
yet
this
and
the
shovel
,
*NL*
and
the
attempt
which
I
made
in
vain
to
make
a
wheelbarrow
,
took
me
up
no
*NL*
less
than
four
days
--
I
mean
always
excepting
my
morning
walk
with
my
gun
,
*NL*
which
I
seldom
failed
,
and
very
seldom
failed
also
bringing
home
*NL*
something
fit
to
eat
.

My
other
work
having
now
stood
still
,
because
of
my
making
*NL*
these
tools
,
when
they
were
finished
I
went
on
,
and
working
every
day
,
as
*NL*
my
strength
and
time
allowed
,
I
spent
eighteen
days
entirely
in
widening
*NL*
and
deepening
my
cave
,
that
it
might
hold
my
goods
commodiously
.

*NL*
_
Note

During
all
this
time
I
worked
to
make
this
room
or
cave
spacious
*NL*
enough
to
accommodate
me
as
a
warehouse
or
magazine
,
a
kitchen
,
a
*NL*
dining-room
,
and
a
cellar
.
As
for
my
lodging
,
I
kept
to
the
tent
;
except
*NL*
that
sometimes
,
in
the
wet
season
of
the
year
,
it
rained
so
hard
that
I
*NL*
could
not
keep
myself
dry
,
which
caused
me
afterwards
to
cover
all
my
*NL*
place
within
my
pale
with
long
poles
,
in
the
form
of
rafters
,
leaning
*NL*
against
the
rock
,
and
load
them
with
flags
and
large
leaves
of
trees
,
*NL*
like
a
thatch

I
began
now
to
think
my
cave
or
vault
finished
,
when
on
a
*NL*
sudden
-LRB-
it
seems
I
had
made
it
too
large
-RRB-
a
great
quantity
of
earth
fell
*NL*
down
from
the
top
on
one
side
;
so
much
that
,
in
short
,
it
frighted
me
,
*NL*
and
not
without
reason
,
too
,
for
if
I
had
been
under
it
,
I
had
never
*NL*
wanted
a
gravedigger
.
I
had
now
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
over
again
,
*NL*
for
I
had
the
loose
earth
to
carry
out
;
and
,
which
was
of
more
*NL*
importance
,
I
had
the
ceiling
to
prop
up
,
so
that
I
might
be
sure
no
more
*NL*
would
come
down
.

shores
or
posts
pitched
upright
to
the
top
,
with
two
pieces
of
boards

across
over
each

this
I
finished
the
next
day
;
and
setting
more
*NL*
posts
up
with
boards
,
in
about
a
week
more
I
had
the
roof
secured
,
and
*NL*
the
posts

standing
in

served
me
for
partitions
to

nails
on
the
posts

to
hang
everything
up

up

set
up
some
pieces

to
order
my

victuals
upon

began

when

the

,
by

it

it
grew
tame

fed

upon

would

Great

so
that
there
was
no

stirring
abroad
,
except
in

Very
hot
still
:
but
I
went
abroad
early
and
late
with
my
*NL*
gun
,
and
lay
still
in
the
middle
of
the
day
.
This
evening
,
going
farther
*NL*
into
the
valleys
which
lay
towards
the
centre
of
the
island
,
I
found
*NL*
there
were
plenty
of
goats
,
though
exceedingly
shy
,
and
hard
to
come
at
;
*NL*
however
,
I
resolved
to
try
if
I
could
not
bring
my
dog
to
hunt
them
down
.

Accordingly
,
the
next
day
I
went
out
with
my
dog
,
and
set
him
*NL*
upon
the
goats
,
but
I
was
mistaken
,
for
they
all
faced
about
upon
the
*NL*
dog
,
and
he
knew
his
danger
too
well
,
for
he
would
not
come
near
them
.

_

--
I
began
my
fence
or
wall
;
which
,
being
still
jealous
of
my
*NL*
being
attacked
by
somebody
,
I
resolved
to
make
very
thick
and
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
N.B.
_
--
This
wall
being
described
before
,
I
purposely
omit
what
was
said
*NL*
in
the
journal
;
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
,
that
I
was
no
less
time
than
*NL*
from
the
2nd
of
January
to
the
14th
of
April
working
,
finishing
,
and
*NL*
perfecting
this
wall
,
though
it
was
no
more
than
about
twenty-four
yards
*NL*
in
length
,
being
a
half-circle
from
one
place
in
the
rock
to
another
*NL*
place
,
about
eight
yards
from
it
,
the
door
of
the
cave
being
in
the
*NL*
centre
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
I
worked
very
hard
,
the
rains
hindering
me
many
days
,
nay
,
*NL*
sometimes
weeks
together
;
but
I
thought
I
should
never
be
perfectly
*NL*
secure
till
this
wall
was
finished
;
and
it
is
scarce
credible
what
*NL*
inexpressible
labour
everything
was
done
with
,
especially
the
bringing
*NL*
piles
out
of
the
woods
and
driving
them
into
the
ground
;
for
I
made
them
*NL*
much
bigger
than
I
needed
to
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
wall
was
finished
,
and
the
outside
double
fenced
,
with
a
turf
*NL*
wall
raised
up
close
to
it
,
I
perceived
myself
that
if
any
people
were
to
*NL*
come
on
shore
there
,
they
would
not
perceive
anything
like
a
habitation
;
*NL*
and
it
was
very
well
I
did
so
,
as
may
be
observed
hereafter
,
upon
a
very
*NL*
remarkable
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
I
made
my
rounds
in
the
woods
for
game
every
day
when
*NL*
the
rain
permitted
me
,
and
made
frequent
discoveries
in
these
walks
of
*NL*
something
or
other
to
my
advantage
;
particularly
,
I
found
a
kind
of
wild
*NL*
pigeons
,
which
build
,
not
as
wood-pigeons
in
a
tree
,
but
rather
as
*NL*
house-pigeons
,
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
;
and
taking
some
young
ones
,
I
*NL*
endeavoured
to
breed
them
up
tame
,
and
did
so
;
but
when
they
grew
older
*NL*
they
flew
away
,
which
perhaps
was
at
first
for
want
of
feeding
them
,
for
*NL*
I
had
nothing
to
give
them
;
however
,
I
frequently
found
their
nests
,
and
*NL*
got
their
young
ones
,
which
were
very
good
meat
.
And
now
,
in
the
*NL*
managing
my
household
affairs
,
I
found
myself
wanting
in
many
things
,
*NL*
which
I
thought
at
first
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
make
;
as
,
indeed
,
*NL*
with
some
of
them
it
was
:
for
instance
,
I
could
never
make
a
cask
to
be
*NL*
hooped
.
I
had
a
small
runlet
or
two
,
as
I
observed
before
;
but
I
could
*NL*
never
arrive
at
the
capacity
of
making
one
by
them
,
though
I
spent
many
*NL*
weeks
about
it
;
I
could
neither
put
in
the
heads
,
or
join
the
staves
so
*NL*
true
to
one
another
as
to
make
them
hold
water
;
so
I
gave
that
also
over
.
*NL*
In
the
next
place
,
I
was
at
a
great
loss
for
candles
;
so
that
as
soon
as
*NL*
ever
it
was
dark
,
which
was
generally
by
seven
o'clock
,
I
was
obliged
to
*NL*
go
to
bed
.
I
remembered
the
lump
of
beeswax
with
which
I
made
candles
in
*NL*
my
African
adventure
;
but
I
had
none
of
that
now
;
the
only
remedy
I
had
*NL*
was
,
that
when
I
had
killed
a
goat
I
saved
the
tallow
,
and
with
a
little
*NL*
dish
made
of
clay
,
which
I
baked
in
the
sun
,
to
which
I
added
a
wick
of
*NL*
some
oakum
,
I
made
me
a
lamp
;
and
this
gave
me
light
,
though
not
a
clear
,
*NL*
steady
light
,
like
a
candle
.
In
the
middle
of
all
my
labours
it
happened
*NL*
that
,
rummaging
my
things
,
I
found
a
little
bag
which
,
as
I
hinted
*NL*
before
,
had
been
filled
with
corn
for
the
feeding
of
poultry
--
not
for
*NL*
this
voyage
,
but
before
,
as
I
suppose
,
when
the
ship
came
from
Lisbon
.
*NL*
The
little
remainder
of
corn
that
had
been
in
the
bag
was
all
devoured
by
*NL*
the
rats
,
and
I
saw
nothing
in
the
bag
but
husks
and
dust
;
and
being
*NL*
willing
to
have
the
bag
for
some
other
use
-LRB-
I
think
it
was
to
put
powder
*NL*
in
,
when
I
divided
it
for
fear
of
the
lightning
,
or
some
such
use
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
shook
the
husks
of
corn
out
of
it
on
one
side
of
my
fortification
,
under
*NL*
the
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
little
before
the
great
rains
just
now
mentioned
that
I
threw
*NL*
this
stuff
away
,
taking
no
notice
,
and
not
so
much
as
remembering
that
I
*NL*
had
thrown
anything
there
,
when
,
about
a
month
after
,
or
thereabouts
,
I
*NL*
saw
some
few
stalks
of
something
green
shooting
out
of
the
ground
,
which
*NL*
I
fancied
might
be
some
plant
I
had
not
seen
;
but
I
was
surprised
,
and
*NL*
perfectly
astonished
,
when
,
after
a
little
longer
time
,
I
saw
about
ten
*NL*
or
twelve
ears
come
out
,
which
were
perfect
green
barley
,
of
the
same
*NL*
kind
as
our
European
--
nay
,
as
our
English
barley
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
express
the
astonishment
and
confusion
of
my
thoughts
*NL*
on
this
occasion
.
I
had
hitherto
acted
upon
no
religious
foundation
at
*NL*
all
;
indeed
,
I
had
very
few
notions
of
religion
in
my
head
,
nor
had
*NL*
entertained
any
sense
of
anything
that
had
befallen
me
otherwise
than
as
*NL*
chance
,
or
,
as
we
lightly
say
,
what
pleases
God
,
without
so
much
as
*NL*
inquiring
into
the
end
of
Providence
in
these
things
,
or
His
order
in
*NL*
governing
events
for
the
world
.
But
after
I
saw
barley
grow
there
,
in
a
*NL*
climate
which
I
knew
was
not
proper
for
corn
,
and
especially
that
I
knew
*NL*
not
how
it
came
there
,
it
startled
me
strangely
,
and
I
began
to
suggest
*NL*
that
God
had
miraculously
caused
His
grain
to
grow
without
any
help
of
*NL*
seed
sown
,
and
that
it
was
so
directed
purely
for
my
sustenance
on
that
*NL*
wild
,
miserable
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
touched
my
heart
a
little
,
and
brought
tears
out
of
my
eyes
,
and
I
*NL*
began
to
bless
myself
that
such
a
prodigy
of
nature
should
happen
upon
my
*NL*
account
;
and
this
was
the
more
strange
to
me
,
because
I
saw
near
it
*NL*
still
,
all
along
by
the
side
of
the
rock
,
some
other
straggling
stalks
,
*NL*
which
proved
to
be
stalks
of
rice
,
and
which
I
knew
,
because
I
had
seen
*NL*
it
grow
in
Africa
when
I
was
ashore
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
not
only
thought
these
the
pure
productions
of
Providence
for
my
*NL*
support
,
but
not
doubting
that
there
was
more
in
the
place
,
I
went
all
*NL*
over
that
part
of
the
island
,
where
I
had
been
before
,
peering
in
every
*NL*
corner
,
and
under
every
rock
,
to
see
for
more
of
it
,
but
I
could
not
find
*NL*
any
.
At
last
it
occurred
to
my
thoughts
that
I
shook
a
bag
of
chickens
'
*NL*
meat
out
in
that
place
;
and
then
the
wonder
began
to
cease
;
and
I
must
*NL*
confess
my
religious
thankfulness
to
God
's
providence
began
to
abate
,
*NL*
too
,
upon
the
discovering
that
all
this
was
nothing
but
what
was
common
;
*NL*
though
I
ought
to
have
been
as
thankful
for
so
strange
and
unforeseen
a
*NL*
providence
as
if
it
had
been
miraculous
;
for
it
was
really
the
work
of
*NL*
Providence
to
me
,
that
should
order
or
appoint
that
ten
or
twelve
grains
*NL*
of
corn
should
remain
unspoiled
,
when
the
rats
had
destroyed
all
the
*NL*
rest
,
as
if
it
had
been
dropped
from
heaven
;
as
also
,
that
I
should
throw
*NL*
it
out
in
that
particular
place
,
where
,
it
being
in
the
shade
of
a
high
*NL*
rock
,
it
sprang
up
immediately
;
whereas
,
if
I
had
thrown
it
anywhere
else
*NL*
at
that
time
,
it
had
been
burnt
up
and
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
carefully
saved
the
ears
of
this
corn
,
you
may
be
sure
,
in
their
*NL*
season
,
which
was
about
the
end
of
June
;
and
,
laying
up
every
corn
,
I
*NL*
resolved
to
sow
them
all
again
,
hoping
in
time
to
have
some
quantity
*NL*
sufficient
to
supply
me
with
bread
.
But
it
was
not
till
the
fourth
year
*NL*
that
I
could
allow
myself
the
least
grain
of
this
corn
to
eat
,
and
even
*NL*
then
but
sparingly
,
as
I
shall
say
afterwards
,
in
its
order
;
for
I
lost
*NL*
all
that
I
sowed
the
first
season
by
not
observing
the
proper
time
;
for
I
*NL*
sowed
it
just
before
the
dry
season
,
so
that
it
never
came
up
at
all
,
at
*NL*
least
not
as
it
would
have
done
;
of
which
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
barley
,
there
were
,
as
above
,
twenty
or
thirty
stalks
of
*NL*
rice
,
which
I
preserved
with
the
same
care
and
for
the
same
use
,
or
to
*NL*
the
same
purpose
--
to
make
me
bread
,
or
rather
food
;
for
I
found
ways
to
*NL*
cook
it
without
baking
,
though
I
did
that
also
after
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
my
Journal
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
worked
excessive
hard
these
three
or
four
months
to
get
my
wall
done
;
*NL*
and
the
14th
of
April
I
closed
it
up
,
contriving
to
go
into
it
,
not
by
a
*NL*
door
but
over
the
wall
,
by
a
ladder
,
that
there
might
be
no
sign
on
the
*NL*
outside
of
my
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
April
_
16
.
--
I
finished
the
ladder
;
so
I
went
up
the
ladder
to
the
top
,
*NL*
and
then
pulled
it
up
after
me
,
and
let
it
down
in
the
inside
.
This
was
*NL*
a
complete
enclosure
to
me
;
for
within
I
had
room
enough
,
and
nothing
*NL*
could
come
at
me
from
without
,
unless
it
could
first
mount
my
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
next
day
after
this
wall
was
finished
I
had
almost
had
all
my
*NL*
labour
overthrown
at
once
,
and
myself
killed
.
The
case
was
thus
:
As
I
*NL*
was
busy
in
the
inside
,
behind
my
tent
,
just
at
the
entrance
into
my
*NL*
cave
,
I
was
terribly
frighted
with
a
most
dreadful
,
surprising
thing
*NL*
indeed
;
for
all
on
a
sudden
I
found
the
earth
come
crumbling
down
from
*NL*
the
roof
of
my
cave
,
and
from
the
edge
of
the
hill
over
my
head
,
and
two
*NL*
of
the
posts
I
had
set
up
in
the
cave
cracked
in
a
frightful
manner
.
I
*NL*
was
heartily
scared
;
but
thought
nothing
of
what
was
really
the
cause
,
*NL*
only
thinking
that
the
top
of
my
cave
was
fallen
in
,
as
some
of
it
had
*NL*
done
before
:
and
for
fear
I
should
be
buried
in
it
I
ran
forward
to
my
*NL*
ladder
,
and
not
thinking
myself
safe
there
neither
,
I
got
over
my
wall
*NL*
for
fear
of
the
pieces
of
the
hill
,
which
I
expected
might
roll
down
upon
*NL*
me
.
I
had
no
sooner
stepped
do
ground
,
than
I
plainly
saw
it
was
a
*NL*
terrible
earthquake
,
for
the
ground
I
stood
on
shook
three
times
at
about
*NL*
eight
minutes
'
distance
,
with
three
such
shocks
as
would
have
overturned
*NL*
the
strongest
building
that
could
be
supposed
to
have
stood
on
the
earth
;
*NL*
and
a
great
piece
of
the
top
of
a
rock
which
stood
about
half
a
mile
from
*NL*
me
next
the
sea
fell
down
with
such
a
terrible
noise
as
I
never
heard
in
*NL*
all
my
life
.
I
perceived
also
the
very
sea
was
put
into
violent
motion
*NL*
by
it
;
and
I
believe
the
shocks
were
stronger
under
the
water
than
on
the
*NL*
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
much
amazed
with
the
thing
itself
,
having
never
felt
the
like
,
*NL*
nor
discoursed
with
any
one
that
had
,
that
I
was
like
one
dead
or
*NL*
stupefied
;
and
the
motion
of
the
earth
made
my
stomach
sick
,
like
one
*NL*
that
was
tossed
at
sea
;
but
the
noise
of
the
falling
of
the
rock
awakened
*NL*
me
,
as
it
were
,
and
rousing
me
from
the
stupefied
condition
I
was
in
,
*NL*
filled
me
with
horror
;
and
I
thought
of
nothing
then
but
the
hill
falling
*NL*
upon
my
tent
and
all
my
household
goods
,
and
burying
all
at
once
;
and
*NL*
this
sunk
my
very
soul
within
me
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
third
shock
was
over
,
and
I
felt
no
more
for
some
time
,
I
began
*NL*
to
take
courage
;
and
yet
I
had
not
heart
enough
to
go
over
my
wall
again
,
*NL*
for
fear
of
being
buried
alive
,
but
sat
still
upon
the
ground
greatly
*NL*
cast
down
and
disconsolate
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
.
All
this
while
I
had
*NL*
not
the
least
serious
religious
thought
;
nothing
but
the
common
``
Lord
*NL*
have
mercy
upon
me
!
''
and
when
it
was
over
that
went
away
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
sat
thus
,
I
found
the
air
overcast
and
grow
cloudy
,
as
if
it
*NL*
would
rain
.
Soon
after
that
the
wind
arose
by
little
and
little
,
so
that
*NL*
in
less
than
half-an-hour
it
blew
a
most
dreadful
hurricane
;
the
sea
was
*NL*
all
on
a
sudden
covered
over
with
foam
and
froth
;
the
shore
was
covered
*NL*
with
the
breach
of
the
water
,
the
trees
were
torn
up
by
the
roots
,
and
a
*NL*
terrible
storm
it
was
.
This
held
about
three
hours
,
and
then
began
to
*NL*
abate
;
and
in
two
hours
more
it
was
quite
calm
,
and
began
to
rain
very
*NL*
hard
.
All
this
while
I
sat
upon
the
ground
very
much
terrified
and
*NL*
dejected
;
when
on
a
sudden
it
came
into
my
thoughts
,
that
these
winds
and
*NL*
rain
being
the
consequences
of
the
earthquake
,
the
earthquake
itself
was
*NL*
spent
and
over
,
and
I
might
venture
into
my
cave
again
.
With
this
*NL*
thought
my
spirits
began
to
revive
;
and
the
rain
also
helping
to
persuade
*NL*
me
,
I
went
in
and
sat
down
in
my
tent
.
But
the
rain
was
so
violent
that
*NL*
my
tent
was
ready
to
be
beaten
down
with
it
;
and
I
was
forced
to
go
into
*NL*
my
cave
,
though
very
much
afraid
and
uneasy
,
for
fear
it
should
fall
on
*NL*
my
head
.
This
violent
rain
forced
me
to
a
new
work
--
viz
.
to
cut
a
hole
*NL*
through
my
new
fortification
,
like
a
sink
,
to
let
the
water
go
out
,
which
*NL*
would
else
have
flooded
my
cave
.
After
I
had
been
in
my
cave
for
some
*NL*
time
,
and
found
still
no
more
shocks
of
the
earthquake
follow
,
I
began
to
*NL*
be
more
composed
.
And
now
,
to
support
my
spirits
,
which
indeed
wanted
it
*NL*
very
much
,
I
went
to
my
little
store
,
and
took
a
small
sup
of
rum
;
which
,
*NL*
however
,
I
did
then
and
always
very
sparingly
,
knowing
I
could
have
no
*NL*
more
when
that
was
gone
.
It
continued
raining
all
that
night
and
great
*NL*
part
of
the
next
day
,
so
that
I
could
not
stir
abroad
;
but
my
mind
being
*NL*
more
composed
,
I
began
to
think
of
what
I
had
best
do
;
concluding
that
if
*NL*
the
island
was
subject
to
these
earthquakes
,
there
would
be
no
living
for
*NL*
me
in
a
cave
,
but
I
must
consider
of
building
a
little
hut
in
an
open
*NL*
place
which
I
might
surround
with
a
wall
,
as
I
had
done
here
,
and
so
make
*NL*
myself
secure
from
wild
beasts
or
men
;
for
I
concluded
,
if
I
stayed
where
*NL*
I
was
,
I
should
certainly
one
time
or
other
be
buried
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
thoughts
,
I
resolved
to
remove
my
tent
from
the
place
where
it
*NL*
stood
,
which
was
just
under
the
hanging
precipice
of
the
hill
;
and
which
,
*NL*
if
it
should
be
shaken
again
,
would
certainly
fall
upon
my
tent
;
and
I
*NL*
spent
the
two
next
days
,
being
the
19th
and
20th
of
April
,
in
contriving
*NL*
where
and
how
to
remove
my
habitation
.
The
fear
of
being
swallowed
up
*NL*
alive
made
me
that
I
never
slept
in
quiet
;
and
yet
the
apprehension
of
*NL*
lying
abroad
without
any
fence
was
almost
equal
to
it
;
but
still
,
when
I
*NL*
looked
about
,
and
saw
how
everything
was
put
in
order
,
how
pleasantly
*NL*
concealed
I
was
,
and
how
safe
from
danger
,
it
made
me
very
loath
to
*NL*
remove
.
In
the
meantime
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
require
a
vast
*NL*
deal
of
time
for
me
to
do
this
,
and
that
I
must
be
contented
to
venture
*NL*
where
I
was
,
till
I
had
formed
a
camp
for
myself
,
and
had
secured
it
so
*NL*
as
to
remove
to
it
.
So
with
this
resolution
I
composed
myself
for
a
*NL*
time
,
and
resolved
that
I
would
go
to
work
with
all
speed
to
build
me
a
*NL*
wall
with
piles
and
cables
,
&
c.
,
in
a
circle
,
as
before
,
and
set
my
tent
*NL*
up
in
it
when
it
was
finished
;
but
that
I
would
venture
to
stay
where
I
*NL*
was
till
it
was
finished
,
and
fit
to
remove
.
This
was
the
21st
.
*NL*

--
The
next
morning
I
begin
to
consider
of
means
to
put
this
*NL*
resolve
into
execution
;
but
I
was
at
a
great
loss
about
my
tools
.
I
had
*NL*
three
large
axes
,
and
abundance
of
hatchets
-LRB-
for
we
carried
the
hatchets
*NL*
for
traffic
with
the
Indians
-RRB-
;
but
with
much
chopping
and
cutting
knotty
*NL*
hard
wood
,
they
were
all
full
of
notches
,
and
dull
;
and
though
I
had
a
*NL*
grindstone
,
I
could
not
turn
it
and
grind
my
tools
too
.
This
cost
me
as
*NL*
much
thought
as
a
statesman
would
have
bestowed
upon
a
grand
point
of
*NL*
politics
,
or
a
judge
upon
the
life
and
death
of
a
man
.
At
length
I
*NL*
contrived
a
wheel
with
a
string
,
to
turn
it
with
my
foot
,
that
I
might
*NL*
have
both
my
hands
at
liberty
.
_
Note

.
--
I
had
never
seen
any
such
thing
*NL*
in
England
,
or
at
least
,
not
to
take
notice
how
it
was
done
,
though
since
*NL*
I
have
observed
,
it
is
very
common
there
;
besides
that
,
my
grindstone
was
*NL*
very
large
and
heavy
.
This
machine
cost
me
a
full
week
's
work
to
bring
*NL*
it
to
perfection
.

These
two

up

my
*NL*
machine
for
turning
my
grindstone
performing
very
well
.

Having
perceived
my
bread
had
been
low
a
great
while

I
*NL*
took
a
survey
of
it
,
and
reduced
myself
to
one
biscuit
cake
a
day
,
which
*NL*
made
my
heart
very
heavy
.

In
the
morning
,
looking
towards
the
sea
side
,
the
tide
being
*NL*
low
,
I
saw
something
lie
on
the
shore
bigger
than
ordinary
,
and
it
looked
*NL*
like
a
cask
;
when
I
came
to
it
,
I
found
a
small
barrel
,
and
two
or
three
*NL*
pieces
of
the
wreck
of
the
ship
,
which
were
driven
on
shore
by
the
late
*NL*
hurricane
;
and
looking
towards
the
wreck
itself
,
I
thought
it
seemed
to
*NL*
lie
higher
out
of
the
water
than
it
used
to
do
.
I
examined
the
barrel
*NL*
which
was
driven
on
shore
,
and
soon
found
it
was
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
;
*NL*
but
it
had
taken
water
,
and
the
powder
was
caked
as
hard
as
a
stone
;
*NL*
however
,
I
rolled
it
farther
on
shore
for
the
present
,
and
went
on
upon
*NL*
the
sands
,
as
near
as
I
could
to
the
wreck
of
the
ship
,
to
look
for
more
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
ILL
AND
CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
down
to
the
ship
I
found
it
strangely
removed
.
The
*NL*
forecastle
,
which
lay
before
buried
in
sand
,
was
heaved
up
at
least
six
*NL*
feet
,
and
the
stern
,
which
was
broke
in
pieces
and
parted
from
the
rest
*NL*
by
the
force
of
the
sea
,
soon
after
I
had
left
rummaging
her
,
was
tossed
*NL*
as
it
were
up
,
and
cast
on
one
side
;
and
the
sand
was
thrown
so
high
on
*NL*
that
side
next
her
stern
,
that
whereas
there
was
a
great
place
of
water
*NL*
before
,
so
that
I
could
not
come
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
wreck
*NL*
without
swimming
I
could
now
walk
quite
up
to
her
when
the
tide
was
out
.
*NL*
I
was
surprised
with
this
at
first
,
but
soon
concluded
it
must
be
done
by
*NL*
the
earthquake
;
and
as
by
this
violence
the
ship
was
more
broke
open
than
*NL*
formerly
,
so
many
things
came
daily
on
shore
,
which
the
sea
had
loosened
,
*NL*
and
which
the
winds
and
water
rolled
by
degrees
to
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
wholly
diverted
my
thoughts
from
the
design
of
removing
my
*NL*
habitation
,
and
I
busied
myself
mightily
,
that
day
especially
,
in
*NL*
searching
whether
I
could
make
any
way
into
the
ship
;
but
I
found
nothing
*NL*
was
to
be
expected
of
that
kind
,
for
all
the
inside
of
the
ship
was
*NL*
choked
up
with
sand
.
However
,
as
I
had
learned
not
to
despair
of
*NL*
anything
,
I
resolved
to
pull
everything
to
pieces
that
I
could
of
the
*NL*
ship
,
concluding
that
everything
I
could
get
from
her
would
be
of
some
*NL*
use
or
other
to
me
.

I
began
with
my
saw
,
and
cut
a
piece
of
a
beam
through
,
which
I
*NL*
thought
held
some
of
the
upper
part
or
quarter-deck
together
,
and
when
I
*NL*
had
cut
it
through
,
I
cleared
away
the
sand
as
well
as
I
could
from
the
*NL*
side
which
lay
highest
;
but
the
tide
coming
in
,
I
was
obliged
to
give
*NL*
over
for
that
time
.

I
went
a-fishing

but
caught
not
one
fish
that
I
durst
eat
of
,
*NL*
till
I
was
weary
of
my
sport
;
when
,
just
going
to
leave
off
,
I
caught
a
*NL*
young
dolphin
.
I
had
made
me
a
long
line
of
some
rope-yarn
,
but
I
had
no
*NL*
hooks
;
yet
I
frequently
caught
fish
enough
,
as
much
as
I
cared
to
eat
;
*NL*
all
which
I
dried
in
the
sun
,
and
ate
them
dry

tied
together

to

Went
to
the

again

not
with
an
intent

but
found
*NL*
the
weight
of
the
wreck
had
broke
itself
down
,
the
beams
being
cut
;
that
*NL*
several
pieces
of
the
ship
seemed
to
lie
loose
,
and
the
inside
of
the
*NL*
hold
lay
so
open
that
I
could
see
into
it
;
but
it
was
almost
full
of
*NL*
water
and
sand
.

up

deck
,
which
lay
now
quite
clear
of
the
water
or
sand
.
I
wrenched
open
*NL*
two
planks
,
and
brought
them
on
shore
also
with
the

I
left
the

iron
crow
in
the
wreck
for

several

loosened
them
with

could
not

I
felt
also
a
roll
of

lead
,

could

it
was
too

to

Every
day
,
to
this
day

I
worked
on
the
wreck
;
and
with
hard
*NL*
labour
I
loosened
some
things
so
much
with
the
crow
,
that
the
first
*NL*
flowing
tide
several
casks
floated
out
,
and
two
of
the
seamen
's
chests
;
*NL*
but
the
wind
blowing
from
the
shore
,
nothing
came
to
land
that
day
but
*NL*
pieces
of
timber
,
and
a
hogshead
,
which
had
some
Brazil
pork
in
it
;
but
*NL*
the
salt
water
and
the
sand
had
spoiled
it
.
I
continued
this
work
every
*NL*
day
to
the
15th
of
June
,
except
the
time
necessary
to
get
food
,
which
I
*NL*
always
appointed
,
during
this
part
of
my
employment
,
to
be
when
the
tide
*NL*
was
up
,
that
I
might
be
ready
when
it
was
ebbed
out
;
and
by
this
time
I
*NL*
had
got
timber
and
plank
and
ironwork
enough
to
have
built
a
good
boat
,
*NL*
if
I
had
known
how
;
and
also
I
got
,
at
several
times
and
in
several
*NL*
pieces
,
near
one
hundredweight
of
the
sheet
lead
.

--
Going
down
to
the
seaside
,
I
found
a
large
tortoise
or
*NL*
turtle
.
This
was
the
first
I
had
seen
,
which
,
it
seems
,
was
only
my
*NL*
misfortune
,
not
any
defect
of
the
place
,
or
scarcity
;
for
had
I
happened
*NL*
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
I
might
have
had
hundreds
of
them
*NL*
every
day
,
as
I
found
afterwards
;
but
perhaps
had
paid
dear
enough
for
*NL*
them
.

I
spent
in
cooking
the
turtle
.
I
found
in
her
three-score
*NL*
eggs
;
and
her
flesh
was
to
me
,
at
that
time
,
the
most
savoury
and
*NL*
pleasant
that
ever
I
tasted
in
my
life
,
having
had
no
flesh
,
but
of
goats
*NL*
and
fowls
,
since
I
landed
in
this
horrid
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June

.
--
Rained
all
day
,
and
I
stayed
within
.
I
thought
at
this
time
*NL*
the
rain
felt
cold
,
and
I
was
something
chilly
;
which
I
knew
was
not
*NL*
usual
in
that
latitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
_

Very
ill
,
and
shivering
,
as
if
the
weather
had
been
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
_

--
No
rest
all
night
;
violent
pains
in
my
head
,
and
feverish
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June

--
Very
ill
;
frighted
almost
to
death
with
the
apprehensions
of
*NL*
my
sad
condition
--
to
be
sick
,
and
no
help
.
Prayed
to
God
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
since
the
storm
off
Hull
,
but
scarce
knew
what
I
said
,
or
why
,
my
*NL*
thoughts
being
all
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
_

A
little
better
;
but
under
dreadful
apprehensions
of
*NL*
sickness
.

_

Very

An
ague
very
violent
;
the
fit
held
me
seven
hours

cold

and
hot
,
with
faint
sweats
after
it

Better
;
and
having
no
victuals
to
eat
,
took
my
gun
,
but
found
*NL*
myself
very
weak
.
However
,
I
killed
a
she-goat
,
and
with
much
difficulty
*NL*
got
it
home
,
and
broiled
some
of
it
,
and
ate
,
I
would
fain
have
stewed
*NL*
it
,
and
made
some
broth
,
but
had
no
pot
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June
_

.
--
The
ague
again
so
violent
that
I
lay
a-bed
all
day
,
and
*NL*
neither
ate
nor
drank
.
I
was
ready
to
perish
for
thirst
;
but
so
weak
,
I
*NL*
had
not
strength
to
stand
up
,
or
to
get
myself
any
water
to
drink
.
*NL*
Prayed
to
God
again
,
but
was
light-headed
;
and
when
I
was
not
,
I
was
so
*NL*
ignorant
that
I
knew
not
what
to
say
;
only
I
lay
and
cried
,
``
Lord
,
look
*NL*
upon
me
!
Lord
,
pity
me
!
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
me
!
''
I
suppose
I
did
*NL*
nothing
else
for
two
or
three
hours
;
till
,
the
fit
wearing
off
,
I
fell
*NL*
asleep
,
and
did
not
wake
till
far
in
the
night
.
When
I
awoke
,
I
found
*NL*
myself
much
refreshed
,
but
weak
,
and
exceeding
thirsty
.
However
,
as
I
*NL*
had
no
water
in
my
habitation
,
I
was
forced
to
lie
till
morning
,
and
went
*NL*
to
sleep
again
.
In
this
second
sleep
I
had
this
terrible
dream
:
I
*NL*
thought
that
I
was
sitting
on
the
ground
,
on
the
outside
of
my
wall
,
*NL*
where
I
sat
when
the
storm
blew
after
the
earthquake
,
and
that
I
saw
a
*NL*
man
descend
from
a
great
black
cloud
,
in
a
bright
flame
of
fire
,
and
*NL*
light
upon
the
ground
.
He
was
all
over
as
bright
as
a
flame
,
so
that
I
*NL*
could
but
just
bear
to
look
towards
him
;
his
countenance
was
most
*NL*
inexpressibly
dreadful
,
impossible
for
words
to
describe
.
When
he
*NL*
stepped
upon
the
ground
with
his
feet
,
I
thought
the
earth
trembled
,
just
*NL*
as
it
had
done
before
in
the
earthquake
,
and
all
the
air
looked
,
to
my
*NL*
apprehension
,
as
if
it
had
been
filled
with
flashes
of
fire
.
He
was
no
*NL*
sooner
landed
upon
the
earth
,
but
he
moved
forward
towards
me
,
with
a
*NL*
long
spear
or
weapon
in
his
hand
,
to
kill
me
;
and
when
he
came
to
a
*NL*
rising
ground
,
at
some
distance
,
he
spoke
to
me
--
or
I
heard
a
voice
so
*NL*
terrible
that
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
terror
of
it
.
All
that
I
*NL*
can
say
I
understood
was
this
:
``
Seeing
all
these
things
have
not
brought
*NL*
thee
to
repentance
,
now
thou
shalt
die
;
''
at
which
words
,
I
thought
he
*NL*
lifted
up
the
spear
that
was
in
his
hand
to
kill
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
that
shall
ever
read
this
account
will
expect
that
I
should
be
*NL*
able
to
describe
the
horrors
of
my
soul
at
this
terrible
vision
.
I
mean
,
*NL*
that
even
while
it
was
a
dream
,
I
even
dreamed
of
those
horrors
.
Nor
is
*NL*
it
any
more
possible
to
describe
the
impression
that
remained
upon
my
*NL*
mind
when
I
awaked
,
and
found
it
was
but
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
,
alas
!
no
divine
knowledge
.
What
I
had
received
by
the
good
*NL*
instruction
of
my
father
was
then
worn
out
by
an
uninterrupted
series
,
*NL*
for
eight
years
,
of
seafaring
wickedness
,
and
a
constant
conversation
*NL*
with
none
but
such
as
were
,
like
myself
,
wicked
and
profane
to
the
last
*NL*
degree
.
I
do
not
remember
that
I
had
,
in
all
that
time
,
one
thought
that
*NL*
so
much
as
tended
either
to
looking
upwards
towards
God
,
or
inwards
*NL*
towards
a
reflection
upon
my
own
ways
;
but
a
certain
stupidity
of
soul
,
*NL*
without
desire
of
good
,
or
conscience
of
evil
,
had
entirely
overwhelmed
*NL*
me
;
and
I
was
all
that
the
most
hardened
,
unthinking
,
wicked
creature
*NL*
among
our
common
sailors
can
be
supposed
to
be
;
not
having
the
least
*NL*
sense
,
either
of
the
fear
of
God
in
danger
,
or
of
thankfulness
to
God
in
*NL*
deliverance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
relating
what
is
already
past
of
my
story
,
this
will
be
the
more
*NL*
easily
believed
when
I
shall
add
,
that
through
all
the
variety
of
*NL*
miseries
that
had
to
this
day
befallen
me
,
I
never
had
so
much
as
one
*NL*
thought
of
it
being
the
hand
of
God
,
or
that
it
was
a
just
punishment
for
*NL*
my
sin
--
my
rebellious
behaviour
against
my
father
--
or
my
present
sins
,
*NL*
which
were
great
--
or
so
much
as
a
punishment
for
the
general
course
of
my
*NL*
wicked
life
.
When
I
was
on
the
desperate
expedition
on
the
desert
shores
*NL*
of
Africa
,
I
never
had
so
much
as
one
thought
of
what
would
become
of
me
,
*NL*
or
one
wish
to
God
to
direct
me
whither
I
should
go
,
or
to
keep
me
from
*NL*
the
danger
which
apparently
surrounded
me
,
as
well
from
voracious
*NL*
creatures
as
cruel
savages
.
But
I
was
merely
thoughtless
of
a
God
or
a
*NL*
Providence
,
acted
like
a
mere
brute
,
from
the
principles
of
nature
,
and
*NL*
by
the
dictates
of
common
sense
only
,
and
,
indeed
,
hardly
that
.
When
I
*NL*
was
delivered
and
taken
up
at
sea
by
the
Portugal
captain
,
well
used
,
and
*NL*
dealt
justly
and
honourably
with
,
as
well
as
charitably
,
I
had
not
the
*NL*
least
thankfulness
in
my
thoughts
.
When
,
again
,
I
was
shipwrecked
,
*NL*
ruined
,
and
in
danger
of
drowning
on
this
island
,
I
was
as
far
from
*NL*
remorse
,
or
looking
on
it
as
a
judgment
.
I
only
said
to
myself
often
,
*NL*
that
I
was
an
unfortunate
dog
,
and
born
to
be
always
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
,
when
I
got
on
shore
first
here
,
and
found
all
my
ship
's
crew
*NL*
drowned
and
myself
spared
,
I
was
surprised
with
a
kind
of
ecstasy
,
and
*NL*
some
transports
of
soul
,
which
,
had
the
grace
of
God
assisted
,
might
have
*NL*
come
up
to
true
thankfulness
;
but
it
ended
where
it
began
,
in
a
mere
*NL*
common
flight
of
joy
,
or
,
as
I
may
say
,
being
glad
I
was
alive
,
without
*NL*
the
least
reflection
upon
the
distinguished
goodness
of
the
hand
which
*NL*
had
preserved
me
,
and
had
singled
me
out
to
be
preserved
when
all
the
*NL*
rest
were
destroyed
,
or
an
inquiry
why
Providence
had
been
thus
merciful
*NL*
unto
me
.
Even
just
the
same
common
sort
of
joy
which
seamen
generally
*NL*
have
,
after
they
are
got
safe
ashore
from
a
shipwreck
,
which
they
drown
*NL*
all
in
the
next
bowl
of
punch
,
and
forget
almost
as
soon
as
it
is
over
;
*NL*
and
all
the
rest
of
my
life
was
like
it
.
Even
when
I
was
afterwards
,
on
*NL*
due
consideration
,
made
sensible
of
my
condition
,
how
I
was
cast
on
this
*NL*
dreadful
place
,
out
of
the
reach
of
human
kind
,
out
of
all
hope
of
*NL*
relief
,
or
prospect
of
redemption
,
as
soon
as
I
saw
but
a
prospect
of
*NL*
living
and
that
I
should
not
starve
and
perish
for
hunger
,
all
the
sense
*NL*
of
my
affliction
wore
off
;
and
I
began
to
be
very
easy
,
applied
myself
to
*NL*
the
works
proper
for
my
preservation
and
supply
,
and
was
far
enough
from
*NL*
being
afflicted
at
my
condition
,
as
a
judgment
from
heaven
,
or
as
the
*NL*
hand
of
God
against
me
:
these
were
thoughts
which
very
seldom
entered
my
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
growing
up
of
the
corn
,
as
is
hinted
in
my
Journal
,
had
at
first
some
*NL*
little
influence
upon
me
,
and
began
to
affect
me
with
seriousness
,
as
*NL*
long
as
I
thought
it
had
something
miraculous
in
it
;
but
as
soon
as
ever
*NL*
that
part
of
the
thought
was
removed
,
all
the
impression
that
was
raised
*NL*
from
it
wore
off
also
,
as
I
have
noted
already
.
Even
the
earthquake
,
*NL*
though
nothing
could
be
more
terrible
in
its
nature
,
or
more
immediately
*NL*
directing
to
the
invisible
Power
which
alone
directs
such
things
,
yet
no
*NL*
sooner
was
the
first
fright
over
,
but
the
impression
it
had
made
went
off
*NL*
also
.
I
had
no
more
sense
of
God
or
His
judgments
--
much
less
of
the
*NL*
present
affliction
of
my
circumstances
being
from
His
hand
--
than
if
I
had
*NL*
been
in
the
most
prosperous
condition
of
life
.
But
now
,
when
I
began
to
*NL*
be
sick
,
and
a
leisurely
view
of
the
miseries
of
death
came
to
place
*NL*
itself
before
me
;
when
my
spirits
began
to
sink
under
the
burden
of
a
*NL*
strong
distemper
,
and
nature
was
exhausted
with
the
violence
of
the
*NL*
fever
;
conscience
,
that
had
slept
so
long
,
began
to
awake
,
and
I
began
to
*NL*
reproach
myself
with
my
past
life
,
in
which
I
had
so
evidently
,
by
*NL*
uncommon
wickedness
,
provoked
the
justice
of
God
to
lay
me
under
uncommon
*NL*
strokes
,
and
to
deal
with
me
in
so
vindictive
a
manner
.
These
*NL*
reflections
oppressed
me
for
the
second
or
third
day
of
my
distemper
;
and
*NL*
in
the
violence
,
as
well
of
the
fever
as
of
the
dreadful
reproaches
of
my
*NL*
conscience
,
extorted
some
words
from
me
like
praying
to
God
,
though
I
*NL*
can
not
say
they
were
either
a
prayer
attended
with
desires
or
with
hopes
:
*NL*
it
was
rather
the
voice
of
mere
fright
and
distress
.
My
thoughts
were
*NL*
confused
,
the
convictions
great
upon
my
mind
,
and
the
horror
of
dying
in
*NL*
such
a
miserable
condition
raised
vapours
into
my
head
with
the
mere
*NL*
apprehensions
;
and
in
these
hurries
of
my
soul
I
knew
not
what
my
tongue
*NL*
might
express
.
But
it
was
rather
exclamation
,
such
as
,
``
Lord
,
what
a
*NL*
miserable
creature
am
I
!
If
I
should
be
sick
,
I
shall
certainly
die
for
*NL*
want
of
help
;
and
what
will
become
of
me
!
''
Then
the
tears
burst
out
of
*NL*
my
eyes
,
and
I
could
say
no
more
for
a
good
while
.
In
this
interval
the
*NL*
good
advice
of
my
father
came
to
my
mind
,
and
presently
his
prediction
,
*NL*
which
I
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
--
viz
.
that
if
I
did
take
*NL*
this
foolish
step
,
God
would
not
bless
me
,
and
I
would
have
leisure
*NL*
hereafter
to
reflect
upon
having
neglected
his
counsel
when
there
might
*NL*
be
none
to
assist
in
my
recovery
.
``
Now
,
''
said
I
,
aloud
,
``
my
dear
*NL*
father
's
words
are
come
to
pass
;
God
's
justice
has
overtaken
me
,
and
I
*NL*
have
none
to
help
or
hear
me
.
I
rejected
the
voice
of
Providence
,
which
*NL*
had
mercifully
put
me
in
a
posture
or
station
of
life
wherein
I
might
*NL*
have
been
happy
and
easy
;
but
I
would
neither
see
it
myself
nor
learn
to
*NL*
know
the
blessing
of
it
from
my
parents
.
I
left
them
to
mourn
over
my
*NL*
folly
,
and
now
I
am
left
to
mourn
under
the
consequences
of
it
.
I
abused
*NL*
their
help
and
assistance
,
who
would
have
lifted
me
in
the
world
,
and
*NL*
would
have
made
everything
easy
to
me
;
and
now
I
have
difficulties
to
*NL*
struggle
with
,
too
great
for
even
nature
itself
to
support
,
and
no
*NL*
assistance
,
no
help
,
no
comfort
,
no
advice
.
''
Then
I
cried
out
,
``
Lord
,
be
*NL*
my
help
,
for
I
am
in
great
distress
.
''
This
was
the
first
prayer
,
if
I
*NL*
may
call
it
so
,
that
I
had
made
for
many
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
my
Journal
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
June
_
28
.
--
Having
been
somewhat
refreshed
with
the
sleep
I
had
had
,
and
*NL*
the
fit
being
entirely
off
,
I
got
up
;
and
though
the
fright
and
terror
of
*NL*
my
dream
was
very
great
,
yet
I
considered
that
the
fit
of
the
ague
would
*NL*
return
again
the
next
day
,
and
now
was
my
time
to
get
something
to
*NL*
refresh
and
support
myself
when
I
should
be
ill
;
and
the
first
thing
I
*NL*
did
,
I
filled
a
large
square
case-bottle
with
water
,
and
set
it
upon
my
*NL*
table
,
in
reach
of
my
bed
;
and
to
take
off
the
chill
or
aguish
*NL*
disposition
of
the
water
,
I
put
about
a
quarter
of
a
pint
of
rum
into
it
,
*NL*
and
mixed
them
together
.
Then
I
got
me
a
piece
of
the
goat
's
flesh
and
*NL*
broiled
it
on
the
coals
,
but
could
eat
very
little
.
I
walked
about
,
but
*NL*
was
very
weak
,
and
withal
very
sad
and
heavy-hearted
under
a
sense
of
my
*NL*
miserable
condition
,
dreading
,
the
return
of
my
distemper
the
next
day
.
*NL*
At
night
I
made
my
supper
of
three
of
the
turtle
's
eggs
,
which
I
roasted
*NL*
in
the
ashes
,
and
ate
,
as
we
call
it
,
in
the
shell
,
and
this
was
the
*NL*
first
bit
of
meat
I
had
ever
asked
God
's
blessing
to
,
that
I
could
*NL*
remember
,
in
my
whole
life
.
After
I
had
eaten
I
tried
to
walk
,
but
found
*NL*
myself
so
weak
that
I
could
hardly
carry
a
gun
,
for
I
never
went
out
*NL*
without
that
;
so
I
went
but
a
little
way
,
and
sat
down
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
looking
out
upon
the
sea
,
which
was
just
before
me
,
and
very
calm
and
*NL*
smooth
.
As
I
sat
here
some
such
thoughts
as
these
occurred
to
me
:
What
*NL*
is
this
earth
and
sea
,
of
which
I
have
seen
so
much
?
Whence
is
it
*NL*
produced
?
And
what
am
I
,
and
all
the
other
creatures
wild
and
tame
,
*NL*
human
and
brutal
?
Whence
are
we
?
Sure
we
are
all
made
by
some
secret
*NL*
Power
,
who
formed
the
earth
and
sea
,
the
air
and
sky
.
And
who
is
that
?
*NL*
Then
it
followed
most
naturally
,
it
is
God
that
has
made
all
.
Well
,
but
*NL*
then
it
came
on
strangely
,
if
God
has
made
all
these
things
,
He
guides
*NL*
and
governs
them
all
,
and
all
things
that
concern
them
;
for
the
Power
*NL*
that
could
make
all
things
must
certainly
have
power
to
guide
and
direct
*NL*
them
.
If
so
,
nothing
can
happen
in
the
great
circuit
of
His
works
,
*NL*
either
without
His
knowledge
or
appointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
nothing
happens
without
His
knowledge
,
He
knows
that
I
am
here
,
*NL*
and
am
in
this
dreadful
condition
;
and
if
nothing
happens
without
His
*NL*
appointment
,
He
has
appointed
all
this
to
befall
me
.
Nothing
occurred
to
*NL*
my
thought
to
contradict
any
of
these
conclusions
,
and
therefore
it
*NL*
rested
upon
me
with
the
greater
force
,
that
it
must
needs
be
that
God
had
*NL*
appointed
all
this
to
befall
me
;
that
I
was
brought
into
this
miserable
*NL*
circumstance
by
His
direction
,
He
having
the
sole
power
,
not
of
me
only
,
*NL*
but
of
everything
that
happened
in
the
world
.
Immediately
it
followed
:
*NL*
Why
has
God
done
this
to
me
?
What
have
I
done
to
be
thus
used
?
My
*NL*
conscience
presently
checked
me
in
that
inquiry
,
as
if
I
had
blasphemed
,
*NL*
and
methought
it
spoke
to
me
like
a
voice
:
``
Wretch
!
dost
_
thou
_
ask
what
*NL*
thou
hast
done
?
Look
back
upon
a
dreadful
misspent
life
,
and
ask
thyself
*NL*
what
thou
hast
_
not
_
done
?
Ask
,
why
is
it
that
thou
wert
not
long
ago
*NL*
destroyed
?
Why
wert
thou
not
drowned
in
Yarmouth
Roads
;
killed
in
the
*NL*
fight
when
the
ship
was
taken
by
the
Sallee
man-of-war
;
devoured
by
the
*NL*
wild
beasts
on
the
coast
of
Africa
;
or
drowned
_
here
_
,
when
all
the
crew
*NL*
perished
but
thyself
?
Dost
_
thou
_
ask
,
what
have
I
done
?
''
I
was
struck
*NL*
dumb
with
these
reflections
,
as
one
astonished
,
and
had
not
a
word
to
*NL*
say
--
no
,
not
to
answer
to
myself
,
but
rose
up
pensive
and
sad
,
walked
*NL*
back
to
my
retreat
,
and
went
up
over
my
wall
,
as
if
I
had
been
going
to
*NL*
bed
;
but
my
thoughts
were
sadly
disturbed
,
and
I
had
no
inclination
to
*NL*
sleep
;
so
I
sat
down
in
my
chair
,
and
lighted
my
lamp
,
for
it
began
to
be
*NL*
dark
.
Now
,
as
the
apprehension
of
the
return
of
my
distemper
terrified
*NL*
me
very
much
,
it
occurred
to
my
thought
that
the
Brazilians
take
no
*NL*
physic
but
their
tobacco
for
almost
all
distempers
,
and
I
had
a
piece
of
*NL*
a
roll
of
tobacco
in
one
of
the
chests
,
which
was
quite
cured
,
and
some
*NL*
also
that
was
green
,
and
not
quite
cured
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
,
directed
by
Heaven
no
doubt
;
for
in
this
chest
I
found
a
cure
*NL*
both
for
soul
and
body
.
I
opened
the
chest
,
and
found
what
I
looked
for
,
*NL*
the
tobacco
;
and
as
the
few
books
I
had
saved
lay
there
too
,
I
took
out
*NL*
one
of
the
Bibles
which
I
mentioned
before
,
and
which
to
this
time
I
had
*NL*
not
found
leisure
or
inclination
to
look
into
.
I
say
,
I
took
it
out
,
and
*NL*
brought
both
that
and
the
tobacco
with
me
to
the
table
.
What
use
to
make
*NL*
of
the
tobacco
I
knew
not
,
in
my
distemper
,
or
whether
it
was
good
for
it
*NL*
or
no
:
but
I
tried
several
experiments
with
it
,
as
if
I
was
resolved
it
*NL*
should
hit
one
way
or
other
.
I
first
took
a
piece
of
leaf
,
and
chewed
it
*NL*
in
my
mouth
,
which
,
indeed
,
at
first
almost
stupefied
my
brain
,
the
*NL*
tobacco
being
green
and
strong
,
and
that
I
had
not
been
much
used
to
.
*NL*
Then
I
took
some
and
steeped
it
an
hour
or
two
in
some
rum
,
and
resolved
*NL*
to
take
a
dose
of
it
when
I
lay
down
;
and
lastly
,
I
burnt
some
upon
a
pan
*NL*
of
coals
,
and
held
my
nose
close
over
the
smoke
of
it
as
long
as
I
could
*NL*
bear
it
,
as
well
for
the
heat
as
almost
for
suffocation
.
In
the
interval
*NL*
of
this
operation
I
took
up
the
Bible
and
began
to
read
;
but
my
head
was
*NL*
too
much
disturbed
with
the
tobacco
to
bear
reading
,
at
least
at
that
*NL*
time
;
only
,
having
opened
the
book
casually
,
the
first
words
that
*NL*
occurred
to
me
were
these
,
``
Call
on
Me
in
the
day
of
trouble
,
and
I
will
*NL*
deliver
thee
,
and
thou
shalt
glorify
Me
.
''
These
words
were
very
apt
to
*NL*
my
case
,
and
made
some
impression
upon
my
thoughts
at
the
time
of
reading
*NL*
them
,
though
not
so
much
as
they
did
afterwards
;
for
,
as
for
being
*NL*
_
delivered
_
,
the
word
had
no
sound
,
as
I
may
say
,
to
me
;
the
thing
was
so
*NL*
remote
,
so
impossible
in
my
apprehension
of
things
,
that
I
began
to
say
,
*NL*
as
the
children
of
Israel
did
when
they
were
promised
flesh
to
eat
,
``
Can
*NL*
God
spread
a
table
in
the
wilderness
?
''
so
I
began
to
say
,
``
Can
God
*NL*
Himself
deliver
me
from
this
place
?
''
And
as
it
was
not
for
many
years
*NL*
that
any
hopes
appeared
,
this
prevailed
very
often
upon
my
thoughts
;
but
,
*NL*
however
,
the
words
made
a
great
impression
upon
me
,
and
I
mused
upon
them
*NL*
very
often
.
It
grew
now
late
,
and
the
tobacco
had
,
as
I
said
,
dozed
my
*NL*
head
so
much
that
I
inclined
to
sleep
;
so
I
left
my
lamp
burning
in
the
*NL*
cave
,
lest
I
should
want
anything
in
the
night
,
and
went
to
bed
.
But
*NL*
before
I
lay
down
,
I
did
what
I
never
had
done
in
all
my
life
--
I
kneeled
*NL*
down
,
and
prayed
to
God
to
fulfil
the
promise
to
me
,
that
if
I
called
*NL*
upon
Him
in
the
day
of
trouble
,
He
would
deliver
me
.
After
my
broken
and
*NL*
imperfect
prayer
was
over
,
I
drank
the
rum
in
which
I
had
steeped
the
*NL*
tobacco
,
which
was
so
strong
and
rank
of
the
tobacco
that
I
could
*NL*
scarcely
get
it
down
;
immediately
upon
this
I
went
to
bed
.
I
found
*NL*
presently
it
flew
up
into
my
head
violently
;
but
I
fell
into
a
sound
*NL*
sleep
,
and
waked
no
more
till
,
by
the
sun
,
it
must
necessarily
be
near
*NL*
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
the
next
day
--
nay
,
to
this
hour
I
am
*NL*
partly
of
opinion
that
I
slept
all
the
next
day
and
night
,
and
till
*NL*
almost
three
the
day
after
;
for
otherwise
I
know
not
how
I
should
lose
a
*NL*
day
out
of
my
reckoning
in
the
days
of
the
week
,
as
it
appeared
some
*NL*
years
after
I
had
done
;
for
if
I
had
lost
it
by
crossing
and
recrossing
*NL*
the
line
,
I
should
have
lost
more
than
one
day
;
but
certainly
I
lost
a
*NL*
day
in
my
account
,
and
never
knew
which
way
.
Be
that
,
however
,
one
way
*NL*
or
the
other
,
when
I
awaked
I
found
myself
exceedingly
refreshed
,
and
my
*NL*
spirits
lively
and
cheerful
;
when
I
got
up
I
was
stronger
than
I
was
the
*NL*
day
before
,
and
my
stomach
better
,
for
I
was
hungry
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
had
*NL*
no
fit
the
next
day
,
but
continued
much
altered
for
the
better
.
This
was
*NL*
the
29th
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
30th
was
my
well
day
,
of
course
,
and
I
went
abroad
with
my
gun
,
but
*NL*
did
not
care
to
travel
too
far
.
I
killed
a
sea-fowl
or
two
,
something
*NL*
like
a
brandgoose
,
and
brought
them
home
,
but
was
not
very
forward
to
eat
*NL*
them
;
so
I
ate
some
more
of
the
turtle
's
eggs
,
which
were
very
good
.
*NL*
This
evening
I
renewed
the
medicine
,
which
I
had
supposed
did
me
good
the
*NL*
day
before
--
the
tobacco
steeped
in
rum
;
only
I
did
not
take
so
much
as
*NL*
before
,
nor
did
I
chew
any
of
the
leaf
,
or
hold
my
head
over
the
smoke
;
*NL*
however
,
I
was
not
so
well
the
next
day
,
which
was
the
first
of
July
,
as
*NL*
I
hoped
I
should
have
been
;
for
I
had
a
little
spice
of
the
cold
fit
,
but
*NL*
it
was
not
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
July
_

.
--
I
renewed
the
medicine
all
the
three
ways
;
and
dosed
myself
*NL*
with
it
as
at
first
,
and
doubled
the
quantity
which
I
drank
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
July
_

.
--
I
missed
the
fit
for
good
and
all
,
though
I
did
not
recover
my
*NL*
full
strength
for
some
weeks
after
.
While
I
was
thus
gathering
strength
,
*NL*
my
thoughts
ran
exceedingly
upon
this
Scripture
,
``
I
will
deliver
thee
''
;
*NL*
and
the
impossibility
of
my
deliverance
lay
much
upon
my
mind
,
in
bar
of
*NL*
my
ever
expecting
it
;
but
as
I
was
discouraging
myself
with
such
*NL*
thoughts
,
it
occurred
to
my
mind
that
I
pored
so
much
upon
my
deliverance
*NL*
from
the
main
affliction
,
that
I
disregarded
the
deliverance
I
had
*NL*
received
,
and
I
was
as
it
were
made
to
ask
myself
such
questions
as
*NL*
these
--
viz
.
Have
I
not
been
delivered
,
and
wonderfully
too
,
from
*NL*
sickness
--
from
the
most
distressed
condition
that
could
be
,
and
that
was
*NL*
so
frightful
to
me
?
and
what
notice
had
I
taken
of
it
?
Had
I
done
my
*NL*
part
?
God
had
delivered
me
,
but
I
had
not
glorified
Him
--
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
I
had
not
owned
and
been
thankful
for
that
as
a
deliverance
;
and
how
*NL*
could
I
expect
greater
deliverance
?
This
touched
my
heart
very
much
;
and
*NL*
immediately
I
knelt
down
and
gave
God
thanks
aloud
for
my
recovery
from
*NL*
my
sickness
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
July
_
4
.
--
In
the
morning
I
took
the
Bible
;
and
beginning
at
the
New
*NL*
Testament
,
I
began
seriously
to
read
it
,
and
imposed
upon
myself
to
read
*NL*
a
while
every
morning
and
every
night
;
not
tying
myself
to
the
number
of
*NL*
chapters
,
but
long
as
my
thoughts
should
engage
me
.
It
was
not
long
*NL*
after
I
set
seriously
to
this
work
till
I
found
my
heart
more
deeply
and
*NL*
sincerely
affected
with
the
wickedness
of
my
past
life
.
The
impression
*NL*
of
my
dream
revived
;
and
the
words
,
``
All
these
things
have
not
brought
*NL*
thee
to
repentance
,
''
ran
seriously
through
my
thoughts
.
I
was
earnestly
*NL*
begging
of
God
to
give
me
repentance
,
when
it
happened
providentially
,
*NL*
the
very
day
,
that
,
reading
the
Scripture
,
I
came
to
these
words
:
``
He
is
*NL*
exalted
a
Prince
and
a
Saviour
,
to
give
repentance
and
to
give
*NL*
remission
.
''
I
threw
down
the
book
;
and
with
my
heart
as
well
as
my
hands
*NL*
lifted
up
to
heaven
,
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
of
joy
,
I
cried
out
aloud
,
*NL*
``
Jesus
,
thou
son
of
David
!
Jesus
,
thou
exalted
Prince
and
Saviour
!
give
*NL*
me
repentance
!
''
This
was
the
first
time
I
could
say
,
in
the
true
sense
*NL*
of
the
words
,
that
I
prayed
in
all
my
life
;
for
now
I
prayed
with
a
sense
*NL*
of
my
condition
,
and
a
true
Scripture
view
of
hope
,
founded
on
the
*NL*
encouragement
of
the
Word
of
God
;
and
from
this
time
,
I
may
say
,
I
began
*NL*
to
hope
that
God
would
hear
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
began
to
construe
the
words
mentioned
above
,
``
Call
on
Me
,
and
I
*NL*
will
deliver
thee
,
''
in
a
different
sense
from
what
I
had
ever
done
*NL*
before
;
for
then
I
had
no
notion
of
anything
being
called
_
deliverance
_
,
*NL*
but
my
being
delivered
from
the
captivity
I
was
in
;
for
though
I
was
*NL*
indeed
at
large
in
the
place
,
yet
the
island
was
certainly
a
prison
to
*NL*
me
,
and
that
in
the
worse
sense
in
the
world
.
But
now
I
learned
to
take
*NL*
it
in
another
sense
:
now
I
looked
back
upon
my
past
life
with
such
*NL*
horror
,
and
my
sins
appeared
so
dreadful
,
that
my
soul
sought
nothing
of
*NL*
God
but
deliverance
from
the
load
of
guilt
that
bore
down
all
my
comfort
.
*NL*
As
for
my
solitary
life
,
it
was
nothing
.
I
did
not
so
much
as
pray
to
be
*NL*
delivered
from
it
or
think
of
it
;
it
was
all
of
no
consideration
in
*NL*
comparison
to
this
.
And
I
add
this
part
here
,
to
hint
to
whoever
shall
*NL*
read
it
,
that
whenever
they
come
to
a
true
sense
of
things
,
they
will
*NL*
find
deliverance
from
sin
a
much
greater
blessing
than
deliverance
from
*NL*
affliction
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
leaving
this
part
,
I
return
to
my
Journal
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
condition
began
now
to
be
,
though
not
less
miserable
as
to
my
way
of
*NL*
living
,
yet
much
easier
to
my
mind
:
and
my
thoughts
being
directed
,
by
a
*NL*
constant
reading
the
Scripture
and
praying
to
God
,
to
things
of
a
higher
*NL*
nature
,
I
had
a
great
deal
of
comfort
within
,
which
till
now
I
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
;
also
,
my
health
and
strength
returned
,
I
bestirred
myself
to
*NL*
furnish
myself
with
everything
that
I
wanted
,
and
make
my
way
of
living
*NL*
as
regular
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
4th
of
July
to
the
14th
I
was
chiefly
employed
in
walking
about
*NL*
with
my
gun
in
my
hand
,
a
little
and
a
little
at
a
time
,
as
a
man
that
*NL*
was
gathering
up
his
strength
after
a
fit
of
sickness
;
for
it
is
hardly
*NL*
to
be
imagined
how
low
I
was
,
and
to
what
weakness
I
was
reduced
.
The
*NL*
application
which
I
made
use
of
was
perfectly
new
,
and
perhaps
which
had
*NL*
never
cured
an
ague
before
;
neither
can
I
recommend
it
to
any
to
*NL*
practise
,
by
this
experiment
:
and
though
it
did
carry
off
the
fit
,
yet
it
*NL*
rather
contributed
to
weakening
me
;
for
I
had
frequent
convulsions
in
my
*NL*
nerves
and
limbs
for
some
time
.
I
learned
from
it
also
this
,
in
*NL*
particular
,
that
being
abroad
in
the
rainy
season
was
the
most
pernicious
*NL*
thing
to
my
health
that
could
be
,
especially
in
those
rains
which
came
*NL*
attended
with
storms
and
hurricanes
of
wind
;
for
as
the
rain
which
came
*NL*
in
the
dry
season
was
almost
always
accompanied
with
such
storms
,
so
I
*NL*
found
that
rain
was
much
more
dangerous
than
the
rain
which
fell
in
*NL*
September
and
October
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
AGRICULTURAL
EXPERIENCE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
been
in
this
unhappy
island
above
ten
months
.
All
possibility
*NL*
of
deliverance
from
this
condition
seemed
to
be
entirely
taken
from
me
;
*NL*
and
I
firmly
believe
that
no
human
shape
had
ever
set
foot
upon
that
*NL*
place
.
Having
now
secured
my
habitation
,
as
I
thought
,
fully
to
my
mind
,
*NL*
I
had
a
great
desire
to
make
a
more
perfect
discovery
of
the
island
,
and
*NL*
to
see
what
other
productions
I
might
find
,
which
I
yet
knew
nothing
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
15th
of
July
that
I
began
to
take
a
more
particular
survey
*NL*
of
the
island
itself
.
I
went
up
the
creek
first
,
where
,
as
I
hinted
,
I
*NL*
brought
my
rafts
on
shore
.
I
found
after
I
came
about
two
miles
up
,
that
*NL*
the
tide
did
not
flow
any
higher
,
and
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
little
*NL*
brook
of
running
water
,
very
fresh
and
good
;
but
this
being
the
dry
*NL*
season
,
there
was
hardly
any
water
in
some
parts
of
it
--
at
least
not
*NL*
enough
to
run
in
any
stream
,
so
as
it
could
be
perceived
.
On
the
banks
*NL*
of
this
brook
I
found
many
pleasant
savannahs
or
meadows
,
plain
,
smooth
,
*NL*
and
covered
with
grass
;
and
on
the
rising
parts
of
them
,
next
to
the
*NL*
higher
grounds
,
where
the
water
,
as
might
be
supposed
,
never
overflowed
,
*NL*
I
found
a
great
deal
of
tobacco
,
green
,
and
growing
to
a
great
and
very
*NL*
strong
stalk
.
There
were
divers
other
plants
,
which
I
had
no
notion
of
*NL*
or
understanding
about
,
that
might
,
perhaps
,
have
virtues
of
their
own
,
*NL*
which
I
could
not
find
out
.
I
searched
for
the
cassava
root
,
which
the
*NL*
Indians
,
in
all
that
climate
,
make
their
bread
of
,
but
I
could
find
none
.
*NL*
I
saw
large
plants
of
aloes
,
but
did
not
understand
them
.
I
saw
several
*NL*
sugar-canes
,
but
wild
,
and
,
for
want
of
cultivation
,
imperfect
.
I
*NL*
contented
myself
with
these
discoveries
for
this
time
,
and
came
back
,
*NL*
musing
with
myself
what
course
I
might
take
to
know
the
virtue
and
*NL*
goodness
of
any
of
the
fruits
or
plants
which
I
should
discover
,
but
*NL*
could
bring
it
to
no
conclusion
;
for
,
in
short
,
I
had
made
so
little
*NL*
observation
while
I
was
in
the
Brazils
,
that
I
knew
little
of
the
plants
*NL*
in
the
field
;
at
least
,
very
little
that
might
serve
to
any
purpose
now
*NL*
in
my
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
the
sixteenth
,
I
went
up
the
same
way
again
;
and
after
*NL*
going
something
further
than
I
had
gone
the
day
before
,
I
found
the
brook
*NL*
and
the
savannahs
cease
,
and
the
country
become
more
woody
than
before
.
*NL*
In
this
part
I
found
different
fruits
,
and
particularly
I
found
melons
*NL*
upon
the
ground
,
in
great
abundance
,
and
grapes
upon
the
trees
.
The
*NL*
vines
had
spread
,
indeed
,
over
the
trees
,
and
the
clusters
of
grapes
were
*NL*
just
now
in
their
prime
,
very
ripe
and
rich
.
This
was
a
surprising
*NL*
discovery
,
and
I
was
exceeding
glad
of
them
;
but
I
was
warned
by
my
*NL*
experience
to
eat
sparingly
of
them
;
remembering
that
when
I
was
ashore
*NL*
in
Barbary
,
the
eating
of
grapes
killed
several
of
our
Englishmen
,
who
*NL*
were
slaves
there
,
by
throwing
them
into
fluxes
and
fevers
.
But
I
found
*NL*
an
excellent
use
for
these
grapes
;
and
that
was
,
to
cure
or
dry
them
in
*NL*
the
sun
,
and
keep
them
as
dried
grapes
or
raisins
are
kept
,
which
I
*NL*
thought
would
be
,
as
indeed
they
were
,
wholesome
and
agreeable
to
eat
*NL*
when
no
grapes
could
be
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
spent
all
that
evening
there
,
and
went
not
back
to
my
habitation
;
*NL*
which
,
by
the
way
,
was
the
first
night
,
as
I
might
say
,
I
had
lain
from
*NL*
home
.
In
the
night
,
I
took
my
first
contrivance
,
and
got
up
in
a
tree
,
*NL*
where
I
slept
well
;
and
the
next
morning
proceeded
upon
my
discovery
;
*NL*
travelling
nearly
four
miles
,
as
I
might
judge
by
the
length
of
the
*NL*
valley
,
keeping
still
due
north
,
with
a
ridge
of
hills
on
the
south
and
*NL*
north
side
of
me
.
At
the
end
of
this
march
I
came
to
an
opening
where
*NL*
the
country
seemed
to
descend
to
the
west
;
and
a
little
spring
of
fresh
*NL*
water
,
which
issued
out
of
the
side
of
the
hill
by
me
,
ran
the
other
way
,
*NL*
that
is
,
due
east
;
and
the
country
appeared
so
fresh
,
so
green
,
so
*NL*
flourishing
,
everything
being
in
a
constant
verdure
or
flourish
of
spring
*NL*
that
it
looked
like
a
planted
garden
.
I
descended
a
little
on
the
side
*NL*
of
that
delicious
vale
,
surveying
it
with
a
secret
kind
of
pleasure
,
*NL*
though
mixed
with
my
other
afflicting
thoughts
,
to
think
that
this
was
*NL*
all
my
own
;
that
I
was
king
and
lord
of
all
this
country
indefensibly
,
*NL*
and
had
a
right
of
possession
;
and
if
I
could
convey
it
,
I
might
have
it
*NL*
in
inheritance
as
completely
as
any
lord
of
a
manor
in
England
.
I
saw
*NL*
here
abundance
of
cocoa
trees
,
orange
,
and
lemon
,
and
citron
trees
;
but
*NL*
all
wild
,
and
very
few
bearing
any
fruit
,
at
least
not
then
.
However
,
*NL*
the
green
limes
that
I
gathered
were
not
only
pleasant
to
eat
,
but
very
*NL*
wholesome
;
and
I
mixed
their
juice
afterwards
with
water
,
which
made
it
*NL*
very
wholesome
,
and
very
cool
and
refreshing
.
I
found
now
I
had
business
*NL*
enough
to
gather
and
carry
home
;
and
I
resolved
to
lay
up
a
store
as
well
*NL*
of
grapes
as
limes
and
lemons
,
to
furnish
myself
for
the
wet
season
,
*NL*
which
I
knew
was
approaching
.
In
order
to
do
this
,
I
gathered
a
great
*NL*
heap
of
grapes
in
one
place
,
a
lesser
heap
in
another
place
,
and
a
great
*NL*
parcel
of
limes
and
lemons
in
another
place
;
and
taking
a
few
of
each
*NL*
with
me
,
I
travelled
homewards
;
resolving
to
come
again
,
and
bring
a
bag
*NL*
or
sack
,
or
what
I
could
make
,
to
carry
the
rest
home
.
Accordingly
,
*NL*
having
spent
three
days
in
this
journey
,
I
came
home
-LRB-
so
I
must
now
call
*NL*
my
tent
and
my
cave
-RRB-
;
but
before
I
got
thither
the
grapes
were
spoiled
;
*NL*
the
richness
of
the
fruit
and
the
weight
of
the
juice
having
broken
them
*NL*
and
bruised
them
,
they
were
good
for
little
or
nothing
;
as
to
the
limes
,
*NL*
they
were
good
,
but
I
could
bring
but
a
few
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
being
the
nineteenth
,
I
went
back
,
having
made
me
two
small
*NL*
bags
to
bring
home
my
harvest
;
but
I
was
surprised
,
when
coming
to
my
*NL*
heap
of
grapes
,
which
were
so
rich
and
fine
when
I
gathered
them
,
to
find
*NL*
them
all
spread
about
,
trod
to
pieces
,
and
dragged
about
,
some
here
,
some
*NL*
there
,
and
abundance
eaten
and
devoured
.
By
this
I
concluded
there
were
*NL*
some
wild
creatures
thereabouts
,
which
had
done
this
;
but
what
they
were
*NL*
I
knew
not
.
However
,
as
I
found
there
was
no
laying
them
up
on
heaps
,
*NL*
and
no
carrying
them
away
in
a
sack
,
but
that
one
way
they
would
be
*NL*
destroyed
,
and
the
other
way
they
would
be
crushed
with
their
own
weight
,
*NL*
I
took
another
course
;
for
I
gathered
a
large
quantity
of
the
grapes
,
and
*NL*
hung
upon
the
out-branches
of
the
trees
,
that
they
might
cure
and
dry
in
*NL*
the
sun
;
and
as
for
the
limes
and
lemons
,
I
carried
as
many
back
as
I
*NL*
could
well
stand
under
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
home
from
this
journey
,
I
contemplated
with
great
pleasure
*NL*
the
fruitfulness
of
that
valley
,
and
the
pleasantness
of
the
situation
;
*NL*
the
security
from
storms
on
that
side
of
the
water
,
and
the
wood
:
and
*NL*
concluded
that
I
had
pitched
upon
a
place
to
fix
my
abode
which
was
by
*NL*
far
the
worst
part
of
the
country
.
Upon
the
whole
,
I
began
to
consider
*NL*
of
removing
my
habitation
,
and
looking
out
for
a
place
equally
safe
as
*NL*
where
now
I
was
situate
,
if
possible
,
in
that
pleasant
,
fruitful
part
of
*NL*
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
thought
ran
long
in
my
head
,
and
I
was
exceeding
fond
of
it
for
some
*NL*
time
,
the
pleasantness
of
the
place
tempting
me
;
but
when
I
came
to
a
*NL*
nearer
view
of
it
,
I
considered
that
I
was
now
by
the
seaside
,
where
it
*NL*
was
at
least
possible
that
something
might
happen
to
my
advantage
,
and
,
*NL*
by
the
same
ill
fate
that
brought
me
hither
might
bring
some
other
*NL*
unhappy
wretches
to
the
same
place
;
and
though
it
was
scarce
probable
*NL*
that
any
such
thing
should
ever
happen
,
yet
to
enclose
myself
among
the
*NL*
hills
and
woods
in
the
centre
of
the
island
was
to
anticipate
my
bondage
,
*NL*
and
to
render
such
an
affair
not
only
improbable
,
but
impossible
;
and
*NL*
that
therefore
I
ought
not
by
any
means
to
remove
.
However
,
I
was
so
*NL*
enamoured
of
this
place
,
that
I
spent
much
of
my
time
there
for
the
whole
*NL*
of
the
remaining
part
of
the
month
of
July
;
and
though
upon
second
*NL*
thoughts
,
I
resolved
not
to
remove
,
yet
I
built
me
a
little
kind
of
a
*NL*
bower
,
and
surrounded
it
at
a
distance
with
a
strong
fence
,
being
a
*NL*
double
hedge
,
as
high
as
I
could
reach
,
well
staked
and
filled
between
*NL*
with
brushwood
;
and
here
I
lay
very
secure
,
sometimes
two
or
three
nights
*NL*
together
;
always
going
over
it
with
a
ladder
;
so
that
I
fancied
now
I
had
*NL*
my
country
house
and
my
sea-coast
house
;
and
this
work
took
me
up
to
the
*NL*
beginning
of
August
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
but
newly
finished
my
fence
,
and
began
to
enjoy
my
labour
,
when
the
*NL*
rains
came
on
,
and
made
me
stick
close
to
my
first
habitation
;
for
though
*NL*
I
had
made
me
a
tent
like
the
other
,
with
a
piece
of
a
sail
,
and
spread
*NL*
it
very
well
,
yet
I
had
not
the
shelter
of
a
hill
to
keep
me
from
storms
,
*NL*
nor
a
cave
behind
me
to
retreat
into
when
the
rains
were
extraordinary
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
beginning
of
August
,
as
I
said
,
I
had
finished
my
bower
,
and
*NL*
began
to
enjoy
myself
.
The
3rd
of
August
,
I
found
the
grapes
I
had
hung
*NL*
up
perfectly
dried
,
and
,
indeed
,
were
excellent
good
raisins
of
the
sun
;
*NL*
so
I
began
to
take
them
down
from
the
trees
,
and
it
was
very
happy
that
I
*NL*
did
so
,
for
the
rains
which
followed
would
have
spoiled
them
,
and
I
had
*NL*
lost
the
best
part
of
my
winter
food
;
for
I
had
above
two
hundred
large
*NL*
bunches
of
them
.
No
sooner
had
I
taken
them
all
down
,
and
carried
the
*NL*
most
of
them
home
to
my
cave
,
than
it
began
to
rain
;
and
from
hence
,
*NL*
which
was
the
14th
of
August
,
it
rained
,
more
or
less
,
every
day
till
the
*NL*
middle
of
October
;
and
sometimes
so
violently
,
that
I
could
not
stir
out
*NL*
of
my
cave
for
several
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
season
I
was
much
surprised
with
the
increase
of
my
family
;
I
had
*NL*
been
concerned
for
the
loss
of
one
of
my
cats
,
who
ran
away
from
me
,
or
,
*NL*
as
I
thought
,
had
been
dead
,
and
I
heard
no
more
tidings
of
her
till
,
to
*NL*
my
astonishment
,
she
came
home
about
the
end
of
August
with
three
*NL*
kittens
.
This
was
the
more
strange
to
me
because
,
though
I
had
killed
a
*NL*
wild
cat
,
as
I
called
it
,
with
my
gun
,
yet
I
thought
it
was
quite
a
*NL*
different
kind
from
our
European
cats
;
but
the
young
cats
were
the
same
*NL*
kind
of
house-breed
as
the
old
one
;
and
both
my
cats
being
females
,
I
*NL*
thought
it
very
strange
.
But
from
these
three
cats
I
afterwards
came
to
*NL*
be
so
pestered
with
cats
that
I
was
forced
to
kill
them
like
vermin
or
*NL*
wild
beasts
,
and
to
drive
them
from
my
house
as
much
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
14th
of
August
to
the
26th
,
incessant
rain
,
so
that
I
could
not
*NL*
stir
,
and
was
now
very
careful
not
to
be
much
wet
.
In
this
confinement
,
*NL*
I
began
to
be
straitened
for
food
:
but
venturing
out
twice
,
I
one
day
*NL*
killed
a
goat
;
and
the
last
day
,
which
was
the
26th
,
found
a
very
large
*NL*
tortoise
,
which
was
a
treat
to
me
,
and
my
food
was
regulated
thus
:
I
ate
*NL*
a
bunch
of
raisins
for
my
breakfast
;
a
piece
of
the
goat
's
flesh
,
or
of
*NL*
the
turtle
,
for
my
dinner
,
broiled
--
for
,
to
my
great
misfortune
,
I
had
no
*NL*
vessel
to
boil
or
stew
anything
;
and
two
or
three
of
the
turtle
's
eggs
*NL*
for
my
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
confinement
in
my
cover
by
the
rain
,
I
worked
daily
two
or
*NL*
three
hours
at
enlarging
my
cave
,
and
by
degrees
worked
it
on
towards
one
*NL*
side
,
till
I
came
to
the
outside
of
the
hill
,
and
made
a
door
or
way
out
,
*NL*
which
came
beyond
my
fence
or
wall
;
and
so
I
came
in
and
out
this
way
.
*NL*
But
I
was
not
perfectly
easy
at
lying
so
open
;
for
,
as
I
had
managed
*NL*
myself
before
,
I
was
in
a
perfect
enclosure
;
whereas
now
I
thought
I
lay
*NL*
exposed
,
and
open
for
anything
to
come
in
upon
me
;
and
yet
I
could
not
*NL*
perceive
that
there
was
any
living
thing
to
fear
,
the
biggest
creature
*NL*
that
I
had
yet
seen
upon
the
island
being
a
goat
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Sept.
_
30
.
--
I
was
now
come
to
the
unhappy
anniversary
of
my
landing
.
I
*NL*
cast
up
the
notches
on
my
post
,
and
found
I
had
been
on
shore
three
*NL*
hundred
and
sixty-five
days
.
I
kept
this
day
as
a
solemn
fast
,
setting
*NL*
it
apart
for
religious
exercise
,
prostrating
myself
on
the
ground
with
*NL*
the
most
serious
humiliation
,
confessing
my
sins
to
God
,
acknowledging
*NL*
His
righteous
judgments
upon
me
,
and
praying
to
Him
to
have
mercy
on
me
*NL*
through
Jesus
Christ
;
and
not
having
tasted
the
least
refreshment
for
*NL*
twelve
hours
,
even
till
the
going
down
of
the
sun
,
I
then
ate
a
*NL*
biscuit-cake
and
a
bunch
of
grapes
,
and
went
to
bed
,
finishing
the
day
as
*NL*
I
began
it
.
I
had
all
this
time
observed
no
Sabbath
day
;
for
as
at
first
*NL*
I
had
no
sense
of
religion
upon
my
mind
,
I
had
,
after
some
time
,
omitted
*NL*
to
distinguish
the
weeks
,
by
making
a
longer
notch
than
ordinary
for
the
*NL*
Sabbath
day
,
and
so
did
not
really
know
what
any
of
the
days
were
;
but
*NL*
now
,
having
cast
up
the
days
as
above
,
I
found
I
had
been
there
a
year
;
*NL*
so
I
divided
it
into
weeks
,
and
set
apart
every
seventh
day
for
a
*NL*
Sabbath
;
though
I
found
at
the
end
of
my
account
I
had
lost
a
day
or
two
*NL*
in
my
reckoning
.
A
little
after
this
,
my
ink
began
to
fail
me
,
and
so
I
*NL*
contented
myself
to
use
it
more
sparingly
,
and
to
write
down
only
the
*NL*
most
remarkable
events
of
my
life
,
without
continuing
a
daily
memorandum
*NL*
of
other
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rainy
season
and
the
dry
season
began
now
to
appear
regular
to
me
,
*NL*
and
I
learned
to
divide
them
so
as
to
provide
for
them
accordingly
;
but
I
*NL*
bought
all
my
experience
before
I
had
it
,
and
this
I
am
going
to
relate
*NL*
was
one
of
the
most
discouraging
experiments
that
I
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
that
I
had
saved
the
few
ears
of
barley
and
rice
,
which
*NL*
I
had
so
surprisingly
found
spring
up
,
as
I
thought
,
of
themselves
,
and
I
*NL*
believe
there
were
about
thirty
stalks
of
rice
,
and
about
twenty
of
*NL*
barley
;
and
now
I
thought
it
a
proper
time
to
sow
it
,
after
the
rains
,
*NL*
the
sun
being
in
its
southern
position
,
going
from
me
.
Accordingly
,
I
*NL*
dug
up
a
piece
of
ground
as
well
as
I
could
with
my
wooden
spade
,
and
*NL*
dividing
it
into
two
parts
,
I
sowed
my
grain
;
but
as
I
was
sowing
,
it
*NL*
casually
occurred
to
my
thoughts
that
I
would
not
sow
it
all
at
first
,
*NL*
because
I
did
not
know
when
was
the
proper
time
for
it
,
so
I
sowed
about
*NL*
two-thirds
of
the
seed
,
leaving
about
a
handful
of
each
.
It
was
a
great
*NL*
comfort
to
me
afterwards
that
I
did
so
,
for
not
one
grain
of
what
I
sowed
*NL*
this
time
came
to
anything
:
for
the
dry
months
following
,
the
earth
*NL*
having
had
no
rain
after
the
seed
was
sown
,
it
had
no
moisture
to
assist
*NL*
its
growth
,
and
never
came
up
at
all
till
the
wet
season
had
come
again
,
*NL*
and
then
it
grew
as
if
it
had
been
but
newly
sown
.
Finding
my
first
seed
*NL*
did
not
grow
,
which
I
easily
imagined
was
by
the
drought
,
I
sought
for
a
*NL*
moister
piece
of
ground
to
make
another
trial
in
,
and
I
dug
up
a
piece
of
*NL*
ground
near
my
new
bower
,
and
sowed
the
rest
of
my
seed
in
February
,
a
*NL*
little
before
the
vernal
equinox
;
and
this
having
the
rainy
months
of
*NL*
March
and
April
to
water
it
,
sprung
up
very
pleasantly
,
and
yielded
a
*NL*
very
good
crop
;
but
having
part
of
the
seed
left
only
,
and
not
daring
to
*NL*
sow
all
that
I
had
,
I
had
but
a
small
quantity
at
last
,
my
whole
crop
not
*NL*
amounting
to
above
half
a
peck
of
each
kind
.
But
by
this
experiment
I
*NL*
was
made
master
of
my
business
,
and
knew
exactly
when
the
proper
season
*NL*
was
to
sow
,
and
that
I
might
expect
two
seed-times
and
two
harvests
every
*NL*
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
corn
was
growing
I
made
a
little
discovery
,
which
was
of
use
*NL*
to
me
afterwards
.
As
soon
as
the
rains
were
over
,
and
the
weather
began
*NL*
to
settle
,
which
was
about
the
month
of
November
,
I
made
a
visit
up
the
*NL*
country
to
my
bower
,
where
,
though
I
had
not
been
some
months
,
yet
I
*NL*
found
all
things
just
as
I
left
them
.
The
circle
or
double
hedge
that
I
*NL*
had
made
was
not
only
firm
and
entire
,
but
the
stakes
which
I
had
cut
out
*NL*
of
some
trees
that
grew
thereabouts
were
all
shot
out
and
grown
with
long
*NL*
branches
,
as
much
as
a
willow-tree
usually
shoots
the
first
year
after
*NL*
lopping
its
head
.
I
could
not
tell
what
tree
to
call
it
that
these
*NL*
stakes
were
cut
from
.
I
was
surprised
,
and
yet
very
well
pleased
,
to
see
*NL*
the
young
trees
grow
;
and
I
pruned
them
,
and
led
them
up
to
grow
as
much
*NL*
alike
as
I
could
;
and
it
is
scarce
credible
how
beautiful
a
figure
they
*NL*
grew
into
in
three
years
;
so
that
though
the
hedge
made
a
circle
of
about
*NL*
twenty-five
yards
in
diameter
,
yet
the
trees
,
for
such
I
might
now
call
*NL*
them
,
soon
covered
it
,
and
it
was
a
complete
shade
,
sufficient
to
lodge
*NL*
under
all
the
dry
season
.
This
made
me
resolve
to
cut
some
more
stakes
,
*NL*
and
make
me
a
hedge
like
this
,
in
a
semi-circle
round
my
wall
-LRB-
I
mean
*NL*
that
of
my
first
dwelling
-RRB-
,
which
I
did
;
and
placing
the
trees
or
stakes
*NL*
in
a
double
row
,
at
about
eight
yards
distance
from
my
first
fence
,
they
*NL*
grew
presently
,
and
were
at
first
a
fine
cover
to
my
habitation
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
served
for
a
defence
also
,
as
I
shall
observe
in
its
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
now
that
the
seasons
of
the
year
might
generally
be
divided
,
not
*NL*
into
summer
and
winter
,
as
in
Europe
,
but
into
the
rainy
seasons
and
the
*NL*
dry
seasons
,
which
were
generally
thus
:
--
The
half
of
February
,
the
whole
*NL*
of
March
,
and
the
half
of
April
--
rainy
,
the
sun
being
then
on
or
near
the
*NL*
equinox
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
half
of
April
,
the
whole
of
May
,
June
,
and
July
,
and
the
half
of
*NL*
August
--
dry
,
the
sun
being
then
to
the
north
of
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
half
of
August
,
the
whole
of
September
,
and
the
half
of
*NL*
October
--
rainy
,
the
sun
being
then
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
half
of
October
,
the
whole
of
November
,
December
,
and
January
,
and
*NL*
the
half
of
February
--
dry
,
the
sun
being
then
to
the
south
of
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rainy
seasons
sometimes
held
longer
or
shorter
as
the
winds
happened
*NL*
to
blow
,
but
this
was
the
general
observation
I
made
.
After
I
had
found
*NL*
by
experience
the
ill
consequences
of
being
abroad
in
the
rain
,
I
took
*NL*
care
to
furnish
myself
with
provisions
beforehand
,
that
I
might
not
be
*NL*
obliged
to
go
out
,
and
I
sat
within
doors
as
much
as
possible
during
the
*NL*
wet
months
.
This
time
I
found
much
employment
,
and
very
suitable
also
to
*NL*
the
time
,
for
I
found
great
occasion
for
many
things
which
I
had
no
way
*NL*
to
furnish
myself
with
but
by
hard
labour
and
constant
application
;
*NL*
particularly
I
tried
many
ways
to
make
myself
a
basket
,
but
all
the
twigs
*NL*
I
could
get
for
the
purpose
proved
so
brittle
that
they
would
do
nothing
.
*NL*
It
proved
of
excellent
advantage
to
me
now
,
that
when
I
was
a
boy
,
I
used
*NL*
to
take
great
delight
in
standing
at
a
basket-maker
's
,
in
the
town
where
*NL*
my
father
lived
,
to
see
them
make
their
wicker-ware
;
and
being
,
as
boys
*NL*
usually
are
,
very
officious
to
help
,
and
a
great
observer
of
the
manner
*NL*
in
which
they
worked
those
things
,
and
sometimes
lending
a
hand
,
I
had
by
*NL*
these
means
full
knowledge
of
the
methods
of
it
,
and
I
wanted
nothing
but
*NL*
the
materials
,
when
it
came
into
my
mind
that
the
twigs
of
that
tree
from
*NL*
whence
I
cut
my
stakes
that
grew
might
possibly
be
as
tough
as
the
*NL*
sallows
,
willows
,
and
osiers
in
England
,
and
I
resolved
to
try
.
*NL*
Accordingly
,
the
next
day
I
went
to
my
country
house
,
as
I
called
it
,
and
*NL*
cutting
some
of
the
smaller
twigs
,
I
found
them
to
my
purpose
as
much
as
*NL*
I
could
desire
;
whereupon
I
came
the
next
time
prepared
with
a
hatchet
to
*NL*
cut
down
a
quantity
,
which
I
soon
found
,
for
there
was
great
plenty
of
*NL*
them
.
These
I
set
up
to
dry
within
my
circle
or
hedge
,
and
when
they
*NL*
were
fit
for
use
I
carried
them
to
my
cave
;
and
here
,
during
the
next
*NL*
season
,
I
employed
myself
in
making
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
a
great
many
*NL*
baskets
,
both
to
carry
earth
or
to
carry
or
lay
up
anything
,
as
I
had
*NL*
occasion
;
and
though
I
did
not
finish
them
very
handsomely
,
yet
I
made
*NL*
them
sufficiently
serviceable
for
my
purpose
;
thus
,
afterwards
,
I
took
*NL*
care
never
to
be
without
them
;
and
as
my
wicker-ware
decayed
,
I
made
*NL*
more
,
especially
strong
,
deep
baskets
to
place
my
corn
in
,
instead
of
*NL*
sacks
,
when
I
should
come
to
have
any
quantity
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
mastered
this
difficulty
,
and
employed
a
world
of
time
about
it
,
I
*NL*
bestirred
myself
to
see
,
if
possible
,
how
to
supply
two
wants
.
I
had
no
*NL*
vessels
to
hold
anything
that
was
liquid
,
except
two
runlets
,
which
were
*NL*
almost
full
of
rum
,
and
some
glass
bottles
--
some
of
the
common
size
,
and
*NL*
others
which
were
case
bottles
,
square
,
for
the
holding
of
water
,
*NL*
spirits
,
&
c.
I
had
not
so
much
as
a
pot
to
boil
anything
,
except
a
great
*NL*
kettle
,
which
I
saved
out
of
the
ship
,
and
which
was
too
big
for
such
as
*NL*
I
desired
it
--
viz
.
to
make
broth
,
and
stew
a
bit
of
meat
by
itself
.
The
*NL*
second
thing
I
fain
would
have
had
was
a
tobacco-pipe
,
but
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
me
to
make
one
;
however
,
I
found
a
contrivance
for
that
,
*NL*
too
,
at
last
.
I
employed
myself
in
planting
my
second
rows
of
stakes
or
*NL*
piles
,
and
in
this
wicker-working
all
the
summer
or
dry
season
,
when
*NL*
another
business
took
me
up
more
time
than
it
could
be
imagined
I
could
*NL*
spare
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
SURVEYS
HIS
POSITION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
mentioned
before
that
I
had
a
great
mind
to
see
the
whole
island
,
and
*NL*
that
I
had
travelled
up
the
brook
,
and
so
on
to
where
I
built
my
bower
,
*NL*
and
where
I
had
an
opening
quite
to
the
sea
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
island
.
I
now
resolved
to
travel
quite
across
to
the
sea-shore
on
that
*NL*
side
;
so
,
taking
my
gun
,
a
hatchet
,
and
my
dog
,
and
a
larger
quantity
of
*NL*
powder
and
shot
than
usual
,
with
two
biscuit-cakes
and
a
great
bunch
of
*NL*
raisins
in
my
pouch
for
my
store
,
I
began
my
journey
.
When
I
had
passed
*NL*
the
vale
where
my
bower
stood
,
as
above
,
I
came
within
view
of
the
sea
to
*NL*
the
west
,
and
it
being
a
very
clear
day
,
I
fairly
descried
land
--
whether
*NL*
an
island
or
a
continent
I
could
not
tell
;
but
it
lay
very
high
,
*NL*
extending
from
the
W.
to
the
W.S.W.
at
a
very
great
distance
;
by
my
guess
*NL*
it
could
not
be
less
than
fifteen
or
twenty
leagues
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
tell
what
part
of
the
world
this
might
be
,
otherwise
than
*NL*
that
I
knew
it
must
be
part
of
America
,
and
,
as
I
concluded
by
all
my
*NL*
observations
,
must
be
near
the
Spanish
dominions
,
and
perhaps
was
all
*NL*
inhabited
by
savages
,
where
,
if
I
had
landed
,
I
had
been
in
a
worse
*NL*
condition
than
I
was
now
;
and
therefore
I
acquiesced
in
the
dispositions
*NL*
of
Providence
,
which
I
began
now
to
own
and
to
believe
ordered
everything
*NL*
for
the
best
;
I
say
I
quieted
my
mind
with
this
,
and
left
off
afflicting
*NL*
myself
with
fruitless
wishes
of
being
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
after
some
thought
upon
this
affair
,
I
considered
that
if
this
*NL*
land
was
the
Spanish
coast
,
I
should
certainly
,
one
time
or
other
,
see
*NL*
some
vessel
pass
or
repass
one
way
or
other
;
but
if
not
,
then
it
was
the
*NL*
savage
coast
between
the
Spanish
country
and
Brazils
,
where
are
found
the
*NL*
worst
of
savages
;
for
they
are
cannibals
or
men-eaters
,
and
fail
not
to
*NL*
murder
and
devour
all
the
human
bodies
that
fall
into
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
considerations
,
I
walked
very
leisurely
forward
.
I
found
that
*NL*
side
of
the
island
where
I
now
was
much
pleasanter
than
mine
--
the
open
or
*NL*
savannah
fields
sweet
,
adorned
with
flowers
and
grass
,
and
full
of
very
*NL*
fine
woods
.
I
saw
abundance
of
parrots
,
and
fain
I
would
have
caught
*NL*
one
,
if
possible
,
to
have
kept
it
to
be
tame
,
and
taught
it
to
speak
to
*NL*
me
.
I
did
,
after
some
painstaking
,
catch
a
young
parrot
,
for
I
knocked
*NL*
it
down
with
a
stick
,
and
having
recovered
it
,
I
brought
it
home
;
but
it
*NL*
was
some
years
before
I
could
make
him
speak
;
however
,
at
last
I
taught
*NL*
him
to
call
me
by
name
very
familiarly
.
But
the
accident
that
followed
,
*NL*
though
it
be
a
trifle
,
will
be
very
diverting
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
exceedingly
diverted
with
this
journey
.
I
found
in
the
low
grounds
*NL*
hares
-LRB-
as
I
thought
them
to
be
-RRB-
and
foxes
;
but
they
differed
greatly
from
*NL*
all
the
other
kinds
I
had
met
with
,
nor
could
I
satisfy
myself
to
eat
*NL*
them
,
though
I
killed
several
.
But
I
had
no
need
to
be
venturous
,
for
I
*NL*
had
no
want
of
food
,
and
of
that
which
was
very
good
too
,
especially
*NL*
these
three
sorts
,
viz
.
goats
,
pigeons
,
and
turtle
,
or
tortoise
,
which
*NL*
added
to
my
grapes
,
Leadenhall
market
could
not
have
furnished
a
table
*NL*
better
than
I
,
in
proportion
to
the
company
;
and
though
my
case
was
*NL*
deplorable
enough
,
yet
I
had
great
cause
for
thankfulness
that
I
was
not
*NL*
driven
to
any
extremities
for
food
,
but
had
rather
plenty
,
even
to
*NL*
dainties
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
travelled
in
this
journey
above
two
miles
outright
in
a
day
,
or
*NL*
thereabouts
;
but
I
took
so
many
turns
and
re-turns
to
see
what
*NL*
discoveries
I
could
make
,
that
I
came
weary
enough
to
the
place
where
I
*NL*
resolved
to
sit
down
all
night
;
and
then
I
either
reposed
myself
in
a
*NL*
tree
,
or
surrounded
myself
with
a
row
of
stakes
set
upright
in
the
*NL*
ground
,
either
from
one
tree
to
another
,
or
so
as
no
wild
creature
could
*NL*
come
at
me
without
waking
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
came
to
the
sea-shore
,
I
was
surprised
to
see
that
I
had
*NL*
taken
up
my
lot
on
the
worst
side
of
the
island
,
for
here
,
indeed
,
the
*NL*
shore
was
covered
with
innumerable
turtles
,
whereas
on
the
other
side
I
*NL*
had
found
but
three
in
a
year
and
a
half
.
Here
was
also
an
infinite
*NL*
number
of
fowls
of
many
kinds
,
some
which
I
had
seen
,
and
some
which
I
*NL*
had
not
seen
before
,
and
many
of
them
very
good
meat
,
but
such
as
I
knew
*NL*
not
the
names
of
,
except
those
called
penguins
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
have
shot
as
many
as
I
pleased
,
but
was
very
sparing
of
my
powder
*NL*
and
shot
,
and
therefore
had
more
mind
to
kill
a
she-goat
if
I
could
,
*NL*
which
I
could
better
feed
on
;
and
though
there
were
many
goats
here
,
more
*NL*
than
on
my
side
the
island
,
yet
it
was
with
much
more
difficulty
that
I
*NL*
could
come
near
them
,
the
country
being
flat
and
even
,
and
they
saw
me
*NL*
much
sooner
than
when
I
was
on
the
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
this
side
of
the
country
was
much
pleasanter
than
mine
;
but
yet
*NL*
I
had
not
the
least
inclination
to
remove
,
for
as
I
was
fixed
in
my
*NL*
habitation
it
became
natural
to
me
,
and
I
seemed
all
the
while
I
was
here
*NL*
to
be
as
it
were
upon
a
journey
,
and
from
home
.
However
,
I
travelled
*NL*
along
the
shore
of
the
sea
towards
the
east
,
I
suppose
about
twelve
*NL*
miles
,
and
then
setting
up
a
great
pole
upon
the
shore
for
a
mark
,
I
*NL*
concluded
I
would
go
home
again
,
and
that
the
next
journey
I
took
should
*NL*
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
east
from
my
dwelling
,
and
so
round
*NL*
till
I
came
to
my
post
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
another
way
to
come
back
than
that
I
went
,
thinking
I
could
easily
*NL*
keep
all
the
island
so
much
in
my
view
that
I
could
not
miss
finding
my
*NL*
first
dwelling
by
viewing
the
country
;
but
I
found
myself
mistaken
,
for
*NL*
being
come
about
two
or
three
miles
,
I
found
myself
descended
into
a
very
*NL*
large
valley
,
but
so
surrounded
with
hills
,
and
those
hills
covered
with
*NL*
wood
,
that
I
could
not
see
which
was
my
way
by
any
direction
but
that
of
*NL*
the
sun
,
nor
even
then
,
unless
I
knew
very
well
the
position
of
the
sun
*NL*
at
that
time
of
the
day
.
It
happened
,
to
my
further
misfortune
,
that
the
*NL*
weather
proved
hazy
for
three
or
four
days
while
I
was
in
the
valley
,
and
*NL*
not
being
able
to
see
the
sun
,
I
wandered
about
very
uncomfortably
,
and
*NL*
at
last
was
obliged
to
find
the
seaside
,
look
for
my
post
,
and
come
back
*NL*
the
same
way
I
went
:
and
then
,
by
easy
journeys
,
I
turned
homeward
,
the
*NL*
weather
being
exceeding
hot
,
and
my
gun
,
ammunition
,
hatchet
,
and
other
*NL*
things
very
heavy
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
journey
my
dog
surprised
a
young
kid
,
and
seized
upon
it
;
and
I
,
*NL*
running
in
to
take
hold
of
it
,
caught
it
,
and
saved
it
alive
from
the
*NL*
dog
.
I
had
a
great
mind
to
bring
it
home
if
I
could
,
for
I
had
often
*NL*
been
musing
whether
it
might
not
be
possible
to
get
a
kid
or
two
,
and
so
*NL*
raise
a
breed
of
tame
goats
,
which
might
supply
me
when
my
powder
and
*NL*
shot
should
be
all
spent
.
I
made
a
collar
for
this
little
creature
,
and
*NL*
with
a
string
,
which
I
made
of
some
rope-yam
,
which
I
always
carried
*NL*
about
me
,
I
led
him
along
,
though
with
some
difficulty
,
till
I
came
to
my
*NL*
bower
,
and
there
I
enclosed
him
and
left
him
,
for
I
was
very
impatient
to
*NL*
be
at
home
,
from
whence
I
had
been
absent
above
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
express
what
a
satisfaction
it
was
to
me
to
come
into
my
old
*NL*
hutch
,
and
lie
down
in
my
hammock-bed
.
This
little
wandering
journey
,
*NL*
without
settled
place
of
abode
,
had
been
so
unpleasant
to
me
,
that
my
own
*NL*
house
,
as
I
called
it
to
myself
,
was
a
perfect
settlement
to
me
compared
*NL*
to
that
;
and
it
rendered
everything
about
me
so
comfortable
,
that
I
*NL*
resolved
I
would
never
go
a
great
way
from
it
again
while
it
should
be
my
*NL*
lot
to
stay
on
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
reposed
myself
here
a
week
,
to
rest
and
regale
myself
after
my
long
*NL*
journey
;
during
which
most
of
the
time
was
taken
up
in
the
weighty
affair
*NL*
of
making
a
cage
for
my
Poll
,
who
began
now
to
be
a
mere
domestic
,
and
to
*NL*
be
well
acquainted
with
me
.
Then
I
began
to
think
of
the
poor
kid
which
*NL*
I
had
penned
in
within
my
little
circle
,
and
resolved
to
go
and
fetch
it
*NL*
home
,
or
give
it
some
food
;
accordingly
I
went
,
and
found
it
where
I
left
*NL*
it
,
for
indeed
it
could
not
get
out
,
but
was
almost
starved
for
want
of
*NL*
food
.
I
went
and
cut
boughs
of
trees
,
and
branches
of
such
shrubs
as
I
*NL*
could
find
,
and
threw
it
over
,
and
having
fed
it
,
I
tied
it
as
I
did
*NL*
before
,
to
lead
it
away
;
but
it
was
so
tame
with
being
hungry
,
that
I
had
*NL*
no
need
to
have
tied
it
,
for
it
followed
me
like
a
dog
:
and
as
I
*NL*
continually
fed
it
,
the
creature
became
so
loving
,
so
gentle
,
and
so
*NL*
fond
,
that
it
became
from
that
time
one
of
my
domestics
also
,
and
would
*NL*
never
leave
me
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rainy
season
of
the
autumnal
equinox
was
now
come
,
and
I
kept
the
*NL*
30th
of
September
in
the
same
solemn
manner
as
before
,
being
the
*NL*
anniversary
of
my
landing
on
the
island
,
having
now
been
there
two
years
,
*NL*
and
no
more
prospect
of
being
delivered
than
the
first
day
I
came
there
,
*NL*
I
spent
the
whole
day
in
humble
and
thankful
acknowledgments
of
the
many
*NL*
wonderful
mercies
which
my
solitary
condition
was
attended
with
,
and
*NL*
without
which
it
might
have
been
infinitely
more
miserable
.
I
gave
*NL*
humble
and
hearty
thanks
that
God
had
been
pleased
to
discover
to
me
that
*NL*
it
was
possible
I
might
be
more
happy
in
this
solitary
condition
than
I
*NL*
should
have
been
in
the
liberty
of
society
,
and
in
all
the
pleasures
of
*NL*
the
world
;
that
He
could
fully
make
up
to
me
the
deficiencies
of
my
*NL*
solitary
state
,
and
the
want
of
human
society
,
by
His
presence
and
the
*NL*
communications
of
His
grace
to
my
soul
;
supporting
,
comforting
,
and
*NL*
encouraging
me
to
depend
upon
His
providence
here
,
and
hope
for
His
*NL*
eternal
presence
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
that
I
began
sensibly
to
feel
how
much
more
happy
this
life
I
*NL*
now
led
was
,
with
all
its
miserable
circumstances
,
than
the
wicked
,
*NL*
cursed
,
abominable
life
I
led
all
the
past
part
of
my
days
;
and
now
I
*NL*
changed
both
my
sorrows
and
my
joys
;
my
very
desires
altered
,
my
*NL*
affections
changed
their
gusts
,
and
my
delights
were
perfectly
new
from
*NL*
what
they
were
at
my
first
coming
,
or
,
indeed
,
for
the
two
years
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
,
as
I
walked
about
,
either
on
my
hunting
or
for
viewing
the
*NL*
country
,
the
anguish
of
my
soul
at
my
condition
would
break
out
upon
me
*NL*
on
a
sudden
,
and
my
very
heart
would
die
within
me
,
to
think
of
the
*NL*
woods
,
the
mountains
,
the
deserts
I
was
in
,
and
how
I
was
a
prisoner
,
*NL*
locked
up
with
the
eternal
bars
and
bolts
of
the
ocean
,
in
an
uninhabited
*NL*
wilderness
,
without
redemption
.
In
the
midst
of
the
greatest
composure
*NL*
of
my
mind
,
this
would
break
out
upon
me
like
a
storm
,
and
make
me
wring
*NL*
my
hands
and
weep
like
a
child
.
Sometimes
it
would
take
me
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
my
work
,
and
I
would
immediately
sit
down
and
sigh
,
and
look
upon
the
*NL*
ground
for
an
hour
or
two
together
;
and
this
was
still
worse
to
me
,
for
*NL*
if
I
could
burst
out
into
tears
,
or
vent
myself
by
words
,
it
would
go
*NL*
off
,
and
the
grief
,
having
exhausted
itself
,
would
abate
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
I
began
to
exercise
myself
with
new
thoughts
:
I
daily
read
the
*NL*
word
of
God
,
and
applied
all
the
comforts
of
it
to
my
present
state
.
One
*NL*
morning
,
being
very
sad
,
I
opened
the
Bible
upon
these
words
,
``
I
will
*NL*
never
,
never
leave
thee
,
nor
forsake
thee
.
''
Immediately
it
occurred
that
*NL*
these
words
were
to
me
;
why
else
should
they
be
directed
in
such
a
*NL*
manner
,
just
at
the
moment
when
I
was
mourning
over
my
condition
,
as
one
*NL*
forsaken
of
God
and
man
?
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
God
does
not
forsake
*NL*
me
,
of
what
ill
consequence
can
it
be
,
or
what
matters
it
,
though
the
*NL*
world
should
all
forsake
me
,
seeing
on
the
other
hand
,
if
I
had
all
the
*NL*
world
,
and
should
lose
the
favour
and
blessing
of
God
,
there
would
be
no
*NL*
comparison
in
the
loss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
moment
I
began
to
conclude
in
my
mind
that
it
was
possible
for
*NL*
me
to
be
more
happy
in
this
forsaken
,
solitary
condition
than
it
was
*NL*
probable
I
should
ever
have
been
in
any
other
particular
state
in
the
*NL*
world
;
and
with
this
thought
I
was
going
to
give
thanks
to
God
for
*NL*
bringing
me
to
this
place
.
I
know
not
what
it
was
,
but
something
shocked
*NL*
my
mind
at
that
thought
,
and
I
durst
not
speak
the
words
.
``
How
canst
*NL*
thou
become
such
a
hypocrite
,
''
said
I
,
even
audibly
,
``
to
pretend
to
be
*NL*
thankful
for
a
condition
which
,
however
thou
mayest
endeavour
to
be
*NL*
contented
with
,
thou
wouldst
rather
pray
heartily
to
be
delivered
from
?
''
*NL*
So
I
stopped
there
;
but
though
I
could
not
say
I
thanked
God
for
being
*NL*
there
,
yet
I
sincerely
gave
thanks
to
God
for
opening
my
eyes
,
by
*NL*
whatever
afflicting
providences
,
to
see
the
former
condition
of
my
life
,
*NL*
and
to
mourn
for
my
wickedness
,
and
repent
.
I
never
opened
the
Bible
,
or
*NL*
shut
it
,
but
my
very
soul
within
me
blessed
God
for
directing
my
friend
*NL*
in
England
,
without
any
order
of
mine
,
to
pack
it
up
among
my
goods
,
and
*NL*
for
assisting
me
afterwards
to
save
it
out
of
the
wreck
of
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
and
in
this
disposition
of
mind
,
I
began
my
third
year
;
and
though
*NL*
I
have
not
given
the
reader
the
trouble
of
so
particular
an
account
of
my
*NL*
works
this
year
as
the
first
,
yet
in
general
it
may
be
observed
that
I
*NL*
was
very
seldom
idle
,
but
having
regularly
divided
my
time
according
to
*NL*
the
several
daily
employments
that
were
before
me
,
such
as
:
first
,
my
*NL*
duty
to
God
,
and
the
reading
the
Scriptures
,
which
I
constantly
set
apart
*NL*
some
time
for
thrice
every
day
;
secondly
,
the
going
abroad
with
my
gun
*NL*
for
food
,
which
generally
took
me
up
three
hours
in
every
morning
,
when
*NL*
it
did
not
rain
;
thirdly
,
the
ordering
,
cutting
,
preserving
,
and
cooking
*NL*
what
I
had
killed
or
caught
for
my
supply
;
these
took
up
great
part
of
*NL*
the
day
.
Also
,
it
is
to
be
considered
,
that
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
*NL*
when
the
sun
was
in
the
zenith
,
the
violence
of
the
heat
was
too
great
to
*NL*
stir
out
;
so
that
about
four
hours
in
the
evening
was
all
the
time
I
*NL*
could
be
supposed
to
work
in
,
with
this
exception
,
that
sometimes
I
*NL*
changed
my
hours
of
hunting
and
working
,
and
went
to
work
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
and
abroad
with
my
gun
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
short
time
allowed
for
labour
I
desire
may
be
added
the
exceeding
*NL*
laboriousness
of
my
work
;
the
many
hours
which
,
for
want
of
tools
,
want
*NL*
of
help
,
and
want
of
skill
,
everything
I
did
took
up
out
of
my
time
.
For
*NL*
example
,
I
was
full
two
and
forty
days
in
making
a
board
for
a
long
*NL*
shelf
,
which
I
wanted
in
my
cave
;
whereas
,
two
sawyers
,
with
their
tools
*NL*
and
a
saw-pit
,
would
have
cut
six
of
them
out
of
the
same
tree
in
half
a
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
case
was
this
:
it
was
to
be
a
large
tree
which
was
to
be
cut
down
,
*NL*
because
my
board
was
to
be
a
broad
one
.
This
tree
I
was
three
days
in
*NL*
cutting
down
,
and
two
more
cutting
off
the
boughs
,
and
reducing
it
to
a
*NL*
log
or
piece
of
timber
.
With
inexpressible
hacking
and
hewing
I
reduced
*NL*
both
the
sides
of
it
into
chips
till
it
began
to
be
light
enough
to
move
;
*NL*
then
I
turned
it
,
and
made
one
side
of
it
smooth
and
flat
as
a
board
from
*NL*
end
to
end
;
then
,
turning
that
side
downward
,
cut
the
other
side
til
I
*NL*
brought
the
plank
to
be
about
three
inches
thick
,
and
smooth
on
both
*NL*
sides
.
Any
one
may
judge
the
labour
of
my
hands
in
such
a
piece
of
work
;
*NL*
but
labour
and
patience
carried
me
through
that
,
and
many
other
things
.
*NL*
I
only
observe
this
in
particular
,
to
show
the
reason
why
so
much
of
my
*NL*
time
went
away
with
so
little
work
--
viz
.
that
what
might
be
a
little
to
*NL*
be
done
with
help
and
tools
,
was
a
vast
labour
and
required
a
prodigious
*NL*
time
to
do
alone
,
and
by
hand
.
But
notwithstanding
this
,
with
patience
*NL*
and
labour
I
got
through
everything
that
my
circumstances
made
necessary
*NL*
to
me
to
do
,
as
will
appear
by
what
follows
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
,
in
the
months
of
November
and
December
,
expecting
my
crop
of
*NL*
barley
and
rice
.
The
ground
I
had
manured
and
dug
up
for
them
was
not
*NL*
great
;
for
,
as
I
observed
,
my
seed
of
each
was
not
above
the
quantity
of
*NL*
half
a
peck
,
for
I
had
lost
one
whole
crop
by
sowing
in
the
dry
season
.
*NL*
But
now
my
crop
promised
very
well
,
when
on
a
sudden
I
found
I
was
in
*NL*
danger
of
losing
it
all
again
by
enemies
of
several
sorts
,
which
it
was
*NL*
scarcely
possible
to
keep
from
it
;
as
,
first
,
the
goats
,
and
wild
*NL*
creatures
which
I
called
hares
,
who
,
tasting
the
sweetness
of
the
blade
,
*NL*
lay
in
it
night
and
day
,
as
soon
as
it
came
up
,
and
eat
it
so
close
,
that
*NL*
it
could
get
no
time
to
shoot
up
into
stalk
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
saw
no
remedy
for
but
by
making
an
enclosure
about
it
with
a
*NL*
hedge
;
which
I
did
with
a
great
deal
of
toil
,
and
the
more
,
because
it
*NL*
required
speed
.
However
,
as
my
arable
land
was
but
small
,
suited
to
my
*NL*
crop
,
I
got
it
totally
well
fenced
in
about
three
weeks
'
time
;
and
*NL*
shooting
some
of
the
creatures
in
the
daytime
,
I
set
my
dog
to
guard
it
*NL*
in
the
night
,
tying
him
up
to
a
stake
at
the
gate
,
where
he
would
stand
*NL*
and
bark
all
night
long
;
so
in
a
little
time
the
enemies
forsook
the
*NL*
place
,
and
the
corn
grew
very
strong
and
well
,
and
began
to
ripen
apace
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
beasts
ruined
me
before
,
while
my
corn
was
in
the
blade
,
so
*NL*
the
birds
were
as
likely
to
ruin
me
now
,
when
it
was
in
the
ear
;
for
,
*NL*
going
along
by
the
place
to
see
how
it
throve
,
I
saw
my
little
crop
*NL*
surrounded
with
fowls
,
of
I
know
not
how
many
sorts
,
who
stood
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
watching
till
I
should
be
gone
.
I
immediately
let
fly
among
them
,
*NL*
for
I
always
had
my
gun
with
me
.
I
had
no
sooner
shot
,
but
there
rose
up
*NL*
a
little
cloud
of
fowls
,
which
I
had
not
seen
at
all
,
from
among
the
corn
*NL*
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
touched
me
sensibly
,
for
I
foresaw
that
in
a
few
days
they
would
*NL*
devour
all
my
hopes
;
that
I
should
be
starved
,
and
never
be
able
to
raise
*NL*
a
crop
at
all
;
and
what
to
do
I
could
not
tell
;
however
,
I
resolved
not
*NL*
to
lose
my
corn
,
if
possible
,
though
I
should
watch
it
night
and
day
.
In
*NL*
the
first
place
,
I
went
among
it
to
see
what
damage
was
already
done
,
and
*NL*
found
they
had
spoiled
a
good
deal
of
it
;
but
that
as
it
was
yet
too
*NL*
green
for
them
,
the
loss
was
not
so
great
but
that
the
remainder
was
*NL*
likely
to
be
a
good
crop
if
it
could
be
saved
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stayed
by
it
to
load
my
gun
,
and
then
coming
away
,
I
could
easily
see
*NL*
the
thieves
sitting
upon
all
the
trees
about
me
,
as
if
they
only
waited
*NL*
till
I
was
gone
away
,
and
the
event
proved
it
to
be
so
;
for
as
I
walked
*NL*
off
,
as
if
I
was
gone
,
I
was
no
sooner
out
of
their
sight
than
they
*NL*
dropped
down
one
by
one
into
the
corn
again
.
I
was
so
provoked
,
that
I
*NL*
could
not
have
patience
to
stay
till
more
came
on
,
knowing
that
every
*NL*
grain
that
they
ate
now
was
,
as
it
might
be
said
,
a
peck-loaf
to
me
in
*NL*
the
consequence
;
but
coming
up
to
the
hedge
,
I
fired
again
,
and
killed
*NL*
three
of
them
.
This
was
what
I
wished
for
;
so
I
took
them
up
,
and
served
*NL*
them
as
we
serve
notorious
thieves
in
England
--
hanged
them
in
chains
,
for
*NL*
a
terror
to
others
.
It
is
impossible
to
imagine
that
this
should
have
*NL*
such
an
effect
as
it
had
,
for
the
fowls
would
not
only
not
come
at
the
*NL*
corn
,
but
,
in
short
,
they
forsook
all
that
part
of
the
island
,
and
I
*NL*
could
never
see
a
bird
near
the
place
as
long
as
my
scarecrows
hung
*NL*
there
.
This
I
was
very
glad
of
,
you
may
be
sure
,
and
about
the
latter
*NL*
end
of
December
,
which
was
our
second
harvest
of
the
year
,
I
reaped
my
*NL*
corn
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sadly
put
to
it
for
a
scythe
or
sickle
to
cut
it
down
,
and
all
I
*NL*
could
do
was
to
make
one
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
out
of
one
of
the
*NL*
broadswords
,
or
cutlasses
,
which
I
saved
among
the
arms
out
of
the
ship
.
*NL*
However
,
as
my
first
crop
was
but
small
,
I
had
no
great
difficulty
to
cut
*NL*
it
down
;
in
short
,
I
reaped
it
in
my
way
,
for
I
cut
nothing
off
but
the
*NL*
ears
,
and
carried
it
away
in
a
great
basket
which
I
had
made
,
and
so
*NL*
rubbed
it
out
with
my
hands
;
and
at
the
end
of
all
my
harvesting
,
I
found
*NL*
that
out
of
my
half-peck
of
seed
I
had
near
two
bushels
of
rice
,
and
*NL*
about
two
bushels
and
a
half
of
barley
;
that
is
to
say
,
by
my
guess
,
for
*NL*
I
had
no
measure
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
this
was
a
great
encouragement
to
me
,
and
I
foresaw
that
,
in
*NL*
time
,
it
would
please
God
to
supply
me
with
bread
.
And
yet
here
I
was
*NL*
perplexed
again
,
for
I
neither
knew
how
to
grind
or
make
meal
of
my
corn
,
*NL*
or
indeed
how
to
clean
it
and
part
it
;
nor
,
if
made
into
meal
,
how
to
*NL*
make
bread
of
it
;
and
if
how
to
make
it
,
yet
I
knew
not
how
to
bake
it
.
*NL*
These
things
being
added
to
my
desire
of
having
a
good
quantity
for
*NL*
store
,
and
to
secure
a
constant
supply
,
I
resolved
not
to
taste
any
of
*NL*
this
crop
but
to
preserve
it
all
for
seed
against
the
next
season
;
and
in
*NL*
the
meantime
to
employ
all
my
study
and
hours
of
working
to
accomplish
*NL*
this
great
work
of
providing
myself
with
corn
and
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
truly
said
,
that
now
I
worked
for
my
bread
.
I
believe
few
*NL*
people
have
thought
much
upon
the
strange
multitude
of
little
things
*NL*
necessary
in
the
providing
,
producing
,
curing
,
dressing
,
making
,
and
*NL*
finishing
this
one
article
of
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
that
was
reduced
to
a
mere
state
of
nature
,
found
this
to
my
daily
*NL*
discouragement
;
and
was
made
more
sensible
of
it
every
hour
,
even
after
I
*NL*
had
got
the
first
handful
of
seed-corn
,
which
,
as
I
have
said
,
came
up
*NL*
unexpectedly
,
and
indeed
to
a
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
I
had
no
plough
to
turn
up
the
earth
--
no
spade
or
shovel
to
dig
*NL*
it
.
Well
,
this
I
conquered
by
making
me
a
wooden
spade
,
as
I
observed
*NL*
before
;
but
this
did
my
work
but
in
a
wooden
manner
;
and
though
it
cost
*NL*
me
a
great
many
days
to
make
it
,
yet
,
for
want
of
iron
,
it
not
only
wore
*NL*
out
soon
,
but
made
my
work
the
harder
,
and
made
it
be
performed
much
*NL*
worse
.
However
,
this
I
bore
with
,
and
was
content
to
work
it
out
with
*NL*
patience
,
and
bear
with
the
badness
of
the
performance
.
When
the
corn
*NL*
was
sown
,
I
had
no
harrow
,
but
was
forced
to
go
over
it
myself
,
and
drag
*NL*
a
great
heavy
bough
of
a
tree
over
it
,
to
scratch
it
,
as
it
may
be
*NL*
called
,
rather
than
rake
or
harrow
it
.
When
it
was
growing
,
and
grown
,
I
*NL*
have
observed
already
how
many
things
I
wanted
to
fence
it
,
secure
it
,
*NL*
mow
or
reap
it
,
cure
and
carry
it
home
,
thrash
,
part
it
from
the
chaff
,
*NL*
and
save
it
.
Then
I
wanted
a
mill
to
grind
it
sieves
to
dress
it
,
yeast
*NL*
and
salt
to
make
it
into
bread
,
and
an
oven
to
bake
it
;
but
all
these
*NL*
things
I
did
without
,
as
shall
be
observed
;
and
yet
the
corn
was
an
*NL*
inestimable
comfort
and
advantage
to
me
too
.
All
this
,
as
I
said
,
made
*NL*
everything
laborious
and
tedious
to
me
;
but
that
there
was
no
help
for
.
*NL*
Neither
was
my
time
so
much
loss
to
me
,
because
,
as
I
had
divided
it
,
a
*NL*
certain
part
of
it
was
every
day
appointed
to
these
works
;
and
as
I
had
*NL*
resolved
to
use
none
of
the
corn
for
bread
till
I
had
a
greater
quantity
*NL*
by
me
,
I
had
the
next
six
months
to
apply
myself
wholly
,
by
labour
and
*NL*
invention
,
to
furnish
myself
with
utensils
proper
for
the
performing
all
*NL*
the
operations
necessary
for
making
the
corn
,
when
I
had
it
,
fit
for
my
*NL*
use
.

CHAPTER
IX
--
A
BOAT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
first
I
was
to
prepare
more
land
,
for
I
had
now
seed
enough
to
sow
*NL*
above
an
acre
of
ground
.
Before
I
did
this
,
I
had
a
week
's
work
at
least
*NL*
to
make
me
a
spade
,
which
,
when
it
was
done
,
was
but
a
sorry
one
indeed
,
*NL*
and
very
heavy
,
and
required
double
labour
to
work
with
it
.
However
,
I
*NL*
got
through
that
,
and
sowed
my
seed
in
two
large
flat
pieces
of
ground
,
*NL*
as
near
my
house
as
I
could
find
them
to
my
mind
,
and
fenced
them
in
with
*NL*
a
good
hedge
,
the
stakes
of
which
were
all
cut
off
that
wood
which
I
had
*NL*
set
before
,
and
knew
it
would
grow
;
so
that
,
in
a
year
's
time
,
I
knew
I
*NL*
should
have
a
quick
or
living
hedge
,
that
would
want
but
little
repair
.
*NL*
This
work
did
not
take
me
up
less
than
three
months
,
because
a
great
part
*NL*
of
that
time
was
the
wet
season
,
when
I
could
not
go
abroad
.
*NL*
Within-doors
,
that
is
when
it
rained
and
I
could
not
go
out
,
I
found
*NL*
employment
in
the
following
occupations
--
always
observing
,
that
all
the
*NL*
while
I
was
at
work
I
diverted
myself
with
talking
to
my
parrot
,
and
*NL*
teaching
him
to
speak
;
and
I
quickly
taught
him
to
know
his
own
name
,
and
*NL*
at
last
to
speak
it
out
pretty
loud
,
``
Poll
,
''
which
was
the
first
word
I
*NL*
ever
heard
spoken
in
the
island
by
any
mouth
but
my
own
.
This
,
*NL*
therefore
,
was
not
my
work
,
but
an
assistance
to
my
work
;
for
now
,
as
I
*NL*
said
,
I
had
a
great
employment
upon
my
hands
,
as
follows
:
I
had
long
*NL*
studied
to
make
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
some
earthen
vessels
,
which
,
*NL*
indeed
,
I
wanted
sorely
,
but
knew
not
where
to
come
at
them
.
However
,
*NL*
considering
the
heat
of
the
climate
,
I
did
not
doubt
but
if
I
could
find
*NL*
out
any
clay
,
I
might
make
some
pots
that
might
,
being
dried
in
the
sun
,
*NL*
be
hard
enough
and
strong
enough
to
bear
handling
,
and
to
hold
anything
*NL*
that
was
dry
,
and
required
to
be
kept
so
;
and
as
this
was
necessary
in
*NL*
the
preparing
corn
,
meal
,
&
c.
,
which
was
the
thing
I
was
doing
,
I
*NL*
resolved
to
make
some
as
large
as
I
could
,
and
fit
only
to
stand
like
*NL*
jars
,
to
hold
what
should
be
put
into
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
make
the
reader
pity
me
,
or
rather
laugh
at
me
,
to
tell
how
many
*NL*
awkward
ways
I
took
to
raise
this
paste
;
what
odd
,
misshapen
,
ugly
things
*NL*
I
made
;
how
many
of
them
fell
in
and
how
many
fell
out
,
the
clay
not
*NL*
being
stiff
enough
to
bear
its
own
weight
;
how
many
cracked
by
the
*NL*
over-violent
heat
of
the
sun
,
being
set
out
too
hastily
;
and
how
many
*NL*
fell
in
pieces
with
only
removing
,
as
well
before
as
after
they
were
*NL*
dried
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
how
,
after
having
laboured
hard
to
find
the
*NL*
clay
--
to
dig
it
,
to
temper
it
,
to
bring
it
home
,
and
work
it
--
I
could
not
*NL*
make
above
two
large
earthen
ugly
things
-LRB-
I
can
not
call
them
jars
-RRB-
in
*NL*
about
two
months
'
labour
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
the
sun
baked
these
two
very
dry
and
hard
,
I
lifted
them
very
*NL*
gently
up
,
and
set
them
down
again
in
two
great
wicker
baskets
,
which
I
*NL*
had
made
on
purpose
for
them
,
that
they
might
not
break
;
and
as
between
*NL*
the
pot
and
the
basket
there
was
a
little
room
to
spare
,
I
stuffed
it
*NL*
full
of
the
rice
and
barley
straw
;
and
these
two
pots
being
to
stand
*NL*
always
dry
I
thought
would
hold
my
dry
corn
,
and
perhaps
the
meal
,
when
*NL*
the
corn
was
bruised
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
I
miscarried
so
much
in
my
design
for
large
pots
,
yet
I
made
*NL*
several
smaller
things
with
better
success
;
such
as
little
round
pots
,
*NL*
flat
dishes
,
pitchers
,
and
pipkins
,
and
any
things
my
hand
turned
to
;
and
*NL*
the
heat
of
the
sun
baked
them
quite
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
would
not
answer
my
end
,
which
was
to
get
an
earthen
pot
to
*NL*
hold
what
was
liquid
,
and
bear
the
fire
,
which
none
of
these
could
do
.
*NL*
It
happened
after
some
time
,
making
a
pretty
large
fire
for
cooking
my
*NL*
meat
,
when
I
went
to
put
it
out
after
I
had
done
with
it
,
I
found
a
*NL*
broken
piece
of
one
of
my
earthenware
vessels
in
the
fire
,
burnt
as
hard
*NL*
as
a
stone
,
and
red
as
a
tile
.
I
was
agreeably
surprised
to
see
it
,
and
*NL*
said
to
myself
,
that
certainly
they
might
be
made
to
burn
whole
,
if
they
*NL*
would
burn
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
set
me
to
study
how
to
order
my
fire
,
so
as
to
make
it
burn
some
*NL*
pots
.
I
had
no
notion
of
a
kiln
,
such
as
the
potters
burn
in
,
or
of
*NL*
glazing
them
with
lead
,
though
I
had
some
lead
to
do
it
with
;
but
I
*NL*
placed
three
large
pipkins
and
two
or
three
pots
in
a
pile
,
one
upon
*NL*
another
,
and
placed
my
firewood
all
round
it
,
with
a
great
heap
of
embers
*NL*
under
them
.
I
plied
the
fire
with
fresh
fuel
round
the
outside
and
upon
*NL*
the
top
,
till
I
saw
the
pots
in
the
inside
red-hot
quite
through
,
and
*NL*
observed
that
they
did
not
crack
at
all
.
When
I
saw
them
clear
red
,
I
*NL*
let
them
stand
in
that
heat
about
five
or
six
hours
,
till
I
found
one
of
*NL*
them
,
though
it
did
not
crack
,
did
melt
or
run
;
for
the
sand
which
was
*NL*
mixed
with
the
clay
melted
by
the
violence
of
the
heat
,
and
would
have
*NL*
run
into
glass
if
I
had
gone
on
;
so
I
slacked
my
fire
gradually
till
the
*NL*
pots
began
to
abate
of
the
red
colour
;
and
watching
them
all
night
,
that
*NL*
I
might
not
let
the
fire
abate
too
fast
,
in
the
morning
I
had
three
very
*NL*
good
-LRB-
I
will
not
say
handsome
-RRB-
pipkins
,
and
two
other
earthen
pots
,
as
*NL*
hard
burnt
as
could
be
desired
,
and
one
of
them
perfectly
glazed
with
the
*NL*
running
of
the
sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
experiment
,
I
need
not
say
that
I
wanted
no
sort
of
*NL*
earthenware
for
my
use
;
but
I
must
needs
say
as
to
the
shapes
of
them
,
*NL*
they
were
very
indifferent
,
as
any
one
may
suppose
,
when
I
had
no
way
of
*NL*
making
them
but
as
the
children
make
dirt
pies
,
or
as
a
woman
would
make
*NL*
pies
that
never
learned
to
raise
paste
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
joy
at
a
thing
of
so
mean
a
nature
was
ever
equal
to
mine
,
when
I
*NL*
found
I
had
made
an
earthen
pot
that
would
bear
the
fire
;
and
I
had
*NL*
hardly
patience
to
stay
till
they
were
cold
before
I
set
one
on
the
fire
*NL*
again
with
some
water
in
it
to
boil
me
some
meat
,
which
it
did
admirably
*NL*
well
;
and
with
a
piece
of
a
kid
I
made
some
very
good
broth
,
though
I
*NL*
wanted
oatmeal
,
and
several
other
ingredients
requisite
to
make
it
as
*NL*
good
as
I
would
have
had
it
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
next
concern
was
to
get
me
a
stone
mortar
to
stamp
or
beat
some
corn
*NL*
in
;
for
as
to
the
mill
,
there
was
no
thought
of
arriving
at
that
*NL*
perfection
of
art
with
one
pair
of
hands
.
To
supply
this
want
,
I
was
at
*NL*
a
great
loss
;
for
,
of
all
the
trades
in
the
world
,
I
was
as
perfectly
*NL*
unqualified
for
a
stone-cutter
as
for
any
whatever
;
neither
had
I
any
*NL*
tools
to
go
about
it
with
.
I
spent
many
a
day
to
find
out
a
great
stone
*NL*
big
enough
to
cut
hollow
,
and
make
fit
for
a
mortar
,
and
could
find
none
*NL*
at
all
,
except
what
was
in
the
solid
rock
,
and
which
I
had
no
way
to
dig
*NL*
or
cut
out
;
nor
indeed
were
the
rocks
in
the
island
of
hardness
*NL*
sufficient
,
but
were
all
of
a
sandy
,
crumbling
stone
,
which
neither
would
*NL*
bear
the
weight
of
a
heavy
pestle
,
nor
would
break
the
corn
without
*NL*
filling
it
with
sand
.
So
,
after
a
great
deal
of
time
lost
in
searching
*NL*
for
a
stone
,
I
gave
it
over
,
and
resolved
to
look
out
for
a
great
block
*NL*
of
hard
wood
,
which
I
found
,
indeed
,
much
easier
;
and
getting
one
as
big
*NL*
as
I
had
strength
to
stir
,
I
rounded
it
,
and
formed
it
on
the
outside
*NL*
with
my
axe
and
hatchet
,
and
then
with
the
help
of
fire
and
infinite
*NL*
labour
,
made
a
hollow
place
in
it
,
as
the
Indians
in
Brazil
make
their
*NL*
canoes
.
After
this
,
I
made
a
great
heavy
pestle
or
beater
of
the
wood
*NL*
called
the
iron-wood
;
and
this
I
prepared
and
laid
by
against
I
had
my
*NL*
next
crop
of
corn
,
which
I
proposed
to
myself
to
grind
,
or
rather
pound
*NL*
into
meal
to
make
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
next
difficulty
was
to
make
a
sieve
or
searce
,
to
dress
my
meal
,
and
*NL*
to
part
it
from
the
bran
and
the
husk
;
without
which
I
did
not
see
it
*NL*
possible
I
could
have
any
bread
.
This
was
a
most
difficult
thing
even
to
*NL*
think
on
,
for
to
be
sure
I
had
nothing
like
the
necessary
thing
to
make
*NL*
it
--
I
mean
fine
thin
canvas
or
stuff
to
searce
the
meal
through
.
And
*NL*
here
I
was
at
a
full
stop
for
many
months
;
nor
did
I
really
know
what
to
*NL*
do
.
Linen
I
had
none
left
but
what
was
mere
rags
;
I
had
goat
's
hair
,
but
*NL*
neither
knew
how
to
weave
it
or
spin
it
;
and
had
I
known
how
,
here
were
*NL*
no
tools
to
work
it
with
.
All
the
remedy
that
I
found
for
this
was
,
that
*NL*
at
last
I
did
remember
I
had
,
among
the
seamen
's
clothes
which
were
saved
*NL*
out
of
the
ship
,
some
neckcloths
of
calico
or
muslin
;
and
with
some
*NL*
pieces
of
these
I
made
three
small
sieves
proper
enough
for
the
work
;
and
*NL*
thus
I
made
shift
for
some
years
:
how
I
did
afterwards
,
I
shall
show
in
*NL*
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baking
part
was
the
next
thing
to
be
considered
,
and
how
I
should
*NL*
make
bread
when
I
came
to
have
corn
;
for
first
,
I
had
no
yeast
.
As
to
*NL*
that
part
,
there
was
no
supplying
the
want
,
so
I
did
not
concern
myself
*NL*
much
about
it
.
But
for
an
oven
I
was
indeed
in
great
pain
.
At
length
I
*NL*
found
out
an
experiment
for
that
also
,
which
was
this
:
I
made
some
*NL*
earthen-vessels
very
broad
but
not
deep
,
that
is
to
say
,
about
two
feet
*NL*
diameter
,
and
not
above
nine
inches
deep
.
These
I
burned
in
the
fire
,
as
*NL*
I
had
done
the
other
,
and
laid
them
by
;
and
when
I
wanted
to
bake
,
I
made
*NL*
a
great
fire
upon
my
hearth
,
which
I
had
paved
with
some
square
tiles
of
*NL*
my
own
baking
and
burning
also
;
but
I
should
not
call
them
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
firewood
was
burned
pretty
much
into
embers
or
live
coals
,
I
*NL*
drew
them
forward
upon
this
hearth
,
so
as
to
cover
it
all
over
,
and
there
*NL*
I
let
them
lie
till
the
hearth
was
very
hot
.
Then
sweeping
away
all
the
*NL*
embers
,
I
set
down
my
loaf
or
loaves
,
and
whelming
down
the
earthen
pot
*NL*
upon
them
,
drew
the
embers
all
round
the
outside
of
the
pot
,
to
keep
in
*NL*
and
add
to
the
heat
;
and
thus
as
well
as
in
the
best
oven
in
the
world
,
I
*NL*
baked
my
barley-loaves
,
and
became
in
little
time
a
good
pastrycook
into
*NL*
the
bargain
;
for
I
made
myself
several
cakes
and
puddings
of
the
rice
;
*NL*
but
I
made
no
pies
,
neither
had
I
anything
to
put
into
them
supposing
I
*NL*
had
,
except
the
flesh
either
of
fowls
or
goats
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
need
not
be
wondered
at
if
all
these
things
took
me
up
most
part
of
*NL*
the
third
year
of
my
abode
here
;
for
it
is
to
be
observed
that
in
the
*NL*
intervals
of
these
things
I
had
my
new
harvest
and
husbandry
to
manage
;
*NL*
for
I
reaped
my
corn
in
its
season
,
and
carried
it
home
as
well
as
I
*NL*
could
,
and
laid
it
up
in
the
ear
,
in
my
large
baskets
,
till
I
had
time
to
*NL*
rub
it
out
,
for
I
had
no
floor
to
thrash
it
on
,
or
instrument
to
thrash
*NL*
it
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
indeed
,
my
stock
of
corn
increasing
,
I
really
wanted
to
build
my
*NL*
barns
bigger
;
I
wanted
a
place
to
lay
it
up
in
,
for
the
increase
of
the
*NL*
corn
now
yielded
me
so
much
,
that
I
had
of
the
barley
about
twenty
*NL*
bushels
,
and
of
the
rice
as
much
or
more
;
insomuch
that
now
I
resolved
to
*NL*
begin
to
use
it
freely
;
for
my
bread
had
been
quite
gone
a
great
while
;
*NL*
also
I
resolved
to
see
what
quantity
would
be
sufficient
for
me
a
whole
*NL*
year
,
and
to
sow
but
once
a
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
whole
,
I
found
that
the
forty
bushels
of
barley
and
rice
were
*NL*
much
more
than
I
could
consume
in
a
year
;
so
I
resolved
to
sow
just
the
*NL*
same
quantity
every
year
that
I
sowed
the
last
,
in
hopes
that
such
a
*NL*
quantity
would
fully
provide
me
with
bread
,
&
c.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
while
these
things
were
doing
,
you
may
be
sure
my
thoughts
ran
*NL*
many
times
upon
the
prospect
of
land
which
I
had
seen
from
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
island
;
and
I
was
not
without
secret
wishes
that
I
were
on
shore
*NL*
there
,
fancying
that
,
seeing
the
mainland
,
and
an
inhabited
country
,
I
*NL*
might
find
some
way
or
other
to
convey
myself
further
,
and
perhaps
at
*NL*
last
find
some
means
of
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
while
I
made
no
allowance
for
the
dangers
of
such
an
*NL*
undertaking
,
and
how
I
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
savages
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
such
as
I
might
have
reason
to
think
far
worse
than
the
lions
and
tigers
*NL*
of
Africa
:
that
if
I
once
came
in
their
power
,
I
should
run
a
hazard
of
*NL*
more
than
a
thousand
to
one
of
being
killed
,
and
perhaps
of
being
eaten
;
*NL*
for
I
had
heard
that
the
people
of
the
Caribbean
coast
were
cannibals
or
*NL*
man-eaters
,
and
I
knew
by
the
latitude
that
I
could
not
be
far
from
that
*NL*
shore
.
Then
,
supposing
they
were
not
cannibals
,
yet
they
might
kill
me
,
*NL*
as
many
Europeans
who
had
fallen
into
their
hands
had
been
served
,
even
*NL*
when
they
had
been
ten
or
twenty
together
--
much
more
I
,
that
was
but
one
,
*NL*
and
could
make
little
or
no
defence
;
all
these
things
,
I
say
,
which
I
*NL*
ought
to
have
considered
well
;
and
did
come
into
my
thoughts
afterwards
,
*NL*
yet
gave
me
no
apprehensions
at
first
,
and
my
head
ran
mightily
upon
the
*NL*
thought
of
getting
over
to
the
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
wished
for
my
boy
Xury
,
and
the
long-boat
with
shoulder-of-mutton
*NL*
sail
,
with
which
I
sailed
above
a
thousand
miles
on
the
coast
of
Africa
;
*NL*
but
this
was
in
vain
:
then
I
thought
I
would
go
and
look
at
our
ship
's
*NL*
boat
,
which
,
as
I
have
said
,
was
blown
up
upon
the
shore
a
great
way
,
in
*NL*
the
storm
,
when
we
were
first
cast
away
.
She
lay
almost
where
she
did
at
*NL*
first
,
but
not
quite
;
and
was
turned
,
by
the
force
of
the
waves
and
the
*NL*
winds
,
almost
bottom
upward
,
against
a
high
ridge
of
beachy
,
rough
sand
,
*NL*
but
no
water
about
her
.
If
I
had
had
hands
to
have
refitted
her
,
and
to
*NL*
have
launched
her
into
the
water
,
the
boat
would
have
done
well
enough
,
*NL*
and
I
might
have
gone
back
into
the
Brazils
with
her
easily
enough
;
but
I
*NL*
might
have
foreseen
that
I
could
no
more
turn
her
and
set
her
upright
*NL*
upon
her
bottom
than
I
could
remove
the
island
;
however
,
I
went
to
the
*NL*
woods
,
and
cut
levers
and
rollers
,
and
brought
them
to
the
boat
resolving
*NL*
to
try
what
I
could
do
;
suggesting
to
myself
that
if
I
could
but
turn
her
*NL*
down
,
I
might
repair
the
damage
she
had
received
,
and
she
would
be
a
very
*NL*
good
boat
,
and
I
might
go
to
sea
in
her
very
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
spared
no
pains
,
indeed
,
in
this
piece
of
fruitless
toil
,
and
spent
,
I
*NL*
think
,
three
or
four
weeks
about
it
;
at
last
finding
it
impossible
to
*NL*
heave
it
up
with
my
little
strength
,
I
fell
to
digging
away
the
sand
,
to
*NL*
undermine
it
,
and
so
to
make
it
fall
down
,
setting
pieces
of
wood
to
*NL*
thrust
and
guide
it
right
in
the
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
I
had
done
this
,
I
was
unable
to
stir
it
up
again
,
or
to
get
*NL*
under
it
,
much
less
to
move
it
forward
towards
the
water
;
so
I
was
forced
*NL*
to
give
it
over
;
and
yet
,
though
I
gave
over
the
hopes
of
the
boat
,
my
*NL*
desire
to
venture
over
for
the
main
increased
,
rather
than
decreased
,
as
*NL*
the
means
for
it
seemed
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
at
length
put
me
upon
thinking
whether
it
was
not
possible
to
make
*NL*
myself
a
canoe
,
or
periagua
,
such
as
the
natives
of
those
climates
make
,
*NL*
even
without
tools
,
or
,
as
I
might
say
,
without
hands
,
of
the
trunk
of
a
*NL*
great
tree
.
This
I
not
only
thought
possible
,
but
easy
,
and
pleased
*NL*
myself
extremely
with
the
thoughts
of
making
it
,
and
with
my
having
much
*NL*
more
convenience
for
it
than
any
of
the
negroes
or
Indians
;
but
not
at
*NL*
all
considering
the
particular
inconveniences
which
I
lay
under
more
than
*NL*
the
Indians
did
--
viz
.
want
of
hands
to
move
it
,
when
it
was
made
,
into
*NL*
the
water
--
a
difficulty
much
harder
for
me
to
surmount
than
all
the
*NL*
consequences
of
want
of
tools
could
be
to
them
;
for
what
was
it
to
me
,
if
*NL*
when
I
had
chosen
a
vast
tree
in
the
woods
,
and
with
much
trouble
cut
it
*NL*
down
,
if
I
had
been
able
with
my
tools
to
hew
and
dub
the
outside
into
*NL*
the
proper
shape
of
a
boat
,
and
burn
or
cut
out
the
inside
to
make
it
*NL*
hollow
,
so
as
to
make
a
boat
of
it
--
if
,
after
all
this
,
I
must
leave
it
*NL*
just
there
where
I
found
it
,
and
not
be
able
to
launch
it
into
the
water
?
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
have
thought
I
could
not
have
had
the
least
reflection
upon
my
*NL*
mind
of
my
circumstances
while
I
was
making
this
boat
,
but
I
should
have
*NL*
immediately
thought
how
I
should
get
it
into
the
sea
;
but
my
thoughts
*NL*
were
so
intent
upon
my
voyage
over
the
sea
in
it
,
that
I
never
once
*NL*
considered
how
I
should
get
it
off
the
land
:
and
it
was
really
,
in
its
*NL*
own
nature
,
more
easy
for
me
to
guide
it
over
forty-five
miles
of
sea
*NL*
than
about
forty-five
fathoms
of
land
,
where
it
lay
,
to
set
it
afloat
in
*NL*
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
work
upon
this
boat
the
most
like
a
fool
that
ever
man
did
who
*NL*
had
any
of
his
senses
awake
.
I
pleased
myself
with
the
design
,
without
*NL*
determining
whether
I
was
ever
able
to
undertake
it
;
not
but
that
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
launching
my
boat
came
often
into
my
head
;
but
I
put
a
stop
*NL*
to
my
inquiries
into
it
by
this
foolish
answer
which
I
gave
myself
--
``
Let
*NL*
me
first
make
it
;
I
warrant
I
will
find
some
way
or
other
to
get
it
along
*NL*
when
it
is
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
most
preposterous
method
;
but
the
eagerness
of
my
fancy
*NL*
prevailed
,
and
to
work
I
went
.
I
felled
a
cedar-tree
,
and
I
question
*NL*
much
whether
Solomon
ever
had
such
a
one
for
the
building
of
the
Temple
*NL*
of
Jerusalem
;
it
was
five
feet
ten
inches
diameter
at
the
lower
part
next
*NL*
the
stump
,
and
four
feet
eleven
inches
diameter
at
the
end
of
twenty-two
*NL*
feet
;
after
which
it
lessened
for
a
while
,
and
then
parted
into
branches
.
*NL*
It
was
not
without
infinite
labour
that
I
felled
this
tree
;
I
was
twenty
*NL*
days
hacking
and
hewing
at
it
at
the
bottom
;
I
was
fourteen
more
getting
*NL*
the
branches
and
limbs
and
the
vast
spreading
head
cut
off
,
which
I
*NL*
hacked
and
hewed
through
with
axe
and
hatchet
,
and
inexpressible
labour
;
*NL*
after
this
,
it
cost
me
a
month
to
shape
it
and
dub
it
to
a
proportion
,
*NL*
and
to
something
like
the
bottom
of
a
boat
,
that
it
might
swim
upright
as
*NL*
it
ought
to
do
.
It
cost
me
near
three
months
more
to
clear
the
inside
,
*NL*
and
work
it
out
so
as
to
make
an
exact
boat
of
it
;
this
I
did
,
indeed
,
*NL*
without
fire
,
by
mere
mallet
and
chisel
,
and
by
the
dint
of
hard
labour
,
*NL*
till
I
had
brought
it
to
be
a
very
handsome
periagua
,
and
big
enough
to
*NL*
have
carried
six-and-twenty
men
,
and
consequently
big
enough
to
have
*NL*
carried
me
and
all
my
cargo
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
gone
through
this
work
I
was
extremely
delighted
with
it
.
The
*NL*
boat
was
really
much
bigger
than
ever
I
saw
a
canoe
or
periagua
,
that
was
*NL*
made
of
one
tree
,
in
my
life
.
Many
a
weary
stroke
it
had
cost
,
you
may
*NL*
be
sure
;
and
had
I
gotten
it
into
the
water
,
I
make
no
question
,
but
I
*NL*
should
have
begun
the
maddest
voyage
,
and
the
most
unlikely
to
be
*NL*
performed
,
that
ever
was
undertaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
my
devices
to
get
it
into
the
water
failed
me
;
though
they
cost
*NL*
me
infinite
labour
too
.
It
lay
about
one
hundred
yards
from
the
water
,
*NL*
and
not
more
;
but
the
first
inconvenience
was
,
it
was
up
hill
towards
the
*NL*
creek
.
Well
,
to
take
away
this
discouragement
,
I
resolved
to
dig
into
*NL*
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
and
so
make
a
declivity
:
this
I
began
,
and
it
*NL*
cost
me
a
prodigious
deal
of
pains
-LRB-
but
who
grudge
pains
who
have
their
*NL*
deliverance
in
view
?
-RRB-
;
but
when
this
was
worked
through
,
and
this
*NL*
difficulty
managed
,
it
was
still
much
the
same
,
for
I
could
no
more
stir
*NL*
the
canoe
than
I
could
the
other
boat
.
Then
I
measured
the
distance
of
*NL*
ground
,
and
resolved
to
cut
a
dock
or
canal
,
to
bring
the
water
up
to
the
*NL*
canoe
,
seeing
I
could
not
bring
the
canoe
down
to
the
water
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
began
this
work
;
and
when
I
began
to
enter
upon
it
,
and
calculate
how
*NL*
deep
it
was
to
be
dug
,
how
broad
,
how
the
stuff
was
to
be
thrown
out
,
I
*NL*
found
that
,
by
the
number
of
hands
I
had
,
being
none
but
my
own
,
it
must
*NL*
have
been
ten
or
twelve
years
before
I
could
have
gone
through
with
it
;
*NL*
for
the
shore
lay
so
high
,
that
at
the
upper
end
it
must
have
been
at
*NL*
least
twenty
feet
deep
;
so
at
length
,
though
with
great
reluctancy
,
I
*NL*
gave
this
attempt
over
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
grieved
me
heartily
;
and
now
I
saw
,
though
too
late
,
the
folly
of
*NL*
beginning
a
work
before
we
count
the
cost
,
and
before
we
judge
rightly
of
*NL*
our
own
strength
to
go
through
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
this
work
I
finished
my
fourth
year
in
this
place
,
and
*NL*
kept
my
anniversary
with
the
same
devotion
,
and
with
as
much
comfort
as
*NL*
ever
before
;
for
,
by
a
constant
study
and
serious
application
to
the
Word
*NL*
of
God
,
and
by
the
assistance
of
His
grace
,
I
gained
a
different
*NL*
knowledge
from
what
I
had
before
.
I
entertained
different
notions
of
*NL*
things
.
I
looked
now
upon
the
world
as
a
thing
remote
,
which
I
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
,
no
expectations
from
,
and
,
indeed
,
no
desires
about
:
*NL*
in
a
word
,
I
had
nothing
indeed
to
do
with
it
,
nor
was
ever
likely
to
*NL*
have
,
so
I
thought
it
looked
,
as
we
may
perhaps
look
upon
it
*NL*
hereafter
--
viz
.
as
a
place
I
had
lived
in
,
but
was
come
out
of
it
;
and
*NL*
well
might
I
say
,
as
Father
Abraham
to
Dives
,
``
Between
me
and
thee
is
a
*NL*
great
gulf
fixed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
I
was
removed
from
all
the
wickedness
of
the
world
*NL*
here
;
I
had
neither
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
,
the
lusts
of
the
eye
,
nor
the
*NL*
pride
of
life
.
I
had
nothing
to
covet
,
for
I
had
all
that
I
was
now
*NL*
capable
of
enjoying
;
I
was
lord
of
the
whole
manor
;
or
,
if
I
pleased
,
I
*NL*
might
call
myself
king
or
emperor
over
the
whole
country
which
I
had
*NL*
possession
of
:
there
were
no
rivals
;
I
had
no
competitor
,
none
to
dispute
*NL*
sovereignty
or
command
with
me
:
I
might
have
raised
ship-loadings
of
*NL*
corn
,
but
I
had
no
use
for
it
;
so
I
let
as
little
grow
as
I
thought
*NL*
enough
for
my
occasion
.
I
had
tortoise
or
turtle
enough
,
but
now
and
*NL*
then
one
was
as
much
as
I
could
put
to
any
use
:
I
had
timber
enough
to
*NL*
have
built
a
fleet
of
ships
;
and
I
had
grapes
enough
to
have
made
wine
,
*NL*
or
to
have
cured
into
raisins
,
to
have
loaded
that
fleet
when
it
had
been
*NL*
built
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
I
could
make
use
of
was
all
that
was
valuable
:
I
had
enough
to
*NL*
eat
and
supply
my
wants
,
and
what
was
all
the
rest
to
me
?
If
I
killed
*NL*
more
flesh
than
I
could
eat
,
the
dog
must
eat
it
,
or
vermin
;
if
I
sowed
*NL*
more
corn
than
I
could
eat
,
it
must
be
spoiled
;
the
trees
that
I
cut
down
*NL*
were
lying
to
rot
on
the
ground
;
I
could
make
no
more
use
of
them
but
for
*NL*
fuel
,
and
that
I
had
no
occasion
for
but
to
dress
my
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
the
nature
and
experience
of
things
dictated
to
me
,
upon
just
*NL*
reflection
,
that
all
the
good
things
of
this
world
are
no
farther
good
to
*NL*
us
than
they
are
for
our
use
;
and
that
,
whatever
we
may
heap
up
to
give
*NL*
others
,
we
enjoy
just
as
much
as
we
can
use
,
and
no
more
.
The
most
*NL*
covetous
,
griping
miser
in
the
world
would
have
been
cured
of
the
vice
of
*NL*
covetousness
if
he
had
been
in
my
case
;
for
I
possessed
infinitely
more
*NL*
than
I
knew
what
to
do
with
.
I
had
no
room
for
desire
,
except
it
was
of
*NL*
things
which
I
had
not
,
and
they
were
but
trifles
,
though
,
indeed
,
of
*NL*
great
use
to
me
.
I
had
,
as
I
hinted
before
,
a
parcel
of
money
,
as
well
*NL*
gold
as
silver
,
about
thirty-six
pounds
sterling
.
Alas
!
there
the
sorry
,
*NL*
useless
stuff
lay
;
I
had
no
more
manner
of
business
for
it
;
and
often
*NL*
thought
with
myself
that
I
would
have
given
a
handful
of
it
for
a
gross
*NL*
of
tobacco-pipes
;
or
for
a
hand-mill
to
grind
my
corn
;
nay
,
I
would
have
*NL*
given
it
all
for
a
sixpenny-worth
of
turnip
and
carrot
seed
out
of
*NL*
England
,
or
for
a
handful
of
peas
and
beans
,
and
a
bottle
of
ink
.
As
it
*NL*
was
,
I
had
not
the
least
advantage
by
it
or
benefit
from
it
;
but
there
it
*NL*
lay
in
a
drawer
,
and
grew
mouldy
with
the
damp
of
the
cave
in
the
wet
*NL*
seasons
;
and
if
I
had
had
the
drawer
full
of
diamonds
,
it
had
been
the
*NL*
same
case
--
they
had
been
of
no
manner
of
value
to
me
,
because
of
no
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
brought
my
state
of
life
to
be
much
easier
in
itself
than
it
*NL*
was
at
first
,
and
much
easier
to
my
mind
,
as
well
as
to
my
body
.
I
*NL*
frequently
sat
down
to
meat
with
thankfulness
,
and
admired
the
hand
of
*NL*
God
's
providence
,
which
had
thus
spread
my
table
in
the
wilderness
.
I
*NL*
learned
to
look
more
upon
the
bright
side
of
my
condition
,
and
less
upon
*NL*
the
dark
side
,
and
to
consider
what
I
enjoyed
rather
than
what
I
wanted
;
*NL*
and
this
gave
me
sometimes
such
secret
comforts
,
that
I
can
not
express
*NL*
them
;
and
which
I
take
notice
of
here
,
to
put
those
discontented
people
*NL*
in
mind
of
it
,
who
can
not
enjoy
comfortably
what
God
has
given
them
,
*NL*
because
they
see
and
covet
something
that
He
has
not
given
them
.
All
our
*NL*
discontents
about
what
we
want
appeared
to
me
to
spring
from
the
want
of
*NL*
thankfulness
for
what
we
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
reflection
was
of
great
use
to
me
,
and
doubtless
would
be
so
to
*NL*
any
one
that
should
fall
into
such
distress
as
mine
was
;
and
this
was
,
to
*NL*
compare
my
present
condition
with
what
I
at
first
expected
it
would
be
;
*NL*
nay
,
with
what
it
would
certainly
have
been
,
if
the
good
providence
of
*NL*
God
had
not
wonderfully
ordered
the
ship
to
be
cast
up
nearer
to
the
*NL*
shore
,
where
I
not
only
could
come
at
her
,
but
could
bring
what
I
got
out
*NL*
of
her
to
the
shore
,
for
my
relief
and
comfort
;
without
which
,
I
had
*NL*
wanted
for
tools
to
work
,
weapons
for
defence
,
and
gunpowder
and
shot
for
*NL*
getting
my
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
spent
whole
hours
,
I
may
say
whole
days
,
in
representing
to
myself
,
in
*NL*
the
most
lively
colours
,
how
I
must
have
acted
if
I
had
got
nothing
out
*NL*
of
the
ship
.
How
I
could
not
have
so
much
as
got
any
food
,
except
fish
*NL*
and
turtles
;
and
that
,
as
it
was
long
before
I
found
any
of
them
,
I
must
*NL*
have
perished
first
;
that
I
should
have
lived
,
if
I
had
not
perished
,
*NL*
like
a
mere
savage
;
that
if
I
had
killed
a
goat
or
a
fowl
,
by
any
*NL*
contrivance
,
I
had
no
way
to
flay
or
open
it
,
or
part
the
flesh
from
the
*NL*
skin
and
the
bowels
,
or
to
cut
it
up
;
but
must
gnaw
it
with
my
teeth
,
and
*NL*
pull
it
with
my
claws
,
like
a
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
reflections
made
me
very
sensible
of
the
goodness
of
Providence
to
*NL*
me
,
and
very
thankful
for
my
present
condition
,
with
all
its
hardships
*NL*
and
misfortunes
;
and
this
part
also
I
can
not
but
recommend
to
the
*NL*
reflection
of
those
who
are
apt
,
in
their
misery
,
to
say
,
``
Is
any
*NL*
affliction
like
mine
?
''
Let
them
consider
how
much
worse
the
cases
of
*NL*
some
people
are
,
and
their
case
might
have
been
,
if
Providence
had
*NL*
thought
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
another
reflection
,
which
assisted
me
also
to
comfort
my
mind
with
*NL*
hopes
;
and
this
was
comparing
my
present
situation
with
what
I
had
*NL*
deserved
,
and
had
therefore
reason
to
expect
from
the
hand
of
Providence
.
*NL*
I
had
lived
a
dreadful
life
,
perfectly
destitute
of
the
knowledge
and
*NL*
fear
of
God
.
I
had
been
well
instructed
by
father
and
mother
;
neither
*NL*
had
they
been
wanting
to
me
in
their
early
endeavours
to
infuse
a
*NL*
religious
awe
of
God
into
my
mind
,
a
sense
of
my
duty
,
and
what
the
*NL*
nature
and
end
of
my
being
required
of
me
.
But
,
alas
!
falling
early
into
*NL*
the
seafaring
life
,
which
of
all
lives
is
the
most
destitute
of
the
fear
*NL*
of
God
,
though
His
terrors
are
always
before
them
;
I
say
,
falling
early
*NL*
into
the
seafaring
life
,
and
into
seafaring
company
,
all
that
little
*NL*
sense
of
religion
which
I
had
entertained
was
laughed
out
of
me
by
my
*NL*
messmates
;
by
a
hardened
despising
of
dangers
,
and
the
views
of
death
,
*NL*
which
grew
habitual
to
me
by
my
long
absence
from
all
manner
of
*NL*
opportunities
to
converse
with
anything
but
what
was
like
myself
,
or
to
*NL*
hear
anything
that
was
good
or
tended
towards
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
void
was
I
of
everything
that
was
good
,
or
the
least
sense
of
what
I
*NL*
was
,
or
was
to
be
,
that
,
in
the
greatest
deliverances
I
enjoyed
--
such
as
*NL*
my
escape
from
Sallee
;
my
being
taken
up
by
the
Portuguese
master
of
the
*NL*
ship
;
my
being
planted
so
well
in
the
Brazils
;
my
receiving
the
cargo
*NL*
from
England
,
and
the
like
--
I
never
had
once
the
words
``
Thank
God
!
''
so
*NL*
much
as
on
my
mind
,
or
in
my
mouth
;
nor
in
the
greatest
distress
had
I
so
*NL*
much
as
a
thought
to
pray
to
Him
,
or
so
much
as
to
say
,
``
Lord
,
have
mercy
*NL*
upon
me
!
''
no
,
nor
to
mention
the
name
of
God
,
unless
it
was
to
swear
by
,
*NL*
and
blaspheme
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
terrible
reflections
upon
my
mind
for
many
months
,
as
I
have
*NL*
already
observed
,
on
account
of
my
wicked
and
hardened
life
past
;
and
*NL*
when
I
looked
about
me
,
and
considered
what
particular
providences
had
*NL*
attended
me
since
my
coming
into
this
place
,
and
how
God
had
dealt
*NL*
bountifully
with
me
--
had
not
only
punished
me
less
than
my
iniquity
had
*NL*
deserved
,
but
had
so
plentifully
provided
for
me
--
this
gave
me
great
*NL*
hopes
that
my
repentance
was
accepted
,
and
that
God
had
yet
mercy
in
*NL*
store
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
reflections
I
worked
my
mind
up
,
not
only
to
a
resignation
to
*NL*
the
will
of
God
in
the
present
disposition
of
my
circumstances
,
but
even
*NL*
to
a
sincere
thankfulness
for
my
condition
;
and
that
I
,
who
was
yet
a
*NL*
living
man
,
ought
not
to
complain
,
seeing
I
had
not
the
due
punishment
of
*NL*
my
sins
;
that
I
enjoyed
so
many
mercies
which
I
had
no
reason
to
have
*NL*
expected
in
that
place
;
that
I
ought
never
more
to
repine
at
my
*NL*
condition
,
but
to
rejoice
,
and
to
give
daily
thanks
for
that
daily
bread
,
*NL*
which
nothing
but
a
crowd
of
wonders
could
have
brought
;
that
I
ought
to
*NL*
consider
I
had
been
fed
even
by
a
miracle
,
even
as
great
as
that
of
*NL*
feeding
Elijah
by
ravens
,
nay
,
by
a
long
series
of
miracles
;
and
that
I
*NL*
could
hardly
have
named
a
place
in
the
uninhabitable
part
of
the
world
*NL*
where
I
could
have
been
cast
more
to
my
advantage
;
a
place
where
,
as
I
*NL*
had
no
society
,
which
was
my
affliction
on
one
hand
,
so
I
found
no
*NL*
ravenous
beasts
,
no
furious
wolves
or
tigers
,
to
threaten
my
life
;
no
*NL*
venomous
creatures
,
or
poisons
,
which
I
might
feed
on
to
my
hurt
;
no
*NL*
savages
to
murder
and
devour
me
.
In
a
word
,
as
my
life
was
a
life
of
*NL*
sorrow
one
way
,
so
it
was
a
life
of
mercy
another
;
and
I
wanted
nothing
*NL*
to
make
it
a
life
of
comfort
but
to
be
able
to
make
my
sense
of
God
's
*NL*
goodness
to
me
,
and
care
over
me
in
this
condition
,
be
my
daily
*NL*
consolation
;
and
after
I
did
make
a
just
improvement
on
these
things
,
I
*NL*
went
away
,
and
was
no
more
sad
.
I
had
now
been
here
so
long
that
many
*NL*
things
which
I
had
brought
on
shore
for
my
help
were
either
quite
gone
,
*NL*
or
very
much
wasted
and
near
spent
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
ink
,
as
I
observed
,
had
been
gone
some
time
,
all
but
a
very
little
,
*NL*
which
I
eked
out
with
water
,
a
little
and
a
little
,
till
it
was
so
pale
,
*NL*
it
scarce
left
any
appearance
of
black
upon
the
paper
.
As
long
as
it
*NL*
lasted
I
made
use
of
it
to
minute
down
the
days
of
the
month
on
which
any
*NL*
remarkable
thing
happened
to
me
;
and
first
,
by
casting
up
times
past
,
I
*NL*
remembered
that
there
was
a
strange
concurrence
of
days
in
the
various
*NL*
providences
which
befell
me
,
and
which
,
if
I
had
been
superstitiously
*NL*
inclined
to
observe
days
as
fatal
or
fortunate
,
I
might
have
had
reason
*NL*
to
have
looked
upon
with
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
I
had
observed
that
the
same
day
that
I
broke
away
from
my
father
*NL*
and
friends
and
ran
away
to
Hull
,
in
order
to
go
to
sea
,
the
same
day
*NL*
afterwards
I
was
taken
by
the
Sallee
man-of-war
,
and
made
a
slave
;
the
*NL*
same
day
of
the
year
that
I
escaped
out
of
the
wreck
of
that
ship
in
*NL*
Yarmouth
Roads
,
that
same
day-year
afterwards
I
made
my
escape
from
*NL*
Sallee
in
a
boat
;
the
same
day
of
the
year
I
was
born
on
--
viz
.
the
30th
*NL*
of
September
,
that
same
day
I
had
my
life
so
miraculously
saved
*NL*
twenty-six
years
after
,
when
I
was
cast
on
shore
in
this
island
;
so
that
*NL*
my
wicked
life
and
my
solitary
life
began
both
on
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
thing
to
my
ink
being
wasted
was
that
of
my
bread
--
I
mean
the
*NL*
biscuit
which
I
brought
out
of
the
ship
;
this
I
had
husbanded
to
the
last
*NL*
degree
,
allowing
myself
but
one
cake
of
bread
a-day
for
above
a
year
;
and
*NL*
yet
I
was
quite
without
bread
for
near
a
year
before
I
got
any
corn
of
my
*NL*
own
,
and
great
reason
I
had
to
be
thankful
that
I
had
any
at
all
,
the
*NL*
getting
it
being
,
as
has
been
already
observed
,
next
to
miraculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
clothes
,
too
,
began
to
decay
;
as
to
linen
,
I
had
had
none
a
good
*NL*
while
,
except
some
chequered
shirts
which
I
found
in
the
chests
of
the
*NL*
other
seamen
,
and
which
I
carefully
preserved
;
because
many
times
I
could
*NL*
bear
no
other
clothes
on
but
a
shirt
;
and
it
was
a
very
great
help
to
me
*NL*
that
I
had
,
among
all
the
men
's
clothes
of
the
ship
,
almost
three
dozen
*NL*
of
shirts
.
There
were
also
,
indeed
,
several
thick
watch-coats
of
the
*NL*
seamen
's
which
were
left
,
but
they
were
too
hot
to
wear
;
and
though
it
is
*NL*
true
that
the
weather
was
so
violently
hot
that
there
was
no
need
of
*NL*
clothes
,
yet
I
could
not
go
quite
naked
--
no
,
though
I
had
been
inclined
*NL*
to
it
,
which
I
was
not
--
nor
could
I
abide
the
thought
of
it
,
though
I
was
*NL*
alone
.
The
reason
why
I
could
not
go
naked
was
,
I
could
not
bear
the
*NL*
heat
of
the
sun
so
well
when
quite
naked
as
with
some
clothes
on
;
nay
,
*NL*
the
very
heat
frequently
blistered
my
skin
:
whereas
,
with
a
shirt
on
,
the
*NL*
air
itself
made
some
motion
,
and
whistling
under
the
shirt
,
was
twofold
*NL*
cooler
than
without
it
.
No
more
could
I
ever
bring
myself
to
go
out
in
*NL*
the
heat
of
the
sun
without
a
cap
or
a
hat
;
the
heat
of
the
sun
,
beating
*NL*
with
such
violence
as
it
does
in
that
place
,
would
give
me
the
headache
*NL*
presently
,
by
darting
so
directly
on
my
head
,
without
a
cap
or
hat
on
,
so
*NL*
that
I
could
not
bear
it
;
whereas
,
if
I
put
on
my
hat
it
would
presently
*NL*
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
these
views
I
began
to
consider
about
putting
the
few
rags
I
had
,
*NL*
which
I
called
clothes
,
into
some
order
;
I
had
worn
out
all
the
*NL*
waistcoats
I
had
,
and
my
business
was
now
to
try
if
I
could
not
make
*NL*
jackets
out
of
the
great
watch-coats
which
I
had
by
me
,
and
with
such
*NL*
other
materials
as
I
had
;
so
I
set
to
work
,
tailoring
,
or
rather
,
indeed
,
*NL*
botching
,
for
I
made
most
piteous
work
of
it
.
However
,
I
made
shift
to
*NL*
make
two
or
three
new
waistcoats
,
which
I
hoped
would
serve
me
a
great
*NL*
while
:
as
for
breeches
or
drawers
,
I
made
but
a
very
sorry
shift
indeed
*NL*
till
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
that
I
saved
the
skins
of
all
the
creatures
that
I
*NL*
killed
,
I
mean
four-footed
ones
,
and
I
had
them
hung
up
,
stretched
out
*NL*
with
sticks
in
the
sun
,
by
which
means
some
of
them
were
so
dry
and
hard
*NL*
that
they
were
fit
for
little
,
but
others
were
very
useful
.
The
first
*NL*
thing
I
made
of
these
was
a
great
cap
for
my
head
,
with
the
hair
on
the
*NL*
outside
,
to
shoot
off
the
rain
;
and
this
I
performed
so
well
,
that
after
*NL*
I
made
me
a
suit
of
clothes
wholly
of
these
skins
--
that
is
to
say
,
a
*NL*
waistcoat
,
and
breeches
open
at
the
knees
,
and
both
loose
,
for
they
were
*NL*
rather
wanting
to
keep
me
cool
than
to
keep
me
warm
.
I
must
not
omit
to
*NL*
acknowledge
that
they
were
wretchedly
made
;
for
if
I
was
a
bad
carpenter
,
*NL*
I
was
a
worse
tailor
.
However
,
they
were
such
as
I
made
very
good
shift
*NL*
with
,
and
when
I
was
out
,
if
it
happened
to
rain
,
the
hair
of
my
*NL*
waistcoat
and
cap
being
outermost
,
I
was
kept
very
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
I
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
and
pains
to
make
an
umbrella
;
I
*NL*
was
,
indeed
,
in
great
want
of
one
,
and
had
a
great
mind
to
make
one
;
I
*NL*
had
seen
them
made
in
the
Brazils
,
where
they
are
very
useful
in
the
*NL*
great
heats
there
,
and
I
felt
the
heats
every
jot
as
great
here
,
and
*NL*
greater
too
,
being
nearer
the
equinox
;
besides
,
as
I
was
obliged
to
be
*NL*
much
abroad
,
it
was
a
most
useful
thing
to
me
,
as
well
for
the
rains
as
*NL*
the
heats
.
I
took
a
world
of
pains
with
it
,
and
was
a
great
while
before
*NL*
I
could
make
anything
likely
to
hold
:
nay
,
after
I
had
thought
I
had
hit
*NL*
the
way
,
I
spoiled
two
or
three
before
I
made
one
to
my
mind
:
but
at
last
*NL*
I
made
one
that
answered
indifferently
well
:
the
main
difficulty
I
found
*NL*
was
to
make
it
let
down
.
I
could
make
it
spread
,
but
if
it
did
not
let
*NL*
down
too
,
and
draw
in
,
it
was
not
portable
for
me
any
way
but
just
over
*NL*
my
head
,
which
would
not
do
.
However
,
at
last
,
as
I
said
,
I
made
one
to
*NL*
answer
,
and
covered
it
with
skins
,
the
hair
upwards
,
so
that
it
cast
off
*NL*
the
rain
like
a
pent-house
,
and
kept
off
the
sun
so
effectually
,
that
I
*NL*
could
walk
out
in
the
hottest
of
the
weather
with
greater
advantage
than
*NL*
I
could
before
in
the
coolest
,
and
when
I
had
no
need
of
it
could
close
*NL*
it
,
and
carry
it
under
my
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
lived
mighty
comfortably
,
my
mind
being
entirely
composed
by
*NL*
resigning
myself
to
the
will
of
God
,
and
throwing
myself
wholly
upon
the
*NL*
disposal
of
His
providence
.
This
made
my
life
better
than
sociable
,
for
*NL*
when
I
began
to
regret
the
want
of
conversation
I
would
ask
myself
,
*NL*
whether
thus
conversing
mutually
with
my
own
thoughts
,
and
-LRB-
as
I
hope
I
*NL*
may
say
-RRB-
with
even
God
Himself
,
by
ejaculations
,
was
not
better
than
the
*NL*
utmost
enjoyment
of
human
society
in
the
world
?

CHAPTER
X
--
TAMES
GOATS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
say
that
after
this
,
for
five
years
,
any
extraordinary
thing
*NL*
happened
to
me
,
but
I
lived
on
in
the
same
course
,
in
the
same
posture
*NL*
and
place
,
as
before
;
the
chief
things
I
was
employed
in
,
besides
my
*NL*
yearly
labour
of
planting
my
barley
and
rice
,
and
curing
my
raisins
,
of
*NL*
both
which
I
always
kept
up
just
enough
to
have
sufficient
stock
of
one
*NL*
year
's
provisions
beforehand
;
I
say
,
besides
this
yearly
labour
,
and
my
*NL*
daily
pursuit
of
going
out
with
my
gun
,
I
had
one
labour
,
to
make
a
*NL*
canoe
,
which
at
last
I
finished
:
so
that
,
by
digging
a
canal
to
it
of
six
*NL*
feet
wide
and
four
feet
deep
,
I
brought
it
into
the
creek
,
almost
half
a
*NL*
mile
.
As
for
the
first
,
which
was
so
vastly
big
,
for
I
made
it
without
*NL*
considering
beforehand
,
as
I
ought
to
have
done
,
how
I
should
be
able
to
*NL*
launch
it
,
so
,
never
being
able
to
bring
it
into
the
water
,
or
bring
the
*NL*
water
to
it
,
I
was
obliged
to
let
it
lie
where
it
was
as
a
memorandum
to
*NL*
teach
me
to
be
wiser
the
next
time
:
indeed
,
the
next
time
,
though
I
could
*NL*
not
get
a
tree
proper
for
it
,
and
was
in
a
place
where
I
could
not
get
*NL*
the
water
to
it
at
any
less
distance
than
,
as
I
have
said
,
near
half
a
*NL*
mile
,
yet
,
as
I
saw
it
was
practicable
at
last
,
I
never
gave
it
over
;
and
*NL*
though
I
was
near
two
years
about
it
,
yet
I
never
grudged
my
labour
,
in
*NL*
hopes
of
having
a
boat
to
go
off
to
sea
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
though
my
little
periagua
was
finished
,
yet
the
size
of
it
was
*NL*
not
at
all
answerable
to
the
design
which
I
had
in
view
when
I
made
the
*NL*
first
;
I
mean
of
venturing
over
to
the
_
terra
firma
_
,
where
it
was
above
*NL*
forty
miles
broad
;
accordingly
,
the
smallness
of
my
boat
assisted
to
put
*NL*
an
end
to
that
design
,
and
now
I
thought
no
more
of
it
.
As
I
had
a
boat
,
*NL*
my
next
design
was
to
make
a
cruise
round
the
island
;
for
as
I
had
been
*NL*
on
the
other
side
in
one
place
,
crossing
,
as
I
have
already
described
it
,
*NL*
over
the
land
,
so
the
discoveries
I
made
in
that
little
journey
made
me
*NL*
very
eager
to
see
other
parts
of
the
coast
;
and
now
I
had
a
boat
,
I
*NL*
thought
of
nothing
but
sailing
round
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
purpose
,
that
I
might
do
everything
with
discretion
and
*NL*
consideration
,
I
fitted
up
a
little
mast
in
my
boat
,
and
made
a
sail
too
*NL*
out
of
some
of
the
pieces
of
the
ship
's
sails
which
lay
in
store
,
and
of
*NL*
which
I
had
a
great
stock
by
me
.
Having
fitted
my
mast
and
sail
,
and
*NL*
tried
the
boat
,
I
found
she
would
sail
very
well
;
then
I
made
little
*NL*
lockers
or
boxes
at
each
end
of
my
boat
,
to
put
provisions
,
necessaries
,
*NL*
ammunition
,
&
c.
,
into
,
to
be
kept
dry
,
either
from
rain
or
the
spray
of
*NL*
the
sea
;
and
a
little
,
long
,
hollow
place
I
cut
in
the
inside
of
the
*NL*
boat
,
where
I
could
lay
my
gun
,
making
a
flap
to
hang
down
over
it
to
*NL*
keep
it
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
fixed
my
umbrella
also
in
the
step
at
the
stern
,
like
a
mast
,
to
stand
*NL*
over
my
head
,
and
keep
the
heat
of
the
sun
off
me
,
like
an
awning
;
and
*NL*
thus
I
every
now
and
then
took
a
little
voyage
upon
the
sea
,
but
never
*NL*
went
far
out
,
nor
far
from
the
little
creek
.
At
last
,
being
eager
to
*NL*
view
the
circumference
of
my
little
kingdom
,
I
resolved
upon
my
cruise
;
*NL*
and
accordingly
I
victualled
my
ship
for
the
voyage
,
putting
in
two
dozen
*NL*
of
loaves
-LRB-
cakes
I
should
call
them
-RRB-
of
barley-bread
,
an
earthen
pot
full
*NL*
of
parched
rice
-LRB-
a
food
I
ate
a
good
deal
of
-RRB-
,
a
little
bottle
of
rum
,
*NL*
half
a
goat
,
and
powder
and
shot
for
killing
more
,
and
two
large
*NL*
watch-coats
,
of
those
which
,
as
I
mentioned
before
,
I
had
saved
out
of
*NL*
the
seamen
's
chests
;
these
I
took
,
one
to
lie
upon
,
and
the
other
to
*NL*
cover
me
in
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
6th
of
November
,
in
the
sixth
year
of
my
reign
--
or
my
*NL*
captivity
,
which
you
please
--
that
I
set
out
on
this
voyage
,
and
I
found
*NL*
it
much
longer
than
I
expected
;
for
though
the
island
itself
was
not
very
*NL*
large
,
yet
when
I
came
to
the
east
side
of
it
,
I
found
a
great
ledge
of
*NL*
rocks
lie
out
about
two
leagues
into
the
sea
,
some
above
water
,
some
*NL*
under
it
;
and
beyond
that
a
shoal
of
sand
,
lying
dry
half
a
league
more
,
*NL*
so
that
I
was
obliged
to
go
a
great
way
out
to
sea
to
double
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
first
discovered
them
,
I
was
going
to
give
over
my
enterprise
,
and
*NL*
come
back
again
,
not
knowing
how
far
it
might
oblige
me
to
go
out
to
sea
;
*NL*
and
above
all
,
doubting
how
I
should
get
back
again
:
so
I
came
to
an
*NL*
anchor
;
for
I
had
made
a
kind
of
an
anchor
with
a
piece
of
a
broken
*NL*
grappling
which
I
got
out
of
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
secured
my
boat
,
I
took
my
gun
and
went
on
shore
,
climbing
up
a
*NL*
hill
,
which
seemed
to
overlook
that
point
where
I
saw
the
full
extent
of
*NL*
it
,
and
resolved
to
venture
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
viewing
the
sea
from
that
hill
where
I
stood
,
I
perceived
a
strong
,
*NL*
and
indeed
a
most
furious
current
,
which
ran
to
the
east
,
and
even
came
*NL*
close
to
the
point
;
and
I
took
the
more
notice
of
it
because
I
saw
there
*NL*
might
be
some
danger
that
when
I
came
into
it
I
might
be
carried
out
to
*NL*
sea
by
the
strength
of
it
,
and
not
be
able
to
make
the
island
again
;
and
*NL*
indeed
,
had
I
not
got
first
upon
this
hill
,
I
believe
it
would
have
been
*NL*
so
;
for
there
was
the
same
current
on
the
other
side
the
island
,
only
*NL*
that
it
set
off
at
a
further
distance
,
and
I
saw
there
was
a
strong
eddy
*NL*
under
the
shore
;
so
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
get
out
of
the
first
*NL*
current
,
and
I
should
presently
be
in
an
eddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
here
,
however
,
two
days
,
because
the
wind
blowing
pretty
fresh
at
*NL*
ESE.
,
and
that
being
just
contrary
to
the
current
,
made
a
great
breach
of
*NL*
the
sea
upon
the
point
:
so
that
it
was
not
safe
for
me
to
keep
too
close
*NL*
to
the
shore
for
the
breach
,
nor
to
go
too
far
off
,
because
of
the
*NL*
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
day
,
in
the
morning
,
the
wind
having
abated
overnight
,
the
sea
*NL*
was
calm
,
and
I
ventured
:
but
I
am
a
warning
to
all
rash
and
ignorant
*NL*
pilots
;
for
no
sooner
was
I
come
to
the
point
,
when
I
was
not
even
my
*NL*
boat
's
length
from
the
shore
,
but
I
found
myself
in
a
great
depth
of
*NL*
water
,
and
a
current
like
the
sluice
of
a
mill
;
it
carried
my
boat
along
*NL*
with
it
with
such
violence
that
all
I
could
do
could
not
keep
her
so
much
*NL*
as
on
the
edge
of
it
;
but
I
found
it
hurried
me
farther
and
farther
out
*NL*
from
the
eddy
,
which
was
on
my
left
hand
.
There
was
no
wind
stirring
to
*NL*
help
me
,
and
all
I
could
do
with
my
paddles
signified
nothing
:
and
now
I
*NL*
began
to
give
myself
over
for
lost
;
for
as
the
current
was
on
both
sides
*NL*
of
the
island
,
I
knew
in
a
few
leagues
distance
they
must
join
again
,
and
*NL*
then
I
was
irrecoverably
gone
;
nor
did
I
see
any
possibility
of
avoiding
*NL*
it
;
so
that
I
had
no
prospect
before
me
but
of
perishing
,
not
by
the
sea
,
*NL*
for
that
was
calm
enough
,
but
of
starving
from
hunger
.
I
had
,
indeed
,
*NL*
found
a
tortoise
on
the
shore
,
as
big
almost
as
I
could
lift
,
and
had
*NL*
tossed
it
into
the
boat
;
and
I
had
a
great
jar
of
fresh
water
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
one
of
my
earthen
pots
;
but
what
was
all
this
to
being
driven
into
*NL*
the
vast
ocean
,
where
,
to
be
sure
,
there
was
no
shore
,
no
mainland
or
*NL*
island
,
for
a
thousand
leagues
at
least
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
saw
how
easy
it
was
for
the
providence
of
God
to
make
even
the
*NL*
most
miserable
condition
of
mankind
worse
.
Now
I
looked
back
upon
my
*NL*
desolate
,
solitary
island
as
the
most
pleasant
place
in
the
world
and
all
*NL*
the
happiness
my
heart
could
wish
for
was
to
be
but
there
again
.
I
*NL*
stretched
out
my
hands
to
it
,
with
eager
wishes
--
``
O
happy
desert
!
''
said
*NL*
I
,
``
I
shall
never
see
thee
more
.
O
miserable
creature
!
whither
am
*NL*
going
?
''
Then
I
reproached
myself
with
my
unthankful
temper
,
and
that
I
*NL*
had
repined
at
my
solitary
condition
;
and
now
what
would
I
give
to
be
on
*NL*
shore
there
again
!
Thus
,
we
never
see
the
true
state
of
our
condition
*NL*
till
it
is
illustrated
to
us
by
its
contraries
,
nor
know
how
to
value
*NL*
what
we
enjoy
,
but
by
the
want
of
it
.
It
is
scarcely
possible
to
imagine
*NL*
the
consternation
I
was
now
in
,
being
driven
from
my
beloved
island
-LRB-
for
*NL*
so
it
appeared
to
me
now
to
be
-RRB-
into
the
wide
ocean
,
almost
two
leagues
,
*NL*
and
in
the
utmost
despair
of
ever
recovering
it
again
.
However
,
I
worked
*NL*
hard
till
,
indeed
,
my
strength
was
almost
exhausted
,
and
kept
my
boat
as
*NL*
much
to
the
northward
,
that
is
,
towards
the
side
of
the
current
which
the
*NL*
eddy
lay
on
,
as
possibly
I
could
;
when
about
noon
,
as
the
sun
passed
the
*NL*
meridian
,
I
thought
I
felt
a
little
breeze
of
wind
in
my
face
,
springing
*NL*
up
from
SSE
.
This
cheered
my
heart
a
little
,
and
especially
when
,
in
*NL*
about
half-an-hour
more
,
it
blew
a
pretty
gentle
gale
.
By
this
time
I
*NL*
had
got
at
a
frightful
distance
from
the
island
,
and
had
the
least
cloudy
*NL*
or
hazy
weather
intervened
,
I
had
been
undone
another
way
,
too
;
for
I
had
*NL*
no
compass
on
board
,
and
should
never
have
known
how
to
have
steered
*NL*
towards
the
island
,
if
I
had
but
once
lost
sight
of
it
;
but
the
weather
*NL*
continuing
clear
,
I
applied
myself
to
get
up
my
mast
again
,
and
spread
my
*NL*
sail
,
standing
away
to
the
north
as
much
as
possible
,
to
get
out
of
the
*NL*
current
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
I
had
set
my
mast
and
sail
,
and
the
boat
began
to
stretch
away
,
I
*NL*
saw
even
by
the
clearness
of
the
water
some
alteration
of
the
current
was
*NL*
near
;
for
where
the
current
was
so
strong
the
water
was
foul
;
but
*NL*
perceiving
the
water
clear
,
I
found
the
current
abate
;
and
presently
I
*NL*
found
to
the
east
,
at
about
half
a
mile
,
a
breach
of
the
sea
upon
some
*NL*
rocks
:
these
rocks
I
found
caused
the
current
to
part
again
,
and
as
the
*NL*
main
stress
of
it
ran
away
more
southerly
,
leaving
the
rocks
to
the
*NL*
north-east
,
so
the
other
returned
by
the
repulse
of
the
rocks
,
and
made
a
*NL*
strong
eddy
,
which
ran
back
again
to
the
north-west
,
with
a
very
sharp
*NL*
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
who
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
reprieve
brought
to
them
upon
the
*NL*
ladder
,
or
to
be
rescued
from
thieves
just
going
to
murder
them
,
or
who
*NL*
have
been
in
such
extremities
,
may
guess
what
my
present
surprise
of
joy
*NL*
was
,
and
how
gladly
I
put
my
boat
into
the
stream
of
this
eddy
;
and
the
*NL*
wind
also
freshening
,
how
gladly
I
spread
my
sail
to
it
,
running
*NL*
cheerfully
before
the
wind
,
and
with
a
strong
tide
or
eddy
underfoot
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
eddy
carried
me
about
a
league
on
my
way
back
again
,
directly
*NL*
towards
the
island
,
but
about
two
leagues
more
to
the
northward
than
the
*NL*
current
which
carried
me
away
at
first
;
so
that
when
I
came
near
the
*NL*
island
,
I
found
myself
open
to
the
northern
shore
of
it
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
the
other
end
of
the
island
,
opposite
to
that
which
I
went
out
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
made
something
more
than
a
league
of
way
by
the
help
of
this
*NL*
current
or
eddy
,
I
found
it
was
spent
,
and
served
me
no
further
.
*NL*
However
,
I
found
that
being
between
two
great
currents
--
viz
.
that
on
the
*NL*
south
side
,
which
had
hurried
me
away
,
and
that
on
the
north
,
which
lay
*NL*
about
a
league
on
the
other
side
;
I
say
,
between
these
two
,
in
the
wake
*NL*
of
the
island
,
I
found
the
water
at
least
still
,
and
running
no
way
;
and
*NL*
having
still
a
breeze
of
wind
fair
for
me
,
I
kept
on
steering
directly
*NL*
for
the
island
,
though
not
making
such
fresh
way
as
I
did
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
four
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
being
then
within
a
league
of
the
*NL*
island
,
I
found
the
point
of
the
rocks
which
occasioned
this
disaster
*NL*
stretching
out
,
as
is
described
before
,
to
the
southward
,
and
casting
off
*NL*
the
current
more
southerly
,
had
,
of
course
,
made
another
eddy
to
the
*NL*
north
;
and
this
I
found
very
strong
,
but
not
directly
setting
the
way
my
*NL*
course
lay
,
which
was
due
west
,
but
almost
full
north
.
However
,
having
a
*NL*
fresh
gale
,
I
stretched
across
this
eddy
,
slanting
north-west
;
and
in
*NL*
about
an
hour
came
within
about
a
mile
of
the
shore
,
where
,
it
being
*NL*
smooth
water
,
I
soon
got
to
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
on
shore
,
God
I
fell
on
my
knees
and
gave
God
thanks
for
my
*NL*
deliverance
,
resolving
to
lay
aside
all
thoughts
of
my
deliverance
by
my
*NL*
boat
;
and
refreshing
myself
with
such
things
as
I
had
,
I
brought
my
boat
*NL*
close
to
the
shore
,
in
a
little
cove
that
I
had
spied
under
some
trees
,
*NL*
and
laid
me
down
to
sleep
,
being
quite
spent
with
the
labour
and
fatigue
*NL*
of
the
voyage
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
at
a
great
loss
which
way
to
get
home
with
my
boat
!
I
had
run
*NL*
so
much
hazard
,
and
knew
too
much
of
the
case
,
to
think
of
attempting
it
*NL*
by
the
way
I
went
out
;
and
what
might
be
at
the
other
side
-LRB-
I
mean
the
*NL*
west
side
-RRB-
I
knew
not
,
nor
had
I
any
mind
to
run
any
more
ventures
;
so
I
*NL*
resolved
on
the
next
morning
to
make
my
way
westward
along
the
shore
,
and
*NL*
to
see
if
there
was
no
creek
where
I
might
lay
up
my
frigate
in
safety
,
*NL*
so
as
to
have
her
again
if
I
wanted
her
.
In
about
three
miles
or
*NL*
thereabouts
,
coasting
the
shore
,
I
came
to
a
very
good
inlet
or
bay
,
*NL*
about
a
mile
over
,
which
narrowed
till
it
came
to
a
very
little
rivulet
*NL*
or
brook
,
where
I
found
a
very
convenient
harbour
for
my
boat
,
and
where
*NL*
she
lay
as
if
she
had
been
in
a
little
dock
made
on
purpose
for
her
.
*NL*
Here
I
put
in
,
and
having
stowed
my
boat
very
safe
,
I
went
on
shore
to
*NL*
look
about
me
,
and
see
where
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
found
I
had
but
a
little
passed
by
the
place
where
I
had
been
*NL*
before
,
when
I
travelled
on
foot
to
that
shore
;
so
taking
nothing
out
of
*NL*
my
boat
but
my
gun
and
umbrella
,
for
it
was
exceedingly
hot
,
I
began
my
*NL*
march
.
The
way
was
comfortable
enough
after
such
a
voyage
as
I
had
been
*NL*
upon
,
and
I
reached
my
old
bower
in
the
evening
,
where
I
found
everything
*NL*
standing
as
I
left
it
;
for
I
always
kept
it
in
good
order
,
being
,
as
I
*NL*
said
before
,
my
country
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
over
the
fence
,
and
laid
me
down
in
the
shade
to
rest
my
limbs
,
for
*NL*
I
was
very
weary
,
and
fell
asleep
;
but
judge
you
,
if
you
can
,
that
read
*NL*
my
story
,
what
a
surprise
I
must
be
in
when
I
was
awaked
out
of
my
sleep
*NL*
by
a
voice
calling
me
by
my
name
several
times
,
``
Robin
,
Robin
,
Robin
*NL*
Crusoe
:
poor
Robin
Crusoe
!
Where
are
you
,
Robin
Crusoe
?
Where
are
you
?
*NL*
Where
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
dead
asleep
at
first
,
being
fatigued
with
rowing
,
or
part
of
the
*NL*
day
,
and
with
walking
the
latter
part
,
that
I
did
not
wake
thoroughly
;
*NL*
but
dozing
thought
I
dreamed
that
somebody
spoke
to
me
;
but
as
the
voice
*NL*
continued
to
repeat
,
``
Robin
Crusoe
,
Robin
Crusoe
,
''
at
last
I
began
to
*NL*
wake
more
perfectly
,
and
was
at
first
dreadfully
frightened
,
and
started
*NL*
up
in
the
utmost
consternation
;
but
no
sooner
were
my
eyes
open
,
but
I
*NL*
saw
my
Poll
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
hedge
;
and
immediately
knew
that
it
*NL*
was
he
that
spoke
to
me
;
for
just
in
such
bemoaning
language
I
had
used
*NL*
to
talk
to
him
and
teach
him
;
and
he
had
learned
it
so
perfectly
that
he
*NL*
would
sit
upon
my
finger
,
and
lay
his
bill
close
to
my
face
and
cry
,
*NL*
``
Poor
Robin
Crusoe
!
Where
are
you
?
Where
have
you
been
?
How
came
you
*NL*
here
?
''
and
such
things
as
I
had
taught
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
even
though
I
knew
it
was
the
parrot
,
and
that
indeed
it
could
*NL*
be
nobody
else
,
it
was
a
good
while
before
I
could
compose
myself
.
*NL*
First
,
I
was
amazed
how
the
creature
got
thither
;
and
then
,
how
he
should
*NL*
just
keep
about
the
place
,
and
nowhere
else
;
but
as
I
was
well
satisfied
*NL*
it
could
be
nobody
but
honest
Poll
,
I
got
over
it
;
and
holding
out
my
*NL*
hand
,
and
calling
him
by
his
name
,
``
Poll
,
''
the
sociable
creature
came
to
*NL*
me
,
and
sat
upon
my
thumb
,
as
he
used
to
do
,
and
continued
talking
to
me
,
*NL*
``
Poor
Robin
Crusoe
!
and
how
did
I
come
here
?
and
where
had
I
been
?
''
just
*NL*
as
if
he
had
been
overjoyed
to
see
me
again
;
and
so
I
carried
him
home
*NL*
along
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
had
enough
of
rambling
to
sea
for
some
time
,
and
had
enough
to
*NL*
do
for
many
days
to
sit
still
and
reflect
upon
the
danger
I
had
been
in
.
*NL*
I
would
have
been
very
glad
to
have
had
my
boat
again
on
my
side
of
the
*NL*
island
;
but
I
knew
not
how
it
was
practicable
to
get
it
about
.
As
to
the
*NL*
east
side
of
the
island
,
which
I
had
gone
round
,
I
knew
well
enough
there
*NL*
was
no
venturing
that
way
;
my
very
heart
would
shrink
,
and
my
very
blood
*NL*
run
chill
,
but
to
think
of
it
;
and
as
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
I
*NL*
did
not
know
how
it
might
be
there
;
but
supposing
the
current
ran
with
*NL*
the
same
force
against
the
shore
at
the
east
as
it
passed
by
it
on
the
*NL*
other
,
I
might
run
the
same
risk
of
being
driven
down
the
stream
,
and
*NL*
carried
by
the
island
,
as
I
had
been
before
of
being
carried
away
from
*NL*
it
:
so
with
these
thoughts
,
I
contented
myself
to
be
without
any
boat
,
*NL*
though
it
had
been
the
product
of
so
many
months
'
labour
to
make
it
,
and
*NL*
of
so
many
more
to
get
it
into
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
government
of
my
temper
I
remained
near
a
year
;
and
lived
a
very
*NL*
sedate
,
retired
life
,
as
you
may
well
suppose
;
and
my
thoughts
being
very
*NL*
much
composed
as
to
my
condition
,
and
fully
comforted
in
resigning
myself
*NL*
to
the
dispositions
of
Providence
,
I
thought
I
lived
really
very
happily
*NL*
in
all
things
except
that
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
improved
myself
in
this
time
in
all
the
mechanic
exercises
which
my
*NL*
necessities
put
me
upon
applying
myself
to
;
and
I
believe
I
should
,
upon
*NL*
occasion
,
have
made
a
very
good
carpenter
,
especially
considering
how
few
*NL*
tools
I
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
I
arrived
at
an
unexpected
perfection
in
my
earthenware
,
*NL*
and
contrived
well
enough
to
make
them
with
a
wheel
,
which
I
found
*NL*
infinitely
easier
and
better
;
because
I
made
things
round
and
shaped
,
*NL*
which
before
were
filthy
things
indeed
to
look
on
.
But
I
think
I
was
*NL*
never
more
vain
of
my
own
performance
,
or
more
joyful
for
anything
I
*NL*
found
out
,
than
for
my
being
able
to
make
a
tobacco-pipe
;
and
though
it
*NL*
was
a
very
ugly
,
clumsy
thing
when
it
was
done
,
and
only
burned
red
,
like
*NL*
other
earthenware
,
yet
as
it
was
hard
and
firm
,
and
would
draw
the
smoke
,
*NL*
I
was
exceedingly
comforted
with
it
,
for
I
had
been
always
used
to
smoke
;
*NL*
and
there
were
pipes
in
the
ship
,
but
I
forgot
them
at
first
,
not
*NL*
thinking
there
was
tobacco
in
the
island
;
and
afterwards
,
when
I
searched
*NL*
the
ship
again
,
I
could
not
come
at
any
pipes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
wicker-ware
also
I
improved
much
,
and
made
abundance
of
necessary
*NL*
baskets
,
as
well
as
my
invention
showed
me
;
though
not
very
handsome
,
yet
*NL*
they
were
such
as
were
very
handy
and
convenient
for
laying
things
up
in
,
*NL*
or
fetching
things
home
.
For
example
,
if
I
killed
a
goat
abroad
,
I
could
*NL*
hang
it
up
in
a
tree
,
flay
it
,
dress
it
,
and
cut
it
in
pieces
,
and
bring
*NL*
it
home
in
a
basket
;
and
the
like
by
a
turtle
;
I
could
cut
it
up
,
take
*NL*
out
the
eggs
and
a
piece
or
two
of
the
flesh
,
which
was
enough
for
me
,
*NL*
and
bring
them
home
in
a
basket
,
and
leave
the
rest
behind
me
.
Also
,
*NL*
large
deep
baskets
were
the
receivers
of
my
corn
,
which
I
always
rubbed
*NL*
out
as
soon
as
it
was
dry
and
cured
,
and
kept
it
in
great
baskets
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
now
to
perceive
my
powder
abated
considerably
;
this
was
a
want
*NL*
which
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
supply
,
and
I
began
seriously
to
*NL*
consider
what
I
must
do
when
I
should
have
no
more
powder
;
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
how
I
should
kill
any
goats
.
I
had
,
as
is
observed
in
the
third
*NL*
year
of
my
being
here
,
kept
a
young
kid
,
and
bred
her
up
tame
,
and
I
was
*NL*
in
hopes
of
getting
a
he-goat
;
but
I
could
not
by
any
means
bring
it
to
*NL*
pass
,
till
my
kid
grew
an
old
goat
;
and
as
I
could
never
find
in
my
heart
*NL*
to
kill
her
,
she
died
at
last
of
mere
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
being
now
in
the
eleventh
year
of
my
residence
,
and
,
as
I
have
said
,
*NL*
my
ammunition
growing
low
,
I
set
myself
to
study
some
art
to
trap
and
*NL*
snare
the
goats
,
to
see
whether
I
could
not
catch
some
of
them
alive
;
and
*NL*
particularly
I
wanted
a
she-goat
great
with
young
.
For
this
purpose
I
*NL*
made
snares
to
hamper
them
;
and
I
do
believe
they
were
more
than
once
*NL*
taken
in
them
;
but
my
tackle
was
not
good
,
for
I
had
no
wire
,
and
I
*NL*
always
found
them
broken
and
my
bait
devoured
.
At
length
I
resolved
to
*NL*
try
a
pitfall
;
so
I
dug
several
large
pits
in
the
earth
,
in
places
where
*NL*
I
had
observed
the
goats
used
to
feed
,
and
over
those
pits
I
placed
*NL*
hurdles
of
my
own
making
too
,
with
a
great
weight
upon
them
;
and
several
*NL*
times
I
put
ears
of
barley
and
dry
rice
without
setting
the
trap
;
and
I
*NL*
could
easily
perceive
that
the
goats
had
gone
in
and
eaten
up
the
corn
,
*NL*
for
I
could
see
the
marks
of
their
feet
.
At
length
I
set
three
traps
in
*NL*
one
night
,
and
going
the
next
morning
I
found
them
,
all
standing
,
and
yet
*NL*
the
bait
eaten
and
gone
;
this
was
very
discouraging
.
However
,
I
altered
*NL*
my
traps
;
and
not
to
trouble
you
with
particulars
,
going
one
morning
to
*NL*
see
my
traps
,
I
found
in
one
of
them
a
large
old
he-goat
;
and
in
one
of
*NL*
the
others
three
kids
,
a
male
and
two
females
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
old
one
,
I
knew
not
what
to
do
with
him
;
he
was
so
fierce
I
*NL*
durst
not
go
into
the
pit
to
him
;
that
is
to
say
,
to
bring
him
away
*NL*
alive
,
which
was
what
I
wanted
.
I
could
have
killed
him
,
but
that
was
*NL*
not
my
business
,
nor
would
it
answer
my
end
;
so
I
even
let
him
out
,
and
*NL*
he
ran
away
as
if
he
had
been
frightened
out
of
his
wits
.
But
I
did
not
*NL*
then
know
what
I
afterwards
learned
,
that
hunger
will
tame
a
lion
.
If
I
*NL*
had
let
him
stay
three
or
four
days
without
food
,
and
then
have
carried
*NL*
him
some
water
to
drink
and
then
a
little
corn
,
he
would
have
been
as
*NL*
tame
as
one
of
the
kids
;
for
they
are
mighty
sagacious
,
tractable
*NL*
creatures
,
where
they
are
well
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
for
the
present
I
let
him
go
,
knowing
no
better
at
that
time
:
*NL*
then
I
went
to
the
three
kids
,
and
taking
them
one
by
one
,
I
tied
them
*NL*
with
strings
together
,
and
with
some
difficulty
brought
them
all
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
good
while
before
they
would
feed
;
but
throwing
them
some
sweet
*NL*
corn
,
it
tempted
them
,
and
they
began
to
be
tame
.
And
now
I
found
that
*NL*
if
I
expected
to
supply
myself
with
goats
'
flesh
,
when
I
had
no
powder
or
*NL*
shot
left
,
breeding
some
up
tame
was
my
only
way
,
when
,
perhaps
,
I
might
*NL*
have
them
about
my
house
like
a
flock
of
sheep
.
But
then
it
occurred
to
*NL*
me
that
I
must
keep
the
tame
from
the
wild
,
or
else
they
would
always
run
*NL*
wild
when
they
grew
up
;
and
the
only
way
for
this
was
to
have
some
*NL*
enclosed
piece
of
ground
,
well
fenced
either
with
hedge
or
pale
,
to
keep
*NL*
them
in
so
effectually
,
that
those
within
might
not
break
out
,
or
those
*NL*
without
break
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
great
undertaking
for
one
pair
of
hands
yet
,
as
I
saw
there
*NL*
was
an
absolute
necessity
for
doing
it
,
my
first
work
was
to
find
out
a
*NL*
proper
piece
of
ground
,
where
there
was
likely
to
be
herbage
for
them
to
*NL*
eat
,
water
for
them
to
drink
,
and
cover
to
keep
them
from
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
understand
such
enclosures
will
think
I
had
very
little
*NL*
contrivance
when
I
pitched
upon
a
place
very
proper
for
all
these
-LRB-
being
*NL*
a
plain
,
open
piece
of
meadow
land
,
or
savannah
,
as
our
people
call
it
in
*NL*
the
western
colonies
-RRB-
,
which
had
two
or
three
little
drills
of
fresh
*NL*
water
in
it
,
and
at
one
end
was
very
woody
--
I
say
,
they
will
smile
at
my
*NL*
forecast
,
when
I
shall
tell
them
I
began
by
enclosing
this
piece
of
*NL*
ground
in
such
a
manner
that
,
my
hedge
or
pale
must
have
been
at
least
*NL*
two
miles
about
.
Nor
was
the
madness
of
it
so
great
as
to
the
compass
,
*NL*
for
if
it
was
ten
miles
about
,
I
was
like
to
have
time
enough
to
do
it
*NL*
in
;
but
I
did
not
consider
that
my
goats
would
be
as
wild
in
so
much
*NL*
compass
as
if
they
had
had
the
whole
island
,
and
I
should
have
so
much
*NL*
room
to
chase
them
in
that
I
should
never
catch
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
hedge
was
begun
and
carried
on
,
I
believe
,
about
fifty
yards
when
this
*NL*
thought
occurred
to
me
;
so
I
presently
stopped
short
,
and
,
for
the
*NL*
beginning
,
I
resolved
to
enclose
a
piece
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
yards
in
length
,
and
one
hundred
yards
in
breadth
,
which
,
as
it
would
*NL*
maintain
as
many
as
I
should
have
in
any
reasonable
time
,
so
,
as
my
stock
*NL*
increased
,
I
could
add
more
ground
to
my
enclosure
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
acting
with
some
prudence
,
and
I
went
to
work
with
courage
.
I
*NL*
was
about
three
months
hedging
in
the
first
piece
;
and
,
till
I
had
done
*NL*
it
,
I
tethered
the
three
kids
in
the
best
part
of
it
,
and
used
them
to
*NL*
feed
as
near
me
as
possible
,
to
make
them
familiar
;
and
very
often
I
*NL*
would
go
and
carry
them
some
ears
of
barley
,
or
a
handful
of
rice
,
and
*NL*
feed
them
out
of
my
hand
;
so
that
after
my
enclosure
was
finished
and
I
*NL*
let
them
loose
,
they
would
follow
me
up
and
down
,
bleating
after
me
for
a
*NL*
handful
of
corn
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
answered
my
end
,
and
in
about
a
year
and
a
half
I
had
a
flock
of
*NL*
about
twelve
goats
,
kids
and
all
;
and
in
two
years
more
I
had
*NL*
three-and-forty
,
besides
several
that
I
took
and
killed
for
my
food
.
*NL*
After
that
,
I
enclosed
five
several
pieces
of
ground
to
feed
them
in
,
*NL*
with
little
pens
to
drive
them
to
take
them
as
I
wanted
,
and
gates
out
of
*NL*
one
piece
of
ground
into
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
all
;
for
now
I
not
only
had
goat
's
flesh
to
feed
on
when
*NL*
I
pleased
,
but
milk
too
--
a
thing
which
,
indeed
,
in
the
beginning
,
I
did
*NL*
not
so
much
as
think
of
,
and
which
,
when
it
came
into
my
thoughts
,
was
*NL*
really
an
agreeable
surprise
,
for
now
I
set
up
my
dairy
,
and
had
*NL*
sometimes
a
gallon
or
two
of
milk
in
a
day
.
And
as
Nature
,
who
gives
*NL*
supplies
of
food
to
every
creature
,
dictates
even
naturally
how
to
make
*NL*
use
of
it
,
so
I
,
that
had
never
milked
a
cow
,
much
less
a
goat
,
or
seen
*NL*
butter
or
cheese
made
only
when
I
was
a
boy
,
after
a
great
many
essays
*NL*
and
miscarriages
,
made
both
butter
and
cheese
at
last
,
also
salt
-LRB-
though
*NL*
I
found
it
partly
made
to
my
hand
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
upon
some
of
the
*NL*
rocks
of
the
sea
-RRB-
,
and
never
wanted
it
afterwards
.
How
mercifully
can
*NL*
our
Creator
treat
His
creatures
,
even
in
those
conditions
in
which
they
*NL*
seemed
to
be
overwhelmed
in
destruction
!
How
can
He
sweeten
the
*NL*
bitterest
providences
,
and
give
us
cause
to
praise
Him
for
dungeons
and
*NL*
prisons
!
What
a
table
was
here
spread
for
me
in
the
wilderness
,
where
I
*NL*
saw
nothing
at
first
but
to
perish
for
hunger
!

CHAPTER
XI
--
FINDS
PRINT
OF
MAN
'S
FOOT
ON
THE
SAND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
made
a
Stoic
smile
to
have
seen
me
and
my
little
family
sit
*NL*
down
to
dinner
.
There
was
my
majesty
the
prince
and
lord
of
the
whole
*NL*
island
;
I
had
the
lives
of
all
my
subjects
at
my
absolute
command
;
I
*NL*
could
hang
,
draw
,
give
liberty
,
and
take
it
away
,
and
no
rebels
among
all
*NL*
my
subjects
.
Then
,
to
see
how
like
a
king
I
dined
,
too
,
all
alone
,
*NL*
attended
by
my
servants
!
Poll
,
as
if
he
had
been
my
favourite
,
was
the
*NL*
only
person
permitted
to
talk
to
me
.
My
dog
,
who
was
now
grown
old
and
*NL*
crazy
,
and
had
found
no
species
to
multiply
his
kind
upon
,
sat
always
at
*NL*
my
right
hand
;
and
two
cats
,
one
on
one
side
of
the
table
and
one
on
the
*NL*
other
,
expecting
now
and
then
a
bit
from
my
hand
,
as
a
mark
of
especial
*NL*
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
were
not
the
two
cats
which
I
brought
on
shore
at
first
,
for
*NL*
they
were
both
of
them
dead
,
and
had
been
interred
near
my
habitation
by
*NL*
my
own
hand
;
but
one
of
them
having
multiplied
by
I
know
not
what
kind
of
*NL*
creature
,
these
were
two
which
I
had
preserved
tame
;
whereas
the
rest
ran
*NL*
wild
in
the
woods
,
and
became
indeed
troublesome
to
me
at
last
,
for
they
*NL*
would
often
come
into
my
house
,
and
plunder
me
too
,
till
at
last
I
was
*NL*
obliged
to
shoot
them
,
and
did
kill
a
great
many
;
at
length
they
left
me
.
*NL*
With
this
attendance
and
in
this
plentiful
manner
I
lived
;
neither
could
*NL*
I
be
said
to
want
anything
but
society
;
and
of
that
,
some
time
after
*NL*
this
,
I
was
likely
to
have
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
something
impatient
,
as
I
have
observed
,
to
have
the
use
of
my
*NL*
boat
,
though
very
loath
to
run
any
more
hazards
;
and
therefore
sometimes
*NL*
I
sat
contriving
ways
to
get
her
about
the
island
,
and
at
other
times
I
*NL*
sat
myself
down
contented
enough
without
her
.
But
I
had
a
strange
*NL*
uneasiness
in
my
mind
to
go
down
to
the
point
of
the
island
where
,
as
I
*NL*
have
said
in
my
last
ramble
,
I
went
up
the
hill
to
see
how
the
shore
lay
,
*NL*
and
how
the
current
set
,
that
I
might
see
what
I
had
to
do
:
this
*NL*
inclination
increased
upon
me
every
day
,
and
at
length
I
resolved
to
*NL*
travel
thither
by
land
,
following
the
edge
of
the
shore
.
I
did
so
;
but
*NL*
had
any
one
in
England
met
such
a
man
as
I
was
,
it
must
either
have
*NL*
frightened
him
,
or
raised
a
great
deal
of
laughter
;
and
as
I
frequently
*NL*
stood
still
to
look
at
myself
,
I
could
not
but
smile
at
the
notion
of
my
*NL*
travelling
through
Yorkshire
with
such
an
equipage
,
and
in
such
a
dress
.
*NL*
Be
pleased
to
take
a
sketch
of
my
figure
,
as
follows
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
great
high
shapeless
cap
,
made
of
a
goat
's
skin
,
with
a
flap
*NL*
hanging
down
behind
,
as
well
to
keep
the
sun
from
me
as
to
shoot
the
rain
*NL*
off
from
running
into
my
neck
,
nothing
being
so
hurtful
in
these
climates
*NL*
as
the
rain
upon
the
flesh
under
the
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
short
jacket
of
goat
's
skin
,
the
skirts
coming
down
to
about
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
thighs
,
and
a
pair
of
open-kneed
breeches
of
the
same
;
the
*NL*
breeches
were
made
of
the
skin
of
an
old
he-goat
,
whose
hair
hung
down
*NL*
such
a
length
on
either
side
that
,
like
pantaloons
,
it
reached
to
the
*NL*
middle
of
my
legs
;
stockings
and
shoes
I
had
none
,
but
had
made
me
a
pair
*NL*
of
somethings
,
I
scarce
knew
what
to
call
them
,
like
buskins
,
to
flap
*NL*
over
my
legs
,
and
lace
on
either
side
like
spatterdashes
,
but
of
a
most
*NL*
barbarous
shape
,
as
indeed
were
all
the
rest
of
my
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
on
a
broad
belt
of
goat
's
skin
dried
,
which
I
drew
together
with
*NL*
two
thongs
of
the
same
instead
of
buckles
,
and
in
a
kind
of
a
frog
on
*NL*
either
side
of
this
,
instead
of
a
sword
and
dagger
,
hung
a
little
saw
and
*NL*
a
hatchet
,
one
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other
.
I
had
another
belt
not
*NL*
so
broad
,
and
fastened
in
the
same
manner
,
which
hung
over
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
at
the
end
of
it
,
under
my
left
arm
,
hung
two
pouches
,
both
made
of
*NL*
goat
's
skin
too
,
in
one
of
which
hung
my
powder
,
in
the
other
my
shot
.
*NL*
At
my
back
I
carried
my
basket
,
and
on
my
shoulder
my
gun
,
and
over
my
*NL*
head
a
great
clumsy
,
ugly
,
goat
's
-
skin
umbrella
,
but
which
,
after
all
,
*NL*
was
the
most
necessary
thing
I
had
about
me
next
to
my
gun
.
As
for
my
*NL*
face
,
the
colour
of
it
was
really
not
so
mulatto-like
as
one
might
expect
*NL*
from
a
man
not
at
all
careful
of
it
,
and
living
within
nine
or
ten
*NL*
degrees
of
the
equinox
.
My
beard
I
had
once
suffered
to
grow
till
it
was
*NL*
about
a
quarter
of
a
yard
long
;
but
as
I
had
both
scissors
and
razors
*NL*
sufficient
,
I
had
cut
it
pretty
short
,
except
what
grew
on
my
upper
lip
,
*NL*
which
I
had
trimmed
into
a
large
pair
of
Mahometan
whiskers
,
such
as
I
*NL*
had
seen
worn
by
some
Turks
at
Sallee
,
for
the
Moors
did
not
wear
such
,
*NL*
though
the
Turks
did
;
of
these
moustachios
,
or
whiskers
,
I
will
not
say
*NL*
they
were
long
enough
to
hang
my
hat
upon
them
,
but
they
were
of
a
length
*NL*
and
shape
monstrous
enough
,
and
such
as
in
England
would
have
passed
for
*NL*
frightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
is
by-the-bye
;
for
as
to
my
figure
,
I
had
so
few
to
observe
*NL*
me
that
it
was
of
no
manner
of
consequence
,
so
I
say
no
more
of
that
.
In
*NL*
this
kind
of
dress
I
went
my
new
journey
,
and
was
out
five
or
six
days
.
*NL*
I
travelled
first
along
the
sea-shore
,
directly
to
the
place
where
I
*NL*
first
brought
my
boat
to
an
anchor
to
get
upon
the
rocks
;
and
having
no
*NL*
boat
now
to
take
care
of
,
I
went
over
the
land
a
nearer
way
to
the
same
*NL*
height
that
I
was
upon
before
,
when
,
looking
forward
to
the
points
of
the
*NL*
rocks
which
lay
out
,
and
which
I
was
obliged
to
double
with
my
boat
,
as
*NL*
is
said
above
,
I
was
surprised
to
see
the
sea
all
smooth
and
quiet
--
no
*NL*
rippling
,
no
motion
,
no
current
,
any
more
there
than
in
other
places
.
I
*NL*
was
at
a
strange
loss
to
understand
this
,
and
resolved
to
spend
some
time
*NL*
in
the
observing
it
,
to
see
if
nothing
from
the
sets
of
the
tide
had
*NL*
occasioned
it
;
but
I
was
presently
convinced
how
it
was
--
viz
.
that
the
*NL*
tide
of
ebb
setting
from
the
west
,
and
joining
with
the
current
of
waters
*NL*
from
some
great
river
on
the
shore
,
must
be
the
occasion
of
this
current
,
*NL*
and
that
,
according
as
the
wind
blew
more
forcibly
from
the
west
or
from
*NL*
the
north
,
this
current
came
nearer
or
went
farther
from
the
shore
;
for
,
*NL*
waiting
thereabouts
till
evening
,
I
went
up
to
the
rock
again
,
and
then
*NL*
the
tide
of
ebb
being
made
,
I
plainly
saw
the
current
again
as
before
,
*NL*
only
that
it
ran
farther
off
,
being
near
half
a
league
from
the
shore
,
*NL*
whereas
in
my
case
it
set
close
upon
the
shore
,
and
hurried
me
and
my
*NL*
canoe
along
with
it
,
which
at
another
time
it
would
not
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
observation
convinced
me
that
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
observe
the
*NL*
ebbing
and
the
flowing
of
the
tide
,
and
I
might
very
easily
bring
my
boat
*NL*
about
the
island
again
;
but
when
I
began
to
think
of
putting
it
in
*NL*
practice
,
I
had
such
terror
upon
my
spirits
at
the
remembrance
of
the
*NL*
danger
I
had
been
in
,
that
I
could
not
think
of
it
again
with
any
*NL*
patience
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
took
up
another
resolution
,
which
was
*NL*
more
safe
,
though
more
laborious
--
and
this
was
,
that
I
would
build
,
or
*NL*
rather
make
,
me
another
periagua
or
canoe
,
and
so
have
one
for
one
side
*NL*
of
the
island
,
and
one
for
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
to
understand
that
now
I
had
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
two
plantations
*NL*
in
the
island
--
one
my
little
fortification
or
tent
,
with
the
wall
about
*NL*
it
,
under
the
rock
,
with
the
cave
behind
me
,
which
by
this
time
I
had
*NL*
enlarged
into
several
apartments
or
caves
,
one
within
another
.
One
of
*NL*
these
,
which
was
the
driest
and
largest
,
and
had
a
door
out
beyond
my
*NL*
wall
or
fortification
--
that
is
to
say
,
beyond
where
my
wall
joined
to
the
*NL*
rock
--
was
all
filled
up
with
the
large
earthen
pots
of
which
I
have
given
*NL*
an
account
,
and
with
fourteen
or
fifteen
great
baskets
,
which
would
hold
*NL*
five
or
six
bushels
each
,
where
I
laid
up
my
stores
of
provisions
,
*NL*
especially
my
corn
,
some
in
the
ear
,
cut
off
short
from
the
straw
,
and
*NL*
the
other
rubbed
out
with
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
my
wall
,
made
,
as
before
,
with
long
stakes
or
piles
,
those
piles
*NL*
grew
all
like
trees
,
and
were
by
this
time
grown
so
big
,
and
spread
so
*NL*
very
much
,
that
there
was
not
the
least
appearance
,
to
any
one
's
view
,
of
*NL*
any
habitation
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
this
dwelling
of
mine
,
but
a
little
farther
within
the
land
,
and
*NL*
upon
lower
ground
,
lay
my
two
pieces
of
corn
land
,
which
I
kept
duly
*NL*
cultivated
and
sowed
,
and
which
duly
yielded
me
their
harvest
in
its
*NL*
season
;
and
whenever
I
had
occasion
for
more
corn
,
I
had
more
land
*NL*
adjoining
as
fit
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
I
had
my
country
seat
,
and
I
had
now
a
tolerable
plantation
*NL*
there
also
;
for
,
first
,
I
had
my
little
bower
,
as
I
called
it
,
which
I
*NL*
kept
in
repair
--
that
is
to
say
,
I
kept
the
hedge
which
encircled
it
in
*NL*
constantly
fitted
up
to
its
usual
height
,
the
ladder
standing
always
in
*NL*
the
inside
.
I
kept
the
trees
,
which
at
first
were
no
more
than
stakes
,
*NL*
but
were
now
grown
very
firm
and
tall
,
always
cut
,
so
that
they
might
*NL*
spread
and
grow
thick
and
wild
,
and
make
the
more
agreeable
shade
,
which
*NL*
they
did
effectually
to
my
mind
.
In
the
middle
of
this
I
had
my
tent
*NL*
always
standing
,
being
a
piece
of
a
sail
spread
over
poles
,
set
up
for
*NL*
that
purpose
,
and
which
never
wanted
any
repair
or
renewing
;
and
under
*NL*
this
I
had
made
me
a
squab
or
couch
with
the
skins
of
the
creatures
I
had
*NL*
killed
,
and
with
other
soft
things
,
and
a
blanket
laid
on
them
,
such
as
*NL*
belonged
to
our
sea-bedding
,
which
I
had
saved
;
and
a
great
watch-coat
to
*NL*
cover
me
.
And
here
,
whenever
I
had
occasion
to
be
absent
from
my
chief
*NL*
seat
,
I
took
up
my
country
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adjoining
to
this
I
had
my
enclosures
for
my
cattle
,
that
is
to
say
my
*NL*
goats
,
and
I
had
taken
an
inconceivable
deal
of
pains
to
fence
and
*NL*
enclose
this
ground
.
I
was
so
anxious
to
see
it
kept
entire
,
lest
the
*NL*
goats
should
break
through
,
that
I
never
left
off
till
,
with
infinite
*NL*
labour
,
I
had
stuck
the
outside
of
the
hedge
so
full
of
small
stakes
,
and
*NL*
so
near
to
one
another
,
that
it
was
rather
a
pale
than
a
hedge
,
and
there
*NL*
was
scarce
room
to
put
a
hand
through
between
them
;
which
afterwards
,
*NL*
when
those
stakes
grew
,
as
they
all
did
in
the
next
rainy
season
,
made
*NL*
the
enclosure
strong
like
a
wall
,
indeed
stronger
than
any
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
will
testify
for
me
that
I
was
not
idle
,
and
that
I
spared
no
pains
*NL*
to
bring
to
pass
whatever
appeared
necessary
for
my
comfortable
support
,
*NL*
for
I
considered
the
keeping
up
a
breed
of
tame
creatures
thus
at
my
hand
*NL*
would
be
a
living
magazine
of
flesh
,
milk
,
butter
,
and
cheese
for
me
as
*NL*
long
as
I
lived
in
the
place
,
if
it
were
to
be
forty
years
;
and
that
*NL*
keeping
them
in
my
reach
depended
entirely
upon
my
perfecting
my
*NL*
enclosures
to
such
a
degree
that
I
might
be
sure
of
keeping
them
*NL*
together
;
which
by
this
method
,
indeed
,
I
so
effectually
secured
,
that
*NL*
when
these
little
stakes
began
to
grow
,
I
had
planted
them
so
very
thick
*NL*
that
I
was
forced
to
pull
some
of
them
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
place
also
I
had
my
grapes
growing
,
which
I
principally
depended
*NL*
on
for
my
winter
store
of
raisins
,
and
which
I
never
failed
to
preserve
*NL*
very
carefully
,
as
the
best
and
most
agreeable
dainty
of
my
whole
diet
;
*NL*
and
indeed
they
were
not
only
agreeable
,
but
medicinal
,
wholesome
,
*NL*
nourishing
,
and
refreshing
to
the
last
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
was
also
about
half-way
between
my
other
habitation
and
the
place
*NL*
where
I
had
laid
up
my
boat
,
I
generally
stayed
and
lay
here
in
my
way
*NL*
thither
,
for
I
used
frequently
to
visit
my
boat
;
and
I
kept
all
things
*NL*
about
or
belonging
to
her
in
very
good
order
.
Sometimes
I
went
out
in
*NL*
her
to
divert
myself
,
but
no
more
hazardous
voyages
would
I
go
,
scarcely
*NL*
ever
above
a
stone
's
cast
or
two
from
the
shore
,
I
was
so
apprehensive
of
*NL*
being
hurried
out
of
my
knowledge
again
by
the
currents
or
winds
,
or
any
*NL*
other
accident
.
But
now
I
come
to
a
new
scene
of
my
life
.
It
happened
*NL*
one
day
,
about
noon
,
going
towards
my
boat
,
I
was
exceedingly
surprised
*NL*
with
the
print
of
a
man
's
naked
foot
on
the
shore
,
which
was
very
plain
*NL*
to
be
seen
on
the
sand
.
I
stood
like
one
thunderstruck
,
or
as
if
I
had
*NL*
seen
an
apparition
.
I
listened
,
I
looked
round
me
,
but
I
could
hear
*NL*
nothing
,
nor
see
anything
;
I
went
up
to
a
rising
ground
to
look
farther
;
*NL*
I
went
up
the
shore
and
down
the
shore
,
but
it
was
all
one
;
I
could
see
*NL*
no
other
impression
but
that
one
.
I
went
to
it
again
to
see
if
there
*NL*
were
any
more
,
and
to
observe
if
it
might
not
be
my
fancy
;
but
there
was
*NL*
no
room
for
that
,
for
there
was
exactly
the
print
of
a
foot
--
toes
,
heel
,
*NL*
and
every
part
of
a
foot
.
How
it
came
thither
I
knew
not
,
nor
could
I
in
*NL*
the
least
imagine
;
but
after
innumerable
fluttering
thoughts
,
like
a
man
*NL*
perfectly
confused
and
out
of
myself
,
I
came
home
to
my
fortification
,
*NL*
not
feeling
,
as
we
say
,
the
ground
I
went
on
,
but
terrified
to
the
last
*NL*
degree
,
looking
behind
me
at
every
two
or
three
steps
,
mistaking
every
*NL*
bush
and
tree
,
and
fancying
every
stump
at
a
distance
to
be
a
man
.
Nor
*NL*
is
it
possible
to
describe
how
many
various
shapes
my
affrighted
*NL*
imagination
represented
things
to
me
in
,
how
many
wild
ideas
were
found
*NL*
every
moment
in
my
fancy
,
and
what
strange
,
unaccountable
whimsies
came
*NL*
into
my
thoughts
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
my
castle
-LRB-
for
so
I
think
I
called
it
ever
after
this
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
fled
into
it
like
one
pursued
.
Whether
I
went
over
by
the
ladder
,
as
*NL*
first
contrived
,
or
went
in
at
the
hole
in
the
rock
,
which
I
had
called
a
*NL*
door
,
I
can
not
remember
;
no
,
nor
could
I
remember
the
next
morning
,
for
*NL*
never
frightened
hare
fled
to
cover
,
or
fox
to
earth
,
with
more
terror
of
*NL*
mind
than
I
to
this
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
slept
none
that
night
;
the
farther
I
was
from
the
occasion
of
my
*NL*
fright
,
the
greater
my
apprehensions
were
,
which
is
something
contrary
to
*NL*
the
nature
of
such
things
,
and
especially
to
the
usual
practice
of
all
*NL*
creatures
in
fear
;
but
I
was
so
embarrassed
with
my
own
frightful
ideas
*NL*
of
the
thing
,
that
I
formed
nothing
but
dismal
imaginations
to
myself
,
*NL*
even
though
I
was
now
a
great
way
off
.
Sometimes
I
fancied
it
must
be
*NL*
the
devil
,
and
reason
joined
in
with
me
in
this
supposition
,
for
how
*NL*
should
any
other
thing
in
human
shape
come
into
the
place
?
Where
was
the
*NL*
vessel
that
brought
them
?
What
marks
were
there
of
any
other
footstep
?
*NL*
And
how
was
it
possible
a
man
should
come
there
?
But
then
,
to
think
that
*NL*
Satan
should
take
human
shape
upon
him
in
such
a
place
,
where
there
could
*NL*
be
no
manner
of
occasion
for
it
,
but
to
leave
the
print
of
his
foot
*NL*
behind
him
,
and
that
even
for
no
purpose
too
,
for
he
could
not
be
sure
I
*NL*
should
see
it
--
this
was
an
amusement
the
other
way
.
I
considered
that
*NL*
the
devil
might
have
found
out
abundance
of
other
ways
to
have
terrified
*NL*
me
than
this
of
the
single
print
of
a
foot
;
that
as
I
lived
quite
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
island
,
he
would
never
have
been
so
simple
as
to
leave
*NL*
a
mark
in
a
place
where
it
was
ten
thousand
to
one
whether
I
should
ever
*NL*
see
it
or
not
,
and
in
the
sand
too
,
which
the
first
surge
of
the
sea
,
*NL*
upon
a
high
wind
,
would
have
defaced
entirely
.
All
this
seemed
*NL*
inconsistent
with
the
thing
itself
and
with
all
the
notions
we
usually
*NL*
entertain
of
the
subtlety
of
the
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Abundance
of
such
things
as
these
assisted
to
argue
me
out
of
all
*NL*
apprehensions
of
its
being
the
devil
;
and
I
presently
concluded
then
that
*NL*
it
must
be
some
more
dangerous
creature
--
viz
.
that
it
must
be
some
of
the
*NL*
savages
of
the
mainland
opposite
who
had
wandered
out
to
sea
in
their
*NL*
canoes
,
and
either
driven
by
the
currents
or
by
contrary
winds
,
had
made
*NL*
the
island
,
and
had
been
on
shore
,
but
were
gone
away
again
to
sea
;
being
*NL*
as
loath
,
perhaps
,
to
have
stayed
in
this
desolate
island
as
I
would
have
*NL*
been
to
have
had
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
reflections
were
rolling
in
my
mind
,
I
was
very
thankful
in
*NL*
my
thoughts
that
I
was
so
happy
as
not
to
be
thereabouts
at
that
time
,
or
*NL*
that
they
did
not
see
my
boat
,
by
which
they
would
have
concluded
that
*NL*
some
inhabitants
had
been
in
the
place
,
and
perhaps
have
searched
farther
*NL*
for
me
.
Then
terrible
thoughts
racked
my
imagination
about
their
having
*NL*
found
out
my
boat
,
and
that
there
were
people
here
;
and
that
,
if
so
,
I
*NL*
should
certainly
have
them
come
again
in
greater
numbers
and
devour
me
;
*NL*
that
if
it
should
happen
that
they
should
not
find
me
,
yet
they
would
*NL*
find
my
enclosure
,
destroy
all
my
corn
,
and
carry
away
all
my
flock
of
*NL*
tame
goats
,
and
I
should
perish
at
last
for
mere
want
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
my
fear
banished
all
my
religious
hope
,
all
that
former
confidence
*NL*
in
God
,
which
was
founded
upon
such
wonderful
experience
as
I
had
had
of
*NL*
His
goodness
;
as
if
He
that
had
fed
me
by
miracle
hitherto
could
not
*NL*
preserve
,
by
His
power
,
the
provision
which
He
had
made
for
me
by
His
*NL*
goodness
.
I
reproached
myself
with
my
laziness
,
that
would
not
sow
any
*NL*
more
corn
one
year
than
would
just
serve
me
till
the
next
season
,
as
if
*NL*
no
accident
could
intervene
to
prevent
my
enjoying
the
crop
that
was
upon
*NL*
the
ground
;
and
this
I
thought
so
just
a
reproof
,
that
I
resolved
for
the
*NL*
future
to
have
two
or
three
years
'
corn
beforehand
;
so
that
,
whatever
*NL*
might
come
,
I
might
not
perish
for
want
of
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
strange
a
chequer-work
of
Providence
is
the
life
of
man
!
and
by
what
*NL*
secret
different
springs
are
the
affections
hurried
about
,
as
different
*NL*
circumstances
present
!
To-day
we
love
what
to-morrow
we
hate
;
to-day
we
*NL*
seek
what
to-morrow
we
shun
;
to-day
we
desire
what
to-morrow
we
fear
,
*NL*
nay
,
even
tremble
at
the
apprehensions
of
.
This
was
exemplified
in
me
,
*NL*
at
this
time
,
in
the
most
lively
manner
imaginable
;
for
I
,
whose
only
*NL*
affliction
was
that
I
seemed
banished
from
human
society
,
that
I
was
*NL*
alone
,
circumscribed
by
the
boundless
ocean
,
cut
off
from
mankind
,
and
*NL*
condemned
to
what
I
call
silent
life
;
that
I
was
as
one
whom
Heaven
*NL*
thought
not
worthy
to
be
numbered
among
the
living
,
or
to
appear
among
*NL*
the
rest
of
His
creatures
;
that
to
have
seen
one
of
my
own
species
would
*NL*
have
seemed
to
me
a
raising
me
from
death
to
life
,
and
the
greatest
*NL*
blessing
that
Heaven
itself
,
next
to
the
supreme
blessing
of
salvation
,
*NL*
could
bestow
;
I
say
,
that
I
should
now
tremble
at
the
very
apprehensions
*NL*
of
seeing
a
man
,
and
was
ready
to
sink
into
the
ground
at
but
the
shadow
*NL*
or
silent
appearance
of
a
man
having
set
his
foot
in
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
the
uneven
state
of
human
life
;
and
it
afforded
me
a
great
many
*NL*
curious
speculations
afterwards
,
when
I
had
a
little
recovered
my
first
*NL*
surprise
.
I
considered
that
this
was
the
station
of
life
the
infinitely
*NL*
wise
and
good
providence
of
God
had
determined
for
me
;
that
as
I
could
*NL*
not
foresee
what
the
ends
of
Divine
wisdom
might
be
in
all
this
,
so
I
was
*NL*
not
to
dispute
His
sovereignty
;
who
,
as
I
was
His
creature
,
had
an
*NL*
undoubted
right
,
by
creation
,
to
govern
and
dispose
of
me
absolutely
as
*NL*
He
thought
fit
;
and
who
,
as
I
was
a
creature
that
had
offended
Him
,
had
*NL*
likewise
a
judicial
right
to
condemn
me
to
what
punishment
He
thought
*NL*
fit
;
and
that
it
was
my
part
to
submit
to
bear
His
indignation
,
because
I
*NL*
had
sinned
against
Him
.
I
then
reflected
,
that
as
God
,
who
was
not
only
*NL*
righteous
but
omnipotent
,
had
thought
fit
thus
to
punish
and
afflict
me
,
*NL*
so
He
was
able
to
deliver
me
:
that
if
He
did
not
think
fit
to
do
so
,
it
*NL*
was
my
unquestioned
duty
to
resign
myself
absolutely
and
entirely
to
His
*NL*
will
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
was
my
duty
also
to
hope
in
Him
,
pray
to
*NL*
Him
,
and
quietly
to
attend
to
the
dictates
and
directions
of
His
daily
*NL*
providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
took
me
up
many
hours
,
days
,
nay
,
I
may
say
weeks
and
*NL*
months
:
and
one
particular
effect
of
my
cogitations
on
this
occasion
I
*NL*
can
not
omit
.
One
morning
early
,
lying
in
my
bed
,
and
filled
with
*NL*
thoughts
about
my
danger
from
the
appearances
of
savages
,
I
found
it
*NL*
discomposed
me
very
much
;
upon
which
these
words
of
the
Scripture
came
*NL*
into
my
thoughts
,
``
Call
upon
Me
in
the
day
of
trouble
,
and
I
will
deliver
*NL*
thee
,
and
thou
shalt
glorify
Me
.
''
Upon
this
,
rising
cheerfully
out
of
my
*NL*
bed
,
my
heart
was
not
only
comforted
,
but
I
was
guided
and
encouraged
to
*NL*
pray
earnestly
to
God
for
deliverance
:
when
I
had
done
praying
I
took
up
*NL*
my
Bible
,
and
opening
it
to
read
,
the
first
words
that
presented
to
me
*NL*
were
,
``
Wait
on
the
Lord
,
and
be
of
good
cheer
,
and
He
shall
strengthen
*NL*
thy
heart
;
wait
,
I
say
,
on
the
Lord
.
''
It
is
impossible
to
express
the
*NL*
comfort
this
gave
me
.
In
answer
,
I
thankfully
laid
down
the
book
,
and
*NL*
was
no
more
sad
,
at
least
on
that
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
these
cogitations
,
apprehensions
,
and
reflections
,
it
*NL*
came
into
my
thoughts
one
day
that
all
this
might
be
a
mere
chimera
of
my
*NL*
own
,
and
that
this
foot
might
be
the
print
of
my
own
foot
,
when
I
came
on
*NL*
shore
from
my
boat
:
this
cheered
me
up
a
little
,
too
,
and
I
began
to
*NL*
persuade
myself
it
was
all
a
delusion
;
that
it
was
nothing
else
but
my
*NL*
own
foot
;
and
why
might
I
not
come
that
way
from
the
boat
,
as
well
as
I
*NL*
was
going
that
way
to
the
boat
?
Again
,
I
considered
also
that
I
could
by
*NL*
no
means
tell
for
certain
where
I
had
trod
,
and
where
I
had
not
;
and
that
*NL*
if
,
at
last
,
this
was
only
the
print
of
my
own
foot
,
I
had
played
the
*NL*
part
of
those
fools
who
try
to
make
stories
of
spectres
and
apparitions
,
*NL*
and
then
are
frightened
at
them
more
than
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
began
to
take
courage
,
and
to
peep
abroad
again
,
for
I
had
not
*NL*
stirred
out
of
my
castle
for
three
days
and
nights
,
so
that
I
began
to
*NL*
starve
for
provisions
;
for
I
had
little
or
nothing
within
doors
but
some
*NL*
barley-cakes
and
water
;
then
I
knew
that
my
goats
wanted
to
be
milked
*NL*
too
,
which
usually
was
my
evening
diversion
:
and
the
poor
creatures
were
*NL*
in
great
pain
and
inconvenience
for
want
of
it
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
almost
*NL*
spoiled
some
of
them
,
and
almost
dried
up
their
milk
.
Encouraging
*NL*
myself
,
therefore
,
with
the
belief
that
this
was
nothing
but
the
print
of
*NL*
one
of
my
own
feet
,
and
that
I
might
be
truly
said
to
start
at
my
own
*NL*
shadow
,
I
began
to
go
abroad
again
,
and
went
to
my
country
house
to
milk
*NL*
my
flock
:
but
to
see
with
what
fear
I
went
forward
,
how
often
I
looked
*NL*
behind
me
,
how
I
was
ready
every
now
and
then
to
lay
down
my
basket
and
*NL*
run
for
my
life
,
it
would
have
made
any
one
have
thought
I
was
haunted
*NL*
with
an
evil
conscience
,
or
that
I
had
been
lately
most
terribly
*NL*
frightened
;
and
so
,
indeed
,
I
had
.
However
,
I
went
down
thus
two
or
*NL*
three
days
,
and
having
seen
nothing
,
I
began
to
be
a
little
bolder
,
and
*NL*
to
think
there
was
really
nothing
in
it
but
my
own
imagination
;
but
I
*NL*
could
not
persuade
myself
fully
of
this
till
I
should
go
down
to
the
*NL*
shore
again
,
and
see
this
print
of
a
foot
,
and
measure
it
by
my
own
,
and
*NL*
see
if
there
was
any
similitude
or
fitness
,
that
I
might
be
assured
it
*NL*
was
my
own
foot
:
but
when
I
came
to
the
place
,
first
,
it
appeared
*NL*
evidently
to
me
,
that
when
I
laid
up
my
boat
I
could
not
possibly
be
on
*NL*
shore
anywhere
thereabouts
;
secondly
,
when
I
came
to
measure
the
mark
*NL*
with
my
own
foot
,
I
found
my
foot
not
so
large
by
a
great
deal
.
Both
*NL*
these
things
filled
my
head
with
new
imaginations
,
and
gave
me
the
*NL*
vapours
again
to
the
highest
degree
,
so
that
I
shook
with
cold
like
one
*NL*
in
an
ague
;
and
I
went
home
again
,
filled
with
the
belief
that
some
man
*NL*
or
men
had
been
on
shore
there
;
or
,
in
short
,
that
the
island
was
*NL*
inhabited
,
and
I
might
be
surprised
before
I
was
aware
;
and
what
course
*NL*
to
take
for
my
security
I
knew
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
what
ridiculous
resolutions
men
take
when
possessed
with
fear
!
It
*NL*
deprives
them
of
the
use
of
those
means
which
reason
offers
for
their
*NL*
relief
.
The
first
thing
I
proposed
to
myself
was
,
to
throw
down
my
*NL*
enclosures
,
and
turn
all
my
tame
cattle
wild
into
the
woods
,
lest
the
*NL*
enemy
should
find
them
,
and
then
frequent
the
island
in
prospect
of
the
*NL*
same
or
the
like
booty
:
then
the
simple
thing
of
digging
up
my
two
*NL*
corn-fields
,
lest
they
should
find
such
a
grain
there
,
and
still
be
*NL*
prompted
to
frequent
the
island
:
then
to
demolish
my
bower
and
tent
,
that
*NL*
they
might
not
see
any
vestiges
of
habitation
,
and
be
prompted
to
look
*NL*
farther
,
in
order
to
find
out
the
persons
inhabiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
subject
of
the
first
night
's
cogitations
after
I
was
come
*NL*
home
again
,
while
the
apprehensions
which
had
so
overrun
my
mind
were
*NL*
fresh
upon
me
,
and
my
head
was
full
of
vapours
.
Thus
,
fear
of
danger
is
*NL*
ten
thousand
times
more
terrifying
than
danger
itself
,
when
apparent
to
*NL*
the
eyes
;
and
we
find
the
burden
of
anxiety
greater
,
by
much
,
than
the
*NL*
evil
which
we
are
anxious
about
:
and
what
was
worse
than
all
this
,
I
had
*NL*
not
that
relief
in
this
trouble
that
from
the
resignation
I
used
to
*NL*
practise
I
hoped
to
have
.
I
looked
,
I
thought
,
like
Saul
,
who
complained
*NL*
not
only
that
the
Philistines
were
upon
him
,
but
that
God
had
forsaken
*NL*
him
;
for
I
did
not
now
take
due
ways
to
compose
my
mind
,
by
crying
to
God
*NL*
in
my
distress
,
and
resting
upon
His
providence
,
as
I
had
done
before
,
*NL*
for
my
defence
and
deliverance
;
which
,
if
I
had
done
,
I
had
at
least
been
*NL*
more
cheerfully
supported
under
this
new
surprise
,
and
perhaps
carried
*NL*
through
it
with
more
resolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
confusion
of
my
thoughts
kept
me
awake
all
night
;
but
in
the
morning
*NL*
I
fell
asleep
;
and
having
,
by
the
amusement
of
my
mind
,
been
as
it
were
*NL*
tired
,
and
my
spirits
exhausted
,
I
slept
very
soundly
,
and
waked
much
*NL*
better
composed
than
I
had
ever
been
before
.
And
now
I
began
to
think
*NL*
sedately
;
and
,
upon
debate
with
myself
,
I
concluded
that
this
island
*NL*
-LRB-
which
was
so
exceedingly
pleasant
,
fruitful
,
and
no
farther
from
the
*NL*
mainland
than
as
I
had
seen
-RRB-
was
not
so
entirely
abandoned
as
I
might
*NL*
imagine
;
that
although
there
were
no
stated
inhabitants
who
lived
on
the
*NL*
spot
,
yet
that
there
might
sometimes
come
boats
off
from
the
shore
,
who
,
*NL*
either
with
design
,
or
perhaps
never
but
when
they
were
driven
by
cross
*NL*
winds
,
might
come
to
this
place
;
that
I
had
lived
there
fifteen
years
now
*NL*
and
had
not
met
with
the
least
shadow
or
figure
of
any
people
yet
;
and
*NL*
that
,
if
at
any
time
they
should
be
driven
here
,
it
was
probable
they
*NL*
went
away
again
as
soon
as
ever
they
could
,
seeing
they
had
never
thought
*NL*
fit
to
fix
here
upon
any
occasion
;
that
the
most
I
could
suggest
any
*NL*
danger
from
was
from
any
casual
accidental
landing
of
straggling
people
*NL*
from
the
main
,
who
,
as
it
was
likely
,
if
they
were
driven
hither
,
were
*NL*
here
against
their
wills
,
so
they
made
no
stay
here
,
but
went
off
again
*NL*
with
all
possible
speed
;
seldom
staying
one
night
on
shore
,
lest
they
*NL*
should
not
have
the
help
of
the
tides
and
daylight
back
again
;
and
that
,
*NL*
therefore
,
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
consider
of
some
safe
retreat
,
in
*NL*
case
I
should
see
any
savages
land
upon
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
I
began
sorely
to
repent
that
I
had
dug
my
cave
so
large
as
to
bring
*NL*
a
door
through
again
,
which
door
,
as
I
said
,
came
out
beyond
where
my
*NL*
fortification
joined
to
the
rock
:
upon
maturely
considering
this
,
*NL*
therefore
,
I
resolved
to
draw
me
a
second
fortification
,
in
the
manner
of
*NL*
a
semicircle
,
at
a
distance
from
my
wall
,
just
where
I
had
planted
a
*NL*
double
row
of
trees
about
twelve
years
before
,
of
which
I
made
mention
:
*NL*
these
trees
having
been
planted
so
thick
before
,
they
wanted
but
few
*NL*
piles
to
be
driven
between
them
,
that
they
might
be
thicker
and
stronger
,
*NL*
and
my
wall
would
be
soon
finished
.
So
that
I
had
now
a
double
wall
;
and
*NL*
my
outer
wall
was
thickened
with
pieces
of
timber
,
old
cables
,
and
*NL*
everything
I
could
think
of
,
to
make
it
strong
;
having
in
it
seven
little
*NL*
holes
,
about
as
big
as
I
might
put
my
arm
out
at
.
In
the
inside
of
this
*NL*
I
thickened
my
wall
to
about
ten
feet
thick
with
continually
bringing
*NL*
earth
out
of
my
cave
,
and
laying
it
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
,
and
walking
*NL*
upon
it
;
and
through
the
seven
holes
I
contrived
to
plant
the
muskets
,
of
*NL*
which
I
took
notice
that
I
had
got
seven
on
shore
out
of
the
ship
;
these
*NL*
I
planted
like
my
cannon
,
and
fitted
them
into
frames
,
that
held
them
*NL*
like
a
carriage
,
so
that
I
could
fire
all
the
seven
guns
in
two
minutes
'
*NL*
time
;
this
wall
I
was
many
a
weary
month
in
finishing
,
and
yet
never
*NL*
thought
myself
safe
till
it
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
was
done
I
stuck
all
the
ground
without
my
wall
,
for
a
great
*NL*
length
every
way
,
as
full
with
stakes
or
sticks
of
the
osier-like
wood
,
*NL*
which
I
found
so
apt
to
grow
,
as
they
could
well
stand
;
insomuch
that
I
*NL*
believe
I
might
set
in
near
twenty
thousand
of
them
,
leaving
a
pretty
*NL*
large
space
between
them
and
my
wall
,
that
I
might
have
room
to
see
an
*NL*
enemy
,
and
they
might
have
no
shelter
from
the
young
trees
,
if
they
*NL*
attempted
to
approach
my
outer
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
in
two
years
'
time
I
had
a
thick
grove
;
and
in
five
or
six
years
'
*NL*
time
I
had
a
wood
before
my
dwelling
,
growing
so
monstrously
thick
and
*NL*
strong
that
it
was
indeed
perfectly
impassable
:
and
no
men
,
of
what
kind
*NL*
soever
,
could
ever
imagine
that
there
was
anything
beyond
it
,
much
less
a
*NL*
habitation
.
As
for
the
way
which
I
proposed
to
myself
to
go
in
and
out
*NL*
-LRB-
for
I
left
no
avenue
-RRB-
,
it
was
by
setting
two
ladders
,
one
to
a
part
of
*NL*
the
rock
which
was
low
,
and
then
broke
in
,
and
left
room
to
place
another
*NL*
ladder
upon
that
;
so
when
the
two
ladders
were
taken
down
no
man
living
*NL*
could
come
down
to
me
without
doing
himself
mischief
;
and
if
they
had
*NL*
come
down
,
they
were
still
on
the
outside
of
my
outer
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
took
all
the
measures
human
prudence
could
suggest
for
my
own
*NL*
preservation
;
and
it
will
be
seen
at
length
that
they
were
not
altogether
*NL*
without
just
reason
;
though
I
foresaw
nothing
at
that
time
more
than
my
*NL*
mere
fear
suggested
to
me
.

CHAPTER
XII
--
A
CAVE
RETREAT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
doing
,
I
was
not
altogether
careless
of
my
other
affairs
;
*NL*
for
I
had
a
great
concern
upon
me
for
my
little
herd
of
goats
:
they
were
*NL*
not
only
a
ready
supply
to
me
on
every
occasion
,
and
began
to
be
*NL*
sufficient
for
me
,
without
the
expense
of
powder
and
shot
,
but
also
*NL*
without
the
fatigue
of
hunting
after
the
wild
ones
;
and
I
was
loath
to
*NL*
lose
the
advantage
of
them
,
and
to
have
them
all
to
nurse
up
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
purpose
,
after
long
consideration
,
I
could
think
of
but
two
ways
*NL*
to
preserve
them
:
one
was
,
to
find
another
convenient
place
to
dig
a
cave
*NL*
underground
,
and
to
drive
them
into
it
every
night
;
and
the
other
was
to
*NL*
enclose
two
or
three
little
bits
of
land
,
remote
from
one
another
,
and
as
*NL*
much
concealed
as
I
could
,
where
I
might
keep
about
half-a-dozen
young
*NL*
goats
in
each
place
;
so
that
if
any
disaster
happened
to
the
flock
in
*NL*
general
,
I
might
be
able
to
raise
them
again
with
little
trouble
and
*NL*
time
:
and
this
though
it
would
require
a
good
deal
of
time
and
labour
,
I
*NL*
thought
was
the
most
rational
design
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
I
spent
some
time
to
find
out
the
most
retired
parts
of
the
*NL*
island
;
and
I
pitched
upon
one
,
which
was
as
private
,
indeed
,
as
my
heart
*NL*
could
wish
:
it
was
a
little
damp
piece
of
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
hollow
and
thick
woods
,
where
,
as
is
observed
,
I
almost
lost
myself
once
*NL*
before
,
endeavouring
to
come
back
that
way
from
the
eastern
part
of
the
*NL*
island
.
Here
I
found
a
clear
piece
of
land
,
near
three
acres
,
so
*NL*
surrounded
with
woods
that
it
was
almost
an
enclosure
by
nature
;
at
*NL*
least
,
it
did
not
want
near
so
much
labour
to
make
it
so
as
the
other
*NL*
piece
of
ground
I
had
worked
so
hard
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
immediately
went
to
work
with
this
piece
of
ground
;
and
in
less
than
a
*NL*
month
's
time
I
had
so
fenced
it
round
that
my
flock
,
or
herd
,
call
it
*NL*
which
you
please
,
which
were
not
so
wild
now
as
at
first
they
might
be
*NL*
supposed
to
be
,
were
well
enough
secured
in
it
:
so
,
without
any
further
*NL*
delay
,
I
removed
ten
young
she-goats
and
two
he-goats
to
this
piece
,
and
*NL*
when
they
were
there
I
continued
to
perfect
the
fence
till
I
had
made
it
*NL*
as
secure
as
the
other
;
which
,
however
,
I
did
at
more
leisure
,
and
it
*NL*
took
me
up
more
time
by
a
great
deal
.
All
this
labour
I
was
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
,
purely
from
my
apprehensions
on
account
of
the
print
of
a
*NL*
man
's
foot
;
for
as
yet
I
had
never
seen
any
human
creature
come
near
the
*NL*
island
;
and
I
had
now
lived
two
years
under
this
uneasiness
,
which
,
*NL*
indeed
,
made
my
life
much
less
comfortable
than
it
was
before
,
as
may
be
*NL*
well
imagined
by
any
who
know
what
it
is
to
live
in
the
constant
snare
of
*NL*
the
fear
of
man
.
And
this
I
must
observe
,
with
grief
,
too
,
that
the
*NL*
discomposure
of
my
mind
had
great
impression
also
upon
the
religious
part
*NL*
of
my
thoughts
;
for
the
dread
and
terror
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
*NL*
savages
and
cannibals
lay
so
upon
my
spirits
,
that
I
seldom
found
myself
*NL*
in
a
due
temper
for
application
to
my
Maker
;
at
least
,
not
with
the
*NL*
sedate
calmness
and
resignation
of
soul
which
I
was
wont
to
do
:
I
rather
*NL*
prayed
to
God
as
under
great
affliction
and
pressure
of
mind
,
surrounded
*NL*
with
danger
,
and
in
expectation
every
night
of
being
murdered
and
*NL*
devoured
before
morning
;
and
I
must
testify
,
from
my
experience
,
that
a
*NL*
temper
of
peace
,
thankfulness
,
love
,
and
affection
,
is
much
the
more
*NL*
proper
frame
for
prayer
than
that
of
terror
and
discomposure
:
and
that
*NL*
under
the
dread
of
mischief
impending
,
a
man
is
no
more
fit
for
a
*NL*
comforting
performance
of
the
duty
of
praying
to
God
than
he
is
for
a
*NL*
repentance
on
a
sick-bed
;
for
these
discomposures
affect
the
mind
,
as
the
*NL*
others
do
the
body
;
and
the
discomposure
of
the
mind
must
necessarily
be
*NL*
as
great
a
disability
as
that
of
the
body
,
and
much
greater
;
praying
to
*NL*
God
being
properly
an
act
of
the
mind
,
not
of
the
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
go
on
.
After
I
had
thus
secured
one
part
of
my
little
living
*NL*
stock
,
I
went
about
the
whole
island
,
searching
for
another
private
place
*NL*
to
make
such
another
deposit
;
when
,
wandering
more
to
the
west
point
of
*NL*
the
island
than
I
had
ever
done
yet
,
and
looking
out
to
sea
,
I
thought
I
*NL*
saw
a
boat
upon
the
sea
,
at
a
great
distance
.
I
had
found
a
perspective
*NL*
glass
or
two
in
one
of
the
seamen
's
chests
,
which
I
saved
out
of
our
*NL*
ship
,
but
I
had
it
not
about
me
;
and
this
was
so
remote
that
I
could
not
*NL*
tell
what
to
make
of
it
,
though
I
looked
at
it
till
my
eyes
were
not
able
*NL*
to
hold
to
look
any
longer
;
whether
it
was
a
boat
or
not
I
do
not
know
,
*NL*
but
as
I
descended
from
the
hill
I
could
see
no
more
of
it
,
so
I
gave
it
*NL*
over
;
only
I
resolved
to
go
no
more
out
without
a
perspective
glass
in
my
*NL*
pocket
.
When
I
was
come
down
the
hill
to
the
end
of
the
island
,
where
,
*NL*
indeed
,
I
had
never
been
before
,
I
was
presently
convinced
that
the
*NL*
seeing
the
print
of
a
man
's
foot
was
not
such
a
strange
thing
in
the
*NL*
island
as
I
imagined
:
and
but
that
it
was
a
special
providence
that
I
was
*NL*
cast
upon
the
side
of
the
island
where
the
savages
never
came
,
I
should
*NL*
easily
have
known
that
nothing
was
more
frequent
than
for
the
canoes
from
*NL*
the
main
,
when
they
happened
to
be
a
little
too
far
out
at
sea
,
to
shoot
*NL*
over
to
that
side
of
the
island
for
harbour
:
likewise
,
as
they
often
met
*NL*
and
fought
in
their
canoes
,
the
victors
,
having
taken
any
prisoners
,
*NL*
would
bring
them
over
to
this
shore
,
where
,
according
to
their
dreadful
*NL*
customs
,
being
all
cannibals
,
they
would
kill
and
eat
them
;
of
which
*NL*
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
come
down
the
hill
to
the
shore
,
as
I
said
above
,
being
the
*NL*
SW
.
point
of
the
island
,
I
was
perfectly
confounded
and
amazed
;
nor
is
it
*NL*
possible
for
me
to
express
the
horror
of
my
mind
at
seeing
the
shore
*NL*
spread
with
skulls
,
hands
,
feet
,
and
other
bones
of
human
bodies
;
and
*NL*
particularly
I
observed
a
place
where
there
had
been
a
fire
made
,
and
a
*NL*
circle
dug
in
the
earth
,
like
a
cockpit
,
where
I
supposed
the
savage
*NL*
wretches
had
sat
down
to
their
human
feastings
upon
the
bodies
of
their
*NL*
fellow-creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
astonished
with
the
sight
of
these
things
,
that
I
entertained
no
*NL*
notions
of
any
danger
to
myself
from
it
for
a
long
while
:
all
my
*NL*
apprehensions
were
buried
in
the
thoughts
of
such
a
pitch
of
inhuman
,
*NL*
hellish
brutality
,
and
the
horror
of
the
degeneracy
of
human
nature
,
*NL*
which
,
though
I
had
heard
of
it
often
,
yet
I
never
had
so
near
a
view
of
*NL*
before
;
in
short
,
I
turned
away
my
face
from
the
horrid
spectacle
;
my
*NL*
stomach
grew
sick
,
and
I
was
just
at
the
point
of
fainting
,
when
nature
*NL*
discharged
the
disorder
from
my
stomach
;
and
having
vomited
with
uncommon
*NL*
violence
,
I
was
a
little
relieved
,
but
could
not
bear
to
stay
in
the
*NL*
place
a
moment
;
so
I
got
up
the
hill
again
with
all
the
speed
I
could
,
*NL*
and
walked
on
towards
my
own
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
a
little
out
of
that
part
of
the
island
I
stood
still
awhile
,
*NL*
as
amazed
,
and
then
,
recovering
myself
,
I
looked
up
with
the
utmost
*NL*
affection
of
my
soul
,
and
,
with
a
flood
of
tears
in
my
eyes
,
gave
God
*NL*
thanks
,
that
had
cast
my
first
lot
in
a
part
of
the
world
where
I
was
*NL*
distinguished
from
such
dreadful
creatures
as
these
;
and
that
,
though
I
*NL*
had
esteemed
my
present
condition
very
miserable
,
had
yet
given
me
so
*NL*
many
comforts
in
it
that
I
had
still
more
to
give
thanks
for
than
to
*NL*
complain
of
:
and
this
,
above
all
,
that
I
had
,
even
in
this
miserable
*NL*
condition
,
been
comforted
with
the
knowledge
of
Himself
,
and
the
hope
of
*NL*
His
blessing
:
which
was
a
felicity
more
than
sufficiently
equivalent
to
*NL*
all
the
misery
which
I
had
suffered
,
or
could
suffer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
frame
of
thankfulness
I
went
home
to
my
castle
,
and
began
to
be
*NL*
much
easier
now
,
as
to
the
safety
of
my
circumstances
,
than
ever
I
was
*NL*
before
:
for
I
observed
that
these
wretches
never
came
to
this
island
in
*NL*
search
of
what
they
could
get
;
perhaps
not
seeking
,
not
wanting
,
or
not
*NL*
expecting
anything
here
;
and
having
often
,
no
doubt
,
been
up
the
covered
,
*NL*
woody
part
of
it
without
finding
anything
to
their
purpose
.
I
knew
I
had
*NL*
been
here
now
almost
eighteen
years
,
and
never
saw
the
least
footsteps
of
*NL*
human
creature
there
before
;
and
I
might
be
eighteen
years
more
as
*NL*
entirely
concealed
as
I
was
now
,
if
I
did
not
discover
myself
to
them
,
*NL*
which
I
had
no
manner
of
occasion
to
do
;
it
being
my
only
business
to
*NL*
keep
myself
entirely
concealed
where
I
was
,
unless
I
found
a
better
sort
*NL*
of
creatures
than
cannibals
to
make
myself
known
to
.
Yet
I
entertained
*NL*
such
an
abhorrence
of
the
savage
wretches
that
I
have
been
speaking
of
,
*NL*
and
of
the
wretched
,
inhuman
custom
of
their
devouring
and
eating
one
*NL*
another
up
,
that
I
continued
pensive
and
sad
,
and
kept
close
within
my
*NL*
own
circle
for
almost
two
years
after
this
:
when
I
say
my
own
circle
,
I
*NL*
mean
by
it
my
three
plantations
--
viz
.
my
castle
,
my
country
seat
-LRB-
which
I
*NL*
called
my
bower
-RRB-
,
and
my
enclosure
in
the
woods
:
nor
did
I
look
after
*NL*
this
for
any
other
use
than
an
enclosure
for
my
goats
;
for
the
aversion
*NL*
which
nature
gave
me
to
these
hellish
wretches
was
such
,
that
I
was
as
*NL*
fearful
of
seeing
them
as
of
seeing
the
devil
himself
.
I
did
not
so
much
*NL*
as
go
to
look
after
my
boat
all
this
time
,
but
began
rather
to
think
of
*NL*
making
another
;
for
I
could
not
think
of
ever
making
any
more
attempts
to
*NL*
bring
the
other
boat
round
the
island
to
me
,
lest
I
should
meet
with
some
*NL*
of
these
creatures
at
sea
;
in
which
case
,
if
I
had
happened
to
have
*NL*
fallen
into
their
hands
,
I
knew
what
would
have
been
my
lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
,
however
,
and
the
satisfaction
I
had
that
I
was
in
no
danger
of
*NL*
being
discovered
by
these
people
,
began
to
wear
off
my
uneasiness
about
*NL*
them
;
and
I
began
to
live
just
in
the
same
composed
manner
as
before
,
*NL*
only
with
this
difference
,
that
I
used
more
caution
,
and
kept
my
eyes
*NL*
more
about
me
than
I
did
before
,
lest
I
should
happen
to
be
seen
by
any
*NL*
of
them
;
and
particularly
,
I
was
more
cautious
of
firing
my
gun
,
lest
any
*NL*
of
them
,
being
on
the
island
,
should
happen
to
hear
it
.
It
was
,
*NL*
therefore
,
a
very
good
providence
to
me
that
I
had
furnished
myself
with
*NL*
a
tame
breed
of
goats
,
and
that
I
had
no
need
to
hunt
any
more
about
the
*NL*
woods
,
or
shoot
at
them
;
and
if
I
did
catch
any
of
them
after
this
,
it
*NL*
was
by
traps
and
snares
,
as
I
had
done
before
;
so
that
for
two
years
*NL*
after
this
I
believe
I
never
fired
my
gun
once
off
,
though
I
never
went
*NL*
out
without
it
;
and
what
was
more
,
as
I
had
saved
three
pistols
out
of
*NL*
the
ship
,
I
always
carried
them
out
with
me
,
or
at
least
two
of
them
,
*NL*
sticking
them
in
my
goat-skin
belt
.
I
also
furbished
up
one
of
the
great
*NL*
cutlasses
that
I
had
out
of
the
ship
,
and
made
me
a
belt
to
hang
it
on
*NL*
also
;
so
that
I
was
now
a
most
formidable
fellow
to
look
at
when
I
went
*NL*
abroad
,
if
you
add
to
the
former
description
of
myself
the
particular
of
*NL*
two
pistols
,
and
a
broadsword
hanging
at
my
side
in
a
belt
,
but
without
a
*NL*
scabbard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
going
on
thus
,
as
I
have
said
,
for
some
time
,
I
seemed
,
excepting
*NL*
these
cautions
,
to
be
reduced
to
my
former
calm
,
sedate
way
of
living
.
*NL*
All
these
things
tended
to
show
me
more
and
more
how
far
my
condition
was
*NL*
from
being
miserable
,
compared
to
some
others
;
nay
,
to
many
other
*NL*
particulars
of
life
which
it
might
have
pleased
God
to
have
made
my
lot
.
*NL*
It
put
me
upon
reflecting
how
little
repining
there
would
be
among
*NL*
mankind
at
any
condition
of
life
if
people
would
rather
compare
their
*NL*
condition
with
those
that
were
worse
,
in
order
to
be
thankful
,
than
be
*NL*
always
comparing
them
with
those
which
are
better
,
to
assist
their
*NL*
murmurings
and
complainings
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
in
my
present
condition
there
were
not
really
many
things
which
I
*NL*
wanted
,
so
indeed
I
thought
that
the
frights
I
had
been
in
about
these
*NL*
savage
wretches
,
and
the
concern
I
had
been
in
for
my
own
preservation
,
*NL*
had
taken
off
the
edge
of
my
invention
,
for
my
own
conveniences
;
and
I
*NL*
had
dropped
a
good
design
,
which
I
had
once
bent
my
thoughts
upon
,
and
*NL*
that
was
to
try
if
I
could
not
make
some
of
my
barley
into
malt
,
and
then
*NL*
try
to
brew
myself
some
beer
.
This
was
really
a
whimsical
thought
,
and
I
*NL*
reproved
myself
often
for
the
simplicity
of
it
:
for
I
presently
saw
there
*NL*
would
be
the
want
of
several
things
necessary
to
the
making
my
beer
that
*NL*
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
supply
;
as
,
first
,
casks
to
preserve
it
*NL*
in
,
which
was
a
thing
that
,
as
I
have
observed
already
,
I
could
never
*NL*
compass
:
no
,
though
I
spent
not
only
many
days
,
but
weeks
,
nay
months
,
in
*NL*
attempting
it
,
but
to
no
purpose
.
In
the
next
place
,
I
had
no
hops
to
*NL*
make
it
keep
,
no
yeast
to
make
it
work
,
no
copper
or
kettle
to
make
it
*NL*
boil
;
and
yet
with
all
these
things
wanting
,
I
verily
believe
,
had
not
*NL*
the
frights
and
terrors
I
was
in
about
the
savages
intervened
,
I
had
*NL*
undertaken
it
,
and
perhaps
brought
it
to
pass
too
;
for
I
seldom
gave
*NL*
anything
over
without
accomplishing
it
,
when
once
I
had
it
in
my
head
to
*NL*
began
it
.
But
my
invention
now
ran
quite
another
way
;
for
night
and
day
*NL*
I
could
think
of
nothing
but
how
I
might
destroy
some
of
the
monsters
in
*NL*
their
cruel
,
bloody
entertainment
,
and
if
possible
save
the
victim
they
*NL*
should
bring
hither
to
destroy
.
It
would
take
up
a
larger
volume
than
*NL*
this
whole
work
is
intended
to
be
to
set
down
all
the
contrivances
I
*NL*
hatched
,
or
rather
brooded
upon
,
in
my
thoughts
,
for
the
destroying
these
*NL*
creatures
,
or
at
least
frightening
them
so
as
to
prevent
their
coming
*NL*
hither
any
more
:
but
all
this
was
abortive
;
nothing
could
be
possible
to
*NL*
take
effect
,
unless
I
was
to
be
there
to
do
it
myself
:
and
what
could
one
*NL*
man
do
among
them
,
when
perhaps
there
might
be
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
*NL*
together
with
their
darts
,
or
their
bows
and
arrows
,
with
which
they
*NL*
could
shoot
as
true
to
a
mark
as
I
could
with
my
gun
?
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
I
thought
if
digging
a
hole
under
the
place
where
they
made
*NL*
their
fire
,
and
putting
in
five
or
six
pounds
of
gunpowder
,
which
,
when
*NL*
they
kindled
their
fire
,
would
consequently
take
fire
,
and
blow
up
all
*NL*
that
was
near
it
:
but
as
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
should
be
unwilling
to
*NL*
waste
so
much
powder
upon
them
,
my
store
being
now
within
the
quantity
of
*NL*
one
barrel
,
so
neither
could
I
be
sure
of
its
going
off
at
any
certain
*NL*
time
,
when
it
might
surprise
them
;
and
,
at
best
,
that
it
would
do
little
*NL*
more
than
just
blow
the
fire
about
their
ears
and
fright
them
,
but
not
*NL*
sufficient
to
make
them
forsake
the
place
:
so
I
laid
it
aside
;
and
then
*NL*
proposed
that
I
would
place
myself
in
ambush
in
some
convenient
place
,
*NL*
with
my
three
guns
all
double-loaded
,
and
in
the
middle
of
their
bloody
*NL*
ceremony
let
fly
at
them
,
when
I
should
be
sure
to
kill
or
wound
perhaps
*NL*
two
or
three
at
every
shot
;
and
then
falling
in
upon
them
with
my
three
*NL*
pistols
and
my
sword
,
I
made
no
doubt
but
that
,
if
there
were
twenty
,
I
*NL*
should
kill
them
all
.
This
fancy
pleased
my
thoughts
for
some
weeks
,
and
*NL*
I
was
so
full
of
it
that
I
often
dreamed
of
it
,
and
,
sometimes
,
that
I
*NL*
was
just
going
to
let
fly
at
them
in
my
sleep
.
I
went
so
far
with
it
in
*NL*
my
imagination
that
I
employed
myself
several
days
to
find
out
proper
*NL*
places
to
put
myself
in
ambuscade
,
as
I
said
,
to
watch
for
them
,
and
I
*NL*
went
frequently
to
the
place
itself
,
which
was
now
grown
more
familiar
to
*NL*
me
;
but
while
my
mind
was
thus
filled
with
thoughts
of
revenge
and
a
*NL*
bloody
putting
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
to
the
sword
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
*NL*
the
horror
I
had
at
the
place
,
and
at
the
signals
of
the
barbarous
*NL*
wretches
devouring
one
another
,
abetted
my
malice
.
Well
,
at
length
I
*NL*
found
a
place
in
the
side
of
the
hill
where
I
was
satisfied
I
might
*NL*
securely
wait
till
I
saw
any
of
their
boats
coming
;
and
might
then
,
even
*NL*
before
they
would
be
ready
to
come
on
shore
,
convey
myself
unseen
into
*NL*
some
thickets
of
trees
,
in
one
of
which
there
was
a
hollow
large
enough
*NL*
to
conceal
me
entirely
;
and
there
I
might
sit
and
observe
all
their
*NL*
bloody
doings
,
and
take
my
full
aim
at
their
heads
,
when
they
were
so
*NL*
close
together
as
that
it
would
be
next
to
impossible
that
I
should
miss
*NL*
my
shot
,
or
that
I
could
fail
wounding
three
or
four
of
them
at
the
first
*NL*
shot
.
In
this
place
,
then
,
I
resolved
to
fulfil
my
design
;
and
*NL*
accordingly
I
prepared
two
muskets
and
my
ordinary
fowling-piece
.
The
*NL*
two
muskets
I
loaded
with
a
brace
of
slugs
each
,
and
four
or
five
smaller
*NL*
bullets
,
about
the
size
of
pistol
bullets
;
and
the
fowling-piece
I
loaded
*NL*
with
near
a
handful
of
swan-shot
of
the
largest
size
;
I
also
loaded
my
*NL*
pistols
with
about
four
bullets
each
;
and
,
in
this
posture
,
well
provided
*NL*
with
ammunition
for
a
second
and
third
charge
,
I
prepared
myself
for
my
*NL*
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
thus
laid
the
scheme
of
my
design
,
and
in
my
imagination
put
*NL*
it
in
practice
,
I
continually
made
my
tour
every
morning
to
the
top
of
*NL*
the
hill
,
which
was
from
my
castle
,
as
I
called
it
,
about
three
miles
or
*NL*
more
,
to
see
if
I
could
observe
any
boats
upon
the
sea
,
coming
near
the
*NL*
island
,
or
standing
over
towards
it
;
but
I
began
to
tire
of
this
hard
*NL*
duty
,
after
I
had
for
two
or
three
months
constantly
kept
my
watch
,
but
*NL*
came
always
back
without
any
discovery
;
there
having
not
,
in
all
that
*NL*
time
,
been
the
least
appearance
,
not
only
on
or
near
the
shore
,
but
on
*NL*
the
whole
ocean
,
so
far
as
my
eye
or
glass
could
reach
every
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
I
kept
my
daily
tour
to
the
hill
,
to
look
out
,
so
long
also
I
*NL*
kept
up
the
vigour
of
my
design
,
and
my
spirits
seemed
to
be
all
the
*NL*
while
in
a
suitable
frame
for
so
outrageous
an
execution
as
the
killing
*NL*
twenty
or
thirty
naked
savages
,
for
an
offence
which
I
had
not
at
all
*NL*
entered
into
any
discussion
of
in
my
thoughts
,
any
farther
than
my
*NL*
passions
were
at
first
fired
by
the
horror
I
conceived
at
the
unnatural
*NL*
custom
of
the
people
of
that
country
,
who
,
it
seems
,
had
been
suffered
by
*NL*
Providence
,
in
His
wise
disposition
of
the
world
,
to
have
no
other
guide
*NL*
than
that
of
their
own
abominable
and
vitiated
passions
;
and
consequently
*NL*
were
left
,
and
perhaps
had
been
so
for
some
ages
,
to
act
such
horrid
*NL*
things
,
and
receive
such
dreadful
customs
,
as
nothing
but
nature
,
*NL*
entirely
abandoned
by
Heaven
,
and
actuated
by
some
hellish
degeneracy
,
*NL*
could
have
run
them
into
.
But
now
,
when
,
as
I
have
said
,
I
began
to
be
*NL*
weary
of
the
fruitless
excursion
which
I
had
made
so
long
and
so
far
*NL*
every
morning
in
vain
,
so
my
opinion
of
the
action
itself
began
to
alter
;
*NL*
and
I
began
,
with
cooler
and
calmer
thoughts
,
to
consider
what
I
was
*NL*
going
to
engage
in
;
what
authority
or
call
I
had
to
pretend
to
be
judge
*NL*
and
executioner
upon
these
men
as
criminals
,
whom
Heaven
had
thought
fit
*NL*
for
so
many
ages
to
suffer
unpunished
to
go
on
,
and
to
be
as
it
were
the
*NL*
executioners
of
His
judgments
one
upon
another
;
how
far
these
people
were
*NL*
offenders
against
me
,
and
what
right
I
had
to
engage
in
the
quarrel
of
*NL*
that
blood
which
they
shed
promiscuously
upon
one
another
.
I
debated
*NL*
this
very
often
with
myself
thus
:
``
How
do
I
know
what
God
Himself
judges
*NL*
in
this
particular
case
?
It
is
certain
these
people
do
not
commit
this
*NL*
as
a
crime
;
it
is
not
against
their
own
consciences
reproving
,
or
their
*NL*
light
reproaching
them
;
they
do
not
know
it
to
be
an
offence
,
and
then
*NL*
commit
it
in
defiance
of
divine
justice
,
as
we
do
in
almost
all
the
sins
*NL*
we
commit
.
They
think
it
no
more
a
crime
to
kill
a
captive
taken
in
war
*NL*
than
we
do
to
kill
an
ox
;
or
to
eat
human
flesh
than
we
do
to
eat
*NL*
mutton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
considered
this
a
little
,
it
followed
necessarily
that
I
was
*NL*
certainly
in
the
wrong
;
that
these
people
were
not
murderers
,
in
the
*NL*
sense
that
I
had
before
condemned
them
in
my
thoughts
,
any
more
than
*NL*
those
Christians
were
murderers
who
often
put
to
death
the
prisoners
*NL*
taken
in
battle
;
or
more
frequently
,
upon
many
occasions
,
put
whole
*NL*
troops
of
men
to
the
sword
,
without
giving
quarter
,
though
they
threw
*NL*
down
their
arms
and
submitted
.
In
the
next
place
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
*NL*
although
the
usage
they
gave
one
another
was
thus
brutish
and
inhuman
,
*NL*
yet
it
was
really
nothing
to
me
:
these
people
had
done
me
no
injury
:
that
*NL*
if
they
attempted
,
or
I
saw
it
necessary
,
for
my
immediate
preservation
,
*NL*
to
fall
upon
them
,
something
might
be
said
for
it
:
but
that
I
was
yet
out
*NL*
of
their
power
,
and
they
really
had
no
knowledge
of
me
,
and
consequently
*NL*
no
design
upon
me
;
and
therefore
it
could
not
be
just
for
me
to
fall
upon
*NL*
them
;
that
this
would
justify
the
conduct
of
the
Spaniards
in
all
their
*NL*
barbarities
practised
in
America
,
where
they
destroyed
millions
of
these
*NL*
people
;
who
,
however
they
were
idolators
and
barbarians
,
and
had
several
*NL*
bloody
and
barbarous
rites
in
their
customs
,
such
as
sacrificing
human
*NL*
bodies
to
their
idols
,
were
yet
,
as
to
the
Spaniards
,
very
innocent
*NL*
people
;
and
that
the
rooting
them
out
of
the
country
is
spoken
of
with
*NL*
the
utmost
abhorrence
and
detestation
by
even
the
Spaniards
themselves
at
*NL*
this
time
,
and
by
all
other
Christian
nations
of
Europe
,
as
a
mere
*NL*
butchery
,
a
bloody
and
unnatural
piece
of
cruelty
,
unjustifiable
either
*NL*
to
God
or
man
;
and
for
which
the
very
name
of
a
Spaniard
is
reckoned
to
*NL*
be
frightful
and
terrible
,
to
all
people
of
humanity
or
of
Christian
*NL*
compassion
;
as
if
the
kingdom
of
Spain
were
particularly
eminent
for
the
*NL*
produce
of
a
race
of
men
who
were
without
principles
of
tenderness
,
or
*NL*
the
common
bowels
of
pity
to
the
miserable
,
which
is
reckoned
to
be
a
*NL*
mark
of
generous
temper
in
the
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
considerations
really
put
me
to
a
pause
,
and
to
a
kind
of
a
full
*NL*
stop
;
and
I
began
by
little
and
little
to
be
off
my
design
,
and
to
*NL*
conclude
I
had
taken
wrong
measures
in
my
resolution
to
attack
the
*NL*
savages
;
and
that
it
was
not
my
business
to
meddle
with
them
,
unless
they
*NL*
first
attacked
me
;
and
this
it
was
my
business
,
if
possible
,
to
prevent
:
*NL*
but
that
,
if
I
were
discovered
and
attacked
by
them
,
I
knew
my
duty
.
On
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
I
argued
with
myself
that
this
really
was
the
way
not
to
*NL*
deliver
myself
,
but
entirely
to
ruin
and
destroy
myself
;
for
unless
I
was
*NL*
sure
to
kill
every
one
that
not
only
should
be
on
shore
at
that
time
,
but
*NL*
that
should
ever
come
on
shore
afterwards
,
if
but
one
of
them
escaped
to
*NL*
tell
their
country-people
what
had
happened
,
they
would
come
over
again
*NL*
by
thousands
to
revenge
the
death
of
their
fellows
,
and
I
should
only
*NL*
bring
upon
myself
a
certain
destruction
,
which
,
at
present
,
I
had
no
*NL*
manner
of
occasion
for
.
Upon
the
whole
,
I
concluded
that
I
ought
,
*NL*
neither
in
principle
nor
in
policy
,
one
way
or
other
,
to
concern
myself
*NL*
in
this
affair
:
that
my
business
was
,
by
all
possible
means
to
conceal
*NL*
myself
from
them
,
and
not
to
leave
the
least
sign
for
them
to
guess
by
*NL*
that
there
were
any
living
creatures
upon
the
island
--
I
mean
of
human
*NL*
shape
.
Religion
joined
in
with
this
prudential
resolution
;
and
I
was
*NL*
convinced
now
,
many
ways
,
that
I
was
perfectly
out
of
my
duty
when
I
was
*NL*
laying
all
my
bloody
schemes
for
the
destruction
of
innocent
creatures
--
I
*NL*
mean
innocent
as
to
me
.
As
to
the
crimes
they
were
guilty
of
towards
one
*NL*
another
,
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
;
they
were
national
,
and
I
ought
*NL*
to
leave
them
to
the
justice
of
God
,
who
is
the
Governor
of
nations
,
and
*NL*
knows
how
,
by
national
punishments
,
to
make
a
just
retribution
for
*NL*
national
offences
,
and
to
bring
public
judgments
upon
those
who
offend
in
*NL*
a
public
manner
,
by
such
ways
as
best
please
Him
.
This
appeared
so
clear
*NL*
to
me
now
,
that
nothing
was
a
greater
satisfaction
to
me
than
that
I
had
*NL*
not
been
suffered
to
do
a
thing
which
I
now
saw
so
much
reason
to
believe
*NL*
would
have
been
no
less
a
sin
than
that
of
wilful
murder
if
I
had
*NL*
committed
it
;
and
I
gave
most
humble
thanks
on
my
knees
to
God
,
that
He
*NL*
had
thus
delivered
me
from
blood-guiltiness
;
beseeching
Him
to
grant
me
*NL*
the
protection
of
His
providence
,
that
I
might
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
*NL*
the
barbarians
,
or
that
I
might
not
lay
my
hands
upon
them
,
unless
I
had
*NL*
a
more
clear
call
from
Heaven
to
do
it
,
in
defence
of
my
own
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
disposition
I
continued
for
near
a
year
after
this
;
and
so
far
*NL*
was
I
from
desiring
an
occasion
for
falling
upon
these
wretches
,
that
in
*NL*
all
that
time
I
never
once
went
up
the
hill
to
see
whether
there
were
any
*NL*
of
them
in
sight
,
or
to
know
whether
any
of
them
had
been
on
shore
there
*NL*
or
not
,
that
I
might
not
be
tempted
to
renew
any
of
my
contrivances
*NL*
against
them
,
or
be
provoked
by
any
advantage
that
might
present
itself
*NL*
to
fall
upon
them
;
only
this
I
did
:
I
went
and
removed
my
boat
,
which
I
*NL*
had
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
and
carried
it
down
to
the
east
end
*NL*
of
the
whole
island
,
where
I
ran
it
into
a
little
cove
,
which
I
found
*NL*
under
some
high
rocks
,
and
where
I
knew
,
by
reason
of
the
currents
,
the
*NL*
savages
durst
not
,
at
least
would
not
,
come
with
their
boats
upon
any
*NL*
account
whatever
.
With
my
boat
I
carried
away
everything
that
I
had
left
*NL*
there
belonging
to
her
,
though
not
necessary
for
the
bare
going
*NL*
thither
--
viz
.
a
mast
and
sail
which
I
had
made
for
her
,
and
a
thing
like
*NL*
an
anchor
,
but
which
,
indeed
,
could
not
be
called
either
anchor
or
*NL*
grapnel
;
however
,
it
was
the
best
I
could
make
of
its
kind
:
all
these
I
*NL*
removed
,
that
there
might
not
be
the
least
shadow
for
discovery
,
or
*NL*
appearance
of
any
boat
,
or
of
any
human
habitation
upon
the
island
.
*NL*
Besides
this
,
I
kept
myself
,
as
I
said
,
more
retired
than
ever
,
and
*NL*
seldom
went
from
my
cell
except
upon
my
constant
employment
,
to
milk
my
*NL*
she-goats
,
and
manage
my
little
flock
in
the
wood
,
which
,
as
it
was
quite
*NL*
on
the
other
part
of
the
island
,
was
out
of
danger
;
for
certain
,
it
is
*NL*
that
these
savage
people
,
who
sometimes
haunted
this
island
,
never
came
*NL*
with
any
thoughts
of
finding
anything
here
,
and
consequently
never
*NL*
wandered
off
from
the
coast
,
and
I
doubt
not
but
they
might
have
been
*NL*
several
times
on
shore
after
my
apprehensions
of
them
had
made
me
*NL*
cautious
,
as
well
as
before
.
Indeed
,
I
looked
back
with
some
horror
upon
*NL*
the
thoughts
of
what
my
condition
would
have
been
if
I
had
chopped
upon
*NL*
them
and
been
discovered
before
that
;
when
,
naked
and
unarmed
,
except
*NL*
with
one
gun
,
and
that
loaded
often
only
with
small
shot
,
I
walked
*NL*
everywhere
,
peeping
and
peering
about
the
island
,
to
see
what
I
could
*NL*
get
;
what
a
surprise
should
I
have
been
in
if
,
when
I
discovered
the
*NL*
print
of
a
man
's
foot
,
I
had
,
instead
of
that
,
seen
fifteen
or
twenty
*NL*
savages
,
and
found
them
pursuing
me
,
and
by
the
swiftness
of
their
*NL*
running
no
possibility
of
my
escaping
them
!
The
thoughts
of
this
*NL*
sometimes
sank
my
very
soul
within
me
,
and
distressed
my
mind
so
much
*NL*
that
I
could
not
soon
recover
it
,
to
think
what
I
should
have
done
,
and
*NL*
how
I
should
not
only
have
been
unable
to
resist
them
,
but
even
should
*NL*
not
have
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
do
what
I
might
have
done
;
much
*NL*
less
what
now
,
after
so
much
consideration
and
preparation
,
I
might
be
*NL*
able
to
do
.
Indeed
,
after
serious
thinking
of
these
things
,
I
would
be
*NL*
melancholy
,
and
sometimes
it
would
last
a
great
while
;
but
I
resolved
it
*NL*
all
at
last
into
thankfulness
to
that
Providence
which
had
delivered
me
*NL*
from
so
many
unseen
dangers
,
and
had
kept
me
from
those
mischiefs
which
I
*NL*
could
have
no
way
been
the
agent
in
delivering
myself
from
,
because
I
had
*NL*
not
the
least
notion
of
any
such
thing
depending
,
or
the
least
*NL*
supposition
of
its
being
possible
.
This
renewed
a
contemplation
which
*NL*
often
had
come
into
my
thoughts
in
former
times
,
when
first
I
began
to
*NL*
see
the
merciful
dispositions
of
Heaven
,
in
the
dangers
we
run
through
in
*NL*
this
life
;
how
wonderfully
we
are
delivered
when
we
know
nothing
of
it
;
*NL*
how
,
when
we
are
in
a
quandary
as
we
call
it
,
a
doubt
or
hesitation
*NL*
whether
to
go
this
way
or
that
way
,
a
secret
hint
shall
direct
us
this
*NL*
way
,
when
we
intended
to
go
that
way
:
nay
,
when
sense
,
our
own
*NL*
inclination
,
and
perhaps
business
has
called
us
to
go
the
other
way
,
yet
*NL*
a
strange
impression
upon
the
mind
,
from
we
know
not
what
springs
,
and
by
*NL*
we
know
not
what
power
,
shall
overrule
us
to
go
this
way
;
and
it
shall
*NL*
afterwards
appear
that
had
we
gone
that
way
,
which
we
should
have
gone
,
*NL*
and
even
to
our
imagination
ought
to
have
gone
,
we
should
have
been
*NL*
ruined
and
lost
.
Upon
these
and
many
like
reflections
I
afterwards
made
*NL*
it
a
certain
rule
with
me
,
that
whenever
I
found
those
secret
hints
or
*NL*
pressings
of
mind
to
doing
or
not
doing
anything
that
presented
,
or
going
*NL*
this
way
or
that
way
,
I
never
failed
to
obey
the
secret
dictate
;
though
I
*NL*
knew
no
other
reason
for
it
than
such
a
pressure
or
such
a
hint
hung
upon
*NL*
my
mind
.
I
could
give
many
examples
of
the
success
of
this
conduct
in
*NL*
the
course
of
my
life
,
but
more
especially
in
the
latter
part
of
my
*NL*
inhabiting
this
unhappy
island
;
besides
many
occasions
which
it
is
very
*NL*
likely
I
might
have
taken
notice
of
,
if
I
had
seen
with
the
same
eyes
*NL*
then
that
I
see
with
now
.
But
it
is
never
too
late
to
be
wise
;
and
I
*NL*
can
not
but
advise
all
considering
men
,
whose
lives
are
attended
with
such
*NL*
extraordinary
incidents
as
mine
,
or
even
though
not
so
extraordinary
,
not
*NL*
to
slight
such
secret
intimations
of
Providence
,
let
them
come
from
what
*NL*
invisible
intelligence
they
will
.
That
I
shall
not
discuss
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
can
not
account
for
;
but
certainly
they
are
a
proof
of
the
converse
of
*NL*
spirits
,
and
a
secret
communication
between
those
embodied
and
those
*NL*
unembodied
,
and
such
a
proof
as
can
never
be
withstood
;
of
which
I
shall
*NL*
have
occasion
to
give
some
remarkable
instances
in
the
remainder
of
my
*NL*
solitary
residence
in
this
dismal
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
the
reader
of
this
will
not
think
it
strange
if
I
confess
that
*NL*
these
anxieties
,
these
constant
dangers
I
lived
in
,
and
the
concern
that
*NL*
was
now
upon
me
,
put
an
end
to
all
invention
,
and
to
all
the
contrivances
*NL*
that
I
had
laid
for
my
future
accommodations
and
conveniences
.
I
had
the
*NL*
care
of
my
safety
more
now
upon
my
hands
than
that
of
my
food
.
I
cared
*NL*
not
to
drive
a
nail
,
or
chop
a
stick
of
wood
now
,
for
fear
the
noise
I
*NL*
might
make
should
be
heard
:
much
less
would
I
fire
a
gun
for
the
same
*NL*
reason
:
and
above
all
I
was
intolerably
uneasy
at
making
any
fire
,
lest
*NL*
the
smoke
,
which
is
visible
at
a
great
distance
in
the
day
,
should
betray
*NL*
me
.
For
this
reason
,
I
removed
that
part
of
my
business
which
required
*NL*
fire
,
such
as
burning
of
pots
and
pipes
,
&
c.
,
into
my
new
apartment
in
*NL*
the
woods
;
where
,
after
I
had
been
some
time
,
I
found
,
to
my
unspeakable
*NL*
consolation
,
a
mere
natural
cave
in
the
earth
,
which
went
in
a
vast
way
,
*NL*
and
where
,
I
daresay
,
no
savage
,
had
he
been
at
the
mouth
of
it
,
would
be
*NL*
so
hardy
as
to
venture
in
;
nor
,
indeed
,
would
any
man
else
,
but
one
who
,
*NL*
like
me
,
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
a
safe
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mouth
of
this
hollow
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
great
rock
,
where
,
by
*NL*
mere
accident
-LRB-
I
would
say
,
if
I
did
not
see
abundant
reason
to
ascribe
*NL*
all
such
things
now
to
Providence
-RRB-
,
I
was
cutting
down
some
thick
*NL*
branches
of
trees
to
make
charcoal
;
and
before
I
go
on
I
must
observe
the
*NL*
reason
of
my
making
this
charcoal
,
which
was
this
--
I
was
afraid
of
making
*NL*
a
smoke
about
my
habitation
,
as
I
said
before
;
and
yet
I
could
not
live
*NL*
there
without
baking
my
bread
,
cooking
my
meat
,
&
c.
;
so
I
contrived
to
*NL*
burn
some
wood
here
,
as
I
had
seen
done
in
England
,
under
turf
,
till
it
*NL*
became
chark
or
dry
coal
:
and
then
putting
the
fire
out
,
I
preserved
the
*NL*
coal
to
carry
home
,
and
perform
the
other
services
for
which
fire
was
*NL*
wanting
,
without
danger
of
smoke
.
But
this
is
by-the-bye
.
While
I
was
*NL*
cutting
down
some
wood
here
,
I
perceived
that
,
behind
a
very
thick
branch
*NL*
of
low
brushwood
or
underwood
,
there
was
a
kind
of
hollow
place
:
I
was
*NL*
curious
to
look
in
it
;
and
getting
with
difficulty
into
the
mouth
of
it
,
*NL*
I
found
it
was
pretty
large
,
that
is
to
say
,
sufficient
for
me
to
stand
*NL*
upright
in
it
,
and
perhaps
another
with
me
:
but
I
must
confess
to
you
*NL*
that
I
made
more
haste
out
than
I
did
in
,
when
looking
farther
into
the
*NL*
place
,
and
which
was
perfectly
dark
,
I
saw
two
broad
shining
eyes
of
some
*NL*
creature
,
whether
devil
or
man
I
knew
not
,
which
twinkled
like
two
stars
;
*NL*
the
dim
light
from
the
cave
's
mouth
shining
directly
in
,
and
making
the
*NL*
reflection
.
However
,
after
some
pause
I
recovered
myself
,
and
began
to
*NL*
call
myself
a
thousand
fools
,
and
to
think
that
he
that
was
afraid
to
see
*NL*
the
devil
was
not
fit
to
live
twenty
years
in
an
island
all
alone
;
and
*NL*
that
I
might
well
think
there
was
nothing
in
this
cave
that
was
more
*NL*
frightful
than
myself
.
Upon
this
,
plucking
up
my
courage
,
I
took
up
a
*NL*
firebrand
,
and
in
I
rushed
again
,
with
the
stick
flaming
in
my
hand
:
I
*NL*
had
not
gone
three
steps
in
before
I
was
almost
as
frightened
as
before
;
*NL*
for
I
heard
a
very
loud
sigh
,
like
that
of
a
man
in
some
pain
,
and
it
was
*NL*
followed
by
a
broken
noise
,
as
of
words
half
expressed
,
and
then
a
deep
*NL*
sigh
again
.
I
stepped
back
,
and
was
indeed
struck
with
such
a
surprise
*NL*
that
it
put
me
into
a
cold
sweat
,
and
if
I
had
had
a
hat
on
my
head
,
I
*NL*
will
not
answer
for
it
that
my
hair
might
not
have
lifted
it
off
.
But
*NL*
still
plucking
up
my
spirits
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
encouraging
myself
a
*NL*
little
with
considering
that
the
power
and
presence
of
God
was
*NL*
everywhere
,
and
was
able
to
protect
me
,
I
stepped
forward
again
,
and
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
firebrand
,
holding
it
up
a
little
over
my
head
,
I
saw
*NL*
lying
on
the
ground
a
monstrous
,
frightful
old
he-goat
,
just
making
his
*NL*
will
,
as
we
say
,
and
gasping
for
life
,
and
,
dying
,
indeed
,
of
mere
old
*NL*
age
.
I
stirred
him
a
little
to
see
if
I
could
get
him
out
,
and
he
*NL*
essayed
to
get
up
,
but
was
not
able
to
raise
himself
;
and
I
thought
with
*NL*
myself
he
might
even
lie
there
--
for
if
he
had
frightened
me
,
so
he
would
*NL*
certainly
fright
any
of
the
savages
,
if
any
of
them
should
be
so
hardy
as
*NL*
to
come
in
there
while
he
had
any
life
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
recovered
from
my
surprise
,
and
began
to
look
round
me
,
when
I
*NL*
found
the
cave
was
but
very
small
--
that
is
to
say
,
it
might
be
about
*NL*
twelve
feet
over
,
but
in
no
manner
of
shape
,
neither
round
nor
square
,
no
*NL*
hands
having
ever
been
employed
in
making
it
but
those
of
mere
Nature
.
I
*NL*
observed
also
that
there
was
a
place
at
the
farther
side
of
it
that
went
*NL*
in
further
,
but
was
so
low
that
it
required
me
to
creep
upon
my
hands
and
*NL*
knees
to
go
into
it
,
and
whither
it
went
I
knew
not
;
so
,
having
no
*NL*
candle
,
I
gave
it
over
for
that
time
,
but
resolved
to
go
again
the
next
*NL*
day
provided
with
candles
and
a
tinder-box
,
which
I
had
made
of
the
lock
*NL*
of
one
of
the
muskets
,
with
some
wildfire
in
the
pan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
the
next
day
I
came
provided
with
six
large
candles
of
my
*NL*
own
making
-LRB-
for
I
made
very
good
candles
now
of
goat
's
tallow
,
but
was
*NL*
hard
set
for
candle-wick
,
using
sometimes
rags
or
rope-yarn
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
the
dried
rind
of
a
weed
like
nettles
-RRB-
;
and
going
into
this
low
*NL*
place
I
was
obliged
to
creep
upon
all-fours
as
I
have
said
,
almost
ten
*NL*
yards
--
which
,
by
the
way
,
I
thought
was
a
venture
bold
enough
,
*NL*
considering
that
I
knew
not
how
far
it
might
go
,
nor
what
was
beyond
it
.
*NL*
When
I
had
got
through
the
strait
,
I
found
the
roof
rose
higher
up
,
I
*NL*
believe
near
twenty
feet
;
but
never
was
such
a
glorious
sight
seen
in
the
*NL*
island
,
I
daresay
,
as
it
was
to
look
round
the
sides
and
roof
of
this
*NL*
vault
or
cave
--
the
wall
reflected
a
hundred
thousand
lights
to
me
from
my
*NL*
two
candles
.
What
it
was
in
the
rock
--
whether
diamonds
or
any
other
*NL*
precious
stones
,
or
gold
which
I
rather
supposed
it
to
be
--
I
knew
not
.
*NL*
The
place
I
was
in
was
a
most
delightful
cavity
,
or
grotto
,
though
*NL*
perfectly
dark
;
the
floor
was
dry
and
level
,
and
had
a
sort
of
a
small
*NL*
loose
gravel
upon
it
,
so
that
there
was
no
nauseous
or
venomous
creature
*NL*
to
be
seen
,
neither
was
there
any
damp
or
wet
on
the
sides
or
roof
.
The
*NL*
only
difficulty
in
it
was
the
entrance
--
which
,
however
,
as
it
was
a
place
*NL*
of
security
,
and
such
a
retreat
as
I
wanted
;
I
thought
was
a
convenience
;
*NL*
so
that
I
was
really
rejoiced
at
the
discovery
,
and
resolved
,
without
any
*NL*
delay
,
to
bring
some
of
those
things
which
I
was
most
anxious
about
to
*NL*
this
place
:
particularly
,
I
resolved
to
bring
hither
my
magazine
of
*NL*
powder
,
and
all
my
spare
arms
--
viz
.
two
fowling-pieces
--
for
I
had
three
*NL*
in
all
--
and
three
muskets
--
for
of
them
I
had
eight
in
all
;
so
I
kept
in
*NL*
my
castle
only
five
,
which
stood
ready
mounted
like
pieces
of
cannon
on
*NL*
my
outmost
fence
,
and
were
ready
also
to
take
out
upon
any
expedition
.
*NL*
Upon
this
occasion
of
removing
my
ammunition
I
happened
to
open
the
*NL*
barrel
of
powder
which
I
took
up
out
of
the
sea
,
and
which
had
been
wet
,
*NL*
and
I
found
that
the
water
had
penetrated
about
three
or
four
inches
into
*NL*
the
powder
on
every
side
,
which
caking
and
growing
hard
,
had
preserved
*NL*
the
inside
like
a
kernel
in
the
shell
,
so
that
I
had
near
sixty
pounds
of
*NL*
very
good
powder
in
the
centre
of
the
cask
.
This
was
a
very
agreeable
*NL*
discovery
to
me
at
that
time
;
so
I
carried
all
away
thither
,
never
*NL*
keeping
above
two
or
three
pounds
of
powder
with
me
in
my
castle
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
a
surprise
of
any
kind
;
I
also
carried
thither
all
the
lead
I
had
*NL*
left
for
bullets
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
fancied
myself
now
like
one
of
the
ancient
giants
who
were
said
to
live
*NL*
in
caves
and
holes
in
the
rocks
,
where
none
could
come
at
them
;
for
I
*NL*
persuaded
myself
,
while
I
was
here
,
that
if
five
hundred
savages
were
to
*NL*
hunt
me
,
they
could
never
find
me
out
--
or
if
they
did
,
they
would
not
*NL*
venture
to
attack
me
here
.
The
old
goat
whom
I
found
expiring
died
in
*NL*
the
mouth
of
the
cave
the
next
day
after
I
made
this
discovery
;
and
I
*NL*
found
it
much
easier
to
dig
a
great
hole
there
,
and
throw
him
in
and
*NL*
cover
him
with
earth
,
than
to
drag
him
out
;
so
I
interred
him
there
,
to
*NL*
prevent
offence
to
my
nose
.

CHAPTER
XIII
--
WRECK
OF
A
SPANISH
SHIP
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
in
the
twenty-third
year
of
my
residence
in
this
island
,
and
*NL*
was
so
naturalised
to
the
place
and
the
manner
of
living
,
that
,
could
I
*NL*
but
have
enjoyed
the
certainty
that
no
savages
would
come
to
the
place
to
*NL*
disturb
me
,
I
could
have
been
content
to
have
capitulated
for
spending
*NL*
the
rest
of
my
time
there
,
even
to
the
last
moment
,
till
I
had
laid
me
*NL*
down
and
died
,
like
the
old
goat
in
the
cave
.
I
had
also
arrived
to
some
*NL*
little
diversions
and
amusements
,
which
made
the
time
pass
a
great
deal
*NL*
more
pleasantly
with
me
than
it
did
before
--
first
,
I
had
taught
my
Poll
,
*NL*
as
I
noted
before
,
to
speak
;
and
he
did
it
so
familiarly
,
and
talked
so
*NL*
articulately
and
plain
,
that
it
was
very
pleasant
to
me
;
and
he
lived
*NL*
with
me
no
less
than
six-and-twenty
years
.
How
long
he
might
have
lived
*NL*
afterwards
I
know
not
,
though
I
know
they
have
a
notion
in
the
Brazils
*NL*
that
they
live
a
hundred
years
.
My
dog
was
a
pleasant
and
loving
*NL*
companion
to
me
for
no
less
than
sixteen
years
of
my
time
,
and
then
died
*NL*
of
mere
old
age
.
As
for
my
cats
,
they
multiplied
,
as
I
have
observed
,
to
*NL*
that
degree
that
I
was
obliged
to
shoot
several
of
them
at
first
,
to
keep
*NL*
them
from
devouring
me
and
all
I
had
;
but
at
length
,
when
the
two
old
*NL*
ones
I
brought
with
me
were
gone
,
and
after
some
time
continually
driving
*NL*
them
from
me
,
and
letting
them
have
no
provision
with
me
,
they
all
ran
*NL*
wild
into
the
woods
,
except
two
or
three
favourites
,
which
I
kept
tame
,
*NL*
and
whose
young
,
when
they
had
any
,
I
always
drowned
;
and
these
were
part
*NL*
of
my
family
.
Besides
these
I
always
kept
two
or
three
household
kids
*NL*
about
me
,
whom
I
taught
to
feed
out
of
my
hand
;
and
I
had
two
more
*NL*
parrots
,
which
talked
pretty
well
,
and
would
all
call
``
Robin
Crusoe
,
''
but
*NL*
none
like
my
first
;
nor
,
indeed
,
did
I
take
the
pains
with
any
of
them
*NL*
that
I
had
done
with
him
.
I
had
also
several
tame
sea-fowls
,
whose
name
*NL*
I
knew
not
,
that
I
caught
upon
the
shore
,
and
cut
their
wings
;
and
the
*NL*
little
stakes
which
I
had
planted
before
my
castle-wall
being
now
grown
*NL*
up
to
a
good
thick
grove
,
these
fowls
all
lived
among
these
low
trees
,
*NL*
and
bred
there
,
which
was
very
agreeable
to
me
;
so
that
,
as
I
said
above
,
*NL*
I
began
to
be
very
well
contented
with
the
life
I
led
,
if
I
could
have
*NL*
been
secured
from
the
dread
of
the
savages
.
But
it
was
otherwise
*NL*
directed
;
and
it
may
not
be
amiss
for
all
people
who
shall
meet
with
my
*NL*
story
to
make
this
just
observation
from
it
:
How
frequently
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
our
lives
,
the
evil
which
in
itself
we
seek
most
to
shun
,
and
*NL*
which
,
when
we
are
fallen
into
,
is
the
most
dreadful
to
us
,
is
oftentimes
*NL*
the
very
means
or
door
of
our
deliverance
,
by
which
alone
we
can
be
*NL*
raised
again
from
the
affliction
we
are
fallen
into
.
I
could
give
many
*NL*
examples
of
this
in
the
course
of
my
unaccountable
life
;
but
in
nothing
*NL*
was
it
more
particularly
remarkable
than
in
the
circumstances
of
my
last
*NL*
years
of
solitary
residence
in
this
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
the
month
of
December
,
as
I
said
above
,
in
my
twenty-third
*NL*
year
;
and
this
,
being
the
southern
solstice
-LRB-
for
winter
I
can
not
call
*NL*
it
-RRB-
,
was
the
particular
time
of
my
harvest
,
and
required
me
to
be
pretty
*NL*
much
abroad
in
the
fields
,
when
,
going
out
early
in
the
morning
,
even
*NL*
before
it
was
thorough
daylight
,
I
was
surprised
with
seeing
a
light
of
*NL*
some
fire
upon
the
shore
,
at
a
distance
from
me
of
about
two
miles
,
*NL*
toward
that
part
of
the
island
where
I
had
observed
some
savages
had
*NL*
been
,
as
before
,
and
not
on
the
other
side
;
but
,
to
my
great
affliction
,
*NL*
it
was
on
my
side
of
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
indeed
terribly
surprised
at
the
sight
,
and
stopped
short
within
my
*NL*
grove
,
not
daring
to
go
out
,
lest
I
might
be
surprised
;
and
yet
I
had
no
*NL*
more
peace
within
,
from
the
apprehensions
I
had
that
if
these
savages
,
in
*NL*
rambling
over
the
island
,
should
find
my
corn
standing
or
cut
,
or
any
of
*NL*
my
works
or
improvements
,
they
would
immediately
conclude
that
there
were
*NL*
people
in
the
place
,
and
would
then
never
rest
till
they
had
found
me
*NL*
out
.
In
this
extremity
I
went
back
directly
to
my
castle
,
pulled
up
the
*NL*
ladder
after
me
,
and
made
all
things
without
look
as
wild
and
natural
as
*NL*
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
prepared
myself
within
,
putting
myself
in
a
posture
of
defence
.
I
*NL*
loaded
all
my
cannon
,
as
I
called
them
--
that
is
to
say
,
my
muskets
,
which
*NL*
were
mounted
upon
my
new
fortification
--
and
all
my
pistols
,
and
resolved
*NL*
to
defend
myself
to
the
last
gasp
--
not
forgetting
seriously
to
commend
*NL*
myself
to
the
Divine
protection
,
and
earnestly
to
pray
to
God
to
deliver
*NL*
me
out
of
the
hands
of
the
barbarians
.
I
continued
in
this
posture
about
*NL*
two
hours
,
and
began
to
be
impatient
for
intelligence
abroad
,
for
I
had
*NL*
no
spies
to
send
out
.
After
sitting
a
while
longer
,
and
musing
what
I
*NL*
should
do
in
this
case
,
I
was
not
able
to
bear
sitting
in
ignorance
*NL*
longer
;
so
setting
up
my
ladder
to
the
side
of
the
hill
,
where
there
was
*NL*
a
flat
place
,
as
I
observed
before
,
and
then
pulling
the
ladder
after
me
,
*NL*
I
set
it
up
again
and
mounted
the
top
of
the
hill
,
and
pulling
out
my
*NL*
perspective
glass
,
which
I
had
taken
on
purpose
,
I
laid
me
down
flat
on
*NL*
my
belly
on
the
ground
,
and
began
to
look
for
the
place
.
I
presently
*NL*
found
there
were
no
less
than
nine
naked
savages
sitting
round
a
small
*NL*
fire
they
had
made
,
not
to
warm
them
,
for
they
had
no
need
of
that
,
the
*NL*
weather
being
extremely
hot
,
but
,
as
I
supposed
,
to
dress
some
of
their
*NL*
barbarous
diet
of
human
flesh
which
they
had
brought
with
them
,
whether
*NL*
alive
or
dead
I
could
not
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
two
canoes
with
them
,
which
they
had
hauled
up
upon
the
shore
;
*NL*
and
as
it
was
then
ebb
of
tide
,
they
seemed
to
me
to
wait
for
the
return
*NL*
of
the
flood
to
go
away
again
.
It
is
not
easy
to
imagine
what
confusion
*NL*
this
sight
put
me
into
,
especially
seeing
them
come
on
my
side
of
the
*NL*
island
,
and
so
near
to
me
;
but
when
I
considered
their
coming
must
be
*NL*
always
with
the
current
of
the
ebb
,
I
began
afterwards
to
be
more
sedate
*NL*
in
my
mind
,
being
satisfied
that
I
might
go
abroad
with
safety
all
the
*NL*
time
of
the
flood
of
tide
,
if
they
were
not
on
shore
before
;
and
having
*NL*
made
this
observation
,
I
went
abroad
about
my
harvest
work
with
the
more
*NL*
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
expected
,
so
it
proved
;
for
as
soon
as
the
tide
made
to
the
westward
*NL*
I
saw
them
all
take
boat
and
row
-LRB-
or
paddle
as
we
call
it
-RRB-
away
.
I
*NL*
should
have
observed
,
that
for
an
hour
or
more
before
they
went
off
they
*NL*
were
dancing
,
and
I
could
easily
discern
their
postures
and
gestures
by
*NL*
my
glass
.
I
could
not
perceive
,
by
my
nicest
observation
,
but
that
they
*NL*
were
stark
naked
,
and
had
not
the
least
covering
upon
them
;
but
whether
*NL*
they
were
men
or
women
I
could
not
distinguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
saw
them
shipped
and
gone
,
I
took
two
guns
upon
my
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
two
pistols
in
my
girdle
,
and
my
great
sword
by
my
side
*NL*
without
a
scabbard
,
and
with
all
the
speed
I
was
able
to
make
went
away
*NL*
to
the
hill
where
I
had
discovered
the
first
appearance
of
all
;
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
get
thither
,
which
was
not
in
less
than
two
hours
-LRB-
for
I
could
*NL*
not
go
quickly
,
being
so
loaded
with
arms
as
I
was
-RRB-
,
I
perceived
there
*NL*
had
been
three
canoes
more
of
the
savages
at
that
place
;
and
looking
out
*NL*
farther
,
I
saw
they
were
all
at
sea
together
,
making
over
for
the
main
.
*NL*
This
was
a
dreadful
sight
to
me
,
especially
as
,
going
down
to
the
shore
,
*NL*
I
could
see
the
marks
of
horror
which
the
dismal
work
they
had
been
about
*NL*
had
left
behind
it
--
viz
.
the
blood
,
the
bones
,
and
part
of
the
flesh
of
*NL*
human
bodies
eaten
and
devoured
by
those
wretches
with
merriment
and
*NL*
sport
.
I
was
so
filled
with
indignation
at
the
sight
,
that
I
now
began
*NL*
to
premeditate
the
destruction
of
the
next
that
I
saw
there
,
let
them
be
*NL*
whom
or
how
many
soever
.
It
seemed
evident
to
me
that
the
visits
which
*NL*
they
made
thus
to
this
island
were
not
very
frequent
,
for
it
was
above
*NL*
fifteen
months
before
any
more
of
them
came
on
shore
there
again
--
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
I
neither
saw
them
nor
any
footsteps
or
signals
of
them
in
all
*NL*
that
time
;
for
as
to
the
rainy
seasons
,
then
they
are
sure
not
to
come
*NL*
abroad
,
at
least
not
so
far
.
Yet
all
this
while
I
lived
uncomfortably
,
*NL*
by
reason
of
the
constant
apprehensions
of
their
coming
upon
me
by
*NL*
surprise
:
from
whence
I
observe
,
that
the
expectation
of
evil
is
more
*NL*
bitter
than
the
suffering
,
especially
if
there
is
no
room
to
shake
off
*NL*
that
expectation
or
those
apprehensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
this
time
I
was
in
a
murdering
humour
,
and
spent
most
of
my
*NL*
hours
,
which
should
have
been
better
employed
,
in
contriving
how
to
*NL*
circumvent
and
fall
upon
them
the
very
next
time
I
should
see
*NL*
them
--
especially
if
they
should
be
divided
,
as
they
were
the
last
time
,
*NL*
into
two
parties
;
nor
did
I
consider
at
all
that
if
I
killed
one
*NL*
party
--
suppose
ten
or
a
dozen
--
I
was
still
the
next
day
,
or
week
,
or
*NL*
month
,
to
kill
another
,
and
so
another
,
even
_
ad
infinitum
_
,
till
I
*NL*
should
be
,
at
length
,
no
less
a
murderer
than
they
were
in
being
*NL*
man-eaters
--
and
perhaps
much
more
so
.
I
spent
my
days
now
in
great
*NL*
perplexity
and
anxiety
of
mind
,
expecting
that
I
should
one
day
or
other
*NL*
fall
,
into
the
hands
of
these
merciless
creatures
;
and
if
I
did
at
any
*NL*
time
venture
abroad
,
it
was
not
without
looking
around
me
with
the
*NL*
greatest
care
and
caution
imaginable
.
And
now
I
found
,
to
my
great
*NL*
comfort
,
how
happy
it
was
that
I
had
provided
a
tame
flock
or
herd
of
*NL*
goats
,
for
I
durst
not
upon
any
account
fire
my
gun
,
especially
near
that
*NL*
side
of
the
island
where
they
usually
came
,
lest
I
should
alarm
the
*NL*
savages
;
and
if
they
had
fled
from
me
now
,
I
was
sure
to
have
them
come
*NL*
again
with
perhaps
two
or
three
hundred
canoes
with
them
in
a
few
days
,
*NL*
and
then
I
knew
what
to
expect
.
However
,
I
wore
out
a
year
and
three
*NL*
months
more
before
I
ever
saw
any
more
of
the
savages
,
and
then
I
found
*NL*
them
again
,
as
I
shall
soon
observe
.
It
is
true
they
might
have
been
*NL*
there
once
or
twice
;
but
either
they
made
no
stay
,
or
at
least
I
did
not
*NL*
see
them
;
but
in
the
month
of
May
,
as
near
as
I
could
calculate
,
and
in
*NL*
my
four-and-twentieth
year
,
I
had
a
very
strange
encounter
with
them
;
of
*NL*
which
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
perturbation
of
my
mind
during
this
fifteen
or
sixteen
months
'
*NL*
interval
was
very
great
;
I
slept
unquietly
,
dreamed
always
frightful
*NL*
dreams
,
and
often
started
out
of
my
sleep
in
the
night
.
In
the
day
great
*NL*
troubles
overwhelmed
my
mind
;
and
in
the
night
I
dreamed
often
of
killing
*NL*
the
savages
and
of
the
reasons
why
I
might
justify
doing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
waive
all
this
for
a
while
.
It
was
in
the
middle
of
May
,
on
the
*NL*
sixteenth
day
,
I
think
,
as
well
as
my
poor
wooden
calendar
would
reckon
,
*NL*
for
I
marked
all
upon
the
post
still
;
I
say
,
it
was
on
the
sixteenth
of
*NL*
May
that
it
blew
a
very
great
storm
of
wind
all
day
,
with
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
lightning
and
thunder
,
and
;
a
very
foul
night
it
was
after
it
.
I
knew
*NL*
not
what
was
the
particular
occasion
of
it
,
but
as
I
was
reading
in
the
*NL*
Bible
,
and
taken
up
with
very
serious
thoughts
about
my
present
*NL*
condition
,
I
was
surprised
with
the
noise
of
a
gun
,
as
I
thought
,
fired
*NL*
at
sea
.
This
was
,
to
be
sure
,
a
surprise
quite
of
a
different
nature
*NL*
from
any
I
had
met
with
before
;
for
the
notions
this
put
into
my
thoughts
*NL*
were
quite
of
another
kind
.
I
started
up
in
the
greatest
haste
*NL*
imaginable
;
and
,
in
a
trice
,
clapped
my
ladder
to
the
middle
place
of
the
*NL*
rock
,
and
pulled
it
after
me
;
and
mounting
it
the
second
time
,
got
to
the
*NL*
top
of
the
hill
the
very
moment
that
a
flash
of
fire
bid
me
listen
for
a
*NL*
second
gun
,
which
,
accordingly
,
in
about
half
a
minute
I
heard
;
and
by
*NL*
the
sound
,
knew
that
it
was
from
that
part
of
the
sea
where
I
was
driven
*NL*
down
the
current
in
my
boat
.
I
immediately
considered
that
this
must
be
*NL*
some
ship
in
distress
,
and
that
they
had
some
comrade
,
or
some
other
ship
*NL*
in
company
,
and
fired
these
for
signals
of
distress
,
and
to
obtain
help
.
*NL*
I
had
the
presence
of
mind
at
that
minute
to
think
,
that
though
I
could
*NL*
not
help
them
,
it
might
be
that
they
might
help
me
;
so
I
brought
together
*NL*
all
the
dry
wood
I
could
get
at
hand
,
and
making
a
good
handsome
pile
,
I
*NL*
set
it
on
fire
upon
the
hill
.
The
wood
was
dry
,
and
blazed
freely
;
and
,
*NL*
though
the
wind
blew
very
hard
,
yet
it
burned
fairly
out
;
so
that
I
was
*NL*
certain
,
if
there
was
any
such
thing
as
a
ship
,
they
must
needs
see
it
.
*NL*
And
no
doubt
they
did
;
for
as
soon
as
ever
my
fire
blazed
up
,
I
heard
*NL*
another
gun
,
and
after
that
several
others
,
all
from
the
same
quarter
.
I
*NL*
plied
my
fire
all
night
long
,
till
daybreak
:
and
when
it
was
broad
day
,
*NL*
and
the
air
cleared
up
,
I
saw
something
at
a
great
distance
at
sea
,
full
*NL*
east
of
the
island
,
whether
a
sail
or
a
hull
I
could
not
distinguish
--
no
,
*NL*
not
with
my
glass
:
the
distance
was
so
great
,
and
the
weather
still
*NL*
something
hazy
also
;
at
least
,
it
was
so
out
at
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
frequently
at
it
all
that
day
,
and
soon
perceived
that
it
did
*NL*
not
move
;
so
I
presently
concluded
that
it
was
a
ship
at
anchor
;
and
*NL*
being
eager
,
you
may
be
sure
,
to
be
satisfied
,
I
took
my
gun
in
my
hand
,
*NL*
and
ran
towards
the
south
side
of
the
island
to
the
rocks
where
I
had
*NL*
formerly
been
carried
away
by
the
current
;
and
getting
up
there
,
the
*NL*
weather
by
this
time
being
perfectly
clear
,
I
could
plainly
see
,
to
my
*NL*
great
sorrow
,
the
wreck
of
a
ship
,
cast
away
in
the
night
upon
those
*NL*
concealed
rocks
which
I
found
when
I
was
out
in
my
boat
;
and
which
rocks
,
*NL*
as
they
checked
the
violence
of
the
stream
,
and
made
a
kind
of
*NL*
counter-stream
,
or
eddy
,
were
the
occasion
of
my
recovering
from
the
most
*NL*
desperate
,
hopeless
condition
that
ever
I
had
been
in
in
all
my
life
.
*NL*
Thus
,
what
is
one
man
's
safety
is
another
man
's
destruction
;
for
it
seems
*NL*
these
men
,
whoever
they
were
,
being
out
of
their
knowledge
,
and
the
rocks
*NL*
being
wholly
under
water
,
had
been
driven
upon
them
in
the
night
,
the
*NL*
wind
blowing
hard
at
ENE
.
Had
they
seen
the
island
,
as
I
must
*NL*
necessarily
suppose
they
did
not
,
they
must
,
as
I
thought
,
have
*NL*
endeavoured
to
have
saved
themselves
on
shore
by
the
help
of
their
boat
;
*NL*
but
their
firing
off
guns
for
help
,
especially
when
they
saw
,
as
I
*NL*
imagined
,
my
fire
,
filled
me
with
many
thoughts
.
First
,
I
imagined
that
*NL*
upon
seeing
my
light
they
might
have
put
themselves
into
their
boat
,
and
*NL*
endeavoured
to
make
the
shore
:
but
that
the
sea
running
very
high
,
they
*NL*
might
have
been
cast
away
.
Other
times
I
imagined
that
they
might
have
*NL*
lost
their
boat
before
,
as
might
be
the
case
many
ways
;
particularly
by
*NL*
the
breaking
of
the
sea
upon
their
ship
,
which
many
times
obliged
men
to
*NL*
stave
,
or
take
in
pieces
,
their
boat
,
and
sometimes
to
throw
it
overboard
*NL*
with
their
own
hands
.
Other
times
I
imagined
they
had
some
other
ship
or
*NL*
ships
in
company
,
who
,
upon
the
signals
of
distress
they
made
,
had
taken
*NL*
them
up
,
and
carried
them
off
.
Other
times
I
fancied
they
were
all
gone
*NL*
off
to
sea
in
their
boat
,
and
being
hurried
away
by
the
current
that
I
*NL*
had
been
formerly
in
,
were
carried
out
into
the
great
ocean
,
where
there
*NL*
was
nothing
but
misery
and
perishing
:
and
that
,
perhaps
,
they
might
by
*NL*
this
time
think
of
starving
,
and
of
being
in
a
condition
to
eat
one
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
all
these
were
but
conjectures
at
best
,
so
,
in
the
condition
I
was
in
,
*NL*
I
could
do
no
more
than
look
on
upon
the
misery
of
the
poor
men
,
and
pity
*NL*
them
;
which
had
still
this
good
effect
upon
my
side
,
that
it
gave
me
more
*NL*
and
more
cause
to
give
thanks
to
God
,
who
had
so
happily
and
comfortably
*NL*
provided
for
me
in
my
desolate
condition
;
and
that
of
two
ships
'
*NL*
companies
,
who
were
now
cast
away
upon
this
part
of
the
world
,
not
one
*NL*
life
should
be
spared
but
mine
.
I
learned
here
again
to
observe
,
that
it
*NL*
is
very
rare
that
the
providence
of
God
casts
us
into
any
condition
so
*NL*
low
,
or
any
misery
so
great
,
but
we
may
see
something
or
other
to
be
*NL*
thankful
for
,
and
may
see
others
in
worse
circumstances
than
our
own
.
*NL*
Such
certainly
was
the
case
of
these
men
,
of
whom
I
could
not
so
much
as
*NL*
see
room
to
suppose
any
were
saved
;
nothing
could
make
it
rational
so
*NL*
much
as
to
wish
or
expect
that
they
did
not
all
perish
there
,
except
the
*NL*
possibility
only
of
their
being
taken
up
by
another
ship
in
company
;
and
*NL*
this
was
but
mere
possibility
indeed
,
for
I
saw
not
the
least
sign
or
*NL*
appearance
of
any
such
thing
.
I
can
not
explain
,
by
any
possible
energy
*NL*
of
words
,
what
a
strange
longing
I
felt
in
my
soul
upon
this
sight
,
*NL*
breaking
out
sometimes
thus
:
``
Oh
that
there
had
been
but
one
or
two
,
nay
,
*NL*
or
but
one
soul
saved
out
of
this
ship
,
to
have
escaped
to
me
,
that
I
*NL*
might
but
have
had
one
companion
,
one
fellow-creature
,
to
have
spoken
to
*NL*
me
and
to
have
conversed
with
!
''
In
all
the
time
of
my
solitary
life
I
*NL*
never
felt
so
earnest
,
so
strong
a
desire
after
the
society
of
my
*NL*
fellow-creatures
,
or
so
deep
a
regret
at
the
want
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
some
secret
springs
in
the
affections
which
,
when
they
are
set
*NL*
a-going
by
some
object
in
view
,
or
,
though
not
in
view
,
yet
rendered
*NL*
present
to
the
mind
by
the
power
of
imagination
,
that
motion
carries
out
*NL*
the
soul
,
by
its
impetuosity
,
to
such
violent
,
eager
embracings
of
the
*NL*
object
,
that
the
absence
of
it
is
insupportable
.
Such
were
these
earnest
*NL*
wishings
that
but
one
man
had
been
saved
.
I
believe
I
repeated
the
*NL*
words
,
``
Oh
that
it
had
been
but
one
!
''
a
thousand
times
;
and
my
desires
*NL*
were
so
moved
by
it
,
that
when
I
spoke
the
words
my
hands
would
clinch
*NL*
together
,
and
my
fingers
would
press
the
palms
of
my
hands
,
so
that
if
I
*NL*
had
had
any
soft
thing
in
my
hand
I
should
have
crushed
it
involuntarily
;
*NL*
and
the
teeth
in
my
head
would
strike
together
,
and
set
against
one
*NL*
another
so
strong
,
that
for
some
time
I
could
not
part
them
again
.
Let
*NL*
the
naturalists
explain
these
things
,
and
the
reason
and
manner
of
them
.
*NL*
All
I
can
do
is
to
describe
the
fact
,
which
was
even
surprising
to
me
*NL*
when
I
found
it
,
though
I
knew
not
from
whence
it
proceeded
;
it
was
*NL*
doubtless
the
effect
of
ardent
wishes
,
and
of
strong
ideas
formed
in
my
*NL*
mind
,
realising
the
comfort
which
the
conversation
of
one
of
my
*NL*
fellow-Christians
would
have
been
to
me
.
But
it
was
not
to
be
;
either
*NL*
their
fate
or
mine
,
or
both
,
forbade
it
;
for
,
till
the
last
year
of
my
*NL*
being
on
this
island
,
I
never
knew
whether
any
were
saved
out
of
that
*NL*
ship
or
no
;
and
had
only
the
affliction
,
some
days
after
,
to
see
the
*NL*
corpse
of
a
drowned
boy
come
on
shore
at
the
end
of
the
island
which
was
*NL*
next
the
shipwreck
.
He
had
no
clothes
on
but
a
seaman
's
waistcoat
,
a
*NL*
pair
of
open-kneed
linen
drawers
,
and
a
blue
linen
shirt
;
but
nothing
to
*NL*
direct
me
so
much
as
to
guess
what
nation
he
was
of
.
He
had
nothing
in
*NL*
his
pockets
but
two
pieces
of
eight
and
a
tobacco
pipe
--
the
last
was
to
*NL*
me
of
ten
times
more
value
than
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
calm
,
and
I
had
a
great
mind
to
venture
out
in
my
boat
to
this
*NL*
wreck
,
not
doubting
but
I
might
find
something
on
board
that
might
be
*NL*
useful
to
me
.
But
that
did
not
altogether
press
me
so
much
as
the
*NL*
possibility
that
there
might
be
yet
some
living
creature
on
board
,
whose
*NL*
life
I
might
not
only
save
,
but
might
,
by
saving
that
life
,
comfort
my
*NL*
own
to
the
last
degree
;
and
this
thought
clung
so
to
my
heart
that
I
*NL*
could
not
be
quiet
night
or
day
,
but
I
must
venture
out
in
my
boat
on
*NL*
board
this
wreck
;
and
committing
the
rest
to
God
's
providence
,
I
thought
*NL*
the
impression
was
so
strong
upon
my
mind
that
it
could
not
be
*NL*
resisted
--
that
it
must
come
from
some
invisible
direction
,
and
that
I
*NL*
should
be
wanting
to
myself
if
I
did
not
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
power
of
this
impression
,
I
hastened
back
to
my
castle
,
*NL*
prepared
everything
for
my
voyage
,
took
a
quantity
of
bread
,
a
great
pot
*NL*
of
fresh
water
,
a
compass
to
steer
by
,
a
bottle
of
rum
-LRB-
for
I
had
still
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
that
left
-RRB-
,
and
a
basket
of
raisins
;
and
thus
,
loading
*NL*
myself
with
everything
necessary
.
I
went
down
to
my
boat
,
got
the
water
*NL*
out
of
her
,
got
her
afloat
,
loaded
all
my
cargo
in
her
,
and
then
went
*NL*
home
again
for
more
.
My
second
cargo
was
a
great
bag
of
rice
,
the
*NL*
umbrella
to
set
up
over
my
head
for
a
shade
,
another
large
pot
of
water
,
*NL*
and
about
two
dozen
of
small
loaves
,
or
barley
cakes
,
more
than
before
,
*NL*
with
a
bottle
of
goat
's
milk
and
a
cheese
;
all
which
with
great
labour
*NL*
and
sweat
I
carried
to
my
boat
;
and
praying
to
God
to
direct
my
voyage
,
I
*NL*
put
out
,
and
rowing
or
paddling
the
canoe
along
the
shore
,
came
at
last
*NL*
to
the
utmost
point
of
the
island
on
the
north-east
side
.
And
now
I
was
*NL*
to
launch
out
into
the
ocean
,
and
either
to
venture
or
not
to
venture
.
I
*NL*
looked
on
the
rapid
currents
which
ran
constantly
on
both
sides
of
the
*NL*
island
at
a
distance
,
and
which
were
very
terrible
to
me
from
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
the
hazard
I
had
been
in
before
,
and
my
heart
began
to
*NL*
fail
me
;
for
I
foresaw
that
if
I
was
driven
into
either
of
those
*NL*
currents
,
I
should
be
carried
a
great
way
out
to
sea
,
and
perhaps
out
of
*NL*
my
reach
or
sight
of
the
island
again
;
and
that
then
,
as
my
boat
was
but
*NL*
small
,
if
any
little
gale
of
wind
should
rise
,
I
should
be
inevitably
*NL*
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
so
oppressed
my
mind
that
I
began
to
give
over
my
*NL*
enterprise
;
and
having
hauled
my
boat
into
a
little
creek
on
the
shore
,
I
*NL*
stepped
out
,
and
sat
down
upon
a
rising
bit
of
ground
,
very
pensive
and
*NL*
anxious
,
between
fear
and
desire
,
about
my
voyage
;
when
,
as
I
was
musing
,
*NL*
I
could
perceive
that
the
tide
was
turned
,
and
the
flood
come
on
;
upon
*NL*
which
my
going
was
impracticable
for
so
many
hours
.
Upon
this
,
presently
*NL*
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
should
go
up
to
the
highest
piece
of
ground
I
*NL*
could
find
,
and
observe
,
if
I
could
,
how
the
sets
of
the
tide
or
currents
*NL*
lay
when
the
flood
came
in
,
that
I
might
judge
whether
,
if
I
was
driven
*NL*
one
way
out
,
I
might
not
expect
to
be
driven
another
way
home
,
with
the
*NL*
same
rapidity
of
the
currents
.
This
thought
was
no
sooner
in
my
head
*NL*
than
I
cast
my
eye
upon
a
little
hill
which
sufficiently
overlooked
the
*NL*
sea
both
ways
,
and
from
whence
I
had
a
clear
view
of
the
currents
or
sets
*NL*
of
the
tide
,
and
which
way
I
was
to
guide
myself
in
my
return
.
Here
I
*NL*
found
,
that
as
the
current
of
ebb
set
out
close
by
the
south
point
of
the
*NL*
island
,
so
the
current
of
the
flood
set
in
close
by
the
shore
of
the
*NL*
north
side
;
and
that
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
to
the
north
side
of
*NL*
the
island
in
my
return
,
and
I
should
do
well
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Encouraged
by
this
observation
,
I
resolved
the
next
morning
to
set
out
*NL*
with
the
first
of
the
tide
;
and
reposing
myself
for
the
night
in
my
*NL*
canoe
,
under
the
watch-coat
I
mentioned
,
I
launched
out
.
I
first
made
a
*NL*
little
out
to
sea
,
full
north
,
till
I
began
to
feel
the
benefit
of
the
*NL*
current
,
which
set
eastward
,
and
which
carried
me
at
a
great
rate
;
and
*NL*
yet
did
not
so
hurry
me
as
the
current
on
the
south
side
had
done
before
,
*NL*
so
as
to
take
from
me
all
government
of
the
boat
;
but
having
a
strong
*NL*
steerage
with
my
paddle
,
I
went
at
a
great
rate
directly
for
the
wreck
,
*NL*
and
in
less
than
two
hours
I
came
up
to
it
.
It
was
a
dismal
sight
to
*NL*
look
at
;
the
ship
,
which
by
its
building
was
Spanish
,
stuck
fast
,
jammed
*NL*
in
between
two
rocks
.
All
the
stern
and
quarter
of
her
were
beaten
to
*NL*
pieces
by
the
sea
;
and
as
her
forecastle
,
which
stuck
in
the
rocks
,
had
*NL*
run
on
with
great
violence
,
her
mainmast
and
foremast
were
brought
by
the
*NL*
board
--
that
is
to
say
,
broken
short
off
;
but
her
bowsprit
was
sound
,
and
*NL*
the
head
and
bow
appeared
firm
.
When
I
came
close
to
her
,
a
dog
appeared
*NL*
upon
her
,
who
,
seeing
me
coming
,
yelped
and
cried
;
and
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
called
him
,
jumped
into
the
sea
to
come
to
me
.
I
took
him
into
the
boat
,
*NL*
but
found
him
almost
dead
with
hunger
and
thirst
.
I
gave
him
a
cake
of
*NL*
my
bread
,
and
he
devoured
it
like
a
ravenous
wolf
that
had
been
starving
*NL*
a
fortnight
in
the
snow
;
I
then
gave
the
poor
creature
some
fresh
water
,
*NL*
with
which
,
if
I
would
have
let
him
,
he
would
have
burst
himself
.
After
*NL*
this
I
went
on
board
;
but
the
first
sight
I
met
with
was
two
men
drowned
*NL*
in
the
cook-room
,
or
forecastle
of
the
ship
,
with
their
arms
fast
about
*NL*
one
another
.
I
concluded
,
as
is
indeed
probable
,
that
when
the
ship
*NL*
struck
,
it
being
in
a
storm
,
the
sea
broke
so
high
and
so
continually
*NL*
over
her
,
that
the
men
were
not
able
to
bear
it
,
and
were
strangled
with
*NL*
the
constant
rushing
in
of
the
water
,
as
much
as
if
they
had
been
under
*NL*
water
.
Besides
the
dog
,
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
ship
that
had
*NL*
life
;
nor
any
goods
,
that
I
could
see
,
but
what
were
spoiled
by
the
*NL*
water
.
There
were
some
casks
of
liquor
,
whether
wine
or
brandy
I
knew
*NL*
not
,
which
lay
lower
in
the
hold
,
and
which
,
the
water
being
ebbed
out
,
I
*NL*
could
see
;
but
they
were
too
big
to
meddle
with
.
I
saw
several
chests
,
*NL*
which
I
believe
belonged
to
some
of
the
seamen
;
and
I
got
two
of
them
*NL*
into
the
boat
,
without
examining
what
was
in
them
.
Had
the
stern
of
the
*NL*
ship
been
fixed
,
and
the
forepart
broken
off
,
I
am
persuaded
I
might
have
*NL*
made
a
good
voyage
;
for
by
what
I
found
in
those
two
chests
I
had
room
to
*NL*
suppose
the
ship
had
a
great
deal
of
wealth
on
board
;
and
,
if
I
may
guess
*NL*
from
the
course
she
steered
,
she
must
have
been
bound
from
Buenos
Ayres
,
*NL*
or
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
,
in
the
south
part
of
America
,
beyond
the
Brazils
*NL*
to
the
Havannah
,
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
and
so
perhaps
to
Spain
.
She
*NL*
had
,
no
doubt
,
a
great
treasure
in
her
,
but
of
no
use
,
at
that
time
,
to
*NL*
anybody
;
and
what
became
of
the
crew
I
then
knew
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
,
besides
these
chests
,
a
little
cask
full
of
liquor
,
of
about
*NL*
twenty
gallons
,
which
I
got
into
my
boat
with
much
difficulty
.
There
*NL*
were
several
muskets
in
the
cabin
,
and
a
great
powder-horn
,
with
about
*NL*
four
pounds
of
powder
in
it
;
as
for
the
muskets
,
I
had
no
occasion
for
*NL*
them
,
so
I
left
them
,
but
took
the
powder-horn
.
I
took
a
fire-shovel
and
*NL*
tongs
,
which
I
wanted
extremely
,
as
also
two
little
brass
kettles
,
a
*NL*
copper
pot
to
make
chocolate
,
and
a
gridiron
;
and
with
this
cargo
,
and
*NL*
the
dog
,
I
came
away
,
the
tide
beginning
to
make
home
again
--
and
the
same
*NL*
evening
,
about
an
hour
within
night
,
I
reached
the
island
again
,
weary
*NL*
and
fatigued
to
the
last
degree
.
I
reposed
that
night
in
the
boat
and
in
*NL*
the
morning
I
resolved
to
harbour
what
I
had
got
in
my
new
cave
,
and
not
*NL*
carry
it
home
to
my
castle
.
After
refreshing
myself
,
I
got
all
my
cargo
*NL*
on
shore
,
and
began
to
examine
the
particulars
.
The
cask
of
liquor
I
*NL*
found
to
be
a
kind
of
rum
,
but
not
such
as
we
had
at
the
Brazils
;
and
,
in
*NL*
a
word
,
not
at
all
good
;
but
when
I
came
to
open
the
chests
,
I
found
*NL*
several
things
of
great
use
to
me
--
for
example
,
I
found
in
one
a
fine
*NL*
case
of
bottles
,
of
an
extraordinary
kind
,
and
filled
with
cordial
*NL*
waters
,
fine
and
very
good
;
the
bottles
held
about
three
pints
each
,
and
*NL*
were
tipped
with
silver
.
I
found
two
pots
of
very
good
succades
,
or
*NL*
sweetmeats
,
so
fastened
also
on
the
top
that
the
salt-water
had
not
hurt
*NL*
them
;
and
two
more
of
the
same
,
which
the
water
had
spoiled
.
I
found
*NL*
some
very
good
shirts
,
which
were
very
welcome
to
me
;
and
about
a
dozen
*NL*
and
a
half
of
white
linen
handkerchiefs
and
coloured
neckcloths
;
the
*NL*
former
were
also
very
welcome
,
being
exceedingly
refreshing
to
wipe
my
*NL*
face
in
a
hot
day
.
Besides
this
,
when
I
came
to
the
till
in
the
chest
,
I
*NL*
found
there
three
great
bags
of
pieces
of
eight
,
which
held
about
eleven
*NL*
hundred
pieces
in
all
;
and
in
one
of
them
,
wrapped
up
in
a
paper
,
six
*NL*
doubloons
of
gold
,
and
some
small
bars
or
wedges
of
gold
;
I
suppose
they
*NL*
might
all
weigh
near
a
pound
.
In
the
other
chest
were
some
clothes
,
but
*NL*
of
little
value
;
but
,
by
the
circumstances
,
it
must
have
belonged
to
the
*NL*
gunner
's
mate
;
though
there
was
no
powder
in
it
,
except
two
pounds
of
*NL*
fine
glazed
powder
,
in
three
flasks
,
kept
,
I
suppose
,
for
charging
their
*NL*
fowling-pieces
on
occasion
.
Upon
the
whole
,
I
got
very
little
by
this
*NL*
voyage
that
was
of
any
use
to
me
;
for
,
as
to
the
money
,
I
had
no
manner
*NL*
of
occasion
for
it
;
it
was
to
me
as
the
dirt
under
my
feet
,
and
I
would
*NL*
have
given
it
all
for
three
or
four
pair
of
English
shoes
and
stockings
,
*NL*
which
were
things
I
greatly
wanted
,
but
had
had
none
on
my
feet
for
many
*NL*
years
.
I
had
,
indeed
,
got
two
pair
of
shoes
now
,
which
I
took
off
the
*NL*
feet
of
two
drowned
men
whom
I
saw
in
the
wreck
,
and
I
found
two
pair
*NL*
more
in
one
of
the
chests
,
which
were
very
welcome
to
me
;
but
they
were
*NL*
not
like
our
English
shoes
,
either
for
ease
or
service
,
being
rather
what
*NL*
we
call
pumps
than
shoes
.
I
found
in
this
seaman
's
chest
about
fifty
*NL*
pieces
of
eight
,
in
rials
,
but
no
gold
:
I
supposed
this
belonged
to
a
*NL*
poorer
man
than
the
other
,
which
seemed
to
belong
to
some
officer
.
Well
,
*NL*
however
,
I
lugged
this
money
home
to
my
cave
,
and
laid
it
up
,
as
I
had
*NL*
done
that
before
which
I
had
brought
from
our
own
ship
;
but
it
was
a
*NL*
great
pity
,
as
I
said
,
that
the
other
part
of
this
ship
had
not
come
to
*NL*
my
share
:
for
I
am
satisfied
I
might
have
loaded
my
canoe
several
times
*NL*
over
with
money
;
and
,
thought
I
,
if
I
ever
escape
to
England
,
it
might
*NL*
lie
here
safe
enough
till
I
come
again
and
fetch
it
.

CHAPTER
XIV
--
A
DREAM
REALISED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Having
now
brought
all
my
things
on
shore
and
secured
them
,
I
went
back
*NL*
to
my
boat
,
and
rowed
or
paddled
her
along
the
shore
to
her
old
harbour
,
*NL*
where
I
laid
her
up
,
and
made
the
best
of
my
way
to
my
old
habitation
,
*NL*
where
I
found
everything
safe
and
quiet
.
I
began
now
to
repose
myself
,
*NL*
live
after
my
old
fashion
,
and
take
care
of
my
family
affairs
;
and
for
a
*NL*
while
I
lived
easy
enough
,
only
that
I
was
more
vigilant
than
I
used
to
*NL*
be
,
looked
out
oftener
,
and
did
not
go
abroad
so
much
;
and
if
at
any
time
*NL*
I
did
stir
with
any
freedom
,
it
was
always
to
the
east
part
of
the
*NL*
island
,
where
I
was
pretty
well
satisfied
the
savages
never
came
,
and
*NL*
where
I
could
go
without
so
many
precautions
,
and
such
a
load
of
arms
and
*NL*
ammunition
as
I
always
carried
with
me
if
I
went
the
other
way
.
I
lived
*NL*
in
this
condition
near
two
years
more
;
but
my
unlucky
head
,
that
was
*NL*
always
to
let
me
know
it
was
born
to
make
my
body
miserable
,
was
all
*NL*
these
two
years
filled
with
projects
and
designs
how
,
if
it
were
*NL*
possible
,
I
might
get
away
from
this
island
:
for
sometimes
I
was
for
*NL*
making
another
voyage
to
the
wreck
,
though
my
reason
told
me
that
there
*NL*
was
nothing
left
there
worth
the
hazard
of
my
voyage
;
sometimes
for
a
*NL*
ramble
one
way
,
sometimes
another
--
and
I
believe
verily
,
if
I
had
had
the
*NL*
boat
that
I
went
from
Sallee
in
,
I
should
have
ventured
to
sea
,
bound
*NL*
anywhere
,
I
knew
not
whither
.
I
have
been
,
in
all
my
circumstances
,
a
*NL*
memento
to
those
who
are
touched
with
the
general
plague
of
mankind
,
*NL*
whence
,
for
aught
I
know
,
one
half
of
their
miseries
flow
:
I
mean
that
of
*NL*
not
being
satisfied
with
the
station
wherein
God
and
Nature
hath
placed
*NL*
them
--
for
,
not
to
look
back
upon
my
primitive
condition
,
and
the
*NL*
excellent
advice
of
my
father
,
the
opposition
to
which
was
,
as
I
may
call
*NL*
it
,
my
_
original
sin
_
,
my
subsequent
mistakes
of
the
same
kind
had
been
*NL*
the
means
of
my
coming
into
this
miserable
condition
;
for
had
that
*NL*
Providence
which
so
happily
seated
me
at
the
Brazils
as
a
planter
blessed
*NL*
me
with
confined
desires
,
and
I
could
have
been
contented
to
have
gone
on
*NL*
gradually
,
I
might
have
been
by
this
time
--
I
mean
in
the
time
of
my
being
*NL*
in
this
island
--
one
of
the
most
considerable
planters
in
the
*NL*
Brazils
--
nay
,
I
am
persuaded
,
that
by
the
improvements
I
had
made
in
that
*NL*
little
time
I
lived
there
,
and
the
increase
I
should
probably
have
made
*NL*
if
I
had
remained
,
I
might
have
been
worth
a
hundred
thousand
*NL*
moidores
--
and
what
business
had
I
to
leave
a
settled
fortune
,
a
*NL*
well-stocked
plantation
,
improving
and
increasing
,
to
turn
supercargo
to
*NL*
Guinea
to
fetch
negroes
,
when
patience
and
time
would
have
so
increased
*NL*
our
stock
at
home
,
that
we
could
have
bought
them
at
our
own
door
from
*NL*
those
whose
business
it
was
to
fetch
them
?
and
though
it
had
cost
us
*NL*
something
more
,
yet
the
difference
of
that
price
was
by
no
means
worth
*NL*
saving
at
so
great
a
hazard
.
But
as
this
is
usually
the
fate
of
young
*NL*
heads
,
so
reflection
upon
the
folly
of
it
is
as
commonly
the
exercise
of
*NL*
more
years
,
or
of
the
dear-bought
experience
of
time
--
so
it
was
with
me
*NL*
now
;
and
yet
so
deep
had
the
mistake
taken
root
in
my
temper
,
that
I
*NL*
could
not
satisfy
myself
in
my
station
,
but
was
continually
poring
upon
*NL*
the
means
and
possibility
of
my
escape
from
this
place
;
and
that
I
may
,
*NL*
with
greater
pleasure
to
the
reader
,
bring
on
the
remaining
part
of
my
*NL*
story
,
it
may
not
be
improper
to
give
some
account
of
my
first
*NL*
conceptions
on
the
subject
of
this
foolish
scheme
for
my
escape
,
and
how
,
*NL*
and
upon
what
foundation
,
I
acted
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
now
to
be
supposed
retired
into
my
castle
,
after
my
late
voyage
to
*NL*
the
wreck
,
my
frigate
laid
up
and
secured
under
water
,
as
usual
,
and
my
*NL*
condition
restored
to
what
it
was
before
:
I
had
more
wealth
,
indeed
,
than
*NL*
I
had
before
,
but
was
not
at
all
the
richer
;
for
I
had
no
more
use
for
it
*NL*
than
the
Indians
of
Peru
had
before
the
Spaniards
came
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
the
nights
in
the
rainy
season
in
March
,
the
*NL*
four-and-twentieth
year
of
my
first
setting
foot
in
this
island
of
*NL*
solitude
,
I
was
lying
in
my
bed
or
hammock
,
awake
,
very
well
in
health
,
*NL*
had
no
pain
,
no
distemper
,
no
uneasiness
of
body
,
nor
any
uneasiness
of
*NL*
mind
more
than
ordinary
,
but
could
by
no
means
close
my
eyes
,
that
is
,
so
*NL*
as
to
sleep
;
no
,
not
a
wink
all
night
long
,
otherwise
than
as
follows
:
It
*NL*
is
impossible
to
set
down
the
innumerable
crowd
of
thoughts
that
whirled
*NL*
through
that
great
thoroughfare
of
the
brain
,
the
memory
,
in
this
night
's
*NL*
time
.
I
ran
over
the
whole
history
of
my
life
in
miniature
,
or
by
*NL*
abridgment
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
to
my
coming
to
this
island
,
and
also
of
*NL*
that
part
of
my
life
since
I
came
to
this
island
.
In
my
reflections
upon
*NL*
the
state
of
my
case
since
I
came
on
shore
on
this
island
,
I
was
*NL*
comparing
the
happy
posture
of
my
affairs
in
the
first
years
of
my
*NL*
habitation
here
,
with
the
life
of
anxiety
,
fear
,
and
care
which
I
had
*NL*
lived
in
ever
since
I
had
seen
the
print
of
a
foot
in
the
sand
.
Not
that
*NL*
I
did
not
believe
the
savages
had
frequented
the
island
even
all
the
*NL*
while
,
and
might
have
been
several
hundreds
of
them
at
times
on
shore
*NL*
there
;
but
I
had
never
known
it
,
and
was
incapable
of
any
apprehensions
*NL*
about
it
;
my
satisfaction
was
perfect
,
though
my
danger
was
the
same
,
and
*NL*
I
was
as
happy
in
not
knowing
my
danger
as
if
I
had
never
really
been
*NL*
exposed
to
it
.
This
furnished
my
thoughts
with
many
very
profitable
*NL*
reflections
,
and
particularly
this
one
:
How
infinitely
good
that
*NL*
Providence
is
,
which
has
provided
,
in
its
government
of
mankind
,
such
*NL*
narrow
bounds
to
his
sight
and
knowledge
of
things
;
and
though
he
walks
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
so
many
thousand
dangers
,
the
sight
of
which
,
if
*NL*
discovered
to
him
,
would
distract
his
mind
and
sink
his
spirits
,
he
is
*NL*
kept
serene
and
calm
,
by
having
the
events
of
things
hid
from
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
knowing
nothing
of
the
dangers
which
surround
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
thoughts
had
for
some
time
entertained
me
,
I
came
to
reflect
*NL*
seriously
upon
the
real
danger
I
had
been
in
for
so
many
years
in
this
*NL*
very
island
,
and
how
I
had
walked
about
in
the
greatest
security
,
and
*NL*
with
all
possible
tranquillity
,
even
when
perhaps
nothing
but
the
brow
of
*NL*
a
hill
,
a
great
tree
,
or
the
casual
approach
of
night
,
had
been
between
*NL*
me
and
the
worst
kind
of
destruction
--
viz
.
that
of
falling
into
the
hands
*NL*
of
cannibals
and
savages
,
who
would
have
seized
on
me
with
the
same
view
*NL*
as
I
would
on
a
goat
or
turtle
;
and
have
thought
it
no
more
crime
to
kill
*NL*
and
devour
me
than
I
did
of
a
pigeon
or
a
curlew
.
I
would
unjustly
*NL*
slander
myself
if
I
should
say
I
was
not
sincerely
thankful
to
my
great
*NL*
Preserver
,
to
whose
singular
protection
I
acknowledged
,
with
great
*NL*
humanity
,
all
these
unknown
deliverances
were
due
,
and
without
which
I
*NL*
must
inevitably
have
fallen
into
their
merciless
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
thoughts
were
over
,
my
head
was
for
some
time
taken
up
in
*NL*
considering
the
nature
of
these
wretched
creatures
,
I
mean
the
savages
,
*NL*
and
how
it
came
to
pass
in
the
world
that
the
wise
Governor
of
all
things
*NL*
should
give
up
any
of
His
creatures
to
such
inhumanity
--
nay
,
to
something
*NL*
so
much
below
even
brutality
itself
--
as
to
devour
its
own
kind
:
but
as
*NL*
this
ended
in
some
-LRB-
at
that
time
-RRB-
fruitless
speculations
,
it
occurred
to
*NL*
me
to
inquire
what
part
of
the
world
these
wretches
lived
in
?
how
far
off
*NL*
the
coast
was
from
whence
they
came
?
what
they
ventured
over
so
far
from
*NL*
home
for
?
what
kind
of
boats
they
had
?
and
why
I
might
not
order
myself
*NL*
and
my
business
so
that
I
might
be
able
to
go
over
thither
,
as
they
were
*NL*
to
come
to
me
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
so
much
as
troubled
myself
to
consider
what
I
should
do
with
*NL*
myself
when
I
went
thither
;
what
would
become
of
me
if
I
fell
into
the
*NL*
hands
of
these
savages
;
or
how
I
should
escape
them
if
they
attacked
me
;
*NL*
no
,
nor
so
much
as
how
it
was
possible
for
me
to
reach
the
coast
,
and
not
*NL*
to
be
attacked
by
some
or
other
of
them
,
without
any
possibility
of
*NL*
delivering
myself
:
and
if
I
should
not
fall
into
their
hands
,
what
I
*NL*
should
do
for
provision
,
or
whither
I
should
bend
my
course
:
none
of
*NL*
these
thoughts
,
I
say
,
so
much
as
came
in
my
way
;
but
my
mind
was
wholly
*NL*
bent
upon
the
notion
of
my
passing
over
in
my
boat
to
the
mainland
.
I
*NL*
looked
upon
my
present
condition
as
the
most
miserable
that
could
*NL*
possibly
be
;
that
I
was
not
able
to
throw
myself
into
anything
but
death
,
*NL*
that
could
be
called
worse
;
and
if
I
reached
the
shore
of
the
main
I
*NL*
might
perhaps
meet
with
relief
,
or
I
might
coast
along
,
as
I
did
on
the
*NL*
African
shore
,
till
I
came
to
some
inhabited
country
,
and
where
I
might
*NL*
find
some
relief
;
and
after
all
,
perhaps
I
might
fall
in
with
some
*NL*
Christian
ship
that
might
take
me
in
:
and
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
,
*NL*
I
could
but
die
,
which
would
put
an
end
to
all
these
miseries
at
once
.
*NL*
Pray
note
,
all
this
was
the
fruit
of
a
disturbed
mind
,
an
impatient
*NL*
temper
,
made
desperate
,
as
it
were
,
by
the
long
continuance
of
my
*NL*
troubles
,
and
the
disappointments
I
had
met
in
the
wreck
I
had
been
on
*NL*
board
of
,
and
where
I
had
been
so
near
obtaining
what
I
so
earnestly
*NL*
longed
for
--
somebody
to
speak
to
,
and
to
learn
some
knowledge
from
them
*NL*
of
the
place
where
I
was
,
and
of
the
probable
means
of
my
deliverance
.
I
*NL*
was
agitated
wholly
by
these
thoughts
;
all
my
calm
of
mind
,
in
my
*NL*
resignation
to
Providence
,
and
waiting
the
issue
of
the
dispositions
of
*NL*
Heaven
,
seemed
to
be
suspended
;
and
I
had
as
it
were
no
power
to
turn
my
*NL*
thoughts
to
anything
but
to
the
project
of
a
voyage
to
the
main
,
which
*NL*
came
upon
me
with
such
force
,
and
such
an
impetuosity
of
desire
,
that
it
*NL*
was
not
to
be
resisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
had
agitated
my
thoughts
for
two
hours
or
more
,
with
such
*NL*
violence
that
it
set
my
very
blood
into
a
ferment
,
and
my
pulse
beat
as
*NL*
if
I
had
been
in
a
fever
,
merely
with
the
extraordinary
fervour
of
my
*NL*
mind
about
it
,
Nature
--
as
if
I
had
been
fatigued
and
exhausted
with
the
*NL*
very
thoughts
of
it
--
threw
me
into
a
sound
sleep
.
One
would
have
thought
*NL*
I
should
have
dreamed
of
it
,
but
I
did
not
,
nor
of
anything
relating
to
*NL*
it
,
but
I
dreamed
that
as
I
was
going
out
in
the
morning
as
usual
from
my
*NL*
castle
,
I
saw
upon
the
shore
two
canoes
and
eleven
savages
coming
to
*NL*
land
,
and
that
they
brought
with
them
another
savage
whom
they
were
going
*NL*
to
kill
in
order
to
eat
him
;
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
the
savage
that
they
were
*NL*
going
to
kill
jumped
away
,
and
ran
for
his
life
;
and
I
thought
in
my
*NL*
sleep
that
he
came
running
into
my
little
thick
grove
before
my
*NL*
fortification
,
to
hide
himself
;
and
that
I
seeing
him
alone
,
and
not
*NL*
perceiving
that
the
others
sought
him
that
way
,
showed
myself
to
him
,
and
*NL*
smiling
upon
him
,
encouraged
him
:
that
he
kneeled
down
to
me
,
seeming
to
*NL*
pray
me
to
assist
him
;
upon
which
I
showed
him
my
ladder
,
made
him
go
up
,
*NL*
and
carried
him
into
my
cave
,
and
he
became
my
servant
;
and
that
as
soon
*NL*
as
I
had
got
this
man
,
I
said
to
myself
,
``
Now
I
may
certainly
venture
to
*NL*
the
mainland
,
for
this
fellow
will
serve
me
as
a
pilot
,
and
will
tell
me
*NL*
what
to
do
,
and
whither
to
go
for
provisions
,
and
whither
not
to
go
for
*NL*
fear
of
being
devoured
;
what
places
to
venture
into
,
and
what
to
shun
.
''
*NL*
I
waked
with
this
thought
;
and
was
under
such
inexpressible
impressions
*NL*
of
joy
at
the
prospect
of
my
escape
in
my
dream
,
that
the
disappointments
*NL*
which
I
felt
upon
coming
to
myself
,
and
finding
that
it
was
no
more
than
*NL*
a
dream
,
were
equally
extravagant
the
other
way
,
and
threw
me
into
a
very
*NL*
great
dejection
of
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
,
however
,
I
made
this
conclusion
:
that
my
only
way
to
go
about
*NL*
to
attempt
an
escape
was
,
to
endeavour
to
get
a
savage
into
my
*NL*
possession
:
and
,
if
possible
,
it
should
be
one
of
their
prisoners
,
whom
*NL*
they
had
condemned
to
be
eaten
,
and
should
bring
hither
to
kill
.
But
*NL*
these
thoughts
still
were
attended
with
this
difficulty
:
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
effect
this
without
attacking
a
whole
caravan
of
them
,
and
*NL*
killing
them
all
;
and
this
was
not
only
a
very
desperate
attempt
,
and
*NL*
might
miscarry
,
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
I
had
greatly
scrupled
the
*NL*
lawfulness
of
it
to
myself
;
and
my
heart
trembled
at
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
shedding
so
much
blood
,
though
it
was
for
my
deliverance
.
I
need
not
*NL*
repeat
the
arguments
which
occurred
to
me
against
this
,
they
being
the
*NL*
same
mentioned
before
;
but
though
I
had
other
reasons
to
offer
now
--
viz
.
*NL*
that
those
men
were
enemies
to
my
life
,
and
would
devour
me
if
they
*NL*
could
;
that
it
was
self-preservation
,
in
the
highest
degree
,
to
deliver
*NL*
myself
from
this
death
of
a
life
,
and
was
acting
in
my
own
defence
as
*NL*
much
as
if
they
were
actually
assaulting
me
,
and
the
like
;
I
say
though
*NL*
these
things
argued
for
it
,
yet
the
thoughts
of
shedding
human
blood
for
*NL*
my
deliverance
were
very
terrible
to
me
,
and
such
as
I
could
by
no
means
*NL*
reconcile
myself
to
for
a
great
while
.
However
,
at
last
,
after
many
*NL*
secret
disputes
with
myself
,
and
after
great
perplexities
about
it
-LRB-
for
*NL*
all
these
arguments
,
one
way
and
another
,
struggled
in
my
head
a
long
*NL*
time
-RRB-
,
the
eager
prevailing
desire
of
deliverance
at
length
mastered
all
*NL*
the
rest
;
and
I
resolved
,
if
possible
,
to
get
one
of
these
savages
into
*NL*
my
hands
,
cost
what
it
would
.
My
next
thing
was
to
contrive
how
to
do
*NL*
it
,
and
this
,
indeed
,
was
very
difficult
to
resolve
on
;
but
as
I
could
*NL*
pitch
upon
no
probable
means
for
it
,
so
I
resolved
to
put
myself
upon
the
*NL*
watch
,
to
see
them
when
they
came
on
shore
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
the
*NL*
event
;
taking
such
measures
as
the
opportunity
should
present
,
let
what
*NL*
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
resolutions
in
my
thoughts
,
I
set
myself
upon
the
scout
as
*NL*
often
as
possible
,
and
indeed
so
often
that
I
was
heartily
tired
of
it
;
*NL*
for
it
was
above
a
year
and
a
half
that
I
waited
;
and
for
great
part
of
*NL*
that
time
went
out
to
the
west
end
,
and
to
the
south-west
corner
of
the
*NL*
island
almost
every
day
,
to
look
for
canoes
,
but
none
appeared
.
This
was
*NL*
very
discouraging
,
and
began
to
trouble
me
much
,
though
I
can
not
say
that
*NL*
it
did
in
this
case
-LRB-
as
it
had
done
some
time
before
-RRB-
wear
off
the
edge
*NL*
of
my
desire
to
the
thing
;
but
the
longer
it
seemed
to
be
delayed
,
the
*NL*
more
eager
I
was
for
it
:
in
a
word
,
I
was
not
at
first
so
careful
to
shun
*NL*
the
sight
of
these
savages
,
and
avoid
being
seen
by
them
,
as
I
was
now
*NL*
eager
to
be
upon
them
.
Besides
,
I
fancied
myself
able
to
manage
one
,
*NL*
nay
,
two
or
three
savages
,
if
I
had
them
,
so
as
to
make
them
entirely
*NL*
slaves
to
me
,
to
do
whatever
I
should
direct
them
,
and
to
prevent
their
*NL*
being
able
at
any
time
to
do
me
any
hurt
.
It
was
a
great
while
that
I
*NL*
pleased
myself
with
this
affair
;
but
nothing
still
presented
itself
;
all
*NL*
my
fancies
and
schemes
came
to
nothing
,
for
no
savages
came
near
me
for
a
*NL*
great
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
year
and
a
half
after
I
entertained
these
notions
-LRB-
and
by
long
*NL*
musing
had
,
as
it
were
,
resolved
them
all
into
nothing
,
for
want
of
an
*NL*
occasion
to
put
them
into
execution
-RRB-
,
I
was
surprised
one
morning
by
*NL*
seeing
no
less
than
five
canoes
all
on
shore
together
on
my
side
the
*NL*
island
,
and
the
people
who
belonged
to
them
all
landed
and
out
of
my
*NL*
sight
.
The
number
of
them
broke
all
my
measures
;
for
seeing
so
many
,
and
*NL*
knowing
that
they
always
came
four
or
six
,
or
sometimes
more
in
a
boat
,
I
*NL*
could
not
tell
what
to
think
of
it
,
or
how
to
take
my
measures
to
attack
*NL*
twenty
or
thirty
men
single-handed
;
so
lay
still
in
my
castle
,
perplexed
*NL*
and
discomforted
.
However
,
I
put
myself
into
the
same
position
for
an
*NL*
attack
that
I
had
formerly
provided
,
and
was
just
ready
for
action
,
if
*NL*
anything
had
presented
.
Having
waited
a
good
while
,
listening
to
hear
if
*NL*
they
made
any
noise
,
at
length
,
being
very
impatient
,
I
set
my
guns
at
*NL*
the
foot
of
my
ladder
,
and
clambered
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
by
my
two
*NL*
stages
,
as
usual
;
standing
so
,
however
,
that
my
head
did
not
appear
above
*NL*
the
hill
,
so
that
they
could
not
perceive
me
by
any
means
.
Here
I
*NL*
observed
,
by
the
help
of
my
perspective
glass
,
that
they
were
no
less
*NL*
than
thirty
in
number
;
that
they
had
a
fire
kindled
,
and
that
they
had
*NL*
meat
dressed
.
How
they
had
cooked
it
I
knew
not
,
or
what
it
was
;
but
*NL*
they
were
all
dancing
,
in
I
know
not
how
many
barbarous
gestures
and
*NL*
figures
,
their
own
way
,
round
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
thus
looking
on
them
,
I
perceived
,
by
my
perspective
,
two
*NL*
miserable
wretches
dragged
from
the
boats
,
where
,
it
seems
,
they
were
*NL*
laid
by
,
and
were
now
brought
out
for
the
slaughter
.
I
perceived
one
of
*NL*
them
immediately
fall
;
being
knocked
down
,
I
suppose
,
with
a
club
or
*NL*
wooden
sword
,
for
that
was
their
way
;
and
two
or
three
others
were
at
*NL*
work
immediately
,
cutting
him
open
for
their
cookery
,
while
the
other
*NL*
victim
was
left
standing
by
himself
,
till
they
should
be
ready
for
him
.
*NL*
In
that
very
moment
this
poor
wretch
,
seeing
himself
a
little
at
liberty
*NL*
and
unbound
,
Nature
inspired
him
with
hopes
of
life
,
and
he
started
away
*NL*
from
them
,
and
ran
with
incredible
swiftness
along
the
sands
,
directly
*NL*
towards
me
;
I
mean
towards
that
part
of
the
coast
where
my
habitation
*NL*
was
.
I
was
dreadfully
frightened
,
I
must
acknowledge
,
when
I
perceived
*NL*
him
run
my
way
;
and
especially
when
,
as
I
thought
,
I
saw
him
pursued
by
*NL*
the
whole
body
:
and
now
I
expected
that
part
of
my
dream
was
coming
to
*NL*
pass
,
and
that
he
would
certainly
take
shelter
in
my
grove
;
but
I
could
*NL*
not
depend
,
by
any
means
,
upon
my
dream
,
that
the
other
savages
would
not
*NL*
pursue
him
thither
and
find
him
there
.
However
,
I
kept
my
station
,
and
*NL*
my
spirits
began
to
recover
when
I
found
that
there
was
not
above
three
*NL*
men
that
followed
him
;
and
still
more
was
I
encouraged
,
when
I
found
that
*NL*
he
outstripped
them
exceedingly
in
running
,
and
gained
ground
on
them
;
so
*NL*
that
,
if
he
could
but
hold
out
for
half-an-hour
,
I
saw
easily
he
would
*NL*
fairly
get
away
from
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
between
them
and
my
castle
the
creek
,
which
I
mentioned
often
*NL*
in
the
first
part
of
my
story
,
where
I
landed
my
cargoes
out
of
the
ship
;
*NL*
and
this
I
saw
plainly
he
must
necessarily
swim
over
,
or
the
poor
wretch
*NL*
would
be
taken
there
;
but
when
the
savage
escaping
came
thither
,
he
made
*NL*
nothing
of
it
,
though
the
tide
was
then
up
;
but
plunging
in
,
swam
through
*NL*
in
about
thirty
strokes
,
or
thereabouts
,
landed
,
and
ran
with
exceeding
*NL*
strength
and
swiftness
.
When
the
three
persons
came
to
the
creek
,
I
*NL*
found
that
two
of
them
could
swim
,
but
the
third
could
not
,
and
that
,
*NL*
standing
on
the
other
side
,
he
looked
at
the
others
,
but
went
no
farther
,
*NL*
and
soon
after
went
softly
back
again
;
which
,
as
it
happened
,
was
very
*NL*
well
for
him
in
the
end
.
I
observed
that
the
two
who
swam
were
yet
more
*NL*
than
twice
as
strong
swimming
over
the
creek
as
the
fellow
was
that
fled
*NL*
from
them
.
It
came
very
warmly
upon
my
thoughts
,
and
indeed
*NL*
irresistibly
,
that
now
was
the
time
to
get
me
a
servant
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
*NL*
companion
or
assistant
;
and
that
I
was
plainly
called
by
Providence
to
*NL*
save
this
poor
creature
's
life
.
I
immediately
ran
down
the
ladders
with
*NL*
all
possible
expedition
,
fetched
my
two
guns
,
for
they
were
both
at
the
*NL*
foot
of
the
ladders
,
as
I
observed
before
,
and
getting
up
again
with
the
*NL*
same
haste
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
I
crossed
towards
the
sea
;
and
having
*NL*
a
very
short
cut
,
and
all
down
hill
,
placed
myself
in
the
way
between
the
*NL*
pursuers
and
the
pursued
,
hallowing
aloud
to
him
that
fled
,
who
,
looking
*NL*
back
,
was
at
first
perhaps
as
much
frightened
at
me
as
at
them
;
but
I
*NL*
beckoned
with
my
hand
to
him
to
come
back
;
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
I
slowly
*NL*
advanced
towards
the
two
that
followed
;
then
rushing
at
once
upon
the
*NL*
foremost
,
I
knocked
him
down
with
the
stock
of
my
piece
.
I
was
loath
to
*NL*
fire
,
because
I
would
not
have
the
rest
hear
;
though
,
at
that
distance
,
*NL*
it
would
not
have
been
easily
heard
,
and
being
out
of
sight
of
the
smoke
,
*NL*
too
,
they
would
not
have
known
what
to
make
of
it
.
Having
knocked
this
*NL*
fellow
down
,
the
other
who
pursued
him
stopped
,
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
frightened
,
and
I
advanced
towards
him
:
but
as
I
came
nearer
,
I
perceived
*NL*
presently
he
had
a
bow
and
arrow
,
and
was
fitting
it
to
shoot
at
me
:
so
I
*NL*
was
then
obliged
to
shoot
at
him
first
,
which
I
did
,
and
killed
him
at
*NL*
the
first
shot
.
The
poor
savage
who
fled
,
but
had
stopped
,
though
he
saw
*NL*
both
his
enemies
fallen
and
killed
,
as
he
thought
,
yet
was
so
frightened
*NL*
with
the
fire
and
noise
of
my
piece
that
he
stood
stock
still
,
and
*NL*
neither
came
forward
nor
went
backward
,
though
he
seemed
rather
inclined
*NL*
still
to
fly
than
to
come
on
.
I
hallooed
again
to
him
,
and
made
signs
to
*NL*
come
forward
,
which
he
easily
understood
,
and
came
a
little
way
;
then
*NL*
stopped
again
,
and
then
a
little
farther
,
and
stopped
again
;
and
I
could
*NL*
then
perceive
that
he
stood
trembling
,
as
if
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
,
*NL*
and
had
just
been
to
be
killed
,
as
his
two
enemies
were
.
I
beckoned
to
*NL*
him
again
to
come
to
me
,
and
gave
him
all
the
signs
of
encouragement
that
*NL*
I
could
think
of
;
and
he
came
nearer
and
nearer
,
kneeling
down
every
ten
*NL*
or
twelve
steps
,
in
token
of
acknowledgment
for
saving
his
life
.
I
*NL*
smiled
at
him
,
and
looked
pleasantly
,
and
beckoned
to
him
to
come
still
*NL*
nearer
;
at
length
he
came
close
to
me
;
and
then
he
kneeled
down
again
,
*NL*
kissed
the
ground
,
and
laid
his
head
upon
the
ground
,
and
taking
me
by
*NL*
the
foot
,
set
my
foot
upon
his
head
;
this
,
it
seems
,
was
in
token
of
*NL*
swearing
to
be
my
slave
for
ever
.
I
took
him
up
and
made
much
of
him
,
*NL*
and
encouraged
him
all
I
could
.
But
there
was
more
work
to
do
yet
;
for
I
*NL*
perceived
the
savage
whom
I
had
knocked
down
was
not
killed
,
but
stunned
*NL*
with
the
blow
,
and
began
to
come
to
himself
:
so
I
pointed
to
him
,
and
*NL*
showed
him
the
savage
,
that
he
was
not
dead
;
upon
this
he
spoke
some
*NL*
words
to
me
,
and
though
I
could
not
understand
them
,
yet
I
thought
they
*NL*
were
pleasant
to
hear
;
for
they
were
the
first
sound
of
a
man
's
voice
*NL*
that
I
had
heard
,
my
own
excepted
,
for
above
twenty-five
years
.
But
*NL*
there
was
no
time
for
such
reflections
now
;
the
savage
who
was
knocked
*NL*
down
recovered
himself
so
far
as
to
sit
up
upon
the
ground
,
and
I
*NL*
perceived
that
my
savage
began
to
be
afraid
;
but
when
I
saw
that
,
I
*NL*
presented
my
other
piece
at
the
man
,
as
if
I
would
shoot
him
:
upon
this
*NL*
my
savage
,
for
so
I
call
him
now
,
made
a
motion
to
me
to
lend
him
my
*NL*
sword
,
which
hung
naked
in
a
belt
by
my
side
,
which
I
did
.
He
no
sooner
*NL*
had
it
,
but
he
runs
to
his
enemy
,
and
at
one
blow
cut
off
his
head
so
*NL*
cleverly
,
no
executioner
in
Germany
could
have
done
it
sooner
or
better
;
*NL*
which
I
thought
very
strange
for
one
who
,
I
had
reason
to
believe
,
never
*NL*
saw
a
sword
in
his
life
before
,
except
their
own
wooden
swords
:
however
,
*NL*
it
seems
,
as
I
learned
afterwards
,
they
make
their
wooden
swords
so
*NL*
sharp
,
so
heavy
,
and
the
wood
is
so
hard
,
that
they
will
even
cut
off
*NL*
heads
with
them
,
ay
,
and
arms
,
and
that
at
one
blow
,
too
.
When
he
had
*NL*
done
this
,
he
comes
laughing
to
me
in
sign
of
triumph
,
and
brought
me
the
*NL*
sword
again
,
and
with
abundance
of
gestures
which
I
did
not
understand
,
*NL*
laid
it
down
,
with
the
head
of
the
savage
that
he
had
killed
,
just
before
*NL*
me
.
But
that
which
astonished
him
most
was
to
know
how
I
killed
the
*NL*
other
Indian
so
far
off
;
so
,
pointing
to
him
,
he
made
signs
to
me
to
let
*NL*
him
go
to
him
;
and
I
bade
him
go
,
as
well
as
I
could
.
When
he
came
to
*NL*
him
,
he
stood
like
one
amazed
,
looking
at
him
,
turning
him
first
on
one
*NL*
side
,
then
on
the
other
;
looked
at
the
wound
the
bullet
had
made
,
which
*NL*
it
seems
was
just
in
his
breast
,
where
it
had
made
a
hole
,
and
no
great
*NL*
quantity
of
blood
had
followed
;
but
he
had
bled
inwardly
,
for
he
was
*NL*
quite
dead
.
He
took
up
his
bow
and
arrows
,
and
came
back
;
so
I
turned
to
*NL*
go
away
,
and
beckoned
him
to
follow
me
,
making
signs
to
him
that
more
*NL*
might
come
after
them
.
Upon
this
he
made
signs
to
me
that
he
should
bury
*NL*
them
with
sand
,
that
they
might
not
be
seen
by
the
rest
,
if
they
*NL*
followed
;
and
so
I
made
signs
to
him
again
to
do
so
.
He
fell
to
work
;
*NL*
and
in
an
instant
he
had
scraped
a
hole
in
the
sand
with
his
hands
big
*NL*
enough
to
bury
the
first
in
,
and
then
dragged
him
into
it
,
and
covered
*NL*
him
;
and
did
so
by
the
other
also
;
I
believe
he
had
him
buried
them
both
*NL*
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
Then
,
calling
away
,
I
carried
him
,
not
to
my
*NL*
castle
,
but
quite
away
to
my
cave
,
on
the
farther
part
of
the
island
:
so
*NL*
I
did
not
let
my
dream
come
to
pass
in
that
part
,
that
he
came
into
my
*NL*
grove
for
shelter
.
Here
I
gave
him
bread
and
a
bunch
of
raisins
to
eat
,
*NL*
and
a
draught
of
water
,
which
I
found
he
was
indeed
in
great
distress
*NL*
for
,
from
his
running
:
and
having
refreshed
him
,
I
made
signs
for
him
to
*NL*
go
and
lie
down
to
sleep
,
showing
him
a
place
where
I
had
laid
some
*NL*
rice-straw
,
and
a
blanket
upon
it
,
which
I
used
to
sleep
upon
myself
*NL*
sometimes
;
so
the
poor
creature
lay
down
,
and
went
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
comely
,
handsome
fellow
,
perfectly
well
made
,
with
straight
,
*NL*
strong
limbs
,
not
too
large
;
tall
,
and
well-shaped
;
and
,
as
I
reckon
,
*NL*
about
twenty-six
years
of
age
.
He
had
a
very
good
countenance
,
not
a
*NL*
fierce
and
surly
aspect
,
but
seemed
to
have
something
very
manly
in
his
*NL*
face
;
and
yet
he
had
all
the
sweetness
and
softness
of
a
European
in
his
*NL*
countenance
,
too
,
especially
when
he
smiled
.
His
hair
was
long
and
*NL*
black
,
not
curled
like
wool
;
his
forehead
very
high
and
large
;
and
a
*NL*
great
vivacity
and
sparkling
sharpness
in
his
eyes
.
The
colour
of
his
*NL*
skin
was
not
quite
black
,
but
very
tawny
;
and
yet
not
an
ugly
,
yellow
,
*NL*
nauseous
tawny
,
as
the
Brazilians
and
Virginians
,
and
other
natives
of
*NL*
America
are
,
but
of
a
bright
kind
of
a
dun
olive-colour
,
that
had
in
it
*NL*
something
very
agreeable
,
though
not
very
easy
to
describe
.
His
face
was
*NL*
round
and
plump
;
his
nose
small
,
not
flat
,
like
the
negroes
;
a
very
good
*NL*
mouth
,
thin
lips
,
and
his
fine
teeth
well
set
,
and
as
white
as
ivory
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
slumbered
,
rather
than
slept
,
about
half-an-hour
,
he
awoke
*NL*
again
,
and
came
out
of
the
cave
to
me
:
for
I
had
been
milking
my
goats
*NL*
which
I
had
in
the
enclosure
just
by
:
when
he
espied
me
he
came
running
*NL*
to
me
,
laying
himself
down
again
upon
the
ground
,
with
all
the
possible
*NL*
signs
of
an
humble
,
thankful
disposition
,
making
a
great
many
antic
*NL*
gestures
to
show
it
.
At
last
he
lays
his
head
flat
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
close
to
my
foot
,
and
sets
my
other
foot
upon
his
head
,
as
he
had
done
*NL*
before
;
and
after
this
made
all
the
signs
to
me
of
subjection
,
servitude
,
*NL*
and
submission
imaginable
,
to
let
me
know
how
he
would
serve
me
so
long
*NL*
as
he
lived
.
I
understood
him
in
many
things
,
and
let
him
know
I
was
*NL*
very
well
pleased
with
him
.
In
a
little
time
I
began
to
speak
to
him
;
*NL*
and
teach
him
to
speak
to
me
:
and
first
,
I
let
him
know
his
name
should
*NL*
be
Friday
,
which
was
the
day
I
saved
his
life
:
I
called
him
so
for
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
time
.
I
likewise
taught
him
to
say
Master
;
and
then
let
*NL*
him
know
that
was
to
be
my
name
:
I
likewise
taught
him
to
say
Yes
and
No
*NL*
and
to
know
the
meaning
of
them
.
I
gave
him
some
milk
in
an
earthen
pot
,
*NL*
and
let
him
see
me
drink
it
before
him
,
and
sop
my
bread
in
it
;
and
gave
*NL*
him
a
cake
of
bread
to
do
the
like
,
which
he
quickly
complied
with
,
and
*NL*
made
signs
that
it
was
very
good
for
him
.
I
kept
there
with
him
all
that
*NL*
night
;
but
as
soon
as
it
was
day
I
beckoned
to
him
to
come
with
me
,
and
*NL*
let
him
know
I
would
give
him
some
clothes
;
at
which
he
seemed
very
glad
,
*NL*
for
he
was
stark
naked
.
As
we
went
by
the
place
where
he
had
buried
the
*NL*
two
men
,
he
pointed
exactly
to
the
place
,
and
showed
me
the
marks
that
he
*NL*
had
made
to
find
them
again
,
making
signs
to
me
that
we
should
dig
them
*NL*
up
again
and
eat
them
.
At
this
I
appeared
very
angry
,
expressed
my
*NL*
abhorrence
of
it
,
made
as
if
I
would
vomit
at
the
thoughts
of
it
,
and
*NL*
beckoned
with
my
hand
to
him
to
come
away
,
which
he
did
immediately
,
with
*NL*
great
submission
.
I
then
led
him
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
to
see
if
*NL*
his
enemies
were
gone
;
and
pulling
out
my
glass
I
looked
,
and
saw
plainly
*NL*
the
place
where
they
had
been
,
but
no
appearance
of
them
or
their
canoes
;
*NL*
so
that
it
was
plain
they
were
gone
,
and
had
left
their
two
comrades
*NL*
behind
them
,
without
any
search
after
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
not
content
with
this
discovery
;
but
having
now
more
courage
,
*NL*
and
consequently
more
curiosity
,
I
took
my
man
Friday
with
me
,
giving
him
*NL*
the
sword
in
his
hand
,
with
the
bow
and
arrows
at
his
back
,
which
I
found
*NL*
he
could
use
very
dexterously
,
making
him
carry
one
gun
for
me
,
and
I
two
*NL*
for
myself
;
and
away
we
marched
to
the
place
where
these
creatures
had
*NL*
been
;
for
I
had
a
mind
now
to
get
some
further
intelligence
of
them
.
*NL*
When
I
came
to
the
place
my
very
blood
ran
chill
in
my
veins
,
and
my
*NL*
heart
sunk
within
me
,
at
the
horror
of
the
spectacle
;
indeed
,
it
was
a
*NL*
dreadful
sight
,
at
least
it
was
so
to
me
,
though
Friday
made
nothing
of
*NL*
it
.
The
place
was
covered
with
human
bones
,
the
ground
dyed
with
their
*NL*
blood
,
and
great
pieces
of
flesh
left
here
and
there
,
half-eaten
,
*NL*
mangled
,
and
scorched
;
and
,
in
short
,
all
the
tokens
of
the
triumphant
*NL*
feast
they
had
been
making
there
,
after
a
victory
over
their
enemies
.
I
*NL*
saw
three
skulls
,
five
hands
,
and
the
bones
of
three
or
four
legs
and
*NL*
feet
,
and
abundance
of
other
parts
of
the
bodies
;
and
Friday
,
by
his
*NL*
signs
,
made
me
understand
that
they
brought
over
four
prisoners
to
feast
*NL*
upon
;
that
three
of
them
were
eaten
up
,
and
that
he
,
pointing
to
himself
,
*NL*
was
the
fourth
;
that
there
had
been
a
great
battle
between
them
and
their
*NL*
next
king
,
of
whose
subjects
,
it
seems
,
he
had
been
one
,
and
that
they
*NL*
had
taken
a
great
number
of
prisoners
;
all
which
were
carried
to
several
*NL*
places
by
those
who
had
taken
them
in
the
fight
,
in
order
to
feast
upon
*NL*
them
,
as
was
done
here
by
these
wretches
upon
those
they
brought
hither
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
caused
Friday
to
gather
all
the
skulls
,
bones
,
flesh
,
and
whatever
*NL*
remained
,
and
lay
them
together
in
a
heap
,
and
make
a
great
fire
upon
it
,
*NL*
and
burn
them
all
to
ashes
.
I
found
Friday
had
still
a
hankering
stomach
*NL*
after
some
of
the
flesh
,
and
was
still
a
cannibal
in
his
nature
;
but
I
*NL*
showed
so
much
abhorrence
at
the
very
thoughts
of
it
,
and
at
the
least
*NL*
appearance
of
it
,
that
he
durst
not
discover
it
:
for
I
had
,
by
some
*NL*
means
,
let
him
know
that
I
would
kill
him
if
he
offered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
done
this
,
we
came
back
to
our
castle
;
and
there
I
fell
to
*NL*
work
for
my
man
Friday
;
and
first
of
all
,
I
gave
him
a
pair
of
linen
*NL*
drawers
,
which
I
had
out
of
the
poor
gunner
's
chest
I
mentioned
,
which
I
*NL*
found
in
the
wreck
,
and
which
,
with
a
little
alteration
,
fitted
him
very
*NL*
well
;
and
then
I
made
him
a
jerkin
of
goat
's
skin
,
as
well
as
my
skill
*NL*
would
allow
-LRB-
for
I
was
now
grown
a
tolerably
good
tailor
-RRB-
;
and
I
gave
him
*NL*
a
cap
which
I
made
of
hare
's
skin
,
very
convenient
,
and
fashionable
*NL*
enough
;
and
thus
he
was
clothed
,
for
the
present
,
tolerably
well
,
and
was
*NL*
mighty
well
pleased
to
see
himself
almost
as
well
clothed
as
his
master
.
*NL*
It
is
true
he
went
awkwardly
in
these
clothes
at
first
:
wearing
the
*NL*
drawers
was
very
awkward
to
him
,
and
the
sleeves
of
the
waistcoat
galled
*NL*
his
shoulders
and
the
inside
of
his
arms
;
but
a
little
easing
them
where
*NL*
he
complained
they
hurt
him
,
and
using
himself
to
them
,
he
took
to
them
*NL*
at
length
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
after
I
came
home
to
my
hutch
with
him
,
I
began
to
consider
*NL*
where
I
should
lodge
him
:
and
that
I
might
do
well
for
him
and
yet
be
*NL*
perfectly
easy
myself
,
I
made
a
little
tent
for
him
in
the
vacant
place
*NL*
between
my
two
fortifications
,
in
the
inside
of
the
last
,
and
in
the
*NL*
outside
of
the
first
.
As
there
was
a
door
or
entrance
there
into
my
*NL*
cave
,
I
made
a
formal
framed
door-case
,
and
a
door
to
it
,
of
boards
,
and
*NL*
set
it
up
in
the
passage
,
a
little
within
the
entrance
;
and
,
causing
the
*NL*
door
to
open
in
the
inside
,
I
barred
it
up
in
the
night
,
taking
in
my
*NL*
ladders
,
too
;
so
that
Friday
could
no
way
come
at
me
in
the
inside
of
my
*NL*
innermost
wall
,
without
making
so
much
noise
in
getting
over
that
it
must
*NL*
needs
awaken
me
;
for
my
first
wall
had
now
a
complete
roof
over
it
of
*NL*
long
poles
,
covering
all
my
tent
,
and
leaning
up
to
the
side
of
the
hill
;
*NL*
which
was
again
laid
across
with
smaller
sticks
,
instead
of
laths
,
and
*NL*
then
thatched
over
a
great
thickness
with
the
rice-straw
,
which
was
*NL*
strong
,
like
reeds
;
and
at
the
hole
or
place
which
was
left
to
go
in
or
*NL*
out
by
the
ladder
I
had
placed
a
kind
of
trap-door
,
which
,
if
it
had
been
*NL*
attempted
on
the
outside
,
would
not
have
opened
at
all
,
but
would
have
*NL*
fallen
down
and
made
a
great
noise
--
as
to
weapons
,
I
took
them
all
into
*NL*
my
side
every
night
.
But
I
needed
none
of
all
this
precaution
;
for
never
*NL*
man
had
a
more
faithful
,
loving
,
sincere
servant
than
Friday
was
to
me
:
*NL*
without
passions
,
sullenness
,
or
designs
,
perfectly
obliged
and
engaged
;
*NL*
his
very
affections
were
tied
to
me
,
like
those
of
a
child
to
a
father
;
*NL*
and
I
daresay
he
would
have
sacrificed
his
life
to
save
mine
upon
any
*NL*
occasion
whatsoever
--
the
many
testimonies
he
gave
me
of
this
put
it
out
*NL*
of
doubt
,
and
soon
convinced
me
that
I
needed
to
use
no
precautions
for
*NL*
my
safety
on
his
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
frequently
gave
me
occasion
to
observe
,
and
that
with
wonder
,
that
*NL*
however
it
had
pleased
God
in
His
providence
,
and
in
the
government
of
*NL*
the
works
of
His
hands
,
to
take
from
so
great
a
part
of
the
world
of
His
*NL*
creatures
the
best
uses
to
which
their
faculties
and
the
powers
of
their
*NL*
souls
are
adapted
,
yet
that
He
has
bestowed
upon
them
the
same
powers
,
*NL*
the
same
reason
,
the
same
affections
,
the
same
sentiments
of
kindness
and
*NL*
obligation
,
the
same
passions
and
resentments
of
wrongs
,
the
same
sense
*NL*
of
gratitude
,
sincerity
,
fidelity
,
and
all
the
capacities
of
doing
good
*NL*
and
receiving
good
that
He
has
given
to
us
;
and
that
when
He
pleases
to
*NL*
offer
them
occasions
of
exerting
these
,
they
are
as
ready
,
nay
,
more
*NL*
ready
,
to
apply
them
to
the
right
uses
for
which
they
were
bestowed
than
*NL*
we
are
.
This
made
me
very
melancholy
sometimes
,
in
reflecting
,
as
the
*NL*
several
occasions
presented
,
how
mean
a
use
we
make
of
all
these
,
even
*NL*
though
we
have
these
powers
enlightened
by
the
great
lamp
of
instruction
,
*NL*
the
Spirit
of
God
,
and
by
the
knowledge
of
His
word
added
to
our
*NL*
understanding
;
and
why
it
has
pleased
God
to
hide
the
like
saving
*NL*
knowledge
from
so
many
millions
of
souls
,
who
,
if
I
might
judge
by
this
*NL*
poor
savage
,
would
make
a
much
better
use
of
it
than
we
did
.
From
hence
*NL*
I
sometimes
was
led
too
far
,
to
invade
the
sovereignty
of
Providence
,
*NL*
and
,
as
it
were
,
arraign
the
justice
of
so
arbitrary
a
disposition
of
*NL*
things
,
that
should
hide
that
sight
from
some
,
and
reveal
it
to
others
,
*NL*
and
yet
expect
a
like
duty
from
both
;
but
I
shut
it
up
,
and
checked
my
*NL*
thoughts
with
this
conclusion
:
first
,
that
we
did
not
know
by
what
light
*NL*
and
law
these
should
be
condemned
;
but
that
as
God
was
necessarily
,
and
*NL*
by
the
nature
of
His
being
,
infinitely
holy
and
just
,
so
it
could
not
be
,
*NL*
but
if
these
creatures
were
all
sentenced
to
absence
from
Himself
,
it
was
*NL*
on
account
of
sinning
against
that
light
which
,
as
the
Scripture
says
,
*NL*
was
a
law
to
themselves
,
and
by
such
rules
as
their
consciences
would
*NL*
acknowledge
to
be
just
,
though
the
foundation
was
not
discovered
to
us
;
*NL*
and
secondly
,
that
still
as
we
all
are
the
clay
in
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
potter
,
no
vessel
could
say
to
him
,
``
Why
hast
thou
formed
me
thus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
my
new
companion
.
I
was
greatly
delighted
with
him
,
and
*NL*
made
it
my
business
to
teach
him
everything
that
was
proper
to
make
him
*NL*
useful
,
handy
,
and
helpful
;
but
especially
to
make
him
speak
,
and
*NL*
understand
me
when
I
spoke
;
and
he
was
the
aptest
scholar
that
ever
was
;
*NL*
and
particularly
was
so
merry
,
so
constantly
diligent
,
and
so
pleased
*NL*
when
he
could
but
understand
me
,
or
make
me
understand
him
,
that
it
was
*NL*
very
pleasant
for
me
to
talk
to
him
.
Now
my
life
began
to
be
so
easy
*NL*
that
I
began
to
say
to
myself
that
could
I
but
have
been
safe
from
more
*NL*
savages
,
I
cared
not
if
I
was
never
to
remove
from
the
place
where
I
*NL*
lived
.

CHAPTER
XV
--
FRIDAY
'S
EDUCATION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
been
two
or
three
days
returned
to
my
castle
,
I
thought
that
,
*NL*
in
order
to
bring
Friday
off
from
his
horrid
way
of
feeding
,
and
from
the
*NL*
relish
of
a
cannibal
's
stomach
,
I
ought
to
let
him
taste
other
flesh
;
so
*NL*
I
took
him
out
with
me
one
morning
to
the
woods
.
I
went
,
indeed
,
*NL*
intending
to
kill
a
kid
out
of
my
own
flock
;
and
bring
it
home
and
dress
*NL*
it
;
but
as
I
was
going
I
saw
a
she-goat
lying
down
in
the
shade
,
and
two
*NL*
young
kids
sitting
by
her
.
I
catched
hold
of
Friday
.
``
Hold
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
``
stand
still
;
''
and
made
signs
to
him
not
to
stir
:
immediately
I
presented
*NL*
my
piece
,
shot
,
and
killed
one
of
the
kids
.
The
poor
creature
,
who
had
*NL*
at
a
distance
,
indeed
,
seen
me
kill
the
savage
,
his
enemy
,
but
did
not
*NL*
know
,
nor
could
imagine
how
it
was
done
,
was
sensibly
surprised
,
*NL*
trembled
,
and
shook
,
and
looked
so
amazed
that
I
thought
he
would
have
*NL*
sunk
down
.
He
did
not
see
the
kid
I
shot
at
,
or
perceive
I
had
killed
*NL*
it
,
but
ripped
up
his
waistcoat
to
feel
whether
he
was
not
wounded
;
and
,
*NL*
as
I
found
presently
,
thought
I
was
resolved
to
kill
him
:
for
he
came
and
*NL*
kneeled
down
to
me
,
and
embracing
my
knees
,
said
a
great
many
things
I
*NL*
did
not
understand
;
but
I
could
easily
see
the
meaning
was
to
pray
me
not
*NL*
to
kill
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
found
a
way
to
convince
him
that
I
would
do
him
no
harm
;
and
*NL*
taking
him
up
by
the
hand
,
laughed
at
him
,
and
pointing
to
the
kid
which
*NL*
I
had
killed
,
beckoned
to
him
to
run
and
fetch
it
,
which
he
did
:
and
*NL*
while
he
was
wondering
,
and
looking
to
see
how
the
creature
was
killed
,
I
*NL*
loaded
my
gun
again
.
By-and-by
I
saw
a
great
fowl
,
like
a
hawk
,
sitting
*NL*
upon
a
tree
within
shot
;
so
,
to
let
Friday
understand
a
little
what
I
*NL*
would
do
,
I
called
him
to
me
again
,
pointed
at
the
fowl
,
which
was
indeed
*NL*
a
parrot
,
though
I
thought
it
had
been
a
hawk
;
I
say
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
parrot
,
and
to
my
gun
,
and
to
the
ground
under
the
parrot
,
to
let
him
see
*NL*
I
would
make
it
fall
,
I
made
him
understand
that
I
would
shoot
and
kill
*NL*
that
bird
;
accordingly
,
I
fired
,
and
bade
him
look
,
and
immediately
he
*NL*
saw
the
parrot
fall
.
He
stood
like
one
frightened
again
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
all
I
had
said
to
him
;
and
I
found
he
was
the
more
amazed
,
because
he
did
*NL*
not
see
me
put
anything
into
the
gun
,
but
thought
that
there
must
be
some
*NL*
wonderful
fund
of
death
and
destruction
in
that
thing
,
able
to
kill
man
,
*NL*
beast
,
bird
,
or
anything
near
or
far
off
;
and
the
astonishment
this
*NL*
created
in
him
was
such
as
could
not
wear
off
for
a
long
time
;
and
I
*NL*
believe
,
if
I
would
have
let
him
,
he
would
have
worshipped
me
and
my
gun
.
*NL*
As
for
the
gun
itself
,
he
would
not
so
much
as
touch
it
for
several
days
*NL*
after
;
but
he
would
speak
to
it
and
talk
to
it
,
as
if
it
had
answered
*NL*
him
,
when
he
was
by
himself
;
which
,
as
I
afterwards
learned
of
him
,
was
*NL*
to
desire
it
not
to
kill
him
.
Well
,
after
his
astonishment
was
a
little
*NL*
over
at
this
,
I
pointed
to
him
to
run
and
fetch
the
bird
I
had
shot
,
*NL*
which
he
did
,
but
stayed
some
time
;
for
the
parrot
,
not
being
quite
dead
,
*NL*
had
fluttered
away
a
good
distance
from
the
place
where
she
fell
:
*NL*
however
,
he
found
her
,
took
her
up
,
and
brought
her
to
me
;
and
as
I
had
*NL*
perceived
his
ignorance
about
the
gun
before
,
I
took
this
advantage
to
*NL*
charge
the
gun
again
,
and
not
to
let
him
see
me
do
it
,
that
I
might
be
*NL*
ready
for
any
other
mark
that
might
present
;
but
nothing
more
offered
at
*NL*
that
time
:
so
I
brought
home
the
kid
,
and
the
same
evening
I
took
the
*NL*
skin
off
,
and
cut
it
out
as
well
as
I
could
;
and
having
a
pot
fit
for
*NL*
that
purpose
,
I
boiled
or
stewed
some
of
the
flesh
,
and
made
some
very
*NL*
good
broth
.
After
I
had
begun
to
eat
some
I
gave
some
to
my
man
,
who
*NL*
seemed
very
glad
of
it
,
and
liked
it
very
well
;
but
that
which
was
*NL*
strangest
to
him
was
to
see
me
eat
salt
with
it
.
He
made
a
sign
to
me
*NL*
that
the
salt
was
not
good
to
eat
;
and
putting
a
little
into
his
own
*NL*
mouth
,
he
seemed
to
nauseate
it
,
and
would
spit
and
sputter
at
it
,
*NL*
washing
his
mouth
with
fresh
water
after
it
:
on
the
other
hand
,
I
took
*NL*
some
meat
into
my
mouth
without
salt
,
and
I
pretended
to
spit
and
sputter
*NL*
for
want
of
salt
,
as
much
as
he
had
done
at
the
salt
;
but
it
would
not
*NL*
do
;
he
would
never
care
for
salt
with
meat
or
in
his
broth
;
at
least
,
not
*NL*
for
a
great
while
,
and
then
but
a
very
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
fed
him
with
boiled
meat
and
broth
,
I
was
resolved
to
feast
*NL*
him
the
next
day
by
roasting
a
piece
of
the
kid
:
this
I
did
by
hanging
it
*NL*
before
the
fire
on
a
string
,
as
I
had
seen
many
people
do
in
England
,
*NL*
setting
two
poles
up
,
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
,
and
one
across
the
*NL*
top
,
and
tying
the
string
to
the
cross
stick
,
letting
the
meat
turn
*NL*
continually
.
This
Friday
admired
very
much
;
but
when
he
came
to
taste
*NL*
the
flesh
,
he
took
so
many
ways
to
tell
me
how
well
he
liked
it
,
that
I
*NL*
could
not
but
understand
him
:
and
at
last
he
told
me
,
as
well
as
he
*NL*
could
,
he
would
never
eat
man
's
flesh
any
more
,
which
I
was
very
glad
to
*NL*
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
I
set
him
to
work
beating
some
corn
out
,
and
sifting
it
in
*NL*
the
manner
I
used
to
do
,
as
I
observed
before
;
and
he
soon
understood
how
*NL*
to
do
it
as
well
as
I
,
especially
after
he
had
seen
what
the
meaning
of
*NL*
it
was
,
and
that
it
was
to
make
bread
of
;
for
after
that
I
let
him
see
me
*NL*
make
my
bread
,
and
bake
it
too
;
and
in
a
little
time
Friday
was
able
to
*NL*
do
all
the
work
for
me
as
well
as
I
could
do
it
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
now
to
consider
,
that
having
two
mouths
to
feed
instead
of
one
,
I
*NL*
must
provide
more
ground
for
my
harvest
,
and
plant
a
larger
quantity
of
*NL*
corn
than
I
used
to
do
;
so
I
marked
out
a
larger
piece
of
land
,
and
began
*NL*
the
fence
in
the
same
manner
as
before
,
in
which
Friday
worked
not
only
*NL*
very
willingly
and
very
hard
,
but
did
it
very
cheerfully
:
and
I
told
him
*NL*
what
it
was
for
;
that
it
was
for
corn
to
make
more
bread
,
because
he
was
*NL*
now
with
me
,
and
that
I
might
have
enough
for
him
and
myself
too
.
He
*NL*
appeared
very
sensible
of
that
part
,
and
let
me
know
that
he
thought
I
*NL*
had
much
more
labour
upon
me
on
his
account
than
I
had
for
myself
;
and
*NL*
that
he
would
work
the
harder
for
me
if
I
would
tell
him
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
pleasantest
year
of
all
the
life
I
led
in
this
place
.
*NL*
Friday
began
to
talk
pretty
well
,
and
understand
the
names
of
almost
*NL*
everything
I
had
occasion
to
call
for
,
and
of
every
place
I
had
to
send
*NL*
him
to
,
and
talked
a
great
deal
to
me
;
so
that
,
in
short
,
I
began
now
to
*NL*
have
some
use
for
my
tongue
again
,
which
,
indeed
,
I
had
very
little
*NL*
occasion
for
before
.
Besides
the
pleasure
of
talking
to
him
,
I
had
a
*NL*
singular
satisfaction
in
the
fellow
himself
:
his
simple
,
unfeigned
*NL*
honesty
appeared
to
me
more
and
more
every
day
,
and
I
began
really
to
*NL*
love
the
creature
;
and
on
his
side
I
believe
he
loved
me
more
than
it
was
*NL*
possible
for
him
ever
to
love
anything
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
mind
once
to
try
if
he
had
any
inclination
for
his
own
country
*NL*
again
;
and
having
taught
him
English
so
well
that
he
could
answer
me
*NL*
almost
any
question
,
I
asked
him
whether
the
nation
that
he
belonged
to
*NL*
never
conquered
in
battle
?
At
which
he
smiled
,
and
said
--
``
Yes
,
yes
,
we
*NL*
always
fight
the
better
;
''
that
is
,
he
meant
always
get
the
better
in
*NL*
fight
;
and
so
we
began
the
following
discourse
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
_
Master
_
.
--
You
always
fight
the
better
;
how
came
you
to
be
taken
*NL*
prisoner
,
then
,
Friday
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
Friday
_
.
--
My
nation
beat
much
for
all
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Master
_
.
--
How
beat
?
If
your
nation
beat
them
,
how
came
you
to
be
taken
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
Friday
_
.
--
They
more
many
than
my
nation
,
in
the
place
where
me
was
;
they
*NL*
take
one
,
two
,
three
,
and
me
:
my
nation
over-beat
them
in
the
yonder
*NL*
place
,
where
me
no
was
;
there
my
nation
take
one
,
two
,
great
thousand
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Master
_
.
--
But
why
did
not
your
side
recover
you
from
the
hands
of
your
*NL*
enemies
,
then
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
Friday
_
.
--
They
run
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
and
me
,
and
make
go
in
the
canoe
;
*NL*
my
nation
have
no
canoe
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Master
_
.
--
Well
,
Friday
,
and
what
does
your
nation
do
with
the
men
they
*NL*
take
?
Do
they
carry
them
away
and
eat
them
,
as
these
did
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
Friday
_
.
--
Yes
,
my
nation
eat
mans
too
;
eat
all
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Master
_
.
--
Where
do
they
carry
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
Friday
_
.
--
Go
to
other
place
,
where
they
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Master
_
.
--
Do
they
come
hither
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
Friday
_
.
--
Yes
,
yes
,
they
come
hither
;
come
other
else
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Master
_
.
--
Have
you
been
here
with
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
Friday
_
.
--
Yes
,
I
have
been
here
-LRB-
points
to
the
NW
.
side
of
the
island
,
*NL*
which
,
it
seems
,
was
their
side
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
I
understood
that
my
man
Friday
had
formerly
been
among
the
*NL*
savages
who
used
to
come
on
shore
on
the
farther
part
of
the
island
,
on
*NL*
the
same
man-eating
occasions
he
was
now
brought
for
;
and
some
time
*NL*
after
,
when
I
took
the
courage
to
carry
him
to
that
side
,
being
the
same
*NL*
I
formerly
mentioned
,
he
presently
knew
the
place
,
and
told
me
he
was
*NL*
there
once
,
when
they
ate
up
twenty
men
,
two
women
,
and
one
child
;
he
*NL*
could
not
tell
twenty
in
English
,
but
he
numbered
them
by
laying
so
many
*NL*
stones
in
a
row
,
and
pointing
to
me
to
tell
them
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
told
this
passage
,
because
it
introduces
what
follows
:
that
after
*NL*
this
discourse
I
had
with
him
,
I
asked
him
how
far
it
was
from
our
island
*NL*
to
the
shore
,
and
whether
the
canoes
were
not
often
lost
.
He
told
me
*NL*
there
was
no
danger
,
no
canoes
ever
lost
:
but
that
after
a
little
way
out
*NL*
to
sea
,
there
was
a
current
and
wind
,
always
one
way
in
the
morning
,
the
*NL*
other
in
the
afternoon
.
This
I
understood
to
be
no
more
than
the
sets
of
*NL*
the
tide
,
as
going
out
or
coming
in
;
but
I
afterwards
understood
it
was
*NL*
occasioned
by
the
great
draft
and
reflux
of
the
mighty
river
Orinoco
,
in
*NL*
the
mouth
or
gulf
of
which
river
,
as
I
found
afterwards
,
our
island
lay
;
*NL*
and
that
this
land
,
which
I
perceived
to
be
W.
and
NW.
,
was
the
great
*NL*
island
Trinidad
,
on
the
north
point
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
.
I
asked
*NL*
Friday
a
thousand
questions
about
the
country
,
the
inhabitants
,
the
sea
,
*NL*
the
coast
,
and
what
nations
were
near
;
he
told
me
all
he
knew
with
the
*NL*
greatest
openness
imaginable
.
I
asked
him
the
names
of
the
several
*NL*
nations
of
his
sort
of
people
,
but
could
get
no
other
name
than
Caribs
;
*NL*
from
whence
I
easily
understood
that
these
were
the
Caribbees
,
which
our
*NL*
maps
place
on
the
part
of
America
which
reaches
from
the
mouth
of
the
*NL*
river
Orinoco
to
Guiana
,
and
onwards
to
St.
Martha
.
He
told
me
that
up
a
*NL*
great
way
beyond
the
moon
,
that
was
beyond
the
setting
of
the
moon
,
which
*NL*
must
be
west
from
their
country
,
there
dwelt
white
bearded
men
,
like
me
,
*NL*
and
pointed
to
my
great
whiskers
,
which
I
mentioned
before
;
and
that
they
*NL*
had
killed
much
mans
,
that
was
his
word
:
by
all
which
I
understood
he
*NL*
meant
the
Spaniards
,
whose
cruelties
in
America
had
been
spread
over
the
*NL*
whole
country
,
and
were
remembered
by
all
the
nations
from
father
to
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
inquired
if
he
could
tell
me
how
I
might
go
from
this
island
,
and
get
*NL*
among
those
white
men
.
He
told
me
,
``
Yes
,
yes
,
you
may
go
in
two
canoe
.
''
*NL*
I
could
not
understand
what
he
meant
,
or
make
him
describe
to
me
what
he
*NL*
meant
by
two
canoe
,
till
at
last
,
with
great
difficulty
,
I
found
he
meant
*NL*
it
must
be
in
a
large
boat
,
as
big
as
two
canoes
.
This
part
of
Friday
's
*NL*
discourse
I
began
to
relish
very
well
;
and
from
this
time
I
entertained
*NL*
some
hopes
that
,
one
time
or
other
,
I
might
find
an
opportunity
to
make
*NL*
my
escape
from
this
place
,
and
that
this
poor
savage
might
be
a
means
to
*NL*
help
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
long
time
that
Friday
had
now
been
with
me
,
and
that
he
began
*NL*
to
speak
to
me
,
and
understand
me
,
I
was
not
wanting
to
lay
a
foundation
*NL*
of
religious
knowledge
in
his
mind
;
particularly
I
asked
him
one
time
,
*NL*
who
made
him
.
The
creature
did
not
understand
me
at
all
,
but
thought
I
*NL*
had
asked
who
was
his
father
--
but
I
took
it
up
by
another
handle
,
and
*NL*
asked
him
who
made
the
sea
,
the
ground
we
walked
on
,
and
the
hills
and
*NL*
woods
.
He
told
me
,
``
It
was
one
Benamuckee
,
that
lived
beyond
all
;
''
he
*NL*
could
describe
nothing
of
this
great
person
,
but
that
he
was
very
old
,
*NL*
``
much
older
,
''
he
said
,
``
than
the
sea
or
land
,
than
the
moon
or
the
*NL*
stars
.
''
I
asked
him
then
,
if
this
old
person
had
made
all
things
,
why
*NL*
did
not
all
things
worship
him
?
He
looked
very
grave
,
and
,
with
a
*NL*
perfect
look
of
innocence
,
said
,
``
All
things
say
O
to
him
.
''
I
asked
him
*NL*
if
the
people
who
die
in
his
country
went
away
anywhere
?
He
said
,
``
Yes
;
*NL*
they
all
went
to
Benamuckee
.
''
Then
I
asked
him
whether
those
they
eat
up
*NL*
went
thither
too
.
He
said
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
these
things
,
I
began
to
instruct
him
in
the
knowledge
of
the
true
*NL*
God
;
I
told
him
that
the
great
Maker
of
all
things
lived
up
there
,
*NL*
pointing
up
towards
heaven
;
that
He
governed
the
world
by
the
same
power
*NL*
and
providence
by
which
He
made
it
;
that
He
was
omnipotent
,
and
could
do
*NL*
everything
for
us
,
give
everything
to
us
,
take
everything
from
us
;
and
*NL*
thus
,
by
degrees
,
I
opened
his
eyes
.
He
listened
with
great
attention
,
*NL*
and
received
with
pleasure
the
notion
of
Jesus
Christ
being
sent
to
*NL*
redeem
us
;
and
of
the
manner
of
making
our
prayers
to
God
,
and
His
being
*NL*
able
to
hear
us
,
even
in
heaven
.
He
told
me
one
day
,
that
if
our
God
*NL*
could
hear
us
,
up
beyond
the
sun
,
he
must
needs
be
a
greater
God
than
*NL*
their
Benamuckee
,
who
lived
but
a
little
way
off
,
and
yet
could
not
hear
*NL*
till
they
went
up
to
the
great
mountains
where
he
dwelt
to
speak
to
them
.
*NL*
I
asked
him
if
ever
he
went
thither
to
speak
to
him
.
He
said
,
``
No
;
they
*NL*
never
went
that
were
young
men
;
none
went
thither
but
the
old
men
,
''
whom
*NL*
he
called
their
Oowokakee
;
that
is
,
as
I
made
him
explain
to
me
,
their
*NL*
religious
,
or
clergy
;
and
that
they
went
to
say
O
-LRB-
so
he
called
saying
*NL*
prayers
-RRB-
,
and
then
came
back
and
told
them
what
Benamuckee
said
.
By
this
*NL*
I
observed
,
that
there
is
priestcraft
even
among
the
most
blinded
,
*NL*
ignorant
pagans
in
the
world
;
and
the
policy
of
making
a
secret
of
*NL*
religion
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
veneration
of
the
people
to
the
*NL*
clergy
,
not
only
to
be
found
in
the
Roman
,
but
,
perhaps
,
among
all
*NL*
religions
in
the
world
,
even
among
the
most
brutish
and
barbarous
*NL*
savages
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
endeavoured
to
clear
up
this
fraud
to
my
man
Friday
;
and
told
him
that
*NL*
the
pretence
of
their
old
men
going
up
to
the
mountains
to
say
O
to
their
*NL*
god
Benamuckee
was
a
cheat
;
and
their
bringing
word
from
thence
what
he
*NL*
said
was
much
more
so
;
that
if
they
met
with
any
answer
,
or
spake
with
*NL*
any
one
there
,
it
must
be
with
an
evil
spirit
;
and
then
I
entered
into
a
*NL*
long
discourse
with
him
about
the
devil
,
the
origin
of
him
,
his
rebellion
*NL*
against
God
,
his
enmity
to
man
,
the
reason
of
it
,
his
setting
himself
up
*NL*
in
the
dark
parts
of
the
world
to
be
worshipped
instead
of
God
,
and
as
*NL*
God
,
and
the
many
stratagems
he
made
use
of
to
delude
mankind
to
their
*NL*
ruin
;
how
he
had
a
secret
access
to
our
passions
and
to
our
affections
,
*NL*
and
to
adapt
his
snares
to
our
inclinations
,
so
as
to
cause
us
even
to
be
*NL*
our
own
tempters
,
and
run
upon
our
destruction
by
our
own
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
it
was
not
so
easy
to
imprint
right
notions
in
his
mind
about
the
*NL*
devil
as
it
was
about
the
being
of
a
God
.
Nature
assisted
all
my
*NL*
arguments
to
evidence
to
him
even
the
necessity
of
a
great
First
Cause
,
*NL*
an
overruling
,
governing
Power
,
a
secret
directing
Providence
,
and
of
the
*NL*
equity
and
justice
of
paying
homage
to
Him
that
made
us
,
and
the
like
;
*NL*
but
there
appeared
nothing
of
this
kind
in
the
notion
of
an
evil
spirit
,
*NL*
of
his
origin
,
his
being
,
his
nature
,
and
above
all
,
of
his
inclination
*NL*
to
do
evil
,
and
to
draw
us
in
to
do
so
too
;
and
the
poor
creature
puzzled
*NL*
me
once
in
such
a
manner
,
by
a
question
merely
natural
and
innocent
,
that
*NL*
I
scarce
knew
what
to
say
to
him
.
I
had
been
talking
a
great
deal
to
him
*NL*
of
the
power
of
God
,
His
omnipotence
,
His
aversion
to
sin
,
His
being
a
*NL*
consuming
fire
to
the
workers
of
iniquity
;
how
,
as
He
had
made
us
all
,
He
*NL*
could
destroy
us
and
all
the
world
in
a
moment
;
and
he
listened
with
*NL*
great
seriousness
to
me
all
the
while
.
After
this
I
had
been
telling
him
*NL*
how
the
devil
was
God
's
enemy
in
the
hearts
of
men
,
and
used
all
his
*NL*
malice
and
skill
to
defeat
the
good
designs
of
Providence
,
and
to
ruin
*NL*
the
kingdom
of
Christ
in
the
world
,
and
the
like
.
``
Well
,
''
says
Friday
,
*NL*
``
but
you
say
God
is
so
strong
,
so
great
;
is
He
not
much
strong
,
much
*NL*
might
as
the
devil
?
''
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
says
I
,
``
Friday
;
God
is
stronger
than
*NL*
the
devil
--
God
is
above
the
devil
,
and
therefore
we
pray
to
God
to
tread
*NL*
him
down
under
our
feet
,
and
enable
us
to
resist
his
temptations
and
*NL*
quench
his
fiery
darts
.
''
``
But
,
''
says
he
again
,
``
if
God
much
stronger
,
*NL*
much
might
as
the
wicked
devil
,
why
God
no
kill
the
devil
,
so
make
him
no
*NL*
more
do
wicked
?
''
I
was
strangely
surprised
at
this
question
;
and
,
after
*NL*
all
,
though
I
was
now
an
old
man
,
yet
I
was
but
a
young
doctor
,
and
ill
*NL*
qualified
for
a
casuist
or
a
solver
of
difficulties
;
and
at
first
I
could
*NL*
not
tell
what
to
say
;
so
I
pretended
not
to
hear
him
,
and
asked
him
what
*NL*
he
said
;
but
he
was
too
earnest
for
an
answer
to
forget
his
question
,
so
*NL*
that
he
repeated
it
in
the
very
same
broken
words
as
above
.
By
this
time
*NL*
I
had
recovered
myself
a
little
,
and
I
said
,
``
God
will
at
last
punish
him
*NL*
severely
;
he
is
reserved
for
the
judgment
,
and
is
to
be
cast
into
the
*NL*
bottomless
pit
,
to
dwell
with
everlasting
fire
.
''
This
did
not
satisfy
*NL*
Friday
;
but
he
returns
upon
me
,
repeating
my
words
,
''
'
_
Reserve
at
last
_
!
'
*NL*
me
no
understand
--
but
why
not
kill
the
devil
now
;
not
kill
great
ago
?
''
*NL*
``
You
may
as
well
ask
me
,
''
said
I
,
``
why
God
does
not
kill
you
or
me
,
when
*NL*
we
do
wicked
things
here
that
offend
Him
--
we
are
preserved
to
repent
and
*NL*
be
pardoned
.
''
He
mused
some
time
on
this
.
``
Well
,
well
,
''
says
he
,
mighty
*NL*
affectionately
,
``
that
well
--
so
you
,
I
,
devil
,
all
wicked
,
all
preserve
,
*NL*
repent
,
God
pardon
all
.
''
Here
I
was
run
down
again
by
him
to
the
last
*NL*
degree
;
and
it
was
a
testimony
to
me
,
how
the
mere
notions
of
nature
,
*NL*
though
they
will
guide
reasonable
creatures
to
the
knowledge
of
a
God
,
*NL*
and
of
a
worship
or
homage
due
to
the
supreme
being
of
God
,
as
the
*NL*
consequence
of
our
nature
,
yet
nothing
but
divine
revelation
can
form
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
Jesus
Christ
,
and
of
redemption
purchased
for
us
;
of
a
*NL*
Mediator
of
the
new
covenant
,
and
of
an
Intercessor
at
the
footstool
of
*NL*
God
's
throne
;
I
say
,
nothing
but
a
revelation
from
Heaven
can
form
these
*NL*
in
the
soul
;
and
that
,
therefore
,
the
gospel
of
our
Lord
and
Saviour
*NL*
Jesus
Christ
,
I
mean
the
Word
of
God
,
and
the
Spirit
of
God
,
promised
for
*NL*
the
guide
and
sanctifier
of
His
people
,
are
the
absolutely
necessary
*NL*
instructors
of
the
souls
of
men
in
the
saving
knowledge
of
God
and
the
*NL*
means
of
salvation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
therefore
diverted
the
present
discourse
between
me
and
my
man
,
rising
*NL*
up
hastily
,
as
upon
some
sudden
occasion
of
going
out
;
then
sending
him
*NL*
for
something
a
good
way
off
,
I
seriously
prayed
to
God
that
He
would
*NL*
enable
me
to
instruct
savingly
this
poor
savage
;
assisting
,
by
His
*NL*
Spirit
,
the
heart
of
the
poor
ignorant
creature
to
receive
the
light
of
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
God
in
Christ
,
reconciling
him
to
Himself
,
and
would
*NL*
guide
me
so
to
speak
to
him
from
the
Word
of
God
that
his
conscience
*NL*
might
be
convinced
,
his
eyes
opened
,
and
his
soul
saved
.
When
he
came
*NL*
again
to
me
,
I
entered
into
a
long
discourse
with
him
upon
the
subject
of
*NL*
the
redemption
of
man
by
the
Saviour
of
the
world
,
and
of
the
doctrine
of
*NL*
the
gospel
preached
from
Heaven
,
viz
.
of
repentance
towards
God
,
and
*NL*
faith
in
our
blessed
Lord
Jesus
.
I
then
explained
to
him
as
well
as
I
*NL*
could
why
our
blessed
Redeemer
took
not
on
Him
the
nature
of
angels
but
*NL*
the
seed
of
Abraham
;
and
how
,
for
that
reason
,
the
fallen
angels
had
no
*NL*
share
in
the
redemption
;
that
He
came
only
to
the
lost
sheep
of
the
house
*NL*
of
Israel
,
and
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
,
God
knows
,
more
sincerity
than
knowledge
in
all
the
methods
I
took
*NL*
for
this
poor
creature
's
instruction
,
and
must
acknowledge
,
what
I
*NL*
believe
all
that
act
upon
the
same
principle
will
find
,
that
in
laying
*NL*
things
open
to
him
,
I
really
informed
and
instructed
myself
in
many
*NL*
things
that
either
I
did
not
know
or
had
not
fully
considered
before
,
but
*NL*
which
occurred
naturally
to
my
mind
upon
searching
into
them
,
for
the
*NL*
information
of
this
poor
savage
;
and
I
had
more
affection
in
my
inquiry
*NL*
after
things
upon
this
occasion
than
ever
I
felt
before
:
so
that
,
whether
*NL*
this
poor
wild
wretch
was
better
for
me
or
no
,
I
had
great
reason
to
be
*NL*
thankful
that
ever
he
came
to
me
;
my
grief
sat
lighter
,
upon
me
;
my
*NL*
habitation
grew
comfortable
to
me
beyond
measure
:
and
when
I
reflected
*NL*
that
in
this
solitary
life
which
I
have
been
confined
to
,
I
had
not
only
*NL*
been
moved
to
look
up
to
heaven
myself
,
and
to
seek
the
Hand
that
had
*NL*
brought
me
here
,
but
was
now
to
be
made
an
instrument
,
under
Providence
,
*NL*
to
save
the
life
,
and
,
for
aught
I
knew
,
the
soul
of
a
poor
savage
,
and
*NL*
bring
him
to
the
true
knowledge
of
religion
and
of
the
Christian
*NL*
doctrine
,
that
he
might
know
Christ
Jesus
,
in
whom
is
life
eternal
;
I
*NL*
say
,
when
I
reflected
upon
all
these
things
,
a
secret
joy
ran
through
*NL*
every
part
of
My
soul
,
and
I
frequently
rejoiced
that
ever
I
was
brought
*NL*
to
this
place
,
which
I
had
so
often
thought
the
most
dreadful
of
all
*NL*
afflictions
that
could
possibly
have
befallen
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
continued
in
this
thankful
frame
all
the
remainder
of
my
time
;
and
the
*NL*
conversation
which
employed
the
hours
between
Friday
and
me
was
such
as
*NL*
made
the
three
years
which
we
lived
there
together
perfectly
and
*NL*
completely
happy
,
if
any
such
thing
as
complete
happiness
can
be
formed
*NL*
in
a
sublunary
state
.
This
savage
was
now
a
good
Christian
,
a
much
*NL*
better
than
I
;
though
I
have
reason
to
hope
,
and
bless
God
for
it
,
that
*NL*
we
were
equally
penitent
,
and
comforted
,
restored
penitents
.
We
had
here
*NL*
the
Word
of
God
to
read
,
and
no
farther
off
from
His
Spirit
to
instruct
*NL*
than
if
we
had
been
in
England
.
I
always
applied
myself
,
in
reading
the
*NL*
Scripture
,
to
let
him
know
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
the
meaning
of
what
I
*NL*
read
;
and
he
again
,
by
his
serious
inquiries
and
questionings
,
made
me
,
*NL*
as
I
said
before
,
a
much
better
scholar
in
the
Scripture
knowledge
than
I
*NL*
should
ever
have
been
by
my
own
mere
private
reading
.
Another
thing
I
*NL*
can
not
refrain
from
observing
here
also
,
from
experience
in
this
retired
*NL*
part
of
my
life
,
viz
.
how
infinite
and
inexpressible
a
blessing
it
is
*NL*
that
the
knowledge
of
God
,
and
of
the
doctrine
of
salvation
by
Christ
*NL*
Jesus
,
is
so
plainly
laid
down
in
the
Word
of
God
,
so
easy
to
be
received
*NL*
and
understood
,
that
,
as
the
bare
reading
the
Scripture
made
me
capable
*NL*
of
understanding
enough
of
my
duty
to
carry
me
directly
on
to
the
great
*NL*
work
of
sincere
repentance
for
my
sins
,
and
laying
hold
of
a
Saviour
for
*NL*
life
and
salvation
,
to
a
stated
reformation
in
practice
,
and
obedience
to
*NL*
all
God
's
commands
,
and
this
without
any
teacher
or
instructor
,
I
mean
*NL*
human
;
so
the
same
plain
instruction
sufficiently
served
to
the
*NL*
enlightening
this
savage
creature
,
and
bringing
him
to
be
such
a
*NL*
Christian
as
I
have
known
few
equal
to
him
in
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
all
the
disputes
,
wrangling
,
strife
,
and
contention
which
have
*NL*
happened
in
the
world
about
religion
,
whether
niceties
in
doctrines
or
*NL*
schemes
of
church
government
,
they
were
all
perfectly
useless
to
us
,
and
,
*NL*
for
aught
I
can
yet
see
,
they
have
been
so
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
We
*NL*
had
the
sure
guide
to
heaven
,
viz
.
the
Word
of
God
;
and
we
had
,
blessed
*NL*
be
God
,
comfortable
views
of
the
Spirit
of
God
teaching
and
instructing
*NL*
by
His
word
,
leading
us
into
all
truth
,
and
making
us
both
willing
and
*NL*
obedient
to
the
instruction
of
His
word
.
And
I
can
not
see
the
least
use
*NL*
that
the
greatest
knowledge
of
the
disputed
points
of
religion
,
which
*NL*
have
made
such
confusion
in
the
world
,
would
have
been
to
us
,
if
we
could
*NL*
have
obtained
it
.
But
I
must
go
on
with
the
historical
part
of
things
,
*NL*
and
take
every
part
in
its
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Friday
and
I
became
more
intimately
acquainted
,
and
that
he
could
*NL*
understand
almost
all
I
said
to
him
,
and
speak
pretty
fluently
,
though
in
*NL*
broken
English
,
to
me
,
I
acquainted
him
with
my
own
history
,
or
at
least
*NL*
so
much
of
it
as
related
to
my
coming
to
this
place
:
how
I
had
lived
*NL*
there
,
and
how
long
;
I
let
him
into
the
mystery
,
for
such
it
was
to
him
,
*NL*
of
gunpowder
and
bullet
,
and
taught
him
how
to
shoot
.
I
gave
him
a
*NL*
knife
,
which
he
was
wonderfully
delighted
with
;
and
I
made
him
a
belt
,
*NL*
with
a
frog
hanging
to
it
,
such
as
in
England
we
wear
hangers
in
;
and
in
*NL*
the
frog
,
instead
of
a
hanger
,
I
gave
him
a
hatchet
,
which
was
not
only
*NL*
as
good
a
weapon
in
some
cases
,
but
much
more
useful
upon
other
*NL*
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
described
to
him
the
country
of
Europe
,
particularly
England
,
which
I
*NL*
came
from
;
how
we
lived
,
how
we
worshipped
God
,
how
we
behaved
to
one
*NL*
another
,
and
how
we
traded
in
ships
to
all
parts
of
the
world
.
I
gave
*NL*
him
an
account
of
the
wreck
which
I
had
been
on
board
of
,
and
showed
him
,
*NL*
as
near
as
I
could
,
the
place
where
she
lay
;
but
she
was
all
beaten
in
*NL*
pieces
before
,
and
gone
.
I
showed
him
the
ruins
of
our
boat
,
which
we
*NL*
lost
when
we
escaped
,
and
which
I
could
not
stir
with
my
whole
strength
*NL*
then
;
but
was
now
fallen
almost
all
to
pieces
.
Upon
seeing
this
boat
,
*NL*
Friday
stood
,
musing
a
great
while
,
and
said
nothing
.
I
asked
him
what
*NL*
it
was
he
studied
upon
.
At
last
says
he
,
``
Me
see
such
boat
like
come
to
*NL*
place
at
my
nation
.
''
I
did
not
understand
him
a
good
while
;
but
at
last
,
*NL*
when
I
had
examined
further
into
it
,
I
understood
by
him
that
a
boat
,
*NL*
such
as
that
had
been
,
came
on
shore
upon
the
country
where
he
lived
:
*NL*
that
is
,
as
he
explained
it
,
was
driven
thither
by
stress
of
weather
.
I
*NL*
presently
imagined
that
some
European
ship
must
have
been
cast
away
upon
*NL*
their
coast
,
and
the
boat
might
get
loose
and
drive
ashore
;
but
was
so
*NL*
dull
that
I
never
once
thought
of
men
making
their
escape
from
a
wreck
*NL*
thither
,
much
less
whence
they
might
come
:
so
I
only
inquired
after
a
*NL*
description
of
the
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
described
the
boat
to
me
well
enough
;
but
brought
me
better
to
*NL*
understand
him
when
he
added
with
some
warmth
,
``
We
save
the
white
mans
*NL*
from
drown
.
''
Then
I
presently
asked
if
there
were
any
white
mans
,
as
he
*NL*
called
them
,
in
the
boat
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
;
``
the
boat
full
of
white
mans
.
''
*NL*
I
asked
him
how
many
.
He
told
upon
his
fingers
seventeen
.
I
asked
him
*NL*
then
what
became
of
them
.
He
told
me
,
``
They
live
,
they
dwell
at
my
*NL*
nation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
put
new
thoughts
into
my
head
;
for
I
presently
imagined
that
these
*NL*
might
be
the
men
belonging
to
the
ship
that
was
cast
away
in
the
sight
of
*NL*
my
island
,
as
I
now
called
it
;
and
who
,
after
the
ship
was
struck
on
the
*NL*
rock
,
and
they
saw
her
inevitably
lost
,
had
saved
themselves
in
their
*NL*
boat
,
and
were
landed
upon
that
wild
shore
among
the
savages
.
Upon
this
*NL*
I
inquired
of
him
more
critically
what
was
become
of
them
.
He
assured
me
*NL*
they
lived
still
there
;
that
they
had
been
there
about
four
years
;
that
*NL*
the
savages
left
them
alone
,
and
gave
them
victuals
to
live
on
.
I
asked
*NL*
him
how
it
came
to
pass
they
did
not
kill
them
and
eat
them
.
He
said
,
*NL*
``
No
,
they
make
brother
with
them
;
''
that
is
,
as
I
understood
him
,
a
truce
;
*NL*
and
then
he
added
,
``
They
no
eat
mans
but
when
make
the
war
fight
;
''
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
they
never
eat
any
men
but
such
as
come
to
fight
with
them
and
*NL*
are
taken
in
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
this
some
considerable
time
,
that
being
upon
the
top
of
the
*NL*
hill
at
the
east
side
of
the
island
,
from
whence
,
as
I
have
said
,
I
had
,
*NL*
in
a
clear
day
,
discovered
the
main
or
continent
of
America
,
Friday
,
the
*NL*
weather
being
very
serene
,
looks
very
earnestly
towards
the
mainland
,
*NL*
and
,
in
a
kind
of
surprise
,
falls
a
jumping
and
dancing
,
and
calls
out
to
*NL*
me
,
for
I
was
at
some
distance
from
him
.
I
asked
him
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
.
``
Oh
,
joy
!
''
says
he
;
``
Oh
,
glad
!
there
see
my
country
,
there
my
*NL*
nation
!
''
I
observed
an
extraordinary
sense
of
pleasure
appeared
in
his
*NL*
face
,
and
his
eyes
sparkled
,
and
his
countenance
discovered
a
strange
*NL*
eagerness
,
as
if
he
had
a
mind
to
be
in
his
own
country
again
.
This
*NL*
observation
of
mine
put
a
great
many
thoughts
into
me
,
which
made
me
at
*NL*
first
not
so
easy
about
my
new
man
Friday
as
I
was
before
;
and
I
made
no
*NL*
doubt
but
that
,
if
Friday
could
get
back
to
his
own
nation
again
,
he
*NL*
would
not
only
forget
all
his
religion
but
all
his
obligation
to
me
,
and
*NL*
would
be
forward
enough
to
give
his
countrymen
an
account
of
me
,
and
come
*NL*
back
,
perhaps
with
a
hundred
or
two
of
them
,
and
make
a
feast
upon
me
,
at
*NL*
which
he
might
be
as
merry
as
he
used
to
be
with
those
of
his
enemies
*NL*
when
they
were
taken
in
war
.
But
I
wronged
the
poor
honest
creature
very
*NL*
much
,
for
which
I
was
very
sorry
afterwards
.
However
,
as
my
jealousy
*NL*
increased
,
and
held
some
weeks
,
I
was
a
little
more
circumspect
,
and
not
*NL*
so
familiar
and
kind
to
him
as
before
:
in
which
I
was
certainly
wrong
*NL*
too
;
the
honest
,
grateful
creature
having
no
thought
about
it
but
what
*NL*
consisted
with
the
best
principles
,
both
as
a
religious
Christian
and
as
*NL*
a
grateful
friend
,
as
appeared
afterwards
to
my
full
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
my
jealousy
of
him
lasted
,
you
may
be
sure
I
was
every
day
pumping
*NL*
him
to
see
if
he
would
discover
any
of
the
new
thoughts
which
I
suspected
*NL*
were
in
him
;
but
I
found
everything
he
said
was
so
honest
and
so
*NL*
innocent
,
that
I
could
find
nothing
to
nourish
my
suspicion
;
and
in
spite
*NL*
of
all
my
uneasiness
,
he
made
me
at
last
entirely
his
own
again
;
nor
did
*NL*
he
in
the
least
perceive
that
I
was
uneasy
,
and
therefore
I
could
not
*NL*
suspect
him
of
deceit
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
walking
up
the
same
hill
,
but
the
weather
being
hazy
at
sea
,
so
*NL*
that
we
could
not
see
the
continent
,
I
called
to
him
,
and
said
,
``
Friday
,
*NL*
do
not
you
wish
yourself
in
your
own
country
,
your
own
nation
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
I
be
much
O
glad
to
be
at
my
own
nation
.
''
``
What
would
you
do
*NL*
there
?
''
said
I.
``
Would
you
turn
wild
again
,
eat
men
's
flesh
again
,
and
*NL*
be
a
savage
as
you
were
before
?
''
He
looked
full
of
concern
,
and
shaking
*NL*
his
head
,
said
,
``
No
,
no
,
Friday
tell
them
to
live
good
;
tell
them
to
pray
*NL*
God
;
tell
them
to
eat
corn-bread
,
cattle
flesh
,
milk
;
no
eat
man
again
.
''
*NL*
``
Why
,
then
,
''
said
I
to
him
,
``
they
will
kill
you
.
''
He
looked
grave
at
*NL*
that
,
and
then
said
,
``
No
,
no
,
they
no
kill
me
,
they
willing
love
learn
.
''
*NL*
He
meant
by
this
,
they
would
be
willing
to
learn
.
He
added
,
they
learned
*NL*
much
of
the
bearded
mans
that
came
in
the
boat
.
Then
I
asked
him
if
he
*NL*
would
go
back
to
them
.
He
smiled
at
that
,
and
told
me
that
he
could
not
*NL*
swim
so
far
.
I
told
him
I
would
make
a
canoe
for
him
.
He
told
me
he
*NL*
would
go
if
I
would
go
with
him
.
``
I
go
!
''
says
I
;
``
why
,
they
will
eat
me
*NL*
if
I
come
there
.
''
``
No
,
no
,
''
says
he
,
``
me
make
they
no
eat
you
;
me
make
*NL*
they
much
love
you
.
''
He
meant
,
he
would
tell
them
how
I
had
killed
his
*NL*
enemies
,
and
saved
his
life
,
and
so
he
would
make
them
love
me
.
Then
he
*NL*
told
me
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
how
kind
they
were
to
seventeen
white
men
,
*NL*
or
bearded
men
,
as
he
called
them
who
came
on
shore
there
in
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
,
I
confess
,
I
had
a
mind
to
venture
over
,
and
see
if
I
*NL*
could
possibly
join
with
those
bearded
men
,
who
I
made
no
doubt
were
*NL*
Spaniards
and
Portuguese
;
not
doubting
but
,
if
I
could
,
we
might
find
*NL*
some
method
to
escape
from
thence
,
being
upon
the
continent
,
and
a
good
*NL*
company
together
,
better
than
I
could
from
an
island
forty
miles
off
the
*NL*
shore
,
alone
and
without
help
.
So
,
after
some
days
,
I
took
Friday
to
*NL*
work
again
by
way
of
discourse
,
and
told
him
I
would
give
him
a
boat
to
*NL*
go
back
to
his
own
nation
;
and
,
accordingly
,
I
carried
him
to
my
frigate
,
*NL*
which
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
,
and
having
cleared
it
of
water
*NL*
-LRB-
for
I
always
kept
it
sunk
in
water
-RRB-
,
I
brought
it
out
,
showed
it
him
,
*NL*
and
we
both
went
into
it
.
I
found
he
was
a
most
dexterous
fellow
at
*NL*
managing
it
,
and
would
make
it
go
almost
as
swift
again
as
I
could
.
So
*NL*
when
he
was
in
,
I
said
to
him
,
``
Well
,
now
,
Friday
,
shall
we
go
to
your
*NL*
nation
?
''
He
looked
very
dull
at
my
saying
so
;
which
it
seems
was
because
*NL*
he
thought
the
boat
was
too
small
to
go
so
far
.
I
then
told
him
I
had
a
*NL*
bigger
;
so
the
next
day
I
went
to
the
place
where
the
first
boat
lay
*NL*
which
I
had
made
,
but
which
I
could
not
get
into
the
water
.
He
said
that
*NL*
was
big
enough
;
but
then
,
as
I
had
taken
no
care
of
it
,
and
it
had
lain
*NL*
two
or
three
and
twenty
years
there
,
the
sun
had
so
split
and
dried
it
,
*NL*
that
it
was
rotten
.
Friday
told
me
such
a
boat
would
do
very
well
,
and
*NL*
would
carry
``
much
enough
vittle
,
drink
,
bread
;
''
this
was
his
way
of
*NL*
talking
.

CHAPTER
XVI
--
RESCUE
OF
PRISONERS
FROM
CANNIBALS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
whole
,
I
was
by
this
time
so
fixed
upon
my
design
of
going
over
*NL*
with
him
to
the
continent
that
I
told
him
we
would
go
and
make
one
as
big
*NL*
as
that
,
and
he
should
go
home
in
it
.
He
answered
not
one
word
,
but
*NL*
looked
very
grave
and
sad
.
I
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
with
him
.
He
*NL*
asked
me
again
,
``
Why
you
angry
mad
with
Friday
?
--
what
me
done
?
''
I
asked
*NL*
him
what
he
meant
.
I
told
him
I
was
not
angry
with
him
at
all
.
``
No
*NL*
angry
!
''
says
he
,
repeating
the
words
several
times
;
``
why
send
Friday
home
*NL*
away
to
my
nation
?
''
``
Why
,
''
says
I
,
``
Friday
,
did
not
you
say
you
wished
*NL*
you
were
there
?
''
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
says
he
,
``
wish
we
both
there
;
no
wish
*NL*
Friday
there
,
no
master
there
.
''
In
a
word
,
he
would
not
think
of
going
*NL*
there
without
me
.
``
I
go
there
,
Friday
?
''
says
I
;
``
what
shall
I
do
there
?
''
*NL*
He
turned
very
quick
upon
me
at
this
.
``
You
do
great
deal
much
good
,
''
*NL*
says
he
;
``
you
teach
wild
mans
be
good
,
sober
,
tame
mans
;
you
tell
them
*NL*
know
God
,
pray
God
,
and
live
new
life
.
''
``
Alas
,
Friday
!
''
says
I
,
``
thou
*NL*
knowest
not
what
thou
sayest
;
I
am
but
an
ignorant
man
myself
.
''
``
Yes
,
*NL*
yes
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
teachee
me
good
,
you
teachee
them
good
.
''
``
No
,
no
,
*NL*
Friday
,
''
says
I
,
``
you
shall
go
without
me
;
leave
me
here
to
live
by
*NL*
myself
,
as
I
did
before
.
''
He
looked
confused
again
at
that
word
;
and
*NL*
running
to
one
of
the
hatchets
which
he
used
to
wear
,
he
takes
it
up
*NL*
hastily
,
and
gives
it
to
me
.
``
What
must
I
do
with
this
?
''
says
I
to
him
.
*NL*
``
You
take
kill
Friday
,
''
says
he
.
``
What
must
kill
you
for
?
''
said
I
again
.
*NL*
He
returns
very
quick
--
``
What
you
send
Friday
away
for
?
Take
kill
Friday
,
*NL*
no
send
Friday
away
.
''
This
he
spoke
so
earnestly
that
I
saw
tears
stand
*NL*
in
his
eyes
.
In
a
word
,
I
so
plainly
discovered
the
utmost
affection
in
*NL*
him
to
me
,
and
a
firm
resolution
in
him
,
that
I
told
him
then
and
often
*NL*
after
,
that
I
would
never
send
him
away
from
me
if
he
was
willing
to
stay
*NL*
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
whole
,
as
I
found
by
all
his
discourse
a
settled
affection
to
*NL*
me
,
and
that
nothing
could
part
him
from
me
,
so
I
found
all
the
*NL*
foundation
of
his
desire
to
go
to
his
own
country
was
laid
in
his
ardent
*NL*
affection
to
the
people
,
and
his
hopes
of
my
doing
them
good
;
a
thing
*NL*
which
,
as
I
had
no
notion
of
myself
,
so
I
had
not
the
least
thought
or
*NL*
intention
,
or
desire
of
undertaking
it
.
But
still
I
found
a
strong
*NL*
inclination
to
attempting
my
escape
,
founded
on
the
supposition
gathered
*NL*
from
the
discourse
,
that
there
were
seventeen
bearded
men
there
;
and
*NL*
therefore
,
without
any
more
delay
,
I
went
to
work
with
Friday
to
find
out
*NL*
a
great
tree
proper
to
fell
,
and
make
a
large
periagua
,
or
canoe
,
to
*NL*
undertake
the
voyage
.
There
were
trees
enough
in
the
island
to
have
*NL*
built
a
little
fleet
,
not
of
periaguas
or
canoes
,
but
even
of
good
,
large
*NL*
vessels
;
but
the
main
thing
I
looked
at
was
,
to
get
one
so
near
the
water
*NL*
that
we
might
launch
it
when
it
was
made
,
to
avoid
the
mistake
I
*NL*
committed
at
first
.
At
last
Friday
pitched
upon
a
tree
;
for
I
found
he
*NL*
knew
much
better
than
I
what
kind
of
wood
was
fittest
for
it
;
nor
can
I
*NL*
tell
to
this
day
what
wood
to
call
the
tree
we
cut
down
,
except
that
it
*NL*
was
very
like
the
tree
we
call
fustic
,
or
between
that
and
the
Nicaragua
*NL*
wood
,
for
it
was
much
of
the
same
colour
and
smell
.
Friday
wished
to
*NL*
burn
the
hollow
or
cavity
of
this
tree
out
,
to
make
it
for
a
boat
,
but
I
*NL*
showed
him
how
to
cut
it
with
tools
;
which
,
after
I
had
showed
him
how
to
*NL*
use
,
he
did
very
handily
;
and
in
about
a
month
's
hard
labour
we
finished
*NL*
it
and
made
it
very
handsome
;
especially
when
,
with
our
axes
,
which
I
*NL*
showed
him
how
to
handle
,
we
cut
and
hewed
the
outside
into
the
true
*NL*
shape
of
a
boat
.
After
this
,
however
,
it
cost
us
near
a
fortnight
's
time
*NL*
to
get
her
along
,
as
it
were
inch
by
inch
,
upon
great
rollers
into
the
*NL*
water
;
but
when
she
was
in
,
she
would
have
carried
twenty
men
with
great
*NL*
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
in
the
water
,
though
she
was
so
big
,
it
amazed
me
to
see
*NL*
with
what
dexterity
and
how
swift
my
man
Friday
could
manage
her
,
turn
*NL*
her
,
and
paddle
her
along
.
So
I
asked
him
if
he
would
,
and
if
we
might
*NL*
venture
over
in
her
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
venture
over
in
her
very
well
,
*NL*
though
great
blow
wind
.
''
However
I
had
a
further
design
that
he
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
,
and
that
was
,
to
make
a
mast
and
a
sail
,
and
to
fit
her
with
*NL*
an
anchor
and
cable
.
As
to
a
mast
,
that
was
easy
enough
to
get
;
so
I
*NL*
pitched
upon
a
straight
young
cedar-tree
,
which
I
found
near
the
place
,
*NL*
and
which
there
were
great
plenty
of
in
the
island
,
and
I
set
Friday
to
*NL*
work
to
cut
it
down
,
and
gave
him
directions
how
to
shape
and
order
it
.
*NL*
But
as
to
the
sail
,
that
was
my
particular
care
.
I
knew
I
had
old
sails
,
*NL*
or
rather
pieces
of
old
sails
,
enough
;
but
as
I
had
had
them
now
*NL*
six-and-twenty
years
by
me
,
and
had
not
been
very
careful
to
preserve
*NL*
them
,
not
imagining
that
I
should
ever
have
this
kind
of
use
for
them
,
I
*NL*
did
not
doubt
but
they
were
all
rotten
;
and
,
indeed
,
most
of
them
were
*NL*
so
.
However
,
I
found
two
pieces
which
appeared
pretty
good
,
and
with
*NL*
these
I
went
to
work
;
and
with
a
great
deal
of
pains
,
and
awkward
*NL*
stitching
,
you
may
be
sure
,
for
want
of
needles
,
I
at
length
made
a
*NL*
three-cornered
ugly
thing
,
like
what
we
call
in
England
a
*NL*
shoulder-of-mutton
sail
,
to
go
with
a
boom
at
bottom
,
and
a
little
short
*NL*
sprit
at
the
top
,
such
as
usually
our
ships
'
long-boats
sail
with
,
and
*NL*
such
as
I
best
knew
how
to
manage
,
as
it
was
such
a
one
as
I
had
to
the
*NL*
boat
in
which
I
made
my
escape
from
Barbary
,
as
related
in
the
first
part
*NL*
of
my
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
near
two
months
performing
this
last
work
,
viz
.
rigging
and
fitting
*NL*
my
masts
and
sails
;
for
I
finished
them
very
complete
,
making
a
small
*NL*
stay
,
and
a
sail
,
or
foresail
,
to
it
,
to
assist
if
we
should
turn
to
*NL*
windward
;
and
,
what
was
more
than
all
,
I
fixed
a
rudder
to
the
stern
of
*NL*
her
to
steer
with
.
I
was
but
a
bungling
shipwright
,
yet
as
I
knew
the
*NL*
usefulness
and
even
necessity
of
such
a
thing
,
I
applied
myself
with
so
*NL*
much
pains
to
do
it
,
that
at
last
I
brought
it
to
pass
;
though
,
*NL*
considering
the
many
dull
contrivances
I
had
for
it
that
failed
,
I
think
*NL*
it
cost
me
almost
as
much
labour
as
making
the
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
this
was
done
,
I
had
my
man
Friday
to
teach
as
to
what
belonged
*NL*
to
the
navigation
of
my
boat
;
though
he
knew
very
well
how
to
paddle
a
*NL*
canoe
,
he
knew
nothing
of
what
belonged
to
a
sail
and
a
rudder
;
and
was
*NL*
the
most
amazed
when
he
saw
me
work
the
boat
to
and
again
in
the
sea
by
*NL*
the
rudder
,
and
how
the
sail
jibed
,
and
filled
this
way
or
that
way
as
*NL*
the
course
we
sailed
changed
;
I
say
when
he
saw
this
he
stood
like
one
*NL*
astonished
and
amazed
.
However
,
with
a
little
use
,
I
made
all
these
*NL*
things
familiar
to
him
,
and
he
became
an
expert
sailor
,
except
that
of
*NL*
the
compass
I
could
make
him
understand
very
little
.
On
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
as
there
was
very
little
cloudy
weather
,
and
seldom
or
never
any
fogs
in
*NL*
those
parts
,
there
was
the
less
occasion
for
a
compass
,
seeing
the
stars
*NL*
were
always
to
be
seen
by
night
,
and
the
shore
by
day
,
except
in
the
*NL*
rainy
seasons
,
and
then
nobody
cared
to
stir
abroad
either
by
land
or
*NL*
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
entered
on
the
seven-and-twentieth
year
of
my
captivity
in
this
*NL*
place
;
though
the
three
last
years
that
I
had
this
creature
with
me
ought
*NL*
rather
to
be
left
out
of
the
account
,
my
habitation
being
quite
of
*NL*
another
kind
than
in
all
the
rest
of
the
time
.
I
kept
the
anniversary
of
*NL*
my
landing
here
with
the
same
thankfulness
to
God
for
His
mercies
as
at
*NL*
first
:
and
if
I
had
such
cause
of
acknowledgment
at
first
,
I
had
much
*NL*
more
so
now
,
having
such
additional
testimonies
of
the
care
of
Providence
*NL*
over
me
,
and
the
great
hopes
I
had
of
being
effectually
and
speedily
*NL*
delivered
;
for
I
had
an
invincible
impression
upon
my
thoughts
that
my
*NL*
deliverance
was
at
hand
,
and
that
I
should
not
be
another
year
in
this
*NL*
place
.
I
went
on
,
however
,
with
my
husbandry
;
digging
,
planting
,
and
*NL*
fencing
as
usual
.
I
gathered
and
cured
my
grapes
,
and
did
every
*NL*
necessary
thing
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rainy
season
was
in
the
meantime
upon
me
,
when
I
kept
more
within
*NL*
doors
than
at
other
times
.
We
had
stowed
our
new
vessel
as
secure
as
we
*NL*
could
,
bringing
her
up
into
the
creek
,
where
,
as
I
said
in
the
beginning
,
*NL*
I
landed
my
rafts
from
the
ship
;
and
hauling
her
up
to
the
shore
at
*NL*
high-water
mark
,
I
made
my
man
Friday
dig
a
little
dock
,
just
big
enough
*NL*
to
hold
her
,
and
just
deep
enough
to
give
her
water
enough
to
float
in
;
*NL*
and
then
,
when
the
tide
was
out
,
we
made
a
strong
dam
across
the
end
of
*NL*
it
,
to
keep
the
water
out
;
and
so
she
lay
,
dry
as
to
the
tide
from
the
*NL*
sea
:
and
to
keep
the
rain
off
we
laid
a
great
many
boughs
of
trees
,
so
*NL*
thick
that
she
was
as
well
thatched
as
a
house
;
and
thus
we
waited
for
*NL*
the
months
of
November
and
December
,
in
which
I
designed
to
make
my
*NL*
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
settled
season
began
to
come
in
,
as
the
thought
of
my
design
*NL*
returned
with
the
fair
weather
,
I
was
preparing
daily
for
the
voyage
.
*NL*
And
the
first
thing
I
did
was
to
lay
by
a
certain
quantity
of
provisions
,
*NL*
being
the
stores
for
our
voyage
;
and
intended
in
a
week
or
a
fortnight
's
*NL*
time
to
open
the
dock
,
and
launch
out
our
boat
.
I
was
busy
one
morning
*NL*
upon
something
of
this
kind
,
when
I
called
to
Friday
,
and
bid
him
to
go
*NL*
to
the
sea-shore
and
see
if
he
could
find
a
turtle
or
a
tortoise
,
a
thing
*NL*
which
we
generally
got
once
a
week
,
for
the
sake
of
the
eggs
as
well
as
*NL*
the
flesh
.
Friday
had
not
been
long
gone
when
he
came
running
back
,
and
*NL*
flew
over
my
outer
wall
or
fence
,
like
one
that
felt
not
the
ground
or
*NL*
the
steps
he
set
his
foot
on
;
and
before
I
had
time
to
speak
to
him
he
*NL*
cries
out
to
me
,
``
O
master
!
O
master
!
O
sorrow
!
O
bad
!
''
--
``
What
's
the
*NL*
matter
,
Friday
?
''
says
I.
``
O
yonder
there
,
''
says
he
,
``
one
,
two
,
three
*NL*
canoes
;
one
,
two
,
three
!
''
By
this
way
of
speaking
I
concluded
there
were
*NL*
six
;
but
on
inquiry
I
found
there
were
but
three
.
``
Well
,
Friday
,
''
says
*NL*
I
,
``
do
not
be
frightened
.
''
So
I
heartened
him
up
as
well
as
I
could
.
*NL*
However
,
I
saw
the
poor
fellow
was
most
terribly
scared
,
for
nothing
ran
*NL*
in
his
head
but
that
they
were
come
to
look
for
him
,
and
would
cut
him
in
*NL*
pieces
and
eat
him
;
and
the
poor
fellow
trembled
so
that
I
scarcely
knew
*NL*
what
to
do
with
him
.
I
comforted
him
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
told
him
I
*NL*
was
in
as
much
danger
as
he
,
and
that
they
would
eat
me
as
well
as
him
.
*NL*
``
But
,
''
says
I
,
``
Friday
,
we
must
resolve
to
fight
them
.
Can
you
fight
,
*NL*
Friday
?
''
``
Me
shoot
,
''
says
he
,
``
but
there
come
many
great
number
.
''
``
No
*NL*
matter
for
that
,
''
said
I
again
;
``
our
guns
will
fright
them
that
we
do
not
*NL*
kill
.
''
So
I
asked
him
whether
,
if
I
resolved
to
defend
him
,
he
would
*NL*
defend
me
,
and
stand
by
me
,
and
do
just
as
I
bid
him
.
He
said
,
``
Me
die
*NL*
when
you
bid
die
,
master
.
''
So
I
went
and
fetched
a
good
dram
of
rum
and
*NL*
gave
him
;
for
I
had
been
so
good
a
husband
of
my
rum
that
I
had
a
great
*NL*
deal
left
.
When
we
had
drunk
it
,
I
made
him
take
the
two
fowling-pieces
,
*NL*
which
we
always
carried
,
and
loaded
them
with
large
swan-shot
,
as
big
as
*NL*
small
pistol-bullets
.
Then
I
took
four
muskets
,
and
loaded
them
with
two
*NL*
slugs
and
five
small
bullets
each
;
and
my
two
pistols
I
loaded
with
a
*NL*
brace
of
bullets
each
.
I
hung
my
great
sword
,
as
usual
,
naked
by
my
*NL*
side
,
and
gave
Friday
his
hatchet
.
When
I
had
thus
prepared
myself
,
I
*NL*
took
my
perspective
glass
,
and
went
up
to
the
side
of
the
hill
,
to
see
*NL*
what
I
could
discover
;
and
I
found
quickly
by
my
glass
that
there
were
*NL*
one-and-twenty
savages
,
three
prisoners
,
and
three
canoes
;
and
that
their
*NL*
whole
business
seemed
to
be
the
triumphant
banquet
upon
these
three
human
*NL*
bodies
:
a
barbarous
feast
,
indeed
!
but
nothing
more
than
,
as
I
had
*NL*
observed
,
was
usual
with
them
.
I
observed
also
that
they
had
landed
,
not
*NL*
where
they
had
done
when
Friday
made
his
escape
,
but
nearer
to
my
creek
,
*NL*
where
the
shore
was
low
,
and
where
a
thick
wood
came
almost
close
down
to
*NL*
the
sea
.
This
,
with
the
abhorrence
of
the
inhuman
errand
these
wretches
*NL*
came
about
,
filled
me
with
such
indignation
that
I
came
down
again
to
*NL*
Friday
,
and
told
him
I
was
resolved
to
go
down
to
them
and
kill
them
all
;
*NL*
and
asked
him
if
he
would
stand
by
me
.
He
had
now
got
over
his
fright
,
*NL*
and
his
spirits
being
a
little
raised
with
the
dram
I
had
given
him
,
he
*NL*
was
very
cheerful
,
and
told
me
,
as
before
,
he
would
die
when
I
bid
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
fit
of
fury
I
divided
the
arms
which
I
had
charged
,
as
before
,
*NL*
between
us
;
I
gave
Friday
one
pistol
to
stick
in
his
girdle
,
and
three
*NL*
guns
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
I
took
one
pistol
and
the
other
three
guns
*NL*
myself
;
and
in
this
posture
we
marched
out
.
I
took
a
small
bottle
of
rum
*NL*
in
my
pocket
,
and
gave
Friday
a
large
bag
with
more
powder
and
bullets
;
*NL*
and
as
to
orders
,
I
charged
him
to
keep
close
behind
me
,
and
not
to
stir
,
*NL*
or
shoot
,
or
do
anything
till
I
bid
him
,
and
in
the
meantime
not
to
speak
*NL*
a
word
.
In
this
posture
I
fetched
a
compass
to
my
right
hand
of
near
a
*NL*
mile
,
as
well
to
get
over
the
creek
as
to
get
into
the
wood
,
so
that
I
*NL*
could
come
within
shot
of
them
before
I
should
be
discovered
,
which
I
had
*NL*
seen
by
my
glass
it
was
easy
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
making
this
march
,
my
former
thoughts
returning
,
I
began
to
*NL*
abate
my
resolution
:
I
do
not
mean
that
I
entertained
any
fear
of
their
*NL*
number
,
for
as
they
were
naked
,
unarmed
wretches
,
it
is
certain
I
was
*NL*
superior
to
them
--
nay
,
though
I
had
been
alone
.
But
it
occurred
to
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
what
call
,
what
occasion
,
much
less
what
necessity
I
was
in
to
*NL*
go
and
dip
my
hands
in
blood
,
to
attack
people
who
had
neither
done
or
*NL*
intended
me
any
wrong
?
who
,
as
to
me
,
were
innocent
,
and
whose
barbarous
*NL*
customs
were
their
own
disaster
,
being
in
them
a
token
,
indeed
,
of
God
's
*NL*
having
left
them
,
with
the
other
nations
of
that
part
of
the
world
,
to
*NL*
such
stupidity
,
and
to
such
inhuman
courses
,
but
did
not
call
me
to
take
*NL*
upon
me
to
be
a
judge
of
their
actions
,
much
less
an
executioner
of
His
*NL*
justice
--
that
whenever
He
thought
fit
He
would
take
the
cause
into
His
*NL*
own
hands
,
and
by
national
vengeance
punish
them
as
a
people
for
national
*NL*
crimes
,
but
that
,
in
the
meantime
,
it
was
none
of
my
business
--
that
it
*NL*
was
true
Friday
might
justify
it
,
because
he
was
a
declared
enemy
and
in
*NL*
a
state
of
war
with
those
very
particular
people
,
and
it
was
lawful
for
*NL*
him
to
attack
them
--
but
I
could
not
say
the
same
with
regard
to
myself
.
*NL*
These
things
were
so
warmly
pressed
upon
my
thoughts
all
the
way
as
I
*NL*
went
,
that
I
resolved
I
would
only
go
and
place
myself
near
them
that
I
*NL*
might
observe
their
barbarous
feast
,
and
that
I
would
act
then
as
God
*NL*
should
direct
;
but
that
unless
something
offered
that
was
more
a
call
to
*NL*
me
than
yet
I
knew
of
,
I
would
not
meddle
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
resolution
I
entered
the
wood
,
and
,
with
all
possible
wariness
*NL*
and
silence
,
Friday
following
close
at
my
heels
,
I
marched
till
I
came
to
*NL*
the
skirts
of
the
wood
on
the
side
which
was
next
to
them
,
only
that
one
*NL*
corner
of
the
wood
lay
between
me
and
them
.
Here
I
called
softly
to
*NL*
Friday
,
and
showing
him
a
great
tree
which
was
just
at
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
wood
,
I
bade
him
go
to
the
tree
,
and
bring
me
word
if
he
could
see
there
*NL*
plainly
what
they
were
doing
.
He
did
so
,
and
came
immediately
back
to
*NL*
me
,
and
told
me
they
might
be
plainly
viewed
there
--
that
they
were
all
*NL*
about
their
fire
,
eating
the
flesh
of
one
of
their
prisoners
,
and
that
*NL*
another
lay
bound
upon
the
sand
a
little
from
them
,
whom
he
said
they
*NL*
would
kill
next
;
and
this
fired
the
very
soul
within
me
.
He
told
me
it
*NL*
was
not
one
of
their
nation
,
but
one
of
the
bearded
men
he
had
told
me
*NL*
of
,
that
came
to
their
country
in
the
boat
.
I
was
filled
with
horror
at
*NL*
the
very
naming
of
the
white
bearded
man
;
and
going
to
the
tree
,
I
saw
*NL*
plainly
by
my
glass
a
white
man
,
who
lay
upon
the
beach
of
the
sea
with
*NL*
his
hands
and
his
feet
tied
with
flags
,
or
things
like
rushes
,
and
that
*NL*
he
was
an
European
,
and
had
clothes
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
tree
and
a
little
thicket
beyond
it
,
about
fifty
yards
*NL*
nearer
to
them
than
the
place
where
I
was
,
which
,
by
going
a
little
way
*NL*
about
,
I
saw
I
might
come
at
undiscovered
,
and
that
then
I
should
be
*NL*
within
half
a
shot
of
them
;
so
I
withheld
my
passion
,
though
I
was
indeed
*NL*
enraged
to
the
highest
degree
;
and
going
back
about
twenty
paces
,
I
got
*NL*
behind
some
bushes
,
which
held
all
the
way
till
I
came
to
the
other
tree
,
*NL*
and
then
came
to
a
little
rising
ground
,
which
gave
me
a
full
view
of
*NL*
them
at
the
distance
of
about
eighty
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
not
a
moment
to
lose
,
for
nineteen
of
the
dreadful
wretches
sat
*NL*
upon
the
ground
,
all
close
huddled
together
,
and
had
just
sent
the
other
*NL*
two
to
butcher
the
poor
Christian
,
and
bring
him
perhaps
limb
by
limb
to
*NL*
their
fire
,
and
they
were
stooping
down
to
untie
the
bands
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
I
turned
to
Friday
.
``
Now
,
Friday
,
''
said
I
,
``
do
as
I
bid
thee
.
''
Friday
*NL*
said
he
would
.
``
Then
,
Friday
,
''
says
I
,
``
do
exactly
as
you
see
me
do
;
*NL*
fail
in
nothing
.
''
So
I
set
down
one
of
the
muskets
and
the
fowling-piece
*NL*
upon
the
ground
,
and
Friday
did
the
like
by
his
,
and
with
the
other
*NL*
musket
I
took
my
aim
at
the
savages
,
bidding
him
to
do
the
like
;
then
*NL*
asking
him
if
he
was
ready
,
he
said
,
``
Yes
.
''
``
Then
fire
at
them
,
''
said
I
;
*NL*
and
at
the
same
moment
I
fired
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
took
his
aim
so
much
better
than
I
,
that
on
the
side
that
he
shot
*NL*
he
killed
two
of
them
,
and
wounded
three
more
;
and
on
my
side
I
killed
*NL*
one
,
and
wounded
two
.
They
were
,
you
may
be
sure
,
in
a
dreadful
*NL*
consternation
:
and
all
of
them
that
were
not
hurt
jumped
upon
their
feet
,
*NL*
but
did
not
immediately
know
which
way
to
run
,
or
which
way
to
look
,
for
*NL*
they
knew
not
from
whence
their
destruction
came
.
Friday
kept
his
eyes
*NL*
close
upon
me
,
that
,
as
I
had
bid
him
,
he
might
observe
what
I
did
;
so
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
the
first
shot
was
made
,
I
threw
down
the
piece
,
and
took
up
*NL*
the
fowling-piece
,
and
Friday
did
the
like
;
he
saw
me
cock
and
present
;
*NL*
he
did
the
same
again
.
``
Are
you
ready
,
Friday
?
''
said
I.
``
Yes
,
''
says
he
.
*NL*
``
Let
fly
,
then
,
''
says
I
,
``
in
the
name
of
God
!
''
and
with
that
I
fired
*NL*
again
among
the
amazed
wretches
,
and
so
did
Friday
;
and
as
our
pieces
*NL*
were
now
loaded
with
what
I
call
swan-shot
,
or
small
pistol-bullets
,
we
*NL*
found
only
two
drop
;
but
so
many
were
wounded
that
they
ran
about
yelling
*NL*
and
screaming
like
mad
creatures
,
all
bloody
,
and
most
of
them
miserably
*NL*
wounded
;
whereof
three
more
fell
quickly
after
,
though
not
quite
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Friday
,
''
says
I
,
laying
down
the
discharged
pieces
,
and
taking
up
*NL*
the
musket
which
was
yet
loaded
,
``
follow
me
,
''
which
he
did
with
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
courage
;
upon
which
I
rushed
out
of
the
wood
and
showed
myself
,
*NL*
and
Friday
close
at
my
foot
.
As
soon
as
I
perceived
they
saw
me
,
I
*NL*
shouted
as
loud
as
I
could
,
and
bade
Friday
do
so
too
,
and
running
as
*NL*
fast
as
I
could
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
was
not
very
fast
,
being
loaded
with
*NL*
arms
as
I
was
,
I
made
directly
towards
the
poor
victim
,
who
was
,
as
I
*NL*
said
,
lying
upon
the
beach
or
shore
,
between
the
place
where
they
sat
and
*NL*
the
sea
.
The
two
butchers
who
were
just
going
to
work
with
him
had
left
*NL*
him
at
the
surprise
of
our
first
fire
,
and
fled
in
a
terrible
fright
to
*NL*
the
seaside
,
and
had
jumped
into
a
canoe
,
and
three
more
of
the
rest
made
*NL*
the
same
way
.
I
turned
to
Friday
,
and
bade
him
step
forwards
and
fire
at
*NL*
them
;
he
understood
me
immediately
,
and
running
about
forty
yards
,
to
be
*NL*
nearer
them
,
he
shot
at
them
;
and
I
thought
he
had
killed
them
all
,
for
I
*NL*
saw
them
all
fall
of
a
heap
into
the
boat
,
though
I
saw
two
of
them
up
*NL*
again
quickly
;
however
,
he
killed
two
of
them
,
and
wounded
the
third
,
so
*NL*
that
he
lay
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
as
if
he
had
been
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
my
man
Friday
fired
at
them
,
I
pulled
out
my
knife
and
cut
the
*NL*
flags
that
bound
the
poor
victim
;
and
loosing
his
hands
and
feet
,
I
*NL*
lifted
him
up
,
and
asked
him
in
the
Portuguese
tongue
what
he
was
.
He
*NL*
answered
in
Latin
,
Christianus
;
but
was
so
weak
and
faint
that
he
could
*NL*
scarce
stand
or
speak
.
I
took
my
bottle
out
of
my
pocket
and
gave
it
*NL*
him
,
making
signs
that
he
should
drink
,
which
he
did
;
and
I
gave
him
a
*NL*
piece
of
bread
,
which
he
ate
.
Then
I
asked
him
what
countryman
he
was
:
*NL*
and
he
said
,
Espagniole
;
and
being
a
little
recovered
,
let
me
know
,
by
*NL*
all
the
signs
he
could
possibly
make
,
how
much
he
was
in
my
debt
for
his
*NL*
deliverance
.
``
Seignior
,
''
said
I
,
with
as
much
Spanish
as
I
could
make
*NL*
up
,
``
we
will
talk
afterwards
,
but
we
must
fight
now
:
if
you
have
any
*NL*
strength
left
,
take
this
pistol
and
sword
,
and
lay
about
you
.
''
He
took
*NL*
them
very
thankfully
;
and
no
sooner
had
he
the
arms
in
his
hands
,
but
,
as
*NL*
if
they
had
put
new
vigour
into
him
,
he
flew
upon
his
murderers
like
a
*NL*
fury
,
and
had
cut
two
of
them
in
pieces
in
an
instant
;
for
the
truth
is
,
*NL*
as
the
whole
was
a
surprise
to
them
,
so
the
poor
creatures
were
so
much
*NL*
frightened
with
the
noise
of
our
pieces
that
they
fell
down
for
mere
*NL*
amazement
and
fear
,
and
had
no
more
power
to
attempt
their
own
escape
*NL*
than
their
flesh
had
to
resist
our
shot
;
and
that
was
the
case
of
those
*NL*
five
that
Friday
shot
at
in
the
boat
;
for
as
three
of
them
fell
with
the
*NL*
hurt
they
received
,
so
the
other
two
fell
with
the
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
my
piece
in
my
hand
still
without
firing
,
being
willing
to
keep
my
*NL*
charge
ready
,
because
I
had
given
the
Spaniard
my
pistol
and
sword
:
so
I
*NL*
called
to
Friday
,
and
bade
him
run
up
to
the
tree
from
whence
we
first
*NL*
fired
,
and
fetch
the
arms
which
lay
there
that
had
been
discharged
,
which
*NL*
he
did
with
great
swiftness
;
and
then
giving
him
my
musket
,
I
sat
down
*NL*
myself
to
load
all
the
rest
again
,
and
bade
them
come
to
me
when
they
*NL*
wanted
.
While
I
was
loading
these
pieces
,
there
happened
a
fierce
*NL*
engagement
between
the
Spaniard
and
one
of
the
savages
,
who
made
at
him
*NL*
with
one
of
their
great
wooden
swords
,
the
weapon
that
was
to
have
killed
*NL*
him
before
,
if
I
had
not
prevented
it
.
The
Spaniard
,
who
was
as
bold
and
*NL*
brave
as
could
be
imagined
,
though
weak
,
had
fought
the
Indian
a
good
*NL*
while
,
and
had
cut
two
great
wounds
on
his
head
;
but
the
savage
being
a
*NL*
stout
,
lusty
fellow
,
closing
in
with
him
,
had
thrown
him
down
,
being
*NL*
faint
,
and
was
wringing
my
sword
out
of
his
hand
;
when
the
Spaniard
,
*NL*
though
undermost
,
wisely
quitting
the
sword
,
drew
the
pistol
from
his
*NL*
girdle
,
shot
the
savage
through
the
body
,
and
killed
him
upon
the
spot
,
*NL*
before
I
,
who
was
running
to
help
him
,
could
come
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
,
being
now
left
to
his
liberty
,
pursued
the
flying
wretches
,
with
*NL*
no
weapon
in
his
hand
but
his
hatchet
:
and
with
that
he
despatched
those
*NL*
three
who
as
I
said
before
,
were
wounded
at
first
,
and
fallen
,
and
all
*NL*
the
rest
he
could
come
up
with
:
and
the
Spaniard
coming
to
me
for
a
gun
,
*NL*
I
gave
him
one
of
the
fowling-pieces
,
with
which
he
pursued
two
of
the
*NL*
savages
,
and
wounded
them
both
;
but
as
he
was
not
able
to
run
,
they
both
*NL*
got
from
him
into
the
wood
,
where
Friday
pursued
them
,
and
killed
one
of
*NL*
them
,
but
the
other
was
too
nimble
for
him
;
and
though
he
was
wounded
,
*NL*
yet
had
plunged
himself
into
the
sea
,
and
swam
with
all
his
might
off
to
*NL*
those
two
who
were
left
in
the
canoe
;
which
three
in
the
canoe
,
with
one
*NL*
wounded
,
that
we
knew
not
whether
he
died
or
no
,
were
all
that
escaped
*NL*
our
hands
of
one-and-twenty
.
The
account
of
the
whole
is
as
follows
:
*NL*
Three
killed
at
our
first
shot
from
the
tree
;
two
killed
at
the
next
*NL*
shot
;
two
killed
by
Friday
in
the
boat
;
two
killed
by
Friday
of
those
at
*NL*
first
wounded
;
one
killed
by
Friday
in
the
wood
;
three
killed
by
the
*NL*
Spaniard
;
four
killed
,
being
found
dropped
here
and
there
,
of
the
wounds
,
*NL*
or
killed
by
Friday
in
his
chase
of
them
;
four
escaped
in
the
boat
,
*NL*
whereof
one
wounded
,
if
not
dead
--
twenty-one
in
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
that
were
in
the
canoe
worked
hard
to
get
out
of
gun-shot
,
and
*NL*
though
Friday
made
two
or
three
shots
at
them
,
I
did
not
find
that
he
hit
*NL*
any
of
them
.
Friday
would
fain
have
had
me
take
one
of
their
canoes
,
and
*NL*
pursue
them
;
and
indeed
I
was
very
anxious
about
their
escape
,
lest
,
*NL*
carrying
the
news
home
to
their
people
,
they
should
come
back
perhaps
*NL*
with
two
or
three
hundred
of
the
canoes
and
devour
us
by
mere
multitude
;
*NL*
so
I
consented
to
pursue
them
by
sea
,
and
running
to
one
of
their
canoes
,
*NL*
I
jumped
in
and
bade
Friday
follow
me
:
but
when
I
was
in
the
canoe
I
was
*NL*
surprised
to
find
another
poor
creature
lie
there
,
bound
hand
and
foot
,
*NL*
as
the
Spaniard
was
,
for
the
slaughter
,
and
almost
dead
with
fear
,
not
*NL*
knowing
what
was
the
matter
;
for
he
had
not
been
able
to
look
up
over
the
*NL*
side
of
the
boat
,
he
was
tied
so
hard
neck
and
heels
,
and
had
been
tied
*NL*
so
long
that
he
had
really
but
little
life
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
immediately
cut
the
twisted
flags
or
rushes
which
they
had
bound
him
*NL*
with
,
and
would
have
helped
him
up
;
but
he
could
not
stand
or
speak
,
but
*NL*
groaned
most
piteously
,
believing
,
it
seems
,
still
,
that
he
was
only
*NL*
unbound
in
order
to
be
killed
.
When
Friday
came
to
him
I
bade
him
speak
*NL*
to
him
,
and
tell
him
of
his
deliverance
;
and
pulling
out
my
bottle
,
made
*NL*
him
give
the
poor
wretch
a
dram
,
which
,
with
the
news
of
his
being
*NL*
delivered
,
revived
him
,
and
he
sat
up
in
the
boat
.
But
when
Friday
came
*NL*
to
hear
him
speak
,
and
look
in
his
face
,
it
would
have
moved
any
one
to
*NL*
tears
to
have
seen
how
Friday
kissed
him
,
embraced
him
,
hugged
him
,
*NL*
cried
,
laughed
,
hallooed
,
jumped
about
,
danced
,
sang
;
then
cried
again
,
*NL*
wrung
his
hands
,
beat
his
own
face
and
head
;
and
then
sang
and
jumped
*NL*
about
again
like
a
distracted
creature
.
It
was
a
good
while
before
I
*NL*
could
make
him
speak
to
me
or
tell
me
what
was
the
matter
;
but
when
he
*NL*
came
a
little
to
himself
he
told
me
that
it
was
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
easy
for
me
to
express
how
it
moved
me
to
see
what
ecstasy
and
*NL*
filial
affection
had
worked
in
this
poor
savage
at
the
sight
of
his
*NL*
father
,
and
of
his
being
delivered
from
death
;
nor
indeed
can
I
describe
*NL*
half
the
extravagances
of
his
affection
after
this
:
for
he
went
into
the
*NL*
boat
and
out
of
the
boat
a
great
many
times
:
when
he
went
in
to
him
he
*NL*
would
sit
down
by
him
,
open
his
breast
,
and
hold
his
father
's
head
close
*NL*
to
his
bosom
for
many
minutes
together
,
to
nourish
it
;
then
he
took
his
*NL*
arms
and
ankles
,
which
were
numbed
and
stiff
with
the
binding
,
and
chafed
*NL*
and
rubbed
them
with
his
hands
;
and
I
,
perceiving
what
the
case
was
,
gave
*NL*
him
some
rum
out
of
my
bottle
to
rub
them
with
,
which
did
them
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
affair
put
an
end
to
our
pursuit
of
the
canoe
with
the
other
*NL*
savages
,
who
were
now
almost
out
of
sight
;
and
it
was
happy
for
us
that
*NL*
we
did
not
,
for
it
blew
so
hard
within
two
hours
after
,
and
before
they
*NL*
could
be
got
a
quarter
of
their
way
,
and
continued
blowing
so
hard
all
*NL*
night
,
and
that
from
the
north-west
,
which
was
against
them
,
that
I
could
*NL*
not
suppose
their
boat
could
live
,
or
that
they
ever
reached
their
own
*NL*
coast
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
Friday
;
he
was
so
busy
about
his
father
that
I
could
not
*NL*
find
in
my
heart
to
take
him
off
for
some
time
;
but
after
I
thought
he
*NL*
could
leave
him
a
little
,
I
called
him
to
me
,
and
he
came
jumping
and
*NL*
laughing
,
and
pleased
to
the
highest
extreme
:
then
I
asked
him
if
he
had
*NL*
given
his
father
any
bread
.
He
shook
his
head
,
and
said
,
``
None
;
ugly
dog
*NL*
eat
all
up
self
.
''
I
then
gave
him
a
cake
of
bread
out
of
a
little
pouch
*NL*
I
carried
on
purpose
;
I
also
gave
him
a
dram
for
himself
;
but
he
would
*NL*
not
taste
it
,
but
carried
it
to
his
father
.
I
had
in
my
pocket
two
or
*NL*
three
bunches
of
raisins
,
so
I
gave
him
a
handful
of
them
for
his
father
.
*NL*
He
had
no
sooner
given
his
father
these
raisins
but
I
saw
him
come
out
of
*NL*
the
boat
,
and
run
away
as
if
he
had
been
bewitched
,
for
he
was
the
*NL*
swiftest
fellow
on
his
feet
that
ever
I
saw
:
I
say
,
he
ran
at
such
a
rate
*NL*
that
he
was
out
of
sight
,
as
it
were
,
in
an
instant
;
and
though
I
called
,
*NL*
and
hallooed
out
too
after
him
,
it
was
all
one
--
away
he
went
;
and
in
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
I
saw
him
come
back
again
,
though
not
so
fast
as
he
*NL*
went
;
and
as
he
came
nearer
I
found
his
pace
slacker
,
because
he
had
*NL*
something
in
his
hand
.
When
he
came
up
to
me
I
found
he
had
been
quite
*NL*
home
for
an
earthen
jug
or
pot
,
to
bring
his
father
some
fresh
water
,
and
*NL*
that
he
had
got
two
more
cakes
or
loaves
of
bread
:
the
bread
he
gave
me
,
*NL*
but
the
water
he
carried
to
his
father
;
however
,
as
I
was
very
thirsty
*NL*
too
,
I
took
a
little
of
it
.
The
water
revived
his
father
more
than
all
*NL*
the
rum
or
spirits
I
had
given
him
,
for
he
was
fainting
with
thirst
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
father
had
drunk
,
I
called
to
him
to
know
if
there
was
any
water
*NL*
left
.
He
said
,
``
Yes
''
;
and
I
bade
him
give
it
to
the
poor
Spaniard
,
who
*NL*
was
in
as
much
want
of
it
as
his
father
;
and
I
sent
one
of
the
cakes
that
*NL*
Friday
brought
to
the
Spaniard
too
,
who
was
indeed
very
weak
,
and
was
*NL*
reposing
himself
upon
a
green
place
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
;
and
whose
*NL*
limbs
were
also
very
stiff
,
and
very
much
swelled
with
the
rude
bandage
*NL*
he
had
been
tied
with
.
When
I
saw
that
upon
Friday
's
coming
to
him
with
*NL*
the
water
he
sat
up
and
drank
,
and
took
the
bread
and
began
to
eat
,
I
*NL*
went
to
him
and
gave
him
a
handful
of
raisins
.
He
looked
up
in
my
face
*NL*
with
all
the
tokens
of
gratitude
and
thankfulness
that
could
appear
in
*NL*
any
countenance
;
but
was
so
weak
,
notwithstanding
he
had
so
exerted
*NL*
himself
in
the
fight
,
that
he
could
not
stand
up
upon
his
feet
--
he
tried
*NL*
to
do
it
two
or
three
times
,
but
was
really
not
able
,
his
ankles
were
so
*NL*
swelled
and
so
painful
to
him
;
so
I
bade
him
sit
still
,
and
caused
Friday
*NL*
to
rub
his
ankles
,
and
bathe
them
with
rum
,
as
he
had
done
his
father
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
observed
the
poor
affectionate
creature
,
every
two
minutes
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
less
,
all
the
while
he
was
here
,
turn
his
head
about
to
see
if
his
father
*NL*
was
in
the
same
place
and
posture
as
he
left
him
sitting
;
and
at
last
he
*NL*
found
he
was
not
to
be
seen
;
at
which
he
started
up
,
and
,
without
*NL*
speaking
a
word
,
flew
with
that
swiftness
to
him
that
one
could
scarce
*NL*
perceive
his
feet
to
touch
the
ground
as
he
went
;
but
when
he
came
,
he
*NL*
only
found
he
had
laid
himself
down
to
ease
his
limbs
,
so
Friday
came
*NL*
back
to
me
presently
;
and
then
I
spoke
to
the
Spaniard
to
let
Friday
help
*NL*
him
up
if
he
could
,
and
lead
him
to
the
boat
,
and
then
he
should
carry
*NL*
him
to
our
dwelling
,
where
I
would
take
care
of
him
.
But
Friday
,
a
*NL*
lusty
,
strong
fellow
,
took
the
Spaniard
upon
his
back
,
and
carried
him
*NL*
away
to
the
boat
,
and
set
him
down
softly
upon
the
side
or
gunnel
of
the
*NL*
canoe
,
with
his
feet
in
the
inside
of
it
;
and
then
lifting
him
quite
in
,
*NL*
he
set
him
close
to
his
father
;
and
presently
stepping
out
again
,
*NL*
launched
the
boat
off
,
and
paddled
it
along
the
shore
faster
than
I
could
*NL*
walk
,
though
the
wind
blew
pretty
hard
too
;
so
he
brought
them
both
safe
*NL*
into
our
creek
,
and
leaving
them
in
the
boat
,
ran
away
to
fetch
the
other
*NL*
canoe
.
As
he
passed
me
I
spoke
to
him
,
and
asked
him
whither
he
went
.
*NL*
He
told
me
,
``
Go
fetch
more
boat
;
''
so
away
he
went
like
the
wind
,
for
sure
*NL*
never
man
or
horse
ran
like
him
;
and
he
had
the
other
canoe
in
the
creek
*NL*
almost
as
soon
as
I
got
to
it
by
land
;
so
he
wafted
me
over
,
and
then
*NL*
went
to
help
our
new
guests
out
of
the
boat
,
which
he
did
;
but
they
were
*NL*
neither
of
them
able
to
walk
;
so
that
poor
Friday
knew
not
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
remedy
this
,
I
went
to
work
in
my
thought
,
and
calling
to
Friday
to
*NL*
bid
them
sit
down
on
the
bank
while
he
came
to
me
,
I
soon
made
a
kind
of
*NL*
hand-barrow
to
lay
them
on
,
and
Friday
and
I
carried
them
both
up
*NL*
together
upon
it
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
we
got
them
to
the
outside
of
our
wall
,
or
fortification
,
we
*NL*
were
at
a
worse
loss
than
before
,
for
it
was
impossible
to
get
them
over
,
*NL*
and
I
was
resolved
not
to
break
it
down
;
so
I
set
to
work
again
,
and
*NL*
Friday
and
I
,
in
about
two
hours
'
time
,
made
a
very
handsome
tent
,
*NL*
covered
with
old
sails
,
and
above
that
with
boughs
of
trees
,
being
in
the
*NL*
space
without
our
outward
fence
and
between
that
and
the
grove
of
young
*NL*
wood
which
I
had
planted
;
and
here
we
made
them
two
beds
of
such
things
*NL*
as
I
had
--
viz
.
of
good
rice-straw
,
with
blankets
laid
upon
it
to
lie
on
,
*NL*
and
another
to
cover
them
,
on
each
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
island
was
now
peopled
,
and
I
thought
myself
very
rich
in
subjects
;
*NL*
and
it
was
a
merry
reflection
,
which
I
frequently
made
,
how
like
a
king
I
*NL*
looked
.
First
of
all
,
the
whole
country
was
my
own
property
,
so
that
I
*NL*
had
an
undoubted
right
of
dominion
.
Secondly
,
my
people
were
perfectly
*NL*
subjected
--
I
was
absolutely
lord
and
lawgiver
--
they
all
owed
their
lives
*NL*
to
me
,
and
were
ready
to
lay
down
their
lives
,
if
there
had
been
occasion
*NL*
for
it
,
for
me
.
It
was
remarkable
,
too
,
I
had
but
three
subjects
,
and
*NL*
they
were
of
three
different
religions
--
my
man
Friday
was
a
Protestant
,
*NL*
his
father
was
a
Pagan
and
a
cannibal
,
and
the
Spaniard
was
a
Papist
.
*NL*
However
,
I
allowed
liberty
of
conscience
throughout
my
dominions
.
But
*NL*
this
is
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
had
secured
my
two
weak
,
rescued
prisoners
,
and
given
them
*NL*
shelter
,
and
a
place
to
rest
them
upon
,
I
began
to
think
of
making
some
*NL*
provision
for
them
;
and
the
first
thing
I
did
,
I
ordered
Friday
to
take
a
*NL*
yearling
goat
,
betwixt
a
kid
and
a
goat
,
out
of
my
particular
flock
,
to
*NL*
be
killed
;
when
I
cut
off
the
hinder-quarter
,
and
chopping
it
into
small
*NL*
pieces
,
I
set
Friday
to
work
to
boiling
and
stewing
,
and
made
them
a
very
*NL*
good
dish
,
I
assure
you
,
of
flesh
and
broth
;
and
as
I
cooked
it
without
*NL*
doors
,
for
I
made
no
fire
within
my
inner
wall
,
so
I
carried
it
all
into
*NL*
the
new
tent
,
and
having
set
a
table
there
for
them
,
I
sat
down
,
and
ate
*NL*
my
own
dinner
also
with
them
,
and
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
cheered
them
and
*NL*
encouraged
them
.
Friday
was
my
interpreter
,
especially
to
his
father
,
*NL*
and
,
indeed
,
to
the
Spaniard
too
;
for
the
Spaniard
spoke
the
language
of
*NL*
the
savages
pretty
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
we
had
dined
,
or
rather
supped
,
I
ordered
Friday
to
take
one
of
the
*NL*
canoes
,
and
go
and
fetch
our
muskets
and
other
firearms
,
which
,
for
want
*NL*
of
time
,
we
had
left
upon
the
place
of
battle
;
and
the
next
day
I
ordered
*NL*
him
to
go
and
bury
the
dead
bodies
of
the
savages
,
which
lay
open
to
the
*NL*
sun
,
and
would
presently
be
offensive
.
I
also
ordered
him
to
bury
the
*NL*
horrid
remains
of
their
barbarous
feast
,
which
I
could
not
think
of
doing
*NL*
myself
;
nay
,
I
could
not
bear
to
see
them
if
I
went
that
way
;
all
which
*NL*
he
punctually
performed
,
and
effaced
the
very
appearance
of
the
savages
*NL*
being
there
;
so
that
when
I
went
again
,
I
could
scarce
know
where
it
was
,
*NL*
otherwise
than
by
the
corner
of
the
wood
pointing
to
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
began
to
enter
into
a
little
conversation
with
my
two
new
*NL*
subjects
;
and
,
first
,
I
set
Friday
to
inquire
of
his
father
what
he
*NL*
thought
of
the
escape
of
the
savages
in
that
canoe
,
and
whether
we
might
*NL*
expect
a
return
of
them
,
with
a
power
too
great
for
us
to
resist
.
His
*NL*
first
opinion
was
,
that
the
savages
in
the
boat
never
could
live
out
the
*NL*
storm
which
blew
that
night
they
went
off
,
but
must
of
necessity
be
*NL*
drowned
,
or
driven
south
to
those
other
shores
,
where
they
were
as
sure
*NL*
to
be
devoured
as
they
were
to
be
drowned
if
they
were
cast
away
;
but
,
as
*NL*
to
what
they
would
do
if
they
came
safe
on
shore
,
he
said
he
knew
not
;
*NL*
but
it
was
his
opinion
that
they
were
so
dreadfully
frightened
with
the
*NL*
manner
of
their
being
attacked
,
the
noise
,
and
the
fire
,
that
he
believed
*NL*
they
would
tell
the
people
they
were
all
killed
by
thunder
and
lightning
,
*NL*
not
by
the
hand
of
man
;
and
that
the
two
which
appeared
--
viz
.
Friday
and
*NL*
I
--
were
two
heavenly
spirits
,
or
furies
,
come
down
to
destroy
them
,
and
*NL*
not
men
with
weapons
.
This
,
he
said
,
he
knew
;
because
he
heard
them
all
*NL*
cry
out
so
,
in
their
language
,
one
to
another
;
for
it
was
impossible
for
*NL*
them
to
conceive
that
a
man
could
dart
fire
,
and
speak
thunder
,
and
kill
*NL*
at
a
distance
,
without
lifting
up
the
hand
,
as
was
done
now
:
and
this
old
*NL*
savage
was
in
the
right
;
for
,
as
I
understood
since
,
by
other
hands
,
the
*NL*
savages
never
attempted
to
go
over
to
the
island
afterwards
,
they
were
so
*NL*
terrified
with
the
accounts
given
by
those
four
men
-LRB-
for
it
seems
they
*NL*
did
escape
the
sea
-RRB-
,
that
they
believed
whoever
went
to
that
enchanted
*NL*
island
would
be
destroyed
with
fire
from
the
gods
.
This
,
however
,
I
knew
*NL*
not
;
and
therefore
was
under
continual
apprehensions
for
a
good
while
,
*NL*
and
kept
always
upon
my
guard
,
with
all
my
army
:
for
,
as
there
were
now
*NL*
four
of
us
,
I
would
have
ventured
upon
a
hundred
of
them
,
fairly
in
the
*NL*
open
field
,
at
any
time
.

CHAPTER
XVII
--
VISIT
OF
MUTINEERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
little
time
,
however
,
no
more
canoes
appearing
,
the
fear
of
their
*NL*
coming
wore
off
;
and
I
began
to
take
my
former
thoughts
of
a
voyage
to
*NL*
the
main
into
consideration
;
being
likewise
assured
by
Friday
's
father
*NL*
that
I
might
depend
upon
good
usage
from
their
nation
,
on
his
account
,
if
*NL*
I
would
go
.
But
my
thoughts
were
a
little
suspended
when
I
had
a
serious
*NL*
discourse
with
the
Spaniard
,
and
when
I
understood
that
there
were
*NL*
sixteen
more
of
his
countrymen
and
Portuguese
,
who
having
been
cast
away
*NL*
and
made
their
escape
to
that
side
,
lived
there
at
peace
,
indeed
,
with
*NL*
the
savages
,
but
were
very
sore
put
to
it
for
necessaries
,
and
,
indeed
,
*NL*
for
life
.
I
asked
him
all
the
particulars
of
their
voyage
,
and
found
*NL*
they
were
a
Spanish
ship
,
bound
from
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
to
the
Havanna
,
*NL*
being
directed
to
leave
their
loading
there
,
which
was
chiefly
hides
and
*NL*
silver
,
and
to
bring
back
what
European
goods
they
could
meet
with
there
;
*NL*
that
they
had
five
Portuguese
seamen
on
board
,
whom
they
took
out
of
*NL*
another
wreck
;
that
five
of
their
own
men
were
drowned
when
first
the
*NL*
ship
was
lost
,
and
that
these
escaped
through
infinite
dangers
and
*NL*
hazards
,
and
arrived
,
almost
starved
,
on
the
cannibal
coast
,
where
they
*NL*
expected
to
have
been
devoured
every
moment
.
He
told
me
they
had
some
*NL*
arms
with
them
,
but
they
were
perfectly
useless
,
for
that
they
had
*NL*
neither
powder
nor
ball
,
the
washing
of
the
sea
having
spoiled
all
their
*NL*
powder
but
a
little
,
which
they
used
at
their
first
landing
to
provide
*NL*
themselves
with
some
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
would
become
of
them
there
,
and
if
they
had
*NL*
formed
any
design
of
making
their
escape
.
He
said
they
had
many
*NL*
consultations
about
it
;
but
that
having
neither
vessel
nor
tools
to
build
*NL*
one
,
nor
provisions
of
any
kind
,
their
councils
always
ended
in
tears
and
*NL*
despair
.
I
asked
him
how
he
thought
they
would
receive
a
proposal
from
*NL*
me
,
which
might
tend
towards
an
escape
;
and
whether
,
if
they
were
all
*NL*
here
,
it
might
not
be
done
.
I
told
him
with
freedom
,
I
feared
mostly
*NL*
their
treachery
and
ill-usage
of
me
,
if
I
put
my
life
in
their
hands
;
for
*NL*
that
gratitude
was
no
inherent
virtue
in
the
nature
of
man
,
nor
did
men
*NL*
always
square
their
dealings
by
the
obligations
they
had
received
so
much
*NL*
as
they
did
by
the
advantages
they
expected
.
I
told
him
it
would
be
very
*NL*
hard
that
I
should
be
made
the
instrument
of
their
deliverance
,
and
that
*NL*
they
should
afterwards
make
me
their
prisoner
in
New
Spain
,
where
an
*NL*
Englishman
was
certain
to
be
made
a
sacrifice
,
what
necessity
or
what
*NL*
accident
soever
brought
him
thither
;
and
that
I
had
rather
be
delivered
*NL*
up
to
the
savages
,
and
be
devoured
alive
,
than
fall
into
the
merciless
*NL*
claws
of
the
priests
,
and
be
carried
into
the
Inquisition
.
I
added
that
,
*NL*
otherwise
,
I
was
persuaded
,
if
they
were
all
here
,
we
might
,
with
so
many
*NL*
hands
,
build
a
barque
large
enough
to
carry
us
all
away
,
either
to
the
*NL*
Brazils
southward
,
or
to
the
islands
or
Spanish
coast
northward
;
but
that
*NL*
if
,
in
requital
,
they
should
,
when
I
had
put
weapons
into
their
hands
,
*NL*
carry
me
by
force
among
their
own
people
,
I
might
be
ill-used
for
my
*NL*
kindness
to
them
,
and
make
my
case
worse
than
it
was
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
,
with
a
great
deal
of
candour
and
ingenuousness
,
that
their
*NL*
condition
was
so
miserable
,
and
that
they
were
so
sensible
of
it
,
that
he
*NL*
believed
they
would
abhor
the
thought
of
using
any
man
unkindly
that
*NL*
should
contribute
to
their
deliverance
;
and
that
,
if
I
pleased
,
he
would
*NL*
go
to
them
with
the
old
man
,
and
discourse
with
them
about
it
,
and
return
*NL*
again
and
bring
me
their
answer
;
that
he
would
make
conditions
with
them
*NL*
upon
their
solemn
oath
,
that
they
should
be
absolutely
under
my
direction
*NL*
as
their
commander
and
captain
;
and
they
should
swear
upon
the
holy
*NL*
sacraments
and
gospel
to
be
true
to
me
,
and
go
to
such
Christian
country
*NL*
as
I
should
agree
to
,
and
no
other
;
and
to
be
directed
wholly
and
*NL*
absolutely
by
my
orders
till
they
were
landed
safely
in
such
country
as
I
*NL*
intended
,
and
that
he
would
bring
a
contract
from
them
,
under
their
*NL*
hands
,
for
that
purpose
.
Then
he
told
me
he
would
first
swear
to
me
*NL*
himself
that
he
would
never
stir
from
me
as
long
as
he
lived
till
I
gave
*NL*
him
orders
;
and
that
he
would
take
my
side
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
,
*NL*
if
there
should
happen
the
least
breach
of
faith
among
his
countrymen
.
*NL*
He
told
me
they
were
all
of
them
very
civil
,
honest
men
,
and
they
were
*NL*
under
the
greatest
distress
imaginable
,
having
neither
weapons
nor
*NL*
clothes
,
nor
any
food
,
but
at
the
mercy
and
discretion
of
the
savages
;
*NL*
out
of
all
hopes
of
ever
returning
to
their
own
country
;
and
that
he
was
*NL*
sure
,
if
I
would
undertake
their
relief
,
they
would
live
and
die
by
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
these
assurances
,
I
resolved
to
venture
to
relieve
them
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
and
to
send
the
old
savage
and
this
Spaniard
over
to
them
to
*NL*
treat
.
But
when
we
had
got
all
things
in
readiness
to
go
,
the
Spaniard
*NL*
himself
started
an
objection
,
which
had
so
much
prudence
in
it
on
one
*NL*
hand
,
and
so
much
sincerity
on
the
other
hand
,
that
I
could
not
but
be
*NL*
very
well
satisfied
in
it
;
and
,
by
his
advice
,
put
off
the
deliverance
of
*NL*
his
comrades
for
at
least
half
a
year
.
The
case
was
thus
:
he
had
been
*NL*
with
us
now
about
a
month
,
during
which
time
I
had
let
him
see
in
what
*NL*
manner
I
had
provided
,
with
the
assistance
of
Providence
,
for
my
support
;
*NL*
and
he
saw
evidently
what
stock
of
corn
and
rice
I
had
laid
up
;
which
,
*NL*
though
it
was
more
than
sufficient
for
myself
,
yet
it
was
not
sufficient
,
*NL*
without
good
husbandry
,
for
my
family
,
now
it
was
increased
to
four
;
but
*NL*
much
less
would
it
be
sufficient
if
his
countrymen
,
who
were
,
as
he
said
,
*NL*
sixteen
,
still
alive
,
should
come
over
;
and
least
of
all
would
it
be
*NL*
sufficient
to
victual
our
vessel
,
if
we
should
build
one
,
for
a
voyage
to
*NL*
any
of
the
Christian
colonies
of
America
;
so
he
told
me
he
thought
it
*NL*
would
be
more
advisable
to
let
him
and
the
other
two
dig
and
cultivate
*NL*
some
more
land
,
as
much
as
I
could
spare
seed
to
sow
,
and
that
we
should
*NL*
wait
another
harvest
,
that
we
might
have
a
supply
of
corn
for
his
*NL*
countrymen
,
when
they
should
come
;
for
want
might
be
a
temptation
to
them
*NL*
to
disagree
,
or
not
to
think
themselves
delivered
,
otherwise
than
out
of
*NL*
one
difficulty
into
another
.
``
You
know
,
''
says
he
,
``
the
children
of
*NL*
Israel
,
though
they
rejoiced
at
first
for
their
being
delivered
out
of
*NL*
Egypt
,
yet
rebelled
even
against
God
Himself
,
that
delivered
them
,
when
*NL*
they
came
to
want
bread
in
the
wilderness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
caution
was
so
seasonable
,
and
his
advice
so
good
,
that
I
could
not
*NL*
but
be
very
well
pleased
with
his
proposal
,
as
well
as
I
was
satisfied
*NL*
with
his
fidelity
;
so
we
fell
to
digging
,
all
four
of
us
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
wooden
tools
we
were
furnished
with
permitted
;
and
in
about
a
month
's
*NL*
time
,
by
the
end
of
which
it
was
seed-time
,
we
had
got
as
much
land
cured
*NL*
and
trimmed
up
as
we
sowed
two-and-twenty
bushels
of
barley
on
,
and
*NL*
sixteen
jars
of
rice
,
which
was
,
in
short
,
all
the
seed
we
had
to
spare
:
*NL*
indeed
,
we
left
ourselves
barely
sufficient
,
for
our
own
food
for
the
six
*NL*
months
that
we
had
to
expect
our
crop
;
that
is
to
say
reckoning
from
the
*NL*
time
we
set
our
seed
aside
for
sowing
;
for
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
it
is
*NL*
six
months
in
the
ground
in
that
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
now
society
enough
,
and
our
numbers
being
sufficient
to
put
us
out
*NL*
of
fear
of
the
savages
,
if
they
had
come
,
unless
their
number
had
been
*NL*
very
great
,
we
went
freely
all
over
the
island
,
whenever
we
found
*NL*
occasion
;
and
as
we
had
our
escape
or
deliverance
upon
our
thoughts
,
it
*NL*
was
impossible
,
at
least
for
me
,
to
have
the
means
of
it
out
of
mine
.
*NL*
For
this
purpose
I
marked
out
several
trees
,
which
I
thought
fit
for
our
*NL*
work
,
and
I
set
Friday
and
his
father
to
cut
them
down
;
and
then
I
caused
*NL*
the
Spaniard
,
to
whom
I
imparted
my
thoughts
on
that
affair
,
to
oversee
*NL*
and
direct
their
work
.
I
showed
them
with
what
indefatigable
pains
I
had
*NL*
hewed
a
large
tree
into
single
planks
,
and
I
caused
them
to
do
the
like
,
*NL*
till
they
made
about
a
dozen
large
planks
,
of
good
oak
,
near
two
feet
*NL*
broad
,
thirty-five
feet
long
,
and
from
two
inches
to
four
inches
thick
:
*NL*
what
prodigious
labour
it
took
up
any
one
may
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
I
contrived
to
increase
my
little
flock
of
tame
goats
as
*NL*
much
as
I
could
;
and
for
this
purpose
I
made
Friday
and
the
Spaniard
go
*NL*
out
one
day
,
and
myself
with
Friday
the
next
day
-LRB-
for
we
took
our
turns
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
by
this
means
we
got
about
twenty
young
kids
to
breed
up
with
the
*NL*
rest
;
for
whenever
we
shot
the
dam
,
we
saved
the
kids
,
and
added
them
to
*NL*
our
flock
.
But
above
all
,
the
season
for
curing
the
grapes
coming
on
,
I
*NL*
caused
such
a
prodigious
quantity
to
be
hung
up
in
the
sun
,
that
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
had
we
been
at
Alicant
,
where
the
raisins
of
the
sun
are
cured
,
*NL*
we
could
have
filled
sixty
or
eighty
barrels
;
and
these
,
with
our
bread
,
*NL*
formed
a
great
part
of
our
food
--
very
good
living
too
,
I
assure
you
,
for
*NL*
they
are
exceedingly
nourishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
harvest
,
and
our
crop
in
good
order
:
it
was
not
the
most
*NL*
plentiful
increase
I
had
seen
in
the
island
,
but
,
however
,
it
was
enough
*NL*
to
answer
our
end
;
for
from
twenty-two
bushels
of
barley
we
brought
in
*NL*
and
thrashed
out
above
two
hundred
and
twenty
bushels
;
and
the
like
in
*NL*
proportion
of
the
rice
;
which
was
store
enough
for
our
food
to
the
next
*NL*
harvest
,
though
all
the
sixteen
Spaniards
had
been
on
shore
with
me
;
or
,
*NL*
if
we
had
been
ready
for
a
voyage
,
it
would
very
plentifully
have
*NL*
victualled
our
ship
to
have
carried
us
to
any
part
of
the
world
;
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
any
part
of
America
.
When
we
had
thus
housed
and
secured
our
*NL*
magazine
of
corn
,
we
fell
to
work
to
make
more
wicker-ware
,
viz
.
great
*NL*
baskets
,
in
which
we
kept
it
;
and
the
Spaniard
was
very
handy
and
*NL*
dexterous
at
this
part
,
and
often
blamed
me
that
I
did
not
make
some
*NL*
things
for
defence
of
this
kind
of
work
;
but
I
saw
no
need
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
having
a
full
supply
of
food
for
all
the
guests
I
expected
,
I
*NL*
gave
the
Spaniard
leave
to
go
over
to
the
main
,
to
see
what
he
could
do
*NL*
with
those
he
had
left
behind
him
there
.
I
gave
him
a
strict
charge
not
*NL*
to
bring
any
man
who
would
not
first
swear
in
the
presence
of
himself
and
*NL*
the
old
savage
that
he
would
in
no
way
injure
,
fight
with
,
or
attack
the
*NL*
person
he
should
find
in
the
island
,
who
was
so
kind
as
to
send
for
them
*NL*
in
order
to
their
deliverance
;
but
that
they
would
stand
by
him
and
*NL*
defend
him
against
all
such
attempts
,
and
wherever
they
went
would
be
*NL*
entirely
under
and
subjected
to
his
command
;
and
that
this
should
be
put
*NL*
in
writing
,
and
signed
in
their
hands
.
How
they
were
to
have
done
this
,
*NL*
when
I
knew
they
had
neither
pen
nor
ink
,
was
a
question
which
we
never
*NL*
asked
.
Under
these
instructions
,
the
Spaniard
and
the
old
savage
,
the
*NL*
father
of
Friday
,
went
away
in
one
of
the
canoes
which
they
might
be
said
*NL*
to
have
come
in
,
or
rather
were
brought
in
,
when
they
came
as
prisoners
*NL*
to
be
devoured
by
the
savages
.
I
gave
each
of
them
a
musket
,
with
a
*NL*
firelock
on
it
,
and
about
eight
charges
of
powder
and
ball
,
charging
them
*NL*
to
be
very
good
husbands
of
both
,
and
not
to
use
either
of
them
but
upon
*NL*
urgent
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
cheerful
work
,
being
the
first
measures
used
by
me
in
view
of
*NL*
my
deliverance
for
now
twenty-seven
years
and
some
days
.
I
gave
them
*NL*
provisions
of
bread
and
of
dried
grapes
,
sufficient
for
themselves
for
*NL*
many
days
,
and
sufficient
for
all
the
Spaniards
--
for
about
eight
days
'
*NL*
time
;
and
wishing
them
a
good
voyage
,
I
saw
them
go
,
agreeing
with
them
*NL*
about
a
signal
they
should
hang
out
at
their
return
,
by
which
I
should
*NL*
know
them
again
when
they
came
back
,
at
a
distance
,
before
they
came
on
*NL*
shore
.
They
went
away
with
a
fair
gale
on
the
day
that
the
moon
was
at
*NL*
full
,
by
my
account
in
the
month
of
October
;
but
as
for
an
exact
*NL*
reckoning
of
days
,
after
I
had
once
lost
it
I
could
never
recover
it
*NL*
again
;
nor
had
I
kept
even
the
number
of
years
so
punctually
as
to
be
*NL*
sure
I
was
right
;
though
,
as
it
proved
when
I
afterwards
examined
my
*NL*
account
,
I
found
I
had
kept
a
true
reckoning
of
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
less
than
eight
days
I
had
waited
for
them
,
when
a
strange
and
*NL*
unforeseen
accident
intervened
,
of
which
the
like
has
not
,
perhaps
,
been
*NL*
heard
of
in
history
.
I
was
fast
asleep
in
my
hutch
one
morning
,
when
my
*NL*
man
Friday
came
running
in
to
me
,
and
called
aloud
,
``
Master
,
master
,
they
*NL*
are
come
,
they
are
come
!
''
I
jumped
up
,
and
regardless
of
danger
I
went
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
could
get
my
clothes
on
,
through
my
little
grove
,
which
,
by
*NL*
the
way
,
was
by
this
time
grown
to
be
a
very
thick
wood
;
I
say
,
*NL*
regardless
of
danger
I
went
without
my
arms
,
which
was
not
my
custom
to
*NL*
do
;
but
I
was
surprised
when
,
turning
my
eyes
to
the
sea
,
I
presently
saw
*NL*
a
boat
at
about
a
league
and
a
half
distance
,
standing
in
for
the
shore
,
*NL*
with
a
shoulder-of-mutton
sail
,
as
they
call
it
,
and
the
wind
blowing
*NL*
pretty
fair
to
bring
them
in
:
also
I
observed
,
presently
,
that
they
did
*NL*
not
come
from
that
side
which
the
shore
lay
on
,
but
from
the
southernmost
*NL*
end
of
the
island
.
Upon
this
I
called
Friday
in
,
and
bade
him
lie
close
,
*NL*
for
these
were
not
the
people
we
looked
for
,
and
that
we
might
not
know
*NL*
yet
whether
they
were
friends
or
enemies
.
In
the
next
place
I
went
in
to
*NL*
fetch
my
perspective
glass
to
see
what
I
could
make
of
them
;
and
having
*NL*
taken
the
ladder
out
,
I
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
as
I
used
to
*NL*
do
when
I
was
apprehensive
of
anything
,
and
to
take
my
view
the
plainer
*NL*
without
being
discovered
.
I
had
scarce
set
my
foot
upon
the
hill
when
my
*NL*
eye
plainly
discovered
a
ship
lying
at
anchor
,
at
about
two
leagues
and
a
*NL*
half
distance
from
me
,
SSE.
,
but
not
above
a
league
and
a
half
from
the
*NL*
shore
.
By
my
observation
it
appeared
plainly
to
be
an
English
ship
,
and
*NL*
the
boat
appeared
to
be
an
English
long-boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
express
the
confusion
I
was
in
,
though
the
joy
of
seeing
a
ship
,
*NL*
and
one
that
I
had
reason
to
believe
was
manned
by
my
own
countrymen
,
and
*NL*
consequently
friends
,
was
such
as
I
can
not
describe
;
but
yet
I
had
some
*NL*
secret
doubts
hung
about
me
--
I
can
not
tell
from
whence
they
came
--
bidding
*NL*
me
keep
upon
my
guard
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
occurred
to
me
to
consider
*NL*
what
business
an
English
ship
could
have
in
that
part
of
the
world
,
since
*NL*
it
was
not
the
way
to
or
from
any
part
of
the
world
where
the
English
had
*NL*
any
traffic
;
and
I
knew
there
had
been
no
storms
to
drive
them
in
there
*NL*
in
distress
;
and
that
if
they
were
really
English
it
was
most
probable
*NL*
that
they
were
here
upon
no
good
design
;
and
that
I
had
better
continue
*NL*
as
I
was
than
fall
into
the
hands
of
thieves
and
murderers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
no
man
despise
the
secret
hints
and
notices
of
danger
which
sometimes
*NL*
are
given
him
when
he
may
think
there
is
no
possibility
of
its
being
*NL*
real
.
That
such
hints
and
notices
are
given
us
I
believe
few
that
have
*NL*
made
any
observation
of
things
can
deny
;
that
they
are
certain
*NL*
discoveries
of
an
invisible
world
,
and
a
converse
of
spirits
,
we
can
not
*NL*
doubt
;
and
if
the
tendency
of
them
seems
to
be
to
warn
us
of
danger
,
why
*NL*
should
we
not
suppose
they
are
from
some
friendly
agent
-LRB-
whether
supreme
,
*NL*
or
inferior
and
subordinate
,
is
not
the
question
-RRB-
,
and
that
they
are
*NL*
given
for
our
good
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
present
question
abundantly
confirms
me
in
the
justice
of
this
*NL*
reasoning
;
for
had
I
not
been
made
cautious
by
this
secret
admonition
,
*NL*
come
it
from
whence
it
will
,
I
had
been
done
inevitably
,
and
in
a
far
*NL*
worse
condition
than
before
,
as
you
will
see
presently
.
I
had
not
kept
*NL*
myself
long
in
this
posture
till
I
saw
the
boat
draw
near
the
shore
,
as
*NL*
if
they
looked
for
a
creek
to
thrust
in
at
,
for
the
convenience
of
*NL*
landing
;
however
,
as
they
did
not
come
quite
far
enough
,
they
did
not
see
*NL*
the
little
inlet
where
I
formerly
landed
my
rafts
,
but
ran
their
boat
on
*NL*
shore
upon
the
beach
,
at
about
half
a
mile
from
me
,
which
was
very
happy
*NL*
for
me
;
for
otherwise
they
would
have
landed
just
at
my
door
,
as
I
may
*NL*
say
,
and
would
soon
have
beaten
me
out
of
my
castle
,
and
perhaps
have
*NL*
plundered
me
of
all
I
had
.
When
they
were
on
shore
I
was
fully
satisfied
*NL*
they
were
Englishmen
,
at
least
most
of
them
;
one
or
two
I
thought
were
*NL*
Dutch
,
but
it
did
not
prove
so
;
there
were
in
all
eleven
men
,
whereof
*NL*
three
of
them
I
found
were
unarmed
and
,
as
I
thought
,
bound
;
and
when
the
*NL*
first
four
or
five
of
them
were
jumped
on
shore
,
they
took
those
three
*NL*
out
of
the
boat
as
prisoners
:
one
of
the
three
I
could
perceive
using
the
*NL*
most
passionate
gestures
of
entreaty
,
affliction
,
and
despair
,
even
to
a
*NL*
kind
of
extravagance
;
the
other
two
,
I
could
perceive
,
lifted
up
their
*NL*
hands
sometimes
,
and
appeared
concerned
indeed
,
but
not
to
such
a
degree
*NL*
as
the
first
.
I
was
perfectly
confounded
at
the
sight
,
and
knew
not
what
*NL*
the
meaning
of
it
should
be
.
Friday
called
out
to
me
in
English
,
as
well
*NL*
as
he
could
,
``
O
master
!
you
see
English
mans
eat
prisoner
as
well
as
*NL*
savage
mans
.
''
``
Why
,
Friday
,
''
says
I
,
``
do
you
think
they
are
going
to
eat
*NL*
them
,
then
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
says
Friday
,
``
they
will
eat
them
.
''
``
No
no
,
''
says
I
,
*NL*
``
Friday
;
I
am
afraid
they
will
murder
them
,
indeed
;
but
you
may
be
sure
*NL*
they
will
not
eat
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
I
had
no
thought
of
what
the
matter
really
was
,
but
stood
*NL*
trembling
with
the
horror
of
the
sight
,
expecting
every
moment
when
the
*NL*
three
prisoners
should
be
killed
;
nay
,
once
I
saw
one
of
the
villains
*NL*
lift
up
his
arm
with
a
great
cutlass
,
as
the
seamen
call
it
,
or
sword
,
to
*NL*
strike
one
of
the
poor
men
;
and
I
expected
to
see
him
fall
every
moment
;
*NL*
at
which
all
the
blood
in
my
body
seemed
to
run
chill
in
my
veins
.
I
*NL*
wished
heartily
now
for
the
Spaniard
,
and
the
savage
that
had
gone
with
*NL*
him
,
or
that
I
had
any
way
to
have
come
undiscovered
within
shot
of
them
,
*NL*
that
I
might
have
secured
the
three
men
,
for
I
saw
no
firearms
they
had
*NL*
among
them
;
but
it
fell
out
to
my
mind
another
way
.
After
I
had
observed
*NL*
the
outrageous
usage
of
the
three
men
by
the
insolent
seamen
,
I
observed
*NL*
the
fellows
run
scattering
about
the
island
,
as
if
they
wanted
to
see
the
*NL*
country
.
I
observed
that
the
three
other
men
had
liberty
to
go
also
*NL*
where
they
pleased
;
but
they
sat
down
all
three
upon
the
ground
,
very
*NL*
pensive
,
and
looked
like
men
in
despair
.
This
put
me
in
mind
of
the
*NL*
first
time
when
I
came
on
shore
,
and
began
to
look
about
me
;
how
I
gave
*NL*
myself
over
for
lost
;
how
wildly
I
looked
round
me
;
what
dreadful
*NL*
apprehensions
I
had
;
and
how
I
lodged
in
the
tree
all
night
for
fear
of
*NL*
being
devoured
by
wild
beasts
.
As
I
knew
nothing
that
night
of
the
*NL*
supply
I
was
to
receive
by
the
providential
driving
of
the
ship
nearer
*NL*
the
land
by
the
storms
and
tide
,
by
which
I
have
since
been
so
long
*NL*
nourished
and
supported
;
so
these
three
poor
desolate
men
knew
nothing
*NL*
how
certain
of
deliverance
and
supply
they
were
,
how
near
it
was
to
them
,
*NL*
and
how
effectually
and
really
they
were
in
a
condition
of
safety
,
at
the
*NL*
same
time
that
they
thought
themselves
lost
and
their
case
desperate
.
So
*NL*
little
do
we
see
before
us
in
the
world
,
and
so
much
reason
have
we
to
*NL*
depend
cheerfully
upon
the
great
Maker
of
the
world
,
that
He
does
not
*NL*
leave
His
creatures
so
absolutely
destitute
,
but
that
in
the
worst
*NL*
circumstances
they
have
always
something
to
be
thankful
for
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
are
nearer
deliverance
than
they
imagine
;
nay
,
are
even
brought
*NL*
to
their
deliverance
by
the
means
by
which
they
seem
to
be
brought
to
*NL*
their
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
at
high-water
when
these
people
came
on
shore
;
and
while
they
*NL*
rambled
about
to
see
what
kind
of
a
place
they
were
in
,
they
had
*NL*
carelessly
stayed
till
the
tide
was
spent
,
and
the
water
was
ebbed
*NL*
considerably
away
,
leaving
their
boat
aground
.
They
had
left
two
men
in
*NL*
the
boat
,
who
,
as
I
found
afterwards
,
having
drunk
a
little
too
much
*NL*
brandy
,
fell
asleep
;
however
,
one
of
them
waking
a
little
sooner
than
the
*NL*
other
and
finding
the
boat
too
fast
aground
for
him
to
stir
it
,
hallooed
*NL*
out
for
the
rest
,
who
were
straggling
about
:
upon
which
they
all
soon
*NL*
came
to
the
boat
:
but
it
was
past
all
their
strength
to
launch
her
,
the
*NL*
boat
being
very
heavy
,
and
the
shore
on
that
side
being
a
soft
oozy
sand
,
*NL*
almost
like
a
quicksand
.
In
this
condition
,
like
true
seamen
,
who
are
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
the
least
of
all
mankind
given
to
forethought
,
they
gave
it
*NL*
over
,
and
away
they
strolled
about
the
country
again
;
and
I
heard
one
of
*NL*
them
say
aloud
to
another
,
calling
them
off
from
the
boat
,
``
Why
,
let
her
*NL*
alone
,
Jack
,
ca
n't
you
?
she
'll
float
next
tide
;
''
by
which
I
was
fully
*NL*
confirmed
in
the
main
inquiry
of
what
countrymen
they
were
.
All
this
*NL*
while
I
kept
myself
very
close
,
not
once
daring
to
stir
out
of
my
castle
*NL*
any
farther
than
to
my
place
of
observation
near
the
top
of
the
hill
:
and
*NL*
very
glad
I
was
to
think
how
well
it
was
fortified
.
I
knew
it
was
no
*NL*
less
than
ten
hours
before
the
boat
could
float
again
,
and
by
that
time
*NL*
it
would
be
dark
,
and
I
might
be
at
more
liberty
to
see
their
motions
,
*NL*
and
to
hear
their
discourse
,
if
they
had
any
.
In
the
meantime
I
fitted
*NL*
myself
up
for
a
battle
as
before
,
though
with
more
caution
,
knowing
I
had
*NL*
to
do
with
another
kind
of
enemy
than
I
had
at
first
.
I
ordered
Friday
*NL*
also
,
whom
I
had
made
an
excellent
marksman
with
his
gun
,
to
load
himself
*NL*
with
arms
.
I
took
myself
two
fowling-pieces
,
and
I
gave
him
three
*NL*
muskets
.
My
figure
,
indeed
,
was
very
fierce
;
I
had
my
formidable
*NL*
goat-skin
coat
on
,
with
the
great
cap
I
have
mentioned
,
a
naked
sword
by
*NL*
my
side
,
two
pistols
in
my
belt
,
and
a
gun
upon
each
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
my
design
,
as
I
said
above
,
not
to
have
made
any
attempt
till
it
*NL*
was
dark
;
but
about
two
o'clock
,
being
the
heat
of
the
day
,
I
found
that
*NL*
they
were
all
gone
straggling
into
the
woods
,
and
,
as
I
thought
,
laid
*NL*
down
to
sleep
.
The
three
poor
distressed
men
,
too
anxious
for
their
*NL*
condition
to
get
any
sleep
,
had
,
however
,
sat
down
under
the
shelter
of
a
*NL*
great
tree
,
at
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
me
,
and
,
as
I
thought
,
out
*NL*
of
sight
of
any
of
the
rest
.
Upon
this
I
resolved
to
discover
myself
to
*NL*
them
,
and
learn
something
of
their
condition
;
immediately
I
marched
as
*NL*
above
,
my
man
Friday
at
a
good
distance
behind
me
,
as
formidable
for
his
*NL*
arms
as
I
,
but
not
making
quite
so
staring
a
spectre-like
figure
as
I
*NL*
did
.
I
came
as
near
them
undiscovered
as
I
could
,
and
then
,
before
any
*NL*
of
them
saw
me
,
I
called
aloud
to
them
in
Spanish
,
``
What
are
ye
,
*NL*
gentlemen
?
''
They
started
up
at
the
noise
,
but
were
ten
times
more
*NL*
confounded
when
they
saw
me
,
and
the
uncouth
figure
that
I
made
.
They
*NL*
made
no
answer
at
all
,
but
I
thought
I
perceived
them
just
going
to
fly
*NL*
from
me
,
when
I
spoke
to
them
in
English
.
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
I
,
``
do
not
be
*NL*
surprised
at
me
;
perhaps
you
may
have
a
friend
near
when
you
did
not
*NL*
expect
it
.
''
``
He
must
be
sent
directly
from
heaven
then
,
''
said
one
of
*NL*
them
very
gravely
to
me
,
and
pulling
off
his
hat
at
the
same
time
to
me
;
*NL*
``
for
our
condition
is
past
the
help
of
man
.
''
``
All
help
is
from
heaven
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
can
you
put
a
stranger
in
the
way
to
help
you
?
for
you
*NL*
seem
to
be
in
some
great
distress
.
I
saw
you
when
you
landed
;
and
when
*NL*
you
seemed
to
make
application
to
the
brutes
that
came
with
you
,
I
saw
*NL*
one
of
them
lift
up
his
sword
to
kill
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
man
,
with
tears
running
down
his
face
,
and
trembling
,
looking
*NL*
like
one
astonished
,
returned
,
``
Am
I
talking
to
God
or
man
?
Is
it
a
real
*NL*
man
or
an
angel
?
''
``
Be
in
no
fear
about
that
,
sir
,
''
said
I
;
``
if
God
had
*NL*
sent
an
angel
to
relieve
you
,
he
would
have
come
better
clothed
,
and
*NL*
armed
after
another
manner
than
you
see
me
;
pray
lay
aside
your
fears
;
I
*NL*
am
a
man
,
an
Englishman
,
and
disposed
to
assist
you
;
you
see
I
have
one
*NL*
servant
only
;
we
have
arms
and
ammunition
;
tell
us
freely
,
can
we
serve
*NL*
you
?
What
is
your
case
?
''
``
Our
case
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
too
long
to
tell
*NL*
you
while
our
murderers
are
so
near
us
;
but
,
in
short
,
sir
,
I
was
*NL*
commander
of
that
ship
--
my
men
have
mutinied
against
me
;
they
have
been
*NL*
hardly
prevailed
on
not
to
murder
me
,
and
,
at
last
,
have
set
me
on
shore
*NL*
in
this
desolate
place
,
with
these
two
men
with
me
--
one
my
mate
,
the
*NL*
other
a
passenger
--
where
we
expected
to
perish
,
believing
the
place
to
be
*NL*
uninhabited
,
and
know
not
yet
what
to
think
of
it
.
''
``
Where
are
these
*NL*
brutes
,
your
enemies
?
''
said
I
;
``
do
you
know
where
they
are
gone
?
There
*NL*
they
lie
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
pointing
to
a
thicket
of
trees
;
``
my
heart
*NL*
trembles
for
fear
they
have
seen
us
and
heard
you
speak
;
if
they
have
,
*NL*
they
will
certainly
murder
us
all
.
''
``
Have
they
any
firearms
?
''
said
I
.
*NL*
He
answered
,
``
They
had
only
two
pieces
,
one
of
which
they
left
in
the
*NL*
boat
.
''
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
I
,
``
leave
the
rest
to
me
;
I
see
they
are
all
*NL*
asleep
;
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
kill
them
all
;
but
shall
we
rather
take
*NL*
them
prisoners
?
''
He
told
me
there
were
two
desperate
villains
among
them
*NL*
that
it
was
scarce
safe
to
show
any
mercy
to
;
but
if
they
were
secured
,
*NL*
he
believed
all
the
rest
would
return
to
their
duty
.
I
asked
him
which
*NL*
they
were
.
He
told
me
he
could
not
at
that
distance
distinguish
them
,
*NL*
but
he
would
obey
my
orders
in
anything
I
would
direct
.
``
Well
,
''
says
I
,
*NL*
``
let
us
retreat
out
of
their
view
or
hearing
,
lest
they
awake
,
and
we
*NL*
will
resolve
further
.
''
So
they
willingly
went
back
with
me
,
till
the
*NL*
woods
covered
us
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
you
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
I
venture
upon
your
deliverance
,
are
you
*NL*
willing
to
make
two
conditions
with
me
?
''
He
anticipated
my
proposals
by
*NL*
telling
me
that
both
he
and
the
ship
,
if
recovered
,
should
be
wholly
*NL*
directed
and
commanded
by
me
in
everything
;
and
if
the
ship
was
not
*NL*
recovered
,
he
would
live
and
die
with
me
in
what
part
of
the
world
soever
*NL*
I
would
send
him
;
and
the
two
other
men
said
the
same
.
``
Well
,
''
says
I
,
*NL*
``
my
conditions
are
but
two
;
first
,
that
while
you
stay
in
this
island
*NL*
with
me
,
you
will
not
pretend
to
any
authority
here
;
and
if
I
put
arms
in
*NL*
your
hands
,
you
will
,
upon
all
occasions
,
give
them
up
to
me
,
and
do
no
*NL*
prejudice
to
me
or
mine
upon
this
island
,
and
in
the
meantime
be
governed
*NL*
by
my
orders
;
secondly
,
that
if
the
ship
is
or
may
be
recovered
,
you
will
*NL*
carry
me
and
my
man
to
England
passage
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
all
the
assurances
that
the
invention
or
faith
of
man
could
*NL*
devise
that
he
would
comply
with
these
most
reasonable
demands
,
and
*NL*
besides
would
owe
his
life
to
me
,
and
acknowledge
it
upon
all
occasions
*NL*
as
long
as
he
lived
.
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
I
,
``
here
are
three
muskets
for
*NL*
you
,
with
powder
and
ball
;
tell
me
next
what
you
think
is
proper
to
be
*NL*
done
.
''
He
showed
all
the
testimonies
of
his
gratitude
that
he
was
able
,
*NL*
but
offered
to
be
wholly
guided
by
me
.
I
told
him
I
thought
it
was
very
*NL*
hard
venturing
anything
;
but
the
best
method
I
could
think
of
was
to
fire
*NL*
on
them
at
once
as
they
lay
,
and
if
any
were
not
killed
at
the
first
*NL*
volley
,
and
offered
to
submit
,
we
might
save
them
,
and
so
put
it
wholly
*NL*
upon
God
's
providence
to
direct
the
shot
.
He
said
,
very
modestly
,
that
*NL*
he
was
loath
to
kill
them
if
he
could
help
it
;
but
that
those
two
were
*NL*
incorrigible
villains
,
and
had
been
the
authors
of
all
the
mutiny
in
the
*NL*
ship
,
and
if
they
escaped
,
we
should
be
undone
still
,
for
they
would
go
*NL*
on
board
and
bring
the
whole
ship
's
company
,
and
destroy
us
all
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
then
,
''
says
I
,
``
necessity
legitimates
my
advice
,
for
it
is
the
only
way
*NL*
to
save
our
lives
.
''
However
,
seeing
him
still
cautious
of
shedding
*NL*
blood
,
I
told
him
they
should
go
themselves
,
and
manage
as
they
found
*NL*
convenient
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
this
discourse
we
heard
some
of
them
awake
,
and
soon
*NL*
after
we
saw
two
of
them
on
their
feet
.
I
asked
him
if
either
of
them
*NL*
were
the
heads
of
the
mutiny
?
He
said
,
``
No
.
''
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
*NL*
may
let
them
escape
;
and
Providence
seems
to
have
awakened
them
on
*NL*
purpose
to
save
themselves
.
Now
,
''
says
I
,
``
if
the
rest
escape
you
,
it
is
*NL*
your
fault
.
''
Animated
with
this
,
he
took
the
musket
I
had
given
him
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
a
pistol
in
his
belt
,
and
his
two
comrades
with
him
,
with
*NL*
each
a
piece
in
his
hand
;
the
two
men
who
were
with
him
going
first
made
*NL*
some
noise
,
at
which
one
of
the
seamen
who
was
awake
turned
about
,
and
*NL*
seeing
them
coming
,
cried
out
to
the
rest
;
but
was
too
late
then
,
for
the
*NL*
moment
he
cried
out
they
fired
--
I
mean
the
two
men
,
the
captain
wisely
*NL*
reserving
his
own
piece
.
They
had
so
well
aimed
their
shot
at
the
men
*NL*
they
knew
,
that
one
of
them
was
killed
on
the
spot
,
and
the
other
very
*NL*
much
wounded
;
but
not
being
dead
,
he
started
up
on
his
feet
,
and
called
*NL*
eagerly
for
help
to
the
other
;
but
the
captain
stepping
to
him
,
told
him
*NL*
it
was
too
late
to
cry
for
help
,
he
should
call
upon
God
to
forgive
his
*NL*
villainy
,
and
with
that
word
knocked
him
down
with
the
stock
of
his
*NL*
musket
,
so
that
he
never
spoke
more
;
there
were
three
more
in
the
*NL*
company
,
and
one
of
them
was
slightly
wounded
.
By
this
time
I
was
come
;
*NL*
and
when
they
saw
their
danger
,
and
that
it
was
in
vain
to
resist
,
they
*NL*
begged
for
mercy
.
The
captain
told
them
he
would
spare
their
lives
if
*NL*
they
would
give
him
an
assurance
of
their
abhorrence
of
the
treachery
*NL*
they
had
been
guilty
of
,
and
would
swear
to
be
faithful
to
him
in
*NL*
recovering
the
ship
,
and
afterwards
in
carrying
her
back
to
Jamaica
,
from
*NL*
whence
they
came
.
They
gave
him
all
the
protestations
of
their
sincerity
*NL*
that
could
be
desired
;
and
he
was
willing
to
believe
them
,
and
spare
*NL*
their
lives
,
which
I
was
not
against
,
only
that
I
obliged
him
to
keep
*NL*
them
bound
hand
and
foot
while
they
were
on
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
doing
,
I
sent
Friday
with
the
captain
's
mate
to
the
boat
*NL*
with
orders
to
secure
her
,
and
bring
away
the
oars
and
sails
,
which
they
*NL*
did
;
and
by-and-by
three
straggling
men
,
that
were
-LRB-
happily
for
them
-RRB-
*NL*
parted
from
the
rest
,
came
back
upon
hearing
the
guns
fired
;
and
seeing
*NL*
the
captain
,
who
was
before
their
prisoner
,
now
their
conqueror
,
they
*NL*
submitted
to
be
bound
also
;
and
so
our
victory
was
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
now
remained
that
the
captain
and
I
should
inquire
into
one
another
's
*NL*
circumstances
.
I
began
first
,
and
told
him
my
whole
history
,
which
he
*NL*
heard
with
an
attention
even
to
amazement
--
and
particularly
at
the
*NL*
wonderful
manner
of
my
being
furnished
with
provisions
and
ammunition
;
*NL*
and
,
indeed
,
as
my
story
is
a
whole
collection
of
wonders
,
it
affected
*NL*
him
deeply
.
But
when
he
reflected
from
thence
upon
himself
,
and
how
I
*NL*
seemed
to
have
been
preserved
there
on
purpose
to
save
his
life
,
the
*NL*
tears
ran
down
his
face
,
and
he
could
not
speak
a
word
more
.
After
this
*NL*
communication
was
at
an
end
,
I
carried
him
and
his
two
men
into
my
*NL*
apartment
,
leading
them
in
just
where
I
came
out
,
viz
.
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
house
,
where
I
refreshed
them
with
such
provisions
as
I
had
,
and
showed
*NL*
them
all
the
contrivances
I
had
made
during
my
long
,
long
inhabiting
that
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
I
showed
them
,
all
I
said
to
them
,
was
perfectly
amazing
;
but
above
*NL*
all
,
the
captain
admired
my
fortification
,
and
how
perfectly
I
had
*NL*
concealed
my
retreat
with
a
grove
of
trees
,
which
having
been
now
planted
*NL*
nearly
twenty
years
,
and
the
trees
growing
much
faster
than
in
England
,
*NL*
was
become
a
little
wood
,
so
thick
that
it
was
impassable
in
any
part
of
*NL*
it
but
at
that
one
side
where
I
had
reserved
my
little
winding
passage
*NL*
into
it
.
I
told
him
this
was
my
castle
and
my
residence
,
but
that
I
had
*NL*
a
seat
in
the
country
,
as
most
princes
have
,
whither
I
could
retreat
upon
*NL*
occasion
,
and
I
would
show
him
that
too
another
time
;
but
at
present
our
*NL*
business
was
to
consider
how
to
recover
the
ship
.
He
agreed
with
me
as
*NL*
to
that
,
but
told
me
he
was
perfectly
at
a
loss
what
measures
to
take
,
*NL*
for
that
there
were
still
six-and-twenty
hands
on
board
,
who
,
having
*NL*
entered
into
a
cursed
conspiracy
,
by
which
they
had
all
forfeited
their
*NL*
lives
to
the
law
,
would
be
hardened
in
it
now
by
desperation
,
and
would
*NL*
carry
it
on
,
knowing
that
if
they
were
subdued
they
would
be
brought
to
*NL*
the
gallows
as
soon
as
they
came
to
England
,
or
to
any
of
the
English
*NL*
colonies
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
there
would
be
no
attacking
them
with
so
*NL*
small
a
number
as
we
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mused
for
some
time
on
what
he
had
said
,
and
found
it
was
a
very
*NL*
rational
conclusion
,
and
that
therefore
something
was
to
be
resolved
on
*NL*
speedily
,
as
well
to
draw
the
men
on
board
into
some
snare
for
their
*NL*
surprise
as
to
prevent
their
landing
upon
us
,
and
destroying
us
.
Upon
*NL*
this
,
it
presently
occurred
to
me
that
in
a
little
while
the
ship
's
crew
,
*NL*
wondering
what
was
become
of
their
comrades
and
of
the
boat
,
would
*NL*
certainly
come
on
shore
in
their
other
boat
to
look
for
them
,
and
that
*NL*
then
,
perhaps
,
they
might
come
armed
,
and
be
too
strong
for
us
:
this
he
*NL*
allowed
to
be
rational
.
Upon
this
,
I
told
him
the
first
thing
we
had
to
*NL*
do
was
to
stave
the
boat
which
lay
upon
the
beach
,
so
that
they
might
not
*NL*
carry
her
of
,
and
taking
everything
out
of
her
,
leave
her
so
far
useless
*NL*
as
not
to
be
fit
to
swim
.
Accordingly
,
we
went
on
board
,
took
the
arms
*NL*
which
were
left
on
board
out
of
her
,
and
whatever
else
we
found
*NL*
there
--
which
was
a
bottle
of
brandy
,
and
another
of
rum
,
a
few
*NL*
biscuit-cakes
,
a
horn
of
powder
,
and
a
great
lump
of
sugar
in
a
piece
of
*NL*
canvas
-LRB-
the
sugar
was
five
or
six
pounds
-RRB-
:
all
which
was
very
welcome
to
*NL*
me
,
especially
the
brandy
and
sugar
,
of
which
I
had
had
none
left
for
*NL*
many
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
carried
all
these
things
on
shore
-LRB-
the
oars
,
mast
,
sail
,
and
*NL*
rudder
of
the
boat
were
carried
away
before
-RRB-
,
we
knocked
a
great
hole
in
*NL*
her
bottom
,
that
if
they
had
come
strong
enough
to
master
us
,
yet
they
*NL*
could
not
carry
off
the
boat
.
Indeed
,
it
was
not
much
in
my
thoughts
*NL*
that
we
could
be
able
to
recover
the
ship
;
but
my
view
was
,
that
if
they
*NL*
went
away
without
the
boat
,
I
did
not
much
question
to
make
her
again
fit
*NL*
to
carry
as
to
the
Leeward
Islands
,
and
call
upon
our
friends
the
*NL*
Spaniards
in
my
way
,
for
I
had
them
still
in
my
thoughts
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
--
THE
SHIP
RECOVERED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
thus
preparing
our
designs
,
and
had
first
,
by
main
*NL*
strength
,
heaved
the
boat
upon
the
beach
,
so
high
that
the
tide
would
not
*NL*
float
her
off
at
high-water
mark
,
and
besides
,
had
broke
a
hole
in
her
*NL*
bottom
too
big
to
be
quickly
stopped
,
and
were
set
down
musing
what
we
*NL*
should
do
,
we
heard
the
ship
fire
a
gun
,
and
make
a
waft
with
her
ensign
*NL*
as
a
signal
for
the
boat
to
come
on
board
--
but
no
boat
stirred
;
and
they
*NL*
fired
several
times
,
making
other
signals
for
the
boat
.
At
last
,
when
*NL*
all
their
signals
and
firing
proved
fruitless
,
and
they
found
the
boat
*NL*
did
not
stir
,
we
saw
them
,
by
the
help
of
my
glasses
,
hoist
another
boat
*NL*
out
and
row
towards
the
shore
;
and
we
found
,
as
they
approached
,
that
*NL*
there
were
no
less
than
ten
men
in
her
,
and
that
they
had
firearms
with
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
ship
lay
almost
two
leagues
from
the
shore
,
we
had
a
full
view
of
*NL*
them
as
they
came
,
and
a
plain
sight
even
of
their
faces
;
because
the
*NL*
tide
having
set
them
a
little
to
the
east
of
the
other
boat
,
they
rowed
*NL*
up
under
shore
,
to
come
to
the
same
place
where
the
other
had
landed
,
and
*NL*
where
the
boat
lay
;
by
this
means
,
I
say
,
we
had
a
full
view
of
them
,
and
*NL*
the
captain
knew
the
persons
and
characters
of
all
the
men
in
the
boat
,
*NL*
of
whom
,
he
said
,
there
were
three
very
honest
fellows
,
who
,
he
was
sure
,
*NL*
were
led
into
this
conspiracy
by
the
rest
,
being
over-powered
and
*NL*
frightened
;
but
that
as
for
the
boatswain
,
who
it
seems
was
the
chief
*NL*
officer
among
them
,
and
all
the
rest
,
they
were
as
outrageous
as
any
of
*NL*
the
ship
's
crew
,
and
were
no
doubt
made
desperate
in
their
new
*NL*
enterprise
;
and
terribly
apprehensive
he
was
that
they
would
be
too
*NL*
powerful
for
us
.
I
smiled
at
him
,
and
told
him
that
men
in
our
*NL*
circumstances
were
past
the
operation
of
fear
;
that
seeing
almost
every
*NL*
condition
that
could
be
was
better
than
that
which
we
were
supposed
to
be
*NL*
in
,
we
ought
to
expect
that
the
consequence
,
whether
death
or
life
,
would
*NL*
be
sure
to
be
a
deliverance
.
I
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
*NL*
circumstances
of
my
life
,
and
whether
a
deliverance
were
not
worth
*NL*
venturing
for
?
``
And
where
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
is
your
belief
of
my
being
*NL*
preserved
here
on
purpose
to
save
your
life
,
which
elevated
you
a
little
*NL*
while
ago
?
For
my
part
,
''
said
I
,
``
there
seems
to
be
but
one
thing
amiss
*NL*
in
all
the
prospect
of
it
.
''
``
What
is
that
?
''
say
he
.
``
Why
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
*NL*
is
,
that
as
you
say
there
are
three
or
four
honest
fellows
among
them
*NL*
which
should
be
spared
,
had
they
been
all
of
the
wicked
part
of
the
crew
*NL*
I
should
have
thought
God
's
providence
had
singled
them
out
to
deliver
*NL*
them
into
your
hands
;
for
depend
upon
it
,
every
man
that
comes
ashore
is
*NL*
our
own
,
and
shall
die
or
live
as
they
behave
to
us
.
''
As
I
spoke
this
*NL*
with
a
raised
voice
and
cheerful
countenance
,
I
found
it
greatly
*NL*
encouraged
him
;
so
we
set
vigorously
to
our
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
,
upon
the
first
appearance
of
the
boat
's
coming
from
the
ship
,
*NL*
considered
of
separating
our
prisoners
;
and
we
had
,
indeed
,
secured
them
*NL*
effectually
.
Two
of
them
,
of
whom
the
captain
was
less
assured
than
*NL*
ordinary
,
I
sent
with
Friday
,
and
one
of
the
three
delivered
men
,
to
my
*NL*
cave
,
where
they
were
remote
enough
,
and
out
of
danger
of
being
heard
or
*NL*
discovered
,
or
of
finding
their
way
out
of
the
woods
if
they
could
have
*NL*
delivered
themselves
.
Here
they
left
them
bound
,
but
gave
them
*NL*
provisions
;
and
promised
them
,
if
they
continued
there
quietly
,
to
give
*NL*
them
their
liberty
in
a
day
or
two
;
but
that
if
they
attempted
their
*NL*
escape
they
should
be
put
to
death
without
mercy
.
They
promised
*NL*
faithfully
to
bear
their
confinement
with
patience
,
and
were
very
*NL*
thankful
that
they
had
such
good
usage
as
to
have
provisions
and
light
*NL*
left
them
;
for
Friday
gave
them
candles
-LRB-
such
as
we
made
ourselves
-RRB-
for
*NL*
their
comfort
;
and
they
did
not
know
but
that
he
stood
sentinel
over
them
*NL*
at
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
prisoners
had
better
usage
;
two
of
them
were
kept
pinioned
,
*NL*
indeed
,
because
the
captain
was
not
able
to
trust
them
;
but
the
other
two
*NL*
were
taken
into
my
service
,
upon
the
captain
's
recommendation
,
and
upon
*NL*
their
solemnly
engaging
to
live
and
die
with
us
;
so
with
them
and
the
*NL*
three
honest
men
we
were
seven
men
,
well
armed
;
and
I
made
no
doubt
we
*NL*
should
be
able
to
deal
well
enough
with
the
ten
that
were
coming
,
*NL*
considering
that
the
captain
had
said
there
were
three
or
four
honest
men
*NL*
among
them
also
.
As
soon
as
they
got
to
the
place
where
their
other
boat
*NL*
lay
,
they
ran
their
boat
into
the
beach
and
came
all
on
shore
,
hauling
*NL*
the
boat
up
after
them
,
which
I
was
glad
to
see
,
for
I
was
afraid
they
*NL*
would
rather
have
left
the
boat
at
an
anchor
some
distance
from
the
*NL*
shore
,
with
some
hands
in
her
to
guard
her
,
and
so
we
should
not
be
able
*NL*
to
seize
the
boat
.
Being
on
shore
,
the
first
thing
they
did
,
they
ran
*NL*
all
to
their
other
boat
;
and
it
was
easy
to
see
they
were
under
a
great
*NL*
surprise
to
find
her
stripped
,
as
above
,
of
all
that
was
in
her
,
and
a
*NL*
great
hole
in
her
bottom
.
After
they
had
mused
a
while
upon
this
,
they
*NL*
set
up
two
or
three
great
shouts
,
hallooing
with
all
their
might
,
to
try
*NL*
if
they
could
make
their
companions
hear
;
but
all
was
to
no
purpose
.
*NL*
Then
they
came
all
close
in
a
ring
,
and
fired
a
volley
of
their
small
*NL*
arms
,
which
indeed
we
heard
,
and
the
echoes
made
the
woods
ring
.
But
it
*NL*
was
all
one
;
those
in
the
cave
,
we
were
sure
,
could
not
hear
;
and
those
*NL*
in
our
keeping
,
though
they
heard
it
well
enough
,
yet
durst
give
no
*NL*
answer
to
them
.
They
were
so
astonished
at
the
surprise
of
this
,
that
,
*NL*
as
they
told
us
afterwards
,
they
resolved
to
go
all
on
board
again
to
*NL*
their
ship
,
and
let
them
know
that
the
men
were
all
murdered
,
and
the
*NL*
long-boat
staved
;
accordingly
,
they
immediately
launched
their
boat
*NL*
again
,
and
got
all
of
them
on
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
terribly
amazed
,
and
even
confounded
,
at
this
,
believing
*NL*
they
would
go
on
board
the
ship
again
and
set
sail
,
giving
their
comrades
*NL*
over
for
lost
,
and
so
he
should
still
lose
the
ship
,
which
he
was
in
*NL*
hopes
we
should
have
recovered
;
but
he
was
quickly
as
much
frightened
the
*NL*
other
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
been
long
put
off
with
the
boat
,
when
we
perceived
them
all
*NL*
coming
on
shore
again
;
but
with
this
new
measure
in
their
conduct
,
which
*NL*
it
seems
they
consulted
together
upon
,
viz
.
to
leave
three
men
in
the
*NL*
boat
,
and
the
rest
to
go
on
shore
,
and
go
up
into
the
country
to
look
for
*NL*
their
fellows
.
This
was
a
great
disappointment
to
us
,
for
now
we
were
at
*NL*
a
loss
what
to
do
,
as
our
seizing
those
seven
men
on
shore
would
be
no
*NL*
advantage
to
us
if
we
let
the
boat
escape
;
because
they
would
row
away
to
*NL*
the
ship
,
and
then
the
rest
of
them
would
be
sure
to
weigh
and
set
sail
,
*NL*
and
so
our
recovering
the
ship
would
be
lost
.
However
we
had
no
remedy
*NL*
but
to
wait
and
see
what
the
issue
of
things
might
present
.
The
seven
*NL*
men
came
on
shore
,
and
the
three
who
remained
in
the
boat
put
her
off
to
*NL*
a
good
distance
from
the
shore
,
and
came
to
an
anchor
to
wait
for
them
;
*NL*
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
come
at
them
in
the
boat
.
Those
that
*NL*
came
on
shore
kept
close
together
,
marching
towards
the
top
of
the
little
*NL*
hill
under
which
my
habitation
lay
;
and
we
could
see
them
plainly
,
though
*NL*
they
could
not
perceive
us
.
We
should
have
been
very
glad
if
they
would
*NL*
have
come
nearer
us
,
so
that
we
might
have
fired
at
them
,
or
that
they
*NL*
would
have
gone
farther
off
,
that
we
might
come
abroad
.
But
when
they
*NL*
were
come
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
where
they
could
see
a
great
way
into
*NL*
the
valleys
and
woods
,
which
lay
towards
the
north-east
part
,
and
where
*NL*
the
island
lay
lowest
,
they
shouted
and
hallooed
till
they
were
weary
;
*NL*
and
not
caring
,
it
seems
,
to
venture
far
from
the
shore
,
nor
far
from
one
*NL*
another
,
they
sat
down
together
under
a
tree
to
consider
it
.
Had
they
*NL*
thought
fit
to
have
gone
to
sleep
there
,
as
the
other
part
of
them
had
*NL*
done
,
they
had
done
the
job
for
us
;
but
they
were
too
full
of
*NL*
apprehensions
of
danger
to
venture
to
go
to
sleep
,
though
they
could
not
*NL*
tell
what
the
danger
was
they
had
to
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
made
a
very
just
proposal
to
me
upon
this
consultation
of
*NL*
theirs
,
viz
.
that
perhaps
they
would
all
fire
a
volley
again
,
to
*NL*
endeavour
to
make
their
fellows
hear
,
and
that
we
should
all
sally
upon
*NL*
them
just
at
the
juncture
when
their
pieces
were
all
discharged
,
and
they
*NL*
would
certainly
yield
,
and
we
should
have
them
without
bloodshed
.
I
*NL*
liked
this
proposal
,
provided
it
was
done
while
we
were
near
enough
to
*NL*
come
up
to
them
before
they
could
load
their
pieces
again
.
But
this
*NL*
event
did
not
happen
;
and
we
lay
still
a
long
time
,
very
irresolute
what
*NL*
course
to
take
.
At
length
I
told
them
there
would
be
nothing
done
,
in
my
*NL*
opinion
,
till
night
;
and
then
,
if
they
did
not
return
to
the
boat
,
*NL*
perhaps
we
might
find
a
way
to
get
between
them
and
the
shore
,
and
so
*NL*
might
use
some
stratagem
with
them
in
the
boat
to
get
them
on
shore
.
We
*NL*
waited
a
great
while
,
though
very
impatient
for
their
removing
;
and
were
*NL*
very
uneasy
when
,
after
long
consultation
,
we
saw
them
all
start
up
and
*NL*
march
down
towards
the
sea
;
it
seems
they
had
such
dreadful
apprehensions
*NL*
of
the
danger
of
the
place
that
they
resolved
to
go
on
board
the
ship
*NL*
again
,
give
their
companions
over
for
lost
,
and
so
go
on
with
their
*NL*
intended
voyage
with
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
perceived
them
go
towards
the
shore
,
I
imagined
it
to
be
as
*NL*
it
really
was
that
they
had
given
over
their
search
,
and
were
going
back
*NL*
again
;
and
the
captain
,
as
soon
as
I
told
him
my
thoughts
,
was
ready
to
*NL*
sink
at
the
apprehensions
of
it
;
but
I
presently
thought
of
a
stratagem
*NL*
to
fetch
them
back
again
,
and
which
answered
my
end
to
a
tittle
.
I
*NL*
ordered
Friday
and
the
captain
's
mate
to
go
over
the
little
creek
*NL*
westward
,
towards
the
place
where
the
savages
came
on
shore
,
when
Friday
*NL*
was
rescued
,
and
so
soon
as
they
came
to
a
little
rising
round
,
at
about
*NL*
half
a
mile
distant
,
I
bid
them
halloo
out
,
as
loud
as
they
could
,
and
*NL*
wait
till
they
found
the
seamen
heard
them
;
that
as
soon
as
ever
they
*NL*
heard
the
seamen
answer
them
,
they
should
return
it
again
;
and
then
,
*NL*
keeping
out
of
sight
,
take
a
round
,
always
answering
when
the
others
*NL*
hallooed
,
to
draw
them
as
far
into
the
island
and
among
the
woods
as
*NL*
possible
,
and
then
wheel
about
again
to
me
by
such
ways
as
I
directed
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
just
going
into
the
boat
when
Friday
and
the
mate
hallooed
;
and
*NL*
they
presently
heard
them
,
and
answering
,
ran
along
the
shore
westward
,
*NL*
towards
the
voice
they
heard
,
when
they
were
stopped
by
the
creek
,
where
*NL*
the
water
being
up
,
they
could
not
get
over
,
and
called
for
the
boat
to
*NL*
come
up
and
set
them
over
;
as
,
indeed
,
I
expected
.
When
they
had
set
*NL*
themselves
over
,
I
observed
that
the
boat
being
gone
a
good
way
into
the
*NL*
creek
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
harbour
within
the
land
,
they
took
one
of
*NL*
the
three
men
out
of
her
,
to
go
along
with
them
,
and
left
only
two
in
the
*NL*
boat
,
having
fastened
her
to
the
stump
of
a
little
tree
on
the
shore
.
*NL*
This
was
what
I
wished
for
;
and
immediately
leaving
Friday
and
the
*NL*
captain
's
mate
to
their
business
,
I
took
the
rest
with
me
;
and
,
crossing
*NL*
the
creek
out
of
their
sight
,
we
surprised
the
two
men
before
they
were
*NL*
aware
--
one
of
them
lying
on
the
shore
,
and
the
other
being
in
the
boat
.
*NL*
The
fellow
on
shore
was
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
and
going
to
start
*NL*
up
;
the
captain
,
who
was
foremost
,
ran
in
upon
him
,
and
knocked
him
down
;
*NL*
and
then
called
out
to
him
in
the
boat
to
yield
,
or
he
was
a
dead
man
.
*NL*
They
needed
very
few
arguments
to
persuade
a
single
man
to
yield
,
when
he
*NL*
saw
five
men
upon
him
and
his
comrade
knocked
down
:
besides
,
this
was
,
it
*NL*
seems
,
one
of
the
three
who
were
not
so
hearty
in
the
mutiny
as
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
crew
,
and
therefore
was
easily
persuaded
not
only
to
yield
,
but
*NL*
afterwards
to
join
very
sincerely
with
us
.
In
the
meantime
,
Friday
and
*NL*
the
captain
's
mate
so
well
managed
their
business
with
the
rest
that
they
*NL*
drew
them
,
by
hallooing
and
answering
,
from
one
hill
to
another
,
and
from
*NL*
one
wood
to
another
,
till
they
not
only
heartily
tired
them
,
but
left
*NL*
them
where
they
were
,
very
sure
they
could
not
reach
back
to
the
boat
*NL*
before
it
was
dark
;
and
,
indeed
,
they
were
heartily
tired
themselves
*NL*
also
,
by
the
time
they
came
back
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
nothing
now
to
do
but
to
watch
for
them
in
the
dark
,
and
to
fall
*NL*
upon
them
,
so
as
to
make
sure
work
with
them
.
It
was
several
hours
after
*NL*
Friday
came
back
to
me
before
they
came
back
to
their
boat
;
and
we
could
*NL*
hear
the
foremost
of
them
,
long
before
they
came
quite
up
,
calling
to
*NL*
those
behind
to
come
along
;
and
could
also
hear
them
answer
,
and
complain
*NL*
how
lame
and
tired
they
were
,
and
not
able
to
come
any
faster
:
which
was
*NL*
very
welcome
news
to
us
.
At
length
they
came
up
to
the
boat
:
but
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
express
their
confusion
when
they
found
the
boat
fast
*NL*
aground
in
the
creek
,
the
tide
ebbed
out
,
and
their
two
men
gone
.
We
*NL*
could
hear
them
call
one
to
another
in
a
most
lamentable
manner
,
telling
*NL*
one
another
they
were
got
into
an
enchanted
island
;
that
either
there
*NL*
were
inhabitants
in
it
,
and
they
should
all
be
murdered
,
or
else
there
*NL*
were
devils
and
spirits
in
it
,
and
they
should
be
all
carried
away
and
*NL*
devoured
.
They
hallooed
again
,
and
called
their
two
comrades
by
their
*NL*
names
a
great
many
times
;
but
no
answer
.
After
some
time
we
could
see
*NL*
them
,
by
the
little
light
there
was
,
run
about
,
wringing
their
hands
like
*NL*
men
in
despair
,
and
sometimes
they
would
go
and
sit
down
in
the
boat
to
*NL*
rest
themselves
:
then
come
ashore
again
,
and
walk
about
again
,
and
so
the
*NL*
same
thing
over
again
.
My
men
would
fain
have
had
me
give
them
leave
to
*NL*
fall
upon
them
at
once
in
the
dark
;
but
I
was
willing
to
take
them
at
*NL*
some
advantage
,
so
as
to
spare
them
,
and
kill
as
few
of
them
as
I
could
;
*NL*
and
especially
I
was
unwilling
to
hazard
the
killing
of
any
of
our
men
,
*NL*
knowing
the
others
were
very
well
armed
.
I
resolved
to
wait
,
to
see
if
*NL*
they
did
not
separate
;
and
therefore
,
to
make
sure
of
them
,
I
drew
my
*NL*
ambuscade
nearer
,
and
ordered
Friday
and
the
captain
to
creep
upon
their
*NL*
hands
and
feet
,
as
close
to
the
ground
as
they
could
,
that
they
might
not
*NL*
be
discovered
,
and
get
as
near
them
as
they
could
possibly
before
they
*NL*
offered
to
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
been
long
in
that
posture
when
the
boatswain
,
who
was
the
*NL*
principal
ringleader
of
the
mutiny
,
and
had
now
shown
himself
the
most
*NL*
dejected
and
dispirited
of
all
the
rest
,
came
walking
towards
them
,
with
*NL*
two
more
of
the
crew
;
the
captain
was
so
eager
at
having
this
principal
*NL*
rogue
so
much
in
his
power
,
that
he
could
hardly
have
patience
to
let
him
*NL*
come
so
near
as
to
be
sure
of
him
,
for
they
only
heard
his
tongue
before
:
*NL*
but
when
they
came
nearer
,
the
captain
and
Friday
,
starting
up
on
their
*NL*
feet
,
let
fly
at
them
.
The
boatswain
was
killed
upon
the
spot
:
the
next
*NL*
man
was
shot
in
the
body
,
and
fell
just
by
him
,
though
he
did
not
die
*NL*
till
an
hour
or
two
after
;
and
the
third
ran
for
it
.
At
the
noise
of
the
*NL*
fire
I
immediately
advanced
with
my
whole
army
,
which
was
now
eight
men
,
*NL*
viz
.
myself
,
generalissimo
;
Friday
,
my
lieutenant-general
;
the
captain
*NL*
and
his
two
men
,
and
the
three
prisoners
of
war
whom
we
had
trusted
with
*NL*
arms
.
We
came
upon
them
,
indeed
,
in
the
dark
,
so
that
they
could
not
see
*NL*
our
number
;
and
I
made
the
man
they
had
left
in
the
boat
,
who
was
now
one
*NL*
of
us
,
to
call
them
by
name
,
to
try
if
I
could
bring
them
to
a
parley
,
*NL*
and
so
perhaps
might
reduce
them
to
terms
;
which
fell
out
just
as
we
*NL*
desired
:
for
indeed
it
was
easy
to
think
,
as
their
condition
then
was
,
*NL*
they
would
be
very
willing
to
capitulate
.
So
he
calls
out
as
loud
as
he
*NL*
could
to
one
of
them
,
``
Tom
Smith
!
Tom
Smith
!
''
Tom
Smith
answered
*NL*
immediately
,
``
Is
that
Robinson
?
''
for
it
seems
he
knew
the
voice
.
The
*NL*
other
answered
,
``
Ay
,
ay
;
for
God
's
sake
,
Tom
Smith
,
throw
down
your
arms
*NL*
and
yield
,
or
you
are
all
dead
men
this
moment
.
''
``
Who
must
we
yield
to
?
*NL*
Where
are
they
?
''
says
Smith
again
.
``
Here
they
are
,
''
says
he
;
``
here
's
our
*NL*
captain
and
fifty
men
with
him
,
have
been
hunting
you
these
two
hours
;
*NL*
the
boatswain
is
killed
;
Will
Fry
is
wounded
,
and
I
am
a
prisoner
;
and
if
*NL*
you
do
not
yield
you
are
all
lost
.
''
``
Will
they
give
us
quarter
,
then
?
''
*NL*
says
Tom
Smith
,
``
and
we
will
yield
.
''
``
I
'll
go
and
ask
,
if
you
promise
to
*NL*
yield
,
''
said
Robinson
:
so
he
asked
the
captain
,
and
the
captain
himself
*NL*
then
calls
out
,
``
You
,
Smith
,
you
know
my
voice
;
if
you
lay
down
your
arms
*NL*
immediately
and
submit
,
you
shall
have
your
lives
,
all
but
Will
Atkins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
Will
Atkins
cried
out
,
``
For
God
's
sake
,
captain
,
give
me
*NL*
quarter
;
what
have
I
done
?
They
have
all
been
as
bad
as
I
:
''
which
,
by
*NL*
the
way
,
was
not
true
;
for
it
seems
this
Will
Atkins
was
the
first
man
*NL*
that
laid
hold
of
the
captain
when
they
first
mutinied
,
and
used
him
*NL*
barbarously
in
tying
his
hands
and
giving
him
injurious
language
.
*NL*
However
,
the
captain
told
him
he
must
lay
down
his
arms
at
discretion
,
*NL*
and
trust
to
the
governor
's
mercy
:
by
which
he
meant
me
,
for
they
all
*NL*
called
me
governor
.
In
a
word
,
they
all
laid
down
their
arms
and
begged
*NL*
their
lives
;
and
I
sent
the
man
that
had
parleyed
with
them
,
and
two
*NL*
more
,
who
bound
them
all
;
and
then
my
great
army
of
fifty
men
,
which
,
*NL*
with
those
three
,
were
in
all
but
eight
,
came
up
and
seized
upon
them
,
*NL*
and
upon
their
boat
;
only
that
I
kept
myself
and
one
more
out
of
sight
*NL*
for
reasons
of
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
next
work
was
to
repair
the
boat
,
and
think
of
seizing
the
ship
:
and
*NL*
as
for
the
captain
,
now
he
had
leisure
to
parley
with
them
,
he
*NL*
expostulated
with
them
upon
the
villainy
of
their
practices
with
him
,
and
*NL*
upon
the
further
wickedness
of
their
design
,
and
how
certainly
it
must
*NL*
bring
them
to
misery
and
distress
in
the
end
,
and
perhaps
to
the
gallows
.
*NL*
They
all
appeared
very
penitent
,
and
begged
hard
for
their
lives
.
As
for
*NL*
that
,
he
told
them
they
were
not
his
prisoners
,
but
the
commander
's
of
*NL*
the
island
;
that
they
thought
they
had
set
him
on
shore
in
a
barren
,
*NL*
uninhabited
island
;
but
it
had
pleased
God
so
to
direct
them
that
it
was
*NL*
inhabited
,
and
that
the
governor
was
an
Englishman
;
that
he
might
hang
*NL*
them
all
there
,
if
he
pleased
;
but
as
he
had
given
them
all
quarter
,
he
*NL*
supposed
he
would
send
them
to
England
,
to
be
dealt
with
there
as
justice
*NL*
required
,
except
Atkins
,
whom
he
was
commanded
by
the
governor
to
advise
*NL*
to
prepare
for
death
,
for
that
he
would
be
hanged
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
this
was
all
but
a
fiction
of
his
own
,
yet
it
had
its
desired
*NL*
effect
;
Atkins
fell
upon
his
knees
to
beg
the
captain
to
intercede
with
*NL*
the
governor
for
his
life
;
and
all
the
rest
begged
of
him
,
for
God
's
*NL*
sake
,
that
they
might
not
be
sent
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
now
occurred
to
me
that
the
time
of
our
deliverance
was
come
,
and
that
*NL*
it
would
be
a
most
easy
thing
to
bring
these
fellows
in
to
be
hearty
in
*NL*
getting
possession
of
the
ship
;
so
I
retired
in
the
dark
from
them
,
that
*NL*
they
might
not
see
what
kind
of
a
governor
they
had
,
and
called
the
*NL*
captain
to
me
;
when
I
called
,
at
a
good
distance
,
one
of
the
men
was
*NL*
ordered
to
speak
again
,
and
say
to
the
captain
,
``
Captain
,
the
commander
*NL*
calls
for
you
;
''
and
presently
the
captain
replied
,
``
Tell
his
excellency
I
*NL*
am
just
coming
.
''
This
more
perfectly
amazed
them
,
and
they
all
believed
*NL*
that
the
commander
was
just
by
,
with
his
fifty
men
.
Upon
the
captain
*NL*
coming
to
me
,
I
told
him
my
project
for
seizing
the
ship
,
which
he
liked
*NL*
wonderfully
well
,
and
resolved
to
put
it
in
execution
the
next
morning
.
*NL*
But
,
in
order
to
execute
it
with
more
art
,
and
to
be
secure
of
success
,
I
*NL*
told
him
we
must
divide
the
prisoners
,
and
that
he
should
go
and
take
*NL*
Atkins
,
and
two
more
of
the
worst
of
them
,
and
send
them
pinioned
to
the
*NL*
cave
where
the
others
lay
.
This
was
committed
to
Friday
and
the
two
men
*NL*
who
came
on
shore
with
the
captain
.
They
conveyed
them
to
the
cave
as
to
*NL*
a
prison
:
and
it
was
,
indeed
,
a
dismal
place
,
especially
to
men
in
their
*NL*
condition
.
The
others
I
ordered
to
my
bower
,
as
I
called
it
,
of
which
I
*NL*
have
given
a
full
description
:
and
as
it
was
fenced
in
,
and
they
*NL*
pinioned
,
the
place
was
secure
enough
,
considering
they
were
upon
their
*NL*
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
these
in
the
morning
I
sent
the
captain
,
who
was
to
enter
into
a
*NL*
parley
with
them
;
in
a
word
,
to
try
them
,
and
tell
me
whether
he
thought
*NL*
they
might
be
trusted
or
not
to
go
on
board
and
surprise
the
ship
.
He
*NL*
talked
to
them
of
the
injury
done
him
,
of
the
condition
they
were
brought
*NL*
to
,
and
that
though
the
governor
had
given
them
quarter
for
their
lives
*NL*
as
to
the
present
action
,
yet
that
if
they
were
sent
to
England
they
*NL*
would
all
be
hanged
in
chains
;
but
that
if
they
would
join
in
so
just
an
*NL*
attempt
as
to
recover
the
ship
,
he
would
have
the
governor
's
engagement
*NL*
for
their
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
may
guess
how
readily
such
a
proposal
would
be
accepted
by
men
in
*NL*
their
condition
;
they
fell
down
on
their
knees
to
the
captain
,
and
*NL*
promised
,
with
the
deepest
imprecations
,
that
they
would
be
faithful
to
*NL*
him
to
the
last
drop
,
and
that
they
should
owe
their
lives
to
him
,
and
*NL*
would
go
with
him
all
over
the
world
;
that
they
would
own
him
as
a
father
*NL*
to
them
as
long
as
they
lived
.
``
Well
,
''
says
the
captain
,
``
I
must
go
and
*NL*
tell
the
governor
what
you
say
,
and
see
what
I
can
do
to
bring
him
to
*NL*
consent
to
it
.
''
So
he
brought
me
an
account
of
the
temper
he
found
them
*NL*
in
,
and
that
he
verily
believed
they
would
be
faithful
.
However
,
that
we
*NL*
might
be
very
secure
,
I
told
him
he
should
go
back
again
and
choose
out
*NL*
those
five
,
and
tell
them
,
that
they
might
see
he
did
not
want
men
,
that
*NL*
he
would
take
out
those
five
to
be
his
assistants
,
and
that
the
governor
*NL*
would
keep
the
other
two
,
and
the
three
that
were
sent
prisoners
to
the
*NL*
castle
-LRB-
my
cave
-RRB-
,
as
hostages
for
the
fidelity
of
those
five
;
and
that
if
*NL*
they
proved
unfaithful
in
the
execution
,
the
five
hostages
should
be
*NL*
hanged
in
chains
alive
on
the
shore
.
This
looked
severe
,
and
convinced
*NL*
them
that
the
governor
was
in
earnest
;
however
,
they
had
no
way
left
them
*NL*
but
to
accept
it
;
and
it
was
now
the
business
of
the
prisoners
,
as
much
*NL*
as
of
the
captain
,
to
persuade
the
other
five
to
do
their
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
strength
was
now
thus
ordered
for
the
expedition
:
first
,
the
captain
,
*NL*
his
mate
,
and
passenger
;
second
,
the
two
prisoners
of
the
first
gang
,
to
*NL*
whom
,
having
their
character
from
the
captain
,
I
had
given
their
liberty
,
*NL*
and
trusted
them
with
arms
;
third
,
the
other
two
that
I
had
kept
till
now
*NL*
in
my
bower
,
pinioned
,
but
on
the
captain
's
motion
had
now
released
;
*NL*
fourth
,
these
five
released
at
last
;
so
that
there
were
twelve
in
all
,
*NL*
besides
five
we
kept
prisoners
in
the
cave
for
hostages
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
the
captain
if
he
was
willing
to
venture
with
these
hands
on
*NL*
board
the
ship
;
but
as
for
me
and
my
man
Friday
,
I
did
not
think
it
was
*NL*
proper
for
us
to
stir
,
having
seven
men
left
behind
;
and
it
was
*NL*
employment
enough
for
us
to
keep
them
asunder
,
and
supply
them
with
*NL*
victuals
.
As
to
the
five
in
the
cave
,
I
resolved
to
keep
them
fast
,
but
*NL*
Friday
went
in
twice
a
day
to
them
,
to
supply
them
with
necessaries
;
and
*NL*
I
made
the
other
two
carry
provisions
to
a
certain
distance
,
where
Friday
*NL*
was
to
take
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
showed
myself
to
the
two
hostages
,
it
was
with
the
captain
,
who
*NL*
told
them
I
was
the
person
the
governor
had
ordered
to
look
after
them
;
*NL*
and
that
it
was
the
governor
's
pleasure
they
should
not
stir
anywhere
but
*NL*
by
my
direction
;
that
if
they
did
,
they
would
be
fetched
into
the
castle
,
*NL*
and
be
laid
in
irons
:
so
that
as
we
never
suffered
them
to
see
me
as
*NL*
governor
,
I
now
appeared
as
another
person
,
and
spoke
of
the
governor
,
*NL*
the
garrison
,
the
castle
,
and
the
like
,
upon
all
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
now
had
no
difficulty
before
him
,
but
to
furnish
his
two
*NL*
boats
,
stop
the
breach
of
one
,
and
man
them
.
He
made
his
passenger
*NL*
captain
of
one
,
with
four
of
the
men
;
and
himself
,
his
mate
,
and
five
*NL*
more
,
went
in
the
other
;
and
they
contrived
their
business
very
well
,
for
*NL*
they
came
up
to
the
ship
about
midnight
.
As
soon
as
they
came
within
*NL*
call
of
the
ship
,
he
made
Robinson
hail
them
,
and
tell
them
they
had
*NL*
brought
off
the
men
and
the
boat
,
but
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
*NL*
had
found
them
,
and
the
like
,
holding
them
in
a
chat
till
they
came
to
*NL*
the
ship
's
side
;
when
the
captain
and
the
mate
entering
first
with
their
*NL*
arms
,
immediately
knocked
down
the
second
mate
and
carpenter
with
the
*NL*
butt-end
of
their
muskets
,
being
very
faithfully
seconded
by
their
men
;
*NL*
they
secured
all
the
rest
that
were
upon
the
main
and
quarter
decks
,
and
*NL*
began
to
fasten
the
hatches
,
to
keep
them
down
that
were
below
;
when
the
*NL*
other
boat
and
their
men
,
entering
at
the
forechains
,
secured
the
*NL*
forecastle
of
the
ship
,
and
the
scuttle
which
went
down
into
the
*NL*
cook-room
,
making
three
men
they
found
there
prisoners
.
When
this
was
*NL*
done
,
and
all
safe
upon
deck
,
the
captain
ordered
the
mate
,
with
three
*NL*
men
,
to
break
into
the
round-house
,
where
the
new
rebel
captain
lay
,
who
,
*NL*
having
taken
the
alarm
,
had
got
up
,
and
with
two
men
and
a
boy
had
got
*NL*
firearms
in
their
hands
;
and
when
the
mate
,
with
a
crow
,
split
open
the
*NL*
door
,
the
new
captain
and
his
men
fired
boldly
among
them
,
and
wounded
*NL*
the
mate
with
a
musket
ball
,
which
broke
his
arm
,
and
wounded
two
more
of
*NL*
the
men
,
but
killed
nobody
.
The
mate
,
calling
for
help
,
rushed
,
however
,
*NL*
into
the
round-house
,
wounded
as
he
was
,
and
,
with
his
pistol
,
shot
the
*NL*
new
captain
through
the
head
,
the
bullet
entering
at
his
mouth
,
and
came
*NL*
out
again
behind
one
of
his
ears
,
so
that
he
never
spoke
a
word
more
:
*NL*
upon
which
the
rest
yielded
,
and
the
ship
was
taken
effectually
,
without
*NL*
any
more
lives
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
ship
was
thus
secured
,
the
captain
ordered
seven
guns
to
*NL*
be
fired
,
which
was
the
signal
agreed
upon
with
me
to
give
me
notice
of
*NL*
his
success
,
which
,
you
may
be
sure
,
I
was
very
glad
to
hear
,
having
sat
*NL*
watching
upon
the
shore
for
it
till
near
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
Having
thus
heard
the
signal
plainly
,
I
laid
me
down
;
and
it
having
been
*NL*
a
day
of
great
fatigue
to
me
,
I
slept
very
sound
,
till
I
was
surprised
*NL*
with
the
noise
of
a
gun
;
and
presently
starting
up
,
I
heard
a
man
call
me
*NL*
by
the
name
of
``
Governor
!
Governor
!
''
and
presently
I
knew
the
captain
's
*NL*
voice
;
when
,
climbing
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
there
he
stood
,
and
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
ship
,
he
embraced
me
in
his
arms
,
``
My
dear
friend
and
*NL*
deliverer
,
''
says
he
,
``
there
's
your
ship
;
for
she
is
all
yours
,
and
so
are
*NL*
we
,
and
all
that
belong
to
her
.
''
I
cast
my
eyes
to
the
ship
,
and
there
*NL*
she
rode
,
within
little
more
than
half
a
mile
of
the
shore
;
for
they
had
*NL*
weighed
her
anchor
as
soon
as
they
were
masters
of
her
,
and
,
the
weather
*NL*
being
fair
,
had
brought
her
to
an
anchor
just
against
the
mouth
of
the
*NL*
little
creek
;
and
the
tide
being
up
,
the
captain
had
brought
the
pinnace
*NL*
in
near
the
place
where
I
had
first
landed
my
rafts
,
and
so
landed
just
*NL*
at
my
door
.
I
was
at
first
ready
to
sink
down
with
the
surprise
;
for
I
*NL*
saw
my
deliverance
,
indeed
,
visibly
put
into
my
hands
,
all
things
easy
,
*NL*
and
a
large
ship
just
ready
to
carry
me
away
whither
I
pleased
to
go
.
At
*NL*
first
,
for
some
time
,
I
was
not
able
to
answer
him
one
word
;
but
as
he
*NL*
had
taken
me
in
his
arms
I
held
fast
by
him
,
or
I
should
have
fallen
to
*NL*
the
ground
.
He
perceived
the
surprise
,
and
immediately
pulled
a
bottle
*NL*
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
me
a
dram
of
cordial
,
which
he
had
brought
on
*NL*
purpose
for
me
.
After
I
had
drunk
it
,
I
sat
down
upon
the
ground
;
and
*NL*
though
it
brought
me
to
myself
,
yet
it
was
a
good
while
before
I
could
*NL*
speak
a
word
to
him
.
All
this
time
the
poor
man
was
in
as
great
an
*NL*
ecstasy
as
I
,
only
not
under
any
surprise
as
I
was
;
and
he
said
a
*NL*
thousand
kind
and
tender
things
to
me
,
to
compose
and
bring
me
to
myself
;
*NL*
but
such
was
the
flood
of
joy
in
my
breast
,
that
it
put
all
my
spirits
*NL*
into
confusion
:
at
last
it
broke
out
into
tears
,
and
in
a
little
while
*NL*
after
I
recovered
my
speech
;
I
then
took
my
turn
,
and
embraced
him
as
my
*NL*
deliverer
,
and
we
rejoiced
together
.
I
told
him
I
looked
upon
him
as
a
*NL*
man
sent
by
Heaven
to
deliver
me
,
and
that
the
whole
transaction
seemed
*NL*
to
be
a
chain
of
wonders
;
that
such
things
as
these
were
the
testimonies
*NL*
we
had
of
a
secret
hand
of
Providence
governing
the
world
,
and
an
*NL*
evidence
that
the
eye
of
an
infinite
Power
could
search
into
the
remotest
*NL*
corner
of
the
world
,
and
send
help
to
the
miserable
whenever
He
pleased
.
*NL*
I
forgot
not
to
lift
up
my
heart
in
thankfulness
to
Heaven
;
and
what
*NL*
heart
could
forbear
to
bless
Him
,
who
had
not
only
in
a
miraculous
manner
*NL*
provided
for
me
in
such
a
wilderness
,
and
in
such
a
desolate
condition
,
*NL*
but
from
whom
every
deliverance
must
always
be
acknowledged
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
talked
a
while
,
the
captain
told
me
he
had
brought
me
some
*NL*
little
refreshment
,
such
as
the
ship
afforded
,
and
such
as
the
wretches
*NL*
that
had
been
so
long
his
masters
had
not
plundered
him
of
.
Upon
this
,
*NL*
he
called
aloud
to
the
boat
,
and
bade
his
men
bring
the
things
ashore
*NL*
that
were
for
the
governor
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
was
a
present
as
if
I
had
*NL*
been
one
that
was
not
to
be
carried
away
with
them
,
but
as
if
I
had
been
*NL*
to
dwell
upon
the
island
still
.
First
,
he
had
brought
me
a
case
of
*NL*
bottles
full
of
excellent
cordial
waters
,
six
large
bottles
of
Madeira
*NL*
wine
-LRB-
the
bottles
held
two
quarts
each
-RRB-
,
two
pounds
of
excellent
good
*NL*
tobacco
,
twelve
good
pieces
of
the
ship
's
beef
,
and
six
pieces
of
pork
,
*NL*
with
a
bag
of
peas
,
and
about
a
hundred-weight
of
biscuit
;
he
also
*NL*
brought
me
a
box
of
sugar
,
a
box
of
flour
,
a
bag
full
of
lemons
,
and
two
*NL*
bottles
of
lime-juice
,
and
abundance
of
other
things
.
But
besides
these
,
*NL*
and
what
was
a
thousand
times
more
useful
to
me
,
he
brought
me
six
new
*NL*
clean
shirts
,
six
very
good
neckcloths
,
two
pair
of
gloves
,
one
pair
of
*NL*
shoes
,
a
hat
,
and
one
pair
of
stockings
,
with
a
very
good
suit
of
clothes
*NL*
of
his
own
,
which
had
been
worn
but
very
little
:
in
a
word
,
he
clothed
me
*NL*
from
head
to
foot
.
It
was
a
very
kind
and
agreeable
present
,
as
any
one
*NL*
may
imagine
,
to
one
in
my
circumstances
,
but
never
was
anything
in
the
*NL*
world
of
that
kind
so
unpleasant
,
awkward
,
and
uneasy
as
it
was
to
me
to
*NL*
wear
such
clothes
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
ceremonies
were
past
,
and
after
all
his
good
things
were
*NL*
brought
into
my
little
apartment
,
we
began
to
consult
what
was
to
be
done
*NL*
with
the
prisoners
we
had
;
for
it
was
worth
considering
whether
we
might
*NL*
venture
to
take
them
with
us
or
no
,
especially
two
of
them
,
whom
he
knew
*NL*
to
be
incorrigible
and
refractory
to
the
last
degree
;
and
the
captain
*NL*
said
he
knew
they
were
such
rogues
that
there
was
no
obliging
them
,
and
*NL*
if
he
did
carry
them
away
,
it
must
be
in
irons
,
as
malefactors
,
to
be
*NL*
delivered
over
to
justice
at
the
first
English
colony
he
could
come
to
;
*NL*
and
I
found
that
the
captain
himself
was
very
anxious
about
it
.
Upon
*NL*
this
,
I
told
him
that
,
if
he
desired
it
,
I
would
undertake
to
bring
the
*NL*
two
men
he
spoke
of
to
make
it
their
own
request
that
he
should
leave
*NL*
them
upon
the
island
.
``
I
should
be
very
glad
of
that
,
''
says
the
captain
,
*NL*
``
with
all
my
heart
.
''
``
Well
,
''
says
I
,
``
I
will
send
for
them
up
and
talk
*NL*
with
them
for
you
.
''
So
I
caused
Friday
and
the
two
hostages
,
for
they
*NL*
were
now
discharged
,
their
comrades
having
performed
their
promise
;
I
*NL*
say
,
I
caused
them
to
go
to
the
cave
,
and
bring
up
the
five
men
,
pinioned
*NL*
as
they
were
,
to
the
bower
,
and
keep
them
there
till
I
came
.
After
some
*NL*
time
,
I
came
thither
dressed
in
my
new
habit
;
and
now
I
was
called
*NL*
governor
again
.
Being
all
met
,
and
the
captain
with
me
,
I
caused
the
men
*NL*
to
be
brought
before
me
,
and
I
told
them
I
had
got
a
full
account
of
*NL*
their
villainous
behaviour
to
the
captain
,
and
how
they
had
run
away
with
*NL*
the
ship
,
and
were
preparing
to
commit
further
robberies
,
but
that
*NL*
Providence
had
ensnared
them
in
their
own
ways
,
and
that
they
were
fallen
*NL*
into
the
pit
which
they
had
dug
for
others
.
I
let
them
know
that
by
my
*NL*
direction
the
ship
had
been
seized
;
that
she
lay
now
in
the
road
;
and
*NL*
they
might
see
by-and-by
that
their
new
captain
had
received
the
reward
*NL*
of
his
villainy
,
and
that
they
would
see
him
hanging
at
the
yard-arm
;
*NL*
that
,
as
to
them
,
I
wanted
to
know
what
they
had
to
say
why
I
should
not
*NL*
execute
them
as
pirates
taken
in
the
fact
,
as
by
my
commission
they
could
*NL*
not
doubt
but
I
had
authority
so
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
answered
in
the
name
of
the
rest
,
that
they
had
nothing
to
*NL*
say
but
this
,
that
when
they
were
taken
the
captain
promised
them
their
*NL*
lives
,
and
they
humbly
implored
my
mercy
.
But
I
told
them
I
knew
not
*NL*
what
mercy
to
show
them
;
for
as
for
myself
,
I
had
resolved
to
quit
the
*NL*
island
with
all
my
men
,
and
had
taken
passage
with
the
captain
to
go
to
*NL*
England
;
and
as
for
the
captain
,
he
could
not
carry
them
to
England
other
*NL*
than
as
prisoners
in
irons
,
to
be
tried
for
mutiny
and
running
away
with
*NL*
the
ship
;
the
consequence
of
which
,
they
must
needs
know
,
would
be
the
*NL*
gallows
;
so
that
I
could
not
tell
what
was
best
for
them
,
unless
they
had
*NL*
a
mind
to
take
their
fate
in
the
island
.
If
they
desired
that
,
as
I
had
*NL*
liberty
to
leave
the
island
,
I
had
some
inclination
to
give
them
their
*NL*
lives
,
if
they
thought
they
could
shift
on
shore
.
They
seemed
very
*NL*
thankful
for
it
,
and
said
they
would
much
rather
venture
to
stay
there
*NL*
than
be
carried
to
England
to
be
hanged
.
So
I
left
it
on
that
issue
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
captain
seemed
to
make
some
difficulty
of
it
,
as
if
he
durst
*NL*
not
leave
them
there
.
Upon
this
I
seemed
a
little
angry
with
the
*NL*
captain
,
and
told
him
that
they
were
my
prisoners
,
not
his
;
and
that
*NL*
seeing
I
had
offered
them
so
much
favour
,
I
would
be
as
good
as
my
word
;
*NL*
and
that
if
he
did
not
think
fit
to
consent
to
it
I
would
set
them
at
*NL*
liberty
,
as
I
found
them
:
and
if
he
did
not
like
it
he
might
take
them
*NL*
again
if
he
could
catch
them
.
Upon
this
they
appeared
very
thankful
,
and
*NL*
I
accordingly
set
them
at
liberty
,
and
bade
them
retire
into
the
woods
,
*NL*
to
the
place
whence
they
came
,
and
I
would
leave
them
some
firearms
,
some
*NL*
ammunition
,
and
some
directions
how
they
should
live
very
well
if
they
*NL*
thought
fit
.
Upon
this
I
prepared
to
go
on
board
the
ship
;
but
told
the
*NL*
captain
I
would
stay
that
night
to
prepare
my
things
,
and
desired
him
to
*NL*
go
on
board
in
the
meantime
,
and
keep
all
right
in
the
ship
,
and
send
the
*NL*
boat
on
shore
next
day
for
me
;
ordering
him
,
at
all
events
,
to
cause
the
*NL*
new
captain
,
who
was
killed
,
to
be
hanged
at
the
yard-arm
,
that
these
men
*NL*
might
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
captain
was
gone
I
sent
for
the
men
up
to
me
to
my
apartment
,
*NL*
and
entered
seriously
into
discourse
with
them
on
their
circumstances
.
I
*NL*
told
them
I
thought
they
had
made
a
right
choice
;
that
if
the
captain
had
*NL*
carried
them
away
they
would
certainly
be
hanged
.
I
showed
them
the
new
*NL*
captain
hanging
at
the
yard-arm
of
the
ship
,
and
told
them
they
had
*NL*
nothing
less
to
expect
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
all
declared
their
willingness
to
stay
,
I
then
told
them
I
*NL*
would
let
them
into
the
story
of
my
living
there
,
and
put
them
into
the
*NL*
way
of
making
it
easy
to
them
.
Accordingly
,
I
gave
them
the
whole
*NL*
history
of
the
place
,
and
of
my
coming
to
it
;
showed
them
my
*NL*
fortifications
,
the
way
I
made
my
bread
,
planted
my
corn
,
cured
my
*NL*
grapes
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
all
that
was
necessary
to
make
them
easy
.
I
told
*NL*
them
the
story
also
of
the
seventeen
Spaniards
that
were
to
be
expected
,
*NL*
for
whom
I
left
a
letter
,
and
made
them
promise
to
treat
them
in
common
*NL*
with
themselves
.
Here
it
may
be
noted
that
the
captain
,
who
had
ink
on
*NL*
board
,
was
greatly
surprised
that
I
never
hit
upon
a
way
of
making
ink
of
*NL*
charcoal
and
water
,
or
of
something
else
,
as
I
had
done
things
much
more
*NL*
difficult
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
them
my
firearms
--
viz
.
five
muskets
,
three
fowling-pieces
,
and
*NL*
three
swords
.
I
had
above
a
barrel
and
a
half
of
powder
left
;
for
after
*NL*
the
first
year
or
two
I
used
but
little
,
and
wasted
none
.
I
gave
them
a
*NL*
description
of
the
way
I
managed
the
goats
,
and
directions
to
milk
and
*NL*
fatten
them
,
and
to
make
both
butter
and
cheese
.
In
a
word
,
I
gave
them
*NL*
every
part
of
my
own
story
;
and
told
them
I
should
prevail
with
the
*NL*
captain
to
leave
them
two
barrels
of
gunpowder
more
,
and
some
*NL*
garden-seeds
,
which
I
told
them
I
would
have
been
very
glad
of
.
Also
,
I
*NL*
gave
them
the
bag
of
peas
which
the
captain
had
brought
me
to
eat
,
and
*NL*
bade
them
be
sure
to
sow
and
increase
them
.

CHAPTER
XIX
--
RETURN
TO
ENGLAND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Having
done
all
this
I
left
them
the
next
day
,
and
went
on
board
the
*NL*
ship
.
We
prepared
immediately
to
sail
,
but
did
not
weigh
that
night
.
*NL*
The
next
morning
early
,
two
of
the
five
men
came
swimming
to
the
ship
's
*NL*
side
,
and
making
the
most
lamentable
complaint
of
the
other
three
,
begged
*NL*
to
be
taken
into
the
ship
for
God
's
sake
,
for
they
should
be
murdered
,
*NL*
and
begged
the
captain
to
take
them
on
board
,
though
he
hanged
them
*NL*
immediately
.
Upon
this
the
captain
pretended
to
have
no
power
without
*NL*
me
;
but
after
some
difficulty
,
and
after
their
solemn
promises
of
*NL*
amendment
,
they
were
taken
on
board
,
and
were
,
some
time
after
,
soundly
*NL*
whipped
and
pickled
;
after
which
they
proved
very
honest
and
quiet
*NL*
fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
this
,
the
boat
was
ordered
on
shore
,
the
tide
being
up
,
*NL*
with
the
things
promised
to
the
men
;
to
which
the
captain
,
at
my
*NL*
intercession
,
caused
their
chests
and
clothes
to
be
added
,
which
they
*NL*
took
,
and
were
very
thankful
for
.
I
also
encouraged
them
,
by
telling
*NL*
them
that
if
it
lay
in
my
power
to
send
any
vessel
to
take
them
in
,
I
*NL*
would
not
forget
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
took
leave
of
this
island
,
I
carried
on
board
,
for
relics
,
the
*NL*
great
goat-skin
cap
I
had
made
,
my
umbrella
,
and
one
of
my
parrots
;
also
,
*NL*
I
forgot
not
to
take
the
money
I
formerly
mentioned
,
which
had
lain
by
me
*NL*
so
long
useless
that
it
was
grown
rusty
or
tarnished
,
and
could
hardly
*NL*
pass
for
silver
till
it
had
been
a
little
rubbed
and
handled
,
as
also
the
*NL*
money
I
found
in
the
wreck
of
the
Spanish
ship
.
And
thus
I
left
the
*NL*
island
,
the
19th
of
December
,
as
I
found
by
the
ship
's
account
,
in
the
*NL*
year
1686
,
after
I
had
been
upon
it
eight-and-twenty
years
,
two
months
,
*NL*
and
nineteen
days
;
being
delivered
from
this
second
captivity
the
same
*NL*
day
of
the
month
that
I
first
made
my
escape
in
the
long-boat
from
among
*NL*
the
Moors
of
Sallee
.
In
this
vessel
,
after
a
long
voyage
,
I
arrived
in
*NL*
England
the
11th
of
June
,
in
the
year
1687
,
having
been
thirty-five
years
*NL*
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
England
I
was
as
perfect
a
stranger
to
all
the
world
as
if
*NL*
I
had
never
been
known
there
.
My
benefactor
and
faithful
steward
,
whom
I
*NL*
had
left
my
money
in
trust
with
,
was
alive
,
but
had
had
great
misfortunes
*NL*
in
the
world
;
was
become
a
widow
the
second
time
,
and
very
low
in
the
*NL*
world
.
I
made
her
very
easy
as
to
what
she
owed
me
,
assuring
her
I
would
*NL*
give
her
no
trouble
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
in
gratitude
for
her
former
*NL*
care
and
faithfulness
to
me
,
I
relieved
her
as
my
little
stock
would
*NL*
afford
;
which
at
that
time
would
,
indeed
,
allow
me
to
do
but
little
for
*NL*
her
;
but
I
assured
her
I
would
never
forget
her
former
kindness
to
me
;
*NL*
nor
did
I
forget
her
when
I
had
sufficient
to
help
her
,
as
shall
be
*NL*
observed
in
its
proper
place
.
I
went
down
afterwards
into
Yorkshire
;
but
*NL*
my
father
was
dead
,
and
my
mother
and
all
the
family
extinct
,
except
that
*NL*
I
found
two
sisters
,
and
two
of
the
children
of
one
of
my
brothers
;
and
*NL*
as
I
had
been
long
ago
given
over
for
dead
,
there
had
been
no
provision
*NL*
made
for
me
;
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
I
found
nothing
to
relieve
or
assist
me
;
*NL*
and
that
the
little
money
I
had
would
not
do
much
for
me
as
to
settling
*NL*
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
met
with
one
piece
of
gratitude
indeed
,
which
I
did
not
expect
;
and
*NL*
this
was
,
that
the
master
of
the
ship
,
whom
I
had
so
happily
delivered
,
*NL*
and
by
the
same
means
saved
the
ship
and
cargo
,
having
given
a
very
*NL*
handsome
account
to
the
owners
of
the
manner
how
I
had
saved
the
lives
of
*NL*
the
men
and
the
ship
,
they
invited
me
to
meet
them
and
some
other
*NL*
merchants
concerned
,
and
all
together
made
me
a
very
handsome
compliment
*NL*
upon
the
subject
,
and
a
present
of
almost
200
pounds
sterling
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
making
several
reflections
upon
the
circumstances
of
my
life
,
*NL*
and
how
little
way
this
would
go
towards
settling
me
in
the
world
,
I
*NL*
resolved
to
go
to
Lisbon
,
and
see
if
I
might
not
come
at
some
information
*NL*
of
the
state
of
my
plantation
in
the
Brazils
,
and
of
what
was
become
of
*NL*
my
partner
,
who
,
I
had
reason
to
suppose
,
had
some
years
past
given
me
*NL*
over
for
dead
.
With
this
view
I
took
shipping
for
Lisbon
,
where
I
*NL*
arrived
in
April
following
,
my
man
Friday
accompanying
me
very
honestly
*NL*
in
all
these
ramblings
,
and
proving
a
most
faithful
servant
upon
all
*NL*
occasions
.
When
I
came
to
Lisbon
,
I
found
out
,
by
inquiry
,
and
to
my
*NL*
particular
satisfaction
,
my
old
friend
,
the
captain
of
the
ship
who
first
*NL*
took
me
up
at
sea
off
the
shore
of
Africa
.
He
was
now
grown
old
,
and
had
*NL*
left
off
going
to
sea
,
having
put
his
son
,
who
was
far
from
a
young
man
,
*NL*
into
his
ship
,
and
who
still
used
the
Brazil
trade
.
The
old
man
did
not
*NL*
know
me
,
and
indeed
I
hardly
knew
him
.
But
I
soon
brought
him
to
my
*NL*
remembrance
,
and
as
soon
brought
myself
to
his
remembrance
,
when
I
told
*NL*
him
who
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
passionate
expressions
of
the
old
acquaintance
between
us
,
I
*NL*
inquired
,
you
may
be
sure
,
after
my
plantation
and
my
partner
.
The
old
*NL*
man
told
me
he
had
not
been
in
the
Brazils
for
about
nine
years
;
but
that
*NL*
he
could
assure
me
that
when
he
came
away
my
partner
was
living
,
but
the
*NL*
trustees
whom
I
had
joined
with
him
to
take
cognisance
of
my
part
were
*NL*
both
dead
:
that
,
however
,
he
believed
I
would
have
a
very
good
account
of
*NL*
the
improvement
of
the
plantation
;
for
that
,
upon
the
general
belief
of
*NL*
my
being
cast
away
and
drowned
,
my
trustees
had
given
in
the
account
of
*NL*
the
produce
of
my
part
of
the
plantation
to
the
procurator-fiscal
,
who
*NL*
had
appropriated
it
,
in
case
I
never
came
to
claim
it
,
one-third
to
the
*NL*
king
,
and
two-thirds
to
the
monastery
of
St.
Augustine
,
to
be
expended
*NL*
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
,
and
for
the
conversion
of
the
Indians
to
the
*NL*
Catholic
faith
:
but
that
,
if
I
appeared
,
or
any
one
for
me
,
to
claim
the
*NL*
inheritance
,
it
would
be
restored
;
only
that
the
improvement
,
or
annual
*NL*
production
,
being
distributed
to
charitable
uses
,
could
not
be
restored
:
*NL*
but
he
assured
me
that
the
steward
of
the
king
's
revenue
from
lands
,
and
*NL*
the
providore
,
or
steward
of
the
monastery
,
had
taken
great
care
all
*NL*
along
that
the
incumbent
,
that
is
to
say
my
partner
,
gave
every
year
a
*NL*
faithful
account
of
the
produce
,
of
which
they
had
duly
received
my
*NL*
moiety
.
I
asked
him
if
he
knew
to
what
height
of
improvement
he
had
*NL*
brought
the
plantation
,
and
whether
he
thought
it
might
be
worth
looking
*NL*
after
;
or
whether
,
on
my
going
thither
,
I
should
meet
with
any
*NL*
obstruction
to
my
possessing
my
just
right
in
the
moiety
.
He
told
me
he
*NL*
could
not
tell
exactly
to
what
degree
the
plantation
was
improved
;
but
*NL*
this
he
knew
,
that
my
partner
was
grown
exceeding
rich
upon
the
enjoying
*NL*
his
part
of
it
;
and
that
,
to
the
best
of
his
remembrance
,
he
had
heard
*NL*
that
the
king
's
third
of
my
part
,
which
was
,
it
seems
,
granted
away
to
*NL*
some
other
monastery
or
religious
house
,
amounted
to
above
two
hundred
*NL*
moidores
a
year
:
that
as
to
my
being
restored
to
a
quiet
possession
of
*NL*
it
,
there
was
no
question
to
be
made
of
that
,
my
partner
being
alive
to
*NL*
witness
my
title
,
and
my
name
being
also
enrolled
in
the
register
of
the
*NL*
country
;
also
he
told
me
that
the
survivors
of
my
two
trustees
were
very
*NL*
fair
,
honest
people
,
and
very
wealthy
;
and
he
believed
I
would
not
only
*NL*
have
their
assistance
for
putting
me
in
possession
,
but
would
find
a
very
*NL*
considerable
sum
of
money
in
their
hands
for
my
account
,
being
the
*NL*
produce
of
the
farm
while
their
fathers
held
the
trust
,
and
before
it
was
*NL*
given
up
,
as
above
;
which
,
as
he
remembered
,
was
for
about
twelve
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
showed
myself
a
little
concerned
and
uneasy
at
this
account
,
and
*NL*
inquired
of
the
old
captain
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
trustees
should
*NL*
thus
dispose
of
my
effects
,
when
he
knew
that
I
had
made
my
will
,
and
had
*NL*
made
him
,
the
Portuguese
captain
,
my
universal
heir
,
&
c
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
that
was
true
;
but
that
as
there
was
no
proof
of
my
being
*NL*
dead
,
he
could
not
act
as
executor
until
some
certain
account
should
come
*NL*
of
my
death
;
and
,
besides
,
he
was
not
willing
to
intermeddle
with
a
thing
*NL*
so
remote
:
that
it
was
true
he
had
registered
my
will
,
and
put
in
his
*NL*
claim
;
and
could
he
have
given
any
account
of
my
being
dead
or
alive
,
he
*NL*
would
have
acted
by
procuration
,
and
taken
possession
of
the
ingenio
-LRB-
so
*NL*
they
call
the
sugar-house
-RRB-
,
and
have
given
his
son
,
who
was
now
at
the
*NL*
Brazils
,
orders
to
do
it
.
``
But
,
''
says
the
old
man
,
``
I
have
one
piece
of
*NL*
news
to
tell
you
,
which
perhaps
may
not
be
so
acceptable
to
you
as
the
*NL*
rest
;
and
that
is
,
believing
you
were
lost
,
and
all
the
world
believing
*NL*
so
also
,
your
partner
and
trustees
did
offer
to
account
with
me
,
in
your
*NL*
name
,
for
the
first
six
or
eight
years
'
profits
,
which
I
received
.
There
*NL*
being
at
that
time
great
disbursements
for
increasing
the
works
,
building
*NL*
an
ingenio
,
and
buying
slaves
,
it
did
not
amount
to
near
so
much
as
*NL*
afterwards
it
produced
;
however
,
''
says
the
old
man
,
``
I
shall
give
you
a
*NL*
true
account
of
what
I
have
received
in
all
,
and
how
I
have
disposed
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
days
'
further
conference
with
this
ancient
friend
,
he
brought
*NL*
me
an
account
of
the
first
six
years
'
income
of
my
plantation
,
signed
by
*NL*
my
partner
and
the
merchant-trustees
,
being
always
delivered
in
goods
,
*NL*
viz
.
tobacco
in
roll
,
and
sugar
in
chests
,
besides
rum
,
molasses
,
&
c.
,
*NL*
which
is
the
consequence
of
a
sugar-work
;
and
I
found
by
this
account
,
*NL*
that
every
year
the
income
considerably
increased
;
but
,
as
above
,
the
*NL*
disbursements
being
large
,
the
sum
at
first
was
small
:
however
,
the
old
*NL*
man
let
me
see
that
he
was
debtor
to
me
four
hundred
and
seventy
moidores
*NL*
of
gold
,
besides
sixty
chests
of
sugar
and
fifteen
double
rolls
of
*NL*
tobacco
,
which
were
lost
in
his
ship
;
he
having
been
shipwrecked
coming
*NL*
home
to
Lisbon
,
about
eleven
years
after
my
having
the
place
.
The
good
*NL*
man
then
began
to
complain
of
his
misfortunes
,
and
how
he
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
make
use
of
my
money
to
recover
his
losses
,
and
buy
him
a
*NL*
share
in
a
new
ship
.
``
However
,
my
old
friend
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
shall
not
*NL*
want
a
supply
in
your
necessity
;
and
as
soon
as
my
son
returns
you
shall
*NL*
be
fully
satisfied
.
''
Upon
this
he
pulls
out
an
old
pouch
,
and
gives
me
*NL*
one
hundred
and
sixty
Portugal
moidores
in
gold
;
and
giving
the
writings
*NL*
of
his
title
to
the
ship
,
which
his
son
was
gone
to
the
Brazils
in
,
of
*NL*
which
he
was
quarter-part
owner
,
and
his
son
another
,
he
puts
them
both
*NL*
into
my
hands
for
security
of
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
too
much
moved
with
the
honesty
and
kindness
of
the
poor
man
to
be
*NL*
able
to
bear
this
;
and
remembering
what
he
had
done
for
me
,
how
he
had
*NL*
taken
me
up
at
sea
,
and
how
generously
he
had
used
me
on
all
occasions
,
*NL*
and
particularly
how
sincere
a
friend
he
was
now
to
me
,
I
could
hardly
*NL*
refrain
weeping
at
what
he
had
said
to
me
;
therefore
I
asked
him
if
his
*NL*
circumstances
admitted
him
to
spare
so
much
money
at
that
time
,
and
if
it
*NL*
would
not
straiten
him
?
He
told
me
he
could
not
say
but
it
might
*NL*
straiten
him
a
little
;
but
,
however
,
it
was
my
money
,
and
I
might
want
it
*NL*
more
than
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
the
good
man
said
was
full
of
affection
,
and
I
could
hardly
*NL*
refrain
from
tears
while
he
spoke
;
in
short
,
I
took
one
hundred
of
the
*NL*
moidores
,
and
called
for
a
pen
and
ink
to
give
him
a
receipt
for
them
:
*NL*
then
I
returned
him
the
rest
,
and
told
him
if
ever
I
had
possession
of
*NL*
the
plantation
I
would
return
the
other
to
him
also
-LRB-
as
,
indeed
,
I
*NL*
afterwards
did
-RRB-
;
and
that
as
to
the
bill
of
sale
of
his
part
in
his
son
's
*NL*
ship
,
I
would
not
take
it
by
any
means
;
but
that
if
I
wanted
the
money
,
I
*NL*
found
he
was
honest
enough
to
pay
me
;
and
if
I
did
not
,
but
came
to
*NL*
receive
what
he
gave
me
reason
to
expect
,
I
would
never
have
a
penny
more
*NL*
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
was
past
,
the
old
man
asked
me
if
he
should
put
me
into
a
*NL*
method
to
make
my
claim
to
my
plantation
.
I
told
him
I
thought
to
go
*NL*
over
to
it
myself
.
He
said
I
might
do
so
if
I
pleased
,
but
that
if
I
did
*NL*
not
,
there
were
ways
enough
to
secure
my
right
,
and
immediately
to
*NL*
appropriate
the
profits
to
my
use
:
and
as
there
were
ships
in
the
river
*NL*
of
Lisbon
just
ready
to
go
away
to
Brazil
,
he
made
me
enter
my
name
in
a
*NL*
public
register
,
with
his
affidavit
,
affirming
,
upon
oath
,
that
I
was
*NL*
alive
,
and
that
I
was
the
same
person
who
took
up
the
land
for
the
*NL*
planting
the
said
plantation
at
first
.
This
being
regularly
attested
by
*NL*
a
notary
,
and
a
procuration
affixed
,
he
directed
me
to
send
it
,
with
a
*NL*
letter
of
his
writing
,
to
a
merchant
of
his
acquaintance
at
the
place
;
*NL*
and
then
proposed
my
staying
with
him
till
an
account
came
of
the
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
was
anything
more
honourable
than
the
proceedings
upon
this
*NL*
procuration
;
for
in
less
than
seven
months
I
received
a
large
packet
from
*NL*
the
survivors
of
my
trustees
,
the
merchants
,
for
whose
account
I
went
to
*NL*
sea
,
in
which
were
the
following
,
particular
letters
and
papers
*NL*
enclosed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
there
was
the
account-current
of
the
produce
of
my
farm
or
*NL*
plantation
,
from
the
year
when
their
fathers
had
balanced
with
my
old
*NL*
Portugal
captain
,
being
for
six
years
;
the
balance
appeared
to
be
one
*NL*
thousand
one
hundred
and
seventy-four
moidores
in
my
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Secondly
,
there
was
the
account
of
four
years
more
,
while
they
kept
the
*NL*
effects
in
their
hands
,
before
the
government
claimed
the
administration
,
*NL*
as
being
the
effects
of
a
person
not
to
be
found
,
which
they
called
civil
*NL*
death
;
and
the
balance
of
this
,
the
value
of
the
plantation
increasing
,
*NL*
amounted
to
nineteen
thousand
four
hundred
and
forty-six
crusadoes
,
being
*NL*
about
three
thousand
two
hundred
and
forty
moidores
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thirdly
,
there
was
the
Prior
of
St.
Augustine
's
account
,
who
had
received
*NL*
the
profits
for
above
fourteen
years
;
but
not
being
able
to
account
for
*NL*
what
was
disposed
of
by
the
hospital
,
very
honestly
declared
he
had
eight
*NL*
hundred
and
seventy-two
moidores
not
distributed
,
which
he
acknowledged
*NL*
to
my
account
:
as
to
the
king
's
part
,
that
refunded
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
letter
of
my
partner
's
,
congratulating
me
very
affectionately
*NL*
upon
my
being
alive
,
giving
me
an
account
how
the
estate
was
improved
,
*NL*
and
what
it
produced
a
year
;
with
the
particulars
of
the
number
of
*NL*
squares
,
or
acres
that
it
contained
,
how
planted
,
how
many
slaves
there
*NL*
were
upon
it
:
and
making
two-and-twenty
crosses
for
blessings
,
told
me
he
*NL*
had
said
so
many
_
Ave
Marias
_
to
thank
the
Blessed
Virgin
that
I
was
*NL*
alive
;
inviting
me
very
passionately
to
come
over
and
take
possession
of
*NL*
my
own
,
and
in
the
meantime
to
give
him
orders
to
whom
he
should
deliver
*NL*
my
effects
if
I
did
not
come
myself
;
concluding
with
a
hearty
tender
of
*NL*
his
friendship
,
and
that
of
his
family
;
and
sent
me
as
a
present
seven
*NL*
fine
leopards
'
skins
,
which
he
had
,
it
seems
,
received
from
Africa
,
by
*NL*
some
other
ship
that
he
had
sent
thither
,
and
which
,
it
seems
,
had
made
a
*NL*
better
voyage
than
I
.
He
sent
me
also
five
chests
of
excellent
*NL*
sweetmeats
,
and
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
uncoined
,
not
quite
so
large
as
*NL*
moidores
.
By
the
same
fleet
my
two
merchant-trustees
shipped
me
one
*NL*
thousand
two
hundred
chests
of
sugar
,
eight
hundred
rolls
of
tobacco
,
and
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
whole
account
in
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
might
well
say
now
,
indeed
,
that
the
latter
end
of
Job
was
better
than
*NL*
the
beginning
.
It
is
impossible
to
express
the
flutterings
of
my
very
*NL*
heart
when
I
found
all
my
wealth
about
me
;
for
as
the
Brazil
ships
come
*NL*
all
in
fleets
,
the
same
ships
which
brought
my
letters
brought
my
goods
:
*NL*
and
the
effects
were
safe
in
the
river
before
the
letters
came
to
my
*NL*
hand
.
In
a
word
,
I
turned
pale
,
and
grew
sick
;
and
,
had
not
the
old
man
*NL*
run
and
fetched
me
a
cordial
,
I
believe
the
sudden
surprise
of
joy
had
*NL*
overset
nature
,
and
I
had
died
upon
the
spot
:
nay
,
after
that
I
continued
*NL*
very
ill
,
and
was
so
some
hours
,
till
a
physician
being
sent
for
,
and
*NL*
something
of
the
real
cause
of
my
illness
being
known
,
he
ordered
me
to
*NL*
be
let
blood
;
after
which
I
had
relief
,
and
grew
well
:
but
I
verily
*NL*
believe
,
if
I
had
not
been
eased
by
a
vent
given
in
that
manner
to
the
*NL*
spirits
,
I
should
have
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
master
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
of
above
five
thousand
pounds
sterling
*NL*
in
money
,
and
had
an
estate
,
as
I
might
well
call
it
,
in
the
Brazils
,
of
*NL*
above
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
as
sure
as
an
estate
of
lands
in
England
:
*NL*
and
,
in
a
word
,
I
was
in
a
condition
which
I
scarce
knew
how
to
*NL*
understand
,
or
how
to
compose
myself
for
the
enjoyment
of
it
.
The
first
*NL*
thing
I
did
was
to
recompense
my
original
benefactor
,
my
good
old
*NL*
captain
,
who
had
been
first
charitable
to
me
in
my
distress
,
kind
to
me
*NL*
in
my
beginning
,
and
honest
to
me
at
the
end
.
I
showed
him
all
that
was
*NL*
sent
to
me
;
I
told
him
that
,
next
to
the
providence
of
Heaven
,
which
*NL*
disposed
all
things
,
it
was
owing
to
him
;
and
that
it
now
lay
on
me
to
*NL*
reward
him
,
which
I
would
do
a
hundred-fold
:
so
I
first
returned
to
him
*NL*
the
hundred
moidores
I
had
received
of
him
;
then
I
sent
for
a
notary
,
and
*NL*
caused
him
to
draw
up
a
general
release
or
discharge
from
the
four
*NL*
hundred
and
seventy
moidores
,
which
he
had
acknowledged
he
owed
me
,
in
*NL*
the
fullest
and
firmest
manner
possible
.
After
which
I
caused
a
*NL*
procuration
to
be
drawn
,
empowering
him
to
be
the
receiver
of
the
annual
*NL*
profits
of
my
plantation
:
and
appointing
my
partner
to
account
with
him
,
*NL*
and
make
the
returns
,
by
the
usual
fleets
,
to
him
in
my
name
;
and
by
a
*NL*
clause
in
the
end
,
made
a
grant
of
one
hundred
moidores
a
year
to
him
*NL*
during
his
life
,
out
of
the
effects
,
and
fifty
moidores
a
year
to
his
son
*NL*
after
him
,
for
his
life
:
and
thus
I
requited
my
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
to
consider
which
way
to
steer
my
course
next
,
and
what
to
do
*NL*
with
the
estate
that
Providence
had
thus
put
into
my
hands
;
and
,
indeed
,
*NL*
I
had
more
care
upon
my
head
now
than
I
had
in
my
state
of
life
in
the
*NL*
island
where
I
wanted
nothing
but
what
I
had
,
and
had
nothing
but
what
I
*NL*
wanted
;
whereas
I
had
now
a
great
charge
upon
me
,
and
my
business
was
how
*NL*
to
secure
it
.
I
had
not
a
cave
now
to
hide
my
money
in
,
or
a
place
where
*NL*
it
might
lie
without
lock
or
key
,
till
it
grew
mouldy
and
tarnished
*NL*
before
anybody
would
meddle
with
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
knew
not
where
to
*NL*
put
it
,
or
whom
to
trust
with
it
.
My
old
patron
,
the
captain
,
indeed
,
*NL*
was
honest
,
and
that
was
the
only
refuge
I
had
.
In
the
next
place
,
my
*NL*
interest
in
the
Brazils
seemed
to
summon
me
thither
;
but
now
I
could
not
*NL*
tell
how
to
think
of
going
thither
till
I
had
settled
my
affairs
,
and
*NL*
left
my
effects
in
some
safe
hands
behind
me
.
At
first
I
thought
of
my
*NL*
old
friend
the
widow
,
who
I
knew
was
honest
,
and
would
be
just
to
me
;
but
*NL*
then
she
was
in
years
,
and
but
poor
,
and
,
for
aught
I
knew
,
might
be
in
*NL*
debt
:
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
I
had
no
way
but
to
go
back
to
England
myself
*NL*
and
take
my
effects
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
months
,
however
,
before
I
resolved
upon
this
;
and
,
therefore
,
*NL*
as
I
had
rewarded
the
old
captain
fully
,
and
to
his
satisfaction
,
who
had
*NL*
been
my
former
benefactor
,
so
I
began
to
think
of
the
poor
widow
,
whose
*NL*
husband
had
been
my
first
benefactor
,
and
she
,
while
it
was
in
her
power
,
*NL*
my
faithful
steward
and
instructor
.
So
,
the
first
thing
I
did
,
I
got
a
*NL*
merchant
in
Lisbon
to
write
to
his
correspondent
in
London
,
not
only
to
*NL*
pay
a
bill
,
but
to
go
find
her
out
,
and
carry
her
,
in
money
,
a
hundred
*NL*
pounds
from
me
,
and
to
talk
with
her
,
and
comfort
her
in
her
poverty
,
by
*NL*
telling
her
she
should
,
if
I
lived
,
have
a
further
supply
:
at
the
same
*NL*
time
I
sent
my
two
sisters
in
the
country
a
hundred
pounds
each
,
they
*NL*
being
,
though
not
in
want
,
yet
not
in
very
good
circumstances
;
one
having
*NL*
been
married
and
left
a
widow
;
and
the
other
having
a
husband
not
so
kind
*NL*
to
her
as
he
should
be
.
But
among
all
my
relations
or
acquaintances
I
*NL*
could
not
yet
pitch
upon
one
to
whom
I
durst
commit
the
gross
of
my
*NL*
stock
,
that
I
might
go
away
to
the
Brazils
,
and
leave
things
safe
behind
*NL*
me
;
and
this
greatly
perplexed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
once
a
mind
to
have
gone
to
the
Brazils
and
have
settled
myself
*NL*
there
,
for
I
was
,
as
it
were
,
naturalised
to
the
place
;
but
I
had
some
*NL*
little
scruple
in
my
mind
about
religion
,
which
insensibly
drew
me
back
.
*NL*
However
,
it
was
not
religion
that
kept
me
from
going
there
for
the
*NL*
present
;
and
as
I
had
made
no
scruple
of
being
openly
of
the
religion
of
*NL*
the
country
all
the
while
I
was
among
them
,
so
neither
did
I
yet
;
only
*NL*
that
,
now
and
then
,
having
of
late
thought
more
of
it
than
formerly
,
when
*NL*
I
began
to
think
of
living
and
dying
among
them
,
I
began
to
regret
having
*NL*
professed
myself
a
Papist
,
and
thought
it
might
not
be
the
best
religion
*NL*
to
die
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
I
have
said
,
this
was
not
the
main
thing
that
kept
me
from
going
*NL*
to
the
Brazils
,
but
that
really
I
did
not
know
with
whom
to
leave
my
*NL*
effects
behind
me
;
so
I
resolved
at
last
to
go
to
England
,
where
,
if
I
*NL*
arrived
,
I
concluded
that
I
should
make
some
acquaintance
,
or
find
some
*NL*
relations
,
that
would
be
faithful
to
me
;
and
,
accordingly
,
I
prepared
to
*NL*
go
to
England
with
all
my
wealth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
prepare
things
for
my
going
home
,
I
first
-LRB-
the
Brazil
fleet
*NL*
being
just
going
away
-RRB-
resolved
to
give
answers
suitable
to
the
just
and
*NL*
faithful
account
of
things
I
had
from
thence
;
and
,
first
,
to
the
Prior
of
*NL*
St.
Augustine
I
wrote
a
letter
full
of
thanks
for
his
just
dealings
,
and
*NL*
the
offer
of
the
eight
hundred
and
seventy-two
moidores
which
were
*NL*
undisposed
of
,
which
I
desired
might
be
given
,
five
hundred
to
the
*NL*
monastery
,
and
three
hundred
and
seventy-two
to
the
poor
,
as
the
prior
*NL*
should
direct
;
desiring
the
good
padre
's
prayers
for
me
,
and
the
like
.
I
*NL*
wrote
next
a
letter
of
thanks
to
my
two
trustees
,
with
all
the
*NL*
acknowledgment
that
so
much
justice
and
honesty
called
for
:
as
for
*NL*
sending
them
any
present
,
they
were
far
above
having
any
occasion
of
it
.
*NL*
Lastly
,
I
wrote
to
my
partner
,
acknowledging
his
industry
in
the
*NL*
improving
the
plantation
,
and
his
integrity
in
increasing
the
stock
of
*NL*
the
works
;
giving
him
instructions
for
his
future
government
of
my
part
,
*NL*
according
to
the
powers
I
had
left
with
my
old
patron
,
to
whom
I
desired
*NL*
him
to
send
whatever
became
due
to
me
,
till
he
should
hear
from
me
more
*NL*
particularly
;
assuring
him
that
it
was
my
intention
not
only
to
come
to
*NL*
him
,
but
to
settle
myself
there
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
.
To
this
I
*NL*
added
a
very
handsome
present
of
some
Italian
silks
for
his
wife
and
two
*NL*
daughters
,
for
such
the
captain
's
son
informed
me
he
had
;
with
two
pieces
*NL*
of
fine
English
broadcloth
,
the
best
I
could
get
in
Lisbon
,
five
pieces
*NL*
of
black
baize
,
and
some
Flanders
lace
of
a
good
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
settled
my
affairs
,
sold
my
cargo
,
and
turned
all
my
effects
*NL*
into
good
bills
of
exchange
,
my
next
difficulty
was
which
way
to
go
to
*NL*
England
:
I
had
been
accustomed
enough
to
the
sea
,
and
yet
I
had
a
strange
*NL*
aversion
to
go
to
England
by
the
sea
at
that
time
,
and
yet
I
could
give
*NL*
no
reason
for
it
,
yet
the
difficulty
increased
upon
me
so
much
,
that
*NL*
though
I
had
once
shipped
my
baggage
in
order
to
go
,
yet
I
altered
my
*NL*
mind
,
and
that
not
once
but
two
or
three
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
I
had
been
very
unfortunate
by
sea
,
and
this
might
be
one
of
*NL*
the
reasons
;
but
let
no
man
slight
the
strong
impulses
of
his
own
*NL*
thoughts
in
cases
of
such
moment
:
two
of
the
ships
which
I
had
singled
*NL*
out
to
go
in
,
I
mean
more
particularly
singled
out
than
any
other
,
having
*NL*
put
my
things
on
board
one
of
them
,
and
in
the
other
having
agreed
with
*NL*
the
captain
;
I
say
two
of
these
ships
miscarried
.
One
was
taken
by
the
*NL*
Algerines
,
and
the
other
was
lost
on
the
Start
,
near
Torbay
,
and
all
the
*NL*
people
drowned
except
three
;
so
that
in
either
of
those
vessels
I
had
*NL*
been
made
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
been
thus
harassed
in
my
thoughts
,
my
old
pilot
,
to
whom
I
*NL*
communicated
everything
,
pressed
me
earnestly
not
to
go
by
sea
,
but
*NL*
either
to
go
by
land
to
the
Groyne
,
and
cross
over
the
Bay
of
Biscay
to
*NL*
Rochelle
,
from
whence
it
was
but
an
easy
and
safe
journey
by
land
to
*NL*
Paris
,
and
so
to
Calais
and
Dover
;
or
to
go
up
to
Madrid
,
and
so
all
the
*NL*
way
by
land
through
France
.
In
a
word
,
I
was
so
prepossessed
against
my
*NL*
going
by
sea
at
all
,
except
from
Calais
to
Dover
,
that
I
resolved
to
*NL*
travel
all
the
way
by
land
;
which
,
as
I
was
not
in
haste
,
and
did
not
*NL*
value
the
charge
,
was
by
much
the
pleasanter
way
:
and
to
make
it
more
so
,
*NL*
my
old
captain
brought
an
English
gentleman
,
the
son
of
a
merchant
in
*NL*
Lisbon
,
who
was
willing
to
travel
with
me
;
after
which
we
picked
up
two
*NL*
more
English
merchants
also
,
and
two
young
Portuguese
gentlemen
,
the
last
*NL*
going
to
Paris
only
;
so
that
in
all
there
were
six
of
us
and
five
*NL*
servants
;
the
two
merchants
and
the
two
Portuguese
,
contenting
themselves
*NL*
with
one
servant
between
two
,
to
save
the
charge
;
and
as
for
me
,
I
got
an
*NL*
English
sailor
to
travel
with
me
as
a
servant
,
besides
my
man
Friday
,
who
*NL*
was
too
much
a
stranger
to
be
capable
of
supplying
the
place
of
a
servant
*NL*
on
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
I
set
out
from
Lisbon
;
and
our
company
being
very
well
*NL*
mounted
and
armed
,
we
made
a
little
troop
,
whereof
they
did
me
the
honour
*NL*
to
call
me
captain
,
as
well
because
I
was
the
oldest
man
,
as
because
I
*NL*
had
two
servants
,
and
,
indeed
,
was
the
origin
of
the
whole
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
have
troubled
you
with
none
of
my
sea
journals
,
so
I
shall
trouble
*NL*
you
now
with
none
of
my
land
journals
;
but
some
adventures
that
happened
*NL*
to
us
in
this
tedious
and
difficult
journey
I
must
not
omit
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
Madrid
,
we
,
being
all
of
us
strangers
to
Spain
,
were
*NL*
willing
to
stay
some
time
to
see
the
court
of
Spain
,
and
what
was
worth
*NL*
observing
;
but
it
being
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
,
we
hastened
away
,
*NL*
and
set
out
from
Madrid
about
the
middle
of
October
;
but
when
we
came
to
*NL*
the
edge
of
Navarre
,
we
were
alarmed
,
at
several
towns
on
the
way
,
with
*NL*
an
account
that
so
much
snow
was
falling
on
the
French
side
of
the
*NL*
mountains
,
that
several
travellers
were
obliged
to
come
back
to
*NL*
Pampeluna
,
after
having
attempted
at
an
extreme
hazard
to
pass
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
Pampeluna
itself
,
we
found
it
so
indeed
;
and
to
me
,
that
*NL*
had
been
always
used
to
a
hot
climate
,
and
to
countries
where
I
could
*NL*
scarce
bear
any
clothes
on
,
the
cold
was
insufferable
;
nor
,
indeed
,
was
*NL*
it
more
painful
than
surprising
to
come
but
ten
days
before
out
of
Old
*NL*
Castile
,
where
the
weather
was
not
only
warm
but
very
hot
,
and
*NL*
immediately
to
feel
a
wind
from
the
Pyrenean
Mountains
so
very
keen
,
so
*NL*
severely
cold
,
as
to
be
intolerable
and
to
endanger
benumbing
and
*NL*
perishing
of
our
fingers
and
toes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Friday
was
really
frightened
when
he
saw
the
mountains
all
covered
*NL*
with
snow
,
and
felt
cold
weather
,
which
he
had
never
seen
or
felt
before
*NL*
in
his
life
.
To
mend
the
matter
,
when
we
came
to
Pampeluna
it
continued
*NL*
snowing
with
so
much
violence
and
so
long
,
that
the
people
said
winter
*NL*
was
come
before
its
time
;
and
the
roads
,
which
were
difficult
before
,
*NL*
were
now
quite
impassable
;
for
,
in
a
word
,
the
snow
lay
in
some
places
*NL*
too
thick
for
us
to
travel
,
and
being
not
hard
frozen
,
as
is
the
case
in
*NL*
the
northern
countries
,
there
was
no
going
without
being
in
danger
of
*NL*
being
buried
alive
every
step
.
We
stayed
no
less
than
twenty
days
at
*NL*
Pampeluna
;
when
-LRB-
seeing
the
winter
coming
on
,
and
no
likelihood
of
its
*NL*
being
better
,
for
it
was
the
severest
winter
all
over
Europe
that
had
*NL*
been
known
in
the
memory
of
man
-RRB-
I
proposed
that
we
should
go
away
to
*NL*
Fontarabia
,
and
there
take
shipping
for
Bordeaux
,
which
was
a
very
little
*NL*
voyage
.
But
,
while
I
was
considering
this
,
there
came
in
four
French
*NL*
gentlemen
,
who
,
having
been
stopped
on
the
French
side
of
the
passes
,
as
*NL*
we
were
on
the
Spanish
,
had
found
out
a
guide
,
who
,
traversing
the
*NL*
country
near
the
head
of
Languedoc
,
had
brought
them
over
the
mountains
*NL*
by
such
ways
that
they
were
not
much
incommoded
with
the
snow
;
for
where
*NL*
they
met
with
snow
in
any
quantity
,
they
said
it
was
frozen
hard
enough
*NL*
to
bear
them
and
their
horses
.
We
sent
for
this
guide
,
who
told
us
he
*NL*
would
undertake
to
carry
us
the
same
way
,
with
no
hazard
from
the
snow
,
*NL*
provided
we
were
armed
sufficiently
to
protect
ourselves
from
wild
*NL*
beasts
;
for
,
he
said
,
in
these
great
snows
it
was
frequent
for
some
*NL*
wolves
to
show
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
,
being
made
*NL*
ravenous
for
want
of
food
,
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow
.
We
told
*NL*
him
we
were
well
enough
prepared
for
such
creatures
as
they
were
,
if
he
*NL*
would
insure
us
from
a
kind
of
two-legged
wolves
,
which
we
were
told
we
*NL*
were
in
most
danger
from
,
especially
on
the
French
side
of
the
mountains
.
*NL*
He
satisfied
us
that
there
was
no
danger
of
that
kind
in
the
way
that
we
*NL*
were
to
go
;
so
we
readily
agreed
to
follow
him
,
as
did
also
twelve
other
*NL*
gentlemen
with
their
servants
,
some
French
,
some
Spanish
,
who
,
as
I
said
,
*NL*
had
attempted
to
go
,
and
were
obliged
to
come
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
we
set
out
from
Pampeluna
with
our
guide
on
the
15th
of
*NL*
November
;
and
indeed
I
was
surprised
when
,
instead
of
going
forward
,
he
*NL*
came
directly
back
with
us
on
the
same
road
that
we
came
from
Madrid
,
*NL*
about
twenty
miles
;
when
,
having
passed
two
rivers
,
and
come
into
the
*NL*
plain
country
,
we
found
ourselves
in
a
warm
climate
again
,
where
the
*NL*
country
was
pleasant
,
and
no
snow
to
be
seen
;
but
,
on
a
sudden
,
turning
*NL*
to
his
left
,
he
approached
the
mountains
another
way
;
and
though
it
is
*NL*
true
the
hills
and
precipices
looked
dreadful
,
yet
he
made
so
many
tours
,
*NL*
such
meanders
,
and
led
us
by
such
winding
ways
,
that
we
insensibly
passed
*NL*
the
height
of
the
mountains
without
being
much
encumbered
with
the
snow
;
*NL*
and
all
on
a
sudden
he
showed
us
the
pleasant
and
fruitful
provinces
of
*NL*
Languedoc
and
Gascony
,
all
green
and
flourishing
,
though
at
a
great
*NL*
distance
,
and
we
had
some
rough
way
to
pass
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
a
little
uneasy
,
however
,
when
we
found
it
snowed
one
whole
day
*NL*
and
a
night
so
fast
that
we
could
not
travel
;
but
he
bid
us
be
easy
;
we
*NL*
should
soon
be
past
it
all
:
we
found
,
indeed
,
that
we
began
to
descend
*NL*
every
day
,
and
to
come
more
north
than
before
;
and
so
,
depending
upon
our
*NL*
guide
,
we
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
two
hours
before
night
when
,
our
guide
being
something
*NL*
before
us
,
and
not
just
in
sight
,
out
rushed
three
monstrous
wolves
,
and
*NL*
after
them
a
bear
,
from
a
hollow
way
adjoining
to
a
thick
wood
;
two
of
*NL*
the
wolves
made
at
the
guide
,
and
had
he
been
far
before
us
,
he
would
*NL*
have
been
devoured
before
we
could
have
helped
him
;
one
of
them
fastened
*NL*
upon
his
horse
,
and
the
other
attacked
the
man
with
such
violence
,
that
*NL*
he
had
not
time
,
or
presence
of
mind
enough
,
to
draw
his
pistol
,
but
*NL*
hallooed
and
cried
out
to
us
most
lustily
.
My
man
Friday
being
next
me
,
*NL*
I
bade
him
ride
up
and
see
what
was
the
matter
.
As
soon
as
Friday
came
*NL*
in
sight
of
the
man
,
he
hallooed
out
as
loud
as
the
other
,
``
O
master
!
O
*NL*
master
!
''
but
like
a
bold
fellow
,
rode
directly
up
to
the
poor
man
,
and
*NL*
with
his
pistol
shot
the
wolf
in
the
head
that
attacked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
happy
for
the
poor
man
that
it
was
my
man
Friday
;
for
,
having
been
*NL*
used
to
such
creatures
in
his
country
,
he
had
no
fear
upon
him
,
but
went
*NL*
close
up
to
him
and
shot
him
;
whereas
,
any
other
of
us
would
have
fired
*NL*
at
a
farther
distance
,
and
have
perhaps
either
missed
the
wolf
or
*NL*
endangered
shooting
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
enough
to
have
terrified
a
bolder
man
than
I
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
*NL*
alarmed
all
our
company
,
when
,
with
the
noise
of
Friday
's
pistol
,
we
*NL*
heard
on
both
sides
the
most
dismal
howling
of
wolves
;
and
the
noise
,
*NL*
redoubled
by
the
echo
of
the
mountains
,
appeared
to
us
as
if
there
had
*NL*
been
a
prodigious
number
of
them
;
and
perhaps
there
was
not
such
a
few
as
*NL*
that
we
had
no
cause
of
apprehension
:
however
,
as
Friday
had
killed
this
*NL*
wolf
,
the
other
that
had
fastened
upon
the
horse
left
him
immediately
,
*NL*
and
fled
,
without
doing
him
any
damage
,
having
happily
fastened
upon
his
*NL*
head
,
where
the
bosses
of
the
bridle
had
stuck
in
his
teeth
.
But
the
man
*NL*
was
most
hurt
;
for
the
raging
creature
had
bit
him
twice
,
once
in
the
*NL*
arm
,
and
the
other
time
a
little
above
his
knee
;
and
though
he
had
made
*NL*
some
defence
,
he
was
just
tumbling
down
by
the
disorder
of
his
horse
,
*NL*
when
Friday
came
up
and
shot
the
wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
easy
to
suppose
that
at
the
noise
of
Friday
's
pistol
we
all
mended
*NL*
our
pace
,
and
rode
up
as
fast
as
the
way
,
which
was
very
difficult
,
would
*NL*
give
us
leave
,
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
As
soon
as
we
came
clear
of
*NL*
the
trees
,
which
blinded
us
before
,
we
saw
clearly
what
had
been
the
*NL*
case
,
and
how
Friday
had
disengaged
the
poor
guide
,
though
we
did
not
*NL*
presently
discern
what
kind
of
creature
it
was
he
had
killed
.

CHAPTER
XX
--
FIGHT
BETWEEN
FRIDAY
AND
A
BEAR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
never
was
a
fight
managed
so
hardily
,
and
in
such
a
surprising
manner
*NL*
as
that
which
followed
between
Friday
and
the
bear
,
which
gave
us
all
,
*NL*
though
at
first
we
were
surprised
and
afraid
for
him
,
the
greatest
*NL*
diversion
imaginable
.
As
the
bear
is
a
heavy
,
clumsy
creature
,
and
does
*NL*
not
gallop
as
the
wolf
does
,
who
is
swift
and
light
,
so
he
has
two
*NL*
particular
qualities
,
which
generally
are
the
rule
of
his
actions
;
first
,
*NL*
as
to
men
,
who
are
not
his
proper
prey
-LRB-
he
does
not
usually
attempt
them
,
*NL*
except
they
first
attack
him
,
unless
he
be
excessively
hungry
,
which
it
*NL*
is
probable
might
now
be
the
case
,
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow
-RRB-
,
*NL*
if
you
do
not
meddle
with
him
,
he
will
not
meddle
with
you
;
but
then
you
*NL*
must
take
care
to
be
very
civil
to
him
,
and
give
him
the
road
,
for
he
is
*NL*
a
very
nice
gentleman
;
he
will
not
go
a
step
out
of
his
way
for
a
prince
;
*NL*
nay
,
if
you
are
really
afraid
,
your
best
way
is
to
look
another
way
and
*NL*
keep
going
on
;
for
sometimes
if
you
stop
,
and
stand
still
,
and
look
*NL*
steadfastly
at
him
,
he
takes
it
for
an
affront
;
but
if
you
throw
or
toss
*NL*
anything
at
him
,
though
it
were
but
a
bit
of
stick
as
big
as
your
finger
,
*NL*
he
thinks
himself
abused
,
and
sets
all
other
business
aside
to
pursue
his
*NL*
revenge
,
and
will
have
satisfaction
in
point
of
honour
--
that
is
his
first
*NL*
quality
:
the
next
is
,
if
he
be
once
affronted
,
he
will
never
leave
you
,
*NL*
night
or
day
,
till
he
has
his
revenge
,
but
follows
at
a
good
round
rate
*NL*
till
he
overtakes
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
man
Friday
had
delivered
our
guide
,
and
when
we
came
up
to
him
he
was
*NL*
helping
him
off
his
horse
,
for
the
man
was
both
hurt
and
frightened
,
when
*NL*
on
a
sudden
we
espied
the
bear
come
out
of
the
wood
;
and
a
monstrous
one
*NL*
it
was
,
the
biggest
by
far
that
ever
I
saw
.
We
were
all
a
little
*NL*
surprised
when
we
saw
him
;
but
when
Friday
saw
him
,
it
was
easy
to
see
*NL*
joy
and
courage
in
the
fellow
's
countenance
.
``
O
!
O
!
O
!
''
says
Friday
,
*NL*
three
times
,
pointing
to
him
;
``
O
master
,
you
give
me
te
leave
,
me
shakee
*NL*
te
hand
with
him
;
me
makee
you
good
laugh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
surprised
to
see
the
fellow
so
well
pleased
.
``
You
fool
,
''
says
I
,
*NL*
``
he
will
eat
you
up
.
''
--
``
Eatee
me
up
!
eatee
me
up
!
''
says
Friday
,
twice
*NL*
over
again
;
``
me
eatee
him
up
;
me
makee
you
good
laugh
;
you
all
stay
here
,
*NL*
me
show
you
good
laugh
.
''
So
down
he
sits
,
and
gets
off
his
boots
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
puts
on
a
pair
of
pumps
-LRB-
as
we
call
the
flat
shoes
they
wear
,
*NL*
and
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
-RRB-
,
gives
my
other
servant
his
horse
,
and
*NL*
with
his
gun
away
he
flew
,
swift
like
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bear
was
walking
softly
on
,
and
offered
to
meddle
with
nobody
,
till
*NL*
Friday
coming
pretty
near
,
calls
to
him
,
as
if
the
bear
could
understand
*NL*
him
.
``
Hark
ye
,
hark
ye
,
''
says
Friday
,
``
me
speakee
with
you
.
''
We
*NL*
followed
at
a
distance
,
for
now
being
down
on
the
Gascony
side
of
the
*NL*
mountains
,
we
were
entered
a
vast
forest
,
where
the
country
was
plain
and
*NL*
pretty
open
,
though
it
had
many
trees
in
it
scattered
here
and
there
.
*NL*
Friday
,
who
had
,
as
we
say
,
the
heels
of
the
bear
,
came
up
with
him
*NL*
quickly
,
and
took
up
a
great
stone
,
and
threw
it
at
him
,
and
hit
him
just
*NL*
on
the
head
,
but
did
him
no
more
harm
than
if
he
had
thrown
it
against
a
*NL*
wall
;
but
it
answered
Friday
's
end
,
for
the
rogue
was
so
void
of
fear
*NL*
that
he
did
it
purely
to
make
the
bear
follow
him
,
and
show
us
some
laugh
*NL*
as
he
called
it
.
As
soon
as
the
bear
felt
the
blow
,
and
saw
him
,
he
*NL*
turns
about
and
comes
after
him
,
taking
very
long
strides
,
and
shuffling
*NL*
on
at
a
strange
rate
,
so
as
would
have
put
a
horse
to
a
middling
gallop
;
*NL*
away
reins
Friday
,
and
takes
his
course
as
if
he
ran
towards
us
for
help
;
*NL*
so
we
all
resolved
to
fire
at
once
upon
the
bear
,
and
deliver
my
man
;
*NL*
though
I
was
angry
at
him
for
bringing
the
bear
back
upon
us
,
when
he
was
*NL*
going
about
his
own
business
another
way
;
and
especially
I
was
angry
that
*NL*
he
had
turned
the
bear
upon
us
,
and
then
ran
away
;
and
I
called
out
,
``
You
*NL*
dog
!
is
this
your
making
us
laugh
?
Come
away
,
and
take
your
horse
,
that
*NL*
we
may
shoot
the
creature
.
''
He
heard
me
,
and
cried
out
,
``
No
shoot
,
no
*NL*
shoot
;
stand
still
,
and
you
get
much
laugh
:
''
and
as
the
nimble
creature
*NL*
ran
two
feet
for
the
bear
's
one
,
he
turned
on
a
sudden
on
one
side
of
us
,
*NL*
and
seeing
a
great
oak-tree
fit
for
his
purpose
,
he
beckoned
to
us
to
*NL*
follow
;
and
doubling
his
pace
,
he
got
nimbly
up
the
tree
,
laying
his
gun
*NL*
down
upon
the
ground
,
at
about
five
or
six
yards
from
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
tree
.
The
bear
soon
came
to
the
tree
,
and
we
followed
at
a
distance
:
the
*NL*
first
thing
he
did
he
stopped
at
the
gun
,
smelt
at
it
,
but
let
it
lie
,
*NL*
and
up
he
scrambles
into
the
tree
,
climbing
like
a
cat
,
though
so
*NL*
monstrous
heavy
.
I
was
amazed
at
the
folly
,
as
I
thought
it
,
of
my
man
,
*NL*
and
could
not
for
my
life
see
anything
to
laugh
at
,
till
seeing
the
bear
*NL*
get
up
the
tree
,
we
all
rode
near
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
tree
,
there
was
Friday
got
out
to
the
small
end
of
a
*NL*
large
branch
,
and
the
bear
got
about
half-way
to
him
.
As
soon
as
the
*NL*
bear
got
out
to
that
part
where
the
limb
of
the
tree
was
weaker
,
``
Ha
!
''
*NL*
says
he
to
us
,
``
now
you
see
me
teachee
the
bear
dance
:
''
so
he
began
*NL*
jumping
and
shaking
the
bough
,
at
which
the
bear
began
to
totter
,
but
*NL*
stood
still
,
and
began
to
look
behind
him
,
to
see
how
he
should
get
back
;
*NL*
then
,
indeed
,
we
did
laugh
heartily
.
But
Friday
had
not
done
with
him
by
*NL*
a
great
deal
;
when
seeing
him
stand
still
,
he
called
out
to
him
again
,
as
*NL*
if
he
had
supposed
the
bear
could
speak
English
,
``
What
,
you
come
no
*NL*
farther
?
pray
you
come
farther
;
''
so
he
left
jumping
and
shaking
the
tree
;
*NL*
and
the
bear
,
just
as
if
he
understood
what
he
said
,
did
come
a
little
*NL*
farther
;
then
he
began
jumping
again
,
and
the
bear
stopped
again
.
We
*NL*
thought
now
was
a
good
time
to
knock
him
in
the
head
,
and
called
to
*NL*
Friday
to
stand
still
and
we
should
shoot
the
bear
:
but
he
cried
out
*NL*
earnestly
,
``
Oh
,
pray
!
Oh
,
pray
!
no
shoot
,
me
shoot
by
and
then
:
''
he
*NL*
would
have
said
by-and-by
.
However
,
to
shorten
the
story
,
Friday
danced
*NL*
so
much
,
and
the
bear
stood
so
ticklish
,
that
we
had
laughing
enough
,
but
*NL*
still
could
not
imagine
what
the
fellow
would
do
:
for
first
we
thought
he
*NL*
depended
upon
shaking
the
bear
off
;
and
we
found
the
bear
was
too
cunning
*NL*
for
that
too
;
for
he
would
not
go
out
far
enough
to
be
thrown
down
,
but
*NL*
clung
fast
with
his
great
broad
claws
and
feet
,
so
that
we
could
not
*NL*
imagine
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
,
and
what
the
jest
would
be
at
last
.
*NL*
But
Friday
put
us
out
of
doubt
quickly
:
for
seeing
the
bear
cling
fast
to
*NL*
the
bough
,
and
that
he
would
not
be
persuaded
to
come
any
farther
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
well
,
''
says
Friday
,
``
you
no
come
farther
,
me
go
;
you
no
come
to
me
,
me
*NL*
come
to
you
;
''
and
upon
this
he
went
out
to
the
smaller
end
,
where
it
*NL*
would
bend
with
his
weight
,
and
gently
let
himself
down
by
it
,
sliding
*NL*
down
the
bough
till
he
came
near
enough
to
jump
down
on
his
feet
,
and
*NL*
away
he
ran
to
his
gun
,
took
it
up
,
and
stood
still
.
``
Well
,
''
said
I
to
*NL*
him
,
``
Friday
,
what
will
you
do
now
?
Why
do
n't
you
shoot
him
?
''
``
No
*NL*
shoot
,
''
says
Friday
,
``
no
yet
;
me
shoot
now
,
me
no
kill
;
me
stay
,
give
you
*NL*
one
more
laugh
:
''
and
,
indeed
,
so
he
did
;
for
when
the
bear
saw
his
enemy
*NL*
gone
,
he
came
back
from
the
bough
,
where
he
stood
,
but
did
it
very
*NL*
cautiously
,
looking
behind
him
every
step
,
and
coming
backward
till
he
*NL*
got
into
the
body
of
the
tree
,
then
,
with
the
same
hinder
end
foremost
,
*NL*
he
came
down
the
tree
,
grasping
it
with
his
claws
,
and
moving
one
foot
at
*NL*
a
time
,
very
leisurely
.
At
this
juncture
,
and
just
before
he
could
set
*NL*
his
hind
foot
on
the
ground
,
Friday
stepped
up
close
to
him
,
clapped
the
*NL*
muzzle
of
his
piece
into
his
ear
,
and
shot
him
dead
.
Then
the
rogue
*NL*
turned
about
to
see
if
we
did
not
laugh
;
and
when
he
saw
we
were
pleased
*NL*
by
our
looks
,
he
began
to
laugh
very
loud
.
``
So
we
kill
bear
in
my
*NL*
country
,
''
says
Friday
.
``
So
you
kill
them
?
''
says
I
;
``
why
,
you
have
no
*NL*
guns
.
''
--
``
No
,
''
says
he
,
``
no
gun
,
but
shoot
great
much
long
arrow
.
''
This
*NL*
was
a
good
diversion
to
us
;
but
we
were
still
in
a
wild
place
,
and
our
*NL*
guide
very
much
hurt
,
and
what
to
do
we
hardly
knew
;
the
howling
of
*NL*
wolves
ran
much
in
my
head
;
and
,
indeed
,
except
the
noise
I
once
heard
on
*NL*
the
shore
of
Africa
,
of
which
I
have
said
something
already
,
I
never
*NL*
heard
anything
that
filled
me
with
so
much
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
things
,
and
the
approach
of
night
,
called
us
off
,
or
else
,
as
*NL*
Friday
would
have
had
us
,
we
should
certainly
have
taken
the
skin
of
this
*NL*
monstrous
creature
off
,
which
was
worth
saving
;
but
we
had
near
three
*NL*
leagues
to
go
,
and
our
guide
hastened
us
;
so
we
left
him
,
and
went
*NL*
forward
on
our
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ground
was
still
covered
with
snow
,
though
not
so
deep
and
dangerous
*NL*
as
on
the
mountains
;
and
the
ravenous
creatures
,
as
we
heard
afterwards
,
*NL*
were
come
down
into
the
forest
and
plain
country
,
pressed
by
hunger
,
to
*NL*
seek
for
food
,
and
had
done
a
great
deal
of
mischief
in
the
villages
,
*NL*
where
they
surprised
the
country
people
,
killed
a
great
many
of
their
*NL*
sheep
and
horses
,
and
some
people
too
.
We
had
one
dangerous
place
to
*NL*
pass
,
and
our
guide
told
us
if
there
were
more
wolves
in
the
country
we
*NL*
should
find
them
there
;
and
this
was
a
small
plain
,
surrounded
with
woods
*NL*
on
every
side
,
and
a
long
,
narrow
defile
,
or
lane
,
which
we
were
to
pass
*NL*
to
get
through
the
wood
,
and
then
we
should
come
to
the
village
where
we
*NL*
were
to
lodge
.
It
was
within
half-an-hour
of
sunset
when
we
entered
the
*NL*
wood
,
and
a
little
after
sunset
when
we
came
into
the
plain
:
we
met
with
*NL*
nothing
in
the
first
wood
,
except
that
in
a
little
plain
within
the
wood
,
*NL*
which
was
not
above
two
furlongs
over
,
we
saw
five
great
wolves
cross
the
*NL*
road
,
full
speed
,
one
after
another
,
as
if
they
had
been
in
chase
of
some
*NL*
prey
,
and
had
it
in
view
;
they
took
no
notice
of
us
,
and
were
gone
out
of
*NL*
sight
in
a
few
moments
.
Upon
this
,
our
guide
,
who
,
by
the
way
,
was
but
a
*NL*
fainthearted
fellow
,
bid
us
keep
in
a
ready
posture
,
for
he
believed
*NL*
there
were
more
wolves
a-coming
.
We
kept
our
arms
ready
,
and
our
eyes
*NL*
about
us
;
but
we
saw
no
more
wolves
till
we
came
through
that
wood
,
which
*NL*
was
near
half
a
league
,
and
entered
the
plain
.
As
soon
as
we
came
into
*NL*
the
plain
,
we
had
occasion
enough
to
look
about
us
.
The
first
object
we
*NL*
met
with
was
a
dead
horse
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
poor
horse
which
the
wolves
*NL*
had
killed
,
and
at
least
a
dozen
of
them
at
work
,
we
could
not
say
eating
*NL*
him
,
but
picking
his
bones
rather
;
for
they
had
eaten
up
all
the
flesh
*NL*
before
.
We
did
not
think
fit
to
disturb
them
at
their
feast
,
neither
did
*NL*
they
take
much
notice
of
us
.
Friday
would
have
let
fly
at
them
,
but
I
*NL*
would
not
suffer
him
by
any
means
;
for
I
found
we
were
like
to
have
more
*NL*
business
upon
our
hands
than
we
were
aware
of
.
We
had
not
gone
half
over
*NL*
the
plain
when
we
began
to
hear
the
wolves
howl
in
the
wood
on
our
left
*NL*
in
a
frightful
manner
,
and
presently
after
we
saw
about
a
hundred
coming
*NL*
on
directly
towards
us
,
all
in
a
body
,
and
most
of
them
in
a
line
,
as
*NL*
regularly
as
an
army
drawn
up
by
experienced
officers
.
I
scarce
knew
in
*NL*
what
manner
to
receive
them
,
but
found
to
draw
ourselves
in
a
close
line
*NL*
was
the
only
way
;
so
we
formed
in
a
moment
;
but
that
we
might
not
have
*NL*
too
much
interval
,
I
ordered
that
only
every
other
man
should
fire
,
and
*NL*
that
the
others
,
who
had
not
fired
,
should
stand
ready
to
give
them
a
*NL*
second
volley
immediately
,
if
they
continued
to
advance
upon
us
;
and
then
*NL*
that
those
that
had
fired
at
first
should
not
pretend
to
load
their
*NL*
fusees
again
,
but
stand
ready
,
every
one
with
a
pistol
,
for
we
were
all
*NL*
armed
with
a
fusee
and
a
pair
of
pistols
each
man
;
so
we
were
,
by
this
*NL*
method
,
able
to
fire
six
volleys
,
half
of
us
at
a
time
;
however
,
at
*NL*
present
we
had
no
necessity
;
for
upon
firing
the
first
volley
,
the
enemy
*NL*
made
a
full
stop
,
being
terrified
as
well
with
the
noise
as
with
the
*NL*
fire
.
Four
of
them
being
shot
in
the
head
,
dropped
;
several
others
were
*NL*
wounded
,
and
went
bleeding
off
,
as
we
could
see
by
the
snow
.
I
found
*NL*
they
stopped
,
but
did
not
immediately
retreat
;
whereupon
,
remembering
*NL*
that
I
had
been
told
that
the
fiercest
creatures
were
terrified
at
the
*NL*
voice
of
a
man
,
I
caused
all
the
company
to
halloo
as
loud
as
they
could
;
*NL*
and
I
found
the
notion
not
altogether
mistaken
;
for
upon
our
shout
they
*NL*
began
to
retire
and
turn
about
.
I
then
ordered
a
second
volley
to
be
*NL*
fired
in
their
rear
,
which
put
them
to
the
gallop
,
and
away
they
went
to
*NL*
the
woods
.
This
gave
us
leisure
to
charge
our
pieces
again
;
and
that
we
*NL*
might
lose
no
time
,
we
kept
going
;
but
we
had
but
little
more
than
loaded
*NL*
our
fusees
,
and
put
ourselves
in
readiness
,
when
we
heard
a
terrible
*NL*
noise
in
the
same
wood
on
our
left
,
only
that
it
was
farther
onward
,
the
*NL*
same
way
we
were
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
coming
on
,
and
the
light
began
to
be
dusky
,
which
made
it
*NL*
worse
on
our
side
;
but
the
noise
increasing
,
we
could
easily
perceive
*NL*
that
it
was
the
howling
and
yelling
of
those
hellish
creatures
;
and
on
a
*NL*
sudden
we
perceived
three
troops
of
wolves
,
one
on
our
left
,
one
behind
*NL*
us
,
and
one
in
our
front
,
so
that
we
seemed
to
be
surrounded
with
them
:
*NL*
however
,
as
they
did
not
fall
upon
us
,
we
kept
our
way
forward
,
as
fast
*NL*
as
we
could
make
our
horses
go
,
which
,
the
way
being
very
rough
,
was
only
*NL*
a
good
hard
trot
.
In
this
manner
,
we
came
in
view
of
the
entrance
of
a
*NL*
wood
,
through
which
we
were
to
pass
,
at
the
farther
side
of
the
plain
;
*NL*
but
we
were
greatly
surprised
,
when
coming
nearer
the
lane
or
pass
,
we
*NL*
saw
a
confused
number
of
wolves
standing
just
at
the
entrance
.
On
a
*NL*
sudden
,
at
another
opening
of
the
wood
,
we
heard
the
noise
of
a
gun
,
and
*NL*
looking
that
way
,
out
rushed
a
horse
,
with
a
saddle
and
a
bridle
on
him
,
*NL*
flying
like
the
wind
,
and
sixteen
or
seventeen
wolves
after
him
,
full
*NL*
speed
:
the
horse
had
the
advantage
of
them
;
but
as
we
supposed
that
he
*NL*
could
not
hold
it
at
that
rate
,
we
doubted
not
but
they
would
get
up
with
*NL*
him
at
last
:
no
question
but
they
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
we
had
a
most
horrible
sight
;
for
riding
up
to
the
entrance
*NL*
where
the
horse
came
out
,
we
found
the
carcasses
of
another
horse
and
of
*NL*
two
men
,
devoured
by
the
ravenous
creatures
;
and
one
of
the
men
was
no
*NL*
doubt
the
same
whom
we
heard
fire
the
gun
,
for
there
lay
a
gun
just
by
*NL*
him
fired
off
;
but
as
to
the
man
,
his
head
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
*NL*
was
eaten
up
.
This
filled
us
with
horror
,
and
we
knew
not
what
course
to
*NL*
take
;
but
the
creatures
resolved
us
soon
,
for
they
gathered
about
us
*NL*
presently
,
in
hopes
of
prey
;
and
I
verily
believe
there
were
three
*NL*
hundred
of
them
.
It
happened
,
very
much
to
our
advantage
,
that
at
the
*NL*
entrance
into
the
wood
,
but
a
little
way
from
it
,
there
lay
some
large
*NL*
timber-trees
,
which
had
been
cut
down
the
summer
before
,
and
I
suppose
*NL*
lay
there
for
carriage
.
I
drew
my
little
troop
in
among
those
trees
,
and
*NL*
placing
ourselves
in
a
line
behind
one
long
tree
,
I
advised
them
all
to
*NL*
alight
,
and
keeping
that
tree
before
us
for
a
breastwork
,
to
stand
in
a
*NL*
triangle
,
or
three
fronts
,
enclosing
our
horses
in
the
centre
.
We
did
*NL*
so
,
and
it
was
well
we
did
;
for
never
was
a
more
furious
charge
than
the
*NL*
creatures
made
upon
us
in
this
place
.
They
came
on
with
a
growling
kind
*NL*
of
noise
,
and
mounted
the
piece
of
timber
,
which
,
as
I
said
,
was
our
*NL*
breastwork
,
as
if
they
were
only
rushing
upon
their
prey
;
and
this
fury
*NL*
of
theirs
,
it
seems
,
was
principally
occasioned
by
their
seeing
our
*NL*
horses
behind
us
.
I
ordered
our
men
to
fire
as
before
,
every
other
man
;
*NL*
and
they
took
their
aim
so
sure
that
they
killed
several
of
the
wolves
at
*NL*
the
first
volley
;
but
there
was
a
necessity
to
keep
a
continual
firing
,
*NL*
for
they
came
on
like
devils
,
those
behind
pushing
on
those
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
fired
a
second
volley
of
our
fusees
,
we
thought
they
stopped
*NL*
a
little
,
and
I
hoped
they
would
have
gone
off
,
but
it
was
but
a
moment
,
*NL*
for
others
came
forward
again
;
so
we
fired
two
volleys
of
our
pistols
;
*NL*
and
I
believe
in
these
four
firings
we
had
killed
seventeen
or
eighteen
*NL*
of
them
,
and
lamed
twice
as
many
,
yet
they
came
on
again
.
I
was
loth
to
*NL*
spend
our
shot
too
hastily
;
so
I
called
my
servant
,
not
my
man
Friday
,
*NL*
for
he
was
better
employed
,
for
,
with
the
greatest
dexterity
imaginable
,
*NL*
he
had
charged
my
fusee
and
his
own
while
we
were
engaged
--
but
,
as
I
*NL*
said
,
I
called
my
other
man
,
and
giving
him
a
horn
of
powder
,
I
had
him
*NL*
lay
a
train
all
along
the
piece
of
timber
,
and
let
it
be
a
large
train
.
*NL*
He
did
so
,
and
had
but
just
time
to
get
away
,
when
the
wolves
came
up
to
*NL*
it
,
and
some
got
upon
it
,
when
I
,
snapping
an
unchanged
pistol
close
to
*NL*
the
powder
,
set
it
on
fire
;
those
that
were
upon
the
timber
were
scorched
*NL*
with
it
,
and
six
or
seven
of
them
fell
;
or
rather
jumped
in
among
us
with
*NL*
the
force
and
fright
of
the
fire
;
we
despatched
these
in
an
instant
,
and
*NL*
the
rest
were
so
frightened
with
the
light
,
which
the
night
--
for
it
was
*NL*
now
very
near
dark
--
made
more
terrible
that
they
drew
back
a
little
;
upon
*NL*
which
I
ordered
our
last
pistols
to
be
fired
off
in
one
volley
,
and
after
*NL*
that
we
gave
a
shout
;
upon
this
the
wolves
turned
tail
,
and
we
sallied
*NL*
immediately
upon
near
twenty
lame
ones
that
we
found
struggling
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
fell
to
cutting
them
with
our
swords
,
which
answered
our
*NL*
expectation
,
for
the
crying
and
howling
they
made
was
better
understood
*NL*
by
their
fellows
;
so
that
they
all
fled
and
left
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
,
first
and
last
,
killed
about
threescore
of
them
,
and
had
it
been
*NL*
daylight
we
had
killed
many
more
.
The
field
of
battle
being
thus
*NL*
cleared
,
we
made
forward
again
,
for
we
had
still
near
a
league
to
go
.
We
*NL*
heard
the
ravenous
creatures
howl
and
yell
in
the
woods
as
we
went
*NL*
several
times
,
and
sometimes
we
fancied
we
saw
some
of
them
;
but
the
snow
*NL*
dazzling
our
eyes
,
we
were
not
certain
.
In
about
an
hour
more
we
came
to
*NL*
the
town
where
we
were
to
lodge
,
which
we
found
in
a
terrible
fright
and
*NL*
all
in
arms
;
for
,
it
seems
,
the
night
before
the
wolves
and
some
bears
*NL*
had
broken
into
the
village
,
and
put
them
in
such
terror
that
they
were
*NL*
obliged
to
keep
guard
night
and
day
,
but
especially
in
the
night
,
to
*NL*
preserve
their
cattle
,
and
indeed
their
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
our
guide
was
so
ill
,
and
his
limbs
swelled
so
much
with
*NL*
the
rankling
of
his
two
wounds
,
that
he
could
go
no
farther
;
so
we
were
*NL*
obliged
to
take
a
new
guide
here
,
and
go
to
Toulouse
,
where
we
found
a
*NL*
warm
climate
,
a
fruitful
,
pleasant
country
,
and
no
snow
,
no
wolves
,
nor
*NL*
anything
like
them
;
but
when
we
told
our
story
at
Toulouse
,
they
told
us
*NL*
it
was
nothing
but
what
was
ordinary
in
the
great
forest
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
mountains
,
especially
when
the
snow
lay
on
the
ground
;
but
they
*NL*
inquired
much
what
kind
of
guide
we
had
got
who
would
venture
to
bring
us
*NL*
that
way
in
such
a
severe
season
,
and
told
us
it
was
surprising
we
were
*NL*
not
all
devoured
.
When
we
told
them
how
we
placed
ourselves
and
the
*NL*
horses
in
the
middle
,
they
blamed
us
exceedingly
,
and
told
us
it
was
*NL*
fifty
to
one
but
we
had
been
all
destroyed
,
for
it
was
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
horses
which
made
the
wolves
so
furious
,
seeing
their
prey
,
and
that
at
*NL*
other
times
they
are
really
afraid
of
a
gun
;
but
being
excessively
*NL*
hungry
,
and
raging
on
that
account
,
the
eagerness
to
come
at
the
horses
*NL*
had
made
them
senseless
of
danger
,
and
that
if
we
had
not
by
the
*NL*
continual
fire
,
and
at
last
by
the
stratagem
of
the
train
of
powder
,
*NL*
mastered
them
,
it
had
been
great
odds
but
that
we
had
been
torn
to
*NL*
pieces
;
whereas
,
had
we
been
content
to
have
sat
still
on
horseback
,
and
*NL*
fired
as
horsemen
,
they
would
not
have
taken
the
horses
so
much
for
their
*NL*
own
,
when
men
were
on
their
backs
,
as
otherwise
;
and
withal
,
they
told
us
*NL*
that
at
last
,
if
we
had
stood
altogether
,
and
left
our
horses
,
they
would
*NL*
have
been
so
eager
to
have
devoured
them
,
that
we
might
have
come
off
*NL*
safe
,
especially
having
our
firearms
in
our
hands
,
being
so
many
in
*NL*
number
.
For
my
part
,
I
was
never
so
sensible
of
danger
in
my
life
;
for
,
*NL*
seeing
above
three
hundred
devils
come
roaring
and
open-mouthed
to
devour
*NL*
us
,
and
having
nothing
to
shelter
us
or
retreat
to
,
I
gave
myself
over
*NL*
for
lost
;
and
,
as
it
was
,
I
believe
I
shall
never
care
to
cross
those
*NL*
mountains
again
:
I
think
I
would
much
rather
go
a
thousand
leagues
by
*NL*
sea
,
though
I
was
sure
to
meet
with
a
storm
once
a-week
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
nothing
uncommon
to
take
notice
of
in
my
passage
through
*NL*
France
--
nothing
but
what
other
travellers
have
given
an
account
of
with
*NL*
much
more
advantage
than
I
can
.
I
travelled
from
Toulouse
to
Paris
,
and
*NL*
without
any
considerable
stay
came
to
Calais
,
and
landed
safe
at
Dover
*NL*
the
14th
of
January
,
after
having
had
a
severe
cold
season
to
travel
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
come
to
the
centre
of
my
travels
,
and
had
in
a
little
time
all
*NL*
my
new-discovered
estate
safe
about
me
,
the
bills
of
exchange
which
I
*NL*
brought
with
me
having
been
currently
paid
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
principal
guide
and
privy-counsellor
was
my
good
ancient
widow
,
who
,
*NL*
in
gratitude
for
the
money
I
had
sent
her
,
thought
no
pains
too
much
nor
*NL*
care
too
great
to
employ
for
me
;
and
I
trusted
her
so
entirely
that
I
was
*NL*
perfectly
easy
as
to
the
security
of
my
effects
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
was
very
*NL*
happy
from
the
beginning
,
and
now
to
the
end
,
in
the
unspotted
integrity
*NL*
of
this
good
gentlewoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
having
resolved
to
dispose
of
my
plantation
in
the
Brazils
,
I
*NL*
wrote
to
my
old
friend
at
Lisbon
,
who
,
having
offered
it
to
the
two
*NL*
merchants
,
the
survivors
of
my
trustees
,
who
lived
in
the
Brazils
,
they
*NL*
accepted
the
offer
,
and
remitted
thirty-three
thousand
pieces
of
eight
to
*NL*
a
correspondent
of
theirs
at
Lisbon
to
pay
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
return
,
I
signed
the
instrument
of
sale
in
the
form
which
they
sent
*NL*
from
Lisbon
,
and
sent
it
to
my
old
man
,
who
sent
me
the
bills
of
exchange
*NL*
for
thirty-two
thousand
eight
hundred
pieces
of
eight
for
the
estate
,
*NL*
reserving
the
payment
of
one
hundred
moidores
a
year
to
him
-LRB-
the
old
man
-RRB-
*NL*
during
his
life
,
and
fifty
moidores
afterwards
to
his
son
for
his
life
,
*NL*
which
I
had
promised
them
,
and
which
the
plantation
was
to
make
good
as
a
*NL*
rent-charge
.
And
thus
I
have
given
the
first
part
of
a
life
of
fortune
*NL*
and
adventure
--
a
life
of
Providence
's
chequer-work
,
and
of
a
variety
*NL*
which
the
world
will
seldom
be
able
to
show
the
like
of
;
beginning
*NL*
foolishly
,
but
closing
much
more
happily
than
any
part
of
it
ever
gave
me
*NL*
leave
so
much
as
to
hope
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
would
think
that
in
this
state
of
complicated
good
fortune
I
was
*NL*
past
running
any
more
hazards
--
and
so
,
indeed
,
I
had
been
,
if
other
*NL*
circumstances
had
concurred
;
but
I
was
inured
to
a
wandering
life
,
had
no
*NL*
family
,
nor
many
relations
;
nor
,
however
rich
,
had
I
contracted
fresh
*NL*
acquaintance
;
and
though
I
had
sold
my
estate
in
the
Brazils
,
yet
I
could
*NL*
not
keep
that
country
out
of
my
head
,
and
had
a
great
mind
to
be
upon
the
*NL*
wing
again
;
especially
I
could
not
resist
the
strong
inclination
I
had
to
*NL*
see
my
island
,
and
to
know
if
the
poor
Spaniards
were
in
being
there
.
My
*NL*
true
friend
,
the
widow
,
earnestly
dissuaded
me
from
it
,
and
so
far
*NL*
prevailed
with
me
,
that
for
almost
seven
years
she
prevented
my
running
*NL*
abroad
,
during
which
time
I
took
my
two
nephews
,
the
children
of
one
of
*NL*
my
brothers
,
into
my
care
;
the
eldest
,
having
something
of
his
own
,
I
*NL*
bred
up
as
a
gentleman
,
and
gave
him
a
settlement
of
some
addition
to
his
*NL*
estate
after
my
decease
.
The
other
I
placed
with
the
captain
of
a
ship
;
*NL*
and
after
five
years
,
finding
him
a
sensible
,
bold
,
enterprising
young
*NL*
fellow
,
I
put
him
into
a
good
ship
,
and
sent
him
to
sea
;
and
this
young
*NL*
fellow
afterwards
drew
me
in
,
as
old
as
I
was
,
to
further
adventures
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
I
in
part
settled
myself
here
;
for
,
first
of
all
,
I
*NL*
married
,
and
that
not
either
to
my
disadvantage
or
dissatisfaction
,
and
*NL*
had
three
children
,
two
sons
and
one
daughter
;
but
my
wife
dying
,
and
my
*NL*
nephew
coming
home
with
good
success
from
a
voyage
to
Spain
,
my
*NL*
inclination
to
go
abroad
,
and
his
importunity
,
prevailed
,
and
engaged
me
*NL*
to
go
in
his
ship
as
a
private
trader
to
the
East
Indies
;
this
was
in
the
*NL*
year
1694
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
voyage
I
visited
my
new
colony
in
the
island
,
saw
my
successors
*NL*
the
Spaniards
,
had
the
old
story
of
their
lives
and
of
the
villains
I
*NL*
left
there
;
how
at
first
they
insulted
the
poor
Spaniards
,
how
they
*NL*
afterwards
agreed
,
disagreed
,
united
,
separated
,
and
how
at
last
the
*NL*
Spaniards
were
obliged
to
use
violence
with
them
;
how
they
were
subjected
*NL*
to
the
Spaniards
,
how
honestly
the
Spaniards
used
them
--
a
history
,
if
it
*NL*
were
entered
into
,
as
full
of
variety
and
wonderful
accidents
as
my
own
*NL*
part
--
particularly
,
also
,
as
to
their
battles
with
the
Caribbeans
,
who
*NL*
landed
several
times
upon
the
island
,
and
as
to
the
improvement
they
made
*NL*
upon
the
island
itself
,
and
how
five
of
them
made
an
attempt
upon
the
*NL*
mainland
,
and
brought
away
eleven
men
and
five
women
prisoners
,
by
which
,
*NL*
at
my
coming
,
I
found
about
twenty
young
children
on
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
stayed
about
twenty
days
,
left
them
supplies
of
all
necessary
*NL*
things
,
and
particularly
of
arms
,
powder
,
shot
,
clothes
,
tools
,
and
two
*NL*
workmen
,
which
I
had
brought
from
England
with
me
,
viz
.
a
carpenter
and
a
*NL*
smith
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
I
shared
the
lands
into
parts
with
them
,
reserved
to
myself
*NL*
the
property
of
the
whole
,
but
gave
them
such
parts
respectively
as
they
*NL*
agreed
on
;
and
having
settled
all
things
with
them
,
and
engaged
them
not
*NL*
to
leave
the
place
,
I
left
them
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
thence
I
touched
at
the
Brazils
,
from
whence
I
sent
a
bark
,
which
I
*NL*
bought
there
,
with
more
people
to
the
island
;
and
in
it
,
besides
other
*NL*
supplies
,
I
sent
seven
women
,
being
such
as
I
found
proper
for
service
,
*NL*
or
for
wives
to
such
as
would
take
them
.
As
to
the
Englishmen
,
I
*NL*
promised
to
send
them
some
women
from
England
,
with
a
good
cargo
of
*NL*
necessaries
,
if
they
would
apply
themselves
to
planting
--
which
I
*NL*
afterwards
could
not
perform
.
The
fellows
proved
very
honest
and
*NL*
diligent
after
they
were
mastered
and
had
their
properties
set
apart
for
*NL*
them
.
I
sent
them
,
also
,
from
the
Brazils
,
five
cows
,
three
of
them
*NL*
being
big
with
calf
,
some
sheep
,
and
some
hogs
,
which
when
I
came
again
*NL*
were
considerably
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
these
things
,
with
an
account
how
three
hundred
Caribbees
came
*NL*
and
invaded
them
,
and
ruined
their
plantations
,
and
how
they
fought
with
*NL*
that
whole
number
twice
,
and
were
at
first
defeated
,
and
one
of
them
*NL*
killed
;
but
at
last
,
a
storm
destroying
their
enemies
'
canoes
,
they
*NL*
famished
or
destroyed
almost
all
the
rest
,
and
renewed
and
recovered
the
*NL*
possession
of
their
plantation
,
and
still
lived
upon
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
things
,
with
some
very
surprising
incidents
in
some
new
*NL*
adventures
of
my
own
,
for
ten
years
more
,
I
shall
give
a
farther
account
*NL*
of
in
the
Second
Part
of
my
Story
.
