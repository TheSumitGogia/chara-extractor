PART
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
little
town
of
Vevey
,
in
Switzerland
,
there
is
a
particularly
*NL*
comfortable
hotel
.
There
are
,
indeed
,
many
hotels
,
for
the
entertainment
*NL*
of
tourists
is
the
business
of
the
place
,
which
,
as
many
travelers
will
*NL*
remember
,
is
seated
upon
the
edge
of
a
remarkably
blue
lake
--
a
lake
that
*NL*
it
behooves
every
tourist
to
visit
.
The
shore
of
the
lake
presents
an
*NL*
unbroken
array
of
establishments
of
this
order
,
of
every
category
,
from
*NL*
the
``
grand
hotel
''
of
the
newest
fashion
,
with
a
chalk-white
front
,
a
*NL*
hundred
balconies
,
and
a
dozen
flags
flying
from
its
roof
,
to
the
little
*NL*
Swiss
pension
of
an
elder
day
,
with
its
name
inscribed
in
German-looking
*NL*
lettering
upon
a
pink
or
yellow
wall
and
an
awkward
summerhouse
in
the
*NL*
angle
of
the
garden
.
One
of
the
hotels
at
Vevey
,
however
,
is
famous
,
*NL*
even
classical
,
being
distinguished
from
many
of
its
upstart
neighbors
*NL*
by
an
air
both
of
luxury
and
of
maturity
.
In
this
region
,
in
the
month
*NL*
of
June
,
American
travelers
are
extremely
numerous
;
it
may
be
said
,
*NL*
indeed
,
that
Vevey
assumes
at
this
period
some
of
the
characteristics
*NL*
of
an
American
watering
place
.
There
are
sights
and
sounds
which
evoke
a
*NL*
vision
,
an
echo
,
of
Newport
and
Saratoga
.
There
is
a
flitting
hither
*NL*
and
thither
of
``
stylish
''
young
girls
,
a
rustling
of
muslin
flounces
,
*NL*
a
rattle
of
dance
music
in
the
morning
hours
,
a
sound
of
high-pitched
*NL*
voices
at
all
times
.
You
receive
an
impression
of
these
things
at
the
*NL*
excellent
inn
of
the
``
Trois
Couronnes
''
and
are
transported
in
fancy
to
*NL*
the
Ocean
House
or
to
Congress
Hall
.
But
at
the
``
Trois
Couronnes
,
''
it
*NL*
must
be
added
,
there
are
other
features
that
are
much
at
variance
with
*NL*
these
suggestions
:
neat
German
waiters
,
who
look
like
secretaries
of
*NL*
legation
;
Russian
princesses
sitting
in
the
garden
;
little
Polish
boys
*NL*
walking
about
held
by
the
hand
,
with
their
governors
;
a
view
of
the
*NL*
sunny
crest
of
the
Dent
du
Midi
and
the
picturesque
towers
of
the
Castle
*NL*
of
Chillon
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hardly
know
whether
it
was
the
analogies
or
the
differences
that
were
*NL*
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
a
young
American
,
who
,
two
or
three
years
ago
,
*NL*
sat
in
the
garden
of
the
``
Trois
Couronnes
,
''
looking
about
him
,
rather
*NL*
idly
,
at
some
of
the
graceful
objects
I
have
mentioned
.
It
was
a
*NL*
beautiful
summer
morning
,
and
in
whatever
fashion
the
young
American
*NL*
looked
at
things
,
they
must
have
seemed
to
him
charming
.
He
had
come
*NL*
from
Geneva
the
day
before
by
the
little
steamer
,
to
see
his
aunt
,
who
*NL*
was
staying
at
the
hotel
--
Geneva
having
been
for
a
long
time
his
place
*NL*
of
residence
.
But
his
aunt
had
a
headache
--
his
aunt
had
almost
always
a
*NL*
headache
--
and
now
she
was
shut
up
in
her
room
,
smelling
camphor
,
so
that
*NL*
he
was
at
liberty
to
wander
about
.
He
was
some
seven-and-twenty
years
*NL*
of
age
;
when
his
friends
spoke
of
him
,
they
usually
said
that
he
was
at
*NL*
Geneva
``
studying
.
''
When
his
enemies
spoke
of
him
,
they
said
--
but
,
*NL*
after
all
,
he
had
no
enemies
;
he
was
an
extremely
amiable
fellow
,
and
*NL*
universally
liked
.
What
I
should
say
is
,
simply
,
that
when
certain
*NL*
persons
spoke
of
him
they
affirmed
that
the
reason
of
his
spending
so
*NL*
much
time
at
Geneva
was
that
he
was
extremely
devoted
to
a
lady
who
*NL*
lived
there
--
a
foreign
lady
--
a
person
older
than
himself
.
Very
few
*NL*
Americans
--
indeed
,
I
think
none
--
had
ever
seen
this
lady
,
about
whom
*NL*
there
were
some
singular
stories
.
But
Winterbourne
had
an
old
attachment
*NL*
for
the
little
metropolis
of
Calvinism
;
he
had
been
put
to
school
there
*NL*
as
a
boy
,
and
he
had
afterward
gone
to
college
there
--
circumstances
*NL*
which
had
led
to
his
forming
a
great
many
youthful
friendships
.
Many
of
*NL*
these
he
had
kept
,
and
they
were
a
source
of
great
satisfaction
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
knocking
at
his
aunt
's
door
and
learning
that
she
was
indisposed
,
*NL*
he
had
taken
a
walk
about
the
town
,
and
then
he
had
come
in
to
his
*NL*
breakfast
.
He
had
now
finished
his
breakfast
;
but
he
was
drinking
a
*NL*
small
cup
of
coffee
,
which
had
been
served
to
him
on
a
little
table
in
*NL*
the
garden
by
one
of
the
waiters
who
looked
like
an
attache
.
At
last
*NL*
he
finished
his
coffee
and
lit
a
cigarette
.
Presently
a
small
boy
came
*NL*
walking
along
the
path
--
an
urchin
of
nine
or
ten
.
The
child
,
who
was
*NL*
diminutive
for
his
years
,
had
an
aged
expression
of
countenance
,
a
pale
*NL*
complexion
,
and
sharp
little
features
.
He
was
dressed
in
knickerbockers
,
*NL*
with
red
stockings
,
which
displayed
his
poor
little
spindle-shanks
;
*NL*
he
also
wore
a
brilliant
red
cravat
.
He
carried
in
his
hand
a
long
*NL*
alpenstock
,
the
sharp
point
of
which
he
thrust
into
everything
that
*NL*
he
approached
--
the
flowerbeds
,
the
garden
benches
,
the
trains
of
the
*NL*
ladies
'
dresses
.
In
front
of
Winterbourne
he
paused
,
looking
at
him
with
*NL*
a
pair
of
bright
,
penetrating
little
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
give
me
a
lump
of
sugar
?
''
he
asked
in
a
sharp
,
hard
little
*NL*
voice
--
a
voice
immature
and
yet
,
somehow
,
not
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
glanced
at
the
small
table
near
him
,
on
which
his
coffee
*NL*
service
rested
,
and
saw
that
several
morsels
of
sugar
remained
.
``
Yes
,
*NL*
you
may
take
one
,
''
he
answered
;
``
but
I
do
n't
think
sugar
is
good
for
*NL*
little
boys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
boy
stepped
forward
and
carefully
selected
three
of
*NL*
the
coveted
fragments
,
two
of
which
he
buried
in
the
pocket
of
his
*NL*
knickerbockers
,
depositing
the
other
as
promptly
in
another
place
.
He
*NL*
poked
his
alpenstock
,
lance-fashion
,
into
Winterbourne
's
bench
and
tried
*NL*
to
crack
the
lump
of
sugar
with
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
blazes
;
it
's
har-r-d
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
pronouncing
the
adjective
in
a
*NL*
peculiar
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
had
immediately
perceived
that
he
might
have
the
honor
*NL*
of
claiming
him
as
a
fellow
countryman
.
``
Take
care
you
do
n't
hurt
your
*NL*
teeth
,
''
he
said
,
paternally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
got
any
teeth
to
hurt
.
They
have
all
come
out
.
I
have
only
*NL*
got
seven
teeth
.
My
mother
counted
them
last
night
,
and
one
came
out
*NL*
right
afterward
.
She
said
she
'd
slap
me
if
any
more
came
out
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
it
.
It
's
this
old
Europe
.
It
's
the
climate
that
makes
them
come
*NL*
out
.
In
America
they
did
n't
come
out
.
It
's
these
hotels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
was
much
amused
.
``
If
you
eat
three
lumps
of
sugar
,
your
*NL*
mother
will
certainly
slap
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
got
to
give
me
some
candy
,
then
,
''
rejoined
his
young
*NL*
interlocutor
.
``
I
ca
n't
get
any
candy
here
--
any
American
candy
.
American
*NL*
candy
's
the
best
candy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
American
little
boys
the
best
little
boys
?
''
asked
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
'm
an
American
boy
,
''
said
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
are
one
of
the
best
!
''
laughed
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
an
American
man
?
''
pursued
this
vivacious
infant
.
And
then
,
*NL*
on
Winterbourne
's
affirmative
reply
--
``
American
men
are
the
best
,
''
he
*NL*
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
thanked
him
for
the
compliment
,
and
the
child
,
who
had
*NL*
now
got
astride
of
his
alpenstock
,
stood
looking
about
him
,
while
he
*NL*
attacked
a
second
lump
of
sugar
.
Winterbourne
wondered
if
he
himself
*NL*
had
been
like
this
in
his
infancy
,
for
he
had
been
brought
to
Europe
at
*NL*
about
this
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
comes
my
sister
!
''
cried
the
child
in
a
moment
.
``
She
's
an
American
*NL*
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
looked
along
the
path
and
saw
a
beautiful
young
lady
*NL*
advancing
.
``
American
girls
are
the
best
girls
,
''
he
said
cheerfully
to
*NL*
his
young
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
ai
n't
the
best
!
''
the
child
declared
.
``
She
's
always
blowing
at
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
that
is
your
fault
,
not
hers
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
The
young
*NL*
lady
meanwhile
had
drawn
near
.
She
was
dressed
in
white
muslin
,
with
a
*NL*
hundred
frills
and
flounces
,
and
knots
of
pale-colored
ribbon
.
She
was
*NL*
bareheaded
,
but
she
balanced
in
her
hand
a
large
parasol
,
with
a
deep
*NL*
border
of
embroidery
;
and
she
was
strikingly
,
admirably
pretty
.
``
How
*NL*
pretty
they
are
!
''
thought
Winterbourne
,
straightening
himself
in
his
*NL*
seat
,
as
if
he
were
prepared
to
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
paused
in
front
of
his
bench
,
near
the
parapet
of
the
*NL*
garden
,
which
overlooked
the
lake
.
The
little
boy
had
now
converted
his
*NL*
alpenstock
into
a
vaulting
pole
,
by
the
aid
of
which
he
was
springing
*NL*
about
in
the
gravel
and
kicking
it
up
not
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Randolph
,
''
said
the
young
lady
,
``
what
ARE
you
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
up
the
Alps
,
''
replied
Randolph
.
``
This
is
the
way
!
''
And
he
*NL*
gave
another
little
jump
,
scattering
the
pebbles
about
Winterbourne
's
*NL*
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
they
come
down
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
American
man
!
''
cried
Randolph
,
in
his
little
hard
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
gave
no
heed
to
this
announcement
,
but
looked
straight
*NL*
at
her
brother
.
``
Well
,
I
guess
you
had
better
be
quiet
,
''
she
simply
*NL*
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Winterbourne
that
he
had
been
in
a
manner
presented
.
He
*NL*
got
up
and
stepped
slowly
toward
the
young
girl
,
throwing
away
his
*NL*
cigarette
.
``
This
little
boy
and
I
have
made
acquaintance
,
''
he
said
,
with
*NL*
great
civility
.
In
Geneva
,
as
he
had
been
perfectly
aware
,
a
young
*NL*
man
was
not
at
liberty
to
speak
to
a
young
unmarried
lady
except
under
*NL*
certain
rarely
occurring
conditions
;
but
here
at
Vevey
,
what
conditions
*NL*
could
be
better
than
these
?
--
a
pretty
American
girl
coming
and
standing
*NL*
in
front
of
you
in
a
garden
.
This
pretty
American
girl
,
however
,
on
*NL*
hearing
Winterbourne
's
observation
,
simply
glanced
at
him
;
she
then
*NL*
turned
her
head
and
looked
over
the
parapet
,
at
the
lake
and
the
*NL*
opposite
mountains
.
He
wondered
whether
he
had
gone
too
far
,
but
he
*NL*
decided
that
he
must
advance
farther
,
rather
than
retreat
.
While
he
was
*NL*
thinking
of
something
else
to
say
,
the
young
lady
turned
to
the
little
*NL*
boy
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
know
where
you
got
that
pole
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bought
it
,
''
responded
Randolph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
're
going
to
take
it
to
Italy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
going
to
take
it
to
Italy
,
''
the
child
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
glanced
over
the
front
of
her
dress
and
smoothed
out
a
*NL*
knot
or
two
of
ribbon
.
Then
she
rested
her
eyes
upon
the
prospect
again
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
guess
you
had
better
leave
it
somewhere
,
''
she
said
after
a
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
Italy
?
''
Winterbourne
inquired
in
a
tone
of
great
*NL*
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
glanced
at
him
again
.
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
she
replied
.
And
she
*NL*
said
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
--
a
--
going
over
the
Simplon
?
''
Winterbourne
pursued
,
a
little
*NL*
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
suppose
it
's
some
mountain
.
Randolph
,
what
*NL*
mountain
are
we
going
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
where
?
''
the
child
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Italy
,
''
Winterbourne
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Randolph
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
go
to
Italy
.
I
want
to
*NL*
go
to
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Italy
is
a
beautiful
place
!
''
rejoined
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
get
candy
there
?
''
Randolph
loudly
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
''
said
his
sister
.
``
I
guess
you
have
had
enough
candy
,
and
*NL*
mother
thinks
so
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
had
any
for
ever
so
long
--
for
a
hundred
weeks
!
''
cried
the
*NL*
boy
,
still
jumping
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
inspected
her
flounces
and
smoothed
her
ribbons
again
;
*NL*
and
Winterbourne
presently
risked
an
observation
upon
the
beauty
of
the
*NL*
view
.
He
was
ceasing
to
be
embarrassed
,
for
he
had
begun
to
perceive
*NL*
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
embarrassed
herself
.
There
had
not
been
*NL*
the
slightest
alteration
in
her
charming
complexion
;
she
was
evidently
*NL*
neither
offended
nor
flattered
.
If
she
looked
another
way
when
he
spoke
*NL*
to
her
,
and
seemed
not
particularly
to
hear
him
,
this
was
simply
her
*NL*
habit
,
her
manner
.
Yet
,
as
he
talked
a
little
more
and
pointed
out
some
*NL*
of
the
objects
of
interest
in
the
view
,
with
which
she
appeared
quite
*NL*
unacquainted
,
she
gradually
gave
him
more
of
the
benefit
of
her
glance
;
*NL*
and
then
he
saw
that
this
glance
was
perfectly
direct
and
unshrinking
.
*NL*
It
was
not
,
however
,
what
would
have
been
called
an
immodest
glance
,
*NL*
for
the
young
girl
's
eyes
were
singularly
honest
and
fresh
.
They
were
*NL*
wonderfully
pretty
eyes
;
and
,
indeed
,
Winterbourne
had
not
seen
for
*NL*
a
long
time
anything
prettier
than
his
fair
countrywoman
's
various
*NL*
features
--
her
complexion
,
her
nose
,
her
ears
,
her
teeth
.
He
had
a
great
*NL*
relish
for
feminine
beauty
;
he
was
addicted
to
observing
and
analyzing
*NL*
it
;
and
as
regards
this
young
lady
's
face
he
made
several
observations
.
*NL*
It
was
not
at
all
insipid
,
but
it
was
not
exactly
expressive
;
and
*NL*
though
it
was
eminently
delicate
,
Winterbourne
mentally
accused
it
--
very
*NL*
forgivingly
--
of
a
want
of
finish
.
He
thought
it
very
possible
that
*NL*
Master
Randolph
's
sister
was
a
coquette
;
he
was
sure
she
had
a
spirit
of
*NL*
her
own
;
but
in
her
bright
,
sweet
,
superficial
little
visage
there
was
*NL*
no
mockery
,
no
irony
.
Before
long
it
became
obvious
that
she
was
much
*NL*
disposed
toward
conversation
.
She
told
him
that
they
were
going
to
Rome
*NL*
for
the
winter
--
she
and
her
mother
and
Randolph
.
She
asked
him
if
he
was
*NL*
a
``
real
American
''
;
she
should
n't
have
taken
him
for
one
;
he
seemed
more
*NL*
like
a
German
--
this
was
said
after
a
little
hesitation
--
especially
when
*NL*
he
spoke
.
Winterbourne
,
laughing
,
answered
that
he
had
met
Germans
who
*NL*
spoke
like
Americans
,
but
that
he
had
not
,
so
far
as
he
remembered
,
met
*NL*
an
American
who
spoke
like
a
German
.
Then
he
asked
her
if
she
should
not
*NL*
be
more
comfortable
in
sitting
upon
the
bench
which
he
had
just
quitted
.
*NL*
She
answered
that
she
liked
standing
up
and
walking
about
;
but
she
*NL*
presently
sat
down
.
She
told
him
she
was
from
New
York
State
--
``
if
you
*NL*
know
where
that
is
.
''
Winterbourne
learned
more
about
her
by
catching
*NL*
hold
of
her
small
,
slippery
brother
and
making
him
stand
a
few
minutes
*NL*
by
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
your
name
,
my
boy
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Randolph
C.
Miller
,
''
said
the
boy
sharply
.
``
And
I
'll
tell
you
her
*NL*
name
;
''
and
he
leveled
his
alpenstock
at
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
wait
till
you
are
asked
!
''
said
this
young
lady
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
very
much
to
know
your
name
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
name
is
Daisy
Miller
!
''
cried
the
child
.
``
But
that
is
n't
her
real
*NL*
name
;
that
is
n't
her
name
on
her
cards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
you
have
n't
got
one
of
my
cards
!
''
said
Miss
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
real
name
is
Annie
P.
Miller
,
''
the
boy
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
HIS
name
,
''
said
his
sister
,
indicating
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
this
point
Randolph
seemed
perfectly
indifferent
;
he
continued
to
*NL*
supply
information
with
regard
to
his
own
family
.
``
My
father
's
name
is
*NL*
Ezra
B.
Miller
,
''
he
announced
.
``
My
father
ai
n't
in
Europe
;
my
father
's
*NL*
in
a
better
place
than
Europe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
imagined
for
a
moment
that
this
was
the
manner
in
which
the
*NL*
child
had
been
taught
to
intimate
that
Mr.
Miller
had
been
removed
to
*NL*
the
sphere
of
celestial
reward
.
But
Randolph
immediately
added
,
``
My
*NL*
father
's
in
Schenectady
.
He
's
got
a
big
business
.
My
father
's
rich
,
you
*NL*
bet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
ejaculated
Miss
Miller
,
lowering
her
parasol
and
looking
at
*NL*
the
embroidered
border
.
Winterbourne
presently
released
the
child
,
*NL*
who
departed
,
dragging
his
alpenstock
along
the
path
.
``
He
does
n't
like
*NL*
Europe
,
''
said
the
young
girl
.
``
He
wants
to
go
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Schenectady
,
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
wants
to
go
right
home
.
He
has
n't
got
any
boys
here
.
There
is
*NL*
one
boy
here
,
but
he
always
goes
round
with
a
teacher
;
they
wo
n't
let
*NL*
him
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
brother
has
n't
any
teacher
?
''
Winterbourne
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
thought
of
getting
him
one
,
to
travel
round
with
us
.
There
was
a
*NL*
lady
told
her
of
a
very
good
teacher
;
an
American
lady
--
perhaps
you
know
*NL*
her
--
Mrs.
Sanders
.
I
think
she
came
from
Boston
.
She
told
her
of
this
*NL*
teacher
,
and
we
thought
of
getting
him
to
travel
round
with
us
.
But
*NL*
Randolph
said
he
did
n't
want
a
teacher
traveling
round
with
us
.
He
said
*NL*
he
would
n't
have
lessons
when
he
was
in
the
cars
.
And
we
ARE
in
the
cars
*NL*
about
half
the
time
.
There
was
an
English
lady
we
met
in
the
cars
--
I
*NL*
think
her
name
was
Miss
Featherstone
;
perhaps
you
know
her
.
She
wanted
*NL*
to
know
why
I
did
n't
give
Randolph
lessons
--
give
him
`
instruction
,
'
she
*NL*
called
it
.
I
guess
he
could
give
me
more
instruction
than
I
could
give
*NL*
him
.
He
's
very
smart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Winterbourne
;
``
he
seems
very
smart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
's
going
to
get
a
teacher
for
him
as
soon
as
we
get
to
Italy
.
Can
*NL*
you
get
good
teachers
in
Italy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
I
should
think
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
else
she
's
going
to
find
some
school
.
He
ought
to
learn
some
more
.
*NL*
He
's
only
nine
.
He
's
going
to
college
.
''
And
in
this
way
Miss
Miller
*NL*
continued
to
converse
upon
the
affairs
of
her
family
and
upon
other
*NL*
topics
.
She
sat
there
with
her
extremely
pretty
hands
,
ornamented
with
*NL*
very
brilliant
rings
,
folded
in
her
lap
,
and
with
her
pretty
eyes
now
*NL*
resting
upon
those
of
Winterbourne
,
now
wandering
over
the
garden
,
the
*NL*
people
who
passed
by
,
and
the
beautiful
view
.
She
talked
to
Winterbourne
*NL*
as
if
she
had
known
him
a
long
time
.
He
found
it
very
pleasant
.
It
was
*NL*
many
years
since
he
had
heard
a
young
girl
talk
so
much
.
It
might
have
*NL*
been
said
of
this
unknown
young
lady
,
who
had
come
and
sat
down
beside
*NL*
him
upon
a
bench
,
that
she
chattered
.
She
was
very
quiet
;
she
sat
in
a
*NL*
charming
,
tranquil
attitude
;
but
her
lips
and
her
eyes
were
constantly
*NL*
moving
.
She
had
a
soft
,
slender
,
agreeable
voice
,
and
her
tone
was
*NL*
decidedly
sociable
.
She
gave
Winterbourne
a
history
of
her
movements
*NL*
and
intentions
and
those
of
her
mother
and
brother
,
in
Europe
,
and
*NL*
enumerated
,
in
particular
,
the
various
hotels
at
which
they
had
stopped
.
*NL*
``
That
English
lady
in
the
cars
,
''
she
said
--
``
Miss
Featherstone
--
asked
me
*NL*
if
we
did
n't
all
live
in
hotels
in
America
.
I
told
her
I
had
never
been
*NL*
in
so
many
hotels
in
my
life
as
since
I
came
to
Europe
.
I
have
never
*NL*
seen
so
many
--
it
's
nothing
but
hotels
.
''
But
Miss
Miller
did
not
make
*NL*
this
remark
with
a
querulous
accent
;
she
appeared
to
be
in
the
best
*NL*
humor
with
everything
.
She
declared
that
the
hotels
were
very
good
,
when
*NL*
once
you
got
used
to
their
ways
,
and
that
Europe
was
perfectly
sweet
.
*NL*
She
was
not
disappointed
--
not
a
bit
.
Perhaps
it
was
because
she
had
*NL*
heard
so
much
about
it
before
.
She
had
ever
so
many
intimate
friends
*NL*
that
had
been
there
ever
so
many
times
.
And
then
she
had
had
ever
so
*NL*
many
dresses
and
things
from
Paris
.
Whenever
she
put
on
a
Paris
dress
*NL*
she
felt
as
if
she
were
in
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
kind
of
a
wishing
cap
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Miss
Miller
without
examining
this
analogy
;
``
it
always
made
*NL*
me
wish
I
was
here
.
But
I
need
n't
have
done
that
for
dresses
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
they
send
all
the
pretty
ones
to
America
;
you
see
the
most
frightful
*NL*
things
here
.
The
only
thing
I
do
n't
like
,
''
she
proceeded
,
``
is
the
*NL*
society
.
There
is
n't
any
society
;
or
,
if
there
is
,
I
do
n't
know
where
it
*NL*
keeps
itself
.
Do
you
?
I
suppose
there
is
some
society
somewhere
,
but
I
*NL*
have
n't
seen
anything
of
it
.
I
'm
very
fond
of
society
,
and
I
have
always
*NL*
had
a
great
deal
of
it
.
I
do
n't
mean
only
in
Schenectady
,
but
in
New
*NL*
York
.
I
used
to
go
to
New
York
every
winter
.
In
New
York
I
had
lots
of
*NL*
society
.
Last
winter
I
had
seventeen
dinners
given
me
;
and
three
of
them
*NL*
were
by
gentlemen
,
''
added
Daisy
Miller
.
``
I
have
more
friends
in
New
York
*NL*
than
in
Schenectady
--
more
gentleman
friends
;
and
more
young
lady
friends
*NL*
too
,
''
she
resumed
in
a
moment
.
She
paused
again
for
an
instant
;
she
was
*NL*
looking
at
Winterbourne
with
all
her
prettiness
in
her
lively
eyes
and
*NL*
in
her
light
,
slightly
monotonous
smile
.
``
I
have
always
had
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
a
great
deal
of
gentlemen
's
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Winterbourne
was
amused
,
perplexed
,
and
decidedly
charmed
.
He
*NL*
had
never
yet
heard
a
young
girl
express
herself
in
just
this
fashion
;
*NL*
never
,
at
least
,
save
in
cases
where
to
say
such
things
seemed
a
kind
of
*NL*
demonstrative
evidence
of
a
certain
laxity
of
deportment
.
And
yet
was
he
*NL*
to
accuse
Miss
Daisy
Miller
of
actual
or
potential
inconduite
,
as
they
*NL*
said
at
Geneva
?
He
felt
that
he
had
lived
at
Geneva
so
long
that
he
*NL*
had
lost
a
good
deal
;
he
had
become
dishabituated
to
the
American
tone
.
*NL*
Never
,
indeed
,
since
he
had
grown
old
enough
to
appreciate
things
,
had
*NL*
he
encountered
a
young
American
girl
of
so
pronounced
a
type
as
this
.
*NL*
Certainly
she
was
very
charming
,
but
how
deucedly
sociable
!
Was
she
*NL*
simply
a
pretty
girl
from
New
York
State
?
Were
they
all
like
that
,
the
*NL*
pretty
girls
who
had
a
good
deal
of
gentlemen
's
society
?
Or
was
she
also
*NL*
a
designing
,
an
audacious
,
an
unscrupulous
young
person
?
Winterbourne
*NL*
had
lost
his
instinct
in
this
matter
,
and
his
reason
could
not
help
him
.
*NL*
Miss
Daisy
Miller
looked
extremely
innocent
.
Some
people
had
told
him
*NL*
that
,
after
all
,
American
girls
were
exceedingly
innocent
;
and
others
*NL*
had
told
him
that
,
after
all
,
they
were
not
.
He
was
inclined
to
think
*NL*
Miss
Daisy
Miller
was
a
flirt
--
a
pretty
American
flirt
.
He
had
never
,
as
*NL*
yet
,
had
any
relations
with
young
ladies
of
this
category
.
He
had
*NL*
known
,
here
in
Europe
,
two
or
three
women
--
persons
older
than
Miss
Daisy
*NL*
Miller
,
and
provided
,
for
respectability
's
sake
,
with
husbands
--
who
were
*NL*
great
coquettes
--
dangerous
,
terrible
women
,
with
whom
one
's
relations
*NL*
were
liable
to
take
a
serious
turn
.
But
this
young
girl
was
not
a
*NL*
coquette
in
that
sense
;
she
was
very
unsophisticated
;
she
was
only
a
*NL*
pretty
American
flirt
.
Winterbourne
was
almost
grateful
for
having
found
*NL*
the
formula
that
applied
to
Miss
Daisy
Miller
.
He
leaned
back
in
his
*NL*
seat
;
he
remarked
to
himself
that
she
had
the
most
charming
nose
he
had
*NL*
ever
seen
;
he
wondered
what
were
the
regular
conditions
and
limitations
*NL*
of
one
's
intercourse
with
a
pretty
American
flirt
.
It
presently
became
*NL*
apparent
that
he
was
on
the
way
to
learn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
to
that
old
castle
?
''
asked
the
young
girl
,
pointing
with
*NL*
her
parasol
to
the
far-gleaming
walls
of
the
Chateau
de
Chillon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
formerly
,
more
than
once
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
``
You
too
,
I
suppose
,
*NL*
have
seen
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
we
have
n't
been
there
.
I
want
to
go
there
dreadfully
.
Of
course
I
*NL*
mean
to
go
there
.
I
would
n't
go
away
from
here
without
having
seen
that
*NL*
old
castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
very
pretty
excursion
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
``
and
very
easy
to
*NL*
make

You
can
drive

you
know

you
can
go
by

little
steamer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
go
in

said
Miss
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
can
go
in
the
cars

Winterbourne
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
courier
says
they
take
you
right
up
to
the
castle

''
the
young
girl
*NL*
continued
.
``
We
were
going
last
week
,
but
my
mother
gave
out
.
She
suffers
*NL*
dreadfully
from
dyspepsia
.
She
said
she
could
n't
go
.
Randolph
would
n't
*NL*
go
either
;
he
says
he
does
n't
think
much
of
old
castles
.
But
I
guess
*NL*
we
'll
go
this
week
,
if
we
can
get
Randolph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
brother
is
not
interested
in
ancient
monuments
?
''
Winterbourne
*NL*
inquired
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
he
do
n't
care
much
about
old
castles

He
's
only
nine
.
He
*NL*
wants
to
stay
at
the
hotel
.
Mother
's
afraid
to
leave
him
alone
,
and
the
*NL*
courier
wo
n't
stay
with
him
;
so
we
have
n't
been
to
many
places
.
But
it
*NL*
will
be
too
bad
if
we
do
n't
go
up
there
.
''
And
Miss
Miller
pointed
again
*NL*
at
the
Chateau
de
Chillon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
might
be
arranged
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
``
Could
n't
you
*NL*
get
some
one
to
stay
for
the
afternoon
with
Randolph
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Miller
looked
at
him
a
moment
,
and
then
,
very
placidly
,
``
I
wish
YOU
*NL*
would
stay
with
him
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
hesitated
a
moment
.
``
I
should
much
rather
go
to
Chillon
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
?
''
asked
the
young
girl
with
the
same
placidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
n't
rise
,
blushing
,
as
a
young
girl
at
Geneva
would
have
done
;
*NL*
and
yet
Winterbourne
,
conscious
that
he
had
been
very
bold
,
thought
*NL*
it
possible
she
was
offended
.
``
With
your
mother
,
''
he
answered
very
*NL*
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
seemed
that
both
his
audacity
and
his
respect
were
lost
upon
Miss
*NL*
Daisy
Miller
.
``
I
guess
my
mother
wo
n't
go
,
after
all
,
''
she
said
.
``
She
*NL*
do
n't
like
to
ride
round
in
the
afternoon
.
But
did
you
really
mean
what
*NL*
you
said
just
now
--
that
you
would
like
to
go
up
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
earnestly
,
''
Winterbourne
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
may
arrange
it
.
If
mother
will
stay
with
Randolph
,
I
guess
*NL*
Eugenio
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eugenio
?
''
the
young
man
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eugenio
's
our
courier
.
He
does
n't
like
to
stay
with
Randolph
;
he
's
the
*NL*
most
fastidious
man
I
ever
saw
.
But
he
's
a
splendid
courier
.
I
guess
*NL*
he
'll
stay
at
home
with
Randolph
if
mother
does
,
and
then
we
can
go
to
*NL*
the
castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
reflected
for
an
instant
as
lucidly
as
possible
--
``
we
''
could
*NL*
only
mean
Miss
Daisy
Miller
and
himself
.
This
program
seemed
almost
too
*NL*
agreeable
for
credence
;
he
felt
as
if
he
ought
to
kiss
the
young
lady
's
*NL*
hand
.
Possibly
he
would
have
done
so
and
quite
spoiled
the
project
,
but
*NL*
at
this
moment
another
person
,
presumably
Eugenio
,
appeared
.
A
tall
,
*NL*
handsome
man
,
with
superb
whiskers
,
wearing
a
velvet
morning
coat
and
*NL*
a
brilliant
watch
chain
,
approached
Miss
Miller
,
looking
sharply
at
her
*NL*
companion
.
``
Oh
,
Eugenio
!
''
said
Miss
Miller
with
the
friendliest
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eugenio
had
looked
at
Winterbourne
from
head
to
foot
;
he
now
bowed
*NL*
gravely
to
the
young
lady
.
``
I
have
the
honor
to
inform
mademoiselle
that
*NL*
luncheon
is
upon
the
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Miller
slowly
rose
.
``
See
here
,
Eugenio
!
''
she
said
;
``
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
that
old
castle
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Chateau
de
Chillon
,
mademoiselle
?
''
the
courier
inquired
.
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
has
made
arrangements
?
''
he
added
in
a
tone
which
struck
*NL*
Winterbourne
as
very
impertinent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eugenio
's
tone
apparently
threw
,
even
to
Miss
Miller
's
own
apprehension
,
*NL*
a
slightly
ironical
light
upon
the
young
girl
's
situation
.
She
turned
*NL*
to
Winterbourne
,
blushing
a
little
--
a
very
little
.
``
You
wo
n't
back
out
?
''
*NL*
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
be
happy
till
we
go
!
''
he
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
staying
in
this
hotel
?
''
she
went
on
.
``
And
you
are
really
an
*NL*
American
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
courier
stood
looking
at
Winterbourne
offensively
.
The
young
man
,
*NL*
at
least
,
thought
his
manner
of
looking
an
offense
to
Miss
Miller
;
it
*NL*
conveyed
an
imputation
that
she
``
picked
up
''
acquaintances
.
``
I
shall
have
*NL*
the
honor
of
presenting
to
you
a
person
who
will
tell
you
all
about
me
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
smiling
and
referring
to
his
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
we
'll
go
some
day
,
''
said
Miss
Miller
.
And
she
gave
him
a
*NL*
smile
and
turned
away
.
She
put
up
her
parasol
and
walked
back
to
the
inn
*NL*
beside
Eugenio
.
Winterbourne
stood
looking
after
her
;
and
as
she
moved
*NL*
away
,
drawing
her
muslin
furbelows
over
the
gravel
,
said
to
himself
that
*NL*
she
had
the
tournure
of
a
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
however
,
engaged
to
do
more
than
proved
feasible
,
in
promising
*NL*
to
present
his
aunt
,
Mrs.
Costello
,
to
Miss
Daisy
Miller
.
As
soon
as
the
*NL*
former
lady
had
got
better
of
her
headache
,
he
waited
upon
her
in
her
*NL*
apartment
;
and
,
after
the
proper
inquiries
in
regard
to
her
health
,
he
*NL*
asked
her
if
she
had
observed
in
the
hotel
an
American
family
--
a
mamma
,
*NL*
a
daughter
,
and
a
little
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
courier
?
''
said
Mrs.
Costello
.
``
Oh
yes
,
I
have
observed
them
.
Seen
*NL*
them
--
heard
them
--
and
kept
out
of
their
way
.
''
Mrs.
Costello
was
a
widow
*NL*
with
a
fortune
;
a
person
of
much
distinction
,
who
frequently
intimated
*NL*
that
,
if
she
were
not
so
dreadfully
liable
to
sick
headaches
,
she
would
*NL*
probably
have
left
a
deeper
impress
upon
her
time
.
She
had
a
long
,
pale
*NL*
face
,
a
high
nose
,
and
a
great
deal
of
very
striking
white
hair
,
which
*NL*
she
wore
in
large
puffs
and
rouleaux
over
the
top
of
her
head
.
She
had
*NL*
two
sons
married
in
New
York
and
another
who
was
now
in
Europe
.
This
*NL*
young
man
was
amusing
himself
at
Hamburg
,
and
,
though
he
was
on
his
*NL*
travels
,
was
rarely
perceived
to
visit
any
particular
city
at
the
moment
*NL*
selected
by
his
mother
for
her
own
appearance
there
.
Her
nephew
,
who
had
*NL*
come
up
to
Vevey
expressly
to
see
her
,
was
therefore
more
attentive
than
*NL*
those
who
,
as
she
said
,
were
nearer
to
her
.
He
had
imbibed
at
Geneva
the
*NL*
idea
that
one
must
always
be
attentive
to
one
's
aunt
.
Mrs.
Costello
*NL*
had
not
seen
him
for
many
years
,
and
she
was
greatly
pleased
with
him
,
*NL*
manifesting
her
approbation
by
initiating
him
into
many
of
the
secrets
*NL*
of
that
social
sway
which
,
as
she
gave
him
to
understand
,
she
exerted
in
*NL*
the
American
capital
.
She
admitted
that
she
was
very
exclusive
;
but
,
if
*NL*
he
were
acquainted
with
New
York
,
he
would
see
that
one
had
to
be
.
And
*NL*
her
picture
of
the
minutely
hierarchical
constitution
of
the
society
of
*NL*
that
city
,
which
she
presented
to
him
in
many
different
lights
,
was
,
to
*NL*
Winterbourne
's
imagination
,
almost
oppressively
striking
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
perceived
,
from
her
tone
,
that
Miss
Daisy
Miller
's
place
*NL*
in
the
social
scale
was
low
.
``
I
am
afraid
you
do
n't
approve
of
them
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
very
common
,
''
Mrs.
Costello
declared
.
``
They
are
the
sort
of
*NL*
Americans
that
one
does
one
's
duty
by
not
--
not
accepting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
n't
accept
them
?
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
,
my
dear
Frederick
.
I
would
if
I
could
,
but
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
girl
is
very
pretty
,
''
said
Winterbourne
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
's
pretty
.
But
she
is
very
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
what
you
mean
,
of
course
,
''
said
Winterbourne
after
another
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
that
charming
look
that
they
all
have
,
''
his
aunt
resumed
.
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
think
where
they
pick
it
up
;
and
she
dresses
in
perfection
--
no
,
*NL*
you
do
n't
know
how
well
she
dresses
.
I
ca
n't
think
where
they
get
their
*NL*
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
aunt
,
she
is
not
,
after
all
,
a
Comanche
savage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
young
lady
,
''
said
Mrs.
Costello
,
``
who
has
an
intimacy
with
her
*NL*
mamma
's
courier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
intimacy
with
the
courier
?
''
the
young
man
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
mother
is
just
as
bad
!
They
treat
the
courier
like
a
familiar
*NL*
friend
--
like
a
gentleman
.
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
dines
with
them
.
*NL*
Very
likely
they
have
never
seen
a
man
with
such
good
manners
,
such
*NL*
fine
clothes
,
so
like
a
gentleman
.
He
probably
corresponds
to
the
young
*NL*
lady
's
idea
of
a
count
.
He
sits
with
them
in
the
garden
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
I
think
he
smokes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
listened
with
interest
to
these
disclosures
;
they
helped
*NL*
him
to
make
up
his
mind
about
Miss
Daisy
.
Evidently
she
was
rather
wild
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
am
not
a
courier
,
and
yet
she
was
very
charming
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
have
said
at
first
,
''
said
Mrs.
Costello
with
dignity
,
*NL*
``
that
you
had
made
her
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
simply
met
in
the
garden
,
and
we
talked
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tout
bonnement
!
And
pray
what
did
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
I
should
take
the
liberty
of
introducing
her
to
my
admirable

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

said
Winterbourne

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
who

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
the
young

``
She

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do

Mrs.

observed

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
completely
uncultivated

Winterbourne
went
on

*NL*
``
You

may
I
ask

when
this
interesting

*NL*

known

an

Winterbourne

smiling

cried
Mrs.
Costello

``
What
a
dreadful

Her

was
silent
for
some
moments

began
earnestly
,

with
a
desire

trustworthy
information

But
he
paused
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
what

said
his
aunt

*NL*
*NL*
``

off

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
But
do
n't
they
all
do
these
things
--
the
young
girls
in
America
?
''
*NL*
Winterbourne
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Costello
stared
a
moment
.
``
I
should
like
to
see
my
granddaughters
*NL*
do
them
!
''
she
declared
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
to
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
,
for
Winterbourne
*NL*
remembered
to
have
heard
that
his
pretty
cousins
in
New
York
were
*NL*
``
tremendous
flirts
.
''
If
,
therefore
,
Miss
Daisy
Miller
exceeded
the
*NL*
liberal
margin
allowed
to
these
young
ladies
,
it
was
probable
that
*NL*
anything
might
be
expected
of
her
.
Winterbourne
was
impatient
to
see
her
*NL*
again
,
and
he
was
vexed
with
himself
that
,
by
instinct
,
he
should
not
*NL*
appreciate
her
justly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
was
impatient
to
see
her
,
he
hardly
knew
what
he
should
say
*NL*
to
her
about
his
aunt
's
refusal
to
become
acquainted
with
her
;
but
he
*NL*
discovered
,
promptly
enough
,
that
with
Miss
Daisy
Miller
there
was
*NL*
no
great
need
of
walking
on
tiptoe
.
He
found
her
that
evening
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
wandering
about
in
the
warm
starlight
like
an
indolent
sylph
,
*NL*
and
swinging
to
and
fro
the
largest
fan
he
had
ever
beheld
.
It
was
ten
*NL*
o'clock
.
He
had
dined
with
his
aunt
,
had
been
sitting
with
her
since
*NL*
dinner
,
and
had
just
taken
leave
of
her
till
the
morrow
.
Miss
Daisy
*NL*
Miller
seemed
very
glad
to
see
him
;
she
declared
it
was
the
longest
*NL*
evening
she
had
ever
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
all
alone
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
walking
round
with
mother
.
But
mother
gets
tired
walking
*NL*
round
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
gone
to
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
she
does
n't
like
to
go
to
bed
,
''
said
the
young
girl
.
``
She
does
n't
*NL*
sleep
--
not
three
hours
.
She
says
she
does
n't
know
how
she
lives
.
She
's
*NL*
dreadfully
nervous
.
I
guess
she
sleeps
more
than
she
thinks
.
She
's
gone
*NL*
somewhere
after
Randolph
;
she
wants
to
try
to
get
him
to
go
to
bed
.
He
*NL*
does
n't
like
to
go
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
hope
she
will
persuade
him
,
''
observed
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
talk
to
him
all
she
can
;
but
he
does
n't
like
her
to
talk
*NL*
to
him
,
''
said
Miss
Daisy
,
opening
her
fan
.
``
She
's
going
to
try
to
get
*NL*
Eugenio
to
talk
to
him
.
But
he
is
n't
afraid
of
Eugenio
.
Eugenio
's
a
*NL*
splendid
courier
,
but
he
ca
n't
make
much
impression
on
Randolph
!
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
he
'll
go
to
bed
before
eleven
.
''
It
appeared
that
Randolph
's
*NL*
vigil
was
in
fact
triumphantly
prolonged
,
for
Winterbourne
strolled
*NL*
about
with
the
young
girl
for
some
time
without
meeting
her
mother
.
``
I
*NL*
have
been
looking
round
for
that
lady
you
want
to
introduce
me
to
,
''
his
*NL*
companion
resumed
.
``
She
's
your
aunt
.
''
Then
,
on
Winterbourne
's
admitting
*NL*
the
fact
and
expressing
some
curiosity
as
to
how
she
had
learned
it
,
she
*NL*
said
she
had
heard
all
about
Mrs.
Costello
from
the
chambermaid
.
She
was
*NL*
very
quiet
and
very
comme
il
faut
;
she
wore
white
puffs
;
she
spoke
to
no
*NL*
one
,
and
she
never
dined
at
the
table
d'hote
.
Every
two
days
she
had
a
*NL*
headache
.
``
I
think
that
's
a
lovely
description
,
headache
and
all
!
''
said
*NL*
Miss
Daisy
,
chattering
along
in
her
thin
,
gay
voice
.
``
I
want
to
know
her
*NL*
ever
so
much
.
I
know
just
what
YOUR
aunt
would
be
;
I
know
I
should
like
*NL*
her
.
She
would
be
very
exclusive
.
I
like
a
lady
to
be
exclusive
;
I
'm
*NL*
dying
to
be
exclusive
myself
.
Well
,
we
ARE
exclusive
,
mother
and
I
.
We
*NL*
do
n't
speak
to
everyone
--
or
they
do
n't
speak
to
us
.
I
suppose
it
's
about
*NL*
the
same
thing
.
Anyway
,
I
shall
be
ever
so
glad
to
know
your
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
was
embarrassed
.
``
She
would
be
most
happy
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
I
*NL*
am
afraid
those
headaches
will
interfere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
looked
at
him
through
the
dusk
.
``
But
I
suppose
she
*NL*
does
n't
have
a
headache
every
day
,
''
she
said
sympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
was
silent
a
moment
.
``
She
tells
me
she
does
,
''
he
answered
*NL*
at
last
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Daisy
Miller
stopped
and
stood
looking
at
him
.
Her
prettiness
was
*NL*
still
visible
in
the
darkness
;
she
was
opening
and
closing
her
enormous
*NL*
fan
.
``
She
does
n't
want
to
know
me
!
''
she
said
suddenly
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
*NL*
say
so
?
You
need
n't
be
afraid
.
I
'm
not
afraid
!
''
And
she
gave
a
little
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
fancied
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
voice
;
he
was
touched
,
*NL*
shocked
,
mortified
by
it
.
``
My
dear
young
lady
,
''
he
protested
,
``
she
knows
*NL*
no
one
.
It
's
her
wretched
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
walked
on
a
few
steps
,
laughing
still
.
``
You
need
n't
be
*NL*
afraid
,
''
she
repeated
.
``
Why
should
she
want
to
know
me
?
''
Then
she
paused
*NL*
again
;
she
was
close
to
the
parapet
of
the
garden
,
and
in
front
of
her
*NL*
was
the
starlit
lake
.
There
was
a
vague
sheen
upon
its
surface
,
and
in
*NL*
the
distance
were
dimly
seen
mountain
forms
.
Daisy
Miller
looked
out
*NL*
upon
the
mysterious
prospect
and
then
she
gave
another
little
laugh
.
*NL*
``
Gracious
!
she
IS
exclusive
!
''
she
said
.
Winterbourne
wondered
whether
*NL*
she
was
seriously
wounded
,
and
for
a
moment
almost
wished
that
her
sense
*NL*
of
injury
might
be
such
as
to
make
it
becoming
in
him
to
attempt
to
*NL*
reassure
and
comfort
her
.
He
had
a
pleasant
sense
that
she
would
be
very
*NL*
approachable
for
consolatory
purposes
.
He
felt
then
,
for
the
instant
,
*NL*
quite
ready
to
sacrifice
his
aunt
,
conversationally
;
to
admit
that
she
*NL*
was
a
proud
,
rude
woman
,
and
to
declare
that
they
need
n't
mind
her
.
*NL*
But
before
he
had
time
to
commit
himself
to
this
perilous
mixture
*NL*
of
gallantry
and
impiety
,
the
young
lady
,
resuming
her
walk
,
gave
an
*NL*
exclamation
in
quite
another
tone
.
``
Well
,
here
's
Mother
!
I
guess
she
*NL*
has
n't
got
Randolph
to
go
to
bed
.
''
The
figure
of
a
lady
appeared
at
a
*NL*
distance
,
very
indistinct
in
the
darkness
,
and
advancing
with
a
slow
and
*NL*
wavering
movement
.
Suddenly
it
seemed
to
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
it
is
your
mother
?
Can
you
distinguish
her
in
this
thick
*NL*
dusk
?
''
Winterbourne
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
cried
Miss
Daisy
Miller
with
a
laugh
;
``
I
guess
I
know
my
own
*NL*
mother
.
And
when
she
has
got
on
my
shawl
,
too
!
She
is
always
wearing
my
*NL*
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
in
question
,
ceasing
to
advance
,
hovered
vaguely
about
the
spot
*NL*
at
which
she
had
checked
her
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
your
mother
does
n't
see
you
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
``
Or
perhaps
,
''
he
added
,
thinking
,
with
Miss
Miller
,
the
joke
*NL*
permissible
--
``
perhaps
she
feels
guilty
about
your
shawl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
a
fearful
old
thing
!
''
the
young
girl
replied
serenely
.
``
I
told
*NL*
her
she
could
wear
it
.
She
wo
n't
come
here
because
she
sees
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
``
I
had
better
leave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
come
on
!
''
urged
Miss
Daisy
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
your
mother
does
n't
approve
of
my
walking
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Miller
gave
him
a
serious
glance
.
``
It
is
n't
for
me
;
it
's
for
*NL*
you
--
that
is
,
it
's
for
HER
.
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
who
it
's
for
!
But
mother
*NL*
does
n't
like
any
of
my
gentlemen
friends
.
She
's
right
down
timid
.
She
*NL*
always
makes
a
fuss
if
I
introduce
a
gentleman
.
But
I
DO
introduce
*NL*
them
--
almost
always
.
If
I
did
n't
introduce
my
gentlemen
friends
to
*NL*
Mother
,
''
the
young
girl
added
in
her
little
soft
,
flat
monotone
,
``
I
*NL*
should
n't
think
I
was
natural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
introduce
me
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
``
you
must
know
my
name
.
''
And
he
*NL*
proceeded
to
pronounce
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
I
ca
n't
say
all
that
!
''
said
his
companion
with
a
laugh
.
But
*NL*
by
this
time
they
had
come
up
to
Mrs.
Miller
,
who
,
as
they
drew
near
,
*NL*
walked
to
the
parapet
of
the
garden
and
leaned
upon
it
,
looking
intently
*NL*
at
the
lake
and
turning
her
back
to
them
.
``
Mother
!
''
said
the
young
*NL*
girl
in
a
tone
of
decision
.
Upon
this
the
elder
lady
turned
round
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Winterbourne
,
''
said
Miss
Daisy
Miller
,
introducing
the
young
man
very
*NL*
frankly
and
prettily
.
``
Common
,
''
she
was
,
as
Mrs.
Costello
had
pronounced
*NL*
her
;
yet
it
was
a
wonder
to
Winterbourne
that
,
with
her
commonness
,
she
*NL*
had
a
singularly
delicate
grace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
was
a
small
,
spare
,
light
person
,
with
a
wandering
eye
,
*NL*
a
very
exiguous
nose
,
and
a
large
forehead
,
decorated
with
a
certain
*NL*
amount
of
thin
,
much
frizzled
hair
.
Like
her
daughter
,
Mrs.
Miller
was
*NL*
dressed
with
extreme
elegance
;
she
had
enormous
diamonds
in
her
ears
.
*NL*
So
far
as
Winterbourne
could
observe
,
she
gave
him
no
greeting
--
she
*NL*
certainly
was
not
looking
at
him
.
Daisy
was
near
her
,
pulling
her
shawl
*NL*
straight
.
``
What
are
you
doing
,
poking
round
here
?
''
this
young
lady
*NL*
inquired
,
but
by
no
means
with
that
harshness
of
accent
which
her
choice
*NL*
of
words
may
imply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
her
mother
,
turning
toward
the
lake
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
think
you
'd
want
that
shawl
!
''
Daisy
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
I
do
!
''
her
mother
answered
with
a
little
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
get
Randolph
to
go
to
bed
?
''
asked
the
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
could
n't
induce
him
,
''
said
Mrs.
Miller
very
gently
.
``
He
wants
to
*NL*
talk
to
the
waiter
.
He
likes
to
talk
to
that
waiter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
telling
Mr.
Winterbourne
,
''
the
young
girl
went
on
;
and
to
the
*NL*
young
man
's
ear
her
tone
might
have
indicated
that
she
had
been
uttering
*NL*
his
name
all
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
said
Winterbourne
;
``
I
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
your
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Randolph
's
mamma
was
silent
;
she
turned
her
attention
to
the
lake
.
But
*NL*
at
last
she
spoke
.
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
see
how
he
lives
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
it
is
n't
so
bad
as
it
was
at
Dover
,
''
said
Daisy
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
occurred
at
Dover
?
''
Winterbourne
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
go
to
bed
at
all
.
I
guess
he
sat
up
all
night
in
the
public
*NL*
parlor
.
He
was
n't
in
bed
at
twelve
o'clock
:
I
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
half-past
twelve
,
''
declared
Mrs.
Miller
with
mild
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
sleep
much
during
the
day
?
''
Winterbourne
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
he
does
n't
sleep
much
,
''
Daisy
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
he
would
!
''
said
her
mother
.
``
It
seems
as
if
he
could
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
's
real
tiresome
,
''
Daisy
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
for
some
moments
,
there
was
silence
.
``
Well
,
Daisy
Miller
,
''
said
*NL*
the
elder
lady
,
presently
,
``
I
should
n't
think
you
'd
want
to
talk
against
*NL*
your
own
brother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
IS
tiresome
,
Mother
,
''
said
Daisy
,
quite
without
the
asperity
*NL*
of
a
retort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
only
nine
,
''
urged
Mrs.
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
would
n't
go
to
that
castle
,
''
said
the
young
girl
.
``
I
'm
going
*NL*
there
with
Mr.
Winterbourne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
announcement
,
very
placidly
made
,
Daisy
's
mamma
offered
no
*NL*
response
.
Winterbourne
took
for
granted
that
she
deeply
disapproved
of
*NL*
the
projected
excursion
;
but
he
said
to
himself
that
she
was
a
simple
,
*NL*
easily
managed
person
,
and
that
a
few
deferential
protestations
would
*NL*
take
the
edge
from
her
displeasure
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
began
;
``
your
daughter
has
*NL*
kindly
allowed
me
the
honor
of
being
her
guide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Miller
's
wandering
eyes
attached
themselves
,
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
appealing
air
,
to
Daisy
,
who
,
however
,
strolled
a
few
steps
farther
,
*NL*
gently
humming
to
herself
.
``
I
presume
you
will
go
in
the
cars
,
''
said
her
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
or
in
the
boat
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
course
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
Mrs.
Miller
rejoined
.
``
I
have
never
*NL*
been
to
that
castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity
you
should
n't
go
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
beginning
to
feel
*NL*
reassured
as
to
her
opposition
.
And
yet
he
was
quite
prepared
to
find
*NL*
that
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
she
meant
to
accompany
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
been
thinking
ever
so
much
about
going
,
''
she
pursued
;
``
but
it
*NL*
seems
as
if
we
could
n't
.
Of
course
Daisy
--
she
wants
to
go
round
.
But
*NL*
there
's
a
lady
here
--
I
do
n't
know
her
name
--
she
says
she
should
n't
think
*NL*
we
'd
want
to
go
to
see
castles
HERE
;
she
should
think
we
'd
want
to
wait
*NL*
till
we
got
to
Italy
.
It
seems
as
if
there
would
be
so
many
there
,
''
*NL*
continued
Mrs.
Miller
with
an
air
of
increasing
confidence
.
``
Of
course
*NL*
we
only
want
to
see
the
principal
ones
.
We
visited
several
in
England
,
''
*NL*
she
presently
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
!
in
England
there
are
beautiful
castles
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
``
But
Chillon
here
,
is
very
well
worth
seeing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
Daisy
feels
up
to
it
--
''
said
Mrs.
Miller
,
in
a
tone
*NL*
impregnated
with
a
sense
of
the
magnitude
of
the
enterprise
.
``
It
seems
*NL*
as
if
there
was
nothing
she
would
n't
undertake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
think
she
'll
enjoy
it
!
''
Winterbourne
declared
.
And
he
desired
*NL*
more
and
more
to
make
it
a
certainty
that
he
was
to
have
the
privilege
*NL*
of
a
tete-a-tete
with
the
young
lady
,
who
was
still
strolling
along
*NL*
in
front
of
them
,
softly
vocalizing
.
``
You
are
not
disposed
,
madam
,
''
he
*NL*
inquired
,
``
to
undertake
it
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
's
mother
looked
at
him
an
instant
askance
,
and
then
walked
forward
*NL*
in
silence
.
Then
--
``
I
guess
she
had
better
go
alone
,
''
she
said
simply
.
*NL*
Winterbourne
observed
to
himself
that
this
was
a
very
different
type
of
*NL*
maternity
from
that
of
the
vigilant
matrons
who
massed
themselves
in
the
*NL*
forefront
of
social
intercourse
in
the
dark
old
city
at
the
other
end
of
*NL*
the
lake
.
But
his
meditations
were
interrupted
by
hearing
his
name
very
*NL*
distinctly
pronounced
by
Mrs.
Miller
's
unprotected
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Winterbourne
!
''
murmured
Daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
!
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
take
me
out
in
a
boat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
present
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
!
''
said
Daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Annie
Miller
!
''
exclaimed
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
,
madam
,
to
let
her
go
,
''
said
Winterbourne
ardently
;
for
*NL*
he
had
never
yet
enjoyed
the
sensation
of
guiding
through
the
summer
*NL*
starlight
a
skiff
freighted
with
a
fresh
and
beautiful
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
think
she
'd
want
to
,
''
said
her
mother
.
``
I
should
think
*NL*
she
'd
rather
go
indoors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
Mr.
Winterbourne
wants
to
take
me
,
''
Daisy
declared
.
``
He
's
so
*NL*
awfully
devoted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
row
you
over
to
Chillon
in
the
starlight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
!
''
said
Daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
ejaculated
the
elder
lady
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
spoken
to
me
for
half
an
hour
,
''
her
daughter
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
having
some
very
pleasant
conversation
with
your
mother
,
''
*NL*
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
want
you
to
take
me
out
in
a
boat
!
''
Daisy
repeated
.
They
had
*NL*
all
stopped
,
and
she
had
turned
round
and
was
looking
at
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
Her
face
wore
a
charming
smile
,
her
pretty
eyes
were
gleaming
,
she
was
*NL*
swinging
her
great
fan
about
.
No
;
it
's
impossible
to
be
prettier
than
*NL*
that
,
thought
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
half
a
dozen
boats
moored
at
that
landing
place
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
pointing
to
certain
steps
which
descended
from
the
garden
to
the
lake
.
*NL*
``
If
you
will
do
me
the
honor
to
accept
my
arm
,
we
will
go
and
select
one
*NL*
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
stood
there
smiling
;
she
threw
back
her
head
and
gave
a
little
,
*NL*
light
laugh
.
``
I
like
a
gentleman
to
be
formal
!
''
she
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
it
's
a
formal
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
bound
I
would
make
you
say
something
,
''
Daisy
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
it
's
not
very
difficult
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
``
But
I
am
afraid
*NL*
you
are
chaffing
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
,
sir
,
''
remarked
Mrs.
Miller
very
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
,
then
,
let
me
give
you
a
row
,
''
he
said
to
the
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
quite
lovely
,
the
way
you
say
that
!
''
cried
Daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
still
more
lovely
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
would
be
lovely
!
''
said
Daisy
.
But
she
made
no
movement
to
*NL*
accompany
him
;
she
only
stood
there
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
you
had
better
find
out
what
time
it
is
,
''
interposed
her
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
eleven
o'clock
,
madam
,
''
said
a
voice
,
with
a
foreign
accent
,
out
*NL*
of
the
neighboring
darkness
;
and
Winterbourne
,
turning
,
perceived
the
*NL*
florid
personage
who
was
in
attendance
upon
the
two
ladies
.
He
had
*NL*
apparently
just
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Eugenio
,
''
said
Daisy
,
``
I
am
going
out
in
a
boat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eugenio
bowed
.
``
At
eleven
o'clock
,
mademoiselle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
with
Mr.
Winterbourne
--
this
very
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
tell
her
she
ca
n't
,
''
said
Mrs.
Miller
to
the
courier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
had
better
not
go
out
in
a
boat
,
mademoiselle
,
''
Eugenio
*NL*
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
wished
to
Heaven
this
pretty
girl
were
not
so
familiar
with
*NL*
her
courier
;
but
he
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
do
n't
think
it
's
proper
!
''
Daisy
exclaimed
.
``
Eugenio
*NL*
does
n't
think
anything
's
proper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
your
service
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
mademoiselle
propose
to
go
alone
?
''
asked
Eugenio
of
Mrs.
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
with
this
gentleman
!
''
answered
Daisy
's
mamma
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
courier
looked
for
a
moment
at
Winterbourne
--
the
latter
thought
he
*NL*
was
smiling
--
and
then
,
solemnly
,
with
a
bow
,
``
As
mademoiselle
pleases
!
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
hoped
you
would
make
a
fuss
!
''
said
Daisy
.
``
I
do
n't
care
to
go
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
myself
shall
make
a
fuss
if
you
do
n't
go
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
I
want
--
a
little
fuss
!
''
And
the
young
girl
began
to
laugh
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Randolph
has
gone
to
bed
!
''
the
courier
announced
frigidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Daisy
;
now
we
can
go
!
''
said
Mrs.
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
turned
away
from
Winterbourne
,
looking
at
him
,
smiling
and
fanning
*NL*
herself
.
``
Good
night
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
hope
you
are
disappointed
,
or
*NL*
disgusted
,
or
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
,
taking
the
hand
she
offered
him
.
``
I
am
puzzled
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
it
wo
n't
keep
you
awake
!
''
she
said
very
smartly
;
and
,
*NL*
under
the
escort
of
the
privileged
Eugenio
,
the
two
ladies
passed
toward
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
stood
looking
after
them
;
he
was
indeed
puzzled
.
He
*NL*
lingered
beside
the
lake
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
turning
over
the
*NL*
mystery
of
the
young
girl
's
sudden
familiarities
and
caprices
.
But
*NL*
the
only
very
definite
conclusion
he
came
to
was
that
he
should
enjoy
*NL*
deucedly
``
going
off
''
with
her
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
afterward
he
went
off
with
her
to
the
Castle
of
Chillon
.
He
*NL*
waited
for
her
in
the
large
hall
of
the
hotel
,
where
the
couriers
,
the
*NL*
servants
,
the
foreign
tourists
,
were
lounging
about
and
staring
.
It
was
*NL*
not
the
place
he
should
have
chosen
,
but
she
had
appointed
it
.
She
came
*NL*
tripping
downstairs
,
buttoning
her
long
gloves
,
squeezing
her
folded
*NL*
parasol
against
her
pretty
figure
,
dressed
in
the
perfection
of
a
*NL*
soberly
elegant
traveling
costume
.
Winterbourne
was
a
man
of
imagination
*NL*
and
,
as
our
ancestors
used
to
say
,
sensibility
;
as
he
looked
at
her
*NL*
dress
and
,
on
the
great
staircase
,
her
little
rapid
,
confiding
step
,
he
*NL*
felt
as
if
there
were
something
romantic
going
forward
.
He
could
have
*NL*
believed
he
was
going
to
elope
with
her
.
He
passed
out
with
her
among
*NL*
all
the
idle
people
that
were
assembled
there
;
they
were
all
looking
*NL*
at
her
very
hard
;
she
had
begun
to
chatter
as
soon
as
she
joined
him
.
*NL*
Winterbourne
's
preference
had
been
that
they
should
be
conveyed
to
*NL*
Chillon
in
a
carriage
;
but
she
expressed
a
lively
wish
to
go
in
the
*NL*
little
steamer
;
she
declared
that
she
had
a
passion
for
steamboats
.
*NL*
There
was
always
such
a
lovely
breeze
upon
the
water
,
and
you
saw
such
*NL*
lots
of
people
.
The
sail
was
not
long
,
but
Winterbourne
's
companion
*NL*
found
time
to
say
a
great
many
things
.
To
the
young
man
himself
their
*NL*
little
excursion
was
so
much
of
an
escapade
--
an
adventure
--
that
,
even
*NL*
allowing
for
her
habitual
sense
of
freedom
,
he
had
some
expectation
of
*NL*
seeing
her
regard
it
in
the
same
way
.
But
it
must
be
confessed
that
,
*NL*
in
this
particular
,
he
was
disappointed
.
Daisy
Miller
was
extremely
*NL*
animated
,
she
was
in
charming
spirits
;
but
she
was
apparently
not
at
all
*NL*
excited
;
she
was
not
fluttered
;
she
avoided
neither
his
eyes
nor
those
*NL*
of
anyone
else
;
she
blushed
neither
when
she
looked
at
him
nor
when
she
*NL*
felt
that
people
were
looking
at
her
.
People
continued
to
look
at
her
*NL*
a
great
deal
,
and
Winterbourne
took
much
satisfaction
in
his
pretty
*NL*
companion
's
distinguished
air
.
He
had
been
a
little
afraid
that
she
*NL*
would
talk
loud
,
laugh
overmuch
,
and
even
,
perhaps
,
desire
to
move
about
*NL*
the
boat
a
good
deal
.
But
he
quite
forgot
his
fears
;
he
sat
smiling
,
*NL*
with
his
eyes
upon
her
face
,
while
,
without
moving
from
her
place
,
she
*NL*
delivered
herself
of
a
great
number
of
original
reflections
.
It
was
the
*NL*
most
charming
garrulity
he
had
ever
heard
.
He
had
assented
to
the
idea
*NL*
that
she
was
``
common
''
;
but
was
she
so
,
after
all
,
or
was
he
simply
*NL*
getting
used
to
her
commonness
?
Her
conversation
was
chiefly
of
what
*NL*
metaphysicians
term
the
objective
cast
,
but
every
now
and
then
it
took
a
*NL*
subjective
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
EARTH
are
you
so
grave
about
?
''
she
suddenly
demanded
,
fixing
*NL*
her
agreeable
eyes
upon
Winterbourne
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
grave
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
had
an
idea
I
was
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
as
if
you
were
taking
me
to
a
funeral
.
If
that
's
a
grin
,
your
*NL*
ears
are
very
near
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
like
me
to
dance
a
hornpipe
on
the
deck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
do
,
and
I
'll
carry
round
your
hat
.
It
will
pay
the
expenses
of
our
*NL*
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
was
better
pleased
in
my
life
,
''
murmured
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
burst
into
a
little
laugh
.
``
I
like
*NL*
to
make
you
say
those
things
!
You
're
a
queer
mixture
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
castle
,
after
they
had
landed
,
the
subjective
element
decidedly
*NL*
prevailed
.
Daisy
tripped
about
the
vaulted
chambers
,
rustled
her
skirts
*NL*
in
the
corkscrew
staircases
,
flirted
back
with
a
pretty
little
cry
and
*NL*
a
shudder
from
the
edge
of
the
oubliettes
,
and
turned
a
singularly
*NL*
well-shaped
ear
to
everything
that
Winterbourne
told
her
about
the
*NL*
place
.
But
he
saw
that
she
cared
very
little
for
feudal
antiquities
and
*NL*
that
the
dusky
traditions
of
Chillon
made
but
a
slight
impression
upon
*NL*
her
.
They
had
the
good
fortune
to
have
been
able
to
walk
about
without
*NL*
other
companionship
than
that
of
the
custodian
;
and
Winterbourne
*NL*
arranged
with
this
functionary
that
they
should
not
be
hurried
--
that
*NL*
they
should
linger
and
pause
wherever
they
chose
.
The
custodian
*NL*
interpreted
the
bargain
generously
--
Winterbourne
,
on
his
side
,
had
been
*NL*
generous
--
and
ended
by
leaving
them
quite
to
themselves
.
Miss
Miller
's
*NL*
observations
were
not
remarkable
for
logical
consistency
;
for
anything
*NL*
she
wanted
to
say
she
was
sure
to
find
a
pretext
.
She
found
a
great
many
*NL*
pretexts
in
the
rugged
embrasures
of
Chillon
for
asking
Winterbourne
*NL*
sudden
questions
about
himself
--
his
family
,
his
previous
history
,
his
*NL*
tastes
,
his
habits
,
his
intentions
--
and
for
supplying
information
upon
*NL*
corresponding
points
in
her
own
personality
.
Of
her
own
tastes
,
habits
,
*NL*
and
intentions
Miss
Miller
was
prepared
to
give
the
most
definite
,
and
*NL*
indeed
the
most
favorable
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
you
know
enough
!
''
she
said
to
her
companion
,
after
he
had
*NL*
told
her
the
history
of
the
unhappy
Bonivard
.
``
I
never
saw
a
man
that
*NL*
knew
so
much
!
''
The
history
of
Bonivard
had
evidently
,
as
they
say
,
gone
*NL*
into
one
ear
and
out
of
the
other
.
But
Daisy
went
on
to
say
that
she
*NL*
wished
Winterbourne
would
travel
with
them
and
``
go
round
''
with
them
;
*NL*
they
might
know
something
,
in
that
case
.
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
come
*NL*
and
teach
Randolph
?
''
she
asked
.
Winterbourne
said
that
nothing
*NL*
could
possibly
please
him
so
much
,
but
that
he
had
unfortunately
other
*NL*
occupations
.
``
Other
occupations
?
I
do
n't
believe
it
!
''
said
Miss
Daisy
.
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
You
are
not
in
business
.
''
The
young
man
admitted
that
*NL*
he
was
not
in
business
;
but
he
had
engagements
which
,
even
within
a
day
*NL*
or
two
,
would
force
him
to
go
back
to
Geneva
.
``
Oh
,
bother
!
''
she
said
;
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
it
!
''
and
she
began
to
talk
about
something
else
.
But
a
few
*NL*
moments
later
,
when
he
was
pointing
out
to
her
the
pretty
design
of
an
*NL*
antique
fireplace
,
she
broke
out
irrelevantly
,
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
*NL*
you
are
going
back
to
Geneva
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
melancholy
fact
that
I
shall
have
to
return
to
Geneva
*NL*
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Winterbourne
,
''
said
Daisy
,
``
I
think
you
're
horrid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
say
such
dreadful
things
!
''
said
Winterbourne
--
``
just
at
the
*NL*
last
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
!
''
cried
the
young
girl
;
``
I
call
it
the
first
.
I
have
half
a
*NL*
mind
to
leave
you
here
and
go
straight
back
to
the
hotel
alone
.
''
And
*NL*
for
the
next
ten
minutes
she
did
nothing
but
call
him
horrid
.
Poor
*NL*
Winterbourne
was
fairly
bewildered
;
no
young
lady
had
as
yet
done
him
*NL*
the
honor
to
be
so
agitated
by
the
announcement
of
his
movements
.
His
*NL*
companion
,
after
this
,
ceased
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
curiosities
of
*NL*
Chillon
or
the
beauties
of
the
lake
;
she
opened
fire
upon
the
mysterious
*NL*
charmer
in
Geneva
whom
she
appeared
to
have
instantly
taken
it
for
*NL*
granted
that
he
was
hurrying
back
to
see
.
How
did
Miss
Daisy
Miller
*NL*
know
that
there
was
a
charmer
in
Geneva
?
Winterbourne
,
who
denied
the
*NL*
existence
of
such
a
person
,
was
quite
unable
to
discover
,
and
he
was
*NL*
divided
between
amazement
at
the
rapidity
of
her
induction
and
amusement
*NL*
at
the
frankness
of
her
persiflage
.
She
seemed
to
him
,
in
all
this
,
an
*NL*
extraordinary
mixture
of
innocence
and
crudity
.
``
Does
she
never
allow
*NL*
you
more
than
three
days
at
a
time
?
''
asked
Daisy
ironically
.
``
Does
n't
*NL*
she
give
you
a
vacation
in
summer
?
There
's
no
one
so
hard
worked
but
*NL*
they
can
get
leave
to
go
off
somewhere
at
this
season
.
I
suppose
,
if
you
*NL*
stay
another
day
,
she
'll
come
after
you
in
the
boat
.
Do
wait
over
*NL*
till
Friday
,
and
I
will
go
down
to
the
landing
to
see
her
arrive
!
''
*NL*
Winterbourne
began
to
think
he
had
been
wrong
to
feel
disappointed
in
*NL*
the
temper
in
which
the
young
lady
had
embarked
.
If
he
had
missed
the
*NL*
personal
accent
,
the
personal
accent
was
now
making
its
appearance
.
*NL*
It
sounded
very
distinctly
,
at
last
,
in
her
telling
him
she
would
stop
*NL*
``
teasing
''
him
if
he
would
promise
her
solemnly
to
come
down
to
Rome
in
*NL*
the
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
a
difficult
promise
to
make
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
``
My
aunt
*NL*
has
taken
an
apartment
in
Rome
for
the
winter
and
has
already
asked
me
*NL*
to
come
and
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
come
for
your
aunt
,
''
said
Daisy
;
``
I
want
you
to
*NL*
come
for
me
.
''
And
this
was
the
only
allusion
that
the
young
man
was
ever
*NL*
to
hear
her
make
to
his
invidious
kinswoman
.
He
declared
that
,
at
*NL*
any
rate
,
he
would
certainly
come
.
After
this
Daisy
stopped
teasing
.
*NL*
Winterbourne
took
a
carriage
,
and
they
drove
back
to
Vevey
in
the
dusk
;
*NL*
the
young
girl
was
very
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Winterbourne
mentioned
to
Mrs.
Costello
that
he
had
spent
*NL*
the
afternoon
at
Chillon
with
Miss
Daisy
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Americans
--
of
the
courier
?
''
asked
this
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
happily
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
``
the
courier
stayed
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
went
with
you
all
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Costello
sniffed
a
little
at
her
smelling
bottle
.
``
And
that
,
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
is
the
young
person
whom
you
wanted
me
to
know
!

PART
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
,
who
had
returned
to
Geneva
the
day
after
his
excursion
*NL*
to
Chillon
,
went
to
Rome
toward
the
end
of
January
.
His
aunt
had
been
*NL*
established
there
for
several
weeks
,
and
he
had
received
a
couple
of
*NL*
letters
from
her
.
``
Those
people
you
were
so
devoted
to
last
summer
at
*NL*
Vevey
have
turned
up
here
,
courier
and
all
,
''
she
wrote
.
``
They
seem
to
*NL*
have
made
several
acquaintances
,
but
the
courier
continues
to
be
the
*NL*
most
intime
.
The
young
lady
,
however
,
is
also
very
intimate
with
some
*NL*
third-rate
Italians
,
with
whom
she
rackets
about
in
a
way
that
makes
*NL*
much
talk
.
Bring
me
that
pretty
novel
of
Cherbuliez
's
--
Paule
Mere
--
and
*NL*
do
n't
come
later
than
the
23rd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
natural
course
of
events
,
Winterbourne
,
on
arriving
in
Rome
,
*NL*
would
presently
have
ascertained
Mrs.
Miller
's
address
at
the
American
*NL*
banker
's
and
have
gone
to
pay
his
compliments
to
Miss
Daisy
.
``
After
what
*NL*
happened
at
Vevey
,
I
think
I
may
certainly
call
upon
them
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Costello
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
,
after
what
happens
--
at
Vevey
and
everywhere
--
you
desire
to
keep
*NL*
up
the
acquaintance
,
you
are
very
welcome
.
Of
course
a
man
may
know
*NL*
everyone
.
Men
are
welcome
to
the
privilege
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
what
is
it
that
happens
--
here
,
for
instance
?
''
Winterbourne
*NL*
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
girl
goes
about
alone
with
her
foreigners
.
As
to
what
happens
*NL*
further
,
you
must
apply
elsewhere
for
information
.
She
has
picked
up
*NL*
half
a
dozen
of
the
regular
Roman
fortune
hunters
,
and
she
takes
them
*NL*
about
to
people
's
houses
.
When
she
comes
to
a
party
she
brings
with
her
*NL*
a
gentleman
with
a
good
deal
of
manner
and
a
wonderful
mustache
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
the
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
.
They
are
very
dreadful
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
meditated
a
moment
.
``
They
are
very
ignorant
--
very
innocent
*NL*
only
.
Depend
upon
it
they
are
not
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
hopelessly
vulgar
,
''
said
Mrs.
Costello
.
``
Whether
or
no
being
*NL*
hopelessly
vulgar
is
being
`
bad
'
is
a
question
for
the
metaphysicians
.
*NL*
They
are
bad
enough
to
dislike
,
at
any
rate
;
and
for
this
short
life
*NL*
that
is
quite
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
that
Daisy
Miller
was
surrounded
by
half
a
dozen
wonderful
*NL*
mustaches
checked
Winterbourne
's
impulse
to
go
straightway
to
see
her
.
*NL*
He
had
,
perhaps
,
not
definitely
flattered
himself
that
he
had
made
an
*NL*
ineffaceable
impression
upon
her
heart
,
but
he
was
annoyed
at
hearing
*NL*
of
a
state
of
affairs
so
little
in
harmony
with
an
image
that
had
lately
*NL*
flitted
in
and
out
of
his
own
meditations
;
the
image
of
a
very
pretty
*NL*
girl
looking
out
of
an
old
Roman
window
and
asking
herself
urgently
*NL*
when
Mr.
Winterbourne
would
arrive
.
If
,
however
,
he
determined
to
wait
a
*NL*
little
before
reminding
Miss
Miller
of
his
claims
to
her
consideration
,
*NL*
he
went
very
soon
to
call
upon
two
or
three
other
friends
.
One
of
these
*NL*
friends
was
an
American
lady
who
had
spent
several
winters
at
Geneva
,
*NL*
where
she
had
placed
her
children
at
school
.
She
was
a
very
accomplished
*NL*
woman
,
and
she
lived
in
the
Via
Gregoriana
.
Winterbourne
found
her
in
a
*NL*
little
crimson
drawing
room
on
a
third
floor
;
the
room
was
filled
with
*NL*
southern
sunshine
.
He
had
not
been
there
ten
minutes
when
the
servant
*NL*
came
in
,
announcing
``
Madame
Mila
!
''
This
announcement
was
presently
*NL*
followed
by
the
entrance
of
little
Randolph
Miller
,
who
stopped
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
staring
at
Winterbourne
.
An
instant
later
*NL*
his
pretty
sister
crossed
the
threshold
;
and
then
,
after
a
considerable
*NL*
interval
,
Mrs.
Miller
slowly
advanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
!
''
said
Randolph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
know
a
great
many
things
,
''
exclaimed
Winterbourne
,
taking
*NL*
him
by
the
hand
.
``
How
is
your
education
coming
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
was
exchanging
greetings
very
prettily
with
her
hostess
,
but
when
*NL*
she
heard
Winterbourne
's
voice
she
quickly
turned
her
head
.
``
Well
,
I
*NL*
declare
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
I
should
come
,
you
know
,
''
Winterbourne
rejoined
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
believe
it
,
''
said
Miss
Daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
''
laughed
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
come
to
see
me
!
''
said
Daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
arrived
only
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
that
!
''
the
young
girl
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
turned
with
a
protesting
smile
to
her
mother
,
but
this
lady
*NL*
evaded
his
glance
,
and
,
seating
herself
,
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
son
.
*NL*
``
We
've
got
a
bigger
place
than
this
,
''
said
Randolph
.
``
It
's
all
gold
on
*NL*
the
walls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Miller
turned
uneasily
in
her
chair
.
``
I
told
you
if
I
were
to
bring
*NL*
you
,
you
would
say
something
!
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
YOU
!
''
Randolph
exclaimed
.
``
I
tell
YOU
,
sir
!
''
he
added
jocosely
,
*NL*
giving
Winterbourne
a
thump
on
the
knee
.
``
It
IS
bigger
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
had
entered
upon
a
lively
conversation
with
her
hostess
;
*NL*
Winterbourne
judged
it
becoming
to
address
a
few
words
to
her
mother
.
``
I
*NL*
hope
you
have
been
well
since
we
parted
at
Vevey
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Miller
now
certainly
looked
at
him
--
at
his
chin
.
``
Not
very
well
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
got
the
dyspepsia
,
''
said
Randolph
.
``
I
've
got
it
too
.
Father
's
got
*NL*
it
.
I
've
got
it
most
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
announcement
,
instead
of
embarrassing
Mrs.
Miller
,
seemed
to
*NL*
relieve
her
.
``
I
suffer
from
the
liver
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
think
it
's
this
*NL*
climate
;
it
's
less
bracing
than
Schenectady
,
especially
in
the
winter
*NL*
season
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
know
we
reside
at
Schenectady
.
I
was
*NL*
saying
to
Daisy
that
I
certainly
had
n't
found
any
one
like
Dr.
Davis
,
*NL*
and
I
did
n't
believe
I
should
.
Oh
,
at
Schenectady
he
stands
first
;
they
*NL*
think
everything
of
him
.
He
has
so
much
to
do
,
and
yet
there
was
nothing
*NL*
he
would
n't
do
for
me
.
He
said
he
never
saw
anything
like
my
dyspepsia
,
*NL*
but
he
was
bound
to
cure
it
.
I
'm
sure
there
was
nothing
he
would
n't
*NL*
try
.
He
was
just
going
to
try
something
new
when
we
came
off
.
Mr.
Miller
*NL*
wanted
Daisy
to
see
Europe
for
herself
.
But
I
wrote
to
Mr.
Miller
that
*NL*
it
seems
as
if
I
could
n't
get
on
without
Dr.
Davis
.
At
Schenectady
he
*NL*
stands
at
the
very
top
;
and
there
's
a
great
deal
of
sickness
there
,
too
.
*NL*
It
affects
my
sleep

''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
had
a
good
deal
of
pathological
gossip
with
Dr.
Davis
's
*NL*
patient
,
during
which
Daisy
chattered
unremittingly
to
her
own
*NL*
companion
.
The
young
man
asked
Mrs.
Miller
how
she
was
pleased
with
*NL*
Rome
.
``
Well
,
I
must
say
I
am
disappointed
,
''
she
answered
.
``
We
had
heard
*NL*
so
much
about
it
;
I
suppose
we
had
heard
too
much
.
But
we
could
n't
help
*NL*
that
.
We
had
been
led
to
expect
something
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
wait
a
little
,
and
you
will
become
very
fond
of
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
it
worse
and
worse
every
day
!
''
cried
Randolph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
like
the
infant
Hannibal
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ai
n't
!
''
Randolph
declared
at
a
venture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
much
like
an
infant
,
''
said
his
mother
.
``
But
we
have
seen
*NL*
places
,
''
she
resumed
,
``
that
I
should
put
a
long
way
before
Rome
.
''
And
in
*NL*
reply
to
Winterbourne
's
interrogation
,
``
There
's
Zurich
,
''
she
concluded
,
*NL*
``
I
think
Zurich
is
lovely
;
and
we
had
n't
heard
half
so
much
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
place
we
've
seen
is
the
City
of
Richmond
!
''
said
Randolph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
means
the
ship
,
''
his
mother
explained
.
``
We
crossed
in
that
ship
.
*NL*
Randolph
had
a
good
time
on
the
City
of
Richmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
best
place
I
've
seen
,
''
the
child
repeated
.
``
Only
it
was
turned
*NL*
the
wrong
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
've
got
to
turn
the
right
way
some
time
,
''
said
Mrs.
Miller
with
*NL*
a
little
laugh
.
Winterbourne
expressed
the
hope
that
her
daughter
at
*NL*
least
found
some
gratification
in
Rome
,
and
she
declared
that
Daisy
*NL*
was
quite
carried
away
.
``
It
's
on
account
of
the
society
--
the
society
's
*NL*
splendid
.
She
goes
round
everywhere
;
she
has
made
a
great
number
of
*NL*
acquaintances
.
Of
course
she
goes
round
more
than
I
do
.
I
must
say
they
*NL*
have
been
very
sociable
;
they
have
taken
her
right
in
.
And
then
she
*NL*
knows
a
great
many
gentlemen
.
Oh
,
she
thinks
there
's
nothing
like
Rome
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
it
's
a
great
deal
pleasanter
for
a
young
lady
if
she
knows
*NL*
plenty
of
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Daisy
had
turned
her
attention
again
to
Winterbourne
.
``
I
've
*NL*
been
telling
Mrs.
Walker
how
mean
you
were
!
''
the
young
girl
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
the
evidence
you
have
offered
?
''
asked
Winterbourne
,
rather
*NL*
annoyed
at
Miss
Miller
's
want
of
appreciation
of
the
zeal
of
an
admirer
*NL*
who
on
his
way
down
to
Rome
had
stopped
neither
at
Bologna
nor
at
*NL*
Florence
,
simply
because
of
a
certain
sentimental
impatience
.
He
*NL*
remembered
that
a
cynical
compatriot
had
once
told
him
that
American
*NL*
women
--
the
pretty
ones
,
and
this
gave
a
largeness
to
the
axiom
--
were
at
*NL*
once
the
most
exacting
in
the
world
and
the
least
endowed
with
a
sense
*NL*
of
indebtedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
were
awfully
mean
at
Vevey
,
''
said
Daisy
.
``
You
would
n't
do
*NL*
anything
.
You
would
n't
stay
there
when
I
asked
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
young
lady
,
''
cried
Winterbourne
,
with
eloquence
,
``
have
I
*NL*
come
all
the
way
to
Rome
to
encounter
your
reproaches
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
hear
him
say
that
!
''
said
Daisy
to
her
hostess
,
giving
a
twist
to
a
*NL*
bow
on
this
lady
's
dress
.
``
Did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
quaint
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
quaint
,
my
dear
?
''
murmured
Mrs.
Walker
in
the
tone
of
a
partisan
of
*NL*
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Daisy
,
fingering
Mrs.
Walker
's
ribbons
.
``
Mrs.
*NL*
Walker
,
I
want
to
tell
you
something

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother-r

interposed
Randolph
,
with
his
rough
ends
to
his
words
,
``
I
*NL*
tell
you
you
've
got
to
go

Eugenio
'll
raise
--
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of

said
Daisy
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
``
Look
*NL*
here
,
Mrs.
Walker
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
you
know
I
'm
coming
to
your
party

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
delighted
to
hear
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
lovely

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sure
of
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
want
to
ask
a
favor

permission
to
bring
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
happy
to
see
any
of
your

''
said
Mrs.
Walker
,
turning
*NL*
with
a
smile
to
Mrs.
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
are
not
my
friends
,
''
answered
Daisy
's
mamma
,
smiling
shyly
in
*NL*
her
own
fashion
.
``
I
never
spoke
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
--
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
''
said
Daisy
without
*NL*
a
tremor
in
her
clear
little
voice
or
a
shadow
on
her
brilliant
little
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Walker
was
silent
a
moment
;
she
gave
a
rapid
glance
at
*NL*
Winterbourne
.
``
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
''
she
then
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
Italian
,
''
Daisy
pursued
with
the
prettiest
serenity
.
``
He
's
a
*NL*
great
friend
of
mine
;
he
's
the
handsomest
man
in
the
world
--
except
Mr.
*NL*
Winterbourne
!
He
knows
plenty
of
Italians
,
but
he
wants
to
know
some
*NL*
Americans
.
He
thinks
ever
so
much
of
Americans
.
He
's
tremendously
*NL*
clever
.
He
's
perfectly
lovely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
settled
that
this
brilliant
personage
should
be
brought
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Walker
's
party
,
and
then
Mrs.
Miller
prepared
to
take
her
leave
.
``
I
*NL*
guess
we
'll
go
back
to
the
hotel
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
go
back
to
the
hotel
,
Mother
,
but
I
'm
going
to
take
a
walk
,
''
*NL*
said
Daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
going
to
walk
with
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
''
Randolph
proclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
the
Pincio
,
''
said
Daisy
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
,
my
dear
--
at
this
hour
?
''
Mrs.
Walker
asked
.
The
afternoon
was
*NL*
drawing
to
a
close
--
it
was
the
hour
for
the
throng
of
carriages
and
of
*NL*
contemplative
pedestrians
.
``
I
do
n't
think
it
's
safe
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Walker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
do
I
,
''
subjoined
Mrs.
Miller
.
``
You
'll
get
the
fever
,
as
sure
as
*NL*
you
live

Remember
what
Dr.
Davis
told
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
her
some
medicine
before
she
goes
,
''
said
Randolph
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
had
risen
to
its
feet
;
Daisy
,
still
showing
her
pretty
*NL*
teeth
,
bent
over
and
kissed
her
hostess
.
``
Mrs.
Walker
,
you
are
too
*NL*
perfect
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'm
not
going
alone
;
I
am
going
to
meet
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
friend
wo
n't
keep
you
from
getting
the
fever

''
Mrs.
Miller
*NL*
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Mr.
Giovanelli
?
''
asked
the
hostess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
was
watching
the
young
girl
;
at
this
question
his
attention
*NL*
quickened
.
She
stood
there
,
smiling
and
smoothing
her
bonnet
ribbons
;
*NL*
she
glanced
at
Winterbourne
.
Then
,
while
she
glanced
and
smiled
,
she
*NL*
answered
,
without
a
shade
of
hesitation
,
``
Mr.
Giovanelli
--
the
beautiful
*NL*
Giovanelli
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
young
friend
,
''
said
Mrs.
Walker
,
taking
her
hand
pleadingly
,
*NL*
``
do
n't
walk
off
to
the
Pincio
at
this
hour
to
meet
a
beautiful
Italian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
speaks
English
,
''
said
Mrs.
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
me
!
''
Daisy
exclaimed
,
``
I
do
n't
to
do
anything
improper
.
*NL*
There
's
an
easy
way
to
settle
it
.
''
She
continued
to
glance
at
*NL*
Winterbourne
.
``
The
Pincio
is
only
a
hundred
yards
distant
;
and
if
Mr.
*NL*
Winterbourne
were
as
polite
as
he
pretends
,
he
would
offer
to
walk
with
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
's
politeness
hastened
to
affirm
itself
,
and
the
young
girl
*NL*
gave
him
gracious
leave
to
accompany
her
.
They
passed
downstairs
*NL*
before
her
mother
,
and
at
the
door
Winterbourne
perceived
Mrs.
Miller
's
*NL*
carriage
drawn
up
,
with
the
ornamental
courier
whose
acquaintance
he
had
*NL*
made
at
Vevey
seated
within
.
``
Goodbye
,
Eugenio
!
''
cried
Daisy
;
``
I
'm
going
*NL*
to
take
a
walk
.
''
The
distance
from
the
Via
Gregoriana
to
the
beautiful
*NL*
garden
at
the
other
end
of
the
Pincian
Hill
is
,
in
fact
,
rapidly
*NL*
traversed
.
As
the
day
was
splendid
,
however
,
and
the
concourse
of
*NL*
vehicles
,
walkers
,
and
loungers
numerous
,
the
young
Americans
found
*NL*
their
progress
much
delayed
.
This
fact
was
highly
agreeable
to
*NL*
Winterbourne
,
in
spite
of
his
consciousness
of
his
singular
situation
.
*NL*
The
slow-moving
,
idly
gazing
Roman
crowd
bestowed
much
attention
upon
*NL*
the
extremely
pretty
young
foreign
lady
who
was
passing
through
it
upon
*NL*
his
arm
;
and
he
wondered
what
on
earth
had
been
in
Daisy
's
mind
when
*NL*
she
proposed
to
expose
herself
,
unattended
,
to
its
appreciation
.
His
own
*NL*
mission
,
to
her
sense
,
apparently
,
was
to
consign
her
to
the
hands
*NL*
of
Mr.
Giovanelli
;
but
Winterbourne
,
at
once
annoyed
and
gratified
,
*NL*
resolved
that
he
would
do
no
such
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
n't
you
been
to
see
me
?
''
asked
Daisy
.
``
You
ca
n't
get
out
of
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
that
I
have
only
just
stepped
out
*NL*
of
the
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
stayed
in
the
train
a
good
while
after
it
stopped
!
''
cried
*NL*
the
young
girl
with
her
little
laugh
.
``
I
suppose
you
were
asleep
.
You
*NL*
have
had
time
to
go
to
see
Mrs.
Walker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
Mrs.
Walker
--
''
Winterbourne
began
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
where
you
knew
her
.
You
knew
her
at
Geneva
.
She
told
me
so
.
*NL*
Well
,
you
knew
me
at
Vevey
.
That
's
just
as
good
.
So
you
ought
to
have
*NL*
come
.
''
She
asked
him
no
other
question
than
this
;
she
began
to
prattle
*NL*
about
her
own
affairs
.
``
We
've
got
splendid
rooms
at
the
hotel
;
Eugenio
*NL*
says
they
're
the
best
rooms
in
Rome
.
We
are
going
to
stay
all
winter
,
*NL*
if
we
do
n't
die
of
the
fever
;
and
I
guess
we
'll
stay
then
.
It
's
a
great
*NL*
deal
nicer
than
I
thought
;
I
thought
it
would
be
fearfully
quiet
;
I
was
*NL*
sure
it
would
be
awfully
poky
.
I
was
sure
we
should
be
going
round
*NL*
all
the
time
with
one
of
those
dreadful
old
men
that
explain
about
the
*NL*
pictures
and
things
.
But
we
only
had
about
a
week
of
that
,
and
now
*NL*
I
'm
enjoying
myself
.
I
know
ever
so
many
people
,
and
they
are
all
so
*NL*
charming
.
The
society
's
extremely
select
.
There
are
all
kinds
--
English
,
*NL*
and
Germans
,
and
Italians
.
I
think
I
like
the
English
best
.
I
like
their
*NL*
style
of
conversation
.
But
there
are
some
lovely
Americans
.
I
never
saw
*NL*
anything
so
hospitable
.
There
's
something
or
other
every
day
.
There
's
*NL*
not
much
dancing
;
but
I
must
say
I
never
thought
dancing
was
everything
.
*NL*
I
was
always
fond
of
conversation
.
I
guess
I
shall
have
plenty
at
Mrs.
*NL*
Walker
's
,
her
rooms
are
so
small
.
''
When
they
had
passed
the
gate
of
the
*NL*
Pincian
Gardens
,
Miss
Miller
began
to
wonder
where
Mr.
Giovanelli
might
*NL*
be
.
``
We
had
better
go
straight
to
that
place
in
front
,
''
she
said
,
``
where
*NL*
you
look
at
the
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
shall
not
help
you
to
find
him
,
''
Winterbourne
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
shall
find
him
without
you
,
''
cried
Miss
Daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
certainly
wo
n't
leave
me
!
''
cried
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
burst
into
her
little
laugh
.
``
Are
you
afraid
you
'll
get
lost
--
or
run
*NL*
over
?
But
there
's
Giovanelli
,
leaning
against
that
tree
.
He
's
staring
at
*NL*
the
women
in
the
carriages
:
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
cool
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
perceived
at
some
distance
a
little
man
standing
with
*NL*
folded
arms
nursing
his
cane
.
He
had
a
handsome
face
,
an
artfully
poised
*NL*
hat
,
a
glass
in
one
eye
,
and
a
nosegay
in
his
buttonhole
.
Winterbourne
*NL*
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
said
,
``
Do
you
mean
to
speak
to
that
*NL*
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
mean

speak
to
him

Why

signs

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
understand
,
then
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
``
that
I
intend
to
remain
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
stopped
and
looked
at
him
,
without
a
sign
of
troubled
*NL*
consciousness
in
her
face
,
with
nothing
but
the
presence
of
her
charming
*NL*
eyes
and
her
happy
dimples
.
``
Well
,
she
's
a
cool
one
!
''
thought
the
young
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
the
way
you
say
that
,
''
said
Daisy
.
``
It
's
too
imperious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
if
I
say
it
wrong
.
The
main
point
is
to
give
you
an
*NL*
idea
of
my
meaning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
looked
at
him
more
gravely
,
but
with
eyes
that
were
*NL*
prettier
than
ever
.
``
I
have
never
allowed
a
gentleman
to
dictate
to
me
,
*NL*
or
to
interfere
with
anything
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
have
made
a
mistake
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
``
You
should
*NL*
sometimes
listen
to
a
gentleman
--
the
right
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
began
to
laugh
again
.
``
I
do
nothing
but
listen
to
gentlemen
!
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
.
``
Tell
me
if
Mr.
Giovanelli
is
the
right
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
with
the
nosegay
in
his
bosom
had
now
perceived
our
two
*NL*
friends
,
and
was
approaching
the
young
girl
with
obsequious
rapidity
.
*NL*
He
bowed
to
Winterbourne
as
well
as
to
the
latter
's
companion
;
he
had
*NL*
a
brilliant
smile
,
an
intelligent
eye
;
Winterbourne
thought
him
not
a
*NL*
bad-looking
fellow
.
But
he
nevertheless
said
to
Daisy
,
``
No
,
he
's
not
the
*NL*
right
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
evidently
had
a
natural
talent
for
performing
introductions
;
she
*NL*
mentioned
the
name
of
each
of
her
companions
to
the
other
.
She
strolled
*NL*
alone
with
one
of
them
on
each
side
of
her
;
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
who
spoke
*NL*
English
very
cleverly
--
Winterbourne
afterward
learned
that
he
had
*NL*
practiced
the
idiom
upon
a
great
many
American
heiresses
--
addressed
her
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
very
polite
nonsense
;
he
was
extremely
urbane
,
and
the
*NL*
young
American
,
who
said
nothing
,
reflected
upon
that
profundity
of
*NL*
Italian
cleverness
which
enables
people
to
appear
more
gracious
in
*NL*
proportion
as
they
are
more
acutely
disappointed
.
Giovanelli
,
of
course
,
*NL*
had
counted
upon
something
more
intimate
;
he
had
not
bargained
for
*NL*
a
party
of
three
.
But
he
kept
his
temper
in
a
manner
which
suggested
*NL*
far-stretching
intentions
.
Winterbourne
flattered
himself
that
he
had
*NL*
taken
his
measure
.
``
He
is
not
a
gentleman
,
''
said
the
young
American
;
*NL*
``
he
is
only
a
clever
imitation
of
one
.
He
is
a
music
master
,
or
a
*NL*
penny-a-liner
,
or
a
third-rate
artist
.
D
__
n
his
good
looks
!
''
Mr.
*NL*
Giovanelli
had
certainly
a
very
pretty
face
;
but
Winterbourne
felt
a
*NL*
superior
indignation
at
his
own
lovely
fellow
countrywoman
's
not
knowing
*NL*
the
difference
between
a
spurious
gentleman
and
a
real
one
.
Giovanelli
*NL*
chattered
and
jested
and
made
himself
wonderfully
agreeable
.
It
was
*NL*
true
that
,
if
he
was
an
imitation
,
the
imitation
was
brilliant
.
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
Winterbourne
said
to
himself
,
``
a
nice
girl
ought
to
*NL*
know
!
''
And
then
he
came
back
to
the
question
whether
this
was
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
a
nice
girl
.
Would
a
nice
girl
,
even
allowing
for
her
being
a
little
*NL*
American
flirt
,
make
a
rendezvous
with
a
presumably
low-lived
foreigner
?
*NL*
The
rendezvous
in
this
case
,
indeed
,
had
been
in
broad
daylight
and
in
*NL*
the
most
crowded
corner
of
Rome
,
but
was
it
not
impossible
to
regard
the
*NL*
choice
of
these
circumstances
as
a
proof
of
extreme
cynicism
?
Singular
*NL*
though
it
may
seem
,
Winterbourne
was
vexed
that
the
young
girl
,
in
*NL*
joining
her
amoroso
,
should
not
appear
more
impatient
of
his
own
*NL*
company
,
and
he
was
vexed
because
of
his
inclination
.
It
was
impossible
*NL*
to
regard
her
as
a
perfectly
well-conducted
young
lady
;
she
was
wanting
*NL*
in
a
certain
indispensable
delicacy
.
It
would
therefore
simplify
matters
*NL*
greatly
to
be
able
to
treat
her
as
the
object
of
one
of
those
sentiments
*NL*
which
are
called
by
romancers
``
lawless
passions
.
''
That
she
should
seem
*NL*
to
wish
to
get
rid
of
him
would
help
him
to
think
more
lightly
of
her
,
*NL*
and
to
be
able
to
think
more
lightly
of
her
would
make
her
much
less
*NL*
perplexing
.
But
Daisy
,
on
this
occasion
,
continued
to
present
herself
as
*NL*
an
inscrutable
combination
of
audacity
and
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
walking
some
quarter
of
an
hour
,
attended
by
her
two
*NL*
cavaliers
,
and
responding
in
a
tone
of
very
childish
gaiety
,
as
it
*NL*
seemed
to
Winterbourne
,
to
the
pretty
speeches
of
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
when
*NL*
a
carriage
that
had
detached
itself
from
the
revolving
train
drew
up
*NL*
beside
the
path
.
At
the
same
moment
Winterbourne
perceived
that
his
*NL*
friend
Mrs.
Walker
--
the
lady
whose
house
he
had
lately
left
--
was
seated
*NL*
in
the
vehicle
and
was
beckoning
to
him
.
Leaving
Miss
Miller
's
side
,
*NL*
he
hastened
to
obey
her
summons
.
Mrs.
Walker
was
flushed
;
she
wore
an
*NL*
excited
air
.
``
It
is
really
too
dreadful
,
''
she
said
.
``
That
girl
must
not
*NL*
do
this
sort
of
thing
.
She
must
not
walk
here
with
you
two
men
.
Fifty
*NL*
people
have
noticed
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
raised
his
eyebrows
.
``
I
think
it
's
a
pity
to
make
too
much
*NL*
fuss
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
to
let
the
girl
ruin
herself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
innocent
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
very
crazy
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Walker
.
``
Did
you
ever
see
anything
so
*NL*
imbecile
as
her
mother
?
After
you
had
all
left
me
just
now
,
I
could
not
*NL*
sit
still
for
thinking
of
it
.
It
seemed
too
pitiful
,
not
even
to
attempt
*NL*
to
save
her
.
I
ordered
the
carriage
and
put
on
my
bonnet
,
and
came
here
*NL*
as
quickly
as
possible
.
Thank
Heaven
I
have
found
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
propose
to
do
with
us
?
''
asked
Winterbourne
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
ask
her
to
get
in
,
to
drive
her
about
here
for
half
an
hour
,
so
that
*NL*
the
world
may
see
she
is
not
running
absolutely
wild
,
and
then
to
take
*NL*
her
safely
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
's
a
very
happy
thought
,
''
said
Winterbourne
;
``
but
you
*NL*
can
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Walker
tried
.
The
young
man
went
in
pursuit
of
Miss
Miller
,
who
*NL*
had
simply
nodded
and
smiled
at
his
interlocutor
in
the
carriage
and
*NL*
had
gone
her
way
with
her
companion
.
Daisy
,
on
learning
that
Mrs.
Walker
*NL*
wished
to
speak
to
her
,
retraced
her
steps
with
a
perfect
good
grace
and
*NL*
with
Mr.
Giovanelli
at
her
side
.
She
declared
that
she
was
delighted
to
*NL*
have
a
chance
to
present
this
gentleman
to
Mrs.
Walker
.
She
immediately
*NL*
achieved
the
introduction
,
and
declared
that
she
had
never
in
her
life
*NL*
seen
anything
so
lovely
as
Mrs.
Walker
's
carriage
rug
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
admire
it
,
''
said
this
lady
,
smiling
sweetly
.
``
Will
you
*NL*
get
in
and
let
me
put
it
over
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Daisy
.
``
I
shall
admire
it
much
more
as
I
see
*NL*
you
driving
round
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
get
in
and
drive
with
me
!
''
said
Mrs.
Walker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
charming
,
but
it
's
so
enchanting
just
as
I
am
!
''
and
Daisy
*NL*
gave
a
brilliant
glance
at
the
gentlemen
on
either
side
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
enchanting
,
dear
child
,
but
it
is
not
the
custom
here
,
''
urged
*NL*
Mrs.
Walker
,
leaning
forward
in
her
victoria
,
with
her
hands
devoutly
*NL*
clasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
ought
to
be
,
then
!
''
said
Daisy
.
``
If
I
did
n't
walk
I
should
*NL*
expire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
walk
with
your
mother
,
dear
,
''
cried
the
lady
from
Geneva
,
*NL*
losing
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
my
mother
dear
!
''
exclaimed
the
young
girl
.
Winterbourne
saw
that
*NL*
she
scented
interference
.
``
My
mother
never
walked
ten
steps
in
her
life
.
*NL*
And
then
,
you
know
,
''
she
added
with
a
laugh
,
``
I
am
more
than
five
years
*NL*
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
old
enough
to
be
more
reasonable
.
You
are
old
enough
,
dear
Miss
*NL*
Miller
,
to
be
talked
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
looked
at
Mrs.
Walker
,
smiling
intensely
.
``
Talked
about
?
What
do
*NL*
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
into
my
carriage
,
and
I
will
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
turned
her
quickened
glance
again
from
one
of
the
gentlemen
beside
*NL*
her
to
the
other
.
Mr.
Giovanelli
was
bowing
to
and
fro
,
rubbing
down
*NL*
his
gloves
and
laughing
very
agreeably
;
Winterbourne
thought
it
a
most
*NL*
unpleasant
scene
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
want
to
know
what
you
mean
,
''
said
*NL*
Daisy
presently
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
should
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
wished
that
Mrs.
Walker
would
tuck
in
her
carriage
rug
and
*NL*
drive
away
,
but
this
lady
did
not
enjoy
being
defied
,
as
she
afterward
*NL*
told
him
.
``
Should
you
prefer
being
thought
a
very
reckless
girl
?
''
she
*NL*
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
!
''
exclaimed
Daisy
.
She
looked
again
at
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
then
*NL*
she
turned
to
Winterbourne
.
There
was
a
little
pink
flush
in
her
cheek
;
*NL*
she
was
tremendously
pretty
.
``
Does
Mr.
Winterbourne
think
,
''
she
asked
*NL*
slowly
,
smiling
,
throwing
back
her
head
,
and
glancing
at
him
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
,
``
that
,
to
save
my
reputation
,
I
ought
to
get
into
the
*NL*
carriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
colored
;
for
an
instant
he
hesitated
greatly
.
It
seemed
so
*NL*
strange
to
hear
her
speak
that
way
of
her
``
reputation
.
''
But
he
himself
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
must
speak
in
accordance
with
gallantry
.
The
finest
gallantry
,
*NL*
here
,
was
simply
to
tell
her
the
truth
;
and
the
truth
,
for
Winterbourne
,
*NL*
as
the
few
indications
I
have
been
able
to
give
have
made
him
known
to
*NL*
the
reader
,
was
that
Daisy
Miller
should
take
Mrs.
Walker
's
advice
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
her
exquisite
prettiness
,
and
then
he
said
,
very
gently
,
``
I
*NL*
think
you
should
get
into
the
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
gave
a
violent
laugh
.
``
I
never
heard
anything
so
stiff
!
If
this
*NL*
is
improper
,
Mrs.
Walker
,
''
she
pursued
,
``
then
I
am
all
improper
,
and
you
*NL*
must
give
me
up
.
Goodbye
;
I
hope
you
'll
have
a
lovely
ride
!
''
and
,
with
*NL*
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
who
made
a
triumphantly
obsequious
salute
,
she
turned
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Walker
sat
looking
after
her
,
and
there
were
tears
in
Mrs.
Walker
's
*NL*
eyes
.
``
Get
in
here
,
sir
,
''
she
said
to
Winterbourne
,
indicating
the
place
*NL*
beside
her
.
The
young
man
answered
that
he
felt
bound
to
accompany
Miss
*NL*
Miller
,
whereupon
Mrs.
Walker
declared
that
if
he
refused
her
this
*NL*
favor
she
would
never
speak
to
him
again
.
She
was
evidently
in
earnest
.
*NL*
Winterbourne
overtook
Daisy
and
her
companion
,
and
,
offering
the
young
*NL*
girl
his
hand
,
told
her
that
Mrs.
Walker
had
made
an
imperious
claim
*NL*
upon
his
society
.
He
expected
that
in
answer
she
would
say
something
*NL*
rather
free
,
something
to
commit
herself
still
further
to
that
*NL*
``
recklessness
''
from
which
Mrs.
Walker
had
so
charitably
endeavored
to
*NL*
dissuade
her
.
But
she
only
shook
his
hand
,
hardly
looking
at
him
,
while
*NL*
Mr.
Giovanelli
bade
him
farewell
with
a
too
emphatic
flourish
of
the
*NL*
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
was
not
in
the
best
possible
humor
as
he
took
his
seat
in
*NL*
Mrs.
Walker
's
victoria
.
``
That
was
not
clever
of
you
,
''
he
said
candidly
,
*NL*
while
the
vehicle
mingled
again
with
the
throng
of
carriages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
such
a
case
,
''
his
companion
answered
,
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
clever
;
I
*NL*
wish
to
be
EARNEST
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
your
earnestness
has
only
offended
her
and
put
her
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
happened
very
well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Walker
.
``
If
she
is
so
perfectly
*NL*
determined
to
compromise
herself
,
the
sooner
one
knows
it
the
better
;
*NL*
one
can
act
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
she
meant
no
harm
,
''
Winterbourne
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
thought
a
month
ago
.
But
she
has
been
going
too
far

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
she
been
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
that
is
not
done
here

Flirting
with
any
man
she
could
pick
*NL*
up

sitting
in
corners
with
mysterious
Italians
;
dancing
all
the
evening
*NL*
with
the
same
partners

receiving
visits
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night

goes
away

come

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

said
Winterbourne

He

told

at

talking
about

and
that
a
smile
goes
round

and
asks
for
Miss

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Winterbourne
angrily
.
``
The
poor
girl

*NL*
only
fault

he
presently
added
,
``
is
that
she
is
very
uncultivated

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
naturally
indelicate

Mrs.
Walker
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
that
example
this
morning

How
long
had
you
known
her
at
Vevey

``
A
couple
of
days

*NL*
``
Fancy

her
making
it
a
personal
matter

you
should
have
left
*NL*
the
place

''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
was
silent
for
some
moments
;
then
he
said
,
``
I
suspect
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Walker
,
that
you
and
I
have
lived
too
long
at
Geneva
!

And
he
added
a
*NL*
request
that
she
should
inform
him
with
what
particular
design
she
had
*NL*
made
him
enter
her
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
to
beg
you
to
cease
your
relations

Miss
Miller

not

flirt
with

give
her
no
further
opportunity

expose
herself

*NL*
let

in
short
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I

said
Winterbourne
.
``
I
like

extremely

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
certainly
will
be
in
the

she
takes
them

But
I
have
said
what
*NL*
I
had
on
my
conscience
,
''
Mrs.
Walker
pursued
.
``
If
you
wish
to
rejoin
the
*NL*
young

I
will
put
you
down

Here

by

*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
was
traversing
that
part
of
the
Pincian
Garden
that
*NL*
overhangs
the
wall
of
Rome
and
overlooks
the
beautiful
Villa
Borghese
.
*NL*
It
is
bordered
by
a
large
parapet
,
near
which
there
are
several
seats
.
*NL*
One
of
the
seats
at
a
distance
was
occupied
by
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
,
*NL*
toward
whom
Mrs.
Walker
gave
a
toss
of
her
head
.
At
the
same
moment
*NL*
these
persons
rose
and
walked
toward
the
parapet
.
Winterbourne
had
asked
*NL*
the
coachman
to
stop
;
he
now
descended
from
the
carriage
.
His
companion
*NL*
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
;
then
,
while
he
raised
his
hat
,
she
*NL*
drove
majestically
away
.
Winterbourne
stood
there
;
he
had
turned
his
*NL*
eyes
toward
Daisy
and
her
cavalier
.
They
evidently
saw
no
one
;
they
were
*NL*
too
deeply
occupied
with
each
other
.
When
they
reached
the
low
garden
*NL*
wall
,
they
stood
a
moment
looking
off
at
the
great
flat-topped
pine
*NL*
clusters
of
the
Villa
Borghese
;
then
Giovanelli
seated
himself
,
*NL*
familiarly
,
upon
the
broad
ledge
of
the
wall
.
The
western
sun
in
the
*NL*
opposite
sky
sent
out
a
brilliant
shaft
through
a
couple
of
cloud
bars
,
*NL*
whereupon
Daisy
's
companion
took
her
parasol
out
of
her
hands
and
opened
*NL*
it
.
She
came
a
little
nearer
,
and
he
held
the
parasol
over
her
;
then
,
*NL*
still
holding
it
,
he
let
it
rest
upon
her
shoulder
,
so
that
both
of
*NL*
their
heads
were
hidden
from
Winterbourne
.
This
young
man
lingered
a
*NL*
moment
,
then
he
began
to
walk
.
But
he
walked
--
not
toward
the
couple
with
*NL*
the
parasol
;
toward
the
residence
of
his
aunt
,
Mrs.
Costello
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
flattered
himself
on
the
following
day
that
there
was
no
smiling
*NL*
among
the
servants
when
he
,
at
least
,
asked
for
Mrs.
Miller
at
her
*NL*
hotel
.
This
lady
and
her
daughter
,
however
,
were
not
at
home
;
and
on
*NL*
the
next
day
after
,
repeating
his
visit
,
Winterbourne
again
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
not
to
find
them
.
Mrs.
Walker
's
party
took
place
on
the
*NL*
evening
of
the
third
day
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
frigidity
of
his
last
*NL*
interview
with
the
hostess
,
Winterbourne
was
among
the
guests
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Walker
was
one
of
those
American
ladies
who
,
while
residing
abroad
,
make
*NL*
a
point
,
in
their
own
phrase
,
of
studying
European
society
,
and
she
*NL*
had
on
this
occasion
collected
several
specimens
of
her
diversely
born
*NL*
fellow
mortals
to
serve
,
as
it
were
,
as
textbooks
.
When
Winterbourne
*NL*
arrived
,
Daisy
Miller
was
not
there
,
but
in
a
few
moments
he
saw
her
*NL*
mother
come
in
alone
,
very
shyly
and
ruefully
.
Mrs.
Miller
's
hair
*NL*
above
her
exposed-looking
temples
was
more
frizzled
than
ever
.
As
she
*NL*
approached
Mrs.
Walker
,
Winterbourne
also
drew
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
've
come
all
alone
,
''
said
poor
Mrs.
Miller
.
``
I
'm
so
*NL*
frightened
;
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
It
's
the
first
time
I
've
ever
been
*NL*
to
a
party
alone
,
especially
in
this
country
.
I
wanted
to
bring
Randolph
*NL*
or
Eugenio
,
or
someone
,
but
Daisy
just
pushed
me
off
by
myself
.
I
ai
n't
*NL*
used
to
going
round
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
does
not
your
daughter
intend
to
favor
us
with
her
society
?
''
*NL*
demanded
Mrs.
Walker
impressively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Daisy
's
all
dressed
,
''
said
Mrs.
Miller
with
that
accent
of
the
*NL*
dispassionate
,
if
not
of
the
philosophic
,
historian
with
which
she
*NL*
always
recorded
the
current
incidents
of
her
daughter
's
career
.
``
She
got
*NL*
dressed
on
purpose
before
dinner
.
But
she
's
got
a
friend
of
hers
there
;
*NL*
that
gentleman
--
the
Italian
--
that
she
wanted
to
bring
.
They
've
got
going
*NL*
at
the
piano
;
it
seems
as
if
they
could
n't
leave
off
.
Mr.
Giovanelli
*NL*
sings
splendidly
.
But
I
guess
they
'll
come
before
very
long
,
''
concluded
*NL*
Mrs.
Miller
hopefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
she
should
come
in
that
way
,
''
said
Mrs.
Walker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
told
her
that
there
was
no
use
in
her
getting
dressed
before
*NL*
dinner
if
she
was
going
to
wait
three
hours
,
''
responded
Daisy
's
mamma
.
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
see
the
use
of
her
putting
on
such
a
dress
as
that
to
sit
*NL*
round
with
Mr.
Giovanelli
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
most
horrible
!
''
said
Mrs.
Walker
,
turning
away
and
addressing
*NL*
herself
to
Winterbourne
.
``
Elle
s
`
affiche
.
It
's
her
revenge
for
my
having
*NL*
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
her
.
When
she
comes
,
I
shall
not
speak
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
came
after
eleven
o'clock
;
but
she
was
not
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
*NL*
a
young
lady
to
wait
to
be
spoken
to
.
She
rustled
forward
in
radiant
*NL*
loveliness
,
smiling
and
chattering
,
carrying
a
large
bouquet
,
and
*NL*
attended
by
Mr.
Giovanelli
.
Everyone
stopped
talking
and
turned
and
*NL*
looked
at
her
.
She
came
straight
to
Mrs.
Walker
.
``
I
'm
afraid
you
thought
*NL*
I
never
was
coming
,
so
I
sent
mother
off
to
tell
you
.
I
wanted
to
make
*NL*
Mr.
Giovanelli
practice
some
things
before
he
came
;
you
know
he
sings
*NL*
beautifully
,
and
I
want
you
to
ask
him
to
sing
.
This
is
Mr.
Giovanelli
;
*NL*
you
know
I
introduced
him
to
you
;
he
's
got
the
most
lovely
voice
,
and
*NL*
he
knows
the
most
charming
set
of
songs
.
I
made
him
go
over
them
this
*NL*
evening
on
purpose
;
we
had
the
greatest
time
at
the
hotel
.
''
Of
all
*NL*
this
Daisy
delivered
herself
with
the
sweetest
,
brightest
audibleness
,
*NL*
looking
now
at
her
hostess
and
now
round
the
room
,
while
she
gave
a
*NL*
series
of
little
pats
,
round
her
shoulders
,
to
the
edges
of
her
dress
.
*NL*
``
Is
there
anyone
I
know
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
every
one
knows
you
!
''
said
Mrs.
Walker
pregnantly
,
and
she
gave
*NL*
a
very
cursory
greeting
to
Mr.
Giovanelli
.
This
gentleman
bore
himself
*NL*
gallantly
.
He
smiled
and
bowed
and
showed
his
white
teeth
;
he
curled
his
*NL*
mustaches
and
rolled
his
eyes
and
performed
all
the
proper
functions
*NL*
of
a
handsome
Italian
at
an
evening
party
.
He
sang
very
prettily
half
*NL*
a
dozen
songs
,
though
Mrs.
Walker
afterward
declared
that
she
had
been
*NL*
quite
unable
to
find
out
who
asked
him
.
It
was
apparently
not
Daisy
who
*NL*
had
given
him
his
orders
.
Daisy
sat
at
a
distance
from
the
piano
,
and
*NL*
though
she
had
publicly
,
as
it
were
,
professed
a
high
admiration
for
his
*NL*
singing
,
talked
,
not
inaudibly
,
while
it
was
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
these
rooms
are
so
small
;
we
ca
n't
dance
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
Winterbourne
,
as
if
she
had
seen
him
five
minutes
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sorry
we
ca
n't
dance
,
''
Winterbourne
answered
;
``
I
do
n't
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
do
n't
dance
;
you
're
too
stiff
,
''
said
Miss
Daisy
.
``
I
hope
*NL*
you
enjoyed
your
drive
with
Mrs.
Walker
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
did
n't
enjoy
it
;
I
preferred
walking
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
paired
off
:
that
was
much
better
,
''
said
Daisy
.
``
But
did
you
ever
*NL*
hear
anything
so
cool
as
Mrs.
Walker
's
wanting
me
to
get
into
her
*NL*
carriage
and
drop
poor
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
and
under
the
pretext
that
it
was
*NL*
proper
?
People
have
different
ideas
!
It
would
have
been
most
unkind
;
he
*NL*
had
been
talking
about
that
walk
for
ten
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
should
not
have
talked
about
it
at
all
,
''
said
Winterbourne
;
``
he
*NL*
would
never
have
proposed
to
a
young
lady
of
this
country
to
walk
about
*NL*
the
streets
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
the
streets
?
''
cried
Daisy
with
her
pretty
stare
.
``
Where
,
then
,
*NL*
would
he
have
proposed
to
her
to
walk
?
The
Pincio
is
not
the
streets
,
*NL*
either
;
and
I
,
thank
goodness
,
am
not
a
young
lady
of
this
country
.
The
*NL*
young
ladies
of
this
country
have
a
dreadfully
poky
time
of
it
,
so
far
*NL*
as
I
can
learn
;
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
change
my
habits
for
THEM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
your
habits
are
those
of
a
flirt

''
said
Winterbourne
*NL*
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
they
are
,
''
she
cried
,
giving
him
her
little
smiling
stare
*NL*
again
.
``
I
'm
a
fearful
,
frightful
flirt
!
Did
you
ever
hear
of
a
nice
girl
*NL*
that
was
not
?
But
I
suppose
you
will
tell
me
now
that
I
am
not
a
nice
*NL*
girl
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
very
nice
girl

I
wish
you
would
flirt

said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

thank
you

thank
you
very
much

you
are
the
last
man
I
should
think
*NL*
of
flirting
with
.
As
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
informing
you
,
you
are
*NL*
too
stiff

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
that
too
often

said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
gave
a
delighted
laugh
.
``
If
I
could
have
the
sweet
hope
of
making
*NL*
you
angry
,
I
should
say
it
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
do
that
;
when
I
am
angry
I
'm
stiffer
than
ever

But
if
you
wo
n't
*NL*
flirt
with
me
,
do
cease
,
at
least
,
to
flirt
with
your
friend
at
the
*NL*
piano
;
they
do
n't
understand
that
sort
of
thing
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
they
understood
nothing
else

''
exclaimed
Daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
young
unmarried
women

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
much
more
proper
in
young
unmarried
women

in
old

married
ones

Daisy
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Winterbourne
,
``
when
you
deal
with
natives
you
must
go

Flirting

American
custom
;
*NL*
it
does

exist
here

So
when

show
yourself
in
public
with
Mr.

without
your
mother

*NL*
``
He
is

said
Daisy
with
vivacity

``
And
if
you

want
very
much

*NL*
``
Ah

rejoined
Winterbourne
,
``
if
you

*NL*
another
affair

*NL*
*NL*
She
had
allowed
him
up
to
this
point
to
talk
so
frankly
that
he
had
no
*NL*
expectation
of
shocking
her
by
this
ejaculation
;
but
she
immediately
got
*NL*
up
,
blushing
visibly
,
and
leaving
him
to
exclaim
mentally
that
*NL*
little
American
flirts
were
the
queerest
creatures
in
the
world

``
Mr.
*NL*
Giovanelli

she
said
,
giving
her
interlocutor
a
single
*NL*
glance
,
``
never

me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
was
bewildered
;
he
stood
,
staring
.
Mr.
Giovanelli
had
*NL*
finished
singing
.
He
left
the
piano
and
came
over
to
Daisy
.
``
Wo
n't
you
*NL*
come
into
the
other
room
and
have
some
tea
?
''
he
asked
,
bending
before
*NL*
her
with
his
ornamental
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
turned
to
Winterbourne
,
beginning
to
smile
again
.
He
was
still
*NL*
more
perplexed
,
for
this
inconsequent
smile
made
nothing
clear
,
though
*NL*
it
seemed
to
prove
,
indeed
,
that
she
had
a
sweetness
and
softness
that
*NL*
reverted
instinctively
to
the
pardon
of
offenses
.
``
It
has
never
occurred
*NL*
to
Mr.
Winterbourne
to
offer
me
any
tea
,
''
she
said
with
her
little
*NL*
tormenting
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
offered
you
advice
,
''
Winterbourne
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
prefer
weak
tea
!
''
cried
Daisy
,
and
she
went
off
with
the
brilliant
*NL*
Giovanelli
.
She
sat
with
him
in
the
adjoining
room
,
in
the
embrasure
*NL*
of
the
window
,
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
There
was
an
interesting
*NL*
performance
at
the
piano
,
but
neither
of
these
young
people
gave
heed
*NL*
to
it
.
When
Daisy
came
to
take
leave
of
Mrs.
Walker
,
this
lady
*NL*
conscientiously
repaired
the
weakness
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
at
*NL*
the
moment
of
the
young
girl
's
arrival
.
She
turned
her
back
straight
*NL*
upon
Miss
Miller
and
left
her
to
depart
with
what
grace
she
might
.
*NL*
Winterbourne
was
standing
near
the
door
;
he
saw
it
all
.
Daisy
turned
*NL*
very
pale
and
looked
at
her
mother
,
but
Mrs.
Miller
was
humbly
*NL*
unconscious
of
any
violation
of
the
usual
social
forms
.
She
appeared
,
*NL*
indeed
,
to
have
felt
an
incongruous
impulse
to
draw
attention
to
her
own
*NL*
striking
observance
of
them
.
``
Good
night
,
Mrs.
Walker
,
''
she
said
;
``
we
've
*NL*
had
a
beautiful
evening
.
You
see
,
if
I
let
Daisy
come
to
parties
without
*NL*
me
,
I
do
n't
want
her
to
go
away
without
me
.
''
Daisy
turned
away
,
looking
*NL*
with
a
pale
,
grave
face
at
the
circle
near
the
door
;
Winterbourne
saw
*NL*
that
,
for
the
first
moment
,
she
was
too
much
shocked
and
puzzled
even
*NL*
for
indignation
.
He
on
his
side
was
greatly
touched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
very
cruel
,
''
he
said
to
Mrs.
Walker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
enters
my
drawing
room
again
!
''
replied
his
hostess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Winterbourne
was
not
to
meet
her
in
Mrs.
Walker
's
drawing
room
,
he
*NL*
went
as
often
as
possible
to
Mrs.
Miller
's
hotel
.
The
ladies
were
rarely
*NL*
at
home
,
but
when
he
found
them
,
the
devoted
Giovanelli
was
always
*NL*
present
.
Very
often
the
brilliant
little
Roman
was
in
the
drawing
room
*NL*
with
Daisy
alone
,
Mrs.
Miller
being
apparently
constantly
of
the
opinion
*NL*
that
discretion
is
the
better
part
of
surveillance
.
Winterbourne
*NL*
noted
,
at
first
with
surprise
,
that
Daisy
on
these
occasions
was
never
*NL*
embarrassed
or
annoyed
by
his
own
entrance
;
but
he
very
presently
began
*NL*
to
feel
that
she
had
no
more
surprises
for
him
;
the
unexpected
in
her
*NL*
behavior
was
the
only
thing
to
expect
.
She
showed
no
displeasure
at
*NL*
her
tete-a-tete
with
Giovanelli
being
interrupted
;
she
could
chatter
as
*NL*
freshly
and
freely
with
two
gentlemen
as
with
one
;
there
was
always
,
*NL*
in
her
conversation
,
the
same
odd
mixture
of
audacity
and
puerility
.
*NL*
Winterbourne
remarked
to
himself
that
if
she
was
seriously
interested
in
*NL*
Giovanelli
,
it
was
very
singular
that
she
should
not
take
more
trouble
*NL*
to
preserve
the
sanctity
of
their
interviews
;
and
he
liked
her
the
more
*NL*
for
her
innocent-looking
indifference
and
her
apparently
inexhaustible
*NL*
good
humor
.
He
could
hardly
have
said
why
,
but
she
seemed
to
him
a
girl
*NL*
who
would
never
be
jealous
.
At
the
risk
of
exciting
a
somewhat
derisive
*NL*
smile
on
the
reader
's
part
,
I
may
affirm
that
with
regard
to
the
women
*NL*
who
had
hitherto
interested
him
,
it
very
often
seemed
to
Winterbourne
*NL*
among
the
possibilities
that
,
given
certain
contingencies
,
he
should
be
*NL*
afraid
--
literally
afraid
--
of
these
ladies
;
he
had
a
pleasant
sense
that
*NL*
he
should
never
be
afraid
of
Daisy
Miller
.
It
must
be
added
that
this
*NL*
sentiment
was
not
altogether
flattering
to
Daisy
;
it
was
part
of
his
*NL*
conviction
,
or
rather
of
his
apprehension
,
that
she
would
prove
a
very
*NL*
light
young
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
evidently
very
much
interested
in
Giovanelli
.
She
looked
at
*NL*
him
whenever
he
spoke
;
she
was
perpetually
telling
him
to
do
this
and
*NL*
to
do
that
;
she
was
constantly
``
chaffing
''
and
abusing
him
.
She
appeared
*NL*
completely
to
have
forgotten
that
Winterbourne
had
said
anything
to
*NL*
displease
her
at
Mrs.
Walker
's
little
party
.
One
Sunday
afternoon
,
*NL*
having
gone
to
St.
Peter
's
with
his
aunt
,
Winterbourne
perceived
*NL*
Daisy
strolling
about
the
great
church
in
company
with
the
inevitable
*NL*
Giovanelli
.
Presently
he
pointed
out
the
young
girl
and
her
cavalier
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Costello
.
This
lady
looked
at
them
a
moment
through
her
eyeglass
,
*NL*
and
then
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
makes
you
so
pensive
in
these
days
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
the
least
idea
I
was
pensive
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
much
preoccupied
;
you
are
thinking
of
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
it
,
''
he
asked
,
``
that
you
accuse
me
of
thinking
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
that
young
lady
's
--
Miss
Baker
's
,
Miss
Chandler
's
--
what
's
her
*NL*
name
?
--
Miss
Miller
's
intrigue
with
that
little
barber
's
block
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
it
an
intrigue
,
''
Winterbourne
asked
--
``
an
affair
that
goes
*NL*
on
with
such
peculiar
publicity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
their
folly
,
''
said
Mrs.
Costello
;
``
it
's
not
their
merit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
rejoined
Winterbourne
,
with
something
of
that
pensiveness
to
which
*NL*
his
aunt
had
alluded
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
that
there
is
anything
to
be
*NL*
called
an
intrigue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
a
dozen
people
speak
of
it
;
they
say
she
is
quite
carried
*NL*
away
by
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
certainly
very
intimate
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Costello
inspected
the
young
couple
again
with
her
optical
*NL*
instrument
.
``
He
is
very
handsome
.
One
easily
sees
how
it
is
.
She
thinks
*NL*
him
the
most
elegant
man
in
the
world
,
the
finest
gentleman
.
She
has
*NL*
never
seen
anything
like
him
;
he
is
better
,
even
,
than
the
courier
.
*NL*
It
was
the
courier
probably
who
introduced
him
;
and
if
he
succeeds
in
*NL*
marrying
the
young
lady
,
the
courier
will
come
in
for
a
magnificent
*NL*
commission
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
she
thinks
of
marrying
him
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
``
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
he
hopes
to
marry
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
very
sure
she
thinks
of
nothing
.
She
goes
on
from
day
to
*NL*
day
,
from
hour
to
hour
,
as
they
did
in
the
Golden
Age
.
I
can
imagine
*NL*
nothing
more
vulgar
.
And
at
the
same
time
,
''
added
Mrs.
Costello
,
``
depend
*NL*
upon
it
that
she
may
tell
you
any
moment
that
she
is
`
engaged
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
is
more
than
Giovanelli
expects
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
Giovanelli
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
Italian
.
I
have
asked
questions
about
him
and
learned
*NL*
something
.
He
is
apparently
a
perfectly
respectable
little
man
.
I
*NL*
believe
he
is
,
in
a
small
way
,
a
cavaliere
avvocato
.
But
he
does
n't
*NL*
move
in
what
are
called
the
first
circles
.
I
think
it
is
really
not
*NL*
absolutely
impossible
that
the
courier
introduced
him
.
He
is
evidently
*NL*
immensely
charmed
with
Miss
Miller
.
If
she
thinks
him
the
finest
*NL*
gentleman
in
the
world
,
he
,
on
his
side
,
has
never
found
himself
in
*NL*
personal
contact
with
such
splendor
,
such
opulence
,
such
expensiveness
*NL*
as
this
young
lady
's
.
And
then
she
must
seem
to
him
wonderfully
pretty
*NL*
and
interesting
.
I
rather
doubt
that
he
dreams
of
marrying
her
.
That
*NL*
must
appear
to
him
too
impossible
a
piece
of
luck
.
He
has
nothing
but
*NL*
his
handsome
face
to
offer
,
and
there
is
a
substantial
Mr.
Miller
in
*NL*
that
mysterious
land
of
dollars
.
Giovanelli
knows
that
he
has
n't
a
title
*NL*
to
offer
.
If
he
were
only
a
count
or
a
marchese
!
He
must
wonder
at
his
*NL*
luck
,
at
the
way
they
have
taken
him
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
accounts
for
it
by
his
handsome
face
and
thinks
Miss
Miller
a
young
*NL*
lady
qui
se
passe
ses
fantaisies
!
''
said
Mrs.
Costello
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
true
,
''
Winterbourne
pursued
,
``
that
Daisy
and
her
mamma
have
*NL*
not
yet
risen
to
that
stage
of
--
what
shall
I
call
it
?
--
of
culture
at
*NL*
which
the
idea
of
catching
a
count
or
a
marchese
begins
.
I
believe
that
*NL*
they
are
intellectually
incapable
of
that
conception
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
but
the
avvocato
ca
n't
believe
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Costello
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
observation
excited
by
Daisy
's
``
intrigue
,
''
Winterbourne
gathered
*NL*
that
day
at
St.
Peter
's
sufficient
evidence
.
A
dozen
of
the
American
*NL*
colonists
in
Rome
came
to
talk
with
Mrs.
Costello
,
who
sat
on
a
little
*NL*
portable
stool
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
great
pilasters
.
The
vesper
*NL*
service
was
going
forward
in
splendid
chants
and
organ
tones
in
the
*NL*
adjacent
choir
,
and
meanwhile
,
between
Mrs.
Costello
and
her
friends
,
*NL*
there
was
a
great
deal
said
about
poor
little
Miss
Miller
's
going
really
*NL*
``
too
far
.
''
Winterbourne
was
not
pleased
with
what
he
heard
,
but
when
,
*NL*
coming
out
upon
the
great
steps
of
the
church
,
he
saw
Daisy
,
who
had
*NL*
emerged
before
him
,
get
into
an
open
cab
with
her
accomplice
and
roll
*NL*
away
through
the
cynical
streets
of
Rome
,
he
could
not
deny
to
himself
*NL*
that
she
was
going
very
far
indeed
.
He
felt
very
sorry
for
her
--
not
*NL*
exactly
that
he
believed
that
she
had
completely
lost
her
head
,
but
*NL*
because
it
was
painful
to
hear
so
much
that
was
pretty
,
and
undefended
,
*NL*
and
natural
assigned
to
a
vulgar
place
among
the
categories
of
disorder
.
*NL*
He
made
an
attempt
after
this
to
give
a
hint
to
Mrs.
Miller
.
He
met
one
*NL*
day
in
the
Corso
a
friend
,
a
tourist
like
himself
,
who
had
just
come
*NL*
out
of
the
Doria
Palace
,
where
he
had
been
walking
through
the
beautiful
*NL*
gallery
.
His
friend
talked
for
a
moment
about
the
superb
portrait
*NL*
of
Innocent
X
by
Velasquez
which
hangs
in
one
of
the
cabinets
of
the
*NL*
palace
,
and
then
said
,
``
And
in
the
same
cabinet
,
by
the
way
,
I
had
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
contemplating
a
picture
of
a
different
kind
--
that
pretty
*NL*
American
girl
whom
you
pointed
out
to
me
last
week
.
''
In
answer
to
*NL*
Winterbourne
's
inquiries
,
his
friend
narrated
that
the
pretty
American
*NL*
girl
--
prettier
than
ever
--
was
seated
with
a
companion
in
the
secluded
*NL*
nook
in
which
the
great
papal
portrait
was
enshrined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
her
companion
?
''
asked
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
Italian
with
a
bouquet
in
his
buttonhole
.
The
girl
is
*NL*
delightfully
pretty
,
but
I
thought
I
understood
from
you
the
other
day
*NL*
that
she
was
a
young
lady
du
meilleur
monde
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
is
!
''
answered
Winterbourne
;
and
having
assured
himself
that
his
*NL*
informant
had
seen
Daisy
and
her
companion
but
five
minutes
before
,
he
*NL*
jumped
into
a
cab
and
went
to
call
on
Mrs.
Miller
.
She
was
at
home
;
but
*NL*
she
apologized
to
him
for
receiving
him
in
Daisy
's
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
gone
out
somewhere
with
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
''
said
Mrs.
Miller
.
``
She
's
*NL*
always
going
round
with
Mr.
Giovanelli
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
noticed
that
they
are
very
intimate
,
''
Winterbourne
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
seems
as
if
they
could
n't
live
without
each
other
!
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Miller
.
``
Well
,
he
's
a
real
gentleman
,
anyhow
.
I
keep
telling
Daisy
she
's
*NL*
engaged
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
Daisy
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
says
she
is
n't
engaged
.
But
she
might
as
well
be
!
''
this
*NL*
impartial
parent
resumed
;
``
she
goes
on
as
if
she
was
.
But
I
've
made
Mr.
*NL*
Giovanelli
promise
to
tell
me
,
if
SHE
does
n't
.
I
should
want
to
write
to
*NL*
Mr.
Miller
about
it
--
should
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
replied
that
he
certainly
should
;
and
the
state
of
mind
of
*NL*
Daisy
's
mamma
struck
him
as
so
unprecedented
in
the
annals
of
parental
*NL*
vigilance
that
he
gave
up
as
utterly
irrelevant
the
attempt
to
place
her
*NL*
upon
her
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
Daisy
was
never
at
home
,
and
Winterbourne
ceased
to
meet
her
*NL*
at
the
houses
of
their
common
acquaintances
,
because
,
as
he
perceived
,
*NL*
these
shrewd
people
had
quite
made
up
their
minds
that
she
was
going
too
*NL*
far
.
They
ceased
to
invite
her
;
and
they
intimated
that
they
desired
to
*NL*
express
to
observant
Europeans
the
great
truth
that
,
though
Miss
*NL*
Daisy
Miller
was
a
young
American
lady
,
her
behavior
was
not
*NL*
representative
--
was
regarded
by
her
compatriots
as
abnormal
.
*NL*
Winterbourne
wondered
how
she
felt
about
all
the
cold
shoulders
that
*NL*
were
turned
toward
her
,
and
sometimes
it
annoyed
him
to
suspect
that
*NL*
she
did
not
feel
at
all
.
He
said
to
himself
that
she
was
too
light
and
*NL*
childish
,
too
uncultivated
and
unreasoning
,
too
provincial
,
to
have
*NL*
reflected
upon
her
ostracism
,
or
even
to
have
perceived
it
.
Then
at
*NL*
other
moments
he
believed
that
she
carried
about
in
her
elegant
and
*NL*
irresponsible
little
organism
a
defiant
,
passionate
,
perfectly
observant
*NL*
consciousness
of
the
impression
she
produced
.
He
asked
himself
whether
*NL*
Daisy
's
defiance
came
from
the
consciousness
of
innocence
,
or
from
her
*NL*
being
,
essentially
,
a
young
person
of
the
reckless
class
.
It
must
be
*NL*
admitted
that
holding
one
's
self
to
a
belief
in
Daisy
's
``
innocence
''
came
*NL*
to
seem
to
Winterbourne
more
and
more
a
matter
of
fine-spun
gallantry
.
*NL*
As
I
have
already
had
occasion
to
relate
,
he
was
angry
at
finding
*NL*
himself
reduced
to
chopping
logic
about
this
young
lady
;
he
was
vexed
at
*NL*
his
want
of
instinctive
certitude
as
to
how
far
her
eccentricities
were
*NL*
generic
,
national
,
and
how
far
they
were
personal
.
From
either
view
*NL*
of
them
he
had
somehow
missed
her
,
and
now
it
was
too
late
.
She
was
*NL*
``
carried
away
''
by
Mr.
Giovanelli
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
after
his
brief
interview
with
her
mother
,
he
encountered
her
*NL*
in
that
beautiful
abode
of
flowering
desolation
known
as
the
Palace
of
*NL*
the
Caesars
.
The
early
Roman
spring
had
filled
the
air
with
bloom
and
*NL*
perfume
,
and
the
rugged
surface
of
the
Palatine
was
muffled
with
tender
*NL*
verdure
.
Daisy
was
strolling
along
the
top
of
one
of
those
great
mounds
*NL*
of
ruin
that
are
embanked
with
mossy
marble
and
paved
with
monumental
*NL*
inscriptions
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
Rome
had
never
been
so
lovely
as
*NL*
just
then
.
He
stood
,
looking
off
at
the
enchanting
harmony
of
line
and
*NL*
color
that
remotely
encircles
the
city
,
inhaling
the
softly
humid
odors
,
*NL*
and
feeling
the
freshness
of
the
year
and
the
antiquity
of
the
place
*NL*
reaffirm
themselves
in
mysterious
interfusion
.
It
seemed
to
him
also
*NL*
that
Daisy
had
never
looked
so
pretty
,
but
this
had
been
an
observation
*NL*
of
his
whenever
he
met
her
.
Giovanelli
was
at
her
side
,
and
Giovanelli
,
*NL*
too
,
wore
an
aspect
of
even
unwonted
brilliancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Daisy
,
``
I
should
think
you
would
be
lonesome
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lonesome
?
''
asked
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
going
round
by
yourself
.
Ca
n't
you
get
anyone
to
walk
*NL*
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
so
fortunate
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
``
as
your
companion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Giovanelli
,
from
the
first
,
had
treated
Winterbourne
with
distinguished
*NL*
politeness
.
He
listened
with
a
deferential
air
to
his
remarks
;
he
*NL*
laughed
punctiliously
at
his
pleasantries
;
he
seemed
disposed
to
testify
*NL*
to
his
belief
that
Winterbourne
was
a
superior
young
man
.
He
carried
*NL*
himself
in
no
degree
like
a
jealous
wooer
;
he
had
obviously
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
tact
;
he
had
no
objection
to
your
expecting
a
little
humility
of
him
.
*NL*
It
even
seemed
to
Winterbourne
at
times
that
Giovanelli
would
find
a
*NL*
certain
mental
relief
in
being
able
to
have
a
private
understanding
with
*NL*
him
--
to
say
to
him
,
as
an
intelligent
man
,
that
,
bless
you
,
HE
knew
*NL*
how
extraordinary
was
this
young
lady
,
and
did
n't
flatter
himself
with
*NL*
delusive
--
or
at
least
TOO
delusive
--
hopes
of
matrimony
and
dollars
.
On
*NL*
this
occasion
he
strolled
away
from
his
companion
to
pluck
a
sprig
of
*NL*
almond
blossom
,
which
he
carefully
arranged
in
his
buttonhole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
why
you
say
that
,
''
said
Daisy
,
watching
Giovanelli
.
``
Because
you
*NL*
think
I
go
round
too
much
with
HIM
.
''
And
she
nodded
at
her
attendant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
one
thinks
so
--
if
you
care
to
know
,
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
care
to
know
!
''
Daisy
exclaimed
seriously
.
``
But
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
it
.
They
are
only
pretending
to
be
shocked
.
They
do
n't
really
*NL*
care
a
straw
what
I
do
.
Besides
,
I
do
n't
go
round
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
will
find
they
do
care
.
They
will
show
it
disagreeably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
``
How
disagreeably
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
noticed
anything
?
''
Winterbourne
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
noticed
you
.
But
I
noticed
you
were
as
stiff
as
an
umbrella
the
*NL*
first
time
I
saw
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
find
I
am
not
so
stiff
as
several
others
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
shall
I
find
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
going
to
see
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
they
do
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
give
you
the
cold
shoulder
.
Do
you
know
what
that
means
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
was
looking
at
him
intently
;
she
began
to
color
.
``
Do
you
mean
as
*NL*
Mrs.
Walker
did
the
other
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
!
''
said
Winterbourne
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
away
at
Giovanelli
,
who
was
decorating
himself
with
his
*NL*
almond
blossom
.
Then
looking
back
at
Winterbourne
,
``
I
should
n't
think
*NL*
you
would
let
people
be
so
unkind
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
help
it
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
you
would
say
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
say
something
;
''
and
he
paused
a
moment
.
``
I
say
that
your
mother
*NL*
tells
me
that
she
believes
you
are
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
does
,
''
said
Daisy
very
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
began
to
laugh
.
``
And
does
Randolph
believe
it
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
Randolph
does
n't
believe
anything
,
''
said
Daisy
.
Randolph
's
*NL*
skepticism
excited
Winterbourne
to
further
hilarity
,
and
he
observed
*NL*
that
Giovanelli
was
coming
back
to
them
.
Daisy
,
observing
it
too
,
*NL*
addressed
herself
again
to
her
countryman
.
``
Since
you
have
mentioned
*NL*
it
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
AM
engaged
.
''
*
*
*
Winterbourne
looked
at
her
;
he
had
*NL*
stopped
laughing
.
``
You
do
n't
believe
!
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
a
moment
;
and
then
,
``
Yes
,
I
believe
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
you
do
n't
!
''
she
answered
.
``
Well
,
then
--
I
am
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
and
her
cicerone
were
on
their
way
to
the
gate
of
the
*NL*
enclosure
,
so
that
Winterbourne
,
who
had
but
lately
entered
,
presently
*NL*
took
leave
of
them
.
A
week
afterward
he
went
to
dine
at
a
beautiful
*NL*
villa
on
the
Caelian
Hill
,
and
,
on
arriving
,
dismissed
his
hired
*NL*
vehicle
.
The
evening
was
charming
,
and
he
promised
himself
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
walking
home
beneath
the
Arch
of
Constantine
and
past
*NL*
the
vaguely
lighted
monuments
of
the
Forum
.
There
was
a
waning
moon
in
*NL*
the
sky
,
and
her
radiance
was
not
brilliant
,
but
she
was
veiled
in
a
*NL*
thin
cloud
curtain
which
seemed
to
diffuse
and
equalize
it
.
When
,
on
his
*NL*
return
from
the
villa
-LRB-
it
was
eleven
o'clock
-RRB-
,
Winterbourne
approached
*NL*
the
dusky
circle
of
the
Colosseum
,
it
recurred
to
him
,
as
a
lover
of
*NL*
the
picturesque
,
that
the
interior
,
in
the
pale
moonshine
,
would
be
well
*NL*
worth
a
glance
.
He
turned
aside
and
walked
to
one
of
the
empty
arches
,
*NL*
near
which
,
as
he
observed
,
an
open
carriage
--
one
of
the
little
Roman
*NL*
streetcabs
--
was
stationed
.
Then
he
passed
in
,
among
the
cavernous
*NL*
shadows
of
the
great
structure
,
and
emerged
upon
the
clear
and
silent
*NL*
arena
.
The
place
had
never
seemed
to
him
more
impressive
.
One-half
of
*NL*
the
gigantic
circus
was
in
deep
shade
,
the
other
was
sleeping
in
the
*NL*
luminous
dusk
.
As
he
stood
there
he
began
to
murmur
Byron
's
famous
*NL*
lines
,
out
of
``
Manfred
,
''
but
before
he
had
finished
his
quotation
*NL*
he
remembered
that
if
nocturnal
meditations
in
the
Colosseum
are
*NL*
recommended
by
the
poets
,
they
are
deprecated
by
the
doctors
.
The
*NL*
historic
atmosphere
was
there
,
certainly
;
but
the
historic
atmosphere
,
*NL*
scientifically
considered
,
was
no
better
than
a
villainous
miasma
.
*NL*
Winterbourne
walked
to
the
middle
of
the
arena
,
to
take
a
more
general
*NL*
glance
,
intending
thereafter
to
make
a
hasty
retreat
.
The
great
cross
in
*NL*
the
center
was
covered
with
shadow
;
it
was
only
as
he
drew
near
it
that
*NL*
he
made
it
out
distinctly
.
Then
he
saw
that
two
persons
were
stationed
*NL*
upon
the
low
steps
which
formed
its
base
.
One
of
these
was
a
woman
,
*NL*
seated
;
her
companion
was
standing
in
front
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
sound
of
the
woman
's
voice
came
to
him
distinctly
in
the
*NL*
warm
night
air
.
``
Well
,
he
looks
at
us
as
one
of
the
old
lions
or
tigers
*NL*
may
have
looked
at
the
Christian
martyrs
!
''
These
were
the
words
he
*NL*
heard
,
in
the
familiar
accent
of
Miss
Daisy
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
hope
he
is
not
very
hungry
,
''
responded
the
ingenious
Giovanelli
.
*NL*
``
He
will
have
to
take
me
first
;
you
will
serve
for
dessert
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
stopped
,
with
a
sort
of
horror
,
and
,
it
must
be
added
,
with
*NL*
a
sort
of
relief
.
It
was
as
if
a
sudden
illumination
had
been
flashed
*NL*
upon
the
ambiguity
of
Daisy
's
behavior
,
and
the
riddle
had
become
easy
*NL*
to
read
.
She
was
a
young
lady
whom
a
gentleman
need
no
longer
be
*NL*
at
pains
to
respect
.
He
stood
there
,
looking
at
her
--
looking
at
her
*NL*
companion
and
not
reflecting
that
though
he
saw
them
vaguely
,
he
himself
*NL*
must
have
been
more
brightly
visible
.
He
felt
angry
with
himself
that
he
*NL*
had
bothered
so
much
about
the
right
way
of
regarding
Miss
Daisy
Miller
.
*NL*
Then
,
as
he
was
going
to
advance
again
,
he
checked
himself
,
not
from
the
*NL*
fear
that
he
was
doing
her
injustice
,
but
from
a
sense
of
the
danger
*NL*
of
appearing
unbecomingly
exhilarated
by
this
sudden
revulsion
from
*NL*
cautious
criticism
.
He
turned
away
toward
the
entrance
of
the
place
,
*NL*
but
,
as
he
did
so
,
he
heard
Daisy
speak
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
was
Mr.
Winterbourne
!
He
saw
me
,
and
he
cuts
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
clever
little
reprobate
she
was
,
and
how
smartly
she
played
at
*NL*
injured
innocence
!
But
he
would
n't
cut
her
.
Winterbourne
came
forward
*NL*
again
and
went
toward
the
great
cross
.
Daisy
had
got
up
;
Giovanelli
*NL*
lifted
his
hat
.
Winterbourne
had
now
begun
to
think
simply
of
the
*NL*
craziness
,
from
a
sanitary
point
of
view
,
of
a
delicate
young
girl
*NL*
lounging
away
the
evening
in
this
nest
of
malaria
.
What
if
she
WERE
*NL*
a
clever
little
reprobate
?
that
was
no
reason
for
her
dying
of
the
*NL*
perniciosa
.
``
How
long
have
you
been
here
?
''
he
asked
almost
brutally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
,
lovely
in
the
flattering
moonlight
,
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
*NL*
Then
--
``
All
the
evening
,
''
she
answered
,
gently
.
*
*
*
``
I
never
saw
*NL*
anything
so
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
``
that
you
will
not
think
Roman
fever
*NL*
very
pretty
.
This
is
the
way
people
catch
it
.
I
wonder
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
turning
to
Giovanelli
,
``
that
you
,
a
native
Roman
,
should
countenance
*NL*
such
a
terrible
indiscretion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
handsome
native
,
``
for
myself
I
am
not
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
am
I
--
for
you
!
I
am
speaking
for
this
young
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Giovanelli
lifted
his
well-shaped
eyebrows
and
showed
his
brilliant
*NL*
teeth
.
But
he
took
Winterbourne
's
rebuke
with
docility
.
``
I
told
the
*NL*
signorina
it
was
a
grave
indiscretion
,
but
when
was
the
signorina
ever
*NL*
prudent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
was
sick
,
and
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
!
''
the
signorina
declared
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
look
like
much
,
but
I
'm
healthy
!
I
was
bound
to
see
the
Colosseum
*NL*
by
moonlight
;
I
should
n't
have
wanted
to
go
home
without
that
;
and
we
*NL*
have
had
the
most
beautiful
time
,
have
n't
we
,
Mr.
Giovanelli
?
If
there
*NL*
has
been
any
danger
,
Eugenio
can
give
me
some
pills
.
He
has
got
some
*NL*
splendid
pills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
advise
you
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
``
to
drive
home
as
fast
as
*NL*
possible
and
take
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
say
is
very
wise
,
''
Giovanelli
rejoined
.
``
I
will
go
and
make
*NL*
sure
the
carriage
is
at
hand
.
''
And
he
went
forward
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
followed
with
Winterbourne
.
He
kept
looking
at
her
;
she
seemed
*NL*
not
in
the
least
embarrassed
.
Winterbourne
said
nothing
;
Daisy
chattered
*NL*
about
the
beauty
of
the
place
.
``
Well
,
I
HAVE
seen
the
Colosseum
by
*NL*
moonlight
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
That
's
one
good
thing
.
''
Then
,
noticing
*NL*
Winterbourne
's
silence
,
she
asked
him
why
he
did
n't
speak
.
He
made
*NL*
no
answer
;
he
only
began
to
laugh
.
They
passed
under
one
of
the
dark
*NL*
archways
;
Giovanelli
was
in
front
with
the
carriage
.
Here
Daisy
stopped
*NL*
a
moment
,
looking
at
the
young
American
.
``
DID
you
believe
I
was
engaged
,
*NL*
the
other
day
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter
what
I
believed
the
other
day
,
''
said
Winterbourne
,
*NL*
still
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
believe
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
that
it
makes
very
little
difference
whether
you
are
engaged
*NL*
or
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
the
young
girl
's
pretty
eyes
fixed
upon
him
through
the
thick
*NL*
gloom
of
the
archway
;
she
was
apparently
going
to
answer
.
But
Giovanelli
*NL*
hurried
her
forward
.
``
Quick
!
quick
!
''
he
said
;
``
if
we
get
in
by
midnight
*NL*
we
are
quite
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
took
her
seat
in
the
carriage
,
and
the
fortunate
Italian
placed
*NL*
himself
beside
her
.
``
Do
n't
forget
Eugenio
's
pills
!
''
said
Winterbourne
as
*NL*
he
lifted
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
,
''
said
Daisy
in
a
little
strange
tone
,
``
whether
I
have
*NL*
Roman
fever
or
not
!
''
Upon
this
the
cab
driver
cracked
his
whip
,
and
they
*NL*
rolled
away
over
the
desultory
patches
of
the
antique
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
,
to
do
him
justice
,
as
it
were
,
mentioned
to
no
one
that
*NL*
he
had
encountered
Miss
Miller
,
at
midnight
,
in
the
Colosseum
with
a
*NL*
gentleman
;
but
nevertheless
,
a
couple
of
days
later
,
the
fact
of
her
*NL*
having
been
there
under
these
circumstances
was
known
to
every
member
*NL*
of
the
little
American
circle
,
and
commented
accordingly
.
Winterbourne
*NL*
reflected
that
they
had
of
course
known
it
at
the
hotel
,
and
that
,
after
*NL*
Daisy
's
return
,
there
had
been
an
exchange
of
remarks
between
the
porter
*NL*
and
the
cab
driver
.
But
the
young
man
was
conscious
,
at
the
same
moment
,
*NL*
that
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
serious
regret
to
him
that
the
*NL*
little
American
flirt
should
be
``
talked
about
''
by
low-minded
menials
.
*NL*
These
people
,
a
day
or
two
later
,
had
serious
information
to
give
:
the
*NL*
little
American
flirt
was
alarmingly
ill
.
Winterbourne
,
when
the
rumor
*NL*
came
to
him
,
immediately
went
to
the
hotel
for
more
news
.
He
found
that
*NL*
two
or
three
charitable
friends
had
preceded
him
,
and
that
they
were
*NL*
being
entertained
in
Mrs.
Miller
's
salon
by
Randolph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
going
round
at
night
,
''
said
Randolph
--
``
that
's
what
made
her
sick
.
*NL*
She
's
always
going
round
at
night
.
I
should
n't
think
she
'd
want
to
,
*NL*
it
's
so
plaguy
dark
.
You
ca
n't
see
anything
here
at
night
,
except
when
*NL*
there
's
a
moon
.
In
America
there
's
always
a
moon
!
''
Mrs.
Miller
was
*NL*
invisible
;
she
was
now
,
at
least
,
giving
her
daughter
the
advantage
of
*NL*
her
society
.
It
was
evident
that
Daisy
was
dangerously
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
went
often
to
ask
for
news
of
her
,
and
once
he
saw
Mrs.
*NL*
Miller
,
who
,
though
deeply
alarmed
,
was
,
rather
to
his
surprise
,
*NL*
perfectly
composed
,
and
,
as
it
appeared
,
a
most
efficient
and
judicious
*NL*
nurse
.
She
talked
a
good
deal
about
Dr.
Davis
,
but
Winterbourne
paid
her
*NL*
the
compliment
of
saying
to
himself
that
she
was
not
,
after
all
,
such
*NL*
a
monstrous
goose
.
``
Daisy
spoke
of
you
the
other
day
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
``
Half
the
time
she
does
n't
know
what
she
's
saying
,
but
that
time
I
think
*NL*
she
did
.
She
gave
me
a
message
she
told
me
to
tell
you
.
She
told
me
to
*NL*
tell
you
that
she
never
was
engaged
to
that
handsome
Italian
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
I
am
very
glad
;
Mr.
Giovanelli
has
n't
been
near
us
since
she
was
taken
*NL*
ill
.
I
thought
he
was
so
much
of
a
gentleman
;
but
I
do
n't
call
that
*NL*
very
polite
!
A
lady
told
me
that
he
was
afraid
I
was
angry
with
him
for
*NL*
taking
Daisy
round
at
night
.
Well
,
so
I
am
,
but
I
suppose
he
knows
I
'm
a
*NL*
lady
.
I
would
scorn
to
scold
him
.
Anyway
,
she
says
she
's
not
engaged
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
why
she
wanted
you
to
know
,
but
she
said
to
me
three
times
,
*NL*
`
Mind
you
tell
Mr.
Winterbourne
.
'
And
then
she
told
me
to
ask
if
you
*NL*
remembered
the
time
you
went
to
that
castle
in
Switzerland
.
But
I
said
*NL*
I
would
n't
give
any
such
messages
as
that
.
Only
,
if
she
is
not
engaged
,
*NL*
I
'm
sure
I
'm
glad
to
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
Winterbourne
had
said
,
it
mattered
very
little
.
A
week
after
*NL*
this
,
the
poor
girl
died
;
it
had
been
a
terrible
case
of
the
fever
.
*NL*
Daisy
's
grave
was
in
the
little
Protestant
cemetery
,
in
an
angle
of
*NL*
the
wall
of
imperial
Rome
,
beneath
the
cypresses
and
the
thick
spring
*NL*
flowers
.
Winterbourne
stood
there
beside
it
,
with
a
number
of
other
*NL*
mourners
,
a
number
larger
than
the
scandal
excited
by
the
young
lady
's
*NL*
career
would
have
led
you
to
expect
.
Near
him
stood
Giovanelli
,
who
came
*NL*
nearer
still
before
Winterbourne
turned
away
.
Giovanelli
was
very
pale
:
*NL*
on
this
occasion
he
had
no
flower
in
his
buttonhole
;
he
seemed
to
wish
*NL*
to
say
something
.
At
last
he
said
,
``
She
was
the
most
beautiful
young
*NL*
lady
I
ever
saw
,
and
the
most
amiable
;
''
and
then
he
added
in
a
moment
,
*NL*
``
and
she
was
the
most
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
looked
at
him
and
presently
repeated
his
words
,
``
And
the
*NL*
most
innocent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
most
innocent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
felt
sore
and
angry
.
``
Why
the
devil
,
''
he
asked
,
``
did
you
*NL*
take
her
to
that
fatal
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Giovanelli
's
urbanity
was
apparently
imperturbable
.
He
looked
on
the
*NL*
ground
a
moment
,
and
then
he
said
,
``
For
myself
I
had
no
fear
;
and
she
*NL*
wanted
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
no
reason
!
''
Winterbourne
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subtle
Roman
again
dropped
his
eyes
.
``
If
she
had
lived
,
I
should
*NL*
have
got
nothing
.
She
would
never
have
married
me
,
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
never
have
married
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
a
moment
I
hoped
so
.
But
no
.
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
listened
to
him
:
he
stood
staring
at
the
raw
protuberance
*NL*
among
the
April
daisies
.
When
he
turned
away
again
,
Mr.
Giovanelli
,
with
*NL*
his
light
,
slow
step
,
had
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
almost
immediately
left
Rome
;
but
the
following
summer
he
*NL*
again
met
his
aunt
,
Mrs.
Costello
at
Vevey
.
Mrs.
Costello
was
fond
of
*NL*
Vevey
.
In
the
interval
Winterbourne
had
often
thought
of
Daisy
Miller
*NL*
and
her
mystifying
manners
.
One
day
he
spoke
of
her
to
his
aunt
--
said
it
*NL*
was
on
his
conscience
that
he
had
done
her
injustice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Mrs.
Costello
.
``
How
did
your
injustice
*NL*
affect
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
sent
me
a
message
before
her
death
which
I
did
n't
understand
at
the
*NL*
time
;
but
I
have
understood
it
since
.
She
would
have
appreciated
one
's
*NL*
esteem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
a
modest
way
,
''
asked
Mrs.
Costello
,
``
of
saying
that
she
would
*NL*
have
reciprocated
one
's
affection
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Winterbourne
offered
no
answer
to
this
question
;
but
he
presently
said
,
*NL*
``
You
were
right
in
that
remark
that
you
made
last
summer
.
I
was
booked
*NL*
to
make
a
mistake
.
I
have
lived
too
long
in
foreign
parts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
went
back
to
live
at
Geneva
,
whence
there
continue
to
*NL*
come
the
most
contradictory
accounts
of
his
motives
of
sojourn
:
a
report
*NL*
that
he
is
``
studying
''
hard
--
an
intimation
that
he
is
much
interested
in
*NL*
a
very
clever
foreign
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
