A
BIOGRAPHICAL
SKETCH
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
trivial
act
of
the
daily
life
of
some
men
has
a
unique
*NL*
interest
,
independent
of
idle
curiosity
,
which
dissatisfies
us
with
the
*NL*
meagre
food
of
date
,
place
,
and
pedigree
.
So
in
the
``
Cartas
de
Indias
''
*NL*
was
published
,
two
years
ago
,
in
Spain
,
a
facsimile
letter
from
*NL*
Cervantes
when
tax-gatherer
to
Philip
II.
,
informing
him
of
the
efforts
*NL*
he
had
made
to
collect
the
taxes
in
certain
Andalusian
villages
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
difficult
,
from
the
slight
social
record
that
we
have
of
*NL*
Cervantes
,
to
draw
the
line
where
imagination
begins
and
facts
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miguel
de
Cervantes
Saavedra
,
the
contemporary
of
Shakspeare
,
Galileo
,
*NL*
Camoens
,
Rubens
,
Tasso
,
and
Lope
de
Vega
,
was
born
obscurely
and
in
*NL*
poverty
,
but
with
good
antecedents
.
His
grandfather
,
Juan
de
Cervantes
,
*NL*
was
the
corregidor
,
or
mayor
,
of
Ossuna
,
and
our
poet
was
the
youngest
*NL*
son
of
Rodrigo
and
Leonora
de
Cortinos
,
of
the
Barajas
family
.
On
either
*NL*
side
he
belonged
to
illustrious
houses
.
He
speaks
of
his
birthplace
as
*NL*
the
``
famous
Henares
,
''
--
``
Alcala
de
Henares
,
''
sometimes
called
Alcala
de
*NL*
San
Justo
,
from
the
saint
San
Justo
having
there
suffered
martyrdom
*NL*
under
the
traitor
Daciamos
.
The
town
is
beautifully
situated
on
the
*NL*
borders
of
the
Henares
River
,
two
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
*NL*
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
born
on
Sunday
,
October
9
,
1547
,
and
was
baptized
in
the
church
*NL*
of
Santa
Maria
la
Mayor
,
receiving
his
name
on
the
fete
day
of
his
*NL*
patron
Saint
Miguel
,
which
some
biographers
have
confounded
with
that
of
*NL*
his
birthday
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
may
be
forgiven
for
a
few
words
about
Alcala
de
Henares
,
since
,
had
*NL*
it
only
produced
so
rare
a
man
as
was
Cervantes
,
it
would
have
had
*NL*
sufficient
distinction
;
but
it
was
a
town
of
an
eventful
historical
*NL*
record
.
It
was
destroyed
about
the
year
1000
,
and
rebuilt
and
possessed
*NL*
by
the
Moors
,
was
afterwards
conquered
by
Bernardo
,
Archbishop
of
*NL*
Toledo
.
Three
hundred
years
later
it
was
the
favorite
retreat
of
*NL*
Ximenes
,
then
Cardinal
Archbishop
of
Toledo
,
who
returned
to
it
,
after
*NL*
his
splendid
conquests
,
laden
with
gold
and
silver
spoil
taken
from
the
*NL*
mosques
of
Oran
,
and
with
a
far
richer
treasure
of
precious
Arabian
*NL*
manuscripts
,
intended
for
such
a
university
as
had
long
been
his
*NL*
ambition
to
create
,
and
the
corner-stone
of
which
he
laid
with
his
own
*NL*
hands
in
1500
.
There
was
a
very
solemn
ceremonial
at
the
founding
of
*NL*
this
famous
university
,
and
a
hiding
away
of
coins
and
inscriptions
*NL*
under
its
massive
walls
,
and
a
pious
invocation
to
Heaven
for
a
special
*NL*
blessing
on
the
archbishop
's
design
!
At
the
end
of
eight
years
the
*NL*
extensive
and
splendid
buildings
were
finished
and
the
whole
town
*NL*
improved
.
With
the
quickening
of
literary
labor
and
the
increase
of
*NL*
opportunities
of
acquiring
knowledge
,
the
reputation
of
the
university
*NL*
was
of
the
highest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
's
comprehensive
mind
included
in
its
professorships
all
*NL*
that
he
considered
useful
in
the
arts
.
Emulation
was
encouraged
,
and
*NL*
every
effort
was
made
to
draw
talent
from
obscurity
.
To
this
enlightened
*NL*
ecclesiastic
is
the
world
indebted
for
the
undertaking
of
the
Polyglot
*NL*
Bible
,
which
,
in
connection
with
other
learned
works
,
led
the
university
*NL*
to
be
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
greatest
educational
establishments
in
the
*NL*
world
.
From
far
and
near
were
people
drawn
to
it
.
King
Ferdinand
paid
*NL*
homage
to
his
subject
's
noble
testimonial
of
labor
,
by
visiting
the
*NL*
cardinal
at
Alcala
de
Henares
,
and
acknowledging
that
his
own
reign
had
*NL*
received
both
benefit
and
glory
from
it
.
The
people
of
Alcala
punningly
*NL*
said
,
the
church
of
Toledo
had
never
had
a
bishop
of
greater
*NL*
_
edification
_
than
Ximenes
;
and
Erasmus
,
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
*NL*
Vergara
,
perpetrates
a
Greek
pun
on
the
classic
name
of
Alcala
,
*NL*
intimating
the
highest
opinion
of
the
state
of
science
there
.
The
*NL*
reclining
statue
of
Ximenes
,
beautifully
carved
in
alabaster
,
now
*NL*
ornaments
his
sepulchre
in
the
College
of
St.
Ildefonso
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cervantes
shared
the
honor
of
the
birthplace
with
the
Emperor
Ferdinand
;
*NL*
he
of
``
blessed
memory
,
''
who
failed
to
obtain
permission
from
the
Pope
*NL*
for
priests
to
marry
,
but
who
,
in
spite
of
turbulent
times
,
maintained
*NL*
religious
peace
in
Germany
,
and
lived
to
see
the
closing
of
the
Council
*NL*
of
Trent
,
marking
his
reign
as
one
of
the
most
enlightened
of
the
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alcala
also
claims
Antonio
de
Solis
,
the
well-known
historian
,
whose
*NL*
``
Conquest
of
Mexico
''
has
been
translated
into
many
languages
,
as
well
as
*NL*
Teodora
de
Beza
,
a
zealous
Calvinistic
reformer
and
famous
divine
,
a
*NL*
sharer
of
Calvin
's
labors
in
Switzerland
and
author
of
the
celebrated
*NL*
manuscripts
known
as
Beza
's
manuscripts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judging
from
the
character
of
the
town
and
the
refining
educational
*NL*
influence
that
so
grand
a
university
must
have
had
over
its
inhabitants
,
*NL*
we
have
a
right
to
believe
that
Cervantes
was
early
imbued
with
all
that
*NL*
was
noble
and
good
,
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
,
with
all
the
*NL*
advantages
which
the
College
of
St.
Ildefonso
opened
to
him
,
he
should
*NL*
have
been
sent
away
from
it
to
that
of
Salamanca
.
Even
allowing
that
the
*NL*
supposition
of
early
poverty
was
correct
,
it
would
have
appeared
an
*NL*
additional
reason
for
his
being
educated
in
his
native
town
,
*NL*
particularly
as
liberal
foundations
were
made
for
indigent
students
.
*NL*
The
fact
of
his
being
sent
to
Salamanca
would
seem
to
disprove
the
*NL*
supposition
of
pecuniary
necessity
.
In
its
early
days
,
the
university
of
*NL*
Salamanca
was
justly
celebrated
for
its
progress
in
astronomy
and
*NL*
familiarity
with
Greek
and
Arabian
writers
;
but
,
during
the
fifteenth
*NL*
and
sixteenth
centuries
,
it
seems
to
have
remained
very
stationary
,
*NL*
little
attention
being
paid
to
aught
beside
medicine
and
dogmatic
*NL*
theology
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
being
two
years
at
Salamanca
he
changed
to
Madrid
,
where
he
is
*NL*
supposed
to
have
made
great
progress
,
under
the
care
of
Juan
Lopez
de
*NL*
Hoyos
,
a
professor
of
_
belles
lettres
_
,
who
spoke
of
Cervantes
as
``
our
*NL*
dear
and
beloved
pupil
.
''
Hoyos
was
himself
a
poet
,
and
occasionally
*NL*
published
collections
to
which
Cervantes
contributed
his
pastoral
*NL*
``
Filena
,
''
which
was
much
admired
at
the
time
.
He
also
wrote
several
*NL*
ballads
;
but
ballads
generally
belong
to
their
own
age
,
and
those
that
*NL*
remain
to
us
of
his
have
lost
much
of
their
poignancy
.
Two
poems
,
*NL*
written
on
the
death
of
Isabella
of
Valois
,
wife
of
Philip
II.
,
*NL*
specially
pleased
Hoyos
,
who
at
the
time
gave
full
credit
to
his
*NL*
promising
pupil
.
That
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
,
the
Escurial
,
was
in
*NL*
progress
during
Cervantes
'
time
in
Madrid
;
built
as
expiatory
by
the
*NL*
king
,
the
husband
of
the
same
unfortunate
Isabella
.
He
was
that
subtle
*NL*
tyrant
of
Spain
,
who
had
the
grace
to
say
,
on
the
destruction
of
the
*NL*
Invincible
Armada
,
``
I
sent
my
fleet
to
combat
with
the
English
,
not
with
*NL*
the
elements
.
God
's
will
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
yet
a
boy
,
bull-fights
were
introduced
into
Spain
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
the
ungentle
sport
that
oft
invites
*NL*
The
Spanish
maid
,
and
cheers
the
Spanish
swain
,
*NL*
Nurtured
in
blood
betimes
,
his
heart
delights
*NL*
In
vengeance
,
gloating
on
another
's
pain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
attention
of
the
Cardinal
Acquaviva
was
called
to
him
through
his
*NL*
composition
of
``
Filena
,
''
and
,
in
1568
or
1569
,
he
joined
the
household
*NL*
of
the
cardinal
and
accompanied
him
to
Rome
.
It
is
sad
to
think
that
*NL*
only
a
few
meagre
items
are
all
that
remain
to
tell
us
of
his
daily
life
*NL*
at
this
important
period
of
his
life
.
By
some
of
his
biographers
he
is
*NL*
mentioned
as
being
under
the
protection
of
the
cardinal
;
by
one
as
*NL*
seeking
to
better
his
penniless
condition
;
by
another
as
having
the
*NL*
place
of
_
valet
de
chambre
_
;
and
still
again
,
we
find
him
mentioned
as
a
*NL*
chamberlain
in
the
household
.
Monsignor
Guilio
Acquaviva
,
in
1568
,
went
*NL*
as
ambassador
to
Spain
to
offer
the
king
the
condolences
of
the
Pontiff
*NL*
on
the
death
of
Don
Carlos
.
The
cardinal
was
a
man
of
high
position
,
*NL*
young
,
yet
of
great
accomplishments
,
and
with
cultivated
literary
*NL*
tastes
.
What
then
could
have
been
more
natural
than
that
he
should
have
*NL*
found
companionship
in
Cervantes
,
and
have
desired
to
attach
him
to
*NL*
himself
as
a
friend
or
as
a
confidential
secretary
,
to
be
always
near
*NL*
him
.
It
is
more
than
probable
that
his
impressions
of
Southern
France
,
*NL*
which
he
immortalized
in
his
early
pastoral
romance
of
``
Galatea
''
were
*NL*
imbibed
while
making
the
journey
to
Rome
with
the
cardinal
,
in
whose
*NL*
service
he
must
have
remained
three
years
,
as
in
October
7
,
1571
,
we
*NL*
find
him
joining
the
united
Venetian
,
Papal
,
and
Spanish
expedition
*NL*
commanded
by
Don
John
of
Austria
,
against
the
Turks
and
the
African
*NL*
corsairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
naval
engagement
at
Lepanto
,
Cervantes
was
badly
wounded
,
and
*NL*
finally
lost
his
left
hand
and
part
of
the
arm
.
For
six
months
he
was
*NL*
immured
in
the
hospital
at
Messina
.
After
his
recovery
,
he
joined
the
*NL*
expedition
to
the
Levant
,
commanded
by
Marco
Antonio
Colonna
,
Duke
of
*NL*
Valiano
.
He
joined
at
intervals
various
other
expeditions
,
and
not
till
*NL*
after
his
prominence
in
the
engagement
at
Tunis
,
did
he
,
in
1575
,
start
*NL*
to
return
to
Spain
,
the
land
of
his
heart
,
the
theme
of
the
poet
,
and
*NL*
the
region
supposed
by
the
Moors
to
have
dropped
from
heaven
.
Don
John
*NL*
of
Austria
and
Don
Carlos
of
Arragon
,
Viceroy
of
Sicily
,
each
bore
the
*NL*
warmest
testimony
to
the
bravery
and
heroism
of
our
poet
,
and
each
gave
*NL*
him
strong
letters
of
commendation
to
the
king
of
Spain
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
company
with
his
own
brother
Roderigo
,
and
other
wounded
soldiers
*NL*
who
were
returning
home
,
he
started
in
the
ship
_
El
Sol
_
,
which
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
,
September
26
,
1575
,
to
be
captured
by
an
Algerine
squadron
.
*NL*
Then
it
happened
that
the
letters
from
the
two
kings
,
so
highly
prized
*NL*
and
upon
which
he
had
built
so
many
hopes
,
proved
a
great
misfortune
to
*NL*
him
.
The
pirates
cast
lots
for
the
captives
.
Cervantes
fell
to
the
share
*NL*
of
the
captain
,
Dali
Mami
by
name
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
finding
these
*NL*
two
letters
,
imagined
he
must
be
some
Don
of
great
importance
and
worth
*NL*
a
heavy
ransom
.
He
was
watched
and
guarded
with
great
strictness
,
loaded
*NL*
with
heavy
fetters
,
and
subjected
to
cruelties
of
every
kind
,
till
his
*NL*
captor
,
not
finding
him
of
so
much
account
as
he
had
supposed
,
and
no
*NL*
money
being
offered
for
his
ransom
,
the
captain
finally
sold
him
for
*NL*
five
hundred
escudos
to
the
Dey
Azan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Inasmuch
as
a
change
might
lead
to
something
better
,
Cervantes
rejoiced
.
*NL*
His
gallant
spirit
,
ever
hopeful
,
looked
for
the
open
door
in
*NL*
misfortune
.
But
,
alas
!
his
increased
sufferings
with
the
Dey
reached
a
*NL*
climax
almost
beyond
endurance
.
He
made
every
struggle
to
escape
;
but
*NL*
even
in
the
midst
of
all
his
own
sufferings
,
he
found
ways
of
aiding
his
*NL*
fellow-victims
and
inspiring
them
with
the
hopes
denied
to
himself
.
*NL*
Roderigo
had
escaped
long
before
,
and
from
that
time
was
making
constant
*NL*
exertion
to
raise
the
needful
amount
to
redeem
Miguel
from
the
Dey
,
but
*NL*
not
till
September
,
1580
,
did
he
succeed
in
effecting
his
release
;
some
*NL*
biographers
making
it
a
still
later
date
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
had
long
been
dead
,
and
his
mother
and
sisters
gathered
what
*NL*
they
could
,
but
the
combined
family
efforts
were
insufficient
.
There
was
*NL*
a
society
of
pious
and
generous
monks
,
who
made
special
exertions
to
*NL*
assist
in
the
liberation
of
Christian
captives
,
and
they
finally
made
up
*NL*
the
amount
demanded
by
Azan
for
Cervantes
'
release
.
*NL*
*NL*
Worn
down
in
spirit
,
broken
in
health
,
crushed
at
heart
,
who
may
venture
*NL*
to
speak
of
the
effect
upon
him
when
he
once
more
found
himself
at
home
*NL*
and
in
the
embraces
of
his
family
?
He
himself
says
:
``
What
transport
in
*NL*
life
can
equal
that
which
a
man
feels
on
the
restoration
of
his
*NL*
liberty
?
''
There
is
probably
no
more
thrilling
or
exact
an
account
of
the
*NL*
Algerine
slavery
than
he
has
given
in
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
Whether
his
love
*NL*
for
a
military
life
still
pursued
him
,
whether
he
desired
an
opportunity
*NL*
for
revenge
upon
his
persecutors
,
or
whether
it
was
fatality
,
--
maimed
*NL*
and
ruined
as
he
was
he
once
more
entered
the
army
.
We
can
not
analyze
*NL*
his
motive
.
He
makes
his
bachelor
Sampson
say
,
``
The
historian
must
pen
*NL*
things
not
as
they
ought
to
have
been
but
as
they
really
were
,
without
*NL*
adding
to
or
diminishing
aught
from
the
truth
.
''
The
lives
of
literary
*NL*
men
are
not
always
devoid
of
stirring
incidents
.
M.
Viardot
says
of
*NL*
him
:
``
Cervantes
was
an
illustrious
man
before
he
became
an
illustrious
*NL*
author
;
the
doer
of
great
deeds
before
he
produced
an
immortal
book
.
''
*NL*
Don
Lope
de
Figueras
then
commanded
a
regiment
of
tried
and
veteran
*NL*
soldiers
in
the
army
of
the
Duke
of
Alva
,
in
Portugal
.
His
brother
*NL*
Roderigo
was
serving
in
it
when
he
joined
it
;
and
as
Figueras
had
known
*NL*
Cervantes
in
former
campaigns
,
it
is
most
probable
he
was
in
his
*NL*
regiment
.
Later
on
,
we
find
Cervantes
accompanying
the
Marquis
de
Santa
*NL*
Cruz
on
an
expedition
to
the
Azores
,
serving
long
and
bravely
under
him
.
*NL*
The
conquest
of
the
Azores
is
described
as
a
fiercely
won
but
brilliant
*NL*
victory
over
all
the
islands
;
and
Cervantes
immortalized
the
genius
and
*NL*
gallantry
of
the
admiral
in
a
sonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
of
adventure
ran
high
among
the
Castilians
,
while
the
whole
*NL*
nation
was
at
the
same
time
in
course
of
mental
as
well
as
moral
*NL*
development
.
We
are
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
Spain
in
many
ways
was
*NL*
far
behind
Italy
,
though
hardly
as
some
would
have
it
,
at
the
distance
*NL*
of
half
a
century
.
We
must
remember
that
,
in
1530
,
there
were
only
two
*NL*
hundred
printing-presses
in
the
whole
of
Europe
,
and
that
when
the
first
*NL*
one
was
set
up
in
London
,
the
Westminster
abbot
exclaimed
,
``
Brethren
,
*NL*
this
is
a
tremendous
engine
!
We
must
control
it
,
or
it
will
conquer
us
.
''
*NL*
The
first
press
in
Spain
was
set
up
in
Valencia
,
in
1474
,
and
Clemencin
*NL*
says
that
more
printing-presses
in
the
infancy
of
the
art
were
probably
*NL*
at
work
in
Spain
than
there
are
at
the
present
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
change
seemed
to
have
crept
gradually
over
the
whole
national
*NL*
character
of
Spain
after
the
brilliant
and
prosperous
reign
of
Ferdinand
*NL*
and
Isabella
,
commencing
with
the
severity
of
the
Inquisition
and
*NL*
continuing
under
the
tyranny
of
Philip
II.
,
predisposing
the
army
to
*NL*
savage
deeds
,
till
even
the
women
and
children
were
infected
and
the
*NL*
literature
of
the
period
slightly
tinged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cervantes
is
too
often
merged
into
Don
Quixote
as
if
he
had
no
separate
*NL*
existence
.
He
accomplished
more
for
the
improvement
of
Spanish
*NL*
literature
with
his
well-timed
satire
than
all
the
laws
or
sermons
could
*NL*
effect
.
His
remarkable
mind
seems
to
have
escaped
the
influence
of
the
*NL*
times
,
unless
we
make
an
exception
of
his
drama
``
Numancia
,
''
which
,
while
*NL*
it
excites
the
imagination
,
fills
us
with
horror
at
its
details
,
and
*NL*
fails
to
touch
our
hearts
,
but
is
full
of
historical
truths
.
Schlegel
,
*NL*
however
,
reviews
it
with
enthusiasm
.
He
calls
his
``
Life
in
Algiers
''
a
*NL*
comedy
,
but
undoubtedly
it
is
a
true
picture
of
his
own
captivity
.
We
*NL*
are
touched
and
filled
with
gloom
at
its
perusal
,
and
only
remember
it
*NL*
as
a
tragedy
.
These
two
dramas
were
lost
sight
of
till
the
end
of
the
*NL*
eighteenth
century
,
and
they
are
superior
to
later
dramatic
efforts
.
He
*NL*
was
proud
of
his
original
conception
of
a
tragedy
composed
of
ideal
and
*NL*
allegorical
characters
which
he
permitted
to
have
part
in
the
``
Life
in
*NL*
Algiers
,
''
as
well
as
in
``
Numancia
.
''
Of
the
thirty
plays
spoken
of
as
*NL*
given
to
the
stage
but
few
now
remain
;
but
others
may
yet
be
found
.
The
*NL*
Spaniards
say
the
faults
of
a
great
writer
are
not
left
in
the
*NL*
ink-stand
.
Spain
,
in
Cervantes
'
day
,
had
passed
the
chivalric
age
,
*NL*
though
many
relics
of
it
still
remained
in
its
legends
,
songs
,
and
*NL*
proverbs
.
Cervantes
becomes
his
own
critic
in
his
``
Supplement
to
a
*NL*
Journey
to
Parnassus
,
''
and
speaking
of
his
dramas
,
says
:
``
I
should
*NL*
declare
them
worthy
the
favor
they
have
received
were
they
not
my
own
.
''
*NL*
Unfortunately
,
his
comedy
of
``
La
Confusa
''
is
among
the
lost
ones
.
He
*NL*
alludes
to
it
as
a
good
one
among
the
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
known
Cervantes
as
a
student
,
a
soldier
,
a
captive
,
and
an
*NL*
author
,
and
now
we
have
to
imagine
our
maimed
and
bronzed
soldier-poet
,
*NL*
after
his
many
fortunes
of
war
,
in
the
new
character
of
a
lover
.
In
*NL*
thought
we
trace
his
noble
features
,
his
intelligent
look
and
expressive
*NL*
eye
,
combined
with
his
dignified
bearing
and
thoughtful
manner
,
and
in
*NL*
so
tracing
we
find
it
congenial
to
imagine
him
as
being
well
dressed
and
*NL*
enveloped
in
the
ample
Spanish
cloak
thrown
gracefully
over
his
breast
*NL*
and
left
shoulder
,
concealing
the
poor
mutilated
arm
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
making
it
all
the
more
difficult
to
believe
that
the
right
one
had
*NL*
ever
wielded
a
``
Toledo
blade
''
or
sworn
that
very
strongest
vow
of
*NL*
loyalty
,
``
A
fe
de
Rodrigo
.

*NL*
*NL*
We
find
him
much
interested
in
the
quaint
old-fashioned
town
of
*NL*
Esquivias
,
making
many
friends
therein
,
and
sometimes
gossiping
with
the
*NL*
host
of
the
_
fonda
_
,
so
famed
for
the
generous
wines
of
Esquivias
that
*NL*
it
needed
no
``
bush
;
''
and
while
enjoying
his
cigarito
and
taking
an
*NL*
occasional
morsel
from
the
dish
of
_
quisado
_
before
him
,
he
is
learning
*NL*
from
the
same
gossiping
host
many
items
of
interest
about
the
very
*NL*
illustrious
families
of
Esquivias
,
--
for
it
was
famed
for
its
chivalrous
*NL*
prowess
and
its
``
claims
of
long
descent
.
''
He
had
commenced
his
*NL*
``
Galatea
,
''
and
in
it
he
was
painting
living
portraits
,
and
with
great
*NL*
delicacy
he
was
,
as
the
shepherd
Elicio
,
portraying
his
passion
for
*NL*
Catalina
,
the
daughter
of
Fernando
de
Salazar
y
Voxmediano
and
Catalina
*NL*
de
Palacios
,
both
of
illustrious
families
.
Her
father
was
dead
,
and
she
*NL*
had
been
educated
by
her
uncle
,
Francisco
de
Salazar
,
who
left
her
a
*NL*
legacy
in
his
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fair
Catalina
,
like
other
Spanish
senoritas
,
was
under
the
espionage
*NL*
of
a
strict
duena
,
and
his
opportunities
of
seeing
her
were
very
*NL*
limited
.
Sometimes
we
fancy
him
awaiting
the
passing
of
the
hour
of
the
*NL*
siesta
and
knocking
at
the
grating
of
the
heavy
door
of
the
house
of
the
*NL*
Salazars
,
and
in
reply
to
the
porter
's
question
of
_
Quien
es
_
?
*NL*
answering
,
in
his
melodious
tones
,
_
Gente
de
paz
_
-LRB-
literally
,
``
a
*NL*
friend
''
-RRB-
,
--
a
precaution
which
still
continues
in
Spain
.
Meanwhile
,
his
*NL*
romance
of
``
Galatea
''
and
of
his
own
life
are
both
growing
.
The
occasion
*NL*
inspires
him
.
He
is
still
in
Esquivias
,
wandering
through
the
olive
*NL*
groves
and
by
the
river
side
,
sometimes
resting
,
and
drinking
in
the
*NL*
fragrance
from
an
orange-tree
while
his
untold
wealth
of
brain
was
*NL*
seeking
for
its
exit
.
Sometimes
he
had
Catalina
for
a
companion
,
the
*NL*
duena
lingering
slightly
behind
.
Sometimes
he
saw
her
at
the
church
like
*NL*
a
fair
saint
,
kneeling
;
but
oftener
he
wandered
alone
with
his
now
happy
*NL*
thoughts
,
scarce
knowing
that
the
night
was
closing
about
him
,
or
scarce
*NL*
heeding
the
watchman
who
cried
,
``
All
hail
,
Mary
,
mother
of
Jesus
!
half
*NL*
past
twelve
o'clock
and
a
cloudy
morning
!
''
and
thus
,
to
this
day
,
are
*NL*
the
Spaniards
warned
of
the
hour
and
the
weather
.
His
``
Galatea
''
remains
*NL*
unfinished
.
He
had
not
meant
that
all
this
song
should
be
for
the
public
*NL*
ear
.
The
end
was
for
his
love
alone
!
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
12th
of
December
,
1584
,
he
was
married
to
Catalina
.
Not
many
*NL*
years
ago
,
the
marriage
contract
was
found
in
the
public
registry
of
*NL*
Esquivias
.
It
contains
an
inventory
of
the
marriage-dowry
promised
by
*NL*
the
bride
's
mother
,
of
``
lands
,
furniture
,
utensils
,
and
live-stock
.
''
*NL*
Then
follows
the
details
,
``
several
vineyards
,
amounting
to
twelve
acres
,
*NL*
beds
,
chairs
,
brooms
,
brushes
,
poultry
,
and
sundry
sacks
of
flour
.
''
It
*NL*
is
spoken
of
as
a
very
respectable
dowry
at
a
time
when
sacks
of
wheat
*NL*
were
worth
eight
reals
.
Then
follows
,
in
the
same
document
,
his
own
*NL*
settlement
upon
his
wife
,
which
is
stated
to
be
one
hundred
ducats
.
By
*NL*
the
custom
of
the
time
that
was
one-tenth
of
his
whole
property
,
or
to
*NL*
quote
again
,
which
``
must
have
amounted
to
a
thousand
ducats
,
which
at
*NL*
present
would
be
equivalent
to
about
four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
*NL*
sterling
.
''
Gladly
would
we
find
some
pleasant
items
of
happy
home
life
,
*NL*
though
,
for
the
next
four
years
,
he
lived
quietly
at
Esquivias
,
and
*NL*
cared
for
the
vineyards
like
any
landholder
,
till
,
perhaps
,
he
tired
and
*NL*
went
on
to
Seville
,
where
he
took
up
some
mercantile
business
,
though
*NL*
never
entirely
giving
up
the
pen
;
but
from
1598
till
1605
,
there
are
no
*NL*
real
traces
of
him
,
when
it
would
appear
that
he
had
removed
to
*NL*
Valladolid
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
little
doubt
but
that
he
suffered
both
in
purse
and
feeling
*NL*
from
want
of
appreciation
;
but
the
Spanish
proverb
says
,
``
An
author
's
*NL*
work
who
looks
to
money
is
the
coat
of
a
tailor
who
works
late
on
the
*NL*
vespers
of
Easter
Sunday
.
''
He
had
too
noble
a
mind
to
harbor
so
mean
a
*NL*
sentiment
as
jealousy
,
and
was
far
in
advance
of
his
age
.
His
*NL*
countrymen
,
with
characteristic
indolence
,
were
ready
to
cry
,
_
manana
,
*NL*
manana
_
-LRB-
to-morrow
,
to-morrow
-RRB-
,
and
so
it
was
left
for
later
generations
*NL*
to
honor
his
memory
,
for
his
power
of
invention
and
purity
of
*NL*
imagination
can
never
be
rivalled
.
While
acting
as
clerk
in
Seville
to
*NL*
Antonio
de
Guevara
,
the
Commissary-General
to
the
Indian
and
American
*NL*
dependencies
,
he
must
have
been
sadly
disappointed
,
particularly
as
,
*NL*
during
that
time
,
he
had
been
unjustly
thrown
into
prison
on
the
plea
of
*NL*
not
accounting
for
trust-money
with
satisfaction
.
Mr.
Ticknor
gives
the
*NL*
following
interesting
account
:
``
During
his
residence
at
Seville
,
*NL*
Cervantes
made
an
ineffectual
application
to
the
king
for
an
appointment
*NL*
in
America
,
setting
forth
by
the
exact
documents
a
general
account
of
*NL*
his
adventures
,
services
,
and
sufferings
while
a
soldier
in
the
Levant
,
*NL*
and
of
the
miseries
of
his
life
while
a
slave
in
Algiers
;
but
no
other
*NL*
than
a
formal
answer
seems
to
have
been
returned
to
his
application
,
and
*NL*
the
whole
affair
leaves
us
to
infer
the
severity
of
that
distress
which
*NL*
could
induce
him
to
seek
relief
in
exile
to
a
colony
of
which
he
has
*NL*
elsewhere
spoken
as
the
great
resort
for
rogues
.
''
The
appointment
he
*NL*
desired
was
either
corregidor
-LRB-
or
mayor
-RRB-
of
the
city
of
Paz
or
the
*NL*
auditorship
of
New
Grenada
,
the
governorship
of
the
province
of
*NL*
Socunusco
or
that
of
the
galleys
of
Carthagena
.
His
removal
to
*NL*
Valladolid
seems
to
have
been
by
command
of
the
revenue
authorities
,
*NL*
where
he
still
collected
taxes
for
public
and
private
persons
.
While
*NL*
collecting
for
the
prior
of
the
order
of
St.
John
,
he
was
again
*NL*
ill-treated
and
thrown
into
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
till
he
was
fifty-eight
years
old
did
he
give
to
the
world
his
*NL*
master-piece
,
and
thus
immortalizes
La
Mancha
,
in
return
for
his
*NL*
inhospitable
and
cruel
treatment
.
``
Don
Quixote
''
was
licensed
at
*NL*
Valladolid
in
1604
,
and
printed
at
Madrid
in
1605
.
Its
success
was
so
*NL*
great
that
,
during
his
lifetime
,
thirty
thousand
volumes
were
printed
,
*NL*
which
in
that
day
was
little
short
of
marvellous
.
Four
editions
were
*NL*
published
the
first
year
,
two
at
Madrid
,
one
at
Valencia
,
and
one
at
*NL*
Lisbon
.
Byron
says
:
``
Cervantes
laugh
'd
Spain
's
chivalry
away
!
''
So
*NL*
popular
was
it
,
that
a
spurious
second
part
,
under
the
fictitious
*NL*
authorship
of
Avellanada
was
published
.
Cervantes
was
furious
,
and
*NL*
called
him
a
blockhead
;
but
Germond
de
Lavigue
,
the
distinguished
*NL*
Spanish
scholar
,
rashly
asserts
that
but
for
this
Avellanada
,
he
would
*NL*
never
have
finished
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
Even
before
it
was
printed
,
jealousy
*NL*
evidently
existed
in
the
hearts
of
rival
writers
,
for
in
one
of
Lope
's
*NL*
letters
he
refers
to
it
,
and
spitefully
hints
that
no
poet
could
be
*NL*
found
to
write
commendatory
verses
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recognized
the
fact
of
universal
selfishness
when
he
makes
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
refuse
to
learn
the
Don
's
love-letter
and
say
,
``
Write
it
,
your
*NL*
worship
,
for
it
's
sheer
nonsense
to
trust
anything
to
my
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Spain
is
so
full
of
rich
material
for
romance
that
from
it
his
mature
*NL*
mind
seemed
to
inaugurate
a
new
age
in
Spanish
literature
.
After
the
*NL*
gloomy
intolerance
of
Philip
II.
,
the
advent
of
Philip
III
.
added
much
*NL*
to
the
literary
freedom
of
Spain
,
which
still
belonged
to
the
``
Age
of
*NL*
Chivalry
,
''
and
to
this
day
the
true
Spaniard
nourishes
the
lofty
and
*NL*
romantic
qualities
which
,
combined
with
a
tone
of
sentiment
and
gravity
*NL*
and
nobility
of
conversation
,
embellishes
the
legitimate
grandee
.
*NL*
Sismondi
de
Sismondi
says
the
style
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
is
inimitable
.
*NL*
Montesquieu
says
:
``
It
is
written
to
prove
all
others
useless
.
''
To
some
*NL*
it
is
an
allegory
,
to
some
a
tragedy
,
to
some
a
parable
,
and
to
others
a
*NL*
satire
.
As
a
satirist
we
think
him
unrivalled
,
and
this
spirit
found
a
*NL*
choice
opportunity
for
vent
when
the
troops
of
Don
Carlos
I.
marched
*NL*
upon
Rome
,
taking
Pope
Clement
VII
.
prisoner
,
while
at
the
same
time
the
*NL*
king
was
having
prayers
said
in
the
churches
of
Madrid
for
the
*NL*
deliverance
of
the
Pope
,
on
the
plea
that
``
he
was
obliged
to
make
war
*NL*
against
the
_
temporal
_
sovereign
of
Rome
,
but
not
upon
the
spiritual
*NL*
head
of
the
Church
!
''
No
wonder
the
king
,
after
proving
himself
so
good
a
*NL*
Catholic
,
should
end
his
days
in
a
monastery
,
or
that
he
should
mortify
*NL*
himself
by
lying
in
a
coffin
,
wrapped
in
a
shroud
,
while
funeral
*NL*
services
were
performed
over
him
.
What
,
again
,
could
have
appealed
more
*NL*
to
his
sense
of
the
ridiculous
than
the
contest
between
the
priests
and
*NL*
the
authorities
over
the
funeral
obsequies
of
Philip
II.
,
so
intolerant
*NL*
a
tyrant
that
he
caused
every
Spaniard
to
breathe
more
freely
as
he
*NL*
ceased
so
to
do
.
He
used
his
people
as
*NL*
*NL*
``
Broken
tools
,
that
tyrants
cast
away
*NL*
By
myriads
,
when
they
dare
to
pave
their
way
*NL*
With
human
hearts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
can
easily
believe
in
the
greater
freedom
during
the
reign
of
Philip
*NL*
III
.
``
Viva
el

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
de
Lemos
was
his
near
friend
and
protector
when
he
brought
out
*NL*
the
second
part
of
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
and
ridiculed
his
rival
imitator
.
He
*NL*
was
a
pioneer
of
so
elevated
a
character
as
to
preclude
the
possibility
*NL*
of
followers
.
Every
one
is
familiar
with
it
as
a
story
,
and
the
mishaps
*NL*
of
the
gentle
,
noble-minded
,
kind-hearted
old
Don
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
delusions
,
simplicity
,
and
selfishness
of
the
devoted
squire
,
will
never
*NL*
lose
their
power
to
amuse
.
It
may
be
extravagant
,
but
it
is
not
a
*NL*
burlesque
.
The
strong
character
painting
,
the
ideas

situations
,
and
*NL*
language
,
clothed
in
such
simplicity
that
at
times
it
becomes
almost
*NL*
solemn
,
give
it
a
grandeur
that
no
other
book
,
considered
as
a
romance
,
*NL*
possesses
.
The
old
anecdote
of
the
king
observing
a
student
walking
by
*NL*
the
river
side
and
bursting
into
involuntary
fits
of
laughter
over
a
*NL*
book
,
exclaiming
,
``
The
man
is
either
mad
or
reading
`
Don

,
'
''
is
*NL*
well
preserved
.
One
peculiar
feature
of
the
book
is
that
,
even
now
,
for
*NL*
some
places
,
it
would
be
a
useful
guide
,
many
of
the
habits
and
customs
*NL*
of
Spain
three
hundred
years
ago
being
still
the

.
What
a
volume
of
*NL*
wit
and
wisdom
is
contained
in
the

.
One
might
*NL*
quote
from
it
indefinitely
had
he
not
told
us
that
``
without
discretion
*NL*
there
is
no
wit
.
''
His
own
motive
in
writing
it
we
find
in
the
last
*NL*
paragraph
of
the
book
,
namely
,
``
My
sole
object
has
been
to
expose
to
the
*NL*
contempt
they
deserved
the
extravagant
and
silly
tricks
of
chivalry
,
*NL*
which
this
my
true
and
genuine
`
Don
Quixote
'
has
nearly
accomplished
,
*NL*
their
worldly
credit
being
now
actually
tottering
,
and
will
doubtless
*NL*
soon
sink
,
never
to
rise
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
all
languages
have
it
.
There
are
eight
translations
into
English
*NL*
alone
;
but
it
is
always
impossible
for
the
translator
to
render
its
true
*NL*
spirit
or
to
give
it
full
justice
.
With
all
its
vivacity
and
drollery
,
*NL*
its
delicate
satire
and
keen
ridicule
,
it
has
a
mournful
tinge
of
*NL*
melancholy
running
through
,
and
here
and
there
peeping
out
,
only
to
have
*NL*
been
gathered
from
such
experience
as
his
.
He
wrote
with
neither
*NL*
bitterness
nor
a
diseased
imagination
,
always
realizing
what
is
due
to
*NL*
himself
and
with
a
full
appreciation
of
and
desire
for
fame
.
Many
scenes
*NL*
of
real
suffering
appear
under
a
dramatic
guise
,
and
here
and
there
*NL*
creep
out
bits
of
personal
history
.
His
nature
was
chivalrous
in
the
*NL*
highest
degree
.
His
sorrows
were
greater
than
his
joys
.
Born
for
the
*NL*
library
,
he
prefers
the
camp
,
and
abandons
literature
to
fight
the
*NL*
Turks
.
Does
he
not
make
the
Don
say
,
``
Let
none
presume
to
tell
me
the
*NL*
pen
is
preferable
to
the
sword
.
''
Again
he
says
:
``
Allowing
that
the
end
*NL*
of
war
is
peace
,
and
that
in
this
it
exceeds
the
end
of
learning
,
let
us
*NL*
weigh
the
bodily
labors
the
scholar
undergoes
against
those
the
warrior
*NL*
suffers
,
and
then
see
which
are
the
greatest
.
''
Then
he
enumerates
:
*NL*
``
First
,
poverty
;
and
having
said
he
endures
poverty
,
methinks
nothing
*NL*
more
need
be
urged
to
express
his
misery
,
for
he
that
is
poor
enjoys
no
*NL*
happiness
,
but
labors
under
this
poverty
in
all
its
guises
,
at
one
time
*NL*
in
hunger
,
at
another
in
cold
,
another
in
nakedness
,
and
sometimes
in
*NL*
all
of
them
together
.
''
Later
on
he
makes
him
say
:
``
It
gives
me
some
*NL*
concern
to
think
that
powder
and
lead
may
suddenly
cut
short
my
career
*NL*
of
glory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
world
can
only
be
grateful
that
``
his
career
of
glory
''
did
not
end
in
*NL*
the
military
advancement
he
had
the
right
to
expect
.
Had
he
been
a
*NL*
general
,
his
Rozinante
might
still
have
been
wandering
without
a
name
,
*NL*
and
Sancho
Panza
have
died
a
common
laborer
.
Again
he
says
:
``
Would
to
*NL*
God
I
could
find
a
place
to
serve
as
a
private
tomb
for
this
wearisome
*NL*
burden
of
life
which
I
bear
so
much
against
my
inclination
.
''
Surviving
*NL*
almost
unheard-of
grievances
only
to
emerge
from
them
with
greater
*NL*
power
;
depicting
in
his
works
true
outlines
of
his
own
adventures
,
*NL*
sometimes
by
a
proverb
,
often
by
a
romance
,
he
never
loses
one
jot
of
*NL*
his
pride
,
giving
golden
advice
to
Sancho
when
a
governor
,
and
finishing
*NL*
with
the
expression
,
``
So
may
`
st
thou
escape
the
PITY
of
the
world
.
''
In
*NL*
May
,
1605
,
he
was
called
upon
as
a
witness
in
a
case
of
a
man
who
was
*NL*
mortally
wounded
and
dragged
at
night
into
his
apartment
,
which
almost
*NL*
accidentally
gives
us
his
household
,
consisting
of
his
wife
;
his
natural
*NL*
daughter
Isabel
,
twenty
years
of
age
,
unmarried
;
his
sister
,
a
widow
,
*NL*
above
fifty
years
;
her
unmarried
daughter
,
aged
twenty-eight
;
his
*NL*
half-sister
,
a
religieuse
;
and
a
maid-servant
.
His
``
Espanola
Inglesa
''
*NL*
appeared
in
1611
.
His
moral
tales
,
the
pioneers
in
Spanish
literature
,
*NL*
are
a
combination
without
special
plan
of
serious
and
comic
,
romance
and
*NL*
anecdote
,
evidently
giving
,
under
the
guise
of
fiction
,
poetically
*NL*
colored
bits
of
his
own
experience
in
Italy
and
Africa
.
In
his
story
of
*NL*
``
La
Gitanilla
''
-LRB-
the
gipsy
girl
-RRB-
may
be
found
the
argument
of
Weber
's
*NL*
opera
of
``
Preciosa
.
''
``
Parnassus
''
was
written
two
years
before
his
death
,
*NL*
after
which
he
wrote
eight
comedies
and
a
sequel
to
his
twelve
moral
*NL*
tales
.
In
his
story
of
``
Rinconete
y
Cortadilla
''
he
evidently
derives
the
*NL*
names
from
_
rincon
_
-LRB-
a
corner
-RRB-
and
_
cortar
_
-LRB-
to
cut
-RRB-
.
His
last
work
was
*NL*
``
Persiles
and
Sigismunda
,
''
the
preface
of
which
is
a
near
presentiment
*NL*
of
his
closing
labors
.
He
says
:
``
Farewell
,
gayety
;
farewell
,
humor
;
*NL*
farewell
,
my
pleasant
friends
.
I
must
now
die
,
and
I
desire
nothing
*NL*
more
than
to
soon
see
you
again
happy
in
another
world
.
''
His
industry
*NL*
was
wonderful
.
We
can
but
have
a
grateful
feeling
towards
the
Count
de
*NL*
Lemos
for
adding
to
his
physical
comfort
for
the
last
few
years
,
and
*NL*
feel
a
regret
that
the
Count
,
who
had
lingered
in
Naples
,
could
not
have
*NL*
arrived
in
time
to
see
him
once
more
when
he
so
ardently
desired
it
.
In
*NL*
a
dedication
to
the
Count
of
his
final
romance
,
written
only
four
days
*NL*
before
his
death
,
he
very
touchingly
says
:
``
I
could
have
wished
not
to
*NL*
have
been
obliged
to
make
so
close
a
personal
application
of
the
old
*NL*
verses
commencing
`
With
the
foot
already
in
the
stirrup
,
'
for
with
very
*NL*
little
alteration
I
may
truly
say
that
with
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
*NL*
feeling
this
moment
the
pains
of
dissolution
,
I
address
this
letter
to
*NL*
you
.
Yesterday
I
received
extreme
unction
.
To-day
I
have
resumed
my
pen
.
*NL*
Time
is
short
,
my
pains
increase
,
my
hopes
diminish
,
yet
I
do
wish
my
*NL*
life
might
be
prolonged
till
I
could
see
you
again
in
Spain
.
''
His
wish
*NL*
was
not
to
be
gratified
;
the
Count
,
unaware
of
the
near
danger
of
his
*NL*
friend
,
only
returned
to
find
himself
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
his
*NL*
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
sixty-nine
years
of
varied
fortunes
and
many
struggles
,
Miguel
de
*NL*
Cervantes
Saavedra
breathed
his
last
,
unsoothed
by
the
hands
he
had
*NL*
loved
,
for
even
this
privilege
seems
to
have
been
denied
to
him
.
At
the
*NL*
near
end
of
his
life
he
had
joined
the
kindly
third
order
of
the
*NL*
Franciscan
friars
,
and
the
brethren
cared
for
him
at
the
last
.
His
*NL*
remarkable
clearness
of
intellect
never
failed
him
,
and
on
April
23
,
*NL*
1616
,
the
very
day
that
Shakspeare
died
at
Stratford
,
Cervantes
died
at
*NL*
Madrid
.
Unlike
the
great
English
contemporary
,
whose
undisturbed
bones
*NL*
have
lain
quietly
under
peril
of
his
malediction
,
the
bones
of
the
great
*NL*
Spanish
poet
were
irrevocably
lost
when
the
old
Convent
of
the
Trinity
,
*NL*
in
the
Calle
del
Humilladero
,
was
destroyed
.
Ungrateful
Spain
!
the
spot
*NL*
had
never
been
marked
with
a
common
tombstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
house
-LSB-

-RSB-
in
the
Calle
de
Francos
,
where
he
died
,
was
so
*NL*
dilapidated
that
,
in
1835
,
it
was
destroyed
.
It
was
rebuilt
,
and
a
*NL*
marble
bust
of
Cervantes
was
placed
over
the
entrance
by
the
sculptor
,
*NL*
Antonio
Sola
.

*NL*
The
``
Madrid
Epoca
,
''
under
the
heading
of
``
The
Prison
of
Cervantes
,
''
*NL*
calls
attention
to
the
alarming
state
of
decay
of
the
house
in
*NL*
Argamasilla
del
Alba
,
in
the
cellar
of
which
,
as
an
extemporized
*NL*
dungeon
,
tradition
asserts
that
Cervantes
was
imprisoned
,
and
where
he
*NL*
penned
at
least
a
portion
of
his
work
.
It
was
in
this
cellar
that
,
a
few
*NL*
years
since
,
the
Madrid
publishing
house
of
Rivadeneyra
erected
a
press
*NL*
and
printed
their
edition
_
de
luxe
_
of
``
Don
Quijote
.
''
The
house
was
,
*NL*
some
years
since
,
purchased
by
the
late
Infante
Don
Sebastian
,
with
a
*NL*
view
to
a
complete
and
careful
restoration
;
but
political
changes
and
*NL*
his
death
prevented
a
realization
of
his
project
.
The
``
Epoca
''
now
calls
*NL*
public
attention
to
the
state
of
decay
of
the
house
,
with
a
view
to
an
*NL*
immediate
restoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Plaza
de
las
Cortes
,
the
city
of
Madrid
has
placed
a
beautiful
*NL*
bronze
statue
of
Cervantes
upon
a
square
pedestal
of
granite
.
Upon
the
*NL*
sides
are
bas-reliefs
representing
subjects
taken
from
``
Don
Quijote
de
*NL*
la

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
present
time
honors
his
memory
;
and
for
all
time
he
will
live
in
the
*NL*
hearts
of
all
true
lovers
of
genius

WIT
AND
WISDOM
*NL*
*NL*
OF
*NL*
*NL*
DON
QUIXOTE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Down
in
a
village
of
La
Mancha
,
the
name
of
which
I
have
no
desire
to
*NL*
recollect
,
there
lived
,
not
long
ago
,
one
of
those
gentlemen
who
usually
*NL*
keep
a
lance
upon
a
rack
,
an
old
buckler
,
a
lean
horse
,
and
a
coursing
*NL*
grayhound
.
Soup
,
composed
of
somewhat
more
mutton
than
beef
,
the
*NL*
fragments
served
up
cold
on
most
nights
,
lentils
on
Fridays
,
collops
and
*NL*
eggs
on
Saturdays
,
and
a
pigeon
by
way
of
addition
on
Sundays
,
consumed
*NL*
three-fourths
of
his
income
;
the
remainder
of
it
supplied
him
with
a
*NL*
cloak
of
fine
cloth
,
velvet
breeches
,
with
slippers
of
the
same
for
*NL*
holidays
,
and
a
suit
of
the
best
homespun
,
in
which
he
adorned
himself
*NL*
on
week-days
.
His
family
consisted
of
a
housekeeper
above
forty
,
a
niece
*NL*
not
quite
twenty
,
and
a
lad
who
served
him
both
in
the
field
and
at
*NL*
home
,
who
could
saddle
the
horse
or
handle
the
pruning-hook
.
The
age
of
*NL*
our
gentleman
bordered
upon
fifty
years
:
he
was
of
a
strong
*NL*
constitution
,
spare-bodied
,
of
a
meagre
visage
,
a
very
early
riser
,
and
*NL*
a
lover
of
the
chase
.
Some
pretend
to
say
that
his
surname
was
Quixada
*NL*
or
Quesada
,
for
on
this
point
his
historians
differ
;
though
,
from
very
*NL*
probable
conjectures
,
we
may
conclude
that
his
name
was
Quixana
.
This
*NL*
is
,
however
,
of
little
importance
to
our
history
;
let
it
suffice
that
,
*NL*
in
relating
it
,
we
do
not
swerve
a
jot
from
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fine
,
his
judgment
being
completely
obscured
,
he
was
seized
with
one
*NL*
of
the
strangest
fancies
that
ever
entered
the
head
of
any
madman
;
this
*NL*
was
,
a
belief
that
it
behooved
him
,
as
well
for
the
advancement
of
his
*NL*
glory
as
the
service
of
his
country
,
to
become
a
knight-errant
,
and
*NL*
traverse
the
world
,
armed
and
mounted
,
in
quest
of
adventures
,
and
to
*NL*
practice
all
that
had
been
performed
by
knights-errant
of
whom
he
had
*NL*
read
;
redressing
every
species
of
grievance
,
and
exposing
himself
to
*NL*
dangers
,
which
,
being
surmounted
,
might
secure
to
him
eternal
glory
and
*NL*
renown
.
The
poor
gentleman
imagined
himself
at
least
crowned
Emperor
of
*NL*
Trebisond
,
by
the
valor
of
his
arm
;
and
thus
wrapped
in
these
agreeable
*NL*
delusions
and
borne
away
by
the
extraordinary
pleasure
he
found
in
them
,
*NL*
he
hastened
to
put
his
designs
into
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
he
did
was
to
scour
up
some
rusty
armor
which
had
been
*NL*
his
great-grandfather
's
,
and
had
lain
many
years
neglected
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
This
he
cleaned
and
adjusted
as
well
as
he
could
;
but
he
found
one
grand
*NL*
defect
,
--
the
helmet
was
incomplete
,
having
only
the
morion
.
This
*NL*
deficiency
,
however
,
he
ingeniously
supplied
by
making
a
kind
of
visor
*NL*
of
pasteboard
,
which
,
being
fixed
to
the
morion
,
gave
the
appearance
of
*NL*
an
entire
helmet
.
It
is
true
,
indeed
,
that
,
in
order
to
prove
its
*NL*
strength
,
he
drew
his
sword
,
and
gave
it
two
strokes
,
the
first
of
which
*NL*
instantly
demolished
the
labor
of
a
week
;
but
not
altogether
approving
*NL*
of
the
facility
with
which
it
was
destroyed
,
and
in
order
to
secure
*NL*
himself
against
a
similar
misfortune
,
he
made
another
visor
,
which
,
*NL*
having
fenced
in
the
inside
with
small
bars
of
iron
,
he
felt
assured
of
*NL*
its
strength
,
and
,
without
making
any
more
experiments
,
held
it
to
be
a
*NL*
most
excellent
helmet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
next
place
he
visited
his
steed
;
and
although
this
animal
had
*NL*
more
blemishes
than
the
horse
of
Gonela
,
which
,
''
_
tantum
pellis
et
ossa
*NL*
fuit
_
,
''
yet
,
in
his
eyes
,
neither
the
Bucephalus
of
Alexander
nor
the
*NL*
Cid
's
Babieca
,
could
be
compared
with
him
.
Four
days
was
he
deliberating
*NL*
upon
what
name
he
should
give
him
;
for
,
as
he
said
to
himself
,
it
would
*NL*
be
very
improper
that
a
horse
so
excellent
,
appertaining
to
a
knight
so
*NL*
famous
,
should
be
without
an
appropriate
name
;
he
therefore
endeavored
*NL*
to
find
one
that
should
express
what
he
had
been
before
he
belonged
to
a
*NL*
knight-errant
,
and
also
what
he
now
was
:
nothing
could
,
indeed
,
be
more
*NL*
reasonable
than
that
,
when
the
master
changed
his
state
,
the
horse
*NL*
should
likewise
change
his
name
and
assume
one
pompous
and
*NL*
high-sounding
,
as
became
the
new
order
he
now
professed
.
So
,
after
*NL*
having
devised
,
altered
,
lengthened
,
curtailed
,
rejected
,
and
again
*NL*
framed
in
his
imagination
a
variety
of
names
,
he
finally
determined
upon
*NL*
Rozinante
,
a
name
in
his
opinion
lofty
,
sonorous
,
and
full
of
meaning
;
*NL*
importing
that
he
had
only
been
a
rozin
--
a
drudge
horse
--
before
his
*NL*
present
condition
,
and
that
now
he
was
before
all
the
rozins
in
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
given
his
horse
a
name
so
much
to
his
satisfaction
,
he
resolved
*NL*
to
fix
upon
one
for
himself
.
This
consideration
employed
him
eight
more
*NL*
days
,
when
at
length
he
determined
to
call
himself
Don
Quixote
;
whence
*NL*
some
of
the
historians
of
this
most
true
history
have
concluded
that
his
*NL*
name
was
certainly
Quixada
,
and
not
Quesada
,
as
others
would
have
it
.
*NL*
Then
recollecting
that
the
valorous
Amadis
,
not
content
with
the
simple
*NL*
appellation
of
Amadis
,
added
thereto
the
name
of
his
kingdom
and
native
*NL*
country
,
in
order
to
render
it
famous
,
styling
himself
Amadis
de
Gaul
;
*NL*
so
he
,
like
a
good
knight
,
also
added
the
name
of
his
province
,
and
*NL*
called
himself
Don
Quixote
de
la
Mancha
;
whereby
,
in
his
opinion
,
he
*NL*
fully
proclaimed
his
lineage
and
country
,
which
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
*NL*
honored
by
taking
its
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
armor
being
now
furbished
,
his
helmet
made
perfect
,
his
horse
and
*NL*
himself
provided
with
names
,
he
found
nothing
wanting
but
a
lady
to
be
*NL*
in
love
with
,
as
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
knight-errant
without
a
mistress
was
a
tree
without
either
fruit
or
*NL*
leaves
,
and
a
body
without
a
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
before
day
,
being
one
of
the
most
sultry
in
the
month
of
*NL*
July
,
he
armed
himself
cap-a-pie
,
mounted
Rozinante
,
placed
the
helmet
*NL*
on
his
head
,
braced
on
his
target
,
took
his
lance
,
and
,
through
the
*NL*
private
gate
of
his
back
yard
,
issued
forth
into
the
open
plain
,
in
a
*NL*
transport
of
joy
to
think
he
had
met
with
no
obstacles
to
the
*NL*
commencement
of
his
honorable
enterprise
.
But
scarce
had
he
found
*NL*
himself
on
the
plain
when
he
was
assailed
by
a
recollection
so
terrible
*NL*
as
almost
to
make
him
abandon
the
undertaking
;
for
it
just
then
occurred
*NL*
to
him
that
he
was
not
yet
dubbed
a
knight
;
therefore
,
in
conformity
to
*NL*
the
laws
of
chivalry
,
he
neither
could
nor
ought
to
enter
the
lists
*NL*
against
any
of
that
order
;
and
,
if
he
had
been
actually
dubbed
he
*NL*
should
,
as
a
new
knight
,
have
worn
white
armor
,
without
any
device
on
*NL*
his
shield
,
until
he
had
gained
one
by
force
of
arms
.
These
*NL*
considerations
made
him
irresolute
whether
to
proceed
,
but
frenzy
*NL*
prevailing
over
reason
,
he
determined
to
get
himself
made
a
knight
by
*NL*
the
first
one
he
should
meet
,
like
many
others
of
whom
he
had
read
.
As
*NL*
to
white
armor
,
he
resolved
,
when
he
had
an
opportunity
,
to
scour
his
*NL*
own
,
so
that
it
should
be
whiter
than
ermine
.
Having
now
composed
his
*NL*
mind
,
he
proceeded
,
taking
whatever
road
his
horse
pleased
;
for
therein
,
*NL*
he
believed
,
consisted
the
true
spirit
of
adventure
.
Everything
that
our
*NL*
adventurer
saw
and
conceived
was
,
by
his
imagination
,
moulded
to
what
he
*NL*
had
read
;
so
in
his
eyes
the
inn
appeared
to
be
a
castle
,
with
its
four
*NL*
turrets
,
and
pinnacles
of
shining
silver
,
together
with
its
drawbridge
,
*NL*
deep
moat
,
and
all
the
appurtenances
with
which
such
castles
are
*NL*
visually
described
.
When
he
had
advanced
within
a
short
distance
of
it
,
*NL*
he
checked
Rozinante
,
expecting
some
dwarf
would
mount
the
battlements
,
*NL*
to
announce
by
sound
of
trumpet
the
arrival
of
a
knight-errant
at
the
*NL*
castle
;
but
,
finding
them
tardy
,
and
Rozinante
impatient
for
the
*NL*
stable
,
he
approached
the
inn-door
,
and
there
saw
the
two
girls
,
who
to
*NL*
him
appeared
to
be
beautiful
damsels
or
lovely
dames
enjoying
themselves
*NL*
before
the
gate
of
their
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
that
,
just
at
this
time
,
a
swineherd
collecting
his
hogs
-LRB-
I
*NL*
make
no
apology
,
for
so
they
are
called
-RRB-
from
an
adjoining
stubblefield
,
*NL*
blew
the
horn
which
assembles
them
together
,
and
instantly
Don
Quixote
*NL*
was
satisfied
,
for
he
imagined
it
was
a
dwarf
who
had
given
the
signal
*NL*
of
his
arrival
.
With
extraordinary
satisfaction
,
therefore
,
he
went
up
*NL*
to
the
inn
;
upon
which
the
ladies
,
being
startled
at
the
sight
of
a
man
*NL*
armed
in
that
manner
,
with
lance
and
buckler
,
were
retreating
into
the
*NL*
house
;
but
Don
Quixote
,
perceiving
their
alarm
,
raised
his
pasteboard
*NL*
visor
,
thereby
partly
discovering
his
meagre
,
dusty
visage
,
and
with
*NL*
gentle
demeanor
and
placid
voice
,
thus
addressed
them
:
``
Fly
not
,
ladies
,
*NL*
nor
fear
any
discourtesy
,
for
it
would
be
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
*NL*
order
of
knighthood
,
which
I
profess
,
to
offer
insult
to
any
person
,
*NL*
much
less
to
virgins
of
that
exalted
rank
which
your
appearance
*NL*
indicates
.
''
The
girls
stared
at
him
,
and
were
endeavoring
to
find
out
*NL*
his
face
,
which
was
almost
concealed
by
the
sorry
visor
;
but
hearing
*NL*
themselves
called
virgins
,
they
could
not
forbear
laughing
,
and
to
such
*NL*
a
degree
that
Don
Quixote
was
displeased
,
and
said
to
them
:
``
Modesty
*NL*
well
becomes
beauty
,
and
excessive
laughter
proceeding
from
slight
cause
*NL*
is
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
language
,
so
unintelligible
to
the
ladies
,
added
to
the
uncouth
*NL*
figure
of
our
knight
,
increased
their
laughter
;
consequently
he
grew
*NL*
more
indignant
,
and
would
have
proceeded
further
but
for
the
timely
*NL*
appearance
of
the
innkeeper
,
a
very
corpulent
and
therefore
a
very
*NL*
pacific
man
,
who
,
upon
seeing
so
ludicrous
an
object
,
armed
,
and
with
*NL*
accoutrements
so
ill-sorted
as
were
the
bridle
,
lance
,
buckler
,
and
*NL*
corselet
,
felt
disposed
to
join
the
damsels
in
demonstrations
of
mirth
;
*NL*
but
,
in
truth
,
apprehending
some
danger
from
a
form
thus
strongly
*NL*
fortified
,
he
resolved
to
behave
with
civility
,
and
therefore
said
,
``
If
,
*NL*
Sir
Knight
,
you
are
seeking
for
a
lodging
,
you
will
here
find
,
excepting
*NL*
a
bed
-LRB-
for
there
are
none
in
this
inn
-RRB-
,
everything
in
abundance
.
''
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
perceiving
the
humility
of
the
governor
of
the
fortress
,
--
for
*NL*
such
to
him
appeared
the
innkeeper
,
--
answered
,
``
For
me
,
Signor
*NL*
Castellano
,
anything
will
suffice
,
since
arms
are
my
ornaments
,
warfare
*NL*
my
repose
.
''
The
host
thought
he
called
him
Castellano
because
he
took
*NL*
him
for
a
sound
Castilian
,
whereas
he
was
an
Andalusian
of
the
coast
of
*NL*
St.
Lucar
,
as
great
a
thief
as
Cacus
and
not
less
mischievous
than
a
*NL*
collegian
or
a
page
;
and
he
replied
,
``
If
so
,
your
worship
's
beds
must
be
*NL*
hard
rocks
,
and
your
sleep
continual
watching
;
and
that
being
the
case
,
*NL*
you
may
dismount
with
a
certainty
of
finding
here
sufficient
cause
for
*NL*
keeping
awake
the
whole
year
,
much
more
a
single
night
.
''
So
saying
,
he
*NL*
laid
hold
of
Don
Quixote
's
stirrup
,
who
alighted
with
much
difficulty
*NL*
and
pain
,
for
he
had
fasted
the
whole
of
the
day
.
He
then
desired
the
*NL*
host
to
take
especial
care
of
his
steed
,
for
it
was
the
finest
creature
*NL*
ever
fed
;
the
innkeeper
examined
him
,
but
thought
him
not
so
good
by
*NL*
half
as
his
master
had
represented
him
.
Having
led
the
horse
to
the
*NL*
stable
he
returned
to
receive
the
orders
of
his
guest
,
whom
the
damsels
,
*NL*
being
now
reconciled
to
him
,
were
disarming
;
they
had
taken
off
the
back
*NL*
and
breast
plates
,
but
endeavored
in
vain
to
disengage
the
gorget
,
or
*NL*
take
off
the
counterfeit
beaver
,
which
he
had
fastened
with
green
*NL*
ribbons
in
such
a
manner
that
they
could
not
be
untied
,
and
he
would
*NL*
upon
no
account
allow
them
to
be
cut
;
therefore
he
remained
all
that
*NL*
night
with
his
helmet
on
,
the
strangest
and
most
ridiculous
figure
*NL*
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
light
girls
,
whom
he
still
conceived
to
be
persons
of
*NL*
quality
and
ladies
of
the
castle
,
were
disarming
him
,
he
said
to
them
,
*NL*
with
infinite
grace
:
``
Never
before
was
knight
so
honored
by
ladies
as
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
after
his
departure
from
his
native
village
!
damsels
*NL*
attended
upon
him
;
princesses
took
charge
of
his
steed
!
O
*NL*
Rosinante
,
--
for
that
,
ladies
,
is
the
name
of
my
horse
,
and
Don
Quixote
*NL*
de
la
Mancha
my
own
;
although
it
was
not
my
intention
to
have
discovered
*NL*
myself
until
deeds
performed
in
your
service
should
have
proclaimed
me
;
*NL*
but
impelled
to
make
so
just
an
application
of
that
ancient
romance
of
*NL*
Lanzarote
to
my
present
situation
,
I
have
thus
prematurely
disclosed
my
*NL*
name
:
yet
the
time
shall
come
when
your
ladyships
may
command
,
and
I
*NL*
obey
;
when
the
valor
of
my
arm
shall
make
manifest
the
desire
I
have
to
*NL*
serve
you
.
''
The
girls
,
unaccustomed
to
such
rhetorical
flourishes
,
made
*NL*
no
reply
,
but
asked
whether
he
would
please
to
eat
anything
.
``
I
shall
*NL*
willingly
take
some
food
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
I
apprehend
it
*NL*
would
be
of
much
service
to
me
.
''
That
day
happened
to
be
Friday
,
and
*NL*
there
was
nothing
in
the
house
but
some
fish
of
that
kind
which
in
*NL*
Castile
is
called
Abadexo
;
in
Andalusia
,
Bacallao
;
in
some
parts
,
*NL*
Curadillo
:
and
in
others
,
Truchuela
.
They
asked
if
his
worship
would
*NL*
like
some
truchuela
,
for
they
had
no
other
fish
to
offer
him
.
``
If
there
*NL*
be
many
troutlings
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
they
will
supply
the
place
of
*NL*
one
trout
;
for
it
is
the
same
to
me
whether
I
receive
eight
single
rials
*NL*
or
one
piece-of-eight
.
Moreover
,
these
troutlings
may
be
preferable
,
as
*NL*
veal
is
better
than
beef
,
and
kid
superior
to
goat
.
Be
that
as
it
may
,
*NL*
let
it
come
immediately
,
for
the
toil
and
weight
of
arms
can
not
be
*NL*
sustained
by
the
body
unless
the
interior
be
supplied
with
aliments
.
''
*NL*
For
the
benefit
of
the
cool
air
,
they
placed
the
table
at
the
door
of
*NL*
the
inn
,
and
the
landlord
produced
some
of
his
ill-soaked
and
*NL*
worse-cooked
bacallao
,
with
bread
as
foul
and
black
as
the
knight
's
*NL*
armor
.
But
it
was
a
spectacle
highly
risible
to
see
him
eat
;
for
his
*NL*
hands
being
engaged
in
holding
his
helmet
on
and
raising
the
beaver
,
he
*NL*
could
not
feed
himself
,
therefore
one
of
the
ladies
performed
that
*NL*
office
for
him
;
but
to
drink
would
have
been
utterly
impossible
had
not
*NL*
the
innkeeper
bored
a
reed
,
and
placing
one
end
into
his
mouth
at
the
*NL*
other
poured
in
the
wine
;
and
all
this
he
patiently
endured
rather
than
*NL*
cut
the
lacings
of
his
helmet
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
PLEASANT
METHOD
DON
QUIXOTE
TOOK
TO
BE
*NL*
DUBBED
A
KNIGHT
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
troubled
him
to
reflect
that
he
was
not
yet
a
knight
,
feeling
*NL*
persuaded
that
he
could
not
lawfully
engage
in
any
adventure
until
he
*NL*
had
been
invested
with
the
order
of
knighthood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agitated
by
this
idea
,
he
abruptly
finished
his
scanty
supper
,
called
*NL*
the
innkeeper
,
and
,
shutting
himself
up
with
him
in
the
stable
,
he
fell
*NL*
on
his
knees
before
him
and
said
,
``
Never
will
I
arise
from
this
place
,
*NL*
valorous
knight
,
until
your
courtesy
shall
vouchsafe
to
grant
a
boon
*NL*
which
it
is
my
intention
to
request
,
--
a
boon
that
will
redound
to
your
*NL*
glory
and
to
the
benefit
of
all
mankind
.
''
The
innkeeper
,
seeing
his
*NL*
guest
at
his
feet
and
hearing
such
language
,
stood
confounded
and
stared
*NL*
at
him
without
knowing
what
to
do
or
say
;
he
entreated
him
to
rise
,
but
*NL*
in
vain
,
until
he
had
promised
to
grant
the
boon
he
requested
.
``
I
*NL*
expected
no
less
,
signor
,
from
your
great
magnificence
,
''
replied
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
``
know
,
therefore
,
that
the
boon
I
have
demanded
,
and
which
your
*NL*
liberality
has
conceded
,
is
that
on
the
morrow
you
will
confer
upon
me
*NL*
the
honor
of
knighthood
.
This
night
I
will
watch
my
arms
in
the
chapel
*NL*
of
your
castle
,
in
order
that
,
in
the
morning
,
my
earnest
desire
may
be
*NL*
fulfilled
and
I
may
with
propriety
traverse
the
four
quarters
of
the
*NL*
world
in
quest
of
adventures
for
the
relief
of
the
distressed
,
*NL*
conformable
to
the
duties
of
chivalry
and
of
knights-errant
,
who
,
like
*NL*
myself
,
are
devoted
to
such
pursuits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
,
who
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
a
shrewd
fellow
,
and
had
already
*NL*
entertained
some
doubts
respecting
the
wits
of
his
guest
,
was
now
*NL*
confirmed
in
his
suspicions
;
and
to
make
sport
for
the
night
,
determined
*NL*
to
follow
his
humor
.
He
told
him
,
therefore
,
that
his
desire
was
very
*NL*
reasonable
,
and
that
such
pursuits
were
natural
and
suitable
to
knights
*NL*
so
illustrious
as
he
appeared
to
be
,
and
as
his
gallant
demeanor
fully
*NL*
testified
;
that
he
had
himself
in
the
days
of
his
youth
followed
that
*NL*
honorable
profession
,
and
travelled
over
various
parts
of
the
world
in
*NL*
search
of
adventures
;
failing
not
to
visit
the
suburbs
of
Malaga
,
the
*NL*
isles
of
Riaran
,
the
compass
of
Seville
,
the
market-place
of
Segovia
,
*NL*
the
olive-field
of
Valencia
,
the
rondilla
of
Grenada
,
the
coast
of
St.
*NL*
Lucar
,
the
fountain
of
Cordova
,
the
taverns
of
Toledo
,
and
divers
other
*NL*
parts
,
where
he
had
exercised
the
agility
of
his
heels
and
the
dexterity
*NL*
of
his
hands
;
committing
sundry
wrongs
,
soliciting
widows
,
seducing
*NL*
damsels
,
cheating
youths
,
--
in
short
,
making
himself
known
to
most
of
the
*NL*
tribunals
in
Spain
;
and
that
,
finally
,
he
had
retired
to
this
castle
,
*NL*
where
he
lived
upon
his
revenue
and
that
of
others
,
entertaining
therein
*NL*
all
knights-errant
of
every
quality
and
degree
solely
for
the
great
*NL*
affection
he
bore
them
,
and
that
they
might
share
their
fortune
with
him
*NL*
in
return
for
his
good
will
.
He
further
told
him
that
in
his
castle
*NL*
there
was
no
chapel
wherein
he
could
watch
his
armor
,
for
it
had
been
*NL*
pulled
down
in
order
to
be
rebuilt
;
but
that
,
in
cases
of
necessity
,
he
*NL*
knew
it
might
be
done
wherever
he
pleased
.
Therefore
,
he
might
watch
it
*NL*
that
night
in
a
court
of
the
castle
,
and
the
following
morning
,
if
it
*NL*
pleased
God
,
the
requisite
ceremonies
should
be
performed
,
and
he
should
*NL*
be
dubbed
so
effectually
that
the
world
would
not
be
able
to
produce
a
*NL*
more
perfect
knight
.
He
then
inquired
if
he
had
any
money
about
him
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
told
him
he
had
none
,
having
never
read
in
their
histories
that
*NL*
knights-errant
provided
themselves
with
money
.
The
innkeeper
assured
*NL*
him
he
was
mistaken
;
for
,
admitting
that
it
was
not
mentioned
in
their
*NL*
history
,
the
authors
deeming
it
unnecessary
to
specify
things
so
*NL*
obviously
requisite
as
money
and
clean
shirts
,
yet
was
it
not
therefore
*NL*
to
be
inferred
that
they
had
none
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
might
*NL*
consider
it
as
an
established
fact
that
all
knights-errant
,
of
whose
*NL*
histories
so
many
volumes
are
filled
,
carried
their
purses
well
provided
*NL*
against
accidents
;
that
they
were
also
supplied
with
shirts
,
and
a
small
*NL*
casket
of
ointments
to
heal
the
wounds
they
might
receive
,
for
in
plains
*NL*
and
deserts
,
where
they
fought
and
were
wounded
,
no
aid
was
near
unless
*NL*
they
had
some
sage
enchanter
for
their
friend
,
who
could
give
them
*NL*
immediate
assistance
by
conveying
in
cloud
through
the
air
some
damsel
*NL*
or
dwarf
,
with
a
phial
of
water
possessed
of
such
virtue
that
,
upon
*NL*
tasting
a
single
drop
of
it
,
they
should
instantly
become
as
sound
as
if
*NL*
they
had
received
no
injury
.
But
when
the
knights
of
former
times
were
*NL*
without
such
a
friend
,
they
always
took
care
that
their
esquires
should
*NL*
be
provided
with
money
and
such
necessary
articles
as
lint
and
salves
;
*NL*
and
when
they
had
no
esquires
--
which
very
rarely
happened
--
they
carried
*NL*
these
things
themselves
upon
the
crupper
of
their
horse
,
in
wallets
so
*NL*
small
as
to
be
scarcely
visible
,
that
they
might
seem
to
be
something
of
*NL*
more
importance
;
for
,
except
in
such
cases
,
the
custom
of
carrying
*NL*
wallets
was
not
tolerated
among
knights-errant
.
He
therefore
advised
,
*NL*
though
,
as
his
godson
-LRB-
which
he
was
soon
to
be
-RRB-
,
he
might
command
him
,
*NL*
never
henceforth
to
travel
without
money
and
the
aforesaid
provisions
,
*NL*
and
he
would
find
them
serviceable
when
he
least
expected
it
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
promised
to
follow
his
advice
with
punctuality
:
and
an
order
was
*NL*
now
given
for
performing
the
watch
of
the
armor
in
a
large
yard
*NL*
adjoining
the
inn
.
Don
Quixote
,
having
collected
it
together
placed
it
*NL*
on
a
cistern
which
was
close
to
a
well
;
then
,
bracing
on
his
target
and
*NL*
grasping
his
lance
,
with
graceful
demeanor
he
paced
to
and
fro
before
*NL*
the
pile
,
beginning
his
parade
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
innkeeper
informed
all
who
were
in
the
inn
of
the
frenzy
of
his
*NL*
guest
,
the
watching
of
his
armor
,
and
of
the
intended
knighting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
repeated
to
him
that
there
was
no
chapel
in
the
castle
,
nor
was
*NL*
it
by
any
means
necessary
for
what
remained
to
be
done
;
that
the
stroke
*NL*
of
knighting
consisted
in
blows
on
the
neck
and
shoulders
,
according
to
*NL*
the
ceremonial
of
the
order
,
which
might
be
effectually
performed
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
field
;
that
the
duty
of
watching
his
armor
he
had
now
*NL*
completely
fulfilled
,
for
he
had
watched
more
than
four
hours
,
though
*NL*
only
two
were
required
.
All
this
Don
Quixote
believed
,
and
said
that
he
*NL*
was
there
ready
to
obey
him
,
requesting
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
to
*NL*
perform
the
deed
as
soon
as
possible
;
because
,
should
he
be
assaulted
*NL*
again
when
he
found
himself
knighted
,
he
was
resolved
not
to
leave
one
*NL*
person
alive
in
the
castle
,
excepting
those
whom
,
out
of
respect
to
him
,
*NL*
and
at
his
particular
request
,
he
might
be
induced
to
spare
.
The
*NL*
constable
,
thus
warned
and
alarmed
,
immediately
brought
forth
a
book
in
*NL*
which
he
kept
his
account
of
the
straw
and
oats
he
furnished
to
the
*NL*
carriers
,
and
attended
by
a
boy
,
who
carried
an
end
of
candle
,
and
the
*NL*
two
damsels
before
mentioned
,
went
towards
Don
Quixote
,
whom
he
*NL*
commanded
to
kneel
down
;
he
then
began
reading
in
his
manual
,
as
if
it
*NL*
were
some
devout
prayer
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
raised
his
hand
and
*NL*
gave
him
a
good
blow
on
the
neck
,
and
,
after
that
,
a
handsome
stroke
*NL*
over
the
shoulders
,
with
his
own
sword
,
still
muttering
between
his
*NL*
teeth
,
as
if
in
prayer
.
This
being
done
,
he
commanded
one
of
the
ladies
*NL*
to
gird
on
his
sword
,
an
office
she
performed
with
much
alacrity
,
as
*NL*
well
as
discretion
,
no
small
portion
of
which
was
necessary
to
avoid
*NL*
bursting
with
laughter
at
every
part
of
the
ceremony
;
but
indeed
the
*NL*
prowess
they
had
seen
displayed
by
the
new
knight
kept
their
mirth
*NL*
within
bounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
girding
on
the
sword
,
the
good
lady
said
:
``
God
grant
you
may
be
a
*NL*
fortunate
knight
and
successful
in
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
inquired
her
name
,
that
he
might
thenceforward
know
to
whom
*NL*
he
was
indebted
for
the
favor
received
,
as
it
was
his
intention
to
*NL*
bestow
upon
her
some
share
of
the
honor
he
should
acquire
by
the
valor
*NL*
of
his
arm
.
She
replied
,
with
much
humility
,
that
her
name
was
Tolosa
,
*NL*
and
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
cobbler
at
Toledo
,
who
lived
at
the
*NL*
stalls
of
Sanchobienaya
;
and
that
,
wherever
she
was
,
she
would
serve
and
*NL*
honor
him
as
her
lord
.
Don
Quixote
,
in
reply
,
requested
her
,
for
his
*NL*
sake
,
to
do
him
the
favor
henceforth
to
add
to
her
name
the
title
of
*NL*
don
,
and
call
herself
Donna
Tolosa
,
which
she
promised
to
do
.
The
other
*NL*
girl
now
buckled
on
his
spur
,
and
with
her
he
held
nearly
the
same
*NL*
conference
as
with
the
lady
of
the
sword
;
having
inquired
her
name
,
she
*NL*
told
him
it
was
Molinera
,
and
that
she
was
daughter
to
an
honest
miller
*NL*
of
Antiquera
:
he
then
requested
her
likewise
to
assume
the
don
,
and
*NL*
style
herself
Donna
Molinera
,
renewing
his
proffers
of
service
and
*NL*
thanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
never-till-then-seen
ceremonies
being
thus
speedily
performed
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
impatient
to
find
himself
on
horseback
,
in
quest
of
*NL*
adventures
.
He
therefore
instantly
saddled
Rozinante
,
mounted
him
,
and
,
*NL*
embracing
his
host
,
made
his
acknowledgments
for
the
favor
he
had
*NL*
conferred
by
knighting
him
,
in
terms
so
extraordinary
,
that
it
would
be
*NL*
in
vain
to
attempt
to
repeat
them
.
The
host
,
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
*NL*
the
sooner
,
replied
,
with
no
less
flourish
,
but
more
brevity
;
and
,
*NL*
without
making
any
demand
for
his
lodging
,
wished
him
a
good
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tongue
slow
and
the
eyes
quick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keep
your
mouth
shut
and
your
eyes
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brave
man
carves
out
his
own
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
full
of
pain
,
yet
soon
as
he
was
able
to
stir
,
he
began
to
roll
*NL*
himself
on
the
ground
,
and
to
repeat
,
in
what
they
affirm
was
said
by
*NL*
the
wounded
knight
of
the
wood
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
art
thou
,
mistress
of
my
heart
,
*NL*
Unconscious
of
thy
lover
's
smart
?
*NL*
Ah
me
!
thou
know
`
st
not
my
distress
,
*NL*
Or
thou
art
false
and
pitiless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
who
I
am
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
I
know
,
too
,
that
I
am
not
*NL*
only
capable
of
being
those
I
have
mentioned
,
but
all
the
twelve
peers
*NL*
of
France
,
yea
,
and
the
nine
worthies
,
since
my
exploits
will
far
exceed
*NL*
all
that
they
have
jointly
or
separately
achieved

*NL*
*NL*
DESTRUCTION
OF
DON
QUIXOTE
'S
LIBRARY
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
and
heavy
was
the
sleep
of
Don
Quixote
:
meanwhile
the
priest
having
*NL*
asked
the
niece
for
the
key
of
the
chamber
containing
the
books
,
those
*NL*
authors
of
the
mischief
,
which
she
delivered
with
a
very
good
will
,
they
*NL*
entered
,
attended
by
the
housekeeper
,
and
found
above
a
hundred
large
*NL*
volumes
well
bound
,
besides
a
great
number
of
smaller
size
.
No
sooner
*NL*
did
the
housekeeper
see
them
than
she
ran
out
of
the
room
in
great
*NL*
haste
,
and
immediately
returned
with
a
pot
of
holy
water
and
a
bunch
of
*NL*
hyssop
,
saying
:
``
Signor
Licentiate
,
take
this
and
sprinkle
the
room
,
*NL*
lest
some
enchanter
of
the
many
that
these
books
abound
with
should
*NL*
enchant
us
,
as
a
punishment
for
our
intention
to
banish
them
out
of
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
smiled
at
the
housekeeper
's
simplicity
,
and
ordered
the
*NL*
barber
to
reach
him
the
books
one
by
one
,
that
they
might
see
what
they
*NL*
treated
of
,
as
they
might
perhaps
find
some
that
deserved
not
to
be
*NL*
chastised
by
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
niece
,
``
there
is
no
reason
why
any
of
them
should
be
*NL*
spared
,
for
they
have
all
been
mischief-makers
:
so
let
them
all
be
*NL*
thrown
out
of
the
window
into
the
courtyard
;
and
having
made
a
pile
of
*NL*
them
,
set
fire
to
it
;
or
else
make
a
bonfire
of
them
in
the
back
yard
,
*NL*
where
the
smoke
will
offend
nobody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
housekeeper
said
the
same
,
so
eagerly
did
they
both
thirst
for
the
*NL*
death
of
those
innocents
.
But
the
priest
would
not
consent
to
it
without
*NL*
first
reading
the
titles
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
that
Master
Nicholas
put
into
his
hands
was
``
Amadis
de
Gaul
,
''
*NL*
in
four
parts
;
and
the
priest
said
:
``
There
seems
to
be
some
mystery
in
*NL*
this
,
for
I
have
heard
say
that
this
was
the
first
book
of
chivalry
*NL*
printed
in
Spain
,
and
that
all
the
rest
had
their
foundation
and
rise
*NL*
from
it
;
I
think
,
therefore
,
as
head
of
so
pernicious
a
sect
,
we
ought
*NL*
to
condemn
him
to
the
fire
without
mercy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
''
said
the
barber
;
``
for
I
have
heard
also
that
it
is
the
best
of
*NL*
all
the
books
of
this
kind
:
therefore
,
as
being
unequalled
in
its
way
,
*NL*
it
ought
to
be
spared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
and
for
that
reason
its
life
is
*NL*
granted
for
the
present
.
Let
us
see
that
other
next
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
the
`
Adventures
of
Esplandian
,
'
the
*NL*
legitimate
son
of
`
Amadis
de
Gaul
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Verily
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
the
goodness
of
the
father
shall
avail
the
*NL*
son
nothing
;
take
him
,
Mistress
Housekeeper
;
open
that
casement
,
and
*NL*
throw
him
into
the
yard
,
and
let
him
make
a
beginning
to
the
pile
for
*NL*
the
intended
bonfire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
housekeeper
did
so
with
much
satisfaction
,
and
good
Esplandian
was
*NL*
sent
flying
into
the
yard
,
there
to
wait
with
patience
for
the
fire
with
*NL*
which
he
was
threatened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed
,
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
is
`
Amadis
of
Greece
;
'
yea
,
and
all
these
*NL*
on
this
side
,
I
believe
,
are
of
the
lineage
of
Amadis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
into
the
yard
with
them
all
!
''
quoth
the
priest
;
``
for
rather
than
*NL*
not
burn
Queen
Pintiquiniestra
,
and
the
shepherd
Darinel
with
his
*NL*
eclogues
,
and
the
devilish
perplexities
of
the
author
,
I
would
burn
the
*NL*
father
who
begot
me
,
were
I
to
meet
him
in
the
shape
of
a
*NL*
knight-errant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
same
opinion

away

handed
them

save
herself
the

threw

all
out

good
truth
I
know
not
which
of

the

the

What

Florismarte
there

the

now

he
shall
soon
make
his

notwithstanding

his
strange
birth

chimerical
adventures

the
harshness

with

executed

done

They
opened
another

found

entitled

Cross

The

taking
down
another

said

my

*NL*
*NL*

I

*NL*
``
Neither
is
it
any

whether
you
understand
him

not

*NL*
answered
the
priest
;
``
and
we
would
willingly
have
excused
the
good
*NL*
captain
from
bringing
him
into
Spain
and
making
him
a
Castilian
;
for
he
*NL*
has
deprived
him
of
a
great
deal
of
his
native
value
;
which
,
indeed
,
is
*NL*
the
misfortune
of
all
those
who
undertake
the
translation
of
poetry
into

other

for

with
all
their
care

skill

they
can
never
*NL*
bring
them
on
a
level
with
the
original
production
.
This
book
,
neighbor
,
*NL*
is
estimable
upon
two
accounts
;
the
one
,
that
it
is
very
good
of
itself
;
*NL*
and
the
other
,
because
there
is
a
tradition
that
it
was
written
by
an
*NL*
ingenious
king
of
Portugal
.
All
the
adventures
of
the
castle
of
*NL*
Miraguarda
are
excellent
,
and
contrived
with
much
art
;
the
dialogue
*NL*
courtly
and
clear
;

all
the
characters
preserved
with
great
judgment
*NL*
and
propriety
.
Therefore
,
Master
Nicholas
,
saving
your
better
judgment
,
*NL*
let
this
and
`
Amadis
de
Gaul
'
be
exempted
from
the
fire
,
and
let
all
the
*NL*
rest
perish
without
any
further
inquiry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
friend
,
''
replied
the
barber
;
``
for
this
which
I
have
here
is
the
*NL*
renowned
`
Don
Bellianis
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
replied
:
``
This
,

the
second
,
third
,

fourth
parts

want
*NL*
a
little
rhubarb
to
purge
away
their
excess
of
bile
;
besides
,
we
must
*NL*
remove
all
that
relates
to
the
castle
of
Fame
,
and
other
absurdities
of
*NL*
greater
consequence
;
for
which
let
sentence
of
transportation
be
passed
*NL*
upon
them
,
and
,
according
as
they
show
signs
of
amendment
,
they
shall
be
*NL*
treated
with
mercy
or
justice
.
In
the

time
,
neighbor

give
them
*NL*
room
in
your
house
;
but
let
them
not
be
read

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
quoth
the
barber
;
and
without
tiring
himself
any
*NL*
farther
in
turning
over
books
of
chivalry
,
bid
the
housekeeper
take
all
*NL*
the
great
ones
and
throw
them
into
the
yard
.
This
was
not
spoken
to
the
*NL*
stupid
or
deaf
,
but
to
one
who
had
a
greater
mind
to
be
burning
them
*NL*
than
weaving
the
finest
and
largest
web
;
and
therefore
,
laying
hold
of
*NL*
seven
or
eight
at
once
,
she
tossed
them
out
at
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
taking
so
many
together
,
one
fell
at
the
barber
's
feet
,
who
had
*NL*
a
mind
to
see
what
it
was
,
and
found
it
to
be
the
history
of
the
*NL*
renowned
knight
Tirante
the
White
.
``
Heaven
save
me
!
''
quoth
the
priest
,
*NL*
with
a
loud
voice
,
``
is
Tirante
the
White
there
?
Give
him
to
me
,
*NL*
neighbor
;
for
in
him
I
shall
have
a
treasure
of
delight
,
and
a
mine
of
*NL*
entertainment
.
Here
we
have
Don
Kyrie-Eleison
of
Montalvan
,
a
valorous
*NL*
knight
,
and
his
brother
Thomas
of
Montalvan
,
with
the
knight
Fonseca
,
*NL*
and
the
combat
which
the
valiant
Tirante
fought
with
the
bull-dog
,
and
*NL*
the
witticisms
of
the
damsel
Plazerdemivida
;
also
the
amours
and
*NL*
artifices
of
the
widow
Reposada
;
and
madam
the
Empress
in
love
with
her
*NL*
squire
Hypolito
.
Verily
,
neighbor
,
in
its
way
it
is
the
best
book
in
the
*NL*
world
:
here
the
knights
eat
and
sleep
,
and
die
in
their
beds
,
and
make
*NL*
their
wills
before
their
deaths
;
with
several
things
which
are
not
to
be
*NL*
found
in
any
other
books
of
this
kind
.
Notwithstanding
this
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
the
author
deserved
,
for
writing
so
many
foolish
things
seriously
,
to
be
*NL*
sent
to
the
galleys
for
the
whole
of
his
life
:
carry
it
home
,
and
read
*NL*
it
,
and
you
will
find
all
I
say
of
him
to
be
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
so
,
''
answered
the
barber
:
``
but
what
shall
we
do
with
these
*NL*
small
volumes
that
remain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
are
,
probably
,
not
books
of
chivalry
,
but
of
*NL*
poetry
.
''
Then
opening
one
he
found
it
was
the
`
Diana
'
of
George
de
*NL*
Montemayor
,
and
,
concluding
that
all
the
others
were
of
the
same
kind
,
*NL*
he
said
,
``
These
do
not
deserve
to
be
burnt
like
the
rest
;
for
they
*NL*
can
not
do
the
mischief
that
those
of
chivalry
have
done
;
they
are
works
*NL*
of
genius
and
fancy
,
and
do
injury
to
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
sir
,
''
said
the
niece
,
``
pray
order
them
to
be
burnt
with
the
rest

*NL*
should
my
uncle
be
cured
of
this
distemper
of
chivalry
,
he
may
possibly
,
*NL*
by
reading
such
books
,
take
it
into
his
head
to
turn
shepherd
,
and
*NL*
wander
through
the
woods
and
fields
,
singing
and
playing
on
a
pipe
;
and
*NL*
what
would
be
still
worse
,
turn
poet
,
which
,
they
say
,
is
an
incurable
*NL*
and
contagious
disease

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
damsel
says
true

quoth
the
priest
,
``
and
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
*NL*
remove
this
stumbling-block
out
of

way

And
,
since
we
begin
*NL*
with
the
`
Diana
'
of
Montemayor
,
my
opinion
is
that
it
should
not
be
*NL*
burnt
,
but
that
all
that
part
should
be
expunged
which
treats
of
the
*NL*
sage
Felicia
,
and
of
the
enchanted
fountain
,
and
also
most
of
the
longer
*NL*
poems
;
leaving
him
,
in
God
's
name
,
the
prose
and
also
the
honor
of
being
*NL*
the
first
in
that
kind
of
writing

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
that
appears

said
the
barber

``
is

second

had
I
ordered
that
book

its
author
was
one
of
the
most
*NL*
celebrated
poets

not
only
of
Spain
,
but
of
the
whole
world

his
*NL*
translations
from

are
admirable

The

night
the
housekeeper
set
fire
to
and
burnt
all
the
books
that
*NL*
were
in
the
yard
and
in
the
house
.
Some
must
have
perished
that
deserved
*NL*
to
be
treasured
up
in
perpetual
archives
,
but
their
destiny
or
the
*NL*
indolence
of
the
scrutineer
forbade
it
;
and
in
them
was
fulfilled
the
*NL*
saying
,
that
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
just
sometimes
suffer
for
the
unjust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mean
time
Don
Quixote
tampered
with
a
laborer
,
a
neighbor
of
his
,
*NL*
and
an
honest
man
-LRB-
if
such
an
epithet
can
be
given
to
one
that
is
poor
-RRB-
,
*NL*
but
shallow
brained
;
in
short
,
he
said
so
much
,
used
so
many
arguments
,
*NL*
and
made
so
many
promises
,
that
the
poor
fellow
resolved
to
sally
out
*NL*
with
him
and
serve
him
in
the
capacity
of
a
squire
.
Among
other
things
,
*NL*
Don
Quixote
told
him
that
he
ought
to
be
very
glad
to
accompany
him
,
for
*NL*
such
an
adventure
might
some
time
or
the
other
occur
,
that
by
one
stroke
*NL*
an
island
might
be
won
,
where
he
might
leave
him
governor
.
With
this
and
*NL*
other
promises
,
Sancho
Panza
-LRB-
for
that
was
the
laborer
's
name
-RRB-
left
his
*NL*
wife
and
children
and
engaged
himself
as
squire
to
his
neighbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
proceeded
upon
his
ass
,
like
a
patriarch
,
with
his
wallet
*NL*
and
leathern
bottle
,
and
with
a
vehement
desire
to
find
himself
*NL*
governor
of
the
island
,
which
his
master
had
promised
him
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
happened
to
take
the
same
route
as
on
his
first
expedition
,
over
the
*NL*
plain
of
Montiel
,
which
he
passed
with
less
inconvenience
than
before
,
*NL*
for
it
was
early
in
the
morning
,
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
,
darting
on
*NL*
them
horizontally
,
did
not
annoy
them
.
Sancho
Panza
now
said
to
his
*NL*
master
:
``
I
beseech
your
worship
,
good
sir
knight-errant
,
not
to
forget
*NL*
your
promise
concerning
that
same
island
;
for
I
shall
know
how
to
govern
*NL*
it
,
be
it
ever
so
large
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
answered
:
``
Thou
must
know
,
friend
Sancho
Panza
,
*NL*
that
it
was
a
custom
much
in
use
among
the
knights-errant
of
old
to
make
*NL*
their
squires
governors
of
the
islands
or
kingdoms
they
conquered
,
and
I
*NL*
am
determined
that
so
laudable
a
custom
,
shall
not
be
lost
through
my
*NL*
neglect
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
resolve
to
outdo
them
in
it
:
for
they
*NL*
sometimes
,
and
perhaps
most
times
,
waited
till
their
squires
were
grown
*NL*
old
;
and
when
they
were
worn
out
in
their
service
,
and
had
endured
many
*NL*
bad
days
and
worse
nights
,
they
conferred
on
them
some
title
,
such
as
*NL*
count
,
or
at
least
marquis
,
of
some
valley
or
province
of
more
or
less
*NL*
account
;
but
if
you
live
,
and
I
live
,
before
six
days
have
passed
I
may
*NL*
probably
win
such
a
kingdom
as
may
have
others
depending
on
it
,
just
fit
*NL*
for
thee
to
be
crowned
king
of
one
of
them
.
And
do
not
think
this
any
*NL*
extraordinary
matter
,
for
things
fall
out
to
knights
by
such
unforeseen
*NL*
and
unexpected
ways
,
that
I
may
easily
give
thee
more
than
I
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
,
''
answered
Sancho
Panza
,
``
if
I
were
a
king
by
some
of
those
*NL*
miracles
your
worship
mentions
,
Joan
Gutierrez
,
my
duck
,
would
come
to
*NL*
be
a
queen
,
and
my
children
infantas
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
doubts
it
?
''
answered
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
it
,
''
replied
Sancho
Panza
,
``
for
I
am
verily
persuaded
that
,
if
*NL*
God
were
to
rain
down
kingdoms
upon
the
earth
,
none
of
them
would
sit
*NL*
well
upon
the
head
of
Mary
Gutierrez
;
for
you
must
know
,
sir
,
she
is
not
*NL*
worth
two
farthings
for
a
queen
.
The
title
of
countess
would
sit
better
*NL*
upon
her
,
with
the
help
of
Heaven
and
good
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Recommend
her
to
God
,
Sancho
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
he
will
do
*NL*
what
is
best
for
her
,
but
do
thou
have
a
care
not
to
debase
thy
mind
so
*NL*
low
as
to
content
thyself
with
being
less
than
a
viceroy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
grant
us
good
success
,
and
that
we
may
speedily
get
this
island
*NL*
which
costs
me
so
dear
.
No
matter
then
how
soon
I
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
thee
,
Sancho
,
to
give
thyself
no
concern
upon
that
*NL*
account
;
for
,
if
an
island
can
not
be
had
,
there
is
the
kingdom
of
*NL*
Denmark
or
that
of
Sobradisa
,
which
will
fit
thee
like
a
ring
to
the
*NL*
finger
.
Besides
,
as
they
are
upon
_
terra
firma
_
,
thou
shouldst
prefer
*NL*
them
.
But
let
us
leave
this
to
its
own
time
,
and
see
if
thou
hast
*NL*
anything
for
us
to
eat
in
thy
wallet
.
We
will
then
go
in
quest
of
some
*NL*
castle
,
where
we
may
lodge
this
night
and
make
the
balsam
that
I
told
*NL*
thee
of
,
for
I
declare
that
my
ear
pains
me
exceedingly

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
here
an
onion

a
piece
of
cheese

I
know
not
how
many
*NL*
crusts
of
bread
,

said
Sancho
,
``

they
are
not
eatables
fit
for
so
*NL*
valiant
a
knight
as
your
worship

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
little
dost
thou
understand
of
this
matter
!
''
answered
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
``
I
tell
thee
,
Sancho
,
that
it
is
honorable
in
knights-errant
not
to
eat
*NL*
once
in
a
month
;
and
,
if
they
do
taste
food
,
it
must
be
what
first
*NL*
offers
:
and
this
thou
wouldst
have
known
hadst
thou
read
as
many
*NL*
histories
as
I
have
done
;
for
,
though
I
have
perused
many
,
I
never
yet
*NL*
found
in
them
any
account
of
knights-errant
taking
food
,
unless
it
were
*NL*
by
chance
and
at
certain
sumptuous
banquets
prepared
expressly
for
them
.
*NL*
The
rest
of
their
days
they
lived
,
as
it
were
,
upon
smelling
.
And
though
*NL*
it
is
to
be
presumed
they
could
not
subsist
without
eating
and
*NL*
satisfying
all
other
wants
,
--
as
,
in
fact

they
were
men

passed
most
part
of
their
lives
in
wandering
through
forests

deserts

without
a
cook

their
usual
diet
must
have
consisted
of
*NL*
rustic
viands
,
such
as
those
which
thou
hast
now
offered
me
.
Therefore
,
*NL*
friend
Sancho
,
let
not
that
trouble
thee
which
gives
me
pleasure
,
nor
*NL*
endeavor
to
make
a
new
world

to
throw
knight-errantry
off
its
*NL*
hinges

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me

said
Sancho

After
Don
Quixote
had
satisfied
his
hunger
,
he
took
up
a
handful
of
*NL*
acorns
,
and
,
looking
on
them
attentively
,
gave
utterance
to
expressions
*NL*
like
these
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
times
and
happy
ages
were
those
which
the
ancients
termed
the
*NL*
Golden
Age
!
Not
because
gold
,
so
prized
in
this
our
Iron
age
,
was
to
be
*NL*
obtained
,
in
that
fortunate
period
,
without
toil
;
but
because
they
who
*NL*
then
lived
were
ignorant
of
those
two
words
,
Mine
and
Thine
.
In
that
*NL*
blessed
age
all
things
were
in
common
;
to
provide
their
ordinary
*NL*
sustenance
no
other
labor
was
necessary
than
to
raise
their
hands
and
*NL*
take
it
from
the
sturdy
oaks
,
which
stood
liberally
inviting
them
to
*NL*
taste
their
sweet
and
relishing
fruit
.
The
limpid
fountains
and
running
*NL*
streams
offered
them
,
in
magnificent
abundance
,
their
delicious
and
*NL*
transparent
waters
.
In
the
clefts
of
rocks

and
in
hollow
trees

the
*NL*
industrious
and
provident
bees
formed
their
commonwealths
,
offering
to
*NL*
every
hand

without
interest

the
fertile
produce
of
their
most
*NL*
delicious
toil

The
stately
cork-trees
,
impelled
by
their
own
courtesy
*NL*
alone
,
divested
themselves
of
their
light
and
expanded
bark
,
with
which
*NL*
men
began
to
cover
their
houses
,
supported
by
rough
poles
,
only
as
a
*NL*
defence
against
the
inclemency
of
the
heavens
.
All
then
was
peace
,
all
*NL*
amity
,
all
concord

The
heavy
colter
of
the
crooked
plough
had
not
yet
*NL*
dared
to
force
open
and
search
into
the
tender
bowels
of
our
first
*NL*
mother
,
who
,
unconstrained
,
offered
from
every
part
of
her
fertile
and

spacious
bosom
whatever
might
feed

sustain
,
and

those

her

whom
she
was
then
possessed

on
the
*NL*
other
;
and
above
all
,
she
was
a
notable
housewife
,
and
a
*NL*
friend
to
the
poor
;
for
which
I
believe
her
soul
is
at
this
*NL*
very
moment
in
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
clergyman
must
be
over
and
above
good
,
who
makes
all
his
*NL*
parishioners
speak
well
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Parents
ought
not
to
settle
their
children
against
their
*NL*
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
does
not
fly
or
shun
the
company
and
conversation
*NL*
of
the
shepherds
,
but
treats
them
in
a
courteous
and
*NL*
friendly
manner
,
yet
,
when
any
one
of
them
ventures
to
*NL*
discover
his
intention
,
though
it
be
as
just
and
holy
as
*NL*
that
of
marriage
,
she
casts
him
from
her
as
out
of
a
*NL*
stone-bow
.
And
by
this
sort
of
behavior
she
does
more
*NL*
mischief
in
this
country
than
if
she
carried
the
plague
*NL*
about
with
her
;
for
her
affability
and
beauty
win
the
hearts
*NL*
of
those
who
converse
with
her
,
and
incline
them
to
serve
*NL*
and
love
her
;
but
her
disdain
and
frank
dealing
drive
them
*NL*
to
despair
;
and
so
they
know
not
what
to
say
to
her
,
and
can
*NL*
only
exclaim
against
her
,
calling
her
cruel
and
ungrateful
,
*NL*
with
such
other
titles
as
plainly
denote
her
character
;
and
,
*NL*
were
you
to
abide
here
,
sir
,
awhile
,
you
would
hear
these
*NL*
mountains
and
valleys
resound
with
the
complaints
of
those
*NL*
rejected
wretches
that
yet
follow
her
.
There
is
a
place
not
*NL*
far
hence
,
where
about
two
dozen
of
tall
beeches
grow
,
and
*NL*
not
one
of
them
is
without
the
name
of
Marcela
written
and
*NL*
engraved
on
its
smooth
bark
;
over
some
of
them
is
carved
a
*NL*
crown
,
as
if
the
lover
would
more
clearly
observe
that
*NL*
Marcela
deserves
and
wears
the
crown
of
all
human
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revels
,
banquets
,
and
repose
,
were
invented
for
effeminate
*NL*
courtiers
;
but
toil
,
disquietude
,
and
arms
alone
were
*NL*
designed
for
those
whom
the
world
calls
knights-errant
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
never
sure
was
any
knight
*NL*
So
served
by
damsel
,
or
by
dame
,
*NL*
As
Lancelot
,
that
man
of
might
,
*NL*
When
he
at
first
from
Britain
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
who
executes
his
captain
's
command
is
no
less
*NL*
valuable
than
the
captain
who
gave
the
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
of
the
same
opinion
,
''
replied
the
traveller
;
``
but
one
thing
,
among
*NL*
many
others
which
appear
to
me
to
be
censurable
in
knights-errant
,
is
*NL*
that
,
when
they
are
prepared
to
engage
in
some
great
and
perilous
*NL*
adventure
to
the
manifest
hazard
of
their
lives
,
at
the
moment
of
attack
*NL*
they
never
think
of
commending
themselves
to
God
,
as
every
Christian
is
*NL*
bound
to
do
at
such
a
crisis
,
but
rather
commend
themselves
to
their
*NL*
mistresses
,
and
that
with
as
much
fervor
and
devotion
as
if
they
were
*NL*
really
their
God
;
a
thing
which
to
me
savors
of
paganism
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signor
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
this
can
by
no
means
be
otherwise
;
and
*NL*
the
knight-errant
who
should
act
in
any
other
manner
would
digress
much
*NL*
from
his
duty
;
for
it
is
a
received
maxim
and
custom
in
chivalry
,
that
*NL*
the
knight-errant
,
who
,
on
the
point
of
engaging
in
some
great
feat
of
*NL*
arms
,
has
his
lady
before
him
,
must
turn
his
eyes
fondly
and
amorously
*NL*
towards
her
,
as
if
imploring
her
favor
and
protection
in
the
hazardous
*NL*
enterprise
that
awaits
him
;
and
,
even
if
nobody
hear
him
,
he
must
*NL*
pronounce
some
words
between
his
teeth
,
by
which
he
commends
himself
to
*NL*
her
with
his
whole
heart
;
and
of
this
we
have
innumerable
examples
in
*NL*
history
.
Nor
is
it
thence
to
be
inferred
that
they
neglect
commending
*NL*
themselves
to
God
;
for
there
is
time
and
opportunity
enough
to
do
it
in
*NL*
the
course
of
the
action

*NL*
*NL*
``
Notwithstanding
all
that
,
''
replied
the
traveller
,
``
better
had
it
been
*NL*
if
the
words
he
spent
in
commending
himself
to
his
lady
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
the
career
,
had
been
employed
as
the
duties
of
a
Christian
require
;
*NL*
particularly
as
I
imagine
that
all
knights-errant
have
not
ladies
to
*NL*
commend
themselves
to
,
because
they
are
not
all
in
love

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
can
not

''
answered
Don
Quixote
:
``
I
say
there
can
not
be
a
*NL*
knight-errant
without
a
mistress
;
for
it
is
as
essential
and
as
natural
*NL*
for
them
to
be
enamored
as
for
the
sky
to
have
stars
;
and
most
*NL*
certainly
,
no
history
exists
in
which
a
knight-errant
is
to
be
found
*NL*
without
an
amour
;
for
,
from
the
very
circumstance
of
his
being
without
,
*NL*
he
would
not
be
acknowledged
as
a
legitimate
knight
,
but
a
bastard
who
*NL*
had
entered
the
fortress
of
chivalry
,
not
by
the
gate
,
but
over
the
*NL*
pales
,
like
a
thief
and
robber

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
said
the
traveller
,
``
if
I
am
not
mistaken

I
remember
*NL*
having
read
that
Don

to
the
valorous
Amadis
de
Gaul
,
*NL*
never
had
a
particular
mistress

to
whom
he
might
commend
himself
;
*NL*
notwithstanding
which
,
he
was
no

esteemed

was
a
very
valiant
*NL*

famous
knight

*NL*
*NL*
To
which
our

*NL*
``
If
it
is
essential
that

be

said
the
*NL*
traveller
,
``
it
may
well
be
presumed
that
you

the

yourself

Here
Don

breathed
a
deep
sigh

said
:

not
positively

I
can
only
say
,
in

to
what
*NL*
you
so
very
courteously
inquire
of
me
,
that
her
name
is
Dulcinea

her
*NL*
country
Toboso

a
town
of

:
her
quality
at

that
of
a
*NL*
princess
,
since
she
is
my
queen
and
sovereign
lady
;
her
beauty
more
than
*NL*
human
,
since
in
her
all
the
impossible
and
chimerical
attributes
of
*NL*
beauty
which
the
poets
ascribe
to
their
mistresses
are
realized
;

She
is
of

modern
,
is
yet
such

give

let

THE

OF
CHRYSOSTOM
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

,
''
continued
the
youth
,
``
that
the
famous
shepherd

*NL*
scholar
,
Chrysostom
,
died
this
morning
;
and
it
is
rumored
that
it
was
*NL*
for
love
of
that
saucy
girl
Marcela
,
daughter
of
William
the
rich
;
she
*NL*
who
rambles
about

*NL*
``
For

,
I

answered
the
goatherd
;
``
and
the
best
of
it
is
,
he
has
*NL*
ordered
in
his
will
that
they
should
bury
him
in
the
fields
,
like
a
*NL*
Moor
,
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
,
by
the
cork-tree
fountain
,
which
,
*NL*
according
to
report
,
and
as
they
say
,
he
himself
declared
was
the
very
*NL*
place
where
he
first
saw
her
.
He
ordered
also
other
tilings
so
*NL*
extravagant
that
the
clergy
say
they
must
not
be
performed
;
nor
is
it
*NL*
fit
that
they
should

But
his

the

who
accompanied
him
,
dressed
also
like
a

declares

of

enjoined
shall
be

executed

upon

the

all
in

by

I

they

at

do
what

require

they
come

inter
him

I

not

do
not

which
Pedro
answered

had
studied
many

with
the

and
well
read

;
particularly
,
it
was
said
,
he
understood

the
science
of
the
stars

what
the
sun

are
doing
in

And

as
I
was
saying
,
his

gave
credit
to
his

words

became
very
rich
thereby
;
for
they
followed
his

everything

he
would
say
,
`

,
and
not

you
may
sow

there
will

following
there
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
science
they
call
astrology

Don

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
how
it
is
called
,
''
replied
Pedro
,
``
but
I
know
that
he
knew
*NL*
all
this

and
more
too

In
short
,
not
many
months
after
he
came
from
*NL*
Salamanca
,
on
a
certain
day
he
appeared
dressed
like
a
shepherd
,
with
*NL*
his
crook
and
sheepskin
jacket
,
having
thrown
aside
his
scholar
's
gown
;
*NL*
and
with
an
intimate
friend
of
his
,
called
Ambrosio
,
who
had
been
his
*NL*
fellow-student
,
and
who
now
put
on
likewise
the
apparel
of
a
shepherd
.
I
*NL*
forgot
to
tell
you
how
the
deceased
Chrysostom
was
a
great
man
at
making
*NL*
verses
;
insomuch
that
he
made
the
carols
for
Christmas-eve
and
the
*NL*
religious
plays
for
Corpus
Christi
,
which
the
boys
of
the
village
*NL*
represented
;
and
everybody
said
they
were
most
excellent
.
When
the
*NL*
people
of
the
village
saw
the
two
scholars
so
suddenly
habited
like
*NL*
shepherds
,
they
were
amazed
,
and
could
not
get
at
the
cause
that
induced
*NL*
them
to
make
that
strange
alteration
in
their
dress
.
About
this
time
the
*NL*
father
of
Chrysostom
died
,
and
he
inherited
a
large
estate
,
in
lands
and
*NL*
goods
,
flocks
,
herds
,
and
money
,
of
all
which
the
youth
remained
*NL*
absolute
master
;
and
,
indeed
,
he
deserved
it
all
,
for
he
was
a
very
good
*NL*
companion
,
a
charitable
man
,
and
a
friend
to
those
that
were
good
,
and
*NL*
had
a
face
like
any
blessing
.
Afterwards
it
came
to
be
known
that
he
*NL*
changed
his
habit
for
no
other
purpose
but
that
he
might
wander
about
*NL*
these
desert
places
after
that
shepherdess
Marcela
,
with
whom
,
as
our
*NL*
lad
told
you
,
he
was
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
all
that
I
have
related
is
certain
truth
,
I
can
more
readily
believe
*NL*
what
our
companion
told
us
concerning
the
cause
of
Chrysostom
's
death
;
*NL*
and
therefore
I
advise
you
,
sir
,
not
to
fail
being
to-morrow
at
his
*NL*
funeral
,
which
will
be
very
well
worth
seeing
;
for
Chrysostom
had
a
*NL*
great
many
friends
,
and
it
is
not
half
a
league
hence
to
the
place
of
*NL*
interment
appointed
by
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
certainly
be
there
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
I
thank
you
for
the
*NL*
pleasure
you
have
given
me
by
the
recital
of
so
entertaining
a
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
scarcely
had
dawned
through
the
balconies
of
the
east
,
when
five
*NL*
of
the
six
goatherds
got
up
and
went
to
awake
Don
Quixote
,
whom
they
*NL*
asked
whether
he
continued
in
his
resolution
of
going
to
see
the
famous
*NL*
interment
of
Chrysostom
,
for
,
if
so
,
they
would
bear
him
company
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
desired
nothing
more
,
arose
,
and
ordered
Sancho
to
saddle
*NL*
and
pannel
immediately
,
which
he
did
with
great
expedition
;
and
with
the
*NL*
same
dispatch
they
all
set
out
on
their
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
gone
a
quarter
of
a
league
,
when
upon
crossing
a
pathway
,
*NL*
they
saw
six
shepherds
advancing
towards
them
,
clad
in
jackets
of
black
*NL*
sheepskin
,
with
garlands
of
cypress
and
bitter
rosemary
on
their
heads
;
*NL*
each
of
them
having
in
his
hand
a
thick
holly
club
.
There
came
also
with
*NL*
them
two
gentlemen
on
horseback
,
well
equipped
for
travelling
,
who
were
*NL*
attended
by
three
lackeys
on
foot
.
When
the
two
parties
met
they
*NL*
courteously
saluted
each
other
,
and
finding
upon
inquiry
that
all
were
*NL*
proceeding
to
the
place
of
burial
,
they
continued
their
journey
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Proceeding
on
,
they
discerned
through
a
cleft
between
two
high
mountains
*NL*
about
twenty
shepherds
coming
down
,
all
clad
in
jerkins
of
black
wool
,
*NL*
and
crowned
with
garlands
,
some
of
which
were
of
yew
,
and
some
of
*NL*
cypress
.
Six
of
them
carried
a
bier
covered
with
various
flowers
and
*NL*
boughs
.
One
of
the
goatherds
said
:
``
Those
who
come
hither
are
bearing
*NL*
the
corpse
of
Chrysostom
,
and
at
the
foot
of
yonder
mountain
is
the
*NL*
place
where
he
desired
to
be
interred
.
''
Four
of
them
,
with
sharp
*NL*
pickaxes
,
were
making
the
grave
by
the
side
of
a
sharp
rock
.
Upon
the
*NL*
bier
lay
a
dead
body
,
strewed
with
flowers
,
in
the
dress
of
a
shepherd
,
*NL*
apparently
about
thirty
years
of
age
;
and
though
dead
,
it
was
evident
*NL*
that
his
countenance
had
been
beautiful
and
his
figure
elegant
.
Several
*NL*
books
and
a
great
number
of
papers
,
some
open
and
some
folded
,
lay
round
*NL*
him
on
the
bier
.
All
that
were
present
,
spectators
as
well
as
those
who
*NL*
were
opening
the
grave
,
kept
a
marvellous
silence
,
until
one
said
to
*NL*
another
:
``
Observe
carefully
,
Ambrosio
,
whether
this
be
the
place
which
*NL*
Chrysostom
mentioned
since
you
wish
to
be
so
exact
in
executing
his
*NL*
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
here
,
''
answered
Ambrosio
;
``
for
in
this
very
place
my
unhappy
*NL*
friend
often
told
me
of
his
woe
.
Here
it
was
,
he
told
me
,
that
he
first
*NL*
beheld
that
mortal
enemy
of
the
human
race
;
here
it
was
that
he
declared
*NL*
to
her
his
no
less
honorable
than
ardent
passion
;
here
it
was
that
*NL*
Marcela
finally
undeceived
and
treated
him
with
such
disdain
that
she
*NL*
put
an
end
to
the
tragedy
of
his
miserable
life
;
and
here
,
in
memory
of
*NL*
so
many
misfortunes
,
he
desired
to
be
deposited
in
the
bowels
of
eternal
*NL*
oblivion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
addressing
himself
to
Don
Quixote
and
the
travellers
,
he
thus
*NL*
continued
:
``
This
body
,
sirs
,
which
you
are
regarding
with
compassionate
*NL*
eyes
,
was
the
receptacle
of
a
soul
upon
which
Heaven
had
bestowed
an
*NL*
infinite
portion
of
its
treasures
;
this
is
the
body
of
Chrysostom
,
who
*NL*
was
a
man
of
rare
genius
,
matchless
courtesy
,
and
unbounded
kindness
;
he
*NL*
was
a
phoenix
in
friendship
,
magnificent
without
ostentation
,
grave
*NL*
without
arrogance
,
cheerful
without
meanness
;
in
short
,
the
first
in
all
*NL*
that
was
good
,
and
second
to
none
in
all
that
was
unfortunate
.
He
loved
,
*NL*
and
was
abhorred
;
he
adored
,
and
was
scorned
;
he
courted
a
savage
;
he
*NL*
solicited
a
statue
;
he
pursued
the
wind
;
he
called
aloud
to
the
desert
;
*NL*
he
was
the
slave
of
ingratitude
,
whose
recompense
was
to
leave
him
,
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
his
career
of
life
,
a
prey
to
death
,
inflicted
by
a
*NL*
certain
shepherdess
,
whom
he
endeavored
to
render
immortal
in
the
*NL*
memories
of
men
;
as
these
papers
you
are
looking
at
would
sufficiently
*NL*
demonstrate
,
had
he
not
ordered
me
to
commit
them
to
the
flames
at
the
*NL*
same
time
that
his
body
was
deposited
in
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
then
be
more
rigorous
and
cruel
to
them
,
''
said
Vivaldo
,
``
than
*NL*
their
master
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
neither
just
nor
wise
to
fulfil
the
will
of
him
who
commands
what
*NL*
is
utterly
unreasonable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Augustus
Caesar
deemed
it
wrong
to
consent
to
the
execution
of
what
the
*NL*
divine
Mantuan
commanded
in
his
will
;
therefore
,
Signor
Ambrosio
,
*NL*
although
you
commit
your
friend
's
body
to
the
earth
,
do
not
commit
his
*NL*
writings
also
to
oblivion
;
and
if
he
has
ordained
like
a
man
aggrieved
,
*NL*
do
not
you
fulfil
like
one
without
discretion
,
but
rather
preserve
those
*NL*
papers
,
in
order
that
the
cruelty
of
Marcela
may
be
still
remembered
,
*NL*
and
serve
for
an
example
to
those
who
shall
live
in
times
to
come
,
that
*NL*
they
may
avoid
falling
down
the
like
precipices
;
for
I
am
acquainted
,
as
*NL*
well
as
my
companions
here
,
with
the
story
of
this
your
enamored
and
*NL*
despairing
friend
;
we
know
also
your
friendship
,
and
the
occasion
of
*NL*
his
death
,
and
what
he
ordered
on
his
deathbed
;
from
which
lamentable
*NL*
history
we
may
conclude
how
great
has
been
the
cruelty
of
Marcela
,
the
*NL*
love
of
Chrysostom
,
and
the
sincerity
of
your
friendship
;
and
also
learn
*NL*
the
end
of
those
who
run
headlong
in
the
path
that
delirious
passion
*NL*
presents
to
their
view
.
Last
night
we
heard
of
Chrysostom
's
death
,
and
*NL*
that
he
was
to
be
interred
in
this
place
;
led
,
therefore
,
by
curiosity
*NL*
and
compassion
,
we
turned
out
of
our
way
,
and
determined
to
behold
with
*NL*
our
eyes
what
had
interested
us
so
much
in
the
recital
;
and
,
in
return
*NL*
for
our
pity
,
and
our
desire
to
give
aid
,
had
it
been
possible
,
we
*NL*
beseech
you
,
oh
wise
Ambrosio
--
at
least
I
request
it
on
my
own
*NL*
behalf
--
that
you
will
not
burn
the
papers
,
but
allow
me
to
take
some
of
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
without
waiting
for
the
shepherd
's
reply
,
he
stretched
out
his
*NL*
hand
and
took
some
of
those
that
were
nearest
to
him
:
upon
which
*NL*
Ambrosio
said
:
``
Out
of
civility
,
signor
,
I
will
consent
to
your
keeping
*NL*
those
you
have
taken
;
but
if
you
expect
that
I
shall
forbear
burning
*NL*
those
that
remain
,
you
are
deceived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vivaldo
,
desirous
of
seeing
what
the
papers
contained
,
immediately
*NL*
opened
one
of
them
,
and
found
that
it
was
entitled
,
``
The
Song
of
*NL*
Despair
.
''
Ambrosio
,
hearing
it
,
said
:
``
This
is
the
last
thing
which
the
*NL*
unhappy
man
wrote
;
and
that
all
present
may
conceive
,
signor
,
to
what
a
*NL*
state
of
misery
he
was
reduced
,
read
it
aloud
;
for
you
will
have
time
*NL*
enough

they
are
digging
the
grave

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
do
with
all
my
heart

said
Vivaldo
;
and
,
as
all
the
*NL*
bystanders
had
the
same
desire
,
they
assembled
around
him
,
and
he
read
*NL*
in
an
audible
voice
as
follows
:
--

you
force
me
to
proclaim

From

the
triumph
of
your
scorn

Let
hell
itself
inspire
my
tortured
breast

mournful
numbers

untune
my
voice

pieces

Mix
with

accents

tongue

At

to
tell
my
griefs

exploits

*NL*
Hear

then
,
and
listen
with
attentive
ear

*NL*
Not
to
harmonious
sounds

echoing
groans

*NL*
Fetched
from
the
bottom
of

laboring
breast

To

in

thee

The

With
notes

the
mournful

join

alone
befits

sent

And

Complain
no

but
since
thy
wretched
fate
*NL*
Improves
her
happier
lot
who
gave
thee
birth
,
*NL*
Be
all
thy

buried

*NL*
*NL*
None
of
the
shepherds
departed
until
,
the
grave
being
made
and
the
*NL*
papers
burnt
,
the
body
of
Chrysostom
was
interred
,
not
without
many
*NL*
tears
from
the
spectators
.
They
closed
the
sepulchre
with
a
large
*NL*
fragment
of
a
rock
until
a
tombstone
was
finished
,
which
Ambrosio
said
*NL*
it
was
his
intention
to
provide
,
and
to
inscribe
upon
it
the
following
*NL*
epitaph
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
CHRYSOSTOM
'S
EPITAPH
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
body
of
a
wretched
swain
,
*NL*
Killed
by
a
cruel
maid
's
disdain
,
*NL*
In
this
cold
bed
neglected
lies
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lived
,
fond
,
hapless
youth
!
to
prove
*NL*
Th
'
inhuman
tyranny
of
love
,
*NL*
Exerted
in
Marcela
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
strewed
abundance
of
flowers
and
boughs
*NL*
on
the
grave
,
and
after
expressions
of
condolence
to
his
*NL*
friend
Ambrosio
,
they
took
their
leave
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
beauty
does
not
inspire
love
;
some
please
the
sight
*NL*
without
captivating
the
affections
.
If
all
beauties
were
to
*NL*
enamour
and
captivate
,
the
hearts
of
mankind
would
be
in
a
*NL*
continual
state
of
perplexity
and
confusion
--
for
beautiful
*NL*
objects
being
infinite
,
the
sentiments
they
inspire
should
*NL*
also
be
infinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
True
love
can
not
be
divided
,
and
must
be
voluntary
and
*NL*
unconstrained
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
viper
deserves
no
blame
for
its
sting
,
although
it
be
*NL*
mortal
--
because
it
is
the
gift
of
Nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beauty
in
a
modest
woman
is
like
fire
or
a
sharp
sword
at
a
*NL*
distance
;
neither
doth
the
one
burn
nor
the
other
wound
*NL*
those
that
come
not
too
near
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Honor
and
virtue
are
ornaments
of
the
soul
,
without
which
*NL*
the
body
,
though
it
be
really
beautiful
,
ought
not
to
be
*NL*
thought
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
him
who
is
deceived
complain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
him
to
whom
faith
is
broken
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
who
loves
none
can
make
none
jealous
,
and
sincerity
*NL*
ought
not
to
pass
for
disdain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
time
is
necessary
to
know
people
thoroughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
sure
of
nothing
in
this
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
remembrance
which
time
does
not
obliterate
,
nor
*NL*
pain
which
death
does
not
terminate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortune
always
leaves
some
door
open
in
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
we
look
for
one
thing
and
find
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Self-praise
depreciates

*NL*

more

The

*NL*
*NL*
One
effect
of

is
to
disturb

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
DEAD
BODY
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
,
advancing
towards
them
,
on
the
same
road
,
a
great
number
of
*NL*
lights
,
resembling
so
many
moving
stars
.
Sancho
stood
aghast
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
them
,
nor
was
Don
Quixote
unmoved
.
The
one
checked
his
ass
and
*NL*
the
other
his
horse
,
and
both
stood
looking
before
them
with
eager
*NL*
attention
.
They
perceived
that
the
lights
were
advancing
towards
them
,
*NL*
and
that
as
they
approached
nearer
they
appeared
larger
.
Sancho
trembled
*NL*
like
quicksilver
at
the
sight
,
and
Don
Quixote
's
hair
bristled
upon
his
*NL*
head
;
but
,
somewhat
recovering
himself
,
he
exclaimed
:
``
Sancho
,
this
must
*NL*
be
a
most
perilous
adventure
,
wherein
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
*NL*
exert
my
whole
might
and
valor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woe
is
me
!
''
answered
Sancho
;
``
should
this
prove
to
be
an
adventure
of
*NL*
goblins
,
as
to
me
it
seems
to
be
,
where
shall
I
find
ribs
to
endure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatsoever
phantoms
they
may
be
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
will
not
suffer
*NL*
them
to
touch
a
thread
of
thy
garment
:
for
if
they
sported
with
thee
*NL*
before
,
it
was
because
I
could
not
get
over
the
wall
;
but
we
are
now
*NL*
upon
even
ground
,
where
I
can
brandish
my
sword
at
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
if
they
should
enchant
and
benumb
you
,
as
they
did
then
,
''
quoth
*NL*
Sancho
,
``
what
matters
it
whether
we
are
in
the
open
field
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Notwithstanding
that
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
beseech
thee
,
Sancho
,
to
*NL*
be
of
good
courage
;
for
experience
shall
give
thee
sufficient
proof
of
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
if
it
please
God
,
''
answered
Sancho
;
and
,
retiring
a
little
on
*NL*
one
side
of
the
road
,
and
again
endeavoring
to
discover
what
those
*NL*
walking
lights
might
be
,
they
soon
after
perceived
a
great
many
persons
*NL*
clothed
in
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dreadful
spectacle
completely
annihilated
the
courage
of
Sancho
,
*NL*
whose
teeth
began
to
chatter
,
as
if
seized
with
a
quartan
ague
;
and
his
*NL*
trembling
and
chattering
increased
as
more
of
it
appeared
in
view
;
for
*NL*
now
they
discovered
about
twenty
persons
in
white
robes
,
all
on
*NL*
horseback
,
with
lighted
torches
in
their
hands
;
behind
them
came
a
*NL*
litter
covered
with
black
,
which
was
followed
by
six
persons
in
deep
*NL*
mourning
;
the
mules
on
which
they
were
mounted
being
covered
likewise
*NL*
with
black
down
to
their
heels
;
for
that
they
were
mules
,
and
not
*NL*
horses
,
was
evident
by
the
slowness
of
their
pace
.
Those
robed
in
white
*NL*
were
muttering
to
themselves
in
a
low
and
plaintive
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
strange
vision
,
at
such
an
hour
,
and
in
a
place
so
uninhabited
*NL*
might
well
strike
terror
into
Sancho
's
heart
,
and
even
into
that
of
his
*NL*
master
;
and
so
it
would
have
done
had
he
been
any
other
than
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
As
for
Sancho
,
his
whole
stock
of
courage
was
now
exhausted
.
*NL*
But
it
was
otherwise
with
his
master
,
whose
lively
imagination
instantly
*NL*
suggested
to
him
that
this
must
be
truly
a
chivalrous
adventure
.
He
*NL*
conceived
that
the
litter
was
a
bier
,
whereon
was
carried
some
knight
*NL*
sorely
wounded
,
or
slain
,
whose
revenge
was
reserved
for
him
alone
;
he
,
*NL*
therefore
,
without
delay
couched
his
spear
,
seated
himself
firm
in
his
*NL*
saddle
,
and
with
grace
and
spirit
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
road
*NL*
by
which
the
procession
must
pass
;
and
,
when
they
were
near
,
he
raised
*NL*
his
voice
and
said
:
``
Ho
,
knights
,
whoever
ye
are
,
halt
,
and
give
me
an
*NL*
account
to
whom
ye
belong
;
whence
ye
come
,
whither
ye
are
going
,
and
*NL*
what
it
is
ye
carry
upon
that
bier
;
for
in
all
appearance
either
ye
have
*NL*
done
some
injury
to
others
,
or
others
to
you
:
and
it
is
expedient
and
*NL*
necessary
that
I
be
informed
of
it
,
either
to
chastise
ye
for
the
evil
*NL*
ye
have
done
,
or
to
revenge
ye
of
wrongs
sustained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
in
haste
,
''
answered
one
in
the
procession
;
``
the
inn
is
a
great
*NL*
way
off
,
and
we
can
not
stay
to
give
so
long
an
account
as
you
require
.
''
*NL*
Then
,
spurring
his
mule
,
he
passed
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
highly
resenting
this
answer
,
laid
hold
of
his
bridle
and
*NL*
said
:
``
Stand
,
and
with
more
civility
give
me
the
account
I
demand
;
*NL*
otherwise
I
challenge
ye
all
to
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mule
was
timid
,
and
started
so
much
upon
his
touching
the
bridle
,
*NL*
that
,
rising
on
her
hind
legs
,
she
threw
her
rider
over
the
crupper
to
*NL*
the
ground
.
A
lacquey
that
came
on
foot
,
seeing
the
man
in
white
fall
,
*NL*
began
to
revile
Don
Quixote
,
whose
choler
being
now
raised
,
he
couched
*NL*
his
spear
,
and
immediately
attacking
one
of
the
mourners
,
laid
him
on
*NL*
the
ground
grievously
wounded
;
then
turning
about
to
the
rest
,
it
was
*NL*
worth
seeing
with
what
agility
he
attacked
and
defeated
them
;
and
it
*NL*
seemed
as
if
wings
at
that
instant
had
sprung
on
Rozinante
--
so
lightly
*NL*
and
swiftly
he
moved
!
All
the
white-robed
people
,
being
timorous
and
*NL*
unarmed
,
soon
quitted
the
skirmish
and
ran
over
the
plain
with
their
*NL*
lighted
torches
,
looking
like
so
many
masqueraders
on
a
carnival
or
*NL*
festival
night
.
The
mourners
were
so
wrapped
up
and
muffled
in
their
*NL*
long
robes
that
they
could
make
no
exertion
;
so
that
Don
Quixote
,
with
*NL*
entire
safety
,
assailed
them
all
,
and
,
sorely
against
their
will
,
*NL*
obliged
them
to
quit
the
field
;
for
they
thought
him
no
man
,
but
the
*NL*
devil
from
hell
broke
loose
upon
them
to
seize
the
dead
body
they
were
*NL*
conveying
in
the
litter
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
Sancho
beheld
with
admiration
at
his
master
's
intrepidity
,
and
*NL*
said
to
himself
:
``
This
master
of
mine
is
certainly
as
valiant
and
*NL*
magnanimous
as
he
pretends
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
burning
torch
lay
upon
the
ground
near
the
first
whom
the
mule
had
*NL*
overthrown
,
by
the
light
of
which
Don
Quixote
espied
him
,
and
going
up
*NL*
to
him
,
placed
the
point
of
his
spear
to
his
throat
,
commanding
him
to
*NL*
surrender
,
on
pain
of
death
.
To
which
the
fallen
man
answered
:
``
I
am
*NL*
surrendered
enough
already
,
since
I
can
not
stir
,
for
one
of
my
legs
is
*NL*
broken
.
I
beseech
you
,
sir
,
if
you
are
a
Christian
gentleman
,
do
not
*NL*
kill
me
:
you
would
commit
a
great
sacrilege
,
for
I
am
a
licentiate
and
*NL*
have
taken
the
lesser
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
the
devil
,
then
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
brought
you
hither
,
being
an
*NL*
ecclesiastic
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
sir
?
''
replied
the
fallen
man
;
``
my
evil
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
worse
fate
now
threatens
you
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
unless
you
reply
*NL*
satisfactorily
to
all
my
first
questions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
shall
soon
be
satisfied
,
''
answered
the
licentiate
;
``
and
*NL*
therefore
you
must
know
,
sir
,
that
though
I
told
you
before
I
was
a
*NL*
licentiate
,
I
am
in
fact
only
a
bachelor
of
arts
,
and
my
name
is
Alonzo
*NL*
Lopez
.
I
am
a
native
of
Alcovendas
,
and
came
from
the
city
of
Baeza
with
*NL*
eleven
more
ecclesiastics
,
the
same
who
fled
with
the
torches
.
We
were
*NL*
attending
the
corpse
in
that
litter
to
the
city
of
Segovia
.
It
is
that
*NL*
of
a
gentleman
who
died
in
Baeza
,
where
he
was
deposited
till
now
,
that
,
*NL*
as
I
said
before
,
we
are
carrying
his
bones
to
their
place
of
burial
in
*NL*
Segovia
,
where
he
was
born

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
killed
him
?
''
demanded
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
,
''
replied
the
bachelor
,
``
by
means
of
a
pestilential
fever

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
our
Lord
hath
saved
me
the
labor
of
revenging

his
death

But

since

fell
by

there
is
nothing
expected
from
us

patience

a
silent
shrug

for
just
the

must
I
have
done

it
*NL*
been
His
pleasure
to
pronounce
the
fatal
sentence
upon

THE
GRAND
ADVENTURE
AND
RICH
PRIZE
OF
MAMBRINO
'S
HELMET
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
it
began
to
rain
a
little
,
and
Sancho
proposed
entering
*NL*
the
fulling-mill
;
but
Don
Quixote
had
conceived
such
an
abhorrence
of
*NL*
them
for
the
late
jest
,
that
he
would
by
no
means
go
in
:
turning
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
the
right
hand
,
they
struck
into
another
road
,
like
that
*NL*
they
had
travelled
through
the
day
before
.
Soon
after
,
Don
Quixote
*NL*
discovered
a
man
on
horseback
,
who
had
on
his
head
something
which
*NL*
glittered
as
if
it
had
been
of
gold
;
and
scarcely
had
he
seen
it
when
,
*NL*
turning
to
Sancho
,
he
said
,
``
I
am
of
opinion
,
Sancho
,
there
is
no
*NL*
proverb
but
what
is
true
,
because
they
are
all
sentences
drawn
from
*NL*
experience
itself
,
the
mother
of
all
the
sciences
;
especially
that
which
*NL*
says
,
`
Where
one
door
is
shut
another
is
opened
.
'
I
say
this
because
,
if
*NL*
fortune
last
night
shut
the
door
against
what
we
sought
,
deceiving
us
*NL*
with
the
fulling-mills
,
it
now
opens
wide
another
,
for
a
better
and
*NL*
more
certain
adventure
;
in
which
,
if
I
am
deceived
,
the
fault
will
be
*NL*
mine
,
without
imputing
it
to
my
ignorance
of
fulling-mills
,
or
to
the
*NL*
darkness
of
night
.
This
I
say
because
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
there
comes
one
*NL*
towards
us
who
carries
on
his
head
Mambrino
's
helmet
,
concerning
which
*NL*
thou
mayest
remember
I
swore
the
oath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
sir
,
what
you
say
,
and
more
what
you
do
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
*NL*
I
would
not
wish
for
other
fulling-mills
,
to
finish
the
milling
and
*NL*
mashing
our
senses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
take
thee
!
''
replied
Don
Quixote
:
``
what
has
a
helmet
to
do
*NL*
with
fulling-mills
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
,
''
answered
Sancho
;
``
but
in
faith
,
if
I
might
talk
as
much
as
*NL*
I
used
to
do
,
perhaps
I
could
give
such
reasons
that
your
worship
would
*NL*
see
you
are
mistaken
in
what
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
be
mistaken
in
what
I
say
,
scrupulous
traitor
?
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
``
Tell
me
,
seest
thou
not
yon
knight
coming
towards
us
on
a
*NL*
dapple-gray
steed
,
with
a
helmet
of
gold
on
his
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
see
and
perceive
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
is
only
a
man
on
a
gray
ass
*NL*
like
mine
,
with
something
on
his
head
that
glitters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
is
Mambrino
's
helmet
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
retire
,
and
leave
*NL*
me
alone
to
deal
with
him
,
and
thou
shalt
see
how
,
in
order
to
save
*NL*
time
,
I
shall
conclude
this
adventure
without
speaking
a
word
,
and
the
*NL*
helmet
I
have
so
much
desired
remain
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
take
care
to
get
out
of
the
way
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
but
Heaven
*NL*
grant
,
I
say
again
,
it
may
not
prove
another
fulling-mill
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
thee
,
Sancho
,
not
to
mention
those
fulling-mills
,
*NL*
nor
even
think
of
them
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
:
``
if
thou
dost
--
I
say
no
more
,
*NL*
but
I
vow
to
mill
thy
soul
for
thee
!
''
Sancho
held
his
peace
,
fearing
*NL*
lest
his
master
should
perform
his
vow
,
which
had
struck
him
all
of
a
*NL*
heap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
truth
of
the
matter
,
concerning
the
helmet
,
the
steed
,
and
the
*NL*
knight
which
Don
Quixote
saw
,
was
this
.
There
were
two
villages
in
that
*NL*
neighborhood
,
one
of
them
so
small
that
it
had
neither
shop
nor
barber
,
*NL*
but
the
other
adjoining
to
it
had
both
;
therefore
the
barber
of
the
*NL*
larger
served
also
the
less
,
wherein
one
customer
now
wanted
to
be
let
*NL*
blood
and
another
to
be
shaved
;
to
perform
which
,
the
barber
was
now
on
*NL*
his
way
,
carrying
with
him
his
brass
basin
;
and
it
so
happened
that
*NL*
while
upon
the
road
it
began
to
rain
,
and
to
save
his
hat
,
which
was
a
*NL*
new
one
,
he
clapped
the
basin
on
his
head
,
which
being
lately
scoured
*NL*
was
seen
glittering
at
the
distance
of
half
a
league
;
and
he
rode
on
a
*NL*
gray
ass
,
as
Sancho
had
affirmed
.
Thus
Don
Quixote
took
the
barber
for
a
*NL*
knight
,
his
ass
for
a
dapple-gray
steed
,
and
his
basin
for
a
golden
*NL*
helmet
;
for
whatever
he
saw
was
quickly
adapted
to
his
knightly
*NL*
extravagances
:
and
when
the
poor
knight
drew
near
,
without
staying
to
*NL*
reason
the
case
with
him
,
he
advanced
at
Rozinante
's
best
speed
,
and
*NL*
couched
his
lance
,
intending
to
run
him
through
and
through
;
but
,
when
*NL*
close
upon
him
,
without
checking
the
fury
of
his
career
,
he
cried
out
,
*NL*
``
Defend
thyself
,
caitiff
!
or
instantly
surrender
what
is
justly
my
due
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
barber
,
so
unexpectedly
seeing
this
phantom
advancing
upon
him
,
had
*NL*
no
other
way
to
avoid
the
thrust
of
the
lance
than
to
slip
down
from
the
*NL*
ass
;
and
no
sooner
had
he
touched
the
ground
than
,
leaping
up
nimbler
*NL*
than
a
roebuck
,
he
scampered
over
the
plain
with
such
speed
that
the
*NL*
wind
could
not
overtake
him
.
The
basin
he
left
on
the
ground
;
with
which
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
satisfied
,
observing
that
the
pagan
had
acted
*NL*
discreetly
,
and
in
imitation
of
the
beaver
,
which
,
when
closely
pursued
*NL*
by
the
hunters
,
tears
off
with
his
teeth
that
which
it
knows
by
instinct
*NL*
to
be
the
object
of
pursuit
.
He
ordered
Sancho
to
take
up
the
helmet
;
*NL*
who
,
holding
it
in
his
hand
,
said
,
``
Before
Heaven
,
the
basin
is
a
*NL*
special
one
,
and
is
well
worth
a
piece
of
eight
,
if
it
is
worth
a
*NL*
farthing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
gave
it
to
his
master
,
who
immediately
placed
it
upon
his
head
,
*NL*
turning
it
round
in
search
of
the
visor
;
but
not
finding
it
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Doubtless
the
pagan
for
whom
this
famous
helmet
was
originally
forged
*NL*
must
have
had
a
prodigious
head
--
the
worst
of
it
is
that
one
half
is
*NL*
wanting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sancho
heard
the
basin
called
a
helmet
,
he
could
not
forbear
*NL*
laughing
;
which
,
however
,
he
instantly
checked
on
recollecting
his
*NL*
master
's
late
choler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dost
thou
laugh
at
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
laughing
,
''
answered
he
,
``
to
think
what
a
huge
head
the
pagan
had
*NL*
who
owned
that
helmet
,
which
is
for
all
the
world
just
like
a
barber
's
*NL*
basin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knowest
thou
,
Sancho
,
what
I
conceive
to
be
the
case
?
This
famous
*NL*
piece
,
this
enchanted
helmet
,
by
some
strange
accident
must
have
fallen
*NL*
into
the
possession
of
one
who
,
ignorant
of
its
true
value
as
a
helmet
*NL*
and
seeing
it
to
be
of
the
purest
gold
,
hath
inconsiderately
melted
down
*NL*
the
one-half
for
lucre
's
sake
,
and
of
the
other
half
made
this
,
which
,
*NL*
as
thou
sayest
,
doth
indeed
look
like
a
barber
's
basin
;
but
to
me
,
who
*NL*
know
what
it
really
is
,
its
transformation
is
of
no
importance
,
for
I
*NL*
will
have
it
so
repaired
in
the
first
town
where
there
is
a
smith
,
that
*NL*
it
shall
not
be
surpassed
nor
even
equalled
by
that
which
the
god
of
*NL*
smiths
himself
made
and
forged
for
the
god
of
battles
.
In
the
mean
time
*NL*
I
will
wear
it
as
I
best
can
,
for
something
is
better
than
nothing
;
and
*NL*
it
will
be
sufficient
to
defend
me
from
stones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Be
brief
in
thy
discourse
,
for
what
is
prolix
can
not
be
*NL*
pleasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
stand
begging
for
that
which
you
have
the
power
to
*NL*
take

There
are
two
kinds
of
lineages
in
the
world

Some
there
are
*NL*
who
derive
their
pedigree
from
princes
and
monarchs
,
whom
*NL*
time
has
gradually
reduced
until
they
have
ended
in
a
point
,
*NL*
like
a
pyramid
;
others
have
had
a
low
origin
,
and
have
risen
*NL*
by
degrees
,
until
they
have
become
great
lords
.
So
that
the
*NL*
difference
is
,
that
some
have
been
what
they
now
are
not
,
*NL*
and
others
are
now
what
they
were
not
before
.

A
leap
from
a
hedge
is
better
than
the
prayer
of

bishop

a
bush
is
better
than
the
prayer
of
*NL*
good
men

To
be
grateful
for
benefits
received
is
the
duty
of
honest
*NL*
men

one
of
the
sins
that
most
offendeth
God
is
ingratitude

*NL*
*NL*

conferred
on

the
part

*NL*
While
they
were
thus
discoursing
,
they
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
high
*NL*
mountain
,
which
stood
separated
from
several
others
that
surrounded
it
,
*NL*
as
if
it
had
been
hewn
out
from
them
.
Near
its
base
ran
a
gentle
stream
,
*NL*
that
watered
a
verdant
and
luxuriant
vale
,
adorned
with
many
*NL*
wide-spreading
trees
,
plants
,
and
wild
flowers
of
various
hues

This
was
*NL*
the
spot
in
which
the
knight
of
the
sorrowful
figure
chose
to
perform
*NL*
his
penance
;
and
,
while
contemplating
the
scene
,
he
thus
broke
forth
in
*NL*
a
loud
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This

increase

long

to
bewail
himself

to
what
a

thy

reduced
me

me

gently
your

carefully
imprint
on

thy

here
perform

thou

recount

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no

quoth
Sancho
,
``

I
am
*NL*
not

*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
took
out
the
pocket-book
,
and
,
stepping
aside
,
began
with
*NL*
much
composure
to
write
the
letter
;
and
having
finished
,
he
called
*NL*
Sancho
and
said
he
would
read
it
to
him
that
he
might
have
it
by
heart
,
*NL*
lest
he
might
perchance
lose
it
by
the
way
,
for
everything
was
to
be
*NL*
feared
from
his
evil
destiny
.
To
which
Sancho
answered
:
``
Write
it
,
sir
,
*NL*
two
or
three
times
in
the
book
,
and
give
it
me
,

I
will
take
good
*NL*
care
of
it
;
but
to
suppose
that
I
can
carry
it
in
my
memory
is
a
folly

mine
is
so
bad
that
I
often
forget
my

Your
worship

may
read
it

I
shall
be

He

pierced
by
the
arrows
of
love

O

greets

thee

My

O

to
what

*NL*
*NL*
Ye
lofty
trees
,
with
spreading

,
*NL*
The
pride
and
shelter
of
the
plain
;
*NL*
Ye
humble

Which
here
in
springing

If
my

Hear
the
sad
story
of

While
with
me
here
you
pass
your
hours
,
*NL*
Should
you
grow
faded
with

I
'll
bribe
you

You
shall
be

*NL*
Distant
,
though
present
in

*NL*
I
mourn
my

Dulcinea
*NL*
Del

*NL*
*NL*
Love
's
truest
slave
,
despairing
,
chose
*NL*
This
lonely
wild
,
this
desert
plain
,
*NL*
This
silent
witness
of
the
woes
*NL*
Which
he
,
though
guiltless
,
must
sustain
.
*NL*
Unknowing
why
these
pains
he
bears
,
*NL*
He
groans
,
he
raves
,
and
he
despairs
.
*NL*
With
lingering
fires
Love
racks
my
soul
:
*NL*
In
vain
I
grieve
,
in
vain
lament
;
*NL*
Like
tortured
fiends
I
weep
,
I
howl
,
*NL*
And
burn
,
yet
never
can
repent
.
*NL*
Distant
,
though
present
in
idea
,
*NL*
I
mourn
my
absent
Dulcinea
*NL*
Del
Toboso

*NL*
*NL*
While
I
through
Honor
's
thorny
ways
,
*NL*
In
search
of
distant
glory
rove
,
*NL*
Malignant
fate
my
toil
repays
*NL*
With
endless
woes
and
hopeless
love
.
*NL*
Thus
I
on
barren
rocks
despair
,
*NL*
And
curse
my
stars
,
yet
bless
my
fair
.
*NL*
Love
,
armed
with
snakes
,
has
left
his
dart
,
*NL*
And
now
does
like
a
fury
rave
;
*NL*
And
scourge
and
sting
on
every
part
,
*NL*
And
into
madness
lash
his
slave

are
adverse

what
is
human
power

*NL*
*NL*
Who
is
there
in
the
world
that
can
boast
of
having
fathomed
*NL*
and
thoroughly
penetrated
the
intricate
and
ever-changing
*NL*
nature
of
a
woman
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
causes
all
my
grief
and
pain
?
*NL*
Cruel
disdain
.
*NL*
What
aggravates
my
misery
?
*NL*
Accursed
jealousy
.
*NL*
How
has
my
soul
its
patience
lost
?
*NL*
By
tedious
absence
crossed
.
*NL*
Alas
!
no
balsam
can
be
found
*NL*
To
heal
the
grief
of
such
a
wound
.
*NL*
When
absence
,
jealousy
,
and
scorn
*NL*
Have
left
me
hopeless
and
forlorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
in
my
breast
this
grief
could
move
?
*NL*
Neglected
love
.
*NL*
What
doth
my
fond
desires
withstand
?
*NL*
Fate
's
cruel
hand
.
*NL*
And
what
confirms
my
misery
?
*NL*
Heaven
's
fixed
decree
.
*NL*
Ah
me
!
my
boding
fears
portend
,
*NL*
This
strange
disease
my
life
will
end
:
*NL*
For
die
I
must
,
when
three
such
foes
,
*NL*
Heaven
,
fate
,
and
love
,
my
bliss
oppose
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
peace
of
mind
,
what
can
restore
?
*NL*
Death
's
welcome
hour
.
*NL*
What
gains
love
's
joys
most
readily
?
*NL*
Fickle
inconstancy
.
*NL*
Its
pains
what
medicine
can
assuage
?
*NL*
Wild
frenzy
's
rage
.
*NL*
'T
is
therefore
little
wisdom
,
sure
,
*NL*
For
such
a
grief
to
seek
a
cure
,
*NL*
That
knows
no
better
remedy
*NL*
Than
frenzy
,
death
,
inconstancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
,
the
season
,
the
solitude
,
the
voice
,
and
the
skill
of
the
*NL*
singer
,
all
conspired
to
impress
the
auditors
with
wonder
and
delight
,
*NL*
and
they
remained
for
some
time
motionless
,
in
expectation
of
hearing
*NL*
more
;
but
,
finding
the
silence
continue
,
they
resolved
to
see
who
it
was
*NL*
who
had
sung
so
agreeably
,
and
were
again
detained
by
the
same
voice
*NL*
regaling
their
ears
with
this
sonnet
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Friendship
,
thou
hast
with
nimble
flight
*NL*
Exulting
gained
the
empyreal
height
,
*NL*
In
heaven
to
dwell
,
while
here
below
*NL*
Thy
semblance
reigns
in
mimic
show
;
*NL*
From
thence
to
earth
,
at
thy
behest
,
*NL*
Descends
fair
peace
,
celestial
guest
!
*NL*
Beneath
whose
veil
of
shining
hue
*NL*
Deceit
oft
lurks
,
concealed
from
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leave
,
friendship
!
leave
thy
heavenly
seat
,
*NL*
Or
strip
thy
livery
off
the
cheat
.
*NL*
If
still
he
wears
thy
borrowed
smiles
,
*NL*
And
still
unwary
truth
beguiles
,
*NL*
Soon
must
this
dark
terrestrial
ball
*NL*
Into
its
first
confusion
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
sudden
death
to
a
protracted
life
of
anguish
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
heavens
!
have
I
then
at
last
found
a
place
which
may
*NL*
afford
a
secret
grave
for

wretched
body
?
Yes
,
if
the
*NL*
silence
of
this
rocky
desert
deceive
me
not
,
here
I
may
die
*NL*
in
peace

Ah
,
woe
is
me
!
Here
at

I
may
freely
pour
*NL*
forth
my
lamentations
to
Heaven
,
and
shall
be
less
wretched
*NL*
than
among
men
,
from
whom
I
should
in
vain
seek
counsel
,
*NL*
redress
,
or
consolation

''
*NL*
*NL*
One
evil
produces
another
,
and
misfortunes
never
come
*NL*
singly
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
memory
,
thou
mortal
enemy
of
my
repose
!
wherefore
now
*NL*
recall
to
me
the
incomparable
beauty
of
that
adored
enemy
of
*NL*
mine
!
Were
it
not
better
,
thou
cruel
faculty
!
to
represent
*NL*
to
my
imagination
her
conduct
at
that
period

that
moved
by
*NL*
so
flagrant
an
injury
,
I
may
strive
if
not
to
avenge
it
,
at
*NL*
least
to
end
this
life
of
pain

*NL*
For
no
grievance
can
harass
or
drive
the
afflicted
to
such
*NL*
extremity
,

life
remains

as
to
make
them
shut
their
*NL*
ears
against
that
counsel
which
is
given
with
the
most
*NL*
humane
and
benevolent
intention

Music
lulls
the
disordered
thoughts

elevates

dejected
spirits

All
women

be
never

homely

are
pleased
to
hear

themselves
celebrated
for
beauty

The
eyes
of
love

of
idleness
are
like
those
of
a
lynx

*NL*
*NL*
One
mischance
invites
another
,
and
the
end
of
one
misfortune
*NL*
is
often
the
beginning
of
a
worse

``

ill-luck

*NL*
*NL*
A
man

should
be

as
cautious
respecting
the
friends
he
introduces
at

as
*NL*
to
her
female
acquaintance
abroad

*NL*

If
from
equal
parts

take
equal
parts

those
that
remain

*NL*
*NL*
To
attempt
voluntarily
that
which
must
be
productive
of
evil
*NL*
rather
than
good
,
is
madness
and
folly
.
Difficult
works
are
*NL*
undertaken
for
the
sake
of
Heaven
,
or
of
the
world
,
or
both
:
*NL*
the
first
are
such
as
are
performed
by
the
saints
while
they
*NL*
endeavor
to
live
the
life
of
angels
in
their
human
frames
;
*NL*
such
as
are
performed
for
love
of
the
world
are
encountered
*NL*
by
those
who
navigate
the
boundless
ocean
,
traverse
*NL*
different
countries
and
various
climates
to
acquire
what
are
*NL*
called
the
goods
of
fortune
.
Those
who
assail
hazardous
*NL*
enterprises
for
the
sake
of
both
God
and
man
are
brave
*NL*
soldiers
,
who
no
sooner
perceive
in
the
enemy
's
wall
a
*NL*
breach
made
by
a
single
cannon-ball
,
than
,
regardless
of
*NL*
danger
and
full
of
zeal
in
the
defence
of
their
faith
,
their
*NL*
country
,
and
their
king
,
they
rush
where
death
in
a
thousand
*NL*
shapes
awaits
them
.
These
are
difficulties
commonly
*NL*
attempted
,
and
,
though
perilous
,
are
glorious

TEARS
OF
ST.
PETER
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shame
,
grief
,
remorse
,
in
Peter
's
breast
increase
,
*NL*
Soon
as
the
blushing
morn
his
crime
betrays
;
*NL*
When
most
unseen
,
then
most
himself
he
sees
,
*NL*
And
with
due
horror
all
his
soul
surveys
.
*NL*
For
a
great
spirit
needs
no
censuring
eyes
*NL*
To
wound
his
soul
,
when
conscious
of
a
fault
;
*NL*
But
,
self-condemn
'd
,
and
e
`
en
self-punished
,
lies
,
*NL*
And
dreads
no
witness
like
upbraiding
Thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Expect
not
,
therefore
,
by
concealment
,
to
banish
sorrow
;
*NL*
for
,
even
though
you
weep
not
openly
,
tears
of
blood
will
*NL*
flow
from
your
heart
.
So
wept
that
simple
doctor
,
who
,
*NL*
according
to
the
poet
,
would
venture
to
make
a
trial
of
the
*NL*
cup
which
the
more
prudent
Rinaldo
wisely
declined
doing
;
*NL*
and
although
this
be
a
poetical
fiction
,
there
is
a
*NL*
concealed
moral
in
it
worthy
to
be
observed
and
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
jewel
in
the
world
so
valuable
as
a
chaste
and
*NL*
virtuous
woman
.
The
honor
of
women
consists
in
the
good
*NL*
opinion
of
the
world
;
and
since
that
of
your
wife
is
*NL*
eminently
good
,
why
would
you
have
it
questioned
?

*NL*
friend
,
is
an
imperfect
creature
;
and
,
instead
of
laying
*NL*
stumbling-blocks
in
her
way
,
we
should
clear
the
path
before
*NL*
her
,
that
she
may
readily
attain
that
virtue
which
is
*NL*
essential
in
her
.
Naturalists
inform
us
that
the
ermine
is
a
*NL*
little
creature
with
extremely
white
fur
,
and
that
when
the
*NL*
hunters
are
in
pursuit
of
it
,
they
spread
with
mire
all
the
*NL*
passes
leading
to
its
haunts
,
to
which
they
then
drive
it
,
*NL*
knowing
that
it
will
submit
to
be
taken
rather
than
defile
*NL*
itself
.
The
virtuous
and
modest
woman
is
an
ermine
,
and
her
*NL*
character
whiter
than
snow
;
and
in
order
to
preserve
it
,
a
*NL*
very
different
method
must
be
taken
from
that
which
is
used
*NL*
with
the
ermine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reputation
of
a
woman
may
also
be
compared
to
a
mirror
*NL*
of
crystal
,
shining
and
bright
,
but
liable
to
be
sullied
by
*NL*
every
breath
that
comes
near
it
.
The
virtuous
woman
must
be
*NL*
treated
like
a
relic
--
adored
but
not
handled
;
she
should
be
*NL*
guarded
and
prized
,
like
a
fine
flower-garden
,
the
beauty
*NL*
and
fragrance
of
which
the
owner
allows
others
to
enjoy
only
*NL*
at
a
distance
,
and
through
iron
rails
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
devil
,
when
he
would
entrap
a
cautious
person
,
assumes
*NL*
an
angel
form
till
he
carries
his
point
,
when
the
cloven
*NL*
foot
appears
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
builds
on
impossibilities
should
be
denied
the
*NL*
privilege
of
any
other
foundation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hope
is
ever
born
with
love

*NL*
*NL*
Castles
should
not
be
left
without
governors
,
nor
armies
*NL*
without
generals
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
passion
of
love
is
to
be
conquered
by
flight
alone
;
it
*NL*
is
vain
to
contend
with
a
power
which
,
though
human
,
*NL*
requires
more
than
human
strength
to
subdue
.

``
Certainly
,
gentlemen
,
if
we
rightly
consider
it
,
those
who
make
*NL*
knight-errantry
their
profession
often
meet
with
surprising
and
most
*NL*
stupendous
adventures
.
For
what
mortal
in
the
world
,
at
this
time
*NL*
entering
within
this
castle
,
and
seeing
us
sit
together
as
we
do
,
will
*NL*
imagine
and
believe
us
to
be
the
same
persons
which
in
reality
we
are
?
*NL*
Who
is
there
that
can
judge
that
this
lady
by
my
side
is
the
great
queen
*NL*
we
all
know
her
to
be
,
and
that
I
am
that
Knight
of
the
Sorrowful
Figure
*NL*
so
universally
made
known
by
fame
?
It
is
,
then
,
no
longer
to
be
doubted
*NL*
but
that
this
exercise
and
profession
surpasses
all
others
that
have
*NL*
been
invented
by
man
,
and
is
so
much
the
more
honorable
as
it
is
more
*NL*
exposed
to
dangers
.
Let
none
presume
to
tell
me
that
the
pen
is
*NL*
preferable
to
the
sword
.
This
may
be
ascertained
by
regarding
the
end
*NL*
and
object
each
of
them
aims
at
;
for
that
intention
is
to
be
most
valued
*NL*
which
makes
the
noblest
end
its
object
.
The
scope
and
end
of
learning
,
I
*NL*
mean
human
learning
-LRB-
in
this
place
I
speak
not
of
divinity
,
whose
aim
is
*NL*
to
guide
souls
to
Heaven
,
for
no
other
can
equal
a
design
so
infinite
as
*NL*
that
-RRB-
,
is
to
give
a
perfection
to
distribute
justice
,
bestowing
upon
*NL*
every
one
his
due
,
and
to
procure
and
cause
good
laws
to
be
observed
;
an
*NL*
end
really
generous
,
great
,
and
worthy
of
high
commendation
,
but
yet
not
*NL*
equal
to
that
which
knight-errantry
tends
to
,
whose
object
and
end
is
*NL*
peace
,
which
is
the
greatest
blessing
man
can
wish
for
in
this
life
.
*NL*
And
,
therefore
,
the
first
good
news
that
the
world
received
was
that
*NL*
which
the
angels
brought
in
the
night
--
the
beginning
of
our
day
--
when
*NL*
they
sang
in
the
air
,
`
Glory
to
God
on
high
,
peace
on
earth
,
and
to
men
*NL*
good-will
.
'
And
the
only
manner
of
salutation
taught
by
our
great
Master
*NL*
to
His
friends
and
favorites
was
,
that
entering
any
house
they
should
*NL*
say
,
`
Peace
be
to
this
house
.
'
And
at
other
times
He
said
to
them
,
`
My
*NL*
peace
I
give
to
you
,
'
`
My
peace
I
leave
to
you
,
'
`
Peace
be
among
you
.

A
*NL*
jewel
and
legacy
worthy
of
such
a
donor
,
a
jewel
so
precious
that
*NL*
without
it
there
can
be
no
happiness
either
in
earth
or
heaven
.
This
*NL*
peace
is
the
true
end
of
war
;
for
arms
and
war
are
one
and
the
same
*NL*
thing
.
Allowing
,
then
,
this
truth
,
that
the
end
of
war
is
peace
,
and
*NL*
that
in
this
it
excels
the
end
of
learning
,
let
us
now
weigh
the
bodily
*NL*
labors
the
scholar
undergoes
against
those
the
warrior
suffers
,
and
then
*NL*
see
which
are
the
greatest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
,
then
,
I
say
,
are
the
sufferings
and
hardships
a
scholar
endures
.
*NL*
First
,
poverty
-LRB-
not
that
they
are
all
poor
,
but
to
urge
the
worst
that
*NL*
may
be
in
this
case
-RRB-
;
and
having
said
he
endures
poverty
,
methinks
*NL*
nothing
more
need
be
urged
to
express
his
misery
;
for
he
that
is
poor
*NL*
enjoys
no
happiness
,
but
labors
under
this
poverty
in
all
its
parts
,
at
*NL*
one
time
in
hunger
,
at
another
in
cold
,
another
in
nakedness
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
in
all
of
them
together
;
yet
his
poverty
is
not
so
great
,
but
*NL*
still
he
eats
,
though
it
be
later
than
the
usual
hour
,
and
of
the
scraps
*NL*
of
the
rich
;
neither
can
the
scholar
miss
of
somebody
's
stove
or
*NL*
fireside
to
sit
by
;
where
,
though
he
be
not
thoroughly
heated
,
yet
he
*NL*
may
gather
warmth
,
and
at
last
sleep
away
the
night
under
a
roof
.
I
will
*NL*
not
touch
upon
other
less
material
circumstances
,
as
the
want
of
linen
,
*NL*
and
scarcity
of
shoes
,
thinness
and
baldness
of
their
clothes
,
and
their
*NL*
surfeiting
when
good
fortune
throws
a
feast
in
their
way
;
this
is
the
*NL*
difficult
and
uncouth
path
they
tread
,
often
stumbling
and
falling
,
yet
*NL*
rising
again
and
pushing
on
,
till
they
attain
the
preferment
they
aim
*NL*
at
;
whither
being
arrived
,
we
have
seen
many
of
them
,
who
,
having
been
*NL*
carried
by
a
fortunate
gale
through
all
these
quick-sands
,
from
a
chair
*NL*
govern
the
world
;
their
hunger
being
changed
into
satiety
,
their
cold
*NL*
into
comfortable
warmth
,
their
nakedness
into
magnificence
of
apparel
,
*NL*
and
the
mats
they
used
to
lie
upon
,
into
stately
beds
of
costly
silks
*NL*
and
softest
linen
,
a
reward
due
to
their
virtue
.
But
yet
their
*NL*
sufferings
,
being
compared
to
those
the
soldier
endures
,
appear
much
*NL*
inferior
,
as
I
shall
in
the
next
place
make
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
after
a
short
pause
,
continued
his
discourse
thus
:
--
``
Since
,
*NL*
in
speaking
of
the
scholar
,
we
began
with
his
poverty
and
its
several
*NL*
branches
,
let
us
see
whether
the
soldier
be
richer
.
We
shall
find
that
*NL*
poverty
itself
is
not
more
poor
:
for
he
depends
on
his
wretched
pay
,
*NL*
which
comes
late
,
and
sometimes
never
;
or
upon
what
he
can
pillage
,
at
*NL*
the
imminent
risk
of
his
life
and
conscience
.
Such
often
is
his
*NL*
nakedness
that
his
slashed
buff-doublet
serves
him
both
for
finery
and
*NL*
shirt
;
and
in
the
midst
of
winter
,
on
the
open
plain
,
he
has
nothing
to
*NL*
warm
him
but
the
breath
of
his
mouth
,
which
,
issuing
from
an
empty
*NL*
place
,
must
needs
be
cold
.
But
let
us
wait
,
and
see
whether
night
will
*NL*
make
amends
for
these
inconveniences
:
if
his
bed
be
too
narrow
it
is
his
*NL*
own
fault
,
for
he
may
measure
out
as
many
feet
of
earth
as
he
pleases
,
*NL*
and
roll
himself
thereon
at
pleasure
without
fear
of
rumpling
the
*NL*
sheets
.
Suppose
the
moment
arrived
of
taking
his
degree
--
I
mean
,
*NL*
suppose-the
day
of
battle
come
:
his
doctoral
cap
may
then
be
of
lint
,
to
*NL*
cover
some
gun-shot
wound
,
which
perhaps
has
gone
through
his
temples
,
*NL*
or
deprived
him
of
an
arm
or
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
even
suppose
that
Heaven
in
its
mercy
should
preserve
him
alive
and
*NL*
unhurt
,
he
will
probably
remain
as
poor
as
ever
;
for
he
must
be
engaged
*NL*
and
victorious
in
many
battles
before
he
can
expect
high
promotion
;
and
*NL*
such
good
fortune
happens
only
by
a
miracle
:
for
you
will
allow
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
that
few
are
the
number
of
those
that
have
reaped
the
reward
*NL*
of
their
services
,
compared
with
those
who
have
perished
in
war
.
The
*NL*
dead
are
countless
;
whereas
those
who
survived
to
be
rewarded
may
be
*NL*
numbered
with
three
figures
.
Not
so
with
scholars
,
who
by
their
salaries
*NL*
-LRB-
I
will
not
say
their
perquisites
-RRB-
are
generally
handsomely
provided
*NL*
for
.
Thus
the
labors
of
the
soldier
are
greater
,
although
his
reward
is
*NL*
less
.
It
may
be
said
in
answer
to
this
,
that
it
is
easier
to
reward
two
*NL*
thousand
scholars
than
thirty
thousand
soldiers
:
for
scholars
are
*NL*
rewarded
by
employments
which
must
of
course
be
given
to
men
of
their
*NL*
profession
;
whereas
the
soldier
can
only
be
rewarded
by
the
property
of
*NL*
the
master
whom
,
he
serves
;
and
this
defence
serves
to
strengthen
my
*NL*
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
waiving
this
point
,
let
us
consider
the
comparative
claims
to
*NL*
pre-eminence
:
for
the
partisans
of
each
can
bring
powerful
arguments
in
*NL*
support
of
their
own
cause
.
It
is
said
in
favor
of
letters
that
without
*NL*
them
arms
could
not
subsist
;
for
war
must
have
its
laws
,
and
laws
come
*NL*
within
the
province
of
the
learned
.
But
it
may
be
alleged
in
reply
,
that
*NL*
arms
are
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
law
;
by
arms
the
public
roads
*NL*
are
protected
,
cities
guarded
,
states
defended
,
kingdoms
preserved
,
and
*NL*
the
seas
cleared
of
corsairs
and
pirates
.
In
short
,
without
arms
there
*NL*
would
be
no
safety
for
cities
,
commonwealths
or
kingdoms
.
Besides
,
it
is
*NL*
just
to
estimate
a
pursuit
in
proportion
to
the
cost
of
its
attainment
.
*NL*
Now
it
is
true
that
eminence
in
learning
is
purchased
by
time
,
watching
,
*NL*
hunger
,
nakedness
,
vertigo
,
indigestion
,
and
many
other
inconveniences
*NL*
already
mentioned
;
but
a
man
who
rises
gradually
to
be
a
good
soldier
*NL*
endures
all
these
,
and
far
more
.
What
is
the
hunger
and
poverty
which
*NL*
menace
the
man
of
letters
compared
with
the
situation
of
the
soldier
,
*NL*
who
,
besieged
in
some
fortress
,
and
placed
as
sentinel
in
some
ravelin
*NL*
or
_
cavalier
_
,
perceives
that
the
enemy
is
mining
toward
the
place
where
*NL*
he
stands
,
and
yet
he
must
on
no
account
stir
from
his
post
or
shun
the
*NL*
imminent
danger
that
threatens
him
?
All
that
he
can
do
in
such
a
case
is
*NL*
to
give
notice
to
his
officer
of
what
passes
,
that
he
may
endeavor
to
*NL*
counteract
it
;
in
the
meantime
he
must
stand
his
ground
,
in
momentary
*NL*
expectation
of
being
mounted
to
the
clouds
without
wings
,
and
then
*NL*
dashed
headlong
to
the
earth
.
And
if
this
be
thought
but
a
trifling
*NL*
danger
,
let
us
see
whether
it
be
equalled
or
exceeded
by
the
encounter
*NL*
of
two
galleys
,
prow
to
prow
,
in
the
midst
of
the
white
sea
,
locked
and
*NL*
grappled
together
,
so
that
there
is
no
more
room
left
for
the
soldier
*NL*
than
the
two-foot
plank
at
the
break-head
;
and
though
he
sees
as
many
*NL*
threatening
ministers
of
death
before
him
as
there
are
pieces
of
*NL*
artillery
pointed
at
him
from
the
opposite
side
,
not
the
length
of
a
*NL*
lance
from
his
body
;
though
he
knows
that
the
first
slip
of
his
foot
*NL*
sends
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
;
yet
,
with
an
undaunted
heart
,
*NL*
inspired
by
honor
,
he
exposes
himself
as
a
mark
to
all
their
fire
,
and
*NL*
endeavors
by
that
narrow
pass
to
force
his
way
into
the
enemy
's
vessel
!
*NL*
And
,
what
is
most
worthy
of
admiration
,
no
sooner
is
one
fallen
,
never
,
*NL*
to
rise
again
in
this
world
,
than
another
takes
his
place
;
and
if
he
*NL*
also
fall
into
the
sea
,
which
lies
in
wait
to
devour
him
,
another
and
*NL*
another
succeeds
without
intermission
!
In
all
the
extremities
of
war
*NL*
there
is
no
example
of
courage
and
intrepidity
to
exceed
this
.
Happy
*NL*
those
ages
which
knew
not
the
dreadful
fury
of
artillery
!
--
those
*NL*
instruments
of
hell
-LRB-
where
,
I
verily
believe
,
the
inventor
is
now
*NL*
receiving
the
reward
of
his
diabolical
ingenuity
-RRB-
,
by
means
of
which
the
*NL*
cowardly
and
the
base
can
deprive
the
bravest
soldier
of
life
.
While
a
*NL*
gallant
spirit
animated
with
heroic
ardor
is
pressing
to
glory
,
comes
a
*NL*
chance
ball
,
sent
by
one
who
perhaps
fled
in
alarm
at
the
flash
of
his
*NL*
own
accursed
weapon
,
and
in
an
instant
cuts
short
the
life
of
him
who
*NL*
deserved
to
live
for
ages
!
When
I
consider
this
,
I
could
almost
repent
*NL*
having
undertaken
this
profession
of
knight-errantry
in
so
detestable
an
*NL*
age
;
for
though
no
danger
can
daunt
me
,
still
it
gives
me
some
concern
*NL*
to
think
that
powder
and
lead
may
suddenly
cut
short
my
career
of
glory
.
*NL*
But
Heaven
's
will
be
done
!
I
have
this
satisfaction
,
that
I
shall
*NL*
acquire
the
greater
fame
if
I
succeed
,
inasmuch
as
the
perils
by
which
I
*NL*
am
beset
are
greater
than
those
to
which
the
knights-errant
of
past
ages
*NL*
were
exposed

issue

but
the
truth

this
maxim
is
nowhere
more
*NL*
evinced
than
in

where
activity
and
despatch
anticipate

the
designs

the

obtain
the
victory
before

put

The

come
off

Fables
should
not
be
composed

outrage

by
making
the
wonderful
appear
possible

creating
in

the

a

both
surprise
and

entertain
;
which
can
not
be
effected
where
no
regard
is
paid

to

I
have
never
yet
found
a
regular
,
*NL*
well-connected
fable
in
any
of
our
books
of
chivalry
--
they
*NL*
are
all
inconsistent
and
monstrous
;
the
style
is
generally
*NL*
bad
;
and
they
abound
with
incredible
exploits
,
lascivious
*NL*
amours
,
absurd
sentiment
,
and
miraculous
adventures
;
in
*NL*
short
,
they
should
be
banished
every
Christian
country

*NL*

Just
are
virtue
's
fears

envy
domineers

will
not
stay

Fortune
turns
faster
than
a
mill-wheel
,
and
those
who
were
*NL*
yesterday
at
top
,
may
find
themselves
at
bottom
to-day

*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
is
the
son
of

*NL*
*NL*
The
mind
receives
pleasure
from
the
beauty
and
consistency
*NL*
of
what
is
presented
to
the
imagination
,
not
from
that
which
*NL*
is
incongruous
and
unnatural
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fiction
is
always
the
better
the
nearer
it
resembles
truth
,
*NL*
and
agreeable
in
proportion
to
the
probability
it
bears
and
*NL*
the
doubtful
credit
which
it
inspires
.
Wherefore
,
all
such
*NL*
fables
ought
to
be
suited
to
the
understanding
of
those
who
*NL*
read
them
,
and
written
so
as
that
,
by
softening
*NL*
impossibilities
,
smoothing
what
is
rough
,
and
keeping
the
*NL*
mind
in
suspense
,
they
may
surprise
,
agreeably
perplex
,
and
*NL*
entertain
,
creating
equal
admiration
and
delight
;
and
these
*NL*
never
can
be
excited
by
authors
who
forsake
probability
and
*NL*
imitation
,
in
which
the
perfection
of
writing
consists

*NL*
Epics
may
be
written

To
assert

never

Amadis
in

,
nor

any
other
of

so
many
records

is
to
say
that
the

the
frost
*NL*
produce
cold

nor
the
earth
yield
sustenance

approbation

had
better
be

foolish

Our
modern
plays
,
not
only
those
which
are
formed
upon
*NL*
fiction

but
likewise
such
as
are
founded
on
the
truth
of
*NL*
history
,
are
all
,
or
the
greatest
part
,
universally
known
to
*NL*
be
monstrous
productions
,
without
either
head
or
tail
,
and
*NL*
yet
received
with
pleasure
by
the
multitude
,
who
approve
and
*NL*
esteem
them
as
excellent
performances
,
though
they
are
far
*NL*
from
deserving
that
title
;
and
if
the
authors
who
compose
,
*NL*
and
the
actors
who
represent
them
,
affirm
that
this
and
no
*NL*
other
method
is
to
be
practised
,
because
the
multitude
must
*NL*
be
pleased
;
that
those
which
bear
the
marks
of
contrivance
,
*NL*
and
produce
a
fable
digested
according
to
the
rules
of
art
,
*NL*
serve
only
for
entertainment
to
four
or
five
people
of
*NL*
taste
,
who
discern
the
beauties
of
the
plan
,
which
utterly
*NL*
escape
the
rest
of
the
audience
;
and
that
it
is
better
for
*NL*
them
to
gain
a
comfortable
livelihood
by
the
many
,
than
*NL*
starve
upon
reputation
with
the
few
;
at
this
rate
,
said
I
,
*NL*
if
I
should
finish
my
book
,
after
having
scorched
every
hair
*NL*
in
my
whiskers
in
poring
over
it
,
to
preserve
those
rules
*NL*
and
precepts
already
mentioned
,
I
might
fare
at
last
like
*NL*
the
sagacious
botcher
,
who
sewed
for
nothing
and
found
his
*NL*
customers
in
thread
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
a
sufficient
excuse
to
say
that
the
object
in
*NL*
permitting
theatrical
exhibitions
being
chiefly
to
provide
*NL*
innocent
recreation
for
the
people
,
it
is
unnecessary
to
*NL*
limit
and
restrain
the
dramatic
author
within
strict
rules
*NL*
of
composition
;
for
I
affirm
that
the
same
object
is
,
beyond
*NL*
all
comparison
,
more
effectually
attained
by
legitimate
*NL*
works
.
The
spectator
of
a
good
drama
is
amused
,
admonished
,
*NL*
and
improved
by
what
is
diverting
,
affecting
,
and
moral
in
*NL*
the
representation
;
he
is
cautioned
against
deceit
,
*NL*
corrected
by
example
,
incensed
against
vice
,
stimulated
to
*NL*
the
love
of
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Comedy
,
according
to
Tully
,
ought
to
be
the
mirror
of
life
,
*NL*
the
exemplar
of
manners
,
and
picture
of
truth
;
whereas
those
*NL*
that
are
represented
in
this
age
are
mirrors
of
absurdity
,
*NL*
exemplars
of
folly
,
and
pictures
of
lewdness
;
for
sure
,
*NL*
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
in
a
dramatic
performance
,
than
*NL*
to
see
the
person
,
who
,
in
the
first
scene
of
the
first
*NL*
act
,
was
produced
a
child
in
swaddling-clothes
,
appear
a
*NL*
full-grown
man
with
a
beard
in
the
second
;
or
to
represent
*NL*
an
old
man
active
and
valiant
,
a
young
soldier
cowardly
,
a
*NL*
footman
eloquent
,
a
page
a
counsellor
,
a
king
a
porter
,
and
*NL*
a
princess
a
scullion
.
Then
what
shall
we
say
concerning
*NL*
their
management
of
the
time
and
place
in
which
the
actions
*NL*
have
,
or
may
be
supposed
to
have
happened
?
I
have
seen
a
*NL*
comedy
,
the
first
act
of
which
was
laid
in
Europe
,
the
*NL*
second
in
Asia
,
and
the
third
was
finished
in
Africa
;
nay
,
*NL*
had
there
been
a
fourth
,
the
scene
would
have
shifted
to
*NL*
America
,
so
that
the
fable
would
have
travelled
through
all
*NL*
the
four
divisions
of
the
globe
.
If
imitation
be
the
chief
*NL*
aim
of
comedy
,
how
can
any
ordinary
understanding
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
seeing
an
action
that
passed
in
the
time
of
*NL*
King
Pepin
and
Charlemagne
,
ascribed
to
the
Emperor
*NL*
Heraclius
,
who
,
being
the
principal
personage
,
is
*NL*
represented
,
like
Godfrey
of
Boulogne
,
carrying
the
cross
*NL*
into
Jerusalem
,
and
making
himself
master
of
the
holy
*NL*
sepulchre
,
an
infinite
number
of
years
having
passed
between
*NL*
the
one
and
the
other
?
Or
,
when
a
comedy
is
founded
upon
*NL*
fiction
,
to
see
scraps
of
real
history
introduced
,
and
facts
*NL*
misrepresented
both
with
regard
to
persons
and
times
,
not
*NL*
with
any
ingenuity
of
contrivance
,
but
with
the
most
*NL*
manifest
and
inexcusable
errors
and
stupidity
;
and
what
is
*NL*
worst
of
all
,
there
is
a
set
of
ignorant
pretenders
who
call
*NL*
this
the
perfection
of
writing
,
and
that
every
attempt
to
*NL*
succeed
by
a
contrary
method
is
no
other
than
a
wild-goose
*NL*
chase
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bow
can
not
remain
always
bent
;
and
relaxation
,
both
of
*NL*
body
and
mind
,
is
indispensable
to
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Can
you
deny
what
is
in
everybody
's
mouth
,
when
a
person
is
*NL*
in
the
dumps
?
It
is
always
then
said
,
``
I
know
not
what
such
*NL*
a
one
ails
--
he
neither
eats
,
nor
drinks
,
nor
sleeps
,
nor
*NL*
answers
to
the
purpose
,
like
other
men
--
surely
he
is
*NL*
enchanted
.
''
Wherefore
,
it
is
clear
that
such
,
and
such
only
,
*NL*
are
enchanted
who
neither
eat
,
nor
drink
,
nor
sleep
,
and
not
*NL*
they
who
eat
and
drink
when
they
can
get
it
,
and
answer
*NL*
properly
to
all
that
is
asked
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
man
is
unable
to
exercise
the
virtue
of
liberality
;
*NL*
and
the
gratitude
which
consists
only
in
inclination
is
a
*NL*
dead
thing
,
even
as
faith
without
works
is
dead
.
I
shall
,
*NL*
therefore
,
rejoice
when
fortune
presents
me
with
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
exalting
myself
,
that
I
may
show
my
heart
in
*NL*
conferring
benefits
on
my
friends
,
especially
on
poor
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
here
,
my
squire
,
who
is
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
*NL*
world
;
and
I
would
fain
bestow
on
him
an
earldom
,
as
I
have
*NL*
long
since
promised
;
although
I
am
somewhat
in
doubt
of
his
*NL*
ability
in
the
government
of
his
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
overhearing
his
master
's
last
words
,
said
:
``
Take
you
the
*NL*
trouble
,
Signor
Don
Quixote
,
to
procure
me
that
same
earldom
,
which
your
*NL*
worship
has
so
often
promised
,
and
I
have
been
so
long
waiting
for
,
and
*NL*
you
shall
see
that
I
shall
not
want
ability
to
govern
it
.
But
even
if
I
*NL*
should
,
there
are
people
,
I
have
heard
say
,
who
farm
these
lordships
;
*NL*
and
paying
the
owners
so
much
a
year
,
take
upon
themselves
the
*NL*
government
of
the
whole
,
while
his
lordship
lolls
at
his
ease
,
enjoying
*NL*
his
estate
,
without
concerning
himself
any
further
about
it
.
Just
so
*NL*
will
I
do
,
and
give
myself
no
more
trouble
than
needs
mast
,
but
enjoy
*NL*
myself
like
any
duke
,
and
let
the
world
rub
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
brother
Sancho
,
''
said
the
canon
,
``
may
be
done
,
as
far
as
regards
*NL*
the
management
of
your
revenue
;
but
the
administration
of
justice
must
*NL*
be
attended
to
by
the
lord
himself
,
and
requires
capacity
,
judgment
,
*NL*
and
,
above
all
,
an
upright
intention
,
without
which
nothing
prospers
;
*NL*
for
Heaven
assists
the
good
intent
of
the
simple
,
and
disappoints
the
*NL*
evil
designs
of
the
cunning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
these
philosophies
,
''
answered
Sancho
;
``
all
that
I
*NL*
know
is
,
that
I
wish
I
may
as
surely
have
the
earldom
as
I
should
know
*NL*
how
to
govern
it
;
for
I
have
as
large
a
soul
as
another
,
and
as
large
a
*NL*
body
as
the
best
of
them
;
and
I
should
be
as
much
king
of
my
own
*NL*
dominion
as
any
other
king
;
would
do
what
I
pleased
;
and
,
doing
what
I
*NL*
pleased
,
I
should
have
my
will
;
and
having
my
will
,
I
should
be
*NL*
contented
;
and
,
being
content
,
there
is
no
more
to
be
desired
;
and
when
*NL*
there
is
no
more
to
desire
,
there
is
an
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
no
bad
philosophies
,
as
you
say
,
Sancho
,
''
quoth
the
canon
;
*NL*
``
nevertheless
,
there
is
a
great
deal
more
to
be
said
upon
the
subject
of
*NL*
earldoms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
,
''
observed
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
I
am
guided
by
the
numerous
*NL*
examples
offered
on
this
subject
by
knights
of
my
own
profession
;
who
,
*NL*
in
compensation
for
the
loyal
and
signal
services
they
had
received
from
*NL*
their
squires
,
conferred
upon
them
extraordinary
favors
,
making
them
*NL*
absolute
lords
of
cities
and
islands
:
indeed
,
there
was
one
whose
*NL*
services
were
so
great
that
he
had
the
presumption
to
accept
of
a
*NL*
kingdom
.
But
why
should
I
say
more
,
when
before
me
is
the
bright
example
*NL*
of
the
great
Amadis
de
Gaul
,
who
made
his
squire
knight
of
the
Firm
*NL*
Island
?
Surely
I
may
,
therefore
,
without
scruple
of
conscience
,
make
an
*NL*
earl
of
Sancho
Panza
,
who
is
one
of
the
best
squires
that
ever
served
*NL*
knight-errant
.

*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
news
of
Don
Quixote
's
arrival
,
Sancho
Panza
's
wife
repaired
*NL*
thither
,
and
on
meeting
him
,
her
first
inquiry
was
whether
the
ass
had
*NL*
come
home
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
told
her
that
he
was
in
a
better
condition
than
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord
be
praised
,
''
replied
she
,
``
for
so
great
a
mercy
to
me
!
But
*NL*
tell
me
,
husband
,
what
good
have
you
got
by
your
squireship
?
Have
you
*NL*
brought
a
petticoat
home
for
me
,
and
shoes
for
your
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
brought
you
nothing
of
that
sort
,
dear
wife
,
''
quoth
Sancho
;
``
but
*NL*
I
have
got
other
things
of
greater
consequence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
of
that
,
''
answered
the
wife
,
``
pray
show
me
your
things
*NL*
of
greater
consequence

for
I
would
fain
see
them

gladden
my

heart

sad

the
long

have
been
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
see
them
at
home

''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
and
be
satisfied
at
*NL*
present
;
for
if
it
please
God
that
we
make
another
sally
in
quest
of
*NL*
adventures
,
you
will
soon
see
me
an
earl
or
governor
of
an
island
,

*NL*
no
common
one
either
,

one
of
the
best
that
is
to
be
had

*NL*
*NL*
``
Grant
Heaven
it
may
be
so

quoth
the
wife
,
``
for

enough
of
it

tell
me

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Honey
is
not

Sancho
:
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
Sancho

by
ladyship

answered
*NL*
Teresa
Panza
;
for
that
was
Sancho
's
wife
's
name
,
though
they
were
not
of
*NL*
kin
,
but
because
it
is
the
custom
in
La
Mancha
for
the
wife
to
take
the
*NL*
husband
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
in
so
much
haste
,
Teresa
,
to
know
all
this
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
let
*NL*
it
suffice
that
I
tell
you
the
truth
,
and
sew
up
your
mouth
.
But
for
the
*NL*
present
know
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
pleasant
to
an
honest
*NL*
man
,
as
to
be
squire
to
a
knight-errant
,
and
seeker
of
adventures
.
It
is
*NL*
true
indeed
,
most
of
them
are
not
so
much
to
a
man
's
mind
as
he
could
*NL*
wish
;
for
ninety-nine
of
a
hundred
one
meets
with
fall
out
cross
and
*NL*
unlucky
.
This
I
know
by
experience
;
for
I
have
sometimes
come
off
tossed
*NL*
in
a
blanket
,
and
sometimes
well
cudgelled
.
Yet
,
for
all
that
,
it
is
a
*NL*
fine
thing
to
be
in
expectation
of
accidents
,
traversing
mountains
,
*NL*
searching
woods
,
marching
over
rocks
,
visiting
castles
,
lodging
in
inns

*NL*

at
discretion

the
devil
a
farthing
to
pay

''
*NL*
*NL*
Fame
has
preserved
in
the
memoirs
of
La
Mancha
,
that
Don
Quixote
,
the
*NL*
third
time
he
sallied
from
home
,
went
to
Saragossa
,
where
he
was
present
*NL*
at
a
famous
tournament
in
that
city
,
and
that
there
befell
him
things
*NL*
worthy
of
his
valor
and
good
understanding
.
Nor
would
the
chronicler
*NL*
have
learned
any
thing
concerning
his
death
had
he
not
fortunately
*NL*
become
acquainted
with
an
aged
physician
,
who
had
in
his
custody
a
*NL*
leaden
box
,
found
,
as
he
said
,
under
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
hermitage
*NL*
then
rebuilding
:
in
which
box
was
found
a
manuscript
of
parchment
*NL*
written
in
Gothic
characters
,
but
in
Castilian
verse
,
containing
many
of
*NL*
his
exploits
,
and
giving
an
account
of
the
beauty
of
Dulcinea
del
*NL*
Toboso
,
the
figure
of
Rozinante
,
the
fidelity
of
Sancho
Panza
,
and
the
*NL*
burial
of
Don
Quixote
himself
,
with
several
epitaphs
and
eulogies
on
his
*NL*
life
and
manners
.
All
that
could
be
read
,
and
perfectly
made
out
,
were
*NL*
those
inserted
here
by
the
faithful
author
of
this
strange
and
*NL*
never-before-seen
history
;
which
author
desires
no
other
reward
from
*NL*
those
who
shall
read
it

recompense
of
the
vast
pains
it
has
cost
him
*NL*
to
inquire
into
and
search
all
the
archives
of
La

to
bring
it
to

light
,

that
they
would
afford
him
the
same
credit
that
ingenious
*NL*
people
give
to
books
of
knight-errantry
,
which
are
so
well
received
in

reckon
himself
well

A
SHORT
STORY
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
ONCE
IN
SEVILLE
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
man
,
being
deranged
in
his
intellects
,
was
placed
by
his
*NL*
relations
in
the
mad-house
of
Seville
.
He
had
taken
his
degrees
in
the
*NL*
canon
law
at
Ossuna
;
but
had
it
been
at
Salamanca
,
many
are
of
opinion
*NL*
he
would
,
nevertheless
,
have
been
mad
.
This
graduate
,
after
some
years
'
*NL*
confinement
,
took
into
his
head
that
he
was
quite
in
his
right
senses
,
*NL*
and
therefore
wrote
to
the
archbishop
,
beseeching
him
,
with
great
*NL*
earnestness
and
apparently
with
much
reason
,
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
*NL*
deliver
him
from
that
miserable
state
of
confinement
in
which
he
lived
;
*NL*
since
,
through
the
mercy
of
God
,
he
had
regained
his
senses
;
adding
that
*NL*
his
relations
,
in
order
to
enjoy
part
of
his
estate
,
kept
him
still
*NL*
there
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
clearest
evidence
,
would
insist
upon
his
*NL*
being
mad
as
long
as
he
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
archbishop
,
prevailed
upon
by
the
many
sensible
epistles
he
received
*NL*
from
him
,
sent
one
of
his
chaplains
to
the
keeper
of
the
mad-house
to
*NL*
inquire
into
the
truth
of
what
the
licentiate
had
alleged
,
and
also
to
*NL*
talk
with
him
,
and
if
it
appeared
that
he
was
in
his
senses
,
to
set
him
*NL*
at
liberty
.
The
chaplain
accordingly
went
to
the
rector
,
who
assured
him
*NL*
that
the
man
was
still
insane
,
for
though
he
sometimes
talked
very
*NL*
sensibly
,
it
was
seldom
for
any
length
of
time
without
betraying
his
*NL*
derangement
;
as
he
would
certainly
find
on
conversing
with
him
.
The
*NL*
chaplain
determined
to
make
the
trial
,
and
during
the
conversation
of
*NL*
more
than
an
hour
,
could
perceive
no
symptom
of
incoherence
in
his
*NL*
discourse
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
spoke
with
so
much
sedateness
and
*NL*
judgment
that
the
chaplain
could
not
entertain
a
doubt
of
the
sanity
of
*NL*
his
intellects
.
Among
other
things
he
assured
him
that
the
keeper
was
*NL*
bribed
by
his
relations
to
persist
in
reporting
him
to
be
deranged
;
so
*NL*
that
his
large
estate
was
his
great
misfortune
,
to
enjoy
which
his
*NL*
enemies
had
recourse
to
fraud
,
and
pretended
to
doubt
of
the
mercy
of
*NL*
Heaven
in
restoring
him
from
the
condition
of
a
brute
to
that
of
a
man
.
*NL*
In
short
,
he
talked
so
plausibly
that
he
made
the
rector
appear
venal
*NL*
and
corrupt
,
his
relations
unnatural
,
and
himself
so
discreet
that
the
*NL*
chaplain
determined
to
take
him
immediately
to
the
archbishop
,
that
he
*NL*
might
be
satisfied
he
had
done
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
resolution
the
good
chaplain
desired
the
keeper
of
the
house
*NL*
to
restore
to
him
the
clothes
which
he
wore
when
he
was
first
put
under
*NL*
his
care
.
The
keeper
again
desired
him
to
beware
what
he
did
,
since
he
*NL*
might
be
assured
that
the
licentiate
was
still
insane
;
but
the
chaplain
*NL*
was
not
to
be
moved
either
by
his
cautions
or
entreaties
;
and
as
he
*NL*
acted
by
order
of
the
archbishop
,
the
keeper
was
compelled
to
obey
him
.
*NL*
The
licentiate
put
on
his
new
clothes
,
and
now
,
finding
himself
rid
of
*NL*
his
lunatic
attire
,
and
habited
like
a
rational
creature
,
he
entreated
*NL*
the
chaplain
,
for
charity
's
sake
,
to
permit
him
to
take
leave
of
his
*NL*
late
companions
in
affliction
.
Being
desirous
of
seeing
the
lunatics
*NL*
who
were
confined
in
that
house
,
the
chaplain
,
with
several
other
*NL*
persons
,
followed
him
upstairs
,
and
heard
him
accost
a
man
who
lay
*NL*
stretched
in
his
cell
outrageously
mad
;
though
just
then
composed
and
*NL*
quiet
.
``
Brother
,
''
said
he
to
him
,
``
have
you
any
commands
for
me
?
for
I
*NL*
am
going
to
return
to
my
own
house
,
God
having
been
pleased
,
of
His
*NL*
infinite
goodness
and
mercy
,
without
any
desert
of
mine
,
to
restore
me
*NL*
to
my
senses
.
I
am
now
sound
and
well
,
for
with
God
nothing
is
*NL*
impossible
;
put
your
whole
trust
and
confidence
in
Him
,
and
he
will
*NL*
doubtless
restore
you
also
.
I
will
take
care
to
send
you
some
choice
*NL*
food
;
and
fail
not
to
eat
it
:
for
I
have
reason
to
believe
,
from
my
own
*NL*
experience
,
that
all
our
distraction
proceeds
from
empty
stomachs
,
and
*NL*
brains
filled
with
wind
.
Take
heart
,
then
,
my
friend
,
take
heart
;
for
*NL*
despondence
under
misfortune
impairs
our
health
,
and
hastens
our
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
discourse
was
overheard
by
another
madman
,
who
was
in
an
opposite
*NL*
cell
;
and
raising
himself
up
from
an
old
mat
,
whereon
he
had
thrown
*NL*
himself
stark
naked
,
he
demanded
aloud
,
who
it
was
that
was
going
away
*NL*
recovered
and
in
his
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
,
brother
,
''
answered
the
licentiate
,
``
that
am
going
;
for
I
need
*NL*
stay
no
longer
here
,
and
am
infinitely
thankful
to
heaven
for
having
*NL*
bestowed
so
great
a
blessing
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
heed
,
licentiate
,
what
you
say
,
let
not
the
devil
delude
you
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
madman
;
``
stir
not
a
foot
,
but
keep
where
you
are
,
and
you
*NL*
will
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
being
brought
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
replied
the
licentiate
,
``
that
I
am
perfectly
well
,
and
shall
*NL*
have
no
more
occasion
to
visit
the
station

.

*NL*
``
You

?
''
said
the
madman
;
``
we
shall
soon
see
that
;
farewell
!
but
I
*NL*
swear
by
Jupiter
,
whose
majesty
I
represent
on
earth
,
that
for
this
*NL*
offence
alone
,
which
Seville
is
now
committing
,
in
carrying
you
out
of
*NL*
this
house
,
and
judging
you
to
be
in
your
senses
,
I
am
determined
to
*NL*
inflict
such
a
signal
punishment
on
this
city
,
that
the
memory
thereof
*NL*
shall
endure

ever

Amen

Know
you
not

that
I
can
do

say
,
I
am

hold
in

hands
the
flaming
bolts

with

I
can

destroy

I
chastise

that
is

there
shall
no
rain

its
district

for
three
whole
years

reckoning
from
the
*NL*
day

hour
in
which
this
threatening
is
denounced
.
You
at

you

recovered
,
and
in
your
right
senses

and
I
a
madman
,
I
distempered
and
*NL*
in
bonds
!
I
will
no
more
rain
than
I
will
hang
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
bystanders
were
very
attentive
to
the
madman
's
discourse
:
but
*NL*
our
licentiate
,
turning
himself
to
our
chaplain
,
and
holding
him
by
both
*NL*
hands
,
said
to
him
:
``
Be
in
no
pain
,
good
sir
,
nor
make
any
account
of
*NL*
what
this
madman
has
said
;
for
,
if
he
is
Jupiter
and
will
not
rain
,
I
,
*NL*
who
am
Neptune
,
the
father
and
the
god
of
the
waters
,
will
rain
as
*NL*
often
as
I
please
,
and
whenever
there
shall
be
occasion
.
''
To
which
the
*NL*
chaplain
answered
:
``
However
,
signor
Neptune
,
it
will
not
be
convenient
*NL*
at
present
to
provoke
signor
Jupiter
;
therefore
,
pray
stay
where
you
*NL*
are
;
for
,
some
other
time
,
when
we
have
a
better
opportunity
and
more
*NL*
leisure
,
we
will
come
for
you
.
''
The
rector
and
the
bystanders
laughed
;
*NL*
which
put
the
chaplain
half
out
of
countenance
.
They
disrobed
the
*NL*
licentiate
,
who
remained
where
he
was
;
and
there
is
an
end
of
the
story

*NL*
``
True

they

consider
how

even

his

are
sometimes
thought

rather
an
improvement

it
can
not
be
denied
that
whoever

a

exposes
himself

nothing

Above

battle
it

have
to
tend
his

look
after
his
clothes

all
which
I
will
do

if

I

lay
hand

my

he

I

do
not
set

the
most
valiant

the
best
*NL*

most
faithful
squire
that
ever

if
my
lord
*NL*
Don

to
bestow
on

some
one
of

much
beholden

me
none

here
I
am

it

better

mayhap
my

down

I

have
no
government
!
and
yet
they
live
and
are
reckoned
among
*NL*
the
people
.
The
best
sauce
in
the
world
is
hunger
,
and
as
that
is
never
*NL*
wanting
to
the
poor
,
they
always
eat
with
a
relish
.
But
if
,
perchance
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
you
should
get
a
government
,
do
not
forget
me
and
your
children
.
*NL*
Consider
that
your
son
Sancho
is
just
fifteen
years
old
,
and
it
is
fit
*NL*
he
should
go
to
school
if
his
uncle
the
abbot
means
to
breed
him
up
to
*NL*
the
church
.
Consider
,
also
,
that
Mary
Sancha
,
your
daughter
,
will
not
*NL*
break
her
heart
if
we
marry
her
;
for
I
am
mistaken
if
she
has
not
as
*NL*
much
mind
to
a
husband
as
you
have
to
a
government
.
And
verily
say
I
,
*NL*
better
a
daughter
but
humbly
married
than
highly
kept
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
good
faith
,
dear
wife
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
if
Heaven
be
so
good
to
me
*NL*
that
I
get
anything
like
a
government
,
I
will
match
Mary
Sancha
so
*NL*
highly
that
there
will
be
no
coming
near
her
without
calling
her
your
*NL*
ladyship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
Sancho
,
''
answered
Teresa
,
``
the
best
way
is
to
marry
her
to
her
*NL*
equal
;
for
if
you
lift
her
from
clouted
shoes
to
high
heels
,
and
*NL*
instead
of
her
russet
coat
of
fourteenpenny
stuff
,
give
her
a
*NL*
farthingale
and
petticoats
of
silk
,
and
instead
of
plain
Molly
and
thou
*NL*
she
be
called
madam
and
your
ladyship
,
the
girl
will
not
know
where
she
*NL*
is

will
fall
into
a
thousand
mistakes
at
every
step
,
showing
her
*NL*
homespun
country
stuff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
,
fool
!
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
she
has
only
to
practise
two
or
three
*NL*
years
and
the
gravity
will
set
upon
her
as
if
it
were
made
for
her
;
and
*NL*
if
not
,
what
matters
it
?
Let
her
be
a
lady
,

come
of
it
what
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Measure
yourself
by
your
condition
,
Sancho
,
''
answered
Teresa
,
``
and
do
*NL*
not
seek
to
raise
yourself
higher

remember
the
proverb

`
Wipe
your
*NL*
neighbor
's
son
's
nose
and
take
him
into
your
house
.
'
It
would
be
a
*NL*
pretty
business
,
truly
,
to
marry
our
Mary
to
some
great
count
or
knight
,
*NL*
who
,
when
the
fancy
takes
him
,
would
look
upon
her
as
some
strange
*NL*
thing
,
and
be
calling
her
country-wench

clod-breaker
's
brat

I
know
*NL*
not
what
else

No
,
not
while
I
live

I
have
not
brought
up
my
*NL*
child

be
so
used

Do
you
provide
money
,
Sancho
,
and
leave
the
*NL*
matching
of
her
to
my
care
;
for
there
is
Lope
Tocho
,
John
Tocho
's
son

a
*NL*
lusty

hale
young
man
,
whom
we
know
,

I
am
sure
he
has
a
sneaking
*NL*
kindness
for
the
girl
.
To
him
she
will
be
very
well
married
,
considering
*NL*
he
is
our
equal
,
and
will
be
always
under
our
eye
;
and
we
shall
be
all
*NL*
as
one
,
parents

grandsons

sons-in-law
,

so
the
*NL*
peace

blessing
of
Heaven
will
be
among
us
all
;

do
not
you
be
for
*NL*
marrying
her
at
your
courts

great
palaces

where
they

neither

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark

replied
Sancho

you

now

at

it

spread
our

the
favorable
gale

blows

Ca

proceeded
*NL*
Sancho
,
``
that
I
shall
act
wisely

in
devoting
this
body

mine

some

beneficial

us
out
of
the
dirt

and
enable
me

match
Mary
Sancha

to
my

good
pleasure

then
wilt
thou

thyself

moping

circumstances

without
increase

diminution

like
a
picture
in

hangings

But
no

shall
be

cry
thy

out

*NL*
``
Look
before

Teresa

``
after
all

I
wish

this

you

I
'll
assure
you
it
shall
never
be
with
my
consent

good-will

I
*NL*
was
always
a
lover
of
equality
,
my
dear
,
and
ca
n't
bear
to
see
people
*NL*
hold
their
heads
high
without
reason

Teresa
was
I
christened
,
a
bare
*NL*
and
simple
name
,
without
the
addition
,
garniture
,
and
embroidery
of
Don
*NL*
or
Donna
;
my
father
's
name
is
Cascajo
,
and
mine
,
as
being
your
spouse
,
*NL*
Teresa
Panza
,
though
by
rights
I
should
be
called
Teresa
Cascajo

as

the

binds
;
and
with
that
name
am
I
contented

not
burdened
with
a
Don
,
which
weighs
so
heavy
that
I
should
not
*NL*

able
to
bear
it

Neither
will
I
put
it
in
the
power
of
those
who
see
*NL*
me
dressed
like
a
countess

governor
's
lady
,
to
say
:
`
Mind
Mrs.
*NL*
Porkfeeder
,
how
proud
she
looks
!
it
was
but
yesterday
she
toiled
hard
at
*NL*
the
distaff
,
and
went
to
mass
with
the
tail
of
her
gown
about
her
head
,
*NL*
instead
of
a
veil
;

now
,
forsooth

she
has
got
her
fine
farthingales

holds
up

If

seven

myself
into

you

He

*NL*
The
poor
man
is
scarcely
looked
at

every
eye
is

turned
upon

the

The

so
changed

poor

impressed

upon
the
imagination
with
much
greater
energy

force
,
*NL*
than
those
which
we
only
remember
to

When
we
see
any
person
finely
dressed

set
off
with
rich
*NL*
apparel

with
a

moved

show

respect

remember
certain
*NL*
scurvy
matters
either
of
poverty

that
formerly

tip-top

*NL*
well

generous

and
gives
himself
no

ridiculous
airs

with
the

*NL*
take
my
word
for
it
,
Teresa
,
nobody
will
twit
him
with
what
*NL*
he
was

will
respect
him

what
he

the
envious

the

To
this

women

*NL*
All
knights
can
not
be
courtiers
,
neither
can
all
courtiers
*NL*
be
knights
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
courtier
knight
travels
only
on
a
map
,
without
fatigue
*NL*
or
expense
;
he
neither
suffers
heat
nor
cold
,
hunger
nor
*NL*
thirst
;
while
the
true
knight-errant
explores
every
quarter
*NL*
of
the
habitable
world
,
and
is
by
night
and
day
,
on
foot
or
*NL*
on
horseback
,
exposed
to
all
the
vicissitudes
of
the
*NL*
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
are
not
affable
and
well-bred
;
on
the
contrary
,
some
*NL*
there
are
extremely
brutal
and
impolite
.
All
those
who
call
*NL*
themselves
knights
,
are
not
entitled
to
that
distinction
;
*NL*
some
being
of
pure
gold
,
and
others
of
baser
metal
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
denomination
they
assume
.
But
these
last
*NL*
can
not
stand
the
touch-stone
of
truth
;
there
are
mean
*NL*
plebeians
,
who
sweat
and
struggle
to
maintain
the
appearance
*NL*
of
gentlemen
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
there
are
gentlemen
of
*NL*
rank
who
seem
industrious
to
appear
mean
and
degenerate
;
the
*NL*
one
sort
raise
themselves
either
by
ambition
or
virtue
,
*NL*
while
the
other
abase
themselves
by
viciousness
or
sloth
;
so
*NL*
that
we
must
avail
ourselves
of
our
understanding
and
*NL*
discernment
in
distinguishing
those
persons
,
who
,
though
*NL*
they
bear
the
same
appellation
,
are
yet
so
different
in
*NL*
point
of
character
.
All
the
genealogies
in
the
world
may
be
*NL*
reduced
to
four
kinds
.
The
first
are
those
families
who
from
*NL*
a
low
beginning
have
raised
and
extended
themselves
,
until
*NL*
they
have
reached
the
highest
pinnacle
of
human
greatness
;
*NL*
the
second
are
those
of
high
extraction
,
who
have
preserved
*NL*
their
original
dignity
;
the
third
sort
are
those
who
,
from
a
*NL*
great
foundation
,
have
gradually
dwindled
,
until
,
like
a
*NL*
pyramid
,
they
terminate
in
a
small
point
.
The
last
,
which
*NL*
are
the
most
numerous
class
,
are
those
who
have
begun
and
*NL*
continue
low
,
and
who
must
end
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Genealogies
are
involved
in
endless
confusion
,
and
those
*NL*
only
are
illustrious
and
great
who
are
distinguished
by
*NL*
their
virtue
and
liberality
,
as
well
as
their
riches
;
for
*NL*
the
great
man
who
is
vicious
is
only
a
great
sinner
,
and
the
*NL*
rich
man
who
wants
liberality
is
but
a
miserly
pauper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gratification
which
wealth
can
bestow
is
not
in
mere
*NL*
possession
,
nor
in
lavishing
it
with
prodigality
,
but
in
the
*NL*
wise
application
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
knight
can
only
manifest
his
rank
by
his
virtues
*NL*
and
general
conduct
.
He
must
be
well-bred
,
courteous
,
kind
,
*NL*
and
obliging
;
not
proud
nor
arrogant
;
no
murmurer
.
Above
*NL*
all
,
he
must
be
charitable
,
and
by
two
maravedis
given
*NL*
cheerfully
to
the
poor
he
shall
display
as
much
generosity
*NL*
as
the
rich
man
who
bestows
large
alms
by
sound
of
bell
.
Of
*NL*
such
a
man
no
one
would
doubt
his
honorable
descent
,
and
*NL*
general
applause
wall
be
the
sure
reward
of
his
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
two
roads
by
which
men
may
attain
riches
and
*NL*
honor
:
the
one
by
letters
,
the
other
by
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
path
of
virtue
is
narrow
,
that
of
vice
is
spacious
and
*NL*
broad
;
as
the
great
Castilian
poet
expresses
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
these
rough
paths
of
toil
and
pain
*NL*
The
immortal
seats
of
bliss
we
gain
,
*NL*
Denied
to
those
who
heedless
stray
*NL*
In
tempting
pleasure
's
flowery
way
.

*NL*
*NL*
Fast
bind
,
fast
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
shuffles
is
not
he
who
cuts
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
there
is
little
in
a
woman

death

always

O

thou

The

Sancho

is
*NL*
attended
with
some
sort
of
delight
;

envy
produces

nothing

rage

rancor

*NL*
*NL*

The

shall
be

greater

that
which

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
grant

*NL*
``
Then

Sancho

``
the

this

they

themselves

the

``
Certainly

infer

quoth
*NL*
Don

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
mean

said
Sancho

is

that
we
had
better
turn

we
shall
then
soon
get

And
pray
take
notice
,
sir

that
it
was
but
yesterday
--
I
mean
very
*NL*
lately
--
a
couple
of
poor
barefooted
friars
were
canonized
,
and
people
*NL*
now
reckon
it
a
greater
happiness
to
touch
or
kiss
the
iron
chains
that
*NL*
bound
them
,
and
which
are
now
held
in
greater
veneration
than
Orlando

*NL*
sword
in
the
armory
of
our
lord
the
king
,
Heaven
save
him

so
that
it
is
*NL*
better
to
be
a
poor
friar
of
the
meanest
order
than
the
bravest
*NL*
knight-errant
,
because
four
dozen
of
good
penitent
lashes
are
more
*NL*
esteemed
in
the
sight
of
God

two
thousand
tilts
with
a
lance

it
be
against
giants

goblins

dragons

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
all
this
is
true
.
We
can
not
all
be
*NL*
friars

many

various
are
the
ways
by
which
God
conducts
his
*NL*
elect
to
Heaven

Chivalry
is
a
kind
of
religious
profession

some

knights
are
now
saints
in
glory

*NL*
*NL*
``
True

''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
but
I
have
heard
say
there
are
more
friars

Heaven

knights-errant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
well
be
so

replied
Don

,
``

their
number
is
much

greater

*NL*
*NL*
``

quoth
Sancho

One
tried
it
with
the

of

the
*NL*
other
only
put
it
to

The
first
said
the

savored
of

;

the

said
it
had
rather
a

of

The
owner

protested
that
the
vessel
was
clean
,
and
the
wine
neat
,
so
that
it
could
*NL*
not
taste
either
of
iron
or
leather
.
Notwithstanding
this
,
the
two
*NL*
famous
tasters
stood
positively
to
what
they
had
said

went
on

,
on
cleaning
the
cask
,
a
small
key
,
hanging
*NL*
to
a
leathern
thong

was
found
at
the
bottom
.
Judge
then
,
sir
,
whether
*NL*
one
of
that
race
may
not
be
well
entitled
to
give
his
opinion

DON
QUIXOTE
ON
POETRY
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poetry
I
regard
as
a
tender
virgin
,
young
and
extremely
beautiful
,
whom
*NL*
divers
other
virgins
--
namely
,
all
the
other
sciences
--
are
assiduous
to
*NL*
enrich
,
to
polish
,
and
adorn
.
She
is
to
be
served
by
them
,
and
they
are
*NL*
to
be
ennobled
through
her
.
But
the
same
virgin
is
not
to
be
rudely
*NL*
handled
,
nor
dragged
through
the
streets
,
nor
exposed
in
the
*NL*
market-places
,
nor
posted
on
the
corners
of
gates
of
palaces
.
She
is
of
*NL*
so
exquisite
a
nature
that
he
who
knows
how
to
treat
her
will
convert
*NL*
her
into
gold
of
the
most
inestimable
value
.
He
who
possesses
her
should
*NL*
guard
her
with
vigilance
;
neither
suffering
her
to
be
polluted
by
*NL*
obscene
,
nor
degraded
by
dull
and
frivolous
works
.
Although
she
must
be
*NL*
in
no
wise
venal
,
she
is
not
,
therefore
,
to
despise
the
fair
reward
of
*NL*
honorable
labors
,
either
in
heroic
or
dramatic
composition
.
Buffoons
*NL*
must
not
come
near
her
,
neither
must
she
be
approached
by
the
ignorant
*NL*
vulgar
,
who
have
no
sense
of
her
charms
;
and
this
term
is
equally
*NL*
applicable
to
all
ranks
,
for
whoever
is
ignorant
is
vulgar
.
He
,
*NL*
therefore
,
who
,
with
the
qualifications
I
have
named
,
devotes
himself
to
*NL*
poetry
,
will
be
honored
and
esteemed
by
all
nations
distinguished
for
*NL*
intellectual
cultivation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
it
is
generally
said
that
the
gift
of
poesy
is
innate
--
that
is
,
*NL*
a
poet
is
born
a
poet
,
and
,
thus
endowed
by
Heaven
,
apparently
without
*NL*
study
or
art
,
composes
things
which
verify
the
saying
,
_
Est
Deus
in
*NL*
nobis
_
,
etc.
.
Thus
the
poet
of
nature
,
who
improves
himself
by
art
,
rises
*NL*
far
above
him
who
is
merely
the
creature
of
study
.
Art
may
improve
,
but
*NL*
can
not
surpass
nature
;
and
,
therefore
,
it
is
the
union
of
both
which
*NL*
produces
the
perfect
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
him
direct
the
shafts
of
satire
against
vice
,
in
all
its
various
*NL*
forms
,
but
not
level
them
at
individuals
,
like
some
who
,
rather
than
not
*NL*
indulge
their
mischievous
wit
,
will
hazard
a
disgraceful
banishment
to
*NL*
the
Isles
of
Pontus
.
If
the
poet
be
correct
in
his
morals
,
his
verse
*NL*
will
partake
of
the
same
purity
:
the
pen
is
the
tongue
of
the
mind
,
and
*NL*
what
his
conceptions
are
,
such
will
be
his
productions
.
The
wise
and
*NL*
virtuous
subject
who
is
gifted
with
a
poetic
genius
is
ever
honored
and
*NL*
enriched
by
his
sovereign
,
and
crowned
with
the
leaves
of
the
tree
which
*NL*
the
thunderbolt
hurts
not
,
as
a
token
that
all
should
respect
those
*NL*
brows
which
are
so
honorably
adorned
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Forewarned
,
forearmed
;
to
be
prepared
is
half
the
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
nobler
sight
to
behold
a
knight-errant
assisting
a
*NL*
widow
in
solitude
than
a
courtier-knight
complimenting
a
*NL*
damsel
in
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
I
know
that
fortitude
is
a
virtue
placed
between
the
*NL*
two
extremes
of
cowardice
and
rashness
:
but
it
is
better
the
*NL*
valiant
should
rise
to
the
extreme
of
temerity
than
sink
to
*NL*
that
of
cowardice
,
for
,
as
it
is
easier
for
the
prodigal
*NL*
than
the
miser
to
become
liberal
,
so
it
is
much
easier
for
*NL*
the
rash
than
the
cowardly
to
become
truly
brave
.

*NL*
*NL*
THE
ADVENTURE
WITH
THE
LIONS
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
after
having
wiped
his
head
,
face
,
beard
,
and
helmet
,
again
*NL*
put
it
on
,
and
fixing
himself
firm
in
his
stirrups
,
adjusting
his
sword
,
*NL*
and
grasping
his
lance
,
he
exclaimed
,
``
Now
,
come
what
may
,
I
am
prepared
*NL*
to
encounter
Satan
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
soon
overtaken
by
the
cart
with
flags
,
which
was
attended
only
*NL*
by
the
driver
,
who
rode
upon
one
of
the
mules
,
and
a
man
sitting
upon
*NL*
the
fore
part
of
it
.
Don
Quixote
planted
himself
just
before
them
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Whither
go
ye
,
brethren
?
What
carriage
is
this
?
What
does
it
*NL*
contain
,
and
what
are
those
banners
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cart
is
mine
,
''
answered
the
carter
,
``
and
in
it
are
two
fierce
*NL*
lions
,
which
the
general
of
Oran
is
sending
to
court
as
a
present
to
his
*NL*
majesty
;
the
flags
belong
to
our
liege
the
king
,
to
show
that
what
is
in
*NL*
the
cart
belongs
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
the
lions
large
?
''
demanded
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Larger
never
came
from
Africa
to
Spain
,
''
said
the
man
on
the
front
of
*NL*
the
cart
;
``
I
am
their
keeper
,
and
in
my
time
have
had
charge
of
many
*NL*
lions
,
but
never
of
any
so
large
as
these
.
They
are
a
male
and
a
female
;
*NL*
the
male
is
in
the
first
cage
,
and
the
female
is
in
that
behind
.
Not
*NL*
having
eaten
to-day
,
they
are
now
hungry
and
therefore
,
sir
,
stand
*NL*
aside
,
for
we
must
make
haste
to
the
place
where
they
are
to
be
fed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
with
a
scornful
smile
,
``
lion-whelps
against
*NL*
me
!
Against
me
,
your
puny
monsters
!
and
at
this
time
of

By
yon
*NL*
blessed
sun
!
those
who
sent
them
hither
shall
see
whether
I
am

*NL*
be
scared

lions

Alight
,
honest
friend
!
and
,
since
you
are
their
*NL*
keeper
,
open
the
cages
and
turn
out
your
savages
of
the
desert
:
for
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
this
field
will
I
make
them
know
who
Don

de
la
*NL*

is
,
in

of
the
enchanters
that
sent
them
hither
to
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
so
,
''
quoth
the
gentleman
to
himself
,
``
our
good
knight
has
now
given
*NL*
us
a
specimen
of
what
he
is
;
doubtless
the
curds
have
softened
his
*NL*
skull
,
and
made
his
brains
mellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
now
coming
up
to
him
,
``
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
''
cried
he
,
``
hinder
*NL*
my
master
from
meddling
with

lions

for
if

will
tear
*NL*

to
pieces

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
then
,
is
your
master
so
mad

''
answered
the
gentleman
,
``
that

*NL*
really
fear

will
attack
such
fierce
animals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He

not

answered
Sancho
,
``
but
daring

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
make
him
desist

replied
the
gentleman
;
and
,
going
up
to
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
was
importuning
the
keeper
to
open
the
cages
,
``
Sir
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
Knights-errant
should
engage
in
adventures
that
,
at
least
,
afford
*NL*
some
prospect
of
success

and
not
such
as
are
altogether
desperate
;
for
*NL*
the
valor
which
borders
on
temerity
has
in
it
more
of
madness
than
*NL*
courage
.
Besides
,
sir
knight
,
these
lions
do
not
come
to
assail
you
:
*NL*
they
are
going
to
be
presented
to
his
majesty
;
and
it
is
,
therefore
,
*NL*
improper
to
detain
them
or
retard
their
journey

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sweet
sir
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
go
hence
,
and
mind
your
decoy
*NL*
partridge
,
and
your
stout
ferret
,
and
leave
every
one
to
his
functions

*NL*
This
is
mine
,
and
I
shall
see
whether
these
gentlemen
lions
will
come
*NL*
against
me
or
not

''
Then
,
turning
to
the
keeper
,
he
said
,
``
I
vow
to
*NL*
Heaven
,
Don
Rascal
,
if
thou
dost
not
instantly
open
the
cages

*NL*
lance
I
will
pin
thee

*NL*
*NL*
The
carter
seeing
that
the
armed
lunatic
was
resolute
,
``
Good
sir
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
for
charity
's
sake

be
pleased

let

take
off
my
mules
and
get
*NL*
with

out
of
danger
,
before
the
lions
are
let
loose
:
for
should
my
*NL*
cattle
be
killed
,
I
am
undone
for
ever
,
as
I
have
no
other
means
of
*NL*
living
than
by
this
cart
and
these
mules

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Incredulous
wretch

cried
Don
Quixote
,
``
unyoke
and
do
as
thou
wilt
;
*NL*
but
thou
shalt
soon
see
that
thy
trouble
might
have
been
spared

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carter
alighted
and
unyoked
in
great
haste
.
The
keeper
then
said
*NL*
aloud
,
``
Bear
witness
,
all
here
present
,
that
against
my
will
,
and
by
*NL*
compulsion
,
I
open
the
cages
and
let
the
lions
loose

I
protest
against
*NL*
what
this
gentleman
is
doing
,
and
declare
all
the
mischief
done
by
these
*NL*
beasts
shall
be
placed
to
his
account
,
with
my
salary
and
perquisites
*NL*
over
and
above
.
Pray
,
gentlemen
,
take
care
of
yourselves
before
I
open
*NL*
the
door
;
for
,
as
to
myself
,
I
am
sure
they
will
do
me
no
hurt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
gentleman
pressed
Don
Quixote
to
desist
from
so
mad
an
action
;
*NL*
declaring
to
him
that
he
was
thereby
provoking
God
's
wrath
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
replied
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
.
The
gentleman
rejoined
,
and
*NL*
entreated
him
to
consider
well
of
it
,
for
he
was
certainly
deceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
you
will
not
be
a
spectator
of
what
*NL*
you
think
will
prove
a
tragedy
,
spur
your
flea-bitten
,
and
save
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
too
,
besought
him
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
to
desist
from
an
*NL*
enterprise
compared
with
which
that
of
the
windmills
,
the
dreadful
one
*NL*
of
the
fulling-mills
,
and
in
short
,
all
the
exploits
he
had
performed
in
*NL*
the
whole
course
of
his
life
,
were
mere
tarts
and
cheesecakes
.
*NL*
``
Consider
,
sir
,
''
added
Sancho
,
``
here
is
no
enchantment
,
nor
anything
*NL*
like
it
;
for
I
saw
,
through
the
grates
and
chinks
of
the
cage
,
the
paw
*NL*
of
a
true
lion
;
and
I
guess
,
by
the
size
of
its
claw
,
that
it
is
bigger
*NL*
than
a
mountain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
fears
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
would
make
it
appear
to
thee
larger
*NL*
than
half
the
world
.
Retire
,
Sancho
,
and
leave
me
;
and
if
I
perish
here
,
*NL*
thou
knowest
our
old
agreement
:
repair
to
Dulcinea
--
I
say
no
more
.
''
To
*NL*
these
he
added
other
expressions
,
which
showed
the
firmness
of
his
*NL*
purpose
,
and
that
all
argument
would
be
fruitless
.
The
gentleman
would
*NL*
fain
have
compelled
him
to
desist
,
but
thought
himself
unequally
matched
*NL*
in
weapons
and
armor
,
and
that
it
Would
not
be
prudent
to
engage
with
a
*NL*
madman
,
whose
violence
and
menaces
against
the
keeper
were
now
*NL*
redoubled
;
the
gentleman
therefore
spurred
his
mare
,
Sancho
his
Dapple
,
*NL*
and
the
carter
his
mules
,
and
all
endeavored
to
get
as
far
off
as
*NL*
possible
from
the
cart
,
before
the
lions
were
let
loose
.
Sancho
bewailed
*NL*
the
death
of
his
master
;
verily
believing
it
would
now
overtake
him
*NL*
between
the
paws
of
the
lions
;
he
cursed
his
hard
fortune
,
and
the
*NL*
unlucky
hour
when
he
again
entered
into
his
service
.
But
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
his
tears
and
lamentations
,
he
kept
urging
on
his
Dapple
*NL*
to
get
far
enough
from
the
cart
.
The
keeper
,
seeing
that
the
fugitives
*NL*
were
at
a
good
distance
,
repeated
his
arguments
and
entreaties
,
but
to
*NL*
no
purpose
:
Don
Quixote
answered
that
he
heard
him
,
and
desired
he
would
*NL*
trouble
himself
no
more
,
but
immediately
obey
his
commands
,
and
open
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
the
keeper
was
unbarring
the
first
gate
,
Don
Quixote
deliberated
*NL*
within
himself
whether
it
would
be
best
to
engage
on
horseback
or
not
,
*NL*
and
finally
determined
it
should
be
on
foot
,
as
Rozinante
might
be
*NL*
terrified
at
the
sight
of
the
lions
.
He
therefore
leaped
from
his
horse
,
*NL*
flung
aside
his
lance
,
braced
on
his
shield
,
and
drew
his
sword
;
and
*NL*
marching
slowly
,
with
marvellous
intrepidity
and
an
undaunted
heart
,
he
*NL*
planted
himself
before
the
car
,
devoutly
commending
himself
,
first
to
*NL*
God
and
then
to
his
mistress
Dulcinea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
author
of
this
faithful
history
,
coming
*NL*
to
this
passage
,
falls
into
exclamations
,
and
cries
out
,
O
strenuous
and
*NL*
beyond
all
expression
courageous
Don
Quixote
de
la
Mancha
!
thou
mirror
*NL*
wherein
all
the
valiant
ones
of
the
world
may
behold
themselves
,
thou
*NL*
second
and
new
Don
Manuel
de
Leon
,
who
was
the
glory
and
honor
of
the
*NL*
Spanish
knights
!
With
what
words
shall
I
relate
this
tremendous
exploit
?
*NL*
By
what
arguments
shall
I
render
it
credible
to
succeeding
ages
?
or
what
*NL*
praises
,
though
above
all
hyperboles
hyperbolical
,
do
not
fit
and
become
*NL*
thee
?
Thou
,
alone
,
on
foot
,
intrepid
and
magnanimous
,
with
a
single
*NL*
sword
,
and
that
none
of
the
sharpest
,
with
a
shield
not
of
the
brightest
*NL*
and
most
shining
steel
,
standest
waiting
for
and
expecting
two
of
the
*NL*
fiercest
lions
that
the
forests
of
Africa
ever
bred
.
Let
thy
own
deeds
*NL*
praise
thee
,
valorous
Manchegan
!
for
here
I
must
leave
off
for
want
of
*NL*
words
whereby
to
enhance
them
.
Here
the
author
ends
his
exclamation
,
and
*NL*
resumes
the
thread
of
the
history
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
keeper
,
seeing
Don
Quixote
fixed
in
his
posture
,
and
that
he
could
*NL*
not
avoid
letting
loose
the
male
lion
on
pain
of
falling
under
the
*NL*
displeasure
of
the
angry
and
daring
knight
,
set
wide
open
the
door
of
*NL*
the
first
cage
,
where
lay
the
lion
,
which
appeared
to
be
of
an
*NL*
extraordinary
bigness
and
of
a
hideous
and
frightful
aspect
.
The
first
*NL*
thing
he
did
was
to
turn
himself
round
in
the
cage
,
reach
out
a
paw
,
and
*NL*
stretch
himself
at
full
length
.
Then
he
gaped
and
yawned
very
leisurely
;
*NL*
then
licked
the
dust
off
his
eyes
,
and
washed
his
face
,
with
some
half
a
*NL*
yard
of
tongue
.
This
done
,
he
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
cage
and
stared
*NL*
round
on
all
sides
with
eyes
of
fire-coals
,
--
a
sight
and
aspect
enough
*NL*
to
have
struck
terror
into
temerity
itself
.
Don
Quixote
only
observed
*NL*
him
with
attention
,
wishing
he
would
leap
out
from
the
car
and
grapple
*NL*
with
him
,
that
he
might
tear
him
in
pieces
,
to
such
a
pitch
of
*NL*
extravagance
had
his
unheard-of
madness
transported
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
generous
lion
,
more
civil
than
arrogant
,
taking
no
notice
of
his
*NL*
vaporing
and
bravados
,
after
having
stared
about
him
,
as
has
been
said
,
*NL*
turned
his
back
and
showed
his
posteriors
to
Don
Quixote
,
and
with
*NL*
great
phlegm
and
calmness
laid
himself
down
again
in
the
cage
;
which
Don
*NL*
Quixote
perceiving
,
he
ordered
the
keeper
to
give
him
some
blows
and
*NL*
provoke
him
to
come
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
not
do
,
''
answered
the
keeper
;
``
for
,
should
I
provoke
him
,
I
*NL*
myself
shall
be
the
first
he
will
tear
in
pieces
.
Be
satisfied
,
signor
*NL*
cavalier
,
with
what
is
done
,
which
is
all
that
can
be
said
in
point
of
*NL*
courage
,
and
do
not
tempt
fortune
a
second
time
.
The
lion
has
the
door
*NL*
open
,
and
it
is
in
his
choice
to
come
forth
or
not
;
and
since
he
has
not
*NL*
yet
come
out
,
he
will
not
come
out
all
this
day
.
The
greatness
of
your
*NL*
worship
's
courage
is
already
sufficiently
shown
.
No
brave
combatant
,
as
*NL*
I
take
it
,
is
obliged
to
more
than
to
challenge
his
foe
,
and
expect
him
*NL*
in
the
field
;
and
if
the
antagonist
does
not
meet
him
,
the
disgrace
*NL*
falls
on
him
,
while
the
challenger
is
entitled
to
the
crown
of
victory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
``
shut
the
door
,
and
give
me
a
*NL*
certificate
in
the
best
form
you
can
of
what
you
have
here
seen
me
*NL*
perform
.
It
should
be
known
that
you
opened
the
door
to
the
lion
;
that
I
*NL*
waited
for
him
;
that
he
came
not
out
;
again
I
waited
for
him
;
again
he
*NL*
came
not
out
;
and
again
he
laid
himself
down
.
I
am
bound
to
no
*NL*
more
,
--
enchantments
avaunt
!
So
Heaven
prosper
right
and
justice
and
true
*NL*
chivalry
!
Shut
the
door
,
as
I
told
thee
,
while
I
make
a
signal
to
the
*NL*
fugitive
and
absent
,
that
from
your
own
mouth
they
may
have
an
account
*NL*
of
this
exploit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
keeper
closed
the
door
,
and
Don
Quixote
,
having
fixed
the
linen
*NL*
cloth
with
which
he
had
wiped
the
curds
from
his
face
upon
the
point
of
*NL*
his
lance
,
began
to
hail
the
troop
in
the
distance
,
who
,
with
the
*NL*
gentleman
in
green
at
their
head
,
were
still
retiring
,
but
looking
round
*NL*
at
every
step
,
when
suddenly
Sancho
observed
the
signal
of
the
white
*NL*
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
be
hanged
,
''
cried
he
,
``
if
my
master
has
not
vanquished
the
wild
*NL*
beasts
,
for
he
is
calling
to
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
stopped
,
and
saw
that
it
was
Don
Quixote
that
made
the
sign
;
*NL*
and
,
their
fear
in
some
degree
abating
,
they
ventured
to
return
slowly
*NL*
till
they
could
distinctly
hear
the
words
of
Don
Quixote
,
who
continued
*NL*
calling
to
them
.
When
they
had
reached
the
cart
again
,
Don
Quixote
said
*NL*
to
the
driver
:
``
Now
,
friend
,
put
on
your
mules
again
,
and
in
Heaven
's
*NL*
name
proceed
;
and
,
Sancho
,
give
two
crowns
to
him
and
the
keeper
,
to
*NL*
make
them
amends
for
this
delay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
,
with
all
my
heart
,
''
answered
Sancho
;
``
but
what
has
become
*NL*
of
the
lions
?
are
they
dead
or
alive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
keeper
then
very
minutely
,
and
with
due
pauses
,
gave
an
account
of
*NL*
the
conflict
,
enlarging
,
to
the
best
of
his
skill
,
on
the
valor
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
at
sight
of
whom
the
daunted
lion
would
not
,
or
durst
not
,
stir
*NL*
out
of
the
cage
,
though
he
had
held
open
the
door
a
good
while
;
and
,
*NL*
upon
his
representing
to
the
knight
that
it
was
tempting
God
to
provoke
*NL*
the
lion
,
and
to
force
him
out
,
he
had
at
length
,
very
reluctantly
,
*NL*
permitted
him
to
close
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sayest
thou
to
this
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
can
any
*NL*
enchantment
prevail
against
true
courage
?
Enchanters
may
,
indeed
,
*NL*
deprive
me
of
good
fortune
,
but
of
courage
and
resolution
they
never
*NL*
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
gave
the
gold
crowns
;
the
carter
yoked
his
mules
;
the
keeper
*NL*
thanked
Don
Quixote
for
his
present
,
and
promised
to
relate
this
*NL*
valorous
exploit
to
the
king
himself
when
he
arrived
at
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
,
perchance
,
his
majesty
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
should
inquire
who
*NL*
performed
it
,
tell
him
the
Knight
of
the
Lions
;
for
henceforward
I
*NL*
resolve
that
the
title
I
have
hitherto
borne
,
of
the
Knight
of
the
*NL*
Sorrowful
Figure
,
shall
be
thus
changed
,
converted
,
and
altered
;
and
*NL*
herein
I
follow
the
ancient
practice
of
knights-errant
,
who
changed
*NL*
their
names
at
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
gallant
sight
to
see
a
cavalier
in
shining
armor
prancing
over
*NL*
the
lists
at
some
gay
tournament
in
sight
of
the
ladies
;
it
is
a
gallant
*NL*
sight
when
,
in
the
middle
of
a
spacious
square
,
a
brave
cavalier
,
before
*NL*
the
eyes
of
his
prince
,
transfixes
with
his
lance
a
furious
bull
;
and
a
*NL*
gallant
show
do
all
those
knights
make
,
who
,
in
military
or
other
*NL*
exercises
,
entertain
,
enliven
,
and
do
honor
to
their
prince
's
court
;
but
*NL*
far
above
all
these
is
the
knight-errant
,
who
,
through
deserts
and
*NL*
solitudes
,
through
cross-ways
,
through
woods
,
and
over
mountains
,
goes
*NL*
in
quest
of
perilous
adventures
,
which
he
undertakes
and
accomplishes
*NL*
only
to
obtain
a
glorious
and
immortal
fame
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
knights
have
their
peculiar
functions
.
Let
the
courtier
serve
the
*NL*
ladies
,
adorn
his
prince
's
court
with
rich
liveries
,
entertain
the
*NL*
poorer
cavaliers
at
his
splendid
table
,
order
his
jousts
,
manage
*NL*
tournaments
,
and
show
himself
great
,
liberal
,
and
magnificent
;
above
*NL*
all
,
a
good
Christian
,
and
thus
will
he
fulfil
his
duties
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
enterprises
of
every
kind
,
it
is
better
to
lose
the
game
by
a
card
*NL*
too
much
than
one
too
little
;
for
it
sounds
better
to
be
called
rash
and
*NL*
daring
than
timorous
and
cowardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signor
Don
Diego
de
Miranda
,
your
father
,
sir
,
has
informed
me
of
the
*NL*
rare
talents
you
possess
,
and
particularly
that
you
are
a
great
poet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
a
great
poet
,
''
replied
Lorenzo
;
``
it
is
true
I
am
fond
of
*NL*
poetry
,
and
honor
the
works
of
good
poets
;
but
I
have
no
claim
to
the
*NL*
title

father
is
pleased
to
confer
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
dislike
this
modesty
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
poets
are
*NL*
usually
very
arrogant
,
each
thinking
himself
the
greatest
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
rule
without
an
exception

''
answered
Don
Lorenzo
;
``
and
*NL*
surely
there
may
be
some
who
do
not
appear
too
conscious
of
their
real
*NL*
merits

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

*NL*
THE
SCIENCE
OF
KNIGHT-ERRANTRY
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
science
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
which
comprehends
all
,
or
most
*NL*
of
the
other
sciences
;
for
he
who
professes
it
must
be
learned
in
the
*NL*
law
,
and
understand
distributive
and
commutative
justice
,
that
he
may
*NL*
know
not
only
how
to
assign
to
each
man
what
is
truly
his
own
,
but
what
*NL*
is
proper
for
him
to
possess
;
he
must
be
conversant
in
divinity
,
in
*NL*
order
to
be
able
to
explain
,
clearly
and
distinctly
,
the
Christian
faith
*NL*
which
he
professes
;
he
must
be
skilled
in
medicine
,
especially
in
*NL*
botany
,
that
he
may
know
both
how
to
cure
the
diseases
with
which
he
may
*NL*
be
afflicted
,
and
collect
the
various
remedies
which
Providence
has
*NL*
scattered
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
,
nor
be
compelled
on
every
*NL*
emergency
to
be
running
in
quest
of
a
physician
to
heal
him
;
he
must
be
*NL*
an
astronomer
,
that
he
may
if
necessary
ascertain
by
the
stars
the
exact
*NL*
hour
of
the
night
and
what
part
or
climate
of
the
world
he
is
in
;
he
*NL*
must
understand
mathematics
,
because
he
will
have
occasion
for
them
;
and
*NL*
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
must
be
adorned
with
all
the
cardinal
and
*NL*
theological
virtues
,
I
descend
to
other
more
minute
particulars
,
and
say
*NL*
that
he
must
know
how
to
swim
as
well
as
it
is
reported
of
Fish
*NL*
Nicholas
;
-LSB-
9
-RSB-
he
must
know
how
to
shoe
a
horse
and
repair
his
saddle
and
*NL*
bridle
:
and
to
return
to
higher
concerns
,
he
must
preserve
his
faith
*NL*
inviolable
towards
Heaven
,
and
also
to
his
mistress
;
he
must
be
chaste
*NL*
in
his
thoughts
,
modest
in
his
words
,
liberal
in
good
works
,
valiant
in
*NL*
exploits
,
patient
in
toils
,
charitable
to
the
needy
,
and
steadfastly
*NL*
adhering
to
the
truth
,
even
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
.
Of
all
these
*NL*
great
and
small
parts
a
good
knight-errant
is
composed

Come

you
will
see
one
of
the
greatest
and

weddings
*NL*
that

ever
been
celebrated

*NL*
``
The
nuptials
of
some

I
presume
?
''
said
Don

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
scholar
,
``
only
that
of
a
farmer
and
a
country
maid
:
he
*NL*
the
wealthiest
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
and
she
the
most
beautiful
*NL*
that
eyes
ever
beheld
.
The
preparations
are
very
uncommon
:
for
the
*NL*
wedding
is
to
be
celebrated
in
a
meadow
near
the
village
where
the
bride
*NL*
lives
,
who
is
called
Quiteria
the
Fair
,
and
the
bridegroom
Camacho
the
*NL*
Rich
:
she
is
about
the
age
of
eighteen
,
and
he
twenty-two
,
both
equally
*NL*
matched
,
though
some
nice
folks
,
who
have
all
the
pedigrees
of
the
world
*NL*
in
their
heads
,
pretend
that
the
family
of
Quiteria
the
Fair
has
the
*NL*
advantage
over
that
of
Camacho
;
but
that
is
now
little
regarded
,
for
*NL*
riches
are
able
to
solder
up
abundance
of
flaws
.
In
short
,
this
same
*NL*
Camacho
is
as
liberal
as
a
prince
;
and
,
intending
to
be
at
some
cost
in
*NL*
this
wedding
,
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
convert
a
whole
meadow
into
*NL*
a
kind
of
arbor
,
shading
it
so
that
the
sun
itself
will
find
some
*NL*
difficulty
to
visit
the
green
grass
beneath
.
He
will
also
have
*NL*
morris-dances
,
both
with
swords
and
bells
;
for
there
are
people
in
the
*NL*
village
who
jingle
and
clatter
them
with
great
dexterity
.
As
to
the
*NL*
number
of
shoe-clappers
-LSB-
10
-RSB-
invited
,
it
is
impossible
to
count
them
;
but
*NL*
what
will
give
the
greatest
interest
to
this
wedding
is
the
effect
it
*NL*
is
expected
to
have
on
the
slighted
Basilius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
Basilius
is
a
swain
of
the
same
village
as
Quiteria
;
his
house
is
*NL*
next
to
that
of
her
parents
,
and
separated
only
by
a
wall
,
whence
Cupid
*NL*
took
occasion
to
revive
the
ancient
loves
of
Pyramus
and
Thisbe
:
for
*NL*
Basilius
was
in
love
with
Quiteria
from
his
childhood
,
and
she
returned
*NL*
his
affection
with
a
thousand
modest
favors
,
insomuch
that
the
loves
of
*NL*
the
two
children
,
Basilius
and
Quiteria
,
became
the
common
talk
of
the
*NL*
village
.
When
they
were
grown
up
,
the
father
of
Quiteria
resolved
to
*NL*
forbid
Basilius
the
usual
access
to
his
family
;
and
to
relieve
himself
*NL*
of
all
fears
on
his
account
,
he
determined
to
marry
his
daughter
to
the
*NL*
rich
Camacho
;
not
choosing
to
bestow
her
on
Basilius
,
whose
endowments
*NL*
are
less
the
gifts
of
fortune
than
of
nature
:
in
truth
he
is
the
most
*NL*
active
youth
we
know
;
a
great
pitcher
of
the
bar
,
an
excellent
wrestler
,
*NL*
a
great
player
at
cricket
,
runs
like
a
buck
,
leaps
like
a
wild
goat
,
and
*NL*
plays
at
ninepins
as
if
by
witchcraft
;
sings
like
a
lark
,
and
touches
a
*NL*
guitar
delightfully
and
,
above
all
,
he
handles
a
sword
like
the
most
*NL*
skilful
fencer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
now
began
to
grow
dark
,
and
as
they
approached
the
village
there
*NL*
appeared
before
them
a
new
heaven
,
blazing
with
innumerable
stars
.
At
*NL*
the
same
time
they
heard
the
sweet
and
mingled
sounds
of
various
*NL*
instruments
--
such
as
flutes
,
tambourines
,
psalters
,
cymbals
,
drums
,
and
*NL*
bells
;
and
,
drawing
still
nearer
,
they
perceived
a
spacious
arbor
,
*NL*
formed
near
the
entrance
into
the
town
,
hung
round
with
lights
that
*NL*
shone
undisturbed
by
the
breeze
;
for
it
was
so
calm
that
not
a
leaf
was
*NL*
seen
to
move
.
The
musicians
,
who
are
the
life
and
joy
of
such
festivals
,
*NL*
paraded
in
bands
up
and
down
this
delightful
place
,
some
dancing
,
others
*NL*
singing
,
and
others
playing
upon
different
instruments
:
in
short
,
*NL*
nothing
was
there
to
be
seen
but
mirth
and
pleasure
.
Several
were
*NL*
employed
in
raising
scaffolds
,
from
which
they
might
commodiously
behold
*NL*
the
shows
and
entertainments
of
the
following
day
,
that
were
to
be
*NL*
dedicated
to
the
nuptial
ceremony
of
the
rich
Camacho
and
the
obsequies
*NL*
of
poor
Basilius
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
is
poor
he
can
not
think
to
wed
Quiteria
.
A
pleasant
fancy
,
*NL*
forsooth
,
for
a
fellow
who
has
not
a
groat
in
his
pocket
to
look
for
a
*NL*
yoke-mate
above
the
clouds
.
Faith
,
sir
,
in
my
opinion
a
poor
man
should
*NL*
be
contented
with
what
he
finds
,
and
not
be
seeking
for
truffles
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
that
presented
itself
to
Sancho
's
sight
was
a
whole
*NL*
bullock
spitted
upon
a
large
elm
.
The
fire
it
was
roasted
by
was
*NL*
composed
of
a
middling
mountain
of
wood
,
and
round
it
were
placed
six
*NL*
pots
,
not
cast
in
common
moulds
;
for
they
were
half-jars
,
each
*NL*
containing
a
whole
shamble
of
flesh
;
and
entire
sheep
were
sunk
and
*NL*
swallowed
up
in
them
,
as
commodiously
as
if
they
were
only
so
many
*NL*
pigeons
.
The
hares
ready
cased
,
and
the
fowls
ready
plucked
,
that
hung
*NL*
about
upon
the
branches
,
in
order
to
be
buried
in
the
caldrons
,
were
*NL*
without
number
.
Infinite
was
the
wild
fowl
and
venison
hanging
about
the
*NL*
trees
,
that
the
air
might
cool
them
.
Sancho
counted
above
threescore
*NL*
skins
,
each
of
above
twenty-four
quarts
,
and
all
,
as
appeared
*NL*
afterwards
,
full
of
generous
wines
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
also
piles
of
the
whitest
bread
,
arranged
like
heaps
of
wheat
*NL*
on
the
threshing-floor
,
and
cheeses
,
piled
up
in
the
manner
of
bricks
,
*NL*
formed
a
kind
of
wall
.
Two
caldrons
of
oil
,
larger
than
dyers
'
vats
,
*NL*
stood
ready
for
frying
all
sorts
of
batter-ware
;
and
,
with
a
couple
of
*NL*
stout
peels
,
they
shovelled
them
up
when
fried
,
and
forthwith
immersed
*NL*
them
in
a
kettle
of
prepared
honey
that
stood
near
.
The
men
and
women
*NL*
cooks
were
about
fifty
in
number
,
all
clean
,
all
active
,
and
all
in
good
*NL*
humor
.
In
the
bullock
's
distended
belly
were
sewed
up
a
dozen
sucking
*NL*
pigs
,
to
make
it
savory
and
tender
.
The
spices
of
various
kinds
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
have
been
bought
,
not
by
the
pound
,
but
by
the
hundredweight
,
*NL*
were
deposited
in
a
great
chest
,
and
open
to
every
hand
.
In
short
the
*NL*
preparation
for
the
wedding
was
all
rustic
,
but
in
sufficient
abundance
*NL*
to
have
feasted
an
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
beheld
all
with
wonder
and
delight
.
The
first
that
captivated
and
*NL*
subdued
his
inclinations
were
the
flesh-pots
,
out
of
which
he
would
have
*NL*
been
glad
to
have
filled
a
moderate
pipkin
;
next
the
wine-skins
drew
his
*NL*
affections
;
and
lastly
the
products
of
the
frying-pans
--
if
such
*NL*
capacious
vessels
might
be
so
called
;
and
,
being
unable
any
longer
to
*NL*
abstain
,
he
ventured
to
approach
one
of
the
busy
cooks
,
and
in
*NL*
persuasive
and
hungry
terms
begged
leave
to
sop
a
luncheon
of
bread
in
*NL*
one
of
the
pots
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
cook
answered
,
``
This
,
friend
,
is
not
a
day
for
hunger
to
be
*NL*
abroad
--
thanks
to
rich
Camacho
.
Alight
,
and
look
about
you
for
a
ladle
*NL*
to
skim
out
a
fowl
or
two
,
and
much
good
may
they
do
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
no
ladle
,
''
answered
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
''
said
the
cook
.
``
Heaven
save
me
,
what
a
helpless
varlet
!
''
So
*NL*
saying
,
he
laid
hold
of
a
kettle
,
and
sousing
it
into
one
of
the
*NL*
half-jars
,
he
fished
out
three
pullets
and
a
couple
of
geese
,
and
said
*NL*
to
Sancho
,
``
Eat
,
friend
,
and
make
your
breakfast
of
this
scum
,
to
stay
*NL*
your
stomach
till
dinner-time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nothing
to
put
it
in
,
''
answered
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
take
ladle
and
all
,
''
quoth
the
cook
;
``
for
Camacho
's
riches
and
joy
*NL*
supply
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Sancho
was
thus
employed
,
Don
Quixote
stood
observing
the
entrance
*NL*
of
a
dozen
peasants
at
one
side
of
the
spacious
arbor
,
each
mounted
on
a
*NL*
beautiful
mare
,
in
rich
and
gay
caparisons
,
hung
round
with
little
*NL*
bells
.
They
were
clad
in
holiday
apparel
,
and
in
a
regular
troop
made
*NL*
sundry
careers
about
the
meadow
,
with
a
joyful
Moorish
cry
of
``
Long
live
*NL*
Camacho
and
Quiteria
!
he
as
rich
as
she
is
fair
,
and
she
the
fairest
of
*NL*
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
hearing
this
,
said
to
himself
,
``
These
people
,
it
is
plain
,
*NL*
have
never
seen
my
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
;
otherwise
they
would
have
been
*NL*
less
extravagant
in
the
praise
of
their
Quiteria
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
there
entered
,
on
different
sides
of
the
arbor
,
various
sets
*NL*
of
dancers
,
among
which
was
one
consisting
of
four-and-twenty
*NL*
sword-dancers
;
handsome
,
sprightly
swains
,
all
arrayed
in
fine
white
*NL*
linen
,
and
handkerchiefs
wrought
with
several
colors
of
fine
silk
.
One
*NL*
of
those
mounted
on
horseback
inquired
of
a
young
man
who
led
the
*NL*
sword-dance
,
whether
any
of
his
comrades
were
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
youth
;
``
thank
Heaven
,
as
yet
we
are
all
well
;
''
and
*NL*
instantly
he
twined
himself
in
among
his
companions
with
so
many
turns
,
*NL*
and
so
dexterously
,
that
though
Don
Quixote
had
often
seen
such
dances
*NL*
before
,
none
had
ever
pleased
him
so
well
.
Another
dance
also
delighted
*NL*
him
much
,
performed
by
twelve
damsels
,
young
and
beautiful
,
all
clad
in
*NL*
green
stuff
of
Cuenza
,
having
their
hair
partly
plaited
,
and
partly
*NL*
flowing
,
all
of
golden
hue
,
rivalling
the
sun
itself
,
and
covered
with
*NL*
garlands
of
jessamine
,
roses
and
woodbine
.
They
were
led
up
by
a
*NL*
venerable
old
man
and
an
ancient
matron
,
to
whom
the
occasion
had
given
*NL*
more
agility
than
might
have
been
expected
from
their
years
.
A
Zamora
*NL*
bagpipe
regulated
their
motions
,
which
being
no
less
sprightly
and
*NL*
graceful
than
their
looks
were
modest
and
maidenly
,
more
lovely
dancers
*NL*
were
never
seen
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pantomimic
dance
now
succeeded
,
by
eight
nymphs
,
divided
into
two
*NL*
ranks
--
``
Cupid
''
leading
the
one
,
and
``
Interest
,
''
the
other
;
the
former
*NL*
equipped
with
wings
,
bow
,
quiver
,
and
arrows
;
the
latter
gorgeously
*NL*
apparelled
with
rich
and
variously
colored
silks
,
embroidered
with
gold
.
*NL*
The
nymphs
in
Cupid
's
band
displayed
their
names
,
written
in
large
*NL*
letters
on
their
backs
.
``
Poetry
''
was
the
first
:
then
succeeded
*NL*
``
Discretion
,
''
``
Good
Lineage
,
''
and
``
Valor
.
''
The
followers
of
``
Interest
''
*NL*
were
``
Liberality
,
''
``
Bounty
,
''
``
Wealth
,
''
and
``
Security
.
''
This
band
was
*NL*
preceded
by
a
wooden
castle
,
drawn
by
savages
,
clad
so
naturally
in
ivy
*NL*
and
green
cloth
,
coarse
and
shaggy
,
that
Sancho
was
startled
.
On
the
*NL*
front
and
sides
of
the
edifice
was
written
,
``
The
Castle
of
Reserve
.
''
*NL*
Four
skilful
musicians
played
on
the
tabor
and
pipe
;
Cupid
began
the
*NL*
dance
,
and
after
two
movements
,
he
raised
his
eyes
,
and
bending
his
bow
,
*NL*
pointed
an
arrow
towards
a
damsel
that
stood
on
the
battlements
of
the
*NL*
castle
;
at
the
same
time
addressing
to
her
the
following
verses
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
CUPID
'S
ADDRESS
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
the
god
whose
power
extends
*NL*
Through
the
wide
ocean
,
earth
,
and
sky
;
*NL*
To
my
soft
sway
all
nature
bends
,
*NL*
Compelled
by
beauty
to
comply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fearless
I
rule
,
in
calm
and
storm
,
*NL*
Indulge
my
pleasure
to
the
full
;
*NL*
Things
deemed
impossible
perform
,
*NL*
Bestow
,
resume
,
ordain
,
annul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cupid
,
having
finished
his
address
,
shot
an
arrow
over
the
castle
,
and
*NL*
retired
to
his
station
;
upon
which
Interest
stepped
forth
,
and
after
two
*NL*
similar
movements
,
the
music
ceasing
,
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
power
exceeds
the
might
of
love
,
*NL*
For
Cupid
bows
to
me
alone
;
*NL*
Of
all
things
framed
by
heaven
above
,
*NL*
The
most
respected
,
sought
,
and
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
name
is
Interest
;
mine
aid
*NL*
But
few
obtain
,
though
all
desire
:
*NL*
Yet
shall
thy
virtue
,
beauteous
maid
,
*NL*
My
constant
services
acquire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Interest
then
withdrew
,
and
Poetry
advanced
;
and
,
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
*NL*
damsel
of
the
castle
,
she
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Let
Poetry
,
whose
strain
divine
*NL*
The
wondrous
power
of
song
displays
,
*NL*
Her
heart
to
thee
,
fair
nymph
,
consign
,
*NL*
Transported
in
melodious
lays
:
*NL*
*NL*
If
haply
thou
wilt
not
refuse
*NL*
To
grant
my
supplicated
boon
,
*NL*
Thy
fame
shall
,
wafted
by
the
muse
,
*NL*
Surmount
the
circle
of
the
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poetry
having
retired
from
the
side
of
Interest
,
Liberality
advanced
;
*NL*
and
,
after
making
her
movements
,
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
name
is
Liberality
,
*NL*
Alike
beneficent
and
wise
,
*NL*
To
shun
wild
prodigality
,
*NL*
And
sordid
avarice
despise
.
*NL*
Yet
,
for
thy
favor
lavish
grown
,
*NL*
A
prodigal
I
mean
to
prove
;
*NL*
An
honorable
vice
I
own
,
*NL*
But
giving
is
the
test
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
all
the
figures
of
the
two
parties
advanced
and
*NL*
retreated
,
and
each
made
its
movements
and
recited
its
verses
,
some
*NL*
elegant
,
and
some
ridiculous
of
which
Don
Quixote
,
who
had
a
very
good
*NL*
memory
,
treasured
up
the
foregoing
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
bridal
pair
proceeded
towards
a
theatre
on
one
side
of
the
arbor
,
*NL*
decorated
with
tapestry
and
garlands
,
where
the
nuptial
ceremony
was
to
*NL*
be
performed
,
and
whence
they
were
to
view
the
dances
and
shows
*NL*
prepared
for
the
occasion
.
Immediately
on
their
arrival
at
that
place
,
a
*NL*
loud
noise
was
heard
at
a
distance
,
amidst
which
a
voice
was
*NL*
distinguished
calling
aloud
,
``
Hold
a
little
,
rash
and
thoughtless
*NL*
people
!
''
On
turning
their
heads
they
saw
that
these
words
were
uttered
*NL*
by
a
man
who
was
advancing
towards
them
,
clad
in
a
black
doublet
,
welted
*NL*
with
flaming
crimson
.
He
was
crowned
with
a
garland
of
mournful
cypress
,
*NL*
and
held
in
his
hand
a
large
truncheon
;
and
,
as
he
drew
near
,
all
*NL*
recognized
the
gallant
Basilius
,
and
waited
in
fearful
expectation
of
*NL*
some
disastrous
result
from
this
unseasonable
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
came
up
,
tired
and
out
of
breath
,
and
placed
himself
just
*NL*
before
the
betrothed
couple
;
then
,
pressing
his
staff
,
which
was
pointed
*NL*
with
steel
,
into
the
ground
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
Quiteria
,
and
in
a
*NL*
broken
and
tremulous
voice
thus
addressed
her
:
``
Ah
,
false
and
forgetful
*NL*
Quiteria
,
well
thou
knowest
that
,
by
the
laws
of
our
holy
religion
,
thou
*NL*
canst
not
marry
another
man
whilst
I
am
living
;
neither
art
thou
*NL*
ignorant
that
,
while
waiting
till
time
and
mine
own
industry
should
*NL*
improve
my
fortune
,
I
have
never
failed
in
the
respect
due
to
thy
honor
.
*NL*
But
thou
hast
cast
aside
every
obligation
due
to
my
lawful
love
,
and
art
*NL*
going
to
make
another
man
master
of
what
is
mine
:
a
man
who
is
not
only
*NL*
enriched
,
but
rendered
eminently
happy
by
his
wealth
;
and
,
in
obedience
*NL*
to
the
will
of
Heaven
,
the
only
impediment
to
his
supreme
felicity
I
*NL*
will
remove
,
by
withdrawing
this
wretched
being
.
Long
live
the
rich
*NL*
Camacho
with
the
ungrateful
Quiteria
!
Long
and
happily
may
they
live
,
*NL*
and
let
poor
Basilius
die
,
who
would
have
risen
to
good
fortune
had
not
*NL*
poverty
clipped
his
wings
and
laid
him
in
an
early
grave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
plucked
his
staff
from
the
ground
,
and
,
drawing
out
a
*NL*
short
tuck
,
to
which
it
had
served
as
a
scabbard
,
he
fixed
what
might
be
*NL*
called
the
hilt
into
the
ground
,
and
,
with
a
nimble
spring
and
resolute
*NL*
air
,
he
threw
himself
on
the
point
,
which
,
instantly
appearing
at
his
*NL*
back
,
the
poor
wretch
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
,
pierced
through
and
*NL*
through
,
and
weltering
in
his
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friends
,
struck
with
horror
and
grief
,
rushed
forward
to
help
him
,
*NL*
and
Don
Quixote
,
dismounting
,
hastened
also
to
lend
his
aid
,
and
taking
*NL*
the
dying
man
in
his
arms
,
found
that
he
was
still
alive
.
They
would
*NL*
have
drawn
out
the
tuck
,
but
the
priest
who
was
present
thought
that
it
*NL*
should
not
be
done
till
he
had
made
his
confession
;
as
,
the
moment
it
*NL*
was
taken
out
of
his
body
he
would
certainly
expire
.
But
Basilius
,
not
*NL*
having
quite
lost
the
power
of
utterance
,
in
a
faint
and
doleful
voice
*NL*
said
:
``
If
,
cruel
Quiteria
,
in
this
my
last
and
fatal
agony
,
thou
wouldst
*NL*
give
me
thy
hand
,
as
my
spouse
,
I
should
hope
my
rashness
might
find
*NL*
pardon
in
heaven
,
since
it
procured
me
the
blessing
of
being
thine
.
''
*NL*
Upon
which
the
priest
advised
him
to
attend
rather
to
the
salvation
of
*NL*
his
soul
than
to
his
bodily
appetites
,
and
seriously
implore
pardon
of
*NL*
God
for
his
sins
,
especially
for
this
last
desperate
action
.
Basilius
*NL*
replied
that
he
could
not
make
any
confession
till
Quiteria
had
given
*NL*
him
her
hand
in
marriage
as
that
would
be
a
solace
to
his
mind
,
and
*NL*
enable
him
to
confess
his
sins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
hearing
the
wounded
man
's
request
,
said
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
*NL*
that
Basilius
had
made
a
very
just
and
reasonable
request
,
and
,
*NL*
moreover
,
a
very
practicable
one
;
and
that
it
would
be
equally
honorable
*NL*
for
Signor
Camacho
to
take
Quiteria
,
a
widow
of
the
brave
Basilius
,
as
*NL*
if
he
received
her
at
her
father
's
hand
;
nothing
being
required
but
the
*NL*
simple
word
,
``
Yes
,
''
which
could
be
of
no
consequence
,
since
,
in
these
*NL*
espousals
,
the
nuptial
bed
must
be
the
grave
.
Camacho
heard
all
this
,
*NL*
and
was
perplexed
and
undecided
what
to
do
or
say
;
but
so
much
was
he
*NL*
importuned
by
the
friends
of
Basilius
to
permit
Quiteria
to
give
him
her
*NL*
hand
,
and
thereby
save
his
soul
from
perdition
,
that
they
at
length
*NL*
moved
,
nay
forced
him
to
say
that
if
it
pleased
Quiteria
to
give
it
to
*NL*
him
,
he
should
not
object
,
since
it
was
only
delaying
for
a
moment
the
*NL*
accomplishment
of
his
wishes
.
They
all
immediately
applied
to
Quiteria
,
*NL*
and
,
with
entreaties
,
tears
,
and
persuasive
arguments
,
pressed
and
*NL*
importuned
her
to
give
her
hand
to
Basilius
;
but
she
,
harder
than
*NL*
marble
,
and
more
immovable
than
a
statue
,
returned
no
answer
,
until
the
*NL*
priest
told
her
that
she
must
decide
promptly
,
as
the
soul
of
Basilius
*NL*
was
already
between
his
teeth
,
and
there
was
no
time
for
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
beautiful
Quiteria
,
in
silence
,
and
to
all
appearance
troubled
*NL*
and
sad
,
approached
Basilius
,
whose
eyes
were
already
turned
in
his
*NL*
head
,
and
he
breathed
short
and
quick
,
muttering
the
name
of
Quiteria
,
*NL*
and
giving
tokens
of
dying
more
like
a
heathen
than
a
Christian
.
At
*NL*
last
Quiteria
,
kneeling
down
by
him
,
made
signs
to
him
for
his
hand
.
*NL*
Basilius
unclosed
his
eyes
,
and
fixing
them
steadfastly
upon
her
,
said
*NL*
``
O
Quiteria
!
thou
relentest
at
a
time
when
thy
pity
is
a
sword
to
put
a
*NL*
final
period
to
this
wretched
life
;
for
now
I
have
not
strength
to
bear
*NL*
the
glory
thou
conferrest
upon
me
in
making
me
thine
,
nor
will
it
*NL*
suspend
the
pain
which
shortly
will
veil
my
eyes
with
the
dreadful
*NL*
shadow
of
death
.
What
I
beg
of
thee
,
O
fatal
star
of
mine
!
is
that
thou
*NL*
give
not
thy
hand
out
of
compliment
,
or
again
to
deceive
me
,
but
to
*NL*
declare
that
thou
bestowest
it
upon
me
as
thy
lawful
husband
,
without
*NL*
any
compulsion
on
thy
will
--
for
it
would
be
cruel
in
this
extremity
to
*NL*
deal
falsely
or
impose
on
him
who
has
been
so
true
to
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
fainted
,
and
the
bystanders
thought
his
soul
was
just
departing
.
*NL*
Quiteria
,
all
modesty
and
bashfulness
,
taking
Basilius
's
right
hand
in
*NL*
hers
,
said
:
``
No
force
would
be
sufficient
to
bias
my
will
;
and
*NL*
therefore
,
with
all
the
freedom
I
have
,
I
give
thee
my
hand
to
be
thy
*NL*
lawful
wife
,
and
receive
thine
,
if
it
be
as
freely
given
,
and
if
the
*NL*
anguish
caused
by
thy
rash
act
doth
not
trouble
and
prevent
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
give
it
thee
,
''
answered
Basilius
,
``
neither
discomposed
nor
*NL*
confused
,
but
with
the
clearest
understanding
that
Heaven
was
ever
*NL*
pleased
to
bestow
on
me
;
and
so
I
give
and
engage
myself
to
be
thy
*NL*
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
to
be
thy
wife
,
''
answered
Quiteria
,
``
whether
thou
livest
many
*NL*
years
,
or
art
carried
from
my
arms
to
the
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
one
so
much
wounded
,
''
observed
Sancho
,
``
this
young
man
talks
a
*NL*
great
deal
.
Advise
him
to
leave
off
his
courtship
and
mind
the
business
*NL*
of
his
soul
;
though
to
my
thinking
he
has
it
more
on
his
tongue
than
*NL*
between
his
teeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Basilius
and
Quiteria
being
thus
,
with
hands
joined
,
the
tender-hearted
*NL*
priest
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
pronounced
the
benediction
upon
them
,
*NL*
and
prayed
to
Heaven
for
the
repose
of
the
bridegroom
's
soul
;
who
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
had
received
the
benediction
,
suddenly
started
up
,
and
nimbly
*NL*
drew
out
the
tuck
which
was
sheathed
in
his
body
.
All
the
spectators
*NL*
were
astonished
,
and
some
more
simple
than
the
rest
cried
out
``
A
*NL*
miracle
,
a
miracle
!
''
But
Basilius
replied
,
``
no
miracle
,
no
miracle
,
but
*NL*
a
stratagem
,
a
stratagem
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
,
astonished
and
confounded
,
ran
to
feel
,
with
both
his
hands
,
*NL*
the
wound
,
and
found
that
the
sword
had
passed
,
not
through
Basilius
's
*NL*
flesh
and
ribs
,
but
through
a
hollow
iron
pipe
,
cunningly
fitted
to
the
*NL*
place
,
and
filled
with
blood
,
so
prepared
as
not
to
congeal
.
In
short
,
*NL*
the
priests
,
Camacho
,
and
the
rest
of
the
spectators
,
found
they
were
*NL*
imposed
upon
,
and
completely
duped
.
The
bride
showed
no
signs
of
regret
*NL*
at
the
artifice
:
on
the
contrary
,
hearing
it
said
the
marriage
,
as
being
*NL*
fraudulent
,
was
not
valid
,
she
said
that
she
confirmed
it
anew
;
it
was
,
*NL*
therefore
,
generally
supposed
that
the
matter
had
been
concerted
with
*NL*
the
privity
and
concurrence
of
both
parties
;
which
so
enraged
Camacho
*NL*
and
his
friends
that
they
immediately
had
recourse
to
vengeance
,
and
*NL*
unsheathing
abundance
of
swords
they
fell
upon
Basilius
,
in
whose
*NL*
behalf
as
many
more
were
instantly
drawn
,
and
Don
Quixote
,
leading
the
*NL*
van
on
horseback
,
his
lance
upon
his
arm
,
and
well
covered
with
his
*NL*
shield
,
made
them
all
give
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
cried
aloud
,
``
Hold

It
is
not
right
to
avenge
*NL*
the
injuries
committed
against
us
by
love
.
Remember
that
the
arts
of
*NL*
warfare
and
courtship
are
in
some
points
alike
;
in
war
,
stratagems
are
*NL*
lawful
,
so
likewise
are
they
in
the
conflicts
and
rivalships
of
love
,
if
*NL*
the
means
employed
be
not
dishonorable
.
Quiteria
and
Basilius
were
*NL*
destined
for
each
other
by
the
just
and
favoring
will
of
Heaven
.
Camacho
*NL*
is
rich
,
and
may
purchase
his
pleasure
when
,
where
and
how
he
pleases
.
*NL*
Basilius
has
but
this
one
ewe-lamb
;
and
no
one
,
however
powerful
,
has
a
*NL*
right
to
take
it
from
him
;
for
those
whom
God
hath
joined
let
no
man
*NL*
sunder
,
and
whoever
shall
attempt
it
must
first
pass
the
point
of
this
*NL*
lance
.
''
Then
he
brandished
it
with
such
vigor
and
dexterity
that
he
*NL*
struck
terror
into
all
those
who
did
not
know
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quiteria
's
disdain
made
such
an
impression
upon
Camacho
,
that
he
*NL*
instantly
banished
her
from
his
heart
.
The
persuasions
,
therefore
,
of
*NL*
the
priest
,
who
was
a
prudent
,
well-meaning
man
,
had
their
effect
;
*NL*
Camacho
and
his
party
sheathed
their
weapons
and
remained
satisfied
,
*NL*
blaming
rather
the
fickleness
of
Quiteria
than
the
cunning
of
Basilius
.
*NL*
With
much
reason
Camacho
thought
within
himself
that
if
Quiteria
loved
*NL*
Basilius
when
a
virgin
,
she
would
love
him
also
when
married
,
and
that
*NL*
he
had
more
cause
to
thank
Heaven
for
so
fortunate
an
escape
than
to
*NL*
repine
at
the
loss
he
had
sustained
.
The
disappointed
bridegroom
and
*NL*
his
followers
,
being
thus
consoled
and
appeased
,
those
of
Basilius
were
*NL*
so
likewise
;
and
the
rich
Camacho
,
to
show
that
his
mind
was
free
from
*NL*
resentment
,
would
have
the
diversions
and
entertainments
go
on
as
if
*NL*
they
had
been
really
married
.
The
happy
pair
,
however
,
not
choosing
to
*NL*
share
in
them
,
retired
to
their
own
dwelling
,
accompanied
by
their
*NL*
joyful
adherents
;
for
,
if
the
rich
man
can
draw
after
him
attendants
and
*NL*
flatterers
,
the
poor
man
who
is
virtuous
and
deserving
is
followed
by
*NL*
friends
who
honor
and
support
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
joined
the
party
of
Basilius
,
having
been
invited
by
them
as
*NL*
a
person
of
worth
and
bravery
;
while
Sancho
,
finding
it
impossible
to
*NL*
remain
and
share
the
relishing
delights
of
Camacho
's
festival
,
which
*NL*
continued
till
night
,
with
a
heavy
heart
accompanied
his
master
,
leaving
*NL*
behind
the
flesh-pots
of
Egypt
,
the
skimmings
of
which
,
though
now
*NL*
almost
consumed
,
still
reminded
him
of
the
glorious
abundance
he
had
*NL*
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
love
only
were
to
be
considered

''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
parents
would
*NL*
no

the

matching
their

Were

for
themselves
,
there
are
those
who
would
*NL*
prefer
their
father

serving-man
,
or
throw
themselves
away
on
some
*NL*
fellow
they
might
chance
to
see
in
the
street
,
mistaking
,
perhaps
,
an
*NL*
impostor
and
swaggering
poltroon
for
a
gentleman
,
since
passion
too
*NL*
easily
blinds
the
understanding
,
so
indispensably
necessary
in
deciding
*NL*
on
that
most
important
point
,
matrimony
,
which
is
peculiarly
exposed
to
*NL*
the
danger
of
a
mistake
,
and
therefore
needs
all
the
caution
that
human
*NL*
prudence
can
supply
,
aided
by
the
particular
favor
of
Heaven
.
A
person
*NL*
who
proposes
to
take
a
long
journey
,
if
he
is
prudent
,
before
he
sets
*NL*
forward
will
look
out
for
some
safe
and
agreeable
companion
;
and
should
*NL*
not
he
who
undertakes
a
journey
for
life
use
the
same
precaution
,
*NL*
especially
as
his
fellow-traveller
is
to
be
his
companion
at
bed
and
*NL*
board
and
in
all
other
situations
?
The
wife
is
not
a
commodity
which
,
*NL*
when
once
bought
,
you
can
exchange
or
return
;
the
marriage
bargain
,
once
*NL*
struck
,
is
irrevocable
.
It
is
a
noose
which

once
thrown
about

,
*NL*
turns
to
a
Gordian
knot

can
not

Take

it

advised

to
believe
she

fallen

be

I

he
may
find
a

in

I

would
exhort
him
to
pay
more
regard
to
reputation

to
fortune
;
for
a

virtuous

does
not
acquire
a

by
being
virtuous

she
must
likewise
maintain

If

bringest
a

it
will
be
an
easy
task
to
preserve

even
improve
her
virtue

*NL*

,
shouldst
thou
choose
a
wife
of
a
different
character
,
it
will
cost
*NL*
thee
abundance
of
pains
to
mend
her
;
for
it
is
not
very
practicable
to
*NL*
pass
from
one
extreme
to
another
;
I
do
not
say

THE
BRAYING
ALDERMEN
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
know
,
gentlemen
,
that
in
a
town
four
leagues
and
a
half
from
*NL*
this
place
,
a
certain
alderman
happened
to
lose
his
ass
,
all
through
the
*NL*
artful
contrivance
-LRB-
too
long
to
be
told
-RRB-
of
a
wench
his
maid-servant
;
*NL*
and
though
he
tried
every
means
to
recover
his
beast
,
it
was
to
no
*NL*
purpose
.
Fifteen
days
passed
,
as
public
fame
reports
,
after
the
ass
was
*NL*
missing
,
and
while
the
unlucky
alderman
was
standing
in
the
*NL*
market-place
,
another
alderman
of
the
same
town
came
up
to
him
,
and
*NL*
said
,
`
Pay
me
for
my
good
news
,
gossip
,
for
your
ass
has
made
its
*NL*
appearance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Most
willingly
,
neighbor
,
'
answered
the
other
;
`
but
tell
me
--
where
has
*NL*
he
been
seen
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
On
the
mountain
,
'
answered
the
other
;
'
I
saw
him
there
this
morning
,
*NL*
with
no
panel
or
furniture
upon
him
of
any
kind
,
and
so
lank
that
it
was
*NL*
grievous
to
behold
him
.
I
would
have
driven
him
before
me
and
brought
*NL*
him
to
you
,
but
he
is
already
become
so
shy
that
when
I
went
near
him
he
*NL*
took
to
his
heels
and
fled
to
a
distance
from
me
.
Now
,
if
you
like
it
we
*NL*
will
both
go
seek
him
;
but
first
let
me
put
up
this
of
mine
at
home
,
and
*NL*
I
will
return
instantly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You
will
do
me
a
great
favor
,
'
said
the
owner
of
the
lost
ass
,
`
and
I
*NL*
shall
be
happy
at
any
time
to
do
as
much
for
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
the
two
aldermen
,
hand
in
hand
and
side
by
side
,
trudged
*NL*
together
up
the
hill
;
and
on
coming
to
the
place
where
they
expected
to
*NL*
find
the
ass
,
they
found
him
not
,
nor
was
he
anywhere
to
be
seen
,
though
*NL*
they
made
diligent
search
.
Being
thus
disappointed
,
the
alderman
who
had
*NL*
seen
him
said
to
the
other
,
`
Hark
you
,
friend
,
I
have
thought
of
a
*NL*
stratagem
by
which
we
shall
certainly
discover
this
animal
,
even
though
*NL*
he
had
crept
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
,
instead
of
the
mountain
;
and
*NL*
it
is
this
:
I
can
bray
marvellously
well
,
and
if
you
can
do
a
little
in
*NL*
that
way
the
business
is
done
.

*NL*
*NL*
''

A
little

quoth
the
other
,
`
before
Heaven

braying

yield
to
none
--
no
,
not
to
asses
themselves
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
We
shall
soon
see
that
,
'
answered
the
second
alderman
;
`
go
you
on
one
*NL*
side
of
the
mountain
,
while
I
take
the
other
,
and
let
us
walk
round
it
,
*NL*
and
every
now
and
then
you
shall
bray
,
and
I
will
bray
;
and
the
ass
will
*NL*
certainly
hear
and
answer
us
,
if
he
still
remains
in
these
parts
.
'
*NL*
`
Verily
,
neighbor
,
your
device
is
excellent
,
and
worthy
your
good
*NL*
parts
,
'
said
the
owner
of
the
ass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
then
separated
,
according
to
agreement
,
and
both
began
braying
at
*NL*
the
same
instant
,
with
such
marvellous
truth
of
imitation
that
,
mutually
*NL*
deceived
,
each
ran
towards
the
other
,
not
doubting
but
that
the
ass
was
*NL*
found
;
and
,
on
meeting
,
the
loser
said
,
`
Is
it
possible

that
it
*NL*
was
not
my
ass
that
brayed

I
declare

the
owner

braying

there
is
not

difference

answered
the
author

the
stratagem

rather
to
you
than
to
me

for
by
Him
that
made
me

could
give
the
odds

your
tones

rich

your
notes

well
sustained

the

I
shall
value

more
henceforth

am
not

It

true

I

fancy
that
I
brayed
indifferently

I
tell

the
second
,
`
there
are
rare
abilities
often
lost
*NL*
to
the
world

they
are
ill-bestowed

not
how
to
*NL*
employ
them
to
advantage

'

*NL*
''
`
Right
,
brother
,
'
quoth
the
owner
,
`
though
,
except
in
cases
like
the
*NL*
present
,
ours
may
not
turn
to
much
account
;
and
even
in
this
business
,
*NL*
Heaven
grant
it
may
prove
of
service
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
said
,
they
separated
again
,
to
resume
their
braying
;
and
each
time
*NL*
were
deceived
as
before
,
and
met
again
,
till
they
at
length
agreed
,
as
a
*NL*
signal
,
to
distinguish
their
own
voices
from
that
of
the
ass
,
that
they
*NL*
should
bray
twice
together
,
one
immediately
after
the
other
.
Thus
,
*NL*
doubling
their
brayings
,
they
made
the
tour
of
the
whole
mountain
,
*NL*
without
having
any
answer
from
the
stray
ass
,
not
even
by
signs

How
,
*NL*
indeed
,
could
the
poor
creature
answer
,
whom
at
last
they
found
in
a
*NL*
thicket
,
half
devoured
by
wolves
?
On
seeing
the
body
,
the
owner
said
,
*NL*
`
Truly
,
I
wondered
at
his
silence
;
for
,
had
he
not
been
dead

he
*NL*
certainly
would
have
answered
us
,
or
he
were
no
true
ass
;
nevertheless
,
*NL*
neighbor
,
though
I
have
found
him
dead
,
my
trouble
in
the
search
has
*NL*
been
well
repaid
in
listening
to
your
exquisite
braying
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
is
in
good
hands

answered
the
other
;
`

if
the
abbot
*NL*
sings
well
,
the
novice
comes
not
far
behind
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hereupon
they
returned
home
hoarse
and
disconsolate
,
and
told
their
*NL*
friends
and
neighbors
all
that
had
happened
to
them
in
their
search
*NL*
after
the
ass
;
each
of
them
extolling
the
other
for
his
excellence
in
*NL*
braying
.
The
story
spread
all
over
the
adjacent
villages
,
and
the
devil
,
*NL*
who
sleeps
not
,
as
he
loves
to
sow
discord
wherever
he
can
,
raising
a
*NL*
bustle
in
the
wind
,
and
mischief
out
of
nothing
,
so
ordered
it
that
all
*NL*
the
neighboring
villagers
,
at
the
sight
of
any
of
our
towns-people
,
*NL*
would
immediately
begin
to
bray
,
as
it
were
hitting
us
in
the
teeth
with
*NL*
the
notable
talent
of
our
aldermen
.
The
boys
fell
to
it
,
which
was
the
*NL*
same
as
falling
into
the
hands
and
mouths
of
a
legion
of
devils
;
and
*NL*
thus
braying
spread
far
and
wide
,
insomuch
that
the
natives
of
the
town
*NL*
of
Bray
are
as
well
known
and
distinguished
as
the
negroes
are
from
*NL*
white
men
.
And
this
unhappy
jest
has
been
carried
so
far
that
our
people
*NL*
have
often
sallied
out
in
arms
against
their
scoffers
,
and
given
them
*NL*
battle
:
neither
king

rook
,
nor
fear
nor
shame
,
being
able
to
*NL*
restrain
them

Tomorrow

I
believe
,
or
next
day
,
those
of
our
town
will
*NL*
take
the
field
against
the
people
of
another
village
about
two
leagues
*NL*
from
us
,
being
one
of
those
which
persecute
us
most
:
and
I
have
brought
*NL*
the
lances
and
halberds
which
you
saw

that
we
may
be
well
prepared
for
*NL*
them

There
is
nothing
more
honorable

next
to
the
service
which
*NL*
you
owe
to

than
to
serve
your
king

natural
lord
,
*NL*
especially
in
the
profession
of
arms
,
which
,
if
less
*NL*
profitable
than
learning
,
far
exceeds
it
in
glory
.
More
*NL*
great
families

it
is
true
,
have
been
established
by
*NL*
learning
,
yet
there
is
in
the
martial
character
a
certain
*NL*
splendor
,
which
seems
to
exalt
it
far
above
all
other
*NL*
pursuits
.
But
allow
me
,
sir
,
to
offer
you
a
piece
of
advice
,
*NL*
which
,
believe
me
,
you
will
find
worth
your
attention
.
Never
*NL*
suffer
your
mind
to
dwell
on
the
adverse
events
of
your
*NL*
life
;
for
the
worst
that
can
befall
you
is
death
,
and
when
*NL*
attended
with
honor
there
is
no
event
so
glorious
.
Julius
*NL*
Caesar
,
that
valorous
Roman
,
being
asked
which
was
the
kind
*NL*
of
death
to
be
preferred
,
``
That
,
''
said
he
,
``
which
is
sudden
*NL*
and
unforeseen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
answered
like
a
heathen
,
who
knew
not
the
true
*NL*
God
,
yet
,
considering
human
infirmity
,
it
was
well
said
.
*NL*
For
,
supposing
you
should
be
cut
off
in
the
very
first
*NL*
encounter
,
either
by
cannon-shot
or
the
springing
of
a
mine
,
*NL*
what
does
it
signify
?
it
is
but
dying
,
which
is
inevitable
,
*NL*
and
,
being
over
,
there
it
ends
.
Terence
observes
that
the
*NL*
corpse
of
a
man
who
is
slain
in
battle
looks
better
than
the
*NL*
living
soldier
who
has
saved
himself
by
flight
;
and
the
good
*NL*
soldier
rises
in
estimation
according
to
the
measure
of
his
*NL*
obedience
to
those
who
command
him
.
Observe
,
moreover
,
my
*NL*
son
,
that
a
soldier
had
better
smell
of
gunpowder
than
of
*NL*
musk
;
and
if
old
age
overtakes
you
in
this
noble
profession
,
*NL*
though
lame
and
maimed
,
and
covered
with
wounds
,
it
will
*NL*
find
you
also
covered
with
honor
;
and
of
such
honor
as
*NL*
poverty
itself
can
not
deprive
you
.
From
poverty
,
indeed
,
you
*NL*
are
secure
;
for
care
is
now
taken
that
veteran
and
disabled
*NL*
soldiers
shall
not
be
exposed
to
want
,
nor
be
treated
as
*NL*
many
do
their
negro
slaves
,
when
old
and
past
service
,
*NL*
turning
them
out
of
their
houses
,
and
,
under
pretence
of
*NL*
giving
them
freedom
,
leave
them
slaves
to
hunger
,
from
which
*NL*
they
can
have
no
relief
but
in
death
.

The

not

termed

the

rather

I
have

Wit

*NL*
Every

*NL*
*NL*
Modesty
is
as
becoming

*NL*
*NL*
The

is
respected
in

*NL*
*NL*
Who
sets
up
for

at

*NL*
*NL*
The
weapons
of
gownsmen

Keep

you

*NL*
Well
sheltered

he

*NL*

An
affront
must
come
from
a
person
who
not
only
gives
it
,
*NL*
but
who
can
maintain
it
when
it
is
given
;
an
injury
may
come
*NL*
from
any

*NL*
*NL*
He
who

*NL*
He
who
lives
long
;
must
suffer
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
deprive
a
knight-errant
of
his
mistress
is
to
rob
him
of
*NL*
the
eyes
with
which
he
sees
,
the
sun
by
which
he
is
*NL*
enlightened
,
and
the
support
by
which
he
is
maintained
.
I
*NL*
have
many
times
said
,
and
now
I
repeat
the
observation
,
that
*NL*
a
knight-errant
without
a
mistress
is
like
a
tree
without
*NL*
leaves
,
a
building
without
cement
,
and
a
shadow
without
the
*NL*
substance
by
which
it
is
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Possessing
beauty
without
blemish
,
dignity
without
pride
,
*NL*
love
with
modesty
,
politeness
springing
from
courtesy
,
and
*NL*
courtesy
from
good
breeding
,
and
,
finally
,
of
illustrious
*NL*
descent
:
for
the
beauty
that
is
of
a
noble
race
shines
with
*NL*
more
splendor
than
that
which
is
meanly
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
Virtue
ennobles
blood
,
and
a
virtuous
person
of
humble
birth
*NL*
is
more
estimable
than
a
vicious
person
of
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
inform
your
graces
that
Sancho
Panza
is
one
of
the
*NL*
most
pleasant
squires
that
ever
served
a
knight-errant
.
*NL*
Sometimes
his
simplicity
is
so
arch
,
that
to
consider
*NL*
whether
he
is
more
fool
or
wag
yields
abundance
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
He
has
roguery
enough
to
pass
for
a
knave
,
and
absurdities
*NL*
sufficient
to
confirm
him
a
fool
.
He
doubts
everything
and
*NL*
believes
everything
;
and
often
,
when
I
think
he
is
going
to
*NL*
discharge
nonsense
,
he
will
utter
apothegms
that
will
raise
*NL*
him
to
the
skies
.
In
a
word
,
I
would
not
exchange
him
for
*NL*
any
other
squire
,
even
with
a
city
to
boot
;
and
therefore
I
*NL*
am
in
doubt
whether
or
not
it
will
be
expedient
to
send
him
*NL*
to
that
government
which
your
grace
has
been
so
good
as
to
*NL*
bestow
upon
him
,
although
I
can
perceive
in
him
a
certain
*NL*
aptitude
for
such
an
office
;
so
that
,
when
his
understanding
*NL*
is
a
very
little
polished
,
he
will
agree
with
any
*NL*
government
,
like
the
king
with
his
customs
;
for
we
know
by
*NL*
repeated
experience
that
great
talents
and
learning
are
not
*NL*
necessary
in
a
governor
,
as
there
are
a
hundred
at
least
who
*NL*
govern
like
gerfalcons
,
though
they
can
hardly
read
their
*NL*
mother
tongue
.
Provided
their
intention
is
righteous
and
*NL*
their
desire
to
do
justice
,
they
will
never
want
counsellors
*NL*
to
direct
them
in
every
transaction
,
like
your
military
*NL*
governors
,
who
being
illiterate
themselves
,
never
decide
*NL*
without
the
advice
of
an
assessor
.
I
shall
advise
him
*NL*
corruption
to
eschew
,
but
never
quit
his
due
,
and
inculcate
*NL*
some
other
small
matters
that
are
in
my
head
,
which
,
in
*NL*
process
of
time
,
may
redound
to
his
own
interest
as
well
as
*NL*
to
the
advantage
of
the
island
under
his
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
customs
of

agreeable

SANCHO
'S
PLIGHT
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Duke
and
Duchess
were
extremely
diverted
with
the
humors
of
their
*NL*
two
guests
;
and
resolving
to
improve
their
sport
by
practising
some
*NL*
pleasantries
that
should
have
the
appearance
of
a
romantic
adventure
,
*NL*
they
contrived
to
dress
up
a
very
choice
entertainment
from
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
account
of
the
Cave
of
Montesinos
,
taking
that
subject
*NL*
because
the
Duchess
had
observed
with
astonishment
that
Sancho
now
*NL*
believed
his
lady
Dulcinea
was
really
enchanted
,
although
he
himself
had
*NL*
been
her
sole
enchanter
!
Accordingly
,
after
the
servants
had
been
well
*NL*
instructed
as
to
their
deportment
towards
Don
Quixote
,
a
boar-hunt
was
*NL*
proposed
,
and
it
was
determined
to
set
out
in
five
or
six
days
with
a
*NL*
princely
train
of
huntsmen
.
The
knight
was
presented
with
a
hunting
suit
*NL*
proper
for
the
occasion
,
which
,
however
,
he
declined
,
saying
that
he
*NL*
must
soon
return
to
the
severe
duties
of
his
profession
,
when
,
having
no
*NL*
sumpters
nor
wardrobes
,
such
things
would
be
superfluous
.
But
Sancho
*NL*
readily
accepted
a
suit
of
fine
green
cloth
which
was
offered
to
him
,
*NL*
intending
to
sell
it
the
first
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appointed
day
being
come
,
Don
Quixote
armed
himself
,
and
Sancho
in
*NL*
his
new
suit
mounted
Dapple
-LRB-
which
he
preferred
to
a
horse
that
was
*NL*
offered
him
-RRB-
and
joined
the
troop
of
hunters
.
The
Duchess
issued
forth
*NL*
magnificently
attired
,
and
Don
Quixote
,
out
of
pure
politeness
,
would
*NL*
hold
the
reins
of
the
palfrey
,
though
the
Duke
was
unwilling
to
allow
*NL*
it
.
Having
arrived
at
the
proposed
scene
of
their
diversion
,
which
was
*NL*
in
a
wood
between
two
lofty
mountains
,
they
posted
themselves
in
places
*NL*
where
the
toils
were
to
be
pitched
;
and
all
the
party
having
taken
their
*NL*
different
stations
,
the
sport
began
with
prodigious
noise
and
clamor
,
*NL*
insomuch
that
between
the
shouts
of
the
huntsmen
,
the
cry
of
the
hounds
,
*NL*
and
the
sound
of
the
horns
,
they
could
not
hear
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Duchess
alighted
,
and
with
a
boar-spear
in
her
hand
,
took
her
stand
*NL*
in
a
place
where
she
expected
the
boars
would
pass
.
The
Duke
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
dismounted
also
,
and
placed
themselves
by
her
side
;
while
Sancho
*NL*
took
his
station
behind
them
all
,
with
his
Dapple
,
whom
he
would
not
*NL*
quit
,
lest
some
mischance
should
befall
him
.
Scarcely
had
they
ranged
*NL*
themselves
in
order
when
a
hideous
boar
of
monstrous
size
rushed
out
of
*NL*
cover
,
pursued
by
the
dogs
and
hunters
,
and
made
directly
towards
them
,
*NL*
gnashing
his
teeth
and
tossing
foam
with
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
on
seeing
him
approach
,
braced
his
shield
,
and
drawing
his
*NL*
sword
,
stepped
before
the
rest
to
meet
him
.
The
Duke
joined
him
with
his
*NL*
boar-spear
,
and
the
Duchess
would
have
been
the
foremost
had
not
the
*NL*
Duke
prevented
her
.
Sancho
alone
stood
aghast
,
and
at
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
fierce
animal
,
leaving
even
his
Dapple
,
ran
in
terror
towards
a
lofty
*NL*
oak
,
in
which
he
hoped
to
be
secure
;
but
his
hopes
were
in
vain
,
for
,
as
*NL*
he
was
struggling
to
reach
the
top
,
and
had
got
half-way
up
,
*NL*
unfortunately
a
branch
to
which
he
clung
,
gave
way
,
and
falling
with
it
,
*NL*
he
was
caught
by
the
stump
of
another
,
and
here
left
suspended
in
the
*NL*
air
,
so
that
he
could
neither
get
up
nor
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
himself
in
this
situation
,
with
his
new
green
coat
tearing
,
and
*NL*
almost
in
reach
of
the
terrible
creature
should
it
chance
to
come
that
*NL*
way
,
he
began
to
bawl
so
loud
and
to
call
for
help
so
vehemently
,
that
*NL*
all
who
heard
him
and
did
not
see
him
thought
verily
he
was
between
the
*NL*
teeth
of
some
wild
beast
.
The
tusked
boar
,
however
,
was
soon
laid
at
*NL*
length
by
the
numerous
spears
that
were
levelled
at
him
from
all
sides
,
*NL*
at
which
time
Sancho
's
cries
and
lamentations
reached
the
ears
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
,
turning
round
,
beheld
him
hanging
from
the
oak
with
his
*NL*
head
downwards
,
and
close
by
him
stood
Dapple
,
who
never
forsook
him
in
*NL*
adversity
,
--
indeed
,
it
was
remarked
by
Cid
Hamet
,
that
he
seldom
saw
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
without
Dapple
,
or
Dapple
without
Sancho
Panza
,
such
was
*NL*
the
amity
and
cordial
love
that
subsisted
between
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
his
squire
,
who
was
no
sooner
*NL*
released
than
he
began
to
examine
the
rent
in
his
hunting
suit
,
which
*NL*
grieved
him
to
the
soul
,
for
he
looked
upon
that
suit
as
a
rich
*NL*
inheritance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
huge
animal
they
had
slain
was
laid
across
a
sumpter-mule
,
and
after
*NL*
covering
it
with
branches
of
rosemary
and
myrtle
,
they
carried
it
,
as
*NL*
the
spoils
of
victory
,
to
a
large
field-tent
,
erected
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
the
wood
,
where
a
sumptuous
entertainment
was
prepared
,
worthy
of
the
*NL*
magnificence
of
the
donor
.
Sancho
,
showing
the
wounds
of
the
torn
*NL*
garments
to
the
Duchess
,
said
:
``
Had
hares
or
birds
been
our
game
,
I
*NL*
should
not
have
had
this
misfortune
.
For
my
part
I
can
not
think
what
*NL*
pleasure
there
can
be
in
beating
about
for
a
monster
that
,
if
it
reaches
*NL*
you
with
a
tusk
,
may
be
the
death
of
you
.
There
is
an
old
ballad
which
*NL*
says
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
May
fate
of
Fabila
be
thine
,
*NL*
And
make
thee
food
for
bears
or
swine
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Fabila
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
was
a
king
of
the
Goths
,
who
,
going
to
*NL*
the
chase
,
was
devoured
by
a
bear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
mean
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
is
,
that
I
would
not
have
kings
and
other
*NL*
great
folks
run
into
such
dangers
merely
for
pleasure
;
and
,
indeed
,
*NL*
methinks
it
ought
to
be
none
to
kill
poor
beasts
that
never
meant
any
*NL*
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duke
,
``
hunting
wild
beasts
is
the
*NL*
most
proper
exercise
for
knights
and
princes
.
The
chase
is
an
image
of
*NL*
war
:
there
you
have
stratagems
,
artifices
,
and
ambuscades
to
be
*NL*
employed
,
in
order
to
overcome
your
enemy
with
safety
to
yourself
.
*NL*
There
,
too
,
you
are
often
exposed
to
the
extremes
of
cold
and
heat
;
*NL*
idleness
and
ease
are
despised
;
the
body
acquires
health
and
vigorous
*NL*
activity
:
in
short
,
it
is
an
exercise
which
may
be
beneficial
to
many
*NL*
and
injurious
to
none
.
Besides
,
it
is
not
a
vulgar
amusement
,
but
,
like
*NL*
hawking
,
is
the
peculiar
sport
of
the
great
.
Therefore
,
Sancho
,
change
*NL*
your
opinion
before
you
become
a
governor
,
for
then
you
will
find
your
*NL*
account
in
these
diversions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
i
'
faith
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
the
good
governor
and
the
broken
*NL*
leg
should
keep
at
home
.
It
would
be
fine
,
indeed
,
for
people
to
come
*NL*
after
him
about
business
and
find
him
gadding
in
the
mountains
for
his
*NL*
pleasure
.
At
that
rate
what
would
become
of
his
government
?
In
good
*NL*
truth
,
sir
,
hunting
and
such
like
pastimes
are
rather
for
your
idle
*NL*
companions
than
for
governors
.
The
way
I
mean
to
divert
myself
shall
be
*NL*
with
brag
at
Easter
and
at
bowls
on
Sundays
and
holidays
;
as
for
your
*NL*
hunting
,
it
befits
neither
my
condition
nor
conscience

*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
grant
you
prove
as
good
as
you

said
the
duke

``

often
wide
apart

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
that

replied
Sancho

``
the
good

wants
no

God

THE
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
METHOD
PRESCRIBED
TO
DON
QUIXOTE
FOR
DISENCHANTING
*NL*
DULCINEA
;
WITH
OTHER
WONDERFUL
EVENTS
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
agreeable
music
approached
,
they
observed
that
it
attended
a
*NL*
stately
triumphal
car
,
drawn
by
six
gray
mules
covered
with
white
linen
,
*NL*
and
upon
each
of
them
rode
a
penitent
of
light
,
clothed
also
in
white
,
*NL*
and
holding
a
lighted
torch
in
his
hand
.
The
car
was
more
than
double
*NL*
the
size
of
the
others
which
had
passed
,
and
twelve
penitents
were
*NL*
ranged
in
order
within
it
,
all
carrying
lighted
torches
,
--
a
sight
which
*NL*
at
once
caused
surprise
and
terror
.
Upon
an
elevated
throne
sat
a
nymph
,
*NL*
covered
with
a
thousand
veils
of
silver
tissue
,
bespangled
with
*NL*
innumerable
flowers
of
gold
,
so
that
her
dress
,
if
not
rich
,
was
gay
and
*NL*
glittering
.
Over
her
head
was
thrown
a
transparent
gauze
,
so
thin
that
*NL*
through
its
folds
might
be
seen
a
most
beautiful
face
;
and
from
the
*NL*
multitude
of
lights
,
it
was
easy
to
discern
that
she
was
young
as
well
*NL*
as
beautiful
,
for
she
was
evidently
under
twenty
years
of
age
,
though
*NL*
not
less
than
seventeen
.
Close
by
her
sat
a
figure
,
clad
in
a
*NL*
magnificent
robe
reaching
to
the
feet
,
having
his
head
covered
with
a
*NL*
black
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
this
vast
machine
arrived
opposite
to
where
the
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
and
Don
Quixote
stood
,
the
attending
music
ceased
,
as
well
as
*NL*
the
harps
and
lutes
within
the
car
.
The
figure
in
the
gown
then
stood
*NL*
up
,
and
throwing
open
the
robe
and
uncovering
his
face
;
displayed
the
*NL*
ghastly
countenance
of
death
,
looking
so
terrific
that
Don
Quixote
*NL*
started
,
Sancho
was
struck
with
terror
,
and
even
the
duke
and
duchess
*NL*
seemed
to
betray
some
symptoms
of
fear
.
This
living
Death
,
standing
*NL*
erect
,
in
a
dull
and
drowsy
tone
and
with
a
sleepy
articulation
,
spoke
*NL*
as
follows
:

``

*NL*
``
It
must
not
be
so

said
Merlin
;
``
the
lashes
that
honest
Sancho
is
to

receive

not

force

with
his

,
and
at

whatever

for
no

is
fixed
;
and
furthermore

he

allowed

if
he
please

to
save
himself
half
the
trouble

applying
so
*NL*
many
lashes

by
having
half
the
number
laid
on

*NL*
``

Sancho
,
``

No
sooner
had
Sancho
thus
declared
himself
than
the
spangled
nymph
who
*NL*
sat
by
the
side
of
Merlin
arose
,
and
throwing
aside
her
veil
,
discovered
*NL*
a
face
of
extraordinary
beauty
;
and
with
a
masculine
air
and
no
very
*NL*
amiable
voice
,
addressed
herself
to
Sancho
:

lashes
,
which
there
is
not
a
*NL*
wretched
school-boy
but
receives
every
month
,
it
amazes
,
stupefies
,
and
*NL*
affrights
the
tender
bowels
of
all
who
hear
it
,
and
even
of
all
who
*NL*
shall
hereafter
be
told
it
.
Cast
,
thou
marble-hearted
wretch
!
--
cast
,
I
*NL*
say
,
those
huge
goggle
eyes
upon
these
lovely
balls
of
mine
,
that
shine
*NL*
like
glittering
stars
,
and
thou
wilt
see
them
weep
,
drop
by
drop
,
and
*NL*
stream
after
stream
,
making
furrows
,
tracks
,
and
paths
down
these
*NL*
beautiful
cheeks
!
Relent
,
malicious
and
evil-minded
monster
!
Be
moved
by
*NL*
my
blooming
youth
,
which
,
though
yet
in
its
teens
,
is
pining
and
*NL*
withering
beneath
the
vile
bark
of
a
peasant
wench
;
and
if
at
this
*NL*
moment
I
appear
otherwise
,
it
is
by
the
special
favor
of
Signor
Merlin
,
*NL*
here
present
,
hoping
that
these
charms
may
soften
that
iron
heart
,
for
*NL*
the
tears
of
afflicted
beauty
turn
rocks
into
cotton
and
tigers
into
*NL*
lambs
.
Lash
,
untamed
beast
!
lash
away
on
that
brawny
flesh
of
thine
,
and
*NL*
rouse
from
that
base
sloth
which
only
inclines
thee
to
eat
and
eat
*NL*
again
,
and
restore
to
me
the
delicacy
of
my
skin
,
the
sweetness
of
my
*NL*
temper
,
and
all
the
charms
of
beauty
.
And
if
for
my
sake
thou
wilt
not
*NL*
be
mollified
into
reasonable
compliance
,
let
the
anguish
of
that
*NL*
miserable
knight
stir
thee
to
compassion
,
--
thy
master
,
I
mean
,
whose
*NL*
soul
I
see
sticking
crosswise
in
his
throat
,
not
ten
inches
from
his
*NL*
lips
,
waiting
only
thy
cruel
or
kind
answer
either
to
fly
out
of
his
*NL*
mouth
or
to
return
joyfully
into
his
bosom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
here
putting
his
finger
to
his
throat
,
``
Before
Heaven
!
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
Dulcinea
is
right
,
for
I
here
feel
my
soul
sticking
in
my
*NL*
throat
like
the
stopper
of
a
crossbow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say
you
to
that
,
Sancho
?
''
quoth
the
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
madam
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
what
I
have
already
said
,
that
as
to
*NL*
the
lashes
,
I
pronounce
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Renounce
_
,
you
should
say
,
Sancho
,
''
quoth
the
duke
,
``
and
not
*NL*
pronounce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
your
grandeur
to
let
me
alone
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
for
I
can
not
*NL*
stand
now
to
a
letter
more
or
less
.
These
lashes
so
torment
me
that
I
*NL*
know
not
what
I
say
or
do
.
But
I
would
fain
know
one
thing
from
the
Lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
and
that
is
,
where
she
learnt
her
manner
of
asking
*NL*
a
favor
?
She
comes
to
desire
me
to
tear
my
flesh
with
stripes
,
and
at
*NL*
the
same
time
lays
upon
me
such
a
bead-roll
of
ill
names
that
the
devil
*NL*
may
bear
them
for
me
.
What
!
does
she
think
my
flesh
is
made
of
brass
?
or
*NL*
that
I
care
a
rush
whether
she
is
enchanted
or
not
?
Where
are
the
*NL*
presents
she
has
brought
to
soften
me
?
Instead
of
a
basket
of
fine
linen
*NL*
shirts
,
night-caps
,
and
socks
-LRB-
though
I
wear
none
-RRB-
,
here
is
nothing
but
*NL*
abuse
.
Every
one
knows
that
`
the
golden
load
is
a
burden
light
;
'
that
*NL*
`
gifts
will
make
their
way
through
stone
walls
;
'
`
pray
devoutly
and
*NL*
hammer
on
stoutly
;
'
and
`
one
take
is
worth
two
I
'll
give
thee
's
.
'
*NL*
There
's
his
worship
my
master
,
too
,
instead
of
wheedling
and
coaxing
me
*NL*
to
make
myself
wool
and
carded
cotton
,
threatens
to
tie
me
naked
to
a
*NL*
tree
and
double
the
dose
of
stripes
.
These
tender-hearted
gentlefolks
*NL*
ought
to
remember
,
too
,
that
they
not
only
desire
to
have
a
squire
*NL*
whipped
,
but
a
governor
,
making
no
more
of
it
than
saying
,
`
Drink
with
*NL*
your
cherries
.
'
Let
them
learn
,
--
plague
take
them
!
--
let
them
learn
how
*NL*
to
ask
and
entreat
,
and
mind
their
breeding
.
All
times
are
not
alike
,
*NL*
nor
are
men
always
in
a
humor
for
all
things
.
At
this
moment
my
heart
is
*NL*
ready
to
burst
with
grief
to
see
this
rent
in
my
jacket
,
and
people
come
*NL*
to
desire
that
I
would
also
tear
my
flesh
,
and
that
,
too
,
of
my
own
good
*NL*
will
.
I
have
just
as
much
mind
to
the
thing
as
to
turn
Turk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
,
friend
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duke
,
``
if
you
do
not
relent
and
*NL*
become
softer
than
a
ripe
fig
,
you
finger
no
government

It
were
good
*NL*
indeed
,
that
I
should
send
my
islanders
a
cruel
flinty-hearted
governor
;
*NL*
one
who
relents
not
at
the
tears
of
afflicted
damsels
,
nor
at
the
*NL*
entreaties
of
wise
,
awful
,
and
ancient
enchanters
,
and
sages
.
In
fine

Sancho

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

answered
Sancho

``
may
I
not
be
allowed
two
days
to
consider
*NL*
what
is
best
for
me
to
do
?

*NL*
``
No

quoth
Merlin
;

upon

to
her
former
condition

wench

else
in

form
be
carried
to
the
Elysian
fields

be
fulfilled

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

honest
Sancho

quoth
the
duchess

``
be

gratitude

whom
*NL*
we
are
all
bound

*NL*
``
Hark

quoth
Sancho

addressing
himself
to
the
sage
;
*NL*
``

will
you
tell
me
one
thing

how
comes
it
about
that
the
*NL*
devil-courier
just
now
brought
a
message
to
my
master
from
Signor
*NL*
Montesinos
,
saying
that
he
would
be
here
anon
,
to
give
directions
about
*NL*
this
disenchantment
;
and
yet
we
have
seen
nothing
of
them
all
this
*NL*
while
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pshaw
!
''
replied
Merlin
,
``
the
devil
is
an
ass
and
a
lying
rascal
;
he
was
*NL*
sent
from
me
and
not
from
Montesinos
,
who
is
still
in
his
cave
*NL*
contriving
,
or
rather
awaiting
,
the
end
of
his
enchantment
,
for
the
tail
*NL*
is
yet
unflayed
.
If
he
owes
you
money
,
or
you
have
any
other
business
*NL*
with
him
,
he
shall
be
forthcoming
in
a
trice
,
when
and
where
you
think
*NL*
fit
;
and
therefore
come
to
a
decision
,
and
consent
to
this
small
*NL*
penance
,
from
which
both
your
soul
and
body
will
receive
marvellous
*NL*
benefit
;
your
soul
by
an
act
of
charity
,
and
your
body
by
a
wholesome
*NL*
and
timely
bloodletting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
the
world
swarms
with
doctors
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
the
very
enchanters
*NL*
seem
to
be
of
a
trade
!
Well
,
since
everybody
tells
me
so
,
though
the
*NL*
thing
is
out
of
all
reason
,
I
promise
to
give
myself
the
three
thousand
*NL*
three
hundred
lashes
,
upon
condition
that
I
may
lay
them
on
whenever
I
*NL*
please
,
without
being
tied
to
days
or
times
;
and
I
will
endeavor
to
get
*NL*
out
of
debt
as
soon
as
I
possibly
can
,
that
the
beauty
of
my
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
may
shine
forth
to
all
the
world
;
as
it
seems
she
is
*NL*
really
beautiful
,
which
I
much
doubted
.
Another
condition
is
,
that
I
*NL*
will
not
be
bound
to
draw
blood
,
and
if
some
lashes
happen
only
to
*NL*
fly-flap
,
they
shall
all
go
into
the
account
.
Moreover
if
I
should
*NL*
mistake
in
the
reckoning
,
Signor
Merlin
here
,
who
knows
everything
,
*NL*
shall
give
me
notice
how
many
I
want
or
have
exceeded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
exceedings
,
there
is
no
need
of
keeping
account
of
them
,
''
*NL*
answered
Merlin
;
``
for
when
the
number
is
completed
,
that
instant
will
*NL*
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
be
disenchanted
,
and
come
full
of
gratitude
*NL*
in
search
of
good
Sancho
,
to
thank
and
even
reward
him
for
the
generous
*NL*
deed
.
So
that
no
scruples
are
necessary
about
surplus
and
deficiency
;
*NL*
and
Heaven
forbid
that
I
should
allow
anybody
to
be
cheated
of
a
single
*NL*
hair
of
their
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
,
then
,
in
God
's
name
,
''
quoth
Sancho
;
``
I
must
submit
to
my
ill
*NL*
fortune
:
I
say
I
consent
to
the
penance
upon
the
conditions
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
Sancho
pronounced
his
consent
than
the
innumerable
*NL*
instruments
poured
forth
their
music
,
the
volleys
of
musketry
were
*NL*
discharged
,
while
Don
Quixote
clung
about
Sancho
's
neck
,
giving
him
,
on
*NL*
his
forehead
and
brawny
cheeks
,
a
thousand
kisses
;
the
duke
and
duchess
,
*NL*
and
all
who
were
present
,
likewise
testified
their
satisfaction
.
The
car
*NL*
now
moved
on
,
and
in
departing
the
fair
Dulcinea
bowed
her
head
to
the
*NL*
duke
and
duchess
,
and
made
a
low
curtesy
to
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
cheerful
and
joyous
dawn
began
to
appear
,
the
flowerets
*NL*
of
the
fields
expanded
their
fragrant
beauties
to
the
light
;
and
brooks
*NL*
and
streams
,
in
gentle
murmurs
,
ran
to
pay
expecting
rivers
in
their
*NL*
crystal
tribute
.
The
earth
rejoiced
,
the
sky
was
clear
,
and
the
air
*NL*
serene
and
calm
;
all
,
combined
and
separately
,
giving
manifest
tokens
*NL*
that
the
day
,
which
followed
fast
upon
Aurora
's
heels
,
would
be
bright
*NL*
and
fair

The
duke
and
duchess
,
having
happily
executed
their
ingenious
*NL*
project
,
returned
highly
gratified
to
their
castle
,
and
determined
on
*NL*
the
continuation
of
fictions
which
afforded
more
pleasures
than

SANCHO
PANZA
'S
LETTER
TO
HIS
WIFE
TERESA
PANZA
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
have
been
finely
lashed
,
I
have
been
finely
mounted
up
:
if
I
have
*NL*
got
a
good
government
,
it
has
cost
me
many
good
lashes
.
This
,
my
dear
*NL*
Teresa
,
thou
canst
not
understand
at
present
;
another
time
thou
wilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thou
must
know
,
Teresa
,
that
I
am
determined
that
thou
shalt
ride
in
thy
*NL*
coach
,
which
is
somewhat
to
the
purpose
,
for
all
other
ways
of
going
are
*NL*
no
better
than
creeping
upon
all
fours
,
like
a
cat
.
Thou
shalt
be
a
*NL*
governor
's
wife
;
see
then
whether
anybody
will
dare
to
tread
on
thy
*NL*
heels
.
I
here
send
thee
a
green
hunting-suit
which
my
lady
duchess
gave
*NL*
me
;
fit
it
up
so
that
it
may
serve
our
daughter
for
a
jacket
and
*NL*
petticoat
.
They
say
in
this
country
that
my
master
Don
Quixote
is
a
*NL*
sensible
madman
and
a
pleasant
fool
,
and
that
I
am
not
a
whit
behind
*NL*
him
.
We
have
been
in
Montesino
's
cave
,
and
the
sage
Merlin
,
the
wizard
,
*NL*
has
pitched
upon
me
to
disenchant
the
Lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
who
*NL*
among
you
is
called
Aldonza
Lorenzo
.
When
I
have
given
myself
three
*NL*
thousand
and
three
hundred
lashes
,
lacking
five
,
she
will
be
as
free
*NL*
from
enchantment
as
the
mother
that
bore
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Say
nothing
of
this
to
anybody
;
for
,
bring
your
affairs
into
council
,
*NL*
and
one
will
cry
it
is
white
,
another
it
is
black
.
A
few
days
hence
I
*NL*
shall
go
to
the
government
,
whither
I
go
with
a
huge
desire
to
get
*NL*
money
;
and
I
am
told
it
is
the
same
with
all
new
governors
.
I
will
first
*NL*
see
how
matters
stand
,
and
send
thee
word
whether
or
not
thou
shalt
come
*NL*
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dapple
is
well
,
and
sends
thee
his
hearty
service
;
part
with
him
I
will
*NL*
not
,
though
I
were
made
the
great
Turk
.
The
duchess
,
my
mistress
,
kisses
*NL*
thy
hands
a
thousand
times
over
.
Return
her
two
thousand
;
for
,
as
my
*NL*
master
says
,
nothing
is
cheaper
than
civil
words
.
God
has
not
been
*NL*
pleased
to
throw
in
my
way
another
portmanteau
and
another
hundred
*NL*
crowns
,
as
once
before
;
but
take
no
heed
,
my
dear
Teresa
,
for
he
that
*NL*
has
the
game
in
his
hand
need
not
mind
the
loss
of
a
trick
,
--
the
*NL*
government
will
make
up
for
all
.
One
thing
only
troubles
me
:
I
am
told
*NL*
if
I
once
try
it
I
shall
eat
my
very
fingers
after
it
;
and
if
so
,
it
*NL*
will
not
be
much
of
a
bargain
,
though
,
indeed
,
the
crippled
and
maimed
*NL*
enjoy
a
petty
canonry
in
the
alms
they
receive
;
so
that
,
one
way
or
*NL*
another
,
thou
art
sure
to
be
rich
and
happy
.
God
send
it
may
be
so
,
as
*NL*
He
easily
can
,
and
keep
me
for
thy
sake
.

THE
KNIGHT
REPROVED
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
thousand
courtly
compliments
mutually
interchanged
,
Don
Quixote
*NL*
advanced
towards
the
table
,
between
the
duke
and
duchess
,
and
,
on
*NL*
preparing
to
seat
themselves
,
they
offered
the
upper
end
to
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
who
would
have
declined
it
but
for
the
pressing
importunities
of
the
*NL*
duke
.
The
ecclesiastic
seated
himself
opposite
to
the
knight
,
and
the
*NL*
duke
and
duchess
on
each
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
present
all
the
while
,
in
amazement
to
see
the
honor
paid
by
*NL*
those
great
people
to
his
master
;
and
,
whilst
the
numerous
entreaties
*NL*
and
ceremonies
were
passing
between
the
duke
and
Don
Quixote
,
before
he
*NL*
would
sit
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
he
said
:
``
With
your
honor
's
*NL*
leave
I
will
tell
you
a
story
of
what
happened
in
our
town
about
seats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
immediately
began
to
tremble
,
not
doubting
that
he
was
going
*NL*
to
say
something
absurd
.
Sancho
observed
him
,
and
,
understanding
his
*NL*
looks
,
he
said
:
``
Be
not
afraid
,
sir
,
of
my
breaking
loose
or
saying
*NL*
anything
that
is
not
pat
to
the
purpose
.
I
have
not
forgotten
the
advice
*NL*
your
worship
gave
me
awhile
ago
about
talking
much
or
little
,
well
or
*NL*
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
nothing
,
Sancho
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
``
say
what
thou
wilt
,
*NL*
so
as
thou
sayst
it
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
would
say
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
is
very
true
,
for
my
master
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
is
present
,
will
not
suffer
me
to
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lie
as
much
as
thou
wilt
for
me
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
shall
*NL*
not
hinder
thee
;
but
take
heed
what
thou
art
going
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heeded
it
over
and
over
again
,
so
that
it
is
as
safe
as
if
I
had
*NL*
the
game
in
my
hand
,
as
you
shall
presently
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
graces
will
do
well
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
to
order
this
blockhead
*NL*
to
retire
,
that
you
may
get
rid
of
his
troublesome
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
life
of
the
duke
,
''
quoth
the
duchess
,
``
Sancho
shall
not
stir
a
*NL*
jot
from
me
.
I
have
a
great
regard
for
him
,
and
am
assured
of
his
*NL*
discretion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
happy
years
may
your
holiness
live
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
for
the
good
*NL*
opinion
you
have
of
me
,
little
as
I
deserve
it
.
But
the
tale
I
would
*NL*
tell
is
this
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
certain
gentleman
of
our
town
,
very
rich
and
of
a
good
family
,
--
for
*NL*
he
was
descended
from
the
Alamos
of
Medina
del
Campo
,
and
married
Donna
*NL*
Mencia
de
Quinnones
,
who
was
daughter
to
Don
Alonzo
de
Maranon
,
knight
*NL*
of
the
order
of
St.
James
,
the
same
that
was
drowned
in
the
Herradura
,
*NL*
about
whom
that
quarrel
happened
in
our
town
,
in
which
it
was
said
my
*NL*
master
Don
Quixote
had
a
hand
,
and
Tommy
the
mad-cap
,
son
of
Balvastro
*NL*
the
blacksmith
,
was
hurt
.
Pray
,
good
master
of
mine
,
is
not
all
this
*NL*
true
?
Speak
,
I
beseech
you
,
that
their
worships
may
not
take
me
for
some
*NL*
lying
prater
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
yet
,
''
said
the
ecclesiastic
,
``
I
take
you
rather
for
a
prater
than
*NL*
for
a
liar
;
but
I
know
not
what
I
shall
next
take
you
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
produced
so
many
witnesses
and
so
many
proofs
,
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
that
I
can
not
but
say
thou
mayst
probably
be
speaking
truth
;
*NL*
but
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
shorten
thy
story
,
or
it
will
last
these
two
*NL*
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shall
shorten
nothing
,
''
quoth
the
duchess
;
``
and
to
please
me
,
he
*NL*
shall
tell
it
his
own
way
,
although
he
were
not
to
finish
these
six
*NL*
days
;
and
,
should
it
last
so
long
,
they
would
be
to
me
days
of
delight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
tell
you
,
then
,
''
proceeded
Sancho
,
``
that
this
same
*NL*
gentleman
--
whom
I
know
as
well
as
I
do
my
right
hand
from
my
left
,
for
*NL*
it
is
not
a
bow-shot
from
my
house
to
his
--
invited
a
husbandman
to
dine
*NL*
with
him
,
--
a
poor
man
,
but
mainly
honest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On

''
said
the
chaplain
,
``
for

at
the
rate

proceed

your

tale
will
not
reach
its
end
till
you
reach
the
other
world

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
stop
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
before
I
get
half-way
thither
,
if
it
*NL*
please
Heaven
!
This
same
farmer
coming
to
the
house
of
the
gentleman
his
*NL*
inviter
--
God
rest
his
soul
,
for
he
is
dead
and
gone
;
and
,
moreover
,
died
*NL*
like
an
angel
,
as
it
is
said
,
--
for
I
was
not
by
myself

being
at
that
*NL*
time
gone
a
reaping
to
Tembleque
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prithee

,

said
the
ecclesiastic
,
``
come
back
quickly
from
*NL*
Tembleque
,
and
stay
not
to
bury
the
gentleman
,
unless
you
are
determined
*NL*
upon
more
burials
.
Pray
make
an
end
of
your
tale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
business
,
then
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
was
this
,
that
,
they
being
ready
*NL*
to
sit
down
to
table
,
--
methinks
I
see
them
plainer
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
and
duchess
were
highly
diverted
at
the
impatience
of
the
good
*NL*
ecclesiastic
,
and
at
the
length
and
pauses
of
Sancho
's
tale
;
but
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
almost
suffocated
with
rage
and
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
then
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
that
,
as
they
were
both
standing
before
*NL*
the
dinner-table
,
just
ready
to
sit
down
,
the
farmer
insisted
that
the
*NL*
gentleman
should
take
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
and
the
gentleman
as
*NL*
positively
pressed
the
farmer
to
take
it
,
saying
he
ought
to
be
master
*NL*
in
his
own
house
.
But
the
countryman
,
piquing
himself
upon
his
good
*NL*
breeding
,
still
refused
to
comply
,
till
the
gentleman
,
losing
all
*NL*
patience
,
laid
both
his
hands
upon
the
farmer
's
shoulders
,
and
made
him
*NL*
sit
down
by
main
force
,
saying
,
`
Sit
thee
down

for
in

place
I
am

that
is

That
is
my

truly
I

it
comes
in

pretty
much

the

INSTRUCTIONS
WHICH
DON
QUIXOTE
GAVE
TO
SANCHO
PANZA
BEFORE
HE
WENT
TO
*NL*
HIS
GOVERNMENT
;
WITH
OTHER
WELL
CONSIDERED
MATTERS
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
and
duchess
being
so
well
pleased
with
the
afflicted
duenna
,
*NL*
were
encouraged
to
proceed
with
other
projects
,
seeing
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
too
extravagant
for
the
credulity
of
the
knight
and
squire
.
The
*NL*
necessary
orders
were
accordingly
issued
to
their
servants
and
vassals
*NL*
with
regard
to
their
behavior
towards
Sancho
in
his
government
of
the
*NL*
promised
island
.
The
day
after
the
flight
of
Clavileno
,
the
duke
bade
*NL*
Sancho
prepare
,
and
get
himself
in
readiness
to
assume
his
office
,
for
*NL*
his
islanders
were
already
wishing
for
him
as
for
rain
in
May
.
Sancho
*NL*
made
a
low
bow
,
and
said
:
``
Ever
since
my
journey
to
heaven
,
when
I
*NL*
looked
down
and
saw
the
earth
so
very
small
,
my
desire
to
be
a
governor
*NL*
has
partly
cooled
:
for
what
mighty
matter
is
it
to
command
on
a
spot
no
*NL*
bigger
than
a
grain
of
mustard-seed
;
where
is
the
majesty
and
pomp
of
*NL*
governing
half
a
dozen
creatures
no
bigger
than
hazel-nuts
?
If
your
*NL*
lordship
will
be
pleased
to
offer
me
some
small
portion
of
heaven
,
*NL*
though
it
be
but
half
a
league
,
I
would
jump
at
it
sooner
than
for
the
*NL*
largest
island
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
you
,
friend
Sancho
,
''
answered
the
duke
,
``
I
can
give
away
no
part
*NL*
of
heaven
,
not
even
a
nail
's
breadth
;
for
God
has
reserved
to
Himself
*NL*
the
disposal
of
such
favors
:
but
what
it
is
in
my
power
to
give
,
I
give
*NL*
you
with
all
my
heart
;
and
the
island
I
now
present
to
you
is
ready
*NL*
made
,
round
and
sound
,
well-proportioned
,
and
above
measure
fruitful
,
*NL*
and
where
,
by
good
management
,
you
may
yourself
,
with
the
riches
of
the
*NL*
earth
,
purchase
an
inheritance
in
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
let
this
island
be
forthcoming
,
and
it
*NL*
shall
go
hard
with
me
but
I
will
be
such
a
governor
that
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
rogues
,
heaven
will
take
me
in
.
Nor
is
it
out
of
covetousness
that
I
*NL*
forsake
my
humble
cottage
and
aspire
to
greater
things
,
but
the
desire
I
*NL*
have
to
taste
what
it
is
to
be
a
governor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
once
you
taste
it
,
Sancho
,
''
quoth
the
duke
,
``
you
will
lick
your
*NL*
fingers
after
it
;
so
sweet
it
is
to
command
and
be
obeyed
.
And
certain
I
*NL*
am
,
when
your
master
becomes
an
emperor
,
of
which
there
is
no
doubt
,
as
*NL*
matters
proceed
so
well
,
it
would
be
impossible
to
wrest
his
power
from
*NL*
him
,
and
his
only
regret
will
be
that
he
had
it
not
sooner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
,
sir
,
you
are
in
the
right
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
it
is
pleasant
to
*NL*
govern
,
though
it
be
but
a
flock
of
sheep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
be
buried
with
you
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
the
duke
,
``
if
you
know
not
*NL*
something
of
every
thing
,
and
I
doubt
not
you
will
prove
a
pearl
of
a
*NL*
governor
.
But
enough
of
this
for
the
present
:
to-morrow
you
surely
*NL*
depart
for
your
island
,
and
this
evening
you
shall
be
fitted
with
*NL*
suitable
apparel
and
with
all
things
necessary
for
your
appointment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clothe
me
as
you
will
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
shall
still
be
Sancho
Panza
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
duke
;
``
but
the
garb
should
always
be
suitable
*NL*
to
the
office
and
rank
of
the
wearer
:
for
a
lawyer
to
be
habited
like
a
*NL*
soldier
,
or
a
soldier
like
a
priest
,
would
be
preposterous
;
and
you
;
*NL*
Sancho
,
must
be
clad
partly
like
a
scholar
and
partly
like
a
soldier
;
*NL*
as
,
in
the
office
you
will
hold
,
arms
and
learning
are
united
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
learning
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
I
have
not
much
of
that
,
for
I
*NL*
hardly
know
my
A
B
C
;
but
to
be
a
good
governor
,
it
will
be
enough
that
*NL*
I
am
able
to
make
my
Christ-cross
;
and
as
to
arms
,
I
shall
handle
such
*NL*
as
are
given
me
till
I
fall
,
and
so
God
help
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
so
good
an

the
duke
,
``
Sancho
can
not
do
wrong

*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
were
joined
by
Don
Quixote
,
who
understanding
the
subject
of
*NL*
their
conversation
,
and
the
short
space
allotted
to
Sancho
to
prepare
*NL*
for
his
departure
,
took
the
squire
by
the
hand
,
with
the
duke
's
*NL*
permission
,
and
led
him
to
his
apartment
,
in
order
to
instruct
him
how
*NL*
to
behave
in
his
office
.
Having
entered
the
chamber
he
locked
the
door
,
*NL*
and
obliging
Sancho
to
sit
down
by
him
,
spoke

``
I
return
infinite
thanks
to
Heaven

friend
Sancho

having
ordained

before
I
myself
have
met
with
the
least
success

good
fortune
hath
*NL*
gone
forth
to
bid
thee
welcome
.
I
,
who
had
balanced
the
remuneration
of
*NL*
thy
service
in
my
own
prosperity
,
find
myself
in
the
very
rudiments
of
*NL*
promotion
;
while
thou
,
before
thy
time
,
and
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
*NL*
reasonable
progression
,
findest
thy
desire
accomplished
:
other
people
*NL*
bribe
,
solicit
,
importune
,
attend
levees
,
entreat
,
and
persevere
,
*NL*
without
obtaining
their
suit
;
and
another
comes
,
who
,
without
knowing
*NL*
why
or
wherefore
,
finds
himself
in
possession
of
that
office
to
which
so
*NL*
many
people
laid
claim
:
and
here
the
old
saying
is
aptly
introduced
,
'
A
*NL*
pound
of
good
luck
is
worth
a
ton
of
merit

Thou
,
who
,
in
comparison
to
*NL*
me

art
doubtless
an
ignorant
dunce
,
without
rising
early
or
sitting
up
*NL*
late
,
or
,
indeed
,
exerting
the
least
industry
:
without
any
pretension
*NL*
more
or
less
than
that
of
being
breathed
upon

*NL*

created
governor

it

``
All
this
I
observe
,
O
Sancho
,
that
thou
mayst
not
attribute
thy
success
*NL*
to
thy
own
deserts
:
but
give
thanks
to
heaven
for
having
disposed
*NL*
matters
so
beneficially
in
thy
behalf
,
and
then
make
thy
acknowledgments
*NL*
to
that
grandeur
which
centres
in
the
profession
of
knight-errantry

Thy
*NL*

being
thus
predisposed
to
believe
what
I
have
said

be
attentive

*NL*
O
my
son

me

am
thy
Cato

thy
counsellor

thy
north-pole
and
*NL*
guide
,
to
conduct
thee
into
a
secure
harbor
from
the
tempestuous
sea
*NL*
into
which
thou
art
going
to
be
engulfed
;
for
great
posts
and
offices
of
*NL*
state
are
no
other
than
a
profound
gulf
of
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
O
my
son
,
you
are
to
fear
God
:
the
fear
of
God
is
*NL*
the
beginning
of
wisdom
;

if
you
are
wise
you
can
not
err
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Secondly

you
must
always
remember
who
you
are
,

endeavor
to
know
*NL*
yourself
,
--
a
study
of
all
others
the
most
difficult
.
This
self-knowledge
*NL*
will
hinder
you
from
blowing
yourself
up

the
frog
in

to
rival
*NL*
the
size
of

ox
:
if

therefore
,
you
succeed
in
this
learning

the

thy
having
been
a
swineherd

apprehend

risen

*NL*
OF
THE
SECOND
SERIES
OF
INSTRUCTIONS
DON
QUIXOTE
GAVE
TO
SANCHO
PANZA
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
that
has
duly
considered
Don
Quixote
's
instructions
to
his
squire
*NL*
would
not
have
taken
him
for
a
person
of
singular
intelligence
and
*NL*
discretion
?
But
,
in
truth
,
as
it
has
often
been
said
in
the
progress
of
*NL*
this
great
history
,
he
raved
only
on
the
subject
of
chivalry
;
on
all
*NL*
others
he
manifested
a
sound
and
discriminating
understanding
;
wherefore
*NL*
his
judgment
and
his
actions
appeared
continually
at
variance
.
But
,
in
*NL*
these
second
instructions
given
to
Sancho
,
which
showed
much
ingenuity
,
*NL*
his
wisdom
and
frenzy
are
both
singularly
conspicuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
this
private
conference
,
Sancho
listened
to
his
*NL*
master
with
great
attention
,
and
endeavored
so
to
register
his
counsel
*NL*
in
his
mind
that
he
might
thereby
be
enabled
to
bear
the
burden
of
*NL*
government
and
acquit
himself
honorably
.
Don
Quixote
now
proceeded
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
regulation
of
thine
own
person
and
domestic
concerns
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
in
the
first
place
,
Sancho
,
I
enjoin
thee
to
be
cleanly
in
all
*NL*
things
.
Keep
the
nails
of
thy
fingers
constantly
and
neatly
pared
,
nor
*NL*
suffer
them
to
grow
as
some
do
,
who
ignorantly
imagine
that
long
nails
*NL*
beautify
the
hand
,
and
account
the
excess
of
that
excrement
simply
a
*NL*
finger-nail
,
whereas
it
is
rather
the
talon
of
the
lizard-hunting
*NL*
kestrel
,
--
a
foul
and
unsightly
object
.
A
slovenly
dress
betokens
a
*NL*
careless
mind
;
or
,
as
in
the
case
of
Julius
Caesar
,
it
may
be
attributed
*NL*
to
cunning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Examine
prudently
the
income

afford
thee

give

thy
servants

give
them
such
as
are
decent

lasting

rather
than
gaudy
and
modish
;

what
thou
shalt
thus
save
in
*NL*
thy
servants
bestow
on
the
poor
;
so
shalt
thou
have
attendants
both
in
*NL*
heaven
and
earth

a
provision
which
our
vain-glorious
great
never
think
*NL*
of
.

*NL*
``
Eat
neither
garlic
nor
onions

lest
the
smell
betray

rusticity

Walk
with
gravity

speak
deliberately
,
but
not
so
as
to
seem
to
be
*NL*
listening
to
thyself
;
for
affectation
is
odious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eat
little
at
dinner

less
at
supper

with
moderation

``
In
the
next
place
,
Sancho
,
do
not
intermix
in
thy
discourse
such
a
*NL*
multitude
of
proverbs
as
thou
wert
wont
to
do
;
for
though
proverbs
are
*NL*
concise
and
pithy
sentences
,
thou
dost
so
often
drag
them
in
by
the
head
*NL*
and
shoulders
that
they
look
more
like
the
ravings
of
distraction
than
*NL*
well-chosen
apothegms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
defect
God
himself
must
remedy
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
I
have
more
*NL*
proverbs
by
heart
than
would
be
sufficient
to
fill

large
book
;
and
,
*NL*
when
I
speak
,
they
crowd
together
in
such
a
manner
as
to
quarrel
for

utterance

so
that
my
tongue
discharges
them
just
as
they
happen
to
be

in
the
way

they
are
or
are
not
to
the
purpose

will
take

care
henceforward

throw
out
those
that

there

and

opposite

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
all
the
advice
,
friend
Sancho
,
that
occurs
to
me
at
present
;
*NL*
hereafter
,
as
occasions
offer
,
my
instructions
will
be
ready

provided

thou
art
mindful

inform

of
the

of
thy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
I
see
very
well
that
all
your
worship
has
told
*NL*
me
is
wholesome
and
profitable
;
but
what
shall
I
be
the
better
for
it
if
*NL*
I
can
not
keep
it
in
my
head
?
It
is
true
,
I
shall
not
easily
forget
what
*NL*
you
have
said
about
paring
my
nails
,
and
marrying
again
if
the
*NL*
opportunity
offers
;
but
for
your
other
quirks
and
quillets
,
I
protest
*NL*
they
have
already
gone
out
of
my
head
as
clean
as
last
year
's
clouds
;
*NL*
and
therefore
,
let
me
have
them
in
writing
;
for
though
I
can
not
read
*NL*
them
myself
,
I
will
give
them
to
my
confessor
,
that
he
may
repeat
and
*NL*
drive
them
into
me
in
time
of
need
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
defend
me
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
how
scurvy
doth
it
look
in
a
*NL*
governor
to
be
unable
to
read
or
write
!
Indeed
,
Sancho
,
I
must
needs
*NL*
tell
thee
that
when
a
man
has
not
been
taught
to
read
,
or
is
*NL*
left-handed
,
it
argues
that
his
parentage
was
very
low
,
or
that
,
in
*NL*
early
life
,
he
was
so
indocile
and
perverse
that
his
teachers
could
beat
*NL*
nothing
good
into
him
.
Truly
this
is
a
great
defect
in
thee
,
and
*NL*
therefore
I
would
have
thee
learn
to
write
,
even
if
it
were
only
thy
*NL*
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
do
already
,
''
quoth
Sancho
;
``
for
when
I
was
steward
of
the
*NL*
brotherhood
in
our
village
,
I
learned
to
make
certain
marks
like
those
*NL*
upon
wool-packs
,
which
they
told
me
,
stood
for
my
name
.
But
,
at
the
*NL*
worst
,
I
can
feign
a
lameness
in
my
right
hand
,
and
get
another
to
sign
*NL*
for
me
:
there
is
a
remedy
for
every
thing
but
death
;
and
,
having
the
*NL*
staff
in
my
hand
,
I
can
do
what
I
please
.
Besides
,
as
your
worship
*NL*
knows
,
he
whose
father
is
mayor
-LSB-

-RSB-
--
and
I
,
being
governor
,
am
,
I
trow
,
*NL*
something
more
than
mayor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

ay

let
them
come
that
list

play
at
bo-peep

ay

fleer
and
*NL*
backbite
me
;
but
they
may
come
for
wool
and
go
back
shorn
:
`
His
home
is
*NL*
savory
whom
God
loves
;
'
--
besides
,
`
The
rich
man
's
blunders
pass
current
*NL*
for
wise
maxims
;
'
so
that
I
,
being
a
governor
,
and
therefore
wealthy
,
*NL*
and
bountiful
to
boot
--
as
I
intend
to
be
--
nobody
will
see
any
blemish
in
*NL*
me
.
No

no
,
let
the
clown
daub
himself
with
honey
,
and
he
will
never
*NL*
want
flies
.
`
As
much
as
you
have

just
so
much
you
are
worth

said
my
*NL*
grandam
;
revenge
yourself
upon
the
rich
who
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
confound
thee

''
exclaimed
Don
Quixote
;
``
sixty
thousand
devils
*NL*
take
thee
and
thy
proverbs

This
hour
,
or
more
,
thou
hast
been
stringing
*NL*
thy
musty
wares

poisoning
and
torturing
me
without
mercy
.
Take
my
word
*NL*
for
it
,
these
proverbs
will
one
day
bring
thee
to
the
gallows
;
--
they
*NL*
will
surely
provoke
thy
people
to
rebellion
!
Where
dost
thou
find
them
?
*NL*
How
shouldst
thou
apply
them
,
idiot
?
for
I
toil
and
sweat
as
if
I
were
*NL*
delving
the
ground
to
utter
but
one

and
apply
it
properly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
Heaven
,
master
of
mine

''
replied
Sancho
,
``
your
worship
complains
*NL*
of
very
trifles

Why
,
in
the
devil

name
,
are
you
angry
that
I
make
use
*NL*
of
my
own
goods
?
for
other
stock
I
have
none
,
nor
any
stock
but
proverbs
*NL*
upon
proverbs
;
and
just
now
I
have
four
ready
to
pop
out
,
all
pat
and
*NL*
fitting
as
pears
in

pannier

but
I
am

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
art
thou
vilely
miscalled
,
''
quoth
Don
Quixote
,
``
being
an
eternal
*NL*
babbler
.
Nevertheless
,
I
would
fain
know
these
four
proverbs
that
come
*NL*
so
pat
to
the
purpose
;
for
I
have
been
rummaging
my
own
memory
,
which
is
*NL*
no
bad
one
,
but
for
the
soul
of
me
,
I
can
find
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
there
be
better
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
than
--
`
Never
venture
your
fingers
*NL*
between
two
eye-teeth
;
'
and
with
`
Get
out
of
my
house
--
what
would
you
*NL*
have
with
my
wife
?
'
there
is
no
arguing
;
and
,
`
Whether
the
pitcher
hits
*NL*
the
stone
,
or
the
stone
hits
the
pitcher
,
it
goes
ill
with
the
pitcher
.
'
*NL*
All
these
,
your
worship
must
see
,
fit
to
a
hair
.
Let
no
one
meddle
with
*NL*
the
governor
or
his
deputy
,
or
he
will
come
off
the
worst
,
like
him
who
*NL*
claps
his
finger
between
two
eye-teeth
,
and
though
they
were
not
*NL*
eye-teeth
,
't
is
enough
if
they
be
but
teeth
.
To
what
a
governor
says
*NL*
there
is
no
replying
,
any
more
than
to
`
Get
out
of
my
house
--
what
*NL*
business
have
you
with
my
wife
?
'
Then
as
to
the
stone
and
the
pitcher
--
a
*NL*
blind
man
may
see
that
.
So
he
who
points
to
the
mote
in
another
man
's
*NL*
eye
,
should
first
look
to
the
beam
in
his
own
,
that
it
may
not
be
said
*NL*
of
him
,
the
dead
woman
was
afraid
of
her
that
was
flayed
.
Besides
,
your
*NL*
worship
knows
well
that
the
fool
knows
more
in
his
own
house
than
the
*NL*
wise
in
that
of
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
Sancho
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
fool
knows
nothing
,
either
*NL*
in
his
own
or
any
other
house
;
for
knowledge
is
not

erected
upon
*NL*
so
bad
a
foundation
as
folly

But
here
let
it
rest
,
Sancho

for
,
if
thou
*NL*

ill

though
the
fault
will
be
thine

the
shame
will
be
mine

*NL*
However

I
am
comforted

having
given
thee
the
best
counsel
in
my

power

therein
having
done
my

I
am
acquitted
both
of
my

promise
;
so
God
speed
thee
,
Sancho

and
govern
thee
in
*NL*
thy
government

deliver
me
from
the
fears
I
entertain
that
thou
wilt

turn
the

topsy-turvy

which
,
indeed
,
I
might
prevent
by
*NL*
letting
the

know
what
thou
art
,
and
telling
him
that
all
that
*NL*
paunch-gut
and
little
carcass
of
thine
is
nothing
but
a
sack
full
of
*NL*
proverbs
and
impertinence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Signor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
if
your
worship
really
thinks
I
am
not
*NL*
qualified
for
that
government
,
I
renounce
it
from
henceforward
forever
,
*NL*
amen
.
I
have
a
greater
regard
for
a
nail
's
breadth
of
my
soul
than
my
*NL*
whole
body
;
and
I
can
subsist
,
as
bare
Sancho
,
upon
a
crust
of
bread
and
*NL*
an
onion
,
as
well
as
governor
on
capons
and
partridges
;
for
,
while
we
*NL*
sleep
,
great
and
small
,
rich
and
poor
,
are
equal
all
.
If
your
worship
*NL*
will
consider
,
your
worship
will
find
that
you
yourself
put
this
scheme
*NL*
of
government
into
my
head
.
As
for
my
own
part
,
I
know
no
more
of
the
*NL*
matter
than
a
bustard
;
and
,
if
you
think
the
governorship
will
be
the
*NL*
means
of
my
going
to
the
devil
,
I
would
much
rather
go
as
simple
Sancho
*NL*
to
Heaven
than
as
a
governor
to
hell-fire
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
God

cried
the
knight
,
``
from
these
last
reflections
thou
hast
*NL*
uttered

I
pronounce
thee
worthy

thousand

Thou
hast
*NL*
an
excellent
natural
disposition
,
without
which
all
science
is
naught

*NL*
Recommend
thyself
to

endeavor

avoid
errors

I

thy

unshaken
purpose
be

righteously

always
favors

And
now
let

go

wait

*NL*
*NL*
Without
discretion
there
can
be
no

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
O
poverty
,
poverty
!
I
know
not
what
should
induce
the
great
Cordovan
*NL*
poet
to
call
thee
a
holy
,
unrequited
gift
.
I
,
though
a
Moor
,
am
very
*NL*
sensible
,
from
my
correspondence
with
Christians
,
that
holiness
consists
*NL*
in
charity
,
humility
,
faith
,
poverty
,
and
obedience
;
yet
,
nevertheless
,
*NL*
I
will
affirm
that
he
must
be
holy
indeed
,
who
can
sit
down
content
with
*NL*
poverty
,
unless
we
mean
that
kind
of
poverty
to
which
one
of
the
*NL*
greatest
saints
alludes
,
when
he
says
,
``
Possess
of
all
things
as
not
*NL*
possessing
them
;
''
and
this
is
called
spiritual
poverty
.
But
thou
second
*NL*
poverty
,
which
is
the
cause
I
spoke
of
,
why
wouldst
thou
assault
*NL*
gentlemen
of
birth
rather
than
any
other
class
of
people
?
Why
dost
thou
*NL*
compel
them
to
cobble
their
shoes
,
and
wear
upon
their
coats
one
button
*NL*
of
silk
,
another
of
hair
,
and
a
third
of
glass
?
Why
must
their
ruffs
be
*NL*
generally
yellow
and
ill-starched
?
-LRB-
By
the
by
,
from
this
circumstance
we
*NL*
learn
the
antiquity
of
ruffs
and
starch
.
But
thus
he
proceeds
:-RRB-
O
*NL*
wretched
man
of
noble
pedigree

who
is
obliged
to
administer
cordials
to
*NL*
his
honor

in
the
midst
of
hunger
and
solitude
,
by
playing
the
hypocrite
*NL*
with
a
toothpick
,
which
he
affects
to
use
in
the
street
,
though
he
has
*NL*
eat
nothing
to
require
that
act
of
cleanliness
.
Wretched
he
,
I
say
,
*NL*
whose
honor
is
ever
apt
to
be
startled
,
and
thinks
that
everybody
at
a
*NL*
league
's
distance
observes
the
patch
upon
his
shoe
,
his
greasy
hat
,
and
*NL*
his
threadbare
cloak
,
and
even
the
hunger
that
consumes
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Better
a
blush
on
the
face
than
a
stain
in
the
heart

not

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
SERENADE
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
forthwith
imagined
that
some
damsel
belonging
to
the
duchess
had
*NL*
become
enamored
of
him
.
Though
somewhat
fearful
of
the
beautiful
foe
,
he
*NL*
resolved
to
fortify
his
heart
,
and
on
no
account
to
yield
;
so
,
*NL*
commending
himself
with
fervent
devotion
to
his
mistress
,
Dulcinea
del
*NL*
Toboso
,
he
determined
to
listen
to
the
music
;
and
to
let
the
damsel
know
*NL*
he
was
there
he
gave
a
feigned
sneeze
,
at
which
they
were
not
a
little
*NL*
pleased
,
as
they
desired
above
all
things
that
he
should
hear
them
.
The
*NL*
harp
being
now
tuned

Altisidora
began
the
following
song

began
the

the

,
fetching

said
within

*NL*

*NL*
which
love
bestowed
upon

in
the
conquest

the
*NL*
surrender
of
my

Take

that
to

alone
I
am

to

To

HOW
THE
GREAT
SANCHO
PANZA
TOOK
POSSESSION
OF
HIS
ISLAND
,
AND
OF
THE
*NL*
MANNER
OF
HIS
BEGINNING
TO
GOVERN
IT
.
--
THE
GOVERNOR
'S
WISDOM
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
thou
ceaseless
discoverer
of
the
antipodes
,
torch
of
the
world
,
eye
of
*NL*
Heaven
,
and
sweet
cause
of
earthen
wine

;
here
Thymbrius
,
there
*NL*
Phoebus
;
here
archer
,
there
physician
,
father
of
poesy
,
inventor
of
*NL*
music
;
thou
who
always
risest
,
and
,
though
thou
seemest
to
do
so
,
never
*NL*
settest
,
--
to
thee
I
speak
,
O
sun
!
thee
I
invoke
to
favor
and
enlighten
*NL*
the
obscurity
of
the
great
Sancho
Panza
;
without
thee
I
find
myself
*NL*
indolent
,
dispirited
,
and
confused
!
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
then
,
with
all
his
attendants
,
arrived
at
a
town
containing
*NL*
about
a
thousand
inhabitants
,
which
was
one
of
the
largest
and
best
the
*NL*
duke
had
.
They
gave
him
to
understand
that
it
was
called
the
island
of
*NL*
Barataria
,
either
because
Barataria
was
really
the
name
of
the
place
,
or
*NL*
because
he
obtained
the
government
of
it
at
so
cheap
a
rate
.
On
his
*NL*
arrival
near
the
gates
of
the
town
,
which
was
walled
about
,
the
*NL*
municipal
officers
came
out
to
receive
him
.
The
bells
rung
,
and
,
with
*NL*
all
the
demonstrations
of
a
general
joy
and
a
great
deal
of
pomp
,
the
*NL*
people
conducted
him
to
the
great
church
to
give
thanks
to
God
.
*NL*
Presently
after
,
with
certain
ridiculous
ceremonies
,
they
presented
him
*NL*
the
keys
of
the
town
and
constituted
him
perpetual
governor
of
the
*NL*
island
of
Barataria
.
The
garb
,
the
beard
,
the
thickness
and
shortness
of
*NL*
the
new
governor
,
surprised
all
who
were
not
in
the
secret
,
and
,
indeed
,
*NL*
those
who
were
,
who
were
not
a
few
.
In
fine
,
as
soon
as
they
had
brought
*NL*
him
out
of
the
church
,
they
carried
him
to
the
tribunal
of
justice
and
*NL*
placed
him
in
the
chair
.
The
duke
's
steward
then
said
to
him
,
``
It
is
an
*NL*
ancient
custom
here
,
my
lord
governor
,
that
he
who
comes
to
take
*NL*
possession
of
this
famous
island
is
obliged
to
answer
a
question
put
to
*NL*
him
,
which
is
to
be
somewhat
intricate
and
difficult
.
By
his
answer
the
*NL*
people
are
enabled
to
feel
the
pulse
of
their
new
governor
's
*NL*
understanding
,
and
,
accordingly
,
are
either
glad
or
sorry
for
his
*NL*
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
steward
was
saying
this
,
Sancho
was
staring
at
some
capital
*NL*
letters
written
on
the
wall
opposite
to
his
chair
,
and
,
being
unable
to
*NL*
read
,
he
asked
what
that
writing
was
on
the
wall
.
He
was
answered
,
``
Sir
,
*NL*
it
is
there
written
on
what
day
your
honor
took
possession
of
this
*NL*
island
.
The
inscription
runs
thus
:
`
This
day
,
such
a
day
of
the
month
*NL*
and
year
,
Signor
Don
Sancho
Panza
took
possession
of
this
island
.
Long
*NL*
may
he
enjoy
it
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
who
is
it
they
call
Don
Sancho
Panza
?
''
demanded
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
lordship
,
''
answered
the
steward
!
``
for
no
other
Panza
,
besides
him
*NL*
now
in
the
chair
,
ever
came
into
this
island
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
notice
,
then
,
brother
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
that
the
_
Don
_
does
not
*NL*
belong
to
me
,
nor
ever
did
to
any
of
my
family
.
I
am
called
plain
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
:
my
father
was
a
Sancho
,
and
my
grandfather
was
a
Sancho
,
and
they
*NL*
were
all
Panzas
,
without
any
addition
of
_
Dons
_
,
or
any
other
title
*NL*
whatever
.
I
fancy
there
are
more
_
Dons
_
than
stones
in
this
island
.
But
*NL*
enough
:
God
knows
my
meaning
:
and
perhaps
,
if
my
government
lasts
four
*NL*
days
,
I
may
weed
out
these
_
Dons
_
that
over-run
the
country
,
and
,
by
*NL*
their
numbers
,
are
as
troublesome
as
mosquitoes
and
cousins
.
On
with
*NL*
your
question
,
Master
Steward
,
and
I
will
answer
the
best
I
can
,
let
the
*NL*
people
be
sorry
or
rejoice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
two
men
came
into
the
court
,
the
one
clad
like
a
country
*NL*
fellow
,
and
the
other
like
a
tailor
,
with
a
pair
of
shears
in
his
hand
;
*NL*
and
the
tailor
said
:
``
My
lord
governor
,
I
and
this
countryman
come
*NL*
before
your
worship
by
reason
this
honest
man
came
yesterday
to
my
shop
*NL*
-LRB-
saving
your
presence
,
I
am
a
tailor
,
and
have
passed
my
examination
,
*NL*
God
be
thanked
-RRB-
,
and
putting
a
piece
of
cloth
into
my
hands
,
asked
me
,
*NL*
`
Sir
,
is
there
enough
of
this
to
make
me
a
cap
?
'
I
,
measuring
the
piece
,
*NL*
answered
Yes
.
Now
he
bade
me
view
it
again
,
and
see
if
there
was
not
*NL*
enough
for
two
.
I
guessed
his
drift
,
and
told
him
there
was
.
Persisting
*NL*
in
his
knavish
intentions
,
my
customer
went
on
increasing
the
number
of
*NL*
caps
,
and
I
still
saying
yes
,
till
we
came
to
five
caps
.
A
little
time
*NL*
ago
he
came
to
claim
them
.
I
offered
them
to
him
,
but
he
refuses
to
pay
*NL*
me
for
the
making
,
and
insists
I
shall
either
return
him
his
cloth
,
or
*NL*
pay
him
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
all
this
so
,
brother
?
''
demanded
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
the
man
;
``
but
pray
,
my
lord
,
make
him
produce
the
five
*NL*
caps
he
has
made
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
answered
the
tailor
;
and
pulling
his
hand
from
*NL*
under
his
cloak
,
he
showed
the
five
caps
on
the
ends
of
his
fingers
and
*NL*
thumb
,
saying
:
``
Here
are
the
five
caps
this
honest
man
would
have
me
*NL*
make
,
and
on
my
soul
and
conscience
,
not
a
shred
of
the
cloth
is
left
,
*NL*
and
I
submit
the
work
to
be
viewed
by
any
inspectors
of
the
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
present
laughed
at
the
number
of
the
caps
and
the
novelty
of
the
*NL*
suit
.
Sancho
reflected
a
moment
,
and
then
said
:
``
I
am
of
opinion
there
*NL*
needs
no
great
delay
in
this
suit
,
and
it
may
be
decided
very
equitably
*NL*
off-hand
.
Therefore
I
pronounce
,
that
the
tailor
lose
the
making
,
and
*NL*
the
countryman
the
stuff
,
and
that
the
caps
be
confiscated
to
the
use
of
*NL*
the
poor
:
and
there
is
an
end
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
sentence
Sancho
afterwards
passed
on
the
purse
of
the
herdsman
*NL*
caused
the
admiration
of
all
the
bystanders
,
this
excited
their
*NL*
laughter
.
However
,
what
the
governor
commanded
was
executed
,
and
two
old
*NL*
men
next
presented
themselves
before
him
.
One
of
them
carried
a
cane
in
*NL*
his
hand
for
a
staff
;
the
other
,
who
had
no
staff
,
said
to
Sancho
:
``
My
*NL*
lord
,
some
time
ago
I
lent
this
man
ten
crowns
of
gold
to
oblige
and
*NL*
serve
him
,
upon
condition
that
he
should
return
them
on
demand
.
I
let
*NL*
some
time
pass
without
asking
for
them
,
being
loth
to
put
him
to
a
*NL*
greater
strait
to
pay
me
than
he
was
in
when
I
lent
them
.
But
at
length
,
*NL*
thinking
it
full
time
to
be
repaid
,
I
asked
him
for
my
money
more
than
*NL*
once
,
but
to
no
purpose
:
he
not
only
refuses
payment
,
but
denies
the
*NL*
debt
,
and
says
I
never
lent
him
any
such
sum
,
or
,
if
I
did
that
he
had
*NL*
already
paid
me
.
I
have
no
witnesses
to
the
loan
,
nor
has
he
of
the
*NL*
payment
which
he
pretends
to
have
made
,
but
which
I
deny
;
yet
if
he
will
*NL*
swear
before
your
worship
that
he
has
returned
the
money
,
I
from
this
*NL*
minute
acquit
him
before
God
and
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say
you
to
this
,
old
gentleman
?
''
quoth
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
my
lord
,
''
replied
the
old
fellow
,
``
that
he
did
lend
me
the
*NL*
money
,
and
if
your
worship
pleases
to
hold
down
your
wand
of
justice
,
*NL*
since
he
leaves
it
to
my
oath
,
I
will
swear
I
have
really
and
truly
*NL*
returned
it
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
governor
accordingly
held
down
his
wand
,
and
the
old
fellow
,
seeming
*NL*
encumbered
with
his
staff
,
gave
it
to
his
creditor
to
hold
while
he
was
*NL*
swearing
;
and
then
taking
hold
of
the
cross
of
the
wand
,
he
said
it
was
*NL*
true
indeed
the
other
had
lent
him
ten
crowns
,
but
that
he
had
restored
*NL*
them
to
him
into
his
own
hand
;
but
having
,
he
supposed
,
forgotten
it
,
he
*NL*
was
continually
dunning
him
for
them
.
Upon
which
his
lordship
the
*NL*
governor
demanded
of
the
creditor
what
he
had
to
say
in
reply
to
the
*NL*
solemn
declaration
he
had
heard
.
He
said
that
he
submitted
,
and
could
*NL*
not
doubt
but
that
his
debtor
had
sworn
the
truth
;
for
he
believed
him
*NL*
to
be
an
honest
man
and
a
good
Christian
;
and
that
,
as
the
fault
must
*NL*
have
been
in
his
own
memory
,
he
would
thenceforward
ask
him
no
more
for
*NL*
his
money
.
The
debtor
now
took
his
staff
again
,
and
bowing
to
the
*NL*
governor
,
went
out
of
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
having
observed
the
defendant
take
his
staff
and
walk
away
,
and
*NL*
noticing
also
the
resignation
of
the
plaintiff
,
he
began
to
meditate
,
*NL*
and
laying
the
fore-finger
of
his
right
hand
upon
his
forehead
,
he
*NL*
continued
a
short
time
apparently
full
of
thought
;
and
then
raising
his
*NL*
head
,
he
ordered
the
old
man
with
the
staff
to
be
called
back
;
and
when
*NL*
he
had
returned
,
``
Honest
friend
,
''
said
the
governor
,
``
give
me
that
*NL*
staff
,
for
I
have
occasion
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
answered
the
old
fellow
;
and
delivered
it
into
his
*NL*
hand
.
Sancho
took
it
,
and
giving
it
to
the
other
old
man
,
said
:
``
Go
*NL*
about
your
business
,
in
God
's
name
,
for
you
are
paid
.
''
``
I
,
my
lord
,
''
*NL*
answered
the
old
man
;
``
what
!
is
this
cane
worth
ten
golden
crowns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
quoth
the
governor
,
``
or
I
am
the
greatest
dunce
in
the
world
!
and
*NL*
now
it
shall
appear
whether
I
have
a
head
to
govern
a
whole
kingdom
.
''
*NL*
Straight
he
commanded
the
cane
to
be
broken
before
them
all
.
Which
being
*NL*
done
there
were
found
in
the
hollow
of
it
ten
crowns
in
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
struck
with
admiration
,
and
took
their
new
governor
for
a
*NL*
second
Solomon
.
They
asked
him
,
whence
he
had
collected
that
the
ten
*NL*
crowns
were
in
the
cane
.
He
answered
,
that
upon
seeing
the
old
man
give
*NL*
it
his
adversary
,
while
he
was
taking
the
oath
,
and
swearing
that
he
*NL*
had
really
and
truly
restored
them
into
his
own
hands
,
and
,
when
he
had
*NL*
done
,
ask
for
it
again
,
it
came
into
his
imagination
,
the
money
in
*NL*
dispute
must
be
in
the
hollow
of
the
cane
.
Whence
it
may
be
gathered
,
*NL*
that
,
God
Almighty
often
directs
the
judgment
of
those
who
govern
,
*NL*
though
otherwise
mere
blockheads
:
besides
,
he
had
heard
the
priest
of
*NL*
his
parish
tell
a
like
case
;
and
,
were
it
not
that
he
was
so
unlucky
as
*NL*
to
forget
all
he
had
a
mind
to
remember
,
his
memory
was
so
good
,
there
*NL*
would
not
have
been
a
better
in
the
whole
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
both
the
old
men
marched
off
,
the
one
ashamed
,
and
the
other
*NL*
satisfied
;
the
bystanders
were
surprised
,
and
the
secretary
,
who
minuted
*NL*
down
the
words
,
actions
,
and
behavior
of
Sancho
Panza
,
could
not
*NL*
determine
with
himself
,
whether
he
should
set
him
down
for
a
wise
man
or
*NL*
a
fool
.
All
the
court
were
in
admiration
at
the
acuteness
and
wisdom
of
*NL*
their
new
governor
;
all
of
whose
sentences
and
decrees
,
being
noted
down
*NL*
by
the
appointed
historiographer
,
were
immediately
transmitted
to
the
*NL*
duke
,
who
waited
for
these
accounts
with
the
utmost
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
see
that
governors
,
though
otherwise
fools
,
are
sometimes
*NL*
directed
in
their
decisions
by
the
hand
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
is
ever
moving
;
nothing
ever
can
impede
his
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
understanding
in
the
beginning
is
often
an
effectual
cure
*NL*
for
those
who
are
indiscreetly
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eleven
o'clock
Don
Quixote
retired
to
his
apartment
,
and
finding
a
*NL*
lute
there
,
he
tuned
it
,
opened
the
window
,
and
,
perceiving
there
was
*NL*
somebody
walking
in
the
garden
,
he
ran
over
the
strings
of
the
*NL*
instrument
;
and
,
having
tuned
it
again
as
nicely
as
he
could
,
he
coughed
*NL*
and
cleared
his
throat
;
and
then
,
with
a
voice
somewhat
hoarse
,
yet
not
*NL*
unmusical
,
he
sang
the
following
song
,
which
he
had
composed
himself
*NL*
that
very
day
:

THE
GOVERNOR
IN
A
RAGE
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
relates
that
Sancho
Panza
was
conducted
from
the
court
of
*NL*
justice
to
a
sumptuous
palace
,
where
in
a
great
hall
he
found
a
*NL*
magnificent
entertainment
prepared
.
He
had
no
sooner
entered
than
his
*NL*
ears
were
saluted
by
the
sound
of
many
instruments
,
and
four
pages
*NL*
served
him
with
water
to
wash
his
hands
,
which
the
governor
received
*NL*
with
becoming
gravity
.
The
music
having
ceased
,
Sancho
now
sat
down
to
*NL*
dinner
in
a
chair
of
state
placed
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
for
*NL*
there
was
but
one
seat
and
only
one
plate
and
napkin
.
A
personage
,
who
,
*NL*
as
it
afterwards
appeared
,
was
a
physician
,
took
his
stand
at
one
side
*NL*
of
his
chair
with
a
whalebone
rod
in
his
hand
.
They
then
removed
the
*NL*
beautiful
white
cloth
,
which
covered
a
variety
of
fruits
and
other
*NL*
eatables
.
Grace
was
said
by
one
in
a
student
's
dress
,
and
a
laced
bib
*NL*
was
placed
by
a
page
under
Sancho
's
chin
.
Another
,
who
performed
the
*NL*
office
of
sewer
,
now
set
a
plate
of
fruit
before
him
;
but
he
had
*NL*
scarcely
tasted
it
,
when
,
on
being
touched
by
the
wand-bearer
,
it
was
*NL*
snatched
away
,
and
another
containing
meat
instantly
supplied
its
place
.
*NL*
Yet
before
Sancho
could
make
a
beginning
it
vanished
,
like
the
former
,
*NL*
on
a
signal
of
the
wand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
governor
was
surprised
at
this
proceeding
,
and
looking
around
him
,
*NL*
asked
if
this
dinner
was
only
to
show
off
their
sleight
of
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lord
,
''
said
the
wand-bearer
,
``
your
lordship
's
food
must
here
be
*NL*
watched
with
the
same
care
as
is
customary
with
the
governors
of
other
*NL*
islands
.
I
am
a
doctor
of
physic
,
sir
,
and
my
duty
,
for
which
I
receive
*NL*
a
salary
,
is
to
watch
over
the
governor
's
health
,
whereof
I
am
more
*NL*
careful
than
of
my
own
.
I
study
his
constitution
night
and
day
,
that
I
*NL*
may
know
how
to
restore
him
when
sick
;
and
therefore
think
it
incumbent
*NL*
on
me
to
pay
especial
regard
to
his
meals
,
at
which
I
constantly
*NL*
preside
,
to
see
that
he
eats
what
is
good
and
salutary
,
and
prevent
his
*NL*
touching
whatever
I
imagine
may
be
prejudicial
to
his
health
or
*NL*
offensive
to
his
stomach
.
It
was
for
that
reason
,
my
lord
,
''
continued
*NL*
he
,
``
I
ordered
the
dish
of
fruit
to
be
taken
away
,
as
being
too
watery
,
*NL*
and
that
other
dish
,
as
being
too
hot
and
over-seasoned
with
spices
,
*NL*
which
are
apt
to
provoke
thirst
;
and
he
that
drinks
much
destroys
and
*NL*
consumes
the
radical
moisture
,
which
is
the
fuel
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
that
plate
of
roasted
partridges
,
which
*NL*
seem
to
me
to
be
very
well
seasoned
,
I
suppose
will
do
me
no
manner
of
*NL*
harm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
my
lord
governor
shall
not
eat
them
while
I
*NL*
live
to
prevent
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
why
not
?
''
quoth
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
answered
the
doctor
,
``
our
great
master
Hippocrates
,
the
north
*NL*
star
and
luminary
of
medicine
,
says
in
one
of
his
aphorisms
,
_
Omnis
*NL*
saturatio
mala
,
perdicis
autem
pessima
_
;
which
means
,
`
All
repletion
is
*NL*
bad
,
but
that
from
partridges
the
worst
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
be
so
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
pray
cast
your
eye
,
signor
doctor
,
over
*NL*
all
these
dishes
here
on
the
table
,
and
see
which
will
do
me
the
most
*NL*
good
or
the
least
harm
,
and
let
me
eat
of
it
without
whisking
it
away
*NL*
with
your
conjuring-stick
;
for
,
by
my
soul
,
and
as
Heaven
shall
give
me
*NL*
life
to
enjoy
this
government
,
I
am
dying
with
hunger
;
and
to
deny
me
*NL*
food
--
let
signor
doctor
say
what
he
will
--
is
not
the
way
to
lengthen
my
*NL*
life
,
but
to
cut
it
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
is
in
the
right
,
my
lord
governor
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
physician
,
``
and
therefore
I
am
of
opinion
you
should
not
eat
of
these
*NL*
stewed
rabbits
,
as
being
a
food
that
is
tough
and
acute
;
of
that
veal
,
*NL*
indeed
,
you
might
have
taken
a
little
,
had
it
been
neither
roasted
nor
*NL*
stewed
;
but
as
it
is
,
not
a
morsel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
think
you
,
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
of
that
huge
dish
there
,
smoking
*NL*
hot
,
which
I
take
to
be
an
olla-podrida
?
--
for
,
among
the
many
things
*NL*
contained
in
it
,
I
surely
may
light
upon
something
both
wholesome
and
*NL*
toothsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Absit
!
_
''
quoth
the
doctor
,
``
far
be
such
a
thought
from
us
.
*NL*
Olla-podrida
!
there
is
no
worse
dish
in
the
world
.
Leave
them
to
*NL*
prebends
and
rectors
of
colleges
or
lusty
feeders
at
country
weddings
;
*NL*
but
let
them
not
be
seen
on
the
tables
of
governors
,
where
nothing
*NL*
contrary
to
health
and
delicacy
should
be
tolerated
.
Simple
medicines
*NL*
are
always
more
estimable
and
safe
,
for
in
them
there
can
be
no
mistake
,
*NL*
whereas
in
such
as
are
compounded
all
is
hazard
and
uncertainty
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
what
I
would
at
present
advise
my
lord
governor
to
eat
,
in
*NL*
order
to
corroborate
and
preserve
his
health
,
is
about
a
hundred
small
*NL*
rolled-up
wafers
,
with
some
thin
slices
of
marmalade
,
that
may
sit
upon
*NL*
the
stomach
and
help
digestion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
hearing
this
,
threw
himself
backward
in
his
chair
,
and
looking
*NL*
at
the
doctor
from
head
to
foot
very
seriously
,
asked
him
his
name
and
*NL*
where
he
had
studied
.
To
which
he
answered
,
``
My
lord
governor
,
my
name
*NL*
is
Doctor
Pedro
Rezio
de
Aguero
;
I
am
a
native

place
called
*NL*
Tirteafuera
,
lying
between
Caraquel
and
Almoddobar
del
Campo
,
on
the
*NL*
right
hand
,
and
I
have
taken
my
doctor
's
degrees
in
the
university
of
*NL*
Ossuna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

Sancho
in
a
rage
,

out

my
*NL*
sight

instant
,
or
,
by

*NL*

For
those
who
are
learned

*NL*
wise
I
shall
make
much
of

honor

I
say
again

On
seeing
the
governor
in
such
a
fury
the
doctor
would
have
fled
out
in
*NL*
the
hall
had
not
the
sound

in
the
street
.
``
A
courier
from
my
lord
duke
,
''
said
the
sewer
-LRB-
who
*NL*
had
looked
out
of
the
window
-RRB-
,
``
and
he
must
certainly
have
brought
*NL*
despatches
of
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
courier
entered
hastily
,
foaming
with
sweat
and
in
great
agitation
,
*NL*
and
pulling
a
packet
out
of
his
bosom
,
he
delivered
it
into
the
*NL*
governor
's
hands
,
and
by
him
it
was
given
to
the
steward
,
telling
him
to
*NL*
read
the
superscription
,
which
was
this
:
``
To
Don
Sancho
Panza
,
Governor
*NL*
of
the
Island
of
Barataria
.
To
be
delivered
only
to
himself
or
to
his
*NL*
secretary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
my
secretary
?
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
,
my
lord
,
''
answered
one
who
was
present
,
``
for
I
can
read
and
*NL*
write
,
and
am
,
besides
,
a
Biscayan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
that
addition
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
you
may
very
well
be
secretary
to
*NL*
the
emperor
himself
.
Open
the
packet
and
see
what
it
holds

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
secretary
did
so
,
and
having
run
his
eye
over
the
contents
,
he
*NL*
said
it
was
a
business
which
required
privacy
.
Accordingly
,
Sancho
*NL*
commanded
all
to
retire
excepting
the
steward
and
sewer
;
and
when
the
*NL*
hall
was
cleared
,
the
secretary
read
the
following
letter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
just
come
to
my
knowledge
,
Signor
Don
Panza
,
that
certain
*NL*
enemies
of
mine
intend
very
soon
to
make
a
desperate
attack
,
by
night
,
*NL*
upon
the
island
under
your
command
;
it
is
necessary
,
therefore
,
to
be
*NL*
vigilant
and
alert
,
that
you
may
not
be
taken
by
surprise
.
I
have
also
*NL*
received
intelligence
from
trusty
spies
,
that
four
persons
in
disguise
*NL*
are
now
in
your
town
,
sent
thither
by
the
enemy
,
who
,
fearful
of
your
*NL*
great
talents
,
have
a
design
upon
your
life
.
Keep
a
strict
watch
,
be
*NL*
careful
who
are
admitted
to
you
,
and
eat
nothing
sent
you
as
a
present

*NL*
I
will
not
fail
to
send
you
assistance
if
you
are
in

of
it

*NL*
Whatever
may

attempted

I
have
full
reliance

From
this
place

16th
of
August

at
four
in
the
morning

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
astonished
at
this
information
,
and
the
others
appeared
to
be
*NL*
no
less
so
.
At
length
,
turning
to
the
steward
,
``
I
will
tell
you
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
the
first
thing
to
be
done
,
which
is
to
clap
Doctor
Rezio
into
a
*NL*
dungeon
;
for
if
anybody
has
a
design
to
kill
me
,
it
is
he
,
and
that
by
*NL*
the
most
lingering
and
the
worst
of
all
deaths
,
--
starvation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
that
as
it
may
,
''
said
the
steward
,
``
it
is
my
opinion
your
honor
*NL*
would
do
well
to
eat
none
of
the
meat
here
upon
the
table

for
it
was
*NL*
presented
by
some
nuns
,
and
it
is
a
saying
,
`
The
devil
lurks
behind
the
*NL*
cross

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
the
right

quoth
Sancho
,
``
and
for
the
present
give
me
only
*NL*
a
piece
of
bread

some
four
pounds
of
grapes

there
can
be
no
poison
*NL*
in
them
,

for
,
in
truth
,
I
can
not
live
without
food
,
and
if
we
must
keep
*NL*
in
readiness
for
these
battles
that
threaten
us
,
it
is
fit

we
*NL*
should
be
well
fed

for
the
stomach

the

Do
you

Mr.
Secretary

answer
the
letter
of
my
lord

tell
*NL*
him
his
commands
shall
be

throughout
most
faithfully

present
*NL*
my
dutiful

you

Now
away

A

THE

TALE

*NL*
*NL*
The
countryman
,
who
was
of
goodly
presence
,
then
came
in
,
and
it
might
*NL*
be
seen
a
thousand
leagues
off
that
he
was
an
honest
,
good
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
among
you
here
is
the
lord
governor
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
should
it
be

answered
the

,
``
but
he
who
is
seated
in

chair

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
humble
myself

quoth
the
countryman
;

kneeling

down
,
he
begged
for
his
hand
to
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
refused
it
,
and
commanded
him
to
rise
and
tell
his
business
.
The
*NL*
countryman
did
so
,
and
said
:
``
My
lord
,
I
am
a
husbandman
,
a
native
of

Miguel
Terra
,
two
leagues
from
Ciudad

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

another
Tirteafuera

''
quoth
Sancho

``
Say
on
,
brother

for
let
me
*NL*
tell
you
,
I
know
Miguel
Terra
very
well
;
it
is
not
very
far
from
my
own
*NL*
village
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
business
is
this
,
sir
,
''
continued
the
peasant
:
``
by
the
mercy
of
*NL*
Heaven
I
was
married
in
peace
and
in
the
face
of
the
holy
Roman
Catholic
*NL*
Church
.
I
have
two
sons
,
bred
scholars
;
the
younger
studies
for
*NL*
bachelor
,
and
the
elder
for
licentiate
.
I
am
a
widower
,
for
my
wife
*NL*
died
,
or
rather
a
wicked
physician
killed
her
by
improper
medicines
when
*NL*
she
was
pregnant
;
and
if
it
had
been
God
's
will
that
the
child
had
been
*NL*
born
,
and
had
proved
a
son
,
I
would
have
put
him
to
study
for
doctor
,
*NL*
that
he
might
not
envy
his
two
brothers

the
bachelor

the
*NL*
licentiate

``
So
that

quoth
Sancho

you
would
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

certainly

answered
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
much
the
nearer
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
go
on
,
friend
,
for
this
is
an
*NL*
hour
rather
for
bed
than
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
then
,
''
quoth
the
countryman
,
``
that
my
son
who
is
to
be
the
*NL*
bachelor
fell
in
love
with
a
damsel
in
the
same
village
,
called
Clara
*NL*
Perlerino
,
daughter
of
Andres
Perlerino
,
a
very
rich
farmer
;
which
name
*NL*
of
Perlerino
came
to
them
not
by
lineal
or
any
other
descent
,
but
*NL*
because
all
of
that
race
are
paralytic
;
and
to
mend
the
name
,
they
call
*NL*
them
Perlerinos
.
Indeed
,
to
say
the
truth
,
the
damsel
is
like
any
*NL*
oriental
pearl
,
and
looked
at
on
the
right
side
seems
a
very
flower
of
*NL*
the
field
;
but
on
the
left
not
quite
so
fair
,
for
on
that
side
she
wants
*NL*
an
eye
,
which
she
lost
by
the
small-pox
;
and
though
the
pits
in
her
face
*NL*
are
many
and
deep
,
her
admirers
say
they
are
not
pits
but
graves
wherein
*NL*
the
hearts
of
her
lovers
are
buried
.
So
clean
and
delicate
,
too
,
is
she
,
*NL*
that
to
prevent
defiling
her
face
,
she
carries
her
nose
so
hooked
up
*NL*
that
it
seems
to
fly
from
her
mouth
;
yet
for
all
that
she
looks
*NL*
charmingly
,
for
she
has
a
large
mouth
,
and
did
she
not
lack
half
a
score
*NL*
or
a
dozen
front
teeth
she
might
pass
and
make
a
figure
among
the
*NL*
fairest
.
I
say
nothing
of
her
lips
,
for
they
are
so
thin
that
,
were
it
*NL*
the
fashion
to
reel
lips
,
one
might
make
a
skein
of
them
;
but
,
being
of
*NL*
a
different
color
from
what
is
usual
in
lips
,
they
have
a
marvellous
*NL*
appearance
,
for
they
are
streaked
with
blue
,
green
,
and
orange-tawny
.
*NL*
Pardon
me
,
good
my
lord
governor
,
if
I
paint
so
minutely
the
parts
of
*NL*
her
who
is
about
to
become
my
daughter
;
for
in
truth
I
love
and
admire
*NL*
her
more
than
I
can
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paint
what
you
will
,
''
quoth
Sancho
,
``
for
I
am
mightily
taken
with
the
*NL*
picture
;
and
had
I
but
dined
,
I
would
not
desire
a
better
dessert
than
*NL*
your
portrait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
always
at
your

answered
the
peasant
;
``
and
the
*NL*
time
may
come
when
we
may

though
we
are
not
so
now

*NL*
I
assure
you
,
my
lord
,
if
I
could
but
paint
her
genteelness
and
the
*NL*
tallness
of
her
person
,
you
would
admire
:
but
that
can
not
be
,
because
*NL*
she
is
crooked
,

crumpled
up
together
,
and
her
knees
touch
her
mouth

*NL*
though
,
for
all
that

you
may
see
plainly
that
could
she

stand
*NL*
upright
she
would
touch
the
ceiling
with
her
head

And
she
would
ere
now

have
given
her
hand
to
my
bachelor
to
be
his
wife
,
but
that
she
can
not
*NL*
stretch
it
out

it
is
so
shrunk

nevertheless

her
long
guttered
nails

show
the
goodness

its
make

*NL*
``
So
far
so
good

quoth
Sancho

now

make
account
that
you

painted
her
from

it
you
would
be
at

Come
to

the
point
without

many
windings

so
many
fetches

digressions

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
desire

my

answered
the

``
is

that
your

favor

a
letter

her
father

begging
his
consent
to

match

since
we
are
pretty
equal

for

to
say
the
truth

my

scarcely

not

having
thereby

once
fallen
into

fire

his
face
is
as
shrivelled
as

piece

are
somewhat
bleared

Would

The

then
rising
,

seizing
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
*NL*
seated
,
exclaimed
,

*NL*
The
sewer
made
signs
to
the
countryman
to
go
out
of
the

which
he
*NL*
did
,
hanging
down
his
head

seemingly
much
afraid
lest
the

put
his

THE
GOVERNOR
'S
ROUND
OF
INSPECTION

*NL*
*NL*
After
traversing
a
few
streets
,
they
heard
the
clashing
of
swords
,
and
,
*NL*
hastening
to
the
place
,
they
found
two
men
fighting
.
On
seeing
the
*NL*
officers
coming
they
desisted
,
and
one
of
them
said
,
``
Help

in

name

*NL*
*NL*
His
antagonist
,
interposing
,
said
,
``
My

briefly

relate
the

from

above

heaven
knows
how

except
that
I
,
happening
to
be
*NL*
present

was
induced
,
even
against
my
conscience
,
to
give
judgment
in
*NL*
his
favor
in
many
a
doubtful
point
;
and
when
I
expected
he
would
have
*NL*
given
me
something
,
though
it
were
but
the
small
matter
of
a
crown
,
by
*NL*
way
of
present
,
as
it
is
usual
with
gentlemen
of
character
like
myself
,
*NL*
who
stand
by
,
ready
to
back
unreasonable
demands
,
and
to
prevent
*NL*
quarrels
,
up
he
got
,
with
his
pockets
filled
,
and
marched
out
of
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surprised
and
vexed
at
such
conduct
,
I
followed
him
,
civilly
reminded
*NL*
him
that
he
could
not
refuse
me
the
small
sum
of
eight
reals
,
as
he
knew
*NL*
me
to
be
a
man
of
honor

without
either
office

pension

my
parents
*NL*
having
brought

up

this

who
is
as
great
a
thief
*NL*
as
Cacus
,
and
as
arrant
a
sharper
as
Andradilla

would
give
me
but
four
*NL*
reals
!
Think
,
my
lord
governor

what
a
shameless

unconscionable
*NL*
fellow
he
is
!
But
as
I
live

it

coming

I

made
him
disgorge

how

accounts

*NL*
``
What
shall

replied
Sancho

``
is
this
:

here

A
MESSENGER
TO

PANZA

*NL*
*NL*
Being
desirous
to
please
his
lord
and
lady
,
he
set
off
with
much
glee
to
*NL*
Sancho
's
village
.
Having
arrived
near
it
,
he
inquired
of
some
women
whom
*NL*
he
saw
washing
in
a
brook
if
there
lived
not
in
that
town
one
Teresa
*NL*
Panza
,
wife
of
one
Sancho
Panza
,
squire
to
a
knight
called
Don
Quixote
*NL*
de

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Teresa
Panza

said
a
young
lass
who
was
washing
*NL*
among
the
rest
,
``
and
that
Sancho
my

master

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
so
?

quoth
the
page
:
``
come
then

my

lead
me
to

a
token
for
her
from
that

yours

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I

answered
the
girl
-LRB-
who
seemed
to
*NL*
be
about
fourteen
years
of
age
-RRB-
;
and
leaving
the
linen
she
was
washing
*NL*
to
one
of
her
companions
,
without
stopping
to
cover
either
her
head

*NL*
feet

away
she
ran
skipping
along
before
the
page
's
horse

bare-legged
,
*NL*
and
her
hair
dishevelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

hard
by

find

trouble
enough

long
*NL*
without
tidings
of
my

*NL*
*NL*
``

So
on
he
went

with
his
guide
running

skipping

and
capering
before
*NL*
him
,
till
they
reached
the
village

,
before
she
got
up
to
the
house

*NL*
she
called
out
aloud

*NL*
At
these
words
out
came
her
mother
Teresa
Panza
with
a
distaff
in
her
*NL*
hand
--
for
she
was
spinning
flax

She
was
clad
in
a
russet
petticoat
,
so
*NL*
short
that
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
docked
at
the
placket

with
a
*NL*
jacket
of
the
same

and
the
sleeves
of
her
under-garment
hanging
about
*NL*
it
.
She
appeared
to
be
about
forty
years
of
age
and
was
strong
,
hale
,
*NL*
sinewy
,
and
hard
as
a
hazel-nut

``

the

and
throwing
himself
from
his
horse

with
great
respect
he
went
*NL*
and
kneeled
before
the
Lady

saying

``
Alack-a-day

replied

set
in

accordingly
did

I
prevailed
upon
the
duke
,
my
spouse
,
to
make
him
*NL*
governor
of
one
of
the
many
islands
in
his
possession
.
I
am
informed
he
*NL*
governs
like
any
hawk
;
at
which
I
and
my
lord
duke
are
mightily
pleased
,
*NL*
and
give
many
thanks
to
Heaven
that
I
have
not
been
deceived
in
my
*NL*
choice
,
for
madam
Teresa
may
be
assured
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
*NL*
find
a
good
governor
--
and
God
make
me
as
good
as
Sancho
governs
well
.
I
*NL*
have
sent
you
,
my
dear
friend
,
a
string
of
corals
set
in
gold
--
I
wish
*NL*
they
were
oriental
pearls
;
but
whoever
gives
thee
a
bone
has
no
mind
to
*NL*
see
thee
dead
:
the
time
will
come
when
we
shall
be
better
acquainted
,
*NL*
and
converse
with
each
other
,
and
then
heaven
knows
what
may
happen
.
*NL*
Commend
me
to
your
daughter
Sanchica
,
and
tell
her
from
me
to
get
*NL*
herself
ready
;
for
I
mean
to
have
her
highly
married
when
she
least
*NL*
expects
it
.
I
am
told
the
acorns
near
your
town
are
very
large
--
pray
*NL*
send
me
some
two
dozen
of
them
;
for
I
shall
value
them
the
more
as
*NL*
coming
from
your
hand
.
Write
to
me
immediately
,
to
inform
me
of
your
*NL*
health
and
welfare
;
and
if
you
want
anything
,
you
need
but
open
your
*NL*
mouth
,

it
shall
be
measured
.
So
God
keep
you

calls

treats
me
as

bring
some
new-laid

out

slice
some
rashers

let
us
entertain
him

for
his
good
news

his

OF
THE
PROGRESS
OF
SANCHO
PANZA
'S
GOVERNMENT
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
business
that
occurred
on
that
day
was
an
appeal
to
his
*NL*
judgment
in
a
case
which
was
thus
stated
by
a
stranger
--
the
appellant
:
*NL*
``
My
lord
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
is
a
river
which
passes
through
the
domains
*NL*
of
a
certain
lord
,
dividing
it
into
two
parts
--
I
beseech
your
honor
to
*NL*
give
me
your
attention
,
for
it
is
a
case
of
great
importance
and
some
*NL*
difficulty
.
I
say
,
then
,
that
upon
this
river
there
was
a
bridge
,
and
at
*NL*
one
end
of
it
a
gallows
and
a
kind
of
court-house
,
where
four
judges
sit
*NL*
to
try
,
and
pass
sentence
upon
those
who
are
found
to
transgress
a
*NL*
certain
law
enacted
by
the
proprietor
,
which
runs
thus
:
`
Whoever
would
*NL*
pass
over
this
bridge
must
first
declare
upon
oath
whence
he
comes
,
and
*NL*
upon
what
business
he
is
going
;
and
if
he
swears
the
truth
,
he
shall
*NL*
pass
over
;
but
if
he
swears
to
a
falsehood
,
he
shall
certainly
die
upon
*NL*
a
gibbet
there
provided
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
this
law
was
made
known
,
many
persons
ventured
over
it
,
and
the
*NL*
truth
of
what
they
swore
being
admitted
,
they
were
allowed
freely
to
*NL*
pass
.
But
a
man
now
comes
demanding
a
passage
over
the
bridge
;
and
,
on
*NL*
taking
the
required
oath
,
he
swears
that
he
is
going
to
be
executed
*NL*
upon
the
gibbet
before
him
,
and
that
he
has
no
other
business
.
The
*NL*
judges
deliberated
,
but
would
not
decide
.
`
If
we
let
this
man
pass
*NL*
freely
,
'
said
they
,
`
he
will
have
sworn
falsely
,
and
by
the
law
,
he
*NL*
ought
to
die
:
and
,
if
we
hang
him
,
he
will
verify
his
oath
,
and
he
,
*NL*
having
sworn
the
truth
,
ought
to
have
passed
unmolested
as
the
law
*NL*
ordains
.
'
The
case
,
my
lord
,
is
yet
suspended
,
for
the
judges
know
not
*NL*
how
to
act
;
and
,
therefore
having
heard
of
your
lordship
's
great
wisdom
*NL*
and
acuteness
,
they
have
sent
me
humbly
to
beseech
your
lordship
on
*NL*
their
behalf
,
to
give
your
opinion
in
so
intricate
and
perplexing
a
*NL*
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
deal
plainly
with
you
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
these
gentlemen
judges
who
*NL*
sent
you
to
me
might
have
saved
themselves
and
you
the
labor
;
for
I
have
*NL*
more
of
the
blunt
than
the
acute
in
me
.
However
,
let
me
hear
your
*NL*
question
once
more
,
that
I
may
understand
it
the
better
,
and
mayhap
I
*NL*
may
chance
to
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
accordingly
told
his
tale
once
or
twice
more
,
and
when
he
had
*NL*
done
,
the
governor
thus
delivered
his
opinion
:
``
To
my
thinking
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
this
matter
may
soon
be
settled
;
and
I
will
tell
you
how
.
The
man
,
*NL*
you
say
,
swears
he
is
going
to
die
upon
the
gallows
;
and
if
he
is
*NL*
hanged
,
it
would
be
against
the
law
,
because
he
swore
the
truth
;
and
if
*NL*
they
do
not
hang
him
,
why
then
he
swore
a
lie
,
and
ought
to
have
*NL*
suffered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
just
as
you
say
,
my
lord
governor
,
''
said
the
messenger
,
``
and
*NL*
nothing
more
is
wanting
to
a
right
understanding
of
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
then
,
''
continued
Sancho
,
``
that
they
must
let
that
part
of
the
*NL*
man
pass
that
swore
the
truth
and
hang
that
part
that
swore
the
lie
,
and
*NL*
thereby
the
law
will
be
obeyed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
my
lord
,
''
replied
the
stranger
,
``
the
man
must
be
divided
into
*NL*
two
parts
;
and
thereby
he
will
certainly
die
,
and
thus
the
law
,
which
we
*NL*
are
bound
to
observe
,
is
in
no
respect
complied
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harkee
,
honest
man
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
either
I
have
no
brains
,
or
there
is
*NL*
as
much
reason
to
put
this
passenger
to
death
as
to
let
him
live
and
*NL*
pass
the
bridge
;
for
,
if
the
truth
saves
him
,
the
lie
also
condemns
him
,
*NL*
and
this
being
so
,
you
may
tell
those
gentlemen
who
sent
you
to
me
,
that
*NL*
since
the
reasons
for
condemning
and
acquitting
him
are
equal
,
they
*NL*
should
let
the
man
pass
freely
,
for
it
is
always
more
commendable
to
do
*NL*
good
than
to
do
harm

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
having
plentifully
dined
that
day
,
in
spite
of
all
the
aphorisms
*NL*
of
Dr.
Tirteafuera
,
when
the
cloth
was
removed
in
came
an
express
with
a
*NL*
letter
from
Don
Quixote
to
the
governor
.
Sancho
ordered
the
secretary
to
*NL*
read
it
to
himself
,
and
if
there
was
nothing
in
it
for
secret
perusal
,
*NL*
then
to
read
it
aloud
.
The
secretary
having
first
run
it
over
,
*NL*
accordingly
,
``
My
lord
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
letter
may
not
only
be
publicly
*NL*
read
,
but
deserves
to
be
engraved
in
characters
of
gold
;
and
thus
it
*NL*
is

*NL*
DON
QUIXOTE
DE
LA
MANCHA
TO
SANCHO
PANZA
,
GOVERNOR
OF
THE
ISLAND
OF
*NL*
BARATARIA
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
expected
to
have
had
an
account
of
thy
carelessness
and
*NL*
blunders
,
friend
Sancho
,
I
was
agreeably
disappointed
with
news
of
thy
*NL*
wise
behavior
,
--
for
which
I
return
thanks
to
Heaven
,
that
can
raise
the
*NL*
lowest
from
their
poverty
and
turn
the
fool
into
a
man
of
sense
.
I
hear
*NL*
thou
governest
with
all
discretion
;
and
that
,
nevertheless
,
thou
*NL*
retainest
the
humility
of
the
meanest
creature
.
But
I
would
observe
to
*NL*
thee
,
Sancho
,
that
it
is
often
expedient
and
necessary
,
for
the
due
*NL*
support
of
authority
,
to
act
in
contradiction
to
the
humility
of
the
*NL*
heart
.
The
personal
adornments
of
one
that
is
raised
to
a
high
situation
*NL*
must
correspond
with
his
present
greatness
,
and
not
with
his
former
*NL*
lowliness
.
Let
thy
apparel
,
therefore
,
be
good
and
becoming
;
for
the
*NL*
hedgestake
,
when
decorated
no
longer
,
appears
what
it
really
is
.
I
do
*NL*
not
mean
that
thou
shouldst
wear
jewels
or
finery
;
nor
,
being
a
judge
,
*NL*
would
I
have
thee
dress
like
a
soldier
;
but
adorn
thyself
in
a
manner
*NL*
suitable
to
thy
employment
.
To
gain
the
good-will
of
thy
people
,
two
*NL*
things
,
among
others
,
thou
must
not
fail
to
observe
:
one
is
,
to
be
*NL*
courteous
to
all
,
--
that
,
indeed
,
I
have
already
told
thee
;
the
other
is
,
*NL*
to
take
especial
care
that
the
people
be
exposed
to
no
scarcity
of
food
,
*NL*
for
,
with
the
poor
,
hunger
is
,
of
all
afflictions
,
the
most
*NL*
insupportable
.
Publish
few
edicts
,
but
let
those
be
good
;
and
,
above
*NL*
all
,
see
that
they
are
well
observed
,
for
edicts
that
are
not
kept
are
*NL*
the
same
as
not
made
,
and
serve
only
to
show
that
the
prince
,
though
he
*NL*
had
wisdom
and
authority
to
make
them
had
not
the
courage
to
insist
upon
*NL*
their
execution
.
Laws
that
threaten
and
are
not
enforced
become
like
*NL*
King
Log
,
whose
croaking
subjects
first
feared
,
then
despised
him
.
Be
a
*NL*
father
to
virtue
and
a
step-father
to
vice
.
Be
not
always
severe
,
nor
*NL*
always
mild
;
but
choose
the
happy
mean
between
them
,
which
is
the
true
*NL*
point
of
discretion
.
Visit
the
prisons
,
the
shambles
,
and
the
markets
;
*NL*
for
there
the
presence
of
the
governor
is
highly
necessary
.
Such
*NL*
attention
is
a
comfort
to
the
prisoner
hoping
for
release
;
it
is
a
*NL*
terror
to
the
butchers
,
who
then
dare
not
make
use
of
false
weights
;
and
*NL*
the
same
effect
is
produced
on
all
other
dealers
.
Shouldst
thou
*NL*
unhappily
be
secretly
inclined
to
avarice
,
to
gluttony
,
or
women
,
--
which
*NL*
I
hope
thou
art
not
,
--
avoid
showing
thyself
guilty
of
these
vices
;
for
,
*NL*
when
those
who
are
concerned
with
thee
discover
thy
ruling
passion
,
they
*NL*
will
assault
thee
on
that
quarter
,
nor
leave
thee
till
they
have
*NL*
effected
thy
destruction
.
View
and
review
,
consider
and
reconsider
,
the
*NL*
counsels
and
documents
I
gave
thee
in
writing
before
thy
departure
hence
*NL*
to
thy
government
,
and
in
them
thou
wilt
find
a
choice
supply
to
sustain
*NL*
thee
through
the
toils
and
difficulties
which
governors
must
continually
*NL*
encounter
.
Write
to
thy
patrons
,
the
duke
and
duchess
,
and
show
thyself
*NL*
grateful
,
for
ingratitude
is
the
daughter
of
pride
,
and
one
of
the
*NL*
greatest
sins
;
whereas
,
he
who
is
grateful
to
those
that
have
done
him
*NL*
service
,
thereby
testifies
that
he
will
be
grateful
also
to
God
,
his
*NL*
constant
benefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lady
duchess
has
despatched
a
messenger
to
thy
wife
Teresa
with
thy
*NL*
hunting-suit
,
and
also
a
present
from
herself
.
We
expect
an
answer
every
*NL*
moment
.
I
have
been
a
little
out
of
order
with
a
certain
cat-clawing
*NL*
which
befell
me

not
much

the
advantage
of
my
nose

but
it
was
*NL*
nothing

there

enchanters
who
persecute
me
,
there
are
others
*NL*
who
defend
me
.
Let
me
know

the
steward
who
is
with
thee
had
any
hand
*NL*
in
the
actions
of
the
Trifaldi

as
thou
hast
suspected
;
and
give
me
*NL*
advice
,
from
time
to
time
,
of
all
that
happens
to
thee
,
since
the
*NL*
distance
between
us
is
so
short
.
I
think
of
quitting
this
idle
life
very
*NL*
soon
,
for
I
was
not
born
for
luxury
and
ease
.
A
circumstance
has
*NL*
occurred
which
may
,
I

I

had
time
to
let
you

know
whether
it
goes
well

ill
with
me
in
this

government
,
where
*NL*
I
am
more
hunger-starved
than
when

and
I
wandered
through

``
My
lord
duke
wrote
to
me
the
other
day
to
inform
me
of
some
spies
that
*NL*
were
got
into
this
island
to
kill
me
;
but
as
yet
I
have
discovered
none
*NL*
but
a
certain
doctor
,
hired
by
the
islanders
to
kill
all
the
governors
*NL*
that
come
near
it
.
They
call
him
Dr.
Pedro
Rezio
de
Anguero
,
and
he
was
*NL*
born
at
Tirteafuera
.
His
name
is
enough
to
make
me
fear
he
will
be
the
*NL*
death
of
me
.
This
same
doctor
says
of
himself
,
that
he
does
cure
*NL*
diseases
when
you
have
them
;
but
when
you
have
them
not
,
he
only
*NL*
pretends
to
keep
them
from
coming
.
The
physic
he
uses
is
fasting
upon
*NL*
fasting
,
till
he
turns
a
body
to
a
mere
skeleton
;
as
if
to
be
wasted
to
*NL*
skin
and
bones
were
not
as
bad
as
a
fever
.
In
short
,
he
starves
me
to
*NL*
death
;
so
that
,
when
I
thought
,
as
being
a
governor
,
to
have
plenty
of
*NL*
good
hot
victuals
and
cool
liquor
,
and
to
repose
on
a
soft
feather-bed
,
*NL*
I
am
come
to
do
penance
like
a
hermit

I
have
not
yet
so
much
as
fingered
the

either

fees

anything
else
;
and
how
it
comes
to
be
no
better
with
me
I
can
not
*NL*
imagine
,
for
I
have
heard
that
the
governors
who
come
to
this
island
are
*NL*
wont
to
have
a
very
good
gift
,
or
at

a
very
round
sum
given
them
*NL*
by
the
town
before
they
enter

And
they

fell

intends

make
her

As
for

visit

yesterday
found
one

selling
hazel-nuts

She
pretended
they
were
all
new

I
*NL*
found
she
had
mixed
a
whole
bushel
of
old

empty

rotten
nuts
among
the
*NL*

quantity

new

With
that
I

know
how

pick

gave

the
widow

has
matched
her
*NL*
daughter
with
a
bungling
painter
,
who
came
here
and
undertook
all
sort
*NL*
of
work
.
The
corporation
employed
him
to
paint
the
king
's
arms
over
the
*NL*
gate
of
the
town-house
.
He
asked
them
two
ducats
for
the
job
,
which
they
*NL*
paid
beforehand
;
so
he
fell
to
it
and
worked
eight
days
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
which
he
had
made
nothing
of
it
,
and
said
he
could
not
bring
his
hand
to
*NL*
paint
such
trumpery
,
and
returned
the
money
;
yet
,
for
all
that
,
he
*NL*
married
in
the
name
of
a
good
workman
.
The
truth
is
,
he
has
left
his
*NL*
brushes
and
taken
up
the
spade
,
and
goes
to
the
field
like
a
gentleman
.
*NL*
Pedro
de
Lobo
's
son
has
taken
orders
and
shaved
his
crown

be

Minguilla
,
Mingo
Silvato
's
niece
,
hearing
of
it
,
is
suing
him

upon

promise
of
marriage

We

had
no
olives
this
year

nor
is

there
a
drop
of
vinegar
to
be
had
in
all
the
town

A
company
of
*NL*
foot-soldiers
passed
through
here
,
and
carried
off
with
them
three
*NL*
girls
.
I
will
not
say
who
they
are
;
mayhap
they
will
return
,
and
*NL*
somebody
or
other
marry
them
,
with
all
their
faults

Sanchica
makes
*NL*
bone-lace

gets
eight
maravedis

day

she
drops

to
help
her
toward
household
stuff
;
but
now
that
she
is
a
*NL*

daughter
,
she
has
no
need
to
work

for
thou
wilt
give
her
a

without
it

The
fountain

market-place

dried
up

I

And

*NL*
Liberty
is
one
of
the
most
precious
gifts
which
Heaven
hath
*NL*
bestowed
on
man
,
exceeding
all
the
treasures
which
earth
*NL*
encloses
,
or
which
ocean
hides
;
and
for
this
blessing
,
as
*NL*
well
as
for
honor
,
we
may
and
ought
to
venture
life
itself
.
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
captivity
and
restraint
are
the
greatest
*NL*
evils
that
human
nature
can
endure
.
I
make
this
observation
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
because
thou
hast
seen
the
delicacies
and
the
plenty
*NL*
with
which
we
were
entertained
in
that
castle
;
yet
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
those
savory
banquets
and
ice-cooled
potations
,
I
*NL*
thought
myself
confined
within
the
very
straits
of
famine
,
*NL*
because
I
did
not
enjoy
the
treat
with
that
liberty
which
I
*NL*
should
have
felt
had
it
been
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Obligations
incurred
by
benefits
and
favors
received
are
*NL*
fetters
which
hamper
the
free-born
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
is
he
to
whom
Heaven
hath
sent
a
morsel
of
bread
,
for
*NL*
which
he
is
obliged
to
none
but
Heaven
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
wisdom
must
be
old
*NL*
Who
knows
in
giving
where
to
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
times
are
not
the
same
,
nor
equally
fortunate
;
and
those
*NL*
incidents
which
the
vulgar
call
omens
,
though
not
founded
on
*NL*
any
natural
reason
,
have
,
even
by
persons
of
sagacity
,
been
*NL*
held
and
deemed
as
fair
and
fortunate
.
One
of
these
*NL*
superstitious
omen-mongers
rises
in
the
morning
,
goes
*NL*
abroad
,
chances
to
meet
a
friar
belonging
to
the
beatified
*NL*
St.
Francis
;
and
as
if
he
had
encountered
a
dragon
in
his
*NL*
way
,
runs
back
to
his
own
house
with
fear
and
consternation
.
*NL*
Another
Foresight
by
accident
scatters
the
salt
upon
the
*NL*
table
,
by
which
fear
and
melancholy
are
scattered
through
*NL*
his
heart
;
as
if
Nature
was
obliged
to
foretell
future
*NL*
misfortunes
by
such
trivial
signs
and
tokens
;
whereas
a
*NL*
prudent
man
and
a
good
Christian
will
not
so
minutely
*NL*
scrutinize
the
purposes
of
Heaven
.
Scipio
,
chancing
to
fall
*NL*
in
landing
upon
the
coast
of
Afric
,
and
perceiving
that
his
*NL*
soldiers
looked
upon
this
accident
as
a
bad
omen
,
he
*NL*
embraced
the
soil
with
seeming
eagerness
,
saying
,
``
Thou
*NL*
shalt
not
`
scape
me
,
Afric
,
for
I
have
thee
safe
in
my
*NL*
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Love
has
no
respect
of
persons
,
and
laughs
at
the
*NL*
admonitions
of
reason
;
like
Death
,
he
pursues
his
game
both
*NL*
in
the
stately
palaces
of
kings
and
the
humble
huts
of
*NL*
shepherds
.
When
he
has
got
a
soul
fairly
in
his
clutches
,
*NL*
his
first
business
is
to
deprive
it
of
all
shame
and
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beauty
,
they
say
,
is
the
chief
thing
in
love-matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hearken
to
me
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
there
are
two
kinds
of
*NL*
beauty
,
--
the
one
of
the
mind
,
the
other
of
the
body
.
That
of
the
mind
*NL*
shines
forth
in
good
sense
and
good
conduct
,
in
modesty
,
liberality
,
and
*NL*
courtesy
;
and
all
these
qualities
may
be
found
in
one
who
has
no
*NL*
personal
attractions
;
and
when
that
species
of
beauty
captivates
,
it
*NL*
produces
a
vehement
and
superior
passion
.
I
well
know
,
Sancho
,
that
I
am
*NL*
not
handsome
,
but
I
know
also
that
I
am
not
deformed
;
and
a
man
of
*NL*
worth
,
if
he
be
not
hideous
,
may
inspire
love
,
provided
he
has
those
*NL*
qualities
of
the
mind
which
I
have
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
sins
that
men
commit
,
though
some
say
pride
,
in
my
opinion
*NL*
ingratitude
is
the
worst
.
It
is
truly
said
that
hell
is
full
of
the
*NL*
ungrateful
.
From
that
foul
crime
I
have
endeavored
to
abstain
ever
since
*NL*
I
enjoyed
the
use
of
reason
;
and
if
I
can
not
return
the
good
offices
*NL*
done
me
by
equal
benefits
,
I
substitute
my
desire
to
repay
them
;
and
if
*NL*
this
be
not
enough
,
I
publish
them
:
for
he
who
proclaims
the
favors
he
*NL*
has
received
would
return
them
if
he
could
.
And
generally
the
power
of
*NL*
the
receiver
is
unequal
to
that
of
the
giver
,
like
the
bounty
of
Heaven
,
*NL*
to
which
no
man
can
make
an
equal
return
.
But
,
though
utterly
unable
to
*NL*
repay
the
unspeakable
beneficence
of
God
,
gratitude
affords
an
humble
*NL*
compensation
suited
to
our
limited
powers
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
I
dare

''
quoth
Don

,
``
that
you
are
scarcely

known
in

world

but
it
is
the
fate
of
all
ingenious
men

What
*NL*
abilities
are
lost
,
what
genius
obscured
,
and
what
talents
despised
!
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
I
can
not
but
think
that
translation
from
one
language
into
*NL*
another
,
unless
it
be
from
the
noblest
of
all
languages
,
Greek
and
*NL*
Latin
,
is
like
presenting
the
back
of
a
piece
of
tapestry
,
where
,
*NL*
though
the
figures
are
seen
,
they
are
obscured
by
innumerable
knots
and
*NL*
ends
of
thread
,
very
different
from
the
smooth
and
agreeable
texture
of
*NL*
the
proper
face
of
the
work
;
and
to
translate
easy
languages
of
a
*NL*
similar
construction
requires
no
more
talent
than
transcribing
one
paper
*NL*
from
another
.
But
I
would
not
hence
infer
that
translating
is
not
a
*NL*
laudable
exercise
;
for
a
man
may
be
worse
and
more
unprofitably

employed

Nor
can
my

to

felicity
,
have
*NL*
made
it
difficult
to

which
is
the
translation

is
the
*NL*
original
.
But
tell
me
,
signor
,

this
book

at
your
charge
,

you
sold
the

*NL*
``

saw
another

It
must
here
be
mentioned

Sancho
Panza

by
way
of
sumpter-cloth

*NL*
had
thrown
the
buckram
robe
painted

had
worn
on

clapped

on

never
was
an

so
honored

bedizened

immediately
recognizing

ran
toward
them
with
open

Don

alighted

embraced
them
cordially

said
Sancho
,
``
that
a
man

commit

*NL*

to
give

up

THE

*NL*
``
I

''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
death
advances
fast
upon

me
.
Let
us
then
be
serious
,
and
bring
me
a
confessor
,
and
a
notary
to
*NL*
draw
up
my
will
,
for
a
man
in
my
state

not
trifle
with
his

*NL*
Let
the

be
sent
for
,
I
beseech
you
,
while
my

here
,
the
*NL*
priest
,
is
taking
my

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
,
having
listened
to
his
dying
friend
's
confession
,
came
out
*NL*
of
the
room
and
told
them
that
the
good
Alonzo
Quixano
was
near
his
end
,
*NL*
and
certainly
in
his
right
senses
;
he
therefore
advised
them
to
go
in
,
*NL*
as
it
was
full
time
that
his
will
should
be
made
.
These
tidings
gave
a
*NL*
terrible
stab
to
the
overcharged
hearts
of
the
two
ladies
and
his
*NL*
faithful
squire
,
whose
eyes
overflowed
with
weeping
,
and
whose
bosoms
*NL*
had
well-nigh
burst
with
a
thousand
sighs
and
groans
;
for
,
indeed
,
it
*NL*
must
be
owned
,
as
we
have
somewhere
observed
,
that
whether
in
the
*NL*
character
of
Alonzo
Quixano
the
Good
,
or
in
the
capacity
of
Don
Quixote
*NL*
de
la
Mancha
,
the
poor
gentleman
had
always
exhibited
marks
of
a
*NL*
peaceable
temper
and
agreeable
demeanor
,
for
which
he
was
beloved
,
not
*NL*
only
by
his
own
family
,
but
also
by
all
those
who
had
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
his
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
notary
entering
the
apartment
with
the
rest
of
the
company
,
wrote
*NL*
the
preamble
of
the
will
,
in
which
Don
Quixote
disposed
of
his
soul
in
*NL*
all
the
necessary
Christian
forms
;
then
proceeding
to
the
legacies
,
he
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Item
:
whereas
,
Sancho
Panza
,

,
in
my
madness
,
I
made
my

has
*NL*
in

hands
a
certain
sum
of
money
for
my
use
;
and
,
as
divers
accounts
,
*NL*
disbursements
,
and
pecuniary
transactions
have
passed
between
us
,
it
is
*NL*
my
will
that
he
shall
not
be
charged
or
brought
to
account
for
the
said
*NL*
money
;
but
,
if
there
be
any
overplus
after
he
has
deducted
the
payment
*NL*
of
what
I
owe
him
,
the
said
overplus
,
which
must
be
a
mere
trifle
,
shall
*NL*
be
his

much
good
may
it
do
him
;
and
as
,
during
my
disorder
,
I
*NL*
contributed
to
his
being
made
governor
of
an
island

I
would
now
,

*NL*
I

my
perfect

confer
upon
him

it
in

a
whole

richly
deserves
for
the
innocency
of
his
heart

the
*NL*
fidelity
of
his
service

*NL*
*NL*
Then
turning
to
the
disconsolate
squire
,
``
Forgive
me

friend

''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
for
having
been

erroneous

*NL*
``
Gentlemen

it

*NL*
``
And
,
finally
,
I
beseech
the
said
gentlemen
,
my
executors

that
if
haply

they
should
come
to
the
knowledge

abroad
,
entitled
,
`
The
Second
Part

'
that
they

,
in

name
,
most
earnestly
*NL*
entreat
him
to
forgive
me
for
having
been
the
innocent
cause
of
his
*NL*
writing
such
a
number
of
absurdities
as
that
performance
contains
;
for
I
*NL*
quit
this
life
with
some
scruples
of
conscience
arising
from
that
*NL*
consideration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
will
being
thus
concluded
,
he
was
seized
with
a
fainting-fit
,
and
*NL*
stretched
himself
at
full
length
in
the
bed
,
so
that
all
the
company
*NL*
were
alarmed
and
ran
to
his
assistance
.
During
three
days
which
he
lived
*NL*
after
the
will
was
signed
and
sealed
,
he
frequently
fainted
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
family
was
in
confusion
.
Nevertheless
,
the
niece
ate
her
victuals
,
*NL*
the
housekeeper
drank
to
the
repose
of
his
soul
,
and
even
Sancho
*NL*
cherished
his
little
carcass
;
for
the
prospect
of
succession
either
*NL*
dispels
or
moderates
that
affliction
which
an
heir
ought
to
feel
at
the
*NL*
death
of
the
testator
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Don
Quixote
expired
,
after
having
received
all
the
sacraments
,
*NL*
and
in
the
strongest
terms
,
pathetically
enforced
,
expressed
his
*NL*
abomination
against
all
books
of
chivalry
;
and
the
notary
observed
,
that
*NL*
in
all
the
books
of
that
kind
which
he
had
perused
,
he
had
never
read
of
*NL*
any
knight-errant
who
died
quietly
in
his
bed
as
a
good
Christian
,
like
*NL*
Don
Quixote
;
who
,
amidst
the
tears
and
lamentations
of
all
present
,
gave
*NL*
up
the
ghost
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
departed
this
life
.
The
curate
was
no
*NL*
sooner
certified
of
his
decease
,
than
he
desired
the
notary
to
make
out
*NL*
a
testimonial
,
declaring
that
Alonzo
Quixano
the
Good
,
commonly
called
*NL*
Don
Quixote
de
la
Mancha
,
had
taken
his
departure
from
this
life
,
and
*NL*
died
of
a
natural
death
;
that
no
other
author
,
different
from
Cid
Hamet
*NL*
Benengeli
,
should
falsely
pretend
to
raise
him
from
the
dead
,
and
write
*NL*
endless
histories
of
his
achievements
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
end
of
that
extraordinary
gentleman
of
La
Mancha
,
whose
*NL*
birthplace
Cid
Hamet
was
careful
to
conceal
,
that
all
the
towns
and
*NL*
villages
of
that
province
might
contend
for
the
honor
of
having
produced
*NL*
him
,
as
did
the
seven
cities
of
Greece
for
the
glory
of
giving
birth
to
*NL*
Homer
.
The
lamentations
of
Sancho
,

niece
and
the
housekeeper

composed

Sampson
Carrasco

Here
lies

valiant
cavalier

*NL*
Who
never
had
a
sense
of
fear
:
*NL*
So
high
his
matchless
courage
rose
,
*NL*
He
reckoned
death
among
his
vanquished
foes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wrongs
to
redress
,
his
sword
he
drew
,
*NL*
And
many
a
caitiff
giant
slew
;
*NL*
His
days
of
life
though
madness
stained
,
*NL*
In
death
his
sober
senses
he
regained
