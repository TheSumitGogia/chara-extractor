*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
TRANSLATOR
'S
PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
:
ABOUT
THIS
TRANSLATION
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
considerable
reluctance
that
I
abandoned
in
favour
of
the
*NL*
present
undertaking
what
had
long
been
a
favourite
project
:
that
of
a
new
*NL*
edition
of
Shelton
's
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
which
has
now
become
a
somewhat
*NL*
scarce
book
.
There
are
some
--
and
I
confess
myself
to
be
one
--
for
whom
*NL*
Shelton
's
racy
old
version
,
with
all
its
defects
,
has
a
charm
that
no
*NL*
modern
translation
,
however
skilful
or
correct
,
could
possess
.
Shelton
*NL*
had
the
inestimable
advantage
of
belonging
to
the
same
generation
as
*NL*
Cervantes
;
``
Don
Quixote
''
had
to
him
a
vitality
that
only
a
contemporary
*NL*
could
feel
;
it
cost
him
no
dramatic
effort
to
see
things
as
Cervantes
saw
*NL*
them
;
there
is
no
anachronism
in
his
language
;
he
put
the
Spanish
of
*NL*
Cervantes
into
the
English
of
Shakespeare
.
Shakespeare
himself
most
*NL*
likely
knew
the
book
;
he
may
have
carried
it
home
with
him
in
his
*NL*
saddle-bags
to
Stratford
on
one
of
his
last
journeys
,
and
under
the
*NL*
mulberry
tree
at
New
Place
joined
hands
with
a
kindred
genius
in
its
*NL*
pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
soon
made
plain
to
me
that
to
hope
for
even
a
moderate
*NL*
popularity
for
Shelton
was
vain
.
His
fine
old
crusted
English
would
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
be
relished
by
a
minority
,
but
it
would
be
only
by
a
minority
.
His
*NL*
warmest
admirers
must
admit
that
he
is
not
a
satisfactory
representative
*NL*
of
Cervantes
.
His
translation
of
the
First
Part
was
very
hastily
made
and
*NL*
was
never
revised
by
him
.
It
has
all
the
freshness
and
vigour
,
but
also
a
*NL*
full
measure
of
the
faults
,
of
a
hasty
production
.
It
is
often
very
*NL*
literal
--
barbarously
literal
frequently
--
but
just
as
often
very
loose
.
He
*NL*
had
evidently
a
good
colloquial
knowledge
of
Spanish
,
but
apparently
not
*NL*
much
more
.
It
never
seems
to
occur
to
him
that
the
same
translation
of
a
*NL*
word
will
not
suit
in
every
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
often
said
that
we
have
no
satisfactory
translation
of
``
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
''
To
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
original
,
it
savours
of
*NL*
truism
or
platitude
to
say
so
,
for
in
truth
there
can
be
no
thoroughly
*NL*
satisfactory
translation
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
into
English
or
any
other
*NL*
language
.
It
is
not
that
the
Spanish
idioms
are
so
utterly
unmanageable
,
*NL*
or
that
the
untranslatable
words
,
numerous
enough
no
doubt
,
are
so
*NL*
superabundant
,
but
rather
that
the
sententious
terseness
to
which
the
*NL*
humour
of
the
book
owes
its
flavour
is
peculiar
to
Spanish
,
and
can
at
*NL*
best
be
only
distantly
imitated
in
any
other
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
of
our
English
translations
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
is
instructive
.
*NL*
Shelton
's
,
the
first
in
any
language
,
was
made
,
apparently
,
about
1608
,
*NL*
but
not
published
till
1612
.
This
of
course
was
only
the
First
Part
.
It
*NL*
has
been
asserted
that
the
Second
,
published
in
1620
,
is
not
the
work
of
*NL*
Shelton
,
but
there
is
nothing
to
support
the
assertion
save
the
fact
that
*NL*
it
has
less
spirit
,
less
of
what
we
generally
understand
by
``
go
,
''
about
*NL*
it
than
the
first
,
which
would
be
only
natural
if
the
first
were
the
work
*NL*
of
a
young
man
writing
currente
calamo
,
and
the
second
that
of
a
*NL*
middle-aged
man
writing
for
a
bookseller
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
closer
*NL*
and
more
literal
,
the
style
is
the
same
,
the
very
same
translations
,
or
*NL*
mistranslations
,
occur
in
it
,
and
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
a
new
*NL*
translator
would
,
by
suppressing
his
name
,
have
allowed
Shelton
to
carry
*NL*
off
the
credit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1687
John
Phillips
,
Milton
's
nephew
,
produced
a
``
Don
Quixote
''
``
made
*NL*
English
,
''
he
says
,
``
according
to
the
humour
of
our
modern
language
.
''
His
*NL*
``
Quixote
''
is
not
so
much
a
translation
as
a
travesty
,
and
a
travesty
that
*NL*
for
coarseness
,
vulgarity
,
and
buffoonery
is
almost
unexampled
even
in
*NL*
the
literature
of
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ned
Ward
's
``
Life
and
Notable
Adventures
of
Don
Quixote
,
merrily
*NL*
translated
into
Hudibrastic
Verse
''
-LRB-
1700
-RRB-
,
can
scarcely
be
reckoned
a
*NL*
translation
,
but
it
serves
to
show
the
light
in
which
``
Don
Quixote
''
was
*NL*
regarded
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
further
illustration
may
be
found
in
the
version
published
in
1712
by
*NL*
Peter
Motteux
,
who
had
then
recently
combined
tea-dealing
with
*NL*
literature
.
It
is
described
as
``
translated
from
the
original
by
several
*NL*
hands
,
''
but
if
so
all
Spanish
flavour
has
entirely
evaporated
under
the
*NL*
manipulation
of
the
several
hands
.
The
flavour
that
it
has
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
is
distinctly
Franco-cockney
.
Anyone
who
compares
it
carefully
with
*NL*
the
original
will
have
little
doubt
that
it
is
a
concoction
from
Shelton
*NL*
and
the
French
of
Filleau
de
Saint
Martin
,
eked
out
by
borrowings
from
*NL*
Phillips
,
whose
mode
of
treatment
it
adopts
.
It
is
,
to
be
sure
,
more
*NL*
decent
and
decorous
,
but
it
treats
``
Don
Quixote
''
in
the
same
fashion
as
a
*NL*
comic
book
that
can
not
be
made
too
comic
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
attempt
to
improve
the
humour
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
by
an
infusion
of
*NL*
cockney
flippancy
and
facetiousness
,
as
Motteux
's
operators
did
,
is
not
*NL*
merely
an
impertinence
like
larding
a
sirloin
of
prize
beef
,
but
an
*NL*
absolute
falsification
of
the
spirit
of
the
book
,
and
it
is
a
proof
of
*NL*
the
uncritical
way
in
which
``
Don
Quixote
''
is
generally
read
that
this
*NL*
worse
than
worthless
translation
--
worthless
as
failing
to
represent
,
*NL*
worse
than
worthless
as
misrepresenting
--
should
have
been
favoured
as
it
*NL*
has
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
the
effect
,
however
,
of
bringing
out
a
translation
undertaken
and
*NL*
executed
in
a
very
different
spirit
,
that
of
Charles
Jervas
,
the
portrait
*NL*
painter
,
and
friend
of
Pope
,
Swift
,
Arbuthnot
,
and
Gay
.
Jervas
has
been
*NL*
allowed
little
credit
for
his
work
,
indeed
it
may
be
said
none
,
for
it
is
*NL*
known
to
the
world
in
general
as
Jarvis
's
.
It
was
not
published
until
*NL*
after
his
death
,
and
the
printers
gave
the
name
according
to
the
current
*NL*
pronunciation
of
the
day
.
It
has
been
the
most
freely
used
and
the
most
*NL*
freely
abused
of
all
the
translations
.
It
has
seen
far
more
editions
than
*NL*
any
other
,
it
is
admitted
on
all
hands
to
be
by
far
the
most
faithful
,
*NL*
and
yet
nobody
seems
to
have
a
good
word
to
say
for
it
or
for
its
author
.
*NL*
Jervas
no
doubt
prejudiced
readers
against
himself
in
his
preface
,
where
*NL*
among
many
true
words
about
Shelton
,
Stevens
,
and
Motteux
,
he
rashly
and
*NL*
unjustly
charges
Shelton
with
having
translated
not
from
the
Spanish
,
but
*NL*
from
the
Italian
version
of
Franciosini
,
which
did
not
appear
until
ten
*NL*
years
after
Shelton
's
first
volume
.
A
suspicion
of
incompetence
,
too
,
*NL*
seems
to
have
attached
to
him
because
he
was
by
profession
a
painter
and
*NL*
a
mediocre
one
-LRB-
though
he
has
given
us
the
best
portrait
we
have
of
*NL*
Swift
-RRB-
,
and
this
may
have
been
strengthened
by
Pope
's
remark
that
he
*NL*
``
translated
`
Don
Quixote
'
without
understanding
Spanish
.
''
He
has
been
*NL*
also
charged
with
borrowing
from
Shelton
,
whom
he
disparaged
.
It
is
true
*NL*
that
in
a
few
difficult
or
obscure
passages
he
has
followed
Shelton
,
and
*NL*
gone
astray
with
him
;
but
for
one
case
of
this
sort
,
there
are
fifty
*NL*
where
he
is
right
and
Shelton
wrong
.
As
for
Pope
's
dictum
,
anyone
who
*NL*
examines
Jervas
's
version
carefully
,
side
by
side
with
the
original
,
will
*NL*
see
that
he
was
a
sound
Spanish
scholar
,
incomparably
a
better
one
than
*NL*
Shelton
,
except
perhaps
in
mere
colloquial
Spanish
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
an
*NL*
honest
,
faithful
,
and
painstaking
translator
,
and
he
has
left
a
version
*NL*
which
,
whatever
its
shortcomings
may
be
,
is
singularly
free
from
errors
*NL*
and
mistranslations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
charge
against
it
is
that
it
is
stiff
,
dry
--
``
wooden
''
in
a
word,-and
*NL*
no
one
can
deny
that
there
is
a
foundation
for
it
.
But
it
may
be
pleaded
*NL*
for
Jervas
that
a
good
deal
of
this
rigidity
is
due
to
his
abhorrence
of
*NL*
the
light
,
flippant
,
jocose
style
of
his
predecessors
.
He
was
one
of
the
*NL*
few
,
very
few
,
translators
that
have
shown
any
apprehension
of
the
*NL*
unsmiling
gravity
which
is
the
essence
of
Quixotic
humour
;
it
seemed
to
*NL*
him
a
crime
to
bring
Cervantes
forward
smirking
and
grinning
at
his
own
*NL*
good
things
,
and
to
this
may
be
attributed
in
a
great
measure
the
ascetic
*NL*
abstinence
from
everything
savouring
of
liveliness
which
is
the
*NL*
characteristic
of
his
translation
.
In
most
modern
editions
,
it
should
be
*NL*
observed
,
his
style
has
been
smoothed
and
smartened
,
but
without
any
*NL*
reference
to
the
original
Spanish
,
so
that
if
he
has
been
made
to
read
*NL*
more
agreeably
he
has
also
been
robbed
of
his
chief
merit
of
fidelity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smollett
's
version
,
published
in
1755
,
may
be
almost
counted
as
one
of
*NL*
these
.
At
any
rate
it
is
plain
that
in
its
construction
Jervas
's
*NL*
translation
was
very
freely
drawn
upon
,
and
very
little
or
probably
no
*NL*
heed
given
to
the
original
Spanish
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
later
translations
may
be
dismissed
in
a
few
words
.
George
Kelly
's
,
*NL*
which
appeared
in
1769
,
``
printed
for
the
Translator
,
''
was
an
impudent
*NL*
imposture
,
being
nothing
more
than
Motteux
's
version
with
a
few
of
the
*NL*
words
,
here
and
there
,
artfully
transposed
;
Charles
Wilmot
's
-LRB-
1774
-RRB-
was
*NL*
only
an
abridgment
like
Florian
's
,
but
not
so
skilfully
executed
;
and
the
*NL*
version
published
by
Miss
Smirke
in
1818
,
to
accompany
her
brother
's
*NL*
plates
,
was
merely
a
patchwork
production
made
out
of
former
*NL*
translations
.
On
the
latest
,
Mr.
A.
J.
Duffield
's
,
it
would
be
in
every
*NL*
sense
of
the
word
impertinent
in
me
to
offer
an
opinion
here
.
I
had
not
*NL*
even
seen
it
when
the
present
undertaking
was
proposed
to
me
,
and
since
*NL*
then
I
may
say
vidi
tantum
,
having
for
obvious
reasons
resisted
the
*NL*
temptation
which
Mr.
Duffield
's
reputation
and
comely
volumes
hold
out
to
*NL*
every
lover
of
Cervantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
foregoing
history
of
our
translations
of
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
it
will
*NL*
be
seen
that
there
are
a
good
many
people
who
,
provided
they
get
the
mere
*NL*
narrative
with
its
full
complement
of
facts
,
incidents
,
and
adventures
*NL*
served
up
to
them
in
a
form
that
amuses
them
,
care
very
little
whether
*NL*
that
form
is
the
one
in
which
Cervantes
originally
shaped
his
ideas
.
On
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
it
is
clear
that
there
are
many
who
desire
to
have
not
*NL*
merely
the
story
he
tells
,
but
the
story
as
he
tells
it
,
so
far
at
least
*NL*
as
differences
of
idiom
and
circumstances
permit
,
and
who
will
give
a
*NL*
preference
to
the
conscientious
translator
,
even
though
he
may
have
*NL*
acquitted
himself
somewhat
awkwardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
all
there
is
no
real
antagonism
between
the
two
classes
;
there
*NL*
is
no
reason
why
what
pleases
the
one
should
not
please
the
other
,
or
why
*NL*
a
translator
who
makes
it
his
aim
to
treat
``
Don
Quixote
''
with
the
respect
*NL*
due
to
a
great
classic
,
should
not
be
as
acceptable
even
to
the
careless
*NL*
reader
as
the
one
who
treats
it
as
a
famous
old
jest-book
.
It
is
not
a
*NL*
question
of
caviare
to
the
general
,
or
,
if
it
is
,
the
fault
rests
with
*NL*
him
who
makes
so
.
The
method
by
which
Cervantes
won
the
ear
of
the
*NL*
Spanish
people
ought
,
mutatis
mutandis
,
to
be
equally
effective
with
the
*NL*
great
majority
of
English
readers
.
At
any
rate
,
even
if
there
are
readers
*NL*
to
whom
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
,
fidelity
to
the
method
is
as
much
*NL*
a
part
of
the
translator
's
duty
as
fidelity
to
the
matter
.
If
he
can
*NL*
please
all
parties
,
so
much
the
better
;
but
his
first
duty
is
to
those
*NL*
who
look
to
him
for
as
faithful
a
representation
of
his
author
as
it
is
*NL*
in
his
power
to
give
them
,
faithful
to
the
letter
so
long
as
fidelity
is
*NL*
practicable
,
faithful
to
the
spirit
so
far
as
he
can
make
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
purpose
here
is
not
to
dogmatise
on
the
rules
of
translation
,
but
to
*NL*
indicate
those
I
have
followed
,
or
at
least
tried
to
the
best
of
my
*NL*
ability
to
follow
,
in
the
present
instance
.
One
which
,
it
seems
to
me
,
*NL*
can
not
be
too
rigidly
followed
in
translating
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
is
to
avoid
*NL*
everything
that
savours
of
affectation
.
The
book
itself
is
,
indeed
,
in
*NL*
one
sense
a
protest
against
it
,
and
no
man
abhorred
it
more
than
*NL*
Cervantes
.
For
this
reason
,
I
think
,
any
temptation
to
use
antiquated
or
*NL*
obsolete
language
should
be
resisted
.
It
is
after
all
an
affectation
,
and
*NL*
one
for
which
there
is
no
warrant
or
excuse
.
Spanish
has
probably
*NL*
undergone
less
change
since
the
seventeenth
century
than
any
language
in
*NL*
Europe
,
and
by
far
the
greater
and
certainly
the
best
part
of
``
Don
*NL*
Quixote
''
differs
but
little
in
language
from
the
colloquial
Spanish
of
*NL*
the
present
day
.
Except
in
the
tales
and
Don
Quixote
's
speeches
,
the
*NL*
translator
who
uses
the
simplest
and
plainest
everyday
language
will
*NL*
almost
always
be
the
one
who
approaches
nearest
to
the
original
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
the
story
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
and
all
its
characters
and
*NL*
incidents
have
now
been
for
more
than
two
centuries
and
a
half
familiar
*NL*
as
household
words
in
English
mouths
,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
old
*NL*
familiar
names
and
phrases
should
not
be
changed
without
good
reason
.
Of
*NL*
course
a
translator
who
holds
that
``
Don
Quixote
''
should
receive
the
*NL*
treatment
a
great
classic
deserves
,
will
feel
himself
bound
by
the
*NL*
injunction
laid
upon
the
Morisco
in
Chap
.
IX
not
to
omit
or
add
anything
.

*NL*
II
:
ABOUT
CERVANTES
AND
DON
QUIXOTE
*NL*
*NL*
Four
generations
had
laughed
over
``
Don
Quixote
''
before
it
occurred
to
*NL*
anyone
to
ask
,
who
and
what
manner
of
man
was
this
Miguel
de
Cervantes
*NL*
Saavedra
whose
name
is
on
the
title-page
;
and
it
was
too
late
for
a
*NL*
satisfactory
answer
to
the
question
when
it
was
proposed
to
add
a
life
of
*NL*
the
author
to
the
London
edition
published
at
Lord
Carteret
's
instance
in
*NL*
1738
.
All
traces
of
the
personality
of
Cervantes
had
by
that
time
*NL*
disappeared
.
Any
floating
traditions
that
may
once
have
existed
,
*NL*
transmitted
from
men
who
had
known
him
,
had
long
since
died
out
,
and
of
*NL*
other
record
there
was
none
;
for
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
*NL*
were
incurious
as
to
``
the
men
of
the
time
,
''
a
reproach
against
which
the
*NL*
nineteenth
has
,
at
any
rate
,
secured
itself
,
if
it
has
produced
no
*NL*
Shakespeare
or
Cervantes
.
All
that
Mayans
y
Siscar
,
to
whom
the
task
was
*NL*
entrusted
,
or
any
of
those
who
followed
him
,
Rios
,
Pellicer
,
or
*NL*
Navarrete
,
could
do
was
to
eke
out
the
few
allusions
Cervantes
makes
to
*NL*
himself
in
his
various
prefaces
with
such
pieces
of
documentary
evidence
*NL*
bearing
upon
his
life
as
they
could
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
however
,
has
been
done
by
the
last-named
biographer
to
such
good
*NL*
purpose
that
he
has
superseded
all
predecessors
.
Thoroughness
is
the
*NL*
chief
characteristic
of
Navarrete
's
work
.
Besides
sifting
,
testing
,
and
*NL*
methodising
with
rare
patience
and
judgment
what
had
been
previously
*NL*
brought
to
light
,
he
left
,
as
the
saying
is
,
no
stone
unturned
under
*NL*
which
anything
to
illustrate
his
subject
might
possibly
be
found
.
*NL*
Navarrete
has
done
all
that
industry
and
acumen
could
do
,
and
it
is
no
*NL*
fault
of
his
if
he
has
not
given
us
what
we
want
.
What
Hallam
says
of
*NL*
Shakespeare
may
be
applied
to
the
almost
parallel
case
of
Cervantes
:
``
It
*NL*
is
not
the
register
of
his
baptism
,
or
the
draft
of
his
will
,
or
the
*NL*
orthography
of
his
name
that
we
seek
;
no
letter
of
his
writing
,
no
record
*NL*
of
his
conversation
,
no
character
of
him
drawn
...
by
a
contemporary
has
*NL*
been
produced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
only
natural
,
therefore
,
that
the
biographers
of
Cervantes
,
forced
*NL*
to
make
brick
without
straw
,
should
have
recourse
largely
to
conjecture
,
*NL*
and
that
conjecture
should
in
some
instances
come
by
degrees
to
take
the
*NL*
place
of
established
fact
.
All
that
I
propose
to
do
here
is
to
separate
*NL*
what
is
matter
of
fact
from
what
is
matter
of
conjecture
,
and
leave
it
to
*NL*
the
reader
's
judgment
to
decide
whether
the
data
justify
the
inference
or
*NL*
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
whose
names
by
common
consent
stand
in
the
front
rank
of
Spanish
*NL*
literature
,
Cervantes
,
Lope
de
Vega
,
Quevedo
,
Calderon
,
Garcilaso
de
la
*NL*
Vega
,
the
Mendozas
,
Gongora
,
were
all
men
of
ancient
families
,
and
,
*NL*
curiously
,
all
,
except
the
last
,
of
families
that
traced
their
origin
to
*NL*
the
same
mountain
district
in
the
North
of
Spain
.
The
family
of
Cervantes
*NL*
is
commonly
said
to
have
been
of
Galician
origin
,
and
unquestionably
it
*NL*
was
in
possession
of
lands
in
Galicia
at
a
very
early
date
;
but
I
think
*NL*
the
balance
of
the
evidence
tends
to
show
that
the
``
solar
,
''
the
original
*NL*
site
of
the
family
,
was
at
Cervatos
in
the
north-west
corner
of
Old
*NL*
Castile
,
close
to
the
junction
of
Castile
,
Leon
,
and
the
Asturias
.
As
it
*NL*
happens
,
there
is
a
complete
history
of
the
Cervantes
family
from
the
*NL*
tenth
century
down
to
the
seventeenth
extant
under
the
title
of
*NL*
``
Illustrious
Ancestry
,
Glorious
Deeds
,
and
Noble
Posterity
of
the
Famous
*NL*
Nuno
Alfonso
,
Alcaide
of
Toledo
,
''
written
in
1648
by
the
industrious
*NL*
genealogist
Rodrigo
Mendez
Silva
,
who
availed
himself
of
a
manuscript
*NL*
genealogy
by
Juan
de
Mena
,
the
poet
laureate
and
historiographer
of
John
*NL*
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
origin
of
the
name
Cervantes
is
curious
.
Nuno
Alfonso
was
almost
as
*NL*
distinguished
in
the
struggle
against
the
Moors
in
the
reign
of
Alfonso
*NL*
VII
as
the
Cid
had
been
half
a
century
before
in
that
of
Alfonso
VI
,
and
*NL*
was
rewarded
by
divers
grants
of
land
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Toledo
.
On
*NL*
one
of
his
acquisitions
,
about
two
leagues
from
the
city
,
he
built
*NL*
himself
a
castle
which
he
called
Cervatos
,
because
``
he
was
lord
of
the
*NL*
solar
of
Cervatos
in
the
Montana
,
''
as
the
mountain
region
extending
from
*NL*
the
Basque
Provinces
to
Leon
was
always
called
.
At
his
death
in
battle
in
*NL*
1143
,
the
castle
passed
by
his
will
to
his
son
Alfonso
Munio
,
who
,
as
*NL*
territorial
or
local
surnames
were
then
coming
into
vogue
in
place
of
the
*NL*
simple
patronymic
,
took
the
additional
name
of
Cervatos
.
His
eldest
son
*NL*
Pedro
succeeded
him
in
the
possession
of
the
castle
,
and
followed
his
*NL*
example
in
adopting
the
name
,
an
assumption
at
which
the
younger
son
,
*NL*
Gonzalo
,
seems
to
have
taken
umbrage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
who
has
paid
even
a
flying
visit
to
Toledo
will
remember
the
*NL*
ruined
castle
that
crowns
the
hill
above
the
spot
where
the
bridge
of
*NL*
Alcantara
spans
the
gorge
of
the
Tagus
,
and
with
its
broken
outline
and
*NL*
crumbling
walls
makes
such
an
admirable
pendant
to
the
square
solid
*NL*
Alcazar
towering
over
the
city
roofs
on
the
opposite
side
.
It
was
built
,
*NL*
or
as
some
say
restored
,
by
Alfonso
VI
shortly
after
his
occupation
of
*NL*
Toledo
in
1085
,
and
called
by
him
San
Servando
after
a
Spanish
martyr
,
a
*NL*
name
subsequently
modified
into
San
Servan
-LRB-
in
which
form
it
appears
in
*NL*
the
``
Poem
of
the
Cid
''
-RRB-
,
San
Servantes
,
and
San
Cervantes
:
with
regard
to
*NL*
which
last
the
``
Handbook
for
Spain
''
warns
its
readers
against
the
*NL*
supposition
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
author
of
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
*NL*
Ford
,
as
all
know
who
have
taken
him
for
a
companion
and
counsellor
on
*NL*
the
roads
of
Spain
,
is
seldom
wrong
in
matters
of
literature
or
history
.
*NL*
In
this
instance
,
however
,
he
is
in
error
.
It
has
everything
to
do
with
*NL*
the
author
of
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
for
it
is
in
fact
these
old
walls
that
have
*NL*
given
to
Spain
the
name
she
is
proudest
of
to-day
.
Gonzalo
,
above
*NL*
mentioned
,
it
may
be
readily
conceived
,
did
not
relish
the
appropriation
*NL*
by
his
brother
of
a
name
to
which
he
himself
had
an
equal
right
,
for
*NL*
though
nominally
taken
from
the
castle
,
it
was
in
reality
derived
from
*NL*
the
ancient
territorial
possession
of
the
family
,
and
as
a
set-off
,
and
*NL*
to
distinguish
himself
-LRB-
diferenciarse
-RRB-
from
his
brother
,
he
took
as
a
*NL*
surname
the
name
of
the
castle
on
the
bank
of
the
Tagus
,
in
the
building
*NL*
of
which
,
according
to
a
family
tradition
,
his
great-grandfather
had
a
*NL*
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
brothers
founded
families
.
The
Cervantes
branch
had
more
tenacity
;
*NL*
it
sent
offshoots
in
various
directions
,
Andalusia
,
Estremadura
,
Galicia
,
*NL*
and
Portugal
,
and
produced
a
goodly
line
of
men
distinguished
in
the
*NL*
service
of
Church
and
State
.
Gonzalo
himself
,
and
apparently
a
son
of
*NL*
his
,
followed
Ferdinand
III
in
the
great
campaign
of
1236-48
that
gave
*NL*
Cordova
and
Seville
to
Christian
Spain
and
penned
up
the
Moors
in
the
*NL*
kingdom
of
Granada
,
and
his
descendants
intermarried
with
some
of
the
*NL*
noblest
families
of
the
Peninsula
and
numbered
among
them
soldiers
,
*NL*
magistrates
,
and
Church
dignitaries
,
including
at
least
two
*NL*
cardinal-archbishops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
line
that
settled
in
Andalusia
,
Deigo
de
Cervantes
,
Commander
of
*NL*
the
Order
of
Santiago
,
married
Juana
Avellaneda
,
daughter
of
Juan
Arias
*NL*
de
Saavedra
,
and
had
several
sons
,
of
whom
one
was
Gonzalo
Gomez
,
*NL*
Corregidor
of
Jerez
and
ancestor
of
the
Mexican
and
Columbian
branches
of
*NL*
the
family
;
and
another
,
Juan
,
whose
son
Rodrigo
married
Dona
Leonor
de
*NL*
Cortinas
,
and
by
her
had
four
children

*NL*
The
pedigree
of
Cervantes
is
not
without
its
bearing
on
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
A
*NL*
man
who
could
look
back
upon
an
ancestry
of
genuine
knights-errant
*NL*
extending
from
well-nigh
the
time
of
Pelayo
to
the
siege
of
Granada
was
*NL*
likely
to
have
a
strong
feeling
on
the
subject
of
the
sham
chivalry
of
*NL*
the
romances
.
It
gives
a
point
,
too
,
to
what
he
says
in
more
than
one
*NL*
place
about
families
that
have
once
been
great
and
have
tapered
away
*NL*
until
they
have
come
to
nothing
,
like
a
pyramid
.
It
was
the
case
of
his
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
born
at
Alcala
de
Henares
and
baptised
in
the
church
of
Santa
*NL*
Maria
Mayor
on
the
9th
of
October
,
1547
.
Of
his
boyhood
and
youth
we
know
*NL*
nothing
,
unless
it
be
from
the
glimpse
he
gives
us
in
the
preface
to
his
*NL*
``
Comedies
''
of
himself
as
a
boy
looking
on
with
delight
while
Lope
de
*NL*
Rueda
and
his
company
set
up
their
rude
plank
stage
in
the
plaza
and
*NL*
acted
the
rustic
farces
which
he
himself
afterwards
took
as
the
model
of
*NL*
his
interludes
.
This
first
glimpse
,
however
,
is
a
significant
one
,
for
it
*NL*
shows
the
early
development
of
that
love
of
the
drama
which
exercised
*NL*
such
an
influence
on
his
life
and
seems
to
have
grown
stronger
as
he
grew
*NL*
older
,
and
of
which
this
very
preface
,
written
only
a
few
months
before
*NL*
his
death
,
is
such
a
striking
proof
.
He
gives
us
to
understand
,
too
,
that
*NL*
he
was
a
great
reader
in
his
youth
;
but
of
this
no
assurance
was
needed
,
*NL*
for
the
First
Part
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
alone
proves
a
vast
amount
of
*NL*
miscellaneous
reading
,
romances
of
chivalry
,
ballads
,
popular
poetry
,
*NL*
chronicles
,
for
which
he
had
no
time
or
opportunity
except
in
the
first
*NL*
twenty
years
of
his
life
;
and
his
misquotations
and
mistakes
in
matters
*NL*
of
detail
are
always
,
it
may
be
noticed
,
those
of
a
man
recalling
the
*NL*
reading
of
his
boyhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
things
besides
the
drama
were
in
their
infancy
when
Cervantes
was
a
*NL*
boy
.
The
period
of
his
boyhood
was
in
every
way
a
transition
period
for
*NL*
Spain
.
The
old
chivalrous
Spain
had
passed
away
.
The
new
Spain
was
the
*NL*
mightiest
power
the
world
had
seen
since
the
Roman
Empire
and
it
had
not
*NL*
yet
been
called
upon
to
pay
the
price
of
its
greatness
.
By
the
policy
of
*NL*
Ferdinand
and
Ximenez
the
sovereign
had
been
made
absolute
,
and
the
*NL*
Church
and
Inquisition
adroitly
adjusted
to
keep
him
so
.
The
nobles
,
who
*NL*
had
always
resisted
absolutism
as
strenuously
as
they
had
fought
the
*NL*
Moors
,
had
been
divested
of
all
political
power
,
a
like
fate
had
befallen
*NL*
the
cities
,
the
free
constitutions
of
Castile
and
Aragon
had
been
swept
*NL*
away
,
and
the
only
function
that
remained
to
the
Cortes
was
that
of
*NL*
granting
money
at
the
King
's
dictation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
transition
extended
to
literature
.
Men
who
,
like
Garcilaso
de
la
Vega
*NL*
and
Diego
Hurtado
de
Mendoza
,
followed
the
Italian
wars
,
had
brought
back
*NL*
from
Italy
the
products
of
the
post-Renaissance
literature
,
which
took
*NL*
root
and
flourished
and
even
threatened
to
extinguish
the
native
growths
.
*NL*
Damon
and
Thyrsis
,
Phyllis
and
Chloe
had
been
fairly
naturalised
in
*NL*
Spain
,
together
with
all
the
devices
of
pastoral
poetry
for
investing
*NL*
with
an
air
of
novelty
the
idea
of
a
dispairing
shepherd
and
inflexible
*NL*
shepherdess
.
As
a
set-off
against
this
,
the
old
historical
and
*NL*
traditional
ballads
,
and
the
true
pastorals
,
the
songs
and
ballads
of
*NL*
peasant
life
,
were
being
collected
assiduously
and
printed
in
the
*NL*
cancioneros
that
succeeded
one
another
with
increasing
rapidity
.
But
the
*NL*
most
notable
consequence
,
perhaps
,
of
the
spread
of
printing
was
the
*NL*
flood
of
romances
of
chivalry
that
had
continued
to
pour
from
the
press
*NL*
ever
since
Garci
Ordonez
de
Montalvo
had
resuscitated
``
Amadis
of
Gaul
''
at
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
youth
fond
of
reading
,
solid
or
light
,
there
could
have
been
no
*NL*
better
spot
in
Spain
than
Alcala
de
Henares
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
sixteenth
century
.
It
was
then
a
busy
,
populous
university
town
,
*NL*
something
more
than
the
enterprising
rival
of
Salamanca
,
and
altogether
a
*NL*
very
different
place
from
the
melancholy
,
silent
,
deserted
Alcala
the
*NL*
traveller
sees
now
as
he
goes
from
Madrid
to
Saragossa
.
Theology
and
*NL*
medicine
may
have
been
the
strong
points
of
the
university
,
but
the
town
*NL*
itself
seems
to
have
inclined
rather
to
the
humanities
and
light
*NL*
literature
,
and
as
a
producer
of
books
Alcala
was
already
beginning
to
*NL*
compete
with
the
older
presses
of
Toledo
,
Burgos
,
Salamanca
and
Seville
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pendant
to
the
picture
Cervantes
has
given
us
of
his
first
playgoings
*NL*
might
,
no
doubt
,
have
been
often
seen
in
the
streets
of
Alcala
at
that
*NL*
time
;
a
bright
,
eager
,
tawny-haired
boy
peering
into
a
book-shop
where
*NL*
the
latest
volumes
lay
open
to
tempt
the
public
,
wondering
,
it
may
be
,
*NL*
what
that
little
book
with
the
woodcut
of
the
blind
beggar
and
his
boy
,
*NL*
that
called
itself
``
Vida
de
Lazarillo
de
Tormes
,
segunda
impresion
,
''
*NL*
could
be
about
;
or
with
eyes
brimming
over
with
merriment
gazing
at
one
*NL*
of
those
preposterous
portraits
of
a
knight-errant
in
outrageous
panoply
*NL*
and
plumes
with
which
the
publishers
of
chivalry
romances
loved
to
*NL*
embellish
the
title-pages
of
their
folios
.
If
the
boy
was
the
father
of
*NL*
the
man
,
the
sense
of
the
incongruous
that
was
strong
at
fifty
was
lively
*NL*
at
ten
,
and
some
such
reflections
as
these
may
have
been
the
true
genesis
*NL*
of
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
his
more
solid
education
,
we
are
told
,
he
went
to
Salamanca
.
But
why
*NL*
Rodrigo
de
Cervantes
,
who
was
very
poor
,
should
have
sent
his
son
to
a
*NL*
university
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
away
when
he
had
one
at
his
own
*NL*
door
,
would
be
a
puzzle
,
if
we
had
any
reason
for
supposing
that
he
did
*NL*
so
.
The
only
evidence
is
a
vague
statement
by
Professor
Tomas
Gonzalez
,
*NL*
that
he
once
saw
an
old
entry
of
the
matriculation
of
a
Miguel
de
*NL*
Cervantes
.
This
does
not
appear
to
have
been
ever
seen
again
;
but
even
if
*NL*
it
had
,
and
if
the
date
corresponded
,
it
would
prove
nothing
,
as
there
*NL*
were
at
least
two
other
Miguels
born
about
the
middle
of
the
century
;
one
*NL*
of
them
,
moreover
,
a
Cervantes
Saavedra
,
a
cousin
,
no
doubt
,
who
was
a
*NL*
source
of
great
embarrassment
to
the
biographers
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
he
was
a
student
neither
at
Salamanca
nor
at
Alcala
is
best
proved
*NL*
by
his
own
works
.
No
man
drew
more
largely
upon
experience
than
he
did
,
*NL*
and
he
has
nowhere
left
a
single
reminiscence
of
student
life-for
the
*NL*
``
Tia
Fingida
,
''
if
it
be
his
,
is
not
one
--
nothing
,
not
even
``
a
college
*NL*
joke
,
''
to
show
that
he
remembered
days
that
most
men
remember
best
.
All
*NL*
that
we
know
positively
about
his
education
is
that
Juan
Lopez
de
Hoyos
,
*NL*
a
professor
of
humanities
and
belles-lettres
of
some
eminence
,
calls
him
*NL*
his
``
dear
and
beloved
pupil
.
''
This
was
in
a
little
collection
of
verses
*NL*
by
different
hands
on
the
death
of
Isabel
de
Valois
,
second
queen
of
*NL*
Philip
II
,
published
by
the
professor
in
1569
,
to
which
Cervantes
*NL*
contributed
four
pieces
,
including
an
elegy
,
and
an
epitaph
in
the
form
*NL*
of
a
sonnet
.
It
is
only
by
a
rare
chance
that
a
``
Lycidas
''
finds
its
way
*NL*
into
a
volume
of
this
sort
,
and
Cervantes
was
no
Milton
.
His
verses
are
*NL*
no
worse
than
such
things
usually
are
;
so
much
,
at
least
,
may
be
said
for
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
the
book
appeared
he
had
left
Spain
,
and
,
as
fate
ordered
it
,
*NL*
for
twelve
years
,
the
most
eventful
ones
of
his
life
.
Giulio
,
afterwards
*NL*
Cardinal
,
Acquaviva
had
been
sent
at
the
end
of
1568
to
Philip
II
by
the
*NL*
Pope
on
a
mission
,
partly
of
condolence
,
partly
political
,
and
on
his
*NL*
return
to
Rome
,
which
was
somewhat
brusquely
expedited
by
the
King
,
he
*NL*
took
Cervantes
with
him
as
his
camarero
-LRB-
chamberlain
-RRB-
,
the
office
he
*NL*
himself
held
in
the
Pope
's
household
.
The
post
would
no
doubt
have
led
to
*NL*
advancement
at
the
Papal
Court
had
Cervantes
retained
it
,
but
in
the
*NL*
summer
of
1570
he
resigned
it
and
enlisted
as
a
private
soldier
in
*NL*
Captain
Diego
Urbina
's
company
,
belonging
to
Don
Miguel
de
Moncada
's
*NL*
regiment
,
but
at
that
time
forming
a
part
of
the
command
of
Marc
Antony
*NL*
Colonna
.
What
impelled
him
to
this
step
we
know
not
,
whether
it
was
*NL*
distaste
for
the
career
before
him
,
or
purely
military
enthusiasm
.
It
may
*NL*
well
have
been
the
latter
,
for
it
was
a
stirring
time
;
the
events
,
*NL*
however
,
which
led
to
the
alliance
between
Spain
,
Venice
,
and
the
Pope
,
*NL*
against
the
common
enemy
,
the
Porte
,
and
to
the
victory
of
the
combined
*NL*
fleets
at
Lepanto
,
belong
rather
to
the
history
of
Europe
than
to
the
*NL*
life
of
Cervantes
.
He
was
one
of
those
that
sailed
from
Messina
,
in
*NL*
September
1571
,
under
the
command
of
Don
John
of
Austria
;
but
on
the
*NL*
morning
of
the
7th
of
October
,
when
the
Turkish
fleet
was
sighted
,
he
was
*NL*
lying
below
ill
with
fever
.
At
the
news
that
the
enemy
was
in
sight
he
*NL*
rose
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
his
comrades
and
superiors
,
*NL*
insisted
on
taking
his
post
,
saying
he
preferred
death
in
the
service
of
*NL*
God
and
the
King
to
health
.
His
galley
,
the
Marquesa
,
was
in
the
thick
of
*NL*
the
fight
,
and
before
it
was
over
he
had
received
three
gunshot
wounds
,
*NL*
two
in
the
breast
and
one
in
the
left
hand
or
arm
.
On
the
morning
after
*NL*
the
battle
,
according
to
Navarrete
,
he
had
an
interview
with
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
,
Don
John
,
who
was
making
a
personal
inspection
of
the
*NL*
wounded
,
one
result
of
which
was
an
addition
of
three
crowns
to
his
pay
,
*NL*
and
another
,
apparently
,
the
friendship
of
his
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
severely
Cervantes
was
wounded
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
,
that
*NL*
with
youth
,
a
vigorous
frame
,
and
as
cheerful
and
buoyant
a
temperament
*NL*
as
ever
invalid
had
,
he
was
seven
months
in
hospital
at
Messina
before
he
*NL*
was
discharged
.
He
came
out
with
his
left
hand
permanently
disabled
;
he
*NL*
had
lost
the
use
of
it
,
as
Mercury
told
him
in
the
``
Viaje
del
Parnaso
''
*NL*
for
the
greater
glory
of
the
right
.
This
,
however
,
did
not
absolutely
*NL*
unfit
him
for
service
,
and
in
April
1572
he
joined
Manuel
Ponce
de
Leon
's
*NL*
company
of
Lope
de
Figueroa
's
regiment
,
in
which
,
it
seems
probable
,
his
*NL*
brother
Rodrigo
was
serving
,
and
shared
in
the
operations
of
the
next
*NL*
three
years
,
including
the
capture
of
the
Goletta
and
Tunis
.
Taking
*NL*
advantage
of
the
lull
which
followed
the
recapture
of
these
places
by
the
*NL*
Turks
,
he
obtained
leave
to
return
to
Spain
,
and
sailed
from
Naples
in
*NL*
September
1575
on
board
the
Sun
galley
,
in
company
with
his
brother
*NL*
Rodrigo
,
Pedro
Carrillo
de
Quesada
,
late
Governor
of
the
Goletta
,
and
*NL*
some
others
,
and
furnished
with
letters
from
Don
John
of
Austria
and
the
*NL*
Duke
of
Sesa
,
the
Viceroy
of
Sicily
,
recommending
him
to
the
King
for
the
*NL*
command
of
a
company
,
on
account
of
his
services
;
a
dono
infelice
as
*NL*
events
proved
.
On
the
26th
they
fell
in
with
a
squadron
of
Algerine
*NL*
galleys
,
and
after
a
stout
resistance
were
overpowered
and
carried
into
*NL*
Algiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
means
of
a
ransomed
fellow-captive
the
brothers
contrived
to
inform
*NL*
their
family
of
their
condition
,
and
the
poor
people
at
Alcala
at
once
*NL*
strove
to
raise
the
ransom
money
,
the
father
disposing
of
all
he
*NL*
possessed
,
and
the
two
sisters
giving
up
their
marriage
portions
.
But
*NL*
Dali
Mami
had
found
on
Cervantes
the
letters
addressed
to
the
King
by
Don
*NL*
John
and
the
Duke
of
Sesa
,
and
,
concluding
that
his
prize
must
be
a
*NL*
person
of
great
consequence
,
when
the
money
came
he
refused
it
scornfully
*NL*
as
being
altogether
insufficient
.
The
owner
of
Rodrigo
,
however
,
was
more
*NL*
easily
satisfied
;
ransom
was
accepted
in
his
case
,
and
it
was
arranged
*NL*
between
the
brothers
that
he
should
return
to
Spain
and
procure
a
vessel
*NL*
in
which
he
was
to
come
back
to
Algiers
and
take
off
Miguel
and
as
many
*NL*
of
their
comrades
as
possible
.
This
was
not
the
first
attempt
to
escape
*NL*
that
Cervantes
had
made
.
Soon
after
the
commencement
of
his
captivity
he
*NL*
induced
several
of
his
companions
to
join
him
in
trying
to
reach
Oran
,
*NL*
then
a
Spanish
post
,
on
foot
;
but
after
the
first
day
's
journey
,
the
Moor
*NL*
who
had
agreed
to
act
as
their
guide
deserted
them
,
and
they
had
no
*NL*
choice
but
to
return
.
The
second
attempt
was
more
disastrous
.
In
a
garden
*NL*
outside
the
city
on
the
sea-shore
,
he
constructed
,
with
the
help
of
the
*NL*
gardener
,
a
Spaniard
,
a
hiding-place
,
to
which
he
brought
,
one
by
one
,
*NL*
fourteen
of
his
fellow-captives
,
keeping
them
there
in
secrecy
for
*NL*
several
months
,
and
supplying
them
with
food
through
a
renegade
known
as
*NL*
El
Dorador
,
``
the
Gilder
.
''
How
he
,
a
captive
himself
,
contrived
to
do
all
*NL*
this
,
is
one
of
the
mysteries
of
the
story
.
Wild
as
the
project
may
*NL*
appear
,
it
was
very
nearly
successful
.
The
vessel
procured
by
Rodrigo
*NL*
made
its
appearance
off
the
coast
,
and
under
cover
of
night
was
*NL*
proceeding
to
take
off
the
refugees
,
when
the
crew
were
alarmed
by
a
*NL*
passing
fishing
boat
,
and
beat
a
hasty
retreat
.
On
renewing
the
attempt
*NL*
shortly
afterwards
,
they
,
or
a
portion
of
them
at
least
,
were
taken
*NL*
prisoners
,
and
just
as
the
poor
fellows
in
the
garden
were
exulting
in
*NL*
the
thought
that
in
a
few
moments
more
freedom
would
be
within
their
*NL*
grasp
,
they
found
themselves
surrounded
by
Turkish
troops
,
horse
and
*NL*
foot
.
The
Dorador
had
revealed
the
whole
scheme
to
the
Dey
Hassan
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Cervantes
saw
what
had
befallen
them
,
he
charged
his
companions
to
*NL*
lay
all
the
blame
upon
him
,
and
as
they
were
being
bound
he
declared
*NL*
aloud
that
the
whole
plot
was
of
his
contriving
,
and
that
nobody
else
had
*NL*
any
share
in
it
.
Brought
before
the
Dey
,
he
said
the
same
.
He
was
*NL*
threatened
with
impalement
and
with
torture
;
and
as
cutting
off
ears
and
*NL*
noses
were
playful
freaks
with
the
Algerines
,
it
may
be
conceived
what
*NL*
their
tortures
were
like
;
but
nothing
could
make
him
swerve
from
his
*NL*
original
statement
that
he
and
he
alone
was
responsible
.
The
upshot
was
*NL*
that
the
unhappy
gardener
was
hanged
by
his
master
,
and
the
prisoners
*NL*
taken
possession
of
by
the
Dey
,
who
,
however
,
afterwards
restored
most
of
*NL*
them
to
their
masters
,
but
kept
Cervantes
,
paying
Dali
Mami
500
crowns
*NL*
for
him
.
He
felt
,
no
doubt
,
that
a
man
of
such
resource
,
energy
,
and
*NL*
daring
,
was
too
dangerous
a
piece
of
property
to
be
left
in
private
*NL*
hands
;
and
he
had
him
heavily
ironed
and
lodged
in
his
own
prison
.
If
he
*NL*
thought
that
by
these
means
he
could
break
the
spirit
or
shake
the
*NL*
resolution
of
his
prisoner
,
he
was
soon
undeceived
,
for
Cervantes
*NL*
contrived
before
long
to
despatch
a
letter
to
the
Governor
of
Oran
,
*NL*
entreating
him
to
send
him
some
one
that
could
be
trusted
,
to
enable
him
*NL*
and
three
other
gentlemen
,
fellow-captives
of
his
,
to
make
their
escape
;
*NL*
intending
evidently
to
renew
his
first
attempt
with
a
more
trustworthy
*NL*
guide
.
Unfortunately
the
Moor
who
carried
the
letter
was
stopped
just
*NL*
outside
Oran
,
and
the
letter
being
found
upon
him
,
he
was
sent
back
to
*NL*
Algiers
,
where
by
the
order
of
the
Dey
he
was
promptly
impaled
as
a
*NL*
warning
to
others
,
while
Cervantes
was
condemned
to
receive
two
thousand
*NL*
blows
of
the
stick
,
a
number
which
most
likely
would
have
deprived
the
*NL*
world
of
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
had
not
some
persons
,
who
they
were
we
know
not
,
*NL*
interceded
on
his
behalf
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
he
seems
to
have
been
kept
in
still
closer
confinement
than
*NL*
before
,
for
nearly
two
years
passed
before
he
made
another
attempt
.
This
*NL*
time
his
plan
was
to
purchase
,
by
the
aid
of
a
Spanish
renegade
and
two
*NL*
Valencian
merchants
resident
in
Algiers
,
an
armed
vessel
in
which
he
and
*NL*
about
sixty
of
the
leading
captives
were
to
make
their
escape
;
but
just
*NL*
as
they
were
about
to
put
it
into
execution
one
Doctor
Juan
Blanco
de
*NL*
Paz
,
an
ecclesiastic
and
a
compatriot
,
informed
the
Dey
of
the
plot
.
*NL*
Cervantes
by
force
of
character
,
by
his
self-devotion
,
by
his
untiring
*NL*
energy
and
his
exertions
to
lighten
the
lot
of
his
companions
in
misery
,
*NL*
had
endeared
himself
to
all
,
and
become
the
leading
spirit
in
the
captive
*NL*
colony
,
and
,
incredible
as
it
may
seem
,
jealousy
of
his
influence
and
the
*NL*
esteem
in
which
he
was
held
,
moved
this
man
to
compass
his
destruction
by
*NL*
a
cruel
death
.
The
merchants
finding
that
the
Dey
knew
all
,
and
fearing
*NL*
that
Cervantes
under
torture
might
make
disclosures
that
would
imperil
*NL*
their
own
lives
,
tried
to
persuade
him
to
slip
away
on
board
a
vessel
*NL*
that
was
on
the
point
of
sailing
for
Spain
;
but
he
told
them
they
had
*NL*
nothing
to
fear
,
for
no
tortures
would
make
him
compromise
anybody
,
and
*NL*
he
went
at
once
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
Dey
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
before
,
the
Dey
tried
to
force
him
to
name
his
accomplices
.
Everything
*NL*
was
made
ready
for
his
immediate
execution
;
the
halter
was
put
round
his
*NL*
neck
and
his
hands
tied
behind
him
,
but
all
that
could
be
got
from
him
*NL*
was
that
he
himself
,
with
the
help
of
four
gentlemen
who
had
since
left
*NL*
Algiers
,
had
arranged
the
whole
,
and
that
the
sixty
who
were
to
accompany
*NL*
him
were
not
to
know
anything
of
it
until
the
last
moment
.
Finding
he
*NL*
could
make
nothing
of
him
,
the
Dey
sent
him
back
to
prison
more
heavily
*NL*
ironed
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poverty-stricken
Cervantes
family
had
been
all
this
time
trying
once
*NL*
more
to
raise
the
ransom
money
,
and
at
last
a
sum
of
three
hundred
ducats
*NL*
was
got
together
and
entrusted
to
the
Redemptorist
Father
Juan
Gil
,
who
*NL*
was
about
to
sail
for
Algiers
.
The
Dey
,
however
,
demanded
more
than
*NL*
double
the
sum
offered
,
and
as
his
term
of
office
had
expired
and
he
was
*NL*
about
to
sail
for
Constantinople
,
taking
all
his
slaves
with
him
,
the
*NL*
case
of
Cervantes
was
critical
.
He
was
already
on
board
heavily
ironed
,
*NL*
when
the
Dey
at
length
agreed
to
reduce
his
demand
by
one-half
,
and
*NL*
Father
Gil
by
borrowing
was
able
to
make
up
the
amount
,
and
on
September
*NL*
19
,
1580
,
after
a
captivity
of
five
years
all
but
a
week
,
Cervantes
was
*NL*
at
last
set
free
.
Before
long
he
discovered
that
Blanco
de
Paz
,
who
*NL*
claimed
to
be
an
officer
of
the
Inquisition
,
was
now
concocting
on
false
*NL*
evidence
a
charge
of
misconduct
to
be
brought
against
him
on
his
return
*NL*
to
Spain
.
To
checkmate
him
Cervantes
drew
up
a
series
of
twenty-five
*NL*
questions
,
covering
the
whole
period
of
his
captivity
,
upon
which
he
*NL*
requested
Father
Gil
to
take
the
depositions
of
credible
witnesses
before
*NL*
a
notary
.
Eleven
witnesses
taken
from
among
the
principal
captives
in
*NL*
Algiers
deposed
to
all
the
facts
above
stated
and
to
a
great
deal
more
*NL*
besides
.
There
is
something
touching
in
the
admiration
,
love
,
and
*NL*
gratitude
we
see
struggling
to
find
expression
in
the
formal
language
of
*NL*
the
notary
,
as
they
testify
one
after
another
to
the
good
deeds
of
*NL*
Cervantes
,
how
he
comforted
and
helped
the
weak-hearted
,
how
he
kept
up
*NL*
their
drooping
courage
,
how
he
shared
his
poor
purse
with
this
deponent
,
*NL*
and
how
``
in
him
this
deponent
found
father
and
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
return
to
Spain
he
found
his
old
regiment
about
to
march
for
*NL*
Portugal
to
support
Philip
's
claim
to
the
crown
,
and
utterly
penniless
*NL*
now
,
had
no
choice
but
to
rejoin
it
.
He
was
in
the
expeditions
to
the
*NL*
Azores
in
1582
and
the
following
year
,
and
on
the
conclusion
of
the
war
*NL*
returned
to
Spain
in
the
autumn
of
1583
,
bringing
with
him
the
manuscript
*NL*
of
his
pastoral
romance
,
the
``
Galatea
,
''
and
probably
also
,
to
judge
by
*NL*
internal
evidence
,
that
of
the
first
portion
of
``
Persiles
and
*NL*
Sigismunda
.
''
He
also
brought
back
with
him
,
his
biographers
assert
,
an
*NL*
infant
daughter
,
the
offspring
of
an
amour
,
as
some
of
them
with
great
*NL*
circumstantiality
inform
us
,
with
a
Lisbon
lady
of
noble
birth
,
whose
*NL*
name
,
however
,
as
well
as
that
of
the
street
she
lived
in
,
they
omit
to
*NL*
mention
.
The
sole
foundation
for
all
this
is
that
in
1605
there
certainly
*NL*
was
living
in
the
family
of
Cervantes
a
Dona
Isabel
de
Saavedra
,
who
is
*NL*
described
in
an
official
document
as
his
natural
daughter
,
and
then
*NL*
twenty
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
his
crippled
left
hand
promotion
in
the
army
was
hopeless
,
now
that
*NL*
Don
John
was
dead
and
he
had
no
one
to
press
his
claims
and
services
,
and
*NL*
for
a
man
drawing
on
to
forty
life
in
the
ranks
was
a
dismal
prospect
;
he
*NL*
had
already
a
certain
reputation
as
a
poet
;
he
made
up
his
mind
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
cast
his
lot
with
literature
,
and
for
a
first
venture
*NL*
committed
his
``
Galatea
''
to
the
press
.
It
was
published
,
as
Salva
y
Mallen
*NL*
shows
conclusively
,
at
Alcala
,
his
own
birth-place
,
in
1585
and
no
doubt
*NL*
helped
to
make
his
name
more
widely
known
,
but
certainly
did
not
do
him
*NL*
much
good
in
any
other
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
it
was
going
through
the
press
,
he
married
Dona
Catalina
de
*NL*
Palacios
Salazar
y
Vozmediano
,
a
lady
of
Esquivias
near
Madrid
,
and
*NL*
apparently
a
friend
of
the
family
,
who
brought
him
a
fortune
which
may
*NL*
possibly
have
served
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
,
but
if
so
,
that
was
*NL*
all
.
The
drama
had
by
this
time
outgrown
market-place
stages
and
*NL*
strolling
companies
,
and
with
his
old
love
for
it
he
naturally
turned
to
*NL*
it
for
a
congenial
employment
.
In
about
three
years
he
wrote
twenty
or
*NL*
thirty
plays
,
which
he
tells
us
were
performed
without
any
throwing
of
*NL*
cucumbers
or
other
missiles
,
and
ran
their
course
without
any
hisses
,
*NL*
outcries
,
or
disturbance
.
In
other
words
,
his
plays
were
not
bad
enough
*NL*
to
be
hissed
off
the
stage
,
but
not
good
enough
to
hold
their
own
upon
*NL*
it
.
Only
two
of
them
have
been
preserved
,
but
as
they
happen
to
be
two
of
*NL*
the
seven
or
eight
he
mentions
with
complacency
,
we
may
assume
they
are
*NL*
favourable
specimens
,
and
no
one
who
reads
the
``
Numancia
''
and
the
``
Trato
*NL*
de
Argel
''
will
feel
any
surprise
that
they
failed
as
acting
dramas
.
*NL*
Whatever
merits
they
may
have
,
whatever
occasional
they
may
show
,
they
*NL*
are
,
as
regards
construction
,
incurably
clumsy
.
How
completely
they
*NL*
failed
is
manifest
from
the
fact
that
with
all
his
sanguine
temperament
*NL*
and
indomitable
perseverance
he
was
unable
to
maintain
the
struggle
to
*NL*
gain
a
livelihood
as
a
dramatist
for
more
than
three
years
;
nor
was
the
*NL*
rising
popularity
of
Lope
the
cause
,
as
is
often
said
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
his
own
words
to
the
contrary
.
When
Lope
began
to
write
for
the
stage
is
*NL*
uncertain
,
but
it
was
certainly
after
Cervantes
went
to
Seville
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
``
Nuevos
Documentos
''
printed
by
Senor
Asensio
y
Toledo
is
one
*NL*
dated
1592
,
and
curiously
characteristic
of
Cervantes
.
It
is
an
agreement
*NL*
with
one
Rodrigo
Osorio
,
a
manager
,
who
was
to
accept
six
comedies
at
*NL*
fifty
ducats
-LRB-
about
6l
.
-RRB-
apiece
,
not
to
be
paid
in
any
case
unless
it
*NL*
appeared
on
representation
that
the
said
comedy
was
one
of
the
best
that
*NL*
had
ever
been
represented
in
Spain
.
The
test
does
not
seem
to
have
been
*NL*
ever
applied
;
perhaps
it
was
sufficiently
apparent
to
Rodrigo
Osorio
that
*NL*
the
comedies
were
not
among
the
best
that
had
ever
been
represented
.
*NL*
Among
the
correspondence
of
Cervantes
there
might
have
been
found
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
more
than
one
letter
like
that
we
see
in
the
``
Rake
's
Progress
,
''
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
have
read
your
play
,
and
it
will
not
doo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
more
successful
in
a
literary
contest
at
Saragossa
in
1595
in
*NL*
honour
of
the
canonisation
of
St.
Jacinto
,
when
his
composition
won
the
*NL*
first
prize
,
three
silver
spoons
.
The
year
before
this
he
had
been
*NL*
appointed
a
collector
of
revenues
for
the
kingdom
of
Granada
.
In
order
to
*NL*
remit
the
money
he
had
collected
more
conveniently
to
the
treasury
,
he
*NL*
entrusted
it
to
a
merchant
,
who
failed
and
absconded
;
and
as
the
*NL*
bankrupt
's
assets
were
insufficient
to
cover
the
whole
,
he
was
sent
to
*NL*
prison
at
Seville
in
September
1597
.
The
balance
against
him
,
however
,
*NL*
was
a
small
one
,
about
26l.
,
and
on
giving
security
for
it
he
was
*NL*
released
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
he
journeyed
from
town
to
town
collecting
the
king
's
taxes
,
*NL*
that
he
noted
down
those
bits
of
inn
and
wayside
life
and
character
that
*NL*
abound
in
the
pages
of
``
Don
Quixote
:
''
the
Benedictine
monks
with
*NL*
spectacles
and
sunshades
,
mounted
on
their
tall
mules
;
the
strollers
in
*NL*
costume
bound
for
the
next
village
;
the
barber
with
his
basin
on
his
*NL*
head
,
on
his
way
to
bleed
a
patient
;
the
recruit
with
his
breeches
in
his
*NL*
bundle
,
tramping
along
the
road
singing
;
the
reapers
gathered
in
the
*NL*
venta
gateway
listening
to
``
Felixmarte
of
Hircania
''
read
out
to
them
;
and
*NL*
those
little
Hogarthian
touches
that
he
so
well
knew
how
to
bring
in
,
the
*NL*
ox-tail
hanging
up
with
the
landlord
's
comb
stuck
in
it
,
the
wine-skins
*NL*
at
the
bed-head
,
and
those
notable
examples
of
hostelry
art
,
Helen
going
*NL*
off
in
high
spirits
on
Paris
's
arm
,
and
Dido
on
the
tower
dropping
tears
*NL*
as
big
as
walnuts
.
Nay
,
it
may
well
be
that
on
those
journeys
into
remote
*NL*
regions
he
came
across
now
and
then
a
specimen
of
the
pauper
gentleman
,
*NL*
with
his
lean
hack
and
his
greyhound
and
his
books
of
chivalry
,
dreaming
*NL*
away
his
life
in
happy
ignorance
that
the
world
had
changed
since
his
*NL*
great-grandfather
's
old
helmet
was
new
.
But
it
was
in
Seville
that
he
*NL*
found
out
his
true
vocation
,
though
he
himself
would
not
by
any
means
*NL*
have
admitted
it
to
be
so
.
It
was
there
,
in
Triana
,
that
he
was
first
*NL*
tempted
to
try
his
hand
at
drawing
from
life
,
and
first
brought
his
*NL*
humour
into
play
in
the
exquisite
little
sketch
of
``
Rinconete
y
*NL*
Cortadillo
,
''
the
germ
,
in
more
ways
than
one
,
of
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Where
and
when
that
was
written
,
we
can
not
tell
.
After
his
imprisonment
*NL*
all
trace
of
Cervantes
in
his
official
capacity
disappears
,
from
which
it
*NL*
may
be
inferred
that
he
was
not
reinstated
.
That
he
was
still
in
Seville
*NL*
in
November
1598
appears
from
a
satirical
sonnet
of
his
on
the
elaborate
*NL*
catafalque
erected
to
testify
the
grief
of
the
city
at
the
death
of
*NL*
Philip
II
,
but
from
this
up
to
1603
we
have
no
clue
to
his
movements
.
The
*NL*
words
in
the
preface
to
the
First
Part
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
are
generally
*NL*
held
to
be
conclusive
that
he
conceived
the
idea
of
the
book
,
and
wrote
*NL*
the
beginning
of
it
at
least
,
in
a
prison
,
and
that
he
may
have
done
so
*NL*
is
extremely
likely
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
tradition
that
Cervantes
read
some
portions
of
his
work
to
a
*NL*
select
audience
at
the
Duke
of
Bejar
's
,
which
may
have
helped
to
make
the
*NL*
book
known
;
but
the
obvious
conclusion
is
that
the
First
Part
of
``
Don
*NL*
Quixote
''
lay
on
his
hands
some
time
before
he
could
find
a
publisher
bold
*NL*
enough
to
undertake
a
venture
of
so
novel
a
character
;
and
so
little
*NL*
faith
in
it
had
Francisco
Robles
of
Madrid
,
to
whom
at
last
he
sold
it
,
*NL*
that
he
did
not
care
to
incur
the
expense
of
securing
the
copyright
for
*NL*
Aragon
or
Portugal
,
contenting
himself
with
that
for
Castile
.
The
*NL*
printing
was
finished
in
December
,
and
the
book
came
out
with
the
new
*NL*
year
,
1605
.
It
is
often
said
that
``
Don
Quixote
''
was
at
first
received
*NL*
coldly
.
The
facts
show
just
the
contrary
.
No
sooner
was
it
in
the
hands
*NL*
of
the
public
than
preparations
were
made
to
issue
pirated
editions
at
*NL*
Lisbon
and
Valencia
,
and
to
bring
out
a
second
edition
with
the
*NL*
additional
copyrights
for
Aragon
and
Portugal
,
which
he
secured
in
*NL*
February
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
it
was
received
with
something
more
than
coldness
by
certain
*NL*
sections
of
the
community
.
Men
of
wit
,
taste
,
and
discrimination
among
*NL*
the
aristocracy
gave
it
a
hearty
welcome
,
but
the
aristocracy
in
general
*NL*
were
not
likely
to
relish
a
book
that
turned
their
favourite
reading
into
*NL*
ridicule
and
laughed
at
so
many
of
their
favourite
ideas
.
The
dramatists
*NL*
who
gathered
round
Lope
as
their
leader
regarded
Cervantes
as
their
*NL*
common
enemy
,
and
it
is
plain
that
he
was
equally
obnoxious
to
the
other
*NL*
clique
,
the
culto
poets
who
had
Gongora
for
their
chief
.
Navarrete
,
who
*NL*
knew
nothing
of
the
letter
above
mentioned
,
tries
hard
to
show
that
the
*NL*
relations
between
Cervantes
and
Lope
were
of
a
very
friendly
sort
,
as
*NL*
indeed
they
were
until
``
Don
Quixote
''
was
written
.
Cervantes
,
indeed
,
to
*NL*
the
last
generously
and
manfully
declared
his
admiration
of
Lope
's
*NL*
powers
,
his
unfailing
invention
,
and
his
marvellous
fertility
;
but
in
the
*NL*
preface
of
the
First
Part
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
and
in
the
verses
of
``
Urganda
*NL*
the
Unknown
,
''
and
one
or
two
other
places
,
there
are
,
if
we
read
between
*NL*
the
lines
,
sly
hits
at
Lope
's
vanities
and
affectations
that
argue
no
*NL*
personal
good-will
;
and
Lope
openly
sneers
at
``
Don
Quixote
''
and
*NL*
Cervantes
,
and
fourteen
years
after
his
death
gives
him
only
a
few
lines
*NL*
of
cold
commonplace
in
the
``
Laurel
de
Apolo
,
''
that
seem
all
the
colder
*NL*
for
the
eulogies
of
a
host
of
nonentities
whose
names
are
found
nowhere
*NL*
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1601
Valladolid
was
made
the
seat
of
the
Court
,
and
at
the
beginning
*NL*
of
1603
Cervantes
had
been
summoned
thither
in
connection
with
the
*NL*
balance
due
by
him
to
the
Treasury
,
which
was
still
outstanding
.
He
*NL*
remained
at
Valladolid
,
apparently
supporting
himself
by
agencies
and
*NL*
scrivener
's
work
of
some
sort
;
probably
drafting
petitions
and
drawing
up
*NL*
statements
of
claims
to
be
presented
to
the
Council
,
and
the
like
.
So
,
at
*NL*
least
,
we
gather
from
the
depositions
taken
on
the
occasion
of
the
death
*NL*
of
a
gentleman
,
the
victim
of
a
street
brawl
,
who
had
been
carried
into
*NL*
the
house
in
which
he
lived
.
In
these
he
himself
is
described
as
a
man
*NL*
who
wrote
and
transacted
business
,
and
it
appears
that
his
household
then
*NL*
consisted
of
his
wife
,
the
natural
daughter
Isabel
de
Saavedra
already
*NL*
mentioned
,
his
sister
Andrea
,
now
a
widow
,
her
daughter
Constanza
,
a
*NL*
mysterious
Magdalena
de
Sotomayor
calling
herself
his
sister
,
for
whom
*NL*
his
biographers
can
not
account
,
and
a
servant-maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
``
Don
Quixote
''
had
been
growing
in
favour
,
and
its
author
's
name
*NL*
was
now
known
beyond
the
Pyrenees
.
In
1607
an
edition
was
printed
at
*NL*
Brussels
.
Robles
,
the
Madrid
publisher
,
found
it
necessary
to
meet
the
*NL*
demand
by
a
third
edition
,
the
seventh
in
all
,
in
1608
.
The
popularity
of
*NL*
the
book
in
Italy
was
such
that
a
Milan
bookseller
was
led
to
bring
out
*NL*
an
edition
in
1610
;
and
another
was
called
for
in
Brussels
in
1611
.
It
*NL*
might
naturally
have
been
expected
that
,
with
such
proofs
before
him
that
*NL*
he
had
hit
the
taste
of
the
public
,
Cervantes
would
have
at
once
set
*NL*
about
redeeming
his
rather
vague
promise
of
a
second
volume
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
to
all
appearance
,
nothing
was
farther
from
his
thoughts
.
He
had
*NL*
still
by
him
one
or
two
short
tales
of
the
same
vintage
as
those
he
had
*NL*
inserted
in
``
Don
Quixote
''
and
instead
of
continuing
the
adventures
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
he
set
to
work
to
write
more
of
these
``
Novelas
Exemplares
''
as
he
*NL*
afterwards
called
them
,
with
a
view
to
making
a
book
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
novels
were
published
in
the
summer
of
1613
,
with
a
dedication
to
the
*NL*
Conde
de
Lemos
,
the
Maecenas
of
the
day
,
and
with
one
of
those
chatty
*NL*
confidential
prefaces
Cervantes
was
so
fond
of
.
In
this
,
eight
years
and
*NL*
a
half
after
the
First
Part
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
had
appeared
,
we
get
the
*NL*
first
hint
of
a
forthcoming
Second
Part
.
``
You
shall
see
shortly
,
''
he
*NL*
says
,
``
the
further
exploits
of
Don
Quixote
and
humours
of
Sancho
Panza
.
''
*NL*
His
idea
of
``
shortly
''
was
a
somewhat
elastic
one
,
for
,
as
we
know
by
the
*NL*
date
to
Sancho
's
letter
,
he
had
barely
one-half
of
the
book
completed
*NL*
that
time
twelvemonth
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
more
than
poems
,
or
pastorals
,
or
novels
,
it
was
his
dramatic
*NL*
ambition
that
engrossed
his
thoughts
.
The
same
indomitable
spirit
that
*NL*
kept
him
from
despair
in
the
bagnios
of
Algiers
,
and
prompted
him
to
*NL*
attempt
the
escape
of
himself
and
his
comrades
again
and
again
,
made
him
*NL*
persevere
in
spite
of
failure
and
discouragement
in
his
efforts
to
win
*NL*
the
ear
of
the
public
as
a
dramatist
.
The
temperament
of
Cervantes
was
*NL*
essentially
sanguine
.
The
portrait
he
draws
in
the
preface
to
the
novels
,
*NL*
with
the
aquiline
features
,
chestnut
hair
,
smooth
untroubled
forehead
,
*NL*
and
bright
cheerful
eyes
,
is
the
very
portrait
of
a
sanguine
man
.
Nothing
*NL*
that
the
managers
might
say
could
persuade
him
that
the
merits
of
his
*NL*
plays
would
not
be
recognised
at
last
if
they
were
only
given
a
fair
*NL*
chance
.
The
old
soldier
of
the
Spanish
Salamis
was
bent
on
being
the
*NL*
Aeschylus
of
Spain
.
He
was
to
found
a
great
national
drama
,
based
on
the
*NL*
true
principles
of
art
,
that
was
to
be
the
envy
of
all
nations
;
he
was
to
*NL*
drive
from
the
stage
the
silly
,
childish
plays
,
the
``
mirrors
of
nonsense
*NL*
and
models
of
folly
''
that
were
in
vogue
through
the
cupidity
of
the
*NL*
managers
and
shortsightedness
of
the
authors
;
he
was
to
correct
and
*NL*
educate
the
public
taste
until
it
was
ripe
for
tragedies
on
the
model
of
*NL*
the
Greek
drama
--
like
the
``
Numancia
''
for
instance
--
and
comedies
that
*NL*
would
not
only
amuse
but
improve
and
instruct
.
All
this
he
was
to
do
,
*NL*
could
he
once
get
a
hearing
:
there
was
the
initial
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shows
plainly
enough
,
too
,
that
``
Don
Quixote
''
and
the
demolition
of
*NL*
the
chivalry
romances
was
not
the
work
that
lay
next
his
heart
.
He
was
,
*NL*
indeed
,
as
he
says
himself
in
his
preface
,
more
a
stepfather
than
a
*NL*
father
to
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
Never
was
great
work
so
neglected
by
its
author
.
*NL*
That
it
was
written
carelessly
,
hastily
,
and
by
fits
and
starts
,
was
not
*NL*
always
his
fault
,
but
it
seems
clear
he
never
read
what
he
sent
to
the
*NL*
press
.
He
knew
how
the
printers
had
blundered
,
but
he
never
took
the
*NL*
trouble
to
correct
them
when
the
third
edition
was
in
progress
,
as
a
man
*NL*
who
really
cared
for
the
child
of
his
brain
would
have
done
.
He
appears
*NL*
to
have
regarded
the
book
as
little
more
than
a
mere
libro
de
*NL*
entretenimiento
,
an
amusing
book
,
a
thing
,
as
he
says
in
the
``
Viaje
,
''
``
to
*NL*
divert
the
melancholy
moody
heart
at
any
time
or
season
.
''
No
doubt
he
had
*NL*
an
affection
for
his
hero
,
and
was
very
proud
of
Sancho
Panza
.
It
would
*NL*
have
been
strange
indeed
if
he
had
not
been
proud
of
the
most
humorous
*NL*
creation
in
all
fiction
.
He
was
proud
,
too
,
of
the
popularity
and
success
*NL*
of
the
book
,
and
beyond
measure
delightful
is
the
naivete
with
which
he
*NL*
shows
his
pride
in
a
dozen
passages
in
the
Second
Part
.
But
it
was
not
*NL*
the
success
he
coveted
.
In
all
probability
he
would
have
given
all
the
*NL*
success
of
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
nay
,
would
have
seen
every
copy
of
``
Don
*NL*
Quixote
''
burned
in
the
Plaza
Mayor
,
for
one
such
success
as
Lope
de
Vega
*NL*
was
enjoying
on
an
average
once
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
went
on
,
dawdling
over
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
adding
a
chapter
now
and
*NL*
again
,
and
putting
it
aside
to
turn
to
``
Persiles
and
Sigismunda
''
--
which
,
*NL*
as
we
know
,
was
to
be
the
most
entertaining
book
in
the
language
,
and
the
*NL*
rival
of
``
Theagenes
and
Chariclea
''
--
or
finishing
off
one
of
his
darling
*NL*
comedies
;
and
if
Robles
asked
when
``
Don
Quixote
''
would
be
ready
,
the
*NL*
answer
no
doubt
was
:
En
breve-shortly
,
there
was
time
enough
for
that
.
At
*NL*
sixty-eight
he
was
as
full
of
life
and
hope
and
plans
for
the
future
as
a
*NL*
boy
of
eighteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nemesis
was
coming
,
however
.
He
had
got
as
far
as
Chapter
LIX
,
which
at
*NL*
his
leisurely
pace
he
could
hardly
have
reached
before
October
or
*NL*
November
1614
,
when
there
was
put
into
his
hand
a
small
octave
lately
*NL*
printed
at
Tarragona
,
and
calling
itself
``
Second
Volume
of
the
Ingenious
*NL*
Gentleman
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
:
by
the
Licentiate
Alonso
Fernandez
de
*NL*
Avellaneda
of
Tordesillas
.
''
The
last
half
of
Chapter
LIX
and
most
of
the
*NL*
following
chapters
of
the
Second
Part
give
us
some
idea
of
the
effect
*NL*
produced
upon
him
,
and
his
irritation
was
not
likely
to
be
lessened
by
*NL*
the
reflection
that
he
had
no
one
to
blame
but
himself
.
Had
Avellaneda
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
been
content
with
merely
bringing
out
a
continuation
to
``
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
''
Cervantes
would
have
had
no
reasonable
grievance
.
His
own
*NL*
intentions
were
expressed
in
the
very
vaguest
language
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
book
;
nay
,
in
his
last
words
,
``
forse
altro
cantera
con
miglior
plettro
,
''
*NL*
he
seems
actually
to
invite
some
one
else
to
continue
the
work
,
and
he
*NL*
made
no
sign
until
eight
years
and
a
half
had
gone
by
;
by
which
time
*NL*
Avellaneda
's
volume
was
no
doubt
written
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
Cervantes
had
no
case
,
or
a
very
bad
one
,
as
far
as
the
mere
*NL*
continuation
was
concerned
.
But
Avellaneda
chose
to
write
a
preface
to
*NL*
it
,
full
of
such
coarse
personal
abuse
as
only
an
ill-conditioned
man
*NL*
could
pour
out
.
He
taunts
Cervantes
with
being
old
,
with
having
lost
his
*NL*
hand
,
with
having
been
in
prison
,
with
being
poor
,
with
being
friendless
,
*NL*
accuses
him
of
envy
of
Lope
's
success
,
of
petulance
and
querulousness
,
*NL*
and
so
on
;
and
it
was
in
this
that
the
sting
lay
.
Avellaneda
's
reason
for
*NL*
this
personal
attack
is
obvious
enough
.
Whoever
he
may
have
been
,
it
is
*NL*
clear
that
he
was
one
of
the
dramatists
of
Lope
's
school
,
for
he
has
the
*NL*
impudence
to
charge
Cervantes
with
attacking
him
as
well
as
Lope
in
his
*NL*
criticism
on
the
drama
.
His
identification
has
exercised
the
best
critics
*NL*
and
baffled
all
the
ingenuity
and
research
that
has
been
brought
to
bear
*NL*
on
it
.
Navarrete
and
Ticknor
both
incline
to
the
belief
that
Cervantes
*NL*
knew
who
he
was
;
but
I
must
say
I
think
the
anger
he
shows
suggests
an
*NL*
invisible
assailant
;
it
is
like
the
irritation
of
a
man
stung
by
a
*NL*
mosquito
in
the
dark
.
Cervantes
from
certain
solecisms
of
language
*NL*
pronounces
him
to
be
an
Aragonese
,
and
Pellicer
,
an
Aragonese
himself
,
*NL*
supports
this
view
and
believes
him
,
moreover
,
to
have
been
an
*NL*
ecclesiastic
,
a
Dominican
probably
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
merit
Avellaneda
has
is
reflected
from
Cervantes
,
and
he
is
too
dull
*NL*
to
reflect
much
.
``
Dull
and
dirty
''
will
always
be
,
I
imagine
,
the
verdict
*NL*
of
the
vast
majority
of
unprejudiced
readers
.
He
is
,
at
best
,
a
poor
*NL*
plagiarist
;
all
he
can
do
is
to
follow
slavishly
the
lead
given
him
by
*NL*
Cervantes
;
his
only
humour
lies
in
making
Don
Quixote
take
inns
for
*NL*
castles
and
fancy
himself
some
legendary
or
historical
personage
,
and
*NL*
Sancho
mistake
words
,
invert
proverbs
,
and
display
his
gluttony
;
all
*NL*
through
he
shows
a
proclivity
to
coarseness
and
dirt
,
and
he
has
*NL*
contrived
to
introduce
two
tales
filthier
than
anything
by
the
sixteenth
*NL*
century
novellieri
and
without
their
sprightliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whatever
Avellaneda
and
his
book
may
be
,
we
must
not
forget
the
debt
*NL*
we
owe
them
.
But
for
them
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
,
``
Don
Quixote
''
would
*NL*
have
come
to
us
a
mere
torso
instead
of
a
complete
work
.
Even
if
*NL*
Cervantes
had
finished
the
volume
he
had
in
hand
,
most
assuredly
he
would
*NL*
have
left
off
with
a
promise
of
a
Third
Part
,
giving
the
further
*NL*
adventures
of
Don
Quixote
and
humours
of
Sancho
Panza
as
shepherds
.
It
is
*NL*
plain
that
he
had
at
one
time
an
intention
of
dealing
with
the
pastoral
*NL*
romances
as
he
had
dealt
with
the
books
of
chivalry
,
and
but
for
*NL*
Avellaneda
he
would
have
tried
to
carry
it
out
.
But
it
is
more
likely
*NL*
that
,
with
his
plans
,
and
projects
,
and
hopefulness
,
the
volume
would
*NL*
have
remained
unfinished
till
his
death
,
and
that
we
should
have
never
*NL*
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
Duke
and
Duchess
,
or
gone
with
Sancho
to
*NL*
Barataria
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
the
book
came
into
his
hands
he
seems
to
have
been
*NL*
haunted
by
the
fear
that
there
might
be
more
Avellanedas
in
the
field
,
*NL*
and
putting
everything
else
aside
,
he
set
himself
to
finish
off
his
task
*NL*
and
protect
Don
Quixote
in
the
only
way
he
could
,
by
killing
him
.
The
*NL*
conclusion
is
no
doubt
a
hasty
and
in
some
places
clumsy
piece
of
work
*NL*
and
the
frequent
repetition
of
the
scolding
administered
to
Avellaneda
*NL*
becomes
in
the
end
rather
wearisome
;
but
it
is
,
at
any
rate
,
a
conclusion
*NL*
and
for
that
we
must
thank
Avellaneda
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
volume
was
ready
for
the
press
in
February
,
but
was
not
printed
*NL*
till
the
very
end
of
1615
,
and
during
the
interval
Cervantes
put
together
*NL*
the
comedies
and
interludes
he
had
written
within
the
last
few
years
,
*NL*
and
,
as
he
adds
plaintively
,
found
no
demand
for
among
the
managers
,
and
*NL*
published
them
with
a
preface
,
worth
the
book
it
introduces
tenfold
,
in
*NL*
which
he
gives
an
account
of
the
early
Spanish
stage
,
and
of
his
own
*NL*
attempts
as
a
dramatist
.
It
is
needless
to
say
they
were
put
forward
by
*NL*
Cervantes
in
all
good
faith
and
full
confidence
in
their
merits
.
The
*NL*
reader
,
however
,
was
not
to
suppose
they
were
his
last
word
or
final
*NL*
effort
in
the
drama
,
for
he
had
in
hand
a
comedy
called
``
Engano
a
los
*NL*
ojos
,
''
about
which
,
if
he
mistook
not
,
there
would
be
no
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
dramatic
masterpiece
the
world
has
no
opportunity
of
judging
;
his
*NL*
health
had
been
failing
for
some
time
,
and
he
died
,
apparently
of
dropsy
,
*NL*
on
the
23rd
of
April
,
1616
,
the
day
on
which
England
lost
Shakespeare
,
*NL*
nominally
at
least
,
for
the
English
calendar
had
not
yet
been
reformed
.
*NL*
He
died
as
he
had
lived
,
accepting
his
lot
bravely
and
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
an
unhappy
life
,
that
of
Cervantes
?
His
biographers
all
tell
us
*NL*
that
it
was
;
but
I
must
say
I
doubt
it
.
It
was
a
hard
life
,
a
life
of
*NL*
poverty
,
of
incessant
struggle
,
of
toil
ill
paid
,
of
disappointment
,
but
*NL*
Cervantes
carried
within
himself
the
antidote
to
all
these
evils
.
His
was
*NL*
not
one
of
those
light
natures
that
rise
above
adversity
merely
by
virtue
*NL*
of
their
own
buoyancy
;
it
was
in
the
fortitude
of
a
high
spirit
that
he
*NL*
was
proof
against
it
.
It
is
impossible
to
conceive
Cervantes
giving
way
*NL*
to
despondency
or
prostrated
by
dejection
.
As
for
poverty
,
it
was
with
*NL*
him
a
thing
to
be
laughed
over
,
and
the
only
sigh
he
ever
allows
to
*NL*
escape
him
is
when
he
says
,
``
Happy
he
to
whom
Heaven
has
given
a
piece
of
*NL*
bread
for
which
he
is
not
bound
to
give
thanks
to
any
but
Heaven
itself
.
''
*NL*
Add
to
all
this
his
vital
energy
and
mental
activity
,
his
restless
*NL*
invention
and
his
sanguine
temperament
,
and
there
will
be
reason
enough
*NL*
to
doubt
whether
his
could
have
been
a
very
unhappy
life
.
He
who
could
*NL*
take
Cervantes
'
distresses
together
with
his
apparatus
for
enduring
them
*NL*
would
not
make
so
bad
a
bargain
,
perhaps
,
as
far
as
happiness
in
life
is
*NL*
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
his
burial-place
nothing
is
known
except
that
he
was
buried
,
in
*NL*
accordance
with
his
will
,
in
the
neighbouring
convent
of
Trinitarian
*NL*
nuns
,
of
which
it
is
supposed
his
daughter
,
Isabel
de
Saavedra
,
was
an
*NL*
inmate
,
and
that
a
few
years
afterwards
the
nuns
removed
to
another
*NL*
convent
,
carrying
their
dead
with
them
.
But
whether
the
remains
of
*NL*
Cervantes
were
included
in
the
removal
or
not
no
one
knows
,
and
the
clue
*NL*
to
their
resting-place
is
now
lost
beyond
all
hope
.
This
furnishes
*NL*
perhaps
the
least
defensible
of
the
items
in
the
charge
of
neglect
*NL*
brought
against
his
contemporaries
.
In
some
of
the
others
there
is
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
exaggeration
.
To
listen
to
most
of
his
biographers
one
would
*NL*
suppose
that
all
Spain
was
in
league
not
only
against
the
man
but
against
*NL*
his
memory
,
or
at
least
that
it
was
insensible
to
his
merits
,
and
left
*NL*
him
to
live
in
misery
and
die
of
want
.
To
talk
of
his
hard
life
and
*NL*
unworthy
employments
in
Andalusia
is
absurd
.
What
had
he
done
to
*NL*
distinguish
him
from
thousands
of
other
struggling
men
earning
a
*NL*
precarious
livelihood
?
True
,
he
was
a
gallant
soldier
,
who
had
been
*NL*
wounded
and
had
undergone
captivity
and
suffering
in
his
country
's
cause
,
*NL*
but
there
were
hundreds
of
others
in
the
same
case
.
He
had
written
a
*NL*
mediocre
specimen
of
an
insipid
class
of
romance
,
and
some
plays
which
*NL*
manifestly
did
not
comply
with
the
primary
condition
of
pleasing
:
were
*NL*
the
playgoers
to
patronise
plays
that
did
not
amuse
them
,
because
the
*NL*
author
was
to
produce
``
Don
Quixote
''
twenty
years
afterwards
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
scramble
for
copies
which
,
as
we
have
seen
,
followed
immediately
on
*NL*
the
appearance
of
the
book
,
does
not
look
like
general
insensibility
to
*NL*
its
merits
.
No
doubt
it
was
received
coldly
by
some
,
but
if
a
man
writes
*NL*
a
book
in
ridicule
of
periwigs
he
must
make
his
account
with
being
coldly
*NL*
received
by
the
periwig
wearers
and
hated
by
the
whole
tribe
of
*NL*
wigmakers
.
If
Cervantes
had
the
chivalry-romance
readers
,
the
*NL*
sentimentalists
,
the
dramatists
,
and
the
poets
of
the
period
all
against
*NL*
him
,
it
was
because
``
Don
Quixote
''
was
what
it
was
;
and
if
the
general
*NL*
public
did
not
come
forward
to
make
him
comfortable
for
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
days
,
it
is
no
more
to
be
charged
with
neglect
and
ingratitude
than
the
*NL*
English-speaking
public
that
did
not
pay
off
Scott
's
liabilities
.
It
did
*NL*
the
best
it
could
;
it
read
his
book
and
liked
it
and
bought
it
,
and
*NL*
encouraged
the
bookseller
to
pay
him
well
for
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
been
also
made
a
reproach
to
Spain
that
she
has
erected
no
*NL*
monument
to
the
man
she
is
proudest
of
;
no
monument
,
that
is
to
say
,
of
*NL*
him
;
for
the
bronze
statue
in
the
little
garden
of
the
Plaza
de
las
*NL*
Cortes
,
a
fair
work
of
art
no
doubt
,
and
unexceptionable
had
it
been
set
*NL*
up
to
the
local
poet
in
the
market-place
of
some
provincial
town
,
is
not
*NL*
worthy
of
Cervantes
or
of
Madrid
.
But
what
need
has
Cervantes
of
``
such
*NL*
weak
witness
of
his
name
;
''
or
what
could
a
monument
do
in
his
case
except
*NL*
testify
to
the
self-glorification
of
those
who
had
put
it
up
?
Si
*NL*
monumentum
quoeris
,
circumspice
.
The
nearest
bookseller
's
shop
will
show
*NL*
what
bathos
there
would
be
in
a
monument
to
the
author
of
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nine
editions
of
the
First
Part
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
had
already
appeared
*NL*
before
Cervantes
died
,
thirty
thousand
copies
in
all
,
according
to
his
*NL*
own
estimate
,
and
a
tenth
was
printed
at
Barcelona
the
year
after
his
*NL*
death
.
So
large
a
number
naturally
supplied
the
demand
for
some
time
,
but
*NL*
by
1634
it
appears
to
have
been
exhausted
;
and
from
that
time
down
to
the
*NL*
present
day
the
stream
of
editions
has
continued
to
flow
rapidly
and
*NL*
regularly
.
The
translations
show
still
more
clearly
in
what
request
the
*NL*
book
has
been
from
the
very
outset
.
In
seven
years
from
the
completion
of
*NL*
the
work
it
had
been
translated
into
the
four
leading
languages
of
*NL*
Europe
.
Except
the
Bible
,
in
fact
,
no
book
has
been
so
widely
diffused
as
*NL*
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
The
``
Imitatio
Christi
''
may
have
been
translated
into
as
*NL*
many
different
languages
,
and
perhaps
``
Robinson
Crusoe
''
and
the
``
Vicar
of
*NL*
Wakefield
''
into
nearly
as
many
,
but
in
multiplicity
of
translations
and
*NL*
editions
``
Don
Quixote
''
leaves
them
all
far
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
more
remarkable
is
the
character
of
this
wide
diffusion
.
``
Don
*NL*
Quixote
''
has
been
thoroughly
naturalised
among
people
whose
ideas
about
*NL*
knight-errantry
,
if
they
had
any
at
all
,
were
of
the
vaguest
,
who
had
*NL*
never
seen
or
heard
of
a
book
of
chivalry
,
who
could
not
possibly
feel
*NL*
the
humour
of
the
burlesque
or
sympathise
with
the
author
's
purpose
.
*NL*
Another
curious
fact
is
that
this
,
the
most
cosmopolitan
book
in
the
*NL*
world
,
is
one
of
the
most
intensely
national
.
``
Manon
Lescaut
''
is
not
more
*NL*
thoroughly
French
,
``
Tom
Jones
''
not
more
English
,
``
Rob
Roy
''
not
more
*NL*
Scotch
,
than
``
Don
Quixote
''
is
Spanish
,
in
character
,
in
ideas
,
in
*NL*
sentiment
,
in
local
colour
,
in
everything
.
What
,
then
,
is
the
secret
of
*NL*
this
unparalleled
popularity
,
increasing
year
by
year
for
well-nigh
three
*NL*
centuries
?
One
explanation
,
no
doubt
,
is
that
of
all
the
books
in
the
*NL*
world
,
``
Don
Quixote
''
is
the
most
catholic
.
There
is
something
in
it
for
*NL*
every
sort
of
reader
,
young
or
old
,
sage
or
simple
,
high
or
low
.
As
*NL*
Cervantes
himself
says
with
a
touch
of
pride
,
``
It
is
thumbed
and
read
and
*NL*
got
by
heart
by
people
of
all
sorts
;
the
children
turn
its
leaves
,
the
*NL*
young
people
read
it
,
the
grown
men
understand
it
,
the
old
folk
praise
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
would
be
idle
to
deny
that
the
ingredient
which
,
more
than
its
*NL*
humour
,
or
its
wisdom
,
or
the
fertility
of
invention
or
knowledge
of
*NL*
human
nature
it
displays
,
has
insured
its
success
with
the
multitude
,
is
*NL*
the
vein
of
farce
that
runs
through
it
.
It
was
the
attack
upon
the
sheep
,
*NL*
the
battle
with
the
wine-skins
,
Mambrino
's
helmet
,
the
balsam
of
*NL*
Fierabras
,
Don
Quixote
knocked
over
by
the
sails
of
the
windmill
,
Sancho
*NL*
tossed
in
the
blanket
,
the
mishaps
and
misadventures
of
master
and
man
,
*NL*
that
were
originally
the
great
attraction
,
and
perhaps
are
so
still
to
*NL*
some
extent
with
the
majority
of
readers
.
It
is
plain
that
``
Don
Quixote
''
*NL*
was
generally
regarded
at
first
,
and
indeed
in
Spain
for
a
long
time
,
as
*NL*
little
more
than
a
queer
droll
book
,
full
of
laughable
incidents
and
*NL*
absurd
situations
,
very
amusing
,
but
not
entitled
to
much
consideration
*NL*
or
care
.
All
the
editions
printed
in
Spain
from
1637
to
1771
,
when
the
*NL*
famous
printer
Ibarra
took
it
up
,
were
mere
trade
editions
,
badly
and
*NL*
carelessly
printed
on
vile
paper
and
got
up
in
the
style
of
chap-books
*NL*
intended
only
for
popular
use
,
with
,
in
most
instances
,
uncouth
*NL*
illustrations
and
clap-trap
additions
by
the
publisher
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
England
belongs
the
credit
of
having
been
the
first
country
to
*NL*
recognise
the
right
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
to
better
treatment
than
this
.
The
*NL*
London
edition
of
1738
,
commonly
called
Lord
Carteret
's
from
having
been
*NL*
suggested
by
him
,
was
not
a
mere
edition
de
luxe
.
It
produced
``
Don
*NL*
Quixote
''
in
becoming
form
as
regards
paper
and
type
,
and
embellished
with
*NL*
plates
which
,
if
not
particularly
happy
as
illustrations
,
were
at
least
*NL*
well
intentioned
and
well
executed
,
but
it
also
aimed
at
correctness
of
*NL*
text
,
a
matter
to
which
nobody
except
the
editors
of
the
Valencia
and
*NL*
Brussels
editions
had
given
even
a
passing
thought
;
and
for
a
first
*NL*
attempt
it
was
fairly
successful
,
for
though
some
of
its
emendations
are
*NL*
inadmissible
,
a
good
many
of
them
have
been
adopted
by
all
subsequent
*NL*
editors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
zeal
of
publishers
,
editors
,
and
annotators
brought
about
a
*NL*
remarkable
change
of
sentiment
with
regard
to
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
A
vast
*NL*
number
of
its
admirers
began
to
grow
ashamed
of
laughing
over
it
.
It
*NL*
became
almost
a
crime
to
treat
it
as
a
humorous
book
.
The
humour
was
not
*NL*
entirely
denied
,
but
,
according
to
the
new
view
,
it
was
rated
as
an
*NL*
altogether
secondary
quality
,
a
mere
accessory
,
nothing
more
than
the
*NL*
stalking-horse
under
the
presentation
of
which
Cervantes
shot
his
*NL*
philosophy
or
his
satire
,
or
whatever
it
was
he
meant
to
shoot
;
for
on
*NL*
this
point
opinions
varied
.
All
were
agreed
,
however
,
that
the
object
he
*NL*
aimed
at
was
not
the
books
of
chivalry
.
He
said
emphatically
in
the
*NL*
preface
to
the
First
Part
and
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
Second
,
that
he
*NL*
had
no
other
object
in
view
than
to
discredit
these
books
,
and
this
,
to
*NL*
advanced
criticism
,
made
it
clear
that
his
object
must
have
been
*NL*
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
theory
was
that
the
book
was
a
kind
of
allegory
,
setting
forth
the
*NL*
eternal
struggle
between
the
ideal
and
the
real
,
between
the
spirit
of
*NL*
poetry
and
the
spirit
of
prose
;
and
perhaps
German
philosophy
never
*NL*
evolved
a
more
ungainly
or
unlikely
camel
out
of
the
depths
of
its
inner
*NL*
consciousness
.
Something
of
the
antagonism
,
no
doubt
,
is
to
be
found
in
*NL*
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
because
it
is
to
be
found
everywhere
in
life
,
and
*NL*
Cervantes
drew
from
life
.
It
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
community
in
which
*NL*
the
never-ceasing
game
of
cross-purposes
between
Sancho
Panza
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
would
not
be
recognized
as
true
to
nature
.
In
the
stone
age
,
*NL*
among
the
lake
dwellers
,
among
the
cave
men
,
there
were
Don
Quixotes
and
*NL*
Sancho
Panzas
;
there
must
have
been
the
troglodyte
who
never
could
see
*NL*
the
facts
before
his
eyes
,
and
the
troglodyte
who
could
see
nothing
else
.
*NL*
But
to
suppose
Cervantes
deliberately
setting
himself
to
expound
any
such
*NL*
idea
in
two
stout
quarto
volumes
is
to
suppose
something
not
only
very
*NL*
unlike
the
age
in
which
he
lived
,
but
altogether
unlike
Cervantes
*NL*
himself
,
who
would
have
been
the
first
to
laugh
at
an
attempt
of
the
sort
*NL*
made
by
anyone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
extraordinary
influence
of
the
romances
of
chivalry
in
his
day
is
*NL*
quite
enough
to
account
for
the
genesis
of
the
book
.
Some
idea
of
the
*NL*
prodigious
development
of
this
branch
of
literature
in
the
sixteenth
*NL*
century
may
be
obtained
from
the
scrutiny
of
Chapter
VII
,
if
the
reader
*NL*
bears
in
mind
that
only
a
portion
of
the
romances
belonging
to
by
far
the
*NL*
largest
group
are
enumerated
.
As
to
its
effect
upon
the
nation
,
there
is
*NL*
abundant
evidence
.
From
the
time
when
the
Amadises
and
Palmerins
began
to
*NL*
grow
popular
down
to
the
very
end
of
the
century
,
there
is
a
steady
*NL*
stream
of
invective
,
from
men
whose
character
and
position
lend
weight
to
*NL*
their
words
,
against
the
romances
of
chivalry
and
the
infatuation
of
*NL*
their
readers
.
Ridicule
was
the
only
besom
to
sweep
away
that
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
this
was
the
task
Cervantes
set
himself
,
and
that
he
had
ample
*NL*
provocation
to
urge
him
to
it
,
will
be
sufficiently
clear
to
those
who
*NL*
look
into
the
evidence
;
as
it
will
be
also
that
it
was
not
chivalry
*NL*
itself
that
he
attacked
and
swept
away
.
Of
all
the
absurdities
that
,
*NL*
thanks
to
poetry
,
will
be
repeated
to
the
end
of
time
,
there
is
no
*NL*
greater
one
than
saying
that
``
Cervantes
smiled
Spain
's
chivalry
away
.
''
In
*NL*
the
first
place
there
was
no
chivalry
for
him
to
smile
away
.
Spain
's
*NL*
chivalry
had
been
dead
for
more
than
a
century
.
Its
work
was
done
when
*NL*
Granada
fell
,
and
as
chivalry
was
essentially
republican
in
its
nature
,
*NL*
it
could
not
live
under
the
rule
that
Ferdinand
substituted
for
the
free
*NL*
institutions
of
mediaeval
Spain
.
What
he
did
smile
away
was
not
chivalry
*NL*
but
a
degrading
mockery
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
true
nature
of
the
``
right
arm
''
and
the
``
bright
array
,
''
before
which
,
*NL*
according
to
the
poet
,
``
the
world
gave
ground
,
''
and
which
Cervantes
'
*NL*
single
laugh
demolished
,
may
be
gathered
from
the
words
of
one
of
his
own
*NL*
countrymen
,
Don
Felix
Pacheco
,
as
reported
by
Captain
George
Carleton
,
in
*NL*
his
``
Military
Memoirs
from
1672
to
1713
.
''
``
Before
the
appearance
in
the
*NL*
world
of
that
labour
of
Cervantes
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
was
next
to
an
*NL*
impossibility
for
a
man
to
walk
the
streets
with
any
delight
or
without
*NL*
danger
.
There
were
seen
so
many
cavaliers
prancing
and
curvetting
before
*NL*
the
windows
of
their
mistresses
,
that
a
stranger
would
have
imagined
the
*NL*
whole
nation
to
have
been
nothing
less
than
a
race
of
knight-errants
.
But
*NL*
after
the
world
became
a
little
acquainted
with
that
notable
history
,
the
*NL*
man
that
was
seen
in
that
once
celebrated
drapery
was
pointed
at
as
a
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
and
found
himself
the
jest
of
high
and
low
.
And
I
verily
believe
*NL*
that
to
this
,
and
this
only
,
we
owe
that
dampness
and
poverty
of
spirit
*NL*
which
has
run
through
all
our
councils
for
a
century
past
,
so
little
*NL*
agreeable
to
those
nobler
actions
of
our
famous
ancestors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
call
``
Don
Quixote
''
a
sad
book
,
preaching
a
pessimist
view
of
life
,
*NL*
argues
a
total
misconception
of
its
drift
.
It
would
be
so
if
its
moral
*NL*
were
that
,
in
this
world
,
true
enthusiasm
naturally
leads
to
ridicule
and
*NL*
discomfiture
.
But
it
preaches
nothing
of
the
sort
;
its
moral
,
so
far
as
*NL*
it
can
be
said
to
have
one
,
is
that
the
spurious
enthusiasm
that
is
born
*NL*
of
vanity
and
self-conceit
,
that
is
made
an
end
in
itself
,
not
a
means
to
*NL*
an
end
,
that
acts
on
mere
impulse
,
regardless
of
circumstances
and
*NL*
consequences
,
is
mischievous
to
its
owner
,
and
a
very
considerable
*NL*
nuisance
to
the
community
at
large
.
To
those
who
can
not
distinguish
*NL*
between
the
one
kind
and
the
other
,
no
doubt
``
Don
Quixote
''
is
a
sad
book
;
*NL*
no
doubt
to
some
minds
it
is
very
sad
that
a
man
who
had
just
uttered
so
*NL*
beautiful
a
sentiment
as
that
``
it
is
a
hard
case
to
make
slaves
of
those
*NL*
whom
God
and
Nature
made
free
,
''
should
be
ungratefully
pelted
by
the
*NL*
scoundrels
his
crazy
philanthropy
had
let
loose
on
society
;
but
to
others
*NL*
of
a
more
judicial
cast
it
will
be
a
matter
of
regret
that
reckless
*NL*
self-sufficient
enthusiasm
is
not
oftener
requited
in
some
such
way
for
*NL*
all
the
mischief
it
does
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
slight
examination
of
the
structure
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
will
suffice
*NL*
to
show
that
Cervantes
had
no
deep
design
or
elaborate
plan
in
his
mind
*NL*
when
he
began
the
book
.
When
he
wrote
those
lines
in
which
``
with
a
few
*NL*
strokes
of
a
great
master
he
sets
before
us
the
pauper
gentleman
,
''
he
had
*NL*
no
idea
of
the
goal
to
which
his
imagination
was
leading
him
.
There
can
*NL*
be
little
doubt
that
all
he
contemplated
was
a
short
tale
to
range
with
*NL*
those
he
had
already
written
,
a
tale
setting
forth
the
ludicrous
results
*NL*
that
might
be
expected
to
follow
the
attempt
of
a
crazy
gentleman
to
act
*NL*
the
part
of
a
knight-errant
in
modern
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
plain
,
for
one
thing
,
that
Sancho
Panza
did
not
enter
into
the
*NL*
original
scheme
,
for
had
Cervantes
thought
of
him
he
certainly
would
not
*NL*
have
omitted
him
in
his
hero
's
outfit
,
which
he
obviously
meant
to
be
*NL*
complete
.
Him
we
owe
to
the
landlord
's
chance
remark
in
Chapter
III
that
*NL*
knights
seldom
travelled
without
squires
.
To
try
to
think
of
a
Don
*NL*
Quixote
without
Sancho
Panza
is
like
trying
to
think
of
a
one-bladed
pair
*NL*
of
scissors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
was
written
at
first
,
like
the
others
,
without
any
division
and
*NL*
without
the
intervention
of
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
;
and
it
seems
not
*NL*
unlikely
that
Cervantes
had
some
intention
of
bringing
Dulcinea
,
or
*NL*
Aldonza
Lorenzo
,
on
the
scene
in
person
.
It
was
probably
the
ransacking
*NL*
of
the
Don
's
library
and
the
discussion
on
the
books
of
chivalry
that
*NL*
first
suggested
it
to
him
that
his
idea
was
capable
of
development
.
What
,
*NL*
if
instead
of
a
mere
string
of
farcical
misadventures
,
he
were
to
make
*NL*
his
tale
a
burlesque
of
one
of
these
books
,
caricaturing
their
style
,
*NL*
incidents
,
and
spirit
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
of
this
change
of
plan
,
he
hastily
and
somewhat
clumsily
*NL*
divided
what
he
had
written
into
chapters
on
the
model
of
``
Amadis
,
''
*NL*
invented
the
fable
of
a
mysterious
Arabic
manuscript
,
and
set
up
Cide
*NL*
Hamete
Benengeli
in
imitation
of
the
almost
invariable
practice
of
the
*NL*
chivalry-romance
authors
,
who
were
fond
of
tracing
their
books
to
some
*NL*
recondite
source
.
In
working
out
the
new
ideas
,
he
soon
found
the
value
*NL*
of
Sancho
Panza
.
Indeed
,
the
keynote
,
not
only
to
Sancho
's
part
,
but
to
*NL*
the
whole
book
,
is
struck
in
the
first
words
Sancho
utters
when
he
*NL*
announces
his
intention
of
taking
his
ass
with
him
.
``
About
the
ass
,
''
we
*NL*
are
told
,
``
Don
Quixote
hesitated
a
little
,
trying
whether
he
could
call
*NL*
to
mind
any
knight-errant
taking
with
him
an
esquire
mounted
on
ass-back
;
*NL*
but
no
instance
occurred
to
his
memory
.
''
We
can
see
the
whole
scene
at
a
*NL*
glance
,
the
stolid
unconsciousness
of
Sancho
and
the
perplexity
of
his
*NL*
master
,
upon
whose
perception
the
incongruity
has
just
forced
itself
.
*NL*
This
is
Sancho
's
mission
throughout
the
book
;
he
is
an
unconscious
*NL*
Mephistopheles
,
always
unwittingly
making
mockery
of
his
master
's
*NL*
aspirations
,
always
exposing
the
fallacy
of
his
ideas
by
some
*NL*
unintentional
ad
absurdum
,
always
bringing
him
back
to
the
world
of
fact
*NL*
and
commonplace
by
force
of
sheer
stolidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
Cervantes
had
got
his
volume
of
novels
off
his
hands
,
and
*NL*
summoned
up
resolution
enough
to
set
about
the
Second
Part
in
earnest
,
*NL*
the
case
was
very
much
altered
.
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
Panza
had
not
*NL*
merely
found
favour
,
but
had
already
become
,
what
they
have
never
since
*NL*
ceased
to
be
,
veritable
entities
to
the
popular
imagination
.
There
was
no
*NL*
occasion
for
him
now
to
interpolate
extraneous
matter
;
nay
,
his
readers
*NL*
told
him
plainly
that
what
they
wanted
of
him
was
more
Don
Quixote
and
*NL*
more
Sancho
Panza
,
and
not
novels
,
tales
,
or
digressions
.
To
himself
,
*NL*
too
,
his
creations
had
become
realities
,
and
he
had
become
proud
of
them
,
*NL*
especially
of
Sancho
.
He
began
the
Second
Part
,
therefore
,
under
very
*NL*
different
conditions
,
and
the
difference
makes
itself
manifest
at
once
.
*NL*
Even
in
translation
the
style
will
be
seen
to
be
far
easier
,
more
*NL*
flowing
,
more
natural
,
and
more
like
that
of
a
man
sure
of
himself
and
of
*NL*
his
audience
.
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
undergo
a
change
also
.
In
the
First
*NL*
Part
,
Don
Quixote
has
no
character
or
individuality
whatever
.
He
is
*NL*
nothing
more
than
a
crazy
representative
of
the
sentiments
of
the
*NL*
chivalry
romances
.
In
all
that
he
says
and
does
he
is
simply
repeating
*NL*
the
lesson
he
has
learned
from
his
books
;
and
therefore
,
it
is
absurd
to
*NL*
speak
of
him
in
the
gushing
strain
of
the
sentimental
critics
when
they
*NL*
dilate
upon
his
nobleness
,
disinterestedness
,
dauntless
courage
,
and
so
*NL*
forth
.
It
was
the
business
of
a
knight-errant
to
right
wrongs
,
redress
*NL*
injuries
,
and
succour
the
distressed
,
and
this
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
he
*NL*
makes
his
business
when
he
takes
up
the
part
;
a
knight-errant
was
bound
*NL*
to
be
intrepid
,
and
so
he
feels
bound
to
cast
fear
aside
.
Of
all
Byron
's
*NL*
melodious
nonsense
about
Don
Quixote
,
the
most
nonsensical
statement
is
*NL*
that
''
'
t
is
his
virtue
makes
him
mad
!
''
The
exact
opposite
is
the
truth
;
*NL*
it
is
his
madness
makes
him
virtuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Second
Part
,
Cervantes
repeatedly
reminds
the
reader
,
as
if
it
was
*NL*
a
point
upon
which
he
was
anxious
there
should
be
no
mistake
,
that
his
*NL*
hero
's
madness
is
strictly
confined
to
delusions
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
chivalry
,
and
that
on
every
other
subject
he
is
discreto
,
one
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
whose
faculty
of
discernment
is
in
perfect
order
.
The
advantage
of
this
*NL*
is
that
he
is
enabled
to
make
use
of
Don
Quixote
as
a
mouthpiece
for
his
*NL*
own
reflections
,
and
so
,
without
seeming
to
digress
,
allow
himself
the
*NL*
relief
of
digression
when
he
requires
it
,
as
freely
as
in
a
commonplace
*NL*
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
the
amount
of
individuality
bestowed
upon
Don
Quixote
is
not
*NL*
very
great
.
There
are
some
natural
touches
of
character
about
him
,
such
*NL*
as
his
mixture
of
irascibility
and
placability
,
and
his
curious
affection
*NL*
for
Sancho
together
with
his
impatience
of
the
squire
's
loquacity
and
*NL*
impertinence
;
but
in
the
main
,
apart
from
his
craze
,
he
is
little
more
*NL*
than
a
thoughtful
,
cultured
gentleman
,
with
instinctive
good
taste
and
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
shrewdness
and
originality
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Sancho
,
it
is
plain
,
from
the
concluding
words
of
the
preface
to
*NL*
the
First
Part
,
that
he
was
a
favourite
with
his
creator
even
before
he
*NL*
had
been
taken
into
favour
by
the
public
.
An
inferior
genius
,
taking
him
*NL*
in
hand
a
second
time
,
would
very
likely
have
tried
to
improve
him
by
*NL*
making
him
more
comical
,
clever
,
amiable
,
or
virtuous
.
But
Cervantes
was
*NL*
too
true
an
artist
to
spoil
his
work
in
this
way
.
Sancho
,
when
he
*NL*
reappears
,
is
the
old
Sancho
with
the
old
familiar
features
;
but
with
a
*NL*
difference
;
they
have
been
brought
out
more
distinctly
,
but
at
the
same
*NL*
time
with
a
careful
avoidance
of
anything
like
caricature
;
the
outline
*NL*
has
been
filled
in
where
filling
in
was
necessary
,
and
,
vivified
by
a
few
*NL*
touches
of
a
master
's
hand
,
Sancho
stands
before
us
as
he
might
in
a
*NL*
character
portrait
by
Velazquez
.
He
is
a
much
more
important
and
*NL*
prominent
figure
in
the
Second
Part
than
in
the
First
;
indeed
,
it
is
his
*NL*
matchless
mendacity
about
Dulcinea
that
to
a
great
extent
supplies
the
*NL*
action
of
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
development
in
this
respect
is
as
remarkable
as
in
any
other
.
In
the
*NL*
First
Part
he
displays
a
great
natural
gift
of
lying
.
His
lies
are
not
of
*NL*
the
highly
imaginative
sort
that
liars
in
fiction
commonly
indulge
in
;
*NL*
like
Falstaff
's
,
they
resemble
the
father
that
begets
them
;
they
are
*NL*
simple
,
homely
,
plump
lies
;
plain
working
lies
,
in
short
.
But
in
the
*NL*
service
of
such
a
master
as
Don
Quixote
he
develops
rapidly
,
as
we
see
*NL*
when
he
comes
to
palm
off
the
three
country
wenches
as
Dulcinea
and
her
*NL*
ladies
in
waiting
.
It
is
worth
noticing
how
,
flushed
by
his
success
in
*NL*
this
instance
,
he
is
tempted
afterwards
to
try
a
flight
beyond
his
powers
*NL*
in
his
account
of
the
journey
on
Clavileno
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Second
Part
it
is
the
spirit
rather
than
the
incidents
of
the
*NL*
chivalry
romances
that
is
the
subject
of
the
burlesque
.
Enchantments
of
*NL*
the
sort
travestied
in
those
of
Dulcinea
and
the
Trifaldi
and
the
cave
of
*NL*
Montesinos
play
a
leading
part
in
the
later
and
inferior
romances
,
and
*NL*
another
distinguishing
feature
is
caricatured
in
Don
Quixote
's
blind
*NL*
adoration
of
Dulcinea
.
In
the
romances
of
chivalry
love
is
either
a
mere
*NL*
animalism
or
a
fantastic
idolatry
.
Only
a
coarse-minded
man
would
care
to
*NL*
make
merry
with
the
former
,
but
to
one
of
Cervantes
'
humour
the
latter
*NL*
was
naturally
an
attractive
subject
for
ridicule
.
Like
everything
else
in
*NL*
these
romances
,
it
is
a
gross
exaggeration
of
the
real
sentiment
of
*NL*
chivalry
,
but
its
peculiar
extravagance
is
probably
due
to
the
influence
*NL*
of
those
masters
of
hyperbole
,
the
Provencal
poets
.
When
a
troubadour
*NL*
professed
his
readiness
to
obey
his
lady
in
all
things
,
he
made
it
*NL*
incumbent
upon
the
next
comer
,
if
he
wished
to
avoid
the
imputation
of
*NL*
tameness
and
commonplace
,
to
declare
himself
the
slave
of
her
will
,
which
*NL*
the
next
was
compelled
to
cap
by
some
still
stronger
declaration
;
and
so
*NL*
expressions
of
devotion
went
on
rising
one
above
the
other
like
biddings
*NL*
at
an
auction
,
and
a
conventional
language
of
gallantry
and
theory
of
*NL*
love
came
into
being
that
in
time
permeated
the
literature
of
Southern
*NL*
Europe
,
and
bore
fruit
,
in
one
direction
in
the
transcendental
worship
of
*NL*
Beatrice
and
Laura
,
and
in
another
in
the
grotesque
idolatry
which
found
*NL*
exponents
in
writers
like
Feliciano
de
Silva
.
This
is
what
Cervantes
*NL*
deals
with
in
Don
Quixote
's
passion
for
Dulcinea
,
and
in
no
instance
has
*NL*
he
carried
out
the
burlesque
more
happily
.
By
keeping
Dulcinea
in
the
*NL*
background
,
and
making
her
a
vague
shadowy
being
of
whose
very
existence
*NL*
we
are
left
in
doubt
,
he
invests
Don
Quixote
's
worship
of
her
virtues
and
*NL*
charms
with
an
additional
extravagance
,
and
gives
still
more
point
to
the
*NL*
caricature
of
the
sentiment
and
language
of
the
romances
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
great
merits
of
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
and
one
of
the
qualities
that
*NL*
have
secured
its
acceptance
by
all
classes
of
readers
and
made
it
the
*NL*
most
cosmopolitan
of
books
,
is
its
simplicity
.
There
are
,
of
course
,
*NL*
points
obvious
enough
to
a
Spanish
seventeenth
century
audience
which
do
*NL*
not
immediately
strike
a
reader
now-a-days
,
and
Cervantes
often
takes
it
*NL*
for
granted
that
an
allusion
will
be
generally
understood
which
is
only
*NL*
intelligible
to
a
few
.
For
example
,
on
many
of
his
readers
in
Spain
,
and
*NL*
most
of
his
readers
out
of
it
,
the
significance
of
his
choice
of
a
*NL*
country
for
his
hero
is
completely
lost
.
It
would
be
going
too
far
to
say
*NL*
that
no
one
can
thoroughly
comprehend
``
Don
Quixote
''
without
having
seen
*NL*
La
Mancha
,
but
undoubtedly
even
a
glimpse
of
La
Mancha
will
give
an
*NL*
insight
into
the
meaning
of
Cervantes
such
as
no
commentator
can
give
.
Of
*NL*
all
the
regions
of
Spain
it
is
the
last
that
would
suggest
the
idea
of
*NL*
romance
.
Of
all
the
dull
central
plateau
of
the
Peninsula
it
is
the
*NL*
dullest
tract
.
There
is
something
impressive
about
the
grim
solitudes
of
*NL*
Estremadura
;
and
if
the
plains
of
Leon
and
Old
Castile
are
bald
and
*NL*
dreary
,
they
are
studded
with
old
cities
renowned
in
history
and
rich
in
*NL*
relics
of
the
past
.
But
there
is
no
redeeming
feature
in
the
Manchegan
*NL*
landscape
;
it
has
all
the
sameness
of
the
desert
without
its
dignity
;
the
*NL*
few
towns
and
villages
that
break
its
monotony
are
mean
and
commonplace
,
*NL*
there
is
nothing
venerable
about
them
,
they
have
not
even
the
*NL*
picturesqueness
of
poverty
;
indeed
,
Don
Quixote
's
own
village
,
*NL*
Argamasilla
,
has
a
sort
of
oppressive
respectability
in
the
prim
*NL*
regularity
of
its
streets
and
houses
;
everything
is
ignoble
;
the
very
*NL*
windmills
are
the
ugliest
and
shabbiest
of
the
windmill
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
anyone
who
knew
the
country
well
,
the
mere
style
and
title
of
``
Don
*NL*
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
''
gave
the
key
to
the
author
's
meaning
at
once
.
La
*NL*
Mancha
as
the
knight
's
country
and
scene
of
his
chivalries
is
of
a
piece
*NL*
with
the
pasteboard
helmet
,
the
farm-labourer
on
ass-back
for
a
squire
,
*NL*
knighthood
conferred
by
a
rascally
ventero
,
convicts
taken
for
victims
of
*NL*
oppression
,
and
the
rest
of
the
incongruities
between
Don
Quixote
's
world
*NL*
and
the
world
he
lived
in
,
between
things
as
he
saw
them
and
things
as
*NL*
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
strange
that
this
element
of
incongruity
,
underlying
the
whole
*NL*
humour
and
purpose
of
the
book
,
should
have
been
so
little
heeded
by
the
*NL*
majority
of
those
who
have
undertaken
to
interpret
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
It
has
*NL*
been
completely
overlooked
,
for
example
,
by
the
illustrators
.
To
be
sure
,
*NL*
the
great
majority
of
the
artists
who
illustrated
``
Don
Quixote
''
knew
*NL*
nothing
whatever
of
Spain
.
To
them
a
venta
conveyed
no
idea
but
the
*NL*
abstract
one
of
a
roadside
inn
,
and
they
could
not
therefore
do
full
*NL*
justice
to
the
humour
of
Don
Quixote
's
misconception
in
taking
it
for
a
*NL*
castle
,
or
perceive
the
remoteness
of
all
its
realities
from
his
ideal
.
*NL*
But
even
when
better
informed
they
seem
to
have
no
apprehension
of
the
*NL*
full
force
of
the
discrepancy
.
Take
,
for
instance
,
Gustave
Dore
's
drawing
*NL*
of
Don
Quixote
watching
his
armour
in
the
inn-yard
.
Whether
or
not
the
*NL*
Venta
de
Quesada
on
the
Seville
road
is
,
as
tradition
maintains
,
the
inn
*NL*
described
in
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
beyond
all
question
it
was
just
such
an
*NL*
inn-yard
as
the
one
behind
it
that
Cervantes
had
in
his
mind
's
eye
,
and
*NL*
it
was
on
just
such
a
rude
stone
trough
as
that
beside
the
primitive
*NL*
draw-well
in
the
corner
that
he
meant
Don
Quixote
to
deposit
his
armour
.
*NL*
Gustave
Dore
makes
it
an
elaborate
fountain
such
as
no
arriero
ever
*NL*
watered
his
mules
at
in
the
corral
of
any
venta
in
Spain
,
and
thereby
*NL*
entirely
misses
the
point
aimed
at
by
Cervantes
.
It
is
the
mean
,
prosaic
,
*NL*
commonplace
character
of
all
the
surroundings
and
circumstances
that
*NL*
gives
a
significance
to
Don
Quixote
's
vigil
and
the
ceremony
that
*NL*
follows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cervantes
'
humour
is
for
the
most
part
of
that
broader
and
simpler
sort
,
*NL*
the
strength
of
which
lies
in
the
perception
of
the
incongruous
.
It
is
*NL*
the
incongruity
of
Sancho
in
all
his
ways
,
words
,
and
works
,
with
the
*NL*
ideas
and
aims
of
his
master
,
quite
as
much
as
the
wonderful
vitality
and
*NL*
truth
to
nature
of
the
character
,
that
makes
him
the
most
humorous
*NL*
creation
in
the
whole
range
of
fiction
.
That
unsmiling
gravity
of
which
*NL*
Cervantes
was
the
first
great
master
,
``
Cervantes
'
serious
air
,
''
which
*NL*
sits
naturally
on
Swift
alone
,
perhaps
,
of
later
humourists
,
is
essential
*NL*
to
this
kind
of
humour
,
and
here
again
Cervantes
has
suffered
at
the
*NL*
hands
of
his
interpreters
.
Nothing
,
unless
indeed
the
coarse
buffoonery
*NL*
of
Phillips
,
could
be
more
out
of
place
in
an
attempt
to
represent
*NL*
Cervantes
,
than
a
flippant
,
would-be
facetious
style
,
like
that
of
*NL*
Motteux
's
version
for
example
,
or
the
sprightly
,
jaunty
air
,
French
*NL*
translators
sometimes
adopt
.
It
is
the
grave
matter-of-factness
of
the
*NL*
narrative
,
and
the
apparent
unconsciousness
of
the
author
that
he
is
*NL*
saying
anything
ludicrous
,
anything
but
the
merest
commonplace
,
that
give
*NL*
its
peculiar
flavour
to
the
humour
of
Cervantes
.
His
,
in
fact
,
is
the
*NL*
exact
opposite
of
the
humour
of
Sterne
and
the
self-conscious
humourists
.
*NL*
Even
when
Uncle
Toby
is
at
his
best
,
you
are
always
aware
of
``
the
man
*NL*
Sterne
''
behind
him
,
watching
you
over
his
shoulder
to
see
what
effect
he
*NL*
is
producing
.
Cervantes
always
leaves
you
alone
with
Don
Quixote
and
*NL*
Sancho
.
He
and
Swift
and
the
great
humourists
always
keep
themselves
out
*NL*
of
sight
,
or
,
more
properly
speaking
,
never
think
about
themselves
at
*NL*
all
,
unlike
our
latter-day
school
of
humourists
,
who
seem
to
have
revived
*NL*
the
old
horse-collar
method
,
and
try
to
raise
a
laugh
by
some
grotesque
*NL*
assumption
of
ignorance
,
imbecility
,
or
bad
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
to
do
full
justice
to
Spanish
humour
in
any
other
*NL*
language
is
well-nigh
an
impossibility
.
There
is
a
natural
gravity
and
a
*NL*
sonorous
stateliness
about
Spanish
,
be
it
ever
so
colloquial
,
that
make
*NL*
an
absurdity
doubly
absurd
,
and
give
plausibility
to
the
most
*NL*
preposterous
statement
.
This
is
what
makes
Sancho
Panza
's
drollery
the
*NL*
despair
of
the
conscientious
translator
.
Sancho
's
curt
comments
can
never
*NL*
fall
flat
,
but
they
lose
half
their
flavour
when
transferred
from
their
*NL*
native
Castilian
into
any
other
medium
.
But
if
foreigners
have
failed
to
*NL*
do
justice
to
the
humour
of
Cervantes
,
they
are
no
worse
than
his
own
*NL*
countrymen
.
Indeed
,
were
it
not
for
the
Spanish
peasant
's
relish
of
``
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
''
one
might
be
tempted
to
think
that
the
great
humourist
was
not
*NL*
looked
upon
as
a
humourist
at
all
in
his
own
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
craze
of
Don
Quixote
seems
,
in
some
instances
,
to
have
communicated
*NL*
itself
to
his
critics
,
making
them
see
things
that
are
not
in
the
book
*NL*
and
run
full
tilt
at
phantoms
that
have
no
existence
save
in
their
own
*NL*
imaginations
.
Like
a
good
many
critics
now-a-days
,
they
forget
that
*NL*
screams
are
not
criticism
,
and
that
it
is
only
vulgar
tastes
that
are
*NL*
influenced
by
strings
of
superlatives
,
three-piled
hyperboles
,
and
*NL*
pompous
epithets
.
But
what
strikes
one
as
particularly
strange
is
that
*NL*
while
they
deal
in
extravagant
eulogies
,
and
ascribe
all
manner
of
*NL*
imaginary
ideas
and
qualities
to
Cervantes
,
they
show
no
perception
of
*NL*
the
quality
that
ninety-nine
out
of
a
hundred
of
his
readers
would
rate
*NL*
highest
in
him
,
and
hold
to
be
the
one
that
raises
him
above
all
rivalry
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
speak
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
as
if
it
were
merely
a
humorous
book
would
be
a
*NL*
manifest
misdescription
.
Cervantes
at
times
makes
it
a
kind
of
*NL*
commonplace
book
for
occasional
essays
and
criticisms
,
or
for
the
*NL*
observations
and
reflections
and
gathered
wisdom
of
a
long
and
stirring
*NL*
life
.
It
is
a
mine
of
shrewd
observation
on
mankind
and
human
nature
.
*NL*
Among
modern
novels
there
may
be
,
here
and
there
,
more
elaborate
studies
*NL*
of
character
,
but
there
is
no
book
richer
in
individualised
character
.
*NL*
What
Coleridge
said
of
Shakespeare
in
minimis
is
true
of
Cervantes
;
he
*NL*
never
,
even
for
the
most
temporary
purpose
,
puts
forward
a
lay
figure
.
*NL*
There
is
life
and
individuality
in
all
his
characters
,
however
little
*NL*
they
may
have
to
do
,
or
however
short
a
time
they
may
be
before
the
*NL*
reader
.
Samson
Carrasco
,
the
curate
,
Teresa
Panza
,
Altisidora
,
even
the
*NL*
two
students
met
on
the
road
to
the
cave
of
Montesinos
,
all
live
and
move
*NL*
and
have
their
being
;
and
it
is
characteristic
of
the
broad
humanity
of
*NL*
Cervantes
that
there
is
not
a
hateful
one
among
them
all
.
Even
poor
*NL*
Maritornes
,
with
her
deplorable
morals
,
has
a
kind
heart
of
her
own
and
*NL*
``
some
faint
and
distant
resemblance
to
a
Christian
about
her
;
''
and
as
for
*NL*
Sancho
,
though
on
dissection
we
fail
to
find
a
lovable
trait
in
him
,
*NL*
unless
it
be
a
sort
of
dog-like
affection
for
his
master
,
who
is
there
*NL*
that
in
his
heart
does
not
love
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
,
after
all
,
the
humour
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
that
distinguishes
it
*NL*
from
all
other
books
of
the
romance
kind
.
It
is
this
that
makes
it
,
as
*NL*
one
of
the
most
judicial-minded
of
modern
critics
calls
it
,
``
the
best
*NL*
novel
in
the
world
beyond
all
comparison
.
''
It
is
its
varied
humour
,
*NL*
ranging
from
broad
farce
to
comedy
as
subtle
as
Shakespeare
's
or
*NL*
Moliere
's
that
has
naturalised
it
in
every
country
where
there
are
*NL*
readers
,
and
made
it
a
classic
in
every
language
that
has
a
literature
.

I
pine

THE
AUTHOR
'S
PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
Idle
reader
:
thou
mayest
believe
me
without
any
oath
that
I
would
this
*NL*
book
,
as
it
is
the
child
of
my
brain
,
were
the
fairest
,
gayest
,
and
*NL*
cleverest
that
could
be
imagined
.
But
I
could
not
counteract
Nature
's
law
*NL*
that
everything
shall
beget
its
like
;
and
what
,
then
,
could
this
sterile
,
*NL*
illtilled
wit
of
mine
beget
but
the
story
of
a
dry
,
shrivelled
,
whimsical
*NL*
offspring
,
full
of
thoughts
of
all
sorts
and
such
as
never
came
into
any
*NL*
other
imagination
--
just
what
might
be
begotten
in
a
prison
,
where
every
*NL*
misery
is
lodged
and
every
doleful
sound
makes
its
dwelling
?
*NL*
Tranquillity
,
a
cheerful
retreat
,
pleasant
fields
,
bright
skies
,
*NL*
murmuring
brooks
,
peace
of
mind
,
these
are
the
things
that
go
far
to
make
*NL*
even
the
most
barren
muses
fertile
,
and
bring
into
the
world
births
that
*NL*
fill
it
with
wonder
and
delight
.
Sometimes
when
a
father
has
an
ugly
,
*NL*
loutish
son
,
the
love
he
bears
him
so
blindfolds
his
eyes
that
he
does
*NL*
not
see
his
defects
,
or
,
rather
,
takes
them
for
gifts
and
charms
of
mind
*NL*
and
body
,
and
talks
of
them
to
his
friends
as
wit
and
grace
.
I
,
*NL*
however
--
for
though
I
pass
for
the
father
,
I
am
but
the
stepfather
to
*NL*
``
Don
Quixote
''
--
have
no
desire
to
go
with
the
current
of
custom
,
or
to
*NL*
implore
thee
,
dearest
reader
,
almost
with
tears
in
my
eyes
,
as
others
do
,
*NL*
to
pardon
or
excuse
the
defects
thou
wilt
perceive
in
this
child
of
mine
.
*NL*
Thou
art
neither
its
kinsman
nor
its
friend
,
thy
soul
is
thine
own
and
*NL*
thy
will
as
free
as
any
man
's
,
whate'er
he
be
,
thou
art
in
thine
own
*NL*
house
and
master
of
it
as
much
as
the
king
of
his
taxes
and
thou
knowest
*NL*
the
common
saying
,
``
Under
my
cloak
I
kill
the
king
;
''
all
which
exempts
*NL*
and
frees
thee
from
every
consideration
and
obligation
,
and
thou
canst
*NL*
say
what
thou
wilt
of
the
story
without
fear
of
being
abused
for
any
ill
*NL*
or
rewarded
for
any
good
thou
mayest
say
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
wish
would
be
simply
to
present
it
to
thee
plain
and
unadorned
,
*NL*
without
any
embellishment
of
preface
or
uncountable
muster
of
customary
*NL*
sonnets
,
epigrams
,
and
eulogies
,
such
as
are
commonly
put
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
books
.
For
I
can
tell
thee
,
though
composing
it
cost
me
some
*NL*
labour
,
I
found
none
greater
than
the
making
of
this
Preface
thou
art
now
*NL*
reading
.
Many
times
did
I
take
up
my
pen
to
write
it
,
and
many
did
I
lay
*NL*
it
down
again
,
not
knowing
what
to
write
.
One
of
these
times
,
as
I
was
*NL*
pondering
with
the
paper
before
me
,
a
pen
in
my
ear
,
my
elbow
on
the
*NL*
desk
,
and
my
cheek
in
my
hand
,
thinking
of
what
I
should
say
,
there
came
*NL*
in
unexpectedly
a
certain
lively
,
clever
friend
of
mine
,
who
,
seeing
me
*NL*
so
deep
in
thought
,
asked
the
reason
;
to
which
I
,
making
no
mystery
of
*NL*
it
,
answered
that
I
was
thinking
of
the
Preface
I
had
to
make
for
the
*NL*
story
of
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
which
so
troubled
me
that
I
had
a
mind
not
to
*NL*
make
any
at
all
,
nor
even
publish
the
achievements
of
so
noble
a
knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
,
how
could
you
expect
me
not
to
feel
uneasy
about
what
that
ancient
*NL*
lawgiver
they
call
the
Public
will
say
when
it
sees
me
,
after
slumbering
*NL*
so
many
years
in
the
silence
of
oblivion
,
coming
out
now
with
all
my
*NL*
years
upon
my
back
,
and
with
a
book
as
dry
as
a
rush
,
devoid
of
*NL*
invention
,
meagre
in
style
,
poor
in
thoughts
,
wholly
wanting
in
learning
*NL*
and
wisdom
,
without
quotations
in
the
margin
or
annotations
at
the
end
,
*NL*
after
the
fashion
of
other
books
I
see
,
which
,
though
all
fables
and
*NL*
profanity
,
are
so
full
of
maxims
from
Aristotle
,
and
Plato
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
herd
of
philosophers
,
that
they
fill
the
readers
with
amazement
and
*NL*
convince
them
that
the
authors
are
men
of
learning
,
erudition
,
and
*NL*
eloquence
.
And
then
,
when
they
quote
the
Holy
Scriptures
!
--
anyone
would
*NL*
say
they
are
St.
Thomases
or
other
doctors
of
the
Church
,
observing
as
*NL*
they
do
a
decorum
so
ingenious
that
in
one
sentence
they
describe
a
*NL*
distracted
lover
and
in
the
next
deliver
a
devout
little
sermon
that
it
*NL*
is
a
pleasure
and
a
treat
to
hear
and
read
.
Of
all
this
there
will
be
*NL*
nothing
in
my
book
,
for
I
have
nothing
to
quote
in
the
margin
or
to
note
*NL*
at
the
end
,
and
still
less
do
I
know
what
authors
I
follow
in
it
,
to
*NL*
place
them
at
the
beginning
,
as
all
do
,
under
the
letters
A
,
B
,
C
,
*NL*
beginning
with
Aristotle
and
ending
with
Xenophon
,
or
Zoilus
,
or
Zeuxis
,
*NL*
though
one
was
a
slanderer
and
the
other
a
painter
.
Also
my
book
must
do
*NL*
without
sonnets
at
the
beginning
,
at
least
sonnets
whose
authors
are
*NL*
dukes
,
marquises
,
counts
,
bishops
,
ladies
,
or
famous
poets
.
Though
if
I
*NL*
were
to
ask
two
or
three
obliging
friends
,
I
know
they
would
give
me
*NL*
them
,
and
such
as
the
productions
of
those
that
have
the
highest
*NL*
reputation
in
our
Spain
could
not
equal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
my
friend
,
''
I
continued
,
``
I
am
determined
that
Senor
Don
*NL*
Quixote
shall
remain
buried
in
the
archives
of
his
own
La
Mancha
until
*NL*
Heaven
provide
some
one
to
garnish
him
with
all
those
things
he
stands
in
*NL*
need
of
;
because
I
find
myself
,
through
my
shallowness
and
want
of
*NL*
learning
,
unequal
to
supplying
them
,
and
because
I
am
by
nature
shy
and
*NL*
careless
about
hunting
for
authors
to
say
what
I
myself
can
say
without
*NL*
them
.
Hence
the
cogitation
and
abstraction
you
found
me
in
,
and
reason
*NL*
enough
,
what
you
have
heard
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
,
my
friend
,
giving
himself
a
slap
on
the
forehead
and
*NL*
breaking
into
a
hearty
laugh
,
exclaimed
,
``
Before
God
,
Brother
,
now
am
I
*NL*
disabused
of
an
error
in
which
I
have
been
living
all
this
long
time
I
*NL*
have
known
you
,
all
through
which
I
have
taken
you
to
be
shrewd
and
*NL*
sensible
in
all
you
do
;
but
now
I
see
you
are
as
far
from
that
as
the
*NL*
heaven
is
from
the
earth
.
It
is
possible
that
things
of
so
little
moment
*NL*
and
so
easy
to
set
right
can
occupy
and
perplex
a
ripe
wit
like
yours
,
*NL*
fit
to
break
through
and
crush
far
greater
obstacles
?
By
my
faith
,
this
*NL*
comes
,
not
of
any
want
of
ability
,
but
of
too
much
indolence
and
too
*NL*
little
knowledge
of
life
.
Do
you
want
to
know
if
I
am
telling
the
truth
?
*NL*
Well
,
then
,
attend
to
me
,
and
you
will
see
how
,
in
the
opening
and
*NL*
shutting
of
an
eye
,
I
sweep
away
all
your
difficulties
,
and
supply
all
*NL*
those
deficiencies
which
you
say
check
and
discourage
you
from
bringing
*NL*
before
the
world
the
story
of
your
famous
Don
Quixote
,
the
light
and
*NL*
mirror
of
all
knight-errantry
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

said
I
,
listening
to
his
talk
;
``
how
do
you
propose
to
make
up

my
diffidence
,
and
reduce
to
order
this
chaos

I
am

,
you
have
a
grand
note
,
for
you
can
put
--
The
giant
Golias
*NL*
or
Goliath
was
a
Philistine
whom
the
shepherd
David
slew
by
a
mighty
*NL*
stone-cast
in
the
Terebinth
valley
,
as
is
related
in
the
Book
of
*NL*
Kings
--
in
the
chapter
where
you
find
it
written
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
,
to
prove
yourself
a
man
of
erudition
in
polite
literature
and
*NL*
cosmography
,
manage
that
the
river
Tagus
shall
be
named
in
your
story
,
*NL*
and
there
you
are
at
once
with
another
famous
annotation
,
setting
*NL*
forth
--
The
river
Tagus
was
so
called
after
a
King
of
Spain
:
it
has
its
*NL*
source
in
such
and
such
a
place
and
falls
into
the
ocean
,
kissing
the
*NL*
walls
of
the
famous
city
of
Lisbon
,
and
it
is
a
common
belief
that
it
has
*NL*
golden
sands
,
etc.
.
If
you
should
have
anything
to
do
with
robbers
,
I
will
*NL*
give
you
the
story
of
Cacus
,
for
I
have
it
by
heart
;
if
with
loose
women
,
*NL*
there
is
the
Bishop
of
Mondonedo
,
who
will
give
you
the
loan
of
Lamia
,
*NL*
Laida
,
and
Flora
,
any
reference
to
whom
will
bring
you
great
credit
;
if
*NL*
with
hard-hearted
ones
,
Ovid
will
furnish
you
with
Medea
;
if
with
witches
*NL*
or
enchantresses
,
Homer
has
Calypso
,
and
Virgil
Circe
;
if
with
valiant
*NL*
captains
,
Julius
Caesar
himself
will
lend
you
himself
in
his
own
*NL*
`
Commentaries
,
'
and
Plutarch
will
give
you
a
thousand
Alexanders
.
If
you
*NL*
should
deal
with
love
,
with
two
ounces
you
may
know
of
Tuscan
you
can
go
*NL*
to
Leon
the
Hebrew
,
who
will
supply
you
to
your
heart
's
content
;
or
if
*NL*
you
should
not
care
to
go
to
foreign
countries
you
have
at
home
Fonseca
's
*NL*
`
Of
the
Love
of
God
,
'
in
which
is
condensed
all
that
you
or
the
most
*NL*
imaginative
mind
can
want
on
the
subject
.
In
short
,
all
you
have
to
do
is
*NL*
to
manage
to
quote
these
names
,
or
refer
to
these
stories
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
,
and
leave
it
to
me
to
insert
the
annotations
and
quotations
,
*NL*
and
I
swear
by
all
that
's
good
to
fill
your
margins
and
use
up
four
*NL*
sheets
at
the
end
of
the
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
us
come
to
those
references
to
authors
which
other
books
have
,
*NL*
and
you
want
for
yours
.
The
remedy
for
this
is
very
simple
:
You
have
only
*NL*
to
look
out
for
some
book
that
quotes
them
all
,
from
A
to
Z
as
you
say
*NL*
yourself
,
and
then
insert
the
very
same
alphabet
in
your
book
,
and
though
*NL*
the
imposition
may
be
plain
to
see
,
because
you
have
so
little
need
to
*NL*
borrow
from
them
,
that
is
no
matter
;
there
will
probably
be
some
simple
*NL*
enough
to
believe
that
you
have
made
use
of
them
all
in
this
plain
,
*NL*
artless
story
of
yours
.
At
any
rate
,
if
it
answers
no
other
purpose
,
this
*NL*
long
catalogue
of
authors
will
serve
to
give
a
surprising
look
of
*NL*
authority
to
your
book
.
Besides
,
no
one
will
trouble
himself
to
verify
*NL*
whether
you
have
followed
them
or
whether
you
have
not
,
being
no
way
*NL*
concerned
in
it
;
especially
as
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
this
book
of
yours
has
*NL*
no
need
of
any
one
of
those
things
you
say
it
wants
,
for
it
is
,
from
*NL*
beginning
to
end
,
an
attack
upon
the
books
of
chivalry
,
of
which
*NL*
Aristotle
never
dreamt
,
nor
St.
Basil
said
a
word
,
nor
Cicero
had
any
*NL*
knowledge
;
nor
do
the
niceties
of
truth
nor
the
observations
of
astrology
*NL*
come
within
the
range
of
its
fanciful
vagaries
;
nor
have
geometrical
*NL*
measurements
or
refutations
of
the
arguments
used
in
rhetoric
anything
to
*NL*
do
with
it
;
nor
does
it
mean
to
preach
to
anybody
,
mixing
up
things
human
*NL*
and
divine
,
a
sort
of
motley
in
which
no
Christian
understanding
should
*NL*
dress
itself
.
It
has
only
to
avail
itself
of
truth
to
nature
in
its
*NL*
composition
,
and
the
more
perfect
the
imitation
the
better
the
work
will
*NL*
be
.
And
as
this
piece
of
yours
aims
at
nothing
more
than
to
destroy
the
*NL*
authority
and
influence
which
books
of
chivalry
have
in
the
world
and
*NL*
with
the
public
,
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
go
a-begging
for
aphorisms
*NL*
from
philosophers
,
precepts
from
Holy
Scripture
,
fables
from
poets
,
*NL*
speeches
from
orators
,
or
miracles
from
saints
;
but
merely
to
take
care
*NL*
that
your
style
and
diction
run
musically
,
pleasantly
,
and
plainly
,
with
*NL*
clear
,
proper
,
and
well-placed
words
,
setting
forth
your
purpose
to
the
*NL*
best
of
your
power
,
and
putting
your
ideas
intelligibly
,
without
*NL*
confusion
or
obscurity
.
Strive
,
too
,
that
in
reading
your
story
the
*NL*
melancholy
may
be
moved
to
laughter
,
and
the
merry
made
merrier
still
;
*NL*
that
the
simple
shall
not
be
wearied
,
that
the
judicious
shall
admire
the
*NL*
invention
,
that
the
grave
shall
not
despise
it
,
nor
the
wise
fail
to
*NL*
praise
it
.
Finally
,
keep
your
aim
fixed
on
the
destruction
of
that
*NL*
ill-founded
edifice
of
the
books
of
chivalry
,
hated
by
some
and
praised
*NL*
by
many
more
;
for
if
you
succeed
in
this
you
will
have
achieved
no
small
*NL*
success
.

In
profound
silence
I
listened
to
what
my
friend
said
,
and
his
*NL*
observations
made
such
an
impression
on
me
that
,
without
attempting
to
*NL*
question
them
,
I
admitted
their
soundness
,
and
out
of
them
I
determined
*NL*
to
make
this
Preface
;
wherein
,
gentle
reader
,
thou
wilt
perceive
my
*NL*
friend
's
good
sense
,
my
good
fortune
in
finding
such
an
adviser
in
such
a
*NL*
time
of
need
,
and
what
thou
hast
gained
in
receiving
,
without
addition
or
*NL*
alteration
,
the
story
of
the
famous
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
who
is
held
*NL*
by
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
of
the
Campo
de
Montiel
to
have
*NL*
been
the
chastest
lover
and
the
bravest
knight
that
has
for
many
years
*NL*
been
seen
in
that
neighbourhood
.
I
have
no
desire
to
magnify
the
service
*NL*
I
render
thee
in
making
thee
acquainted
with
so
renowned
and
honoured
a
*NL*
knight
,
but
I
do
desire
thy
thanks
for
the
acquaintance
thou
wilt
make
*NL*
with
the
famous
Sancho
Panza
,
his
squire
,
in
whom
,
to
my
thinking
,
I
have
*NL*
given
thee
condensed
all
the
squirely
drolleries
that
are
scattered
*NL*
through
the
swarm
of
the
vain
books
of
chivalry
.
And
so
--
may
God
give
*NL*
thee
health
,
and
not
forget
me

In

on

as

chiefly
*NL*
those
who
by
their
nobleness
do
not
submit
to
the
service
and
bribery
of
*NL*
the
vulgar
,
I
have
determined
bringing
to
light
The
Ingenious

Don

in
shelter
of
Your

,
with
the
obeisance
I
owe
to
such
grandeur
,
I
pray
to
receive
it
*NL*
agreeably
under
his
protection
,
so
that
in

shadow
,
though
deprived
*NL*
of
that
precious
ornament
of
elegance
and
erudition
that
clothe
the
works
*NL*
composed
in
the
houses
of
those
who
know
,
it
dares
appear
with
assurance
*NL*
in
the
judgment
of
some
who
,
trespassing
the
bounds
of
their
own
*NL*
ignorance
,
use
to
condemn
with
more
rigour
and
less
justice
the
writings
*NL*
of
others
.
It
is
my
earnest
hope
that
Your
Excellency
's
good
counsel
in
*NL*
regard
to
my
honourable
purpose
,
will
not
disdain
the
littleness
of
so
*NL*
humble
a
service
.

CHAPTER
I.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
THE
CHARACTER
AND
PURSUITS
OF
THE
FAMOUS
GENTLEMAN
DON
*NL*
QUIXOTE
OF
LA
MANCHA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
village
of
La
Mancha
,
the
name
of
which
I
have
no
desire
to
call
to
*NL*
mind
,
there
lived
not
long
since
one
of
those
gentlemen
that
keep
a
lance
*NL*
in
the
lance-rack
,
an
old
buckler
,
a
lean
hack
,
and
a
greyhound
for
*NL*
coursing
.
An
olla
of
rather
more
beef
than
mutton
,
a
salad
on
most
*NL*
nights
,
scraps
on
Saturdays
,
lentils
on
Fridays
,
and
a
pigeon
or
so
extra
*NL*
on
Sundays
,
made
away
with
three-quarters
of
his
income
.
The
rest
of
it
*NL*
went
in
a
doublet
of
fine
cloth
and
velvet
breeches
and
shoes
to
match
*NL*
for
holidays
,
while
on
week-days
he
made
a
brave
figure
in
his
best
*NL*
homespun
.
He
had
in
his
house
a
housekeeper
past
forty
,
a
niece
under
*NL*
twenty
,
and
a
lad
for
the
field
and
market-place
,
who
used
to
saddle
the
*NL*
hack
as
well
as
handle
the
bill-hook
.
The
age
of
this
gentleman
of
ours
*NL*
was
bordering
on
fifty
;
he
was
of
a
hardy
habit
,
spare
,
gaunt-featured
,
a
*NL*
very
early
riser
and
a
great
sportsman
.
They
will
have
it
his
surname
was
*NL*
Quixada
or
Quesada
-LRB-
for
here
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
among
*NL*
the
authors
who
write
on
the
subject
-RRB-
,
although
from
reasonable
*NL*
conjectures
it
seems
plain
that
he
was
called
Quexana
.
This
,
however
,
is
*NL*
of
but
little
importance
to
our
tale
;
it
will
be
enough
not
to
stray
a
*NL*
hair
's
breadth
from
the
truth
in
the
telling
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
must
know
,
then
,
that
the
above-named
gentleman
whenever
he
was
at
*NL*
leisure
-LRB-
which
was
mostly
all
the
year
round
-RRB-
gave
himself
up
to
reading
*NL*
books
of
chivalry
with
such
ardour
and
avidity
that
he
almost
entirely
*NL*
neglected
the
pursuit
of
his
field-sports
,
and
even
the
management
of
his
*NL*
property
;
and
to
such
a
pitch
did
his
eagerness
and
infatuation
go
that
*NL*
he
sold
many
an
acre
of
tillageland
to
buy
books
of
chivalry
to
read
,
and
*NL*
brought
home
as
many
of
them
as
he
could
get
.
But
of
all
there
were
none
*NL*
he
liked
so
well
as
those
of
the
famous
Feliciano
de
Silva
's
composition
,
*NL*
for
their
lucidity
of
style
and
complicated
conceits
were
as
pearls
in
*NL*
his
sight
,
particularly
when
in
his
reading
he
came
upon
courtships
and
*NL*
cartels
,
where
he
often
found
passages
like
``
the
reason
of
the
unreason
*NL*
with
which
my
reason
is
afflicted
so
weakens
my
reason
that
with
reason
I
*NL*
murmur
at
your
beauty
;
''
or
again
,
``
the
high
heavens
,
that
of
your
*NL*
divinity
divinely
fortify
you
with
the
stars
,
render
you
deserving
of
the
*NL*
desert
your
greatness
deserves
.
''
Over
conceits
of
this
sort
the
poor
*NL*
gentleman
lost
his
wits
,
and
used
to
lie
awake
striving
to
understand
*NL*
them
and
worm
the
meaning
out
of
them
;
what
Aristotle
himself
could
not
*NL*
have
made
out
or
extracted
had
he
come
to
life
again
for
that
special
*NL*
purpose
.
He
was
not
at
all
easy
about
the
wounds
which
Don
Belianis
gave
*NL*
and
took
,
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
,
great
as
were
the
surgeons
who
*NL*
had
cured
him
,
he
must
have
had
his
face
and
body
covered
all
over
with
*NL*
seams
and
scars
.
He
commended
,
however
,
the
author
's
way
of
ending
his
*NL*
book
with
the
promise
of
that
interminable
adventure
,
and
many
a
time
was
*NL*
he
tempted
to
take
up
his
pen
and
finish
it
properly
as
is
there
*NL*
proposed
,
which
no
doubt
he
would
have
done
,
and
made
a
successful
piece
*NL*
of
work
of
it
too
,
had
not
greater
and
more
absorbing
thoughts
prevented
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
an
argument
did
he
have
with
the
curate
of
his
village
-LRB-
a
learned
*NL*
man
,
and
a
graduate
of
Siguenza
-RRB-
as
to
which
had
been
the
better
knight
,
*NL*
Palmerin
of
England
or
Amadis
of
Gaul
.
Master
Nicholas
,
the
village
*NL*
barber
,
however
,
used
to
say
that
neither
of
them
came
up
to
the
Knight
*NL*
of
Phoebus
,
and
that
if
there
was
any
that
could
compare
with
him
it
was
*NL*
Don
Galaor
,
the
brother
of
Amadis
of
Gaul
,
because
he
had
a
spirit
that
*NL*
was
equal
to
every
occasion
,
and
was
no
finikin
knight
,
nor
lachrymose
*NL*
like
his
brother
,
while
in
the
matter
of
valour
he
was
not
a
whit
behind
*NL*
him
.
In
short
,
he
became
so
absorbed
in
his
books
that
he
spent
his
*NL*
nights
from
sunset
to
sunrise
,
and
his
days
from
dawn
to
dark
,
poring
*NL*
over
them
;
and
what
with
little
sleep
and
much
reading
his
brains
got
so
*NL*
dry
that
he
lost
his
wits
.
His
fancy
grew
full
of
what
he
used
to
read
*NL*
about
in
his
books
,
enchantments
,
quarrels
,
battles
,
challenges
,
wounds
,
*NL*
wooings
,
loves
,
agonies
,
and
all
sorts
of
impossible
nonsense
;
and
it
so
*NL*
possessed
his
mind
that
the
whole
fabric
of
invention
and
fancy
he
read
*NL*
of
was
true
,
that
to
him
no
history
in
the
world
had
more
reality
in
it
.
*NL*
He
used
to
say
the
Cid
Ruy
Diaz
was
a
very
good
knight
,
but
that
he
was
*NL*
not
to
be
compared
with
the
Knight
of
the
Burning
Sword
who
with
one
*NL*
back-stroke
cut
in
half
two
fierce
and
monstrous
giants
.
He
thought
more
*NL*
of
Bernardo
del
Carpio
because
at
Roncesvalles
he
slew
Roland
in
spite
of
*NL*
enchantments
,
availing
himself
of
the
artifice
of
Hercules
when
he
*NL*
strangled
Antaeus
the
son
of
Terra
in
his
arms
.
He
approved
highly
of
the
*NL*
giant
Morgante
,
because
,
although
of
the
giant
breed
which
is
always
*NL*
arrogant
and
ill-conditioned
,
he
alone
was
affable
and
well-bred
.
But
*NL*
above
all
he
admired
Reinaldos
of
Montalban
,
especially
when
he
saw
him
*NL*
sallying
forth
from
his
castle
and
robbing
everyone
he
met
,
and
when
*NL*
beyond
the
seas
he
stole
that
image
of
Mahomet
which
,
as
his
history
*NL*
says
,
was
entirely
of
gold
.
To
have
a
bout
of
kicking
at
that
traitor
of
*NL*
a
Ganelon
he
would
have
given
his
housekeeper
,
and
his
niece
into
the
*NL*
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
his
wits
being
quite
gone
,
he
hit
upon
the
strangest
notion
*NL*
that
ever
madman
in
this
world
hit
upon
,
and
that
was
that
he
fancied
it
*NL*
was
right
and
requisite
,
as
well
for
the
support
of
his
own
honour
as
for
*NL*
the
service
of
his
country
,
that
he
should
make
a
knight-errant
of
*NL*
himself
,
roaming
the
world
over
in
full
armour
and
on
horseback
in
quest
*NL*
of
adventures
,
and
putting
in
practice
himself
all
that
he
had
read
of
as
*NL*
being
the
usual
practices
of
knights-errant
;
righting
every
kind
of
*NL*
wrong
,
and
exposing
himself
to
peril
and
danger
from
which
,
in
the
issue
,
*NL*
he
was
to
reap
eternal
renown
and
fame
.
Already
the
poor
man
saw
himself
*NL*
crowned
by
the
might
of
his
arm
Emperor
of
Trebizond
at
least
;
and
so
,
*NL*
led
away
by
the
intense
enjoyment
he
found
in
these
pleasant
fancies
,
he
*NL*
set
himself
forthwith
to
put
his
scheme
into
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
he
did
was
to
clean
up
some
armour
that
had
belonged
to
*NL*
his
great-grandfather
,
and
had
been
for
ages
lying
forgotten
in
a
corner
*NL*
eaten
with
rust
and
covered
with
mildew
.
He
scoured
and
polished
it
as
*NL*
best
he
could
,
but
he
perceived
one
great
defect
in
it
,
that
it
had
no
*NL*
closed
helmet
,
nothing
but
a
simple
morion
.
This
deficiency
,
however
,
his
*NL*
ingenuity
supplied
,
for
he
contrived
a
kind
of
half-helmet
of
pasteboard
*NL*
which
,
fitted
on
to
the
morion
,
looked
like
a
whole
one
.
It
is
true
that
,
*NL*
in
order
to
see
if
it
was
strong
and
fit
to
stand
a
cut
,
he
drew
his
*NL*
sword
and
gave
it
a
couple
of
slashes
,
the
first
of
which
undid
in
an
*NL*
instant
what
had
taken
him
a
week
to
do
.
The
ease
with
which
he
had
*NL*
knocked
it
to
pieces
disconcerted
him
somewhat
,
and
to
guard
against
that
*NL*
danger
he
set
to
work
again
,
fixing
bars
of
iron
on
the
inside
until
he
*NL*
was
satisfied
with
its
strength
;
and
then
,
not
caring
to
try
any
more
*NL*
experiments
with
it
,
he
passed
it
and
adopted
it
as
a
helmet
of
the
most
*NL*
perfect
construction
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
next
proceeded
to
inspect
his
hack
,
which
,
with
more
quartos
than
a
*NL*
real
and
more
blemishes
than
the
steed
of
Gonela
,
that
``
tantum
pellis
et
*NL*
ossa
fuit
,
''
surpassed
in
his
eyes
the
Bucephalus
of
Alexander
or
the
*NL*
Babieca
of
the
Cid
.
Four
days
were
spent
in
thinking
what
name
to
give
*NL*
him
,
because
-LRB-
as
he
said
to
himself
-RRB-
it
was
not
right
that
a
horse
*NL*
belonging
to
a
knight
so
famous
,
and
one
with
such
merits
of
his
own
,
*NL*
should
be
without
some
distinctive
name
,
and
he
strove
to
adapt
it
so
as
*NL*
to
indicate
what
he
had
been
before
belonging
to
a
knight-errant
,
and
*NL*
what
he
then
was
;
for
it
was
only
reasonable
that
,
his
master
taking
a
*NL*
new
character
,
he
should
take
a
new
name
,
and
that
it
should
be
a
*NL*
distinguished
and
full-sounding
one
,
befitting
the
new
order
and
calling
*NL*
he
was
about
to
follow
.
And
so
,
after
having
composed
,
struck
out
,
*NL*
rejected
,
added
to
,
unmade
,
and
remade
a
multitude
of
names
out
of
his
*NL*
memory
and
fancy
,
he
decided
upon
calling
him
Rocinante
,
a
name
,
to
his
*NL*
thinking
,
lofty
,
sonorous
,
and
significant
of
his
condition
as
a
hack
*NL*
before
he
became
what
he
now
was
,
the
first
and
foremost
of
all
the
hacks
*NL*
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
got
a
name
for
his
horse
so
much
to
his
taste
,
he
was
anxious
to
*NL*
get
one
for
himself
,
and
he
was
eight
days
more
pondering
over
this
*NL*
point
,
till
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
call
himself
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
*NL*
whence
,
as
has
been
already
said
,
the
authors
of
this
veracious
history
*NL*
have
inferred
that
his
name
must
have
been
beyond
a
doubt
Quixada
,
and
*NL*
not
Quesada
as
others
would
have
it
.
Recollecting
,
however
,
that
the
*NL*
valiant
Amadis
was
not
content
to
call
himself
curtly
Amadis
and
nothing
*NL*
more
,
but
added
the
name
of
his
kingdom
and
country
to
make
it
famous
,
*NL*
and
called
himself
Amadis
of
Gaul
,
he
,
like
a
good
knight
,
resolved
to
*NL*
add
on
the
name
of
his
,
and
to
style
himself
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
*NL*
whereby
,
he
considered
,
he
described
accurately
his
origin
and
country
,
*NL*
and
did
honour
to
it
in
taking
his
surname
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
then
,
his
armour
being
furbished
,
his
morion
turned
into
a
helmet
,
his
*NL*
hack
christened
,
and
he
himself
confirmed
,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
*NL*
nothing
more
was
needed
now
but
to
look
out
for
a
lady
to
be
in
love
*NL*
with
;
for
a
knight-errant
without
love
was
like
a
tree
without
leaves
or
*NL*
fruit
,
or
a
body
without
a
soul
.
As
he
said
to
himself
,
``
If
,
for
my
sins
,
*NL*
or
by
my
good
fortune
,
I
come
across
some
giant
hereabouts
,
a
common
*NL*
occurrence
with
knights-errant
,
and
overthrow
him
in
one
onslaught
,
or
*NL*
cleave
him
asunder
to
the
waist
,
or
,
in
short
,
vanquish
and
subdue
him
,
*NL*
will
it
not
be
well
to
have
some
one
I
may
send
him
to
as
a
present
,
that
*NL*
he
may
come
in
and
fall
on
his
knees
before
my
sweet
lady
,
and
in
a
*NL*
humble
,
submissive
voice
say
,
'
I
am
the
giant
Caraculiambro
,
lord
of
the
*NL*
island
of
Malindrania
,
vanquished
in
single
combat
by
the
never
*NL*
sufficiently
extolled
knight
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
who
has
commanded
*NL*
me
to
present
myself
before
your
Grace
,
that
your
Highness
dispose
of
me
*NL*
at
your
pleasure
'
?
''
Oh
,
how
our
good
gentleman
enjoyed
the
delivery
of
*NL*
this
speech
,
especially
when
he
had
thought
of
some
one
to
call
his
Lady
!
*NL*
There
was
,
so
the
story
goes
,
in
a
village
near
his
own
a
very
*NL*
good-looking
farm-girl
with
whom
he
had
been
at
one
time
in
love
,
though
,
*NL*
so
far
as
is
known
,
she
never
knew
it
nor
gave
a
thought
to
the
matter
.
*NL*
Her
name
was
Aldonza
Lorenzo
,
and
upon
her
he
thought
fit
to
confer
the
*NL*
title
of
Lady
of
his
Thoughts
;
and
after
some
search
for
a
name
which
*NL*
should
not
be
out
of
harmony
with
her
own
,
and
should
suggest
and
*NL*
indicate
that
of
a
princess
and
great
lady
,
he
decided
upon
calling
her
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
--
she
being
of
El
Toboso
--
a
name
,
to
his
mind
,
*NL*
musical
,
uncommon
,
and
significant
,
like
all
those
he
had
already
*NL*
bestowed
upon
himself
and
the
things
belonging
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
THE
FIRST
SALLY
THE
INGENIOUS
DON
QUIXOTE
MADE
FROM
HOME
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
These
preliminaries
settled
,
he
did
not
care
to
put
off
any
longer
the
*NL*
execution
of
his
design
,
urged
on
to
it
by
the
thought
of
all
the
world
*NL*
was
losing
by
his
delay
,
seeing
what
wrongs
he
intended
to
right
,
*NL*
grievances
to
redress
,
injustices
to
repair
,
abuses
to
remove
,
and
duties
*NL*
to
discharge
.
So
,
without
giving
notice
of
his
intention
to
anyone
,
and
*NL*
without
anybody
seeing
him
,
one
morning
before
the
dawning
of
the
day
*NL*
-LRB-
which
was
one
of
the
hottest
of
the
month
of
July
-RRB-
he
donned
his
suit
of
*NL*
armour
,
mounted
Rocinante
with
his
patched-up
helmet
on
,
braced
his
*NL*
buckler
,
took
his
lance
,
and
by
the
back
door
of
the
yard
sallied
forth
*NL*
upon
the
plain
in
the
highest
contentment
and
satisfaction
at
seeing
with
*NL*
what
ease
he
had
made
a
beginning
with
his
grand
purpose
.
But
scarcely
*NL*
did
he
find
himself
upon
the
open
plain
,
when
a
terrible
thought
struck
*NL*
him
,
one
all
but
enough
to
make
him
abandon
the
enterprise
at
the
very
*NL*
outset
.
It
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
not
been
dubbed
a
knight
,
and
that
*NL*
according
to
the
law
of
chivalry
he
neither
could
nor
ought
to
bear
arms
*NL*
against
any
knight
;
and
that
even
if
he
had
been
,
still
he
ought
,
as
a
*NL*
novice
knight
,
to
wear
white
armour
,
without
a
device
upon
the
shield
*NL*
until
by
his
prowess
he
had
earned
one
.
These
reflections
made
him
waver
*NL*
in
his
purpose
,
but
his
craze
being
stronger
than
any
reasoning
,
he
made
*NL*
up
his
mind
to
have
himself
dubbed
a
knight
by
the
first
one
he
came
*NL*
across
,
following
the
example
of
others
in
the
same
case
,
as
he
had
read
*NL*
in
the
books
that
brought
him
to
this
pass
.
As
for
white
armour
,
he
*NL*
resolved
,
on
the
first
opportunity
,
to
scour
his
until
it
was
whiter
than
*NL*
an
ermine
;
and
so
comforting
himself
he
pursued
his
way
,
taking
that
*NL*
which
his
horse
chose
,
for
in
this
he
believed
lay
the
essence
of
*NL*
adventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
setting
out
,
our
new-fledged
adventurer
paced
along
,
talking
to
*NL*
himself
and
saying
,
``
Who
knows
but
that
in
time
to
come
,
when
the
*NL*
veracious
history
of
my
famous
deeds
is
made
known
,
the
sage
who
writes
*NL*
it
,
when
he
has
to
set
forth
my
first
sally
in
the
early
morning
,
will
do
*NL*
it
after
this
fashion
?
`
Scarce
had
the
rubicund
Apollo
spread
o'er
the
*NL*
face
of
the
broad
spacious
earth
the
golden
threads
of
his
bright
hair
,
*NL*
scarce
had
the
little
birds
of
painted
plumage
attuned
their
notes
to
*NL*
hail
with
dulcet
and
mellifluous
harmony
the
coming
of
the
rosy
Dawn
,
*NL*
that
,
deserting
the
soft
couch
of
her
jealous
spouse
,
was
appearing
to
*NL*
mortals
at
the
gates
and
balconies
of
the
Manchegan
horizon
,
when
the
*NL*
renowned
knight
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
quitting
the
lazy
down
,
mounted
*NL*
his
celebrated
steed
Rocinante
and
began
to
traverse
the
ancient
and
*NL*
famous
Campo
de
Montiel
;
'
''
which
in
fact
he
was
actually
traversing
.
*NL*
``
Happy
the
age
,
happy
the
time
,
''
he
continued
,
``
in
which
shall
be
made
*NL*
known
my
deeds
of
fame
,
worthy
to
be
moulded
in
brass
,
carved
in
marble
,
*NL*
limned
in
pictures
,
for
a
memorial
for
ever
.
And
thou
,
O
sage
magician
,
*NL*
whoever
thou
art
,
to
whom
it
shall
fall
to
be
the
chronicler
of
this
*NL*
wondrous
history
,
forget
not
,
I
entreat
thee
,
my
good
Rocinante
,
the
*NL*
constant
companion
of
my
ways
and
wanderings
.
''
Presently
he
broke
out
*NL*
again
,
as
if
he
were
love-stricken
in
earnest
,
``
O
Princess
Dulcinea
,
lady
*NL*
of
this
captive
heart
,
a
grievous
wrong
hast
thou
done
me
to
drive
me
*NL*
forth
with
scorn
,
and
with
inexorable
obduracy
banish
me
from
the
*NL*
presence
of
thy
beauty
.
O
lady
,
deign
to
hold
in
remembrance
this
heart
,
*NL*
thy
vassal
,
that
thus
in
anguish
pines
for
love
of
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
went
on
stringing
together
these
and
other
absurdities
,
all
in
the
*NL*
style
of
those
his
books
had
taught
him
,
imitating
their
language
as
well
*NL*
as
he
could
;
and
all
the
while
he
rode
so
slowly
and
the
sun
mounted
so
*NL*
rapidly
and
with
such
fervour
that
it
was
enough
to
melt
his
brains
if
he
*NL*
had
any
.
Nearly
all
day
he
travelled
without
anything
remarkable
*NL*
happening
to
him
,
at
which
he
was
in
despair
,
for
he
was
anxious
to
*NL*
encounter
some
one
at
once
upon
whom
to
try
the
might
of
his
strong
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Writers
there
are
who
say
the
first
adventure
he
met
with
was
that
of
*NL*
Puerto
Lapice
;
others
say
it
was
that
of
the
windmills
;
but
what
I
have
*NL*
ascertained
on
this
point
,
and
what
I
have
found
written
in
the
annals
of
*NL*
La
Mancha
,
is
that
he
was
on
the
road
all
day
,
and
towards
nightfall
his
*NL*
hack
and
he
found
themselves
dead
tired
and
hungry
,
when
,
looking
all
*NL*
around
to
see
if
he
could
discover
any
castle
or
shepherd
's
shanty
where
*NL*
he
might
refresh
himself
and
relieve
his
sore
wants
,
he
perceived
not
far
*NL*
out
of
his
road
an
inn
,
which
was
as
welcome
as
a
star
guiding
him
to
the
*NL*
portals
,
if
not
the
palaces
,
of
his
redemption
;
and
quickening
his
pace
*NL*
he
reached
it
just
as
night
was
setting
in
.
At
the
door
were
standing
two
*NL*
young
women
,
girls
of
the
district
as
they
call
them
,
on
their
way
to
*NL*
Seville
with
some
carriers
who
had
chanced
to
halt
that
night
at
the
inn
;
*NL*
and
as
,
happen
what
might
to
our
adventurer
,
everything
he
saw
or
imaged
*NL*
seemed
to
him
to
be
and
to
happen
after
the
fashion
of
what
he
read
of
,
*NL*
the
moment
he
saw
the
inn
he
pictured
it
to
himself
as
a
castle
with
its
*NL*
four
turrets
and
pinnacles
of
shining
silver
,
not
forgetting
the
*NL*
drawbridge
and
moat
and
all
the
belongings
usually
ascribed
to
castles
of
*NL*
the
sort
.
To
this
inn
,
which
to
him
seemed
a
castle
,
he
advanced
,
and
at
*NL*
a
short
distance
from
it
he
checked
Rocinante
,
hoping
that
some
dwarf
*NL*
would
show
himself
upon
the
battlements
,
and
by
sound
of
trumpet
give
*NL*
notice
that
a
knight
was
approaching
the
castle
.
But
seeing
that
they
*NL*
were
slow
about
it
,
and
that
Rocinante
was
in
a
hurry
to
reach
the
*NL*
stable
,
he
made
for
the
inn
door
,
and
perceived
the
two
gay
damsels
who
*NL*
were
standing
there
,
and
who
seemed
to
him
to
be
two
fair
maidens
or
*NL*
lovely
ladies
taking
their
ease
at
the
castle
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
it
so
happened
that
a
swineherd
who
was
going
through
the
*NL*
stubbles
collecting
a
drove
of
pigs
-LRB-
for
,
without
any
apology
,
that
is
*NL*
what
they
are
called
-RRB-
gave
a
blast
of
his
horn
to
bring
them
together
,
*NL*
and
forthwith
it
seemed
to
Don
Quixote
to
be
what
he
was
expecting
,
the
*NL*
signal
of
some
dwarf
announcing
his
arrival
;
and
so
with
prodigious
*NL*
satisfaction
he
rode
up
to
the
inn
and
to
the
ladies
,
who
,
seeing
a
man
*NL*
of
this
sort
approaching
in
full
armour
and
with
lance
and
buckler
,
were
*NL*
turning
in
dismay
into
the
inn
,
when
Don
Quixote
,
guessing
their
fear
by
*NL*
their
flight
,
raising
his
pasteboard
visor
,
disclosed
his
dry
dusty
*NL*
visage
,
and
with
courteous
bearing
and
gentle
voice
addressed
them
,
``
Your
*NL*
ladyships
need
not
fly
or
fear
any
rudeness
,
for
that
it
belongs
not
to
*NL*
the
order
of
knighthood
which
I
profess
to
offer
to
anyone
,
much
less
to
*NL*
highborn
maidens
as
your
appearance
proclaims
you
to
be
.
''
The
girls
were
*NL*
looking
at
him
and
straining
their
eyes
to
make
out
the
features
which
*NL*
the
clumsy
visor
obscured
,
but
when
they
heard
themselves
called
maidens
,
*NL*
a
thing
so
much
out
of
their
line
,
they
could
not
restrain
their
*NL*
laughter
,
which
made
Don
Quixote
wax
indignant
,
and
say
,
``
Modesty
becomes
*NL*
the
fair
,
and
moreover
laughter
that
has
little
cause
is
great
silliness
;
*NL*
this
,
however
,
I
say
not
to
pain
or
anger
you
,
for
my
desire
is
none
*NL*
other
than
to
serve
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
incomprehensible
language
and
the
unpromising
looks
of
our
cavalier
*NL*
only
increased
the
ladies
'
laughter
,
and
that
increased
his
irritation
,
*NL*
and
matters
might
have
gone
farther
if
at
that
moment
the
landlord
had
*NL*
not
come
out
,
who
,
being
a
very
fat
man
,
was
a
very
peaceful
one
.
He
,
*NL*
seeing
this
grotesque
figure
clad
in
armour
that
did
not
match
any
more
*NL*
than
his
saddle
,
bridle
,
lance
,
buckler
,
or
corselet
,
was
not
at
all
*NL*
indisposed
to
join
the
damsels
in
their
manifestations
of
amusement
;
but
,
*NL*
in
truth
,
standing
in
awe
of
such
a
complicated
armament
,
he
thought
it
*NL*
best
to
speak
him
fairly
,
so
he
said
,
``
Senor
Caballero
,
if
your
worship
*NL*
wants
lodging
,
bating
the
bed
-LRB-
for
there
is
not
one
in
the
inn
-RRB-
there
is
*NL*
plenty
of
everything
else
here
.
''
Don
Quixote
,
observing
the
respectful
*NL*
bearing
of
the
Alcaide
of
the
fortress
-LRB-
for
so
innkeeper
and
inn
seemed
*NL*
in
his
eyes
-RRB-
,
made
answer
,
``
Sir
Castellan
,
for
me
anything
will
suffice
,
*NL*
for
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
armour
is
my
only
wear
,
*NL*
My
only
rest
the
fray
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
fancied
he
called
him
Castellan
because
he
took
him
for
a
*NL*
``
worthy
of
Castile
,
''
though
he
was
in
fact
an
Andalusian
,
and
one
from
*NL*
the
strand
of
San
Lucar
,
as
crafty
a
thief
as
Cacus
and
as
full
of
tricks
*NL*
as
a
student
or
a
page
.
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Your
bed
is
on
the
flinty
rock
,
*NL*
Your
sleep
to
watch
alway
;
'
*NL*
*NL*
and
if
so
,
you
may
dismount
and
safely
reckon
upon
any
quantity
of
*NL*
sleeplessness
under
this
roof
for
a
twelvemonth
,
not
to
say
for
a
single
*NL*
night
.
''
So
saying
,
he
advanced
to
hold
the
stirrup
for
Don
Quixote
,
who
*NL*
got
down
with
great
difficulty
and
exertion
-LRB-
for
he
had
not
broken
his
*NL*
fast
all
day
-RRB-
,
and
then
charged
the
host
to
take
great
care
of
his
horse
,
*NL*
as
he
was
the
best
bit
of
flesh
that
ever
ate
bread
in
this
world
.
The
*NL*
landlord
eyed
him
over
but
did
not
find
him
as
good
as
Don
Quixote
said
,
*NL*
nor
even
half
as
good
;
and
putting
him
up
in
the
stable
,
he
returned
to
*NL*
see
what
might
be
wanted
by
his
guest
,
whom
the
damsels
,
who
had
by
this
*NL*
time
made
their
peace
with
him
,
were
now
relieving
of
his
armour
.
They
*NL*
had
taken
off
his
breastplate
and
backpiece
,
but
they
neither
knew
nor
*NL*
saw
how
to
open
his
gorget
or
remove
his
make-shift
helmet
,
for
he
had
*NL*
fastened
it
with
green
ribbons
,
which
,
as
there
was
no
untying
the
knots
,
*NL*
required
to
be
cut
.
This
,
however
,
he
would
not
by
any
means
consent
to
,
*NL*
so
he
remained
all
the
evening
with
his
helmet
on
,
the
drollest
and
*NL*
oddest
figure
that
can
be
imagined
;
and
while
they
were
removing
his
*NL*
armour
,
taking
the
baggages
who
were
about
it
for
ladies
of
high
degree
*NL*
belonging
to
the
castle
,
he
said
to
them
with
great
sprightliness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
never
,
surely
,
was
there
knight
*NL*
So
served
by
hand
of
dame
,
*NL*
As
served
was
he
,
Don
Quixote
hight
,
*NL*
When
from
his
town
he
came
;
*NL*
With
maidens
waiting
on
himself
,
*NL*
Princesses
on
his
hack
--
*NL*
*NL*
or
Rocinante
,
for
that
,
ladies
mine
,
is
my
horse
's
name
,
and
Don
Quixote
*NL*
of
La
Mancha
is
my
own
;
for
though
I
had
no
intention
of
declaring
myself
*NL*
until
my
achievements
in
your
service
and
honour
had
made
me
known
,
the
*NL*
necessity
of
adapting
that
old
ballad
of
Lancelot
to
the
present
occasion
*NL*
has
given
you
the
knowledge
of
my
name
altogether
prematurely
.
A
time
,
*NL*
however
,
will
come
for
your
ladyships
to
command
and
me
to
obey
,
and
then
*NL*
the
might
of
my
arm
will
show
my
desire
to
serve
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
,
who
were
not
used
to
hearing
rhetoric
of
this
sort
,
had
*NL*
nothing
to
say
in
reply
;
they
only
asked
him
if
he
wanted
anything
to
*NL*
eat
.
``
I
would
gladly
eat
a
bit
of
something
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
I
*NL*
feel
it
would
come
very
seasonably
.
''
The
day
happened
to
be
a
Friday
,
and
*NL*
in
the
whole
inn
there
was
nothing
but
some
pieces
of
the
fish
they
call
*NL*
in
Castile
``
abadejo
,
''
in
Andalusia
``
bacallao
,
''
and
in
some
places
*NL*
``
curadillo
,
''
and
in
others
``
troutlet
;
''
so
they
asked
him
if
he
thought
he
*NL*
could
eat
troutlet
,
for
there
was
no
other
fish
to
give
him
.
``
If
there
be
*NL*
troutlets
enough
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
they
will
be
the
same
thing
as
a
*NL*
trout
;
for
it
is
all
one
to
me
whether
I
am
given
eight
reals
in
small
*NL*
change
or
a
piece
of
eight
;
moreover
,
it
may
be
that
these
troutlets
are
*NL*
like
veal
,
which
is
better
than
beef
,
or
kid
,
which
is
better
than
goat
.
*NL*
But
whatever
it
be
let
it
come
quickly
,
for
the
burden
and
pressure
of
*NL*
arms
can
not
be
borne
without
support
to
the
inside
.
''
They
laid
a
table
*NL*
for
him
at
the
door
of
the
inn
for
the
sake
of
the
air
,
and
the
host
*NL*
brought
him
a
portion
of
ill-soaked
and
worse
cooked
stockfish
,
and
a
*NL*
piece
of
bread
as
black
and
mouldy
as
his
own
armour
;
but
a
laughable
*NL*
sight
it
was
to
see
him
eating
,
for
having
his
helmet
on
and
the
beaver
*NL*
up
,
he
could
not
with
his
own
hands
put
anything
into
his
mouth
unless
*NL*
some
one
else
placed
it
there
,
and
this
service
one
of
the
ladies
*NL*
rendered
him
.
But
to
give
him
anything
to
drink
was
impossible
,
or
would
*NL*
have
been
so
had
not
the
landlord
bored
a
reed
,
and
putting
one
end
in
*NL*
his
mouth
poured
the
wine
into
him
through
the
other
;
all
which
he
bore
*NL*
with
patience
rather
than
sever
the
ribbons
of
his
helmet
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
going
on
there
came
up
to
the
inn
a
sowgelder
,
who
,
as
he
*NL*
approached
,
sounded
his
reed
pipe
four
or
five
times
,
and
thereby
*NL*
completely
convinced
Don
Quixote
that
he
was
in
some
famous
castle
,
and
*NL*
that
they
were
regaling
him
with
music
,
and
that
the
stockfish
was
trout
,
*NL*
the
bread
the
whitest
,
the
wenches
ladies
,
and
the
landlord
the
castellan
*NL*
of
the
castle
;
and
consequently
he
held
that
his
enterprise
and
sally
had
*NL*
been
to
some
purpose
.
But
still
it
distressed
him
to
think
he
had
not
*NL*
been
dubbed
a
knight
,
for
it
was
plain
to
him
he
could
not
lawfully
*NL*
engage
in
any
adventure
without
receiving
the
order
of
knighthood
.

CHAPTER
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
RELATED
THE
DROLL
WAY
IN
WHICH
DON
QUIXOTE
HAD
HIMSELF
DUBBED
*NL*
A
KNIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Harassed
by
this
reflection
,
he
made
haste
with
his
scanty
pothouse
*NL*
supper
,
and
having
finished
it
called
the
landlord
,
and
shutting
himself
*NL*
into
the
stable
with
him
,
fell
on
his
knees
before
him
,
saying
,
``
From
*NL*
this
spot
I
rise
not
,
valiant
knight
,
until
your
courtesy
grants
me
the
*NL*
boon
I
seek
,
one
that
will
redound
to
your
praise
and
the
benefit
of
the
*NL*
human
race
.
''
The
landlord
,
seeing
his
guest
at
his
feet
and
hearing
a
*NL*
speech
of
this
kind
,
stood
staring
at
him
in
bewilderment
,
not
knowing
*NL*
what
to
do
or
say
,
and
entreating
him
to
rise
,
but
all
to
no
purpose
*NL*
until
he
had
agreed
to
grant
the
boon
demanded
of
him
.
``
I
looked
for
no
*NL*
less
,
my
lord
,
from
your
High
Magnificence
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
I
*NL*
have
to
tell
you
that
the
boon
I
have
asked
and
your
liberality
has
*NL*
granted
is
that
you
shall
dub
me
knight
to-morrow
morning
,
and
that
*NL*
to-night
I
shall
watch
my
arms
in
the
chapel
of
this
your
castle
;
thus
*NL*
tomorrow
,
as
I
have
said
,
will
be
accomplished
what
I
so
much
desire
,
*NL*
enabling
me
lawfully
to
roam
through
all
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
*NL*
seeking
adventures
on
behalf
of
those
in
distress
,
as
is
the
duty
of
*NL*
chivalry
and
of
knights-errant
like
myself
,
whose
ambition
is
directed
to
*NL*
such
deeds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
,
who
,
as
has
been
mentioned
,
was
something
of
a
wag
,
and
had
*NL*
already
some
suspicion
of
his
guest
's
want
of
wits
,
was
quite
convinced
*NL*
of
it
on
hearing
talk
of
this
kind
from
him
,
and
to
make
sport
for
the
*NL*
night
he
determined
to
fall
in
with
his
humour
.
So
he
told
him
he
was
*NL*
quite
right
in
pursuing
the
object
he
had
in
view
,
and
that
such
a
motive
*NL*
was
natural
and
becoming
in
cavaliers
as
distinguished
as
he
seemed
and
*NL*
his
gallant
bearing
showed
him
to
be
;
and
that
he
himself
in
his
younger
*NL*
days
had
followed
the
same
honourable
calling
,
roaming
in
quest
of
*NL*
adventures
in
various
parts
of
the
world
,
among
others
the
Curing-grounds
*NL*
of
Malaga
,
the
Isles
of
Riaran
,
the
Precinct
of
Seville
,
the
Little
*NL*
Market
of
Segovia
,
the
Olivera
of
Valencia
,
the
Rondilla
of
Granada
,
the
*NL*
Strand
of
San
Lucar
,
the
Colt
of
Cordova
,
the
Taverns
of
Toledo
,
and
*NL*
divers
other
quarters
,
where
he
had
proved
the
nimbleness
of
his
feet
and
*NL*
the
lightness
of
his
fingers
,
doing
many
wrongs
,
cheating
many
widows
,
*NL*
ruining
maids
and
swindling
minors
,
and
,
in
short
,
bringing
himself
under
*NL*
the
notice
of
almost
every
tribunal
and
court
of
justice
in
Spain
;
until
*NL*
at
last
he
had
retired
to
this
castle
of
his
,
where
he
was
living
upon
*NL*
his
property
and
upon
that
of
others
;
and
where
he
received
all
*NL*
knights-errant
of
whatever
rank
or
condition
they
might
be
,
all
for
the
*NL*
great
love
he
bore
them
and
that
they
might
share
their
substance
with
*NL*
him
in
return
for
his
benevolence
.
He
told
him
,
moreover
,
that
in
this
*NL*
castle
of
his
there
was
no
chapel
in
which
he
could
watch
his
armour
,
as
*NL*
it
had
been
pulled
down
in
order
to
be
rebuilt
,
but
that
in
a
case
of
*NL*
necessity
it
might
,
he
knew
,
be
watched
anywhere
,
and
he
might
watch
it
*NL*
that
night
in
a
courtyard
of
the
castle
,
and
in
the
morning
,
God
willing
,
*NL*
the
requisite
ceremonies
might
be
performed
so
as
to
have
him
dubbed
a
*NL*
knight
,
and
so
thoroughly
dubbed
that
nobody
could
be
more
so
.
He
asked
*NL*
if
he
had
any
money
with
him
,
to
which
Don
Quixote
replied
that
he
had
*NL*
not
a
farthing
,
as
in
the
histories
of
knights-errant
he
had
never
read
*NL*
of
any
of
them
carrying
any
.
On
this
point
the
landlord
told
him
he
was
*NL*
mistaken
;
for
,
though
not
recorded
in
the
histories
,
because
in
the
*NL*
author
's
opinion
there
was
no
need
to
mention
anything
so
obvious
and
*NL*
necessary
as
money
and
clean
shirts
,
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
therefore
*NL*
that
they
did
not
carry
them
,
and
he
might
regard
it
as
certain
and
*NL*
established
that
all
knights-errant
-LRB-
about
whom
there
were
so
many
full
*NL*
and
unimpeachable
books
-RRB-
carried
well-furnished
purses
in
case
of
*NL*
emergency
,
and
likewise
carried
shirts
and
a
little
box
of
ointment
to
*NL*
cure
the
wounds
they
received
.
For
in
those
plains
and
deserts
where
they
*NL*
engaged
in
combat
and
came
out
wounded
,
it
was
not
always
that
there
was
*NL*
some
one
to
cure
them
,
unless
indeed
they
had
for
a
friend
some
sage
*NL*
magician
to
succour
them
at
once
by
fetching
through
the
air
upon
a
cloud
*NL*
some
damsel
or
dwarf
with
a
vial
of
water
of
such
virtue
that
by
tasting
*NL*
one
drop
of
it
they
were
cured
of
their
hurts
and
wounds
in
an
instant
*NL*
and
left
as
sound
as
if
they
had
not
received
any
damage
whatever
.
But
in
*NL*
case
this
should
not
occur
,
the
knights
of
old
took
care
to
see
that
*NL*
their
squires
were
provided
with
money
and
other
requisites
,
such
as
lint
*NL*
and
ointments
for
healing
purposes
;
and
when
it
happened
that
knights
had
*NL*
no
squires
-LRB-
which
was
rarely
and
seldom
the
case
-RRB-
they
themselves
carried
*NL*
everything
in
cunning
saddle-bags
that
were
hardly
seen
on
the
horse
's
*NL*
croup
,
as
if
it
were
something
else
of
more
importance
,
because
,
unless
*NL*
for
some
such
reason
,
carrying
saddle-bags
was
not
very
favourably
*NL*
regarded
among
knights-errant
.
He
therefore
advised
him
-LRB-
and
,
as
his
*NL*
godson
so
soon
to
be
,
he
might
even
command
him
-RRB-
never
from
that
time
*NL*
forth
to
travel
without
money
and
the
usual
requirements
,
and
he
would
*NL*
find
the
advantage
of
them
when
he
least
expected
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
promised
to
follow
his
advice
scrupulously
,
and
it
was
*NL*
arranged
forthwith
that
he
should
watch
his
armour
in
a
large
yard
at
one
*NL*
side
of
the
inn
;
so
,
collecting
it
all
together
,
Don
Quixote
placed
it
on
*NL*
a
trough
that
stood
by
the
side
of
a
well
,
and
bracing
his
buckler
on
his
*NL*
arm
he
grasped
his
lance
and
began
with
a
stately
air
to
march
up
and
*NL*
down
in
front
of
the
trough
,
and
as
he
began
his
march
night
began
to
*NL*
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
told
all
the
people
who
were
in
the
inn
about
the
craze
of
*NL*
his
guest
,
the
watching
of
the
armour
,
and
the
dubbing
ceremony
he
*NL*
contemplated
.
Full
of
wonder
at
so
strange
a
form
of
madness
,
they
*NL*
flocked
to
see
it
from
a
distance
,
and
observed
with
what
composure
he
*NL*
sometimes
paced
up
and
down
,
or
sometimes
,
leaning
on
his
lance
,
gazed
on
*NL*
his
armour
without
taking
his
eyes
off
it
for
ever
so
long
;
and
as
the
*NL*
night
closed
in
with
a
light
from
the
moon
so
brilliant
that
it
might
vie
*NL*
with
his
that
lent
it
,
everything
the
novice
knight
did
was
plainly
seen
*NL*
by
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
one
of
the
carriers
who
were
in
the
inn
thought
fit
to
water
*NL*
his
team
,
and
it
was
necessary
to
remove
Don
Quixote
's
armour
as
it
lay
*NL*
on
the
trough
;
but
he
seeing
the
other
approach
hailed
him
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
,
``
O
thou
,
whoever
thou
art
,
rash
knight
that
comest
to
lay
hands
on
*NL*
the
armour
of
the
most
valorous
errant
that
ever
girt
on
sword
,
have
a
*NL*
care
what
thou
dost
;
touch
it
not
unless
thou
wouldst
lay
down
thy
life
*NL*
as
the
penalty
of
thy
rashness
.
''
The
carrier
gave
no
heed
to
these
words
*NL*
-LRB-
and
he
would
have
done
better
to
heed
them
if
he
had
been
heedful
of
his
*NL*
health
-RRB-
,
but
seizing
it
by
the
straps
flung
the
armour
some
distance
from
*NL*
him
.
Seeing
this
,
Don
Quixote
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
,
and
fixing
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
apparently
,
upon
his
lady
Dulcinea
,
exclaimed
,
``
Aid
me
,
lady
*NL*
mine
,
in
this
the
first
encounter
that
presents
itself
to
this
breast
*NL*
which
thou
holdest
in
subjection
;
let
not
thy
favour
and
protection
fail
*NL*
me
in
this
first
jeopardy
;
''
and
,
with
these
words
and
others
to
the
same
*NL*
purpose
,
dropping
his
buckler
he
lifted
his
lance
with
both
hands
and
*NL*
with
it
smote
such
a
blow
on
the
carrier
's
head
that
he
stretched
him
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
so
stunned
that
had
he
followed
it
up
with
a
second
there
*NL*
would
have
been
no
need
of
a
surgeon
to
cure
him
.
This
done
,
he
picked
up
*NL*
his
armour
and
returned
to
his
beat
with
the
same
serenity
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
after
this
,
another
,
not
knowing
what
had
happened
-LRB-
for
the
*NL*
carrier
still
lay
senseless
-RRB-
,
came
with
the
same
object
of
giving
water
*NL*
to
his
mules
,
and
was
proceeding
to
remove
the
armour
in
order
to
clear
*NL*
the
trough
,
when
Don
Quixote
,
without
uttering
a
word
or
imploring
aid
*NL*
from
anyone
,
once
more
dropped
his
buckler
and
once
more
lifted
his
*NL*
lance
,
and
without
actually
breaking
the
second
carrier
's
head
into
*NL*
pieces
,
made
more
than
three
of
it
,
for
he
laid
it
open
in
four
.
At
the
*NL*
noise
all
the
people
of
the
inn
ran
to
the
spot
,
and
among
them
the
*NL*
landlord
.
Seeing
this
,
Don
Quixote
braced
his
buckler
on
his
arm
,
and
*NL*
with
his
hand
on
his
sword
exclaimed
,
``
O
Lady
of
Beauty
,
strength
and
*NL*
support
of
my
faint
heart
,
it
is
time
for
thee
to
turn
the
eyes
of
thy
*NL*
greatness
on
this
thy
captive
knight
on
the
brink
of
so
mighty
an
*NL*
adventure
.
''
By
this
he
felt
himself
so
inspired
that
he
would
not
have
*NL*
flinched
if
all
the
carriers
in
the
world
had
assailed
him
.
The
comrades
*NL*
of
the
wounded
perceiving
the
plight
they
were
in
began
from
a
distance
*NL*
to
shower
stones
on
Don
Quixote
,
who
screened
himself
as
best
he
could
*NL*
with
his
buckler
,
not
daring
to
quit
the
trough
and
leave
his
armour
*NL*
unprotected
.
The
landlord
shouted
to
them
to
leave
him
alone
,
for
he
had
*NL*
already
told
them
that
he
was
mad
,
and
as
a
madman
he
would
not
be
*NL*
accountable
even
if
he
killed
them
all
.
Still
louder
shouted
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
calling
them
knaves
and
traitors
,
and
the
lord
of
the
castle
,
who
allowed
*NL*
knights-errant
to
be
treated
in
this
fashion
,
a
villain
and
a
low-born
*NL*
knight
whom
,
had
he
received
the
order
of
knighthood
,
he
would
call
to
*NL*
account
for
his
treachery
.
``
But
of
you
,
''
he
cried
,
``
base
and
vile
rabble
,
*NL*
I
make
no
account
;
fling
,
strike
,
come
on
,
do
all
ye
can
against
me
,
ye
*NL*
shall
see
what
the
reward
of
your
folly
and
insolence
will
be
.
''
This
he
*NL*
uttered
with
so
much
spirit
and
boldness
that
he
filled
his
assailants
*NL*
with
a
terrible
fear
,
and
as
much
for
this
reason
as
at
the
persuasion
of
*NL*
the
landlord
they
left
off
stoning
him
,
and
he
allowed
them
to
carry
off
*NL*
the
wounded
,
and
with
the
same
calmness
and
composure
as
before
resumed
*NL*
the
watch
over
his
armour
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
freaks
of
his
guest
were
not
much
to
the
liking
of
the
*NL*
landlord
,
so
he
determined
to
cut
matters
short
and
confer
upon
him
at
*NL*
once
the
unlucky
order
of
knighthood
before
any
further
misadventure
*NL*
could
occur
;
so
,
going
up
to
him
,
he
apologised
for
the
rudeness
which
,
*NL*
without
his
knowledge
,
had
been
offered
to
him
by
these
low
people
,
who
,
*NL*
however
,
had
been
well
punished
for
their
audacity
.
As
he
had
already
*NL*
told
him
,
he
said
,
there
was
no
chapel
in
the
castle
,
nor
was
it
needed
*NL*
for
what
remained
to
be
done
,
for
,
as
he
understood
the
ceremonial
of
the
*NL*
order
,
the
whole
point
of
being
dubbed
a
knight
lay
in
the
accolade
and
*NL*
in
the
slap
on
the
shoulder
,
and
that
could
be
administered
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
a
field
;
and
that
he
had
now
done
all
that
was
needful
as
to
watching
*NL*
the
armour
,
for
all
requirements
were
satisfied
by
a
watch
of
two
hours
*NL*
only
,
while
he
had
been
more
than
four
about
it
.
Don
Quixote
believed
it
*NL*
all
,
and
told
him
he
stood
there
ready
to
obey
him
,
and
to
make
an
end
of
*NL*
it
with
as
much
despatch
as
possible
;
for
,
if
he
were
again
attacked
,
and
*NL*
felt
himself
to
be
dubbed
knight
,
he
would
not
,
he
thought
,
leave
a
soul
*NL*
alive
in
the
castle
,
except
such
as
out
of
respect
he
might
spare
at
his
*NL*
bidding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
warned
and
menaced
,
the
castellan
forthwith
brought
out
a
book
in
*NL*
which
he
used
to
enter
the
straw
and
barley
he
served
out
to
the
*NL*
carriers
,
and
,
with
a
lad
carrying
a
candle-end
,
and
the
two
damsels
*NL*
already
mentioned
,
he
returned
to
where
Don
Quixote
stood
,
and
bade
him
*NL*
kneel
down
.
Then
,
reading
from
his
account-book
as
if
he
were
repeating
*NL*
some
devout
prayer
,
in
the
middle
of
his
delivery
he
raised
his
hand
and
*NL*
gave
him
a
sturdy
blow
on
the
neck
,
and
then
,
with
his
own
sword
,
a
smart
*NL*
slap
on
the
shoulder
,
all
the
while
muttering
between
his
teeth
as
if
he
*NL*
was
saying
his
prayers
.
Having
done
this
,
he
directed
one
of
the
ladies
*NL*
to
gird
on
his
sword
,
which
she
did
with
great
self-possession
and
*NL*
gravity
,
and
not
a
little
was
required
to
prevent
a
burst
of
laughter
at
*NL*
each
stage
of
the
ceremony
;
but
what
they
had
already
seen
of
the
novice
*NL*
knight
's
prowess
kept
their
laughter
within
bounds
.
On
girding
him
with
*NL*
the
sword
the
worthy
lady
said
to
him
,
``
May
God
make
your
worship
a
very
*NL*
fortunate
knight
,
and
grant
you
success
in
battle
.
''
Don
Quixote
asked
her
*NL*
name
in
order
that
he
might
from
that
time
forward
know
to
whom
he
was
*NL*
beholden
for
the
favour
he
had
received
,
as
he
meant
to
confer
upon
her
*NL*
some
portion
of
the
honour
he
acquired
by
the
might
of
his
arm
.
She
*NL*
answered
with
great
humility
that
she
was
called
La
Tolosa
,
and
that
she
*NL*
was
the
daughter
of
a
cobbler
of
Toledo
who
lived
in
the
stalls
of
*NL*
Sanchobienaya
,
and
that
wherever
she
might
be
she
would
serve
and
esteem
*NL*
him
as
her
lord
.
Don
Quixote
said
in
reply
that
she
would
do
him
a
favour
*NL*
if
thenceforward
she
assumed
the
``
Don
''
and
called
herself
Dona
Tolosa
.
*NL*
She
promised
she
would
,
and
then
the
other
buckled
on
his
spur
,
and
with
*NL*
her
followed
almost
the
same
conversation
as
with
the
lady
of
the
sword
.
*NL*
He
asked
her
name
,
and
she
said
it
was
La
Molinera
,
and
that
she
was
the
*NL*
daughter
of
a
respectable
miller
of
Antequera
;
and
of
her
likewise
Don
*NL*
Quixote
requested
that
she
would
adopt
the
``
Don
''
and
call
herself
Dona
*NL*
Molinera
,
making
offers
to
her
further
services
and
favours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
,
with
hot
haste
and
speed
,
brought
to
a
conclusion
these
*NL*
never-till-now-seen
ceremonies
,
Don
Quixote
was
on
thorns
until
he
saw
*NL*
himself
on
horseback
sallying
forth
in
quest
of
adventures
;
and
saddling
*NL*
Rocinante
at
once
he
mounted
,
and
embracing
his
host
,
as
he
returned
*NL*
thanks
for
his
kindness
in
knighting
him
,
he
addressed
him
in
language
so
*NL*
extraordinary
that
it
is
impossible
to
convey
an
idea
of
it
or
report
it
.
*NL*
The
landlord
,
to
get
him
out
of
the
inn
,
replied
with
no
less
rhetoric
*NL*
though
with
shorter
words
,
and
without
calling
upon
him
to
pay
the
*NL*
reckoning
let
him
go
with
a
Godspeed
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
OUR
KNIGHT
WHEN
HE
LEFT
THE
INN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Day
was
dawning
when
Don
Quixote
quitted
the
inn
,
so
happy
,
so
gay
,
so
*NL*
exhilarated
at
finding
himself
now
dubbed
a
knight
,
that
his
joy
was
like
*NL*
to
burst
his
horse-girths
.
However
,
recalling
the
advice
of
his
host
as
*NL*
to
the
requisites
he
ought
to
carry
with
him
,
especially
that
referring
*NL*
to
money
and
shirts
,
he
determined
to
go
home
and
provide
himself
with
*NL*
all
,
and
also
with
a
squire
,
for
he
reckoned
upon
securing
a
*NL*
farm-labourer
,
a
neighbour
of
his
,
a
poor
man
with
a
family
,
but
very
*NL*
well
qualified
for
the
office
of
squire
to
a
knight
.
With
this
object
he
*NL*
turned
his
horse
's
head
towards
his
village
,
and
Rocinante
,
thus
reminded
*NL*
of
his
old
quarters
,
stepped
out
so
briskly
that
he
hardly
seemed
to
*NL*
tread
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
gone
far
,
when
out
of
a
thicket
on
his
right
there
seemed
to
*NL*
come
feeble
cries
as
of
some
one
in
distress
,
and
the
instant
he
heard
*NL*
them
he
exclaimed
,
``
Thanks
be
to
heaven
for
the
favour
it
accords
me
,
*NL*
that
it
so
soon
offers
me
an
opportunity
of
fulfilling
the
obligation
I
*NL*
have
undertaken
,
and
gathering
the
fruit
of
my
ambition
.
These
cries
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
come
from
some
man
or
woman
in
want
of
help
,
and
needing
my
aid
*NL*
and
protection
;
''
and
wheeling
,
he
turned
Rocinante
in
the
direction
*NL*
whence
the
cries
seemed
to
proceed
.
He
had
gone
but
a
few
paces
into
the
*NL*
wood
,
when
he
saw
a
mare
tied
to
an
oak
,
and
tied
to
another
,
and
*NL*
stripped
from
the
waist
upwards
,
a
youth
of
about
fifteen
years
of
age
,
*NL*
from
whom
the
cries
came
.
Nor
were
they
without
cause
,
for
a
lusty
farmer
*NL*
was
flogging
him
with
a
belt
and
following
up
every
blow
with
scoldings
*NL*
and
commands
,
repeating
,
``
Your
mouth
shut
and
your
eyes
open
!
''
while
the
*NL*
youth
made
answer
,
``
I
wo
n't
do
it
again
,
master
mine
;
by
God
's
passion
I
*NL*
wo
n't
do
it
again
,
and
I
'll
take
more
care
of
the
flock
another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
what
was
going
on
,
Don
Quixote
said
in
an
angry
voice
,
*NL*
``
Discourteous
knight
,
it
ill
becomes
you
to
assail
one
who
can
not
defend
*NL*
himself
;
mount
your
steed
and
take
your
lance
''
-LRB-
for
there
was
a
lance
*NL*
leaning
against
the
oak
to
which
the
mare
was
tied
-RRB-
,
``
and
I
will
make
you
*NL*
know
that
you
are
behaving
as
a
coward
.
''
The
farmer
,
seeing
before
him
*NL*
this
figure
in
full
armour
brandishing
a
lance
over
his
head
,
gave
*NL*
himself
up
for
dead
,
and
made
answer
meekly
,
``
Sir
Knight
,
this
youth
that
*NL*
I
am
chastising
is
my
servant
,
employed
by
me
to
watch
a
flock
of
sheep
*NL*
that
I
have
hard
by
,
and
he
is
so
careless
that
I
lose
one
every
day
,
and
*NL*
when
I
punish
him
for
his
carelessness
and
knavery
he
says
I
do
it
out
of
*NL*
niggardliness
,
to
escape
paying
him
the
wages
I
owe
him
,
and
before
God
,
*NL*
and
on
my
soul
,
he
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lies
before
me
,
base
clown
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
``
By
the
sun
that
shines
*NL*
on
us
I
have
a
mind
to
run
you
through
with
this
lance
.
Pay
him
at
once
*NL*
without
another
word
;
if
not
,
by
the
God
that
rules
us
I
will
make
an
end
*NL*
of
you
,
and
annihilate
you
on
the
spot
;
release
him
instantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
farmer
hung
his
head
,
and
without
a
word
untied
his
servant
,
of
whom
*NL*
Don
Quixote
asked
how
much
his
master
owed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
nine
months
at
seven
reals
a
month
.
Don
Quixote
added
it
up
,
*NL*
found
that
it
came
to
sixty-three
reals
,
and
told
the
farmer
to
pay
it
*NL*
down
immediately
,
if
he
did
not
want
to
die
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trembling
clown
replied
that
as
he
lived
and
by
the
oath
he
had
sworn
*NL*
-LRB-
though
he
had
not
sworn
any
-RRB-
it
was
not
so
much
;
for
there
were
to
be
*NL*
taken
into
account
and
deducted
three
pairs
of
shoes
he
had
given
him
,
*NL*
and
a
real
for
two
blood-lettings
when
he
was
sick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
is
very
well
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
let
the
shoes
and
the
*NL*
blood-lettings
stand
as
a
setoff
against
the
blows
you
have
given
him
*NL*
without
any
cause
;
for
if
he
spoiled
the
leather
of
the
shoes
you
paid
*NL*
for
,
you
have
damaged
that
of
his
body
,
and
if
the
barber
took
blood
from
*NL*
him
when
he
was
sick
,
you
have
drawn
it
when
he
was
sound
;
so
on
that
*NL*
score
he
owes
you
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
difficulty
is
,
Sir
Knight
,
that
I
have
no
money
here
;
let
Andres
*NL*
come
home
with
me
,
and
I
will
pay
him
all
,
real
by
real

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
go
with
him
!
''
said
the
youth
.
``
Nay
,
God
forbid
!
No

senor
,
not
for
the
*NL*
world

for
once
alone

,
he
would
ray
me
like
a
Saint
Bartholomew

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind

said
Don
Quixote
;
``
I
have
only
to
*NL*
command
,
and
he
will
obey
me

as
he
has
sworn
to
me
by
the
order

*NL*
knighthood
which
he
has
received

I
leave
him
free

payment

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Consider
what
you
are
saying
,
senor
,
''
said
the
youth
;
``
this
master
of
*NL*
mine
is
not
a
knight
,
nor
has
he
received
any
order
of
knighthood

he
*NL*
is
Juan
Haldudo
the
Rich
,
of
Quintanar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
matters
little
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
there
may
be
Haldudos
*NL*
knights
;
moreover
,
everyone
is
the
son
of
his
works

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Andres
;
``
but
this
master
of
mine

of
what
works
is
*NL*
he
the
son

when
he
refuses
me
the

of
my
sweat
and
labour

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
refuse
,
brother
Andres

''
said
the
farmer
,
``
be
good
enough
to
*NL*
come
along
with
me
,
and
I
swear
by
all
the
orders

are
*NL*
in
the
world
to
pay
you
as
I
have
agreed
,
real

,
and
perfumed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
perfumery
I
excuse
you
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
give
it
to
him
in
*NL*
reals
,
and
I
shall
be
satisfied
;
and
see
that
you
do
as
you
have
sworn
;
*NL*
if
not
,
by
the
same
oath
I
swear
to
come
back
and
hunt
you
out
and
punish
*NL*
you
;
and
I
shall
find
you
though
you
should
lie
closer
than
a
lizard
.
And
*NL*
if
you
desire
to
know
who
it
is
lays
this
command
upon
you
,
that
you
be
*NL*
more
firmly
bound
to
obey
it
,
know
that
I
am
the
valorous
Don

of
*NL*
La

,
the
undoer
of
wrongs
and
injustices
;
and
so
,
God
be
with
you
,
*NL*
and
keep
in
mind
what
you
have
promised
and
sworn
under
those
penalties
*NL*
that
have
been
already
declared
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
gave
Rocinante
the
spur
and
was
soon
out
of
reach
.
The
*NL*
farmer
followed
him
with
his
eyes
,
and
when
he
saw
that
he
had
cleared
*NL*
the
wood
and
was
no
longer
in
sight
,
he
turned
to
his
boy
Andres
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Come
here
,
my
son
,
I
want
to
pay
you
what
I
owe
you
,
as
that
*NL*
undoer
of
wrongs
has
commanded
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
oath
on
it
,
''
said
Andres
,
``
your
worship
will
be
well
advised
to
obey
*NL*
the
command
of
that
good
knight
--
may
he
live
a
thousand
years
--
for
,
as
he
*NL*
is
a
valiant
and
just
judge
,
by
Roque
,
if
you
do
not
pay
me
,
he
will
come
*NL*
back
and
do
as
he
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
oath
on
it
,
too
,
''
said
the
farmer
;
``
but
as
I
have
a
strong
affection
*NL*
for
you
,
I
want
to
add
to
the
debt
in
order
to
add
to
the
payment
;
''
and
*NL*
seizing
him
by
the
arm
,
he
tied
him
up
again
,
and
gave
him
such
a
*NL*
flogging
that
he
left
him
for
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Master
Andres
,
''
said
the
farmer
,
``
call
on
the
undoer
of
wrongs
;
you
*NL*
will
find
he
wo
n't
undo
that
,
though
I
am
not
sure
that
I
have
quite
done
*NL*
with
you
,
for
I
have
a
good
mind
to
flay
you
alive
.
''
But
at
last
he
*NL*
untied
him
,
and
gave
him
leave
to
go
look
for
his
judge
in
order
to
put
*NL*
the
sentence
pronounced
into
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Andres
went
off
rather
down
in
the
mouth
,
swearing
he
would
go
to
look
*NL*
for
the
valiant
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
and
tell
him
exactly
what
had
*NL*
happened
,
and
that
all
would
have
to
be
repaid
him
sevenfold
;
but
for
all
*NL*
that
,
he
went
off
weeping
,
while
his
master
stood
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
did
the
valiant
Don
Quixote
right
that
wrong
,
and
,
thoroughly
*NL*
satisfied
with
what
had
taken
place
,
as
he
considered
he
had
made
a
very
*NL*
happy
and
noble
beginning
with
his
knighthood
,
he
took
the
road
towards
*NL*
his
village
in
perfect
self-content
,
saying
in
a
low
voice
,
``
Well
mayest
*NL*
thou
this
day
call
thyself
fortunate
above
all
on
earth
,
O
Dulcinea
del
*NL*
Toboso
,
fairest
of
the
fair
!
since
it
has
fallen
to
thy
lot
to
hold
*NL*
subject
and
submissive
to
thy
full
will
and
pleasure
a
knight
so
renowned
*NL*
as
is
and
will
be
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
who
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
*NL*
yesterday
received
the
order
of
knighthood
,
and
hath
to-day
righted
the
*NL*
greatest
wrong
and
grievance
that
ever
injustice
conceived
and
cruelty
*NL*
perpetrated
:
who
hath
to-day
plucked
the
rod
from
the
hand
of
yonder
*NL*
ruthless
oppressor
so
wantonly
lashing
that
tender
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
came
to
a
road
branching
in
four
directions
,
and
immediately
he
*NL*
was
reminded
of
those
cross-roads
where
knights-errant
used
to
stop
to
*NL*
consider
which
road
they
should
take
.
In
imitation
of
them
he
halted
for
*NL*
a
while
,
and
after
having
deeply
considered
it
,
he
gave
Rocinante
his
*NL*
head
,
submitting
his
own
will
to
that
of
his
hack
,
who
followed
out
his
*NL*
first
intention
,
which
was
to
make
straight
for
his
own
stable
.
After
he
*NL*
had
gone
about
two
miles
Don
Quixote
perceived
a
large
party
of
people
,
*NL*
who
,
as
afterwards
appeared
,
were
some
Toledo
traders
,
on
their
way
to
*NL*
buy
silk
at
Murcia
.
There
were
six
of
them
coming
along
under
their
*NL*
sunshades
,
with
four
servants
mounted
,
and
three
muleteers
on
foot
.
*NL*
Scarcely
had
Don
Quixote
descried
them
when
the
fancy
possessed
him
that
*NL*
this
must
be
some
new
adventure
;
and
to
help
him
to
imitate
as
far
as
he
*NL*
could
those
passages
he
had
read
of
in
his
books
,
here
seemed
to
come
one
*NL*
made
on
purpose
,
which
he
resolved
to
attempt
.
So
with
a
lofty
bearing
*NL*
and
determination
he
fixed
himself
firmly
in
his
stirrups
,
got
his
lance
*NL*
ready
,
brought
his
buckler
before
his
breast
,
and
planting
himself
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
road
,
stood
waiting
the
approach
of
these
knights-errant
,
*NL*
for
such
he
now
considered
and
held
them
to
be
;
and
when
they
had
come
*NL*
near
enough
to
see
and
hear
,
he
exclaimed
with
a
haughty
gesture
,
``
All
*NL*
the
world
stand
,
unless
all
the
world
confess
that
in
all
the
world
there
*NL*
is
no
maiden
fairer
than
the
Empress
of
La
Mancha
,
the
peerless
Dulcinea
*NL*
del
Toboso
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
traders
halted
at
the
sound
of
this
language
and
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
strange
figure
that
uttered
it
,
and
from
both
figure
and
language
at
once
*NL*
guessed
the
craze
of
their
owner
;
they
wished
,
however
,
to
learn
quietly
*NL*
what
was
the
object
of
this
confession
that
was
demanded
of
them
,
and
one
*NL*
of
them
,
who
was
rather
fond
of
a
joke
and
was
very
sharp-witted
,
said
to
*NL*
him
,
``
Sir
Knight
,
we
do
not
know
who
this
good
lady
is
that
you
speak
of

show
her

us
,
for
,
if
she
be
of
such
beauty
as
you
suggest
,
with
all
*NL*
our
hearts
and
without
any
pressure
we
will
confess
the
truth
that
is
on
*NL*
your
part
required
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
to
show
her
to
you
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
what
merit
would
*NL*
you
have
in
confessing
a
truth
so
manifest
?
The
essential
point
is
that
*NL*
without
seeing
her
you
must
believe
,
confess
,
affirm
,
swear
,
and
defend
*NL*
it
;
else
ye
have
to
do
with
me
in
battle

ill-conditioned

arrogant
*NL*
rabble

ye
are
;

come
ye
on

one
by

requires

all
together

your
breed

here
do
I
bide

await
you

the
justice
of
the
cause
I

maintain

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Knight

replied
the
trader
,
``
I
entreat
your
worship

company

charging
our

confession

one
moreover

much

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
distils
nothing

said
Don

,
burning
*NL*
with
rage
,
``
nothing

only
ambergris

straighter

of
my
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
saying
,
he
charged
with
levelled
lance
against
the
one
who
had
*NL*
spoken
,
with
such
fury
and
fierceness
that
,
if
luck
had
not
contrived
*NL*
that
Rocinante
should
stumble
midway
and
come
down
,
it
would
have
gone
*NL*
hard
with
the
rash
trader
.
Down
went
Rocinante
,
and
over
went
his
master
,
*NL*
rolling
along
the
ground
for
some
distance
;
and
when
he
tried
to
rise
he
*NL*
was
unable
,
so
encumbered
was
he
with
lance
,
buckler
,
spurs
,
helmet
,
and
*NL*
the
weight
of
his
old
armour
;
and
all
the
while
he
was
struggling
to
get
*NL*
up
he
kept
saying
,
``
Fly
not
,
cowards
and
caitiffs
!
stay
,
for
not
by
my
*NL*
fault
,
but
my
horse
's
,
am
I
stretched
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
muleteers
in
attendance
,
who
could
not
have
had
much
good
*NL*
nature
in
him
,
hearing
the
poor
prostrate
man
blustering
in
this
style
,
*NL*
was
unable
to
refrain
from
giving
him
an
answer
on
his
ribs
;
and
coming
*NL*
up
to
him
he
seized
his
lance
,
and
having
broken
it
in
pieces
,
with
one
*NL*
of
them
he
began
so
to
belabour
our
Don
Quixote
that
,
notwithstanding
and
*NL*
in
spite
of
his
armour
,
he
milled
him
like
a
measure
of
wheat
.
His
*NL*
masters
called
out
not
to
lay
on
so
hard
and
to
leave
him
alone
,
but
the
*NL*
muleteers
blood
was
up
,
and
he
did
not
care
to
drop
the
game
until
he
had
*NL*
vented
the
rest
of
his
wrath
,
and
gathering
up
the
remaining
fragments
of
*NL*
the
lance
he
finished
with
a
discharge
upon
the
unhappy
victim
,
who
all
*NL*
through
the
storm
of
sticks
that
rained
on
him
never
ceased
threatening
*NL*
heaven
,
and
earth
,
and
the
brigands
,
for
such
they
seemed
to
him
.
At
last
*NL*
the
muleteer
was
tired
,
and
the
traders
continued
their
journey
,
taking
*NL*
with
them
matter
for
talk
about
the
poor
fellow
who
had
been
cudgelled
.
*NL*
He
when
he
found
himself
alone
made
another
effort
to
rise
;
but
if
he
was
*NL*
unable
when
whole
and
sound
,
how
was
he
to
rise
after
having
been
*NL*
thrashed
and
well-nigh
knocked
to
pieces
?
And
yet
he
esteemed
himself
*NL*
fortunate
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
was
a
regular
knight-errant
's
*NL*
mishap
,
and
entirely
,
he
considered
,
the
fault
of
his
horse
.
However
,
*NL*
battered
in
body
as
he
was
,
to
rise
was
beyond
his
power
.

CHAPTER
V
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
THE
NARRATIVE
OF
OUR
KNIGHT
'S
MISHAP
IS
CONTINUED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
,
then
,
that
,
in
fact
he
could
not
move
,
he
thought
himself
of
*NL*
having
recourse
to
his
usual
remedy
,
which
was
to
think
of
some
passage
*NL*
in
his
books
,
and
his
craze
brought
to
his
mind
that
about
Baldwin
and
*NL*
the
Marquis
of
Mantua
,
when
Carloto
left
him
wounded
on
the
mountain
*NL*
side
,
a
story
known
by
heart
by
the
children
,
not
forgotten
by
the
young
*NL*
men
,
and
lauded
and
even
believed
by
the
old
folk
;
and
for
all
that
not
a
*NL*
whit
truer
than
the
miracles
of
Mahomet
.
This
seemed
to
him
to
fit
*NL*
exactly
the
case
in
which
he
found
himself
,
so
,
making
a
show
of
severe
*NL*
suffering
,
he
began
to
roll
on
the
ground
and
with
feeble
breath
repeat
*NL*
the
very
words
which
the
wounded
knight
of
the
wood
is
said
to
have
*NL*
uttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
Where
art
thou
,
lady
mine
,
that
thou
*NL*
My
sorrow
dost
not
rue
?
*NL*
Thou
canst
not
know
it
,
lady
mine
,
*NL*
Or
else
thou
art
untrue
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
went
on
with
the
ballad
as
far
as
the
lines
:
*NL*
*NL*
O
noble
Marquis
of
Mantua
,
*NL*
My
Uncle
and
liege
lord
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
chance
would
have
it
,
when
he
had
got
to
this
line
there
happened
to
*NL*
come
by
a
peasant
from
his
own
village
,
a
neighbour
of
his
,
who
had
been
*NL*
with
a
load
of
wheat
to
the
mill
,
and
he
,
seeing
the
man
stretched
there
,
*NL*
came
up
to
him
and
asked
him
who
he
was
and
what
was
the
matter
with
him
*NL*
that
he
complained
so
dolefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
firmly
persuaded
that
this
was
the
Marquis
of
Mantua
,
his
*NL*
uncle
,
so
the
only
answer
he
made
was
to
go
on
with
his
ballad
,
in
which
*NL*
he
told
the
tale
of
his
misfortune
,
and
of
the
loves
of
the
Emperor
's
son
*NL*
and
his
wife
all
exactly
as
the
ballad
sings
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasant
stood
amazed
at
hearing
such
nonsense
,
and
relieving
him
of
*NL*
the
visor
,
already
battered
to
pieces
by
blows
,
he
wiped
his
face
,
which
*NL*
was
covered
with
dust
,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
done
so
he
recognised
him
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Senor
Quixada
''
-LRB-
for
so
he
appears
to
have
been
called
when
he
*NL*
was
in
his
senses
and
had
not
yet
changed
from
a
quiet
country
gentleman
*NL*
into
a
knight-errant
-RRB-
,
``
who
has
brought
your
worship
to
this
pass
?
''
But
*NL*
to
all
questions
the
other
only
went
on
with
his
ballad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
this
,
the
good
man
removed
as
well
as
he
could
his
breastplate
and
*NL*
backpiece
to
see
if
he
had
any
wound
,
but
he
could
perceive
no
blood
nor
*NL*
any
mark
whatever
.
He
then
contrived
to
raise
him
from
the
ground
,
and
*NL*
with
no
little
difficulty
hoisted
him
upon
his
ass
,
which
seemed
to
him
*NL*
to
be
the
easiest
mount
for
him
;
and
collecting
the
arms
,
even
to
the
*NL*
splinters
of
the
lance
,
he
tied
them
on
Rocinante
,
and
leading
him
by
the
*NL*
bridle
and
the
ass
by
the
halter
he
took
the
road
for
the
village
,
very
*NL*
sad
to
hear
what
absurd
stuff
Don
Quixote
was
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
Don
Quixote
less
so
,
for
what
with
blows
and
bruises
he
could
not
*NL*
sit
upright
on
the
ass
,
and
from
time
to
time
he
sent
up
sighs
to
heaven
,
*NL*
so
that
once
more
he
drove
the
peasant
to
ask
what
ailed
him
.
And
it
*NL*
could
have
been
only
the
devil
himself
that
put
into
his
head
tales
to
*NL*
match
his
own
adventures
,
for
now
,
forgetting
Baldwin
,
he
bethought
*NL*
himself
of
the
Moor
Abindarraez
,
when
the
Alcaide
of
Antequera
,
Rodrigo
*NL*
de
Narvaez
,
took
him
prisoner
and
carried
him
away
to
his
castle
;
so
that
*NL*
when
the
peasant
again
asked
him
how
he
was
and
what
ailed
him
,
he
gave
*NL*
him
for
reply
the
same
words
and
phrases
that
the
captive
Abindarraez
*NL*
gave
to
Rodrigo
de
Narvaez
,
just
as
he
had
read
the
story
in
the
``
Diana
''
*NL*
of
Jorge
de
Montemayor
where
it
is
written
,
applying
it
to
his
own
case
*NL*
so
aptly
that
the
peasant
went
along
cursing
his
fate
that
he
had
to
*NL*
listen
to
such
a
lot
of
nonsense
;
from
which
,
however
,
he
came
to
the
*NL*
conclusion
that
his
neighbour
was
mad
,
and
so
made
all
haste
to
reach
the
*NL*
village
to
escape
the
wearisomeness
of
this
harangue
of
Don
Quixote
's
;
*NL*
who
,
at
the
end
of
it
,
said
,
``
Senor
Don
Rodrigo
de
Narvaez
,
your
worship
*NL*
must
know
that
this
fair
Xarifa
I
have
mentioned
is
now
the
lovely
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
for
whom
I
have
done
,
am
doing
,
and
will
do
the
most
*NL*
famous
deeds
of
chivalry
that
in
this
world
have
been
seen
,
are
to
be
*NL*
seen
,
or
ever
shall
be
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
peasant
answered
,
``
Senor
--
sinner
that
I
am
!
--
can
not
your
*NL*
worship
see
that
I
am
not
Don
Rodrigo
de
Narvaez
nor
the
Marquis
of
*NL*
Mantua
,
but
Pedro
Alonso
your
neighbour
,
and
that
your
worship
is
neither
*NL*
Baldwin
nor
Abindarraez
,
but
the
worthy
gentleman
Senor
Quixada
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
who
I
am
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
I
know
that
I
may
be
not
*NL*
only
those
I
have
named
,
but
all
the
Twelve
Peers
of
France
and
even
all
*NL*
the
Nine
Worthies
,
since
my
achievements
surpass
all
that
they
have
done
*NL*
all
together
and
each
of
them
on
his
own
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
talk
and
more
of
the
same
kind
they
reached
the
village
just
as
*NL*
night
was
beginning
to
fall
,
but
the
peasant
waited
until
it
was
a
little
*NL*
later
that
the
belaboured
gentleman
might
not
be
seen
riding
in
such
a
*NL*
miserable
trim
.
When
it
was
what
seemed
to
him
the
proper
time
he
entered
*NL*
the
village
and
went
to
Don
Quixote
's
house
,
which
he
found
all
in
*NL*
confusion
,
and
there
were
the
curate
and
the
village
barber
,
who
were
*NL*
great
friends
of
Don
Quixote
,
and
his
housekeeper
was
saying
to
them
in
a
*NL*
loud
voice
,
``
What
does
your
worship
think
can
have
befallen
my
master
,
*NL*
Senor
Licentiate
Pero
Perez
?
''
for
so
the
curate
was
called
;
``
it
is
three
*NL*
days
now
since
anything
has
been
seen
of
him
,
or
the
hack
,
or
the
*NL*
buckler
,
lance
,
or
armour
.
Miserable
me
!
I
am
certain
of
it
,
and
it
is
as
*NL*
true
as
that
I
was
born
to
die
,
that
these
accursed
books
of
chivalry
he
*NL*
has
,
and
has
got
into
the
way
of
reading
so
constantly
,
have
upset
his
*NL*
reason
;
for
now
I
remember
having
often
heard
him
saying
to
himself
that
*NL*
he
would
turn
knight-errant
and
go
all
over
the
world
in
quest
of
*NL*
adventures
.
To
the
devil
and
Barabbas
with
such
books
,
that
have
brought
*NL*
to
ruin
in
this
way
the
finest
understanding
there
was
in
all
La
Mancha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
niece
said
the
same
,
and
,
more
:
``
You
must
know
,
Master
Nicholas
''
--
for
*NL*
that
was
the
name
of
the
barber
--
``
it
was
often
my
uncle
's
way
to
stay
two
*NL*
days
and
nights
together
poring
over
these
unholy
books
of
misventures
,
*NL*
after
which
he
would
fling
the
book
away
and
snatch
up
his
sword
and
fall
*NL*
to
slashing
the
walls
;
and
when
he
was
tired
out
he
would
say
he
had
*NL*
killed
four
giants
like
four
towers
;
and
the
sweat
that
flowed
from
him
*NL*
when
he
was
weary
he
said
was
the
blood
of
the
wounds
he
had
received
in
*NL*
battle
;
and
then
he
would
drink
a
great
jug
of
cold
water
and
become
calm
*NL*
and
quiet
,
saying
that
this
water
was
a
most
precious
potion
which
the
*NL*
sage
Esquife
,
a
great
magician
and
friend
of
his
,
had
brought
him
.
But
I
*NL*
take
all
the
blame
upon
myself
for
never
having
told
your
worships
of
my
*NL*
uncle
's
vagaries
,
that
you
might
put
a
stop
to
them
before
things
had
*NL*
come
to
this
pass
,
and
burn
all
these
accursed
books
--
for
he
has
a
great
*NL*
number
--
that
richly
deserve
to
be
burned
like
heretics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
say
I
too
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
and
by
my
faith
to-morrow
shall
not
*NL*
pass
without
public
judgment
upon
them
,
and
may
they
be
condemned
to
the
*NL*
flames
lest
they
lead
those
that
read
to
behave
as
my
good
friend
seems
*NL*
to
have
behaved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
the
peasant
heard
,
and
from
it
he
understood
at
last
what
was
*NL*
the
matter
with
his
neighbour
,
so
he
began
calling
aloud
,
``
Open
,
your
*NL*
worships
,
to
Senor
Baldwin
and
to
Senor
the
Marquis
of
Mantua
,
who
comes
*NL*
badly
wounded
,
and
to
Senor
Abindarraez
,
the
Moor
,
whom
the
valiant
*NL*
Rodrigo
de
Narvaez
,
the
Alcaide
of
Antequera
,
brings
captive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
they
all
hurried
out
,
and
when
they
recognised
their
*NL*
friend
,
master
,
and
uncle
,
who
had
not
yet
dismounted
from
the
ass
*NL*
because
he
could
not
,
they
ran
to
embrace
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
said
he
,
``
for
I
am
badly
wounded
through
my
horse
's
fault
;
carry
*NL*
me
to
bed
,
and
if
possible
send
for
the
wise
Urganda
to
cure
and
see
to
*NL*
my
wounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
there
!
plague
on
it
!
''
cried
the
housekeeper
at
this
:
``
did
not
my
*NL*
heart
tell
the
truth
as
to
which
foot
my
master
went
lame
of
?
To
bed
with
*NL*
your
worship
at
once
,
and
we
will
contrive
to
cure
you
here
without
*NL*
fetching
that
Hurgada
.
A
curse
I
say
once
more
,
and
a
hundred
times
more
,
*NL*
on
those
books
of
chivalry
that
have
brought
your
worship
to
such
a
*NL*
pass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
carried
him
to
bed
at
once
,
and
after
searching
for
his
wounds
could
*NL*
find
none
,
but
he
said
they
were
all
bruises
from
having
had
a
severe
*NL*
fall
with
his
horse
Rocinante
when
in
combat
with
ten
giants
,
the
biggest
*NL*
and
the
boldest
to
be
found
on
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
so
!
''
said
the
curate
,
``
are
there
giants
in
the
dance
?
By
the
sign
of
*NL*
the
Cross
I
will
burn
them
to-morrow
before
the
day
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
put
a
host
of
questions
to
Don
Quixote
,
but
his
only
answer
to
all
*NL*
was
--
give
him
something
to
eat
,
and
leave
him
to
sleep
,
for
that
was
what
*NL*
he
needed
most
.
They
did
so
,
and
the
curate
questioned
the
peasant
at
*NL*
great
length
as
to
how
he
had
found
Don
Quixote
.
He
told
him

and
the
*NL*
nonsense
he
had
talked
when
found
and
on
the
way
home
,
all
which
made
the
*NL*
licentiate
the
more
eager
to
do
what
he
did
the
next
day
,
which
was
to
*NL*
summon
his
friend
the
barber
,
Master
Nicholas

go
with
him

CHAPTER
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
DIVERTING
AND
IMPORTANT
SCRUTINY
WHICH
THE
CURATE
AND
THE
BARBER
*NL*
MADE
IN
THE
LIBRARY
OF
OUR
INGENIOUS
GENTLEMAN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
sleeping
;
so
the
curate
asked
the
niece
for
the
keys
of
the
*NL*
room
where
the
books
,
the
authors
of
all
the
mischief
,
were
,
and
right
*NL*
willingly
she
gave
them
.
They
all
went
in
,
the
housekeeper
with
them
,
and
*NL*
found
more
than
a
hundred
volumes
of
big
books
very
well
bound
,
and
some
*NL*
other
small
ones
.
The
moment
the
housekeeper
saw
them
she
turned
about
*NL*
and
ran
out
of
the
room
,
and
came
back
immediately
with
a
saucer
of
holy
*NL*
water
and
a
sprinkler
,
saying
,
``
Here
,
your
worship
,
senor
licentiate
,
*NL*
sprinkle
this
room
;
do
n't
leave
any
magician
of
the
many
there
are
in
*NL*
these
books
to
bewitch
us
in
revenge
for
our
design
of
banishing
them
*NL*
from
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
simplicity
of
the
housekeeper
made
the
licentiate
laugh
,
and
he
*NL*
directed
the
barber
to
give
him
the
books
one
by
one
to
see
what
they
*NL*
were
about
,
as
there
might
be
some
to
be
found
among
them
that
did
not
*NL*
deserve
the
penalty
of
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
niece
,
``
there
is
no
reason
for
showing
mercy
to
any
of
*NL*
them
;
they
have
every
one
of
them
done
mischief
;
better
fling
them
out
of
*NL*
the
window
into
the
court
and
make
a
pile
of
them
and
set
fire
to
them
;
*NL*
or
else
carry
them
into
the
yard
,
and
there
a
bonfire
can
be
made
without
*NL*
the
smoke
giving
any
annoyance
.
''
The
housekeeper
said
the
same
,
so
eager
*NL*
were
they
both
for
the
slaughter
of
those
innocents
,
but
the
curate
would
*NL*
not
agree
to
it
without
first
reading
at
any
rate
the
titles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
that
Master
Nicholas
put
into
his
hand
was
``
The
four
books
of
*NL*
Amadis
of
Gaul
.
''
``
This
seems
a
mysterious
thing
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
for
,
*NL*
as
I
have
heard
say
,
this
was
the
first
book
of
chivalry
printed
in
*NL*
Spain
,
and
from
this
all
the
others
derive
their
birth
and
origin
;
so
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
inexorably
to
condemn
it
to
the
flames
as
the
*NL*
founder
of
so
vile
a
sect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
I
too
,
have
heard
say
that
this
is
the
best
*NL*
of
all
the
books
of
this
kind
that
have
been
written
,
and
so
,
as
*NL*
something
singular
in
its
line
,
it
ought
to
be
pardoned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
and
for
that
reason
let
its
life
be
spared
for
*NL*
the
present
.
Let
us
see
that
other
which
is
next
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
the
`
Sergas
de
Esplandian
,
'
the
lawful
son
of
*NL*
Amadis
of
Gaul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
verily
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
the
merit
of
the
father
must
not
be
put
*NL*
down
to
the
account
of
the
son
.
Take
it
,
mistress
housekeeper
;
open
the
*NL*
window
and
fling
it
into
the
yard
and
lay
the
foundation
of
the
pile
for
*NL*
the
bonfire
we
are
to
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
housekeeper
obeyed
with
great
satisfaction
,
and
the
worthy
*NL*
``
Esplandian
''
went
flying
into
the
yard
to
await
with
all
patience
the
*NL*
fire
that
was
in
store
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed
,
''
said
the
curate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
that
comes
next
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
is
`
Amadis
of
Greece
,
'
and
,
*NL*
indeed
,
I
believe
all
those
on
this
side
are
of
the
same
Amadis
lineage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
to
the
yard
with
the
whole
of
them
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
for
to
have
*NL*
the
burning
of
Queen
Pintiquiniestra
,
and
the
shepherd
Darinel
and
his
*NL*
eclogues
,
and
the
bedevilled
and
involved
discourses
of
his
author
,
I
*NL*
would
burn
with
them
the
father
who
begot
me
if
he
were
going
about
in
*NL*
the
guise
of
a
knight-errant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
of
the
same
mind
,
''
said
the
barber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
am
I
,
''
added
the
niece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
the
housekeeper
,
``
here
,
into
the
yard
with
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
handed
to
her
,
and
as
there
were
many
of
them
,
she
spared
*NL*
herself
the
staircase
,
and
flung
them
down
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
tub
there
?
''
said
the
curate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
is
`
Don
Olivante
de
Laura
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
author
of
that
book
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
was
the
same
that
wrote
`
The
*NL*
Garden
of
Flowers
,
'
and
truly
there
is
no
deciding
which
of
the
two
books
*NL*
is
the
more
truthful
,
or
,
to
put
it
better
,
the
less
lying
;
all
I
can
say
*NL*
is
,
send
this
one
into
the
yard
for
a
swaggering
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
that
follows
is
`
Florismarte
of
Hircania
,
'
''
said
the
barber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
Florismarte
here
?
''
said
the
curate
;
``
then
by
my
faith
he
must
take
*NL*
up
his
quarters
in
the
yard
,
in
spite
of
his
marvellous
birth
and
*NL*
visionary
adventures
,
for
the
stiffness
and
dryness
of
his
style
deserve
*NL*
nothing
else
;
into
the
yard
with
him
and
the
other
,
mistress
*NL*
housekeeper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
senor
,
''
said
she
,
and
executed
the
order
with
great
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
is
The
Knight
Platir
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
book
that
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
but
I
find
no
reason
for
clemency
*NL*
in
it
;
send
it
after
the
others
without
appeal
;
''
which
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
book
was
opened
,
and
they
saw
it
was
entitled
,
``
The
Knight
of
the
*NL*
Cross
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
sake
of
the
holy
name
this
book
has
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
its
*NL*
ignorance
might
be
excused
;
but
then
,
they
say
,
`
behind
the
cross
there
's
*NL*
the
devil
;
to
the
fire
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
down
another
book
,
the
barber
said
,
``
This
is
`
The
Mirror
of
*NL*
Chivalry
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
his
worship
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
that
is
where
Senor
Reinaldos
of
*NL*
Montalvan
figures
with
his
friends
and
comrades
,
greater
thieves
than
*NL*
Cacus
,
and
the
Twelve
Peers
of
France
with
the
veracious
historian
*NL*
Turpin
;
however
,
I
am
not
for
condemning
them
to
more
than
perpetual
*NL*
banishment
,
because
,
at
any
rate
,
they
have
some
share
in
the
invention
*NL*
of
the
famous
Matteo
Boiardo
,
whence
too
the
Christian
poet
Ludovico
*NL*
Ariosto
wove
his
web
,
to
whom
,
if
I
find
him
here
,
and
speaking
any
*NL*
language
but
his
own
,
I
shall
show
no
respect
whatever
;
but
if
he
speaks
*NL*
his
own
tongue
I
will
put
him
upon
my
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
him
in
Italian
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
but
I
do
not
understand
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
would
it
be
well
that
you
should
understand
him
,
''
said
the
curate
,
*NL*
``
and
on
that
score
we
might
have
excused
the
Captain
if
he
had
not
*NL*
brought
him
into
Spain
and
turned
him
into
Castilian
.
He
robbed
him
of
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
his
natural
force
,
and
so
do
all
those
who
try
to
turn
*NL*
books
written
in
verse
into
another
language
,
for
,
with
all
the
pains
*NL*
they
take
and
all
the
cleverness
they
show
,
they
never
can
reach
the
*NL*
level
of
the
originals
as
they
were
first
produced
.
In
short
,
I
say
that
*NL*
this
book
,
and
all
that
may
be
found
treating
of
those
French
affairs
,
*NL*
should
be
thrown
into
or
deposited
in
some
dry
well
,
until
after
more
*NL*
consideration
it
is
settled
what
is
to
be
done
with
them
;
excepting
*NL*
always
one
`
Bernardo
del
Carpio
'
that
is
going
about
,
and
another
called
*NL*
`
Roncesvalles
;
'
for
these
,
if
they
come
into
my
hands
,
shall
pass
at
once
*NL*
into
those
of
the
housekeeper
,
and
from
hers
into
the
fire
without
any
*NL*
reprieve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
the
barber
gave
his
assent
,
and
looked
upon
it
as
right
and
*NL*
proper
,
being
persuaded
that
the
curate
was
so
staunch
to
the
Faith
and
*NL*
loyal
to
the
Truth
that
he
would
not
for
the
world
say
anything
opposed
*NL*
to
them
.
Opening
another
book
he
saw
it
was
``
Palmerin
de
Oliva
,
''
and
*NL*
beside
it
was
another
called
``
Palmerin
of
England
,
''
seeing
which
the
*NL*
licentiate
said
,
``
Let
the
Olive
be
made
firewood
of
at
once
and
burned
*NL*
until
no
ashes
even
are
left
;
and
let
that
Palm
of
England
be
kept
and
*NL*
preserved
as
a
thing
that
stands
alone
,
and
let
such
another
case
be
made
*NL*
for
it
as
that
which
Alexander
found
among
the
spoils
of
Darius
and
set
*NL*
aside
for
the
safe
keeping
of
the
works
of
the
poet
Homer
.
This
book
,
*NL*
gossip
,
is
of
authority
for
two
reasons
,
first
because
it
is
very
good
,
*NL*
and
secondly
because
it
is
said
to
have
been
written
by
a
wise
and
witty
*NL*
king
of
Portugal
.
All
the
adventures
at
the
Castle
of
Miraguarda
are
*NL*
excellent
and
of
admirable
contrivance
,
and
the
language
is
polished
and
*NL*
clear
,
studying
and
observing
the
style
befitting
the
speaker
with
*NL*
propriety
and
judgment
.
So
then
,
provided
it
seems
good
to
you
,
Master
*NL*
Nicholas
,
I
say
let
this
and
`
Amadis
of
Gaul
'
be
remitted
the
penalty
of
*NL*
fire
,
and
as
for
all
the
rest
,
let
them
perish
without
further
question
*NL*
or
query
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
gossip
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
for
this
that
I
have
here
is
the
famous
*NL*
`
Don
Belianis
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
that
and
the
second
,
third
,
and
fourth
parts
*NL*
all
stand
in
need
of
a
little
rhubarb
to
purge
their
excess
of
bile
,
and
*NL*
they
must
be
cleared
of
all
that
stuff
about
the
Castle
of
Fame
and
other
*NL*
greater
affectations
,
to
which
end
let
them
be
allowed
the
over-seas
*NL*
term
,
and
,
according
as
they
mend
,
so
shall
mercy
or
justice
be
meted
out
*NL*
to
them
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
gossip
,
do
you
keep
them
in
your
house
and
*NL*
let
no
one
read
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
said
the
barber
;
and
not
caring
to
tire
himself
with
*NL*
reading
more
books
of
chivalry
,
he
told
the
housekeeper
to
take
all
the
*NL*
big
ones
and
throw
them
into
the
yard
.
It
was
not
said
to
one
dull
or
*NL*
deaf
,
but
to
one
who
enjoyed
burning
them
more
than
weaving
the
broadest
*NL*
and
finest
web
that
could
be
;
and
seizing
about
eight
at
a
time
,
she
*NL*
flung
them
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
carrying
so
many
together
she
let
one
fall
at
the
feet
of
the
barber
,
*NL*
who
took
it
up
,
curious
to
know
whose
it
was
,
and
found
it
said
,
``
History
*NL*
of
the
Famous
Knight
,
Tirante
el
Blanco
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
me
!
''
said
the
curate
with
a
shout
,
''
`
Tirante
el
Blanco
'
here
!
*NL*
Hand
it
over
,
gossip
,
for
in
it
I
reckon
I
have
found
a
treasury
of
*NL*
enjoyment
and
a
mine
of
recreation
.
Here
is
Don
Kyrieleison
of
Montalvan
,
*NL*
a
valiant
knight
,
and
his
brother
Thomas
of
Montalvan
,
and
the
knight
*NL*
Fonseca
,
with
the
battle
the
bold
Tirante
fought
with
the
mastiff
,
and
*NL*
the
witticisms
of
the
damsel
Placerdemivida
,
and
the
loves
and
wiles
of
*NL*
the
widow
Reposada
,
and
the
empress
in
love
with
the
squire
Hipolito
--
in
*NL*
truth
,
gossip
,
by
right
of
its
style
it
is
the
best
book
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Here
knights
eat
and
sleep
,
and
die
in
their
beds
,
and
make
their
wills
*NL*
before
dying
,
and
a
great
deal
more
of
which
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
*NL*
other
books
.
Nevertheless
,
I
say
he
who
wrote
it
,
for
deliberately
*NL*
composing
such
fooleries
,
deserves
to
be
sent
to
the
galleys
for
life
.
*NL*
Take
it
home
with
you
and
read
it
,
and
you
will
see
that
what
I
have
said
*NL*
is
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
will
,
''
said
the
barber
;
``
but
what
are
we
to
do
with
these
little
*NL*
books
that
are
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
must
be
,
not
chivalry
,
but
poetry
,
''
said
the
curate
;
and
opening
*NL*
one
he
saw
it
was
the
``
Diana
''
of
Jorge
de
Montemayor
,
and
,
supposing
all
*NL*
the

these

he
said
,
``
do
not
deserve

neither

the

have
done

hurt
no

*NL*
``
Ah
,
senor
!

said
the
niece

your
worship
had
better
order
these

no
wonder

after
being

cured
of
his

my

by
reading
these

took
a
fancy
*NL*
to
turn
shepherd

range
the
woods

fields
singing

piping

,
*NL*
what
would
be
still
worse

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
damsel
is
right

the

it
will
be
well

begin
,
then
,
*NL*
with
the
`
Diana

of
Montemayor

I
am
of
opinion
it
should
not

that
it
should
be
cleared
of
all
that
about
the

of
almost
all

droll

the
sweetness

enchants

chants
them

it

rather

what

*NL*
``
The

nothing

perhaps
with
amendment

keep

shut
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

the

*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
was
tired
and
would
not
look
into
any
more
books

and
so
he
*NL*
decided
that

``
contents
uncertified

all
the

should
be
burned

*NL*
just
then
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
shed

myself

said
the

he
heard
the

title

``
had
I

CHAPTER
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
SECOND
SALLY
OF
OUR
WORTHY
KNIGHT
DON
QUIXOTE
OF
LA
MANCHA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
Don
Quixote
began
shouting
out
,
``
Here
,
here
,
valiant
*NL*
knights
!
here
is
need
for
you
to
put
forth
the
might
of
your
strong
arms
,
*NL*
for
they
of
the
Court
are
gaining
the
mastery
in
the
tourney
!
''
Called
*NL*
away
by
this
noise
and
outcry
,
they
proceeded
no
farther
with
the
*NL*
scrutiny
of
the
remaining
books
,
and
so
it
is
thought
that
``
The
Carolea
,
''
*NL*
``
The
Lion
of
Spain
,
''
and
``
The
Deeds
of
the
Emperor
,
''
written
by
Don
Luis
*NL*
de
Avila
,
went
to
the
fire
unseen
and
unheard
;
for
no
doubt
they
were
*NL*
among
those
that
remained
,
and
perhaps
if
the
curate
had
seen
them
they
*NL*
would
not
have
undergone
so
severe
a
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
Don
Quixote
he
was
already
out
of
bed
,
and
was
still
*NL*
shouting
and
raving
,
and
slashing
and
cutting
all
round
,
as
wide
awake
as
*NL*
if
he
had
never
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
closed
with
him
and
by
force
got
him
back
to
bed
,
and
when
he
had
*NL*
become
a
little
calm
,
addressing
the
curate
,
he
said
to
him
,
``
Of
a
truth
,
*NL*
Senor
Archbishop
Turpin
,
it
is
a
great
disgrace
for
us
who
call
ourselves
*NL*
the
Twelve
Peers
,
so
carelessly
to
allow
the
knights
of
the
Court
to
gain
*NL*
the
victory
in
this
tourney
,
we
the
adventurers
having
carried
off
the
*NL*
honour
on
the
three
former
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
gossip
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
please
God
,
the
luck
may
turn
,
and
what
*NL*
is
lost
to-day
may
be
won
to-morrow
;
for
the
present
let
your
worship
*NL*
have
a
care
of
your
health
,
for
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
*NL*
over-fatigued
,
if
not
badly
wounded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wounded
no
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
bruised
and
battered
no
doubt
,
for
*NL*
that
bastard
Don
Roland
has
cudgelled
me
with
the
trunk
of
an
oak
tree
,
*NL*
and
all
for
envy
,
because
he
sees
that
I
alone
rival
him
in
his
*NL*
achievements
.
But
I
should
not
call
myself
Reinaldos
of
Montalvan
did
he
*NL*
not
pay
me
for
it
in
spite
of
all
his
enchantments
as
soon
as
I
rise
from
*NL*
this
bed
.
For
the
present
let
them
bring
me
something
to
eat
,
for
that
,
I
*NL*
feel
,
is
what
will
be
more
to
my
purpose
,
and
leave
it
to
me
to
avenge
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
as
he
wished
;
they
gave
him
something
to
eat
,
and
once
more
he
*NL*
fell
asleep
,
leaving
them
marvelling
at
his
madness
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
the
housekeeper
burned
to
ashes
all
the
books
that
were
in
the
*NL*
yard
and
in
the
whole
house
;
and
some
must
have
been
consumed
that
*NL*
deserved
preservation
in
everlasting
archives
,
but
their
fate
and
the
*NL*
laziness
of
the
examiner
did
not
permit
it
,
and
so
in
them
was
verified
*NL*
the
proverb
that
the
innocent
suffer
for
the
guilty
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
remedies
which
the
curate
and
the
barber
immediately
applied
*NL*
to
their
friend
's
disorder
was
to
wall
up
and
plaster
the
room
where
the
*NL*
books
were
,
so
that
when
he
got
up
he
should
not
find
them
-LRB-
possibly
the
*NL*
cause
being
removed
the
effect
might
cease
-RRB-
,
and
they
might
say
that
a
*NL*
magician
had
carried
them
off
,
room
and
all
;
and
this
was
done
with
all
*NL*
despatch
.
Two
days
later
Don
Quixote
got
up
,
and
the
first
thing
he
did
*NL*
was
to
go
and
look
at
his
books
,
and
not
finding
the
room
where
he
had
*NL*
left
it
,
he
wandered
from
side
to
side
looking
for
it
.
He
came
to
the
*NL*
place
where
the
door
used
to
be
,
and
tried
it
with
his
hands
,
and
turned
*NL*
and
twisted
his
eyes
in
every
direction
without
saying
a
word
;
but
after
*NL*
a
good
while
he
asked
his
housekeeper
whereabouts
was
the
room
that
held
*NL*
his
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
housekeeper
,
who
had
been
already
well
instructed
in
what
she
was
to
*NL*
answer
,
said
,
``
What
room
or
what
nothing
is
it
that
your
worship
is
*NL*
looking
for
?
There
are
neither
room
nor
books
in
this
house
now
,
for
the
*NL*
devil
himself
has
carried
all
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
the
devil
,
''
said
the
niece
,
``
but
a
magician
who
came
on
a
*NL*
cloud
one
night
after
the
day
your
worship
left
this
,
and
dismounting
*NL*
from
a
serpent
that
he
rode
he
entered
the
room
,
and
what
he
did
there
I
*NL*
know
not
,
but
after
a
little
while
he
made
off
,
flying
through
the
roof
,
*NL*
and
left
the
house
full
of
smoke
;
and
when
we
went
to
see
what
he
had
*NL*
done
we
saw
neither
book
nor
room
:
but
we
remember
very
well
,
the
*NL*
housekeeper
and
I
,
that
on
leaving
,
the
old
villain
said
in
a
loud
voice
*NL*
that
,
for
a
private
grudge
he
owed
the
owner
of
the
books
and
the
room
,
*NL*
he
had
done
mischief
in
that
house
that
would
be
discovered
by-and-by
:
he
*NL*
said
too
that
his
name
was
the
Sage
Munaton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
have
said
Friston
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
he
called
himself
Friston
or
Friton
,
''
said
the
*NL*
housekeeper
,
``
I
only
know
that
his
name
ended
with
`
ton
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
does
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
he
is
a
sage
magician
,
a
great
enemy
*NL*
of
mine
,
who
has
a
spite
against
me
because
he
knows
by
his
arts
and
lore
*NL*
that
in
process
of
time
I
am
to
engage
in
single
combat
with
a
knight
*NL*
whom
he
befriends
and
that
I
am
to
conquer
,
and
he
will
be
unable
to
*NL*
prevent
it
;
and
for
this
reason
he
endeavours
to
do
me
all
the
ill
turns
*NL*
that
he
can
;
but
I
promise
him
it
will
be
hard
for
him
to
oppose
or
avoid
*NL*
what
is
decreed
by
Heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
doubts
that
?
''
said
the
niece
;
``
but
,
uncle
,
who
mixes
you
up
in
these
*NL*
quarrels

Would
it
not
be
better
to
remain
at
peace
in
your
own
house
*NL*
instead
of
roaming
the
world
looking
for
better
bread
than
ever
came
of
*NL*
wheat
,
never
reflecting
that
many
go
for
wool
and
come
back
shorn
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
niece
of
mine
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
how
much
astray
art
thou
in
*NL*
thy
reckoning
:
ere
they
shear
me
I
shall
have
plucked
away

stripped

off

touch
only
the

The
two
were
unwilling
to
make
any
further
answer
,
as
they
saw
that
his
*NL*
anger
was
kindling
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
then
,
he
remained
at
home
fifteen
days
very
quietly
without
*NL*
showing
any
signs
of
a
desire
to
take
up
with
his
former
delusions
,
and
*NL*
during
this
time
he
held
lively
discussions
with
his
two
gossips
,
the
*NL*
curate
and
the
barber
,
on
the
point
he
maintained
,
that
knights-errant
*NL*
were
what
the
world
stood
most
in
need
of
,
and
that
in
him
was
to
be
*NL*
accomplished
the
revival
of
knight-errantry
.
The
curate
sometimes
*NL*
contradicted
him
,
sometimes
agreed
with
him
,
for
if
he
had
not
observed
*NL*
this
precaution
he
would
have
been
unable
to
bring
him
to
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Don
Quixote
worked
upon
a
farm
labourer
,
a
neighbour
of
his
,
an
*NL*
honest
man
-LRB-
if
indeed
that
title
can
be
given
to
him
who
is
poor
-RRB-
,
but
*NL*
with
very
little
wit
in
his
pate
.
In
a
word
,
he
so
talked
him
over
,
and
*NL*
with
such
persuasions
and
promises
,
that
the
poor
clown
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
to
sally
forth
with
him
and
serve
him
as
esquire
.
Don
Quixote
,
among
*NL*
other
things
,
told
him
he
ought
to
be
ready
to
go
with
him
gladly
,
*NL*
because
any
moment
an
adventure
might
occur
that
might
win
an
island
in
*NL*
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
leave
him
governor
of
it
.
On
these
and
the
*NL*
like
promises
Sancho
Panza
-LRB-
for
so
the
labourer
was
called
-RRB-
left
wife
and
*NL*
children
,
and
engaged
himself
as
esquire
to
his
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
next
set
about
getting
some
money
;
and
selling
one
thing
and
*NL*
pawning
another
,
and
making
a
bad
bargain
in
every
case
,
he
got
together
*NL*
a
fair
sum
.
He
provided
himself
with
a
buckler
,
which
he
begged
as
a
loan
*NL*
from
a
friend
,
and
,
restoring
his
battered
helmet
as
best
he
could
,
he
*NL*
warned
his
squire
Sancho
of
the
day
and
hour
he
meant
to
set
out
,
that
he
*NL*
might
provide
himself
with
what
he
thought
most
needful
.
Above
all
,
he
*NL*
charged
him
to
take
alforjas
with
him
.
The
other
said
he
would
,
and
that
*NL*
he
meant
to
take
also
a
very
good
ass
he
had
,
as
he
was
not
much
given
to
*NL*
going
on
foot
.
About
the
ass
,
Don
Quixote
hesitated
a
little
,
trying
*NL*
whether
he
could
call
to
mind
any
knight-errant
taking
with
him
an
*NL*
esquire
mounted
on
ass-back
,
but
no
instance
occurred
to
his
memory
.
For
*NL*
all
that
,
however
,
he
determined
to
take
him
,
intending
to
furnish
him
*NL*
with
a
more
honourable
mount
when
a
chance
of
it
presented
itself
,
by
*NL*
appropriating
the
horse
of
the
first
discourteous
knight
he
encountered
.
*NL*
Himself
he
provided
with
shirts
and
such
other
things
as
he
could
,
*NL*
according
to
the
advice
the
host
had
given
him
;
all
which
being
done
,
*NL*
without
taking
leave
,
Sancho
Panza
of
his
wife
and
children
,
or
Don
*NL*
Quixote
of
his
housekeeper
and
niece
,
they
sallied
forth
unseen
by
*NL*
anybody
from
the
village
one
night
,
and
made
such
good
way
in
the
course
*NL*
of
it
that
by
daylight
they
held
themselves
safe
from
discovery
,
even
*NL*
should
search
be
made
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
rode
on
his
ass
like
a
patriarch
,
with
his
alforjas
and
bota
,
and
*NL*
longing
to
see
himself
soon
governor
of
the
island
his
master
had
*NL*
promised
him
.
Don
Quixote
decided
upon
taking
the
same
route
and
road
he
*NL*
had
taken
on
his
first
journey
,
that
over
the
Campo
de
Montiel
,
which
he
*NL*
travelled
with
less
discomfort
than
on
the
last
occasion
,
for
,
as
it
was
*NL*
early
morning
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
fell
on
them
obliquely
,
the
heat
*NL*
did
not
distress
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
said
Sancho
Panza
to
his
master
,
``
Your
worship
will
take
care
,
*NL*
Senor
Knight-errant
,
not
to
forget
about
the
island
you
have
promised
me
,
*NL*
for
be
it
ever
so
big
I
'll
be
equal
to
governing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
Thou
must
know
,
friend
Sancho
Panza
,
that
*NL*
it
was
a
practice
very
much
in
vogue
with
the
knights-errant
of
old
to
*NL*
make
their
squires
governors
of
the
islands
or
kingdoms
they
won
,
and
I
*NL*
am
determined
that
there
shall
be
no
failure
on
my
part
in
so
liberal
a
*NL*
custom
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
mean
to
improve
upon
it
,
for
they
sometimes
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
most
frequently
,
waited
until
their
squires
were
old
,
and
*NL*
then
when
they
had
had
enough
of
service
and
hard
days
and
worse
nights
,
*NL*
they
gave
them
some
title
or
other
,
of
count
,
or
at
the
most
marquis
,
of
*NL*
some
valley
or
province
more
or
less
;
but
if
thou
livest
and
I
live
,
it
*NL*
may
well
be
that
before
six
days
are
over
,
I
may
have
won
some
kingdom
*NL*
that
has
others
dependent
upon
it
,
which
will
be
just
the
thing
to
enable
*NL*
thee
to
be
crowned
king
of
one
of
them
.
Nor
needst
thou
count
this
*NL*
wonderful
,
for
things
and
chances
fall
to
the
lot
of
such
knights
in
ways
*NL*
so
unexampled
and
unexpected
that
I
might
easily
give
thee
even
more
than
*NL*
I
promise
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
Sancho
Panza
,
``
if
I
should
become
a
king
by
one
of
*NL*
those
miracles

even
Juana

my

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
who
doubts
it
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
it
,
''
replied
Sancho
Panza
,
``
because
for
my
part
I
am
persuaded
*NL*
that
though
God
should
shower
down
kingdoms
upon
earth
,
not
one
of
them
*NL*
would
fit
the
head
of
Mari
Gutierrez
.
Let
me
tell
you
,
senor
,
she
is
not
*NL*
worth
two
maravedis
for

will
fit
her
better

that
*NL*
only
with
God
's
help

*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it
to
God

Sancho

returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
he
will
give
her
*NL*
what
suits
her
best
;
but
do
not
undervalue
thyself
so
much

to
come
to
*NL*
be
content
with
anything
less

being
governor
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not

answered
Sancho

a

CHAPTER
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
GOOD
FORTUNE
WHICH
THE
VALIANT
DON
QUIXOTE
HAD
IN
THE
TERRIBLE
AND
*NL*
UNDREAMT-OF
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
WINDMILLS
,
WITH
OTHER
OCCURRENCES
WORTHY
TO
*NL*
BE
FITLY
RECORDED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
they
came
in
sight
of
thirty
forty
windmills
that
there
are
*NL*
on
plain
,
and
as
soon
as
Don
Quixote
saw
them
he
said
to
his
squire
,
*NL*
``
Fortune
is
arranging
matters
for
us
better
than
we
could
have
shaped
our
*NL*
desires
ourselves
,
for
look
there
,
friend
Sancho
Panza
,
where
thirty
or
*NL*
more
monstrous
giants
present
themselves
,
all
of
whom
I
mean
to
engage
in
*NL*
battle
and
slay
,
and
with
whose
spoils
we
shall
begin
to
make
our
*NL*
fortunes
;
for
this
is
righteous
warfare
,
and
it
is
God
's
good
service
to
*NL*
sweep
so
evil
a
breed
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
giants
?
''
said
Sancho
Panza
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
thou
seest
there
,
''
answered
his
master
,
``
with
the
long
arms
,
and
*NL*
some
have
them
nearly
two
leagues
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
your
worship
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
what
we
see
there
are
not
giants
but
*NL*
windmills
,
and
what
seem
to
be
their
arms
are
the
sails
that
turned
by
*NL*
the
wind
make
the
millstone
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
easy
to
see
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
thou
art
not
used
to
this
*NL*
business
of
adventures
;
those
are
giants
;
and
if
thou
art
afraid
,
away
*NL*
with
thee
out
of
this
and
betake
thyself
to
prayer
while
I
engage
them
in
*NL*
fierce
and
unequal
combat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
gave
the
spur
to
his
steed
Rocinante
,
heedless
of
the
cries
*NL*
his
squire
Sancho
sent
after
him
,
warning
him
that
most
certainly
they
*NL*
were
windmills
and
not
giants
he
was
going
to
attack
.
He
,
however
,
was
so
*NL*
positive
they
were
giants
that
he
neither
heard
the
cries
of
Sancho
,
nor
*NL*
perceived
,
near
as
he
was
,
what
they
were
,
but
made
at
them
shouting
,
*NL*
``
Fly
not
,
cowards
and
vile
beings
,
for
a
single
knight
attacks
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
slight
breeze
at
this
moment
sprang
up
,
and
the
great
sails
began
to
*NL*
move
,
seeing
which
Don
Quixote
exclaimed
,
``
Though
ye
flourish
more
arms
*NL*
than
the
giant
Briareus
,
ye
have
to
reckon
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
and
commending
himself
with
all
his
heart
to
his
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
,
imploring
her
to
support
him
in
such
a
peril
,
with
lance
in
*NL*
rest
and
covered
by
his
buckler
,
he
charged
at
Rocinante
's
fullest
gallop
*NL*
and
fell
upon
the
first
mill
that
stood
in
front
of
him
;
but
as
he
drove
*NL*
his
lance-point
into
the
sail
the
wind
whirled
it
round
with
such
force
*NL*
that
it
shivered
the
lance
to
pieces
,
sweeping
with
it
horse
and
rider
,
*NL*
who
went
rolling
over
on
the
plain
,
in
a
sorry
condition
.
Sancho
hastened
*NL*
to
his
assistance
as
fast
as
his
ass
could
go
,
and
when
he
came
up
found
*NL*
him
unable
to
move
,
with
such
a
shock
had
Rocinante
fallen
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
me
!
''
said
Sancho
,
``
did
I
not
tell
your
worship
to
mind
what
*NL*
you
were
about
,
for
they
were
only
windmills
?
and
no
one
could
have
made
*NL*
any
mistake
about
it
but
one
who
had
something
of
the
same
kind
in
his
*NL*
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
friend
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
fortunes
of
war
more
*NL*
than
any
other
are
liable
to
frequent
fluctuations
;
and
moreover
I
think
,
*NL*
and
it
is
the
truth
,
that
that
same
sage
Friston
who
carried
off
my
study
*NL*
and
books
,
has
turned
these
giants
into
mills
in
order
to
rob
me
of
the
*NL*
glory
of
vanquishing
them
,
such
is
the
enmity
he
bears
me
;
but
in
the
end
*NL*
his
wicked
arts
will
avail
but
little
against
my
good
sword
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
order
it
as
he
may
,
''
said
Sancho
Panza
,
and
helping
him
to
rise
got
*NL*
him
up
again
on
Rocinante
,
whose
shoulder
was
half
out
;
and
then
,
*NL*
discussing
the
late
adventure
,
they
followed
the
road
to
Puerto
Lapice
,
*NL*
for
there
,
said
Don
Quixote
,
they
could
not
fail
to
find
adventures
in
*NL*
abundance
and
variety
,
as
it
was
a
great
thoroughfare
.
For
all
that
,
he
*NL*
was
much
grieved
at
the
loss
of
his
lance
,
and
saying
so
to
his
squire
,
*NL*
he
added
,
``
I
remember
having
read
how
a
Spanish
knight
,
Diego
Perez
de
*NL*
Vargas
by
name
,
having
broken
his
sword
in
battle
,
tore
from
an
oak
a
*NL*
ponderous
bough
or
branch
,
and
with
it
did
such
things
that
day
,
and
*NL*
pounded
so
many
Moors
,
that
he
got
the
surname
of
Machuca
,
and
he
and
his
*NL*
descendants
from
that
day
forth
were
called
Vargas
y
Machuca
.
I
mention
*NL*
this
because
from
the
first
oak
I
see
I
mean
to
rend
such
another
branch
,
*NL*
large
and
stout
like
that
,
with
which
I
am
determined
and
resolved
to
do
*NL*
such
deeds
that
thou
mayest
deem
thyself
very
fortunate
in
being
found
*NL*
worthy
to
come
and
see
them
,
and
be
an
eyewitness
of
things
that
will
*NL*
with
difficulty
be
believed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
that
as
God
will
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
believe
it
all
as
your
worship
*NL*
says
it
;
but
straighten
yourself
a
little
,
for
you
seem
all
on
one
side
,
*NL*
may
be
from
the
shaking
of
the
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
truth
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
if
I
make
no
complaint
of
the
*NL*
pain
it
is
because
knights-errant
are
not
permitted
to
complain
of
any
*NL*
wound
,
even
though
their
bowels
be
coming
out
through
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
have
nothing
to
say
;
but
God
knows
I
would
*NL*
rather
your
worship
complained
when
anything
ailed
you
.
For
my
part
,
I
*NL*
confess
I
must
complain
however
small
the
ache
may
be
;
unless
this
rule
*NL*
about
not
complaining
extends
to
the
squires
of
knights-errant
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
could
not
help
laughing
at
his
squire
's
simplicity
,
and
he
*NL*
assured
him
he
might
complain
whenever
and
however
he
chose
,
just
as
he
*NL*
liked
,
for
,
so
far
,
he
had
never
read
of
anything
to
the
contrary
in
the
*NL*
order
of
knighthood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
bade
him
remember
it
was
dinner-time
,
to
which
his
master
answered
*NL*
that
he
wanted
nothing
himself
just
then
,
but
that
he
might
eat
when
he
*NL*
had
a
mind
.
With
this
permission
Sancho
settled
himself
as
comfortably
as
*NL*
he
could
on
his
beast
,
and
taking
out
of
the
alforjas
what
he
had
stowed
*NL*
away
in
them
,
he
jogged
along
behind
his
master
munching
deliberately
,
*NL*
and
from
time
to
time
taking
a
pull
at
the
bota
with
a
relish
that
the
*NL*
thirstiest
tapster
in
Malaga
might
have
envied
;
and
while
he
went
on
in
*NL*
this
way
,
gulping
down
draught
after
draught
,
he
never
gave
a
thought
to
*NL*
any
of
the
promises
his
master
had
made
him
,
nor
did
he
rate
it
as
*NL*
hardship
but
rather
as
recreation
going
in
quest
of
adventures
,
however
*NL*
dangerous
they
might
be
.
Finally
they
passed
the
night
among
some
trees
,
*NL*
from
one
of
which
Don
Quixote
plucked
a
dry
branch
to
serve
him
after
a
*NL*
fashion
as
a
lance
,
and
fixed
on
it
the
head
he
had
removed
from
the
*NL*
broken
one
.
All
that
night
Don
Quixote
lay
awake
thinking
of
his
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
,
in
order
to
conform
to
what
he
had
read
in
his
books
,
how
many
*NL*
a
night
in
the
forests
and
deserts
knights
used
to
lie
sleepless
*NL*
supported
by
the
memory
of
their
mistresses
.
Not
so
did
Sancho
Panza
*NL*
spend
it
,
for
having
his
stomach
full
of
something
stronger
than
chicory
*NL*
water
he
made
but
one
sleep
of
it
,
and
,
if
his
master
had
not
called
him
,
*NL*
neither
the
rays
of
the
sun
beating
on
his
face
nor
all
the
cheery
notes
*NL*
of
the
birds
welcoming
the
approach
of
day
would
have
had
power
to
waken
*NL*
him
.
On
getting
up
he
tried
the
bota
and
found
it
somewhat
less
full
than
*NL*
the
night
before
,
which
grieved
his
heart
because
they
did
not
seem
to
be
*NL*
on
the
way
to
remedy
the
deficiency
readily
.
Don
Quixote
did
not
care
to
*NL*
break
his
fast
,
for
,
as
has
been
already
said
,
he
confined
himself
to
*NL*
savoury
recollections
for
nourishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
returned
to
the
road
they
had
set
out
with
,
leading
to
Puerto
*NL*
Lapice
,
and
at
three
in
the
afternoon
they
came
in
sight
of
it
.
``
Here
,
*NL*
brother
Sancho
Panza
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
when
he
saw
it
,
``
we
may
plunge
*NL*
our
hands
up
to
the
elbows
in
what
they
call
adventures
;
but
observe
,
*NL*
even
shouldst
thou
see
me
in
the
greatest
danger
in
the
world
,
thou
must
*NL*
not
put
a
hand
to
thy
sword
in
my
defence
,
unless
indeed
thou
perceivest
*NL*
that
those
who
assail
me
are
rabble
or
base
folk
;
for
in
that
case
thou
*NL*
mayest
very
properly
aid
me
;
but
if
they
be
knights
it
is
on
no
account
*NL*
permitted
or
allowed
thee
by
the
laws
of
knighthood
to
help
me
until
thou
*NL*
hast
been
dubbed
a
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
certainly
,
senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
your
worship
shall
be
fully
*NL*
obeyed
in
this
matter
;
all
the
more
as
of
myself
I
am
peaceful
and
no
*NL*
friend
to
mixing
in
strife
and
quarrels
:
it
is
true
that
as
regards
the
*NL*
defence
of
my
own
person
I
shall
not
give
much
heed
to
those
laws
,
for
*NL*
laws
human
and
divine
allow
each
one
to
defend
himself
against
any
*NL*
assailant
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
grant
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
in
this
matter
of
aiding
me
*NL*
against
knights
thou
must
put
a
restraint
upon
thy
natural
impetuosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
so
,
I
promise
you
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
and
will
keep
this
*NL*
precept
as
carefully
as
Sunday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
thus
talking
there
appeared
on
the
road
two
friars
of
the
*NL*
order
of
St.
Benedict
,
mounted
on
two
dromedaries
,
for
not
less
tall
were
*NL*
the
two
mules
they
rode
on
.
They
wore
travelling
spectacles
and
carried
*NL*
sunshades
;
and
behind
them
came
a
coach
attended
by
four
or
five
persons
*NL*
on
horseback
and
two
muleteers
on
foot
.
In
the
coach
there
was
,
as
*NL*
afterwards
appeared
,
a
Biscay
lady
on
her
way
to
Seville
,
where
her
*NL*
husband
was
about
to
take
passage
for
the
Indies
with
an
appointment
of
*NL*
high
honour
.
The
friars
,
though
going
the
same
road
,
were
not
in
her
*NL*
company
;
but
the
moment
Don
Quixote
perceived
them
he
said
to
his
squire
,
*NL*
``
Either
I
am
mistaken
,
or
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
famous
adventure
*NL*
that
has
ever
been
seen
,
for
those
black
bodies
we
see
there
must
be
,
and
*NL*
doubtless
are
,
magicians
who
are
carrying
off
some
stolen
princess
in
*NL*
that
coach
,
and
with
all
my
might
I
must
undo
this
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
be
worse
than
the
windmills
,
''
said
Sancho
.
``
Look
,
senor
;
those
*NL*
are
friars
of
St.
Benedict
,
and
the
coach
plainly
belongs
to
some
*NL*
travellers
:
I
tell
you
to
mind
well
what
you
are
about
and
do
n't
let
the
*NL*
devil
mislead
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
thee
already
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
adventures
thou
knowest
little
.
What
I
say
is
the
truth
,
as
*NL*
thou
shalt
see
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
advanced
and
posted
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
road
along
*NL*
which
the
friars
were
coming
,
and
as
soon
as
he
thought
they
had
come
*NL*
near
enough
to
hear
what
he
said
,
he
cried
aloud
,
``
Devilish
and
unnatural
*NL*
beings
,
release
instantly
the
highborn
princesses
whom
you
are
carrying
*NL*
off
by
force
in
this
coach
,
else
prepare
to
meet
a
speedy
death
as
the
*NL*
just
punishment
of
your
evil
deeds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
friars
drew
rein
and
stood
wondering
at
the
appearance
of
Don
Quixote
*NL*
as
well
as
at
his
words
,
to
which
they
replied
,
``
Senor
Caballero
,
we
are
*NL*
not
devilish
or
unnatural
,
but
two
brothers
of
St.
Benedict
following
our
*NL*
road
,
nor
do
we
know
whether
or
not
there
are
any
captive
princesses
*NL*
coming
in
this
coach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
soft
words
with
me
,
for
I
know
you
,
lying
rabble
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
spurred
Rocinante
and
with
levelled
*NL*
lance
charged
the
first
friar
with
such
fury
and
determination
,
that
,
if
*NL*
the
friar
had
not
flung
himself
off
the
mule
,
he
would
have
brought
him
*NL*
to
the
ground
against
his
will
,
and
sore
wounded
,
if
not
killed
outright
.
*NL*
The
second
brother
,
seeing
how
his
comrade
was
treated
,
drove
his
heels
*NL*
into
his
castle
of
a
mule
and
made
off
across
the
country
faster
than
the
*NL*
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
,
when
he
saw
the
friar
on
the
ground
,
dismounting
briskly
*NL*
from
his
ass
,
rushed
towards
him
and
began
to
strip
off
his
gown
.
At
that
*NL*
instant
the
friars
muleteers
came
up
and
asked
what
he
was
stripping
him
*NL*
for
.
Sancho
answered
them
that
this
fell
to
him
lawfully
as
spoil
of
the
*NL*
battle
which
his
lord
Don
Quixote
had
won
.
The
muleteers
,
who
had
no
idea
*NL*
of
a
joke
and
did
not
understand
all
this
about
battles
and
spoils
,
*NL*
seeing
that
Don
Quixote
was
some
distance
off
talking
to
the
travellers
*NL*
in
the
coach
,
fell
upon
Sancho
,
knocked
him
down
,
and
leaving
hardly
a
*NL*
hair
in
his
beard
,
belaboured
him
with
kicks
and
left
him
stretched
*NL*
breathless
and
senseless
on
the
ground
;
and
without
any
more
delay
helped
*NL*
the
friar
to
mount
,
who
,
trembling
,
terrified
,
and
pale
,
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
found
himself
in
the
saddle
,
spurred
after
his
companion
,
who
was
*NL*
standing
at
a
distance
looking
on
,
watching
the
result
of
the
onslaught
;
*NL*
then
,
not
caring
to
wait
for
the
end
of
the
affair
just
begun
,
they
*NL*
pursued
their
journey
making
more
crosses
than
if
they
had
the
devil
*NL*
after
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
,
as
has
been
said
,
speaking
to
the
lady
in
the
coach
:
*NL*
``
Your
beauty
,
lady
mine
,
''
said
he
,
``
may
now
dispose
of
your
person
as
may
*NL*
be
most
in
accordance
with
your
pleasure
,
for
the
pride
of
your
ravishers
*NL*
lies
prostrate
on
the
ground
through
this
strong
arm
of
mine
;
and
lest
*NL*
you
should
be
pining
to
know
the
name
of
your
deliverer
,
know
that
I
am
*NL*
called
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
knight-errant
and
adventurer
,
and
*NL*
captive
to
the
peerless
and
beautiful
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
:
and
in
*NL*
return
for
the
service
you
have
received
of
me
I
ask
no
more
than
that
*NL*
you
should
return
to
El
Toboso
,
and
on
my
behalf
present
yourself
before
*NL*
that
lady
and
tell
her
what
I
have
done
to
set
you
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
squires
in
attendance
upon
the
coach
,
a
Biscayan
,
was
*NL*
listening
to
all
Don
Quixote
was
saying
,
and
,
perceiving
that
he
would
*NL*
not
allow
the
coach
to
go
on
,
but
was
saying
it
must
return
at
once
to
El
*NL*
Toboso
,
he
made
at
him
,
and
seizing
his
lance
addressed
him
in
bad
*NL*
Castilian
and
worse
Biscayan
after
his
fashion
,
``
Begone
,
caballero
,
and
*NL*
ill
go
with
thee
;
by
the
God
that
made
me
,
unless
thou
quittest
coach
,
*NL*
slayest
thee
as
art
here
a
Biscayan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
understood
him
quite
well
,
and
answered
him
very
quietly
,
``
If
*NL*
thou
wert
a
knight
,
as
thou
art
none
,
I
should
have
already
chastised
thy
*NL*
folly
and
rashness
,
miserable
creature
.
''
To
which
the
Biscayan
returned
,
*NL*
``
I
no
gentleman
!
--
I
swear
to
God
thou
liest
as
I
am
Christian
:
if
thou
*NL*
droppest
lance
and
drawest
sword
,
soon
shalt
thou
see
thou
art
carrying
*NL*
water
to
the
cat
:
Biscayan
on
land
,
hidalgo
at
sea
,
hidalgo
at
the
devil
,
*NL*
and
look
,
if
thou
sayest
otherwise
thou
liest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
``
You
will
see
presently
,
''
said
Agrajes
,
'
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
and
*NL*
throwing
his
lance
on
the
ground
he
drew
his
sword
,
braced
his
buckler
on
*NL*
his
arm
,
and
attacked
the
Biscayan
,
bent
upon
taking
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Biscayan
,
when
he
saw
him
coming
on
,
though
he
wished
to
dismount
*NL*
from
his
mule
,
in
which
,
being
one
of
those
sorry
ones
let
out
for
hire
,
*NL*
he
had
no
confidence
,
had
no
choice
but
to
draw
his
sword
;
it
was
lucky
*NL*
for
him
,
however
,
that
he
was
near
the
coach
,
from
which
he
was
able
to
*NL*
snatch
a
cushion
that
served
him
for
a
shield
;
and
they
went
at
one
*NL*
another
as
if
they
had
been
two
mortal
enemies
.
The
others
strove
to
make
*NL*
peace
between
them
,
but
could
not
,
for
the
Biscayan
declared
in
his
*NL*
disjointed
phrase
that
if
they
did
not
let
him
finish
his
battle
he
would
*NL*
kill
his
mistress
and
everyone
that
strove
to
prevent
him
.
The
lady
in
*NL*
the
coach
,
amazed
and
terrified
at
what
she
saw
,
ordered
the
coachman
to
*NL*
draw
aside
a
little
,
and
set
herself
to
watch
this
severe
struggle
,
in
*NL*
the
course
of
which
the
Biscayan
smote
Don
Quixote
a
mighty
stroke
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
over
the
top
of
his
buckler
,
which
,
given
to
one
without
armour
,
*NL*
would
have
cleft
him
to
the
waist
.
Don
Quixote
,
feeling
the
weight
of
*NL*
this
prodigious
blow
,
cried
aloud
,
saying
,
``
O
lady
of
my
soul
,
Dulcinea
,
*NL*
flower
of
beauty
,
come
to
the
aid
of
this
your
knight
,
who
,
in
fulfilling
*NL*
his
obligations
to
your
beauty
,
finds
himself
in
this
extreme
peril
.
''
To
*NL*
say
this
,
to
lift
his
sword
,
to
shelter
himself
well
behind
his
buckler
,
*NL*
and
to
assail
the
Biscayan
was
the
work
of
an
instant
,
determined
as
he
*NL*
was
to
venture
all
upon
a
single
blow
.
The
Biscayan
,
seeing
him
come
on
*NL*
in
this
way
,
was
convinced
of
his
courage
by
his
spirited
bearing
,
and
*NL*
resolved
to
follow
his
example
,
so
he
waited
for
him
keeping
well
under
*NL*
cover
of
his
cushion
,
being
unable
to
execute
any
sort
of
manoeuvre
with
*NL*
his
mule
,
which
,
dead
tired
and
never
meant
for
this
kind
of
game
,
could
*NL*
not
stir
a
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
,
then
,
as
aforesaid
,
came
Don
Quixote
against
the
wary
Biscayan
,
with
*NL*
uplifted
sword
and
a
firm
intention
of
splitting
him
in
half
,
while
on
*NL*
his
side
the
Biscayan
waited
for
him
sword
in
hand
,
and
under
the
*NL*
protection
of
his
cushion
;
and
all
present
stood
trembling
,
waiting
in
*NL*
suspense
the
result
of
blows
such
as
threatened
to
fall
,
and
the
lady
in
*NL*
the
coach
and
the
rest
of
her
following
were
making
a
thousand
vows
and
*NL*
offerings
to
all
the
images
and
shrines
of
Spain
,
that
God
might
deliver
*NL*
her
squire
and
all
of
them
from
this
great
peril
in
which
they
found
*NL*
themselves
.
But
it
spoils
all
,
that
at
this
point
and
crisis
the
author
*NL*
of
the
history
leaves
this
battle
impending
,
giving
as
excuse
that
he
*NL*
could
find
nothing
more
written
about
these
achievements
of
Don
Quixote
*NL*
than
what
has
been
already
set
forth
.
It
is
true
the
second
author
of
*NL*
this
work
was
unwilling
to
believe
that
a
history
so
curious
could
have
*NL*
been
allowed
to
fall
under
the
sentence
of
oblivion
,
or
that
the
wits
of
*NL*
La
Mancha
could
have
been
so
undiscerning
as
not
to
preserve
in
their
*NL*
archives
or
registries
some
documents
referring
to
this
famous
knight
;
*NL*
and
this
being
his
persuasion
,
he
did
not
despair
of
finding
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
this
pleasant
history
,
which
,
heaven
favouring
him
,
he
did
*NL*
find
in
a
way

CHAPTER
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
IS
CONCLUDED
AND
FINISHED
THE
TERRIFIC
BATTLE
BETWEEN
THE
*NL*
GALLANT
BISCAYAN
AND
THE
VALIANT
MANCHEGAN
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
First
Part
of
this
history
we
left
the
valiant
Biscayan
and
the
*NL*
renowned
Don
Quixote
with
drawn
swords
uplifted
,
ready
to
deliver
two
*NL*
such
furious
slashing
blows
that
if
they
had
fallen
full
and
fair
they
*NL*
would
at
least
have
split
and
cleft
them
asunder
from
top
to
toe
and
laid
*NL*
them
open
like
a
pomegranate
;
and
at
this
so
critical
point
the
*NL*
delightful
history
came
to
a
stop
and
stood
cut
short
without
any
*NL*
intimation
from
the
author
where
what
was
missing
was
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
distressed
me
greatly
,
because
the
pleasure
derived
from
having
read
*NL*
such
a
small
portion
turned
to
vexation
at
the
thought
of
the
poor
chance
*NL*
that
presented
itself
of
finding
the
large
part
that
,
so
it
seemed
to
me
,
*NL*
was
missing
of
such
an
interesting
tale
.
It
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
thing
*NL*
impossible
and
contrary
to
all
precedent
that
so
good
a
knight
should
*NL*
have
been
without
some
sage
to
undertake
the
task
of
writing
his
*NL*
marvellous
achievements
;
a
thing
that
was
never
wanting
to
any
of
those
*NL*
knights-errant
who
,
they
say
,
went
after
adventures
;
for
every
one
of
*NL*
them
had
one
or
two
sages
as
if
made
on
purpose
,
who
not
only
recorded
*NL*
their
deeds
but
described
their
most
trifling
thoughts
and
follies
,
*NL*
however
secret
they
might
be
;
and
such
a
good
knight
could
not
have
been
*NL*
so
unfortunate
as
not
to
have
what
Platir
and
others
like
him
had
in
*NL*
abundance
.
And
so
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
such
a
gallant
*NL*
tale
had
been
left
maimed
and
mutilated
,
and
I
laid
the
blame
on
Time
,
*NL*
the
devourer
and
destroyer
of
all
things
,
that
had
either
concealed
or
*NL*
consumed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
it
struck
me
that
,
inasmuch
as
among
his
books
there
*NL*
had
been
found
such
modern
ones
as
``
The
Enlightenment
of
Jealousy
''
and
*NL*
the
``
Nymphs
and
Shepherds
of
Henares
,
''
his
story
must
likewise
be
modern
,
*NL*
and
that
though
it
might
not
be
written
,
it
might
exist
in
the
memory
of
*NL*
the
people
of
his
village
and
of
those
in
the
neighbourhood
.
This
*NL*
reflection
kept
me
perplexed
and
longing
to
know
really
and
truly
the
*NL*
whole
life
and
wondrous
deeds
of
our
famous
Spaniard
,
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
light
and
mirror
of
Manchegan
chivalry
,
and
the
first
that
in
our
*NL*
age
and
in
these
so
evil
days
devoted
himself
to
the
labour
and
exercise
*NL*
of
the
arms
of
knight-errantry
,
righting
wrongs
,
succouring
widows
,
and
*NL*
protecting
damsels
of
that
sort
that
used
to
ride
about
,
whip
in
hand
,
on
*NL*
their
palfreys
,
with
all
their
virginity
about
them
,
from
mountain
to
*NL*
mountain
and
valley
to
valley
--
for
,
if
it
were
not
for
some
ruffian
,
or
*NL*
boor
with
a
hood
and
hatchet
,
or
monstrous
giant
,
that
forced
them
,
there
*NL*
were
in
days
of
yore
damsels
that
at
the
end
of
eighty
years
,
in
all
*NL*
which
time
they
had
never
slept
a
day
under
a
roof
,
went
to
their
graves
*NL*
as
much
maids
as
the
mothers
that
bore
them
.
I
say
,
then
,
that
in
these
*NL*
and
other
respects
our
gallant
Don
Quixote
is
worthy
of
everlasting
and
*NL*
notable
praise
,
nor
should
it
be
withheld
even
from
me
for
the
labour
and
*NL*
pains
spent
in
searching
for
the
conclusion
of
this
delightful
history
;
*NL*
though
I
know
well
that
if
Heaven
,
chance
and
good
fortune
had
not
helped
*NL*
me
,
the
world
would
have
remained
deprived
of
an
entertainment
and
*NL*
pleasure
that
for
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
may
well
occupy
him
who
shall
*NL*
read
it
attentively
.
The
discovery
of
it
occurred
in
this
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
as
I
was
in
the
Alcana
of
Toledo
,
a
boy
came
up
to
sell
some
*NL*
pamphlets
and
old
papers
to
a
silk
mercer
,
and
,
as
I
am
fond
of
reading
*NL*
even
the
very
scraps
of
paper
in
the
streets
,
led
by
this
natural
bent
of
*NL*
mine
I
took
up
one
of
the
pamphlets
the
boy
had
for
sale
,
and
saw
that
it
*NL*
was
in
characters
which
I
recognised
as
Arabic
,
and
as
I
was
unable
to
*NL*
read
them
though
I
could
recognise
them
,
I
looked
about
to
see
if
there
*NL*
were
any
Spanish-speaking
Morisco
at
hand
to
read
them
for
me
;
nor
was
*NL*
there
any
great
difficulty
in
finding
such
an
interpreter
,
for
even
had
I
*NL*
sought
one
for
an
older
and
better
language
I
should
have
found
him
.
In
*NL*
short
,
chance
provided
me
with
one
,
who
when
I
told
him
what
I
wanted
and
*NL*
put
the
book
into
his
hands
,
opened
it
in
the
middle
and
after
reading
a
*NL*
little
in
it
began
to
laugh
.
I
asked
him
what
he
was
laughing
at
,
and
he
*NL*
replied
that
it
was
at
something
the
book
had
written
in
the
margin
by
*NL*
way
of
a
note
.
I
bade
him
tell
it
to
me
;
and
he
still
laughing
said
,
``
In
*NL*
the
margin
,
as
I
told
you
,
this
is
written
:
`
This
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
so
*NL*
often
mentioned
in
this
history
,
had
,
they
say
,
the
best
hand
of
any
*NL*
woman
in
all
La
Mancha
for
salting
pigs
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
heard
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
named
,
I
was
struck
with
surprise
and
*NL*
amazement
,
for
it
occurred
to
me
at
once
that
these
pamphlets
contained
*NL*
the
history
of
Don
Quixote
.
With
this
idea
I
pressed
him
to
read
the
*NL*
beginning
,
and
doing
so
,
turning
the
Arabic
offhand
into
Castilian
,
he
*NL*
told
me
it
meant
,
``
History
of
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
written
by
Cide
*NL*
Hamete
Benengeli
,
an
Arab
historian
.
''
It
required
great
caution
to
hide
*NL*
the
joy
I
felt
when
the
title
of
the
book
reached
my
ears
,
and
snatching
*NL*
it
from
the
silk
mercer
,
I
bought
all
the
papers
and
pamphlets
from
the
*NL*
boy
for
half
a
real
;
and
if
he
had
had
his
wits
about
him
and
had
known
*NL*
how
eager
I
was
for
them
,
he
might
have
safely
calculated
on
making
more
*NL*
than
six
reals
by
the
bargain
.
I
withdrew
at
once
with
the
Morisco
into
*NL*
the
cloister
of
the
cathedral
,
and
begged
him
to
turn
all
these
pamphlets
*NL*
that
related
to
Don
Quixote
into
the
Castilian
tongue
,
without
omitting
*NL*
or
adding
anything
to
them
,
offering
him
whatever
payment
he
pleased
.
He
*NL*
was
satisfied
with
two
arrobas
of
raisins
and
two
bushels
of
wheat
,
and
*NL*
promised
to
translate
them
faithfully
and
with
all
despatch
;
but
to
make
*NL*
the
matter
easier
,
and
not
to
let
such
a
precious
find
out
of
my
hands
,
I
*NL*
took
him
to
my
house
,
where
in
little
more
than
a
month
and
a
half
he
*NL*
translated
the
whole
just
as
it
is
set
down
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
pamphlet
the
battle
between
Don
Quixote
and
the
Biscayan
was
*NL*
drawn
to
the
very
life
,
they
planted
in
the
same
attitude
as
the
history
*NL*
describes
,
their
swords
raised
,
and
the
one
protected
by
his
buckler
,
the
*NL*
other
by
his
cushion
,
and
the
Biscayan
's
mule
so
true
to
nature
that
it
*NL*
could
be
seen
to
be
a
hired
one
a
bowshot
off
.
The
Biscayan
had
an
*NL*
inscription
under
his
feet
which
said
,
``
Don
Sancho
de
Azpeitia
,
''
which
no
*NL*
doubt
must
have
been
his
name
;
and
at
the
feet
of
Rocinante
was
another
*NL*
that
said
,
``
Don
Quixote
.
''
Rocinante
was
marvellously
portrayed
,
so
long
*NL*
and
thin
,
so
lank
and
lean
,
with
so
much
backbone
and
so
far
gone
in
*NL*
consumption
,
that
he
showed
plainly
with
what
judgment
and
propriety
the
*NL*
name
of
Rocinante
had
been
bestowed
upon
him
.
Near
him
was
Sancho
Panza
*NL*
holding
the
halter
of
his
ass
,
at
whose
feet
was
another
label
that
said
,
*NL*
``
Sancho
Zancas
,
''
and
according
to
the
picture
,
he
must
have
had
a
big
*NL*
belly
,
a
short
body
,
and
long
shanks
,
for
which
reason
,
no
doubt
,
the
*NL*
names
of
Panza
and
Zancas
were
given
him
,
for
by
these
two
surnames
the
*NL*
history
several
times
calls
him
.
Some
other
trifling
particulars
might
be
*NL*
mentioned
,
but
they
are
all
of
slight
importance
and
have
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
the
true
relation
of
the
history
;
and
no
history
can
be
bad
so
long
*NL*
as
it
is
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
against
the
present
one
any
objection
be
raised
on
the
score
of
its
*NL*
truth
,
it
can
only
be
that
its
author
was
an
Arab
,
as
lying
is
a
very
*NL*
common
propensity
with
those
of
that
nation
;
though
,
as
they
are
such
*NL*
enemies
of
ours
,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
were
omissions
rather
than
*NL*
additions
made
in
the
course
of
it
.
And
this
is
my
own
opinion
;
for
,
*NL*
where
he
could
and
should
give
freedom
to
his
pen
in
praise
of
so
worthy
*NL*
a
knight
,
he
seems
to
me
deliberately
to
pass
it
over
in
silence
;
which
*NL*
is
ill
done
and
worse
contrived
,
for
it
is
the
business
and
duty
of
*NL*
historians
to
be
exact
,
truthful
,
and
wholly
free
from
passion
,
and
*NL*
neither
interest
nor
fear
,
hatred
nor
love
,
should
make
them
swerve
from
*NL*
the
path
of
truth
,
whose
mother
is
history
,
rival
of
time
,
storehouse
of
*NL*
deeds
,
witness
for
the
past
,
example
and
counsel
for
the
present
,
and
*NL*
warning
for
the
future
.
In
this
I
know
will
be
found
all
that
can
be
*NL*
desired
in
the
pleasantest
,
and
if
it
be
wanting
in
any
good
quality
,
I
*NL*
maintain
it
is
the
fault
of
its
hound
of
an
author
and
not
the
fault
of
*NL*
the
subject
.
To
be
brief
,
its
Second
Part
,
according
to
the
translation
,
*NL*
began
in
this
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
With
trenchant
swords
upraised
and
poised
on
high
,
it
seemed
as
though
*NL*
the
two
valiant
and
wrathful
combatants
stood
threatening
heaven
,
and
*NL*
earth
,
and
hell
,
with
such
resolution
and
determination
did
they
bear
*NL*
themselves
.
The
fiery
Biscayan
was
the
first
to
strike
a
blow
,
which
was
*NL*
delivered
with
such
force
and
fury
that
had
not
the
sword
turned
in
its
*NL*
course
,
that
single
stroke
would
have
sufficed
to
put
an
end
to
the
*NL*
bitter
struggle
and
to
all
the
adventures
of
our
knight
;
but
that
good
*NL*
fortune
which
reserved
him
for
greater
things
,
turned
aside
the
sword
of
*NL*
his
adversary
,
so
that
although
it
smote
him
upon
the
left
shoulder
,
it
*NL*
did
him
no
more
harm
than
to
strip
all
that
side
of
its
armour
,
carrying
*NL*
away
a
great
part
of
his
helmet
with
half
of
his
ear
,
all
which
with
*NL*
fearful
ruin
fell
to
the
ground
,
leaving
him
in
a
sorry
plight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
God
!
Who
is
there
that
could
properly
describe
the
rage
that
filled
*NL*
the
heart
of
our
Manchegan
when
he
saw
himself
dealt
with
in
this
*NL*
fashion
?
All
that
can
be
said
is
,
it
was
such
that
he
again
raised
*NL*
himself
in
his
stirrups
,
and
,
grasping
his
sword
more
firmly
with
both
*NL*
hands
,
he
came
down
on
the
Biscayan
with
such
fury
,
smiting
him
full
over
*NL*
the
cushion
and
over
the
head
,
that
--
even
so
good
a
shield
proving
*NL*
useless
--
as
if
a
mountain
had
fallen
on
him
,
he
began
to
bleed
from
nose
,
*NL*
mouth
,
and
ears
,
reeling
as
if
about
to
fall
backwards
from
his
mule
,
as
*NL*
no
doubt
he
would
have
done
had
he
not
flung
his
arms
about
its
neck
;
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
however
,
he
slipped
his
feet
out
of
the
stirrups
and
then
*NL*
unclasped
his
arms
,
and
the
mule
,
taking
fright
at
the
terrible
blow
,
*NL*
made
off
across
the
plain
,
and
with
a
few
plunges
flung
its
master
to
the
*NL*
ground
.
Don
Quixote
stood
looking
on
very
calmly
,
and
,
when
he
saw
him
*NL*
fall
,
leaped
from
his
horse
and
with
great
briskness
ran
to
him
,
and
,
*NL*
presenting
the
point
of
his
sword
to
his
eyes
,
bade
him
surrender
,
or
he
*NL*
would
cut
his
head
off
.
The
Biscayan
was
so
bewildered
that
he
was
unable
*NL*
to
answer
a
word
,
and
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
him
,
so
blind
was
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
had
not
the
ladies
in
the
coach
,
who
had
hitherto
been
watching
*NL*
the
combat
in
great
terror
,
hastened
to
where
he
stood
and
implored
him
*NL*
with
earnest
entreaties
to
grant
them
the
great
grace
and
favour
of
*NL*
sparing
their
squire
's
life
;
to
which
Don
Quixote
replied
with
much
*NL*
gravity
and
dignity
,
``
In
truth
,
fair
ladies
,
I
am
well
content
to
do
what
*NL*
ye
ask
of
me
;
but
it
must
be
on
one
condition
and
understanding
,
which
is
*NL*
that
this
knight
promise
me
to
go
to
the
village
of
El
Toboso
,
and
on
my
*NL*
behalf
present
himself
before
the
peerless
lady
Dulcinea
,
that
she
deal
*NL*
with
him
as
shall
be
most
pleasing
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
terrified
and
disconsolate
ladies
,
without
discussing
Don
Quixote
's
*NL*
demand
or
asking
who
Dulcinea
might
be
,
promised
that
their
squire
should
*NL*
do
all
that
had
been
commanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
on
the
faith
of
that
promise
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
shall
do
him
*NL*
no
further
harm
,
though
he
well
deserves

CHAPTER
X.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
PLEASANT
DISCOURSE
THAT
PASSED
BETWEEN
DON
QUIXOTE
AND
HIS
SQUIRE
*NL*
SANCHO
PANZA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
by
this
time
Sancho
had
risen
,
rather
the
worse
for
the
handling
of
*NL*
the
friars
'
muleteers
,
and
stood
watching
the
battle
of
his
master
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
and
praying
to
God
in
his
heart
that
it
might
be
his
will
to
*NL*
grant
him
the
victory
,
and
that
he
might
thereby
win
some
island
to
make
*NL*
him
governor
of
,
as
he
had
promised
.
Seeing
,
therefore
,
that
the
struggle
*NL*
was
now
over
,
and
that
his
master
was
returning
to
mount
Rocinante
,
he
*NL*
approached
to
hold
the
stirrup
for
him
,
and
,
before
he
could
mount
,
he
*NL*
went
on
his
knees
before
him
,
and
taking
his
hand
,
kissed
it
saying
,
``
May
*NL*
it
please
your
worship
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
to
give
me
the
government
of
*NL*
that
island
which
has
been
won
in
this
hard
fight
,
for
be
it
ever
so
big
*NL*
I
feel
myself
in
sufficient
force
to
be
able
to
govern
it
as
much
and
as
*NL*
well
as
anyone
in
the
world
who
has
ever
governed
islands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
Thou
must
take
notice
,
brother
Sancho
,
*NL*
that
this
adventure
and
those
like
it
are
not
adventures
of
islands
,
but
*NL*
of
cross-roads
,
in
which
nothing
is
got
except
a
broken
head
or
an
ear
*NL*
the
less
:
have
patience
,
for
adventures
will
present
themselves
from
*NL*
which
I
may
make
you
,
not
only
a
governor
,
but
something
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
gave
him
many
thanks
,
and
again
kissing
his
hand
and
the
skirt
of
*NL*
his
hauberk
,
helped
him
to
mount
Rocinante
,
and
mounting
his
ass
himself
,
*NL*
proceeded
to
follow
his
master
,
who
at
a
brisk
pace
,
without
taking
*NL*
leave
,
or
saying
anything
further
to
the
ladies
belonging
to
the
coach
,
*NL*
turned
into
a
wood
that
was
hard
by
.
Sancho
followed
him
at
his
ass
's
*NL*
best
trot
,
but
Rocinante
stepped
out
so
that
,
seeing
himself
left
behind
,
*NL*
he
was
forced
to
call
to
his
master
to
wait
for
him
.
Don
Quixote
did
so
,
*NL*
reining
in
Rocinante
until
his
weary
squire
came
up
,
who
on
reaching
him
*NL*
said
,
``
It
seems
to
me
,
senor
,
it
would
be
prudent
in
us
to
go
and
take
*NL*
refuge
in
some
church
,
for
,
seeing
how
mauled
he
with
whom
you
fought
has
*NL*
been
left
,
it
will
be
no
wonder
if
they
give
information
of
the
affair
to
*NL*
the
Holy
Brotherhood
and
arrest
us
,
and
,
faith
,
if
they
do
,
before
we
*NL*
come
out
of
gaol
we
shall
have
to
sweat
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
where
hast
thou
ever
seen
or
heard
that
a
*NL*
knight-errant
has
been
arraigned
before
a
court
of
justice
,
however
many
*NL*
homicides
he
may
have
committed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
omecils
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
nor
in
my
life
have
had
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
one
;
I
only
know
that
the
Holy
Brotherhood
looks
*NL*
after
those
who
fight
in
the
fields
,
and
in
that
other
matter
I
do
not
*NL*
meddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
thou
needst
have
no
uneasiness
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
*NL*
I
will
deliver
thee
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Chaldeans
,
much
more
out
of
*NL*
those
of
the
Brotherhood
.
But
tell
me
,
as
thou
livest
,
hast
thou
seen
a
*NL*
more
valiant
knight
than
I
in
all
the
known
world
;
hast
thou
read
in
*NL*
history
of
any
who
has
or
had
higher
mettle
in
attack
,
more
spirit
in
*NL*
maintaining
it
,
more
dexterity
in
wounding
or
skill
in
overthrowing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
truth
is
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
that
I
have
never
read
any
history
,
for
*NL*
I
can
neither
read
nor
write
,
but
what
I
will
venture
to
bet
is
that
a
*NL*
more
daring
master
than
your
worship
I
have
never
served
in
all
the
days
*NL*
of
my
life
,
and
God
grant
that
this
daring
be
not
paid
for
where
I
have
*NL*
said
;
what
I
beg
of
your
worship
is
to
dress
your
wound
,
for
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
blood
flows
from
that
ear
,
and
I
have
here
some
lint
and
a
little
*NL*
white
ointment
in
the
alforjas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
might
be
well
dispensed
with
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
I
had
*NL*
remembered
to
make
a
vial
of
the
balsam
of
Fierabras
,
for
time
and
*NL*
medicine
are
saved
by
one
single
drop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
vial
and
what
balsam
is
that
?
''
said
Sancho
Panza
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
balsam
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
receipt
of
which
I
have
in
*NL*
my
memory
,
with
which
one
need
have
no
fear
of
death
,
or
dread
dying
of
*NL*
any
wound
;
and
so
when
I
make
it
and
give
it
to
thee
thou
hast
nothing
to
*NL*
do
when
in
some
battle
thou
seest
they
have
cut
me
in
half
through
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
body
--
as
is
wont
to
happen
frequently
,
--
but
neatly
and
with
*NL*
great
nicety
,
ere
the
blood
congeal
,
to
place
that
portion
of
the
body
*NL*
which
shall
have
fallen
to
the
ground
upon
the
other
half
which
remains
*NL*
in
the
saddle
,
taking
care
to
fit
it
on
evenly
and
exactly
.
Then
thou
*NL*
shalt
give
me
to
drink
but
two
drops
of
the
balsam
I
have
mentioned
,
and
*NL*
thou
shalt
see
me
become
sounder
than
an
apple
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
be
so
,
''
said
Panza
,
``
I
renounce
henceforth
the
government
of
the
*NL*
promised
island
,
and
desire
nothing
more
in
payment
of
my
many
and
*NL*
faithful
services
than
that
your
worship
give
me
the
receipt
of
this
*NL*
supreme
liquor
,
for
I
am
persuaded
it
will
be
worth
more
than
two
reals
*NL*
an
ounce
anywhere
,
and
I
want
no
more
to
pass
the
rest
of
my
life
in
ease
*NL*
and
honour
;
but
it
remains
to
be
told
if
it
costs
much
to
make
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
less
than
three
reals
,
six
quarts
of
it
may
be
made
,
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sinner
that
I
am
!
''
said
Sancho
,
``
then
why
does
your
worship
put
off
*NL*
making
it
and
teaching
it
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
,
friend
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
``
greater
secrets
I
mean
to
teach
*NL*
thee
and
greater
favours
to
bestow
upon
thee
;
and
for
the
present
let
us
*NL*
see
to
the
dressing
,
for
my
ear
pains
me
more
than
I
could
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
took
out
some
lint
and
ointment
from
the
alforjas
;
but
when
Don
*NL*
Quixote
came
to
see
his
helmet
shattered
,
he
was
like
to
lose
his
senses
,
*NL*
and
clapping
his
hand
upon
his
sword
and
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
,
be
*NL*
said
,
``
I
swear
by
the
Creator
of
all
things
and
the
four
Gospels
in
their
*NL*
fullest
extent
,
to
do
as
the
great
Marquis
of
Mantua
did
when
he
swore
to
*NL*
avenge
the
death
of
his
nephew
Baldwin
-LRB-
and
that
was
not
to
eat
bread
*NL*
from
a
table-cloth
,
nor
embrace
his
wife
,
and
other
points
which
,
though
*NL*
I
can
not
now
call
them
to
mind
,
I
here
grant
as
expressed
-RRB-
until
I
take
*NL*
complete
vengeance
upon
him
who
has
committed
such
an
offence
against
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
,
Sancho
said
to
him
,
``
Your
worship
should
bear
in
mind
,
*NL*
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
that
if
the
knight
has
done
what
was
commanded
him
in
*NL*
going
to
present
himself
before
my
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
he
will
have
*NL*
done
all
that
he
was
bound
to
do
,
and
does
not
deserve
further
punishment
*NL*
unless
he
commits
some
new
offence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
said
well
and
hit
the
point
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
and
so
I
*NL*
recall
the
oath
in
so
far
as
relates
to
taking
fresh
vengeance
on
him
,
*NL*
but
I
make
and
confirm
it
anew
to
lead
the
life
I
have
said
until
such
*NL*
time
as
I
take
by
force
from
some
knight
another
helmet
such
as
this
and
*NL*
as
good
;
and
think
not
,
Sancho
,
that
I
am
raising
smoke
with
straw
in
*NL*
doing
so
,
for
I
have
one
to
imitate
in
the
matter
,
since
the
very
same
*NL*
thing
to
a
hair
happened
in
the
case
of
Mambrino
's
helmet
,
which
cost
*NL*
Sacripante
so
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
let
your
worship
send
all
such
oaths
to
the
*NL*
devil
,
for
they
are
very
pernicious
to
salvation
and
prejudicial
to
the
*NL*
conscience
;
just
tell
me
now
,
if
for
several
days
to
come
we
fall
in
with
*NL*
no
man
armed
with
a
helmet
,
what
are
we
to
do
?
Is
the
oath
to
be
observed
*NL*
in
spite
of
all
the
inconvenience
and
discomfort
it
will
be
to
sleep
in
*NL*
your
clothes
,
and
not
to
sleep
in
a
house
,
and
a
thousand
other
*NL*
mortifications
contained
in
the
oath
of
that
old
fool
the
Marquis
of
*NL*
Mantua
,
which
your
worship
is
now
wanting
to
revive
?
Let
your
worship
*NL*
observe
that
there
are
no
men
in
armour
travelling
on
any
of
these
roads
,
*NL*
nothing
but
carriers
and
carters
,
who
not
only
do
not
wear
helmets
,
but
*NL*
perhaps
never
heard
tell
of
them
all
their
lives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
wrong
there
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
we
shall
not
have
been
*NL*
above
two
hours
among
these
cross-roads
before
we
see
more
men
in
armour
*NL*
than
came
to
Albraca
to
win
the
fair
Angelica
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
so
be
it
then
,
and
God
grant
us
success
,
and
that
*NL*
the
time
for
winning
that
island
which
is
costing
me
so
dear
may
soon
*NL*
come
,
and
then
let
me
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
thee
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
not
to
give
*NL*
thyself
any
uneasiness
on
that
score
;
for
if
an
island
should
fail
,
there
*NL*
is
the
kingdom
of
Denmark
,
or
of
Sobradisa
,
which
will
fit
thee
as
a
ring
*NL*
fits
the
finger
,
and
all
the
more
that
,
being
on
terra
firma
,
thou
wilt
*NL*
all
the
better
enjoy
thyself
.
But
let
us
leave
that
to
its
own
time
;
see
*NL*
if
thou
hast
anything
for
us
to
eat
in
those
alforjas
,
because
we
must
*NL*
presently
go
in
quest
of
some
castle
where
we
may
lodge
to-night
and
make
*NL*
the
balsam
I
told
thee
of
,
for
I
swear
to
thee
by
God
,
this
ear
is
giving
*NL*
me
great
pain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
here
an
onion
and
a
little
cheese
and
a
few
scraps
of
bread
,
''
*NL*
said
Sancho
,
``
but
they
are
not
victuals
fit
for
a
valiant
knight
like
*NL*
your
worship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
little
thou
knowest
about
it
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
``
I
would
have
*NL*
thee
to
know
,
Sancho
,
that
it
is
the
glory
of
knights-errant
to
go
*NL*
without
eating
for
a
month
,
and
even
when
they
do
eat
,
that
it
should
be
*NL*
of
what
comes
first
to
hand
;
and
this
would
have
been
clear
to
thee
hadst
*NL*
thou
read
as
many
histories
as
I
have
,
for
,
though
they
are
very
many
,
*NL*
among
them
all
I
have
found
no
mention
made
of
knights-errant
eating
,
*NL*
unless
by
accident
or
at
some
sumptuous
banquets
prepared
for
them
,
and
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
time
they
passed
in
dalliance
.
And
though
it
is
plain
*NL*
they
could
not
do
without
eating
and
performing
all
the
other
natural
*NL*
functions
,
because
,
in
fact
,
they
were
men
like
ourselves
,
it
is
plain
*NL*
too
that
,
wandering
as
they
did
the
most
part
of
their
lives
through
*NL*
woods
and
wilds
and
without
a
cook
,
their
most
usual
fare
would
be
rustic
*NL*
viands
such
as
those
thou
now
offer
me
;
so
that
,
friend
Sancho
,
let
not
*NL*
that
distress
thee
which
pleases
me
,
and
do
not
seek
to
make
a
new
world
*NL*
or
pervert
knight-errantry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
your
worship
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
,
as
I
can
not
read
or
write
,
*NL*
as
I
said
just
now
,
I
neither
know
nor
comprehend
the
rules
of
the
*NL*
profession
of
chivalry
:
henceforward
I
will
stock
the
alforjas
with
every
*NL*
kind
of
dry
fruit
for
your
worship
,
as
you
are
a
knight
;
and
for
myself
,
*NL*
as
I
am
not
one
,
I
will
furnish
them
with
poultry
and
other
things
more
*NL*
substantial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
say
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
it
is
imperative
on
*NL*
knights-errant
not
to
eat
anything
else
but
the
fruits
thou
speakest
of
;
*NL*
only
that
their
more
usual
diet
must
be
those
,
and
certain
herbs
they
*NL*
found
in
the
fields
which
they
knew
and
I
know
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
thing
it
is
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
to
know
those
herbs
,
for
to
my
*NL*
thinking
it
will
be
needful
some
day
to
put
that
knowledge
into
*NL*
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
taking
out
what
he
said
he
had
brought
,
the
pair
made
their
*NL*
repast
peaceably
and
sociably
.
But
anxious
to
find
quarters
for
the
*NL*
night
,
they
with
all
despatch
made
an
end
of
their
poor
dry
fare
,
mounted
*NL*
at
once
,
and
made
haste
to
reach
some
habitation
before
night
set
in
;
but
*NL*
daylight
and
the
hope
of
succeeding
in
their
object
failed
them
close
by
*NL*
the
huts
of
some
goatherds
,
so
they
determined
to
pass
the
night
there
,
*NL*
and
it
was
as
much
to
Sancho
's
discontent
not
to
have
reached
a
house
,
as
*NL*
it
was
to
his
master
's
satisfaction
to
sleep
under
the
open
heaven
,
for
*NL*
he
fancied
that
each
time
this
happened
to
him
he
performed
an
act
of
*NL*
ownership
that
helped
to
prove
his
chivalry
.

CHAPTER
XI
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHAT
BEFELL
DON
QUIXOTE
WITH
CERTAIN
GOATHERDS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
cordially
welcomed
by
the
goatherds
,
and
Sancho
,
having
as
best
he
*NL*
could
put
up
Rocinante
and
the
ass
,
drew
towards
the
fragrance
that
came
*NL*
from
some
pieces
of
salted
goat
simmering
in
a
pot
on
the
fire
;
and
*NL*
though
he
would
have
liked
at
once
to
try
if
they
were
ready
to
be
*NL*
transferred
from
the
pot
to
the
stomach
,
he
refrained
from
doing
so
as
*NL*
the
goatherds
removed
them
from
the
fire
,
and
laying
sheepskins
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
quickly
spread
their
rude
table
,
and
with
signs
of
hearty
*NL*
good-will
invited
them
both
to
share
what
they
had
.
Round
the
skins
six
*NL*
of
the
men
belonging
to
the
fold
seated
themselves
,
having
first
with
*NL*
rough
politeness
pressed
Don
Quixote
to
take
a
seat
upon
a
trough
which
*NL*
they
placed
for
him
upside
down
.
Don
Quixote
seated
himself
,
and
Sancho
*NL*
remained
standing
to
serve
the
cup
,
which
was
made
of
horn
.
Seeing
him
*NL*
standing
,
his
master
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
thou
mayest
see
,
Sancho
,
the
good
that
knight-errantry
contains
in
*NL*
itself
,
and
how
those
who
fill
any
office
in
it
are
on
the
high
road
to
*NL*
be
speedily
honoured
and
esteemed
by
the
world
,
I
desire
that
thou
seat
*NL*
thyself
here
at
my
side
and
in
the
company
of
these
worthy
people
,
and
*NL*
that
thou
be
one
with
me
who
am
thy
master
and
natural
lord
,
and
that
*NL*
thou
eat
from
my
plate
and
drink
from
whatever
I
drink
from
;
for
the
same
*NL*
may
be
said
of
knight-errantry
as
of
love
,
that
it
levels
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
thanks
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
I
may
tell
your
worship
that
provided
I
*NL*
have
enough
to
eat
,
I
can
eat
it
as
well
,
or
better
,
standing
,
and
by
*NL*
myself
,
than
seated
alongside
of
an
emperor
.
And
indeed
,
if
the
truth
is
*NL*
to
be
told
,
what
I
eat
in
my
corner
without
form
or
fuss
has
much
more
*NL*
relish
for
me
,
even
though
it
be
bread
and
onions
,
than
the
turkeys
of
*NL*
those
other
tables
where
I
am
forced
to
chew
slowly
,
drink
little
,
wipe
*NL*
my
mouth
every
minute
,
and
can
not
sneeze
or
cough
if
I
want
or
do
other
*NL*
things
that
are
the
privileges
of
liberty
and
solitude
.
So
,
senor
,
as
for
*NL*
these
honours
which
your
worship
would
put
upon
me
as
a
servant
and
*NL*
follower
of
knight-errantry
,
exchange
them
for
other
things
which
may
be
*NL*
of
more
use
and
advantage
to
me
;
for
these
,
though
I
fully
acknowledge
*NL*
them
as
received
,
I
renounce
from
this
moment
to
the
end
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
thou
must
seat
thyself
,
because
him
*NL*
who
humbleth
himself
God
exalteth
;
''
and
seizing
him
by
the
arm
he
forced
*NL*
him
to
sit
down
beside
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
goatherds
did
not
understand
this
jargon
about
squires
and
*NL*
knights-errant
,
and
all
they
did
was
to
eat
in
silence
and
stare
at
their
*NL*
guests
,
who
with
great
elegance
and
appetite
were
stowing
away
pieces
as
*NL*
big
as
one
's
fist
.
The
course
of
meat
finished
,
they
spread
upon
the
*NL*
sheepskins
a
great
heap
of
parched
acorns
,
and
with
them
they
put
down
a
*NL*
half
cheese
harder
than
if
it
had
been
made
of
mortar
.
All
this
while
the
*NL*
horn
was
not
idle
,
for
it
went
round
so
constantly
,
now
full
,
now
empty
,
*NL*
like
the
bucket
of
a
water-wheel
,
that
it
soon
drained
one
of
the
two
*NL*
wine-skins
that
were
in
sight
.
When
Don
Quixote
had
quite
appeased
his
*NL*
appetite
he
took
up
a
handful
of
the
acorns
,
and
contemplating
them
*NL*
attentively
delivered
himself
somewhat
in
this
fashion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
the
age
,
happy
the
time
,
to
which
the
ancients
gave
the
name
of
*NL*
golden
,
not
because
in
that
fortunate
age
the
gold
so
coveted
in
this
our
*NL*
iron
one
was
gained
without
toil
,
but
because
they
that
lived
in
it
knew
*NL*
not
the
two
words
``
mine
''
and
``
thine
''
!
In
that
blessed
age
all
things
were
*NL*
in
common
;
to
win
the
daily
food
no
labour
was
required
of
any
save
to
*NL*
stretch
forth
his
hand
and
gather
it
from
the
sturdy
oaks
that
stood
*NL*
generously
inviting
him
with
their
sweet
ripe
fruit
.
The
clear
streams
*NL*
and
running
brooks
yielded
their
savoury
limpid
waters
in
noble
*NL*
abundance
.
The
busy
and
sagacious
bees
fixed
their
republic
in
the
clefts
*NL*
of
the
rocks
and
hollows
of
the
trees
,
offering
without
usance
the
*NL*
plenteous
produce
of
their
fragrant
toil
to
every
hand
.
The
mighty
cork
*NL*
trees
,
unenforced
save
of
their
own
courtesy
,
shed
the
broad
light
bark
*NL*
that
served
at
first
to
roof
the
houses
supported
by
rude
stakes
,
a
*NL*
protection
against
the
inclemency
of
heaven
alone
.
Then
all
was
peace
,
*NL*
all
friendship
,
all
concord
;
as
yet
the
dull
share
of
the
crooked
plough
*NL*
had
not
dared
to
rend
and
pierce
the
tender
bowels
of
our
first
mother
*NL*
that
without
compulsion
yielded
from
every
portion
of
her
broad
fertile
*NL*
bosom
all
that
could
satisfy
,
sustain
,
and
delight
the
children
that
then
*NL*
possessed
her
.
Then
was
it
that
the
innocent
and
fair
young
shepherdess
*NL*
roamed
from
vale
to
vale
and
hill
to
hill
,
with
flowing
locks
,
and
no
*NL*
more
garments
than
were
needful
modestly
to
cover
what
modesty
seeks
and
*NL*
ever
sought
to
hide
.
Nor
were
their
ornaments
like
those
in
use
to-day
,
*NL*
set
off
by
Tyrian
purple
,
and
silk
tortured
in
endless
fashions
,
but
the
*NL*
wreathed
leaves
of
the
green
dock
and
ivy
,
wherewith
they
went
as
bravely
*NL*
and
becomingly
decked
as
our
Court
dames
with
all
the
rare
and
*NL*
far-fetched
artifices
that
idle
curiosity
has
taught
them
.
Then
the
*NL*
love-thoughts
of
the
heart
clothed
themselves
simply
and
naturally
as
the
*NL*
heart
conceived
them
,
nor
sought
to
commend
themselves
by
forced
and
*NL*
rambling
verbiage
.
Fraud
,
deceit
,
or
malice
had
then
not
yet
mingled
with
*NL*
truth
and
sincerity
.
Justice
held
her
ground
,
undisturbed
and
unassailed
*NL*
by
the
efforts
of
favour
and
of
interest
,
that
now
so
much
impair
,
*NL*
pervert
,
and
beset
her
.
Arbitrary
law
had
not
yet
established
itself
in
*NL*
the
mind
of
the
judge
,
for
then
there
was
no
cause
to
judge
and
no
one
to
*NL*
be
judged
.
Maidens
and
modesty
,
as
I
have
said
,
wandered
at
will
alone
*NL*
and
unattended
,
without
fear
of
insult
from
lawlessness
or
libertine
*NL*
assault
,
and
if
they
were
undone
it
was
of
their
own
will
and
pleasure
.
*NL*
But
now
in
this
hateful
age
of
ours
not
one
is
safe
,
not
though
some
new
*NL*
labyrinth
like
that
of
Crete
conceal
and
surround
her
;
even
there
the
*NL*
pestilence
of
gallantry
will
make
its
way
to
them
through
chinks
or
on
*NL*
the
air
by
the
zeal
of
its
accursed
importunity
,
and
,
despite
of
all
*NL*
seclusion
,
lead
them
to
ruin
.
In
defence
of
these
,
as
time
advanced
and
*NL*
wickedness
increased
,
the
order
of
knights-errant
was
instituted
,
to
*NL*
defend
maidens
,
to
protect
widows
and
to
succour
the
orphans
and
the
*NL*
needy
.
To
this
order
I
belong
,
brother
goatherds
,
to
whom
I
return
thanks
*NL*
for
the
hospitality
and
kindly
welcome
ye
offer
me
and
my
squire
;
for
*NL*
though
by
natural
law
all
living
are
bound
to
show
favour
to
*NL*
knights-errant
,
yet
,
seeing
that
without
knowing
this
obligation
ye
have
*NL*
welcomed
and
feasted
me
,
it
is
right
that
with
all
the
good-will
in
my
*NL*
power
I
should
thank
you
for
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
long
harangue
-LRB-
which
might
very
well
have
been
spared
-RRB-
our
*NL*
knight
delivered
because
the
acorns
they
gave
him
reminded
him
of
the
*NL*
golden
age
;
and
the
whim
seized
him
to
address
all
this
unnecessary
*NL*
argument
to
the
goatherds
,
who
listened
to
him
gaping
in
amazement
*NL*
without
saying
a
word
in
reply
.
Sancho
likewise
held
his
peace
and
ate
*NL*
acorns
,
and
paid
repeated
visits
to
the
second
wine-skin
,
which
they
had
*NL*
hung
up
on
a
cork
tree
to
keep
the
wine
cool
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
longer
in
talking
than
the
supper
in
finishing
,
at
the
*NL*
end
of
which
one
of
the
goatherds
said
,
``
That
your
worship
,
senor
*NL*
knight-errant
,
may
say
with
more
truth
that
we
show
you
hospitality
with
*NL*
ready
good-will
,
we
will
give
you
amusement
and
pleasure
by
making
one
of
*NL*
our
comrades
sing
:
he
will
be
here
before
long
,
and
he
is
a
very
*NL*
intelligent
youth
and
deep
in
love
,
and
what
is
more
he
can
read
and
*NL*
write
and
play
on
the
rebeck
to
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goatherd
had
hardly
done
speaking
,
when
the
notes
of
the
rebeck
*NL*
reached
their
ears
;
and
shortly
after
,
the
player
came
up
,
a
very
*NL*
good-looking
young
man
of
about
two-and-twenty
.
His
comrades
asked
him
if
*NL*
he
had
supped
,
and
on
his
replying
that
he
had
,
he
who
had
already
made
*NL*
the
offer
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
Antonio
,
thou
mayest
as
well
do
us
the
pleasure
of
singing
*NL*
a
little
,
that
the
gentleman
,
our
guest
,
may
see
that
even
in
the
*NL*
mountains
and
woods
there
are
musicians
:
we
have
told
him
of
thy
*NL*
accomplishments
,
and
we
want
thee
to
show
them
and
prove
that
we
say
*NL*
true
;
so
,
as
thou
livest
,
pray
sit
down
and
sing
that
ballad
about
thy
*NL*
love
that
thy
uncle
the
prebendary
made
thee
,
and
that
was
so
much
liked
*NL*
in
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
and
without
waiting
for
more
*NL*
pressing
he
seated
himself
on
the
trunk
of
a
felled
oak
,
and
tuning
his
*NL*
rebeck
,
presently
began
to
sing
to
these
words
.

ANTONIO
'S
BALLAD
*NL*
*NL*
Thou
dost
love
me
well
,
Olalla
;
*NL*
Well
I
know
it
,
even
though
*NL*
Love
's
mute
tongues
,
thine
eyes
,
have
never
*NL*
By
their
glances
told
me
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
I
know
my
love
thou
knowest
,
*NL*
Therefore
thine
to
claim
I
dare
:
*NL*
Once
it
ceases
to
be
secret
,
*NL*
Love
need
never
feel
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
True
it
is
,
Olalla
,
sometimes
*NL*
Thou
hast
all
too
plainly
shown
*NL*
That
thy
heart
is
brass
in
hardness
,
*NL*
And
thy
snowy
bosom
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
for
all
that
,
in
thy
coyness
,
*NL*
And
thy
fickle
fits
between
,
*NL*
Hope
is
there
--
at

the
border
*NL*
Of
her
garment
may
be
seen

*NL*
*NL*
Lures
to
faith
are
they
,
those
glimpses
,

And
to
faith
in
thee
I
hold

Kindness
can
not
make
it
stronger
,

Coldness
can
not
make
it
cold

*NL*
*NL*
If
it
be
that
love
is
gentle
,
*NL*
In
thy
gentleness
I
see
*NL*
Something
holding
out
assurance
*NL*
To
the
hope
of
winning
thee
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
be
that
in
devotion
*NL*
Lies
a
power
hearts
to
move
,
*NL*
That
which
every
day
I
show
thee
,
*NL*
Helpful
to
my
suit
should
prove
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
a
time
thou
must
have
noticed

*NL*
If
to
notice
thou
dost
care

How
I
go
about
on
Monday
*NL*
Dressed
in
all
my
Sunday
wear

*NL*
*NL*
Love

Monday

all
I
care
is

Thou

see
me
in

*NL*
No

I
make
of
dances

strains
that
pleased
thee
so

Keeping
thee
awake
from
midnight

the
cocks
began
to
crow
;

Or
of
how
I
roundly
swore
it

That
there
's
none
so
fair
as
thou
;
*NL*
True
it
is
,
but
as
I
said
it

By
the
girls
I
'm
hated
now

*NL*
*NL*
For
Teresa
of
the
hillside

At
my
praise
of
thee
was
sore
;

Said
,
``

adore

all

trinkets

And
her
borrowed
braids

made-up
beauties

That
would
Love
himself
ensnare

*NL*
*NL*
'
T
was
a
lie
,

so
I
told
her
,
*NL*
And
her
cousin
at
the
word
*NL*
Gave
me
his
defiance
for
it
;

And
what
followed

hast
heard

Mine
is
no

Mine
no
passion

amours

As
they
call
it

what
I
offer

Is
an
honest
love

Put
thy

yoke

*NL*
Mine
will
follow
,
thou
wilt
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Else
--
and
once
for
all
I

renown

*NL*
If
I
ever
quit
the
mountains

*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
goatherd
brought
his
song
to
an
end
,
and
though
Don
Quixote
*NL*
entreated
him
to
sing
more
,
Sancho
had
no
mind
that
way
,
being
more
*NL*
inclined
for
sleep
than
for
listening
to
songs
;
so
said
he
to
his
master
,
*NL*
``
Your
worship
will
do
well
to
settle
at
once
where
you
mean
to
pass
the
*NL*
night
,
for
the
labour
these
good
men
are
at
all
day
does
not
allow
them
*NL*
to
spend
the
night
in
singing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
thee
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
I
perceive
clearly
*NL*
that
those
visits
to
the
wine-skin
demand
compensation
in
sleep
rather
*NL*
than
in
music
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
sweet
to
us
all
,
blessed
be
God
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
deny
it
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
settle
thyself
where
thou
*NL*
wilt
;
those
of
my
calling
are
more
becomingly
employed
in
watching
than
*NL*
in
sleeping
;
still
it
would
be
as
well
if
thou
wert
to
dress
this
ear
for
*NL*
me
again
,
for
it
is
giving
me
more
pain
than
it
need
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
did
as
he
bade
him
,
but
one
of
the
goatherds
,
seeing
the
wound
,
*NL*
told
him
not
to
be
uneasy
,
as
he
would
apply
a
remedy
with
which
it
would
*NL*
be
soon
healed
;
and
gathering
some
leaves
of
rosemary
,
of
which
there
was
*NL*
a
great
quantity
there
,
he
chewed
them
and
mixed
them
with
a
little
salt
,
*NL*
and
applying
them
to
the
ear
he
secured
them
firmly
with
a
bandage
,
*NL*
assuring
him
that
no
other
treatment
would
be
required
,
and
so
it
proved

CHAPTER
XII

*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
A
GOATHERD
RELATED
TO
THOSE
WITH
DON
QUIXOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
another
young
man
,
one
of
those
who
fetched
their
provisions
*NL*
from
the
village
,
came
up
and
said
,
``
Do
you
know
what
is
going
on
in
the
*NL*
village
,
comrades
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
we
know
it
?
''
replied
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
you
must
know
,
''
continued
the
young
man
,
``
this
morning
that
*NL*
famous
student-shepherd
called
Chrysostom
died
,
and
it
is
rumoured
that
*NL*
he
died
of
love
for
that
devil
of
a
village
girl
the
daughter
of
*NL*
Guillermo
the
Rich
,
she
that
wanders
about
the
wolds
here
in
the
dress
of
*NL*
a
shepherdess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
Marcela
?
''
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
I
mean
,
''
answered
the
goatherd
;
``
and
the
best
of
it
is
,
he
has
*NL*
directed
in
his
will
that
he
is
to
be
buried
in
the
fields
like
a
Moor
,
*NL*
and
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
where
the
Cork-tree
spring
is
,
because
,
as
*NL*
the
story
goes
-LRB-
and
they
say
he
himself
said
so
-RRB-
,
that
was
the
place
*NL*
where
he
first
saw
her
.
And
he
has
also
left
other
directions
which
the
*NL*
clergy
of
the
village
say
should
not
and
must
not
be
obeyed
because
they
*NL*
savour
of
paganism
.
To
all
which
his
great
friend
Ambrosio
the
student
,
*NL*
he
who
,
like
him
,
also
went
dressed
as
a
shepherd
,
replies
that
*NL*
everything
must
be
done
without
any
omission
according
to
the
directions
*NL*
left
by
Chrysostom
,
and
about
this
the
village
is
all
in
commotion
;
*NL*
however
,
report
says
that
,
after
all
,
what
Ambrosio
and
all
the
shepherds
*NL*
his
friends
desire
will
be
done
,
and
to-morrow
they
are
coming
to
bury
*NL*
him
with
great
ceremony
where
I
said
.
I
am
sure
it
will
be
something
*NL*
worth
seeing
;
at
least
I
will
not
fail
to
go
and
see
it
even
if
I
knew
I
*NL*
should
not
return
to
the
village
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
do
the
same
,
''
answered
the
goatherds
,
``
and
cast
lots
to
see
who
*NL*
must
stay
to
mind
the
goats
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
sayest
well
,
Pedro
,
''
said
one
,
``
though
there
will
be
no
need
of
*NL*
taking
that
trouble
,
for
I
will
stay
behind
for
all
;
and
do
n't
suppose
it
*NL*
is
virtue
or
want
of
curiosity
in
me
;
it
is
that
the
splinter
that
ran
*NL*
into
my
foot
the
other
day
will
not
let
me
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
we
thank
thee
,
''
answered
Pedro
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
asked
Pedro
to
tell
him
who
the
dead
man
was
and
who
the
*NL*
shepherdess
,
to
which
Pedro
replied
that
all
he
knew
was
that
the
dead
*NL*
man
was
a
wealthy
gentleman
belonging
to
a
village
in
those
mountains
,
*NL*
who
had
been
a
student
at
Salamanca
for
many
years
,
at
the
end
of
which
*NL*
he
returned
to
his
village
with
the
reputation
of
being
very
learned
and
*NL*
deeply
read
.
``
Above
all
,
they
said
,
he
was
learned
in
the
science
of
the
*NL*
stars
and
of
what
went
on
yonder
in
the
heavens
and
the
sun
and
the
moon
,
*NL*
for
he
told
us
of
the
cris
of
the
sun
and
moon
to
exact
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eclipse
it
is
called
,
friend
,
not
cris
,
the
darkening
of
those
two
*NL*
luminaries
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
but
Pedro
,
not
troubling
himself
with
*NL*
trifles
,
went
on
with
his
story
,
saying
,
``
Also
he
foretold
when
the
year
*NL*
was
going
to
be
one
of
abundance
or
estility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sterility
,
you
mean
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sterility
or
estility
,
''
answered
Pedro
,
``
it
is
all
the
same
in
the
end
.
*NL*
And
I
can
tell
you
that
by
this
his
father
and
friends
who
believed
him
*NL*
grew
very
rich
because
they
did
as
he
advised
them
,
bidding
them
`
sow
*NL*
barley
this
year
,
not
wheat
;
this
year
you
may
sow
pulse
and
not
barley
;
*NL*
the
next
there
will
be
a
full
oil
crop
,
and
the
three
following
not
a
*NL*
drop
will
be
got
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
science
is
called
astrology
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
it
is
called
,
''
replied
Pedro
,
``
but
I
know
that
he
*NL*
knew
all
this
and
more
besides
.
But
,
to
make
an
end
,
not
many
months
had
*NL*
passed
after
he
returned
from
Salamanca
,
when
one
day
he
appeared
dressed
*NL*
as
a
shepherd
with
his
crook
and
sheepskin
,
having
put
off
the
long
gown
*NL*
he
wore
as
a
scholar
;
and
at
the
same
time
his
great
friend
,
Ambrosio
by
*NL*
name
,
who
had
been
his
companion
in
his
studies
,
took
to
the
shepherd
's
*NL*
dress
with
him
.
I
forgot
to
say
that
Chrysostom
,
who
is
dead
,
was
a
great
*NL*
man
for
writing
verses
,
so
much
so
that
he
made
carols
for
Christmas
Eve
,
*NL*
and
plays
for
Corpus
Christi
,
which
the
young
men
of
our
village
acted
,
*NL*
and
all
said
they
were
excellent
.
When
the
villagers
saw
the
two
scholars
*NL*
so
unexpectedly
appearing
in
shepherd
's
dress
,
they
were
lost
in
wonder
,
*NL*
and
could
not
guess
what
had
led
them
to
make
so
extraordinary
a
change
.
*NL*
About
this
time
the
father
of
our
Chrysostom
died
,
and
he
was
left
heir
*NL*
to
a
large
amount
of
property
in
chattels
as
well
as
in
land
,
no
small
*NL*
number
of
cattle
and
sheep
,
and
a
large
sum
of
money
,
of
all
of
which
the
*NL*
young
man
was
left
dissolute
owner
,
and
indeed
he
was
deserving
of
it
*NL*
all
,
for
he
was
a
very
good
comrade
,
and
kind-hearted
,
and
a
friend
of
*NL*
worthy
folk
,
and
had
a
countenance
like
a
benediction
.
Presently
it
came
*NL*
to
be
known
that
he
had
changed
his
dress
with
no
other
object
than
to
*NL*
wander
about
these
wastes
after
that
shepherdess
Marcela
our
lad
*NL*
mentioned
a
while
ago
,
with
whom
the
deceased
Chrysostom
had
fallen
in
*NL*
love
.
And
I
must
tell
you
now
,
for
it
is
well
you
should
know
it
,
who
*NL*
this
girl
is
;
perhaps
,
and
even
without
any
perhaps
,
you
will
not
have
*NL*
heard
anything
like
it
all
the
days
of
your
life
,
though
you
should
live
*NL*
more
years
than
sarna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
Sarra
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
unable
to
endure
the
goatherd
's
confusion
*NL*
of
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sarna
lives
long
enough
,
''
answered
Pedro
;
``
and
if
,
senor
,
you
must
*NL*
go
finding
fault
with
words
at
every
step
,
we
shall
not
make
an
end
of
it
*NL*
this
twelvemonth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
,
as
there
is
such
a
*NL*
difference
between
sarna
and
Sarra
,
I
told
you
of
it
;
however
,
you
have
*NL*
answered
very
rightly
,
for
sarna
lives
longer
than
Sarra
:
so
continue
*NL*
your
story
,
and
I
will
not
object
any
more
to
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
then
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
said
the
goatherd
,
``
that
in
our
village
there
*NL*
was
a
farmer
even
richer
than
the
father
of
Chrysostom
,
who
was
named
*NL*
Guillermo
,
and
upon
whom
God
bestowed
,
over
and
above
great
wealth
,
a
*NL*
daughter
at
whose
birth
her
mother
died
,
the
most
respected
woman
there
*NL*
was
in
this
neighbourhood
;
I
fancy
I
can
see
her
now
with
that
*NL*
countenance
which
had
the
sun
on
one
side
and
the
moon
on
the
other
;
and
*NL*
moreover
active
,
and
kind
to
the
poor
,
for
which
I
trust
that
at
the
*NL*
present
moment
her
soul
is
in
bliss
with
God
in
the
other
world
.
Her
*NL*
husband
Guillermo
died
of
grief
at
the
death
of
so
good
a
wife
,
leaving
*NL*
his
daughter
Marcela
,
a
child
and
rich
,
to
the
care
of
an
uncle
of
hers
,
*NL*
a
priest
and
prebendary
in
our
village
.
The
girl
grew
up
with
such
beauty
*NL*
that
it
reminded
us
of
her
mother
's
,
which
was
very
great
,
and
yet
it
was
*NL*
thought
that
the
daughter
's
would
exceed
it
;
and
so
when
she
reached
the
*NL*
age
of
fourteen
to
fifteen
years
nobody
beheld
her
but
blessed
God
that
*NL*
had
made
her
so
beautiful
,
and
the
greater
number
were
in
love
with
her
*NL*
past
redemption
.
Her
uncle
kept
her
in
great
seclusion
and
retirement
,
*NL*
but
for
all
that
the
fame
of
her
great
beauty
spread
so
that
,
as
well
for
*NL*
it
as
for
her
great
wealth
,
her
uncle
was
asked
,
solicited
,
and
*NL*
importuned
,
to
give
her
in
marriage
not
only
by
those
of
our
town
but
of
*NL*
those
many
leagues
round
,
and
by
the
persons
of
highest
quality
in
them
.
*NL*
But
he
,
being
a
good
Christian
man
,
though
he
desired
to
give
her
in
*NL*
marriage
at
once
,
seeing
her
to
be
old
enough
,
was
unwilling
to
do
so
*NL*
without
her
consent
,
not
that
he
had
any
eye
to
the
gain
and
profit
which
*NL*
the
custody
of
the
girl
's
property
brought
him
while
he
put
off
her
*NL*
marriage
;
and
,
faith
,
this
was
said
in
praise
of
the
good
priest
in
more
*NL*
than
one
set
in
the
town
.
For
I
would
have
you
know
,
Sir
Errant
,
that
in
*NL*
these
little
villages
everything
is
talked
about
and
everything
is
carped
*NL*
at
,
and
rest
assured
,
as
I
am
,
that
the
priest
must
be
over
and
above
*NL*
good
who
forces
his
parishioners
to
speak
well
of
him
,
especially
in
*NL*
villages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
truth
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
go
on
,
for
the
story
is
very
*NL*
good
,
and
you
,
good
Pedro
,
tell
it
with
very
good
grace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
that
of
the
Lord
not
be
wanting
to
me
,
''
said
Pedro
;
``
that
is
the
one
*NL*
to
have
.
To
proceed
;
you
must
know
that
though
the
uncle
put
before
his
*NL*
niece
and
described
to
her
the
qualities
of
each
one
in
particular
of
the
*NL*
many
who
had
asked
her
in
marriage
,
begging
her
to
marry
and
make
a
*NL*
choice
according
to
her
own
taste
,
she
never
gave
any
other
answer
than
*NL*
that
she
had
no
desire
to
marry
just
yet
,
and
that
being
so
young
she
did
*NL*
not
think
herself
fit
to
bear
the
burden
of
matrimony
.
At
these
,
to
all
*NL*
appearance
,
reasonable
excuses
that
she
made
,
her
uncle
ceased
to
urge
*NL*
her
,
and
waited
till
she
was
somewhat
more
advanced
in
age
and
could
mate
*NL*
herself
to
her
own
liking
.
For
,
said
he
--
and
he
said
quite
right
--
parents
*NL*
are
not
to
settle
children
in
life
against
their
will
.
But
when
one
least
*NL*
looked
for
it
,
lo
and
behold
!
one
day
the
demure
Marcela
makes
her
*NL*
appearance
turned
shepherdess
;
and
,
in
spite
of
her
uncle
and
all
those
*NL*
of
the
town
that
strove
to
dissuade
her
,
took
to
going
a-field
with
the
*NL*
other
shepherd-lasses
of
the
village
,
and
tending
her
own
flock
.
And
so
,
*NL*
since
she
appeared
in
public
,
and
her
beauty
came
to
be
seen
openly
,
I
*NL*
could
not
well
tell
you
how
many
rich
youths
,
gentlemen
and
peasants
,
*NL*
have
adopted
the
costume
of
Chrysostom
,
and
go
about
these
fields
making
*NL*
love
to
her
.
One
of
these
,
as
has
been
already
said
,
was
our
deceased
*NL*
friend
,
of
whom
they
say
that
he
did
not
love
but
adore
her
.
But
you
must
*NL*
not
suppose
,
because
Marcela
chose
a
life
of
such
liberty
and
*NL*
independence
,
and
of
so
little
or
rather
no
retirement
,
that
she
has
*NL*
given
any
occasion
,
or
even
the
semblance
of
one
,
for
disparagement
of
*NL*
her
purity
and
modesty
;
on
the
contrary
,
such
and
so
great
is
the
*NL*
vigilance
with
which
she
watches
over
her
honour
,
that
of
all
those
that
*NL*
court
and
woo
her
not
one
has
boasted
,
or
can
with
truth
boast
,
that
she
*NL*
has
given
him
any
hope
however
small
of
obtaining
his
desire
.
For
*NL*
although
she
does
not
avoid
or
shun
the
society
and
conversation
of
the
*NL*
shepherds
,
and
treats
them
courteously
and
kindly
,
should
any
one
of
them
*NL*
come
to
declare
his
intention
to
her
,
though
it
be
one
as
proper
and
holy
*NL*
as
that
of
matrimony
,
she
flings
him
from
her
like
a
catapult
.
And
with
*NL*
this
kind
of
disposition
she
does
more
harm
in
this
country
than
if
the
*NL*
plague
had
got
into
it
,
for
her
affability
and
her
beauty
draw
on
the
*NL*
hearts
of
those
that
associate
with
her
to
love
her
and
to
court
her
,
but
*NL*
her
scorn
and
her
frankness
bring
them
to
the
brink
of
despair
;
and
so
*NL*
they
know
not
what
to
say
save
to
proclaim
her
aloud
cruel
and
*NL*
hard-hearted
,
and
other
names
of
the
same
sort
which
well
describe
the
*NL*
nature
of
her
character
;
and
if
you
should
remain
here
any
time
,
senor
,
*NL*
you
would
hear
these
hills
and
valleys
resounding
with
the
laments
of
the
*NL*
rejected
ones
who
pursue
her
.
Not
far
from
this
there
is
a
spot
where
*NL*
there
are
a
couple
of
dozen
of
tall
beeches
,
and
there
is
not
one
of
them
*NL*
but
has
carved
and
written
on
its
smooth
bark
the
name
of
Marcela
,
and
*NL*
above
some
a
crown
carved
on
the
same
tree
as
though
her
lover
would
say
*NL*
more
plainly
that
Marcela
wore
and
deserved
that
of
all
human
beauty
.
*NL*
Here
one
shepherd
is
sighing
,
there
another
is
lamenting
;
there
love
*NL*
songs
are
heard
,
here
despairing
elegies
.
One
will
pass
all
the
hours
of
*NL*
the
night
seated
at
the
foot
of
some
oak
or
rock
,
and
there
,
without
*NL*
having
closed
his
weeping
eyes
,
the
sun
finds
him
in
the
morning
bemused
*NL*
and
bereft
of
sense
;
and
another
without
relief
or
respite
to
his
sighs
,
*NL*
stretched
on
the
burning
sand
in
the
full
heat
of
the
sultry
summer
*NL*
noontide
,
makes
his
appeal
to
the
compassionate
heavens
,
and
over
one
and
*NL*
the
other
,
over
these
and
all
,
the
beautiful
Marcela
triumphs
free
and
*NL*
careless
.
And
all
of
us
that
know
her
are
waiting
to
see
what
her
pride
*NL*
will
come
to
,
and
who
is
to
be
the
happy
man
that
will
succeed
in
taming
*NL*
a
nature
so
formidable
and
gaining
possession
of
a
beauty
so
supreme
.
All
*NL*
that
I
have
told
you
being
such
well-established
truth
,
I
am
persuaded
*NL*
that
what
they
say
of
the
cause
of
Chrysostom
's
death
,
as
our
lad
told
*NL*
us
,
is
the
same
.
And
so
I
advise
you
,
senor
,
fail
not
to
be
present
*NL*
to-morrow
at
his
burial
,
which
will
be
well
worth
seeing
,
for
Chrysostom
*NL*
had
many
friends
,
and
it
is
not
half
a
league
from
this
place
to
where
he
*NL*
directed
he
should
be
buried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
make
a
point
of
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
I
thank
you
for
the
*NL*
pleasure
you
have
given
me
by
relating
so
interesting
a
tale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
goatherd
,
``
I
do
not
know
even
the
half
of
what
has
*NL*
happened
to
the
lovers
of
Marcela
,
but
perhaps
to-morrow
we
may
fall
in
*NL*
with
some
shepherd
on
the
road
who
can
tell
us
;
and
now
it
will
be
well
*NL*
for
you
to
go
and
sleep
under
cover
,
for
the
night
air
may
hurt
your
*NL*
wound
,
though
with
the
remedy
I
have
applied
to
you
there
is
no
fear
of
*NL*
an
untoward
result
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
,
who
was
wishing
the
goatherd
's
loquacity
at
the
devil
,
on
*NL*
his
part
begged
his
master
to
go
into
Pedro
's
hut
to
sleep
.
He
did
so
,
*NL*
and
passed
all
the
rest
of
the
night
in
thinking
of
his
lady
Dulcinea
,
in
*NL*
imitation
of
the
lovers
of
Marcela
.
Sancho
Panza
settled
himself
between
*NL*
Rocinante
and
his
ass
,
and
slept
,
not
like
a
lover
who
had
been
*NL*
discarded
,
but
like
a
man
who
had
been
soundly
kicked
.

CHAPTER
XIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
IS
ENDED
THE
STORY
OF
THE
SHEPHERDESS
MARCELA
,
WITH
OTHER
*NL*
INCIDENTS
*NL*
*NL*
Bit
hardly
had
day
begun
to
show
itself
through
the
balconies
of
the
*NL*
east
,
when
five
of
the
six
goatherds
came
to
rouse
Don
Quixote
and
tell
*NL*
him
that
if
he
was
still
of
a
mind
to
go
and
see
the
famous
burial
of
*NL*
Chrysostom
they
would
bear
him
company
.
Don
Quixote
,
who
desired
nothing
*NL*
better
,
rose
and
ordered
Sancho
to
saddle
and
pannel
at
once
,
which
he
*NL*
did
with
all
despatch
,
and
with
the
same
they
all
set
out
forthwith
.
They
*NL*
had
not
gone
a
quarter
of
a
league
when
at
the
meeting
of
two
paths
they
*NL*
saw
coming
towards
them
some
six
shepherds
dressed
in
black
sheepskins
*NL*
and
with
their
heads
crowned
with
garlands
of
cypress
and
bitter
*NL*
oleander
.
Each
of
them
carried
a
stout
holly
staff
in
his
hand
,
and
along
*NL*
with
them
there
came
two
men
of
quality
on
horseback
in
handsome
*NL*
travelling
dress
,
with
three
servants
on
foot
accompanying
them
.
*NL*
Courteous
salutations
were
exchanged
on
meeting
,
and
inquiring
one
of
the
*NL*
other
which
way
each
party
was
going
,
they
learned
that
all
were
bound
*NL*
for
the
scene
of
the
burial
,
so
they
went
on
all
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
those
on
horseback
addressing
his
companion
said
to
him
,
``
It
seems
*NL*
to
me
,
Senor
Vivaldo
,
that
we
may
reckon
as
well
spent
the
delay
we
shall
*NL*
incur
in
seeing
this
remarkable
funeral
,
for
remarkable
it
can
not
but
be
*NL*
judging
by
the
strange
things
these
shepherds
have
told
us
,
of
both
the
*NL*
dead
shepherd
and
homicide
shepherdess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
think
too
,
''
replied
Vivaldo
,
``
and
I
would
delay
not
to
say
a
day
,
*NL*
but
four
,
for
the
sake
of
seeing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
asked
them
what
it
was
they
had
heard
of
Marcela
and
*NL*
Chrysostom
.
The
traveller
answered
that
the
same
morning
they
had
met
*NL*
these
shepherds
,
and
seeing
them
dressed
in
this
mournful
fashion
they
*NL*
had
asked
them
the
reason
of
their
appearing
in
such
a
guise
;
which
one
*NL*
of
them
gave
,
describing
the
strange
behaviour
and
beauty
of
a
*NL*
shepherdess
called
Marcela
,
and
the
loves
of
many
who
courted
her
,
*NL*
together
with
the
death
of
that
Chrysostom
to
whose
burial
they
were
*NL*
going
.
In
short
,
he
repeated
all
that
Pedro
had
related
to
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
dropped
,
and
another
was
commenced
by
him
who
was
*NL*
called
Vivaldo
asking
Don
Quixote
what
was
the
reason
that
led
him
to
go
*NL*
armed
in
that
fashion
in
a
country
so
peaceful
.
To
which
Don
Quixote
*NL*
replied
,
``
The
pursuit
of
my
calling
does
not
allow
or
permit
me
to
go
in
*NL*
any
other
fashion
;
easy
life
,
enjoyment
,
and
repose
were
invented
for
*NL*
soft
courtiers
,
but
toil
,
unrest
,
and
arms
were
invented
and
made
for
*NL*
those
alone
whom
the
world
calls
knights-errant
,
of
whom
I
,
though
*NL*
unworthy
,
am
the
least
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
they
heard
this
all
set
him
down
as
mad
,
and
the
better
to
*NL*
settle
the
point
and
discover
what
kind
of
madness
his
was
,
Vivaldo
*NL*
proceeded
to
ask
him
what
knights-errant
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
not
your
worships
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
read
the
annals
and
*NL*
histories
of
England
,
in
which
are
recorded
the
famous
deeds
of
King
*NL*
Arthur
,
whom
we
in
our
popular
Castilian
invariably
call
King
Artus
,
with
*NL*
regard
to
whom
it
is
an
ancient
tradition
,
and
commonly
received
all
over
*NL*
that
kingdom
of
Great
Britain
,
that
this
king
did
not
die
,
but
was
*NL*
changed
by
magic
art
into
a
raven
,
and
that
in
process
of
time
he
is
to
*NL*
return
to
reign
and
recover
his
kingdom
and
sceptre
;
for
which
reason
it
*NL*
can
not
be
proved
that
from
that
time
to
this
any
Englishman
ever
killed
a
*NL*
raven
?
Well
,
then
,
in
the
time
of
this
good
king
that
famous
order
of
*NL*
chivalry
of
the
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
was
instituted
,
and
the
amour
*NL*
of
Don
Lancelot
of
the
Lake
with
the
Queen
Guinevere
occurred
,
precisely
*NL*
as
is
there
related
,
the
go-between
and
confidante
therein
being
the
*NL*
highly
honourable
dame
Quintanona
,
whence
came
that
ballad
so
well
known
*NL*
and
widely
spread
in
our
Spain
--
*NL*
*NL*
O
never
surely
was
there
knight
*NL*
So
served
by
hand
of
dame
,
*NL*
As
served
was
he
Sir
Lancelot
hight
*NL*
When
he
from
Britain
came
--
*NL*
*NL*
with
all
the
sweet
and
delectable
course
of
his
achievements
in
love
and
*NL*
war
.
Handed
down
from
that
time
,
then
,
this
order
of
chivalry
went
on
*NL*
extending
and
spreading
itself
over
many
and
various
parts
of
the
world
;
*NL*
and
in
it
,
famous
and
renowned
for
their
deeds
,
were
the
mighty
Amadis
of
*NL*
Gaul
with
all
his
sons
and
descendants
to
the
fifth
generation
,
and
the
*NL*
valiant
Felixmarte
of
Hircania
,
and
the
never
sufficiently
praised
*NL*
Tirante
el
Blanco
,
and
in
our
own
days
almost
we
have
seen
and
heard
and
*NL*
talked
with
the
invincible
knight
Don
Belianis
of
Greece
.
This
,
then
,
*NL*
sirs
,
is
to
be
a
knight-errant
,
and
what
I
have
spoken
of
is
the
order
of
*NL*
his
chivalry
,
of
which
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
I
,
though
a
sinner
,
have
*NL*
made
profession
,
and
what
the
aforesaid
knights
professed
that
same
do
I
*NL*
profess
,
and
so
I
go
through
these
solitudes
and
wilds
seeking
*NL*
adventures
,
resolved
in
soul
to
oppose
my
arm
and
person
to
the
most
*NL*
perilous
that
fortune
may
offer
me
in
aid
of
the
weak
and
needy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
these
words
of
his
the
travellers
were
able
to
satisfy
themselves
of
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
being
out
of
his
senses
and
of
the
form
of
madness
that
*NL*
overmastered
him
,
at
which
they
felt
the
same
astonishment
that
all
felt
*NL*
on
first
becoming
acquainted
with
it
;
and
Vivaldo
,
who
was
a
person
of
*NL*
great
shrewdness
and
of
a
lively
temperament
,
in
order
to
beguile
the
*NL*
short
journey
which
they
said
was
required
to
reach
the
mountain
,
the
*NL*
scene
of
the
burial
,
sought
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
going
on
with
*NL*
his
absurdities
.
So
he
said
to
him
,
``
It
seems
to
me
,
Senor
Knight-errant
,
*NL*
that
your
worship
has
made
choice
of
one
of
the
most
austere
professions
*NL*
in
the
world
,
and
I
imagine
even
that
of
the
Carthusian
monks
is
not
so
*NL*
austere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
austere
it
may
perhaps
be
,
''
replied
our
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
so
*NL*
necessary
for
the
world
I
am
very
much
inclined
to
doubt
.
For
,
if
the
*NL*
truth
is
to
be
told
,
the
soldier
who
executes
what
his
captain
orders
*NL*
does
no
less
than
the
captain
himself
who
gives
the
order
.
My
meaning
,
*NL*
is
,
that
churchmen
in
peace
and
quiet
pray
to
Heaven
for
the
welfare
of
*NL*
the
world
,
but
we
soldiers
and
knights
carry
into
effect
what
they
pray
*NL*
for
,
defending
it
with
the
might
of
our
arms
and
the
edge
of
our
swords
,
*NL*
not
under
shelter
but
in
the
open
air
,
a
target
for
the
intolerable
rays
*NL*
of
the
sun
in
summer
and
the
piercing
frosts
of
winter
.
Thus
are
we
God
's
*NL*
ministers
on
earth
and
the
arms
by
which
his
justice
is
done
therein
.
And
*NL*
as
the
business
of
war
and
all
that
relates
and
belongs
to
it
can
not
be
*NL*
conducted
without
exceeding
great
sweat
,
toil
,
and
exertion
,
it
follows
*NL*
that
those
who
make
it
their
profession
have
undoubtedly
more
labour
than
*NL*
those
who
in
tranquil
peace
and
quiet
are
engaged
in
praying
to
God
to
*NL*
help
the
weak
.
I
do
not
mean
to
say
,
nor
does
it
enter
into
my
thoughts
,
*NL*
that
the
knight-errant
's
calling
is
as
good
as
that
of
the
monk
in
his
*NL*
cell
;
I
would
merely
infer
from
what
I
endure
myself
that
it
is
beyond
a
*NL*
doubt
a
more
laborious
and
a
more
belaboured
one
,
a
hungrier
and
*NL*
thirstier
,
a
wretcheder
,
raggeder
,
and
lousier
;
for
there
is
no
reason
to
*NL*
doubt
that
the
knights-errant
of
yore
endured
much
hardship
in
the
course
*NL*
of
their
lives
.
And
if
some
of
them
by
the
might
of
their
arms
did
rise
*NL*
to
be
emperors
,
in
faith
it
cost
them
dear
in
the
matter
of
blood
and
*NL*
sweat
;
and
if
those
who
attained
to
that
rank
had
not
had
magicians
and
*NL*
sages
to
help
them
they
would
have
been
completely
baulked
in
their
*NL*
ambition
and
disappointed
in
their
hopes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
own
opinion
,
''
replied
the
traveller
;
``
but
one
thing
among
*NL*
many
others
seems
to
me
very
wrong
in
knights-errant
,
and
that
is
that
*NL*
when
they
find
themselves
about
to
engage
in
some
mighty
and
perilous
*NL*
adventure
in
which
there
is
manifest
danger
of
losing
their
lives
,
they
*NL*
never
at
the
moment
of
engaging
in
it
think
of
commending
themselves
to
*NL*
God
,
as
is
the
duty
of
every
good
Christian
in
like
peril
;
instead
of
*NL*
which
they
commend
themselves
to
their
ladies
with
as
much
devotion
as
if
*NL*
these
were
their
gods
,
a
thing
which
seems
to
me
to
savour
somewhat
of
*NL*
heathenism
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
can
not
be
on
any
account
omitted
,
and
*NL*
the
knight-errant
would
be
disgraced
who
acted
otherwise
:
for
it
is
usual
*NL*
and
customary
in
knight-errantry
that
the
knight-errant
,
who
on
engaging
*NL*
in
any
great
feat
of
arms
has
his
lady
before
him
,
should
turn
his
eyes
*NL*
towards
her
softly
and
lovingly
,
as
though
with
them
entreating
her
to
*NL*
favour
and
protect
him
in
the
hazardous
venture
he
is
about
to
undertake
,
*NL*
and
even
though
no
one
hear
him
,
he
is
bound
to
say
certain
words
between
*NL*
his
teeth
,
commending
himself
to
her
with
all
his
heart
,
and
of
this
we
*NL*
have
innumerable
instances
in
the
histories
.
Nor
is
it
to
be
supposed
*NL*
from
this
that
they
are
to
omit
commending
themselves
to
God
,
for
there
*NL*
will
be
time
and
opportunity
for
doing
so
while
they
are
engaged
in
their
*NL*
task
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
''
answered
the
traveller
,
``
I
feel
some
doubt
still
,
because
*NL*
often
I
have
read
how
words
will
arise
between
two
knights-errant
,
and
*NL*
from
one
thing
to
another
it
comes
about
that
their
anger
kindles
and
*NL*
they
wheel
their
horses
round
and
take
a
good
stretch
of
field
,
and
then
*NL*
without
any
more
ado
at
the
top
of
their
speed
they
come
to
the
charge
,
*NL*
and
in
mid-career
they
are
wont
to
commend
themselves
to
their
ladies
;
*NL*
and
what
commonly
comes
of
the
encounter
is
that
one
falls
over
the
*NL*
haunches
of
his
horse
pierced
through
and
through
by
his
antagonist
's
*NL*
lance
,
and
as
for
the
other
,
it
is
only
by
holding
on
to
the
mane
of
his
*NL*
horse
that
he
can
help
falling
to
the
ground
;
but
I
know
not
how
the
dead
*NL*
man
had
time
to
commend
himself
to
God
in
the
course
of
such
rapid
work
*NL*
as
this
;
it
would
have
been
better
if
those
words
which
he
spent
in
*NL*
commending
himself
to
his
lady
in
the
midst
of
his
career
had
been
*NL*
devoted
to
his
duty
and
obligation
as
a
Christian
.
Moreover
,
it
is
my
*NL*
belief
that
all
knights-errant
have
not
ladies
to
commend
themselves
to
,
*NL*
for
they
are
not
all
in
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
impossible
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
:
``
I
say
it
is
impossible
that
*NL*
there
could
be
a
knight-errant
without
a
lady
,
because
to
such
it
is
as
*NL*
natural
and
proper
to
be
in
love
as
to
the
heavens
to
have
stars
:
most
*NL*
certainly
no
history
has
been
seen
in
which
there
is
to
be
found
a
*NL*
knight-errant
without
an
amour
,
and
for
the
simple
reason
that
without
*NL*
one
he
would
be
held
no
legitimate
knight
but
a
bastard
,
and
one
who
had
*NL*
gained
entrance
into
the
stronghold
of
the
said
knighthood
,
not
by
the
*NL*
door
,
but
over
the
wall
like
a
thief
and
a
robber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
said
the
traveller
,
``
if
I
remember
rightly
,
I
think
I
*NL*
have
read
that
Don
Galaor
,
the
brother
of
the
valiant
Amadis
of
Gaul
,
*NL*
never
had
any
special
lady
to
whom
he
might
commend
himself
,
and
yet
he
*NL*
was
not
the
less
esteemed
,
and
was
a
very
stout
and
famous
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
our
Don
Quixote
made
answer
,
``
Sir
,
one
solitary
swallow
does
not
*NL*
make
summer
;
moreover
,
I
know
that
knight
was
in
secret
very
deeply
in
*NL*
love
;
besides
which
,
that
way
of
falling
in
love
with
all
that
took
his
*NL*
fancy
was
a
natural
propensity
which
he
could
not
control
.
But
,
in
short
,
*NL*
it
is
very
manifest
that
he
had
one
alone
whom
he
made
mistress
of
his
*NL*
will
,
to
whom
he
commended
himself
very
frequently
and
very
secretly
,
for
*NL*
he
prided
himself
on
being
a
reticent
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
if
it
be
essential
that
every
knight-errant
should
be
in
love
,
''
*NL*
said
the
traveller
,
``
it
may
be
fairly
supposed
that
your
worship
is
so
,
*NL*
as
you
are
of
the
order
;
and
if
you
do
not
pride
yourself
on
being
as
*NL*
reticent
as
Don
Galaor
,
I
entreat
you
as
earnestly
as
I
can
,
in
the
name
*NL*
of
all
this
company
and
in
my
own
,
to
inform
us
of
the
name

country
,
*NL*
rank
,
and
beauty
of
your
lady
,
for
she
will
esteem
herself
fortunate
if
*NL*
all
the
world
knows
that
she
is
loved
and
served
by
such
a
knight
as
your
*NL*
worship
seems
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Don
Quixote
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
said
,
``
I
can
not
say
positively
*NL*
whether
my
sweet
enemy
is
pleased

not
that

world
should
know

her

I
can
only
say
in
answer
to
what
has
been
so
courteously
asked
*NL*
of
me
,
that
her
name
is
Dulcinea
,
her
country
El
Toboso
,
a
village
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
her
rank
must
be
at
least
that
of
a
princess
,
since
she
is
my
*NL*
queen
and
lady
,
and
her
beauty
superhuman
,
since
all
the
impossible
and
*NL*
fanciful
attributes
of
beauty
which
the
poets
apply
to
their
ladies
are
*NL*
verified
in
her
;
for
her
hairs
are
gold
,
her
forehead
Elysian
fields

her
*NL*
eyebrows
rainbows

her
eyes
suns

what
modesty
conceals
from
sight
such
,
I
think

*NL*
imagine
,
as
rational
reflection
can
only
extol
,
not
compare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
should
like
to
know
her
lineage
,
race
,
and
ancestry
,
''
said
Vivaldo
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
She
is
not
of
the
ancient
Roman
Curtii
,
*NL*
Caii
,
or
Scipios
,
nor
of
the
modern
Colonnas
or
Orsini
,
nor
of
the
*NL*
Moncadas
or
Requesenes
of
Catalonia
,
nor
yet
of
the
Rebellas

Villanovas

Palafoxes

but
she
is
of
those
of
El

modern

may
furnish
a
source
of
gentle

for
the
most

illustrious

of
the
ages
that
are
to
come
,
and
this
let
none
*NL*
dispute
with
me
save
on
the
condition
that
Zerbino
placed
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
trophy
of
Orlando
's
arms
,
saying
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
These
let
none
move

dareth
not

Roland
prove

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Although
mine
is
of
the
Cachopins
of
Laredo
,
''
said
the
traveller
,
``
I
*NL*
will
not
venture
to
compare
it
with
that
of
El
Toboso
of
La
Mancha
,
*NL*
though
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
no
such
surname
has
until
now
ever
reached
my
*NL*
ears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
has
that
never
reached
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
party
went
along
listening
with
great
attention
to
the
*NL*
conversation
of
the
pair
,
and
even
the
very
goatherds
and
shepherds
*NL*
perceived
how
exceedingly
out
of
his
wits
our
Don
Quixote
was
.
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
alone
thought
that
what
his
master
said
was
the
truth
,
knowing
who
*NL*
he
was
and
having
known
him
from
his
birth
;
and
all
that
he
felt
any
*NL*
difficulty
in
believing
was
that
about
the
fair
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
*NL*
because
neither
any
such
name
nor
any
such
princess
had
ever
come
to
his
*NL*
knowledge
though
he
lived
so
close
to
El
Toboso
.
They
were
going
along
*NL*
conversing
in
this
way
,
when
they
saw
descending
a
gap
between
two
high
*NL*
mountains
some
twenty
shepherds
,
all
clad
in
sheepskins
of
black
wool
,
*NL*
and
crowned
with
garlands
which
,
as
afterwards
appeared
,
were
,
some
of
*NL*
them
of
yew
,
some
of
cypress
.
Six
of
the
number
were
carrying
a
bier
*NL*
covered
with
a
great
variety
of
flowers
and
branches
,
on
seeing
which
one
*NL*
of
the
goatherds
said
,
``
Those
who
come
there
are
the
bearers
of
*NL*
Chrysostom
's
body
,
and
the
foot
of
that
mountain
is
the
place
where
he
*NL*
ordered
them
to
bury
him
.
''
They
therefore
made
haste
to
reach
the
spot
,
*NL*
and
did
so
by
the
time
those
who
came
had
laid
the
bier
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
and
four
of
them
with
sharp
pickaxes
were
digging
a
grave
by
the
side
of
*NL*
a
hard
rock
.
They
greeted
each
other
courteously
,
and
then
Don
Quixote
*NL*
and
those
who
accompanied
him
turned
to
examine
the
bier
,
and
on
it
,
*NL*
covered
with
flowers
,
they
saw
a
dead
body
in
the
dress
of
a
shepherd
,
to
*NL*
all
appearance
of
one
thirty
years
of
age
,
and
showing
even
in
death
that
*NL*
in
life
he
had
been
of
comely
features
and
gallant
bearing
.
Around
him
on
*NL*
the
bier
itself
were
laid
some
books
,
and
several
papers
open
and
folded
;
*NL*
and
those
who
were
looking
on
as
well
as
those
who
were
opening
the
grave
*NL*
and
all
the
others
who
were
there
preserved
a
strange
silence
,
until
one
*NL*
of
those
who
had
borne
the
body
said
to
another
,
``
Observe
carefully
,
*NL*
Ambrosia
if
this
is
the
place
Chrysostom
spoke
of
,
since
you
are
anxious
*NL*
that
what
he
directed
in
his
will
should
be
so
strictly
complied
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
place
,
''
answered
Ambrosia
``
for
in
it
many
a
time
did
my
poor
*NL*
friend
tell
me
the
story
of
his
hard
fortune
.
Here
it
was
,
he
told
me
,
*NL*
that
he
saw
for
the
first
time
that
mortal
enemy
of
the
human
race
,
and
*NL*
here
,
too
,
for
the
first
time
he
declared
to
her
his
passion
,
as
*NL*
honourable
as
it
was
devoted
,
and
here
it
was
that
at
last
Marcela
ended
*NL*
by
scorning
and
rejecting
him
so
as
to
bring
the
tragedy
of
his
wretched
*NL*
life
to
a
close
;
here
,
in
memory
of
misfortunes
so
great
,
he
desired
to
*NL*
be
laid
in
the
bowels
of
eternal
oblivion
.
''
Then
turning
to
Don
Quixote
*NL*
and
the
travellers
he
went
on
to
say
,
``
That
body
,
sirs
,
on
which
you
are
*NL*
looking
with
compassionate
eyes
,
was
the
abode
of
a
soul
on
which
Heaven
*NL*
bestowed
a
vast
share
of
its
riches
.
That
is
the
body
of
Chrysostom
,
who
*NL*
was
unrivalled
in
wit
,
unequalled
in
courtesy
,
unapproached
in
gentle
*NL*
bearing
,
a
phoenix
in
friendship
,
generous
without
limit
,
grave
without
*NL*
arrogance
,
gay
without
vulgarity
,
and
,
in
short
,
first
in
all
that
*NL*
constitutes
goodness
and
second
to
none
in
all
that
makes
up
misfortune
.
*NL*
He
loved
deeply
,
he
was
hated
;
he
adored
,
he
was
scorned
;
he
wooed
a
wild
*NL*
beast
,
he
pleaded
with
marble
,
he
pursued
the
wind
,
he
cried
to
the
*NL*
wilderness
,
he
served
ingratitude
,
and
for
reward
was
made
the
prey
of
*NL*
death
in
the
mid-course
of
life
,
cut
short
by
a
shepherdess
whom
he
*NL*
sought
to
immortalise
in
the
memory
of
man
,
as
these
papers
which
you
see
*NL*
could
fully
prove
,
had
he
not
commanded
me
to
consign
them
to
the
fire
*NL*
after
having
consigned
his
body
to
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
deal
with
them
more
harshly
and
cruelly
than
their
owner
*NL*
himself
,
''
said
Vivaldo
,
``
for
it
is
neither
right
nor
proper
to
do
the
*NL*
will
of
one
who
enjoins
what
is
wholly
unreasonable
;
it
would
not
have
*NL*
been
reasonable
in
Augustus
Caesar
had
he
permitted
the
directions
left
*NL*
by
the
divine
Mantuan
in
his
will
to
be
carried
into
effect
.
So
that
,
*NL*
Senor
Ambrosia
while
you
consign
your
friend
's
body
to
the
earth
,
you
*NL*
should
not
consign
his
writings
to
oblivion
,
for
if
he
gave
the
order
in
*NL*
bitterness
of
heart
,
it
is
not
right
that
you
should
irrationally
obey
*NL*
it
.
On
the
contrary
,
by
granting
life
to
those
papers
,
let
the
cruelty
of
*NL*
Marcela
live
for
ever
,
to
serve
as
a
warning
in
ages
to
come
to
all
men
*NL*
to
shun
and
avoid
falling
into
like
danger
;
or
I
and
all
of
us
who
have
*NL*
come
here
know
already
the
story
of
this
your
love-stricken
and
*NL*
heart-broken
friend
,
and
we
know
,
too
,
your
friendship
,
and
the
cause
of
*NL*
his
death
,
and
the
directions
he
gave
at
the
close
of
his
life
;
from
*NL*
which
sad
story
may
be
gathered
how
great
was
the
cruelty
of
Marcela
,
the
*NL*
love
of
Chrysostom
,
and
the
loyalty
of
your
friendship
,
together
with
the
*NL*
end
awaiting
those
who
pursue
rashly
the
path
that
insane
passion
opens
*NL*
to
their
eyes
.
Last
night
we
learned
the
death
of
Chrysostom
and
that
he
*NL*
was
to
be
buried
here
,
and
out
of
curiosity
and
pity
we
left
our
direct
*NL*
road
and
resolved
to
come
and
see
with
our
eyes
that
which
when
heard
of
*NL*
had
so
moved
our
compassion
,
and
in
consideration
of
that
compassion
and
*NL*
our
desire
to
prove
it
if
we
might
by
condolence
,
we
beg
of
you
,
*NL*
excellent
Ambrosia
,
or
at
least
I
on
my
own
account
entreat
you
,
that
*NL*
instead
of
burning
those
papers
you
allow
me
to
carry
away
some
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
waiting
for
the
shepherd
's
answer
,
he
stretched
out
his
hand
*NL*
and
took
up
some
of
those
that
were
nearest
to
him
;
seeing
which
Ambrosio
*NL*
said
,
``
Out
of
courtesy
,
senor
,
I
will
grant
your
request
as
to
those
you
*NL*
have
taken
,
but
it
is
idle
to
expect
me
to
abstain
from
burning
the
*NL*
remainder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vivaldo
,
who
was
eager
to
see
what
the
papers
contained
,
opened
one
of
*NL*
them
at
once
,
and
saw
that
its
title
was
``
Lay
of
Despair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ambrosio
hearing
it
said
,
``
That
is
the
last
paper
the
unhappy
man
wrote
;
*NL*
and
that
you
may
see
,
senor
,
to
what
an
end
his
misfortunes
brought
him
,
*NL*
read
it
so
that
you
may
be
heard
,
for
you
will
have
time
enough
for
that
*NL*
while
we
are
waiting
for
the
grave
to
be
dug
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
so
very
willingly
,
''
said
Vivaldo
;
and
as
all
the
bystanders
*NL*
were
equally
eager
they
gathered
round
him
,
and
he
,
reading
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
,
found
that
it
ran
as

CHAPTER
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
ARE
INSERTED
THE
DESPAIRING
VERSES
OF
THE
DEAD
SHEPHERD
,
TOGETHER
*NL*
WITH
OTHER
INCIDENTS
NOT
LOOKED
FOR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
LAY
OF
CHRYSOSTOM
*NL*
*NL*
Since
thou
dost
in
thy
cruelty
desire
*NL*
The
ruthless
rigour
of
thy
tyranny
*NL*
From
tongue
to
tongue
,
from
land
to
land
proclaimed
,
*NL*
The
very
Hell
will
I
constrain
to
lend
*NL*
This
stricken
breast
of
mine
deep
notes
of
woe
*NL*
To
serve
my
need
of
fitting
utterance
.
*NL*
And
as
I
strive
to
body
forth
the
tale
*NL*
Of
all
I
suffer
,
all
that
thou
hast
done
,
*NL*
Forth
shall
the
dread
voice
roll
,
and
bear
along
*NL*
Shreds
from
my
vitals
torn
for
greater
pain
.
*NL*
Then
listen
,
not
to
dulcet
harmony
,
*NL*
But
to
a
discord
wrung
by
mad
despair
*NL*
Out
of
this
bosom
's
depths
of
bitterness
,
*NL*
To
ease
my
heart
and
plant
a
sting
in
thine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lion
's
roar
,
the
fierce
wolf
's
savage
howl
,
*NL*
The
horrid
hissing
of
the
scaly
snake
,
*NL*
The
awesome
cries
of
monsters
yet
unnamed
,
*NL*
The
crow
's
ill-boding
croak
,
the
hollow
moan
*NL*
Of
wild
winds
wrestling
with
the
restless
sea
,
*NL*
The
wrathful
bellow
of
the
vanquished
bull
,
*NL*
The
plaintive
sobbing
of
the
widowed
dove
,
*NL*
The
envied
owl
's
sad
note
,
the
wail
of
woe
*NL*
That
rises
from
the
dreary
choir
of
Hell
,
*NL*
Commingled
in
one
sound
,
confusing
sense
,
*NL*
Let
all
these
come
to
aid
my
soul
's
complaint
,
*NL*
For
pain
like
mine
demands
new
modes
of
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
echoes
of
that
discord
shall
be
heard
*NL*
Where
Father
Tagus
rolls
,
or
on
the
banks
*NL*
Of
olive-bordered
Betis
;
to
the
rocks
*NL*
Or
in
deep
caverns
shall
my
plaint
be
told
,
*NL*
And
by
a
lifeless
tongue
in
living
words
;
*NL*
Or
in
dark
valleys
or
on
lonely
shores
,
*NL*
Where
neither
foot
of
man
nor
sunbeam
falls
;
*NL*
Or
in
among
the
poison-breathing
swarms
*NL*
Of
monsters
nourished
by
the
sluggish
Nile
.
*NL*
For
,
though
it
be
to
solitudes
remote
*NL*
The
hoarse
vague
echoes
of
my
sorrows
sound
*NL*
Thy
matchless
cruelty
,
my
dismal
fate
*NL*
Shall
carry
them
to
all
the
spacious
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Disdain
hath
power
to
kill
,
and
patience
dies
*NL*
Slain
by
suspicion
,
be
it
false
or
true
;
*NL*
And
deadly
is
the
force
of
jealousy
;
*NL*
Long
absence
makes
of
life
a
dreary
void
;
*NL*
No
hope
of
happiness
can
give
repose
*NL*
To
him
that
ever
fears
to
be
forgot
;
*NL*
And
death
,
inevitable
,
waits
in
hall
.
*NL*
But
I
,
by
some
strange
miracle
,
live
on
*NL*
A
prey
to
absence
,
jealousy
,
disdain
;
*NL*
Racked
by
suspicion
as
by
certainty
;
*NL*
Forgotten
,
left
to
feed
my
flame
alone
.
*NL*
And
while
I
suffer
thus
,
there
comes
no
ray
*NL*
Of
hope
to
gladden
me
athwart
the
gloom
;
*NL*
Nor
do
I
look
for
it
in
my
despair
;
*NL*
But
rather
clinging
to
a
cureless
woe
,
*NL*
All
hope
do
I
abjure
for
evermore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Can
there
be
hope
where
fear
is
?
Were
it
well
,
*NL*
When
far
more
certain
are
the
grounds
of
fear
?
*NL*
Ought
I
to
shut
mine
eyes
to
jealousy
,
*NL*
If
through
a
thousand
heart-wounds
it
appears
?
*NL*
Who
would
not
give
free
access
to
distrust
,
*NL*
Seeing
disdain
unveiled
,
and
--
bitter
change
!
--
*NL*
All
his
suspicions
turned
to
certainties
,
*NL*
And
the
fair
truth
transformed
into
a
lie
?
*NL*
Oh
,
thou
fierce
tyrant
of
the
realms
of
love
,
*NL*
Oh
,
Jealousy
!
put
chains
upon
these
hands
,
*NL*
And
bind
me
with
thy
strongest
cord
,
Disdain
.
*NL*
But
,
woe
is
me
!
triumphant
over
all
,
*NL*
My
sufferings
drown
the
memory
of
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
die
,
and
since
there
is
no
hope
*NL*
Of
happiness
for
me
in
life
or
death
,
*NL*
Still
to
my
fantasy
I
'll
fondly
cling
.
*NL*
I
'll
say
that
he
is
wise
who
loveth
well
,
*NL*
And
that
the
soul
most
free
is
that
most
bound
*NL*
In
thraldom
to
the
ancient
tyrant
Love
.
*NL*
I
'll
say
that
she
who
is
mine
enemy
*NL*
In
that
fair
body
hath
as
fair
a
mind
,
*NL*
And
that
her
coldness
is
but
my
desert
,
*NL*
And
that
by
virtue
of
the
pain
he
sends
*NL*
Love
rules
his
kingdom
with
a
gentle
sway
.
*NL*
Thus
,
self-deluding
,
and
in
bondage
sore
,
*NL*
And
wearing
out
the
wretched
shred
of
life
*NL*
To
which
I
am
reduced
by
her
disdain
,
*NL*
I
'll
give
this
soul
and
body
to
the
winds
,
*NL*
All
hopeless
of
a
crown
of
bliss
in
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thou
whose
injustice
hath
supplied
the
cause
*NL*
That
makes
me
quit
the
weary
life
I
loathe
,
*NL*
As
by
this
wounded
bosom
thou
canst
see
*NL*
How
willingly
thy
victim
I
become
,
*NL*
Let
not
my
death
,
if
haply
worth
a
tear
,
*NL*
Cloud
the
clear
heaven
that
dwells
in
thy
bright
eyes
;
*NL*
I
would
not
have
thee
expiate
in
aught
*NL*
The
crime
of
having
made
my
heart
thy
prey
;
*NL*
But
rather
let
thy
laughter
gaily
ring
*NL*
And
prove
my
death
to
be
thy
festival
.
*NL*
Fool
that
I
am
to
bid
thee
!
well
I
know
*NL*
Thy
glory
gains
by
my
untimely
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
it
is
the
time
;
from
Hell
's
abyss
*NL*
Come
thirsting
Tantalus
,
come
Sisyphus
*NL*
Heaving
the
cruel
stone
,
come
Tityus
*NL*
With
vulture
,
and
with
wheel
Ixion
come
,
*NL*
And
come
the
sisters
of
the
ceaseless
toil
;
*NL*
And
all
into
this
breast
transfer
their
pains
,
*NL*
And
-LRB-
if
such
tribute
to
despair
be
due
-RRB-
*NL*
Chant
in
their
deepest
tones
a
doleful
dirge
*NL*
Over
a
corse
unworthy
of
a
shroud
.
*NL*
Let
the
three-headed
guardian
of
the
gate
,
*NL*
And
all
the
monstrous
progeny
of
hell
,
*NL*
The
doleful
concert
join
:
a
lover
dead
*NL*
Methinks
can
have
no
fitter
obsequies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lay
of
despair
,
grieve
not
when
thou
art
gone
*NL*
Forth
from
this
sorrowing
heart
:
my
misery
*NL*
Brings
fortune
to
the
cause
that
gave
thee
birth
;
*NL*
Then
banish
sadness
even
in
the
tomb

*NL*
The
``
Lay
of
Chrysostom
''
met
with
the
approbation
of
the
listeners
,
though
*NL*
the
reader
said
it
did
not
seem
to
him
to
agree
with
what
he
had
heard
of
*NL*
Marcela
's
reserve
and
propriety
,
for
Chrysostom
complained
in
it
of
*NL*
jealousy
,
suspicion
,
and
absence
,
all
to
the
prejudice
of
the
good
name
*NL*
and
fame
of
Marcela
;
to
which
Ambrosio
replied
as
one
who
knew
well
his
*NL*
friend
's
most
secret
thoughts
,
``
Senor
,
to
remove
that
doubt
I
should
tell
*NL*
you
that
when
the
unhappy
man
wrote
this
lay
he
was
away
from
Marcela
,
*NL*
from
whom
he
had
voluntarily
separated
himself
,
to
try
if
absence
would
*NL*
act
with
him
as
it
is
wont
;
and
as
everything
distresses
and
every
fear
*NL*
haunts
the
banished
lover
,
so
imaginary
jealousies
and
suspicions
,
*NL*
dreaded
as
if
they
were
true
,
tormented
Chrysostom
;
and
thus
the
truth
of
*NL*
what
report
declares
of
the
virtue
of
Marcela
remains
unshaken
,
and
with
*NL*
her
envy
itself
should
not
and
can
not
find
any
fault
save
that
of
being
*NL*
cruel
,
somewhat
haughty
,
and
very
scornful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Vivaldo
;
and
as
he
was
about
to
read
another
paper
*NL*
of
those
he
had
preserved
from
the
fire
,
he
was
stopped
by
a
marvellous
*NL*
vision
-LRB-
for
such
it
seemed
-RRB-
that
unexpectedly
presented
itself
to
their
*NL*
eyes
;
for
on
the
summit
of
the
rock
where
they
were
digging
the
grave
*NL*
there
appeared
the
shepherdess
Marcela
,
so
beautiful
that
her
beauty
*NL*
exceeded
its
reputation
.
Those
who
had
never
till
then
beheld
her
gazed
*NL*
upon
her
in
wonder
and
silence
,
and
those
who
were
accustomed
to
see
her
*NL*
were
not
less
amazed
than
those
who
had
never
seen
her
before
.
But
the
*NL*
instant
Ambrosio
saw
her
he
addressed
her
,
with
manifest
indignation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Art
thou
come
,
by
chance
,
cruel
basilisk
of
these
mountains
,
to
see
if
*NL*
in
thy
presence
blood
will
flow
from
the
wounds
of
this
wretched
being
*NL*
thy
cruelty
has
robbed
of
life
;
or
is
it
to
exult
over
the
cruel
work
of
*NL*
thy
humours
that
thou
art
come
;
or
like
another
pitiless
Nero
to
look
*NL*
down
from
that
height
upon
the
ruin
of
his
Rome
in
embers
;
or
in
thy
*NL*
arrogance
to
trample
on
this
ill-fated
corpse
,
as
the
ungrateful
daughter
*NL*
trampled
on
her
father
Tarquin
's
?
Tell
us
quickly
for
what
thou
art
come
,
*NL*
or
what
it
is
thou
wouldst
have
,
for
,
as
I
know
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
Chrysostom
never
failed
to
obey
thee
in
life
,
I
will
make
all
these
who
*NL*
call
themselves
his
friends
obey
thee
,
though
he
be
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
not
,
Ambrosia
for
any
of
the
purposes
thou
hast
named
,
''
replied
*NL*
Marcela
,
``
but
to
defend
myself
and
to
prove
how
unreasonable
are
all
*NL*
those
who
blame
me
for
their
sorrow
and
for
Chrysostom
's
death
;
and
*NL*
therefore
I
ask
all
of
you
that
are
here
to
give
me
your
attention
,
for
*NL*
will
not
take
much
time
or
many
words
to
bring
the
truth
home
to
persons
*NL*
of
sense
.
Heaven
has
made
me
,
so
you
say
,
beautiful
,
and
so
much
so
that
*NL*
in
spite
of
yourselves
my
beauty
leads
you
to
love
me
;
and
for
the
love
*NL*
you
show
me
you
say
,
and
even
urge
,
that
I
am
bound
to
love
you
.
By
that
*NL*
natural
understanding
which
God
has
given
me
I
know
that
everything
*NL*
beautiful
attracts
love
,
but
I
can
not
see
how
,
by
reason
of
being
loved
,
*NL*
that
which
is
loved
for
its
beauty
is
bound
to
love
that
which
loves
it
;
*NL*
besides
,
it
may
happen
that
the
lover
of
that
which
is
beautiful
may
be
*NL*
ugly
,
and
ugliness
being
detestable
,
it
is
very
absurd
to
say
,
``
I
love
*NL*
thee
because
thou
art
beautiful
,
thou
must
love
me
though
I
be
ugly
.
''
But
*NL*
supposing
the
beauty
equal
on
both
sides
,
it
does
not
follow
that
the
*NL*
inclinations
must
be
therefore
alike
,
for
it
is
not
every
beauty
that
*NL*
excites
love
,
some
but
pleasing
the
eye
without
winning
the
affection
;
*NL*
and
if
every
sort
of
beauty
excited
love
and
won
the
heart
,
the
will
*NL*
would
wander
vaguely
to
and
fro
unable
to
make
choice
of
any
;
for
as
*NL*
there
is
an
infinity
of
beautiful
objects
there
must
be
an
infinity
of
*NL*
inclinations
,
and
true
love
,
I
have
heard
it
said
,
is
indivisible
,
and
*NL*
must
be
voluntary
and
not
compelled
.
If
this
be
so
,
as
I
believe
it
to
*NL*
be
,
why
do
you
desire
me
to
bend
my
will
by
force
,
for
no
other
reason
*NL*
but
that
you
say
you
love
me
?
Nay
--
tell
me
--
had
Heaven
made
me
ugly
,
as
it
*NL*
has
made
me
beautiful
,
could
I
with
justice
complain
of
you
for
not
*NL*
loving
me
?
Moreover
,
you
must
remember
that
the
beauty
I
possess
was
no
*NL*
choice
of
mine
,
for
,
be
it
what
it
may
,
Heaven
of
its
bounty
gave
it
me
*NL*
without
my
asking
or
choosing
it
;
and
as
the
viper
,
though
it
kills
with
*NL*
it
,
does
not
deserve
to
be
blamed
for
the
poison
it
carries
,
as
it
is
a
*NL*
gift
of
nature
,
neither
do
I
deserve
reproach
for
being
beautiful
;
for
*NL*
beauty
in
a
modest
woman
is
like
fire
at
a
distance
or
a
sharp
sword
;
the
*NL*
one
does
not
burn
,
the
other
does
not
cut
,
those
who
do
not
come
too
*NL*
near
.
Honour
and
virtue
are
the
ornaments
of
the
mind
,
without
which
the
*NL*
body
,
though
it
be
so
,
has
no
right
to
pass
for
beautiful
;
but
if
modesty
*NL*
is
one
of
the
virtues
that
specially
lend
a
grace
and
charm
to
mind
and
*NL*
body
,
why
should
she
who
is
loved
for
her
beauty
part
with
it
to
gratify
*NL*
one
who
for
his
pleasure
alone
strives
with
all
his
might
and
energy
to
*NL*
rob
her
of
it
?
I
was
born
free
,
and
that
I
might
live
in
freedom
I
chose
*NL*
the
solitude
of
the
fields
;
in
the
trees
of
the
mountains
I
find
society
,
*NL*
the
clear
waters
of
the
brooks
are
my
mirrors
,
and
to
the
trees
and
*NL*
waters
I
make
known
my
thoughts
and
charms
.
I
am
a
fire
afar
off
,
a
sword
*NL*
laid
aside
.
Those
whom
I
have
inspired
with
love
by
letting
them
see
me
,
*NL*
I
have
by
words
undeceived
,
and
if
their
longings
live
on
hope
--
and
I
*NL*
have
given
none
to
Chrysostom
or
to
any
other
--
it
can
not
justly
be
said
*NL*
that
the
death
of
any
is
my
doing
,
for
it
was
rather
his
own
obstinacy
*NL*
than
my
cruelty
that
killed
him
;
and
if
it
be
made
a
charge
against
me
*NL*
that
his
wishes
were
honourable
,
and
that
therefore
I
was
bound
to
yield
*NL*
to
them
,
I
answer
that
when
on
this
very
spot
where
now
his
grave
is
made
*NL*
he
declared
to
me
his
purity
of
purpose
,
I
told
him
that
mine
was
to
live
*NL*
in
perpetual
solitude
,
and
that
the
earth
alone
should
enjoy
the
fruits
*NL*
of
my
retirement
and
the
spoils
of
my
beauty
;
and
if
,
after
this
open
*NL*
avowal
,
he
chose
to
persist
against
hope
and
steer
against
the
wind
,
what
*NL*
wonder
is
it
that
he
should
sink
in
the
depths
of
his
infatuation
?
If
I
*NL*
had
encouraged
him
,
I
should
be
false
;
if
I
had
gratified
him
,
I
should
*NL*
have
acted
against
my
own
better
resolution
and
purpose
.
He
was
*NL*
persistent
in
spite
of
warning
,
he
despaired
without
being
hated
.
Bethink
*NL*
you
now
if
it
be
reasonable
that
his
suffering
should
be
laid
to
my
*NL*
charge
.
Let
him
who
has
been
deceived
complain
,
let
him
give
way
to
*NL*
despair
whose
encouraged
hopes
have
proved
vain
,
let
him
flatter
himself
*NL*
whom
I
shall
entice
,
let
him
boast
whom
I
shall
receive
;
but
let
not
him
*NL*
call
me
cruel
or
homicide
to
whom
I
make
no
promise
,
upon
whom
I
practise
*NL*
no
deception
,
whom
I
neither
entice
nor
receive
.
It
has
not
been
so
far
*NL*
the
will
of
Heaven
that
I
should
love
by
fate
,
and
to
expect
me
to
love
*NL*
by
choice
is
idle
.
Let
this
general
declaration
serve
for
each
of
my
*NL*
suitors
on
his
own
account
,
and
let
it
be
understood
from
this
time
forth
*NL*
that
if
anyone
dies
for
me
it
is
not
of
jealousy
or
misery
he
dies
,
for
*NL*
she
who
loves
no
one
can
give
no
cause
for
jealousy
to
any
,
and
candour
*NL*
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
scorn
.
Let
him
who
calls
me
wild
beast
and
*NL*
basilisk
,
leave
me
alone
as
something
noxious
and
evil
;
let
him
who
calls
*NL*
me
ungrateful
,
withhold
his
service
;
who
calls
me
wayward
,
seek
not
my
*NL*
acquaintance
;
who
calls
me
cruel
,
pursue
me
not
;
for
this
wild
beast
,
*NL*
this
basilisk
,
this
ungrateful
,
cruel
,
wayward
being
has
no
kind
of
*NL*
desire
to
seek
,
serve
,
know
,
or
follow
them
.
If
Chrysostom
's
impatience
*NL*
and
violent
passion
killed
him
,
why
should
my
modest
behaviour
and
*NL*
circumspection
be
blamed
?
If
I
preserve
my
purity
in
the
society
of
the
*NL*
trees
,
why
should
he
who
would
have
me
preserve
it
among
men
,
seek
to
rob
*NL*
me
of
it
?
I
have
,
as
you
know
,
wealth
of
my
own
,
and
I
covet
not
that
of
*NL*
others
;
my
taste
is
for
freedom
,
and
I
have
no
relish
for
constraint
;
I
*NL*
neither
love
nor
hate
anyone
;
I
do
not
deceive
this
one
or
court
that
,
or
*NL*
trifle
with
one
or
play
with
another
.
The
modest
converse
of
the
shepherd
*NL*
girls
of
these
hamlets
and
the
care
of
my
goats
are
my
recreations
;
my
*NL*
desires
are
bounded
by
these
mountains
,
and
if
they
ever
wander
hence
it
*NL*
is
to
contemplate
the
beauty
of
the
heavens
,
steps
by
which
the
soul
*NL*
travels
to
its
primeval
abode
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
and
not
waiting
to
hear
a
reply
,
she
turned
and
passed
*NL*
into
the
thickest
part
of
a
wood
that
was
hard
by
,
leaving
all
who
were
*NL*
there
lost
in
admiration
as
much
of
her
good
sense
as
of
her
beauty
.
*NL*
Some
--
those
wounded
by
the
irresistible
shafts
launched
by
her
bright
*NL*
eyes
--
made
as
though
they
would
follow
her
,
heedless
of
the
frank
*NL*
declaration
they
had
heard
;
seeing
which
,
and
deeming
this
a
fitting
*NL*
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
his
chivalry
in
aid
of
distressed
damsels
,
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
laying
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
,
exclaimed
in
a
*NL*
loud
and
distinct
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
no
one
,
whatever
his
rank
or
condition
,
dare
to
follow
the
beautiful
*NL*
Marcela
,
under
pain
of
incurring
my
fierce
indignation
.
She
has
shown
by
*NL*
clear
and
satisfactory
arguments
that
little
or
no
fault
is
to
be
found
*NL*
with
her
for
the
death
of
Chrysostom
,
and
also
how
far
she
is
from
*NL*
yielding
to
the
wishes
of
any
of
her
lovers
,
for
which
reason
,
instead
of
*NL*
being
followed
and
persecuted
,
she
should
in
justice
be
honoured
and
*NL*
esteemed
by
all
the
good
people
of
the
world
,
for
she
shows
that
she
is
*NL*
the
only
woman
in
it
that
holds
to
such
a
virtuous
resolution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
because
of
the
threats
of
Don
Quixote
,
or
because
Ambrosio
*NL*
told
them
to
fulfil
their
duty
to
their
good
friend
,
none
of
the
*NL*
shepherds
moved
or
stirred
from
the
spot
until
,
having
finished
the
grave
*NL*
and
burned
Chrysostom
's
papers
,
they
laid
his
body
in
it
,
not
without
*NL*
many
tears
from
those
who
stood
by
.
They
closed
the
grave
with
a
heavy
*NL*
stone
until
a
slab
was
ready
which
Ambrosio
said
he
meant
to
have
*NL*
prepared
,
with
an
epitaph
which
was
to
be
to
this
effect
:
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
the
stone
before
your
eyes
*NL*
The
body
of
a
lover
lies
;
*NL*
In
life
he
was
a
shepherd
swain
,
*NL*
In
death
a
victim
to
disdain
.
*NL*
Ungrateful
,
cruel
,
coy
,
and
fair
,
*NL*
Was
she
that
drove
him
to
despair
,
*NL*
And
Love
hath
made
her
his
ally
*NL*
For
spreading
wide
his
tyranny
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
then
strewed
upon
the
grave
a
profusion
of
flowers
and
branches
,
and
*NL*
all
expressing
their
condolence
with
his
friend
ambrosio
,
took
their
*NL*
Vivaldo
and
his
companion
did
the
same
;
and
Don
Quixote
bade
farewell
to
*NL*
his
hosts
and
to
the
travellers
,
who
pressed
him
to
come
with
them
to
*NL*
Seville
,
as
being
such
a
convenient
place
for
finding
adventures
,
for
*NL*
they
presented
themselves
in
every
street
and
round
every
corner
oftener
*NL*
than
anywhere
else
.
Don
Quixote
thanked
them
for
their
advice
and
for
the
*NL*
disposition
they
showed
to
do
him
a
favour
,
and
said
that
for
the
present
*NL*
he
would
not
,
and
must
not
go
to
Seville
until
he
had
cleared
all
these
*NL*
mountains
of
highwaymen
and
robbers
,
of
whom
report
said
they
were
full
.
*NL*
Seeing
his
good
intention
,
the
travellers
were
unwilling
to
press
him
*NL*
further
,
and
once
more
bidding
him
farewell
,
they
left
him
and
pursued
*NL*
their
journey
,
in
the
course
of
which
they
did
not
fail
to
discuss
the
*NL*
story
of
Marcela
and
Chrysostom
as
well
as
the
madness
of
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
He
,
on
his
part
,
resolved
to
go
in
quest
of
the
shepherdess
Marcela
,
and
*NL*
make
offer
to
her
of
all
the
service
he
could
render
her
;
but
things
did
*NL*
not
fall
out
with
him
as
he
expected
,
according
to
what
is
related
in

CHAPTER
XV
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
IS
RELATED
THE
UNFORTUNATE
ADVENTURE
THAT
DON
QUIXOTE
FELL
IN
*NL*
WITH
WHEN
HE
FELL
OUT
WITH
CERTAIN
HEARTLESS
YANGUESANS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
sage
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
relates
that
as
soon
as
Don
Quixote
took
*NL*
leave
of
his
hosts
and
all
who
had
been
present
at
the
burial
of
*NL*
Chrysostom
,
he
and
his
squire
passed
into
the
same
wood
which
they
had
*NL*
seen
the
shepherdess
Marcela
enter
,
and
after
having
wandered
for
more
*NL*
than
two
hours
in
all
directions
in
search
of
her
without
finding
her
,
*NL*
they
came
to
a
halt
in
a
glade
covered
with
tender
grass
,
beside
which
*NL*
ran
a
pleasant
cool
stream
that
invited
and
compelled
them
to
pass
there
*NL*
the
hours
of
the
noontide
heat
,
which
by
this
time
was
beginning
to
come
*NL*
on
oppressively
.
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
dismounted
,
and
turning
Rocinante
*NL*
and
the
ass
loose
to
feed
on
the
grass
that
was
there
in
abundance
,
they
*NL*
ransacked
the
alforjas
,
and
without
any
ceremony
very
peacefully
and
*NL*
sociably
master
and
man
made
their
repast
on
what
they
found
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
hobble
Rocinante
,
feeling
sure
,
*NL*
from
what
he
knew
of
his
staidness
and
freedom
from
incontinence
,
that
*NL*
all
the
mares
in
the
Cordova
pastures
would
not
lead
him
into
an
*NL*
impropriety
.
Chance
,
however
,
and
the
devil
,
who
is
not
always
asleep
,
so
*NL*
ordained
it
that
feeding
in
this
valley
there
was
a
drove
of
Galician
*NL*
ponies
belonging
to
certain
Yanguesan
carriers
,
whose
way
it
is
to
take
*NL*
their
midday
rest
with
their
teams
in
places
and
spots
where
grass
and
*NL*
water
abound
;
and
that
where
Don
Quixote
chanced
to
be
suited
the
*NL*
Yanguesans
'
purpose
very
well
.
It
so
happened
,
then
,
that
Rocinante
took
*NL*
a
fancy
to
disport
himself
with
their
ladyships
the
ponies
,
and
*NL*
abandoning
his
usual
gait
and
demeanour
as
he
scented
them
,
he
,
without
*NL*
asking
leave
of
his
master
,
got
up
a
briskish
little
trot
and
hastened
to
*NL*
make
known
his
wishes
to
them
;
they
,
however
,
it
seemed
,
preferred
their
*NL*
pasture
to
him
,
and
received
him
with
their
heels
and
teeth
to
such
*NL*
effect
that
they
soon
broke
his
girths
and
left
him
naked
without
a
*NL*
saddle
to
cover
him
;
but
what
must
have
been
worse
to
him
was
that
the
*NL*
carriers
,
seeing
the
violence
he
was
offering
to
their
mares
,
came
*NL*
running
up
armed
with
stakes
,
and
so
belaboured
him
that
they
brought
him
*NL*
sorely
battered
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
,
who
had
witnessed
the
drubbing
of
*NL*
Rocinante
,
came
up
panting
,
and
said
Don
Quixote
to
Sancho
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
I
can
see
,
friend
Sancho
,
these
are
not
knights
but
base
folk
*NL*
of
low
birth
:
I
mention
it
because
thou
canst
lawfully
aid
me
in
taking
*NL*
due
vengeance
for
the
insult
offered
to
Rocinante
before
our
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
vengeance
can
we
take
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
if
they
are
*NL*
more
than
twenty
,
and
we
no
more
than
two
,
or
,
indeed
,
perhaps
not
more
*NL*
than
one
and
a
half
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
count
for
a
hundred
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
and
without
more
words
he
*NL*
drew
his
sword
and
attacked
the
Yanguesans
and
excited
and
impelled
by
*NL*
the
example
of
his
master
,
Sancho
did
the
same
;
and
to
begin
with
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
delivered
a
slash
at
one
of
them
that
laid
open
the
leather
*NL*
jerkin
he
wore
,
together
with
a
great
portion
of
his
shoulder
.
The
*NL*
Yanguesans
,
seeing
themselves
assaulted
by
only
two
men
while
they
were
*NL*
so
many
,
betook
themselves
to
their
stakes
,
and
driving
the
two
into
the
*NL*
middle
they
began
to
lay
on
with
great
zeal
and
energy
;
in
fact
,
at
the
*NL*
second
blow
they
brought
Sancho
to
the
ground
,
and
Don
Quixote
fared
the
*NL*
same
way
,
all
his
skill
and
high
mettle
availing
him
nothing
,
and
fate
*NL*
willed
it
that
he
should
fall
at
the
feet
of
Rocinante
,
who
had
not
yet
*NL*
risen
;
whereby
it
may
be
seen
how
furiously
stakes
can
pound
in
angry
*NL*
boorish
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
seeing
the
mischief
they
had
done
,
the
Yanguesans
with
all
the
*NL*
haste
they
could
loaded
their
team
and
pursued
their
journey
,
leaving
the
*NL*
two
adventurers
a
sorry
sight
and
in
sorrier
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
the
first
to
come
to
,
and
finding
himself
close
to
his
master
*NL*
he
called
to
him
in
a
weak
and
doleful
voice
,
``
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
ah
,
*NL*
Senor
Don
Quixote
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
wouldst
thou
,
brother
Sancho
?
''
answered
Don
Quixote
in
the
same
*NL*
feeble
suffering
tone
as
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
like
,
if
it
were
possible
,
''
answered
Sancho
Panza
,
``
your
worship
*NL*
to
give
me
a
couple
of
sups
of
that
potion
of
the
fiery
Blas
,
if
it
be
*NL*
that
you
have
any
to
hand
there
;
perhaps
it
will
serve
for
broken
bones
*NL*
as
well
as
for
wounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
only
had
it
here
,
wretch
that
I
am
,
what
more
should
we
want
?
''
said
*NL*
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
I
swear
to
thee
,
Sancho
Panza
,
on
the
faith
of
a
*NL*
knight-errant
,
ere
two
days
are
over
,
unless
fortune
orders
otherwise
,
I
*NL*
mean
to
have
it
in
my

or
my
hand
will
have
lost
its
cunning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
how
many
does
your
worship
think
we
shall
have
the
use
of
our
*NL*
feet
?
''
answered
Sancho
Panza
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
myself
I
must
say
I
can
not
guess
how
many
,
''
said
the
battered
knight
*NL*
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
I
take
all
the
blame
upon
myself
,
for
I
had
no
business
*NL*
to
put
hand
to
sword
against
men
who
where
not
dubbed
knights
like
*NL*
myself
,
and
so
I
believe
that
in
punishment
for
having
transgressed
the
*NL*
laws
of
chivalry
the
God
of
battles
has
permitted
this
chastisement
to
be
*NL*
administered
to
me
;
for
which
reason
,
brother
Sancho
,
it
is
well
thou
*NL*
shouldst
receive
a
hint
on
the
matter
which
I
am
now
about
to
mention
to
*NL*
thee
,
for
it
is
of
much
importance
to
the
welfare
of
both
of
us
.
It
is
at
*NL*
when
thou
shalt
see
rabble
of
this
sort
offering
us
insult
thou
art
not
*NL*
to
wait
till
I
draw
sword
against
them
,
for
I
shall
not
do
so
at
all
;
but
*NL*
do
thou
draw
sword
and
chastise
them
to
thy
heart
's
content
,
and
if
any
*NL*
knights
come
to
their
aid
and
defence
I
will
take
care
to
defend
thee
and
*NL*
assail
them
with
all
my
might
;
and
thou
hast
already
seen
by
a
thousand
*NL*
signs
and
proofs
what
the
might
of
this
strong
arm
of
mine
is
equal
*NL*
to
''
--
so
uplifted
had
the
poor
gentleman
become
through
the
victory
over
*NL*
the
stout
Biscayan
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sancho
did
not
so
fully
approve
of
his
master
's
admonition
as
to
let
*NL*
it
pass
without
saying
in
reply
,
``
Senor
,
I
am
a
man
of
peace
,
meek
and
*NL*
quiet
,
and
I
can
put
up
with
any
affront
because
I
have
a
wife
and
*NL*
children
to
support
and
bring
up
;
so
let
it
be
likewise
a
hint
to
your
*NL*
worship
,
as
it
can
not
be
a
mandate
,
that
on
no
account
will
I
draw
sword
*NL*
either
against
clown
or
against
knight
,
and
that
here
before
God
I
*NL*
forgive
the
insults
that
have
been
offered
me
,
whether
they
have
been
,
*NL*
are
,
or
shall
be
offered
me
by
high
or
low
,
rich
or
poor
,
noble
or
*NL*
commoner
,
not
excepting
any
rank
or
condition
whatsoever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
which
his
master
said
in
reply
,
``
I
wish
I
had
breath
enough
to
*NL*
speak
somewhat
easily
,
and
that
the
pain
I
feel
on
this
side
would
abate
*NL*
so
as
to
let
me
explain
to
thee
,
Panza
,
the
mistake
thou
makest
.
Come
*NL*
now
,
sinner
,
suppose
the
wind
of
fortune
,
hitherto
so
adverse
,
should
*NL*
turn
in
our
favour
,
filling
the
sails
of
our
desires
so
that
safely
and
*NL*
without
impediment
we
put
into
port
in
some
one
of
those
islands
I
have
*NL*
promised
thee
,
how
would
it
be
with
thee
if
on
winning
it
I
made
thee
*NL*
lord
of
it
?
Why
,
thou
wilt
make
it
well-nigh
impossible
through
not
being
*NL*
a
knight
nor
having
any
desire
to
be
one
,
nor
possessing
the
courage
nor
*NL*
the
will
to
avenge
insults
or
defend
thy
lordship
;
for
thou
must
know
*NL*
that
in
newly
conquered
kingdoms
and
provinces
the
minds
of
the
*NL*
inhabitants
are
never
so
quiet
nor
so
well
disposed
to
the
new
lord
that
*NL*
there
is
no
fear
of
their
making
some
move
to
change
matters
once
more
,
*NL*
and
try
,
as
they
say
,
what
chance
may
do
for
them
;
so
it
is
essential
*NL*
that
the
new
possessor
should
have
good
sense
to
enable
him
to
govern
,
*NL*
and
valour
to
attack
and
defend
himself
,
whatever
may
befall
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
has
now
befallen
us
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
I
'd
have
been
well
*NL*
pleased
to
have
that
good
sense
and
that
valour
your
worship
speaks
of
,
*NL*
but
I
swear
on
the
faith
of
a
poor
man
I
am
more
fit
for
plasters
than
*NL*
for
arguments
.
See
if
your
worship
can
get
up
,
and
let
us
help
Rocinante
,
*NL*
though
he
does
not
deserve
it
,
for
he
was
the
main
cause
of
all
this
*NL*
thrashing
.
I
never
thought
it
of
Rocinante
,
for
I
took
him
to
be
a
*NL*
virtuous
person
and
as
quiet
as
myself
.
After
all
,
they
say
right
that
it
*NL*
takes
a
long
time
to
come
to
know
people
,
and
that
there
is
nothing
sure
*NL*
in
this
life
.
Who
would
have
said
that
,
after
such
mighty
slashes
as
your
*NL*
worship
gave
that
unlucky
knight-errant
,
there
was
coming
,
travelling
*NL*
post
and
at
the
very
heels
of
them
,
such
a
great
storm
of
sticks
as
has
*NL*
fallen
upon
our
shoulders
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
thine
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
ought
to
be
used
to
such
*NL*
squalls
;
but
mine
,
reared
in
soft
cloth
and
fine
linen
,
it
is
plain
they
*NL*
must
feel
more
keenly
the
pain
of
this
mishap
,
and
if
it
were
not
that
I
*NL*
imagine
--
why
do
I
say
imagine
?
--
know
of
a
certainty
that
all
these
*NL*
annoyances
are
very
necessary
accompaniments
of
the
calling
of
arms
,
I
*NL*
would
lay
me
down
here
to
die
of
pure
vexation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
squire
replied
,
``
Senor
,
as
these
mishaps
are
what
one
reaps
*NL*
of
chivalry
,
tell
me
if
they
happen
very
often
,
or
if
they
have
their
own
*NL*
fixed
times
for
coming
to
pass
;
because
it
seems
to
me
that
after
two
*NL*
harvests
we
shall
be
no
good
for
the
third
,
unless
God
in
his
infinite
*NL*
mercy
helps
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
,
friend
Sancho
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
the
life
of
*NL*
knights-errant
is
subject
to
a
thousand
dangers
and
reverses
,
and
neither
*NL*
more
nor
less
is
it
within
immediate
possibility
for
knights-errant
to
*NL*
become
kings
and
emperors
,
as
experience
has
shown
in
the
case
of
many
*NL*
different
knights
with
whose
histories
I
am
thoroughly
acquainted
;
and
I
*NL*
could
tell
thee
now
,
if
the
pain
would
let
me
,
of
some
who
simply
by
*NL*
might
of
arm
have
risen
to
the
high
stations
I
have
mentioned
;
and
those
*NL*
same
,
both
before
and
after
,
experienced
divers
misfortunes
and
miseries
;
*NL*
for
the
valiant
Amadis
of
Gaul
found
himself
in
the
power
of
his
mortal
*NL*
enemy
Arcalaus
the
magician
,
who
,
it
is
positively
asserted
,
holding
him
*NL*
captive
,
gave
him
more
than
two
hundred
lashes
with
the
reins
of
his
*NL*
horse
while
tied
to
one
of
the
pillars
of
a
court
;
and
moreover
there
is
*NL*
a
certain
recondite
author
of
no
small
authority
who
says
that
the
Knight
*NL*
of
Phoebus
,
being
caught
in
a
certain
pitfall
,
which
opened
under
his
*NL*
feet
in
a
certain
castle
,
on
falling
found
himself
bound
hand
and
foot
in
*NL*
a
deep
pit
underground
,
where
they
administered
to
him
one
of
those
*NL*
things
they
call
clysters
,
of
sand
and
snow-water
,
that
well-nigh
*NL*
finished
him
;
and
if
he
had
not
been
succoured
in
that
sore
extremity
by
*NL*
a
sage
,
a
great
friend
of
his
,
it
would
have
gone
very
hard
with
the
poor
*NL*
knight
;
so
I
may
well
suffer
in
company
with
such
worthy
folk
,
for
*NL*
greater
were
the
indignities
which
they
had
to
suffer
than
those
which
we
*NL*
suffer
.
For
I
would
have
thee
know
,
Sancho
,
that
wounds
caused
by
any
*NL*
instruments
which
happen
by
chance
to
be
in
hand
inflict
no
indignity
,
*NL*
and
this
is
laid
down
in
the
law
of
the
duel
in
express
words
:
if
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
the
cobbler
strikes
another
with
the
last
which
he
has
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
though
it
be
in
fact
a
piece
of
wood
,
it
can
not
be
said
for
that
*NL*
reason
that
he
whom
he
struck
with
it
has
been
cudgelled
.
I
say
this
lest
*NL*
thou
shouldst
imagine
that
because
we
have
been
drubbed
in
this
affray
we
*NL*
have
therefore
suffered
any
indignity
;
for
the
arms
those
men
carried
,
*NL*
with
which
they
pounded
us
,
were
nothing
more
than
their
stakes
,
and
not
*NL*
one
of
them
,
so
far
as
I
remember
,
carried
rapier
,
sword
,
or
dagger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
gave
me
no
time
to
see
that
much
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
for
hardly
had
*NL*
I
laid
hand
on
my
tizona
when
they
signed
the
cross
on
my
shoulders
with
*NL*
their
sticks
in
such
style
that
they
took
the
sight
out
of
my
eyes
and
*NL*
the
strength
out
of
my
feet
,
stretching
me
where
I
now
lie
,
and
where
*NL*
thinking
of
whether
all
those
stake-strokes
were
an
indignity
or
not
*NL*
gives
me
no
uneasiness
,
which
the
pain
of
the
blows
does
,
for
they
will
*NL*
remain
as
deeply
impressed
on
my
memory
as
on
my
shoulders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
let
me
tell
thee
,
brother
Panza
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
*NL*
there
is
no
recollection
which
time
does
not
put
an
end
to
,
and
no
pain
*NL*
which
death
does
not
remove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
greater
misfortune
can
there
be
,
''
replied
Panza
,
``
than
the
one
*NL*
that
waits
for
time
to
put
an
end
to
it
and
death
to
remove
it
?
If
our
*NL*
mishap
were
one
of
those
that
are
cured
with
a
couple
of
plasters
,
it
*NL*
would
not
be
so
bad
;
but
I
am
beginning
to
think
that
all
the
plasters
in
*NL*
a
hospital
almost
wo
n't
be
enough
to
put
us
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
of
that
:
pluck
strength
out
of
weakness
,
Sancho
,
as
I
mean
to
*NL*
do
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
let
us
see
how
Rocinante
is
,
for
it
seems
*NL*
to
me
that
not
the
least
share
of
this
mishap
has
fallen
to
the
lot
of
*NL*
the
poor
beast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
wonderful
in
that
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
since
he
is
a
*NL*
knight-errant
too
;
what
I
wonder
at
is
that
my
beast
should
have
come
off
*NL*
scot-free
where
we
come
out
scotched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortune
always
leaves
a
door
open
in
adversity
in
order
to
bring
relief
*NL*
to
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
I
say
so
because
this
little
beast
may
now
*NL*
supply
the
want
of
Rocinante
,
carrying
me
hence
to
some
castle
where
I
*NL*
may
be
cured
of
my
wounds
.
And
moreover
I
shall
not
hold
it
any
dishonour
*NL*
to
be
so
mounted
,
for
I
remember
having
read
how
the
good
old
Silenus
,
*NL*
the
tutor
and
instructor
of
the
gay
god
of
laughter
,
when
he
entered
the
*NL*
city
of
the
hundred
gates
,
went
very
contentedly
mounted
on
a
handsome
*NL*
ass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
true
that
he
went
mounted
as
your
worship
says
,
''
answered
*NL*
Sancho
,
``
but
there
is
a
great
difference
between
going
mounted
and
going
*NL*
slung
like
a
sack
of
manure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
Wounds
received
in
battle
confer
honour
*NL*
instead
of
taking
it
away
;
and
so
,
friend
Panza
,
say
no
more
,
but
,
as
I
*NL*
told
thee
before
,
get
up
as
well
as
thou
canst
and
put
me
on
top
of
thy
*NL*
beast
in
whatever
fashion
pleases
thee
best
,
and
let
us
go
hence
ere
*NL*
night
come
on
and
surprise
us
in
these
wilds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
have
heard
your
worship
say
,
''
observed
Panza
,
``
that
it
is
very
*NL*
meet
for
knights-errant
to
sleep
in
wastes
and
deserts
,
and
that
they
*NL*
esteem
it
very
good
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
when
they
can
not
help
it
,
or
when
they
are
*NL*
in
love
;
and
so
true
is
this
that
there
have
been
knights
who
have
*NL*
remained
two
years
on
rocks
,
in
sunshine
and
shade
and
all
the
*NL*
inclemencies
of
heaven
,
without
their
ladies
knowing
anything
of
it
;
and
*NL*
one
of
these
was
Amadis
,
when
,
under
the
name
of
Beltenebros
,
he
took
up
*NL*
his
abode
on
the
Pena
Pobre
for
--
I
know
not
if
it
was
eight
years
or
*NL*
eight
months
,
for
I
am
not
very
sure
of
the
reckoning
;
at
any
rate
he
*NL*
stayed
there
doing
penance
for
I
know
not
what
pique
the
Princess
Oriana
*NL*
had
against
him
;
but
no
more
of
this
now
,
Sancho
,
and
make
haste
before
a
*NL*
mishap
like
Rocinante
's
befalls
the
ass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
devil
would
be
in
it
in
that
case
,
''
said
Sancho
;
and
letting
*NL*
off
thirty
``
ohs
,
''
and
sixty
sighs
,
and
a
hundred
and
twenty
maledictions
*NL*
and
execrations
on
whomsoever
it
was
that
had
brought
him
there
,
he
*NL*
raised
himself
,
stopping
half-way
bent
like
a
Turkish
bow
without
power
*NL*
to
bring
himself
upright
,
but
with
all
his
pains
he
saddled
his
ass
,
who
*NL*
too
had
gone
astray
somewhat
,
yielding
to
the
excessive
licence
of
the
*NL*
day
;
he
next
raised
up
Rocinante
,
and
as
for
him
,
had
he
possessed
a
*NL*
tongue
to
complain
with
,
most
assuredly
neither
Sancho
nor
his
master
*NL*
would
have
been
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
brief
,
Sancho
fixed
Don
Quixote
on
the
ass
and
secured
Rocinante
*NL*
with
a
leading
rein
,
and
taking
the
ass
by
the
halter
,
he
proceeded
more
*NL*
or
less
in
the
direction
in
which
it
seemed
to
him
the
high
road
might
*NL*
be
;
and
,
as
chance
was
conducting
their
affairs
for
them
from
good
to
*NL*
better
,
he
had
not
gone
a
short
league
when
the
road
came
in
sight
,
and
*NL*
on
it
he
perceived
an
inn
,
which
to
his
annoyance
and
to
the
delight
of
*NL*
Don
Quixote
must
needs
be
a
castle
.
Sancho
insisted
that
it
was
an
inn
,
*NL*
and
his
master
that
it
was
not
one
,
but
a
castle
,
and
the
dispute
lasted
*NL*
so
long
that
before
the
point
was
settled
they
had
time
to
reach
it
,
and
*NL*
into
it
Sancho
entered
with
all
his
team
without
any
further
controversy
.

CHAPTER
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
THE
INGENIOUS
GENTLEMAN
IN
THE
INN
WHICH
HE
TOOK
TO
*NL*
BE
A
CASTLE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
innkeeper
,
seeing
Don
Quixote
slung
across
the
ass
,
asked
Sancho
what
*NL*
was
amiss
with
him
.
Sancho
answered
that
it
was
nothing
,
only
that
he
had
*NL*
fallen
down
from
a
rock
and
had
his
ribs
a
little
bruised
.
The
innkeeper
*NL*
had
a
wife
whose
disposition
was
not
such
as
those
of
her
calling
*NL*
commonly
have
,
for
she
was
by
nature
kind-hearted
and
felt
for
the
*NL*
sufferings
of
her
neighbours
,
so
she
at
once
set
about
tending
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
and
made
her
young
daughter
,
a
very
comely
girl
,
help
her
in
*NL*
taking
care
of
her
guest
.
There
was
besides
in
the
inn
,
as
servant
,
an
*NL*
Asturian
lass
with
a
broad
face
,
flat
poll
,
and
snub
nose
,
blind
of
one
*NL*
eye
and
not
very
sound
in
the
other
.
The
elegance
of
her
shape
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
made
up
for
all
her
defects
;
she
did
not
measure
seven
palms
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
,
and
her
shoulders
,
which
overweighted
her
somewhat
,
made
*NL*
her
contemplate
the
ground
more
than
she
liked
.
This
graceful
lass
,
then
,
*NL*
helped
the
young
girl
,
and
the
two
made
up
a
very
bad
bed
for
Don
Quixote
*NL*
in
a
garret
that
showed
evident
signs
of
having
formerly
served
for
many
*NL*
years
as
a
straw-loft
,
in
which
there
was
also
quartered
a
carrier
whose
*NL*
bed
was
placed
a
little
beyond
our
Don
Quixote
's
,
and
,
though
only
made
*NL*
of
the
pack-saddles
and
cloths
of
his
mules
,
had
much
the
advantage
of
*NL*
it
,
as
Don
Quixote
's
consisted
simply
of
four
rough
boards
on
two
not
*NL*
very
even
trestles
,
a
mattress
,
that
for
thinness
might
have
passed
for
a
*NL*
quilt
,
full
of
pellets
which
,
were
they
not
seen
through
the
rents
to
be
*NL*
wool
,
would
to
the
touch
have
seemed
pebbles
in
hardness
,
two
sheets
made
*NL*
of
buckler
leather
,
and
a
coverlet
the
threads
of
which
anyone
that
chose
*NL*
might
have
counted
without
missing
one
in
the
reckoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
accursed
bed
Don
Quixote
stretched
himself
,
and
the
hostess
and
*NL*
her
daughter
soon
covered
him
with
plasters
from
top
to
toe
,
while
*NL*
Maritornes
--
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
Asturian
--
held
the
light
for
*NL*
them
,
and
while
plastering
him
,
the
hostess
,
observing
how
full
of
wheals
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
in
some
places
,
remarked
that
this
had
more
the
look
of
*NL*
blows
than
of
a
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
blows
,
Sancho
said
,
but
that
the
rock
had
many
points
and
*NL*
projections
,
and
that
each
of
them
had
left
its
mark
.
``
Pray
,
senora
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
manage
to
save
some
tow
,
as
there
will
be
no
want
of
some
one
to
*NL*
use
it
,
for
my
loins
too
are
rather
sore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
have
fallen
too
,
''
said
the
hostess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
fall
,
''
said
Sancho
Panza
,
``
but
from
the
shock
I
got
at
seeing
*NL*
my
master
fall
,
my
body
aches
so
that
I
feel
as
if
I
had
had
a
thousand
*NL*
thwacks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
well
be
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
``
for
it
has
many
a
time
happened
*NL*
to
me
to
dream
that
I
was
falling
down
from
a
tower
and
never
coming
to
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
when
I
awoke
from
the
dream
to
find
myself
as
weak
and
*NL*
shaken
as
if
I
had
really
fallen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
the
point
,
senora
,
''
replied
Sancho
Panza
,
``
that
I
without
*NL*
dreaming
at
all
,
but
being
more
awake
than
I
am
now
,
find
myself
with
*NL*
scarcely
less
wheals
than
my
master
,
Don
Quixote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
the
gentleman
called
?
''
asked
Maritornes
the
Asturian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
''
answered
Sancho
Panza
,
``
and
he
is
a
*NL*
knight-adventurer
,
and
one
of
the
best
and
stoutest
that
have
been
seen
*NL*
in
the
world
this
long
time
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
a
knight-adventurer
?
''
said
the
lass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
so
new
in
the
world
as
not
to
know
?
''
answered
Sancho
Panza
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
you
must
know
,
sister
,
that
a
knight-adventurer
is
a
thing
*NL*
that
in
two
words
is
seen
drubbed
and
emperor
,
that
is
to-day
the
most
*NL*
miserable
and
needy
being
in
the
world
,
and
to-morrow
will
have
two
or
*NL*
three
crowns
of
kingdoms
to
give
his
squire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
is
it
,
''
said
the
hostess
,
``
that
belonging
to
so
good
a
master
*NL*
as
this
,
you
have
not
,
to
judge
by
appearances
,
even
so
much
as
a
*NL*
county
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
soon
yet
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
for
we
have
only
been
a
month
*NL*
going
in
quest
of
adventures
,
and
so
far
we
have
met
with
nothing
that
*NL*
can
be
called
one
,
for
it
will
happen
that
when
one
thing
is
looked
for
*NL*
another
thing
is
found
;
however
,
if
my
master
Don
Quixote
gets
well
of
*NL*
this
wound
,
or
fall
,
and
I
am
left
none
the
worse
of
it
,
I
would
not
*NL*
change
my
hopes
for
the
best
title
in
Spain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
conversation
Don
Quixote
was
listening
very
attentively
,
and
*NL*
sitting
up
in
bed
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
taking
the
hostess
by
the
hand
*NL*
he
said
to
her
,
``
Believe
me
,
fair
lady
,
you
may
call
yourself
fortunate
*NL*
in
having
in
this
castle
of
yours
sheltered
my
person
,
which
is
such
that
*NL*
if
I
do
not
myself
praise
it
,
it
is
because
of
what
is
commonly
said
,
*NL*
that
self-praise
debaseth
;
but
my
squire
will
inform
you
who
I
am
.
I
only
*NL*
tell
you
that
I
shall
preserve
for
ever
inscribed
on
my
memory
the
*NL*
service
you
have
rendered
me
in
order
to
tender
you
my
gratitude
while
*NL*
life
shall
last
me
;
and
would
to
Heaven
love
held
me
not
so
enthralled
*NL*
and
subject
to
its
laws
and
to
the
eyes
of
that
fair
ingrate
whom
I
name
*NL*
between
my
teeth
,
but
that
those
of
this
lovely
damsel
might
be
the
*NL*
masters
of
my
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hostess
,
her
daughter
,
and
the
worthy
Maritornes
listened
in
*NL*
bewilderment
to
the
words
of
the
knight-errant
;
for
they
understood
about
*NL*
as
much
of
them
as
if
he
had
been
talking
Greek
,
though
they
could
*NL*
perceive
they
were
all
meant
for
expressions
of
good-will
and
*NL*
blandishments
;
and
not
being
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
language
,
they
*NL*
stared
at
him
and
wondered
to
themselves
,
for
he
seemed
to
them
a
man
of
*NL*
a
different
sort
from
those
they
were
used
to
,
and
thanking
him
in
*NL*
pothouse
phrase
for
his
civility
they
left
him
,
while
the
Asturian
gave
*NL*
her
attention
to
Sancho
,
who
needed
it
no
less
than
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carrier
had
made
an
arrangement
with
her
for
recreation
that
night
,
*NL*
and
she
had
given
him
her
word
that
when
the
guests
were
quiet
and
the
*NL*
family
asleep
she
would
come
in
search
of
him
and
meet
his
wishes
*NL*
unreservedly
.
And
it
is
said
of
this
good
lass
that
she
never
made
*NL*
promises
of
the
kind
without
fulfilling
them
,
even
though
she
made
them
*NL*
in
a
forest
and
without
any
witness
present
,
for
she
plumed
herself
*NL*
greatly
on
being
a
lady
and
held
it
no
disgrace
to
be
in
such
an
*NL*
employment
as
servant
in
an
inn
,
because
,
she
said
,
misfortunes
and
*NL*
ill-luck
had
brought
her
to
that
position
.
The
hard
,
narrow
,
wretched
,
*NL*
rickety
bed
of
Don
Quixote
stood
first
in
the
middle
of
this
star-lit
*NL*
stable
,
and
close
beside
it
Sancho
made
his
,
which
merely
consisted
of
a
*NL*
rush
mat
and
a
blanket
that
looked
as
if
it
was
of
threadbare
canvas
*NL*
rather
than
of
wool
.
Next
to
these
two
beds
was
that
of
the
carrier
,
made
*NL*
up
,
as
has
been
said
,
of
the
pack-saddles
and
all
the
trappings
of
the
*NL*
two
best
mules
he
had
,
though
there
were
twelve
of
them
,
sleek
,
plump
,
*NL*
and
in
prime
condition
,
for
he
was
one
of
the
rich
carriers
of
Arevalo
,
*NL*
according
to
the
author
of
this
history
,
who
particularly
mentions
this
*NL*
carrier
because
he
knew
him
very
well
,
and
they
even
say
was
in
some
*NL*
degree
a
relation
of
his
;
besides
which
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
was
a
*NL*
historian
of
great
research
and
accuracy
in
all
things
,
as
is
very
*NL*
evident
since
he
would
not
pass
over
in
silence
those
that
have
been
*NL*
already
mentioned
,
however
trifling
and
insignificant
they
might
be
,
an
*NL*
example
that
might
be
followed
by
those
grave
historians
who
relate
*NL*
transactions
so
curtly
and
briefly
that
we
hardly
get
a
taste
of
them
,
*NL*
all
the
substance
of
the
work
being
left
in
the
inkstand
from
*NL*
carelessness
,
perverseness
,
or
ignorance
.
A
thousand
blessings
on
the
*NL*
author
of
``
Tablante
de
Ricamonte
''
and
that
of
the
other
book
in
which
the
*NL*
deeds
of
the
Conde
Tomillas
are
recounted
;
with
what
minuteness
they
*NL*
describe
everything
!
*NL*
*NL*
To
proceed
,
then
:
after
having
paid
a
visit
to
his
team
and
given
them
*NL*
their
second
feed
,
the
carrier
stretched
himself
on
his
pack-saddles
and
*NL*
lay
waiting
for
his
conscientious
Maritornes
.
Sancho
was
by
this
time
*NL*
plastered
and
had
lain
down
,
and
though
he
strove
to
sleep
the
pain
of
*NL*
his
ribs
would
not
let
him
,
while
Don
Quixote
with
the
pain
of
his
had
*NL*
his
eyes
as
wide
open
as
a
hare
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inn
was
all
in
silence
,
and
in
the
whole
of
it
there
was
no
light
*NL*
except
that
given
by
a
lantern
that
hung
burning
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
gateway
.
This
strange
stillness
,
and
the
thoughts
,
always
present
to
our
*NL*
knight
's
mind
,
of
the
incidents
described
at
every
turn
in
the
books
that
*NL*
were
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
,
conjured
up
to
his
imagination
as
*NL*
extraordinary
a
delusion
as
can
well
be
conceived
,
which
was
that
he
*NL*
fancied
himself
to
have
reached
a
famous
castle
-LRB-
for
,
as
has
been
said
,
*NL*
all
the
inns
he
lodged
in
were
castles
to
his
eyes
-RRB-
,
and
that
the
*NL*
daughter
of
the
innkeeper
was
daughter
of
the
lord
of
the
castle
,
and
*NL*
that
she
,
won
by
his
high-bred
bearing
,
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
,
and
*NL*
had
promised
to
come
to
his
bed
for
a
while
that
night
without
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
her
parents
;
and
holding
all
this
fantasy
that
he
had
*NL*
constructed
as
solid
fact
,
he
began
to
feel
uneasy
and
to
consider
the
*NL*
perilous
risk
which
his
virtue
was
about
to
encounter
,
and
he
resolved
in
*NL*
his
heart
to
commit
no
treason
to
his
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
even
*NL*
though
the
queen
Guinevere
herself
and
the
dame
Quintanona
should
present
*NL*
themselves
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
taken
up
with
these
vagaries
,
then
,
the
time
and
the
*NL*
hour
--
an
unlucky
one
for
him
--
arrived
for
the
Asturian
to
come
,
who
in
*NL*
her
smock
,
with
bare
feet
and
her
hair
gathered
into
a
fustian
coif
,
with
*NL*
noiseless
and
cautious
steps
entered
the
chamber
where
the
three
were
*NL*
quartered
,
in
quest
of
the
carrier
;
but
scarcely
had
she
gained
the
door
*NL*
when
Don
Quixote
perceived
her
,
and
sitting
up
in
his
bed
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
plasters
and
the
pain
of
his
ribs
,
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
receive
*NL*
his
beauteous
damsel
.
The
Asturian
,
who
went
all
doubled
up
and
in
*NL*
silence
with
her
hands
before
her
feeling
for
her
lover
,
encountered
the
*NL*
arms
of
Don
Quixote
,
who
grasped
her
tightly
by
the
wrist
,
and
drawing
*NL*
her
towards
him
,
while
she
dared
not
utter
a
word
,
made
her
sit
down
on
*NL*
the
bed
.
He
then
felt
her
smock
,
and
although
it
was
of
sackcloth
it
*NL*
appeared
to
him
to
be
of
the
finest
and
softest
silk
:
on
her
wrists
she
*NL*
wore
some
glass
beads
,
but
to
him
they
had
the
sheen
of
precious
Orient
*NL*
pearls
:
her
hair
,
which
in
some
measure
resembled
a
horse
's
mane
,
he
*NL*
rated
as
threads
of
the
brightest
gold
of
Araby
,
whose
refulgence
dimmed
*NL*
the
sun
himself
:
her
breath
,
which
no
doubt
smelt
of
yesterday
's
stale
*NL*
salad
,
seemed
to
him
to
diffuse
a
sweet
aromatic
fragrance
from
her
*NL*
mouth
;
and
,
in
short
,
he
drew
her
portrait
in
his
imagination
with
the
*NL*
same
features
and
in
the
same
style
as
that
which
he
had
seen
in
his
*NL*
books
of
the
other
princesses
who
,
smitten
by
love
,
came
with
all
the
*NL*
adornments
that
are
here
set
down
,
to
see
the
sorely
wounded
knight
;
and
*NL*
so
great
was
the
poor
gentleman
's
blindness

anything

would
have
made
any

*NL*
a
carrier
vomit
,
were
enough
to
undeceive
him
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
*NL*
persuaded
he
had
the
goddess
of
beauty
in
his
arms
,
and
holding
her
*NL*
firmly
in
his
grasp
he
went
on
to
say
in
low
,
tender
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
that
found
myself
,
lovely
and
exalted
lady
,
in
a
position
to
repay
*NL*
such
a
favour
as
that
which
you
,
by
the
sight
of
your
great
beauty
,
have
*NL*
granted
me
;
but
fortune
,
which
is
never
weary
of
persecuting
the
good
,
*NL*
has
chosen
to
place
me
upon
this
bed
,
where
I
lie
so
bruised
and
broken
*NL*
that
though
my
inclination
would
gladly
comply
with
yours
it
is
*NL*
impossible
;
besides
,
to
this
impossibility
another
yet
greater
is
to
be
*NL*
added
,
which
is
the
faith
that
I
have
pledged
to
the
peerless
Dulcinea
*NL*
del
Toboso
,
sole
lady
of
my
most
secret
thoughts
;
and
were
it
not
that
*NL*
this
stood
in
the
way
I
should
not
be
so
insensible
a
knight
as
to
miss
*NL*
the
happy
opportunity
which
your
great
goodness
has
offered
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maritornes
was
fretting
and
sweating
at
finding
herself
held
so
fast
by
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
and
not
understanding
or
heeding
the
words
he
addressed
to
*NL*
her
,
she
strove
without
speaking
to
free
herself
.
The
worthy
carrier
,
*NL*
whose
unholy
thoughts
kept
him
awake
,
was
aware
of
his
doxy
the
moment
*NL*
she
entered
the
door
,
and
was
listening
attentively
to
all
Don
Quixote
*NL*
said
;
and
jealous
that
the
Asturian
should
have
broken
her
word
with
him
*NL*
for
another
,
drew
nearer
to
Don
Quixote
's
bed
and
stood
still
to
see
what
*NL*
would
come
of
this
talk
which
he
could
not
understand
;
but
when
he
*NL*
perceived
the
wench
struggling
to
get
free
and
Don
Quixote
striving
to
*NL*
hold
her
,
not
relishing
the
joke
he
raised
his
arm
and
delivered
such
a
*NL*
terrible
cuff
on
the
lank
jaws
of
the
amorous
knight
that
he
bathed
all
*NL*
his
mouth
in
blood
,
and
not
content
with
this
he
mounted
on
his
ribs
and
*NL*
with
his
feet
tramped
all
over
them
at
a
pace
rather
smarter
than
a
trot
.
*NL*
The
bed
which
was
somewhat
crazy
and
not
very
firm
on
its
feet
,
unable
to
*NL*
support
the
additional
weight
of
the
carrier
,
came
to
the
ground
,
and
at
*NL*
the
mighty
crash
of
this
the
innkeeper
awoke
and
at
once
concluded
that
*NL*
it
must
be
some
brawl
of
Maritornes
'
,
because
after
calling
loudly
to
her
*NL*
he
got
no
answer
.
With
this
suspicion
he
got
up
,
and
lighting
a
lamp
*NL*
hastened
to
the
quarter
where
he
had
heard
the
disturbance
.
The
wench
,
*NL*
seeing
that
her
master
was
coming
and
knowing
that
his
temper
was
*NL*
terrible
,
frightened
and
panic-stricken
made
for
the
bed
of
Sancho
Panza
,
*NL*
who
still
slept
,
and
crouching
upon
it
made
a
ball
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
innkeeper
came
in
exclaiming
,
``
Where
art
thou
,
strumpet
?
Of
course
*NL*
this
is
some
of
thy
work
.
''
At
this
Sancho
awoke
,
and
feeling
this
mass
*NL*
almost
on
top
of
him
fancied
he
had
the
nightmare
and
began
to
distribute
*NL*
fisticuffs
all
round
,
of
which
a
certain
share
fell
upon
Maritornes
,
who
,
*NL*
irritated
by
the
pain
and
flinging
modesty
aside
,
paid
back
so
many
in
*NL*
return
to
Sancho
that
she
woke
him
up
in
spite
of
himself
.
He
then
,
*NL*
finding
himself
so
handled
,
by
whom
he
knew
not
,
raising
himself
up
as
*NL*
well
as
he
could
,
grappled
with
Maritornes
,
and
he
and
she
between
them
*NL*
began
the
bitterest
and
drollest
scrimmage
in
the
world
.
The
carrier
,
*NL*
however
,
perceiving
by
the
light
of
the
innkeeper
candle
how
it
fared
*NL*
with
his
ladylove
,
quitting
Don
Quixote
,
ran
to
bring
her
the
help
she
*NL*
needed
;
and
the
innkeeper
did
the
same
but
with
a
different
intention
,
*NL*
for
his
was
to
chastise
the
lass
,
as
he
believed
that
beyond
a
doubt
she
*NL*
alone
was
the
cause
of
all
the
harmony
.
And
so
,
as
the
saying
is
,
cat
to
*NL*
rat
,
rat
to
rope
,
rope
to
stick
,
the
carrier
pounded
Sancho
,
Sancho
the
*NL*
lass
,
she
him
,
and
the
innkeeper
her
,
and
all
worked
away
so
briskly
that
*NL*
they
did
not
give
themselves
a
moment
's
rest
;
and
the
best
of
it
was
that
*NL*
the
innkeeper
's
lamp
went
out
,
and
as
they
were
left
in
the
dark
they
all
*NL*
laid
on
one
upon
the
other
in
a
mass
so
unmercifully
that
there
was
not
a
*NL*
sound
spot
left
where
a
hand
could
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
there
was
lodging
that
night
in
the
inn
a
caudrillero
*NL*
of
what
they
call
the
Old
Holy
Brotherhood
of
Toledo
,
who
,
also
hearing
*NL*
the
extraordinary
noise
of
the
conflict
,
seized
his
staff
and
the
tin
*NL*
case
with
his
warrants
,
and
made
his
way
in
the
dark
into
the
room
*NL*
crying
:
``
Hold
!
in
the
name
of
the
Jurisdiction
!
Hold
!
in
the
name
of
the
*NL*
Holy
Brotherhood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
that
he
came
upon
was
the
pummelled
Don
Quixote
,
who
lay
*NL*
stretched
senseless
on
his
back
upon
his
broken-down
bed
,
and
,
his
hand
*NL*
falling
on
the
beard
as
he
felt
about
,
he
continued
to
cry
,
``
Help
for
the
*NL*
Jurisdiction
!
''
but
perceiving
that
he
whom
he
had
laid
hold
of
did
not
*NL*
move
or
stir
,
he
concluded
that
he
was
dead
and
that
those
in
the
room
*NL*
were
his
murderers
,
and
with
this
suspicion
he
raised
his
voice
still
*NL*
higher
,
calling
out
,
``
Shut
the
inn
gate
;
see
that
no
one
goes
out
;
they
*NL*
have
killed
a
man
here
!
''
This
cry
startled
them
all
,
and
each
dropped
the
*NL*
contest
at
the
point
at
which
the
voice
reached
him
.
The
innkeeper
*NL*
retreated
to
his
room
,
the
carrier
to
his
pack-saddles
,
the
lass
to
her
*NL*
crib
;
the
unlucky
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
alone
were
unable
to
move
from
*NL*
where
they
were
.
The
cuadrillero
on
this
let
go
Don
Quixote
's
beard
,
and
*NL*
went
out
to
look
for
a
light
to
search
for
and
apprehend
the
culprits
;
*NL*
but
not
finding
one
,
as
the
innkeeper
had
purposely
extinguished
the
*NL*
lantern
on
retreating
to
his
room
,
he
was
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
*NL*
the
hearth
,
where
after
much
time
and
trouble
he
lit
another
lamp
.

IN

THE

TROUBLES

THE
BRAVE
DON

QUIXOTE
AND
HIS
GOOD
SQUIRE

MISFORTUNE
HE
TOOK

*NL*
By
this
time
Don
Quixote
had
recovered
from
his
swoon
;
and
in
the
same
*NL*
tone
of
voice
in
which
he
had
called
to
his
squire
the
day
before
when
he
*NL*
lay
stretched
``
in
the
vale
of
the
stakes
,
''
he
began
calling
to
him
now
,
*NL*
``
Sancho
,
my
friend
,
art
thou
asleep
?
sleepest
thou
,
friend
Sancho
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
sleep
,
curses
on
it
!
''
returned
Sancho
discontentedly
and
*NL*
bitterly
,
``
when
it
is
plain
that
all
the
devils
have
been
at
me
this
*NL*
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
mayest
well
believe
that
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
because
,
either
I
*NL*
know
little
,
or
this
castle
is
enchanted
,
for
thou
must
know-but
this
*NL*
that
I
am
now
about
to
tell
thee
thou
must
swear
to
keep
secret
until
*NL*
after
my
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
it
,
''
answered
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
so
,
''
continued
Don
Quixote
,
``
because
I
hate
taking
away
anyone
's
*NL*
good
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
that
I
swear
to
hold
my
tongue
about
it
till
*NL*
the
end
of
your
worship
's
days
,
and
God
grant
I
may
be
able
to
let
it
out
*NL*
tomorrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
do
thee
such
injuries

Sancho

said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
thou
*NL*
wouldst
see
me
dead
so
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
for
that
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
but
because
I
hate
keeping
things
*NL*
long
,
and
I
do
n't
want
them
to
grow
rotten
with
me
from
over-keeping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,

said
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
have
more
confidence
in
thy
affection
*NL*
and
good
nature
;
and
so
I
would
have
thee
know
that
this
night
there
*NL*
befell
me
one
of
the
strangest
adventures
that
I
could
describe
,
and
to
*NL*
relate
it
to
thee
briefly
thou
must
know
that
a
little
while
ago
the
*NL*
daughter
of
the
lord
of
this
castle
came
to
me
,
and
that
she
is
the
most
*NL*
elegant
and
beautiful
damsel
that
could
be
found
in
the
wide
world
.
What
*NL*
I
could
tell
thee
of
the
charms
of
her
person
!
of
her
lively
wit
!
of
*NL*
other
secret
matters
which
,
to
preserve
the
fealty
I
owe
to
my
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
I
shall
pass
over
unnoticed
and
in
silence
!
I
will
*NL*
only
tell
thee
that
,
either
fate
being
envious
of
so
great
a
boon
placed
*NL*
in
my
hands
by
good
fortune
,
or
perhaps
-LRB-
and
this
is
more
probable
-RRB-
this
*NL*
castle
being
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
enchanted
,
at
the
time
when
I
was
*NL*
engaged
in
the
sweetest
and
most
amorous
discourse
with
her
,
there
came
,
*NL*
without
my
seeing
or
knowing
whence
it
came
,
a
hand
attached
to
some
arm
*NL*
of
some
huge
giant
,
that
planted
such
a
cuff
on
my
jaws
that
I
have
them
*NL*
all
bathed
in
blood
,
and
then
pummelled
me
in
such
a
way
that
I
am
in
a
*NL*
worse
plight
than
yesterday
when
the
carriers
,
on
account
of
Rocinante
's
*NL*
misbehaviour
,
inflicted
on
us
the
injury
thou
knowest
of
;
whence
*NL*
conjecture
that
there
must
be
some
enchanted
Moor
guarding
the
treasure
*NL*
of
this
damsel
's
beauty
,
and
that
it
is
not
for
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
me
either
,

said
Sancho
,
``
for
more
than
four
hundred
Moors
have
*NL*
so
thrashed
me
that
the
drubbing
of
the
stakes
was
cakes
and
fancy-bread
*NL*
to
it
.
But
tell
me
,
senor
,
what
do
you
call
this
excellent
and
rare
*NL*
adventure
that
has
left
us
as
we
are
left
now
?
Though
your
worship
was
*NL*
not
so
badly
off
,
having
in
your
arms
that
incomparable
beauty
you
spoke
*NL*
of

but
I
,
what
did
I
have
,
except
the
heaviest
whacks
I
think
I
had
in
*NL*
all
my
life
?
Unlucky
me
and
the
mother
that
bore
me
!
for
I
am
not
a
*NL*
knight-errant
and
never
expect
to
be
one
,
and
of
all
the
mishaps
,
the
*NL*
greater
part
falls
to
my
share

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
thou
hast
been
thrashed
too

Don
Quixote

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
say
so

worse
luck
to
my
line

said
Sancho

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
distressed

said
Don

,
``
for
I
will
now
make

precious
balsam

By
this
time
the
cuadrillero
had
succeeded
in
lighting
the
lamp
,
and
came
*NL*
in
to
see
the
man
that
he
thought
had
been
killed
;
and
as
Sancho
caught
*NL*
sight
of
him
at
the
door
,
seeing
him
coming
in
his
shirt
,
with
a
cloth
on
*NL*
his
head
,
and
a
lamp
in
his
hand
,
and
a
very
forbidding
countenance
,
he
*NL*
said
to
his
master
,
``
Senor
,
can
it
be
that
this
is
the
enchanted
Moor
*NL*
coming
back
to
give
us
more
castigation
if
there
be
anything
still
left
*NL*
in
the
ink-bottle
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
the
Moor

''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
those
under
*NL*
enchantment
do
not
let
themselves
be
seen
by
anyone

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
do
n't
let

be
seen

they

be
felt

said
*NL*
Sancho
;
``
if
not
,
let
my
shoulders
speak
to
the
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
could
speak
too
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
that
is
not
a
sufficient
*NL*
reason
for
believing
that
what
we
see
is
the
enchanted
Moor

*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
came
up
,
and
finding
them
engaged
in
such
a
peaceful
*NL*
conversation
,
stood
amazed
;
though
Don
Quixote
,
to
be
sure
,
still
lay
on
*NL*
his
back
unable
to
move
from
pure
pummelling
and
plasters
.
The
officer
*NL*
turned
to
him
and
said
,
``
Well
,
how
goes
it
,
good
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
speak
more
politely
if
I
were
you

replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
is
it
*NL*
the
way
of
this
country
to
address
knights-errant
in
that
style

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cuadrillero
finding
himself
so
disrespectfully
treated
by
such
a
*NL*
sorry-looking
individual
,
lost
his
temper
,
and
raising
the
lamp
full
of
*NL*
oil
,
smote
Don
Quixote
such
a
blow
with
it
on
the
head
that
he
gave
him
a
*NL*
badly
broken
pate
;
then
,
all
being
in
darkness
,
he
went
out
,
and
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
said
,
``
That
is
certainly
the
enchanted
Moor

Don
Quixote
,
``
and
there
is
no
use
in
*NL*
troubling
oneself
about
these
matters
of
enchantment
or
being
angry
or
*NL*
vexed
at
them
,
for
as
they
are
invisible
and
visionary
we
shall
find
no
*NL*
one
on
whom
to
avenge
ourselves
,
do
what
we
may
;
rise
,
Sancho
,
if
thou
*NL*
canst
,
and
call
the
alcaide
of
this
fortress
,
and
get
him
to
give
me
a
*NL*
little
oil
,
wine
,
salt
,
and
rosemary
to
make
the
salutiferous
balsam
,
for
*NL*
indeed
I
believe
I
have
great
need
of
it
now
,
because
I
am
losing
much
*NL*
blood
from
the
wound
that
phantom
gave
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
got
up
with
pain
enough
in
his
bones
,
and
went
after
the
innkeeper
*NL*
in
the
dark
,
and
meeting
the
officer
,
who
was
looking
to
see
what
had
*NL*
become
of
his
enemy
,
he
said
to
him
,
``
Senor
,
whoever
you
are
,
do
us
the
*NL*
favour
and
kindness
to
give
us
a
little
rosemary
,
oil
,
salt
,
and
wine
,
*NL*
for
it
is
wanted
to
cure
one
of
the
best
knights-errant
on
earth
,
who
*NL*
lies
on
yonder
bed
wounded
by
the
hands
of
the
enchanted
Moor
that
is
in
*NL*
this
inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
officer
heard
him
talk
in
this
way
,
he
took
him
for
a
man
out
of
*NL*
his
senses
,
and
as
day
was
now
beginning
to
break
,
he
opened
the
inn
*NL*
gate
,
and
calling
the
host
,
he
told
him
what
this
good
man
wanted
.
The
*NL*
host
furnished
him
with
what
he
required
,
and
Sancho
brought
it
to
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
,
with
his
hand
to
his
head
,
was
bewailing
the
pain
of
the
*NL*
blow
of
the
lamp
,
which
had
done
him
no
more
harm
than
raising
a
couple
*NL*
of
rather
large
lumps
,
and
what
he
fancied
blood
was
only
the
sweat
that
*NL*
flowed
from
him
in
his
sufferings
during
the
late
storm
.
To
be
brief
,
he
*NL*
took
the
materials
,
of
which
he
made
a
compound
,
mixing
them
all
and
*NL*
boiling
them
a
good
while
until
it
seemed
to
him
they
had
come
to
*NL*
perfection
.
He
then
asked
for
some
vial
to
pour
it
into
,
and
as
there
was
*NL*
not
one
in
the
inn
,
he
decided
on
putting
it
into
a
tin
oil-bottle
or
*NL*
flask
of
which
the
host
made
him
a
free
gift
;
and
over
the
flask
he
*NL*
repeated
more
than
eighty
paternosters
and
as
many
more
ave-marias
,
*NL*
salves
,
and
credos
,
accompanying
each
word
with
a
cross
by
way
of
*NL*
benediction
,
at
all
which
there
were
present
Sancho
,
the
innkeeper
,
and
*NL*
the
cuadrillero
;
for
the
carrier
was
now
peacefully
engaged
in
attending
*NL*
to
the
comfort
of
his
mules
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
being
accomplished
,
he
felt
anxious
to
make
trial
himself
,
on
the
*NL*
spot
,
of
the
virtue
of
this
precious
balsam
,
as
he
considered
it
,
and
so
*NL*
he
drank
near
a
quart
of
what
could
not
be
put
into
the
flask
and
*NL*
remained
in
the
pigskin
in
which
it
had
been
boiled
;
but
scarcely
had
he
*NL*
done
drinking
when
he
began
to
vomit
in
such
a
way
that
nothing
was
left
*NL*
in
his
stomach
,
and
with
the
pangs
and
spasms
of
vomiting
he
broke
into
a
*NL*
profuse
sweat
,
on
account
of
which
he
bade
them
cover
him
up
and
leave
*NL*
him
alone
.
They
did
so
,
and
he
lay
sleeping
more
than
three
hours
,
at
the
*NL*
end
of
which
he
awoke
and
felt
very
great
bodily
relief
and
so
much
ease
*NL*
from
his
bruises
that
he
thought
himself
quite
cured
,
and
verily
believed
*NL*
he
had
hit
upon
the
balsam
of
Fierabras
;
and
that
with
this
remedy
he
*NL*
might
thenceforward
,
without
any
fear
,
face
any
kind
of
destruction
,
*NL*
battle
,
or
combat
,
however
perilous
it
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
,
who
also
regarded
the
amendment
of
his
master
as
*NL*
miraculous
,
begged
him
to
give
him
what
was
left
in
the
pigskin
,
which
*NL*
was
no
small
quantity
.
Don
Quixote
consented
,
and
he
,
taking
it
with
both
*NL*
hands
,
in
good
faith
and
with
a
better
will
,
gulped
down
and
drained
off
*NL*
very
little
less
than
his
master
.
But
the
fact
is
,
that
the
stomach
of
*NL*
poor
Sancho
was
of
necessity
not
so
delicate
as
that
of
his
master
,
and
*NL*
so
,
before
vomiting
,
he
was
seized
with
such
gripings
and
retchings
,
and
*NL*
such
sweats
and
faintness
,
that
verily
and
truly
he
believed
his
last
*NL*
hour
had
come
,
and
finding
himself
so
racked
and
tormented
he
cursed
the
*NL*
balsam
and
the
thief
that
had
given
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
seeing
him
in
this
state
said
,
``
It
is
my
belief
,
Sancho
,
that
*NL*
this
mischief
comes
of
thy
not
being
dubbed
a
knight
,
for
I
am
persuaded
*NL*
this
liquor
can
not
be
good
for
those
who
are
not
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
worship
knew
that
,
''
returned
Sancho
--
``
woe
betide
me
and
all
my
*NL*
kindred
!
--
why
did
you
let
me
taste
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
draught
took
effect
,
and
the
poor
squire
began
to
*NL*
discharge
both
ways
at
such
a
rate
that
the
rush
mat
on
which
he
had
*NL*
thrown
himself
and
the
canvas
blanket
he
had
covering
him
were
fit
for
*NL*
nothing
afterwards
.
He
sweated
and
perspired
with
such
paroxysms
and
*NL*
convulsions
that
not
only
he
himself
but
all
present
thought
his
end
had
*NL*
come
.
This
tempest
and
tribulation
lasted
about
two
hours
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
which
he
was
left
,
not
like
his
master
,
but
so
weak
and
exhausted
that
he
*NL*
could
not
stand
.
Don
Quixote
,
however
,
who
,
as
has
been
said
,
felt
*NL*
himself
relieved
and
well
,
was
eager
to
take
his
departure
at
once
in
*NL*
quest
of
adventures
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
the
time
he
loitered
*NL*
there
was
a
fraud
upon
the
world
and
those
in
it
who
stood
in
need
of
his
*NL*
help
and
protection
,
all
the
more
when
he
had
the
security
and
confidence
*NL*
his
balsam
afforded
him
;
and
so
,
urged
by
this
impulse
,
he
saddled
*NL*
Rocinante
himself
and
put
the
pack-saddle
on
his
squire
's
beast
,
whom
*NL*
likewise
he
helped
to
dress
and
mount
the
ass
;
after
which
he
mounted
his
*NL*
horse
and
turning
to
a
corner
of
the
inn
he
laid
hold
of
a
pike
that
*NL*
stood
there
,
to
serve
him
by
way
of
a
lance
.
All
that
were
in
the
inn
,
*NL*
who
were
more
than
twenty
persons
,
stood
watching
him
;
the
innkeeper
's
*NL*
daughter
was
likewise
observing
him
,
and
he
too
never
took
his
eyes
off
*NL*
her
,
and
from
time
to
time
fetched
a
sigh
that
he
seemed
to
pluck
up
from
*NL*
the
depths
of
his
bowels
;
but
they
all
thought
it
must
be
from
the
pain
*NL*
he
felt
in
his
ribs
;
at
any
rate
they
who
had
seen
him
plastered
the
*NL*
night
before
thought
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
were
both
mounted
,
at
the
gate
of
the
inn
,
he
called
to
*NL*
the
host
and
said
in
a
very
grave
and
measured
voice
,
``
Many
and
great
are
*NL*
the
favours
,
Senor
Alcaide
,
that
I
have
received
in
this
castle
of
yours
,
*NL*
and
I
remain
under
the
deepest
obligation
to
be
grateful
to
you
for
them
*NL*
all
the
days
of
my
life
;
if
I
can
repay
them
in
avenging
you
of
any
*NL*
arrogant
foe
who
may
have
wronged
you
,
know
that
my
calling
is
no
other
*NL*
than
to
aid
the
weak
,
to
avenge
those
who
suffer
wrong
,
and
to
chastise
*NL*
perfidy
.
Search
your
memory
,
and
if
you
find
anything
of
this
kind
you
*NL*
need
only
tell
me
of
it
,
and
I
promise
you
by
the
order
of
knighthood
*NL*
which
I
have
received
to
procure
you
satisfaction
and
reparation
to
the
*NL*
utmost
of
your
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
innkeeper
replied
to
him
with
equal
calmness
,
``
Sir
Knight
,
I
do
not
*NL*
want
your
worship
to
avenge
me
of
any
wrong
,
because
when
any
is
done
me
*NL*
I
can
take
what
vengeance
seems
good
to
me
;
the
only
thing
I
want
is
that
*NL*
you
pay
me
the
score
that
you
have
run
up
in
the
inn
last
night
,
as
well
*NL*
for
the
straw
and
barley
for
your
two
beasts
,
as
for
supper
and
beds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
this
is
an
inn
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
very
respectable
one
,
''
said
the
innkeeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
under
a
mistake
all
this
time
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
*NL*
in
truth
I
thought
it
was
a
castle
,
and
not
a
bad
one
;
but
since
it
*NL*
appears
that
it
is
not
a
castle
but
an
inn
,
all
that
can
be
done
now
is
*NL*
that
you
should
excuse
the
payment
,
for
I
can
not
contravene
the
rule
of
*NL*
knights-errant
,
of
whom
I
know
as
a
fact
-LRB-
and
up
to
the
present
I
have
*NL*
read
nothing
to
the
contrary
-RRB-
that
they
never
paid
for
lodging
or
*NL*
anything
else
in
the
inn
where
they
might
be
;
for
any
hospitality
that
*NL*
might
be
offered
them
is
their
due
by
law
and
right
in
return
for
the
*NL*
insufferable
toil
they
endure
in
seeking
adventures
by
night
and
by
day
,
*NL*
in
summer
and
in
winter
,
on
foot
and
on
horseback
,
in
hunger
and
thirst
,
*NL*
cold
and
heat
,
exposed
to
all
the
inclemencies
of
heaven
and
all
the
*NL*
hardships
of
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
little
to
do
with
that
,
''
replied
the
innkeeper
;
``
pay
me
what
you
*NL*
owe
me
,
and
let
us
have
no
more
talk
of
chivalry
,
for
all
I
care
about
is
*NL*
to
get
my
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
stupid
,
scurvy
innkeeper
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
and
putting
spurs
*NL*
to
Rocinante
and
bringing
his
pike
to
the
slope
he
rode
out
of
the
inn
*NL*
before
anyone
could
stop
him
,
and
pushed
on
some
distance
without
looking
*NL*
to
see
if
his
squire
was
following
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
innkeeper
when
he
saw
him
go
without
paying
him
ran
to
get
payment
of
*NL*
Sancho
,
who
said
that
as
his
master
would
not
pay
neither
would
he
,
*NL*
because
,
being
as
he
was
squire
to
a
knight-errant
,
the
same
rule
and
*NL*
reason
held
good
for
him
as
for
his
master
with
regard
to
not
paying
*NL*
anything
in
inns
and
hostelries
.
At
this
the
innkeeper
waxed
very
wroth
,
*NL*
and
threatened
if
he
did
not
pay
to
compel
him
in
a
way
that
he
would
not
*NL*
like
.
To
which
Sancho
made
answer
that
by
the
law
of
chivalry
his
master
*NL*
had
received
he
would
not
pay
a
rap
,
though
it
cost
him
his
life
;
for
the
*NL*
excellent
and
ancient
usage
of
knights-errant
was
not
going
to
be
*NL*
violated
by
him
,
nor
should
the
squires
of
such
as
were
yet
to
come
into
*NL*
the
world
ever
complain
of
him
or
reproach
him
with
breaking
so
just
a
*NL*
privilege
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ill-luck
of
the
unfortunate
Sancho
so
ordered
it
that
among
the
*NL*
company
in
the
inn
there
were
four
woolcarders
from
Segovia
,
three
*NL*
needle-makers
from
the
Colt
of
Cordova
,
and
two
lodgers
from
the
Fair
of
*NL*
Seville
,
lively
fellows
,
tender-hearted
,
fond
of
a
joke
,
and
playful
,
*NL*
who
,
almost
as
if
instigated
and
moved
by
a
common
impulse
,
made
up
to
*NL*
Sancho
and
dismounted
him
from
his
ass
,
while
one
of
them
went
in
for
the
*NL*
blanket
of
the
host
's
bed
;
but
on
flinging
him
into
it
they
looked
up
,
*NL*
and
seeing
that
the
ceiling
was
somewhat
lower
than
what
they
required
for
*NL*
their
work
,
they
decided
upon
going
out
into
the
yard
,
which
was
bounded
*NL*
by
the
sky
,
and
there
,
putting
Sancho
in
the
middle
of
the
blanket
,
they
*NL*
began
to
raise
him
high
,
making
sport
with
him
as
they
would
with
a
dog
*NL*
at
Shrovetide
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cries
of
the
poor
blanketed
wretch
were
so
loud
that
they
reached
the
*NL*
ears
of
his
master
,
who
,
halting
to
listen
attentively
,
was
persuaded
*NL*
that
some
new
adventure
was
coming
,
until
he
clearly
perceived
that
it
*NL*
was
his
squire
who
uttered
them
.
Wheeling
about
he
came
up
to
the
inn
*NL*
with
a
laborious
gallop
,
and
finding
it
shut
went
round
it
to
see
if
he
*NL*
could
find
some
way
of
getting
in
;
but
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
wall
of
*NL*
the
yard
,
which
was
not
very
high
,
he
discovered
the
game
that
was
being
*NL*
played
with
his
squire
.
He
saw
him
rising
and
falling
in
the
air
with
*NL*
such
grace
and
nimbleness
that
,
had
his
rage
allowed
him
,
it
is
my
belief
*NL*
he
would
have
laughed
.
He
tried
to
climb
from
his
horse
on
to
the
top
of
*NL*
the
wall
,
but
he
was
so
bruised
and
battered
that
he
could
not
even
*NL*
dismount
;
and
so
from
the
back
of
his
horse
he
began
to
utter
such
*NL*
maledictions
and
objurgations
against
those
who
were
blanketing
Sancho
as
*NL*
it
would
be
impossible
to
write
down
accurately
:
they
,
however
,
did
not
*NL*
stay
their
laughter
or
their
work
for
this
,
nor
did
the
flying
Sancho
*NL*
cease
his
lamentations
,
mingled
now
with
threats
,
now
with
entreaties
but
*NL*
all
to
little
purpose
,
or
none
at
all
,
until
from
pure
weariness
they
*NL*
left
off
.
They
then
brought
him
his
ass
,
and
mounting
him
on
top
of
it
*NL*
they
put
his
jacket
round
him
;
and
the
compassionate
Maritornes
,
seeing
*NL*
him
so
exhausted
,
thought
fit
to
refresh
him
with
a
jug
of
water
,
and
*NL*
that
it
might
be
all
the
cooler
she
fetched
it
from
the
well
.
Sancho
took
*NL*
it
,
and
as
he
was
raising
it
to
his
mouth
he
was
stopped
by
the
cries
of
*NL*
his
master
exclaiming
,
``
Sancho
,
my
son
,
drink
not
water
;
drink
it
not
,
my
*NL*
son
,
for
it
will
kill
thee
;
see
,
here
I
have
the
blessed
balsam
-LRB-
and
he
*NL*
held
up
the
flask
of
liquor
-RRB-
,
and
with
drinking
two
drops
of
it
thou
wilt
*NL*
certainly
be
restored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
Sancho
turned
his
eyes
asquint
,
and
in
a
still
louder
*NL*
voice
said
,
``
Can
it
be
your
worship
has
forgotten
that
I
am
not
a
knight
,
*NL*
or
do
you
want
me
to
end
by
vomiting
up
what
bowels
I
have
left
after
*NL*
last
night
?
Keep
your
liquor
in
the
name
of
all
the
devils
,
and
leave
me
*NL*
to
myself
!
''
and
at
one
and
the
same
instant
he
left
off
talking
and
began
*NL*
drinking
;
but
as
at
the
first
sup
he
perceived
it
was
water
he
did
not
*NL*
care
to
go
on
with
it
,
and
begged
Maritornes
to
fetch
him
some
wine
,
*NL*
which
she
did
with
right
good
will
,
and
paid
for
it
with
her
own
money
;
*NL*
for
indeed
they
say
of
her
that
,
though
she
was
in
that
line
of
life
,
*NL*
there
was
some
faint
and
distant
resemblance
to
a
Christian
about
her
.
*NL*
When
Sancho
had
done
drinking
he
dug
his
heels
into
his
ass
,
and
the
gate
*NL*
of
the
inn
being
thrown
open
he
passed
out
very
well
pleased
at
having
*NL*
paid
nothing
and
carried
his
point
,
though
it
had
been
at
the
expense
of
*NL*
his
usual
sureties
,
his
shoulders
.
It
is
true
that
the
innkeeper
detained
*NL*
his
alforjas
in
payment
of
what
was
owing
to
him
,
but
Sancho
took
his
*NL*
departure
in
such
a
flurry
that
he
never
missed
them
.
The
innkeeper
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
saw
him
off
,
wanted
to
bar
the
gate
close
,
but
the
blanketers
*NL*
would
not
agree
to
it
,
for
they
were
fellows
who
would
not
have
cared
two
*NL*
farthings
for
Don
Quixote
,
even
had
he
been
really
one
of
the
*NL*
knights-errant
of
the
Round
Table

CHAPTER
XVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
IS
RELATED
THE
DISCOURSE
SANCHO
PANZA
HELD
WITH
HIS
MASTER
,
DON
*NL*
QUIXOTE
,
AND
OTHER
ADVENTURES
WORTH
RELATING
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
reached
his
master
so
limp
and
faint
that
he
could
not
urge
on
his
*NL*
beast
.
When
Don
Quixote
saw
the
state
he
was
in
he
said
,
``
I
have
now
come
*NL*
to
the
conclusion
,
good
Sancho
,
that
this
castle
or
inn
is
beyond
a
doubt
*NL*
enchanted
,
because
those
who
have
so
atrociously
diverted
themselves
with
*NL*
thee
,
what
can
they
be
but
phantoms
or
beings
of
another
world
?
and
I
*NL*
hold
this
confirmed
by
having
noticed
that
when
I
was
by
the
wall
of
the
*NL*
yard
witnessing
the
acts
of
thy
sad
tragedy
,
it
was
out
of
my
power
to
*NL*
mount
upon
it
,
nor
could
I
even
dismount
from
Rocinante
,
because
they
no
*NL*
doubt
had
me
enchanted
;
for
I
swear
to
thee
by
the
faith
of
what
I
am
*NL*
that
if
I
had
been
able
to
climb
up
or
dismount
,
I
would
have
avenged
*NL*
thee
in
such
a
way
that
those
braggart
thieves
would
have
remembered
*NL*
their
freak
for
ever
,
even
though
in
so
doing
I
knew
that
I
contravened
*NL*
the
laws
of
chivalry
,
which
,
as
I
have
often
told
thee
,
do
not
permit
a
*NL*
knight
to
lay
hands
on
him
who
is
not
one
,
save
in
case
of
urgent
and
*NL*
great
necessity
in
defence
of
his
own
life
and
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
have
avenged
myself
too
if
I
could
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
whether
I
had
*NL*
been
dubbed
knight
or
not
,
but
I
could
not
;
though
for
my
part
I
am
*NL*
persuaded
those
who
amused
themselves
with
me
were
not
phantoms
or
*NL*
enchanted
men
,
as
your
worship
says
,
but
men
of
flesh
and
bone
like
*NL*
ourselves
;
and
they
all
had
their
names
,
for
I
heard
them
name
them
when
*NL*
they
were
tossing
me
,
and
one
was
called
Pedro
Martinez
,
and
another
*NL*
Tenorio
Hernandez
,
and
the
innkeeper
,
I
heard
,
was
called
Juan
Palomeque
*NL*
the
Left-handed
;
so
that
,
senor
,
your
not
being
able
to
leap
over
the
*NL*
wall
of
the
yard
or
dismount
from
your
horse
came
of
something
else
*NL*
besides
enchantments
;
and
what
I
make
out
clearly
from
all
this
is
,
that
*NL*
these
adventures
we
go
seeking
will
in
the
end
lead
us
into
such
*NL*
misadventures
that
we
shall
not
know
which
is
our
right
foot
;
and
that
*NL*
the
best
and
wisest
thing
,
according
to
my
small
wits
,
would
be
for
us
to
*NL*
return
home
,
now
that
it
is
harvest-time
,
and
attend
to
our
business
,
and
*NL*
give
over
wandering
from
Zeca
to
Mecca
and
from
pail
to
bucket
,
as
the
*NL*
saying
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
little
thou
knowest
about
chivalry
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
``
hold
thy
peace
and
have
patience
;
the
day
will
come
when
thou
shalt
see
*NL*
with
thine
own
eyes
what
an
honourable
thing
it
is
to
wander
in
the
*NL*
pursuit
of
this
calling
;
nay
,
tell
me
,
what
greater
pleasure
can
there
be
*NL*
in
the
world
,
or
what
delight
can
equal
that
of
winning
a
battle
,
and
*NL*
triumphing
over
one
's
enemy
?
None
,
beyond
all
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
though
I
do
not
know
it
;
all
I
know
is
*NL*
that
since
we
have
been
knights-errant
,
or
since
your
worship
has
been
*NL*
one
-LRB-
for
I
have
no
right
to
reckon
myself
one
of
so
honourable
a
number
-RRB-
*NL*
we
have
never
won
any
battle
except
the
one
with
the
Biscayan
,
and
even
*NL*
out
of
that
your
worship
came
with
half
an
ear
and
half
a
helmet
the
*NL*
less
;
and
from
that
till
now
it
has
been
all
cudgellings
and
more
*NL*
cudgellings
,
cuffs
and
more
cuffs
,
I
getting
the
blanketing
over
and
*NL*
above
,
and
falling
in
with
enchanted
persons
on
whom
I
can
not
avenge
*NL*
myself
so
as
to
know
what
the
delight
,
as
your
worship
calls
it
,
of
*NL*
conquering
an
enemy
is
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
vexes
me
,
and
what
ought
to
vex
thee
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
``
but
henceforward
I
will
endeavour
to
have
at
hand
some
sword
*NL*
made
by
such
craft
that
no
kind
of
enchantments
can
take
effect
upon
him
*NL*
who
carries
it
,
and
it
is
even
possible
that
fortune
may
procure
for
me
*NL*
that
which
belonged
to
Amadis
when
he
was
called
`
The
Knight
of
the
*NL*
Burning
Sword
,
'
which
was
one
of
the
best
swords
that
ever
knight
in
the
*NL*
world
possessed
,
for
,
besides
having
the
said
virtue
,
it
cut
like
a
*NL*
razor
,
and
there
was
no
armour
,
however
strong
and
enchanted
it
might
be
,
*NL*
that
could
resist
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
is
my
luck
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
even
if
that
happened
and
your
*NL*
worship
found
some
such
sword
,
it
would
,
like
the
balsam
,
turn
out
*NL*
serviceable
and
good
for
dubbed
knights
only
,
and
as
for
the
squires
,
*NL*
they
might
sup
sorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fear
not
that
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
:
``
Heaven
will
deal
better
by
*NL*
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
talking
,
Don
Quixote
and
his
squire
were
going
along
,
when
,
on
the
*NL*
road
they
were
following
,
Don
Quixote
perceived
approaching
them
a
large
*NL*
and
thick
cloud
of
dust
,
on
seeing
which
he
turned
to
Sancho
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
day
,
Sancho
,
on
which
will
be
seen
the
boon
my
fortune
is
*NL*
reserving
for
me
;
this
,
I
say
,
is
the
day
on
which
as
much
as
on
any
*NL*
other
shall
be
displayed
the
might
of
my
arm
,
and
on
which
I
shall
do
*NL*
deeds
that
shall
remain
written
in
the
book
of
fame
for
all
ages
to
come
.
*NL*
Seest
thou
that
cloud
of
dust
which
rises
yonder
?
Well
,
then
,
all
that
is
*NL*
churned
up
by
a
vast
army
composed
of
various
and
countless
nations
that
*NL*
comes
marching
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
According
to
that
there
must
be
two
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
on
this
opposite
*NL*
side
also
there
rises
just
such
another
cloud
of
dust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
turned
to
look
and
found
that
it
was
true
,
and
rejoicing
*NL*
exceedingly
,
he
concluded
that
they
were
two
armies
about
to
engage
and
*NL*
encounter
in
the
midst
of
that
broad
plain
;
for
at
all
times
and
seasons
*NL*
his
fancy
was
full
of
the
battles
,
enchantments
,
adventures
,
crazy
feats
,
*NL*
loves
,
and
defiances
that
are
recorded
in
the
books
of
chivalry
,
and
*NL*
everything
he
said
,
thought
,
or
did
had
reference
to
such
things
.
Now
the
*NL*
cloud
of
dust
he
had
seen
was
raised
by
two
great
droves
of
sheep
coming
*NL*
along
the
same
road
in
opposite
directions
,
which
,
because
of
the
dust
,
*NL*
did
not
become
visible
until
they
drew
near
,
but
Don
Quixote
asserted
so
*NL*
positively
that
they
were
armies
that
Sancho
was
led
to
believe
it
and
*NL*
say
,
``
Well
,
and
what
are
we
to
do
,
senor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
:
``
give
aid
and
assistance
to
the
weak
and
those
*NL*
who
need
it
;
and
thou
must
know
,
Sancho
,
that
this
which
comes
opposite
*NL*
to
us
is
conducted
and
led
by
the
mighty
emperor
Alifanfaron
,
lord
of
the
*NL*
great
isle
of
Trapobana
;
this
other
that
marches
behind
me
is
that
of
his
*NL*
enemy
the
king
of
the
Garamantas
,
Pentapolin
of
the
Bare
Arm
,
for
he
*NL*
always
goes
into
battle
with
his
right
arm
bare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
these
two
lords
such
enemies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
at
enmity
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
because
this
Alifanfaron
is
a
*NL*
furious
pagan
and
is
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
Pentapolin
,
who
is
a
*NL*
very
beautiful
and
moreover
gracious
lady
,
and
a
Christian
,
and
her
*NL*
father
is
unwilling
to
bestow
her
upon
the
pagan
king
unless
he
first
*NL*
abandons
the
religion
of
his
false
prophet
Mahomet
,
and
adopts
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
beard
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
Pentapolin
does
quite
right
,
and
I
will
*NL*
help
him
as
much
as
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
thou
wilt
do
what
is
thy
duty
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
*NL*
to
engage
in
battles
of
this
sort
it
is
not
requisite
to
be
a
dubbed
*NL*
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
well
understand
,
''
answered
Sancho
;
``
but
where
shall
we
put
*NL*
this
ass
where
we
may
be
sure
to
find
him
after
the
fray
is
over
?
for
I
*NL*
believe
it
has
not
been
the
custom
so
far
to
go
into
battle
on
a
beast
of
*NL*
this
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
what
you
had
best
do
with
him
is
*NL*
to
leave
him
to
take
his
chance
whether
he
be
lost
or
not
,
for
the
horses
*NL*
we
shall
have
when
we
come
out
victors
will
be
so
many
that
even
*NL*
Rocinante
will
run
a
risk
of
being
changed
for
another
.
But
attend
to
me
*NL*
and
observe
,
for
I
wish
to
give
thee
some
account
of
the
chief
knights
*NL*
who
accompany
these
two
armies
;
and
that
thou
mayest
the
better
see
and
*NL*
mark
,
let
us
withdraw
to
that
hillock
which
rises
yonder
,
whence
both
*NL*
armies
may
be
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
so
,
and
placed
themselves
on
a
rising
ground
from
which
the
two
*NL*
droves
that
Don
Quixote
made
armies
of
might
have
been
plainly
seen
if
*NL*
the
clouds
of
dust
they
raised
had
not
obscured
them
and
blinded
the
*NL*
sight
;
nevertheless
,
seeing
in
his
imagination
what
he
did
not
see
and
*NL*
what
did
not
exist
,
he
began
thus
in
a
loud
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
knight
whom
thou
seest
yonder
in
yellow
armour
,
who
bears
upon
his
*NL*
shield
a
lion
crowned
crouching
at
the
feet
of
a
damsel
,
is
the
valiant
*NL*
Laurcalco
,
lord
of
the
Silver
Bridge
;
that
one
in
armour
with
flowers
of
*NL*
gold
,
who
bears
on
his
shield
three
crowns
argent
on
an
azure
field
,
is
*NL*
the
dreaded
Micocolembo
,
grand
duke
of
Quirocia
;
that
other
of
gigantic
*NL*
frame
,
on
his
right
hand
,
is
the
ever
dauntless
Brandabarbaran
de
*NL*
Boliche
,
lord
of
the
three
Arabias
,
who
for
armour
wears
that
serpent
*NL*
skin
,
and
has
for
shield
a
gate
which
,
according
to
tradition
,
is
one
of
*NL*
those
of
the
temple
that
Samson
brought
to
the
ground
when
by
his
death
*NL*
he
revenged
himself
upon
his
enemies
.
But
turn
thine
eyes
to
the
other
*NL*
side
,
and
thou
shalt
see
in
front
and
in
the
van
of
this
other
army
the
*NL*
ever
victorious
and
never
vanquished
Timonel
of
Carcajona
,
prince
of
New
*NL*
Biscay
,
who
comes
in
armour
with
arms
quartered
azure
,
vert
,
white
,
and
*NL*
yellow
,
and
bears
on
his
shield
a
cat
or
on
a
field
tawny
with
a
motto
*NL*
which
says
Miau
,
which
is
the
beginning
of
the
name
of
his
lady
,
who
*NL*
according
to
report
is
the
peerless
Miaulina
,
daughter
of
the
duke
*NL*
Alfeniquen
of
the
Algarve
;
the
other
,
who
burdens
and
presses
the
loins
*NL*
of
that
powerful
charger
and
bears
arms
white
as
snow
and
a
shield
blank
*NL*
and
without
any
device
,
is
a
novice
knight
,
a
Frenchman
by
birth
,
Pierres
*NL*
Papin
by
name
,
lord
of
the
baronies
of
Utrique
;
that

who
with

iron-shod
heels
strikes
the
flanks
of
that
nimble
parti-coloured
zebra
,
*NL*
and
for
arms
bears
azure
vair

is
the
mighty
duke
of
Nerbia
,
*NL*
Espartafilardo

Bosque
,
who
bears
for

on
his
shield
an
*NL*
asparagus
plant
with
a
motto
in
Castilian
that
says
,
Rastrea
mi
suerte
.
''
*NL*
And
so
he
went
on
naming
a
number
of
knights
of
one
squadron
or
the
other
*NL*
out
of
his
imagination
,
and
to
all
he
assigned
off-hand
their
arms
,
*NL*
colours
,
devices
,
and
mottoes
,
carried
away
by
the
illusions
of
his
*NL*
unheard-of
craze
;
and
without
a
pause
,
he
continued
,
``
People
of
divers
*NL*
nations
compose
this
squadron
in

;
here
are
those
that
drink
of
the
*NL*
sweet
waters
of
the
famous
Xanthus
,
those
that
scour
the
woody
Massilian
*NL*
plains
,
those
that
sift
the
pure
fine
gold
of
Arabia
Felix
,
those
that
*NL*
enjoy
the
famed
cool
banks
of
the
crystal
Thermodon
,
those
that
in
many
*NL*
and
various

divert
the
streams
of
the
golden
Pactolus
,
the
*NL*
Numidians
,
faithless
in
their
promises
,
the
Persians
renowned
in
archery
,
*NL*
the
Parthians
and
the
Medes
that
fight
as
they
fly
,
the
Arabs
that
ever
*NL*
shift
their
dwellings
,
the
Scythians
as
cruel
as
they
are
fair
,
the
*NL*
Ethiopians
with
pierced
lips
,
and
an
infinity
of
other
nations
whose
*NL*
features
I
recognise
and
descry
,
though
I
can
not
recall
their
names
.
In
*NL*
this
other
squadron
there
come
those
that
drink
of
the
crystal
streams
of
*NL*
the
olive-bearing
Betis
,
those
that
make
smooth
their
countenances
with
*NL*
the
water
of
the
ever
rich
and
golden
Tagus
,
those
that
rejoice
in
the
*NL*
fertilising
flow
of
the
divine
Genil
,
those
that
roam
the
Tartesian
*NL*
plains
abounding
in
pasture
,
those
that
take
their
pleasure
in
the
*NL*
Elysian
meadows
of
Jerez
,
the
rich
Manchegans
crowned
with
ruddy
ears
of
*NL*
corn
,
the
wearers
of
iron
,
old
relics
of
the
Gothic
race
,
those
that
*NL*
bathe
in
the
Pisuerga
renowned
for
its
gentle
current
,
those
that
feed
*NL*
their
herds
along
the
spreading
pastures
of
the
winding
Guadiana
famed
*NL*
for
its
hidden
course
,
those
that
tremble
with
the
cold
of
the
pineclad
*NL*
Pyrenees
or
the
dazzling
snows
of
the
lofty
Apennine
;
in
a
word
,
as
many
*NL*
as
all
Europe
includes
and
contains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Good
God
!
what
a
number
of
countries
and
nations
he
named
!
giving
to
each
*NL*
its
proper
attributes
with
marvellous
readiness
;
brimful
and
saturated
*NL*
with
what
he
had
read
in
his
lying
books
!
Sancho
Panza
hung
upon
his
*NL*
words
without
speaking
,
and
from
time
to
time
turned
to
try
if
he
could
*NL*
see
the
knights
and
giants
his
master
was
describing
,
and
as
he
could
not
*NL*
make
out
one
of
them
he
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
devil
take
it
if
there
's
a
sign
of
any
man
you
talk
of
,
knight
or
*NL*
giant
,
in
the
whole
thing
;
maybe
it
's
all
enchantment
,
like
the
phantoms
*NL*
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
canst
thou
say
that
!
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
``
dost
thou
not
hear
the
*NL*
neighing
of
the
steeds
,
the
braying
of
the
trumpets
,
the
roll
of
the
*NL*
drums
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
nothing
but
a
great
bleating
of
ewes
and
sheep
,
''
said
Sancho
;
*NL*
which
was
true
,
for
by
this
time
the
two
flocks
had
come
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fear
thou
art
in
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
prevents
thee
from
*NL*
seeing
or
hearing
correctly
,
for
one
of
the
effects
of
fear
is
to
derange
*NL*
the
senses
and
make
things
appear
different
from
what
they
are
;
if
thou
*NL*
art
in
such
fear
,
withdraw
to
one
side
and
leave
me
to
myself
,
for
alone
*NL*
I
suffice
to
bring
victory
to
that
side
to
which
I
shall
give
my
aid
;
''
*NL*
and
so
saying
he
gave
Rocinante
the
spur
,
and
putting
the
lance
in
rest
,
*NL*
shot
down
the
slope
like
a
thunderbolt
.
Sancho
shouted
after
him
,
crying
,
*NL*
``
Come
back
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
;
I
vow
to
God
they
are
sheep
and
ewes
you
*NL*
are
charging
!
Come
back
!
Unlucky
the
father
that
begot
me
!
what
madness
*NL*
is
this
!
Look
,
there
is
no
giant
,
nor
knight
,
nor
cats
,
nor
arms
,
nor
*NL*
shields
quartered
or
whole
,
nor
vair
azure
or
bedevilled
.
What
are
you
*NL*
about
?
Sinner
that
I
am
before
God
!
''
But
not
for
all
these
entreaties
did
*NL*
Don
Quixote
turn
back
;
on
the
contrary
he
went
on
shouting
out
,
``
Ho
,
*NL*
knights
,
ye
who
follow
and
fight
under
the
banners
of
the
valiant
emperor
*NL*
Pentapolin
of
the
Bare
Arm
,
follow
me
all
;
ye
shall
see
how
easily
I
*NL*
shall
give
him
his
revenge
over
his
enemy
Alifanfaron
of
the
Trapobana
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
dashed
into
the
midst
of
the
squadron
of
ewes
,
and
began
*NL*
spearing
them
with
as
much
spirit
and
intrepidity
as
if
he
were
*NL*
transfixing
mortal
enemies
in
earnest
.
The
shepherds
and
drovers
*NL*
accompanying
the
flock
shouted
to
him
to
desist
;
seeing
it
was
no
use
,
*NL*
they
ungirt
their
slings
and
began
to
salute
his
ears
with
stones
as
big
*NL*
as
one
's
fist
.
Don
Quixote
gave
no
heed
to
the
stones
,
but
,
letting
drive
*NL*
right
and
left
kept
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
art
thou
,
proud
Alifanfaron
?
Come
before
me
;
I
am
a
single
knight
*NL*
who
would
fain
prove
thy
prowess
hand
to
hand
,
and
make
thee
yield
thy
*NL*
life
a
penalty
for
the
wrong
thou
dost
to
the
valiant
Pentapolin
*NL*
Garamanta
.
''
Here
came
a
sugar-plum
from
the
brook
that
struck
him
on
the
*NL*
side
and
buried
a
couple
of
ribs
in
his
body
.
Feeling
himself
so
smitten
,
*NL*
he
imagined
himself
slain
or
badly
wounded
for
certain
,
and
recollecting
*NL*
his
liquor
he
drew
out
his
flask
,
and
putting
it
to
his
mouth
began
to
*NL*
pour
the
contents
into
his
stomach
;
but
ere
he
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
swallowing
what
seemed
to
him
enough
,
there
came
another
almond
which
*NL*
struck
him
on
the
hand
and
on
the
flask
so
fairly
that
it
smashed
it
to
*NL*
pieces
,
knocking
three
or
four
teeth
and
grinders
out
of
his
mouth
in
its
*NL*
course
,
and
sorely
crushing
two
fingers
of
his
hand
.
Such
was
the
force
*NL*
of
the
first
blow
and
of
the
second
,
that
the
poor
knight
in
spite
of
*NL*
himself
came
down
backwards
off
his
horse
.
The
shepherds
came
up
,
and
*NL*
felt
sure
they
had
killed
him
;
so
in
all
haste
they
collected
their
flock
*NL*
together
,
took
up
the
dead
beasts
,
of
which
there
were
more
than
seven
,
*NL*
and
made
off
without
waiting
to
ascertain
anything
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Sancho
stood
on
the
hill
watching
the
crazy
feats
his
*NL*
master
was
performing
,
and
tearing
his
beard
and
cursing
the
hour
and
the
*NL*
occasion
when
fortune
had
made
him
acquainted
with
him
.
Seeing
him
,
then
,
*NL*
brought
to
the
ground
,
and
that
the
shepherds
had
taken
themselves
off
,
*NL*
he
ran
to
him
and
found
him
in
very
bad
case
,
though
not
unconscious
;
and
*NL*
said
he
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
not
tell
you
to
come
back
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
;
and
that
what
you
*NL*
were
going
to
attack
were
not
armies
but
droves
of
sheep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
how
that
thief
of
a
sage
,
my
enemy
,
can
alter
and
falsify
*NL*
things
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
``
thou
must
know
,
Sancho
,
that
it
is
a
very
*NL*
easy
matter
for
those
of
his
sort
to
make
us
believe
what
they
choose
;
*NL*
and
this
malignant
being
who
persecutes
me
,
envious
of
the
glory
he
knew
*NL*
I
was
to
win
in
this
battle
,
has
turned
the
squadrons
of
the
enemy
into
*NL*
droves
of
sheep
.
At
any
rate
,
do
this
much
,
I
beg
of
thee
,
Sancho
,
to
*NL*
undeceive
thyself
,
and
see
that
what
I
say
is
true
;
mount
thy
ass
and
*NL*
follow
them
quietly
,
and
thou
shalt
see
that
when
they
have
gone
some
*NL*
little
distance
from
this
they
will
return
to
their
original
shape
and
,
*NL*
ceasing
to
be
sheep
,
become
men
in
all
respects
as
I
described
them
to
*NL*
thee
at
first
.
But
go
not
just
yet
,
for
I
want
thy
help
and
assistance
;
*NL*
come
hither
,
and
see
how
many
of
my
teeth
and
grinders
are
missing
,
for
I
*NL*
feel
as
if
there
was
not
one
left
in
my
mouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
came
so
close
that
he
almost
put
his
eyes
into
his
mouth
;
now
just
*NL*
at
that
moment
the
balsam
had
acted
on
the
stomach
of
Don
Quixote
,
so
,
at
*NL*
the
very
instant
when
Sancho
came
to
examine
his
mouth
,
he
discharged
all
*NL*
its
contents
with
more
force
than
a
musket
,
and
full
into
the
beard
of
*NL*
the
compassionate
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
Mary
!
''
cried
Sancho
,
``
what
is
this
that
has
happened
me
?
Clearly
*NL*
this
sinner
is
mortally
wounded
,
as
he
vomits
blood
from
the
mouth
;
''
but
*NL*
considering
the
matter
a
little
more
closely
he
perceived
by
the
colour
,
*NL*
taste
,
and
smell
,
that
it
was
not
blood
but
the
balsam
from
the
flask
*NL*
which
he
had
seen
him
drink
;
and
he
was
taken
with
such
a
loathing
that
*NL*
his
stomach
turned
,
and
he
vomited
up
his
inside
over
his
very
master
,
*NL*
and
both
were
left
in
a
precious
state
.
Sancho
ran
to
his
ass
to
get
*NL*
something
wherewith
to
clean
himself
,
and
relieve
his
master
,
out
of
his
*NL*
alforjas
;
but
not
finding
them
,
he
well-nigh
took
leave
of
his
senses
,
*NL*
and
cursed
himself
anew
,
and
in
his
heart
resolved
to
quit
his
master
and
*NL*
return
home
,
even
though
he
forfeited
the
wages
of
his
service
and
all
*NL*
hopes
of
the
promised
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
now
rose
,
and
putting
his
left
hand
to
his
mouth
to
keep
his
*NL*
teeth
from
falling
out
altogether
,
with
the
other
he
laid
hold
of
the
*NL*
bridle
of
Rocinante
,
who
had
never
stirred
from
his
master
's
side
--
so
*NL*
loyal
and
well-behaved
was
he
--
and
betook
himself
to
where
the
squire
*NL*
stood
leaning
over
his
ass
with
his
hand
to
his
cheek
,
like
one
in
deep
*NL*
dejection
.
Seeing
him
in
this
mood
,
looking
so
sad
,
Don
Quixote
said
to
*NL*
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bear
in
mind
,
Sancho
,
that
one
man
is
no
more
than
another
,
unless
he
*NL*
does
more
than
another
;
all
these
tempests
that
fall
upon
us
are
signs
*NL*
that
fair
weather
is
coming
shortly
,
and
that
things
will
go
well
with
*NL*
us
,
for
it
is
impossible
for
good
or
evil
to
last
for
ever
;
and
hence
it
*NL*
follows
that
the
evil
having
lasted
long
,
the
good
must
be
now
nigh
at
*NL*
hand
;
so
thou
must
not
distress
thyself
at
the
misfortunes
which
happen
*NL*
to
me
,
since
thou
hast
no
share
in
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
I
not
?
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
was
he
whom
they
blanketed
yesterday
*NL*
perchance
any
other
than
my
father
's
son
?
and
the
alforjas
that
are
*NL*
missing
to-day
with
all
my
treasures

did
they
belong
to
any
other
but
*NL*
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
are
the
alforjas
missing
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
are
missing

''
answered
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
we
have
nothing
to
eat
to-day

replied
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
so

answered
Sancho
,
``

there
were
none
of

wont
to
supply
such-like
shortcomings

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
''
answered
Don

,
``
I
would
rather
have
just
now
a
*NL*
quarter
of
bread
,
or
a
loaf

heads
,
than
all

by
Dioscorides
,
even
with

notes

Nevertheless
,
Sancho
the
Good
,
mount
thy
beast
and
come
along
with
me

*NL*
for
God

who
provides

us

more
especially
*NL*
when
we
are
so
active
in

midges
of
the
air

nor
the
grubs
of
the
earth

nor
the
tadpoles
of

is
so
merciful
that

maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on

on

sendeth

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

would
make
a
better

said
*NL*
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knights-errant
knew

know
everything

said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
``

of

see
that
*NL*
the
lance
has
never
blunted
the
pen
,
nor
the
pen
the
lance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
be
it
as
your
worship
says
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
let
us
be
off
now
*NL*
and
find
some
place
of
shelter
for
the
night
,
and
God
grant
it
may
be
*NL*
somewhere
where
there
are
no
blankets
,
nor
blanketeers
,
nor
phantoms
,
nor
*NL*
enchanted
Moors
;
for
if
there
are
,
may
the
devil
take
the
whole
concern
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
that
of
God
,
my
son
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
do
thou
lead
on
where
*NL*
thou
wilt
,
for
this
time
I
leave
our
lodging
to
thy
choice
;
but
reach
me
*NL*
here
thy
hand
,
and
feel
with
thy
finger
,
and
find
out
how
many
of
my
*NL*
teeth
and
grinders
are
missing
from
this
right
side
of
the
upper
jaw
,
for
*NL*
it
is
there
I
feel
the
pain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
put
in
his
fingers
,
and
feeling
about
asked
him
,
``
How
many
*NL*
grinders
used
your
worship
have
on
this
side
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
besides
the
back-tooth
,
all
whole
and
quite
*NL*
sound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
what
you
are
saying
,
senor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
four
,
if
not
five
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
never
in
my
life
*NL*
have
I
had
tooth
or
grinder
drawn
,
nor
has
any
fallen
out
or
been
*NL*
destroyed
by
any
decay
or
rheum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
in
this
lower
side
your
worship
has
no
more
*NL*
than
two
grinders
and
a
half
,
and
in
the
upper
neither
a
half
nor
any
at
*NL*
all
,
for
it
is
all
as
smooth
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luckless
that
I
am
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
hearing
the
sad
news
his
squire
*NL*
gave
him
;
``
I
had
rather
they
despoiled
me
of
an
arm
,
so
it
were
not
the
*NL*
sword-arm
;
for
I
tell
thee
,
Sancho
,
a
mouth
without
teeth
is
like
a
mill
*NL*
without
a
millstone
,
and
a
tooth
is
much
more
to
be
prized
than
a
*NL*
diamond
;
but
we
who
profess
the
austere
order
of
chivalry
are
liable
to
*NL*
all
this
.
Mount
,
friend
,
and
lead
the
way
,
and
I
will
follow
thee
at
*NL*
whatever
pace
thou
wilt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
did
as
he
bade
him
,
and
proceeded
in
the
direction
in
which
he
*NL*
thought
he
might
find
refuge
without
quitting
the
high
road
,
which
was
*NL*
there
very
much
frequented
.
As
they
went
along
,
then
,
at
a
slow
pace
--
for
*NL*
the
pain
in
Don
Quixote
's
jaws
kept
him
uneasy
and
ill-disposed
for
*NL*
speed
--
Sancho
thought
it
well
to
amuse
and
divert
him
by
talk
of
some
*NL*
kind
,
and
among
the
things
he
said
to
him
was
that
which
will
be
told
in
*NL*
the
following
chapter
.

CHAPTER
XIX

*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
SHREWD
DISCOURSE
WHICH
SANCHO
HELD
WITH
HIS
MASTER
,
AND
OF
THE
*NL*
ADVENTURE
THAT
BEFELL
HIM
WITH
A
DEAD
BODY
,
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
NOTABLE
*NL*
OCCURRENCES
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
senor
,
that
all
these
mishaps
that
have
befallen
us
of
*NL*
late
have
been
without
any
doubt
a
punishment
for
the
offence
committed
*NL*
by
your
worship
against
the
order
of
chivalry
in
not
keeping
the
oath
you
*NL*
made
not
to
eat
bread
off
a
tablecloth
or
embrace
the
queen
,
and
all
the
*NL*
rest
of
it
that
your
worship
swore
to
observe
until
you
had
taken
that
*NL*
helmet
of
Malandrino
's
,
or
whatever
the
Moor
is
called
,
for
I
do
not
very
*NL*
well
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
very
right
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
to
tell
the
truth
,
*NL*
it
had
escaped
my
memory
;
and
likewise
thou
mayest
rely
upon
it
that
the
*NL*
affair
of
the
blanket
happened
to
thee
because
of
thy
fault
in
not
*NL*
reminding
me
of
it
in
time
;
but
I
will
make
amends
,
for
there
are
ways
of
*NL*
compounding
for
everything
in
the
order
of
chivalry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
have
I
taken
an
oath
of
some
sort
,
then
?
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
no
matter
that
thou
hast
not
taken
an
oath
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
``
suffice
it
that
I
see
thou
art
not
quite
clear
of
complicity
;
and
*NL*
whether
or
no
,
it
will
not
be
ill
done
to
provide
ourselves
with
a
*NL*
remedy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
mind
that
your
worship
does
not
forget
this
*NL*
as
you
did
the
oath
;
perhaps
the
phantoms
may
take
it
into
their
heads
to
*NL*
amuse
themselves
once
more
with
me
;
or
even
with
your
worship
if
they
see
*NL*
you
so
obstinate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
engaged
in
this
and
other
talk
,
night
overtook
them
on
the
road
*NL*
before
they
had
reached
or
discovered
any
place
of
shelter
;
and
what
made
*NL*
it
still
worse
was
that
they
were
dying
of
hunger
,
for
with
the
loss
of
*NL*
the
alforjas
they
had
lost
their
entire
larder
and
commissariat
;
and
to
*NL*
complete
the
misfortune
they
met
with
an
adventure
which
without
any
*NL*
invention
had
really
the
appearance
of
one
.
It
so
happened
that
the
night
*NL*
closed
in
somewhat
darkly
,
but
for
all
that
they
pushed
on
,
Sancho
*NL*
feeling
sure
that
as
the
road
was
the
king
's
highway
they
might
*NL*
reasonably
expect
to
find
some
inn
within
a
league
or
two
.
Going
along
,
*NL*
then
,
in
this
way
,
the
night
dark
,
the
squire
hungry
,
the
master
*NL*
sharp-set
,
they
saw
coming
towards
them
on
the
road
they
were
travelling
*NL*
a
great
number
of
lights
which
looked
exactly
like
stars
in
motion
.
*NL*
Sancho
was
taken
aback
at
the
sight
of
them
,
nor
did
Don
Quixote
*NL*
altogether
relish
them
:
the
one
pulled
up
his
ass
by
the
halter
,
the
*NL*
other
his
hack
by
the
bridle
,
and
they
stood
still
,
watching
anxiously
to
*NL*
see
what
all
this
would
turn
out
to
be
,
and
found
that
the
lights
were
*NL*
approaching
them
,
and
the
nearer
they
came
the
greater
they
seemed
,
at
*NL*
which
spectacle
Sancho
began
to
shake
like
a
man
dosed
with
mercury
,
and
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
hair
stood
on
end
;
he
,
however
,
plucking
up
spirit
a
*NL*
little
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
no
doubt
,
Sancho
,
will
be
a
most
mighty
and
perilous
adventure
,
in
*NL*
which
it
will
be
needful
for
me
to
put
forth
all
my
valour
and
*NL*
resolution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unlucky
me
!
''
answered
Sancho
;
``
if
this
adventure
happens
to
be
one
of
*NL*
phantoms
,
as
I
am
beginning
to
think
it
is
,
where
shall
I
find
the
ribs
*NL*
to
bear
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
they
phantoms
ever
so
much
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
will
not
permit
*NL*
them
to
touch
a
thread
of
thy
garments
;
for
if
they
played
tricks
with
*NL*
thee
the
time
before
,
it
was
because
I
was
unable
to
leap
the
walls
of
*NL*
the
yard
;
but
now
we
are
on
a
wide
plain
,
where
I
shall
be
able
to
wield
*NL*
my
sword
as
I
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
they
enchant
and
cripple
you
as
they
did
the
last
time
,
''
said
*NL*
Sancho
,
``
what
difference
will
it
make
being
on
the
open
plain
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
entreat
thee
,
Sancho
,
to
keep
a
*NL*
good
heart
,
for
experience
will
tell
thee
what
mine
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
please
God
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
and
the
two
retiring
to
one
side
*NL*
of
the
road
set
themselves
to
observe
closely
what
all
these
moving
*NL*
lights
might
be
;
and
very
soon
afterwards
they
made
out
some
twenty
*NL*
encamisados
,
all
on
horseback
,
with
lighted
torches
in
their
hands
,
the
*NL*
awe-inspiring
aspect
of
whom
completely
extinguished
the
courage
of
*NL*
Sancho
,
who
began
to
chatter
with
his
teeth
like
one
in
the
cold
fit
of
*NL*
an
ague
;
and
his
heart
sank
and
his
teeth
chattered
still
more
when
they
*NL*
perceived
distinctly
that
behind
them
there
came
a
litter
covered
over
*NL*
with
black
and
followed
by
six
more
mounted
figures
in
mourning
down
to
*NL*
the
very
feet
of
their
mules
--
for
they
could
perceive
plainly
they
were
*NL*
not
horses
by
the
easy
pace
at
which
they
went
.
And
as
the
encamisados
*NL*
came
along
they
muttered
to
themselves
in
a
low
plaintive
tone
.
This
*NL*
strange
spectacle
at
such
an
hour
and
in
such
a
solitary
place
was
quite
*NL*
enough
to
strike
terror
into
Sancho
's
heart
,
and
even
into
his
master
's
;
*NL*
and
-LRB-
save
in
Don
Quixote
's
case
-RRB-
did
so
,
for
all
Sancho
's
resolution
had
*NL*
now
broken
down
.
It
was
just
the
opposite
with
his
master
,
whose
*NL*
imagination
immediately
conjured
up
all
this
to
him
vividly
as
one
of
the
*NL*
adventures
of
his
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
into
his
head
that
the
litter
was
a
bier
on
which
was
borne
*NL*
some
sorely
wounded
or
slain
knight
,
to
avenge
whom
was
a
task
reserved
*NL*
for
him
alone
;
and
without
any
further
reasoning
he
laid
his
lance
in
*NL*
rest
,
fixed
himself
firmly
in
his
saddle
,
and
with
gallant
spirit
and
*NL*
bearing
took
up
his
position
in
the
middle
of
the
road
where
the
*NL*
encamisados
must
of
necessity
pass
;
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
near
at
*NL*
hand
he
raised
his
voice
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halt
,
knights
,
or
whosoever
ye
may
be
,
and
render
me
account
of
who
ye
*NL*
are
,
whence
ye
come
,
where
ye
go
,
what
it
is
ye
carry
upon
that
bier
,
*NL*
for
,
to
judge
by
appearances
,
either
ye
have
done
some
wrong
or
some
*NL*
wrong
has
been
done
to
you
,
and
it
is
fitting
and
necessary
that
I
should
*NL*
know
,
either
that
I
may
chastise
you
for
the
evil
ye
have
done
,
or
else
*NL*
that
I
may
avenge
you
for
the
injury
that
has
been
inflicted
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
in
haste
,
''
answered
one
of
the
encamisados
,
``
and
the
inn
is
far
*NL*
off
,
and
we
can
not
stop
to
render
you
such
an
account
as
you
demand
;
''
and
*NL*
spurring
his
mule
he
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
mightily
provoked
by
this
answer
,
and
seizing
the
mule
by
*NL*
the
bridle
he
said
,
``
Halt
,
and
be
more
mannerly
,
and
render
an
account
of
*NL*
what
I
have
asked
of
you
;
else
,
take
my
defiance
to
combat
,
all
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mule
was
shy
,
and
was
so
frightened
at
her
bridle
being
seized
that
*NL*
rearing
up
she
flung
her
rider
to
the
ground
over
her
haunches
.
An
*NL*
attendant
who
was
on
foot
,
seeing
the
encamisado
fall
,
began
to
abuse
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
now
moved
to
anger
,
without
any
more
ado
,
laying
his
lance
*NL*
in
rest
charged
one
of
the
men
in
mourning
and
brought
him
badly
wounded
*NL*
to
the
ground
,
and
as
he
wheeled
round
upon
the
others
the
agility
with
*NL*
which
he
attacked
and
routed
them
was
a
sight
to
see
,
for
it
seemed
just
*NL*
as
if
wings
had
that
instant
grown
upon
Rocinante
,
so
lightly
and
proudly
*NL*
did
he
bear
himself
.
The
encamisados
were
all
timid
folk
and
unarmed
,
so
*NL*
they
speedily
made
their
escape
from
the
fray
and
set
off
at
a
run
across
*NL*
the
plain
with
their
lighted
torches
,
looking
exactly
like
maskers
*NL*
running
on
some
gala
or
festival
night
.
The
mourners
,
too
,
enveloped
and
*NL*
swathed
in
their
skirts
and
gowns
,
were
unable
to
bestir
themselves
,
and
*NL*
so
with
entire
safety
to
himself
Don
Quixote
belaboured
them
all
and
*NL*
drove
them
off
against
their
will
,
for
they
all
thought
it
was
no
man
but
*NL*
a
devil
from
hell
come
to
carry
away
the
dead
body
they
had
in
the
*NL*
litter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
beheld
all
this
in
astonishment
at
the
intrepidity
of
his
lord
,
*NL*
and
said
to
himself
,
``
Clearly
this
master
of
mine
is
as
bold
and
valiant
*NL*
as
he
says
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
burning
torch
lay
on
the
ground
near
the
first
man
whom
the
mule
had
*NL*
thrown
,
by
the
light
of
which
Don
Quixote
perceived
him
,
and
coming
up
to
*NL*
him
he
presented
the
point
of
the
lance
to
his
face
,
calling
on
him
to
*NL*
yield
himself
prisoner
,
or
else
he
would
kill
him
;
to
which
the
prostrate
*NL*
man
replied
,
``
I
am
prisoner
enough
as
it
is
;
I
can
not
stir
,
for
one
of
my
*NL*
legs
is
broken
:
I
entreat
you
,
if
you
be
a
Christian
gentleman
,
not
to
*NL*
kill
me
,
which
will
be
committing
grave
sacrilege
,
for
I
am
a
licentiate
*NL*
and
I
hold
first
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
the
devil
brought
you
here
,
being
a
churchman
?
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
senor
?
''
said
the
other
.
``
My
bad
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
still
worse
awaits
you
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
you
do
not
satisfy
*NL*
me
as
to
all
I
asked
you
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
be
soon
satisfied
,
''
said
the
licentiate
;
``
you
must
know
,
then
,
*NL*
that
though
just
now
I
said
I
was
a
licentiate
,
I
am
only
a
bachelor
,
and
*NL*
my
name
is
Alonzo
Lopez
;
I
am
a
native
of
Alcobendas
,
I
come
from
the
*NL*
city
of
Baeza
with
eleven
others
,
priests
,
the
same
who
fled
with
the
*NL*
torches
,
and
we
are
going
to
the
city
of
Segovia
accompanying
a
dead
body
*NL*
which
is
in
that
litter
,
and
is
that
of
a
gentleman
who
died
in
Baeza
,
*NL*
where
he
was
interred
;
and
now
,
as
I
said
,
we
are
taking
his
bones
to
*NL*
their
burial-place
,
which
is
in
Segovia
,
where
he
was
born
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
killed
him
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
,
by
means
of
a
malignant
fever
that
took
him
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
bachelor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
Lord
has
relieved
me
of
the
task
*NL*
of
avenging
his
death
had
any
other
slain
him
;
but
,
he
who
slew
him
*NL*
having
slain
him
,
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
be
silent
,
and
shrug
*NL*
one
's
shoulders
;
I
should
do
the
same
were
he
to
slay
myself
;
and
I
would
*NL*
have
your
reverence
know
that
I
am
a
knight
of
La
Mancha
,
Don
Quixote
by
*NL*
name
,
and
it
is
my
business
and
calling
to
roam
the
world
righting
wrongs
*NL*
and
redressing
injuries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
how
that
about
righting
wrongs
can
be
,
''
said
the
bachelor
,
*NL*
``
for
from
straight
you
have
made
me
crooked
,
leaving
me
with
a
broken
leg
*NL*
that
will
never
see
itself
straight
again
all
the
days
of
its
life
;
and
*NL*
the
injury
you
have
redressed
in
my
case
has
been
to
leave
me
injured
in
*NL*
such
a
way
that
I
shall
remain
injured
for
ever
;
and
the
height
of
*NL*
misadventure
it
was
to
fall
in
with
you
who
go
in
search
of
adventures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
do
not
all
happen
in
the
same
way
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
``
it
all
*NL*
came
,
Sir
Bachelor
Alonzo
Lopez
,
of
your
going
,
as
you
did
,
by
night
,
*NL*
dressed
in
those
surplices
,
with
lighted
torches
,
praying
,
covered
with
*NL*
mourning
,
so
that
naturally
you
looked
like
something
evil
and
of
the
*NL*
other
world
;
and
so
I
could
not
avoid
doing
my
duty
in
attacking
you
,
and
*NL*
I
should
have
attacked
you
even
had
I
known
positively
that
you
were
the
*NL*
very
devils
of
hell
,
for
such
I
certainly
believed
and
took
you
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
my
fate
has
so
willed
it
,
''
said
the
bachelor
,
``
I
entreat
you
,
sir
*NL*
knight-errant
,
whose
errand
has
been
such
an
evil
one
for
me
,
to
help
me
*NL*
to
get
from
under
this
mule
that
holds
one
of
my
legs
caught
between
the
*NL*
stirrup
and
the
saddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
have
talked
on
till
to-morrow
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
how
long
were
*NL*
you
going
to
wait
before
telling
me
of
your
distress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
at
once
called
to
Sancho
,
who
,
however
,
had
no
mind
to
come
,
as
he
was
*NL*
just
then
engaged
in
unloading
a
sumpter
mule
,
well
laden
with
provender
,
*NL*
which
these
worthy
gentlemen
had
brought
with
them
.
Sancho
made
a
bag
of
*NL*
his
coat
,
and
,
getting
together
as
much
as
he
could
,
and
as
the
bag
would
*NL*
hold
,
he
loaded
his
beast
,
and
then
hastened
to
obey
his
master
's
call
,
*NL*
and
helped
him
to
remove
the
bachelor
from
under
the
mule
;
then
putting
*NL*
him
on
her
back
he
gave
him
the
torch
,
and
Don
Quixote
bade
him
follow
*NL*
the
track
of
his
companions
,
and
beg
pardon
of
them
on
his
part
for
the
*NL*
wrong
which
he
could
not
help
doing
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
said
Sancho
,
``
If
by
chance
these
gentlemen
should
want
to
know
who
*NL*
was
the
hero
that
served
them
so
,
your
worship
may
tell
them
that
he
is
*NL*
the
famous
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
otherwise
called
the
Knight
of
the
*NL*
Rueful
Countenance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bachelor
then
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
forgot
to
mention
that
before
he
did
so
he
said
to
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
``
Remember
that
you
stand
excommunicated
for
having
laid
violent
hands
on
*NL*
a
holy
thing
,
juxta
illud
,
si
quis
,
suadente
diabolo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
that
Latin
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
I
know
well
*NL*
I
did
not
lay
hands
,
only
this
pike
;
besides
,
I
did
not
think
I
was
*NL*
committing
an
assault
upon
priests
or
things
of
the
Church
,
which
,
like
a
*NL*
Catholic
and
faithful
Christian
as
I
am
,
I
respect
and
revere
,
but
upon
*NL*
phantoms
and
spectres
of
the
other
world
;
but
even
so
,
I
remember
how
it
*NL*
fared
with
Cid
Ruy
Diaz
when
he
broke
the
chair
of
the
ambassador
of
that
*NL*
king
before
his
Holiness
the
Pope
,
who
excommunicated
him
for
the
same
;
*NL*
and
yet
the
good
Roderick
of
Vivar
bore
himself
that
day
like
a
very
*NL*
noble
and
valiant
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
the
bachelor
took
his
departure
,
as
has
been
said
,
*NL*
without
making
any
reply
;
and
Don
Quixote
asked
Sancho
what
had
induced
*NL*
him
to
call
him
the
``
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
''
more
then
than
at
*NL*
any
other
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
,
''
answered
Sancho
;
``
it
was
because
I
have
been
looking
*NL*
at
you
for
some
time
by
the
light
of
the
torch
held
by
that
unfortunate
,
*NL*
and
verily
your
worship
has
got
of
late
the
most
ill-favoured
countenance
*NL*
I
ever
saw
:
it
must
be
either
owing
to
the
fatigue
of
this
combat
,
or
*NL*
else
to
the
want
of
teeth
and
grinders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
that
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
because
the
sage
whose
duty
*NL*
it
will
be
to
write
the
history
of
my
achievements
must
have
thought
it
*NL*
proper
that
I
should
take
some
distinctive
name
as
all
knights
of
yore
*NL*
did
;
one
being
`
He
of
the
Burning
Sword
,
'
another
`
He
of
the
Unicorn
,
'
*NL*
this
one
`
He
of
the
Damsels
,
'
that
`
He
of
the
Phoenix
,
'
another
`
The
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Griffin
,
'
and
another
`
He
of
the
Death
,
'
and
by
these
names
*NL*
and
designations
they
were
known
all
the
world
round
;
and
so
I
say
that
*NL*
the
sage
aforesaid
must
have
put
it
into
your
mouth
and
mind
just
now
to
*NL*
call
me
`
The
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
'
as
I
intend
to
call
*NL*
myself
from
this
day
forward
;
and
that
the
said
name
may
fit
me
better
,
I
*NL*
mean
,
when
the
opportunity
offers
,
to
have
a
very
rueful
countenance
*NL*
painted
on
my
shield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
occasion
,
senor
,
for
wasting
time
or
money
on
making
that
*NL*
countenance
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
all
that
need
be
done
is
for
your
worship
*NL*
to
show
your
own
,
face
to
face
,
to
those
who
look
at
you
,
and
without
*NL*
anything
more
,
either
image
or
shield
,
they
will
call
you
`
Him
of
the
*NL*
Rueful
Countenance
'
and
believe
me
I
am
telling
you
the
truth
,
for
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
senor
-LRB-
and
in
good
part
be
it
said
-RRB-
,
hunger
and
the
loss
of
*NL*
your
grinders
have
given
you
such
an
ill-favoured
face
that
,
as
I
say
,
*NL*
the
rueful
picture
may
be
very
well
spared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
laughed
at
Sancho
's
pleasantry
;
nevertheless
he
resolved
to
*NL*
call
himself
by
that
name
,
and
have
his
shield
or
buckler
painted
as
he
*NL*
had
devised
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
would
have
looked
to
see
whether
the
body
in
the
litter
were
*NL*
bones
or
not
,
but
Sancho
would
not
have
it
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
you
have
ended
this
perilous
adventure
more
safely
for
yourself
*NL*
than
any
of
those
I
have
seen
:
perhaps
these
people
,
though
beaten
and
*NL*
routed
,
may
bethink
themselves
that
it
is
a
single
man
that
has
beaten
*NL*
them
,
and
feeling
sore
and
ashamed
of
it
may
take
heart
and
come
in
*NL*
search
of
us
and
give
us
trouble
enough
.
The
ass
is
in
proper
trim
,
the
*NL*
mountains
are
near
at
hand
,
hunger
presses
,
we
have
nothing
more
to
do
*NL*
but
make
good
our
retreat
,
and
,
as
the
saying
is
,
the
dead
to
the
grave
*NL*
and
the
living
to
the
loaf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
driving
his
ass
before
him
he
begged
his
master
to
follow
,
who
,
*NL*
feeling
that
Sancho
was
right
,
did
so
without
replying
;
and
after
*NL*
proceeding
some
little
distance
between
two
hills
they
found
themselves
*NL*
in
a
wide
and
retired
valley
,
where
they
alighted
,
and
Sancho
unloaded
*NL*
his
beast
,
and
stretched
upon
the
green
grass
,
with
hunger
for
sauce
,
*NL*
they
breakfasted
,
dined
,
lunched
,
and
supped
all
at
once
,
satisfying
*NL*
their
appetites
with
more
than
one
store
of
cold
meat
which
the
dead
*NL*
man
's
clerical
gentlemen
-LRB-
who
seldom
put
themselves
on
short
allowance
-RRB-
*NL*
had
brought
with
them
on
their
sumpter
mule
.
But
another
piece
of
*NL*
ill-luck
befell
them
,
which
Sancho
held
the
worst
of
all
,
and
that
was
*NL*
that
they
had
no
wine
to
drink
,
nor
even
water
to
moisten
their
lips
;
and
*NL*
as
thirst
tormented
them
,
Sancho
,
observing
that
the
meadow
where
they
*NL*
were
was
full
of
green
and
tender
grass
,
said
what
will
be
told
in
the
*NL*
following
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XX

*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
UNEXAMPLED
AND
UNHEARD-OF
ADVENTURE
WHICH
WAS
ACHIEVED
BY
THE
*NL*
VALIANT
DON
QUIXOTE
OF
LA
MANCHA
WITH
LESS
PERIL
THAN
ANY
EVER
ACHIEVED
*NL*
BY
ANY
FAMOUS
KNIGHT
IN
THE
WORLD
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
,
senor
,
but
that
this
grass
is
a
proof
that
there
must
be
*NL*
hard
by
some
spring
or
brook
to
give
it
moisture
,
so
it
would
be
well
to
*NL*
move
a
little
farther
on
,
that
we
may
find
some
place
where
we
may
quench
*NL*
this
terrible
thirst
that
plagues
us
,
which
beyond
a
doubt
is
more
*NL*
distressing
than
hunger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
advice
seemed
good
to
Don
Quixote
,
and
,
he
leading
Rocinante
by
the
*NL*
bridle
and
Sancho
the
ass
by
the
halter
,
after
he
had
packed
away
upon
*NL*
him
the
remains
of
the
supper
,
they
advanced
the
meadow
feeling
their
*NL*
way
,
for
the
darkness
of
the
night
made
it
impossible
to
see
anything
;
*NL*
but
they
had
not
gone
two
hundred
paces
when
a
loud
noise
of
water
,
as
if
*NL*
falling
from
great
rocks
,
struck
their
ears
.
The
sound
cheered
them
*NL*
greatly
;
but
halting
to
make
out
by
listening
from
what
quarter
it
came
*NL*
they
heard
unseasonably
another
noise
which
spoiled
the
satisfaction
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
water
gave
them
,
especially
for
Sancho
,
who
was
by
nature
*NL*
timid
and
faint-hearted
.
They
heard
,
I
say
,
strokes
falling
with
a
*NL*
measured
beat
,
and
a
certain
rattling
of
iron
and
chains
that
,
together
*NL*
with
the
furious
din
of
the
water
,
would
have
struck
terror
into
any
*NL*
heart
but
Don
Quixote
's
.
The
night
was
,
as
has
been
said
,
dark
,
and
they
*NL*
had
happened
to
reach
a
spot
in
among
some
tall
trees
,
whose
leaves
*NL*
stirred
by
a
gentle
breeze
made
a
low
ominous
sound
;
so
that
,
what
with
*NL*
the
solitude
,
the
place
,
the
darkness
,
the
noise
of
the
water
,
and
the
*NL*
rustling
of
the
leaves
,
everything
inspired
awe
and
dread
;
more
*NL*
especially
as
they
perceived
that
the
strokes
did
not
cease
,
nor
the
wind
*NL*
lull
,
nor
morning
approach
;
to
all
which
might
be
added
their
ignorance
*NL*
as
to
where
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Don
Quixote
,
supported
by
his
intrepid
heart
,
leaped
on
Rocinante
,
*NL*
and
bracing
his
buckler
on
his
arm
,
brought
his
pike
to
the
slope
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Friend
Sancho
,
know
that
I
by
Heaven
's
will
have
been
born
in
this
*NL*
our
iron
age
to
revive
in
it
the
age
of
gold
,
or
the
golden
as
it
*NL*
is
called
;
I
am
he
for
whom
perils
,
mighty
achievements
,
and
valiant
*NL*
deeds
are
reserved
;
I
am
,
I
say
again
,
he
who
is
to
revive
the
Knights
of
*NL*
the
Round
Table
,
the
Twelve
of
France
and
the
Nine
Worthies
;
and
he
who
*NL*
is
to
consign
to
oblivion
the
Platirs
,
the
Tablantes
,
the
Olivantes
and
*NL*
Tirantes
,
the
Phoebuses
and
Belianises
,
with
the
whole
herd
of
famous
*NL*
knights-errant
of
days
gone
by
,
performing
in
these
in
which
I
live
such
*NL*
exploits
,
marvels
,
and
feats
of
arms
as
shall
obscure
their
brightest
*NL*
deeds
.
Thou
dost
mark
well
,
faithful
and
trusty
squire
,
the
gloom
of
this
*NL*
night
,
its
strange
silence
,
the
dull
confused
murmur
of
those
trees
,
the
*NL*
awful
sound
of
that
water
in
quest
of
which
we
came
,
that
seems
as
though
*NL*
it
were
precipitating
and
dashing
itself
down
from
the
lofty
mountains
of
*NL*
the
Moon
,
and
that
incessant
hammering
that
wounds
and
pains
our
ears
;
*NL*
which
things
all
together
and
each
of
itself
are
enough
to
instil
fear
,
*NL*
dread
,
and
dismay
into
the
breast
of
Mars
himself
,
much
more
into
one
not
*NL*
used
to
hazards
and
adventures
of
the
kind
.
Well
,
then
,
all
this
that
I
*NL*
put
before
thee
is
but
an
incentive
and
stimulant
to
my
spirit
,
making
my
*NL*
heart
burst
in
my
bosom
through
eagerness
to
engage
in
this
adventure
,
*NL*
arduous
as
it
promises
to
be
;
therefore
tighten
Rocinante
's
girths
a
*NL*
little
,
and
God
be
with
thee
;
wait
for
me
here
three
days
and
no
more
,
*NL*
and
if
in
that
time
I
come
not
back
,
thou
canst
return
to
our
village
,
*NL*
and
thence
,
to
do
me
a
favour
and
a
service
,
thou
wilt
go
to
El
Toboso
,
*NL*
where
thou
shalt
say
to
my
incomparable
lady
Dulcinea
that
her
captive
*NL*
knight
hath
died
in
attempting
things
that
might
make
him
worthy
of
being
*NL*
called
hers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sancho
heard
his
master
's
words
he
began
to
weep
in
the
most
*NL*
pathetic
way
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
I
know
not
why
your
worship
wants
to
attempt
this
so
dreadful
*NL*
adventure
;
it
is
night
now
,
no
one
sees
us
here
,
we
can
easily
turn
about
*NL*
and
take
ourselves
out
of
danger
,
even
if
we
do
n't
drink
for
three
days
*NL*
to
come
;
and
as
there
is
no
one
to
see
us
,
all
the
less
will
there
be
*NL*
anyone
to
set
us
down
as
cowards
;
besides
,
I
have
many
a
time
heard
the
*NL*
curate
of
our
village
,
whom
your
worship
knows
well
,
preach
that
he
who
*NL*
seeks
danger
perishes
in
it
;
so
it
is
not
right
to
tempt
God
by
trying
so
*NL*
tremendous
a
feat
from
which
there
can
be
no
escape
save
by
a
miracle
,
*NL*
and
Heaven
has
performed
enough
of
them
for
your
worship
in
delivering
*NL*
you
from
being
blanketed
as
I
was
,
and
bringing
you
out
victorious
and
*NL*
safe
and
sound
from
among
all
those
enemies
that
were
with
the
dead
man
;
*NL*
and
if
all
this
does
not
move
or
soften
that
hard
heart
,
let
this
thought
*NL*
and
reflection
move
it
,
that
you
will
have
hardly
quitted
this
spot
when
*NL*
from
pure
fear
I
shall
yield
my
soul
up
to
anyone
that
will
take
it
.
I
*NL*
left
home
and
wife
and
children
to
come
and
serve
your
worship
,
trusting
*NL*
to
do
better
and
not
worse
;
but
as
covetousness
bursts
the
bag
,
it
has
*NL*
rent
my
hopes
asunder
,
for
just
as
I
had
them
highest
about
getting
that
*NL*
wretched
unlucky
island
your
worship
has
so
often
promised
me
,
I
see
that
*NL*
instead
and
in
lieu
of
it
you
mean
to
desert
me
now
in
a
place
so
far
*NL*
from
human
reach
:
for
God
's
sake
,
master
mine
,
deal
not
so
unjustly
by
*NL*
me
,
and
if
your
worship
will
not
entirely
give
up
attempting
this
feat
,
*NL*
at
least
put
it
off
till
morning
,
for
by
what
the
lore
I
learned
when
I
*NL*
was
a
shepherd
tells
me
it
can
not
want
three
hours
of
dawn
now
,
because
*NL*
the
mouth
of
the
Horn
is
overhead
and
makes
midnight
in
the
line
of
the
*NL*
left
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
canst
thou
see
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
where
it
makes
that
*NL*
line
,
or
where
this
mouth
or
this
occiput
is
that
thou
talkest
of
,
when
*NL*
the
night
is
so
dark
that
there
is
not
a
star
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
*NL*
heaven
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
fear
has
sharp
eyes
,
and
sees
things
*NL*
underground
,
much
more
above
in
heavens
;
besides
,
there
is
good
reason
to
*NL*
show
that
it
now
wants
but
little
of
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
want
what
it
may
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
it
shall
not
be
said
of
*NL*
me
now
or
at
any
time
that
tears
or
entreaties
turned
me
aside
from
doing
*NL*
what
was
in
accordance
with
knightly
usage
;
and
so
I
beg
of
thee
,
Sancho
,
*NL*
to
hold
thy
peace
,
for
God
,
who
has
put
it
into
my
heart
to
undertake
now
*NL*
this
so
unexampled
and
terrible
adventure
,
will
take
care
to
watch
over
*NL*
my
safety
and
console
thy
sorrow
;
what
thou
hast
to
do
is
to
tighten
*NL*
Rocinante
's
girths
well
,
and
wait
here
,
for
I
shall
come
back
shortly
,
*NL*
alive
or
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
perceiving
it
his
master
's
final
resolve
,
and
how
little
his
*NL*
tears
,
counsels
,
and
entreaties
prevailed
with
him
,
determined
to
have
*NL*
recourse
to
his
own
ingenuity
and
compel
him
,
if
he
could
,
to
wait
till
*NL*
daylight
;
and
so
,
while
tightening
the
girths
of
the
horse
,
he
quietly
*NL*
and
without
being
felt
,
with
his
ass
'
halter
tied
both
Rocinante
's
legs
,
*NL*
so
that
when
Don
Quixote
strove
to
go
he
was
unable
as
the
horse
could
*NL*
only
move
by
jumps
.
Seeing
the
success
of
his
trick
,
Sancho
Panza
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
there
,
senor
!
Heaven
,
moved
by
my
tears
and
prayers
,
has
so
ordered
*NL*
it
that
Rocinante
can
not
stir
;
and
if
you
will
be
obstinate
,
and
spur
and
*NL*
strike
him
,
you
will
only
provoke
fortune
,
and
kick
,
as
they
say
,
against
*NL*
the
pricks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
at
this
grew
desperate
,
but
the
more
he
drove
his
heels
into
*NL*
the
horse
,
the
less
he
stirred
him
;
and
not
having
any
suspicion
of
the
*NL*
tying
,
he
was
fain
to
resign
himself
and
wait
till
daybreak
or
until
*NL*
Rocinante
could
move
,
firmly
persuaded
that
all
this
came
of
something
*NL*
other
than
Sancho
's
ingenuity
.
So
he
said
to
him
,
``
As
it
is
so
,
Sancho
,
*NL*
and
as
Rocinante
can
not
move
,
I
am
content
to
wait
till
dawn
smiles
upon
*NL*
us
,
even
though
I
weep
while
it
delays
its
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
need
to
weep
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
for
I
will
amuse
your
*NL*
worship
by
telling
stories
from
this
till
daylight
,
unless
indeed
you
*NL*
like
to
dismount
and
lie
down
to
sleep
a
little
on
the
green
grass
after
*NL*
the
fashion
of
knights-errant
,
so
as
to
be
fresher
when
day
comes
and
the
*NL*
moment
arrives
for
attempting
this
extraordinary
adventure
you
are
*NL*
looking
forward
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
thou
talking
about
dismounting
or
sleeping
for
?
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
``
Am
I
,
thinkest
thou
,
one
of
those
knights
that
take
their
rest
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
danger
?
Sleep
thou
who
art
born
to
sleep
,
or
do
as
*NL*
thou
wilt
,
for
I
will
act
as
I
think
most
consistent
with
my
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
angry
,
master
mine
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
I
did
not
mean
to
say
*NL*
that
;
''
and
coming
close
to
him
he
laid
one
hand
on
the
pommel
of
the
*NL*
saddle
and
the
other
on
the
cantle
so
that
he
held
his
master
's
left
*NL*
thigh
in
his
embrace
,
not
daring
to
separate
a
finger
's
width
from
him
;
*NL*
so
much
afraid
was
he
of
the
strokes
which
still
resounded
with
a
regular
*NL*
beat
.
Don
Quixote
bade
him
tell
some
story
to
amuse
him
as
he
had
*NL*
proposed
,
to
which
Sancho
replied
that
he
would
if
his
dread
of
what
he
*NL*
heard
would
let
him
;
``
Still
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
will
strive
to
tell
a
story
*NL*
which
,
if
I
can
manage
to
relate
it
,
and
nobody
interferes
with
the
*NL*
telling
,
is
the
best
of
stories
,
and
let
your
worship
give
me
your
*NL*
attention
,
for
here
I
begin
.
What
was
,
was
;
and
may
the
good
that
is
to
*NL*
come
be
for
all
,
and
the
evil
for
him
who
goes
to
look
for
it
--
your
*NL*
worship
must
know
that
the
beginning
the
old
folk
used
to
put
to
their
*NL*
tales
was
not
just
as
each
one
pleased
;
it
was
a
maxim
of
Cato
Zonzorino
*NL*
the
Roman
,
that
says
`
the
evil
for
him
that
goes
to
look
for
it
,
'
and
it
*NL*
comes
as
pat
to
the
purpose
now
as
ring
to
finger
,
to
show
that
your
*NL*
worship
should
keep
quiet
and
not
go
looking
for
evil
in
any
quarter
,
and
*NL*
that
we
should
go
back
by
some
other
road
,
since
nobody
forces
us
to
*NL*
follow
this
in
which
so
many
terrors
affright
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
with
thy
story
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
leave
the
choice
*NL*
of
our
road
to
my
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
then
,
''
continued
Sancho
,
``
that
in
a
village
of
Estremadura
there
*NL*
was
a
goat-shepherd
--
that
is
to
say
,
one
who
tended
goats
--
which
shepherd
*NL*
or
goatherd
,
as
my
story
goes
,
was
called
Lope
Ruiz
,
and
this
Lope
Ruiz
*NL*
was
in
love
with
a
shepherdess
called
Torralva
,
which
shepherdess
called
*NL*
Torralva
was
the
daughter
of
a
rich
grazier
,
and
this
rich
grazier
-
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
the
way
thou
tellest
thy
tale
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
``
repeating
twice
all
thou
hast
to
say
,
thou
wilt
not
have
done
these
two
*NL*
days
;
go
straight
on
with
it
,
and
tell
it
like
a
reasonable
man
,
or
else
*NL*
say
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tales
are
always
told
in
my
country
in
the
very
way
I
am
telling
this
,
''
*NL*
answered
Sancho
,
``
and
I
can
not
tell
it
in
any
other
,
nor
is
it
right
of
*NL*
your
worship
to
ask
me
to
make
new
customs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
it
as
thou
wilt
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
as
fate
will
have
it
*NL*
that
I
can
not
help
listening
to
thee
,
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
lord
of
my
soul
,
''
continued
Sancho
,
as
I
have
said
,
this
*NL*
shepherd
was
in
love
with
Torralva
the
shepherdess
,
who
was
a
wild
buxom
*NL*
lass
with
something
of
the
look
of
a
man
about
her
,
for
she
had
little
*NL*
moustaches
;
I
fancy
I
see
her
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
knew
her
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
her
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
he
who
told
me
the
story
said
it
*NL*
was
so
true
and
certain
that
when
I
told
it
to
another
I
might
safely
*NL*
declare
and
swear
I
had
seen
it
all
myself
.
And
so
in
course
of
time
,
the
*NL*
devil
,
who
never
sleeps
and
puts
everything
in
confusion
,
contrived
that
*NL*
the
love
the
shepherd
bore
the
shepherdess
turned
into
hatred
and
*NL*
ill-will
,
and
the
reason
,
according
to
evil
tongues
,
was
some
little
*NL*
jealousy
she
caused
him
that
crossed
the
line
and
trespassed
on
forbidden
*NL*
ground
;
and
so
much
did
the
shepherd
hate
her
from
that
time
forward
*NL*
that
,
in
order
to
escape
from
her
,
he
determined
to
quit
the
country
and
*NL*
go
where
he
should
never
set
eyes
on
her
again
.
Torralva
,
when
she
found
*NL*
herself
spurned
by
Lope
,
was
immediately
smitten
with
love
for
him
,
*NL*
though
she
had
never
loved
him
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
natural
way
of
women
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
to
scorn
the
one
*NL*
that
loves
them
,
and
love
the
one
that
hates
them
:
go
on
,
Sancho
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
came
to
pass
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
the
shepherd
carried
out
his
*NL*
intention
,
and
driving
his
goats
before
him
took
his
way
across
the
*NL*
plains
of
Estremadura
to
pass
over
into
the
Kingdom
of
Portugal
.
*NL*
Torralva
,
who
knew
of
it
,
went
after
him
,
and
on
foot
and
barefoot
*NL*
followed
him
at
a
distance
,
with
a
pilgrim
's
staff
in
her
hand
and
a
*NL*
scrip
round
her
neck
,
in
which
she
carried
,
it
is
said
,
a
bit
of
*NL*
looking-glass
and
a
piece
of
a
comb
and
some
little
pot
or
other
of
paint
*NL*
for
her
face
;
but
let
her
carry
what
she
did
,
I
am
not
going
to
trouble
*NL*
myself
to
prove
it
;
all
I
say
is
,
that
the
shepherd
,
they
say
,
came
with
*NL*
his
flock
to
cross
over
the
river
Guadiana
,
which
was
at
that
time
*NL*
swollen
and
almost
overflowing
its
banks
,
and
at
the
spot
he
came
to
*NL*
there
was
neither
ferry
nor
boat
nor
anyone
to
carry
him
or
his
flock
to
*NL*
the
other
side
,
at
which
he
was
much
vexed
,
for
he
perceived
that
*NL*
Torralva
was
approaching
and
would
give
him
great
annoyance
with
her
*NL*
tears
and
entreaties
;
however
,
he
went
looking
about
so
closely
that
he
*NL*
discovered
a
fisherman
who
had
alongside
of
him
a
boat
so
small
that
it
*NL*
could
only
hold
one
person
and
one
goat
;
but
for
all
that
he
spoke
to
him
*NL*
and
agreed
with
him
to
carry
himself
and
his
three
hundred
goats
across
.
*NL*
The
fisherman
got
into
the
boat
and
carried
one
goat
over
;
he
came
back
*NL*
and
carried
another
over
;
he
came
back
again
,
and
again
brought
over
*NL*
another
--
let
your
worship
keep
count
of
the
goats
the
fisherman
is
taking
*NL*
across
,
for
if
one
escapes
the
memory
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
story
,
*NL*
and
it
will
be
impossible
to
tell
another
word
of
it
.
To
proceed
,
I
must
*NL*
tell
you
the
landing
place
on
the
other
side
was
miry
and
slippery
,
and
*NL*
the
fisherman
lost
a
great
deal
of
time
in
going
and
coming
;
still
he
*NL*
returned
for
another
goat
,
and
another
,
and
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
for
granted
he
brought
them
all
across
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
*NL*
do
n't
keep
going
and
coming
in
this
way
,
or
thou
wilt
not
make
an
end
of
*NL*
bringing
them
over
this
twelvemonth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
have
gone
across
so
far
?
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
the
devil
do
I
know
?
''
replied
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
what
I
told
you
,
that
you
must
keep
a
good
*NL*
count
;
well
then
,
by
God
,
there
is
an
end
of
the
story
,
for
there
is
no
*NL*
going
any
farther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
that
be
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
is
it
so
essential
to
the
story
to
*NL*
know
to
a
nicety
the
goats
that
have
crossed
over
,
that
if
there
be
a
*NL*
mistake
of
one
in
the
reckoning
,
thou
canst
not
go
on
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
senor
,
not
a
bit
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
for
when
I
asked
your
worship
to
*NL*
tell
me
how
many
goats
had
crossed
,
and
you
answered
you
did
not
know
,
at
*NL*
that
very
instant
all
I
had
to
say
passed
away
out
of
my
memory
,
and
,
*NL*
faith
,
there
was
much
virtue
in
it
,
and
entertainment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
then
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
story
has
come
to
an
end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
much
as
my
mother
has
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
thou
hast
told
one
of
the
rarest
stories
,
*NL*
tales
,
or
histories
,
that
anyone
in
the
world
could
have
imagined
,
and
*NL*
such
a
way
of
telling
it
and
ending
it
was
never
seen
nor
will
be
in
a
*NL*
lifetime
;
though
I
expected
nothing
else
from
thy
excellent
*NL*
understanding
.
But
I
do
not
wonder
,
for
perhaps
those
ceaseless
strokes
*NL*
may
have
confused
thy
wits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
may
be
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
but
I
know
that
as
to
my
story
,
all
*NL*
that
can
be
said
is
that
it
ends
there
where
the
mistake
in
the
count
of
*NL*
the
passage
of
the
goats
begins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
end
where
it
will
,
well
and
good
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
let
us
*NL*
see
if
Rocinante
can
go
;
''
and
again
he
spurred
him
,
and
again
Rocinante
*NL*
made
jumps
and
remained
where
he
was
,
so
well
tied
was
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
,
whether
it
was
the
cold
of
the
morning
that
was
now
*NL*
approaching
,
or
that
he
had
eaten
something
laxative
at
supper
,
or
that
*NL*
it
was
only
natural
-LRB-
as
is
most
likely
-RRB-
,
Sancho
felt
a
desire
to
do
what
*NL*
no
one
could
do
for
him
;
but
so
great
was
the
fear
that
had
penetrated
*NL*
his
heart
,
he
dared
not
separate
himself
from
his
master
by
as
much
as
*NL*
the
black
of
his
nail
;
to
escape
doing
what
he
wanted
was
,
however
,
also
*NL*
impossible
;
so
what
he
did
for
peace
's
sake
was
to
remove
his
right
hand
,
*NL*
which
held
the
back
of
the
saddle
,
and
with
it
to
untie
gently
and
*NL*
silently
the
running
string
which
alone
held
up
his
breeches
,
so
that
on
*NL*
loosening
it
they
at
once
fell
down
round
his
feet
like
fetters
;
he
then
*NL*
raised
his
shirt
as
well
as
he
could
and
bared
his
hind
quarters
,
no
slim
*NL*
ones
.
But
,
this
accomplished
,
which
he
fancied
was
all
he
had
to
do
to
*NL*
get
out
of
this
terrible
strait
and
embarrassment
,
another
still
greater
*NL*
difficulty
presented
itself
,
for
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
to
relieve
*NL*
himself
without
making
some
noise
,
and
he
ground
his
teeth
and
squeezed
*NL*
his
shoulders
together
,
holding
his
breath
as
much
as
he
could
;
but
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
precautions
he
was
unlucky
enough
after
all
to
make
a
little
*NL*
noise
,
very
different
from
that
which
was
causing
him
so
much
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
hearing
it
,
said
,
``
What
noise
is
that
,
Sancho
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
senor
,
''
said
he
;
``
it
must
be
something
new
,
for
adventures
*NL*
and
misadventures
never
begin
with
a
trifle
.
''
Once
more
he
tried
his
*NL*
luck
,
and
succeeded
so
well
,
that
without
any
further
noise
or
*NL*
disturbance
he
found
himself
relieved
of
the
burden
that
had
given
him
so
*NL*
much
discomfort
.
But
as
Don
Quixote
's
sense
of
smell
was
as
acute
as
his
*NL*
hearing
,
and
as
Sancho
was
so
closely
linked
with
him
that
the
fumes
rose
*NL*
almost
in
a
straight
line
,
it
could
not
be
but
that
some
should
reach
his
*NL*
nose
,
and
as
soon
as
they
did
he
came
to
its
relief
by
compressing
it
*NL*
between
his
fingers
,
saying
in
a
rather
snuffing
tone
,
``
Sancho
,
it
*NL*
strikes
me
thou
art
in
great
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
answered
Sancho
;
``
but
how
does
your
worship
perceive
it
now
more
*NL*
than
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
just
now
thou
smellest
stronger
than
ever
,
and
not
of
*NL*
ambergris
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
that
's
not
my
fault
,
but
your
worship
's
,
*NL*
for
leading
me
about
at
unseasonable
hours
and
at
such
unwonted
paces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
go
back
three
or
four
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
all
the
time
*NL*
with
his
fingers
to
his
nose
;
``
and
for
the
future
pay
more
attention
to
*NL*
thy
person
and
to
what
thou
owest
to
mine
;
for
it
is
my
great
familiarity
*NL*
with
thee
that
has
bred
this
contempt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
bet
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
that
your
worship
thinks
I
have
done
*NL*
something
I
ought
not
with
my
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
it
worse
to
stir
it
,
friend
Sancho
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
and
other
talk
of
the
same
sort
master
and
man
passed
the
*NL*
night
,
till
Sancho
,
perceiving
that
daybreak
was
coming
on
apace
,
very
*NL*
cautiously
untied
Rocinante
and
tied
up
his
breeches
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
Rocinante
found
himself
free
,
though
by
nature
he
was
not
at
all
*NL*
mettlesome
,
he
seemed
to
feel
lively
and
began
pawing
--
for
as
to
*NL*
capering
,
begging
his
pardon
,
he
knew
not
what
it
meant
.
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
then
,
observing
that
Rocinante
could
move
,
took
it
as
a
good
sign
and
a
*NL*
signal
that
he
should
attempt
the
dread
adventure
.
By
this
time
day
had
*NL*
fully
broken
and
everything
showed
distinctly
,
and
Don
Quixote
saw
that
*NL*
he
was
among
some
tall
trees
,
chestnuts
,
which
cast
a
very
deep
shade
;
he
*NL*
perceived
likewise
that
the
sound
of
the
strokes
did
not
cease
,
but
could
*NL*
not
discover
what
caused
it
,
and
so
without
any
further
delay
he
let
*NL*
Rocinante
feel
the
spur
,
and
once
more
taking
leave
of
Sancho
,
he
told
*NL*
him
to
wait
for
him
there
three
days
at
most
,
as
he
had
said
before
,
and
*NL*
if
he
should
not
have
returned
by
that
time
,
he
might
feel
sure
it
had
*NL*
been
God
's
will
that
he
should
end
his
days
in
that
perilous
adventure
.
*NL*
He
again
repeated
the
message
and
commission
with
which
he
was
to
go
on
*NL*
his
behalf
to
his
lady
Dulcinea
,
and
said
he
was
not
to
be
uneasy
as
to
*NL*
the
payment
of
his
services
,
for
before
leaving
home
he
had
made
his
*NL*
will
,
in
which
he
would
find
himself
fully
recompensed
in
the
matter
of
*NL*
wages
in
due
proportion
to
the
time
he
had
served
;
but
if
God
delivered
*NL*
him
safe
,
sound
,
and
unhurt
out
of
that
danger
,
he
might
look
upon
the
*NL*
promised
island
as
much
more
than
certain
.
Sancho
began
to
weep
afresh
on
*NL*
again
hearing
the
affecting
words
of
his
good
master
,
and
resolved
to
*NL*
stay
with
him
until
the
final
issue
and
end
of
the
business
.
From
these
*NL*
tears
and
this
honourable
resolve
of
Sancho
Panza
's
the
author
of
this
*NL*
history
infers
that
he
must
have
been
of
good
birth
and
at
least
an
old
*NL*
Christian
;
and
the
feeling
he
displayed
touched
his
but
not
so
much
as
to
*NL*
make
him
show
any
weakness
;
on
the
contrary
,
hiding
what
he
felt
as
well
*NL*
as
he
could
,
he
began
to
move
towards
that
quarter
whence
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
water
and
of
the
strokes
seemed
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
followed
him
on
foot
,
leading
by
the
halter
,
as
his
custom
was
,
*NL*
his
ass
,
his
constant
comrade
in
prosperity
or
adversity
;
and
advancing
*NL*
some
distance
through
the
shady
chestnut
trees
they
came
upon
a
little
*NL*
meadow
at
the
foot
of
some
high
rocks
,
down
which
a
mighty
rush
of
water
*NL*
flung
itself
.
At
the
foot
of
the
rocks
were
some
rudely
constructed
*NL*
houses
looking
more
like
ruins
than
houses
,
from
among
which
came
,
they
*NL*
perceived
,
the
din
and
clatter
of
blows
,
which
still
continued
without
*NL*
intermission
.
Rocinante
took
fright
at
the
noise
of
the
water
and
of
the
*NL*
blows
,
but
quieting
him
Don
Quixote
advanced
step
by
step
towards
the
*NL*
houses
,
commending
himself
with
all
his
heart
to
his
lady
,
imploring
her
*NL*
support
in
that
dread
pass
and
enterprise
,
and
on
the
way
commending
*NL*
himself
to
God
,
too
,
not
to
forget
him
.
Sancho
who
never
quitted
his
*NL*
side
,
stretched
his
neck
as
far
as
he
could
and
peered
between
the
legs
*NL*
of
Rocinante
to
see
if
he
could
now
discover
what
it
was
that
caused
him
*NL*
such
fear
and
apprehension
.
They
went
it
might
be
a
hundred
paces
*NL*
farther
,
when
on
turning
a
corner
the
true
cause
,
beyond
the
possibility
*NL*
of
any
mistake
,
of
that
dread-sounding
and
to
them
awe-inspiring
noise
*NL*
that
had
kept
them
all
the
night
in
such
fear
and
perplexity
,
appeared
*NL*
plain
and
obvious
;
and
it
was
-LRB-
if
,
reader
,
thou
art
not
disgusted
and
*NL*
disappointed
-RRB-
six
fulling
hammers
which
by
their
alternate
strokes
made
*NL*
all
the
din
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Don
Quixote
perceived
what
it
was
,
he
was
struck
dumb
and
rigid
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
.
Sancho
glanced
at
him
and
saw
him
with
his
head
bent
down
*NL*
upon
his
breast
in
manifest
mortification
;
and
Don
Quixote
glanced
at
*NL*
Sancho
and
saw
him
with
his
cheeks
puffed
out
and
his
mouth
full
of
*NL*
laughter
,
and
evidently
ready
to
explode
with
it
,
and
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
vexation
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
sight
of
him
;
and
when
Sancho
*NL*
saw
his
master
begin
he
let
go
so
heartily
that
he
had
to
hold
his
sides
*NL*
with
both
hands
to
keep
himself
from
bursting
with
laughter
.
Four
times
*NL*
he
stopped
,
and
as
many
times
did
his
laughter
break
out
afresh
with
the
*NL*
same
violence
as
at
first
,
whereat
Don
Quixote
grew
furious
,
above
all
*NL*
when
he
heard
him
say
mockingly
,
``
Thou
must
know
,
friend
Sancho
,
that
of
*NL*
Heaven
's
will
I
was
born
in
this
our
iron
age
to
revive
in
it
the
golden
*NL*
or
age
of
gold
;
I
am
he
for
whom
are
reserved
perils
,
mighty
*NL*
achievements
,
valiant
deeds
;
''
and
here
he
went
on
repeating
the
words
*NL*
that
Don
Quixote
uttered
the
first
time
they
heard
the
awful
strokes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
then
,
seeing
that
Sancho
was
turning
him
into
ridicule
,
was
*NL*
so
mortified
and
vexed
that
he
lifted
up
his
pike
and
smote
him
two
such
*NL*
blows
that
if
,
instead
of
catching
them
on
his
shoulders
,
he
had
caught
*NL*
them
on
his
head
there
would
have
been
no
wages
to
pay
,
unless
indeed
to
*NL*
his
heirs
.
Sancho
seeing
that
he
was
getting
an
awkward
return
in
earnest
*NL*
for
his
jest
,
and
fearing
his
master
might
carry
it
still
further
,
said
*NL*
to
him
very
humbly
,
``
Calm
yourself
,
sir
,
for
by
God
I
am
only
joking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
if
you
are
joking
I
am
not
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
.
``
Look
*NL*
here
,
my
lively
gentleman
,
if
these
,
instead
of
being
fulling
hammers
,
*NL*
had
been
some
perilous
adventure
,
have
I
not
,
think
you
,
shown
the
*NL*
courage
required
for
the
attempt
and
achievement
?
Am
I
,
perchance
,
being
,
*NL*
as
I
am
,
a
gentleman
,
bound
to
know
and
distinguish
sounds
and
tell
*NL*
whether
they
come
from
fulling
mills
or
not
;
and
that
,
when
perhaps
,
as
*NL*
is
the
case
,
I
have
never
in
my
life
seen
any
as
you
have
,
low
boor
as
*NL*
you
are
,
that
have
been
born
and
bred
among
them
?
But
turn
me
these
six
*NL*
hammers
into
six
giants
,
and
bring
them
to
beard
me
,
one
by
one
or
all
*NL*
together
,
and
if
I
do
not
knock
them
head
over
heels
,
then
make
what
*NL*
mockery
you
like
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
of
that
,
senor
,
''
returned
Sancho
;
``
I
own
I
went
a
little
too
far
*NL*
with
the
joke
.
But
tell
me
,
your
worship

now
that
peace
is
made
between
*NL*
us
-LRB-
and
may
God
bring
you
out
of
all
the
adventures
that
may
befall
you

as
safe

sound
as
he
has
brought
you
out
of
this
one

was
it
not
a
*NL*
thing
to
laugh
at
,
and
is
it
not
a
good
story

the
great
fear
we
were
*NL*
in
?

at

that
I
was
in
;
for
as
to
your
worship
I
see
now
that

either
fear

dismay
is

*NL*
``
I
do
not
deny
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
what
happened
to
us
may
be
worth
*NL*
laughing
at
,
but
it
is
not
worth
making
a
story
about
,
for
it
is
not
*NL*
everyone
that
is
shrewd
enough
to
hit
the
right
point
of
a
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
your
worship
knew
how
to
hit
the
right
point
*NL*
with
your
pike
,
aiming
at
my
head
and
hitting
me
on
the
shoulders
,
thanks
*NL*
be
to
God
and
my
own
smartness
in
dodging
it
.
But
let
that
pass
;
all
will
*NL*
come
out
in
the
scouring
;
for
I
have
heard
say
`
he
loves
thee
well
that
*NL*
makes
thee
weep
;
'
and
moreover
that
it
is
the
way
with
great
lords
after
*NL*
any
hard
words
they
give
a
servant
to
give
him
a
pair
of
breeches
;
though
*NL*
I
do
not
know
what
they
give
after
blows
,
unless
it
be
that
*NL*
knights-errant
after
blows
give
islands
,
or
kingdoms
on
the
mainland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
on
the
dice
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
all
thou
sayest
will
*NL*
come
true
;
overlook
the
past
,
for
thou
art
shrewd
enough
to
know
that
our
*NL*
first
movements
are
not
in
our
own
control
;
and
one
thing
for
the
future
*NL*
bear
in
mind
,
that
thou
curb
and
restrain
thy
loquacity
in
my
company
;
*NL*
for
in
all
the
books
of
chivalry
that
I
have
read
,
and
they
are
*NL*
innumerable
,
I
never
met
with
a
squire
who
talked
so
much
to
his
lord
as
*NL*
thou
dost
to
thine
;
and
in
fact
I
feel
it
to
be
a
great
fault
of
thine
*NL*
and
of
mine
:
of
thine
,
that
thou
hast
so
little
respect
for
me
;
of
mine
,
*NL*
that
I
do
not
make
myself
more
respected
.
There
was
Gandalin
,
the
squire
*NL*
of
Amadis
of
Gaul
,
that
was
Count
of
the
Insula
Firme
,
and
we
read
of
him
*NL*
that
he
always
addressed
his
lord
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
,
his
head
*NL*
bowed
down
and
his
body
bent
double
,
more
turquesco
.
And
then
,
what
shall
*NL*
we
say
of
Gasabal
,
the
squire
of
Galaor
,
who
was
so
silent
that
in
order
*NL*
to
indicate
to
us
the
greatness
of
his
marvellous
taciturnity
his
name
is
*NL*
only
once
mentioned
in
the
whole
of
that
history
,
as
long
as
it
is
*NL*
truthful
?
From
all
I
have
said
thou
wilt
gather
,
Sancho
,
that
there
must
*NL*
be
a
difference
between
master
and
man
,
between
lord
and
lackey
,
between
*NL*
knight
and
squire
:
so
that
from
this
day
forward
in
our
intercourse
we
*NL*
must
observe
more
respect
and
take
less
liberties
,
for
in
whatever
way
I
*NL*
may
be
provoked
with
you
it
will
be
bad
for
the
pitcher
.
The
favours
and
*NL*
benefits
that
I
have
promised
you
will
come
in
due
time
,
and
if
they
do
*NL*
not
your
wages
at
least
will
not
be
lost
,
as
I
have
already
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
your
worship
says
is
very
well
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
I
should
*NL*
like
to
know
-LRB-
in
case
the
time
of
favours
should
not
come
,
and
it
might
*NL*
be
necessary
to
fall
back
upon
wages
-RRB-
how
much
did
the
squire
of
a
*NL*
knight-errant
get
in
those
days
,
and
did
they
agree
by
the
month
,
or
by
*NL*
the
day
like
bricklayers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
believe
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
such
squires
were
ever
on
*NL*
wages
,
but
were
dependent
on
favour
;
and
if
I
have
now
mentioned
thine
in
*NL*
the
sealed
will
I
have
left
at
home
,
it
was
with
a
view
to
what
may
*NL*
happen
;
for
as
yet
I
know
not
how
chivalry
will
turn
out
in
these
*NL*
wretched
times
of
ours
,
and
I
do
not
wish
my
soul
to
suffer
for
trifles
*NL*
in
the
other
world
;
for
I
would
have
thee
know
,
Sancho
,
that
in
this
*NL*
there
is
no
condition
more
hazardous
than
that
of
adventurers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
since
the
mere
noise
of
the
hammers
of
a
*NL*
fulling
mill
can
disturb
and
disquiet
the
heart
of
such
a
valiant
errant
*NL*
adventurer
as
your
worship
;
but
you
may
be
sure
I
will
not
open
my
lips
*NL*
henceforward
to
make
light
of
anything
of
your
worship
's
,
but
only
to
*NL*
honour
you
as
my
master
and
natural
lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
so
doing
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
shalt
thou
live
long
on
the
face
of
*NL*
the
earth
;
for
next
to
parents

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
THE
EXALTED
ADVENTURE
AND
RICH
PRIZE
OF
MAMBRINO
'S
*NL*
HELMET
,
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
HAPPENED
TO
OUR
INVINCIBLE
KNIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
now
began
to
rain
a
little
,
and
Sancho
was
for
going
into
the
fulling
*NL*
mills
,
but
Don
Quixote
had
taken
such
an
abhorrence
to
them
on
account
of
*NL*
the
late
joke
that
he
would
not
enter
them
on
any
account
;
so
turning
*NL*
aside
to
right
they
came
upon
another
road
,
different
from
that
which
*NL*
they
had
taken
the
night
before
.
Shortly
afterwards
Don
Quixote
perceived
*NL*
a
man
on
horseback
who
wore
on
his
head
something
that
shone
like
gold
,
*NL*
and
the
moment
he
saw
him
he
turned
to
Sancho
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
Sancho
,
there
is
no
proverb
that
is
not
true
,
all
being
maxims
*NL*
drawn
from
experience
itself
,
the
mother
of
all
the
sciences
,
especially
*NL*
that
one
that
says
,
`
Where
one
door
shuts
,
another
opens
.
'
I
say
so
*NL*
because
if
last
night
fortune
shut
the
door
of
the
adventure
we
were
*NL*
looking
for
against
us
,
cheating
us
with
the
fulling
mills
,
it
now
opens
*NL*
wide
another
one
for
another
better
and
more
certain
adventure
,
and
if
I
*NL*
do
not
contrive
to
enter
it
,
it
will
be
my
own
fault
,
and
I
can
not
lay
it
*NL*
to
my
ignorance
of
fulling
mills
,
or
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
I
say
*NL*
this
because
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
there
comes
towards
us
one
who
wears
on
*NL*
his
head
the
helmet
of
Mambrino
,
concerning
which
I
took
the
oath
thou
*NL*
rememberest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
what
you
say
,
your
worship
,
and
still
more
what
you
do
,
''
said
*NL*
Sancho
,
``
for
I
do
n't
want
any
more
fulling
mills
to
finish
off
fulling
*NL*
and
knocking
our
senses
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
take
thee
,
man
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
what
has
a
helmet
to
do
*NL*
with
fulling
mills
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
but
,
faith
,
if
I
might
speak
as
I
used
,
*NL*
perhaps
I
could
give
such
reasons
that
your
worship
would
see
you
were
*NL*
mistaken
in
what
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
be
mistaken
in
what
I
say
,
unbelieving
traitor
?
''
returned
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
``
tell
me
,
seest
thou
not
yonder
knight
coming
towards
us
on
a
*NL*
dappled
grey
steed
,
who
has
upon
his
head
a
helmet
of
gold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
see
and
make
out
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
is
only
a
man
on
a
grey
ass
*NL*
like
my
own
,
who
has
something
that
shines
on
his
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
is
the
helmet
of
Mambrino
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
stand
to
one
*NL*
side
and
leave
me
alone
with
him
;
thou
shalt
see
how
,
without
saying
a
*NL*
word
,
to
save
time
,
I
shall
bring
this
adventure
to
an
issue
and
possess
*NL*
myself
of
the
helmet
I
have
so
longed
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
care
to
stand
aside
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
God
grant
,
I
say
*NL*
once
more
,
that
it
may
be
marjoram
and
not
fulling
mills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
thee
,
brother
,
on
no
account
to
mention
those
fulling
mills
*NL*
to
me
again
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
or
I
vow
--
and
I
say
no
more-I
'll
full
*NL*
the
soul
out
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
held
his
peace
in
dread
lest
his
master
should
carry
out
the
vow
*NL*
he
had
hurled
like
a
bowl
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
of
the
matter
as
regards
the
helmet
,
steed
,
and
knight
that
Don
*NL*
Quixote
saw
,
was
this
.
In
that
neighbourhood
there
were
two
villages
,
one
*NL*
of
them
so
small
that
it
had
neither
apothecary
's
shop
nor
barber
,
which
*NL*
the
other
that
was
close
to
it
had
,
so
the
barber
of
the
larger
served
*NL*
the
smaller
,
and
in
it
there
was
a
sick
man
who
required
to
be
bled
and
*NL*
another
man
who
wanted
to
be
shaved
,
and
on
this
errand
the
barber
was
*NL*
going
,
carrying
with
him
a
brass
basin
;
but
as
luck
would
have
it
,
as
he
*NL*
was
on
the
way
it
began
to
rain
,
and
not
to
spoil
his
hat
,
which
probably
*NL*
was
a
new
one
,
he
put
the
basin
on
his
head
,
and
being
clean
it
glittered
*NL*
at
half
a
league
's
distance
.
He
rode
upon
a
grey
ass
,
as
Sancho
said
,
and
*NL*
this
was
what
made
it
seem
to
Don
Quixote
to
be
a
dapple-grey
steed
and
a
*NL*
knight
and
a
golden
helmet
;
for
everything
he
saw
he
made
to
fall
in
with
*NL*
his
crazy
chivalry
and
ill-errant
notions
;
and
when
he
saw
the
poor
*NL*
knight
draw
near
,
without
entering
into
any
parley
with
him
,
at
*NL*
Rocinante
's
top
speed
he
bore
down
upon
him
with
the
pike
pointed
low
,
*NL*
fully
determined
to
run
him
through
and
through
,
and
as
he
reached
him
,
*NL*
without
checking
the
fury
of
his
charge
,
he
cried
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Defend
thyself
,
miserable
being
,
or
yield
me
of
thine
own
accord
that
*NL*
which
is
so
reasonably
my
due
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
barber
,
who
without
any
expectation
or
apprehension
of
it
saw
this
*NL*
apparition
coming
down
upon
him
,
had
no
other
way
of
saving
himself
from
*NL*
the
stroke
of
the
lance
but
to
let
himself
fall
off
his
ass
;
and
no
*NL*
sooner
had
he
touched
the
ground
than
he
sprang
up
more
nimbly
than
a
*NL*
deer
and
sped
away
across
the
plain
faster
than
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
basin
on
the
ground
,
with
which
Don
Quixote
contented
*NL*
himself
,
saying
that
the
pagan
had
shown
his
discretion
and
imitated
the
*NL*
beaver
,
which
finding
itself
pressed
by
the
hunters
bites
and
cuts
off
*NL*
with
its
teeth
that
for
which
,
by
its
natural
instinct
,
it
knows
it
is
*NL*
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
Sancho
to
pick
up
the
helmet
,
and
he
taking
it
in
his
hands
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
the
basin
is
a
good
one
,
and
worth
a
real
of
eight
if
it
is
worth
*NL*
a
maravedis
,
''
and
handed
it
to
his
master
,
who
immediately
put
it
on
his
*NL*
head
,
turning
it
round
,
now
this
way
,
now
that
,
in
search
of
fitment
,
and
*NL*
not
finding
it
he
said
,
``
Clearly
the
pagan
to
whose
measure
this
famous
*NL*
head-piece
was
first
forged
must
have
had
a
very
large
head
;
but
the
*NL*
worst
of
it
is
half
of
it
is
wanting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sancho
heard
him
call
the
basin
a
headpiece
he
was
unable
to
*NL*
restrain
his
laughter
,
but
remembering
his
master
's
wrath
he
checked
*NL*
himself
in
the
midst
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
thou
laughing
at
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
laughing
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
think
of
the
great
head
the
pagan
must
have
*NL*
had
who
owned
this
helmet
,
for
it
looks
exactly
like
a
regular
barber
's
*NL*
basin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
know
what
I
suspect
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
that
this
*NL*
wonderful
piece
of
this
enchanted
helmet
must
by
some
strange
accident
*NL*
have
come
into
the
hands
of
some
one
who
was
unable
to
recognise
or
*NL*
realise
its
value
,
and
who
,
not
knowing
what
he
did
,
and
seeing
it
to
be
*NL*
of
the
purest
gold
,
must
have
melted
down
one
half
for
the
sake
of
what
*NL*
it
might
be
worth
,
and
of
the
other
made
this
which
is
like
a
barber
's
*NL*
basin
as
thou
sayest
;
but
be
it
as
it
may
,
to
me
who
recognise
it
,
its
*NL*
transformation
makes
no
difference
,
for
I
will
set
it
to
rights
at
the
*NL*
first
village
where
there
is
a
blacksmith
,
and
in
such
style
that
that
*NL*
helmet
the
god
of
smithies
forged
for
the
god
of
battles
shall
not
*NL*
surpass
it
or
even
come
up
to
it
;
and
in
the
meantime
I
will
wear
it
as
*NL*
well
as
I
can
,
for
something
is
better
than
nothing
;
all
the
more
as
it
*NL*
will
be
quite
enough
to
protect
me
from
any
chance
blow
of
a
stone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
if
it
is
not
shot
with
a
sling
as
they
were
in
*NL*
the
battle
of
the
two
armies
,
when
they
signed
the
cross
on
your
*NL*
worship
's
grinders
and
smashed
the
flask
with
that
blessed
draught
that
*NL*
made
me
vomit
my
bowels
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
not
grieve
me
much
to
have
lost
it
,

said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
thou
*NL*
knowest

Sancho

I
have
the
receipt
in
my
memory

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
have
I
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
but
if
ever
I
make
it
,
or
try
it
again
as
*NL*
long
as
I
live
,
may
this
be
my
last
hour
;
moreover
,
I
have
no
intention
*NL*
of
putting
myself
in
the
way
of
wanting
it
,
for
I
mean
,
with
all
my
five
*NL*
senses
,
to
keep
myself
from
being
wounded
or
from
wounding
anyone
:
as
to
*NL*
being
blanketed
again
I
say
nothing
,
for
it
is
hard
to
prevent
mishaps
of
*NL*
that
sort
,
and
if
they
come
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
squeeze
our
*NL*
shoulders
together
,
hold
our
breath
,
shut
our
eyes
,
and
let
ourselves
go
*NL*
where
luck
and
the
blanket
may
send
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
a
bad
Christian
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
on
hearing
this
,
*NL*
``
for
once
an
injury
has
been
done
thee
thou
never
forgettest
it
:
but
know
*NL*
that
it
is
the
part
of
noble
and
generous
hearts
not
to
attach
importance
*NL*
to
trifles
.
What
lame
leg
hast
thou
got
by
it
,
what
broken
rib
,
what
*NL*
cracked
head
,
that
thou
canst
not
forget
that
jest
?
For
jest
and
sport
it
*NL*
was
,
properly
regarded
,
and
had
I
not
seen
it
in
that
light
I
would
have
*NL*
returned
and
done
more
mischief
in
revenging
thee
than
the
Greeks
did
for
*NL*
the
rape
of
Helen
,
who
,
if
she
were
alive
now
,
or
if
my
Dulcinea
had
*NL*
lived
then
,
might
depend
upon
it
she
would
not
be
so
famous
for
her
*NL*
beauty
as
she
is
;
''
and
here
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
sent
it
aloft
;
and
said
*NL*
Sancho
,
``
Let
it
pass
for
a
jest
as
it
can
not
be
revenged
in
earnest
,
but
*NL*
I
know
what
sort
of
jest
and
earnest
it
was
,
and
I
know
it
will
never
be
*NL*
rubbed
out
of
my
memory
any
more
than
off
my
shoulders
.
But
putting
that
*NL*
aside
,
will
your
worship
tell
me
what
are
we
to
do
with
this
dapple-grey
*NL*
steed
that
looks
like
a
grey
ass
,
which
that
Martino
that
your
worship
*NL*
overthrew
has
left
deserted
here
?
for
,
from
the
way
he
took
to
his
heels
*NL*
and
bolted
,
he
is
not
likely
ever
to
come
back
for
it
;
and
by
my
beard
*NL*
but
the
grey
is
a
good
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
been
in
the
habit
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
of
taking
spoil
of
*NL*
those
whom
I
vanquish
,
nor
is
it
the
practice
of
chivalry
to
take
away
*NL*
their
horses
and
leave
them
to
go
on
foot
,
unless
indeed
it
be
that
the
*NL*
victor
have
lost
his
own
in
the
combat
,
in
which
case
it
is
lawful
to
*NL*
take
that
of
the
vanquished
as
a
thing
won
in
lawful
war
;
therefore
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
leave
this
horse
,
or
ass
,
or
whatever
thou
wilt
have
it
to
be
;
*NL*
for
when
its
owner
sees
us
gone
hence
he
will
come
back
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
I
should
like
to
take
it
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
or
at
least
to
*NL*
change
it
for
my
own
,
which
does
not
seem
to
me
as
good
a
one
:
verily
the
*NL*
laws
of
chivalry
are
strict
,
since
they
can
not
be
stretched
to
let
one
*NL*
ass
be
changed
for
another
;
I
should
like
to
know
if
I
might
at
least
*NL*
change
trappings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
that
head
I
am
not
quite
certain
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
the
*NL*
matter
being
doubtful
,
pending
better
information
,
I
say
thou
mayest
*NL*
change
them
,
if
so
be
thou
hast
urgent
need
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
urgent
is
it
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
that
if
they
were
for
my
own
person
*NL*
I
could
not
want
them
more
;
''
and
forthwith
,
fortified
by
this
licence
,
he
*NL*
effected
the
mutatio
capparum
,
rigging
out
his
beast
to
the
ninety-nines
*NL*
and
making
quite
another
thing
of
it
.
This
done
,
they
broke
their
fast
on
*NL*
the
remains
of
the
spoils
of
war
plundered
from
the
sumpter
mule
,
and
*NL*
drank
of
the
brook
that
flowed
from
the
fulling
mills
,
without
casting
a
*NL*
look
in
that
direction
,
in
such
loathing
did
they
hold
them
for
the
alarm
*NL*
they
had
caused
them
;
and
,
all
anger
and
gloom
removed
,
they
mounted
and
,
*NL*
without
taking
any
fixed
road
-LRB-
not
to
fix
upon
any
being
the
proper
thing
*NL*
for
true
knights-errant
-RRB-
,
they
set
out
,
guided
by
Rocinante
's
will
,
which
*NL*
carried
along
with
it
that
of
his
master
,
not
to
say
that
of
the
ass
,
*NL*
which
always
followed
him
wherever
he
led
,
lovingly
and
sociably
;
*NL*
nevertheless
they
returned
to
the
high
road
,
and
pursued
it
at
a
venture
*NL*
without
any
other
aim
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
along
,
then
,
in
this
way
Sancho
said
to
his
master
,
``
Senor
,
*NL*
would
your
worship
give
me
leave
to
speak
a
little
to
you
?
For
since
you
*NL*
laid
that
hard
injunction
of
silence
on
me
several
things
have
gone
to
*NL*
rot
in
my
stomach
,
and
I
have
now
just
one
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
be
spoiled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
on
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
be
brief
in
thy
discourse
,
for
*NL*
there
is
no
pleasure
in
one
that
is
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
senor
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
I
say
that
for
some
days
past
I
*NL*
have
been
considering
how
little
is
got
or
gained
by
going
in
search
of
*NL*
these
adventures
that
your
worship
seeks
in
these
wilds
and
cross-roads
,
*NL*
where
,
even
if
the
most
perilous
are
victoriously
achieved
,
there
is
no
*NL*
one
to
see
or
know
of
them
,
and
so
they
must
be
left
untold
for
ever
,
to
*NL*
the
loss
of
your
worship
's
object
and
the
credit
they
deserve
;
therefore
*NL*
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
better
-LRB-
saving
your
worship
's
better
judgment
-RRB-
*NL*
if
we
were
to
go
and
serve
some
emperor
or
other
great
prince
who
may
*NL*
have
some
war
on
hand
,
in
whose
service
your
worship
may
prove
the
worth
*NL*
of
your
person
,
your
great
might
,
and
greater
understanding
,
on
*NL*
perceiving
which
the
lord
in
whose
service
we
may
be
will
perforce
have
*NL*
to
reward
us
,
each
according
to
his
merits
;
and
there
you
will
not
be
at
*NL*
a
loss
for
some
one
to
set
down
your
achievements
in
writing
so
as
to
*NL*
preserve
their
memory
for
ever
.
Of
my
own
I
say
nothing
,
as
they
will
not
*NL*
go
beyond
squirely
limits
,
though
I
make
bold
to
say
that
,
if
it
be
the
*NL*
practice
in
chivalry
to
write
the
achievements
of
squires
,
I
think
mine
*NL*
must
not
be
left
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
speakest
not
amiss
,
Sancho
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
before
that
*NL*
point
is
reached
it
is
requisite
to
roam
the
world
,
as
it
were
on
*NL*
probation
,
seeking
adventures
,
in
order
that
,
by
achieving
some
,
name
and
*NL*
fame
may
be
acquired
,
such
that
when
he
betakes
himself
to
the
court
of
*NL*
some
great
monarch
the
knight
may
be
already
known
by
his
deeds
,
and
that
*NL*
the
boys
,
the
instant
they
see
him
enter
the
gate
of
the
city
,
may
all
*NL*
follow
him
and
surround
him
,
crying
,
`
This
is
the
Knight
of
the
Sun
'
-
or
*NL*
the
Serpent
,
or
any
other
title
under
which
he
may
have
achieved
great
*NL*
deeds
.
`
This
,
'
they
will
say
,
`
is
he
who
vanquished
in
single
combat
the
*NL*
gigantic
Brocabruno
of
mighty
strength
;
he
who
delivered
the
great
*NL*
Mameluke
of
Persia
out
of
the
long
enchantment
under
which
he
had
been
*NL*
for
almost
nine
hundred
years
.
'
So
from
one
to
another
they
will
go
*NL*
proclaiming
his
achievements
;
and
presently
at
the
tumult
of
the
boys
and
*NL*
the
others
the
king
of
that
kingdom
will
appear
at
the
windows
of
his
*NL*
royal
palace
,
and
as
soon
as
he
beholds
the
knight
,
recognising
him
by
*NL*
his
arms
and
the
device
on
his
shield
,
he
will
as
a
matter
of
course
say
,
*NL*
`
What
ho
!
Forth
all
ye
,
the
knights
of
my
court
,
to
receive
the
flower
of
*NL*
chivalry
who
cometh
hither
!
'
At
which
command
all
will
issue
forth
,
and
*NL*
he
himself
,
advancing
half-way
down
the
stairs
,
will
embrace
him
closely
,
*NL*
and
salute
him
,
kissing
him
on
the
cheek
,
and
will
then
lead
him
to
the
*NL*
queen
's
chamber
,
where
the
knight
will
find
her
with
the
princess
her
*NL*
daughter
,
who
will
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
accomplished
damsels
*NL*
that
could
with
the
utmost
pains
be
discovered
anywhere
in
the
known
*NL*
world
.
Straightway
it
will
come
to
pass
that
she
will
fix
her
eyes
upon
*NL*
the
knight
and
he
his
upon
her
,
and
each
will
seem
to
the
other
something
*NL*
more
divine
than
human
,
and
,
without
knowing
how
or
why
they
will
be
*NL*
taken
and
entangled
in
the
inextricable
toils
of
love
,
and
sorely
*NL*
distressed
in
their
hearts
not
to
see
any
way
of
making
their
pains
and
*NL*
sufferings
known
by
speech
.
Thence
they
will
lead
him
,
no
doubt
,
to
some
*NL*
richly
adorned
chamber
of
the
palace
,
where
,
having
removed
his
armour
,
*NL*
they
will
bring
him
a
rich
mantle
of
scarlet
wherewith
to
robe
himself
,
*NL*
and
if
he
looked
noble
in
his
armour
he
will
look
still
more
so
in
a
*NL*
doublet
.
When
night
comes
he
will
sup
with
the
king
,
queen
,
and
princess
;
*NL*
and
all
the
time
he
will
never
take
his
eyes
off
her
,
stealing
stealthy
*NL*
glances
,
unnoticed
by
those
present
,
and
she
will
do
the
same
,
and
with
*NL*
equal
cautiousness
,
being
,
as
I
have
said
,
a
damsel
of
great
discretion
.
*NL*
The
tables
being
removed
,
suddenly
through
the
door
of
the
hall
there
*NL*
will
enter
a
hideous
and
diminutive
dwarf
followed
by
a
fair
dame
,
*NL*
between
two
giants
,
who
comes
with
a
certain
adventure
,
the
work
of
an
*NL*
ancient
sage
;
and
he
who
shall
achieve
it
shall
be
deemed
the
best
knight
*NL*
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
king
will
then
command
all
those
present
to
essay
it
,
and
none
will
*NL*
bring
it
to
an
end
and
conclusion
save
the
stranger
knight
,
to
the
great
*NL*
enhancement
of
his
fame
,
whereat
the
princess
will
be
overjoyed
and
will
*NL*
esteem
herself
happy
and
fortunate
in
having
fixed
and
placed
her
*NL*
thoughts
so
high
.
And
the
best
of
it
is
that
this
king
,
or
prince
,
or
*NL*
whatever
he
is
,
is
engaged
in
a
very
bitter
war
with
another
as
powerful
*NL*
as
himself
,
and
the
stranger
knight
,
after
having
been
some
days
at
his
*NL*
court
,
requests
leave
from
him
to
go
and
serve
him
in
the
said
war
.
The
*NL*
king
will
grant
it
very
readily
,
and
the
knight
will
courteously
kiss
his
*NL*
hands
for
the
favour
done
to
him
;
and
that
night
he
will
take
leave
of
*NL*
his
lady
the
princess
at
the
grating
of
the
chamber
where
she
sleeps
,
*NL*
which
looks
upon
a
garden
,
and
at
which
he
has
already
many
times
*NL*
conversed
with
her
,
the
go-between
and
confidante
in
the
matter
being
a
*NL*
damsel
much
trusted
by
the
princess
.
He
will
sigh
,
she
will
swoon
,
the
*NL*
damsel
will
fetch
water
,
much
distressed
because
morning
approaches
,
and
*NL*
for
the
honour
of
her
lady
he
would
not
that
they
were
discovered
;
at
*NL*
last
the
princess
will
come
to
herself
and
will
present
her
white
hands
*NL*
through
the
grating
to
the
knight
,
who
will
kiss
them
a
thousand
and
a
*NL*
thousand
times
,
bathing
them
with
his
tears
.
It
will
be
arranged
between
*NL*
them
how
they
are
to
inform
each
other
of
their
good
or
evil
fortunes
,
*NL*
and
the
princess
will
entreat
him
to
make
his
absence
as
short
as
*NL*
possible
,
which
he
will
promise
to
do
with
many
oaths
;
once
more
he
*NL*
kisses
her
hands
,
and
takes
his
leave
in
such
grief
that
he
is
well-nigh
*NL*
ready
to
die
.
He
betakes
him
thence
to
his
chamber
,
flings
himself
on
his
*NL*
bed
,
can
not
sleep
for
sorrow
at
parting
,
rises
early
in
the
morning
,
goes
*NL*
to
take
leave
of
the
king
,
queen
,
and
princess
,
and
,
as
he
takes
his
*NL*
leave
of
the
pair
,
it
is
told
him
that
the
princess
is
indisposed
and
*NL*
can
not
receive
a
visit
;
the
knight
thinks
it
is
from
grief
at
his
*NL*
departure
,
his
heart
is
pierced
,
and
he
is
hardly
able
to
keep
from
*NL*
showing
his
pain
.
The
confidante
is
present
,
observes
all
,
goes
to
tell
*NL*
her
mistress
,
who
listens
with
tears
and
says
that
one
of
her
greatest
*NL*
distresses
is
not
knowing
who
this
knight
is
,
and
whether
he
is
of
kingly
*NL*
lineage
or
not
;
the
damsel
assures
her
that
so
much
courtesy
,
gentleness
,
*NL*
and
gallantry
of
bearing
as
her
knight
possesses
could
not
exist
in
any
*NL*
save
one
who
was
royal
and
illustrious
;
her
anxiety
is
thus
relieved
,
and
*NL*
she
strives
to
be
of
good
cheer
lest
she
should
excite
suspicion
in
her
*NL*
parents
,
and
at
the
end
of
two
days
she
appears
in
public
.
Meanwhile
the
*NL*
knight
has
taken
his
departure
;
he
fights
in
the
war
,
conquers
the
king
's
*NL*
enemy
,
wins
many
cities
,
triumphs
in
many
battles
,
returns
to
the
court
,
*NL*
sees
his
lady
where
he
was
wont
to
see
her
,
and
it
is
agreed
that
he
*NL*
shall
demand
her
in
marriage
of
her
parents
as
the
reward
of
his
*NL*
services
;
the
king
is
unwilling
to
give
her
,
as
he
knows
not
who
he
is
,
*NL*
but
nevertheless
,
whether
carried
off
or
in
whatever
other
way
it
may
be
,
*NL*
the
princess
comes
to
be
his
bride
,
and
her
father
comes
to
regard
it
as
*NL*
very
good
fortune
;
for
it
so
happens
that
this
knight
is
proved
to
be
the
*NL*
son
of
a
valiant
king
of
some
kingdom
,
I
know
not
what
,
for
I
fancy
it
is
*NL*
not
likely
to
be
on
the
map
.
The
father
dies
,
the
princess
inherits
,
and
*NL*
in
two
words
the
knight
becomes
king
.
And
here
comes
in
at
once
the
*NL*
bestowal
of
rewards
upon
his
squire
and
all
who
have
aided
him
in
rising
*NL*
to
so
exalted
a
rank
.
He
marries
his
squire
to
a
damsel
of
the
*NL*
princess
's
,
who
will
be
,
no
doubt
,
the
one
who
was
confidante
in
their
*NL*
amour
,
and
is
daughter
of
a
very
great
duke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
want
,
and
no
mistake
about
it
!
''
said
Sancho
.
``
That
's
what
*NL*
I
'm
waiting
for
;
for
all
this
,
word
for
word
,
is
in
store
for
your
*NL*
worship
under
the
title
of
the
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
needst
not
doubt
it
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
,
and
by
the
same
steps
as
I
have
described
here
,
knights-errant
*NL*
rise
and
have
risen
to
be
kings
and
emperors
;
all
we
want
now
is
to
find
*NL*
out
what
king
,
Christian
or
pagan
,
is
at
war
and
has
a
beautiful
*NL*
daughter
;
but
there
will
be
time
enough
to
think
of
that
,
for
,
as
I
have
*NL*
told
thee
,
fame
must
be
won
in
other
quarters
before
repairing
to
the
*NL*
court
.
There
is
another
thing
,
too
,
that
is
wanting
;
for
supposing
we
*NL*
find
a
king
who
is
at
war
and
has
a
beautiful
daughter
,
and
that
I
have
*NL*
won
incredible
fame
throughout
the
universe
,
I
know
not
how
it
can
be
*NL*
made
out
that
I
am
of
royal
lineage
,
or
even
second
cousin
to
an
emperor
;
*NL*
for
the
king
will
not
be
willing
to
give
me
his
daughter
in
marriage
*NL*
unless
he
is
first
thoroughly
satisfied
on
this
point
,
however
much
my
*NL*
famous
deeds
may
deserve
it
;
so
that
by
this
deficiency
I
fear
I
shall
*NL*
lose
what
my
arm
has
fairly
earned
.
True
it
is
I
am
a
gentleman
of
known
*NL*
house
,
of
estate
and
property
,
and
entitled
to
the
five
hundred
sueldos
*NL*
mulct
;
and
it
may
be
that
the
sage
who
shall
write
my
history
will
so
*NL*
clear
up
my
ancestry
and
pedigree
that
I
may
find
myself
fifth
or
sixth
*NL*
in
descent
from
a
king
;
for
I
would
have
thee
know
,
Sancho
,
that
there
*NL*
are
two
kinds
of
lineages
in
the
world
;
some
there
be
tracing
and
*NL*
deriving
their
descent
from
kings
and
princes
,
whom
time
has
reduced
*NL*
little
by
little
until
they
end
in
a
point
like
a
pyramid
upside
down
;
*NL*
and
others
who
spring
from
the
common
herd
and
go
on
rising
step
by
step
*NL*
until
they
come
to
be
great
lords
;
so
that
the
difference
is
that
the
one
*NL*
were
what
they
no
longer
are
,
and
the
others
are
what
they
formerly
were
*NL*
not
.
And
I
may
be
of
such
that
after
investigation
my
origin
may
prove
*NL*
great
and
famous
,
with
which
the
king
,
my
father-in-law
that
is
to
be
,
*NL*
ought
to
be
satisfied
;
and
should
he
not
be
,
the
princess
will
so
love
me
*NL*
that
even
though
she
well
knew
me
to
be
the
son
of
a
water-carrier
,
she
*NL*
will
take
me
for
her
lord
and
husband
in
spite
of
her
father
;
if
not
,
*NL*
then
it
comes
to
seizing
her
and
carrying
her
off
where
I
please
;
for
*NL*
time
or
death
will
put
an
end
to
the
wrath
of
her
parents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
comes
to
this
,
too
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
what
some
naughty
people
say
,
*NL*
`
Never
ask
as
a
favour
what
thou
canst
take
by
force

though
it
would
*NL*
fit
better
to
say
,
'
A
clear
escape
is
better
than
good
men
's
prayers

'
I
*NL*
say
so
because
if
my
lord
the
king
,
your
worship
's
father-in-law
,
will
*NL*
not
condescend
to
give
you
my
lady
the
princess
,
there
is
nothing
for
it
*NL*
but
,
as
your
worship
says
,
to
seize
her
and
transport
her
.
But
the
*NL*
mischief
is
that
until
peace
is
made
and
you
come
into
the
peaceful
*NL*
enjoyment
of
your
kingdom

the
poor
squire
is
famishing
as
far
as
rewards

go

unless
it
be
that
the
confidante
damsel
that
is
to
be
his
wife
comes
*NL*
with
the
princess

that
with
her
he
tides
over
his
bad
luck
until
*NL*
Heaven
otherwise
orders
things
;
for
his
master
,
I
suppose
,
may
as
well
*NL*
give
her
to
him
at
once
for
a
lawful
wife

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
can
object
to
that

said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
since
that
may
be

said
Sancho
,
``
there
is
nothing
for
it

*NL*
``

more

said
Don

;
``

even

give

nobility

when

I
make

thou
art
at
once
a
gentleman
;

they
may
say
*NL*
what
they
will

by
my
faith
they
will
have
to
call
thee

your
*NL*
lordship

whether
they
like
it

not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
doubt
of
it

and
I
'll
know
how
to
support
the
tittle

said
*NL*
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Title
thou
shouldst
say

not
tittle

said
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it

answered
Sancho

``
I
say
I
will
know
how
to
behave

for

life
I
was
beadle

brotherhood

the
beadle

gown
sat
so

well
on
me
that
all
said
I
looked
as

be
steward
of
the

What
will
it
be

then
,
when
I
put

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
wilt
look
well
,
''
said
Don

,
``
but
thou
must
shave
thy
beard
*NL*
often

thou
hast
it
so
thick

rough

unkempt

not

it

distance

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
more
will
it
be

said
Sancho

``
than
having
a
barber

keeping
*NL*
him
at
wages
in
the
house

even
if
it
be
necessary
,
I
will
make
him
*NL*
go
behind

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

asked
*NL*
Don

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
,

answered
Sancho
.
``
Years
ago
I
was
for
a
month
at
the
*NL*
capital
and
there
I
saw
taking
the
air
a
very
small
gentleman
who
they
*NL*
said
was
a
very
great
man
,
and
a
man
following
him
on
horseback
in
every
*NL*
turn
he
took
,
just
as
if
he
was
his
tail
.
I
asked
why
this
man
did
not
*NL*
join
the
other
man
,
instead
of
always
going
behind
him
;
they
answered
me
*NL*
that
he
was
his
equerry
,
and
that
it
was
the
custom
with
nobles
to
have
*NL*
such
persons
behind
them
,
and
ever
since
then
I
know
it
,
for
I
have
never
*NL*
forgotten
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
right
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
in
the
same
way
thou
mayest
*NL*
carry
thy
barber
with
thee
,
for
customs
did
not
come
into
use
all
*NL*
together
,
nor
were
they
all
invented
at
once
,
and
thou
mayest
be
the
*NL*
first
count
to
have
a
barber
to
follow
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
shaving
one
's
*NL*
beard
is
a
greater
trust
than
saddling
one
's
horse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
barber
business
be
my
look-out

Sancho

So

OF
THE
FREEDOM
DON

CONFERRED
ON
SEVERAL
UNFORTUNATES

AGAINST

THEIR
WILL
WERE
BEING
CARRIED
WHERE
THEY
HAD
NO
WISH
TO
GO
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
,
the
Arab
and
Manchegan
author
,
relates
in
this
*NL*
most
grave
,
high-sounding
,
minute
,
delightful
,
and
original
history
that
*NL*
after
the
discussion
between
the
famous
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
and
his
*NL*
squire
Sancho
Panza
which
is
set
down
at
the
end
of
chapter
twenty-one
,
*NL*
Don
Quixote
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
coming
along
the
road
he
was
*NL*
following
some
dozen
men
on
foot
strung
together
by
the
neck
,
like
beads
,
*NL*
on
a
great
iron
chain
,
and
all
with
manacles
on
their
hands
.
With
them
*NL*
there
came
also
two
men
on
horseback
and
two
on
foot
;
those
on
horseback
*NL*
with
wheel-lock
muskets
,
those
on
foot
with
javelins
and
swords
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
Sancho
saw
them
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
chain
of
galley
slaves
,
on
the
way
to
the
galleys
by
force
of
*NL*
the
king
's
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
by
force
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
;
``
is
it
possible
that
the
king
uses
*NL*
force
against
anyone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
say
that
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
but
that
these
are
people
*NL*
condemned
for
their
crimes
to
serve
by
force
in
the
king
's
galleys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
fact
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
however
it
may
be
,
these
people
are
*NL*
going
where
they
are
taking
them
by
force
,
and
not
of
their
own
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
if
so
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
here
is
a
case
for
the
exercise
of
my
*NL*
office
,
to
put
down
force
and
to
succour
and
help
the
wretched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Recollect
,
your
worship
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
Justice
,
which
is
the
king
*NL*
himself
,
is
not
using
force
or
doing
wrong
to
such
persons
,

punishing
*NL*
them
for
their
crimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chain
of
galley
slaves
had
by
this
time
come
up
,
and
Don
Quixote
in
*NL*
very
courteous
language
asked
those
who
were
in
custody
of
it
to
be
good
*NL*
enough
to
tell
him
the
reason
or
reasons
for
which
they
were
conducting
*NL*
these
people
in
this
manner
.
One
of
the
guards
on
horseback
answered
that
*NL*
they
were
galley
slaves
belonging
to
his
majesty
,
that
they
were
going
to
*NL*
the
galleys
,
and
that
was
all
that
was
to
be
said
and
all
he
had
any
*NL*
business
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
should
like
to
know
from
each
of
*NL*
them
separately
the
reason
of
his
misfortune
;
''
to
this
he
added
more
to
*NL*
the
same
effect
to
induce
them
to
tell
him
what
he
wanted
so
civilly
that
*NL*
the
other
mounted
guard
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
we
have
here
the
register
and
certificate
of
the
sentence
of
*NL*
every
one
of
these
wretches
,
this
is
no
time
to
take
them
out
or
read
*NL*
them
;
come
and
ask
themselves
;
they
can
tell
if
they
choose
,
and
they
*NL*
will
,
for
these
fellows
take
a
pleasure
in
doing
and
talking
about
*NL*
rascalities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
permission
,
which
Don
Quixote
would
have
taken
even
had
they
*NL*
not
granted
it
,
he
approached
the
chain
and
asked
the
first
for
what
*NL*
offences
he
was
now
in
such
a
sorry
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
answer
that
it
was
for
being
a
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
that
only
?
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
why
,
if
for
being
lovers
they
send
*NL*
people
to
the
galleys
I
might
have
been
rowing
in
them
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
love
is
not
the
sort
your
worship
is
thinking
of
,
''
said
the
galley
*NL*
slave
;
``
mine
was
that
I
loved
a
washerwoman
's
basket
of
clean
linen
so
*NL*
well
,
and
held
it
so
close
in
my
embrace
,
that
if
the
arm
of
the
law
had
*NL*
not
forced
it
from
me
,
I
should
never
have
let
it
go
of
my
own
will
to
*NL*
this
moment
;
I
was
caught
in
the
act

there
was
no
occasion
for
torture

*NL*
the
case
was
settled

they
treated
me
to
a
hundred
lashes

the
back
,
*NL*
and
three
years
of
gurapas
besides
,
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
gurapas
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gurapas
are
galleys
,
''
answered
the
galley
slave
,
who
was
a
young
man
of
*NL*
about
four-and-twenty
,
and
said
he
was
a
native
of
Piedrahita
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
asked
the
same
question
of
the
second
,
who
made
no
reply
,
so
*NL*
downcast
and
melancholy
was
he
;
but
the
first
answered
for
him
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
He
,
sir
,
goes
as
a
canary
,
I
mean
as
a
musician
and
a
singer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
being
musicians
and
singers
are
people
*NL*
sent
to
the
galleys
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
galley
slave
,
``
for
there
is
nothing
worse
than
*NL*
singing
under
suffering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
have
heard
say
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
he
who
sings
*NL*
scares
away
his
woes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
the
reverse
,
''
said
the
galley
slave
;
``
for
he
who
sings
once
*NL*
weeps
all
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
but
one
of
the
guards
said
to
*NL*
him
,
``
Sir
,
to
sing
under
suffering
means
with
the
non
sancta
fraternity
*NL*
to
confess
under
torture
;
they
put
this
sinner
to
the
torture
and
he
*NL*
confessed
his
crime
,
which
was
being
a
cuatrero
,
that
is
a
*NL*
cattle-stealer
,
and
on
his
confession
they
sentenced
him
to
six
years
in
*NL*
the
galleys
,
besides
two
bundred
lashes
that
he
has
already
had
on
the
*NL*
back
;
and
he
is
always
dejected
and
downcast
because
the
other
thieves
*NL*
that
were
left
behind
and
that
march
here
ill-treat
,
and
snub
,
and
jeer
,
*NL*
and
despise
him
for
confessing
and
not
having
spirit
enough
to
say
nay
;
*NL*
for
,
say
they
,
`
nay
'
has
no
more
letters
in
it
than
`
yea
,
'
and
a
culprit
*NL*
is
well
off
when
life
or
death
with
him
depends
on
his
own
tongue
and
not
*NL*
on
that
of
witnesses
or
evidence
;
and
to
my
thinking
they
are
not
very
*NL*
far
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
think
so
too
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
;
then
passing
on
to
the
third
*NL*
he
asked
him
what
he
had
asked
the
others
,
and
the
man
answered
very
*NL*
readily
and
unconcernedly
,
``
I
am
going
for
five
years
to
their
ladyships
*NL*
the
gurapas
for
the
want
of
ten
ducats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
give
twenty
with
pleasure
to
get
you
out
of
that
trouble
,
''
said
*NL*
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
the
galley
slave
,
``
is
like
a
man
having
money
at
sea
when
he
*NL*
is
dying
of
hunger
and
has
no
way
of
buying
what
he
wants
;
I
say
so
*NL*
because
if
at
the
right
time
I
had
had
those
twenty
ducats
that
your
*NL*
worship
now
offers
me
,
I
would
have
greased
the
notary
's
pen
and
*NL*
freshened
up
the
attorney
's
wit
with
them
,
so
that
to-day
I
should
be
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
plaza
of
the
Zocodover
at
Toledo
,
and
not
on
this
road
*NL*
coupled
like
a
greyhound
.
But
God
is
great
;
patience
--
there
,
that
's
*NL*
enough
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
passed
on
to
the
fourth
,
a
man
of
venerable
aspect
with
a
*NL*
white
beard
falling
below
his
breast
,
who
on
hearing
himself
asked
the
*NL*
reason
of
his
being
there
began
to
weep
without
answering
a
word
,
but
the
*NL*
fifth
acted
as
his
tongue
and
said
,
``
This
worthy
man
is
going
to
the
*NL*
galleys
for
four
years
,
after
having
gone
the
rounds
in
ceremony
and
on
*NL*
horseback
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
means
,
''
said
Sancho
Panza
,
``
as
I
take
it
,
to
have
been
exposed
to
*NL*
shame
in
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
replied
the
galley
slave
,
``
and
the
offence
for
which
they
gave
*NL*
him
that
punishment
was
having
been
an
ear-broker
,
nay
body-broker
;
I
*NL*
mean
,
in
short
,
that
this
gentleman
goes
as
a
pimp
,
and
for
having
*NL*
besides
a
certain
touch
of
the
sorcerer
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
touch
had
not
been
thrown
in
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
he
would
not
*NL*
deserve
,
for
mere
pimping
,
to
row
in
the
galleys
,
but
rather
to
command
*NL*
and
be
admiral
of
them
;
for
the
office
of
pimp
is
no
ordinary
one
,
being
*NL*
the
office
of
persons
of
discretion
,
one
very
necessary
in
a
well-ordered
*NL*
state
,
and
only
to
be
exercised
by
persons
of
good
birth
;
nay
,
there
*NL*
ought
to
be
an
inspector
and
overseer
of
them
,
as
in
other
offices
,
and
*NL*
recognised
number
,
as
with
the
brokers
on
change
;
in
this
way
many
of
the
*NL*
evils
would
be
avoided
which
are
caused
by
this
office
and
calling
being
*NL*
in
the
hands
of
stupid
and
ignorant
people
,
such
as
women
more
or
less
*NL*
silly
,
and
pages
and
jesters
of
little
standing
and
experience
,
who
on
*NL*
the
most
urgent
occasions
,
and
when
ingenuity
of
contrivance
is
needed
,
*NL*
let
the
crumbs
freeze
on
the
way
to
their
mouths
,
and
know
not
which
is
*NL*
their
right
hand
.
I
should
like
to
go
farther
,
and
give
reasons
to
show
*NL*
that
it
is
advisable
to
choose
those
who
are
to
hold
so
necessary
an
*NL*
office
in
the
state
,
but
this
is
not
the
fit
place
for
it
;
some
day
I
*NL*
will
expound
the
matter
to
some
one
able
to
see
to
and
rectify
it
;
all
I
*NL*
say
now
is
,
that
the
additional
fact
of
his
being
a
sorcerer
has
removed
*NL*
the
sorrow
it
gave
me
to
see
these
white
hairs
and
this
venerable
*NL*
countenance
in
so
painful
a
position
on
account
of
his
being
a
pimp
;
*NL*
though
I
know
well
there
are
no
sorceries
in
the
world
that
can
move
or
*NL*
compel
the
will
as
some
simple
folk
fancy
,
for
our
will
is
free
,
nor
is
*NL*
there
herb
or
charm
that
can
force
it
.
All
that
certain
silly
women
and
*NL*
quacks
do
is
to
turn
men
mad
with
potions
and
poisons
,
pretending
that
*NL*
they
have
power
to
cause
love
,
for
,
as
I
say
,
it
is
an
impossibility
to
*NL*
compel
the
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
the
good
old
man
,
``
and
indeed
,
sir
,
as
far
as
the
*NL*
charge
of
sorcery
goes
I
was
not
guilty
;
as
to
that
of
being
a
pimp
I
*NL*
can
not
deny
it
;
but
I
never
thought
I
was
doing
any
harm
by
it
,
for
my
*NL*
only
object
was
that
all
the
world
should
enjoy
itself
and
live
in
peace
*NL*
and
quiet
,
without
quarrels
or
troubles
;
but
my
good
intentions
were
*NL*
unavailing
to
save
me
from
going
where
I
never
expect
to
come
back
from
,
*NL*
with
this
weight
of
years
upon
me
and
a
urinary
ailment
that
never
gives
*NL*
me
a
moment
's
ease
;
''
and
again
he
fell
to
weeping
as
before
,
and
such
*NL*
compassion
did
Sancho
feel
for
him
that
he
took
out
a
real
of
four
from
*NL*
his
bosom
and
gave
it
to
him
in
alms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
went
on
and
asked
another
what
his
crime
was
,
and
the
man
*NL*
answered
with
no
less
but
rather
much
more
sprightliness
than
the
last
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
because
I
carried
the
joke
too
far
with
a
couple
of
cousins
of
*NL*
mine
,
and
with
a
couple
of
other
cousins
who
were
none
of
mine
;
in
short
,
*NL*
I
carried
the
joke
so
far
with
them
all
that
it
ended
in
such
a
*NL*
complicated
increase
of
kindred
that
no
accountant
could
make
it
clear
:
*NL*
it
was
all
proved
against
me
,
I
got
no
favour
,
I
had
no
money
,
I
was
near
*NL*
having
my
neck
stretched
,
they
sentenced
me
to
the
galleys
for
six
years
,
*NL*
I
accepted
my
fate
,
it
is
the
punishment
of
my
fault
;
I
am
a
young
man
;
*NL*
let
life
only
last
,
and
with
that
all
will
come
right
.
If
you
,
sir
,
have
*NL*
anything
wherewith
to
help
the
poor
,
God
will
repay
it
to
you
in
heaven
,
*NL*
and
we
on
earth
will
take
care
in
our
petitions
to
him
to
pray
for
the
*NL*
life
and
health
of
your
worship
,
that
they
may
be
as
long
and
as
good
as
*NL*
your
amiable
appearance
deserves

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
one
was
in
the
dress
of
a
student
,
and
one
of
the
guards
said
he
was
*NL*
a
great
talker
and
a
very
elegant
Latin
scholar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
all
these
there
came
a
man
of
thirty
,
a
very
personable
fellow
,
*NL*
except
that
when
he
looked
,
his
eyes
turned
in
a
little
one
towards
the
*NL*
other
.
He
was
bound
differently
from
the
rest
,
for
he
had
to
his
leg
a
*NL*
chain
so
long
that
it
was
wound
all
round
his
body
,
and
two
rings
on
his
*NL*
neck
,
one
attached
to
the
chain
,
the
other
to
what
they
call
a
*NL*
``
keep-friend
''
or
``
friend
's
foot
,
''
from
which
hung
two
irons
reaching
to
*NL*
his
waist
with
two
manacles
fixed
to
them
in
which
his
hands
were
secured
*NL*
by
a
big
padlock
,
so
that
he
could
neither
raise
his
hands
to
his
mouth
*NL*
nor
lower
his
head
to
his
hands
.
Don
Quixote
asked
why
this
man
carried
*NL*
so
many
more
chains
than
the
others
.
The
guard
replied
that
it
was
*NL*
because
he
alone
had
committed
more
crimes
than
all
the
rest
put
*NL*
together
,
and
was
so
daring
and
such
a
villain
,
that
though
they
marched
*NL*
him
in
that
fashion
they
did
not
feel
sure
of
him
,
but
were
in
dread
of
*NL*
his
making
his
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
crimes
can
he
have
committed
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
they
have
not
*NL*
deserved
a
heavier
punishment
than
being
sent
to
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
goes
for
ten
years

replied
the
guard
,
``
which
is
the
same
thing

civil

all

,
for
there
I
shall
have
time
to
finish
my
book
;
I
have
still
many
*NL*
things
left
to
say
,
and
in
the
galleys
of
Spain
there
is
more
than
enough
*NL*
leisure
;
though
I
do
not
want
much
for
what
I
have
to
write
,
for
I
have
*NL*
it
by
heart
.

*NL*
``
You
seem
a
clever
fellow
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
an
unfortunate
one
,
''
replied
Gines
,
``
for
misfortune
always
*NL*
persecutes
good
wit

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
persecutes

said
the
commissary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
already
to
go
gently
,
master
commissary
,
''
said
Pasamonte
;
*NL*
``
their
lordships
yonder
never
gave
you
that
staff
to
ill-treat
us
*NL*
wretches
here
,
but
to
conduct
and
take
us
where
his
majesty
orders
you
;

if
not
,
by
the
life
of-never
mind

;
it
may
be
that
some
day
the
stains
*NL*
made
in
the
inn
will
come
out
in
the
scouring
;
let
everyone
hold
his
*NL*
tongue
and
behave
well
and
speak
better
;
and
now
let
us
march
on
,
for
we
*NL*
have
had
quite
enough
of
this
entertainment

*NL*
*NL*
The
commissary
lifted
his
staff
to
strike
Pasamonte
in
return
for
his
*NL*
threats
,
but
Don
Quixote
came
between
them
,
and
begged
him
not
to
ill-use
*NL*
him
,
as
it
was
not
too
much
to
allow
one
who
had
his
hands
tied
to
have
*NL*
his
tongue
a
trifle
free
;
and
turning
to
the
whole
chain
of
them
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
all
you
have
told
me
,
dear
brethren
,
make
out
clearly
that
though
*NL*
they
have
punished
you
for
your
faults
,
the
punishments
you
are
about
to
*NL*
endure
do
not
give
you
much
pleasure
,
and
that
you
go
to
them
very
much
*NL*
against
the
grain
and
against
your
will
,
and
that
perhaps
this
one
's
want
*NL*
of
courage
under
torture
,
that
one
's
want
of
money
,
the
other
's
want
of
*NL*
advocacy
,
and
lastly
the
perverted
judgment
of
the
judge
may
have
been
*NL*
the
cause
of
your
ruin
and
of
your
failure
to
obtain
the
justice
you
had
*NL*
on
your
side
.
All
which
presents
itself
now
to
my
mind
,
urging
,
*NL*
persuading
,
and
even
compelling
me
to
demonstrate
in
your
case
the
*NL*
purpose
for
which
Heaven
sent
me
into
the
world
and
caused
me
to
make
*NL*
profession
of
the
order
of
chivalry
to
which
I
belong
,
and
the
vow
I
took
*NL*
therein
to
give
aid
to
those
in
need
and
under
the
oppression
of
the
*NL*
strong
.
But
as
I
know
that
it
is
a
mark
of
prudence
not
to
do
by
foul
*NL*
means
what
may
be
done
by
fair
,
I
will
ask
these
gentlemen
,
the
guards
*NL*
and
commissary
,
to
be
so
good
as
to
release
you
and
let
you
go
in
peace
,
*NL*
as
there
will
be
no
lack
of
others
to
serve
the
king
under
more
*NL*
favourable
circumstances
;
for
it
seems
to
me
a
hard
case
to
make
slaves
*NL*
of
those
whom
God
and
nature
have
made
free
.
Moreover
,
sirs
of
the
*NL*
guard
,
''
added
Don
Quixote
,
``
these
poor
fellows
have
done
nothing
to
you
;
*NL*
let
each
answer
for
his
own
sins
yonder
;
there
is
a
God
in
Heaven
who
*NL*
will
not
forget
to
punish
the
wicked
or
reward
the
good
;
and
it
is
not
*NL*
fitting
that
honest
men
should
be
the
instruments
of
punishment
to
*NL*
others
,
they
being
therein
no
way
concerned
.
This
request
I
make
thus
*NL*
gently
and
quietly
,
that
,
if
you
comply
with
it
,
I
may
have
reason
for
*NL*
thanking
you
;
and
,
if
you
will
not
voluntarily
,
this
lance
and
sword
*NL*
together
with
the
might
of
my
arm
shall
compel
you
to
comply
with
it
by
*NL*
force
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nice
nonsense
!
''
said
the
commissary
;
``
a
fine
piece
of
pleasantry
he
has
*NL*
come
out
with
at
last
!
He
wants
us
to
let
the
king
's
prisoners
go
,
as
if
*NL*
we
had
any
authority
to
release
them
,
or
he
to
order
us
to
do
so
!
Go
your
*NL*
way
,
sir
,
and
good
luck
to
you
;
put
that
basin
straight
that
you
've
got
*NL*
on
your
head
,
and
do
n't
go
looking
for
three
feet
on
a
cat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
you
that
are
the
cat
,
rat
,
and
rascal
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
and
*NL*
acting
on
the
word
he
fell
upon
him
so
suddenly
that
without
giving
him
*NL*
time
to
defend
himself
he
brought
him
to
the
ground
sorely
wounded
with
a
*NL*
lance-thrust
;
and
lucky
it
was
for
him
that
it
was
the
one
that
had
the
*NL*
musket
.
The
other
guards
stood
thunderstruck
and
amazed
at
this
*NL*
unexpected
event
,
but
recovering
presence
of
mind
,
those
on
horseback
*NL*
seized
their
swords
,
and
those
on
foot
their
javelins
,
and
attacked
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
was
waiting
for
them
with
great
calmness
;
and
no
doubt
it
*NL*
would
have
gone
badly
with
him
if
the
galley
slaves
,
seeing
the
chance
*NL*
before
them
of
liberating
themselves
,
had
not
effected
it
by
contriving
*NL*
to
break
the
chain
on
which
they
were
strung
.
Such
was
the
confusion
,
*NL*
that
the
guards
,
now
rushing
at
the
galley
slaves
who
were
breaking
*NL*
loose
,
now
to
attack
Don
Quixote
who
was
waiting
for
them
,
did
nothing
at
*NL*
all
that
was
of
any
use
.
Sancho
,
on
his
part
,
gave
a
helping
hand
to
*NL*
release
Gines
de
Pasamonte
,
who
was
the
first
to
leap
forth
upon
the
*NL*
plain
free
and
unfettered
,
and
who
,
attacking
the
prostrate
commissary
,
*NL*
took
from
him
his
sword
and
the
musket
,
with
which
,
aiming
at
one
and
*NL*
levelling
at
another
,
he
,
without
ever
discharging
it
,
drove
every
one
of
*NL*
the
guards
off
the
field
,
for
they
took
to
flight
,
as
well
to
escape
*NL*
Pasamonte
's
musket
,
as
the
showers
of
stones
the
now
released
galley
*NL*
slaves
were
raining
upon
them
.
Sancho
was
greatly
grieved
at
the
affair
,
*NL*
because
he
anticipated
that
those
who
had
fled
would
report
the
matter
to
*NL*
the
Holy
Brotherhood
,
who
at
the
summons
of
the
alarm-bell
would
at
once
*NL*
sally
forth
in
quest
of
the
offenders
;
and
he
said
so
to
his
master
,
and
*NL*
entreated
him
to
leave
the
place
at
once
,
and
go
into
hiding
in
the
*NL*
sierra
that
was
close
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
very
well
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
I
know
what
must
be
done
*NL*
now
;
''
and
calling
together
all
the
galley
slaves
,
who
were
now
running
*NL*
riot
,
and
had
stripped
the
commissary
to
the
skin
,
he
collected
them
*NL*
round
him
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
,
and
addressed
them
as
follows
:
``
To
*NL*
be
grateful
for
benefits
received
is
the
part
of
persons
of
good
birth
,
*NL*
and
one
of
the
sins
most
offensive
to
God
is
ingratitude
;
I
say
so
*NL*
because
,
sirs
,
ye
have
already
seen
by
manifest
proof
the
benefit
ye
have
*NL*
received
of
me
;
in
return
for
which
I
desire
,
and
it
is
my
good
pleasure
*NL*
that
,
laden
with
that
chain
which
I
have
taken
off
your
necks
,
ye
at
once
*NL*
set
out
and
proceed
to
the
city
of
El
Toboso
,
and
there
present
*NL*
yourselves
before
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
and
say
to
her
that
her
*NL*
knight
,
he
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
sends
to
commend
himself
to
her
;
*NL*
and
that
ye
recount
to
her
in
full
detail
all
the
particulars
of
this
*NL*
notable
adventure
,
up
to
the
recovery
of
your
longed-for
liberty
;
and
*NL*
this
done
ye
may
go
where
ye
will
,
and
good
fortune
attend
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gines
de
Pasamonte
made
answer
for
all
,
saying
,
``
That
which
you
,
sir
,
our
*NL*
deliverer
,
demand
of
us
,
is
of
all
impossibilities
the
most
impossible
to
*NL*
comply
with
,
because
we
can
not
go
together
along
the
roads
,
but
only
*NL*
singly
and
separate
,
and
each
one
his
own
way
,
endeavouring
to
hide
*NL*
ourselves
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
to
escape
the
Holy
Brotherhood
,
*NL*
which
,
no
doubt
,
will
come
out
in
search
of
us
.
What
your
worship
may
do
,
*NL*
and
fairly
do
,
is
to
change
this
service
and
tribute
as
regards
the
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
for
a
certain
quantity
of
ave-marias
and
credos
which
*NL*
we
will
say
for
your
worship
's
intention
,
and
this
is
a
condition
that
*NL*
can
be
complied
with
by
night
as
by
day
,
running
or
resting
,
in
peace
or
*NL*
in
war
;
but
to
imagine
that
we
are
going
now
to
return
to
the
flesh-pots
*NL*
of
Egypt
,
I
mean
to
take
up
our
chain
and
set
out
for
El
Toboso
,
is
to
*NL*
imagine
that
it
is
now
night
,
though
it
is
not
yet
ten
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
and
to
ask
this
of
us
is
like
asking
pears
of
the
elm
tree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
by
all
that
's
good
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
-LRB-
now
stirred
to
wrath
-RRB-
,
``
Don
*NL*
son
of
a
bitch
,
Don
Ginesillo
de
Paropillo
,
or
whatever
your
name
is
,
you
*NL*
will
have
to
go
yourself
alone
,
with
your
tail
between
your
legs
and
the
*NL*
whole
chain
on
your
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pasamonte
,
who
was
anything
but
meek
-LRB-
being
by
this
time
thoroughly
*NL*
convinced
that
Don
Quixote
was
not
quite
right
in
his
head
as
he
had
*NL*
committed
such
a
vagary
as
to
set
them
free
-RRB-
,
finding
himself
abused
in
*NL*
this
fashion
,
gave
the
wink
to
his
companions
,
and
falling
back
they
*NL*
began
to
shower
stones
on
Don
Quixote
at
such
a
rate
that
he
was
quite
*NL*
unable
to
protect
himself
with
his
buckler
,
and
poor
Rocinante
no
more
*NL*
heeded
the
spur
than
if
he
had
been
made
of
brass
.
Sancho
planted
himself
*NL*
behind
his
ass
,
and
with
him
sheltered
himself
from
the
hailstorm
that
*NL*
poured
on
both
of
them
.
Don
Quixote
was
unable
to
shield
himself
so
well
*NL*
but
that
more
pebbles
than
I
could
count
struck
him
full
on
the
body
with
*NL*
such
force
that
they
brought
him
to
the
ground
;
and
the
instant
he
fell
*NL*
the
student
pounced
upon
him
,
snatched
the
basin
from
his
head
,
and
with
*NL*
it
struck
three
or
four
blows
on
his
shoulders
,
and
as
many
more
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
knocking
it
almost
to
pieces
.
They
then
stripped
him
of
a
jacket
*NL*
that
he
wore
over
his
armour
,
and
they
would
have
stripped
off
his
*NL*
stockings
if
his
greaves
had
not
prevented
them
.
From
Sancho
they
took
*NL*
his
coat
,
leaving
him
in
his
shirt-sleeves
;
and
dividing
among
themselves
*NL*
the
remaining
spoils
of
the
battle
,
they
went
each
one
his
own
way
,
more
*NL*
solicitous
about
keeping
clear
of
the
Holy
Brotherhood
they
dreaded
,
than
*NL*
about
burdening
themselves
with
the
chain
,
or
going
to
present
themselves
*NL*
before
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
.
The
ass
and
Rocinante
,
Sancho
and
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
were
all
that
were
left
upon
the
spot
;
the
ass
with
drooping
*NL*
head
,
serious
,
shaking
his
ears
from
time
to
time
as
if
he
thought
the
*NL*
storm
of
stones
that
assailed
them
was
not
yet
over
;
Rocinante
stretched
*NL*
beside
his
master
,
for
he
too
had
been
brought
to
the
ground
by
a
stone
;
*NL*
Sancho
stripped
,
and
trembling
with
fear
of
the
Holy
Brotherhood
;
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
fuming
to
find
himself
so
served
by
the
very
persons
for

done
so
much

CHAPTER
XXIII

*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
BEFELL
DON
QUIXOTE
IN
THE
SIERRA
MORENA
,
WHICH
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
*NL*
RAREST
ADVENTURES
RELATED
IN
THIS
VERACIOUS
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
himself
served
in
this
way
,
Don
Quixote
said
to
his
squire
,
``
I
*NL*
have
always
heard
it
said
,
Sancho
,
that
to
do
good
to
boors
is
to
throw
*NL*
water
into
the
sea
.
If
I
had
believed
thy
words
,
I
should
have
avoided
*NL*
this
trouble
;
but
it
is
done
now
,
it
is
only
to
have
patience
and
take
*NL*
warning
for
the
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
will
take
warning
as
much
as
I
am
a
Turk
,
''
returned
Sancho
;
*NL*
``
but
,
as
you
say
this
mischief
might
have
been
avoided
if
you
had
*NL*
believed
me
,
believe
me
now
,
and
a
still
greater
one
will
be
avoided
;
for
*NL*
I
tell
you
chivalry
is
of
no
account
with
the
Holy
Brotherhood
,
and
they
*NL*
do
n't
care
two
maravedis
for
all
the
knights-errant
in
the
world
;
and
I
*NL*
can
tell
you
I
fancy
I
hear
their
arrows
whistling
past
my
ears
this
*NL*
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
a
coward
by
nature
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
lest
thou
*NL*
shouldst
say
I
am
obstinate
,
and
that
I
never
do
as
thou
dost
advise
,
*NL*
this
once
I
will
take
thy
advice
,
and
withdraw
out
of
reach
of
that
fury
*NL*
thou
so
dreadest
;
but
it
must
be
on
one
condition
,
that
never
,
in
life
or
*NL*
in
death
,
thou
art
to
say
to
anyone
that
I
retired
or
withdrew
from
this
*NL*
danger
out
of
fear
,
but
only
in
compliance
with
thy
entreaties
;
for
if
*NL*
thou
sayest
otherwise
thou
wilt
lie
therein
,

from
this
time
to
that

from

I
give
thee
lie

thou
liest

lie

every

thou

me
not
again

*NL*
the
mere
thought
that

am
withdrawing

retiring
from
any
danger
,
above
*NL*
all
from
this
,
which
does
seem
to
carry
some
little
shadow
of
fear
with
*NL*
it
,
I
am
ready
to
take
my
stand
here
and
await
alone
,
not
only
that
Holy
*NL*
Brotherhood
you
talk
of
and
dread
,
but
the
brothers
of
the
twelve
tribes
*NL*
of
Israel
,
and
the
Seven
Maccabees
,
and
Castor
and
Pollux
,
and
all
the
*NL*
brothers
and
brotherhoods
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
to
retire
is
not
to
flee
,
and
there
is
no
*NL*
wisdom
in
waiting
when
danger
outweighs
hope
,
and
it
is
the
part
of
wise
*NL*
men
to
preserve
themselves
to-day
for
to-morrow
,
and
not
risk
all
in
one
*NL*
day
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
though
I
am
a
clown
and
a
boor
,
I
have
got
some
*NL*
notion
of
what
they
call
safe
conduct
;
so
repent
not
of
having
taken
my
*NL*
advice
,
but
mount
Rocinante
if
you
can
,
and
if
not
I
will
help
you
;
and
*NL*
follow
me
,
for
my
mother-wit
tells
me
we
have
more
need
of
legs
than
*NL*
hands
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
mounted
without
replying
,
and
,
Sancho
leading
the
way
on
his
*NL*
ass
,
they
entered
the
side
of
the
Sierra
Morena
,
which
was
close
by
,
as
*NL*
it
was
Sancho
's
design
to
cross
it
entirely
and
come
out
again
at
El
Viso
*NL*
or
Almodovar
del
Campo
,
and
hide
for
some
days
among
its
crags
so
as
to
*NL*
escape
the
search
of
the
Brotherhood
should
they
come
to
look
for
them
.
*NL*
He
was
encouraged
in
this
by
perceiving
that
the
stock
of
provisions
*NL*
carried
by
the
ass
had
come
safe
out
of
the
fray
with
the
galley
slaves
,
*NL*
a
circumstance
that
he
regarded
as
a
miracle
,
seeing
how
they
pillaged
*NL*
and
ransacked
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
they
reached
the
very
heart
of
the
Sierra
Morena
,
where
it
*NL*
seemed
prudent
to
Sancho
to
pass
the
night
and
even
some
days
,
at
least
*NL*
as
many
as
the
stores
he
carried
might
last
,
and
so
they
encamped
between
*NL*
two
rocks
and
among
some
cork
trees
;
but
fatal
destiny
,
which
,
according
*NL*
to
the
opinion
of
those
who
have
not
the
light
of
the
true
faith
,
*NL*
directs
,
arranges
,
and
settles
everything
in
its
own
way
,
so
ordered
it
*NL*
that
Gines
de
Pasamonte
,
the
famous
knave
and
thief
who
by
the
virtue
and
*NL*
madness
of
Don
Quixote
had
been
released
from
the
chain
,
driven
by
fear
*NL*
of
the
Holy
Brotherhood
,
which
he
had
good
reason
to
dread
,
resolved
to
*NL*
take
hiding
in
the
mountains
;
and
his
fate
and
fear
led
him
to
the
same
*NL*
spot
to
which
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
Panza
had
been
led
by
theirs
,
just
*NL*
in
time
to
recognise
them
and
leave
them
to
fall
asleep
:
and
as
the
*NL*
wicked
are
always
ungrateful
,
and
necessity
leads
to
evildoing
,
and
*NL*
immediate
advantage
overcomes
all
considerations
of
the
future
,
Gines
,
*NL*
who
was
neither
grateful
nor
well-principled
,
made
up
his
mind
to
steal
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
's
ass
,
not
troubling
himself
about
Rocinante
,
as
being
a
*NL*
prize
that
was
no
good
either
to
pledge
or
sell
.
While
Sancho
slept
he
*NL*
stole
his
ass
,
and
before
day
dawned
he
was
far
out
of
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aurora
made
her
appearance
bringing
gladness
to
the
earth
but
sadness
to
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
,
for
he
found
that
his
Dapple
was
missing
,
and
seeing
*NL*
himself
bereft
of
him
he
began
the
saddest
and
most
doleful
lament
in
the
*NL*
world
,
so
loud
that
Don
Quixote
awoke
at
his
exclamations
and
heard
him
*NL*
saying
,
``
O
son
of
my
bowels
,
born
in
my
very
house
,
my
children
's
*NL*
plaything
,
my
wife
's
joy
,
the
envy
of
my
neighbours
,
relief
of
my
*NL*
burdens
,
and
lastly
,
half
supporter
of
myself
,
for
with
the
*NL*
six-and-twenty
maravedis
thou
didst
earn
me
daily
I
met
half
my
charges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
when
he
heard
the
lament
and
learned
the
cause
,
consoled
*NL*
Sancho
with
the
best
arguments
he
could
,
entreating
him
to
be
patient
,
*NL*
and
promising
to
give
him
a
letter
of
exchange
ordering
three
out
of
five
*NL*
ass-colts
that
he
had
at
home
to
be
given
to
him
.
Sancho
took
comfort
at
*NL*
this
,
dried
his
tears
,
suppressed
his
sobs
,
and
returned
thanks
for
the
*NL*
kindness
shown
him
by
Don
Quixote
.
He
on
his
part
was
rejoiced
to
the
*NL*
heart
on
entering
the
mountains
,
as
they
seemed
to
him
to
be
just
the
*NL*
place
for
the
adventures
he
was
in
quest
of
.
They
brought
back
to
his
*NL*
memory
the
marvellous
adventures
that
had
befallen
knights-errant
in
like
*NL*
solitudes
and
wilds
,
and
he
went
along
reflecting
on
these
things
,
so
*NL*
absorbed
and
carried
away
by
them
that
he
had
no
thought
for
anything
*NL*
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
had
Sancho
any
other
care
-LRB-
now
that
he
fancied
he
was
travelling
in
a
*NL*
safe
quarter
-RRB-
than
to
satisfy
his
appetite
with
such
remains
as
were
left
*NL*
of
the
clerical
spoils
,
and
so
he
marched
behind
his
master
laden
with
*NL*
what
Dapple
used
to
carry
,
emptying
the
sack
and
packing
his
paunch
,
and
*NL*
so
long
as
he
could
go
that
way
,
he
would
not
have
given
a
farthing
to
*NL*
meet
with
another
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
so
engaged
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
that
his
master
had
halted
,
*NL*
and
was
trying
with
the
point
of
his
pike
to
lift
some
bulky
object
that
*NL*
lay
upon
the
ground
,
on
which
he
hastened
to
join
him
and
help
him
if
it
*NL*
were
needful
,
and
reached
him
just
as
with
the
point
of
the
pike
he
was
*NL*
raising
a
saddle-pad
with
a
valise
attached
to
it
,
half
or
rather
wholly
*NL*
rotten
and
torn
;
but
so
heavy
were
they
that
Sancho
had
to
help
to
take
*NL*
them
up
,
and
his
master
directed
him
to
see
what
the
valise
contained
.
*NL*
Sancho
did
so
with
great
alacrity
,
and
though
the
valise
was
secured
by
a
*NL*
chain
and
padlock
,
from
its
torn
and
rotten
condition
he
was
able
to
see
*NL*
its
contents
,
which
were
four
shirts
of
fine
holland
,
and
other
articles
*NL*
of
linen
no
less
curious
than
clean
;
and
in
a
handkerchief
he
found
a
*NL*
good
lot
of
gold
crowns
,
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
he
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessed
be
all
Heaven
for
sending
us
an
adventure
that
is
good
for
*NL*
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Searching
further
he
found
a
little
memorandum
book
richly
bound
;
this
*NL*
Don
Quixote
asked
of
him
,
telling
him
to
take
the
money
and
keep
it
for
*NL*
himself
.
Sancho
kissed
his
hands
for
the
favour
,
and
cleared
the
valise
*NL*
of
its
linen
,
which
he
stowed
away
in
the
provision
sack
.
Considering
the
*NL*
whole
matter
,
Don
Quixote
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
Sancho
--
and
it
is
impossible
it
can
be
otherwise-that
*NL*
some
strayed
traveller
must
have
crossed
this
sierra
and
been
attacked
*NL*
and
slain
by
footpads
,
who
brought
him
to
this
remote
spot
to
bury
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
can
not
be
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
because
if
they
had
been
robbers
they
*NL*
would
not
have
left
this
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
right
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
I
can
not
guess
or
explain
what
*NL*
this
may
mean
;
but
stay
;
let
us
see
if
in
this
memorandum
book
there
is
*NL*
anything
written
by
which
we
may
be
able
to
trace
out
or
discover
what
we
*NL*
want
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
it
,
and
the
first
thing
he
found
in
it
,
written
roughly
but
in
*NL*
a
very
good
hand
,
was
a
sonnet
,
and
reading
it
aloud
that
Sancho
might
*NL*
hear
it
,
he
found
that
it
ran
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
SONNET
*NL*
*NL*
Or
Love
is
lacking
in
intelligence
,
*NL*
Or
to
the
height
of
cruelty
attains
,
*NL*
Or
else
it
is
my
doom
to
suffer
pains
*NL*
Beyond
the
measure
due
to
my
offence
.
*NL*
But
if
Love
be
a
God
,
it
follows
thence
*NL*
That
he
knows
all
,
and
certain
it
remains
*NL*
No
God
loves
cruelty
;
then
who
ordains
*NL*
This
penance
that
enthrals
while
it
torments
?
*NL*
It
were
a
falsehood
,
Chloe
,
thee
to
name
;
*NL*
Such
evil
with
such
goodness
can
not
live
;
*NL*
And
against
Heaven
I
dare
not
charge
the
blame
,
*NL*
I
only
know
it
is
my
fate
to
die
.
*NL*
To
him
who
knows
not
whence
his
malady
*NL*
A
miracle
alone
a
cure
can
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
to
be
learned
from
that
rhyme
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
unless
by
*NL*
that
clue
there
's
in
it
,
one
may
draw
out
the
ball
of
the
whole
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
clue
is
there
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
your
worship
spoke
of
a
clue
in
it
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
said
Chloe
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
that
no
doubt
,
is
the
name
*NL*
of
the
lady
of
whom
the
author
of
the
sonnet
complains
;
and
,
faith
,
he
*NL*
must
be
a
tolerable
poet
,
or
I
know
little
of
the
craft
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
your
worship
understands
rhyming
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
better
than
thou
thinkest
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
as
thou
shalt
see
*NL*
when
thou
carriest
a
letter
written
in
verse
from
beginning
to
end
to
my
*NL*
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
for
I
would
have
thee
know
,
Sancho
,
that
all
or
*NL*
most
of
the
knights-errant
in
days
of
yore
were
great
troubadours
and
*NL*
great
musicians
,
for
both
of
these
accomplishments
,
or
more
properly
*NL*
speaking
gifts
,
are
the
peculiar
property
of
lovers-errant
:
true
it
is
*NL*
that
the
verses
of
the
knights
of
old
have
more
spirit
than
neatness
in
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
more
,
your
worship
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
you
will
find
something
that
*NL*
will
enlighten
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
turned
the
page
and
said
,
``
This
is
prose
and
seems
to
be
a
*NL*
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
correspondence
letter
,
senor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
beginning
it
seems
to
be
a
love
letter
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
your
worship
read
it
aloud
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
I
am
very
fond
*NL*
of
love
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
and
reading
it
aloud
as
Sancho
had
*NL*
requested
him
,
he
found
it
ran
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
Thy
false
promise
and
my
sure
misfortune
carry
me
to
a
place
whence
the
*NL*
news
of
my
death
will
reach
thy
ears
before
the
words
of
my
complaint
.
*NL*
Ungrateful
one
,
thou
hast
rejected
me
for
one
more
wealthy
,
but
not
more
*NL*
worthy
;
but
if
virtue
were
esteemed
wealth
I
should
neither
envy
the
*NL*
fortunes
of
others
nor
weep
for
misfortunes
of
my
own
.
What
thy
beauty
*NL*
raised
up
thy
deeds
have
laid
low
;
by
it
I
believed
thee
to
be
an
angel
,
*NL*
by
them
I
know
thou
art
a
woman
.
Peace
be
with
thee
who
hast
sent
war
to
*NL*
me
,
and
Heaven
grant
that
the
deceit
of
thy
husband
be
ever
hidden
from
*NL*
thee
,
so
that
thou
repent
not
of
what
thou
hast
done
,
and
I
reap
not
a
*NL*
revenge
I
would
not
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
the
letter
,
Don
Quixote
said
,
``
There
is
less
to
be
*NL*
gathered
from
this
than
from
the
verses
,
except
that
he
who
wrote
it
is
*NL*
some
rejected
lover
;
''
and
turning
over
nearly
all
the
pages
of
the
book
*NL*
he
found
more
verses
and
letters
,
some
of
which
he
could
read
,
while
*NL*
others
he
could
not
;
but
they
were
all
made
up
of
complaints
,
laments
,
*NL*
misgivings
,
desires
and
aversions
,
favours
and
rejections
,
some
*NL*
rapturous
,
some
doleful
.
While
Don
Quixote
examined
the
book
,
Sancho
*NL*
examined
the
valise
,
not
leaving
a
corner
in
the
whole
of
it
or
in
the
*NL*
pad
that
he
did
not
search
,
peer
into
,
and
explore
,
or
seam
that
he
did
*NL*
not
rip
,
or
tuft
of
wool
that
he
did
not
pick
to
pieces
,
lest
anything
*NL*
should
escape
for
want
of
care
and
pains
;
so
keen
was
the
covetousness
*NL*
excited
in
him
by
the
discovery
of
the
crowns
,
which
amounted
to
near
a
*NL*
hundred
;
and
though
he
found
no
more
booty
,
he
held
the
blanket
flights
,
*NL*
balsam
vomits
,
stake
benedictions
,
carriers
'
fisticuffs
,
missing
*NL*
alforjas
,
stolen
coat
,
and
all
the
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
weariness
he
had
*NL*
endured
in
the
service
of
his
good
master
,
cheap
at
the
price
;
as
he
*NL*
considered
himself
more
than
fully
indemnified
for
all
by
the
payment
he
*NL*
received
in
the
gift
of
the
treasure-trove
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
was
still
very
anxious
to
find
out
*NL*
who
the
owner
of
the
valise
could
be
,
conjecturing
from
the
sonnet
and
*NL*
letter
,
from
the
money
in
gold
,
and
from
the
fineness
of
the
shirts
,
that
*NL*
he
must
be
some
lover
of
distinction
whom
the
scorn
and
cruelty
of
his
*NL*
lady
had
driven
to
some
desperate
course
;
but
as
in
that
uninhabited
and
*NL*
rugged
spot
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
of
whom
he
could
inquire
,
he
saw
*NL*
nothing
else
for
it
but
to
push
on
,
taking
whatever
road
Rocinante
*NL*
chose
--
which
was
where
he
could
make
his
way
--
firmly
persuaded
that
among
*NL*
these
wilds
he
could
not
fail
to
meet
some
rare
adventure
.
As
he
went
*NL*
along
,
then
,
occupied
with
these
thoughts
,
he
perceived
on
the
summit
of
*NL*
a
height
that
rose
before
their
eyes
a
man
who
went
springing
from
rock
*NL*
to
rock
and
from
tussock
to
tussock
with
marvellous
agility
.
As
well
as
*NL*
he
could
make
out
he
was
unclad
,
with
a
thick
black
beard
,
long
tangled
*NL*
hair
,
and
bare
legs
and
feet
,
his
thighs
were
covered
by
breeches
*NL*
apparently
of
tawny
velvet
but
so
ragged
that
they
showed
his
skin
in
*NL*
several
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
bareheaded
,
and
notwithstanding
the
swiftness
with
which
he
passed
*NL*
as
has
been
described
,
the
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
observed
and
*NL*
noted
all
these
trifles
,
and
though
he
made
the
attempt
,
he
was
unable
to
*NL*
follow
him
,
for
it
was
not
granted
to
the
feebleness
of
Rocinante
to
make
*NL*
way
over
such
rough
ground
,
he
being
,
moreover
,
slow-paced
and
sluggish
*NL*
by
nature
.
Don
Quixote
at
once
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
the
*NL*
owner
of
the
saddle-pad
and
of
the
valise
,
and
made
up
his
mind
to
go
in
*NL*
search
of
him
,
even
though
he
should
have
to
wander
a
year
in
those
*NL*
mountains
before
he
found
him
,
and
so
he
directed
Sancho
to
take
a
short
*NL*
cut
over
one
side
of
the
mountain
,
while
he
himself
went
by
the
other
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
by
this
means
they
might
light
upon
this
man
who
had
passed
*NL*
so
quickly
out
of
their
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
do
that
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
when
I
separate
from
your
*NL*
worship
fear
at
once
lays
hold
of
me
,
and
assails
me
with
all
sorts
of
*NL*
panics
and
fancies
;
and
let
what
I
now
say
be
a
notice
that
from
this
*NL*
time
forth
I
am
not
going
to
stir
a
finger
's
width
from
your
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
so
,
''
said
he
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
``
and
I
am
very
glad
*NL*
that
thou
art
willing
to
rely
on
my
courage
,
which
will
never
fail
thee
,
*NL*
even
though
the
soul
in
thy
body
fail
thee
;
so
come
on
now
behind
me
*NL*
slowly
as
well
as
thou
canst
,
and
make
lanterns
of
thine
eyes
;
let
us
*NL*
make
the
circuit
of
this
ridge
;
perhaps
we
shall
light
upon
this
man
that
*NL*
we
saw
,
who
no
doubt
is
no
other
than
the
owner
of
what
we
found
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
made
answer
,
``
Far
better
would
it
be
not
to
look
for
him
,
*NL*
for
,
if
we
find
him
,
and
he
happens
to
be
the
owner
of
the
money
,
it
is
*NL*
plain
I
must
restore
it
;
it
would
be
better
,
therefore
,
that
without
*NL*
taking
this
needless
trouble
,
I
should
keep
possession
of
it
until
in
*NL*
some
other
less
meddlesome
and
officious
way
the
real
owner
may
be
*NL*
discovered
;
and
perhaps
that
will
be
when
I
shall
have
spent
it
,
and
then
*NL*
the
king
will
hold
me
harmless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
wrong
there
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
now
that
we
have
a
*NL*
suspicion
who
the
owner
is
,
and
have
him
almost
before
us
,
we
are
bound
*NL*
to
seek
him
and
make
restitution
;
and
if
we
do
not
see
him
,
the
strong
*NL*
suspicion
we
have
as
to
his
being
the
owner
makes
us
as
guilty
as
if
he
*NL*
were
so
;
and
so
,
friend
Sancho
,
let
not
our
search
for
him
give
thee
any
*NL*
uneasiness
,
for
if
we
find
him
it
will
relieve
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
saying
he
gave
Rocinante
the
spur
,
and
Sancho
followed
him
on
foot
*NL*
and
loaded
,
and
after
having
partly
made
the
circuit
of
the
mountain
they
*NL*
found
lying
in
a
ravine
,
dead
and
half
devoured
by
dogs
and
pecked
by
*NL*
jackdaws
,
a
mule
saddled
and
bridled
,
all
which
still
further
*NL*
strengthened
their
suspicion
that
he
who
had
fled
was
the
owner
of
the
*NL*
mule
and
the
saddle-pad
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
stood
looking
at
it
they
heard
a
whistle
like
that
of
a
shepherd
*NL*
watching
his
flock
,
and
suddenly
on
their
left
there
appeared
a
great
*NL*
number
of
goats
and
behind
them
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
the
*NL*
goatherd
in
charge
of
them
,
a
man
advanced
in
years
.
Don
Quixote
called
*NL*
aloud
to
him
and
begged
him
to
come
down
to
where
they
stood
.
He
shouted
*NL*
in
return
,
asking
what
had
brought
them
to
that
spot
,
seldom
or
never
*NL*
trodden
except
by
the
feet
of
goats
,
or
of
the
wolves
and
other
wild
*NL*
beasts
that
roamed
around
.
Sancho
in
return
bade
him
come
down
,
and
they
*NL*
would
explain
all
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
goatherd
descended
,
and
reaching
the
place
where
Don
Quixote
stood
,
*NL*
he
said
,
``
I
will
wager
you
are
looking
at
that
hack
mule
that
lies
dead
*NL*
in
the
hollow
there
,
and
,
faith
,
it
has
been
lying
there
now
these
six
*NL*
months
;
tell
me
,
have
you
come
upon
its
master
about
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
come
upon
nobody
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
nor
on
anything
except
*NL*
a
saddle-pad
and
a
little
valise
that
we
found
not
far
from
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
it
too
,
''
said
the
goatherd
,
``
but
I
would
not
lift
it
nor
go
near
*NL*
it
for
fear
of
some
ill-luck
or
being
charged
with
theft
,
for
the
devil
*NL*
is
crafty
,
and
things
rise
up
under
one
's
feet
to
make
one
fall
without
*NL*
knowing
why
or
wherefore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
what
I
say
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
found
it
too
,
and
I
would
*NL*
not
go
within
a
stone
's
throw
of
it
;
there
I
left
it
,
and
there
it
lies
*NL*
just
as
it
was
,
for
I
do
n't
want
a
dog
with
a
bell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
good
man
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
do
you
know
who
is
the
owner
of
*NL*
this
property
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
can
tell
you
,
''
said
the
goatherd
,
``
is
that
about
six
months
ago
,
*NL*
more
or
less
,
there
arrived
at
a
shepherd
's
hut
three
leagues
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
away
from
this
,
a
youth
of
well-bred
appearance
and
manners
,
mounted
on
*NL*
that
same
mule
which
lies
dead
here
,
and
with
the
same
saddle-pad
and
*NL*
valise
which
you
say
you
found
and
did
not
touch
.
He
asked
us
what
part
*NL*
of
this
sierra
was
the
most
rugged
and
retired
;
we
told
him
that
it
was
*NL*
where
we
now
are
;
and
so
in
truth
it
is
,
for
if
you
push
on
half
a
league
*NL*
farther
,
perhaps
you
will
not
be
able
to
find
your
way
out
;
and
I
am
*NL*
wondering
how
you
have
managed
to
come
here
,
for
there
is
no
road
or
path
*NL*
that
leads
to
this
spot
.
I
say
,
then
,
that
on
hearing
our
answer
the
*NL*
youth
turned
about
and
made
for
the
place
we
pointed
out
to
him
,
leaving
*NL*
us
all
charmed
with
his
good
looks
,
and
wondering
at
his
question
and
the
*NL*
haste
with
which
we
saw
him
depart
in
the
direction
of
the
sierra
;
and
*NL*
after
that
we
saw
him
no
more
,
until
some
days
afterwards
he
crossed
the
*NL*
path
of
one
of
our
shepherds
,
and
without
saying
a
word
to
him
,
came
up
*NL*
to
him
and
gave
him
several
cuffs
and
kicks
,
and
then
turned
to
the
ass
*NL*
with
our
provisions
and
took
all
the
bread
and
cheese
it
carried
,
and
*NL*
having
done
this
made
off
back
again
into
the
sierra
with
extraordinary
*NL*
swiftness
.
When
some
of
us
goatherds
learned
this
we
went
in
search
of
*NL*
him
for
about
two
days
through
the
most
remote
portion
of
this
sierra
,
at
*NL*
the
end
of
which
we
found
him
lodged
in
the
hollow
of
a
large
thick
cork
*NL*
tree
.
He
came
out
to
meet
us
with
great
gentleness
,
with
his
dress
now
*NL*
torn
and
his
face
so
disfigured
and
burned
by
the
sun
,
that
we
hardly
*NL*
recognised
him
but
that
his
clothes
,
though
torn
,
convinced
us
,
from
the
*NL*
recollection
we
had
of
them
,
that
he
was
the
person
we
were
looking
for
.
*NL*
He
saluted
us
courteously
,
and
in
a
few
well-spoken
words
he
told
us
not
*NL*
to
wonder
at
seeing
him
going
about
in
this
guise
,
as
it
was
binding
upon
*NL*
him
in
order
that
he
might
work
out
a
penance
which
for
his
many
sins
had
*NL*
been
imposed
upon
him
.
We
asked
him
to
tell
us
who
he
was
,
but
we
were
*NL*
never
able
to
find
out
from
him
:
we
begged
of
him
too
,
when
he
was
in
*NL*
want
of
food
,
which
he
could
not
do
without
,
to
tell
us
where
we
should
*NL*
find
him
,
as
we
would
bring
it
to
him
with
all
good-will
and
readiness
;
*NL*
or
if
this
were
not
to
his
taste
,
at
least
to
come
and
ask
it
of
us
and
*NL*
not
take
it
by
force
from
the
shepherds
.
He
thanked
us
for
the
offer
,
*NL*
begged
pardon
for
the
late
assault
,
and
promised
for
the
future
to
ask
it
*NL*
in
God
's
name
without
offering
violence
to
anybody
.
As
for
fixed
abode
,
*NL*
he
said
he
had
no
other
than
that
which
chance
offered
wherever
night
*NL*
might
overtake
him
;
and
his
words
ended
in
an
outburst
of
weeping
so
*NL*
bitter
that
we
who
listened
to
him
must
have
been
very
stones
had
we
not
*NL*
joined
him
in
it
,
comparing
what
we
saw
of
him
the
first
time
with
what
*NL*
we
saw
now
;
for
,
as
I
said
,
he
was
a
graceful
and
gracious
youth
,
and
in
*NL*
his
courteous
and
polished
language
showed
himself
to
be
of
good
birth
*NL*
and
courtly
breeding
,
and
rustics
as
we
were
that
listened
to
him
,
even
*NL*
to
our
rusticity
his
gentle
bearing
sufficed
to
make
it
plain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
the
midst
of
his
conversation
he
stopped
and
became
silent
,
*NL*
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
for
some
time
,
during
which
we
*NL*
stood
still
waiting
anxiously
to
see
what
would
come
of
this
abstraction
;
*NL*
and
with
no
little
pity
,
for
from
his
behaviour
,
now
staring
at
the
*NL*
ground
with
fixed
gaze
and
eyes
wide
open
without
moving
an
eyelid
,
again
*NL*
closing
them
,
compressing
his
lips
and
raising
his
eyebrows
,
we
could
*NL*
perceive
plainly
that
a
fit
of
madness
of
some
kind
had
come
upon
him
;
*NL*
and
before
long
he
showed
that
what
we
imagined
was
the
truth
,
for
he
*NL*
arose
in
a
fury
from
the
ground
where
he
had
thrown
himself
,
and
attacked
*NL*
the
first
he
found
near
him
with
such
rage
and
fierceness
that
if
we
had
*NL*
not
dragged
him
off
him
,
he
would
have
beaten
or
bitten
him
to
death
,
all
*NL*
the
while
exclaiming
,
`
Oh
faithless
Fernando
,
here
,
here
shalt
thou
pay
*NL*
the
penalty
of
the
wrong
thou
hast
done
me
;
these
hands
shall
tear
out
*NL*
that
heart
of
thine
,
abode
and
dwelling
of
all
iniquity
,
but
of
deceit
*NL*
and
fraud
above
all
;
and
to
these
he
added
other
words
all
in
effect
*NL*
upbraiding
this
Fernando
and
charging
him
with
treachery
and
*NL*
faithlessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
forced
him
to
release
his
hold
with
no
little
difficulty
,
and
without
*NL*
another
word
he
left
us
,
and
rushing
off
plunged
in
among
these
brakes
*NL*
and
brambles
,
so
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
follow
him
;
from
this
*NL*
we
suppose
that
madness
comes
upon
him
from
time
to
time
,
and
that
some
*NL*
one
called
Fernando
must
have
done
him
a
wrong
of
a
grievous
nature
such
*NL*
as
the
condition
to
which
it
had
brought
him
seemed
to
show
.
All
this
has
*NL*
been
since
then
confirmed
on
those
occasions
,
and
they
have
been
many
,
on
*NL*
which
he
has
crossed
our
path
,
at
one
time
to
beg
the
shepherds
to
give
*NL*
him
some
of
the
food
they
carry
,
at
another
to
take
it
from
them
by
*NL*
force
;
for
when
there
is
a
fit
of
madness
upon
him
,
even
though
the
*NL*
shepherds
offer
it
freely
,
he
will
not
accept
it
but
snatches
it
from
*NL*
them
by
dint
of
blows
;
but
when
he
is
in
his
senses
he
begs
it
for
the
*NL*
love
of
God
,
courteously
and
civilly
,
and
receives
it
with
many
thanks
*NL*
and
not
a
few
tears
.
And
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
sirs
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
goatherd
,
``
it
was
yesterday
that
we
resolved
,
I
and
four
of
the
lads
,
two
*NL*
of
them
our
servants
,
and
the
other
two
friends
of
mine
,
to
go
in
search
*NL*
of
him
until
we
find
him
,
and
when
we
do
to
take
him
,
whether
by
force
or
*NL*
of
his
own
consent
,
to
the
town
of
Almodovar
,
which
is
eight
leagues
from
*NL*
this
,
and
there
strive
to
cure
him
-LRB-
if
indeed
his
malady
admits
of
a
*NL*
cure
-RRB-
,
or
learn
when
he
is
in
his
senses
who
he
is
,
and
if
he
has
*NL*
relatives
to
whom
we
may
give
notice
of
his
misfortune
.
This
,
sirs
,
is
*NL*
all
I
can
say
in
answer
to
what
you
have
asked
me

be
sure
that
the

owner

the

you
found

you
saw
pass

nimbleness

so
naked

*NL*
*NL*
For
Don
Quixote
had
already
described
how
he
had
seen
the
man
go
bounding
*NL*
along
the
mountain
side
,
and
he
was
now
filled
with
amazement
at
what
he
*NL*
heard
from
the
goatherd
,
and
more
eager
than
ever
to
discover
who
the
*NL*
unhappy
madman
was
;
and
in
his
heart
he
resolved
,
as
he
had
done
before
,
*NL*
to
search
for
him
all
over
the
mountain
,
not
leaving
a
corner
or
cave
*NL*
unexamined
until
he
had
found
him
.
But
chance
arranged
matters
better
*NL*
than
he
expected
or
hoped
,
for
at
that
very
moment
,
in
a
gorge
on
the
*NL*
mountain
that
opened
where
they
stood
,
the
youth
he
wished
to
find
made
*NL*
his
appearance
,
coming
along
talking
to
himself
in
a
way
that
would
have
*NL*
been
unintelligible
near
at
hand
,
much
more
at
a
distance
.
His
garb
was
*NL*
what
has
been
described
,
save
that
as
he
drew
near
,
Don
Quixote
perceived
*NL*
that
a
tattered
doublet
which
he
wore
was
amber-tanned
,
from
which
he
*NL*
concluded
that
one
who
wore
such
garments
could
not
be
of
very
low
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Approaching
them
,
the
youth
greeted
them
in
a
harsh
and
hoarse
voice
but
*NL*
with
great
courtesy
.
Don
Quixote
returned
his
salutation
with
equal
*NL*
politeness
,
and
dismounting
from
Rocinante
advanced
with
well-bred
*NL*
bearing
and
grace
to
embrace
him
,
and
held
him
for
some
time
close
in
his
*NL*
arms
as
if
he
had
known
him
for
a
long
time
.
The
other
,
whom
we
may
call
*NL*
the
Ragged
One
of
the
Sorry
Countenance
,
as
Don
Quixote
was
of
the
*NL*
Rueful
,
after
submitting
to
the
embrace
pushed
him
back
a
little
and
,
*NL*
placing
his
hands
on
Don
Quixote
's
shoulders
,
stood
gazing
at
him
as
if
*NL*
seeking
to
see
whether
he
knew
him
,
not
less
amazed
,
perhaps
,
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
face
,
figure
,
and
armour
of
Don
Quixote
than
Don
Quixote
was
*NL*
at
the
sight
of
him
.
To
be
brief
,
the
first
to
speak
after
embracing
was
*NL*
the
Ragged
One
,
and
he
said
what
will
be
told
farther
on
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
IS
CONTINUED
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
SIERRA
MORENA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
relates
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
attention
Don
Quixote
*NL*
listened
to
the
ragged
knight
of
the
Sierra
,
who
began
by
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
a
surety
,
senor
,
whoever
you
are
,
for
I
know
you
not
,
I
thank
you
for
*NL*
the
proofs
of
kindness
and
courtesy
you
have
shown
me
,
and
would
I
were
*NL*
in
a
condition
to
requite
with
something
more
than
good-will
that
which
*NL*
you
have
displayed
towards
me
in
the
cordial
reception
you
have
given
me
;
*NL*
but
my
fate
does
not
afford
me
any
other
means
of
returning
kindnesses
*NL*
done
me
save
the
hearty
desire
to
repay
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
is
to
be
of
service
to
you
,
so
much
so
that
*NL*
I
had
resolved
not
to
quit
these
mountains
until
I
had
found
you
,
and
*NL*
learned
of
you
whether
there
is
any
kind
of
relief
to
be
found
for
that
*NL*
sorrow
under
which
from
the
strangeness
of
your
life
you
seem
to
labour
;
*NL*
and
to
search
for
you
with
all
possible
diligence
,
if
search
had
been
*NL*
necessary
.
And
if
your
misfortune
should
prove
to
be
one
of
those
that
*NL*
refuse
admission
to
any
sort
of
consolation
,
it
was
my
purpose
to
join
*NL*
you
in
lamenting
and
mourning
over
it
,
so
far
as
I
could
;
for
it
is
still
*NL*
some
comfort
in
misfortune
to
find
one
who
can
feel
for
it
.
And
if
my
*NL*
good
intentions
deserve
to
be
acknowledged
with
any
kind
of
courtesy
,
I
*NL*
entreat
you
,
senor
,
by
that
which
I
perceive
you
possess
in
so
high
a
*NL*
degree
,
and
likewise
conjure
you
by
whatever
you
love
or
have
loved
best
*NL*
in
life
,
to
tell
me
who
you
are
and
the
cause
that
has
brought
you
to
*NL*
live
or
die
in
these
solitudes
like
a
brute
beast
,
dwelling
among
them
in
*NL*
a
manner
so
foreign
to
your
condition
as
your
garb
and
appearance
show
.
*NL*
And
I
swear
,
''
added
Don
Quixote
,
``
by
the
order
of
knighthood
which
I
have
*NL*
received
,
and
by
my
vocation
of
knight-errant
,
if
you
gratify
me
in
this
,
*NL*
to
serve
you
with
all
the
zeal
my
calling
demands
of
me
,
either
in
*NL*
relieving
your
misfortune
if
it
admits
of
relief
,
or
in
joining
you
in
*NL*
lamenting
it
as
I
promised
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
of
the
Thicket
,
hearing
him
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
talk
in
*NL*
this
strain
,
did
nothing
but
stare
at
him
,
and
stare
at
him
again
,
and
*NL*
again
survey
him
from
head
to
foot
;
and
when
he
had
thoroughly
examined
*NL*
him
,
he
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
anything
to
give
me
to
eat
,
for
God
's
sake
give
it
me
,
and
*NL*
after
I
have
eaten
I
will
do
all
you
ask
in
acknowledgment
of
the
*NL*
goodwill
you
have
displayed
towards
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
from
his
sack
,
and
the
goatherd
from
his
pouch
,
furnished
the
*NL*
Ragged
One
with
the
means
of
appeasing
his
hunger
,
and
what
they
gave
him
*NL*
he
ate
like
a
half-witted
being
,
so
hastily
that
he
took
no
time
between
*NL*
mouthfuls
,
gorging
rather
than
swallowing
;
and
while
he
ate
neither
he
*NL*
nor
they
who
observed
him
uttered
a
word
.
As
soon
as
he
had
done
he
made
*NL*
signs
to
them
to
follow
him
,
which
they
did
,
and
he
led
them
to
a
green
*NL*
plot
which
lay
a
little
farther
off
round
the
corner
of
a
rock
.
On
*NL*
reaching
it
he
stretched
himself
upon
the
grass
,
and
the
others
did
the
*NL*
same
,
all
keeping
silence
,
until
the
Ragged
One
,
settling
himself
in
his
*NL*
place
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
your
wish
,
sirs
,
that
I
should
disclose
in
a
few
words
the
*NL*
surpassing
extent
of
my
misfortunes
,
you
must
promise
not
to
break
the
*NL*
thread
of
my
sad
story
with
any
question
or
other
interruption
,
for
the
*NL*
instant
you
do
so
the
tale
I
tell
will
come
to
an
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
of
the
Ragged
One
reminded
Don
Quixote
of
the
tale
his
squire
*NL*
had
told
him
,
when
he
failed
to
keep
count
of
the
goats
that
had
crossed
*NL*
the
river
and
the
story
remained
unfinished
;
but
to
return
to
the
Ragged
*NL*
One
,
he
went
on
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
this
warning
because
I
wish
to
pass
briefly
over
the
story
of
*NL*
my
misfortunes
,
for
recalling
them
to
memory
only
serves
to
add
fresh
*NL*
ones
,
and
the
less
you
question
me
the
sooner
shall
I
make
an
end
of
the
*NL*
recital
,
though
I
shall
not
omit
to
relate
anything
of
importance
in
*NL*
order
fully
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
gave
the
promise
for
himself
and
the
others
,
and
with
this
*NL*
assurance
he
began
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Cardenio
,
my
birthplace
one
of
the
best
cities
of
this
*NL*
Andalusia
,
my
family
noble
,
my
parents
rich
,
my
misfortune
so
great
that
*NL*
my
parents
must
have
wept
and
my
family
grieved
over
it
without
being
*NL*
able
by
their
wealth
to
lighten
it
;
for
the
gifts
of
fortune
can
do
*NL*
little
to
relieve
reverses
sent
by
Heaven
.
In
that
same
country
there
was
*NL*
a
heaven
in
which
love
had
placed
all
the
glory
I
could
desire
;
such
was
*NL*
the
beauty
of
Luscinda
,
a
damsel
as
noble
and
as
rich
as
I
,
but
of
*NL*
happier
fortunes
,
and
of
less
firmness
than
was
due
to
so
worthy
a
*NL*
passion
as
mine
.
This
Luscinda
I
loved
,
worshipped
,
and
adored
from
my
*NL*
earliest
and
tenderest
years
,
and
she
loved
me
in
all
the
innocence
and
*NL*
sincerity
of
childhood
.
Our
parents
were
aware
of
our
feelings
,
and
were
*NL*
not
sorry
to
perceive
them
,
for
they
saw
clearly
that
as
they
ripened
*NL*
they
must
lead
at
last
to
a
marriage
between
us
,
a
thing
that
seemed
*NL*
almost
prearranged
by
the
equality
of
our
families
and
wealth
.
We
grew
*NL*
up
,
and
with
our
growth
grew
the
love
between
us
,
so
that
the
father
of
*NL*
Luscinda
felt
bound
for
propriety
's
sake
to
refuse
me
admission
to
his
*NL*
house
,
in
this
perhaps
imitating
the
parents
of
that
Thisbe
so
celebrated
*NL*
by
the
poets
,
and
this
refusal
but
added
love
to
love
and
flame
to
flame
;
*NL*
for
though
they
enforced
silence
upon
our
tongues
they
could
not
impose
*NL*
it
upon
our
pens
,
which
can
make
known
the
heart
's
secrets
to
a
loved
one
*NL*
more
freely
than
tongues
;
for
many
a
time
the
presence
of
the
object
of
*NL*
love
shakes
the
firmest
will
and
strikes
dumb
the
boldest
tongue
.
Ah
*NL*
heavens
!
how
many
letters
did
I
write
her
,
and
how
many
dainty
modest
*NL*
replies
did
I
receive
!
how
many
ditties
and
love-songs
did
I
compose
in
*NL*
which
my
heart
declared
and
made
known
its
feelings
,
described
its
ardent
*NL*
longings
,
revelled
in
its
recollections
and
dallied
with
its
desires
!
At
*NL*
length
growing
impatient
and
feeling
my
heart
languishing
with
longing
to
*NL*
see
her
,
I
resolved
to
put
into
execution
and
carry
out
what
seemed
to
me
*NL*
the
best
mode
of
winning
my
desired
and
merited
reward
,
to
ask
her
of
her
*NL*
father
for
my
lawful
wife
,
which
I
did
.
To
this
his
answer
was
that
he
*NL*
thanked
me
for
the
disposition
I
showed
to
do
honour
to
him
and
to
regard
*NL*
myself
as
honoured
by
the
bestowal
of
his
treasure
;
but
that
as
my
father
*NL*
was
alive
it
was
his
by
right
to
make
this
demand
,
for
if
it
were
not
in
*NL*
accordance
with
his
full
will
and
pleasure
,
Luscinda
was
not
to
be
taken
*NL*
or
given
by
stealth
.
I
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
,
reflecting
that
*NL*
there
was
reason
in
what
he
said
,
and
that
my
father
would
assent
to
it
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
should
tell
him
,
and
with
that
view
I
went
the
very
same
*NL*
instant
to
let
him
know
what
my
desires
were
.
When
I
entered
the
room
*NL*
where
he
was
I
found
him
with
an
open
letter
in
his
hand
,
which
,
before
I
*NL*
could
utter
a
word
,
he
gave
me
,
saying
,
`
By
this
letter
thou
wilt
see
,
*NL*
Cardenio
,
the
disposition
the
Duke
Ricardo
has
to
serve
thee
.
'
This
Duke
*NL*
Ricardo
,
as
you
,
sirs
,
probably
know
already
,
is
a
grandee
of
Spain
who
*NL*
has
his
seat
in
the
best
part
of
this
Andalusia
.
I
took
and
read
the
*NL*
letter
,
which
was
couched
in
terms
so
flattering
that
even
I
myself
felt
*NL*
it
would
be
wrong
in
my
father
not
to
comply
with
the
request
the
duke
*NL*
made
in
it
,
which
was
that
he
would
send
me
immediately
to
him
,
as
he
*NL*
wished
me
to
become
the
companion
,
not
servant
,
of
his
eldest
son
,
and
*NL*
would
take
upon
himself
the
charge
of
placing
me
in
a
position
*NL*
corresponding
to
the
esteem
in
which
he
held
me
.
On
reading
the
letter
my
*NL*
voice
failed
me
,
and
still
more
when
I
heard
my
father
say
,
`
Two
days
*NL*
hence
thou
wilt
depart
,
Cardenio
,
in
accordance
with
the
duke
's
wish
,
and
*NL*
give
thanks
to
God
who
is
opening
a
road
to
thee
by
which
thou
mayest
*NL*
attain
what
I
know
thou
dost
deserve
;
and
to
these
words
he
added
others
*NL*
of
fatherly
counsel
.
The
time
for
my
departure
arrived
;
I
spoke
one
night
*NL*
to
Luscinda
,
I
told
her
all
that
had
occurred
,
as
I
did
also
to
her
*NL*
father
,
entreating
him
to
allow
some
delay
,
and
to
defer
the
disposal
of
*NL*
her
hand
until
I
should
see
what
the
Duke
Ricardo
sought
of
me
:
he
gave
*NL*
me
the
promise
,
and
she
confirmed
it
with
vows
and
swoonings
unnumbered
.
*NL*
Finally
,
I
presented
myself
to
the
duke
,
and
was
received
and
treated
by
*NL*
him
so
kindly
that
very
soon
envy
began
to
do
its
work
,
the
old
servants
*NL*
growing
envious
of
me
,
and
regarding
the
duke
's
inclination
to
show
me
*NL*
favour
as
an
injury
to
themselves
.
But
the
one
to
whom
my
arrival
gave
*NL*
the
greatest
pleasure
was
the
duke
's
second
son
,
Fernando
by
name
,
a
*NL*
gallant
youth
,
of
noble
,
generous
,
and
amorous
disposition
,
who
very
soon
*NL*
made
so
intimate
a
friend
of
me
that
it
was
remarked
by
everybody
;
for
*NL*
though
the
elder
was
attached
to
me
,
and
showed
me
kindness
,
he
did
not
*NL*
carry
his
affectionate
treatment
to
the
same
length
as
Don
Fernando
.
It
*NL*
so
happened
,
then
,
that
as
between
friends
no
secret
remains
unshared
,
*NL*
and
as
the
favour
I
enjoyed
with
Don
Fernando
had
grown
into
friendship
,
*NL*
he
made
all
his
thoughts
known
to
me
,
and
in
particular
a
love
affair
*NL*
which
troubled
his
mind
a
little
.
He
was
deeply
in
love
with
a
peasant
*NL*
girl
,
a
vassal
of
his
father
's
,
the
daughter
of
wealthy
parents
,
and
*NL*
herself
so
beautiful
,
modest
,
discreet
,
and
virtuous
,
that
no
one
who
*NL*
knew
her
was
able
to
decide
in
which
of
these
respects
she
was
most
*NL*
highly
gifted
or
most
excelled
.
The
attractions
of
the
fair
peasant
*NL*
raised
the
passion
of
Don
Fernando
to
such
a
point
that
,
in
order
to
gain
*NL*
his
object
and
overcome
her
virtuous
resolutions
,
he
determined
to
pledge
*NL*
his
word
to
her
to
become
her
husband
,
for
to
attempt
it
in
any
other
way
*NL*
was
to
attempt
an
impossibility
.
Bound
to
him
as
I
was
by
friendship
,
I
*NL*
strove
by
the
best
arguments
and
the
most
forcible
examples
I
could
think
*NL*
of
to
restrain
and
dissuade
him
from
such
a
course
;
but
perceiving
I
*NL*
produced
no
effect
I
resolved
to
make
the
Duke
Ricardo
,
his
father
,
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
matter
;
but
Don
Fernando
,
being
sharp-witted
and
*NL*
shrewd
,
foresaw
and
apprehended
this
,
perceiving
that
by
my
duty
as
a
*NL*
good
servant
I
was
bound
not
to
keep
concealed
a
thing
so
much
opposed
to
*NL*
the
honour
of
my
lord
the
duke
;
and
so
,
to
mislead
and
deceive
me
,
he
*NL*
told
me
he
could
find
no
better
way
of
effacing
from
his
mind
the
beauty
*NL*
that
so
enslaved
him
than
by
absenting
himself
for
some
months
,
and
that
*NL*
he
wished
the
absence
to
be
effected
by
our
going
,
both
of
us
,
to
my
*NL*
father
's
house
under
the
pretence
,
which
he
would
make
to
the
duke
,
of
*NL*
going
to
see
and
buy
some
fine
horses
that
there
were
in
my
city
,
which
*NL*
produces
the
best
in
the
world
.
When
I
heard
him
say
so
,
even
if
his
*NL*
resolution
had
not
been
so
good
a
one
I
should
have
hailed
it
as
one
of
*NL*
the
happiest
that
could
be
imagined
,
prompted
by
my
affection
,
seeing
*NL*
what
a
favourable
chance
and
opportunity
it
offered
me
of
returning
to
*NL*
see
my
Luscinda
.
With
this
thought
and
wish
I
commended
his
idea
and
*NL*
encouraged
his
design
,
advising
him
to
put
it
into
execution
as
quickly
*NL*
as
possible
,
as
,
in
truth
,
absence
produced
its
effect
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
most
deeply
rooted
feelings
.
But
,
as
afterwards
appeared
,
when
he
said
*NL*
this
to
me
he
had
already
enjoyed
the
peasant
girl
under
the
title
of
*NL*
husband
,
and
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
of
making
it
known
with
*NL*
safety
to
himself
,
being
in
dread
of
what
his
father
the
duke
would
do
*NL*
when
he
came
to
know
of
his
folly
.
It
happened
,
then
,
that
as
with
young
*NL*
men
love
is
for
the
most
part
nothing
more
than
appetite
,
which
,
as
its
*NL*
final
object
is
enjoyment
,
comes
to
an
end
on
obtaining
it
,
and
that
*NL*
which
seemed
to
be
love
takes
to
flight
,
as
it
can
not
pass
the
limit
*NL*
fixed
by
nature
,
which
fixes
no
limit
to
true
love
--
what
I
mean
is
that
*NL*
after
Don
Fernando
had
enjoyed
this
peasant
girl
his
passion
subsided
and
*NL*
his
eagerness
cooled
,
and
if
at
first
he
feigned
a
wish
to
absent
himself
*NL*
in
order
to
cure
his
love
,
he
was
now
in
reality
anxious
to
go
to
avoid
*NL*
keeping
his
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
duke
gave
him
permission
,
and
ordered
me
to
accompany
him
;
we
*NL*
arrived
at
my
city
,
and
my
father
gave
him
the
reception
due
to
his
rank
;
*NL*
I
saw
Luscinda
without
delay
,
and
,
though
it
had
not
been
dead
or
*NL*
deadened
,
my
love
gathered
fresh
life
.
To
my
sorrow
I
told
the
story
of
*NL*
it
to
Don
Fernando
,
for
I
thought
that
in
virtue
of
the
great
friendship
*NL*
he
bore
me
I
was
bound
to
conceal
nothing
from
him
.
I
extolled
her
*NL*
beauty
,
her
gaiety
,
her
wit
,
so
warmly
,
that
my
praises
excited
in
him
a
*NL*
desire
to
see
a
damsel
adorned
by
such
attractions
.
To
my
misfortune
I
*NL*
yielded
to
it
,
showing
her
to
him
one
night
by
the
light
of
a
taper
at
a
*NL*
window
where
we
used
to
talk
to
one
another
.
As
she
appeared
to
him
in
*NL*
her
dressing-gown
,
she
drove
all
the
beauties
he
had
seen
until
then
out
*NL*
of
his
recollection
;
speech
failed
him
,
his
head
turned
,
he
was
*NL*
spell-bound
,
and
in
the
end
love-smitten
,
as
you
will
see
in
the
course
*NL*
of
the
story
of
my
misfortune
;
and
to
inflame
still
further
his
passion
,
*NL*
which
he
hid
from
me
and
revealed
to
Heaven
alone
,
it
so
happened
that
*NL*
one
day
he
found
a
note
of
hers
entreating
me
to
demand
her
of
her
father
*NL*
in
marriage
,
so
delicate
,
so
modest
,
and
so
tender
,
that
on
reading
it
he
*NL*
told
me
that
in
Luscinda
alone
were
combined
all
the
charms
of
beauty
and
*NL*
understanding
that
were
distributed
among
all
the
other
women
in
the
*NL*
world
.
It
is
true
,
and
I
own
it
now
,
that
though
I
knew
what
good
cause
*NL*
Don
Fernando
had
to
praise
Luscinda
,
it
gave
me
uneasiness
to
hear
these
*NL*
praises
from
his
mouth
,
and
I
began
to
fear
,
and
with
reason
to
feel
*NL*
distrust
of
him
,
for
there
was
no
moment
when
he
was
not
ready
to
talk
of
*NL*
Luscinda
,
and
he
would
start
the
subject
himself
even
though
he
dragged
*NL*
it
in
unseasonably
,
a
circumstance
that
aroused
in
me
a
certain
amount
of
*NL*
jealousy
;
not
that
I
feared
any
change
in
the
constancy
or
faith
of
*NL*
Luscinda
;
but
still
my
fate
led
me
to
forebode
what
she
assured
me
*NL*
against
.
Don
Fernando
contrived
always
to
read
the
letters
I
sent
to
*NL*
Luscinda
and
her
answers
to
me
,
under
the
pretence
that
he
enjoyed
the
*NL*
wit
and
sense
of
both
.
It
so
happened
,
then
,
that
Luscinda
having
begged
*NL*
of
me
a
book
of
chivalry
to
read
,
one
that
she
was
very
fond
of
,
Amadis
*NL*
of
Gaul
-
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
no
sooner
heard
a
book
of
chivalry
mentioned
,
than
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
your
worship
told
me
at
the
beginning
of
your
story
that
the
Lady
*NL*
Luscinda
was
fond
of
books
of
chivalry
,
no
other
laudation
would
have
*NL*
been
requisite
to
impress
upon
me
the
superiority
of
her
understanding
,
*NL*
for
it
could
not
have
been
of
the
excellence
you
describe
had
a
taste
for
*NL*
such
delightful
reading
been
wanting
;
so
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
you
*NL*
need
waste
no
more
words
in
describing
her
beauty
,
worth
,
and
*NL*
intelligence
;
for
,
on
merely
hearing
what
her
taste
was
,
I
declare
her
to
*NL*
be
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
intelligent
woman
in
the
world
;
and
I
*NL*
wish
your
worship
had
,
along
with
Amadis
of
Gaul
,
sent
her
the
worthy
Don
*NL*
Rugel
of
Greece
,
for
I
know
the
Lady
Luscinda
would
greatly
relish
*NL*
Daraida
and
Garaya
,
and
the
shrewd
sayings
of
the
shepherd
Darinel
,
and
*NL*
the
admirable
verses
of
his
bucolics
,
sung
and
delivered
by
him
with
such
*NL*
sprightliness
,
wit
,
and
ease
;
but
a
time
may
come
when
this
omission
can
*NL*
be
remedied
,
and
to
rectify
it
nothing
more
is
needed
than
for
your
*NL*
worship
to
be
so
good
as
to
come
with
me
to
my
village
,
for
there
I
can
*NL*
give
you
more
than
three
hundred
books
which
are
the
delight
of
my
soul
*NL*
and
the
entertainment
of
my
life
;
--
though
it
occurs
to
me
that
I
have
not
*NL*
got
one
of
them
now
,
thanks
to
the
spite
of
wicked
and
envious
*NL*
enchanters
;
--
but
pardon
me
for
having
broken
the
promise
we
made
not
to
*NL*
interrupt
your
discourse
;
for
when
I
hear
chivalry
or
knights-errant
*NL*
mentioned
,
I
can
no
more
help
talking
about
them
than
the
rays
of
the
sun
*NL*
can
help
giving
heat
,
or
those
of
the
moon
moisture
;
pardon
me
,
*NL*
therefore
,
and
proceed
,
for
that
is
more
to
the
purpose
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Don
Quixote
was
saying
this
,
Cardenio
allowed
his
head
to
fall
upon
*NL*
his
breast
,
and
seemed
plunged
in
deep
thought
;
and
though
twice
Don
*NL*
Quixote
bade
him
go
on
with
his
story
,
he
neither
looked
up
nor
uttered
a
*NL*
word
in
reply
;
but
after
some
time
he
raised
his
head
and
said
,
``
I
can
not
*NL*
get
rid
of
the
idea
,
nor
will
anyone
in
the
world
remove
it
,
or
make
me
*NL*
think
otherwise
--
and
he
would
be
a
blockhead
who
would
hold
or
believe
*NL*
anything
else
than
that
that
arrant
knave
Master
Elisabad
made
free
with
*NL*
Queen
Madasima
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
true
,
by
all
that
's
good
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
in
high
wrath
,
*NL*
turning
upon
him
angrily
,
as
his
way
was
;
``
and
it
is
a
very
great
*NL*
slander
,
or
rather
villainy
.
Queen
Madasima
was
a
very
illustrious
lady
,
*NL*
and
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
so
exalted
a
princess
would
have
made
*NL*
free
with
a
quack
;
and
whoever
maintains
the
contrary
lies
like
a
great
*NL*
scoundrel
,
and
I
will
give
him
to
know
it
,
on
foot
or
on
horseback
,
armed
*NL*
or
unarmed
,
by
night
or
by
day
,
or
as
he
likes
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cardenio
was
looking
at
him
steadily
,
and
his
mad
fit
having
now
come
*NL*
upon
him
,
he
had
no
disposition
to
go
on
with
his
story
,
nor
would
Don
*NL*
Quixote
have
listened
to
it
,
so
much
had
what
he
had
heard
about
Madasima
*NL*
disgusted
him
.
Strange
to
say
,
he
stood
up
for
her
as
if
she
were
in
*NL*
earnest
his
veritable
born
lady
;
to
such
a
pass
had
his
unholy
books
*NL*
brought
him
.
Cardenio
,
then
,
being
,
as
I
said
,
now
mad
,
when
he
heard
*NL*
himself
given
the
lie
,
and
called
a
scoundrel
and
other
insulting
names
,
*NL*
not
relishing
the
jest
,
snatched
up
a
stone
that
he
found
near
him
,
and
*NL*
with
it
delivered
such
a
blow
on
Don
Quixote
's
breast
that
he
laid
him
on
*NL*
his
back
.
Sancho
Panza
,
seeing
his
master
treated
in
this
fashion
,
*NL*
attacked
the
madman
with
his
closed
fist
;
but
the
Ragged
One
received
him
*NL*
in
such
a
way
that
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
he
stretched
him
at
his
feet
,
*NL*
and
then
mounting
upon
him
crushed
his
ribs
to
his
own
satisfaction
;
the
*NL*
goatherd
,
who
came
to
the
rescue
,
shared
the
same
fate
;
and
having
beaten
*NL*
and
pummelled
them
all
he
left
them
and
quietly
withdrew
to
his
*NL*
hiding-place
on
the
mountain
.
Sancho
rose
,
and
with
the
rage
he
felt
at
*NL*
finding
himself
so
belaboured
without
deserving
it
,
ran
to
take
vengeance
*NL*
on
the
goatherd
,
accusing
him
of
not
giving
them
warning
that
this
man
*NL*
was
at
times
taken
with
a
mad
fit
,
for
if
they
had
known
it
they
would
*NL*
have
been
on
their
guard
to
protect
themselves
.
The
goatherd
replied
that
*NL*
he
had
said
so
,
and
that
if
he
had
not
heard
him
,
that
was
no
fault
of
*NL*
his
.
Sancho
retorted
,
and
the
goatherd
rejoined
,
and
the
altercation
*NL*
ended
in
their
seizing
each
other
by
the
beard
,
and
exchanging
such
*NL*
fisticuffs
that
if
Don
Quixote
had
not
made
peace
between
them
,
they
*NL*
would
have
knocked
one
another
to
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
alone
,
Sir
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
''
said
Sancho
,
*NL*
grappling
with
the
goatherd
,
``
for
of
this
fellow
,
who
is
a
clown
like
*NL*
myself
,
and
no
dubbed
knight
,
I
can
safely
take
satisfaction
for
the
*NL*
affront
he
has
offered
me
,
fighting
with
him
hand
to
hand
like
an
honest
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
I
know
that
he
is
not
to
blame
for
*NL*
what
has
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
he
pacified
them
,
and
again
asked
the
goatherd
if
it
would
be
*NL*
possible
to
find
Cardenio
,
as
he
felt
the
greatest
anxiety
to
know
the
*NL*
end
of
his
story
.
The
goatherd
told
him
,
as
he
had
told
him
before
,
that
*NL*
there
was
no
knowing
of
a
certainty
where
his
lair
was
;
but
that
if
he
*NL*
wandered
about
much
in
that
neighbourhood
he
could
not
fail
to
fall
in
*NL*
with
him
either
in
or
out
of
his
senses

*NL*
Don

took
leave
of
the
goatherd
,
and
once
more
mounting
Rocinante
*NL*
bade
Sancho
follow
him
,
which
he
having
no
ass
,
did
very
discontentedly
.
*NL*
They
proceeded
slowly
,
making
their
way
into
the
most
rugged
part
of
the
*NL*
mountain
,
Sancho
all
the
while
dying
to
have
a
talk
with
his
master
,
and
*NL*
longing
for
him
to
begin
,
so
that
there
should
be
no
breach
of
the
*NL*
injunction
laid
upon
him
;
but
unable
to
keep
silence
so
long
he
said
to
*NL*
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
give
me
your
worship
's
blessing
and
dismissal
,
for
*NL*
I
'd
like
to
go
home
at
once
to
my
wife
and
children
with
whom
I
can
at
*NL*
any
rate
talk
and
converse
as
much
as
I
like
;
for
to
want
me
to
go
*NL*
through
these
solitudes
day
and
night
and
not
speak
to
you
when
I
have
a
*NL*
mind
is
burying
me
alive
.
If
luck
would
have
it
that
animals
spoke
as
*NL*
they
did
in
the
days
of
Guisopete
,
it
would
not
be
so
bad
,
because
I
*NL*
could
talk
to
Rocinante
about
whatever
came
into
my
head
,
and
so
put
up
*NL*
with
my
ill-fortune
;
but
it
is
a
hard
case
,
and
not
to
be
borne
with
*NL*
patience
,
to
go
seeking
adventures
all
one
's
life
and
get
nothing
but
*NL*
kicks
and
blanketings
,
brickbats
and
punches
,
and
with
all
this
to
have
*NL*
to
sew
up
one
's
mouth
without
daring
to
say
what
is
in
one
's
heart
,
just
*NL*
as
if
one
were
dumb

*NL*
*NL*

I

thee

replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
thou
art
dying
to
have
*NL*
the
interdict
I
placed
upon
thy
tongue
removed
;
consider
it
removed

*NL*
``
So
be
it

Sancho

let
me
speak
now

God

what
will
*NL*
happen
by-and-by

to
take
advantage
of
the
permit
at
once
,
I
ask
,
*NL*
what
made
your
worship
stand
up
so
for
that
Queen
Majimasa
,

whatever
*NL*
her
name
is
,

what
did
it
matter
whether
that

was
a
friend

hers

not

for
if
your
worship
had
let
that
pass
--
and
you
were
not
a
*NL*
judge
in
the
matter
--
it
is
my
belief
the
madman
would
have
gone
on
with
*NL*
his
story
,
and
the
blow
of
the
stone
,
and
the
kicks
,
and
more
than
half
a
*NL*
dozen
cuffs
would
have
been
escaped

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
faith

Sancho

answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
thou
knewest
as
I
do
what
*NL*
an
honourable

illustrious
lady
Queen
Madasima
was
,
I
know
thou
*NL*
wouldst
say
I
had
great
patience
that
I
did
not
break
in
pieces
the
mouth
*NL*
that
uttered
such
blasphemies
,
for
a
very
great
blasphemy
it
is
to
say
or
*NL*
imagine
that
a
queen
has
made
free
with
a
surgeon
.
The
truth
of
the
story
*NL*
is
that
that
Master
Elisabad
whom
the
madman
mentioned
was
a
man
of
great
*NL*
prudence
and
sound
judgment
,
and
served
as
governor
and
physician
to
the
*NL*
queen
,
but
to
suppose
that
she
was
his
mistress
is
nonsense
deserving
*NL*
very
severe
punishment
;
and
as
a
proof
that
Cardenio
did
not
know
what
he
*NL*
was
saying
,
remember
when
he
said
it
he
was
out
of
his
wits

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
say

said
Sancho
;
``
there
was
no
occasion
for
minding
the
*NL*
words
of
a
madman
;
for
if
good
luck
had
not
helped
your
worship
,
and
he
*NL*
had
sent
that
stone
at
your
head
instead
of
at
your
breast
,
a
fine
way
we
*NL*
should
have
been
in
for
standing
up
for
my
lady
yonder
,
God
confound
her
!

And
then
,
would
not
Cardenio
have
gone
free
as
a
madman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Against
men

Don

much
more
for
queens
of
such
high

Queen

for
whom
I
have
a
particular
regard

of
her
amiable

she
had
many

her
in

her
afflictions

the

ill-disposed

that

make
a
knight-errant
perfect
and
famous

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
it
very
perilous
,
this
achievement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
he
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
;
``
though
it
may
be
in
the
dice
*NL*
that
we
may
throw
deuce-ace
instead
of

but
all
will
depend
on
thy
*NL*
diligence

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
diligence
!
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
if
thou
dost
return
soon
from
the
place
*NL*
where
I
mean
to
send
thee
,
my
penance
will
be
soon
over
,
and
my
glory
*NL*
will
soon
begin
.
But
as
it
is
not
right
to
keep
thee
any
longer
in
*NL*
suspense
,
waiting
to
see
what
comes
of
my
words
,
I
would
have
thee
know
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
that
the
famous
Amadis
of
Gaul
was
one
of
the
most
perfect
*NL*
knights-errant
--
I
am
wrong
to
say
he
was
one
;
he
stood
alone
,
the
first
,
*NL*
the
only
one
,
the
lord
of
all
that
were
in
the
world
in
his
time
.
A
fig
*NL*
for
Don
Belianis
,
and
for
all
who
say
he
equalled
him
in
any
respect
,
*NL*
for
,
my
oath
upon
it
,
they
are
deceiving
themselves
!
I
say
,
too
,
that
*NL*
when
a
painter
desires
to
become
famous
in
his
art
he
endeavours
to
copy
*NL*
the
originals
of
the
rarest
painters
that
he
knows
;
and
the
same
rule
*NL*
holds
good
for
all
the
most
important
crafts
and
callings
that
serve
to
*NL*
adorn
a
state
;
thus
must
he
who
would
be
esteemed
prudent
and
patient
*NL*
imitate
Ulysses
,
in
whose
person
and
labours
Homer
presents
to
us
a
*NL*
lively
picture
of
prudence
and
patience
;
as
Virgil
,
too
,
shows
us
in
the
*NL*
person
of
AEneas
the
virtue
of
a
pious
son
and
the
sagacity
of
a
brave
*NL*
and
skilful
captain
;
not
representing
or
describing
them
as
they
were
,
*NL*
but
as
they
ought
to
be
,
so
as
to
leave
the
example
of
their
virtues
to
*NL*
posterity
.
In
the
same
way
Amadis
was
the
polestar
,
day-star
,
sun
of
*NL*
valiant
and
devoted
knights
,
whom
all
we
who
fight
under
the
banner
of
*NL*
love
and
chivalry
are
bound
to
imitate
.
This
,
then
,
being
so
,
I
consider
,
*NL*
friend
Sancho
,
that
the
knight-errant
who
shall
imitate
him
most
closely
*NL*
will
come
nearest
to
reaching
the
perfection
of
chivalry
.
Now
one
of
the
*NL*
instances
in
which
this
knight
most
conspicuously
showed
his
prudence
,
*NL*
worth
,
valour
,
endurance
,
fortitude
,
and
love
,
was
when
he
withdrew
,
*NL*
rejected
by
the
Lady
Oriana
,
to
do
penance
upon
the
Pena
Pobre
,
changing
*NL*
his
name
into
that
of
Beltenebros
,
a
name
assuredly
significant
and
*NL*
appropriate
to
the
life
which
he
had
voluntarily
adopted
.
So
,
as
it
is
*NL*
easier
for
me
to
imitate
him
in
this
than
in
cleaving
giants
asunder
,
*NL*
cutting
off
serpents
'
heads
,
slaying
dragons
,
routing
armies
,
destroying
*NL*
fleets
,
and
breaking
enchantments
,
and
as
this
place
is
so
well
suited
*NL*
for
a
similar
purpose
,
I
must
not
allow
the
opportunity
to
escape
which
*NL*
now
so
conveniently
offers
me
its
forelock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
in
reality
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
your
worship
means
to
do
in
*NL*
such
an
out-of-the-way
place
as
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
not
told
thee
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
I
mean
to
imitate
*NL*
Amadis
here
,
playing
the
victim
of
despair
,
the
madman
,
the
maniac
,
so
as
*NL*
at
the
same
time
to
imitate
the
valiant
Don
Roland
,
when
at
the
fountain
*NL*
he
had
evidence
of
the
fair
Angelica
having
disgraced
herself
with
Medoro
*NL*
and
through
grief
thereat
went
mad
,
and
plucked
up
trees
,
troubled
the
*NL*
waters
of
the
clear
springs
,
slew
destroyed
flocks
,
burned
down
huts
,
*NL*
levelled
houses
,
dragged
mares
after
him
,
and
perpetrated
a
hundred
*NL*
thousand
other
outrages
worthy
of
everlasting
renown
and
record
?
And
*NL*
though
I
have
no
intention
of
imitating
Roland
,
or
Orlando
,
or
Rotolando
*NL*
-LRB-
for
he
went
by
all
these
names
-RRB-
,
step
by
step
in
all
the
mad
things
he
*NL*
did
,
said
,
and
thought
,
I
will
make
a
rough
copy
to
the
best
of
my
power
*NL*
of
all
that
seems
to
me
most
essential
;
but
perhaps
I
shall
content
*NL*
myself
with
the
simple
imitation
of
Amadis
,
who
without
giving
way
to
any
*NL*
mischievous
madness
but
merely
to
tears
and
sorrow
,
gained
as
much
fame
*NL*
as
the
most
famous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
the
knights
who
behaved
in
this
way
*NL*
had
provocation
and
cause
for
those
follies
and
penances

what
cause
*NL*
has
your
worship
for
going
mad
?
What
lady
has
rejected
you
,
or
what
*NL*
evidence
have
you
found
to
prove
that
the
lady
Dulcinea
del

been
trifling
with
Moor

Christian
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

point

Don

that
is
the
beauty
of

this
business
of
mine

no

a
knight-errant
for
going
mad
when
he
*NL*
has
cause

the
thing
is
to
turn
crazy
without
any
provocation

let
my
*NL*
lady
know

if
I
do
this
in
the
dry
,
what
I
would
do
in
the
moist
;

I
have
abundant
cause
in
the
long
separation
I
have
endured
from
*NL*
my
lady
till
death

Dulcinea
del
Toboso

for
as
thou
didst
hear

feared

so

Sancho
,
waste
no
time
in
advising
me
against
so
*NL*
rare
,
so
happy
,
and
so
unheard-of
an
imitation
;
mad
I
am

mad
I
must
*NL*
be
until
thou
returnest
with
the
answer
to
a
letter
that
I
mean
to
send
*NL*
by
thee
to
my
lady
Dulcinea

if
it
be
such
as
my
constancy
deserves

*NL*
my
insanity

penance
will
come
to
an
end

if
it
be
to
the
opposite

effect

I
shall
become
mad
in
earnest

,
being
so
,
I
shall
suffer
no

more
;
thus
in
whatever
way
she
may
answer
I
shall
escape
from
the
*NL*
struggle
and
affliction
in
which
thou
wilt
leave
me

enjoying

senses
the
boon
thou
bearest

But
tell
me

Sancho

hast
thou
got
Mambrino

helmet
safe

for
I
saw
thee
take
it
up
from
the
ground
when
that
ungrateful
wretch

tried
to
break
it
in
pieces

could
not

be
seen

*NL*
To

Sancho
made
answer
,

not

of

from
them
I
begin

suspect

all

kingdoms

and
giving

contraries
?
And
not
because
it
really
is
so
,
*NL*
but
because
there
is
always
a
swarm
of
enchanters
in
attendance
upon
us
*NL*
that
change
and
alter
everything
with
us
,
and
turn
things
as
they
please
,
*NL*
and
according
as
they
are
disposed
to
aid
or
destroy
us
;
thus
what
seems
*NL*
to
thee
a
barber
's
basin
seems
to
me
Mambrino
's
helmet
,
and
to
another
it
*NL*
will
seem
something
else
;
and
rare
foresight
it
was
in
the
sage
who
is
on
*NL*
my
side
to
make
what
is
really
and
truly
Mambrine
's
helmet
seem
a
basin
*NL*
to
everybody
,
for
,
being
held
in
such
estimation
as
it
is
,
all
the
world
*NL*
would
pursue
me
to
rob
me
of
it
;
but
when
they
see
it
is
only
a
barber
's
*NL*
basin
they
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
obtain
it
;
as
was
plainly
shown
by
*NL*
him
who
tried
to
break
it
,
and
left
it
on
the
ground
without
taking
it
,
*NL*
for
,
by
my
faith
,
had
he
known
it
he
would
never
have
left
it
behind
.
*NL*
Keep
it
safe
,
my
friend
,
for
just
now
I
have
no
need
of
it
;
indeed
,
I
*NL*
shall
have
to
take
off
all
this
armour
and
remain
as
naked
as
I
was
born
,
*NL*
if
I
have
a
mind
to
follow
Roland
rather
than
Amadis
in
my
penance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
talking
they
reached
the
foot
of
a
high
mountain
which
stood
like
an
*NL*
isolated
peak
among
the
others
that
surrounded
it
.
Past
its
base
there
*NL*
flowed
a
gentle
brook
,
all
around
it
spread
a
meadow
so
green
and
*NL*
luxuriant
that
it
was
a
delight
to
the
eyes
to
look
upon
it
,
and
forest
*NL*
trees
in
abundance
,
and
shrubs
and
flowers
,
added
to
the
charms
of
the
*NL*
spot
.
Upon
this
place
the
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
fixed
his
*NL*
choice
for
the
performance
of
his
penance
,
and
as
he
beheld
it
exclaimed
*NL*
in
a
loud
voice
as
though
he
were
out
of
his
senses
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
place
,
oh
,
ye
heavens
,
that
I
select
and
choose
for
*NL*
bewailing
the
misfortune
in
which
ye
yourselves
have
plunged
me
:
this
is
*NL*
the
spot
where
the
overflowings
of
mine
eyes
shall
swell
the
waters
of
*NL*
yon
little
brook
,
and
my
deep
and
endless
sighs
shall
stir
unceasingly
*NL*
the
leaves
of
these
mountain
trees
,
in
testimony
and
token
of
the
pain
my
*NL*
persecuted
heart
is
suffering
.
Oh
,
ye
rural
deities
,
whoever
ye
be
that
*NL*
haunt
this
lone
spot
,
give
ear
to
the
complaint
of
a
wretched
lover
whom
*NL*
long
absence
and
brooding
jealousy
have
driven
to
bewail
his
fate
among
*NL*
these
wilds
and
complain
of
the
hard
heart
of
that
fair
and
ungrateful
*NL*
one
,
the
end
and
limit
of
all
human
beauty
!
Oh
,
ye
wood
nymphs
and
*NL*
dryads
,
that
dwell
in
the
thickets
of
the
forest
,
so
may
the
nimble
*NL*
wanton
satyrs
by
whom
ye
are
vainly
wooed
never
disturb
your
sweet
*NL*
repose
,
help
me
to
lament
my
hard
fate
or
at
least
weary
not
at
listening
*NL*
to
it
!
Oh
,
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
day
of
my
night
,
glory
of
my
pain
,
guide
*NL*
of
my
path
,
star
of
my
fortune
,
so
may
Heaven
grant
thee
in
full
all
thou
*NL*
seekest
of
it
,
bethink
thee
of
the
place
and
condition
to
which
absence
*NL*
from
thee
has
brought
me
,
and
make
that
return
in
kindness
that
is
due
to
*NL*
my
fidelity
!
Oh
,
lonely
trees
,
that
from
this
day
forward
shall
bear
me
*NL*
company
in
my
solitude
,
give
me
some
sign
by
the
gentle
movement
of
your
*NL*
boughs
that
my
presence
is
not
distasteful
to
you
!
Oh
,
thou
,
my
squire
,
*NL*
pleasant
companion
in
my
prosperous
and
adverse
fortunes
,
fix
well
in
thy
*NL*
memory
what
thou
shalt
see
me
do
here
,
so
that
thou
mayest
relate
and
*NL*
report
it
to
the
sole
cause
of
all
,
''
and
so
saying
he
dismounted
from
*NL*
Rocinante
,
and
in
an
instant
relieved
him
of
saddle
and
bridle
,
and
*NL*
giving
him
a
slap
on
the
croup
,
said
,
``
He
gives
thee
freedom
who
is
*NL*
bereft
of
it
himself
,
oh
steed
as
excellent
in
deed
as
thou
art
*NL*
unfortunate
in
thy
lot
;
begone
where
thou
wilt
,

thou
bearest
written
*NL*
on
thy
forehead
that
neither
Astolfo

hippogriff

the
famed
Frontino
*NL*

cost
Bradamante
so
dear

could
equal
thee
in

*NL*
Seeing
this
Sancho
said
,
``
Good
luck

him

has
saved
us
the

off

By
my
faith
he
would
not
have
*NL*
gone
without
a
slap
on
the
croup

something
said
in
his
praise
;
though
*NL*
if
he
were
here
I
would
not
let
anyone
strip
him
,
for
there
would
be
no
*NL*
occasion

he
had
nothing
of
the

victim
of
despair
about
him
,
*NL*
inasmuch
as
his
master
,
which
I
was

it
was

was

nothing

my
departure

your
worship

madness
are
to
come
off

it

will
be
as
well
to
saddle
Rocinante
again

order
that
he
may
supply
the
*NL*
want
of
Dapple

it
will
save
me
time
in
going

returning

I
go
on
foot
I
do
n't
know
when
I
shall
get
there

when
I
shall
get

back

am

in

a
bad
walker

*NL*

Much
thou

said
Don

``
I
have
now
got
to
tear

up
my

to
scatter
about
my
armour

knock
my

against
these

rocks

more
of

which
thou
must
witness

*NL*
*NL*

For

Sancho

across
such

that
the
very
first
may
put
an
end
to
the
whole
*NL*
contrivance
of
this
penance
;

I
should
think
,
if
indeed
knocks
on

necessary
to
you

this
business
can
not
be
done

is
feigned

against
something
soft

it
all
to
me
;

I
'll
tell

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
thee
for
thy
good
intentions

Sancho

answered
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
but
I
would
have
thee
know
that
all
these
things
I
am
doing
are
*NL*
not
in
joke

but
very
much
in
earnest
,
for
anything
else
would
be
a
*NL*
transgression
of
the
ordinances
of
chivalry
,
which
forbid
us
to
tell
any
*NL*
lie
whatever
under
the
penalties
due
to
apostasy
;
and
to
do
one
thing

instead
of
another
is
just
the
same
as
lying

so
my
knocks
on

must
be
real

solid

valid

without
anything
sophisticated

fanciful
about
them

it
will
be
needful

leave
me
some
lint

dress
my

do
without

worse
losing

Sancho

with

lint

accursed
liquor

turns
at
hearing
the

I
beg
of
you

to
reckon
as
past

three
days

allowed

thou

I
find
her
harder

with
her
sweet

will
come
back
through

*NL*
``
That

no

But
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
how
it
may
be
conveniently

*NL*
even
more
than
conveniently
written

that
is
in
the
note-book

comest
to

there
is
a

not

any
sacristan
will
copy

see
thou
give
it

not

all
very
well

I

*NL*

The

always

platonic

not
going
beyond
a

even
that
so
seldom

four

devour

perhaps
even
of
those
four
times
she
has
not
*NL*
once
perceived
that
I
was
looking
at

such
is
the
retirement

seclusion
in
which
her

the
whoreson
wench
,
what
sting
she
has
and
what
a
voice
!
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
one
day
she
posted
herself
on
the
top
of
the
belfry
of
the
village
to
*NL*
call
some
labourers
of
theirs
that
were
in
a
ploughed
field
of
her
*NL*
father
's
,
and
though
they
were
better
than
half
a
league
off
they
heard
*NL*
her
as
well
as
if
they
were
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
;
and
the
best
of
her
*NL*
is
that
she
is
not
a
bit
prudish
,
for
she
has
plenty
of
affability
,
and
*NL*
jokes
with
everybody
,
and
has
a
grin
and
a
jest
for
everything
.
So
,
Sir
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
I
say
you
not
only
may
and
ought
to
do
*NL*
mad
freaks
for
her
sake
,
but
you
have
a
good
right
to
give
way
to
despair
*NL*
and
hang
yourself
;
and
no
one
who
knows
of
it
but
will
say
you
did
well
,
*NL*
though
the
devil
should
take
you
;
and
I
wish
I
were
on
my
road
already
,
*NL*
simply
to
see
her
,
for
it
is
many
a
day
since
I
saw
her
,
and
she
must
be
*NL*
altered
by
this
time
,
for
going
about
the
fields
always
,
and
the
sun
and
*NL*
the
air
spoil
women
's
looks
greatly
.
But
I
must
own
the
truth
to
your
*NL*
worship
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
;
until
now
I
have
been
under
a
great
mistake
,
*NL*
for
I
believed
truly
and
honestly
that
the
lady
Dulcinea
must
be
some
*NL*
princess
your
worship
was
in
love
with
,
or
some
person
great
enough
to
*NL*
deserve
the
rich
presents
you
have
sent
her
,
such
as
the
Biscayan
and
the
*NL*
galley
slaves
,
and
many
more
no
doubt
,
for
your
worship
must
have
won
*NL*
many
victories
in
the
time
when
I
was
not
yet
your
squire
.
But
all
things
*NL*
considered
,
what
good
can
it
do
the
lady
Aldonza
Lorenzo
,
I
mean
the
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
to
have
the
vanquished
your
worship
sends
or
will
*NL*
send
coming
to
her
and
going
down
on
their
knees
before
her
?
Because
may
*NL*
be
when
they
came
she
'd
be
hackling
flax
or
threshing
on
the
threshing
*NL*
floor
,
and
they
'd
be
ashamed
to
see
her
,
and
she
'd
laugh
,
or
resent
the
*NL*
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
before
now
told
thee
many
times
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
*NL*
thou
art
a
mighty
great
chatterer
,
and
that
with
a
blunt
wit
thou
art
*NL*
always
striving
at
sharpness
;
but
to
show
thee
what
a
fool
thou
art
and
*NL*
how
rational
I
am
,
I
would
have
thee
listen
to
a
short
story
.
Thou
must
*NL*
know
that
a
certain
widow
,
fair
,
young
,
independent
,
and
rich
,
and
above
*NL*
all
free
and
easy
,
fell
in
love
with
a
sturdy
strapping
young
*NL*
lay-brother
;
his
superior
came
to
know
of
it
,
and
one
day
said
to
the
*NL*
worthy
widow
by
way
of
brotherly
remonstrance
,
'
I
am
surprised
,
senora
,
*NL*
and
not
without
good
reason
,
that
a
woman
of
such
high
standing
,
so
fair
,
*NL*
and
so
rich
as
you
are
,
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
such
a
mean
,
low
,
*NL*
stupid
fellow
as
So-and-so
,
when
in
this
house
there
are
so
many
masters
,
*NL*
graduates
,
and
divinity
students
from
among
whom
you
might
choose
as
if
*NL*
they
were
a
lot
of
pears
,
saying
this
one
I
'll
take
,
that
I
wo
n't
take
;
'
*NL*
but
she
replied
to
him
with
great
sprightliness
and
candour
,
`
My
dear
*NL*
sir
,
you
are
very
much
mistaken
,
and
your
ideas
are
very
old-fashioned
,
*NL*
if
you
think
that
I
have
made
a
bad
choice
in
So-and-so
,
fool
as
he
*NL*
seems
;
because
for
all
I
want
with
him
he
knows
as
much
and
more
*NL*
philosophy
than
Aristotle
.
'
In
the
same
way
,
Sancho
,
for
all
I
want
with
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
she
is
just
as
good
as
the
most
exalted
princess
on
*NL*
earth
.
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
all
those
poets
who
sang
the
praises
*NL*
of
ladies
under
the
fancy
names
they
give
them
,
had
any
such
mistresses
.
*NL*
Thinkest
thou
that
the
Amarillises
,
the
Phillises
,
the
Sylvias
,
the
*NL*
Dianas
,
the
Galateas
,
the
Filidas
,
and
all
the
rest
of
them
,
that
the
*NL*
books
,
the
ballads
,
the
barber
's
shops
,
the
theatres
are
full
of
,
were
*NL*
really
and
truly
ladies
of
flesh
and
blood
,
and
mistresses
of
those
that
*NL*
glorify
and
have
glorified
them
?
Nothing
of
the
kind
;
they
only
invent
*NL*
them
for
the
most
part
to
furnish
a
subject
for
their
verses
,
and
that
*NL*
they
may
pass
for
lovers
,
or
for
men
valiant
enough
to
be
so
;
and
so
it
*NL*
suffices
me
to
think
and
believe
that
the
good
Aldonza
Lorenzo
is
fair
*NL*
and
virtuous
;
and
as
to
her
pedigree
it
is
very
little
matter
,
for
no
one
*NL*
will
examine
into
it
for
the
purpose
of
conferring
any
order
upon
her
,
*NL*
and
I
,
for
my
part
,
reckon
her
the
most
exalted
princess
in
the
world
.
*NL*
For
thou
shouldst
know
,
Sancho
,
if
thou
dost
not
know
,
that
two
things
*NL*
alone
beyond
all
others
are
incentives
to
love
,
and
these
are
great
*NL*
beauty
and
a
good
name
,
and
these
two
things
are
to
be
found
in
Dulcinea
*NL*
in
the
highest
degree
,
for
in
beauty
no
one
equals
her
and
in
good
name
*NL*
few
approach
her
;
and
to
put
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
,
I
persuade
*NL*
myself
that
all
I
say
is
as
I
say
,
neither
more
nor
less
,
and
I
picture
*NL*
her
in
my
imagination
as
I
would
have
her
to
be
,
as
well
in
beauty
as
in
*NL*
condition
;
Helen
approaches
her
not
nor
does
Lucretia
come
up
to
her
,
nor
*NL*
any
other
of
the
famous
women
of
times
past
,
Greek
,
Barbarian
,
or
Latin
;
*NL*
and
let
each
say
what
he
will
,
for
if
in
this
I
am
taken
to
task
by
the
*NL*
ignorant
,
I
shall
not
be
censured
by
the
critical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
that
your
worship
is
entirely
right
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
that
I
am
*NL*
an
ass
.
But
I
know
not
how
the
name
of
ass
came
into
my
mouth
,
for
a
rope
*NL*
is
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
house
of
him
who
has
been
hanged
;
but
now
*NL*
for
the
letter
,
and
then
,
God
be
with
you
,
I
am
off

''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
took
out
the
note-book
,
and
,
retiring
to
one
side
,
very
*NL*
deliberately
began
to
write
the
letter
,
and
when
he
had
finished
it
he
*NL*
called
to
Sancho
,
saying
he
wished
to
read
it
to
him
,
so
that
he
might
*NL*
commit
it
to
memory
,
in
case
of
losing
it
on
the
road
;
for
with
evil
*NL*
fortune
like
his
anything
might
be
apprehended
.
To
which
Sancho
replied
,
*NL*
``
Write
it
two
or
three
times
there
in
the
book
and
give
it
to
me
,
and
I
*NL*
will
carry
it
very
carefully
,
because
to
expect
me
to
keep
it
in
my
*NL*
memory
is
all
nonsense
,
for
I
have
such
a
bad
one
that
I
often
forget
my
*NL*
own
name
;
but
for
all
that
repeat
it
to
me
,
as
I
shall
like
to
hear
it
,
*NL*
for
surely
it
will
run
as
if
it
was
in
print

to
find
my
way
back
to
this
spot
where
I
am
leaving
you
,
it
*NL*
is
such
an
out-of-the-way
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Observe
the
landmarks
well
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
I
will
try
not
to
go
*NL*
far
from
this
neighbourhood
,
and
I
will
even
take
care
to
mount
the
*NL*
highest
of
these
rocks
to
see
if
I
can
discover
thee
returning
;
however
,
*NL*
not
to
miss
me
and
lose
thyself
,
the
best
plan
will
be
to
cut
some
*NL*
branches
of
the
broom
that
is
so
abundant
about
here
,
and
as
thou
goest
*NL*
to
lay
them
at
intervals
until
thou
hast
come
out
upon
the
plain
;
these
*NL*
will
serve
thee
,
after
the
fashion
of
the
clue
in
the
labyrinth
of
*NL*
Theseus
,
as
marks
and
signs
for
finding
me
on
thy
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
will
,
''
said
Sancho
Panza
,
and
having
cut
some
,
he
asked
his
*NL*
master
's
blessing
,
and
not
without
many
tears
on
both
sides
,
took
his
*NL*
leave
of
him
,
and
mounting
Rocinante
,
of
whom
Don
Quixote
charged
him
*NL*
earnestly
to
have
as
much
care
as
of
his
own
person
,
he
set
out
for
the
*NL*
plain
,
strewing
at
intervals
the
branches
of
broom
as
his
master
had
*NL*
recommended
him
;
and
so
he
went
his
way
,
though
Don
Quixote
still
*NL*
entreated
him
to
see
him
do
were
it
only
a
couple
of
mad
acts
.
He
had
not
*NL*
gone
a
hundred
paces
,
however
,
when
he
returned
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
,
senor
,
your
worship
said
quite
right
,
that
in
order
to
be
*NL*
able
to
swear
without
a
weight
on
my
conscience
that
I
had
seen
you
do
*NL*
mad
things
,
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
see
if
it
were
only
one
;
though
in
*NL*
your
worship
's
remaining
here
I
have
seen
a
very
great
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
not
tell
thee
so
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
``
Wait
,
Sancho
,
and
I
will
do
*NL*
them
in
the
saying
of
a
credo
,
''
and
pulling
off
his
breeches
in
all
haste
*NL*
he
stripped
himself
to
his
skin
and
his
shirt
,
and
then
,
without
more
*NL*
ado
,
he
cut
a
couple
of
gambados
in
the
air
,
and
a
couple
of
somersaults
,
*NL*
heels
over
head
,
making
such
a
display
that
,
not
to
see
it
a
second
time
,
*NL*
Sancho
wheeled
Rocinante
round
,
and
felt
easy
,
and
satisfied
in
his
mind
*NL*
that
he
could
swear
he
had
left
his
master
mad
;
and
so
we
will
leave
him
*NL*
to
follow
his
road
until
his
return
,
which
was
a
quick
one
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
ARE
CONTINUED
THE
REFINEMENTS
WHEREWITH
DON
QUIXOTE
PLAYED
THE
*NL*
PART
OF
A
LOVER
IN
THE
SIERRA
MORENA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Returning
to
the
proceedings
of
him
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
when
he
*NL*
found
himself
alone
,
the
history
says
that
when
Don
Quixote
had
completed
*NL*
the
performance
of
the
somersaults
or
capers
,
naked
from
the
waist
down
*NL*
and
clothed
from
the
waist
up
,
and
saw
that
Sancho
had
gone
off
without
*NL*
waiting
to
see
any
more
crazy
feats
,
he
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
a
high
*NL*
rock
,
and
there
set
himself
to
consider
what
he
had
several
times
before
*NL*
considered
without
ever
coming
to
any
conclusion
on
the
point
,
namely
*NL*
whether
it
would
be
better
and
more
to
his
purpose
to
imitate
the
*NL*
outrageous
madness
of
Roland
,
or
the
melancholy
madness
of
Amadis
;
and
*NL*
communing
with
himself
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
wonder
is
it
if
Roland
was
so
good
a
knight
and
so
valiant
as
*NL*
everyone
says
he
was
,
when
,
after
all
,
he
was
enchanted
,
and
nobody
could
*NL*
kill
him
save
by
thrusting
a
corking
pin
into
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
and
*NL*
he
always
wore
shoes
with
seven
iron
soles
?
Though
cunning
devices
did
*NL*
not
avail
him
against
Bernardo
del
Carpio
,
who
knew
all
about
them
,
and
*NL*
strangled
him
in
his
arms
at
Roncesvalles
.
But
putting
the
question
of
*NL*
his
valour
aside
,
let
us
come
to
his
losing
his
wits
,
for
certain
it
is
*NL*
that
he
did
lose
them
in
consequence
of
the
proofs
he
discovered
at
the
*NL*
fountain
,
and
the
intelligence
the
shepherd
gave
him
of
Angelica
having
*NL*
slept
more
than
two
siestas
with
Medoro
,
a
little
curly-headed
Moor
,
and
*NL*
page
to
Agramante
.
If
he
was
persuaded
that
this
was
true
,
and
that
his
*NL*
lady
had
wronged
him
,
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
should
have
gone
mad
;
but
*NL*
I
,
how
am
I
to
imitate
him
in
his
madness
,
unless
I
can
imitate
him
in
*NL*
the
cause
of
it
?
For
my
Dulcinea
,
I
will
venture
to
swear
,
never
saw
a
*NL*
Moor
in
her
life
,
as
he
is
,
in
his
proper
costume
,
and
she
is
this
day
as
*NL*
the
mother
that
bore
her
,
and
I
should
plainly
be
doing
her
a
wrong
if
,
*NL*
fancying
anything
else
,
I
were
to
go
mad
with
the
same
kind
of
madness
as
*NL*
Roland
the
Furious
.
On
the
other
hand
,
I
see
that
Amadis
of
Gaul
,
without
*NL*
losing
his
senses
and
without
doing
anything
mad
,
acquired
as
a
lover
as
*NL*
much
fame
as
the
most
famous
;
for
,
according
to
his
history
,
on
finding
*NL*
himself
rejected
by
his
lady
Oriana
,
who
had
ordered
him
not
to
appear
in
*NL*
her
presence
until
it
should
be
her
pleasure
,
all
he
did
was
to
retire
to
*NL*
the
Pena
Pobre
in
company
with
a
hermit
,
and
there
he
took
his
fill
of
*NL*
weeping
until
Heaven
sent
him
relief
in
the
midst
of
his
great
grief
and
*NL*
need
.
And
if
this
be
true
,
as
it
is
,
why
should
I
now
take
the
trouble
to
*NL*
strip
stark
naked
,
or
do
mischief
to
these
trees
which
have
done
me
no
*NL*
harm
,
or
why
am
I
to
disturb
the
clear
waters
of
these
brooks
which
will
*NL*
give
me
to
drink
whenever
I
have
a
mind
?
Long
live
the
memory
of
Amadis
*NL*
and
let
him
be
imitated
so
far
as
is
possible
by
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
of
whom
it
will
be
said
,
as
was
said
of
the
other
,
that
if
he
did
*NL*
not
achieve
great
things
,
he
died
in
attempting
them
;
and
if
I
am
not
*NL*
repulsed
or
rejected
by
my
Dulcinea
,
it
is
enough
for
me
,
as
I
have
said
,
*NL*
to
be
absent
from
her
.
And
so
,
now
to
business
;
come
to
my
memory
ye
*NL*
deeds
of
Amadis
,
and
show
me
how
I
am
to
begin
to
imitate
you
.
I
know
*NL*
already
that
what
he
chiefly
did
was
to
pray
and
commend
himself
to
God
;
*NL*
but
what
am
I
to
do
for
a
rosary
,
for
I
have
not
got
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
it
occurred
to
him
how
he
might
make
one
,
and
that
was
by
*NL*
tearing
a
great
strip
off
the
tail
of
his
shirt
which
hung
down
,
and
*NL*
making
eleven
knots
on
it
,
one
bigger
than
the
rest
,
and
this
served
him
*NL*
for
a
rosary
all
the
time
he
was
there
,
during
which
he
repeated
*NL*
countless
ave-marias
.
But
what
distressed
him
greatly
was
not
having
*NL*
another
hermit
there
to
confess
him
and
receive
consolation
from
;
and
so
*NL*
he
solaced
himself
with
pacing
up
and
down
the
little
meadow
,
and
writing
*NL*
and
carving
on
the
bark
of
the
trees
and
on
the
fine
sand
a
multitude
of
*NL*
verses
all
in
harmony
with
his
sadness
,
and
some
in
praise
of
Dulcinea
;
*NL*
but
,
when
he
was
found
there
afterwards
,
the
only
ones
completely
legible
*NL*
that
could
be
discovered
were
those
that
follow
here
:
*NL*
*NL*
Ye
on
the
mountain
side
that
grow
,
*NL*
Ye
green
things
all
,
trees
,
shrubs
,
and
bushes
,
*NL*
Are
ye
aweary
of
the
woe
*NL*
That
this
poor
aching
bosom
crushes
?
*NL*
If
it
disturb
you
,
and
I
owe
*NL*
Some
reparation
,
it
may
be
a
*NL*
Defence
for
me
to
let
you
know
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
tears
are
on
the
flow
,
*NL*
And
all
for
distant
Dulcinea
*NL*
Del
Toboso
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lealest
lover
time
can
show
,
*NL*
Doomed
for
a
lady-love
to
languish
,
*NL*
Among
these
solitudes
doth
go
,
*NL*
A
prey
to
every
kind
of
anguish
.
*NL*
Why
Love
should
like
a
spiteful
foe
*NL*
Thus
use
him
,
he
hath
no
idea
,
*NL*
But
hogsheads
full
--
this
doth
he
know
--
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
tears
are
on
the
flow
,
*NL*
And
all
for
distant
Dulcinea
*NL*
Del
Toboso
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adventure-seeking
doth
he
go
*NL*
Up
rugged
heights
,
down
rocky
valleys
,
*NL*
But
hill
or
dale
,
or
high
or
low
,
*NL*
Mishap
attendeth
all
his
sallies
:
*NL*
Love
still
pursues
him
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
And
plies
his
cruel
scourge
--
ah
me
!
a
*NL*
Relentless
fate
,
an
endless
woe
;
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
tears
are
on
the
flow
,
*NL*
And
all
for
distant
Dulcinea
*NL*
Del
Toboso
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
addition
of
``
Del
Toboso
''
to
Dulcinea
's
name
gave
rise
to
no
little
*NL*
laughter
among
those
who
found
the
above
lines
,
for
they
suspected
Don
*NL*
Quixote
must
have
fancied
that
unless
he
added
``
del
Toboso
''
when
he
*NL*
introduced
the
name
of
Dulcinea
the
verse
would
be
unintelligible
;
which
*NL*
was
indeed
the
fact
,
as
he
himself
afterwards
admitted
.
He
wrote
many
*NL*
more
,
but
,
as
has
been
said
,
these
three
verses
were
all
that
could
be
*NL*
plainly
and
perfectly
deciphered
.
In
this
way
,
and
in
sighing
and
calling
*NL*
on
the
fauns
and
satyrs
of
the
woods
and
the
nymphs
of
the
streams
,
and
*NL*
Echo
,
moist
and
mournful
,
to
answer
,
console
,
and
hear
him
,
as
well
as
in
*NL*
looking
for
herbs
to
sustain
him
,
he
passed
his
time
until
Sancho
's
*NL*
return
;
and
had
that
been
delayed
three
weeks
,
as
it
was
three
days
,
the
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
would
have
worn
such
an
altered
*NL*
countenance
that
the
mother
that
bore
him
would
not
have
known
him
:
and
*NL*
here
it
will
be
well
to
leave
him
,
wrapped
up
in
sighs
and
verses
,
to
*NL*
relate
how
Sancho
Panza
fared
on
his
mission
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
him
,
coming
out
upon
the
high
road
,
he
made
for
El
Toboso
,
and
the
*NL*
next
day
reached
the
inn
where
the
mishap
of
the
blanket
had
befallen
*NL*
him
.
As
soon
as
he
recognised
it
he
felt
as
if
he
were
once
more
living
*NL*
through
the
air
,
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
enter
it
though
it
was
*NL*
an
hour
when
he
might
well
have
done
so
,
for
it
was
dinner-time
,
and
he
*NL*
longed
to
taste
something
hot
as
it
had
been
all
cold
fare
with
him
for
*NL*
many
days
past
.
This
craving
drove
him
to
draw
near
to
the
inn
,
still
*NL*
undecided
whether
to
go
in
or
not
,
and
as
he
was
hesitating
there
came
*NL*
out
two
persons
who
at
once
recognised
him
,
and
said
one
to
the
other
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
licentiate
,
is
not
he
on
the
horse
there
Sancho
Panza
who
,
our
*NL*
adventurer
's
housekeeper
told
us
,
went
off
with
her
master
as
esquire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
,
''
said
the
licentiate
,
``
and
that
is
our
friend
Don
Quixote
's
*NL*
horse
;
''
and
if
they
knew
him
so
well
it
was
because
they
were
the
curate
*NL*
and
the
barber
of
his
own
village
,
the
same
who
had
carried
out
the
*NL*
scrutiny
and
sentence
upon
the
books
;
and
as
soon
as
they
recognised
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
and
Rocinante
,
being
anxious
to
hear
of
Don
Quixote
,
they
*NL*
approached
,
and
calling
him
by
his
name
the
curate
said
,
``
Friend
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
,
where
is
your
master
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
recognised
them
at
once
,
and
determined
to
keep
secret
the
place
*NL*
and
circumstances
where
and
under
which
he
had
left
his
master
,
so
he
*NL*
replied
that
his
master
was
engaged
in
a
certain
quarter
on
a
certain
*NL*
matter
of
great
importance
to
him
which
he
could
not
disclose
for
the
*NL*
eyes
in
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
if
you
do
n't
tell
us
where
he
is
,
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
,
we
will
suspect
as
we
suspect
already
,
that
you
have
murdered
and
*NL*
robbed
him
,
for
here
you
are
mounted
on
his
horse
;
in
fact
,
you
must
*NL*
produce
the
master
of
the
hack
,
or
else
take
the
consequences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
need
of
threats
with
me
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
I
am
not
a
man
*NL*
to
rob
or
murder
anybody
;
let
his
own
fate
,
or
God
who
made
him
,
kill
*NL*
each
one
;
my
master
is
engaged
very
much
to
his
taste
doing
penance
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
these
mountains
;
''
and
then
,
offhand
and
without
stopping
,
he
*NL*
told
them
how
he
had
left
him
,
what
adventures
had
befallen
him
,
and
how
*NL*
he
was
carrying
a
letter
to
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
the
daughter
of
*NL*
Lorenzo
Corchuelo
,
with
whom
he
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
.
They
were
*NL*
both
amazed
at
what
Sancho
Panza
told
them
;
for
though
they
were
aware
of
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
madness
and
the
nature
of
it
,
each
time
they
heard
of
it
*NL*
they
were
filled
with
fresh
wonder
.
They
then
asked
Sancho
Panza
to
show
*NL*
them
the
letter
he
was
carrying
to
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
.
He
said
*NL*
it
was
written
in
a
note-book
,
and
that
his
master
's
directions
were
that
*NL*
he
should
have
it
copied
on
paper
at
the
first
village
he
came
to
.
On
*NL*
this
the
curate
said
if
he
showed
it
to
him
,
he
himself
would
make
a
fair
*NL*
copy
of
it
.
Sancho
put
his
hand
into
his
bosom
in
search
of
the
note-book
*NL*
but
could
not
find
it
,
nor
,
if
he
had
been
searching
until
now
,
could
he
*NL*
have
found
it
,
for
Don
Quixote
had
kept
it
,
and
had
never
given
it
to
*NL*
him
,
nor
had
he
himself
thought
of
asking
for
it
.
When
Sancho
discovered
*NL*
he
could
not
find
the
book
his
face
grew
deadly
pale
,
and
in
great
haste
*NL*
he
again
felt
his
body
all
over
,
and
seeing
plainly
it
was
not
to
be
*NL*
found
,
without
more
ado
he
seized
his
beard
with
both
hands
and
plucked
*NL*
away
half
of
it
,
and
then
,
as
quick
as
he
could
and
without
stopping
,
*NL*
gave
himself
half
a
dozen
cuffs
on
the
face
and
nose
till
they
were
*NL*
bathed
in
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
this
,
the
curate
and
the
barber
asked
him
what
had
happened
him
*NL*
that
he
gave
himself
such
rough
treatment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
happen
me
?
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
but
to
have
lost
from
one
hand
*NL*
to
the
other
,
in
a
moment
,
three
ass-colts
,
each
of
them
like
a
castle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
?
''
said
the
barber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
lost
the
note-book
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
contained
the
letter
to
*NL*
Dulcinea
,
and
an
order
signed
by
my
master
in
which
he
directed
his
niece
*NL*
to
give
me
three
ass-colts
out
of
four
or
five
he
had
at
home
;
''
and
he
*NL*
then
told
them
about
the
loss
of
Dapple
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
consoled
him
,
telling
him
that
when
his
master
was
found
he
*NL*
would
get
him
to
renew
the
order
,
and
make
a
fresh
draft
on
paper
,
as
was
*NL*
usual
and
customary
;
for
those
made
in
notebooks
were
never
accepted
or
*NL*
honoured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
comforted
himself
with
this
,
and
said
if
that
were
so
the
loss
of
*NL*
Dulcinea
's
letter
did
not
trouble
him
much
,
for
he
had
it
almost
by
*NL*
heart
,
and
it
could
be
taken
down
from
him
wherever
and
whenever
they
*NL*
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Repeat
it
then
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
and
we
will
write
it
down
*NL*
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
stopped
to
scratch
his
head
to
bring
back
the
letter
to
his
*NL*
memory
,
and
balanced
himself
now
on
one
foot
,
now
the
other
,
one
moment
*NL*
staring
at
the
ground
,
the
next
at
the
sky
,
and
after
having
half
gnawed
*NL*
off
the
end
of
a
finger
and
kept
them
in
suspense
waiting
for
him
to
*NL*
begin
,
he
said
,
after
a
long
pause
,
``
By
God
,
senor
licentiate
,
devil
a
*NL*
thing
can
I
recollect
of
the
letter
;
but
it
said
at
the
beginning
,
*NL*
`
Exalted
and
scrubbing
Lady
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
have
said
`
scrubbing
,
'
''
said
the
barber
,
``
but
`
superhuman
'
or
*NL*
`
sovereign
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
it
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
then
,
as
well
as
I
remember
,
it
went
on
,
`
The
*NL*
wounded
,
and
wanting
of
sleep
,
and
the
pierced
,
kisses
your
worship
's
*NL*
hands
,
ungrateful
and
very
unrecognised
fair
one
;
and
it
said
something
*NL*
or
other
about
health
and
sickness
that
he
was
sending
her
;
and
from
that
*NL*
it
went
tailing
off
until
it
ended
with
`
Yours
till
death
,
the
Knight
of
*NL*
the
Rueful
Countenance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
gave
them
no
little
amusement
,
both
of
them
,
to
see
what
a
good
memory
*NL*
Sancho
had
,
and
they
complimented
him
greatly
upon
it
,
and
begged
him
to
*NL*
repeat
the
letter
a
couple
of
times
more
,
so
that
they
too
might
get
it
*NL*
by
heart
to
write
it
out
by-and-by
.
Sancho
repeated
it
three
times
,
and
*NL*
as
he
did
,
uttered
three
thousand
more
absurdities
;
then
he
told
them
*NL*
more
about
his
master
but
he
never
said
a
word
about
the
blanketing
that
*NL*
had
befallen
himself
in
that
inn
,
into
which
he
refused
to
enter
.
He
told
*NL*
them
,
moreover
,
how
his
lord
,
if
he
brought
him
a
favourable
answer
from
*NL*
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
was
to
put
himself
in
the
way
of
*NL*
endeavouring
to
become
an
emperor
,
or
at
least
a
monarch
;
for
it
had
been
*NL*
so
settled
between
them
,
and
with
his
personal
worth
and
the
might
of
his
*NL*
arm
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
come
to
be
one
:
and
how
on
becoming
one
his
*NL*
lord
was
to
make
a
marriage
for
him
-LRB-
for
he
would
be
a
widower
by
that
*NL*
time
,
as
a
matter
of
course
-RRB-
and
was
to
give
him
as
a
wife
one
of
the
*NL*
damsels
of
the
empress
,
the
heiress
of
some
rich
and
grand
state
on
the
*NL*
mainland
,
having
nothing
to
do
with
islands
of
any
sort
,
for
he
did
not
*NL*
care
for
them
now
.
All
this
Sancho
delivered
with
so
much
*NL*
composure
--
wiping
his
nose
from
time
to
time
--
and
with
so
little
*NL*
common-sense
that
his
two
hearers
were
again
filled
with
wonder
at
the
*NL*
force
of
Don
Quixote
's
madness
that
could
run
away
with
this
poor
man
's
*NL*
reason
.
They
did
not
care
to
take
the
trouble
of
disabusing
him
of
his
*NL*
error
,
as
they
considered
that
since
it
did
not
in
any
way
hurt
his
*NL*
conscience
it
would
be
better
to
leave
him
in
it
,
and
they
would
have
all
*NL*
the
more
amusement
in
listening
to
his
simplicities
;
and
so
they
bade
him
*NL*
pray
to
God
for
his
lord
's
health
,
as
it
was
a
very
likely
and
a
very
*NL*
feasible
thing
for
him
in
course
of
time
to
come
to
be
an
emperor
,
as
he
*NL*
said
,
or
at
least
an
archbishop
or
some
other
dignitary
of
equal
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
made
answer
,
``
If
fortune
,
sirs
,
should
bring
things
about
*NL*
in
such
a
way
that
my
master
should
have
a
mind
,
instead
of
being
an
*NL*
emperor
,
to
be
an
archbishop
,
I
should
like
to
know
what
*NL*
archbishops-errant
commonly
give
their
squires
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
commonly
give
them
,
''
said
the
curate
,
some
simple
benefice
or
cure
,
*NL*
or
some
place
as
sacristan
which
brings
them
a
good
fixed
income
,
not
*NL*
counting
the
altar
fees
,
which
may
be
reckoned
at
as
much
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
that
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
the
squire
must
be
unmarried
,
and
must
*NL*
know
,
at
any
rate
,
how
to
help
at
mass
,
and
if
that
be
so
,
woe
is
me
,
for
*NL*
I
am
married
already
and
I
do
n't
know
the
first
letter
of
the
A
B
C
.
What
*NL*
will
become
of
me
if
my
master
takes
a
fancy
to
be
an
archbishop
and
not
*NL*
an
emperor
,
as
is
usual
and
customary
with
knights-errant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
uneasy
,
friend
Sancho
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
for
we
will
entreat
*NL*
your
master
,
and
advise
him
,
even
urging
it
upon
him
as
a
case
of
*NL*
conscience
,
to
become
an
emperor
and
not
an
archbishop
,
because
it
will
*NL*
be
easier
for
him
as
he
is
more
valiant
than
lettered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
have
thought
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
though
I
can
tell
you
he
is
fit
for
*NL*
anything
:
what
I
mean
to
do
for
my
part
is
to
pray
to
our
Lord
to
place
*NL*
him
where
it
may
be
best
for
him
,
and
where
he
may
be
able
to
bestow
most
*NL*
favours
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
like
a
man
of
sense
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
and
you
will
be
acting
*NL*
like
a
good
Christian
;
but
what
must
now
be
done
is
to
take
steps
to
coax
*NL*
your
master
out
of
that
useless
penance
you
say
he
is
performing
;
and
we
*NL*
had
best
turn
into
this
inn
to
consider
what
plan
to
adopt
,
and
also
to
*NL*
dine
,
for
it
is
now
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
said
they
might
go
in
,
but
that
he
would
wait
there
outside
,
and
*NL*
that
he
would
tell
them
afterwards
the
reason
why
he
was
unwilling
,
and
*NL*
why
it
did
not
suit
him
to
enter
it
;
but
he
begged
them
to
bring
him
out
*NL*
something
to
eat
,
and
to
let
it
be
hot
,
and
also
to
bring
barley
for
*NL*
Rocinante
.
They
left
him
and
went
in
,
and
presently
the
barber
brought
*NL*
him
out
something
to
eat
.
By-and-by
,
after
they
had
between
them
*NL*
carefully
thought
over
what
they
should
do
to
carry
out
their
object
,
the
*NL*
curate
hit
upon
an
idea
very
well
adapted
to
humour
Don
Quixote
,
and
*NL*
effect
their
purpose
;
and
his
notion
,
which
he
explained
to
the
barber
,
*NL*
was
that
he
himself
should
assume
the
disguise
of
a
wandering
damsel
,
*NL*
while
the
other
should
try
as
best
he
could
to
pass
for
a
squire
,
and
*NL*
that
they
should
thus
proceed
to
where
Don
Quixote
was
,
and
he
,
*NL*
pretending
to
be
an
aggrieved
and
distressed
damsel
,
should
ask
a
favour
*NL*
of
him
,
which
as
a
valiant
knight-errant
he
could
not
refuse
to
grant
;
*NL*
and
the
favour
he
meant
to
ask
him
was
that
he
should
accompany
her
*NL*
whither
she
would
conduct
him
,
in
order
to
redress
a
wrong
which
a
wicked
*NL*
knight
had
done
her
,
while
at
the
same
time
she
should
entreat
him
not
to
*NL*
require
her
to
remove
her
mask
,
nor
ask
her
any
question
touching
her
*NL*
circumstances
until
he
had
righted
her
with
the
wicked
knight
.
And
he
had
*NL*
no
doubt
that
Don
Quixote
would
comply
with
any
request
made
in
these
*NL*
terms
,
and
that
in
this
way
they
might
remove
him
and
take
him
to
his
own
*NL*
village
,
where
they
would
endeavour
to
find
out
if
his
extraordinary
*NL*
madness
admitted
of
any
kind
of
remedy
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
HOW
THE
CURATE
AND
THE
BARBER
PROCEEDED
WITH
THEIR
SCHEME
;
TOGETHER
*NL*
WITH
OTHER
MATTERS
WORTHY
OF
RECORD
IN
THIS
GREAT
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
's
plan
did
not
seem
a
bad
one
to
the
barber
,
but
on
the
*NL*
contrary
so
good
that
they
immediately
set
about
putting
it
in
execution
.
*NL*
They
begged
a
petticoat
and
hood
of
the
landlady
,
leaving
her
in
pledge
a
*NL*
new
cassock
of
the
curate
's
;
and
the
barber
made
a
beard
out
of
a
*NL*
grey-brown
or
red
ox-tail
in
which
the
landlord
used
to
stick
his
comb
.
*NL*
The
landlady
asked
them
what
they
wanted
these
things
for
,
and
the
curate
*NL*
told
her
in
a
few
words
about
the
madness
of
Don
Quixote
,
and
how
this
*NL*
disguise
was
intended
to
get
him
away
from
the
mountain
where
he
then
*NL*
was
.
The
landlord
and
landlady
immediately
came
to
the
conclusion
that
*NL*
the
madman
was
their
guest
,
the
balsam
man
and
master
of
the
blanketed
*NL*
squire
,
and
they
told
the
curate
all
that
had
passed
between
him
and
*NL*
them
,
not
omitting
what
Sancho
had
been
so
silent
about
.
Finally
the
*NL*
landlady
dressed
up
the
curate
in
a
style
that
left
nothing
to
be
*NL*
desired
;
she
put
on
him
a
cloth
petticoat
with
black
velvet
stripes
a
*NL*
palm
broad
,
all
slashed
,
and
a
bodice
of
green
velvet
set
off
by
a
*NL*
binding
of
white
satin
,
which
as
well
as
the
petticoat
must
have
been
*NL*
made
in
the
time
of
king
Wamba
.
The
curate
would
not
let
them
hood
him
,
*NL*
but
put
on
his
head
a
little
quilted
linen
cap
which
he
used
for
a
*NL*
night-cap
,
and
bound
his
forehead
with
a
strip
of
black
silk
,
while
with
*NL*
another
he
made
a
mask
with
which
he
concealed
his
beard
and
face
very
*NL*
well
.
He
then
put
on
his
hat
,
which
was
broad
enough
to
serve
him
for
an
*NL*
umbrella
,
and
enveloping
himself
in
his
cloak
seated
himself
*NL*
woman-fashion
on
his
mule
,
while
the
barber
mounted
his
with
a
beard
down
*NL*
to
the
waist
of
mingled
red
and
white
,
for
it
was
,
as
has
been
said
,
the
*NL*
tail
of
a
clay-red
ox
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
took
leave
of
all
,
and
of
the
good
Maritornes
,
who
,
sinner
as
she
*NL*
was
,
promised
to
pray
a
rosary
of
prayers
that
God
might
grant
them
*NL*
success
in
such
an
arduous
and
Christian
undertaking
as
that
they
had
in
*NL*
hand
.
But
hardly
had
he
sallied
forth
from
the
inn
when
it
struck
the
*NL*
curate
that
he
was
doing
wrong
in
rigging
himself
out
in
that
fashion
,
as
*NL*
it
was
an
indecorous
thing
for
a
priest
to
dress
himself
that
way
even
*NL*
though
much
might
depend
upon
it
;
and
saying
so
to
the
barber
he
begged
*NL*
him
to
change
dresses
,
as
it
was
fitter
he
should
be
the
distressed
*NL*
damsel
,
while
he
himself
would
play
the
squire
's
part
,
which
would
be
*NL*
less
derogatory
to
his
dignity
;
otherwise
he
was
resolved
to
have
nothing
*NL*
more
to
do
with
the
matter
,
and
let
the
devil
take
Don
Quixote
.
Just
at
*NL*
this
moment
Sancho
came
up
,
and
on
seeing
the
pair
in
such
a
costume
he
*NL*
was
unable
to
restrain
his
laughter
;
the
barber
,
however
,
agreed
to
do
as
*NL*
the
curate
wished
,
and
,
altering
their
plan
,
the
curate
went
on
to
*NL*
instruct
him
how
to
play
his
part
and
what
to
say
to
Don
Quixote
to
*NL*
induce
and
compel
him
to
come
with
them
and
give
up
his
fancy
for
the
*NL*
place
he
had
chosen
for
his
idle
penance
.
The
barber
told
him
he
could
*NL*
manage
it
properly
without
any
instruction
,
and
as
he
did
not
care
to
*NL*
dress
himself
up
until
they
were
near
where
Don
Quixote
was
,
he
folded
up
*NL*
the
garments
,
and
the
curate
adjusted
his
beard
,
and
they
set
out
under
*NL*
the
guidance
of
Sancho
Panza
,
who
went
along
telling
them
of
the
*NL*
encounter
with
the
madman
they
met
in
the
Sierra
,
saying
nothing
,
*NL*
however
,
about
the
finding
of
the
valise
and
its
contents
;
for
with
all
*NL*
his
simplicity
the
lad
was
a
trifle
covetous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
they
reached
the
place
where
Sancho
had
laid
the
*NL*
broom-branches
as
marks
to
direct
him
to
where
he
had
left
his
master
,
*NL*
and
recognising
it
he
told
them
that
here
was
the
entrance
,
and
that
they
*NL*
would
do
well
to
dress
themselves
,
if
that
was
required
to
deliver
his
*NL*
master
;
for
they
had
already
told
him
that
going
in
this
guise
and
*NL*
dressing
in
this
way
were
of
the
highest
importance
in
order
to
rescue
*NL*
his
master
from
the
pernicious
life
he
had
adopted
;
and
they
charged
him
*NL*
strictly
not
to
tell
his
master
who
they
were
,
or
that
he
knew
them
,
and
*NL*
should
he
ask
,
as
ask
he
would
,
if
he
had
given
the
letter
to
Dulcinea
,
*NL*
to
say
that
he
had
,
and
that
,
as
she
did
not
know
how
to
read
,
she
had
*NL*
given
an
answer
by
word
of
mouth
,
saying
that
she
commanded
him
,
on
pain
*NL*
of
her
displeasure
,
to
come
and
see
her
at
once
;
and
it
was
a
very
*NL*
important
matter
for
himself
,
because
in
this
way
and
with
what
they
*NL*
meant
to
say
to
him
they
felt
sure
of
bringing
him
back
to
a
better
mode
*NL*
of
life
and
inducing
him
to
take
immediate
steps
to
become
an
emperor
or
*NL*
monarch
,
for
there
was
no
fear
of
his
becoming
an
archbishop
.
All
this
*NL*
Sancho
listened
to
and
fixed
it
well
in
his
memory
,
and
thanked
them
*NL*
heartily
for
intending
to
recommend
his
master
to
be
an
emperor
instead
*NL*
of
an
archbishop
,
for
he
felt
sure
that
in
the
way
of
bestowing
rewards
*NL*
on
their
squires
emperors
could
do
more
than
archbishops-errant
.
He
said
,
*NL*
too
,
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
him
to
go
on
before
them
to
find
him
,
*NL*
and
give
him
his
lady
's
answer
;
for
that
perhaps
might
be
enough
to
bring
*NL*
him
away
from
the
place
without
putting
them
to
all
this
trouble
.
They
*NL*
approved
of
what
Sancho
proposed
,
and
resolved
to
wait
for
him
until
he
*NL*
brought
back
word
of
having
found
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
pushed
on
into
the
glens
of
the
Sierra
,
leaving
them
in
one
*NL*
through
which
there
flowed
a
little
gentle
rivulet
,
and
where
the
rocks
*NL*
and
trees
afforded
a
cool
and
grateful
shade
.
It
was
an
August
day
with
*NL*
all
the
heat
of
one
,
and
the
heat
in
those
parts
is
intense
,
and
the
hour
*NL*
was
three
in
the
afternoon
,
all
which
made
the
spot
the
more
inviting
and
*NL*
tempted
them
to
wait
there
for
Sancho
's
return
,
which
they
did
.
They
were
*NL*
reposing
,
then
,
in
the
shade
,
when
a
voice
unaccompanied
by
the
notes
of
*NL*
any
instrument
,
but
sweet
and
pleasing
in
its
tone
,
reached
their
ears
,
*NL*
at
which
they
were
not
a
little
astonished
,
as
the
place
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
them
likely
quarters
for
one
who
sang
so
well
;
for
though
it
is
often
*NL*
said
that
shepherds
of
rare
voice
are
to
be
found
in
the
woods
and
*NL*
fields
,
this
is
rather
a
flight
of
the
poet
's
fancy
than
the
truth
.
And
*NL*
still
more
surprised
were
they
when
they
perceived
that
what
they
heard
*NL*
sung
were
the
verses
not
of
rustic
shepherds
,
but
of
the
polished
wits
of
*NL*
the
city
;
and
so
it
proved
,
for
the
verses
they
heard
were
these
:
*NL*
*NL*
What
makes
my
quest
of
happiness
seem
vain
?
*NL*
Disdain
.
*NL*
What
bids
me
to
abandon
hope
of
ease
?
*NL*
Jealousies
.
*NL*
What
holds
my
heart
in
anguish
of
suspense
?
*NL*
Absence
.
*NL*
If
that
be
so
,
then
for
my
grief
*NL*
Where
shall
I
turn
to
seek
relief
,
*NL*
When
hope
on
every
side
lies
slain
*NL*
By
Absence
,
Jealousies
,
Disdain
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
the
prime
cause
of
all
my
woe
doth
prove
?
*NL*
Love
.
*NL*
What
at
my
glory
ever
looks
askance
?
*NL*
Chance
.
*NL*
Whence
is
permission
to
afflict
me
given
?
*NL*
Heaven
.
*NL*
If
that
be
so
,
I
but
await
*NL*
The
stroke
of
a
resistless
fate
,
*NL*
Since
,
working
for
my
woe
,
these
three
,
*NL*
Love
,
Chance
and
Heaven
,
in
league
I
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
must
I
do
to
find
a
remedy
?
*NL*
Die
.
*NL*
What
is
the
lure
for
love
when
coy
and
strange
?
*NL*
Change
.
*NL*
What
,
if
all
fail
,
will
cure
the
heart
of
sadness
?
*NL*
Madness
.
*NL*
If
that
be
so
,
it
is
but
folly
*NL*
To
seek
a
cure
for
melancholy
:
*NL*
Ask
where
it
lies
;
the
answer
saith
*NL*
In
Change
,
in
Madness
,
or
in
Death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
,
the
summer
season
,
the
solitary
place
,
the
voice
and
skill
of
*NL*
the
singer
,
all
contributed
to
the
wonder
and
delight
of
the
two
*NL*
listeners
,
who
remained
still
waiting
to
hear
something
more
;
finding
,
*NL*
however
,
that
the
silence
continued
some
little
time
,
they
resolved
to
go
*NL*
in
search
of
the
musician
who
sang
with
so
fine
a
voice
;
but
just
as
they
*NL*
were
about
to
do
so
they
were
checked
by
the
same
voice
,
which
once
more
*NL*
fell
upon
their
ears
,
singing
this
*NL*
*NL*
SONNET
*NL*
*NL*
When
heavenward
,
holy
Friendship
,
thou
didst
go
*NL*
Soaring
to
seek
thy
home
beyond
the
sky
,
*NL*
And
take
thy
seat
among
the
saints
on
high
,
*NL*
It
was
thy
will
to
leave
on
earth
below
*NL*
Thy
semblance
,
and
upon
it
to
bestow
*NL*
Thy
veil
,
wherewith
at
times
hypocrisy
,
*NL*
Parading
in
thy
shape
,
deceives
the
eye
,
*NL*
And
makes
its
vileness
bright
as
virtue
show
.
*NL*
Friendship
,
return
to
us
,
or
force
the
cheat
*NL*
That
wears
it
now
,
thy
livery
to
restore
,
*NL*
By
aid
whereof
sincerity
is
slain
.
*NL*
If
thou
wilt
not
unmask
thy
counterfeit
,
*NL*
This
earth
will
be
the
prey
of
strife
once
more
,
*NL*
As
when
primaeval
discord
held
its
reign
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
song
ended
with
a
deep
sigh
,
and
again
the
listeners
remained
waiting
*NL*
attentively
for
the
singer
to
resume
;
but
perceiving
that
the
music
had
*NL*
now
turned
to
sobs
and
heart-rending
moans
they
determined
to
find
out
*NL*
who
the
unhappy
being
could
be
whose
voice
was
as
rare
as
his
sighs
were
*NL*
piteous
,
and
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
on
turning
the
corner
of
a
*NL*
rock
they
discovered
a
man
of
the
same
aspect
and
appearance
as
Sancho
*NL*
had
described
to
them
when
he
told
them
the
story
of
Cardenio
.
He
,
*NL*
showing
no
astonishment
when
he
saw
them
,
stood
still
with
his
head
bent
*NL*
down
upon
his
breast
like
one
in
deep
thought
,
without
raising
his
eyes
*NL*
to
look
at
them
after
the
first
glance
when
they
suddenly
came
upon
him
.
*NL*
The
curate
,
who
was
aware
of
his
misfortune
and
recognised
him
by
the
*NL*
description
,
being
a
man
of
good
address
,
approached
him
and
in
a
few
*NL*
sensible
words
entreated
and
urged
him
to
quit
a
life
of
such
misery
,
*NL*
lest
he
should
end
it
there
,
which
would
be
the
greatest
of
all
*NL*
misfortunes
.
Cardenio
was
then
in
his
right
mind
,
free
from
any
attack
of
*NL*
that
madness
which
so
frequently
carried
him
away
,
and
seeing
them
*NL*
dressed
in
a
fashion
so
unusual
among
the
frequenters
of
those
wilds
,
*NL*
could
not
help
showing
some
surprise
,
especially
when
he
heard
them
speak
*NL*
of
his
case
as
if
it
were
a
well-known
matter
-LRB-
for
the
curate
's
words
*NL*
gave
him
to
understand
as
much
-RRB-
so
he
replied
to
them
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
plainly
,
sirs
,
whoever
you
may
be
,
that
Heaven
,
whose
care
it
is
*NL*
to
succour
the
good
,
and
even
the
wicked
very
often
,
here
,
in
this
remote
*NL*
spot
,
cut
off
from
human
intercourse
,
sends
me
,
though
I
deserve
it
not
,
*NL*
those
who
seek
to
draw
me
away
from
this
to
some
better
retreat
,
showing
*NL*
me
by
many
and
forcible
arguments
how
unreasonably
I
act
in
leading
the
*NL*
life
I
do
;
but
as
they
know
,
that
if
I
escape
from
this
evil
I
shall
fall
*NL*
into
another
still
greater
,
perhaps
they
will
set
me
down
as
a
*NL*
weak-minded
man
,
or
,
what
is
worse
,
one
devoid
of
reason
;
nor
would
it
be
*NL*
any
wonder
,
for
I
myself
can
perceive
that
the
effect
of
the
recollection
*NL*
of
my
misfortunes
is
so
great
and
works
so
powerfully
to
my
ruin
,
that
in
*NL*
spite
of
myself
I
become
at
times
like
a
stone
,
without
feeling
or
*NL*
consciousness
;
and
I
come
to
feel
the
truth
of
it
when
they
tell
me
and
*NL*
show
me
proofs
of
the
things
I
have
done
when
the
terrible
fit
*NL*
overmasters
me
;
and
all
I
can
do
is
bewail
my
lot
in
vain
,
and
idly
curse
*NL*
my
destiny
,
and
plead
for
my
madness
by
telling
how
it
was
caused
,
to
any
*NL*
that
care
to
hear
it
;
for
no
reasonable
beings
on
learning
the
cause
will
*NL*
wonder
at
the
effects
;
and
if
they
can
not
help
me
at
least
they
will
not
*NL*
blame
me
,
and
the
repugnance
they
feel
at
my
wild
ways
will
turn
into
*NL*
pity
for
my
woes
.
If
it
be
,
sirs
,
that
you
are
here
with
the
same
design
*NL*
as
others
have
come
wah
,
before
you
proceed
with
your
wise
arguments
,
I
*NL*
entreat
you
to
hear
the
story
of
my
countless
misfortunes
,
for
perhaps
*NL*
when
you
have
heard
it
you
will
spare
yourselves
the
trouble
you
would
*NL*
take
in
offering
consolation
to
grief
that
is
beyond
the
reach
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
,
both
of
them
,
desired
nothing
more
than
to
hear
from
his
own
*NL*
lips
the
cause
of
his
suffering
,
they
entreated
him
to
tell
it
,
promising
*NL*
not
to
do
anything
for
his
relief
or
comfort
that
he
did
not
wish
;
and
*NL*
thereupon
the
unhappy
gentleman
began
his
sad
story
in
nearly
the
same
*NL*
words
and
manner
in
which
he
had
related
it
to
Don
Quixote
and
the
*NL*
goatherd
a
few
days
before
,
when
,
through
Master
Elisabad
,
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
scrupulous
observance
of
what
was
due
to
chivalry
,
the
tale
was
*NL*
left
unfinished
,
as
this
history
has
already
recorded
;
but
now
*NL*
fortunately
the
mad
fit
kept
off
,
allowed
him
to
tell
it
to
the
end
;
and
*NL*
so
,
coming
to
the
incident
of
the
note
which
Don
Fernando
had
found
in
*NL*
the
volume
of
``
Amadis
of
Gaul
,
''
Cardenio
said
that
he
remembered
it
*NL*
perfectly
and
that
it
was
in
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luscinda
to
Cardenio
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
day
I
discover
merits
in
you
that
oblige
and
compel
me
to
hold
you
*NL*
in
higher
estimation
;
so
if
you
desire
to
relieve
me
of
this
obligation
*NL*
without
cost
to
my
honour
,
you
may
easily
do
so
.
I
have
a
father
who
*NL*
knows
you
and
loves
me
dearly
,
who
without
putting
any
constraint
on
my
*NL*
inclination
will
grant
what
will
be
reasonable
for
you
to
have
,
if
it
be
*NL*
that
you
value
me
as
you
say
and
as
I
believe
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
this
letter
I
was
induced
,
as
I
told
you
,
to
demand
Luscinda
for
my
*NL*
wife
,
and
it
was
through
it
that
Luscinda
came
to
be
regarded
by
Don
*NL*
Fernando
as
one
of
the
most
discreet
and
prudent
women
of
the
day
,
and
*NL*
this
letter
it
was
that
suggested
his
design
of
ruining
me
before
mine
*NL*
could
be
carried
into
effect
.
I
told
Don
Fernando
that
all
Luscinda
's
*NL*
father
was
waiting
for
was
that
mine
should
ask
her
of
him
,
which
I
did
*NL*
not
dare
to
suggest
to
him
,
fearing
that
he
would
not
consent
to
do
so
;
*NL*
not
because
he
did
not
know
perfectly
well
the
rank
,
goodness
,
virtue
,
*NL*
and
beauty
of
Luscinda
,
and
that
she
had
qualities
that
would
do
honour
*NL*
to
any
family
in
Spain
,
but
because
I
was
aware
that
he
did
not
wish
me
*NL*
to
marry
so
soon
,
before
seeing
what
the
Duke
Ricardo
would
do
for
me
.
In
*NL*
short
,
I
told
him
I
did
not
venture
to
mention
it
to
my
father
,
as
well
*NL*
on
account
of
that
difficulty
,
as
of
many
others
that
discouraged
me
*NL*
though
I
knew
not
well
what
they
were
,
only
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
*NL*
what
I
desired
was
never
to
come
to
pass
.
To
all
this
Don
Fernando
*NL*
answered
that
he
would
take
it
upon
himself
to
speak
to
my
father
,
and
*NL*
persuade
him
to
speak
to
Luscinda
's
father

O
,
covetous
Judas
!
Traitor
,
cruel
,
vindictive
,
and
*NL*
perfidious
,
wherein
had
this
poor
wretch
failed
in
his
fidelity
,
who
with
*NL*
such
frankness
showed
thee
the
secrets
and
the
joys
of
his
heart
?
What
*NL*
offence
did
I
commit
?
What
words
did
I
utter
,
or
what
counsels
did
I
give
*NL*
that
had
not
the
furtherance
of
thy
honour
and
welfare
for
their
aim
?
*NL*
But
,
woe
is
me
,
wherefore
do
I
complain
?
for
sure
it
is
that
when
*NL*
misfortunes
spring
from
the
stars
,
descending
from
on
high
they
fall
upon
*NL*
us
with
such
fury
and
violence
that
no
power
on
earth
can
check
their
*NL*
course
nor
human
device
stay
their
coming
.
Who
could
have
thought
that
*NL*
Don
Fernando
,
a
highborn
gentleman
,
intelligent
,
bound
to
me
by
gratitude
*NL*
for
my
services
,
one
that
could
win
the
object
of
his
love
wherever
he
*NL*
might
set
his
affections
,
could
have
become
so
obdurate
,
as
they
say
,
as
*NL*
to
rob
me
of
my
one
ewe
lamb
that
was
not
even
yet
in
my
possession
?
But
*NL*
laying
aside
these
useless
and
unavailing
reflections
,
let
us
take
up
the
*NL*
broken
thread
of
my
unhappy
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
proceed
,
then
:
Don
Fernando
finding
my
presence
an
obstacle
to
the
*NL*
execution
of
his
treacherous
and
wicked
design
,
resolved
to
send
me
to
*NL*
his
elder
brother
under
the
pretext
of
asking
money
from
him
to
pay
for
*NL*
six
horses
which
,
purposely
,
and
with
the
sole
object
of
sending
me
away
*NL*
that
he
might
the
better
carry
out
his
infernal
scheme
,
he
had
purchased
*NL*
the
very
day
he
offered
to
speak
to
my
father
,
and
the
price
of
which
he
*NL*
now
desired
me
to
fetch
.
Could
I
have
anticipated
this
treachery
?
Could
I
*NL*
by
any
chance
have
suspected
it
?
Nay
;
so
far
from
that
,
I
offered
with
*NL*
the
greatest
pleasure
to
go
at
once
,
in
my
satisfaction
at
the
good
*NL*
bargain
that
had
been
made
.
That
night
I
spoke
with
Luscinda
,
and
told
*NL*
her
what
had
been
agreed
upon
with
Don
Fernando
,
and
how
I
had
strong
*NL*
hopes
of
our
fair
and
reasonable
wishes
being
realised
.
She
,
as
*NL*
unsuspicious
as
I
was
of
the
treachery
of
Don
Fernando
,
bade
me
try
to
*NL*
return
speedily
,
as
she
believed
the
fulfilment
of
our
desires
would
be
*NL*
delayed
only
so
long
as
my
father
put
off
speaking
to
hers
.
I
know
not
*NL*
why
it
was
that
on
saying
this
to
me
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
,
and
*NL*
there
came
a
lump
in
her
throat
that
prevented
her
from
uttering
a
word
*NL*
of
many
more
that
it
seemed
to
me
she
was
striving
to
say
to
me
.
I
was
*NL*
astonished
at
this
unusual
turn
,
which
I
never
before
observed
in
her
.
*NL*
for
we
always
conversed
,
whenever
good
fortune
and
my
ingenuity
gave
us
*NL*
the
chance
,
with
the
greatest
gaiety
and
cheerfulness
,
mingling
tears
,
*NL*
sighs
,
jealousies
,
doubts
,
or
fears
with
our
words
;
it
was
all
on
my
part
*NL*
a
eulogy
of
my
good
fortune
that
Heaven
should
have
given
her
to
me
for
*NL*
my
mistress
;
I
glorified
her
beauty
,
I
extolled
her
worth
and
her
*NL*
understanding
;
and
she
paid
me
back
by
praising
in
me
what
in
her
love
*NL*
for
me
she
thought
worthy
of
praise
;
and
besides
we
had
a
hundred
*NL*
thousand
trifles
and
doings
of
our
neighbours
and
acquaintances
to
talk
*NL*
about
,
and
the
utmost
extent
of
my
boldness
was
to
take
,
almost
by
force
,
*NL*
one
of
her
fair
white
hands
and
carry
it
to
my
lips
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
closeness
of
the
low
grating
that
separated
us
allowed
me
.
But
the
night
*NL*
before
the
unhappy
day
of
my
departure
she
wept
,
she
moaned
,
she
sighed
,
*NL*
and
she
withdrew
leaving
me
filled
with
perplexity
and
amazement
,
*NL*
overwhelmed
at
the
sight
of
such
strange
and
affecting
signs
of
grief
and
*NL*
sorrow
in
Luscinda
;
but
not
to
dash
my
hopes
I
ascribed
it
all
to
the
*NL*
depth
of
her
love
for
me
and
the
pain
that
separation
gives
those
who
*NL*
love
tenderly
.
At
last
I
took
my
departure
,
sad
and
dejected
,
my
heart
*NL*
filled
with
fancies
and
suspicions
,
but
not
knowing
well
what
it
was
I
*NL*
suspected
or
fancied
;
plain
omens
pointing
to
the
sad
event
and
*NL*
misfortune
that
was
awaiting
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reached
the
place
whither
I
had
been
sent
,
gave
the
letter
to
Don
*NL*
Fernando
's
brother
,
and
was
kindly
received
but
not
promptly
dismissed
,
*NL*
for
he
desired
me
to
wait
,
very
much
against
my
will
,
eight
days
in
some
*NL*
place
where
the
duke
his
father
was
not
likely
to
see
me
,
as
his
brother
*NL*
wrote
that
the
money
was
to
be
sent
without
his
knowledge
;
all
of
which
*NL*
was
a
scheme
of
the
treacherous
Don
Fernando
,
for
his
brother
had
no
want
*NL*
of
money
to
enable
him
to
despatch
me
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
command
was
one
that
exposed
me
to
the
temptation
of
disobeying
it
,
*NL*
as
it
seemed
to
me
impossible
to
endure
life
for
so
many
days
separated
*NL*
from
Luscinda
,
especially
after
leaving
her
in
the
sorrowful
mood
I
have
*NL*
described
to
you
;
nevertheless
as
a
dutiful
servant
I
obeyed
,
though
I
*NL*
felt
it
would
be
at
the
cost
of
my
well-being
.
But
four
days
later
there
*NL*
came
a
man
in
quest
of
me
with
a
letter
which
he
gave
me
,
and
which
by
*NL*
the
address
I
perceived
to
be
from
Luscinda
,
as
the
writing
was
hers
.
I
*NL*
opened
it
with
fear
and
trepidation
,
persuaded
that
it
must
be
something
*NL*
serious
that
had
impelled
her
to
write
to
me
when
at
a
distance
,
as
she
*NL*
seldom
did
so
when
I
was
near
.
Before
reading
it
I
asked
the
man
who
it
*NL*
was
that
had
given
it
to
him
,
and
how
long
he
had
been
upon
the
road
;
he
*NL*
told
me
that
as
he
happened
to
be
passing
through
one
of
the
streets
of
*NL*
the
city
at
the
hour
of
noon
,
a
very
beautiful
lady
called
to
him
from
a
*NL*
window
,
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
said
to
him
hurriedly
,
`
Brother
,
if
*NL*
you
are
,
as
you
seem
to
be
,
a
Christian
,
for
the
love
of
God
I
entreat
*NL*
you
to
have
this
letter
despatched
without
a
moment
's
delay
to
the
place
*NL*
and
person
named
in
the
address
,
all
which
is
well
known
,
and
by
this
you
*NL*
will
render
a
great
service
to
our
Lord
;
and
that
you
may
be
at
no
*NL*
inconvenience
in
doing
so
take
what
is
in
this
handkerchief
;
'
and
said
*NL*
he
,
`
with
this
she
threw
me
a
handkerchief
out
of
the
window
in
which
*NL*
were
tied
up
a
hundred
reals
and
this
gold
ring
which
I
bring
here
*NL*
together
with
the
letter
I
have
given
you
.
And
then
without
waiting
for
*NL*
any
answer
she
left
the
window
,
though
not
before
she
saw
me
take
the
*NL*
letter
and
the
handkerchief
,
and
I
had
by
signs
let
her
know
that
I
would
*NL*
do
as
she
bade
me
;
and
so
,
seeing
myself
so
well
paid
for
the
trouble
I
*NL*
would
have
in
bringing
it
to
you
,
and
knowing
by
the
address
that
it
was
*NL*
to
you
it
was
sent
-LRB-
for
,
senor
,
I
know
you
very
well
-RRB-
,
and
also
unable
to
*NL*
resist
that
beautiful
lady
's
tears
,
I
resolved
to
trust
no
one
else
,
but
*NL*
to
come
myself
and
give
it
to
you
,
and
in
sixteen
hours
from
the
time
*NL*
when
it
was
given
me
I
have
made
the
journey
,
which
,
as
you
know
,
is
*NL*
eighteen
leagues
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
while
the
good-natured
improvised
courier
was
telling
me
this
,
I
*NL*
hung
upon
his
words
,
my
legs
trembling
under
me
so
that
I
could
scarcely
*NL*
stand
.
However
,
I
opened
the
letter
and
read
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
promise
Don
Fernando
gave
you
to
urge
your
father
to
speak
to
mine
,
*NL*
he
has
fulfilled
much
more
to
his
own
satisfaction
than
to
your
*NL*
advantage
.
I
have
to
tell
you
,
senor
,
that
he
has
demanded
me
for
a
wife
,
*NL*
and
my
father
,
led
away
by
what
he
considers
Don
Fernando
's
superiority
*NL*
over
you
,
has
favoured
his
suit
so
cordially
,
that
in
two
days
hence
the
*NL*
betrothal
is
to
take
place
with
such
secrecy
and
so
privately
that
the
*NL*
only
witnesses
are
to
be
the
Heavens
above
and
a
few
of
the
household
.
*NL*
Picture
to
yourself
the
state
I
am
in
;
judge
if
it
be
urgent
for
you
to
*NL*
come
;
the
issue
of
the
affair
will
show
you
whether
I
love
you
or
not
.
*NL*
God
grant
this
may
come
to
your
hand
before
mine
shall
be
forced
to
link
*NL*
itself
with
his
who
keeps
so
ill
the
faith
that
he
has
pledged
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
,
in
brief
,
were
the
words
of
the
letter
,
words
that
made
me
set
out
*NL*
at
once
without
waiting
any
longer
for
reply
or
money
;
for
I
now
saw
*NL*
clearly
that
it
was
not
the
purchase
of
horses
but
of
his
own
pleasure
*NL*
that
had
made
Don
Fernando
send
me
to
his
brother
.
The
exasperation
I
*NL*
felt
against
Don
Fernando
,
joined
with
the
fear
of
losing
the
prize
I
had
*NL*
won
by
so
many
years
of
love
and
devotion
,
lent
me
wings
;
so
that
almost
*NL*
flying
I
reached
home
the
same
day
,
by
the
hour
which
served
for
speaking
*NL*
with
Luscinda
.
I
arrived
unobserved
,
and
left
the
mule
on
which
I
had
*NL*
come
at
the
house
of
the
worthy
man
who
had
brought
me
the
letter
,
and
*NL*
fortune
was
pleased
to
be
for
once
so
kind
that
I
found
Luscinda
at
the
*NL*
grating
that
was
the
witness
of
our
loves
.
She
recognised
me
at
once
,
and
*NL*
I
her
,
but
not
as
she
ought
to
have
recognised
me
,
or
I
her
.
But
who
is
*NL*
there
in
the
world
that
can
boast
of
having
fathomed
or
understood
the
*NL*
wavering
mind
and
unstable
nature
of
a
woman
?
Of
a
truth
no
one
.
To
*NL*
proceed
:
as
soon
as
Luscinda
saw
me
she
said
,
`
Cardenio
,
I
am
in
my
*NL*
bridal
dress
,
and
the
treacherous
Don
Fernando
and
my
covetous
father
are
*NL*
waiting
for
me
in
the
hall
with
the
other
witnesses
,
who
shall
be
the
*NL*
witnesses
of
my
death
before
they
witness
my
betrothal
.
Be
not
*NL*
distressed
,
my
friend
,
but
contrive
to
be
present
at
this
sacrifice
,
and
*NL*
if
that
can
not
be
prevented
by
my
words
,
I
have
a
dagger
concealed
which
*NL*
will
prevent
more
deliberate
violence
,
putting
an
end
to
my
life
and
*NL*
giving
thee
a
first
proof
of
the
love
I
have
borne
and
bear
thee
.
'
I
*NL*
replied
to
her
distractedly
and
hastily
,
in
fear
lest
I
should
not
have
*NL*
time
to
reply
,
`
May
thy
words
be
verified
by
thy
deeds
,
lady
;
and
if
thou
*NL*
hast
a
dagger
to
save
thy
honour
,
I
have
a
sword
to
defend
thee
or
kill
*NL*
myself
if
fortune
be
against
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
could
not
have
heard
all
these
words
,
for
I
perceived
that
*NL*
they
called
her
away
in
haste
,
as
the
bridegroom
was
waiting
.
Now
the
*NL*
night
of
my
sorrow
set
in
,
the
sun
of
my
happiness
went
down
,
I
felt
my
*NL*
eyes
bereft
of
sight
,
my
mind
of
reason
.
I
could
not
enter
the
house
,
nor
*NL*
was
I
capable
of
any
movement
;
but
reflecting
how
important
it
was
that
I
*NL*
should
be
present
at
what
might
take
place
on
the
occasion
,
I
nerved
*NL*
myself
as
best
I
could
and
went
in
,
for
I
well
knew
all
the
entrances
and
*NL*
outlets
;
and
besides
,
with
the
confusion
that
in
secret
pervaded
the
*NL*
house
no
one
took
notice
of
me
,
so
,
without
being
seen
,
I
found
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
placing
myself
in
the
recess
formed
by
a
window
of
the
*NL*
hall
itself
,
and
concealed
by
the
ends
and
borders
of
two
tapestries
,
*NL*
from
between
which
I
could
,
without
being
seen
,
see
all
that
took
place
*NL*
in
the
room
.
Who
could
describe
the
agitation
of
heart
I
suffered
as
I
*NL*
stood
there
--
the
thoughts
that
came
to
me
--
the
reflections
that
passed
*NL*
through
my
mind
?
They
were
such
as
can
not
be
,
nor
were
it
well
they
*NL*
should
be
,
told
.
Suffice
it
to
say
that
the
bridegroom
entered
the
hall
*NL*
in
his
usual
dress
,
without
ornament
of
any
kind
;
as
groomsman
he
had
*NL*
with
him
a
cousin
of
Luscinda
's
and
except
the
servants
of
the
house
*NL*
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
chamber
.
Soon
afterwards
Luscinda
came
out
*NL*
from
an
antechamber
,
attended
by
her
mother
and
two
of
her
damsels
,
*NL*
arrayed
and
adorned
as
became
her
rank
and
beauty
,
and
in
full
festival
*NL*
and
ceremonial
attire
.
My
anxiety
and
distraction
did
not
allow
me
to
*NL*
observe
or
notice
particularly
what
she
wore
;
I
could
only
perceive
the
*NL*
colours
,
which
were
crimson
and
white
,
and
the
glitter
of
the
gems
and
*NL*
jewels
on
her
head
dress
and
apparel
,
surpassed
by
the
rare
beauty
of
her
*NL*
lovely
auburn
hair
that
vying
with
the
precious
stones
and
the
light
of
*NL*
the
four
torches
that
stood
in
the
hall
shone
with
a
brighter
gleam
than
*NL*
all
.
Oh
memory
,
mortal
foe
of
my
peace
!
why
bring
before
me
now
the
*NL*
incomparable
beauty
of
that
adored
enemy
of
mine
?
Were
it
not
better
,
*NL*
cruel
memory
,
to
remind
me
and
recall
what
she
then
did
,
that
stirred
by
*NL*
a
wrong
so
glaring
I
may
seek
,
if
not
vengeance
now
,
at
least
to
rid
*NL*
myself
of
life
?
Be
not
weary
,
sirs
,
of
listening
to
these
digressions
;
my
*NL*
sorrow
is
not
one
of
those
that
can
or
should
be
told
tersely
and
*NL*
briefly
,
for
to
me
each
incident
seems
to
call
for
many
words
.

*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
curate
replied
that
not
only
were
they
not
weary
of
listening
*NL*
to
him
,
but
that
the
details
he
mentioned
interested
them
greatly
,
being
*NL*
of
a
kind
by
no
means
to
be
omitted
and
deserving
of
the
same
attention
*NL*
as
the
main
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
proceed
,
then
,
''
continued
Cardenio
:
``
all
being
assembled
in
the
hall
,
*NL*
the
priest
of
the
parish
came
in
and
as
he
took
the
pair
by
the
hand
to
*NL*
perform
the
requisite
ceremony
,
at
the
words
,
`
Will
you
,
Senora
Luscinda
,
*NL*
take
Senor
Don
Fernando
,
here
present
,
for
your
lawful
husband
,
as
the
*NL*
holy
Mother
Church
ordains
?
'
I
thrust
my
head
and
neck
out
from
between
*NL*
the
tapestries
,
and
with
eager
ears
and
throbbing
heart
set
myself
to
*NL*
listen
to
Luscinda
's
answer
,
awaiting
in
her
reply
the
sentence
of
death
*NL*
or
the
grant
of
life
.
Oh
,
that
I
had
but
dared
at
that
moment
to
rush
*NL*
forward
crying
aloud
,
`
Luscinda
,
Luscinda
!
have
a
care
what
thou
dost
;
*NL*
remember
what
thou
owest
me
;
bethink
thee
thou
art
mine
and
canst
not
be
*NL*
another
's
;
reflect
that
thy
utterance
of
``
Yes
''
and
the
end
of
my
life
*NL*
will
come
at
the
same
instant
.
O
,
treacherous
Don
Fernando
!
robber
of
my
*NL*
glory
,
death
of
my
life
!
What
seekest
thou
?
Remember
that
thou
canst
not
*NL*
as
a
Christian
attain
the
object
of
thy
wishes
,
for
Luscinda
is
my
bride
,
*NL*
and
I
am
her
husband
!
'
Fool
that
I
am
!
now
that
I
am
far
away
,
and
out
of
*NL*
danger
,
I
say
I
should
have
done
what
I
did
not
do
:
now
that
I
have
*NL*
allowed
my
precious
treasure
to
be
robbed
from
me
,
I
curse
the
robber
,
on
*NL*
whom
I
might
have
taken
vengeance
had
I
as
much
heart
for
it
as
I
have
*NL*
for
bewailing
my
fate
;
in
short
,
as
I
was
then
a
coward
and
a
fool
,
*NL*
little
wonder
is
it
if
I
am
now
dying
shame-stricken
,
remorseful
,
and
*NL*
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
priest
stood
waiting
for
the
answer
of
Luscinda
,
who
for
a
long
time
*NL*
withheld
it
;
and
just
as
I
thought
she
was
taking
out
the
dagger
to
save
*NL*
her
honour
,
or
struggling
for
words
to
make
some
declaration
of
the
truth
*NL*
on
my
behalf
,
I
heard
her
say
in
a
faint
and
feeble
voice
,
'
I
will
:
'
Don
*NL*
Fernando
said
the
same
,
and
giving
her
the
ring
they
stood
linked
by
a
*NL*
knot
that
could
never
be
loosed
.
The
bridegroom
then
approached
to
*NL*
embrace
his
bride
;
and
she
,
pressing
her
hand
upon
her
heart
,
fell
*NL*
fainting
in
her
mother
's
arms
.
It
only
remains
now
for
me
to
tell
you
the
*NL*
state
I
was
in
when
in
that
consent
that
I
heard
I
saw
all
my
hopes
*NL*
mocked
,
the
words
and
promises
of
Luscinda
proved
falsehoods
,
and
the
*NL*
recovery
of
the
prize
I
had
that
instant
lost
rendered
impossible
for
*NL*
ever
.
I
stood
stupefied
,
wholly
abandoned
,
it
seemed
,
by
Heaven
,
declared
*NL*
the
enemy
of
the
earth
that
bore
me
,
the
air
refusing
me
breath
for
my
*NL*
sighs
,
the
water
moisture
for
my
tears
;
it
was
only
the
fire
that
*NL*
gathered
strength
so
that
my
whole
frame
glowed
with
rage
and
jealousy
.
*NL*
They
were
all
thrown
into
confusion
by
Luscinda
's
fainting
,
and
as
her
*NL*
mother
was
unlacing
her
to
give
her
air
a
sealed
paper
was
discovered
in
*NL*
her
bosom
which
Don
Fernando
seized
at
once
and
began
to
read
by
the
*NL*
light
of
one
of
the
torches
.
As
soon
as
he
had
read
it
he
seated
himself
*NL*
in
a
chair
,
leaning
his
cheek
on
his
hand
in
the
attitude
of
one
deep
in
*NL*
thought
,
without
taking
any
part
in
the
efforts
that
were
being
made
to
*NL*
recover
his
bride
from
her
fainting
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seeing
all
the
household
in
confusion
,
I
ventured
to
come
out
regardless
*NL*
whether
I
were
seen
or
not
,
and
determined
,
if
I
were
,
to
do
some
*NL*
frenzied
deed
that
would
prove
to
all
the
world
the
righteous
indignation
*NL*
of
my
breast
in
the
punishment
of
the
treacherous
Don
Fernando
,
and
even
*NL*
in
that
of
the
fickle
fainting
traitress
.
But
my
fate
,
doubtless
*NL*
reserving
me
for
greater
sorrows
,
if
such
there
be
,
so
ordered
it
that
*NL*
just
then
I
had
enough
and
to
spare
of
that
reason
which
has
since
been
*NL*
wanting
to
me
;
and
so
,
without
seeking
to
take
vengeance
on
my
greatest
*NL*
enemies
-LRB-
which
might
have
been
easily
taken
,
as
all
thought
of
me
was
so
*NL*
far
from
their
minds
-RRB-
,
I
resolved
to
take
it
upon
myself
,
and
on
myself
*NL*
to
inflict
the
pain
they
deserved
,
perhaps
with
even
greater
severity
*NL*
than
I
should
have
dealt
out
to
them
had
I
then
slain
them
;
for
sudden
*NL*
pain
is
soon
over
,
but
that
which
is
protracted
by
tortures
is
ever
*NL*
slaying
without
ending
life
.
In
a
word
,
I
quitted
the
house
and
reached
*NL*
that
of
the
man
with
whom
I
had
left
my
mule
;
I
made
him
saddle
it
for
*NL*
me
,
mounted
without
bidding
him
farewell
,
and
rode
out
of
the
city
,
like
*NL*
another
Lot
,
not
daring
to
turn
my
head
to
look
back
upon
it
;
and
when
I
*NL*
found
myself
alone
in
the
open
country
,
screened
by
the
darkness
of
the
*NL*
night
,
and
tempted
by
the
stillness
to
give
vent
to
my
grief
without
*NL*
apprehension
or
fear
of
being
heard
or
seen
,
then
I
broke
silence
and
*NL*
lifted
up
my
voice
in
maledictions
upon
Luscinda
and
Don
Fernando
,
as
if
*NL*
I
could
thus
avenge
the
wrong
they
had
done
me
.
I
called
her
cruel
,
*NL*
ungrateful
,
false
,
thankless
,
but
above
all
covetous
,
since
the
wealth
of
*NL*
my
enemy
had
blinded
the
eyes
of
her
affection
,
and
turned
it
from
me
to
*NL*
transfer
it
to
one
to
whom
fortune
had
been
more
generous
and
liberal
.
*NL*
And
yet
,
in
the
midst
of
this
outburst
of
execration
and
upbraiding
,
I
*NL*
found
excuses
for
her
,
saying
it
was
no
wonder
that
a
young
girl
in
the
*NL*
seclusion
of
her
parents
'
house
,
trained
and
schooled
to
obey
them
*NL*
always
,
should
have
been
ready
to
yield
to
their
wishes
when
they
offered
*NL*
her
for
a
husband
a
gentleman
of
such
distinction
,
wealth
,
and
noble
*NL*
birth
,
that
if
she
had
refused
to
accept
him
she
would
have
been
thought
*NL*
out
of
her
senses
,
or
to
have
set
her
affection
elsewhere
,
a
suspicion
*NL*
injurious
to
her
fair
name
and
fame
.
But
then
again
,
I
said
,
had
she
*NL*
declared
I
was
her
husband
,
they
would
have
seen
that
in
choosing
me
she
*NL*
had
not
chosen
so
ill
but
that
they
might
excuse
her
,
for
before
Don
*NL*
Fernando
had
made
his
offer
,
they
themselves
could
not
have
desired
,
if
*NL*
their
desires
had
been
ruled
by
reason
,
a
more
eligible
husband
for
their
*NL*
daughter
than
I
was
;
and
she
,
before
taking
the
last
fatal
step
of
giving
*NL*
her
hand
,
might
easily
have
said
that
I
had
already
given
her
mine
,
for
I
*NL*
should
have
come
forward
to
support
any
assertion
of
hers
to
that
effect
.
*NL*
In
short
,
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
feeble
love
,
little
reflection
,
*NL*
great
ambition
,
and
a
craving
for
rank
,
had
made
her
forget
the
words
*NL*
with
which
she
had
deceived
me
,
encouraged
and
supported
by
my
firm
hopes
*NL*
and
honourable
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
soliloquising
and
agitated
,
I
journeyed
onward
for
the
remainder
of
*NL*
the
night
,
and
by
daybreak
I
reached
one
of
the
passes
of
these
*NL*
mountains
,
among
which
I
wandered
for
three
days
more
without
taking
any
*NL*
path
or
road
,
until
I
came
to
some
meadows
lying
on
I
know
not
which
side
*NL*
of
the
mountains
,
and
there
I
inquired
of
some
herdsmen
in
what
direction
*NL*
the
most
rugged
part
of
the
range
lay
.
They
told
me
that
it
was
in
this
*NL*
quarter
,
and
I
at
once
directed
my
course
hither
,
intending
to
end
my
*NL*
life
here
;
but
as
I
was
making
my
way
among
these
crags
,
my
mule
dropped
*NL*
dead
through
fatigue
and
hunger
,
or
,
as
I
think
more
likely
,
in
order
to
*NL*
have
done
with
such
a
worthless
burden
as
it
bore
in
me
.
I
was
left
on
*NL*
foot
,
worn
out
,
famishing
,
without
anyone
to
help
me
or
any
thought
of
*NL*
seeking
help
:
and
so
thus
I
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
,
how
long
I
know
*NL*
not
,
after
which
I
rose
up
free
from
hunger
,
and
found
beside
me
some
*NL*
goatherds
,
who
no
doubt
were
the
persons
who
had
relieved
me
in
my
need
,
*NL*
for
they
told
me
how
they
had
found
me
,
and
how
I
had
been
uttering
*NL*
ravings
that
showed
plainly
I
had
lost
my
reason
;
and
since
then
I
am
*NL*
conscious
that
I
am
not
always
in
full
possession
of
it
,
but
at
times
so
*NL*
deranged
and
crazed
that
I
do
a
thousand
mad
things
,
tearing
my
clothes
,
*NL*
crying
aloud
in
these
solitudes
,
cursing
my
fate
,
and
idly
calling
on
the
*NL*
dear
name
of
her
who
is
my
enemy
,
and
only
seeking
to
end
my
life
in
*NL*
lamentation
;
and
when
I
recover
my
senses
I
find
myself
so
exhausted
and
*NL*
weary
that
I
can
scarcely
move
.
Most
commonly
my
dwelling
is
the
hollow
*NL*
of
a
cork
tree
large
enough
to
shelter
this
miserable
body
;
the
herdsmen
*NL*
and
goatherds
who
frequent
these
mountains
,
moved
by
compassion
,
furnish
*NL*
me
with
food
,
leaving
it
by
the
wayside
or
on
the
rocks
,
where
they
think
*NL*
I
may
perhaps
pass
and
find
it
;
and
so
,
even
though
I
may
be
then
out
of
*NL*
my
senses
,
the
wants
of
nature
teach
me
what
is
required
to
sustain
me
,
*NL*
and
make
me
crave
it
and
eager
to
take
it
.
At
other
times
,
so
they
tell
*NL*
me
when
they
find
me
in
a
rational
mood
,
I
sally
out
upon
the
road
,
and
*NL*
though
they
would
gladly
give
it
me
,
I
snatch
food
by
force
from
the
*NL*
shepherds
bringing
it
from
the
village
to
their
huts
.
Thus
do
pass
the
*NL*
wretched
life
that
remains
to
me
,
until
it
be
Heaven
's
will
to
bring
it
*NL*
to
a
close
,
or
so
to
order
my
memory
that
I
no
longer
recollect
the
*NL*
beauty
and
treachery
of
Luscinda
,
or
the
wrong
done
me
by
Don
Fernando
;
*NL*
for
if
it
will
do
this
without
depriving
me
of
life
,
I
will
turn
my
*NL*
thoughts
into
some
better
channel
;
if
not
,
I
can
only
implore
it
to
have
*NL*
full
mercy
on
my
soul
,
for
in
myself
I
feel
no
power
or
strength
to
*NL*
release
my
body
from
this
strait
in
which
I
have
of
my
own
accord
chosen
*NL*
to
place
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
,
sirs
,
is
the
dismal
story
of
my
misfortune
:
say
if
it
be
one
that
*NL*
can
be
told
with
less
emotion
than
you
have
seen
in
me
;
and
do
not
*NL*
trouble
yourselves
with
urging
or
pressing
upon
me
what
reason
suggests
*NL*
as
likely
to
serve
for
my
relief
,
for
it
will
avail
me
as
much
as
the
*NL*
medicine
prescribed
by
a
wise
physician
avails
the
sick
man
who
will
not
*NL*
take
it
.
I
have
no
wish
for
health
without
Luscinda
;
and
since
it
is
her
*NL*
pleasure
to
be
another
's
,
when
she
is
or
should
be
mine
,
let
it
be
mine
*NL*
to
be
a
prey
to
misery
when
I
might
have
enjoyed
happiness
.
She
by
her
*NL*
fickleness
strove
to
make
my
ruin
irretrievable
;
I
will
strive
to
gratify
*NL*
her
wishes
by
seeking
destruction
;
and
it
will
show
generations
to
come
*NL*
that
I
alone
was
deprived
of
that
of
which
all
others
in
misfortune
have
*NL*
a
superabundance
,
for
to
them
the
impossibility
of
being
consoled
is
*NL*
itself
a
consolation
,
while
to
me
it
is
the
cause
of
greater
sorrows
and
*NL*
sufferings
,
for
I
think
that
even
in
death
there
will
not
be
an
end
of
*NL*
them
.

he
was
stopped

the
charm
of
his
veracious
history
,
but
also
of
*NL*
the
tales
and
episodes
contained
in
it
which
are
,
in
a
measure
,
no
less
*NL*
pleasing
,
ingenious
,
and
truthful
,
than
the
history
itself
;
which
,
*NL*
resuming
its
thread
,
carded
,
spun
,
and
wound
,
relates
that
just
as
the
*NL*
curate
was
going
to
offer
consolation
to
Cardenio
,
he
was
interrupted
by
*NL*
a
voice
that
fell
upon
his
ear
saying
in
plaintive
tones
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
!
is
it
possible
I
have
found
a
place
that
may
serve
as
a
secret
*NL*
grave
for
the
weary
load
of
this
body
that
I
support
so
unwillingly
?
If
*NL*
the
solitude
these
mountains
promise
deceives
me
not
,
it
is
so
;
ah
!
woe
*NL*
is
me
!
how
much
more
grateful
to
my
mind
will
be
the
society
of
these
*NL*
rocks
and
brakes
that
permit
me
to
complain
of
my
misfortune
to
Heaven
,
*NL*
than
that
of
any
human
being
,
for
there
is
none
on
earth
to
look
to
for
*NL*
counsel
in
doubt
,
comfort
in
sorrow
,
or
relief
in
distress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
heard
distinctly
by
the
curate
and
those
with
him
,
and
as
it
*NL*
seemed
to
them
to
be
uttered
close
by
,
as
indeed
it
was
,
they
got
up
to
*NL*
look
for
the
speaker
,
and
before
they
had
gone
twenty
paces
they
*NL*
discovered
behind
a
rock
,
seated
at
the
foot
of
an
ash
tree
,
a
youth
in
*NL*
the
dress
of
a
peasant
,
whose
face
they
were
unable
at
the
moment
to
see
*NL*
as
he
was
leaning
forward
,
bathing
his
feet
in
the
brook
that
flowed
*NL*
past
.
They
approached
so
silently
that
he
did
not
perceive
them
,
being
*NL*
fully
occupied
in
bathing
his
feet
,
which
were
so
fair
that
they
looked
*NL*
like
two
pieces
of
shining
crystal
brought
forth
among
the
other
stones
*NL*
of
the
brook
.
The
whiteness
and
beauty
of
these
feet
struck
them
with
*NL*
surprise
,
for
they
did
not
seem
to
have
been
made
to
crush
clods
or
to
*NL*
follow
the
plough
and
the
oxen
as
their
owner
's
dress
suggested
;
and
so
,
*NL*
finding
they
had
not
been
noticed
,
the
curate
,
who
was
in
front
,
made
a
*NL*
sign
to
the
other
two
to
conceal
themselves
behind
some
fragments
of
rock
*NL*
that
lay
there
;
which
they
did
,
observing
closely
what
the
youth
was
*NL*
about
.
He
had
on
a
loose
double-skirted
dark
brown
jacket
bound
tight
to
*NL*
his
body
with
a
white
cloth
;
he
wore
besides
breeches
and
gaiters
of
*NL*
brown
cloth
,
and
on
his
head
a
brown
montera
;
and
he
had
the
gaiters
*NL*
turned
up
as
far
as
the
middle
of
the
leg
,
which
verily
seemed
to
be
of
*NL*
pure
alabaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
had
done
bathing
his
beautiful
feet
,
he
wiped
them
with
a
*NL*
towel
he
took
from
under
the
montera
,
on
taking
off
which
he
raised
his
*NL*
face
,
and
those
who
were
watching
him
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
a
*NL*
beauty
so
exquisite
that
Cardenio
said
to
the
curate
in
a
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
this
is
not
Luscinda
,
it
is
no
human
creature
but
a
divine
being
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
then
took
off
the
montera
,
and
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
*NL*
side
there
broke
loose
and
spread
out
a
mass
of
hair
that
the
beams
of
*NL*
the
sun
might
have
envied
;
by
this
they
knew
that
what
had
seemed
a
*NL*
peasant
was
a
lovely
woman
,
nay
the
most
beautiful
the
eyes
of
two
of
*NL*
them
had
ever
beheld
,
or
even
Cardenio
's
if
they
had
not
seen
and
known
*NL*
Luscinda
,
for
he
afterwards
declared
that
only
the
beauty
of
Luscinda
*NL*
could
compare
with
this
.
The
long
auburn
tresses
not
only
covered
her
*NL*
shoulders
,
but
such
was
their
length
and
abundance
,
concealed
her
all
*NL*
round
beneath
their
masses
,
so
that
except
the
feet
nothing
of
her
form
*NL*
was
visible
.
She
now
used
her
hands
as
a
comb
,
and
if
her
feet
had
seemed
*NL*
like
bits
of
crystal
in
the
water
,
her
hands
looked
like
pieces
of
driven
*NL*
snow
among
her
locks
;
all
which
increased
not
only
the
admiration
of
the
*NL*
three
beholders
,
but
their
anxiety
to
learn
who
she
was
.
With
this
object
*NL*
they
resolved
to
show
themselves
,
and
at
the
stir
they
made
in
getting
*NL*
upon
their
feet
the
fair
damsel
raised
her
head
,
and
parting
her
hair
*NL*
from
before
her
eyes
with
both
hands
,
she
looked
to
see
who
had
made
the
*NL*
noise
,
and
the
instant
she
perceived
them
she
started
to
her
feet
,
and
*NL*
without
waiting
to
put
on
her
shoes
or
gather
up
her
hair
,
hastily
*NL*
snatched
up
a
bundle
as
though
of
clothes
that
she
had
beside
her
,
and
,
*NL*
scared
and
alarmed
,
endeavoured
to
take
flight
;
but
before
she
had
gone
*NL*
six
paces
she
fell
to
the
ground
,
her
delicate
feet
being
unable
to
bear
*NL*
the
roughness
of
the
stones
;
seeing
which
,
the
three
hastened
towards
*NL*
her
,
and
the
curate
addressing
her
first
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
senora
,
whoever
you
may
be
,
for
those
whom
you
see
here
only
*NL*
desire
to
be
of
service
to
you
;
you
have
no
need
to
attempt
a
flight
so
*NL*
heedless
,
for
neither
can
your
feet
bear
it
,
nor
we
allow
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Taken
by
surprise
and
bewildered
,
she
made
no
reply
to
these
words
.
They
,
*NL*
however
,
came
towards
her
,
and
the
curate
taking
her
hand
went
on
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
your
dress
would
hide
,
senora
,
is
made
known
to
us
by
your
hair
;
a
*NL*
clear
proof
that
it
can
be
no
trifling
cause
that
has
disguised
your
*NL*
beauty
in
a
garb
so
unworthy
of
it
,
and
sent
it
into
solitudes
like
these
*NL*
where
we
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
you
,
if
not
to
relieve
your
*NL*
distress
,
at
least
to
offer
you
comfort
;
for
no
distress
,
so
long
as
life
*NL*
lasts
,
can
be
so
oppressive
or
reach
such
a
height
as
to
make
the
*NL*
sufferer
refuse
to
listen
to
comfort
offered
with
good
intention
.
And
so
,
*NL*
senora
,
or
senor
,
or
whatever
you
prefer
to
be
,
dismiss
the
fears
that
*NL*
our
appearance
has
caused
you
and
make
us
acquainted
with
your
good
or
*NL*
evil
fortunes
,
for
from
all
of
us
together
,
or
from
each
one
of
us
,
you
*NL*
will
receive
sympathy
in
your
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
curate
was
speaking
,
the
disguised
damsel
stood
as
if
*NL*
spell-bound
,
looking
at
them
without
opening
her
lips
or
uttering
a
word
,
*NL*
just
like
a
village
rustic
to
whom
something
strange
that
he
has
never
*NL*
seen
before
has
been
suddenly
shown
;
but
on
the
curate
addressing
some
*NL*
further
words
to
the
same
effect
to
her
,
sighing
deeply
she
broke
silence
*NL*
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
the
solitude
of
these
mountains
has
been
unable
to
conceal
me
,
and
*NL*
the
escape
of
my
dishevelled
tresses
will
not
allow
my
tongue
to
deal
in
*NL*
falsehoods
,
it
would
be
idle
for
me
now
to
make
any
further
pretence
of
*NL*
what
,
if
you
were
to
believe
me
,
you
would
believe
more
out
of
courtesy
*NL*
than
for
any
other
reason
.
This
being
so
,
I
say
I
thank
you
,
sirs
,
for
*NL*
the
offer
you
have
made
me
,
which
places
me
under
the
obligation
of
*NL*
complying
with
the
request
you
have
made
of
me
;
though
I
fear
the
account
*NL*
I
shall
give
you
of
my
misfortunes
will
excite
in
you
as
much
concern
as
*NL*
compassion
,
for
you
will
be
unable
to
suggest
anything
to
remedy
them
or
*NL*
any
consolation
to
alleviate
them
.
However
,
that
my
honour
may
not
be
*NL*
left
a
matter
of
doubt
in
your
minds
,
now
that
you
have
discovered
me
to
*NL*
be
a
woman
,
and
see
that
I
am
young
,
alone
,
and
in
this
dress
,
things
*NL*
that
taken
together
or
separately
would
be
enough
to
destroy
any
good
*NL*
name
,
I
feel
bound
to
tell
what
I
would
willingly
keep
secret
if
I
*NL*
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
she
who
was
now
seen
to
be
a
lovely
woman
delivered
without
any
*NL*
hesitation
,
with
so
much
ease
and
in
so
sweet
a
voice
that
they
were
not
*NL*
less
charmed
by
her
intelligence
than
by
her
beauty
,
and
as
they
again
*NL*
repeated
their
offers
and
entreaties
to
her
to
fulfil
her
promise
,
she
*NL*
without
further
pressing
,
first
modestly
covering
her
feet
and
gathering
*NL*
up
her
hair
,
seated
herself
on
a
stone
with
the
three
placed
around
her
,
*NL*
and
,
after
an
effort
to
restrain
some
tears
that
came
to
her
eyes
,
in
a
*NL*
clear
and
steady
voice
began
her
story
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
Andalusia
there
is
a
town
from
which
a
duke
takes
a
title
which
*NL*
makes
him
one
of
those
that
are
called
Grandees
of
Spain
.
This
nobleman
*NL*
has
two
sons
,
the
elder
heir
to
his
dignity
and
apparently
to
his
good
*NL*
qualities
;
the
younger
heir
to
I
know
not
what
,
unless
it
be
the
*NL*
treachery
of
Vellido
and
the
falsehood
of
Ganelon
.
My
parents
are
this
*NL*
lord
's
vassals
,
lowly
in
origin
,
but
so
wealthy
that
if
birth
had
*NL*
conferred
as
much
on
them
as
fortune
,
they
would
have
had
nothing
left
to
*NL*
desire
,
nor
should
I
have
had
reason
to
fear
trouble
like
that
in
which
I
*NL*
find
myself
now
;
for
it
may
be
that
my
ill
fortune
came
of
theirs
in
not
*NL*
having
been
nobly
born
.
It
is
true
they
are
not
so
low
that
they
have
any
*NL*
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
their
condition
,
but
neither
are
they
so
high
as
*NL*
to
remove
from
my
mind
the
impression
that
my
mishap
comes
of
their
*NL*
humble
birth
.
They
are
,
in
short
,
peasants
,
plain
homely
people
,
without
*NL*
any
taint
of
disreputable
blood
,
and
,
as
the
saying
is
,
old
rusty
*NL*
Christians
,
but
so
rich
that
by
their
wealth
and
free-handed
way
of
life
*NL*
they
are
coming
by
degrees
to
be
considered
gentlefolk
by
birth
,
and
even
*NL*
by
position
;
though
the
wealth
and
nobility
they
thought
most
of
was
*NL*
having
me
for
their
daughter
;
and
as
they
have
no
other
child
to
make
*NL*
their
heir
,
and
are
affectionate
parents
,
I
was
one
of
the
most
indulged
*NL*
daughters
that
ever
parents
indulged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
the
mirror
in
which
they
beheld
themselves
,
the
staff
of
their
old
*NL*
age
,
and
the
object
in
which
,
with
submission
to
Heaven
,
all
their
wishes
*NL*
centred
,
and
mine
were
in
accordance
with
theirs
,
for
I
knew
their
worth
;
*NL*
and
as
I
was
mistress
of
their
hearts
,
so
was
I
also
of
their
*NL*
possessions
.
Through
me
they
engaged
or
dismissed
their
servants
;
through
*NL*
my
hands
passed
the
accounts
and
returns
of
what
was
sown
and
reaped
;
the
*NL*
oil-mills
,
the
wine-presses
,
the
count
of
the
flocks
and
herds
,
the
*NL*
beehives
,
all
in
short
that
a
rich
farmer
like
my
father
has
or
can
have
,
*NL*
I
had
under
my
care
,
and
I
acted
as
steward
and
mistress
with
an
*NL*
assiduity
on
my
part
and
satisfaction
on
theirs
that
I
can
not
well
*NL*
describe
to
you
.
The
leisure
hours
left
to
me
after
I
had
given
the
*NL*
requisite
orders
to
the
head-shepherds
,
overseers
,
and
other
labourers
,
I
*NL*
passed
in
such
employments
as
are
not
only
allowable
but
necessary
for
*NL*
young
girls
,
those
that
the
needle
,
embroidery
cushion
,
and
spinning
*NL*
wheel
usually
afford
,
and
if
to
refresh
my
mind
I
quitted
them
for
a
*NL*
while
,
I
found
recreation
in
reading
some
devotional
book
or
playing
the
*NL*
harp
,
for
experience
taught
me
that
music
soothes
the
troubled
mind
and
*NL*
relieves
weariness
of
spirit
.
Such
was
the
life
I
led
in
my
parents
'
*NL*
house
and
if
I
have
depicted
it
thus
minutely
,
it
is
not
out
of
*NL*
ostentation
,
or
to
let
you
know
that
I
am
rich
,
but
that
you
may
see
how
,
*NL*
without
any
fault
of
mine
,
I
have
fallen
from
the
happy
condition
I
have
*NL*
described
,
to
the
misery
I
am
in
at
present
.
The
truth
is
,
that
while
I
*NL*
was
leading
this
busy
life
,
in
a
retirement
that
might
compare
with
that
*NL*
of
a
monastery
,
and
unseen
as
I
thought
by
any
except
the
servants
of
the
*NL*
house
-LRB-
for
when
I
went
to
Mass
it
was
so
early
in
the
morning
,
and
I
was
*NL*
so
closely
attended
by
my
mother
and
the
women
of
the
household
,
and
so
*NL*
thickly
veiled
and
so
shy
,
that
my
eyes
scarcely
saw
more
ground
than
I
*NL*
trod
on
-RRB-
,
in
spite
of
all
this
,
the
eyes
of
love
,
or
idleness
,
more
*NL*
properly
speaking
,
that
the
lynx
's
can
not
rival
,
discovered
me
,
with
the
*NL*
help
of
the
assiduity
of
Don
Fernando
;
for
that
is
the
name
of
the
*NL*
younger
son
of
the
duke
I
told
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
the
speaker
mentioned
the
name
of
Don
Fernando
,
Cardenio
*NL*
changed
colour
and
broke
into
a
sweat
,
with
such
signs
of
emotion
that
*NL*
the
curate
and
the
barber
,
who
observed
it
,
feared
that
one
of
the
mad
*NL*
fits
which
they
heard
attacked
him
sometimes
was
coming
upon
him
;
but
*NL*
Cardenio
showed
no
further
agitation
and
remained
quiet
,
regarding
the
*NL*
peasant
girl
with
fixed
attention
,
for
he
began
to
suspect
who
she
was
.
*NL*
She
,
however
,
without
noticing
the
excitement
of
Cardenio
,
continuing
her
*NL*
story
,
went
on
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
had
hardly
discovered
me
,
when
,
as
he
owned
afterwards
,
he
was
*NL*
smitten
with
a
violent
love
for
me
,
as
the
manner
in
which
it
displayed
*NL*
itself
plainly
showed
.
But
to
shorten
the
long
recital
of
my
woes
,
I
will
*NL*
pass
over
in
silence
all
the
artifices
employed
by
Don
Fernando
for
*NL*
declaring
his
passion
for
me
.
He
bribed
all
the
household
,
he
gave
and
*NL*
offered
gifts
and
presents
to
my
parents
;
every
day
was
like
a
holiday
or
*NL*
a
merry-making
in
our
street
;
by
night
no
one
could
sleep
for
the
music
;
*NL*
the
love
letters
that
used
to
come
to
my
hand
,
no
one
knew
how
,
were
*NL*
innumerable
,
full
of
tender
pleadings
and
pledges
,
containing
more
*NL*
promises
and
oaths
than
there
were
letters
in
them
;
all
which
not
only
*NL*
did
not
soften
me
,
but
hardened
my
heart
against
him
,
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
my
mortal
enemy
,
and
as
if
everything
he
did
to
make
me
yield
were
done
*NL*
with
the
opposite
intention
.
Not
that
the
high-bred
bearing
of
Don
*NL*
Fernando
was
disagreeable
to
me
,
or
that
I
found
his
importunities
*NL*
wearisome
;
for
it
gave
me
a
certain
sort
of
satisfaction
to
find
myself
*NL*
so
sought
and
prized
by
a
gentleman
of
such
distinction
,
and
I
was
not
*NL*
displeased
at
seeing
my
praises
in
his
letters
-LRB-
for
however
ugly
we
women
*NL*
may
be
,
it
seems
to
me
it
always
pleases
us
to
hear
ourselves
called
*NL*
beautiful
-RRB-
but
that
my
own
sense
of
right
was
opposed
to
all
this
,
as
*NL*
well
as
the
repeated
advice
of
my
parents
,
who
now
very
plainly
perceived
*NL*
Don
Fernando
's
purpose
,
for
he
cared
very
little
if
all
the
world
knew
*NL*
it
.
They
told
me
they
trusted
and
confided
their
honour
and
good
name
to
*NL*
my
virtue
and
rectitude
alone
,
and
bade
me
consider
the
disparity
between
*NL*
Don
Fernando
and
myself
,
from
which
I
might
conclude
that
his
intentions
,
*NL*
whatever
he
might
say
to
the
contrary
,
had
for
their
aim
his
own
pleasure
*NL*
rather
than
my
advantage
;
and
if
I
were
at
all
desirous
of
opposing
an
*NL*
obstacle
to
his
unreasonable
suit
,
they
were
ready
,
they
said
,
to
marry
*NL*
me
at
once
to
anyone
I
preferred
,
either
among
the
leading
people
of
our
*NL*
own
town
,
or
of
any
of
those
in
the
neighbourhood
;
for
with
their
wealth
*NL*
and
my
good
name
,
a
match
might
be
looked
for
in
any
quarter
.
This
offer
,
*NL*
and
their
sound
advice
strengthened
my
resolution
,
and
I
never
gave
Don
*NL*
Fernando
a
word
in
reply
that
could
hold
out
to
him
any
hope
of
success
,
*NL*
however
remote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
caution
of
mine
,
which
he
must
have
taken
for
coyness
,
had
*NL*
apparently
the
effect
of
increasing
his
wanton
appetite
--
for
that
is
the
*NL*
name
I
give
to
his
passion
for
me
;
had
it
been
what
he
declared
it
to
be
,
*NL*
you
would
not
know
of
it
now
,
because
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
*NL*
to
tell
you
of
it
.
At
length
he
learned
that
my
parents
were
*NL*
contemplating
marriage
for
me
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
his
hopes
of
*NL*
obtaining
possession
of
me
,
or
at
least
to
secure
additional
protectors
*NL*
to
watch
over
me
,
and
this
intelligence
or
suspicion
made
him
act
as
you
*NL*
shall
hear
.
One
night
,
as
I
was
in
my
chamber
with
no
other
companion
*NL*
than
a
damsel
who
waited
on
me
,
with
the
doors
carefully
locked
lest
my
*NL*
honour
should
be
imperilled
through
any
carelessness
,
I
know
not
nor
can
*NL*
conceive
how
it
happened
,
but
,
with
all
this
seclusion
and
these
*NL*
precautions
,
and
in
the
solitude
and
silence
of
my
retirement
,
I
found
*NL*
him
standing
before
me
,
a
vision
that
so
astounded
me
that
it
deprived
my
*NL*
eyes
of
sight
,
and
my
tongue
of
speech
.
I
had
no
power
to
utter
a
cry
,
*NL*
nor
,
I
think
,
did
he
give
me
time
to
utter
one
,
as
he
immediately
*NL*
approached
me
,
and
taking
me
in
his
arms
-LRB-
for
,
overwhelmed
as
I
was
,
I
*NL*
was
powerless
,
I
say
,
to
help
myself
-RRB-
,
he
began
to
make
such
professions
*NL*
to
me
that
I
know
not
how
falsehood
could
have
had
the
power
of
dressing
*NL*
them
up
to
seem
so
like
truth
;
and
the
traitor
contrived
that
his
tears
*NL*
should
vouch
for
his
words
,
and
his
sighs
for
his
sincerity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
a
poor
young
creature
alone
,
ill
versed
among
my
people
in
cases
such
*NL*
as
this
,
began
,
I
know
not
how
,
to
think
all
these
lying
protestations
*NL*
true
,
though
without
being
moved
by
his
sighs
and
tears
to
anything
more
*NL*
than
pure
compassion
;
and
so
,
as
the
first
feeling
of
bewilderment
passed
*NL*
away
,
and
I
began
in
some
degree
to
recover
myself
,
I
said
to
him
with
*NL*
more
courage
than
I
thought
I
could
have
possessed
,
`
If
,
as
I
am
now
in
*NL*
your
arms
,
senor
,
I
were
in
the
claws
of
a
fierce
lion
,
and
my
*NL*
deliverance
could
be
procured
by
doing
or
saying
anything
to
the
*NL*
prejudice
of
my
honour
,
it
would
no
more
be
in
my
power
to
do
it
or
say
*NL*
it
,
than
it
would
be
possible
that
what
was
should
not
have
been
;
so
*NL*
then
,
if
you
hold
my
body
clasped
in
your
arms
,
I
hold
my
soul
secured
by
*NL*
virtuous
intentions
,
very
different
from
yours
,
as
you
will
see
if
you
*NL*
attempt
to
carry
them
into
effect
by
force
.
I
am
your
vassal
,
but
I
am
*NL*
not
your
slave
;
your
nobility
neither
has
nor
should
have
any
right
to
*NL*
dishonour
or
degrade
my
humble
birth
;
and
low-born
peasant
as
I
am
,
I
*NL*
have
my
self-respect
as
much
as
you
,
a
lord
and
gentleman
:
with
me
your
*NL*
violence
will
be
to
no
purpose
,
your
wealth
will
have
no
weight
,
your
*NL*
words
will
have
no
power
to
deceive
me
,
nor
your
sighs
or
tears
to
soften
*NL*
me
:
were
I
to
see
any
of
the
things
I
speak
of
in
him
whom
my
parents
*NL*
gave
me
as
a
husband
,
his
will
should
be
mine
,
and
mine
should
be
bounded
*NL*
by
his
;
and
my
honour
being
preserved
even
though
my
inclinations
were
*NL*
not
would
willingly
yield
him
what
you
,
senor
,
would
now
obtain
by
force
;
*NL*
and
this
I
say
lest
you
should
suppose
that
any
but
my
lawful
husband
*NL*
shall
ever
win
anything
of
me
.
'
`
If
that

said
this
disloyal
gentleman

*NL*

be
the
only
scruple
you
feel
,
fairest
Dorothea

-LRB-
for
that
is
the
name
of
*NL*
this
unhappy
being
-RRB-
,

here
I
give
you
my
hand
to
be
yours

Heaven
,
from
which
nothing
is
hid
,
and
this
image
of
Our
Lady

have

here

witnesses
of
this
pledge
.

''
*NL*

When
Cardenio
heard
her
say
she
was
called
Dorothea
,
he
showed
fresh
*NL*
agitation
and
felt
convinced
of
the
truth
of
his
former
suspicion
,
but
he
*NL*
was
unwilling
to
interrupt
the
story
,
and
wished
to
hear
the
end
of
what
*NL*
he
already
all
but
knew
,
so
he
merely
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
is
Dorothea
your
name
,
senora
?
I
have
heard
of
another
of
the
same
*NL*
name
who
can
perhaps
match
your
misfortunes
.
But
proceed
;
by-and-by
I
may
*NL*
tell
you
something
that
will
astonish
you
as
much
as
it
will
excite
your
*NL*
compassion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
struck
by
Cardenio
's
words
as
well
as
by
his
strange
and
*NL*
miserable
attire
,
and
begged
him
if
he
knew
anything
concerning
her
to
*NL*
tell
it
to
her
at
once
,
for
if
fortune
had
left
her
any
blessing
it
was
*NL*
courage
to
bear
whatever
calamity
might
fall
upon
her
,
as
she
felt
sure
*NL*
that
none
could
reach
her
capable
of
increasing
in
any
degree
what
she
*NL*
endured
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
let
the
occasion
pass
,
senora
,
''
replied
Cardenio
,
``
of
*NL*
telling
you
what
I
think
,
if
what
I
suspect
were
the
truth
,
but
so
far
*NL*
there
has
been
no
opportunity
,
nor
is
it
of
any
importance
to
you
to
know
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
it
as
it
may
,
''
replied
Dorothea
,
``
what
happened
in
my
story
was
that
*NL*
Don
Fernando
,
taking
an
image
that
stood
in
the
chamber
,
placed
it
as
a
*NL*
witness
of
our
betrothal
,
and
with
the
most
binding
words
and
extravagant
*NL*
oaths
gave
me
his
promise
to
become
my
husband
;
though
before
he
had
made
*NL*
an
end
of
pledging
himself
I
bade
him
consider
well
what
he
was
doing
,
*NL*
and
think
of
the
anger
his
father
would
feel
at
seeing
him
married
to
a
*NL*
peasant
girl
and
one
of
his
vassals
;
I
told
him
not
to
let
my
beauty
,
*NL*
such
as
it
was
,
blind
him
,
for
that
was
not
enough
to
furnish
an
excuse
*NL*
for
his
transgression
;
and
if
in
the
love
he
bore
me
he
wished
to
do
me
*NL*
any
kindness
,
it
would
be
to
leave
my
lot
to
follow
its
course
at
the
*NL*
level
my
condition
required
;
for
marriages
so
unequal
never
brought
*NL*
happiness
,
nor
did
they
continue
long
to
afford
the
enjoyment
they
began
*NL*
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
that
I
have
now
repeated
I
said
to
him
,
and
much
more
which
I
*NL*
can
not
recollect
;
but
it
had
no
effect
in
inducing
him
to
forego
his
*NL*
purpose
;
he
who
has
no
intention
of
paying
does
not
trouble
himself
about
*NL*
difficulties
when
he
is
striking
the
bargain
.
At
the
same
time
I
argued
*NL*
the
matter
briefly
in
my
own
mind
,
saying
to
myself
,
'
I
shall
not
be
the
*NL*
first
who
has
risen
through
marriage
from
a
lowly
to
a
lofty
station
,
nor
*NL*
will
Don
Fernando
be
the
first
whom
beauty
or
,
as
is
more
likely
,
a
blind
*NL*
attachment
,
has
led
to
mate
himself
below
his
rank
.
Then
,
since
I
am
*NL*
introducing
no
new
usage
or
practice
,
I
may
as
well
avail
myself
of
the
*NL*
honour
that
chance
offers
me
,
for
even
though
his
inclination
for
me
*NL*
should
not
outlast
the
attainment
of
his
wishes
,
I
shall
be
,
after
all
,
*NL*
his
wife
before
God
.
And
if
I
strive
to
repel
him
by
scorn
,
I
can
see
*NL*
that
,
fair
means
failing
,
he
is
in
a
mood
to
use
force
,
and
I
shall
be
*NL*
left
dishonoured
and
without
any
means
of
proving
my
innocence
to
those
*NL*
who
can
not
know
how
innocently
I
have
come
to
be
in
this
position
;
for
*NL*
what
arguments
would
persuade
my
parents
that
this
gentleman
entered
my
*NL*
chamber
without
my
consent
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
these
questions
and
answers
passed
through
my
mind
in
a
moment
;
but
*NL*
the
oaths
of
Don
Fernando
,
the
witnesses
he
appealed
to
,
the
tears
he
*NL*
shed
,
and
lastly
the
charms
of
his
person
and
his
high-bred
grace
,
which
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
such
signs
of
genuine
love
,
might
well
have
conquered
a
*NL*
heart
even
more
free
and
coy
than
mine
--
these
were
the
things
that
more
*NL*
than
all
began
to
influence
me
and
lead
me
unawares
to
my
ruin
.
I
called
*NL*
my
waiting-maid
to
me
,
that
there
might
be
a
witness
on
earth
besides
*NL*
those
in
Heaven
,
and
again
Don
Fernando
renewed
and
repeated
his
oaths
,
*NL*
invoked
as
witnesses
fresh
saints
in
addition
to
the
former
ones
,
called
*NL*
down
upon
himself
a
thousand
curses
hereafter
should
he
fail
to
keep
his
*NL*
promise
,
shed
more
tears
,
redoubled
his
sighs
and
pressed
me
closer
in
*NL*
his
arms
,
from
which
he
had
never
allowed
me
to
escape
;
and
so
I
was
left
*NL*
by
my
maid
,
and
ceased
to
be
one
,
and
he
became
a
traitor
and
a
perjured
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
which
followed
the
night
of
my
misfortune
did
not
come
so
*NL*
quickly
,
I
imagine
,
as
Don
Fernando
wished
,
for
when
desire
has
attained
*NL*
its
object
,
the
greatest
pleasure
is
to
fly
from
the
scene
of
pleasure
.
I
*NL*
say
so
because
Don
Fernando
made
all
haste
to
leave
me
,
and
by
the
*NL*
adroitness
of
my
maid
,
who
was
indeed
the
one
who
had
admitted
him
,
*NL*
gained
the
street
before
daybreak
;
but
on
taking
leave
of
me
he
told
me
,
*NL*
though
not
with
as
much
earnestness
and
fervour
as
when
he
came
,
that
I
*NL*
might
rest
assured
of
his
faith
and
of
the
sanctity
and
sincerity
of
his
*NL*
oaths
;
and
to
confirm
his
words
he
drew
a
rich
ring
off
his
finger
and
*NL*
placed
it
upon
mine
.
He
then
took
his
departure
and
I
was
left
,
I
know
*NL*
not
whether
sorrowful
or
happy
;
all
I
can
say
is
,
I
was
left
agitated
and
*NL*
troubled
in
mind
and
almost
bewildered
by
what
had
taken
place
,
and
I
had
*NL*
not
the
spirit
,
or
else
it
did
not
occur
to
me
,
to
chide
my
maid
for
the
*NL*
treachery
she
had
been
guilty
of
in
concealing
Don
Fernando
in
my
*NL*
chamber
;
for
as
yet
I
was
unable
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
what
had
*NL*
befallen
me
was
for
good
or
evil
.
I
told
Don
Fernando
at
parting
,
that
as
*NL*
I
was
now
his
,
he
might
see
me
on
other
nights
in
the
same
way
,
until
it
*NL*
should
be
his
pleasure
to
let
the
matter
become
known
;
but
,
except
the
*NL*
following
night
,
he
came
no
more
,
nor
for
more
than
a
month
could
I
catch
*NL*
a
glimpse
of
him
in
the
street
or
in
church
,
while
I
wearied
myself
with
*NL*
watching
for
one
;
although
I
knew
he
was
in
the
town
,
and
almost
every
*NL*
day
went
out
hunting
,
a
pastime
he
was
very
fond
of
.
I
remember
well
how
*NL*
sad
and
dreary
those
days
and
hours
were
to
me
;
I
remember
well
how
I
*NL*
began
to
doubt
as
they
went
by
,
and
even
to
lose
confidence
in
the
faith
*NL*
of
Don
Fernando
;
and
I
remember
,
too
,
how
my
maid
heard
those
words
in
*NL*
reproof
of
her
audacity
that
she
had
not
heard
before
,
and
how
I
was
*NL*
forced
to
put
a
constraint
on
my
tears
and
on
the
expression
of
my
*NL*
countenance
,
not
to
give
my
parents
cause
to
ask
me
why
I
was
so
*NL*
melancholy
,
and
drive
me
to
invent
falsehoods
in
reply
.
But
all
this
was
*NL*
suddenly
brought
to
an
end
,
for
the
time
came
when
all
such
*NL*
considerations
were
disregarded
,
and
there
was
no
further
question
of
*NL*
honour
,
when
my
patience
gave
way
and
the
secret
of
my
heart
became
known
*NL*
abroad
.
The
reason
was
,
that
a
few
days
later
it
was
reported
in
the
town
*NL*
that
Don
Fernando
had
been
married
in
a
neighbouring
city
to
a
maiden
of
*NL*
rare
beauty
,
the
daughter
of
parents
of
distinguished
position
,
though
*NL*
not
so
rich
that
her
portion
would
entitle
her
to
look
for
so
brilliant
a
*NL*
match
;
it
was
said
,
too
,
that
her
name
was
Luscinda
,
and
that
at
the
*NL*
betrothal
some
strange
things
had
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cardenio
heard
the
name
of
Luscinda
,
but
he
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
*NL*
bit
his
lips
,
bent
his
brows
,
and
before
long
two
streams
of
tears
*NL*
escaped
from
his
eyes
.
Dorothea
,
however
,
did
not
interrupt
her
story
,
*NL*
but
went
on
in
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
sad
intelligence
reached
my
ears
,
and
,
instead
of
being
struck
with
*NL*
a
chill
,
with
such
wrath
and
fury
did
my
heart
burn
that
I
scarcely
*NL*
restrained
myself
from
rushing
out
into
the
streets
,
crying
aloud
and
*NL*
proclaiming
openly
the
perfidy
and
treachery
of
which
I
was
the
victim
;
*NL*
but
this
transport
of
rage
was
for
the
time
checked
by
a
resolution
I
*NL*
formed
,
to
be
carried
out
the
same
night
,
and
that
was
to
assume
this
*NL*
dress
,
which
I
got
from
a
servant
of
my
father
's
,
one
of
the
zagals
,
as
*NL*
they
are
called
in
farmhouses
,
to
whom
I
confided
the
whole
of
my
*NL*
misfortune
,
and
whom
I
entreated
to
accompany
me
to
the
city
where
I
*NL*
heard
my
enemy
was
.
He
,
though
he
remonstrated
with
me
for
my
boldness
,
*NL*
and
condemned
my
resolution
,
when
he
saw
me
bent
upon
my
purpose
,
offered
*NL*
to
bear
me
company
,
as
he
said
,
to
the
end
of
the
world
.
I
at
once
packed
*NL*
up
in
a
linen
pillow-case
a
woman
's
dress
,
and
some
jewels
and
money
to
*NL*
provide
for
emergencies
,
and
in
the
silence
of
the
night
,
without
letting
*NL*
my
treacherous
maid
know
,
I
sallied
forth
from
the
house
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
my
servant
and
abundant
anxieties
,
and
on
foot
set
out
for
the
city
,
but
*NL*
borne
as
it
were
on
wings
by
my
eagerness
to
reach
it
,
if
not
to
prevent
*NL*
what
I
presumed
to
be
already
done
,
at
least
to
call
upon
Don
Fernando
to
*NL*
tell
me
with
what
conscience
he
had
done
it
.
I
reached
my
destination
in
*NL*
two
days
and
a
half
,
and
on
entering
the
city
inquired
for
the
house
of
*NL*
Luscinda
's
parents
.
The
first
person
I
asked
gave
me
more
in
reply
than
I
*NL*
sought
to
know
;
he
showed
me
the
house
,
and
told
me
all
that
had
occurred
*NL*
at
the
betrothal
of
the
daughter
of
the
family
,
an
affair
of
such
*NL*
notoriety
in
the
city
that
it
was
the
talk
of
every
knot
of
idlers
in
the
*NL*
street
.
He
said
that
on
the
night
of
Don
Fernando
's
betrothal
with
*NL*
Luscinda
,
as
soon
as
she
had
consented
to
be
his
bride
by
saying
`
Yes
,
'
*NL*
she
was
taken
with
a
sudden
fainting
fit
,
and
that
on
the
bridegroom
*NL*
approaching
to
unlace
the
bosom
of
her
dress
to
give
her
air
,
he
found
a
*NL*
paper
in
her
own
handwriting
,
in
which
she
said
and
declared
that
she
*NL*
could
not
be
Don
Fernando
's
bride
,
because
she
was
already
Cardenio
's
,
*NL*
who
,
according
to
the
man
's
account
,
was
a
gentleman
of
distinction
of
*NL*
the
same
city
;
and
that
if
she
had
accepted
Don
Fernando
,
it
was
only
in
*NL*
obedience
to
her
parents
.
In
short
,
he
said
,
the
words
of
the
paper
made
*NL*
it
clear
she
meant
to
kill
herself
on
the
completion
of
the
betrothal
,
*NL*
and
gave
her
reasons
for
putting
an
end
to
herself
all
which
was
*NL*
confirmed
,
it
was
said
,
by
a
dagger
they
found
somewhere
in
her
clothes
.
*NL*
On
seeing
this
,
Don
Fernando
,
persuaded
that
Luscinda
had
befooled
,
*NL*
slighted
,
and
trifled
with
him
,
assailed
her
before
she
had
recovered
*NL*
from
her
swoon
,
and
tried
to
stab
her
with
the
dagger
that
had
been
*NL*
found
,
and
would
have
succeeded
had
not
her
parents
and
those
who
were
*NL*
present
prevented
him
.
It
was
said
,
moreover
,
that
Don
Fernando
went
away
*NL*
at
once
,
and
that
Luscinda
did
not
recover
from
her
prostration
until
the
*NL*
next
day
,
when
she
told
her
parents
how
she
was
really
the
bride
of
that
*NL*
Cardenio
I
have
mentioned
.
I
learned
besides
that
Cardenio
,
according
to
*NL*
report
,
had
been
present
at
the
betrothal
;
and
that
upon
seeing
her
*NL*
betrothed
contrary
to
his
expectation
,
he
had
quitted
the
city
in
*NL*
despair
,
leaving
behind
him
a
letter
declaring
the
wrong
Luscinda
had
*NL*
done
him
,
and
his
intention
of
going
where
no
one
should
ever
see
him
*NL*
again
.
All
this
was
a
matter
of
notoriety
in
the
city
,
and
everyone
spoke
*NL*
of
it
;
especially
when
it
became
known
that
Luscinda
was
missing
from
her
*NL*
father
's
house
and
from
the
city
,
for
she
was
not
to
be
found
anywhere
,
*NL*
to
the
distraction
of
her
parents
,
who
knew
not
what
steps
to
take
to
*NL*
recover
her
.
What
I
learned
revived
my
hopes
,
and
I
was
better
pleased
*NL*
not
to
have
found
Don
Fernando
than
to
find
him
married
,
for
it
seemed
to
*NL*
me
that
the
door
was
not
yet
entirely
shut
upon
relief
in
my
case
,
and
I
*NL*
thought
that
perhaps
Heaven
had
put
this
impediment
in
the
way
of
the
*NL*
second
marriage
,
to
lead
him
to
recognise
his
obligations
under
the
*NL*
former
one
,
and
reflect
that
as
a
Christian
he
was
bound
to
consider
his
*NL*
soul
above
all
human
objects
.
All
this
passed
through
my
mind
,
and
I
*NL*
strove
to
comfort
myself
without
comfort
,
indulging
in
faint
and
distant
*NL*
hopes
of
cherishing
that
life
that
I
now
abhor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
while
I
was
in
the
city
,
uncertain
what
to
do
,
as
I
could
not
find
*NL*
Don
Fernando
,
I
heard
notice
given
by
the
public
crier
offering
a
great
*NL*
reward
to
anyone
who
should
find
me
,
and
giving
the
particulars
of
my
age
*NL*
and
of
the
very
dress
I
wore
;
and
I
heard
it
said
that
the
lad
who
came
*NL*
with
me
had
taken
me
away
from
my
father
's
house
;
a
thing
that
cut
me
to
*NL*
the
heart
,
showing
how
low
my
good
name
had
fallen
,
since
it
was
not
*NL*
enough
that
I
should
lose
it
by
my
flight
,
but
they
must
add
with
whom
I
*NL*
had
fled
,
and
that
one
so
much
beneath
me
and
so
unworthy
of
my
*NL*
consideration
.
The
instant
I
heard
the
notice
I
quitted
the
city
with
my
*NL*
servant
,
who
now
began
to
show
signs
of
wavering
in
his
fidelity
to
me
,
*NL*
and
the
same
night
,
for
fear
of
discovery
,
we
entered
the
most
thickly
*NL*
wooded
part
of
these
mountains
.
But
,
as
is
commonly
said
,
one
evil
calls
*NL*
up
another
and
the
end
of
one
misfortune
is
apt
to
be
the
beginning
of
*NL*
one
still
greater
,
and
so
it
proved
in
my
case
;
for
my
worthy
servant
,
*NL*
until
then
so
faithful
and
trusty
when
he
found
me
in
this
lonely
spot
,
*NL*
moved
more
by
his
own
villainy
than
by
my
beauty
,
sought
to
take
*NL*
advantage
of
the
opportunity
which
these
solitudes
seemed
to
present
him
,
*NL*
and
with
little
shame
and
less
fear
of
God
and
respect
for
me
,
began
to
*NL*
make
overtures
to
me
;
and
finding
that
I
replied
to
the
effrontery
of
his
*NL*
proposals
with
justly
severe
language
,
he
laid
aside
the
entreaties
which
*NL*
he
had
employed
at
first
,
and
began
to
use
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
just
Heaven
,
that
seldom
fails
to
watch
over
and
aid
good
intentions
,
*NL*
so
aided
mine
that
with
my
slight
strength
and
with
little
exertion
I
*NL*
pushed
him
over
a
precipice
,
where
I
left
him
,
whether
dead
or
alive
I
*NL*
know
not
;
and
then
,
with
greater
speed
than
seemed
possible
in
my
terror
*NL*
and
fatigue
,
I
made
my
way
into
the
mountains
,
without
any
other
thought
*NL*
or
purpose
save
that
of
hiding
myself
among
them
,
and
escaping
my
father
*NL*
and
those
despatched
in
search
of
me
by
his
orders
.
It
is
now
I
know
not
*NL*
how
many
months
since
with
this
object
I
came
here
,
where
I
met
a
*NL*
herdsman
who
engaged
me
as
his
servant
at
a
place
in
the
heart
of
this
*NL*
Sierra
,
and
all
this
time
I
have
been
serving
him
as
herd
,
striving
to
*NL*
keep
always
afield
to
hide
these
locks
which
have
now
unexpectedly
*NL*
betrayed
me
.
But
all
my
care
and
pains
were
unavailing
,
for
my
master
*NL*
made
the
discovery
that
I
was
not
a
man
,
and
harboured
the
same
base
*NL*
designs
as
my
servant
;
and
as
fortune
does
not
always
supply
a
remedy
in
*NL*
cases
of
difficulty
,
and
I
had
no
precipice
or
ravine
at
hand
down
which
*NL*
to
fling
the
master
and
cure
his
passion
,
as
I
had
in
the
servant
's
case
,
*NL*
I
thought
it
a
lesser
evil
to
leave
him
and
again
conceal
myself
among
*NL*
these
crags
,
than
make
trial
of
my
strength
and
argument
with
him
.
So
,
as
*NL*
I
say
,
once
more
I
went
into
hiding
to
seek
for
some
place
where
I
might
*NL*
with
sighs
and
tears
implore
Heaven
to
have
pity
on
my
misery
,
and
grant
*NL*
me
help
and
strength
to
escape
from
it
,
or
let
me
die
among
the
*NL*
solitudes
,
leaving
no
trace
of
an
unhappy
being
who
,
by
no
fault
of
hers
,
*NL*
has
furnished
matter
for
talk
and
scandal
at
home
and
abroad
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
,
sirs
,
is
the
true
story
of
my
sad
adventures
;
judge
for
yourselves
*NL*
now
whether
the
sighs
and
lamentations
you
heard
,
and
the
tears
that
*NL*
flowed
from
my
eyes
,
had
not
sufficient
cause
even
if
I
had
indulged
in
*NL*
them
more
freely
;
and
if
you
consider
the
nature
of
my
misfortune
you
*NL*
will
see
that
consolation
is
idle
,
as
there
is
no
possible
remedy
for
it
.
*NL*
All
I
ask
of
you
is
,
what
you
may
easily
and
reasonably
do
,
to
show
me
*NL*
where
I
may
pass
my
life
unharassed
by
the
fear
and
dread
of
discovery
by
*NL*
those
who
are
in
search
of
me
;
for
though
the
great
love
my
parents
bear
*NL*
me
makes
me
feel
sure
of
being
kindly
received
by
them
,
so
great
is
my
*NL*
feeling
of
shame
at
the
mere
thought
that
I
can
not
present
myself
before
*NL*
them
as
they
expect
,
that
I
had
rather
banish
myself
from
their
sight
for
*NL*
ever
than
look
them
in
the
face
with
the
reflection
that
they
beheld
mine
*NL*
stripped
of
that
purity
they
had
a
right
to
expect
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
she
became
silent
,
and
the
colour
that
overspread
her
*NL*
face
showed
plainly
the
pain
and
shame
she
was
suffering
at
heart
.
In
*NL*
theirs
the
listeners
felt
as
much
pity
as
wonder
at
her
misfortunes
;
but
*NL*
as
the
curate
was
just
about
to
offer
her
some
consolation
and
advice
*NL*
Cardenio
forestalled
him
,
saying
,
``
So
then
,
senora
,
you
are
the
fair
*NL*
Dorothea
,
the
only
daughter
of
the
rich
Clenardo
?
''
Dorothea
was
*NL*
astonished
at
hearing
her
father
's
name
,
and
at
the
miserable
appearance
*NL*
of
him
who
mentioned
it
,
for
it
has
been
already
said
how
wretchedly
clad
*NL*
Cardenio
was
;
so
she
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
may
you
be
,
brother
,
who
seem
to
know
my
father
's
name
so
well
?
*NL*
For
so
far
,
if
I
remember
rightly
,
I
have
not
mentioned
it
in
the
whole
*NL*
story
of
my
misfortunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
that
unhappy
being
,
senora
,
''
replied
Cardenio
,
``
whom
,
as
you
have
*NL*
said
,
Luscinda
declared
to
be
her
husband
;
I
am
the
unfortunate
Cardenio
,
*NL*
whom
the
wrong-doing
of
him
who
has
brought
you
to
your
present
condition
*NL*
has
reduced
to
the
state
you
see
me
in
,
bare
,
ragged
,
bereft
of
all
human
*NL*
comfort
,
and
what
is
worse
,
of
reason
,
for
I
only
possess
it
when
Heaven
*NL*
is
pleased
for
some
short
space
to
restore
it
to
me

I
,
Dorothea
,
am
he

who
witnessed
the
wrong
done
by
Don

waited
to

courage
enough
to
see
how
her
fainting
fit
ended
,
or
what
came
of
*NL*
the
paper
that
was
found
in
her
bosom
,
because
my
heart
had
not
the
*NL*
fortitude
to
endure
so
many
strokes
of
ill-fortune
at
once
;
and
so
losing
*NL*
patience
I
quitted
the
house
,
and
leaving
a
letter
with
my
host
,
which
I
*NL*
entreated
him
to
place
in
Luscinda
's
hands
,
I
betook
myself
to
these
*NL*
solitudes
,
resolved
to
end
here
the
life
I
hated
as
if
it
were
my
mortal
*NL*
enemy
.
But
fate
would
not
rid
me
of
it
,
contenting
itself
with
robbing
me
*NL*
of
my
reason
,
perhaps
to
preserve
me
for
the
good
fortune
I
have
had
in
*NL*
meeting
you
;
for
if
that
which
you
have
just
told
us
be
true
,
as
I
*NL*
believe
it
to
be
,
it
may
be
that
Heaven
has
yet
in
store
for
both
of
us
a
*NL*
happier
termination
to
our
misfortunes
than
we
look
for
;
because
seeing
*NL*
that
Luscinda
can
not
marry
Don
Fernando
,
being
mine
,
as
she
has
herself
*NL*
so
openly
declared
,
and
that
Don
Fernando
can
not
marry
her
as
he
is
*NL*
yours
,
we
may
reasonably
hope
that
Heaven
will
restore
to
us
what
is
*NL*
ours
,
as
it
is
still
in
existence
and
not
yet
alienated
or
destroyed
.
And
*NL*
as
we
have
this
consolation
springing
from
no
very
visionary
hope
or
wild
*NL*
fancy
,
I
entreat
you
,
senora
,
to
form
new
resolutions
in
your
better
*NL*
mind
,
as
I
mean
to
do
in
mine
,
preparing
yourself
to
look
forward
to
*NL*
happier
fortunes
;
for
I
swear
to
you
by
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
and
a
*NL*
Christian
not
to
desert
you
until
I
see
you
in
possession
of
Don
*NL*
Fernando
,
and
if
I
can
not
by
words
induce
him
to
recognise
his
obligation
*NL*
to
you
,
in
that
case
to
avail
myself
of
the
right
which
my
rank
as
a
*NL*
gentleman
gives
me
,
and
with
just
cause
challenge
him
on
account
of
the
*NL*
injury
he
has
done
you
,
not
regarding
my
own
wrongs
,
which
I
shall
leave
*NL*
to
Heaven
to
avenge
,
while
I
on
earth
devote
myself
to
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cardenio
's
words
completed
the
astonishment
of
Dorothea
,
and
not
knowing
*NL*
how
to
return
thanks
for
such
an
offer
,
she
attempted
to
kiss
his
feet
;
*NL*
but
Cardenio
would
not
permit
it
,
and
the
licentiate
replied
for
both
,
*NL*
commended
the
sound
reasoning
of
Cardenio
,
and
lastly
,
begged
,
advised
,
*NL*
and
urged
them
to
come
with
him
to
his
village
,
where
they
might
furnish
*NL*
themselves
with
what
they
needed
,
and
take
measures
to
discover
Don
*NL*
Fernando
,
or
restore
Dorothea
to
her
parents
,
or
do
what
seemed
to
them
*NL*
most
advisable
.
Cardenio
and
Dorothea
thanked
him
,
and
accepted
the
kind
*NL*
offer
he
made
them
;
and
the
barber
,
who
had
been
listening
to
all
*NL*
attentively
and
in
silence
,
on
his
part
some
kindly
words
also
,
and
with
*NL*
no
less
good-will
than
the
curate
offered
his
services
in
any
way
that
*NL*
might
be
of
use
to
them
.
He
also
explained
to
them
in
a
few
words
the
*NL*
object
that
had
brought
them
there
,
and
the
strange
nature
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
madness
,
and
how
they
were
waiting
for
his
squire
,
who
had
gone
*NL*
in
search
of
him
.
Like
the
recollection
of
a
dream
,
the
quarrel
he
had
*NL*
had
with
Don
Quixote
came
back
to
Cardenio
's
memory
,
and
he
described
it
*NL*
to
the
others
;
but
he
was
unable
to
say
what
the
dispute
was
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
they
heard
a
shout
,
and
recognised
it
as
coming
from
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
,
who
,
not
finding
them
where
he
had
left
them
,
was
calling
*NL*
aloud
to
them
.
They
went
to
meet
him
,
and
in
answer
to
their
inquiries
*NL*
about
Don
Quixote
,
he
told
them
how
he
had
found
him
stripped
to
his
*NL*
shirt
,
lank
,
yellow
,
half
dead
with
hunger
,
and
sighing
for
his
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
;
and
although
he
had
told
him
that
she
commanded
him
to
quit
*NL*
that
place
and
come
to
El
Toboso
,
where
she
was
expecting
him
,
he
had
*NL*
answered
that
he
was
determined
not
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
her
*NL*
beauty
until
he
had
done
deeds
to
make
him
worthy
of
her
favour
;
and
if
*NL*
this
went
on
,
Sancho
said
,
he
ran
the
risk
of
not
becoming
an
emperor
as
*NL*
in
duty
bound
,
or
even
an
archbishop
,
which
was
the
least
he
could
be
;
*NL*
for
which
reason
they
ought
to
consider
what
was
to
be
done
to
get
him
*NL*
away
from
there
.
The
licentiate
in
reply
told
him
not
to
be
uneasy
,
for
*NL*
they
would
fetch
him
away
in
spite
of
himself
.
He
then
told
Cardenio
and
*NL*
Dorothea
what
they
had
proposed
to
do
to
cure
Don
Quixote
,
or
at
any
rate
*NL*
take
him
home
;
upon
which
Dorothea
said
that
she
could
play
the
*NL*
distressed
damsel
better
than
the
barber
;
especially
as
she
had
there
the
*NL*
dress
in
which
to
do
it
to
the
life
,
and
that
they
might
trust
to
her
*NL*
acting
the
part
in
every
particular
requisite
for
carrying
out
their
*NL*
scheme
,
for
she
had
read
a
great
many
books
of
chivalry
,
and
knew
exactly
*NL*
the
style
in
which
afflicted
damsels
begged
boons
of
knights-errant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
there
is
nothing
more
required
than
to
*NL*
set
about
it
at
once
,
for
beyond
a
doubt
fortune
is
declaring
itself
in
*NL*
our
favour
,
since
it
has
so
unexpectedly
begun
to
open
a
door
for
your
*NL*
relief
,
and
smoothed
the
way
for
us
to
our
object
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
then
took
out
of
her
pillow-case
a
complete
petticoat
of
some
*NL*
rich
stuff
,
and
a
green
mantle
of
some
other
fine
material
,
and
a
*NL*
necklace
and
other
ornaments
out
of
a
little
box
,
and
with
these
in
an
*NL*
instant
she
so
arrayed
herself
that
she
looked
like
a
great
and
rich
*NL*
lady
.
All
this
,
and
more
,
she
said
,
she
had
taken
from
home
in
case
of
*NL*
need
,
but
that
until
then
she
had
had
no
occasion
to
make
use
of
it
.
They
*NL*
were
all
highly
delighted
with
her
grace
,
air
,
and
beauty
,
and
declared
*NL*
Don
Fernando
to
be
a
man
of
very
little
taste
when
he
rejected
such
*NL*
charms
.
But
the
one
who
admired
her
most
was
Sancho
Panza
,
for
it
seemed
*NL*
to
him
-LRB-
what
indeed
was
true
-RRB-
that
in
all
the
days
of
his
life
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
such
a
lovely
creature
;
and
he
asked
the
curate
with
great
*NL*
eagerness
who
this
beautiful
lady
was
,
and
what
she
wanted
in
these
*NL*
out-of-the-way
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
fair
lady
,
brother
Sancho
,
''
replied
the
curate
,
``
is
no
less
a
*NL*
personage
than
the
heiress
in
the
direct
male
line
of
the
great
kingdom
*NL*
of
Micomicon
,
who
has
come
in
search
of
your
master
to
beg
a
boon
of
him
,
*NL*
which
is
that
he
redress
a
wrong
or
injury
that
a
wicked
giant
has
done
*NL*
her
;
and
from
the
fame
as
a
good
knight
which
your
master
has
acquired
*NL*
far
and
wide
,
this
princess
has
come
from
Guinea
to
seek
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lucky
seeking
and
a
lucky
finding
!
''
said
Sancho
Panza
at
this
;
*NL*
``
especially
if
my
master
has
the
good
fortune
to
redress
that
injury
,
and
*NL*
right
that
wrong
,
and
kill
that
son
of
a
bitch
of
a
giant
your
worship
*NL*
speaks
of
;
as
kill
him
he
will
if
he
meets
him
,
unless
,
indeed
,
he
*NL*
happens
to
be
a
phantom
;
for
my
master
has
no
power
at
all
against
*NL*
phantoms
.
But
one
thing
among
others
I
would
beg
of
you
,
senor
*NL*
licentiate
,
which
is
,
that
,
to
prevent
my
master
taking
a
fancy
to
be
an
*NL*
archbishop
,
for
that
is
what
I
'm
afraid
of
,
your
worship
would
recommend
*NL*
him
to
marry
this
princess
at
once
;
for
in
this
way
he
will
be
disabled
*NL*
from
taking
archbishop
's
orders
,
and
will
easily
come
into
his
empire
,
*NL*
and
I
to
the
end
of
my
desires
;
I
have
been
thinking
over
the
matter
*NL*
carefully
,
and
by
what
I
can
make
out
I
find
it
will
not
do
for
me
that
*NL*
my
master
should
become
an
archbishop
,
because
I
am
no
good
for
the
*NL*
Church
,
as
I
am
married
;
and
for
me
now
,
having
as
I
have
a
wife
and
*NL*
children
,
to
set
about
obtaining
dispensations
to
enable
me
to
hold
a
*NL*
place
of
profit
under
the
Church
,
would
be
endless
work
;
so
that
,
senor
,
*NL*
it
all
turns
on
my
master
marrying
this
lady
at
once
--
for
as
yet
I
do
not
*NL*
know
her
grace
,
and
so
I
can
not
call
her
by
her
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
called
the
Princess
Micomicona
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
for
as
her
*NL*
kingdom
is
Micomicon
,
it
is
clear
that
must
be
her
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
doubt
of
that
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
for
I
have
known
many
to
*NL*
take
their
name
and
title
from
the
place
where
they
were
born
and
call
*NL*
themselves
Pedro
of
Alcala
,
Juan
of
Ubeda
,
and
Diego
of
Valladolid
;
and
*NL*
it
may
be
that
over
there
in
Guinea
queens
have
the
same
way
of
taking
*NL*
the
names
of
their
kingdoms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
may
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
and
as
for
your
master
's
marrying
,
I
will
*NL*
do
all
in
my
power
towards
it
:
''
with
which
Sancho
was
as
much
pleased
as
*NL*
the
curate
was
amazed
at
his
simplicity
and
at
seeing
what
a
hold
the
*NL*
absurdities
of
his
master
had
taken
of
his
fancy
,
for
he
had
evidently
*NL*
persuaded
himself
that
he
was
going
to
be
an
emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Dorothea
had
seated
herself
upon
the
curate
's
mule
,
and
the
*NL*
barber
had
fitted
the
ox-tail
beard
to
his
face
,
and
they
now
told
Sancho
*NL*
to
conduct
them
to
where
Don
Quixote
was
,
warning
him
not
to
say
that
he
*NL*
knew
either
the
licentiate
or
the
barber
,
as
his
master
's
becoming
an
*NL*
emperor
entirely
depended
on
his
not
recognising
them
;
neither
the
curate
*NL*
nor
Cardenio
,
however
,
thought
fit
to
go
with
them
;
Cardenio
lest
he
*NL*
should
remind
Don
Quixote
of
the
quarrel
he
had
with
him
,
and
the
curate
*NL*
as
there
was
no
necessity
for
his
presence
just
yet
,
so
they
allowed
the
*NL*
others
to
go
on
before
them
,
while
they
themselves
followed
slowly
on
*NL*
foot
.
The
curate
did
not
forget
to
instruct
Dorothea
how
to
act
,
but
she
*NL*
said
they
might
make
their
minds
easy
,
as
everything
would
be
done
*NL*
exactly
as
the
books
of
chivalry
required
and
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
gone
about
three-quarters
of
a
league
when
they
discovered
Don
*NL*
Quixote
in
a
wilderness
of
rocks
,
by
this
time
clothed
,
but
without
his
*NL*
armour
;
and
as
soon
as
Dorothea
saw
him
and
was
told
by
Sancho
that
that
*NL*
was
Don
Quixote
,
she
whipped
her
palfrey
,
the
well-bearded
barber
*NL*
following
her
,
and
on
coming
up
to
him
her
squire
sprang
from
his
mule
*NL*
and
came
forward
to
receive
her
in
his
arms
,
and
she
dismounting
with
*NL*
great
ease
of
manner
advanced
to
kneel
before
the
feet
of
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
and
though
he
strove
to
raise
her
up
,
she
without
rising
addressed
him
in
*NL*
this
fashion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
this
spot
I
will
not
rise
,
valiant
and
doughty
knight
,
until
your
*NL*
goodness
and
courtesy
grant
me
a
boon
,
which
will
redound
to
the
honour
*NL*
and
renown
of
your
person
and
render
a
service
to
the
most
disconsolate
*NL*
and
afflicted
damsel
the
sun
has
seen
;
and
if
the
might
of
your
strong
*NL*
arm
corresponds
to
the
repute
of
your
immortal
fame
,
you
are
bound
to
aid
*NL*
the
helpless
being
who
,
led
by
the
savour
of
your
renowned
name
,
hath
*NL*
come
from
far
distant
lands
to
seek
your
aid
in
her
misfortunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
answer
a
word
,
beauteous
lady
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
nor
*NL*
will
I
listen
to
anything
further
concerning
you
,
until
you
rise
from
the
*NL*
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
rise
,
senor
,
''
answered
the
afflicted
damsel
,
``
unless
of
your
*NL*
courtesy
the
boon
I
ask
is
first
granted
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
grant
and
accord
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
provided
without
detriment
or
*NL*
prejudice
to
my
king
,
my
country
,
or
her
who
holds
the
key
of
my
heart
*NL*
and
freedom
,
it
may
be
complied
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
not
be
to
the
detriment
or
prejudice
of
any
of
them

worthy
*NL*
lord

said
the
afflicted
damsel
;
and
here
Sancho
Panza
drew
close
to
his
*NL*
master
's
ear
and
said
to
him
very
softly
,
``
Your
worship
may
very
safely
*NL*
grant
the
boon
she
asks
;
it
's
nothing
at
all
;
only
to
kill
a
big
giant
;
*NL*
and
she
who
asks
it
is
the
exalted
Princess
Micomicona
,
queen
of
the
*NL*
great
kingdom
of
Micomicon
of
Ethiopia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
be
who
she
may
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
will
do
what
is
my
*NL*
bounden
duty
,
and
what
my
conscience
bids
me
,
in
conformity
with
what
I
*NL*
have
professed
;
''
and
turning
to
the
damsel
he
said
,
``
Let
your
great
*NL*
beauty
rise
,
for
I
grant
the
boon
which
you
would
ask
of
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
I
ask
,
''
said
the
damsel
,
``
is
that
your
magnanimous
person
*NL*
accompany
me
at
once
whither
I
will
conduct
you
,
and
that
you
promise
not
*NL*
to
engage
in
any
other
adventure
or
quest
until
you
have
avenged
me
of
a
*NL*
traitor
who
against
all
human
and
divine
law
,
has
usurped
my
kingdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
repeat
that
I
grant
it
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
so
,
lady
,
you
may
*NL*
from
this
day
forth
lay
aside
the
melancholy
that
distresses
you
,
and
let
*NL*
your
failing
hopes
gather
new
life
and
strength
,
for
with
the
help
of
God
*NL*
and
of
my
arm
you
will
soon
see
yourself
restored
to
your
kingdom
,
and
*NL*
seated
upon
the
throne
of
your
ancient
and
mighty
realm
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
and
despite
of
the
felons
who
would
gainsay
it
;
and
now
hands
to
the
*NL*
work
,
for
in
delay
there
is
apt
to
be
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
distressed
damsel
strove
with
much
pertinacity
to
kiss
his
hands
;
but
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
who
was
in
all
things
a
polished
and
courteous
knight
,
would
*NL*
by
no
means
allow
it
,
but
made
her
rise
and
embraced
her
with
great
*NL*
courtesy
and
politeness
,
and
ordered
Sancho
to
look
to
Rocinante
's
*NL*
girths
,
and
to
arm
him
without
a
moment
's
delay
.
Sancho
took
down
the
*NL*
armour
,
which
was
hung
up
on
a
tree
like
a
trophy
,
and
having
seen
to
the
*NL*
girths
armed
his
master
in
a
trice
,
who
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
in
*NL*
his
armour
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
be
gone
in
the
name
of
God
to
bring
aid
to
this
great
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
barber
was
all
this
time
on
his
knees
at
great
pains
to
hide
his
*NL*
laughter
and
not
let
his
beard
fall
,
for
had
it
fallen
maybe
their
fine
*NL*
scheme
would
have
come
to
nothing
;
but
now
seeing
the
boon
granted
,
and
*NL*
the
promptitude
with
which
Don
Quixote
prepared
to
set
out
in
compliance
*NL*
with
it
,
he
rose
and
took
his
lady
's
hand
,
and
between
them
they
placed
*NL*
her
upon
the
mule
.
Don
Quixote
then
mounted
Rocinante
,
and
the
barber
*NL*
settled
himself
on
his
beast
,
Sancho
being
left
to
go
on
foot
,
which
made
*NL*
him
feel
anew
the
loss
of
his
Dapple
,
finding
the
want
of
him
now
.
But
he
*NL*
bore
all
with
cheerfulness
,
being
persuaded
that
his
master
had
now
*NL*
fairly
started
and
was
just
on
the
point
of
becoming
an
emperor
;
for
he
*NL*
felt
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
would
marry
this
princess
,
and
be
king
of
*NL*
Micomicon
at
least
.
The
only
thing
that
troubled
him
was
the
reflection
*NL*
that
this
kingdom
was
in
the
land
of
the
blacks
,
and
that
the
people
they
*NL*
would
give
him
for
vassals
would
be
all
black
;
but
for
this
he
soon
found
*NL*
a
remedy
in
his
fancy
,
and
said
he
to
himself
,
``
What
is
it
to
me
if
my
*NL*
vassals
are
blacks
?
What
more
have
I
to
do
than
make
a
cargo
of
them
and
*NL*
carry
them
to
Spain
,
where
I
can
sell
them
and
get
ready
money
for
them
,
*NL*
and
with
it
buy
some
title
or
some
office
in
which
to
live
at
ease
all
*NL*
the
days
of
my
life
?
Not
unless
you
go
to
sleep
and
have
n't
the
wit
or
*NL*
skill
to
turn
things
to
account
and
sell
three
,
six
,
or
ten
thousand
*NL*
vassals
while
you
would
be
talking
about
it
!
By
God
I
will
stir
them
up
,
*NL*
big
and
little
,
or
as
best
I
can
,
and
let
them
be
ever
so
black
I
'll
turn
*NL*
them
into
white
or
yellow
.
Come
,
come
,
what
a
fool
I
am
!
''
And
so
he
*NL*
jogged
on
,
so
occupied
with
his
thoughts
and
easy
in
his
mind
that
he
*NL*
forgot
all
about
the
hardship
of
travelling
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cardenio
and
the
curate
were
watching
all
this
from
among
some
bushes
,
*NL*
not
knowing
how
to
join
company
with
the
others
;
but
the
curate
,
who
was
*NL*
very
fertile
in
devices
,
soon
hit
upon
a
way
of
effecting
their
purpose
,
*NL*
and
with
a
pair
of
scissors
he
had
in
a
case
he
quickly
cut
off
*NL*
Cardenio
's
beard
,
and
putting
on
him
a
grey
jerkin
of
his
own
he
gave
him
*NL*
a
black
cloak
,
leaving
himself
in
his
breeches
and
doublet
,
while
*NL*
Cardenio
's
appearance
was
so
different
from
what
it
had
been
that
he
*NL*
would
not
have
known
himself
had
he
seen
himself
in
a
mirror
.
Having
*NL*
effected
this
,
although
the
others
had
gone
on
ahead
while
they
were
*NL*
disguising
themselves
,
they
easily
came
out
on
the
high
road
before
them
,
*NL*
for
the
brambles
and
awkward
places
they
encountered
did
not
allow
those
*NL*
on
horseback
to
go
as
fast
as
those
on
foot
.
They
then
posted
themselves
*NL*
on
the
level
ground
at
the
outlet
of
the
Sierra
,
and
as
soon
as
Don
*NL*
Quixote
and
his
companions
emerged
from
it
the
curate
began
to
examine
*NL*
him
very
deliberately
,
as
though
he
were
striving
to
recognise
him
,
and
*NL*
after
having
stared
at
him
for
some
time
he
hastened
towards
him
with
*NL*
open
arms
exclaiming
,
``
A
happy
meeting
with
the
mirror
of
chivalry
,
my
*NL*
worthy
compatriot
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
the
flower
and
cream
of
high
*NL*
breeding
,
the
protection
and
relief
of
the
distressed
,
the
quintessence
*NL*
of
knights-errant
!
''
And
so
saying
he
clasped
in
his
arms
the
knee
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
left
leg
.
He
,
astonished
at
the
stranger
's
words
and
behaviour
,
*NL*
looked
at
him
attentively
,
and
at
length
recognised
him
,
very
much
*NL*
surprised
to
see
him
there
,
and
made
great
efforts
to
dismount
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
the
curate
would
not
allow
,
on
which
Don
Quixote
said
,
``
Permit
*NL*
me
,
senor
licentiate
,
for
it
is
not
fitting
that
I
should
be
on
horseback
*NL*
and
so
reverend
a
person
as
your
worship
on
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
no
account
will
I
allow
it
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
your
mightiness
must
*NL*
remain
on
horseback
,
for
it
is
on
horseback
you
achieve
the
greatest
*NL*
deeds
and
adventures
that
have
been
beheld
in
our
age
;
as
for
me
,
an
*NL*
unworthy
priest
,
it
will
serve
me
well
enough
to
mount
on
the
haunches
of
*NL*
one
of
the
mules
of
these
gentlefolk
who
accompany
your
worship
,
if
they
*NL*
have
no
objection
,
and
I
will
fancy
I
am
mounted
on
the
steed
Pegasus
,
or
*NL*
on
the
zebra
or
charger
that
bore
the
famous
Moor
,
Muzaraque
,
who
to
this
*NL*
day
lies
enchanted
in
the
great
hill
of
Zulema
,
a
little
distance
from
*NL*
the
great
Complutum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
even
that
will
I
consent
to
,
senor
licentiate
,
''
answered
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
and
I
know
it
will
be
the
good
pleasure
of
my
lady
the
*NL*
princess
,
out
of
love
for
me
,
to
order
her
squire
to
give
up
the
saddle
*NL*
of
his
mule
to
your
worship
,
and
he
can
sit
behind
if
the
beast
will
bear
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
,
I
am
sure
,
''
said
the
princess
,
``
and
I
am
sure
,
too
,
that
I
need
*NL*
not
order
my
squire
,
for
he
is
too
courteous
and
considerate
to
allow
a
*NL*
Churchman
to
go
on
foot
when
he
might
be
mounted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
is
,
''
said
the
barber
,
and
at
once
alighting
,
he
offered
his
*NL*
saddle
to
the
curate
,
who
accepted
it
without
much
entreaty
;
but
*NL*
unfortunately
as
the
barber
was
mounting
behind
,
the
mule
,
being
as
it
*NL*
happened
a
hired
one
,
which
is
the
same
thing
as
saying
ill-conditioned
,
*NL*
lifted
its
hind
hoofs
and
let
fly
a
couple
of
kicks
in
the
air
,
which
*NL*
would
have
made
Master
Nicholas
wish
his
expedition
in
quest
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
at
the
devil
had
they
caught
him
on
the
breast
or
head
.
As
it
*NL*
was
,
they
so
took
him
by
surprise
that
he
came
to
the
ground
,
giving
so
*NL*
little
heed
to
his
beard
that
it
fell
off
,
and
all
he
could
do
when
he
*NL*
found
himself
without
it
was
to
cover
his
face
hastily
with
both
his
*NL*
hands
and
moan
that
his
teeth
were
knocked
out
.
Don
Quixote
when
he
saw
*NL*
all
that
bundle
of
beard
detached
,
without
jaws
or
blood
,
from
the
face
*NL*
of
the
fallen
squire
,
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
living
God
,
but
this
is
a
great
miracle
!
it
has
knocked
off
and
*NL*
plucked
away
the
beard
from
his
face
as
if
it
had
been
shaved
off
*NL*
designedly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
,
seeing
the
danger
of
discovery
that
threatened
his
scheme
,
at
*NL*
once
pounced
upon
the
beard
and
hastened
with
it
to
where
Master
Nicholas
*NL*
lay
,
still
uttering
moans
,
and
drawing
his
head
to
his
breast
had
it
on
*NL*
in
an
instant
,
muttering
over
him
some
words
which
he
said
were
a
certain
*NL*
special
charm
for
sticking
on
beards
,
as
they
would
see
;
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
had
it
fixed
he
left
him
,
and
the
squire
appeared
well
bearded
and
*NL*
whole
as
before
,
whereat
Don
Quixote
was
beyond
measure
astonished
,
and
*NL*
begged
the
curate
to
teach
him
that
charm
when
he
had
an
opportunity
,
as
*NL*
he
was
persuaded
its
virtue
must
extend
beyond
the
sticking
on
of
beards
,
*NL*
for
it
was
clear
that
where
the
beard
had
been
stripped
off
the
flesh
*NL*
must
have
remained
torn
and
lacerated
,
and
when
it
could
heal
all
that
it
*NL*
must
be
good
for
more
than
beards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
it
is
,
''
said
the
curate
,
and
he
promised
to
teach
it
to
him
on
*NL*
the
first
opportunity
.
They
then
agreed
that
for
the
present
the
curate
*NL*
should
mount
,
and
that
the
three
should
ride
by
turns
until
they
reached
*NL*
the
inn
,
which
might
be
about
six
leagues
from
where
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
then
being
mounted
,
that
is
to
say
,
Don
Quixote
,
the
princess
,
and
*NL*
the
curate
,
and
three
on
foot
,
Cardenio
,
the
barber
,
and
Sancho
Panza
,
*NL*
Don
Quixote
said
to
the
damsel
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
your
highness
,
lady
,
lead
on
whithersoever
is
most
pleasing
to
you
;
''
*NL*
but
before
she
could
answer
the
licentiate
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Towards
what
kingdom
would
your
ladyship
direct
our
course
?
Is
it
*NL*
perchance
towards
that
of
Micomicon
?
It
must
be
,
or
else
I
know
little
*NL*
about
kingdoms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
being
ready
on
all
points
,
understood
that
she
was
to
answer
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
so
she
said
``
Yes
,
senor
,
my
way
lies
towards
that
kingdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
we
must
pass
right
through
my
village
,
*NL*
and
there
your
worship
will
take
the
road
to
Cartagena
,
where
you
will
be
*NL*
able
to
embark
,
fortune
favouring
;
and
if
the
wind
be
fair
and
the
sea
*NL*
smooth
and
tranquil
,
in
somewhat
less
than
nine
years
you
may
come
in
*NL*
sight
of
the
great
lake
Meona
,
I
mean
Meotides
,
which
is
little
more
than
*NL*
a
hundred
days
'
journey
this
side
of
your
highness
's
kingdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
is
mistaken
,
senor
,
''
said
she
;
``
for
it
is
not
two
years
*NL*
since
I
set
out
from
it
,
and
though
I
never
had
good
weather
,
*NL*
nevertheless
I
am
here
to
behold
what
I
so
longed
for
,
and
that
is
my
*NL*
lord
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
whose
fame
came
to
my
ears
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
set
foot
in
Spain
and
impelled
me
to
go
in
search
of
him
,
to
commend
*NL*
myself
to
his
courtesy
,
and
entrust
the
justice
of
my
cause
to
the
might
*NL*
of
his
invincible
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
;
no
more
praise
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
,
``
for
I
hate
all
*NL*
flattery
;
and
though
this
may
not
be
so
,
still
language
of
the
kind
is
*NL*
offensive
to
my
chaste
ears
.
I
will
only
say
,
senora
,
that
whether
it
has
*NL*
might
or
not
,
that
which
it
may
or
may
not
have
shall
be
devoted
to
your
*NL*
service
even
to
death
;
and
now
,
leaving
this
to
its
proper
season
,
I
*NL*
would
ask
the
senor
licentiate
to
tell
me
what
it
is
that
has
brought
him
*NL*
into
these
parts
,
alone
,
unattended
,
and
so
lightly
clad
that
I
am
filled
*NL*
with
amazement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
answer
that
briefly
,
''
replied
the
curate
;
``
you
must
know
then
,
*NL*
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
that
Master
Nicholas
,
our
friend
and
barber
,
and
I
*NL*
were
going
to
Seville
to
receive
some
money
that
a
relative
of
mine
who
*NL*
went
to
the
Indies
many
years
ago
had
sent
me
,
and
not
such
a
small
sum
*NL*
but
that
it
was
over
sixty
thousand
pieces
of
eight
,
full
weight
,
which
*NL*
is
something
;
and
passing
by
this
place
yesterday
we
were
attacked
by
*NL*
four
footpads
,
who
stripped
us
even
to
our
beards
,
and
them
they
stripped
*NL*
off
so
that
the
barber
found
it
necessary
to
put
on
a
false
one
,
and
even
*NL*
this
young
man
here
''
-
pointing
to
Cardenio
--
``
they
completely
transformed
.
*NL*
But
the
best
of
it
is
,
the
story
goes
in
the
neighbourhood
that
those
who
*NL*
attacked
us
belong
to
a
number
of
galley
slaves
who
,
they
say
,
were
set
*NL*
free
almost
on
the
very
same

by
a
man
of
such
valour
that
,
in

*NL*
of
the
commissary
and
of
the
guards

he
released
the
whole
of
them
;
and
*NL*
beyond
all
doubt
he
must
have
been
out
of
his
senses
,
or
he
must
be
as
*NL*
great
a
scoundrel
as
they
,
or
some
man
without
heart
or
conscience
to
let
*NL*
the
wolf
loose
among
the
sheep
,
the
fox
among
the
hens
,
the
fly
among
the
*NL*
honey

He
has
defrauded
justice
,
and
opposed
his
king
and
lawful
master
,
*NL*
for
he
opposed
his
just
commands

he
has
,
I
say
,
robbed
the
galleys
of
*NL*
their
feet
,
stirred
up
the
Holy
Brotherhood
which
for
many
years
past
has
*NL*
been
quiet
,
and
,
lastly
,
has
done
a
deed
by
which
his
soul
may
be
lost

without
any
gain
to
his
body

Sancho
had
told
the
curate
and
the
barber
*NL*
of
the
adventure
of
the
galley
slaves
,
which
,
so
much
to
his
glory
,
his
*NL*
master
had
achieved
,
and
hence
the
curate
in
alluding
to
it
made
the
most
*NL*
of
it
to
see
what
would
be
said
or
done
by
Don
Quixote
;
who
changed
*NL*
colour
at
every
word
,
not
daring
to
say
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
the
*NL*
liberator
of
those
worthy
people
.
``
These
,
then
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
were
*NL*
they
who
robbed
us
;
and
God
in
his
mercy
pardon
him
who
would
not
let

them
go
to
the
punishment
they
deserved

*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
ADDRESS
DISPLAYED
BY
THE
FAIR
DOROTHEA
,
WITH
OTHER
*NL*
MATTERS
PLEASANT
AND
AMUSING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
had
hardly
ceased
speaking
,
when
Sancho
said
,
``
In
faith
,
then
,
*NL*
senor
licentiate
,
he
who
did
that
deed
was
my
master
;
and
it
was
not
for
*NL*
want
of
my
telling
him
beforehand
and
warning
him
to
mind
what
he
was
*NL*
about
,
and
that
it
was
a
sin
to
set
them
at
liberty
,
as
they
were
all
on
*NL*
the
march
there
because
they
were
special
scoundrels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blockhead
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
,
``
it
is
no
business
or
concern
of
*NL*
knights-errant
to
inquire
whether
any
persons
in
affliction
,
in
chains
,
*NL*
or
oppressed
that
they
may
meet
on
the
high
roads
go
that
way
and
suffer
*NL*
as
they
do
because
of
their
faults
or
because
of
their
misfortunes
.
It
*NL*
only
concerns
them
to
aid
them
as
persons
in
need
of
help
,
having
regard
*NL*
to
their
sufferings
and
not
to
their
rascalities
.
I
encountered
a
chaplet
*NL*
or
string
of
miserable
and
unfortunate
people
,
and
did
for
them
what
my
*NL*
sense
of
duty
demands
of
me
,
and
as
for
the
rest
be
that
as
it
may
;
and
*NL*
whoever
takes
objection
to
it
,
saving
the
sacred
dignity
of
the
senor
*NL*
licentiate
and
his
honoured
person
,
I
say
he
knows
little
about
chivalry
*NL*
and
lies
like
a
whoreson
villain
,
and
this
I
will
give
him
to
know
to
the
*NL*
fullest
extent
with
my
sword
;
''
and
so
saying
he
settled
himself
in
his
*NL*
stirrups
and
pressed
down
his
morion
;
for
the
barber
's
basin
,
which
*NL*
according
to
him
was
Mambrino
's
helmet
,
he
carried
hanging
at
the
*NL*
saddle-bow
until
he
could
repair
the
damage
done
to
it
by
the
galley
*NL*
slaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
,
who
was
shrewd
and
sprightly
,
and
by
this
time
thoroughly
*NL*
understood
Don
Quixote
's
crazy
turn
,
and
that
all
except
Sancho
Panza
*NL*
were
making
game
of
him
,
not
to
be
behind
the
rest
said
to
him
,
on
*NL*
observing
his
irritation
,
``
Sir
Knight
,
remember
the
boon
you
have
*NL*
promised
me
,
and
that
in
accordance
with
it
you
must
not
engage
in
any
*NL*
other
adventure
,
be
it
ever
so
pressing
;
calm
yourself
,
for
if
the
*NL*
licentiate
had
known
that
the
galley
slaves
had
been
set
free
by
that
*NL*
unconquered
arm
he
would
have
stopped
his
mouth
thrice
over
,
or
even
*NL*
bitten
his
tongue
three
times
before
he
would
have
said
a
word
that
*NL*
tended
towards
disrespect
of
your
worship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
swear
heartily
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
and
I
would
have
even
plucked
*NL*
off
a
moustache
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
hold
my
peace
,
senora
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
I
will
curb
the
*NL*
natural
anger
that
had
arisen
in
my
breast
,
and
will
proceed
in
peace
and
*NL*
quietness
until
I
have
fulfilled
my
promise
;
but
in
return
for
this
*NL*
consideration
I
entreat
you
to
tell
me
,
if
you
have
no
objection
to
do
*NL*
so
,
what
is
the
nature
of
your
trouble
,
and
how
many
,
who
,
and
what
are
*NL*
the
persons
of
whom
I
am
to
require
due
satisfaction
,
and
on
whom
I
am
to
*NL*
take
vengeance
on
your
behalf
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
do
with
all
my
heart
,
''
replied
Dorothea
,
``
if
it
will
not
be
*NL*
wearisome
to
you
to
hear
of
miseries
and
misfortunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
not
be
wearisome
,
senora
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
to
which
Dorothea
*NL*
replied
,
``
Well
,
if
that
be
so
,
give
me
your
attention
.
''
As
soon
as
she
*NL*
said
this
,
Cardenio
and
the
barber
drew
close
to
her
side
,
eager
to
hear
*NL*
what
sort
of
story
the
quick-witted
Dorothea
would
invent
for
herself
;
*NL*
and
Sancho
did
the
same
,
for
he
was
as
much
taken
in
by
her
as
his
*NL*
master
;
and
she
having
settled
herself
comfortably
in
the
saddle
,
and
*NL*
with
the
help
of
coughing
and
other
preliminaries
taken
time
to
think
,
*NL*
began
with
great
sprightliness
of
manner
in
this
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
,
I
would
have
you
know
,
sirs
,
that
my
name
is
-
''
and
here
*NL*
she
stopped
for
a
moment
,
for
she
forgot
the
name
the
curate
had
given
*NL*
her
;
but
he
came
to
her
relief
,
seeing
what
her
difficulty
was
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
It
is
no
wonder
,
senora
,
that
your
highness
should
be
confused
and
*NL*
embarrassed
in
telling
the
tale
of
your
misfortunes
;
for
such
afflictions
*NL*
often
have
the
effect
of
depriving
the
sufferers
of
memory
,
so
that
they
*NL*
do
not
even
remember
their
own
names
,
as
is
the
case
now
with
your
*NL*
ladyship
,
who
has
forgotten
that
she
is
called
the
Princess
Micomicona
,
*NL*
lawful
heiress
of
the
great
kingdom
of
Micomicon
;
and
with
this
cue
your
*NL*
highness
may
now
recall
to
your
sorrowful
recollection
all
you
may
wish
*NL*
to
tell
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
truth
,
''
said
the
damsel
;
``
but
I
think
from
this
on
I
shall
*NL*
have
no
need
of
any
prompting
,
and
I
shall
bring
my
true
story
safe
into
*NL*
port
,
and
here
it
is
.
The
king
my
father
,
who
was
called
Tinacrio
the
*NL*
Sapient
,
was
very
learned
in
what
they
call
magic
arts
,
and
became
aware
*NL*
by
his
craft
that
my
mother
,
who
was
called
Queen
Jaramilla
,
was
to
die
*NL*
before
he
did
,
and
that
soon
after
he
too
was
to
depart
this
life
,
and
I
*NL*
was
to
be
left
an
orphan
without
father
or
mother
.
But
all
this
,
he
*NL*
declared
,
did
not
so
much
grieve
or
distress
him
as
his
certain
knowledge
*NL*
that
a
prodigious
giant
,
the
lord
of
a
great
island
close
to
our
kingdom
,
*NL*
Pandafilando
of
the
Scowl
by
name
--
for
it
is
averred
that
,
though
his
*NL*
eyes
are
properly
placed
and
straight
,
he
always
looks
askew
as
if
he
*NL*
squinted
,
and
this
he
does
out
of
malignity
,
to
strike
fear
and
terror
*NL*
into
those
he
looks
at
--
that
he
knew
,
I
say
,
that
this
giant
on
becoming
*NL*
aware
of
my
orphan
condition
would
overrun
my
kingdom
with
a
mighty
force
*NL*
and
strip
me
of
all
,
not
leaving
me
even
a
small
village
to
shelter
me
;
*NL*
but
that
I
could
avoid
all
this
ruin
and
misfortune
if
I
were
willing
to
*NL*
marry
him
;
however
,
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
he
never
expected
that
I
*NL*
would
consent
to
a
marriage
so
unequal
;
and
he
said
no
more
than
the
*NL*
truth
in
this
,
for
it
has
never
entered
my
mind
to
marry
that
giant
,
or
*NL*
any
other
,
let
him
be
ever
so
great
or
enormous
.
My
father
said
,
too
,
*NL*
that
when
he
was
dead
,
and
I
saw
Pandafilando
about
to
invade
my
kingdom
,
*NL*
I
was
not
to
wait
and
attempt
to
defend
myself
,
for
that
would
be
*NL*
destructive
to
me
,
but
that
I
should
leave
the
kingdom
entirely
open
to
*NL*
him
if
I
wished
to
avoid
the
death
and
total
destruction
of
my
good
and
*NL*
loyal
vassals
,
for
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
defending
myself
*NL*
against
the
giant
's
devilish
power
;
and
that
I
should
at
once
with
some
*NL*
of
my
followers
set
out
for
Spain
,
where
I
should
obtain
relief
in
my
*NL*
distress
on
finding
a
certain
knight-errant
whose
fame
by
that
time
would
*NL*
extend
over
the
whole
kingdom
,
and
who
would
be
called
,
if
I
remember
*NL*
rightly
,
Don
Azote
or
Don
Gigote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Don
Quixote
,
'
he
must
have
said
,
senora
,
''
observed
Sancho
at
this
,
*NL*
``
otherwise
called
the
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
it
,
''
said
Dorothea
;
``
he
said
,
moreover
,
that
he
would
be
tall
of
*NL*
stature
and
lank
featured
;
and
that
on
his
right
side
under
the
left
*NL*
shoulder
,
or
thereabouts
,
he
would
have
a
grey
mole
with
hairs
like
*NL*
bristles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
,
Don
Quixote
said
to
his
squire
,
``
Here
,
Sancho
my
son
,
*NL*
bear
a
hand
and
help
me
to
strip
,
for
I
want
to
see
if
I
am
the
knight
*NL*
that
sage
king
foretold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
your
worship
want
to
strip
for
?
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
if
I
have
that
mole
your
father
spoke
of
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
occasion
to
strip
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
I
know
your
worship
*NL*
has
just
such
a
mole
on
the
middle
of
your
backbone
,
which
is
the
mark
of
*NL*
a
strong
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
enough
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
for
with
friends
we
must
not
look
too
*NL*
closely
into
trifles
;
and
whether
it
be
on
the
shoulder
or
on
the
*NL*
backbone
matters
little
;
it
is
enough
if
there
is
a
mole
,
be
it
where
it
*NL*
may
,
for
it
is
all
the
same
flesh
;
no
doubt
my
good
father
hit
the
truth
*NL*
in
every
particular
,
and
I
have
made
a
lucky
hit
in
commending
myself
to
*NL*
Don
Quixote
;
for
he
is
the
one
my
father
spoke
of
,
as
the
features
of
his
*NL*
countenance
correspond
with
those
assigned
to
this
knight
by
that
wide
*NL*
fame
he
has
acquired
not
only
in
Spain
but
in
all
La
Mancha
;
for
I
had
*NL*
scarcely
landed
at
Osuna
when
I
heard
such
accounts
of
his
achievements
,
*NL*
that
at
once
my
heart
told
me
he
was
the
very
one
I
had
come
in
search
*NL*
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
did
you
land
at
Osuna
,
senora
,
''
asked
Don
Quixote
,
``
when
it
is
*NL*
not
a
seaport
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
Dorothea
could
reply
the
curate
anticipated
her
,
saying
,
``
The
*NL*
princess
meant
to
say
that
after
she
had
landed
at
Malaga
the
first
place
*NL*
where
she
heard
of
your
worship
was
Osuna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
meant
to
say
,
''
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
would
be
only
natural
,
''
said
the
curate
.
``
Will
your
majesty
*NL*
please
proceed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
more
to
add
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
save
that
in
finding
Don
*NL*
Quixote
I
have
had
such
good
fortune
,
that
I
already
reckon
and
regard
*NL*
myself
queen
and
mistress
of
my
entire
dominions
,
since
of
his
courtesy
*NL*
and
magnanimity
he
has
granted
me
the
boon
of
accompanying
me
*NL*
whithersoever
I
may
conduct
him
,
which
will
be
only
to
bring
him
face
to
*NL*
face
with
Pandafilando
of
the
Scowl
,
that
he
may
slay
him
and
restore
to
*NL*
me
what
has
been
unjustly
usurped
by
him
:
for
all
this
must
come
to
pass
*NL*
satisfactorily
since
my
good
father
Tinacrio
the
Sapient
foretold
it
,
who
*NL*
likewise
left
it
declared
in
writing
in
Chaldee
or
Greek
characters
-LRB-
for
*NL*
I
can
not
read
them
-RRB-
,
that
if
this
predicted
knight
,
after
having
cut
the
*NL*
giant
's
throat
,
should
be
disposed
to
marry
me
I
was
to
offer
myself
at
*NL*
once
without
demur
as
his
lawful
wife
,
and
yield
him
possession
of
my
*NL*
kingdom
together
with
my
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
thinkest
thou
now
,
friend
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
.
*NL*
``
Hearest
thou
that
?
Did
I
not
tell
thee
so
?
See
how
we
have
already
got
a
*NL*
kingdom
to
govern
and
a
queen
to
marry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
oath
it
is
so
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
foul
fortune
to
him
who
wo
n't
*NL*
marry
after
slitting
Senor
Pandahilado
's
windpipe
!
And
then
,
how
*NL*
ill-favoured
the
queen
is
!
I
wish
the
fleas
in
my
bed
were
that
sort
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
saying
he
cut
a
couple
of
capers
in
the
air
with
every
sign
of
*NL*
extreme
satisfaction
,
and
then
ran
to
seize
the
bridle
of
Dorothea
's
*NL*
mule
,
and
checking
it
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
,
begging
her
to
give
*NL*
him
her
hand
to
kiss
in
token
of
his
acknowledgment
of
her
as
his
queen
*NL*
and
mistress
.
Which
of
the
bystanders
could
have
helped
laughing
to
see
*NL*
the
madness
of
the
master
and
the
simplicity
of
the
servant
?
Dorothea
*NL*
therefore
gave
her
hand
,
and
promised
to
make
him
a
great
lord
in
her
*NL*
kingdom
,
when
Heaven
should
be
so
good
as
to
permit
her
to
recover
and
*NL*
enjoy
it
,
for
which
Sancho
returned
thanks
in
words
that
set
them
all
*NL*
laughing
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
sirs
,
''
continued
Dorothea
,
``
is
my
story
;
it
only
remains
to
tell
*NL*
you
that
of
all
the
attendants
I
took
with
me
from
my
kingdom
I
have
none
*NL*
left
except
this
well-bearded
squire
,
for
all
were
drowned
in
a
great
*NL*
tempest
we
encountered
when
in
sight
of
port
;
and
he
and
I
came
to
land
*NL*
on
a
couple
of
planks
as
if
by
a
miracle
;
and
indeed
the
whole
course
of
*NL*
my
life
is
a
miracle
and
a
mystery
as
you
may
have
observed
;
and
if
I
*NL*
have
been
over
minute
in
any
respect
or
not
as
precise
as
I
ought
,
let
it
*NL*
be
accounted
for
by
what
the
licentiate
said
at
the
beginning
of
my
tale
,
*NL*
that
constant
and
excessive
troubles
deprive
the
sufferers
of
their
*NL*
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
shall
not
deprive
me
of
mine
,
exalted
and
worthy
princess
,
''
said
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
``
however
great
and
unexampled
those
which
I
shall
endure
in
*NL*
your
service
may
be
;
and
here
I
confirm
anew
the
boon
I
have
promised
*NL*
you
,
and
I
swear
to
go
with
you
to
the
end
of
the
world
until
I
find
*NL*
myself
in
the
presence
of
your
fierce
enemy
,
whose
haughty
head
I
trust
*NL*
by
the
aid
of
my
arm
to
cut
off
with
the
edge
of
this
--
I
will
not
say
*NL*
good
sword
,
thanks
to
Gines
de
Pasamonte
who
carried
away
mine
''
--
-LRB-
this
he
*NL*
said
between
his
teeth
,
and
then
continued
-RRB-
,
``
and
when
it
has
been
cut
*NL*
off

you
have
been
put

*NL*
be
left

your

dispose

may

pleasing

so
long
as
my
memory
is
occupied
,
my
will
enslaved
,
*NL*
and
my
understanding
enthralled
by
her-I
say
no
more
--
it
is
impossible
*NL*
for
me
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
marriage
,
even
with
a
Phoenix
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
of
his
master
about
not
wanting
to
marry
were
so
*NL*
disagreeable
to
Sancho
that
raising
his
voice
he
exclaimed
with
great
*NL*
irritation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
oath
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
you
are
not
in
your
right
senses
;
for
how
*NL*
can
your
worship
possibly
object
to
marrying
such
an
exalted
princess
as
*NL*
this
?
Do
you
think
Fortune
will
offer
you
behind
every
stone
such
a
piece
*NL*
of
luck
as
is
offered
you
now
?
Is
my
lady
Dulcinea
fairer
,
perchance
?
Not
*NL*
she
;
nor
half
as
fair
;
and
I
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
she
does
not
*NL*
come
up
to
the
shoe
of
this
one
here
.
A
poor
chance
I
have
of
getting
*NL*
that
county
I
am
waiting
for
if
your
worship
goes
looking
for
dainties
in
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
sea
.
In
the
devil
's
name
,
marry
,
marry
,
and
take
this
*NL*
kingdom
that
comes
to
hand
without
any
trouble
,
and
when
you
are
king
*NL*
make
me
a
marquis
or
governor
of
a
province
,
and
for
the
rest
let
the
*NL*
devil
take
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
when
he
heard
such
blasphemies
uttered
against
his
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
,
could
not
endure
it
,
and
lifting
his
pike
,
without
saying
*NL*
anything
to
Sancho
or
uttering
a
word
,
he
gave
him
two
such
thwacks
that
*NL*
he
brought
him
to
the
ground
;
and
had
it
not
been
that
Dorothea
cried
out
*NL*
to
him
to
spare
him
he
would
have
no
doubt
taken
his
life
on
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
''
he
said
to
him
after
a
pause
,
``
you
scurvy
clown
,
that
you
*NL*
are
to
be
always
interfering
with
me

and
that
you
are

be
always
*NL*
offending

I
always
pardoning

Do
n't
fancy
it
,
impious
scoundrel

for
*NL*
that
beyond
a
doubt
thou
art
,
since
thou
hast
set
thy
tongue
going
*NL*
against
the
peerless
Dulcinea

Know
you
not

lout

vagabond

beggar

*NL*
were
it
not

the
might
that
she
infuses
into
my

I
should
not
have
*NL*
strength
enough
to
kill
a
flea

Say
,
scoffer
with
a
viper
's
tongue

what
*NL*
think
you
has
won
this
kingdom
and
cut
off
this
giant

made
you
*NL*
a
marquis
-LRB-
for
all
this
I
count
as
already
accomplished

decided
-RRB-

*NL*
the
might
of
Dulcinea

employing
my
arm
as
the
instrument
of
her

achievements

She
fights
in
me

conquers
in
me
,
and
I
live
and
breathe
*NL*
in
her
,
and
owe
my
life

being
to
her
.
O
whoreson
scoundrel

how

ungrateful
you
are
,
you
see
yourself
raised
from
the
dust
of
the
earth
to
*NL*
be
a
titled
lord
,

the
return
you
make
for
so
great
a
benefit
is
to
*NL*
speak
evil
of
her
who
has
conferred
it
upon
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
not
so
stunned
but
that
he
heard
all
his
master
said
,
and
*NL*
rising
with
some
degree
of
nimbleness
he
ran
to
place
himself
behind
*NL*
Dorothea
's
palfrey
,
and
from
that
position
he
said
to
his
master
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
senor
;
if
your
worship
is
resolved
not
to
marry
this
great
*NL*
princess
,
it
is
plain
the
kingdom
will
not
be
yours
;
and
not
being
so
,
*NL*
how
can
you
bestow
favours
upon
me
?
That
is
what
I
complain
of
.
Let
your
*NL*
worship
at
any
rate
marry
this
queen
,
now
that
we
have
got
her
here
as
if
*NL*
showered
down
from
heaven
,
and
afterwards
you
may
go
back
to
my
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
;
for
there
must
have
been
kings
in
the
world
who
kept
*NL*
mistresses
.
As
to
beauty
,
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
;
and
if
the
truth
*NL*
is
to
be
told
,
I
like
them
both
;
though
I
have
never
seen
the
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
never
seen
her
,
blasphemous
traitor
!
''
exclaimed
Don
Quixote
;
``
hast
*NL*
thou
not
just
now
brought
me
a
message
from
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
I
did
not
see
her
so
much
at
my
leisure
that
*NL*
I
could
take
particular
notice
of
her
beauty
,
or
of
her
charms
piecemeal
;
*NL*
but
taken
in
the
lump
I
like
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
forgive
thee
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
do
thou
forgive
me
the
*NL*
injury
I
have
done
thee
;
for
our
first
impulses
are
not
in
our
control
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
see
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
and
with
me
the
wish
to
speak
is
always
*NL*
the
first
impulse
,
and
I
can
not
help
saying
,
once
at
any
rate
,
what
I
*NL*
have
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
take
heed
of
what
thou
sayest

*NL*
for
the
pitcher
goes
so
often
to
the
well

need
say
no
more
to
thee

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well
,

said
Sancho
,
``
God
is
in
heaven

and
sees
all
tricks

*NL*
will
judge
who
does
most
harm

I
in
not
speaking
right
,
or
your
worship
*NL*
in
not
doing
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
enough
,

said
Dorothea
;
``
run
,
Sancho
,
and
kiss
your
lord
's
hand
*NL*
and
beg
his
pardon
,
and
henceforward
be
more
circumspect
with
your
praise
*NL*
and
abuse
;
and
say
nothing
in
disparagement
of
that
lady
Toboso
,
of
whom
*NL*
I
know
nothing
save
that
I
am
her
servant
;
and
put
your
trust
in
God
,
for
*NL*
you
will
not
fail
to
obtain
some
dignity
so
as
to
live
like
a
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
advanced
hanging
his
head
and
begged
his
master
's
hand
,
which
Don
*NL*
Quixote
with
dignity
presented
to
him
,
giving
him
his
blessing
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
had
kissed
it
;
he
then
bade
him
go
on
ahead
a
little
,
as
he
had
*NL*
questions
to
ask
him
and
matters
of
great
importance
to
discuss
with
him
.
*NL*
Sancho
obeyed
,
and
when
the
two
had
gone
some
distance
in
advance
Don
*NL*
Quixote
said
to
him
,
``
Since
thy
return
I
have
had
no
opportunity
or
time
*NL*
to
ask
thee
many
particulars
touching
thy
mission
and
the
answer
thou
*NL*
hast
brought
back
,
and
now
that
chance
has
granted
us
the
time
and
*NL*
opportunity
,
deny
me
not
the
happiness
thou
canst
give
me
by
such
good
*NL*
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
your
worship
ask
what
you
will
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
for
I
shall
find
*NL*
a
way
out
of
all
as
as
I
found
a
way
in
;
but
I
implore
you
,
senor
,
not
*NL*
not
to
be
so
revengeful
in
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
dost
thou
say
that
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
it
,
''
he
returned
,
``
because
those
blows
just
now
were
more
because
*NL*
of
the
quarrel
the
devil
stirred
up
between
us
both
the
other
night
,
than
*NL*
for
what
I
said
against
my
lady
Dulcinea
,
whom
I
love
and
reverence
as
I
*NL*
would
a
relic
--
though
there
is
nothing
of
that
about
her
--
merely
as
*NL*
something
belonging
to
your
worship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no
more
on
that
subject
for
thy
life
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
``
for
it
is
displeasing
to
me
;
I
have
already
pardoned
thee
for
that
,
and
*NL*
thou
knowest
the
common
saying
,
`
for
a
fresh
sin
a
fresh
penance
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
going
on
they
saw
coming
along
the
road
they
were
*NL*
following
a
man
mounted
on
an
ass
,
who
when
he
came
close
seemed
to
be
a
*NL*
gipsy
;
but
Sancho
Panza
,
whose
eyes
and
heart
were
there
wherever
he
saw
*NL*
asses
,
no
sooner
beheld
the
man
than
he
knew
him
to
be
Gines
de
*NL*
Pasamonte
;
and
by
the
thread
of
the
gipsy
he
got
at
the
ball
,
his
ass
,
*NL*
for
it
was
,
in
fact
,
Dapple
that
carried
Pasamonte
,
who
to
escape
*NL*
recognition
and
to
sell
the
ass
had
disguised
himself
as
a
gipsy
,
being
*NL*
able
to
speak
the
gipsy
language
,
and
many
more
,
as
well
as
if
they
were
*NL*
his
own
.
Sancho
saw
him
and
recognised
him
,
and
the
instant
he
did
so
he
*NL*
shouted
to
him
,
``
Ginesillo
,
you
thief
,
give
up
my
treasure
,
release
my
*NL*
life
,
embarrass
thyself
not
with
my
repose
,
quit
my
ass
,
leave
my
*NL*
delight
,
be
off
,
rip
,
get
thee
gone
,
thief
,
and
give
up
what
is
not
*NL*
thine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
necessity
for
so
many
words
or
objurgations
,
for
at
the
*NL*
first
one
Gines
jumped
down
,
and
at
a
like
racing
speed
made
off
and
got
*NL*
clear
of
them
all
.
Sancho
hastened
to
his
Dapple
,
and
embracing
him
he
*NL*
said
,
``
How
hast
thou
fared
,
my
blessing
,
Dapple
of
my
eyes
,
my
comrade
?
''
*NL*
all
the
while
kissing
him
and
caressing
him
as
if
he
were
a
human
being
.
*NL*
The
ass
held
his
peace
,
and
let
himself
be
kissed
and
caressed
by
Sancho
*NL*
without
answering
a
single
word
.
They
all
came
up
and
congratulated
him
*NL*
on
having
found
Dapple
,
Don
Quixote
especially
,
who
told
him
that
*NL*
notwithstanding
this
he
would
not
cancel
the
order
for
the
three
*NL*
ass-colts
,
for
which
Sancho
thanked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
two
had
been
going
along
conversing
in
this
fashion
,
the
curate
*NL*
observed
to
Dorothea
that
she
had
shown
great
cleverness
,
as
well
in
the
*NL*
story
itself
as
in
its
conciseness
,
and
the
resemblance
it
bore
to
those
*NL*
of
the
books
of
chivalry
.
She
said
that
she
had
many
times
amused
herself
*NL*
reading
them
;
but
that
she
did
not
know
the
situation
of
the
provinces
or
*NL*
seaports
,
and
so
she
had
said
at
haphazard
that
she
had
landed
at
Osuna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
saw
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
and
for
that
reason
I
made
haste
to
say
*NL*
what
I
did
,
by
which
it
was
all
set
right
.
But
is
it
not
a
strange
thing
*NL*
to
see
how
readily
this
unhappy
gentleman
believes
all
these
figments
and
*NL*
lies
,
simply
because
they
are
in
the
style
and
manner
of
the
absurdities
*NL*
of
his
books
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
,
''
said
Cardenio
;
``
and
so
uncommon
and
unexampled
,
that
were
one
*NL*
to
attempt
to
invent
and
concoct
it
in
fiction
,
I
doubt
if
there
be
any
*NL*
wit
keen
enough
to
imagine
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
another
strange
thing
about
it
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
is
that
,
apart
*NL*
from
the
silly
things
which
this
worthy
gentleman
says
in
connection
with
*NL*
his
craze
,
when
other
subjects
are
dealt
with
,
he
can
discuss
them
in
a
*NL*
perfectly
rational
manner
,
showing
that
his
mind
is
quite
clear
and
*NL*
composed
;
so
that
,
provided
his
chivalry
is
not
touched
upon
,
no
one
*NL*
would
take
him
to
be
anything
but
a
man
of
thoroughly
sound
*NL*
understanding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
holding
this
conversation
Don
Quixote
continued
his
with
*NL*
Sancho
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
Panza
,
let
us
forgive
and
forget
as
to
our
quarrels
,
and
tell
me
*NL*
now
,
dismissing
anger
and
irritation
,
where
,
how
,
and
when
didst
thou
*NL*
find
Dulcinea
?
What
was
she
doing
?
What
didst
thou
say
to
her
?
What
did
*NL*
she
answer
?
How
did
she
look
when
she
was
reading
my
letter
?
Who
copied
*NL*
it
out
for
thee
?
and
everything
in
the
matter
that
seems
to
thee
worth
*NL*
knowing
,
asking
,
and
learning
;
neither
adding
nor
falsifying
to
give
me
*NL*
pleasure
,
nor
yet
curtailing
lest
you
should
deprive
me
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
if
the
truth
is
to
be
told
,
nobody
copied
out
*NL*
the
letter
for
me
,
for
I
carried
no
letter
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
thou
sayest
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
the
note-book
in
which
I
*NL*
wrote
it
I
found
in
my
own
possession
two
days
after
thy
departure
,
which
*NL*
gave
me
very
great
vexation
,
as
I
knew
not
what
thou
wouldst
do
on
*NL*
finding
thyself
without
any
letter
;
and
I
made
sure
thou
wouldst
return
*NL*
from
the
place
where
thou
didst
first
miss
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
should
have
done
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
if
I
had
not
got
it
by
heart
when
*NL*
your
worship
read
it
to
me
,
so
that
I
repeated
it
to
a
sacristan
,
who
*NL*
copied
it
out
for
me
from
hearing
it
,
so
exactly
that
he
said
in
all
the
*NL*
days
of
his
life
,
though
he
had
read
many
a
letter
of
excommunication
,
he
*NL*
had
never
seen
or
read
so
pretty
a
letter
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
hast
thou
got
it
still
in
thy
memory
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
for
as
soon
as
I
had
repeated
it
,
seeing
*NL*
there
was
no
further
use
for
it
,
I
set
about
forgetting
it
;
and
if
I
*NL*
recollect
any
of
it
,
it
is
that
about
`
Scrubbing
,
'
I
mean
to
say

Sovereign

and
the
end
`
Yours
till
death
,
the
Knight
of
the
Rueful
*NL*
Countenance

between
these
two
I
put
into
it
more

three
hundred

OF
THE
DELECTABLE
DISCUSSION
BETWEEN
DON
QUIXOTE
AND

PANZA

HIS
*NL*
SQUIRE

TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
INCIDENTS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
is
not
unsatisfactory
to
me
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
``
Go
on
;
thou
*NL*
didst
reach
her
;
and
what
was
that
queen
of
beauty
doing
?
Surely
thou
*NL*
didst
find
her
stringing
pearls
,
or
embroidering
some
device
in
gold
*NL*
thread
for
this
her
enslaved
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
I
found
her
winnowing
two
bushels
of
wheat
*NL*
in
the
yard
of
her
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
depend
upon
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
grains
of
that
wheat
were
*NL*
pearls
when
touched
by
her
hands
;
and
didst
thou
look
,
friend
?
was
it
*NL*
white
wheat
or
brown
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
neither
,
but
red
,

said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
promise
thee
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
,
winnowed
by
her
hands
,
*NL*
beyond
a
doubt
the
bread
it
made
was
of
the
whitest
;
but
go
on
;
when
thou
*NL*
gavest
her
my
letter
,
did
she
kiss
it
?
Did
she
place
it
on
her
head
?
Did
*NL*
she
perform
any
ceremony
befitting
it
,
or
what
did
she
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
went
to
give
it
to
her
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
she
was
hard
at
it
*NL*
swaying
from
side
to
side
with
a
lot
of
wheat
she
had
in
the
sieve
,
and
*NL*
she
said
to
me
,
`
Lay
the
letter
,
friend
,
on
the
top
of
that
sack
,
for
I
*NL*
can
not
read
it
until
I
have
done
sifting
all
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Discreet
lady
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
that
was
in
order
to
read
it
at
her
*NL*
leisure
and
enjoy
it
;
proceed
,
Sancho
;
while
she
was
engaged
in
her
*NL*
occupation
what
converse
did
she
hold
with
thee
?
What
did
she
ask
about
*NL*
me
,
and
what
answer
didst
thou
give
?
Make
haste
;
tell
me
all
,
and
let
not
*NL*
an
atom
be
left
behind
in
the
ink-bottle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
asked
me
nothing
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
I
told
her
how
your
worship
was
*NL*
left
doing
penance
in
her
service
,
naked
from
the
waist
up
,
in
among
*NL*
these
mountains
like
a
savage
,
sleeping
on
the
ground
,
not
eating
bread
*NL*
off
a
tablecloth
nor
combing
your
beard
,
weeping
and
cursing
your
*NL*
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
saying
I
cursed
my
fortune
thou
saidst
wrong
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
*NL*
rather
do
I
bless
it
and
shall
bless
it
all
the
days
of
my
life
for
*NL*
having
made
me
worthy
of
aspiring
to
love
so
lofty
a
lady
as
Dulcinea
del
*NL*
Toboso
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
lofty
she
is
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
she
overtops
me
by
more
than
a
*NL*
hand
's
-
breadth
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
didst
thou
measure
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
measured
in
this
way
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
going
to
help
her
to
put
a
sack
*NL*
of
wheat
on
the
back
of
an
ass
,
we
came
so
close
together
that
I
could
*NL*
see
she
stood
more
than
a
good
palm
over
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
doth
she
not
of
a
truth
accompany
and
*NL*
adorn
this
greatness
with
a
thousand
million
charms
of
mind
!
But
one
*NL*
thing
thou
wilt
not
deny
,
Sancho
;
when
thou
camest
close
to
her
didst
*NL*
thou
not
perceive
a
Sabaean
odour
,
an
aromatic
fragrance
,
a
,
I
know
not
*NL*
what
,
delicious
,
that
I
can
not
find
a
name
for
;
I
mean
a
redolence
,
an
*NL*
exhalation
,
as
if
thou
wert
in
the
shop
of
some
dainty
glover
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
can
say
is
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
I
did
perceive
a
little
odour
,
*NL*
something
goaty
;
it
must
have
been
that
she
was
all
in
a
sweat
with
hard
*NL*
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
could
not
be
that
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
thou
must
have
been
*NL*
suffering
from
cold
in
the
head
,
or
must
have
smelt
thyself
;
for
I
know
*NL*
well
what
would
be
the
scent
of
that
rose
among
thorns
,
that
lily
of
the
*NL*
field
,
that
dissolved
amber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
so
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
there
often
comes
from
myself
that
same
*NL*
odour
which
then
seemed
to
me
to
come
from
her
grace
the
lady
Dulcinea
;
*NL*
but
that
's
no
wonder
,
for
one
devil
is
like
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
continued
Don
Quixote
,
``
now
she
has
done
sifting
the
corn
*NL*
and
sent
it
to
the
mill
;
what
did
she
do
when
she
read
the
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
the
letter
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
she
did
not
read
it
,
for
she
said
she
*NL*
could
neither
read
nor
write
;
instead
of
that
she
tore
it
up
into
small
*NL*
pieces
,
saying
that
she
did
not
want
to
let
anyone
read
it
lest
her
*NL*
secrets
should
become
known
in
the
village
,
and
that
what
I
had
told
her
*NL*
by
word
of
mouth
about
the
love
your
worship
bore
her
,
and
the
*NL*
extraordinary
penance
you
were
doing
for
her
sake
,
was
enough
;
and
,
to
*NL*
make
an
end
of
it
,
she
told
me
to
tell
your
worship
that
she
kissed
your
*NL*
hands
,
and
that
she
had
a
greater
desire
to
see
you
than
to
write
to
you
;
*NL*
and
that
therefore
she
entreated
and
commanded
you
,
on
sight
of
this
*NL*
present
,
to
come
out
of
these
thickets
,
and
to
have
done
with
carrying
on
*NL*
absurdities
,
and
to
set
out
at
once
for
El
Toboso
,
unless
something
else
*NL*
of
greater
importance
should
happen
,
for
she
had
a
great
desire
to
see
*NL*
your
worship
.
She
laughed
greatly
when
I
told
her
how
your
worship
was
*NL*
called
The
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
;
I
asked
her
if
that
Biscayan
*NL*
the
other
day
had
been
there
;
and
she
told
me
he
had
,
and
that
he
was
an
*NL*
honest
fellow
;
I
asked
her
too
about
the
galley
slaves
,
but
she
said
she
*NL*
had
not
seen
any
as
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
all
goes
well
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
tell
me
what
jewel
was
it
*NL*
that
she
gave
thee
on
taking
thy
leave
,
in
return
for
thy
tidings
of
me
?
*NL*
For
it
is
a
usual
and
ancient
custom
with
knights
and
ladies
errant
to
*NL*
give
the
squires
,
damsels
,
or
dwarfs
who
bring
tidings
of
their
ladies
to
*NL*
the
knights
,
or
of
their
knights
to
the
ladies
,
some
rich
jewel
as
a
*NL*
guerdon
for
good
news
,
'
and
acknowledgment
of
the
message
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
likely
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
a
good
custom
it
was
,
to
my
*NL*
mind
;
but
that
must
have
been
in
days
gone
by
,
for
now
it
would
seem
to
*NL*
be
the
custom
only
to
give
a
piece
of
bread
and
cheese
;
because
that
was
*NL*
what
my
lady
Dulcinea
gave
me
over
the
top
of
the
yard-wall
when
I
took
*NL*
leave
of
her
;
and
more
by
token
it
was
sheep
's
-
milk
cheese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
generous
in
the
extreme
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
if
she
did
not
*NL*
give
thee
a
jewel
of
gold
,
no
doubt
it
must
have
been
because
she
had
not
*NL*
one
to
hand
there
to
give
thee
;
but
sleeves
are
good
after
Easter
;
I
*NL*
shall
see
her
and
all
shall
be
made
right
.
But
knowest
thou
what
amazes
*NL*
me
,
Sancho
?
It
seems
to
me
thou
must
have
gone
and
come
through
the
air
,
*NL*
for
thou
hast
taken
but
little
more
than
three
days
to
go
to
El
Toboso
*NL*
and
return
,
though
it
is
more
than
thirty
leagues
from
here
to
there
.
*NL*
From
which
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
sage
magician
who
is
my
*NL*
friend
,
and
watches
over
my
interests
-LRB-
for
of
necessity
there
is
and
must
*NL*
be
one
,
or
else
I
should
not
be
a
right
knight-errant
-RRB-
,
that
this
same
,
I
*NL*
say
,
must
have
helped
thee
to
travel
without
thy
knowledge
;
for
some
of
*NL*
these
sages
will
catch
up
a
knight-errant
sleeping
in
his
bed
,
and
*NL*
without
his
knowing
how
or
in
what
way
it
happened
,
he
wakes
up
the
next
*NL*
day
more
than
a
thousand
leagues
away
from
the
place
where
he
went
to
*NL*
sleep
.
And
if
it
were
not
for
this
,
knights-errant
would
not
be
able
to
*NL*
give
aid
to
one
another
in
peril
,
as
they
do
at
every
turn
.
For
a
knight
,
*NL*
maybe
,
is
fighting
in
the
mountains
of
Armenia
with
some
dragon
,
or
*NL*
fierce
serpent
,
or
another
knight
,
and
gets
the
worst
of
the
battle
,
and
*NL*
is
at
the
point
of
death
;
but
when
he
least
looks
for
it
,
there
appears
*NL*
over
against
him
on
a
cloud
,
or
chariot
of
fire
,
another
knight
,
a
friend
*NL*
of
his
,
who
just
before
had
been
in
England
,
and
who
takes
his
part
,
and
*NL*
delivers
him
from
death
;
and
at
night
he
finds
himself
in
his
own
*NL*
quarters
supping
very
much
to
his
satisfaction
;
and
yet
from
one
place
to
*NL*
the
other
will
have
been
two
or
three
thousand
leagues
.
And
all
this
is
*NL*
done
by
the
craft
and
skill
of
the
sage
enchanters
who
take
care
of
those
*NL*
valiant
knights
;
so
that
,
friend
Sancho
,
I
find
no
difficulty
in
*NL*
believing
that
thou
mayest
have
gone
from
this
place
to
El
Toboso
and
*NL*
returned
in
such
a
short
time
,
since
,
as
I
have
said
,
some
friendly
sage
*NL*
must
have
carried
thee
through
the
air
without
thee
perceiving
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
have
been
it
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
indeed
Rocinante
went
like
a
*NL*
gipsy
's
ass
with
quicksilver
in
his
ears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quicksilver
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
aye
and
what
is
more
,
a
legion
of
*NL*
devils
,
folk
that
can
travel
and
make
others
travel
without
being
weary
,
*NL*
exactly
as
the
whim
seizes
them
.
But
putting
this
aside
,
what
thinkest
*NL*
thou
I
ought
to
do
about
my
lady
's
command
to
go
and
see
her
?
For
though
*NL*
I
feel
that
I
am
bound
to
obey
her
mandate
,
I
feel
too
that
I
am
debarred
*NL*
by
the
boon
I
have
accorded
to
the
princess
that
accompanies
us
,
and
the
*NL*
law
of
chivalry
compels
me
to
have
regard
for
my
word
in
preference
to
my
*NL*
inclination
;
on
the
one
hand
the
desire
to
see
my
lady
pursues
and
*NL*
harasses
me
,
on
the
other
my
solemn
promise
and
the
glory
I
shall
win
in

this

call
me

what
I
think
I
shall
do
is
to
*NL*
travel
with
all
speed
and
reach
quickly
the
place
where
this
giant
is
,
*NL*
and
on
my
arrival
I
shall
cut
off
his
head
,
and
establish
the
princess
*NL*
peacefully
in
her
realm
,
and
forthwith
I
shall
return
to
behold
the
light
*NL*
that
lightens
my
senses
,
to
whom
I
shall
make
such
excuses
that
she
will
*NL*
be
led
to
approve
of
my
delay
,
for
she
will
see
that
it
entirely
tends
to
*NL*
increase
her
glory
and
fame
;
for
all
that
I
have
won
,
am
winning
,
or
*NL*
shall
win
by
arms
in
this
life
,
comes
to
me
of
the
favour
she
extends
to
*NL*
me
,
and
because
I
am
hers
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
what
a
sad
state
your
worship
's
brains
are
in
!
''
said
Sancho
.
``
Tell
*NL*
me
,
senor
,
do
you
mean
to
travel
all
that
way
for
nothing
,
and
to
let
*NL*
slip
and
lose
so
rich
and
great
a
match
as
this
where
they
give
as
a
*NL*
portion
a
kingdom
that
in
sober
truth
I
have
heard
say
is
more
than
*NL*
twenty
thousand
leagues
round
about

abounds
with
all
things
*NL*
necessary

support
human

Blush
for
what
you
have
said

take
my

forgive
me

marry
at
once

there
is
a

is
our
licentiate

will
*NL*
do
the

beautifully

remember
,
I
am
old
enough

give
advice

this
I
am
giving
comes
pat
to
the
purpose

for
a
sparrow
in
the
hand
*NL*
is
better
than
a
vulture
on
the
wing
,

he
who
has
the
good
to
his

*NL*

chooses
the
bad
,
that
the
good
he
complains
of
may
not
come
to
him

*NL*
``
Look
here

Sancho

Don
Quixote

``
If
thou
art
advising

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

plain
speaking

Sancho

like

I
may
be
*NL*
able

ship
off

finish
off

are
with

about
what
we

Dulcinea
is
so
decorous

not

makes
all

overcome

being
the

are
her
lover

And
as
those
who
go
must
perforce
*NL*
kneel
before
her

say
they
come
from
your

submit
themselves

of
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
O

simple
thou
art

said
Don
Quixote
;
``
seest
thou
not
,
*NL*
Sancho

that
this
tends
to
her
greater
exaltation

For
thou
must
know

that
according
to
our
way
of
thinking
in
chivalry
,
it
is
a
high
honour
to
*NL*
a
lady
to
have
many
knights-errant
in
her
service
,
whose
thoughts
never
*NL*
go
beyond
serving
her
for
her
own
sake

who
look
for
no
other
reward

their
great
and
true
devotion

that

should
be
willing

*NL*
accept
them

her
knights

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
with
that
kind
of
love

said
Sancho
,
``
I
have
heard
preachers
say
*NL*
we
ought
to
love

Lord

for
himself
alone

without
being
moved
by
the
*NL*
hope
of
glory

the
fear

for

part

I
would
*NL*
rather
love

for
what
he
could
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

said
Don

shrewd
*NL*
things
thou
sayest
at
times

One
would
think

studied

*NL*
``
In

then

I

not

*NL*
*NL*
Master
Nicholas
here
called
out
to
them
to
wait
a
while
,
as
they
wanted
*NL*
to
halt
and
drink
at
a
little
spring
there
was
there
.
Don
Quixote
drew
*NL*
up
,
not
a
little
to
the
satisfaction
of
Sancho
,
for
he
was
by
this
time
*NL*
weary
of
telling
so
many
lies
,
and
in
dread
of
his
master
catching
him
*NL*
tripping
,
for
though
he
knew
that
Dulcinea
was
a
peasant
girl
of
El
*NL*
Toboso
,
he
had
never
seen
her
in
all
his
life
.
Cardenio
had
now
put
on
*NL*
the
clothes
which
Dorothea
was
wearing
when
they
found
her
,
and
though
*NL*
they
were
not
very
good
,
they
were
far
better
than
those
he
put
off
.
They
*NL*
dismounted
together
by
the
side
of
the
spring
,
and
with
what
the
curate
*NL*
had
provided
himself
with
at
the
inn
they
appeased
,
though
not
very
well
,
*NL*
the
keen
appetite
they
all
of
them
brought
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
so
employed
there
happened
to
come
by
a
youth
passing
on
*NL*
his
way
,
who
stopping
to
examine
the
party
at
the
spring
,
the
next
moment
*NL*
ran
to
Don
Quixote
and
clasping
him
round
the
legs
,
began
to
weep
freely
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
O
,
senor
,
do
you
not
know
me
?
Look
at
me
well
;
I
am
that
lad
*NL*
Andres
that
your
worship
released
from
the
oak-tree
where
I
was
tied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
recognised
him
,
and
taking
his
hand
he
turned
to
those
*NL*
present
and
said
:
``
That
your
worships
may
see
how
important
it
is
to
have
*NL*
knights-errant
to
redress
the
wrongs
and
injuries
done
by
tyrannical
and
*NL*
wicked
men
in
this
world
,
I
may
tell
you
that
some
days
ago
passing
*NL*
through
a
wood
,
I
heard
cries
and
piteous
complaints
as
of
a
person
in
*NL*
pain
and
distress
;
I
immediately
hastened
,
impelled
by
my
bounden
duty
,
*NL*
to
the
quarter
whence
the
plaintive
accents
seemed
to
me
to
proceed
,
and
*NL*
I
found
tied
to
an
oak
this
lad
who
now
stands
before
you
,
which
in
my
*NL*
heart
I
rejoice
at
,
for
his
testimony
will
not
permit
me
to
depart
from
*NL*
the
truth
in
any
particular
.
He
was
,
I
say
,
tied
to
an
oak
,
naked
from
*NL*
the
waist
up
,
and
a
clown
,
whom
I
afterwards
found
to
be
his
master
,
was
*NL*
scarifying
him
by
lashes
with
the
reins
of
his
mare
.
As
soon
as
I
saw
him
*NL*
I
asked
the
reason
of
so
cruel
a
flagellation
.
The
boor
replied
that
he
*NL*
was
flogging
him
because
he
was
his
servant
and
because
of
carelessness
*NL*
that
proceeded
rather
from
dishonesty
than
stupidity
;
on
which
this
boy
*NL*
said
,
`
Senor
,
he
flogs
me
only
because
I
ask
for
my
wages
.
'
The
master
*NL*
made
I
know
not
what
speeches
and
explanations
,
which
,
though
I
listened
*NL*
to
them
,
I
did
not
accept
.
In
short
,
I
compelled
the
clown
to
unbind
him
,
*NL*
and
to
swear
he
would
take
him
with
him
,
and
pay
him
real
by
real
,
and
*NL*
perfumed
into
the
bargain
.
Is
not
all
this
true
,
Andres
my
son
?
Didst
*NL*
thou
not
mark
with
what
authority
I
commanded
him
,
and
with
what
humility
*NL*
he
promised
to
do
all
I
enjoined
,
specified
,
and
required
of
him
?
Answer
*NL*
without
hesitation
;
tell
these
gentlemen
what
took
place
,
that
they
may
*NL*
see
that
it
is
as
great
an
advantage
as
I
say
to
have
knights-errant
*NL*
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
your
worship
has
said
is
quite
true
,
''
answered
the
lad
;
``
but
*NL*
the
end
of
the
business
turned
out
just
the
opposite
of
what
your
worship
*NL*
supposes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
the
opposite
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
did
not
the
clown
pay
thee
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
only
did
he
not
pay
me
,
''
replied
the
lad
,
``
but
as
soon
as
your
*NL*
worship
had
passed
out
of
the
wood
and
we
were
alone
,
he
tied
me
up
again
*NL*
to
the
same
oak
and
gave
me
a
fresh
flogging
,
that
left
me
like
a
flayed
*NL*
Saint
Bartholomew
;
and
every
stroke
he
gave
me
he
followed
up
with
some
*NL*
jest
or
gibe
about
having
made
a
fool
of
your
worship
,
and
but
for
the
*NL*
pain
I
was
suffering
I
should
have
laughed
at
the
things
he
said
.
In
*NL*
short
he
left
me
in
such
a
condition
that
I
have
been
until
now
in
a
*NL*
hospital
getting
cured
of
the
injuries
which
that
rascally
clown
*NL*
inflicted
on
me
then
;
for
all
which
your
worship
is
to
blame
;
for
if
you
*NL*
had
gone
your
own
way
and
not
come
where
there
was
no
call
for
you
,
nor
*NL*
meddled
in
other
people
's
affairs
,
my
master
would
have
been
content
with
*NL*
giving
me
one
or
two
dozen
lashes
,
and
would
have
then
loosed
me
and
paid
*NL*
me
what
he
owed
me
;
but
when
your
worship
abused
him
so
out
of
measure
,
*NL*
and
gave
him
so
many
hard
words
,
his
anger
was
kindled
;
and
as
he
could
*NL*
not
revenge
himself
on
you
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
you
had
left
him
the
storm
*NL*
burst
upon
me
in
such
a
way
,
that
I
feel
as
if
I
should
never
be
a
man
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mischief
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
lay
in
my
going
away
;
for
I
should
not
*NL*
have
gone
until
I
had
seen
thee
paid
;
because
I
ought
to
have
known
well
*NL*
by
long
experience
that
there
is
no
clown
who
will
keep
his
word
if
he
*NL*
finds
it
will
not
suit
him
to
keep
it
;
but
thou
rememberest
,
Andres
,
that
*NL*
I
swore
if
he
did
not
pay
thee
I
would
go
and
seek
him
,
and
find
him
*NL*
though
he
were
to
hide
himself
in
the
whale
's
belly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Andres
;
``
but
it
was
of
no
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
shalt
see
now
whether
it
is
of
use
or
not

said
Don
Quixote
;
and
*NL*
so
saying
,
he
got
up
hastily
and
bade
Sancho
bridle
Rocinante
,
who
was
*NL*
browsing
while
they
were
eating
.
Dorothea
asked
him
what
he
meant
to
do
.
*NL*
He
replied
that
he
meant
to
go
in
search
of
this
clown
and
chastise
him
*NL*
for
such
iniquitous
conduct
,
and
see
Andres
paid
to
the
last
maravedi
,
*NL*
despite
and
in
the
teeth
of
all
the
clowns
in
the
world
.
To
which
she
*NL*
replied
that
he
must
remember
that
in
accordance
with
his
promise
he
*NL*
could
not
engage
in
any
enterprise
until
he
had
concluded
hers
;
and
that
*NL*
as
he
knew
this
better
than
anyone
,
he
should
restrain
his
ardour
until
*NL*
his
return
from
her
kingdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
Andres
must
have
patience
until
my
*NL*
return
as
you
say
,
senora
;
but
I
once
more
swear
and
promise
not
to
stop
*NL*
until
I
have
seen
him
avenged
and
paid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
faith
in
those
oaths
,
''
said
Andres
;
``
I
would
rather
have
now
*NL*
something
to
help
me
to
get
to
Seville

all
the
revenges

*NL*
world
;
if
you
have
here
anything
to
eat
that
I
can
take
with
me

give
it

me

God
be
with
your

all

may
their

errands
turn
out
as
well
for
themselves

they
have
for

*NL*
Sancho
took
out
from
his
store
a
piece
of
bread
and
another
of
cheese
,
*NL*
and
giving
them
to
the
lad
he
said
,
``
Here

Sancho

Andres
seized
his
bread
and
cheese
,
and
seeing
that
nobody
gave
him
*NL*
anything
more
,
bent
his
head
,
and
took
hold
of
the
road
,
as
the
saying
*NL*
is

However
,
before
leaving
he
said
,
``
For

Don
Quixote
was
getting
up
to
chastise
him
,
but
he
took
to
his
heels
at
*NL*
such
a
pace
that
no
one
attempted
to
follow
him
;
and
mightily
chapfallen
*NL*
was
Don
Quixote
at
Andres

story
,
and
the
others
had
to
take
great
care
*NL*
to
restrain
their
laughter
so

not

put

CHAPTER
XXXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
WHAT
BEFELL
DON
QUIXOTE
'S
PARTY
AT
THE
INN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Their
dainty
repast
being
finished
,
they
saddled
at
once
,
and
without
any
*NL*
adventure
worth
mentioning
they
reached
next
day
the
inn
,
the
object
of
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
's
fear
and
dread
;
but
though
he
would
have
rather
not
*NL*
entered
it
,
there
was
no
help
for
it
.
The
landlady
,
the
landlord
,
their
*NL*
daughter
,
and
Maritornes
,
when
they
saw
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
coming
,
*NL*
went
out
to
welcome
them
with
signs
of
hearty
satisfaction
,
which
Don
*NL*
Quixote
received
with
dignity
and
gravity
,
and
bade
them
make
up
a
better
*NL*
bed
for
him
than
the
last
time
:
to
which
the
landlady
replied
that
if
he
*NL*
paid
better
than
he
did
the
last
time
she
would
give
him
one
fit
for
a
*NL*
prince
.
Don
Quixote
said
he
would
,
so
they
made
up
a
tolerable
one
for
*NL*
him
in
the
same
garret
as
before
;
and
he
lay
down
at
once
,
being
sorely
*NL*
shaken
and
in
want
of
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
was
the
door
shut
upon
him
than
the
landlady
made
at
the
*NL*
barber
,
and
seizing
him
by
the
beard
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
faith
you
are
not
going
to
make
a
beard
of
my
tail
any
longer
;
you
*NL*
must
give
me
back
tail
,
for
it
is
a
shame
the
way
that
thing
of
my
*NL*
husband
's
goes
tossing
about
on
the
floor
;
I
mean
the
comb
that
I
used
to
*NL*
stick
in
my
good
tail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
all
she
tugged
at
it
the
barber
would
not
give
it
up
until
the
*NL*
licentiate
told
him
to
let
her
have
it
,
as
there
was
now
no
further
*NL*
occasion
for
that
stratagem
,
because
he
might
declare
himself
and
appear
*NL*
in
his
own
character
,
and
tell
Don
Quixote
that
he
had
fled
to
this
inn
*NL*
when
those
thieves
the
galley
slaves
robbed
him
;
and
should
he
ask
for
*NL*
the
princess
's
squire
,
they
could
tell
him
that
she
had
sent
him
on
*NL*
before
her
to
give
notice
to
the
people
of
her
kingdom
that
she
was
*NL*
coming
,
and
bringing
with
her
the
deliverer
of
them
all
.
On
this
the
*NL*
barber
cheerfully
restored
the
tail
to
the
landlady
,
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
they
returned
all
the
accessories
they
had
borrowed
to
effect
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
deliverance
.
All
the
people
of
the
inn
were
struck
with
*NL*
astonishment
at
the
beauty
of
Dorothea
,
and
even
at
the
comely
figure
of
*NL*
the
shepherd
Cardenio
.
The
curate
made
them
get
ready
such
fare
as
there
*NL*
was
in
the
inn
,
and
the
landlord
,
in
hope
of
better
payment
,
served
them
*NL*
up
a
tolerably
good
dinner
.
All
this
time
Don
Quixote
was
asleep
,
and
*NL*
they
thought
it
best
not
to
waken
him
,
as
sleeping
would
now
do
him
more
*NL*
good
than
eating
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
at
dinner
,
the
company
consisting
of
the
landlord
,
his
wife
,
their
*NL*
daughter
,
Maritornes
,
and
all
the
travellers
,
they
discussed
the
strange
*NL*
craze
of
Don
Quixote
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
found
;
and
the
*NL*
landlady
told
them
what
had
taken
place
between
him
and
the
carrier
;
and
*NL*
then
,
looking
round
to
see
if
Sancho
was
there
,
when
she
saw
he
was
not
,
*NL*
she
gave
them
the
whole
story
of
his
blanketing
,
which
they
received
with
*NL*
no
little
amusement
.
But
on
the
curate
observing
that
it
was
the
books
of
*NL*
chivalry
which
Don
Quixote
had
read
that
had
turned
his
brain
,
the
*NL*
landlord
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
understand
how
that
can
be
,
for
in
truth
to
my
mind
there
is
no
*NL*
better
reading
in
the
world
,
and
I
have
here
two
or
three
of
them
,
with
*NL*
other
writings
that
are
the
very
life
,
not
only
of
myself
but
of
plenty
*NL*
more
;
for
when
it
is
harvest-time
,
the
reapers
flock
here
on
holidays
,
*NL*
and
there
is
always
one
among
them
who
can
read
and
who
takes
up
one
of
*NL*
these
books
,
and
we
gather
round
him
,
thirty
or
more
of
us
,
and
stay
*NL*
listening
to
him
with
a
delight
that
makes
our
grey
hairs
grow
young
*NL*
again
.
At
least
I
can
say
for
myself
that
when
I
hear
of
what
furious
and
*NL*
terrible
blows
the
knights
deliver
,
I
am
seized
with
the
longing
to
do
*NL*
the
same
,
and
I
would
like
to
be
hearing
about
them
night
and
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
just
as
much
,
''
said
the
landlady
,
``
because
I
never
have
a
quiet
*NL*
moment
in
my
house
except
when
you
are
listening
to
some
one
reading
;
for
*NL*
then
you
are
so
taken
up
that
for
the
time
being
you
forget
to
scold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Maritornes
;
``
and
,
faith
,
I
relish
hearing
these
*NL*
things
greatly
too
,
for
they
are
very
pretty
;
especially
when
they
*NL*
describe
some
lady
or
another
in
the
arms
of
her
knight
under
the
orange
*NL*
trees
,
and
the
duenna
who
is
keeping
watch
for
them
half
dead
with
envy
*NL*
and
fright
;
all
this
I
say
is
as
good
as
honey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
what
do
you
think
,
young
lady
?
''
said
the
curate
turning
to
the
*NL*
landlord
's
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
indeed
,
senor
,
''
said
she
;
``
I
listen
too
,
and
to
tell
the
*NL*
truth
,
though
I
do
not
understand
it
,
I
like
hearing
it
;
but
it
is
not
*NL*
the
blows
that
my
father
likes
that
I
like
,
but
the
laments
the
knights
*NL*
utter
when
they
are
separated
from
their
ladies
;
and
indeed
they
*NL*
sometimes
make
me
weep
with
the
pity
I
feel
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
would
console
them
if
it
was
for
you
they
wept
,
young
lady
?

*NL*
said
Dorothea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
do
,
''
said
the
girl
;
``
I
only
know
that
there
*NL*
are
some
of
those
ladies
so
cruel
that
they
call
their
knights
tigers
and
*NL*
lions
and
a
thousand
other
foul
names
:
and
Jesus
!
I
do
n't
know
what
sort
*NL*
of
folk
they
can
be
,
so
unfeeling
and
heartless
,
that
rather
than
bestow
*NL*
a
glance
upon
a
worthy
man

leave
him
to
die

go
mad

I
do
n't
know

good
of
such
prudery

it
is
for
honour

marry

That
's
all
they
want

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
child
,

said
the
landlady
;
``
it
seems
to
me
thou
knowest
a
great
*NL*
deal
about
these
things

it
is
not
fit

girls
to
know

talk
so
*NL*
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the
gentleman
asked
me
,
I
could
not
help
answering
him
,

said
the
*NL*
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then

said
the
curate
,
``
bring
me
these
books

I
should
like
to
see
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
said
he
,
and
going
into
his
own
room
he
brought
out
*NL*
an
old
valise
secured
with
a
little
chain
,
on
opening
which
the
curate
*NL*
found
in
it
three
large
books
and
some
manuscripts
written
in
a
very
good
*NL*
hand
.
The
first
that
he
opened
he
found
to
be
``
Don
Cirongilio
of
Thrace
,
''
*NL*
and
the
second
``
Don
Felixmarte
of
Hircania

the

When
the
curate
read
the
two
first
titles
he
looked
over
at
the
barber
*NL*
and
said
,
``

want

niece
here
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

the

,
``
I
can
do
just
as
well

yard

a
very
good
fire
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

said
the

*NL*
``

``

*NL*
``
Are

*NL*
``

that
about

burnt
than

*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother

the
curate
,
``
those
two
books
are
made
up
of
lies

and
are
*NL*
full
of
folly
and
nonsense
;
but
this
of
the
Great
Captain
is
a
true
*NL*
history
,
and
contains
the
deeds
of
Gonzalo
Hernandez
of
Cordova
,
who
by
*NL*
his
many
and
great
achievements
earned
the
title
all
over
the
world
of
*NL*
the
Great
Captain
,
a
famous
and
illustrious
name
,
and
deserved
by
him
*NL*
alone
;
and
this
Diego
Garcia
de
Paredes
was
a
distinguished
knight
of
the
*NL*
city
of
Trujillo
in
Estremadura
,
a
most
gallant
soldier
,
and
of
such
*NL*
bodily
strength
that
with
one
finger
he
stopped
a
mill-wheel
in
full
*NL*
motion
;
and
posted
with
a
two-handed
sword
at
the
foot
of
a
bridge
he
*NL*
kept
the
whole
of
an
immense
army
from
passing
over
it

achieved
such
*NL*
other
exploits

if
,
instead
of
his
relating
them
himself
with
the
*NL*
modesty
of
a
knight
and
of
one
writing
his
own
history
,
some
free
and
*NL*
unbiassed
writer
had
recorded
them
,
they
would
have
thrown
into
the
shade
*NL*
all
the
deeds
of
the
Hectors

Achilleses
,
and
Rolands
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
that
to
my

said
the
landlord
.
``
There
's
a
thing
to
be

astonished
at

Stopping
a
mill-wheel

By
God
your
worship
should
read
*NL*
what
I
have
read
of
Felixmarte
of
Hircania
,
how
with
one
single
*NL*
backstroke
he
cleft
five
giants
asunder
through
the
middle
as
if
they
had
*NL*
been
made
of
bean-pods
like
the
little
friars
the
children
make
;
and
*NL*
another
time
he
attacked
a
very
great
and
powerful
army
,
in
which
there
*NL*
were
more
than
a
million
six
hundred
thousand
soldiers
,
all
armed
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
,
and
he
routed
them
all
as
if
they
had
been
flocks
of
sheep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
what
do
you
say
to
the
good
Cirongilio
of
Thrace
,
that
was
so
*NL*
stout
and
bold
;
as
may
be
seen
in
the
book
,
where
it
is
related
that
as
*NL*
he
was
sailing
along
a
river
there
came
up
out
of
the
midst
of
the
water
*NL*
against
him
a
fiery
serpent
,
and
he
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
,
flung
himself
*NL*
upon
it
and
got
astride
of
its
scaly
shoulders
,
and
squeezed
its
throat
*NL*
with
both
hands
with
such
force
that
the
serpent
,
finding
he
was
*NL*
throttling
it
,
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
let
itself
sink
to
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
river
,
carrying
with
it
the
knight
who
would
not
let
go
his
hold
;
and
*NL*
when
they
got
down
there
he
found
himself
among
palaces
and
gardens
so
*NL*
pretty
that
it
was
a
wonder
to
see
;
and
then
the
serpent
changed
itself
*NL*
into
an
old
ancient
man
,
who
told
him
such
things
as
were
never
heard
.
*NL*
Hold
your
peace
,
senor
;
for
if
you
were
to
hear
this
you
would
go
mad
*NL*
with
delight

A
couple
of
figs
for
your
Great
Captain

your
Diego
*NL*
Garcia

*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
Dorothea
said
in
a
whisper
to
Cardenio
,
``
Our
landlord
is
*NL*
almost
fit

play
a
second
part

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so

said
Cardenio
,

for

as
he
shows

he
accepts
it
as
a
*NL*
certainty
that
everything
those

relate
took
place
exactly
as
it
is
*NL*
written
down

the
barefooted

themselves
would
not

contrary

``
But
consider

said
the
curate
once
more

,
that
the
books
of
chivalry
talk
*NL*
of
;
the
whole
thing
is
the
fabrication
and
invention
of
idle
wits
,
*NL*
devised
by
them
for
the
purpose
you
describe
of
beguiling
the
time
,
as
*NL*
your
reapers
do
when
they
read
;
for
I
swear
to
you
in
all
seriousness
*NL*
there
never
were
any
such
knights
in
the
world
,
and
no
such
exploits
or
*NL*
nonsense
ever
happened
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
that
bone
on
another
dog
,
''
said
the
landlord
;
``
as
if
I
did
not
know
*NL*
how
many
make
five
,
and
where
my
shoe
pinches
me
;
do
n't
think
to
feed
me
*NL*
with
pap
,
for
by
God
I
am
no
fool
.
It
is
a
good
joke
for
your
worship
to
*NL*
try
and
persuade
me
that
everything
these
good
books
say
is
nonsense
and
*NL*
lies
,
and
they
printed
by
the
license
of
the
Lords
of
the
Royal
Council
,
*NL*
as
if
they
were
people
who
would
allow
such
a
lot
of
lies
to
be
printed
*NL*
all
together
,
and
so
many
battles
and
enchantments
that
they
take
away
*NL*
one
's
senses
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
,
friend
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
that
this
is
done
to
divert
*NL*
our
idle
thoughts
;
and
as
in
well-ordered
states
games
of
chess

fives

*NL*

billiards
are
allowed
for
the
diversion
of
those
who
do
not
care
,

*NL*
are
not
obliged
,
or
are
unable

so
books
of
this
kind
are
allowed
*NL*
to

on
the
supposition

what
indeed
is
the
truth

there
*NL*
can
be

if
*NL*
it
were
permitted
me
now
,

the

desired
it

I
could
say
*NL*
something
about
the
qualities
books

should
possess

be
good

that
would
be
to
the
advantage

to
the

believe

what

have
said

take
your
books

make
up
your

about
their
*NL*
truth

falsehood

much
good
may
they
do
you
;

God
grant
you
may
*NL*
not
fall
lame
of
the

foot
your

Don
Quixote
halts
on
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
fear
of
that
,
''
returned
the
landlord
;
``
I
shall
not
be
so
mad
as
to
*NL*
make
a
knight-errant
of
myself
;
for
I
see
well
enough
that
things
are
not
*NL*
now
as
they
used
to
be
in
those
days
,
when
they
say
those
famous
knights
*NL*
roamed
about
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
had
made
his
appearance
in
the
middle
of
this
conversation
,
and
he
*NL*
was
very
much
troubled
and
cast
down
by
what
he
heard
said
about
*NL*
knights-errant
being
now
no
longer
in
vogue
,
and
all
books
of
chivalry
*NL*
being
folly
and
lies
;
and
he
resolved
in
his
heart
to
wait
and
see
what
*NL*
came
of
this
journey
of
his
master
's
,
and
if
it
did
not
turn
out
as
*NL*
happily
as
his
master
expected
,
he
determined
to
leave
him
and
go
back
to
*NL*
his
wife
and
children
and
his
ordinary
labour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
was
carrying
away
the
valise
and
the
books
,
but
the
curate
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
Wait
;
I
want
to
see
what
those
papers
are
that
are
written
*NL*
in
such
a
good
hand

''
The
landlord
taking
them
out
handed
them
to
him
to
*NL*
read
,
and
he
perceived
they
were
a
work
of
about
eight
sheets
of
*NL*
manuscript
,
with
,
in
large
letters
at
the
beginning
,
the
title
of
``
Novel
*NL*
of
the
Ill-advised
Curiosity
.
''
The
curate
read
three
or
four
lines
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
said
,
``
I
must
say
the
title
of
this
novel
does
not
seem
to
*NL*
me
a
bad
one
,
and
I
feel
an
inclination
to
read
it
all
.
''
To
which
the
*NL*
landlord
replied
,
``
Then
your
reverence
will
do
well
to

I
can
*NL*
tell
you
that
some

read
it
here
have
been
much
pleased
*NL*
with
it

have
begged
it

very
earnestly

I
would
not
give
*NL*
it

meaning
to
return
it
to
the
person

forgot
the

some

other

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
right

said
the
curate
;

*NL*
``
With

the

*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
talking
Cardenio
had
taken
up
the
novel
and
begun
to
read
*NL*
it
,
and
forming
the
same
opinion
of
it
as
the
curate
,
he
begged
him
to
*NL*
read
it
so
that
they
might
all
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
read
it

the

,
``

the
time
would
not
be
better
*NL*
spent
in
sleeping

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
rest
enough
for
me

said
Dorothea
,
``
to

away

by
listening

some

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

out

*NL*
*NL*
Master
Nicholas
added
his
entreaties
to
the

effect

and
Sancho
too
;

seeing
which

considering
that

would
give
pleasure
to
all

receive
it

said

CHAPTER
XXXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
IS
RELATED
THE
NOVEL
OF
``
THE
ILL-ADVISED
CURIOSITY
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
Florence
,
a
rich
and
famous
city
of
Italy
in
the
province
called
*NL*
Tuscany
,
there
lived
two
gentlemen
of
wealth
and
quality
,
Anselmo
and
*NL*
Lothario
,
such
great
friends
that
by
way
of
distinction
they
were
called
*NL*
by
all
that
knew
them
``
The
Two
Friends
.
''
They
were
unmarried
,
young
,
of
*NL*
the
same
age
and
of
the
same
tastes
,
which
was
enough
to
account
for
the
*NL*
reciprocal
friendship
between
them
.
Anselmo
,
it
is
true
,
was
somewhat
*NL*
more
inclined
to
seek
pleasure
in
love
than
Lothario
,
for
whom
the
*NL*
pleasures
of
the
chase
had
more
attraction
;
but
on
occasion
Anselmo
would
*NL*
forego
his
own
tastes
to
yield
to
those
of
Lothario
,
and
Lothario
would
*NL*
surrender
his
to
fall
in
with
those
of
Anselmo
,
and
in
this
way
their
*NL*
inclinations
kept
pace
one
with
the
other
with
a
concord
so
perfect
that
*NL*
the
best
regulated
clock
could
not
surpass
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
was
deep
in
love
with
a
high-born
and
beautiful
maiden
of
the
*NL*
same
city
,
the
daughter
of
parents
so
estimable
,
and
so
estimable
*NL*
herself
,
that
he
resolved
,
with
the
approval
of
his
friend
Lothario
,
*NL*
without
whom
he
did
nothing
,
to
ask
her
of
them
in
marriage
,
and
did
so
,
*NL*
Lothario
being
the
bearer
of
the
demand
,
and
conducting
the
negotiation
*NL*
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
friend
that
in
a
short
time
he
was
in
*NL*
possession
of
the
object
of
his
desires
,
and
Camilla
so
happy
in
having
*NL*
won
Anselmo
for
her
husband
,
that
she
gave
thanks
unceasingly
to
heaven
*NL*
and
to
Lothario
,
by
whose
means
such
good
fortune
had
fallen
to
her
.
The
*NL*
first
few
days
,
those
of
a
wedding
being
usually
days
of
merry-making
,
*NL*
Lothario
frequented
his
friend
Anselmo
's
house
as
he
had
been
wont
,
*NL*
striving
to
do
honour
to
him
and
to
the
occasion
,
and
to
gratify
him
in
*NL*
every
way
he
could
;
but
when
the
wedding
days
were
over
and
the
*NL*
succession
of
visits
and
congratulations
had
slackened
,
he
began
*NL*
purposely
to
leave
off
going
to
the
house
of
Anselmo
,
for
it
seemed
to
*NL*
him
,
as
it
naturally
would
to
all
men
of
sense
,
that
friends
'
houses
*NL*
ought
not
to
be
visited
after
marriage
with
the
same
frequency
as
in
*NL*
their
masters
'
bachelor
days
:
because
,
though
true
and
genuine
friendship
*NL*
can
not
and
should
not
be
in
any
way
suspicious
,
still
a
married
man
's
*NL*
honour
is
a
thing
of
such
delicacy
that
it
is
held
liable
to
injury
from
*NL*
brothers
,
much
more
from
friends
.
Anselmo
remarked
the
cessation
of
*NL*
Lothario
's
visits
,
and
complained
of
it
to
him
,
saying
that
if
he
had
*NL*
known
that
marriage
was
to
keep
him
from
enjoying
his
society
as
he
used
,
*NL*
he
would
have
never
married
;
and
that
,
if
by
the
thorough
harmony
that
*NL*
subsisted
between
them
while
he
was
a
bachelor
they
had
earned
such
a
*NL*
sweet
name
as
that
of
``
The
Two
Friends
,
''
he
should
not
allow
a
title
so
*NL*
rare
and
so
delightful
to
be
lost
through
a
needless
anxiety
to
act
*NL*
circumspectly
;
and
so
he
entreated
him
,
if
such
a
phrase
was
allowable
*NL*
between
them
,
to
be
once
more
master
of
his
house
and
to
come
in
and
go
*NL*
out
as
formerly
,
assuring
him
that
his
wife
Camilla
had
no
other
desire
*NL*
or
inclination
than
that
which
he
would
wish
her
to
have
,
and
that
*NL*
knowing
how
sincerely
they
loved
one
another
she
was
grieved
to
see
such
*NL*
coldness
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
and
much
more
that
Anselmo
said
to
Lothario
to
persuade
him
*NL*
to
come
to
his
house
as
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
,
Lothario
*NL*
replied
with
so
much
prudence
,
sense
,
and
judgment
,
that
Anselmo
was
*NL*
satisfied
of
his
friend
's
good
intentions
,
and
it
was
agreed
that
on
two
*NL*
days
in
the
week
,
and
on
holidays
,
Lothario
should
come
to
dine
with
him
;
*NL*
but
though
this
arrangement
was
made
between
them
Lothario
resolved
to
*NL*
observe
it
no
further
than
he
considered
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
*NL*
honour
of
his
friend
,
whose
good
name
was
more
to
him
than
his
own
.
He
*NL*
said
,
and
justly
,
that
a
married
man
upon
whom
heaven
had
bestowed
a
*NL*
beautiful
wife
should
consider
as
carefully
what
friends
he
brought
to
*NL*
his
house
as
what
female
friends
his
wife
associated
with
,
for
what
*NL*
can
not
be
done
or
arranged
in
the
market-place
,
in
church
,
at
public
*NL*
festivals
or
at
stations
-LRB-
opportunities
that
husbands
can
not
always
deny
*NL*
their
wives
-RRB-
,
may
be
easily
managed
in
the
house
of
the
female
friend
or
*NL*
relative
in
whom
most
confidence
is
reposed
.
Lothario
said
,
too
,
that
*NL*
every
married
man
should
have
some
friend
who
would
point
out
to
him
any
*NL*
negligence
he
might
be
guilty
of
in
his
conduct
,
for
it
will
sometimes
*NL*
happen
that
owing
to
the
deep
affection
the
husband
bears
his
wife
either
*NL*
he
does
not
caution
her
,
or
,
not
to
vex
her
,
refrains
from
telling
her
to
*NL*
do
or
not
to
do
certain
things
,
doing
or
avoiding
which
may
be
a
matter
*NL*
of
honour
or
reproach
to
him
;
and
errors
of
this
kind
he
could
easily
*NL*
correct
if
warned
by
a
friend
.
But
where
is
such
a
friend
to
be
found
as
*NL*
Lothario
would
have
,
so
judicious
,
so
loyal
,
and
so
true
?
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
truth
I
know
not
;
Lothario
alone
was
such
a
one
,
for
with
the
utmost
*NL*
care
and
vigilance
he
watched
over
the
honour
of
his
friend
,
and
strove
*NL*
to
diminish
,
cut
down
,
and
reduce
the
number
of
days
for
going
to
his
*NL*
house
according
to
their
agreement
,
lest
the
visits
of
a
young
man
,
*NL*
wealthy
,
high-born
,
and
with
the
attractions
he
was
conscious
of
*NL*
possessing
,
at
the
house
of
a
woman
so
beautiful
as
Camilla
,
should
be
*NL*
regarded
with
suspicion
by
the
inquisitive
and
malicious
eyes
of
the
idle
*NL*
public
.
For
though
his
integrity
and
reputation
might
bridle
slanderous
*NL*
tongues
,
still
he
was
unwilling
to
hazard
either
his
own
good
name
or
*NL*
that
of
his
friend
;
and
for
this
reason
most
of
the
days
agreed
upon
he
*NL*
devoted
to
some
other
business
which
he
pretended
was
unavoidable
;
so
*NL*
that
a
great
portion
of
the
day
was
taken
up
with
complaints
on
one
side
*NL*
and
excuses
on
the
other
.
It
happened
,
however
,
that
on
one
occasion
when
*NL*
the
two
were
strolling
together
outside
the
city
,
Anselmo
addressed
the
*NL*
following
words
to
Lothario
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
mayest
suppose
,
Lothario
my
friend
,
that
I
am
unable
to
give
*NL*
sufficient
thanks
for
the
favours
God
has
rendered
me
in
making
me
the
*NL*
son
of
such
parents
as
mine
were
,
and
bestowing
upon
me
with
no
niggard
*NL*
hand
what
are
called
the
gifts
of
nature
as
well
as
those
of
fortune
,
and
*NL*
above
all
for
what
he
has
done
in
giving
me
thee
for
a
friend
and
Camilla
*NL*
for
a
wife
--
two
treasures
that
I
value
,
if
not
as
highly
as
I
ought
,
at
*NL*
least
as
highly
as
I
am
able
.
And
yet
,
with
all
these
good
things
,
which
*NL*
are
commonly
all
that
men
need
to
enable
them
to
live
happily
,
I
am
the
*NL*
most
discontented
and
dissatisfied
man
in
the
whole
world
;
for
,
I
know
*NL*
not
how
long
since
,
I
have
been
harassed
and
oppressed
by
a
desire
so
*NL*
strange
and
so
unusual
,
that
I
wonder
at
myself
and
blame
and
chide
*NL*
myself
when
I
am
alone
,
and
strive
to
stifle
it
and
hide
it
from
my
own
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
with
no
better
success
than
if
I
were
endeavouring
*NL*
deliberately
to
publish
it
to
all
the
world
;
and
as
,
in
short
,
it
must
*NL*
come
out
,
I
would
confide
it
to
thy
safe
keeping
,
feeling
sure
that
by
*NL*
this
means
,
and
by
thy
readiness
as
a
true
friend
to
afford
me
relief
,
I
*NL*
shall
soon
find
myself
freed
from
the
distress
it
causes
me
,
and
that
thy
*NL*
care
will
give
me
happiness
in
the
same
degree
as
my
own
folly
has
caused
*NL*
me
misery
.

The
words
of
Anselmo
struck
Lothario
with
astonishment
,
unable
as
he
was
*NL*
to
conjecture
the
purport
of
such
a
lengthy
preamble
;
and
though
be
*NL*
strove
to
imagine
what
desire
it
could
be
that
so
troubled
his
friend
,
*NL*
his
conjectures
were
all
far
from
the
truth
,
and
to
relieve
the
anxiety
*NL*
which
this
perplexity
was
causing
him
,
he
told
him
he
was
doing
a
*NL*
flagrant
injustice
to
their
great
friendship
in
seeking
circuitous
*NL*
methods
of
confiding
to
him
his
most
hidden
thoughts
,
for
he
well
knew
he
*NL*
might
reckon
upon
his
counsel
in
diverting
them
,
or
his
help
in
carrying
*NL*
them
into
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
truth
,
''
replied
Anselmo
,
``
and
relying
upon
that
I
will
tell
*NL*
thee
,
friend
Lothario
,
that
the
desire
which
harasses
me
is
that
of
*NL*
knowing
whether
my
wife
Camilla
is
as
good
and
as
perfect
as
I
think
her
*NL*
to
be
;
and
I
can
not
satisfy
myself
of
the
truth
on
this
point
except
by
*NL*
testing
her
in
such
a
way
that
the
trial
may
prove
the
purity
of
her
*NL*
virtue
as
the
fire
proves
that
of
gold
;
because
I
am
persuaded
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
that
a
woman
is
virtuous
only
in
proportion
as
she
is
or
is
not
*NL*
tempted
;
and
that
she
alone
is
strong
who
does
not
yield
to
the
promises
,
*NL*
gifts
,
tears
,
and
importunities
of
earnest
lovers
;
for
what
thanks
does
a
*NL*
woman
deserve
for
being
good
if
no
one
urges
her
to
be
bad
,
and
what
*NL*
wonder
is
it
that
she
is
reserved
and
circumspect
to
whom
no
opportunity
*NL*
is
given
of
going
wrong
and
who
knows
she
has
a
husband
that
will
take
*NL*
her
life
the
first
time
he
detects
her
in
an
impropriety
?
I
do
not
*NL*
therefore
hold
her
who
is
virtuous
through
fear
or
want
of
opportunity
in
*NL*
the
same
estimation
as
her
who
comes
out
of
temptation
and
trial
with
a
*NL*
crown
of
victory
;
and
so
,
for
these
reasons
and
many
others
that
I
could
*NL*
give
thee
to
justify
and
support
the
opinion
I
hold
,
I
am
desirous
that
*NL*
my
wife
Camilla
should
pass
this
crisis
,
and
be
refined
and
tested
by
the
*NL*
fire
of
finding
herself
wooed
and
by
one
worthy
to
set
his
affections
*NL*
upon
her
;
and
if
she
comes
out
,
as
I
know
she
will
,
victorious
from
this
*NL*
struggle
,
I
shall
look
upon
my
good
fortune
as
unequalled
,
I
shall
be
*NL*
able
to
say
that
the
cup
of
my
desire
is
full
,
and
that
the
virtuous
*NL*
woman
of
whom
the
sage
says
`
Who
shall
find
her
?
'
has
fallen
to
my
lot
.
*NL*
And
if
the
result
be
the
contrary
of
what
I
expect
,
in
the
satisfaction
*NL*
of
knowing
that
I
have
been
right
in
my
opinion
,
I
shall
bear
without
*NL*
complaint
the
pain
which
my
so
dearly
bought
experience
will
naturally
*NL*
cause
me
.
And
,
as
nothing
of
all
thou
wilt
urge
in
opposition
to
my
wish
*NL*
will
avail
to
keep
me
from
carrying
it
into
effect
,
it
is
my
desire
,
*NL*
friend
Lothario
,
that
thou
shouldst
consent
to
become
the
instrument
for
*NL*
effecting
this
purpose
that
I
am
bent
upon
,
for
I
will
afford
thee
*NL*
opportunities
to
that
end
,
and
nothing
shall
be
wanting
that
I
may
think
*NL*
necessary
for
the
pursuit
of
a
virtuous
,
honourable
,
modest
and
*NL*
high-minded
woman
.
And
among
other
reasons
,
I
am
induced
to
entrust
this
*NL*
arduous
task
to
thee
by
the
consideration
that
if
Camilla
be
conquered
by
*NL*
thee
the
conquest
will
not
be
pushed
to
extremes
,
but
only
far
enough
to
*NL*
account
that
accomplished
which
from
a
sense
of
honour
will
be
left
*NL*
undone
;
thus
I
shall
not
be
wronged
in
anything
more
than
intention
,
and
*NL*
my
wrong
will
remain
buried
in
the
integrity
of
thy
silence
,
which
I
know
*NL*
well
will
be
as
lasting
as
that
of
death
in
what
concerns
me
.
If
,
*NL*
therefore
,
thou
wouldst
have
me
enjoy
what
can
be
called
life
,
thou
wilt
*NL*
at
once
engage
in
this
love
struggle
,
not
lukewarmly
nor
slothfully
,
but
*NL*
with
the
energy
and
zeal
that
my
desire
demands
,
and
with
the
loyalty
our
*NL*
friendship
assures
me
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
words
Anselmo
addressed
to
Lothario
,
who
listened
to
them
*NL*
with
such
attention
that
,
except
to
say
what
has
been
already
mentioned
,
*NL*
he
did
not
open
his
lips
until
the
other
had
finished
.
Then
perceiving
*NL*
that
he
had
no
more
to
say
,
after
regarding
him
for
awhile
,
as
one
would
*NL*
regard
something
never
before
seen
that
excited
wonder
and
amazement
,
he
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
I
can
not
persuade
myself
,
Anselmo
my
friend
,
that
what
thou
*NL*
hast
said
to
me
is
not
in
jest
;
if
I
thought
that
thou
wert
speaking
*NL*
seriously
I
would
not
have
allowed
thee
to
go
so
far
;
so
as
to
put
a
stop
*NL*
to
thy
long
harangue
by
not
listening
to
thee
I
verily
suspect
that
*NL*
either
thou
dost
not
know
me
,
or
I
do
not
know
thee
;
but
no
,
I
know
well
*NL*
thou
art
Anselmo
,
and
thou
knowest
that
I
am
Lothario
;
the
misfortune
is
,
*NL*
it
seems
to
me
,
that
thou
art
not
the
Anselmo
thou
wert
,
and
must
have
*NL*
thought
that
I
am
not
the
Lothario
I
should
be
;
for
the
things
that
thou
*NL*
hast
said
to
me
are
not
those
of
that
Anselmo
who
was
my
friend
,
nor
are
*NL*
those
that
thou
demandest
of
me
what
should
be
asked
of
the
Lothario
thou
*NL*
knowest
.
True
friends
will
prove
their
friends
and
make
use
of
them
,
as
a
*NL*
poet
has
said
,
usque
ad
aras
;
whereby
he
meant
that
they
will
not
make
*NL*
use
of
their
friendship
in
things
that
are
contrary
to
God
's
will
.
If
*NL*
this
,
then
,
was
a
heathen
's
feeling
about
friendship
,
how
much
more
*NL*
should
it
be
a
Christian
's
,
who
knows
that
the
divine
must
not
be
*NL*
forfeited
for
the
sake
of
any
human
friendship
?
And
if
a
friend
should
go
*NL*
so
far
as
to
put
aside
his
duty
to
Heaven
to
fulfil
his
duty
to
his
*NL*
friend
,
it
should
not
be
in
matters
that
are
trifling
or
of
little
*NL*
moment
,
but
in
such
as
affect
the
friend
's
life
and
honour
.
Now
tell
me
,
*NL*
Anselmo
,
in
which
of
these
two
art
thou
imperilled
,
that
I
should
hazard
*NL*
myself
to
gratify
thee
,
and
do
a
thing
so
detestable
as
that
thou
seekest
*NL*
of
me
?
Neither
forsooth
;
on
the
contrary
,
thou
dost
ask
of
me
,
so
far
as
*NL*
I
understand
,
to
strive
and
labour
to
rob
thee
of
honour
and
life
,
and
to
*NL*
rob
myself
of
them
at
the
same
time
;
for
if
I
take
away
thy
honour
it
is
*NL*
plain
I
take
away
thy
life
,
as
a
man
without
honour
is
worse
than
dead
;
*NL*
and
being
the
instrument
,
as
thou
wilt
have
it
so
,
of
so
much
wrong
to
*NL*
thee
,
shall
not
I
,
too
,
be
left
without
honour
,
and
consequently
without
*NL*
life
?
Listen
to
me
,
Anselmo
my
friend
,
and
be
not
impatient
to
answer
me
*NL*
until
I
have
said
what
occurs
to
me
touching
the
object
of
thy
desire
,
*NL*
for
there
will
be
time
enough
left
for
thee
to
reply
and
for
me
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
it
so
,
''
said
Anselmo
,
``
say
what
thou
wilt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lothario
then
went
on
to
say
,
``
It
seems
to
me
,
Anselmo
,
that
thine
is
*NL*
just
now
the
temper
of
mind
which
is
always
that
of
the
Moors
,
who
can
*NL*
never
be
brought
to
see
the
error
of
their
creed
by
quotations
from
the
*NL*
Holy
Scriptures
,
or
by
reasons
which
depend
upon
the
examination
of
the
*NL*
understanding
or
are
founded
upon
the
articles
of
faith
,
but
must
have
*NL*
examples
that
are
palpable
,
easy
,
intelligible
,
capable
of
proof
,
not
*NL*
admitting
of
doubt
,
with
mathematical
demonstrations
that
can
not
be
*NL*
denied
,
like
,
`
If
equals
be
taken
from
equals
,
the
remainders
are
equal
:
'
*NL*
and
if
they
do
not
understand
this
in
words
,
and
indeed
they
do
not
,
it
*NL*
has
to
be
shown
to
them
with
the
hands
,
and
put
before
their
eyes
,
and
*NL*
even
with
all
this
no
one
succeeds
in
convincing
them
of
the
truth
of
our
*NL*
holy
religion
.
This
same
mode
of
proceeding
I
shall
have
to
adopt
with
*NL*
thee
,
for
the
desire
which
has
sprung
up
in
thee
is
so
absurd
and
remote
*NL*
from
everything
that
has
a
semblance
of
reason
,
that
I
feel
it
would
be
a
*NL*
waste
of
time
to
employ
it
in
reasoning
with
thy
simplicity
,
for
at
*NL*
present
I
will
call
it
by
no
other
name
;
and
I
am
even
tempted
to
leave
*NL*
thee
in
thy
folly
as
a
punishment
for
thy
pernicious
desire
;
but
the
*NL*
friendship
I
bear
thee
,
which
will
not
allow
me
to
desert
thee
in
such
*NL*
manifest
danger
of
destruction
,
keeps
me
from
dealing
so
harshly
by
thee
.
*NL*
And
that
thou
mayest
clearly
see
this
,
say
,
Anselmo
,
hast
thou
not
told
*NL*
me
that
I
must
force
my
suit
upon
a
modest
woman
,
decoy
one
that
is
*NL*
virtuous
,
make
overtures
to
one
that
is
pure-minded
,
pay
court
to
one
*NL*
that
is
prudent
?
Yes
,
thou
hast
told
me
so
.
Then
,
if
thou
knowest
that
*NL*
thou
hast
a
wife
,
modest
,
virtuous
,
pure-minded
and
prudent
,
what
is
it
*NL*
that
thou
seekest
?
And
if
thou
believest
that
she
will
come
forth
*NL*
victorious
from
all
my
attacks
--
as
doubtless
she
would
--
what
higher
*NL*
titles
than
those
she
possesses
now
dost
thou
think
thou
canst
upon
her
*NL*
then
,
or
in
what
will
she
be
better
then
than
she
is
now
?
Either
thou
*NL*
dost
not
hold
her
to
be
what
thou
sayest
,
or
thou
knowest
not
what
thou
*NL*
dost
demand
.
If
thou
dost
not
hold
her
to
be
what
thou
why
dost
thou
seek
*NL*
to
prove
her
instead
of
treating
her
as
guilty
in
the
way
that
may
seem
*NL*
best
to
thee
?
but
if
she
be
as
virtuous
as
thou
believest
,
it
is
an
*NL*
uncalled-for
proceeding
to
make
trial
of
truth
itself
,
for
,
after
trial
,
*NL*
it
will
but
be
in
the
same
estimation
as
before
.
Thus
,
then
,
it
is
*NL*
conclusive
that
to
attempt
things
from
which
harm
rather
than
advantage
*NL*
may
come
to
us
is
the
part
of
unreasoning
and
reckless
minds
,
more
*NL*
especially
when
they
are
things
which
we
are
not
forced
or
compelled
to
*NL*
attempt
,
and
which
show
from
afar
that
it
is
plainly
madness
to
attempt
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Difficulties
are
attempted
either
for
the
sake
of
God
or
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
the
world
,
or
for
both
;
those
undertaken
for
God
's
sake
are
those
which
*NL*
the
saints
undertake
when
they
attempt
to
live
the
lives
of
angels
in
*NL*
human
bodies
;
those
undertaken
for
the
sake
of
the
world
are
those
of
the
*NL*
men
who
traverse
such
a
vast
expanse
of
water
,
such
a
variety
of
*NL*
climates
,
so
many
strange
countries
,
to
acquire
what
are
called
the
*NL*
blessings
of
fortune
;
and
those
undertaken
for
the
sake
of
God
and
the
*NL*
world
together
are
those
of
brave
soldiers
,
who
no
sooner
do
they
see
in
*NL*
the
enemy
's
wall
a
breach
as
wide
as
a
cannon
ball
could
make
,
than
,
*NL*
casting
aside
all
fear
,
without
hesitating
,
or
heeding
the
manifest
peril
*NL*
that
threatens
them
,
borne
onward
by
the
desire
of
defending
their
faith
,
*NL*
their
country
,
and
their
king
,
they
fling
themselves
dauntlessly
into
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
thousand
opposing
deaths
that
await
them
.
Such
are
the
*NL*
things
that
men
are
wont
to
attempt
,
and
there
is
honour
,
glory
,
gain
,
in
*NL*
attempting
them
,
however
full
of
difficulty
and
peril
they
may
be
;
but
*NL*
that
which
thou
sayest
it
is
thy
wish
to
attempt
and
carry
out
will
not
*NL*
win
thee
the
glory
of
God
nor
the
blessings
of
fortune
nor
fame
among
*NL*
men
;
for
even
if
the
issue
be
as
thou
wouldst
have
it
,
thou
wilt
be
no
*NL*
happier
,
richer
,
or
more
honoured
than
thou
art
this
moment
;
and
if
it
be
*NL*
otherwise
thou
wilt
be
reduced
to
misery
greater
than
can
be
imagined
,
*NL*
for
then
it
will
avail
thee
nothing
to
reflect
that
no
one
is
aware
of
*NL*
the
misfortune
that
has
befallen
thee
;
it
will
suffice
to
torture
and
*NL*
crush
thee
that
thou
knowest
it
thyself
.
And
in
confirmation
of
the
truth
*NL*
of
what
I
say
,
let
me
repeat
to
thee
a
stanza
made
by
the
famous
poet
*NL*
Luigi
Tansillo
at
the
end
of
the
first
part
of
his
`
Tears
of
Saint
*NL*
Peter
,
'
which
says
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
anguish
and
the
shame
but
greater
grew
In
Peter
's
heart
as
morning
*NL*
slowly
came
;
No
eye
was
there
to
see
him
,
well
he
knew
,
Yet
he
himself
*NL*
was
to
himself
a
shame
;
Exposed
to
all
men
's
gaze
,
or
screened
from
view
,
*NL*
A
noble
heart
will
feel
the
pang
the
same
;
A
prey
to
shame
the
sinning
*NL*
soul
will
be
,
Though
none
but
heaven
and
earth
its
shame
can
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
by
keeping
it
secret
thou
wilt
not
escape
thy
sorrow
,
but
rather
*NL*
thou
wilt
shed
tears
unceasingly
,
if
not
tears
of
the
eyes
,
tears
of
*NL*
blood
from
the
heart
,
like
those
shed
by
that
simple
doctor
our
poet
*NL*
tells
us
of
,
that
tried
the
test
of
the
cup
,
which
the
wise
Rinaldo
,
*NL*
better
advised
,
refused
to
do
;
for
though
this
may
be
a
poetic
fiction
it
*NL*
contains
a
moral
lesson
worthy
of
attention
and
study
and
imitation
.
*NL*
Moreover
by
what
I
am
about
to
say
to
thee
thou
wilt
be
led
to
see
the
*NL*
great
error
thou
wouldst
commit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
Anselmo
,
if
Heaven
or
good
fortune
had
made
thee
master
and
*NL*
lawful
owner
of
a
diamond
of
the
finest
quality
,
with
the
excellence
and
*NL*
purity
of
which
all
the
lapidaries
that
had
seen
it
had
been
satisfied
,
*NL*
saying
with
one
voice
and
common
consent
that
in
purity
,
quality
,
and
*NL*
fineness
,
it
was
all
that
a
stone
of
the
kind
could
possibly
be
,
thou
*NL*
thyself
too
being
of
the
same
belief
,
as
knowing
nothing
to
the
contrary
,
*NL*
would
it
be
reasonable
in
thee
to
desire
to
take
that
diamond
and
place
*NL*
it
between
an
anvil
and
a
hammer
,
and
by
mere
force
of
blows
and
strength
*NL*
of
arm
try
if
it
were
as
hard
and
as
fine
as
they
said
?
And
if
thou
*NL*
didst
,
and
if
the
stone
should
resist
so
silly
a
test
,
that
would
add
*NL*
nothing
to
its
value
or
reputation
;
and
if
it
were
broken
,
as
it
might
*NL*
be
,
would
not
all
be
lost
?
Undoubtedly
it
would
,
leaving
its
owner
to
be
*NL*
rated
as
a
fool
in
the
opinion
of
all
.
Consider
,
then
,
Anselmo
my
friend
,
*NL*
that
Camilla
is
a
diamond
of
the
finest
quality
as
well
in
thy
estimation
*NL*
as
in
that
of
others
,
and
that
it
is
contrary
to
reason
to
expose
her
to
*NL*
the
risk
of
being
broken
;
for
if
she
remains
intact
she
can
not
rise
to
a
*NL*
higher
value
than
she
now
possesses
;
and
if
she
give
way
and
be
unable
to
*NL*
resist
,
bethink
thee
now
how
thou
wilt
be
deprived
of
her
,
and
with
what
*NL*
good
reason
thou
wilt
complain
of
thyself
for
having
been
the
cause
of
*NL*
her
ruin
and
thine
own
.
Remember
there
is
no
jewel
in
the
world
so
*NL*
precious
as
a
chaste
and
virtuous
woman
,
and
that
the
whole
honour
of
*NL*
women
consists
in
reputation
;
and
since
thy
wife
's
is
of
that
high
*NL*
excellence
that
thou
knowest
,
wherefore
shouldst
thou
seek
to
call
that
*NL*
truth
in
question
?
Remember
,
my
friend
,
that
woman
is
an
imperfect
*NL*
animal
,
and
that
impediments
are
not
to
be
placed
in
her
way
to
make
her
*NL*
trip
and
fall
,
but
that
they
should
be
removed
,
and
her
path
left
clear
*NL*
of
all
obstacles
,
so
that
without
hindrance
she
may
run
her
course
freely
*NL*
to
attain
the
desired
perfection
,
which
consists
in
being
virtuous
.
*NL*
Naturalists
tell
us
that
the
ermine
is
a
little
animal
which
has
a
fur
of
*NL*
purest
white
,
and
that
when
the
hunters
wish
to
take
it
,
they
make
use
of
*NL*
this
artifice
.
Having
ascertained
the
places
which
it
frequents
and
*NL*
passes
,
they
stop
the
way
to
them
with
mud
,
and
then
rousing
it
,
drive
it
*NL*
towards
the
spot
,
and
as
soon
as
the
ermine
comes
to
the
mud
it
halts
,
*NL*
and
allows
itself
to
be
taken
captive
rather
than
pass
through
the
mire
,
*NL*
and
spoil
and
sully
its
whiteness
,
which
it
values
more
than
life
and
*NL*
liberty
.
The
virtuous
and
chaste
woman
is
an
ermine
,
and
whiter
and
purer
*NL*
than
snow
is
the
virtue
of
modesty
;
and
he
who
wishes
her
not
to
lose
it
,
*NL*
but
to
keep
and
preserve
it
,
must
adopt
a
course
different
from
that
*NL*
employed
with
the
ermine
;
he
must
not
put
before
her
the
mire
of
the
*NL*
gifts
and
attentions
of
persevering
lovers
,
because
perhaps
--
and
even
*NL*
without
a
perhaps
--
she
may
not
have
sufficient
virtue
and
natural
*NL*
strength
in
herself
to
pass
through
and
tread
under
foot
these
*NL*
impediments
;
they
must
be
removed
,
and
the
brightness
of
virtue
and
the
*NL*
beauty
of
a
fair
fame
must
be
put
before
her
.
A
virtuous
woman
,
too
,
is
*NL*
like
a
mirror
,
of
clear
shining
crystal
,
liable
to
be
tarnished
and
*NL*
dimmed
by
every
breath
that
touches
it
.
She
must
be
treated
as
relics
*NL*
are
;
adored
,
not
touched
.
She
must
be
protected
and
prized
as
one
*NL*
protects
and
prizes
a
fair
garden
full
of
roses
and
flowers
,
the
owner
of
*NL*
which
allows
no
one
to
trespass
or
pluck
a
blossom
;
enough
for
others
*NL*
that
from
afar
and
through
the
iron
grating
they
may
enjoy
its
fragrance
*NL*
and
its
beauty
.
Finally
let
me
repeat
to
thee
some
verses
that
come
to
my
*NL*
mind
;
I
heard
them
in
a
modern
comedy
,
and
it
seems
to
me
they
bear
upon
*NL*
the
point
we
are
discussing
.
A
prudent
old
man
was
giving
advice
to
*NL*
another
,
the
father
of
a
young
girl
,
to
lock
her
up
,
watch
over
her
and
*NL*
keep
her
in
seclusion
,
and
among
other
arguments
he
used
these
:
*NL*
*NL*
Woman
is
a
thing
of
glass
;
*NL*
But
her
brittleness
't
is
best
*NL*
Not
too
curiously
to
test
:
*NL*
Who
knows
what
may
come
to
pass
?
*NL*
*NL*
Breaking
is
an
easy
matter
,
*NL*
And
it
's
folly
to
expose
*NL*
What
you
can
not
mend
to
blows
;
*NL*
What
you
ca
n't
make
whole
to
shatter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
then
,
all
may
hold
as
true
,
*NL*
And
the
reason
's
plain
to
see
;
*NL*
For
if
Danaes
there
be
,
*NL*
There
are
golden
showers
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
I
have
said
to
thee
so
far
,
Anselmo
,
has
had
reference
to
what
*NL*
concerns
thee
;
now
it
is
right
that
I
should
say
something
of
what
*NL*
regards
myself
;
and
if
I
be
prolix
,
pardon
me
,
for
the
labyrinth
into
*NL*
which
thou
hast
entered
and
from
which
thou
wouldst
have
me
extricate
*NL*
thee
makes
it
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
dost
reckon
me
thy
friend
,
and
thou
wouldst
rob
me
of
honour
,
a
*NL*
thing
wholly
inconsistent
with
friendship
;
and
not
only
dost
thou
aim
at
*NL*
this
,
but
thou
wouldst
have
me
rob
thee
of
it
also
.
That
thou
wouldst
rob
*NL*
me
of
it
is
clear
,
for
when
Camilla
sees
that
I
pay
court
to
her
as
thou
*NL*
requirest
,
she
will
certainly
regard
me
as
a
man
without
honour
or
right
*NL*
feeling
,
since
I
attempt
and
do
a
thing
so
much
opposed
to
what
I
owe
to
*NL*
my
own
position
and
thy
friendship
.
That
thou
wouldst
have
me
rob
thee
of
*NL*
it
is
beyond
a
doubt
,
for
Camilla
,
seeing
that
I
press
my
suit
upon
her
,
*NL*
will
suppose
that
I
have
perceived
in
her
something
light
that
has
*NL*
encouraged
me
to
make
known
to
her
my
base
desire
;
and
if
she
holds
*NL*
herself
dishonoured
,
her
dishonour
touches
thee
as
belonging
to
her
;
and
*NL*
hence
arises
what
so
commonly
takes
place
,
that
the
husband
of
the
*NL*
adulterous
woman
,
though
he
may
not
be
aware
of
or
have
given
any
cause
*NL*
for
his
wife
's
failure
in
her
duty
,
or
-LRB-
being
careless
or
negligent
-RRB-
have
*NL*
had
it
in
his
power
to
prevent
his
dishonour
,
nevertheless
is
stigmatised
*NL*
by
a
vile
and
reproachful
name
,
and
in
a
manner
regarded
with
eyes
of
*NL*
contempt
instead
of
pity
by
all
who
know
of
his
wife
's
guilt
,
though
they
*NL*
see
that
he
is
unfortunate
not
by
his
own
fault
,
but
by
the
lust
of
a
*NL*
vicious
consort
.
But
I
will
tell
thee
why
with
good
reason
dishonour
*NL*
attaches
to
the
husband
of
the
unchaste
wife
,
though
he
know
not
that
she
*NL*
is
so
,
nor
be
to
blame
,
nor
have
done
anything
,
or
given
any
provocation
*NL*
to
make
her
so
;
and
be
not
weary
with
listening
to
me
,
for
it
will
be
for
*NL*
thy
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
God
created
our
first
parent
in
the
earthly
paradise
,
the
Holy
*NL*
Scripture
says
that
he
infused
sleep
into
Adam
and
while
he
slept
took
a
*NL*
rib
from
his
left
side
of
which
he
formed
our
mother
Eve
,
and
when
Adam
*NL*
awoke
and
beheld
her
he
said
,
`
This
is
flesh
of
my
flesh
,
and
bone
of
my
*NL*
bone
.
'
And
God
said
`
For
this
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
his
*NL*
mother
,
and
they
shall
be
two
in
one
flesh
;
and
then
was
instituted
the
*NL*
divine
sacrament
of
marriage
,
with
such
ties
that
death
alone
can
loose
*NL*
them
.
And
such
is
the
force
and
virtue
of
this
miraculous
sacrament
that
*NL*
it
makes
two
different
persons
one
and
the
same
flesh
;
and
even
more
than
*NL*
this
when
the
virtuous
are
married
;
for
though
they
have
two
souls
they
*NL*
have
but
one
will
.
And
hence
it
follows
that
as
the
flesh
of
the
wife
is
*NL*
one
and
the
same
with
that
of
her
husband
the
stains
that
may
come
upon
*NL*
it
,
or
the
injuries
it
incurs
fall
upon
the
husband
's
flesh
,
though
he
,
*NL*
as
has
been
said
,
may
have
given
no
cause
for
them
;
for
as
the
pain
of
*NL*
the
foot
or
any
member
of
the
body
is
felt
by
the
whole
body
,
because
all
*NL*
is
one
flesh
,
as
the
head
feels
the
hurt
to
the
ankle
without
having
*NL*
caused
it
,
so
the
husband
,
being
one
with
her
,
shares
the
dishonour
of
*NL*
the
wife
;
and
as
all
worldly
honour
or
dishonour
comes
of
flesh
and
*NL*
blood
,
and
the
erring
wife
's
is
of
that
kind
,
the
husband
must
needs
bear
*NL*
his
part
of
it
and
be
held
dishonoured
without
knowing
it
.
See
,
then
,
*NL*
Anselmo
,
the
peril
thou
art
encountering
in
seeking
to
disturb
the
peace
*NL*
of
thy
virtuous
consort
;
see
for
what
an
empty
and
ill-advised
curiosity
*NL*
thou
wouldst
rouse
up
passions
that
now
repose
in
quiet
in
the
breast
of
*NL*
thy
chaste
wife
;
reflect
that
what
thou
art
staking
all
to
win
is
little
,
*NL*
and
what
thou
wilt
lose
so
much
that
I
leave
it
undescribed
,
not
having
*NL*
the
words
to
express
it
.
But
if
all
I
have
said
be
not
enough
to
turn
*NL*
thee
from
thy
vile
purpose
,
thou
must
seek
some
other
instrument
for
thy
*NL*
dishonour
and
misfortune
;
for
such
I
will
not
consent
to
be
,
though
I
*NL*
lose
thy
friendship
,
the
greatest
loss
that
I
can
conceive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
said
this
,
the
wise
and
virtuous
Lothario
was
silent
,
and
Anselmo
,
*NL*
troubled
in
mind
and
deep
in
thought
,
was
unable
for
a
while
to
utter
a
*NL*
word
in
reply
;
but
at
length
he
said
,
``
I
have
listened
,
Lothario
my
*NL*
friend
,
attentively
,
as
thou
hast
seen
,
to
what
thou
hast
chosen
to
say
*NL*
to
me
,
and
in
thy
arguments
,
examples
,
and
comparisons
I
have
seen
that
*NL*
high
intelligence
thou
dost
possess
,
and
the
perfection
of
true
*NL*
friendship
thou
hast
reached
;
and
likewise
I
see
and
confess
that
if
I
am
*NL*
not
guided
by
thy
opinion
,
but
follow
my
own
,
I
am
flying
from
the
good
*NL*
and
pursuing
the
evil
.
This
being
so
,
thou
must
remember
that
I
am
now
*NL*
labouring
under
that
infirmity
which
women
sometimes
suffer
from
,
when
*NL*
the
craving
seizes
them
to
eat
clay
,
plaster
,
charcoal
,
and
things
even
*NL*
worse
,
disgusting
to
look
at
,
much
more
to
eat
;
so
that
it
will
be
*NL*
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
some
artifice
to
cure
me
;
and
this
can
be
*NL*
easily
effected
if
only
thou
wilt
make
a
beginning
,
even
though
it
be
in
*NL*
a
lukewarm
and
make-believe
fashion
,
to
pay
court
to
Camilla
,
who
will
*NL*
not
be
so
yielding
that
her
virtue
will
give
way
at
the
first
attack
:
*NL*
with
this
mere
attempt
I
shall
rest
satisfied
,
and
thou
wilt
have
done
*NL*
what
our
friendship
binds
thee
to
do
,
not
only
in
giving
me
life
,
but
in
*NL*
persuading
me
not
to
discard
my
honour
.
And
this
thou
art
bound
to
do
for
*NL*
one
reason
alone
,
that
,
being
,
as
I
am
,
resolved
to
apply
this
test
,
it
*NL*
is
not
for
thee
to
permit
me
to
reveal
my
weakness
to
another
,
and
so
*NL*
imperil
that
honour
thou
art
striving
to
keep
me
from
losing
;
and
if
*NL*
thine
may
not
stand
as
high
as
it
ought
in
the
estimation
of
Camilla
*NL*
while
thou
art
paying
court
to
her
,
that
is
of
little
or
no
importance
,
*NL*
because
ere
long
,
on
finding
in
her
that
constancy
which
we
expect
,
thou
*NL*
canst
tell
her
the
plain
truth
as
regards
our
stratagem
,
and
so
regain
*NL*
thy
place
in
her
esteem
;
and
as
thou
art
venturing
so
little
,
and
by
the
*NL*
venture
canst
afford
me
so
much
satisfaction
,
refuse
not
to
undertake
it
,
*NL*
even
if
further
difficulties
present
themselves
to
thee
;
for
,
as
I
have
*NL*
said
,
if
thou
wilt
only
make
a
beginning
I
will
acknowledge
the
issue
*NL*
decided

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lothario
seeing
the
fixed
determination
of
Anselmo
,
and
not
knowing
what
*NL*
further
examples
to
offer
or
arguments
to
urge
in
order
to
dissuade
him
*NL*
from
it
,
and
perceiving
that
he
threatened
to
confide
his
pernicious
*NL*
scheme
to
some
one
else
,
to
avoid
a
greater
evil
resolved
to
gratify
him
*NL*
and
do
what
he
asked
,
intending
to
manage
the
business
so
as
to
satisfy
*NL*
Anselmo
without
corrupting
the
mind
of
Camilla
;
so
in
reply
he
told
him
*NL*
not
to
communicate
his
purpose
to
any
other
,
for
he
would
undertake
the
*NL*
task
himself
,
and
would
begin
it
as
soon
as
he
pleased
.
Anselmo
embraced
*NL*
him
warmly
and
affectionately
,
and
thanked
him
for
his
offer
as
if
he
had
*NL*
bestowed
some
great
favour
upon
him
;
and
it
was
agreed
between
them
to
*NL*
set
about
it
the
next
day
,
Anselmo
affording
opportunity
and
time
to
*NL*
Lothario
to
converse
alone
with
Camilla
,
and
furnishing
him
with
money
*NL*
and
jewels
to
offer
and
present
to
her
.
He
suggested
,
too
,
that
he
should
*NL*
treat
her
to
music
,
and
write
verses
in
her
praise
,
and
if
he
was
*NL*
unwilling
to
take
the
trouble
of
composing
them
,
he
offered
to
do
it
*NL*
himself
.
Lothario
agreed
to
all
with
an
intention
very
different
from
*NL*
what
Anselmo
supposed
,
and
with
this
understanding
they
returned
to
*NL*
Anselmo
's
house
,
where
they
found
Camilla
awaiting
her
husband
anxiously
*NL*
and
uneasily
,
for
he
was
later
than
usual
in
returning
that
day
.
Lothario
*NL*
repaired
to
his
own
house
,
and
Anselmo
remained
in
his
,
as
well
satisfied
*NL*
as
Lothario
was
troubled
in
mind
;
for
he
could
see
no
satisfactory
way
*NL*
out
of
this
ill-advised
business
.
That
night
,
however
,
he
thought
of
a
*NL*
plan
by
which
he
might
deceive
Anselmo
without
any
injury
to
Camilla
.
The
*NL*
next
day
he
went
to
dine
with
his
friend
,
and
was
welcomed
by
Camilla
,
*NL*
who
received
and
treated
him
with
great
cordiality
,
knowing
the
affection
*NL*
her
husband
felt
for
him
.
When
dinner
was
over
and
the
cloth
removed
,
*NL*
Anselmo
told
Lothario
to
stay
there
with
Camilla
while
he
attended
to
*NL*
some
pressing
business
,
as
he
would
return
in
an
hour
and
a
half
.
Camilla
*NL*
begged
him
not
to
go
,
and
Lothario
offered
to
accompany
him
,
but
nothing
*NL*
could
persuade
Anselmo
,
who
on
the
contrary
pressed
Lothario
to
remain
*NL*
waiting
for
him
as
he
had
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
discuss
with
*NL*
him
.
At
the
same
time
he
bade
Camilla
not
to
leave
Lothario
alone
until
*NL*
he
came
back
.
In
short
he
contrived
to
put
so
good
a
face
on
the
reason
,
*NL*
or
the
folly
,
of
his
absence
that
no
one
could
have
suspected
it
was
a
*NL*
pretence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
took
his
departure
,
and
Camilla
and
Lothario
were
left
alone
at
*NL*
the
table
,
for
the
rest
of
the
household
had
gone
to
dinner
.
Lothario
saw
*NL*
himself
in
the
lists
according
to
his
friend
's
wish
,
and
facing
an
enemy
*NL*
that
could
by
her
beauty
alone
vanquish
a
squadron
of
armed
knights
;
*NL*
judge
whether
he
had
good
reason
to
fear
;
but
what
he
did
was
to
lean
his
*NL*
elbow
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
,
and
his
cheek
upon
his
hand
,
and
,
asking
*NL*
Camilla
's
pardon
for
his
ill
manners
,
he
said
he
wished
to
take
a
little
*NL*
sleep
until
Anselmo
returned
.
Camilla
in
reply
said
he
could
repose
more
*NL*
at
his
ease
in
the
reception-room
than
in
his
chair
,
and
begged
of
him
to
*NL*
go
in
and
sleep
there
;
but
Lothario
declined
,
and
there
he
remained
*NL*
asleep
until
the
return
of
Anselmo
,
who
finding
Camilla
in
her
own
room
,
*NL*
and
Lothario
asleep
,
imagined
that
he
had
stayed
away
so
long
as
to
have
*NL*
afforded
them
time
enough
for
conversation
and
even
for
sleep
,
and
was
*NL*
all
impatience
until
Lothario
should
wake
up
,
that
he
might
go
out
with
*NL*
him
and
question
him
as
to
his
success
.
Everything
fell
out
as
he
wished
;
*NL*
Lothario
awoke
,
and
the
two
at
once
left
the
house
,
and
Anselmo
asked
*NL*
what
he
was
anxious
to
know
,
and
Lothario
in
answer
told
him
that
he
had
*NL*
not
thought
it
advisable
to
declare
himself
entirely
the
first
time
,
and
*NL*
therefore
had
only
extolled
the
charms
of
Camilla
,
telling
her
that
all
*NL*
the
city
spoke
of
nothing
else
but
her
beauty
and
wit
,
for
this
seemed
to
*NL*
him
an
excellent
way
of
beginning
to
gain
her
good-will
and
render
her
*NL*
disposed
to
listen
to
him
with
pleasure
the
next
time
,
thus
availing
*NL*
himself
of
the
device
the
devil
has
recourse
to
when
he
would
deceive
one
*NL*
who
is
on
the
watch
;
for
he
being
the
angel
of
darkness
transforms
*NL*
himself
into
an
angel
of
light
,
and
,
under
cover
of
a
fair
seeming
,
*NL*
discloses
himself
at
length
,
and
effects
his
purpose
if
at
the
beginning
*NL*
his
wiles
are
not
discovered
.
All
this
gave
great
satisfaction
to
*NL*
Anselmo
,
and
he
said
he
would
afford
the
same
opportunity
every
day
,
but
*NL*
without
leaving
the
house
,
for
he
would
find
things
to
do
at
home
so
that
*NL*
Camilla
should
not
detect
the
plot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
then
,
several
days
went
by
,
and
Lothario
,
without
uttering
a
word
*NL*
to
Camilla
,
reported
to
Anselmo
that
he
had
talked
with
her
and
that
he
*NL*
had
never
been
able
to
draw
from
her
the
slightest
indication
of
consent
*NL*
to
anything
dishonourable
,
nor
even
a
sign
or
shadow
of
hope
;
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
he
said
she
would
inform
her
husband
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
well
,
''
said
Anselmo
;
``
Camilla
has
thus
far
resisted
words
;
we
*NL*
must
now
see
how
she
will
resist
deeds
.
I
will
give
you
to-morrow
two
*NL*
thousand
crowns
in
gold
for
you
to
offer
or
even
present
,
and
as
many
*NL*
more
to
buy
jewels
to
lure
her
,
for
women
are
fond
of
being
becomingly
*NL*
attired
and
going
gaily
dressed
,
and
all
the
more
so
if
they
are
*NL*
beautiful
,
however
chaste
they
may
be
;
and
if
she
resists
this
*NL*
temptation
,
I
will
rest
satisfied
and
will
give
you
no
more
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lothario
replied
that
now
he
had
begun
he
would
carry
on
the
undertaking
*NL*
to
the
end
,
though
he
perceived
he
was
to
come
out
of
it
wearied
and
*NL*
vanquished
.
The
next
day
he
received
the
four
thousand
crowns
,
and
with
*NL*
them
four
thousand
perplexities
,
for
he
knew
not
what
to
say
by
way
of
a
*NL*
new
falsehood
;
but
in
the
end
he
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
him
that
*NL*
Camilla
stood
as
firm
against
gifts
and
promises
as
against
words
,
and
*NL*
that
there
was
no
use
in
taking
any
further
trouble
,
for
the
time
was
all
*NL*
spent
to
no
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
chance
,
directing
things
in
a
different
manner
,
so
ordered
it
that
*NL*
Anselmo
,
having
left
Lothario
and
Camilla
alone
as
on
other
occasions
,
*NL*
shut
himself
into
a
chamber
and
posted
himself
to
watch
and
listen
*NL*
through
the
keyhole
to
what
passed
between
them
,
and
perceived
that
for
*NL*
more
than
half
an
hour
Lothario
did
not
utter
a
word
to
Camilla
,
nor
*NL*
would
utter
a
word
though
he
were
to
be
there
for
an
age
;
and
he
came
to
*NL*
the
conclusion
that
what
his
friend
had
told
him
about
the
replies
of
*NL*
Camilla
was
all
invention
and
falsehood
,
and
to
ascertain
if
it
were
so
,
*NL*
he
came
out
,
and
calling
Lothario
aside
asked
him
what
news
he
had
and
in
*NL*
what
humour
Camilla
was
.
Lothario
replied
that
he
was
not
disposed
to
go
*NL*
on
with
the
business
,
for
she
had
answered
him
so
angrily
and
harshly
*NL*
that
he
had
no
heart
to
say
anything
more
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Lothario
,
Lothario
,
''
said
Anselmo
,
``
how
ill
dost
thou
meet
thy
*NL*
obligations
to
me
,
and
the
great
confidence
I
repose
in
thee
!
I
have
been
*NL*
just
now
watching
through
this
keyhole
,
and
I
have
seen
that
thou
has
not
*NL*
said
a
word
to
Camilla
,
whence
I
conclude
that
on
the
former
occasions
*NL*
thou
hast
not
spoken
to
her
either
,
and
if
this
be
so
,
as
no
doubt
it
is
,
*NL*
why
dost
thou
deceive
me
,
or
wherefore
seekest
thou
by
craft
to
deprive
*NL*
me
of
the
means
I
might
find
of
attaining
my
desire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
said
no
more
,
but
he
had
said
enough
to
cover
Lothario
with
shame
*NL*
and
confusion
,
and
he
,
feeling
as
it
were
his
honour
touched
by
having
*NL*
been
detected
in
a
lie
,
swore
to
Anselmo
that
he
would
from
that
moment
*NL*
devote
himself
to
satisfying
him
without
any
deception
,
as
he
would
see
*NL*
if
he
had
the
curiosity
to
watch
;
though
he
need
not
take
the
trouble
,
*NL*
for
the
pains
he
would
take
to
satisfy
him
would
remove
all
suspicions
*NL*
from
his
mind
.
Anselmo
believed
him
,
and
to
afford
him
an
opportunity
*NL*
more
free
and
less
liable
to
surprise
,
he
resolved
to
absent
himself
from
*NL*
his
house
for
eight
days
,
betaking
himself
to
that
of
a
friend
of
his
who
*NL*
lived
in
a
village
not
far
from
the
city
;
and
,
the
better
to
account
for
*NL*
his
departure
to
Camilla
,
he
so
arranged
it
that
the
friend
should
send
*NL*
him
a
very
pressing
invitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unhappy
,
shortsighted
Anselmo
,
what
art
thou
doing
,
what
art
thou
*NL*
plotting
,
what
art
thou
devising
?
Bethink
thee
thou
art
working
against
*NL*
thyself
,
plotting
thine
own
dishonour
,
devising
thine
own
ruin
.
Thy
wife
*NL*
Camilla
is
virtuous
,
thou
dost
possess
her
in
peace
and
quietness
,
no
one
*NL*
assails
thy
happiness
,
her
thoughts
wander
not
beyond
the
walls
of
thy
*NL*
house
,
thou
art
her
heaven
on
earth
,
the
object
of
her
wishes
,
the
*NL*
fulfilment
of
her
desires
,
the
measure
wherewith
she
measures
her
will
,
*NL*
making
it
conform
in
all
things
to
thine
and
Heaven
's
.
If
,
then
,
the
mine
*NL*
of
her
honour
,
beauty
,
virtue
,
and
modesty
yields
thee
without
labour
all
*NL*
the
wealth
it
contains
and
thou
canst
wish
for
,
why
wilt
thou
dig
the
*NL*
earth
in
search
of
fresh
veins
,
of
new
unknown
treasure
,
risking
the
*NL*
collapse
of
all
,
since
it
but
rests
on
the
feeble
props
of
her
weak
*NL*
nature
?
Bethink
thee
that
from
him
who
seeks
impossibilities
that
which
*NL*
is
possible
may
with
justice
be
withheld
,
as
was
better
expressed
by
a
*NL*
poet
who
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
mine
to
seek
for
life
in
death
,
*NL*
Health
in
disease
seek
I
,
*NL*
I
seek
in
prison
freedom
's
breath
,
*NL*
In
traitors
loyalty
.
*NL*
So
Fate
that
ever
scorns
to
grant
*NL*
Or
grace
or
boon
to
me
,
*NL*
Since
what
can
never
be
I
want
,
*NL*
Denies
me
what
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Anselmo
took
his
departure
for
the
village
,
leaving
*NL*
instructions
with
Camilla
that
during
his
absence
Lothario
would
come
to
*NL*
look
after
his
house
and
to
dine
with
her
,
and
that
she
was
to
treat
him
*NL*
as
she
would
himself
.
Camilla
was
distressed
,
as
a
discreet
and
*NL*
right-minded
woman
would
be
,
at
the
orders
her
husband
left
her
,
and
bade
*NL*
him
remember
that
it
was
not
becoming
that
anyone
should
occupy
his
seat
*NL*
at
the
table
during
his
absence
,
and
if
he
acted
thus
from
not
feeling
*NL*
confidence
that
she
would
be
able
to
manage
his
house
,
let
him
try
her
*NL*
this
time
,
and
he
would
find
by
experience
that
she
was
equal
to
greater
*NL*
responsibilities
.
Anselmo
replied
that
it
was
his
pleasure
to
have
it
so
,
*NL*
and
that
she
had
only
to
submit
and
obey
.
Camilla
said
she
would
do
so
,
*NL*
though
against
her
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
went
,
and
the
next
day
Lothario
came
to
his
house
,
where
he
was
*NL*
received
by
Camilla
with
a
friendly
and
modest
welcome
;
but
she
never
*NL*
suffered
Lothario
to
see
her
alone
,
for
she
was
always
attended
by
her
*NL*
men
and
women
servants
,
especially
by
a
handmaid
of
hers
,
Leonela
by
*NL*
name
,
to
whom
she
was
much
attached
-LRB-
for
they
had
been
brought
up
*NL*
together
from
childhood
in
her
father
's
house
-RRB-
,
and
whom
she
had
kept
*NL*
with
her
after
her
marriage
with
Anselmo
.
The
first
three
days
Lothario
*NL*
did
not
speak
to
her
,
though
he
might
have
done
so
when
they
removed
the
*NL*
cloth
and
the
servants
retired
to
dine
hastily
;
for
such
were
Camilla
's
*NL*
orders
;
nay
more
,
Leonela
had
directions
to
dine
earlier
than
Camilla
and
*NL*
never
to
leave
her
side
.
She
,
however
,
having
her
thoughts
fixed
upon
*NL*
other
things
more
to
her
taste
,
and
wanting
that
time
and
opportunity
for
*NL*
her
own
pleasures
,
did
not
always
obey
her
mistress
's
commands
,
but
on
*NL*
the
contrary
left
them
alone
,
as
if
they
had
ordered
her
to
do
so
;
but
*NL*
the
modest
bearing
of
Camilla
,
the
calmness
of
her
countenance
,
the
*NL*
composure
of
her
aspect
were
enough
to
bridle
the
tongue
of
Lothario
.
But
*NL*
the
influence
which
the
many
virtues
of
Camilla
exerted
in
imposing
*NL*
silence
on
Lothario
's
tongue
proved
mischievous
for
both
of
them
,
for
if
*NL*
his
tongue
was
silent
his
thoughts
were
busy
,
and
could
dwell
at
leisure
*NL*
upon
the
perfections
of
Camilla
's
goodness
and
beauty
one
by
one
,
charms
*NL*
enough
to
warm
with
love
a
marble
statue
,
not
to
say
a
heart
of
flesh
.
*NL*
Lothario
gazed
upon
her
when
he
might
have
been
speaking
to
her
,
and
*NL*
thought
how
worthy
of
being
loved
she
was
;
and
thus
reflection
began
*NL*
little
by
little
to
assail
his
allegiance
to
Anselmo
,
and
a
thousand
*NL*
times
he
thought
of
withdrawing
from
the
city
and
going
where
Anselmo
*NL*
should
never
see
him
nor
he
see
Camilla
.
But
already
the
delight
he
found
*NL*
in
gazing
on
her
interposed
and
held
him
fast
.
He
put
a
constraint
upon
*NL*
himself
,
and
struggled
to
repel
and
repress
the
pleasure
he
found
in
*NL*
contemplating
Camilla
;
when
alone
he
blamed
himself
for
his
weakness
,
*NL*
called
himself
a
bad
friend
,
nay
a
bad
Christian
;
then
he
argued
the
*NL*
matter
and
compared
himself
with
Anselmo
;
always
coming
to
the
conclusion
*NL*
that
the
folly
and
rashness
of
Anselmo
had
been
worse
than
his
*NL*
faithlessness
,
and
that
if
he
could
excuse
his
intentions
as
easily
*NL*
before
God
as
with
man
,
he
had
no
reason
to
fear
any
punishment
for
his
*NL*
offence
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
the
beauty
and
goodness
of
Camilla
,
joined
with
the
opportunity
*NL*
which
the
blind
husband
had
placed
in
his
hands
,
overthrew
the
loyalty
of
*NL*
Lothario
;
and
giving
heed
to
nothing
save
the
object
towards
which
his
*NL*
inclinations
led
him
,
after
Anselmo
had
been
three
days
absent
,
during
*NL*
which
he
had
been
carrying
on
a
continual
struggle
with
his
passion
,
he
*NL*
began
to
make
love
to
Camilla
with
so
much
vehemence
and
warmth
of
*NL*
language
that
she
was
overwhelmed
with
amazement
,
and
could
only
rise
*NL*
from
her
place
and
retire
to
her
room
without
answering
him
a
word
.
But
*NL*
the
hope
which
always
springs
up
with
love
was
not
weakened
in
Lothario
*NL*
by
this
repelling
demeanour
;
on
the
contrary
his
passion
for
Camilla
*NL*
increased
,
and
she
discovering
in
him
what
she
had
never
expected
,
knew
*NL*
not
what
to
do
;
and
considering
it
neither
safe
nor
right
to
give
him
the
*NL*
chance
or
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
again
,
she
resolved
to
send
,
as
*NL*
she
did
that
very
night
,
one
of
her
servants
with
a
letter
to
Anselmo
,
in
*NL*
which
she
addressed
the
following
words
to
him
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
IS
CONTINUED
THE
NOVEL
OF
``
THE
ILL-ADVISED
CURIOSITY
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
commonly
said
that
an
army
looks
ill
without
its
general
and
a
*NL*
castle
without
its
castellan
,
and
I
say
that
a
young
married
woman
looks
*NL*
still
worse
without
her
husband
unless
there
are
very
good
reasons
for
*NL*
it
.
I
find
myself
so
ill
at
ease
without
you
,
and
so
incapable
of
*NL*
enduring
this
separation
,
that
unless
you
return
quickly
I
shall
have
to
*NL*
go
for
relief
to
my
parents
'
house
,
even
if
I
leave
yours
without
a
*NL*
protector
;
for
the
one
you
left
me
,
if
indeed
he
deserved
that
title
,
*NL*
has
,
I
think
,
more
regard
to
his
own
pleasure
than
to
what
concerns
you
:
*NL*
as
you
are
possessed
of
discernment
I
need
say
no
more
to
you
,
nor
indeed
*NL*
is
it
fitting
I
should
say
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
received
this
letter
,
and
from
it
he
gathered
that
Lothario
had
*NL*
already
begun
his
task
and
that
Camilla
must
have
replied
to
him
as
he
*NL*
would
have
wished
;
and
delighted
beyond
measure
at
such
intelligence
he
*NL*
sent
word
to
her
not
to
leave
his
house
on
any
account
,
as
he
would
very
*NL*
shortly
return
.
Camilla
was
astonished
at
Anselmo
's
reply
,
which
placed
*NL*
her
in
greater
perplexity
than
before
,
for
she
neither
dared
to
remain
in
*NL*
her
own
house
,
nor
yet
to
go
to
her
parents
'
;
for
in
remaining
her
virtue
*NL*
was
imperilled
,
and
in
going
she
was
opposing
her
husband
's
commands
.
*NL*
Finally
she
decided
upon
what
was
the
worse
course
for
her
,
to
remain
,
*NL*
resolving
not
to
fly
from
the
presence
of
Lothario
,
that
she
might
not
*NL*
give
food
for
gossip
to
her
servants
;
and
she
now
began
to
regret
having
*NL*
written
as
she
had
to
her
husband
,
fearing
he
might
imagine
that
Lothario
*NL*
had
perceived
in
her
some
lightness
which
had
impelled
him
to
lay
aside
*NL*
the
respect
he
owed
her
;
but
confident
of
her
rectitude
she
put
her
trust
*NL*
in
God
and
in
her
own
virtuous
intentions
,
with
which
she
hoped
to
resist
*NL*
in
silence
all
the
solicitations
of
Lothario
,
without
saying
anything
to
*NL*
her
husband
so
as
not
to
involve
him
in
any
quarrel
or
trouble
;
and
she
*NL*
even
began
to
consider
how
to
excuse
Lothario
to
Anselmo
when
he
should
*NL*
ask
her
what
it
was
that
induced
her
to
write
that
letter
.
With
these
*NL*
resolutions
,
more
honourable
than
judicious
or
effectual
,
she
remained
*NL*
the
next
day
listening
to
Lothario
,
who
pressed
his
suit
so
strenuously
*NL*
that
Camilla
's
firmness
began
to
waver
,
and
her
virtue
had
enough
to
do
*NL*
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
her
eyes
and
keep
them
from
showing
signs
of
a
*NL*
certain
tender
compassion
which
the
tears
and
appeals
of
Lothario
had
*NL*
awakened
in
her
bosom
.
Lothario
observed
all
this
,
and
it
inflamed
him
*NL*
all
the
more
.
In
short
he
felt
that
while
Anselmo
's
absence
afforded
time
*NL*
and
opportunity
he
must
press
the
siege
of
the
fortress
,
and
so
he
*NL*
assailed
her
self-esteem
with
praises
of
her
beauty
,
for
there
is
nothing
*NL*
that
more
quickly
reduces
and
levels
the
castle
towers
of
fair
women
's
*NL*
vanity
than
vanity
itself
upon
the
tongue
of
flattery
.
In
fact
with
the
*NL*
utmost
assiduity
he
undermined
the
rock
of
her
purity
with
such
engines
*NL*
that
had
Camilla
been
of
brass
she
must
have
fallen
.
He
wept
,
he
*NL*
entreated
,
he
promised
,
he
flattered
,
he
importuned
,
he
pretended
with
so
*NL*
much
feeling
and
apparent
sincerity
,
that
he
overthrew
the
virtuous
*NL*
resolves
of
Camilla
and
won
the
triumph
he
least
expected
and
most
longed
*NL*
for
.
Camilla
yielded
,
Camilla
fell
;
but
what
wonder
if
the
friendship
of
*NL*
Lothario
could
not
stand
firm
?
A
clear
proof
to
us
that
the
passion
of
*NL*
love
is
to
be
conquered
only
by
flying
from
it
,
and
that
no
one
should
*NL*
engage
in
a
struggle
with
an
enemy
so
mighty
;
for
divine
strength
is
*NL*
needed
to
overcome
his
human
power
.
Leonela
alone
knew
of
her
mistress
's
*NL*
weakness
,
for
the
two
false
friends
and
new
lovers
were
unable
to
conceal
*NL*
it
.
Lothario
did
not
care
to
tell
Camilla
the
object
Anselmo
had
in
view
,
*NL*
nor
that
he
had
afforded
him
the
opportunity
of
attaining
such
a
result
,
*NL*
lest
she
should
undervalue
his
love
and
think
that
it
was
by
chance
and
*NL*
without
intending
it
and
not
of
his
own
accord
that
he
had
made
love
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
later
Anselmo
returned
to
his
house
and
did
not
perceive
what
*NL*
it
had
lost
,
that
which
he
so
lightly
treated
and
so
highly
prized
.
He
*NL*
went
at
once
to
see
Lothario
,
and
found
him
at
home
;
they
embraced
each
*NL*
other
,
and
Anselmo
asked
for
the
tidings
of
his
life
or
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tidings
I
have
to
give
thee
,
Anselmo
my
friend
,
''
said
Lothario
,
``
are
*NL*
that
thou
dost
possess
a
wife
that
is
worthy
to
be
the
pattern
and
crown
*NL*
of
all
good
wives
.
The
words
that
I
have
addressed
to
her
were
borne
away
*NL*
on
the
wind
,
my
promises
have
been
despised
,
my
presents
have
been
*NL*
refused
,
such
feigned
tears
as
I
shed
have
been
turned
into
open
*NL*
ridicule
.
In
short
,
as
Camilla
is
the
essence
of
all
beauty
,
so
is
she
*NL*
the
treasure-house
where
purity
dwells
,
and
gentleness
and
modesty
abide
*NL*
with
all
the
virtues
that
can
confer
praise
,
honour
,
and
happiness
upon
a
*NL*
woman
.
Take
back
thy
money
,
my
friend
;
here
it
is
,
and
I
have
had
no
need
*NL*
to
touch
it
,
for
the
chastity
of
Camilla
yields
not
to
things
so
base
as
*NL*
gifts
or
promises
.
Be
content
,
Anselmo
,
and
refrain
from
making
further
*NL*
proof
;
and
as
thou
hast
passed
dryshod
through
the
sea
of
those
doubts
*NL*
and
suspicions
that
are
and
may
be
entertained
of
women
,
seek
not
to
*NL*
plunge
again
into
the
deep
ocean
of
new
embarrassments
,
or
with
another
*NL*
pilot
make
trial
of
the
goodness
and
strength
of
the
bark
that
Heaven
has
*NL*
granted
thee
for
thy
passage
across
the
sea
of
this
world
;
but
reckon
*NL*
thyself
now
safe
in
port
,
moor
thyself
with
the
anchor
of
sound
*NL*
reflection
,
and
rest
in
peace
until
thou
art
called
upon
to
pay
that
debt
*NL*
which
no
nobility
on
earth
can
escape
paying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
was
completely
satisfied
by
the
words
of
Lothario
,
and
believed
*NL*
them
as
fully
as
if
they
had
been
spoken
by
an
oracle
;
nevertheless
he
*NL*
begged
of
him
not
to
relinquish
the
undertaking
,
were
it
but
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
curiosity
and
amusement
;
though
thenceforward
he
need
not
make
use
of
*NL*
the
same
earnest
endeavours
as
before
;
all
he
wished
him
to
do
was
to
*NL*
write
some
verses
to
her
,
praising
her
under
the
name
of
Chloris
,
for
he
*NL*
himself
would
give
her
to
understand
that
he
was
in
love
with
a
lady
to
*NL*
whom
he
had
given
that
name
to
enable
him
to
sing
her
praises
with
the
*NL*
decorum
due
to
her
modesty
;
and
if
Lothario
were
unwilling
to
take
the
*NL*
trouble
of
writing
the
verses
he
would
compose
them
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
not
be
necessary
,
''
said
Lothario
,
``
for
the
muses
are
not
such
*NL*
enemies
of
mine
but
that
they
visit
me
now
and
then
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
year
.
Do
thou
tell
Camilla
what
thou
hast
proposed
about
a
pretended
*NL*
amour
of
mine
;
as
for
the
verses
will
make
them
,
and
if
not
as
good
as
*NL*
the
subject
deserves
,
they
shall
be
at
least
the
best
I
can
produce
.
''
An
*NL*
agreement
to
this
effect
was
made
between
the
friends
,
the
ill-advised
*NL*
one
and
the
treacherous
,
and
Anselmo
returning
to
his
house
asked
Camilla
*NL*
the
question
she
already
wondered
he
had
not
asked
before
--
what
it
was
*NL*
that
had
caused
her
to
write
the
letter
she
had
sent
him
.
Camilla
replied
*NL*
that
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
Lothario
looked
at
her
somewhat
more
*NL*
freely
than
when
he
had
been
at
home
;
but
that
now
she
was
undeceived
and
*NL*
believed
it
to
have
been
only
her
own
imagination
,
for
Lothario
now
*NL*
avoided
seeing
her
,
or
being
alone
with
her
.
Anselmo
told
her
she
might
*NL*
be
quite
easy
on
the
score
of
that
suspicion
,
for
he
knew
that
Lothario
*NL*
was
in
love
with
a
damsel
of
rank
in
the
city
whom
he
celebrated
under
*NL*
the
name
of
Chloris
,
and
that
even
if
he
were
not
,
his
fidelity
and
their
*NL*
great
friendship
left
no
room
for
fear
.
Had
not
Camilla
,
however
,
been
*NL*
informed
beforehand
by
Lothario
that
this
love
for
Chloris
was
a
*NL*
pretence
,
and
that
he
himself
had
told
Anselmo
of
it
in
order
to
be
able
*NL*
sometimes
to
give
utterance
to
the
praises
of
Camilla
herself
,
no
doubt
*NL*
she
would
have
fallen
into
the
despairing
toils
of
jealousy
;
but
being
*NL*
forewarned
she
received
the
startling
news
without
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
as
the
three
were
at
table
Anselmo
asked
Lothario
to
recite
*NL*
something
of
what
he
had
composed
for
his
mistress
Chloris
;
for
as
*NL*
Camilla
did
not
know
her
,
he
might
safely
say
what
he
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
did
she
know
her
,
''
returned
Lothario
,
``
I
would
hide
nothing
,
for
*NL*
when
a
lover
praises
his
lady
's
beauty
,
and
charges
her
with
cruelty
,
he
*NL*
casts
no
imputation
upon
her
fair
name
;
at
any
rate
,
all
I
can
say
is
*NL*
that
yesterday
I
made
a
sonnet
on
the
ingratitude
of
this
Chloris
,
which
*NL*
goes
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
SONNET
*NL*
*NL*
At
midnight
,
in
the
silence
,
when
the
eyes
*NL*
Of
happier
mortals
balmy
slumbers
close
,
*NL*
The
weary
tale
of
my
unnumbered
woes
*NL*
To
Chloris
and
to
Heaven
is
wont
to
rise
.
*NL*
And
when
the
light
of
day
returning
dyes
*NL*
The
portals
of
the
east
with
tints
of
rose
,
*NL*
With
undiminished
force
my
sorrow
flows
*NL*
In
broken
accents
and
in
burning
sighs
.
*NL*
And
when
the
sun
ascends
his
star-girt
throne
,
*NL*
And
on
the
earth
pours
down
his
midday
beams
,
*NL*
Noon
but
renews
my
wailing
and
my
tears
;
*NL*
And
with
the
night
again
goes
up
my
moan
.
*NL*
Yet
ever
in
my
agony
it
seems
*NL*
To
me
that
neither
Heaven
nor
Chloris
hears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sonnet
pleased
Camilla
,
and
still
more
Anselmo
,
for
he
praised
it
and
*NL*
said
the
lady
was
excessively
cruel
who
made
no
return
for
sincerity
so
*NL*
manifest
.
On
which
Camilla
said
,
``
Then
all
that
love-smitten
poets
say
is
*NL*
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
poets
they
do
not
tell
the
truth
,
''
replied
Lothario
;
``
but
as
lovers
*NL*
they
are
not
more
defective
in
expression
than
they
are
truthful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
doubt
of
that
,
''
observed
Anselmo
,
anxious
to
support
and
*NL*
uphold
Lothario
's
ideas
with
Camilla
,
who
was
as
regardless
of
his
design
*NL*
as
she
was
deep
in
love
with
Lothario
;
and
so
taking
delight
in
anything
*NL*
that
was
his
,
and
knowing
that
his
thoughts
and
writings
had
her
for
*NL*
their
object
,
and
that
she
herself
was
the
real
Chloris
,
she
asked
him
to
*NL*
repeat
some
other
sonnet
or
verses
if
he
recollected
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
replied
Lothario
,
``
but
I
do
not
think
it
as
good
as
the
first
*NL*
one
,
or

SONNET
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
that
I
am
doomed
;
death
is
to
me
*NL*
As
certain
as
that
thou
,
ungrateful
fair
,
*NL*
Dead
at
thy
feet
shouldst
see
me
lying
,
ere
*NL*
My
heart
repented
of
its
love
for
thee

*NL*
If
buried
in
oblivion
I
should
be
,
*NL*
Bereft
of
life
,
fame
,
favour
,
even
there
*NL*
It
would
be
found
that
I
thy
image
bear
*NL*
Deep
graven
in
my
breast
for
all
to
see
.
*NL*
This
like
some
holy
relic
do
I
prize
*NL*
To
save
me
from
the
fate
my
truth
entails
,
*NL*
Truth
that
to
thy
hard
heart
its
vigour
owes
.
*NL*
Alas
for
him
that
under
lowering
skies
,
*NL*
In
peril
o'er
a
trackless
ocean
sails
,
*NL*
Where
neither
friendly
port
nor
pole-star
shows

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
praised
this
second
sonnet
too
,
as
he
had
praised
the
first
;
and
*NL*
so
he
went
on
adding
link
after
link
to
the
chain
with
which
he
was
*NL*
binding
himself
and
making
his
dishonour
secure
;
for
when
Lothario
was
*NL*
doing
most
to
dishonour
him
he
told
him
he
was
most
honoured
;
and
thus
*NL*
each
step
that
Camilla
descended
towards
the
depths
of
her
abasement
,
she
*NL*
mounted
,
in
his
opinion
,
towards
the
summit
of
virtue
and
fair
fame
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
finding
herself
on
one
occasion
alone
with
her
maid
,
*NL*
Camilla
said
to
her
,
``
I
am
ashamed
to
think
,
my
dear
Leonela
,
how
lightly
*NL*
I
have
valued
myself
that
I
did
not
compel
Lothario
to
purchase
by
at
*NL*
least
some
expenditure
of
time
that
full
possession
of
me
that
I
so
*NL*
quickly
yielded
him
of
my
own
free
will
.
I
fear
that
he
will
think
ill
of
*NL*
my
pliancy
or
lightness
,
not
considering
the
irresistible
influence
he
*NL*
brought
to
bear
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
not
that
trouble
you
,
my
lady
,
''
said
Leonela
,
``
for
it
does
not
take
*NL*
away
the
value
of
the
thing
given
or
make
it
the
less
precious
to
give
it
*NL*
quickly
if
it
be
really
valuable
and
worthy
of
being
prized
;
nay
,
they
*NL*
are
wont
to
say
that
he
who
gives
quickly
gives
twice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
also
,
''
said
Camilla
,
``
that
what
costs
little
is
valued
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
saying
does
not
hold
good
in
your
case
,
''
replied
Leonela
,
``
for
*NL*
love
,
as
I
have
heard
say
,
sometimes
flies
and
sometimes
walks
;
with
this
*NL*
one
it
runs
,
with
that
it
moves
slowly
;
some
it
cools
,
others
it
burns
;
*NL*
some
it
wounds
,
others
it
slays
;
it
begins
the
course
of
its
desires
,
and
*NL*
at
the
same
moment
completes
and
ends
it
;
in
the
morning
it
will
lay
*NL*
siege
to
a
fortress
and
by
night
will
have
taken
it
,
for
there
is
no
*NL*
power
that
can
resist
it
;
so
what
are
you
in
dread
of
,
what
do
you
fear
,
*NL*
when
the
same
must
have
befallen
Lothario
,
love
having
chosen
the
absence
*NL*
of
my
lord
as
the
instrument
for
subduing
you
?
and
it
was
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
to
complete
then
what
love
had
resolved
upon
,
without
affording
*NL*
the
time
to
let
Anselmo
return
and
by
his
presence
compel
the
work
to
be
*NL*
left
unfinished
;
for
love
has
no
better
agent
for
carrying
out
his
*NL*
designs
than
opportunity
;
and
of
opportunity
he
avails
himself
in
all
his
*NL*
feats
,
especially
at
the
outset
.
All
this
I
know
well
myself
,
more
by
*NL*
experience
than
by
hearsay
,
and
some
day
,
senora
,
I
will
enlighten
you
on
*NL*
the
subject
,
for
I
am
of
your
flesh
and
blood
too
.
Moreover
,
lady
*NL*
Camilla
,
you
did
not
surrender
yourself
or
yield
so
quickly
but
that
*NL*
first
you
saw
Lothario
's
whole
soul
in
his
eyes
,
in
his
sighs
,
in
his
*NL*
words
,
his
promises
and
his
gifts
,
and
by
it
and
his
good
qualities
*NL*
perceived
how
worthy
he
was
of
your
love
.
This
,
then
,
being
the
case
,
let
*NL*
not
these
scrupulous
and
prudish
ideas
trouble
your
imagination
,
but
be
*NL*
assured
that
Lothario
prizes
you
as
you
do
him
,
and
rest
content
and
*NL*
satisfied
that
as
you
are
caught
in
the
noose
of
love
it
is
one
of
worth
*NL*
and
merit
that
has
taken
you
,
and
one
that
has
not
only
the
four
S
's
that
*NL*
they
say
true
lovers
ought
to
have
,
but
a
complete
alphabet
;
only
listen
*NL*
to
me
and
you
will
see
how
I
can
repeat
it
by
rote
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
Camilla
laughed
at
her
maid
's
alphabet
,
and
perceived
her
to
be
more
*NL*
experienced
in
love
affairs
than
she
said
,
which
she
admitted
,
confessing
*NL*
to
Camilla
that
she
had
love
passages
with
a
young
man
of
good
birth
of
*NL*
the
same
city
.
Camilla
was
uneasy
at
this
,
dreading
lest
it
might
prove
*NL*
the
means
of
endangering
her
honour
,
and
asked
whether
her
intrigue
had
*NL*
gone
beyond
words
,
and
she
with
little
shame
and
much
effrontery
said
it
*NL*
had
;
for
certain
it
is
that
ladies
'
imprudences
make
servants
shameless
,
*NL*
who
,
when
they
see
their
mistresses
make
a
false
step
,
think
nothing
of
*NL*
going
astray
themselves
,
or
of
its
being
known
.
All
that
Camilla
could
do
*NL*
was
to
entreat
Leonela
to
say
nothing
about
her
doings
to
him
whom
she
*NL*
called
her
lover
,
and
to
conduct
her
own
affairs
secretly
lest
they
*NL*
should
come
to
the
knowledge
of
Anselmo
or
of
Lothario
.
Leonela
said
she
*NL*
would
,
but
kept
her
word
in
such
a
way
that
she
confirmed
Camilla
's
*NL*
apprehension
of
losing
her
reputation
through
her
means
;
for
this
*NL*
abandoned
and
bold
Leonela
,
as
soon
as
she
perceived
that
her
mistress
's
*NL*
demeanour
was
not
what
it
was
wont
to
be
,
had
the
audacity
to
introduce
*NL*
her
lover
into
the
house
,
confident
that
even
if
her
mistress
saw
him
she
*NL*
would
not
dare
to
expose
him
;
for
the
sins
of
mistresses
entail
this
*NL*
mischief
among
others
;
they
make
themselves
the
slaves
of
their
own
*NL*
servants
,
and
are
obliged
to
hide
their
laxities
and
depravities
;
as
was
*NL*
the
case
with
Camilla
,
who
though
she
perceived
,
not
once
but
many
times
,
*NL*
that
Leonela
was
with
her
lover
in
some
room
of
the
house
,
not
only
did
*NL*
not
dare
to
chide
her
,
but
afforded
her
opportunities
for
concealing
him
*NL*
and
removed
all
difficulties
,
lest
he
should
be
seen
by
her
husband
.
She
*NL*
was
unable
,
however
,
to
prevent
him
from
being
seen
on
one
occasion
,
as
*NL*
he
sallied
forth
at
daybreak
,
by
Lothario
,
who
,
not
knowing
who
he
was
,
*NL*
at
first
took
him
for
a
spectre
;
but
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
hasten
away
,
*NL*
muffling
his
face
with
his
cloak
and
concealing
himself
carefully
and
*NL*
cautiously
,
he
rejected
this
foolish
idea
,
and
adopted
another
,
which
*NL*
would
have
been
the
ruin
of
all
had
not
Camilla
found
a
remedy
.
It
did
*NL*
not
occur
to
Lothario
that
this
man
he
had
seen
issuing
at
such
an
*NL*
untimely
hour
from
Anselmo
's
house
could
have
entered
it
on
Leonela
's
*NL*
account
,
nor
did
he
even
remember
there
was
such
a
person
as
Leonela
;
all
*NL*
he
thought
was
that
as
Camilla
had
been
light
and
yielding
with
him
,
so
*NL*
she
had
been
with
another
;
for
this
further
penalty
the
erring
woman
's
*NL*
sin
brings
with
it
,
that
her
honour
is
distrusted
even
by
him
to
whose
*NL*
overtures
and
persuasions
she
has
yielded
;
and
he
believes
her
to
have
*NL*
surrendered
more
easily
to
others
,
and
gives
implicit
credence
to
every
*NL*
suspicion
that
comes
into
his
mind
.
All
Lothario
's
good
sense
seems
to
*NL*
have
failed
him
at
this
juncture
;
all
his
prudent
maxims
escaped
his
*NL*
memory
;
for
without
once
reflecting
rationally
,
and
without
more
ado
,
in
*NL*
his
impatience
and
in
the
blindness
of
the
jealous
rage
that
gnawed
his
*NL*
heart
,
and
dying
to
revenge
himself
upon
Camilla
,
who
had
done
him
no
*NL*
wrong
,
before
Anselmo
had
risen
he
hastened
to
him
and
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Know
,
Anselmo
,
that
for
several
days
past
I
have
been
struggling
with
*NL*
myself
,
striving
to
withhold
from
thee
what
it
is
no
longer
possible
or
*NL*
right
that
I
should
conceal
from
thee
.
Know
that
Camilla
's
fortress
has
*NL*
surrendered
and
is
ready
to
submit
to
my
will
;
and
if
I
have
been
slow
to
*NL*
reveal
this
fact
to
thee
,
it
was
in
order
to
see
if
it
were
some
light
*NL*
caprice
of
hers
,
or
if
she
sought
to
try
me
and
ascertain
if
the
love
I
*NL*
began
to
make
to
her
with
thy
permission
was
made
with
a
serious
*NL*
intention
.
I
thought
,
too
,
that
she
,
if
she
were
what
she
ought
to
be
,
*NL*
and
what
we
both
believed
her
,
would
have
ere
this
given
thee
information
*NL*
of
my
addresses
;
but
seeing
that
she
delays
,
I
believe
the
truth
of
the
*NL*
promise
she
has
given
me
that
the
next
time
thou
art
absent
from
the
*NL*
house
she
will
grant
me
an
interview
in
the
closet
where
thy
jewels
are
*NL*
kept
-LRB-
and
it
was
true
that
Camilla
used
to
meet
him
there
-RRB-
;
but
I
do
not
*NL*
wish
thee
to
rush
precipitately
to
take
vengeance
,
for
the
sin
is
as
yet
*NL*
only
committed
in
intention
,
and
Camilla
's
may
change
perhaps
between
*NL*
this
and
the
appointed
time
,
and
repentance
spring
up
in
its
place
.
As
*NL*
hitherto
thou
hast
always
followed
my
advice
wholly
or
in
part
,
follow
*NL*
and
observe
this
that
I
will
give
thee
now
,
so
that
,
without
mistake
,
and
*NL*
with
mature
deliberation
,
thou
mayest
satisfy
thyself
as
to
what
may
seem
*NL*
the
best
course
;
pretend
to
absent
thyself
for
two
or
three
days
as
thou
*NL*
hast
been
wont
to
do
on
other
occasions
,
and
contrive
to
hide
thyself
in
*NL*
the
closet
;
for
the
tapestries
and
other
things
there
afford
great
*NL*
facilities
for
thy
concealment
,
and
then
thou
wilt
see
with
thine
own
*NL*
eyes
and
I
with
mine
what
Camilla
's
purpose
may
be
.
And
if
it
be
a
guilty
*NL*
one
,
which
may
be
feared
rather
than
expected
,
with
silence
,
prudence
,
*NL*
and
discretion
thou
canst
thyself
become
the
instrument
of
punishment
for
*NL*
the
wrong
done
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
was
amazed
,
overwhelmed
,
and
astounded
at
the
words
of
Lothario
,
*NL*
which
came
upon
him
at
a
time
when
he
least
expected
to
hear
them
,
for
he
*NL*
now
looked
upon
Camilla
as
having
triumphed
over
the
pretended
attacks
of
*NL*
Lothario
,
and
was
beginning
to
enjoy
the
glory
of
her
victory
.
He
*NL*
remained
silent
for
a
considerable
time
,
looking
on
the
ground
with
fixed
*NL*
gaze
,
and
at
length
said
,
``
Thou
hast
behaved
,
Lothario
,
as
I
expected
of
*NL*
thy
friendship
:
I
will
follow
thy
advice
in
everything
;
do
as
thou
wilt
,
*NL*
and
keep
this
secret
as
thou
seest
it
should
be
kept
in
circumstances
so
*NL*
unlooked
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lothario
gave
him
his
word
,
but
after
leaving
him
he
repented
altogether
*NL*
of
what
he
had
said
to
him
,
perceiving
how
foolishly
he
had
acted
,
as
he
*NL*
might
have
revenged
himself
upon
Camilla
in
some
less
cruel
and
degrading
*NL*
way
.
He
cursed
his
want
of
sense
,
condemned
his
hasty
resolution
,
and
*NL*
knew
not
what
course
to
take
to
undo
the
mischief
or
find
some
ready
*NL*
escape
from
it
.
At
last
he
decided
upon
revealing
all
to
Camilla
,
and
,
as
*NL*
there
was
no
want
of
opportunity
for
doing
so
,
he
found
her
alone
the
*NL*
same
day
;
but
she
,
as
soon
as
she
had
the
chance
of
speaking
to
him
,
*NL*
said
,
``
Lothario
my
friend
,
I
must
tell
thee
I
have
a
sorrow
in
my
heart
*NL*
which
fills
it
so
that
it
seems
ready
to
burst
;
and
it
will
be
a
wonder
*NL*
if
it
does
not
;
for
the
audacity
of
Leonela
has
now
reached
such
a
pitch
*NL*
that
every
night
she
conceals
a
gallant
of
hers
in
this
house
and
remains
*NL*
with
him
till
morning
,
at
the
expense
of
my
reputation
;
inasmuch
as
it
is
*NL*
open
to
anyone
to
question
it
who
may
see
him
quitting
my
house
at
such
*NL*
unseasonable
hours
;
but
what
distresses
me
is
that
I
can
not
punish
or
*NL*
chide
her
,
for
her
privity
to
our
intrigue
bridles
my
mouth
and
keeps
me
*NL*
silent
about
hers
,
while
I
am
dreading
that
some
catastrophe
will
come
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Camilla
said
this
Lothario
at
first
imagined
it
was
some
device
to
*NL*
delude
him
into
the
idea
that
the
man
he
had
seen
going
out
was
Leonela
's
*NL*
lover
and
not
hers
;
but
when
he
saw
how
she
wept
and
suffered
,
and
begged
*NL*
him
to
help
her
,
he
became
convinced
of
the
truth
,
and
the
conviction
*NL*
completed
his
confusion
and
remorse
;
however
,
he
told
Camilla
not
to
*NL*
distress
herself
,
as
he
would
take
measures
to
put
a
stop
to
the
*NL*
insolence
of
Leonela
.
At
the
same
time
he
told
her
what
,
driven
by
the
*NL*
fierce
rage
of
jealousy
,
he
had
said
to
Anselmo
,
and
how
he
had
arranged
*NL*
to
hide
himself
in
the
closet
that
he
might
there
see
plainly
how
little
*NL*
she
preserved
her
fidelity
to
him
;
and
he
entreated
her
pardon
for
this
*NL*
madness
,
and
her
advice
as
to
how
to
repair
it
,
and
escape
safely
from
*NL*
the
intricate
labyrinth
in
which
his
imprudence
had
involved
him
.
Camilla
*NL*
was
struck
with
alarm
at
hearing
what
Lothario
said
,
and
with
much
anger
,
*NL*
and
great
good
sense
,
she
reproved
him
and
rebuked
his
base
design
and
*NL*
the
foolish
and
mischievous
resolution
he
had
made
;
but
as
woman
has
by
*NL*
nature
a
nimbler
wit
than
man
for
good
and
for
evil
,
though
it
is
apt
to
*NL*
fail
when
she
sets
herself
deliberately
to
reason
,
Camilla
on
the
spur
of
*NL*
the
moment
thought
of
a
way
to
remedy
what
was
to
all
appearance
*NL*
irremediable
,
and
told
Lothario
to
contrive
that
the
next
day
Anselmo
*NL*
should
conceal
himself
in
the
place
he
mentioned
,
for
she
hoped
from
his
*NL*
concealment
to
obtain
the
means
of
their
enjoying
themselves
for
the
*NL*
future
without
any
apprehension
;
and
without
revealing
her
purpose
to
him
*NL*
entirely
she
charged
him
to
be
careful
,
as
soon
as
Anselmo
was
concealed
,
*NL*
to
come
to
her
when
Leonela
should
call
him
,
and
to
all
she
said
to
him
*NL*
to
answer
as
he
would
have
answered
had
he
not
known
that
Anselmo
was
*NL*
listening
.
Lothario
pressed
her
to
explain
her
intention
fully
,
so
that
*NL*
he
might
with
more
certainty
and
precaution
take
care
to
do
what
he
saw
*NL*
to
be
needful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
''
said
Camilla
,
``
there
is
nothing
to
take
care
of
except
to
*NL*
answer
me
what
I
shall
ask
you
;
''
for
she
did
not
wish
to
explain
to
him
*NL*
beforehand
what
she
meant
to
do
,
fearing
lest
he
should
be
unwilling
to
*NL*
follow
out
an
idea
which
seemed
to
her
such
a
good
one
,
and
should
try
or
*NL*
devise
some
other
less
practicable
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lothario
then
retired
,
and
the
next
day
Anselmo
,
under
pretence
of
going
*NL*
to
his
friend
's
country
house
,
took
his
departure
,
and
then
returned
to
*NL*
conceal
himself
,
which
he
was
able
to
do
easily
,
as
Camilla
and
Leonela
*NL*
took
care
to
give
him
the
opportunity
;
and
so
he
placed
himself
in
hiding
*NL*
in
the
state
of
agitation
that
it
may
be
imagined
he
would
feel
who
*NL*
expected
to
see
the
vitals
of
his
honour
laid
bare
before
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
found
himself
on
the
point
of
losing
the
supreme
blessing
he
thought
he
*NL*
possessed
in
his
beloved
Camilla
.
Having
made
sure
of
Anselmo
's
being
in
*NL*
his
hiding-place
,
Camilla
and
Leonela
entered
the
closet
,
and
the
instant
*NL*
she
set
foot
within
it
Camilla
said
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
``
Ah
!
dear
Leonela
,
*NL*
would
it
not
be
better
,
before
I
do
what
I
am
unwilling
you
should
know
*NL*
lest
you
should
seek
to
prevent
it
,
that
you
should
take
Anselmo
's
dagger
*NL*
that
I
have
asked
of
you
and
with
it
pierce
this
vile
heart
of
mine
?
But
*NL*
no
;
there
is
no
reason
why
I
should
suffer
the
punishment
of
another
's
*NL*
fault
.
I
will
first
know
what
it
is
that
the
bold
licentious
eyes
of
*NL*
Lothario
have
seen
in
me
that
could
have
encouraged
him
to
reveal
to
me
a
*NL*
design
so
base
as
that
which
he
has
disclosed
regardless
of
his
friend
*NL*
and
of
my
honour
.
Go
to
the
window
,
Leonela
,
and
call
him
,
for
no
doubt
*NL*
he
is
in
the
street
waiting
to
carry
out
his
vile
project
;
but
mine
,
*NL*
cruel
it
may
be
,
but
honourable
,
shall
be
carried
out
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
senora
,
''
said
the
crafty
Leonela
,
who
knew
her
part
,
``
what
is
it
you
*NL*
want
to
do
with
this
dagger
?
Can
it
be
that
you
mean
to
take
your
own
*NL*
life
,
or
Lothario
's
?
for
whichever
you
mean
to
do
,
it
will
lead
to
the
*NL*
loss
of
your
reputation
and
good
name
.
It
is
better
to
dissemble
your
*NL*
wrong
and
not
give
this
wicked
man
the
chance
of
entering
the
house
now
*NL*
and
finding
us
alone
;
consider
,
senora
,
we
are
weak
women
and
he
is
a
*NL*
man
,
and
determined
,
and
as
he
comes
with
such
a
base
purpose
,
blind
and
*NL*
urged
by
passion
,
perhaps
before
you
can
put
yours
into
execution
he
may
*NL*
do
what
will
be
worse
for
you
than
taking
your
life
.
Ill
betide
my
*NL*
master
,
Anselmo
,
for
giving
such
authority
in
his
house
to
this
shameless
*NL*
fellow
!
And
supposing
you
kill
him
,
senora
,
as
I
suspect
you
mean
to
do
,
*NL*
what
shall
we
do
with
him
when
he
is
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
my
friend
?
''
replied
Camilla
,
``
we
shall
leave
him
for
Anselmo
to
*NL*
bury
him
;
for
in
reason
it
will
be
to
him
a
light
labour
to
hide
his
own
*NL*
infamy
under
ground
.
Summon
him
,
make
haste
,
for
all
the
time
I
delay
in
*NL*
taking
vengeance
for
my
wrong
seems
to
me
an
offence
against
the
loyalty
*NL*
I
owe
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
was
listening
to
all
this
,
and
every
word
that
Camilla
uttered
*NL*
made
him
change
his
mind
;
but
when
he
heard
that
it
was
resolved
to
kill
*NL*
Lothario
his
first
impulse
was
to
come
out
and
show
himself
to
avert
such
*NL*
a
disaster
;
but
in
his
anxiety
to
see
the
issue
of
a
resolution
so
bold
*NL*
and
virtuous
he
restrained
himself
,
intending
to
come
forth
in
time
to
*NL*
prevent
the
deed
.
At
this
moment
Camilla
,
throwing
herself
upon
a
bed
*NL*
that
was
close
by
,
swooned
away
,
and
Leonela
began
to
weep
bitterly
,
*NL*
exclaiming
,
``
Woe
is
me
!
that
I
should
be
fated
to
have
dying
here
in
my
*NL*
arms
the
flower
of
virtue
upon
earth
,
the
crown
of
true
wives
,
the
*NL*
pattern
of
chastity
!
''
with
more
to
the
same
effect
,
so
that
anyone
who
*NL*
heard
her
would
have
taken
her
for
the
most
tender-hearted
and
faithful
*NL*
handmaid
in
the
world
,
and
her
mistress
for
another
persecuted
Penelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Camilla
was
not
long
in
recovering
from
her
fainting
fit
and
on
coming
to
*NL*
herself
she
said
,
``
Why
do
you
not
go
,
Leonela
,
to
call
hither
that
*NL*
friend
,
the
falsest
to
his
friend
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
or
night
*NL*
concealed
?
Away
,
run
,
haste
,
speed
!
lest
the
fire
of
my
wrath
burn
itself
*NL*
out
with
delay
,
and
the
righteous
vengeance
that
I
hope
for
melt
away
in
*NL*
menaces
and
maledictions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
just
going
to
call
him
,
senora
,
''
said
Leonela
;
``
but
you
must
first
*NL*
give
me
that
dagger
,
lest
while
I
am
gone
you
should
by
means
of
it
give
*NL*
cause
to
all
who
love
you
to
weep
all
their
lives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
in
peace
,
dear
Leonela
,
I
will
not
do
so
,
''
said
Camilla
,
``
for
rash
*NL*
and
foolish
as
I
may
be
,
to
your
mind
,
in
defending
my
honour
,
I
am
not
*NL*
going
to
be
so
much
so
as
that
Lucretia
who
they
say
killed
herself
*NL*
without
having
done
anything
wrong
,
and
without
having
first
killed
him
*NL*
on
whom
the
guilt
of
her
misfortune
lay
.
I
shall
die
,
if
I
am
to
die
;
but
*NL*
it
must
be
after
full
vengeance
upon
him
who
has
brought
me
here
to
weep
*NL*
over
audacity
that
no
fault
of
mine
gave
birth
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonela
required
much
pressing
before
she
would
go
to
summon
Lothario
,
*NL*
but
at
last
she
went
,
and
while
awaiting
her
return
Camilla
continued
,
as
*NL*
if
speaking
to
herself
,
``
Good
God
!
would
it
not
have
been
more
prudent
to
*NL*
have
repulsed
Lothario
,
as
I
have
done
many
a
time
before
,
than
to
allow
*NL*
him
,
as
I
am
now
doing
,
to
think
me
unchaste
and
vile
,
even
for
the
short
*NL*
time
I
must
wait
until
I
undeceive
him
?
No
doubt
it
would
have
been
*NL*
better
;
but
I
should
not
be
avenged
,
nor
the
honour
of
my
husband
*NL*
vindicated
,
should
he
find
so
clear
and
easy
an
escape
from
the
strait
*NL*
into
which
his
depravity
has
led
him
.
Let
the
traitor
pay
with
his
life
*NL*
for
the
temerity
of
his
wanton
wishes
,
and
let
the
world
know
-LRB-
if
haply
*NL*
it
shall
ever
come
to
know
-RRB-
that
Camilla
not
only
preserved
her
*NL*
allegiance
to
her
husband
,
but
avenged
him
of
the
man
who
dared
to
wrong
*NL*
him
.
Still
,
I
think
it
might
be
better
to
disclose
this
to
Anselmo
.
But
*NL*
then
I
have
called
his
attention
to
it
in
the
letter
I
wrote
to
him
in
*NL*
the
country
,
and
,
if
he
did
nothing
to
prevent
the
mischief
I
there
*NL*
pointed
out
to
him
,
I
suppose
it
was
that
from
pure
goodness
of
heart
and
*NL*
trustfulness
he
would
not
and
could
not
believe
that
any
thought
against
*NL*
his
honour
could
harbour
in
the
breast
of
so
stanch
a
friend
;
nor
indeed
*NL*
did
I
myself
believe
it
for
many
days
,
nor
should
I
have
ever
believed
it
*NL*
if
his
insolence
had
not
gone
so
far
as
to
make
it
manifest
by
open
*NL*
presents
,
lavish
promises
,
and
ceaseless
tears
.
But
why
do
I
argue
thus
?
*NL*
Does
a
bold
determination
stand
in
need
of
arguments
?
Surely
not
.
Then
*NL*
traitors
avaunt
!
Vengeance
to
my
aid
!
Let
the
false
one
come
,
approach
,
*NL*
advance
,
die
,
yield
up
his
life
,
and
then
befall
what
may
.
Pure
I
came
to
*NL*
him
whom
Heaven
bestowed
upon
me
,
pure
I
shall
leave
him
;
and
at
the
*NL*
worst
bathed
in
my
own
chaste
blood
and
in
the
foul
blood
of
the
falsest
*NL*
friend
that
friendship
ever
saw
in
the
world
;
''
and
as
she
uttered
these
*NL*
words
she
paced
the
room
holding
the
unsheathed
dagger
,
with
such
*NL*
irregular
and
disordered
steps
,
and
such
gestures
that
one
would
have
*NL*
supposed
her
to
have
lost
her
senses
,
and
taken
her
for
some
violent
*NL*
desperado
instead
of
a
delicate
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
,
hidden
behind
some
tapestries
where
he
had
concealed
himself
,
*NL*
beheld
and
was
amazed
at
all
,
and
already
felt
that
what
he
had
seen
and
*NL*
heard
was
a
sufficient
answer
to
even
greater
suspicions
;
and
he
would
*NL*
have
been
now
well
pleased
if
the
proof
afforded
by
Lothario
's
coming
*NL*
were
dispensed
with
,
as
he
feared
some
sudden
mishap
;
but
as
he
was
on
*NL*
the
point
of
showing
himself
and
coming
forth
to
embrace
and
undeceive
*NL*
his
wife
he
paused
as
he
saw
Leonela
returning
,
leading
Lothario
.
Camilla
*NL*
when
she
saw
him
,
drawing
a
long
line
in
front
of
her
on
the
floor
with
*NL*
the
dagger
,
said
to
him
,
``
Lothario
,
pay
attention
to
what
I
say
to
thee
:
*NL*
if
by
any
chance
thou
darest
to
cross
this
line
thou
seest
,
or
even
*NL*
approach
it
,
the
instant
I
see
thee
attempt
it
that
same
instant
will
I
*NL*
pierce
my
bosom
with
this
dagger
that
I
hold
in
my
hand
;
and
before
thou
*NL*
answerest
me
a
word
desire
thee
to
listen
to
a
few
from
me
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
thou
shalt
reply
as
may
please
thee
.
First
,
I
desire
thee
to
*NL*
tell
me
,
Lothario
,
if
thou
knowest
my
husband
Anselmo
,
and
in
what
light
*NL*
thou
regardest
him
;
and
secondly
I
desire
to
know
if
thou
knowest
me
too
.
*NL*
Answer
me
this
,
without
embarrassment
or
reflecting
deeply
what
thou
wilt
*NL*
answer
,
for
they
are
no
riddles
I
put
to
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lothario
was
not
so
dull
but
that
from
the
first
moment
when
Camilla
*NL*
directed
him
to
make
Anselmo
hide
himself
he
understood
what
she
intended
*NL*
to
do
,
and
therefore
he
fell
in
with
her
idea
so
readily
and
promptly
*NL*
that
between
them
they
made
the
imposture
look
more
true
than
truth
;
so
*NL*
he
answered
her
thus
:
``
I
did
not
think
,
fair
Camilla
,
that
thou
wert
*NL*
calling
me
to
ask
questions
so
remote
from
the
object
with
which
I
come
;
*NL*
but
if
it
is
to
defer
the
promised
reward
thou
art
doing
so
,
thou
mightst
*NL*
have
put
it
off
still
longer
,
for
the
longing
for
happiness
gives
the
*NL*
more
distress
the
nearer
comes
the
hope
of
gaining
it
;
but
lest
thou
*NL*
shouldst
say
that
I
do
not
answer
thy
questions
,
I
say
that
I
know
thy
*NL*
husband
Anselmo
,
and
that
we
have
known
each
other
from
our
earliest
*NL*
years
;
I
will
not
speak
of
what
thou
too
knowest
,
of
our
friendship
,
that
*NL*
I
may
not
compel
myself
to
testify
against
the
wrong
that
love
,
the
*NL*
mighty
excuse
for
greater
errors
,
makes
me
inflict
upon
him
.
Thee
I
know
*NL*
and
hold
in
the
same
estimation
as
he
does
,
for
were
it
not
so
I
had
not
*NL*
for
a
lesser
prize
acted
in
opposition
to
what
I
owe
to
my
station
and
*NL*
the
holy
laws
of
true
friendship
,
now
broken
and
violated
by
me
through
*NL*
that
powerful
enemy
,
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
thou
dost
confess
that
,
''
returned
Camilla
,
``
mortal
enemy
of
all
that
*NL*
rightly
deserves
to
be
loved
,
with
what
face
dost
thou
dare
to
come
*NL*
before
one
whom
thou
knowest
to
be
the
mirror
wherein
he
is
reflected
on
*NL*
whom
thou
shouldst
look
to
see
how
unworthily
thou
him
?
But
,
woe
is
me
,
I
*NL*
now
comprehend
what
has
made
thee
give
so
little
heed
to
what
thou
owest
*NL*
to
thyself
;
it
must
have
been
some
freedom
of
mine
,
for
I
will
not
call
*NL*
it
immodesty
,
as
it
did
not
proceed
from
any
deliberate
intention
,
but
*NL*
from
some
heedlessness
such
as
women
are
guilty
of
through
inadvertence
*NL*
when
they
think
they
have
no
occasion
for
reserve
.
But
tell
me
,
traitor
,
*NL*
when
did
I
by
word
or
sign
give
a
reply
to
thy
prayers
that
could
awaken
*NL*
in
thee
a
shadow
of
hope
of
attaining
thy
base
wishes
?
When
were
not
thy
*NL*
professions
of
love
sternly
and
scornfully
rejected
and
rebuked
?
When
*NL*
were
thy
frequent
pledges
and
still
more
frequent
gifts
believed
or
*NL*
accepted
?
But
as
I
am
persuaded
that
no
one
can
long
persevere
in
the
*NL*
attempt
to
win
love
unsustained
by
some
hope
,
I
am
willing
to
attribute
*NL*
to
myself
the
blame
of
thy
assurance
,
for
no
doubt
some
thoughtlessness
*NL*
of
mine
has
all
this
time
fostered
thy
hopes
;
and
therefore
will
I
punish
*NL*
myself
and
inflict
upon
myself
the
penalty
thy
guilt
deserves
.
And
that
*NL*
thou
mayest
see
that
being
so
relentless
to
myself
I
can
not
possibly
be
*NL*
otherwise
to
thee
,
I
have
summoned
thee
to
be
a
witness
of
the
sacrifice
*NL*
I
mean
to
offer
to
the
injured
honour
of
my
honoured
husband
,
wronged
by
*NL*
thee
with
all
the
assiduity
thou
wert
capable
of
,
and
by
me
too
through
*NL*
want
of
caution
in
avoiding
every
occasion
,
if
I
have
given
any
,
of
*NL*
encouraging
and
sanctioning
thy
base
designs
.
Once
more
I
say
the
*NL*
suspicion
in
my
mind
that
some
imprudence
of
mine
has
engendered
these
*NL*
lawless
thoughts
in
thee
,
is
what
causes
me
most
distress
and
what
I
*NL*
desire
most
to
punish
with
my
own
hands
,
for
were
any
other
instrument
of
*NL*
punishment
employed
my
error
might
become
perhaps
more
widely
known
;
but
*NL*
before
I
do
so
,
in
my
death
I
mean
to
inflict
death
,
and
take
with
me
one
*NL*
that
will
fully
satisfy
my
longing
for
the
revenge
I
hope
for
and
have
;
*NL*
for
I
shall
see
,
wheresoever
it
may
be
that
I
go
,
the
penalty
awarded
by
*NL*
inflexible
,
unswerving
justice
on
him
who
has
placed
me
in
a
position
so
*NL*
desperate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
uttered
these
words
,
with
incredible
energy
and
swiftness
she
flew
*NL*
upon
Lothario
with
the
naked
dagger
,
so
manifestly
bent
on
burying
it
in
*NL*
his
breast
that
he
was
almost
uncertain
whether
these
demonstrations
were
*NL*
real
or
feigned
,
for
he
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
all
his
skill
and
*NL*
strength
to
prevent
her
from
striking
him
;
and
with
such
reality
did
she
*NL*
act
this
strange
farce
and
mystification
that
,
to
give
it
a
colour
of
*NL*
truth
,
she
determined
to
stain
it
with
her
own
blood
;
for
perceiving
,
or
*NL*
pretending
,
that
she
could
not
wound
Lothario
,
she
said
,
``
Fate
,
it
seems
,
*NL*
will
not
grant
my
just
desire
complete
satisfaction
,
but
it
will
not
be
*NL*
able
to
keep
me
from
satisfying
it
partially
at
least
;
''
and
making
an
*NL*
effort
to
free
the
hand
with
the
dagger
which
Lothario
held
in
his
grasp
,
*NL*
she
released
it
,
and
directing
the
point
to
a
place
where
it
could
not
*NL*
inflict
a
deep
wound
,
she
plunged
it
into
her
left
side
high
up
close
to
*NL*
the
shoulder
,
and
then
allowed
herself
to
fall
to
the
ground
as
if
in
a
*NL*
faint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonela
and
Lothario
stood
amazed
and
astounded
at
the
catastrophe
,
and
*NL*
seeing
Camilla
stretched
on
the
ground
and
bathed
in
her
blood
they
were
*NL*
still
uncertain
as
to
the
true
nature
of
the
act
.
Lothario
,
terrified
and
*NL*
breathless
,
ran
in
haste
to
pluck
out
the
dagger
;
but
when
he
saw
how
*NL*
slight
the
wound
was
he
was
relieved
of
his
fears
and
once
more
admired
*NL*
the
subtlety
,
coolness
,
and
ready
wit
of
the
fair
Camilla
;
and
the
better
*NL*
to
support
the
part
he
had
to
play
he
began
to
utter
profuse
and
doleful
*NL*
lamentations
over
her
body
as
if
she
were
dead
,
invoking
maledictions
not
*NL*
only
on
himself
but
also
on
him
who
had
been
the
means
of
placing
him
in
*NL*
such
a
position
:
and
knowing
that
his
friend
Anselmo
heard
him
he
spoke
*NL*
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
a
listener
feel
much
more
pity
for
him
than
for
*NL*
Camilla
,
even
though
he
supposed
her
dead
.
Leonela
took
her
up
in
her
*NL*
arms
and
laid
her
on
the
bed
,
entreating
Lothario
to
go
in
quest
of
some
*NL*
one
to
attend
to
her
wound
in
secret
,
and
at
the
same
time
asking
his
*NL*
advice
and
opinion
as
to
what
they
should
say
to
Anselmo
about
his
lady
's
*NL*
wound
if
he
should
chance
to
return
before
it
was
healed
.
He
replied
they
*NL*
might
say
what
they
liked
,
for
he
was
not
in
a
state
to
give
advice
that
*NL*
would
be
of
any
use
;
all
he
could
tell
her
was
to
try
and
stanch
the
*NL*
blood
,
as
he
was
going
where
he
should
never
more
be
seen
;
and
with
every
*NL*
appearance
of
deep
grief
and
sorrow
he
left
the
house
;
but
when
he
found
*NL*
himself
alone
,
and
where
there
was
nobody
to
see
him
,
he
crossed
himself
*NL*
unceasingly
,
lost
in
wonder
at
the
adroitness
of
Camilla
and
the
*NL*
consistent
acting
of
Leonela
.
He
reflected
how
convinced
Anselmo
would
be
*NL*
that
he
had
a
second
Portia
for
a
wife
,
and
he
looked
forward
anxiously
*NL*
to
meeting
him
in
order
to
rejoice
together
over
falsehood
and
truth
the
*NL*
most
craftily
veiled
that
could
be
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonela
,
as
he
told
her
,
stanched
her
lady
's
blood
,
which
was
no
more
*NL*
than
sufficed
to
support
her
deception
;
and
washing
the
wound
with
a
*NL*
little
wine
she
bound
it
up
to
the
best
of
her
skill
,
talking
all
the
*NL*
time
she
was
tending
her
in
a
strain
that
,
even
if
nothing
else
had
been
*NL*
said
before
,
would
have
been
enough
to
assure
Anselmo
that
he
had
in
*NL*
Camilla
a
model
of
purity
.
To
Leonela
's
words
Camilla
added
her
own
,
*NL*
calling
herself
cowardly
and
wanting
in
spirit
,
since
she
had
not
enough
*NL*
at
the
time
she
had
most
need
of
it
to
rid
herself
of
the
life
she
so
*NL*
much
loathed
.
She
asked
her
attendant
's
advice
as
to
whether
or
not
she
*NL*
ought
to
inform
her
beloved
husband
of
all
that
had
happened
,
but
the
*NL*
other
bade
her
say
nothing
about
it
,
as
she
would
lay
upon
him
the
*NL*
obligation
of
taking
vengeance
on
Lothario
,
which
he
could
not
do
but
at
*NL*
great
risk
to
himself
;
and
it
was
the
duty
of
a
true
wife
not
to
give
her
*NL*
husband
provocation
to
quarrel
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
remove
it
as
far
*NL*
as
possible
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Camilla
replied
that
she
believed
she
was
right
and
that
she
would
follow
*NL*
her
advice
,
but
at
any
rate
it
would
be
well
to
consider
how
she
was
to
*NL*
explain
the
wound
to
Anselmo
,
for
he
could
not
help
seeing
it
;
to
which
*NL*
Leonela
answered
that
she
did
not
know
how
to
tell
a
lie
even
in
jest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
then
can
I
know
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Camilla
,
``
for
I
should
not
dare
to
*NL*
forge
or
keep
up
a
falsehood
if
my
life
depended
on
it
.
If
we
can
think
*NL*
of
no
escape
from
this
difficulty
,
it
will
be
better
to
tell
him
the
*NL*
plain
truth
than
that
he
should
find
us
out
in
an
untrue
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
uneasy
,
senora
,
''
said
Leonela
;
``
between
this
and
to-morrow
I
will
*NL*
think
of
what
we
must
say
to
him
,
and
perhaps
the
wound
being
where
it
is
*NL*
it
can
be
hidden
from
his
sight
,
and
Heaven
will
be
pleased
to
aid
us
in
*NL*
a
purpose
so
good
and
honourable
.
Compose
yourself
,
senora
,
and
endeavour
*NL*
to
calm
your
excitement
lest
my
lord
find
you
agitated
;
and
leave
the
*NL*
rest
to
my
care
and
God
's
,
who
always
supports
good
intentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
had
with
the
deepest
attention
listened
to
and
seen
played
out
*NL*
the
tragedy
of
the
death
of
his
honour
,
which
the
performers
acted
with
*NL*
such
wonderfully
effective
truth
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
become
the
*NL*
realities
of
the
parts
they
played
.
He
longed
for
night
and
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
escaping
from
the
house
to
go
and
see
his
good
friend
*NL*
Lothario
,
and
with
him
give
vent
to
his
joy
over
the
precious
pearl
he
*NL*
had
gained
in
having
established
his
wife
's
purity
.
Both
mistress
and
*NL*
maid
took
care
to
give
him
time
and
opportunity
to
get
away
,
and
taking
*NL*
advantage
of
it
he
made
his
escape
,
and
at
once
went
in
quest
of
*NL*
Lothario
,
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
how
he
embraced
him
when
*NL*
he
found
him
,
and
the
things
he
said
to
him
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
,
and
*NL*
the
praises
he
bestowed
upon
Camilla
;
all
which
Lothario
listened
to
*NL*
without
being
able
to
show
any
pleasure
,
for
he
could
not
forget
how
*NL*
deceived
his
friend
was
,
and
how
dishonourably
he
had
wronged
him
;
and
*NL*
though
Anselmo
could
see
that
Lothario
was
not
glad
,
still
he
imagined
it
*NL*
was
only
because
he
had
left
Camilla
wounded
and
had
been
himself
the
*NL*
cause
of
it
;
and
so
among
other
things
he
told
him
not
to
be
distressed
*NL*
about
Camilla
's
accident
,
for
,
as
they
had
agreed
to
hide
it
from
him
,
*NL*
the
wound
was
evidently
trifling
;
and
that
being
so
,
he
had
no
cause
for
*NL*
fear
,
but
should
henceforward
be
of
good
cheer
and
rejoice
with
him
,
*NL*
seeing
that
by
his
means
and
adroitness
he
found
himself
raised
to
the
*NL*
greatest
height
of
happiness
that
he
could
have
ventured
to
hope
for
,
and
*NL*
desired
no
better
pastime
than
making
verses
in
praise
of
Camilla
that
*NL*
would
preserve
her
name
for
all
time
to
come
.
Lothario
commended
his
*NL*
purpose
,
and
promised
on
his
own
part
to
aid
him
in
raising
a
monument
so
*NL*
glorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Anselmo
was
left
the
most
charmingly
hoodwinked
man
there
could
be
*NL*
in
the
world
.
He
himself
,
persuaded
he
was
conducting
the
instrument
of
*NL*
his
glory
,
led
home
by
the
hand
of
him
who
had
been
the
utter
destruction
of
*NL*
his
good
name
;
whom
Camilla
received
with
averted
countenance
,
though
*NL*
with
smiles
in
her
heart
.
The
deception
was
carried
on
for
some
time
,
*NL*
until
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
Fortune
turned
her
wheel
and
the
guilt
*NL*
which
had
been
until
then
so
skilfully
concealed
was
published
abroad
,
*NL*
and
Anselmo
paid
with
his
life
the
penalty
of
his
ill-advised
curiosity
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
THE
HEROIC
AND
PRODIGIOUS
BATTLE
DON
QUIXOTE
HAD
WITH
*NL*
CERTAIN
SKINS
OF
RED
WINE
,
AND
BRINGS
THE
NOVEL
OF
``
THE
ILL-ADVISED
*NL*
CURIOSITY
''
TO
A
CLOSE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
remained
but
little
more
of
the
novel
to
be
read
,
when
Sancho
Panza
*NL*
burst
forth
in
wild
excitement
from
the
garret
where
Don
Quixote
was
*NL*
lying
,
shouting
,
``
Run
,
sirs
!
quick
;
and
help
my
master
,
who
is
in
the
*NL*
thick
of
the
toughest
and
stiffest
battle
I
ever
laid
eyes
on
.
By
the
*NL*
living
God
he
has
given
the
giant
,
the
enemy
of
my
lady
the
Princess
*NL*
Micomicona
,
such
a
slash
that
he
has
sliced
his
head
clean
off
as
if
it
*NL*
were
a
turnip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
talking
about
,
brother
?
''
said
the
curate
,
pausing
as
he
was
*NL*
about
to
read
the
remainder
of
the
novel
.
``
Are
you
in
your
senses
,
*NL*
Sancho
?
How
the
devil
can
it
be
as
you
say
,
when
the
giant
is
two
*NL*
thousand
leagues
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
heard
a
loud
noise
in
the
chamber
,
and
Don
Quixote
shouting
*NL*
out
,
``
Stand
,
thief
,
brigand
,
villain
;
now
I
have
got
thee
,
and
thy
*NL*
scimitar
shall
not
avail
thee
!
''
And
then
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
*NL*
slashing
vigorously
at
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
stop
to
listen
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
go
in
and
part
them
or
help
my
*NL*
master
:
though
there
is
no
need
of
that
now
,
for
no
doubt
the
giant
is
*NL*
dead
by
this
time
and
giving
account
to
God
of
his
past
wicked
life
;
for
*NL*
I
saw
the
blood
flowing
on
the
ground
,
and
the
head
cut
off
and
fallen
on
*NL*
one
side
,
and
it
is
as
big
as
a
large
wine-skin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
die
,
''
said
the
landlord
at
this
,
``
if
Don
Quixote
or
Don
Devil
has
*NL*
not
been
slashing
some
of
the
skins
of
red
wine
that
stand
full
at
his
*NL*
bed
's
head
,
and
the
spilt
wine
must
be
what
this
good
fellow
takes
for
*NL*
blood
;
''
and
so
saying
he
went
into
the
room
and
the
rest
after
him
,
and
*NL*
there
they
found
Don
Quixote
in
the
strangest
costume
in
the
world
.
He
*NL*
was
in
his
shirt
,
which
was
not
long
enough
in
front
to
cover
his
thighs
*NL*
completely
and
was
six
fingers
shorter
behind
;
his
legs
were
very
long
*NL*
and
lean
,
covered
with
hair
,
and
anything
but
clean
;
on
his
head
he
had
a
*NL*
little
greasy
red
cap
that
belonged
to
the
host
,
round
his
left
arm
he
*NL*
had
rolled
the
blanket
of
the
bed
,
to
which
Sancho
,
for
reasons
best
*NL*
known
to
himself
,
owed
a
grudge
,
and
in
his
right
hand
he
held
his
*NL*
unsheathed
sword
,
with
which
he
was
slashing
about
on
all
sides
,
uttering
*NL*
exclamations
as
if
he
were
actually
fighting
some
giant
:
and
the
best
of
*NL*
it
was
his
eyes
were
not
open
,
for
he
was
fast
asleep
,
and
dreaming
that
*NL*
he
was
doing
battle
with
the
giant
.
For
his
imagination
was
so
wrought
*NL*
upon
by
the
adventure
he
was
going
to
accomplish
,
that
it
made
him
dream
*NL*
he
had
already
reached
the
kingdom
of
Micomicon
,
and
was
engaged
in
*NL*
combat
with
his
enemy
;
and
believing
he
was
laying
on
the
giant
,
he
had
*NL*
given
so
many
sword
cuts
to
the
skins
that
the
whole
room
was
full
of
*NL*
wine
.
On
seeing
this
the
landlord
was
so
enraged
that
he
fell
on
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
and
with
his
clenched
fist
began
to
pummel
him
in
such
a
way
,
*NL*
that
if
Cardenio
and
the
curate
had
not
dragged
him
off
,
he
would
have
*NL*
brought
the
war
of
the
giant
to
an
end
.
But
in
spite
of
all
the
poor
*NL*
gentleman
never
woke
until
the
barber
brought
a
great
pot
of
cold
water
*NL*
from
the
well
and
flung
it
with
one
dash
all
over
his
body
,
on
which
Don
*NL*
Quixote
woke
up
,
but
not
so
completely
as
to
understand
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
.
Dorothea
,
seeing
how
short
and
slight
his
attire
was
,
would
not
*NL*
go
in
to
witness
the
battle
between
her
champion
and
her
opponent
.
As
for
*NL*
Sancho
,
he
went
searching
all
over
the
floor
for
the
head
of
the
giant
,
*NL*
and
not
finding
it
he
said
,
``
I
see
now
that
it
's
all
enchantment
in
this
*NL*
house
;
for
the
last
time
,
on
this
very
spot
where
I
am
now
,
I
got
ever
so
*NL*
many
thumps
without
knowing
who
gave
them
to
me
,
or
being
able
to
see
*NL*
anybody
;
and
now
this
head
is
not
to
be
seen
anywhere
about
,
though
I
saw
*NL*
it
cut
off
with
my
own
eyes
and
the
blood
running
from
the
body
as
if
*NL*
from
a
fountain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
blood
and
fountains
are
you
talking
about
,
enemy
of
God
and
his
*NL*
saints
?
''
said
the
landlord
.
``
Do
n't
you
see
,
you
thief
,
that
the
blood
and
*NL*
the
fountain
are
only
these
skins
here
that
have
been
stabbed
and
the
red
*NL*
wine
swimming
all
over
the
room
?
--
and
I
wish
I
saw
the
soul
of
him
that
*NL*
stabbed
them
swimming
in
hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
that
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
all
I
know
is
it
will
be
my
*NL*
bad
luck
that
through
not
finding
this
head
my
county
will
melt
away
like
*NL*
salt
in
water
;
''
--
for
Sancho
awake
was
worse
than
his
master
asleep
,
so
*NL*
much
had
his
master
's
promises
addled
his
wits
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
was
beside
himself
at
the
coolness
of
the
squire
and
the
*NL*
mischievous
doings
of
the
master
,
and
swore
it
should
not
be
like
the
*NL*
last
time
when
they
went
without
paying
;
and
that
their
privileges
of
*NL*
chivalry
should
not
hold
good
this
time
to
let
one
or
other
of
them
off
*NL*
without
paying
,
even
to
the
cost
of
the
plugs
that
would
have
to
be
put
*NL*
to
the
damaged
wine-skins
.
The
curate
was
holding
Don
Quixote
's
hands
,
*NL*
who
,
fancying
he
had
now
ended
the
adventure
and
was
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
the
Princess
Micomicona
,
knelt
before
the
curate
and
said
,
``
Exalted
and
*NL*
beauteous
lady
,
your
highness
may
live
from
this
day
forth
fearless
of
*NL*
any
harm
this
base
being
could
do
you
;
and
I
too
from
this
day
forth
am
*NL*
released
from
the
promise
I
gave
you
,
since
by
the
help
of
God
on
high
*NL*
and
by
the
favour
of
her
by
whom
I
live
and
breathe
,
I
have
fulfilled
it
*NL*
so
successfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
I
say
so
?
''
said
Sancho
on
hearing
this
.
``
You
see
I
was
n't
drunk
;
*NL*
there
you
see
my
master
has
already
salted
the
giant
;
there
's
no
doubt
*NL*
about
the
bulls
;
my
county
is
all
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Who
could
have
helped
laughing
at
the
absurdities
of
the
pair
,
master
and
*NL*
man
?
And
laugh
they
did
,
all
except
the
landlord
,
who
cursed
himself
;
but
*NL*
at
length
the
barber
,
Cardenio
,
and
the
curate
contrived
with
no
small
*NL*
trouble
to
get
Don
Quixote
on
the
bed
,
and
he
fell
asleep
with
every
*NL*
appearance
of
excessive
weariness
.
They
left
him
to
sleep
,
and
came
out
*NL*
to
the
gate
of
the
inn
to
console
Sancho
Panza
on
not
having
found
the
*NL*
head
of
the
giant
;
but
much
more
work
had
they
to
appease
the
landlord
,
*NL*
who
was
furious
at
the
sudden
death
of
his
wine-skins
;
and
said
the
*NL*
landlady
half
scolding
,
half
crying
,
``
At
an
evil
moment
and
in
an
unlucky
*NL*
hour
he
came
into
my
house
,
this
knight-errant
--
would
that
I
had
never
*NL*
set
eyes
on
him
,
for
dear
he
has
cost
me
;
the
last
time
he
went
off
with
*NL*
the
overnight
score
against
him
for
supper
,
bed
,
straw
,
and
barley
,
for
*NL*
himself
and
his
squire
and
a
hack
and
an
ass
,
saying
he
was
a
knight
*NL*
adventurer
--
God
send
unlucky
adventures
to
him
and
all
the
adventurers
in
*NL*
the
world
--
and
therefore
not
bound
to
pay
anything
,
for
it
was
so
settled
*NL*
by
the
knight-errantry
tariff
:
and
then
,
all
because
of
him
,
came
the
*NL*
other
gentleman
and
carried
off
my
tail
,
and
gives
it
back
more
than
two
*NL*
cuartillos
the
worse
,
all
stripped
of
its
hair
,
so
that
it
is
no
use
for
*NL*
my
husband
's
purpose
;
and
then
,
for
a
finishing
touch
to
all
,
to
burst
my
*NL*
wine-skins
and
spill
my
wine
!
I
wish
I
saw
his
own
blood
spilt
!
But
let
*NL*
him
not
deceive
himself
,
for
,
by
the
bones
of
my
father
and
the
shade
of
*NL*
my
mother
,
they
shall
pay
me
down
every
quarts
;
or
my
name
is
not
what
it
*NL*
is
,
and
I
am
not
my
father
's
daughter
.
''
All
this
and
more
to
the
same
*NL*
effect
the
landlady
delivered
with
great
irritation
,
and
her
good
maid
*NL*
Maritornes
backed
her
up
,
while
the
daughter
held
her
peace
and
smiled
*NL*
from
time
to
time
.
The
curate
smoothed
matters
by
promising
to
make
good
*NL*
all
losses
to
the
best
of
his
power
,
not
only
as
regarded
the
wine-skins
*NL*
but
also
the
wine
,
and
above
all
the
depreciation
of
the
tail
which
they
*NL*
set
such
store
by
.
Dorothea
comforted
Sancho
,
telling
him
that
she
*NL*
pledged
herself
,
as
soon
as
it
should
appear
certain
that
his
master
had
*NL*
decapitated
the
giant
,
and
she
found
herself
peacefully
established
in
*NL*
her
kingdom
,
to
bestow
upon
him
the
best
county
there
was
in
it
.
With
*NL*
this
Sancho
consoled
himself
,
and
assured
the
princess
she
might
rely
*NL*
upon
it
that
he
had
seen
the
head
of
the
giant
,
and
more
by
token
it
had
*NL*
a
beard
that
reached
to
the
girdle
,
and
that
if
it
was
not
to
be
seen
now
*NL*
it
was
because
everything
that
happened
in
that
house
went
by
*NL*
enchantment
,
as
he
himself
had
proved
the
last
time
he
had
lodged
there
.
*NL*
Dorothea
said
she
fully
believed
it
,
and
that
he
need
not
be
uneasy
,
for
*NL*
all
would
go
well
and
turn
out
as
he
wished
.
All
therefore
being
*NL*
appeased
,
the
curate
was
anxious
to
go
on
with
the
novel
,
as
he
saw
there
*NL*
was
but
little
more
left
to
read
.
Dorothea
and
the
others
begged
him
to
*NL*
finish
it
,
and
he
,
as
he
was
willing
to
please
them
,
and
enjoyed
reading
*NL*
it
himself
,
continued
the
tale
in
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
was
,
that
from
the
confidence
Anselmo
felt
in
Camilla
's
*NL*
virtue
,
he
lived
happy
and
free
from
anxiety
,
and
Camilla
purposely
*NL*
looked
coldly
on
Lothario
,
that
Anselmo
might
suppose
her
feelings
*NL*
towards
him
to
be
the
opposite
of
what
they
were
;
and
the
better
to
*NL*
support
the
position
,
Lothario
begged
to
be
excused
from
coming
to
the
*NL*
house
,
as
the
displeasure
with
which
Camilla
regarded
his
presence
was
*NL*
plain
to
be
seen
.
But
the
befooled
Anselmo
said
he
would
on
no
account
*NL*
allow
such
a
thing
,
and
so
in
a
thousand
ways
he
became
the
author
of
his
*NL*
own
dishonour
,
while
he
believed
he
was
insuring
his
happiness
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
the
satisfaction
with
which
Leonela
saw
herself
empowered
to
carry
on
her
*NL*
amour
reached
such
a
height
that
,
regardless
of
everything
else
,
she
*NL*
followed
her
inclinations
unrestrainedly
,
feeling
confident
that
her
*NL*
mistress
would
screen
her
,
and
even
show
her
how
to
manage
it
safely
.
At
*NL*
last
one
night
Anselmo
heard
footsteps
in
Leonela
's
room
,
and
on
trying
*NL*
to
enter
to
see
who
it
was
,
he
found
that
the
door
was
held
against
him
,
*NL*
which
made
him
all
the
more
determined
to
open
it
;
and
exerting
his
*NL*
strength
he
forced
it
open
,
and
entered
the
room
in
time
to
see
a
man
*NL*
leaping
through
the
window
into
the
street
.
He
ran
quickly
to
seize
him
*NL*
or
discover
who
he
was
,
but
he
was
unable
to
effect
either
purpose
,
for
*NL*
Leonela
flung
her
arms
round
him
crying
,
``
Be
calm
,
senor
;
do
not
give
way
*NL*
to
passion
or
follow
him
who
has
escaped
from
this
;
he
belongs
to
me
,
and
*NL*
in
fact
he
is
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
would
not
believe
it
,
but
blind
with
rage
drew
a
dagger
and
*NL*
threatened
to
stab
Leonela
,
bidding
her
tell
the
truth
or
he
would
kill
*NL*
her
.
She
,
in
her
fear
,
not
knowing
what
she
was
saying
,
exclaimed
,
``
Do
*NL*
not
kill
me
,
senor
,
for
I
can
tell
you
things
more
important
than
any
you
*NL*
can
imagine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
then
at
once
or
thou
diest
,
''
said
Anselmo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
impossible
for
me
now
,
''
said
Leonela
,
``
I
am
so
agitated
:
*NL*
leave
me
till
to-morrow
,
and
then
you
shall
hear
from
me
what
will
fill
*NL*
you
with
astonishment
;
but
rest
assured
that
he
who
leaped
through
the
*NL*
window
is
a
young
man
of
this
city
,
who
has
given
me
his
promise
to
*NL*
become
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anselmo
was
appeased
with
this
,
and
was
content
to
wait
the
time
she
*NL*
asked
of
him
,
for
he
never
expected
to
hear
anything
against
Camilla
,
so
*NL*
satisfied
and
sure
of
her
virtue
was
he
;
and
so
he
quitted
the
room
,
and
*NL*
left
Leonela
locked
in
,
telling
her
she
should
not
come
out
until
she
had
*NL*
told
him
all
she
had
to
make
known
to
him
.
He
went
at
once
to
see
*NL*
Camilla
,
and
tell
her
,
as
he
did
,
all
that
had
passed
between
him
and
her
*NL*
handmaid
,
and
the
promise
she
had
given
him
to
inform
him
matters
of
*NL*
serious
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
need
of
saying
whether
Camilla
was
agitated
or
not
,
for
so
*NL*
great
was
her
fear
and
dismay
,
that
,
making
sure
,
as
she
had
good
reason
*NL*
to
do
,
that
Leonela
would
tell
Anselmo
all
she
knew
of
her
faithlessness
,
*NL*
she
had
not
the
courage
to
wait
and
see
if
her
suspicions
were
confirmed
;
*NL*
and
that
same
night
,
as
soon
as
she
thought
that
Anselmo
was
asleep
,
she
*NL*
packed
up
the
most
valuable
jewels
she
had
and
some
money
,
and
without
*NL*
being
observed
by
anybody
escaped
from
the
house
and
betook
herself
to
*NL*
Lothario
's
,
to
whom
she
related
what
had
occurred
,
imploring
him
to
*NL*
convey
her
to
some
place
of
safety
or
fly
with
her
where
they
might
be
*NL*
safe
from
Anselmo
.
The
state
of
perplexity
to
which
Camilla
reduced
*NL*
Lothario
was
such
that
he
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
in
reply
,
still
less
*NL*
to
decide
upon
what
he
should
do
.
At
length
he
resolved
to
conduct
her
to
*NL*
a
convent
of
which
a
sister
of
his
was
prioress
;
Camilla
agreed
to
this
,
*NL*
and
with
the
speed
which
the
circumstances
demanded
,
Lothario
took
her
to
*NL*
the
convent
and
left
her
there
,
and
then
himself
quitted
the
city
without
*NL*
letting
anyone
know
of
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
daylight
came
Anselmo
,
without
missing
Camilla
from
his
side
,
*NL*
rose
eager
to
learn
what
Leonela
had
to
tell
him
,
and
hastened
to
the
*NL*
room
where
he
had
locked
her
in
.
He
opened
the
door
,
entered
,
but
found
*NL*
no
Leonela
;
all
he
found
was
some
sheets
knotted
to
the
window
,
a
plain
*NL*
proof
that
she
had
let
herself
down
from
it
and
escaped
.
He
returned
,
*NL*
uneasy
,
to
tell
Camilla
,
but
not
finding
her
in
bed
or
anywhere
in
the
*NL*
house
he
was
lost
in
amazement
.
He
asked
the
servants
of
the
house
about
*NL*
her
,
but
none
of
them
could
give
him
any
explanation
.
As
he
was
going
in
*NL*
search
of
Camilla
it
happened
by
chance
that
he
observed
her
boxes
were
*NL*
lying
open
,
and
that
the
greater
part
of
her
jewels
were
gone
;
and
now
he
*NL*
became
fully
aware
of
his
disgrace
,
and
that
Leonela
was
not
the
cause
of
*NL*
his
misfortune
;
and
,
just
as
he
was
,
without
delaying
to
dress
himself
*NL*
completely
,
he
repaired
,
sad
at
heart
and
dejected
,
to
his
friend
*NL*
Lothario
to
make
known
his
sorrow
to
him
;
but
when
he
failed
to
find
him
*NL*
and
the
servants
reported
that
he
had
been
absent
from
his
house
all
*NL*
night
and
had
taken
with
him
all
the
money
he
had
,
he
felt
as
though
he
*NL*
were
losing
his
senses
;
and
to
make
all
complete
on
returning
to
his
own
*NL*
house
he
found
it
deserted
and
empty
,
not
one
of
all
his
servants
,
male
*NL*
or
female
,
remaining
in
it
.
He
knew
not
what
to
think
,
or
say
,
or
do
,
and
*NL*
his
reason
seemed
to
be
deserting
him
little
by
little
.
He
reviewed
his
*NL*
position
,
and
saw
himself
in
a
moment
left
without
wife
,
friend
,
or
*NL*
servants
,
abandoned
,
he
felt
,
by
the
heaven
above
him
,
and
more
than
all
*NL*
robbed
of
his
honour
,
for
in
Camilla
's
disappearance
he
saw
his
own
ruin
.
*NL*
After
long
reflection
he
resolved
at
last
to
go
to
his
friend
's
village
,
*NL*
where
he
had
been
staying
when
he
afforded
opportunities
for
the
*NL*
contrivance
of
this
complication
of
misfortune
.
He
locked
the
doors
of
*NL*
his
house
,
mounted
his
horse
,
and
with
a
broken
spirit
set
out
on
his
*NL*
journey
;
but
he
had
hardly
gone
half-way
when
,
harassed
by
his
*NL*
reflections
,
he
had
to
dismount
and
tie
his
horse
to
a
tree
,
at
the
foot
*NL*
of
which
he
threw
himself
,
giving
vent
to
piteous
heartrending
sighs
;
and
*NL*
there
he
remained
till
nearly
nightfall
,
when
he
observed
a
man
*NL*
approaching
on
horseback
from
the
city
,
of
whom
,
after
saluting
him
,
he
*NL*
asked
what
was
the
news
in
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
citizen
replied
,
``
The
strangest
that
have
been
heard
for
many
a
day
;
*NL*
for
it
is
reported
abroad
that
Lothario
,
the
great
friend
of
the
wealthy
*NL*
Anselmo
,
who
lived
at
San
Giovanni
,
carried
off
last
night
Camilla
,
the
*NL*
wife
of
Anselmo
,
who
also
has
disappeared
.
All
this
has
been
told
by
a
*NL*
maid-servant
of
Camilla
's
,
whom
the
governor
found
last
night
lowering
*NL*
herself
by
a
sheet
from
the
windows
of
Anselmo
's
house
.
I
know
not
*NL*
indeed
,
precisely
,
how
the
affair
came
to
pass
;
all
I
know
is
that
the
*NL*
whole
city
is
wondering
at
the
occurrence
,
for
no
one
could
have
expected
*NL*
a
thing
of
the
kind
,
seeing
the
great
and
intimate
friendship
that
*NL*
existed
between
them
,
so
great
,
they
say
,
that
they
were
called
`
The
Two
*NL*
Friends
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
known
at
all
,
''
said
Anselmo
,
``
what
road
Lothario
and
Camilla
*NL*
took
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least
,
''
said
the
citizen
,
``
though
the
governor
has
been
very
*NL*
active
in
searching
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
speed
you
,
senor
,
''
said
Anselmo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
be
with
you
,
''
said
the
citizen
and
went
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
disastrous
intelligence
almost
robbed
Anselmo
not
only
of
his
senses
*NL*
but
of
his
life
.
He
got
up
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
reached
the
house
*NL*
of
his
friend
,
who
as
yet
knew
nothing
of
his
misfortune
,
but
seeing
him
*NL*
come
pale
,
worn
,
and
haggard
,
perceived
that
he
was
suffering
some
heavy
*NL*
affliction
.
Anselmo
at
once
begged
to
be
allowed
to
retire
to
rest
,
and
*NL*
to
be
given
writing
materials
.
His
wish
was
complied
with
and
he
was
left
*NL*
lying
down
and
alone
,
for
he
desired
this
,
and
even
that
the
door
should
*NL*
be
locked
.
Finding
himself
alone
he
so
took
to
heart
the
thought
of
his
*NL*
misfortune
that
by
the
signs
of
death
he
felt
within
him
he
knew
well
his
*NL*
life
was
drawing
to
a
close
,
and
therefore
he
resolved
to
leave
behind
*NL*
him
a
declaration
of
the
cause
of
his
strange
end
.
He
began
to
write
,
but
*NL*
before
he
had
put
down
all
he
meant
to
say
,
his
breath
failed
him
and
he
*NL*
yielded
up
his
life
,
a
victim
to
the
suffering
which
his
ill-advised
*NL*
curiosity
had
entailed
upon
him
.
The
master
of
the
house
observing
that
*NL*
it
was
now
late
and
that
Anselmo
did
not
call
,
determined
to
go
in
and
*NL*
ascertain
if
his
indisposition
was
increasing
,
and
found
him
lying
on
his
*NL*
face
,
his
body
partly
in
the
bed
,
partly
on
the
writing-table
,
on
which
*NL*
he
lay
with
the
written
paper
open
and
the
pen
still
in
his
hand
.
Having
*NL*
first
called
to
him
without
receiving
any
answer
,
his
host
approached
*NL*
him
,
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
found
that
it
was
cold
,
and
saw
that
he
*NL*
was
dead
.
Greatly
surprised
and
distressed
he
summoned
the
household
to
*NL*
witness
the
sad
fate
which
had
befallen
Anselmo
;
and
then
he
read
the
*NL*
paper
,
the
handwriting
of
which
he
recognised
as
his
,
and
which
contained
*NL*
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
foolish
and
ill-advised
desire
has
robbed
me
of
life
.
If
the
news
of
*NL*
my
death
should
reach
the
ears
of
Camilla
,
let
her
know
that
I
forgive
*NL*
her
,
for
she
was
not
bound
to
perform
miracles
,
nor
ought
I
to
have
*NL*
required
her
to
perform
them
;
and
since
I
have
been
the
author
of
my
own
*NL*
dishonour
,
there
is
no
reason
why
-
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
Anselmo
had
written
,
and
thus
it
was
plain
that
at
this
point
,
*NL*
before
he
could
finish
what
he
had
to
say
,
his
life
came
to
an
end
.
The
*NL*
next
day
his
friend
sent
intelligence
of
his
death
to
his
relatives
,
who
*NL*
had
already
ascertained
his
misfortune
,
as
well
as
the
convent
where
*NL*
Camilla
lay
almost
on
the
point
of
accompanying
her
husband
on
that
*NL*
inevitable
journey
,
not
on
account
of
the
tidings
of
his
death
,
but
*NL*
because
of
those
she
received
of
her
lover
's
departure
.
Although
she
saw
*NL*
herself
a
widow
,
it
is
said
she
refused
either
to
quit
the
convent
or
*NL*
take
the
veil
,
until
,
not
long
afterwards
,
intelligence
reached
her
that
*NL*
Lothario
had
been
killed
in
a
battle
in
which
M.
de
Lautrec
had
been
*NL*
recently
engaged
with
the
Great
Captain
Gonzalo
Fernandez
de
Cordova
in
*NL*
the
kingdom
of
Naples
,
whither
her
too
late
repentant
lover
had
repaired
.
*NL*
On
learning
this
Camilla
took
the
veil
,
and
shortly
afterwards
died
,
worn
*NL*
out
by
grief
and
melancholy
.
This
was
the
end
of
all
three
,
an
end
that
*NL*
came
of
a
thoughtless
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
this
novel
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
but
I
can
not
persuade
myself
of
*NL*
its
truth
;
and
if
it
has
been
invented
,
the
author
's
invention
is
faulty
,
*NL*
for
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
any
husband
so
foolish
as
to
try
such
a
*NL*
costly
experiment
as
Anselmo
's
.
If
it
had
been
represented
as
occurring
*NL*
between
a
gallant
and
his
mistress
it
might
pass
;
but
between
husband
and
*NL*
wife
there
is
something
of
an
impossibility
about
it
.
As
to
the
way
in
*NL*
which
the
story
is
told
,
however
,
I
have
no
fault
to
find
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
MORE
CURIOUS
INCIDENTS
THAT
OCCURRED
AT
THE
INN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
that
instant
the
landlord
,
who
was
standing
at
the
gate
of
the
*NL*
inn
,
exclaimed
,
``
Here
comes
a
fine
troop
of
guests
;
if
they
stop
here
we
*NL*
may
say
gaudeamus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
?
''
said
Cardenio
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
men
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
``
riding
a
la
jineta
,
with
lances
and
*NL*
bucklers
,
and
all
with
black
veils
,
and
with
them
there
is
a
woman
in
*NL*
white
on
a
side-saddle
,
whose
face
is
also
veiled
,
and
two
attendants
on
*NL*
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
very
near
?
''
said
the
curate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
near
,
''
answered
the
landlord
,
``
that
here
they
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
Dorothea
covered
her
face
,
and
Cardenio
retreated
into
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
room
,
and
they
hardly
had
time
to
do
so
before
the
whole
party
*NL*
the
host
had
described
entered
the
inn
,
and
the
four
that
were
on
*NL*
horseback
,
who
were
of
highbred
appearance
and
bearing
,
dismounted
,
and
*NL*
came
forward
to
take
down
the
woman
who
rode
on
the
side-saddle
,
and
one
*NL*
of
them
taking
her
in
his
arms
placed
her
in
a
chair
that
stood
at
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
room
where
Cardenio
had
hidden
himself
.
All
this
time
*NL*
neither
she
nor
they
had
removed
their
veils
or
spoken
a
word
,
only
on
*NL*
sitting
down
on
the
chair
the
woman
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
let
her
arms
*NL*
fall
like
one
that
was
ill
and
weak
.
The
attendants
on
foot
then
led
the
*NL*
horses
away
to
the
stable
.
Observing
this
the
curate
,
curious
to
know
who
*NL*
these
people
in
such
a
dress
and
preserving
such
silence
were
,
went
to
*NL*
where
the
servants
were
standing
and
put
the
question
to
one
of
them
,
who
*NL*
answered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
,
sir
,
I
can
not
tell
you
who
they
are
,
I
only
know
they
seem
to
be
*NL*
people
of
distinction
,
particularly
he
who
advanced
to
take
the
lady
you
*NL*
saw
in
his
arms
;
and
I
say
so
because
all
the
rest
show
him
respect
,
and
*NL*
nothing
is
done
except
what
he
directs
and
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
lady
,
who
is
she
?
''
asked
the
curate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
not
tell
you
either
,
''
said
the
servant
,
``
for
I
have
not
seen
*NL*
her
face
all
the
way
:
I
have
indeed
heard
her
sigh
many
times
and
utter
*NL*
such
groans
that
she
seems
to
be
giving
up
the
ghost
every
time
;
but
it
*NL*
is
no
wonder
if
we
do
not
know
more
than
we
have
told
you
,
as
my
comrade
*NL*
and
I
have
only
been
in
their
company
two
days
,
for
having
met
us
on
the
*NL*
road
they
begged
and
persuaded
us
to
accompany
them
to
Andalusia
,
*NL*
promising
to
pay
us
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
heard
any
of
them
called
by
his
name
?
''
asked
the
curate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
replied
the
servant
;
``
they
all
preserve
a
marvellous
*NL*
silence
on
the
road
,
for
not
a
sound
is
to
be
heard
among
them
except
the
*NL*
poor
lady
's
sighs
and
sobs
,
which
make
us
pity
her
;
and
we
feel
sure
that
*NL*
wherever
it
is
she
is
going
,
it
is
against
her
will
,
and
as
far
as
one
*NL*
can
judge
from
her
dress
she
is
a
nun
or
,
what
is
more
likely
,
about
to
*NL*
become
one
;
and
perhaps
it
is
because
taking
the
vows
is
not
of
her
own
*NL*
free
will
,
that
she
is
so
unhappy
as
she
seems
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
well
be
,
''
said
the
curate
,
and
leaving
them
he
returned
to
*NL*
where
Dorothea
was
,
who
,
hearing
the
veiled
lady
sigh
,
moved
by
natural
*NL*
compassion
drew
near
to
her
and
said
,
``
What
are
you
suffering
from
,
*NL*
senora
?
If
it
be
anything
that
women
are
accustomed
and
know
how
to
*NL*
relieve
,
I
offer
you
my
services
with
all
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
unhappy
lady
made
no
reply
;
and
though
Dorothea
repeated
her
*NL*
offers
more
earnestly
she
still
kept
silence
,
until
the
gentleman
with
*NL*
the
veil
,
who
,
the
servant
said
,
was
obeyed
by
the
rest
,
approached
and
*NL*
said
to
Dorothea
,
``
Do
not
give
yourself
the
trouble
,
senora
,
of
making
*NL*
any
offers
to
that
woman
,
for
it
is
her
way
to
give
no
thanks
for
*NL*
anything
that
is
done
for
her
;
and
do
not
try
to
make
her
answer
unless
*NL*
you
want
to
hear
some
lie
from
her
lips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
told
a
lie
,
''
was
the
immediate
reply
of
her
who
had
been
*NL*
silent
until
now
;
``
on
the
contrary
,
it
is
because
I
am
so
truthful
and
so
*NL*
ignorant
of
lying
devices
that
I
am
now
in
this
miserable
condition
;
and
*NL*
this
I
call
you
yourself
to
witness
,
for
it
is
my
unstained
truth
that
*NL*
has
made
you
false
and
a
liar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cardenio
heard
these
words
clearly
and
distinctly
,
being
quite
close
to
*NL*
the
speaker
,
for
there
was
only
the
door
of
Don
Quixote
's
room
between
*NL*
them
,
and
the
instant
he
did
so
,
uttering
a
loud
exclamation
he
cried
,
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
what
is
this
I
hear
?
What
voice
is
this
that
has
reached
my
*NL*
ears
?
''
Startled
at
the
voice
the
lady
turned
her
head
;
and
not
seeing
the
*NL*
speaker
she
stood
up
and
attempted
to
enter
the
room
;
observing
which
the
*NL*
gentleman
held
her
back
,
preventing
her
from
moving
a
step
.
In
her
*NL*
agitation
and
sudden
movement
the
silk
with
which
she
had
covered
her
*NL*
face
fell
off
and
disclosed
a
countenance
of
incomparable
and
marvellous
*NL*
beauty
,
but
pale
and
terrified
;
for
she
kept
turning
her
eyes
,
everywhere
*NL*
she
could
direct
her
gaze
,
with
an
eagerness
that
made
her
look
as
if
she
*NL*
had
lost
her
senses
,
and
so
marked
that
it
excited
the
pity
of
Dorothea
*NL*
and
all
who
beheld
her
,
though
they
knew
not
what
caused
it
.
The
*NL*
gentleman
grasped
her
firmly
by
the
shoulders
,
and
being
so
fully
*NL*
occupied
with
holding
her
back
,
he
was
unable
to
put
a
hand
to
his
veil
*NL*
which
was
falling
off
,
as
it
did
at
length
entirely
,
and
Dorothea
,
who
*NL*
was
holding
the
lady
in
her
arms
,
raising
her
eyes
saw
that
he
who
*NL*
likewise
held
her
was
her
husband
,
Don
Fernando
.
The
instant
she
*NL*
recognised
him
,
with
a
prolonged
plaintive
cry
drawn
from
the
depths
of
*NL*
her
heart
,
she
fell
backwards
fainting
,
and
but
for
the
barber
being
*NL*
close
by
to
catch
her
in
his
arms
,
she
would
have
fallen
completely
to
*NL*
the
ground
.
The
curate
at
once
hastened
to
uncover
her
face
and
throw
*NL*
water
on
it
,
and
as
he
did
so
Don
Fernando
,
for
he
it
was
who
held
the
*NL*
other
in
his
arms
,
recognised
her
and
stood
as
if
death-stricken
by
the
*NL*
sight
;
not
,
however
,
relaxing
his
grasp
of
Luscinda
,
for
it
was
she
that
*NL*
was
struggling
to
release
herself
from
his
hold
,
having
recognised
*NL*
Cardenio
by
his
voice
,
as
he
had
recognised
her
.
Cardenio
also
heard
*NL*
Dorothea
's
cry
as
she
fell
fainting
,
and
imagining
that
it
came
from
his
*NL*
Luscinda
burst
forth
in
terror
from
the
room
,
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
*NL*
was
Don
Fernando
with
Luscinda
in
his
arms
.
Don
Fernando
,
too
,
knew
*NL*
Cardenio
at
once
;
and
all
three
,
Luscinda
,
Cardenio
,
and
Dorothea
,
stood
*NL*
in
silent
amazement
scarcely
knowing
what
had
happened
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
gazed
at
one
another
without
speaking
,
Dorothea
at
Don
Fernando
,
Don
*NL*
Fernando
at
Cardenio
,
Cardenio
at
Luscinda
,
and
Luscinda
at
Cardenio
.
The
*NL*
first
to
break
silence
was
Luscinda
,
who
thus
addressed
Don
Fernando
:
*NL*
``
Leave
me
,
Senor
Don
Fernando
,
for
the
sake
of
what
you
owe
to
yourself
;
*NL*
if
no
other
reason
will
induce
you
,
leave
me
to
cling
to
the
wall
of
*NL*
which
I
am
the
ivy
,
to
the
support
from
which
neither
your
importunities
,
*NL*
nor
your
threats
,
nor
your
promises
,
nor
your
gifts
have
been
able
to
*NL*
detach
me
.
See
how
Heaven
,
by
ways
strange
and
hidden
from
our
sight
,
has
*NL*
brought
me
face
to
face
with
my
true
husband
;
and
well
you
know
by
*NL*
dear-bought
experience
that
death
alone
will
be
able
to
efface
him
from
*NL*
my
memory
.
May
this
plain
declaration
,
then
,
lead
you
,
as
you
can
do
*NL*
nothing
else
,
to
turn
your
love
into
rage
,
your
affection
into
*NL*
resentment
,
and
so
to
take
my
life
;
for
if
I
yield
it
up
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
my
beloved
husband
I
count
it
well
bestowed
;
it
may
be
by
my
death
he
*NL*
will
be
convinced
that
I
kept
my
faith
to
him
to
the
last
moment
of
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Dorothea
had
come
to
herself
,
and
had
heard
Luscinda
's
words
,
*NL*
by
means
of
which
she
divined
who
she
was
;
but
seeing
that
Don
Fernando
*NL*
did
not
yet
release
her
or
reply
to
her
,
summoning
up
her
resolution
as
*NL*
well
as
she
could
she
rose
and
knelt
at
his
feet
,
and
with
a
flood
of
*NL*
bright
and
touching
tears
addressed
him
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
,
my
lord
,
the
beams
of
that
sun
that
thou
holdest
eclipsed
in
thine
*NL*
arms
did
not
dazzle
and
rob
thine
eyes
of
sight
thou
wouldst
have
seen
by
*NL*
this
time
that
she
who
kneels
at
thy
feet
is
,
so
long
as
thou
wilt
have
*NL*
it
so
,
the
unhappy
and
unfortunate
Dorothea
.
I
am
that
lowly
peasant
girl
*NL*
whom
thou
in
thy
goodness
or
for
thy
pleasure
wouldst
raise
high
enough
*NL*
to
call
herself
thine
;
I
am
she
who
in
the
seclusion
of
innocence
led
a
*NL*
contented
life
until
at
the
voice
of
thy
importunity
,
and
thy
true
and
*NL*
tender
passion
,
as
it
seemed
,
she
opened
the
gates
of
her
modesty
and
*NL*
surrendered
to
thee
the
keys
of
her
liberty
;
a
gift
received
by
thee
but
*NL*
thanklessly
,
as
is
clearly
shown
by
my
forced
retreat
to
the
place
where
*NL*
thou
dost
find
me
,
and
by
thy
appearance
under
the
circumstances
in
which
*NL*
I
see
thee
.
Nevertheless
,
I
would
not
have
thee
suppose
that
I
have
come
*NL*
here
driven
by
my
shame
;
it
is
only
grief
and
sorrow
at
seeing
myself
*NL*
forgotten
by
thee
that
have
led
me
.
It
was
thy
will
to
make
me
thine
,
and
*NL*
thou
didst
so
follow
thy
will
,
that
now
,
even
though
thou
repentest
,
thou
*NL*
canst
not
help
being
mine
.
Bethink
thee
,
my
lord
,
the
unsurpassable
*NL*
affection
I
bear
thee
may
compensate
for
the
beauty
and
noble
birth
for
*NL*
which
thou
wouldst
desert
me
.
Thou
canst
not
be
the
fair
Luscinda
's
*NL*
because
thou
art
mine
,
nor
can
she
be
thine
because
she
is
Cardenio
's
;
*NL*
and
it
will
be
easier
,
remember
,
to
bend
thy
will
to
love
one
who
adores
*NL*
thee
,
than
to
lead
one
to
love
thee
who
abhors
thee
now
.
Thou
didst
*NL*
address
thyself
to
my
simplicity
,
thou
didst
lay
siege
to
my
virtue
,
thou
*NL*
wert
not
ignorant
of
my
station
,
well
dost
thou
know
how
I
yielded
wholly
*NL*
to
thy
will
;
there
is
no
ground
or
reason
for
thee
to
plead
deception
,
*NL*
and
if
it
be
so
,
as
it
is
,
and
if
thou
art
a
Christian
as
thou
art
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
why
dost
thou
by
such
subterfuges
put
off
making
me
as
happy
*NL*
at
last
as
thou
didst
at
first
?
And
if
thou
wilt
not
have
me
for
what
I
*NL*
am
,
thy
true
and
lawful
wife
,
at
least
take
and
accept
me
as
thy
slave
,
*NL*
for
so
long
as
I
am
thine
I
will
count
myself
happy
and
fortunate
.
Do
not
*NL*
by
deserting
me
let
my
shame
become
the
talk
of
the
gossips
in
the
*NL*
streets
;
make
not
the
old
age
of
my
parents
miserable
;
for
the
loyal
*NL*
services
they
as
faithful
vassals
have
ever
rendered
thine
are
not
*NL*
deserving
of
such
a
return
;
and
if
thou
thinkest
it
will
debase
thy
blood
*NL*
to
mingle
it
with
mine
,
reflect
that
there
is
little
or
no
nobility
in
*NL*
the
world
that
has
not
travelled
the
same
road
,
and
that
in
illustrious
*NL*
lineages
it
is
not
the
woman
's
blood
that
is
of
account
;
and
,
moreover
,
*NL*
that
true
nobility
consists
in
virtue
,
and
if
thou
art
wanting
in
that
,
*NL*
refusing
me
what
in
justice
thou
owest
me
,
then
even
I
have
higher
claims
*NL*
to
nobility
than
thine
.
To
make
an
end
,
senor
,
these
are
my
last
words
to
*NL*
thee
:
whether
thou
wilt
,
or
wilt
not
,
I
am
thy
wife
;
witness
thy
words
,
*NL*
which
must
not
and
ought
not
to
be
false
,
if
thou
dost
pride
thyself
on
*NL*
that
for
want
of
which
thou
scornest
me
;
witness
the
pledge
which
thou
*NL*
didst
give
me
,
and
witness
Heaven
,
which
thou
thyself
didst
call
to
*NL*
witness
the
promise
thou
hadst
made
me
;
and
if
all
this
fail
,
thy
own
*NL*
conscience
will
not
fail
to
lift
up
its
silent
voice
in
the
midst
of
all
*NL*
thy
gaiety
,
and
vindicate
the
truth
of
what
I
say
and
mar
thy
highest
*NL*
pleasure
and
enjoyment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
and
more
the
injured
Dorothea
delivered
with
such
earnest
*NL*
feeling
and
such
tears
that
all
present
,
even
those
who
came
with
Don
*NL*
Fernando
,
were
constrained
to
join
her
in
them
.
Don
Fernando
listened
to
*NL*
her
without
replying
,
until
,
ceasing
to
speak
,
she
gave
way
to
such
sobs
*NL*
and
sighs
that
it
must
have
been
a
heart
of
brass
that
was
not
softened
*NL*
by
the
sight
of
so
great
sorrow
.
Luscinda
stood
regarding
her
with
no
*NL*
less
compassion
for
her
sufferings
than
admiration
for
her
intelligence
*NL*
and
beauty
,
and
would
have
gone
to
her
to
say
some
words
of
comfort
to
*NL*
her
,
but
was
prevented
by
Don
Fernando
's
grasp
which
held
her
fast
.
He
,
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
confusion
and
astonishment
,
after
regarding
Dorothea
for
*NL*
some
moments
with
a
fixed
gaze
,
opened
his
arms
,
and
,
releasing
Luscinda
,
*NL*
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
conquered
,
fair
Dorothea
,
thou
hast
conquered
,
for
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
have
the
heart
to
deny
the
united
force
of
so
many
truths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Luscinda
in
her
feebleness
was
on
the
point
of
falling
to
the
ground
when
*NL*
Don
Fernando
released
her
,
but
Cardenio
,
who
stood
near
,
having
retreated
*NL*
behind
Don
Fernando
to
escape
recognition
,
casting
fear
aside
and
*NL*
regardless
of
what
might
happen
,
ran
forward
to
support
her
,
and
said
as
*NL*
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
,
``
If
Heaven
in
its
compassion
is
willing
to
*NL*
let
thee
rest
at
last
,
mistress
of
my
heart
,
true
,
constant
,
and
fair
,
*NL*
nowhere
canst
thou
rest
more
safely
than
in
these
arms
that
now
receive
*NL*
thee
,
and
received
thee
before
when
fortune
permitted
me
to
call
thee
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
Luscinda
looked
up
at
Cardenio
,
at
first
beginning
to
*NL*
recognise
him
by
his
voice
and
then
satisfying
herself
by
her
eyes
that
*NL*
it
was
he
,
and
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
,
and
heedless
of
all
*NL*
considerations
of
decorum
,
she
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
*NL*
pressing
her
face
close
to
his
,
said
,
``
Yes
,
my
dear
lord
,
you
are
the
*NL*
true
master
of
this
your
slave
,
even
though
adverse
fate
interpose
again
,
*NL*
and
fresh
dangers
threaten
this
life
that
hangs
on
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
sight
was
this
for
Don
Fernando
and
those
that
stood
around
,
*NL*
filled
with
surprise
at
an
incident
so
unlooked
for
.
Dorothea
fancied
*NL*
that
Don
Fernando
changed
colour
and
looked
as
though
he
meant
to
take
*NL*
vengeance
on
Cardenio
,
for
she
observed
him
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
;
*NL*
and
the
instant
the
idea
struck
her
,
with
wonderful
quickness
she
clasped
*NL*
him
round
the
knees
,
and
kissing
them
and
holding
him
so
as
to
prevent
*NL*
his
moving
,
she
said
,
while
her
tears
continued
to
flow
,
``
What
is
it
thou
*NL*
wouldst
do
,
my
only
refuge
,
in
this
unforeseen
event
?
Thou
hast
thy
wife
*NL*
at
thy
feet
,
and
she
whom
thou
wouldst
have
for
thy
wife
is
in
the
arms
*NL*
of
her
husband
:
reflect
whether
it
will
be
right
for
thee
,
whether
it
*NL*
will
be
possible
for
thee
to
undo
what
Heaven
has
done
,
or
whether
it
*NL*
will
be
becoming
in
thee
to
seek
to
raise
her
to
be
thy
mate
who
in
spite
*NL*
of
every
obstacle
,
and
strong
in
her
truth
and
constancy
,
is
before
thine
*NL*
eyes
,
bathing
with
the
tears
of
love
the
face
and
bosom
of
her
lawful
*NL*
husband
.
For
God
's
sake
I
entreat
of
thee
,
for
thine
own
I
implore
thee
,
*NL*
let
not
this
open
manifestation
rouse
thy
anger
;
but
rather
so
calm
it
as
*NL*
to
allow
these
two
lovers
to
live
in
peace
and
quiet
without
any
*NL*
interference
from
thee
so
long
as
Heaven
permits
them
;
and
in
so
doing
*NL*
thou
wilt
prove
the
generosity
of
thy
lofty
noble
spirit
,
and
the
world
*NL*
shall
see
that
with
thee
reason
has
more
influence
than
passion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
Dorothea
was
speaking
,
Cardenio
,
though
he
held
Luscinda
in
*NL*
his
arms
,
never
took
his
eyes
off
Don
Fernando
,
determined
,
if
he
saw
him
*NL*
make
any
hostile
movement
,
to
try
and
defend
himself
and
resist
as
best
*NL*
he
could
all
who
might
assail
him
,
though
it
should
cost
him
his
life
.
*NL*
But
now
Don
Fernando
's
friends
,
as
well
as
the
curate
and
the
barber
,
who
*NL*
had
been
present
all
the
while
,
not
forgetting
the
worthy
Sancho
Panza
,
*NL*
ran
forward
and
gathered
round
Don
Fernando
,
entreating
him
to
have
*NL*
regard
for
the
tears
of
Dorothea
,
and
not
suffer
her
reasonable
hopes
to
*NL*
be
disappointed
,
since
,
as
they
firmly
believed
,
what
she
said
was
but
*NL*
the
truth
;
and
bidding
him
observe
that
it
was
not
,
as
it
might
seem
,
by
*NL*
accident
,
but
by
a
special
disposition
of
Providence
that
they
had
all
*NL*
met
in
a
place
where
no
one
could
have
expected
a
meeting
.
And
the
curate
*NL*
bade
him
remember
that
only
death
could
part
Luscinda
from
Cardenio
;
that
*NL*
even
if
some
sword
were
to
separate
them
they
would
think
their
death
*NL*
most
happy
;
and
that
in
a
case
that
admitted
of
no
remedy
his
wisest
*NL*
course
was
,
by
conquering
and
putting
a
constraint
upon
himself
,
to
show
*NL*
a
generous
mind
,
and
of
his
own
accord
suffer
these
two
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
happiness
Heaven
had
granted
them
.
He
bade
him
,
too
,
turn
his
eyes
upon
*NL*
the
beauty
of
Dorothea
and
he
would
see
that
few
if
any
could
equal
much
*NL*
less
excel
her
;
while
to
that
beauty
should
be
added
her
modesty
and
the
*NL*
surpassing
love
she
bore
him
.
But
besides
all
this
,
he
reminded
him
that
*NL*
if
he
prided
himself
on
being
a
gentleman
and
a
Christian
,
he
could
not
*NL*
do
otherwise
than
keep
his
plighted
word
;
and
that
in
doing
so
he
would
*NL*
obey
God
and
meet
the
approval
of
all
sensible
people
,
who
know
and
*NL*
recognised
it
to
be
the
privilege
of
beauty
,
even
in
one
of
humble
birth
,
*NL*
provided
virtue
accompany
it
,
to
be
able
to
raise
itself
to
the
level
of
*NL*
any
rank
,
without
any
slur
upon
him
who
places
it
upon
an
equality
with
*NL*
himself
;
and
furthermore
that
when
the
potent
sway
of
passion
asserts
*NL*
itself
,
so
long
as
there
be
no
mixture
of
sin
in
it
,
he
is
not
to
be
*NL*
blamed
who
gives
way
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
brief
,
they
added
to
these
such
other
forcible
arguments
that
Don
*NL*
Fernando
's
manly
heart
,
being
after
all
nourished
by
noble
blood
,
was
*NL*
touched
,
and
yielded
to
the
truth
which
,
even
had
he
wished
it
,
he
could
*NL*
not
gainsay
;
and
he
showed
his
submission
,
and
acceptance
of
the
good
*NL*
advice
that
had
been
offered
to
him
,
by
stooping
down
and
embracing
*NL*
Dorothea
,
saying
to
her
,
``
Rise
,
dear
lady
,
it
is
not
right
that
what
I
*NL*
hold
in
my
heart
should
be
kneeling
at
my
feet
;
and
if
until
now
I
have
*NL*
shown
no
sign
of
what
I
own
,
it
may
have
been
by
Heaven
's
decree
in
order
*NL*
that
,
seeing
the
constancy
with
which
you
love
me
,
I
may
learn
to
value
*NL*
you
as
you
deserve
.
What
I
entreat
of
you
is
that
you
reproach
me
not
*NL*
with
my
transgression
and
grievous
wrong-doing
;
for
the
same
cause
and
*NL*
force
that
drove
me
to
make
you
mine
impelled
me
to
struggle
against
*NL*
being
yours
;
and
to
prove
this
,
turn
and
look
at
the
eyes
of
the
now
*NL*
happy
Luscinda
,
and
you
will
see
in
them
an
excuse
for
all
my
errors
:
and
*NL*
as
she
has
found
and
gained
the
object
of
her
desires
,
and
I
have
found
*NL*
in
you
what
satisfies
all
my
wishes
,
may
she
live
in
peace
and
*NL*
contentment
as
many
happy
years
with
her
Cardenio
,
as
on
my
knees
I
pray
*NL*
Heaven
to
allow
me
to
live
with
my
Dorothea
;
''
and
with
these
words
he
*NL*
once
more
embraced
her
and
pressed
his
face
to
hers
with
so
much
*NL*
tenderness
that
he
had
to
take
great
heed
to
keep
his
tears
from
*NL*
completing
the
proof
of
his
love
and
repentance
in
the
sight
of
all
.
Not
*NL*
so
Luscinda
,
and
Cardenio
,
and
almost
all
the
others
,
for
they
shed
so
*NL*
many
tears
,
some
in
their
own
happiness
,
some
at
that
of
the
others
,
that
*NL*
one
would
have
supposed
a
heavy
calamity
had
fallen
upon
them
all
.
Even
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
was
weeping
;
though
afterwards
he
said
he
only
wept
because
*NL*
he
saw
that
Dorothea
was
not
as
he
fancied
the
queen
Micomicona
,
of
whom
*NL*
he
expected
such
great
favours
.
Their
wonder
as
well
as
their
weeping
*NL*
lasted
some
time
,
and
then
Cardenio
and
Luscinda
went
and
fell
on
their
*NL*
knees
before
Don
Fernando
,
returning
him
thanks
for
the
favour
he
had
*NL*
rendered
them
in
language
so
grateful
that
he
knew
not
how
to
answer
*NL*
them
,
and
raising
them
up
embraced
them
with
every
mark
of
affection
and
*NL*
courtesy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
asked
Dorothea
how
she
had
managed
to
reach
a
place
so
far
*NL*
removed
from
her
own
home
,
and
she
in
a
few
fitting
words
told
all
that
*NL*
she
had
previously
related
to
Cardenio
,
with
which
Don
Fernando
and
his
*NL*
companions
were
so
delighted
that
they
wished
the
story
had
been
longer
;
*NL*
so
charmingly
did
Dorothea
describe
her
misadventures
.
When
she
had
*NL*
finished
Don
Fernando
recounted
what
had
befallen
him
in
the
city
after
*NL*
he
had
found
in
Luscinda
's
bosom
the
paper
in
which
she
declared
that
she
*NL*
was
Cardenio
's
wife
,
and
never
could
be
his
.
He
said
he
meant
to
kill
*NL*
her
,
and
would
have
done
so
had
he
not
been
prevented
by
her
parents
,
and
*NL*
that
he
quitted
the
house
full
of
rage
and
shame
,
and
resolved
to
avenge
*NL*
himself
when
a
more
convenient
opportunity
should
offer
.
The
next
day
he
*NL*
learned
that
Luscinda
had
disappeared
from
her
father
's
house
,
and
that
*NL*
no
one
could
tell
whither
she
had
gone
.
Finally
,
at
the
end
of
some
*NL*
months
he
ascertained
that
she
was
in
a
convent
and
meant
to
remain
there
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
her
life
,
if
she
were
not
to
share
it
with
Cardenio
;
and
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
had
learned
this
,
taking
these
three
gentlemen
as
his
*NL*
companions
,
he
arrived
at
the
place
where
she
was
,
but
avoided
speaking
*NL*
to
her
,
fearing
that
if
it
were
known
he
was
there
stricter
precautions
*NL*
would
be
taken
in
the
convent
;
and
watching
a
time
when
the
porter
's
*NL*
lodge
was
open
he
left
two
to
guard
the
gate
,
and
he
and
the
other
*NL*
entered
the
convent
in
quest
of
Luscinda
,
whom
they
found
in
the
*NL*
cloisters
in
conversation
with
one
of
the
nuns
,
and
carrying
her
off
*NL*
without
giving
her
time
to
resist
,
they
reached
a
place
with
her
where
*NL*
they
provided
themselves
with
what
they
required
for
taking
her
away
;
all
*NL*
which
they
were
able
to
do
in
complete
safety
,
as
the
convent
was
in
the
*NL*
country
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
city
.
He
added
that
when
*NL*
Luscinda
found
herself
in
his
power
she
lost
all
consciousness
,
and
after
*NL*
returning
to
herself
did
nothing
but
weep
and
sigh
without
speaking
a
*NL*
word
;
and
thus
in
silence
and
tears
they
reached
that
inn
,
which
for
him
*NL*
was
reaching
heaven
where
all
the
mischances
of
earth
are
over
and
at
an
*NL*
end
.

CHAPTER
XXXVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
IS
CONTINUED
THE
STORY
OF
THE
FAMOUS
PRINCESS
MICOMICONA
,
WITH
*NL*
OTHER
DROLL
ADVENTURES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
Sancho
listened
with
no
little
sorrow
at
heart
to
see
how
his
*NL*
hopes
of
dignity
were
fading
away
and
vanishing
in
smoke
,
and
how
the
*NL*
fair
Princess
Micomicona
had
turned
into
Dorothea
,
and
the
giant
into
Don
*NL*
Fernando
,
while
his
master
was
sleeping
tranquilly
,
totally
unconscious
*NL*
of
all
that
had
come
to
pass
.
Dorothea
was
unable
to
persuade
herself
*NL*
that
her
present
happiness
was
not
all
a
dream
;
Cardenio
was
in
a
similar
*NL*
state
of
mind
,
and
Luscinda
's
thoughts
ran
in
the
same
direction
.
Don
*NL*
Fernando
gave
thanks
to
Heaven
for
the
favour
shown
to
him
and
for
having
*NL*
been
rescued
from
the
intricate
labyrinth
in
which
he
had
been
brought
so
*NL*
near
the
destruction
of
his
good
name
and
of
his
soul
;
and
in
short
*NL*
everybody
in
the
inn
was
full
of
contentment
and
satisfaction
at
the
*NL*
happy
issue
of
such
a
complicated
and
hopeless
business
.
The
curate
as
a
*NL*
sensible
man
made
sound
reflections
upon
the
whole
affair
,
and
*NL*
congratulated
each
upon
his
good
fortune
;
but
the
one
that
was
in
the
*NL*
highest
spirits
and
good
humour
was
the
landlady
,
because
of
the
promise
*NL*
Cardenio
and
the
curate
had
given
her
to
pay
for
all
the
losses
and
*NL*
damage
she
had
sustained
through
Don
Quixote
's
means
.
Sancho
,
as
has
been
*NL*
already
said
,
was
the
only
one
who
was
distressed
,
unhappy
,
and
dejected
;
*NL*
and
so
with
a
long
face
he
went
in
to
his
master
,
who
had
just
awoke
,
and
*NL*
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Rueful
Countenance
,
your
worship
may
as
well
sleep
on
as
much
as
you
*NL*
like
,
without
troubling
yourself
about
killing
any
giant
or
restoring
her
*NL*
kingdom
to
the
princess
;
for
that
is
all
over
and
settled
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
was
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
I
have
had
the
most
*NL*
prodigious
and
stupendous
battle
with
the
giant
that
I
ever
remember
*NL*
having
had
all
the
days
of
my
life
;
and
with
one
back-stroke-swish
!
--
I
*NL*
brought
his
head
tumbling
to
the
ground
,
and
so
much
blood
gushed
forth
*NL*
from
him
that
it
ran
in
rivulets
over
the
earth
like
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
red
wine
,
your
worship
had
better
say
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
for
I
*NL*
would
have
you
know
,
if
you
do
n't
know
it
,
that
the
dead
giant
is
a
*NL*
hacked
wine-skin
,
and
the
blood
four-and-twenty
gallons
of
red
wine
that
*NL*
it
had
in
its
belly
,
and
the
cut-off
head
is
the
bitch
that
bore
me
;
and
*NL*
the
devil
take
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
thou
talking
about
,
fool
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
art
thou
in
thy
*NL*
senses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
your
worship
get
up
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
you
will
see
the
nice
*NL*
business
you
have
made
of
it
,
and
what
we
have
to
pay
;
and
you
will
see
*NL*
the
queen
turned
into
a
private
lady
called
Dorothea
,
and
other
things
*NL*
that
will
astonish
you
,
if
you
understand
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
be
surprised
at
anything
of
the
kind
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
``
for
if
thou
dost
remember
the
last
time
we
were
here
I
told
thee
that
*NL*
everything
that
happened
here
was
a
matter
of
enchantment
,
and
it
would
*NL*
be
no
wonder
if
it
were
the
same
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
believe
all
that
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
if
my
blanketing
was
the
*NL*
same
sort
of
thing
also
;
only
it
was
n't
,
but
real
and
genuine
;
for
I
saw
*NL*
the
landlord
,
Who
is
here
to-day
,
holding
one
end
of
the
blanket
and
*NL*
jerking
me
up
to
the
skies
very
neatly
and
smartly
,
and
with
as
much
*NL*
laughter
as
strength
;
and
when
it
comes
to
be
a
case
of
knowing
people
,
I
*NL*
hold
for
my
part
,
simple
and
sinner
as
I
am
,
that
there
is
no
enchantment
*NL*
about
it
at
all
,
but
a
great
deal
of
bruising
and
bad
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
God
will
give
a
remedy
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
hand
me
my
*NL*
clothes
and
let
me
go
out
,
for
I
want
to
see
these
transformations
and
*NL*
things
thou
speakest
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
fetched
him
his
clothes
;
and
while
he
was
dressing
,
the
curate
*NL*
gave
Don
Fernando
and
the
others
present
an
account
of
Don
Quixote
's
*NL*
madness
and
of
the
stratagem
they
had
made
use
of
to
withdraw
him
from
*NL*
that
Pena
Pobre
where
he
fancied
himself
stationed
because
of
his
lady
's
*NL*
scorn
.
He
described
to
them
also
nearly
all
the
adventures
that
Sancho
*NL*
had
mentioned
,
at
which
they
marvelled
and
laughed
not
a
little
,
thinking
*NL*
it
,
as
all
did
,
the
strangest
form
of
madness
a
crazy
intellect
could
be
*NL*
capable
of
.
But
now
,
the
curate
said
,
that
the
lady
Dorothea
's
good
*NL*
fortune
prevented
her
from
proceeding
with
their
purpose
,
it
would
be
*NL*
necessary
to
devise
or
discover
some
other
way
of
getting
him
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cardenio
proposed
to
carry
out
the
scheme
they
had
begun
,
and
suggested
*NL*
that
Luscinda
would
act
and
support
Dorothea
's
part
sufficiently
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Don
Fernando
,
``
that
must
not
be
,
for
I
want
Dorothea
to
follow
*NL*
out
this
idea
of
hers
;
and
if
the
worthy
gentleman
's
village
is
not
very
*NL*
far
off
,
I
shall
be
happy
if
I
can
do
anything
for
his
relief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
more
than
two
days
'
journey
from
this
,
''
said
the
curate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
if
it
were
more
,
''
said
Don
Fernando
,
``
I
would
gladly
travel
so
far
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
doing
so
good
a
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
moment
Don
Quixote
came
out
in
full
panoply
,
with
Mambrino
's
*NL*
helmet
,
all
dinted
as
it
was
,
on
his
head
,
his
buckler
on
his
arm
,
and
*NL*
leaning
on
his
staff
or
pike
.
The
strange
figure
he
presented
filled
Don
*NL*
Fernando
and
the
rest
with
amazement
as
they
contemplated
his
lean
yellow
*NL*
face
half
a
league
long
,
his
armour
of
all
sorts
,
and
the
solemnity
of
*NL*
his
deportment
.
They
stood
silent
waiting
to
see
what
he
would
say
,
and
*NL*
he
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
air
Dorothea
,
addressed
her
with
great
gravity
*NL*
and
composure
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
informed
,
fair
lady
,
by
my
squire
here
that
your
greatness
has
been
*NL*
annihilated
and
your
being
abolished
,
since
,
from
a
queen
and
lady
of
*NL*
high
degree
as
you
used
to
be
,
you
have
been
turned
into
a
private
*NL*
maiden
.
If
this
has
been
done
by
the
command
of
the
magician
king
your
*NL*
father
,
through
fear
that
I
should
not
afford
you
the
aid
you
need
and
*NL*
are
entitled
to
,
I
may
tell
you
he
did
not
know
and
does
not
know
half
*NL*
the
mass
,
and
was
little
versed
in
the
annals
of
chivalry
;
for
,
if
he
had
*NL*
read
and
gone
through
them
as
attentively
and
deliberately
as
I
have
,
he
*NL*
would
have
found
at
every
turn
that
knights
of
less
renown
than
mine
have
*NL*
accomplished
things
more
difficult
:
it
is
no
great
matter
to
kill
a
whelp
*NL*
of
a
giant
,
however
arrogant
he
may
be
;
for
it
is
not
many
hours
since
I
*NL*
myself
was
engaged
with
one
,
and-I
will
not
speak
of
it
,
that
they
may
*NL*
not
say
I
am
lying
;
time
,
however
,
that
reveals
all
,
will
tell
the
tale
*NL*
when
we
least
expect
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
engaged
with
a
couple
of
wine-skins
,
and
not
a
giant
,
''
said
the
*NL*
landlord
at
this
;
but
Don
Fernando
told
him
to
hold
his
tongue
and
on
no
*NL*
account
interrupt
Don
Quixote
,
who
continued
,
``
I
say
in
conclusion
,
high
*NL*
and
disinherited
lady
,
that
if
your
father
has
brought
about
this
*NL*
metamorphosis
in
your
person
for
the
reason
I
have
mentioned
,
you
ought
*NL*
not
to
attach
any
importance
to
it
;
for
there
is
no
peril
on
earth
*NL*
through
which
my
sword
will
not
force
a
way
,
and
with
it
,
before
many
*NL*
days
are
over
,
I
will
bring
your
enemy
's
head
to
the
ground
and
place
on
*NL*
yours
the
crown
of
your
kingdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
said
no
more
,
and
waited
for
the
reply
of
the
princess
,
who
*NL*
aware
of
Don
Fernando
's
determination
to
carry
on
the
deception
until
Don
*NL*
Quixote
had
been
conveyed
to
his
home
,
with
great
ease
of
manner
and
*NL*
gravity
made
answer
,
``
Whoever
told
you
,
valiant
Knight
of
the
Rueful
*NL*
Countenance
,
that
I
had
undergone
any
change
or
transformation
did
not
*NL*
tell
you
the
truth
,
for
I
am
the
same
as
I
was
yesterday
.
It
is
true
that
*NL*
certain
strokes
of
good
fortune
,
that
have
given
me
more
than
I
could
*NL*
have
hoped
for
,
have
made
some
alteration
in
me
;
but
I
have
not
therefore
*NL*
ceased
to
be
what
I
was
before
,
or
to
entertain
the
same
desire
I
have
*NL*
had
all
through
of
availing
myself
of
the
might
of
your
valiant
and
*NL*
invincible
arm
.
And
so
,
senor
,
let
your
goodness
reinstate
the
father
*NL*
that
begot
me
in
your
good
opinion
,
and
be
assured
that
he
was
a
wise
and
*NL*
prudent
man
,
since
by
his
craft
he
found
out
such
a
sure
and
easy
way
of
*NL*
remedying
my
misfortune
;
for
I
believe
,
senor
,
that
had
it
not
been
for
*NL*
you
I
should
never
have
lit
upon
the
good
fortune
I
now
possess
;
and
in
*NL*
this
I
am
saying
what
is
perfectly
true
;
as
most
of
these
gentlemen
who
*NL*
are
present
can
fully
testify
.
All
that
remains
is
to
set
out
on
our
*NL*
journey
to-morrow
,
for
to-day
we
could
not
make
much
way
;
and
for
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
happy
result
I
am
looking
forward
to
,
I
trust
to
God
and
the
*NL*
valour
of
your
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
said
the
sprightly
Dorothea
,
and
on
hearing
her
Don
Quixote
turned
to
*NL*
Sancho
,
and
said
to
him
,
with
an
angry
air
,
``
I
declare
now
,
little
*NL*
Sancho
,
thou
art
the
greatest
little
villain
in
Spain
.
Say
,
thief
and
*NL*
vagabond
,
hast
thou
not
just
now
told
me
that
this
princess
had
been
*NL*
turned
into
a
maiden
called
Dorothea
,
and
that
the
head
which
I
am
*NL*
persuaded
I
cut
off
from
a
giant
was
the
bitch
that
bore
thee
,
and
other
*NL*
nonsense
that
put
me
in
the
greatest
perplexity
I
have
ever
been
in
all
*NL*
my
life
?
I
vow
''
-LRB-
and
here
he
looked
to
heaven
and
ground
his
teeth
-RRB-
``
I
*NL*
have
a
mind
to
play
the
mischief
with
thee
,
in
a
way
that
will
teach
*NL*
sense
for
the
future
to
all
lying
squires
of
knights-errant
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
your
worship
be
calm
,
senor
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
for
it
may
well
be
*NL*
that
I
have
been
mistaken
as
to
the
change
of
the
lady
princess
*NL*
Micomicona
;
but
as
to
the
giant
's
head
,
or
at
least
as
to
the
piercing
of
*NL*
the
wine-skins
,
and
the
blood
being
red
wine
,
I
make
no
mistake
,
as
sure
*NL*
as
there
is
a
God
;
because
the
wounded
skins
are
there
at
the
head
of
*NL*
your
worship
's
bed
,
and
the
wine
has
made
a
lake
of
the
room
;
if
not
you
*NL*
will
see
when
the
eggs
come
to
be
fried
;
I
mean
when
his
worship
the
*NL*
landlord
calls
for
all
the
damages
:
for
the
rest
,
I
am
heartily
glad
that
*NL*
her
ladyship
the
queen
is
as
she
was
,
for
it
concerns
me
as
much
as
*NL*
anyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
thee
again
,
Sancho
,
thou
art
a
fool
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
forgive
*NL*
me
,
and
that
will
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
''
said
Don
Fernando
;
``
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
;
and
as
*NL*
her
ladyship
the
princess
proposes
to
set
out
to-morrow
because
it
is
too
*NL*
late
to-day
,
so
be
it
,
and
we
will
pass
the
night
in
pleasant
*NL*
conversation
,
and
to-morrow
we
will
all
accompany
Senor
Don
Quixote
;
for
*NL*
we
wish
to
witness
the
valiant
and
unparalleled
achievements
he
is
about
*NL*
to
perform
in
the
course
of
this
mighty
enterprise
which
he
has
*NL*
undertaken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
who
shall
wait
upon
and
accompany
you
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
I
*NL*
am
much
gratified
by
the
favour
that
is
bestowed
upon
me
,
and
the
good
*NL*
opinion
entertained
of
me
,
which
I
shall
strive
to
justify

it
shall
*NL*
cost
me
my
life
,
or
even
more
,
if
it
can
possibly
cost
me
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Many
were
the
compliments
and
expressions
of
politeness
that
passed
*NL*
between
Don
Quixote
and
Don
Fernando
;
but
they
were
brought
to
an
end
by
*NL*
a
traveller
who
at
this
moment
entered
the
inn
,
and
who
seemed
from
his
*NL*
attire
to
be
a
Christian
lately
come
from
the
country
of
the
Moors
,
for
*NL*
he
was
dressed
in
a
short-skirted
coat
of
blue
cloth
with
half-sleeves
*NL*
and
without
a
collar
;
his
breeches
were
also
of
blue
cloth
,
and
his
cap
*NL*
of
the
same
colour
,
and
he
wore
yellow
buskins
and
had
a
Moorish
cutlass
*NL*
slung
from
a
baldric
across
his
breast
.
Behind
him
,
mounted
upon
an
ass
,
*NL*
there
came
a
woman
dressed
in
Moorish
fashion
,
with
her
face
veiled
and
a
*NL*
scarf
on
her
head
,
and
wearing
a
little
brocaded
cap
,
and
a
mantle
that
*NL*
covered
her
from
her
shoulders
to
her
feet
.
The
man
was
of
a
robust
and
*NL*
well-proportioned
frame
,
in
age
a
little
over
forty
,
rather
swarthy
in
*NL*
complexion
,
with
long
moustaches
and
a
full
beard
,
and
,
in
short
,
his
*NL*
appearance
was
such
that
if
he
had
been
well
dressed
he
would
have
been
*NL*
taken
for
a
person
of
quality
and
good
birth
.
On
entering
he
asked
for
a
*NL*
room
,
and
when
they
told
him
there
was
none
in
the
inn
he
seemed
*NL*
distressed
,
and
approaching
her
who
by
her
dress
seemed
to
be
a
Moor
he
*NL*
her
down
from
saddle
in
his
arms
.
Luscinda
,
Dorothea
,
the
landlady
,
her
*NL*
daughter
and
Maritornes
,
attracted
by
the
strange
,
and
to
them
entirely
*NL*
new
costume
,
gathered
round
her
;
and
Dorothea
,
who
was
always
kindly
,
*NL*
courteous
,
and
quick-witted
,
perceiving
that
both
she
and
the
man
who
had
*NL*
brought
her
were
annoyed
at
not
finding
a
room
,
said
to
her
,
``
Do
not
be
*NL*
put
out
,
senora
,
by
the
discomfort
and
want
of
luxuries
here
,
for
it
is
*NL*
the
way
of
road-side
inns
to
be
without
them
;
still
,
if
you
will
be
*NL*
pleased
to
share
our
lodging
with
us
-LRB-
pointing
to
Luscinda
-RRB-
perhaps
you
*NL*
will
have
found
worse
accommodation
in
the
course
of
your
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
veiled
lady
made
no
reply
;
all
she
did
was
to
rise
from
her
*NL*
seat
,
crossing
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
,
bowing
her
head
and
bending
her
*NL*
body
as
a
sign
that
she
returned
thanks
.
From
her
silence
they
concluded
*NL*
that
she
must
be
a
Moor
and
unable
to
speak
a
Christian
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
captive
came
up
,
having
been
until
now
otherwise
*NL*
engaged
,
and
seeing
that
they
all
stood
round
his
companion
and
that
she
*NL*
made
no
reply
to
what
they
addressed
to
her
,
he
said
,
``
Ladies
,
this
*NL*
damsel
hardly
understands
my
language
and
can
speak
none
but
that
of
her
*NL*
own
country
,
for
which
reason
she
does
not
and
can
not
answer
what
has
*NL*
been
asked
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
has
been
asked
of
her
,
''
returned
Luscinda
;
``
she
has
only
been
*NL*
offered
our
company
for
this
evening
and
a
share
of
the
quarters
we
*NL*
occupy
,
where
she
shall
be
made
as
comfortable
as
the
circumstances
*NL*
allow
,
with
the
good-will
we
are
bound
to
show
all
strangers
that
stand
*NL*
in
need
of
it
,
especially
if
it
be
a
woman
to
whom
the
service
is
*NL*
rendered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
her
part
and
my
own
,
senora
,
''
replied
the
captive
,
``
I
kiss
your
*NL*
hands
,
and
I
esteem
highly
,
as
I
ought
,
the
favour
you
have
offered
,
*NL*
which
,
on
such
an
occasion
and
coming
from
persons
of
your
appearance
,
*NL*
is
,
it
is
plain
to
see
,
a
very
great
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
senor
,
''
said
Dorothea
,
``
is
this
lady
a
Christian
or
a
Moor
?
for
*NL*
her
dress
and
her
silence
lead
us
to
imagine
that
she
is
what
we
could
*NL*
wish
she
was
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
dress
and
outwardly
,
''
said
he
,
``
she
is
a
Moor
,
but
at
heart
she
is
a
*NL*
thoroughly
good
Christian
,
for
she
has
the
greatest
desire
to
become
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
has
not
been
baptised
?
''
returned
Luscinda
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
been
no
opportunity
for
that
,
''
replied
the
captive
,
``
since
she
*NL*
left
Algiers
,
her
native
country
and
home
;
and
up
to
the
present
she
has
*NL*
not
found
herself
in
any
such
imminent
danger
of
death
as
to
make
it
*NL*
necessary
to
baptise
her
before
she
has
been
instructed
in
all
the
*NL*
ceremonies
our
holy
mother
Church
ordains
;
but
,
please
God
,
ere
long
she
*NL*
shall
be
baptised
with
the
solemnity
befitting
her
which
is
higher
than
*NL*
her
dress
or
mine
indicates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
these
words
he
excited
a
desire
in
all
who
heard
him
,
to
know
who
the
*NL*
Moorish
lady
and
the
captive
were
,
but
no
one
liked
to
ask
just
then
,
*NL*
seeing
that
it
was
a
fitter
moment
for
helping
them
to
rest
themselves
*NL*
than
for
questioning
them
about
their
lives
.
Dorothea
took
the
Moorish
*NL*
lady
by
the
hand
and
leading
her
to
a
seat
beside
herself
,
requested
her
*NL*
to
remove
her
veil
.
She
looked
at
the
captive
as
if
to
ask
him
what
they
*NL*
meant
and
what
she
was
to
do
.
He
said
to
her
in
Arabic
that
they
asked
*NL*
her
to
take
off
her
veil
,
and
thereupon
she
removed
it
and
disclosed
a
*NL*
countenance
so
lovely
,
that
to
Dorothea
she
seemed
more
beautiful
than
*NL*
Luscinda
,
and
to
Luscinda
more
beautiful
than
Dorothea
,
and
all
the
*NL*
bystanders
felt
that
if
any
beauty
could
compare
with
theirs
it
was
the
*NL*
Moorish
lady
's
,
and
there
were
even
those
who
were
inclined
to
give
it
*NL*
somewhat
the
preference
.
And
as
it
is
the
privilege
and
charm
of
beauty
*NL*
to
win
the
heart
and
secure
good-will
,
all
forthwith
became
eager
to
show
*NL*
kindness
and
attention
to
the
lovely
Moor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Fernando
asked
the
captive
what
her
name
was
,
and
he
replied
that
it
*NL*
was
Lela
Zoraida
;
but
the
instant
she
heard
him
,
she
guessed
what
the
*NL*
Christian
had
asked
,
and
said
hastily
,
with
some
displeasure
and
energy
,
*NL*
``
No
,
not
Zoraida
;
Maria
,
Maria
!
''
giving
them
to
understand
that
she
was
*NL*
called
``
Maria
''
and
not
``
Zoraida
.
''
These
words
,
and
the
touching
*NL*
earnestness
with
which
she
uttered
them
,
drew
more
than
one
tear
from
*NL*
some
of
the
listeners
,
particularly
the
women
,
who
are
by
nature
*NL*
tender-hearted
and
compassionate
.
Luscinda
embraced
her
affectionately
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
Yes
,
yes
,
Maria
,
Maria
,
''
to
which
the
Moor
replied
,
``
Yes
,
yes
,
*NL*
Maria
;
Zoraida
macange
,
''
which
means
``
not
Zoraida
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Night
was
now
approaching
,
and
by
the
orders
of
those
who
accompanied
Don
*NL*
Fernando
the
landlord
had
taken
care
and
pains
to
prepare
for
them
the
*NL*
best
supper
that
was
in
his
power
.
The
hour
therefore
having
arrived
they
*NL*
all
took
their
seats
at
a
long
table
like
a
refectory
one
,
for
round
or
*NL*
square
table
there
was
none
in
the
inn
,
and
the
seat
of
honour
at
the
*NL*
head
of
it
,
though
he
was
for
refusing
it
,
they
assigned
to
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
who
desired
the
lady
Micomicona
to
place
herself
by
his
side
,
as
he
was
*NL*
her
protector
.
Luscinda
and
Zoraida
took
their
places
next
her
,
opposite
*NL*
to
them
were
Don
Fernando
and
Cardenio
,
and
next
the
captive
and
the
*NL*
other
gentlemen
,
and
by
the
side
of
the
ladies
,
the
curate
and
the
*NL*
barber
.
And
so
they
supped
in
high
enjoyment
,
which
was
increased
when
*NL*
they
observed
Don
Quixote
leave
off
eating
,
and
,
moved
by
an
impulse
like
*NL*
that
which
made
him
deliver
himself
at
such
length
when
he
supped
with
*NL*
the
goatherds
,
begin
to
address
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Verily
,
gentlemen
,
if
we
reflect
upon
it
,
great
and
marvellous
are
the
*NL*
things
they
see
,
who
make
profession
of
the
order
of
knight-errantry
.
*NL*
Say
,
what
being
is
there
in
this
world
,
who
entering
the
gate
of
this
*NL*
castle
at
this
moment
,
and
seeing
us
as
we
are
here
,
would
suppose
or
*NL*
imagine
us
to
be
what
we
are
?
Who
would
say
that
this
lady
who
is
beside
*NL*
me
was
the
great
queen
that
we
all
know
her
to
be
,
or
that
I
am
that
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
trumpeted
far
and
wide
by
the
mouth
of
*NL*
Fame
?
Now
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
art
and
calling
surpasses
all
*NL*
those
that
mankind
has
invented
,
and
is
the
more
deserving
of
being
held
*NL*
in
honour
in
proportion
as
it
is
the
more
exposed
to
peril
.
Away
with
*NL*
those
who
assert
that
letters
have
the
preeminence
over
arms
;
I
will
tell
*NL*
them
,
whosoever
they
may
be
,
that
they
know
not
what
they
say
.
For
the
*NL*
reason
which
such
persons
commonly
assign
,
and
upon
which
they
chiefly
*NL*
rest
,
is
,
that
the
labours
of
the
mind
are
greater
than
those
of
the
*NL*
body
,
and
that
arms
give
employment
to
the
body
alone
;
as
if
the
calling
*NL*
were
a
porter
's
trade
,
for
which
nothing
more
is
required
than
sturdy
*NL*
strength
;
or
as
if
,
in
what
we
who
profess
them
call
arms
,
there
were
not
*NL*
included
acts
of
vigour
for
the
execution
of
which
high
intelligence
is
*NL*
requisite
;
or
as
if
the
soul
of
the
warrior
,
when
he
has
an
army
,
or
the
*NL*
defence
of
a
city
under
his
care
,
did
not
exert
itself
as
much
by
mind
as
*NL*
by
body
.
Nay
;
see
whether
by
bodily
strength
it
be
possible
to
learn
or
*NL*
divine
the
intentions
of
the
enemy
,
his
plans
,
stratagems
,
or
obstacles
,
*NL*
or
to
ward
off
impending
mischief
;
for
all
these
are
the
work
of
the
*NL*
mind
,
and
in
them
the
body
has
no
share
whatever
.
Since
,
therefore
,
arms
*NL*
have
need
of
the
mind
,
as
much
as
letters
,
let
us
see
now
which
of
the
*NL*
two
minds
,
that
of
the
man
of
letters
or
that
of
the
warrior
,
has
most
to
*NL*
do
;
and
this
will
be
seen
by
the
end
and
goal
that
each
seeks
to
attain
;
*NL*
for
that
purpose
is
the
more
estimable
which
has
for
its
aim
the
nobler
*NL*
object
.
The
end
and
goal
of
letters
--
I
am
not
speaking
now
of
divine
*NL*
letters
,
the
aim
of
which
is
to
raise
and
direct
the
soul
to
Heaven
;
for
*NL*
with
an
end
so
infinite
no
other
can
be
compared
--
I
speak
of
human
*NL*
letters
,
the
end
of
which
is
to
establish
distributive
justice
,
give
to
*NL*
every
man
that
which
is
his
,
and
see
and
take
care
that
good
laws
are
*NL*
observed
:
an
end
undoubtedly
noble
,
lofty
,
and
deserving
of
high
praise
,
*NL*
but
not
such
as
should
be
given
to
that
sought
by
arms
,
which
have
for
*NL*
their
end
and
object
peace
,
the
greatest
boon
that
men
can
desire
in
this
*NL*
life
.
The
first
good
news
the
world
and
mankind
received
was
that
which
*NL*
the
angels
announced
on
the
night
that
was
our
day
,
when
they
sang
in
the
*NL*
air
,
`
Glory
to
God
in
the
highest
,
and
peace
on
earth
to
men
of
*NL*
good-will
;
'
and
the
salutation
which
the
great
Master
of
heaven
and
earth
*NL*
taught
his
disciples
and
chosen
followers
when
they
entered
any
house
,
*NL*
was
to
say
,
`
Peace
be
on
this
house
;
'
and
many
other
times
he
said
to
*NL*
them
,
`
My
peace
I
give
unto
you
,
my
peace
I
leave
you
,
peace
be
with
*NL*
you
;
'
a
jewel
and
a
precious
gift
given
and
left
by
such
a
hand
:
a
jewel
*NL*
without
which
there
can
be
no
happiness
either
on
earth
or
in
heaven
.
*NL*
This
peace
is
the
true
end
of
war
;
and
war
is
only
another
name
for
arms
.
*NL*
This
,
then
,
being
admitted
,
that
the
end
of
war
is
peace
,
and
that
so
far
*NL*
it
has
the
advantage
of
the
end
of
letters
,
let
us
turn
to
the
bodily
*NL*
labours
of
the
man
of
letters
,
and
those
of
him
who
follows
the
*NL*
profession
of
arms
,
and
see
which
are
the
greater
.

*NL*
Don
Quixote
delivered
his
discourse
in
such
a
manner
and
in
such
correct
*NL*
language
,
that
for
the
time
being
he
made
it
impossible
for
any
of
his
*NL*
hearers
to
consider
him
a
madman
;
on
the
contrary
,
as
they
were
mostly
*NL*
gentlemen
,
to
whom
arms
are
an
appurtenance
by
birth
,
they
listened
to
*NL*
him
with
great
pleasure
as
he
continued
:
``
Here
,
then
,
I
say
is
what
the
*NL*
student
has
to
undergo
;
first
of
all
poverty
:
not
that
all
are
poor
,
but
*NL*
to
put
the
case
as
strongly
as
possible
:
and
when
I
have
said
that
he
*NL*
endures
poverty
,
I
think
nothing
more
need
be
said
about
his
hard
*NL*
fortune
,
for
he
who
is
poor
has
no
share
of
the
good
things
of
life
.
This
*NL*
poverty
he
suffers
from
in
various
ways
,
hunger
,
or
cold
,
or
nakedness
,
*NL*
or
all
together
;
but
for
all
that
it
is
not
so
extreme
but
that
he
gets
*NL*
something
to
eat
,
though
it
may
be
at
somewhat
unseasonable
hours
and
*NL*
from
the
leavings
of
the
rich
;
for
the
greatest
misery
of
the
student
is
*NL*
what
they
themselves
call
`
going
out
for
soup
,
'
and
there
is
always
some
*NL*
neighbour
's
brazier
or
hearth
for
them
,
which
,
if
it
does
not
warm
,
at
*NL*
least
tempers
the
cold
to
them
,
and
lastly
,
they
sleep
comfortably
at
*NL*
night
under
a
roof
.
I
will
not
go
into
other
particulars
,
as
for
example
*NL*
want
of
shirts
,
and
no
superabundance
of
shoes
,
thin
and
threadbare
*NL*
garments
,
and
gorging
themselves
to
surfeit
in
their
voracity
when
good
*NL*
luck
has
treated
them
to
a
banquet
of
some
sort
.
By
this
road
that
I
have
*NL*
described
,
rough
and
hard
,
stumbling
here
,
falling
there
,
getting
up
*NL*
again
to
fall
again
,
they
reach
the
rank
they
desire
,
and
that
once
*NL*
attained
,
we
have
seen
many
who
have
passed
these
Syrtes
and
Scyllas
and
*NL*
Charybdises
,
as
if
borne
flying
on
the
wings
of
favouring
fortune
;
we
*NL*
have
seen
them
,
I
say
,
ruling
and
governing
the
world
from
a
chair
,
their
*NL*
hunger
turned
into
satiety
,
their
cold
into
comfort
,
their
nakedness
into
*NL*
fine
raiment
,
their
sleep
on
a
mat
into
repose
in
holland
and
damask
,
the
*NL*
justly
earned
reward
of
their
virtue
;
but
,
contrasted
and
compared
with
*NL*
what
the
warrior
undergoes
,
all
they
have
undergone
falls
far
short
of
*NL*
it
,
as
I
am
now
about
to
show

CHAPTER
XXXVIII

*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
THE
CURIOUS
DISCOURSE
DON
QUIXOTE
DELIVERED
ON
ARMS
AND
*NL*
LETTERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Continuing
his
discourse
Don
Quixote
said
:
``
As
we
began
in
the
student
's
*NL*
case
with
poverty
and
its
accompaniments
,
let
us
see
now
if
the
soldier
*NL*
is
richer
,
and
we
shall
find
that
in
poverty
itself
there
is
no
one
*NL*
poorer
;
for
he
is
dependent
on
his
miserable
pay
,
which
comes
late
or
*NL*
never
,
or
else
on
what
he
can
plunder
,
seriously
imperilling
his
life
and
*NL*
conscience
;
and
sometimes
his
nakedness
will
be
so
great
that
a
slashed
*NL*
doublet
serves
him
for
uniform
and
shirt
,
and
in
the
depth
of
winter
he
*NL*
has
to
defend
himself
against
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
in
the
open
*NL*
field
with
nothing
better
than
the
breath
of
his
mouth
,
which
I
need
not
*NL*
say
,
coming
from
an
empty
place
,
must
come
out
cold
,
contrary
to
the
laws
*NL*
of
nature
.
To
be
sure
he
looks
forward
to
the
approach
of
night
to
make
*NL*
up
for
all
these
discomforts
on
the
bed
that
awaits
him
,
which
,
unless
by
*NL*
some
fault
of
his
,
never
sins
by
being
over
narrow
,
for
he
can
easily
*NL*
measure
out
on
the
ground
as
he
likes
,
and
roll
himself
about
in
it
to
*NL*
his
heart
's
content
without
any
fear
of
the
sheets
slipping
away
from
*NL*
him
.
Then
,
after
all
this
,
suppose
the
day
and
hour
for
taking
his
degree
*NL*
in
his
calling
to
have
come
;
suppose
the
day
of
battle
to
have
arrived
,
*NL*
when
they
invest
him
with
the
doctor
's
cap
made
of
lint
,
to
mend
some
*NL*
bullet-hole
,
perhaps
,
that
has
gone
through
his
temples
,
or
left
him
with
*NL*
a
crippled
arm
or
leg
.
Or
if
this
does
not
happen
,
and
merciful
Heaven
*NL*
watches
over
him
and
keeps
him
safe
and
sound
,
it
may
be
he
will
be
in
*NL*
the
same
poverty
he
was
in
before
,
and
he
must
go
through
more
*NL*
engagements
and
more
battles
,
and
come
victorious
out
of
all
before
he
*NL*
betters
himself
;
but
miracles
of
that
sort
are
seldom
seen
.
For
tell
me
,
*NL*
sirs
,
if
you
have
ever
reflected
upon
it
,
by
how
much
do
those
who
have
*NL*
gained
by
war
fall
short
of
the
number
of
those
who
have
perished
in
it
?
*NL*
No
doubt
you
will
reply
that
there
can
be
no
comparison
,
that
the
dead
*NL*
can
not
be
numbered
,
while
the
living
who
have
been
rewarded
may
be
summed
*NL*
up
with
three
figures
.
All
which
is
the
reverse
in
the
case
of
men
of
*NL*
letters
;
for
by
skirts
,
to
say
nothing
of
sleeves
,
they
all
find
means
of
*NL*
support
;
so
that
though
the
soldier
has
more
to
endure
,
his
reward
is
*NL*
much
less
.
But
against
all
this
it
may
be
urged
that
it
is
easier
to
*NL*
reward
two
thousand
soldiers
,
for
the
former
may
be
remunerated
by
giving
*NL*
them
places
,
which
must
perforce
be
conferred
upon
men
of
their
calling
,
*NL*
while
the
latter
can
only
be
recompensed
out
of
the
very
property
of
the
*NL*
master
they
serve
;
but
this
impossibility
only
strengthens
my
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Putting
this
,
however
,
aside
,
for
it
is
a
puzzling
question
for
which
it
*NL*
is
difficult
to
find
a
solution
,
let
us
return
to
the
superiority
of
arms
*NL*
over
letters
,
a
matter
still
undecided
,
so
many
are
the
arguments
put
*NL*
forward
on
each
side
;
for
besides
those
I
have
mentioned
,
letters
say
*NL*
that
without
them
arms
can
not
maintain
themselves
,
for
war
,
too
,
has
its
*NL*
laws
and
is
governed
by
them
,
and
laws
belong
to
the
domain
of
letters
*NL*
and
men
of
letters
.
To
this
arms
make
answer
that
without
them
laws
*NL*
can
not
be
maintained
,
for
by
arms
states
are
defended
,
kingdoms
*NL*
preserved
,
cities
protected
,
roads
made
safe
,
seas
cleared
of
pirates
;
*NL*
and
,
in
short
,
if
it
were
not
for
them
,
states
,
kingdoms
,
monarchies
,
*NL*
cities
,
ways
by
sea
and
land
would
be
exposed
to
the
violence
and
*NL*
confusion
which
war
brings
with
it
,
so
long
as
it
lasts
and
is
free
to
*NL*
make
use
of
its
privileges
and
powers
.
And
then
it
is
plain
that
whatever
*NL*
costs
most
is
valued
and
deserves
to
be
valued
most
.
To
attain
to
*NL*
eminence
in
letters
costs
a
man
time
,
watching
,
hunger
,
nakedness
,
*NL*
headaches
,
indigestions
,
and
other
things
of
the
sort
,
some
of
which
I
*NL*
have
already
referred
to
.
But
for
a
man
to
come
in
the
ordinary
course
of
*NL*
things
to
be
a
good
soldier
costs
him
all
the
student
suffers
,
and
in
an
*NL*
incomparably
higher
degree
,
for
at
every
step
he
runs
the
risk
of
losing
*NL*
his
life
.
For
what
dread
of
want
or
poverty
that
can
reach
or
harass
the
*NL*
student
can
compare
with
what
the
soldier
feels
,
who
finds
himself
*NL*
beleaguered
in
some
stronghold
mounting
guard
in
some
ravelin
or
*NL*
cavalier
,
knows
that
the
enemy
is
pushing
a
mine
towards
the
post
where
*NL*
he
is
stationed
,
and
can
not
under
any
circumstances
retire
or
fly
from
*NL*
the
imminent
danger
that
threatens
him
?
All
he
can
do
is
to
inform
his
*NL*
captain
of
what
is
going
on
so
that
he
may
try
to
remedy
it
by
a
*NL*
counter-mine
,
and
then
stand
his
ground
in
fear
and
expectation
of
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
will
fly
up
to
the
clouds
without
wings
and
descend
into
*NL*
the
deep
against
his
will
.
And
if
this
seems
a
trifling
risk
,
let
us
see
*NL*
whether
it
is
equalled
or
surpassed
by
the
encounter
of
two
galleys
stem
*NL*
to
stem
,
in
the
midst
of
the
open
sea
,
locked
and
entangled
one
with
the
*NL*
other
,
when
the
soldier
has
no
more
standing
room
than
two
feet
of
the
*NL*
plank
of
the
spur
;
and
yet
,
though
he
sees
before
him
threatening
him
as
*NL*
many
ministers
of
death
as
there
are
cannon
of
the
foe
pointed
at
him
,
*NL*
not
a
lance
length
from
his
body
,
and
sees
too
that
with
the
first
*NL*
heedless
step
he
will
go
down
to
visit
the
profundities
of
Neptune
's
*NL*
bosom
,
still
with
dauntless
heart
,
urged
on
by
honour
that
nerves
him
,
he
*NL*
makes
himself
a
target
for
all
that
musketry
,
and
struggles
to
cross
that
*NL*
narrow
path
to
the
enemy
's
ship
.
And
what
is
still
more
marvellous
,
no
*NL*
sooner
has
one
gone
down
into
the
depths
he
will
never
rise
from
till
the
*NL*
end
of
the
world
,
than
another
takes
his
place
;
and
if
he
too
falls
into
*NL*
the
sea
that
waits
for
him
like
an
enemy
,
another
and
another
will
*NL*
succeed
him
without
a
moment
's
pause
between
their
deaths
:
courage
and
*NL*
daring
the
greatest
that
all
the
chances
of
war
can
show
.
Happy
the
blest
*NL*
ages
that
knew
not
the
dread
fury
of
those
devilish
engines
of
artillery
,
*NL*
whose
inventor
I
am
persuaded
is
in
hell
receiving
the
reward
of
his
*NL*
diabolical
invention
,
by
which
he
made
it
easy
for
a
base
and
cowardly
*NL*
arm
to
take
the
life
of
a
gallant
gentleman
;
and
that
,
when
he
knows
not
*NL*
how
or
whence
,
in
the
height
of
the
ardour
and
enthusiasm
that
fire
and
*NL*
animate
brave
hearts
,
there
should
come
some
random
bullet
,
discharged
*NL*
perhaps
by
one
who
fled
in
terror
at
the
flash
when
he
fired
off
his
*NL*
accursed
machine
,
which
in
an
instant
puts
an
end
to
the
projects
and
*NL*
cuts
off
the
life
of
one
who
deserved
to
live
for
ages
to
come
.
And
thus
*NL*
when
I
reflect
on
this
,
I
am
almost
tempted
to
say
that
in
my
heart
I
*NL*
repent
of
having
adopted
this
profession
of
knight-errant
in
so
*NL*
detestable
an
age
as
we
live
in
now
;
for
though
no
peril
can
make
me
*NL*
fear
,
still
it
gives
me
some
uneasiness
to
think
that
powder
and
lead
may
*NL*
rob
me
of
the
opportunity
of
making
myself
famous
and
renowned
throughout
*NL*
the
known
earth
by
the
might
of
my
arm
and
the
edge
of
my
sword
.
But
*NL*
Heaven
's
will
be
done
;
if
I
succeed
in
my
attempt
I
shall
be
all
the
more
*NL*
honoured
,
as
I
have
faced
greater
dangers
than
the
knights-errant
of
yore
*NL*
exposed
themselves
to
.

*NL*

All
this
lengthy
discourse
Don
Quixote
delivered
while
the
others
supped
,
*NL*
forgetting
to
raise
a
morsel
to
his
lips
,
though
Sancho
more
than
once
*NL*
told
him
to
eat
his
supper
,
as
he
would
have
time
enough
afterwards
to
*NL*
say
all
he
wanted
.
It
excited
fresh
pity
in
those
who
had
heard
him
to
*NL*
see
a
man
of
apparently
sound
sense
,
and
with
rational
views
on
every
*NL*
subject
he
discussed
,
so
hopelessly
wanting
in
all
,
when
his
wretched
*NL*
unlucky
chivalry
was
in
question
.
The
curate
told
him
he
was
quite
right
*NL*
in
all
he
had
said
in
favour
of
arms
,
and
that
he
himself
,
though
a
man
*NL*
of
letters
and
a
graduate
,
was
of
the
same
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
finished
their
supper
,
the
cloth
was
removed
,
and
while
the
hostess
,
*NL*
her
daughter
,
and
Maritornes
were
getting
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
's
*NL*
garret
ready
,
in
which
it
was
arranged
that
the
women
were
to
be
*NL*
quartered
by
themselves
for
the
night
,
Don
Fernando
begged
the
captive
to
*NL*
tell
them
the
story
of
his
life
,
for
it
could
not
fail
to
be
strange
and
*NL*
interesting
,
to
judge
by
the
hints
he
had
let
fall
on
his
arrival
in
*NL*
company
with
Zoraida
.
To
this
the
captive
replied
that
he
would
very
*NL*
willingly
yield
to
his
request
,
only
he
feared
his
tale
would
not
give
*NL*
them
as
much
pleasure
as
he
wished
;
nevertheless
,
not
to
be
wanting
in
*NL*
compliance
,
he
would
tell
it
.
The
curate
and
the
others
thanked
him
and
*NL*
added
their
entreaties
,
and
he
finding
himself
so
pressed
said
there
was
*NL*
no
occasion
ask
,
where
a
command
had
such
weight
,
and
added
,
``
If
your
*NL*
worships
will
give
me
your
attention
you
will
hear
a
true
story
which
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
fictitious
ones
constructed
with
ingenious
and
studied
art
*NL*
can
not
come
up
to
.
''
These
words
made
them
settle
themselves
in
their
*NL*
places
and
preserve
a
deep
silence
,
and
he
seeing
them
waiting
on
his
*NL*
words
in
mute
expectation
,
began
thus
in
a
pleasant
quiet
voice
.

CHAPTER
XXXIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
THE
CAPTIVE
RELATES
HIS
LIFE
AND
ADVENTURES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
family
had
its
origin
in
a
village
in
the
mountains
of
Leon
,
and
*NL*
nature
had
been
kinder
and
more
generous
to
it
than
fortune
;
though
in
*NL*
the
general
poverty
of
those
communities
my
father
passed
for
being
even
*NL*
a
rich
man
;
and
he
would
have
been
so
in
reality
had
he
been
as
clever
in
*NL*
preserving
his
property
as
he
was
in
spending
it
.
This
tendency
of
his
to
*NL*
be
liberal
and
profuse
he
had
acquired
from
having
been
a
soldier
in
his
*NL*
youth
,
for
the
soldier
's
life
is
a
school
in
which
the
niggard
becomes
*NL*
free-handed
and
the
free-handed
prodigal
;
and
if
any
soldiers
are
to
be
*NL*
found
who
are
misers
,
they
are
monsters
of
rare
occurrence
.
My
father
*NL*
went
beyond
liberality
and
bordered
on
prodigality
,
a
disposition
by
no
*NL*
means
advantageous
to
a
married
man
who
has
children
to
succeed
to
his
*NL*
name
and
position
.
My
father
had
three
,
all
sons
,
and
all
of
sufficient
*NL*
age
to
make
choice
of
a
profession
.
Finding
,
then
,
that
he
was
unable
to
*NL*
resist
his
propensity
,
he
resolved
to
divest
himself
of
the
instrument
*NL*
and
cause
of
his
prodigality
and
lavishness
,
to
divest
himself
of
wealth
,
*NL*
without
which
Alexander
himself
would
have
seemed
parsimonious
;
and
so
*NL*
calling
us
all
three
aside
one
day
into
a
room
,
he
addressed
us
in
words
*NL*
somewhat
to
the
following
effect
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sons
,
to
assure
you
that
I
love
you
,
no
more
need
be
known
or
said
*NL*
than
that
you
are
my
sons
;
and
to
encourage
a
suspicion
that
I
do
not
*NL*
love
you
,
no
more
is
needed
than
the
knowledge
that
I
have
no
*NL*
self-control
as
far
as
preservation
of
your
patrimony
is
concerned
;
*NL*
therefore
,
that
you
may
for
the
future
feel
sure
that
I
love
you
like
a
*NL*
father
,
and
have
no
wish
to
ruin
you
like
a
stepfather
,
I
propose
to
do
*NL*
with
you
what
I
have
for
some
time
back
meditated
,
and
after
mature
*NL*
deliberation
decided
upon
.
You
are
now
of
an
age
to
choose
your
line
of
*NL*
life
or
at
least
make
choice
of
a
calling
that
will
bring
you
honour
and
*NL*
profit
when
you
are
older
;
and
what
I
have
resolved
to
do
is
to
divide
my
*NL*
property
into
four
parts
;
three
I
will
give
to
you
,
to
each
his
portion
*NL*
without
making
any
difference
,
and
the
other
I
will
retain
to
live
upon
*NL*
and
support
myself
for
whatever
remainder
of
life
Heaven
may
be
pleased
*NL*
to
grant
me
.
But
I
wish
each
of
you
on
taking
possession
of
the
share
*NL*
that
falls
to
him
to
follow
one
of
the
paths
I
shall
indicate
.
In
this
*NL*
Spain
of
ours
there
is
a
proverb
,
to
my
mind
very
true
--
as
they
all
are
,
*NL*
being
short
aphorisms
drawn
from
long
practical
experience
--
and
the
one
I
*NL*
refer
to
says
,
`
The
church
,
or
the
sea
,
or
the
king
's
house
;
'
as
much
as
*NL*
to
say
,
in
plainer
language
,
whoever
wants
to
flourish
and
become
rich
,
*NL*
let
him
follow
the
church
,
or
go
to
sea
,
adopting
commerce
as
his
*NL*
calling
,
or
go
into
the
king
's
service
in
his
household
,
for
they
say
,
*NL*
`
Better
a
king
's
crumb
than
a
lord
's
favour
.
'
I
say
so
because
it
is
my
*NL*
will
and
pleasure
that
one
of
you
should
follow
letters
,
another
trade
,
*NL*
and
the
third
serve
the
king
in
the
wars
,
for
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
*NL*
gain
admission
to
his
service
in
his
household
,
and
if
war
does
not
bring
*NL*
much
wealth
it
confers
great
distinction
and
fame
.
Eight
days
hence
I
*NL*
will
give
you
your
full
shares
in
money
,
without
defrauding
you
of
a
*NL*
farthing
,
as
you
will
see
in
the
end
.
Now
tell
me
if
you
are
willing
to
*NL*
follow
out
my
idea
and
advice
as
I
have
laid
it
before
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
called
upon
me
as
the
eldest
to
answer
,
I
,
after
urging
him
not
to
*NL*
strip
himself
of
his
property
but
to
spend
it
all
as
he
pleased
,
for
we
*NL*
were
young
men
able
to
gain
our
living
,
consented
to
comply
with
his
*NL*
wishes
,
and
said
that
mine
were
to
follow
the
profession
of
arms
and
*NL*
thereby
serve
God
and
my
king
.
My
second
brother
having
made
the
same
*NL*
proposal
,
decided
upon
going
to
the
Indies
,
embarking
the
portion
that
*NL*
fell
to
him
in
trade
.
The
youngest
,
and
in
my
opinion
the
wisest
,
said
he
*NL*
would
rather
follow
the
church
,
or
go
to
complete
his
studies
at
*NL*
Salamanca
.
As
soon
as
we
had
come
to
an
understanding
,
and
made
choice
of
*NL*
our
professions
,
my
father
embraced
us
all
,
and
in
the
short
time
he
*NL*
mentioned
carried
into
effect
all
he
had
promised
;
and
when
he
had
given
*NL*
to
each
his
share
,
which
as
well
as
I
remember
was
three
thousand
ducats
*NL*
apiece
in
cash
-LRB-
for
an
uncle
of
ours
bought
the
estate
and
paid
for
it
*NL*
down
,
not
to
let
it
go
out
of
the
family
-RRB-
,
we
all
three
on
the
same
day
*NL*
took
leave
of
our
good
father
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
*NL*
inhuman
to
leave
my
father
with
such
scanty
means
in
his
old
age
,
I
*NL*
induced
him
to
take
two
of
my
three
thousand
ducats
,
as
the
remainder
*NL*
would
be
enough
to
provide
me
with
all
a
soldier
needed
.
My
two
brothers
,
*NL*
moved
by
my
example
,
gave
him
each
a
thousand
ducats
,
so
that
there
was
*NL*
left
for
my
father
four
thousand
ducats
in
money
,
besides
three
thousand
,
*NL*
the
value
of
the
portion
that
fell
to
him
which
he
preferred
to
retain
in
*NL*
land
instead
of
selling
it
.
Finally
,
as
I
said
,
we
took
leave
of
him
,
and
*NL*
of
our
uncle
whom
I
have
mentioned
,
not
without
sorrow
and
tears
on
both
*NL*
sides
,
they
charging
us
to
let
them
know
whenever
an
opportunity
offered
*NL*
how
we
fared
,
whether
well
or
ill
.
We
promised
to
do
so
,
and
when
he
had
*NL*
embraced
us
and
given
us
his
blessing
,
one
set
out
for
Salamanca
,
the
*NL*
other
for
Seville
,
and
I
for
Alicante
,
where
I
had
heard
there
was
a
*NL*
Genoese
vessel
taking
in
a
cargo
of
wool
for
Genoa
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
now
some
twenty-two
years
since
I
left
my
father
's
house
,
and
all
*NL*
that
time
,
though
I
have
written
several
letters
,
I
have
had
no
news
*NL*
whatever
of
him
or
of
my
brothers
;
my
own
adventures
during
that
period
I
*NL*
will
now
relate
briefly
.
I
embarked
at
Alicante
,
reached
Genoa
after
a
*NL*
prosperous
voyage
,
and
proceeded
thence
to
Milan
,
where
I
provided
myself
*NL*
with
arms
and
a
few
soldier
's
accoutrements
;
thence
it
was
my
intention
*NL*
to
go
and
take
service
in
Piedmont
,
but
as
I
was
already
on
the
road
to
*NL*
Alessandria
della
Paglia
,
I
learned
that
the
great
Duke
of
Alva
was
on
*NL*
his
way
to
Flanders
.
I
changed
my
plans
,
joined
him
,
served
under
him
in
*NL*
the
campaigns
he
made
,
was
present
at
the
deaths
of
the
Counts
Egmont
and
*NL*
Horn
,
and
was
promoted
to
be
ensign
under
a
famous
captain
of
*NL*
Guadalajara
,
Diego
de
Urbina
by
name
.
Some
time
after
my
arrival
in
*NL*
Flanders
news
came
of
the
league
that
his
Holiness
Pope
Pius
V
of
happy
*NL*
memory
,
had
made
with
Venice
and
Spain
against
the
common
enemy
,
the
*NL*
Turk
,
who
had
just
then
with
his
fleet
taken
the
famous
island
of
Cyprus
,
*NL*
which
belonged
to
the
Venetians
,
a
loss
deplorable
and
disastrous
.
It
was
*NL*
known
as
a
fact
that
the
Most
Serene
Don
John
of
Austria
,
natural
brother
*NL*
of
our
good
king
Don
Philip
,
was
coming
as
commander-in-chief
of
the
*NL*
allied
forces
,
and
rumours
were
abroad
of
the
vast
warlike
preparations
*NL*
which
were
being
made
,
all
which
stirred
my
heart
and
filled
me
with
a
*NL*
longing
to
take
part
in
the
campaign
which
was
expected
;
and
though
I
had
*NL*
reason
to
believe
,
and
almost
certain
promises
,
that
on
the
first
*NL*
opportunity
that
presented
itself
I
should
be
promoted
to
be
captain
,
I
*NL*
preferred
to
leave
all
and
betake
myself
,
as
I
did
,
to
Italy
;
and
it
was
*NL*
my
good
fortune
that
Don
John
had
just
arrived
at
Genoa
,
and
was
going
on
*NL*
to
Naples
to
join
the
Venetian
fleet
,
as
he
afterwards
did
at
Messina
.
I
*NL*
may
say
,
in
short
,
that
I
took
part
in
that
glorious
expedition
,
promoted
*NL*
by
this
time
to
be
a
captain
of
infantry
,
to
which
honourable
charge
my
*NL*
good
luck
rather
than
my
merits
raised
me
;
and
that
day
--
so
fortunate
for
*NL*
Christendom
,
because
then
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
were
disabused
of
*NL*
the
error
under
which
they
lay
in
imagining
the
Turks
to
be
invincible
on
*NL*
sea-on
that
day
,
I
say
,
on
which
the
Ottoman
pride
and
arrogance
were
*NL*
broken
,
among
all
that
were
there
made
happy
-LRB-
for
the
Christians
who
died
*NL*
that
day
were
happier
than
those
who
remained
alive
and
victorious
-RRB-
I
*NL*
alone
was
miserable
;
for
,
instead
of
some
naval
crown
that
I
might
have
*NL*
expected
had
it
been
in
Roman
times
,
on
the
night
that
followed
that
*NL*
famous
day
I
found
myself
with
fetters
on
my
feet
and
manacles
on
my
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
in
this
way
:
El
Uchali
,
the
king
of
Algiers
,
a
daring
and
*NL*
successful
corsair
,
having
attacked
and
taken
the
leading
Maltese
galley
*NL*
-LRB-
only
three
knights
being
left
alive
in
it
,
and
they
badly
wounded
-RRB-
,
the
*NL*
chief
galley
of
John
Andrea
,
on
board
of
which
I
and
my
company
were
*NL*
placed
,
came
to
its
relief
,
and
doing
as
was
bound
to
do
in
such
a
case
,
*NL*
I
leaped
on
board
the
enemy
's
galley
,
which
,
sheering
off
from
that
which
*NL*
had
attacked
it
,
prevented
my
men
from
following
me
,
and
so
I
found
*NL*
myself
alone
in
the
midst
of
my
enemies
,
who
were
in
such
numbers
that
I
*NL*
was
unable
to
resist
;
in
short
I
was
taken
,
covered
with
wounds
;
El
*NL*
Uchali
,
as
you
know
,
sirs
,
made
his
escape
with
his
entire
squadron
,
and
*NL*
I
was
left
a
prisoner
in
his
power
,
the
only
sad
being
among
so
many
*NL*
filled
with
joy
,
and
the
only
captive
among
so
many
free
;
for
there
were
*NL*
fifteen
thousand
Christians
,
all
at
the
oar
in
the
Turkish
fleet
,
that
*NL*
regained
their
longed-for
liberty
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
carried
me
to
Constantinople
,
where
the
Grand
Turk
,
Selim
,
made
my
*NL*
master
general
at
sea
for
having
done
his
duty
in
the
battle
and
carried
*NL*
off
as
evidence
of
his
bravery
the
standard
of
the
Order
of
Malta
.
The
*NL*
following
year
,
which
was
the
year
seventy-two
,
I
found
myself
at
*NL*
Navarino
rowing
in
the
leading
galley
with
the
three
lanterns
.
There
I
*NL*
saw
and
observed
how
the
opportunity
of
capturing
the
whole
Turkish
fleet
*NL*
in
harbour
was
lost
;
for
all
the
marines
and
janizzaries
that
belonged
to
*NL*
it
made
sure
that
they
were
about
to
be
attacked
inside
the
very
harbour
,
*NL*
and
had
their
kits
and
pasamaques
,
or
shoes
,
ready
to
flee
at
once
on
*NL*
shore
without
waiting
to
be
assailed
,
in
so
great
fear
did
they
stand
of
*NL*
our
fleet
.
But
Heaven
ordered
it
otherwise
,
not
for
any
fault
or
neglect
*NL*
of
the
general
who
commanded
on
our
side
,
but
for
the
sins
of
*NL*
Christendom
,
and
because
it
was
God
's
will
and
pleasure
that
we
should
*NL*
always
have
instruments
of
punishment
to
chastise
us
.
As
it
was
,
El
*NL*
Uchali
took
refuge
at
Modon
,
which
is
an
island
near
Navarino
,
and
*NL*
landing
forces
fortified
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
and
waited
quietly
*NL*
until
Don
John
retired
.
On
this
expedition
was
taken
the
galley
called
*NL*
the
Prize
,
whose
captain
was
a
son
of
the
famous
corsair
Barbarossa
.
It
*NL*
was
taken
by
the
chief
Neapolitan
galley
called
the
She-wolf
,
commanded
*NL*
by
that
thunderbolt
of
war
,
that
father
of
his
men
,
that
successful
and
*NL*
unconquered
captain
Don
Alvaro
de
Bazan
,
Marquis
of
Santa
Cruz
;
and
I
*NL*
can
not
help
telling
you
what
took
place
at
the
capture
of
the
Prize
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
son
of
Barbarossa
was
so
cruel
,
and
treated
his
slaves
so
badly
,
*NL*
that
,
when
those
who
were
at
the
oars
saw
that
the
She-wolf
galley
was
*NL*
bearing
down
upon
them
and
gaining
upon
them
,
they
all
at
once
dropped
*NL*
their
oars
and
seized
their
captain
who
stood
on
the
stage
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
gangway
shouting
to
them
to
row
lustily
;
and
passing
him
on
from
*NL*
bench
to
bench
,
from
the
poop
to
the
prow
,
they
so
bit
him
that
before
he
*NL*
had
got
much
past
the
mast
his
soul
had
already
got
to
hell
;
so
great
,
as
*NL*
I
said
,
was
the
cruelty
with
which
he
treated
them
,
and
the
hatred
with
*NL*
which
they
hated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
returned
to
Constantinople
,
and
the
following
year
,
seventy-three
,
it
*NL*
became
known
that
Don
John
had
seized
Tunis
and
taken
the
kingdom
from
*NL*
the
Turks
,
and
placed
Muley
Hamet
in
possession
,
putting
an
end
to
the
*NL*
hopes
which
Muley
Hamida
,
the
cruelest
and
bravest
Moor
in
the
world
,
*NL*
entertained
of
returning
to
reign
there
.
The
Grand
Turk
took
the
loss
*NL*
greatly
to
heart
,
and
with
the
cunning
which
all
his
race
possess
,
he
*NL*
made
peace
with
the
Venetians
-LRB-
who
were
much
more
eager
for
it
than
he
*NL*
was
-RRB-
,
and
the
following
year
,
seventy-four
,
he
attacked
the
Goletta
and
*NL*
the
fort
which
Don
John
had
left
half
built
near
Tunis
.
While
all
these
*NL*
events
were
occurring
,
I
was
labouring
at
the
oar
without
any
hope
of
*NL*
freedom
;
at
least
I
had
no
hope
of
obtaining
it
by
ransom
,
for
I
was
*NL*
firmly
resolved
not
to
write
to
my
father
telling
him
of
my
misfortunes
.
*NL*
At
length
the
Goletta
fell
,
and
the
fort
fell
,
before
which
places
there
*NL*
were
seventy-five
thousand
regular
Turkish
soldiers
,
and
more
than
four
*NL*
hundred
thousand
Moors
and
Arabs
from
all
parts
of
Africa
,
and
in
the
*NL*
train
of
all
this
great
host
such
munitions
and
engines
of
war
,
and
so
*NL*
many
pioneers
that
with
their
hands
they
might
have
covered
the
Goletta
*NL*
and
the
fort
with
handfuls
of
earth
.
The
first
to
fall
was
the
Goletta
,
*NL*
until
then
reckoned
impregnable
,
and
it
fell
,
not
by
any
fault
of
its
*NL*
defenders
,
who
did
all
that
they
could
and
should
have
done
,
but
because
*NL*
experiment
proved
how
easily
entrenchments
could
be
made
in
the
desert
*NL*
sand
there
;
for
water
used
to
be
found
at
two
palms
depth
,
while
the
*NL*
Turks
found
none
at
two
yards
;
and
so
by
means
of
a
quantity
of
sandbags
*NL*
they
raised
their
works
so
high
that
they
commanded
the
walls
of
the
*NL*
fort
,
sweeping
them
as
if
from
a
cavalier
,
so
that
no
one
was
able
to
*NL*
make
a
stand
or
maintain
the
defence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
common
opinion
that
our
men
should
not
have
shut
themselves
up
*NL*
in
the
Goletta
,
but
should
have
waited
in
the
open
at
the
landing-place
;
*NL*
but
those
who
say
so
talk
at
random
and
with
little
knowledge
of
such
*NL*
matters
;
for
if
in
the
Goletta
and
in
the
fort
there
were
barely
seven
*NL*
thousand
soldiers
,
how
could
such
a
small
number
,
however
resolute
,
sally
*NL*
out
and
hold
their
own
against
numbers
like
those
of
the
enemy
?
And
how
*NL*
is
it
possible
to
help
losing
a
stronghold
that
is
not
relieved
,
above
*NL*
all
when
surrounded
by
a
host
of
determined
enemies
in
their
own
country
?
*NL*
But
many
thought
,
and
I
thought
so
too
,
that
it
was
special
favour
and
*NL*
mercy
which
Heaven
showed
to
Spain
in
permitting
the
destruction
of
that
*NL*
source
and
hiding
place
of
mischief
,
that
devourer
,
sponge
,
and
moth
of
*NL*
countless
money
,
fruitlessly
wasted
there
to
no
other
purpose
save
*NL*
preserving
the
memory
of
its
capture
by
the
invincible
Charles
V
;
as
if
*NL*
to
make
that
eternal
,
as
it
is
and
will
be
,
these
stones
were
needed
to
*NL*
support
it
.
The
fort
also
fell
;
but
the
Turks
had
to
win
it
inch
by
inch
,
*NL*
for
the
soldiers
who
defended
it
fought
so
gallantly
and
stoutly
that
the
*NL*
number
of
the
enemy
killed
in
twenty-two
general
assaults
exceeded
*NL*
twenty-five
thousand
.
Of
three
hundred
that
remained
alive
not
one
was
*NL*
taken
unwounded
,
a
clear
and
manifest
proof
of
their
gallantry
and
*NL*
resolution
,
and
how
sturdily
they
had
defended
themselves
and
held
their
*NL*
post
.
A
small
fort
or
tower
which
was
in
the
middle
of
the
lagoon
under
*NL*
the
command
of
Don
Juan
Zanoguera
,
a
Valencian
gentleman
and
a
famous
*NL*
soldier
,
capitulated
upon
terms
.
They
took
prisoner
Don
Pedro
*NL*
Puertocarrero
,
commandant
of
the
Goletta
,
who
had
done
all
in
his
power
*NL*
to
defend
his
fortress
,
and
took
the
loss
of
it
so
much
to
heart
that
he
*NL*
died
of
grief
on
the
way
to
Constantinople
,
where
they
were
carrying
him
*NL*
a
prisoner
.
They
also
took
the
commandant
of
the
fort
,
Gabrio
Cerbellon
*NL*
by
name
,
a
Milanese
gentleman
,
a
great
engineer
and
a
very
brave
soldier
.
*NL*
In
these
two
fortresses
perished
many
persons
of
note
,
among
whom
was
*NL*
Pagano
Doria
,
knight
of
the
Order
of
St.
John
,
a
man
of
generous
*NL*
disposition
,
as
was
shown
by
his
extreme
liberality
to
his
brother
,
the
*NL*
famous
John
Andrea
Doria
;
and
what
made
his
death
the
more
sad
was
that
*NL*
he
was
slain
by
some
Arabs
to
whom
,
seeing
that
the
fort
was
now
lost
,
he
*NL*
entrusted
himself
,
and
who
offered
to
conduct
him
in
the
disguise
of
a
*NL*
Moor
to
Tabarca
,
a
small
fort
or
station
on
the
coast
held
by
the
Genoese
*NL*
employed
in
the
coral
fishery
.
These
Arabs
cut
off
his
head
and
carried
*NL*
it
to
the
commander
of
the
Turkish
fleet
,
who
proved
on
them
the
truth
of
*NL*
our
Castilian
proverb
,
that
``
though
the
treason
may
please
,
the
traitor
*NL*
is
hated
;
''
for
they
say
he
ordered
those
who
brought
him
the
present
to
*NL*
be
hanged
for
not
having
brought
him
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
Christians
who
were
taken
in
the
fort
was
one
named
Don
Pedro
*NL*
de
Aguilar
,
a
native
of
some
place
,
I
know
not
what
,
in
Andalusia
,
who
*NL*
had
been
ensign
in
the
fort
,
a
soldier
of
great
repute
and
rare
*NL*
intelligence
,
who
had
in
particular
a
special
gift
for
what
they
call
*NL*
poetry
.
I
say
so
because
his
fate
brought
him
to
my
galley
and
to
my
*NL*
bench
,
and
made
him
a
slave
to
the
same
master
;
and
before
we
left
the
*NL*
port
this
gentleman
composed
two
sonnets
by
way
of
epitaphs
,
one
on
the
*NL*
Goletta
and
the
other
on
the
fort
;
indeed
,
I
may
as
well
repeat
them
,
for
*NL*
I
have
them
by
heart
,
and
I
think
they
will
be
liked
rather
than
*NL*
disliked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
the
captive
mentioned
the
name
of
Don
Pedro
de
Aguilar
,
Don
*NL*
Fernando
looked
at
his
companions
and
they
all
three
smiled
;
and
when
he
*NL*
came
to
speak
of
the
sonnets
one
of
them
said
,
``
Before
your
worship
*NL*
proceeds
any
further
I
entreat
you
to
tell
me
what
became
of
that
Don
*NL*
Pedro
de
Aguilar
you
have
spoken
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
know
is
,
''
replied
the
captive
,
``
that
after
having
been
in
*NL*
Constantinople
two
years
,
he
escaped
in
the
disguise
of
an
Arnaut
,
in
*NL*
company
with
a
Greek
spy
;
but
whether
he
regained
his
liberty
or
not
I
*NL*
can
not
tell
,
though
I
fancy
he
did
,
because
a
year
afterwards
I
saw
the
*NL*
Greek
at
Constantinople
,
though
I
was
unable
to
ask
him
what
the
result
*NL*
of
the
journey
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
you
are
right
,
''
returned
the
gentleman
,
``
for
that
Don
Pedro
*NL*
is
my
brother
,
and
he
is
now
in
our
village
in
good
health
,
rich
,
*NL*
married
,
and
with
three
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
be
to
God
for
all
the
mercies
he
has
shown
him
,
''
said
the
*NL*
captive
;
``
for
to
my
mind
there
is
no
happiness
on
earth
to
compare
with
*NL*
recovering
lost
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
more
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
``
I
know
the
sonnets
my
brother
*NL*
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
your
worship
repeat
them
,
''
said
the
captive
,
``
for
you
will
*NL*
recite
them
better
than
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart

said
the
gentleman
;
``
that
on
the
Goletta
runs
thus

Up
from
this

this
shattered

Whose

here
in
ruin
lie
,
*NL*
Three
thousand

Wearied

few
the

fell

And
this

ever

*NL*
*NL*
The
sonnets
were
not
disliked
,
and
the
captive
was
rejoiced
at
the
*NL*
tidings
they
gave
him
of
his
comrade
,
and
continuing
his
tale
,
he
went
on
*NL*
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
Goletta
and
the
fort
being
thus
in
their
hands
,
the
Turks
gave
orders
*NL*
to
dismantle
the
Goletta
--
for
the
fort
was
reduced
to
such
a
state
that
*NL*
there
was
nothing
left
to
level
--
and
to
do
the
work
more
quickly
and
*NL*
easily
they
mined
it
in
three
places
;
but
nowhere
were
they
able
to
blow
*NL*
up
the
part
which
seemed
to
be
the
least
strong
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
old
*NL*
walls
,
while
all
that
remained
standing
of
the
new
fortifications
that
*NL*
the
Fratin
had
made
came
to
the
ground
with
the
greatest
ease
.
Finally
*NL*
the
fleet
returned
victorious
and
triumphant
to
Constantinople
,
and
a
few
*NL*
months
later
died
my
master
,
El
Uchali
,
otherwise
Uchali
Fartax
,
which
*NL*
means
in
Turkish
``
the
scabby
renegade
;
''
for
that
he
was
;
it
is
the
*NL*
practice
with
the
Turks
to
name
people
from
some
defect
or
virtue
they
*NL*
may
possess
;
the
reason
being
that
there
are
among
them
only
four
*NL*
surnames
belonging
to
families
tracing
their
descent
from
the
Ottoman
*NL*
house
,
and
the
others
,
as
I
have
said
,
take
their
names
and
surnames
*NL*
either
from
bodily
blemishes
or
moral
qualities

rowed
*NL*
at
the
oar
as
a
slave
of
the
Grand
Signor
's
for
fourteen
years
,
and
when
*NL*
over
thirty-four
years
of
age
,
in
resentment
at
having
been
struck
by
a
*NL*
Turk
while
at
the
oar
,
turned
renegade
and
renounced
his
faith
in
order
*NL*
to
be
able
to
revenge
himself
;
and
such
was
his
valour
that
,
without
*NL*
owing
his
advancement
to
the
base
ways
and
means
by
which
most
favourites
*NL*
of
the
Grand
Signor
rise
to
power
,
he
came
to
be
king
of
Algiers
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
general-on-sea
,
which
is
the
third
place
of
trust
in
the
*NL*
realm
.
He
was
a
Calabrian
by
birth
,
and
a
worthy
man
morally
,
and
he
*NL*
treated
his
slaves
with
great
humanity
.
He
had
three
thousand
of
them
,
*NL*
and
after
his
death
they
were
divided
,
as
he
directed
by
his
will
,
*NL*
between
the
Grand
Signor
-LRB-
who
is
heir
of
all
who
die
and
shares
with
the
*NL*
children
of
the
deceased
-RRB-
and
his
renegades
.
I
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
*NL*
Venetian
renegade
who
,
when
a
cabin
boy
on
board
a
ship
,
had
been
taken
*NL*
by
Uchali
and
was
so
much
beloved
by
him
that
he
became
one
of
his
most
*NL*
favoured
youths
.
He
came
to
be
the
most
cruel
renegade
I
ever
saw
:
his
*NL*
name
was
Hassan
Aga
,
and
he
grew
very
rich
and
became
king
of
Algiers
.
*NL*
With
him
I
went
there
from
Constantinople
,
rather
glad
to
be
so
near
*NL*
Spain
,
not
that
I
intended
to
write
to
anyone
about
my
unhappy
lot
,
but
*NL*
to
try
if
fortune
would
be
kinder
to
me
in
Algiers
than
in
*NL*
Constantinople
,
where
I
had
attempted
in
a
thousand
ways
to
escape
*NL*
without
ever
finding
a
favourable
time
or
chance
;
but
in
Algiers
I
*NL*
resolved
to
seek
for
other
means
of
effecting
the
purpose
I
cherished
so
*NL*
dearly
;
for
the
hope
of
obtaining
my
liberty
never
deserted
me
;
and
when
*NL*
in
my
plots
and
schemes
and
attempts
the
result
did
not
answer
my
*NL*
expectations
,
without
giving
way
to
despair
I
immediately
began
to
look
*NL*
out
for
or
conjure
up
some
new
hope
to
support
me
,
however
faint
or
*NL*
feeble
it
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
I
lived
on
immured
in
a
building
or
prison
called
by
the
*NL*
Turks
a
bano
in
which
they
confine
the
Christian
captives
,
as
well
those
*NL*
that
are
the
king
's
as
those
belonging
to
private
individuals
,
and
also
*NL*
what
they
call
those
of
the
Almacen
,
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
the
*NL*
slaves
of
the
municipality
,
who
serve
the
city
in
the
public
works
and
*NL*
other
employments
;
but
captives
of
this
kind
recover
their
liberty
with
*NL*
great
difficulty
,
for
,
as
they
are
public
property
and
have
no
particular
*NL*
master
,
there
is
no
one
with
whom
to
treat
for
their
ransom
,
even
though
*NL*
they
may
have
the
means
.
To
these
banos
,
as
I
have
said
,
some
private
*NL*
individuals
of
the
town
are
in
the
habit
of
bringing
their
captives
,
*NL*
especially
when
they
are
to
be
ransomed
;
because
there
they
can
keep
them
*NL*
in
safety
and
comfort
until
their
ransom
arrives
.
The
king
's
captives
*NL*
also
,
that
are
on
ransom
,
do
not
go
out
to
work
with
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
crew
,
unless
when
their
ransom
is
delayed
;
for
then
,
to
make
them
write
*NL*
for
it
more
pressingly
,
they
compel
them
to
work
and
go
for
wood
,
which
*NL*
is
no
light
labour
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
however
,
was
one
of
those
on
ransom
,
for
when
it
was
discovered
that
I
*NL*
was
a
captain
,
although
I
declared
my
scanty
means
and
want
of
fortune
,
*NL*
nothing
could
dissuade
them
from
including
me
among
the
gentlemen
and
*NL*
those
waiting
to
be
ransomed
.
They
put
a
chain
on
me
,
more
as
a
mark
of
*NL*
this
than
to
keep
me
safe
,
and
so
I
passed
my
life
in
that
bano
with
*NL*
several
other
gentlemen
and
persons
of
quality
marked
out
as
held
to
*NL*
ransom
;
but
though
at
times
,
or
rather
almost
always
,
we
suffered
from
*NL*
hunger
and
scanty
clothing
,
nothing
distressed
us
so
much
as
hearing
and
*NL*
seeing
at
every
turn
the
unexampled
and
unheard-of
cruelties
my
master
*NL*
inflicted
upon
the
Christians
.
Every
day
he
hanged
a
man
,
impaled
one
,
*NL*
cut
off
the
ears
of
another
;
and
all
with
so
little
provocation
,
or
so
*NL*
entirely
without
any
,
that
the
Turks
acknowledged
he
did
it
merely
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
doing
it
,
and
because
he
was
by
nature
murderously
disposed
*NL*
towards
the
whole
human
race
.
The
only
one
that
fared
at
all
well
with
*NL*
him
was
a
Spanish
soldier
,
something
de
Saavedra
by
name
,
to
whom
he
*NL*
never
gave
a
blow
himself
,
or
ordered
a
blow
to
be
given
,
or
addressed
a
*NL*
hard
word
,
although
he
had
done
things
that
will
dwell
in
the
memory
of
*NL*
the
people
there
for
many
a
year
,
and
all
to
recover
his
liberty
;
and
for
*NL*
the
least
of
the
many
things
he
did
we
all
dreaded
that
he
would
be
*NL*
impaled
,
and
he
himself
was
in
fear
of
it
more
than
once
;
and
only
that
*NL*
time
does
not
allow
,
I
could
tell
you
now
something
of
what
that
soldier
*NL*
did
,
that
would
interest
and
astonish
you
much
more
than
the
narration
of
*NL*
my
own
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
go
on
with
my
story
;
the
courtyard
of
our
prison
was
overlooked
by
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
house
belonging
to
a
wealthy
Moor
of
high
position
;
and
*NL*
these
,
as
is
usual
in
Moorish
houses
,
were
rather
loopholes
than
windows
,
*NL*
and
besides
were
covered
with
thick
and
close
lattice-work
.
It
so
*NL*
happened
,
then
,
that
as
I
was
one
day
on
the
terrace
of
our
prison
with
*NL*
three
other
comrades
,
trying
,
to
pass
away
the
time
,
how
far
we
could
*NL*
leap
with
our
chains
,
we
being
alone
,
for
all
the
other
Christians
had
*NL*
gone
out
to
work
,
I
chanced
to
raise
my
eyes
,
and
from
one
of
these
*NL*
little
closed
windows
I
saw
a
reed
appear
with
a
cloth
attached
to
the
*NL*
end
of
it
,
and
it
kept
waving
to
and
fro
,
and
moving
as
if
making
signs
*NL*
to
us
to
come
and
take
it
.
We
watched
it
,
and
one
of
those
who
were
with
*NL*
me
went
and
stood
under
the
reed
to
see
whether
they
would
let
it
drop
,
*NL*
or
what
they
would
do
,
but
as
he
did
so
the
reed
was
raised
and
moved
*NL*
from
side
to
side
,
as
if
they
meant
to
say
``
no
''
by
a
shake
of
the
head
.
*NL*
The
Christian
came
back
,
and
it
was
again
lowered
,
making
the
same
*NL*
movements
as
before
.
Another
of
my
comrades
went
,
and
with
him
the
same
*NL*
happened
as
with
the
first
,
and
then
the
third
went
forward
,
but
with
the
*NL*
same
result
as
the
first
and
second
.
Seeing
this
I
did
not
like
not
to
*NL*
try
my
luck
,
and
as
soon
as
I
came
under
the
reed
it
was
dropped
and
fell
*NL*
inside
the
bano
at
my
feet
.
I
hastened
to
untie
the
cloth
,
in
which
I
*NL*
perceived
a
knot
,
and
in
this
were
ten
cianis
,
which
are
coins
of
base
*NL*
gold
,
current
among
the
Moors
,
and
each
worth
ten
reals
of
our
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
needless
to
say
I
rejoiced
over
this
godsend
,
and
my
joy
was
not
*NL*
less
than
my
wonder
as
I
strove
to
imagine
how
this
good
fortune
could
*NL*
have
come
to
us
,
but
to
me
specially
;
for
the
evident
unwillingness
to
*NL*
drop
the
reed
for
any
but
me
showed
that
it
was
for
me
the
favour
was
*NL*
intended
.
I
took
my
welcome
money
,
broke
the
reed
,
and
returned
to
the
*NL*
terrace
,
and
looking
up
at
the
window
,
I
saw
a
very
white
hand
put
out
*NL*
that
opened
and
shut
very
quickly
.
From
this
we
gathered
or
fancied
that
*NL*
it
must
be
some
woman
living
in
that
house
that
had
done
us
this
*NL*
kindness
,
and
to
show
that
we
were
grateful
for
it
,
we
made
salaams
after
*NL*
the
fashion
of
the
Moors
,
bowing
the
head
,
bending
the
body
,
and
crossing
*NL*
the
arms
on
the
breast
.
Shortly
afterwards
at
the
same
window
a
small
*NL*
cross
made
of
reeds
was
put
out
and
immediately
withdrawn
.
This
sign
led
*NL*
us
to
believe
that
some
Christian
woman
was
a
captive
in
the
house
,
and
*NL*
that
it
was
she
who
had
been
so
good
to
us
;
but
the
whiteness
of
the
hand
*NL*
and
the
bracelets
we
had
perceived
made
us
dismiss
that
idea
,
though
we
*NL*
thought
it
might
be
one
of
the
Christian
renegades
whom
their
masters
*NL*
very
often
take
as
lawful
wives
,
and
gladly
,
for
they
prefer
them
to
the
*NL*
women
of
their
own
nation
.
In
all
our
conjectures
we
were
wide
of
the
*NL*
truth
;
so
from
that
time
forward
our
sole
occupation
was
watching
and
*NL*
gazing
at
the
window
where
the
cross
had
appeared
to
us
,
as
if
it
were
*NL*
our
pole-star
;
but
at
least
fifteen
days
passed
without
our
seeing
either
*NL*
it
or
the
hand
,
or
any
other
sign
and
though
meanwhile
we
endeavoured
*NL*
with
the
utmost
pains
to
ascertain
who
it
was
that
lived
in
the
house
,
*NL*
and
whether
there
were
any
Christian
renegade
in
it
,
nobody
could
ever
*NL*
tell
us
anything
more
than
that
he
who
lived
there
was
a
rich
Moor
of
*NL*
high
position
,
Hadji
Morato
by
name
,
formerly
alcaide
of
La
Pata
,
an
*NL*
office
of
high
dignity
among
them
.
But
when
we
least
thought
it
was
going
*NL*
to
rain
any
more
cianis
from
that
quarter
,
we
saw
the
reed
suddenly
*NL*
appear
with
another
cloth
tied
in
a
larger
knot
attached
to
it
,
and
this
*NL*
at
a
time
when
,
as
on
the
former
occasion
,
the
bano
was
deserted
and
*NL*
unoccupied
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
trial
as
before
,
each
of
the
same
three
going
forward
before
I
*NL*
did
;
but
the
reed
was
delivered
to
none
but
me
,
and
on
my
approach
it
was
*NL*
let
drop
.
I
untied
the
knot
and
I
found
forty
Spanish
gold
crowns
with
a
*NL*
paper
written
in
Arabic
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
writing
there
was
a
large
*NL*
cross
drawn
.
I
kissed
the
cross
,
took
the
crowns
and
returned
to
the
*NL*
terrace
,
and
we
all
made
our
salaams
;
again
the
hand
appeared
,
I
made
*NL*
signs
that
I
would
read
the
paper
,
and
then
the
window
was
closed
.
We
*NL*
were
all
puzzled
,
though
filled
with
joy
at
what
had
taken
place
;
and
as
*NL*
none
of
us
understood
Arabic
,
great
was
our
curiosity
to
know
what
the
*NL*
paper
contained
,
and
still
greater
the
difficulty
of
finding
some
one
to
*NL*
read
it
.
At
last
I
resolved
to
confide
in
a
renegade
,
a
native
of
Murcia
,
*NL*
who
professed
a
very
great
friendship
for
me
,
and
had
given
pledges
that
*NL*
bound
him
to
keep
any
secret
I
might
entrust
to
him
;
for
it
is
the
custom
*NL*
with
some
renegades
,
when
they
intend
to
return
to
Christian
territory
,
*NL*
to
carry
about
them
certificates
from
captives
of
mark
testifying
,
in
*NL*
whatever
form
they
can
,
that
such
and
such
a
renegade
is
a
worthy
man
who
*NL*
has
always
shown
kindness
to
Christians
,
and
is
anxious
to
escape
on
the
*NL*
first
opportunity
that
may
present
itself
.
Some
obtain
these
testimonials
*NL*
with
good
intentions
,
others
put
them
to
a
cunning
use
;
for
when
they
go
*NL*
to
pillage
on
Christian
territory
,
if
they
chance
to
be
cast
away
,
or
*NL*
taken
prisoners
,
they
produce
their
certificates
and
say
that
from
these
*NL*
papers
may
be
seen
the
object
they
came
for
,
which
was
to
remain
on
*NL*
Christian
ground
,
and
that
it
was
to
this
end
they
joined
the
Turks
in
*NL*
their
foray
.
In
this
way
they
escape
the
consequences
of
the
first
*NL*
outburst
and
make
their
peace
with
the
Church
before
it
does
them
any
*NL*
harm
,
and
then
when
they
have
the
chance
they
return
to
Barbary
to
become
*NL*
what
they
were
before
.
Others
,
however
,
there
are
who
procure
these
*NL*
papers
and
make
use
of
them
honestly
,
and
remain
on
Christian
soil
.
This
*NL*
friend
of
mine
,
then
,
was
one
of
these
renegades
that
I
have
described
;
*NL*
he
had
certificates
from
all
our
comrades
,
in
which
we
testified
in
his
*NL*
favour
as
strongly
as
we
could
;
and
if
the
Moors
had
found
the
papers
*NL*
they
would
have
burned
him
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
that
he
understood
Arabic
very
well
,
and
could
not
only
speak
but
*NL*
also
write
it
;
but
before
I
disclosed
the
whole
matter
to
him
,
I
asked
*NL*
him
to
read
for
me
this
paper
which
I
had
found
by
accident
in
a
hole
in
*NL*
my
cell
.
He
opened
it
and
remained
some
time
examining
it
and
muttering
*NL*
to
himself
as
he
translated
it
.
I
asked
him
if
he
understood
it
,
and
he
*NL*
told
me
he
did
perfectly
well
,
and
that
if
I
wished
him
to
tell
me
its
*NL*
meaning
word
for
word
,
I
must
give
him
pen
and
ink
that
he
might
do
it
*NL*
more
satisfactorily
.
We
at
once
gave
him
what
he
required
,
and
he
set
*NL*
about
translating
it
bit
by
bit
,
and
when
he
had
done
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
is
here
in
Spanish
is
what
the
Moorish
paper
contains
,
and
you
*NL*
must
bear
in
mind
that
when
it
says
`
Lela
Marien
'
it
means
`
Our
Lady
the
*NL*
Virgin
Mary
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
read
the
paper
and
it
ran
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
a
child
my
father
had
a
slave
who
taught
me
to
pray
the
*NL*
Christian
prayer
in
my
own
language
,
and
told
me
many
things
about
Lela
*NL*
Marien
.
The
Christian
died
,
and
I
know
that
she
did
not
go
to
the
fire
,
*NL*
but
to
Allah
,
because
since
then
I
have
seen
her
twice
,
and
she
told
me
*NL*
to
go
to
the
land
of
the
Christians
to
see
Lela
Marien
,
who
had
great
*NL*
love
for
me
.
I
know
not
how
to
go
.
I
have
seen
many
Christians
,
but
*NL*
except
thyself
none
has
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
gentleman
.
I
am
young
and
*NL*
beautiful
,
and
have
plenty
of
money
to
take
with
me
.
See
if
thou
canst
*NL*
contrive
how
we
may
go
,
and
if
thou
wilt
thou
shalt
be
my
husband
there
,
*NL*
and
if
thou
wilt
not
it
will
not
distress
me
,
for
Lela
Marien
will
find
*NL*
me
some
one
to
marry
me
.
I
myself
have
written
this
:
have
a
care
to
whom
*NL*
thou
givest
it
to
read
:
trust
no
Moor
,
for
they
are
all
perfidious
.
I
am
*NL*
greatly
troubled
on
this
account
,
for
I
would
not
have
thee
confide
in
*NL*
anyone
,
because
if
my
father
knew
it
he
would
at
once
fling
me
down
a
*NL*
well
and
cover
me
with
stones
.
I
will
put
a
thread
to
the
reed
;
tie
the
*NL*
answer
to
it
,
and
if
thou
hast
no
one
to
write
for
thee
in
Arabic
,
tell
*NL*
it
to
me
by
signs
,
for
Lela
Marien
will
make
me
understand
thee
.
She
and
*NL*
Allah
and
this
cross
,
which
I
often
kiss
as
the
captive
bade
me
,
protect
*NL*
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
,
sirs
,
whether
we
had
reason
for
surprise
and
joy
at
the
words
of
*NL*
this
paper
;
and
both
one
and
the
other
were
so
great
,
that
the
renegade
*NL*
perceived
that
the
paper
had
not
been
found
by
chance
,
but
had
been
in
*NL*
reality
addressed
to
some
one
of
us
,
and
he
begged
us
,
if
what
he
*NL*
suspected
were
the
truth
,
to
trust
him
and
tell
him
all
,
for
he
would
*NL*
risk
his
life
for
our
freedom
;
and
so
saying
he
took
out
from
his
breast
*NL*
a
metal
crucifix
,
and
with
many
tears
swore
by
the
God
the
image
*NL*
represented
,
in
whom
,
sinful
and
wicked
as
he
was
,
he
truly
and
*NL*
faithfully
believed
,
to
be
loyal
to
us
and
keep
secret
whatever
we
chose
*NL*
to
reveal
to
him
;
for
he
thought
and
almost
foresaw
that
by
means
of
her
*NL*
who
had
written
that
paper
,
he
and
all
of
us
would
obtain
our
liberty
,
*NL*
and
he
himself
obtain
the
object
he
so
much
desired
,
his
restoration
to
*NL*
the
bosom
of
the
Holy
Mother
Church
,
from
which
by
his
own
sin
and
*NL*
ignorance
he
was
now
severed
like
a
corrupt
limb
.
The
renegade
said
this
*NL*
with
so
many
tears
and
such
signs
of
repentance
,
that
with
one
consent
we
*NL*
all
agreed
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
,
and
so
we
gave
him
*NL*
a
full
account
of
all
,
without
hiding
anything
from
him
.
We
pointed
out
*NL*
to
him
the
window
at
which
the
reed
appeared
,
and
he
by
that
means
took
*NL*
note
of
the
house
,
and
resolved
to
ascertain
with
particular
care
who
*NL*
lived
in
it
.
We
agreed
also
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
answer
the
*NL*
Moorish
lady
's
letter
,
and
the
renegade
without
a
moment
's
delay
took
*NL*
down
the
words
I
dictated
to
him
,
which
were
exactly
what
I
shall
tell
*NL*
you
,
for
nothing
of
importance
that
took
place
in
this
affair
has
escaped
*NL*
my
memory
,
or
ever
will
while
life
lasts
.
This
,
then
,
was
the
answer
*NL*
returned
to
the
Moorish
lady
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
true
Allah
protect
thee
,
Lady
,
and
that
blessed
Marien
who
is
the
*NL*
true
mother
of
God
,
and
who
has
put
it
into
thy
heart
to
go
to
the
land
*NL*
of
the
Christians
,
because
she
loves
thee
.
Entreat
her
that
she
be
*NL*
pleased
to
show
thee
how
thou
canst
execute
the
command
she
gives
thee
,
*NL*
for
she
will
,
such
is
her
goodness
.
On
my
own
part
,
and
on
that
of
all
*NL*
these
Christians
who
are
with
me
,
I
promise
to
do
all
that
we
can
for
*NL*
thee
,
even
to
death
.
Fail
not
to
write
to
me
and
inform
me
what
thou
dost
*NL*
mean
to
do
,
and
I
will
always
answer
thee
;
for
the
great
Allah
has
given
*NL*
us
a
Christian
captive
who
can
speak
and
write
thy
language
well
,
as
thou
*NL*
mayest
see
by
this
paper
;
without
fear
,
therefore
,
thou
canst
inform
us
*NL*
of
all
thou
wouldst
.
As
to
what
thou
sayest
,
that
if
thou
dost
reach
the
*NL*
land
of
the
Christians
thou
wilt
be
my
wife
,
I
give
thee
my
promise
upon
*NL*
it
as
a
good
Christian
;
and
know
that
the
Christians
keep
their
promises
*NL*
better
than
the
Moors
.
Allah
and
Marien
his
mother
watch
over
thee
,
my
*NL*
Lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
paper
being
written
and
folded
I
waited
two
days
until
the
bano
was
*NL*
empty
as
before
,
and
immediately
repaired
to
the
usual
walk
on
the
*NL*
terrace
to
see
if
there
were
any
sign
of
the
reed
,
which
was
not
long
in
*NL*
making
its
appearance
.
As
soon
as
I
saw
it
,
although
I
could
not
*NL*
distinguish
who
put
it
out
,
I
showed
the
paper
as
a
sign
to
attach
the
*NL*
thread
,
but
it
was
already
fixed
to
the
reed
,
and
to
it
I
tied
the
paper
;
*NL*
and
shortly
afterwards
our
star
once
more
made
its
appearance
with
the
*NL*
white
flag
of
peace
,
the
little
bundle
.
It
was
dropped
,
and
I
picked
it
*NL*
up
,
and
found
in
the
cloth
,
in
gold
and
silver
coins
of
all
sorts
,
more
*NL*
than
fifty
crowns
,
which
fifty
times
more
strengthened
our
joy
and
*NL*
doubled
our
hope
of
gaining
our
liberty
.
That
very
night
our
renegade
*NL*
returned
and
said
he
had
learned
that
the
Moor
we
had
been
told
of
lived
*NL*
in
that
house
,
that
his
name
was
Hadji
Morato
,
that
he
was
enormously
*NL*
rich
,
that
he
had
one
only
daughter
the
heiress
of
all
his
wealth
,
and
*NL*
that
it
was
the
general
opinion
throughout
the
city
that
she
was
the
most
*NL*
beautiful
woman
in
Barbary
,
and
that
several
of
the
viceroys
who
came
*NL*
there
had
sought
her
for
a
wife
,
but
that
she
had
been
always
unwilling
*NL*
to
marry
;
and
he
had
learned
,
moreover
,
that
she
had
a
Christian
slave
*NL*
who
was
now
dead
;
all
which
agreed
with
the
contents
of
the
paper
.
We
*NL*
immediately
took
counsel
with
the
renegade
as
to
what
means
would
have
to
*NL*
be
adopted
in
order
to
carry
off
the
Moorish
lady
and
bring
us
all
to
*NL*
Christian
territory
;
and
in
the
end
it
was
agreed
that
for
the
present
we
*NL*
should
wait
for
a
second
communication
from
Zoraida
-LRB-
for
that
was
the
*NL*
name
of
her
who
now
desires
to
be
called
Maria
-RRB-
,
because
we
saw
clearly
*NL*
that
she
and
no
one
else
could
find
a
way
out
of
all
these
difficulties
.
*NL*
When
we
had
decided
upon
this
the
renegade
told
us
not
to
be
uneasy
,
for
*NL*
he
would
lose
his
life
or
restore
us
to
liberty
.
For
four
days
the
bano
*NL*
was
filled
with
people
,
for
which
reason
the
reed
delayed
its
appearance
*NL*
for
four
days
,
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
,
when
the
bano
was
,
as
it
*NL*
generally
was
,
empty
,
it
appeared
with
the
cloth
so
bulky
that
it
*NL*
promised
a
happy
birth
.
Reed
and
cloth
came
down
to
me
,
and
I
found
*NL*
another
paper
and
a
hundred
crowns
in
gold
,
without
any
other
coin
.
The
*NL*
renegade
was
present
,
and
in
our
cell
we
gave
him
the
paper
to
read
,
*NL*
which
was
to
this
effect
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
think
of
a
plan
,
senor
,
for
our
going
to
Spain
,
nor
has
Lela
*NL*
Marien
shown
me
one
,
though
I
have
asked
her
.
All
that
can
be
done
is
for
*NL*
me
to
give
you
plenty
of
money
in
gold
from
this
window
.
With
it
ransom
*NL*
yourself
and
your
friends
,
and
let
one
of
you
go
to
the
land
of
the
*NL*
Christians
,
and
there
buy
a
vessel
and
come
back
for
the
others
;
and
he
*NL*
will
find
me
in
my
father
's
garden
,
which
is
at
the
Babazon
gate
near
the
*NL*
seashore
,
where
I
shall
be
all
this
summer
with
my
father
and
my
*NL*
servants
.
You
can
carry
me
away
from
there
by
night
without
any
danger
,
*NL*
and
bring
me
to
the
vessel
.
And
remember
thou
art
to
be
my
husband
,
else
*NL*
I
will
pray
to
Marien
to
punish
thee
.
If
thou
canst
not
trust
anyone
to
*NL*
go
for
the
vessel
,
ransom
thyself
and
do
thou
go
,
for
I
know
thou
wilt
*NL*
return
more
surely
than
any
other
,
as
thou
art
a
gentleman
and
a
*NL*
Christian
.
Endeavour
to
make
thyself
acquainted
with
the
garden
;
and
when
*NL*
I
see
thee
walking
yonder
I
shall
know
that
the
bano
is
empty
and
I
will
*NL*
give
thee
abundance
of
money
.
Allah
protect
thee
,
senor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
words
and
contents
of
the
second
paper
,
and
on
hearing
*NL*
them
,
each
declared
himself
willing
to
be
the
ransomed
one
,
and
promised
*NL*
to
go
and
return
with
scrupulous
good
faith
;
and
I
too
made
the
same
*NL*
offer
;
but
to
all
this
the
renegade
objected
,
saying
that
he
would
not
on
*NL*
any
account
consent
to
one
being
set
free
before
all
went
together
,
as
*NL*
experience
had
taught
him
how
ill
those
who
have
been
set
free
keep
*NL*
promises
which
they
made
in
captivity
;
for
captives
of
distinction
*NL*
frequently
had
recourse
to
this
plan
,
paying
the
ransom
of
one
who
was
to
*NL*
go
to
Valencia
or
Majorca
with
money
to
enable
him
to
arm
a
bark
and
*NL*
return
for
the
others
who
had
ransomed
him
,
but
who
never
came
back
;
for
*NL*
recovered
liberty
and
the
dread
of
losing
it
again
efface
from
the
memory
*NL*
all
the
obligations
in
the
world
.
And
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
he
said
,
*NL*
he
told
us
briefly
what
had
happened
to
a
certain
Christian
gentleman
*NL*
almost
at
that
very
time
,
the
strangest
case
that
had
ever
occurred
even
*NL*
there
,
where
astonishing
and
marvellous
things
are
happening
every
*NL*
instant
.
In
short
,
he
ended
by
saying
that
what
could
and
ought
to
be
*NL*
done
was
to
give
the
money
intended
for
the
ransom
of
one
of
us
*NL*
Christians
to
him
,
so
that
he
might
with
it
buy
a
vessel
there
in
Algiers
*NL*
under
the
pretence
of
becoming
a
merchant
and
trader
at
Tetuan
and
along
*NL*
the
coast
;
and
when
master
of
the
vessel
,
it
would
be
easy
for
him
to
hit
*NL*
on
some
way
of
getting
us
all
out
of
the
bano
and
putting
us
on
board
;
*NL*
especially
if
the
Moorish
lady
gave
,
as
she
said
,
money
enough
to
ransom
*NL*
all
,
because
once
free
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
us
*NL*
to
embark
even
in
open
day
;
but
the
greatest
difficulty
was
that
the
*NL*
Moors
do
not
allow
any
renegade
to
buy
or
own
any
craft
,
unless
it
be
a
*NL*
large
vessel
for
going
on
roving
expeditions
,
because
they
are
afraid
*NL*
that
anyone
who
buys
a
small
vessel
,
especially
if
he
be
a
Spaniard
,
only
*NL*
wants
it
for
the
purpose
of
escaping
to
Christian
territory
.
This
however
*NL*
he
could
get
over
by
arranging
with
a
Tagarin
Moor
to
go
shares
with
him
*NL*
in
the
purchase
of
the
vessel
,
and
in
the
profit
on
the
cargo
;
and
under
*NL*
cover
of
this
he
could
become
master
of
the
vessel
,
in
which
case
he
*NL*
looked
upon
all
the
rest
as
accomplished
.
But
though
to
me
and
my
*NL*
comrades
it
had
seemed
a
better
plan
to
send
to
Majorca
for
the
vessel
,
*NL*
as
the
Moorish
lady
suggested
,
we
did
not
dare
to
oppose
him
,
fearing
*NL*
that
if
we
did
not
do
as
he
said
he
would
denounce
us
,
and
place
us
in
*NL*
danger
of
losing
all
our
lives
if
he
were
to
disclose
our
dealings
with
*NL*
Zoraida
,
for
whose
life
we
would
have
all
given
our
own
.
We
therefore
*NL*
resolved
to
put
ourselves
in
the
hands
of
God
and
in
the
renegade
's
;
and
*NL*
at
the
same
time
an
answer
was
given
to
Zoraida
,
telling
her
that
we
*NL*
would
do
all
she
recommended
,
for
she
had
given
as
good
advice
as
if
Lela
*NL*
Marien
had
delivered
it
,
and
that
it
depended
on
her
alone
whether
we
*NL*
were
to
defer
the
business
or
put
it
in
execution
at
once
.
I
renewed
my
*NL*
promise
to
be
her
husband
;
and
thus
the
next
day
that
the
bano
chanced
to
*NL*
be
empty
she
at
different
times
gave
us
by
means
of
the
reed
and
cloth
*NL*
two
thousand
gold
crowns
and
a
paper
in
which
she
said
that
the
next
*NL*
Juma
,
that
is
to
say
Friday
,
she
was
going
to
her
father
's
garden
,
but
*NL*
that
before
she
went
she
would
give
us
more
money
;
and
if
it
were
not
*NL*
enough
we
were
to
let
her
know
,
as
she
would
give
us
as
much
as
we
asked
,
*NL*
for
her
father
had
so
much
he
would
not
miss
it
,
and
besides
she
kept
all
*NL*
the
keys
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
at
once
gave
the
renegade
five
hundred
crowns
to
buy
the
vessel
,
and
*NL*
with
eight
hundred
I
ransomed
myself
,
giving
the
money
to
a
Valencian
*NL*
merchant
who
happened
to
be
in
Algiers
at
the
time
,
and
who
had
me
*NL*
released
on
his
word
,
pledging
it
that
on
the
arrival
of
the
first
ship
*NL*
from
Valencia
he
would
pay
my
ransom
;
for
if
he
had
given
the
money
at
*NL*
once
it
would
have
made
the
king
suspect
that
my
ransom
money
had
been
*NL*
for
a
long
time
in
Algiers
,
and
that
the
merchant
had
for
his
own
*NL*
advantage
kept
it
secret
.
In
fact
my
master
was
so
difficult
to
deal
with
*NL*
that
I
dared
not
on
any
account
pay
down
the
money
at
once
.
The
Thursday
*NL*
before
the
Friday
on
which
the
fair
Zoraida
was
to
go
to
the
garden
she
*NL*
gave
us
a
thousand
crowns
more
,
and
warned
us
of
her
departure
,
begging
*NL*
me
,
if
I
were
ransomed
,
to
find
out
her
father
's
garden
at
once
,
and
by
*NL*
all
means
to
seek
an
opportunity
of
going
there
to
see
her
.
I
answered
in
*NL*
a
few
words
that
I
would
do
so
,
and
that
she
must
remember
to
commend
us
*NL*
to
Lela
Marien
with
all
the
prayers
the
captive
had
taught
her
.
This
*NL*
having
been
done
,
steps
were
taken
to
ransom
our
three
comrades
,
so
as
to
*NL*
enable
them
to
quit
the
bano
,
and
lest
,
seeing
me
ransomed
and
themselves
*NL*
not
,
though
the
money
was
forthcoming
,
they
should
make
a
disturbance
*NL*
about
it
and
the
devil
should
prompt
them
to
do
something
that
might
*NL*
injure
Zoraida
;
for
though
their
position
might
be
sufficient
to
relieve
*NL*
me
from
this
apprehension
,
nevertheless
I
was
unwilling
to
run
any
risk
*NL*
in
the
matter
;
and
so
I
had
them
ransomed
in
the
same
way
as
I
was
,
*NL*
handing
over
all
the
money
to
the
merchant
so
that
he
might
with
safety
*NL*
and
confidence
give
security
;
without
,
however
,
confiding
our
arrangement
*NL*
and
secret
to
him
,
which
might
have
been
dangerous
.

CHAPTER
XLI
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
THE
CAPTIVE
STILL
CONTINUES
HIS
ADVENTURES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
fifteen
days
were
over
our
renegade
had
already
purchased
an
*NL*
excellent
vessel
with
room
for
more
than
thirty
persons
;
and
to
make
the
*NL*
transaction
safe
and
lend
a
colour
to
it
,
he
thought
it
well
to
make
,
as
*NL*
he
did
,
a
voyage
to
a
place
called
Shershel
,
twenty
leagues
from
Algiers
*NL*
on
the
Oran
side
,
where
there
is
an
extensive
trade
in
dried
figs
.
Two
or
*NL*
three
times
he
made
this
voyage
in
company
with
the
Tagarin
already
*NL*
mentioned
.
The
Moors
of
Aragon
are
called
Tagarins
in
Barbary
,
and
those
*NL*
of
Granada
Mudejars
;
but
in
the
Kingdom
of
Fez
they
call
the
Mudejars
*NL*
Elches
,
and
they
are
the
people
the
king
chiefly
employs
in
war
.
To
*NL*
proceed
:
every
time
he
passed
with
his
vessel
he
anchored
in
a
cove
that
*NL*
was
not
two
crossbow
shots
from
the
garden
where
Zoraida
was
waiting
;
and
*NL*
there
the
renegade
,
together
with
the
two
Moorish
lads
that
rowed
,
used
*NL*
purposely
to
station
himself
,
either
going
through
his
prayers
,
or
else
*NL*
practising
as
a
part
what
he
meant
to
perform
in
earnest
.
And
thus
he
*NL*
would
go
to
Zoraida
's
garden
and
ask
for
fruit
,
which
her
father
gave
*NL*
him
,
not
knowing
him
;
but
though
,
as
he
afterwards
told
me
,
he
sought
to
*NL*
speak
to
Zoraida
,
and
tell
her
who
he
was
,
and
that
by
my
orders
he
was
*NL*
to
take
her
to
the
land
of
the
Christians
,
so
that
she
might
feel
*NL*
satisfied
and
easy
,
he
had
never
been
able
to
do
so
;
for
the
Moorish
*NL*
women
do
not
allow
themselves
to
be
seen
by
any
Moor
or
Turk
,
unless
*NL*
their
husband
or
father
bid
them
:
with
Christian
captives
they
permit
*NL*
freedom
of
intercourse
and
communication
,
even
more
than
might
be
*NL*
considered
proper
.
But
for
my
part
I
should
have
been
sorry
if
he
had
*NL*
spoken
to
her
,
for
perhaps
it
might
have
alarmed
her
to
find
her
affairs
*NL*
talked
of
by
renegades
.
But
God
,
who
ordered
it
otherwise
,
afforded
no
*NL*
opportunity
for
our
renegade
's
well-meant
purpose
;
and
he
,
seeing
how
*NL*
safely
he
could
go
to
Shershel
and
return
,
and
anchor
when
and
how
and
*NL*
where
he
liked
,
and
that
the
Tagarin
his
partner
had
no
will
but
his
,
and
*NL*
that
,
now
I
was
ransomed
,
all
we
wanted
was
to
find
some
Christians
to
*NL*
row
,
told
me
to
look
out
for
any
I
should
be
willing
to
take
with
me
,
*NL*
over
and
above
those
who
had
been
ransomed
,
and
to
engage
them
for
the
*NL*
next
Friday
,
which
he
fixed
upon
for
our
departure
.
On
this
I
spoke
to
*NL*
twelve
Spaniards
,
all
stout
rowers
,
and
such
as
could
most
easily
leave
*NL*
the
city
;
but
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
find
so
many
just
then
,
because
*NL*
there
were
twenty
ships
out
on
a
cruise
and
they
had
taken
all
the
rowers
*NL*
with
them
;
and
these
would
not
have
been
found
were
it
not
that
their
*NL*
master
remained
at
home
that
summer
without
going
to
sea
in
order
to
*NL*
finish
a
galliot
that
he
had
upon
the
stocks
.
To
these
men
I
said
nothing
*NL*
more
than
that
the
next
Friday
in
the
evening
they
were
to
come
out
*NL*
stealthily
one
by
one
and
hang
about
Hadji
Morato
's
garden
,
waiting
for
*NL*
me
there
until
I
came
.
These
directions
I
gave
each
one
separately
,
with
*NL*
orders
that
if
they
saw
any
other
Christians
there
they
were
not
to
say
*NL*
anything
to
them
except
that
I
had
directed
them
to
wait
at
that
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
preliminary
having
been
settled
,
another
still
more
necessary
step
*NL*
had
to
be
taken
,
which
was
to
let
Zoraida
know
how
matters
stood
that
she
*NL*
might
be
prepared
and
forewarned
,
so
as
not
to
be
taken
by
surprise
if
we
*NL*
were
suddenly
to
seize
upon
her
before
she
thought
the
Christians
'
vessel
*NL*
could
have
returned
.
I
determined
,
therefore
,
to
go
to
the
garden
and
try
*NL*
if
I
could
speak
to
her
;
and
the
day
before
my
departure
I
went
there
*NL*
under
the
pretence
of
gathering
herbs
.
The
first
person
I
met
was
her
*NL*
father
,
who
addressed
me
in
the
language
that
all
over
Barbary
and
even
*NL*
in
Constantinople
is
the
medium
between
captives
and
Moors
,
and
is
*NL*
neither
Morisco
nor
Castilian
,
nor
of
any
other
nation
,
but
a
mixture
of
*NL*
all
languages
,
by
means
of
which
we
can
all
understand
one
another
.
In
*NL*
this
sort
of
language
,
I
say
,
he
asked
me
what
I
wanted
in
his
garden
,
*NL*
and
to
whom
I
belonged
.
I
replied
that
I
was
a
slave
of
the
Arnaut
Mami
*NL*
-LRB-
for
I
knew
as
a
certainty
that
he
was
a
very
great
friend
of
his
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
that
I
wanted
some
herbs
to
make
a
salad
.
He
asked
me
then
whether
I
were
*NL*
on
ransom
or
not
,
and
what
my
master
demanded
for
me
.
While
these
*NL*
questions
and
answers
were
proceeding
,
the
fair
Zoraida
,
who
had
already
*NL*
perceived
me
some
time
before
,
came
out
of
the
house
in
the
garden
,
and
*NL*
as
Moorish
women
are
by
no
means
particular
about
letting
themselves
be
*NL*
seen
by
Christians
,
or
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
at
all
coy
,
she
had
no
*NL*
hesitation
in
coming
to
where
her
father
stood
with
me
;
moreover
her
*NL*
father
,
seeing
her
approaching
slowly
,
called
to
her
to
come
.
It
would
be
*NL*
beyond
my
power
now
to
describe
to
you
the
great
beauty
,
the
high-bred
*NL*
air
,
the
brilliant
attire
of
my
beloved
Zoraida
as
she
presented
herself
*NL*
before
my
eyes
.
I
will
content
myself
with
saying
that
more
pearls
hung
*NL*
from
her
fair
neck
,
her
ears
,
and
her
hair
than
she
had
hairs
on
her
*NL*
head
.
On
her
ankles
,
which
as
is
customary
were
bare
,
she
had
carcajes
*NL*
-LRB-
for
so
bracelets
or
anklets
are
called
in
Morisco
-RRB-
of
the
purest
gold
,
*NL*
set
with
so
many
diamonds
that
she
told
me
afterwards
her
father
valued
*NL*
them
at
ten
thousand
doubloons
,
and
those
she
had
on
her
wrists
were
*NL*
worth
as
much
more
.
The
pearls
were
in
profusion
and
very
fine
,
for
the
*NL*
highest
display
and
adornment
of
the
Moorish
women
is
decking
themselves
*NL*
with
rich
pearls
and
seed-pearls
;
and
of
these
there
are
therefore
more
*NL*
among
the
Moors
than
among
any
other
people
.
Zoraida
's
father
had
to
the
*NL*
reputation
of
possessing
a
great
number
,
and
the
purest
in
all
Algiers
,
*NL*
and
of
possessing
also
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
Spanish
crowns
;
and
*NL*
she
,
who
is
now
mistress
of
me
only
,
was
mistress
of
all
this
.
Whether
*NL*
thus
adorned
she
would
have
been
beautiful
or
not
,
and
what
she
must
have
*NL*
been
in
her
prosperity
,
may
be
imagined
from
the
beauty
remaining
to
her
*NL*
after
so
many
hardships
;
for
,
as
everyone
knows
,
the
beauty
of
some
women
*NL*
has
its
times
and
its
seasons
,
and
is
increased
or
diminished
by
chance
*NL*
causes
;
and
naturally
the
emotions
of
the
mind
will
heighten
or
impair
*NL*
it
,
though
indeed
more
frequently
they
totally
destroy
it
.
In
a
word
she
*NL*
presented
herself
before
me
that
day
attired
with
the
utmost
splendour
,
*NL*
and
supremely
beautiful
;
at
any
rate
,
she
seemed
to
me
the
most
beautiful
*NL*
object
I
had
ever
seen
;
and
when
,
besides
,
I
thought
of
all
I
owed
to
her
*NL*
I
felt
as
though
I
had
before
me
some
heavenly
being
come
to
earth
to
*NL*
bring
me
relief
and
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
approached
her
father
told
her
in
his
own
language
that
I
was
a
*NL*
captive
belonging
to
his
friend
the
Arnaut
Mami
,
and
that
I
had
come
for
*NL*
salad
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
up
the
conversation
,
and
in
that
mixture
of
tongues
I
have
*NL*
spoken
of
she
asked
me
if
I
was
a
gentleman
,
and
why
I
was
not
ransomed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
that
I
was
already
ransomed
,
and
that
by
the
price
it
might
be
*NL*
seen
what
value
my
master
set
on
me
,
as
I
had
given
one
thousand
five
*NL*
hundred
zoltanis
for
me
;
to
which
she
replied
,
``
Hadst
thou
been
my
*NL*
father
's
,
I
can
tell
thee
,
I
would
not
have
let
him
part
with
thee
for
*NL*
twice
as
much
,
for
you
Christians
always
tell
lies
about
yourselves
and
*NL*
make
yourselves
out
poor
to
cheat
the
Moors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
,
lady
,
''
said
I
;
``
but
indeed
I
dealt
truthfully
with
my
*NL*
master
,
as
I
do
and
mean
to
do
with
everybody
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
dost
thou
go
?
''
said
Zoraida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
I
think
,
''
said
I
,
``
for
there
is
a
vessel
here
from
France
*NL*
which
sails
to-morrow
,
and
I
think
I
shall
go
in
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
not
be
better
,
''
said
Zoraida
,
``
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
ships
*NL*
from
Spain
and
go
with
them
and
not
with
the
French
who
are
not
your
*NL*
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
;
``
though
if
there
were
intelligence
that
a
vessel
were
now
*NL*
coming
from
Spain
it
is
true
I
might
,
perhaps
,
wait
for
it
;
however
,
it
*NL*
is
more
likely
I
shall
depart
to-morrow
,
for
the
longing
I
feel
to
return
*NL*
to
my
country
and
to
those
I
love
is
so
great
that
it
will
not
allow
me
*NL*
to
wait
for
another
opportunity
,
however
more
convenient
,
if
it
be
*NL*
delayed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
thou
art
married
in
thine
own
country
,
''
said
Zoraida
,
``
and
for
*NL*
that
reason
thou
art
anxious
to
go
and
see
thy
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
married
,
''
I
replied
,
``
but
I
have
given
my
promise
to
marry
on
*NL*
my
arrival
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
the
lady
beautiful
to
whom
thou
hast
given
it
?
''
said
Zoraida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
beautiful
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
,
to
describe
her
worthily
and
tell
thee
the
*NL*
truth
,
she
is
very
like
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
her
father
laughed
very
heartily
and
said
,
``
By
Allah
,
Christian
,
*NL*
she
must
be
very
beautiful
if
she
is
like
my
daughter
,
who
is
the
most
*NL*
beautiful
woman
in
all
this
kingdom
:
only
look
at
her
well
and
thou
wilt
*NL*
see
I
am
telling
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zoraida
's
father
as
the
better
linguist
helped
to
interpret
most
of
these
*NL*
words
and
phrases
,
for
though
she
spoke
the
bastard
language
,
that
,
as
I
*NL*
have
said
,
is
employed
there
,
she
expressed
her
meaning
more
by
signs
*NL*
than
by
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
still
engaged
in
this
conversation
,
a
Moor
came
running
up
,
*NL*
exclaiming
that
four
Turks
had
leaped
over
the
fence
or
wall
of
the
*NL*
garden
,
and
were
gathering
the
fruit
though
it
was
not
yet
ripe
.
The
old
*NL*
man
was
alarmed
and
Zoraida
too
,
for
the
Moors
commonly
,
and
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
instinctively
have
a
dread
of
the
Turks
,
but
particularly
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
who
are
so
insolent
and
domineering
to
the
Moors
who
are
under
*NL*
their
power
that
they
treat
them
worse
than
if
they
were
their
slaves
.
*NL*
Her
father
said
to
Zoraida
,
``
Daughter
,
retire
into
the
house
and
shut
*NL*
thyself
in
while
I
go
and
speak
to
these
dogs
;
and
thou
,
Christian
,
pick
*NL*
thy
herbs
,
and
go
in
peace
,
and
Allah
bring
thee
safe
to
thy
own

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
bowed
,
and
he
went
away
to
look
for
the
Turks
,
leaving
me
alone
with
*NL*
Zoraida
,
who
made
as
if
she
were
about
to
retire
as
her
father
bade
her
;
*NL*
but
the
moment
he
was
concealed
by
the
trees
of
the
garden
,
turning
to
me
*NL*
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
she
said
,
``
Tameji
,
cristiano
,
tameji
?
''
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
``
Art
thou
going
,
Christian
,
art
thou
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
answer
,
``
Yes
,
lady
,
but
not
without
thee
,
come
what
may
:
be
on
the
*NL*
watch
for
me
on
the
next
Juma
,
and
be
not
alarmed
when
thou
seest
us
;
for
*NL*
most
surely
we
shall
go
to
the
land
of
the
Christians
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
said
in
such
a
way
that
she
understood
perfectly
all
that
passed
*NL*
between
us
,
and
throwing
her
arm
round
my
neck
she
began
with
feeble
*NL*
steps
to
move
towards
the
house
;
but
as
fate
would
have
it
-LRB-
and
it
might
*NL*
have
been
very
unfortunate
if
Heaven
had
not
otherwise
ordered
it
-RRB-
,
just
*NL*
as
we
were
moving
on
in
the
manner
and
position
I
have
described
,
with
*NL*
her
arm
round
my
neck
,
her
father
,
as
he
returned
after
having
sent
away
*NL*
the
Turks
,
saw
how
we
were
walking
and
we
perceived
that
he
saw
us
;
but
*NL*
Zoraida
,
ready
and
quickwitted
,
took
care
not
to
remove
her
arm
from
my
*NL*
neck
,
but
on
the
contrary
drew
closer
to
me
and
laid
her
head
on
my
*NL*
breast
,
bending
her
knees
a
little
and
showing
all
the
signs
and
tokens
*NL*
of
fainting
,
while
I
at
the
same
time
made
it
seem
as
though
I
were
*NL*
supporting
her
against
my
will
.
Her
father
came
running
up
to
where
we
*NL*
were
,
and
seeing
his
daughter
in
this
state
asked
what
was
the
matter
*NL*
with
her
;
she
,
however
,
giving
no
answer
,
he
said
,
``
No
doubt
she
has
*NL*
fainted
in
alarm
at
the
entrance
of
those
dogs
,
''
and
taking
her
from
mine
*NL*
he
drew
her
to
his
own
breast
,
while
she
sighing
,
her
eyes
still
wet
with
*NL*
tears
,
said
again
,
``
Ameji
,
cristiano
,
ameji
''
--
``
Go
,
Christian
,
go
.
''
To
*NL*
this
her
father
replied
,
``
There
is
no
need
,
daughter
,
for
the
Christian
*NL*
to
go
,
for
he
has
done
thee
no
harm
,
and
the
Turks
have
now
gone
;
feel
no
*NL*
alarm
,
there
is
nothing
to
hurt
thee
,
for
as
I
say
,
the
Turks
at
my
*NL*
request
have
gone
back
the
way
they
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
they
who
terrified
her
,
as
thou
hast
said
,
senor
,
''
said
I
to
her
*NL*
father
;
``
but
since
she
tells
me
to
go
,
I
have
no
wish
to
displease
her
:
*NL*
peace
be
with
thee
,
and
with
thy
leave
I
will
come
back
to
this
garden
*NL*
for
herbs
if
need
be
,
for
my
master
says
there
are
nowhere
better
herbs
*NL*
for
salad
then
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
for
any
thou
hast
need
of
,
''
replied
Hadji
Morato
;
``
for
my
*NL*
daughter
does
not
speak
thus
because
she
is
displeased
with
thee
or
any
*NL*
Christian
:
she
only
meant
that
the
Turks
should
go
,
not
thou
;
or
that
it
*NL*
was
time
for
thee
to
look
for
thy
herbs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
I
at
once
took
my
leave
of
both
;
and
she
,
looking
as
though
her
*NL*
heart
were
breaking
,
retired
with
her
father
.
While
pretending
to
look
*NL*
for
herbs
I
made
the
round
of
the
garden
at
my
ease
,
and
studied
*NL*
carefully
all
the
approaches
and
outlets
,
and
the
fastenings
of
the
house
*NL*
and
everything
that
could
be
taken
advantage
of
to
make
our
task
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
done
so
I
went
and
gave
an
account
of
all
that
had
taken
place
to
*NL*
the
renegade
and
my
comrades
,
and
looked
forward
with
impatience
to
the
*NL*
hour
when
,
all
fear
at
an
end
,
I
should
find
myself
in
possession
of
the
*NL*
prize
which
fortune
held
out
to
me
in
the
fair
and
lovely
Zoraida
.
The
*NL*
time
passed
at
length
,
and
the
appointed
day
we
so
longed
for
arrived
;
*NL*
and
,
all
following
out
the
arrangement
and
plan
which
,
after
careful
*NL*
consideration
and
many
a
long
discussion
,
we
had
decided
upon
,
we
*NL*
succeeded
as
fully
as
we
could
have
wished
;
for
on
the
Friday
following
*NL*
the
day
upon
which
I
spoke
to
Zoraida
in
the
garden
,
the
renegade
*NL*
anchored
his
vessel
at
nightfall
almost
opposite
the
spot
where
she
was
.
*NL*
The
Christians
who
were
to
row
were
ready
and
in
hiding
in
different
*NL*
places
round
about
,
all
waiting
for
me
,
anxious
and
elated
,
and
eager
to
*NL*
attack
the
vessel
they
had
before
their
eyes
;
for
they
did
not
know
the
*NL*
renegade
's
plan
,
but
expected
that
they
were
to
gain
their
liberty
by
*NL*
force
of
arms
and
by
killing
the
Moors
who
were
on
board
the
vessel
.
As
*NL*
soon
,
then
,
as
I
and
my
comrades
made
our
appearance
,
all
those
that
were
*NL*
in
hiding
seeing
us
came
and
joined
us
.
It
was
now
the
time
when
the
city
*NL*
gates
are
shut
,
and
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
in
all
the
space
outside
.
*NL*
When
we
were
collected
together
we
debated
whether
it
would
be
better
*NL*
first
to
go
for
Zoraida
,
or
to
make
prisoners
of
the
Moorish
rowers
who
*NL*
rowed
in
the
vessel
;
but
while
we
were
still
uncertain
our
renegade
came
*NL*
up
asking
us
what
kept
us
,
as
it
was
now
the
time
,
and
all
the
Moors
were
*NL*
off
their
guard
and
most
of
them
asleep
.
We
told
him
why
we
hesitated
,
*NL*
but
he
said
it
was
of
more
importance
first
to
secure
the
vessel
,
which
*NL*
could
be
done
with
the
greatest
ease
and
without
any
danger
,
and
then
we
*NL*
could
go
for
Zoraida
.
We
all
approved
of
what
he
said
,
and
so
without
*NL*
further
delay
,
guided
by
him
we
made
for
the
vessel
,
and
he
leaping
on
*NL*
board
first
,
drew
his
cutlass
and
said
in
Morisco
,
``
Let
no
one
stir
from
*NL*
this
if
he
does
not
want
it
to
cost
him
his
life
.
''
By
this
almost
all
the
*NL*
Christians
were
on
board
,
and
the
Moors
,
who
were
fainthearted
,
hearing
*NL*
their
captain
speak
in
this
way
,
were
cowed
,
and
without
any
one
of
them
*NL*
taking
to
his
arms
-LRB-
and
indeed
they
had
few
or
hardly
any
-RRB-
they
submitted
*NL*
without
saying
a
word
to
be
bound
by
the
Christians
,
who
quickly
secured
*NL*
them
,
threatening
them
that
if
they
raised
any
kind
of
outcry
they
would
*NL*
be
all
put
to
the
sword
.
This
having
been
accomplished
,
and
half
of
our
*NL*
party
being
left
to
keep
guard
over
them
,
the
rest
of
us
,
again
taking
*NL*
the
renegade
as
our
guide
,
hastened
towards
Hadji
Morato
's
garden
,
and
as
*NL*
good
luck
would
have
it
,
on
trying
the
gate
it
opened
as
easily
as
if
it
*NL*
had
not
been
locked
;
and
so
,
quite
quietly
and
in
silence
,
we
reached
the
*NL*
house
without
being
perceived
by
anybody
.
The
lovely
Zoraida
was
watching
*NL*
for
us
at
a
window
,
and
as
soon
as
she
perceived
that
there
were
people
*NL*
there
,
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
if
we
were
``
Nizarani
,
''
as
much
as
to
say
*NL*
or
ask
if
we
were
Christians
.
I
answered
that
we
were
,
and
begged
her
to
*NL*
come
down
.
As
soon
as
she
recognised
me
she
did
not
delay
an
instant
,
but
*NL*
without
answering
a
word
came
down
immediately
,
opened
the
door
and
*NL*
presented
herself
before
us
all
,
so
beautiful
and
so
richly
attired
that
*NL*
I
can
not
attempt
to
describe
her
.
The
moment
I
saw
her
I
took
her
hand
*NL*
and
kissed
it
,
and
the
renegade
and
my
two
comrades
did
the
same
;
and
the
*NL*
rest
,
who
knew
nothing
of
the
circumstances
,
did
as
they
saw
us
do
,
for
*NL*
it
only
seemed
as
if
we
were
returning
thanks
to
her
,
and
recognising
her
*NL*
as
the
giver
of
our
liberty
.
The
renegade
asked
her
in
the
Morisco
*NL*
language
if
her
father
was
in
the
house
.
She
replied
that
he
was
and
that
*NL*
he
was
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
will
be
necessary
to
waken
him
and
take
him
with
us
,
''
said
the
*NL*
renegade
,
``
and
everything
of
value
in
this
fair
mansion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
she
,
``
my
father
must
not
on
any
account
be
touched
,
and
there
*NL*
is
nothing
in
the
house
except
what
I
shall
take
,
and
that
will
be
quite
*NL*
enough
to
enrich
and
satisfy
all
of
you
;
wait
a
little
and
you
shall
*NL*
see
,
''
and
so
saying
she
went
in
,
telling
us
she
would
return
immediately
*NL*
and
bidding
us
keep
quiet
making
any
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
the
renegade
what
had
passed
between
them
,
and
when
he
told
me
,
I
*NL*
declared
that
nothing
should
be
done
except
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
*NL*
of
Zoraida
,
who
now
came
back
with
a
little
trunk
so
full
of
gold
crowns
*NL*
that
she
could
scarcely
carry
it
.
Unfortunately
her
father
awoke
while
*NL*
this
was
going
on
,
and
hearing
a
noise
in
the
garden
,
came
to
the
window
,
*NL*
and
at
once
perceiving
that
all
those
who
were
there
were
Christians
,
*NL*
raising
a
prodigiously
loud
outcry
,
he
began
to
call
out
in
Arabic
,
*NL*
``
Christians
,
Christians
!
thieves
,
thieves
!
''
by
which
cries
we
were
all
*NL*
thrown
into
the
greatest
fear
and
embarrassment
;
but
the
renegade
seeing
*NL*
the
danger
we
were
in
and
how
important
it
was
for
him
to
effect
his
*NL*
purpose
before
we
were
heard
,
mounted
with
the
utmost
quickness
to
where
*NL*
Hadji
Morato
was
,
and
with
him
went
some
of
our
party
;
I
,
however
,
did
*NL*
not
dare
to
leave
Zoraida
,
who
had
fallen
almost
fainting
in
my
arms
.
To
*NL*
be
brief
,
those
who
had
gone
upstairs
acted
so
promptly
that
in
an
*NL*
instant
they
came
down
,
carrying
Hadji
Morato
with
his
hands
bound
and
a
*NL*
napkin
tied
over
his
mouth
,
which
prevented
him
from
uttering
a
word
,
*NL*
warning
him
at
the
same
time
that
to
attempt
to
speak
would
cost
him
his
*NL*
life
.
When
his
daughter
caught
sight
of
him
she
covered
her
eyes
so
as
*NL*
not
to
see
him
,
and
her
father
was
horror-stricken
,
not
knowing
how
*NL*
willingly
she
had
placed
herself
in
our
hands
.
But
it
was
now
most
*NL*
essential
for
us
to
be
on
the
move
,
and
carefully
and
quickly
we
regained
*NL*
the
vessel
,
where
those
who
had
remained
on
board
were
waiting
for
us
in
*NL*
apprehension
of
some
mishap
having
befallen
us
.
It
was
barely
two
hours
*NL*
after
night
set
in
when
we
were
all
on
board
the
vessel
,
where
the
cords
*NL*
were
removed
from
the
hands
of
Zoraida
's
father
,
and
the
napkin
from
his
*NL*
mouth
;
but
the
renegade
once
more
told
him
not
to
utter
a
word
,
or
they
*NL*
would
take
his
life
.
He
,
when
he
saw
his
daughter
there
,
began
to
sigh
*NL*
piteously
,
and
still
more
when
he
perceived
that
I
held
her
closely
*NL*
embraced
and
that
she
lay
quiet
without
resisting
or
complaining
,
or
*NL*
showing
any
reluctance
;
nevertheless
he
remained
silent
lest
they
should
*NL*
carry
into
effect
the
repeated
threats
the
renegade
had
addressed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
herself
now
on
board
,
and
that
we
were
about
to
give
way
with
the
*NL*
oars
,
Zoraida
,
seeing
her
father
there
,
and
the
other
Moors
bound
,
bade
*NL*
the
renegade
ask
me
to
do
her
the
favour
of
releasing
the
Moors
and
*NL*
setting
her
father
at
liberty
,
for
she
would
rather
drown
herself
in
the
*NL*
sea
than
suffer
a
father
that
had
loved
her
so
dearly
to
be
carried
away
*NL*
captive
before
her
eyes
and
on
her
account
.
The
renegade
repeated
this
to
*NL*
me
,
and
I
replied
that
I
was
very
willing
to
do
so
;
but
he
replied
that
*NL*
it
was
not
advisable
,
because
if
they
were
left
there
they
would
at
once
*NL*
raise
the
country
and
stir
up
the
city
,
and
lead
to
the
despatch
of
swift
*NL*
cruisers
in
pursuit
,
and
our
being
taken
,
by
sea
or
land
,
without
any
*NL*
possibility
of
escape
;
and
that
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
set
them
*NL*
free
on
the
first
Christian
ground
we
reached
.
On
this
point
we
all
*NL*
agreed
;
and
Zoraida
,
to
whom
it
was
explained
,
together
with
the
reasons
*NL*
that
prevented
us
from
doing
at
once
what
she
desired
,
was
satisfied
*NL*
likewise
;
and
then
in
glad
silence
and
with
cheerful
alacrity
each
of
our
*NL*
stout
rowers
took
his
oar
,
and
commending
ourselves
to
God
with
all
our
*NL*
hearts
,
we
began
to
shape
our
course
for
the
island
of
Majorca
,
the
*NL*
nearest
Christian
land
.
Owing
,
however
,
to
the
Tramontana
rising
a
*NL*
little
,
and
the
sea
growing
somewhat
rough
,
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
*NL*
keep
a
straight
course
for
Majorca
,
and
we
were
compelled
to
coast
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
Oran
,
not
without
great
uneasiness
on
our
part
lest
we
*NL*
should
be
observed
from
the
town
of
Shershel
,
which
lies
on
that
coast
,
*NL*
not
more
than
sixty
miles
from
Algiers
.
Moreover
we
were
afraid
of
*NL*
meeting
on
that
course
one
of
the
galliots
that
usually
come
with
goods
*NL*
from
Tetuan
;
although
each
of
us
for
himself
and
all
of
us
together
felt
*NL*
confident
that
,
if
we
were
to
meet
a
merchant
galliot
,
so
that
it
were
*NL*
not
a
cruiser
,
not
only
should
we
not
be
lost
,
but
that
we
should
take
a
*NL*
vessel
in
which
we
could
more
safely
accomplish
our
voyage
.
As
we
pursued
*NL*
our
course
Zoraida
kept
her
head
between
my
hands
so
as
not
to
see
her
*NL*
father
,
and
I
felt
that
she
was
praying
to
Lela
Marien
to
help
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
might
have
made
about
thirty
miles
when
daybreak
found
us
some
three
*NL*
musket-shots
off
the
land
,
which
seemed
to
us
deserted
,
and
without
*NL*
anyone
to
see
us
.
For
all
that
,
however
,
by
hard
rowing
we
put
out
a
*NL*
little
to
sea
,
for
it
was
now
somewhat
calmer
,
and
having
gained
about
*NL*
two
leagues
the
word
was
given
to
row
by
batches
,
while
we
ate
something
,
*NL*
for
the
vessel
was
well
provided
;
but
the
rowers
said
it
was
not
a
time
*NL*
to
take
any
rest
;
let
food
be
served
out
to
those
who
were
not
rowing
,
*NL*
but
they
would
not
leave
their
oars
on
any
account
.
This
was
done
,
but
*NL*
now
a
stiff
breeze
began
to
blow
,
which
obliged
us
to
leave
off
rowing
*NL*
and
make
sail
at
once
and
steer
for
Oran
,
as
it
was
impossible
to
make
*NL*
any
other
course
.
All
this
was
done
very
promptly
,
and
under
sail
we
ran
*NL*
more
than
eight
miles
an
hour
without
any
fear
,
except
that
of
coming
*NL*
across
some
vessel
out
on
a
roving
expedition
.
We
gave
the
Moorish
rowers
*NL*
some
food
,
and
the
renegade
comforted
them
by
telling
them
that
they
were
*NL*
not
held
as
captives
,
as
we
should
set
them
free
on
the
first
*NL*
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
was
said
to
Zoraida
's
father
,
who
replied
,
``
Anything
else
,
*NL*
Christian
,
I
might
hope
for
or
think
likely
from
your
generosity
and
good
*NL*
behaviour
,
but
do
not
think
me
so
simple
as
to
imagine
you
will
give
me
*NL*
my
liberty
;
for
you
would
have
never
exposed
yourselves
to
the
danger
of
*NL*
depriving
me
of
it
only
to
restore
it
to
me
so
generously
,
especially
as
*NL*
you
know
who
I
am
and
the
sum
you
may
expect
to
receive
on
restoring
it
;
*NL*
and
if
you
will
only
name
that
,
I
here
offer
you
all
you
require
for
*NL*
myself
and
for
my
unhappy
daughter
there
;
or
else
for
her
alone
,
for
she
*NL*
is
the
greatest
and
most
precious
part
of
my
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
he
began
to
weep
so
bitterly
that
he
filled
us
all
with
*NL*
compassion
and
forced
Zoraida
to
look
at
him
,
and
when
she
saw
him
*NL*
weeping
she
was
so
moved
that
she
rose
from
my
feet
and
ran
to
throw
her
*NL*
arms
round
him
,
and
pressing
her
face
to
his
,
they
both
gave
way
to
such
*NL*
an
outburst
of
tears
that
several
of
us
were
constrained
to
keep
them
*NL*
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
her
father
saw
her
in
full
dress
and
with
all
her
jewels
about
*NL*
her
,
he
said
to
her
in
his
own
language
,
``
What
means
this
,
my
daughter
?
*NL*
Last
night
,
before
this
terrible
misfortune
in
which
we
are
plunged
*NL*
befell
us
,
I
saw
thee
in
thy
everyday
and
indoor
garments
;
and
now
,
*NL*
without
having
had
time
to
attire
thyself
,
and
without
my
bringing
thee
*NL*
any
joyful
tidings
to
furnish
an
occasion
for
adorning
and
bedecking
*NL*
thyself
,
I
see
thee
arrayed
in
the
finest
attire
it
would
be
in
my
power
*NL*
to
give
thee
when
fortune
was
most
kind
to
us
.
Answer
me
this
;
for
it
*NL*
causes
me
greater
anxiety
and
surprise
than
even
this
misfortune
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
renegade
interpreted
to
us
what
the
Moor
said
to
his
daughter
;
she
,
*NL*
however
,
returned
him
no
answer
.
But
when
he
observed
in
one
corner
of
*NL*
the
vessel
the
little
trunk
in
which
she
used
to
keep
her
jewels
,
which
*NL*
he
well
knew
he
had
left
in
Algiers
and
had
not
brought
to
the
garden
,
he
*NL*
was
still
more
amazed
,
and
asked
her
how
that
trunk
had
come
into
our
*NL*
hands
,
and
what
there
was
in
it
.
To
which
the
renegade
,
without
waiting
*NL*
for
Zoraida
to
reply
,
made
answer
,
``
Do
not
trouble
thyself
by
asking
thy
*NL*
daughter
Zoraida
so
many
questions
,
senor
,
for
the
one
answer
I
will
give
*NL*
thee
will
serve
for
all
;
I
would
have
thee
know
that
she
is
a
Christian
,
*NL*
and
that
it
is
she
who
has
been
the
file
for
our
chains
and
our
deliverer
*NL*
from
captivity
.
She
is
here
of
her
own
free
will
,
as
glad
,
I
imagine
,
to
*NL*
find
herself
in
this
position
as
he
who
escapes
from
darkness
into
the
*NL*
light
,
from
death
to
life
,
and
from
suffering
to
glory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daughter
,
is
this
true
,
what
he
says
?
''
cried
the
Moor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
''
replied
Zoraida
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
thou
art
in
truth
a
Christian
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
and
that
thou
*NL*
hast
given
thy
father
into
the
power
of
his
enemies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Zoraida
made
answer
,
``
A
Christian
I
am
,
but
it
is
not
I
who
have
*NL*
placed
thee
in
this
position
,
for
it
never
was
my
wish
to
leave
thee
or
*NL*
do
thee
harm
,
but
only
to
do
good
to
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
good
hast
thou
done
thyself
,
daughter
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
thou
that
,
''
said
she
,
``
of
Lela
Marien
,
for
she
can
tell
thee
better
*NL*
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Moor
had
hardly
heard
these
words
when
with
marvellous
quickness
he
*NL*
flung
himself
headforemost
into
the
sea
,
where
no
doubt
he
would
have
*NL*
been
drowned
had
not
the
long
and
full
dress
he
wore
held
him
up
for
a
*NL*
little
on
the
surface
of
the
water
.
Zoraida
cried
aloud
to
us
to
save
*NL*
him
,
and
we
all
hastened
to
help
,
and
seizing
him
by
his
robe
we
drew
him
*NL*
in
half
drowned
and
insensible
,
at
which
Zoraida
was
in
such
distress
*NL*
that
she
wept
over
him
as
piteously
and
bitterly
as
though
he
were
*NL*
already
dead
.
We
turned
him
upon
his
face
and
he
voided
a
great
quantity
*NL*
of
water
,
and
at
the
end
of
two
hours
came
to
himself
.
Meanwhile
,
the
*NL*
wind
having
changed
we
were
compelled
to
head
for
the
land
,
and
ply
our
*NL*
oars
to
avoid
being
driven
on
shore
;
but
it
was
our
good
fortune
to
reach
*NL*
a
creek
that
lies
on
one
side
of
a
small
promontory
or
cape
,
called
by
*NL*
the
Moors
that
of
the
``
Cava
rumia
,
''
which
in
our
language
means
``
the
*NL*
wicked
Christian
woman
;
''
for
it
is
a
tradition
among
them
that
La
Cava
,
*NL*
through
whom
Spain
was
lost
,
lies
buried
at
that
spot
;
``
cava
''
in
their
*NL*
language
meaning
``
wicked
woman
,
''
and
``
rumia
''
``
Christian
;
''
moreover
,
they
*NL*
count
it
unlucky
to
anchor
there
when
necessity
compels
them
,
and
they
*NL*
never
do
so
otherwise
.
For
us
,
however
,
it
was
not
the
resting-place
of
*NL*
the
wicked
woman
but
a
haven
of
safety
for
our
relief
,
so
much
had
the
*NL*
sea
now
got
up
.
We
posted
a
look-out
on
shore
,
and
never
let
the
oars
out
*NL*
of
our
hands
,
and
ate
of
the
stores
the
renegade
had
laid
in
,
imploring
*NL*
God
and
Our
Lady
with
all
our
hearts
to
help
and
protect
us
,
that
we
*NL*
might
give
a
happy
ending
to
a
beginning
so
prosperous
.
At
the
entreaty
*NL*
of
Zoraida
orders
were
given
to
set
on
shore
her
father
and
the
other
*NL*
Moors
who
were
still
bound
,
for
she
could
not
endure
,
nor
could
her
*NL*
tender
heart
bear
to
see
her
father
in
bonds
and
her
fellow-countrymen
*NL*
prisoners
before
her
eyes
.
We
promised
her
to
do
this
at
the
moment
of
*NL*
departure
,
for
as
it
was
uninhabited
we
ran
no
risk
in
releasing
them
at
*NL*
that
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
prayers
were
not
so
far
in
vain
as
to
be
unheard
by
Heaven
,
for
after
*NL*
a
while
the
wind
changed
in
our
favour
,
and
made
the
sea
calm
,
inviting
*NL*
us
once
more
to
resume
our
voyage
with
a
good
heart
.
Seeing
this
we
*NL*
unbound
the
Moors
,
and
one
by
one
put
them
on
shore
,
at
which
they
were
*NL*
filled
with
amazement
;
but
when
we
came
to
land
Zoraida
's
father
,
who
had
*NL*
now
completely
recovered
his
senses
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
,
think
ye
,
Christians
,
that
this
wicked
woman
is
rejoiced
at
*NL*
your
giving
me
my
liberty
?
Think
ye
it
is
because
of
the
affection
she
*NL*
bears
me
?
Nay
verily
,
it
is
only
because
of
the
hindrance
my
presence
*NL*
offers
to
the
execution
of
her
base
designs
.
And
think
not
that
it
is
her
*NL*
belief
that
yours
is
better
than
ours
that
has
led
her
to
change
her
*NL*
religion
;
it
is
only
because
she
knows
that
immodesty
is
more
freely
*NL*
practised
in
your
country
than
in
ours
.
''
Then
turning
to
Zoraida
,
while
I
*NL*
and
another
of
the
Christians
held
him
fast
by
both
arms
,
lest
he
should
*NL*
do
some
mad
act
,
he
said
to
her
,
``
Infamous
girl
,
misguided
maiden
,
*NL*
whither
in
thy
blindness
and
madness
art
thou
going
in
the
hands
of
these
*NL*
dogs
,
our
natural
enemies
?
Cursed
be
the
hour
when
I
begot
thee
!
Cursed
*NL*
the
luxury
and
indulgence
in
which
I
reared
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
seeing
that
he
was
not
likely
soon
to
cease
I
made
haste
to
put
him
*NL*
on
shore
,
and
thence
he
continued
his
maledictions
and
lamentations
*NL*
aloud
;
calling
on
Mohammed
to
pray
to
Allah
to
destroy
us
,
to
confound
*NL*
us
,
to
make
an
end
of
us
;
and
when
,
in
consequence
of
having
made
sail
,
*NL*
we
could
no
longer
hear
what
he
said
we
could
see
what
he
did
;
how
he
*NL*
plucked
out
his
beard
and
tore
his
hair
and
lay
writhing
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
But
once
he
raised
his
voice
to
such
a
pitch
that
we
were
able
to
hear
*NL*
what
he
said
.
``
Come
back
,
dear
daughter
,
come
back
to
shore
;
I
forgive
*NL*
thee
all
;
let
those
men
have
the
money
,
for
it
is
theirs
now
,
and
come
*NL*
back
to
comfort
thy
sorrowing
father
,
who
will
yield
up
his
life
on
this
*NL*
barren
strand
if
thou
dost
leave
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
Zoraida
heard
,
and
heard
with
sorrow
and
tears
,
and
all
she
*NL*
could
say
in
answer
was
,
``
Allah
grant
that
Lela
Marien
,
who
has
made
me
*NL*
become
a
Christian
,
give
thee
comfort
in
thy
sorrow
,
my
father
.
Allah
*NL*
knows
that
I
could
not
do
otherwise
than
I
have
done
,
and
that
these
*NL*
Christians
owe
nothing
to
my
will
;
for
even
had
I
wished
not
to
accompany
*NL*
them
,
but
remain
at
home
,
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
,
so
*NL*
eagerly
did
my
soul
urge
me
on
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
purpose
,
*NL*
which
I
feel
to
be
as
righteous
as
to
thee
,
dear
father
,
it
seems
*NL*
wicked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
neither
could
her
father
hear
her
nor
we
see
him
when
she
said
this
;
*NL*
and
so
,
while
I
consoled
Zoraida
,
we
turned
our
attention
to
our
voyage
,
*NL*
in
which
a
breeze
from
the
right
point
so
favoured
us
that
we
made
sure
*NL*
of
finding
ourselves
off
the
coast
of
Spain
on
the
morrow
by
daybreak
.
*NL*
But
,
as
good
seldom
or
never
comes
pure
and
unmixed
,
without
being
*NL*
attended
or
followed
by
some
disturbing
evil
that
gives
a
shock
to
it
,
*NL*
our
fortune
,
or
perhaps
the
curses
which
the
Moor
had
hurled
at
his
*NL*
daughter
-LRB-
for
whatever
kind
of
father
they
may
come
from
these
are
always
*NL*
to
be
dreaded
-RRB-
,
brought
it
about
that
when
we
were
now
in
mid-sea
,
and
*NL*
the
night
about
three
hours
spent
,
as
we
were
running
with
all
sail
set
*NL*
and
oars
lashed
,
for
the
favouring
breeze
saved
us
the
trouble
of
using
*NL*
them
,
we
saw
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
which
shone
brilliantly
,
a
*NL*
square-rigged
vessel
in
full
sail
close
to
us
,
luffing
up
and
standing
*NL*
across
our
course
,
and
so
close
that
we
had
to
strike
sail
to
avoid
*NL*
running
foul
of
her
,
while
they
too
put
the
helm
hard
up
to
let
us
pass
.
*NL*
They
came
to
the
side
of
the
ship
to
ask
who
we
were
,
whither
we
were
*NL*
bound
,
and
whence
we
came
,
but
as
they
asked
this
in
French
our
renegade
*NL*
said
,
``
Let
no
one
answer
,
for
no
doubt
these
are
French
corsairs
who
*NL*
plunder
all
comers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Acting
on
this
warning
no
one
answered
a
word
,
but
after
we
had
gone
a
*NL*
little
ahead
,
and
the
vessel
was
now
lying
to
leeward
,
suddenly
they
*NL*
fired
two
guns
,
and
apparently
both
loaded
with
chain-shot
,
for
with
one
*NL*
they
cut
our
mast
in
half
and
brought
down
both
it
and
the
sail
into
the
*NL*
sea
,
and
the
other
,
discharged
at
the
same
moment
,
sent
a
ball
into
our
*NL*
vessel
amidships
,
staving
her
in
completely
,
but
without
doing
any
*NL*
further
damage
.
We
,
however
,
finding
ourselves
sinking
began
to
shout
for
*NL*
help
and
call
upon
those
in
the
ship
to
pick
us
up
as
we
were
beginning
*NL*
to
fill
.
They
then
lay
to
,
and
lowering
a
skiff
or
boat
,
as
many
as
a
*NL*
dozen
Frenchmen
,
well
armed
with
match-locks
,
and
their
matches
burning
,
*NL*
got
into
it
and
came
alongside
;
and
seeing
how
few
we
were
,
and
that
our
*NL*
vessel
was
going
down
,
they
took
us
in
,
telling
us
that
this
had
come
to
*NL*
us
through
our
incivility
in
not
giving
them
an
answer
.
Our
renegade
took
*NL*
the
trunk
containing
Zoraida
's
wealth
and
dropped
it
into
the
sea
without
*NL*
anyone
perceiving
what
he
did
.
In
short
we
went
on
board
with
the
*NL*
Frenchmen
,
who
,
after
having
ascertained
all
they
wanted
to
know
about
*NL*
us
,
rifled
us
of
everything
we
had
,
as
if
they
had
been
our
bitterest
*NL*
enemies
,
and
from
Zoraida
they
took
even
the
anklets
she
wore
on
her
*NL*
feet
;
but
the
distress
they
caused
her
did
not
distress
me
so
much
as
the
*NL*
fear
I
was
in
that
from
robbing
her
of
her
rich
and
precious
jewels
they
*NL*
would
proceed
to
rob
her
of
the
most
precious
jewel
that
she
valued
more
*NL*
than
all
.
The
desires
,
however
,
of
those
people
do
not
go
beyond
money
,
*NL*
but
of
that
their
covetousness
is
insatiable
,
and
on
this
occasion
it
was
*NL*
carried
to
such
a
pitch
that
they
would
have
taken
even
the
clothes
we
*NL*
wore
as
captives
if
they
had
been
worth
anything
to
them
.
It
was
the
*NL*
advice
of
some
of
them
to
throw
us
all
into
the
sea
wrapped
up
in
a
sail
;
*NL*
for
their
purpose
was
to
trade
at
some
of
the
ports
of
Spain
,
giving
*NL*
themselves
out
as
Bretons
,
and
if
they
brought
us
alive
they
would
be
*NL*
punished
as
soon
as
the
robbery
was
discovered
;
but
the
captain
-LRB-
who
was
*NL*
the
one
who
had
plundered
my
beloved
Zoraida
-RRB-
said
he
was
satisfied
with
*NL*
the
prize
he
had
got
,
and
that
he
would
not
touch
at
any
Spanish
port
,
*NL*
but
pass
the
Straits
of
Gibraltar
by
night
,
or
as
best
he
could
,
and
make
*NL*
for
La
Rochelle
,
from
which
he
had
sailed
.
So
they
agreed
by
common
*NL*
consent
to
give
us
the
skiff
belonging
to
their
ship
and
all
we
required
*NL*
for
the
short
voyage
that
remained
to
us
,
and
this
they
did
the
next
day
*NL*
on
coming
in
sight
of
the
Spanish
coast
,
with
which
,
and
the
joy
we
felt
,
*NL*
all
our
sufferings
and
miseries
were
as
completely
forgotten
as
if
they
*NL*
had
never
been
endured
by
us
,
such
is
the
delight
of
recovering
lost
*NL*
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
have
been
about
mid-day
when
they
placed
us
in
the
boat
,
giving
us
*NL*
two
kegs
of
water
and
some
biscuit
;
and
the
captain
,
moved
by
I
know
not
*NL*
what
compassion
,
as
the
lovely
Zoraida
was
about
to
embark
,
gave
her
some
*NL*
forty
gold
crowns
,
and
would
not
permit
his
men
to
take
from
her
those
*NL*
same
garments
which
she
has
on
now
.
We
got
into
the
boat
,
returning
them
*NL*
thanks
for
their
kindness
to
us
,
and
showing
ourselves
grateful
rather
*NL*
than
indignant
.
They
stood
out
to
sea
,
steering
for
the
straits
;
we
,
*NL*
without
looking
to
any
compass
save
the
land
we
had
before
us
,
set
*NL*
ourselves
to
row
with
such
energy
that
by
sunset
we
were
so
near
that
we
*NL*
might
easily
,
we
thought
,
land
before
the
night
was
far
advanced
.
But
as
*NL*
the
moon
did
not
show
that
night
,
and
the
sky
was
clouded
,
and
as
we
knew
*NL*
not
whereabouts
we
were
,
it
did
not
seem
to
us
a
prudent
thing
to
make
*NL*
for
the
shore
,
as
several
of
us
advised
,
saying
we
ought
to
run
ourselves
*NL*
ashore
even
if
it
were
on
rocks
and
far
from
any
habitation
,
for
in
this
*NL*
way
we
should
be
relieved
from
the
apprehensions
we
naturally
felt
of
the
*NL*
prowling
vessels
of
the
Tetuan
corsairs
,
who
leave
Barbary
at
nightfall
*NL*
and
are
on
the
Spanish
coast
by
daybreak
,
where
they
commonly
take
some
*NL*
prize
,
and
then
go
home
to
sleep
in
their
own
houses
.
But
of
the
*NL*
conflicting
counsels
the
one
which
was
adopted
was
that
we
should
*NL*
approach
gradually
,
and
land
where
we
could
if
the
sea
were
calm
enough
*NL*
to
permit
us
.
This
was
done
,
and
a
little
before
midnight
we
drew
near
to
*NL*
the
foot
of
a
huge
and
lofty
mountain
,
not
so
close
to
the
sea
but
that
*NL*
it
left
a
narrow
space
on
which
to
land
conveniently
.
We
ran
our
boat
up
*NL*
on
the
sand
,
and
all
sprang
out
and
kissed
the
ground
,
and
with
tears
of
*NL*
joyful
satisfaction
returned
thanks
to
God
our
Lord
for
all
his
*NL*
incomparable
goodness
to
us
on
our
voyage
.
We
took
out
of
the
boat
the
*NL*
provisions
it
contained
,
and
drew
it
up
on
the
shore
,
and
then
climbed
a
*NL*
long
way
up
the
mountain
,
for
even
there
we
could
not
feel
easy
in
our
*NL*
hearts
,
or
persuade
ourselves
that
it
was
Christian
soil
that
was
now
*NL*
under
our
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dawn
came
,
more
slowly
,
I
think
,
than
we
could
have
wished
;
we
*NL*
completed
the
ascent
in
order
to
see
if
from
the
summit
any
habitation
or
*NL*
any
shepherds
'
huts
could
be
discovered
,
but
strain
our
eyes
as
we
might
,
*NL*
neither
dwelling
,
nor
human
being
,
nor
path
nor
road
could
we
perceive
.
*NL*
However
,
we
determined
to
push
on
farther
,
as
it
could
not
but
be
that
*NL*
ere
long
we
must
see
some
one
who
could
tell
us
where
we
were
.
But
what
*NL*
distressed
me
most
was
to
see
Zoraida
going
on
foot
over
that
rough
*NL*
ground
;
for
though
I
once
carried
her
on
my
shoulders
,
she
was
more
*NL*
wearied
by
my
weariness
than
rested
by
the
rest
;
and
so
she
would
never
*NL*
again
allow
me
to
undergo
the
exertion
,
and
went
on
very
patiently
and
*NL*
cheerfully
,
while
I
led
her
by
the
hand
.
We
had
gone
rather
less
than
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
league
when
the
sound
of
a
little
bell
fell
on
our
ears
,
a
*NL*
clear
proof
that
there
were
flocks
hard
by
,
and
looking
about
carefully
*NL*
to
see
if
any
were
within
view
,
we
observed
a
young
shepherd
tranquilly
*NL*
and
unsuspiciously
trimming
a
stick
with
his
knife
at
the
foot
of
a
cork
*NL*
tree
.
We
called
to
him
,
and
he
,
raising
his
head
,
sprang
nimbly
to
his
*NL*
feet
,
for
,
as
we
afterwards
learned
,
the
first
who
presented
themselves
*NL*
to
his
sight
were
the
renegade
and
Zoraida
,
and
seeing
them
in
Moorish
*NL*
dress
he
imagined
that
all
the
Moors
of
Barbary
were
upon
him
;
and
*NL*
plunging
with
marvellous
swiftness
into
the
thicket
in
front
of
him
,
he
*NL*
began
to
raise
a
prodigious
outcry
,
exclaiming
,
``
The
Moors
--
the
Moors
*NL*
have
landed
!
To
arms
,
to
arms
!
''
We
were
all
thrown
into
perplexity
by
*NL*
these
cries
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
;
but
reflecting
that
the
shouts
of
*NL*
the
shepherd
would
raise
the
country
and
that
the
mounted
coast-guard
*NL*
would
come
at
once
to
see
what
was
the
matter
,
we
agreed
that
the
*NL*
renegade
must
strip
off
his
Turkish
garments
and
put
on
a
captive
's
*NL*
jacket
or
coat
which
one
of
our
party
gave
him
at
once
,
though
he
himself
*NL*
was
reduced
to
his
shirt
;
and
so
commending
ourselves
to
God
,
we
followed
*NL*
the
same
road
which
we
saw
the
shepherd
take
,
expecting
every
moment
that
*NL*
the
coast-guard
would
be
down
upon
us
.
Nor
did
our
expectation
deceive
*NL*
us
,
for
two
hours
had
not
passed
when
,
coming
out
of
the
brushwood
into
*NL*
the
open
ground
,
we
perceived
some
fifty
mounted
men
swiftly
approaching
*NL*
us
at
a
hand-gallop
.
As
soon
as
we
saw
them
we
stood
still
,
waiting
for
*NL*
them
;
but
as
they
came
close
and
,
instead
of
the
Moors
they
were
in
quest
*NL*
of
,
saw
a
set
of
poor
Christians
,
they
were
taken
aback
,
and
one
of
them
*NL*
asked
if
it
could
be
we
who
were
the
cause
of
the
shepherd
having
raised
*NL*
the
call
to
arms
.
I
said
``
Yes
,
''
and
as
I
was
about
to
explain
to
him
what
*NL*
had
occurred
,
and
whence
we
came
and
who
we
were
,
one
of
the
Christians
*NL*
of
our
party
recognised
the
horseman
who
had
put
the
question
to
us
,
and
*NL*
before
I
could
say
anything
more
he
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
be
to
God
,
sirs
,
for
bringing
us
to
such
good
quarters
;
for
,
if
I
*NL*
do
not
deceive
myself
,
the
ground
we
stand
on
is
that
of
Velez
Malaga
*NL*
unless
,
indeed
,
all
my
years
of
captivity
have
made
me
unable
to
*NL*
recollect
that
you
,
senor
,
who
ask
who
we
are
,
are
Pedro
de
Bustamante
,
*NL*
my
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Christian
captive
had
hardly
uttered
these
words
,
when
the
horseman
*NL*
threw
himself
off
his
horse
,
and
ran
to
embrace
the
young
man
,
crying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nephew
of
my
soul
and
life
!
I
recognise
thee
now
;
and
long
have
I
*NL*
mourned
thee
as
dead
,
I
,
and
my
sister
,
thy
mother
,
and
all
thy
kin
that
*NL*
are
still
alive
,
and
whom
God
has
been
pleased
to
preserve
that
they
may
*NL*
enjoy
the
happiness
of
seeing
thee
.
We
knew
long
since
that
thou
wert
in
*NL*
Algiers
,
and
from
the
appearance
of
thy
garments
and
those
of
all
this
*NL*
company
,
I
conclude
that
ye
have
had
a
miraculous
restoration
to
*NL*
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
``
and
by-and-by
we
will
tell
you
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
horsemen
understood
that
we
were
Christian
captives
,
they
*NL*
dismounted
from
their
horses
,
and
each
offered
his
to
carry
us
to
the
*NL*
city
of
Velez
Malaga
,
which
was
a
league
and
a
half
distant
.
Some
of
them
*NL*
went
to
bring
the
boat
to
the
city
,
we
having
told
them
where
we
had
left
*NL*
it
;
others
took
us
up
behind
them
,
and
Zoraida
was
placed
on
the
horse
of
*NL*
the
young
man
's
uncle
.
The
whole
town
came
out
to
meet
us
,
for
they
had
*NL*
by
this
time
heard
of
our
arrival
from
one
who
had
gone
on
in
advance
.
*NL*
They
were
not
astonished
to
see
liberated
captives
or
captive
Moors
,
for
*NL*
people
on
that
coast
are
well
used
to
see
both
one
and
the
other
;
but
*NL*
they
were
astonished
at
the
beauty
of
Zoraida
,
which
was
just
then
*NL*
heightened
,
as
well
by
the
exertion
of
travelling
as
by
joy
at
finding
*NL*
herself
on
Christian
soil
,
and
relieved
of
all
fear
of
being
lost
;
for
*NL*
this
had
brought
such
a
glow
upon
her
face
,
that
unless
my
affection
for
*NL*
her
were
deceiving
me
,
I
would
venture
to
say
that
there
was
not
a
more
*NL*
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
--
at
least
,
that
I
had
ever
seen
.
We
went
*NL*
straight
to
the
church
to
return
thanks
to
God
for
the
mercies
we
had
*NL*
received
,
and
when
Zoraida
entered
it
she
said
there
were
faces
there
*NL*
like
Lela
Marien
's
.
We
told
her
they
were
her
images
;
and
as
well
as
he
*NL*
could
the
renegade
explained
to
her
what
they
meant
,
that
she
might
adore
*NL*
them
as
if
each
of
them
were
the
very
same
Lela
Marien
that
had
spoken
to
*NL*
her
;
and
she
,
having
great
intelligence
and
a
quick
and
clear
instinct
,
*NL*
understood
at
once
all
he
said
to
her
about
them
.
Thence
they
took
us
*NL*
away
and
distributed
us
all
in
different
houses
in
the
town
;
but
as
for
*NL*
the
renegade
,
Zoraida
,
and
myself
,
the
Christian
who
came
with
us
brought
*NL*
us
to
the
house
of
his
parents
,
who
had
a
fair
share
of
the
gifts
of
*NL*
fortune
,
and
treated
us
with
as
much
kindness
as
they
did
their
own
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
remained
six
days
in
Velez
,
at
the
end
of
which
the
renegade
,
having
*NL*
informed
himself
of
all
that
was
requisite
for
him
to
do
,
set
out
for
the
*NL*
city
of
Granada
to
restore
himself
to
the
sacred
bosom
of
the
Church
*NL*
through
the
medium
of
the
Holy
Inquisition
.
The
other
released
captives
*NL*
took
their
departures
,
each
the
way
that
seemed
best
to
him
,
and
Zoraida
*NL*
and
I
were
left
alone
,
with
nothing
more
than
the
crowns
which
the
*NL*
courtesy
of
the
Frenchman
had
bestowed
upon
Zoraida
,
out
of
which
I
*NL*
bought
the
beast
on
which
she
rides
;
and
,
I
for
the
present
attending
her
*NL*
as
her
father
and
squire
and
not
as
her
husband
,
we
are
now
going
to
*NL*
ascertain
if
my
father
is
living
,
or
if
any
of
my
brothers
has
had
better
*NL*
fortune
than
mine
has
been
;
though
,
as
Heaven
has
made
me
the
companion
*NL*
of
Zoraida
,
I
think
no
other
lot
could
be
assigned
to
me
,
however
happy
,
*NL*
that
I
would
rather
have
.
The
patience
with
which
she
endures
the
*NL*
hardships
that
poverty
brings
with
it
,
and
the
eagerness
she
shows
to
*NL*
become
a
Christian
,
are
such
that
they
fill
me
with
admiration
,
and
bind
*NL*
me
to
serve
her
all
my
life
;
though
the
happiness
I
feel
in
seeing
myself
*NL*
hers
,
and
her
mine
,
is
disturbed
and
marred
by
not
knowing
whether
I
*NL*
shall
find
any
corner
to
shelter
her
in
my
own
country
,
or
whether
time
*NL*
and
death
may
not
have
made
such
changes
in
the
fortunes
and
lives
of
my
*NL*
father
and
brothers
,
that
I
shall
hardly
find
anyone
who
knows
me
,
if
*NL*
they
are
not
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
no
more
of
my
story
to
tell
you
,
gentlemen
;
whether
it
be
an
*NL*
interesting
or
a
curious
one
let
your
better
judgments
decide
;
all
I
can
*NL*
say
is
I
would
gladly
have
told
it
to
you
more
briefly
;
although
my
fear
*NL*
of
wearying
you
has
made
me
leave
out
more
than
one
circumstance
.

CHAPTER
XLII
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
WHAT
FURTHER
TOOK
PLACE
IN
THE
INN
,
AND
OF
SEVERAL
OTHER
*NL*
THINGS
WORTH
KNOWING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
the
captive
held
his
peace
,
and
Don
Fernando
said
to
*NL*
him
,
``
In
truth
,
captain
,
the
manner
in
which
you
have
related
this
*NL*
remarkable
adventure
has
been
such
as
befitted
the
novelty
and
*NL*
strangeness
of
the
matter
.
The
whole
story
is
curious
and
uncommon
,
and
*NL*
abounds
with
incidents
that
fill
the
hearers
with
wonder
and
*NL*
astonishment
;
and
so
great
is
the
pleasure
we
have
found
in
listening
to
*NL*
it
that
we
should
be
glad
if
it
were
to
begin
again
,
even
though
*NL*
to-morrow
were
to
find
us
still
occupied
with
the
same
tale
.
''
And
while
*NL*
he
said
this
Cardenio
and
the
rest
of
them
offered
to
be
of
service
to
*NL*
him
in
any
way
that
lay
in
their
power
,
and
in
words
and
language
so
*NL*
kindly
and
sincere
that
the
captain
was
much
gratified
by
their
*NL*
good-will
.
In
particular
Don
Fernando
offered
,
if
he
would
go
back
with
*NL*
him
,
to
get
his
brother
the
marquis
to
become
godfather
at
the
baptism
of
*NL*
Zoraida
,
and
on
his
own
part
to
provide
him
with
the
means
of
making
his
*NL*
appearance
in
his
own
country
with
the
credit
and
comfort
he
was
entitled
*NL*
to
.
For
all
this
the
captive
returned
thanks
very
courteously
,
although
*NL*
he
would
not
accept
any
of
their
generous
offers
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
night
closed
in
,
and
as
it
did
,
there
came
up
to
the
inn
a
*NL*
coach
attended
by
some
men
on
horseback
,
who
demanded
accommodation
;
to
*NL*
which
the
landlady
replied
that
there
was
not
a
hand
's
breadth
of
the
*NL*
whole
inn
unoccupied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
for
all
that
,
''
said
one
of
those
who
had
entered
on
horseback
,
*NL*
``
room
must
be
found
for
his
lordship
the
Judge
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
name
the
landlady
was
taken
aback
,
and
said
,
``
Senor
,
the
fact
is
*NL*
I
have
no
beds
;
but
if
his
lordship
the
Judge
carries
one
with
him
,
as
no
*NL*
doubt
he
does
,
let
him
come
in
and
welcome
;
for
my
husband
and
I
will
*NL*
give
up
our
room
to
accommodate
his
worship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
so
be
it
,
''
said
the
squire
;
but
in
the
meantime
a
man
had
got
*NL*
out
of
the
coach
whose
dress
indicated
at
a
glance
the
office
and
post
he
*NL*
held
,
for
the
long
robe
with
ruffled
sleeves
that
he
wore
showed
that
he
*NL*
was
,
as
his
servant
said
,
a
Judge
of
appeal
.
He
led
by
the
hand
a
young
*NL*
girl
in
a
travelling
dress
,
apparently
about
sixteen
years
of
age
,
and
of
*NL*
such
a
high-bred
air
,
so
beautiful
and
so
graceful
,
that
all
were
filled
*NL*
with
admiration
when
she
made
her
appearance
,
and
but
for
having
seen
*NL*
Dorothea
,
Luscinda
,
and
Zoraida
,
who
were
there
in
the
inn
,
they
would
*NL*
have
fancied
that
a
beauty
like
that
of
this
maiden
's
would
have
been
*NL*
hard
to
find
.
Don
Quixote
was
present
at
the
entrance
of
the
Judge
with
*NL*
the
young
lady
,
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
he
said
,
``
Your
worship
may
with
*NL*
confidence
enter
and
take
your
ease
in
this
castle
;
for
though
the
*NL*
accommodation
be
scanty
and
poor
,
there
are
no
quarters
so
cramped
or
*NL*
inconvenient
that
they
can
not
make
room
for
arms
and
letters
;
above
all
*NL*
if
arms
and
letters
have
beauty
for
a
guide
and
leader
,
as
letters
*NL*
represented
by
your
worship
have
in
this
fair
maiden
,
to
whom
not
only
*NL*
ought
castles
to
throw
themselves
open
and
yield
themselves
up
,
but
rocks
*NL*
should
rend
themselves
asunder
and
mountains
divide
and
bow
themselves
*NL*
down
to
give
her
a
reception
.
Enter
,
your
worship
,
I
say
,
into
this
*NL*
paradise
,
for
here
you
will
find
stars
and
suns
to
accompany
the
heaven
*NL*
your
worship
brings
with
you
,
here
you
will
find
arms
in
their
supreme
*NL*
excellence
,
and
beauty
in
its
highest
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Judge
was
struck
with
amazement
at
the
language
of
Don
Quixote
,
whom
*NL*
he
scrutinized
very
carefully
,
no
less
astonished
by
his
figure
than
by
*NL*
his
talk
;
and
before
he
could
find
words
to
answer
him
he
had
a
fresh
*NL*
surprise
,
when
he
saw
opposite
to
him
Luscinda
,
Dorothea
,
and
Zoraida
,
*NL*
who
,
having
heard
of
the
new
guests
and
of
the
beauty
of
the
young
lady
,
*NL*
had
come
to
see
her
and
welcome
her
;
Don
Fernando
,
Cardenio
,
and
the
*NL*
curate
,
however
,
greeted
him
in
a
more
intelligible
and
polished
style
.
*NL*
In
short
,
the
Judge
made
his
entrance
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
,
as
well
*NL*
with
what
he
saw
as
what
he
heard
,
and
the
fair
ladies
of
the
inn
gave
*NL*
the
fair
damsel
a
cordial
welcome
.
On
the
whole
he
could
perceive
that
*NL*
all
who
were
there
were
people
of
quality
;
but
with
the
figure
,
*NL*
countenance
,
and
bearing
of
Don
Quixote
he
was
at
his
wits
'
end
;
and
all
*NL*
civilities
having
been
exchanged
,
and
the
accommodation
of
the
inn
*NL*
inquired
into
,
it
was
settled
,
as
it
had
been
before
settled
,
that
all
*NL*
the
women
should
retire
to
the
garret
that
has
been
already
mentioned
,
*NL*
and
that
the
men
should
remain
outside
as
if
to
guard
them
;
the
Judge
,
*NL*
therefore
,
was
very
well
pleased
to
allow
his
daughter
,
for
such
the
*NL*
damsel
was
,
to
go
with
the
ladies
,
which
she
did
very
willingly
;
and
with
*NL*
part
of
the
host
's
narrow
bed
and
half
of
what
the
Judge
had
brought
with
*NL*
him
,
they
made
a
more
comfortable
arrangement
for
the
night
than
they
had
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captive
,
whose
heart
had
leaped
within
him
the
instant
he
saw
the
*NL*
Judge
,
telling
him
somehow
that
this
was
his
brother
,
asked
one
of
the
*NL*
servants
who
accompanied
him
what
his
name
was
,
and
whether
he
knew
from
*NL*
what
part
of
the
country
he
came
.
The
servant
replied
that
he
was
called
*NL*
the
Licentiate
Juan
Perez
de
Viedma
,
and
that
he
had
heard
it
said
he
*NL*
came
from
a
village
in
the
mountains
of
Leon
.
From
this
statement
,
and
*NL*
what
he
himself
had
seen
,
he
felt
convinced
that
this
was
his
brother
who
*NL*
had
adopted
letters
by
his
father
's
advice
;
and
excited
and
rejoiced
,
he
*NL*
called
Don
Fernando
and
Cardenio
and
the
curate
aside
,
and
told
them
how
*NL*
the
matter
stood
,
assuring
them
that
the
judge
was
his
brother
.
The
*NL*
servant
had
further
informed
him
that
he
was
now
going
to
the
Indies
with
*NL*
the
appointment
of
Judge
of
the
Supreme
Court
of
Mexico
;
and
he
had
*NL*
learned
,
likewise
,
that
the
young
lady
was
his
daughter
,
whose
mother
had
*NL*
died
in
giving
birth
to
her
,
and
that
he
was
very
rich
in
consequence
of
*NL*
the
dowry
left
to
him
with
the
daughter
.
He
asked
their
advice
as
to
what
*NL*
means
he
should
adopt
to
make
himself
known
,
or
to
ascertain
beforehand
*NL*
whether
,
when
he
had
made
himself
known
,
his
brother
,
seeing
him
so
poor
,
*NL*
would
be
ashamed
of
him
,
or
would
receive
him
with
a
warm
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it
to
me
to
find
out
that
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
though
there
is
no
*NL*
reason
for
supposing
,
senor
captain
,
that
you
will
not
be
kindly
*NL*
received
,
because
the
worth
and
wisdom
that
your
brother
's
bearing
shows
*NL*
him
to
possess
do
not
make
it
likely
that
he
will
prove
haughty
or
*NL*
insensible
,
or
that
he
will
not
know
how
to
estimate
the
accidents
of
*NL*
fortune
at
their
proper
value
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
I
would
not
make
myself
known
abruptly
,
but
*NL*
in
some
indirect
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
already
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
that
I
will
manage
it
in
a
*NL*
way
to
satisfy
us
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
supper
was
ready
,
and
they
all
took
their
seats
at
the
*NL*
table
,
except
the
captive
,
and
the
ladies
,
who
supped
by
themselves
in
*NL*
their
own
room
.
In
the
middle
of
supper
the
curate
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
comrade
of
your
worship
's
name
,
Senor
Judge
,
in
Constantinople
,
*NL*
where
I
was
a
captive
for
several
years
,
and
that
same
comrade
was
one
of
*NL*
the
stoutest
soldiers
and
captains
in
the
whole
Spanish
infantry
;
but
he
*NL*
had
as
large
a
share
of
misfortune
as
he
had
of
gallantry
and
courage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
was
the
captain
called
,
senor
?
''
asked
the
Judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
called
Ruy
Perez
de
Viedma
,
''
replied
the
curate
,
``
and
he
was
born
*NL*
in
a
village
in
the
mountains
of
Leon
;
and
he
mentioned
a
circumstance
*NL*
connected
with
his
father
and
his
brothers
which
,
had
it
not
been
told
me
*NL*
by
so
truthful
a
man
as
he
was
,
I
should
have
set
down
as
one
of
those
*NL*
fables
the
old
women
tell
over
the
fire
in
winter
;
for
he
said
his
father
*NL*
had
divided
his
property
among
his
three
sons
and
had
addressed
words
of
*NL*
advice
to
them
sounder
than
any
of
Cato
's
.
But
I
can
say
this
much
,
that
*NL*
the
choice
he
made
of
going
to
the
wars
was
attended
with
such
success
,
*NL*
that
by
his
gallant
conduct
and
courage
,
and
without
any
help
save
his
*NL*
own
merit
,
he
rose
in
a
few
years
to
be
captain
of
infantry
,
and
to
see
*NL*
himself
on
the
high-road
and
in
position
to
be
given
the
command
of
a
*NL*
corps
before
long
;
but
Fortune
was
against
him
,
for
where
he
might
have
*NL*
expected
her
favour
he
lost
it
,
and
with
it
his
liberty
,
on
that
glorious
*NL*
day
when
so
many
recovered
theirs
,
at
the
battle
of
Lepanto
.
I
lost
mine
*NL*
at
the
Goletta
,
and
after
a
variety
of
adventures
we
found
ourselves
*NL*
comrades
at
Constantinople
.
Thence
he
went
to
Algiers
,
where
he
met
with
*NL*
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
adventures
that
ever
befell
anyone
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
curate
went
on
to
relate
briefly
his
brother
's
adventure
with
*NL*
Zoraida
;
to
all
which
the
Judge
gave
such
an
attentive
hearing
that
he
*NL*
never
before
had
been
so
much
of
a
hearer
.
The
curate
,
however
,
only
went
*NL*
so
far
as
to
describe
how
the
Frenchmen
plundered
those
who
were
in
the
*NL*
boat
,
and
the
poverty
and
distress
in
which
his
comrade
and
the
fair
Moor
*NL*
were
left
,
of
whom
he
said
he
had
not
been
able
to
learn
what
became
of
*NL*
them
,
or
whether
they
had
reached
Spain
,
or
been
carried
to
France
by
the
*NL*
Frenchmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
standing
a
little
to
one
side
,
was
listening
to
all
the
*NL*
curate
said
,
and
watching
every
movement
of
his
brother
,
who
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
perceived
the
curate
had
made
an
end
of
his
story
,
gave
a
deep
sigh
*NL*
and
said
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
,
``
Oh
,
senor
,
if
you
only
knew
what
*NL*
news
you
have
given
me
and
how
it
comes
home
to
me
,
making
me
show
how
I
*NL*
feel
it
with
these
tears
that
spring
from
my
eyes
in
spite
of
all
my
*NL*
worldly
wisdom
and
self-restraint
!
That
brave
captain
that
you
speak
of
*NL*
is
my
eldest
brother
,
who
,
being
of
a
bolder
and
loftier
mind
than
my
*NL*
other
brother
or
myself
,
chose
the
honourable
and
worthy
calling
of
arms
,
*NL*
which
was
one
of
the
three
careers
our
father
proposed
to
us
,
as
your
*NL*
comrade
mentioned
in
that
fable
you
thought
he
was
telling
you
.
I
*NL*
followed
that
of
letters
,
in
which
God
and
my
own
exertions
have
raised
*NL*
me
to
the
position
in
which
you
see
me
.
My
second
brother
is
in
Peru
,
so
*NL*
wealthy
that
with
what
he
has
sent
to
my
father
and
to
me
he
has
fully
*NL*
repaid
the
portion
he
took
with
him
,
and
has
even
furnished
my
father
's
*NL*
hands
with
the
means
of
gratifying
his
natural
generosity
,
while
I
too
*NL*
have
been
enabled
to
pursue
my
studies
in
a
more
becoming
and
creditable
*NL*
fashion
,
and
so
to
attain
my
present
standing
.
My
father
is
still
alive
,
*NL*
though
dying
with
anxiety
to
hear
of
his
eldest
son
,
and
he
prays
God
*NL*
unceasingly
that
death
may
not
close
his
eyes
until
he
has
looked
upon
*NL*
those
of
his
son
;
but
with
regard
to
him
what
surprises
me
is
,
that
*NL*
having
so
much
common
sense
as
he
had
,
he
should
have
neglected
to
give
*NL*
any
intelligence
about
himself
,
either
in
his
troubles
and
sufferings
,
or
*NL*
in
his
prosperity
,
for
if
his
father
or
any
of
us
had
known
of
his
*NL*
condition
he
need
not
have
waited
for
that
miracle
of
the
reed
to
obtain
*NL*
his
ransom
;
but
what
now
disquiets
me
is
the
uncertainty
whether
those
*NL*
Frenchmen
may
have
restored
him
to
liberty
,
or
murdered
him
to
hide
the
*NL*
robbery
.
All
this
will
make
me
continue
my
journey
,
not
with
the
*NL*
satisfaction
in
which
I
began
it
,
but
in
the
deepest
melancholy
and
*NL*
sadness
.
Oh
dear
brother
!
that
I
only
knew
where
thou
art
now
,
and
I
*NL*
would
hasten
to
seek
thee
out
and
deliver
thee
from
thy
sufferings
,
*NL*
though
it
were
to
cost
me
suffering
myself
!
Oh
that
I
could
bring
news
to
*NL*
our
old
father
that
thou
art
alive
,
even
wert
thou
the
deepest
dungeon
of
*NL*
Barbary
;
for
his
wealth
and
my
brother
's
and
mine
would
rescue
thee
*NL*
thence
!
Oh
beautiful
and
generous
Zoraida
,
that
I
could
repay
thy
good
*NL*
goodness
to
a
brother
!
That
I
could
be
present
at
the
new
birth
of
thy
*NL*
soul
,
and
at
thy
bridal
that
would
give
us
all
such
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
and
more
the
Judge
uttered
with
such
deep
emotion
at
the
news
he
*NL*
had
received
of
his
brother
that
all
who
heard
him
shared
in
it
,
showing
*NL*
their
sympathy
with
his
sorrow
.
The
curate
,
seeing
,
then
,
how
well
he
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
carrying
out
his
purpose
and
the
captain
's
wishes
,
had
no
*NL*
desire
to
keep
them
unhappy
any
longer
,
so
he
rose
from
the
table
and
*NL*
going
into
the
room
where
Zoraida
was
he
took
her
by
the
hand
,
Luscinda
,
*NL*
Dorothea
,
and
the
Judge
's
daughter
following
her
.
The
captain
was
waiting
*NL*
to
see
what
the
curate
would
do
,
when
the
latter
,
taking
him
with
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
advanced
with
both
of
them
to
where
the
Judge
and
the
other
*NL*
gentlemen
were
and
said
,
``
Let
your
tears
cease
to
flow
,
Senor
Judge
,
and
*NL*
the
wish
of
your
heart
be
gratified
as
fully
as
you
could
desire
,
for
you
*NL*
have
before
you
your
worthy
brother
and
your
good
sister-in-law
.
He
whom
*NL*
you
see
here
is
the
Captain
Viedma
,
and
this
is
the
fair
Moor
who
has
*NL*
been
so
good
to
him
.
The
Frenchmen
I
told
you
of
have
reduced
them
to
the
*NL*
state
of
poverty
you
see
that
you
may
show
the
generosity
of
your
kind
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
ran
to
embrace
his
brother
,
who
placed
both
hands
on
his
*NL*
breast
so
as
to
have
a
good
look
at
him
,
holding
him
a
little
way
off
but
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
had
fully
recognised
him
he
clasped
him
in
his
arms
so
*NL*
closely
,
shedding
such
tears
of
heartfelt
joy
,
that
most
of
those
present
*NL*
could
not
but
join
in
them
.
The
words
the
brothers
exchanged
,
the
emotion
*NL*
they
showed
can
scarcely
be
imagined
,
I
fancy
,
much
less
put
down
in
*NL*
writing
.
They
told
each
other
in
a
few
words
the
events
of
their
lives
;
*NL*
they
showed
the
true
affection
of
brothers
in
all
its
strength
;
then
the
*NL*
judge
embraced
Zoraida
,
putting
all
he
possessed
at
her
disposal
;
then
he
*NL*
made
his
daughter
embrace
her
,
and
the
fair
Christian
and
the
lovely
Moor
*NL*
drew
fresh
tears
from
every
eye
.
And
there
was
Don
Quixote
observing
all
*NL*
these
strange
proceedings
attentively
without
uttering
a
word
,
and
*NL*
attributing
the
whole
to
chimeras
of
knight-errantry
.
Then
they
agreed
*NL*
that
the
captain
and
Zoraida
should
return
with
his
brother
to
Seville
,
*NL*
and
send
news
to
his
father
of
his
having
been
delivered
and
found
,
so
as
*NL*
to
enable
him
to
come
and
be
present
at
the
marriage
and
baptism
of
*NL*
Zoraida
,
for
it
was
impossible
for
the
Judge
to
put
off
his
journey
,
as
*NL*
he
was
informed
that
in
a
month
from
that
time
the
fleet
was
to
sail
from
*NL*
Seville
for
New
Spain
,
and
to
miss
the
passage
would
have
been
a
great
*NL*
inconvenience
to
him
.
In
short
,
everybody
was
well
pleased
and
glad
at
*NL*
the
captive
's
good
fortune
;
and
as
now
almost
two-thirds
of
the
night
*NL*
were
past
,
they
resolved
to
retire
to
rest
for
the
remainder
of
it
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
offered
to
mount
guard
over
the
castle
lest
they
should
be
*NL*
attacked
by
some
giant
or
other
malevolent
scoundrel
,
covetous
of
the
*NL*
great
treasure
of
beauty
the
castle
contained
.
Those
who
understood
him
*NL*
returned
him
thanks
for
this
service
,
and
they
gave
the
Judge
an
account
*NL*
of
his
extraordinary
humour
,
with
which
he
was
not
a
little
amused
.
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
alone
was
fuming
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
for
retiring
to
*NL*
rest
;
and
he
of
all
was
the
one
that
made
himself
most
comfortable
,
as
he
*NL*
stretched
himself
on
the
trappings
of
his
ass
,
which
,
as
will
be
told
*NL*
farther
on
,
cost
him
so
dear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
,
then
,
having
retired
to
their
chamber
,
and
the
others
having
*NL*
disposed
themselves
with
as
little
discomfort
as
they
could
,
Don
Quixote
*NL*
sallied
out
of
the
inn
to
act
as
sentinel
of
the
castle
as
he
had
*NL*
promised
.
It
happened
,
however
,
that
a
little
before
the
approach
of
dawn
*NL*
a
voice
so
musical
and
sweet
reached
the
ears
of
the
ladies
that
it
*NL*
forced
them
all
to
listen
attentively
,
but
especially
Dorothea
,
who
had
*NL*
been
awake
,
and
by
whose
side
Dona
Clara
de
Viedma
,
for
so
the
Judge
's
*NL*
daughter
was
called
,
lay
sleeping
.
No
one
could
imagine
who
it
was
that
*NL*
sang
so
sweetly
,
and
the
voice
was
unaccompanied
by
any
instrument
.
At
*NL*
one
moment
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
the
singer
were
in
the
courtyard
,
at
*NL*
another
in
the
stable
;
and
as
they
were
all
attention
,
wondering
,
*NL*
Cardenio
came
to
the
door
and
said
,
``
Listen
,
whoever
is
not
asleep
,
and
*NL*
you
will
hear
a
muleteer
's
voice
that
enchants
as
it
chants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
listening
to
it
already
,
senor
,
''
said
Dorothea
;
on
which
Cardenio
*NL*
went
away
;
and
Dorothea
,
giving
all
her
attention
to
it
,
made
out
the
*NL*
words
of
the
song
to
be
these
:

CHAPTER
XLIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
RELATED
THE
PLEASANT
STORY
OF
THE
MULETEER
,
TOGETHER
WITH
*NL*
OTHER
STRANGE
THINGS
THAT
CAME
TO
PASS
IN
THE
INN
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
me
,
Love
's
mariner
am
I
*NL*
On
Love
's
deep
ocean
sailing
;
*NL*
I
know
not
where
the
haven
lies
,
*NL*
I
dare
not
hope
to
gain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
solitary
distant
star
*NL*
Is
all
I
have
to
guide
me
,
*NL*
A
brighter
orb
than
those
of
old
*NL*
That
Palinurus
lighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
vaguely
drifting
am
I
borne
,
*NL*
I
know
not
where
it
leads
me
;
*NL*
I
fix
my
gaze
on
it
alone
,
*NL*
Of
all
beside
it
heedless
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
over-cautious
prudery
,
*NL*
And
coyness
cold
and
cruel
,
*NL*
When
most
I
need
it
,
these
,
like
clouds
,
*NL*
Its
longed-for
light
refuse
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bright
star
,
goal
of
my
yearning
eyes
*NL*
As
thou
above
me
beamest
,
*NL*
When
thou
shalt
hide
thee
from
my
sight
*NL*
I
'll
know
that
death
is
near
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
singer
had
got
so
far
when
it
struck
Dorothea
that
it
was
not
fair
to
*NL*
let
Clara
miss
hearing
such
a
sweet
voice
,
so
,
shaking
her
from
side
to
*NL*
side
,
she
woke
her
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
child
,
for
waking
thee
,
but
I
do
so
that
thou
mayest
have
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
best
voice
thou
hast
ever
heard
,
perhaps
,
in
*NL*
all
thy
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
awoke
quite
drowsy
,
and
not
understanding
at
the
moment
what
*NL*
Dorothea
said
,
asked
her
what
it
was
;
she
repeated
what
she
had
said
,
and
*NL*
Clara
became
attentive
at
once
;
but
she
had
hardly
heard
two
lines
,
as
*NL*
the
singer
continued
,
when
a
strange
trembling
seized
her
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
suffering
from
a
severe
attack
of
quartan
ague
,
and
throwing
her
arms
*NL*
round
Dorothea
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
dear
lady
of
my
soul
and
life
!
why
did
you
wake
me
?
The
greatest
*NL*
kindness
fortune
could
do
me
now
would
be
to
close
my
eyes
and
ears
so
as
*NL*
neither
to
see
or
hear
that
unhappy
musician
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
thou
talking
about
,
child
?
''
said
Dorothea
.
``
Why
,
they
say
this
*NL*
singer
is
a
muleteer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
he
is
the
lord
of
many
places
,
''
replied
Clara
,
``
and
that
one
in
my
*NL*
heart
which
he
holds
so
firmly
shall
never
be
taken
from
him
,
unless
he
*NL*
be
willing
to
surrender
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
was
amazed
at
the
ardent
language
of
the
girl
,
for
it
seemed
to
*NL*
be
far
beyond
such
experience
of
life
as
her
tender
years
gave
any
*NL*
promise
of
,
so
she
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
in
such
a
way
that
I
can
not
understand
you
,
Senora
Clara
;
*NL*
explain
yourself
more
clearly
,
and
tell
me
what
is
this
you
are
saying
*NL*
about
hearts
and
places
and
this
musician
whose
voice
has
so
moved
you
?
*NL*
But
do
not
tell
me
anything
now
;
I
do
not
want
to
lose
the
pleasure
I
get
*NL*
from
listening
to
the
singer
by
giving
my
attention
to
your
transports
,
*NL*
for
I
perceive
he
is
beginning
to
sing
a
new
strain
and
a
new
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
''
returned
Clara
;
and
not
to
hear
him
she
*NL*
stopped
both
ears
with
her
hands
,
at
which
Dorothea
was
again
surprised
;
*NL*
but
turning
her
attention
to
the
song
she
found
that
it
ran
in
this
*NL*
fashion
:
*NL*
*NL*
Sweet
Hope
,
my
stay
,
*NL*
That
onward
to
the
goal
of
thy
intent
*NL*
Dost
make
thy
way
,
*NL*
Heedless
of
hindrance
or
impediment
,
*NL*
Have
thou
no
fear
*NL*
If
at
each
step
thou
findest
death
is
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
victory
,
*NL*
No
joy
of
triumph
doth
the
faint
heart
know
;
*NL*
Unblest
is
he
*NL*
That
a
bold
front
to
Fortune
dares
not
show
,
*NL*
But
soul
and
sense
*NL*
In
bondage
yieldeth
up
to
indolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Love
his
wares
*NL*
Do
dearly
sell
,
his
right
must
be
contest
;
*NL*
What
gold
compares
*NL*
With
that
whereon
his
stamp
he
hath
imprest
?
*NL*
And
all
men
know
*NL*
What
costeth
little
that
we
rate
but
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
Love
resolute
*NL*
Knows
not
the
word
``
impossibility
;
''
*NL*
And
though
my
suit
*NL*
Beset
by
endless
obstacles
I
see
,
*NL*
Yet
no
despair
*NL*
Shall
hold
me
bound
to
earth
while
heaven
is
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
voice
ceased
and
Clara
's
sobs
began
afresh
,
all
which
excited
*NL*
Dorothea
's
curiosity
to
know
what
could
be
the
cause
of
singing
so
sweet
*NL*
and
weeping
so
bitter
,
so
she
again
asked
her
what
it
was
she
was
going
*NL*
to
say
before
.
On
this
Clara
,
afraid
that
Luscinda
might
overhear
her
,
*NL*
winding
her
arms
tightly
round
Dorothea
put
her
mouth
so
close
to
her
ear
*NL*
that
she
could
speak
without
fear
of
being
heard
by
anyone
else
,
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
singer
,
dear
senora
,
is
the
son
of
a
gentleman
of
Aragon
,
lord
of
*NL*
two
villages
,
who
lives
opposite
my
father
's
house
at
Madrid
;
and
though
*NL*
my
father
had
curtains
to
the
windows
of
his
house
in
winter
,
and
*NL*
lattice-work
in
summer
,
in
some
way
--
I
know
not
how
--
this
gentleman
,
who
*NL*
was
pursuing
his
studies
,
saw
me
,
whether
in
church
or
elsewhere
,
I
*NL*
can
not
tell
,
and
,
in
fact
,
fell
in
love
with
me
,
and
gave
me
to
know
it
*NL*
from
the
windows
of
his
house
,
with
so
many
signs
and
tears
that
I
was
*NL*
forced
to
believe
him
,
and
even
to
love
him
,
without
knowing
what
it
was
*NL*
he
wanted
of
me
.
One
of
the
signs
he
used
to
make
me
was
to
link
one
hand
*NL*
in
the
other
,
to
show
me
he
wished
to
marry
me
;
and
though
I
should
have
*NL*
been
glad
if
that
could
be
,
being
alone
and
motherless
I
knew
not
whom
to
*NL*
open
my
mind
to
,
and
so
I
left
it
as
it
was
,
showing
him
no
favour
,
*NL*
except
when
my
father
,
and
his
too
,
were
from
home
,
to
raise
the
curtain
*NL*
or
the
lattice
a
little
and
let
him
see
me
plainly
,
at
which
he
would
*NL*
show
such
delight
that
he
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
mad
.
Meanwhile
the
*NL*
time
for
my
father
's
departure
arrived
,
which
he
became
aware
of
,
but
not
*NL*
from
me
,
for
I
had
never
been
able
to
tell
him
of
it
.
He
fell
sick
,
of
*NL*
grief
I
believe
,
and
so
the
day
we
were
going
away
I
could
not
see
him
to
*NL*
take
farewell
of
him
,
were
it
only
with
the
eyes
.
But
after
we
had
been
*NL*
two
days
on
the
road
,
on
entering
the
posada
of
a
village
a
day
's
journey
*NL*
from
this
,
I
saw
him
at
the
inn
door
in
the
dress
of
a
muleteer
,
and
so
*NL*
well
disguised
,
that
if
I
did
not
carry
his
image
graven
on
my
heart
it
*NL*
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
recognise
him
.
But
I
knew
him
,
and
I
*NL*
was
surprised
,
and
glad
;
he
watched
me
,
unsuspected
by
my
father
,
from
*NL*
whom
he
always
hides
himself
when
he
crosses
my
path
on
the
road
,
or
in
*NL*
the
posadas
where
we
halt
;
and
,
as
I
know
what
he
is
,
and
reflect
that
*NL*
for
love
of
me
he
makes
this
journey
on
foot
in
all
this
hardship
,
I
am
*NL*
ready
to
die
of
sorrow
;
and
where
he
sets
foot
there
I
set
my
eyes
.
I
*NL*
know
not
with
what
object
he
has
come
;
or
how
he
could
have
got
away
from
*NL*
his
father
,
who
loves
him
beyond
measure
,
having
no
other
heir
,
and
*NL*
because
he
deserves
it
,
as
you
will
perceive
when
you
see
him
.
And
*NL*
moreover
,
I
can
tell
you
,
all
that
he
sings
is
out
of
his
own
head
;
for
I
*NL*
have
heard
them
say
he
is
a
great
scholar
and
poet
;
and
what
is
more
,
*NL*
every
time
I
see
him
or
hear
him
sing
I
tremble
all
over
,
and
am
*NL*
terrified
lest
my
father
should
recognise
him
and
come
to
know
of
our
*NL*
loves
.
I
have
never
spoken
a
word
to
him
in
my
life
;
and
for
all
that
I
*NL*
love
him
so
that
I
could
not
live
without
him
.
This
,
dear
senora
,
is
all
*NL*
I
have
to
tell
you
about
the
musician
whose
voice
has
delighted
you
so
*NL*
much
;
and
from
it
alone
you
might
easily
perceive
he
is
no
muleteer
,
but
*NL*
a
lord
of
hearts
and
towns
,
as
I
told
you
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no
more
,
Dona
Clara
,
''
said
Dorothea
at
this
,
at
the
same
time
*NL*
kissing
her
a
thousand
times
over
,
``
say
no
more
,
I
tell
you
,
but
wait
*NL*
till
day
comes

when
I
trust
in
God
to
arrange
this
affair
of
yours
so
*NL*
that
it
may
have
the
happy
ending
such
an
innocent
beginning
deserves
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
senora
,
''
said
Dona
Clara
,
``
what
end
can
be
hoped
for
when
his
father
*NL*
is
of
such
lofty
position

so
wealthy

that
he
would
think
I
was
not
*NL*
fit
to
be
even
a
servant
to
his
son
,
much
less
wife
?
And
as
to
marrying
*NL*
without
the
knowledge
of
my
father

I
would
not
do
it
for
all

*NL*
I
would
not
ask
anything
more
than
that
this
youth
should
go
back

*NL*
leave
me
;
perhaps
with
not
seeing
him
,
and
the
long
distance
we
shall
*NL*
have
to
travel

the
pain
I
suffer
now
may
become
easier
;
though
I

*NL*
the
remedy
I
propose
will
do
me
very

have
for

I
such

a
young

he
such
a

I
verily
believe
we
are
both
of
*NL*
an
age
,

I
am
not
sixteen
yet

I
will
be
sixteen
Michaelmas
Day

next

*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
could
not
help
laughing
to
hear
how
like
a
child
Dona
Clara
*NL*
spoke
.
``
Let
us
go
to
sleep
now
,
senora
,
''
said
she
,
``
for
the
little
of
the
*NL*
night
that
I
fancy
is
left
to
us
:
God
will
soon
send
us
daylight
,
and
we
*NL*
will
set
all
to
rights
,
or
it
will
go
hard
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
they
fell
asleep
,
and
deep
silence
reigned
all
through
the
inn
.
*NL*
The
only
persons
not
asleep
were
the
landlady
's
daughter
and
her
servant
*NL*
Maritornes
,
who
,
knowing
the
weak
point
of
Don
Quixote
's
humour
,
and
that
*NL*
he
was
outside
the
inn
mounting
guard
in
armour
and
on
horseback
,
*NL*
resolved
,
the
pair
of
them
,
to
play
some
trick
upon
him
,
or
at
any
rate
*NL*
to
amuse
themselves
for
a
while
by
listening
to
his
nonsense
.
As
it
so
*NL*
happened
there
was
not
a
window
in
the
whole
inn
that
looked
outwards
*NL*
except
a
hole
in
the
wall
of
a
straw-loft
through
which
they
used
to
*NL*
throw
out
the
straw
.
At
this
hole
the
two
demi-damsels
posted
themselves
,
*NL*
and
observed
Don
Quixote
on
his
horse
,
leaning
on
his
pike
and
from
time
*NL*
to
time
sending
forth
such
deep
and
doleful
sighs
,
that
he
seemed
to
*NL*
pluck
up
his
soul
by
the
roots
with
each
of
them
;
and
they
could
hear
*NL*
him
,
too
,
saying
in
a
soft
,
tender
,
loving
tone
,
``
Oh
my
lady
Dulcinea

of
all
beauty

and
crown
of

,
depositary
of
virtue
,
and
finally
,
ideal
of
all
*NL*
that
is
good
,
honourable
,
and
delectable
in
this
world
!
What
is
thy
grace
*NL*
doing
now
?
Art
thou
,
perchance
,
mindful
of
thy
enslaved
knight
who
of
his
*NL*
own
free
will
hath
exposed
himself
to
so
great
perils
,
and
all
to
serve
*NL*
thee
?
Give
me
tidings
of
her
,
oh
luminary
of
the
three
faces
!
Perhaps
at
*NL*
this
moment
,
envious
of
hers
,
thou
art
regarding
her
,
either
as
she
paces
*NL*
to
and
fro
some
gallery
of
her
sumptuous
palaces
,
or
leans
over
some
*NL*
balcony
,
meditating
how
,
whilst
preserving
her
purity
and
greatness
,
she
*NL*
may
mitigate
the
tortures
this
wretched
heart
of
mine
endures
for
her
*NL*
sake
,
what
glory
should
recompense
my
sufferings
,
what
repose
my
toil
,
*NL*
and
lastly
what
death
my
life
,
and
what
reward
my
services
?
And
thou
,
oh
*NL*
sun
,
that
art
now
doubtless
harnessing
thy
steeds
in
haste
to
rise
*NL*
betimes
and
come
forth
to
see
my
lady
;
when
thou
seest
her
I
entreat
of
*NL*
thee
to
salute
her
on
my
behalf
:
but
have
a
care
,
when
thou
shalt
see
her
*NL*
and
salute
her
,
that
thou
kiss
not
her
face
;
for
I
shall
be
more
jealous
*NL*
of
thee
than
thou
wert
of
that
light-footed
ingrate
that
made
thee
sweat
*NL*
and
run
so
on
the
plains
of
Thessaly
,
or
on
the
banks
of
the
Peneus

for
*NL*
I
do
not
exactly
recollect
where
it
was
thou
didst
run
on
that
occasion

*NL*
in
thy
jealousy
and
love

*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
had
got
so
far
in
his
pathetic
speech
when
the
landlady
's
*NL*
daughter
began
to
signal
to
him
,
saying
,
``
Senor
,
come
over
here
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
signals
and
voice
Don
Quixote
turned
his
head
and
saw
by
the
*NL*
light
of
the
moon
,
which
then
was
in
its
full
splendour
,
that
some
one
*NL*
was
calling
to
him
from
the
hole
in
the
wall
,
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
*NL*
window
,
and
what
is
more
,
with
a
gilt
grating
,
as
rich
castles
,
such
as
*NL*
he
believed
the
inn
to
be
,
ought
to
have
;
and
it
immediately
suggested
*NL*
itself
to
his
imagination
that
,
as
on
the
former
occasion
,
the
fair
*NL*
damsel
,
the
daughter
of
the
lady
of
the
castle
,
overcome
by
love
for
him
,
*NL*
was
once
more
endeavouring
to
win
his
affections
;
and
with
this
idea
,
not
*NL*
to
show
himself
discourteous
,
or
ungrateful
,
he
turned
Rocinante
's
head
*NL*
and
approached
the
hole
,
and
as
he
perceived
the
two
wenches
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pity
you
,
beauteous
lady
,
that
you
should
have
directed
your
thoughts
*NL*
of
love
to
a
quarter
from
whence
it
is
impossible
that
such
a
return
can
*NL*
be
made
to
you
as
is
due
to
your
great
merit
and
gentle
birth
,
for
which
*NL*
you
must
not
blame
this
unhappy
knight-errant
whom
love
renders
incapable
*NL*
of
submission
to
any
other
than
her
whom
,
the
first
moment
his
eyes
*NL*
beheld
her
,
he
made
absolute
mistress
of
his
soul
.
Forgive
me
,
noble
*NL*
lady
,
and
retire
to
your
apartment
,
and
do
not
,
by
any
further
*NL*
declaration
of
your
passion
,
compel
me
to
show
myself
more
ungrateful
;
*NL*
and
if
,
of
the
love
you
bear
me
,
you
should
find
that
there
is
anything
*NL*
else
in
my
power
wherein
I
can
gratify
you
,
provided
it
be
not
love
*NL*
itself
,
demand
it
of
me
;
for
I
swear
to
you
by
that
sweet
absent
enemy
of
*NL*
mine
to
grant
it
this
instant
,
though
it
be
that
you
require
of
me
a
lock
*NL*
of
Medusa
's
hair
,
which
was
all
snakes
,
or
even
the
very
beams
of
the
sun
*NL*
shut
up
in
a
vial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mistress
wants
nothing
of
that
sort

knight

said
Maritornes
at
*NL*
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
,
discreet
dame
,
is
it
that
your
mistress
wants
?

replied
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
one
of
your
fair
hands
,
''
said
Maritornes
,
``
to
enable
her
to
vent
*NL*
over
it
the
great
passion
which
has
brought
her
to
this
loophole
,
*NL*
so
much
to
the
risk
of
her
honour
;
for
if
the
lord
her
father
had
heard
*NL*
her
,
the
least
slice
he
would
cut
off
her
would
be
her
ear
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
that
tried

said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
he
had
better
*NL*
beware
of
that
,
if
he
does
not
want
to
meet
the
most
disastrous
end
that
*NL*
ever
father
in
the
world
met
for
having
laid
hands
on
the
tender
limbs
of
*NL*
a
love-stricken
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maritornes
felt
sure
that
Don
Quixote
would
present
the
hand
she
had
*NL*
asked
,
and
making
up
her
mind
what
to
do
,
she
got
down
from
the
hole
and
*NL*
went
into
the
stable
,
where
she
took
the
halter
of
Sancho
Panza
's
ass
,
*NL*
and
in
all
haste
returned
to
the
hole
,
just
as
Don
Quixote
had
planted
*NL*
himself
standing
on
Rocinante
's
saddle
in
order
to
reach
the
grated
*NL*
window
where
he
supposed
the
lovelorn
damsel
to
be
;
and
giving
her
his
*NL*
hand
,
he
said
,
``
Lady
,
take
this
hand
,
or
rather
this
scourge
of
the
*NL*
evil-doers
of
the
earth
;
take
,
I
say
,
this
hand
which
no
other
hand
of
*NL*
woman
has
ever
touched
,
not
even
hers
who
has
complete
possession
of
my
*NL*
entire
body
.
I
present
it
to
you
,
not
that
you
may
kiss
it
,
but
that
you
*NL*
may
observe
the
contexture
of
the
sinews
,
the
close
network
of
the
*NL*
muscles
,
the
breadth
and
capacity
of
the
veins
,
whence
you
may
infer
what
*NL*
must
be
the
strength
of
the
arm
that
has
such
a
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
we
shall
see
presently
,
''
said
Maritornes
,
and
making
a
running
knot
*NL*
on
the
halter
,
she
passed
it
over
his
wrist
and
coming
down
from
the
hole
*NL*
tied
the
other
end
very
firmly
to
the
bolt
of
the
door
of
the
straw-loft
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
feeling
the
roughness
of
the
rope
on
his
wrist
,
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
Your
grace
seems
to
be
grating
rather
than
caressing
my
hand
;
treat
it
*NL*
not
so
harshly
,
for
it
is
not
to
blame
for
the
offence
my
resolution
has
*NL*
given
you
,
nor
is
it
just
to
wreak
all
your
vengeance
on
so
small
a
part
;
*NL*
remember
that
one
who
loves
so
well
should
not
revenge
herself
so
*NL*
cruelly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
nobody
now
to
listen
to
these
words
of
Don
Quixote
's
,
for
*NL*
as
soon
as
Maritornes
had
tied
him
she
and
the
other
made
off
,
ready
to
*NL*
die
with
laughing
,
leaving
him
fastened
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
him
to
release
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
as
has
been
said
,
standing
on
Rocinante
,
with
his
arm
passed
*NL*
through
the
hole
and
his
wrist
tied
to
the
bolt
of
the
door
,
and
in
*NL*
mighty
fear
and
dread
of
being
left
hanging
by
the
arm
if
Rocinante
were
*NL*
to
stir
one
side
or
the
other
;
so
he
did
not
dare
to
make
the
least
*NL*
movement
,
although
from
the
patience
and
imperturbable
disposition
of
*NL*
Rocinante
,
he
had
good
reason
to
expect
that
he
would
stand
without
*NL*
budging
for
a
whole
century
.
Finding
himself
fast
,
then
,
and
that
the
*NL*
ladies
had
retired
,
he
began
to
fancy
that
all
this
was
done
by
*NL*
enchantment
,
as
on
the
former
occasion
when
in
that
same
castle
that
*NL*
enchanted
Moor
of
a
carrier
had
belaboured
him
;
and
he
cursed
in
his
*NL*
heart
his
own
want
of
sense
and
judgment
in
venturing
to
enter
the
castle
*NL*
again
,
after
having
come
off
so
badly
the
first
time
;
it
being
a
settled
*NL*
point
with
knights-errant
that
when
they
have
tried
an
adventure
,
and
*NL*
have
not
succeeded
in
it
,
it
is
a
sign
that
it
is
not
reserved
for
them
*NL*
but
for
others
,
and
that
therefore
they
need
not
try
it
again
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
he
pulled
his
arm
to
see
if
he
could
release
himself
,
but
it
*NL*
had
been
made
so
fast
that
all
his
efforts
were
in
vain
.
It
is
true
he
*NL*
pulled
it
gently
lest
Rocinante
should
move
,
but
try
as
he
might
to
seat
*NL*
himself
in
the
saddle
,
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
stand
upright
or
pull
*NL*
his
hand
off
.
Then
it
was
he
wished
for
the
sword
of
Amadis
,
against
*NL*
which
no
enchantment
whatever
had
any
power
;
then
he
cursed
his
ill
*NL*
fortune
;
then
he
magnified
the
loss
the
world
would
sustain
by
his
*NL*
absence
while
he
remained
there
enchanted
,
for
that
he
believed
he
was
*NL*
beyond
all
doubt
;
then
he
once
more
took
to
thinking
of
his
beloved
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
;
then
he
called
to
his
worthy
squire
Sancho
Panza
,
*NL*
who
,
buried
in
sleep
and
stretched
upon
the
pack-saddle
of
his
ass
,
was
*NL*
oblivious
,
at
that
moment
,
of
the
mother
that
bore
him
;
then
he
called
*NL*
upon
the
sages
Lirgandeo
and
Alquife
to
come
to
his
aid
;
then
he
invoked
*NL*
his
good
friend
Urganda
to
succour
him
;
and
then
,
at
last
,
morning
found
*NL*
him
in
such
a
state
of
desperation
and
perplexity
that
he
was
bellowing
*NL*
like
a
bull
,
for
he
had
no
hope
that
day
would
bring
any
relief
to
his
*NL*
suffering
,
which
he
believed
would
last
for
ever
,
inasmuch
as
he
was
*NL*
enchanted
;
and
of
this
he
was
convinced
by
seeing
that
Rocinante
never
*NL*
stirred
,
much
or
little
,
and
he
felt
persuaded
that
he
and
his
horse
were
*NL*
to
remain
in
this
state
,
without
eating
or
drinking
or
sleeping
,
until
*NL*
the
malign
influence
of
the
stars
was
overpast
,
or
until
some
other
more
*NL*
sage
enchanter
should
disenchant
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
very
much
deceived
in
this
conclusion
,
for
daylight
had
hardly
*NL*
begun
to
appear
when
there
came
up
to
the
inn
four
men
on
horseback
,
well
*NL*
equipped
and
accoutred
,
with
firelocks
across
their
saddle-bows
.
They
*NL*
called
out
and
knocked
loudly
at
the
gate
of
the
inn
,
which
was
still
*NL*
shut
;
on
seeing
which
,
Don
Quixote
,
even
there
where
he
was
,
did
not
*NL*
forget
to
act
as
sentinel
,
and
said
in
a
loud
and
imperious
tone
,
*NL*
``
Knights
,
or
squires
,
or
whatever
ye
be
,
ye
have
no
right
to
knock
at
the
*NL*
gates
of
this
castle
;
for
it
is
plain
enough
that
they
who
are
within
are
*NL*
either
asleep
,
or
else
are
not
in
the
habit
of
throwing
open
the
fortress
*NL*
until
the
sun
's
rays
are
spread
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
Withdraw
to
a
distance
,
and
wait
till
it
is
broad
daylight
,
and
then
we
*NL*
shall
see
whether
it
will
be
proper
or
not
to
open
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
fortress
or
castle
is
this
,
''
said
one
,
``
to
make
us
stand
*NL*
on
such
ceremony
?
If
you
are
the
innkeeper
bid
them
open
to
us
;
we
are
*NL*
travellers
who
only
want
to
feed
our
horses
and
go
on
,
for
we
are
in
*NL*
haste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
gentlemen
,
that
I
look
like
an
innkeeper
?
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
look
like
,
''
replied
the
other
;
``
but
I
know
that
*NL*
you
are
talking
nonsense
when
you
call
this
inn
a
castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
castle
it
is
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
nay
,
more
,
one
of
the
best
in
*NL*
this
whole
province
,
and
it
has
within
it
people
who
have
had
the
sceptre
*NL*
in
the
hand
and
the
crown
on
the
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
better
if
it
were
the
other
way
,
''
said
the
traveller
,
``
the
*NL*
sceptre
on
the
head
and
the
crown
in
the
hand
;
but
if
so
,
may
be
there
is
*NL*
within
some
company
of
players
,
with
whom
it
is
a
common
thing
to
have
*NL*
those
crowns
and
sceptres
you
speak
of
;
for
in
such
a
small
inn
as
this
,
*NL*
and
where
such
silence
is
kept
,
I
do
not
believe
any
people
entitled
to
*NL*
crowns
and
sceptres
can
have
taken
up
their
quarters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
but
little
of
the
world
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
since
you
are
*NL*
ignorant
of
what
commonly
occurs
in
knight-errantry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
comrades
of
the
spokesman
,
growing
weary
of
the
dialogue
with
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
renewed
their
knocks
with
great
vehemence
,
so
much
so
that
the
*NL*
host
,
and
not
only
he
but
everybody
in
the
inn
,
awoke
,
and
he
got
up
to
*NL*
ask
who
knocked
.
It
happened
at
this
moment
that
one
of
the
horses
of
the
*NL*
four
who
were
seeking
admittance
went
to
smell
Rocinante
,
who
melancholy
,
*NL*
dejected
,
and
with
drooping
ears
stood
motionless
,
supporting
his
sorely
*NL*
stretched
master
;
and
as
he
was
,
after
all
,
flesh
,
though
he
looked
as
if
*NL*
he
were
made
of
wood
,
he
could
not
help
giving
way
and
in
return
smelling
*NL*
the
one
who
had
come
to
offer
him
attentions
.
But
he
had
hardly
moved
at
*NL*
all
when
Don
Quixote
lost
his
footing
;
and
slipping
off
the
saddle
,
he
*NL*
would
have
come
to
the
ground
,
but
for
being
suspended
by
the
arm
,
which
*NL*
caused
him
such
agony
that
he
believed
either
his
wrist
would
be
cut
*NL*
through
or
his
arm
torn
off
;
and
he
hung
so
near
the
ground
that
he
could
*NL*
just
touch
it
with
his
feet
,
which
was
all
the
worse
for
him
;
for
,
*NL*
finding
how
little
was
wanted
to
enable
him
to
plant
his
feet
firmly
,
he
*NL*
struggled
and
stretched
himself
as
much
as
he
could
to
gain
a
footing
;
*NL*
just
like
those
undergoing
the
torture
of
the
strappado
,
when
they
are
*NL*
fixed
at
``
touch
and
no
touch
,
''
who
aggravate
their
own
sufferings
by
*NL*
their
violent
efforts
to
stretch
themselves
,
deceived
by
the
hope
which
*NL*
makes
them
fancy
that
with
a
very
little
more
they
will
reach
the
ground
.

CHAPTER
XLIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
ARE
CONTINUED
THE
UNHEARD-OF
ADVENTURES
OF
THE
INN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
loud
,
in
fact
,
were
the
shouts
of
Don
Quixote
,
that
the
landlord
*NL*
opening
the
gate
of
the
inn
in
all
haste
,
came
out
in
dismay
,
and
ran
to
*NL*
see
who
was
uttering
such
cries
,
and
those
who
were
outside
joined
him
.
*NL*
Maritornes
,
who
had
been
by
this
time
roused
up
by
the
same
outcry
,
*NL*
suspecting
what
it
was
,
ran
to
the
loft
and
,
without
anyone
seeing
her
,
*NL*
untied
the
halter
by
which
Don
Quixote
was
suspended
,
and
down
he
came
to
*NL*
the
ground
in
the
sight
of
the
landlord
and
the
travellers
,
who
*NL*
approaching
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
with
him
that
he
shouted
so
.
He
*NL*
without
replying
a
word
took
the
rope
off
his
wrist
,
and
rising
to
his
*NL*
feet
leaped
upon
Rocinante
,
braced
his
buckler
on
his
arm
,
put
his
lance
*NL*
in
rest
,
and
making
a
considerable
circuit
of
the
plain
came
back
at
a
*NL*
half-gallop
exclaiming
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whoever
shall
say
that
I
have
been
enchanted
with
just
cause
,
provided
*NL*
my
lady
the
Princess
Micomicona
grants
me
permission
to
do
so
,
I
give
him
*NL*
the
lie
,
challenge
him
and
defy
him
to
single
combat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
newly
arrived
travellers
were
amazed
at
the
words
of
Don
Quixote
;
but
*NL*
the
landlord
removed
their
surprise
by
telling
them
who
he
was
,
and
not
*NL*
to
mind
him
as
he
was
out
of
his
senses
.
They
then
asked
the
landlord
if
*NL*
by
any
chance
a
youth
of
about
fifteen
years
of
age
had
come
to
that
inn
,
*NL*
one
dressed
like
a
muleteer
,
and
of
such
and
such
an
appearance
,
*NL*
describing
that
of
Dona
Clara
's
lover
.
The
landlord
replied
that
there
*NL*
were
so
many
people
in
the
inn
he
had
not
noticed
the
person
they
were
*NL*
inquiring
for
;
but
one
of
them
observing
the
coach
in
which
the
Judge
had
*NL*
come
,
said
,
``
He
is
here
no
doubt
,
for
this
is
the
coach
he
is
following
:
*NL*
let
one
of
us
stay
at
the
gate
,
and
the
rest
go
in
to
look
for
him
;
or
*NL*
indeed
it
would
be
as
well
if
one
of
us
went
round
the
inn
,
lest
he
*NL*
should
escape
over
the
wall
of
the
yard
.
''
``
So
be
it
,
''
said
another
;
and
*NL*
while
two
of
them
went
in
,
one
remained
at
the
gate
and
the
other
made
*NL*
the
circuit
of
the
inn
;
observing
all
which
,
the
landlord
was
unable
to
*NL*
conjecture
for
what
reason
they
were
taking
all
these
precautions
,
though
*NL*
he
understood
they
were
looking
for
the
youth
whose
description
they
had
*NL*
given
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
by
this
time
broad
daylight
;
and
for
that
reason
,
as
well
as
in
*NL*
consequence
of
the
noise
Don
Quixote
had
made
,
everybody
was
awake
and
*NL*
up
,
but
particularly
Dona
Clara
and
Dorothea
;
for
they
had
been
able
to
*NL*
sleep
but
badly
that
night
,
the
one
from
agitation
at
having
her
lover
so
*NL*
near
her
,
the
other
from
curiosity
to
see
him
.
Don
Quixote
,
when
he
saw
*NL*
that
not
one
of
the
four
travellers
took
any
notice
of
him
or
replied
to
*NL*
his
challenge
,
was
furious
and
ready
to
die
with
indignation
and
wrath
;
*NL*
and
if
he
could
have
found
in
the
ordinances
of
chivalry
that
it
was
*NL*
lawful
for
a
knight-errant
to
undertake
or
engage
in
another
enterprise
,
*NL*
when
he
had
plighted
his
word
and
faith
not
to
involve
himself
in
any
*NL*
until
he
had
made
an
end
of
the
one
to
which
he
was
pledged
,
he
would
*NL*
have
attacked
the
whole
of
them
,
and
would
have
made
them
return
an
*NL*
answer
in
spite
of
themselves
.
But
considering
that
it
would
not
become
*NL*
him
,
nor
be
right
,
to
begin
any
new
emprise
until
he
had
established
*NL*
Micomicona
in
her
kingdom
,
he
was
constrained
to
hold
his
peace
and
wait
*NL*
quietly
to
see
what
would
be
the
upshot
of
the
proceedings
of
those
same
*NL*
travellers
;
one
of
whom
found
the
youth
they
were
seeking
lying
asleep
by
*NL*
the
side
of
a
muleteer
,
without
a
thought
of
anyone
coming
in
search
of
*NL*
him
,
much
less
finding
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
laid
hold
of
him
by
the
arm
,
saying
,
``
It
becomes
you
well
indeed
,
*NL*
Senor
Don
Luis
,
to
be
in
the
dress
you
wear
,
and
well
the
bed
in
which
I
*NL*
find
you
agrees
with
the
luxury
in
which
your
mother
reared
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
rubbed
his
sleepy
eyes
and
stared
for
a
while
at
him
who
held
*NL*
him
,
but
presently
recognised
him
as
one
of
his
father
's
servants
,
at
*NL*
which
he
was
so
taken
aback
that
for
some
time
he
could
not
find
or
utter
*NL*
a
word
;
while
the
servant
went
on
to
say
,
``
There
is
nothing
for
it
now
,
*NL*
Senor
Don
Luis
,
but
to
submit
quietly
and
return
home
,
unless
it
is
your
*NL*
wish
that
my
lord
,
your
father
,
should
take
his
departure
for
the
other
*NL*
world
,
for
nothing
else
can
be
the
consequence
of
the
grief
he
is
in
at
*NL*
your
absence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
did
my
father
know
that
I
had
gone
this
road
and
in
this
dress
?
''
*NL*
said
Don
Luis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
student
to
whom
you
confided
your
intentions
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
servant
,
``
that
disclosed
them
,
touched
with
pity
at
the
distress
he
saw
*NL*
your
father
suffer
on
missing
you
;
he
therefore
despatched
four
of
his
*NL*
servants
in
quest
of
you
,
and
here
we
all
are
at
your
service
,
better
*NL*
pleased
than
you
can
imagine
that
we
shall
return
so
soon
and
be
able
to
*NL*
restore
you
to
those
eyes
that
so
yearn
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
shall
be
as
I
please
,
or
as
heaven
orders
,
''
returned
Don
Luis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
please
or
heaven
order
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
except
to
agree
*NL*
to
go
back
?
Anything
else
is
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
conversation
between
the
two
was
overheard
by
the
muleteer
at
*NL*
whose
side
Don
Luis
lay
,
and
rising
,
he
went
to
report
what
had
taken
*NL*
place
to
Don
Fernando
,
Cardenio
,
and
the
others
,
who
had
by
this
time
*NL*
dressed
themselves
;
and
told
them
how
the
man
had
addressed
the
youth
as
*NL*
``
Don
,
''
and
what
words
had
passed
,
and
how
he
wanted
him
to
return
to
his
*NL*
father
,
which
the
youth
was
unwilling
to
do
.
With
this
,
and
what
they
*NL*
already
knew
of
the
rare
voice
that
heaven
had
bestowed
upon
him
,
they
*NL*
all
felt
very
anxious
to
know
more
particularly
who
he
was
,
and
even
to
*NL*
help
him
if
it
was
attempted
to
employ
force
against
him
;
so
they
*NL*
hastened
to
where
he
was
still
talking
and
arguing
with
his
servant
.
*NL*
Dorothea
at
this
instant
came
out
of
her
room
,
followed
by
Dona
Clara
all
*NL*
in
a
tremor
;
and
calling
Cardenio
aside
,
she
told
him
in
a
few
words
the
*NL*
story
of
the
musician
and
Dona
Clara
,
and
he
at
the
same
time
told
her
*NL*
what
had
happened
,
how
his
father
's
servants
had
come
in
search
of
him
;
*NL*
but
in
telling
her
so
,
he
did
not
speak
low
enough
but
that
Dona
Clara
*NL*
heard
what
he
said
,
at
which
she
was
so
much
agitated
that
had
not
*NL*
Dorothea
hastened
to
support
her
she
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
Cardenio
then
bade
Dorothea
return
to
her
room
,
as
he
would
endeavour
to
*NL*
make
the
whole
matter
right
,
and
they
did
as
he
desired
.
All
the
four
who
*NL*
had
come
in
quest
of
Don
Luis
had
now
come
into
the
inn
and
surrounded
*NL*
him
,
urging
him
to
return
and
console
his
father
at
once
and
without
a
*NL*
moment
's
delay
.
He
replied
that
he
could
not
do
so
on
any
account
until
*NL*
he
had
concluded
some
business
in
which
his
life
,
honour
,
and
heart
were
*NL*
at
stake
.
The
servants
pressed
him
,
saying
that
most
certainly
they
would
*NL*
not
return
without
him
,
and
that
they
would
take
him
away
whether
he
*NL*
liked
it
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
not
do
that
,
''
replied
Don
Luis
,
``
unless
you
take
me
dead
;
*NL*
though
however
you
take
me
,
it
will
be
without
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
most
of
those
in
the
inn
had
been
attracted
by
the
dispute
,
*NL*
but
particularly
Cardenio
,
Don
Fernando
,
his
companions
,
the
Judge
,
the
*NL*
curate
,
the
barber
,
and
Don
Quixote
;
for
he
now
considered
there
was
no
*NL*
necessity
for
mounting
guard
over
the
castle
any
longer
.
Cardenio
being
*NL*
already
acquainted
with
the
young
man
's
story
,
asked
the
men
who
wanted
*NL*
to
take
him
away
,
what
object
they
had
in
seeking
to
carry
off
this
youth
*NL*
against
his
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
object
,
''
said
one
of
the
four
,
``
is
to
save
the
life
of
his
father
,
*NL*
who
is
in
danger
of
losing
it
through
this
gentleman
's
disappearance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
Don
Luis
exclaimed
,
``
There
is
no
need
to
make
my
affairs
public
*NL*
here
;
I
am
free
,
and
I
will
return
if
I
please
;
and
if
not
,
none
of
you
*NL*
shall
compel
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reason
will
compel
your
worship
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
and
if
it
has
no
power
*NL*
over
you
,
it
has
power
over
us
,
to
make
us
do
what
we
came
for
,
and
what
*NL*
it
is
our
duty
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
hear
what
the
whole
affair
is
about
,
''
said
the
Judge
at
this
;
but
*NL*
the
man
,
who
knew
him
as
a
neighbour
of
theirs
,
replied
,
``
Do
you
not
know
*NL*
this
gentleman
,
Senor
Judge
?
He
is
the
son
of
your
neighbour
,
who
has
run
*NL*
away
from
his
father
's
house
in
a
dress
so
unbecoming
his
rank
,
as
your
*NL*
worship
may
perceive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
on
this
looked
at
him
more
carefully
and
recognised
him
,
and
*NL*
embracing
him
said
,
``
What
folly
is
this
,
Senor
Don
Luis
,
or
what
can
have
*NL*
been
the
cause
that
could
have
induced
you
to
come
here
in
this
way
,
and
*NL*
in
this
dress
,
which
so
ill
becomes
your
condition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
came
into
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
,
and
he
was
unable
to
utter
a
*NL*
word
in
reply
to
the
Judge
,
who
told
the
four
servants
not
to
be
uneasy
,
*NL*
for
all
would
be
satisfactorily
settled
;
and
then
taking
Don
Luis
by
the
*NL*
hand
,
he
drew
him
aside
and
asked
the
reason
of
his
having
come
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
he
was
questioning
him
they
heard
a
loud
outcry
at
the
gate
of
*NL*
the
inn
,
the
cause
of
which
was
that
two
of
the
guests
who
had
passed
the
*NL*
night
there
,
seeing
everybody
busy
about
finding
out
what
it
was
the
four
*NL*
men
wanted
,
had
conceived
the
idea
of
going
off
without
paying
what
they
*NL*
owed
;
but
the
landlord
,
who
minded
his
own
affairs
more
than
other
*NL*
people
's
,
caught
them
going
out
of
the
gate
and
demanded
his
reckoning
,
*NL*
abusing
them
for
their
dishonesty
with
such
language
that
he
drove
them
*NL*
to
reply
with
their
fists
,
and
so
they
began
to
lay
on
him
in
such
a
*NL*
style
that
the
poor
man
was
forced
to
cry
out
,
and
call
for
help
.
The
*NL*
landlady
and
her
daughter
could
see
no
one
more
free
to
give
aid
than
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
and
to
him
the
daughter
said
,
``
Sir
knight
,
by
the
virtue
God
has
*NL*
given
you
,
help
my
poor
father
,
for
two
wicked
men
are
beating
him
to
a
*NL*
mummy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
very
deliberately
and
phlegmatically
replied
,
``
Fair
*NL*
damsel
,
at
the
present
moment
your
request
is
inopportune
,
for
I
am
*NL*
debarred
from
involving
myself
in
any
adventure
until
I
have
brought
to
a
*NL*
happy
conclusion
one
to
which
my
word
has
pledged
me
;
but
that
which
I
*NL*
can
do
for
you
is
what
I
will
now
mention
:
run
and
tell
your
father
to
*NL*
stand
his
ground
as
well
as
he
can
in
this
battle
,
and
on
no
account
to
*NL*
allow
himself
to
be
vanquished
,
while
I
go
and
request
permission
of
the
*NL*
Princess
Micomicona
to
enable
me
to
succour
him
in
his
distress
;
and
if
*NL*
she
grants
it
,
rest
assured
I
will
relieve
him
from
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sinner
that
I
am
,
''
exclaimed
Maritornes
,
who
stood
by
;
``
before
you
have
*NL*
got
your
permission
my
master
will
be
in
the
other
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
leave
,
senora
,
to
obtain
the
permission
I
speak
of
,
''
returned
*NL*
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
if
I
get
it
,
it
will
matter
very
little
if
he
is
in
the
*NL*
other
world
;
for
I
will
rescue
him
thence
in
spite
of
all
the
same
world
*NL*
can
do
;
or
at
any
rate
I
will
give
you
such
a
revenge
over
those
who
*NL*
shall
have
sent
him
there
that
you
will
be
more
than
moderately
*NL*
satisfied
;
''
and
without
saying
anything
more
he
went
and
knelt
before
*NL*
Dorothea
,
requesting
her
Highness
in
knightly
and
errant
phrase
to
be
*NL*
pleased
to
grant
him
permission
to
aid
and
succour
the
castellan
of
that
*NL*
castle
,
who
now
stood
in
grievous
jeopardy
.
The
princess
granted
it
*NL*
graciously
,
and
he
at
once
,
bracing
his
buckler
on
his
arm
and
drawing
*NL*
his
sword
,
hastened
to
the
inn-gate
,
where
the
two
guests
were
still
*NL*
handling
the
landlord
roughly
;
but
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
spot
he
*NL*
stopped
short
and
stood
still
,
though
Maritornes
and
the
landlady
asked
*NL*
him
why
he
hesitated
to
help
their
master
and
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hesitate
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
because
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
to
draw
*NL*
sword
against
persons
of
squirely
condition
;
but
call
my
squire
Sancho
to
*NL*
me
;
for
this
defence
and
vengeance
are
his
affair
and
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
matters
stood
at
the
inn-gate
,
where
there
was
a
very
lively
*NL*
exchange
of
fisticuffs
and
punches
,
to
the
sore
damage
of
the
landlord
*NL*
and
to
the
wrath
of
Maritornes
,
the
landlady
,
and
her
daughter
,
who
were
*NL*
furious
when
they
saw
the
pusillanimity
of
Don
Quixote
,
and
the
hard
*NL*
treatment
their
master
,
husband
and
father
was
undergoing
.
But
let
us
*NL*
leave
him
there
;
for
he
will
surely
find
some
one
to
help
him
,
and
if
*NL*
not
,
let
him
suffer
and
hold
his
tongue
who
attempts
more
than
his
*NL*
strength
allows
him
to
do
;
and
let
us
go
back
fifty
paces
to
see
what
Don
*NL*
Luis
said
in
reply
to
the
Judge
whom
we
left
questioning
him
privately
as
*NL*
to
his
reasons
for
coming
on
foot
and
so
meanly
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
youth
,
pressing
his
hand
in
a
way
that
showed
his
heart
was
*NL*
troubled
by
some
great
sorrow
,
and
shedding
a
flood
of
tears
,
made
*NL*
answer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
I
have
no
more
to
tell
you
than
that
from
the
moment
when
,
*NL*
through
heaven
's
will
and
our
being
near
neighbours
,
I
first
saw
Dona
*NL*
Clara
,
your
daughter
and
my
lady
,
from
that
instant
I
made
her
the
*NL*
mistress
of
my
will
,
and
if
yours
,
my
true
lord
and
father
,
offers
no
*NL*
impediment
,
this
very
day
she
shall
become
my
wife
.
For
her
I
left
my
*NL*
father
's
house
,
and
for
her
I
assumed
this
disguise
,
to
follow
her
*NL*
whithersoever
she
may
go
,
as
the
arrow
seeks
its
mark
or
the
sailor
the
*NL*
pole-star
.
She
knows
nothing
more
of
my
passion
than
what
she
may
have
*NL*
learned
from
having
sometimes
seen
from
a
distance
that
my
eyes
were
*NL*
filled
with
tears
.
You
know
already
,
senor
,
the
wealth
and
noble
birth
of
*NL*
my
parents
,
and
that
I
am
their
sole
heir
;
if
this
be
a
sufficient
*NL*
inducement
for
you
to
venture
to
make
me
completely
happy
,
accept
me
at
*NL*
once
as
your
son
;
for
if
my
father
,
influenced
by
other
objects
of
his
*NL*
own
,
should
disapprove
of
this
happiness
I
have
sought
for
myself
,
time
*NL*
has
more
power
to
alter
and
change
things
,
than
human
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
the
love-smitten
youth
was
silent
,
while
the
Judge
,
after
*NL*
hearing
him
,
was
astonished
,
perplexed
,
and
surprised
,
as
well
at
the
*NL*
manner
and
intelligence
with
which
Don
Luis
had
confessed
the
secret
of
*NL*
his
heart
,
as
at
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
,
not
knowing
what
*NL*
course
to
take
in
a
matter
so
sudden
and
unexpected
.
All
the
answer
,
*NL*
therefore
,
he
gave
him
was
to
bid
him
to
make
his
mind
easy
for
the
*NL*
present
,
and
arrange
with
his
servants
not
to
take
him
back
that
day
,
so
*NL*
that
there
might
be
time
to
consider
what
was
best
for
all
parties
.
Don
*NL*
Luis
kissed
his
hands
by
force
,
nay
,
bathed
them
with
his
tears
,
in
a
way
*NL*
that
would
have
touched
a
heart
of
marble
,
not
to
say
that
of
the
Judge
,
*NL*
who
,
as
a
shrewd
man
,
had
already
perceived
how
advantageous
the
marriage
*NL*
would
be
to
his
daughter
;
though
,
were
it
possible
,
he
would
have
*NL*
preferred
that
it
should
be
brought
about
with
the
consent
of
the
father
*NL*
of
Don
Luis
,
who
he
knew
looked
for
a
title
for
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
had
by
this
time
made
peace
with
the
landlord
,
for
,
by
*NL*
persuasion
and
Don
Quixote
's
fair
words
more
than
by
threats
,
they
had
*NL*
paid
him
what
he
demanded
,
and
the
servants
of
Don
Luis
were
waiting
for
*NL*
the
end
of
the
conversation
with
the
Judge
and
their
master
's
decision
,
*NL*
when
the
devil
,
who
never
sleeps
,
contrived
that
the
barber
,
from
whom
*NL*
Don
Quixote
had
taken
Mambrino
's
helmet
,
and
Sancho
Panza
the
trappings
*NL*
of
his
ass
in
exchange
for
those
of
his
own
,
should
at
this
instant
enter
*NL*
the
inn
;
which
said
barber
,
as
he
led
his
ass
to
the
stable
,
observed
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
engaged
in
repairing
something
or
other
belonging
to
the
*NL*
pack-saddle
;
and
the
moment
he
saw
it
he
knew
it
,
and
made
bold
to
attack
*NL*
Sancho
,
exclaiming
,
``
Ho
,
sir
thief
,
I
have
caught
you
!
hand
over
my
basin
*NL*
and
my
pack-saddle
,
and
all
my
trappings
that
you
robbed
me
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
finding
himself
so
unexpectedly
assailed
,
and
hearing
the
abuse
*NL*
poured
upon
him
,
seized
the
pack-saddle
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
*NL*
gave
the
barber
a
cuff
that
bathed
his
teeth
in
blood
.
The
barber
,
*NL*
however
,
was
not
so
ready
to
relinquish
the
prize
he
had
made
in
the
*NL*
pack-saddle
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
raised
such
an
outcry
that
everyone
in
*NL*
the
inn
came
running
to
know
what
the
noise
and
quarrel
meant
.
``
Here
,
in
*NL*
the
name
of
the
king
and
justice
!
''
he
cried
,
``
this
thief
and
highwayman
*NL*
wants
to
kill
me
for
trying
to
recover
my
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
lie
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
am
no
highwayman
;
it
was
in
fair
war
my
master
*NL*
Don
Quixote
won
these
spoils
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
standing
by
at
the
time
,
highly
pleased
to
see
his
*NL*
squire
's
stoutness
,
both
offensive
and
defensive
,
and
from
that
time
*NL*
forth
he
reckoned
him
a
man
of
mettle
,
and
in
his
heart
resolved
to
dub
*NL*
him
a
knight
on
the
first
opportunity
that
presented
itself
,
feeling
sure
*NL*
that
the
order
of
chivalry
would
be
fittingly
bestowed
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
the
altercation
,
among
other
things
the
barber
said
,
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
this
pack-saddle
is
mine
as
surely
as
I
owe
God
a
death
,
and
*NL*
I
know
it
as
well
as
if
I
had
given
birth
to
it
,
and
here
is
my
ass
in
*NL*
the
stable
who
will
not
let
me
lie
;
only
try
it
,
and
if
it
does
not
fit
*NL*
him
like
a
glove
,
call
me
a
rascal
;
and
what
is
more
,
the
same
day
I
was
*NL*
robbed
of
this
,
they
robbed
me
likewise
of
a
new
brass
basin
,
never
yet
*NL*
handselled
,
that
would
fetch
a
crown
any
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Don
Quixote
could
not
keep
himself
from
answering
;
and
*NL*
interposing
between
the
two
,
and
separating
them
,
he
placed
the
*NL*
pack-saddle
on
the
ground
,
to
lie
there
in
sight
until
the
truth
was
*NL*
established
,
and
said
,
``
Your
worships
may
perceive
clearly
and
plainly
*NL*
the
error
under
which
this
worthy
squire
lies
when
he
calls
a
basin
which
*NL*
was
,
is
,
and
shall
be
the
helmet
of
Mambrino
which
I
won
from
him
in
fair
*NL*
war
,
and
made
myself
master
of
by
legitimate
and
lawful
possession
.
With
*NL*
the
pack-saddle
I
do
not
concern
myself
;
but
I
may
tell
you
on
that
head
*NL*
that
my
squire
Sancho
asked
my
permission
to
strip
off
the
caparison
of
*NL*
this
vanquished
poltroon
's
steed
,
and
with
it
adorn
his
own
;
I
allowed
*NL*
him
,
and
he
took
it
;
and
as
to
its
having
been
changed
from
a
caparison
*NL*
into
a
pack-saddle
,
I
can
give
no
explanation
except
the
usual
one
,
that
*NL*
such
transformations
will
take
place
in
adventures
of
chivalry
.
To
*NL*
confirm
all
which
,
run
,
Sancho
my
son
,
and
fetch
hither
the
helmet
which
*NL*
this
good
fellow
calls
a
basin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Egad
,
master
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
if
we
have
no
other
proof
of
our
case
than
*NL*
what
your
worship
puts
forward
,
Mambrino
's
helmet
is
just
as
much
a
basin
*NL*
as
this
good
fellow
's
caparison
is
a
pack-saddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
I
bid
thee
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
it
can
not
be
that
everything
in
*NL*
this
castle
goes
by
enchantment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
hastened
to
where
the
basin
was
,
and
brought
it
back
with
him
,
and
*NL*
when
Don
Quixote
saw
it
,
he
took
hold
of
it
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worships
may
see
with
what
a
face
this
squire
can
assert
that
this
*NL*
is
a
basin
and
not
the
helmet
I
told
you
of
;
and
I
swear
by
the
order
of
*NL*
chivalry
I
profess
,
that
this
helmet
is
the
identical
one
I
took
from
*NL*
him
,
without
anything
added
to
or
taken
from
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
doubt
of
that
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
from
the
time
my
master
*NL*
won
it
until
now
he
has
only
fought
one
battle
in
it
,
when
he
let
loose
*NL*
those
unlucky
men
in
chains
;
and
if
had
not
been
for
this
basin-helmet
he
*NL*
would
not
have
come
off
over
well
that
time
,
for
there
was
plenty
of
*NL*
stone-throwing
in
that
affair

CHAPTER
XLV
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
THE
DOUBTFUL
QUESTION
OF
MAMBRINO
'S
HELMET
AND
THE
PACK-SADDLE
*NL*
IS
FINALLY
SETTLED
,
WITH
OTHER
ADVENTURES
THAT
OCCURRED
IN
TRUTH
AND
*NL*
EARNEST
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
now
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
of
what
these
*NL*
gentles
say
,
when
they
want
to
make
out
that
this
is
a
helmet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whoever
says
the
contrary
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
will
let
him
know
*NL*
he
lies
if
he
is
a
knight
,
and
if
he
is
a
squire
that
he
lies
again
a
*NL*
thousand
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
own
barber
,
who
was
present
at
all
this
,
and
understood
Don
Quixote
's
*NL*
humour
so
thoroughly
,
took
it
into
his
head
to
back
up
his
delusion
and
*NL*
carry
on
the
joke
for
the
general
amusement
;
so
addressing
the
other
*NL*
barber
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
barber
,
or
whatever
you
are
,
you
must
know
that
I
belong
to
your
*NL*
profession
too
,
and
have
had
a
licence
to
practise
for
more
than
twenty
*NL*
years
,
and
I
know
the
implements
of
the
barber
craft
,
every
one
of
them
,
*NL*
perfectly
well
;
and
I
was
likewise
a
soldier
for
some
time
in
the
days
of
*NL*
my
youth
,
and
I
know
also
what
a
helmet
is
,
and
a
morion
,
and
a
headpiece
*NL*
with
a
visor
,
and
other
things
pertaining
to
soldiering
,
I
meant
to
say
*NL*
to
soldiers
'
arms
;
and
I
say-saving
better
opinions
and
always
with
*NL*
submission
to
sounder
judgments
--
that
this
piece
we
have
now
before
us
,
*NL*
which
this
worthy
gentleman
has
in
his
hands
,
not
only
is
no
barber
's
*NL*
basin
,
but
is
as
far
from
being
one
as
white
is
from
black
,
and
truth
*NL*
from
falsehood
;
I
say
,
moreover
,
that
this
,
although
it
is
a
helmet
,
is
*NL*
not
a
complete
helmet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
half
of
it
is
wanting
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
the
beaver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
true
,
''
said
the
curate
,
who
saw
the
object
of
his
friend
the
*NL*
barber
;
and
Cardenio
,
Don
Fernando
and
his
companions
agreed
with
him
,
*NL*
and
even
the
Judge
,
if
his
thoughts
had
not
been
so
full
of
Don
Luis
's
*NL*
affair
,
would
have
helped
to
carry
on
the
joke
;
but
he
was
so
taken
up
*NL*
with
the
serious
matters
he
had
on
his
mind
that
he
paid
little
or
no
*NL*
attention
to
these
facetious
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
me
!
''
exclaimed
their
butt
the
barber
at
this
;
``
is
it
possible
*NL*
that
such
an
honourable
company
can
say
that
this
is
not
a
basin
but
a
*NL*
helmet
?
Why
,
this
is
a
thing
that
would
astonish
a
whole
university
,
*NL*
however
wise
it
might
be
!
That
will
do
;
if
this
basin
is
a
helmet
,
why
,
*NL*
then
the
pack-saddle
must
be
a
horse
's
caparison
,
as
this
gentleman
has
*NL*
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
it
looks
like
a
pack-saddle
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
I
have
*NL*
already
said
that
with
that
question
I
do
not
concern
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
whether
it
be
pack-saddle
or
caparison
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
it
is
*NL*
only
for
Senor
Don
Quixote
to
say
;
for
in
these
matters
of
chivalry
all
*NL*
these
gentlemen
and
I
bow
to
his
authority
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
so
many
strange
things
have
*NL*
happened
to
me
in
this
castle
on
the
two
occasions
on
which
I
have
*NL*
sojourned
in
it
,
that
I
will
not
venture
to
assert
anything
positively
in
*NL*
reply
to
any
question
touching
anything
it
contains
;
for
it
is
my
belief
*NL*
that
everything
that
goes
on
within
it
goes
by
enchantment
.
The
first
*NL*
time
,
an
enchanted
Moor
that
there
is
in
it
gave
me
sore
trouble
,
nor
did
*NL*
Sancho
fare
well
among
certain
followers
of
his
;
and
last
night
I
was
*NL*
kept
hanging
by
this
arm
for
nearly
two
hours
,
without
knowing
how
or
why
*NL*
I
came
by
such
a
mishap
.
So
that
now
,
for
me
to
come
forward
to
give
an
*NL*
opinion
in
such
a
puzzling
matter
,
would
be
to
risk
a
rash
decision
.
As
*NL*
regards
the
assertion
that
this
is
a
basin
and
not
a
helmet
I
have
*NL*
already
given
an
answer
;
but
as
to
the
question
whether
this
is
a
*NL*
pack-saddle
or
a
caparison
I
will
not
venture
to
give
a
positive
opinion
,
*NL*
but
will
leave
it
to
your
worships
'
better
judgment
.
Perhaps
as
you
are
*NL*
not
dubbed
knights
like
myself
,
the
enchantments
of
this
place
have
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
you
,
and
your
faculties
are
unfettered
,
and
you
can
*NL*
see
things
in
this
castle
as
they
really
and
truly
are
,
and
not
as
they
*NL*
appear
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
can
be
no
question
,
''
said
Don
Fernando
on
this
,
``
but
that
Senor
*NL*
Don
Quixote
has
spoken
very
wisely
,
and
that
with
us
rests
the
decision
*NL*
of
this
matter
;
and
that
we
may
have
surer
ground
to
go
on
,
I
will
take
*NL*
the
votes
of
the
gentlemen
in
secret
,
and
declare
the
result
clearly
and
*NL*
fully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
those
who
were
in
the
secret
of
Don
Quixote
's
humour
all
this
afforded
*NL*
great
amusement
;
but
to
those
who
knew
nothing
about
it
,
it
seemed
the
*NL*
greatest
nonsense
in
the
world
,
in
particular
to
the
four
servants
of
Don
*NL*
Luis
,
as
well
as
to
Don
Luis
himself
,
and
to
three
other
travellers
who
*NL*
had
by
chance
come
to
the
inn
,
and
had
the
appearance
of
officers
of
the
*NL*
Holy
Brotherhood
,
as
indeed
they
were
;
but
the
one
who
above
all
was
at
*NL*
his
wits
'
end
,
was
the
barber
whose
basin
,
there
before
his
very
eyes
,
had
been
*NL*
turned
into
Mambrino
's
helmet
,
and
whose
pack-saddle
he
had
no
doubt
*NL*
whatever
was
about
to
become
a
rich
caparison
for
a
horse
.
All
laughed
to
*NL*
see
Don
Fernando
going
from
one
to
another
collecting
the
votes
,
and
*NL*
whispering
to
them
to
give
him
their
private
opinion
whether
the
treasure
*NL*
over
which
there
had
been
so
much
fighting
was
a
pack-saddle
or
a
*NL*
caparison
;
but
after
he
had
taken
the
votes
of
those
who
knew
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
he
said
aloud
,
``
The
fact
is
,
my
good
fellow
,
that
I
am
tired
*NL*
collecting
such
a
number
of
opinions
,
for
I
find
that
there
is
not
one
of
*NL*
whom
I
ask
what
I
desire
to
know
,
who
does
not
tell
me
that
it
is
absurd
*NL*
to
say
that
this
is
the
pack-saddle
of
an
ass
,
and
not
the
caparison
of
a
*NL*
horse
,
nay
,
of
a
thoroughbred
horse
;
so
you
must
submit
,
for
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
you
and
your
ass
,
this
is
a
caparison
and
no
pack-saddle
,
and
you
have
*NL*
stated
and
proved
your
case
very
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
never
share
heaven
,
''
said
the
poor
barber
,
``
if
your
worships
are
*NL*
not
all
mistaken
;
and
may
my
soul
appear
before
God
as
that
appears
to
me
*NL*
a
pack-saddle
and
not
a
caparison
;
but
,
`
laws
go
,
'
-
I
say
no
more
;
and
*NL*
indeed
I
am
not
drunk
,
for
I
am
fasting
,
except
it
be
from
sin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
simple
talk
of
the
barber
did
not
afford
less
amusement
than
the
*NL*
absurdities
of
Don
Quixote
,
who
now
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
more
to
be
done
now
than
for
each
to
take
what
belongs
to
*NL*
him
,
and
to
whom
God
has
given
it
,
may
St.
Peter
add
his
blessing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
said
one
of
the
four
servants
,
``
Unless
,
indeed
,
this
is
a
deliberate
*NL*
joke
,
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
men
so
intelligent
as
those
*NL*
present
are
,
or
seem
to
be
,
can
venture
to
declare
and
assert
that
this
*NL*
is
not
a
basin
,
and
that
not
a
pack-saddle
;
but
as
I
perceive
that
they
*NL*
do
assert
and
declare
it
,
I
can
only
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
*NL*
some
mystery
in
this
persistence
in
what
is
so
opposed
to
the
evidence
of
*NL*
experience
and
truth
itself
;
for
I
swear
by
''
--
and
here
he
rapped
out
a
*NL*
round
oath
-
``
all
the
people
in
the
world
will
not
make
me
believe
that
*NL*
this
is
not
a
barber
's
basin
and
that
a
jackass
's
pack-saddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
easily
be
a
she-ass
's
,
''
observed
the
curate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
the
same
,
''
said
the
servant
;
``
that
is
not
the
point
;
but
*NL*
whether
it
is
or
is
not
a
pack-saddle
,
as
your
worships
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
one
of
the
newly
arrived
officers
of
the
Brotherhood
,
who
*NL*
had
been
listening
to
the
dispute
and
controversy
,
unable
to
restrain
his
*NL*
anger
and
impatience
,
exclaimed
,
``
It
is
a
pack-saddle
as
sure
as
my
*NL*
father
is
my
father
,
and
whoever
has
said
or
will
say
anything
else
must
*NL*
be
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
lie
like
a
rascally
clown
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
;
and
lifting
his
*NL*
pike
,
which
he
had
never
let
out
of
his
hand
,
he
delivered
such
a
blow
at
*NL*
his
head
that
,
had
not
the
officer
dodged
it
,
it
would
have
stretched
him
*NL*
at
full
length
.
The
pike
was
shivered
in
pieces
against
the
ground
,
and
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
officers
,
seeing
their
comrade
assaulted
,
raised
a
shout
,
*NL*
calling
for
help
for
the
Holy
Brotherhood
.
The
landlord
,
who
was
of
the
*NL*
fraternity
,
ran
at
once
to
fetch
his
staff
of
office
and
his
sword
,
and
*NL*
ranged
himself
on
the
side
of
his
comrades
;
the
servants
of
Don
Luis
*NL*
clustered
round
him
,
lest
he
should
escape
from
them
in
the
confusion
;
*NL*
the
barber
,
seeing
the
house
turned
upside
down
,
once
more
laid
hold
of
*NL*
his
pack-saddle
and
Sancho
did
the
same
;
Don
Quixote
drew
his
sword
and
*NL*
charged
the
officers
;
Don
Luis
cried
out
to
his
servants
to
leave
him
*NL*
alone
and
go
and
help
Don
Quixote
,
and
Cardenio
and
Don
Fernando
,
who
*NL*
were
supporting
him
;
the
curate
was
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
the
*NL*
landlady
was
screaming
,
her
daughter
was
wailing
,
Maritornes
was
weeping
,
*NL*
Dorothea
was
aghast
,
Luscinda
terror-stricken
,
and
Dona
Clara
in
a
faint
.
*NL*
The
barber
cudgelled
Sancho
,
and
Sancho
pommelled
the
barber
;
Don
Luis
*NL*
gave
one
of
his
servants
,
who
ventured
to
catch
him
by
the
arm
to
keep
*NL*
him
from
escaping
,
a
cuff
that
bathed
his
teeth
in
blood
;
the
Judge
took
*NL*
his
part
;
Don
Fernando
had
got
one
of
the
officers
down
and
was
*NL*
belabouring
him
heartily
;
the
landlord
raised
his
voice
again
calling
for
*NL*
help
for
the
Holy
Brotherhood
;
so
that
the
whole
inn
was
nothing
but
*NL*
cries
,
shouts
,
shrieks
,
confusion
,
terror
,
dismay
,
mishaps
,
sword-cuts
,
*NL*
fisticuffs
,
cudgellings
,
kicks
,
and
bloodshed
;
and
in
the
midst
of
all
*NL*
this
chaos
,
complication
,
and
general
entanglement
,
Don
Quixote
took
it
*NL*
into
his
head
that
he
had
been
plunged
into
the
thick
of
the
discord
of
*NL*
Agramante
's
camp
;
and
,
in
a
voice
that
shook
the
inn
like
thunder
,
he
*NL*
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
all
,
let
all
sheathe
their
swords
,
let
all
be
calm
and
attend
to
me
*NL*
as
they
value
their
lives
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
paused
at
his
mighty
voice
,
and
he
went
on
to
say
,
``
Did
I
not
tell
*NL*
you
,
sirs
,
that
this
castle
was
enchanted
,
and
that
a
legion
or
so
of
*NL*
devils
dwelt
in
it
?
In
proof
whereof
I
call
upon
you
to
behold
with
your
*NL*
own
eyes
how
the
discord
of
Agramante
's
camp
has
come
hither
,
and
been
*NL*
transferred
into
the
midst
of
us
.
See
how
they
fight
,
there
for
the
*NL*
sword
,
here
for
the
horse
,
on
that
side
for
the
eagle
,
on
this
for
the
*NL*
helmet
;
we
are
all
fighting
,
and
all
at
cross
purposes
.
Come
then
,
you
,
*NL*
Senor
Judge
,
and
you
,
senor
curate
;
let
the
one
represent
King
Agramante
*NL*
and
the
other
King
Sobrino
,
and
make
peace
among
us
;
for
by
God
Almighty
*NL*
it
is
a
sorry
business
that
so
many
persons
of
quality
as
we
are
should
*NL*
slay
one
another
for
such
trifling
cause
.
''
The
officers
,
who
did
not
*NL*
understand
Don
Quixote
's
mode
of
speaking
,
and
found
themselves
roughly
*NL*
handled
by
Don
Fernando
,
Cardenio
,
and
their
companions
,
were
not
to
be
*NL*
appeased
;
the
barber
was
,
however
,
for
both
his
beard
and
his
pack-saddle
*NL*
were
the
worse
for
the
struggle
;
Sancho
like
a
good
servant
obeyed
the
*NL*
slightest
word
of
his
master
;
while
the
four
servants
of
Don
Luis
kept
*NL*
quiet
when
they
saw
how
little
they
gained
by
not
being
so
.
The
landlord
*NL*
alone
insisted
upon
it
that
they
must
punish
the
insolence
of
this
*NL*
madman
,
who
at
every
turn
raised
a
disturbance
in
the
inn
;
but
at
length
*NL*
the
uproar
was
stilled
for
the
present
;
the
pack-saddle
remained
a
*NL*
caparison
till
the
day
of
judgment
,
and
the
basin
a
helmet
and
the
inn
a
*NL*
castle
in
Don
Quixote
's
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
having
been
now
pacified
and
made
friends
by
the
persuasion
of
the
*NL*
Judge
and
the
curate
,
the
servants
of
Don
Luis
began
again
to
urge
him
to
*NL*
return
with
them
at
once
;
and
while
he
was
discussing
the
matter
with
*NL*
them
,
the
Judge
took
counsel
with
Don
Fernando
,
Cardenio
,
and
the
curate
*NL*
as
to
what
he
ought
to
do
in
the
case
,
telling
them
how
it
stood
,
and
*NL*
what
Don
Luis
had
said
to
him
.
It
was
agreed
at
length
that
Don
Fernando
*NL*
should
tell
the
servants
of
Don
Luis
who
he
was
,
and
that
it
was
his
*NL*
desire
that
Don
Luis
should
accompany
him
to
Andalusia
,
where
he
would
*NL*
receive
from
the
marquis
his
brother
the
welcome
his
quality
entitled
him
*NL*
to
;
for
,
otherwise
,
it
was
easy
to
see
from
the
determination
of
Don
Luis
*NL*
that
he
would
not
return
to
his
father
at
present
,
though
they
tore
him
*NL*
to
pieces
.
On
learning
the
rank
of
Don
Fernando
and
the
resolution
of
Don
*NL*
Luis
the
four
then
settled
it
between
themselves
that
three
of
them
*NL*
should
return
to
tell
his
father
how
matters
stood
,
and
that
the
other
*NL*
should
remain
to
wait
upon
Don
Luis
,
and
not
leave
him
until
they
came
*NL*
back
for
him
,
or
his
father
's
orders
were
known
.
Thus
by
the
authority
of
*NL*
Agramante
and
the
wisdom
of
King
Sobrino
all
this
complication
of
*NL*
disputes
was
arranged
;
but
the
enemy
of
concord
and
hater
of
peace
,
*NL*
feeling
himself
slighted
and
made
a
fool
of
,
and
seeing
how
little
he
had
*NL*
gained
after
having
involved
them
all
in
such
an
elaborate
entanglement
,
*NL*
resolved
to
try
his
hand
once
more
by
stirring
up
fresh
quarrels
and
*NL*
disturbances
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
about
in
this
wise
:
the
officers
were
pacified
on
learning
the
*NL*
rank
of
those
with
whom
they
had
been
engaged
,
and
withdrew
from
the
*NL*
contest
,
considering
that
whatever
the
result
might
be
they
were
likely
*NL*
to
get
the
worst
of
the
battle
;
but
one
of
them
,
the
one
who
had
been
*NL*
thrashed
and
kicked
by
Don
Fernando
,
recollected
that
among
some
warrants
*NL*
he
carried
for
the
arrest
of
certain
delinquents
,
he
had
one
against
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
whom
the
Holy
Brotherhood
had
ordered
to
be
arrested
for
setting
*NL*
the
galley
slaves
free
,
as
Sancho
had
,
with
very
good
reason
,
*NL*
apprehended
.
Suspecting
how
it
was
,
then
,
he
wished
to
satisfy
himself
as
*NL*
to
whether
Don
Quixote
's
features
corresponded
;
and
taking
a
parchment
*NL*
out
of
his
bosom
he
lit
upon
what
he
was
in
search
of
,
and
setting
*NL*
himself
to
read
it
deliberately
,
for
he
was
not
a
quick
reader
,
as
he
*NL*
made
out
each
word
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
Don
Quixote
,
and
went
on
*NL*
comparing
the
description
in
the
warrant
with
his
face
,
and
discovered
*NL*
that
beyond
all
doubt
he
was
the
person
described
in
it
.
As
soon
as
he
*NL*
had
satisfied
himself
,
folding
up
the
parchment
,
he
took
the
warrant
in
*NL*
his
left
hand
and
with
his
right
seized
Don
Quixote
by
the
collar
so
*NL*
tightly
that
he
did
not
allow
him
to
breathe
,
and
shouted
aloud
,
``
Help
*NL*
for
the
Holy
Brotherhood
!
and
that
you
may
see
I
demand
it
in
earnest
,
*NL*
read
this
warrant
which
says
this
highwayman
is
to
be
arrested
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
took
the
warrant
and
saw
that
what
the
officer
said
was
true
,
*NL*
and
that
it
agreed
with
Don
Quixote
's
appearance
,
who
,
on
his
part
,
when
*NL*
he
found
himself
roughly
handled
by
this
rascally
clown
,
worked
up
to
the
*NL*
highest
pitch
of
wrath
,
and
all
his
joints
cracking
with
rage
,
with
both
*NL*
hands
seized
the
officer
by
the
throat
with
all
his
might
,
so
that
had
he
*NL*
not
been
helped
by
his
comrades
he
would
have
yielded
up
his
life
ere
Don
*NL*
Quixote
released
his
hold
.
The
landlord
,
who
had
perforce
to
support
his
*NL*
brother
officers
,
ran
at
once
to
aid
them
.
The
landlady
,
when
she
saw
her
*NL*
husband
engaged
in
a
fresh
quarrel
,
lifted
up
her
voice
afresh
,
and
its
*NL*
note
was
immediately
caught
up
by
Maritornes
and
her
daughter
,
calling
*NL*
upon
heaven
and
all
present
for
help
;
and
Sancho
,
seeing
what
was
going
*NL*
on
,
exclaimed
,
``
By
the
Lord
,
it
is
quite
true
what
my
master
says
about
*NL*
the
enchantments
of
this
castle
,
for
it
is
impossible
to
live
an
hour
in
*NL*
peace
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Fernando
parted
the
officer
and
Don
Quixote
,
and
to
their
mutual
*NL*
contentment
made
them
relax
the
grip
by
which
they
held
,
the
one
the
coat
*NL*
collar
,
the
other
the
throat
of
his
adversary
;
for
all
this
,
however
,
the
*NL*
officers
did
not
cease
to
demand
their
prisoner
and
call
on
them
to
help
,
*NL*
and
deliver
him
over
bound
into
their
power
,
as
was
required
for
the
*NL*
service
of
the
King
and
of
the
Holy
Brotherhood
,
on
whose
behalf
they
*NL*
again
demanded
aid
and
assistance
to
effect
the
capture
of
this
robber
*NL*
and
footpad
of
the
highways
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
smiled
when
he
heard
these
words
,
and
said
very
calmly
,
``
Come
*NL*
now
,
base
,
ill-born
brood
;
call
ye
it
highway
robbery
to
give
freedom
to
*NL*
those
in
bondage
,
to
release
the
captives
,
to
succour
the
miserable
,
to
*NL*
raise
up
the
fallen
,
to
relieve
the
needy
?
Infamous
beings
,
who
by
your
*NL*
vile
grovelling
intellects
deserve
that
heaven
should
not
make
known
to
*NL*
you
the
virtue
that
lies
in
knight-errantry
,
or
show
you
the
sin
and
*NL*
ignorance
in
which
ye
lie
when
ye
refuse
to
respect
the
shadow
,
not
to
*NL*
say
the
presence
,
of
any
knight-errant
!
Come
now
;
band
,
not
of
officers
,
*NL*
but
of
thieves
;
footpads
with
the
licence
of
the
Holy
Brotherhood
;
tell
*NL*
me
who
was
the
ignoramus
who
signed
a
warrant
of
arrest
against
such
a
*NL*
knight
as
I
am
?
Who
was
he
that
did
not
know
that
knights-errant
are
*NL*
independent
of
all
jurisdictions
,
that
their
law
is
their
sword
,
their
*NL*
charter
their
prowess
,
and
their
edicts
their
will
?
Who
,
I
say
again
,
was
*NL*
the
fool
that
knows
not
that
there
are
no
letters
patent
of
nobility
that
*NL*
confer
such
privileges
or
exemptions
as
a
knight-errant
acquires
the
day
*NL*
he
is
dubbed
a
knight
,
and
devotes
himself
to
the
arduous
calling
of
*NL*
chivalry
?
What
knight-errant
ever
paid
poll-tax
,
duty
,
queen
's
pin-money
,
*NL*
king
's
dues
,
toll
or
ferry
?
What
tailor
ever
took
payment
of
him
for
*NL*
making
his
clothes
?
What
castellan
that
received
him
in
his
castle
ever
*NL*
made
him
pay
his
shot

What

did
not
seat
him
at

table
?
What

damsel
was
not
enamoured
of
him
and
did
not
yield
herself
up
wholly
to
*NL*
his
will

And

lastly

what
knight-errant
has
there
been

is

there

there
ever

single-handed

CHAPTER
XLVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
END
OF
THE
NOTABLE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
OFFICERS
OF
THE
HOLY
*NL*
BROTHERHOOD
;
AND
OF
THE
GREAT
FEROCITY
OF
OUR
WORTHY
KNIGHT
,
DON
QUIXOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Don
Quixote
was
talking
in
this
strain
,
the
curate
was
endeavouring
*NL*
to
persuade
the
officers
that
he
was
out
of
his
senses
,
as
they
might
*NL*
perceive
by
his
deeds
and
his
words
,
and
that
they
need
not
press
the
*NL*
matter
any
further
,
for
even
if
they
arrested
him
and
carried
him
off
,
*NL*
they
would
have
to
release
him
by-and-by
as
a
madman
;
to
which
the
holder
*NL*
of
the
warrant
replied
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
inquiring
into
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
madness
,
but
only
to
execute
his
superior
's
orders
,
and
that
*NL*
once
taken
they
might
let
him
go
three
hundred
times
if
they
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
you
must
not
take
him
away
this
time
,
*NL*
nor
will
he
,
it
is
my
opinion
,
let
himself
be
taken
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
the
curate
used
such
arguments
,
and
Don
Quixote
did
such
mad
*NL*
things
,
that
the
officers
would
have
been
more
mad
than
he
was
if
they
*NL*
had
not
perceived
his
want
of
wits
,
and
so
they
thought
it
best
to
allow
*NL*
themselves
to
be
pacified
,
and
even
to
act
as
peacemakers
between
the
*NL*
barber
and
Sancho
Panza
,
who
still
continued
their
altercation
with
much
*NL*
bitterness
.
In
the
end
they
,
as
officers
of
justice
,
settled
the
question
*NL*
by
arbitration
in
such
a
manner
that
both
sides
were
,
if
not
perfectly
*NL*
contented
,
at
least
to
some
extent
satisfied
;
for
they
changed
the
*NL*
pack-saddles
,
but
not
the
girths
or
head-stalls
;
and
as
to
Mambrino
's
*NL*
helmet
,
the
curate
,
under
the
rose
and
without
Don
Quixote
's
knowing
it
,
*NL*
paid
eight
reals
for
the
basin
,
and
the
barber
executed
a
full
receipt
*NL*
and
engagement
to
make
no
further
demand
then
or
thenceforth
for
*NL*
evermore
,
amen
.
These
two
disputes
,
which
were
the
most
important
and
*NL*
gravest
,
being
settled
,
it
only
remained
for
the
servants
of
Don
Luis
to
*NL*
consent
that
three
of
them
should
return
while
one
was
left
to
accompany
*NL*
him
whither
Don
Fernando
desired
to
take
him
;
and
good
luck
and
better
*NL*
fortune
,
having
already
begun
to
solve
difficulties
and
remove
*NL*
obstructions
in
favour
of
the
lovers
and
warriors
of
the
inn
,
were
*NL*
pleased
to
persevere
and
bring
everything
to
a
happy
issue
;
for
the
*NL*
servants
agreed
to
do
as
Don
Luis
wished
;
which
gave
Dona
Clara
such
*NL*
happiness
that
no
one
could
have
looked
into
her
face
just
then
without
*NL*
seeing
the
joy
of
her
heart
.
Zoraida
,
though
she
did
not
fully
comprehend
*NL*
all
she
saw
,
was
grave
or
gay
without
knowing
why
,
as
she
watched
and
*NL*
studied
the
various
countenances
,
but
particularly
her
Spaniard
's
,
whom
*NL*
she
followed
with
her
eyes
and
clung
to
with
her
soul
.
The
gift
and
*NL*
compensation
which
the
curate
gave
the
barber
had
not
escaped
the
*NL*
landlord
's
notice
,
and
he
demanded
Don
Quixote
's
reckoning
,
together
with
*NL*
the
amount
of
the
damage
to
his
wine-skins
,
and
the
loss
of
his
wine
,
*NL*
swearing
that
neither
Rocinante
nor
Sancho
's
ass
should
leave
the
inn
*NL*
until
he
had
been
paid
to
the
very
last
farthing
.
The
curate
settled
all
*NL*
amicably
,
and
Don
Fernando
paid
;
though
the
Judge
had
also
very
readily
*NL*
offered
to
pay
the
score
;
and
all
became
so
peaceful
and
quiet
that
the
*NL*
inn
no
longer
reminded
one
of
the
discord
of
Agramante
's
camp
,
as
Don
*NL*
Quixote
said
,
but
of
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
the
days
of
*NL*
Octavianus
:
for
all
which
it
was
the
universal
opinion
that
their
thanks
*NL*
were
due
to
the
great
zeal
and
eloquence
of
the
curate
,
and
to
the
*NL*
unexampled
generosity
of
Don
Fernando
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
himself
now
clear
and
quit
of
all
quarrels
,
his
squire
's
as
well
*NL*
as
his
own
,
Don
Quixote
considered
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
continue
*NL*
the
journey
he
had
begun
,
and
bring
to
a
close
that
great
adventure
for
*NL*
which
he
had
been
called
and
chosen
;
and
with
this
high
resolve
he
went
*NL*
and
knelt
before
Dorothea
,
who
,
however
,
would
not
allow
him
to
utter
a
*NL*
word
until
he
had
risen
;
so
to
obey
her
he
rose
,
and
said
,
``
It
is
a
*NL*
common
proverb
,
fair
lady
,
that
`
diligence
is
the
mother
of
good
*NL*
fortune
,
'
and
experience
has
often
shown
in
important
affairs
that
the
*NL*
earnestness
of
the
negotiator
brings
the
doubtful
case
to
a
successful
*NL*
termination
;
but
in
nothing
does
this
truth
show
itself
more
plainly
than
*NL*
in
war
,
where
quickness
and
activity
forestall
the
devices
of
the
enemy
,
*NL*
and
win
the
victory
before
the
foe
has
time
to
defend
himself
.
All
this
I
*NL*
say
,
exalted
and
esteemed
lady
,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
for
us
to
*NL*
remain
any
longer
in
this
castle
now
is
useless
,
and
may
be
injurious
to
*NL*
us
in
a
way
that
we
shall
find
out
some
day
;
for
who
knows
but
that
your
*NL*
enemy
the
giant
may
have
learned
by
means
of
secret
and
diligent
spies
*NL*
that
I
am
going
to
destroy
him
,
and
if
the
opportunity
be
given
him
he
*NL*
may
seize
it
to
fortify
himself
in
some
impregnable
castle
or
stronghold
,
*NL*
against
which
all
my
efforts
and
the
might
of
my
indefatigable
arm
may
*NL*
avail
but
little
?
Therefore
,
lady
,
let
us
,
as
I
say
,
forestall
his
*NL*
schemes
by
our
activity
,
and
let
us
depart
at
once
in
quest
of
fair
*NL*
fortune
;
for
your
highness
is
only
kept
from
enjoying
it
as
fully
as
you
*NL*
could
desire
by
my
delay
in
encountering
your
adversary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
held
his
peace
and
said
no
more
,
calmly
awaiting
the
reply
of
*NL*
the
beauteous
princess
,
who
,
with
commanding
dignity
and
in
a
style
*NL*
adapted
to
Don
Quixote
's
own
,
replied
to
him
in
these
words
,
``
I
give
you
*NL*
thanks
,
sir
knight
,
for
the
eagerness
you
,
like
a
good
knight
to
whom
it
*NL*
is
a
natural
obligation
to
succour
the
orphan
and
the
needy
,
display
to
*NL*
afford
me
aid
in
my
sore
trouble
;
and
heaven
grant
that
your
wishes
and
*NL*
mine
may
be
realised
,
so
that
you
may
see
that
there
are
women
in
this
*NL*
world
capable
of
gratitude
;
as
to
my
departure
,
let
it
be
forthwith
,
for
*NL*
I
have
no
will
but
yours
;
dispose
of
me
entirely
in
accordance
with
your
*NL*
good
pleasure
;
for
she
who
has
once
entrusted
to
you
the
defence
of
her
*NL*
person
,
and
placed
in
your
hands
the
recovery
of
her
dominions
,
must
not
*NL*
think
of
offering
opposition
to
that
which
your
wisdom
may
ordain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
,
then
,
in
God
's
name
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
,
when
a
lady
humbles
*NL*
herself
to
me
,
I
will
not
lose
the
opportunity
of
raising
her
up
and
*NL*
placing
her
on
the
throne
of
her
ancestors

Let
us
depart
at
once
,
for
*NL*
the
common
saying
that
in
delay
there
is
danger
,
lends
spurs
to
my
*NL*
eagerness
to
take
the
road
;
and
as
neither
heaven
has
created
nor
hell
*NL*
seen
any
that
can
daunt
or
intimidate
me

saddle
Rocinante
,
Sancho

*NL*
get
ready
thy
ass

the
queen

palfrey

and
let
us
take
leave
of
the
*NL*
castellan
and
these
gentlemen
,
and
go
hence
this
very
instant

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
who
was
standing
by
all
the
time
,
said
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
Ah
!
*NL*
master
,
master
,
there
is
more
mischief
in
the
village
than
one
hears
of
,
*NL*
begging
all
good
bodies

pardon
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
mischief
can
there
be
in
any
village
,

in
all
the
cities
of
the
*NL*
world
,
you
booby
,
that
can
hurt
my
reputation

said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
worship
is
angry

replied
Sancho
,
``
I
will
hold
my
tongue
and
*NL*
leave
unsaid
what
as
a
good
squire
I
am
bound
to
say
,
and
what
a
good
*NL*
servant
should
tell
his
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
what
thou
wilt
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
provided
thy
words
be
not
*NL*
meant
to
work
upon
my
fears
;
for
thou
,
if
thou
fearest
,
art
behaving
like
*NL*
thyself
;
but
I
like
myself
,
in
not
fearing
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nothing
of
the
sort
,
as
I
am
a
sinner
before
God
,
''
said
Sancho
,
*NL*
``
but
that
I
take
it
to
be
sure
and
certain
that
this
lady
,
who
calls
*NL*
herself
queen
of
the
great
kingdom
of
Micomicon
,
is
no
more
so
than
my
*NL*
mother
;
for
,
if
she
was
what
she
says
,
she
would
not
go
rubbing
noses
*NL*
with
one
that
is
here
every
instant
and
behind
every
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorothea
turned
red
at
Sancho
's
words
,
for
the
truth
was
that
her
husband
*NL*
Don
Fernando
had
now
and
then
,
when
the
others
were
not
looking
,
gathered
*NL*
from
her
lips
some
of
the
reward
his
love
had
earned
,
and
Sancho
seeing
*NL*
this
had
considered
that
such
freedom
was
more
like
a
courtesan
than
a
*NL*
queen
of
a
great
kingdom
;
she
,
however
,
being
unable
or
not
caring
to
*NL*
answer
him
,
allowed
him
to
proceed
,
and
he
continued
,
``
This
I
say
,
senor
,
*NL*
because
,
if
after
we
have
travelled
roads
and
highways
,
and
passed
bad
*NL*
nights
and
worse
days
,
one
who
is
now
enjoying
himself
in
this
inn
is
to
*NL*
reap
the
fruit
of
our
labours
,
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
be
in
a
hurry
*NL*
to
saddle
Rocinante
,
put
the
pad
on
the
ass
,
or
get
ready
the
palfrey
;
*NL*
for
it
will
be
better
for
us
to
stay
quiet
,
and
let
every
jade
mind
her
*NL*
spinning
,
and
let
us
go
to
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Good
God
,
what
was
the
indignation
of
Don
Quixote
when
he
heard
the
*NL*
audacious
words
of
his
squire
!
So
great
was
it
,
that
in
a
voice
*NL*
inarticulate
with
rage
,
with
a
stammering
tongue
,
and
eyes
that
flashed
*NL*
living
fire
,
he
exclaimed
,
``
Rascally
clown
,
boorish
,
insolent
,
and
*NL*
ignorant
,
ill-spoken
,
foul-mouthed
,
impudent
backbiter
and
slanderer
!
*NL*
Hast
thou
dared
to
utter
such
words
in
my
presence
and
in
that
of
these
*NL*
illustrious
ladies
?
Hast
thou
dared
to
harbour
such
gross
and
shameless
*NL*
thoughts
in
thy
muddled
imagination
?
Begone
from
my
presence
,
thou
born
*NL*
monster
,
storehouse
of
lies
,
hoard
of
untruths
,
garner
of
knaveries
,
*NL*
inventor
of
scandals
,
publisher
of
absurdities
,
enemy
of
the
respect
due
*NL*
to
royal
personages
!
Begone
,
show
thyself
no
more
before
me
under
pain
of
*NL*
my
wrath
;
''
and
so
saying
he
knitted
his
brows
,
puffed
out
his
cheeks
,
*NL*
gazed
around
him
,
and
stamped
on
the
ground
violently
with
his
right
*NL*
foot
,
showing
in
every
way
the
rage
that
was
pent
up
in
his
heart
;
and
at
*NL*
his
words
and
furious
gestures
Sancho
was
so
scared
and
terrified
that
he
*NL*
would
have
been
glad
if
the
earth
had
opened
that
instant
and
swallowed
*NL*
him
,
and
his
only
thought
was
to
turn
round
and
make
his
escape
from
the
*NL*
angry
presence
of
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
ready-witted
Dorothea
,
who
by
this
time
so
well
understood
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
humour
,
said
,
to
mollify
his
wrath
,
``
Be
not
irritated
at
the
*NL*
absurdities
your
good
squire
has
uttered
,
Sir
Knight
of
the
Rueful
*NL*
Countenance
,
for
perhaps
he
did
not
utter
them
without
cause
,
and
from
*NL*
his
good
sense
and
Christian
conscience
it
is
not
likely
that
he
would
*NL*
bear
false
witness
against
anyone
.
We
may
therefore
believe
,
without
any
*NL*
hesitation
,
that
since
,
as
you
say
,
sir
knight
,
everything
in
this
castle
*NL*
goes
and
is
brought
about
by
means
of
enchantment
,
Sancho
,
I
say
,
may
*NL*
possibly
have
seen
,
through
this
diabolical
medium
,
what
he
says
he
saw
*NL*
so
much
to
the
detriment
of
my
modesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
by
God
Omnipotent
,
''
exclaimed
Don
Quixote
at
this
,
``
your
*NL*
highness
has
hit
the
point
;
and
that
some
vile
illusion
must
have
come
*NL*
before
this
sinner
of
a
Sancho
,
that
made
him
see
what
it
would
have
been
*NL*
impossible
to
see
by
any
other
means
than
enchantments
;
for
I
know
well
*NL*
enough
,
from
the
poor
fellow
's
goodness
and
harmlessness
,
that
he
is
*NL*
incapable
of
bearing
false
witness
against
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
no
doubt
,
''
said
Don
Fernando
,
``
for
which
reason
,
Senor
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
you
ought
to
forgive
him
and
restore
him
to
the
bosom
of
your
*NL*
favour
,
sicut
erat
in
principio
,
before
illusions
of
this
sort
had
taken
*NL*
away
his
senses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
said
he
was
ready
to
pardon
him
,
and
the
curate
went
for
*NL*
Sancho
,
who
came
in
very
humbly
,
and
falling
on
his
knees
begged
for
the
*NL*
hand
of
his
master
,
who
having
presented
it
to
him
and
allowed
him
to
*NL*
kiss
it
,
gave
him
his
blessing
and
said
,
``
Now
,
Sancho
my
son
,
thou
wilt
*NL*
be
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
I
have
many
a
time
told
thee
,
that
*NL*
everything
in
this
castle
is
done
by
means
of
enchantment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
,
I
believe
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
except
the
affair
of
the
blanket
,
*NL*
which
came
to
pass
in
reality
by
ordinary
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
it
not
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
had
it
been
so
,
I
would
have
*NL*
avenged
thee
that
instant
,
or
even
now
;
but
neither
then
nor
now
could
I
,
*NL*
nor
have
I
seen
anyone
upon
whom
to
avenge
thy
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
eager
to
know
what
the
affair
of
the
blanket
was
,
and
the
*NL*
landlord
gave
them
a
minute
account
of
Sancho
's
flights
,
at
which
they
*NL*
laughed
not
a
little
,
and
at
which
Sancho
would
have
been
no
less
out
of
*NL*
countenance
had
not
his
master
once
more
assured
him
it
was
all
*NL*
enchantment
.
For
all
that
his
simplicity
never
reached
so
high
a
pitch
*NL*
that
he
could
persuade
himself
it
was
not
the
plain
and
simple
truth
,
*NL*
without
any
deception
whatever
about
it
,
that
he
had
been
blanketed
by
*NL*
beings
of
flesh
and
blood
,
and
not
by
visionary
and
imaginary
phantoms
,
*NL*
as
his
master
believed
and
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
illustrious
company
had
now
been
two
days
in
the
inn
;
and
as
it
*NL*
seemed
to
them
time
to
depart
,
they
devised
a
plan
so
that
,
without
*NL*
giving
Dorothea
and
Don
Fernando
the
trouble
of
going
back
with
Don
*NL*
Quixote
to
his
village
under
pretence
of
restoring
Queen
Micomicona
,
the
*NL*
curate
and
the
barber
might
carry
him
away
with
them
as
they
proposed
,
*NL*
and
the
curate
be
able
to
take
his
madness
in
hand
at
home
;
and
in
*NL*
pursuance
of
their
plan
they
arranged
with
the
owner
of
an
oxcart
who
*NL*
happened
to
be
passing
that
way
to
carry
him
after
this
fashion
.
They
*NL*
constructed
a
kind
of
cage
with
wooden
bars
,
large
enough
to
hold
Don
*NL*
Quixote
comfortably
;
and
then
Don
Fernando
and
his
companions
,
the
*NL*
servants
of
Don
Luis
,
and
the
officers
of
the
Brotherhood
,
together
with
*NL*
the
landlord
,
by
the
directions
and
advice
of
the
curate
,
covered
their
*NL*
faces
and
disguised
themselves
,
some
in
one
way
,
some
in
another
,
so
as
*NL*
to
appear
to
Don
Quixote
quite
different
from
the
persons
he
had
seen
in
*NL*
the
castle
.
This
done
,
in
profound
silence
they
entered
the
room
where
he
*NL*
was
asleep
,
taking
his
rest
after
the
past
frays
,
and
advancing
to
*NL*
where
he
was
sleeping
tranquilly
,
not
dreaming
of
anything
of
the
kind
*NL*
happening
,
they
seized
him
firmly
and
bound
him
fast
hand
and
foot
,
so
*NL*
that
,
when
he
awoke
startled
,
he
was
unable
to
move
,
and
could
only
*NL*
marvel
and
wonder
at
the
strange
figures
he
saw
before
him
;
upon
which
he
*NL*
at
once
gave
way
to
the
idea
which
his
crazed
fancy
invariably
conjured
*NL*
up
before
him
,
and
took
it
into
his
head
that
all
these
shapes
were
*NL*
phantoms
of
the
enchanted
castle
,
and
that
he
himself
was
unquestionably
*NL*
enchanted
as
he
could
neither
move
nor
help
himself
;
precisely
what
the
*NL*
curate
,
the
concoctor
of
the
scheme
,
expected
would
happen
.
Of
all
that
*NL*
were
there
Sancho
was
the
only
one
who
was
at
once
in
his
senses
and
in
*NL*
his
own
proper
character
,
and
he
,
though
he
was
within
very
little
of
*NL*
sharing
his
master
's
infirmity
,
did
not
fail
to
perceive
who
all
these
*NL*
disguised
figures
were
;
but
he
did
not
dare
to
open
his
lips
until
he
saw
*NL*
what
came
of
this
assault
and
capture
of
his
master
;
nor
did
the
latter
*NL*
utter
a
word
,
waiting
to
the
upshot
of
his
mishap
;
which
was
that
*NL*
bringing
in
the
cage
,
they
shut
him
up
in
it
and
nailed
the
bars
so
*NL*
firmly
that
they
could
not
be
easily
burst
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
then
took
him
on
their
shoulders
,
and
as
they
passed
out
of
the
room
*NL*
an
awful
voice
--
as
much
so
as
the
barber
,
not
he
of
the
pack-saddle
but
*NL*
the
other
,
was
able
to
make
it
--
was
heard
to
say
,
``
O
Knight
of
the
Rueful
*NL*
Countenance
,
let
not
this
captivity
in
which
thou
art
placed
afflict
*NL*
thee
,
for
this
must
needs
be
,
for
the
more
speedy
accomplishment
of
the
*NL*
adventure
in
which
thy
great
heart
has
engaged
thee
;
the
which
shall
be
*NL*
accomplished
when
the
raging
Manchegan
lion
and
the
white
Tobosan
dove
*NL*
shall
be
linked
together
,
having
first
humbled
their
haughty
necks
to
the
*NL*
gentle
yoke
of
matrimony
.
And
from
this
marvellous
union
shall
come
forth
*NL*
to
the
light
of
the
world
brave
whelps
that
shall
rival
the
ravening
*NL*
claws
of
their
valiant
father
;
and
this
shall
come
to
pass
ere
the
*NL*
pursuer
of
the
flying
nymph
shall
in
his
swift
natural
course
have
twice
*NL*
visited
the
starry
signs
.
And
thou
,
O
most
noble
and
obedient
squire
that
*NL*
ever
bore
sword
at
side
,
beard
on
face
,
or
nose
to
smell
with
,
be
not
*NL*
dismayed
or
grieved
to
see
the
flower
of
knight-errantry
carried
away
*NL*
thus
before
thy
very
eyes
;
for
soon
,
if
it
so
please
the
Framer
of
the
*NL*
universe
,
thou
shalt
see
thyself
exalted
to
such
a
height
that
thou
shalt
*NL*
not
know
thyself
,
and
the
promises
which
thy
good
master
has
made
thee
*NL*
shall
not
prove
false
;
and
I
assure
thee
,
on
the
authority
of
the
sage
*NL*
Mentironiana
,
that
thy
wages
shall
be
paid
thee
,
as
thou
shalt
see
in
due
*NL*
season
.
Follow
then
the
footsteps
of
the
valiant
enchanted
knight
,
for
it
*NL*
is
expedient
that
thou
shouldst
go
to
the
destination
assigned
to
both
of
*NL*
you
;
and
as
it
is
not
permitted
to
me
to
say
more
,
God
be
with
thee
;
for
*NL*
I
return
to
that
place
I
wot
of
;
''
and
as
he
brought
the
prophecy
to
a
*NL*
close
he
raised
his
voice
to
a
high
pitch
,
and
then
lowered
it
to
such
a
*NL*
soft
tone
,
that
even
those
who
knew
it
was
all
a
joke
were
almost
*NL*
inclined
to
take
what
they
heard
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
comforted
by
the
prophecy
he
heard
,
for
he
at
once
*NL*
comprehended
its
meaning
perfectly
,
and
perceived
it
was
promised
to
him
*NL*
that
he
should
see
himself
united
in
holy
and
lawful
matrimony
with
his
*NL*
beloved
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
from
whose
blessed
womb
should
proceed
the
*NL*
whelps
,
his
sons
,
to
the
eternal
glory
of
La
Mancha
;
and
being
thoroughly
*NL*
and
firmly
persuaded
of
this
,
he
lifted
up
his
voice
,
and
with
a
deep
*NL*
sigh
exclaimed
,
``
Oh
thou
,
whoever
thou
art
,
who
hast
foretold
me
so
much
*NL*
good
,
I
implore
of
thee
that
on
my
part
thou
entreat
that
sage
enchanter
*NL*
who
takes
charge
of
my
interests
,
that
he
leave
me
not
to
perish
in
this
*NL*
captivity
in
which
they
are
now
carrying
me
away
,
ere
I
see
fulfilled
*NL*
promises
so
joyful
and
incomparable
as
those
which
have
been
now
made
me
;
*NL*
for
,
let
this
but
come
to
pass
,
and
I
shall
glory
in
the
pains
of
my
*NL*
prison
,
find
comfort
in
these
chains
wherewith
they
bind
me
,
and
regard
*NL*
this
bed
whereon
they
stretch
me
,
not
as
a
hard
battle-field
,
but
as
a
*NL*
soft
and
happy
nuptial
couch
;
and
touching
the
consolation
of
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
,
my
squire
,
I
rely
upon
his
goodness
and
rectitude
that
he
will
not
*NL*
desert
me
in
good
or
evil
fortune
;
for
if
,
by
his
ill
luck
or
mine
,
it
*NL*
may
not
happen
to
be
in
my
power
to
give
him
the
island
I
have
promised
,
*NL*
or
any
equivalent
for
it
,
at
least
his
wages
shall
not
be
lost
;
for
in
my
*NL*
will
,
which
is
already
made
,
I
have
declared
the
sum
that
shall
be
paid
*NL*
to
him
,
measured
,
not
by
his
many
faithful
services
,
but
by
the
means
at
*NL*
my
disposal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
bowed
his
head
very
respectfully
and
kissed
both
his
hands
,
for
,
*NL*
being
tied
together
,
he
could
not
kiss
one
;
and
then
the
apparitions
*NL*
lifted
the
cage
upon
their
shoulders
and
fixed
it
upon
the
ox-cart

CHAPTER
XLVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
STRANGE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
DON
QUIXOTE
OF
LA
MANCHA
WAS
CARRIED
AWAY
*NL*
ENCHANTED
,
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
REMARKABLE
INCIDENTS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Don
Quixote
saw
himself
caged
and
hoisted
on
the
cart
in
this
way
,
*NL*
he
said
,
``
Many
grave
histories
of
knights-errant
have
I
read
;
but
never
*NL*
yet
have
I
read
,
seen
,
or
heard
of
their
carrying
off
enchanted
*NL*
knights-errant
in
this
fashion
,
or
at
the
slow
pace
that
these
lazy
,
*NL*
sluggish
animals
promise
;
for
they
always
take
them
away
through
the
air
*NL*
with
marvellous
swiftness
,
enveloped
in
a
dark
thick
cloud
,
or
on
a
*NL*
chariot
of
fire
,
or
it
may
be
on
some
hippogriff
or
other
beast
of
the
*NL*
kind
;
but
to
carry
me
off
like
this
on
an
ox-cart
!
By
God
,
it
puzzles
me
!
*NL*
But
perhaps
the
chivalry
and
enchantments
of
our
day
take
a
different
*NL*
course
from
that
of
those
in
days
gone
by
;
and
it
may
be
,
too
,
that
as
I
*NL*
am
a
new
knight
in
the
world
,
and
the
first
to
revive
the
already
*NL*
forgotten
calling
of
knight-adventurers
,
they
may
have
newly
invented
*NL*
other
kinds
of
enchantments
and
other
modes
of
carrying
off
the
*NL*
enchanted
.
What
thinkest
thou
of
the
matter
,
Sancho
my
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
,
''
answered
Sancho
,
``
not
being
as
well
read
as
*NL*
your
worship
in
errant
writings
;
but
for
all
that
I
venture
to
say
and
*NL*
swear
that
these
apparitions
that
are
about
us
are
not
quite
catholic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catholic
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
``
Father
of
me
!
how
can
they
be
Catholic
*NL*
when
they
are
all
devils
that
have
taken
fantastic
shapes
to
come
and
do
*NL*
this
,
and
bring
me
to
this
condition
?
And
if
thou
wouldst
prove
it
,
touch
*NL*
them
,
and
feel
them
,
and
thou
wilt
find
they
have
only
bodies
of
air
,
and
*NL*
no
consistency
except
in
appearance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
,
master
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
I
have
touched
them
already
;
and
that
*NL*
devil
,
that
goes
about
there
so
busily
,
has
firm
flesh
,
and
another
*NL*
property
very
different
from
what
I
have
heard
say
devils
have
,
for
by
*NL*
all
accounts
they
all
smell
of
brimstone
and
other
bad
smells
;
but
this
*NL*
one
smells
of
amber
half
a
league
off
.
''
Sancho
was
here
speaking
of
Don
*NL*
Fernando
,
who
,
like
a
gentleman
of
his
rank
,
was
very
likely
perfumed
as
*NL*
Sancho
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marvel
not
at
that
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
let
me
*NL*
tell
thee
devils
are
crafty
;
and
even
if
they
do
carry
odours
about
with
*NL*
them
,
they
themselves
have
no
smell
,
because
they
are
spirits
;
or
,
if
*NL*
they
have
any
smell
,
they
can
not
smell
of
anything
sweet
,
but
of
*NL*
something
foul
and
fetid
;
and
the
reason
is
that
as
they
carry
hell
with
*NL*
them
wherever
they
go
,
and
can
get
no
ease
whatever
from
their
torments
,
*NL*
and
as
a
sweet
smell
is
a
thing
that
gives
pleasure
and
enjoyment
,
it
is
*NL*
impossible
that
they
can
smell
sweet
;
if
,
then
,
this
devil
thou
speakest
*NL*
of
seems
to
thee
to
smell
of
amber
,
either
thou
art
deceiving
thyself
,
or
*NL*
he
wants
to
deceive
thee
by
making
thee
fancy
he
is
not
a
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
conversation
that
passed
between
master
and
man
;
and
Don
*NL*
Fernando
and
Cardenio
,
apprehensive
of
Sancho
's
making
a
complete
*NL*
discovery
of
their
scheme
,
towards
which
he
had
already
gone
some
way
,
*NL*
resolved
to
hasten
their
departure
,
and
calling
the
landlord
aside
,
they
*NL*
directed
him
to
saddle
Rocinante
and
put
the
pack-saddle
on
Sancho
's
ass
,
*NL*
which
he
did
with
great
alacrity
.
In
the
meantime
the
curate
had
made
an
*NL*
arrangement
with
the
officers
that
they
should
bear
them
company
as
far
*NL*
as
his
village
,
he
paying
them
so
much
a
day
.
Cardenio
hung
the
buckler
*NL*
on
one
side
of
the
bow
of
Rocinante
's
saddle
and
the
basin
on
the
other
,
*NL*
and
by
signs
commanded
Sancho
to
mount
his
ass
and
take
Rocinante
's
*NL*
bridle
,
and
at
each
side
of
the
cart
he
placed
two
officers
with
their
*NL*
muskets
;
but
before
the
cart
was
put
in
motion
,
out
came
the
landlady
and
*NL*
her
daughter
and
Maritornes
to
bid
Don
Quixote
farewell
,
pretending
to
*NL*
weep
with
grief
at
his
misfortune
;
and
to
them
Don
Quixote
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weep
not
,
good
ladies
,
for
all
these
mishaps
are
the
lot
of
those
who
*NL*
follow
the
profession
I
profess
;
and
if
these
reverses
did
not
befall
me
*NL*
I
should
not
esteem
myself
a
famous
knight-errant
;
for
such
things
never
*NL*
happen
to
knights
of
little
renown
and
fame
,
because
nobody
in
the
world
*NL*
thinks
about
them
;
to
valiant
knights
they
do
,
for
these
are
envied
for
*NL*
their
virtue
and
valour
by
many
princes
and
other
knights
who
compass
the
*NL*
destruction
of
the
worthy
by
base
means
.
Nevertheless
,
virtue
is
of
*NL*
herself
so
mighty
,
that
,
in
spite
of
all
the
magic
that
Zoroaster
its
*NL*
first
inventor
knew
,
she
will
come
victorious
out
of
every
trial
,
and
*NL*
shed
her
light
upon
the
earth
as
the
sun
does
upon
the
heavens
.
Forgive
*NL*
me
,
fair
ladies
,
if
,
through
inadvertence
,
I
have
in
aught
offended
you
;
*NL*
for
intentionally
and
wittingly
I
have
never
done
so
to
any
;
and
pray
to
*NL*
God
that
he
deliver
me
from
this
captivity
to
which
some
malevolent
*NL*
enchanter
has
consigned
me
;
and
should
I
find
myself
released
therefrom
,
*NL*
the
favours
that
ye
have
bestowed
upon
me
in
this
castle
shall
be
held
in
*NL*
memory
by
me
,
that
I
may
acknowledge
,
recognise
,
and
requite
them
as
they
*NL*
deserve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
passing
between
the
ladies
of
the
castle
and
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
the
curate
and
the
barber
bade
farewell
to
Don
Fernando
and
his
*NL*
companions
,
to
the
captain
,
his
brother
,
and
the
ladies
,
now
all
made
*NL*
happy
,
and
in
particular
to
Dorothea
and
Luscinda
.
They
all
embraced
one
*NL*
another
,
and
promised
to
let
each
other
know
how
things
went
with
them
,
*NL*
and
Don
Fernando
directed
the
curate
where
to
write
to
him
,
to
tell
him
*NL*
what
became
of
Don
Quixote
,
assuring
him
that
there
was
nothing
that
*NL*
could
give
him
more
pleasure
than
to
hear
of
it
,
and
that
he
too
,
on
his
*NL*
part
,
would
send
him
word
of
everything
he
thought
he
would
like
to
know
,
*NL*
about
his
marriage
,
Zoraida
's
baptism
,
Don
Luis
's
affair
,
and
Luscinda
's
*NL*
return
to
her
home
.
The
curate
promised
to
comply
with
his
request
*NL*
carefully
,
and
they
embraced
once
more
,
and
renewed
their
promises
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
approached
the
curate
and
handed
him
some
papers
,
saying
he
*NL*
had
discovered
them
in
the
lining
of
the
valise
in
which
the
novel
of
*NL*
``
The
Ill-advised
Curiosity
''
had
been
found
,
and
that
he
might
take
them
*NL*
all
away
with
him
as
their
owner
had
not
since
returned
;
for
,
as
he
could
*NL*
not
read
,
he
did
not
want
them
himself
.
The
curate
thanked
him
,
and
*NL*
opening
them
he
saw
at
the
beginning
of
the
manuscript
the
words
,
``
Novel
*NL*
of
Rinconete
and
Cortadillo
,
''
by
which
he
perceived
that
it
was
a
novel
,
*NL*
and
as
that
of
``
The
Ill-advised
Curiosity
''
had
been
good
he
concluded
*NL*
this
would
be
so
too
,
as
they
were
both
probably
by
the
same
author
;
so
*NL*
he
kept
it
,
intending
to
read
it
when
he
had
an
opportunity
.
He
then
*NL*
mounted
and
his
friend
the
barber
did
the
same
,
both
masked
,
so
as
not
to
*NL*
be
recognised
by
Don
Quixote
,
and
set
out
following
in
the
rear
of
the
*NL*
cart
.
The
order
of
march
was
this
:
first
went
the
cart
with
the
owner
*NL*
leading
it
;
at
each
side
of
it
marched
the
officers
of
the
Brotherhood
,
*NL*
as
has
been
said
,
with
their
muskets
;
then
followed
Sancho
Panza
on
his
*NL*
ass
,
leading
Rocinante
by
the
bridle
;
and
behind
all
came
the
curate
and
*NL*
the
barber
on
their
mighty
mules
,
with
faces
covered
,
as
aforesaid
,
and
a
*NL*
grave
and
serious
air
,
measuring
their
pace
to
suit
the
slow
steps
of
the
*NL*
oxen
.
Don
Quixote
was
seated
in
the
cage
,
with
his
hands
tied
and
his
*NL*
feet
stretched
out
,
leaning
against
the
bars
as
silent
and
as
patient
as
*NL*
if
he
were
a
stone
statue
and
not
a
man
of
flesh
.
Thus
slowly
and
*NL*
silently
they
made
,
it
might
be
,
two
leagues
,
until
they
reached
a
valley
*NL*
which
the
carter
thought
a
convenient
place
for
resting
and
feeding
his
*NL*
oxen
,
and
he
said
so
to
the
curate
,
but
the
barber
was
of
opinion
that
*NL*
they
ought
to
push
on
a
little
farther
,
as
at
the
other
side
of
a
hill
*NL*
which
appeared
close
by
he
knew
there
was
a
valley
that
had
more
grass
*NL*
and
much
better
than
the
one
where
they
proposed
to
halt
;
and
his
advice
*NL*
was
taken
and
they
continued
their
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
that
moment
the
curate
,
looking
back
,
saw
coming
on
behind
them
*NL*
six
or
seven
mounted
men
,
well
found
and
equipped
,
who
soon
overtook
*NL*
them
,
for
they
were
travelling
,
not
at
the
sluggish
,
deliberate
pace
of
*NL*
oxen
,
but
like
men
who
rode
canons
'
mules
,
and
in
haste
to
take
their
*NL*
noontide
rest
as
soon
as
possible
at
the
inn
which
was
in
sight
not
a
*NL*
league
off
.
The
quick
travellers
came
up
with
the
slow
,
and
courteous
*NL*
salutations
were
exchanged
;
and
one
of
the
new
comers
,
who
was
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
a
canon
of
Toledo
and
master
of
the
others
who
accompanied
him
,
observing
*NL*
the
regular
order
of
the
procession
,
the
cart
,
the
officers
,
Sancho
,
*NL*
Rocinante
,
the
curate
and
the
barber
,
and
above
all
Don
Quixote
caged
and
*NL*
confined
,
could
not
help
asking
what
was
the
meaning
of
carrying
the
man
*NL*
in
that
fashion
;
though
,
from
the
badges
of
the
officers
,
he
already
*NL*
concluded
that
he
must
be
some
desperate
highwayman
or
other
malefactor
*NL*
whose
punishment
fell
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Holy
Brotherhood
.
*NL*
One
of
the
officers
to
whom
he
had
put
the
question
,
replied
,
``
Let
the
*NL*
gentleman
himself
tell
you
the
meaning
of
his
going
this
way
,
senor
,
for
*NL*
we
do
not
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
overheard
the
conversation
and
said
,
``
Haply
,
gentlemen
,
you
*NL*
are
versed
and
learned
in
matters
of
errant
chivalry
?
Because
if
you
are
*NL*
I
will
tell
you
my
misfortunes
;
if
not
,
there
is
no
good
in
my
giving
*NL*
myself
the
trouble
of
relating
them
;
''
but
here
the
curate
and
the
barber
,
*NL*
seeing
that
the
travellers
were
engaged
in
conversation
with
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
came
forward
,
in
order
to
answer
in
such
a
way
as
to
save
their
stratagem
*NL*
from
being
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
canon
,
replying
to
Don
Quixote
,
said
,
``
In
truth
,
brother
,
I
know
more
*NL*
about
books
of
chivalry
than
I
do
about
Villalpando
's
elements
of
logic
;
*NL*
so
if
that
be
all
,
you
may
safely
tell
me
what
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
God
's
name
,
then
,
senor
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
if
that
be
so
,
I
*NL*
would
have
you
know
that
I
am
held
enchanted
in
this
cage
by
the
envy
and
*NL*
fraud
of
wicked
enchanters
;
for
virtue
is
more
persecuted
by
the
wicked
*NL*
than
loved
by
the
good
.
I
am
a
knight-errant
,
and
not
one
of
those
whose
*NL*
names
Fame
has
never
thought
of
immortalising
in
her
record
,
but
of
those
*NL*
who
,
in
defiance
and
in
spite
of
envy
itself
,
and
all
the
magicians
that
*NL*
Persia
,
or
Brahmans
that
India
,
or
Gymnosophists
that
Ethiopia
ever
*NL*
produced
,
will
place
their
names
in
the
temple
of
immortality
,
to
serve
*NL*
as
examples
and
patterns
for
ages
to
come
,
whereby
knights-errant
may
see
*NL*
the
footsteps
in
which
they
must
tread
if
they
would
attain
the
summit
*NL*
and
crowning
point
of
honour
in
arms

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Senor
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
says
,
''
observed
the
curate
,
``
is
the
*NL*
truth
;
for
he
goes
enchanted
in
this
cart
,
not
from
any
fault
or
sins
of
*NL*
his
,
but
because
of
the
malevolence
of
those
to
whom
virtue
is
odious
and
*NL*
valour
hateful
.
This
,
senor
,
is
the
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
if
*NL*
you
have
ever
heard
him
named
,
whose
valiant
achievements
and
mighty
*NL*
deeds
shall
be
written
on
lasting
brass
and
imperishable
marble
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
of
envy
to
obscure
them
and
malice
to
*NL*
hide
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
canon
heard
both
the
prisoner
and
the
man
who
was
at
liberty
*NL*
talk
in
such
a
strain
he
was
ready
to
cross
himself
in
his
astonishment
,
*NL*
and
could
not
make
out
what
had
befallen
him
;
and
all
his
attendants
were
*NL*
in
the
same
state
of
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
Sancho
Panza
,
who
had
drawn
near
to
hear
the
conversation
,
*NL*
said
,
in
order
to
make
everything
plain
,
``
Well
,
sirs
,
you
may
like
or
*NL*
dislike
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
,
my
master
,
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
is
just
as
much
enchanted
as
my
mother
.
He
is
in
his
full
*NL*
senses
,
he
eats
and
he
drinks
,
and
he
has
his
calls
like
other
men
and
as
*NL*
he
had
yesterday
,
before
they
caged
him
.
And
if
that
's
the
case
,
what
do
*NL*
they
mean
by
wanting
me
to
believe
that
he
is
enchanted
?
For
I
have
heard
*NL*
many
a
one
say
that
enchanted
people
neither
eat
,
nor
sleep
,
nor
talk
;
*NL*
and
my
master
,
if
you
do
n't
stop
him
,
will
talk
more
than
thirty
*NL*
lawyers
.
''
Then
turning
to
the
curate
he
exclaimed
,
``
Ah
,
senor
curate
,
*NL*
senor
curate
!
do
you
think
I
do
n't
know
you
?
Do
you
think
I
do
n't
guess
*NL*
and
see
the
drift
of
these
new
enchantments
?
Well
then
,
I
can
tell
you
I
*NL*
know
you
,
for
all
your
face
is
covered
,
and
I
can
tell
you
I
am
up
to
*NL*
you
,
however
you
may
hide
your
tricks
.
After
all
,
where
envy
reigns
*NL*
virtue
can
not
live
,
and
where
there
is
niggardliness
there
can
be
no
*NL*
liberality
.
Ill
betide
the
devil
!
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
worship
my
*NL*
master
would
be
married
to
the
Princess
Micomicona
this
minute
,
and
I
*NL*
should
be
a
count
at
least
;
for
no
less
was
to
be
expected
,
as
well
from
*NL*
the
goodness
of
my
master
,
him
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
as
from
the
*NL*
greatness
of
my
services
.
But
I
see
now
how
true
it
is
what
they
say
in
*NL*
these
parts
,
that
the
wheel
of
fortune
turns
faster
than
a
mill-wheel
,
*NL*
and
that
those
who
were
up
yesterday
are
down
to-day
.
I
am
sorry
for
my
*NL*
wife
and
children
,
for
when
they
might
fairly
and
reasonably
expect
to
*NL*
see
their
father
return
to
them
a
governor
or
viceroy
of
some
island
or
*NL*
kingdom
,
they
will
see
him
come
back
a
horse-boy
.
I
have
said
all
this
,
*NL*
senor
curate
,
only
to
urge
your
paternity
to
lay
to
your
conscience
your
*NL*
ill-treatment
of
my
master
;
and
have
a
care
that
God
does
not
call
you
to
*NL*
account
in
another
life
for
making
a
prisoner
of
him
in
this
way
,
and
*NL*
charge
against
you
all
the
succours
and
good
deeds
that
my
lord
Don
*NL*
Quixote
leaves
undone
while
he
is
shut
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trim
those
lamps
there
!
''
exclaimed
the
barber
at
this
;
``
so
you
are
of
*NL*
the
same
fraternity
as
your
master
,
too
,
Sancho
?
By
God
,
I
begin
to
see
*NL*
that
you
will
have
to
keep
him
company
in
the
cage
,
and
be
enchanted
like
*NL*
him
for
having
caught
some
of
his
humour
and
chivalry
.
It
was
an
evil
*NL*
hour
when
you
let
yourself
be
got
with
child
by
his
promises
,
and
that
*NL*
island
you
long
so
much
for
found
its
way
into
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
with
child
by
anyone
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
nor
am
I
a
man
to
let
*NL*
myself
be
got
with
child
,
if
it
was
by
the
King
himself
.
Though
I
am
poor
*NL*
I
am
an
old
Christian
,
and
I
owe
nothing
to
nobody
,
and
if
I
long
for
an
*NL*
island
,
other
people
long
for
worse
.
Each
of
us
is
the
son
of
his
own
*NL*
works
;
and
being
a
man
I
may
come
to
be
pope
,
not
to
say
governor
of
an
*NL*
island
,
especially
as
my
master
may
win
so
many
that
he
will
not
know
*NL*
whom
to
give
them
to
.
Mind
how
you
talk
,
master
barber
;
for
shaving
is
*NL*
not
everything
,
and
there
is
some
difference
between
Peter
and
Peter
.
I
*NL*
say
this
because
we
all
know
one
another
,
and
it
will
not
do
to
throw
*NL*
false
dice
with
me
;
and
as
to
the
enchantment
of
my
master
,
God
knows
the
*NL*
truth
;
leave
it
as
it
is
;
it
only
makes
it
worse
to
stir
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
barber
did
not
care
to
answer
Sancho
lest
by
his
plain
speaking
he
*NL*
should
disclose
what
the
curate
and
he
himself
were
trying
so
hard
to
*NL*
conceal
;
and
under
the
same
apprehension
the
curate
had
asked
the
canon
*NL*
to
ride
on
a
little
in
advance
,
so
that
he
might
tell
him
the
mystery
of
*NL*
this
man
in
the
cage
,
and
other
things
that
would
amuse
him
.
The
canon
*NL*
agreed
,
and
going
on
ahead
with
his
servants
,
listened
with
attention
to
*NL*
the
account
of
the
character
,
life
,
madness
,
and
ways
of
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
given
him
by
the
curate
,
who
described
to
him
briefly
the
beginning
and
*NL*
origin
of
his
craze
,
and
told
him
the
whole
story
of
his
adventures
up
to
*NL*
his
being
confined
in
the
cage
,
together
with
the
plan
they
had
of
taking
*NL*
him
home
to
try
if
by
any
means
they
could
discover
a
cure
for
his
*NL*
madness
.
The
canon
and
his
servants
were
surprised
anew
when
they
heard
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
strange
story
,
and
when
it
was
finished
he
said
,
``
To
tell
*NL*
the
truth
,
senor
curate
,
I
for
my
part
consider
what
they
call
books
of
*NL*
chivalry
to
be
mischievous
to
the
State
;
and
though
,
led
by
idle
and
*NL*
false
taste
,
I
have
read
the
beginnings
of
almost
all
that
have
been
*NL*
printed
,
I
never
could
manage
to
read
any
one
of
them
from
beginning
to
*NL*
end
;
for
it
seems
to
me
they
are
all
more
or
less
the
same
thing
;
and
one
*NL*
has
nothing
more
in
it
than
another
;
this
no
more
than
that
.
And
in
my
*NL*
opinion
this
sort
of
writing
and
composition
is
of
the
same
species
as
*NL*
the
fables
they
call
the
Milesian
,
nonsensical
tales
that
aim
solely
at
*NL*
giving
amusement
and
not
instruction
,
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
*NL*
apologue
fables
which
amuse
and
instruct
at
the
same
time
.
And
though
it
*NL*
may
be
the
chief
object
of
such
books
to
amuse
,
I
do
not
know
how
they
*NL*
can
succeed
,
when
they
are
so
full
of
such
monstrous
nonsense
.
For
the
*NL*
enjoyment
the
mind
feels
must
come
from
the
beauty
and
harmony
which
it
*NL*
perceives
or
contemplates
in
the
things
that
the
eye
or
the
imagination
*NL*
brings
before
it
;
and
nothing
that
has
any
ugliness
or
disproportion
*NL*
about
it
can
give
any
pleasure
.
What
beauty
,
then
,
or
what
proportion
of
*NL*
the
parts
to
the
whole
,
or
of
the
whole
to
the
parts
,
can
there
be
in
a
*NL*
book
or
fable
where
a
lad
of
sixteen
cuts
down
a
giant
as
tall
as
a
tower
*NL*
and
makes
two
halves
of
him
as
if
he
was
an
almond
cake
?
And
when
they
*NL*
want
to
give
us
a
picture
of
a
battle
,
after
having
told
us
that
there
*NL*
are
a
million
of
combatants
on
the
side
of
the
enemy
,
let
the
hero
of
the
*NL*
book
be
opposed
to
them
,
and
we
have
perforce
to
believe
,
whether
we
like
*NL*
it
or
not
,
that
the
said
knight
wins
the
victory
by
the
single
might
of
*NL*
his
strong
arm
.
And
then
,
what
shall
we
say
of
the
facility
with
which
a
*NL*
born
queen
or
empress
will
give
herself
over
into
the
arms
of
some
*NL*
unknown
wandering
knight
?
What
mind
,
that
is
not
wholly
barbarous
and
*NL*
uncultured
,
can
find
pleasure
in
reading
of
how
a
great
tower
full
of
*NL*
knights
sails
away
across
the
sea
like
a
ship
with
a
fair
wind
,
and
will
*NL*
be
to-night
in
Lombardy
and
to-morrow
morning
in
the
land
of
Prester
John
*NL*
of
the
Indies
,
or
some
other
that
Ptolemy
never
described
nor
Marco
Polo
*NL*
saw
?
And
if
,
in
answer
to
this
,
I
am
told
that
the
authors
of
books
of
*NL*
the
kind
write
them
as
fiction
,
and
therefore
are
not
bound
to
regard
*NL*
niceties
of
truth
,
I
would
reply
that
fiction
is
all
the
better
the
more
*NL*
it
looks
like
truth
,
and
gives
the
more
pleasure
the
more
probability
and
*NL*
possibility
there
is
about
it
.
Plots
in
fiction
should
be
wedded
to
the
*NL*
understanding
of
the
reader
,
and
be
constructed
in
such
a
way
that
,
*NL*
reconciling
impossibilities
,
smoothing
over
difficulties
,
keeping
the
*NL*
mind
on
the
alert
,
they
may
surprise
,
interest
,
divert
,
and
entertain
,
so
*NL*
that
wonder
and
delight
joined
may
keep
pace
one
with
the
other
;
all
*NL*
which
he
will
fail
to
effect
who
shuns
verisimilitude
and
truth
to
*NL*
nature
,
wherein
lies
the
perfection
of
writing
.
I
have
never
yet
seen
any
*NL*
book
of
chivalry
that
puts
together
a
connected
plot
complete
in
all
its
*NL*
numbers
,
so
that
the
middle
agrees
with
the
beginning
,
and
the
end
with
*NL*
the
beginning
and
middle
;
on
the
contrary
,
they
construct
them
with
such
*NL*
a
multitude
of
members
that
it
seems
as
though
they
meant
to
produce
a
*NL*
chimera
or
monster
rather
than
a
well-proportioned
figure
.
And
besides
*NL*
all
this
they
are
harsh
in
their
style
,
incredible
in
their
achievements
,
*NL*
licentious
in
their
amours
,
uncouth
in
their
courtly
speeches
,
prolix
in
*NL*
their
battles
,
silly
in
their
arguments
,
absurd
in
their
travels
,
and
,
in
*NL*
short
,
wanting
in
everything
like
intelligent
art
;
for
which
reason
they
*NL*
deserve
to
be
banished
from
the
Christian
commonwealth
as
a
worthless
*NL*
breed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
listened
to
him
attentively
and
felt
that
he
was
a
man
of
*NL*
sound
understanding
,
and
that
there
was
good
reason
in
what
he
said
;
so
*NL*
he
told
him
that
,
being
of
the
same
opinion
himself
,
and
bearing
a
grudge
*NL*
to
books
of
chivalry
,
he
had
burned
all
Don
Quixote
's
,
which
were
many
;
*NL*
and
gave
him
an
account
of
the
scrutiny
he
had
made
of
them
,
and
of
those
*NL*
he
had
condemned
to
the
flames
and
those
he
had
spared
,
with
which
the
*NL*
canon
was
not
a
little
amused
,
adding
that
though
he
had
said
so
much
in
*NL*
condemnation
of
these
books
,
still
he
found
one
good
thing
in
them
,
and
*NL*
that
was
the
opportunity
they
afforded
to
a
gifted
intellect
for
*NL*
displaying
itself
;
for
they
presented
a
wide
and
spacious
field
over
*NL*
which
the
pen
might
range
freely
,
describing
shipwrecks
,
tempests
,
*NL*
combats
,
battles
,
portraying
a
valiant
captain
with
all
the
*NL*
qualifications
requisite
to
make
one
,
showing
him
sagacious
in
foreseeing
*NL*
the
wiles
of
the
enemy
,
eloquent
in
speech
to
encourage
or
restrain
his
*NL*
soldiers
,
ripe
in
counsel
,
rapid
in
resolve
,
as
bold
in
biding
his
time
*NL*
as
in
pressing
the
attack
;
now
picturing
some
sad
tragic
incident
,
now
*NL*
some
joyful
and
unexpected
event
;
here
a
beauteous
lady
,
virtuous
,
wise
,
*NL*
and
modest
;
there
a
Christian
knight
,
brave
and
gentle
;
here
a
lawless
,
*NL*
barbarous
braggart
;
there
a
courteous
prince
,
gallant
and
gracious
;
*NL*
setting
forth
the
devotion
and
loyalty
of
vassals
,
the
greatness

*NL*
generosity
of
nobles

*NL*
IN
WHICH
THE
CANON
PURSUES
THE

THE
BOOKS
OF
CHIVALRY

WITH
*NL*
OTHER
MATTERS
WORTHY
OF
HIS
WIT

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
you
say
,
senor
canon
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
and
for
that
reason
*NL*
those
who
have
hitherto
written
books
of
the
sort
deserve
all
the
more
*NL*
censure
for
writing
without
paying
any
attention
to
good
taste
or
the
*NL*
rules
of
art
,
by
which
they
might
guide
themselves
and
become
as
famous
*NL*
in
prose
as
the
two
princes
of
Greek
and
Latin
poetry
are
in
verse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
myself
,
at
any
rate
,
''
said
the
canon
,
``
was
once
tempted
to
write
a
*NL*
book
of
chivalry
in
which
all
the
points
I
have
mentioned
were
to
be
*NL*
observed
;
and
if
I
must
own
the
truth
I
have
more
than
a
hundred
sheets
*NL*
written
;
and
to
try
if
it
came
up
to
my
own
opinion
of
it
,
I
showed
them
*NL*
to
persons
who
were
fond
of
this
kind
of
reading
,
to
learned
and
*NL*
intelligent
men
as
well
as
to
ignorant
people
who
cared
for
nothing
but
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
nonsense
,
and
from
all
I
obtained
flattering
*NL*
approval
;
nevertheless
I
proceeded
no
farther
with
it
,
as
well
because
it
*NL*
seemed
to
me
an
occupation
inconsistent
with
my
profession
,
as
because
I
*NL*
perceived
that
the
fools
are
more
numerous
than
the
wise
;
and
,
though
it
*NL*
is
better
to
be
praised
by
the
wise
few
than
applauded
by
the
foolish
*NL*
many
,
I
have
no
mind
to
submit
myself
to
the
stupid
judgment
of
the
silly
*NL*
public
,
to
whom
the
reading
of
such
books
falls
for
the
most
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
most
of
all
made
me
hold
my
hand
and
even
abandon
all
idea
of
*NL*
finishing
it
was
an
argument
I
put
to
myself
taken
from
the
plays
that
*NL*
are
acted
now-a-days
,
which
was
in
this
wise
:
if
those
that
are
now
in
*NL*
vogue
,
as
well
those
that
are
pure
invention
as
those
founded
on
history
,
*NL*
are
,
all
or
most
of
them
,
downright
nonsense
and
things
that
have
neither
*NL*
head
nor
tail
,
and
yet
the
public
listens
to
them
with
delight
,
and
*NL*
regards
and
cries
them
up
as
perfection
when
they
are
so
far
from
it
;
and
*NL*
if
the
authors
who
write
them
,
and
the
players
who
act
them
,
say
that
*NL*
this
is
what
they
must
be
,
for
the
public
wants
this
and
will
have
*NL*
nothing
else
;
and
that
those
that
go
by
rule
and
work
out
a
plot
*NL*
according
to
the
laws
of
art
will
only
find
some
half-dozen
intelligent
*NL*
people
to
understand
them
,
while
all
the
rest
remain
blind
to
the
merit
*NL*
of
their
composition
;
and
that
for
themselves
it
is
better
to
get
bread
*NL*
from
the
many
than
praise
from
the
few
;
then
my
book
will
fare
the
same
*NL*
way
,
after
I
have
burnt
off
my
eyebrows
in
trying
to
observe
the
*NL*
principles
I
have
spoken
of
,
and
I
shall
be
`
the
tailor
of
the
corner
.
'
*NL*
And
though
I
have
sometimes
endeavoured
to
convince
actors
that
they
are
*NL*
mistaken
in
this
notion
they
have
adopted
,
and
that
they
would
attract
*NL*
more
people
,
and
get
more
credit
,
by
producing
plays
in
accordance
with
*NL*
the
rules
of
art
,
than
by
absurd
ones
,
they
are
so
thoroughly
wedded
to
*NL*
their
own
opinion
that
no
argument
or
evidence
can
wean
them
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
saying
one
day
to
one
of
these
obstinate
fellows
,
`
Tell
me
,
*NL*
do
you
not
recollect
that
a
few
years
ago
,
there
were
three
tragedies
*NL*
acted
in
Spain
,
written
by
a
famous
poet
of
these
kingdoms
,
which
were
*NL*
such
that
they
filled
all
who
heard
them
with
admiration
,
delight
,
and
*NL*
interest
,
the
ignorant
as
well
as
the
wise
,
the
masses
as
well
as
the
*NL*
higher
orders
,
and
brought
in
more
money
to
the
performers
,
these
three
*NL*
alone
,
than
thirty
of
the
best
that
have
been
since
produced
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
No
doubt
,
'
replied
the
actor
in
question
,
`
you
mean
the
``
Isabella
,
''
the
*NL*
``
Phyllis
,
''
and
the
``
Alexandra
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Those
are
the
ones
I
mean
,
'
said
I
;
`
and
see
if
they
did
not
observe
*NL*
the
principles
of
art
,
and
if
,
by
observing
them
,
they
failed
to
show
*NL*
their
superiority
and
please
all
the
world
;
so
that
the
fault
does
not
*NL*
lie
with
the
public
that
insists
upon
nonsense
,
but
with
those
who
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
produce
something
else
.
``
The
Ingratitude
Revenged
''
was
not
*NL*
nonsense
,
nor
was
there
any
in
``
The
Numantia
,
''
nor
any
to
be
found
in
*NL*
``
The
Merchant
Lover
,
''
nor
yet
in
``
The
Friendly
Fair
Foe
,
''
nor
in
some
*NL*
others
that
have
been
written
by
certain
gifted
poets
,
to
their
own
fame
*NL*
and
renown
,
and
to
the
profit
of
those
that
brought
them
out
;
'
some
*NL*
further
remarks
I
added
to
these
,
with
which
,
I
think
,
I
left
him
rather
*NL*
dumbfoundered
,
but
not
so
satisfied
or
convinced
that
I
could
disabuse
*NL*
him
of
his
error
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
touched
upon
a
subject
,
senor
canon
,
''
observed
the
curate
here
,
*NL*
``
that
has
awakened
an
old
enmity
I
have
against
the
plays
in
vogue
at
the
*NL*
present
day
,
quite
as
strong
as
that
which
I
bear
to
the
books
of
*NL*
chivalry
;
for
while
the
drama
,
according
to
Tully
,
should
be
the
mirror
*NL*
of
human
life
,
the
model
of
manners
,
and
the
image
of
the
truth
,
those
*NL*
which
are
presented
now-a-days
are
mirrors
of
nonsense
,
models
of
folly
,
*NL*
and
images
of
lewdness
.
For
what
greater
nonsense
can
there
be
in
*NL*
connection
with
what
we
are
now
discussing
than
for
an
infant
to
appear
*NL*
in
swaddling
clothes
in
the
first
scene
of
the
first
act
,
and
in
the
*NL*
second
a
grown-up
bearded
man
?
Or
what
greater
absurdity
can
there
be
*NL*
than
putting
before
us
an
old
man
as
a
swashbuckler
,
a
young
man
as
a
*NL*
poltroon
,
a
lackey
using
fine
language
,
a
page
giving
sage
advice
,
a
king
*NL*
plying
as
a
porter
,
a
princess
who
is
a
kitchen-maid
?
And
then
what
shall
*NL*
I
say
of
their
attention
to
the
time
in
which
the
action
they
represent
*NL*
may
or
can
take
place
,
save
that
I
have
seen
a
play
where
the
first
act
*NL*
began
in
Europe
,
the
second
in
Asia
,
the
third
finished
in
Africa
,
and
no
*NL*
doubt
,
had
it
been
in
four
acts
,
the
fourth
would
have
ended
in
America
,
*NL*
and
so
it
would
have
been
laid
in
all
four
quarters
of
the
globe
?
And
if
*NL*
truth
to
life
is
the
main
thing
the
drama
should
keep
in
view
,
how
is
it
*NL*
possible
for
any
average
understanding
to
be
satisfied
when
the
action
is
*NL*
supposed
to
pass
in
the
time
of
King
Pepin
or
Charlemagne
,
and
the
*NL*
principal
personage
in
it
they
represent
to
be
the
Emperor
Heraclius
who
*NL*
entered
Jerusalem
with
the
cross
and
won
the
Holy
Sepulchre
,
like
Godfrey
*NL*
of
Bouillon
,
there
being
years
innumerable
between
the
one
and
the
other
?
*NL*
or
,
if
the
play
is
based
on
fiction
and
historical
facts
are
introduced
,
*NL*
or
bits
of
what
occurred
to
different
people
and
at
different
times
mixed
*NL*
up
with
it
,
all
,
not
only
without
any
semblance
of
probability
,
but
with
*NL*
obvious
errors
that
from
every
point
of
view
are
inexcusable
?
And
the
*NL*
worst
of
it
is
,
there
are
ignorant
people
who
say
that
this
is
*NL*
perfection
,
and
that
anything
beyond
this
is
affected
refinement
.
And
*NL*
then
if
we
turn
to
sacred
dramas
--
what
miracles
they
invent
in
them
!
What
*NL*
apocryphal
,
ill-devised
incidents
,
attributing
to
one
saint
the
miracles
*NL*
of
another
!
And
even
in
secular
plays
they
venture
to
introduce
miracles
*NL*
without
any
reason
or
object
except
that
they
think
some
such
miracle
,
or
*NL*
transformation
as
they
call
it
,
will
come
in
well
to
astonish
stupid
*NL*
people
and
draw
them
to
the
play
.
All
this
tends
to
the
prejudice
of
the
*NL*
truth
and
the
corruption
of
history
,
nay
more
,
to
the
reproach
of
the
*NL*
wits
of
Spain
;
for
foreigners
who
scrupulously
observe
the
laws
of
the
*NL*
drama
look
upon
us
as
barbarous
and
ignorant
,
when
they
see
the
absurdity
*NL*
and
nonsense
of
the
plays
we
produce
.
Nor
will
it
be
a
sufficient
excuse
*NL*
to
say
that
the
chief
object
well-ordered
governments
have
in
view
when
*NL*
they
permit
plays
to
be
performed
in
public
is
to
entertain
the
people
*NL*
with
some
harmless
amusement
occasionally
,
and
keep
it
from
those
evil
*NL*
humours
which
idleness
is
apt
to
engender
;
and
that
,
as
this
may
be
*NL*
attained
by
any
sort
of
play
,
good
or
bad
,
there
is
no
need
to
lay
down
*NL*
laws
,
or
bind
those
who
write
or
act
them
to
make
them
as
they
ought
to
*NL*
be
made
,
since
,
as
I
say
,
the
object
sought
for
may
be
secured
by
any
*NL*
sort
.
To
this
I
would
reply
that
the
same
end
would
be
,
beyond
all
*NL*
comparison
,
better
attained
by
means
of
good
plays
than
by
those
that
are
*NL*
not
so
;
for
after
listening
to
an
artistic
and
properly
constructed
play
,
*NL*
the
hearer
will
come
away
enlivened
by
the
jests
,
instructed
by
the
*NL*
serious
parts
,
full
of
admiration
at
the
incidents
,
his
wits
sharpened
by
*NL*
the
arguments
,
warned
by
the
tricks
,
all
the
wiser
for
the
examples
,
*NL*
inflamed
against
vice
,
and
in
love
with
virtue
;
for
in
all
these
ways
a
*NL*
good
play
will
stimulate
the
mind
of
the
hearer
be
he
ever
so
boorish
or
*NL*
dull
;
and
of
all
impossibilities
the
greatest
is
that
a
play
endowed
with
*NL*
all
these
qualities
will
not
entertain
,
satisfy
,
and
please
much
more
*NL*
than
one
wanting
in
them
,
like
the
greater
number
of
those
which
are
*NL*
commonly
acted
now-a-days
.
Nor
are
the
poets
who
write
them
to
be
blamed
*NL*
for
this
;
for
some
there
are
among
them
who
are
perfectly
well
aware
of
*NL*
their
faults
,
and
know
what
they
ought
to
do
;
but
as
plays
have
become
a
*NL*
salable
commodity
,
they
say
,
and
with
truth
,
that
the
actors
will
not
buy
*NL*
them
unless
they
are
after
this
fashion
;
and
so
the
poet
tries
to
adapt
*NL*
himself
to
the
requirements
of
the
actor
who
is
to
pay
him
for
his
work
.
*NL*
And
that
this
is
the
truth
may
be
seen
by
the
countless
plays
that
a
most
*NL*
fertile
wit
of
these
kingdoms
has
written
,
with
so
much
brilliancy
,
so
*NL*
much
grace
and
gaiety
,
such
polished
versification
,
such
choice
language
,
*NL*
such
profound
reflections
,
and
in
a
word
,
so
rich
in
eloquence
and
*NL*
elevation
of
style
,
that
he
has
filled
the
world
with
his
fame
;
and
yet
,
*NL*
in
consequence
of
his
desire
to
suit
the
taste
of
the
actors
,
they
have
*NL*
not
all
,
as
some
of
them
have
,
come
as
near
perfection
as
they
ought
.
*NL*
Others
write
plays
with
such
heedlessness
that
,
after
they
have
been
*NL*
acted
,
the
actors
have
to
fly
and
abscond
,
afraid
of
being
punished
,
as
*NL*
they
often
have
been
,
for
having
acted
something
offensive
to
some
king
*NL*
or
other
,
or
insulting
to
some
noble
family
.
All
which
evils
,
and
many
*NL*
more
that
I
say
nothing
of
,
would
be
removed
if
there
were
some
*NL*
intelligent
and
sensible
person
at
the
capital
to
examine
all
plays
*NL*
before
they
were
acted
,
not
only
those
produced
in
the
capital
itself
,
*NL*
but
all
that
were
intended
to
be
acted
in
Spain
;
without
whose
approval
,
*NL*
seal
,
and
signature
,
no
local
magistracy
should
allow
any
play
to
be
*NL*
acted
.
In
that
case
actors
would
take
care
to
send
their
plays
to
the
*NL*
capital
,
and
could
act
them
in
safety
,
and
those
who
write
them
would
be
*NL*
more
careful
and
take
more
pains
with
their
work
,
standing
in

of

having
to
submit
it
to
the
strict
examination
of
one
who
understood
the
*NL*
matter
;

so
good
plays
would
be
produced
and
the
objects
they
aim
at
*NL*
happily
attained
;
as
well
the

as
the
credit

the
wits
of
Spain
,
the
interest
and

trouble
in
inflicting
punishment
on
them

And
if
the

some

were
authorised
to
examine
the
newly
written
books
of

chivalry

no

some
would
appear
with
all
the
perfections
you
have
*NL*
described

enriching
our
language
with
the
gracious

precious
treasure
*NL*
of
eloquence

driving

come
out
for
the
harmless
entertainment

of

idle

very

The
canon
and
the
curate
had
proceeded
thus
far
with
their
conversation
,
*NL*
when
the
barber
,
coming
forward
,
joined
them
,
and
said
to
the
curate
,
*NL*
``
This
is
the
spot
,
senor
licentiate
,
that
I
said
was
a
good
one
for
fresh
*NL*
and
plentiful
pasture
for
the
oxen
,
while
we
take
our
noontide
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
it
seems
,
''
returned
the
curate
,
and
he
told
the
canon
what
he
*NL*
proposed
to
do
,
on
which
he
too
made
up
his
mind
to
halt
with
them
,
*NL*
attracted
by
the
aspect
of
the
fair
valley
that
lay
before
their
eyes
;
*NL*
and
to
enjoy
it
as
well
as
the
conversation
of
the
curate
,
to
whom
he
had
*NL*
begun
to
take
a
fancy
,
and
also
to
learn
more
particulars
about
the
*NL*
doings
of
Don
Quixote
,
he
desired
some
of
his
servants
to
go
on
to
the
*NL*
inn
,
which
was
not
far
distant
,
and
fetch
from
it
what
eatables
there
*NL*
might
be
for
the
whole
party
,
as
he
meant
to
rest
for
the
afternoon
where
*NL*
he
was
;
to
which
one
of
his
servants
replied
that
the
sumpter
mule
,
which
*NL*
by
this
time
ought
to
have
reached
the
inn
,
carried
provisions
enough
to
*NL*
make
it
unnecessary
to
get
anything
from
the
inn
except
barley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
the
canon
,
``
take
all
the
beasts
there
,
and
bring
the
*NL*
sumpter
mule
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
going
on
,
Sancho
,
perceiving
that
he
could
speak
to
his
*NL*
master
without
having
the
curate
and
the
barber
,
of
whom
he
had
his
*NL*
suspicions
,
present
all
the
time
,
approached
the
cage
in
which
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
placed
,
and
said
,
``
Senor
,
to
ease
my
conscience
I
want
to
*NL*
tell
you
the
state
of
the
case
as
to
your
enchantment
,
and
that
is
that
*NL*
these
two
here
,
with
their
faces
covered
,
are
the
curate
of
our
village
*NL*
and
the
barber
;
and
I
suspect
they
have
hit
upon
this
plan
of
carrying
*NL*
you
off
in
this
fashion
,
out
of
pure
envy
because
your
worship
surpasses
*NL*
them
in
doing
famous
deeds
;
and
if
this
be
the
truth
it
follows
that
you
*NL*
are
not
enchanted
,
but
hoodwinked
and
made
a
fool
of
.
And
to
prove
this
I
*NL*
want
to
ask
you
one
thing
;
and
if
you
answer
me
as
I
believe
you
will
*NL*
answer
,
you
will
be
able
to
lay
your
finger
on
the
trick
,
and
you
will
*NL*
see
that
you
are
not
enchanted
but
gone
wrong
in
your
wits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
what
thou
wilt
,
Sancho
my
son
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
I
will
*NL*
satisfy
thee
and
answer
all
thou
requirest
.
As
to
what
thou
sayest
,
that
*NL*
these
who
accompany
us
yonder
are
the
curate
and
the
barber
,
our
*NL*
neighbours
and
acquaintances
,
it
is
very
possible
that
they
may
seem
to
*NL*
be
those
same
persons
;
but
that
they
are
so
in
reality
and
in
fact
,
*NL*
believe
it
not
on
any
account
;
what
thou
art
to
believe
and
think
is
*NL*
that
,
if
they
look
like
them
,
as
thou
sayest
,
it
must
be
that
those
who
*NL*
have
enchanted
me
have
taken
this
shape
and
likeness
;
for
it
is
easy
for
*NL*
enchanters
to
take
any
form
they
please
,
and
they
may
have
taken
those
of
*NL*
our
friends
in
order
to
make
thee
think
as
thou
dost
,
and
lead
thee
into
*NL*
a
labyrinth
of
fancies
from
which
thou
wilt
find
no
escape
though
thou
*NL*
hadst
the
cord
of
Theseus
;
and
they
may
also
have
done
it
to
make
me
*NL*
uncertain
in
my
mind
,
and
unable
to
conjecture
whence
this
evil
comes
to
*NL*
me
;
for
if
on
the
one
hand
thou
dost
tell
me
that
the
barber
and
curate
*NL*
of
our
village
are
here
in
company
with
us
,
and
on
the
other
I
find
*NL*
myself
shut
up
in
a
cage
,
and
know
in
my
heart
that
no
power
on
earth
*NL*
that
was
not
supernatural
would
have
been
able
to
shut
me
in
,
what
*NL*
wouldst
thou
have
me
say
or
think
,
but
that
my
enchantment
is
of
a
sort
*NL*
that
transcends
all
I
have
ever
read
of
in
all
the
histories
that
deal
*NL*
with
knights-errant
that
have
been
enchanted
?
So
thou
mayest
set
thy
mind
*NL*
at
rest
as
to
the
idea
that
they
are
what
thou
sayest
,
for
they
are
as
*NL*
much
so
as
I
am
a
Turk
.
But
touching
thy
desire
to
ask
me
something
,
say
*NL*
on
,
and
I
will
answer
thee
,
though
thou
shouldst
ask
questions
from
this
*NL*
till
to-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
Our
Lady
be
good
to
me
!
''
said
Sancho
,
lifting
up
his
voice
;
``
and
is
*NL*
it
possible
that
your
worship
is
so
thick
of
skull
and
so
short
of
brains
*NL*
that
you
can
not
see
that
what
I
say
is
the
simple
truth
,
and
that
malice
*NL*
has
more
to
do
with
your
imprisonment
and
misfortune
than
enchantment
?
*NL*
But
as
it
is
so
,
I
will
prove
plainly
to
you
that
you
are
not
enchanted

*NL*
Now
tell
me
,
so
may
God
deliver
you
from
this
affliction

so
may
you
*NL*
find
yourself
when
you

expect
it

arms
of
my
lady
Dulcinea

*NL*

Leave
off

whether
since

been
shut
up

as
you

enchanted
in

you
have
felt

OF
THE
SHREWD
CONVERSATION
WHICH
SANCHO
PANZA
HELD
WITH
HIS
*NL*
MASTER
DON
QUIXOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
,
I
have
caught
you
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
this
is
what
in
my
heart
and
soul
*NL*
I
was
longing
to
know
.
Come
now
,
senor
,
can
you
deny
what
is
commonly
*NL*
said
around
us
,
when
a
person
is
out
of
humour
,
'
I
do
n't
know
what
ails
*NL*
so-and-so
,
that
he
neither
eats
,
nor
drinks
,
nor
sleeps
,
nor
gives
a
*NL*
proper
answer
to
any
question
;
one
would
think
he
was
enchanted
'
?
From
*NL*
which
it
is
to
be
gathered
that
those
who
do
not
eat
,
or
drink
,
or
sleep
,
*NL*
or
do
any
of
the
natural
acts
I
am
speaking
of-that
such
persons
are
*NL*
enchanted
;
but
not
those
that
have
the
desire
your
worship
has
,
and
drink
*NL*
when
drink
is
given
them
,
and
eat
when
there
is
anything
to
eat
,
and
*NL*
answer
every
question
that
is
asked
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
thou
sayest
is
true
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
I
have
*NL*
already
told
thee
there
are
many
sorts
of
enchantments
,
and
it
may
be
*NL*
that
in
the
course
of
time
they
have
been
changed
one
for
another
,
and
*NL*
that
now
it
may
be
the
way
with
enchanted
people
to
do
all
that
I
do
,
*NL*
though
they
did
not
do
so
before
;
so
it
is
vain
to
argue
or
draw
*NL*
inferences
against
the
usage
of
the
time
.
I
know
and
feel
that
I
am
*NL*
enchanted
,
and
that
is
enough
to
ease
my
conscience
;
for
it
would
weigh
*NL*
heavily
on
it
if
I
thought
that
I
was
not
enchanted
,
and
that
in
a
*NL*
faint-hearted
and
cowardly
way
I
allowed
myself
to
lie
in
this
cage
,
*NL*
defrauding
multitudes
of
the
succour
I
might
afford
to
those
in
need
and
*NL*
distress
,
who
at
this
very
moment
may
be
in
sore
want
of
my
aid
and
*NL*
protection

*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
for
all
that

replied
Sancho
,
``
I
say
that
,
for
your
greater
and
*NL*
fuller
satisfaction
,
it
would
be
well
if
your
worship
were
to
try
to
get
*NL*
out
of
this
prison

I
promise
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
help
,

even
*NL*
to
take
you
out
of
it

and
see
if
you
could
once
more
mount
your
good
*NL*
Rocinante
,
who
seems
to
be
enchanted
too
,
he
is
so
melancholy
and
*NL*
dejected

and
then
we
might
try
our
chance
in
looking
for
adventures
*NL*
again
;
and
if
we
have
no
luck
there
will
be
time
enough
to
go
back
to
the
*NL*
cage
;
in
which
,
on
the
faith
of
a
good
and
loyal
squire
,
I
promise
to
*NL*
shut
myself
up
along
with
your
worship

if
so
be
you
are
so
unfortunate

I
so
stupid

not

be
able

carry
out

plan

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
content
to
do
as
thou
sayest

Sancho

Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
``
and
when
thou
seest
an
opportunity
for
effecting
my
release
I
will
obey
*NL*
thee
absolutely
;
but
thou
wilt
see
,
Sancho
,
how
mistaken
thou
art
in
thy
*NL*
conception
of
my
misfortune

*NL*
*NL*
The
knight-errant
and
the
ill-errant
squire
kept
up
their
conversation
*NL*
till
they
reached
the
place
where
the
curate
,
the
canon
,
and
the
barber
,
*NL*
who
had
already
dismounted
,
were
waiting
for
them
.
The
carter
at
once
*NL*
unyoked
the
oxen
and
left
them
to
roam
at
large
about
the
pleasant
green
*NL*
spot
,
the
freshness
of
which
seemed
to
invite
,
not
enchanted
people
like
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
but
wide-awake
,
sensible
folk
like
his
squire
,
who
begged
*NL*
the
curate
to
allow
his
master
to
leave
the
cage
for
a
little
;
for
if
*NL*
they
did
not
let
him
out
,
the
prison
might
not
be
as
clean
as
the
*NL*
propriety
of
such
a
gentleman
as
his
master
required
.
The
curate
*NL*
understood
him
,
and
said
he
would
very
gladly
comply
with
his
request
,
*NL*
only
that
he
feared
his
master
,
finding
himself
at
liberty
,
would
take
to
*NL*
his
old
courses
and
make
off
where
nobody
could
ever
find
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
answer
for
his
not
running
away
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
also
,
''
said
the
canon
,
``
especially
if
he
gives
me
his
word
as
a
*NL*
knight
not
to
leave
us
without
our
consent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
who
was
listening
to
all
this
,
said
,
``
I
give
it
;
-
moreover
*NL*
one
who
is
enchanted
as
I
am
can
not
do
as
he
likes
with
himself
;
for
he
*NL*
who
had
enchanted
him
could
prevent
his
moving
from
one
place
for
three
*NL*
ages
,
and
if
he
attempted
to
escape
would
bring
him
back
flying
.
''
--
And
*NL*
that
being
so
,
they
might
as
well
release
him
,
particularly
as
it
would
*NL*
be
to
the
advantage
of
all
;
for
,
if
they
did
not
let
him
out
,
he
*NL*
protested
he
would
be
unable
to
avoid
offending
their
nostrils
unless
*NL*
they
kept
their
distance

*NL*
*NL*
The
canon
took
his
hand
,
tied
together
as
they
both
were
,
and
on
his
word
*NL*
and
promise
they
unbound
him
,
and
rejoiced
beyond
measure
he
was
to
find
*NL*
himself
out
of
the
cage
.
The
first
thing
he
did
was
to
stretch
himself
*NL*
all
over
,
and
then
he
went
to
where
Rocinante
was
standing
and
giving
him
*NL*
a
couple
of
slaps
on
the
haunches
said
,
``
I
still
trust
in
God
and
in
his
*NL*
blessed
mother
,
O
flower
and
mirror
of
steeds
,
that
we
shall
soon
see
*NL*
ourselves
,
both
of
us
,
as
we
wish
to
be
,
thou
with
thy
master
on
thy
*NL*
back
,
and
I
mounted
upon
thee
,
following
the
calling
for
which
God
sent
*NL*
me
into
the
world
.
''
And
so
saying
,
accompanied
by
Sancho
,
he
withdrew
to
*NL*
a
retired
spot
,
from
which
he
came
back
much
relieved
and
more
eager
than
*NL*
ever
to
put
his
squire
's
scheme
into
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
canon
gazed
at
him
,
wondering
at
the
extraordinary
nature
of
his
*NL*
madness
,
and
that
in
all
his
remarks
and
replies
he
should
show
such
*NL*
excellent
sense
,
and
only
lose
his
stirrups
,
as
has
been
already
said
,
*NL*
when
the
subject
of
chivalry
was
broached
.
And
so
,
moved
by
compassion
,
*NL*
he
said
to
him
,
as
they
all
sat
on
the
green
grass
awaiting
the
arrival
*NL*
of
the
provisions
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
gentle
sir
,
that
the
nauseous
and
idle
reading
of
books
*NL*
of
chivalry
can
have
had
such
an
effect
on
your
worship
as
to
upset
your
*NL*
reason
so
that
you
fancy
yourself
enchanted
,
and
the
like
,
all
as
far
*NL*
from
the
truth
as
falsehood
itself
is
?
How
can
there
be
any
human
*NL*
understanding
that
can
persuade
itself
there
ever
was
all
that
infinity
*NL*
of
Amadises
in
the
world
,
or
all
that
multitude
of
famous
knights
,
all
*NL*
those
emperors
of
Trebizond
,
all
those
Felixmartes
of
Hircania
,
all
those
*NL*
palfreys
,
and
damsels-errant
,
and
serpents
,
and
monsters
,
and
giants
,
and
*NL*
marvellous
adventures
,
and
enchantments
of
every
kind
,
and
battles
,
and
*NL*
prodigious
encounters
,
splendid
costumes
,
love-sick
princesses
,
squires
*NL*
made
counts
,
droll
dwarfs
,
love
letters
,
billings
and
cooings
,
*NL*
swashbuckler
women
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
all
that
nonsense
the
books
of
*NL*
chivalry
contain
?
For
myself
,
I
can
only
say
that
when
I
read
them
,
so
*NL*
long
as
I
do
not
stop
to
think
that
they
are
all
lies
and
frivolity
,
they
*NL*
give
me
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
;
but
when
I
come
to
consider
what
*NL*
they
are
,
I
fling
the
very
best
of
them
at
the
wall
,
and
would
fling
it
*NL*
into
the
fire
if
there
were
one
at
hand
,
as
richly
deserving
such
*NL*
punishment
as
cheats
and
impostors
out
of
the
range
of
ordinary
*NL*
toleration
,
and
as
founders
of
new
sects
and
modes
of
life
,
and
teachers
*NL*
that
lead
the
ignorant
public
to
believe
and
accept
as
truth
all
the
*NL*
folly
they
contain
.
And
such
is
their
audacity
,
they
even
dare
to
*NL*
unsettle
the
wits
of
gentlemen
of
birth
and
intelligence
,
as
is
shown
*NL*
plainly
by
the
way
they
have
served
your
worship
,
when
they
have
brought
*NL*
you
to
such
a
pass
that
you
have
to
be
shut
up
in
a
cage
and
carried
on
*NL*
an
ox-cart
as
one
would
carry
a
lion
or
a
tiger
from
place
to
place
to
*NL*
make
money
by
showing
it
.
Come
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
have
some
compassion
*NL*
for
yourself
,
return
to
the
bosom
of
common
sense
,
and
make
use
of
the
*NL*
liberal
share
of
it
that
heaven
has
been
pleased
to
bestow
upon
you
,
*NL*
employing
your
abundant
gifts
of
mind
in
some
other
reading
that
may
*NL*
serve
to
benefit
your
conscience
and
add
to
your
honour
.
And
if
,
still
*NL*
led
away
by
your
natural
bent
,
you
desire
to
read
books
of
achievements
*NL*
and
of
chivalry
,
read
the
Book
of
Judges
in
the
Holy
Scriptures
,
for
*NL*
there
you
will
find
grand
reality
,
and
deeds
as
true
as
they
are
heroic

''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
to
the
canon
's
words
,
*NL*
and
when
he
found
he
had
finished
,
after
regarding
him
for
some
time
,
he
*NL*
replied
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
to
me
,
gentle
sir
,
that
your
worship
's
discourse
is
intended
*NL*
to
persuade
me
that
there
never
were
any
knights-errant
in
the
world
,
and
*NL*
that
all
the
books
of
chivalry
are
false
,
lying
,
mischievous
and
useless
*NL*
to
the
State
,
and
that
I
have
done
wrong
in
reading
them
,
and
worse
in
*NL*
believing
them
,
and
still
worse
in
imitating
them
,
when
I
undertook
to
*NL*
follow
the
arduous
calling
of
knight-errantry
which
they
set
forth
;
for
*NL*
you
deny
that
there
ever
were
Amadises
of
Gaul
or
of
Greece
,
or
any
other
*NL*
of
the
knights
of
whom
the
books
are
full
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
exactly
as
you
state
it
,
''
said
the
canon
;
to
which
Don
Quixote
*NL*
returned
,
``
You
also
went
on
to
say
that
books
of
this
kind
had
done
me
*NL*
much
harm
,
inasmuch
as
they
had
upset
my
senses
,
and
shut
me
up
in
a
*NL*
cage
,
and
that
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
reform
and
change
my
studies
,
*NL*
and
read
other
truer
books
which
would
afford
more
pleasure
and
*NL*
instruction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
said
the
canon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
to
my
mind
it
is
you
who
are
the
one
*NL*
that
is
out
of
his
wits
and
enchanted
,
as
you
have
ventured
to
utter
such
*NL*
blasphemies
against
a
thing
so
universally
acknowledged
and
accepted
as
*NL*
true
that
whoever
denies
it
,
as
you
do
,
deserves
the
same
punishment
*NL*
which
you
say
you
inflict
on
the
books
that
irritate
you
when
you
read
*NL*
them
.
For
to
try
to
persuade
anybody
that
Amadis
,
and
all
the
other
*NL*
knights-adventurers
with
whom
the
books
are
filled
,
never
existed
,
would
*NL*
be
like
trying
to
persuade
him
that
the
sun
does
not
yield
light
,
or
ice
*NL*
cold
,
or
earth
nourishment
.
What
wit
in
the
world
can
persuade
another
*NL*
that
the
story
of
the
Princess
Floripes
and
Guy
of
Burgundy
is
not
true
,
*NL*
or
that
of
Fierabras
and
the
bridge
of
Mantible
,
which
happened
in
the
*NL*
time
of
Charlemagne
?
For
by
all
that
is
good
it
is
as
true
as
that
it
is
*NL*
daylight
now
;
and
if
it
be
a
lie
,
it
must
be
a
lie
too
that
there
was
a
*NL*
Hector
,
or
Achilles
,
or
Trojan
war
,
or
Twelve
Peers
of
France
,
or
Arthur
*NL*
of
England
,
who
still
lives
changed
into
a
raven
,
and
is
unceasingly
*NL*
looked
for
in
his
kingdom
.
One
might
just
as
well
try
to
make
out
that
*NL*
the
history
of
Guarino
Mezquino
,
or
of
the
quest
of
the
Holy
Grail
,
is
*NL*
false
,
or
that
the
loves
of
Tristram
and
the
Queen
Yseult
are
apocryphal
,
*NL*
as
well
as
those
of
Guinevere
and
Lancelot
,
when
there
are
persons
who
*NL*
can
almost
remember
having
seen
the
Dame
Quintanona
,
who
was
the
best
*NL*
cupbearer
in
Great
Britain
.
And
so
true
is
this
,
that
I
recollect
a
*NL*
grandmother
of
mine
on
the
father
's
side
,
whenever
she
saw
any
dame
in
a
*NL*
venerable
hood
,
used
to
say
to
me
,
`
Grandson
,
that
one
is
like
Dame
*NL*
Quintanona
,
'
from
which
I
conclude
that
she
must
have
known
her
,
or
at
*NL*
least
had
managed
to
see
some
portrait
of
her
.
Then
who
can
deny
that
the
*NL*
story
of
Pierres
and
the
fair
Magalona
is
true
,
when
even
to
this
day
may
*NL*
be
seen
in
the
king
's
armoury
the
pin
with
which
the
valiant
Pierres
*NL*
guided
the
wooden
horse
he
rode
through
the
air
,
and
it
is
a
trifle
*NL*
bigger
than
the
pole
of
a
cart
?
And
alongside
of
the
pin
is
Babieca
's
*NL*
saddle
,
and
at
Roncesvalles
there
is
Roland
's
horn
,
as
large
as
a
large
*NL*
beam
;
whence
we
may
infer
that
there
were
Twelve
Peers
,
and
a
Pierres
,
*NL*
and
a
Cid
,
and
other
knights
like
them
,
of
the
sort
people
commonly
call
*NL*
adventurers
.
Or
perhaps
I
shall
be
told
,
too
,
that
there
was
no
such
*NL*
knight-errant
as
the
valiant
Lusitanian
Juan
de
Merlo
,
who
went
to
*NL*
Burgundy
and
in
the
city
of
Arras
fought
with
the
famous
lord
of
Charny
,
*NL*
Mosen
Pierres
by
name
,
and
afterwards
in
the
city
of
Basle
with
Mosen
*NL*
Enrique
de
Remesten
,
coming
out
of
both
encounters
covered
with
fame
and
*NL*
honour
;
or
adventures
and
challenges
achieved
and
delivered
,
also
in
*NL*
Burgundy
,
by
the
valiant
Spaniards
Pedro
Barba
and
Gutierre
Quixada
-LRB-
of
*NL*
whose
family
I
come
in
the
direct
male
line
-RRB-
,
when
they
vanquished
the
*NL*
sons
of
the
Count
of
San
Polo
.
I
shall
be
told
,
too
,
that
Don
Fernando
de
*NL*
Guevara
did
not
go
in
quest
of
adventures
to
Germany
,
where
he
engaged
in
*NL*
combat
with
Micer
George
,
a
knight
of
the
house
of
the
Duke
of
Austria
.
I
*NL*
shall
be
told
that
the
jousts
of
Suero
de
Quinones
,
him
of
the
`
Paso
,
'
*NL*
and
the
emprise
of
Mosen
Luis
de
Falces
against
the
Castilian
knight
,
Don
*NL*
Gonzalo
de
Guzman
,
were
mere
mockeries
;
as
well
as
many
other
*NL*
achievements
of
Christian
knights
of
these
and
foreign
realms
,
which
are
*NL*
so
authentic
and
true
,
that
,
I
repeat
,
he
who
denies
them
must
be
totally
*NL*
wanting
in
reason
and
good
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
canon
was
amazed
to
hear
the
medley
of
truth
and
fiction
Don
Quixote
*NL*
uttered
,
and
to
see
how
well
acquainted
he
was
with
everything
relating
*NL*
or
belonging
to
the
achievements
of
his
knight-errantry
;
so
he
said
in
*NL*
reply
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
deny
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
that
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
*NL*
say
,
especially
as
regards
the
Spanish
knights-errant
;
and
I
am
willing
*NL*
to
grant
too
that
the
Twelve
Peers
of
France
existed
,
but
I
am
not
*NL*
disposed
to
believe
that
they
did
all
the
things
that
the
Archbishop
*NL*
Turpin
relates
of
them
.
For
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
they
were
knights
*NL*
chosen
by
the
kings
of
France
,
and
called
`
Peers
'
because
they
were
all
*NL*
equal
in
worth
,
rank
and
prowess
-LRB-
at
least
if
they
were
not
they
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
-RRB-
,
and
it
was
a
kind
of
religious
order
like
those
of
Santiago
*NL*
and
Calatrava
in
the
present
day
,
in
which
it
is
assumed
that
those
who
*NL*
take
it
are
valiant
knights
of
distinction
and
good
birth
;
and
just
as
we
*NL*
say
now
a
Knight
of
St.
John
,
or
of
Alcantara
,
they
used
to
say
then
a
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Twelve
Peers
,
because
twelve
equals
were
chosen
for
that
*NL*
military
order
.
That
there
was
a
Cid
,
as
well
as
a
Bernardo
del
Carpio
,
*NL*
there
can
be
no
doubt
;
but
that
they
did
the
deeds
people
say
they
did
,
I
*NL*
hold
to
be
very
doubtful
.
In
that
other
matter
of
the
pin
of
Count
*NL*
Pierres
that
you
speak
of
,
and
say
is
near
Babieca
's
saddle
in
the
*NL*
Armoury
,
I
confess
my
sin
;
for
I
am
either
so
stupid
or
so
short-sighted
,
*NL*
that
,
though
I
have
seen
the
saddle
,
I
have
never
been
able
to
see
the
*NL*
pin
,
in
spite
of
it
being
as
big
as
your
worship
says
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
it
is
there
,
without
any
manner
of
doubt
,
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
``
and
more
by
token
they
say
it
is
inclosed
in
a
sheath
of
*NL*
cowhide
to
keep
it
from
rusting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
may
be

replied
the
canon
;
``
but
,
by
the
orders
I
have

received

I
do
not
remember
seeing

However
,

it
is
there

*NL*

so
worthy

with
so
many

endowed
with

those
to
whom
they
*NL*
have
been
submitted
,
and
read
with
universal
delight
,
and
extolled
by
*NL*
great
and
small
,
rich
and
poor
,
learned
and
ignorant
,
gentle
and
simple
,
*NL*
in
a
word
by
people
of
every
sort
,
of
whatever
rank
or
condition
they
may
*NL*
be
--
that
these
should
be
lies
!
And
above
all
when
they
carry
such
an
*NL*
appearance
of
truth
with
them
;
for
they
tell
us
the
father
,
mother
,
*NL*
country
,
kindred
,
age
,
place
,
and
the
achievements
,
step
by
step
,
and
day
*NL*
by
day
,
performed
by
such
a
knight
or
knights
!
Hush
,
sir
;
utter
not
such
*NL*
blasphemy
;
trust
me
I
am
advising
you
now
to
act
as
a
sensible
man
*NL*
should
;
only
read
them
,
and
you
will
see
the
pleasure
you
will
derive
*NL*
from
them
.
For
,
come
,
tell
me
,
can
there
be
anything
more
delightful
than
*NL*
to
see
,
as
it
were
,
here
now
displayed
before
us
a
vast
lake
of
bubbling
*NL*
pitch
with
a
host
of
snakes
and
serpents
and
lizards
,
and
ferocious
and
*NL*
terrible
creatures
of
all
sorts
swimming
about
in
it
,
while
from
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
lake
there
comes
a
plaintive
voice
saying
:
`
Knight
,
*NL*
whosoever
thou
art
who
beholdest
this
dread
lake
,
if
thou
wouldst
win
the
*NL*
prize
that
lies
hidden
beneath
these
dusky
waves
,
prove
the
valour
of
thy
*NL*
stout
heart
and
cast
thyself
into
the
midst
of
its
dark
burning
waters
,
*NL*
else
thou
shalt
not
be
worthy
to
see
the
mighty
wonders
contained
in
the
*NL*
seven
castles
of
the
seven
Fays
that
lie
beneath
this
black
expanse
;
'
and
*NL*
then
the
knight
,
almost
ere
the
awful
voice
has
ceased
,
without
stopping
*NL*
to
consider
,
without
pausing
to
reflect
upon
the
danger
to
which
he
is
*NL*
exposing
himself
,
without
even
relieving
himself
of
the
weight
of
his
*NL*
massive
armour
,
commending
himself
to
God
and
to
his
lady
,
plunges
into
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
boiling
lake
,
and
when
he
little
looks
for
it
,
or
knows
*NL*
what
his
fate
is
to
be
,
he
finds
himself
among
flowery
meadows
,
with
*NL*
which
the
Elysian
fields
are
not
to
be
compared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sky
seems
more
transparent
there
,
and
the
sun
shines
with
a
strange
*NL*
brilliancy
,
and
a
delightful
grove
of
green
leafy
trees
presents
itself
*NL*
to
the
eyes
and
charms
the
sight
with
its
verdure
,
while
the
ear
is
*NL*
soothed
by
the
sweet
untutored
melody
of
the
countless
birds
of
gay
*NL*
plumage
that
flit
to
and
fro
among
the
interlacing
branches
.
Here
he
sees
*NL*
a
brook
whose
limpid
waters
,
like
liquid
crystal
,
ripple
over
fine
sands
*NL*
and
white
pebbles
that
look
like
sifted
gold
and
purest
pearls
.
There
he
*NL*
perceives
a
cunningly
wrought
fountain
of
many-coloured
jasper
and
*NL*
polished
marble
;
here
another
of
rustic
fashion
where
the
little
*NL*
mussel-shells
and
the
spiral
white
and
yellow
mansions
of
the
snail
*NL*
disposed
in
studious
disorder
,
mingled
with
fragments
of
glittering
*NL*
crystal
and
mock
emeralds
,
make
up
a
work
of
varied
aspect
,
where
art
,
*NL*
imitating
nature
,
seems
to
have
outdone
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suddenly
there
is
presented
to
his
sight
a
strong
castle
or
gorgeous
*NL*
palace
with
walls
of
massy
gold
,
turrets
of
diamond
and
gates
of
jacinth
;
*NL*
in
short
,
so
marvellous
is
its
structure
that
though
the
materials
of
*NL*
which
it
is
built
are
nothing
less
than
diamonds
,
carbuncles
,
rubies
,
*NL*
pearls
,
gold
,
and
emeralds
,
the
workmanship
is
still
more
rare
.
And
after
*NL*
having
seen
all
this
,
what
can
be
more
charming
than
to
see
how
a
bevy
of
*NL*
damsels
comes
forth
from
the
gate
of
the
castle
in
gay
and
gorgeous
*NL*
attire
,
such
that
,
were
I
to
set
myself
now
to
depict
it
as
the
histories
*NL*
describe
it
to
us
,
I
should
never
have
done
;
and
then
how
she
who
seems
*NL*
to
be
the
first
among
them
all
takes
the
bold
knight
who
plunged
into
the
*NL*
boiling
lake
by
the
hand
,
and
without
addressing
a
word
to
him
leads
him
*NL*
into
the
rich
palace
or
castle
,
and
strips
him
as
naked
as
when
his
*NL*
mother
bore
him
,
and
bathes
him
in
lukewarm
water
,
and
anoints
him
all
*NL*
over
with
sweet-smelling
unguents
,
and
clothes
him
in
a
shirt
of
the
*NL*
softest
sendal
,
all
scented
and
perfumed
,
while
another
damsel
comes
and
*NL*
throws
over
his
shoulders
a
mantle
which
is
said
to
be
worth
at
the
very
*NL*
least
a
city
,
and
even
more
?
How
charming
it
is
,
then
,
when
they
tell
us
*NL*
how
,
after
all
this
,
they
lead
him
to
another
chamber
where
he
finds
the
*NL*
tables
set
out
in
such
style
that
he
is
filled
with
amazement
and
wonder
;
*NL*
to
see
how
they
pour
out
water
for
his
hands
distilled
from
amber
and
*NL*
sweet-scented
flowers
;
how
they
seat
him
on
an
ivory
chair
;
to
see
how
*NL*
the
damsels
wait
on
him
all
in
profound
silence
;
how
they
bring
him
such
*NL*
a
variety
of
dainties
so
temptingly
prepared
that
the
appetite
is
at
a
*NL*
loss
which
to
select
;
to
hear
the
music
that
resounds
while
he
is
at
*NL*
table
,
by
whom
or
whence
produced
he
knows
not
.
And
then
when
the
repast
*NL*
is
over
and
the
tables
removed
,
for
the
knight
to
recline
in
the
chair
,
*NL*
picking
his
teeth
perhaps
as
usual
,
and
a
damsel
,
much
lovelier
than
any
*NL*
of
the
others
,
to
enter
unexpectedly
by
the
chamber
door
,
and
herself
by
*NL*
his
side
,
and
begin
to
tell
him
what
the
castle
is
,
and
how
she
is
held
*NL*
enchanted
there
,
and
other
things
that
amaze
the
knight
and
astonish
the
*NL*
readers
who
are
perusing
his
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
will
not
expatiate
any
further
upon
this
,
as
it
may
be
gathered
*NL*
from
it
that
whatever
part
of
whatever
history
of
a
knight-errant
one
*NL*
reads
,
it
will
fill
the
reader
,
whoever
he
be
,
with
delight
and
wonder
;
*NL*
and
take
my
advice
,
sir
,
and
,
as
I
said
before
,
read
these
books
and
you
*NL*
will
see
how
they
will
banish
any
melancholy
you
may
feel
and
raise
your
*NL*
spirits
should
they
be
depressed
.
For
myself
I
can
say
that
since
I
have
*NL*
been
a
knight-errant
I
have
become
valiant
,
polite
,
generous
,
well-bred
,
*NL*
magnanimous
,
courteous
,
dauntless
,
gentle
,
patient
,
and
have
learned
to
*NL*
bear
hardships
,
imprisonments
,
and
enchantments
;
and
though
it
be
such
a
*NL*
short
time
since
I
have
seen
myself
shut
up
in
a
cage
like
a
madman
,
I
*NL*
hope
by
the
might
of
my
arm
,
if
heaven
aid
me
and
fortune
thwart
me
not
,
*NL*
to
see
myself
king
of
some
kingdom
where
I
may
be
able
to
show
the
*NL*
gratitude
and
generosity
that
dwell
in
my
heart
;
for
by
my
faith
,
senor
,
*NL*
the
poor
man
is
incapacitated
from
showing
the
virtue
of
generosity
to
*NL*
anyone
,
though
he
may
possess
it
in
the
highest
degree
;
and
gratitude
*NL*
that
consists
of
disposition
only
is
a
dead
thing
,
just
as
faith
without
*NL*
works
is
dead
.
For
this
reason
I
should
be
glad
were
fortune
soon
to
*NL*
offer
me
some
opportunity
of
making
myself
an
emperor
,
so
as
to
show
my
*NL*
heart
in
doing
good
to
my
friends
,
particularly
to
this
poor
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
,
my
squire
,
who
is
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
;
and
I
would
gladly
*NL*
give
him
a
county
I
have
promised
him
this
ever
so
long
,
only
that
I
am
*NL*
afraid
he
has
not
the
capacity
to
govern
his
realm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
partly
heard
these
last
words
of
his
master
,
and
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Strive
hard
you
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
to
give
me
that
county
so
often
*NL*
promised
by
you
and
so
long
looked
for
by
me
,
for
I
promise
you
there
*NL*
will
be
no
want
of
capacity
in
me
to
govern
it
;
and
even
if
there
is
,
I
*NL*
have
heard
say
there
are
men
in
the
world
who
farm
seigniories
,
paying
so
*NL*
much
a
year
,
and
they
themselves
taking
charge
of
the
government
,
while
*NL*
the
lord
,
with
his
legs
stretched
out
,
enjoys
the
revenue
they
pay
him
,
*NL*
without
troubling
himself
about
anything
else
.
That
's
what
I
'll
do
,
and
*NL*
not
stand
haggling
over
trifles
,
but
wash
my
hands
at
once
of
the
whole
*NL*
business
,
and
enjoy
my
rents
like
a
duke
,
and
let
things
go
their
own
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
brother
Sancho
,
''
said
the
canon
,
``
only
holds
good
as
far
as
the
*NL*
enjoyment
of
the
revenue
goes
;
but
the
lord
of
the
seigniory
must
attend
*NL*
to
the
administration
of
justice
,
and
here
capacity
and
sound
judgment
*NL*
come
in
,
and
above
all
a
firm
determination
to
find
out
the
truth
;
for
if
*NL*
this
be
wanting
in
the
beginning
,
the
middle
and
the
end
will
always
go
*NL*
wrong
;
and
God
as
commonly
aids
the
honest
intentions
of
the
simple
as
he
*NL*
frustrates
the
evil
designs
of
the
crafty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
those
philosophies
,
''
returned
Sancho
Panza
;
``
all
I
*NL*
know
is
I
would
I
had
the
county
as
soon
as
I
shall
know
how
to
govern
*NL*
it
;
for
I
have
as
much
soul
as
another
,
and
as
much
body
as
anyone
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
be
as
much
king
of
my
realm
as
any
other
of
his
;
and
being
so
I
*NL*
should
do
as
I
liked
,
and
doing
as
I
liked
I
should
please
myself
,
and
*NL*
pleasing
myself
I
should
be
content
,
and
when
one
is
content
he
has
*NL*
nothing
more
to
desire
,
and
when
one
has
nothing
more
to
desire
there
is
*NL*
an
end
of
it
;
so
let
the
county
come
,
and
God
be
with
you
,
and
let
us
see
*NL*
one
another
,
as
one
blind
man
said
to
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
bad
philosophy
thou
art
talking
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
canon
;
*NL*
``
but
for
all
that
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
this
matter
of
*NL*
counties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
returned
,
``
I
know
not
what
more
there
is
to
be
said
;
*NL*
I
only
guide
myself
by
the
example
set
me
by
the
great
Amadis
of
Gaul
,
*NL*
when
he
made
his
squire
count
of
the
Insula
Firme
;
and
so
,
without
any
*NL*
scruples
of
conscience
,
I
can
make
a
count
of
Sancho
Panza
,
for
he
is
one
*NL*
of
the
best
squires
that
ever
knight-errant
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
canon
was
astonished
at
the
methodical
nonsense
-LRB-
if
nonsense
be
*NL*
capable
of
method
-RRB-
that
Don
Quixote
uttered
,
at
the
way
in
which
he
had
*NL*
described
the
adventure
of
the
knight
of
the
lake
,
at
the
impression
that
*NL*
the
deliberate
lies
of
the
books
he
read
had
made
upon
him
,
and
lastly
he
*NL*
marvelled
at
the
simplicity
of
Sancho
,
who
desired
so
eagerly
to
obtain
*NL*
the
county
his
master
had
promised
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
canon
's
servants
,
who
had
gone
to
the
inn
to
fetch
the
*NL*
sumpter
mule
,
had
returned
,
and
making
a
carpet
and
the
green
grass
of
*NL*
the
meadow
serve
as
a
table
,
they
seated
themselves
in
the
shade
of
some
*NL*
trees
and
made
their
repast
there
,
that
the
carter
might
not
be
deprived
*NL*
of
the
advantage
of
the
spot
,
as
has
been
already
said
.
As
they
were
*NL*
eating
they
suddenly
heard
a
loud
noise
and
the
sound
of
a
bell
that
*NL*
seemed
to
come
from
among
some
brambles
and
thick
bushes
that
were
close
*NL*
by
,
and
the
same
instant
they
observed
a
beautiful
goat
,
spotted
all
over
*NL*
black
,
white
,
and
brown
,
spring
out
of
the
thicket
with
a
goatherd
after
*NL*
it
,
calling
to
it
and
uttering
the
usual
cries
to
make
it
stop
or
turn
*NL*
back
to
the
fold
.
The
fugitive
goat
,
scared
and
frightened
,
ran
towards
*NL*
the
company
as
if
seeking
their
protection
and
then
stood
still
,
and
the
*NL*
goatherd
coming
up
seized
it
by
the
horns
and
began
to
talk
to
it
as
if
*NL*
it
were
possessed
of
reason
and
understanding
:
``
Ah
wanderer
,
wanderer
,
*NL*
Spotty
,
Spotty
;
how
have
you
gone
limping
all
this
time
?
What
wolves
have
*NL*
frightened
you
,
my
daughter
?
Wo
n't
you
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
,
my
*NL*
beauty
?
But
what
else
can
it
be
except
that
you
are
a
she
,
and
can
not
*NL*
keep
quiet
?
A
plague
on
your
humours
and
the
humours
of
those
you
take
*NL*
after
!
Come
back
,
come
back
,
my
darling
;
and
if
you
will
not
be
so
happy
,
*NL*
at
any
rate
you
will
be
safe
in
the
fold
or
with
your
companions
;
for
if
*NL*
you
who
ought
to
keep
and
lead
them
,
go
wandering
astray
,
what
will
*NL*
become
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goatherd
's
talk
amused
all
who
heard
it
,
but
especially
the
canon
,
*NL*
who
said
to
him
,
``
As
you
live
,
brother
,
take
it
easy
,
and
be
not
in
such
*NL*
a
hurry
to
drive
this
goat
back
to
the
fold
;
for
,
being
a
female
,
as
you
*NL*
say
,
she
will
follow
her
natural
instinct
in
spite
of
all
you
can
do
to
*NL*
prevent
it
.
Take
this
morsel
and
drink
a
sup
,
and
that
will
soothe
your
*NL*
irritation
,
and
in
the
meantime
the
goat
will
rest
herself
,
''
and
so
*NL*
saying
,
he
handed
him
the
loins
of
a
cold
rabbit
on
a
fork
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
goatherd
took
it
with
thanks
,
and
drank
and
calmed
himself
,
and
then
*NL*
said
,
``
I
should
be
sorry
if
your
worships
were
to
take
me
for
a
simpleton
*NL*
for
having
spoken
so
seriously
as
I
did
to
this
animal
;
but
the
truth
is
*NL*
there
is
a
certain
mystery
in
the
words
I
used
.
I
am
a
clown
,
but
not
so
*NL*
much
of
one
but
that
I
know
how
to
behave
to
men
and
to
beasts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
well
believe
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
for
I
know
already
by
*NL*
experience
that
the
woods
breed
men
of
learning
,
and
shepherds
'
harbour
*NL*
philosophers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
senor
,
''
returned
the
goatherd
,
``
they
shelter
men
of
*NL*
experience
;
and
that
you
may
see
the
truth
of
this
and
grasp
it
,
though
I
*NL*
may
seem
to
put
myself
forward
without
being
asked
,
I
will
,
if
it
will
*NL*
not
tire
you
,
gentlemen
,
and
you
will
give
me
your
attention
for
a
*NL*
little
,
tell
you
a
true
story
which
will
confirm
this
gentleman
's
word
*NL*
-LRB-
and
he
pointed
to
the
curate
-RRB-
as
well
as
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
Seeing
that
this
affair
has
a
certain
*NL*
colour
of
chivalry
about
it
,
I
for
my
part
,
brother
,
will
hear
you
most
*NL*
gladly
,
and
so
will
all
these
gentlemen
,
from
the
high
intelligence
they
*NL*
possess
and
their
love
of
curious
novelties
that
interest
,
charm
,
and
*NL*
entertain
the
mind
,
as
I
feel
quite
sure
your
story
will
do
.
So
begin

*NL*

,
for
we
are
all
prepared
to
listen

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
draw
my
stakes

''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
will
retreat
with
this
pasty
to
the
*NL*
brook
there
,
where
I
mean
to
victual
myself

three
days
;
for
I
have
*NL*
heard
my
lord

Don

,
say
that
a
knight-errant
's
squire
should
eat
*NL*
until
he
can
hold
no
more

whenever
he
has
the
chance

it
often

them

wood

thick

they

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
in
the
right
of
it

Sancho

said
Don
Quixote
;
``
go
where
thou
*NL*
wilt
and
eat
all
thou
canst

for
I
have
had
enough
,
and
only
want
to
give
*NL*
my
mind
its
refreshment

as
I
shall
by
listening
to
this
good

*NL*
story

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
what
we
shall
all
do
,
''
said
the
canon
;
and
then
begged
the
*NL*
goatherd
to
begin
the
promised
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
goatherd
gave
the
goat
which
he
held
by
the
horns
a
couple
of
slaps
*NL*
on
the
back
,
saying
,
``
Lie
down
here
beside
me

Spotty
,
for
we
have
time
*NL*
enough
to
return

The
goat
seemed
to
understand
him
,
for
as
*NL*
her
master
seated
himself
,
she
stretched
herself
quietly
beside
him
and
*NL*
looked
up
in
his
face
to
show
him
she
was
all
attention
to
what
he
was
*NL*
going
to
say
,
and
then
in
these
words
he
began
his

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
DEALS
WITH
WHAT
THE
GOATHERD
TOLD
THOSE
WHO
WERE
CARRYING
OFF
DON
*NL*
QUIXOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Three
leagues
from
this
valley
there
is
a
village
which
,
though
small
,
is
*NL*
one
of
the
richest
in
all
this
neighbourhood
,
and
in
it
there
lived
a
*NL*
farmer
,
a
very
worthy
man
,
and
so
much
respected
that
,
although
to
be
so
*NL*
is
the
natural
consequence
of
being
rich
,
he
was
even
more
respected
for
*NL*
his
virtue
than
for
the
wealth
he
had
acquired
.
But
what
made
him
still
*NL*
more
fortunate
,
as
he
said
himself
,
was
having
a
daughter
of
such
*NL*
exceeding
beauty
,
rare
intelligence
,
gracefulness
,
and
virtue
,
that
*NL*
everyone
who
knew
her
and
beheld
her
marvelled
at
the
extraordinary
gifts
*NL*
with
which
heaven
and
nature
had
endowed
her
.
As
a
child
she
was
*NL*
beautiful
,
she
continued
to
grow
in
beauty
,
and
at
the
age
of
sixteen
she
*NL*
was
most
lovely
.
The
fame
of
her
beauty
began
to
spread
abroad
through
*NL*
all
the
villages
around
--
but
why
do
I
say
the
villages
around
,
merely
,
*NL*
when
it
spread
to
distant
cities
,
and
even
made
its
way
into
the
halls
of
*NL*
royalty
and
reached
the
ears
of
people
of
every
class
,
who
came
from
all
*NL*
sides
to
see
her
as
if
to
see
something
rare
and
curious
,
or
some
*NL*
wonder-working
image
?
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
watched
over
her
and
she
watched
over
herself
;
for
there
are
*NL*
no
locks
,
or
guards
,
or
bolts
that
can
protect
a
young
girl
better
than
*NL*
her
own
modesty
.
The
wealth
of
the
father
and
the
beauty
of
the
daughter
*NL*
led
many
neighbours
as
well
as
strangers
to
seek
her
for
a
wife
;
but
he
,
*NL*
as
one
might
well
be
who
had
the
disposal
of
so
rich
a
jewel
,
was
*NL*
perplexed
and
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
which
of
her
countless
*NL*
suitors
he
should
entrust
her
.
I
was
one
among
the
many
who
felt
a
desire
*NL*
so
natural
,
and
,
as
her
father
knew
who
I
was
,
and
I
was
of
the
same
*NL*
town
,
of
pure
blood
,
in
the
bloom
of
life
,
and
very
rich
in
possessions
,
*NL*
I
had
great
hopes
of
success
.
There
was
another
of
the
same
place
and
*NL*
qualifications
who
also
sought
her
,
and
this
made
her
father
's
choice
*NL*
hang
in
the
balance
,
for
he
felt
that
on
either
of
us
his
daughter
would
*NL*
be
well
bestowed
;
so
to
escape
from
this
state
of
perplexity
he
resolved
*NL*
to
refer
the
matter
to
Leandra
-LRB-
for
that
is
the
name
of
the
rich
damsel
*NL*
who
has
reduced
me
to
misery
-RRB-
,
reflecting
that
as
we
were
both
equal
it
*NL*
would
be
best
to
leave
it
to
his
dear
daughter
to
choose
according
to
her
*NL*
inclination
--
a
course
that
is
worthy
of
imitation
by
all
fathers
who
wish
*NL*
to
settle
their
children
in
life
.
I
do
not
mean
that
they
ought
to
leave
*NL*
them
to
make
a
choice
of
what
is
contemptible
and
bad
,
but
that
they
*NL*
should
place
before
them
what
is
good
and
then
allow
them
to
make
a
good
*NL*
choice
as
they
please
.
I
do
not
know
which
Leandra
chose
;
I
only
know
her
*NL*
father
put
us
both
off
with
the
tender
age
of
his
daughter
and
vague
*NL*
words
that
neither
bound
him
nor
dismissed
us
.
My
rival
is
called
Anselmo
*NL*
and
I
myself
Eugenio
--
that
you
may
know
the
names
of
the
personages
that
*NL*
figure
in
this
tragedy
,
the
end
of
which
is
still
in
suspense
,
though
it
*NL*
is
plain
to
see
it
must
be
disastrous
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
there
arrived
in
our
town
one
Vicente
de
la
Roca
,
the
son
*NL*
of
a
poor
peasant
of
the
same
town
,
the
said
Vicente
having
returned
from
*NL*
service
as
a
soldier
in
Italy
and
divers
other
parts
.
A
captain
who
*NL*
chanced
to
pass
that
way
with
his
company
had
carried
him
off
from
our
*NL*
village
when
he
was
a
boy
of
about
twelve
years
,
and
now
twelve
years
*NL*
later
the
young
man
came
back
in
a
soldier
's
uniform
,
arrayed
in
a
*NL*
thousand
colours
,
and
all
over
glass
trinkets
and
fine
steel
chains
.
*NL*
To-day
he
would
appear
in
one
gay
dress
,
to-morrow
in
another
;
but
all
*NL*
flimsy
and
gaudy
,
of
little
substance
and
less
worth
.
The
peasant
folk
,
*NL*
who
are
naturally
malicious
,
and
when
they
have
nothing
to
do
can
be
*NL*
malice
itself
,
remarked
all
this
,
and
took
note
of
his
finery
and
*NL*
jewellery
,
piece
by
piece
,
and
discovered
that
he
had
three
suits
of
*NL*
different
colours
,
with
garters
and
stockings
to
match
;
but
he
made
so
*NL*
many
arrangements
and
combinations
out
of
them
,
that
if
they
had
not
*NL*
counted
them
,
anyone
would
have
sworn
that
he
had
made
a
display
of
more
*NL*
than
ten
suits
of
clothes
and
twenty
plumes
.
Do
not
look
upon
all
this
*NL*
that
I
am
telling
you
about
the
clothes
as
uncalled
for
or
spun
out
,
for
*NL*
they
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
story
.
He
used
to
seat
himself
on
a
*NL*
bench
under
the
great
poplar
in
our
plaza
,
and
there
he
would
keep
us
all
*NL*
hanging
open-mouthed
on
the
stories
he
told
us
of
his
exploits
.
There
was
*NL*
no
country
on
the
face
of
the
globe
he
had
not
seen
,
nor
battle
he
had
*NL*
not
been
engaged
in
;
he
had
killed
more
Moors
than
there
are
in
Morocco
*NL*
and
Tunis
,
and
fought
more
single
combats
,
according
to
his
own
account
,
*NL*
than
Garcilaso
,
Diego
Garcia
de
Paredes
and
a
thousand
others
he
named
,
*NL*
and
out
of
all
he
had
come
victorious
without
losing
a
drop
of
blood
.
On
*NL*
the
other
hand
he
showed
marks
of
wounds
,
which
,
though
they
could
not
be
*NL*
made
out
,
he
said
were
gunshot
wounds
received
in
divers
encounters
and
*NL*
actions
.
Lastly
,
with
monstrous
impudence
he
used
to
say
``
you
''
to
his
*NL*
equals
and
even
those
who
knew
what
he
was
,
and
declare
that
his
arm
was
*NL*
his
father
and
his
deeds
his
pedigree
,
and
that
being
a
soldier
he
was
as
*NL*
good
as
the
king
himself
.
And
to
add
to
these
swaggering
ways
he
was
a
*NL*
trifle
of
a
musician
,
and
played
the
guitar
with
such
a
flourish
that
*NL*
some
said
he
made
it
speak
;
nor
did
his
accomplishments
end
here
,
for
he
*NL*
was
something
of
a
poet
too
,
and
on
every
trifle
that
happened
in
the
*NL*
town
he
made
a
ballad
a
league
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
soldier
,
then
,
that
I
have
described
,
this
Vicente
de
la
Roca
,
this
*NL*
bravo
,
gallant
,
musician
,
poet
,
was
often
seen
and
watched
by
Leandra
*NL*
from
a
window
of
her
house
which
looked
out
on
the
plaza
.
The
glitter
of
*NL*
his
showy
attire
took
her
fancy
,
his
ballads
bewitched
her
-LRB-
for
he
gave
*NL*
away
twenty
copies
of
every
one
he
made
-RRB-
,
the
tales
of
his
exploits
which
*NL*
he
told
about
himself
came
to
her
ears
;
and
in
short
,
as
the
devil
no
*NL*
doubt
had
arranged
it
,
she
fell
in
love
with
him
before
the
presumption
*NL*
of
making
love
to
her
had
suggested
itself
to
him
;
and
as
in
love-affairs
*NL*
none
are
more
easily
brought
to
an
issue
than
those
which
have
the
*NL*
inclination
of
the
lady
for
an
ally
,
Leandra
and
Vicente
came
to
an
*NL*
understanding
without
any
difficulty
;
and
before
any
of
her
numerous
*NL*
suitors
had
any
suspicion
of
her
design
,
she
had
already
carried
it
into
*NL*
effect
,
having
left
the
house
of
her
dearly
beloved
father
-LRB-
for
mother
*NL*
she
had
none
-RRB-
,
and
disappeared
from
the
village
with
the
soldier
,
who
*NL*
came
more
triumphantly
out
of
this
enterprise
than
out
of
any
of
the
*NL*
large
number
he
laid
claim
to
.
All
the
village
and
all
who
heard
of
it
*NL*
were
amazed
at
the
affair
;
I
was
aghast
,
Anselmo
thunderstruck
,
her
*NL*
father
full
of
grief
,
her
relations
indignant
,
the
authorities
all
in
a
*NL*
ferment
,
the
officers
of
the
Brotherhood
in
arms
.
They
scoured
the
roads
,
*NL*
they
searched
the
woods
and
all
quarters
,
and
at
the
end
of
three
days
*NL*
they
found
the
flighty
Leandra
in
a
mountain
cave
,
stript
to
her
shift
,
*NL*
and
robbed
of
all
the
money
and
precious
jewels
she
had
carried
away
from
*NL*
home
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
brought
her
back
to
her
unhappy
father
,
and
questioned
her
as
to
her
*NL*
misfortune
,
and
she
confessed
without
pressure
that
Vicente
de
la
Roca
*NL*
had
deceived
her
,
and
under
promise
of
marrying
her
had
induced
her
to
*NL*
leave
her
father
's
house
,
as
he
meant
to
take
her
to
the
richest
and
most
*NL*
delightful
city
in
the
whole
world
,
which
was
Naples
;
and
that
she
,
*NL*
ill-advised
and
deluded
,
had
believed
him
,
and
robbed
her
father
,
and
*NL*
handed
over
all
to
him
the
night
she
disappeared
;
and
that
he
had
carried
*NL*
her
away
to
a
rugged
mountain
and
shut
her
up
in
the
eave
where
they
had
*NL*
found
her
.
She
said
,
moreover
,
that
the
soldier
,
without
robbing
her
of
*NL*
her
honour
,
had
taken
from
her
everything
she
had
,
and
made
off
,
leaving
*NL*
her
in
the
cave
,
a
thing
that
still
further
surprised
everybody
.
It
was
*NL*
not
easy
for
us
to
credit
the
young
man
's
continence
,
but
she
asserted
it
*NL*
with
such
earnestness
that
it
helped
to
console
her
distressed
father
,
*NL*
who
thought
nothing
of
what
had
been
taken
since
the
jewel
that
once
lost
*NL*
can
never
be
recovered
had
been
left
to
his
daughter
.
The
same
day
that
*NL*
Leandra
made
her
appearance
her
father
removed
her
from
our
sight
and
*NL*
took
her
away
to
shut
her
up
in
a
convent
in
a
town
near
this
,
in
the
*NL*
hope
that
time
may
wear
away
some
of
the
disgrace
she
has
incurred
.
*NL*
Leandra
's
youth
furnished
an
excuse
for
her
fault
,
at
least
with
those
to
*NL*
whom
it
was
of
no
consequence
whether
she
was
good
or
bad
;
but
those
who
*NL*
knew
her
shrewdness
and
intelligence
did
not
attribute
her
misdemeanour
*NL*
to
ignorance
but
to
wantonness
and
the
natural
disposition
of
women
,
*NL*
which
is
for
the
most
part
flighty
and
ill-regulated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leandra
withdrawn
from
sight
,
Anselmo
's
eyes
grew
blind
,
or
at
any
rate
*NL*
found
nothing
to
look
at
that
gave
them
any
pleasure
,
and
mine
were
in
*NL*
darkness
without
a
ray
of
light
to
direct
them
to
anything
enjoyable
*NL*
while
Leandra
was
away
.
Our
melancholy
grew
greater
,
our
patience
grew
*NL*
less
;
we
cursed
the
soldier
's
finery
and
railed
at
the
carelessness
of
*NL*
Leandra
's
father
.
At
last
Anselmo
and
I
agreed
to
leave
the
village
and
*NL*
come
to
this
valley
;
and
,
he
feeding
a
great
flock
of
sheep
of
his
own
,
*NL*
and
I
a
large
herd
of
goats
of
mine
,
we
pass
our
life
among
the
trees
,
*NL*
giving
vent
to
our
sorrows
,
together
singing
the
fair
Leandra
's
praises
,
*NL*
or
upbraiding
her
,
or
else
sighing
alone
,
and
to
heaven
pouring
forth
our
*NL*
complaints
in
solitude
.
Following
our
example
,
many
more
of
Leandra
's
*NL*
lovers
have
come
to
these
rude
mountains
and
adopted
our
mode
of
life
,
*NL*
and
they
are
so
numerous
that
one
would
fancy
the
place
had
been
turned
*NL*
into
the
pastoral
Arcadia
,
so
full
is
it
of
shepherds
and
sheep-folds
;
*NL*
nor
is
there
a
spot
in
it
where
the
name
of
the
fair
Leandra
is
not
*NL*
heard
.
Here
one
curses
her
and
calls
her
capricious
,
fickle
,
and
*NL*
immodest
,
there
another
condemns
her
as
frail
and
frivolous
;
this
pardons
*NL*
and
absolves
her
,
that
spurns
and
reviles
her
;
one
extols
her
beauty
,
*NL*
another
assails
her
character
,
and
in
short
all
abuse
her
,
and
all
adore
*NL*
her
,
and
to
such
a
pitch
has
this
general
infatuation
gone
that
there
are
*NL*
some
who
complain
of
her
scorn
without
ever
having
exchanged
a
word
with
*NL*
her
,
and
even
some
that
bewail
and
mourn
the
raging
fever
of
jealousy
,
*NL*
for
which
she
never
gave
anyone
cause
,
for
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
her
*NL*
misconduct
was
known
before
her
passion
.
There
is
no
nook
among
the
*NL*
rocks
,
no
brookside
,
no
shade
beneath
the
trees
that
is
not
haunted
by
*NL*
some
shepherd
telling
his
woes
to
the
breezes
;
wherever
there
is
an
echo
*NL*
it
repeats
the
name
of
Leandra
;
the
mountains
ring
with
``
Leandra
,
''
*NL*
``
Leandra
''
murmur
the
brooks
,
and
Leandra
keeps
us
all
bewildered
and
*NL*
bewitched
,
hoping
without
hope
and
fearing
without
knowing
what
we
fear
.
*NL*
Of
all
this
silly
set
the
one
that
shows
the
least
and
also
the
most
*NL*
sense
is
my
rival
Anselmo
,
for
having
so
many
other
things
to
complain
*NL*
of
,
he
only
complains
of
separation
,
and
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
*NL*
rebeck
,
which
he
plays
admirably
,
he
sings
his
complaints
in
verses
that
*NL*
show
his
ingenuity
.
I
follow
another
,
easier
,
and
to
my
mind
wiser
*NL*
course
,
and
that
is
to
rail
at
the
frivolity
of
women
,
at
their
*NL*
inconstancy
,
their
double
dealing
,
their
broken
promises
,
their
unkept
*NL*
pledges
,
and
in
short
the
want
of
reflection
they
show
in
fixing
their
*NL*
affections
and
inclinations
.
This
,
sirs
,
was
the
reason
of
words
and
*NL*
expressions
I
made
use
of
to
this
goat
when
I
came
up
just
now
;
for
as
*NL*
she
is
a
female
I
have
a
contempt
for
her
,
though
she
is
the
best
in
all
*NL*
my
fold
.
This
is
the
story
I
promised
to
tell
you
,
and
if
I
have
been
*NL*
tedious
in
telling
it
,
I
will
not
be
slow
to
serve
you
;
my
hut
is
close
*NL*
by
,
and
I
have
fresh
milk
and
dainty
cheese
there
,
as
well
as
a
variety
*NL*
of
toothsome
fruit
,
no
less
pleasing
to
the
eye
than
to
the
palate
.

CHAPTER
LII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
QUARREL
THAT
DON
QUIXOTE
HAD
WITH
THE
GOATHERD
,
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
*NL*
RARE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
PENITENTS
,
WHICH
WITH
AN
EXPENDITURE
OF
SWEAT
HE
*NL*
BROUGHT
TO
A
HAPPY
CONCLUSION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
goatherd
's
tale
gave
great
satisfaction
to
all
the
hearers
,
and
the
*NL*
canon
especially
enjoyed
it
,
for
he
had
remarked
with
particular
*NL*
attention
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
told
,
which
was
as
unlike
the
*NL*
manner
of
a
clownish
goatherd
as
it
was
like
that
of
a
polished
city
wit
;
*NL*
and
he
observed
that
the
curate
had
been
quite
right
in
saying
that
the
*NL*
woods
bred
men
of
learning
.
They
all
offered
their
services
to
Eugenio
*NL*
but
he
who
showed
himself
most
liberal
in
this
way
was
Don
Quixote
,
who
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
Most
assuredly
,
brother
goatherd
,
if
I
found
myself
in
a
*NL*
position
to
attempt
any
adventure
,
I
would
,
this
very
instant
,
set
out
on
*NL*
your
behalf
,
and
would
rescue
Leandra
from
that
convent
-LRB-
where
no
doubt
*NL*
she
is
kept
against
her
will
-RRB-
,
in
spite
of
the
abbess
and
all
who
might
*NL*
try
to
prevent
me
,
and
would
place
her
in
your
hands
to
deal
with
her
*NL*
according
to
your
will
and
pleasure
,
observing
,
however
,
the
laws
of
*NL*
chivalry
which
lay
down
that
no
violence
of
any
kind
is
to
be
offered
to
*NL*
any
damsel
.
But
I
trust
in
God
our
Lord
that
the
might
of
one
malignant
*NL*
enchanter
may
not
prove
so
great
but
that
the
power
of
another
better
*NL*
disposed
may
prove
superior
to
it
,
and
then
I
promise
you
my
support
and
*NL*
assistance
,
as
I
am
bound
to
do
by
my
profession
,
which
is
none
other
*NL*
than
to
give
aid
to
the
weak
and
needy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goatherd
eyed
him
,
and
noticing
Don
Quixote
's
sorry
appearance
and
*NL*
looks
,
he
was
filled
with
wonder
,
and
asked
the
barber
,
who
was
next
him
,
*NL*
``
Senor
,
who
is
this
man
who
makes
such
a
figure
and
talks
in
such
a
*NL*
strain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
should
it
be
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
but
the
famous
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
the
undoer
of
injustice
,
the
righter
of
wrongs
,
the
protector
of
*NL*
damsels
,
the
terror
of
giants
,
and
the
winner
of
battles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
the
goatherd
,
``
sounds
like
what
one
reads
in
the
books
of
*NL*
the
knights-errant
,
who
did
all
that
you
say
this
man
does
;
though
it
is
*NL*
my
belief
that
either
you
are
joking
,
or
else
this
gentleman
has
empty
*NL*
lodgings
in
his
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
great
scoundrel
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
it
is
you
who
are
*NL*
empty
and
a
fool
.
I
am
fuller
than
ever
was
the
whoreson
bitch
that
bore
*NL*
you
;
''
and
passing
from
words
to
deeds
,
he
caught
up
a
loaf
that
was
near
*NL*
him
and
sent
it
full
in
the
goatherd
's
face
,
with
such
force
that
he
*NL*
flattened
his
nose
;
but
the
goatherd
,
who
did
not
understand
jokes
,
and
*NL*
found
himself
roughly
handled
in
such
good
earnest
,
paying
no
respect
to
*NL*
carpet
,
tablecloth
,
or
diners
,
sprang
upon
Don
Quixote
,
and
seizing
him
*NL*
by
the
throat
with
both
hands
would
no
doubt
have
throttled
him
,
had
not
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
that
instant
come
to
the
rescue
,
and
grasping
him
by
the
*NL*
shoulders
flung
him
down
on
the
table
,
smashing
plates
,
breaking
glasses
,
*NL*
and
upsetting
and
scattering
everything
on
it
.
Don
Quixote
,
finding
*NL*
himself
free
,
strove
to
get
on
top
of
the
goatherd
,
who
,
with
his
face
*NL*
covered
with
blood
,
and
soundly
kicked
by
Sancho
,
was
on
all
fours
*NL*
feeling
about
for
one
of
the
table-knives
to
take
a
bloody
revenge
with
.
*NL*
The
canon
and
the
curate
,
however
,
prevented
him
,
but
the
barber
so
*NL*
contrived
it
that
he
got
Don
Quixote
under
him
,
and
rained
down
upon
him
*NL*
such
a
shower
of
fisticuffs
that
the
poor
knight
's
face
streamed
with
*NL*
blood
as
freely
as
his
own
.
The
canon
and
the
curate
were
bursting
with
*NL*
laughter
,
the
officers
were
capering
with
delight
,
and
both
the
one
and
*NL*
the
other
hissed
them
on
as
they
do
dogs
that
are
worrying
one
another
in
*NL*
a
fight
.
Sancho
alone
was
frantic
,
for
he
could
not
free
himself
from
the
*NL*
grasp
of
one
of
the
canon
's
servants
,
who
kept
him
from
going
to
his
*NL*
master
's
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
while
they
were
all
,
with
the
exception
of
the
two
bruisers
who
*NL*
were
mauling
each
other
,
in
high
glee
and
enjoyment
,
they
heard
a
trumpet
*NL*
sound
a
note
so
doleful
that
it
made
them
all
look
in
the
direction
*NL*
whence
the
sound
seemed
to
come
.
But
the
one
that
was
most
excited
by
*NL*
hearing
it
was
Don
Quixote
,
who
though
sorely
against
his
will
he
was
*NL*
under
the
goatherd
,
and
something
more
than
pretty
well
pummelled
,
said
*NL*
to
him
,
``
Brother
devil
-LRB-
for
it
is
impossible
but
that
thou
must
be
one
*NL*
since
thou
hast
had
might
and
strength
enough
to
overcome
mine
-RRB-
,
I
ask
*NL*
thee
to
agree
to
a
truce
for
but
one
hour
for
the
solemn
note
of
yonder
*NL*
trumpet
that
falls
on
our
ears
seems
to
me
to
summon
me
to
some
new
*NL*
adventure
.
''
The
goatherd
,
who
was
by
this
time
tired
of
pummelling
and
*NL*
being
pummelled
,
released
him
at
once
,
and
Don
Quixote
rising
to
his
feet
*NL*
and
turning
his
eyes
to
the
quarter
where
the
sound
had
been
heard
,
*NL*
suddenly
saw
coming
down
the
slope
of
a
hill
several
men
clad
in
white
*NL*
like
penitents
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
that
the
clouds
had
that
year
withheld
their
moisture
from
*NL*
the
earth
,
and
in
all
the
villages
of
the
district
they
were
organising
*NL*
processions
,
rogations
,
and
penances
,
imploring
God
to
open
the
hands
of
*NL*
his
mercy
and
send
the
rain
;
and
to
this
end
the
people
of
a
village
that
*NL*
was
hard
by
were
going
in
procession
to
a
holy
hermitage
there
was
on
one
*NL*
side
of
that
valley
.
Don
Quixote
when
he
saw
the
strange
garb
of
the
*NL*
penitents
,
without
reflecting
how
often
he
had
seen
it
before
,
took
it
*NL*
into
his
head
that
this
was
a
case
of
adventure
,
and
that
it
fell
to
him
*NL*
alone
as
a
knight-errant
to
engage
in
it
;
and
he
was
all
the
more
*NL*
confirmed
in
this
notion
,
by
the
idea
that
an
image
draped
in
black
they
*NL*
had
with
them
was
some
illustrious
lady
that
these
villains
and
*NL*
discourteous
thieves
were
carrying
off
by
force
.
As
soon
as
this
occurred
*NL*
to
him
he
ran
with
all
speed
to
Rocinante
who
was
grazing
at
large
,
and
*NL*
taking
the
bridle
and
the
buckler
from
the
saddle-bow
,
he
had
him
bridled
*NL*
in
an
instant
,
and
calling
to
Sancho
for
his
sword
he
mounted
Rocinante
,
*NL*
braced
his
buckler
on
his
arm
,
and
in
a
loud
voice
exclaimed
to
those
who
*NL*
stood
by
,
``
Now
,
noble
company
,
ye
shall
see
how
important
it
is
that
*NL*
there
should
be
knights
in
the
world
professing
the
order
of
knight-errantry
;
*NL*
now
,
I
say
,
ye
shall
see
,
by
the
deliverance
of
that
worthy
lady
who
is
*NL*
borne
captive
there
,
whether
knights-errant
deserve
to
be
held
in
*NL*
estimation
,
''
and
so
saying
he
brought
his
legs
to
bear
on
Rocinante
--
for
*NL*
he
had
no
spurs
--
and
at
a
full
canter
-LRB-
for
in
all
this
veracious
history
*NL*
we
never
read
of
Rocinante
fairly
galloping
-RRB-
set
off
to
encounter
the
*NL*
penitents
,
though
the
curate
,
the
canon
,
and
the
barber
ran
to
prevent
*NL*
him
.
But
it
was
out
of
their
power
,
nor
did
he
even
stop
for
the
shouts
*NL*
of
Sancho
calling
after
him
,
``
Where
are
you
going
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
?
*NL*
What
devils
have
possessed
you
to
set
you
on
against
our
Catholic
faith
?
*NL*
Plague
take
me
!
mind
,
that
is
a
procession
of
penitents
,
and
the
lady
*NL*
they
are
carrying
on
that
stand
there
is
the
blessed
image
of
the
*NL*
immaculate
Virgin
.
Take
care
what
you
are
doing
,
senor
,
for
this
time
it
*NL*
may
be
safely
said
you
do
n't
know
what
you
are
about
.
''
Sancho
laboured
in
*NL*
vain
,
for
his
master
was
so
bent
on
coming
to
quarters
with
these
sheeted
*NL*
figures
and
releasing
the
lady
in
black
that
he
did
not
hear
a
word
;
and
*NL*
even
had
he
heard
,
he
would
not
have
turned
back
if
the
king
had
ordered
*NL*
him
.
He
came
up
with
the
procession
and
reined
in
Rocinante
,
who
was
*NL*
already
anxious
enough
to
slacken
speed
a
little
,
and
in
a
hoarse
,
*NL*
excited
voice
he
exclaimed
,
``
You
who
hide
your
faces
,
perhaps
because
you
*NL*
are
not
good
subjects
,
pay
attention
and
listen
to
what
I
am
about
to
say
*NL*
to
you
.
''
The
first
to
halt
were
those
who
were
carrying
the
image
,
and
*NL*
one
of
the
four
ecclesiastics
who
were
chanting
the
Litany
,
struck
by
the
*NL*
strange
figure
of
Don
Quixote
,
the
leanness
of
Rocinante
,
and
the
other
*NL*
ludicrous
peculiarities
he
observed
,
said
in
reply
to
him
,
``
Brother
,
if
*NL*
you
have
anything
to
say
to
us
say
it
quickly
,
for
these
brethren
are
*NL*
whipping
themselves
,
and
we
can
not
stop
,
nor
is
it
reasonable
we
should
*NL*
stop
to
hear
anything
,
unless
indeed
it
is
short
enough
to
be
said
in
two
*NL*
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
say
it
in
one
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
it
is
this
;
that
at
*NL*
once
,
this
very
instant
,
ye
release
that
fair
lady
whose
tears
and
sad
*NL*
aspect
show
plainly
that
ye
are
carrying
her
off
against
her
will
,
and
*NL*
that
ye
have
committed
some
scandalous
outrage
against
her
;
and
I
,
who
*NL*
was
born
into
the
world
to
redress
all
such
like
wrongs
,
will
not
permit
*NL*
you
to
advance
another
step
until
you
have
restored
to
her
the
liberty
*NL*
she
pines
for
and
deserves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
these
words
all
the
hearers
concluded
that
he
must
be
a
madman
,
and
*NL*
began
to
laugh
heartily
,
and
their
laughter
acted
like
gunpowder
on
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
fury
,
for
drawing
his
sword
without
another
word
he
made
a
rush
*NL*
at
the
stand
.
One
of
those
who
supported
it
,
leaving
the
burden
to
his
*NL*
comrades
,
advanced
to
meet
him
,
flourishing
a
forked
stick
that
he
had
*NL*
for
propping
up
the
stand
when
resting
,
and
with
this
he
caught
a
mighty
*NL*
cut
Don
Quixote
made
at
him
that
severed
it
in
two
;
but
with
the
portion
*NL*
that
remained
in
his
hand
he
dealt
such
a
thwack
on
the
shoulder
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
sword
arm
-LRB-
which
the
buckler
could
not
protect
against
the
*NL*
clownish
assault
-RRB-
that
poor
Don
Quixote
came
to
the
ground
in
a
sad
*NL*
plight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
,
who
was
coming
on
close
behind
puffing
and
blowing
,
seeing
*NL*
him
fall
,
cried
out
to
his
assailant
not
to
strike
him
again
,
for
he
was
*NL*
a
poor
enchanted
knight
,
who
had
never
harmed
anyone
all
the
days
of
his
*NL*
life
;
but
what
checked
the
clown
was
,
not
Sancho
's
shouting
,
but
seeing
*NL*
that
Don
Quixote
did
not
stir
hand
or
foot
;
and
so
,
fancying
he
had
*NL*
killed
him
,
he
hastily
hitched
up
his
tunic
under
his
girdle
and
took
to
*NL*
his
heels
across
the
country
like
a
deer
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
all
Don
Quixote
's
companions
had
come
up
to
where
he
lay
;
*NL*
but
the
processionists
seeing
them
come
running
,
and
with
them
the
*NL*
officers
of
the
Brotherhood
with
their
crossbows
,
apprehended
mischief
,
*NL*
and
clustering
round
the
image
,
raised
their
hoods
,
and
grasped
their
*NL*
scourges
,
as
the
priests
did
their
tapers
,
and
awaited
the
attack
,
*NL*
resolved
to
defend
themselves
and
even
to
take
the
offensive
against
*NL*
their
assailants
if
they
could
.
Fortune
,
however
,
arranged
the
matter
*NL*
better
than
they
expected
,
for
all
Sancho
did
was
to
fling
himself
on
his
*NL*
master
's
body
,
raising
over
him
the
most
doleful
and
laughable
*NL*
lamentation
that
ever
was
heard
,
for
he
believed
he
was
dead
.
The
curate
*NL*
was
known
to
another
curate
who
walked
in
the
procession
,
and
their
*NL*
recognition
of
one
another
set
at
rest
the
apprehensions
of
both
parties
;
*NL*
the
first
then
told
the
other
in
two
words
who
Don
Quixote
was
,
and
he
*NL*
and
the
whole
troop
of
penitents
went
to
see
if
the
poor
gentleman
was
*NL*
dead
,
and
heard
Sancho
Panza
saying
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
``
Oh
flower
*NL*
of
chivalry
,
that
with
one
blow
of
a
stick
hast
ended
the
course
of
thy
*NL*
well-spent
life
!
Oh
pride
of
thy
race
,
honour
and
glory
of
all
La
Mancha
,
*NL*
nay
,
of
all
the
world
,
that
for
want
of
thee
will
be
full
of
evil-doers
,
*NL*
no
longer
in
fear
of
punishment
for
their
misdeeds
!
Oh
thou
,
generous
*NL*
above
all
the
Alexanders
,
since
for
only
eight
months
of
service
thou
*NL*
hast
given
me
the
best
island
the
sea
girds
or
surrounds
!
Humble
with
the
*NL*
proud
,
haughty
with
the
humble
,
encounterer
of
dangers
,
endurer
of
*NL*
outrages
,
enamoured
without
reason
,
imitator
of
the
good
,
scourge
of
the
*NL*
wicked
,
enemy
of
the
mean
,
in
short
,
knight-errant
,
which
is
all
that
can
*NL*
be
said
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
cries
and
moans
of
Sancho
,
Don
Quixote
came
to
himself
,
and
the
*NL*
first
word
he
said
was
,
``
He
who
lives
separated
from
you
,
sweetest
*NL*
Dulcinea
,
has
greater
miseries
to
endure
than
these
.
Aid
me
,
friend
*NL*
Sancho
,
to
mount
the
enchanted
cart
,
for
I
am
not
in
a
condition
to
press
*NL*
the
saddle
of
Rocinante
,
as
this
shoulder
is
all
knocked
to
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
do
with
all
my
heart
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
let
us
*NL*
return
to
our
village
with
these
gentlemen
,
who
seek
your
good
,
and
there
*NL*
we
will
prepare
for
making
another
sally
,
which
may
turn
out
more
*NL*
profitable
and
creditable
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
right
,
Sancho
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
;
``
It
will
be
wise
to
let
*NL*
the
malign
influence
of
the
stars
which
now
prevails
pass
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
canon
,
the
curate
,
and
the
barber
told
him
he
would
act
very
wisely
*NL*
in
doing
as
he
said
;
and
so
,
highly
amused
at
Sancho
Panza
's
*NL*
simplicities
,
they
placed
Don
Quixote
in
the
cart
as
before
.
The
*NL*
procession
once
more
formed
itself
in
order
and
proceeded
on
its
road
;
*NL*
the
goatherd
took
his
leave
of
the
party
;
the
officers
of
the
Brotherhood
*NL*
declined
to
go
any
farther
,
and
the
curate
paid
them
what
was
due
to
*NL*
them
;
the
canon
begged
the
curate
to
let
him
know
how
Don
Quixote
did
,
*NL*
whether
he
was
cured
of
his
madness
or
still
suffered
from
it
,
and
then
*NL*
begged
leave
to
continue
his
journey
;
in
short
,
they
all
separated
and
*NL*
went
their
ways
,
leaving
to
themselves
the
curate
and
the
barber
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
Sancho
Panza
,
and
the
good
Rocinante
,
who
regarded
everything
*NL*
with
as
great
resignation
as
his
master
.
The
carter
yoked
his
oxen
and
*NL*
made
Don
Quixote
comfortable
on
a
truss
of
hay
,
and
at
his
usual
*NL*
deliberate
pace
took
the
road
the
curate
directed
,
and
at
the
end
of
six
*NL*
days
they
reached
Don
Quixote
's
village
,
and
entered
it
about
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
day
,
which
it
so
happened
was
a
Sunday
,
and
the
people
were
all
in
*NL*
the
plaza
,
through
which
Don
Quixote
's
cart
passed
.
They
all
flocked
to
*NL*
see
what
was
in
the
cart
,
and
when
they
recognised
their
townsman
they
*NL*
were
filled
with
amazement
,
and
a
boy
ran
off
to
bring
the
news
to
his
*NL*
housekeeper
and
his
niece
that
their
master
and
uncle
had
come
back
all
*NL*
lean
and
yellow
and
stretched
on
a
truss
of
hay
on
an
ox-cart
.
It
was
*NL*
piteous
to
hear
the
cries
the
two
good
ladies
raised
,
how
they
beat
their
*NL*
breasts
and
poured
out
fresh
maledictions
on
those
accursed
books
of
*NL*
chivalry
;
all
which
was
renewed
when
they
saw
Don
Quixote
coming
in
at
*NL*
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
news
of
Don
Quixote
's
arrival
Sancho
Panza
's
wife
came
running
,
*NL*
for
she
by
this
time
knew
that
her
husband
had
gone
away
with
him
as
his
*NL*
squire
,
and
on
seeing
Sancho
,
the
first
thing
she
asked
him
was
if
the
*NL*
ass
was
well
.
Sancho
replied
that
he
was
,
better
than
his
master
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
be
to
God
,
''
said
she
,
``
for
being
so
good
to
me
;
but
now
tell
me
,
*NL*
my
friend
,
what
have
you
made
by
your
squirings
?
What
gown
have
you
*NL*
brought
me
back
?
What
shoes
for
your
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bring
nothing
of
that
sort
,
wife
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
though
I
bring
other
*NL*
things
of
more
consequence
and
value
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
of
that
,
''
returned
his
wife
;
``
show
me
these
things
of
*NL*
more
value
and
consequence
,
my
friend
;
for
I
want
to
see
them
to
cheer
my
*NL*
heart
that
has
been
so
sad
and
heavy
all
these
ages
that
you
have
been
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
show
them
to
you
at
home
,
wife
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
be
content
for
the
*NL*
present
;
for
if
it
please
God
that
we
should
again
go
on
our
travels
in
*NL*
search
of
adventures
,
you
will
soon
see
me
a
count
,
or
governor
of
an
*NL*
island
,
and
that
not
one
of
those
everyday
ones
,
but
the
best
that
is
to
*NL*
be
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
grant
it
,
husband
,
''
said
she
,
``
for
indeed
we
have
need
of
it
.
But
*NL*
tell
me
,
what
's
this
about
islands
,
for
I
do
n't
understand
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honey
is
not
for
the
mouth
of
the
ass
,
''
returned
Sancho
;
``
all
in
good
*NL*
time
thou
shalt
see
,
wife
--
nay
,
thou
wilt
be
surprised
to
hear
thyself
*NL*
called
`
your
ladyship
'
by
all
thy
vassals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
talking
about
,
Sancho
,
with
your
ladyships
,
islands
,
and
*NL*
vassals
?
''
returned
Teresa
Panza
--
for
so
Sancho
's
wife
was
called
,
though
*NL*
they
were
not
relations
,
for
in
La
Mancha
it
is
customary
for
wives
to
*NL*
take
their
husbands
'
surnames
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
know
all
this
,
Teresa
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
it
is
*NL*
enough
that
I
am
telling
you
the
truth
,
so
shut
your
mouth
.
But
I
may
*NL*
tell
you
this
much
by
the
way
,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
more
*NL*
delightful
than
to
be
a
person
of
consideration
,
squire
to
a
*NL*
knight-errant
,
and
a
seeker
of
adventures
.
To
be
sure
most
of
those
one
*NL*
finds
do
not
end
as
pleasantly
as
one
could
wish
,
for
out
of
a
hundred
,
*NL*
ninety-nine
will
turn
out
cross
and
contrary
.
I
know
it
by
experience
,
*NL*
for
out
of
some
I
came
blanketed
,
and
out
of
others
belaboured
.
Still
,
*NL*
for
all
that
,
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
on
the
look-out
for
what
may
*NL*
happen
,
crossing
mountains
,
searching
woods
,
climbing
rocks
,
visiting
*NL*
castles
,
putting
up
at
inns
,
all
at
free
quarters
,
and
devil
take
the
*NL*
maravedi
to
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
conversation
passed
between
Sancho
Panza
and
his
wife
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
housekeeper
and
niece
took
him
in
and
undressed
him
and
laid
*NL*
him
in
his
old
bed
.
He
eyed
them
askance
,
and
could
not
make
out
where
he
*NL*
was
.
The
curate
charged
his
niece
to
be
very
careful
to
make
her
uncle
*NL*
comfortable
and
to
keep
a
watch
over
him
lest
he
should
make
his
escape
*NL*
from
them
again
,
telling
her
what
they
had
been
obliged
to
do
to
bring
*NL*
him
home
.
On
this
the
pair
once
more
lifted
up
their
voices
and
renewed
*NL*
their
maledictions
upon
the
books
of
chivalry
,
and
implored
heaven
to
*NL*
plunge
the
authors
of
such
lies
and
nonsense
into
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
bottomless
pit
.
They
were
,
in
short
,
kept
in
anxiety
and
dread
lest
their
*NL*
uncle
and
master
should
give
them
the
slip
the
moment
he
found
himself
*NL*
somewhat
better
,
and
as
they
feared
so
it
fell
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
author
of
this
history
,
though
he
has
devoted
research
and
*NL*
industry
to
the
discovery
of
the
deeds
achieved
by
Don
Quixote
in
his
*NL*
third
sally
,
has
been
unable
to
obtain
any
information
respecting
them
,
*NL*
at
any
rate
derived
from
authentic
documents
;
tradition
has
merely
*NL*
preserved
in
the
memory
of
La
Mancha
the
fact
that
Don
Quixote
,
the
third
*NL*
time
he
sallied
forth
from
his
home
,
betook
himself
to
Saragossa
,
where
*NL*
he
was
present
at
some
famous
jousts
which
came
off
in
that
city
,
and
*NL*
that
he
had
adventures
there
worthy
of
his
valour
and
high
intelligence
.
*NL*
Of
his
end
and
death
he
could
learn
no
particulars
,
nor
would
he
have
*NL*
ascertained
it
or
known
of
it
,
if
good
fortune
had
not
produced
an
old
*NL*
physician
for
him
who
had
in
his
possession
a
leaden
box
,
which
,
*NL*
according
to
his
account
,
had
been
discovered
among
the
crumbling
*NL*
foundations
of
an
ancient
hermitage
that
was
being
rebuilt
;
in
which
box
*NL*
were
found
certain
parchment
manuscripts
in
Gothic
character
,
but
in
*NL*
Castilian
verse
,
containing
many
of
his
achievements
,
and
setting
forth
*NL*
the
beauty
of
Dulcinea
,
the
form
of
Rocinante
,
the
fidelity
of
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
,
and
the
burial
of
Don
Quixote
himself
,
together
with
sundry
*NL*
epitaphs
and
eulogies
on
his
life
and
character
;
but
all
that
could
be
*NL*
read
and
deciphered
were
those
which
the
trustworthy
author
of
this
new
*NL*
and
unparalleled
history
here
presents
.
And
the
said
author
asks
of
those
*NL*
that
shall
read
it
nothing
in
return
for
the
vast
toil
which
it
has
cost
*NL*
him
in
examining
and
searching
the
Manchegan
archives
in
order
to
bring
*NL*
it
to
light
,
save
that
they
give
him
the
same
credit
that
people
of
sense
*NL*
give
to
the
books
of
chivalry
that
pervade
the
world
and
are
so
popular
;
*NL*
for
with
this
he
will
consider
himself
amply
paid
and
fully
satisfied
,
*NL*
and
will
be
encouraged
to
seek
out
and
produce
other
histories
,
if
not
as
*NL*
truthful
,
at
least
equal
in
invention
and
not
less
entertaining
.
The
*NL*
first
words
written
on
the
parchment
found
in
the
leaden
box
were
these

DEDICATION
OF
PART
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
TO
THE
COUNT
OF
LEMOS
:
*NL*
*NL*
These
days
past
,
when
sending
Your
Excellency
my
plays
,
that
had
appeared
*NL*
in
print
before
being
shown
on
the
stage
,
I
said
,
if
I
remember
well
,
*NL*
that
Don
Quixote
was
putting
on
his
spurs
to
go
and
render
homage
to
Your
*NL*
Excellency
.
Now
I
say
that
``
with
his
spurs
,
he
is
on
his
way
.
''
Should
he
*NL*
reach
destination
methinks
I
shall
have
rendered
some
service
to
Your
*NL*
Excellency
,
as
from
many
parts
I
am
urged
to
send
him
off
,
so
as
to
*NL*
dispel
the
loathing
and
disgust
caused
by
another
Don
Quixote
who
,
under
*NL*
the
name
of
Second
Part
,
has
run
masquerading
through
the
whole
world
.
*NL*
And
he
who
has
shown
the
greatest
longing
for
him
has
been
the
great
*NL*
Emperor
of
China
,
who
wrote
me
a
letter
in
Chinese
a
month
ago
and
sent
*NL*
it
by
a
special
courier
.
He
asked
me
,
or
to
be
truthful
,
he
begged
me
to
*NL*
send
him
Don
Quixote
,
for
he
intended
to
found
a
college
where
the
*NL*
Spanish
tongue
would
be
taught
,
and
it
was
his
wish
that
the
book
to
be
*NL*
read
should
be
the
History
of
Don
Quixote
.
He
also
added
that
I
should
go
*NL*
and
be
the
rector
of
this
college
.
I
asked
the
bearer
if
His
Majesty
had
*NL*
afforded
a
sum
in
aid
of
my
travel
expenses
.
He
answered
,
``
No
,
not
even
*NL*
in
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
brother
,
''
I
replied
,
``
you
can
return
to
your
China
,
post
haste
or
*NL*
at
whatever
haste
you
are
bound
to
go
,
as
I
am
not
fit
for
so
long
a
*NL*
travel
and
,
besides
being
ill
,
I
am
very
much
without
money
,
while
*NL*
Emperor
for
Emperor
and
Monarch
for
Monarch
,
I
have
at
Naples
the
great
*NL*
Count
of
Lemos
,
who
,
without
so
many
petty
titles
of
colleges
and
*NL*
rectorships
,
sustains
me
,
protects
me
and
does
me
more
favour
than
I
can
*NL*
wish
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
gave
him
his
leave
and
I
beg
mine
from
you
,
offering
Your
*NL*
Excellency
the
``
Trabajos
de
Persiles
y
Sigismunda
,
''
a
book
I
shall
finish
*NL*
within
four
months
,
Deo
volente
,
and
which
will
be
either
the
worst
or
*NL*
the
best
that
has
been
composed
in
our
language
,
I
mean
of
those
intended
*NL*
for
entertainment
;
at
which
I
repent
of
having
called
it
the
worst
,
for
,
*NL*
in
the
opinion
of
friends
,
it
is
bound
to
attain
the
summit
of
possible
*NL*
quality
.
May
Your
Excellency
return
in
such
health
that
is
wished
you
;
*NL*
Persiles
will
be
ready
to
kiss
your
hand
and
I
your
feet
,
being
as
I
am
,
*NL*
Your
Excellency

most
humble
servant

THE
AUTHOR
'S
PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
God
bless
me
,
gentle
-LRB-
or
it
may
be
plebeian
-RRB-
reader
,
how
eagerly
must
*NL*
thou
be
looking
forward
to
this
preface
,
expecting
to
find
there
*NL*
retaliation
,
scolding
,
and
abuse
against
the
author
of
the
second
Don
*NL*
Quixote
--
I
mean
him
who
was
,
they
say
,
begotten
at
Tordesillas
and
born
*NL*
at
Tarragona
!
Well
then
,
the
truth
is
,
I
am
not
going
to
give
thee
that
*NL*
satisfaction
;
for
,
though
injuries
stir
up
anger
in
humbler
breasts
,
in
*NL*
mine
the
rule
must
admit
of
an
exception
.
Thou
wouldst
have
me
call
him
*NL*
ass
,
fool
,
and
malapert
,
but
I
have
no
such
intention
;
let
his
offence
be
*NL*
his
punishment
,
with
his
bread
let
him
eat
it
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
*NL*
What
I
can
not
help
taking
amiss
is
that
he
charges
me
with
being
old
and
*NL*
one-handed
,
as
if
it
had
been
in
my
power
to
keep
time
from
passing
over
*NL*
me
,
or
as
if
the
loss
of
my
hand
had
been
brought
about
in
some
tavern
,
*NL*
and
not
on
the
grandest
occasion
the
past
or
present
has
seen
,
or
the
*NL*
future
can
hope
to
see
.
If
my
wounds
have
no
beauty
to
the
beholder
's
*NL*
eye
,
they
are
,
at
least
,
honourable
in
the
estimation
of
those
who
know
*NL*
where
they
were
received
;
for
the
soldier
shows
to
greater
advantage
dead
*NL*
in
battle
than
alive
in
flight
;
and
so
strongly
is
this
my
feeling
,
that
*NL*
if
now
it
were
proposed
to
perform
an
impossibility
for
me
,
I
would
*NL*
rather
have
had
my
share
in
that
mighty
action
,
than
be
free
from
my
*NL*
wounds
this
minute
without
having
been
present
at
it
.
Those
the
soldier
*NL*
shows
on
his
face
and
breast
are
stars
that
direct
others
to
the
heaven
*NL*
of
honour
and
ambition
of
merited
praise
;
and
moreover
it
is
to
be
*NL*
observed
that
it
is
not
with
grey
hairs
that
one
writes
,
but
with
the
*NL*
understanding
,
and
that
commonly
improves
with
years
.
I
take
it
amiss
,
*NL*
too
,
that
he
calls
me
envious
,
and
explains
to
me
,
as
if
I
were
ignorant
,
*NL*
what
envy
is
;
for
really
and
truly
,
of
the
two
kinds
there
are
,
I
only
*NL*
know
that
which
is
holy
,
noble
,
and
high-minded
;
and
if
that
be
so
,
as
it
*NL*
is
,
I
am
not
likely
to
attack
a
priest
,
above
all
if
,
in
addition
,
he
*NL*
holds
the
rank
of
familiar
of
the
Holy
Office
.
And
if
he
said
what
he
did
*NL*
on
account
of
him
on
whose
behalf
it
seems
he
spoke
,
he
is
entirely
*NL*
mistaken
;
for
I
worship
the
genius
of
that
person
,
and
admire
his
works
*NL*
and
his
unceasing
and
strenuous
industry
.
After
all
,
I
am
grateful
to
*NL*
this
gentleman
,
the
author
,
for
saying
that
my
novels
are
more
satirical
*NL*
than
exemplary
,
but
that
they
are
good
;
for
they
could
not
be
that
unless
*NL*
there
was
a
little
of
everything
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suspect
thou
wilt
say
that
I
am
taking
a
very
humble
line
,
and
keeping
*NL*
myself
too
much
within
the
bounds
of
my
moderation
,
from
a
feeling
that
*NL*
additional
suffering
should
not
be
inflicted
upon
a
sufferer
,
and
that
*NL*
what
this
gentleman
has
to
endure
must
doubtless
be
very
great
,
as
he
*NL*
does
not
dare
to
come
out
into
the
open
field
and
broad
daylight
,
but
*NL*
hides
his
name
and
disguises
his
country
as
if
he
had
been
guilty
of
some
*NL*
lese
majesty
.
If
perchance
thou
shouldst
come
to
know
him
,
tell
him
from
*NL*
me
that
I
do
not
hold
myself
aggrieved
;
for
I
know
well
what
the
*NL*
temptations
of
the
devil
are
,
and
that
one
of
the
greatest
is
putting
it
*NL*
into
a
man
's
head
that
he
can
write
and
print
a
book
by
which
he
will
get
*NL*
as
much
fame
as
money
,
and
as
much
money
as
fame
;
and
to
prove
it
I
will
*NL*
beg
of
you
,
in
your
own
sprightly
,
pleasant
way
,
to
tell
him
this
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
madman
in
Seville
who
took
to
one
of
the
drollest
absurdities
*NL*
and
vagaries
that
ever
madman
in
the
world
gave
way
to
.
It
was
this
:
he
*NL*
made
a
tube
of
reed
sharp
at
one
end
,
and
catching
a
dog
in
the
street
,
*NL*
or
wherever
it
might
be
,
he
with
his
foot
held
one
of
its
legs
fast
,
and
*NL*
with
his
hand
lifted
up
the
other
,
and
as
best
he
could
fixed
the
tube
*NL*
where
,
by
blowing
,
he
made
the
dog
as
round
as
a
ball
;
then
holding
it
in
*NL*
this
position
,
he
gave
it
a
couple
of
slaps
on
the
belly
,
and
let
it
go
,
*NL*
saying
to
the
bystanders
-LRB-
and
there
were
always
plenty
of
them
-RRB-
:
``
Do
your
*NL*
worships
think
,
now
,
that
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
blow
up
a
dog
?
''
--
Does
*NL*
your
worship
think
now
,
that
it
is
an
easy
thing
to
write
a
book
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
this
story
does
not
suit
him
,
you
may
,
dear
reader
,
tell
him
this
*NL*
one
,
which
is
likewise
of
a
madman
and
a
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Cordova
there
was
another
madman
,
whose
way
it
was
to
carry
a
piece
of
*NL*
marble
slab
or
a
stone
,
not
of
the
lightest
,
on
his
head
,
and
when
he
*NL*
came
upon
any
unwary
dog
he
used
to
draw
close
to
him
and
let
the
weight
*NL*
fall
right
on
top
of
him
;
on
which
the
dog
in
a
rage
,
barking
and
*NL*
howling
,
would
run
three
streets
without
stopping
.
It
so
happened
,
*NL*
however
,
that
one
of
the
dogs
he
discharged
his
load
upon
was
a
*NL*
cap-maker
's
dog
,
of
which
his
master
was
very
fond
.
The
stone
came
down
*NL*
hitting
it
on
the
head
,
the
dog
raised
a
yell
at
the
blow
,
the
master
saw
*NL*
the
affair
and
was
wroth
,
and
snatching
up
a
measuring-yard
rushed
out
at
*NL*
the
madman
and
did
not
leave
a
sound
bone
in
his
body
,
and
at
every
*NL*
stroke
he
gave
him
he
said
,
``
You
dog
,
you
thief
!
my
lurcher
!
Do
n't
you
*NL*
see
,
you
brute
,
that
my
dog
is
a
lurcher
?
''
and
so
,
repeating
the
word
*NL*
``
lurcher
''
again
and
again
,
he
sent
the
madman
away
beaten
to
a
jelly
.
The
*NL*
madman
took
the
lesson
to
heart
,
and
vanished
,
and
for
more
than
a
month
*NL*
never
once
showed
himself
in
public
;
but
after
that
he
came
out
again
*NL*
with
his
old
trick
and
a
heavier
load
than
ever
.
He
came
up
to
where
*NL*
there
was
a
dog
,
and
examining
it
very
carefully
without
venturing
to
let
*NL*
the
stone
fall
,
he
said
:
``
This
is
a
lurcher
;
ware
!
''
In
short
,
all
the
*NL*
dogs
he
came
across
,
be
they
mastiffs
or
terriers
,
he
said
were
lurchers
;
*NL*
and
he
discharged
no
more
stones
.
Maybe
it
will
be
the
same
with
this
*NL*
historian
;
that
he
will
not
venture
another
time
to
discharge
the
weight
*NL*
of
his
wit
in
books
,
which
,
being
bad
,
are
harder
than
stones
.
Tell
him
,
*NL*
too
,
that
I
do
not
care
a
farthing
for
the
threat
he
holds
out
to
me
of
*NL*
depriving
me
of
my
profit
by
means
of
his
book
;
for
,
to
borrow
from
the
*NL*
famous
interlude
of
``
The
Perendenga
,
''
I
say
in
answer
to
him
,
``
Long
life
*NL*
to
my
lord
the
Veintiquatro
,
and
Christ
be
with
us
all
.
''
Long
life
to
the
*NL*
great
Conde
de
Lemos
,
whose
Christian
charity
and
well-known
generosity
*NL*
support
me
against
all
the
strokes
of
my
curst
fortune
;
and
long
life
to
*NL*
the
supreme
benevolence
of
His
Eminence
of
Toledo
,
Don
Bernardo
de
*NL*
Sandoval
y
Rojas
;
and
what
matter
if
there
be
no
printing-presses
in
the
*NL*
world
,
or
if
they
print
more
books
against
me
than
there
are
letters
in
*NL*
the
verses
of
Mingo
Revulgo
!
These
two
princes
,
unsought
by
any
adulation
*NL*
or
flattery
of
mine
,
of
their
own
goodness
alone
,
have
taken
it
upon
them
*NL*
to
show
me
kindness
and
protect
me
,
and
in
this
I
consider
myself
happier
*NL*
and
richer
than
if
Fortune
had
raised
me
to
her
greatest
height
in
the
*NL*
ordinary
way
.
The
poor
man
may
retain
honour
,
but
not
the
vicious
;
*NL*
poverty
may
cast
a
cloud
over
nobility
,
but
can
not
hide
it
altogether
;
*NL*
and
as
virtue
of
itself
sheds
a
certain
light
,
even
though
it
be
through
*NL*
the
straits
and
chinks
of
penury
,
it
wins
the
esteem
of
lofty
and
noble
*NL*
spirits
,
and
in
consequence
their
protection
.
Thou
needst
say
no
more
to
*NL*
him
,
nor
will
I
say
anything
more
to
thee
,
save
to
tell
thee
to
bear
in
*NL*
mind
that
this
Second
Part
of
``
Don
Quixote
''
which
I
offer
thee
is
cut
by
*NL*
the
same
craftsman
and
from
the
same
cloth
as
the
First
,
and
that
in
it
I
*NL*
present
thee
Don
Quixote
continued
,
and
at
length
dead
and
buried
,
so
*NL*
that
no
one
may
dare
to
bring
forward
any
further
evidence
against
him
,
*NL*
for
that
already
produced
is
sufficient
;
and
suffice
it
,
too
,
that
some
*NL*
reputable
person
should
have
given
an
account
of
all
these
shrewd
*NL*
lunacies
of
his
without
going
into
the
matter
again
;
for
abundance
,
even
*NL*
of
good
things
,
prevents
them
from
being
valued
;
and
scarcity
,
even
in
*NL*
the
case
of
what
is
bad
,
confers
a
certain
value
.
I
was
forgetting
to
*NL*
tell
thee
that
thou
mayest
expect
the
``
Persiles
,
''
which
I
am
now
*NL*
finishing
,
and
also

CHAPTER
I.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
INTERVIEW
THE
CURATE
AND
THE
BARBER
HAD
WITH
DON
QUIXOTE
ABOUT
HIS
*NL*
MALADY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
,
in
the
Second
Part
of
this
history
,
and
third
*NL*
sally
of
Don
Quixote
,
says
that
the
curate
and
the
barber
remained
nearly
*NL*
a
month
without
seeing
him
,
lest
they
should
recall
or
bring
back
to
his
*NL*
recollection
what
had
taken
place
.
They
did
not
,
however
,
omit
to
visit
*NL*
his
niece
and
housekeeper
,
and
charge
them
to
be
careful
to
treat
him
*NL*
with
attention
,
and
give
him
comforting
things
to
eat
,
and
such
as
were
*NL*
good
for
the
heart
and
the
brain
,
whence
,
it
was
plain
to
see
,
all
his
*NL*
misfortune
proceeded
.
The
niece
and
housekeeper
replied
that
they
did
so
,
*NL*
and
meant
to
do
so
with
all
possible
care
and
assiduity
,
for
they
could
*NL*
perceive
that
their
master
was
now
and
then
beginning
to
show
signs
of
*NL*
being
in
his
right
mind
.
This
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
curate
and
*NL*
the
barber
,
for
they
concluded
they
had
taken
the
right
course
in
*NL*
carrying
him
off
enchanted
on
the
ox-cart
,
as
has
been
described
in
the
*NL*
First
Part
of
this
great
as
well
as
accurate
history
,
in
the
last
chapter
*NL*
thereof
.
So
they
resolved
to
pay
him
a
visit
and
test
the
improvement
in
*NL*
his
condition
,
although
they
thought
it
almost
impossible
that
there
*NL*
could
be
any
;
and
they
agreed
not
to
touch
upon
any
point
connected
with
*NL*
knight-errantry
so
as
not
to
run
the
risk
of
reopening
wounds
which
were
*NL*
still
so
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
to
see
him
consequently
,
and
found
him
sitting
up
in
bed
in
a
*NL*
green
baize
waistcoat
and
a
red
Toledo
cap
,
and
so
withered
and
dried
up
*NL*
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
turned
into
a
mummy
.
They
were
very
*NL*
cordially
received
by
him
;
they
asked
him
after
his
health
,
and
he
talked
*NL*
to
them
about
himself
very
naturally
and
in
very
well-chosen
language
.
In
*NL*
the
course
of
their
conversation
they
fell
to
discussing
what
they
call
*NL*
State-craft
and
systems
of
government
,
correcting
this
abuse
and
*NL*
condemning
that
,
reforming
one
practice
and
abolishing
another
,
each
of
*NL*
the
three
setting
up
for
a
new
legislator
,
a
modern
Lycurgus
,
or
a
*NL*
brand-new
Solon
;
and
so
completely
did
they
remodel
the
State
,
that
they
*NL*
seemed
to
have
thrust
it
into
a
furnace
and
taken
out
something
quite
*NL*
different
from
what
they
had
put
in
;
and
on
all
the
subjects
they
dealt
*NL*
with
,
Don
Quixote
spoke
with
such
good
sense
that
the
pair
of
examiners
*NL*
were
fully
convinced
that
he
was
quite
recovered
and
in
his
full
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
niece
and
housekeeper
were
present
at
the
conversation
and
could
not
*NL*
find
words
enough
to
express
their
thanks
to
God
at
seeing
their
master
*NL*
so
clear
in
his
mind
;
the
curate
,
however
,
changing
his
original
plan
,
*NL*
which
was
to
avoid
touching
upon
matters
of
chivalry
,
resolved
to
test
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
recovery
thoroughly
,
and
see
whether
it
were
genuine
or
*NL*
not
;
and
so
,
from
one
subject
to
another
,
he
came
at
last
to
talk
of
the
*NL*
news
that
had
come
from
the
capital
,
and
,
among
other
things
,
he
said
it
*NL*
was
considered
certain
that
the
Turk
was
coming
down
with
a
powerful
*NL*
fleet
,
and
that
no
one
knew
what
his
purpose
was
,
or
when
the
great
storm
*NL*
would
burst
;
and
that
all
Christendom
was
in
apprehension
of
this
,
which
*NL*
almost
every
year
calls
us
to
arms
,
and
that
his
Majesty
had
made
*NL*
provision
for
the
security
of
the
coasts
of
Naples
and
Sicily
and
the
*NL*
island
of
Malta
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
His
Majesty
has
acted
like
a
prudent
*NL*
warrior
in
providing
for
the
safety
of
his
realms
in
time
,
so
that
the
*NL*
enemy
may
not
find
him
unprepared
;
but
if
my
advice
were
taken
I
would
*NL*
recommend
him
to
adopt
a
measure
which
at
present
,
no
doubt
,
his
Majesty
*NL*
is
very
far
from
thinking
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
the
curate
heard
this
he
said
to
himself
,
``
God
keep
thee
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
poor
Don
Quixote
,
for
it
seems
to
me
thou
art
precipitating
*NL*
thyself
from
the
height
of
thy
madness
into
the
profound
abyss
of
thy
*NL*
simplicity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
barber
,
who
had
the
same
suspicion
as
the
curate
,
asked
Don
*NL*
Quixote
what
would
be
his
advice
as
to
the
measures
that
he
said
ought
to
*NL*
be
adopted
;
for
perhaps
it
might
prove
to
be
one
that
would
have
to
be
*NL*
added
to
the
list
of
the
many
impertinent
suggestions
that
people
were
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
offering
to
princes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
,
master
shaver
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
will
not
be
impertinent
,
but
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
pertinent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
but
that
experience
has
shown
that
*NL*
all
or
most
of
the
expedients
which
are
proposed
to
his
Majesty
are
*NL*
either
impossible
,
or
absurd
,
or
injurious
to
the
King
and
to
the
*NL*
kingdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
,
however
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
is
neither
impossible
nor
absurd
,
*NL*
but
the
easiest
,
the
most
reasonable
,
the
readiest
and
most
expeditious
*NL*
that
could
suggest
itself
to
any
projector
's
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
take
a
long
time
to
tell
it
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
''
said
the
curate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
choose
to
tell
it
here
,
now
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
have
it
*NL*
reach
the
ears
of
the
lords
of
the
council
to-morrow
morning
,
and
some
*NL*
other
carry
off
the
thanks
and
rewards
of
my
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
part
,
''
said
the
barber
,
``
I
give
my
word
here
and
before
God
that
*NL*
I
will
not
repeat
what
your
worship
says
,
to
King
,
Rook
or
earthly
*NL*
man
--
an
oath
I
learned
from
the
ballad
of
the
curate
,
who
,
in
the
*NL*
prelude
,
told
the
king
of
the
thief
who
had
robbed
him
of
the
hundred
*NL*
gold
crowns
and
his
pacing
mule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
versed
in
stories
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
I
know
the
oath
is
a
*NL*
good
one
,
because
I
know
the
barber
to
be
an
honest
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
if
he
were
not
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
I
will
go
bail
and
answer
for
*NL*
him
that
in
this
matter
he
will
be
as
silent
as
a
dummy
,
under
pain
of
*NL*
paying
any
penalty
that
may
be
pronounced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
will
be
security
for
you
,
senor
curate
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
profession
,
''
replied
the
curate
,
``
which
is
to
keep
secrets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ods
body
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
,
``
what
more
has
his
Majesty
to
do
*NL*
but
to
command
,
by
public
proclamation
,
all
the
knights-errant
that
are
*NL*
scattered
over
Spain
to
assemble
on
a
fixed
day
in
the
capital
,
for
even
*NL*
if
no
more
than
half
a
dozen
come
,
there
may
be
one
among
them
who
alone
*NL*
will
suffice
to
destroy
the
entire
might
of
the
Turk
.
Give
me
your
*NL*
attention
and
follow
me
.
Is
it
,
pray
,
any
new
thing
for
a
single
*NL*
knight-errant
to
demolish
an
army
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
,
as
if
they
*NL*
all
had
but
one
throat
or
were
made
of
sugar
paste
?
Nay
,
tell
me
,
how
*NL*
many

are
there
filled

-LRB-
in

for

:
I
do

else
-RRB-
the
famous
Don
Belianis
were
*NL*
alive
now

or
any
one
of
the
innumerable
progeny
of
Amadis
of
Gaul
!
If
*NL*
any
these
were
alive
today
,
and
were
to
come
face
to
face
with
the
Turk
,
*NL*
by
my
faith
,
I
would
not
give
much
for
the
Turk
's
chance
.
But
God
will
*NL*
have
regard
for
his
people
,
and
will
provide
some
one
,
who
,
if
not
so
*NL*
valiant
as
the
knights-errant
of
yore
,
at
least
will
not
be
inferior
to
*NL*
them
in
spirit
;
but
God
knows
what
I
mean
,
and
I
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
exclaimed
the
niece
at
this
,
``
may
I
die
if
my
master
does
not
*NL*
want
to
turn
knight-errant
again
;
''
to
which
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
A
*NL*
knight-errant
I
shall
die
,
and
let
the
Turk
come
down
or
go
up
when
he
*NL*
likes
,
and
in
as
strong
force
as
he
can
,
once
more
I
say
,
God
knows
what
*NL*
I
mean
.
''
But
here
the
barber
said
,
``
I
ask
your
worships
to
give
me
leave
*NL*
to
tell
a
short
story
of
something
that
happened
in
Seville
,
which
comes
*NL*
so
pat
to
the
purpose
just
now
that
I
should
like
greatly
to
tell
it
.
''
*NL*
Don
Quixote
gave
him
leave
,
and
the
rest
prepared
to
listen
,
and
he
began
*NL*
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
madhouse
at
Seville
there
was
a
man
whom
his
relations
had
placed
*NL*
there
as
being
out
of
his
mind
.
He
was
a
graduate
of
Osuna
in
canon
law
;
*NL*
but
even
if
he
had
been
of
Salamanca
,
it
was
the
opinion
of
most
people
*NL*
that
he
would
have
been
mad
all
the
same
.
This
graduate
,
after
some
years
*NL*
of
confinement
,
took
it
into
his
head
that
he
was
sane
and
in
his
full
*NL*
senses
,
and
under
this
impression
wrote
to
the
Archbishop
,
entreating
him
*NL*
earnestly
,
and
in
very
correct
language
,
to
have
him
released
from
the
*NL*
misery
in
which
he
was
living
;
for
by
God
's
mercy
he
had
now
recovered
*NL*
his
lost
reason
,
though
his
relations
,
in
order
to
enjoy
his
property
,
*NL*
kept
him
there
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
truth
,
would
make
him
out
to
be
mad
*NL*
until
his
dying
day
.
The
Archbishop
,
moved
by
repeated
sensible
,
*NL*
well-written
letters
,
directed
one
of
his
chaplains
to
make
inquiry
of
*NL*
the
madhouse
as
to
the
truth
of
the
licentiate
's
statements
,
and
to
have
*NL*
an
interview
with
the
madman
himself
,
and
,
if
it
should
appear
that
he
*NL*
was
in
his
senses
,
to
take
him
out
and
restore
him
to
liberty
.
The
*NL*
chaplain
did
so
,
and
the
governor
assured
him
that
the
man
was
still
mad
,
*NL*
and
that
though
he
often
spoke
like
a
highly
intelligent
person
,
he
would
*NL*
in
the
end
break
out
into
nonsense
that
in
quantity
and
quality
*NL*
counterbalanced
all
the
sensible
things
he
had
said
before
,
as
might
be
*NL*
easily
tested
by
talking
to
him
.
The
chaplain
resolved
to
try
the
*NL*
experiment
,
and
obtaining
access
to
the
madman
conversed
with
him
for
an
*NL*
hour
or
more
,
during
the
whole
of
which
time
he
never
uttered
a
word
that
*NL*
was
incoherent
or
absurd
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
spoke
so
rationally
that
*NL*
the
chaplain
was
compelled
to
believe
him
to
be
sane
.
Among
other
things
,
*NL*
he
said
the
governor
was
against
him
,
not
to
lose
the
presents
his
*NL*
relations
made
him
for
reporting
him
still
mad
but
with
lucid
intervals
;
*NL*
and
that
the
worst
foe
he
had
in
his
misfortune
was
his
large
property
;
*NL*
for
in
order
to
enjoy
it
his
enemies
disparaged
and
threw
doubts
upon
the
*NL*
mercy
our
Lord
had
shown
him
in
turning
him
from
a
brute
beast
into
a
*NL*
man
.
In
short
,
he
spoke
in
such
a
way
that
he
cast
suspicion
on
the
*NL*
governor
,
and
made
his
relations
appear
covetous
and
heartless
,
and
*NL*
himself
so
rational
that
the
chaplain
determined
to
take
him
away
with
*NL*
him
that
the
Archbishop
might
see
him
,
and
ascertain
for
himself
the
*NL*
truth
of
the
matter
.
Yielding
to
this
conviction
,
the
worthy
chaplain
*NL*
begged
the
governor
to
have
the
clothes
in
which
the
licentiate
had
*NL*
entered
the
house
given
to
him
.
The
governor
again
bade
him
beware
of
*NL*
what
he
was
doing
,
as
the
licentiate
was
beyond
a
doubt
still
mad
;
but
*NL*
all
his
cautions
and
warnings
were
unavailing
to
dissuade
the
chaplain
*NL*
from
taking
him
away
.
The
governor
,
seeing
that
it
was
the
order
of
the
*NL*
Archbishop
,
obeyed
,
and
they
dressed
the
licentiate
in
his
own
clothes
,
*NL*
which
were
new
and
decent
.
He
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
himself
clothed
like
one
*NL*
in
his
senses
,
and
divested
of
the
appearance
of
a
madman
,
entreated
the
*NL*
chaplain
to
permit
him
in
charity
to
go
and
take
leave
of
his
comrades
*NL*
the
madmen
.
The
chaplain
said
he
would
go
with
him
to
see
what
madmen
*NL*
there
were
in
the
house
;
so
they
went
upstairs
,
and
with
them
some
of
*NL*
those
who
were
present
.
Approaching
a
cage
in
which
there
was
a
furious
*NL*
madman
,
though
just
at
that
moment
calm
and
quiet
,
the
licentiate
said
to
*NL*
him
,
`
Brother
,
think
if
you
have
any
commands
for
me
,
for
I
am
going
*NL*
home
,
as
God
has
been
pleased
,
in
his
infinite
goodness
and
mercy
,
*NL*
without
any
merit
of
mine
,
to
restore
me
my
reason
.
I
am
now
cured
and
in
*NL*
my
senses
,
for
with
God
's
power
nothing
is
impossible
.
Have
strong
hope
*NL*
and
trust
in
him
,
for
as
he
has
restored
me
to
my
original
condition
,
so
*NL*
likewise
he
will
restore
you
if
you
trust
in
him
.
I
will
take
care
to
*NL*
send
you
some
good
things
to
eat
;
and
be
sure
you
eat
them
;
for
I
would
*NL*
have
you
know
I
am
convinced
,
as
one
who
has
gone
through
it
,
that
all
*NL*
this
madness
of
ours
comes
of
having
the
stomach
empty
and
the
brains
*NL*
full
of
wind
.
Take
courage
!
take
courage
!
for
despondency
in
misfortune
*NL*
breaks
down
health
and
brings
on
death
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
all
these
words
of
the
licentiate
another
madman
in
a
cage
opposite
*NL*
that
of
the
furious
one
was
listening
;
and
raising
himself
up
from
an
old
*NL*
mat
on
which
he
lay
stark
naked
,
he
asked
in
a
loud
voice
who
it
was
that
*NL*
was
going
away
cured
and
in
his
senses
.
The
licentiate
answered
,
`
It
is
*NL*
I
,
brother
,
who
am
going
;
I
have
now
no
need
to
remain
here
any
longer

I
return
infinite
thanks
to
Heaven
that
has
had
so
great
mercy
*NL*
upon

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Mind
what
you
are
saying

do
n't
let

devil
deceive
you

'
*NL*
replied
the
madman
.
`
Keep
quiet

stay
where
you
are
,
and
you
will
save
*NL*
yourself
the
trouble
of
coming
back

*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
know
I
am
cured

returned
the
licentiate
,

that
I
shall
not
have
*NL*
to
go
stations
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You

'
said
the
madman
;
`
well

we
shall
see

God
be
with

*NL*
I
swear
to
you
by
Jupiter

whose
majesty
I
represent
on
earth
,
that
for
*NL*
this
crime
alone
,
which
Seville
is
committing
to-day
in
releasing
you
*NL*
from
this
house
,
and
treating
you
as

you

I
shall
*NL*
have
to
inflict
such
a
punishment
on

Dost

the
fiery
bolts
with
which
I
am
able
and
am
wont
to
threaten
and
*NL*
lay
waste
the
world

But
in
one
way
only
will
I
punish
this
ignorant
*NL*
town
,
and
that
is
by
not
raining
upon
it

nor
on

its
district

territory
,
for
three
whole
years
,
to
be
reckoned
from
the
day

moment
when
this
threat
is
pronounced
.
Thou
free

cured

in

and
I
mad
,

disordered

bound

will
as

*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
present
stood
listening
to
the
words
and
exclamations
of
the
*NL*
madman
;
but
our
licentiate
,
turning
to
the
chaplain
and
seizing
him
by
*NL*
the
hands
,
said
to
him
,
`
Be
not
uneasy

senor
;
attach
no
importance

what
this
madman
has
said

Jupiter

will
not

*NL*
I
,
who
am
Neptune

the
father

it
pleases
me

may
be
needful

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
governor
and
the
bystanders
laughed
,
and
at
their
laughter
the
*NL*
chaplain
was
half
ashamed
,
and
he
replied
,
`
For
all
that

when
there
is
a
better
opportunity

more
time
,

will
come
back

for
you

'
So
they
stripped
the
licentiate
,
and
he
was
left
where
he
was
;
*NL*
and
that
's
the
end
of
the
story

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
the

said
Don

,
``
which
came
in

*NL*
pat

?
Master

*NL*
master
shaver
!
how
blind
is
he
who
can
not

through
a
sieve

Is
it
*NL*
possible
that

that
comparisons
of

,
valour
*NL*
with

with

,
are
always
odious
and
*NL*
unwelcome

I
,
master
barber
,
am
not
Neptune

the
god
of
the
waters

nor
*NL*
do
I
try
to
make
anyone
take
me
for
an
astute
man
,
for
I
am
not
one
.
My
*NL*
only
endeavour
is
to
convince
the
world
of
the
mistake
it
makes
in
not
*NL*
reviving
in
itself
the
happy
time
when
the
order
of
knight-errantry
was
*NL*
in
the
field
.
But
our
depraved
age
does
not
deserve
to
enjoy
such
a
*NL*
blessing
as
those
ages
enjoyed
when
knights-errant
took
upon
their
*NL*
shoulders
the
defence
of
kingdoms
,
the
protection
of
damsels
,
the
succour
*NL*
of
orphans
and
minors
,
the
chastisement
of
the
proud
,
and
the
recompense
*NL*
of
the
humble
.
With
the
knights
of
these
days
,
for
the
most
part
,
it
is
*NL*
the
damask
,
brocade
,
and
rich
stuffs
they
wear
,
that
rustle
as
they
go
,
*NL*
not
the
chain
mail
of
their
armour
;
no
knight
now-a-days
sleeps
in
the
*NL*
open
field
exposed
to
the
inclemency
of
heaven
,
and
in
full
panoply
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
;
no
one
now
takes
a
nap
,
as
they
call
it
,
without
drawing
*NL*
his
feet
out
of
the
stirrups
,
and
leaning
upon
his
lance
,
as
the
*NL*
knights-errant
used
to
do
;
no
one
now
,
issuing
from
the
wood
,
penetrates
*NL*
yonder
mountains
,
and
then
treads
the
barren
,
lonely
shore
of
the
*NL*
sea
--
mostly
a
tempestuous
and
stormy
one
--
and
finding
on
the
beach
a
*NL*
little
bark
without
oars
,
sail
,
mast
,
or
tackling
of
any
kind
,
in
the
*NL*
intrepidity
of
his
heart
flings
himself
into
it
and
commits
himself
to
*NL*
the
wrathful
billows
of
the
deep
sea
,
that
one
moment
lift
him
up
to
*NL*
heaven
and
the
next
plunge
him
into
the
depths
;
and
opposing
his
breast
*NL*
to
the
irresistible
gale
,
finds
himself
,
when
he
least
expects
it
,
three
*NL*
thousand
leagues
and
more
away
from
the
place
where
he
embarked
;
and
*NL*
leaping
ashore
in
a
remote
and
unknown
land
has
adventures
that
deserve
*NL*
to
be
written
,
not
on
parchment
,
but
on
brass
.
But
now
sloth
triumphs
*NL*
over
energy
,
indolence
over
exertion
,
vice
over
virtue
,
arrogance
over
*NL*
courage
,
and
theory
over
practice
in
arms
,
which
flourished
and
shone
*NL*
only
in
the
golden
ages
and
in
knights-errant
.
For
tell
me
,
who
was
more
*NL*
virtuous
and
more
valiant
than
the
famous
Amadis
of
Gaul

Who

from
whom
the

of
Ferrara
*NL*
of
the
present

are
descended

according
to
Turpin
in
his
*NL*

All
these
knights
,
and
many
more
that
I
could
name

were
knights-errant

the
light

chivalry

These

carry
out

plan

in
that
case
his

find
himself
well
served
and
would
save
great
expense

*NL*
the
Turk
would
be
left
tearing
his
beard
.
And
so
I
will
stay
where
I
am

*NL*
as
the
chaplain
does
not
take

away

truly
persons
of
flesh

blood

ever
lived

on
the

contrary

I
suspect
it

*NL*
``
That
is
another
mistake

into

many
have
*NL*
fallen

do
not

there
ever
were

I
have
often

with
divers
people

on
divers
occasions

tried
to
*NL*
expose
this
almost
universal
error
to
the
light
of
truth

Sometimes
I
*NL*
have
not
been
successful

sometimes
I
have

supporting
it

clear

a
man

lofty

fair

that

were
what

describe

it

asked
the
barber

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
regard
to
giants

''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
opinions
differ
as
to
*NL*
whether
there
ever
were
any
or
not
in
the
world
;
but
the
Holy
Scripture
,
*NL*
which
can
not
err
by
a
jot
from
the
truth
,
shows
us
that
there
were
,
when
*NL*
it
gives
us
the
history
of
that
big
Philistine
,
Goliath
,
who
was
seven
*NL*
cubits
and
a
half
in
height
,
which
is
a
huge
size
.
Likewise
,
in
the
*NL*
island
of
Sicily
,
there
have
been
found
leg-bones
and
arm-bones
so
large
*NL*
that
their
size
makes
it
plain
that
their
owners
were
giants
,
and
as
tall
*NL*
as
great
towers
;
geometry
puts
this
fact
beyond
a
doubt
.
But
,
for
all
*NL*
that
,
I
can
not
speak
with
certainty
as
to
the
size
of
Morgante
,
though
I
*NL*
suspect
he
can
not
have
been
very
tall
;
and
I
am
inclined
to
be
of
this
*NL*
opinion
because
I
find
in
the
history
in
which
his
deeds
are
particularly
*NL*
mentioned
,
that
he
frequently
slept
under
a
roof
and
as
he
found
houses
*NL*
to
contain
him
,
it
is
clear
that
his
bulk
could
not
have
been
anything
*NL*
excessive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
curate
,
and
yielding
to
the
enjoyment
of
hearing
*NL*
such
nonsense
,
he
asked
him
what
was
his
notion
of
the
features
of
*NL*
Reinaldos
of
Montalban
,
and
Don
Roland
and
the
rest
of
the
Twelve
Peers
*NL*
of
France
,
for
they
were
all
knights-errant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
Reinaldos
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
venture
to
say
that
he
was
*NL*
broad-faced
,
of
ruddy
complexion
,
with
roguish
and
somewhat
prominent
*NL*
eyes
,
excessively
punctilious
and
touchy
,
and
given
to
the
society
of
*NL*
thieves

scapegraces

With

Rotolando
,
or
Orlando

the
histories

him
by
all
these
names
-RRB-
,
I
am
of
opinion
,
and
*NL*
hold
,
that
he
was
of
middle
height
,
broad-shouldered
,
rather
bow-legged
,
*NL*
swarthy-complexioned
,
red-bearded
,
with
a
hairy
body
and
a
severe
*NL*
expression
of
countenance
,
a
man
of
few
words
,

very
polite

well-bred

*NL*
``
If
Roland
was
not

more
graceful

said
the
curate

it
is
no
wonder
that
the

rejected
him

left
him
for
the
gaiety

liveliness
,
and
grace
of
that
*NL*
budding-bearded
little
Moor
to
whom
she
surrendered
herself
;
and
she
*NL*
showed
her
sense
in
falling
in
love
with
the
gentle
softness
of
Medoro
*NL*
rather
than
the
roughness
of
Roland

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Angelica

returned
Don

,
``
was
a
giddy
damsel

she
left
the
world
as
full
of
her
*NL*
vagaries
as
of
the
fame
of
her
beauty
.
She
treated
with
scorn
a
thousand
*NL*
gentlemen
,
men
of
valour

wisdom
,
and
took
up
with
a
smooth-faced

sprig

without
fortune

fame
,
except
such
reputation
for

The

the

not

sing
her

her
contemptible

probably
were
not
over
*NL*

creditable
-RRB-

dropped
her

sing

*NL*
*NL*

this
was
no

a
kind
of
prophecy
,
for
poets
are
also
called
*NL*
vates
,
that
is
to
say
diviners
;
and
its
truth
was
made
plain
;
for
since
*NL*
then
a
famous
Andalusian
poet
has
lamented

sung
her

The

the
outcry
Don

and
the
*NL*

heard
came
from
the
niece
and
the
housekeeper
exclaiming
to
*NL*
Sancho
,
who
was
striving
to
force
his
way
in
to
see
Don
Quixote
while
*NL*
they
held
the
door
against
him
,
``
What

Be
off

*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
replied
,

not
*NL*
thy

He
has
carried
me
all
over
the
world
,
and
you
are
mightily
*NL*
mistaken
.
He
enticed
me
away
from
home
by
a
trick
,
promising
me
an
*NL*
island
,

I
am
still
waiting
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
May

the

Is
it
something

thou
art

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
something

eat

replied
Sancho
,
``

something
to
govern

rule

better
than
four
cities

four
judgeships
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

said
the

``
you
do

enter
here

you
bag

mischief

go
govern
your

dig
your
*NL*
seed-patch

give
over
looking
for
islands

*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
and
the
barber
listened
with
great
amusement
to
the
words
of
*NL*
the
three
;
but
Don
Quixote
,
uneasy
lest
Sancho
should
blab
and
blurt
out
*NL*
a
whole
heap
of
mischievous
stupidities
,
and
touch
upon
points
that
might
*NL*
not
be
altogether
to
his
credit
,
called
to
him
and
made
the
other
two
*NL*
hold
their
tongues
and
let
him
come
in
.
Sancho
entered
,
and
the
curate
*NL*
and
the
barber
took
their
leave
of
Don
Quixote
,
of
whose
recovery
they
*NL*
despaired
when
they
saw
how
wedded
he
was
to
his
crazy
ideas
,
and
how
*NL*
saturated
with
the
nonsense
of
his
unlucky
chivalry
;
and
said
the
curate
*NL*
to
the
barber
,
``
You
will
see
,
gossip
,
that
when
we
are
least
thinking
of

it

our
gentleman
will
be
off
once
more
for
another
flight
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
,
''
returned
the
barber
;
``
but
I
do
not
wonder
so
*NL*
much
at
the
madness
of
the
knight
as
at
the
simplicity
of
the
squire
,
who
*NL*
has
such
a
firm
belief
in
all
that
about
the
island
,
that
I
suppose
all
*NL*
the
exposures
that
could
be
imagined
would
not
get
it
out
of
his
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
help
them
,

said
the
curate
;
``
and
let
us
be
on
the
look-out
to
see
*NL*
what
comes
of
all
these
absurdities
of
the
knight
and
squire
,
for
it
*NL*
seems
as
if
they
had
both
been
cast
in
the
same
mould
,
and
the
madness
of
*NL*
the
master
without
the
simplicity
of
the
man
would
not
be
worth
a
*NL*
farthing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,

said
the
barber
,
``
and
I
should
like
very
much
to
know
*NL*
what
the
pair
are
talking
about
at
this
moment

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
you

said
the

``
the

by-and-by

*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Don
Quixote
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
with
Sancho
,
and
when
*NL*
they
were
alone
he
said
to
him
,
``
It
grieves
me
greatly
,
Sancho
,
that
thou
*NL*
shouldst
have
said
,
and
sayest
,
that
I
took
thee
out
of
thy
cottage
,
when
*NL*
thou
knowest
I
did
not
remain
in
my
house
.
We
sallied
forth
together
,
we
*NL*
took
the
road
together
,
we
wandered
abroad
together
;
we
have
had
the
same
*NL*
fortune
and
the
same
luck
;
if
they
blanketed
thee
once
,
they
belaboured
*NL*
me
a
hundred
times
,
and
that
is
the
only
advantage
I
have
of
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
only
reasonable
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
for
,
by
what
your
worship
*NL*
says
,
misfortunes
belong
more
properly
to
knights-errant
than
to
their
*NL*
squires
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
mistaken
,
Sancho

said
Don
Quixote
,
``
according
to
the
maxim
*NL*
quando
caput
dolet

etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
any
language
but
my
own

said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
say
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
when
the
head
suffers
all
the
*NL*
members
suffer
;
and
so
,
being
thy
lord
and
master
,
I
am
thy
head
,
and
*NL*
thou
a
part
of
me
as
thou
art
my
servant
;
and
therefore
any
evil
that
*NL*
affects
or
shall
affect
me
should
give
thee
pain
,
and
what
affects
thee
*NL*
give
pain
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
should
be
so
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
when
I
was
blanketed
as
a
member
,
my
*NL*
head
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
,
looking
on
while
I
was
flying
*NL*
through
the
air
,
and
did
not
feel
any
pain
whatever
;
and
if
the
members
*NL*
are
obliged
to
feel
the
suffering
of
the
head
,
it
should
be
obliged
to
*NL*
feel
their
sufferings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
mean
to
say
now
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
I
did
not
*NL*
feel
when
they
were
blanketing
thee
?
If
thou
dost
,
thou
must
not
say
so
*NL*
or
think
so
,
for
I
felt
more
pain
then
in
spirit
than
thou
didst
in
body
.
*NL*
But
let
us
put
that
aside
for
the
present
,
for
we
shall
have
*NL*
opportunities
enough
for
considering
and
settling
the
point
;
tell
me
,
*NL*
Sancho
my
friend
,
what
do
they
say
about
me
in
the
village
here
?
What
do
*NL*
the
common
people
think
of
me
?
What
do
the
hidalgos
?
What
do
the
*NL*
caballeros
?
What
do
they
say
of
my
valour
;
of
my
achievements
;
of
my
*NL*
courtesy
?
How
do
they
treat
the
task
I
have
undertaken
in
reviving
and
*NL*
restoring
to
the
world
the
now
forgotten
order
of
chivalry
?
In
short
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
I
would
have
thee
tell
me
all
that
has
come
to
thine
ears
on
this
*NL*
subject
;
and
thou
art
to
tell
me
,
without
adding
anything
to
the
good
or
*NL*
taking
away
anything
from
the
bad
;
for
it
is
the
duty
of
loyal
vassals
to
*NL*
tell
the
truth
to
their
lords
just
as
it
is
and
in
its
proper
shape
,
not
*NL*
allowing
flattery
to
add
to
it
or
any
idle
deference
to
lessen
it
.
And
I
*NL*
would
have
thee
know
,
Sancho
,
that
if
the
naked
truth
,
undisguised
by
*NL*
flattery
,
came
to
the
ears
of
princes
,
times
would
be
different
,
and
*NL*
other
ages
would
be
reckoned
iron
ages
more
than
ours
,
which
I
hold
to
be
*NL*
the
golden
of
these
latter
days
.
Profit
by
this
advice
,
Sancho
,
and
*NL*
report
to
me
clearly
and
faithfully
the
truth
of
what
thou
knowest

Sancho

you
wish
me

out

all
its
nakedness

without
any
beating
about

``
Well
then

he
,
``
first
of

I

me
no

fool

The
hidalgos
say
that

not
keeping
within
the
bounds

your
*NL*
quality

gentleman

you
have
assumed
the

four
vine-stocks

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``

I
always

ragged

*NL*
``
As

your

there

opinions

`
valiant

*NL*
unlucky

,
`

meddling

and
then
they
go
into
such
a
*NL*
number
of
things
that
they
do
n't
leave
a
whole
bone
either
in
your

in
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Recollect

Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
wherever
virtue
exists
in
an
*NL*
eminent
degree
it
is
persecuted
.
Few
or
none
of
the
famous
men
that
have
*NL*
lived
escaped
being
calumniated
by
malice
.
Julius
Caesar
,
the
boldest
,
*NL*
wisest
,
and
bravest
of
captains
,
was
charged
with
being
ambitious
,
and
*NL*
not
particularly
cleanly
in
his
dress
,
or
pure
in
his
morals
.
Of
*NL*
Alexander
,
whose
deeds
won
him
the
name
of
Great
,
they
say
that
he
was
*NL*
somewhat
of
a
drunkard
.
Of
Hercules
,
him
of
the
many
labours
,
it
is
said
*NL*
that
he
was
lewd
and
luxurious
.
Of
Don
Galaor
,
the
brother
of
Amadis
of
*NL*
Gaul
,
it
was
whispered
that
he
was
over-quarrelsome
,
and
of
his
brother
*NL*
that
he
was
lachrymose
.
So
that
,
O
Sancho
,
amongst
all
these
calumnies
*NL*
against
good
men
,
mine
may
be
let
pass
,
since
they
are
no
more
than
thou
*NL*
hast
said
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
where
it

''
*NL*
*NL*

there

asked
Don

*NL*
*NL*

There
's
the
tail
to
be
skinned

said
Sancho
;
``
all
so

I

*NL*
home
after
having
been
made
a

,
and
when
I
went
to
welcome
him
,
*NL*
he
told
me
that
your

history
is
already
abroad
in
books
,
with
*NL*
the
title
of
THE
INGENIOUS
GENTLEMAN
DON

OF
LA
MANCHA
;

he
*NL*
says

mention
me
in
it
by
my
own
name
of
Sancho
Panza
,

the
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea

divers
things
that
happened
to
us

we
*NL*
were
alone

so
that
I
crossed
myself
in
my
wonder

the

who
*NL*
wrote
them
down
could
have
known
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
thee

Sancho

Don

,
``
the

*NL*

Sancho

him
I
spoke
of

the
author
of
the
*NL*

called
Cide

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
Moorish
name
,
''
said
Don

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
be
so

''
replied
Sancho
;
``
for
I
have
heard
say
that
the
Moors
are
*NL*
mostly
great
lovers
of
berengenas

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
must
have
mistaken

he
returned

*NL*
CHAPTER
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
LAUGHABLE
CONVERSATION
THAT
PASSED
BETWEEN
DON
QUIXOTE
,
SANCHO
*NL*
PANZA
,
AND
THE
BACHELOR
SAMSON
CARRASCO
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
remained
very
deep
in
thought
,
waiting
for
the
bachelor
*NL*
Carrasco
,
from
whom
he
was
to
hear
how
he
himself
had
been
put
into
a
*NL*
book
as
Sancho
said
;
and
he
could
not
persuade
himself
that
any
such
*NL*
history
could
be
in
existence
,
for
the
blood
of
the
enemies
he
had
slain
*NL*
was
not
yet
dry
on
the
blade
of
his
sword
,
and
now
they
wanted
to
make
*NL*
out
that
his
mighty
achievements
were
going
about
in
print
.
For
all
that
,
*NL*
he
fancied
some
sage
,
either
a
friend
or
an
enemy
,
might
,
by
the
aid
of
*NL*
magic
,
have
given
them
to
the
press
;
if
a
friend
,
in
order
to
magnify
and
*NL*
exalt
them
above
the
most
famous
ever
achieved
by
any
knight-errant
;
if
*NL*
an
enemy
,
to
bring
them
to
naught
and
degrade
them
below
the
meanest
ever
*NL*
recorded
of
any
low
squire
,
though
as
he
said
to
himself
,
the
*NL*
achievements
of
squires
never
were
recorded
.
If
,
however
,
it
were
the
*NL*
fact
that
such
a
history
were
in
existence
,
it
must
necessarily
,
being
*NL*
the
story
of
a
knight-errant
,
be
grandiloquent
,
lofty
,
imposing
,
grand
*NL*
and
true
.
With
this
he
comforted
himself
somewhat
,
though
it
made
him
*NL*
uncomfortable
to
think
that
the
author
was
a
Moor
,
judging
by
the
title
*NL*
of
``
Cide
;
''
and
that
no
truth
was
to
be
looked
for
from
Moors
,
as
they
are
*NL*
all
impostors
,
cheats
,
and
schemers
.
He
was
afraid
he
might
have
dealt
*NL*
with
his
love
affairs
in
some
indecorous
fashion
,
that
might
tend
to
the
*NL*
discredit
and
prejudice
of
the
purity
of
his
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
;
he
*NL*
would
have
had
him
set
forth
the
fidelity
and
respect
he
had
always
*NL*
observed
towards
her
,
spurning
queens
,
empresses
,
and
damsels
of
all
*NL*
sorts
,
and
keeping
in
check
the
impetuosity
of
his
natural
impulses
.
*NL*
Absorbed
and
wrapped
up
in
these
and
divers
other
cogitations
,
he
was
*NL*
found
by
Sancho
and
Carrasco
,
whom
Don
Quixote
received
with
great
*NL*
courtesy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bachelor
,
though
he
was
called
Samson
,
was
of
no
great
bodily
size
,
*NL*
but
he
was
a
very
great
wag
;
he
was
of
a
sallow
complexion
,
but
very
*NL*
sharp-witted
,
somewhere
about
four-and-twenty
years
of
age
,
with
a
round
*NL*
face
,
a
flat
nose
,
and
a
large
mouth
,
all
indications
of
a
mischievous
*NL*
disposition
and
a
love
of
fun
and
jokes
;
and
of
this
he
gave
a
sample
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
saw
Don
Quixote
,
by
falling
on
his
knees
before
him
and
*NL*
saying
,
``
Let
me
kiss
your
mightiness
's
hand
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
for
,
by
the
habit
of
St.
Peter
that
I
wear
,
though
I
have
no
more
*NL*
than
the
first
four
orders
,
your
worship
is
one
of
the
most
famous
*NL*
knights-errant
that
have
ever
been
,
or
will
be
,
all
the
world
over
.
A
*NL*
blessing
on
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
,
who
has
written
the
history
of
your
*NL*
great
deeds
,
and
a
double
blessing
on
that
connoisseur
who
took
the
*NL*
trouble
of
having
it
translated
out
of
the
Arabic
into
our
Castilian
*NL*
vulgar
tongue
for
the
universal
entertainment
of
the
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
made
him
rise
,
and
said
,
``
So
,
then
,
it
is
true
that
there
is
*NL*
a
history
of
me
,
and
that
it
was
a
Moor
and
a
sage
who
wrote
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
true
is
it
,
senor
,
''
said
Samson
,
``
that
my
belief
is
there
are
more
*NL*
than
twelve
thousand
volumes
of
the
said
history
in
print
this
very
day
.
*NL*
Only
ask
Portugal
,
Barcelona
,
and
Valencia
,
where
they
have
been
printed
,
*NL*
and
moreover
there
is
a
report
that
it
is
being
printed
at
Antwerp
,

I
*NL*
am
persuaded
there
will
not
be
a
country

there

*NL*
not

it

*NL*
``
One
of
the
things

here
observed
Don

``
that
ought
to
give
most

pleasure

in

in
type

familiar
in

a
good
name

I
say
*NL*
with
a
good
name

if
it
be
the
opposite
,
then
there
is
no
death
to
be
*NL*
compared
to
it

*NL*
``

the
bachelor

away

*NL*
``
I

``
On

the

truth

if
they
tend
to
bring
the

hero

contempt

AEneas
was
not

pious

to
write

down

*NL*
``
Well

is
that

Samson

Samson
Carrasco
,
*NL*
it
has
pleased
me
beyond

that
the
author
of
this
history
should
*NL*
have
spoken
of
me
in
such
a
way
that
what
is
said
of
me
gives
no
offence

,
on
the
faith
of
a
true
squire
,

he
had
said
anything
about
me
that
*NL*
was
at
all
unbecoming
an
old
Christian
,
such
as
I
am
,
the
deaf
would
have
*NL*
heard
of
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
working
miracles
,
''
said
Samson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miracles

no
miracles

''
said
Sancho
,
``
let
everyone
mind
how
he
speaks
*NL*

writes
about

not
set
down
at

the

that
*NL*
comes
into
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
the
faults
they
find
with
this

said
the
bachelor
,
``
is
*NL*
that
its
author
inserted
in
it
a
novel
called
`
The
Ill-advised
*NL*
Curiosity
;
'
not
that
it
is
bad
or
ill-told
,
but
that
it
is
out
of
place
*NL*
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
history
of
his
worship
Senor
Don
Quixote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
bet
the
son
of
a
dog
has
mixed
the
cabbages
and
the
baskets

*NL*
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
I
say
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
author
of
my
history
was
no
sage
,
*NL*
but
some
ignorant
chatterer
,
who
,
in
a
haphazard
and
heedless
way
,
set
*NL*
about
writing
it
,
let
it
turn
out
as
it
might
,
just
as
Orbaneja
,
the
*NL*
painter
of
Ubeda
,
used
to
do
,
who
,
when
they
asked
him
what
he
was
*NL*
painting
,
answered
,
`
What
it
may
turn
out
.
'
Sometimes
he
would
paint
a
*NL*
cock
in
such
a
fashion
,
and
so
unlike
,
that
he
had
to
write
alongside
of
*NL*
it
in
Gothic
letters
,
`
This
is
a
cock
;
and
so
it
will
be
with
my
history
,
*NL*
which
will
require
a
commentary
to
make
it
intelligible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
fear
of
that
,
''
returned
Samson
,
``
for
it
is
so
plain
that
there
is
*NL*
nothing
in
it
to
puzzle
over
;
the
children
turn
its
leaves
,
the
young
*NL*
people
read
it
,
the
grown
men
understand
it
,
the
old
folk
praise
it
;
in
a
*NL*
word
,
it
is
so
thumbed
,
and
read
,
and
got
by
heart
by
people
of
all
*NL*
sorts
,
that
the
instant
they
see
any
lean
hack
,
they
say
,
`
There
goes
*NL*
Rocinante
.
'
And
those
that
are
most
given
to
reading
it
are
the
pages
,
*NL*
for
there
is
not
a
lord
's
ante-chamber
where
there
is
not
a
`
Don
Quixote
'
*NL*
to
be
found
;
one
takes
it
up
if
another
lays
it
down
;
this
one
pounces
*NL*
upon
it
,
and
that
begs
for
it
.
In
short
,
the
said
history
is
the
most
*NL*
delightful
and
least
injurious
entertainment
that
has
been
hitherto
seen
,
*NL*
for
there
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
whole
of
it
even
the
semblance
of
an
*NL*
immodest
word
,
or
a
thought
that
is
other
than
Catholic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
write
in
any
other
way
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
would
not
be
to
write
*NL*
truth
,
but
falsehood
,
and
historians
who
have
recourse
to
falsehood
ought
*NL*
to
be
burned
,
like
those
who
coin
false
money
;
and
I
know
not
what
could
*NL*
have
led
the
author
to
have
recourse
to
novels
and
irrelevant
stories
,
*NL*
when
he
had
so
much
to
write
about
in
mine
;
no
doubt
he
must
have
gone
by
*NL*
the
proverb
`
with
straw
or
with
hay
,
etc
,
'
for
by
merely
setting
forth
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
my
sighs
,
my
tears
,
my
lofty
purposes
,
my
enterprises
,
he
might
*NL*
have
made
a
volume
as
large
,
or
larger
than
all
the
works
of
El
Tostado
*NL*
would
make
up
.
In
fact
,
the
conclusion
I
arrive
at
,
senor
bachelor
,
is
,
*NL*
that
to
write
histories
,
or
books
of
any
kind
,
there
is
need
of
great
*NL*
judgment
and
a
ripe
understanding
.
To
give
expression
to
humour
,
and
*NL*
write
in
a
strain
of
graceful
pleasantry
,
is
the
gift
of
great
geniuses
.
*NL*
The
cleverest
character
in
comedy
is
the
clown
,
for
he
who
would
make
*NL*
people
take
him
for
a
fool
,
must
not
be
one
.
History
is
in
a
measure
a
*NL*
sacred
thing
,
for
it
should
be
true
,
and
where
the
truth
is
,
there
God
*NL*
is
;
but
notwithstanding
this
,
there
are
some
who
write
and
fling
books
*NL*
broadcast
on
the
world
as
if
they
were
fritters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
book
so
bad
but
it
has
something
good
in
it
,
''
said
the
*NL*
bachelor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
of
that
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
it
often
happens
that
those
*NL*
who
have
acquired
and
attained
a
well-deserved
reputation
by
their
*NL*
writings
,
lose
it
entirely
,
or
damage
it
in
some
degree
,
when
they
give
*NL*
them
to
the
press
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
reason
of
that
,
''
said
Samson
,
``
is
,
that
as
printed
works
are
*NL*
examined
leisurely
,
their
faults
are
easily
seen
;
and
the
greater
the
*NL*
fame
of
the
writer
,
the
more
closely
are
they
scrutinised
.
Men
famous
for
*NL*
their
genius
,
great
poets
,
illustrious
historians
,
are
always
,
or
most
*NL*
commonly
,
envied
by
those
who
take
a
particular
delight
and
pleasure
in
*NL*
criticising
the
writings
of
others
,
without
having
produced
any
of
their
*NL*
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
no
wonder
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
there
are
many
divines
who
*NL*
are
no
good
for
the
pulpit
,
but
excellent
in
detecting
the
defects
or
*NL*
excesses
of
those
who
preach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
is
true
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
''
said
Carrasco
;
``
but
I
wish
such
*NL*
fault-finders
were
more
lenient
and
less
exacting
,
and
did
not
pay
so
*NL*
much
attention
to
the
spots
on
the
bright
sun
of
the
work
they
grumble
*NL*
at
;
for
if
aliquando
bonus
dormitat
Homerus
,
they
should
remember
how
*NL*
long
he
remained
awake
to
shed
the
light
of
his
work
with
as
little
shade
*NL*
as
possible
;
and
perhaps
it
may
be
that
what
they
find
fault
with
may
be
*NL*
moles
,
that
sometimes
heighten
the
beauty
of
the
face
that
bears
them
;
*NL*
and
so
I
say
very
great
is
the
risk
to
which
he
who
prints
a
book
exposes
*NL*
himself
,
for
of
all
impossibilities
the
greatest
is
to
write
one
that
*NL*
will
satisfy
and
please
all
readers

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
which
treats
of
me
must
have
pleased
few
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
the
contrary
,
''
said
the
bachelor
;
``
for
,
as
stultorum
infinitum

innumerable
are
those
who
have
relished
the

but
*NL*
some
have
brought
a
charge
against

memory

inasmuch
as
he
*NL*
forgot
to
say
who
the
thief
was
who
stole
Sancho

Dapple

for
it
is
not

stated
there

only
to
be
inferred
from
what
is
set
down

that
he
was

stolen

a
little
farther
on
we
see
Sancho
mounted
on

They

did

that
he
found
in
the
valise

the

never
alludes

be
glad

Sancho

he
made
off

Don

begged

from

I
seated
on

weary
with

fell
asleep

he
put

easy
matter
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
it
is
no
new
occurrence
,
*NL*
for
the
same
thing
happened
to
Sacripante
at
the
siege
of
Albracca
;
the
*NL*
famous
thief
,
Brunello
,
by
the
same
contrivance
,
took
his
horse
from
*NL*
between
his
legs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Day
came
,
''
continued
Sancho
,
``
and
the
moment
I
stirred
the
stakes
gave
*NL*
way
and
I
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
mighty
come
down
;
I
looked
about
for
*NL*
the
ass
,
but
could
not
see
him
;
the
tears
rushed
to
my
eyes
and
I
raised
*NL*
such
a
lamentation
that
,
if
the
author
of
our
history
has
not
put
it
in
,
*NL*
he
may
depend
upon
it
he
has
left
out
a
good
thing
.
Some
days
after
,
I
*NL*
know
not
how
many
,
travelling
with
her
ladyship
the
Princess
Micomicona
,
*NL*
I
saw
my
ass
,
and
mounted
upon
him
,
in
the
dress
of
a
gipsy
,
was
that
*NL*
Gines
de
Pasamonte
,
the
great
rogue
and
rascal
that
my
master
and
I
freed
*NL*
from
the
chain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
where
the
mistake
is
,
''
replied
Samson
;
``
it
is
,
that
before
*NL*
the
ass
has
turned
up
,
the
author
speaks
of
Sancho
as
being
mounted
on
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
that
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
unless
that
the
*NL*
historian
made
a
mistake
,
or
perhaps
it
might
be
a
blunder
of
the
*NL*
printer
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
that
's
it
,
''
said
Samson
;
``
but
what
became
of
the
hundred
*NL*
crowns
?
Did
they
vanish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
answered
,
``
I
spent
them
for
my
own
good
,
and
my
wife
's
,
*NL*
and
my
children
's
,
and
it
is
they
that
have
made
my
wife
bear
so
*NL*
patiently
all
my
wanderings
on
highways
and
byways
,
in
the
service
of
my
*NL*
master
,
Don
Quixote
;
for
if
after
all
this
time
I
had
come
back
to
the
*NL*
house
without
a
rap
and
without
the
ass
,
it
would
have
been
a
poor
*NL*
look-out
for
me
;
and
if
anyone
wants
to
know
anything
more
about
me
,
here
*NL*
I
am
,
ready
to
answer
the
king
himself
in
person
;
and
it
is
no
affair
of
*NL*
anyone
's
whether
I
took
or
did
not
take
,
whether
I
spent
or
did
not
*NL*
spend
;
for
the
whacks
that
were
given
me
in
these
journeys
were
to
be
*NL*
paid
for
in
money
,
even
if
they
were
valued
at
no
more
than
four
*NL*
maravedis
apiece
,
another
hundred
crowns
would
not
pay
me
for
half
of
*NL*
them
.
Let
each
look
to
himself
and
not
try
to
make
out
white
black
,
and
*NL*
black
white
;
for
each
of
us
is
as
God
made
him
,
aye
,
and
often
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
care
,
''
said
Carrasco
,
``
to
impress
upon
the

what
worthy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything

asked
*NL*
Don

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

replied
he
;

not
anything

*NL*
``
Does

Don

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
promise
one

replied
Samson
;
``

he
says
he

not

he

can
not

so

on

have

Don

Quixote
charge
and
Sancho
chatter
,

no

what
it
may
turn
out

we
*NL*
shall
be
satisfied
with
that
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
the

mean
to
do

said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
replied
Samson
;
``
why
,
as
soon
as
he
has
found
the
history

*NL*
he
is
now
searching
for
with
extraordinary
diligence
,
he
will
at
once
*NL*
give
it
to
the
press
,
moved
more
by
the
profit
that
may
accrue
to
him
*NL*
from
doing
so
than
by
any
thought
of
praise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereat
Sancho
observed
,
``
The
author
looks
for
money
and
profit
,
does
he
?
*NL*
It
will
be
a
wonder
if
he
succeeds
,
for
it
will
be
only
hurry
,
hurry
,
*NL*
with
him
,
like
the
tailor
on
Easter
Eve
;
and
works
done
in
a
hurry
are
*NL*
never
finished
as
perfectly
as
they
ought
to
be
.
Let
master
Moor
,
or
*NL*
whatever
he
is
,
pay
attention
to
what
he
is
doing
,
and
I
and
my
master
*NL*
will
give
him
as
much
grouting
ready
to
his
hand
,
in
the
way
of
*NL*
adventures
and
accidents
of
all
sorts
,
as
would
make
up
not
only
one
*NL*
second
part
,
but
a
hundred
.
The
good
man
fancies
,
no
doubt
,
that
we
are
*NL*
fast
asleep
in
the
straw
here
,
but
let
him
hold
up
our
feet
to
be
shod
*NL*
and
he
will
see
which
foot
it
is
we
go
lame
on
.
All
I
say
is
,
that
if
my
*NL*
master
would
take
my
advice
,
we
would
be
now
afield
,
redressing
outrages
*NL*
and
righting
wrongs
,
as
is
the
use
and
custom
of
good
knights-errant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
had
hardly
uttered
these
words
when
the
neighing
of
Rocinante
fell
*NL*
upon
their
ears
,
which
neighing
Don
Quixote
accepted
as
a
happy
omen
,
and
*NL*
he
resolved
to
make
another
sally
in
three
or
four
days
from
that
time
.
*NL*
Announcing
his
intention
to
the
bachelor
,
he
asked
his
advice
as
to
the
*NL*
quarter
in
which
he
ought
to
commence
his
expedition
,
and
the
bachelor
*NL*
replied
that
in
his
opinion
he
ought
to
go
to
the
kingdom
of
Aragon
,
and
*NL*
the
city
of
Saragossa
,
where
there
were
to
be
certain
solemn
joustings
at
*NL*
the
festival
of
St.
George
,
at
which
he
might
win
renown
above
all
the
*NL*
knights
of
Aragon
,
which
would
be
winning
it
above
all
the
knights
of
the
*NL*
world
.
He
commended
his
very
praiseworthy
and
gallant
resolution
,
but
*NL*
admonished
him
to
proceed
with
greater
caution
in
encountering
dangers
,
*NL*
because
his
life
did
not
belong
to
him
,
but
to
all
those
who
had
need
of
*NL*
him
to
protect
and
aid
them
in
their
misfortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
where
it
is
,
what
I
abominate
,
Senor
Samson
,
''
said
Sancho
here
;
*NL*
``
my
master
will
attack
a
hundred
armed
men
as
a
greedy
boy
would
half
a
*NL*
dozen
melons
.
Body
of
the
world
,
senor
bachelor
!
there
is
a
time
to
*NL*
attack
and
a
time
to
retreat
,
and
it
is
not
to
be
always
`
Santiago
,
and
*NL*
close
Spain
!
'
Moreover
,
I
have
heard
it
said
-LRB-
and
I
think
by
my
master
*NL*
himself
,
if
I
remember
rightly
-RRB-
that
the
mean
of
valour
lies
between
the
*NL*
extremes
of
cowardice
and
rashness
;
and
if
that
be
so
,
I
do
n't
want
him
*NL*
to
fly
without
having
good
reason
,
or
to
attack
when
the
odds
make
it
*NL*
better
not
.
But
,
above
all
things
,
I
warn
my
master
that
if
he
is
to
take
*NL*
me
with
him
it
must
be
on
the
condition
that
he
is
to
do
all
the
*NL*
fighting
,
and
that
I
am
not
to
be
called
upon
to
do
anything
except
what
*NL*
concerns
keeping
him
clean
and
comfortable
;
in
this
I
will
dance
*NL*
attendance
on
him
readily
;
but
to
expect
me
to
draw
sword
,
even
against
*NL*
rascally
churls
of
the
hatchet
and
hood
,
is
idle
.
I
do
n't
set
up
to
be
a
*NL*
fighting
man
,
Senor
Samson
,
but
only
the
best
and
most
loyal
squire
that
*NL*
ever
served
knight-errant
;
and
if
my
master
Don
Quixote
,
in
consideration
*NL*
of
my
many
faithful
services
,
is
pleased
to
give
me
some
island
of
the
*NL*
many
his
worship
says
one
may
stumble
on
in
these
parts
,
I
will
take
it
*NL*
as
a
great
favour
;
and
if
he
does
not
give
it
to
me
,
I
was
born
like
*NL*
everyone
else
,
and
a
man
must
not
live
in
dependence
on
anyone
except
*NL*
God
;
and
what
is
more
,
my
bread
will
taste
as
well
,
and
perhaps
even
*NL*
better
,
without
a
government
than
if
I
were
a
governor
;
and
how
do
I
know
*NL*
but
that
in
these
governments
the
devil
may
have
prepared
some
trip
for
*NL*
me
,
to
make
me
lose
my
footing
and
fall
and
knock
my
grinders
out
?
Sancho
*NL*
I
was
born
and
Sancho
I
mean
to
die

But
for
all
that
,
if
heaven
were
to
*NL*
make
me
a
fair
offer
of
an
island
or
something
else
of
the
kind
,
without
*NL*
much
trouble
and
without
much
risk

I
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
refuse
it
;

for
they
say
,
too

offer
thee
a
heifer

run
with

thee

*NL*
``
Brother

said
Carrasco
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Take

said
Samson
;
``

change
manners

bore

you
.

*NL*
``

hold

Sancho
,
*NL*
``

have
.
Nay
,
only
look

that
likely

show
ingratitude

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant

said
Don
Quixote
;
``
we
shall
see
when
the
government
*NL*

and
I
seem
to
see
it
already

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
begged
the
bachelor
,
if
he
were
a
poet
,
to
do
him
the
favour
of
*NL*
composing
some
verses
for
him
conveying
the
farewell
he
meant
to
take
of
*NL*
his
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
and
to
see
that
a
letter
of
her
name
was
*NL*
placed
at
the
beginning
of
each
line
,
so
that
,
at
the
end
of
the
verses
,
*NL*
``
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
''
might
be
read
by
putting
together
the
first
*NL*
letters
.
The
bachelor
replied
that
although
he
was
not
one
of
the
famous
*NL*
poets
of
Spain
,
who
were
,
they
said
,
only
three
and
a
half
,
he
would
not
*NL*
fail
to
compose
the
required
verses
;
though
he
saw
a
great
difficulty
in
*NL*
the
task
,
as
the
letters
which
made
up
the
name
were
seventeen
;
so
,
if
he
*NL*
made
four
ballad
stanzas
of
four
lines
each
,
there
would
be
a
letter
*NL*
over
,
and
if
he
made
them
of
five
,
what
they
called
decimas
or
*NL*
redondillas
,
there
were
three
letters
short
;
nevertheless
he
would
try
to
*NL*
drop
a
letter
as
well
as
he
could
,
so
that
the
name
``
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
''
*NL*
might
be
got
into
four
ballad
stanzas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
unless
the
*NL*
name
stands
there
plain
and
manifest
,
no
woman
would
believe
the
verses
*NL*
were
made
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
agreed
upon
this
,
and
that
the
departure
should
take
place
in
three
*NL*
days
from
that
time
.
Don
Quixote
charged
the
bachelor
to
keep
it
a
*NL*
secret
,
especially
from
the
curate
and
Master
Nicholas
,
and
from
his
*NL*
niece
and
the
housekeeper
,
lest
they
should
prevent
the
execution
of
his
*NL*
praiseworthy
and
valiant
purpose
.
Carrasco
promised
all
,
and
then
took
*NL*
his
leave
,
charging
Don
Quixote
to
inform
him
of
his
good
or
evil
*NL*
fortunes
whenever
he
had
an
opportunity
;
and
thus
they
bade
each
other
*NL*
farewell

Sancho
went
away
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
for

CHAPTER
V.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
SHREWD
AND
DROLL
CONVERSATION
THAT
PASSED
BETWEEN
SANCHO
PANZA
AND
*NL*
HIS
WIFE
TERESA
PANZA
,
AND
OTHER
MATTERS
WORTHY
OF
BEING
DULY
RECORDED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
translator
of
this
history
,
when
he
comes
to
write
this
fifth
*NL*
chapter
,
says
that
he
considers
it
apocryphal
,
because
in
it
Sancho
Panza
*NL*
speaks
in
a
style
unlike
that
which
might
have
been
expected
from
his
*NL*
limited
intelligence
,
and
says
things
so
subtle
that
he
does
not
think
it
*NL*
possible
he
could
have
conceived
them
;
however
,
desirous
of
doing
what
*NL*
his
task
imposed
upon
him
,
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
it
untranslated
,
and
*NL*
therefore
he
went
on
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
came
home
in
such
glee
and
spirits
that
his
wife
noticed
his
*NL*
happiness
a
bowshot
off
,
so
much
so
that
it
made
her
ask
him
,
``
What
have
*NL*
you
got
,
Sancho
friend
,
that
you
are
so
glad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
he
replied
,
``
Wife
,
if
it
were
God
's
will
,
I
should
be
very
glad
*NL*
not
to
be
so
well
pleased
as
I
show
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you

said
she
,
``
and
I
do
n't

what
you
*NL*

by
saying
you
would
be
glad
,
if
it
were
God
's
will
,
not
to
be
well
*NL*
pleased
;
for
,
fool
as
I
am
,
I
do
n't
know
how
one
can
find
pleasure
in
not
*NL*
having
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
ye
,
Teresa
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
I
am
glad
because
I
have
made
up
my
*NL*
mind
to
go
back
to
the
service
of
my
master
Don
Quixote
,
who
means
to
go
*NL*
out
a
third
time
to
seek
for
adventures
;
and
I
am
going
with
him
again
,
*NL*
for
my
necessities
will
have
it
so
,
and
also
the
hope
that
cheers
me
with
*NL*
the
thought
that
I
may
find
another
hundred
crowns
like
those
we
have
*NL*
spent
;
though
it
makes
me
sad
to
have
to
leave
thee
and
the
children
;
and
*NL*
if
God
would
be
pleased
to
let
me
have
my
daily
bread
,
dry-shod
and
at
*NL*
home
,
without
taking
me
out
into
the
byways
and
cross-roads
--
and
he
could
*NL*
do
it
at
small
cost
by
merely
willing
it
--
it
is
clear
my
happiness
would
*NL*
be
more
solid
and
lasting
,
for
the
happiness
I
have
is
mingled
with
*NL*
sorrow
at
leaving
thee
;
so
that
I
was
right
in
saying
I
would
be
glad
,
if
*NL*
it
were
God
's
will
,
not
to
be
well
pleased

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Teresa
;
``
ever
since
you
joined
on
to
a
*NL*
knight-errant
you
talk
in
such
a
roundabout
way
that
there
is
no
*NL*
understanding
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
enough
that
God
understands
me
,
wife
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
for
he
is
*NL*
the
understander
of
all
things
;
that
will
do
;
but
mind
,
sister
,
you
must
*NL*
look
to
Dapple
carefully
for
the
next
three
days
,
so
that
he
may
be
fit
*NL*
to
take
arms
;
double
his
feed
,
and
see
to
the
pack-saddle
and
other
*NL*
harness
,
for
it
is
not
to
a
wedding
we
are
bound
,
but
to
go
round
the
*NL*
world
,
and
play
at
give
and
take
with
giants
and
dragons
and
monsters
,
*NL*
and
hear
hissings
and
roarings
and
bellowings
and
howlings
;
and
even
all
*NL*
this
would
be
lavender
,
if
we
had
not
to
reckon
with
Yanguesans
and
*NL*
enchanted
Moors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
well
enough

said
Teresa
,
``
that
squires-errant
do
n't
*NL*
eat
their
bread
for
nothing

so
I
will
be
always
praying

our
Lord
*NL*
to
deliver
you
speedily
from
all
that
hard
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
,

''
said
Sancho
,
``
if
I
did
not
expect
to
see
myself
*NL*
governor
of
an
island
before
long
,
I
would
drop
down
dead
on
the
spot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
then
,
husband
,
''
said
Teresa
;
``
let
the
hen
live
,
though
it
be
with
*NL*
her
pip
,
live
,
and
let
the
devil
take
all
the
governments
in
the
world
;
*NL*
you
came
out
of
your
mother
's
womb
without
a
government
,
you
have
lived
*NL*
until
now
without
a
government
,
and
when
it
is
God
's
will
you
will
go
,
or
*NL*
be
carried
,
to
your
grave
without
a
government
.
How
many
there
are
in
the
*NL*
world
who
live
without
a
government
,
and
continue
to
live
all
the
same
,
*NL*
and
are
reckoned
in
the
number
of
the
people
.
The
best
sauce
in
the
world
*NL*
is
hunger
,
and
as
the
poor
are
never
without
that
,
they
always
eat
with
a
*NL*
relish
.
But
mind
,
Sancho
,
if
by
good
luck
you
should
find
yourself
with
*NL*
some
government
,
do
n't
forget
me
and
your
children
.
Remember
that
*NL*
Sanchico
is
now
full
fifteen
,
and
it
is
right
he
should
go
to
school
,
if
*NL*
his
uncle
the
abbot
has
a
mind
to
have
him
trained
for
the
Church
.
*NL*
Consider
,
too
,
that
your
daughter
Mari-Sancha
will
not
die
of
grief
if
we
*NL*
marry
her
;
for
I
have
my
suspicions
that
she
is
as
eager
to
get
a
husband
*NL*
as
you
to
get
a
government
;
and
,
after
all
,
a
daughter
looks
better
ill
*NL*
married
than
well
whored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
faith
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
if
God
brings
me
to
get
any
sort
of
a
*NL*
government

I
intend

to
make
such
a
high
match
for
Mari-Sancha

there
will
be
no
approaching
her
without
calling
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Sancho

''
returned
Teresa
;
``
marry
her
to
her
equal

that
is
the
*NL*
safest
plan

clogs
into
high-heeled

out
of
her
grey
flannel
petticoat

out

So-and-so

*NL*
the

at

she
will
fall
into

thousand
blunders

the
thread
of
her
coarse
homespun
*NL*
stuff

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut

you
fool

said
Sancho
;
``
it
will
be
only
to
practise
it
for
two

*NL*
three
years
;
and
then
dignity

decorum

fit
her
as
easily
as
a
*NL*

;

if
not

Let
her
be
`

never

*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
to

replied
Teresa
;
``
do
n't
try

raise

yourself

the
nose
*NL*
of

take
him
into

A
fine
thing
it
*NL*
would
be
,
indeed
,
to
marry
our
Maria
to
some
great
count

grand
*NL*
gentleman

,
when
the
humour
took
him

would
abuse
her

call
her

clown-bred

I
have
not
been
*NL*
bringing
up

that
all

tell
you

Do
you
bring
home
money

Sancho

Lope

sturdy

I
can
see
he
does
not
look
sour
at
the
girl

with
him
,
one
*NL*
of
our
own
sort

she
will
be
well
married

we
shall
have
her
always
*NL*
under
our
eyes

be
all
one
family

parents

*NL*
grandchildren

sons-in-law

the
peace

blessing
of
God
will
*NL*
dwell
among
us

so
do
n't
you
go
marrying
her
in
those
courts
and
grand
*NL*
palaces
where
they
wo
n't

what

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Sancho

no

now
that

knocking
at

it
will
not
do

shut
it
out

let
us
go
with
the
favouring
breeze
*NL*
that
blows
upon
us

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
this
sort
of
talk

what
Sancho
says
lower
down

that
made
the
*NL*
translator
of
the
history
say
he
considered
this
chapter
apocryphal

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

continued
Sancho

lift
us

mire

*NL*
``
Are

Well

You
do

I
can
tell
*NL*
you
it

a
plain

simple

without
any
additions

tags
or

my

I

I
am
called

by
right
I
ought

be
called
Teresa
Cascajo

`
kings
go
where
*NL*
laws
like

I
am
content
with
this
name
without
having
the
`
Don

put
*NL*
on
top
of
it
to
make
it
so
heavy
that
I
can
not
carry
it
;

I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
make
people
talk
about
me
when
they
see
me
go
dressed
like
a

for
they
will
say
at
once
,
`
See
what
airs
the
slut
*NL*
gives
herself

Only
yesterday
she
was
always
spinning
flax

used

*NL*
go
to
mass
with
the
tail

her
petticoat
over
her
head

mantle

there
she
goes
to-day
in
a
hooped
gown
with
her
broaches

*NL*
airs
,
as
if
we
did
n't
know
her

If
God
keeps
me
in
my
seven
senses

five

I

not

*NL*
said
,
if
I
remember
rightly
,
that
all
things
present
that
our
eyes
*NL*
behold
,
bring
themselves
before
us
,
and
remain
and
fix
themselves
on
our
*NL*
memory
much
better
and
more
forcibly
than
things
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
observations
which
Sancho
makes
here
are
the
other
ones
on
account
*NL*
of
which
the
translator
says
he
regards
this
chapter
as
apocryphal
,
*NL*
inasmuch
as
they
are
beyond
Sancho
's
capacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whence
it
arises
,
''
he
continued
,
``
that
when
we
see
any
person
well
*NL*
dressed
and
making
a
figure
with
rich
garments
and
retinue
of
servants
,
*NL*
it
seems
to
lead
and
impel
us
perforce
to
respect
him
,
though
memory
may
*NL*
at
the
same
moment
recall
to
us
some
lowly
condition
in
which
we
have
*NL*
seen
him
,
but
which
,
whether
it
may
have
been
poverty
or
low
birth
,
being
*NL*
now
a
thing
of
the
past
,
has
no
existence
;
while
the
only
thing
that
has
*NL*
any
existence
is
what
we
see
before
us
;
and
if
this
person
whom
fortune
*NL*
has
raised
from
his
original
lowly
state

were
the
very
words

will
remember

the
envious

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

replied
Teresa
;
``

as

Teresa
;

I

I

if
*NL*
you
are
bent
upon
having
a
government
,
take
your
son
Sancho
with
you
,
and
*NL*
teach
him
from
this
time
on
how
to
hold
a
government

for
sons
ought
to

inherit

learn
the
trades
of
their

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
I
have
the

said
Sancho
,
``
I
will
send

him
by

post
,
and
I
will
send
thee
money

of

I
shall
have
no
lack

for
*NL*
there
is
never
any
want
of
people
to
lend
it
to

they
have

not

it

do
thou
dress
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

I

up

fine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
are
agreed
that
our
daughter
is
to
be

said
Sancho

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
that
I
see

Teresa
,

it
will
be
the

*NL*
to
me

I
was
burying

once
more
I

do
as
you

are
born
to
this
burden

being
obedient
to
our
husbands

*NL*
though
they
be
dogs

and
with
this
she
began
to
weep
in
earnest
,
as
if
*NL*
she
already
saw
Sanchica
dead
and
buried

*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
consoled
her
by
saying
that
though
he
must
make
her
a
countess

he
*NL*
would
put
it
off
as
long
as
possible

Here
their
conversation
came
to
an

end

went
back
to

CHAPTER
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
TOOK
PLACE
BETWEEN
DON
QUIXOTE
AND
HIS
NIECE
AND
HOUSEKEEPER
;
ONE
*NL*
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
CHAPTERS
IN
THE
WHOLE
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Sancho
Panza
and
his
wife
,
Teresa
Cascajo
,
held
the
above
*NL*
irrelevant
conversation
,
Don
Quixote
's
niece
and
housekeeper
were
not
*NL*
idle
,
for
by
a
thousand
signs
they
began
to
perceive
that
their
uncle
and
*NL*
master
meant
to
give
them
the
slip
the
third
time
,
and
once
more
betake
*NL*
himself
to
his
,
for
them
,
ill-errant
chivalry
.
They
strove
by
all
the
*NL*
means
in
their
power
to
divert
him
from
such
an
unlucky
scheme
;
but
it
*NL*
was
all
preaching
in
the
desert
and
hammering
cold
iron
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
among
many
other
representations
made
to
him
,
the
housekeeper
said
to
*NL*
him
,
``
In
truth
,
master
,
if
you
do
not
keep
still
and
stay
quiet
at
home
,
*NL*
and
give
over
roaming
mountains
and
valleys
like
a
troubled
spirit
,
*NL*
looking
for
what
they
say
are
called
adventures
,
but
what
I
call
*NL*
misfortunes
,
I
shall
have
to
make
complaint
to
God
and
the
king
with
loud
*NL*
supplication
to
send
some
remedy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
What
answer
God
will
give
to
your
*NL*
complaints
,
housekeeper
,
I
know
not
,
nor
what
his
Majesty
will
answer
*NL*
either
;
I
only
know
that
if
I
were
king
I
should
decline
to
answer
the
*NL*
numberless
silly
petitions
they
present
every
day
;
for
one
of
the
*NL*
greatest
among
the
many
troubles
kings
have
is
being
obliged
to
listen
to
*NL*
all
and
answer
all
,
and
therefore
I
should
be
sorry
that
any
affairs
of
*NL*
mine
should
worry
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
the
housekeeper
said
,
``
Tell
us
,
senor
,
at
his
Majesty
's
court
*NL*
are
there
no
knights
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
plenty
of
them
;
and
it
is
right
*NL*
there
should
be
,
to
set
off
the
dignity
of
the
prince
,
and
for
the
*NL*
greater
glory
of
the
king
's
majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
might
not
your
worship
,
''
said
she
,
``
be
one
of
those
that
,
without
*NL*
stirring
a
step
,
serve
their
king
and
lord
in
his
court
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Recollect
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
all
knights
can
not
be
*NL*
courtiers
,
nor
can
all
courtiers
be
knights-errant
,
nor
need
they
be
.
*NL*
There
must
be
all
sorts
in
the
world
;
and
though
we
may
be
all
knights
,
*NL*
there
is
a
great
difference
between
one
and
another
;
for
the
courtiers
,
*NL*
without
quitting
their
chambers
,
or
the
threshold
of
the
court
,
range
the
*NL*
world
over
by
looking
at
a
map
,
without
its
costing
them
a
farthing
,
and
*NL*
without
suffering
heat
or
cold
,
hunger
or
thirst
;
but
we
,
the
true
*NL*
knights-errant
,
measure
the
whole
earth
with
our
own
feet
,
exposed
to
the
*NL*
sun
,
to
the
cold
,
to
the
air
,
to
the
inclemencies
of
heaven
,
by
day
and
*NL*
night
,
on
foot
and
on
horseback
;
nor
do
we
only
know
enemies
in
pictures
,
*NL*
but
in
their
own
real
shapes
;
and
at
all
risks
and
on
all
occasions
we
*NL*
attack
them
,
without
any
regard
to
childish
points
or
rules
of
single
*NL*
combat
,
whether
one
has
or
has
not
a
shorter
lance
or
sword
,
whether
one
*NL*
carries
relics
or
any
secret
contrivance
about
him
,
whether
or
not
the
*NL*
sun
is
to
be
divided
and
portioned
out
,
and
other
niceties
of
the
sort
*NL*
that
are
observed
in
set
combats
of
man
to
man
,
that
you
know
nothing
*NL*
about
,
but
I
do
.
And
you
must
know
besides
,
that
the
true
knight-errant
,
*NL*
though
he
may
see
ten
giants
,
that
not
only
touch
the
clouds
with
their
*NL*
heads
but
pierce
them
,
and
that
go
,
each
of
them
,
on
two
tall
towers
by
*NL*
way
of
legs
,
and
whose
arms
are
like
the
masts
of
mighty
ships
,
and
each
*NL*
eye
like
a
great
mill-wheel
,
and
glowing
brighter
than
a
glass
furnace
,
*NL*
must
not
on
any
account
be
dismayed
by
them
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
must
*NL*
attack
and
fall
upon
them
with
a
gallant
bearing
and
a
fearless
heart
,
*NL*
and
,
if
possible
,
vanquish
and
destroy
them
,
even
though
they
have
for
*NL*
armour
the
shells
of
a
certain
fish
,
that
they
say
are
harder
than
*NL*
diamonds
,
and
in
place
of
swords
wield
trenchant
blades
of
Damascus
*NL*
steel
,
or
clubs
studded
with
spikes
also
of
steel
,
such
as
I
have
more
*NL*
than
once
seen
.
All
this
I
say
,
housekeeper
,
that
you
may
see
the
*NL*
difference
there
is
between
the
one
sort
of
knight
and
the
other
;
and
it
*NL*
would
be
well
if
there
were
no
prince
who
did
not
set
a
higher
value
on
*NL*
this
second
,
or
more
properly
speaking
first
,
kind
of
knights-errant
;
*NL*
for
,
as
we
read
in
their
histories
,
there
have
been
some
among
them
who
*NL*
have
been
the
salvation
,
not
merely
of
one
kingdom
,
but
of
many
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
senor
,
''
here
exclaimed
the
niece
,
``
remember
that
all
this
you
are
*NL*
saying
about
knights-errant
is
fable
and
fiction
;
and
their
histories
,
if
*NL*
indeed
they
were
not
burned
,
would
deserve
,
each
of
them
,
to
have
a
*NL*
sambenito
put
on
it
,
or
some
mark
by
which
it
might
be
known
as
infamous
*NL*
and
a
corrupter
of
good
manners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
God
that
gives
me
life
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
thou
wert
not
my
*NL*
full
niece
,
being
daughter
of
my
own
sister
,
I
would
inflict
a
*NL*
chastisement
upon
thee
for
the
blasphemy
thou
hast
uttered
that
all
the
*NL*
world
should
ring
with
.
What
!
can
it
be
that
a
young
hussy
that
hardly
*NL*
knows
how
to
handle
a
dozen
lace-bobbins
dares
to
wag
her
tongue
and
*NL*
criticise
the
histories
of
knights-errant
?
What
would
Senor
Amadis
say
if
*NL*
he
heard
of
such
a
thing
?
He
,
however
,
no
doubt
would
forgive
thee
,
for
*NL*
he
was
the
most
humble-minded
and
courteous
knight
of
his
time
,
and
*NL*
moreover
a
great
protector
of
damsels
;
but
some
there
are
that
might
have
*NL*
heard
thee
,
and
it
would
not
have
been
well
for
thee
in
that
case
;
for
*NL*
they
are
not
all
courteous
or
mannerly
;
some
are
ill-conditioned
*NL*
scoundrels
;
nor
is
it
everyone
that
calls
himself
a
gentleman
,
that
is
so
*NL*
in
all
respects
;
some
are
gold
,
others
pinchbeck
,
and
all
look
like
*NL*
gentlemen
,
but
not
all
can
stand
the
touchstone
of
truth
.
There
are
men
*NL*
of
low
rank
who
strain
themselves
to
bursting
to
pass
for
gentlemen
,
and
*NL*
high
gentlemen
who
,
one
would
fancy
,
were
dying
to
pass
for
men
of
low
*NL*
rank
;
the
former
raise
themselves
by
their
ambition
or
by
their
virtues
,
*NL*
the
latter
debase
themselves
by
their
lack
of
spirit
or
by
their
vices
;
*NL*
and
one
has
need
of
experience
and
discernment
to
distinguish
these
two
*NL*
kinds
of
gentlemen
,
so
much
alike
in
name
and
so
different
in
conduct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
me
!
''
said
the
niece
,
``
that
you
should
know
so
much
,
*NL*
uncle
--
enough
,
if
need
be
,
to
get
up
into
a
pulpit
and
go
preach
in
the
*NL*
streets
--
and
yet
that
you
should
fall
into
a
delusion
so
great
and
a
*NL*
folly
so
manifest
as
to
try
to
make
yourself
out
vigorous
when
you
are
*NL*
old
,
strong
when
you
are
sickly
,
able
to
put
straight
what
is
crooked
*NL*
when
you
yourself
are
bent
by
age
,
and
,
above
all
,
a
caballero
when
you
*NL*
are
not
one
;
for
though
gentlefolk
may
be
so
,
poor
men
are
nothing
of
the
*NL*
kind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
what
you
say
,
niece
,
''
returned
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
and
I
could
tell
you
somewhat
about
birth
that
would
astonish
*NL*
you
;
but
,
not
to
mix
up
things
human
and
divine
,
I
refrain
.
Look
you
,
my
*NL*
dears
,
all
the
lineages
in
the
world
-LRB-
attend
to
what
I
am
saying
-RRB-
can
be
*NL*
reduced
to
four
sorts
,
which
are
these
:
those
that
had
humble
beginnings
,
*NL*
and
went
on
spreading
and
extending
themselves
until
they
attained
*NL*
surpassing
greatness
;
those
that
had
great
beginnings
and
maintained
*NL*
them
,
and
still
maintain
and
uphold
the
greatness
of
their
origin
;
those
,
*NL*
again
,
that
from
a
great
beginning
have
ended
in
a
point
like
a
pyramid
,
*NL*
having
reduced
and
lessened
their
original
greatness
till
it
has
come
to
*NL*
nought
,
like
the
point
of
a
pyramid
,
which
,
relatively
to
its
base
or
*NL*
foundation
,
is
nothing
;
and
then
there
are
those
--
and
it
is
they
that
are
*NL*
the
most
numerous
--
that
have
had
neither
an
illustrious
beginning
nor
a
*NL*
remarkable
mid-course
,
and
so
will
have
an
end
without
a
name
,
like
an
*NL*
ordinary
plebeian
line
.
Of
the
first
,
those
that
had
an
humble
origin
and
*NL*
rose
to
the
greatness
they
still
preserve
,
the
Ottoman
house
may
serve
as
*NL*
an
example
,
which
from
an
humble
and
lowly
shepherd
,
its
founder
,
has
*NL*
reached
the
height
at
which
we
now
see
it
.
For
examples
of
the
second
*NL*
sort
of
lineage
,
that
began
with
greatness
and
maintains
it
still
without
*NL*
adding
to
it
,
there
are
the
many
princes
who
have
inherited
the
dignity
,
*NL*
and
maintain
themselves
in
their
inheritance
,
without
increasing
or
*NL*
diminishing
it
,
keeping
peacefully
within
the
limits
of
their
states
.
Of
*NL*
those
that
began
great
and
ended
in
a
point
,
there
are
thousands
of
*NL*
examples
,
for
all
the
Pharaohs
and
Ptolemies
of
Egypt
,
the
Caesars
of
*NL*
Rome
,
and
the
whole
herd
-LRB-
if
I
may
apply
such
a
word
to
them
-RRB-
of
countless
*NL*
princes
,
monarchs
,
lords
,
Medes
,
Assyrians
,
Persians
,
Greeks
,
and
*NL*
barbarians
,
all
these
lineages
and
lordships
have
ended
in
a
point
and
*NL*
come
to
nothing
,
they
themselves
as
well
as
their
founders
,
for
it
would
*NL*
be
impossible
now
to
find
one
of
their
descendants
,
and
,
even
should
we
*NL*
find
one
,
it
would
be
in
some
lowly
and
humble
condition
.
Of
plebeian
*NL*
lineages
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
save
that
they
merely
serve
to
swell
the
*NL*
number
of
those
that
live
,
without
any
eminence
to
entitle
them
to
any
*NL*
fame
or
praise
beyond
this
.
From
all
I
have
said
I
would
have
you
gather
,
*NL*
my
poor
innocents
,
that
great
is
the
confusion
among
lineages
,
and
that
*NL*
only
those
are
seen
to
be
great
and
illustrious
that
show
themselves
so
*NL*
by
the
virtue
,
wealth
,
and
generosity
of
their
possessors
.
I
have
said
*NL*
virtue
,
wealth
,
and
generosity
,
because
a
great
man
who
is
vicious
will
*NL*
be
a
great
example
of
vice
,
and
a
rich
man
who
is
not
generous
will
be
*NL*
merely
a
miserly
beggar
;
for
the
possessor
of
wealth
is
not
made
happy
by
*NL*
possessing
it
,
but
by
spending
it
,
and
not
by
spending
as
he
pleases
,
but
*NL*
by
knowing
how
to
spend
it
well
.
The
poor
gentleman
has
no
way
of
showing
*NL*
that
he
is
a
gentleman
but
by
virtue
,
by
being
affable
,
well-bred
,
*NL*
courteous
,
gentle-mannered
,
and
kindly
,
not
haughty
,
arrogant
,
or
*NL*
censorious
,
but
above
all
by
being
charitable
;
for
by
two
maravedis
given
*NL*
with
a
cheerful
heart
to
the
poor
,
he
will
show
himself
as
generous
as
he
*NL*
who
distributes
alms
with
bell-ringing
,
and
no
one
that
perceives
him
to
*NL*
be
endowed
with
the
virtues
I
have
named
,
even
though
he
know
him
not
,
*NL*
will
fail
to
recognise
and
set
him
down
as
one
of
good
blood
;
and
it
*NL*
would
be
strange
were
it
not
so
;
praise
has
ever
been
the
reward
of
*NL*
virtue
,
and
those
who
are
virtuous
can
not
fail
to
receive
commendation
.
*NL*
There
are
two
roads
,
my
daughters
,
by
which
men
may
reach
wealth
and
*NL*
honours
;
one
is
that
of
letters
,
the
other
that
of
arms
.
I
have
more
of
*NL*
arms
than
of
letters
in
my
composition
,
and
,
judging
by
my
inclination
to
*NL*
arms
,
was
born
under
the
influence
of
the
planet
Mars
.
I
am
,
therefore
,
*NL*
in
a
measure
constrained
to
follow
that
road
,
and
by
it
I
must
travel
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
the
world
,
and
it
will
be
labour
in
vain
for
you
to
urge
me
*NL*
to
resist
what
heaven
wills
,
fate
ordains
,
reason
requires
,
and
,
above
*NL*
all
,
my
own
inclination
favours
;
for
knowing
as
I
do
the
countless
toils
*NL*
that
are
the
accompaniments
of
knight-errantry
,
I
know
,
too
,
the
infinite
*NL*
blessings
that
are
attained
by
it
;
I
know
that
the
path
of
virtue
is
very
*NL*
narrow
,
and
the
road
of
vice
broad
and
spacious
;
I
know
their
ends
and
*NL*
goals
are
different
,
for
the
broad
and
easy
road
of
vice
ends
in
death
,
*NL*
and
the
narrow
and
toilsome
one
of
virtue
in
life
,
and
not
transitory
*NL*
life
,
but
in
that
which
has
no
end
;
I
know
,
as
our
great
Castilian
poet
*NL*
says
,
that
--
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
by
rugged
paths
like
these
they
go
*NL*
That
scale
the
heights
of
immortality
,
*NL*
Unreached
by
those
that
falter
here
below
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woe
is
me
!
''
exclaimed
the
niece
,
``
my
lord
is
a
poet
,
too
!
He
knows
*NL*
everything
,
and
he
can
do
everything
;
I
will
bet
,
if
he
chose
to
turn
*NL*
mason
,
he
could
make
a
house
as
easily
as
a
cage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
,
niece
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
these
chivalrous
*NL*
thoughts
did
not
engage
all
my
faculties
,
there
would
be
nothing
that
I
*NL*
could
not
do
,
nor
any
sort
of
knickknack
that
would
not
come
from
my
*NL*
hands
,
particularly
cages
and
tooth-picks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
door
,
and
when
they
asked
who
*NL*
was
there
,
Sancho
Panza
made
answer
that
it
was
he
.
The
instant
the
*NL*
housekeeper
knew
who
it
was
,
she
ran
to
hide
herself
so
as
not
to
see
*NL*
him
;
in
such
abhorrence
did
she
hold
him
.
The
niece
let
him
in
,
and
his
*NL*
master
Don
Quixote
came
forward
to
receive
him
with
open
arms
,
and
the
*NL*
pair
shut
themselves
up
in
his
room
,
where
they
had
another
conversation
*NL*
not
inferior
to
the
previous
one
.

CHAPTER
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
PASSED
BETWEEN
DON
QUIXOTE
AND
HIS
SQUIRE
,
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
*NL*
VERY
NOTABLE
INCIDENTS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
the
housekeeper
saw
Sancho
Panza
shut
himself
in
with
her
*NL*
master
,
she
guessed
what
they
were
about
;
and
suspecting
that
the
result
*NL*
of
the
consultation
would
be
a
resolve
to
undertake
a
third
sally
,
she
*NL*
seized
her
mantle
,
and
in
deep
anxiety
and
distress
,
ran
to
find
the
*NL*
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
,
as
she
thought
that
,
being
a
well-spoken
man
,
*NL*
and
a
new
friend
of
her
master
's
,
he
might
be
able
to
persuade
him
to
*NL*
give
up
any
such
crazy
notion
.
She
found
him
pacing
the
patio
of
his
*NL*
house
,
and
,
perspiring
and
flurried
,
she
fell
at
his
feet
the
moment
she
*NL*
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrasco
,
seeing
how
distressed
and
overcome
she
was
,
said
to
her
,
``
What
*NL*
is
this
,
mistress
housekeeper
?
What
has
happened
to
you
?
One
would
think
*NL*
you
heart-broken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
Senor
Samson
,
''
said
she
,
``
only
that
my
master
is
breaking
out
,
*NL*
plainly
breaking
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whereabouts
is
he
breaking
out
,
senora
?
''
asked
Samson
;
``
has
any
part
of
*NL*
his
body
burst
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
only
breaking
out
at
the
door
of
his
madness
,
''
she
replied
;
``
I
*NL*
mean
,
dear
senor
bachelor
,
that
he
is
going
to
break
out
again
-LRB-
and
this
*NL*
will
be
the
third
time
-RRB-
to
hunt
all
over
the
world
for
what
he
calls
*NL*
ventures
,
though
I
ca
n't
make
out
why
he
gives
them
that
name
.
The
first
*NL*
time
he
was
brought
back
to
us
slung
across
the
back
of
an
ass
,
and
*NL*
belaboured
all
over
;
and
the
second
time
he
came
in
an
ox-cart
,
shut
up
*NL*
in
a
cage
,
in
which
he
persuaded
himself
he
was
enchanted
,
and
the
poor
*NL*
creature
was
in
such
a
state
that
the
mother
that
bore
him
would
not
have
*NL*
known
him
;
lean
,
yellow
,
with
his
eyes
sunk
deep
in
the
cells
of
his
*NL*
skull
;
so
that
to
bring
him
round
again
,
ever
so
little
,
cost
me
more
*NL*
than
six
hundred
eggs
,
as
God
knows
,
and
all
the
world
,
and
my
hens
too
,
*NL*
that
wo
n't
let
me
tell
a
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
well
believe
,
''
replied
the
bachelor
,
``
for
they
are
so
good
*NL*
and
so
fat
,
and
so
well-bred
,
that
they
would
not
say
one
thing
for
*NL*
another
,
though
they
were
to
burst
for
it
.
In
short
then
,
mistress
*NL*
housekeeper
,
that
is
all
,
and
there
is
nothing
the
matter
,
except
what
it
*NL*
is
feared
Don
Quixote
may
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
senor
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
returned
the
bachelor
,
``
do
n't
be
uneasy
,
but
go
home
in
*NL*
peace
;
get
me
ready
something
hot
for
breakfast
,
and
while
you
are
on
the
*NL*
way
say
the
prayer
of
Santa
Apollonia
,
that
is
if
you
know
it
;
for
I
will
*NL*
come
presently
and
you
will
see
miracles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woe
is
me
,
''
cried
the
housekeeper
,
``
is
it
the
prayer
of
Santa
Apollonia
*NL*
you
would
have
me
say
?
That
would
do
if
it
was
the
toothache
my
master
*NL*
had
;
but
it
is
in
the
brains
,
what
he
has
got
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
I
am
saying
,
mistress
housekeeper
;
go
,
and
do
n't
set
*NL*
yourself
to
argue
with
me
,
for
you
know
I
am
a
bachelor
of
Salamanca
,
and
*NL*
one
ca
n't
be
more
of
a
bachelor
than
that
,
''
replied
Carrasco
;
and
with
*NL*
this
the
housekeeper
retired
,
and
the
bachelor
went
to
look
for
the
*NL*
curate
,
and
arrange
with
him
what
will
be
told
in
its
proper
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
were
shut
up
together
,
they
had
a
discussion
*NL*
which
the
history
records
with
great
precision
and
scrupulous
exactness
.
*NL*
Sancho
said
to
his
master
,
``
Senor
,
I
have
educed
my
wife
to
let
me
go
*NL*
with
your
worship
wherever
you
choose
to
take
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Induced
,
you
should
say
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
not
educed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
or
twice
,
as
well
as
I
remember
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
I
have
begged
of
*NL*
your
worship
not
to
mend
my
words
,
if
so
be
as
you
understand
what
I
mean
*NL*
by
them
;
and
if
you
do
n't
understand
them
to
say
`
Sancho
,
'
or
`
devil
,
'
'
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand
thee
;
and
if
I
do
n't
make
my
meaning
plain
,
then
you
may
*NL*
correct
me
,
for
I
am
so
focile
-
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
thee
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
once
;
``
for
I
know
*NL*
not
what
'
I
am
so
focile
'
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
So
focile
'
means
I
am
so
much
that
way
,
''
replied
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
thee
still
less
now
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
ca
n't
understand
me
,

said
Sancho
,
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
put
*NL*
it
;
I
know
no
more
,
God
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
now
I
have
hit
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
thou
wouldst
say
thou
art
so
*NL*
docile
,
tractable
,
and
gentle
that
thou
wilt
take
what
I
say
to
thee
,
and
*NL*
submit
to
what
I
teach
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
bet
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
from
the
very
first
you
understood
me
,
*NL*
and
knew
what
I
meant
,
but
you
wanted
to
put
me
out
that
you
might
hear
*NL*
me
make
another
couple
of
dozen
blunders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
be
so
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
to
come
to
the
point
,
what
does
*NL*
Teresa
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Teresa
says
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
that
I
should
make
sure
with
your
*NL*
worship
,
and
`
let
papers
speak
and
beards
be
still
,
'
for
`
he
who
binds
*NL*
does
not
wrangle
,
'
since
one
`
take
'
is
better
than
two
`
I
'll
give
*NL*
thee
's
;
'
and
I
say
a
woman
's
advice
is
no
great
thing
,
and
he
who
wo
n't
*NL*
take
it
is
a
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
say
I
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
continue
,
Sancho
my
friend
;
go
on
;
you
*NL*
talk
pearls
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
''
continued
Sancho
,
``
that
,
as
your
worship
knows
better
than
*NL*
I
do
,
we
are
all
of
us
liable
to
death
,
and
to-day
we
are
,
and
to-morrow
*NL*
we
are
not
,
and
the
lamb
goes
as
soon
as
the
sheep
,
and
nobody
can
*NL*
promise
himself
more
hours
of
life
in
this
world
than
God
may
be
pleased
*NL*
to
give
him
;
for
death
is
deaf
,
and
when
it
comes
to
knock
at
our
life
's
*NL*
door
,
it
is
always
urgent
,
and
neither
prayers
,
nor
struggles
,
nor
*NL*
sceptres
,
nor
mitres
,
can
keep
it
back
,
as
common
talk
and
report
say
,
*NL*
and
as
they
tell
us
from
the
pulpits
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
is
very
true
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
I
can
not
make
out
what
*NL*
thou
art
driving
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
am
driving
at
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
is
that
your
worship
settle
some
*NL*
fixed
wages
for
me
,
to
be
paid
monthly
while
I
am
in
your
service
,
and
*NL*
that
the
same
be
paid
me
out
of
your
estate
;
for
I
do
n't
care
to
stand
on
*NL*
rewards
which
either
come
late
,
or
ill
,
or
never
at
all
;
God
help
me
with
*NL*
my
own
.
In
short
,
I
would
like
to
know
what
I
am
to
get
,
be
it
much
or
*NL*
little
;
for
the
hen
will
lay
on
one
egg
,
and
many
littles
make
a
much
,
*NL*
and
so
long
as
one
gains
something
there
is
nothing
lost
.
To
be
sure
,
if
*NL*
it
should
happen
-LRB-
what
I
neither
believe

expect
-RRB-
that
your

*NL*
were
to
give
me
that
island
you
have
promised
me

I
am
not
so
ungrateful
*NL*

so
grasping

that
I
would
be
willing
to
have
the
revenue
of
such
*NL*
island
valued
and
stopped
out
of
my
wages
in
due
promotion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sancho
,
my
friend
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
sometimes
proportion
may
be
as
*NL*
good
as
promotion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
'll
bet
I
ought
to
have
said
proportion
,
and
not
*NL*
promotion
;
but
it
is
no
matter
,
as
your
worship
has
understood
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
well
understood
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
I
have
seen
into
*NL*
the
depths
of
thy
thoughts
,
and
know
the
mark
thou
art
shooting
at
with
*NL*
the
countless
shafts
of
thy
proverbs
.
Look
here
,
Sancho
,
I
would
readily
*NL*
fix
thy
wages
if
I
had
ever
found
any
instance
in
the
histories
of
the
*NL*
knights-errant
to
show
or
indicate
,
by
the
slightest
hint
,
what
their
*NL*
squires
used
to
get
monthly
or
yearly
;
but
I
have
read
all
or
the
best
*NL*
part
of
their
histories
,
and
I
can
not
remember
reading
of
any
*NL*
knight-errant
having
assigned
fixed
wages
to
his
squire
;
I
only
know
that
*NL*
they
all
served
on
reward
,
and
that
when
they
least
expected
it
,
if
good
*NL*
luck
attended
their
masters
,
they
found
themselves
recompensed
with
an
*NL*
island
or
something
equivalent
to
it
,
or
at
the
least
they
were
left
with
*NL*
a
title
and
lordship
.
If
with
these
hopes
and
additional
inducements
you
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
please
to
return
to
my
service
,
well
and
good
;
but
to
suppose
*NL*
that
I
am
going
to
disturb
or
unhinge
the
ancient
usage
of
*NL*
knight-errantry
,
is
all
nonsense
.
And
so
,
my
Sancho
,
get
you
back
to
your
*NL*
house
and
explain
my
intentions
to
your
Teresa
,
and
if
she
likes
and
you
*NL*
like
to
be
on
reward
with
me
,
bene
quidem
;
if
not
,
we
remain
friends
;
for
*NL*
if
the
pigeon-house
does
not
lack
food
,
it
will
not
lack
pigeons
;
and
*NL*
bear
in
mind
,
my
son
,
that
a
good
hope
is
better
than
a
bad
holding
,
and
*NL*
a
good
grievance
better
than
a
bad
compensation
.
I
speak
in
this
way
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
to
show
you
that
I
can
shower
down
proverbs
just
as
well
as
*NL*
yourself
;
and
in
short
,
I
mean
to
say
,
and
I
do
say
,
that
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
like
to
come
on
reward
with
me
,
and
run
the
same
chance
that
I
run
,
God
*NL*
be
with
you
and
make
a
saint
of
you
;
for
I
shall
find
plenty
of
squires
*NL*
more
obedient
and
painstaking
,
and
not
so
thickheaded
or
talkative
as
you
*NL*
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sancho
heard
his
master
's
firm
,
resolute
language
,
a
cloud
came
over
*NL*
the
sky
with
him
and
the
wings
of
his
heart
drooped
,
for
he
had
made
sure
*NL*
that
his
master
would
not
go
without
him
for
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
;
*NL*
and
as
he
stood
there
dumbfoundered
and
moody
,
Samson
Carrasco
came
in
*NL*
with
the
housekeeper
and
niece
,
who
were
anxious
to
hear
by
what
*NL*
arguments
he
was
about
to
dissuade
their
master
from
going
to
seek
*NL*
adventures
.
The
arch
wag
Samson
came
forward
,
and
embracing
him
as
he
had
*NL*
done
before
,
said
with
a
loud
voice
,
``
O
flower
of
knight-errantry
!
O
*NL*
shining
light
of
arms
!
O
honour
and
mirror
of
the
Spanish
nation
!
may
God
*NL*
Almighty
in
his
infinite
power
grant
that
any
person
or
persons
,
who
*NL*
would
impede
or
hinder
thy
third
sally
,
may
find
no
way
out
of
the
*NL*
labyrinth
of
their
schemes
,
nor
ever
accomplish
what
they
most
desire
!
''
*NL*
And
then
,
turning
to
the
housekeeper
,
he
said
,
``
Mistress
housekeeper
may
*NL*
just
as
well
give
over
saying
the
prayer
of
Santa
Apollonia
,
for
I
know
*NL*
it
is
the
positive
determination
of
the
spheres
that
Senor
Don
Quixote
*NL*
shall
proceed
to
put
into
execution
his
new
and
lofty
designs
;
and
I
*NL*
should
lay
a
heavy
burden
on
my
conscience
did
I
not
urge
and
persuade
*NL*
this
knight
not
to
keep
the
might
of
his
strong
arm
and
the
virtue
of
his
*NL*
valiant
spirit
any
longer
curbed
and
checked
,
for
by
his
inactivity
he
is
*NL*
defrauding
the
world
of
the
redress
of
wrongs
,
of
the
protection
of
*NL*
orphans
,
of
the
honour
of
virgins
,
of
the
aid
of
widows
,
and
of
the
*NL*
support
of
wives
,
and
other
matters
of
this
kind
appertaining
,
belonging
,
*NL*
proper
and
peculiar
to
the
order
of
knight-errantry
.
On
,
then
,
my
lord
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
beautiful
and
brave
,
let
your
worship
and
highness
set
out
*NL*
to-day
rather
than
to-morrow
;
and
if
anything
be
needed
for
the
execution
*NL*
of
your
purpose
,
here
am
I
ready
in
person
and
purse
to
supply
the
want
;
*NL*
and
were
it
requisite
to
attend
your
magnificence
as
squire
,
I
should
*NL*
esteem
it
the
happiest
good
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
,
Don
Quixote
,
turning
to
Sancho
,
said
,
``
Did
I
not
tell
thee
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
there
would
be
squires
enough
and
to
spare
for
me
?
See
now
who
*NL*
offers
to
become
one
;
no
less
than
the
illustrious
bachelor
Samson
*NL*
Carrasco
,
the
perpetual
joy
and
delight
of
the
courts
of
the
Salamancan
*NL*
schools
,
sound
in
body
,
discreet
,
patient
under
heat
or
cold
,
hunger
or
*NL*
thirst
,
with
all
the
qualifications
requisite
to
make
a
knight-errant
's
*NL*
squire
!
But
heaven
forbid
that
,
to
gratify
my
own
inclination
,
I
should
*NL*
shake
or
shatter
this
pillar
of
letters
and
vessel
of
the
sciences
,
and
*NL*
cut
down
this
towering
palm
of
the
fair
and
liberal
arts
.
Let
this
new
*NL*
Samson
remain
in
his
own
country
,
and
,
bringing
honour
to
it
,
bring
*NL*
honour
at
the
same
time
on
the
grey
heads
of
his
venerable
parents
;
for
I
*NL*
will
be
content
with
any
squire
that
comes
to
hand
,
as
Sancho
does
not
*NL*
deign
to
accompany
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
deign
,
''
said
Sancho
,
deeply
moved
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
;
``
it
*NL*
shall
not
be
said
of
me
,
master
mine
,
''
he
continued
,
''
`
the
bread
eaten
*NL*
and
the
company
dispersed
.
'
Nay
,
I
come
of
no
ungrateful
stock
,
for
all
*NL*
the
world
knows
,
but
particularly
my
own
town
,
who
the
Panzas
from
whom
I
*NL*
am
descended
were
;
and
,
what
is
more
,
I
know
and
have
learned
,
by
many
*NL*
good
words
and
deeds
,
your
worship
's
desire
to
show
me
favour
;
and
if
I
*NL*
have
been
bargaining
more
or
less
about
my
wages
,
it
was
only
to
please
*NL*
my
wife
,
who
,
when
she
sets
herself
to
press
a
point
,
no
hammer
drives
*NL*
the
hoops
of
a
cask
as
she
drives
one
to
do
what
she
wants
;
but
,
after
*NL*
all
,
a
man
must
be
a
man
,
and
a
woman
a
woman
;
and
as
I
am
a
man
anyhow
,
*NL*
which
I
ca
n't
deny
,
I
will
be
one
in
my
own
house
too
,
let
who
will
take
*NL*
it
amiss
;
and
so
there
's
nothing
more
to
do
but
for
your
worship
to
make
*NL*
your
will
with
its
codicil
in
such
a
way
that
it
ca
n't
be
provoked
,
and
*NL*
let
us
set
out
at
once
,
to
save
Senor
Samson
's
soul
from
suffering
,
as
he
*NL*
says
his
conscience
obliges
him
to
persuade
your
worship
to
sally
out
*NL*
upon
the
world
a
third
time
;
so
I
offer
again
to
serve
your
worship
*NL*
faithfully
and
loyally
,
as
well
and
better
than
all
the
squires
that
*NL*
served
knights-errant
in
times
past
or
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bachelor
was
filled
with
amazement
when
he
heard
Sancho
's
phraseology
*NL*
and
style
of
talk
,
for
though
he
had
read
the
first
part
of
his
master
's
*NL*
history
he
never
thought
that
he
could
be
so
droll
as
he
was
there
*NL*
described
;
but
now
,
hearing
him
talk
of
a
``
will
and
codicil
that
could
*NL*
not
be
provoked
,
''
instead
of
``
will
and
codicil
that
could
not
be
*NL*
revoked
,
''
he
believed
all
he
had
read
of
him
,
and
set
him
down
as
one
of
*NL*
the
greatest
simpletons
of
modern
times
;
and
he
said
to
himself
that
two
*NL*
such
lunatics
as
master
and
man
the
world
had
never
seen
.
In
fine
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
and
Sancho
embraced
one
another
and
made
friends
,
and
by
the
*NL*
advice
and
with
the
approval
of
the
great
Carrasco
,
who
was
now
their
*NL*
oracle
,
it
was
arranged
that
their
departure
should
take
place
three
days
*NL*
thence
,
by
which
time
they
could
have
all
that
was
requisite
for
the
*NL*
journey
ready
,
and
procure
a
closed
helmet
,
which
Don
Quixote
said
he
*NL*
must
by
all
means
take
.
Samson
offered
him
one
,
as
he
knew
a
friend
of
*NL*
his
who
had
it
would
not
refuse
it
to
him
,
though
it
was
more
dingy
with
*NL*
rust
and
mildew
than
bright
and
clean
like
burnished
steel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curses
which
both
housekeeper
and
niece
poured
out
on
the
bachelor
*NL*
were
past
counting
;
they
tore
their
hair
,
they
clawed
their
faces
,
and
in
*NL*
the
style
of
the
hired
mourners
that
were
once
in
fashion
,
they
raised
a
*NL*
lamentation
over
the
departure
of
their
master
and
uncle
,
as
if
it
had
*NL*
been
his
death
.
Samson
's
intention
in
persuading
him
to
sally
forth
once
*NL*
more
was
to
do
what
the
history
relates
farther
on
;
all
by
the
advice
of
*NL*
the
curate
and
barber
,
with
whom
he
had
previously
discussed
the
subject
.
*NL*
Finally
,
then
,
during
those
three
days
,
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
provided
*NL*
themselves
with
what
they
considered
necessary
,
and
Sancho
having
*NL*
pacified
his
wife
,
and
Don
Quixote
his
niece
and
housekeeper
,
at
*NL*
nightfall
,
unseen
by
anyone
except
the
bachelor
,
who
thought
fit
to
*NL*
accompany
them
half
a
league
out
of
the
village
,
they
set
out
for
El
*NL*
Toboso
,
Don
Quixote
on
his
good
Rocinante
and
Sancho
on
his
old
Dapple
,
*NL*
his
alforjas
furnished
with
certain
matters
in
the
way
of
victuals
,
and
*NL*
his
purse
with
money
that
Don
Quixote
gave
him
to
meet
emergencies
.
*NL*
Samson
embraced
him
,
and
entreated
him
to
let
him
hear
of
his
good
or
*NL*
evil
fortunes
,
so
that
he
might
rejoice
over
the
former
or
condole
with
*NL*
him
over
the
latter
,
as
the
laws
of
friendship
required
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
promised
him
he
would
do
so
,
and
Samson
returned
to
the
village
,
and
the
*NL*
other
two
took
the
road
for
the
great
city
of
El
Toboso

WHEREIN
IS
RELATED
WHAT

DON
QUIXOTE
ON
HIS
WAY
TO
SEE
HIS
LADY

DULCINEA
DEL
TOBOSO
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessed
be
Allah
the
all-powerful
!
''
says
Hamete
Benengeli
on
beginning
*NL*
this
eighth
chapter
;
``
blessed
be
Allah
!
''
he
repeats
three
times
;
and
he
*NL*
says
he
utters
these
thanksgivings
at
seeing
that
he
has
now
got
Don
*NL*
Quixote
and
Sancho
fairly
afield
,
and
that
the
readers
of
his
delightful
*NL*
history
may
reckon
that
the
achievements
and
humours
of
Don
Quixote
and
*NL*
his
squire
are
now
about
to
begin
;
and
he
urges
them
to
forget
the
former
*NL*
chivalries
of
the
ingenious
gentleman
and
to
fix
their
eyes
on
those
that
*NL*
are
to
come
,
which
now
begin
on
the
road
to
El
Toboso
,
as
the
others
*NL*
began
on
the
plains
of
Montiel
;
nor
is
it
much
that
he
asks
in
*NL*
consideration
of
all
he
promises
,
and
so
he
goes
on
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
were
left
alone
,
and
the
moment
Samson
took
his
*NL*
departure
,
Rocinante
began
to
neigh
,
and
Dapple
to
sigh
,
which
,
by
both
*NL*
knight
and
squire
,
was
accepted
as
a
good
sign
and
a
very
happy
omen
;
*NL*
though
,
if
the
truth
is
to
be
told
,
the
sighs
and
brays
of
Dapple
were
*NL*
louder
than
the
neighings
of
the
hack
,
from
which
Sancho
inferred
that
*NL*
his
good
fortune
was
to
exceed
and
overtop
that
of
his
master
,
building
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
upon
some
judicial
astrology
that
he
may
have
known
,
though
the
*NL*
history
says
nothing
about
it
;
all
that
can
be
said
is
,
that
when
he
*NL*
stumbled
or
fell
,
he
was
heard
to
say
he
wished
he
had
not
come
out
,
for
*NL*
by
stumbling
or
falling
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
but
a
damaged
shoe
or
*NL*
a
broken
rib
;
and
,
fool
as
he
was
,
he
was
not
much
astray
in
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Said
Don
Quixote
,
``
Sancho
,
my
friend
,
night
is
drawing
on
upon
us
as
we
*NL*
go
,
and
more
darkly
than
will
allow
us
to
reach
El
Toboso
by
daylight
;
*NL*
for
there
I
am
resolved
to
go
before
I
engage
in
another
adventure
,
and
*NL*
there
I
shall
obtain
the
blessing
and
generous
permission
of
the
peerless
*NL*
Dulcinea
,
with
which
permission
I
expect
and
feel
assured
that
I
shall
*NL*
conclude
and
bring
to
a
happy
termination
every
perilous
adventure
;
for
*NL*
nothing
in
life
makes
knights-errant
more
valorous
than
finding
*NL*
themselves
favoured
by
their
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
believe
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
but
I
think
it
will
be
difficult
for
*NL*
your
worship
to
speak
with
her
or
see
her
,
at
any
rate
where
you
will
be
*NL*
able
to
receive
her
blessing
;
unless
,
indeed
,
she
throws
it
over
the
wall
*NL*
of
the
yard
where
I
saw
her
the
time
before
,
when
I
took
her
the
letter
*NL*
that
told
of
the
follies
and
mad
things
your
worship
was
doing
in
the
*NL*
heart

where

*NL*
``
It

for

so
that

I
see
her

it

the

to

at
a

through

for
any
*NL*
beam
of
the
sun
of
her
beauty
that
reaches
my
eyes

give
light
to
my
*NL*
reason

*NL*
``
Well
,
to
tell
the

said
Sancho
,
``
when
I
saw
that
sun

the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso

it
was
not
bright
enough
to
throw
out
beams
*NL*
at
all
;
it
must
have
been
,
that
as
her
grace
was
sifting
that
wheat
I
*NL*
told
you
of
,
the
thick
dust
she
raised
came
before
her
face
like
a
cloud

dimmed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
dost
thou
still
persist
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
in
saying
,
*NL*
thinking
,
believing
,
and
maintaining
that
my
lady
Dulcinea
was
sifting
*NL*
wheat
,
that
being
an
occupation
and
task
entirely
at
variance
with
what
*NL*
is
and
should
be
the
employment
of
persons
of
distinction
,
who
are
*NL*
constituted
and
reserved
for
other
avocations
and
pursuits
that
show
*NL*
their
rank
a
bowshot
off
?
Thou
hast
forgotten
,
O
Sancho
,
those
lines
of
*NL*
our
poet
wherein
he
paints
for
us
how
,
in
their
crystal
abodes
,
those
*NL*
four
nymphs
employed
themselves
who
rose
from
their
loved
Tagus
and
*NL*
seated
themselves
in
a
verdant
meadow
to
embroider
those
tissues
which
*NL*
the
ingenious
poet
there
describes
to
us
,
how
they
were
worked
and
woven
*NL*
with
gold
and
silk
and
pearls
;
and
something
of
this
sort
must
have
been
*NL*
the
employment
of
my
lady
when
thou
sawest
her
,
only
that
the
spite
which
*NL*
some
wicked
enchanter
seems
to
have
against
everything
of
mine
changes
*NL*
all
those
things
that
give
me
pleasure
,
and
turns
them
into
shapes
unlike
*NL*
their
own
;
and
so
I
fear
that
in
that
history
of
my
achievements
which
*NL*
they
say
is
now
in
print
,
if
haply
its
author
was
some
sage
who
is
an
*NL*
enemy
of
mine
,
he
will
have
put
one
thing
for
another
,
mingling
a
*NL*
thousand
lies
with
one
truth
,
and
amusing
himself
by
relating
*NL*
transactions
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
sequence
of
a
true
*NL*
history
.
O
envy
,
root
of
all
countless
evils
,
and
cankerworm
of
the
*NL*
virtues
!
All
the
vices
,
Sancho
,
bring
some
kind
of
pleasure
with
them
;
*NL*
but
envy
brings
nothing
but
irritation
,
bitterness
,
and
rage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
say
too
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
and
I
suspect
in
that
legend
or
history
*NL*
of
us
that
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
told
us
he
saw
,
my
honour
goes
*NL*
dragged
in
the
dirt
,
knocked
about
,
up
and
down
,
sweeping
the
streets
,
as
*NL*
they
say
.
And
yet
,
on
the
faith
of
an
honest
man
,
I
never
spoke
ill
of
*NL*
any
enchanter
,
and
I
am
not
so
well
off
that
I
am
to
be
envied
;
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
I
am
rather
sly
,
and
I
have
a
certain
spice
of
the
rogue
in
me
;
but
*NL*
all
is
covered
by
the
great
cloak
of
my
simplicity
,
always
natural
and
*NL*
never
acted
;
and
if
I
had
no
other
merit
save
that
I
believe
,
as
I
always
*NL*
do
,
firmly
and
truly
in
God
,
and
all
the
holy
Roman
Catholic
Church
holds
*NL*
and
believes
,
and
that
I
am
a
mortal
enemy
of
the
Jews
,
the
historians
*NL*
ought
to
have
mercy
on
me
and
treat
me
well
in
their
writings
.
But
let
*NL*
them
say
what
they
like
;
naked
was
I
born
,
naked
I
find
myself
,
I
neither
*NL*
lose
nor
gain
;
nay
,
while
I
see
myself
put
into
a
book
and
passed
on
from
*NL*
hand
to
hand
over
the
world
,
I
do
n't
care
a
fig
,
let
them
say
what
they
*NL*
like
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
Sancho
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
reminds
me
of
what
happened
to
a
*NL*
famous
poet
of
our
own
day
,
who
,
having
written
a
bitter
satire
against
*NL*
all
the
courtesan
ladies
,
did
not
insert
or
name
in
it
a
certain
lady
of
*NL*
whom
it
was
questionable
whether
she
was
one
or
not
.
She
,
seeing
she
was
*NL*
not
in
the
list
of
the
poet
,
asked
him
what
he
had
seen
in
her
that
he
*NL*
did
not
include
her
in
the
number
of
the
others
,
telling
him
he
must
add
*NL*
to
his
satire
and
put
her
in
the
new
part
,
or
else
look
out
for
the
*NL*
consequences
.
The
poet
did
as
she
bade
him
,
and
left
her
without
a
shred
*NL*
of
reputation
,
and
she
was
satisfied
by
getting
fame
though
it
was
*NL*
infamy
.
In
keeping
with
this
is
what
they
relate
of
that
shepherd
who
set
*NL*
fire
to
the
famous
temple
of
Diana
,
by
repute
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
*NL*
the
world
,
and
burned
it
with
the
sole
object
of
making
his
name
live
in
*NL*
after
ages
;
and
,
though
it
was
forbidden
to
name
him
,
or
mention
his
name
*NL*
by
word
of
mouth
or
in
writing
,
lest
the
object
of
his
ambition
should
be
*NL*
attained
,
nevertheless
it
became
known
that
he
was
called
Erostratus
.
And
*NL*
something
of
the
same
sort
is
what
happened
in
the
case
of
the
great
*NL*
emperor
Charles
V
and
a
gentleman
in
Rome
.
The
emperor
was
anxious
to
see
*NL*
that
famous
temple
of
the
Rotunda
,
called
in
ancient
times
the
temple
`
of
*NL*
all
the
gods
,
'
but
now-a-days
,
by
a
better
nomenclature
,
`
of
all
the
*NL*
saints
,
'
which
is
the
best
preserved
building
of
all
those
of
pagan
*NL*
construction
in
Rome
,
and
the
one
which
best
sustains
the
reputation
of
*NL*
mighty
works
and
magnificence
of
its
founders
.
It
is
in
the
form
of
a
*NL*
half
orange
,
of
enormous
dimensions
,
and
well
lighted
,
though
no
light
*NL*
penetrates
it
save
that
which
is
admitted
by
a
window
,
or
rather
round
*NL*
skylight
,
at
the
top
;
and
it
was
from
this
that
the
emperor
examined
the
*NL*
building
.
A
Roman
gentleman
stood
by
his
side
and
explained
to
him
the
*NL*
skilful
construction
and
ingenuity
of
the
vast
fabric
and
its
wonderful
*NL*
architecture
,
and
when
they
had
left
the
skylight
he
said
to
the
emperor
,
*NL*
'
A
thousand
times
,
your
Sacred
Majesty
,
the
impulse
came
upon
me
to
seize
*NL*
your
Majesty
in
my
arms
and
fling
myself
down
from
yonder
skylight
,
so
as
*NL*
to
leave
behind
me
in
the
world
a
name
that
would
last
for
ever
.
'
'
I
am
*NL*
thankful
to
you
for
not
carrying
such
an
evil
thought
into
effect
,
'
said
*NL*
the
emperor
,
`
and
I
shall
give
you
no
opportunity
in
future
of
again
*NL*
putting
your
loyalty
to
the
test
;
and
I
therefore
forbid
you
ever
to
*NL*
speak
to
me
or
to
be
where
I
am
;
and
he
followed
up
these
words
by
*NL*
bestowing
a
liberal
bounty
upon
him
.
My
meaning
is
,
Sancho
,
that
the
*NL*
desire
of
acquiring
fame
is
a
very
powerful
motive
.
What
,
thinkest
thou
,
*NL*
was
it
that
flung
Horatius
in
full
armour
down
from
the
bridge
into
the
*NL*
depths
of
the
Tiber
?
What
burned
the
hand
and
arm
of
Mutius
?
What
*NL*
impelled
Curtius
to
plunge
into
the
deep
burning
gulf
that
opened
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
Rome
?
What
,
in
opposition
to
all
the
omens
that
declared
against
*NL*
him
,
made
Julius
Caesar
cross
the
Rubicon
?
And
to
come
to
more
modern
*NL*
examples
,
what
scuttled
the
ships
,
and
left
stranded
and
cut
off
the
*NL*
gallant
Spaniards
under
the
command
of
the
most
courteous
Cortes
in
the
*NL*
New
World
?
All
these
and
a
variety
of
other
great
exploits
are
,
were
and
*NL*
will
be
,
the
work
of
fame
that
mortals
desire
as
a
reward
and
a
portion
*NL*
of
the
immortality
their
famous
deeds
deserve
;
though
we
Catholic
*NL*
Christians
and
knights-errant
look
more
to
that
future
glory
that
is
*NL*
everlasting
in
the
ethereal
regions
of
heaven
than
to
the
vanity
of
the
*NL*
fame
that
is
to
be
acquired
in
this
present
transitory
life
;
a
fame
that
,
*NL*
however
long
it
may
last
,
must
after
all
end
with
the
world
itself
,
which
*NL*
has
its
own
appointed
end
.
So
that
,
O
Sancho
,
in
what
we
do
we
must
not
*NL*
overpass
the
bounds
which
the
Christian
religion
we
profess
has
assigned
*NL*
to
us
.
We
have
to
slay
pride
in
giants
,
envy
by
generosity
and
nobleness
*NL*
of
heart
,
anger
by
calmness
of
demeanour
and
equanimity
,
gluttony
and
*NL*
sloth
by
the
spareness
of
our
diet
and
the
length
of
our
vigils
,
lust
and
*NL*
lewdness
by
the
loyalty
we
preserve
to
those
whom
we
have
made
the
*NL*
mistresses
of
our
thoughts
,
indolence
by
traversing
the
world
in
all
*NL*
directions
seeking
opportunities
of
making
ourselves
,
besides
Christians
,
*NL*
famous
knights
.
Such
,
Sancho
,
are
the
means
by
which
we
reach
those
*NL*
extremes
of
praise
that
fair
fame
carries
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
your
worship
has
said
so
far
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
have
understood
*NL*
quite
well
;
but
still
I
would
be
glad
if
your
worship
would
dissolve
a
*NL*
doubt
for
me
,
which
has
just
this
minute
come
into
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Solve

thou
meanest

Sancho

said
Don
Quixote
;
``

on

I
will
answer
as
well
as
I
can

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me

''
Sancho
went
on
to
say
,
``

Julys

Augusts

those
venturous

now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
heathens

replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
are

no
doubt

in

good
Christians

either
in
purgatory
or
in

heaven

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
now
I
want
to
know
--
the
tombs

the
*NL*
bodies
of
those
great
lords
are

have
they
silver
lamps
before
them

are
the

of
their
chapels
ornamented
with
crutches
,
winding-sheets
,
*NL*
tresses
of
hair
,
legs
and
eyes
in
wax
?
Or
what
are
they
ornamented
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
made
answer
:
``
The
tombs
of
the
heathens
were
*NL*
generally
sumptuous
temples
;
the
ashes
of
Julius
Caesar
's
body
were
*NL*
placed
on
the
top
of
a
stone
pyramid
of
vast
size
,
which
they
now
call
in
*NL*
Rome
Saint
Peter
's
needle
.
The
emperor
Hadrian
had
for
a
tomb
a
castle
as
*NL*
large
as
a
good-sized
village
,
which
they
called
the
Moles
Adriani
,
and
*NL*
is
now
the
castle
of
St.
Angelo
in
Rome
.
The
queen
Artemisia
buried
her
*NL*
husband
Mausolus
in
a
tomb
which
was
reckoned
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
*NL*
the
world
;
but
none
of
these
tombs
,
or
of
the
many
others
of
the
*NL*
heathens
,
were
ornamented
with
winding-sheets
or
any
of
those
other
*NL*
offerings
and
tokens
that
show
that
they
who
are
buried
there
are
*NL*
saints

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
point
I
'm
coming

Sancho
;

now

me

is

the
greater

bring

kill
a
giant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
answer
is
easy

replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
it
is
a
greater
work

*NL*
*NL*

a
better

than

all

*NL*
``
That
I

,
and
we
*NL*
shall
obtain
more
quickly
the
fair
fame
we
are
striving
after
;
for
you
*NL*
know
,
senor
,
yesterday
or
the
day
before
yesterday
-LRB-
for
it
is
so
lately
*NL*
one
may
say
so
-RRB-
they
canonised
and
beatified
two
little
barefoot
friars
,
*NL*
and
it
is
now
reckoned
the
greatest
good
luck
to
kiss
or
touch
the
iron
*NL*
chains
with
which
they
girt
and
tortured
their
bodies
,
and
they
are
held
*NL*
in
greater
veneration
,
so
it
is
said
,
than
the
sword
of
Roland
in
the
*NL*
armoury
of
our
lord
the
King
,
whom
God
preserve
.
So
that
,
senor
,
it
is
*NL*
better
to
be
an
humble
little
friar
of
no
matter
what
order
,
than
a
*NL*
valiant
knight-errant
;
with
God
a
couple
of
dozen
of
penance
lashings
are
*NL*
of
more
avail
than
two
thousand
lance-thrusts
,
be
they
given
to
giants
,
*NL*
or
monsters
,
or
dragons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
is
true
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
we
can
not
all
be
friars
,
*NL*
and
many
are
the
ways
by
which
God
takes
his
own
to
heaven
;
chivalry
is
a
*NL*
religion
,
there
are
sainted
knights
in
glory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
I
have
heard
say
that
there
are
more
friars
in
*NL*
heaven
than
knights-errant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
is
because
those
in
religious
orders
are
more
*NL*
numerous
than
knights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
errants
are
many
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
few
they
who
deserve
the
name
of
*NL*
knights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
,
and
other
discussions
of
the
same
sort
,
they
passed
that
*NL*
night
and
the
following
day
,
without
anything
worth
mention
happening
to
*NL*
them
,
whereat
Don
Quixote
was
not
a
little
dejected
;
but
at
length
the
*NL*
next
day
,
at
daybreak
,
they
descried
the
great
city
of
El
Toboso
,
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
which
Don
Quixote
's
spirits
rose
and
Sancho
's
fell
,
for
he
did
*NL*
not
know
Dulcinea
's
house
,
nor
in
all
his
life
had
he
ever
seen
her
,
any
*NL*
more
than
his
master
;
so
that
they
were
both
uneasy
,
the
one
to
see
her
,
*NL*
the
other
at
not
having
seen
her
,
and
Sancho
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
*NL*
he
was
to
do
when
his
master
sent
him
to
El
Toboso
.
In
the
end
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
made
up
his
mind
to
enter
the
city
at
nightfall
,
and
they
waited
*NL*
until
the
time
came
among
some
oak
trees
that
were
near
El
Toboso
;
and
*NL*
when
the
moment
they
had
agreed
upon
arrived
,
they
made
their
entrance
*NL*
into
the
city
,
where
something
happened
them
that
may
fairly
be
called
*NL*
something
.

CHAPTER
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
RELATED
WHAT
WILL
BE
SEEN
THERE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
at
the
very
midnight
hour
--
more
or
less
--
when
Don
Quixote
and
*NL*
Sancho
quitted
the
wood
and
entered
El
Toboso
.
The
town
was
in
deep
*NL*
silence
,
for
all
the
inhabitants
were
asleep
,
and
stretched
on
the
broad
*NL*
of
their
backs
,
as
the
saying
is
.
The
night
was
darkish
,
though
Sancho
*NL*
would
have
been
glad
had
it
been
quite
dark
,
so
as
to
find
in
the
*NL*
darkness
an
excuse
for
his
blundering
.
All
over
the
place
nothing
was
to
*NL*
be
heard
except
the
barking
of
dogs
,
which
deafened
the
ears
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
and
troubled
the
heart
of
Sancho
.
Now
and
then
an
ass
brayed
,
*NL*
pigs
grunted
,
cats
mewed
,
and
the
various
noises
they
made
seemed
louder
*NL*
in
the
silence
of
the
night
;
all
which
the
enamoured
knight
took
to
be
of
*NL*
evil
omen
;
nevertheless
he
said
to
Sancho
,
``
Sancho
,
my
son
,
lead
on
to
*NL*
the
palace
of
Dulcinea
,
it
may
be
that
we
shall
find
her
awake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Body
of
the
sun
!
what
palace
am
I
to
lead
to
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
when
what
I
*NL*
saw
her
highness
in
was
only
a
very
little
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
likely
she
had
then
withdrawn
into
some
small
apartment
of
her
*NL*
palace
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
to
amuse
herself
with
damsels
,
as
great
*NL*
ladies
and
princesses
are
accustomed
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
if
your
worship
will
have
it
in
spite
of
me
that
*NL*
the
house
of
my
lady
Dulcinea
is
a
palace
,
is
this
an
hour
,
think
you
,
to
*NL*
find
the
door
open
;
and
will
it
be
right
for
us
to
go
knocking
till
they
*NL*
hear
us
and
open
the
door
;
making
a
disturbance
and
confusion
all
through
*NL*
the
household
?
Are
we
going
,
do
you
fancy
,
to
the
house
of
our
wenches
,
*NL*
like
gallants
who
come
and
knock
and
go
in
at
any
hour
,
however
late
it
*NL*
may
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
first
of
all
find
out
the
palace
for
certain
,
''
replied
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
and
then
I
will
tell
thee
,
Sancho
,
what
we
had
best
do
;
but
*NL*
look
,
Sancho
,
for
either
I
see
badly
,
or
that
dark
mass
that
one
sees
*NL*
from
here
should
be
Dulcinea
's
palace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
your
worship
lead
the
way
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
perhaps
it
may
be
so
;
*NL*
though
I
see
it
with
my
eyes
and
touch
it
with
my
hands
,
I
'll
believe
it
*NL*
as
much
as
I
believe
it
is
daylight
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
took
the
lead
,
and
having
gone
a
matter
of
two
hundred
paces
*NL*
he
came
upon
the
mass
that
produced
the
shade
,
and
found
it
was
a
great
*NL*
tower
,
and
then
he
perceived
that
the
building
in
question
was
no
palace
,
*NL*
but
the
chief
church
of
the
town
,
and
said
he
,
``
It
's
the
church
we
have
*NL*
lit
upon
,
Sancho
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
see
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
God
grant
we
may
not
light
upon
our
graves
;
*NL*
it
is
no
good
sign
to
find
oneself
wandering
in
a
graveyard
at
this
time
*NL*
of
night
;
and
that
,
after
my
telling
your
worship
,
if
I
do
n't
mistake
,
*NL*
that
the
house
of
this
lady
will
be
in
an
alley
without
an
outlet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
curse
of
God
on
thee
for
a
blockhead
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
where
hast
*NL*
thou
ever
heard
of
castles
and
royal
palaces
being
built
in
alleys
*NL*
without
an
outlet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
every
country
has
a
way
of
its
own
;
perhaps
*NL*
here
in
El
Toboso
it
is
the
way
to
build
palaces
and
grand
buildings
in
*NL*
alleys
;
so
I
entreat
your
worship
to
let
me
search
about
among
these
*NL*
streets
or
alleys
before
me
,
and
perhaps
,
in
some
corner
or
other
,
I
may
*NL*
stumble
on
this
palace
--
and
I
wish
I
saw
the
dogs
eating
it
for
leading
*NL*
us
such
a
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
respectfully
of
what
belongs
to
my
lady

Sancho

''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
``
let
us
keep
the
feast
in
peace
,
and
not
throw
the
rope
after
*NL*
the
bucket
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
hold
my
tongue

said
Sancho
,
``

how
am
I
to
take
it
patiently
*NL*
when
your

wants
me

with
only
once
seeing

house
of
our
*NL*
mistress

to
know
always
,

find
it
in
the
middle
of
the
night

find

it
thousands

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
wilt
drive
me
to
desperation

Sancho

said
Don
Quixote
.
``
Look

here

heretic
,
have
I
not
told
thee
a
thousand
times
that
I
have
never
*NL*
once
in
my
life
seen
the
peerless
Dulcinea
or
crossed
the
threshold
of
*NL*
her
palace
,
and
that
I
am
enamoured
solely
by
hearsay
and
by
the
great
*NL*
reputation
she
bears
for
beauty
and
discretion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
it
now
,
''
returned
Sancho
;
``
and
I
may
tell
you
that
if
you
have
*NL*
not
seen
her
,
no
more
have
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
can
not
be
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
,
at
any
rate
,
thou
saidst

on
*NL*
bringing
back
the
answer
to
the
letter
I
sent
by
thee
,
that
thou
sawest
*NL*
her
sifting
wheat
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
that
,
senor
,

said
Sancho
;
``
I
must
tell
you
that
my
seeing
*NL*
her
and
the
answer
I
brought
you
back
were
by
hearsay
too
,
for
I
can
no
*NL*
more
tell
who
the
lady
Dulcinea
is
than
I
can
hit
the
sky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sancho
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
there
are
times
for
jests
and
times
*NL*
when
jests
are
out
of
place

if
I
tell
thee
that
I
have
neither
seen
nor
*NL*
spoken
to
the
lady
of
my
heart
,
it
is
no
reason
why
thou
shouldst
say
*NL*
thou
hast
not
spoken
to
her
or
seen
her

when
the
contrary
is
the
case

*NL*
as
thou
well
knowest

''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
two
were
engaged
in
this
conversation
,
they
perceived
some
one
*NL*
with
a
pair
of
mules
approaching
the
spot
where
they
stood
,
and
from
the
*NL*
noise
the
plough
made
,
as
it
dragged
along
the
ground
,
they
guessed
him
*NL*
to
be
some
labourer
who
had
got
up
before
daybreak
to
go
to
his
work
,
and
*NL*
so
it
proved
to
be
.
He
came
along
singing
the
ballad
that
says
--
*NL*
*NL*
Ill
did
ye
fare
,
ye
men
of
France
,
In
Roncesvalles
chase
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
die
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
when
he
heard
him
,
``
if
any
good
*NL*
will
come
to
us
tonight
!
Dost
thou
not
hear
what
that
clown
is
singing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
what
has
Roncesvalles
chase
to
do
with
what
we
*NL*
have
in
hand

He
might
just
as
well
be
singing
the
ballad
of
Calainos
,
*NL*
for
any
good
or
ill
that
can
come
to
us
in
our
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
labourer
had
come
up
,
and
Don
Quixote
asked
him
,
``
Can
*NL*
you
tell
me
,
worthy
friend
,
and
God
speed
you
,
whereabouts
here
is
the

palace
of
the
peerless
princess
Dona
Dulcinea
del
Toboso

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
lad

``
I
am
a
stranger

I
have
been
only
a
few

days
in

work
for
a
rich
farmer

In
that
house
*NL*
opposite
there
live
the
curate

the
village

the
sacristan
,

both
*NL*
or
either
of
them
will
be
able
to
give
your
worship
some
account
of
this

lady
princess

for
they
have
a
list
of
all
the
people
of
El
Toboso
;
*NL*
though
it
is
my
belief
there
is
not
a
princess
living
in
the
whole
of
it
;
*NL*
many
ladies
there
are

of
quality

in
her
own
house

may

be
a
princess

*NL*
``
Well

replied
the

comes
the

daylight

without
waiting
for
any
more
of
his
questions
,
he
whipped
*NL*
on
his
mules
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
seeing
his
master
downcast
and
somewhat
dissatisfied
,
said
to
*NL*
him
,
``
Senor

daylight
will
be
here
before
long

it
will
not
do
for

sun
find
us
in
the
street
;
it
will
be
better
for
us
to
quit
*NL*
the
city
,
and
for
your
worship
to
hide
in
some
forest
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood

I
will
come
back
in
the
daytime

I
wo

hard
luck
for

as
soon
as
I
have
found
it
I
will
speak

any
damage

her
honour

reputation

*NL*
``
Sancho

said
Don
Quixote
,
``
thou
hast
delivered
a
thousand
sentences

condensed
in

*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
in
a
fever
to
get
his
master
out
of
the
town
,
lest
he
should
*NL*
discover
the
falsehood
of
the
reply
he
had
brought
to
him
in
the
Sierra
*NL*
Morena
on
behalf
of
Dulcinea
;
so
he
hastened
their
departure
,
which
they
*NL*
took
at
once
,
and
two
miles
out
of
the
village
they
found
a
forest
or
*NL*
thicket
wherein
Don
Quixote
ensconced
himself
,
while
Sancho
returned
to
*NL*
the
city
to
speak
to
Dulcinea
,
in
which
embassy
things
befell
him
which
*NL*
demand
fresh

CHAPTER
X.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
RELATED
THE
CRAFTY
DEVICE
SANCHO
ADOPTED
TO
ENCHANT
THE
LADY
*NL*
DULCINEA
,
AND
OTHER
INCIDENTS
AS
LUDICROUS
AS
THEY
ARE
TRUE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
author
of
this
great
history
comes
to
relate
what
is
set
down
in
*NL*
this
chapter
he
says
he
would
have
preferred
to
pass
it
over
in
silence
,
*NL*
fearing
it
would
not
be
believed
,
because
here
Don
Quixote
's
madness
*NL*
reaches
the
confines
of
the
greatest
that
can
be
conceived
,
and
even
goes
*NL*
a
couple
of
bowshots
beyond
the
greatest
.
But
after
all
,
though
still
*NL*
under
the
same
fear
and
apprehension
,
he
has
recorded
it
without
adding
*NL*
to
the
story
or
leaving
out
a
particle
of
the
truth
,
and
entirely
*NL*
disregarding
the
charges
of
falsehood
that
might
be
brought
against
him
;
*NL*
and
he
was
right
,
for
the
truth
may
run
fine
but
will
not
break
,
and
*NL*
always
rises
above
falsehood
as
oil
above
water
;
and
so
,
going
on
with
*NL*
his
story
,
he
says
that
as
soon
as
Don
Quixote
had
ensconced
himself
in
*NL*
the
forest
,
oak
grove
,
or
wood
near
El
Toboso
,
he
bade
Sancho
return
to
*NL*
the
city
,
and
not
come
into
his
presence
again
without
having
first
*NL*
spoken
on
his
behalf
to
his
lady
,
and
begged
of
her
that
it
might
be
her
*NL*
good
pleasure
to
permit
herself
to
be
seen
by
her
enslaved
knight
,
and
*NL*
deign
to
bestow
her
blessing
upon
him
,
so
that
he
might
thereby
hope
for
*NL*
a
happy
issue
in
all
his
encounters
and
difficult
enterprises
.
Sancho
*NL*
undertook
to
execute
the
task
according
to
the
instructions
,
and
to
bring
*NL*
back
an
answer
as
good
as
the
one
he
brought
back
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
my
son
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
be
not
dazed
when
thou
findest
*NL*
thyself
exposed
to
the
light
of
that
sun
of
beauty
thou
art
going
to
*NL*
seek
.
Happy
thou
,
above
all
the
squires
in
the
world
!
Bear
in
mind
,
and
*NL*
let
it
not
escape
thy
memory
,
how
she
receives
thee
;
if
she
changes
*NL*
colour
while
thou
art
giving
her
my
message
;
if
she
is
agitated
and
*NL*
disturbed
at
hearing
my
name
;
if
she
can
not
rest
upon
her
cushion
,
*NL*
shouldst
thou
haply
find
her
seated
in
the
sumptuous
state
chamber
proper
*NL*
to
her
rank
;
and
should
she
be
standing
,
observe
if
she
poises
herself
*NL*
now
on
one
foot
,
now
on
the
other
;
if
she
repeats
two
or
three
times
the
*NL*
reply
she
gives
thee
;
if
she
passes
from
gentleness
to
austerity
,
from
*NL*
asperity
to
tenderness
;
if
she
raises
her
hand
to
smooth
her
hair
though
*NL*
it
be
not
disarranged
.
In
short
,
my
son
,
observe
all
her
actions
and
*NL*
motions
,
for
if
thou
wilt
report
them
to
me
as
they
were
,
I
will
gather
*NL*
what
she
hides
in
the
recesses
of
her
heart
as
regards
my
love
;
for
I
*NL*
would
have
thee
know
,
Sancho
,
if
thou
knowest
it
not
,
that
with
lovers
*NL*
the
outward
actions
and
motions
they
give
way
to
when
their
loves
are
in
*NL*
question
are
the
faithful
messengers
that
carry
the
news
of
what
is
going
*NL*
on
in
the
depths
of
their
hearts
.
Go
,
my
friend
,
may
better
fortune
than
*NL*
mine
attend
thee
,
and
bring
thee
a
happier
issue
than
that
which
I
await
*NL*
in
dread
in
this
dreary
solitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
and
return
quickly
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
cheer
up
that
little
heart
*NL*
of
yours
,
master
mine
,
for
at
the
present
moment
you
seem
to
have
got
one
*NL*
no
bigger
than
a
hazel
nut
;
remember
what
they
say
,
that
a
stout
heart
*NL*
breaks
bad
luck
,
and
that
where
there
are
no
fletches
there
are
no
pegs
;
*NL*
and
moreover
they
say
,
the
hare
jumps
up
where
it
's
not
looked
for
.
I
say
*NL*
this
because
,
if
we
could
not
find
my
lady
's
palaces
or
castles
to-night
,
*NL*
now
that
it
is
daylight
I
count
upon
finding
them
when
I
least
expect
it
,
*NL*
and
once
found
,
leave
it
to
me
to
manage
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Verily
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
thou
dost
always
bring
in
thy
*NL*
proverbs
happily
,
whatever
we
deal
with
;
may
God
give
me
better
luck
in
*NL*
what
I
am
anxious
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
,
Sancho
wheeled
about
and
gave
Dapple
the
stick
,
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
remained
behind
,
seated
on
his
horse
,
resting
in
his
stirrups
and
*NL*
leaning
on
the
end
of
his
lance
,
filled
with
sad
and
troubled
*NL*
forebodings
;
and
there
we
will
leave
him
,
and
accompany
Sancho
,
who
went
*NL*
off
no
less
serious
and
troubled
than
he
left
his
master
;
so
much
so
,
*NL*
that
as
soon
as
he
had
got
out
of
the
thicket
,
and
looking
round
saw
that
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
not
within
sight
,
he
dismounted
from
his
ass
,
and
seating
*NL*
himself
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
began
to
commune
with
himself
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
Now
,
brother
Sancho
,
let
us
know
where
your
worship
is
going
.
Are
you
*NL*
going
to
look
for
some
ass
that
has
been
lost
?
Not
at
all
.
Then
what
are
*NL*
you
going
to
look
for
?
I
am
going
to
look
for
a
princess
,
that
's
all
;
and
*NL*
in
her
for
the
sun
of
beauty
and
the
whole
heaven
at
once
.
And
where
do
*NL*
you
expect
to
find
all
this
,
Sancho
?
Where
?
Why
,
in
the
great
city
of
El
*NL*
Toboso
.
Well
,
and
for
whom
are
you
going
to
look
for
her
?
For
the
famous
*NL*
knight
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
who
rights
wrongs
,
gives
food
to
those
*NL*
who
thirst
and
drink
to
the
hungry
.
That
's
all
very
well
,
but
do
you
know
*NL*
her
house
,
Sancho
?
My
master
says
it
will
be
some
royal
palace
or
grand
*NL*
castle
.
And
have
you
ever
seen
her
by
any
chance
?
Neither
I
nor
my
master
*NL*
ever
saw
her
.
And
does
it
strike
you
that
it
would
be
just
and
right
if
*NL*
the
El
Toboso
people
,
finding
out
that
you
were
here
with
the
intention
*NL*
of
going
to
tamper
with
their
princesses
and
trouble
their
ladies
,
were
*NL*
to
come
and
cudgel
your
ribs
,
and
not
leave
a
whole
bone
in
you
?
They
*NL*
would
,
indeed
,
have
very
good
reason
,
if
they
did
not
see
that
I
am
under
*NL*
orders
,
and
that
`
you
are
a
messenger
,
my
friend
,
no
blame
belongs
to
*NL*
you
.
'
Do
n't
you
trust
to
that
,
Sancho
,
for
the
Manchegan
folk
are
as
*NL*
hot-tempered
as
they
are
honest
,
and
wo
n't
put
up
with
liberties
from
*NL*
anybody
.
By
the
Lord
,
if
they
get
scent
of
you
,
it
will
be
worse
for
you
,
*NL*
I
promise
you
.
Be
off
,
you
scoundrel
!
Let
the
bolt
fall
.
Why
should
I
go
*NL*
looking
for
three
feet
on
a
cat
,
to
please
another
man
;
and
what
is
more
,
*NL*
when
looking
for
Dulcinea
will
be
looking
for
Marica
in
Ravena
,
or
the
*NL*
bachelor
in
Salamanca
?
The
devil
,
the
devil
and
nobody
else
,
has
mixed
me
*NL*
up
in
this
business
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
soliloquy
Sancho
held
with
himself
,
and
all
the
conclusion
*NL*
he
could
come
to
was
to
say
to
himself
again
,
``
Well
,
there
's
remedy
for
*NL*
everything
except
death
,
under
whose
yoke
we
have
all
to
pass
,
whether
we
*NL*
like
it
or
not
,
when
life
's
finished
.
I
have
seen
by
a
thousand
signs
*NL*
that
this
master
of
mine
is
a
madman
fit
to
be
tied
,
and
for
that
matter
,
*NL*
I
too
,
am
not
behind
him
;
for
I
'm
a
greater
fool
than
he
is
when
I
follow
*NL*
him
and
serve
him
,
if
there
's
any
truth
in
the
proverb
that
says
,
`
Tell
*NL*
me
what
company
thou
keepest
,
and
I
'll
tell
thee
what
thou
art
,
'
or
in
*NL*
that
other
,
`
Not
with
whom
thou
art
bred
,
but
with
whom
thou
art
fed
.
'
*NL*
Well
then
,
if
he
be
mad
,
as
he
is
,
and
with
a
madness
that
mostly
takes
*NL*
one
thing
for
another
,
and
white
for
black
,
and
black
for
white
,
as
was
*NL*
seen
when
he
said
the
windmills
were
giants
,
and
the
monks
'
mules
*NL*
dromedaries
,
flocks
of
sheep
armies
of
enemies
,
and
much
more
to
the
same
*NL*
tune
,
it
will
not
be
very
hard
to
make
him
believe
that
some
country
*NL*
girl
,
the
first
I
come
across
here
,
is
the
lady
Dulcinea
;
and
if
he
does
*NL*
not
believe
it
,
I
'll
swear
it
;
and
if
he
should
swear
,
I
'll
swear
again
;
*NL*
and
if
he
persists
I
'll
persist
still
more
,
so
as
,
come
what
may
,
to
have
*NL*
my
quoit
always
over
the
peg
.
Maybe
,
by
holding
out
in
this
way
,
I
may
*NL*
put
a
stop
to
his
sending
me
on
messages
of
this
kind
another
time
;
or
*NL*
maybe
he
will
think
,
as
I
suspect
he
will
,
that
one
of
those
wicked
*NL*
enchanters
,
who
he
says
have
a
spite
against
him
,
has
changed
her
form
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
doing
him
an
ill
turn
and
injuring
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
reflection
Sancho
made
his
mind
easy
,
counting
the
business
as
*NL*
good
as
settled
,
and
stayed
there
till
the
afternoon
so
as
to
make
Don
*NL*
Quixote
think
he
had
time
enough
to
go
to
El
Toboso
and
return
;
and
*NL*
things
turned
out
so
luckily
for
him
that
as
he
got
up
to
mount
Dapple
,
*NL*
he
spied
,
coming
from
El
Toboso
towards
the
spot
where
he
stood
,
three
*NL*
peasant
girls
on
three
colts
,
or
fillies
--
for
the
author
does
not
make
*NL*
the
point
clear
,
though
it
is
more
likely
they
were
she-asses
,
the
usual
*NL*
mount
with
village
girls
;
but
as
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
,
we
need
*NL*
not
stop
to
prove
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
brief
,
the
instant
Sancho
saw
the
peasant
girls
,
he
returned
full
*NL*
speed
to
seek
his
master
,
and
found
him
sighing
and
uttering
a
thousand
*NL*
passionate
lamentations
.
When
Don
Quixote
saw
him
he
exclaimed
,
``
What
*NL*
news
,
Sancho
,
my
friend
?
Am
I
to
mark
this
day
with
a
white
stone
or
a
*NL*
black
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
had
better
mark
it
with
ruddle
,
like
the
*NL*
inscriptions
on
the
walls
of
class
rooms
,
that
those
who
see
it
may
see
*NL*
it
plain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
thou
bringest
good
news
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
good
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
that
your
worship
has
only
to
spur
Rocinante
*NL*
and
get
out
into
the
open
field
to
see
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
who
,
*NL*
with
two
others
,
damsels
of
hers
,
is
coming
to
see
your
worship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
God
!
what
art
thou
saying
,
Sancho
,
my
friend
?
''
exclaimed
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
``
Take
care
thou
art
not
deceiving
me
,
or
seeking
by
false
joy
to
*NL*
cheer
my
real
sadness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
could
I
get
by
deceiving
your
worship
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
*NL*
``
especially
when
it
will
so
soon
be
shown
whether
I
tell
the
truth
or
*NL*
not
?
Come
,
senor
,
push
on
,
and
you
will
see
the
princess
our
mistress
*NL*
coming
,
robed
and
adorned
--
in
fact
,
like
what
she
is
.
Her
damsels
and
she
*NL*
are
all
one
glow
of
gold
,
all
bunches
of
pearls
,
all
diamonds
,
all
*NL*
rubies
,
all
cloth
of
brocade
of
more
than
ten
borders
;
with
their
hair
*NL*
loose
on
their
shoulders
like
so
many
sunbeams
playing
with
the
wind
;
and
*NL*
moreover
,
they
come
mounted
on
three
piebald
cackneys
,
the
finest
sight
*NL*
ever
you
saw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hackneys
,
you
mean
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
not
much
difference
between
cackneys
and
hackneys
,
''
said
*NL*
Sancho
;
``
but
no
matter
what
they
come
on
,
there
they
are
,
the
finest
*NL*
ladies
one
could
wish
for
,
especially
my
lady
the
princess
Dulcinea
,
who
*NL*
staggers
one
's
senses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
Sancho
,
my
son
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
in
guerdon
of
this
*NL*
news
,
as
unexpected
as
it
is
good
,
I
bestow
upon
thee
the
best
spoil
I
*NL*
shall
win
in
the
first
adventure
I
may
have
;
or
if
that
does
not
satisfy
*NL*
thee
,
I
promise
thee
the
foals
I
shall
have
this
year
from
my
three
mares
*NL*
that
thou
knowest
are
in
foal
on
our
village
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
take
the
foals
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
it
is
not
quite
certain
that
the
*NL*
spoils
of
the
first
adventure
will
be
good
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
they
had
cleared
the
wood
,
and
saw
the
three
village
lasses
*NL*
close
at
hand
.
Don
Quixote
looked
all
along
the
road
to
El
Toboso
,
and
as
*NL*
he
could
see
nobody
except
the
three
peasant
girls
,
he
was
completely
*NL*
puzzled
,
and
asked
Sancho
if
it
was
outside
the
city
he
had
left
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
outside
the
city
?
''
returned
Sancho
.
``
Are
your
worship
's
eyes
in
the
*NL*
back
of
your
head
,
that
you
ca
n't
see
that
they
are
these
who
are
coming
*NL*
here
,
shining
like
the
very
sun
at
noonday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
nothing
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
three
country
girls
on
*NL*
three
jackasses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
may
God
deliver
me
from
the
devil
!
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
can
it
be
*NL*
that
your
worship
takes
three
hackneys
--
or
whatever
they
're
called-as
*NL*
white
as
the
driven
snow
,
for
jackasses
?
By
the
Lord
,
I
could
tear
my
*NL*
beard
if
that
was
the
case
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
can
only
say
,
Sancho
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
it
is
*NL*
as
plain
they
are
jackasses
--
or
jennyasses
--
as
that
I
am
Don
Quixote
,
and
*NL*
thou
Sancho
Panza
:
at
any
rate
,
they
seem
to
me
to
be
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
do
n't
talk
that
way
,
but
open
your
eyes
,
and
*NL*
come
and
pay
your
respects
to
the
lady
of
your
thoughts
,
who
is
close
*NL*
upon
us
now
;
''
and
with
these
words
he
advanced
to
receive
the
three
*NL*
village
lasses
,
and
dismounting
from
Dapple
,
caught
hold
of
one
of
the
*NL*
asses
of
the
three
country
girls
by
the
halter
,
and
dropping
on
both
*NL*
knees
on
the
ground
,
he
said
,
``
Queen
and
princess
and
duchess
of
beauty
,
*NL*
may
it
please
your
haughtiness
and
greatness
to
receive
into
your
favour
*NL*
and
good-will
your
captive
knight
who
stands
there
turned
into
marble
*NL*
stone
,
and
quite
stupefied
and
benumbed
at
finding
himself
in
your
*NL*
magnificent
presence
.
I
am
Sancho
Panza
,
his
squire
,
and
he
the
vagabond
*NL*
knight
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
otherwise
called
`
The
Knight
of
the
*NL*
Rueful
Countenance
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
had
by
this
time
placed
himself
on
his
knees
beside
Sancho
,
*NL*
and
,
with
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
and
a
puzzled
gaze
,
was
regarding
*NL*
her
whom
Sancho
called
queen
and
lady
;
and
as
he
could
see
nothing
in
her
*NL*
except
a
village
lass
,
and
not
a
very
well-favoured
one
,
for
she
was
*NL*
platter-faced
and
snub-nosed
,
he
was
perplexed
and
bewildered
,
and
did
*NL*
not
venture
to
open
his
lips
.
The
country
girls
,
at
the
same
time
,
were
*NL*
astonished
to
see
these
two
men
,
so
different
in
appearance
,
on
their
*NL*
knees
,
preventing
their
companion
from
going
on
.
She
,
however
,
who
had
*NL*
been
stopped
,
breaking
silence
,
said
angrily
and
testily
,
``
Get
out
of
the
*NL*
way
,
bad
luck
to
you
,
and
let
us
pass
,
for
we
are
in
a
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
returned
,
``
Oh
,
princess
and
universal
lady
of
El
Toboso
,
*NL*
is
not
your
magnanimous
heart
softened
by
seeing
the
pillar
and
prop
of
*NL*
knight-errantry
on
his
knees
before
your
sublimated
presence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
,
one
of
the
others
exclaimed
,
``
Woa
then
!
why
,
I
'm
rubbing
*NL*
thee
down
,
she-ass
of
my
father-in-law
!
See
how
the
lordlings
come
to
*NL*
make
game
of
the
village
girls
now
,
as
if
we
here
could
not
chaff
as
well
*NL*
as
themselves
.
Go
your
own
way
,
and
let
us
go
ours
,
and
it
will
be
better
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
;
``
I
see
that
fortune
,
`
with
*NL*
evil
done
to
me
unsated
still
,
'
has
taken
possession
of
all
the
roads
by
*NL*
which
any
comfort
may
reach
`
this
wretched
soul
'
that
I
carry
in
my
*NL*
flesh
.
And
thou
,
highest
perfection
of
excellence
that
can
be
desired
,
*NL*
utmost
limit
of
grace
in
human
shape
,
sole
relief
of
this
afflicted
heart
*NL*
that
adores
thee
,
though
the
malign
enchanter
that
persecutes
me
has
*NL*
brought
clouds
and
cataracts
on
my
eyes
,
and
to
them
,
and
them
only
,
*NL*
transformed
thy
unparagoned
beauty
and
changed
thy
features
into
those
of
*NL*
a
poor
peasant
girl
,
if
so
be
he
has
not
at
the
same
time
changed
mine
*NL*
into
those
of
some
monster
to
render
them
loathsome
in
thy
sight
,
refuse
*NL*
not
to
look
upon
me
with
tenderness
and
love
;
seeing
in
this
submission
*NL*
that
I
make
on
my
knees
to
thy
transformed
beauty
the
humility
with
which
*NL*
my
soul
adores
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey-day
!
My
grandfather
!
''
cried
the
girl
,
``
much
I
care
for
your
*NL*
love-making
!
Get
out
of
the
way
and
let
us
pass
,
and
we
'll
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
stood
aside
and
let
her
go
,
very
well
pleased
to
have
got
so
well
*NL*
out
of
the
hobble
he
was
in
.
The
instant
the
village
lass
who
had
done
*NL*
duty
for
Dulcinea
found
herself
free
,
prodding
her
``
cackney
''
with
a
spike
*NL*
she
had
at
the
end
of
a
stick
,
she
set
off
at
full
speed
across
the
*NL*
field
.
The
she-ass
,
however
,
feeling
the
point
more
acutely
than
usual
,
*NL*
began
cutting
such
capers
,
that
it
flung
the
lady
Dulcinea
to
the
ground
;
*NL*
seeing
which
,
Don
Quixote
ran
to
raise
her
up
,
and
Sancho
to
fix
and
*NL*
girth
the
pack-saddle
,
which
also
had
slipped
under
the
ass
's
belly
.
The
*NL*
pack-saddle
being
secured
,
as
Don
Quixote
was
about
to
lift
up
his
*NL*
enchanted
mistress
in
his
arms
and
put
her
upon
her
beast
,
the
lady
,
*NL*
getting
up
from
the
ground
,
saved
him
the
trouble
,
for
,
going
back
a
*NL*
little
,
she
took
a
short
run
,
and
putting
both
hands
on
the
croup
of
the
*NL*
ass
she
dropped
into
the
saddle
more
lightly
than
a
falcon
,
and
sat
*NL*
astride
like
a
man
,
whereat
Sancho
said
,
``
Rogue
!
but
our
lady
is
lighter
*NL*
than
a
lanner
,
and
might
teach
the
cleverest
Cordovan
or
Mexican
how
to
*NL*
mount
;
she
cleared
the
back
of
the
saddle
in
one
jump
,
and
without
spurs
*NL*
she
is
making
the
hackney
go
like
a
zebra
;
and
her
damsels
are
no
way
*NL*
behind
her
,
for
they
all
fly
like
the
wind
;
''
which
was
the
truth
,
for
as
*NL*
soon
as
they
saw
Dulcinea
mounted
,
they
pushed
on
after
her
,
and
sped
*NL*
away
without
looking
back
,
for
more
than
half
a
league
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
followed
them
with
his
eyes
,
and
when
they
were
no
longer
in
*NL*
sight
,
he
turned
to
Sancho
and
said
,
``
How
now
,
Sancho
?
thou
seest
how
I
*NL*
am
hated
by
enchanters
!
And
see
to
what
a
length
the
malice
and
spite
*NL*
they
bear
me
go
,
when
they
seek
to
deprive
me
of
the
happiness
it
would
*NL*
give
me
to
see
my
lady
in
her
own
proper
form
.
The
fact
is
I
was
born
to
*NL*
be
an
example
of
misfortune
,
and
the
target
and
mark
at
which
the
arrows
*NL*
of
adversity
are
aimed
and
directed
.
Observe
too
,
Sancho
,
that
these
*NL*
traitors
were
not
content
with
changing
and
transforming
my
Dulcinea
,
but
*NL*
they
transformed
and
changed
her
into
a
shape
as
mean
and
ill-favoured
as
*NL*
that
of
the
village
girl
yonder
;
and
at
the
same
time
they
robbed
her
of
*NL*
that
which
is
such
a
peculiar
property
of
ladies
of
distinction
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
the
sweet
fragrance
that
comes
of
being
always
among
perfumes
and
*NL*
flowers
.
For
I
must
tell
thee
,
Sancho
,
that
when
I
approached
to
put
*NL*
Dulcinea
upon
her
hackney
-LRB-
as
thou
sayest
it
was
,
though
to
me
it
*NL*
appeared
a
she-ass
-RRB-
,
she
gave
me
a
whiff
of
raw
garlic
that
made
my
head
*NL*
reel
,
and
poisoned
my
very
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
scum
of
the
earth
!
''
cried
Sancho
at
this
,
``
O
miserable
,
spiteful
*NL*
enchanters
!
O
that
I
could
see
you
all
strung
by
the
gills
,
like
sardines
*NL*
on
a
twig
!
Ye
know
a
great
deal
,
ye
can
do
a
great
deal
,
and
ye
do
a
*NL*
great
deal
more
.
It
ought
to
have
been
enough
for
you
,
ye
scoundrels
,
to
*NL*
have
changed
the
pearls
of
my
lady
's
eyes
into
oak
galls
,
and
her
hair
of
*NL*
purest
gold
into
the
bristles
of
a
red
ox
's
tail
,
and
in
short
,
all
her
*NL*
features
from
fair
to
foul
,
without
meddling
with
her
smell
;
for
by
that
*NL*
we
might
somehow
have
found
out
what
was
hidden
underneath
that
ugly
*NL*
rind
;
though
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
never
perceived
her
ugliness
,
but
only
*NL*
her
beauty
,
which
was
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
of
perfection
by
a
mole
*NL*
she
had
on
her
right
lip
,
like
a
moustache
,
with
seven
or
eight
red
hairs
*NL*
like
threads
of
gold
,
and
more
than
a
palm
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
correspondence
which
exists
between
those
of
the
face
and
those
*NL*
of
the
body
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
Dulcinea
must
have
another
mole
*NL*
resembling
that
on
the
thick
of
the
thigh
on
that
side
on
which
she
has
*NL*
the
one
on
her
face
;
but
hairs
of
the
length
thou
hast
mentioned
are
very
*NL*
long
for
moles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
I
can
say
is
there
they
were
as
plain
as
could
be
,
''
replied
*NL*
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
,
my
friend
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
nature
bestowed
*NL*
nothing
on
Dulcinea
that
was
not
perfect
and
well-finished
;
and
so
,
if
*NL*
she
had
a
hundred
moles
like
the
one
thou
hast
described
,
in
her
they
*NL*
would
not
be
moles
,
but
moons
and
shining
stars
.
But
tell
me
,
Sancho
,
*NL*
that
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
pack-saddle
as
thou
wert
fixing
it
,
was
*NL*
it
a
flat-saddle
or
a
side-saddle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
neither
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
but
a
jineta
saddle
,
with
a
field
*NL*
covering
worth
half
a
kingdom
,
so
rich
is
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
I
could
not
see
all
this
,
Sancho
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
once
more
*NL*
I
say
,
and
will
say
a
thousand
times
,
I
am
the
most
unfortunate
of
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
the
rogue
,
had
enough
to
do
to
hide
his
laughter
,
at
hearing
the
*NL*
simplicity
of
the
master
he
had
so
nicely
befooled
.
At
length
,
after
a
*NL*
good
deal
more
conversation
had
passed
between
them
,
they
remounted
their
*NL*
beasts

and
followed
the
road
to
Saragossa

they
expected
to
reach
*NL*
in
time
to
take
part
in
a
certain
grand

held
every

*NL*
in

before
they
got
there
things
happened
to
*NL*
them

so
many

so
important

so
strange

CHAPTER
XI

*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
STRANGE
ADVENTURE
WHICH
THE
VALIANT
DON
QUIXOTE
HAD
WITH
THE
CAR
*NL*
OR
CART
OF
``
THE
CORTES
OF
DEATH
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dejected
beyond
measure
did
Don
Quixote
pursue
his
journey
,
turning
over
*NL*
in
his
mind
the
cruel
trick
the
enchanters
had
played
him
in
changing
his
*NL*
lady
Dulcinea
into
the
vile
shape
of
the
village
lass
,
nor
could
he
think
*NL*
of
any
way
of
restoring
her
to
her
original
form
;
and
these
reflections
*NL*
so
absorbed
him
,
that
without
being
aware
of
it
he
let
go
Rocinante
's
*NL*
bridle
,
and
he
,
perceiving
the
liberty
that
was
granted
him
,
stopped
at
*NL*
every
step
to
crop
the
fresh
grass
with
which
the
plain
abounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
recalled
him
from
his
reverie
.
``
Melancholy
,
senor
,
''
said
he
,
``
was
*NL*
made
,
not
for
beasts
,
but
for
men
;
but
if
men
give
way
to
it
overmuch
*NL*
they
turn
to
beasts
;
control
yourself
,
your
worship
;
be
yourself
again
;
*NL*
gather
up
Rocinante
's
reins
;
cheer
up
,
rouse
yourself
and
show
that
*NL*
gallant
spirit
that
knights-errant
ought
to
have
.
What
the
devil
is
this
?
*NL*
What
weakness
is
this
?
Are
we
here
or
in
France
?
The
devil
fly
away
with
*NL*
all
the
Dulcineas
in
the
world
;
for
the
well-being
of
a
single
*NL*
knight-errant
is
of
more
consequence
than
all
the
enchantments
and
*NL*
transformations
on
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
in
a
weak
and
faint
voice
,
``
hush
and
*NL*
utter
no
blasphemies
against
that
enchanted
lady
;
for
I
alone
am
to
blame
*NL*
for
her
misfortune
and
hard
fate
;
her
calamity
has
come
of
the
hatred
the
*NL*
wicked
bear
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
say
I
,
''
returned
Sancho
;
``
his
heart
rend
in
twain
,
I
trow
,
who
saw
*NL*
her
once
,
to
see
her
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
mayest
well
say
that
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
as
thou
sawest
*NL*
her
in
the
full
perfection
of
her
beauty
;
for
the
enchantment
does
not
go
*NL*
so
far
as
to
pervert
thy
vision
or
hide
her
loveliness
from
thee
;
against
*NL*
me
alone
and
against
my
eyes
is
the
strength
of
its
venom
directed
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
is
one
thing
which
has
occurred
to
me
,
and
that
is
*NL*
that
thou
didst
ill
describe
her
beauty
to
me
,
for
,
as
well
as
I
*NL*
recollect
,
thou
saidst
that
her
eyes
were
pearls
;
but
eyes
that
are
like
*NL*
pearls
are
rather
the
eyes
of
a
sea-bream
than
of
a
lady
,
and
I
am
*NL*
persuaded
that
Dulcinea
's
must
be
green
emeralds
,
full
and
soft
,
with
two
*NL*
rainbows
for
eyebrows
;
take
away
those
pearls
from
her
eyes
and
transfer
*NL*
them
to
her
teeth
;
for
beyond
a
doubt
,
Sancho
,
thou
hast
taken
the
one
*NL*
for
the
other
,
the
eyes
for
the
teeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
her
beauty
bewildered
me
as
much
as
her
*NL*
ugliness
did
your
worship
;
but
let
us
leave
it
all
to
God
,
who
alone
*NL*
knows
what
is
to
happen
in
this
vale
of
tears
,
in
this
evil
world
of
*NL*
ours
,
where
there
is
hardly
a
thing
to
be
found
without
some
mixture
of
*NL*
wickedness
,
roguery
,
and
rascality
.
But
one
thing
,
senor
,
troubles
me
*NL*
more
than
all
the
rest
,
and
that
is
thinking
what
is
to
be
done
when
your
*NL*
worship
conquers
some
giant
,
or
some
other
knight
,
and
orders
him
to
go
*NL*
and
present
himself
before
the
beauty
of
the
lady
Dulcinea
.
Where
is
this
*NL*
poor
giant
,
or
this
poor
wretch
of
a
vanquished
knight
,
to
find
her
?
I
*NL*
think
I
can
see
them
wandering
all
over
El
Toboso
,
looking
like
noddies
,
*NL*
and
asking
for
my
lady
Dulcinea
;
and
even
if
they
meet
her
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
street
they
wo
n't
know
her
any
more
than
they
would
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
Sancho
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
enchantment
does
not
go
so
*NL*
far
as
to
deprive
conquered
and
presented
giants
and
knights
of
the
power
*NL*
of
recognising
Dulcinea
;
we
will
try
by
experiment
with
one
or
two
of
the
*NL*
first
I
vanquish
and
send
to
her
,
whether
they
see
her
or
not
,
by
*NL*
commanding
them
to
return
and
give
me
an
account
of
what
happened
to
them
*NL*
in
this
respect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
declare
,
I
think
what
your
worship
has
proposed
is
excellent
,
''
said
*NL*
Sancho
;
``
and
that
by
this
plan
we
shall
find
out
what
we
want
to
know
;
*NL*
and
if
it
be
that
it
is
only
from
your
worship
she
is
hidden
,
the
*NL*
misfortune
will
be
more
yours
than
hers
;
but
so
long
as
the
lady
Dulcinea
*NL*
is
well
and
happy
,
we
on
our
part
will
make
the
best
of
it
,
and
get
on
as
*NL*
well
as
we
can
,
seeking
our
adventures
,
and
leaving
Time
to
take
his
own
*NL*
course
;
for
he
is
the
best
physician
for
these
and
greater
ailments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
about
to
reply
to
Sancho
Panza
,
but
he
was
prevented
by
a
*NL*
cart
crossing
the
road
full
of
the
most
diverse
and
strange
personages
*NL*
and
figures
that
could
be
imagined
.
He
who
led
the
mules
and
acted
as
*NL*
carter
was
a
hideous
demon
;
the
cart
was
open
to
the
sky
,
without
a
tilt
*NL*
or
cane
roof
,
and
the
first
figure
that
presented
itself
to
Don
Quixote
's
*NL*
eyes
was
that
of
Death
itself
with
a
human
face
;
next
to
it
was
an
angel
*NL*
with
large
painted
wings
,
and
at
one
side
an
emperor
,
with
a
crown
,
to
*NL*
all
appearance
of
gold
,
on
his
head
.
At
the
feet
of
Death
was
the
god
*NL*
called
Cupid
,
without
his
bandage
,
but
with
his
bow
,
quiver
,
and
arrows
;
*NL*
there
was
also
a
knight
in
full
armour
,
except
that
he
had
no
morion
or
*NL*
helmet
,
but
only
a
hat
decked
with
plumes
of
divers
colours
;
and
along
*NL*
with
these
there
were
others
with
a
variety
of
costumes
and
faces
.
All
*NL*
this
,
unexpectedly
encountered
,
took
Don
Quixote
somewhat
aback
,
and
*NL*
struck
terror
into
the
heart
of
Sancho
;
but
the
next
instant
Don
Quixote
*NL*
was
glad
of
it
,
believing
that
some
new
perilous
adventure
was
presenting
*NL*
itself
to
him
,
and
under
this
impression
,
and
with
a
spirit
prepared
to
*NL*
face
any
danger
,
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
cart
,
and
in
a
loud
*NL*
and
menacing
tone
,
exclaimed
,
``
Carter
,
or
coachman
,
or
devil
,
or
whatever
*NL*
thou
art
,
tell
me
at
once
who
thou
art
,
whither
thou
art
going
,
and
who
*NL*
these
folk
are
thou
carriest
in
thy
wagon
,
which
looks
more
like
Charon
's
*NL*
boat
than
an
ordinary
cart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
devil
,
stopping
the
cart
,
answered
quietly
,
``
Senor
,
we
are
*NL*
players
of
Angulo
el
Malo
's
company
;
we
have
been
acting
the
play
of
`
The
*NL*
Cortes
of
Death
'
this
morning
,
which
is
the
octave
of
Corpus
Christi
,
in
*NL*
a
village
behind
that
hill
,
and
we
have
to
act
it
this
afternoon
in
that
*NL*
village
which
you
can
see
from
this
;
and
as
it
is
so
near
,
and
to
save
*NL*
the
trouble
of
undressing
and
dressing
again
,
we
go
in
the
costumes
in
*NL*
which
we
perform
.
That
lad
there
appears
as
Death
,
that
other
as
an
*NL*
angel
,
that
woman
,
the
manager
's
wife
,
plays
the
queen
,
this
one
the
*NL*
soldier
,
that
the
emperor
,
and
I
the
devil
;
and
I
am
one
of
the
principal
*NL*
characters
of
the
play
,
for
in
this
company
I
take
the
leading
parts
.
If
*NL*
you
want
to
know
anything
more
about
us
,
ask
me
and
I
will
answer
with
*NL*
the
utmost
exactitude
,
for
as
I
am
a
devil
I
am
up
to
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
faith
of
a
knight-errant
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
when
I
saw
this
*NL*
cart
I
fancied
some
great
adventure
was
presenting
itself
to
me
;
but
I
*NL*
declare
one
must
touch
with
the
hand
what
appears
to
the
eye
,
if
*NL*
illusions
are
to
be
avoided
.
God
speed
you
,
good
people
;
keep
your
*NL*
festival
,
and
remember
,
if
you
demand
of
me
ought
wherein
I
can
render
*NL*
you
a
service
,
I
will
do
it
gladly
and
willingly
,
for
from
a
child
I
was
*NL*
fond
of
the
play
,
and
in
my
youth
a
keen
lover
of
the
actor
's
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
talking
,
fate
so
willed
it
that
one
of
the
company
in
a
*NL*
mummers
'
dress
with
a
great
number
of
bells
,
and
armed
with
three
blown
*NL*
ox-bladders
at
the
end
of
a
stick
,
joined
them
,
and
this
merry-andrew
*NL*
approaching
Don
Quixote
,
began
flourishing
his
stick
and
banging
the
*NL*
ground
with
the
bladders
and
cutting
capers
with
great
jingling
of
the
*NL*
bells
,
which
untoward
apparition
so
startled
Rocinante
that
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
efforts
to
hold
him
in
,
taking
the
bit
between
his
teeth
he
*NL*
set
off
across
the
plain
with
greater
speed
than
the
bones
of
his
anatomy
*NL*
ever
gave
any
promise
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
who
thought
his
master
was
in
danger
of
being
thrown
,
jumped
off
*NL*
Dapple
,
and
ran
in
all
haste
to
help
him
;
but
by
the
time
he
reached
him
*NL*
he
was
already
on
the
ground
,
and
beside
him
was
Rocinante
,
who
had
come
*NL*
down
with
his
master
,
the
usual
end
and
upshot
of
Rocinante
's
vivacity
*NL*
and
high
spirits
.
But
the
moment
Sancho
quitted
his
beast
to
go
and
help
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
the
dancing
devil
with
the
bladders
jumped
up
on
Dapple
,
and
*NL*
beating
him
with
them
,
more
by
the
fright
and
the
noise
than
by
the
pain
*NL*
of
the
blows
,
made
him
fly
across
the
fields
towards
the
village
where
*NL*
they
were
going
to
hold
their
festival
.
Sancho
witnessed
Dapple
's
career
*NL*
and
his
master
's
fall
,
and
did
not
know
which
of
the
two
cases
of
need
he
*NL*
should
attend
to
first
;
but
in
the
end
,
like
a
good
squire
and
good
*NL*
servant
,
he
let
his
love
for
his
master
prevail
over
his
affection
for
*NL*
his
ass
;
though
every
time
he
saw
the
bladders
rise
in
the
air
and
come
*NL*
down
on
the
hind
quarters
of
his
Dapple
he
felt
the
pains
and
terrors
of
*NL*
death
,
and
he
would
have
rather
had
the
blows
fall
on
the
apples
of
his
*NL*
own
eyes
than
on
the
least
hair
of
his
ass
's
tail
.
In
this
trouble
and
*NL*
perplexity
he
came
to
where
Don
Quixote
lay
in
a
far
sorrier
plight
than
*NL*
he
liked
,
and
having
helped
him
to
mount
Rocinante
,
he
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Senor
,
the
devil
has
carried
off
my
Dapple
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
devil
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
with
the
bladders
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
recover
him
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
even
if
he
be
shut
up
with
*NL*
him
in
the
deepest
and
darkest
dungeons
of
hell
.
Follow
me
,
Sancho
,
for
*NL*
the
cart
goes
slowly
,
and
with
the
mules
of
it
I
will
make
good
the
loss
*NL*
of
Dapple
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
take
the
trouble
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
keep
cool
,
for
as
I
*NL*
now
see
,
the
devil
has
let
Dapple
go
and
he
is
coming
back
to
his
old
*NL*
quarters
;
''
and
so
it
turned
out
,
for
,
having
come
down
with
Dapple
,
in
*NL*
imitation
of
Don
Quixote
and
Rocinante
,
the
devil
made
off
on
foot
to
the
*NL*
town
,
and
the
ass
came
back
to
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
it
will
be
well
to
visit
the
*NL*
discourtesy
of
that
devil
upon
some
of
those
in
the
cart
,
even
if
it
were
*NL*
the
emperor
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
of
it
,
your
worship
,
''
returned
Sancho
;
``
take
my
advice
and
*NL*
never
meddle
with
actors
,
for
they
are
a
favoured
class
;
I
myself
have
*NL*
known
an
actor
taken
up
for
two
murders
,
and
yet
come
off
scot-free
;
*NL*
remember
that
,
as
they
are
merry
folk
who
give
pleasure
,
everyone
favours
*NL*
and
protects
them
,
and
helps
and
makes
much
of
them
,
above
all
when
they
*NL*
are
those
of
the
royal
companies
and
under
patent
,
all
or
most
of
whom
in
*NL*
dress
and
appearance
look
like
princes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
for
all
that
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
player
devil
must
not
go
*NL*
off
boasting
,
even
if
the
whole
human
race
favours
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
made
for
the
cart
,
which
was
now
very
near
the
town
,
*NL*
shouting
out
as
he
went
,
``
Stay
!
halt
!
ye
merry
,
jovial
crew
!
I
want
to
*NL*
teach
you
how
to
treat
asses
and
animals
that
serve
the
squires
of
*NL*
knights-errant
for
steeds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
loud
were
the
shouts
of
Don
Quixote
,
that
those
in
the
cart
heard
and
*NL*
understood
them
,
and
,
guessing
by
the
words
what
the
speaker
's
intention
*NL*
was
,
Death
in
an
instant
jumped
out
of
the
cart
,
and
the
emperor
,
the
*NL*
devil
carter
and
the
angel
after
him
,
nor
did
the
queen
or
the
god
Cupid
*NL*
stay
behind
;
and
all
armed
themselves
with
stones
and
formed
in
line
,
*NL*
prepared
to
receive
Don
Quixote
on
the
points
of
their
pebbles
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
when
he
saw
them
drawn
up
in
such
a
gallant
array
with
uplifted
*NL*
arms
ready
for
a
mighty
discharge
of
stones
,
checked
Rocinante
and
began
*NL*
to
consider
in
what
way
he
could
attack
them
with
the
least
danger
to
*NL*
himself
.
As
he
halted
Sancho
came
up
,
and
seeing
him
disposed
to
attack
*NL*
this
well-ordered
squadron
,
said
to
him
,
``
It
would
be
the
height
of
*NL*
madness
to
attempt
such
an
enterprise
;
remember
,
senor
,
that
against
sops
*NL*
from
the
brook
,
and
plenty
of
them
,
there
is
no
defensive
armour
in
the
*NL*
world
,
except
to
stow
oneself
away
under
a
brass
bell
;
and
besides
,
one
*NL*
should
remember
that
it
is
rashness
,
and
not
valour
,
for
a
single
man
to
*NL*
attack
an
army
that
has
Death
in
it
,
and
where
emperors
fight
in
person
,
*NL*
with
angels
,
good
and
bad
,
to
help
them
;
and
if
this
reflection
will
not
*NL*
make
you
keep
quiet
,
perhaps
it
will
to
know
for
certain
that
among
all
*NL*
these
,
though
they
look
like
kings
,
princes
,
and
emperors
,
there
is
not
a
*NL*
single
knight-errant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
indeed
thou
hast
hit
the
point
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
which
*NL*
may
and
should
turn
me
from
the
resolution
I
had
already
formed
.
I
can
not
*NL*
and
must
not
draw
sword
,
as
I
have
many
a
time
before
told
thee
,
against
*NL*
anyone
who
is
not
a
dubbed
knight
;
it
is
for
thee
,
Sancho
,
if
thou
wilt
,
*NL*
to
take
vengeance
for
the
wrong
done
to
thy
Dapple
;
and
I
will
help
thee
*NL*
from
here
by
shouts
and
salutary
counsels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
occasion
to
take
vengeance
on
anyone
,
senor
,
''
replied
*NL*
Sancho
;
``
for
it
is
not
the
part
of
good
Christians
to
revenge
wrongs
;
and
*NL*
besides
,
I
will
arrange
it
with
my
ass
to
leave
his
grievance
to
my
*NL*
good-will
and
pleasure
,
and
that
is
to
live
in
peace
as
long
as
heaven
*NL*
grants
me
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,

said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
that
be
thy
determination

good
Sancho

*NL*
sensible
Sancho
,
Christian
Sancho
,
honest
Sancho

let
us
leave
these
*NL*
phantoms
alone
and
turn
to
the
pursuit
of
better
and
worthier
adventures
;
*NL*
for
,
from
what
I
see
of
this
country
,
we
can
not
fail
to
find
plenty
of
*NL*
marvellous
ones
in
it

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
STRANGE
ADVENTURE
WHICH
BEFELL
THE
VALIANT
DON
QUIXOTE
WITH
THE
*NL*
BOLD
KNIGHT
OF
THE
MIRRORS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
succeeding
the
day
of
the
encounter
with
Death
,
Don
Quixote
and
*NL*
his
squire
passed
under
some
tall
shady
trees
,
and
Don
Quixote
at
*NL*
Sancho
's
persuasion
ate
a
little
from
the
store
carried
by
Dapple
,
and
*NL*
over
their
supper
Sancho
said
to
his
master
,
``
Senor
,
what
a
fool
I
should
*NL*
have
looked
if
I
had
chosen
for
my
reward
the
spoils
of
the
first
*NL*
adventure
your
worship
achieved
,
instead
of
the
foals
of
the
three
mares
.
*NL*
After
all
,
'
a
sparrow
in
the
hand
is
better
than
a
vulture
on
the
wing
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
same
time
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
thou
hadst
let
me
*NL*
attack
them
as
I
wanted
,
at
the
very
least
the
emperor
's
gold
crown
and
*NL*
Cupid
's
painted
wings
would
have
fallen
to
thee
as
spoils
,
for
I
should
*NL*
have
taken
them
by
force
and
given
them
into
thy
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sceptres
and
crowns
of
those
play-actor
emperors
,
''
said
Sancho
,
*NL*
``
were
never
yet
pure
gold
,
but
only
brass
foil
or
tin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
it
would
not
be
right
that
the
*NL*
accessories
of
the
drama
should
be
real
,
instead
of
being
mere
fictions
*NL*
and
semblances
,
like
the
drama
itself
;
towards
which
,
Sancho-and
,
as
a
*NL*
necessary
consequence
,
towards
those
who
represent
and
produce
it
--
I
*NL*
would
that
thou
wert
favourably
disposed
,
for
they
are
all
instruments
of
*NL*
great
good
to
the
State
,
placing
before
us
at
every
step
a
mirror
in
*NL*
which
we
may
see
vividly
displayed
what
goes
on
in
human
life
;
nor
is
*NL*
there
any
similitude
that
shows
us
more
faithfully
what
we
are
and
ought
*NL*
to
be
than
the
play
and
the
players
.
Come
,
tell
me
,
hast
thou
not
seen
a
*NL*
play
acted
in
which
kings
,
emperors
,
pontiffs
,
knights
,
ladies
,
and
*NL*
divers
other
personages
were
introduced
?
One
plays
the
villain
,
another
*NL*
the
knave
,
this
one
the
merchant
,
that
the
soldier
,
one
the
sharp-witted
*NL*
fool
,
another
the
foolish
lover
;
and
when
the
play
is
over
,
and
they
have
*NL*
put
off
the
dresses
they
wore
in
it
,
all
the
actors
become
equal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
seen
that
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
the
same
thing
happens
in
the
comedy
and
*NL*
life
of
this
world
,
where
some
play
emperors
,
others
popes
,
and
,
in
*NL*
short
,
all
the
characters
that
can
be
brought
into
a
play
;
but
when
it
is
*NL*
over
,
that
is
to
say
when
life
ends
,
death
strips
them
all
of
the
*NL*
garments
that
distinguish
one
from
the
other
,
and
all
are
equal
in
the
*NL*
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
comparison
!
''
said
Sancho
;
``
though
not
so
new
but
that
I
have
*NL*
heard
it
many
and
many
a
time
,
as
well
as
that
other
one
of
the
game
of
*NL*
chess
;
how
,
so
long
as
the
game
lasts
,
each
piece
has
its
own
particular
*NL*
office
,
and
when
the
game
is
finished
they
are
all
mixed
,
jumbled
up
and
*NL*
shaken
together
,
and
stowed
away
in
the
bag
,
which
is
much
like
ending
*NL*
life
in
the
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
growing
less
doltish
and
more
shrewd
every
day
,
Sancho
,
''
said
*NL*
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
it
must
be
that
some
of
your
worship
's
shrewdness
*NL*
sticks
to
me
;
land
that
,
of
itself
,
is
barren
and
dry
,
will
come
to
yield
*NL*
good
fruit
if
you
dung
it
and
till
it
;
what
I
mean
is
that
your
worship
's
*NL*
conversation
has
been
the
dung
that
has
fallen
on
the
barren
soil
of
my
*NL*
dry
wit
,
and
the
time
I
have
been
in
your
service
and
society
has
been
*NL*
the
tillage
;
and
with
the
help
of
this
I
hope
to
yield
fruit
in
abundance
*NL*
that
will
not
fall
away
or
slide
from
those
paths
of
good
breeding
that
*NL*
your
worship
has
made
in
my
parched
understanding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
laughed
at
Sancho
's
affected
phraseology
,
and
perceived
that
*NL*
what
he
said
about
his
improvement
was
true
,
for
now
and
then
he
spoke
in
*NL*
a
way
that
surprised
him
;
though
always
,
or
mostly
,
when
Sancho
tried
to
*NL*
talk
fine
and
attempted
polite
language
,
he
wound
up
by
toppling
over
*NL*
from
the
summit
of
his
simplicity
into
the
abyss
of
his
ignorance
;
and
*NL*
where
he
showed
his
culture
and
his
memory
to
the
greatest
advantage
was
*NL*
in
dragging
in
proverbs
,
no
matter
whether
they
had
any
bearing
or
not
*NL*
upon
the
subject
in
hand
,
as
may
have
been
seen
already
and
will
be
*NL*
noticed
in
the
course
of
this
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
conversation
of
this
kind
they
passed
a
good
part
of
the
night
,
but
*NL*
Sancho
felt
a
desire
to
let
down
the
curtains
of
his
eyes
,
as
he
used
to
*NL*
say
when
he
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
;
and
stripping
Dapple
he
left
him
at
*NL*
liberty
to
graze
his
fill
.
He
did
not
remove
Rocinante
's
saddle
,
as
his
*NL*
master
's
express
orders
were
,
that
so
long
as
they
were
in
the
field
or
*NL*
not
sleeping
under
a
roof
Rocinante
was
not
to
be
stripped
--
the
ancient
*NL*
usage
established
and
observed
by
knights-errant
being
to
take
off
the
*NL*
bridle
and
hang
it
on
the
saddle-bow
,
but
to
remove
the
saddle
from
the
*NL*
horse
--
never
!
Sancho
acted
accordingly
,
and
gave
him
the
same
liberty
he
*NL*
had
given
Dapple
,
between
whom
and
Rocinante
there
was
a
friendship
so
*NL*
unequalled
and
so
strong
,
that
it
is
handed
down
by
tradition
from
father
*NL*
to
son
,
that
the
author
of
this
veracious
history
devoted
some
special
*NL*
chapters
to
it
,
which
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
propriety
and
decorum
due
*NL*
to
a
history
so
heroic
,
he
did
not
insert
therein
;
although
at
times
he
*NL*
forgets
this
resolution
of
his
and
describes
how
eagerly
the
two
beasts
*NL*
would
scratch
one
another
when
they
were
together
and
how
,
when
they
were
*NL*
tired
or
full
,
Rocinante
would
lay
his
neck
across
Dapple
's
,
stretching
*NL*
half
a
yard
or
more
on
the
other
side
,
and
the
pair
would
stand
thus
,
*NL*
gazing
thoughtfully
on
the
ground
,
for
three
days
,
or
at
least
so
long
as
*NL*
they
were
left
alone
,
or
hunger
did
not
drive
them
to
go
and
look
for
*NL*
food
.
I
may
add
that
they
say
the
author
left
it
on
record
that
he
*NL*
likened
their
friendship
to
that
of
Nisus
and
Euryalus
,
and
Pylades
and
*NL*
Orestes
;
and
if
that
be
so
,
it
may
be
perceived
,
to
the
admiration
of
*NL*
mankind
,
how
firm
the
friendship
must
have
been
between
these
two
*NL*
peaceful
animals
,
shaming
men
,
who
preserve
friendships
with
one
another
*NL*
so
badly
.
This
was
why
it
was
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
For
friend
no
longer
is
there
friend
;
*NL*
The
reeds
turn
lances
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
some
one
else
has
sung
--
*NL*
*NL*
Friend
to
friend
the
bug
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
let
no
one
fancy
that
the
author
was
at
all
astray
when
he
compared
*NL*
the
friendship
of
these
animals
to
that
of
men
;
for
men
have
received
*NL*
many
lessons
from
beasts
,
and
learned
many
important
things
,
as
,
for
*NL*
example
,
the
clyster
from
the
stork
,
vomit
and
gratitude
from
the
dog
,
*NL*
watchfulness
from
the
crane
,
foresight
from
the
ant
,
modesty
from
the
*NL*
elephant
,
and
loyalty
from
the
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
at
last
fell
asleep
at
the
foot
of
a
cork
tree
,
while
Don
Quixote
*NL*
dozed
at
that
of
a
sturdy
oak
;
but
a
short
time
only
had
elapsed
when
a
*NL*
noise
he
heard
behind
him
awoke
him
,
and
rising
up
startled
,
he
listened
*NL*
and
looked
in
the
direction
the
noise
came
from
,
and
perceived
two
men
on
*NL*
horseback
,
one
of
whom
,
letting
himself
drop
from
the
saddle
,
said
to
the
*NL*
other
,
``
Dismount
,
my
friend
,
and
take
the
bridles
off
the
horses
,
for
,
so
*NL*
far
as
I
can
see
,
this
place
will
furnish
grass
for
them
,
and
the
*NL*
solitude
and
silence
my
love-sick
thoughts
need
of
.
''
As
he
said
this
he
*NL*
stretched
himself
upon
the
ground
,
and
as
he
flung
himself
down
,
the
*NL*
armour
in
which
he
was
clad
rattled
,
whereby
Don
Quixote
perceived
that
*NL*
he
must
be
a
knight-errant
;
and
going
over
to
Sancho
,
who
was
asleep
,
he
*NL*
shook
him
by
the
arm
and
with
no
small
difficulty
brought
him
back
to
his
*NL*
senses
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
to
him
,
``
Brother
Sancho
,
we
have
got
an
*NL*
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
send
us
a
good
one
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
where
may
her
ladyship
the
*NL*
adventure
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
,
Sancho
?
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
turn
thine
eyes
and
look
,
and
thou
*NL*
wilt
see
stretched
there
a
knight-errant
,
who
,
it
strikes
me
,
is
not
over
*NL*
and
above
happy
,
for
I
saw
him
fling
himself
off
his
horse
and
throw
*NL*
himself
on
the
ground
with
a
certain
air
of
dejection
,
and
his
armour
*NL*
rattled
as
he
fell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
how
does
your
worship
make
out
that
to
be
an
*NL*
adventure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
mean
to
say
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
it
is
a
complete
*NL*
adventure
,
but
that
it
is
the
beginning
of
one
,
for
it
is
in
this
way
*NL*
adventures
begin
.
But
listen
,
for
it
seems
he
is
tuning
a
lute
or
guitar
,
*NL*
and
from
the
way
he
is
spitting
and
clearing
his
chest
he
must
be
getting
*NL*
ready
to
sing
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
,
you
are
right
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
no
doubt
he
is
some
enamoured
*NL*
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
knight-errant
that
is
not
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
let
us
*NL*
listen
to
him
,
for
,
if
he
sings
,
by
that
thread
we
shall
extract
the
ball
*NL*
of
his
thoughts
;
because
out
of
the
abundance
of
the
heart
the
mouth
*NL*
speaketh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
about
to
reply
to
his
master
,
but
the
Knight
of
the
Grove
's
*NL*
voice
,
which
was
neither
very
bad
nor
very
good
,
stopped
him
,
and
*NL*
listening
attentively
the
pair
heard
him
sing
this
*NL*
*NL*
SONNET
*NL*
*NL*
Your
pleasure
,
prithee
,
lady
mine
,
unfold
;
*NL*
Declare
the
terms
that
I
am
to
obey
;
*NL*
My
will
to
yours
submissively
I
mould
,
*NL*
And
from
your
law
my
feet
shall
never
stray
.
*NL*
Would
you
I
die
,
to
silent
grief
a
prey
?
*NL*
Then
count
me
even
now
as
dead
and
cold
;
*NL*
Would
you
I
tell
my
woes
in
some
new
way
?
*NL*
Then
shall
my
tale
by
Love
itself
be
told
.
*NL*
The
unison
of
opposites
to
prove
,
*NL*
Of
the
soft
wax
and
diamond
hard
am
I
;
*NL*
But
still
,
obedient
to
the
laws
of
love
,
*NL*
Here
,
hard
or
soft
,
I
offer
you
my
breast
,
*NL*
Whate'er
you
grave
or
stamp
thereon
shall
rest
*NL*
Indelible
for
all
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
``
Ah
me
!
''
that
seemed
to
be
drawn
from
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
*NL*
heart
,
the
Knight
of
the
Grove
brought
his
lay
to
an
end
,
and
shortly
*NL*
afterwards
exclaimed
in
a
melancholy
and
piteous
voice
,
``
O
fairest
and
*NL*
most
ungrateful
woman
on
earth
!
What
!
can
it
be
,
most
serene
Casildea
de
*NL*
Vandalia
,
that
thou
wilt
suffer
this
thy
captive
knight
to
waste
away
and
*NL*
perish
in
ceaseless
wanderings
and
rude
and
arduous
toils
?
It
is
not
*NL*
enough
that
I
have
compelled
all
the
knights
of
Navarre
,
all
the
Leonese
,
*NL*
all
the
Tartesians
,
all
the
Castilians
,
and
finally
all
the
knights
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
to
confess
thee
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
,
``
for
I
am
of
La
Mancha
,
and
I
have
*NL*
never
confessed
anything
of
the
sort
,
nor
could
I
nor
should
I
confess
a
*NL*
thing
so
much
to
the
prejudice
of
my
lady
's
beauty
;
thou
seest
how
this
*NL*
knight
is
raving
,
Sancho
.
But
let
us
listen
,
perhaps
he
will
tell
us
more
*NL*
about
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
will
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
for
he
seems
in
a
mood
to
bewail
*NL*
himself
for
a
month
at
a
stretch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
the
case
,
for
the
Knight
of
the
Grove
,
hearing
voices
*NL*
near
him
,
instead
of
continuing
his
lamentation
,
stood
up
and
exclaimed
*NL*
in
a
distinct
but
courteous
tone
,
``
Who
goes
there
?
What
are
you
?
Do
you
*NL*
belong
to
the
number
of
the
happy
or
of
the
miserable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
miserable
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
come
to
me
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
and
rest
assured
that
it
is
to
*NL*
woe
itself
and
affliction
itself
you
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
finding
himself
answered
in
such
a
soft
and
courteous
*NL*
manner
,
went
over
to
him
,
and
so
did
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doleful
knight
took
Don
Quixote
by
the
arm
,
saying
,
``
Sit
down
here
,
*NL*
sir
knight
;
for
,
that
you
are
one
,
and
of
those
that
profess
*NL*
knight-errantry
,
it
is
to
me
a
sufficient
proof
to
have
found
you
in
this
*NL*
place
,
where
solitude
and
night
,
the
natural
couch
and
proper
retreat
of
*NL*
knights-errant
,
keep
you
company
.
''
To
which
Don
made
answer
,
``
A
knight
I
*NL*
am
of
the
profession
you
mention
,
and
though
sorrows
,
misfortunes
,
and
*NL*
calamities
have
made
my
heart
their
abode
,
the
compassion
I
feel
for
the
*NL*
misfortunes
of
others
has
not
been
thereby
banished
from
it
.
From
what
*NL*
you
have
just
now
sung
I
gather
that
yours
spring
from
love
,
I
mean
from
*NL*
the
love
you
bear
that
fair
ingrate
you
named
in
your
lament
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
they
had
seated
themselves
together
on
the
hard
ground
*NL*
peaceably
and
sociably
,
just
as
if
,
as
soon
as
day
broke
,
they
were
not
*NL*
going
to
break
one
another
's
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
,
sir
knight
,
in
love
perchance
?
''
asked
he
of
the
Grove
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
mischance
I
am
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
though
the
ills
arising
from
*NL*
well-bestowed
affections
should
be
esteemed
favours
rather
than
*NL*
misfortunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
returned
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
if
scorn
did
not
unsettle
our
*NL*
reason
and
understanding
,
for
if
it
be
excessive
it
looks
like
revenge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
never
scorned
by
my
lady
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
''
said
Sancho
,
who
stood
close
by
,
``
for
my
lady
is
as
a
*NL*
lamb
,
and
softer
than
a
roll
of
butter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
your
squire
?
''
asked
he
of
the
Grove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
yet
saw
a
squire
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
who
ventured
to
speak
*NL*
when
his
master
was
speaking
;
at
least
,
there
is
mine
,
who
is
as
big
as
*NL*
his
father
,
and
it
can
not
be
proved
that
he
has
ever
opened
his
lips
when
*NL*
I
am
speaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
faith
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
have
spoken
,
and
am
fit
to
speak
,
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
one
as
much
,
or
even
--
but
never
mind
--
it
only
makes
it
*NL*
worse
to
stir
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
of
the
Grove
took
Sancho
by
the
arm
,
saying
to
him
,
``
Let
us
*NL*
two
go
where
we
can
talk
in
squire
style
as
much
as
we
please
,
and
leave
*NL*
these
gentlemen
our
masters
to
fight
it
out
over
the
story
of
their
*NL*
loves
;
and
,
depend
upon
it
,
daybreak
will
find
them
at
it
without
having
*NL*
made
an
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
by
all
means
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
I
will
tell
your
worship
who
I
*NL*
am
,
that
you
may
see
whether
I
am
to
be
reckoned
among
the
number
of
the
*NL*
most
talkative
squires
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
the
two
squires
withdrew
to
one
side
,
and
between
them
there
*NL*
passed
a
conversation
as
droll
as
that
which
passed
between
their
masters
*NL*
was
serious
.

CHAPTER
XIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
IS
CONTINUED
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
KNIGHT
OF
THE
GROVE
,
TOGETHER
*NL*
WITH
THE
SENSIBLE
,
ORIGINAL
,
AND
TRANQUIL
COLLOQUY
THAT
PASSED
BETWEEN
*NL*
THE
TWO
SQUIRES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
knights
and
the
squires
made
two
parties
,
these
telling
the
story
of
*NL*
their
lives
,
the
others
the
story
of
their
loves
;
but
the
history
relates
*NL*
first
of
all
the
conversation
of
the
servants
,
and
afterwards
takes
up
*NL*
that
of
the
masters
;
and
it
says
that
,
withdrawing
a
little
from
the
*NL*
others
,
he
of
the
Grove
said
to
Sancho
,
``
A
hard
life
it
is
we
lead
and
*NL*
live
,
senor
,
we
that
are
squires
to
knights-errant
;
verily
,
we
eat
our
*NL*
bread
in
the
sweat
of
our
faces
,
which
is
one
of
the
curses
God
laid
on
*NL*
our
first
parents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
said
,
too
,
''
added
Sancho
,
``
that
we
eat
it
in
the
chill
of
our
*NL*
bodies
;
for
who
gets
more
heat
and
cold
than
the
miserable
squires
of
*NL*
knight-errantry
?
Even
so
it
would
not
be
so
bad
if
we
had
something
to
*NL*
eat
,
for
woes
are
lighter
if
there
's
bread
;
but
sometimes
we
go
a
day
or
*NL*
two
without
breaking
our
fast
,
except
with
the
wind
that
blows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
may
be
endured
and
put
up
with
when
we
*NL*
have
hopes
of
reward
;
for
,
unless
the
knight-errant
he
serves
is
*NL*
excessively
unlucky
,
after
a
few
turns
the
squire
will
at
least
find
*NL*
himself
rewarded
with
a
fine
government
of
some
island
or
some
fair
*NL*
county
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
have
already
told
my
master
that
I
shall
be
content
*NL*
with
the
government
of
some
island
,
and
he
is
so
noble
and
generous
that
*NL*
he
has
promised
it
to
me
ever
so
many
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
shall
be
satisfied
with
a
canonry
for
my
*NL*
services
,
and
my
master
has
already
assigned
me
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
master
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
no
doubt
is
a
knight
in
the
Church
line
,
and
*NL*
can
bestow
rewards
of
that
sort
on
his
good
squire
;
but
mine
is
only
a
*NL*
layman
;
though
I
remember
some
clever
,
but
,
to
my
mind
,
designing
people
,
*NL*
strove
to
persuade
him
to
try
and
become
an
archbishop
.
He
,
however
,
*NL*
would
not
be
anything
but
an
emperor
;
but
I
was
trembling
all
the
time
*NL*
lest
he
should
take
a
fancy
to
go
into
the
Church
,
not
finding
myself
fit
*NL*
to
hold
office
in
it
;
for
I
may
tell
you
,
though
I
seem
a
man
,
I
am
no
*NL*
better
than
a
beast
for
the
Church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
you
are
wrong
there
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
;
``
for
those
*NL*
island
governments
are
not
all
satisfactory
;
some
are
awkward
,
some
are
*NL*
poor
,
some
are
dull
,
and
,
in
short
,
the
highest
and
choicest
brings
with
*NL*
it
a
heavy
burden
of
cares
and
troubles
which
the
unhappy
wight
to
whose
*NL*
lot
it
has
fallen
bears
upon
his
shoulders
.
Far
better
would
it
be
for
us
*NL*
who
have
adopted
this
accursed
service
to
go
back
to
our
own
houses
,
and
*NL*
there
employ
ourselves
in
pleasanter
occupations
--
in
hunting
or
fishing
,
*NL*
for
instance
;
for
what
squire
in
the
world
is
there
so
poor
as
not
to
*NL*
have
a
hack
and
a
couple
of
greyhounds
and
a
fishingrod
to
amuse
himself
*NL*
with
in
his
own
village
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
in
want
of
any
of
those
things
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
to
be
sure
I
*NL*
have
no
hack
,
but
I
have
an
ass
that
is
worth
my
master
's
horse
twice
*NL*
over
;
God
send
me
a
bad
Easter
,
and
that
the
next
one
I
am
to
see
,
if
I
*NL*
would
swap
,
even
if
I
got
four
bushels
of
barley
to
boot
.
You
will
laugh
*NL*
at
the
value
I
put
on
my
Dapple
--
for
dapple
is
the
colour
of
my
beast
.
As
*NL*
to
greyhounds
,
I
ca
n't
want
for
them
,
for
there
are
enough

to
spare
*NL*
in
my
town
;
and
,
moreover
,
there
is
more
pleasure
in
sport
when
it
is
at
*NL*
other
people
's
expense

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
and
earnest
,
sir
squire

said
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
I
have
made
up
*NL*
my
mind

determined

done
with
these
drunken
vagaries
of
these
*NL*
knights
,

go
back
to
my
village

bring
up
my
children

three

like
three
Oriental
pearls

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Sancho

*NL*
``
And
how
old
is
this

is
being
bred
up

asked
he
*NL*
of
the
Grove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen

a
couple
of
years
more

less

answered
Sancho
;

as
tall
as
a
lance

as
fresh
as
an
April
morning

strong
as
a
*NL*
porter

*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
are
gifts

fit

be
not

he
of
the
Grove

what
pith
the
rogue

must
have

*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
made
answer

somewhat
sulkily
,
``
She

no
strumpet

was
her
mother

nor
will
either
of

God
,
while
I
live

*NL*
speak
more
civilly
;
for
one
bred
up
among
knights-errant
,
who
are
*NL*
courtesy
itself

your
words
do
n't
seem
to
me
to
be
very
becoming

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
how
little
you
know
about
compliments

sir
squire

returned
he
of
the
*NL*
Grove
.
``
What
!
do
n't
you
know
that
when
a
horseman
delivers
a
good
lance

thrust
at
the
bull
in
the
plaza
,
or
when
anyone
does
anything
very
well
,
*NL*
the
people
are
wont
to
say
,
`
Ha

well
he
has
done

*NL*
and
that
what
seems
to
be
abuse
in
the
expression
is
high
praise

Disown
*NL*
sons
and
daughters
,
senor
,
who
do
n't
do
what
deserves
that
compliments
of
*NL*
this
sort
should
be
paid
to
their
parents

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
disown
them

replied
Sancho
,
``
and
in
this
way
,
and
by
the
same
*NL*
reasoning

you
might
call
me

my
children

wife
all
the
*NL*
strumpets
in
the
world
,
for
all
they
do
and
say
is
of
a
kind
that
in
the
*NL*
highest
degree
deserves
the
same
praise
;
and
to
see
them
again
I
pray
God
*NL*
to
deliver
me
from
mortal
sin
,
or
,
what
comes
to
the

thing

to
*NL*
deliver
me
from
this
perilous
calling
of
squire
into
which
I
have
fallen
*NL*
a
second
time
,
decayed
and
beguiled
by
a
purse
with
a
hundred
ducats
that
*NL*
I
found
one
day
in
the
heart
of
the
Sierra
Morena

always
putting

full
of
doubloons

fancy
at

I
am
putting
my
hand
on
it

hugging
it

carrying
it
home
with
me
,
and
making
investments

*NL*
getting
interest
,

living
like
a
prince
;

so
long
as
I
think
of
*NL*
this
I
make
light
of
all
the
hardships
I
endure
with
this
simpleton
of
a
*NL*
master
of
mine

who
,
I
well
know

is
more
of
a
madman

a
knight

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
why
they
say
that

bursts
the
bag

said
he
of
the
*NL*
Grove
;
``
but
if
you
come
to
talk
of
that
sort

there
is
not
a
greater
one

my
master

he
is
one
of
those
of

they
say

cares

others
kill
the
ass

for
,
in
order
that
another
knight
may
*NL*
recover
the
senses
he
has
lost

he
makes
a
madman
of
himself

goes

looking

that
rawness

of
the
Grove
,
``
and
more
roguish
than
*NL*
crazy
or
valiant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
is
not
that
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
mean
he
has
nothing
of
the
rogue
in
*NL*
him
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
has
the
soul
of
a
pitcher
;
he
has
no
thought
of
*NL*
doing
harm
to
anyone
,
only
good
to
all
,
nor
has
he
any
malice
whatever
in
*NL*
him
;
a
child
might
persuade
him
that
it
is
night
at
noonday
;
and
for
this
*NL*
simplicity
I
love
him
as
the
core
of
my
heart
,
and
I
ca
n't
bring
myself
*NL*
to
leave
him
,
let
him
do
ever
such
foolish
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
brother
and
senor
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
if
the
blind
*NL*
lead
the
blind
,
both
are
in
danger
of
falling
into
the
pit
.
It
is
better
*NL*
for
us
to
beat
a
quiet
retreat
and
get
back
to
our
own
quarters
;
for
*NL*
those
who
seek
adventures
do
n't
always
find
good
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
kept
spitting
from
time
to
time
,
and
his
spittle
seemed
somewhat
*NL*
ropy
and
dry
,
observing
which
the
compassionate
squire
of
the
Grove
said
,
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
that
with
all
this
talk
of
ours
our
tongues
are
sticking
*NL*
to
the
roofs
of
our
mouths
;
but
I
have
a
pretty
good
loosener
hanging
*NL*
from
the
saddle-bow
of
my
horse
,
''
and
getting
up
he
came
back
the
next
*NL*
minute
with
a
large
bota
of
wine
and
a
pasty
half
a
yard
across
;
and
this
*NL*
is
no
exaggeration
,
for
it
was
made
of
a
house
rabbit
so
big
that
Sancho
,
*NL*
as
he
handled
it
,
took
it
to
be
made
of
a
goat
,
not
to
say
a
kid
,
and
*NL*
looking
at
it
he
said
,
``
And
do
you
carry
this
with
you
,
senor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
are
you
thinking
about
?
''
said
the
other
;
``
do
you
take
me
for
*NL*
some
paltry
squire
?
I
carry
a
better
larder
on
my
horse
's
croup
than
a
*NL*
general
takes
with
him
when
he
goes
on
a
march
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
ate
without
requiring
to
be
pressed
,
and
in
the
dark
bolted
*NL*
mouthfuls
like
the
knots
on
a
tether
,
and
said
he
,
``
You
are
a
proper
*NL*
trusty
squire
,
one
of
the
right
sort
,
sumptuous
and
grand
,
as
this
*NL*
banquet
shows
,
which
,
if
it
has
not
come
here
by
magic
art
,
at
any
rate
*NL*
has
the
look
of
it
;
not
like
me
,
unlucky
beggar
,
that
have
nothing
more
*NL*
in
my
alforjas
than
a
scrap
of
cheese
,
so
hard
that
one
might
brain
a
*NL*
giant
with
it
,
and
,
to
keep
it
company
,
a
few
dozen
carobs
and
as
many
*NL*
more
filberts
and
walnuts
;
thanks
to
the
austerity
of
my
master
,
and
the
*NL*
idea
he
has
and
the
rule
he
follows
,
that
knights-errant
must
not
live
or
*NL*
sustain
themselves
on
anything
except
dried
fruits
and
the
herbs
of
the
*NL*
field
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
faith
,
brother
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
my
stomach
is
not
made
for
*NL*
thistles
,
or
wild
pears
,
or
roots
of

let
our
masters
do
as
*NL*
they
like
,
with
their
chivalry
notions
and
laws
,
and
eat
what
those
*NL*
enjoin
;
I
carry
my
prog-basket
and
this
bota
hanging
to
the
saddle-bow
,
*NL*
whatever
they
may
say
;
and
it
is
such
an
object
of
worship
with
me
,
and
I
*NL*
love
it
so
,
that
there
is
hardly
a
moment
but
I
am
kissing
and
embracing
*NL*
it
over
and
over
again
;
''
and
so
saying
he
thrust
it
into
Sancho
's
hands
,
*NL*
who
raising
it
aloft
pointed
to
his
mouth
,
gazed
at
the
stars
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
when
he
had
done
drinking
let
his
head
fall
on
*NL*
one
side
,
and
giving
a
deep
sigh
,
exclaimed
,
``
Ah
,
whoreson
rogue
,
how
*NL*
catholic
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
,
hearing
Sancho
's
exclamation
,
*NL*
``
how
you
have
called
this
wine
whoreson
by
way
of
praise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
own
it
,
and
I
grant
it
is
no
dishonour
to
call
*NL*
anyone
whoreson
when
it
is
to
be
understood
as
praise
.
But
tell
me
,
*NL*
senor
,
by
what
you
love
best
,
is
this
Ciudad
Real
wine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
rare
wine-taster
!
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
;
``
nowhere
else
indeed
does
it
*NL*
come
from
,
and
it
has
some
years
'
age
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
alone
for
that
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
never
fear
but
I
'll
hit
upon
the
*NL*
place
it
came
from
somehow
.
What
would
you
say
,
sir
squire
,
to
my
having
*NL*
such
a
great
natural
instinct
in
judging
wines
that
you
have
only
to
let
*NL*
me
smell
one
and
I
can
tell
positively
its
country
,
its
kind
,
its
flavour
*NL*
and
soundness
,
the
changes
it
will
undergo
,
and
everything
that
*NL*
appertains
to
a
wine
?
But
it
is
no
wonder
,
for
I
have
had
in
my
family
,
*NL*
on
my
father
's
side
,
the
two
best
wine-tasters
that
have
been
known
in
La
*NL*
Mancha
for
many
a
long
year
,
and
to
prove
it
I
'll
tell
you
now
a
thing
*NL*
that
happened
them
.
They
gave
the
two
of
them
some
wine
out
of
a
cask
,
to
*NL*
try
,
asking
their
opinion
as
to
the
condition
,
quality
,
goodness
or
*NL*
badness
of
the
wine
.
One
of
them
tried
it
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
,
the
*NL*
other
did
no
more
than
bring
it
to
his
nose
.
The
first
said
the
wine
had
*NL*
a
flavour
of
iron
,
the
second
said
it
had
a
stronger
flavour
of
cordovan
.
*NL*
The
owner
said
the
cask
was
clean
,
and
that
nothing
had
been
added
to
the
*NL*
wine
from
which
it
could
have
got
a
flavour
of
either
iron
or
leather
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
these
two
great
wine-tasters
held
to
what
they
had
said
.
*NL*
Time
went
by
,
the
wine
was
sold
,
and
when
they
came
to
clean
out
the
*NL*
cask
,
they
found
in
it
a
small
key
hanging
to
a
thong
of
cordovan
;
see
*NL*
now
if
one
who
comes
of
the
same
stock
has
not
a
right
to
give
his
*NL*
opinion
in
such
like
cases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
,
I
say
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
let
us
give
up
going
in
quest
*NL*
of
adventures
,
and
as
we
have
loaves
let
us
not
go
looking
for
cakes
,
but
*NL*
return
to
our
cribs
,
for
God
will
find
us
there
if
it
be
his
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Until
my
master
reaches
Saragossa
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
'll
remain
in
his
*NL*
service
;
after
that
we
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
end
of
it
was
that
the
two
squires
talked
so
much
and
drank
so
much
*NL*
that
sleep
had
to
tie
their
tongues
and
moderate
their
thirst
,
for
to
*NL*
quench
it
was
impossible
;
and
so
the
pair
of
them
fell
asleep
clinging
to
*NL*
the
now
nearly
empty
bota
and
with
half-chewed
morsels
in
their
mouths
;
*NL*
and
there
we
will
leave
them
for
the
present
,
to
relate
what
passed
*NL*
between
the
Knight
of
the
Grove
and
him
of
the
Rueful
Countenance

CHAPTER
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
CONTINUED
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
KNIGHT
OF
THE
GROVE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
things
that
passed
between
Don
Quixote
and
the
Knight
of
the
*NL*
Wood
,
the
history
tells
us
he
of
the
Grove
said
to
Don
Quixote
,
``
In
fine
,
*NL*
sir
knight
,
I
would
have
you
know
that
my
destiny
,
or
,
more
properly
*NL*
speaking
,
my
choice
led
me
to
fall
in
love
with
the
peerless
Casildea
de
*NL*
Vandalia
.
I
call
her
peerless
because
she
has
no
peer
,
whether
it
be
in
*NL*
bodily
stature
or
in
the
supremacy
of
rank
and
beauty
.
This
same
*NL*
Casildea
,
then
,
that
I
speak
of
,
requited
my
honourable
passion
and
*NL*
gentle
aspirations
by
compelling
me
,
as
his
stepmother
did
Hercules
,
to
*NL*
engage
in
many
perils
of
various
sorts
,
at
the
end
of
each
promising
me
*NL*
that
,
with
the
end
of
the
next
,
the
object
of
my
hopes
should
be
*NL*
attained
;
but
my
labours
have
gone
on
increasing
link
by
link
until
they
*NL*
are
past
counting
,
nor
do
I
know
what
will
be
the
last
one
that
is
to
be
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the
accomplishment
of
my
chaste
desires
.
On
one
occasion
*NL*
she
bade
me
go
and
challenge
the
famous
giantess
of
Seville
,
La
Giralda
*NL*
by
name
,
who
is
as
mighty
and
strong
as
if
made
of
brass
,
and
though
*NL*
never
stirring
from
one
spot
,
is
the
most
restless
and
changeable
woman
*NL*
in
the
world
.
I
came
,
I
saw
,
I
conquered
,
and
I
made
her
stay
quiet
and
*NL*
behave
herself
,
for
nothing
but
north
winds
blew
for
more
than
a
week
.
*NL*
Another
time
I
was
ordered
to
lift
those
ancient
stones
,
the
mighty
bulls
*NL*
of
Guisando
,
an
enterprise
that
might
more
fitly
be
entrusted
to
porters
*NL*
than
to
knights
.
Again
,
she
bade
me
fling
myself
into
the
cavern
of
*NL*
Cabra
--
an
unparalleled
and
awful
peril
--
and
bring
her
a
minute
account
of
*NL*
all
that
is
concealed
in
those
gloomy
depths
.
I
stopped
the
motion
of
the
*NL*
Giralda
,
I
lifted
the
bulls
of
Guisando
,
I
flung
myself
into
the
cavern
*NL*
and
brought
to
light
the
secrets
of
its
abyss
;
and
my
hopes
are
as
dead
*NL*
as
dead
can
be
,
and
her
scorn
and
her
commands
as
lively
as
ever
.
To
be
*NL*
brief
,
last
of
all
she
has
commanded
me
to
go
through
all
the
provinces
*NL*
of
Spain
and
compel
all
the
knights-errant
wandering
therein
to
confess
*NL*
that
she
surpasses
all
women
alive
to-day
in
beauty
,
and
that
I
am
the
*NL*
most
valiant
and
the
most
deeply
enamoured
knight
on
earth
;
in
support
of
*NL*
which
claim
I
have
already
travelled
over
the
greater
part
of
Spain
,
and
*NL*
have
there
vanquished
several
knights
who
have
dared
to
contradict
me
;
*NL*
but
what
I
most
plume
and
pride
myself
upon
is
having
vanquished
in
*NL*
single
combat
that
so
famous
knight
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
and
made
*NL*
him
confess
that
my
Casildea
is
more
beautiful
than
his
Dulcinea
;
and
in
*NL*
this
one
victory
I
hold
myself
to
have
conquered
all
the
knights
in
the
*NL*
world
;
for
this
Don
Quixote
that
I
speak
of
has
vanquished
them
all
,
and
*NL*
I
having
vanquished
him
,
his
glory
,
his
fame
,
and
his
honour
have
passed
*NL*
and
are
transferred
to
my
person
;
for
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
the
vanquished
hath
of
fair
renown
,
*NL*
The
greater
glory
gilds
the
victor
's
crown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
innumerable
achievements
of
the
said
Don
Quixote
are
now
set
*NL*
down
to
my
account
and
have
become
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
amazed
when
he
heard
the
Knight
of
the
Grove
,
and
was
a
*NL*
thousand
times
on
the
point
of
telling
him
he
lied
,
and
had
the
lie
*NL*
direct
already
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
;
but
he
restrained
himself
as
*NL*
well
as
he
could
,
in
order
to
force
him
to
confess
the
lie
with
his
own
*NL*
lips
;
so
he
said
to
him
quietly
,
``
As
to
what
you
say
,
sir
knight
,
about
*NL*
having
vanquished
most
of
the
knights
of
Spain
,
or
even
of
the
whole
*NL*
world
,
I
say
nothing
;
but
that
you
have
vanquished
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
I
consider
doubtful
;
it
may
have
been
some
other
that
resembled
*NL*
him
,
although
there
are
few
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
not
vanquished
?
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
;
``
by
the
heaven
that
is
above
*NL*
us
I
fought
Don
Quixote
and
overcame
him
and
made
him
yield
;
and
he
is
a
*NL*
man
of
tall
stature
,
gaunt
features
,
long
,
lank
limbs
,
with
hair
turning
*NL*
grey
,
an
aquiline
nose
rather
hooked
,
and
large
black
drooping
*NL*
moustaches
;
he
does
battle
under
the
name
of
`
The
Countenance
,
'
and
he
*NL*
has
for
squire
a
peasant
called
Sancho
Panza
;
he
presses
the
loins
and
*NL*
rules
the
reins
of
a
famous
steed
called
Rocinante
;
and
lastly
,
he
has
*NL*
for
the
mistress
of
his
will
a
certain
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
once
upon
a
*NL*
time
called
Aldonza
Lorenzo
,
just
as
I
call
mine
Casildea
de
Vandalia
*NL*
because
her
name
is
Casilda
and
she
is
of
Andalusia
.
If
all
these
tokens
*NL*
are
not
enough
to
vindicate
the
truth
of
what
I
say
,
here
is
my
sword
,
*NL*
that
will
compel
incredulity
itself
to
give
credence
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm
yourself
,
sir
knight
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
give
ear
to
what
I
am
*NL*
about
to
say
to
you
.
I
would
have
you
know
that
this
Don
Quixote
you
*NL*
speak
of
is
the
greatest
friend
I
have
in
the
world
;
so
much
so
that
I
*NL*
may
say
I
regard
him
in
the
same
light
as
my
own
person
;
and
from
the
*NL*
precise
and
clear
indications
you
have
given
I
can
not
but
think
that
he
*NL*
must
be
the
very
one
you
have
vanquished
.
On
the
other
hand
,
I
see
with
*NL*
my
eyes
and
feel
with
my
hands
that
it
is
impossible
it
can
have
been
the
*NL*
same
;
unless
indeed
it
be
that
,
as
he
has
many
enemies
who
are
*NL*
enchanters
,
and
one
in
particular
who
is
always
persecuting
him
,
some
one
*NL*
of
these
may
have
taken
his
shape
in
order
to
allow
himself
to
be
*NL*
vanquished
,
so
as
to
defraud
him
of
the
fame
that
his
exalted
*NL*
achievements
as
a
knight
have
earned
and
acquired
for
him
throughout
the
*NL*
known
world
.
And
in
confirmation
of
this
,
I
must
tell
you
,
too
,
that
it
*NL*
is
but
ten
hours
since
these
said
enchanters
his
enemies
transformed
the
*NL*
shape
and
person
of
the
fair
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
into
a
foul
and
mean
*NL*
village
lass
,
and
in
the
same
way
they
must
have
transformed
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
and
if
all
this
does
not
suffice
to
convince
you
of
the
truth
of
what
I
*NL*
say
,
here
is
Don
Quixote
himself
,
who
will
maintain
it
by
arms
,
on
foot
*NL*
or
on
horseback
or
in
any
way
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
saying
he
stood
up
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
sword
,
waiting
to
see
*NL*
what
the
Knight
of
the
Grove
would
do
,
who
in
an
equally
calm
voice
said
*NL*
in
reply
,
``
Pledges
do
n't
distress
a
good
payer
;
he
who
has
succeeded
in
*NL*
vanquishing
you
once
when
transformed
,
Sir
Don
Quixote
,
may
fairly
hope
*NL*
to
subdue
you
in
your
own
proper
shape
;
but
as
it
is
not
becoming
for
*NL*
knights
to
perform
their
feats
of
arms
in
the
dark
,
like
highwaymen
and
*NL*
bullies
,
let
us
wait
till
daylight
,
that
the
sun
may
behold
our
deeds
;
*NL*
and
the
conditions
of
our
combat
shall
be
that
the
vanquished
shall
be
at
*NL*
the
victor
's
disposal
,
to
do
all
that
he
may
enjoin
,
provided
the
*NL*
injunction
be
such
as
shall
be
becoming
a
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
more
than
satisfied
with
these
conditions
and
terms
,
''
replied
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
and
so
saying
,
they
betook
themselves
to
where
their
squires
*NL*
lay
,
and
found
them
snoring
,
and
in
the
same
posture
they
were
in
when
*NL*
sleep
fell
upon
them
.
They
roused
them
up
,
and
bade
them
get
the
horses
*NL*
ready
,
as
at
sunrise
they
were
to
engage
in
a
bloody
and
arduous
single
*NL*
combat
;
at
which
intelligence
Sancho
was
aghast
and
thunderstruck
,
*NL*
trembling
for
the
safety
of
his
master
because
of
the
mighty
deeds
he
had
*NL*
heard
the
squire
of
the
Grove
ascribe
to
his
;
but
without
a
word
the
two
*NL*
squires
went
in
quest
of
their
cattle
;
for
by
this
time
the
three
horses
*NL*
and
the
ass
had
smelt
one
another
out
,
and
were
all
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
,
he
of
the
Grove
said
to
Sancho
,
``
You
must
know
,
brother
,
that
*NL*
it
is
the
custom
with
the
fighting
men
of
Andalusia
,
when
they
are
*NL*
godfathers
in
any
quarrel
,
not
to
stand
idle
with
folded
arms
while
their
*NL*
godsons
fight
;
I
say
so
to
remind
you
that
while
our
masters
are
*NL*
fighting
,
we
,
too
,
have
to
fight
,
and
knock
one
another
to
shivers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
custom
,
sir
squire
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
may
hold
good
among
those
*NL*
bullies
and
fighting
men
you
talk
of
,
but
certainly
not
among
the
squires
*NL*
of
knights-errant
;
at
least
,
I
have
never
heard
my
master
speak
of
any
*NL*
custom
of
the
sort
,
and
he
knows
all
the
laws
of
knight-errantry
by
*NL*
heart
;
but
granting
it
true
that
there
is
an
express
law
that
squires
are
*NL*
to
fight
while
their
masters
are
fighting
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
obey
it
,
but
*NL*
to
pay
the
penalty
that
may
be
laid
on
peacefully
minded
squires
like
*NL*
myself
;
for
I
am
sure
it
can
not
be
more
than
two
pounds
of
wax
,
and
I
*NL*
would
rather
pay
that
,
for
I
know
it
will
cost
me
less
than
the
lint
I
*NL*
shall
be
at
the
expense
of
to
mend
my
head
,
which
I
look
upon
as
broken
*NL*
and
split
already
;
there
's
another
thing
that
makes
it
impossible
for
me
*NL*
to
fight
,
that
I
have
no
sword
,
for
I
never
carried
one
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
a
good
remedy
for
that
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
;
``
I
have
here
two
*NL*
linen
bags
of
the
same
size
;
you
shall
take
one
,
and
I
the
other
,
and
we
*NL*
will
fight
at
bag
blows
with
equal
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
's
the
way
,
so
be
it
with
all
my
heart
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
that
*NL*
sort
of
battle
will
serve
to
knock
the
dust
out
of
us
instead
of
hurting
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
not
do
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
for
we
must
put
into
the
bags
,
to
*NL*
keep
the
wind
from
blowing
them
away
,
half
a
dozen
nice
smooth
pebbles
,
*NL*
all
of
the
same
weight
;
and
in
this
way
we
shall
be
able
to
baste
one
*NL*
another
without
doing
ourselves
any
harm
or
mischief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Body
of
my
father
!
''
said
Sancho
,
``
see
what
marten
and
sable
,
and
pads
of
*NL*
carded
cotton
he
is
putting
into
the
bags
,
that
our
heads
may
not
be
*NL*
broken
and
our
bones
beaten
to
jelly
!
But
even
if
they
are
filled
with
*NL*
toss
silk
,
I
can
tell
you
,
senor
,
I
am
not
going
to
fight
;
let
our
*NL*
masters
fight
,
that
's
their
lookout
,
and
let
us
drink
and
live
;
for
time
*NL*
will
take
care
to
ease
us
of
our
lives
,
without
our
going
to
look
for
*NL*
fillips
so
that
they
may
be
finished
off
before
their
proper
time
comes
*NL*
and
they
drop
from
ripeness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
returned
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
we
must
fight
,
if
it
be
only
for
half
*NL*
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
am
not
going
to
be
so
discourteous
or
so
*NL*
ungrateful
as
to
have
any
quarrel
,
be
it
ever
so
small
,
with
one
I
have
*NL*
eaten
and
drunk
with
;
besides
,
who
the
devil
could
bring
himself
to
fight
*NL*
in
cold
blood
,
without
anger
or
provocation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
remedy
that
entirely
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
,
``
and
in
this
way
:
*NL*
before
we
begin
the
battle
,
I
will
come
up
to
your
worship
fair
and
*NL*
softly
,
and
give
you
three
or
four
buffets
,
with
which
I
shall
stretch
*NL*
you
at
my
feet
and
rouse
your
anger
,
though
it
were
sleeping
sounder
than
*NL*
a
dormouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
match
that
plan
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
have
another
that
is
not
a
whit
*NL*
behind
it
;
I
will
take
a
cudgel
,
and
before
your
worship
comes
near
*NL*
enough
to
waken
my
anger
I
will
send
yours
so
sound
to
sleep
with
whacks
,
*NL*
that
it
wo
n't
waken
unless
it
be
in
the
other
world
,
where
it
is
known
*NL*
that
I
am
not
a
man
to
let
my
face
be
handled
by
anyone
;
let
each
look
*NL*
out
for
the
arrow
--
though
the
surer
way
would
be
to
let
everyone
's
anger
*NL*
sleep
,
for
nobody
knows
the
heart
of
anyone
,
and
a
man
may
come
for
wool
*NL*
and
go
back
shorn
;
God
gave
his
blessing
to
peace
and
his
curse
to
*NL*
quarrels
;
if
a
hunted
cat
,
surrounded
and
hard
pressed
,
turns
into
a
*NL*
lion
,
God
knows
what
I
,
who
am
a
man
,
may
turn
into
;
and
so
from
this
*NL*
time
forth
I
warn
you
,
sir
squire
,
that
all
the
harm
and
mischief
that
*NL*
may
come
of
our
quarrel
will
be
put
down
to
your
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
he
of
the
Grove
;
``
God
will
send
the
dawn
and
we
shall
*NL*
be
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
gay-plumaged
birds
of
all
sorts
began
to
warble
in
the
trees
,
and
*NL*
with
their
varied
and
gladsome
notes
seemed
to
welcome
and
salute
the
*NL*
fresh
morn
that
was
beginning
to
show
the
beauty
of
her
countenance
at
*NL*
the
gates
and
balconies
of
the
east
,
shaking
from
her
locks
a
profusion
*NL*
of
liquid
pearls
;
in
which
dulcet
moisture
bathed
,
the
plants
,
too
,
*NL*
seemed
to
shed
and
shower
down
a
pearly
spray
,
the
willows
distilled
*NL*
sweet
manna
,
the
fountains
laughed
,
the
brooks
babbled
,
the
woods
*NL*
rejoiced
,
and
the
meadows
arrayed
themselves
in
all
their
glory
at
her
*NL*
coming
.
But
hardly
had
the
light
of
day
made
it
possible
to
see
and
*NL*
distinguish
things
,
when
the
first
object
that
presented
itself
to
the
*NL*
eyes
of
Sancho
Panza
was
the
squire
of
the
Grove
's
nose
,
which
was
so
big
*NL*
that
it
almost
overshadowed
his
whole
body
.
It
is
,
in
fact
,
stated
,
that
*NL*
it
was
of
enormous
size
,
hooked
in
the
middle
,
covered
with
warts
,
and
of
*NL*
a
mulberry
colour
like
an
egg-plant
;
it
hung
down
two
fingers
'
length
*NL*
below
his
mouth
,
and
the
size
,
the
colour
,
the
warts
,
and
the
bend
of
it
,
*NL*
made
his
face
so
hideous
,
that
Sancho
,
as
he
looked
at
him
,
began
to
*NL*
tremble
hand
and
foot
like
a
child
in
convulsions
,
and
he
vowed
in
his
*NL*
heart
to
let
himself
be
given
two
hundred
buffets
,
sooner
than
be
*NL*
provoked
to
fight
that
monster
.
Don
Quixote
examined
his
adversary
,
and
*NL*
found
that
he
already
had
his
helmet
on
and
visor
lowered
,
so
that
he
*NL*
could
not
see
his
face
;
he
observed
,
however
,
that
he
was
a
sturdily
*NL*
built
man
,
but
not
very
tall
in
stature
.
Over
his
armour
he
wore
a
*NL*
surcoat
or
cassock
of
what
seemed
to
be
the
finest
cloth
of
gold
,
all
*NL*
bespangled
with
glittering
mirrors
like
little
moons
,
which
gave
him
an
*NL*
extremely
gallant
and
splendid
appearance
;
above
his
helmet
fluttered
a
*NL*
great
quantity
of
plumes
,
green
,
yellow
,
and
white
,
and
his
lance
,
which
*NL*
was
leaning
against
a
tree
,
was
very
long
and
stout
,
and
had
a
steel
*NL*
point
more
than
a
palm
in
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
observed
all
,
and
took
note
of
all
,
and
from
what
he
saw
and
*NL*
observed
he
concluded
that
the
said
knight
must
be
a
man
of
great
*NL*
strength
,
but
he
did
not
for
all
that
give
way
to
fear
,
like
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
;
on
the
contrary
,
with
a
composed
and
dauntless
air
,
he
said
to
the
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Mirrors
,
``
If
,
sir
knight
,
your
great
eagerness
to
fight
has
*NL*
not
banished
your
courtesy
,
by
it
I
would
entreat
you
to
raise
your
visor
*NL*
a
little
,
in
order
that
I
may
see
if
the
comeliness
of
your
countenance
*NL*
corresponds
with
that
of
your
equipment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
you
come
victorious
or
vanquished
out
of
this
emprise
,
sir
*NL*
knight
,
''
replied
he
of
the
Mirrors
,
``
you
will
have
more
than
enough
time
*NL*
and
leisure
to
see
me
;
and
if
now
I
do
not
comply
with
your
request
,
it
*NL*
is
because
it
seems
to
me
I
should
do
a
serious
wrong
to
the
fair
*NL*
Casildea
de
Vandalia
in
wasting
time
while
I
stopped
to
raise
my
visor
*NL*
before
compelling
you
to
confess
what
you
are
already
aware
I
maintain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
while
we
are
mounting
you
can
at
least
*NL*
tell
me
if
I
am
that
Don
Quixote
whom
you
said
you
vanquished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
that
we
answer
you
,
''
said
he
of
the
Mirrors
,
``
that
you
are
as
like
*NL*
the
very
knight
I
vanquished
as
one
egg
is
like
another
,
but
as
you
say
*NL*
enchanters
persecute
you
,
I
will
not
venture
to
say
positively
whether
*NL*
you
are
the
said
person
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
is
enough
to
convince
me
that
you
are
under
a
*NL*
deception
;
however
,
entirely
to
relieve
you
of
it
,
let
our
horses
be
*NL*
brought
,
and
in
less
time
than
it
would
take
you
to
raise
your
visor
,
if
*NL*
God
,
my
lady
,
and
my
arm
stand
me
in
good
stead
,
I
shall
see
your
face
,
*NL*
and
you
shall
see
that
I
am
not
the
vanquished
Don
Quixote
you
take
me
to
*NL*
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
,
cutting
short
the
colloquy
,
they
mounted
,
and
Don
Quixote
*NL*
wheeled
Rocinante
round
in
order
to
take
a
proper
distance
to
charge
back
*NL*
upon
his
adversary
,
and
he
of
the
Mirrors
did
the
same
;
but
Don
Quixote
*NL*
had
not
moved
away
twenty
paces
when
he
heard
himself
called
by
the
*NL*
other
,
and
,
each
returning
half-way
,
he
of
the
Mirrors
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Remember
,
sir
knight
,
that
the
terms
of
our
combat
are
,
that
the
*NL*
vanquished
,
as
I
said
before
,
shall
be
at
the
victor
's
disposal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
aware
of
it
already
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
provided
what
is
commanded
*NL*
and
imposed
upon
the
vanquished
be
things
that
do
not
transgress
the
*NL*
limits
of
chivalry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
understood
,
''
replied
he
of
the
Mirrors
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
extraordinary
nose
of
the
squire
presented
itself
to
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
view
,
and
he
was
no
less
amazed
than
Sancho
at
the
sight
;
*NL*
insomuch
that
he
set
him
down
as
a
monster
of
some
kind
,
or
a
human
being
*NL*
of
some
new
species
or
unearthly
breed
.
Sancho
,
seeing
his
master
*NL*
retiring
to
run
his
course
,
did
not
like
to
be
left
alone
with
the
nosy
*NL*
man
,
fearing
that
with
one
flap
of
that
nose
on
his
own
the
battle
would
*NL*
be
all
over
for
him
and
he
would
be
left
stretched
on
the
ground
,
either
*NL*
by
the
blow
or
with
fright
;
so
he
ran
after
his
master
,
holding
on
to
*NL*
Rocinante
's
stirrup-leather
,
and
when
it
seemed
to
him
time
to
turn
*NL*
about
,
he
said
,
``
I
implore
of
your
worship
,
senor
,
before
you
turn
to
*NL*
charge
,
to
help
me
up
into
this
cork
tree
,
from
which
I
will
be
able
to
*NL*
witness
the
gallant
encounter
your
worship
is
going
to
have
with
this
*NL*
knight
,
more
to
my
taste
and
better
than
from
the
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
rather
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
thou
wouldst
*NL*
mount
a
scaffold
in
order
to
see
the
bulls
without
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
the
truth
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
the
monstrous
nose
of
that
squire
*NL*
has
filled
me
with
fear
and
terror
,
and
I
dare
not
stay
near
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
such
a
one
that
were
I
not
what
I
am
it
would
*NL*
terrify
me
too
;
so
,
come
,
I
will
help
thee
up
where
thou
wilt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Don
Quixote
waited
for
Sancho
to
mount
into
the
cork
tree
he
of
the
*NL*
Mirrors
took
as
much
ground
as
he
considered
requisite
,
and
,
supposing
*NL*
Don
Quixote
to
have
done
the
same
,
without
waiting
for
any
sound
of
*NL*
trumpet
or
other
signal
to
direct
them
,
he
wheeled
his
horse
,
which
was
*NL*
not
more
agile
or
better-looking
than
Rocinante
,
and
at
his
top
speed
,
*NL*
which
was
an
easy
trot
,
he
proceeded
to
charge
his
enemy
;
seeing
him
,
*NL*
however
,
engaged
in
putting
Sancho
up
,
he
drew
rein
,
and
halted
in
mid
*NL*
career
,
for
which
his
horse
was
very
grateful
,
as
he
was
already
unable
*NL*
to
go
.
Don
Quixote
,
fancying
that
his
foe
was
coming
down
upon
him
*NL*
flying
,
drove
his
spurs
vigorously
into
Rocinante
's
lean
flanks
and
made
*NL*
him
scud
along
in
such
style
that
the
history
tells
us
that
on
this
*NL*
occasion
only
was
he
known
to
make
something
like
running
,
for
on
all
*NL*
others
it
was
a
simple
trot
with
him
;
and
with
this
unparalleled
fury
he
*NL*
bore
down
where
he
of
the
Mirrors
stood
digging
his
spurs
into
his
horse
*NL*
up
to
buttons
,
without
being
able
to
make
him
stir
a
finger
's
length
from
*NL*
the
spot
where
he
had
come
to
a
standstill
in
his
course
.
At
this
lucky
*NL*
moment
and
crisis
,
Don
Quixote
came
upon
his
adversary
,
in
trouble
with
*NL*
his
horse
,
and
embarrassed
with
his
lance
,
which
he
either
could
not
*NL*
manage
,
or
had
no
time
to
lay
in
rest
.
Don
Quixote
,
however
,
paid
no
*NL*
attention
to
these
difficulties
,
and
in
perfect
safety
to
himself
and
*NL*
without
any
risk
encountered
him
of
the
Mirrors
with
such
force
that
he
*NL*
brought
him
to
the
ground
in
spite
of
himself
over
the
haunches
of
his
*NL*
horse
,
and
with
so
heavy
a
fall
that
he
lay
to
all
appearance
dead
,
not
*NL*
stirring
hand
or
foot
.
The
instant
Sancho
saw
him
fall
he
slid
down
from
*NL*
the
cork
tree
,
and
made
all
haste
to
where
his
master
was
,
who
,
*NL*
dismounting
from
Rocinante
,
went
and
stood
over
him
of
the
Mirrors
,
and
*NL*
unlacing
his
helmet
to
see
if
he
was
dead
,
and
to
give
him
air
if
he
*NL*
should
happen
to
be
alive
,
he
saw
--
who
can
say
what
he
saw
,
without
*NL*
filling
all
who
hear
it
with
astonishment
,
wonder
,
and
awe
?
He
saw
,
the
*NL*
history
says
,
the
very
countenance
,
the
very
face
,
the
very
look
,
the
*NL*
very
physiognomy
,
the
very
effigy
,
the
very
image
of
the
bachelor
Samson
*NL*
Carrasco
!
As
soon
as
he
saw
it
he
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
,
``
Make
haste
*NL*
here
,
Sancho
,
and
behold
what
thou
art
to
see
but
not
to
believe
;
quick
,
*NL*
my
son
,
and
learn
what
magic
can
do
,
and
wizards
and
enchanters
are
*NL*
capable
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
came
up
,
and
when
he
saw
the
countenance
of
the
bachelor
Carrasco
,
*NL*
he
fell
to
crossing
himself
a
thousand
times
,
and
blessing
himself
as
*NL*
many
more
.
All
this
time
the
prostrate
knight
showed
no
signs
of
life
,
*NL*
and
Sancho
said
to
Don
Quixote
,
``
It
is
my
opinion
,
senor
,
that
in
any
*NL*
case
your
worship
should
take
and
thrust
your
sword
into
the
mouth
of
*NL*
this
one
here
that
looks
like
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
;
perhaps
in
*NL*
him
you
will
kill
one
of
your
enemies
,
the
enchanters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
advice
is
not
bad
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
of
enemies
the
fewer
the
*NL*
better
;
''
and
he
was
drawing
his
sword
to
carry
into
effect
Sancho
's
*NL*
counsel
and
suggestion
,
when
the
squire
of
the
Mirrors
came
up
,
now
*NL*
without
the
nose
which
had
made
him
so
hideous
,
and
cried
out
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
,
``
Mind
what
you
are
about
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
;
that
is
your
friend
,
*NL*
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
,
you
have
at
your
feet
,
and
I
am
his
*NL*
squire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
nose
?
''
said
Sancho
,
seeing
him
without
the
hideous
feature
he
*NL*
had
before
;
to
which
he
replied
,
``
I
have
it
here
in
my
pocket
,
''
and
*NL*
putting
his
hand
into
his
right
pocket
,
he
pulled
out
a
masquerade
nose
*NL*
of
varnished
pasteboard
of
the
make
already
described
;
and
Sancho
,
*NL*
examining
him
more
and
more
closely
,
exclaimed
aloud
in
a
voice
of
*NL*
amazement
,
``
Holy
Mary
be
good
to
me
!
Is
n't
it
Tom
Cecial
,
my
neighbour
*NL*
and
gossip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
be
sure
I
am
!
''
returned
the
now
unnosed
squire
;
``
Tom
Cecial
I
*NL*
am
,
gossip
and
friend
Sancho
Panza
;
and
I
'll
tell
you
presently
the
means
*NL*
and
tricks
and
falsehoods
by
which
I
have
been
brought
here
;
but
in
the
*NL*
meantime
,
beg
and
entreat
of
your
master
not
to
touch
,
maltreat
,
wound
,
*NL*
or
slay
the
Knight
of
the
Mirrors
whom
he
has
at
his
feet
;
because
,
*NL*
beyond
all
dispute
,
it
is
the
rash
and
ill-advised
bachelor
Samson
*NL*
Carrasco
,
our
fellow
townsman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
he
of
the
Mirrors
came
to
himself
,
and
Don
Quixote
*NL*
perceiving
it
,
held
the
naked
point
of
his
sword
over
his
face
,
and
said
*NL*
to
him
,
``
You
are
a
dead
man
,
knight
,
unless
you
confess
that
the
peerless
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
excels
your
Casildea
de
Vandalia
in
beauty
;
and
in
*NL*
addition
to
this
you
must
promise
,
if
you
should
survive
this
encounter
*NL*
and
fall
,
to
go
to
the
city
of
El
Toboso
and
present
yourself
before

*NL*
on
my
behalf
,
that

good
pleasure
;
and
*NL*
if
she
leaves
you
free
to
do
yours
,
you
are
in
like
manner
to
return
and
*NL*
seek
me
out
-LRB-
for
the
trail
of
my
mighty
deeds
will
serve
you
as
a
guide
*NL*
to
lead
you
to
where
I
may
be

,
and
tell
me
what
may
have
passed
between
*NL*
you

her-conditions

,
in

with
what
we
stipulated
*NL*
before
our
combat
,
do
not
transgress
the
just
limits
of
knight-errantry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
''
said
the
fallen
knight
,
``
that
the
dirty
tattered
shoe
of
the
*NL*
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
is
better
than
the
ill-combed
though
clean
beard
*NL*
of
Casildea
;
and
I
promise
to
go
and
to
return
from
her
presence
to
*NL*
yours
,
and
to
give
you
a
full
and
particular
account
of
all
you
demand
of
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
also
confess
and
believe
,
''
added
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
the
knight
*NL*
you
vanquished
was
not
and
could
not
be
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
but
*NL*
some
one
else
in
his
likeness
,
just
as
I
confess
and
believe
that
you
,
*NL*
though
you
seem
to
be
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
,
are
not
so
,
but
some
*NL*
other
resembling
him

my
enemies
have
here
put
before
me
in
his
*NL*
shape
,
in
order
that
I
may
restrain
and
moderate
the
vehemence
of
my
*NL*
wrath
,
and
make
a
gentle
use
of
the
glory
of
my
victory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
hold
,
and
think
everything
to
be
as
you
believe

hold

the
crippled
knight
;
``
let
me
rise
,
I
entreat
you
;
if
,
indeed
,
*NL*
the
shock
of
my
fall
will
allow
me
,
for
it
has
left
me
in
a
sorry
plight
*NL*
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
helped
him
to
rise
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
squire
Tom
*NL*
Cecial
;
from
whom
Sancho
never
took
his
eyes
,
and
to
whom
he
put
*NL*
questions
,
the
replies
to
which
furnished
clear
proof
that
he
was
really
*NL*
and
truly
the
Tom
Cecial
he
said
;
but
the
impression
made
on
Sancho
's
*NL*
mind
by
what
his
master
said
about
the
enchanters
having
changed
the
face
*NL*
of
the
Knight
of
the
Mirrors
into
that
of
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
,
*NL*
would
not
permit
him
to
believe
what
he
saw
with
his
eyes
.
In
fine
,
both
*NL*
master
and
man
remained
under
the
delusion
;
and
,
down
in
the
mouth
,
and
*NL*
out
of
luck
,
he
of
the
Mirrors
and
his
squire
parted
from
Don
Quixote
and
*NL*
Sancho
,
he
meaning
to
go
look
for
some
village
where
he
could
plaster
and
*NL*
strap
his
ribs
.
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
resumed
their
journey
to
*NL*
Saragossa
,
and
on
it
the
history
leaves
them
in
order
that
it
may
tell
*NL*
who
the
Knight

long-nosed

CHAPTER
XV
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IT
IS
TOLD
AND
KNOWN
WHO
THE
KNIGHT
OF
THE
MIRRORS
AND
HIS
SQUIRE
*NL*
WERE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
went
off
satisfied
,
elated
,
and
vain-glorious
in
the
highest
*NL*
degree
at
having
won
a
victory
over
such
a
valiant
knight
as
he
fancied
*NL*
him
of
the
Mirrors
to
be
,
and
one
from
whose
knightly
word
he
expected
to
*NL*
learn
whether
the
enchantment
of
his
lady
still
continued
;
inasmuch
as
*NL*
the
said
vanquished
knight
was
bound
,
under
the
penalty
of
ceasing
to
be
*NL*
one
,
to
return
and
render
him
an
account
of
what
took
place
between
him
*NL*
and
her
.
But
Don
Quixote
was
of
one
mind
,
he
of
the
Mirrors
of
another
,
*NL*
for
he
just
then
had
no
thought
of
anything
but
finding
some
village
*NL*
where
he
could
plaster
himself
,
as
has
been
said
already
.
The
history
*NL*
goes
on
to
say
,
then
,
that
when
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
recommended
*NL*
Don
Quixote
to
resume
his
knight-errantry
which
he
had
laid
aside
,
it
was
*NL*
in
consequence
of
having
been
previously
in
conclave
with
the
curate
and
*NL*
the
barber
on
the
means
to
be
adopted
to
induce
Don
Quixote
to
stay
at
*NL*
home
in
peace
and
quiet
without
worrying
himself
with
his
ill-starred
*NL*
adventures
;
at
which
consultation
it
was
decided
by
the
unanimous
vote
of
*NL*
all
,
and
on
the
special
advice
of
Carrasco
,
that
Don
Quixote
should
be
*NL*
allowed
to
go
,
as
it
seemed
impossible
to
restrain
him
,
and
that
Samson
*NL*
should
sally
forth
to
meet
him
as
a
knight-errant
,
and
do
battle
with
*NL*
him
,
for
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
a
cause
,
and
vanquish
him
,
*NL*
that
being
looked
upon
as
an
easy
matter
;
and
that
it
should
be
agreed
*NL*
and
settled
that
the
vanquished
was
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
victor
.
*NL*
Then
,
Don
Quixote
being
vanquished
,
the
bachelor
knight
was
to
command
*NL*
him
to
return
to
his
village
and
his
house
,
and
not
quit
it
for
two
*NL*
years
,
or
until
he
received
further
orders
from
him
;
all
which
it
was
*NL*
clear
Don
Quixote
would
unhesitatingly
obey
,
rather
than
contravene
or
*NL*
fail
to
observe
the
laws
of
chivalry
;
and
during
the
period
of
his
*NL*
seclusion
he
might
perhaps
forget
his
folly
,
or
there
might
be
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
discovering
some
ready
remedy
for
his
madness
.
Carrasco
*NL*
undertook
the
task
,
and
Tom
Cecial
,
a
gossip
and
neighbour
of
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
's
,
a
lively
,
feather-headed
fellow
,
offered
himself
as
his
squire
.
*NL*
Carrasco
armed
himself
in
the
fashion
described
,
and
Tom
Cecial
,
that
he
*NL*
might
not
be
known
by
his
gossip
when
they
met
,
fitted
on
over
his
own
*NL*
natural
nose
the
false
masquerade
one
that
has
been
mentioned
;
and
so
*NL*
they
followed
the
same
route
Don
Quixote
took
,
and
almost
came
up
with
*NL*
him
in
time
to
be
present
at
the
adventure
of
the
cart
of
Death
and
*NL*
finally
encountered
them
in
the
grove
,
where
all
that
the
sagacious
*NL*
reader
has
been
reading
about
took
place
;
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
*NL*
extraordinary
fancies
of
Don
Quixote
,
and
his
conviction
that
the
*NL*
bachelor
was
not
the
bachelor
,
senor
bachelor
would
have
been
*NL*
incapacitated
for
ever
from
taking
his
degree
of
licentiate
,
all
through
*NL*
not
finding
nests
where
he
thought
to
find
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Cecial
,
seeing
how
ill
they
had
succeeded
,
and
what
a
sorry
end
their
*NL*
expedition
had
come
to
,
said
to
the
bachelor
,
``
Sure
enough
,
Senor
Samson
*NL*
Carrasco
,
we
are
served
right
;
it
is
easy
enough
to
plan
and
set
about
an
*NL*
enterprise
,
but
it
is
often
a
difficult
matter
to
come
well
out
of
it
.
*NL*
Don
Quixote
a
madman
,
and
we
sane
;
he
goes
off
laughing
,
safe
,
and
sound
,
*NL*
and
you
are
left
sore
and
sorry
!
I
'd
like
to
know
now
which
is
the
*NL*
madder
,
he
who
is
so
because
he
can
not
help
it
,
or
he
who
is
so
of
his
*NL*
own
choice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Samson
replied
,
``
The
difference
between
the
two
sorts
of
madmen
*NL*
is
,
that
he
who
is
so
will
he
nil
he
,
will
be
one
always
,
while
he
who
is
*NL*
so
of
his
own
accord
can
leave
off
being
one
whenever
he
likes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
Tom
Cecial
,
``
I
was
a
madman
of
my
own
accord
when
I
*NL*
volunteered
to
become
your
squire
,
and
,
of
my
own
accord
,
I
'll
leave
off
*NL*
being
one
and
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
your
affair
,
''
returned
Samson
,
``
but
to
suppose
that
I
am
going
*NL*
home
until
I
have
given
Don
Quixote
a
thrashing
is
absurd
;
and
it
is
not
*NL*
any
wish
that
he
may
recover
his
senses
that
will
make
me
hunt
him
out
*NL*
now
,
but
a
wish
for
the
sore
pain
I
am
in
with
my
ribs
wo
n't
let
me
*NL*
entertain
more
charitable
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
discoursing
,
the
pair
proceeded
until
they
reached
a
town
where
it
*NL*
was
their
good
luck
to
find
a
bone-setter
,
with
whose
help
the
*NL*
unfortunate
Samson
was
cured
.
Tom
Cecial
left
him
and
went
home
,
while
he
*NL*
stayed
behind
meditating
vengeance
;
and
the
history
will
return
to
him
*NL*
again
at
the
proper
time
,
so
as
not
to
omit
making
merry
with
Don
Quixote
*NL*
now

CHAPTER
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
BEFELL
DON
QUIXOTE
WITH
A
DISCREET
GENTLEMAN
OF
LA
MANCHA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
pursued
his
journey
in
the
high
spirits
,
satisfaction
,
and
*NL*
self-complacency
already
described
,
fancying
himself
the
most
valorous
*NL*
knight-errant
of
the
age
in
the
world
because
of
his
late
victory
.
All
*NL*
the
adventures
that
could
befall
him
from
that
time
forth
he
regarded
as
*NL*
already
done
and
brought
to
a
happy
issue
;
he
made
light
of
enchantments
*NL*
and
enchanters
;
he
thought
no
more
of
the
countless
drubbings
that
had
*NL*
been
administered
to
him
in
the
course
of
his
knight-errantry
,
nor
of
the
*NL*
volley
of
stones
that
had
levelled
half
his
teeth
,
nor
of
the
ingratitude
*NL*
of
the
galley
slaves
,
nor
of
the
audacity
of
the
Yanguesans
and
the
*NL*
shower
of
stakes
that
fell
upon
him
;
in
short
,
he
said
to
himself
that
*NL*
could
he
discover
any
means
,
mode
,
or
way
of
disenchanting
his
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
,
he
would
not
envy
the
highest
fortune
that
the
most
fortunate
*NL*
knight-errant
of
yore
ever
reached
or
could
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
going
along
entirely
absorbed
in
these
fancies
,
when
Sancho
said
*NL*
to
him
,
``
Is
n't
it
odd
,
senor
,
that
I
have
still
before
my
eyes
that
*NL*
monstrous
enormous
nose
of
my
gossip
,
Tom
Cecial
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
dost
thou
,
then
,
believe
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
the
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Mirrors
was
the
bachelor
Carrasco
,
and
his
squire
Tom
*NL*
Cecial
thy
gossip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
that
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
all
I
know
is
that
*NL*
the
tokens
he
gave
me
about
my
own
house
,
wife
and
children
,
nobody
else
*NL*
but
himself
could
have
given
me
;
and
the
face
,
once
the
nose
was
off
,
was
*NL*
the
very
face
of
Tom
Cecial
,
as
I
have
seen
it
many
a
time
in
my
town
and
*NL*
next
door
to
my
own
house
;
and
the
sound
of
the
voice
was
just
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
reason
the
matter
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
``
Come
now
,
by
what
*NL*
process
of
thinking
can
it
be
supposed
that
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
*NL*
would
come
as
a
knight-errant
,
in
arms
offensive
and
defensive
,
to
fight
*NL*
with
me
?
Have
I
ever
been
by
any
chance
his
enemy
?
Have
I
ever
given
him
*NL*
any
occasion
to
owe
me
a
grudge
?
Am
I
his
rival
,
or
does
he
profess
arms
,
*NL*
that
he
should
envy
the
fame
I
have
acquired
in
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
what
are
we
to
say
,
senor
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
about
that
*NL*
knight
,
whoever
he
is
,
being
so
like
the
bachelor
Carrasco
,
and
his
*NL*
squire
so
like
my
gossip
,
Tom
Cecial
?
And
if
that
be
enchantment
,
as
your
*NL*
worship
says
,
was
there
no
other
pair
in
the
world
for
them
to
take
the
*NL*
likeness
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
a
scheme
and
plot
of
the
malignant
*NL*
magicians
that
persecute
me
,
who
,
foreseeing
that
I
was
to
be
victorious
*NL*
in
the
conflict
,
arranged
that
the
vanquished
knight
should
display
the
*NL*
countenance
of
my
friend
the
bachelor
,
in
order
that
the
friendship
I
*NL*
bear
him
should
interpose
to
stay
the
edge
of
my
sword
and
might
of
my
*NL*
arm
,
and
temper
the
just
wrath
of
my
heart
;
so
that
he
who
sought
to
take
*NL*
my
life
by
fraud
and
falsehood
should
save
his
own
.
And
to
prove
it
,
thou
*NL*
knowest
already
,
Sancho
,
by
experience
which
can
not
lie
or
deceive
,
how
*NL*
easy
it
is
for
enchanters
to
change
one
countenance
into
another
,
turning
*NL*
fair
into
foul
,
and
foul
into
fair
;
for
it
is
not
two
days
since
thou
*NL*
sawest
with
thine
own
eyes
the
beauty
and
elegance
of
the
peerless
*NL*
Dulcinea
in
all
its
perfection
and
natural
harmony
,
while
I
saw
her
in
*NL*
the
repulsive
and
mean
form
of
a
coarse
country
wench
,
with
cataracts
in
*NL*
her
eyes
and
a
foul
smell
in
her
mouth
;
and
when
the
perverse
enchanter
*NL*
ventured
to
effect
so
wicked
a
transformation
,
it
is
no
wonder
if
he
*NL*
effected
that
of
Samson
Carrasco
and
thy
gossip
in
order
to
snatch
the
*NL*
glory
of
victory
out
of
my
grasp
.
For
all
that
,
however
,
I
console
*NL*
myself
,
because
,
after
all
,
in
whatever
shape
he
may
have
been
,
I
have
*NL*
victorious
over
my
enemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
what
's
the
truth
of
it
all
,
''
said
Sancho
;
and
knowing
as
he
*NL*
did
that
the
transformation
of
Dulcinea
had
been
a
device
and
imposition
*NL*
of
his
own
,
his
master
's
illusions
were
not
satisfactory
to
him
;
but
he
*NL*
did
not
like
to
reply
lest
he
should
say
something
that
might
disclose
*NL*
his
trickery
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
were
engaged
in
this
conversation
they
were
overtaken
by
a
man
*NL*
who
was
following
the
same
road
behind
them
,
mounted
on
a
very
handsome
*NL*
flea-bitten
mare
,
and
dressed
in
a
gaban
of
fine
green
cloth
,
with
tawny
*NL*
velvet
facings
,
and
a
montera
of
the
same
velvet
.
The
trappings
of
the
*NL*
mare
were
of
the
field
and
jineta
fashion
,
and
of
mulberry
colour
and
*NL*
green
.
He
carried
a
Moorish
cutlass
hanging
from
a
broad
green
and
gold
*NL*
baldric
;
the
buskins
were
of
the
same
make
as
the
baldric
;
the
spurs
were
*NL*
not
gilt
,
but
lacquered
green
,
and
so
brightly
polished
that
,
matching
as
*NL*
they
did
the
rest
of
his
apparel
,
they
looked
better
than
if
they
had
*NL*
been
of
pure
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
traveller
came
up
with
them
he
saluted
them
courteously
,
and
*NL*
spurring
his
mare
was
passing
them
without
stopping
,
but
Don
Quixote
*NL*
called
out
to
him
,
``
Gallant
sir
,
if
so
be
your
worship
is
going
our
road
,
*NL*
and
has
no
occasion
for
speed
,
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
me
if
we
were
to
*NL*
join
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
,
''
replied
he
on
the
mare
,
``
I
would
not
pass
you
so
hastily
but
*NL*
for
fear
that
horse
might
turn
restive
in
the
company
of
my
mare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
safely
hold
in
your
mare
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
in
reply
to
this
,
*NL*
``
for
our
horse
is
the
most
virtuous
and
well-behaved
horse
in
the
world
;
*NL*
he
never
does
anything
wrong
on
such
occasions
,
and
the
only
time
he
*NL*
misbehaved
,
my
master
and
I
suffered
for
it
sevenfold
;
I
say
again
your
*NL*
worship
may
pull
up
if
you
like
;
for
if
she
was
offered
to
him
between
*NL*
two
plates
the
horse
would
not
hanker
after
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
drew
rein
,
amazed
at
the
trim
and
features
of
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
who
rode
without
his
helmet
,
which
Sancho
carried
like
a
valise
in
front
*NL*
of
Dapple
's
pack-saddle
;
and
if
the
man
in
green
examined
Don
Quixote
*NL*
closely
,
still
more
closely
did
Don
Quixote
examine
the
man
in
green
,
who
*NL*
struck
him
as
being
a
man
of
intelligence
.
In
appearance
he
was
about
*NL*
fifty
years
of
age
,
with
but
few
grey
hairs
,
an
aquiline
cast
of
*NL*
features
,
and
an
expression
between
grave
and
gay
;
and
his
dress
and
*NL*
accoutrements
showed
him
to
be
a
man
of
good
condition
.
What
he
in
green
*NL*
thought
of
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
was
that
a
man
of
that
sort
and
shape
*NL*
he
had
never
yet
seen
;
he
marvelled
at
the
length
of
his
hair
,
his
lofty
*NL*
stature
,
the
lankness
and
sallowness
of
his
countenance
,
his
armour
,
his
*NL*
bearing
and
his
gravity
--
a
figure
and
picture
such
as
had
not
been
seen
*NL*
in
those
regions
for
many
a
long
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
saw
very
plainly
the
attention
with
which
the
traveller
was
*NL*
regarding
him
,
and
read
his
curiosity
in
his
astonishment
;
and
courteous
*NL*
as
he
was
and
ready
to
please
everybody
,
before
the
other
could
ask
him
*NL*
any
question
he
anticipated
him
by
saying
,
``
The
appearance
I
present
to
*NL*
your
worship
being
so
strange
and
so
out
of
the
common
,
I
should
not
be
*NL*
surprised
if
it
filled
you
with
wonder
;
but
you
will
cease
to
wonder
when
*NL*
I
tell
you
,
as
I
do
,
that
I
am
one
of
those
knights
who
,
as
people
say
,
*NL*
go
seeking
adventures
.
I
have
left
my
home
,
I
have
mortgaged
my
estate
,
I
*NL*
have
given
up
my
comforts
,
and
committed
myself
to
the
arms
of
Fortune
,
*NL*
to
bear
me
whithersoever
she
may
please
.
My
desire
was
to
bring
to
life
*NL*
again
knight-errantry
,
now
dead
,
and
for
some
time
past
,
stumbling
here
,
*NL*
falling
there
,
now
coming
down
headlong
,
now
raising
myself
up
again
,
I
*NL*
have
carried
out
a
great
portion
of
my
design
,
succouring
widows
,
*NL*
protecting
maidens
,
and
giving
aid
to
wives
,
orphans
,
and
minors
,
the
*NL*
proper
and
natural
duty
of
knights-errant
;
and
,
therefore
,
because
of
my
*NL*
many
valiant
and
Christian
achievements
,
I
have
been
already
found
worthy
*NL*
to
make
my
way
in
print
to
well-nigh
all
,
or
most
,
of
the
nations
of
the
*NL*
earth
.
Thirty
thousand
volumes
of
my
history
have
been
printed
,
and
it
is
*NL*
on
the
high-road
to
be
printed
thirty
thousand
thousands
of
times
,
if
*NL*
heaven
does
not
put
a
stop
to
it
.
In
short
,
to
sum
up
all
in
a
few
words
,
*NL*
or
in
a
single
one
,
I
may
tell
you
I
am
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
*NL*
otherwise
called
`
The
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
;
'
for
though
*NL*
self-praise
is
degrading
,
I
must
perforce
sound
my
own
sometimes
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
when
there
is
no
one
at
hand
to
do
it
for
me
.
So
that
,
gentle
*NL*
sir
,
neither
this
horse
,
nor
this
lance
,
nor
this
shield
,
nor
this
*NL*
squire
,
nor
all
these
arms
put
together
,
nor
the
sallowness
of
my
*NL*
countenance
,
nor
my
gaunt
leanness
,
will
henceforth
astonish
you
,
now
*NL*
that
you
know
who
I
am
and
what
profession
I
follow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
Don
Quixote
held
his
peace
,
and
,
from
the
time
he
took
*NL*
to
answer
,
the
man
in
green
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
for
a
reply
;
after
a
*NL*
long
pause
,
however
,
he
said
to
him
,
``
You
were
right
when
you
saw
*NL*
curiosity
in
my
amazement
,
sir
knight
;
but
you
have
not
succeeded
in
*NL*
removing
the
astonishment
I
feel
at
seeing
you
;
for
although
you
say
,
*NL*
senor
,
that
knowing
who
you
are
ought
to
remove
it
,
it
has
not
done
so
;
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
now
that
I
know
,
I
am
left
more
amazed
and
astonished
*NL*
than
before
.
What
!
is
it
possible
that
there
are
knights-errant
in
the
*NL*
world
in
these
days
,
and
histories
of
real
chivalry
printed
?
I
can
not
*NL*
realise
the
fact
that
there
can
be
anyone
on
earth
now-a-days
who
aids
*NL*
widows
,
or
protects
maidens
,
or
defends
wives
,
or
succours
orphans
;
nor
*NL*
should
I
believe
it
had
I
not
seen
it
in
your
worship
with
my
own
eyes
.
*NL*
Blessed
be
heaven
!
for
by
means
of
this
history
of
your
noble
and
genuine
*NL*
chivalrous
deeds
,
which
you
say
has
been
printed
,
the
countless
stories
*NL*
of
fictitious
knights-errant
with
which
the
world
is
filled
,
so
much
to
*NL*
the
injury
of
morality
and
the
prejudice
and
discredit
of
good
histories
,
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
that
point
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
as
to
*NL*
whether
the
histories
of
the
knights-errant
are
fiction
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
is
there
anyone
who
doubts
that
those
histories
are
false

said
*NL*
the
man
in
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
never
mind
that
just
now
;
if
our
*NL*
journey
lasts
long
enough
,
I
trust
in
God
I
shall
show
your
worship
that
*NL*
you
do
wrong
in
going
with
the

regard
it
as

*NL*
of

From
this
last
observation
of
Don
Quixote
's
,
the
traveller
began
to
have
*NL*
a
suspicion
that
he
was
some
crazy
being
,
and
was
waiting
for
him
to
confirm
*NL*
it
by
something
further
;
but
before
they
could
turn
to
any
new
subject
*NL*
Don
Quixote
begged
him
to
tell
him
who
he
was
,
since
he
himself
had
*NL*
rendered
account
of
his
station
and
life
.
To
this
,
he
in
the
green
gaban
*NL*
replied
``
I
,
Sir
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
am
a
gentleman
by
*NL*
birth
,
native
of
the
village
where
,
please
God
,
we
are
going
to
dine
*NL*
today
;
I
am
more
than
fairly
well
off
,
and
my
name
is
Don
Diego
de
*NL*
Miranda
.
I
pass
my
life
with
my
wife
,
children
,
and
friends
;
my
pursuits
*NL*
are
hunting
and
fishing
,
but
I
keep
neither
hawks
nor
greyhounds
,
nothing
*NL*
but
a
tame
partridge
or
a
bold
ferret
or
two
;
I
have
six
dozen
or
so
of
*NL*
books
,
some
in
our
mother
tongue
,
some
Latin
,
some
of
them
history
,
*NL*
others
devotional
;
those
of
chivalry
have
not
as
yet
crossed
the
*NL*
threshold
of
my
door
;
I
am
more
given
to
turning
over
the
profane
than
*NL*
the
devotional
,
so
long
as
they
are
books
of
honest
entertainment
that
*NL*
charm
by
their
style
and
attract
and
interest
by
the
invention
they
*NL*
display
,
though
of
these
there
are
very
few
in
Spain
.
Sometimes
I
dine
*NL*
with
my
neighbours
and
friends
,
and
often
invite
them
;
my
entertainments
*NL*
are
neat
and
well
served
without
stint
of
anything
.
I
have
no
taste
for
*NL*
tattle
,
nor
do
I
allow
tattling
in
my
presence
;
I
pry
not
into
my
*NL*
neighbours
'
lives
,
nor
have
I
lynx-eyes
for
what
others
do
.
I
hear
mass
*NL*
every
day
;
I
share
my
substance
with
the
poor
,
making
no
display
of
good
*NL*
works
,
lest
I
let
hypocrisy
and
vainglory
,
those
enemies
that
subtly
take
*NL*
possession
of
the
most
watchful
heart
,
find
an
entrance
into
mine
.
I
*NL*
strive
to
make
peace
between
those
whom
I
know
to
be
at
variance
;
I
am
*NL*
the
devoted
servant
of
Our
Lady
,
and
my
trust
is
ever
in
the
infinite
*NL*
mercy
of
God
our
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
to
the
account
of
the
*NL*
gentleman
's
life
and
occupation
;
and
thinking
it
a
good
and
a
holy
life
,
*NL*
and
that
he
who
led
it
ought
to
work
miracles
,
he
threw
himself
off
*NL*
Dapple
,
and
running
in
haste
seized
his
right
stirrup
and
kissed
his
foot
*NL*
again
and
again
with
a
devout
heart
and
almost
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
this
the
gentleman
asked
him
,
``
What
are
you
about
,
brother
?
What
*NL*
are
these
kisses
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
kiss
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
I
think
your
worship
is
the
first
saint
*NL*
in
the
saddle
I
ever
saw
all
the
days
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
no
saint
,
''
replied
the
gentleman
,
``
but
a
great
sinner
;
but
you
are
,
*NL*
brother
,
for
you
must
be
a
good
fellow
,
as
your
simplicity
shows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
went
back
and
regained
his
pack-saddle
,
having
extracted
a
laugh
*NL*
from
his
master
's
profound
melancholy
,
and
excited
fresh
amazement
in
Don
*NL*
Diego
.
Don
Quixote
then
asked
him
how
many
children
he
had
,
and
observed
*NL*
that
one
of
the
things
wherein
the
ancient
philosophers
,
who
were
without
*NL*
the
true
knowledge
of
God
,
placed
the
summum
bonum
was
in
the
gifts
of
*NL*
nature
,
in
those
of
fortune
,
in
having
many
friends
,
and
many
and
good
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
''
answered
the
gentleman
,
``
have
one
son
,
without
*NL*
whom
,
perhaps
,
I
should
count
myself
happier
than
I
am
,
not
because
he
is
*NL*
a
bad
son
,
but
because
he
is
not
so
good
as
I
could
wish
.
He
is
eighteen
*NL*
years
of
age
;
he
has
been
for
six
at
Salamanca
studying
Latin
and
Greek
,
*NL*
and
when
I
wished
him
to
turn
to
the
study
of
other
sciences
I
found
him
*NL*
so
wrapped
up
in
that
of
poetry
-LRB-
if
that
can
be
called
a
science
-RRB-
that
*NL*
there
is
no
getting
him
to
take
kindly
to
the
law
,
which
I
wished
him
to
*NL*
study
,
or
to
theology
,
the
queen
of
them
all
.
I
would
like
him
to
be
an
*NL*
honour
to
his
family
,
as
we
live
in
days
when
our
kings
liberally
reward
*NL*
learning
that
is
virtuous
and
worthy
;
for
learning
without
virtue
is
a
*NL*
pearl
on
a
dunghill
.
He
spends
the
whole
day
in
settling
whether
Homer
*NL*
expressed
himself
correctly
or
not
in
such
and
such
a
line
of
the
Iliad
,
*NL*
whether
Martial
was
indecent
or
not
in
such
and
such
an
epigram
,
whether
*NL*
such
and
such
lines
of
Virgil
are
to
be
understood
in
this
way
or
in
*NL*
that
;
in
short
,
all
his
talk
is
of
the
works
of
these
poets
,
and
those
of
*NL*
Horace
,
Perseus
,
Juvenal
,
and
Tibullus
;
for
of
the
moderns
in
our
own
*NL*
language
he
makes
no
great
account
;
but
with
all
his
seeming
indifference
*NL*
to
Spanish
poetry
,
just
now
his
thoughts
are
absorbed
in
making
a
gloss
*NL*
on
four
lines
that
have
been
sent
him
from
Salamanca
,
which
I
suspect
are
*NL*
for
some
poetical
tournament
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
Don
Quixote
said
in
reply
,
``
Children
,
senor
,
are
portions
of
*NL*
their
parents
'
bowels
,
and
therefore
,
be
they
good
or
bad
,
are
to
be
*NL*
loved
as
we
love
the
souls
that
give
us
life
;
it
is
for
the
parents
to
*NL*
guide
them
from
infancy
in
the
ways
of
virtue
,
propriety
,
and
worthy
*NL*
Christian
conduct
,
so
that
when
grown
up
they
may
be
the
staff
of
their
*NL*
parents
'
old
age
,
and
the
glory
of
their
posterity
;
and
to
force
them
to
*NL*
study
this
or
that
science
I
do
not
think
wise
,
though
it
may
be
no
harm
*NL*
to
persuade
them
;
and
when
there
is
no
need
to
study
for
the
sake
of
pane
*NL*
lucrando
,
and
it
is
the
student
's
good
fortune
that
heaven
has
given
him
*NL*
parents
who
provide
him
with
it
,
it
would
be
my
advice
to
them
to
let
him
*NL*
pursue
whatever
science
they
may
see
him
most
inclined
to
;
and
though
*NL*
that
of
poetry
is
less
useful
than
pleasurable
,
it
is
not
one
of
those
*NL*
that
bring
discredit
upon
the
possessor
.
Poetry
,
gentle
sir
,
is
,
as
I
*NL*
take
it
,
like
a
tender
young
maiden
of
supreme
beauty
,
to
array
,
bedeck
,
*NL*
and
adorn
whom
is
the
task
of
several
other
maidens
,
who
are
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
sciences
;
and
she
must
avail
herself
of
the
help
of
all
,
and
all
*NL*
derive
their
lustre
from
her
.
But
this
maiden
will
not
bear
to
be
*NL*
handled
,
nor
dragged
through
the
streets
,
nor
exposed
either
at
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
market-places
,
or
in
the
closets
of
palaces
.
She
is
the
*NL*
product
of
an
Alchemy
of
such
virtue
that
he
who
is
able
to
practise
it
,
*NL*
will
turn
her
into
pure
gold
of
inestimable
worth
.
He
that
possesses
her
*NL*
must
keep
her
within
bounds
,
not
permitting
her
to
break
out
in
ribald
*NL*
satires
or
soulless
sonnets
.
She
must
on
no
account
be
offered
for
sale
,
*NL*
unless
,
indeed
,
it
be
in
heroic
poems
,
moving
tragedies
,
or
sprightly
and
*NL*
ingenious
comedies
.
She
must
not
be
touched
by
the
buffoons
,
nor
by
the
*NL*
ignorant
vulgar
,
incapable
of
comprehending
or
appreciating
her
hidden
*NL*
treasures
.
And
do
not
suppose
,
senor
,
that
I
apply
the
term
vulgar
here
*NL*
merely
to
plebeians
and
the
lower
orders
;
for
everyone
who
is
ignorant
,
*NL*
be
he
lord
or
prince
,
may
and
should
be
included
among
the
vulgar
.
He
,
*NL*
then
,
who
shall
embrace
and
cultivate
poetry
under
the
conditions
I
have
*NL*
named
,
shall
become
famous
,
and
his
name
honoured
throughout
all
the
*NL*
civilised
nations
of
the
earth
.
And
with
regard
to
what
you
say
,
senor
,
*NL*
of
your
son
having
no
great
opinion
of
Spanish
poetry
,
I
am
inclined
to
*NL*
think
that
he
is
not
quite
right
there
,
and
for
this
reason
:
the
great
*NL*
poet
Homer
did
not
write
in
Latin
,
because
he
was
a
Greek
,
nor
did
Virgil
*NL*
write
in
Greek
,
because
he
was
a
Latin
;
in
short
,
all
the
ancient
poets
*NL*
wrote
in
the
language
they
imbibed
with
their
mother
's
milk
,
and
never
*NL*
went
in
quest
of
foreign
ones
to
express
their
sublime
conceptions
;
and
*NL*
that
being
so
,
the
usage
should
in
justice
extend
to
all
nations
,
and
the
*NL*
German
poet
should
not
be
undervalued
because
he
writes
in
his
own
*NL*
language
,
nor
the
Castilian
,
nor
even
the
Biscayan
,
for
writing
in
his
.
*NL*
But
your
son
,
senor
,
I
suspect
,
is
not
prejudiced
against
Spanish
poetry
,
*NL*
but
against
those
poets
who
are
mere
Spanish
verse
writers
,
without
any
*NL*
knowledge
of
other
languages
or
sciences
to
adorn
and
give
life
and
*NL*
vigour
to
their
natural
inspiration
;
and
yet
even
in
this
he
may
be
*NL*
wrong
;
for
,
according
to
a
true
belief
,
a
poet
is
born
one
;
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
the
poet
by
nature
comes
forth
a
poet
from
his
mother
's
womb
;
and
*NL*
following
the
bent
that
heaven
has
bestowed
upon
him
,
without
the
aid
of
*NL*
study
or
art
,
he
produces
things
that
show
how
truly
he
spoke
who
said
,
*NL*
`
Est
Deus
in
nobis
,
'
etc.
.
At
the
same
time
,
I
say
that
the
poet
by
nature
*NL*
who
calls
in
art
to
his
aid
will
be
a
far
better
poet
,
and
will
surpass
*NL*
him
who
tries
to
be
one
relying
upon
his
knowledge
of
art
alone
.
The
*NL*
reason
is
,
that
art
does
not
surpass
nature
,
but
only
brings
it
to
*NL*
perfection
;
and
thus
,
nature
combined
with
art
,
and
art
with
nature
,
will
*NL*
produce
a
perfect
poet
.
To
bring
my
argument
to
a
close
,
I
would
say
*NL*
then
,
gentle
sir
,
let
your
son
go
on
as
his
star
leads
him
,
for
being
so
*NL*
studious
as
he
seems
to
be
,
and
having
already
successfully
surmounted
*NL*
the
first
step
of
the
sciences
,
which
is
that
of
the
languages
,
with
*NL*
their
help
he
will
by
his
own
exertions
reach
the
summit
of
polite
*NL*
literature
,
which
so
well
becomes
an
independent
gentleman
,
and
adorns
,
*NL*
honours
,
and
distinguishes
him
,
as
much
as
the
mitre
does
the
bishop
,
or
*NL*
the
gown
the
learned
counsellor
.
If
your
son
write
satires
reflecting
on
*NL*
the
honour
of
others
,
chide
and
correct
him
,
and
tear
them
up
;
but
if
he
*NL*
compose
discourses
in
which
he
rebukes
vice
in
general
,
in
the
style
of
*NL*
Horace
,
and
with
elegance
like
his
,
commend
him
;
for
it
is
legitimate
for
*NL*
a
poet
to
write
against
envy
and
lash
the
envious
in
his
verse
,
and
the
*NL*
other
vices
too
,
provided
he
does
not
single
out
individuals
;
there
are
,
*NL*
however
,
poets
who
,
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
spiteful
,
would
run
*NL*
the
risk
of
being
banished
to
the
coast
of
Pontus
.
If
the
poet
be
pure
in
*NL*
his
morals
,
he
will
be
pure
in
his
verses
too
;
the
pen
is
the
tongue
of
*NL*
the
mind
,
and
as
the
thought
engendered
there
,
so
will
be
the
things
that
*NL*
it
writes
down
.
And
when
kings
and
princes
observe
this
marvellous
*NL*
science
of
poetry
in
wise
,
virtuous
,
and
thoughtful
subjects
,
they
*NL*
honour
,
value
,
exalt
them
,
and
even
crown
them
with
the
leaves
of
that
*NL*
tree
which
the
thunderbolt
strikes
not
,
as
if
to
show
that
they
whose
*NL*
brows
are
honoured
and
adorned
with
such
a
crown
are
not
to
be
assailed
*NL*
by
anyone
.

*NL*
He
of
the
green
gaban
was
filled
with
astonishment
at
Don
Quixote
's
*NL*
argument
,
so
much
so
that
he
began
to
abandon
the
notion
he
had
taken
up
*NL*
about
his
being
crazy
.
But
in
the
middle
of
the
discourse
,
it
being
not
*NL*
very
much
to
his
taste
,
Sancho
had
turned
aside
out
of
the
road
to
beg
a
*NL*
little
milk
from
some
shepherds
,
who
were
milking
their
ewes
hard
by
;
and
*NL*
just
as
the
gentleman
,
highly
pleased
,
was
about
to
renew
the
*NL*
conversation
,
Don
Quixote
,
raising
his
head
,
perceived
a
cart
covered
*NL*
with
royal
flags
coming
along
the
road
they
were
travelling
;
and
*NL*
persuaded
that
this
must
be
some
new
adventure
,
he
called
aloud
to
Sancho
*NL*
to
come
and
bring
him
his
helmet
.
Sancho
,
hearing
himself
called
,
quitted
*NL*
the
shepherds
,
and
,
prodding
Dapple
vigorously
,
came
up
to
his

there
fell
a
terrific
and
desperate
adventure

*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
SHOWN
THE
FURTHEST
AND
HIGHEST
POINT
WHICH
THE
UNEXAMPLED
*NL*
COURAGE
OF
DON
QUIXOTE
REACHED
OR
COULD
REACH
;
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
HAPPILY
*NL*
ACHIEVED
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
LIONS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
tells
that
when
Don
Quixote
called
out
to
Sancho
to
bring
him
*NL*
his
helmet
,
Sancho
was
buying
some
curds
the
shepherds
agreed
to
sell
*NL*
him
,
and
flurried
by
the
great
haste
his
master
was
in
did
not
know
what
*NL*
to
do
with
them
or
what
to
carry
them
in
;
so
,
not
to
lose
them
,
for
he
*NL*
had
already
paid
for
them
,
he
thought
it
best
to
throw
them
into
his
*NL*
master
's
helmet
,
and
acting
on
this
bright
idea
he
went
to
see
what
his
*NL*
master
wanted
with
him
.
He
,
as
he
approached
,
exclaimed
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
that
helmet
,
my
friend
,
for
either
I
know
little
of
adventures
,
*NL*
or
what
I
observe
yonder
is
one
that
will
,
and
does
,
call
upon
me
to
arm
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
of
the
green
gaban
,
on
hearing
this
,
looked
in
all
directions
,
but
*NL*
could
perceive
nothing
,
except
a
cart
coming
towards
them
with
two
or
*NL*
three
small
flags
,
which
led
him
to
conclude
it
must
be
carrying
treasure
*NL*
of
the
King
's
,
and
he
said
so
to
Don
Quixote
.
He
,
however
,
would
not
*NL*
believe
him
,
being
always
persuaded
and
convinced
that
all
that
happened
*NL*
to
him
must
be
adventures
and
still
more
adventures
;
so
he
replied
to
the
*NL*
gentleman
,
``
He
who
is
prepared
has
his
battle
half
fought
;
nothing
is
*NL*
lost
by
my
preparing
myself
,
for
I
know
by
experience
that
I
have
*NL*
enemies
,
visible
and
invisible
,
and
I
know
not
when
,
or
where
,
or
at
what
*NL*
moment
,
or
in
what
shapes
they
will
attack
me
;
''
and
turning
to
Sancho
he
*NL*
called
for
his
helmet
;
and
Sancho
,
as
he
had
no
time
to
take
out
the
*NL*
curds
,
had
to
give
it
just
as
it
was
.
Don
Quixote
took
it
,
and
without
*NL*
perceiving
what
was
in
it
thrust
it
down
in
hot
haste
upon
his
head
;
but
*NL*
as
the
curds
were
pressed
and
squeezed
the
whey
began
to
run
all
over
his
*NL*
face
and
beard
,
whereat
he
was
so
startled
that
he
cried
out
to
Sancho
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sancho
,
what
's
this
?
I
think
my
head
is
softening
,
or
my
brains
are
*NL*
melting
,
or
I
am
sweating
from
head
to
foot
!
If
I
am
sweating
it
is
not
*NL*
indeed
from
fear
.
I
am
convinced
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
adventure
which
*NL*
is
about
to
befall
me
is
a
terrible
one
.
Give
me
something
to
wipe
myself
*NL*
with
,
if
thou
hast
it
,
for
this
profuse
sweat
is
blinding
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
held
his
tongue
,
and
gave
him
a
cloth
,
and
gave
thanks
to
God
at
*NL*
the
same
time
that
his
master
had
not
found
out
what
was
the
matter
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
then
wiped
himself
,
and
took
off
his
helmet
to
see
what
it
was
*NL*
that
made
his
head
feel
so
cool
,
and
seeing
all
that
white
mash
inside
*NL*
his
helmet
he
put
it
to
his
nose
,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
smelt
it
he
*NL*
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
life
of
my
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
but
it
is
curds
thou
hast
*NL*
put
here
,
thou
treacherous
,
impudent
,
ill-mannered
squire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
,
with
great
composure
and
pretended
innocence
,
Sancho
replied
,
*NL*
``
If
they
are
curds
let
me
have
them
,
your
worship
,
and
I
'll
eat
them
;
but
*NL*
let
the
devil
eat
them
,
for
it
must
have
been
he
who
put
them
there
.
I
*NL*
dare
to
dirty
your
helmet
!
You
have
guessed
the
offender
finely
!
Faith
,
*NL*
sir
,
by
the
light
God
gives
me
,
it
seems
I
must
have
enchanters
too
,
that
*NL*
persecute
me
as
a
creature
and
limb
of
your
worship
,
and
they
must
have
*NL*
put
that
nastiness
there
in
order
to
provoke
your
patience
to
anger
,
and
*NL*
make
you
baste
my
ribs
as
you
are
wont
to
do
.
Well
,
this
time
,
indeed
,
*NL*
they
have
missed
their
aim
,
for
I
trust
to
my
master
's
good
sense
to
see
*NL*
that
I
have
got
no
curds
or
milk
,
or
anything
of
the
sort
;
and
that
if
I
*NL*
had
it
is
in
my
stomach
I
would
put
it
and
not
in
the
helmet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
be
so
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
All
this
the
gentleman
was
observing
,
and
*NL*
with
astonishment
,
more
especially
when
,
after
having
wiped
himself
*NL*
clean
,
his
head
,
face
,
beard
,
and
helmet
,
Don
Quixote
put
it
on
,
and
*NL*
settling
himself
firmly
in
his
stirrups
,
easing
his
sword
in
the
*NL*
scabbard
,
and
grasping
his
lance
,
he
cried
,
``
Now
,
come
who
will
,
here
am
*NL*
I
,
ready
to
try
conclusions
with
Satan
himself
in
person
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
cart
with
the
flags
had
come
up
,
unattended
by
anyone
*NL*
except
the
carter
on
a
mule
,
and
a
man
sitting
in
front
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
planted
himself
before
it
and
said
,
``
Whither
are
you
going
,
brothers
?
*NL*
What
cart
is
this
?
What
have
you
got
in
it
?
What
flags
are
those
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
carter
replied
,
``
The
cart
is
mine
;
what
is
in
it
is
a
pair
of
*NL*
wild
caged
lions
,
which
the
governor
of
Oran
is
sending
to
court
as
a
*NL*
present
to
his
Majesty
;
and
the
flags
are
our
lord
the
King
's
,
to
show
*NL*
that
what
is
here
is
his
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
the
lions
large
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
large
,
''
replied
the
man
who
sat
at
the
door
of
the
cart
,
``
that
*NL*
larger
,
or
as
large
,
have
never
crossed
from
Africa
to
Spain
;
I
am
the
*NL*
keeper
,
and
I
have
brought
over
others
,
but
never
any
like
these
.
They
*NL*
are
male
and
female
;
the
male
is
in
that
first
cage
and
the
female
in
the
*NL*
one
behind
,
and
they
are
hungry
now
,
for
they
have
eaten
nothing
to-day
,
*NL*
so
let
your
worship
stand
aside
,
for
we
must
make
haste
to
the
place
*NL*
where
we
are
to
feed
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
,
smiling
slightly
,
Don
Quixote
exclaimed
,
``
Lion-whelps
to
me
!
to
*NL*
me
whelps
of
lions
,
and
at
such
a
time
!
Then
,
by
God
!
those
gentlemen
who
*NL*
send
them
here
shall
see
if
I
am
a
man
to
be
frightened
by
lions
.
Get
*NL*
down
,
my
good
fellow
,
and
as
you
are
the
keeper
open
the
cages
,
and
turn
*NL*
me
out
those
beasts
,
and
in
the
midst
of
this
plain
I
will
let
them
know
*NL*
who
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
is
,
in
spite
and
in
the
teeth
of
the
*NL*
enchanters
who
send
them
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
so
,
''
said
the
gentleman
to
himself
at
this
;
``
our
worthy
knight
has
*NL*
shown
of
what
sort
he
is
;
the
curds
,
no
doubt
,
have
softened
his
skull
*NL*
and
brought
his
brains
to
a
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
Sancho
came
up
to
him
,
saying
,
``
Senor
,
for
God
's
sake
do
*NL*
something
to
keep
my
master
,
Don
Quixote
,
from
tackling
these
lions
;
for
*NL*
if
he
does
they
'll
tear
us
all
to
pieces
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
master
then
so
mad
,
''
asked
the
gentleman
,
``
that
you
believe
and
*NL*
are
afraid
he
will
engage
such
fierce
animals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
mad
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
he
is
venturesome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
prevent
it
,
''
said
the
gentleman
;
and
going
over
to
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
who
was
insisting
upon
the
keeper
's
opening
the
cages
,
he
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Sir
knight
,
knights-errant
should
attempt
adventures
which
encourage
the
*NL*
hope
of
a
successful
issue
,
not
those
which
entirely
withhold
it
;
for
*NL*
valour
that
trenches
upon
temerity
savours
rather
of
madness
than
of
*NL*
courage
;
moreover
,
these
lions
do
not
come
to
oppose
you
,
nor
do
they
*NL*
dream
of
such
a
thing
;
they
are
going
as
presents
to
his
Majesty
,
and
it
*NL*
will
not
be
right
to
stop
them
or
delay
their
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentle
sir
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
you
go
and
mind
your
tame
partridge
*NL*
and
your
bold
ferret
,
and
leave
everyone
to
manage
his
own
business
;
this
*NL*
is
mine
,
and
I
know
whether
these
gentlemen
the
lions
come
to
me
or
not
;
''
*NL*
and
then
turning
to
the
keeper
he
exclaimed
,
``
By
all
that
's
good
,
sir
*NL*
scoundrel
,
if
you
do
n't
open
the
cages
this
very
instant
,
I
'll
pin
you
to
*NL*
the
cart
with
this
lance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carter
,
seeing
the
determination
of
this
apparition
in
armour
,
said
*NL*
to
him
,
``
Please
your
worship
,
for
charity
's
sake
,
senor
,
let
me
unyoke
*NL*
the
mules
and
place
myself
in
safety
along
with
them
before
the
lions
are
*NL*
turned
out
;
for
if
they
kill
them
on
me
I
am
ruined
for
life
,
for
all
I
*NL*
possess
is
this
cart
and
mules
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
man
of
little
faith
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
get
down
and
unyoke
;
you
*NL*
will
soon
see
that
you
are
exerting
yourself
for
nothing
,
and
that
you
*NL*
might
have
spared
yourself
the
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carter
got
down
and
with
all
speed
unyoked
the
mules
,
and
the
keeper
*NL*
called
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
``
I
call
all
here
to
witness
that
*NL*
against
my
will
and
under
compulsion
I
open
the
cages
and
let
the
lions
*NL*
loose
,
and
that
I
warn
this
gentleman
that
he
will
be
accountable
for
all
*NL*
the
harm
and
mischief
which
these
beasts
may
do
,
and
for
my
salary
and
*NL*
dues
as
well
.
You
,
gentlemen
,
place
yourselves
in
safety
before
I
open
,
*NL*
for
I
know
they
will
do
me
no
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
the
gentleman
strove
to
persuade
Don
Quixote
not
to
do
such
a
*NL*
mad
thing
,
as
it
was
tempting
God
to
engage
in
such
a
piece
of
folly
.
To
*NL*
this
,
Don
Quixote
replied
that
he
knew
what
he
was
about
.
The
gentleman
*NL*
in
return
entreated
him
to
reflect
,
for
he
knew
he
was
under
a
delusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
senor
,
''
answered
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
you
do
not
like
to
be
a
*NL*
spectator
of
this
tragedy
,
as
in
your
opinion
it
will
be
,
spur
your
*NL*
flea-bitten
mare
,
and
place
yourself
in
safety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
,
Sancho
with
tears
in
his
eyes
entreated
him
to
give
up
an
*NL*
enterprise
compared
with
which
the
one
of
the
windmills
,
and
the
awful
*NL*
one
of
the
fulling
mills
,
and
,
in
fact
,
all
the
feats
he
had
attempted
in
*NL*
the
whole
course
of
his
life
,
were
cakes
and
fancy
bread
.
``
Look
ye
,
*NL*
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
there
's
no
enchantment
here
,
nor
anything
of
the
*NL*
sort
,
for
between
the
bars
and
chinks
of
the
cage
I
have
seen
the
paw
of
*NL*
a
real
lion
,
and
judging
by
that
I
reckon
the
lion
such
a
paw
could
*NL*
belong
to
must
be
bigger
than
a
mountain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fear
at
any
rate
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
will
make
him
look
bigger
to
*NL*
thee
than
half
the
world
.
Retire
,
Sancho
,
and
leave
me
;
and
if
I
die
here
*NL*
thou
knowest
our
old
compact
;
thou
wilt
repair
to
Dulcinea
--
I
say
no
*NL*
more
.
''
To
these
he
added
some
further
words
that
banished
all
hope
of
his
*NL*
giving
up
his
insane
project
.
He
of
the
green
gaban
would
have
offered
*NL*
resistance
,
but
he
found
himself
ill-matched
as
to
arms
,
and
did
not
*NL*
think
it
prudent
to
come
to
blows
with
a
madman
,
for
such
Don
Quixote
now
*NL*
showed
himself
to
be
in
every
respect
;
and
the
latter
,
renewing
his
*NL*
commands
to
the
keeper
and
repeating
his
threats
,
gave
warning
to
the
*NL*
gentleman
to
spur
his
mare
,
Sancho
his
Dapple
,
and
the
carter
his
mules
,
*NL*
all
striving
to
get
away
from
the
cart
as
far
as
they
could
before
the
*NL*
lions
broke
loose
.
Sancho
was
weeping
over
his
master
's
death
,
for
this
*NL*
time
he
firmly
believed
it
was
in
store
for
him
from
the
claws
of
the
*NL*
lions
;
and
he
cursed
his
fate
and
called
it
an
unlucky
hour
when
he
*NL*
thought
of
taking
service
with
him
again
;
but
with
all
his
tears
and
*NL*
lamentations
he
did
not
forget
to
thrash
Dapple
so
as
to
put
a
good
space
*NL*
between
himself
and
the
cart
.
The
keeper
,
seeing
that
the
fugitives
were
*NL*
now
some
distance
off
,
once
more
entreated
and
warned
him
as
before
;
but
*NL*
he
replied
that
he
heard
him
,
and
that
he
need
not
trouble
himself
with
*NL*
any
further
warnings
or
entreaties
,
as
they
would
be
fruitless
,
and
bade
*NL*
him
make
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
delay
that
occurred
while
the
keeper
was
opening
the
first
*NL*
cage
,
Don
Quixote
was
considering
whether
it
would
not
be
well
to
do
*NL*
battle
on
foot
,
instead
of
on
horseback
,
and
finally
resolved
to
fight
on
*NL*
foot
,
fearing
that
Rocinante
might
take
fright
at
the
sight
of
the
lions
;
*NL*
he
therefore
sprang
off
his
horse
,
flung
his
lance
aside
,
braced
his
*NL*
buckler
on
his
arm
,
and
drawing
his
sword
,
advanced
slowly
with
*NL*
marvellous
intrepidity
and
resolute
courage
,
to
plant
himself
in
front
of
*NL*
the
cart
,
commending
himself
with
all
his
heart
to
God
and
to
his
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
to
be
observed
,
that
on
coming
to
this
passage
,
the
author
of
this
*NL*
veracious
history
breaks
out
into
exclamations
.
``
O
doughty
Don
Quixote
!
*NL*
high-mettled
past
extolling
!
Mirror
,
wherein
all
the
heroes
of
the
world
*NL*
may
see
themselves
!
Second
modern
Don
Manuel
de
Leon
,
once
the
glory
and
*NL*
honour
of
Spanish
knighthood
!
In
what
words
shall
I
describe
this
dread
*NL*
exploit
,
by
what
language
shall
I
make
it
credible
to
ages
to
come
,
what
*NL*
eulogies
are
there
unmeet
for
thee
,
though
they
be
hyperboles
piled
on
*NL*
hyperboles
!
On
foot
,
alone
,
undaunted
,
high-souled
,
with
but
a
simple
*NL*
sword
,
and
that
no
trenchant
blade
of
the
Perrillo
brand
,
a
shield
,
but
*NL*
no
bright
polished
steel
one
,
there
stoodst
thou
,
biding
and
awaiting
the
*NL*
two
fiercest
lions
that
Africa
's
forests
ever
bred
!
Thy
own
deeds
be
thy
*NL*
praise
,
valiant
Manchegan
,
and
here
I
leave
them
as
they
stand
,
wanting
*NL*
the
words
wherewith
to
glorify
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
author
's
outburst
came
to
an
end
,
and
he
proceeded
to
take
up
*NL*
the
thread
of
his
story
,
saying
that
the
keeper
,
seeing
that
Don
Quixote
*NL*
had
taken
up
his
position
,
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
avoid
*NL*
letting
out
the
male
without
incurring
the
enmity
of
the
fiery
and
daring
*NL*
knight
,
flung
open
the
doors
of
the
first
cage
,
containing
,
as
has
been
*NL*
said
,
the
lion
,
which
was
now
seen
to
be
of
enormous
size
,
and
grim
and
*NL*
hideous
mien
.
The
first
thing
he
did
was
to
turn
round
in
the
cage
in
*NL*
which
he
lay
,
and
protrude
his
claws
,
and
stretch
himself
thoroughly
;
he
*NL*
next
opened
his
mouth
,
and
yawned
very
leisurely
,
and
with
near
two
*NL*
palms
'
length
of
tongue
that
he
had
thrust
forth
,
he
licked
the
dust
out
*NL*
of
his
eyes
and
washed
his
face
;
having
done
this
,
he
put
his
head
out
of
*NL*
the
cage
and
looked
all
round
with
eyes
like
glowing
coals
,
a
spectacle
*NL*
and
demeanour
to
strike
terror
into
temerity
itself
.
Don
Quixote
merely
*NL*
observed
him
steadily
,
longing
for
him
to
leap
from
the
cart
and
come
to
*NL*
close
quarters
with
him
,
when
he
hoped
to
hew
him
in
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
did
his
unparalleled
madness
go
;
but
the
noble
lion
,
more
*NL*
courteous
than
arrogant
,
not
troubling
himself
about
silly
bravado
,
after
*NL*
having
looked
all
round
,
as
has
been
said
,
turned
about
and
presented
his
*NL*
hind-quarters
to
Don
Quixote
,
and
very
coolly
and
tranquilly
lay
down
*NL*
again
in
the
cage
.
Seeing
this
,
Don
Quixote
ordered
the
keeper
to
take
a
*NL*
stick
to
him
and
provoke
him
to
make
him
come
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
the
keeper
;
``
for
if
I
anger
him
,
the
first
he
'll
*NL*
tear
in
pieces
will
be
myself
.
Be
satisfied
,
sir
knight
,
with
what
you
*NL*
have
done
,
which
leaves
nothing
more
to
be
said
on
the
score
of
courage
,
*NL*
and
do
not
seek
to
tempt
fortune
a
second
time
.
The
lion
has
the
door
*NL*
open
;
he
is
free
to
come
out
or
not
to
come
out
;
but
as
he
has
not
come
*NL*
out
so
far
,
he
will
not
come
out
to-day
.
Your
worship
's
great
courage
has
*NL*
been
fully
manifested
already
;
no
brave
champion
,
so
it
strikes
me
,
is
*NL*
bound
to
do
more
than
challenge
his
enemy
and
wait
for
him
on
the
field
;
*NL*
if
his
adversary
does
not
come
,
on
him
lies
the
disgrace
,
and
he
who
*NL*
waits
for
him
carries
off
the
crown
of
victory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
close
the
door
,
my
friend
,
and
let
me
*NL*
have
,
in
the
best
form
thou
canst
,
what
thou
hast
seen
me
do
,
by
way
of
*NL*
certificate
;
to
wit
,
that
thou
didst
open
for
the
lion
,
that
I
waited
for
*NL*
him
,
that
he
did
not
come
out
,
that
I
still
waited
for
him
,
and
that
*NL*
still
he
did
not
come
out
,
and
lay
down
again
.
I
am
not
bound
to
do
more
;
*NL*
enchantments
avaunt
,
and
God
uphold
the
right
,
the
truth
,
and
true
*NL*
chivalry
!
Close
the
door
as
I
bade
thee
,
while
I
make
signals
to
the
*NL*
fugitives
that
have
left
us
,
that
they
may
learn
this
exploit
from
thy
*NL*
lips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
keeper
obeyed
,
and
Don
Quixote
,
fixing
on
the
point
of
his
lance
the
*NL*
cloth
he
had
wiped
his
face
with
after
the
deluge
of
curds
,
proceeded
to
*NL*
recall
the
others
,
who
still
continued
to
fly
,
looking
back
at
every
*NL*
step
,
all
in
a
body
,
the
gentleman
bringing
up
the
rear
.
Sancho
,
however
,
*NL*
happening
to
observe
the
signal
of
the
white
cloth
,
exclaimed
,
``
May
I
*NL*
die
,
if
my
master
has
not
overcome
the
wild
beasts
,
for
he
is
calling
to
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
stopped
,
and
perceived
that
it
was
Don
Quixote
who
was
making
*NL*
signals
,
and
shaking
off
their
fears
to
some
extent
,
they
approached
*NL*
slowly
until
they
were
near
enough
to
hear
distinctly
Don
Quixote
's
voice
*NL*
calling
to
them
.
They
returned
at
length
to
the
cart
,
and
as
they
came
*NL*
up
,
Don
Quixote
said
to
the
carter
,
``
Put
your
mules
to
once
more
,
*NL*
brother
,
and
continue
your
journey
;
and
do
thou
,
Sancho
,
give
him
two
*NL*
gold
crowns
for
himself
and
the
keeper
,
to
compensate
for
the
delay
they
*NL*
have
incurred
through
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
I
give
with
all
my
heart
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
what
has
become
*NL*
of
the
lions
?
Are
they
dead
or
alive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
keeper
,
then
,
in
full
detail
,
and
bit
by
bit
,
described
the
end
of
*NL*
the
contest
,
exalting
to
the
best
of
his
power
and
ability
the
valour
of
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
at
the
sight
of
whom
the
lion
quailed
,
and
would
not
and
*NL*
dared
not
come
out
of
the
cage
,
although
he
had
held
the
door
open
ever
*NL*
so
long
;
and
showing
how
,
in
consequence
of
his
having
represented
to
the
*NL*
knight
that
it
was
tempting
God
to
provoke
the
lion
in
order
to
force
him
*NL*
out
,
which
he
wished
to
have
done
,
he
very
reluctantly
,
and
altogether
*NL*
against
his
will
,
had
allowed
the
door
to
be
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dost
thou
think
of
this
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
``
Are
there
any
*NL*
enchantments
that
can
prevail
against
true
valour
?
The
enchanters
may
be
*NL*
able
to
rob
me
of
good
fortune
,
but
of
fortitude
and
courage
they
*NL*
can
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
paid
the
crowns
,
the
carter
put
to
,
the
keeper
kissed
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
hands
for
the
bounty
bestowed
upon
him
,
and
promised
to
give
an
*NL*
account
of
the
valiant
exploit
to
the
King
himself
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
*NL*
at
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
his
Majesty
should
happen
to
ask
who
*NL*
performed
it
,
you
must
say
THE
KNIGHT
OF
THE
LIONS
;
for
it
is
my
desire
*NL*
that
into
this
the
name
I
have
hitherto
borne
of
Knight
of
the
Rueful
*NL*
Countenance
be
from
this
time
forward
changed
,
altered
,
transformed
,
and
*NL*
turned
;
and
in
this
I
follow
the
ancient
usage
of
knights-errant
,
who
*NL*
changed
their
names
when
they
pleased
,
or
when
it
suited
their
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cart
went
its
way
,
and
Don
Quixote
,
Sancho
,
and
he
of
the
green
gaban
*NL*
went
theirs
.
All
this
time
,
Don
Diego
de
Miranda
had
not
spoken
a
word
,
*NL*
being
entirely
taken
up
with
observing
and
noting
all
that
Don
Quixote
*NL*
did
and
said
,
and
the
opinion
he
formed
was
that
he
was
a
man
of
brains
*NL*
gone
mad
,
and
a
madman
on
the
verge
of
rationality
.
The
first
part
of
his
*NL*
history
had
not
yet
reached
him
,
for
,
had
he
read
it
,
the
amazement
with
*NL*
which
his
words
and
deeds
filled
him
would
have
vanished
,
as
he
would
*NL*
then
have
understood
the
nature
of
his
madness
;
but
knowing
nothing
of
*NL*
it
,
he
took
him
to
be
rational
one
moment
,
and
crazy
the
next
,
for
what
*NL*
he
said
was
sensible
,
elegant
,
and
well
expressed
,
and
what
he
did
,
*NL*
absurd
,
rash
,
and
foolish
;
and
said
he
to
himself
,
``
What
could
be
madder
*NL*
than
putting
on
a
helmet
full
of
curds
,
and
then
persuading
oneself
that
*NL*
enchanters
are
softening
one
's
skull
;
or
what
could
be
greater
rashness
*NL*
and
folly
than
wanting
to
fight
lions
tooth
and
nail
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
roused
him
from
these
reflections
and
this
soliloquy
by
*NL*
saying
,
``
No
doubt
,
Senor
Don
Diego
de
Miranda
,
you
set
me
down
in
your
*NL*
mind
as
a
fool
and
a
madman
,
and
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
you
did
,
for
my
*NL*
deeds
do
not
argue
anything
else
.
But
for
all
that
,
I
would
have
you
take
*NL*
notice
that
I
am
neither
so
mad
nor
so
foolish
as
I
must
have
seemed
to
*NL*
you
.
A
gallant
knight
shows
to
advantage
bringing
his
lance
to
bear
*NL*
adroitly
upon
a
fierce
bull
under
the
eyes
of
his
sovereign
,
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
a
spacious
plaza
;
a
knight
shows
to
advantage
arrayed
in
glittering
*NL*
armour
,
pacing
the
lists
before
the
ladies
in
some
joyous
tournament
,
and
*NL*
all
those
knights
show
to
advantage
that
entertain
,
divert
,
and
,
if
we
*NL*
may
say
so
,
honour
the
courts
of
their
princes
by
warlike
exercises
,
or
*NL*
what
resemble
them
;
but
to
greater
advantage
than
all
these
does
a
*NL*
knight-errant
show
when
he
traverses
deserts
,
solitudes
,
cross-roads
,
*NL*
forests
,
and
mountains
,
in
quest
of
perilous
adventures
,
bent
on
bringing
*NL*
them
to
a
happy
and
successful
issue
,
all
to
win
a
glorious
and
lasting
*NL*
renown
.
To
greater
advantage
,
I
maintain
,
does
the
knight-errant
show
*NL*
bringing
aid
to
some
widow
in
some
lonely
waste
,
than
the
court
knight
*NL*
dallying
with
some
city
damsel
.
All
knights
have
their
own
special
parts
*NL*
to
play
;
let
the
courtier
devote
himself
to
the
ladies
,
let
him
add
*NL*
lustre
to
his
sovereign
's
court
by
his
liveries
,
let
him
entertain
poor
*NL*
gentlemen
with
the
sumptuous
fare
of
his
table
,
let
him
arrange
*NL*
joustings
,
marshal
tournaments
,
and
prove
himself
noble
,
generous
,
and
*NL*
magnificent
,
and
above
all
a
good
Christian
,
and
so
doing
he
will
fulfil
*NL*
the
duties
that
are
especially
his
;
but
let
the
knight-errant
explore
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
earth
and
penetrate
the
most
intricate
labyrinths
,
at
each
*NL*
step
let
him
attempt
impossibilities
,
on
desolate
heaths
let
him
endure
*NL*
the
burning
rays
of
the
midsummer
sun
,
and
the
bitter
inclemency
of
the
*NL*
winter
winds
and
frosts
;
let
no
lions
daunt
him
,
no
monsters
terrify
him
,
*NL*
no
dragons
make
him
quail
;
for
to
seek
these
,
to
attack
those
,
and
to
*NL*
vanquish
all
,
are
in
truth
his
main
duties
.
I
,
then
,
as
it
has
fallen
to
*NL*
my
lot
to
be
a
member
of
knight-errantry
,
can
not
avoid
attempting
all
*NL*
that
to
me
seems
to
come
within
the
sphere
of
my
duties
;
thus
it
was
my
*NL*
bounden
duty
to
attack
those
lions
that
I
just
now
attacked
,
although
I
*NL*
knew
it
to
be
the
height
of
rashness
;
for
I
know
well
what
valour
is
,
*NL*
that
it
is
a
virtue
that
occupies
a
place
between
two
vicious
extremes
,
*NL*
cowardice
and
temerity
;
but
it
will
be
a
lesser
evil
for
him
who
is
*NL*
valiant
to
rise
till
he
reaches
the
point
of
rashness
,
than
to
sink
until
*NL*
he
reaches
the
point
of
cowardice
;
for
,
as
it
is
easier
for
the
prodigal
*NL*
than
for
the
miser
to
become
generous
,
so
it
is
easier
for
a
rash
man
to
*NL*
prove
truly
valiant
than
for
a
coward
to
rise
to
true
valour
;
and
believe
*NL*
me
,
Senor
Don
Diego
,
in
attempting
adventures
it
is
better
to
lose
by
a
*NL*
card
too
many
than
by
a
card
too
few
;
for
to
hear
it
said
,
`
such
a
knight
*NL*
is
rash
and
daring
,
'
sounds
better
than
`
such
a
knight
is
timid
and
*NL*
cowardly
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
protest
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
''
said
Don
Diego
,
``
everything
you
have
said
*NL*
and
done
is
proved
correct
by
the
test
of
reason
itself
;
and
I
believe
,
*NL*
if
the
laws
and
ordinances
of
knight-errantry
should
be
lost
,
they
might
*NL*
be
found
in
your
worship
's
breast
as
in
their
own
proper
depository
and
*NL*
muniment-house
;
but
let
us
make
haste
,
and
reach
my
village
,
where
you
*NL*
shall
take
rest
after
your
late
exertions
;
for
if
they
have
not
been
of
*NL*
the
body
they
have
been
of
the
spirit
,
and
these
sometimes
tend
to
*NL*
produce
bodily
fatigue

;
and
pressing
forward
at
a

pace
than
before
,
*NL*
at
about
two
in
the
afternoon
they
reached
the
village
and
house
of

CHAPTER
XVIII

*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
DON
QUIXOTE
IN
THE
CASTLE
OR
HOUSE
OF
THE
KNIGHT
OF
THE
*NL*
GREEN
GABAN
,
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
MATTERS
OUT
OF
THE
COMMON
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
found
Don
Diego
de
Miranda
's
house
built
in
village
style
,
*NL*
with
his
arms
in
rough
stone
over
the
street
door
;
in
the
patio
was
the
*NL*
store-room
,
and
at
the
entrance
the
cellar
,
with
plenty
of
wine-jars
*NL*
standing
round
,
which
,
coming
from
El
Toboso
,
brought
back
to
his
memory
*NL*
his
enchanted
and
transformed
Dulcinea
;
and
with
a
sigh
,
and
not
thinking
*NL*
of
what
he
was
saying
,
or
in
whose
presence
he
was
,
he
exclaimed
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
ye
sweet
treasures
,
to
my
sorrow
found
!
*NL*
Once
sweet
and
welcome
when
't
was
heaven
's
good-will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
ye
Tobosan
jars
,
how
ye
bring
back
to
my
memory
the
*NL*
sweet
object
of
my
bitter
regrets
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
student
poet
,
Don
Diego
's
son
,
who
had
come
out
with
his
mother
to
*NL*
receive
him
,
heard
this
exclamation
,
and
both
mother
and
son
were
filled
*NL*
with
amazement
at
the
extraordinary
figure
he
presented
;
he
,
however
,
*NL*
dismounting
from
Rocinante
,
advanced
with
great
politeness
to
ask
*NL*
permission
to
kiss
the
lady
's
hand
,
while
Don
Diego
said
,
``
Senora
,
pray
*NL*
receive
with
your
wonted
kindness
Senor
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
whom
*NL*
you
see
before
you
,
a
knight-errant
,
and
the
bravest
and
wisest
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
,
whose
name
was
Dona
Christina
,
received
him
with
every
sign
of
*NL*
good-will
and
great
courtesy
,
and
Don
Quixote
placed
himself
at
her
*NL*
service
with
an
abundance
of
well-chosen
and
polished
phrases
.
Almost
the
*NL*
same
civilities
were
exchanged
between
him
and
the
student
,
who
listening
*NL*
to
Don
Quixote
,
took
him
to
be
a
sensible
,
clear-headed
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
author
describes
minutely
everything
belonging
to
Don
Diego
's
*NL*
mansion
,
putting
before
us
in
his
picture
the
whole
contents
of
a
rich
*NL*
gentleman-farmer
's
house
;
but
the
translator
of
the
history
thought
it
*NL*
best
to
pass
over
these
and
other
details
of
the
same
sort
in
silence
,
as
*NL*
they
are
not
in
harmony
with
the
main
purpose
of
the
story
,
the
strong
*NL*
point
of
which
is
truth
rather
than
dull
digressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
led
Don
Quixote
into
a
room
,
and
Sancho
removed
his
armour
,
leaving
*NL*
him
in
loose
Walloon
breeches
and
chamois-leather
doublet
,
all
stained
*NL*
with
the
rust
of
his
armour
;
his
collar
was
a
falling
one
of
scholastic
*NL*
cut
,
without
starch
or
lace
,
his
buskins
buff-coloured
,
and
his
shoes
*NL*
polished
.
He
wore
his
good
sword
,
which
hung
in
a
baldric
of
sea-wolf
's
*NL*
skin
,
for
he
had
suffered
for
many
years
,
they
say
,
from
an
ailment
of
*NL*
the
kidneys
;
and
over
all
he
threw
a
long
cloak
of
good
grey
cloth
.
But
*NL*
first
of
all
,
with
five
or
six
buckets
of
water
-LRB-
for
as
regard
the
number
*NL*
of
buckets
there
is
some
dispute
-RRB-
,
he
washed
his
head
and
face
,
and
still
*NL*
the
water
remained
whey-coloured
,
thanks
to
Sancho
's
greediness
and
*NL*
purchase
of
those
unlucky
curds
that
turned
his
master
so
white
.
Thus
*NL*
arrayed
,
and
with
an
easy
,
sprightly
,
and
gallant
air
,
Don
Quixote
passed
*NL*
out
into
another
room
,
where
the
student
was
waiting
to
entertain
him
*NL*
while
the
table
was
being
laid
;
for
on
the
arrival
of
so
distinguished
a
*NL*
guest
,
Dona
Christina
was
anxious
to
show
that
she
knew
how
and
was
able
*NL*
to
give
a
becoming
reception
to
those
who
came
to
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Don
Quixote
was
taking
off
his
armour
,
Don
Lorenzo
-LRB-
for
so
Don
*NL*
Diego
's
son
was
called
-RRB-
took
the
opportunity
to
say
to
his
father
,
``
What
*NL*
are
we
to
make
of
this
gentleman
you
have
brought
home
to
us
,
sir
?
For
*NL*
his
name
,
his
appearance
,
and
your
describing
him
as
a
knight-errant
have
*NL*
completely
puzzled
my
mother
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
,
my
son
,
''
replied
.
Don
Diego
;
``
all
I
can
tell
*NL*
thee
is
that
I
have
seen
him
act
the
acts
of
the
greatest
madman
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
heard
him
make
observations
so
sensible
that
they
efface
and
*NL*
undo
all
he
does
;
do
thou
talk
to
him
and
feel
the
pulse
of
his
wits
,
and
*NL*
as
thou
art
shrewd
,
form
the
most
reasonable
conclusion
thou
canst
as
to
*NL*
his
wisdom
or
folly
;
though
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
am
more
inclined
to
*NL*
take
him
to
be
mad
than
sane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
Don
Lorenzo
went
away
to
entertain
Don
Quixote
as
has
been
*NL*
said
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
that
passed
between
them
Don
*NL*
Quixote
said
to
Don
Lorenzo
,
``
Your
father
,
Senor
Don
Diego
de
Miranda
,
*NL*
has
told
me
of
the
rare
abilities
and
subtle
intellect
you
possess
,
and
,
*NL*
above
all
,
that
you
are
a
great
poet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
poet
,
it
may
be
,
''
replied
Don
Lorenzo
,
``
but
a
great
one
,
by
no
means
.
*NL*
It
is
true
that
I
am
somewhat
given
to
poetry
and
to
reading
good
poets
,
*NL*
but
not
so
much
so
as
to
justify
the
title
of
`
great
'
which
my
father
*NL*
gives
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
dislike
that
modesty
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
there
is
no
poet
*NL*
who
is
not
conceited
and
does
not
think
he
is
the
best
poet
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
rule
without
an
exception
,
''
said
Don
Lorenzo
;
``
there
may
be
*NL*
some
who
are
poets
and
yet
do
not
think
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
few
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
tell
me
,
what
verses
are
those
which
*NL*
you
have
now
in
hand
,
and
which
your
father
tells
me
keep
you
somewhat
*NL*
restless
and
absorbed
?
If
it
be
some
gloss
,
I
know
something
about
*NL*
glosses
,
and
I
should
like
to
hear
them
;
and
if
they
are
for
a
poetical
*NL*
tournament
,
contrive
to
carry
off
the
second
prize
;
for
the
first
always
*NL*
goes
by
favour
or
personal
standing
,
the
second
by
simple
justice
;
and
so
*NL*
the
third
comes
to
be
the
second
,
and
the
first
,
reckoning
in
this
way
,
*NL*
will
be
third
,
in
the
same
way
as
licentiate
degrees
are
conferred
at
the
*NL*
universities
;
but
,
for
all
that
,
the
title
of
first
is
a
great
*NL*
distinction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
,
''
said
Don
Lorenzo
to
himself
,
``
I
should
not
take
you
to
be
a
*NL*
madman
;
but
let
us
go
on
.
''
So
he
said
to
him
,
``
Your
worship
has
*NL*
apparently
attended
the
schools
;
what
sciences
have
you
studied
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
of
knight-errantry
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
which
is
as
good
as
that
of
*NL*
poetry
,
and
even
a
finger
or
two
above
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
science
that
is
,
''
said
Don
Lorenzo
,
``
and
until
now
I
*NL*
have
never
heard
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
science
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
comprehends
in
itself
all
or
*NL*
most
of
the
sciences
in
the
world
,
for
he
who
professes
it
must
be
a
*NL*
jurist
,
and
must
know
the
rules
of
justice
,
distributive
and
equitable
,
*NL*
so
as
to
give
to
each
one
what
belongs
to
him
and
is
due
to
him
.
He
must
*NL*
be
a
theologian
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
give
a
clear
and
distinctive
reason
*NL*
for
the
Christian
faith
he
professes
,
wherever
it
may
be
asked
of
him
.
He
*NL*
must
be
a
physician
,
and
above
all
a
herbalist
,
so
as
in
wastes
and
*NL*
solitudes
to
know
the
herbs
that
have
the
property
of
healing
wounds
,
for
*NL*
a
knight-errant
must
not
go
looking
for
some
one
to
cure
him
at
every
*NL*
step
.
He
must
be
an
astronomer
,
so
as
to
know
by
the
stars
how
many
hours
*NL*
of
the
night
have
passed
,
and
what
clime
and
quarter
of
the
world
he
is
*NL*
in
.
He
must
know
mathematics
,
for
at
every
turn
some
occasion
for
them
*NL*
will
present
itself
to
him
;
and
,
putting
it
aside
that
he
must
be
adorned
*NL*
with
all
the
virtues
,
cardinal
and
theological
,
to
come
down
to
minor
*NL*
particulars
,
he
must
,
I
say
,
be
able
to
swim
as
well
as
Nicholas
or
*NL*
Nicolao
the
Fish
could
,
as
the
story
goes
;
he
must
know
how
to
shoe
a
*NL*
horse
,
and
repair
his
saddle
and
bridle
;
and
,
to
return
to
higher
*NL*
matters
,
he
must
be
faithful
to
God
and
to
his
lady
;
he
must
be
pure
in
*NL*
thought
,
decorous
in
words
,
generous
in
works
,
valiant
in
deeds
,
patient
*NL*
in
suffering
,
compassionate
towards
the
needy
,
and
,
lastly
,
an
upholder
*NL*
of
the
truth
though
its
defence
should
cost
him
his
life
.
Of
all
these
*NL*
qualities
,
great
and
small
,
is
a
true
knight-errant
made
up
;
judge
then
,
*NL*
Senor
Don
Lorenzo
,
whether
it
be
a
contemptible
science
which
the
knight
*NL*
who
studies
and
professes
it
has
to
learn
,
and
whether
it
may
not
compare
*NL*
with
the
very
loftiest
that
are
taught
in
the
schools
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
be
so
,
''
replied
Don
Lorenzo
,
``
this
science
,
I
protest
,
surpasses
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
if
that
be
so
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
mean
to
say
,
''
said
Don
Lorenzo
,
``
is
,
that
I
doubt
whether
there
*NL*
are
now

or
ever
were

any
knights-errant
,
and
adorned
with
such
*NL*
virtues
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
a
time
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
have
I
said
what
I
now
say
once
*NL*
more
,
that
the
majority
of
the
world
are
of
opinion
that
there
never
were
*NL*
any
knights-errant
in
it
;
and
as
it
is
my
opinion
that
,
unless
heaven
by
*NL*
some
miracle
brings
home
to
them
the
truth
that
there
were
and
are
,
all
*NL*
the
pains
one
takes
will
be
in
vain
-LRB-
as
experience
has
often
proved
to
*NL*
me
-RRB-
,
I
will
not
now
stop
to
disabuse
you
of
the
error
you
share
with
the
*NL*
multitude
.
All
I
shall
do
is
to
pray
to
heaven
to
deliver
you
from
it
,
*NL*
and
show
you
how
beneficial
and
necessary
knights-errant
were
in
days
of
*NL*
yore
,
and
how
useful
they
would
be
in
these
days
were
they

in
vogue
;
*NL*
but
now
,
for
the
sins
of
the
people
,
sloth
and
indolence
,
gluttony
and
*NL*
luxury
are
triumphant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
guest
has
broken
out
on
our
hands
,
''
said
Don
Lorenzo
to
himself
at
*NL*
this
point
;
``
but
,
for
all
that
,
he
is
a
glorious
madman
,

I
should
be
*NL*
a
dull
blockhead
to
doubt
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
being
summoned
to
dinner
,
they
brought
their
colloquy
to
a
close
.
*NL*
Don
Diego
asked
his
son
what
he
had
been
able
to
make
out
as
to
the
wits
*NL*
of
their
guest
.
To
which
he
replied
,
``
All
the
doctors
and
clever
scribes
*NL*
in
the
world
will
not
make
sense
of
the
scrawl
of
his
madness
;
he
is
a
*NL*
madman
full
of
streaks
,
full
of
lucid
intervals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
in
to
dinner
,
and
the
repast
was
such
as
Don
Diego
said
on
the
*NL*
road
he
was
in
the
habit
of
giving
to
his
guests
,
neat
,
plentiful
,
and
*NL*
tasty
;
but
what
pleased
Don
Quixote
most
was
the
marvellous
silence
that
*NL*
reigned
throughout
the
house
,
for
it
was
like
a
Carthusian
monastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
cloth
had
been
removed
,
grace
said
and
their
hands
washed
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
earnestly
pressed
Don
Lorenzo
to
repeat
to
him
his
verses
for
the
*NL*
poetical
tournament
,
to
which
he
replied
,
``
Not
to
be
like
those
poets
*NL*
who
,
when
they
are
asked
to
recite
their
verses
,
refuse
,
and
when
they
*NL*
are
not
asked
for
them
vomit
them
up
,
I
will
repeat
my
gloss
,
for
which
I
*NL*
do
not
expect
any
prize
,
having
composed
it
merely
as
an
exercise
of
*NL*
ingenuity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
discerning
friend
of
mine
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
was
of
opinion
that
no
*NL*
one
ought
to
waste
labour
in
glossing
verses
;
and
the
reason
he
gave
was
*NL*
that
the
gloss
can
never
come
up
to
the
text
,
and
that
often
or
most
*NL*
frequently
it
wanders
away
from
the
meaning
and
purpose
aimed
at
in
the
*NL*
glossed
lines
;
and
besides
,
that
the
laws
of
the
gloss
were
too
strict
,
*NL*
as
they
did
not
allow
interrogations
,
nor
`
said
he
,
'
nor
'
I
say
,
'
nor
*NL*
turning
verbs
into
nouns
,
or
altering
the
construction
,
not
to
speak
of
*NL*
other
restrictions

limitations

When
Don
Lorenzo
had
finished
reciting
his
gloss
,
Don
Quixote
stood
up
,
*NL*
and
in
a
loud
voice
,
almost
a
shout
,
exclaimed
as
he
grasped
Don
*NL*
Lorenzo
's
right
hand
in
his
,
``
By
the
highest
heavens
,
noble
youth
,
but
*NL*
you
are
the

*NL*
not
by

God
forgive

if
they
still
flourished

by
those
that

Repeat
me
some
*NL*
of
your

senor

''
*NL*
*NL*
Is
there
any
need
to
say
that
Don
Lorenzo
enjoyed
hearing
himself
praised
*NL*
by
Don
Quixote
,
albeit
he
looked
upon
him
as
a
madman
?
power
of
flattery
,
*NL*
how
far-reaching
art
thou
,
and
how
wide
are
the
bounds
of
thy
pleasant
*NL*
jurisdiction
!
Don
Lorenzo
gave
a
proof
of
it
,
for
he
complied
with
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
request
and
entreaty
,
and
repeated
to
him
this
sonnet
on
the
*NL*
fable
or
story
of
Pyramus

Thisbe
.

*NL*
SONNET

The

maid
,
she
pierces
now
the

Heart-pierced
by
her
young
Pyramus
doth
lie
;
*NL*
And
Love
spreads
wing
from
Cyprus
isle
to
fly
,
*NL*
A
chink
to

so
wondrous
great
and
small
.
*NL*
There
silence
speaketh

for

Can

so
strait

will
ply

Where

For

will
find

whate'er
befall

*NL*
Impatient
of

,
with
reckless
pace
*NL*
The
rash
maid
wins
the
fatal
spot
where
she
*NL*
Sinks
not
in

's
arms
but
death

*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessed
be
God
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
when
he
had
heard
Don
Lorenzo
's
*NL*
sonnet
,
``
that
among
the
hosts
there
are
of
irritable
poets
I
have
found
*NL*
one

the

of
this

proves
to
me
*NL*
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
For
four
days
was
Don
Quixote
most
sumptuously
entertained
in
Don
Diego
's
*NL*
house
,
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
asked
his
permission
to
depart
,
*NL*
telling
him
he
thanked
him
for
the
kindness
and
hospitality
he
had
*NL*
received
in
his
house
,
but
that
,
as
it
did
not
become
knights-errant
to
*NL*
give
themselves
up
for
long
to
idleness
and
luxury
,
he
was
anxious
to
*NL*
fulfill
the
duties
of
his
calling
in
seeking
adventures
,
of
which
he
was
*NL*
informed
there
was
an
abundance
in
that
neighbourhood
,
where
he
hoped
to
*NL*
employ
his
time
until
the
day
came
round
for
the
jousts
at
Saragossa
,
for
*NL*
that
was
his
proper
destination
;
and
that
,
first
of
all
,
he
meant
to
*NL*
enter
the
cave
of
Montesinos
,
of
which
so
many
marvellous
things
were
*NL*
reported
all
through
the
country
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
investigate
and
*NL*
explore
the
origin
and
true
source
of
the
seven
lakes
commonly
called
the
*NL*
lakes
of
Ruidera
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Diego
and
his
son
commended
his
laudable
resolution
,
and
bade
him
*NL*
furnish
himself
with
all
he
wanted
from
their
house
and
belongings
,
as
*NL*
they
would
most
gladly
be
of
service
to
him
;
which
,
indeed
,
his
personal
*NL*
worth
and
his
honourable
profession
made
incumbent
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
of
his
departure
came
at
length
,
as
welcome
to
Don
Quixote
as
it
*NL*
was
sad
and
sorrowful
to
Sancho
Panza
,
who
was
very
well
satisfied
with
*NL*
the
abundance
of
Don
Diego
's
house
,
and
objected
to
return
to
the
*NL*
starvation
of
the
woods
and
wilds
and
the
short-commons
of
his
*NL*
ill-stocked
alforjas
;
these
,
however
,
he
filled
and
packed
with
what
he
*NL*
considered
needful
.
On
taking
leave
,
Don
Quixote
said
to
Don
Lorenzo
,
``
I
*NL*
know
not
whether
I
have
told
you
already
,
but
if
I
have
I
tell
you
once
*NL*
more
,
that
if
you
wish
to
spare
yourself
fatigue
and
toil
in
reaching
the
*NL*
inaccessible
summit
of
the
temple
of
fame
,
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
*NL*
turn
aside
out
of
the
somewhat
narrow
path
of
poetry
and
take
the
still
*NL*
narrower
one
of
knight-errantry
,
wide
enough
,
however
,
to
make
you
an
*NL*
emperor
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
speech
Don
Quixote
wound
up
the
evidence
of
his
madness
,
but
*NL*
still
better
in
what
he
added
when
he
said
,
``
God
knows
,
I
would
gladly
*NL*
take
Don
Lorenzo
with
me
to
teach
him
how
to
spare
the
humble
,
and
*NL*
trample
the
proud
under
foot
,
virtues
that
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
*NL*
profession
I
belong
to
;
but
since
his
tender
age
does
not
allow
of
it
,
*NL*
nor
his
praiseworthy
pursuits
permit
it
,
I
will
simply
content
myself
*NL*
with
impressing
it
upon
your
worship
that
you
will
become
famous
as
a
*NL*
poet
if
you
are
guided
by
the
opinion
of
others
rather
than
by
your
own
;
*NL*
because
no
fathers
or
mothers
ever
think
their
own
children
ill-favoured
,
*NL*
and
this
sort
of
deception
prevails
still
more
strongly
in
the
case
of
*NL*
the
children
of
the
brain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
father
and
son
were
amazed
afresh
at
the
strange
medley
Don
Quixote
*NL*
talked
,
at
one
moment
sense
,
at
another
nonsense
,
and
at
the
pertinacity
*NL*
and
persistence
he
displayed
in
going
through
thick
and
thin
in
quest
of
*NL*
his
unlucky
adventures
,
which
he
made
the
end
and
aim
of
his
desires
.
*NL*
There
was
a
renewal
of
offers
of
service
and
civilities
,
and
then
,
with
*NL*
the
gracious
permission
of
the
lady
of
the
castle
,
they
took
their
*NL*
departure

Don

on
Rocinante

and
Sancho
on

IN
WHICH
IS
RELATED
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
ENAMOURED
SHEPHERD
,
TOGETHER
*NL*
WITH
OTHER
TRULY
DROLL
INCIDENTS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
beyond
Don
Diego
's
village
,
*NL*
when
he
fell
in
with
a
couple
of
either
priests
or
students
,
and
a
couple
*NL*
of
peasants
,
mounted
on
four
beasts
of
the
ass
kind
.
One
of
the
students
*NL*
carried
,
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
green
buckram
by
way
of
a
portmanteau
,
*NL*
what
seemed
to
be
a
little
linen
and
a
couple
of
pairs
of
ribbed
*NL*
stockings
;
the
other
carried
nothing
but
a
pair
of
new
fencing-foils
with
*NL*
buttons
.
The
peasants
carried
divers
articles
that
showed
they
were
on
*NL*
their
way
from
some
large
town
where
they
had
bought
them
,
and
were
*NL*
taking
them
home
to
their
village
;
and
both
students
and
peasants
were
*NL*
struck
with
the
same
amazement
that
everybody
felt
who
saw
Don
Quixote
*NL*
for
the
first
time
,
and
were
dying
to
know
who
this
man
,
so
different
*NL*
from
ordinary
men
,
could
be
.
Don
Quixote
saluted
them
,
and
after
*NL*
ascertaining
that
their
road
was
the
same
as
his
,
made
them
an
offer
of
*NL*
his
company
,
and
begged
them
to
slacken
their
pace
,
as
their
young
asses
*NL*
travelled
faster
than
his
horse
;
and
then
,
to
gratify
them
,
he
told
them
*NL*
in
a
few
words
who
he
was
and
the
calling
and
profession
he
followed
,
*NL*
which
was
that
of
a
knight-errant
seeking
adventures
in
all
parts
of
the
*NL*
world
.
He
informed
them
that
his
own
name
was
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
*NL*
and
that
he
was
called
,
by
way
of
surname
,
the
Knight
of
the
Lions
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
Greek
or
gibberish
to
the
peasants
,
but
not
so
to
the
*NL*
students
,
who
very
soon
perceived
the
crack
in
Don
Quixote
's
pate
;
for
*NL*
all
that
,
however
,
they
regarded
him
with
admiration
and
respect
,
and
one
*NL*
of
them
said
to
him
,
``
If
you
,
sir
knight
,
have
no
fixed
road
,
as
it
is
*NL*
the
way
with
those
who
seek
adventures
not
to
have
any
,
let
your
worship
*NL*
come
with
us
;
you
will
see
one
of
the
finest
and
richest
weddings
that
up
*NL*
to
this
day
have
ever
been
celebrated
in
La
Mancha
,
or
for
many
a
league
*NL*
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
asked
him
if
it
was
some
prince
's
,
that
he
spoke
of
it
in
*NL*
this
way
.
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
the
student
;
``
it
is
the
wedding
of
a
farmer
*NL*
and
a
farmer
's
daughter
,
he
the
richest
in
all
this
country
,
and
she
the
*NL*
fairest
mortal
ever
set
eyes
on
.
The
display
with
which
it
is
to
be
*NL*
attended
will
be
something
rare
and
out
of
the
common
,
for
it
will
be
*NL*
celebrated
in
a
meadow
adjoining
the
town
of
the
bride
,
who
is
called
,
*NL*
par
excellence
,
Quiteria
the
fair
,
as
the
bridegroom
is
called
Camacho
*NL*
the
rich
.
She
is
eighteen
,
and
he
twenty-two
,
and
they
are
fairly
*NL*
matched
,
though
some
knowing
ones
,
who
have
all
the
pedigrees
in
the
*NL*
world
by
heart
,
will
have
it
that
the
family
of
the
fair
Quiteria
is
*NL*
better
than
Camacho
's
;
but
no
one
minds
that
now-a-days
,
for
wealth
can
*NL*
solder
a
great
many
flaws
.
At
any
rate
,
Camacho
is
free-handed
,
and
it
is
*NL*
his
fancy
to
screen
the
whole
meadow
with
boughs
and
cover
it
in
*NL*
overhead
,
so
that
the
sun
will
have
hard
work
if
he
tries
to
get
in
to
*NL*
reach
the
grass
that
covers
the
soil
.
He
has
provided
dancers
too
,
not
*NL*
only
sword
but
also
bell-dancers
,
for
in
his
own
town
there
are
those
who
*NL*
ring
the
changes
and
jingle
the
bells
to
perfection
;
of
shoe-dancers
I
*NL*
say
nothing
,
for
of
them
he
has
engaged
a
host
.
But
none
of
these
things
,
*NL*
nor
of
the
many
others
I
have
omitted
to
mention
,
will
do
more
to
make
*NL*
this
a
memorable
wedding
than
the
part
which
I
suspect
the
despairing
*NL*
Basilio
will
play
in
it
.
This
Basilio
is
a
youth
of
the
same
village
as
*NL*
Quiteria
,
and
he
lived
in
the
house
next
door
to
that
of
her
parents
,
of
*NL*
which
circumstance
Love
took
advantage
to
reproduce
to
the
word
the
*NL*
long-forgotten
loves
of
Pyramus
and
Thisbe
;
for
Basilio
loved
Quiteria
*NL*
from
his
earliest
years
,
and
she
responded
to
his
passion
with
countless
*NL*
modest
proofs
of
affection
,
so
that
the
loves
of
the
two
children
,
*NL*
Basilio
and
Quiteria
,
were
the
talk
and
the
amusement
of
the
town
.
As
*NL*
they
grew
up
,
the
father
of
Quiteria
made
up
his
mind
to
refuse
Basilio
*NL*
his
wonted
freedom
of
access
to
the
house
,
and
to
relieve
himself
of
*NL*
constant
doubts
and
suspicions
,
he
arranged
a
match
for
his
daughter
with
*NL*
the
rich
Camacho
,
as
he
did
not
approve
of
marrying
her
to
Basilio
,
who
*NL*
had
not
so
large
a
share
of
the
gifts
of
fortune
as
of
nature
;
for
if
the
*NL*
truth
be
told
ungrudgingly
,
he
is
the
most
agile
youth
we
know
,
a
mighty
*NL*
thrower
of
the
bar
,
a
first-rate
wrestler
,
and
a
great
ball-player
;
he
*NL*
runs
like
a
deer
,
and
leaps
better
than
a
goat
,
bowls
over
the
nine-pins
*NL*
as
if
by
magic
,
sings
like
a
lark
,
plays
the
guitar
so
as
to
make
it
*NL*
speak
,
and
,
above
all
,
handles
a
sword
as
well
as
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
that
excellence
alone
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
,
``
the
youth
*NL*
deserves
to
marry
,
not
merely
the
fair
Quiteria
,
but
Queen
Guinevere
*NL*
herself
,
were
she
alive
now
,
in
spite
of
Launcelot
and
all
who
would
try
*NL*
to
prevent
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
that
to
my
wife
,
''
said
Sancho
,
who
had
until
now
listened
in
*NL*
silence
,
``
for
she
wo
n't
hear
of
anything
but
each
one
marrying
his
equal

*NL*
holding
with
the
proverb
`
each
ewe
to
her

'
What
I
would
like
is
*NL*
that
this
good
Basilio
-LRB-
for
I
am
beginning
to
take
a
fancy
to
him
*NL*
already
-RRB-
should
marry
this
lady
Quiteria
;
and
a
blessing
and
good
luck
--
I
*NL*
meant
to
say
the
opposite
--
on
people
who
would
prevent
those
who
love
one
*NL*
another
from
marrying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
all
those
who
love
one
another
were
to
marry
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
it
*NL*
would
deprive
parents
of
the
right
to
choose
,
and
marry
their
children
to
*NL*
the
proper
person
and
at
the
proper
time
;
and
if
it
was
left
to
daughters
*NL*
to
choose
husbands
as
they
pleased
,
one
would
be
for
choosing
her
*NL*
father
's
servant
,
and
another
,
some
one
she
has
seen
passing
in
the
*NL*
street
and
fancies
gallant
and
dashing
,
though
he
may
be
a
drunken
bully
;
*NL*
for
love
and
fancy
easily
blind
the
eyes
of
the
judgment
,
so
much
wanted
*NL*
in
choosing
one
's
way
of
life
;
and
the
matrimonial
choice
is
very
liable
*NL*
to
error
,
and
it
needs
great
caution
and
the
special
favour
of
heaven
to
*NL*
make
it
a
good
one
.
He
who
has
to
make
a
long
journey
,
will
,
if
he
is
*NL*
wise
,
look
out
for
some
trusty
and
pleasant
companion
to
accompany
him
*NL*
before
he
sets
out
.
Why
,
then
,
should
not
he
do
the
same
who
has
to
make
*NL*
the
whole
journey
of
life
down
to
the
final
halting-place
of
death
,
more
*NL*
especially
when
the
companion
has
to
be
his
companion
in
bed
,
at
board
,
*NL*
and
everywhere
,
as
the
wife
is
to
her
husband
?
The
companionship
of
one
's
*NL*
wife
is
no
article
of
merchandise
,
that
,
after
it
has
been
bought
,
may
be
*NL*
returned
,
or
bartered
,
or
changed
;
for
it
is
an
inseparable
accident
that
*NL*
lasts
as
long
as
life
lasts
;
it
is
a
noose
that
,
once
you
put
it
round
*NL*
your
neck
,
turns
into
a
Gordian
knot
,
which
,
if
the
scythe
of
Death
does
*NL*
not
cut
it
,
there
is
no
untying
.
I
could
say
a
great
deal
more
on
this
*NL*
subject
,
were
I
not
prevented
by
the
anxiety
I
feel
to
know
if
the
senor
*NL*
licentiate
has
anything
more
to
tell
about
the
story
of
Basilio
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
student
,
bachelor
,
or
,
as
Don
Quixote
called
him
,
licentiate
,
*NL*
replied
,
``
I
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
further
,
but
that
from
the
*NL*
moment
Basilio
learned
that
the
fair
Quiteria
was
to
be
married
to
*NL*
Camacho
the
rich
,
he
has
never
been
seen
to
smile
,
or
heard
to
utter
*NL*
rational
word
,
and
he
always
goes
about
moody
and
dejected
,
talking
to
*NL*
himself
in
a
way
that
shows
plainly
he
is
out
of
his
senses
.
He
eats
*NL*
little
and
sleeps
little
,
and
all
he
eats
is
fruit
,
and
when
he
sleeps
,
*NL*
if
he
sleeps
at
all
,
it
is
in
the
field
on
the
hard
earth
like
a
brute
*NL*
beast
.
Sometimes
he
gazes
at
the
sky
,
at
other
times
he
fixes
his
eyes
on
*NL*
the
earth
in
such
an
abstracted
way
that
he
might
be
taken
for
a
clothed
*NL*
statue
,
with
its
drapery
stirred
by
the
wind
.
In
short
,
he
shows
such
*NL*
signs
of
a
heart
crushed
by
suffering
,
that
all
we
who
know
him
believe
*NL*
that
when
to-morrow
the
fair
Quiteria
says
`
yes
,
'
it
will
be
his
sentence
*NL*
of
death
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
will
guide
it
better
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
God
who
gives
the
wound
*NL*
gives
the
salve

nobody
knows
what
will
happen
;
there
are
a

many
*NL*
hours
between
this
and
to-morrow
,
and
any
one
of
them
,
or
any
moment

*NL*
house
may
fall

I
have
seen
the
rain
coming
down

sun
shining
all

at
one
time
;
many
a
one
goes
to
bed
in
good
health
who
ca
n't
stir
the
*NL*
next
day

And
tell
me
,
is
there
anyone
who
can
boast
of
having
driven
a

nail
into
the
wheel
of
fortune

No

between
a

`
yes

`
no

I
would
n't
venture
to
put
the
point

there
would
*NL*
not
be
room
for
it
;
if
you
tell
me
Quiteria
loves
Basilio
heart
and
soul
,
*NL*
then
I
'll
give
him
a
bag
of
good
luck
;
for
love

I
have
heard
say

looks
*NL*
through
spectacles
that
make
copper
seem
gold
,
poverty
wealth
,

bleary
*NL*
eyes
pearls

*NL*
``

Sancho

so
in

Why

God
bless

*NL*
it
's
not
fair
to
force
a

it
off

comes
to
polished
talk

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true

said
the
licentiate
,
``
for
those
who
have
been
bred
up
in
*NL*
the
Tanneries

not

those
who
are
almost
all
*NL*
day
pacing
the

they
are
all

Pure

correct

elegant

in
men

courtly

breeding
and
discrimination

though
they
may
have
been
born

Majalahonda

I
say
of
discrimination

there
are
many

discrimination
is
the
grammar

accompanied

bachelor
Corchuelo

returned
the

``
you
have
the
*NL*
most
mistaken
idea

it
useless

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no

Corchuelo
;
*NL*
``
and
if
you
wish
me
to
prove
it
to
you

you
have
swords

there

it
is
a
good
opportunity
;
I
have
a
steady
hand

a
strong
*NL*
arm

these
joined
with
my
resolution

is
not
small

will
make

put
in

stars
at

rude
raw
swordsmanship

next
to
God

I
*NL*
place
my
trust

the
man
is
yet
to
be
born

will
make
me
turn
my
*NL*
back

there
is
not

will
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
whether
you
turn

I
do
not

*NL*
replied
the
master
of
fence
;
``
though
it
might
be
that
your

would
be

dug
on
the
spot

planted
your

time
;
I
mean
that
*NL*
you
would
be
stretched
dead
there
for
despising
skill

the
sword

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
soon
see

replied
Corchuelo
,
and
getting
off
his
ass
briskly
,
*NL*
he
drew
out
furiously
one
of
the
swords
the
licentiate
carried
on
his
*NL*
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
not
be
that
way
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
point
;
``
I
will
be
the
*NL*
director
of
this
fencing
match
,
and
judge
of
this
often
disputed
*NL*
question
;
''
and
dismounting
from
Rocinante
and
grasping
his
lance
,
he
*NL*
planted
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
just
as
the
licentiate
,
with
*NL*
an
easy
,
graceful
bearing
and
step
,
advanced
towards
Corchuelo
,
who
came
*NL*
on
against
him
,
darting
fire
from
his
eyes
,
as
the
saying
is
.
The
other
*NL*
two
of
the
company
,
the
peasants
,
without
dismounting
from
their
asses
,
*NL*
served
as
spectators
of
the
mortal
tragedy
.
The
cuts
,
thrusts
,
down
*NL*
strokes
,
back
strokes
and
doubles
,
that
Corchuelo
delivered
were
past
*NL*
counting
,
and
came
thicker
than
hops
or
hail
.
He
attacked
like
an
angry
*NL*
lion
,
but
he
was
met
by
a
tap
on
the
mouth
from
the
button
of
the
*NL*
licentiate
's
sword
that
checked
him
in
the
midst
of
his
furious
onset
,
*NL*
and
made
him
kiss
it
as
if
it
were
a
relic
,
though
not
as
devoutly
as
*NL*
relics
are
and
ought
to
be
kissed
.
The
end
of
it
was
that
the
licentiate
*NL*
reckoned
up
for
him
by
thrusts
every
one
of
the
buttons
of
the
short
*NL*
cassock
he
wore
,
tore
the
skirts
into
strips
,
like
the
tails
of
a
*NL*
cuttlefish
,
knocked
off
his
hat
twice
,
and
so
completely
tired
him
out
,
*NL*
that
in
vexation
,
anger
,
and
rage
,
he
took
the
sword
by
the
hilt
and
*NL*
flung
it
away
with
such
force
,
that
one
of
the
peasants
that
were
there
,
*NL*
who
was
a
notary
,
and
who
went
for
it
,
made
an
affidavit
afterwards
that
*NL*
he
sent
it
nearly
three-quarters
of
a
league
,
which
testimony
will
serve
,
*NL*
and
has
served
,
to
show
and
establish
with
all
certainty
that
strength
is
*NL*
overcome
by
skill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corchuelo
sat
down
wearied
,
and
Sancho
approaching
him
said
,
``
By
my
*NL*
faith
,
senor
bachelor
,
if
your
worship
takes
my
advice

you
will
never

anyone
to
fence
again
,
only
to
wrestle
and
throw
the
bar

for
*NL*
you
have
the
youth
and
strength
for
that
;
but
as
for
these
fencers
as
*NL*
they
call
them
,
I
have
heard
say
they
can
put
the
point
of
a
sword
*NL*
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
satisfied
with
having
tumbled
off
my
donkey

said
Corchuelo
,
``

*NL*
with
having
had
the
truth
I
was
so
ignorant
of
proved
to
me
by
*NL*
experience
;

and
getting
up
he
embraced
the
licentiate
,
and
they
were
*NL*
better
friends
than
ever
;
and
not
caring
to
wait
for
the
notary
who
had
*NL*
gone
for
the
sword
,
as
they
saw
he
would
be
a
long
time
about
it
,
they
*NL*
resolved
to
push
on
so
as
to
reach
the
village
of
Quiteria
,
to
which
they
*NL*
all
belonged
,
in
good
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
remainder
of
the
journey
the
licentiate
held
forth
to
them
on
*NL*
the
excellences
of
the
sword
,
with
such
conclusive
arguments
,
and
such
*NL*
figures
and
mathematical
proofs
,
that
all
were
convinced
of
the
value
of
*NL*
the
science
,
and
Corchuelo
cured
of
his
dogmatism
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
grew
dark
;
but
before
they
reached
the
town
it
seemed
to
them
all
as
*NL*
if
there
was
a
heaven
full
of
countless
glittering
stars
in
front
of
it
.
*NL*
They
heard
,
too
,
the
pleasant
mingled
notes
of
a
variety
of
instruments
,
*NL*
flutes
,
drums
,
psalteries
,
pipes
,
tabors
,
and
timbrels
,
and
as
they
drew
*NL*
near
they
perceived
that
the
trees
of
a
leafy
arcade
that
had
been
*NL*
constructed
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
were
filled
with
lights
*NL*
unaffected
by
the
wind
,
for
the
breeze
at
the
time
was
so
gentle
that
it
*NL*
had
not
power
to
stir
the
leaves
on
the
trees
.
The
musicians
were
the
*NL*
life
of
the
wedding
,
wandering
through
the
pleasant
grounds
in
separate
*NL*
bands
,
some
dancing
,
others
singing
,
others
playing
the
various
*NL*
instruments
already
mentioned
.
In
short
,
it
seemed
as
though
mirth
and
*NL*
gaiety
were
frisking
and
gambolling
all
over
the
meadow
.
Several
other
*NL*
persons
were
engaged
in
erecting
raised
benches
from
which
people
might
*NL*
conveniently
see
the
plays
and
dances
that
were
to
be
performed
the
next
*NL*
day
on
the
spot
dedicated
to
the
celebration
of
the
marriage
of
Camacho
*NL*
the
rich
and
the
obsequies
of
Basilio
.
Don
Quixote
would
not
enter
the
*NL*
village
,
although
the
peasant
as
well
as
the
bachelor
pressed
him
;
he
*NL*
excused
himself
,
however
,
on
the
grounds
,
amply
sufficient
in
his
*NL*
opinion
,
that
it
was
the
custom
of
knights-errant
to
sleep
in
the
fields
*NL*
and
woods
in
preference
to
towns
,
even
were
it
under
gilded
ceilings
;
and
*NL*
so
turned
aside
a
little
out
of
the
road
,
very
much
against
Sancho
's
*NL*
will
,
as
the
good
quarters
he
had
enjoyed
in
the
castle
or
house
of
Don
*NL*
Diego
came
back
to
his
mind
.

CHAPTER
XX
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
AN
ACCOUNT
IS
GIVEN
OF
THE
WEDDING
OF
CAMACHO
THE
RICH
,
TOGETHER
*NL*
WITH
THE
INCIDENT
OF
BASILIO
THE
POOR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Scarce
had
the
fair
Aurora
given
bright
Phoebus
time
to
dry
the
liquid
*NL*
pearls
upon
her
golden
locks
with
the
heat
of
his
fervent
rays
,
when
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
shaking
off
sloth
from
his
limbs
,
sprang
to
his
feet
and
called
*NL*
to
his
squire
Sancho
,
who
was
still
snoring
;
seeing
which
Don
Quixote
ere
*NL*
he
roused
him
thus
addressed
him
:
``
Happy
thou
,
above
all
the
dwellers
on
*NL*
the
face
of
the
earth
,
that
,
without
envying
or
being
envied
,
sleepest
*NL*
with
tranquil
mind
,
and
that
neither
enchanters
persecute
nor
*NL*
enchantments
affright
.
Sleep
,
I
say
,
and
will
say
a
hundred
times
,
*NL*
without
any
jealous
thoughts
of
thy
mistress
to
make
thee
keep
ceaseless
*NL*
vigils
,
or
any
cares
as
to
how
thou
art
to
pay
the
debts
thou
owest
,
or
*NL*
find
to-morrow
's
food
for
thyself
and
thy
needy
little
family
,
to
*NL*
interfere
with
thy
repose
.
Ambition
breaks
not
thy
rest
,
nor
doth
this
*NL*
world
's
empty
pomp
disturb
thee
,
for
the
utmost
reach
of
thy
anxiety
is
*NL*
to
provide
for
thy
ass
,
since
upon
my
shoulders
thou
hast
laid
the
*NL*
support
of
thyself
,
the
counterpoise
and
burden
that
nature
and
custom
*NL*
have
imposed
upon
masters
.
The
servant
sleeps
and
the
master
lies
awake
*NL*
thinking
how
he
is
to
feed
him
,
advance
him
,
and
reward
him
.
The
distress
*NL*
of
seeing
the
sky
turn
brazen
,
and
withhold
its
needful
moisture
from
the
*NL*
earth
,
is
not
felt
by
the
servant
but
by
the
master
,
who
in
time
of
*NL*
scarcity
and
famine
must
support
him
who
has
served
him
in
times
of
*NL*
plenty
and
abundance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
Sancho
made
no
reply
because
he
was
asleep
,
nor
would
he
have
*NL*
wakened
up
so
soon
as
he
did
had
not
Don
Quixote
brought
him
to
his
*NL*
senses
with
the
butt
of
his
lance
.
He
awoke
at
last
,
drowsy
and
lazy
,
and
*NL*
casting
his
eyes
about
in
every
direction
,
observed
,
``
There
comes
,
if
I
*NL*
do
n't
mistake
,
from
the
quarter
of
that
arcade
a
steam
and
a
smell
a
*NL*
great
deal
more
like
fried
rashers
than
galingale
or
thyme
;
a
wedding
*NL*
that
begins
with
smells
like
that
,
by
my
faith
,
ought
to
be
plentiful
and
*NL*
unstinting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
done
,
thou
glutton
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
come
,
let
us
go
and
witness
*NL*
this
bridal
,
and
see
what
the
rejected
Basilio
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
do
what
he
likes
,
''
returned
Sancho
;
``
be
he
not
poor
,
he
would
*NL*
marry
Quiteria
.
To
make
a
grand
match
for
himself
,
and
he
without
a
*NL*
farthing
;
is
there
nothing
else
?
Faith
,
senor
,
it
's
my
opinion
the
poor
*NL*
man
should
be
content
with
what
he
can
get
,
and
not
go
looking
for
*NL*
dainties
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
.
I
will
bet
my
arm
that
Camacho
could
*NL*
bury
Basilio
in
reals
;
and
if
that
be
so
,
as
no
doubt
it
is
,
what
a
fool
*NL*
Quiteria
would
be
to
refuse
the
fine
dresses
and
jewels
Camacho
must
have
*NL*
given
her
and
will
give
her
,
and
take
Basilio
's
bar-throwing
and
*NL*
sword-play
.
They
wo
n't
give
a
pint
of
wine
at
the
tavern
for
a
good
cast
*NL*
of
the
bar
or
a
neat
thrust
of
the
sword
.
Talents
and
accomplishments
*NL*
that
ca
n't
be
turned
into
money
,
let
Count
Dirlos
have
them
;
but
when
*NL*
such
gifts
fall
to
one
that
has
hard
cash
,
I
wish
my
condition
of
life
*NL*
was
as
becoming
as
they
are
.
On
a
good
foundation
you
can
raise
a
good
*NL*
building
,
and
the
best
foundation
in
the
world
is
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
God
's
sake
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
here
,
``
stop
that
harangue
;
it
*NL*
is
my
belief
,
if
thou
wert
allowed
to
continue
all
thou
beginnest
every
*NL*
instant
,
thou
wouldst
have
no
time
left
for
eating
or
sleeping
;
for
thou
*NL*
wouldst
spend
it
all
in
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
worship
had
a
good
memory
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
you
would
remember
*NL*
the
articles
of
our
agreement
before
we
started
from
home
this
last
time
;
*NL*
one
of
them
was
that
I
was
to
be
let
say
all
I
liked
,
so
long
as
it
was
*NL*
not
against
my
neighbour
or
your
worship
's
authority
;
and
so
far
,
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
,
I
have
not
broken
the
said
article
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
no
such
article
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
even
if
it
*NL*
were
so
,
I
desire
you
to
hold
your
tongue
and
come
along
;
for
the
*NL*
instruments
we
heard
last
night
are
already
beginning
to
enliven
the
*NL*
valleys
again
,
and
no
doubt
the
marriage
will
take
place
in
the
cool
of
*NL*
the
morning
,
and
not
in
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
did
as
his
master
bade
him
,
and
putting
the
saddle
on
Rocinante
*NL*
and
the
pack-saddle
on
Dapple
,
they
both
mounted
and
at
a
leisurely
pace
*NL*
entered
the
arcade
.
The
first
thing
that
presented
itself
to
Sancho
's
*NL*
eyes
was
a
whole
ox
spitted
on
a
whole
elm
tree
,
and
in
the
fire
at
which
*NL*
it
was
to
be
roasted
there
was
burning
a
middling-sized
mountain
of
*NL*
faggots
,
and
six
stewpots
that
stood
round
the
blaze
had
not
been
made
in
*NL*
the
ordinary
mould
of
common
pots
,
for
they
were
six
half
wine-jars
,
each
*NL*
fit
to
hold
the
contents
of
a
slaughter-house
;
they
swallowed
up
whole
*NL*
sheep
and
hid
them
away
in
their
insides
without
showing
any
more
sign
of
*NL*
them
than
if
they
were
pigeons
.
Countless
were
the
hares
ready
skinned
*NL*
and
the
plucked
fowls
that
hung
on
the
trees
for
burial
in
the
pots
,
*NL*
numberless
the
wildfowl
and
game
of
various
sorts
suspended
from
the
*NL*
branches
that
the
air
might
keep
them
cool
.
Sancho
counted
more
than
*NL*
sixty
wine
skins
of
over
six
gallons
each
,
and
all
filled
,
as
it
proved
*NL*
afterwards
,
with
generous
wines
.
There
were
,
besides
,
piles
of
the
*NL*
whitest
bread
,
like
the
heaps
of
corn
one
sees
on
the
threshing-floors
.
*NL*
There
was
a
wall
made
of
cheeses
arranged
like
open
brick-work
,
and
two
*NL*
cauldrons
full
of
oil
,
bigger
than
those
of
a
dyer
's
shop
,
served
for
*NL*
cooking
fritters
,
which
when
fried
were
taken
out
with
two
mighty
*NL*
shovels
,
and
plunged
into
another
cauldron
of
prepared
honey
that
stood
*NL*
close
by
.
Of
cooks
and
cook-maids
there
were
over
fifty
,
all
clean
,
*NL*
brisk
,
and
blithe
.
In
the
capacious
belly
of
the
ox
were
a
dozen
soft
*NL*
little
sucking-pigs
,
which
,
sewn
up
there
,
served
to
give
it
tenderness
*NL*
and
flavour
.
The
spices
of
different
kinds
did
not
seem
to
have
been
*NL*
bought
by
the
pound
but
by
the
quarter
,
and
all
lay
open
to
view
in
a
*NL*
great
chest
.
In
short
,
all
the
preparations
made
for
the
wedding
were
in
*NL*
rustic
style
,
but
abundant
enough
to
feed
an
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
observed
all
,
contemplated
all
,
and
everything
won
his
heart
.
The
*NL*
first
to
captivate
and
take
his
fancy
were
the
pots
,
out
of
which
he
*NL*
would
have
very
gladly
helped
himself
to
a
moderate
pipkinful
;
then
the
*NL*
wine
skins
secured
his
affections
;
and
lastly
,
the
produce
of
the
*NL*
frying-pans
,
if
,
indeed
,
such
imposing
cauldrons
may
be
called
*NL*
frying-pans
;
and
unable
to
control
himself
or
bear
it
any
longer
,
he
*NL*
approached
one
of
the
busy
cooks
and
civilly
but
hungrily
begged
*NL*
permission
to
soak
a
scrap
of
bread
in
one
of
the
pots
;
to
which
the
cook
*NL*
made
answer
,
``
Brother
,
this
is
not
a
day
on
which
hunger
is
to
have
any
*NL*
sway
,
thanks
to
the
rich
Camacho
;
get
down
and
look
about
for
a
ladle
and
*NL*
skim
off
a
hen
or
two
,
and
much
good
may
they
do
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
one
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
,
''
said
the
cook
;
``
sinner
that
I
am
!
how
particular
and
*NL*
bashful
you
are
!
''
and
so
saying
,
he
seized
a
bucket
and
plunging
it
into
*NL*
one
of
the
half
jars
took
up
three
hens
and
a
couple
of
geese
,
and
said
*NL*
to
Sancho
,
``
Fall
to
,
friend
,
and
take
the
edge
off
your
appetite
with
*NL*
these
skimmings
until
dinner-time
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nothing
to
put
them
in
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
the
cook
,
``
take
spoon
and
all
;
for
Camacho
's
wealth
and
*NL*
happiness
furnish
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Sancho
fared
thus
,
Don
Quixote
was
watching
the
entrance
,
at
one
*NL*
end
of
the
arcade
,
of
some
twelve
peasants
,
all
in
holiday
and
gala
*NL*
dress
,
mounted
on
twelve
beautiful
mares
with
rich
handsome
field
*NL*
trappings
and
a
number
of
little
bells
attached
to
their
petrals
,
who
,
*NL*
marshalled
in
regular
order
,
ran
not
one
but
several
courses
over
the
*NL*
meadow
,
with
jubilant
shouts
and
cries
of
``
Long
live
Camacho
and
*NL*
Quiteria
!
he
as
rich
as
she
is
fair
;
and
she
the
fairest
on
earth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
,
Don
Quixote
said
to
himself
,
``
It
is
easy
to
see
these
folk
*NL*
have
never
seen
my
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
;
for
if
they
had
they
would
be
*NL*
more
moderate
in
their
praises
of
this
Quiteria
of
theirs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
after
this
,
several
bands
of
dancers
of
various
sorts
began
to
*NL*
enter
the
arcade
at
different
points
,
and
among
them
one
of
sword-dancers
*NL*
composed
of
some
four-and-twenty
lads
of
gallant
and
high-spirited
mien
,
*NL*
clad
in
the
finest
and
whitest
of
linen
,
and
with
handkerchiefs
*NL*
embroidered
in
various
colours
with
fine
silk
;
and
one
of
those
on
the
*NL*
mares
asked
an
active
youth
who
led
them
if
any
of
the
dancers
had
been
*NL*
wounded
.
``
As
yet
,
thank
God
,
no
one
has
been
wounded
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
are
*NL*
all
safe
and
sound
;
''
and
he
at
once
began
to
execute
complicated
figures
*NL*
with
the
rest
of
his
comrades
,
with
so
many
turns
and
so
great
dexterity
,
*NL*
that
although
Don
Quixote
was
well
used
to
see
dances
of
the
same
kind
,
*NL*
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
any
so
good
as
this
.
He
also
admired
another
*NL*
that
came
in
composed
of
fair
young
maidens
,
none
of
whom
seemed
to
be
*NL*
under
fourteen
or
over
eighteen
years
of
age
,
all
clad
in
green
stuff
,
*NL*
with
their
locks
partly
braided
,
partly
flowing
loose
,
but
all
of
such
*NL*
bright
gold
as
to
vie
with
the
sunbeams
,
and
over
them
they
wore
garlands
*NL*
of
jessamine
,
roses
,
amaranth
,
and
honeysuckle
.
At
their
head
were
a
*NL*
venerable
old
man
and
an
ancient
dame
,
more
brisk
and
active
,
however
,
*NL*
than
might
have
been
expected
from
their
years
.
The
notes
of
a
Zamora
*NL*
bagpipe
accompanied
them
,
and
with
modesty
in
their
countenances
and
in
*NL*
their
eyes
,
and
lightness
in
their
feet
,
they
looked
the
best
dancers
in
*NL*
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Following
these
there
came
an
artistic
dance
of
the
sort
they
call
*NL*
``
speaking
dances
.
''
It
was
composed
of
eight
nymphs
in
two
files
,
with
the
*NL*
god
Cupid
leading
one
and
Interest
the
other
,
the
former
furnished
with
*NL*
wings
,
bow
,
quiver
and
arrows
,
the
latter
in
a
rich
dress
of
gold
and
*NL*
silk
of
divers
colours
.
The
nymphs
that
followed
Love
bore
their
names
*NL*
written
on
white
parchment
in
large
letters
on
their
backs
.
``
Poetry
''
was
*NL*
the
name
of
the
first
,
``
Wit
''
of
the
second
,
``
Birth
''
of
the
third
,
and
*NL*
``
Valour
''
of
the
fourth
.
Those
that
followed
Interest
were
distinguished
*NL*
in
the
same
way
;
the
badge
of
the
first
announced
``
Liberality
,
''
that
of
*NL*
the
second
``
Largess
,
''
the
third
``
Treasure
,
''
and
the
fourth
``
Peaceful
*NL*
Possession
.
''
In
front
of
them
all
came
a
wooden
castle
drawn
by
four
wild
*NL*
men
,
all
clad
in
ivy
and
hemp
stained
green
,
and
looking
so
natural
that
*NL*
they
nearly
terrified
Sancho
.
On
the
front
of
the
castle
and
on
each
of
*NL*
the
four
sides
of
its
frame
it
bore
the
inscription
``
Castle
of
Caution
.
''
*NL*
Four
skillful
tabor
and
flute
players
accompanied
them
,
and
the
dance
*NL*
having
been
opened
,
Cupid
,
after
executing
two
figures
,
raised
his
eyes
*NL*
and
bent
his
bow
against
a
damsel
who
stood
between
the
turrets
of
the
*NL*
castle
,
and
thus
addressed
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
the
mighty
God
whose
sway
*NL*
Is
potent
over
land
and
sea
.
*NL*
The
heavens
above
us
own
me
;
nay
,
*NL*
The
shades
below
acknowledge
me
.
*NL*
I
know
not
fear
,
I
have
my
will
,
*NL*
Whate'er
my
whim
or
fancy
be
;
*NL*
For
me
there
's
no
impossible
,
*NL*
I
order
,
bind
,
forbid
,
set
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
concluded
the
stanza
he
discharged
an
arrow
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
castle
,
and
went
back
to
his
place
.
Interest
then
came
forward
and
went
*NL*
through
two
more
figures
,
and
as
soon
as
the
tabors
ceased
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
But
mightier
than
Love
am
I
,
*NL*
Though
Love
it
be
that
leads
me
on
,
*NL*
Than
mine
no
lineage
is
more
high
,
*NL*
Or
older
,
underneath
the
sun
.
*NL*
To
use
me
rightly
few
know
how
,
*NL*
To
act
without
me
fewer
still
,
*NL*
For
I
am
Interest
,
and
I
vow
*NL*
For
evermore
to
do
thy
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Interest
retired
,
and
Poetry
came
forward
,
and
when
she
had
gone
through
*NL*
her
figures
like
the
others
,
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
damsel
of
the
castle
,
*NL*
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
With
many
a
fanciful
conceit
,
*NL*
Fair
Lady
,
winsome
Poesy
*NL*
Her
soul
,
an
offering
at
thy
feet
,
*NL*
Presents
in
sonnets
unto
thee
.
*NL*
If
thou
my
homage
wilt
not
scorn
,
*NL*
Thy
fortune
,
watched
by
envious
eyes
,
*NL*
On
wings
of
poesy
upborne
*NL*
Shall
be
exalted
to
the
skies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poetry
withdrew
,
and
on
the
side
of
Interest
Liberality
advanced
,
and
*NL*
after
having
gone
through
her
figures
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
To
give
,
while
shunning
each
extreme
,
*NL*
The
sparing
hand
,
the
over-free
,
*NL*
Therein
consists
,
so
wise
men
deem
,
*NL*
The
virtue
Liberality
.
*NL*
But
thee
,
fair
lady
,
to
enrich
,
*NL*
Myself
a
prodigal
I
'll
prove
,
*NL*
A
vice
not
wholly
shameful
,
which
*NL*
May
find
its
fair
excuse
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
manner
all
the
characters
of
the
two
bands
advanced
and
*NL*
retired
,
and
each
executed
its
figures
,
and
delivered
its
verses
,
some
of
*NL*
them
graceful
,
some
burlesque
,
but
Don
Quixote
's
memory
-LRB-
though
he
had
an
*NL*
excellent
one
-RRB-
only
carried
away
those
that
have
been
just
quoted
.
All
*NL*
then
mingled
together
,
forming
chains
and
breaking
off
again
with
*NL*
graceful
,
unconstrained
gaiety
;
and
whenever
Love
passed
in
front
of
the
*NL*
castle
he
shot
his
arrows
up
at
it
,
while
Interest
broke
gilded
pellets
*NL*
against
it
.
At
length
,
after
they
had
danced
a
good
while
,
Interest
drew
*NL*
out
a
great
purse
,
made
of
the
skin
of
a
large
brindled
cat
and
to
all
*NL*
appearance
full
of
money
,
and
flung
it
at
the
castle
,
and
with
the
force
*NL*
of
the
blow
the
boards
fell
asunder
and
tumbled
down
,
leaving
the
damsel
*NL*
exposed
and
unprotected
.
Interest
and
the
characters
of
his
band
*NL*
advanced
,
and
throwing
a
great
chain
of
gold
over
her
neck
pretended
to
*NL*
take
her
and
lead
her
away
captive
,
on
seeing
which
,
Love
and
his
*NL*
supporters
made
as
though
they
would
release
her
,
the
whole
action
being
*NL*
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
tabors
and
in
the
form
of
a
regular
dance
.
*NL*
The
wild
men
made
peace
between
them
,
and
with
great
dexterity
readjusted
*NL*
and
fixed
the
boards
of
the
castle
,
and
the
damsel
once
more
ensconced
*NL*
herself
within
;
and
with
this
the
dance
wound
up
,
to
the
great
enjoyment
*NL*
of
the
beholders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
asked
one
of
the
nymphs
who
it
was
that
had
composed
and
*NL*
arranged
it
.
She
replied
that
it
was
a
beneficiary
of
the
town
who
had
a
*NL*
nice
taste
in
devising
things
of
the
sort
.
``
I
will
lay
a
wager
,
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
that
the
same
bachelor
or
beneficiary
is
a
greater
friend
of
*NL*
Camacho
's
than
of
Basilio
's
,
and
that
he
is
better
at
satire
than
at
*NL*
vespers
;
he
has
introduced
the
accomplishments
of
Basilio
and
the
riches
*NL*
of
Camacho
very
neatly
into
the
dance
.
''
Sancho
Panza
,
who
was
listening
*NL*
to
all
this
,
exclaimed
,
``
The
king
is
my
cock
;
I
stick
to
Camacho
.
''
``
It
is
*NL*
easy
to
see
thou
art
a
clown
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
one
of
that
*NL*
sort
that
cry
`
Long
life
to
the
conqueror
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
of
what
sort
I
am
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
but
I
know
very
well
*NL*
I
'll
never
get
such
elegant
skimmings
off
Basilio
's
pots
as
these
I
have
*NL*
got
off
Camacho
's
;
''
and
he
showed
him
the
bucketful
of
geese
and
hens
,
*NL*
and
seizing
one
began
to
eat
with
great
gaiety
and
appetite
,
saying
,
``
A
*NL*
fig
for
the
accomplishments
of
Basilio
!
As
much
as
thou
hast
so
much
art
*NL*
thou
worth
,
and
as
much
as
thou
art
worth
so
much
hast
thou
.
As
a
*NL*
grandmother
of
mine
used
to
say
,
there
are
only
two
families
in
the
*NL*
world
,
the
Haves
and
the
Have
n'ts
;
and
she
stuck
to
the
Haves
;
and
to
*NL*
this
day
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
people
would
sooner
feel
the
pulse
of
*NL*
`
Have
,
'
than
of
`
Know
;
'
an
ass
covered
with
gold
looks
better
than
a
*NL*
horse
with
a
pack-saddle
.
So
once
more
I
say
I
stick
to
Camacho
,
the
*NL*
bountiful
skimmings
of
whose
pots
are
geese
and
hens
,
hares
and
rabbits
;
*NL*
but
of
Basilio
's
,
if
any
ever
come
to
hand
,
or
even
to
foot
,
they
'll
be
*NL*
only
rinsings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hast
thou
finished
thy
harangue
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
``
Of
course
I
*NL*
have
finished
it
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
because
I
see
your
worship
takes
*NL*
offence
at
it
;
but
if
it
was
not
for
that
,
there
was
work
enough
cut
out
*NL*
for
three
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
I
may
see
thee
dumb
before
I
die
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
rate
we
are
going
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
'll
be
chewing
clay
before
*NL*
your
worship
dies
;
and
then
,
maybe
,
I
'll
be
so
dumb
that
I
'll
not
say
a
*NL*
word
until
the
end
of
the
world
,
or
,
at
least
,
till
the
day
of
judgment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
should
that
happen
,
O
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
thy
silence
will
*NL*
never
come
up
to
all
thou
hast
talked
,
art
talking
,
and
wilt
talk
all
thy
*NL*
life
;
moreover
,
it
naturally
stands
to
reason
,
that
my
death
will
come
*NL*
before
thine
;
so
I
never
expect
to
see
thee
dumb
,
not
even
when
thou
art
*NL*
drinking
or
sleeping
,
and
that
is
the
utmost
I
can
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
good
faith
,
senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
there
's
no
trusting
that
*NL*
fleshless
one
,
I
mean
Death
,
who
devours
the
lamb
as
soon
as
the
sheep
,
*NL*
and
,
as
I
have
heard
our
curate
say
,
treads
with
equal
foot
upon
the
*NL*
lofty
towers
of
kings
and
the
lowly
huts
of
the
poor
.
That
lady
is
more
*NL*
mighty
than
dainty
,
she
is
in
no
way
squeamish
,
she
devours
all
and
is
ready
*NL*
for
all
,
and
fills
her
alforjas
with
people
of
all
sorts
,
ages
,
and
*NL*
ranks
.
She
is
no
reaper
that
sleeps
out
the
noontide
;
at
all
times
she
is
*NL*
reaping
and
cutting
down
,
as
well
the
dry
grass
as
the
green
;
she
never
*NL*
seems
to
chew
,
but
bolts
and
swallows
all
that
is
put
before
her
,
for
she
*NL*
has
a
canine
appetite
that
is
never
satisfied
;
and
though
she
has
no
*NL*
belly
,
she
shows
she
has
a
dropsy
and
is
athirst
to
drink
the
lives
of
*NL*
all
that
live
,
as
one
would
drink
a
jug
of
cold
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no
more

Sancho

said
Don
Quixote
at
this
;
``
do
n't
try
to
better
it

*NL*
and
risk
a
fall
;
for
in
truth
what
thou
hast
said
about
death
in
thy
*NL*
rustic
phrase
is
what
a
good
preacher
might
have
said
.
I
tell
thee
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
if
thou
hadst
discretion
equal
to
thy
mother
wit
,
thou
mightst
*NL*
take
a
pulpit
in
hand
,

go
about
the
world
preaching
fine
sermons

''
*NL*
``
He
preaches
well

Sancho

I
know
no
more

theology

that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
needst
thou

said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
I
can
not
conceive

make
out

how
it
is
that

the
fear

of
wisdom

more
afraid

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pass
judgment
on
your
chivalries

returned
Sancho
,
``

do
n't
*NL*
set
yourself
up
to
judge
of

fears

am
as

good
a
fearer
of
God

leave
me
to
despatch
these

skimmings

for
all

only
idle
talk

so
saying

he
began
a
fresh
attack
*NL*
on
the
bucket

with
such
a
hearty
appetite
that
he
aroused
Don

,

who
no

CHAPTER
XXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
CAMACHO
'S
WEDDING
IS
CONTINUED
,
WITH
OTHER
DELIGHTFUL
INCIDENTS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
were
engaged
in
the
discussion
set
forth
the
*NL*
last
chapter
,
they
heard
loud
shouts
and
a
great
noise
,
which
were
*NL*
uttered
and
made
by
the
men
on
the
mares
as
they
went
at
full
gallop
,
*NL*
shouting
,
to
receive
the
bride
and
bridegroom
,
who
were
approaching
with
*NL*
musical
instruments
and
pageantry
of
all
sorts
around
them
,
and
*NL*
accompanied
by
the
priest
and
the
relatives
of
both
,
and
all
the
most
*NL*
distinguished
people
of
the
surrounding
villages
.
When
Sancho
saw
the
*NL*
bride
,
he
exclaimed
,
``
By
my
faith
,
she
is
not
dressed
like
a
country
*NL*
girl
,
but
like
some
fine
court
lady
;
egad
,
as
well
as
I
can
make
out
,
the
*NL*
patena
she
wears
rich
coral
,
and
her
green
Cuenca
stuff
is
thirty-pile
*NL*
velvet
;
and
then
the
white
linen
trimming
--
by
my
oath
,
but
it
's
satin
!
*NL*
Look
at
her
hands
--
jet
rings
on
them
!
May
I
never
have
luck
if
they
're
*NL*
not
gold
rings
,
and
real
gold
,
and
set
with
pearls
as
white
as
a
curdled
*NL*
milk
,
and
every
one
of
them
worth
an
eye
of
one
's
head
!
Whoreson
baggage
,
*NL*
what
hair
she
has
!
if
it
's
not
a
wig
,
I
never
saw
longer
or
fairer
all
*NL*
the
days
of
my
life
.
See
how
bravely
she
bears
herself
--
and
her
shape
!
*NL*
Would
n't
you
say
she
was
like
a
walking
palm
tree
loaded
with
clusters
of
*NL*
dates
?
for
the
trinkets
she
has
hanging
from
her
hair
and
neck
look
just
*NL*
like
them
.
I
swear
in
my
heart
she
is
a
brave
lass
,
and
fit
`
to
pass
over
*NL*
the
banks
of
Flanders
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
laughed
at
Sancho
's
boorish
eulogies
and
thought
that
,
saving
*NL*
his
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
he
had
never
seen
a
more
beautiful
woman
.
*NL*
The
fair
Quiteria
appeared
somewhat
pale
,
which
was
,
no
doubt
,
because
of
*NL*
the
bad
night
brides
always
pass
dressing
themselves
out
for
their
*NL*
wedding
on
the
morrow
.
They
advanced
towards
a
theatre
that
stood
on
one
*NL*
side
of
the
meadow
decked
with
carpets
and
boughs
,
where
they
were
to
*NL*
plight
their
troth
,
and
from
which
they
were
to
behold
the
dances
and
*NL*
plays
;
but
at
the
moment
of
their
arrival
at
the
spot
they
heard
a
loud
*NL*
outcry
behind
them
,
and
a
voice
exclaiming
,
``
Wait
a
little
,
ye
,
as
*NL*
inconsiderate
as
ye
are
hasty
!
''
At
these
words
all
turned
round
,
and
*NL*
perceived
that
the
speaker
was
a
man
clad
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
loose
*NL*
black
coat
garnished
with
crimson
patches
like
flames
.
He
was
crowned
-LRB-
as
*NL*
was
presently
seen
-RRB-
with
a
crown
of
gloomy
cypress
,
and
in
his
hand
he
*NL*
held
a
long
staff
.
As
he
approached
he
was
recognised
by
everyone
as
the
*NL*
gay
Basilio
,
and
all
waited
anxiously
to
see
what
would
come
of
his
*NL*
words
,
in
dread
of
some
catastrophe
in
consequence
of
his
appearance
at
*NL*
such
a
moment
.
He
came
up
at
last
weary
and
breathless
,
and
planting
*NL*
himself
in
front
of
the
bridal
pair
,
drove
his
staff
,
which
had
a
steel
*NL*
spike
at
the
end
,
into
the
ground
,
and
,
with
a
pale
face
and
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
Quiteria
,
he
thus
addressed
her
in
a
hoarse
,
trembling
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
dost
thou
know
,
ungrateful
Quiteria
,
that
according
to
the
holy
law
*NL*
we
acknowledge
,
so
long
as
live
thou
canst
take
no
husband
;
nor
art
thou
*NL*
ignorant
either
that
,
in
my
hopes
that
time
and
my
own
exertions
would
*NL*
improve
my
fortunes
,
I
have
never
failed
to
observe
the
respect
due
to
*NL*
thy
honour
;
but
thou
,
casting
behind
thee
all
thou
owest
to
my
true
love
,
*NL*
wouldst
surrender
what
is
mine
to
another
whose
wealth
serves
to
bring
*NL*
him
not
only
good
fortune
but
supreme
happiness
;
and
now
to
complete
it
*NL*
-LRB-
not
that
I
think
he
deserves
it
,
but
inasmuch
as
heaven
is
pleased
to
*NL*
bestow
it
upon
him
-RRB-
,
I
will
,
with
my
own
hands
,
do
away
with
the
obstacle
*NL*
that
may
interfere
with
it
,
and
remove
myself
from
between
you
.
Long
live
*NL*
the
rich
Camacho
!
many
a
happy
year
may
he
live
with
the
ungrateful
*NL*
Quiteria
!
and
let
the
poor
Basilio
die
,
Basilio
whose
poverty
clipped
the
*NL*
wings
of
his
happiness
,
and
brought
him
to
the
grave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
saying
,
he
seized
the
staff
he
had
driven
into
the
ground
,
and
*NL*
leaving
one
half
of
it
fixed
there
,
showed
it
to
be
a
sheath
that
*NL*
concealed
a
tolerably
long
rapier
;
and
,
what
may
be
called
its
hilt
being
*NL*
planted
in
the
ground
,
he
swiftly
,
coolly
,
and
deliberately
threw
himself
*NL*
upon
it
,
and
in
an
instant
the
bloody
point
and
half
the
steel
blade
*NL*
appeared
at
his
back
,
the
unhappy
man
falling
to
the
earth
bathed
in
his
*NL*
blood
,
and
transfixed
by
his
own
weapon
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friends
at
once
ran
to
his
aid
,
filled
with
grief
at
his
misery
and
*NL*
sad
fate
,
and
Don
Quixote
,
dismounting
from
Rocinante
,
hastened
to
*NL*
support
him
,
and
took
him
in
his
arms
,
and
found
he
had
not
yet
ceased
to
*NL*
breathe
.
They
were
about
to
draw
out
the
rapier
,
but
the
priest
who
was
*NL*
standing
by
objected
to
its
being
withdrawn
before
he
had
confessed
him
,
*NL*
as
the
instant
of
its
withdrawal
would
be
that
of
this
death
.
Basilio
,
*NL*
however
,
reviving
slightly
,
said
in
a
weak
voice
,
as
though
in
pain
,
``
If
*NL*
thou
wouldst
consent
,
cruel
Quiteria
,
to
give
me
thy
hand
as
my
bride
in
*NL*
this
last
fatal
moment
,
I
might
still
hope
that
my
rashness
would
find
*NL*
pardon
,
as
by
its
means
I
attained
the
bliss
of
being
thine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
the
priest
bade
him
think
of
the
welfare
of
his
soul
rather
*NL*
than
of
the
cravings
of
the
body
,
and
in
all
earnestness
implore
God
's
*NL*
pardon
for
his
sins
and
for
his
rash
resolve
;
to
which
Basilio
replied
*NL*
that
he
was
determined
not
to
confess
unless
Quiteria
first
gave
him
her
*NL*
hand
in
marriage
,
for
that
happiness
would
compose
his
mind
and
give
him
*NL*
courage
to
make
his
confession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
hearing
the
wounded
man
's
entreaty
,
exclaimed
aloud
that
what
*NL*
Basilio
asked
was
just
and
reasonable
,
and
moreover
a
request
that
might
*NL*
be
easily
complied
with
;
and
that
it
would
be
as
much
to
Senor
Camacho
's
*NL*
honour
to
receive
the
lady
Quiteria
as
the
widow
of
the
brave
Basilio
as
*NL*
if
he
received
her
direct
from
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
case
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
will
be
only
to
say
`
yes
,
'
and
no
*NL*
consequences
can
follow
the
utterance
of
the
word
,
for
the
nuptial
couch
*NL*
of
this
marriage
must
be
the
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Camacho
was
listening
to
all
this
,
perplexed
and
bewildered
and
not
*NL*
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
;
but
so
urgent
were
the
entreaties
of
Basilio
's
*NL*
friends
,
imploring
him
to
allow
Quiteria
to
give
him
her
hand
,
so
that
*NL*
his
soul
,
quitting
this
life
in
despair
,
should
not
be
lost
,
that
they
*NL*
moved
,
nay
,
forced
him
,
to
say
that
if
Quiteria
were
willing
to
give
it
*NL*
he
was
satisfied
,
as
it
was
only
putting
off
the
fulfillment
of
his
*NL*
wishes
for
a
moment
.
At
once
all
assailed
Quiteria
and
pressed
her
,
some
*NL*
with
prayers
,
and
others
with
tears
,
and
others
with
persuasive
*NL*
arguments
,
to
give
her
hand
to
poor
Basilio
;
but
she
,
harder
than
marble
*NL*
and
more
unmoved
than
any
statue
,
seemed
unable
or
unwilling
to
utter
a
*NL*
word
,
nor
would
she
have
given
any
reply
had
not
the
priest
bade
her
*NL*
decide
quickly
what
she
meant
to
do
,
as
Basilio
now
had
his
soul
at
his
*NL*
teeth
,
and
there
was
no
time
for
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
the
fair
Quiteria
,
to
all
appearance
distressed
,
grieved
,
and
*NL*
repentant
,
advanced
without
a
word
to
where
Basilio
lay
,
his
eyes
already
*NL*
turned
in
his
head
,
his
breathing
short
and
painful
,
murmuring
the
name
*NL*
of
Quiteria
between
his
teeth
,
and
apparently
about
to
die
like
a
heathen
*NL*
and
not
like
a
Christian
.
Quiteria
approached
him
,
and
kneeling
,
demanded
*NL*
his
hand
by
signs
without
speaking
.
Basilio
opened
his
eyes
and
gazing
*NL*
fixedly
at
her
,
said
,
``
O
Quiteria
,
why
hast
thou
turned
compassionate
at
*NL*
a
moment
when
thy
compassion
will
serve
as
a
dagger
to
rob
me
of
life
,
*NL*
for
I
have
not
now
the
strength
left
either
to
bear
the
happiness
thou
*NL*
givest
me
in
accepting
me
as
thine
,
or
to
suppress
the
pain
that
is
*NL*
rapidly
drawing
the
dread
shadow
of
death
over
my
eyes
?
What
I
entreat
of
*NL*
thee
,
O
thou
fatal
star
to
me
,
is
that
the
hand
thou
demandest
of
me
and
*NL*
wouldst
give
me
,
be
not
given
out
of
complaisance
or
to
deceive
me
*NL*
afresh
,
but
that
thou
confess
and
declare
that
without
any
constraint
*NL*
upon
thy
will
thou
givest
it
to
me
as
to
thy
lawful
husband
;
for
it
is
*NL*
not
meet
that
thou
shouldst
trifle
with
me
at
such
a
moment
as
this
,
or
*NL*
have
recourse
to
falsehoods
with
one
who
has
dealt
so
truly
by
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
uttering
these
words
he
showed
such
weakness
that
the
bystanders
*NL*
expected
each
return
of
faintness
would
take
his
life
with
it
.
Then
*NL*
Quiteria
,
overcome
with
modesty
and
shame
,
holding
in
her
right
hand
the
*NL*
hand
of
Basilio
,
said
,
``
No
force
would
bend
my
will
;
as
freely
,
*NL*
therefore
,
as
it
is
possible
for
me
to
do
so
,
I
give
thee
the
hand
of
a
*NL*
lawful
wife
,
and
take
thine
if
thou
givest
it
to
me
of
thine
own
free
*NL*
will
,
untroubled
and
unaffected
by
the
calamity
thy
hasty
act
has
brought
*NL*
upon
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
give
it
,
''
said
Basilio
,
``
not
agitated
or
distracted
,
but
with
*NL*
unclouded
reason
that
heaven
is
pleased
to
grant
me
,
thus
do
I
give
*NL*
myself
to
be
thy
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
give
myself
to
be
thy
wife
,
''
said
Quiteria
,
``
whether
thou
livest
*NL*
many
years
,
or
they
carry
thee
from
my
arms
to
the
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
one
so
badly
wounded
,
''
observed
Sancho
at
this
point
,
``
this
young
*NL*
man
has
a
great
deal
to
say
;
they
should
make
him
leave
off
billing
and
*NL*
cooing
,
and
attend
to
his
soul
;
for
to
my
thinking
he
has
it
more
on
his
*NL*
tongue
than
at
his
teeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Basilio
and
Quiteria
having
thus
joined
hands
,
the
priest
,
deeply
moved
*NL*
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
pronounced
the
blessing
upon
them
,
and
*NL*
implored
heaven
to
grant
an
easy
passage
to
the
soul
of
the
newly
wedded
*NL*
man
,
who
,
the
instant
he
received
the
blessing
,
started
nimbly
to
his
*NL*
feet
and
with
unparalleled
effrontery
pulled
out
the
rapier
that
had
been
*NL*
sheathed
in
his
body
.
All
the
bystanders
were
astounded
,
and
some
,
more
*NL*
simple
than
inquiring
,
began
shouting
,
``
A
miracle
,
a
miracle
!
''
But
*NL*
Basilio
replied
,
``
No
miracle
,
no
miracle
;
only
a
trick
,
a
trick
!
''
The
*NL*
priest
,
perplexed
and
amazed
,
made
haste
to
examine
the
wound
with
both
*NL*
hands
,
and
found
that
the
blade
had
passed
,
not
through
Basilio
's
flesh
*NL*
and
ribs
,
but
through
a
hollow
iron
tube
full
of
blood
,
which
he
had
*NL*
adroitly
fixed
at
the
place
,
the
blood
,
as
was
afterwards
ascertained
,
*NL*
having
been
so
prepared
as
not
to
congeal
.
In
short
,
the
priest
and
*NL*
Camacho
and
most
of
those
present
saw
they
were
tricked
and
made
fools
*NL*
of
.
The
bride
showed
no
signs
of
displeasure
at
the
deception
;
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
hearing
them
say
that
the
marriage
,
being
fraudulent
,
would
not
*NL*
be
valid
,
she
said
that
she
confirmed
it
afresh
,
whence
they
all
*NL*
concluded
that
the
affair
had
been
planned
by
agreement
and
understanding
*NL*
between
the
pair
,
whereat
Camacho
and
his
supporters
were
so
mortified
*NL*
that
they
proceeded
to
revenge
themselves
by
violence
,
and
a
great
number
*NL*
of
them
drawing
their
swords
attacked
Basilio
,
in
whose
protection
as
*NL*
many
more
swords
were
in
an
instant
unsheathed
,
while
Don
Quixote
taking
*NL*
the
lead
on
horseback
,
with
his
lance
over
his
arm
and
well
covered
with
*NL*
his
shield
,
made
all
give
way
before
him
.
Sancho
,
who
never
found
any
*NL*
pleasure
or
enjoyment
in
such
doings
,
retreated
to
the
wine-jars
from
*NL*
which
he
had
taken
his
delectable
skimmings
,
considering
that
,
as
a
holy
*NL*
place
,
that
spot
would
be
respected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
sirs
,
hold
!
''
cried
Don
Quixote
in
a
loud
voice
;
``
we
have
no
right
*NL*
to
take
vengeance
for
wrongs
that
love
may
do
to
us
:
remember
love
and
*NL*
war
are
the
same
thing
,
and
as
in
war
it
is
allowable
and
common
to
make
*NL*
use
of
wiles
and
stratagems
to
overcome
the
enemy
,
so
in
the
contests
and
*NL*
rivalries
of
love
the
tricks
and
devices
employed
to
attain
the
desired
*NL*
end
are
justifiable
,
provided
they
be
not
to
the
discredit
or
dishonour
*NL*
of
the
loved
object
.
Quiteria
belonged
to
Basilio
and
Basilio
to
Quiteria
*NL*
by
the
just
and
beneficent
disposal
of
heaven
.
Camacho
is
rich
,
and
can
*NL*
purchase
his
pleasure
when
,
where
,
and
as
it
pleases
him
.
Basilio
has
but
*NL*
this
ewe-lamb
,
and
no
one
,
however
powerful
he
may
be
,
shall
take
her
*NL*
from
him
;
these
two
whom
God
hath
joined
man
can
not
separate
;
and
he
who
*NL*
attempts
it
must
first
pass
the
point
of
this
lance
;
''
and
so
saying
he
*NL*
brandished
it
so
stoutly
and
dexterously
that
he
overawed
all
who
did
not
*NL*
know
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
so
deep
an
impression
had
the
rejection
of
Quiteria
made
on
Camacho
's
*NL*
mind
that
it
banished
her
at
once
from
his
thoughts
;
and
so
the
counsels
*NL*
of
the
priest
,
who
was
a
wise
and
kindly
disposed
man
,
prevailed
with
*NL*
him
,
and
by
their
means
he
and
his
partisans
were
pacified
and
*NL*
tranquillised
,
and
to
prove
it
put
up
their
swords
again
,
inveighing
*NL*
against
the
pliancy
of
Quiteria
rather
than
the
craftiness
of
Basilio
;
*NL*
Camacho
maintaining
that
,
if
Quiteria
as
a
maiden
had
such
a
love
for
*NL*
Basilio
,
she
would
have
loved
him
too
as
a
married
woman
,
and
that
he
*NL*
ought
to
thank
heaven
more
for
having
taken
her
than
for
having
given
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Camacho
and
those
of
his
following
,
therefore
,
being
consoled
and
*NL*
pacified
,
those
on
Basilio
's
side
were
appeased
;
and
the
rich
Camacho
,
to
*NL*
show
that
he
felt
no
resentment
for
the
trick
,
and
did
not
care
about
it
,
*NL*
desired
the
festival
to
go
on
just
as
if
he
were
married
in
reality
.
*NL*
Neither
Basilio
,
however
,
nor
his
bride
,
nor
their
followers
would
take
*NL*
any
part
in
it
,
and
they
withdrew
to
Basilio
's
village
;
for
the
poor
,
if
*NL*
they
are
persons
of
virtue
and
good
sense
,
have
those
who
follow
,
honour
,
*NL*
and
uphold
them
,
just
as
the
rich
have
those
who
flatter
and
dance
*NL*
attendance
on
them
.
With
them
they
carried
Don
Quixote
,
regarding
him
as
*NL*
a
man
of
worth
and
a
stout
one
.
Sancho
alone
had
a
cloud
on
his
soul
,
for
*NL*
he
found
himself
debarred
from
waiting
for
Camacho
's
splendid
feast
and
*NL*
festival
,
which
lasted
until
night
;
and
thus
dragged
away
,
he
moodily
*NL*
followed
his
master
,
who
accompanied
Basilio
's
party
,
and
left
behind
him
*NL*
the
flesh-pots
of
Egypt
;
though
in
his
heart
he
took
them
with
him
,
and
*NL*
their
now
nearly
finished
skimmings
that
he
carried
in
the
bucket
*NL*
conjured
up
visions
before
his
eyes
of
the
glory
and
abundance
of
the
*NL*
good
cheer
he
was
losing
.
And
so
,
vexed
and
dejected
though
not
hungry
,
*NL*

from

CHAPTER
XXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHERIN
IS
RELATED
THE
GRAND
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
CAVE
OF
MONTESINOS
IN
THE
*NL*
HEART
OF
LA
MANCHA
,
WHICH
THE
VALIANT
DON
QUIXOTE
BROUGHT
TO
A
HAPPY
*NL*
TERMINATION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Many
and
great
were
the
attentions
shown
to
Don
Quixote
by
the
newly
*NL*
married
couple
,
who
felt
themselves
under
an
obligation
to
him
for
coming
*NL*
forward
in
defence
of
their
cause
;
and
they
exalted
his
wisdom
to
the
*NL*
same
level
with
his
courage
,
rating
him
as
a
Cid
in
arms
,
and
a
Cicero
in
*NL*
eloquence
.
Worthy
Sancho
enjoyed
himself
for
three
days
at
the
expense
of
*NL*
the
pair
,
from
whom
they
learned
that
the
sham
wound
was
not
a
scheme
*NL*
arranged
with
the
fair
Quiteria
,
but
a
device
of
Basilio
's
,
who
counted
*NL*
on
exactly
the
result
they
had
seen
;
he
confessed
,
it
is
true
,
that
he
*NL*
had
confided
his
idea
to
some
of
his
friends
,
so
that
at
the
proper
time
*NL*
they
might
aid
him
in
his
purpose
and
insure
the
success
of
the
*NL*
deception
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
is
not
and
ought
not
to
be
called
deception
*NL*
which
aims
at
virtuous
ends
;
''
and
the
marriage
of
lovers
he
maintained
to
*NL*
be
a
most
excellent
end
,
reminding
them
,
however
,
that
love
has
no
*NL*
greater
enemy
than
hunger
and
constant
want
;
for
love
is
all
gaiety
,
*NL*
enjoyment
,
and
happiness
,
especially
when
the
lover
is
in
the
possession
*NL*
of
the
object
of
his
love
,
and
poverty
and
want
are
the
declared
enemies
*NL*
of
all
these
;
which
he
said
to
urge
Senor
Basilio
to
abandon
the
practice
*NL*
of
those
accomplishments
he
was
skilled
in
,
for
though
they
brought
him
*NL*
fame
,
they
brought
him
no
money
,
and
apply
himself
to
the
acquisition
of
*NL*
wealth
by
legitimate
industry
,
which
will
never
fail
those
who
are
*NL*
prudent
and
persevering
.
The
poor
man
who
is
a
man
of
honour
-LRB-
if
indeed
a
*NL*
poor
man
can
be
a
man
of
honour
-RRB-
has
a
jewel
when
he
has
a
fair
wife
,
and
*NL*
if
she
is
taken
from
him
,
his
honour
is
taken
from
him
and
slain
.
The
*NL*
fair
woman
who
is
a
woman
of
honour
,
and
whose
husband
is
poor
,
deserves
*NL*
to
be
crowned
with
the
laurels
and
crowns
of
victory
and
triumph
.
Beauty
*NL*
by
itself
attracts
the
desires
of
all
who
behold
it
,
and
the
royal
eagles
*NL*
and
birds
of
towering
flight
stoop
on
it
as
on
a
dainty
lure
;
but
if
*NL*
beauty
be
accompanied
by
want
and
penury
,
then
the
ravens
and
the
kites
*NL*
and
other
birds
of
prey
assail
it
,
and
she
who
stands
firm
against
such
*NL*
attacks
well
deserves
to
be
called
the
crown
of
her
husband
.
``
Remember
,
O
*NL*
prudent
Basilio
,
''
added
Don
Quixote
,
``
it
was
the
opinion
of
a
certain
*NL*
sage
,
I
know
not
whom
,
that
there
was
not
more
than
one
good
woman
in
the
*NL*
whole
world
;
and
his
advice
was
that
each
one
should
think
and
believe
*NL*
that
this
one
good
woman
was
his
own
wife
,
and
in
this
way
he
would
live
*NL*
happy
.
I
myself
am
not
married
,
nor
,
so
far
,
has
it
ever
entered
my
*NL*
thoughts
to
be
so
;
nevertheless
I
would
venture
to
give
advice
to
anyone
*NL*
who
might
ask
it
,
as
to
the
mode
in
which
he
should
seek
a
wife
such
as
*NL*
he
would
be
content
to
marry
.
The
first
thing
I
would
recommend
him
,
*NL*
would
be
to
look
to
good
name
rather
than
to
wealth
,
for
a
good
woman
*NL*
does
not
win
a
good
name
merely
by
being
good
,
but
by
letting
it
be
seen
*NL*
that
she
is
so
,
and
open
looseness
and
freedom
do
much
more
damage
to
a
*NL*
woman
's
honour
than
secret
depravity
.
If
you
take
a
good
woman
into
your
*NL*
house
it
will
be
an
easy
matter
to
keep
her
good
,
and
even
to
make
her
*NL*
still
better
;
but
if
you
take
a
bad
one
you
will
find
it
hard
work
to
*NL*
mend
her
,
for
it
is
no
very
easy
matter
to
pass
from
one
extreme
to
*NL*
another
.
I
do
not
say
it
is
impossible
,
but
I
look
upon
it
as
difficult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
listening
to
all
this
,
said
to
himself
,
``
This
master
of
mine
,
*NL*
when
I
say
anything
that
has
weight
and
substance
,
says
I
might
take
a
*NL*
pulpit
in
hand
,
and
go
about
the
world
preaching
fine
sermons
;
but
I
say
*NL*
of
him
that
,
when
he
begins
stringing
maxims
together
and
giving
advice
*NL*
not
only
might
he
take
a
pulpit
in
hand
,
but
two
on
each
finger
,
and
go
*NL*
into
the
market-places
to
his
heart
's
content
.
Devil
take
you
for
a
*NL*
knight-errant
,
what
a
lot
of
things
you
know
!
I
used
to
think
in
my
heart
*NL*
that
the
only
thing
he
knew
was
what
belonged
to
his
chivalry
;
but
there
*NL*
is
nothing
he
wo
n't
have
a
finger
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
muttered
this
somewhat
aloud
,
and
his
master
overheard
him
,
and
*NL*
asked
,
``
What
art
thou
muttering
there
,
Sancho
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
saying
anything
or
muttering
anything
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
was
only
*NL*
saying
to
myself
that
I
wish
I
had
heard
what
your
worship
has
said
just
*NL*
now
before
I
married
;
perhaps
I
'd
say
now
,
`
The
ox
that
's
loose
licks
*NL*
himself
well
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
thy
Teresa
so
bad
then
,
Sancho
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
very
bad
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
but
she
is
not
very
good
;
at
*NL*
least
she
is
not
as
good
as
I
could
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
dost
wrong
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
to
speak
ill
of
thy
wife
;
*NL*
for
after
all
she
is
the
mother
of
thy
children
.
''
``
We
are
quits
,
''
*NL*
returned
Sancho
;
``
for
she
speaks
ill
of
me
whenever
she
takes
it
into
her
*NL*
head
,
especially
when
she
is
jealous
;
and
Satan
himself
could
not
put
up
*NL*
with
her
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fine
,
they
remained
three
days
with
the
newly
married
couple
,
by
whom
*NL*
they
were
entertained
and
treated
like
kings
.
Don
Quixote
begged
the
*NL*
fencing
licentiate
to
find
him
a
guide
to
show
him
the
way
to
the
cave
of
*NL*
Montesinos
,
as
he
had
a
great
desire
to
enter
it
and
see
with
his
own
*NL*
eyes
if
the
wonderful
tales
that
were
told
of
it
all
over
the
country
*NL*
were
true
.
The
licentiate
said
he
would
get
him
a
cousin
of
his
own
,
a
*NL*
famous
scholar
,
and
one
very
much
given
to
reading
books
of
chivalry
,
who
*NL*
would
have
great
pleasure
in
conducting
him
to
the
mouth
of
the
very
*NL*
cave
,
and
would
show
him
the
lakes
of
Ruidera
,
which
were
likewise
famous
*NL*
all
over
La
Mancha
,
and
even
all
over
Spain
;
and
he
assured
him
he
would
*NL*
find
him
entertaining
,
for
he
was
a
youth
who
could
write
books
good
*NL*
enough
to
be
printed
and
dedicated
to
princes
.
The
cousin
arrived
at
*NL*
last
,
leading
an
ass
in
foal
,
with
a
pack-saddle
covered
with
a
*NL*
parti-coloured
carpet
or
sackcloth
;
Sancho
saddled
Rocinante
,
got
Dapple
*NL*
ready
,
and
stocked
his
alforjas
,
along
with
which
went
those
of
the
*NL*
cousin
,
likewise
well
filled
;
and
so
,
commending
themselves
to
God
and
*NL*
bidding
farewell
to
all
,
they
set
out
,
taking
the
road
for
the
famous
*NL*
cave
of
Montesinos
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
Don
Quixote
asked
the
cousin
of
what
sort
and
character
his
*NL*
pursuits
,
avocations
,
and
studies
were
,
to
which
he
replied
that
he
was
*NL*
by
profession
a
humanist
,
and
that
his
pursuits
and
studies
were
making
*NL*
books
for
the
press
,
all
of
great
utility
and
no
less
entertainment
to
*NL*
the
nation
.
One
was
called
``
The
Book
of
Liveries
,
''
in
which
he
described
*NL*
seven
hundred
and
three
liveries
,
with
their
colours
,
mottoes
,
and
*NL*
ciphers
,
from
which
gentlemen
of
the
court
might
pick
and
choose
any
they
*NL*
fancied
for
festivals
and
revels
,
without
having
to
go
a-begging
for
them
*NL*
from
anyone
,
or
puzzling
their
brains
,
as
the
saying
is
,
to
have
them
*NL*
appropriate
to
their
objects
and
purposes
;
``
for
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
give
the
*NL*
jealous
,
the
rejected
,
the
forgotten
,
the
absent
,
what
will
suit
them
,
*NL*
and
fit
them
without
fail
.
I
have
another
book
,
too
,
which
I
shall
call
*NL*
`
Metamorphoses
,
or
the
Spanish
Ovid
,
'
one
of
rare
and
original
invention
,
*NL*
for
imitating
Ovid
in
burlesque
style
,
I
show
in
it
who
the
Giralda
of
*NL*
Seville
and
the
Angel
of
the
Magdalena
were
,
what
the
sewer
of
*NL*
Vecinguerra
at
Cordova
was
,
what
the
bulls
of
Guisando
,
the
Sierra
*NL*
Morena
,
the
Leganitos
and
Lavapies
fountains
at
Madrid
,
not
forgetting
*NL*
those
of
the
Piojo
,
of
the
Cano
Dorado
,
and
of
the
Priora
;
and
all
with
*NL*
their
allegories
,
metaphors
,
and
changes
,
so
that
they
are
amusing
,
*NL*
interesting
,
and
instructive
,
all
at
once
.
Another
book
I
have
which
I
*NL*
call
`
The
Supplement
to
Polydore
Vergil
,
'
which
treats
of
the
invention
*NL*
of
things
,
and
is
a
work
of
great
erudition
and
research
,
for
I
establish
*NL*
and
elucidate
elegantly
some
things
of
great
importance
which
Polydore
*NL*
omitted
to
mention
.
He
forgot
to
tell
us
who
was
the
first
man
in
the
*NL*
world
that
had
a
cold
in
his
head
,
and
who
was
the
first
to
try
*NL*
salivation
for
the
French
disease
,
but
I
give
it
accurately
set
forth
,
*NL*
and
quote
more
than
five-and-twenty
authors
in
proof
of
it
,
so
you
may
*NL*
perceive
I
have
laboured
to
good
purpose
and
that
the
book
will
be
of
*NL*
service
to
the
whole
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
who
had
been
very
attentive
to
the
cousin
's
words
,
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
senor
--
and
God
give
you
luck
in
printing
your
books-can
you
*NL*
tell
me
-LRB-
for
of
course
you
know
,
as
you
know
everything
-RRB-
who
was
the
*NL*
first
man
that
scratched
his
head
?
For
to
my
thinking
it
must
have
been
*NL*
our
father
Adam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
must
,
''
replied
the
cousin
;
``
for
there
is
no
doubt
but
Adam
had
a
*NL*
head
and
hair
;
and
being
the
first
man
in
the
world
he
would
have
*NL*
scratched
himself
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
think
,

said
Sancho
;
``
but
now
tell
me
,
who
was
the
first
tumbler
in
*NL*
the
world

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
brother
,

answered
the
cousin
,
``
I
could
not
at
this
moment
say
*NL*
positively
without
having
investigated
it
;
I
will
look
it
up
when
I
go
*NL*
back
to
where
I
have
my
books
,
and
will
satisfy
you
the
next
time
we
*NL*
meet

for
this
will
not
be
the
last
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here

senor

said
Sancho
,
``
do
n't
give
yourself
any
trouble
about
*NL*
it
,
for
I
have
just
this
minute
hit
upon
what
I
asked
you
.
The
first
*NL*
tumbler
in
the
world
,
you
must
know
,
was
Lucifer
,
when
they
cast
or
*NL*
pitched
him
out
of
heaven
;
for
he
came
tumbling
into
the
bottomless
pit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
friend
,
''
said
the
cousin
;
and
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
Sancho
,
*NL*
that
question
and
answer
are
not
thine
own

thou
hast
heard
them
from

some
one
else

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
peace
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
faith
,
if
I
take
to
asking
*NL*
questions
and
answering
,
I
'll
go
on
from
this
till
to-morrow
morning
.
*NL*
Nay
!
to
ask
foolish
things
and
answer
nonsense
I
need
n't
go
looking
for
*NL*
help
from
my
neighbours

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
said
more
than
thou
art
aware
of
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
``
for
there
are
some
who
weary
themselves
out
in
learning
and
proving
*NL*
things
that
,
after
they
are
known
and
proved
,
are
not
worth
a
farthing
to
*NL*
the
understanding
or
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
and
other
pleasant
conversation
the
day
went
by
,
and
that
night
*NL*
they
put
up
at
a
small
hamlet
whence
it
was
not
more
than
two
leagues
to
*NL*
the
cave
of
Montesinos
,
so
the
cousin
told
Don
Quixote
,
adding
,
that
if
*NL*
he
was
bent
upon
entering
it
,
it
would
be
requisite
for
him
to
provide
*NL*
himself
with
ropes
,
so
that
he
might
be
tied
and
lowered
into
its
depths
.
*NL*
Don
Quixote
said
that
even
if
it
reached
to
the
bottomless
pit
he
meant
*NL*
to
see
where
it
went
to
;
so
they
bought
about
a
hundred
fathoms
of
rope
,
*NL*
and
next
day
at
two
in
the
afternoon
they
arrived
at
the
cave
,
the
mouth
*NL*
of
which
is
spacious
and
wide
,
but
full
of
thorn
and
wild-fig
bushes
and
*NL*
brambles
and
briars
,
so
thick
and
matted
that
they
completely
close
it
up
*NL*
and
cover
it
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
coming
within
sight
of
it
the
cousin
,
Sancho
,
and
Don
Quixote
*NL*
dismounted
,
and
the
first
two
immediately
tied
the
latter
very
firmly
*NL*
with
the
ropes
,
and
as
they
were
girding
and
swathing
him
Sancho
said
to
*NL*
him
,
``
Mind
what
you
are
about
,
master
mine
;
do
n't
go
burying
yourself
*NL*
alive
,
or
putting
yourself
where
you
'll
be
like
a
bottle
put
to
cool
in
a
*NL*
well
;
it
's
no
affair
or
business
of
your
worship
's
to
become
the
explorer
*NL*
of
this
,
which
must
be
worse
than
a
Moorish
dungeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tie
me
and
hold
thy
peace
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
an
emprise
like
this
,
*NL*
friend
Sancho
,
was
reserved
for
me
;
''
and
said
the
guide
,
``
I
beg
of
you
,
*NL*
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
to
observe
carefully
and
examine
with
a
hundred
eyes
*NL*
everything
that
is
within
there
;
perhaps
there
may
be
some
things
for
me
*NL*
to
put
into
my
book
of
`
Transformations
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
drum
is
in
hands
that
will
know
how
to
beat
it
well
enough
,
''
said
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
said
this
and
finished
the
tying
-LRB-
which
was
not
over
the
*NL*
armour
but
only
over
the
doublet
-RRB-
Don
Quixote
observed
,
``
It
was
careless
*NL*
of
us
not
to
have
provided
ourselves
with
a
small
cattle-bell
to
be
tied
*NL*
on
the
rope
close
to
me
,
the
sound
of
which
would
show
that
I
was
still
*NL*
descending
and
alive
;
but
as
that
is
out
of
the
question
now
,
in
God
's
*NL*
hand
be
it
to
guide
me
;
''
and
forthwith
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
offered
up
a
prayer
to
heaven
,
imploring
God
to
aid
him
and
grant
*NL*
him
success
in
this
to
all
appearance
perilous
and
untried
adventure
,
and
*NL*
then
exclaimed
aloud
,
``
O
mistress
of
my
actions
and
movements
,
*NL*
illustrious
and
peerless
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
if
so
be
the
prayers
and
*NL*
supplications
of
this
fortunate
lover
can
reach
thy
ears
,
by
thy
*NL*
incomparable
beauty
I
entreat
thee
to
listen
to
them
,
for
they
but
ask
*NL*
thee
not
to
refuse
me
thy
favour
and
protection
now
that
I
stand
in
such
*NL*
need
of
them
.
I
am
about
to
precipitate
,
to
sink
,
to
plunge
myself
into
*NL*
the
abyss
that
is
here
before
me
,
only
to
let
the
world
know
that
while
*NL*
thou
dost
favour
me
there
is
no
impossibility
I
will
not
attempt
and
*NL*
accomplish
.
''
With
these
words
he
approached
the
cavern
,
and
perceived
*NL*
that
it
was
impossible
to
let
himself
down
or
effect
an
entrance
except
*NL*
by
sheer
force
or
cleaving
a
passage
;
so
drawing
his
sword
he
began
to
*NL*
demolish
and
cut
away
the
brambles
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
at
the
noise
*NL*
of
which
a
vast
multitude
of
crows
and
choughs
flew
out
of
it
so
thick
*NL*
and
so
fast
that
they
knocked
Don
Quixote
down
;
and
if
he
had
been
as
*NL*
much
of
a
believer
in
augury
as
he
was
a
Catholic
Christian
he
would
have
*NL*
taken
it
as
a
bad
omen
and
declined
to
bury
himself
in
such
a
place
.
He
*NL*
got
up
,
however
,
and
as
there
came
no
more
crows
,
or
night-birds
like
the
*NL*
bats
that
flew
out
at
the
same
time
with
the
crows
,
the
cousin
and
Sancho
*NL*
giving
him
rope
,
he
lowered
himself
into
the
depths
of
the
dread
cavern
;
*NL*
and
as
he
entered
it
Sancho
sent
his
blessing
after
him
,
making
a
*NL*
thousand
crosses
over
him
and
saying
,
``
God
,
and
the
Pena
de
Francia
,
and
*NL*
the
Trinity
of
Gaeta
guide
thee
,
flower
and
cream
of
knights-errant
.
*NL*
There
thou
goest
,
thou
dare-devil
of
the
earth
,
heart
of
steel
,
arm
of
*NL*
brass
;
once
more
,
God
guide
thee
and
send
thee
back
safe
,
sound
,
and
*NL*
unhurt
to
the
light
of
this
world
thou
art
leaving
to
bury
thyself
in
the
*NL*
darkness
thou
art
seeking
there
;
''
and
the
cousin
offered
up
almost
the
*NL*
same
prayers
and
supplications
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
kept
calling
to
them
to
give
him
rope
and
more
rope
,
and
they
*NL*
gave
it
out
little
by
little
,
and
by
the
time
the
calls
,
which
came
out
*NL*
of
the
cave
as
out
of
a
pipe
,
ceased
to
be
heard
they
had
let
down
the
*NL*
hundred
fathoms
of
rope
.
They
were
inclined
to
pull
Don
Quixote
up
again
,
*NL*
as
they
could
give
him
no
more
rope
;
however
,
they
waited
about
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
at
the
end
of
which
time
they
began
to
gather
in
the
rope
again
*NL*
with
great
ease
and
without
feeling
any
weight
,
which
made
them
fancy
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
remaining
below
;
and
persuaded
that
it
was
so
,
Sancho
wept
*NL*
bitterly
,
and
hauled
away
in
great
haste
in
order
to
settle
the
question
.
*NL*
When
,
however
,
they
had
come
to
,
as
it
seemed
,
rather
more
than
eighty
*NL*
fathoms
they
felt
a
weight
,
at
which
they
were
greatly
delighted
;
and
at
*NL*
last
,
at
ten
fathoms
more
,
they
saw
Don
Quixote
distinctly
,
and
Sancho
*NL*
called
out
to
him
,
saying
,
``
Welcome
back
,
senor
,
for
we
had
begun
to
*NL*
think
you
were
going
to
stop
there
to
found
a
family
.
''
But
Don
Quixote
*NL*
answered
not
a
word
,
and
drawing
him
out
entirely
they
perceived
he
had
*NL*
his
eyes
shut
and
every
appearance
of
being
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stretched
him
on
the
ground
and
untied
him
,
but
still
he
did
not
*NL*
awake
;
however
,
they
rolled
him
back
and
forwards
and
shook
and
pulled
*NL*
him
about
,
so
that
after
some
time
he
came
to
himself
,
stretching
himself
*NL*
just
as
if
he
were
waking
up
from
a
deep
and
sound
sleep
,
and
looking
*NL*
about
him
he
said
,
``
God
forgive
you
,
friends
;
ye
have
taken
me
away
from
*NL*
the
sweetest
and
most
delightful
existence
and
spectacle
that
ever
human
*NL*
being
enjoyed
or
beheld
.
Now
indeed
do
I
know
that
all
the
pleasures
of
*NL*
this
life
pass
away
like
a
shadow
and
a
dream
,
or
fade
like
the
flower
of
*NL*
the
field
.
O
ill-fated
Montesinos
!
O
sore-wounded
Durandarte
!
O
unhappy
*NL*
Belerma
!
O
tearful
Guadiana
,
and
ye
O
hapless
daughters
of
Ruidera
who
*NL*
show
in
your
waves
the
tears
that
flowed
from
your
beauteous
eyes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cousin
and
Sancho
Panza
listened
with
deep
attention
to
the
words
of
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
who
uttered
them
as
though
with
immense
pain
he
drew
them
up
*NL*
from
his
very
bowels
.
They
begged
of
him
to
explain
himself
,
and
tell
*NL*
them
what
he
had
seen
in
that
hell
down
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hell
do
you
call
it
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
call
it
by
no
such
name
,
for
it
*NL*
does
not
deserve
it
,
as
ye
shall
soon
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
begged
them
to
give
him
something
to
eat
,
as
he
was
very
hungry
.
*NL*
They
spread
the
cousin
's
sackcloth
on
the
grass
,
and
put
the
stores
of
*NL*
the
alforjas
into
requisition
,
and
all
three
sitting
down
lovingly
and
*NL*
sociably
,
they
made
a
luncheon
and
a
supper
of
it
all
in
one
;
and
when
*NL*
the
sackcloth
was
removed
,
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
said
,
``
Let
no
one
*NL*
rise
,
and
attend
to
me
,
my
sons
,
both
of
you
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
WONDERFUL
THINGS
THE
INCOMPARABLE
DON
QUIXOTE
SAID
HE
SAW
IN
THE
*NL*
PROFOUND
CAVE
OF
MONTESINOS
,
THE
IMPOSSIBILITY
AND
MAGNITUDE
OF
WHICH
*NL*
CAUSE
THIS
ADVENTURE
TO
BE
DEEMED
APOCRYPHAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sun
,
veiled
in
clouds
,
with
*NL*
subdued
light
and
tempered
beams
,
enabled
Don
Quixote
to
relate
,
without
*NL*
heat
or
inconvenience
,
what
he
had
seen
in
the
cave
of
Montesinos
to
his
*NL*
two
illustrious
hearers
,
and
he
began
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
matter
of
some
twelve
or
fourteen
times
a
man
's
height
down
in
this
*NL*
pit
,
on
the
right-hand
side
,
there
is
a
recess
or
space
,
roomy
enough
to
*NL*
contain
a
large
cart
with
its
mules
.
A
little
light
reaches
it
through
*NL*
some
chinks
or
crevices
,
communicating
with
it
and
open
to
the
surface
of
*NL*
the
earth
.
This
recess
or
space
I
perceived
when
I
was
already
growing
*NL*
weary
and
disgusted
at
finding
myself
hanging
suspended
by
the
rope
,
*NL*
travelling
downwards
into
that
dark
region
without
any
certainty
or
*NL*
knowledge
of
where
I
was
going
,
so
I
resolved
to
enter
it
and
rest
myself
*NL*
for
a
while
.
I
called
out
,
telling
you
not
to
let
out
more
rope
until
I
*NL*
bade
you
,
but
you
can
not
have
heard
me
.
I
then
gathered
in
the
rope
you
*NL*
were
sending
me
,
and
making
a
coil
or
pile
of
it
I
seated
myself
upon
it
,
*NL*
ruminating
and
considering
what
I
was
to
do
to
lower
myself
to
the
*NL*
bottom
,
having
no
one
to
hold
me
up
;
and
as
I
was
thus
deep
in
thought
*NL*
and
perplexity
,
suddenly
and
without
provocation
a
profound
sleep
fell
*NL*
upon
me
,
and
when
I
least
expected
it
,
I
know
not
how
,
I
awoke
and
found
*NL*
myself
in
the
midst
of
the
most
beautiful
,
delightful
meadow
that
nature
*NL*
could
produce
or
the
most
lively
human
imagination
conceive
.
I
opened
my
*NL*
eyes
,
I
rubbed
them
,
and
found
I
was
not
asleep
but
thoroughly
awake
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
I
felt
my
head
and
breast
to
satisfy
myself
whether
it
was
*NL*
I
myself
who
was
there
or
some
empty
delusive
phantom
;
but
touch
,
*NL*
feeling
,
the
collected
thoughts
that
passed
through
my
mind
,
all
*NL*
convinced
me
that
I
was
the
same
then
and
there
that
I
am
this
moment
.
*NL*
Next
there
presented
itself
to
my
sight
a
stately
royal
palace
or
castle
,
*NL*
with
walls
that
seemed
built
of
clear
transparent
crystal
;
and
through
*NL*
two
great
doors
that
opened
wide
therein
,
I
saw
coming
forth
and
*NL*
advancing
towards
me
a
venerable
old
man
,
clad
in
a
long
gown
of
*NL*
mulberry-coloured
serge
that
trailed
upon
the
ground
.
On
his
shoulders
*NL*
and
breast
he
had
a
green
satin
collegiate
hood
,
and
covering
his
head
a
*NL*
black
Milanese
bonnet
,
and
his
snow-white
beard
fell
below
his
girdle
.
He
*NL*
carried
no
arms
whatever
,
nothing
but
a
rosary
of
beads
bigger
than
*NL*
fair-sized
filberts
,
each
tenth
bead
being
like
a
moderate
ostrich
egg
;
*NL*
his
bearing
,
his
gait
,
his
dignity
and
imposing
presence
held
me
*NL*
spellbound
and
wondering
.
He
approached
me
,
and
the
first
thing
he
did
*NL*
was
to
embrace
me
closely
,
and
then
he
said
to
me
,
`
For
a
long
time
now
,
*NL*
O
valiant
knight
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
we
who
are
here
enchanted
in
*NL*
these
solitudes
have
been
hoping
to
see
thee
,
that
thou
mayest
make
known
*NL*
to
the
world
what
is
shut
up
and
concealed
in
this
deep
cave
,
called
the
*NL*
cave
of
Montesinos
,
which
thou
hast
entered
,
an
achievement
reserved
for
*NL*
thy
invincible
heart
and
stupendous
courage
alone
to
attempt
.
Come
with
*NL*
me
,
illustrious
sir
,
and
I
will
show
thee
the
marvels
hidden
within
this
*NL*
transparent
castle
,
whereof
I
am
the
alcaide
and
perpetual
warden
;
for
I
*NL*
am
Montesinos
himself
,
from
whom
the
cave
takes
its
name
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
instant
he
told
me
he
was
Montesinos
,
I
asked
him
if
the
story
they
*NL*
told
in
the
world
above
here
was
true
,
that
he
had
taken
out
the
heart
of
*NL*
his
great
friend
Durandarte
from
his
breast
with
a
little
dagger
,
and
*NL*
carried
it
to
the
lady
Belerma
,
as
his
friend
when
at
the
point
of
death
*NL*
had
commanded
him
.
He
said
in
reply
that
they
spoke
the
truth
in
every
*NL*
respect
except
as
to
the
dagger
,
for
it
was
not
a
dagger
,
nor
little
,
but
*NL*
a
burnished
poniard
sharper
than
an
awl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
poniard
must
have
been
made
by
Ramon
de
Hoces
the
Sevillian
,
''
said
*NL*
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
it
could
not
have
been
by
that
*NL*
poniard
maker
,
however
,
because
Ramon
de
Hoces
was
a
man
of
yesterday
,
*NL*
and
the
affair
of
Roncesvalles
,
where
this
mishap
occurred
,
was
long
ago
;
*NL*
but
the
question
is
of
no
great
importance
,
nor
does
it
affect
or
make
*NL*
any
alteration
in
the
truth
or
substance
of
the
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
cousin
;
``
continue
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
for
I
am
*NL*
listening
to
you
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
with
no
less
do
I
tell
the
tale
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
so
,
to
*NL*
proceed
--
the
venerable
Montesinos
led
me
into
the
palace
of
crystal
,
*NL*
where
,
in
a
lower
chamber
,
strangely
cool
and
entirely
of
alabaster
,
was
*NL*
an
elaborately
wrought
marble
tomb
,
upon
which
I
beheld
,
stretched
at
*NL*
full
length
,
a
knight
,
not
of
bronze
,
or
marble
,
or
jasper
,
as
are
seen
*NL*
on
other
tombs
,
but
of
actual
flesh
and
bone
.
His
right
hand
-LRB-
which
*NL*
seemed
to
me
somewhat
hairy
and
sinewy
,
a
sign
of
great
strength
in
its
*NL*
owner
-RRB-
lay
on
the
side
of
his
heart
;
but
before
I
could
put
any
question
*NL*
to
Montesinos
,
he
,
seeing
me
gazing
at
the
tomb
in
amazement
,
said
to
me
,
*NL*
`
This
is
my
friend
Durandarte
,
flower
and
mirror
of
the
true
lovers
and
*NL*
valiant
knights
of
his
time
.
He
is
held
enchanted
here
,
as
I
myself
and
*NL*
many
others
are
,
by
that
French
enchanter
Merlin
,
who
,
they
say
,
was
the
*NL*
devil
's
son
;
but
my
belief
is
,
not
that
he
was
the
devil
's
son
,
but
that
*NL*
he
knew
,
as
the
saying
is
,
a
point
more
than
the
devil
.
How
or
why
he
*NL*
enchanted
us
,
no
one
knows
,
but
time
will
tell
,
and
I
suspect
that
time
*NL*
is
not
far
off
.
What
I
marvel
at
is
,
that
I
know
it
to
be
as
sure
as
that
*NL*
it
is
now
day
,
that
Durandarte
ended
his
life
in
my
arms
,
and
that
,
after
*NL*
his
death
,
I
took
out
his
heart
with
my
own
hands
;
and
indeed
it
must
*NL*
have
weighed
more
than
two
pounds
,
for
,
according
to
naturalists
,
he
who
*NL*
has
a
large
heart
is
more
largely
endowed
with
valour
than
he
who
has
a
*NL*
small
one
.
Then
,
as
this
is
the
case
,
and
as
the
knight
did
really
die
,
*NL*
how
comes
it
that
he
now
moans
and
sighs
from
time
to
time
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
still
alive
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
he
said
this
,
the
wretched
Durandarte
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
O
cousin
Montesinos
!
*NL*
'
T
was
my
last
request
of
thee
,
*NL*
When
my
soul
hath
left
the
body
,
*NL*
And
that
lying
dead
I
be
,
*NL*
With
thy
poniard
or
thy
dagger
*NL*
Cut
the
heart
from
out
my
breast
,
*NL*
And
bear
it
to
Belerma
.
*NL*
This
was
my
last
request
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
which
,
the
venerable
Montesinos
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
*NL*
unhappy
knight
,
and
with
tearful
eyes
exclaimed
,
`
Long
since
,
Senor
*NL*
Durandarte
,
my
beloved
cousin
,
long
since
have
I
done
what
you
bade
me
on
*NL*
that
sad
day
when
I
lost
you
;
I
took
out
your
heart
as
well
as
I
could
,
*NL*
not
leaving
an
atom
of
it
in
your
breast
,
I
wiped
it
with
a
lace
*NL*
handkerchief
,
and
I
took
the
road
to
France
with
it
,
having
first
laid
*NL*
you
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
with
tears
enough
to
wash
and
cleanse
my
*NL*
hands
of
the
blood
that
covered
them
after
wandering
among
your
bowels
;
*NL*
and
more
by
token
,
O
cousin
of
my
soul
,
at
the
first
village
I
came
to
*NL*
after
leaving
Roncesvalles
,
I
sprinkled
a
little
salt
upon
your
heart
to
*NL*
keep
it
sweet
,
and
bring
it
,
if
not
fresh
,
at
least
pickled
,
into
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
lady
Belerma
,
whom
,
together
with
you
,
myself
,
Guadiana
*NL*
your
squire
,
the
duenna
Ruidera
and
her
seven
daughters
and
two
nieces
,
*NL*
and
many
more
of
your
friends
and
acquaintances
,
the
sage
Merlin
has
been
*NL*
keeping
enchanted
here
these
many
years
;
and
although
more
than
five
*NL*
hundred
have
gone
by
,
not
one
of
us
has
died
;
Ruidera
and
her
daughters
*NL*
and
nieces
alone
are
missing
,
and
these
,
because
of
the
tears
they
shed
,
*NL*
Merlin
,
out
of
the
compassion
he
seems
to
have
felt
for
them
,
changed
*NL*
into
so
many
lakes
,
which
to
this
day
in
the
world
of
the
living
,
and
in
*NL*
the
province
of
La
Mancha
,
are
called
the
Lakes
of
Ruidera
.
The
seven
*NL*
daughters
belong
to
the
kings
of
Spain
and
the
two
nieces
to
the
knights
*NL*
of
a
very
holy
order
called
the
Order
of
St.
John
.
Guadiana
your
squire
,
*NL*
likewise
bewailing
your
fate
,
was
changed
into
a
river
of
his
own
name
,
*NL*
but
when
he
came
to
the
surface
and
beheld
the
sun
of
another
heaven
,
so
*NL*
great
was
his
grief
at
finding
he
was
leaving
you
,
that
he
plunged
into
*NL*
the
bowels
of
the
earth
;
however
,
as
he
can
not
help
following
his
natural
*NL*
course
,
he
from
time
to
time
comes
forth
and
shows
himself
to
the
sun
and
*NL*
the
world
.
The
lakes
aforesaid
send
him
their
waters
,
and
with
these
,
and
*NL*
others
that
come
to
him
,
he
makes
a
grand
and
imposing
entrance
into
*NL*
Portugal
;
but
for
all
that
,
go
where
he
may
,
he
shows
his
melancholy
and
*NL*
sadness
,
and
takes
no
pride
in
breeding
dainty
choice
fish
,
only
coarse
*NL*
and
tasteless
sorts
,
very
different
from
those
of
the
golden
Tagus
.
All
*NL*
this
that
I
tell
you
now
,
O
cousin
mine
,
I
have
told
you
many
times
*NL*
before
,
and
as
you
make
no
answer
,
I
fear
that
either
you
believe
me
not
,
*NL*
or
do
not
hear
me
,
whereat
I
feel
God
knows
what
grief
.
I
have
now
news
*NL*
to
give
you
,
which
,
if
it
serves
not
to
alleviate
your
sufferings
,
will
*NL*
not
in
any
wise
increase
them
.
Know
that
you
have
here
before
you
-LRB-
open
*NL*
your
eyes
and
you
will
see
-RRB-
that
great
knight
of
whom
the
sage
Merlin
has
*NL*
prophesied
such
great
things
;
that
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
I
mean
,
who
*NL*
has
again
,
and
to
better
purpose
than
in
past
times
,
revived
in
these
*NL*
days
knight-errantry
,
long
since
forgotten
,
and
by
whose
intervention
and
*NL*
aid
it
may
be
we
shall
be
disenchanted
;
for
great
deeds
are
reserved
for
*NL*
great
men
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
if
that
may
not
be
,
'
said
the
wretched
Durandarte
in
a
low
and
*NL*
feeble
voice
,
`
if
that
may
not
be
,
then
,
my
cousin
,
I
say
``
patience
and
*NL*
shuffle
;
''
'
and
turning
over
on
his
side
,
he
relapsed
into
his
former
*NL*
silence
without
uttering
another
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
there
was
heard
a
great
outcry
and
lamentation
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
deep
sighs
and
bitter
sobs
.
I
looked
round
,
and
through
the
crystal
wall
*NL*
I
saw
passing
through
another
chamber
a
procession
of
two
lines
of
fair
*NL*
damsels
all
clad
in
mourning
,
and
with
white
turbans
of
Turkish
fashion
*NL*
on
their
heads
.
Behind
,
in
the
rear
of
these
,
there
came
a
lady
,
for
so
*NL*
from
her
dignity
she
seemed
to
be
,
also
clad
in
black
,
with
a
white
veil
*NL*
so
long
and
ample
that
it
swept
the
ground
.
Her
turban
was
twice
as
large
*NL*
as
the
largest
of
any
of
the
others
;
her
eyebrows
met
,
her
nose
was
*NL*
rather
flat
,
her
mouth
was
large
but
with
ruddy
lips
,
and
her
teeth
,
of
*NL*
which
at
times
she
allowed
a
glimpse
,
were
seen
to
be
sparse
and
ill-set
,
*NL*
though
as
white
as
peeled
almonds
.
She
carried
in
her
hands
a
fine
cloth
,
*NL*
and
in
it
,
as
well
as
I
could
make
out
,
a
heart
that
had
been
mummied
,
so
*NL*
parched
and
dried
was
it
.
Montesinos
told
me
that
all
those
forming
the
*NL*
procession
were
the
attendants
of
Durandarte
and
Belerma
,
who
were
*NL*
enchanted
there
with
their
master
and
mistress
,
and
that
the
last
,
she
*NL*
who
carried
the
heart
in
the
cloth
,
was
the
lady
Belerma
,
who
,
with
her
*NL*
damsels
,
four
days
in
the
week
went
in
procession
singing
,
or
rather
*NL*
weeping
,
dirges
over
the
body
and
miserable
heart
of
his
cousin
;
and
that
*NL*
if
she
appeared
to
me
somewhat
ill-favoured
or
not
so
beautiful
as
fame
*NL*
reported
her
,
it
was
because
of
the
bad
nights
and
worse
days
that
she
*NL*
passed
in
that
enchantment
,
as
I
could
see
by
the
great
dark
circles
*NL*
round
her
eyes
,
and
her
sickly
complexion
;
`
her
sallowness
,
and
the
rings
*NL*
round
her
eyes
,
'
said
he
,
`
are
not
caused
by
the
periodical
ailment
usual
*NL*
with
women
,
for
it
is
many
months
and
even
years
since
she
has
had
any
,
*NL*
but
by
the
grief
her
own
heart
suffers
because
of
that
which
she
holds
in
*NL*
her
hand
perpetually
,
and
which
recalls
and
brings
back
to
her
memory
the
*NL*
sad
fate
of
her
lost
lover
;
were
it
not
for
this
,
hardly
would
the
great
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
so
celebrated
in
all
these
parts
,
and
even
in
the
*NL*
world
,
come
up
to
her
for
beauty
,
grace
,
and
gaiety
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Hold
hard
!
'
said
I
at
this
,
`
tell
your
story
as
you
ought
,
Senor
Don
*NL*
Montesinos
,
for
you
know
very
well
that
all
comparisons
are
odious
,
and
*NL*
there
is
no
occasion
to
compare
one
person
with
another
;
the
peerless
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
is
what
she
is
,
and
the
lady
Dona
Belerma
is
what
she
*NL*
is
and
has
been
,
and
that
's
enough
.
'
To
which
he
made
answer
,
`
Forgive
*NL*
me
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
;
I
own
I
was
wrong
and
spoke
unadvisedly
in
saying
*NL*
that
the
lady
Dulcinea
could
scarcely
come
up
to
the
lady
Belerma
;
for
it
*NL*
were
enough
for
me
to
have
learned
,
by
what
means
I
know
not
,
that
you
*NL*
are
her
knight
,
to
make
me
bite
my
tongue
out
before
I
compared
her
to
*NL*
anything
save
heaven
itself
.
'
After
this
apology
which
the
great
*NL*
Montesinos
made
me
,
my
heart
recovered
itself
from
the
shock
I
had
*NL*
received
in
hearing
my
lady
compared
with
Belerma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
I
wonder
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
your
worship
did
not
get
upon
the
*NL*
old
fellow
and
bruise
every
bone
of
him
with
kicks
,
and
pluck
his
beard
*NL*
until
you
did
n't
leave
a
hair
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Sancho
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
it
would
not
have
been
right
*NL*
in
me
to
do
that
,
for
we
are
all
bound
to
pay
respect
to
the
aged
,
even
*NL*
though
they
be
not
knights
,
but
especially
to
those
who
are
,
and
who
are
*NL*
enchanted
;
I
only
know
I
gave
him
as
good
as
he
brought
in
the
many
other
*NL*
questions
and
answers
we
exchanged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
understand
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
''
remarked
the
cousin
here
,
``
how
*NL*
it
is
that
your
worship
,
in
such
a
short
space
of
time
as
you
have
been
*NL*
below
there
,
could
have
seen
so
many
things
,
and
said
and
answered
so
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
is
it
since
I
went
down
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
better
than
an
hour
,
''
replied
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
can
not
be
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
because
night
overtook
me
while
*NL*
I
was
there
,
and
day
came
,
and
it
was
night
again
and
day
again
three
*NL*
times
;
so
that
,
by
my
reckoning
,
I
have
been
three
days
in
those
remote
*NL*
regions
beyond
our
ken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
master
must
be
right
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
for
as
everything
that
has
*NL*
happened
to
him
is
by
enchantment
,
maybe
what
seems
to
us
an
hour
would
*NL*
seem
three
days
and
nights
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,

said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
your
worship
eat
anything
all
that
time

asked
the
*NL*
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
touched
a
morsel

Don
Quixote
,
``

the

They
neither
eat

Don

they
subject

greater
excrements

grow

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do

now

asked
Sancho

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not

Don

;
``
at

,
during
those
three
days

I
was
with

an

I
either

Sancho

be
all
in
place
here
-RRB-
,
he
showed
me
*NL*
three
country
girls
who
went
skipping
and
capering
like
goats
over
the
*NL*
pleasant
fields
there
,
and
the
instant
I
beheld
them
I
knew
one
to
be
the
*NL*
peerless
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
and
the
other
two
those
same
country
girls
*NL*
that
were
with
her
and
that
we
spoke
to
on
the
road
from
El
Toboso
!
I
*NL*
asked
Montesinos
if
he
knew
them
,
and
he
told
me
he
did
not
,
but
he
*NL*
thought
they
must
be
some
enchanted
ladies
of
distinction
,
for
it
was
*NL*
only
a
few
days
before
that
they
had
made
their
appearance
in
those
*NL*
meadows
;
but
I
was
not
to
be
surprised
at
that
,
because
there
were
a
*NL*
great
many
other
ladies
there
of
times
past
and
present
,
enchanted
in
*NL*
various
strange
shapes
,
and
among
them
he
had
recognised
Queen
Guinevere
*NL*
and
her
dame
Quintanona
,
she
who
poured
out
the
wine
for
Lancelot
when
he
*NL*
came
from
Britain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sancho
Panza
heard
his
master
say
this
he
was
ready
to
take
leave
of
*NL*
his
senses
,
or
die
with
laughter
;
for
,
as
he
knew
the
real
truth
about
*NL*
the
pretended
enchantment
of
Dulcinea
,
in
which
he
himself
had
been
the
*NL*
enchanter
and
concocter
of
all
the
evidence
,
he
made
up
his
mind
at
last
*NL*
that
,
beyond
all
doubt
,
his
master
was
out
of
his
wits
and
stark
mad
,
so
*NL*
he
said
to
him
,
``
It
was
an
evil
hour
,
a
worse
season
,
and
a
sorrowful
*NL*
day
,
when
your
worship
,
dear
master
mine
,
went
down
to
the
other
world
,
*NL*
and
an
unlucky
moment
when
you
met
with
Senor
Montesinos
,
who
has
sent
*NL*
you
back
to
us
like
this
.
You
were
well
enough
here
above
in
your
full
*NL*
senses
,
such
as
God
had
given
you
,
delivering
maxims
and
giving
advice
at
*NL*
every
turn
,
and
not
as
you
are
now
,
talking
the
greatest
nonsense
that
*NL*
can
be
imagined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
know
thee
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
heed
not
thy
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
your
worship
's
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
whether
you
beat
me
or
kill
me
for
*NL*
those
I
have
spoken
,
and
will
speak
if
you
do
n't
correct
and
mend
your
*NL*
own
.
But
tell
me
,
while
we
are
still
at
peace
,
how
or
by
what
did
you
*NL*
recognise
the
lady
our
mistress
;
and
if
you
spoke
to
her
,
what
did
you
*NL*
say
,
and
what
did
she
answer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recognised
her
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
by
her
wearing
the
same
garments
*NL*
she
wore
when
thou
didst
point
her
out
to
me
.
I
spoke
to
her
,
but
she
did
*NL*
not
utter
a
word
in
reply
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
turned
her
back
on
me
and
*NL*
took
to
flight
,
at
such
a
pace
that
crossbow
bolt
could
not
have
*NL*
overtaken
her
.
I
wished
to
follow
her
,
and
would
have
done
so
had
not
*NL*
Montesinos
recommended
me
not
to
take
the
trouble
as
it
would
be
useless
,
*NL*
particularly
as
the
time
was
drawing
near
when
it
would
be
necessary
for
*NL*
me
to
quit
the
cavern
.
He
told
me
,
moreover
,
that
in
course
of
time
he
*NL*
would
let
me
know
how
he
and
Belerma
,
and
Durandarte
,
and
all
who
were
*NL*
there
,
were
to
be
disenchanted
.
But
of
all
I
saw
and
observed
down
there
,
*NL*
what
gave
me
most
pain
was
,
that
while
Montesinos
was
speaking
to
me
,
one
*NL*
of
the
two
companions
of
the
hapless
Dulcinea
approached
me
on
one
*NL*
without
my
having
seen
her
coming
,
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
said
to
me
,
*NL*
in
a
low
,
agitated
voice
,
`
My
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
kisses
your
*NL*
worship
's
hands
,
and
entreats
you
to
do
her
the
favour
of
letting
her
*NL*
know
how
you
are
;
and
,
being
in
great
need
,
she
also
entreats
your
*NL*
worship
as
earnestly
as
she
can
to
be
so
good
as
to
lend
her
half
a
dozen
*NL*
reals
,
or
as
much
as
you
may
have
about
you
,
on
this
new
dimity
petticoat
*NL*
that
I
have
here
;
and
she
promises
to
repay
them
very
speedily
.
'
I
was
*NL*
amazed
and
taken
aback
by
such
a
message
,
and
turning
to
Senor
Montesinos
*NL*
I
asked
him
,
`
Is
it
possible
,
Senor
Montesinos
,
that
persons
of
*NL*
distinction
under
enchantment
can
be
in
need
?
'
To
which
he
replied
,
*NL*
`
Believe
me
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
that
which
is
called
need
is
to
be
met
*NL*
with
everywhere
,
and
penetrates
all
quarters
and
reaches
everyone
,
and
*NL*
does
not
spare
even
the
enchanted
;
and
as
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
*NL*
sends
to
beg
those
six
reals
,
and
the
pledge
is
to
all
appearance
a
good
*NL*
one
,
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
give
them
to
her
,
for
no
doubt
she
*NL*
must
be
in
some
great
strait
.
'
'
I
will
take
no
pledge
of
her
,
'
I
replied
,
*NL*
`
nor
yet
can
I
give
her
what
she
asks
,
for
all
I
have
is
four
reals
;
*NL*
which
I
gave
-LRB-
they
were
those
which
thou
,
Sancho
,
gavest
me
the
other
day
*NL*
to
bestow
in
alms
upon
the
poor
I
met
along
the
road
-RRB-
,
and
I
said
,
`
Tell
*NL*
your
mistress
,
my
dear
,
that
I
am
grieved
to
the
heart
because
of
her
*NL*
distresses
,
and
wish
I
was
a
Fucar
to
remedy
them
,
and
that
I
would
have
*NL*
her
know
that
I
can
not
be
,
and
ought
not
be
,
in
health
while
deprived
of
*NL*
the
happiness
of
seeing
her
and
enjoying
her
discreet
conversation
,
and
*NL*
that
I
implore
her
as
earnestly
as
I
can
,
to
allow
herself
to
be
seen
and
*NL*
addressed
by
this
her
captive
servant
and
forlorn
knight
.
Tell
her
,
too
,
*NL*
that
when
she
least
expects
it
she
will
hear
it
announced
that
I
have
*NL*
made
an
oath
and
vow
after
the
fashion
of
that
which
the
Marquis
of
*NL*
Mantua
made
to
avenge
his
nephew
Baldwin
,
when
he
found
him
at
the
point
*NL*
of
death
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
,
which
was
,
not
to
eat
bread
off
a
*NL*
tablecloth
,
and
other
trifling
matters
which
he
added
,
until
he
had
*NL*
avenged
him
;
and
I
will
make
the
same
to
take
no
rest
,
and
to
roam
the
*NL*
seven
regions
of
the
earth
more
thoroughly
than
the
Infante
Don
Pedro
of
*NL*
Portugal
ever
roamed
them
,
until
I
have
disenchanted
her
.
'
`
All
that
and
*NL*
more
,
you
owe
my
lady
,
'
the
damsel
's
answer
to
me
,
and
taking
the
four
*NL*
reals
,
instead
of
making
me
a
curtsey
she
cut
a
caper
,
springing
two
full
*NL*
yards
into
the
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
blessed
God
!
''
exclaimed
Sancho
aloud
at
this
,
``
is
it
possible
that
*NL*
such
things
can
be
in
the
world
,
and
that
enchanters
and
enchantments
can
*NL*
have
such
power
in
it
as
to
have
changed
my
master
's
right
senses
into
a
*NL*
craze
so
full
of
absurdity
!
O
senor
,
senor
,
for
God
's
sake
,
consider
*NL*
yourself
,
have
a
care
for
your
honour

give
no
credit

this
silly

stuff
that
has
left
you
scant
and
short
of
wits

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
talkest
in
this
way
because
thou
lovest
me

Sancho

said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
``
and
not
being
experienced
in
the
things
of

*NL*
everything
that

some
difficulty
about
it

to
thee
impossible

pass

as
I
said
before

I
will
tell
thee
some
of
the
*NL*
things
I
saw
down
there
which
will
make
thee
believe
what
I
have
related

CHAPTER
XXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
ARE
RELATED
A
THOUSAND
TRIFLING
MATTERS
,
AS
TRIVIAL
AS
THEY
ARE
*NL*
NECESSARY
TO
THE
RIGHT
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THIS
GREAT
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
translated
this
great
history
from
the
original
written
by
its
*NL*
first
author
,
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
,
says
that
on
coming
to
the
chapter
*NL*
giving
the
adventures
of
the
cave
of
Montesinos
he
found
written
on
the
*NL*
margin
of
it
,
in
Hamete
's
own
hand
,
these
exact
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
convince
or
persuade
myself
that
everything
that
is
written
in
*NL*
the
preceding
chapter
could
have
precisely
happened
to
the
valiant
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
and
for
this
reason
,
that
all
the
adventures
that
have
occurred
*NL*
up
to
the
present
have
been
possible
and
probable
;
but
as
for
this
one
of
*NL*
the
cave
,
I
see
no
way
of
accepting
it
as
true
,
as
it
passes
all
*NL*
reasonable
bounds
.
For
me
to
believe
that
Don
Quixote
could
lie
,
he
being
*NL*
the
most
truthful
gentleman
and
the
noblest
knight
of
his
time
,
is
*NL*
impossible
;
he
would
not
have
told
a
lie
though
he
were
shot
to
death
*NL*
with
arrows
.
On
the
other
hand
,
I
reflect
that
he
related
and
told
the
*NL*
story
with
all
the
circumstances
detailed
,
and
that
he
could
not
in
so
*NL*
short
a
space
have
fabricated
such
a
vast
complication
of
absurdities
;
*NL*
if
,
then
,
this
adventure
seems
apocryphal
,
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
;
and
*NL*
so
,
without
affirming
its
falsehood
or
its
truth
,
I
write
it
down
.
Decide
*NL*
for
thyself
in
thy
wisdom
,
reader
;
for
I
am
not
bound
,
nor
is
it
in
my
*NL*
power
,
to
do
more
;
though
certain
it
is
they
say
that
at
the
time
of
his
*NL*
death
he
retracted
,
and
said
he
had
invented
it
,
thinking
it
matched
and
*NL*
tallied
with
the
adventures
he
had
read
of
in
his
histories
.
''
And
then
he
*NL*
goes
on
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
cousin
was
amazed
as
well
at
Sancho
's
boldness
as
at
the
patience
of
*NL*
his
master
,
and
concluded
that
the
good
temper
the
latter
displayed
arose
*NL*
from
the
happiness
he
felt
at
having
seen
his
lady
Dulcinea
,
even
*NL*
enchanted
as
she
was
;
because
otherwise
the
words
and
language
Sancho
had
*NL*
addressed
to
him
deserved
a
thrashing
;
for
indeed
he
seemed
to
him
to
*NL*
have
been
rather
impudent
to
his
master
,
to
whom
he
now
observed
,
``
I
,
*NL*
Senor
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
look
upon
the
time
I
have
spent
in
*NL*
travelling
with
your
worship
as
very
well
employed
,
for
I
have
gained
*NL*
four
things
in
the
course
of
it
;
the
first
is
that
I
have
made
your
*NL*
acquaintance
,
which
I
consider
great
good
fortune
;
the
second
,
that
I
*NL*
have
learned
what
the
cave
of
Montesinos
contains
,
together
with
the
*NL*
transformations
of
Guadiana
and
of
the
lakes
of
Ruidera
;
which
will
be
of
*NL*
use
to
me
for
the
Spanish
Ovid
that
I
have
in
hand
;
the
third
,
to
have
*NL*
discovered
the
antiquity
of
cards
,
that
they
were
in
use
at
least
in
the
*NL*
time
of
Charlemagne
,
as
may
be
inferred
from
the
words
you
say
Durandarte
*NL*
uttered
when
,
at
the
end
of
that
long
spell
while
Montesinos
was
talking
*NL*
to
him
,
he
woke
up
and
said
,
`
Patience
and
shuffle
.
'
This
phrase
and
*NL*
expression
he
could
not
have
learned
while
he
was
enchanted
,
but
only
*NL*
before
he
had
become
so
,
in
France
,
and
in
the
time
of
the
aforesaid
*NL*
emperor
Charlemagne
.
And
this
demonstration
is
just
the
thing
for
me
for
*NL*
that
other
book
I
am
writing
,
the
`
Supplement
to
Polydore
Vergil
on
the
*NL*
Invention
of
Antiquities
;
'
for
I
believe
he
never
thought
of
inserting
*NL*
that
of
cards
in
his
book
,
as
I
mean
to
do
in
mine
,
and
it
will
be
a
*NL*
matter
of
great
importance
,
particularly
when
I
can
cite
so
grave
and
*NL*
veracious
an
authority
as
Senor
Durandarte
.
And
the
fourth
thing
is
,
that
*NL*
I
have
ascertained
the
source
of
the
river
Guadiana
,
heretofore
unknown
*NL*
to
mankind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
I
should
like
to
know
,
if
by
*NL*
God
's
favour
they
grant
you
a
licence
to
print
those
books
of
yours-which
*NL*
I
doubt
--
to
whom
do
you
mean
to
dedicate
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
lords
and
grandees
in
Spain
to
whom
they
can
be
dedicated
,
''
*NL*
said
the
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
many
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
not
that
they
are
unworthy
of
it
,
but
*NL*
because
they
do
not
care
to
accept
books
and
incur
the
obligation
of
*NL*
making
the
return
that
seems
due
to
the
author
's
labour
and
courtesy
.
One
*NL*
prince
I
know
who
makes
up
for
all
the
rest
,
and
more-how
much
more
,
if
I
*NL*
ventured
to
say
,
perhaps
I
should
stir
up
envy
in
many
a
noble
breast
;
*NL*
but
let
this
stand
over
for
some
more
convenient
time
,
and
let
us
go
and
*NL*
look
for
some
place
to
shelter
ourselves
in
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
far
from
this
,
''
said
the
cousin
,
``
there
is
a
hermitage
,
where
there
*NL*
lives
a
hermit
,
who
they
say
was
a
soldier
,
and
who
has
the
reputation
of
*NL*
being
a
good
Christian
and
a
very
intelligent
and
charitable
man
.
Close
*NL*
to
the
hermitage
he
has
a
small
house
which
he
built
at
his
own
cost
,
but
*NL*
though
small
it
is
large
enough
for
the
reception
of
guests
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
this
hermit
any
hens
,
do
you
think
?

asked
Sancho
.

``
Few
hermits
are
without
them
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
those
we
see
*NL*
now-a-days
are
not
like
the
hermits
of
the
Egyptian
deserts
who
were
clad
*NL*
in
palm-leaves
,
and
lived
on
the
roots
of
the
earth
.
But
do
not
think
*NL*
that
by
praising
these
I
am
disparaging
the
others
;
all
I
mean
to
say
is
*NL*
that
the
penances
of
those
of
the
present
day
do
not
come
up
to
the
*NL*
asceticism
and
austerity
of
former
times
;
but
it
does
not
follow
from
*NL*
this
that
they
are
not
all
worthy
;
at
least
I
think
them
so
;
and
at
the
*NL*
worst
the
hypocrite
who
pretends
to
be
good
does
less
harm
than
the
open
*NL*
sinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
they
saw
approaching
the
spot
where
they
stood
a
man
on
*NL*
foot
,
proceeding
at
a
rapid
pace
,
and
beating
a
mule
loaded
with
lances
*NL*
and
halberds
.
When
he
came
up
to
them
,
he
saluted
them
and
passed
on
*NL*
without
stopping
.
Don
Quixote
called
to
him
,
``
Stay
,
good
fellow
;
you
seem
*NL*
to
be
making
more
haste
than
suits
that
mule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
stop
,
senor
,
''
answered
the
man
;
``
for
the
arms
you
see
I
carry
*NL*
here
are
to
be
used
tomorrow
,
so
I
must
not
delay
;
God
be
with
you
.
But
*NL*
if
you
want
to
know
what
I
am
carrying
them
for
,
I
mean
to
lodge
to-night
*NL*
at
the
inn
that
is
beyond
the
hermitage
,
and
if
you
be
going
the
same
*NL*
road
you
will
find
me
there
,
and
I
will
tell
you
some
curious
things
;
*NL*
once
more
God
be
with
you
;
''
and
he
urged
on
his
mule
at
such
a
pace
that
*NL*
Don
Quixote
had
no
time
to
ask
him
what
these
curious
things
were
that
he
*NL*
meant
to
tell
them
;
and
as
he
was
somewhat
inquisitive
,
and
always
*NL*
tortured
by
his
anxiety
to
learn
something
new
,
he
decided
to
set
out
at
*NL*
once
,
and
go
and
pass
the
night
at
the
inn
instead
of
stopping
at
the
*NL*
hermitage
,
where
the
cousin
would
have
had
them
halt
.
Accordingly
they
*NL*
mounted
and
all
three
took
the
direct
road
for
the
inn
,
which
they
*NL*
reached
a
little
before
nightfall
.
On
the
road
the
cousin
proposed
they
*NL*
should
go
up
to
the
hermitage
to
drink
a
sup
.
The
instant
Sancho
heard
*NL*
this
he
steered
his
Dapple
towards
it
,
and
Don
Quixote
and
the
cousin
did
*NL*
the
same
;
but
it
seems
Sancho
's
bad
luck
so
ordered
it
that
the
hermit
*NL*
was
not
at
home
,
for
so
a
sub-hermit
they
found
in
the
hermitage
told
*NL*
them
.
They
called
for
some
of
the
best
.
She
replied
that
her
master
had
*NL*
none
,
but
that
if
they
liked
cheap
water
she
would
give
it
with
great
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
found
any
in
water
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
there
are
wells
along
the
road
*NL*
where
I
could
have
had
enough
of
it
.
Ah
,
Camacho
's
wedding
,
and
plentiful
*NL*
house
of
Don
Diego
,
how
often
do
I
miss
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
the
hermitage
,
they
pushed
on
towards
the
inn
,
and
a
little
*NL*
farther
they
came
upon
a
youth
who
was
pacing
along
in
front
of
them
at
*NL*
no
great
speed
,
so
that
they
overtook
him
.
He
carried
a
sword
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
slung
on
it
a
budget
or
bundle
of
his
clothes
apparently
,
*NL*
probably
his
breeches
or
pantaloons
,
and
his
cloak
and
a
shirt
or
two
;
*NL*
for
he
had
on
a
short
jacket
of
velvet
with
a
gloss
like
satin
on
it
in
*NL*
places
,
and
had
his
shirt
out
;
his
stockings
were
of
silk
,
and
his
shoes
*NL*
square-toed
as
they
wear
them
at
court
.
His
age
might
have
been
eighteen
*NL*
or
nineteen
;
he
was
of
a
merry
countenance
,
and
to
all
appearance
of
an
*NL*
active
habit
,
and
he
went
along
singing
seguidillas
to
beguile
the
*NL*
wearisomeness
of
the
road
.
As
they
came
up
with
him
he
was
just
finishing
*NL*
one
,
which
the
cousin
got
by
heart
and
they
say
ran
thus
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
'm
off
to
the
wars
*NL*
For
the
want
of
pence
,
*NL*
Oh
,
had
I
but
money
*NL*
I
'd
show
more
sense
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
to
address
him
was
Don
Quixote
,
who
said
,
``
You
travel
very
*NL*
airily
,
sir
gallant
;
whither
bound
,
may
we
ask
,
if
it
is
your
pleasure
to
*NL*
tell
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
youth
replied
,
``
The
heat
and
my
poverty
are
the
reason
of
my
*NL*
travelling
so
airily
,
and
it
is
to
the
wars
that
I
am
bound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
poverty
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
;
``
the
heat
one
can
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
replied
the
youth
,
``
in
this
bundle
I
carry
velvet
pantaloons
to
*NL*
match
this
jacket
;
if
I
wear
them
out
on
the
road
,
I
shall
not
be
able
to
*NL*
make
a
decent
appearance
in
them
in
the
city
,
and
I
have
not
the
*NL*
wherewithal
to
buy
others
;
and
so
for
this
reason
,
as
well
as
to
keep
*NL*
myself
cool
,
I
am
making
my
way
in
this
fashion
to
overtake
some
*NL*
companies
of
infantry
that
are
not
twelve
leagues
off
,
in
which
I
shall
*NL*
enlist
,
and
there
will
be
no
want
of
baggage
trains
to
travel
with
after
*NL*
that
to
the
place
of
embarkation
,
which
they
say
will
be
Carthagena
;
I
*NL*
would
rather
have
the
King
for
a
master
,
and
serve
him
in
the
wars
,
than
*NL*
serve
a
court
pauper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
get
any
bounty
,
now
?
''
asked
the
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
been
in
the
service
of
some
grandee
of
Spain
or
personage
of
*NL*
distinction
,
''
replied
the
youth
,
``
I
should
have
been
safe
to
get
it
;
for
*NL*
that
is
the
advantage
of
serving
good
masters
,
that
out
of
the
servants
'
*NL*
hall
men
come
to
be
ancients
or
captains
,
or
get
a
good
pension
.
But
I
,
*NL*
to
my
misfortune
,
always
served
place-hunters
and
adventurers
,
whose
keep
*NL*
and
wages
were
so
miserable
and
scanty
that
half
went
in
paying
for
the
*NL*
starching
of
one
's
collars
;
it
would
be
a
miracle
indeed
if
a
page
*NL*
volunteer
ever
got
anything
like
a
reasonable
bounty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
tell
me
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
''
asked
Don
Quixote
,
``
is
it
possible
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
that
all
the
time
you
served
you
never
got
any
livery
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
gave
me
two
,
''
replied
the
page
;
``
but
just
as
when
one
quits
a
*NL*
religious
community
before
making
profession
,
they
strip
him
of
the
dress
*NL*
of
the
order
and
give
him
back
his
own
clothes
,
so
did
my
masters
return
*NL*
me
mine
;
for
as
soon
as
the
business
on
which
they
came
to
court
was
*NL*
finished
,
they
went
home
and
took
back
the
liveries
they
had
given
merely
*NL*
for
show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
spilorceria
!
--
as
an
Italian
would
say
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
for
*NL*
all
that
,
consider
yourself
happy
in
having
left
court
with
as
worthy
an
*NL*
object
as
you
have
,
for
there
is
nothing
on
earth
more
honourable
or
*NL*
profitable
than
serving
,
first
of
all
God
,
and
then
one
's
king
and
*NL*
natural
lord
,
particularly
in
the
profession
of
arms
,
by
which
,
if
not
*NL*
more
wealth
,
at
least
more
honour
is
to
be
won
than
by
letters
,
as
I
have
*NL*
said
many
a
time
;
for
though
letters
may
have
founded
more
great
houses
*NL*
than
arms
,
still
those
founded
by
arms
have
I
know
not
what
superiority
*NL*
over
those
founded
by
letters
,
and
a
certain
splendour
belonging
to
them
*NL*
that
distinguishes
them
above
all
.
And
bear
in
mind
what
I
am
now
about
*NL*
to
say
to
you
,
for
it
will
be
of
great
use
and
comfort
to
you
in
time
of
*NL*
trouble
;
it
is
,
not
to
let
your
mind
dwell
on
the
adverse
chances
that
*NL*
may
befall
you
;
for
the
worst
of
all
is
death
,
and
if
it
be
a
good
death
,
*NL*
the
best
of
all
is
to
die
.
They
asked
Julius
Caesar
,
the
valiant
Roman
*NL*
emperor
,
what
was
the
best
death
.
He
answered
,
that
which
is
unexpected
,
*NL*
which
comes
suddenly
and
unforeseen
;
and
though
he
answered
like
a
pagan
,
*NL*
and
one
without
the
knowledge
of
the
true
God
,
yet
,
as
far
as
sparing
our
*NL*
feelings
is
concerned
,
he
was
right
;
for
suppose
you
are
killed
in
the
*NL*
first
engagement
or
skirmish
,
whether
by
a
cannon
ball
or
blown
up
by
*NL*
mine
,
what
matters
it
?
It
is
only
dying
,
and
all
is
over
;
and
according
*NL*
to
Terence
,
a
soldier
shows
better
dead
in
battle
,
than
alive
and
safe
in
*NL*
flight
;
and
the
good
soldier
wins
fame
in
proportion
as
he
is
obedient
to
*NL*
his
captains
and
those
in
command
over
him
.
And
remember
,
my
son
,
that
it
*NL*
is
better
for
the
soldier
to
smell
of
gunpowder
than
of
civet
,
and
that
*NL*
if
old
age
should
come
upon
you
in
this
honourable
calling
,
though
you
*NL*
may
be
covered
with
wounds
and
crippled
and
lame
,
it
will
not
come
upon
*NL*
you
without
honour
,
and
that
such
as
poverty
can
not
lessen
;
especially
*NL*
now
that
provisions
are
being
made
for
supporting
and
relieving
old
and
*NL*
disabled
soldiers
;
for
it
is
not
right
to
deal
with
them
after
the
*NL*
fashion
of
those
who
set
free
and
get
rid
of
their
black
slaves
when
they
*NL*
are
old
and
useless
,
and
,
turning
them
out
of
their
houses
under
the
*NL*
pretence
of
making
them
free
,
make
them
slaves
to
hunger
,
from
which
they
*NL*
can
not
expect
to
be
released
except
by
death
.
But
for
the
present
I
wo
n't
*NL*
say
more
than
get
ye
up
behind
me
on
my
horse
as
far
as
the
inn
,
and
sup
*NL*
with
me
there
,
and
to-morrow
you
shall
pursue
your
journey
,
and
God
give
*NL*
you
as
good
speed
as
your
intentions
deserve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
page
did
not
accept
the
invitation
to
mount
,
though
he
did
that
to
*NL*
supper
at
the
inn
;
and
here
they
say
Sancho
said
to
himself
,
``
God
be
with
*NL*
you
for
a
master
;
is
it
possible
that
a
man
who
can
say
things
so
many
*NL*
and
so
good
as
he
has
said
just
now
,
can
say
that
he
saw
the
impossible
*NL*
absurdities
he
reports
about
the
cave
of
Montesinos
?
Well
,
well
,
we
shall
*NL*
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
just
as
night
was
falling
,
they
reached
the
inn
,
and
it
was
not
*NL*
without
satisfaction
that
Sancho
perceived
his
master
took
it
for
a
real
*NL*
inn
,
and
not
for
a
castle
as
usual
.
The
instant
they
entered
Don
Quixote
*NL*
asked
the
landlord
after
the
man
with
the
lances
and
halberds
,
and
was
*NL*
told
that
he
was
in
the
stable
seeing
to
his
mule
;
which
was
what
Sancho
*NL*
and
the
cousin
proceeded
to
do
for
their
beasts
,
giving
the
best
manger
*NL*
and
the
best
place
in
the
stable
to
Rocinante

WHEREIN
IS
SET
DOWN
THE
BRAYING
ADVENTURE
,
AND
THE
DROLL
ONE

,
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
MEMORABLE
DIVINATIONS
OF
THE
DIVINING

APE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
bread
would
not
bake
,
as
the
common
saying
is
,
until
he
had
*NL*
heard
and
learned
the
curious
things
promised
by
the
man
who
carried
the
*NL*
arms
.
He
went
to
seek
him
where
the
innkeeper
said
he
was
and
having
*NL*
found
him
,
bade
him
say
now
at
any
rate
what
he
had
to
say
in
answer
to
*NL*
the
question
he
had
asked
him
on
the
road
.
``
The
tale
of
my
wonders
must
*NL*
be
taken
more
leisurely
and
not
standing
,
''
said
the
man
;
``
let
me
finish
*NL*
foddering
my
beast
,
good
sir
;
and
then
I
'll
tell
you
things
that
will
*NL*
astonish
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
wait
for
that
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
I
'll
help
you
in
everything
,
''
*NL*
and
so
he
did
,
sifting
the
barley
for
him
and
cleaning
out
the
manger
;
a
*NL*
degree
of
humility
which
made
the
other
feel
bound
to
tell
him
with
a
*NL*
good
grace
what
he
had
asked
;
so
seating
himself
on
a
bench
,
with
Don
*NL*
Quixote
beside
him
,
and
the
cousin
,
the
page
,
Sancho
Panza
,
and
the
*NL*
landlord
,
for
a
senate
and
an
audience
,
he
began
his
story
in
this
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
know
that
in
a
village
four
leagues
and
a
half
from
this
inn
,
*NL*
it
so
happened
that
one
of
the
regidors
,
by
the
tricks
and
roguery
of
a
*NL*
servant
girl
of
his
-LRB-
it
's
too
long
a
tale
to
tell
-RRB-
,
lost
an
ass
;
and
*NL*
though
he
did
all
he
possibly
could
to
find
it
,
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
.
*NL*
A
fortnight
might
have
gone
by
,
so
the
story
goes
,
since
the
ass
had
been
*NL*
missing
,
when
,
as
the
regidor
who
had
lost
it
was
standing
in
the
plaza
,
*NL*
another
regidor
of
the
same
town
said
to
him
,
`
Pay
me
for
good
news
,
*NL*
gossip
;
your
ass
has
turned
up
.
'
`
That
I
will
,
and
well
,
gossip
,
'
said
*NL*
the
other
;
`
but
tell
us
,
where
has
he
turned
up
?
'
`
In
the
forest
,
'
said
*NL*
the
finder
;
'
I
saw
him
this
morning
without
pack-saddle
or
harness
of
any
*NL*
sort
,
and
so
lean
that
it
went
to
one
's
heart
to
see
him
.
I
tried
to
*NL*
drive
him
before
me
and
bring
him
to
you
,
but
he
is
already
so
wild
and
*NL*
shy
that
when
I
went
near
him
he
made
off
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
*NL*
forest
.
If
you
have
a
mind
that
we
two
should
go
back
and
look
for
him
,
*NL*
let
me
put
up
this
she-ass
at
my
house
and
I
'll
be
back
at
once
.
'
`
You
*NL*
will
be
doing
me
a
great
kindness
,
'
said
the
owner
of
the
ass
,
`
and
I
'll
*NL*
try
to
pay
it
back
in
the
same
coin
.
'
It
is
with
all
these
circumstances
,
*NL*
and
in
the
very
same
way
I
am
telling
it
now
,
that
those
who
know
all
*NL*
about
the
matter
tell
the
story
.
Well
then
,
the
two
regidors
set
off
on
*NL*
foot
,
arm
in
arm
,
for
the
forest
,
and
coming
to
the
place
where
they
*NL*
hoped
to
find
the
ass
they
could
not
find
him
,
nor
was
he
to
be
seen
*NL*
anywhere
about
,
search
as
they
might
.
Seeing
,
then
,
that
there
was
no
*NL*
sign
of
him
,
the
regidor
who
had
seen
him
said
to
the
other
,
`
Look
here
,
*NL*
gossip
;
a
plan
has
occurred
to
me
,
by
which
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
we
shall
*NL*
manage
to
discover
the
animal
,
even
if
he
is
stowed
away
in
the
bowels
of
*NL*
the
earth
,
not
to
say
the
forest
.
Here
it
is
.
I
can
bray
to
perfection
,
*NL*
and
if
you
can
ever
so
little
,
the
thing
's
as
good
as
done
.
'
`
Ever
so
*NL*
little
did
you
say
,
gossip
?
'
said
the
other
;
`
by
God
,
I
'll
not
give
in
to
*NL*
anybody
,
not
even
to
the
asses
themselves
.
'
`
We
'll
soon
see
,
'
said
the
*NL*
second
regidor
,
`
for
my
plan
is
that
you
should
go
one
side
of
the
*NL*
forest
,
and
I
the
other
,
so
as
to
go
all
round
about
it
;
and
every
now
*NL*
and
then
you
will
bray
and
I
will
bray
;
and
it
can
not
be
but
that
the
ass
*NL*
will
hear
us
,
and
answer
us
if
he
is
in
the
forest
.
'
To
which
the
owner
*NL*
of
the
ass
replied
,
`
It
's
an
excellent
plan
,
I
declare
,
gossip
,
and
*NL*
worthy
of
your
great
genius
;
'
and
the
two
separating
as
agreed
,
it
so
*NL*
fell
out
that
they
brayed
almost
at
the
same
moment
,
and
each
,
deceived
*NL*
by
the
braying
of
the
other
,
ran
to
look
,
fancying
the
ass
had
turned
up
*NL*
at
last
.
When
they
came
in
sight
of
one
another
,
said
the
loser
,
`
Is
it
*NL*
possible
,
gossip
,
that
it
was
not
my
ass
that
brayed
?
'
`
No
,
it
was
I
,
'
*NL*
said
the
other
.
`
Well
then
,
I
can
tell
you
,
gossip
,
'
said
the
ass
's
*NL*
owner
,
`
that
between
you
and
an
ass
there
is
not
an
atom
of
difference
as
*NL*
far
as
braying
goes
,
for
I
never
in
all
my
life
saw
or
heard
anything
*NL*
more
natural
.
'
`
Those
praises
and
compliments
belong
to
you
more
justly
*NL*
than
to
me
,
gossip
,
'
said
the
inventor
of
the
plan
;
`
for
,
by
the
God
that
*NL*
made
me
,
you
might
give
a
couple
of
brays
odds
to
the
best
and
most
*NL*
finished
brayer
in
the
world
;
the
tone
you
have
got
is
deep
,
your
voice
*NL*
is
well
kept
up
as
to
time
and
pitch
,
and
your
finishing
notes
come
thick
*NL*
and
fast
;
in
fact
,
I
own
myself
beaten
,
and
yield
the
palm
to
you
,
and
*NL*
give
in
to
you
in
this
rare
accomplishment
.
'
`
Well
then
,
'
said
the
owner
,
*NL*
`
I
'll
set
a
higher
value
on
myself
for
the
future
,
and
consider
that
I
*NL*
know
something
,
as
I
have
an
excellence
of
some
sort
;
for
though
I
always
*NL*
thought
I
brayed
well
,
I
never
supposed
I
came
up
to
the
pitch
of
*NL*
perfection
you
say
.
'
`
And
I
say
too
,
'
said
the
second
,
`
that
there
are
*NL*
rare
gifts
going
to
loss
in
the
world
,
and
that
they
are
ill
bestowed
*NL*
upon
those
who
do
n't
know
how
to
make
use
of
them
.
'
`
Ours
,
'
said
the
*NL*
owner
of
the
ass
,
`
unless
it
is
in
cases
like
this
we
have
now
in
hand
,
*NL*
can
not
be
of
any
service
to
us
,
and
even
in
this
God
grant
they
may
be
of
*NL*
some
use
.
'
So
saying
they
separated
,
and
took
to
their
braying
once
more
,
*NL*
but
every
instant
they
were
deceiving
one
another
,
and
coming
to
meet
one
*NL*
another
again
,
until
they
arranged
by
way
of
countersign
,
so
as
to
know
*NL*
that
it
was
they
and
not
the
ass
,
to
give
two
brays
,
one
after
the
other
.
*NL*
In
this
way
,
doubling
the
brays
at
every
step
,
they
made
the
complete
*NL*
circuit
of
the
forest
,
but
the
lost
ass
never
gave
them
an
answer
or
even
*NL*
the
sign
of
one
.
How
could
the
poor
ill-starred
brute
have
answered
,
*NL*
when
,
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
forest
,
they
found
him
devoured
by
*NL*
wolves
?
As
soon
as
he
saw
him
his
owner
said
,
'
I
was
wondering
he
did
not
*NL*
answer
,
for
if
he
was
n't
dead
he
'd
have
brayed
when
he
heard
us
,
or
he
'd
*NL*
have
been
no
ass
;
but
for
the
sake
of
having
heard
you
bray
to
such
*NL*
perfection
,
gossip
,
I
count
the
trouble
I
have
taken
to
look
for
him
well
*NL*
bestowed
,
even
though
I
have
found
him
dead
.
'
`
It
's
in
a
good
hand
,
*NL*
gossip
,
'
said
the
other
;
`
if
the
abbot
sings
well
,
the
acolyte
is
not
*NL*
much
behind
him
.
'
So
they
returned
disconsolate
and
hoarse
to
their
*NL*
village
,
where
they
told
their
friends
,
neighbours
,
and
acquaintances
*NL*
what
had
befallen
them
in
their
search
for
the
ass
,
each
crying
up
the
*NL*
other
's
perfection
in
braying
.
The
whole
story
came
to
be
known
and
*NL*
spread
abroad
through
the
villages
of
the
neighbourhood
;
and
the
devil
,
*NL*
who
never
sleeps
,
with
his
love
for
sowing
dissensions
and
scattering
*NL*
discord
everywhere
,
blowing
mischief
about
and
making
quarrels
out
of
*NL*
nothing
,
contrived
to
make
the
people
of
the
other
towns
fall
to
braying
*NL*
whenever
they
saw
anyone
from
our
village
,
as
if
to
throw
the
braying
of
*NL*
our
regidors
in
our
teeth
.
Then
the
boys
took
to
it
,
which
was
the
same
*NL*
thing
for
it
as
getting
into
the
hands
and
mouths
of
all
the
devils
of
*NL*
hell
;
and
braying
spread
from
one
town
to
another
in
such
a
way
that
the
*NL*
men
of
the
braying
town
are
as
easy
to
be
known
as
blacks
are
to
be
known
*NL*
from
whites
,
and
the
unlucky
joke
has
gone
so
far
that
several
times
the
*NL*
scoffed
have
come
out
in
arms
and
in
a
body
to
do
battle
with
the
*NL*
scoffers
,
and
neither
king
nor
rook
,
fear
nor
shame
,
can
mend
matters
.
*NL*
To-morrow
or
the
day
after
,
I
believe
,
the
men
of
my
town
,
that
is
,
of
*NL*
the
braying
town
,
are
going
to
take
the
field
against
another
village
two
*NL*
leagues
away
from
ours
,
one
of
those
that
persecute
us
most
;
and
that
we
*NL*
may
turn
out
well
prepared
I
have
bought
these
lances
and
halberds
you
*NL*
have
seen
.
These
are
the
curious
things
I
told
you
I
had
to
tell
,
and
if
*NL*
you
do
n't
think
them
so
,
I
have
got
no
others
;
''
and
with
this
the
worthy
*NL*
fellow
brought
his
story
to
a
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
this
moment
there
came
in
at
the
gate
of
the
inn
a
man
entirely
*NL*
clad
in
chamois
leather
,
hose
,
breeches
,
and
doublet
,
who
said
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
,
``
Senor
host
,
have
you
room
?
Here
's
the
divining
ape
and
the
show
*NL*
of
the
Release
of
Melisendra
just
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ods
body
!
''
said
the
landlord
,
``
why
,
it
's
Master
Pedro
!
We
're
in
for
a
*NL*
grand
night
!
''
I
forgot
to
mention
that
the
said
Master
Pedro
had
his
left
*NL*
eye
and
nearly
half
his
cheek
covered
with
a
patch
of
green
taffety
,
*NL*
showing
that
something
ailed
all
that
side
.
``
Your
worship
is
welcome
,
*NL*
Master
Pedro
,
''
continued
the
landlord
;
``
but
where
are
the
ape
and
the
*NL*
show
,
for
I
do
n't
see
them
?
''
``
They
are
close
at
hand
,
''
said
he
in
the
*NL*
chamois
leather
,
``
but
I
came
on
first
to
know
if
there
was
any
room
.
''
*NL*
``
I
'd
make
the
Duke
of
Alva
himself
clear
out
to
make
room
for
Master
*NL*
Pedro
,
''
said
the
landlord
;
``
bring
in
the
ape
and
the
show
;
there
's
*NL*
company
in
the
inn
to-night
that
will
pay
to
see
that
and
the
cleverness
*NL*
of
the
ape
.
''
``
So
be
it
by
all
means
,
''
said
the
man
with
the
patch
;
``
I
'll
*NL*
lower
the
price
,
and
be
well
satisfied
if
I
only
pay
my
expenses
;
and
now
*NL*
I
'll
go
back
and
hurry
on
the
cart
with
the
ape
and
the
show
;
''
and
with
*NL*
this
he
went
out
of
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
at
once
asked
the
landlord
what
this
Master
Pedro
was
,
and
*NL*
what
was
the
show
and
what
was
the
ape
he
had
with
him
;
which
the
*NL*
landlord
replied
,
``
This
is
a
famous
puppet-showman
,
who
for
some
time
*NL*
past
has
been
going
about
this
Mancha
de
Aragon
,
exhibiting
a
show
of
the
*NL*
release
of
Melisendra
by
the
famous
Don
Gaiferos
,
one
of
the
best
and
*NL*
best-represented
stories
that
have
been
seen
in
this
part
of
the
kingdom
*NL*
for
many
a
year
;
he
has
also
with
him
an
ape
with
the
most
extraordinary
*NL*
gift
ever
seen
in
an
ape
or
imagined
in
a
human
being
;
for
if
you
ask
him
*NL*
anything
,
he
listens
attentively
to
the
question
,
and
then
jumps
on
his
*NL*
master
's
shoulder
,
and
pressing
close
to
his
ear
tells
him
the
answer
*NL*
which
Master
Pedro
then
delivers
.
He
says
a
great
deal
more
about
things
*NL*
past
than
about
things
to
come
;
and
though
he
does
not
always
hit
the
*NL*
truth
in
every
case
,
most
times
he
is
not
far
wrong
,
so
that
he
makes
us
*NL*
fancy
he
has
got
the
devil
in
him
.
He
gets
two
reals
for
every
question
*NL*
if
the
ape
answers
;
I
mean
if
his
master
answers
for
him
after
he
has
*NL*
whispered
into
his
ear
;
and
so
it
is
believed
that
this
same
Master
Pedro
*NL*
is
very
rich
.
He
is
a
`
gallant
man
'
as
they
say
in
Italy
,
and
good
*NL*
company
,
and
leads
the
finest
life
in
the
world
;
talks
more
than
six
,
*NL*
drinks
more
than
a
dozen
,
and
all
by
his
tongue
,
and
his
ape
,
and
his
*NL*
show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Pedro
now
came
back
,
and
in
a
cart
followed
the
show
and
the
*NL*
ape
--
a
big
one
,
without
a
tail
and
with
buttocks
as
bare
as
felt
,
but
not
*NL*
vicious-looking
.
As
soon
as
Don
Quixote
saw
him
,
he
asked
him
,
``
Can
you
*NL*
tell
me
,
sir
fortune-teller
,
what
fish
do
we
catch
,
and
how
will
it
be
*NL*
with
us
?
See
,
here
are
my
two
reals
,
''
and
he
bade
Sancho
give
them
to
*NL*
Master
Pedro
;
but
he
answered
for
the
ape
and
said
,
``
Senor
,
this
animal
*NL*
does
not
give
any
answer
or
information
touching
things
that
are
to
come
;
*NL*
of
things
past
he
knows
something
,
and
more
or
less
of
things
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gad
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
would
not
give
a
farthing
to
be
told
what
's
past
*NL*
with
me
,
for
who
knows
that
better
than
I
do
myself
?
And
to
pay
for
being
*NL*
told
what
I
know
would
be
mighty
foolish
.
But
as
you
know
things
present
,
*NL*
here
are
my
two
reals
,
and
tell
me
,
most
excellent
sir
ape
,
what
is
my
*NL*
wife
Teresa
Panza
doing
now
,
and
what
is
she
diverting
herself
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Pedro
refused
to
take
the
money
,
saying
,
``
I
will
not
receive
*NL*
payment
in
advance
or
until
the
service
has
been
first
rendered
;
''
and
*NL*
then
with
his
right
hand
he
gave
a
couple
of
slaps
on
his
left
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
with
one
spring
the
ape
perched
himself
upon
it
,
and
putting
his
*NL*
mouth
to
his
master
's
ear
began
chattering
his
teeth
rapidly
;
and
having
*NL*
kept
this
up
as
long
as
one
would
be
saying
a
credo
,
with
another
spring
*NL*
he
brought
himself
to
the
ground
,
and
the
same
instant
Master
Pedro
ran
*NL*
in
great
haste
and
fell
upon
his
knees
before
Don
Quixote
,
and
embracing
*NL*
his
legs
exclaimed
,
``
These
legs
do
I
embrace
as
I
would
embrace
the
two
*NL*
pillars
of
Hercules
,
O
illustrious
reviver
of
knight-errantry
,
so
long
*NL*
consigned
to
oblivion
!
O
never
yet
duly
extolled
knight
,
Don
Quixote
of
*NL*
La
Mancha
,
courage
of
the
faint-hearted
,
prop
of
the
tottering
,
arm
of
*NL*
the

*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
thunderstruck
,
Sancho
astounded
,
the
cousin
staggered
,
*NL*
the
page
astonished
,
the
man
from
the
braying
town
agape
,
the
landlord
in
*NL*
perplexity
,
and
,
in
short
,
everyone
amazed
at
the
words
of
the
*NL*
puppet-showman
,
who
went
on
to
say
,
``
And
thou
,
worthy
Sancho
Panza
,
the
*NL*
best
squire
and
squire
to
the
best
knight
in

!
Be
of
good
cheer
,
*NL*
for
thy
good
wife
Teresa
is
well
,
and
she
is
at
this
moment
hackling
a
*NL*
pound
of
flax
;
and
more
by
token
she
has
at
her
left
hand
a
jug
with
a
*NL*
broken
spout
that
holds
a
good
drop
of
wine
,
with
which
she
solaces
*NL*
herself
at
her
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
well
believe
,
''
said
Sancho
.
``
She
is
a
lucky
one
,
and
if
it
*NL*
was
not
for
her
jealousy
I
would
not
change
her
for
the
giantess
*NL*
Andandona
,
who
by
my
master
's
account
was
a
very
clever
and
worthy
woman
;
*NL*
my
Teresa
is
one
of
those
that
wo
n't
let
themselves
want
for
anything
,
*NL*
though
their
heirs
may
have
to
pay
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
declare
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
he
who
reads
much
and
travels
much
*NL*
sees
and
knows
a
great
deal
.
I
say
so
because
what
amount
of
persuasion
*NL*
could
have
persuaded
me
that
there
are
apes
in
the
world
that
can
divine
*NL*
as
I
have
seen
now
with
my
own
eyes
?
For
I
am
that
very
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
this
worthy
animal
refers
to
,
though
he
has
gone
rather
too
far
in
*NL*
my
praise
;
but
whatever
I
may
be
,
I
thank
heaven
that
it
has
endowed
me
*NL*
with
a
tender
and
compassionate
heart
,
always
disposed
to
do
good
to
all
*NL*
and
harm
to
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
money
,
''
said
the
page
,
``
I
would
ask
senor
ape
what
will
happen
*NL*
to
me
in
the
peregrination
I
am
making
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Master
Pedro
,
who
had
by
this
time
risen
from
Don
Quixote
's
feet
,
*NL*
replied
,
``
I
have
already
said
that
this
little
beast
gives
no
answer
as
*NL*
to
the
future
;
but
if
he
did
,
not
having
money
would
be
of
no
*NL*
consequence
,
for
to
oblige
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
here
present
,
I
would
give
*NL*
up
all
the
profits
in
the
world
.
And
now
,
because
I
have
promised
it
,
and
*NL*
to
afford
him
pleasure
,
I
will
set
up
my
show
and
offer
entertainment
to
*NL*
all
who
are
in
the
inn
,
without
any
charge
whatever
.
''
As
soon
as
he
heard
*NL*
this
,
the
landlord
,
delighted
beyond
measure
,
pointed
out
a
place
where
*NL*
the
show
might
be
fixed
,
which
was
done
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
not
very
well
satisfied
with
the
divinations
of
the
ape
,
*NL*
as
he
did
not
think
it
proper
that
an
ape
should
divine
anything
,
either
*NL*
past
or
future
;
so
while
Master
Pedro
was
arranging
the
show
,
he
retired
*NL*
with
Sancho
into
a
corner
of
the
stable
,
where
,
without
being
overheard
*NL*
by
anyone
,
he
said
to
him
,
``
Look
here
,
Sancho
,
I
have
been
seriously
*NL*
thinking
over
this
ape
's
extraordinary
gift
,
and
have
come
to
the
*NL*
conclusion
that
beyond
doubt
this
Master
Pedro
,
his
master
,
has
a
pact
,
*NL*
tacit
or
express
,
with
the
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
packet
is
express
from
the
devil
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
it
must
be
a
*NL*
very
dirty
packet
no
doubt
;
but
what
good
can
it
do
Master
Pedro
to
have
*NL*
such
packets
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
dost
not
understand
me
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
I
only
mean
he
*NL*
must
have
made
some
compact
with
the
devil
to
infuse
this
power
into
the
*NL*
ape
,
that
he
may
get
his
living
,
and
after
he
has
grown
rich
he
will
give
*NL*
him
his
soul
,
which
is
what
the
enemy
of
mankind
wants
;
this
I
am
led
to
*NL*
believe
by
observing
that
the
ape
only
answers
about
things
past
or
*NL*
present
,
and
the
devil
's
knowledge
extends
no
further
;
for
the
future
he
*NL*
knows
only
by
guesswork
,
and
that
not
always
;
for
it
is
reserved
for
God
*NL*
alone
to
know
the
times
and
the
seasons
,
and
for
him
there
is
neither
*NL*
past
nor
future
;
all
is
present
.
This
being
as
it
is
,
it
is
clear
that
*NL*
this
ape
speaks
by
the
spirit
of
the
devil
;
and
I
am
astonished
they
have
*NL*
not
denounced
him
to
the
Holy
Office
,
and
put
him
to
the
question
,
and
*NL*
forced
it
out
of
him
by
whose
virtue
it
is
that
he
divines
;
because
it
is
*NL*
certain
this
ape
is
not
an
astrologer
;
neither
his
master
nor
he
sets
up
,
*NL*
or
knows
how
to
set
up
,
those
figures
they
call
judiciary
,
which
are
now
*NL*
so
common
in
Spain
that
there
is
not
a
jade
,
or
page
,
or
old
cobbler
,
*NL*
that
will
not
undertake
to
set
up
a
figure
as
readily
as
pick
up
a
knave
*NL*
of
cards
from
the
ground
,
bringing
to
nought
the
marvellous
truth
of
the
*NL*
science
by
their
lies
and
ignorance
.
I
know
of
a
lady
who
asked
one
of
*NL*
these
figure
schemers
whether
her
little
lap-dog
would
be
in
pup
and
*NL*
would
breed
,
and
how
many
and
of
what
colour
the
little
pups
would
be
.
To
*NL*
which
senor
astrologer
,
after
having
set
up
his
figure
,
made
answer
that
*NL*
the
bitch
would
be
in
pup
,
and
would
drop
three
pups
,
one
green
,
another
*NL*
bright
red
,
and
the
third
parti-coloured
,
provided
she
conceived
between
*NL*
eleven
and
twelve
either
of
the
day
or
night
,
and
on
a
Monday
or
*NL*
Saturday
;
but
as
things
turned
out
,
two
days
after
this
the
bitch
died
of
*NL*
a
surfeit
,
and
senor
planet-ruler
had
the
credit
all
over
the
place
of
*NL*
being
a
most
profound
astrologer
,
as
most
of
these
planet-rulers
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
would
be
glad
if
your
worship
would
make
Master
*NL*
Pedro
ask
his
ape
whether
what
happened
your
worship
in
the
cave
of
*NL*
Montesinos
is
true
;
for
,
begging
your
worship
's
pardon
,
I
,
for
my
part
,
*NL*
take
it
to
have
been
all
flam
and
lies
,
or
at
any
rate
something
you
*NL*
dreamt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
however
,
I
will
do
what
you
suggest
;
*NL*
though
I
have
my
own
scruples
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
Master
Pedro
came
up
in
quest
of
Don
Quixote
,
to
tell
him
*NL*
the
show
was
now
ready
and
to
come
and
see
it
,
for
it
was
worth
seeing
.
*NL*
Don
Quixote
explained
his
wish
,
and
begged
him
to
ask
his
ape
at
once
to
*NL*
tell
him
whether
certain
things
which
had
happened
to
him
in
the
cave
of
*NL*
Montesinos
were
dreams
or
realities
,
for
to
him
they
appeared
to
partake
*NL*
of
both
.
Upon
this
Master
Pedro
,
without
answering
,
went
back
to
fetch
*NL*
the
ape
,
and
,
having
placed
it
in
front
of
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
,
said
:
*NL*
``
See
here
,
senor
ape
,
this
gentleman
wishes
to
know
whether
certain
*NL*
things
which
happened
to
him
in
the
cave
called
the
cave
of
Montesinos
*NL*
were
false
or
true
.
''
On
his
making
the
usual
sign
the
ape
mounted
on
his
*NL*
left
shoulder
and
seemed
to
whisper
in
his
ear
,
and
Master
Pedro
said
at
*NL*
once
,
``
The
ape
says
that
the
things
you
saw
or
that
happened
to
you
in
*NL*
that
cave
are
,
part
of
them
false
,
part
true
;
and
that
he
only
knows
this
*NL*
and
no
more
as
regards
this
question
;
but
if
your
worship
wishes
to
know
*NL*
more
,
on
Friday
next
he
will
answer
all
that
may
be
asked
him
,
for
his
*NL*
virtue
is
at
present
exhausted
,
and
will
not
return
to
him
till
Friday
,
*NL*
as
he
has
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
not
say
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
*NL*
believe
that
all
your
worship
said
about
the
adventures
in
the
cave
was
*NL*
true
,
or
even
the
half
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
course
of
events
will
tell
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
time
,
*NL*
that
discloses
all
things
,
leaves
nothing
that
it
does
not
drag
into
the
*NL*
light
of
day
,
though
it
be
buried
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
.
But
enough
*NL*
of
that
for
the
present
;
let
us
go
and
see
Master
Pedro
's
show
,
for
I
am
*NL*
sure
there
must
be
something
novel
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
!
''
said
Master
Pedro
;
``
this
show
of
mine
has
sixty
thousand
*NL*
novel
things
in
it
;
let
me
tell
you
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
it
is
one
of
the
*NL*
best-worth-seeing
things
in
the
world
this
day
;
but
operibus
credite
et
*NL*
non
verbis
,
and
now
let
's
get
to
work
,
for
it
is
growing
late
,
and
we
*NL*
have
a
great
deal
to
do
and
to
say
and
show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
obeyed
him
and
went
to
where
the
show
was
already
*NL*
put
up
and
uncovered
,
set
all
around
with
lighted
wax
tapers
which
made
*NL*
it
look
splendid
and
bright
.
When
they
came
to
it
Master
Pedro
ensconced
*NL*
himself
inside
it
,
for
it
was
he
who
had
to
work
the
puppets
,
and
a
boy
,
*NL*
a
servant
of
his
,
posted
himself
outside
to
act
as
showman
and
explain
*NL*
the
mysteries
of
the
exhibition
,
having
a
wand
in
his
hand
to
point
to
*NL*
the
figures
as
they
came
out
.
And
so
,
all
who
were
in
the
inn
being
*NL*
arranged
in
front
of
the
show
,
some
of
them
standing
,
and
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
the
page
,
and
cousin
,
accommodated
with
the
best
places
,
the
*NL*
interpreter
began
to
say
what
he
will
hear
or
see
who
reads
or
hears
the
*NL*
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
CONTINUED
THE
DROLL
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
PUPPET-SHOWMAN
,
TOGETHER
*NL*
WITH
OTHER
THINGS
IN
TRUTH
RIGHT
GOOD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
silent
,
Tyrians
and
Trojans
;
I
mean
all
who
were
watching
the
*NL*
show
were
hanging
on
the
lips
of
the
interpreter
of
its
wonders
,
when
*NL*
drums
and
trumpets
were
heard
to
sound
inside
it
and
cannon
to
go
off
.
*NL*
The
noise
was
soon
over
,
and
then
the
boy
lifted
up
his
voice
and
said
,
*NL*
``
This
true
story
which
is
here
represented
to
your
worships
is
taken
word
*NL*
for
word
from
the
French
chronicles
and
from
the
Spanish
ballads
that
are
*NL*
in
everybody
's
mouth
,
and
in
the
mouth
of
the
boys
about
the
streets
.
Its
*NL*
subject
is
the
release
by
Senor
Don
Gaiferos
of
his
wife
Melisendra
,
when
*NL*
a
captive
in
Spain
at
the
hands
of
the
Moors
in
the
city
of
Sansuena
,
for
*NL*
so
they
called
then
what
is
now
called
Saragossa
;
and
there
you
may
see
*NL*
how
Don
Gaiferos
is
playing
at
the
tables
,
just
as
they
sing
it
--
*NL*
*NL*
At
tables
playing
Don
Gaiferos
sits
,
*NL*
For
Melisendra
is
forgotten
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
personage
who
appears
there
with
a
crown
on
his
head
and
a
*NL*
sceptre
in
his
hand
is
the
Emperor
Charlemagne
,
the
supposed
father
of
*NL*
Melisendra
,
who
,
angered
to
see
his
son-in-law
's
inaction
and
unconcern
,
*NL*
comes
in
to
chide
him
;
and
observe
with
what
vehemence
and
energy
he
*NL*
chides
him
,
so
that
you
would
fancy
he
was
going
to
give
him
half
a
dozen
*NL*
raps
with
his
sceptre
;
and
indeed
there
are
authors
who
say
he
did
give
*NL*
them
,
and
sound
ones
too
;
and
after
having
said
a
great
deal
to
him
about
*NL*
imperilling
his
honour
by
not
effecting
the
release
of
his
wife
,
he
said
,
*NL*
so
the
tale
runs
,
*NL*
*NL*
Enough
I
've
said
,
see
to
it
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Observe
,
too
,
how
the
emperor
turns
away
,
and
leaves
Don
Gaiferos
fuming
;
*NL*
and
you
see
now
how
in
a
burst
of
anger
,
he
flings
the
table
and
the
*NL*
board
far
from
him
and
calls
in
haste
for
his
armour
,
and
asks
his
cousin
*NL*
Don
Roland
for
the
loan
of
his
sword
,
Durindana
,
and
how
Don
Roland
*NL*
refuses
to
lend
it
,
offering
him
his
company
in
the
difficult
enterprise
*NL*
he
is
undertaking
;
but
he
,
in
his
valour
and
anger
,
will
not
accept
it
,
*NL*
and
says
that
he
alone
will
suffice
to
rescue
his
wife
,
even
though
she
*NL*
were
imprisoned
deep
in
the
centre
of
the
earth
,
and
with
this
he
retires
*NL*
to
arm
himself
and
set
out
on
his
journey
at
once
.
Now
let
your
worships
*NL*
turn
your
eyes
to
that
tower
that
appears
there
,
which
is
supposed
to
be
*NL*
one
of
the
towers
of
the
alcazar
of
Saragossa
,
now
called
the
Aljaferia
;
*NL*
that
lady
who
appears
on
that
balcony
dressed
in
Moorish
fashion
is
the
*NL*
peerless
Melisendra
,
for
many
a
time
she
used
to
gaze
from
thence
upon
*NL*
the
road
to
France
,
and
seek
consolation
in
her
captivity
by
thinking
of
*NL*
Paris
and
her
husband
.
Observe
,
too
,
a
new
incident
which
now
occurs
,
*NL*
such
as
,
perhaps
,
never
was
seen
.
Do
you
not
see
that
Moor
,
who
silently
*NL*
and
stealthily
,
with
his
finger
on
his
lip
,
approaches
Melisendra
from
*NL*
behind
?
Observe
now
how
he
prints
a
kiss
upon
her
lips
,
and
what
a
hurry
*NL*
she
is
in
to
spit
,
and
wipe
them
with
the
white
sleeve
of
her
smock
,
and
*NL*
how
she
bewails
herself
,
and
tears
her
fair
hair
as
though
it
were
to
*NL*
blame
for
the
wrong
.
Observe
,
too
,
that
the
stately
Moor
who
is
in
that
*NL*
corridor
is
King
Marsilio
of
Sansuena
,
who
,
having
seen
the
Moor
's
*NL*
insolence
,
at
once
orders
him
-LRB-
though
his
kinsman
and
a
great
favourite
*NL*
of
his
-RRB-
to
be
seized
and
given
two
hundred
lashes
,
while
carried
through
*NL*
the
streets
of
the
city
according
to
custom
,
with
criers
going
before
him
*NL*
and
officers
of
justice
behind
;
and
here
you
see
them
come
out
to
execute
*NL*
the
sentence
,
although
the
offence
has
been
scarcely
committed
;
for
among
*NL*
the
Moors
there
are
no
indictments
nor
remands
as
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Don
Quixote
called
out
,
``
Child
,
child
,
go
straight
on
with
your
*NL*
story
,
and
do
n't
run
into
curves
and
slants
,
for
to
establish
a
fact
*NL*
clearly
there
is
need
of
a
great
deal
of
proof
and
confirmation
;
''
and
*NL*
said
Master
Pedro
from
within
,
``
Boy
,
stick
to
your
text
and
do
as
the
*NL*
gentleman
bids
you
;
it
's
the
best
plan
;
keep
to
your
plain
song
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
attempt
harmonies
,
for
they
are
apt
to
break
down
from
being
over
*NL*
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
the
boy
,
and
he
went
on
to
say
,
``
This
figure
that
you
see
*NL*
here
on
horseback
,
covered
with
a
Gascon
cloak
,
is
Don
Gaiferos
himself
,
*NL*
whom
his
wife
,
now
avenged
of
the
insult
of
the
amorous
Moor
,
and
taking
*NL*
her
stand
on
the
balcony
of
the
tower
with
a
calmer
and
more
tranquil
*NL*
countenance
,
has
perceived
without
recognising
him
;
and
she
addresses
her
*NL*
husband
,
supposing
him
to
be
some
traveller
,
and
holds
with
him
all
that
*NL*
conversation
and
colloquy
in
the
ballad
that
runs
--
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
,
sir
knight
,
to
France
are
bound
,
*NL*
Oh
!
for
Gaiferos
ask
--
*NL*
*NL*
which
I
do
not
repeat
here
because
prolixity
begets
disgust
;
suffice
it
*NL*
to
observe
how
Don
Gaiferos
discovers
himself
,
and
that
by
her
joyful
*NL*
gestures
Melisendra
shows
us
she
has
recognised
him
;
and
what
is
more
,
we
*NL*
now
see
she
lowers
herself
from
the
balcony
to
place
herself
on
the
*NL*
haunches
of
her
good
husband
's
horse
.
But
ah
!
unhappy
lady
,
the
edge
of
*NL*
her
petticoat
has
caught
on
one
of
the
bars
of
the
balcony
and
she
is
*NL*
left
hanging
in
the
air
,
unable
to
reach
the
ground
.
But
you
see
how
*NL*
compassionate
heaven
sends
aid
in
our
sorest
need
;
Don
Gaiferos
advances
,
*NL*
and
without
minding
whether
the
rich
petticoat
is
torn
or
not
,
he
seizes
*NL*
her
and
by
force
brings
her
to
the
ground
,
and
then
with
one
jerk
places
*NL*
her
on
the
haunches
of
his
horse
,
astraddle
like
a
man
,
and
bids
her
hold
*NL*
on
tight
and
clasp
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
crossing
them
on
his
breast
*NL*
so
as
not
to
fall
,
for
the
lady
Melisendra
was
not
used
to
that
style
of
*NL*
riding
.
You
see
,
too
,
how
the
neighing
of
the
horse
shows
his
*NL*
satisfaction
with
the
gallant
and
beautiful
burden
he
bears
in
his
lord
*NL*
and
lady
.
You
see
how
they
wheel
round
and
quit
the
city
,
and
in
joy
and
*NL*
gladness
take
the
road
to
Paris
.
Go
in
peace
,
O
peerless
pair
of
true
*NL*
lovers
!
May
you
reach
your
longed-for
fatherland
in
safety
,
and
may
*NL*
fortune
interpose
no
impediment
to
your
prosperous
journey
;
may
the
eyes
*NL*
of
your
friends
and
kinsmen
behold
you
enjoying
in
peace
and
tranquillity
*NL*
the
remaining
days
of
your
life
--
and
that
they
may
be
as
many
as
those
of
*NL*
Nestor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Master
Pedro
called
out
again
and
said
,
``
Simplicity
,
boy
!
None
of
*NL*
your
high
flights
;
all
affectation
is
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
interpreter
made
no
answer
,
but
went
on
to
say
,
``
There
was
no
want
of
*NL*
idle
eyes
,
that
see
everything
,
to
see
Melisendra
come
down
and
mount
,
*NL*
and
word
was
brought
to
King
Marsilio
,
who
at
once
gave
orders
to
sound
*NL*
the
alarm
;
and
see
what
a
stir
there
is
,
and
how
the
city
is
drowned
with
*NL*
the
sound
of
the
bells
pealing
in
the
towers
of
all
the
mosques
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
;
``
on
that
point
of
the
bells
Master
*NL*
Pedro
is
very
inaccurate
,
for
bells
are
not
in
use
among
the
Moors
;
only
*NL*
kettledrums
,
and
a
kind
of
small
trumpet
somewhat
like
our
clarion
;
to
*NL*
ring
bells
this
way
in
Sansuena
is
unquestionably
a
great
absurdity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
,
Master
Pedro
stopped
ringing
,
and
said
,
``
Do
n't
look
into
*NL*
trifles
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
or
want
to
have
things
up
to
a
pitch
of
*NL*
perfection
that
is
out
of
reach
.
Are
there
not
almost
every
day
a
*NL*
thousand
comedies
represented
all
round
us
full
of
thousands
of
*NL*
inaccuracies
and
absurdities
,
and
,
for
all
that
,
they
have
a
successful
*NL*
run
,
and
are
listened
to
not
only
with
applause
,
but
with
admiration
and
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
it
?
Go
on
,
boy
,
and
do
n't
mind
;
for
so
long
as
I
fill
my
*NL*
pouch
,
no
matter
if
I
show
as
many
inaccuracies
as
there
are
motes
in
a
*NL*
sunbeam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
enough
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
and
the
boy
went
on
:
``
See
what
a
*NL*
numerous
and
glittering
crowd
of
horsemen
issues
from
the
city
in
pursuit
*NL*
of
the
two
faithful
lovers
,
what
a
blowing
of
trumpets
there
is
,
what
*NL*
sounding
of
horns
,
what
beating
of
drums
and
tabors
;
I
fear
me
they
will
*NL*
overtake
them
and
bring
them
back
tied
to
the
tail
of
their
own
horse
,
*NL*
which
would
be
a
dreadful
sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
however
,
seeing
such
a
swarm
of
Moors
and
hearing
such
a
*NL*
din
,
thought
it
would
be
right
to
aid
the
fugitives
,
and
standing
up
he
*NL*
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
,
``
Never
,
while
I
live
,
will
I
permit
foul
play
*NL*
to
be
practised
in
my
presence
on
such
a
famous
knight
and
fearless
lover
*NL*
as
Don
Gaiferos
.
Halt
!
ill-born
rabble
,
follow
him
not
nor
pursue
him
,
or
*NL*
ye
will
have
to
reckon
with
me
in
battle
!
''
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
*NL*
word
,
he
drew
his
sword
,
and
with
one
bound
placed
himself
close
to
the
*NL*
show
,
and
with
unexampled
rapidity
and
fury
began
to
shower
down
blows
on
*NL*
the
puppet
troop
of
Moors
,
knocking
over
some
,
decapitating
others
,
*NL*
maiming
this
one
and
demolishing
that
;
and
among
many
more
he
delivered
*NL*
one
down
stroke
which
,
if
Master
Pedro
had
not
ducked
,
made
himself
*NL*
small
,
and
got
out
of
the
way
,
would
have
sliced
off
his
head
as
easily
*NL*
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
almond-paste
.
Master
Pedro
kept
shouting
,
``
Hold
*NL*
hard
!
Senor
Don
Quixote
!
ca
n't
you
see
they
're
not
real
Moors
you
're
*NL*
knocking
down
and
killing
and
destroying
,
but
only
little
pasteboard
*NL*
figures
!
Look
--
sinner
that
I
am
!
--
how
you
're
wrecking
and
ruining
all
*NL*
that
I
'm
worth
!
''
But
in
spite
of
this
,
Don
Quixote
did
not
leave
off
*NL*
discharging
a
continuous
rain
of
cuts
,
slashes
,
downstrokes
,
and
*NL*
backstrokes
,
and
at
length
,
in
less
than
the
space
of
two
credos
,
he
*NL*
brought
the
whole
show
to
the
ground
,
with
all
its
fittings
and
figures
*NL*
shivered
and
knocked
to
pieces
,
King
Marsilio
badly
wounded
,
and
the
*NL*
Emperor
Charlemagne
with
his
crown
and
head
split
in
two
.
The
whole
*NL*
audience
was
thrown
into
confusion
,
the
ape
fled
to
the
roof
of
the
inn
,
*NL*
the
cousin
was
frightened
,
and
even
Sancho
Panza
himself
was
in
mighty
*NL*
fear
,
for
,
as
he
swore
after
the
storm
was
over
,
he
had
never
seen
his
*NL*
master
in
such
a
furious
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
complete
destruction
of
the
show
being
thus
accomplished
,
Don
Quixote
*NL*
became
a
little
calmer
,
said
,
``
I
wish
I
had
here
before
me
now
all
those
*NL*
who
do
not
or
will
not
believe
how
useful
knights-errant
are
in
the
*NL*
world
;
just
think
,
if
I
had
not
been
here
present
,
what
would
have
become
*NL*
of
the
brave
Don
Gaiferos
and
the
fair
Melisendra
!
Depend
upon
it
,
by
*NL*
this
time
those
dogs
would
have
overtaken
them
and
inflicted
some
outrage
*NL*
upon
them

So

then

long
live
knight-errantry
beyond
everything
living
*NL*
on
earth
this
day

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
live

at
this
in
a
feeble
voice
,

``

Sancho

was
touched

said
to

returned
Master

;

these

scattered

strength
of

mighty
arm

And
whose
were
the
bodies

belonged
to

And
what
did
I
get
my
living
by

by
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
am
I
fully
convinced

''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
of
what
I
had
many
a
time
*NL*
before
believed

that
the
enchanters
who
persecute
me
do
nothing
more
*NL*
than
put
figures
like
these
before
my
eyes
,
and
then
change
and
turn
them
*NL*
into
what
they
please
.
In
truth
and
earnest
,
I
assure
you
gentlemen
who
*NL*
now
hear
me
,
that
to
me
everything
that
has
taken
place
here
seemed
to
*NL*
take
place
literally
,
that
Melisendra
was
Melisendra
,
Don
Gaiferos
Don
*NL*
Gaiferos
,
Marsilio
Marsilio

Charlemagne
Charlemagne

That
was
why
my
*NL*
anger
was
roused
;
and
to
be
faithful
to
my
calling
as
a
knight-errant
I
*NL*
sought
to
give
aid
and
protection
to
those
who
fled
,
and
with
this
good
*NL*
intention
I
did
what
you
have
seen

If
the
result
has
been
the
opposite
*NL*
of
what
I
intended

it
is
no
fault
of
mine

but
of
those
wicked
beings
*NL*
that
persecute
me
;
but
,
for
all
that
,
I
am
willing
to
condemn
myself
in
*NL*
costs
for
this
error
of
mine
,
though
it
did
not
proceed
from
malice
;
let
*NL*
Master
Pedro
see
what
he
wants
for
the
spoiled
figures

for
I
agree
to
*NL*
pay
it
at
once
in
good
and
current
money
of
Castile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Pedro
made
him
a
bow
,
saying
,
``
I
expected
no
less
of
the
rare

valiant
Don

*NL*
protector
of
all
destitute

master

here

great
Sancho

what
these
dilapidated
figures
are
worth

may
be
*NL*
worth

*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
and
Sancho
consented

then
Master
Pedro
picked
up
from
*NL*
the
ground
King
Marsilio
of
Saragossa
with
his
head
off

said
,
``
Here

saving
your
better
judgments
,
that
for
his
death
,
decease
,
and
*NL*
demise
,
four
reals
and
a
half
may
be
given
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
for
this
cleavage
from
top
to
bottom
,
''
continued
Master
*NL*
Pedro
,
taking
up
the
split
Emperor
Charlemagne
,
``
it
would
not
be
much
if
*NL*
I
were
to
ask
five
reals
and
a
quarter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
little
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
is
it
much
,
''
said
the
landlord
;
``
make
it
even
,
and
say
five
reals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
have
the
whole
five
and
a
quarter
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
the
*NL*
sum
total
of
this
notable
disaster
does
not
stand
on
a
quarter
more
or
*NL*
less
;
and
make
an
end
of
it
quickly
,
Master
Pedro
,
for
it
's
getting
on
to
*NL*
supper-time
,
and
I
have
some
hints
of
hunger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
this
figure
,
''
said
Master
Pedro
,
``
that
is
without
a
nose
,
and
wants
*NL*
an
eye
,
and
is
the
fair
Melisendra
,
I
ask
,
and
I
am
reasonable
in
my
*NL*
charge
,
two
reals
and
twelve
maravedis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
devil
must
be
in
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
Melisendra
and
her
*NL*
husband
are
not
by
this
time
at
least
on
the
French
border
,
for
the
horse
*NL*
they
rode
on
seemed
to
me
to
fly
rather
than
gallop
;
so
you
need
n't
try
*NL*
to
sell
me
the
cat
for
the
hare
,
showing
me
here
a
noseless
Melisendra
*NL*
when
she
is
now
,
may
be
,
enjoying
herself
at
her
ease
with
her
husband
in
*NL*
France
.
God
help
every
one
to
his
own
,
Master
Pedro
,
and
let
us
all
*NL*
proceed
fairly
and
honestly
;
and
now
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Pedro
,
perceiving
that
Don
Quixote
was
beginning
to
wander
,
and
*NL*
return
to
his
original
fancy
,
was
not
disposed
to
let
him
escape
,
so
he
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
This
can
not
be
Melisendra
,
but
must
be
one
of
the
damsels
*NL*
that
waited
on
her
;
so
if
I
'm
given
sixty
maravedis
for
her
,
I
'll
be
*NL*
content
and
sufficiently
paid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
went
on
,
putting
values
on
ever
so
many
more
smashed
figures
,
*NL*
which
,
after
the
two
arbitrators
had
adjusted
them
to
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
both
parties
,
came
to
forty
reals
and
three-quarters
;
and
over
and
above
*NL*
this
sum
,
which
Sancho
at
once
disbursed
,
Master
Pedro
asked
for
two
*NL*
reals
for
his
trouble
in
catching
the
ape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
have
them
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
not
to
catch
the
ape
,
but
*NL*
to
get
drunk
;
and
two
hundred
would
I
give
this
minute
for
the
good
news
,
*NL*
to
anyone
who
could
tell
me
positively
,
that
the
lady
Dona
Melisandra
and
*NL*
Senor
Don
Gaiferos
were
now
in
France
and
with
their
own
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
could
tell
us
that
better
than
my
ape
,
''
said
Master
Pedro
;
``
but
*NL*
there
's
no
devil
that
could
catch
him
now
;
I
suspect
,
however
,
that
*NL*
affection
and
hunger
will
drive
him
to
come
looking
for
me
to-night
;
but
*NL*
to-morrow
will
soon
be
here
and
we
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
the
puppet-show
storm
passed
off
,
and
all
supped
in
peace
and
*NL*
good
fellowship
at
Don
Quixote
's
expense
,
for
he
was
the
height
of
*NL*
generosity
.
Before
it
was
daylight
the
man
with
the
lances
and
halberds
*NL*
took
his
departure
,
and
soon
after
daybreak
the
cousin
and
the
page
came
*NL*
to
bid
Don
Quixote
farewell
,
the
former
returning
home
,
the
latter
*NL*
resuming
his
journey
,
towards
which
,
to
help
him
,
Don
Quixote
gave
him
*NL*
twelve
reals
.
Master
Pedro
did
not
care
to
engage
in
any
more
palaver
*NL*
with
Don
Quixote
,
whom
he
knew
right
well
;
so
he
rose
before
the
sun
,
and
*NL*
having
got
together
the
remains
of
his
show
and
caught
his
ape
,
he
too
*NL*
went
off
to
seek
his
adventures
.
The
landlord
,
who
did
not
know
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
was
as
much
astonished
at
his
mad
freaks
as
at
his
generosity
.
*NL*
To
conclude
,
Sancho
,
by
his
master
's
orders
,
paid
him
very
liberally
,
and
*NL*
taking
leave
of
him
they
quitted
the
inn
at
about
eight
in
the
morning
*NL*
and
took
to
the
road
,
where
we
will
leave
them
to
pursue
their
journey
,
*NL*
for
this
is
necessary
in
order
to
allow
certain
other
matters
to
be
set
*NL*
forth
,
which
are
required
to
clear
up
this
famous
history

CHAPTER
XXVII

*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IT
IS
SHOWN
WHO
MASTER
PEDRO
AND
HIS
APE
WERE
,
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
*NL*
MISHAP
DON
QUIXOTE
HAD
IN
THE
BRAYING
ADVENTURE
,
WHICH
HE
DID
NOT
*NL*
CONCLUDE
AS
HE
WOULD
HAVE
LIKED
OR
AS
HE
HAD
EXPECTED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Cide
Hamete
,
the
chronicler
of
this
great
history
,
begins
this
chapter
*NL*
with
these
words
,
``
I
swear
as
a
Catholic
Christian
;
''
with
regard
to
which
*NL*
his
translator
says
that
Cide
Hamete
's
swearing
as
a
Catholic
Christian
,
*NL*
he
being
--
as
no
doubt
he
was
--
a
Moor
,
only
meant
that
,
just
as
a
Catholic
*NL*
Christian
taking
an
oath
swears
,
or
ought
to
swear
,
what
is
true
,
and
*NL*
tell
the
truth
in
what
he
avers
,
so
he
was
telling
the
truth
,
as
much
as
*NL*
if
he
swore
as
a
Catholic
Christian
,
in
all
he
chose
to
write
about
*NL*
Quixote
,
especially
in
declaring
who
Master
Pedro
was
and
what
was
the
*NL*
divining
ape
that
astonished
all
the
villages
with
his
divinations
.
He
*NL*
says
,
then
,
that
he
who
has
read
the
First
Part
of
this
history
will
*NL*
remember
well
enough
the
Gines
de
Pasamonte
whom
,
with
other
galley
*NL*
slaves
,
Don
Quixote
set
free
in
the
Sierra
Morena
:
a
kindness
for
which
*NL*
he
afterwards
got
poor
thanks
and
worse
payment
from
that
evil-minded
,
*NL*
ill-conditioned
set
.
This
Gines
de
Pasamonte
--
Don
Ginesillo
de
Parapilla
,
*NL*
Don
Quixote
called
him
--
it
was
that
stole
Dapple
from
Sancho
Panza
;
*NL*
which
,
because
by
the
fault
of
the
printers
neither
the
how
nor
the
when
*NL*
was
stated
in
the
First
Part
,
has
been
a
puzzle
to
a
good
many
people
,
*NL*
who
attribute
to
the
bad
memory
of
the
author
what
was
the
error
of
the
*NL*
press
.
In
fact
,
however
,
Gines
stole
him
while
Sancho
Panza
was
asleep
on
*NL*
his
back
,
adopting
the
plan
and
device
that
Brunello
had
recourse
to
when
*NL*
he
stole
Sacripante
's
horse
from
between
his
legs
at
the
siege
of
*NL*
Albracca
;
and
,
as
has
been
told
,
Sancho
afterwards
recovered
him
.
This
*NL*
Gines
,
then
,
afraid
of
being
caught
by
the
officers
of
justice
,
who
were
*NL*
looking
for
him
to
punish
him
for
his
numberless
rascalities
and
offences
*NL*
-LRB-
which
were
so
many
and
so
great
that
he
himself
wrote
a
big
book
giving
*NL*
an
account
of
them
-RRB-
,
resolved
to
shift
his
quarters
into
the
kingdom
of
*NL*
Aragon
,
and
cover
up
his
left
eye
,
and
take
up
the
trade
of
a
*NL*
puppet-showman
;
for
this
,
as
well
as
juggling
,
he
knew
how
to
practise
to
*NL*
perfection
.
From
some
released
Christians
returning
from
Barbary
,
it
so
*NL*
happened
,
he
bought
the
ape
,
which
he
taught
to
mount
upon
his
shoulder
*NL*
on
his
making
a
certain
sign
,
and
to
whisper
,
or
seem
to
do
so
,
in
his
*NL*
ear
.
Thus
prepared
,
before
entering
any
village
whither
he
was
bound
with
*NL*
his
show
and
his
ape
,
he
used
to
inform
himself
at
the
nearest
village
,
*NL*
or
from
the
most
likely
person
he
could
find
,
as
to
what
particular
*NL*
things
had
happened
there
,
and
to
whom
;
and
bearing
them
well
in
mind
,
*NL*
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
exhibit
his
show
,
sometimes
one
story
,
*NL*
sometimes
another
,
but
all
lively
,
amusing
,
and
familiar
.
As
soon
as
the
*NL*
exhibition
was
over
he
brought
forward
the
accomplishments
of
his
ape
,
*NL*
assuring
the
public
that
he
divined
all
the
past
and
the
present
,
but
as
*NL*
to
the
future
he
had
no
skill
.
For
each
question
answered
he
asked
two
*NL*
reals
,
and
for
some
he
made
a
reduction
,
just
as
he
happened
to
feel
the
*NL*
pulse
of
the
questioners
;
and
when
now
and
then
he
came
to
houses
where
*NL*
things
that
he
knew
of
had
happened
to
the
people
living
there
,
even
if
*NL*
they
did
not
ask
him
a
question
,
not
caring
to
pay
for
it
,
he
would
make
*NL*
the
sign
to
the
ape
and
then
declare
that
it
had
said
so
and
so
,
which
*NL*
fitted
the
case
exactly
.
In
this
way
he
acquired
a
prodigious
name
and
*NL*
all
ran
after
him
;
on
other
occasions
,
being
very
crafty
,
he
would
answer
*NL*
in
such
a
way
that
the
answers
suited
the
questions
;
and
as
no
one
*NL*
cross-questioned
him
or
pressed
him
to
tell
how
his
ape
divined
,
he
made
*NL*
fools
of
them
all
and
filled
his
pouch
.
The
instant
he
entered
the
inn
he
*NL*
knew
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
,
and
with
that
knowledge
it
was
easy
for
him
*NL*
to
astonish
them
and
all
who
were
there
;
but
it
would
have
cost
him
dear
*NL*
had
Don
Quixote
brought
down
his
hand
a
little
lower
when
he
cut
off
King
*NL*
Marsilio
's
head
and
destroyed
all
his
horsemen
,
as
related
in
the
*NL*
preceeding
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
for
Master
Pedro
and
his
ape
;
and
now
to
return
to
Don
Quixote
of
*NL*
La
Mancha
.
After
he
had
left
the
inn
he
determined
to
visit
,
first
of
*NL*
all
,
the
banks
of
the
Ebro
and
that
neighbourhood
,
before
entering
the
*NL*
city
of
Saragossa
,
for
the
ample
time
there
was
still
to
spare
before
the
*NL*
jousts
left
him
enough
for
all
.
With
this
object
in
view
he
followed
the
*NL*
road
and
travelled
along
it
for
two
days
,
without
meeting
any
adventure
*NL*
worth
committing
to
writing
until
on
the
third
day
,
as
he
was
ascending
a
*NL*
hill
,
he
heard
a
great
noise
of
drums
,
trumpets
,
and
musket-shots
.
At
*NL*
first
he
imagined
some
regiment
of
soldiers
was
passing
that
way
,
and
to
*NL*
see
them
he
spurred
Rocinante
and
mounted
the
hill
.
On
reaching
the
top
*NL*
he
saw
at
the
foot
of
it
over
two
hundred
men
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
armed
*NL*
with
weapons
of
various
sorts
,
lances
,
crossbows
,
partisans
,
halberds
,
*NL*
and
pikes
,
and
a
few
muskets
and
a
great
many
bucklers
.
He
descended
the
*NL*
slope
and
approached
the
band
near
enough
to
see
distinctly
the
flags
,
*NL*
make
out
the
colours
and
distinguish
the
devices
they
bore
,
especially
*NL*
one
on
a
standard
or
ensign
of
white
satin
,
on
which
there
was
painted
in
*NL*
a
very
life-like
style
an
ass
like
a
little
sard
,
with
its
head
up
,
its
*NL*
mouth
open
and
its
tongue
out
,
as
if
it
were
in
the
act
and
attitude
of
*NL*
braying
;
and
round
it
were
inscribed
in
large
characters
these
two
lines
--
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
bray
in
vain
,
*NL*
Our
alcaldes
twain
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
device
Don
Quixote
concluded
that
these
people
must
be
from
the
*NL*
braying
town
,
and
he
said
so
to
Sancho
,
explaining
to
him
what
was
*NL*
written
on
the
standard
.
At
the
same
time
he
observed
that
the
man
who
*NL*
had
told
them
about
the
matter
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
two
who
*NL*
brayed
were
regidors
,
for
according
to
the
lines
of
the
standard
they
*NL*
were
alcaldes
.
To
which
Sancho
replied
,
``
Senor
,
there
's
nothing
to
stick
*NL*
at
in
that
,
for
maybe
the
regidors
who
brayed
then
came
to
be
alcaldes
of
*NL*
their
town
afterwards
,
and
so
they
may
go
by
both
titles
;
moreover
,
it
*NL*
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
truth
of
the
story
whether
the
brayers
were
*NL*
alcaldes
or
regidors
,
provided
at
any
rate
they
did
bray
;
for
an
alcalde
*NL*
is
just
as
likely
to
bray
as
a
regidor
.
''
They
perceived
,
in
short
,
*NL*
clearly
that
the
town
which
had
been
twitted
had
turned
out
to
do
battle
*NL*
with
some
other
that
had
jeered
it
more
than
was
fair
or
neighbourly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
proceeded
to
join
them
,
not
a
little
to
Sancho
's
uneasiness
,
*NL*
for
he
never
relished
mixing
himself
up
in
expeditions
of
that
sort
.
The
*NL*
members
of
the
troop
received
him
into
the
midst
of
them
,
taking
him
to
*NL*
be
some
one
who
was
on
their
side
.
Don
Quixote
,
putting
up
his
visor
,
*NL*
advanced
with
an
easy
bearing
and
demeanour
to
the
standard
with
the
ass
,
*NL*
and
all
the
chief
men
of
the
army
gathered
round
him
to
look
at
him
,
*NL*
staring
at
him
with
the
usual
amazement
that
everybody
felt
on
seeing
him
*NL*
for
the
first
time
.
Don
Quixote
,
seeing
them
examining
him
so
*NL*
attentively
,
and
that
none
of
them
spoke
to
him
or
put
any
question
to
*NL*
him
,
determined
to
take
advantage
of
their
silence
;
so
,
breaking
his
own
,
*NL*
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
said
,
``
Worthy
sirs
,
I
entreat
you
as
earnestly
*NL*
as
I
can
not
to
interrupt
an
argument
I
wish
to
address
to
you
,
until
you
*NL*
find
it
displeases
or
wearies
you
;
and
if
that
come
to
pass
,
on
the
*NL*
slightest
hint
you
give
me
I
will
put
a
seal
upon
my
lips
and
a
gag
upon
*NL*
my
tongue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
bade
him
say
what
he
liked
,
for
they
would
listen
to
him
*NL*
willingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
permission
Don
Quixote
went
on
to
say
,
``
I
,
sirs
,
am
a
*NL*
knight-errant
whose
calling
is
that
of
arms
,
and
whose
profession
is
to
*NL*
protect
those
who
require
protection
,
and
give
help
to
such
as
stand
in
*NL*
need
of
it
.
Some
days
ago
I
became
acquainted
with
your
misfortune
and
*NL*
the
cause
which
impels
you
to
take
up
arms
again
and
again
to
revenge
*NL*
yourselves
upon
your
enemies
;
and
having
many
times
thought
over
your
*NL*
business
in
my
mind
,
I
find
that
,
according
to
the
laws
of
combat
,
you
*NL*
are
mistaken
in
holding
yourselves
insulted
;
for
a
private
individual
*NL*
can
not
insult
an
entire
community
;
unless
it
be
by
defying
it
*NL*
collectively
as
a
traitor
,
because
he
can
not
tell
who
in
particular
is
*NL*
guilty
of
the
treason
for
which
he
defies
it
.
Of
this
we
have
an
example
*NL*
in
Don
Diego
Ordonez
de
Lara
,
who
defied
the
whole
town
of
Zamora
,
*NL*
because
he
did
not
know
that
Vellido
Dolfos
alone
had
committed
the
*NL*
treachery
of
slaying
his
king
;
and
therefore
he
defied
them
all
,
and
the
*NL*
vengeance
and
the
reply
concerned
all
;
though
,
to
be
sure
,
Senor
Don
*NL*
Diego
went
rather
too
far
,
indeed
very
much
beyond
the
limits
of
a
*NL*
defiance
;
for
he
had
no
occasion
to
defy
the
dead
,
or
the
waters
,
or
the
*NL*
fishes
,
or
those
yet
unborn
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
as
set
forth
;
but
let
*NL*
that
pass
,
for
when
anger
breaks
out
there
's
no
father
,
governor
,
or
*NL*
bridle
to
check
the
tongue
.
The
case
being
,
then
,
that
no
one
person
can
*NL*
insult
a
kingdom
,
province
,
city
,
state
,
or
entire
community
,
it
is
clear
*NL*
there
is
no
reason
for
going
out
to
avenge
the
defiance
of
such
an
*NL*
insult
,
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
one
.
A
fine
thing
it
would
be
if
the
people
*NL*
of
the
clock
town
were
to
be
at
loggerheads
every
moment
with
everyone
*NL*
who
called
them
by
that
name
,
--
or
the
Cazoleros
,
Berengeneros
,
*NL*
Ballenatos
,
Jaboneros
,
or
the
bearers
of
all
the
other
names
and
titles
*NL*
that
are
always
in
the
mouth
of
the
boys
and
common
people
!
It
would
be
a
*NL*
nice
business
indeed
if
all
these
illustrious
cities
were
to
take
huff
*NL*
and
revenge
themselves
and
go
about
perpetually
making
trombones
of
their
*NL*
swords
in
every
petty
quarrel
!
No
,
no
;
God
forbid
!
There
are
four
things
*NL*
for
which
sensible
men
and
well-ordered
States
ought
to
take
up
arms
,
*NL*
draw
their
swords
,
and
risk
their
persons
,
lives
,
and
properties
.
The
*NL*
first
is
to
defend
the
Catholic
faith
;
the
second
,
to
defend
one
's
life
,
*NL*
which
is
in
accordance
with
natural
and
divine
law
;
the
third
,
in
defence
*NL*
of
one
's
honour
,
family
,
and
property
;
the
fourth
,
in
the
service
of
*NL*
one
's
king
in
a
just
war
;
and
if
to
these
we
choose
to
add
a
fifth
-LRB-
which
*NL*
may
be
included
in
the
second
-RRB-
,
in
defence
of
one
's
country
.
To
these
*NL*
five
,
as
it
were
capital
causes
,
there
may
be
added
some
others
that
may
*NL*
be
just
and
reasonable
,
and
make
it
a
duty
to
take
up
arms
;
but
to
take
*NL*
them
up
for
trifles
and
things
to
laugh
at
and
he
amused
by
rather
than
*NL*
offended
,
looks
as
though
he
who
did
so
was
altogether
wanting
in
common
*NL*
sense
.
Moreover
,
to
take
an
unjust
revenge
-LRB-
and
there
can
not
be
any
just
*NL*
one
-RRB-
is
directly
opposed
to
the
sacred
law
that
we
acknowledge
,
wherein
*NL*
we
are
commanded
to
do
good
to
our
enemies
and
to
love
them
that
hate
us
;
*NL*
a
command
which
,
though
it
seems
somewhat
difficult
to
obey
,
is
only
so
*NL*
to
those
who
have
in
them
less
of
God
than
of
the
world
,
and
more
of
the
*NL*
flesh
than
of
the
spirit
;
for
Jesus
Christ
,
God
and
true
man
,
who
never
*NL*
lied
,
and
could
not
and
can
not
lie
,
said
,
as
our
law-giver
,
that
his
yoke
*NL*
was
easy
and
his
burden
light
;
he
would
not
,
therefore
,
have
laid
any
*NL*
command
upon
us
that
it
was
impossible
to
obey
.
Thus
,
sirs
,
you
are
bound
*NL*
to
keep
quiet
by
human
and
divine
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
take
me
,
''
said
Sancho
to
himself
at
this
,
``
but
this
master
of
*NL*
mine
is
a
theologian
;
or
,
if
not
,
faith
,
he
's
as
like
one
as
one
egg
is
*NL*
like
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
stopped
to
take
breath
,
and
,
observing
that
silence
was
still
*NL*
preserved
,
had
a
mind
to
continue
his
discourse
,
and
would
have
done
so
*NL*
had
not
Sancho
interposed
with
his
smartness
;
for
he
,
seeing
his
master
*NL*
pause
,
took
the
lead
,
saying
,
``
My
lord
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
who
once
*NL*
was
called
the
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
but
now
is
called
the
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Lions
,
is
a
gentleman
of
great
discretion
who
knows
Latin
*NL*
and
his
mother
tongue
like
a
bachelor
,
and
in
everything
that
he
deals
*NL*
with
or
advises
proceeds
like
a
good
soldier
,
and
has
all
the
laws
and
*NL*
ordinances
of
what
they
call
combat
at
his
fingers
'
ends
;
so
you
have
*NL*
nothing
to
do
but
to
let
yourselves
be
guided
by
what
he
says
,
and
on
my
*NL*
head
be
it
if
it
is
wrong
.
Besides
which
,
you
have
been
told
that
it
is
*NL*
folly
to
take
offence
at
merely
hearing
a
bray
.
I
remember
when
I
was
a
*NL*
boy
I
brayed
as
often
as
I
had
a
fancy
,
without
anyone
hindering
me
,
and
*NL*
so
elegantly
and
naturally
that
when
I
brayed
all
the
asses
in
the
town
*NL*
would
bray
;
but
I
was
none
the
less
for
that
the
son
of
my
parents
who
*NL*
were
greatly
respected
;
and
though
I
was
envied
because
of
the
gift
by
*NL*
more
than
one
of
the
high
and
mighty
ones
of
the
town
,
I
did
not
care
two
*NL*
farthings
for
it
;
and
that
you
may
see
I
am
telling
the
truth
,
wait
a
bit
*NL*
and
listen
,
for
this
art
,
like
swimming
,
once
learnt
is
never
forgotten
;
''
*NL*
and
then
,
taking
hold
of
his
nose
,
he
began
to
bray
so
vigorously
that
*NL*
all
the
valleys
around
rang
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
those
,
however
,
that
stood
near
him
,
fancying
he
was
mocking
them
,
*NL*
lifted
up
a
long
staff
he
had
in
his
hand
and
smote
him
such
a
blow
with
*NL*
it
that
Sancho
dropped
helpless
to
the
ground
.
Don
Quixote
,
seeing
him
so
*NL*
roughly
handled
,
attacked
the
man
who
had
struck
him
lance
in
hand
,
but
*NL*
so
many
thrust
themselves
between
them
that
he
could
not
avenge
him
.
Far
*NL*
from
it
,
finding
a
shower
of
stones
rained
upon
him
,
and
crossbows
and
*NL*
muskets
unnumbered
levelled
at
him
,
he
wheeled
Rocinante
round
and
,
as
*NL*
fast
as
his
best
gallop
could
take
him
,
fled
from
the
midst
of
them
,
*NL*
commending
himself
to
God
with
all
his
heart
to
deliver
him
out
of
this
*NL*
peril
,
in
dread
every
step
of
some
ball
coming
in
at
his
back
and
coming
*NL*
out
at
his
breast
,
and
every
minute
drawing
his
breath
to
see
whether
it
*NL*
had
gone
from
him
.
The
members
of
the
band
,
however
,
were
satisfied
with
*NL*
seeing
him
take
to
flight
,
and
did
not
fire
on
him
.
They
put
up
Sancho
,
*NL*
scarcely
restored
to
his
senses
,
on
his
ass
,
and
let
him
go
after
his
*NL*
master
;
not
that
he
was
sufficiently
in
his
wits
to
guide
the
beast
,
but
*NL*
Dapple
followed
the
footsteps
of
Rocinante
,
from
whom
he
could
not
remain
*NL*
a
moment
separated
.
Don
Quixote
having
got
some
way
off
looked
back
,
and
*NL*
seeing
Sancho
coming
,
waited
for
him
,
as
he
perceived
that
no
one
*NL*
followed
him
.
The
men
of
the
troop
stood
their
ground
till
night
,
and
as
*NL*
the
enemy
did
not
come
out
to
battle
,
they
returned
to
their
town
*NL*
exulting
;
and
had
they
been
aware
of
the
ancient
custom
of
the
Greeks
,
*NL*
they
would
have
erected
a
trophy
on
the
spot
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
MATTERS
THAT
BENENGELI
SAYS
HE
WHO
READS
THEM
WILL
KNOW
,
IF
HE
READS
*NL*
THEM
WITH
ATTENTION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
brave
man
flees
,
treachery
is
manifest
and
it
is
for
wise
men
to
*NL*
reserve
themselves
for
better
occasions
.
This
proved
to
be
the
case
with
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
who
,
giving
way
before
the
fury
of
the
townsfolk
and
the
*NL*
hostile
intentions
of
the
angry
troop
,
took
to
flight
and
,
without
a
*NL*
thought
of
Sancho
or
the
danger
in
which
he
was
leaving
him
,
retreated
to
*NL*
such
a
distance
as
he
thought
made
him
safe
.
Sancho
,
lying
across
his
*NL*
ass
,
followed
him
,
as
has
been
said
,
and
at
length
came
up
,
having
by
*NL*
this
time
recovered
his
senses
,
and
on
joining
him
let
himself
drop
off
*NL*
Dapple
at
Rocinante
's
feet
,
sore
,
bruised
,
and
belaboured
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
dismounted
to
examine
his
wounds
,
but
finding
him
whole
from
head
to
*NL*
foot
,
he
said
to
him
,
angrily
enough
,
``
In
an
evil
hour
didst
thou
take
to
*NL*
braying
,
Sancho
!
Where
hast
thou
learned
that
it
is
well
done
to
mention
*NL*
the
rope
in
the
house
of
the
man
that
has
been
hanged
?
To
the
music
of
*NL*
brays
what
harmonies
couldst
thou
expect
to
get
but
cudgels
?
Give
thanks
*NL*
to
God
,
Sancho
,
that
they
signed
the
cross
on
thee
just
now
with
a
stick
,
*NL*
and
did
not
mark
thee
per
signum
crucis
with
a
cutlass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
equal
to
answering
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
I
feel
as
if
I
was
*NL*
speaking
through
my
shoulders
;
let
us
mount
and
get
away
from
this
;
I
'll
*NL*
keep
from
braying
,
but
not
from
saying
that
knights-errant
fly
and
leave
*NL*
their
good
squires
to
be
pounded
like
privet
,
or
made
meal
of
at
the
*NL*
hands
of
their
enemies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
not
fly
who
retires
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
I
would
have
*NL*
thee
know
,
Sancho
,
that
the
valour
which
is
not
based
upon
a
foundation
*NL*
of
prudence
is
called
rashness
,
and
the
exploits
of
the
rash
man
are
to
*NL*
be
attributed
rather
to
good
fortune
than
to
courage
;
and
so
I
own
that
I
*NL*
retired
,
but
not
that
I
fled
;
and
therein
I
have
followed
the
example
of
*NL*
many
valiant
men
who
have
reserved
themselves
for
better
times
;
the
*NL*
histories
are
full
of
instances
of
this
,
but
as
it
would
not
be
any
good
*NL*
to
thee
or
pleasure
to
me
,
I
will
not
recount
them
to
thee
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
by
this
time
mounted
with
the
help
of
Don
Quixote
,
who
then
*NL*
himself
mounted
Rocinante
,
and
at
a
leisurely
pace
they
proceeded
to
take
*NL*
shelter
in
a
grove
which
was
in
sight
about
a
quarter
of
a
league
off
.
*NL*
Every
now
and
then
Sancho
gave
vent
to
deep
sighs
and
dismal
groans
,
and
*NL*
on
Don
Quixote
asking
him
what
caused
such
acute
suffering
,
he
replied
*NL*
that
,
from
the
end
of
his
back-bone
up
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
,
he
was
so
*NL*
sore
that
it
nearly
drove
him
out
of
his
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cause
of
that
soreness
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
will
be
,
no
doubt
,
that
*NL*
the
staff
wherewith
they
smote
thee
being
a
very
long
one
,
it
caught
thee
*NL*
all
down
the
back
,
where
all
the
parts
that
are
sore
are
situated
,
and
*NL*
had
it
reached
any
further
thou
wouldst
be
sorer
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
your
worship
has
relieved
me
of
a
great
doubt
,
*NL*
and
cleared
up
the
point
for
me
in
elegant
style
!
Body
o
'
me
!
is
the
*NL*
cause
of
my
soreness
such
a
mystery
that
there
's
any
need
to
tell
me
I
am
*NL*
sore
everywhere
the
staff
hit
me
?
If
it
was
my
ankles
that
pained
me
*NL*
there
might
be
something
in
going
divining
why
they
did
,
but
it
is
not
*NL*
much
to
divine
that
I
'm
sore
where
they
thrashed
me
.
By
my
faith
,
master
*NL*
mine
,
the
ills
of
others
hang
by
a
hair
;
every
day
I
am
discovering
more
*NL*
and
more
how
little
I
have
to
hope
for
from
keeping
company
with
your
*NL*
worship
;
for
if
this
time
you
have
allowed
me
to
be
drubbed
,
the
next
*NL*
time
,
or
a
hundred
times
more
,
we
'll
have
the
blanketings
of
the
other
*NL*
day
over
again
,
and
all
the
other
pranks
which
,
if
they
have
fallen
on
my
*NL*
shoulders
now
,
will
be
thrown
in
my
teeth
by-and-by
.
I
would
do
a
great
*NL*
deal
better
-LRB-
if
I
was
not
an
ignorant
brute
that
will
never
do
any
good
*NL*
all
my
life
-RRB-
,
I
would
do
a
great
deal
better
,
I
say
,
to
go
home
to
my
*NL*
wife
and
children
and
support
them
and
bring
them
up
on
what
God
may
*NL*
please
to
give
me
,
instead
of
following
your
worship
along
roads
that
*NL*
lead
nowhere
and
paths
that
are
none
at
all
,
with
little
to
drink
and
*NL*
less
to
eat
.
And
then
when
it
comes
to
sleeping
!
Measure
out
seven
feet
*NL*
on
the
earth
,
brother
squire
,
and
if
that
's
not
enough
for
you
,
take
as
*NL*
many
more
,
for
you
may
have
it
all
your
own
way
and
stretch
yourself
to
*NL*
your
heart
's
content
.
Oh
that
I
could
see
burnt
and
turned
to
ashes
the
*NL*
first
man
that
meddled
with
knight-errantry
or
at
any
rate
the
first
who
*NL*
chose
to
be
squire
to
such
fools
as
all
the
knights-errant
of
past
times
*NL*
must
have
been
!
Of
those
of
the
present
day
I
say
nothing
,
because
,
as
*NL*
your
worship
is
one
of
them
,
I
respect
them
,
and
because
I
know
your
*NL*
worship
knows
a
point
more
than
the
devil
in
all
you
say
and
think
.

*NL*
Don

gave
himself
a
great
slap
on
the
forehead
and
began
to
laugh
*NL*
heartily
,
and
said
he
,
``
Why

I
have
not
been
wandering
,
either
in
the
*NL*
Sierra
Morena
or
in
the
whole
course

barely
two

months
,
and
thou
sayest
,
Sancho
,
that
it
is
twenty
years
since
I
promised
*NL*
thee
the

I
believe
now
thou
wouldst
have
all
the
money
thou
hast

of
mine

in
thy
wages

If
so

if
that

thy

I
give
it
to

thee

much
good
may
it
do
thee

for
so
long

*NL*
I
see
myself
rid
of
such
a
good-for-nothing
squire
I
'll
be
glad
to
be
*NL*
left
a
pauper
without
a
rap

But
tell
me
,
thou
perverter
of

squirely

rules
of
knight-errantry
,
where
hast
thou
ever
seen

read
that
any
*NL*
knight-errant
's
squire
made
terms
with
his
lord

you
must
give
me
so
*NL*
much
a
month
for
serving
you

scoundrel
,
rogue
,
monster
--
for
*NL*
such
I
take
thee
to
be
--
plunge
,
I
say
,
into
the
mare
magnum
of
their
*NL*
histories
;
and
if
thou
shalt
find
that
any
squire
ever
said
or
thought
*NL*
what
thou
hast
said
now
,
I
will
let
thee
nail
it
on
my
forehead
,
and
give
*NL*
me
,
over
and
above
,
four
sound
slaps
in
the
face
.
Turn
the
rein
,
or
the
*NL*
halter
,
of
thy
Dapple
,
and
begone
home
;
for
one
single
step
further
thou
*NL*
shalt
not
make
in
my
company

O
bread
thanklessly
received
!
O
promises
*NL*
ill-bestowed
!
O
man
more
beast
than
human
being
!
Now
,
when
I
was
about
to
*NL*
raise
thee
to
such
a
position
,
that
,
in
spite
of
thy
wife
,
they
would
*NL*
call
thee
`
my
lord
,
'
thou
art
leaving
me

Thou
art
going
now
when
I
had
a
*NL*
firm

fixed
intention
of
making
thee
lord
of
the
best
island
in
the
*NL*
world

Well

as
thou
thyself
hast
said
before
now

honey
is
not

Ass
thou
art

ass
thou
wilt
be
,
and
ass
thou
wilt
end
*NL*
when
the
course
of
thy
life
is
run
;
for
I
know
it
will
come
to
its
close
*NL*
before
thou
dost
perceive
or
discern
that
thou
art
a
beast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
regarded
Don
Quixote
earnestly
while
he
was
giving
him
this
*NL*
rating
,
and
was
so
touched
by
remorse
that
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
in
a
piteous
and
broken
voice
he
said
to
him
,
``
Master
mine
,
I
confess
*NL*
that
,
to
be
a
complete
ass
,
all
I
want
is
a
tail
;
if
your
worship
will
*NL*
only
fix
one
on
to
me
,
I
'll
look
on
it
as
rightly
placed
,
and
I
'll
serve
*NL*
you
as
an
ass
all
the
remaining
days
of
my
life
.
Forgive
me
and
have
pity
*NL*
on
my
folly
,
and
remember
I
know
but
little
,
and
,
if
I
talk
much
,
it
's
*NL*
more
from
infirmity
than
malice
;
but
he
who
sins
and
mends
commends
*NL*
himself
to
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
been
surprised
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
thou
hadst
*NL*
not
introduced
some
bit
of
a
proverb
into
thy
speech
.
Well
,
well
,
I
*NL*
forgive
thee
,
provided
thou
dost
mend
and
not
show
thyself
in
future
so
*NL*
fond
of
thine
own
interest
,
but
try
to
be
of
good
cheer
and
take
heart
,
*NL*
and
encourage
thyself
to
look
forward
to
the
fulfillment
of
my
promises
,
*NL*
which
,
by
being
delayed
,
does
not
become
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
said
he
would
do
so
,
and
keep
up
his
heart
as
best
he
could
.
They
*NL*
then
entered
the
grove
,
and
Don
Quixote
settled
himself
at
the
foot
of
an
*NL*
elm
,
and
Sancho
at
that
of
a
beech
,
for
trees
of
this
kind
and
others
*NL*
like
them
always
have
feet
but
no
hands
.
Sancho
passed
the
night
in
pain
,
*NL*
for
with
the
evening
dews
the
blow
of
the
staff
made
itself
felt
all
the
*NL*
more
.
Don
Quixote
passed
it
in
his
never-failing
meditations
;
but
,
for
*NL*
all
that
,
they
had
some
winks
of
sleep
,
and
with
the
appearance
of
*NL*
daylight
they
pursued
their
journey
in
quest
of
the
banks
of
the
famous
*NL*
Ebro
,
where
that
befell
them
which
will
be
told
in
the
following
chapter
.

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
FAMOUS
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
ENCHANTED
BARK
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
stages
as
already
described
or
left
undescribed
,
two
days
after
*NL*
quitting
the
grove
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
reached
the
river
Ebro
,
and
the
*NL*
sight
of
it
was
a
great
delight
to
Don
Quixote
as
he
contemplated
and
*NL*
gazed
upon
the
charms
of
its
banks
,
the
clearness
of
its
stream
,
the
*NL*
gentleness
of
its
current
and
the
abundance
of
its
crystal
waters
;
and
*NL*
the
pleasant
view
revived
a
thousand
tender
thoughts
in
his
mind
.
Above
*NL*
all
,
he
dwelt
upon
what
he
had
seen
in
the
cave
of
Montesinos
;
for
though
*NL*
Master
Pedro
's
ape
had
told
him
that
of
those
things
part
was
true
,
part
*NL*
false
,
he
clung
more
to
their
truth
than
to
their
falsehood
,
the
very
*NL*
reverse
of
Sancho
,
who
held
them
all
to
be
downright
lies
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
were
thus
proceeding
,
then
,
they
discovered
a
small
boat
,
without
*NL*
oars
or
any
other
gear
,
that
lay
at
the
water
's
edge
tied
to
the
stem
of
*NL*
a
tree
growing
on
the
bank
.
Don
Quixote
looked
all
round
,
and
seeing
*NL*
nobody
,
at
once
,
without
more
ado
,
dismounted
from
Rocinante
and
bade
*NL*
Sancho
get
down
from
Dapple
and
tie
both
beasts
securely
to
the
trunk
of
*NL*
a
poplar
or
willow
that
stood
there
.
Sancho
asked
him
the
reason
of
this
*NL*
sudden
dismounting
and
tying
.
Don
Quixote
made
answer
,
``
Thou
must
know
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
that
this
bark
is
plainly
,
and
without
the
possibility
of
any
*NL*
alternative
,
calling
and
inviting
me
to
enter
it
,
and
in
it
go
to
give
*NL*
aid
to
some
knight
or
other
person
of
distinction
in
need
of
it
,
who
is
*NL*
no
doubt
in
some
sore
strait
;
for
this
is
the
way
of
the
books
of
*NL*
chivalry
and
of
the
enchanters
who
figure
and
speak
in
them
.
When
a
*NL*
knight
is
involved
in
some
difficulty
from
which
he
can
not
be
delivered
*NL*
save
by
the
hand
of
another
knight
,
though
they
may
be
at
a
distance
of
*NL*
two
or
three
thousand
leagues
or
more
one
from
the
other
,
they
either
*NL*
take
him
up
on
a
cloud
,
or
they
provide
a
bark
for
him
to
get
into
,
and
*NL*
in
less
than
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
they
carry
him
where
they
will
and
*NL*
where
his
help
is
required
;
and
so
,
Sancho
,
this
bark
is
placed
here
for
*NL*
the
same
purpose
;
this
is
as
true
as
that
it
is
now
day
,
and
ere
this
one
*NL*
passes
tie
Dapple
and
Rocinante
together
,
and
then
in
God
's
hand
be
it
to
*NL*
guide
us
;
for
I
would
not
hold
back
from
embarking
,
though
barefooted
*NL*
friars
were
to
beg
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
that
's
the
case
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
your
worship
chooses
to
give
in
*NL*
to
these
--
I
do
n't
know
if
I
may
call
them
absurdities
--
at
every
turn
,
*NL*
there
's
nothing
for
it
but
to
obey
and
bow
the
head
,
bearing
in
mind
the
*NL*
proverb
,
`
Do
as
thy
master
bids
thee
,
and
sit
down
to
table
with
him
;
'
*NL*
but
for
all
that
,
for
the
sake
of
easing
my
conscience
,
I
warn
your
*NL*
worship
that
it
is
my
opinion
this
bark
is
no
enchanted
one
,
but
belongs
*NL*
to
some
of
the
fishermen
of
the
river
,
for
they
catch
the
best
shad
in
*NL*
the
world
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Sancho
said
this
,
he
tied
the
beasts
,
leaving
them
to
the
care
and
*NL*
protection
of
the
enchanters
with
sorrow
enough
in
his
heart
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
bade
him
not
be
uneasy
about
deserting
the
animals
,
``
for
he
who
would
*NL*
carry
themselves
over
such
longinquous
roads
and
regions
would
take
care
*NL*
to
feed
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
that
logiquous
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
nor
have
I
ever
heard
*NL*
the
word
all
the
days
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Longinquous
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
means
far
off
;
but
it
is
no
wonder
*NL*
thou
dost
not
understand
it
,
for
thou
art
not
bound
to
know
Latin
,
like
*NL*
some
who
pretend
to
know
it
and
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
they
are
tied
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
what
are
we
to
do
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
cross
ourselves
and
weigh
anchor
;
I
mean
,
*NL*
embark
and
cut
the
moorings
by
which
the
bark
is
held
;
''
and
the
bark
*NL*
began
to
drift
away
slowly
from
the
bank
.
But
when
Sancho
saw
himself
*NL*
somewhere
about
two
yards
out
in
the
river
,
he
began
to
tremble
and
give
*NL*
himself
up
for
lost
;
but
nothing
distressed
him
more
than
hearing
Dapple
*NL*
bray
and
seeing
Rocinante
struggling
to
get
loose
,
and
said
he
to
his
*NL*
master
,
``
Dapple
is
braying
in
grief
at
our
leaving
him
,
and
Rocinante
is
*NL*
trying
to
escape
and
plunge
in
after
us
.
O
dear
friends
,
peace
be
with
*NL*
you
,
and
may
this
madness
that
is
taking
us
away
from
you
,
turned
into
*NL*
sober
sense
,
bring
us
back
to
you
.
''
And
with
this
he
fell
weeping
so
*NL*
bitterly
,
that
Don
Quixote
said
to
him
,
sharply
and
angrily
,
``
What
art
*NL*
thou
afraid
of
,
cowardly
creature
?
What
art
thou
weeping
at
,
heart
of
*NL*
butter-paste
?
Who
pursues
or
molests
thee
,
thou
soul
of
a
tame
mouse
?
*NL*
What
dost
thou
want
,
unsatisfied
in
the
very
heart
of
abundance
?
Art
*NL*
thou
,
perchance
,
tramping
barefoot
over
the
Riphaean
mountains
,
instead
*NL*
of
being
seated
on
a
bench
like
an
archduke
on
the
tranquil
stream
of
*NL*
this
pleasant
river
,
from
which
in
a
short
space
we
shall
come
out
upon
*NL*
the
broad
sea
?
But
we
must
have
already
emerged
and
gone
seven
hundred
or
*NL*
eight
hundred
leagues
;
and
if
I
had
here
an
astrolabe
to
take
the
*NL*
altitude
of
the
pole
,
I
could
tell
thee
how
many
we
have
travelled
,
*NL*
though
either
I
know
little
,
or
we
have
already
crossed
or
shall
shortly
*NL*
cross
the
equinoctial
line
which
parts
the
two
opposite
poles
midway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
we
come
to
that
line
your
worship
speaks
of
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
how
*NL*
far
shall
we
have
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
far
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
of
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
*NL*
that
this
terraqueous
globe
contains
,
as
computed
by
Ptolemy
,
the
*NL*
greatest
cosmographer
known
,
we
shall
have
travelled
one-half
when
we
*NL*
come
to
the
line
I
spoke
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
your
worship
gives
me
a
nice
authority
for
what
*NL*
you
say
,
putrid
Dolly
something
transmogrified
,
or
whatever
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
laughed
at
the
interpretation
Sancho
put
upon
``
computed
,
''
and
*NL*
the
name
of
the
cosmographer
Ptolemy
,
and
said
he
,
``
Thou
must
know
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
that
with
the
Spaniards
and
those
who
embark
at
Cadiz
for
the
*NL*
East
Indies
,
one
of
the
signs
they
have
to
show
them
when
they
have
*NL*
passed
the
equinoctial
line
I
told
thee
of
,
is
,
that
the
lice
die
upon
*NL*
everybody
on
board
the
ship
,
and
not
a
single
one
is
left
,
or
to
be
found
*NL*
in
the
whole
vessel
if
they
gave
its
weight
in
gold
for
it
;
so
,
Sancho
,
*NL*
thou
mayest
as
well
pass
thy
hand
down
thy
thigh
,
and
if
thou
comest
upon
*NL*
anything
alive
we
shall
be
no
longer
in
doubt
;
if
not
,
then
we
have
*NL*
crossed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
a
bit
of
it
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
still
,
I
'll
do
as
your
*NL*
worship
bids
me
;
though
I
do
n't
know
what
need
there
is
for
trying
these
*NL*
experiments
,
for
I
can
see
with
my
own
eyes
that
we
have
not
moved
five
*NL*
yards
away
from
the
bank
,
or
shifted
two
yards
from
where
the
animals
*NL*
stand
,
for
there
are
Rocinante
and
Dapple
in
the
very
same
place
where
we
*NL*
left
them
;
and
watching
a
point
,
as
I
do
now
,
I
swear
by
all
that
's
good
,
*NL*
we
are
not
stirring
or
moving
at
the
pace
of
an
ant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
the
test
I
told
thee
of
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
do
n't
mind
*NL*
any
other

thou

nothing

*NL*

if
thou
wert
acquainted
with
all
these
things

thou

see
clearly

we
have
seen

But
again
I
tell

I
am

certain
thou
art
cleaner
than

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
felt
,
and
passing
his
hand
gently
and
carefully
down
to
the
hollow
*NL*
of
his
left
knee
,
he
looked
up
at
his
master
and
said
,
``
Either
the
test
*NL*
is
a
false
one
,
or
we
have
not
come
to
where
your
worship
says
,
nor
*NL*
within
many
leagues
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
so
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
;
``
hast
thou
come
upon
aught
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
and
aughts
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
and
shaking
his
fingers
he
washed
his
*NL*
whole
hand
in
the
river
along
which
the
boat
was
quietly
gliding
in
*NL*
midstream
,
not
moved
by
any
occult
intelligence
or
invisible
enchanter
,
*NL*
but
simply
by
the
current
,
just
there
smooth
and
gentle
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
came
in
sight
of
some
large
water
mills
that
stood
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
river
,
and
the
instant
Don
Quixote
saw
them
he
cried
out
,
``
Seest
*NL*
thou
there
,
my
friend
?
there
stands
the
castle
or
fortress
,
where
there
*NL*
is
,
no
doubt
,
some
knight
in
durance
,
or
ill-used
queen
,
or
infanta
,
or
*NL*
princess
,
in
whose
aid
I
am
brought
hither
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
city
,
fortress
,
or
castle
is
your
worship
talking
about
,
*NL*
senor
?
''
said
Sancho
;
``
do
n't
you
see
that
those
are
mills
that
stand
in
*NL*
the
river
to
grind
corn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
thy
peace
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
though
they
look
like
mills
*NL*
they
are
not
so
;
I
have
already
told
thee
that
enchantments
transform
*NL*
things
and
change
their
proper
shapes
;
I
do
not
mean
to
say
they
really
*NL*
change
them
from
one
form
into
another
,
but
that
it
seems
as
though
they
*NL*
did
,
as
experience
proved
in
the
transformation
of
Dulcinea
,
sole
refuge
*NL*
of
my
hopes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
,
the
boat
,
having
reached
the
middle
of
the
stream
,
began
to
*NL*
move
less
slowly
than
hitherto
.
The
millers
belonging
to
the
mills
,
when
*NL*
they
saw
the
boat
coming
down
the
river
,
and
on
the
point
of
being
sucked
*NL*
in
by
the
draught
of
the
wheels
,
ran
out
in
haste
,
several
of
them
,
with
*NL*
long
poles
to
stop
it
,
and
being
all
mealy
,
with
faces
and
garments
*NL*
covered
with
flour
,
they
presented
a
sinister
appearance
.
They
raised
*NL*
loud
shouts
,
crying
,
``
Devils
of
men
,
where
are
you
going
to
?
Are
you
mad
?
*NL*
Do
you
want
to
drown
yourselves
,
or
dash
yourselves
to
pieces
among
these
*NL*
wheels
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
not
tell
thee
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
at
this
,
``
that
we
had
*NL*
reached
the
place
where
I
am
to
show
what
the
might
of
my
arm
can
do
?
See
*NL*
what
ruffians
and
villains
come
out
against
me
;
see
what
monsters
oppose
*NL*
me
;
see
what
hideous
countenances
come
to
frighten
us
!
You
shall
soon
*NL*
see
,
scoundrels
!
''
And
then
standing
up
in
the
boat
he
began
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
to
hurl
threats
at
the
millers
,
exclaiming
,
``
Ill-conditioned
and
*NL*
worse-counselled
rabble
,
restore
to
liberty
and
freedom
the
person
ye
*NL*
hold
in
durance
in
this
your
fortress
or
prison
,
high
or
low
or
of
*NL*
whatever
rank
or
quality
he
be
,
for
I
am
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
*NL*
otherwise
called
the
Knight
of
the
Lions
,
for
whom
,
by
the
disposition
of
*NL*
heaven
above
,
it
is
reserved
to
give
a
happy
issue
to
this
adventure
;
''
*NL*
and
so
saying
he
drew
his
sword
and
began
making
passes
in
the
air
at
the
*NL*
millers
,
who
,
hearing
but
not
understanding
all
this
nonsense
,
strove
to
*NL*
stop
the
boat
,
which
was
now
getting
into
the
rushing
channel
of
the
*NL*
wheels
.
Sancho
fell
upon
his
knees
devoutly
appealing
to
heaven
to
*NL*
deliver
him
from
such
imminent
peril
;
which
it
did
by
the
activity
and
*NL*
quickness
of
the
millers
,
who
,
pushing
against
the
boat
with
their
poles
,
*NL*
stopped
it
,
not
,
however
,
without
upsetting
and
throwing
Don
Quixote
and
*NL*
Sancho
into
the
water
;
and
lucky
it
was
for
Don
Quixote
that
he
could
*NL*
swim
like
a
goose
,
though
the
weight
of
his
armour
carried
him
twice
to
*NL*
the
bottom
;
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
millers
,
who
plunged
in
and
*NL*
hoisted
them
both
out
,
it
would
have
been
Troy
town
with
the
pair
of
*NL*
them
.
As
soon
as
,
more
drenched
than
thirsty
,
they
were
landed
,
Sancho
*NL*
went
down
on
his
knees
and
with
clasped
hands
and
eyes
raised
to
heaven
,
*NL*
prayed
a
long
and
fervent
prayer
to
God
to
deliver
him
evermore
from
the
*NL*
rash
projects
and
attempts
of
his
master
.
The
fishermen
,
the
owners
of
*NL*
the
boat
,
which
the
mill-wheels
had
knocked
to
pieces
,
now
came
up
,
and
*NL*
seeing
it
smashed
they
proceeded
to
strip
Sancho
and
to
demand
payment
*NL*
for
it
from
Don
Quixote
;
but
he
with
great
calmness
,
just
as
if
nothing
*NL*
had
happened
him
,
told
the
millers
and
fishermen
that
he
would
pay
for
*NL*
the
bark
most
cheerfully
,
on
condition
that
they
delivered
up
to
him
,
*NL*
free
and
unhurt
,
the
person
or
persons
that
were
in
durance
in
that
*NL*
castle
of
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
persons
or
what
castle
art
thou
talking
of
,
madman
?
Art
thou
for
*NL*
carrying
off
the
people
who
come
to
grind
corn
in
these
mills
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
to
himself
,
``
it
would
be
preaching
in
*NL*
the
desert
to
attempt
by
entreaties
to
induce
this
rabble
to
do
any
*NL*
virtuous
action
.
In
this
adventure
two
mighty
enchanters
must
have
*NL*
encountered
one
another
,
and
one
frustrates
what
the
other
attempts
;
one
*NL*
provided
the
bark
for
me
,
and
the
other
upset
me
;
God
help
us
,
this
world
*NL*
is
all
machinations
and
schemes
at
cross
purposes
one
with
the
other
.
I
*NL*
can
do
no
more
.
''
And
then
turning
towards
the
mills
he
said
aloud
,
*NL*
``
Friends
,
whoe'er
ye
be
that
are
immured
in
that
prison
,
forgive
me
that
,
*NL*
to
my
misfortune
and
yours
,
I
can
not
deliver
you
from
your
misery
;
this
*NL*
adventure
is
doubtless
reserved
and
destined
for
some
other
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
he
settled
with
the
fishermen
,
and
paid
fifty
reals
for
the
*NL*
boat
,
which
Sancho
handed
to
them
very
much
against
the
grain
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
With
a
couple
more
bark
businesses
like
this
we
shall
have
sunk
our
*NL*
whole
capital
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fishermen
and
the
millers
stood
staring
in
amazement
at
the
two
*NL*
figures
,
so
very
different
to
all
appearance
from
ordinary
men
,
and
were
*NL*
wholly
unable
to
make
out
the
drift
of
the
observations
and
questions
Don
*NL*
Quixote
addressed
to
them
;
and
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
*NL*
madmen
,
they
left
them
and
betook
themselves
,
the
millers
to
their
mills
,
*NL*
and
the
fishermen
to
their
huts
.
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
returned
to
their
*NL*
beasts
,
and
to
their
life
of
beasts
,
and
so
ended
the
adventure
of
the
*NL*
enchanted
bark
.

CHAPTER
XXX
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
DON
QUIXOTE
'S
ADVENTURE
WITH
A
FAIR
HUNTRESS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
their
beasts
in
low
spirits
and
bad
humour
enough
,
knight
*NL*
and
squire
,
Sancho
particularly
,
for
with
him
what
touched
the
stock
of
*NL*
money
touched
his
heart
,
and
when
any
was
taken
from
him
he
felt
as
if
he
*NL*
was
robbed
of
the
apples
of
his
eyes
.
In
fine
,
without
exchanging
a
word
,
*NL*
they
mounted
and
quitted
the
famous
river
,
Don
Quixote
absorbed
in
*NL*
thoughts
of
his
love
,
Sancho
in
thinking
of
his
advancement
,
which
just
*NL*
then
,
it
seemed
to
him
,
he
was
very
far
from
securing
;
for
,
fool
as
he
*NL*
was
,
he
saw
clearly
enough
that
his
master
's
acts
were
all
or
most
of
*NL*
them
utterly
senseless
;
and
he
began
to
cast
about
for
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
retiring
from
his
service
and
going
home
some
day
,
without
entering
into
*NL*
any
explanations
or
taking
any
farewell
of
him
.
Fortune
,
however
,
ordered
*NL*
matters
after
a
fashion
very
much
the
opposite
of
what
he
contemplated
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
the
next
day
towards
sunset
,
on
coming
out
of
a
wood
,
*NL*
Don
Quixote
cast
his
eyes
over
a
green
meadow
,
and
at
the
far
end
of
it
*NL*
observed
some
people
,
and
as
he
drew
nearer
saw
that
it
was
a
hawking
*NL*
party
.
Coming
closer
,
he
distinguished
among
them
a
lady
of
graceful
*NL*
mien
,
on
a
pure
white
palfrey
or
hackney
caparisoned
with
green
trappings
*NL*
and
a
silver-mounted
side-saddle
.
The
lady
was
also
in
green
,
and
so
*NL*
richly
and
splendidly
dressed
that
splendour
itself
seemed
personified
in
*NL*
her
.
On
her
left
hand
she
bore
a
hawk
,
a
proof
to
Don
Quixote
's
mind
that
*NL*
she
must
be
some
great
lady
and
the
mistress
of
the
whole
hunting
party
,
*NL*
which
was
the
fact
;
so
he
said
to
Sancho
,
``
Run
Sancho
,
my
son
,
and
say
to
*NL*
that
lady
on
the
palfrey
with
the
hawk
that
I
,
the
Knight
of
the
Lions
,
*NL*
kiss
the
hands
of
her
exalted
beauty
,
and
if
her
excellence
will
grant
me
*NL*
leave
I
will
go
and
kiss
them
in
person
and
place
myself
at
her
service
*NL*
for
aught
that
may
be
in
my
power
and
her
highness
may
command
;
and
mind
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
how
thou
speakest
,
and
take
care
not
to
thrust
in
any
of
thy
*NL*
proverbs
into
thy
message
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
a
likely
one
here
to
thrust
any
in
!
''
said
Sancho
;
``
leave
me
*NL*
alone
for
that
!
Why
,
this
is
not
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
have
carried
*NL*
messages
to
high
and
exalted
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
that
thou
didst
carry
to
the
lady
Dulcinea
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
*NL*
know
not
that
thou
hast
carried
any
other
,
at
least
in
my
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
but
pledges
do
n't
distress
a
good
payer
,
*NL*
and
in
a
house
where
there
's
plenty
supper
is
soon
cooked
;
I
mean
there
's
*NL*
no
need
of
telling
or
warning
me
about
anything
;
for
I
'm
ready
for
*NL*
everything
and
know
a
little
of
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
believe
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
go
and
good
luck
to
thee
,
*NL*
and
God
speed
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
went
off
at
top
speed
,
forcing
Dapple
out
of
his
regular
pace
,
and
*NL*
came
to
where
the
fair
huntress
was
standing
,
and
dismounting
knelt
*NL*
before
her
and
said
,
``
Fair
lady
,
that
knight
that
you
see
there
,
the
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Lions
by
name
,
is
my
master
,
and
I
am
a
squire
of
his
,
and
*NL*
at
home
they
call
me
Sancho
Panza
.
This
same
Knight
of
the
Lions
,
who
was
*NL*
called
not
long
since
the
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
sends
by
me
*NL*
to
say
may
it
please
your
highness
to
give
him
leave
that
,
with
your
*NL*
permission
,
approbation
,
and
consent
,
he
may
come
and
carry
out
his
*NL*
wishes
,
which
are
,
as
he
says
and
I
believe
,
to
serve
your
exalted
*NL*
loftiness
and
beauty
;
and
if
you
give
it
,
your
ladyship
will
do
a
thing
*NL*
which
will
redound
to
your
honour
,
and
he
will
receive
a
most
*NL*
distinguished
favour
and
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
indeed
,
squire
,
''
said
the
lady
,
``
delivered
your
message
with
*NL*
all
the
formalities
such
messages
require
;
rise
up
,
for
it
is
not
right
*NL*
that
the
squire
of
a
knight
so
great
as
he
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
of
*NL*
whom
we
have
heard
a
great
deal
here
,
should
remain
on
his
knees
;
rise
,
*NL*
my
friend
,
and
bid
your
master
welcome
to
the
services
of
myself
and
the
*NL*
duke
my
husband
,
in
a
country
house
we
have
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
got
up
,
charmed
as
much
by
the
beauty
of
the
good
lady
as
by
her
*NL*
high-bred
air
and
her
courtesy
,
but
,
above
all
,
by
what
she
had
said
*NL*
about
having
heard
of
his
master
,
the
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
;
*NL*
for
if
she
did
not
call
him
Knight
of
the
Lions
it
was
no
doubt
because
*NL*
he
had
so
lately
taken
the
name
.
``
Tell
me
,
brother
squire
,
''
asked
the
*NL*
duchess
-LRB-
whose
title
,
however
,
is
not
known
-RRB-
,
``
this
master
of
yours
,
is
*NL*
he
not
one
of
whom
there
is
a
history
extant
in
print
,
called
`
The
*NL*
Ingenious
Gentleman
,
Don
Quixote
of
La

,

who
has
for
the
lady
of
*NL*
his
heart
a
certain
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
same
,
senora
,
''
replied
Sancho
;
``
and
that
squire
of
his
who
*NL*
figures
,
or
ought
to
figure
,
in
the
said
history
under
the
name
of
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
,
is
myself
,
unless
they
have
changed
me
in
the
cradle
,
I
mean
in
*NL*
the
press
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
rejoiced
at
all
this
,
''
said
the
duchess
;
``
go
,
brother
Panza
,
and
*NL*
tell
your
master
that
he
is
welcome
to
my
estate
,
and
that
nothing
could
*NL*
happen
to
me
that
could
give
me
greater
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
returned
to
his
master
mightily
pleased
with
this
gratifying
*NL*
answer
,
and
told
him
all
the
great
lady
had
said
to
him
,
lauding
to
the
*NL*
skies
,
in
his
rustic
phrase
,
her
rare
beauty
,
her
graceful
gaiety
,
and
*NL*
her
courtesy
.
Don
Quixote
drew
himself
up
briskly
in
his
saddle
,
fixed
*NL*
himself
in
his
stirrups
,
settled
his
visor
,
gave
Rocinante
the
spur
,
and
*NL*
with
an
easy
bearing
advanced
to
kiss
the
hands
of
the
duchess
,
who
,
*NL*
having
sent
to
summon
the
duke
her
husband
,
told
him
while
Don
Quixote
*NL*
was
approaching
all
about
the
message
;
and
as
both
of
them
had
read
the
*NL*
First
Part
of
this
history
,
and
from
it
were
aware
of
Don
Quixote
's
crazy
*NL*
turn
,
they
awaited
him
with
the
greatest
delight
and
anxiety
to
make
his
*NL*
acquaintance
,
meaning
to
fall
in
with
his
humour
and
agree
with
*NL*
everything
he
said
,
and
,
so
long
as
he
stayed
with
them
,
to
treat
him
as
*NL*
a
knight-errant
,
with
all
the
ceremonies
usual
in
the
books
of
chivalry
*NL*
they
had
read
,
for
they
themselves
were
very
fond
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
now
came
up
with
his
visor
raised
,
and
as
he
seemed
about
to
*NL*
dismount
Sancho
made
haste
to
go
and
hold
his
stirrup
for
him
;
but
in
*NL*
getting
down
off
Dapple
he
was
so
unlucky
as
to
hitch
his
foot
in
one
of
*NL*
the
ropes
of
the
pack-saddle
in
such
a
way
that
he
was
unable
to
free
it
,
*NL*
and
was
left
hanging
by
it
with
his
face
and
breast
on
the
ground
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
was
not
used
to
dismount
without
having
the
stirrup
held
,
*NL*
fancying
that
Sancho
had
by
this
time
come
to
hold
it
for
him
,
threw
*NL*
himself
off
with
a
lurch
and
brought
Rocinante
's
saddle
after
him
,
which
*NL*
was
no
doubt
badly
girthed
,
and
saddle
and
he
both
came
to
the
ground
;
*NL*
not
without
discomfiture
to
him
and
abundant
curses
muttered
between
his
*NL*
teeth
against
the
unlucky
Sancho
,
who
had
his
foot
still
in
the
shackles
.
*NL*
The
duke
ordered
his
huntsmen
to
go
to
the
help
of
knight
and
squire
,
and
*NL*
they
raised
Don
Quixote
,
sorely
shaken
by
his
fall
;
and
he
,
limping
,
*NL*
advanced
as
best
he
could
to
kneel
before
the
noble
pair
.
This
,
however
,
*NL*
the
duke
would
by
no
means
permit
;
on
the
contrary
,
dismounting
from
his
*NL*
horse
,
he
went
and
embraced
Don
Quixote
,
saying
,
``
I
am
grieved
,
Sir
*NL*
Knight
of
the
Rueful
Countenance
,
that
your
first
experience
on
my
ground
*NL*
should
have
been
such
an
unfortunate
one
as
we
have
seen
;
but
the
*NL*
carelessness
of
squires
is
often
the
cause
of
worse
accidents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
which
has
happened
me
in
meeting
you
,
mighty
prince
,
''
replied
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
can
not
be
unfortunate
,
even
if
my
fall
had
not
stopped
short
of
*NL*
the
depths
of
the
bottomless
pit
,
for
the
glory
of
having
seen
you
would
*NL*
have
lifted
me
up
and
delivered
me
from
it
.
My
squire
,
God
's
curse
upon
*NL*
him
,
is
better
at
unloosing
his
tongue
in
talking
impertinence
than
in
*NL*
tightening
the
girths
of
a
saddle
to
keep
it
steady
;
but
however
I
may
*NL*
be
,
fallen
or
raised
up
,
on
foot
or
on
horseback
,
I
shall
always
be
at
*NL*
your
service
and
that
of
my
lady
the
duchess
,
your
worthy
consort
,
worthy
*NL*
queen
of
beauty
and
paramount
princess
of
courtesy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gently
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
''
said
the
duke
;
``
where
my
lady
*NL*
Dona
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
is
,
it
is
not
right
that
other
beauties
should
*NL*
be
praised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
by
this
time
released
from
his
entanglement
,
was
standing
by
,
and
*NL*
before
his
master
could
answer
he
said
,
``
There
is
no
denying
,
and
it
must
*NL*
be
maintained
,
that
my
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
is
very
beautiful
;
but
*NL*
the
hare
jumps
up
where
one
least
expects
it
;
and
I
have
heard
say
that
*NL*
what
we
call
nature
is
like
a
potter
that
makes
vessels
of
clay
,
and
he
*NL*
who
makes
one
fair
vessel
can
as
well
make
two
,
or
three
,
or
a
hundred
;
I
*NL*
say
so
because
,
by
my
faith
,
my
lady
the
duchess
is
in
no
way
behind
my
*NL*
mistress
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
turned
to
the
duchess
and
said
,
``
Your
highness
may
conceive
*NL*
that
never
had
knight-errant
in
this
world
a
more
talkative
or
a
droller
*NL*
squire
than
I
have
,
and
he
will
prove
the
truth
of
what
I
say
,
if
your
*NL*
highness
is
pleased
to
accept
of
my
services
for
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
duchess
made
answer
,
``
that
worthy
Sancho
is
droll
I
consider
*NL*
a
very
good
thing
,
because
it
is
a
sign
that

is
shrewd
;
for
drollery
*NL*

sprightliness
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
as
you
very
well
know
,
do
not
take
*NL*
up
their

with
dull
wits

as
good
Sancho
is
droll

sprightly

I
here
set
him
down

shrewd

*NL*
*NL*
``

talkative

added
Don

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much

better

said
the
duke
,
``
for
many
droll

*NL*
*NL*
``

Sancho
,
``

character
now

*NL*
*NL*
``

continued
the
duke
;

I

by

reception

so
exalted

*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Sancho
had
fixed
and
girthed
Rocinante
's
saddle
,
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
having
got
on
his
back
and
the
duke
mounted
a
fine
horse
,
they
*NL*
placed
the
duchess
in
the
middle
and
set
out
for
the
castle
.
The
duchess
*NL*
desired
Sancho
to
come
to
her
side
,
for
she
found
infinite
enjoyment
in
*NL*
listening
to
his
shrewd
remarks
.
Sancho
required
no
pressing
,
but
pushed
*NL*
himself
in
between
them
and
the
duke
,
who
thought
it
rare
good
fortune
to
*NL*
receive
such
a
knight-errant
and
such
a
homely
squire
in
their
castle
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
TREATS
OF
MANY
AND
GREAT
MATTERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Supreme
was
the
satisfaction
that
Sancho
felt
at
seeing
himself
,
as
it
*NL*
seemed
,
an
established
favourite
with
the
duchess
,
for
he
looked
forward
*NL*
to
finding
in
her
castle
what
he
had
found
in
Don
Diego
's
house
and
in
*NL*
Basilio
's
;
he
was
always
fond
of
good
living
,
and
always
seized
by
the
*NL*
forelock
any
opportunity
of
feasting
himself
whenever
it
presented
*NL*
itself
.
The
history
informs
us
,
then
,
that
before
they
reached
the
*NL*
country
house
or
castle
,
the
duke
went
on
in
advance
and
instructed
all
*NL*
his
servants
how
they
were
to
treat
Don
Quixote
;
and
so
the
instant
he
*NL*
came
up
to
the
castle
gates
with
the
duchess
,
two
lackeys
or
equerries
,
*NL*
clad
in
what
they
call
morning
gowns
of
fine
crimson
satin
reaching
to
*NL*
their
feet
,
hastened
out
,
and
catching
Don
Quixote
in
their
arms
before
*NL*
he
saw
or
heard
them
,
said
to
him
,
``
Your
highness
should
go
and
take
my
*NL*
lady
the
duchess
off
her
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
obeyed
,
and
great
bandying
of
compliments
followed
between
*NL*
the
two
over
the
matter
;
but
in
the
end
the
duchess
's
determination
*NL*
carried
the
day
,
and
she
refused
to
get
down
or
dismount
from
her
palfrey
*NL*
except
in
the
arms
of
the
duke
,
saying
she
did
not
consider
herself
*NL*
worthy
to
impose
so
unnecessary
a
burden
on
so
great
a
knight
.
At
length
*NL*
the
duke
came
out
to
take
her
down
,
and
as
they
entered
a
spacious
court
*NL*
two
fair
damsels
came
forward
and
threw
over
Don
Quixote
's
shoulders
a
*NL*
large
mantle
of
the
finest
scarlet
cloth
,
and
at
the
same
instant
all
the
*NL*
galleries
of
the
court
were
lined
with
the
men-servants
and
*NL*
women-servants
of
the
household
,
crying
,
``
Welcome
,
flower
and
cream
of
*NL*
knight-errantry
!
''
while
all
or
most
of
them
flung
pellets
filled
with
*NL*
scented
water
over
Don
Quixote
and
the
duke
and
duchess
;
at
all
which
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
greatly
astonished
,
and
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
*NL*
thoroughly
felt
and
believed
himself
to
be
a
knight-errant
in
reality
and
*NL*
not
merely
in
fancy
,
now
that
he
saw
himself
treated
in
the
same
way
as
*NL*
he
had
read
of
such
knights
being
treated
in
days
of
yore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
,
deserting
Dapple
,
hung
on
to
the
duchess
and
entered
the
castle
,
*NL*
but
feeling
some
twinges
of
conscience
at
having
left
the
ass
alone
,
he
*NL*
approached
a
respectable
duenna
who
had
come
out
with
the
rest
to
receive
*NL*
the
duchess
,
and
in
a
low
voice
he
said
to
her
,
``
Senora
Gonzalez
,
or
*NL*
however
your
grace
may
be
called
-
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
called
Dona
Rodriguez
de
Grijalba
,
''
replied
the
duenna
;
``
what
is
*NL*
your
will
,
brother
?
''
To
which
Sancho
made
answer
,
``
I
should
be
glad
if
*NL*
your
worship
would
do
me
the
favour
to
go
out
to
the
castle
gate
,
where
*NL*
you
will
find
a
grey
ass
of
mine
;
make
them
,
if
you
please
,
put
him
in
*NL*
the
stable
,
or
put
him
there
yourself
,
for
the
poor
little
beast
is
*NL*
rather
easily
frightened
,
and
can
not
bear
being
alone
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
master
is
as
wise
as
the
man
,
''
said
the
duenna
,
``
we
have
got
a
*NL*
fine
bargain
.
Be
off
with
you
,
brother
,
and
bad
luck
to
you
and
him
who
*NL*
brought
you
here
;
go
,
look
after
your
ass
,
for
we
,
the
duennas
of
this
*NL*
house
,
are
not
used
to
work
of
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
in
troth
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
I
have
heard
my
master
,
who
is
*NL*
the
very
treasure-finder
of
stories
,
telling
the
story
of
Lancelot
when
*NL*
he
came
from
Britain
,
say
that
ladies
waited
upon
him
and
duennas
upon
*NL*
his
hack
;
and
,
if
it
comes
to
my
ass
,
I
would
n't
change
him
for
Senor
*NL*
Lancelot
's
hack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
a
jester
,
brother
,
''
said
the
duenna
,
``
keep
your
drolleries
*NL*
for
some
place
where
they
'll
pass
muster
and
be
paid
for
;
for
you
'll
get
*NL*
nothing
from
me
but
a
fig
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
it
will
be
a
very
ripe
one
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
you
wo
n't
*NL*
lose
the
trick
in
years
by
a
point
too
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Son
of
a
bitch
,
''
said
the
duenna
,
all
aglow
with
anger
,
``
whether
I
'm
old
*NL*
or
not
,
it
's
with
God
I
have
to
reckon
,
not
with
you
,
you
garlic-stuffed
*NL*
scoundrel
!
''
and
she
said
it
so
loud
,
that
the
duchess
heard
it
,
and
*NL*
turning
round
and
seeing
the
duenna
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
,
and
*NL*
her
eyes
flaming
so
,
asked
whom
she
was
wrangling
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
good
fellow
here
,
''
said
the
duenna
,
``
who
has
particularly
*NL*
requested
me
to
go
and
put
an
ass
of
his
that
is
at
the
castle
gate
into
*NL*
the
stable
,
holding
it
up
to
me
as
an
example
that
they
did
the
same
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
where
--
that
some
ladies
waited
on
one
Lancelot
,
and
duennas
on
*NL*
his
hack
;
and
what
is
more
,
to
wind
up
with
,
he
called
me
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
I
should
have
considered
the
greatest
affront
*NL*
that
could
be
offered
me
;
''
and
addressing
Sancho
,
she
said
to
him
,
``
You
*NL*
must
know
,
friend
Sancho
,
that
Dona
Rodriguez
is
very
youthful
,
and
that
*NL*
she
wears
that
hood
more
for
authority
and
custom
's
sake
than
because
of
*NL*
her
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
all
the
rest
of
mine
be
unlucky
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
if
I
meant
it
that
*NL*
way
;
I
only
spoke
because
the
affection
I
have
for
my
ass
is
so
great
,
*NL*
and
I
thought
I
could
not
commend
him
to
a
more
kind-hearted
person
than
*NL*
the
lady
Dona
Rodriguez
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
who
was
listening
,
said
to
him
,
``
Is
this
proper
conversation
*NL*
for
the
place
,
Sancho
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
every
one
must
mention
what
he
wants
wherever
*NL*
he
may
be
;
I
thought
of
Dapple
here
,
and
I
spoke
of
him
here
;
if
I
had
*NL*
thought
of
him
in
the
stable
I
would
have
spoken
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
which
the
duke
observed
,
``
Sancho
is
quite
right
,
and
there
is
no
*NL*
reason
at
all
to
find
fault
with
him
;
Dapple
shall
be
fed
to
his
heart
's
*NL*
content
,
and
Sancho
may
rest
easy
,
for
he
shall
be
treated
like
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
conversation
,
amusing
to
all
except
Don
Quixote
,
was
*NL*
proceeding
,
they
ascended
the
staircase
and
ushered
Don
Quixote
into
a
*NL*
chamber
hung
with
rich
cloth
of
gold
and
brocade
;
six
damsels
relieved
*NL*
him
of
his
armour
and
waited
on
him
like
pages
,
all
of
them
prepared
and
*NL*
instructed
by
the
duke
and
duchess
as
to
what
they
were
to
do
,
and
how
*NL*
they
were
to
treat
Don
Quixote
,
so
that
he
might
see
and
believe
they
*NL*
were
treating
him
like
a
knight-errant
.
When
his
armour
was
removed
,
*NL*
there
stood
Don
Quixote
in
his
tight-fitting
breeches
and
chamois
*NL*
doublet
,
lean
,
lanky
,
and
long
,
with
cheeks
that
seemed
to
be
kissing
*NL*
each
other
inside
;
such
a
figure
,
that
if
the
damsels
waiting
on
him
had
*NL*
not
taken
care
to
check
their
merriment
-LRB-
which
was
one
of
the
particular
*NL*
directions
their
master
and
mistress
had
given
them
-RRB-
,
they
would
have
*NL*
burst
with
laughter
.
They
asked
him
to
let
himself
be
stripped
that
they
*NL*
might
put
a
shirt
on
him
,
but
he
would
not
on
any
account
,
saying
that
*NL*
modesty
became
knights-errant
just
as
much
as
valour
.
However
,
he
said
*NL*
they
might
give
the
shirt
to
Sancho
;
and
shutting
himself
in
with
him
in
*NL*
a
room
where
there
was
a
sumptuous
bed
,
he
undressed
and
put
on
the
*NL*
shirt
;
and
then
,
finding
himself
alone
with
Sancho
,
he
said
to
him
,
``
Tell
*NL*
me
,
thou
new-fledged
buffoon
and
old
booby
,
dost
thou
think
it
right
to
*NL*
offend
and
insult
a
duenna
so
deserving
of
reverence
and
respect
as
that
*NL*
one
just
now
?
Was
that
a
time
to
bethink
thee
of
thy
Dapple
,
or
are
these
*NL*
noble
personages
likely
to
let
the
beasts
fare
badly
when
they
treat
*NL*
their
owners
in
such
elegant
style
?
For
God
's
sake
,
Sancho
,
restrain
*NL*
thyself
,
and
do
n't
show
the
thread
so
as
to
let
them
see
what
a
coarse
,
*NL*
boorish
texture
thou
art
of
.
Remember
,
sinner
that
thou
art
,
the
master
*NL*
is
the
more
esteemed
the
more
respectable
and
well-bred
his
servants
are
;
*NL*
and
that
one
of
the
greatest
advantages
that
princes
have
over
other
men
*NL*
is
that
they
have
servants
as
good
as
themselves
to
wait
on
them
.
Dost
*NL*
thou
not
see
--
shortsighted
being
that
thou
art
,
and
unlucky
mortal
that
I
*NL*
am
!
--
that
if
they
perceive
thee
to
be
a
coarse
clown
or
a
dull
blockhead
,
*NL*
they
will
suspect
me
to
be
some
impostor
or
swindler
?
Nay
,
nay
,
Sancho
*NL*
friend
,
keep
clear
,
oh
,
keep
clear
of
these
stumbling-blocks
;
for
he
who
*NL*
falls
into
the
way
of
being
a
chatterbox
and
droll
,
drops
into
a
wretched
*NL*
buffoon
the
first
time
he
trips
;
bridle
thy
tongue
,
consider
and
weigh
*NL*
thy
words
before
they
escape
thy
mouth
,
and
bear
in
mind
we
are
now
in
*NL*
quarters
whence
,
by
God
's
help
,
and
the
strength
of
my
arm
,
we
shall
come
*NL*
forth
mightily
advanced
in
fame
and
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
promised
him
with
much
earnestness
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
,
and
to
*NL*
bite
off
his
tongue
before
he
uttered
a
word
that
was
not
altogether
to
*NL*
the
purpose
and
well
considered
,
and
told
him
he
might
make
his
mind
easy
*NL*
on
that
point
,
for
it
should
never
be
discovered
through
him
what
they
*NL*
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
dressed
himself
,
put
on
his
baldric
with
his
sword
,
threw
the
*NL*
scarlet
mantle
over
his
shoulders
,
placed
on
his
head
a
montera
of
green
*NL*
satin
that
the
damsels
had
given
him
,
and
thus
arrayed
passed
out
into
*NL*
the
large
room
,
where
he
found
the
damsels
drawn
up
in
double
file
,
the
*NL*
same
number
on
each
side
,
all
with
the
appliances
for
washing
the
hands
,
*NL*
which
they
presented
to
him
with
profuse
obeisances
and
ceremonies
.
Then
*NL*
came
twelve
pages
,
together
with
the
seneschal
,
to
lead
him
to
dinner
,
as
*NL*
his
hosts
were
already
waiting
for
him
.
They
placed
him
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
them
,
and
with
much
pomp
and
stateliness
they
conducted
him
into
another
*NL*
room
,
where
there
was
a
sumptuous
table
laid
with
but
four
covers
.
The
*NL*
duchess
and
the
duke
came
out
to
the
door
of
the
room
to
receive
him
,
and
*NL*
with
them
a
grave
ecclesiastic
,
one
of
those
who
rule
noblemen
's
houses
;
*NL*
one
of
those
who
,
not
being
born
magnates
themselves
,
never
know
how
to
*NL*
teach
those
who
are
how
to
behave
as
such
;
one
of
those
who
would
have
*NL*
the
greatness
of
great
folk
measured
by
their
own
narrowness
of
mind
;
one
*NL*
of
those
who
,
when
they
try
to
introduce
economy
into
the
household
they
*NL*
rule
,
lead
it
into
meanness
.
One
of
this
sort
,
I
say
,
must
have
been
the
*NL*
grave
churchman
who
came
out
with
the
duke
and
duchess
to
receive
Don
*NL*
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
vast
number
of
polite
speeches
were
exchanged
,
and
at
length
,
taking
*NL*
Don
Quixote
between
them
,
they
proceeded
to
sit
down
to
table
.
The
duke
*NL*
pressed
Don
Quixote
to
take
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
,
though
he
*NL*
refused
,
the
entreaties
of
the
duke
were
so
urgent
that
he
had
to
accept
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ecclesiastic
took
his
seat
opposite
to
him
,
and
the
duke
and
duchess
*NL*
those
at
the
sides
.
All
this
time
Sancho
stood
by
,
gaping
with
amazement
*NL*
at
the
honour
he
saw
shown
to
his
master
by
these
illustrious
persons
;
*NL*
and
observing
all
the
ceremonious
pressing
that
had
passed
between
the
*NL*
duke
and
Don
Quixote
to
induce
him
to
take
his
seat
at
the
head
of
the
*NL*
table
,
he
said
,
``
If
your
worship
will
give
me
leave
I
will
tell
you
a
*NL*
story
of
what
happened
in
my
village
about
this
matter
of
seats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
Sancho
said
this
Don
Quixote
trembled
,
making
sure
that
he
was
*NL*
about
to
say
something
foolish
.
Sancho
glanced
at
him
,
and
guessing
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
said
,
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
my
going
astray
,
senor
,
or
saying
*NL*
anything
that
wo
n't
be
pat
to
the
purpose
;
I
have
n't
forgotten
the
advice
*NL*
your
worship
gave
me
just
now
about
talking
much
or
little
,
well
or
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
recollection
of
anything
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
say
what
*NL*
thou
wilt
,
only
say
it
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
what
I
am
going
to
say
is
so
true
that
my
*NL*
master
Don
Quixote
,
who
is
here
present
,
will
keep
me
from
lying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lie
as
much
as
thou
wilt
for
all
I
care
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
*NL*
I
am
not
going
to
stop
thee
,
but
consider
what
thou
art
going
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
so
considered
and
reconsidered
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
the
*NL*
bell-ringer
's
in
a
safe
berth
;
as
will
be
seen
by
what
follows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
well
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
your
highnesses
would
order
*NL*
them
to
turn
out
this
idiot
,
for
he
will
talk
a
heap
of
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
life
of
the
duke
,
Sancho
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
me
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
''
said
the
duchess
;
``
I
am
very
fond
of
him
,
for
I
know
he
is
very
*NL*
discreet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Discreet
be
the
days
of
your
holiness
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
the
good
*NL*
opinion
you
have
of
my
wit
,
though
there
's
none
in
me
;
but
the
story
I
*NL*
want
to
tell
is
this
.
There
was
an
invitation
given
by
a
gentleman
of
my
*NL*
town
,
a
very
rich
one
,
and
one
of
quality
,
for
he
was
one
of
the
Alamos
*NL*
of
Medina
del
Campo
,
and
married
to
Dona
Mencia
de
Quinones
,
the
daughter
*NL*
of
Don
Alonso
de
Maranon
,
Knight
of
the
Order
of
Santiago
,
that
was
*NL*
drowned
at
the
Herradura
--
him
there
was
that
quarrel
about
years
ago
in
*NL*
our
village
,
that
my
master
Don
Quixote
was
mixed
up
in
,
to
the
best
of
*NL*
my
belief
,
that
Tomasillo
the
scapegrace
,
the
son
of
Balbastro
the
smith
,
*NL*
was
wounded
in
.
--
Is
n't
all
this
true
,
master
mine
?
As
you
live
,
say
so
,
*NL*
that
these
gentlefolk
may
not
take
me
for
some
lying
chatterer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
,
''
said
the
ecclesiastic
,
``
I
take
you
to
be
more
a
chatterer
than
*NL*
a
liar
;
but
I
do
n't
know

*NL*
``

Sancho

said
Don

,
*NL*
``
that
I
have
no
choice

to

thou
must
be
telling
the

go
on

the

short

thou
art
taking

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not

said
the
duchess
;

on
the
contrary

he
is
to
tell
it

not

finish
it
these
six

took
so
many

me
the

pleasantest
I
ever
spent

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then

sirs
,
I
say
,

continued
Sancho
,
``
that
this

I
know

I

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
on

the

*NL*
``
I

Sancho
;

so
I
say
*NL*
this
labourer

coming

spoke

invited
him

his

now
dead

more
by

death

an

they
say
;

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
it
so
happened

said
Sancho
,
``
that
as
the

them
were

going

down

I
think
I
can
see
them
now
plainer
than

''
*NL*
*NL*
Great
was
the
enjoyment
the
duke
and
duchess
derived
from
the
irritation
*NL*
the
worthy
churchman
showed
at
the
long-winded
,
halting
way
Sancho
had
of
*NL*
telling
his
story
,
while
Don
Quixote
was
chafing
with
rage
and
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
as
I
was
saying
,
''
continued
Sancho
,
``
as
the
pair
of
them
were
going
*NL*
to
sit
down
to
table
,
as
I
said
,
the
labourer
insisted
upon
the
*NL*
gentleman
's
taking
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
the
gentleman
insisted
upon
*NL*
the
labourer
's
taking
it
,
as
his
orders
should
be
obeyed
in
his
house
;
*NL*
but
the
labourer
,
who
plumed
himself
on
his
politeness
and
good
breeding
,
*NL*
would
not
on
any
account
,
until
the
gentleman
,
out
of
patience
,
putting
*NL*
his
hands
on
his
shoulders
,
compelled
him
by
force
to
sit
down
,
saying
,
*NL*
`
Sit
down
,
you
stupid
lout
,
for
wherever
I
sit
will
be
the
head
to
you

*NL*
and
that
's
the
story
,
and

troth
,
I
think
it
has
n't
been
brought
in
amiss
*NL*
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
turned
all
colours
,
which
,
on
his
sunburnt
face
,
mottled
it
*NL*
till
it
looked
like
jasper
.
The
duke
and
duchess
suppressed
their
*NL*
laughter
so
as
not
altogether
to
mortify
Don
Quixote
,
for
they
saw
*NL*
through
Sancho
's
impertinence
;
and
to
change
the
conversation
,
and
keep
*NL*
Sancho
from
uttering
more
absurdities
,
the
duchess
asked
Don
Quixote
what
*NL*
news
he
had
of
the
lady
Dulcinea
,
and
if
he
had
sent
her
any
presents
of
*NL*
giants
or
miscreants
lately
,
for
he
could
not
but
have
vanquished
a
good
*NL*
many
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
Senora
,
my
misfortunes
,
though
they
had
a
*NL*
beginning
,
will
never
have
an
end
.
I
have
vanquished
giants
and
I
have
*NL*
sent
her
caitiffs
and
miscreants
;
but
where
are
they
to
find
her
if
she
*NL*
is
enchanted
and
turned
into
the
most
ill-favoured
peasant
wench
that
can
*NL*
be
imagined
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Sancho
Panza
;
``
to
me
she
seems
the
fairest
creature
*NL*
in
the
world
;
at
any
rate
,
in
nimbleness
and
jumping
she
wo
n't
give
in
to
*NL*
a
tumbler
;
by
my
faith
,
senora
duchess
,
she
leaps
from
the
ground
on
to
*NL*
the
back
of
an
ass
like
a
cat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
her
enchanted

Sancho
?

asked
the
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

seen
her
!

said
Sancho
;
``
why
,
who
the
devil
was
it
but
myself
that
*NL*
first
thought
of
the

business
?
She
is
as
much
enchanted
as
my
*NL*
father

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ecclesiastic
,
when
he
heard
them
talking
of
giants
and
caitiffs
and
*NL*
enchantments
,
began
to
suspect
that
this
must
be
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
whose
story
the
duke
was
always
reading
;
and
he
had
himself
often
*NL*
reproved
him
for
it
,
telling
him
it
was
foolish
to
read
such
fooleries
;
*NL*
and
becoming
convinced
that
his
suspicion
was
correct
,
addressing
the
*NL*
duke
,
he
said
very
angrily
to
him
,
``
Senor
,
your
excellence
will
have
to
*NL*
give
account
to
God
for
what
this
good
man
does
.
This
Don
Quixote
,
or
Don
*NL*
Simpleton
,
or
whatever
his
name
is
,
can
not
,
I
imagine
,
be
such
a
*NL*
blockhead
as
your
excellence
would
have
him
,
holding
out
encouragement
to
*NL*
him
to
go
on
with
his
vagaries
and
follies
.
''
Then
turning
to
address
Don
*NL*
Quixote
he
said
,
``
And
you
,
num-skull
,
who
put
it
into
your
head
that
you
*NL*
are
a
knight-errant
,
and
vanquish
giants
and
capture
miscreants
?
Go
your
*NL*
ways
in
a
good
hour
,
and
in
a
good
hour
be
it
said
to
you
.
Go
home
and
*NL*
bring
up
your
children
if
you
have
any
,
and
attend
to
your
business
,
and
*NL*
give
over
going
wandering
about
the
world
,
gaping
and
making
a
*NL*
laughing-stock
of
yourself
to
all
who
know
you
and
all
who
do
n't
.
Where
,
*NL*
in
heaven
's
name
,
have
you
discovered
that
there
are
or
ever
were
*NL*
knights-errant

Where
are
there
giants

miscreants
in
La

,

enchanted
Dulcineas

the
rest

silly
things

*NL*
tell
about
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
listened
attentively
to
the
reverend
gentleman
's
words
,
and
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
perceived
he
had
done
speaking
,
regardless
of
the
presence
*NL*
of
the
duke
and
duchess
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
angry
looks
and
an
*NL*
agitated
countenance
,
and
said
--
But
the
reply
deserves
a
chapter
to
*NL*
itself

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
REPLY
DON
QUIXOTE
GAVE
HIS
CENSURER
,
WITH
OTHER
INCIDENTS
,
GRAVE
*NL*
AND
DROLL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
then
,
having
risen
to
his
feet
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
*NL*
like
a
man
dosed
with
mercury
,
said
in
a
hurried
,
agitated
voice
,
``
The
*NL*
place
I
am
in
,
the
presence
in
which
I
stand
,
and
the
respect
I
have
and
*NL*
always
have
had
for
the
profession
to
which
your
worship
belongs
,
hold
*NL*
and
bind
the
hands
of
my
just
indignation
;
and
as
well
for
these
reasons
*NL*
as
because
I
know
,
as
everyone
knows
,
that
a
gownsman
's
weapon
is
the
*NL*
same
as
a
woman
's
,
the
tongue
,
I
will
with
mine
engage
in
equal
combat
*NL*
with
your
worship
,
from
whom
one
might
have
expected
good
advice
instead
*NL*
of
foul
abuse
.
Pious
,
well-meant
reproof
requires
a
different
demeanour
*NL*
and
arguments
of
another
sort
;
at
any
rate
,
to
have
reproved
me
in
*NL*
public
,
and
so
roughly
,
exceeds
the
bounds
of
proper
reproof
,
for
that
*NL*
comes
better
with
gentleness
than
with
rudeness
;
and
it
is
not
seemly
to
*NL*
call
the
sinner
roundly
blockhead
and
booby
,
without
knowing
anything
of
*NL*
the
sin
that
is
reproved
.
Come
,
tell
me
,
for
which
of
the
stupidities
you
*NL*
have
observed
in
me
do
you
condemn
and
abuse
me
,
and
bid
me
go
home
and
*NL*
look
after
my
house
and
wife
and
children
,
without
knowing
whether
I
have
*NL*
any
?
Is
nothing
more
needed
than
to
get
a
footing
,
by
hook
or
by
crook
,
*NL*
in
other
people
's
houses
to
rule
over
the
masters
-LRB-
and
that
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
after
having
been
brought
up
in
all
the
straitness
of
some
seminary
,
and
*NL*
without
having
ever
seen
more
of
the
world
than
may
lie
within
twenty
or
*NL*
thirty
leagues
round
-RRB-
,
to
fit
one
to
lay
down
the
law
rashly
for
*NL*
chivalry
,
and
pass
judgment
on
knights-errant
?
Is
it
,
haply
,
an
idle
*NL*
occupation
,
or
is
the
time
ill-spent
that
is
spent
in
roaming
the
world
*NL*
in
quest
,
not
of
its
enjoyments
,
but
of
those
arduous
toils
whereby
the
*NL*
good
mount
upwards
to
the
abodes
of
everlasting
life
?
If
gentlemen
,
great
*NL*
lords
,
nobles
,
men
of
high
birth
,
were
to
rate
me
as
a
fool
I
should
take
*NL*
it
as
an
irreparable
insult
;
but
I
care
not
a
farthing
if
clerks
who
have
*NL*
never
entered
upon
or
trod
the
paths
of
chivalry
should
think
me
foolish
.
*NL*
Knight
I
am
,
and
knight
I
will
die
,
if
such
be
the
pleasure
of
the
Most
*NL*
High
.
Some
take
the
broad
road
of
overweening
ambition
;
others
that
of
*NL*
mean
and
servile
flattery
;
others
that
of
deceitful
hypocrisy
,
and
some
*NL*
that
of
true
religion
;
but
I
,
led
by
my
star
,
follow
the
narrow
path
of
*NL*
knight-errantry
,
and
in
pursuit
of
that
calling
I
despise
wealth
,
but
not
*NL*
honour
.
I
have
redressed
injuries
,
righted
wrongs
,
punished
insolences
,
*NL*
vanquished
giants
,
and
crushed
monsters
;
I
am
in
love
,
for
no
other
*NL*
reason
than
that
it
is
incumbent
on
knights-errant
to
be
so
;
but
though
I
*NL*
am
,
I
am
no
carnal-minded
lover
,
but
one
of
the
chaste
,
platonic
sort
.
My
*NL*
intentions
are
always
directed
to
worthy
ends
,
to
do
good
to
all
and
evil
*NL*
to
none
;
and
if
he
who
means
this
,
does
this
,
and
makes
this
his
practice
*NL*
deserves
to
be
called
a
fool
,
it
is
for
your
highnesses
to
say
,
O
most
*NL*
excellent
duke
and
duchess

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
by
God

cried
Sancho
;
``

no
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Sancho
my
friend

certainly
not

said
the
duke
,
``
for
in

I
confer
upon

the
government

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
down

said
Don

,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
obeyed
,
and
on
seeing
this
the
ecclesiastic
stood
up
from
table
*NL*
completely
out
of
temper
,
exclaiming
,
``
By
the

can
not
remedy

and
without
uttering
another
word
,
or
*NL*
eating
another
morsel
,
he
went
off
,
the
entreaties
of
the
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
being
entirely
unavailing
to
stop
him
;
not
that
the
duke
said
*NL*
much
to
him
,
for
he
could
not
,
because
of
the
laughter
his
uncalled-for

anger
provoked

*NL*
When
he
had
done
laughing

he
said
to

it
may
look
*NL*
like
an
offence
,
is
not
so
at
all
,
for
,
as
women
can
give
no
offence
,
no
*NL*
more
can
ecclesiastics
,
as
you
very
well
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
the
reason
is
,
that
he
who
is
not
*NL*
liable
to
offence
can
not
give
offence
to
anyone
.
Women
,
children
,
and
*NL*
ecclesiastics
,
as
they
can
not
defend
themselves
,
though
they
may
receive
*NL*
offence
can
not
be
insulted
,
because
between
the
offence
and
the
insult
*NL*
there
is
,
as
your
excellence
very
well
knows
,
this
difference
:
the
insult
*NL*
comes
from
one
who
is
capable
of
offering
it
,
and
does
so
,
and
maintains
*NL*
it
;
the
offence
may
come
from
any
quarter
without
carrying
insult
.
To
*NL*
take
an
example
:
a
man
is
standing
unsuspectingly
in
the
street
and
ten
*NL*
others
come
up
armed
and
beat
him
;
he
draws
his
sword
and
quits
himself
*NL*
like
a
man
,
but
the
number
of
his
antagonists
makes
it
impossible
for
him
*NL*
to
effect
his
purpose
and
avenge
himself
;
this
man
suffers
an
offence
but
*NL*
not
an
insult
.
Another
example
will
make
the
same
thing
plain
:
a
man
is
*NL*
standing
with
his
back
turned
,
another
comes
up
and
strikes
him
,
and
*NL*
after
striking
him
takes
to
flight
,
without
waiting
an
instant
,
and
the
*NL*
other
pursues
him
but
does
not
overtake
him
;
he
who
received
the
blow
*NL*
received
an
offence
,
but
not
an
insult
,
because
an
insult
must
be
*NL*
maintained
.
If
he
who
struck
him
,
though
he
did
so
sneakingly
and
*NL*
treacherously
,
had
drawn
his
sword
and
stood
and
faced
him
,
then
he
who
*NL*
had
been
struck
would
have
received
offence
and
insult
at
the
same
time
;
*NL*
offence
because
he
was
struck
treacherously
,
insult
because
he
who
struck
*NL*
him
maintained
what
he
had
done
,
standing
his
ground
without
taking
to
*NL*
flight
.
And
so
,
according
to
the
laws
of
the
accursed
duel
,
I
may
have
*NL*
received
offence
,
but
not
insult
,
for
neither
women
nor
children
can
*NL*
maintain
it
,
nor
can
they
wound
,
nor
have
they
any
way
of
standing
their
*NL*
ground
,
and
it
is
just
the
same
with
those
connected
with
religion
;
for
*NL*
these
three
sorts
of
persons
are
without
arms
offensive
or
defensive
,
and
*NL*
so
,
though
naturally
they
are
bound
to
defend
themselves
,
they
have
no
*NL*
right
to
offend
anybody
;
and
though
I
said
just
now
I
might
have
received
*NL*
offence
,
I
say
now
certainly
not
,
for
he
who
can
not
receive
an
insult
can
*NL*
still
less
give
one
;
for
which
reasons
I
ought
not
to
feel
,
nor
do
I
*NL*
feel
,
aggrieved
at
what
that
good
man
said
to
me
;
I
only
wish
he
had
*NL*
stayed
a
little
longer
,
that
I
might
have
shown
him
the
mistake
he
makes
*NL*
in
supposing
and
maintaining
that
there
are
not
and
never
have
been
any
*NL*
knights-errant
in
the
world
;
had
Amadis
or
any
of
his
countless
*NL*
descendants
heard
him
say
as
much
,
I
am
sure
it
would
not
have
gone
well
*NL*
with
his
worship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
my
oath
of
that
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
they
would
have
given
him
a
*NL*
slash
that
would
have
slit
him
down
from
top
to
toe
like
a
pomegranate
or
*NL*
a
ripe
melon
;
they
were
likely
fellows
to
put
up
with
jokes
of
that
sort
!
*NL*
By
my
faith
,
I
'm
certain
if
Reinaldos
of
Montalvan
had
heard
the
little
*NL*
man
's
words
he
would
have
given
him
such
a
spank
on
the
mouth
that
he
*NL*
would
n't
have
spoken
for
the
next
three
years
;
ay
,
let
him
tackle
them
,
*NL*
and
he
'll
see
how
he
'll
get
out
of
their
hands
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
,
as
she
listened
to
Sancho
,
was
ready
to
die
with
laughter
,
*NL*
and
in
her
own
mind
she
set
him
down
as
droller
and
madder
than
his
*NL*
master
;
and
there
were
a
good
many
just
then
who
were
of
the
same
*NL*
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
finally
grew
calm
,
and
dinner
came
to
an
end
,
and
as
the
*NL*
cloth
was
removed
four
damsels
came
in
,
one
of
them
with
a
silver
basin
,
*NL*
another
with
a
jug
also
of
silver
,
a
third
with
two
fine
white
towels
on
*NL*
her
shoulder
,
and
the
fourth
with
her
arms
bared
to
the
elbows
,
and
in
*NL*
her
white
hands
-LRB-
for
white
they
certainly
were
-RRB-
a
round
ball
of
Naples
*NL*
soap
.
The
one
with
the
basin
approached
,
and
with
arch
composure
and
*NL*
impudence
,
thrust
it
under
Don
Quixote
's
chin
,
who
,
wondering
at
such
a
*NL*
ceremony
,
said
never
a
word
,
supposing
it
to
be
the
custom
of
that
*NL*
country
to
wash
beards
instead
of
hands
;
he
therefore
stretched
his
out
*NL*
as
far
as
he
could
,
and
at
the
same
instant
the
jug
began
to
pour
and
the
*NL*
damsel
with
the
soap
rubbed
his
beard
briskly
,
raising
snow-flakes
,
for
*NL*
the
soap
lather
was
no
less
white
,
not
only
over
the
beard
,
but
all
over
*NL*
the
face
,
and
over
the
eyes
of
the
submissive
knight
,
so
that
they
were
*NL*
perforce
obliged
to
keep
shut
.
The
duke
and
duchess
,
who
had
not
known
*NL*
anything
about
this
,
waited
to
see
what
came
of
this
strange
washing
.
The
*NL*
barber
damsel
,
when
she
had
him
a
hand
's
breadth
deep
in
lather
,
*NL*
pretended
that
there
was
no
more
water
,
and
bade
the
one
with
the
jug
go
*NL*
and
fetch
some
,
while
Senor
Don
Quixote
waited
.
She
did
so
,
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
left
the
strangest
and
most
ludicrous
figure
that
could
be
*NL*
imagined
.
All
those
present
,
and
there
were
a
good
many
,
were
watching
*NL*
him
,
and
as
they
saw
him
there
with
half
a
yard
of
neck
,
and
that
*NL*
uncommonly
brown
,
his
eyes
shut
,
and
his
beard
full
of
soap
,
it
was
a
*NL*
great
wonder
,
and
only
by
great
discretion
,
that
they
were
able
to
*NL*
restrain
their
laughter
.
The
damsels
,
the
concocters
of
the
joke
,
kept
*NL*
their
eyes
down
,
not
daring
to
look
at
their
master
and
mistress
;
and
as
*NL*
for
them
,
laughter
and
anger
struggled
within
them
,
and
they
knew
not
*NL*
what
to
do
,
whether
to
punish
the
audacity
of
the
girls
,
or
to
reward
*NL*
them
for
the
amusement
they
had
received
from
seeing
Don
Quixote
in
such
*NL*
a
plight
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
damsel
with
the
jug
returned
and
they
made
an
end
of
*NL*
washing
Don
Quixote
,
and
the
one
who
carried
the
towels
very
deliberately
*NL*
wiped
him
and
dried
him
;
and
all
four
together
making
him
a
profound
*NL*
obeisance
and
curtsey
,
they
were
about
to
go
,
when
the
duke
,
lest
Don
*NL*
Quixote
should
see
through
the
joke
,
called
out
to
the
one
with
the
basin
*NL*
saying
,
``
Come
and
wash
me
,
and
take
care
that
there
is
water
enough
.
''
The
*NL*
girl
,
sharp-witted
and
prompt
,
came
and
placed
the
basin
for
the
duke
as
*NL*
she
had
done
for
Don
Quixote
,
and
they
soon
had
him
well
soaped
and
*NL*
washed
,
and
having
wiped
him
dry
they
made
their
obeisance
and
retired
.
*NL*
It
appeared
afterwards
that
the
duke
had
sworn
that
if
they
had
not
*NL*
washed
him
as
they
had
Don
Quixote
he
would
have
punished
them
for
their
*NL*
impudence
,
which
they
adroitly
atoned
for
by
soaping
him
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
observed
the
ceremony
of
the
washing
very
attentively
,
and
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
God
bless
me
,
if
it
were
only
the
custom
in
this
country
to
*NL*
wash
squires
'
beards
too
as
well
as
knights
'
.
For
by
God
and
upon
my
soul
*NL*
I
want
it
badly
;
and
if
they
gave
me
a
scrape
of
the
razor
besides
I
'd
*NL*
take
it
as
a
still
greater
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
saying
to
yourself
,
Sancho
?
''
asked
the
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
saying
,
senora
,
''
he
replied
,
``
that
in
the
courts
of
other
princes
,
*NL*
when
the
cloth
is
taken
away
,
I
have
always
heard
say
they
give
water
for
*NL*
the
hands
,
but
not
lye
for
the
beard
;
and
that
shows
it
is
good
to
live
*NL*
long
that
you
may
see
much
;
to
be
sure
,
they
say
too
that
he
who
lives
a
*NL*
long
life
must
undergo
much
evil
,
though
to
undergo
a
washing
of
that
*NL*
sort
is
pleasure
rather
than
pain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
friend
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duchess
;
``
I
will
take
care
*NL*
that
my
damsels
wash
you
,
and
even
put
you
in
the
tub
if
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
content
with
the
beard
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
at
any
rate
for
the
*NL*
present
;
and
as
for
the
future
,
God
has
decreed
what
is
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Attend
to
worthy
Sancho
's
request
,
seneschal
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
and
do
*NL*
exactly
what
he
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
seneschal
replied
that
Senor
Sancho
should
be
obeyed
in
everything
;
*NL*
and
with
that
he
went
away
to
dinner
and
took
Sancho
along
with
him
,
*NL*
while
the
duke
and
duchess
and
Don
Quixote
remained
at
table
discussing
a
*NL*
great
variety
of
things
,
but
all
bearing
on
the
calling
of
arms
and
*NL*
knight-errantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
begged
Don
Quixote
,
as
he
seemed
to
have
a
retentive
memory
,
*NL*
to
describe
and
portray
to
her
the
beauty
and
features
of
the
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
for
,
judging
by
what
fame
trumpeted
abroad
of
her
*NL*
beauty
,
she
felt
sure
she
must
be
the
fairest
creature
in
the
world
,
nay
,
*NL*
in
all
La
Mancha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
sighed
on
hearing
the
duchess
's
request
,
and
said
,
``
If
I
*NL*
could
pluck
out
my
heart
,
and
lay
it
on
a
plate
on
this
table
here
before
*NL*
your
highness
's
eyes
,
it
would
spare
my
tongue
the
pain
of
telling
what
*NL*
can
hardly
be
thought
of
,
for
in
it
your
excellence
would
see
her
*NL*
portrayed
in
full
.
But
why
should
I
attempt
to
depict
and
describe
in
*NL*
detail
,
and
feature
by
feature
,
the
beauty
of
the
peerless
Dulcinea
,
the
*NL*
burden
being
one
worthy
of
other
shoulders
than
mine
,
an
enterprise
*NL*
wherein
the
pencils
of
Parrhasius
,
Timantes
,
and
Apelles
,
and
the
graver
*NL*
of
Lysippus
ought
to
be
employed
,
to
paint
it
in
pictures
and
carve
it
in
*NL*
marble
and
bronze
,
and
Ciceronian
and
Demosthenian
eloquence
to
sound
its
*NL*
praises
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
Demosthenian
mean
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
?
''
said
the
duchess
;
``
it
*NL*
is
a
word
I
never
heard
in
all
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Demosthenian
eloquence
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
means
the
eloquence
of
*NL*
Demosthenes
,
as
Ciceronian
means
that
of
Cicero
,
who
were
the
two
most
*NL*
eloquent
orators
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
the
duke
;
``
you
must
have
lost
your
wits
to
ask
such
a
*NL*
question
.
Nevertheless
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
would
greatly
gratify
us
if
he
*NL*
would
depict
her
to
us
;
for
never
fear
,
even
in
an
outline
or
sketch
she
*NL*
will
be
something
to
make
the
fairest
envious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
do
so
certainly
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
had
she
not
been
blurred
to
*NL*
my
mind
's
eye
by
the
misfortune
that
fell
upon
her
a
short
time
since
,
*NL*
one
of
such
a
nature
that
I
am
more
ready
to
weep
over
it
than
to
*NL*
describe
it
.
For
your
highnesses
must
know
that
,
going
a
few
days
back
to
*NL*
kiss
her
hands
and
receive
her
benediction
,
approbation
,
and
permission
*NL*
for
this
third
sally
,
I
found
her
altogether
a
different
being
from
the
*NL*
one
I
sought
;
I
found
her
enchanted
and
changed
from
a
princess
into
a
*NL*
peasant
,
from
fair
to
foul
,
from
an
angel
into
a
devil
,
from
fragrant
to
*NL*
pestiferous
,
from
refined
to
clownish
,
from
a
dignified
lady
into
a
*NL*
jumping
tomboy
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
from
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
into
a
coarse
*NL*
Sayago
wench
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
me
!
''
said
the
duke
aloud
at
this
,
``
who
can
have
done
the
world
*NL*
such
an
injury
?
Who
can
have
robbed
it
of
the
beauty
that
gladdened
it
,
*NL*
of
the
grace
and
gaiety
that
charmed
it
,
of
the
modesty
that
shed
a
*NL*
lustre
upon
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
``
who
could
it
be
but
some
malignant
enchanter
*NL*
of
the
many
that
persecute
me
out
of
envy
--
that
accursed
race
born
into
*NL*
the
world
to
obscure
and
bring
to
naught
the
achievements
of
the
good
,
*NL*
and
glorify
and
exalt
the
deeds
of
the
wicked
?
Enchanters
have
persecuted
*NL*
me
,
enchanters
persecute
me
still
,
and
enchanters
will
continue
to
*NL*
persecute
me
until
they
have
sunk
me
and
my
lofty
chivalry
in
the
deep
*NL*
abyss
of
oblivion
;
and
they
injure
and
wound
me
where
they
know
I
feel
it
*NL*
most
.
For
to
deprive
a
knight-errant
of
his
lady
is
to
deprive
him
of
the
*NL*
eyes
he
sees
with
,
of
the
sun
that
gives
him
light
,
of
the
food
whereby
*NL*
he
lives
.
Many
a
time
before
have
I
said
it
,
and
I
say
it
now
once
more
,
*NL*
a
knight-errant
without
a
lady
is
like
a
tree
without
leaves

a
building

without
a
foundation

a
shadow
without
the
body
that
causes
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
denying
it
,
''
said
the
duchess
;
``
but
still
,
if
we
are
to
*NL*
believe
the
history
of
Don
Quixote
that
has
come
out
here
lately
with
*NL*
general
applause
,
it
is
to
be
inferred
from
it
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
that
*NL*
you
never
saw
the
lady
Dulcinea
,
and
that
the
said
lady
is
nothing
in
the
*NL*
world
but
an
imaginary
lady
,
one
that
you
yourself
begot
and
gave
birth
*NL*
to
in
your
brain
,
and
adorned
with
whatever
charms
and
perfections
you
*NL*
chose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
that
point
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
God
*NL*
knows
whether
there
be
any
Dulcinea
or
not
in
the
world
,
or
whether
she
*NL*
is
imaginary
or
not
imaginary
;
these
are
things
the
proof
of
which
must
*NL*
not
be
pushed
to
extreme
lengths
.
I
have
not
begotten
nor
given
birth
to
*NL*
my
lady
,
though
I
behold
her
as
she
needs
must
be
,
a
lady
who
contains
in
*NL*
herself
all
the
qualities
to
make
her
famous
throughout
the
world
,
*NL*
beautiful
without
blemish
,
dignified
without
haughtiness
,
tender
and
yet
*NL*
modest
,
gracious
from
courtesy
and
courteous
from
good
breeding
,
and
*NL*
lastly
,
of
exalted
lineage
,
because
beauty
shines
forth
and
excels
with
a
*NL*
higher
degree
of
perfection
upon
good
blood
than
in
the
fair
of
lowly
*NL*
birth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
duke
;
``
but
Senor
Don
Quixote
will
give
me
leave
*NL*
to
say
what
I
am
constrained
to
say
by
the
story
of
his
exploits
that
I
*NL*
have
read
,
from
which
it
is
to
be
inferred
that
,
granting
there
is
a
*NL*
Dulcinea
in
El
Toboso
,
or
out
of
it
,
and
that
she
is
in
the
highest
*NL*
degree
beautiful
as
you
have
described
her
to
us
,
as
regards
the
*NL*
loftiness
of
her
lineage
she
is
not
on
a
par
with
the
Orianas
,
*NL*
Alastrajareas
,
Madasimas
,
or
others
of
that
sort
,
with
whom
,
as
you
well
*NL*
know
,
the
histories
abound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
that
I
may
reply
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
Dulcinea
is
the
daughter
*NL*
of
her
own
works
,
and
that
virtues
rectify
blood
,
and
that
lowly
virtue
*NL*
is
more
to
be
regarded
and
esteemed
than
exalted
vice
.
Dulcinea
,
besides
,
*NL*
has
that
within
her
that
may
raise
her
to
be
a
crowned
and
sceptred
*NL*
queen
;
for
the
merit
of
a
fair
and
virtuous
woman
is
capable
of
*NL*
performing
greater
miracles
;
and
virtually
,
though
not
formally
,
she
has
*NL*
in
herself
higher
fortunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
protest
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
that
in
all
you
say
,
*NL*
you
go
most
cautiously
and
lead
in
hand
,
as
the
saying
is
;
henceforth
I
*NL*
will
believe
myself
,
and
I
will
take
care
that
everyone
in
my
house
*NL*
believes
,
even
my
lord
the
duke
if
needs
be
,
that
there
is
a
Dulcinea
in
*NL*
El
Toboso
,
and
that
she
is
living
to-day
,
and
that
she
is
beautiful
and
*NL*
nobly
born
and
deserves
to
have
such
a
knight
as
Senor
Don
Quixote
in
her
*NL*
service
,
and
that
is
the
highest
praise
that
it
is
in
my
power
to
give
*NL*
her
or
that
I
can
think
of
.
But
I
can
not
help
entertaining
a
doubt
,
and
*NL*
having
a
certain
grudge
against
Sancho
Panza
;
the
doubt
is
this
,
that
the
*NL*
aforesaid
history
declares
that
the
said
Sancho
Panza
,
when
he
carried
a
*NL*
letter
on
your
worship
's
behalf
to
the
said
lady
Dulcinea
,
found
her
*NL*
sifting
a
sack
of
wheat
;
and
more
by
token
it
says
it
was
red
wheat
;
a
*NL*
thing
which
makes
me
doubt
the
loftiness
of
her
lineage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Don
Quixote
made
answer
,
``
Senora
,
your
highness
must
know
that
*NL*
everything
or
almost
everything
that
happens
me
transcends
the
ordinary
*NL*
limits
of
what
happens
to
other
knights-errant
;
whether
it
be
that
it
is
*NL*
directed
by
the
inscrutable
will
of
destiny
,
or
by
the
malice
of
some
*NL*
jealous
enchanter
.
Now
it
is
an
established
fact
that
all
or
most
famous
*NL*
knights-errant
have
some
special
gift
,
one
that
of
being
proof
against
*NL*
enchantment
,
another
that
of
being
made
of
such
invulnerable
flesh
that
*NL*
he
can
not
be
wounded
,
as
was
the
famous
Roland
,
one
of
the
twelve
peers
*NL*
of
France
,
of
whom
it
is
related
that
he
could
not
be
wounded
except
in
*NL*
the
sole
of
his
left
foot
,
and
that
it
must
be
with
the
point
of
a
stout
*NL*
pin
and
not
with
any
other
sort
of
weapon
whatever
;
and
so
,
when
Bernardo
*NL*
del
Carpio
slew
him
at
Roncesvalles
,
finding
that
he
could
not
wound
him
*NL*
with
steel
,
he
lifted
him
up
from
the
ground
in
his
arms
and
strangled
*NL*
him
,
calling
to
mind
seasonably
the
death
which
Hercules
inflicted
on
*NL*
Antaeus
,
the
fierce
giant
that
they
say
was
the
son
of
Terra
.
I
would
*NL*
infer
from
what
I
have
mentioned
that
perhaps
I
may
have
some
gift
of
*NL*
this
kind
,
not
that
of
being
invulnerable
,
because
experience
has
many
*NL*
times
proved
to
me
that
I
am
of
tender
flesh
and
not
at
all
impenetrable
;
*NL*
nor
that
of
being
proof
against
enchantment
,
for
I
have
already
seen
*NL*
myself
thrust
into
a
cage
,
in
which
all
the
world
would
not
have
been
*NL*
able
to
confine
me
except
by
force
of
enchantments
.
But
as
I
delivered
*NL*
myself
from
that
one
,
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
there
is
no
other
*NL*
that
can
hurt
me
;
and
so
,
these
enchanters
,
seeing
that
they
can
not
exert
*NL*
their
vile
craft
against
my
person
,
revenge
themselves
on
what
I
love
*NL*
most
,
and
seek
to
rob
me
of
life
by
maltreating
that
of
Dulcinea
in
whom
*NL*
I
live
;
and
therefore
I
am
convinced
that
when
my
squire
carried
my
*NL*
message
to
her
,
they
changed
her
into
a
common
peasant
girl
,
engaged
in
*NL*
such
a
mean
occupation
as
sifting
wheat
;
I
have
already
said
,
however
,
*NL*
that
that
wheat
was
not
red
wheat
,
nor
wheat
at
all
,
but
grains
of
orient
*NL*
pearl
.
And
as
a
proof
of
all
this
,
I
must
tell
your
highnesses
that
,
*NL*
coming
to
El
Toboso
a
short
time
back
,
I
was
altogether
unable
to
*NL*
discover
the
palace
of
Dulcinea
;
and
that
the
next
day
,
though
Sancho
,
my
*NL*
squire
,
saw
her
in
her
own
proper
shape
,
which
is
the
fairest
in
the
*NL*
world
,
to
me
she
appeared
to
be
a
coarse
,
ill-favoured
farm-wench
,
and
by
*NL*
no
means
a
well-spoken
one
,
she
who
is
propriety
itself
.
And
so
,
as
I
am
*NL*
not
and
,
so
far
as
one
can
judge
,
can
not
be
enchanted
,
she
it
is
that
is
*NL*
enchanted
,
that
is
smitten
,
that
is
altered
,
changed
,
and
transformed
;
in
*NL*
her
have
my
enemies
revenged
themselves
upon
me
,
and
for
her
shall
I
live
*NL*
in
ceaseless
tears
,
until
I
see
her
in
her
pristine
state
.
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
this
lest
anybody
should
mind
what
Sancho
said
about
Dulcinea
's
*NL*
winnowing
or
sifting
;
for
,
as
they
changed
her
to
me
,
it
is
no
wonder
if
*NL*
they
changed
her
to
him
.
Dulcinea
is
illustrious
and
well-born
,
and
of
*NL*
one
of
the
gentle
families
of
El
Toboso
,
which
are
many
,
ancient
,
and
*NL*
good
.
Therein
,
most
assuredly
,
not
small
is
the
share
of
the
peerless
*NL*
Dulcinea
,
through
whom
her
town
will
be
famous
and
celebrated
in
ages
to
*NL*
come
,
as
Troy
was
through
Helen
,
and
Spain
through
La
Cava
,
though
with
a
*NL*
better
title
and
tradition
.
For
another
thing
;
I
would
have
your
graces
*NL*
understand
that
Sancho
Panza
is
one
of
the
drollest
squires
that
ever
*NL*
served
knight-errant
;
sometimes
there
is
a
simplicity
about
him
so
acute
*NL*
that
it
is
an
amusement
to
try
and
make
out
whether
he
is
simple
or
*NL*
sharp
;
he
has
mischievous
tricks
that
stamp
him
rogue
,
and
blundering
*NL*
ways
that
prove
him
a
booby
;
he
doubts
everything
and
believes
*NL*
everything
;
when
I
fancy
he
is
on
the
point
of
coming
down
headlong
from
*NL*
sheer
stupidity
,
he
comes
out
with
something
shrewd
that
sends
him
up
to
*NL*
the
skies
.
After
all
,
I
would
not
exchange
him
for
another
squire
,
though
*NL*
I
were
given
a
city
to
boot
,
and
therefore
I
am
in
doubt
whether
it
will
*NL*
be
well
to
send
him
to
the
government
your
highness
has
bestowed
upon
*NL*
him
;
though
I
perceive
in
him
a
certain
aptitude
for
the
work
of
*NL*
governing
,
so
that
,
with
a
little
trimming
of
his
understanding
,
he
would
*NL*
manage
any
government
as
easily
as
the
king
does
his
taxes
;
and
moreover
,
*NL*
we
know
already
ample
experience
that
it
does
not
require
much
cleverness
*NL*
or
much
learning
to
be
a
governor
,
for
there
are
a
hundred
round
about
us
*NL*
that
scarcely
know
how
to
read
,
and
govern
like
gerfalcons
.
The
main
*NL*
point
is
that
they
should
have
good
intentions
and
be
desirous
of
doing
*NL*
right
in
all
things
,
for
they
will
never
be
at
a
loss
for
persons
to
*NL*
advise
and
direct
them
in
what
they
have
to
do
,
like
those
*NL*
knight-governors
who
,
being
no
lawyers
,
pronounce
sentences
with
the
aid
*NL*
of
an
assessor
.
My
advice
to
him
will
be
to
take
no
bribe
and
surrender
*NL*
no
right
,
and
I
have
some
other
little
matters
in
reserve
,
that
shall
be
*NL*
produced
in
due
season
for
Sancho
's
benefit
and
the
advantage
of
the
*NL*
island
he
is
to
govern
.

The
duke
,
duchess
,
and
Don
Quixote
had
reached
this
point
in
their
*NL*
conversation
,
when
they
heard
voices
and
a
great
hubbub
in
the
palace
,
*NL*
and
Sancho
burst
abruptly
into
the
room
all
glowing
with
anger
,
with
a
*NL*
straining-cloth
by
way
of
a
bib
,
and
followed
by
several
servants
,
or
,
*NL*
more
properly
speaking
,
kitchen-boys
and
other
underlings
,
one
of
whom
*NL*
carried
a
small
trough
full
of
water
,
that
from
its
colour
and
impurity
*NL*
was
plainly
dishwater
.
The
one
with
the
trough
pursued
him
and
followed
*NL*
him
everywhere
he
went
,
endeavouring
with
the
utmost
persistence
to
*NL*
thrust
it
under
his
chin
,
while
another
kitchen-boy
seemed
anxious
to
*NL*
wash
his
beard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
all
this
,
brothers
?
''
asked
the
duchess
.
``
What
is
it
?
What
do
you
*NL*
want
to
do
to
this
good
man
?
Do
you
forget
he
is
a
governor-elect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
barber
kitchen-boy
replied
,
``
The
gentleman
will
not
let
*NL*
himself
be
washed
as
is
customary
,
and
as
my
lord
and
the
senor
his
*NL*
master
have
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
,
''
said
Sancho
,
in
a
great
rage
;
``
but
I
'd
like
it
to
be
with
*NL*
cleaner
towels
,
clearer
lye
,
and
not
such
dirty
hands
;
for
there
's
not
so
*NL*
much
difference
between
me
and
my
master
that
he
should
be
washed
with
*NL*
angels

water
and
I
with
devil
's
lye
.
The
customs
of
countries
and
*NL*
princes
'
palaces
are
only
good
so
long
as
they
give
no
annoyance
;
but
the
*NL*
way
of
washing
they
have
here
is
worse
than
doing
penance
.
I
have
a
clean
*NL*
beard
,
and
I
do
n't
require
to
be
refreshed
in
that
fashion
,
and
whoever
*NL*
comes
to
wash
me
or
touch
a
hair
of
my
head
,
I
mean
to
say
my
beard
,
with
*NL*
all
due
respect
be
it
said
,
I
'll
give
him
a
punch
that
will
leave
my
fist
*NL*
sunk
in
his
skull
;
for
cirimonies
and
soapings
of
this
sort
are
more
like
*NL*
jokes

the
polite
attentions
of
one
's
host

The
duchess
was
ready
to
die
with
laughter
when
she
saw
Sancho
's
rage
and
*NL*
heard
his
words
;
but
it
was
no
pleasure
to
Don
Quixote
to
see
him
in
such
*NL*
a
sorry
trim
,
with
the
dingy
towel
about
him
,
and
the
hangers-on
of
the
*NL*
kitchen
all
round
him
;
so
making
a
low
bow
to
the
duke
and
duchess
,
as
if
*NL*
to
ask
their
permission
to
speak
,
he
addressed
the
rout
in
a
dignified
*NL*
tone
:
``
Holloa

gentlemen
!
you
let
that
youth
alone
,
and
go
back
to
where
*NL*
you
came
from

or
anywhere
else
if
you
like
;
my
squire
is
as
clean
as
any
*NL*
other
person
,
and
those
troughs
are
as
bad
as
narrow
thin-necked
jars
to
*NL*
him
;
take
my
advice
and
leave
him
alone
,
for
neither
he
nor
I
understand
*NL*
joking

*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
took
the
word
out
of
his
mouth
and
went
on
,
``
Nay

Upon
this

the

laughing
all

said

Besides
,
you
promoters
of
cleanliness
have
*NL*
been
excessively
careless
and
thoughtless
,
I
do
n't
know
if
I
ought
not
to
*NL*
say
audacious
,
to
bring
troughs
and
wooden
utensils
and
kitchen
*NL*
dishclouts
,
instead
of
basins
and
jugs
of
pure
gold
and
towels
of
*NL*
holland
,
to
such
a
person
and
such
a
beard
;
but
,
after
all
,
you
are
*NL*
ill-conditioned
and
ill-bred
,
and
spiteful
as
you
are
,
you
can
not
help
*NL*
showing
the
grudge
you
have
against
the
squires
of
knights-errant

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
impudent
servitors
,
and
even
the
seneschal
who
came
with
them
,
took
*NL*
the
duchess
to
be
speaking
in
earnest
,
so
they
removed
the
*NL*
straining-cloth
from
Sancho
's
neck
,
and
with
something
like
shame
and
*NL*
confusion
of
face
went
off
all
of
them
and
left
him
;
whereupon
he
,
seeing
*NL*
himself
safe
out
of
that
extreme
danger
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
ran
and
*NL*
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
duchess
,
saying
,
``
From
great
ladies
great
*NL*
favours
may
be
looked
for
;
this
which
your
grace
has
done
me
today
can
not
*NL*
be
requited
with
less
than
wishing
I
was
dubbed
a
knight-errant
,
to
*NL*
devote
myself
all
the
days
of
my
life
to
the
service
of
so
exalted
a
*NL*
lady
.
I
am
a
labouring
man
,
my
name
is
Sancho
Panza
,
I
am
married
,
I
have
*NL*
children
,
and
I
am
serving
as
a
squire
;
if
in
any
one
of
these
ways
I
can
*NL*
serve
your
highness
,
I
will
not
be
longer
in
obeying
than
your
grace
in
*NL*
commanding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
easy
to
see
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
the
duchess
,
``
that
you
have
learned
*NL*
to
be
polite
in
the
school
of
politeness
itself
;
I
mean
to
say
it
is
easy
*NL*
to
see
that
you
have
been
nursed
in
the
bosom
of
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
who
*NL*
is
,
of
course
,
the
cream
of
good
breeding
and
flower
of
ceremony
--
or
*NL*
cirimony
,
as
you
would
say
yourself
.
Fair
be
the
fortunes
of
such
a
*NL*
master
and
such
a
servant
,
the
one
the
cynosure
of
knight-errantry
,
the
*NL*
other
the
star
of
squirely
fidelity
!
Rise
,
Sancho
,
my
friend
;
I
will
*NL*
repay
your
courtesy
by
taking
care
that
my
lord
the
duke
makes
good
to
*NL*
you
the
promised
gift
of

government
as
soon
as
possible

*NL*
*NL*
With
this
,
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
,
and
Don
Quixote
retired
to
*NL*
take
his
midday
sleep
;
but
the
duchess
begged
Sancho
,
unless
he
had
a
*NL*
very
great
desire
to
go
to
sleep
,
to
come
and
spend
the
afternoon
with
*NL*
her
and
her
damsels
in
a
very
cool
chamber
.
Sancho
replied
that
,
though
*NL*
he
certainly
had
the
habit
of
sleeping
four
or
five
hours
in
the
heat
of
*NL*
the
day
in
summer
,
to
serve
her
excellence
he
would
try
with
all
his
*NL*
might
not
to
sleep
even
one
that
day
,
and
that
he
would
come
in
obedience
*NL*
to
her
command
,
and
with
that
he
went
off
.
The
duke
gave
fresh
orders
*NL*
with
respect
to
treating
Don
Quixote
as
a
knight-errant
,
without
*NL*
departing
even
in
smallest
particular
from
the
style
in
which
,
as
the
*NL*
stories
tell
us
,
they
used
to
treat
the
knights
of
old

CHAPTER
XXXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
DELECTABLE
DISCOURSE
WHICH
THE
DUCHESS
AND
HER
DAMSELS
HELD
WITH
*NL*
SANCHO
PANZA
,
WELL
WORTH
READING
AND
NOTING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
records
that
Sancho
did
not
sleep
that
afternoon
,
but
in
*NL*
order
to
keep
his
word
came
,
before
he
had
well
done
dinner
,
to
visit
the
*NL*
duchess
,
who
,
finding
enjoyment
in
listening
to
him
,
made
him
sit
down
*NL*
beside
her
on
a
low
seat
,
though
Sancho
,
out
of
pure
good
breeding
,
*NL*
wanted
not
to
sit
down
;
the
duchess
,
however
,
told
him
he
was
to
sit
down
*NL*
as
governor
and
talk
as
squire
,
as
in
both
respects
he
was
worthy
of
even
*NL*
the
chair
of
the
Cid
Ruy
Diaz
the
Campeador
.
Sancho
shrugged
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
obeyed
,
and
sat
down
,
and
all
the
duchess
's
damsels
and
*NL*
duennas
gathered
round
him
,
waiting
in
profound
silence
to
hear
what
he
*NL*
would
say
.
It
was
the
duchess
,
however
,
who
spoke
first
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
we
are
alone
,
and
that
there
is
nobody
here
to
overhear
us
,
I
*NL*
should
be
glad
if
the
senor
governor
would
relieve
me
of
certain
doubts
I
*NL*
have
,
rising
out
of
the
history
of
the
great
Don
Quixote
that
is
now
in
*NL*
print
.
One
is
:
inasmuch
as
worthy
Sancho
never
saw
Dulcinea
,
I
mean
the
*NL*
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
nor
took
Don
Quixote
's
letter
to
her
,
for
it
*NL*
was
left
in
the
memorandum
book
in
the
Sierra
Morena
,
how
did
he
dare
to
*NL*
invent
the
answer
and
all
that
about
finding
her
sifting
wheat
,
the
whole
*NL*
story
being
a
deception
and
falsehood
,
and
so
much
to
the
prejudice
of
*NL*
the
peerless
Dulcinea
's
good
name
,
a
thing
that
is
not
at
all
becoming
*NL*
the
character
and
fidelity
of
a
good
squire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
,
Sancho
,
without
uttering
one
in
reply
,
got
up
from
his
*NL*
chair
,
and
with
noiseless
steps
,
with
his
body
bent
and
his
finger
on
his
*NL*
lips
,
went
all
round
the
room
lifting
up
the
hangings
;
and
this
done
,
he
*NL*
came
back
to
his
seat
and
said
,
``
Now
,
senora
,
that
I
have
seen
that
there
*NL*
is
no
one
except
the
bystanders
listening
to
us
on
the
sly
,
I
will
answer
*NL*
what
you
have
asked
me
,
and
all
you
may
ask
me
,
without
fear
or
dread
.
*NL*
And
the
first
thing
I
have
got
to
say
is
,
that
for
my
own
part
I
hold
my
*NL*
master
Don
Quixote
to
be
stark
mad
,
though
sometimes
he
says
things
that
,
*NL*
to
my
mind
,
and
indeed
everybody
's
that
listens
to
him
,
are
so
wise
,
and
*NL*
run
in
such
a
straight
furrow
,
that
Satan
himself
could
not
have
said
*NL*
them
better
;
but
for
all
that
,
really
,
and
beyond
all
question
,
it
's
my
*NL*
firm
belief
he
is
cracked
.
Well
,
then
,
as
this
is
clear
to
my
mind
,
I
can
*NL*
venture
to
make
him
believe
things
that
have
neither
head
nor
tail
,
like
*NL*
that
affair
of
the
answer
to
the
letter
,
and
that
other
of
six
or
eight
*NL*
days
ago
,
which
is
not
yet
in
history
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
affair
of
the
*NL*
enchantment
of
my
lady
Dulcinea
;
for
I
made
him
believe
she
is
enchanted
,
*NL*
though
there
's
no
more
truth
in
it
than
over
the
hills
of
Ubeda
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
begged
him
to
tell
her
about
the
enchantment
or
deception
,
so
*NL*
Sancho
told
the
whole
story
exactly
as
it
had
happened
,
and
his
hearers
*NL*
were
not
a
little
amused
by
it
;
and
then
resuming
,
the
duchess
said
,
``
In
*NL*
consequence
of
what
worthy
Sancho
has
told
me
,
a
doubt
starts
up
in
my
*NL*
mind
,
and
there
comes
a
kind
of
whisper
to
my
ear
that
says
,
`
If
Don
*NL*
Quixote
be
mad
,
crazy
,
and
cracked
,
and
Sancho
Panza
his
squire
knows
it
,
*NL*
and
,
notwithstanding
,
serves
and
follows
him
,
and
goes
trusting
to
his
*NL*
empty
promises
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
he
must
be
still
madder
and
sillier
*NL*
than
his
master
;
and
that
being
so
,
it
will
be
cast
in
your
teeth
,
senora
*NL*
duchess
,
if
you
give
the
said
Sancho
an
island
to
govern
;
for
how
will
he
*NL*
who
does
not
know
how
to
govern
himself
know
how
to
govern
others
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
,
senora
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
that
doubt
comes
timely
;
but
your
*NL*
grace
may
say
it
out
,
and
speak
plainly
,
or
as
you
like
;
for
I
know
what
*NL*
you
say
is
true
,
and
if
I
were
wise
I
should
have
left
my
master
long
*NL*
ago
;
but
this
was
my
fate
,
this
was
my
bad
luck
;
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
I
must
*NL*
follow
him
;
we
're
from
the
same
village
,
I
've
eaten
his
bread
,
I
'm
fond
*NL*
of
him
,
I
'm
grateful
,
he
gave
me
his
ass-colts
,
and
above
all
I
'm
*NL*
faithful
;
so
it
's
quite
impossible
for
anything
to
separate
us
,
except
*NL*
the
pickaxe
and
shovel
.
And
if
your
highness
does
not
like
to
give
me
the
*NL*
government
you
promised
,
God
made
me
without
it
,
and
maybe
your
not
*NL*
giving
it
to
me
will
be
all
the
better
for
my
conscience
,
for
fool
as
I
*NL*
am
I
know
the
proverb
`
to
her
hurt
the
ant
got
wings
,
'
and
it
may
be
that
*NL*
Sancho
the
squire
will
get
to
heaven
sooner
than
Sancho
the
governor
.
*NL*
`
They
make
as
good
bread
here
as
in
France
,
'
and
`
by
night
all
cats
are
*NL*
grey

and

a
hard
case
enough
his

who
has
n't
broken
his
fast
at
two
in
*NL*
the
afternoon

`
there
's
no
stomach
a
hand

breadth
bigger
than
*NL*
another

and
the

can
be
filled
`
with
straw

as
the
saying

is
,
and
`
the
little
birds
of
the
field
have
God
for

purveyor
and
*NL*
caterer

'
and
`
four
yards
of
Cuenca
frieze
keep
one
warmer
than
four
of
*NL*
Segovia
broad-cloth
,
'
and
`
when
we
quit
this
world
and
are
put
*NL*
underground
the
prince
travels
by
as
narrow
a
path
as
the
journeyman
,

*NL*
and
`
the
Pope

body
does
not
take
up
more
feet
of
earth
than
the
*NL*
sacristan

for
all
that
the
one
is
higher
than
the
other

for
when
we
*NL*
go
to
our
graves
we
all
pack

up

make

small

rather
they
pack
us
up

make
us
small
in

of
us

then

good

night
to
us

I
say
once
more
,
if
your
ladyship
does
not
like
to
give
*NL*
me
the
island
because
I
'm
a
fool
,
like
a
wise
man
I
will
take
care
to
*NL*
give
myself
no
trouble
about
it

I
have
heard
say
that
`
behind

cross

from

riches

Roderick

taken
to

*NL*
``
To

do
n't

''
exclaimed
Dona
Rodriguez
,
the
duenna
,
who
*NL*
was
one
of
the
listeners
.
``
Why
,
there
's
a
ballad

says
they
put
King

Rodrigo
alive
into
a
tomb
full
of
toads
,
and
adders
,
and
lizards
,
and
*NL*
that
two
days
afterwards
the
king
,
in
a
plaintive
,
feeble
voice
,
cried
*NL*
out
from
within
the
tomb
--
*NL*
*NL*
They
gnaw
me
now
,
they
gnaw
me
now
,
*NL*
There
where
I
most
did
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
according
to
that
the
gentleman
has
good
reason
to
say
he
would
*NL*
rather
be
a
labouring
man
than
a
king
,
if
vermin
are
to
eat
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
simplicity
of
her
duenna
,
or
*NL*
wondering
at
the
language
and
proverbs
of
Sancho
,
to
whom
she
said
,
*NL*
``
Worthy
Sancho
knows
very
well
that
when
once
a
knight
has
made
a
promise
*NL*
he
strives
to
keep
it
,
though
it
should
cost
him
his
life
.
My
lord
and
*NL*
husband
the
duke
,
though
not
one
of
the
errant
sort
,
is
none
the
less
a
*NL*
knight
for
that
reason
,
and
will
keep
his
word
about
the
promised
island
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
envy
and
malice
of
the
world
.
Let
Sancho
be
of
good
*NL*
cheer
;
for
when
he
least
expects
it
he
will
find
himself
seated
on
the
*NL*
throne
of
his
island
and
seat
of
dignity
,
and
will
take
possession
of
his
*NL*
government
that
he
may
discard
it
for
another
of
three-bordered
brocade
.
*NL*
The
charge
I
give
him
is
to
be
careful
how
he
governs
his
vassals
,
*NL*
bearing
in
mind
that
they
are
all
loyal
and
well-born
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
governing
them
well
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
there
's
no
need
of
charging
me
*NL*
to
do
that
,
for
I
'm
kind-hearted
by
nature
,
and
full
of
compassion
for
*NL*
the
poor
;
there
's
no
stealing
the
loaf
from
him
who
kneads
and
bakes
;
'
*NL*
and
by
my
faith
it
wo
n't
do
to
throw
false
dice
with
me
;
I
am
an
old
dog
,
*NL*
and
I
know
all
about
`
tus

tus

I
can
be
wide-awake
if
need
be
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
let
clouds
come
before
my
eyes
,
for
I
know
where
the
shoe
pinches
*NL*
me
;
I
say
so
,
because
with
me
the
good
will
have
support
and
protection
,
*NL*
and
the
bad
neither
footing
nor
access
.
And
it
seems
to
me
that
,
in
*NL*
governments
,
to
make
a
beginning
is
everything
;
and
maybe
,
after
having
*NL*
been
governor
a
fortnight
,
I
'll
take
kindly
to
the
work

know
more

right
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
for
no
one
is
born
ready
*NL*
taught
,
and
the
bishops
are
made
out
of
men
and
not
out
of
stones
.
But
to
*NL*
return
to
the
subject
we
were
discussing
just
now
,
the
enchantment
of
the
*NL*
lady
Dulcinea
,
I
look
upon
it
as
certain
,
and
something
more
than
*NL*
evident
,
that
Sancho
's
idea
of
practising
a
deception
upon
his
master
,
*NL*
making
him
believe
that
the
peasant
girl
was
Dulcinea
and
that
if
he
did
*NL*
not
recognise
her
it
must
be
because
she
was
enchanted
,
was
all
a
device
*NL*
of
one
of
the
enchanters
that
persecute
Don
Quixote
.
For
in
truth
and
*NL*
earnest
,
I
know
from
good
authority
that
the
coarse
country
wench
who
*NL*
jumped
up
on
the
ass
was
and
is
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
and
that
worthy
*NL*
Sancho
,
though
he
fancies
himself
the
deceiver
,
is
the
one
that
is
*NL*
deceived
;
and
that
there
is
no
more
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
,
*NL*
than
of
anything
else
we
never
saw
.
Senor
Sancho
Panza
must
know
that
we
*NL*
too
have
enchanters
here
that
are
well
disposed
to
us
,
and
tell
us
what
*NL*
goes
on
in
the
world
,
plainly
and
distinctly
,
without
subterfuge
or
*NL*
deception
;
and
believe
me
,
Sancho
,
that
agile
country
lass
was
and
is
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
who
is
as
much
enchanted
as
the
mother
that
bore
*NL*
her
;
and
when
we
least
expect
it
,
we
shall
see
her
in
her
own
proper
*NL*
form
,
and
then
Sancho
will
be
disabused
of
the
error
he
is
under
at
*NL*
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
's
very
possible
,
''
said
Sancho
Panza
;
``
and
now
I
'm
willing
to
*NL*
believe
what
my
master
says
about
what
he
saw
in
the
cave
of
Montesinos
,
*NL*
where
he
says
he
saw
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
in
the
very
same
dress
*NL*
and
apparel
that
I
said
I
had
seen
her
in
when
I
enchanted
her
all
to
*NL*
please
myself
.
It
must
be
all
exactly
the
other
way
,
as
your
ladyship
*NL*
says
;
because
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
out
of
my
poor
wit
such
a
*NL*
cunning
trick
could
be
concocted
in
a
moment
,
nor
do
I
think
my
master
is
*NL*
so
mad
that
by
my
weak
and
feeble
persuasion
he
could
be
made
to
believe
*NL*
a
thing
so
out
of
all
reason
.
But
,
senora
,
your
excellence
must
not
*NL*
therefore
think
me
ill-disposed
,
for
a
dolt
like
me
is
not
bound
to
see
*NL*
into
the
thoughts
and
plots
of
those
vile
enchanters
.
I
invented
all
that
*NL*
to
escape
my
master
's
scolding
,
and
not
with
any
intention
of
hurting
*NL*
him
;
and
if
it
has
turned
out
differently
,
there
is
a
God
in
heaven
who
*NL*
judges
our
hearts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
duchess
;
``
but
tell
me
,
Sancho
,
what
is
this
you
*NL*
say
about
the
cave
of
Montesinos
,
for
I
should
like
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
upon
this
related
to
her
,
word
for
word
,
what
has
been
said
*NL*
already
touching
that
adventure
,
and
having
heard
it
the
duchess
said
,
*NL*
``
From
this
occurrence
it
may
be
inferred
that
,
as
the
great
Don
Quixote
*NL*
says
he
saw
there
the
same
country
wench
Sancho
saw
on
the
way
from
El
*NL*
Toboso
,
it
is
,
no
doubt
,
Dulcinea
,
and
that
there
are
some
very
active
*NL*
and
exceedingly
busy
enchanters
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
say
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
if
my
lady
Dulcinea
is
enchanted
,
so
much
*NL*
the
worse
for
her
,
and
I
'm
not
going
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
my
master
's
*NL*
enemies
,
who
seem
to
be
many
and
spiteful
.
The
truth
is
that
the
one
I
*NL*
saw
was
a
country
wench
,
and
I
set
her
down
to
be
a
country
wench
;
and
if
*NL*
that
was
Dulcinea
it
must
not
be
laid
at
my
door
,
nor
should
I
be
called
*NL*
to
answer
for
it
or
take
the
consequences
.
But
they
must
go
nagging
at
me
*NL*
at
every
step
--
`
Sancho
said
it
,
Sancho
did
it
,
Sancho
here
,
Sancho
*NL*
there
,
'
as
if
Sancho
was
nobody
at
all
,
and
not
that
same
Sancho
Panza
*NL*
that
's
now
going
all
over
the
world
in
books
,
so
Samson
Carrasco
told
me
,
*NL*
and
he
's
at
any
rate
one
that
's
a
bachelor
of
Salamanca
;
and
people
of
*NL*
that
sort
ca
n't
lie
,
except
when
the
whim
seizes
them
or
they
have
some
*NL*
very
good
reason
for
it
.
So
there
's
no
occasion
for
anybody
to
quarrel
*NL*
with
me
;
and
then
I
have
a
good
character
,
and
,
as
I
have
heard
my
master
*NL*
say
,
'
a
good
name
is
better
than
great
riches
;
'
let
them
only
stick
me
*NL*
into
this
government
and
they
'll
see
wonders
,
for
one
who
has
been
a
good
*NL*
squire
will
be
a
good
governor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
worthy
Sancho
's
observations
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
are
Catonian
*NL*
sentences
,
or
at
any
rate
out
of
the
very
heart
of
Michael
Verino
*NL*
himself
,
who
florentibus
occidit
annis
.
In
fact
,
to
speak
in
his
own
*NL*
style
,
`
under
a
bad
cloak
there
's
often
a
good
drinker
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
senora
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
never
yet
drank
out
of
wickedness
;
from
*NL*
thirst
I
have
very
likely
,
for
I
have
nothing
of
the
hypocrite
in
me
;
I
*NL*
drink
when
I
'm
inclined
,
or
,
if
I
'm
not
inclined
,
when
they
offer
it
to
*NL*
me
,
so
as
not
to
look
either
strait-laced
or
ill-bred
;
for
when
a
friend
*NL*
drinks
one
's
health
what
heart
can
be
so
hard
as
not
to
return
it
?
But
if
*NL*
I
put
on
my
shoes
I
do
n't
dirty
them
;
besides
,
squires
to
knights-errant
*NL*
mostly
drink
water
,
for
they
are
always
wandering
among
woods
,
forests
*NL*
and
meadows
,
mountains
and
crags
,
without
a
drop
of
wine
to
be
had
if
*NL*
they
gave
their
eyes
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
believe
,
''
said
the
duchess
;
``
and
now
let
Sancho
go
and
take
his
*NL*
sleep
,
and
we
will
talk
by-and-by
at
greater
length
,
and
settle
how
he
*NL*
may
soon
go
and
stick
himself
into
the
government
,
as
he
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
once
more
kissed
the
duchess
's
hand
,
and
entreated
her
to
let
good
*NL*
care
be
taken
of
his
Dapple
,
for
he
was
the
light
of
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
Dapple
?
''
said
the
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
ass
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
which
,
not
to
mention
him
by
that
name
,
I
'm
*NL*
accustomed
to
call
Dapple
;
I
begged
this
lady
duenna
here
to
take
care
of
*NL*
him
when
I
came
into
the
castle
,
and
she
got
as
angry
as
if
I
had
said
*NL*
she
was
ugly
or
old
,
though
it
ought
to
be
more
natural
and
proper
for
*NL*
duennas
to
feed
asses
than
to
ornament
chambers

God
bless
me
!
what
a
*NL*
spite
a
gentleman
of
my
village
had
against
these
ladies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
have
been
some
clown
,
''
said
Dona
Rodriguez
the
duenna
;
``
for
if
*NL*
he
had
been
a
gentleman

well-born

would
have
exalted
them
higher

horns

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do

said
the
duchess

no
more
of
this
;
hush

Dona
Rodriguez

*NL*
and
let
Senor
Panza
rest
easy
and
leave
the
treatment
of
Dapple
in
my
*NL*
charge
,
for
as
he
is
a
treasure
of
Sancho
's
,
I
'll
put
him
on
the
apple
of
*NL*
my
eye

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
enough
for
him
to
be
in
the
stable
,

said
Sancho
,
``
for
*NL*
neither
he
nor
I
are
worthy
to
rest
a
moment
in
the
apple
of
your
*NL*
highness

eye
,
and
I
'd
as
soon
stab
myself
as
consent
to
it
;
for
though
*NL*
my
master
says
that
in
civilities
it
is
better
to
lose
by
a
card
too
many
*NL*
than
a
card
too
few
,
when
it
comes
to
civilities
to
asses

must
mind

what
we
are
about

keep
within
due
bounds

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
him
to
your
government
,
Sancho

''
said
the
duchess
,
``
and
there
you
*NL*
will
be
able
to
make
as
much
of
him
as
you
like

even
release
him

from
work

him
off

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

*NL*
Sancho

I
have
seen
more
than
two
asses
go
to
governments

take
mine
with

be
nothing
new

*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
's
words
made
the
duchess
laugh
again
and
gave
her
fresh
amusement
,
*NL*
and
dismissing
him
to
sleep
she
went
away
to
tell
the

the
*NL*
conversation
she
had
had
with
him
,

between
them
they
plotted
and

arranged
to
play
a
joke
upon
Don

that
was
to
be
a

one

*NL*
entirely
in

in
that

they
practised
*NL*
several
upon
him

so
much
in

so
clever

CHAPTER
XXXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
RELATES
HOW
THEY
LEARNED
THE
WAY
IN
WHICH
THEY
WERE
TO
DISENCHANT
*NL*
THE
PEERLESS
DULCINEA
DEL
TOBOSO
,
WHICH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
RAREST
ADVENTURES
*NL*
IN
THIS
BOOK
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Great
was
the
pleasure
the
duke
and
duchess
took
in
the
conversation
of
*NL*
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
Panza
;
and
,
more
bent
than
ever
upon
the
plan
they
*NL*
had
of
practising
some
jokes
upon
them
that
should
have
the
look
and
*NL*
appearance
of
adventures
,
they
took
as
their
basis
of
action
what
Don
*NL*
Quixote
had
already
told
them
about
the
cave
of
Montesinos
,
in
order
to
*NL*
play
him
a
famous
one
.
But
what
the
duchess
marvelled
at
above
all
was
*NL*
that
Sancho
's
simplicity
could
be
so
great
as
to
make
him
believe
as
*NL*
absolute
truth
that
Dulcinea
had
been
enchanted
,
when
it
was
he
himself
*NL*
who
had
been
the
enchanter
and
trickster
in
the
business
.
Having
,
*NL*
therefore
,
instructed
their
servants
in
everything
they
were
to
do
,
six
*NL*
days
afterwards
they
took
him
out
to
hunt
,
with
as
great
a
retinue
of
*NL*
huntsmen
and
beaters
as
a
crowned
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
presented
Don
Quixote
with
a
hunting
suit
,
and
Sancho
with
another
*NL*
of
the
finest
green
cloth
;
but
Don
Quixote
declined
to
put
his
on
,
saying
*NL*
that
he
must
soon
return
to
the
hard
pursuit
of
arms
,
and
could
not
carry
*NL*
wardrobes
or
stores
with
him
.
Sancho
,
however
,
took
what
they
gave
him
,
*NL*
meaning
to
sell
it
at
the
first
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appointed
day
having
arrived
,
Don
Quixote
armed
himself
,
and
Sancho
*NL*
arrayed
himself
,
and
mounted
on
his
Dapple
-LRB-
for
he
would
not
give
him
up
*NL*
though
they
offered
him
a
horse
-RRB-
,
he
placed
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
troop
of
huntsmen
.
The
duchess
came
out
splendidly
attired
,
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
in
pure
courtesy
and
politeness
,
held
the
rein
of
her
palfrey
,
*NL*
though
the
duke
wanted
not
to
allow
him
;
and
at
last
they
reached
a
wood
*NL*
that
lay
between
two
high
mountains
,
where
,
after
occupying
various
*NL*
posts
,
ambushes
,
and
paths
,
and
distributing
the
party
in
different
*NL*
positions
,
the
hunt
began
with
great
noise
,
shouting
,
and
hallooing
,
so
*NL*
that
,
between
the
baying
of
the
hounds
and
the
blowing
of
the
horns
,
they
*NL*
could
not
hear
one
another
.
The
duchess
dismounted
,
and
with
a
sharp
*NL*
boar-spear
in
her
hand
posted
herself
where
she
knew
the
wild
boars
were
*NL*
in
the
habit
of
passing
.
The
duke
and
Don
Quixote
likewise
dismounted
and
*NL*
placed
themselves
one
at
each
side
of
her
.
Sancho
took
up
a
position
in
*NL*
the
rear
of
all
without
dismounting
from
Dapple
,
whom
he
dared
not
desert
*NL*
lest
some
mischief
should
befall
him
.
Scarcely
had
they
taken
their
stand
*NL*
in
a
line
with
several
of
their
servants
,
when
they
saw
a
huge
boar
,
*NL*
closely
pressed
by
the
hounds
and
followed
by
the
huntsmen
,
making
*NL*
towards
them
,
grinding
his
teeth
and
tusks
,
and
scattering
foam
from
his
*NL*
mouth
.
As
soon
as
he
saw
him
Don
Quixote
,
bracing
his
shield
on
his
arm
,
*NL*
and
drawing
his
sword
,
advanced
to
meet
him
;
the
duke
with
boar-spear
did
*NL*
the
same
;
but
the
duchess
would
have
gone
in
front
of
them
all
had
not
*NL*
the
duke
prevented
her
.
Sancho
alone
,
deserting
Dapple
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
the
mighty
beast
,
took
to
his
heels
as
hard
as
he
could
and
strove
in
*NL*
vain
to
mount
a
tall
oak
.
As
he
was
clinging
to
a
branch
,
however
,
*NL*
half-way
up
in
his
struggle
to
reach
the
top
,
the
bough
,
such
was
his
*NL*
ill-luck
and
hard
fate
,
gave
way
,
and
caught
in
his
fall
by
a
broken
limb
*NL*
of
the
oak
,
he
hung
suspended
in
the
air
unable
to
reach
the
ground
.
*NL*
Finding
himself
in
this
position
,
and
that
the
green
coat
was
beginning
*NL*
to
tear
,
and
reflecting
that
if
the
fierce
animal
came
that
way
he
might
*NL*
be
able
to
get
at
him
,
he
began
to
utter
such
cries
,
and
call
for
help
so
*NL*
earnestly
,
that
all
who
heard
him
and
did
not
see
him
felt
sure
he
must
*NL*
be
in
the
teeth
of
some
wild
beast
.
In
the
end
the
tusked
boar
fell
*NL*
pierced
by
the
blades
of
the
many
spears
they
held
in
front
of
him
;
and
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
turning
round
at
the
cries
of
Sancho
,
for
he
knew
by
them
*NL*
that
it
was
he
,
saw
him
hanging
from
the
oak
head
downwards
,
with
Dapple
,
*NL*
who
did
not
forsake
him
in
his
distress
,
close
beside
him
;
and
Cide
*NL*
Hamete
observes
that
he
seldom
saw
Sancho
Panza
without
seeing
Dapple
,
or
*NL*
Dapple
without
seeing
Sancho
Panza
;
such
was
their
attachment
and
loyalty
*NL*
one
to
the
other
.
Don
Quixote
went
over
and
unhooked
Sancho
,
who
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
found
himself
on
the
ground
,
looked
at
the
rent
in
his
huntingcoat
*NL*
and
was
grieved
to
the
heart
,
for
he
thought
he
had
got
a
patrimonial
*NL*
estate
in
that
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
they
had
slung
the
mighty
boar
across
the
back
of
a
mule
,
and
*NL*
having
covered
it
with
sprigs
of
rosemary
and
branches
of
myrtle
,
they
*NL*
bore
it
away
as
the
spoils
of
victory
to
some
large
field-tents
which
had
*NL*
been
pitched
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
,
where
they
found
the
tables
laid
*NL*
and
dinner
served
,
in
such
grand
and
sumptuous
style
that
it
was
easy
to
*NL*
see
the
rank
and
magnificence
of
those
who
had
provided
it
.
Sancho
,
as
he
*NL*
showed
the
rents
in
his
torn
suit
to
the
duchess
,
observed
,
``
If
we
had
*NL*
been
hunting
hares
,
or
after
small
birds
,
my
coat
would
have
been
safe
*NL*
from
being
in
the
plight
it
's
in
;
I
do
n't
know
what
pleasure
one
can
find
*NL*
in
lying
in
wait
for
an
animal
that
may
take
your
life
with
his
tusk
if
*NL*
he
gets
at
you
.
I
recollect
having
heard
an
old
ballad
sung
that
says
,
*NL*
*NL*
By
bears
be
thou
devoured
,
as
erst
*NL*
Was
famous
Favila
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
was
a
Gothic
king
,
who
,
going
a-hunting
,
was
*NL*
devoured
by
a
bear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
I
would
not
have
kings
and
princes
expose
*NL*
themselves
to
such
dangers
for
the
sake
of
a
pleasure
which
,
to
my
mind
,
*NL*
ought
not
to
be
one
,
as
it
consists
in
killing
an
animal
that
has
done
no
*NL*
harm
whatever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
the
contrary
,
Sancho
;
you
are
wrong
there
,
''
said
the
duke
;
``
for
*NL*
hunting
is
more
suitable
and
requisite
for
kings
and
princes
than
for
*NL*
anybody
else
.
The
chase
is
the
emblem
of
war
;
it
has
stratagems
,
wiles
,
*NL*
and
crafty
devices
for
overcoming
the
enemy
in
safety
;
in
it
extreme
cold
*NL*
and
intolerable
heat
have
to
be
borne
,
indolence
and
sleep
are
despised
,
*NL*
the
bodily
powers
are
invigorated
,
the
limbs
of
him
who
engages
in
it
are
*NL*
made
supple
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
it
is
a
pursuit
which
may
be
followed
*NL*
without
injury
to
anyone
and
with
enjoyment
to
many
;
and
the
best
of
it
*NL*
is
,
it
is
not
for
everybody
,
as
field-sports
of
other
sorts
are
,
except
*NL*
hawking
,
which
also
is
only
for
kings
and
great
lords
.
Reconsider
your
*NL*
opinion
therefore
,
Sancho
,
and
when
you
are
governor
take
to
hunting
,
and
*NL*
you
will
find
the
good
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
the
good
governor
should
have
a
broken
leg
and
keep
*NL*
at
home
;
''
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
if
,
after
people
had
been
at
the
*NL*
trouble
of
coming
to
look
for
him
on
business
,
the
governor
were
to
be
*NL*
away
in
the
forest
enjoying
himself
;
the
government
would
go
on
badly
in
*NL*
that
fashion
.
By
my
faith
,
senor
,
hunting
and
amusements
are
more
fit
for
*NL*
idlers
than
for
governors
;
what
I
intend
to
amuse
myself
with
is
playing
*NL*
all
fours
at
Eastertime
,
and
bowls
on
Sundays
and
holidays
;
for
these
*NL*
huntings
do
n't
suit
my
condition
or
agree
with
my
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
it
may
turn
out
so
,
''
said
the
duke
;
``
because
it
's
a
long
step
*NL*
from
saying
to
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
that
as
it
may
,
''
said
Sancho
,
''
`
pledges
do
n't
distress
a
good
payer
,
'
*NL*
and
`
he
whom
God
helps
does
better
than
he
who
gets
up
early
,
'
and
`
it
's
*NL*
the
tripes
that
carry
the
feet
and
not
the
feet
the
tripes
;

I
mean
to
*NL*
say
that
if
God
gives
me
help
and
I
do
my
duty
honestly
,
no
doubt
I
'll
*NL*
govern
better
than
a
gerfalcon
.
Nay
,
let
them
only
put
a
finger
in
my
*NL*
mouth
,
and
they
'll
see
whether
I
can
bite
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
curse
of
God
and
all
his
saints
upon
thee
,
thou
accursed
Sancho
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
Don
Quixote
;
``
when
will
the
day
come
--
as
I
have
often
said
to
*NL*
thee
--
when
I
shall
hear
thee
make
one
single
coherent
,
rational
remark
*NL*
without
proverbs
?
Pray
,
your
highnesses
,
leave
this
fool
alone
,
for
he
*NL*
will
grind
your
souls
between
,
not
to
say
two
,
but
two
thousand
proverbs
,
*NL*
dragged
in
as
much
in
season
,
and
as
much
to
the
purpose
as
--
may
God
*NL*
grant
as
much
health
to
him
,
or
to
me
if
I
want
to
listen
to
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sancho
Panza
's
proverbs
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
though
more
in
number
than
*NL*
the
Greek
Commander
's
,
are
not
therefore
less
to
be
esteemed
for
the
*NL*
conciseness
of
the
maxims
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
can
say
they
give
me
more
*NL*
pleasure
than
others
that
may
be
better
brought
in
and
more
seasonably
*NL*
introduced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
pleasant
conversation
of
this
sort
they
passed
out
of
the
tent
into
*NL*
the
wood
,
and
the
day
was
spent
in
visiting
some
of
the
posts
and
*NL*
hiding-places
,
and
then
night
closed
in
,
not
,
however
,
as
brilliantly
or
*NL*
tranquilly
as
might
have
been
expected
at
the
season
,
for
it
was
then
*NL*
midsummer
;
but
bringing
with
it
a
kind
of
haze
that
greatly
aided
the
*NL*
project
of
the
duke
and
duchess
;
and
thus
,
as
night
began
to
fall
,
and
a
*NL*
little
after
twilight
set
in
,
suddenly
the
whole
wood
on
all
four
sides
*NL*
seemed
to
be
on
fire
,
and
shortly
after
,
here
,
there
,
on
all
sides
,
a
*NL*
vast
number
of
trumpets
and
other
military
instruments
were
heard
,
as
if
*NL*
several
troops
of
cavalry
were
passing
through
the
wood
.
The
blaze
of
the
*NL*
fire
and
the
noise
of
the
warlike
instruments
almost
blinded
the
eyes
and
*NL*
deafened
the
ears
of
those
that
stood
by
,
and
indeed
of
all
who
were
in
*NL*
the
wood
.
Then
there
were
heard
repeated
lelilies
after
the
fashion
of
*NL*
the
Moors
when
they
rush
to
battle
;
trumpets
and
clarions
brayed
,
drums
*NL*
beat
,
fifes
played
,
so
unceasingly
and
so
fast
that
he
could
not
have
had
*NL*
any
senses
who
did
not
lose
them
with
the
confused
din
of
so
many
*NL*
instruments
.
The
duke
was
astounded
,
the
duchess
amazed
,
Don
Quixote
*NL*
wondering
,
Sancho
Panza
trembling
,
and
indeed
,
even
they
who
were
aware
*NL*
of
the
cause
were
frightened
.
In
their
fear
,
silence
fell
upon
them
,
and
*NL*
a
postillion
,
in
the
guise
of
a
demon
,
passed
in
front
of
them
,
blowing
,
*NL*
in
lieu
of
a
bugle
,
a
huge
hollow
horn
that
gave
out
a
horrible
hoarse
*NL*
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
there
!
brother
courier
,
''
cried
the
duke
,
``
who
are
you
?
Where
are
you
*NL*
going
?
What
troops
are
these
that
seem
to
be
passing
through
the
wood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
courier
replied
in
a
harsh
,
discordant
voice
,
``
I
am
the
*NL*
devil
;
I
am
in
search
of
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
;
those
who
are
coming
*NL*
this
way
are
six
troops
of
enchanters
,
who
are
bringing
on
a
triumphal
*NL*
car
the
peerless
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
;
she
comes
under
enchantment
,
*NL*
together
with
the
gallant
Frenchman
Montesinos
,
to
give
instructions
to
*NL*
Don
Quixote
as
to
how
,
she
the
said
lady
,
may
be
disenchanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
the
devil
,
as
you
say
and
as
your
appearance
indicates
,
''
*NL*
said
the
duke
,
``
you
would
have
known
the
said
knight
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
for
you
have
him
here
before
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
and
upon
my
conscience
,
''
said
the
devil
,
``
I
never
observed
it
,
*NL*
for
my
mind
is
occupied
with
so
many
different
things
that
I
was
*NL*
forgetting
the
main
thing
I
came
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
demon
must
be
an
honest
fellow
and
a
good
Christian
,
''
said
Sancho
;
*NL*
``
for
if
he
was
n't
he
would
n't
swear
by
God
and
his
conscience
;
I
feel
*NL*
sure
now
there
must
be
good
souls
even
in
hell
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
dismounting
,
the
demon
then
turned
to
Don
Quixote
and
said
,
``
The
*NL*
unfortunate
but
valiant
knight
Montesinos
sends
me
to
thee
,
the
Knight
of
*NL*
the
Lions
-LRB-
would
that
I
saw
thee
in
their
claws
-RRB-
,
bidding
me
tell
thee
to
*NL*
wait
for
him
wherever
I
may
find
thee
,
as
he
brings
with
him
her
whom
*NL*
they
call
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
that
he
may
show
thee
what
is
needful
in
*NL*
order
to
disenchant
her
;
and
as
I
came
for
no
more
I
need
stay
no
longer
;
*NL*
demons
of
my
sort
be
with
thee
,
and
good
angels
with
these
gentles
;
''
and
*NL*
so
saying
he
blew
his
huge
horn
,
turned
about
and
went
off
without
*NL*
waiting
for
a
reply
from
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
felt
fresh
wonder
,
but
particularly
Sancho
and
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
Sancho
to
see
how
,
in
defiance
of
the
truth
,
they
would
have
it
that
*NL*
Dulcinea
was
enchanted
;
Don
Quixote
because
he
could
not
feel
sure
*NL*
whether
what
had
happened
to
him
in
the
cave
of
Montesinos
was
true
or
*NL*
not
;
and
as
he
was
deep
in
these
cogitations
the
duke
said
to
him
,
``
Do
*NL*
you
mean
to
wait
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
replied
he
;
``
here
will
I
wait
,
fearless
and
firm
,
though
all
*NL*
hell
should
come
to
attack
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
if
I
see
another
devil
or
hear
another
horn
like
the
last
,
*NL*
I
'll
wait
here
as
much
as
in
Flanders
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
now
closed
in
more
completely
,
and
many
lights
began
to
flit
*NL*
through
the
wood
,
just
as
those
fiery
exhalations
from
the
earth
,
that
*NL*
look
like
shooting-stars
to
our
eyes
,
flit
through
the
heavens
;
a
*NL*
frightful
noise
,
too
,
was
heard
,
like
that
made
by
the
solid
wheels
the
*NL*
ox-carts
usually
have
,
by
the
harsh
,
ceaseless
creaking
of
which
,
they
*NL*
say
,
the
bears
and
wolves
are
put
to
flight
,
if
there
happen
to
be
any
*NL*
where
they
are
passing
.
In
addition
to
all
this
commotion
,
there
came
a
*NL*
further
disturbance
to
increase
the
tumult
,
for
now
it
seemed
as
if
in
*NL*
truth
,
on
all
four
sides
of
the
wood
,
four
encounters
or
battles
were
*NL*
going
on
at
the
same
time
;
in
one
quarter
resounded
the
dull
noise
of
a
*NL*
terrible
cannonade
,
in
another
numberless
muskets
were
being
discharged
,
*NL*
the
shouts
of
the
combatants
sounded
almost
close
at
hand
,
and
farther
*NL*
away
the
Moorish
lelilies
were
raised
again
and
again
.
In
a
word
,
the
*NL*
bugles
,
the
horns
,
the
clarions
,
the
trumpets
,
the
drums
,
the
cannon
,
the
*NL*
musketry
,
and
above
all
the
tremendous
noise
of
the
carts
,
all
made
up
*NL*
together
a
din
so
confused
and
terrific
that
Don
Quixote
had
need
to
*NL*
summon
up
all
his
courage
to
brave
it
;
but
Sancho
's
gave
way
,
and
he
fell
*NL*
fainting
on
the
skirt
of
the
duchess
's
robe
,
who
let
him
lie
there
and
*NL*
promptly
bade
them
throw
water
in
his
face
.
This
was
done
,
and
he
came
to
*NL*
himself
by
the
time
that
one
of
the
carts
with
the
creaking
wheels
*NL*
reached
the
spot
.
It
was
drawn
by
four
plodding
oxen
all
covered
with
*NL*
black
housings
;
on
each
horn
they
had
fixed
a
large
lighted
wax
taper
,
*NL*
and
on
the
top
of
the
cart
was
constructed
a
raised
seat
,
on
which
sat
a
*NL*
venerable
old
man
with
a
beard
whiter
than
the
very
snow
,
and
so
long
*NL*
that
it
fell
below
his
waist
;
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
robe
of
black
*NL*
buckram
;
for
as
the
cart
was
thickly
set
with
a
multitude
of
candles
it
*NL*
was
easy
to
make
out
everything
that
was
on
it
.
Leading
it
were
two
*NL*
hideous
demons
,
also
clad
in
buckram
,
with
countenances
so
frightful
that
*NL*
Sancho
,
having
once
seen
them
,
shut
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
them
again
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
cart
came
opposite
the
spot
the
old
man
rose
from
his
*NL*
lofty
seat
,
and
standing
up
said
in
a
loud
voice
,
``
I
am
the
sage
*NL*
Lirgandeo
,
''
and
without
another
word
the
cart
then
passed
on
.
Behind
it
*NL*
came
another
of
the
same
form
,
with
another
aged
man
enthroned
,
who
,
*NL*
stopping
the
cart
,
said
in
a
voice
no
less
solemn
than
that
of
the
first
,
*NL*
``
I
am
the
sage
Alquife
,
the
great
friend
of
Urganda
the
Unknown
,
''
and
*NL*
passed
on
.
Then
another
cart
came
by
at
the
same
pace
,
but
the
occupant
*NL*
of
the
throne
was
not
old
like
the
others
,
but
a
man
stalwart
and
robust
,
*NL*
and
of
a
forbidding
countenance
,
who
as
he
came
up
said
in
a
voice
far
*NL*
hoarser
and
more
devilish
,
``
I
am
the
enchanter
Archelaus
,
the
mortal
*NL*
enemy
of
Amadis
of
Gaul
and
all
his
kindred
,
''
and
then
passed
on
.
Having
*NL*
gone
a
short
distance
the
three
carts
halted
and
the
monotonous
noise
of
*NL*
their
wheels
ceased
,
and
soon
after
they
heard
another
,
not
noise
,
but
*NL*
sound
of
sweet
,
harmonious
music
,
of
which
Sancho
was
very
glad
,
taking
*NL*
it
to
be
a
good
sign
;
and
said
he
to
the
duchess
,
from
whom
he
did
not
*NL*
stir
a
step
,
or
for
a
single
instant
,
``
Senora
,
where
there
's
music
there
*NL*
ca
n't
be
mischief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
where
there
are
lights
and
it
is
bright
,
''
said
the
duchess
;
to
which
*NL*
Sancho
replied
,
``
Fire
gives
light
,
and
it
's
bright
where
there
are
*NL*
bonfires
,
as
we
see
by
those
that
are
all
round
us
and
perhaps
may
burn
*NL*
us
;
but
music
is
a
sign
of
mirth
and
merrymaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
remains
to
be
seen
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
who
was
listening
to
all
*NL*
that
passed
;
and
he
was
right
,
as
is
shown
in
the
following
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXV
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
CONTINUED
THE
INSTRUCTION
GIVEN
TO
DON
QUIXOTE
TOUCHING
THE
*NL*
DISENCHANTMENT
OF
DULCINEA
,
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
MARVELLOUS
INCIDENTS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
advancing
towards
them
,
to
the
sound
of
this
pleasing
music
,
*NL*
what
they
call
a
triumphal
car
,
drawn
by
six
grey
mules
with
white
linen
*NL*
housings
,
on
each
of
which
was
mounted
a
penitent
,
robed
also
in
white
,
*NL*
with
a
large
lighted
wax
taper
in
his
hand
.
The
car
was
twice
or
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
three
times
as
large
as
the
former
ones
,
and
in
front
and
on
the
*NL*
sides
stood
twelve
more
penitents
,
all
as
white
as
snow
and
all
with
*NL*
lighted
tapers
,
a
spectacle
to
excite
fear
as
well
as
wonder
;
and
on
a
*NL*
raised
throne
was
seated
a
nymph
draped
in
a
multitude
of
silver-tissue
*NL*
veils
with
an
embroidery
of
countless
gold
spangles
glittering
all
over
*NL*
them
,
that
made
her
appear
,
if
not
richly
,
at
least
brilliantly
,
*NL*
apparelled
.
She
had
her
face
covered
with
thin
transparent
sendal
,
the
*NL*
texture
of
which
did
not
prevent
the
fair
features
of
a
maiden
from
being
*NL*
distinguished
,
while
the
numerous
lights
made
it
possible
to
judge
of
her
*NL*
beauty
and
of
her
years
,
which
seemed
to
be
not
less
than
seventeen
but
*NL*
not
to
have
yet
reached
twenty
.
Beside
her
was
a
figure
in
a
robe
of
*NL*
state
,
as
they
call
it
,
reaching
to
the
feet
,
while
the
head
was
covered
*NL*
with
a
black
veil
.
But
the
instant
the
car
was
opposite
the
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
and
Don
Quixote
the
music
of
the
clarions
ceased
,
and
then
that
*NL*
of
the
lutes
and
harps
on
the
car
,
and
the
figure
in
the
robe
rose
up
,
*NL*
and
flinging
it
apart
and
removing
the
veil
from
its
face
,
disclosed
to
*NL*
their
eyes
the
shape
of
Death
itself
,
fleshless
and
hideous
,
at
which
*NL*
sight
Don
Quixote
felt
uneasy
,
Sancho
frightened
,
and
the
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
displayed
a
certain
trepidation
.
Having
risen
to
its
feet
,
this
*NL*
living
death
,
in
a
sleepy
voice
and
with
a
tongue
hardly
awake
,
held
*NL*
forth
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
that
Merlin
who
the
legends
say
*NL*
The
devil
had
for
father
,
and
the
lie
*NL*
Hath
gathered
credence
with
the
lapse
of
time
.
*NL*
Of
magic
prince
,
of
Zoroastric
lore
*NL*
Monarch
and
treasurer
,
with
jealous
eye
*NL*
I
view
the
efforts
of
the
age
to
hide
*NL*
The
gallant
deeds
of
doughty
errant
knights
,
*NL*
Who
are
,
and
ever
have
been
,
dear
to
me
.
*NL*
Enchanters
and
magicians
and
their
kind
*NL*
*NL*
Are
mostly
hard
of
heart
;
not
so
am
I
;
*NL*
For
mine
is
tender
,
soft
,
compassionate
,
*NL*
And
its
delight
is
doing
good
to
all
.
*NL*
In
the
dim
caverns
of
the
gloomy
Dis
,
*NL*
Where
,
tracing
mystic
lines
and
characters
,
*NL*
My
soul
abideth
now
,
there
came
to
me
*NL*
The
sorrow-laden
plaint
of
her
,
the
fair
,
*NL*
The
peerless
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
.
*NL*
I
knew
of
her
enchantment
and
her
fate
,
*NL*
From
high-born
dame
to
peasant
wench
transformed
*NL*
And
touched
with
pity
,
first
I
turned
the
leaves
*NL*
Of
countless
volumes
of
my
devilish
craft
,
*NL*
And
then
,
in
this
grim
grisly
skeleton
*NL*
Myself
encasing
,
hither
have
I
come
*NL*
To
show
where
lies
the
fitting
remedy
*NL*
To
give
relief
in
such
a
piteous
case
.
*NL*
O
thou
,
the
pride
and
pink
of
all
that
I
wear
*NL*
*NL*
The
adamantine
steel
!
O
shining
light
,
*NL*
O
beacon
,
polestar
,
path
and
guide
of
all
*NL*
Who
,
scorning
slumber
and
the
lazy
down
,
*NL*
Adopt
the
toilsome
life
of
bloodstained
arms
!
*NL*
To
thee
,
great
hero
who
all
praise
transcends
,
*NL*
La
Mancha
's
lustre
and
Iberia
's
star
,
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
wise
as
brave
,
to
thee
I
say
--
*NL*
For
peerless
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
*NL*
Her
pristine
form
and
beauty
to
regain
,
*NL*
'
T
is
needful
that
thy
esquire
Sancho
shall
,
*NL*
On
his
own
sturdy
buttocks
bared
to
heaven
,
*NL*
Three
thousand
and
three
hundred
lashes
lay
,
*NL*
And
that
they
smart
and
sting
and
hurt
him
well
.
*NL*
Thus
have
the
authors
of
her
woe
resolved
.
*NL*
And
this
is
,
gentles
,
wherefore
I
have
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
that
's
good
,
''
exclaimed
Sancho
at
this
,
``
I
'll
just
as
soon
give
*NL*
myself
three
stabs
with
a
dagger
as
three
,
not
to
say
three
thousand
,
*NL*
lashes
.
The
devil
take
such
a
way
of
disenchanting
!
I
do
n't
see
what
my
*NL*
backside
has
got
to
do
with
enchantments
.
By
God
,
if
Senor
Merlin
has
not
*NL*
found
out
some
other
way
of
disenchanting
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
*NL*
she
may
go
to
her
grave
enchanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
take
you
,
Don
Clown
stuffed
with
garlic
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
``
and
tie
you
to
a
tree
as
naked
as
when
your
mother
brought
you
forth
,
*NL*
and
give
you
,
not
to
say
three
thousand
three
hundred
,
but
six
thousand
*NL*
six
hundred
lashes
,
and
so
well
laid
on
that
they
wo
n't
be
got
rid
of
if
*NL*
you
try
three
thousand
three
hundred
times
;
do
n't
answer
me
a
word
or
*NL*
I
'll
tear
your
soul
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
Merlin
said
,
``
That
will
not
do
,
for
the
lashes
worthy
*NL*
Sancho
has
to
receive
must
be
given
of
his
own
free
will
and
not
by
*NL*
force
,
and
at
whatever
time
he
pleases
,
for
there
is
no
fixed
limit
*NL*
assigned
to
him
;
but
it
is
permitted
him
,
if
he
likes
to
commute
by
half
*NL*
the
pain
of
this
whipping
,
to
let
them
be
given
by
the
hand
of
another
,
*NL*
though
it
may
be
somewhat
weighty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
hand
,
my
own
or
anybody
else
's
,
weighty
or
weighable
,
shall
touch
*NL*
me

''
said
Sancho
.
``
Was
it
I
that
gave
birth
to
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
*NL*
Toboso
,
that
my
backside
is
to
pay
for
the
sins
of
her
eyes

My
master

*NL*
indeed
,
that
's
a
part

her
--
for
,
he
's
always
calling
her
`
my
life

and
*NL*
`
my
soul
,

and
his
stay
and
prop
--
may
and
ought
to
whip
himself
for
her
*NL*
and
take
all
the
trouble
required
for
her
disenchantment
.
But
for
me
to
*NL*
whip
myself
!
Abernuncio
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Sancho
had
done
speaking
the
nymph
in
silver
that
was
at
the
*NL*
side
of
Merlin
's
ghost
stood
up
,
and
removing
the
thin
veil
from
her
face
*NL*
disclosed
one
that
seemed
to
all
something
more
than
exceedingly
*NL*
beautiful
;
and
with
a
masculine
freedom
from
embarrassment
and
in
a
voice
*NL*
not
very
like
a
lady
's
,
addressing
Sancho
directly
,
said
,
``
Thou
wretched
*NL*
squire
,
soul
of
a
pitcher
,
heart
of
a
cork
tree
,
with
bowels
of
flint
and
*NL*
pebbles
;
if
,
thou
impudent
thief
,
they
bade
thee
throw
thyself
down
from
*NL*
some
lofty
tower
;
if
,
enemy
of
mankind
,
they
asked
thee
to
swallow
a
*NL*
dozen
of
toads
,
two
of
lizards
,
and
three
of
adders
;
if
they
wanted
thee
*NL*
to
slay
thy
wife
and
children
with
a
sharp
murderous
scimitar
,
it
would
*NL*
be
no
wonder
for
thee
to
show
thyself
stubborn
and
squeamish
.
But
to
make
*NL*
a
piece
of
work
about
three
thousand
three
hundred
lashes
,
what
every
*NL*
poor
little
charity-boy
gets
every
month
--
it
is
enough
to
amaze
,
*NL*
astonish
,
astound
the
compassionate
bowels
of
all
who
hear
it
,
nay
,
all
*NL*
who
come
to
hear
it
in
the
course
of
time
.
Turn
,
O
miserable
,
*NL*
hard-hearted
animal
,
turn
,
I
say
,
those
timorous
owl
's
eyes
upon
these
of
*NL*
mine
that
are
compared
to
radiant
stars
,
and
thou
wilt
see
them
weeping
*NL*
trickling
streams
and
rills
,
and
tracing
furrows
,
tracks
,
and
paths
over
*NL*
the
fair
fields
of
my
cheeks
.
Let
it
move
thee
,
crafty
,
ill-conditioned
*NL*
monster
,
to
see
my
blooming
youth
--
still
in
its
teens
,
for
I
am
not
yet
*NL*
twenty
--
wasting
and
withering
away
beneath
the
husk
of
a
rude
peasant
*NL*
wench
;
and
if
I
do
not
appear
in
that
shape
now
,
it
is
a
special
favour
*NL*
Senor
Merlin
here
has
granted
me
,
to
the
sole
end
that
my
beauty
may
*NL*
soften
thee
;
for
the
tears
of
beauty
in
distress
turn
rocks
into
cotton
*NL*
and
tigers
into
ewes
.
Lay
on
to
that
hide
of
thine
,
thou
great
untamed
*NL*
brute
,
rouse
up
thy
lusty
vigour
that
only
urges
thee
to
eat
and
eat
,
and
*NL*
set
free
the
softness
of
my
flesh
,
the
gentleness
of
my
nature
,
and
the
*NL*
fairness
of
my
face
.
And
if
thou
wilt
not
relent
or
come
to
reason
for
*NL*
me
,
do
so
for
the
sake
of
that
poor
knight
thou
hast
beside
thee
;
thy
*NL*
master
I
mean
,
whose
soul
I
can
this
moment
see
,
how
he
has
it
stuck
in
*NL*
his
throat
not
ten
fingers
from
his
lips
,
and
only
waiting
for
thy
*NL*
inflexible
or
yielding
reply
to
make
its
escape
by
his
mouth
or
go
back
*NL*
again
into
his
stomach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
on
hearing
this
felt
his
throat
,
and
turning
to
the
duke
he
*NL*
said
,
``
By
God
,
senor
,
Dulcinea
says
true
,
I
have
my
soul
stuck
here
in
my
*NL*
throat
like
the
nut
of
a
crossbow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say
you
to
this
,
Sancho
?
''
said
the
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
senora
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
what
I
said
before
;
as
for
the
lashes
,
*NL*
abernuncio
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Abrenuncio
,
you
should
say
,
Sancho
,
and
not
as
you
do
,
''
said
the
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
,
your
highness
,
''
said
Sancho
.
``
I
'm
not
in
a
humour
now
to
*NL*
look
into
niceties
or
a
letter
more
or
less
,
for
these
lashes
that
are
to
*NL*
be
given
me
,
or
I
'm
to
give
myself
,
have
so
upset
me
,
that
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
I
'm
saying
or
doing
.
But
I
'd
like
to
know
of
this
lady
,
my
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
where
she
learned
this
way
she
has
of
asking
*NL*
favours
.
She
comes
to
ask
me
to
score
my
flesh
with
lashes
,
and
she
calls
*NL*
me
soul
of
a
pitcher
,
and
great
untamed
brute
,
and
a
string
of
foul
names
*NL*
that
the
devil
is
welcome
to
.
Is
my
flesh
brass
?
or
is
it
anything
to
me
*NL*
whether
she
is
enchanted
or
not
?
Does
she
bring
with
her
a
basket
of
fair
*NL*
linen
,
shirts
,
kerchiefs
,
socks-not
that
wear
any
--
to
coax
me
?
No
,
*NL*
nothing
but
one
piece
of
abuse
after
another
,
though
she
knows
the
*NL*
proverb
they
have
here
that
`
an
ass
loaded
with
gold
goes
lightly
up
a
*NL*
mountain
,
'
and
that
`
gifts
break
rocks
,
'
and
`
praying
to
God
and
plying
*NL*
the
hammer
,
'
and
that
`
one
``
take
''
is
better
than
two
``
I
'll
give
thee
's
.
''
'
*NL*
Then
there
's
my
master
,
who
ought
to
stroke
me
down
and
pet
me
to
make
me
*NL*
turn
wool
and
carded
cotton
;
he
says
if
he
gets
hold
of
me
he
'll
tie
me
*NL*
naked
to
a
tree
and
double
the
tale
of
lashes
on
me
.
These
tender-hearted
*NL*
gentry
should
consider
that
it
's
not
merely
a
squire
,
but
a
governor
they
*NL*
are
asking
to
whip
himself
;
just
as
if
it
was

with

coat

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
the
fact
is
,
friend
Sancho

''
said
the
duke
,
``
that
unless
you
*NL*
become
softer
than
a

fig

you
shall
not

It
would
be

send

In

short
,
Sancho
,
either
you

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor

Sancho

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Merlin
;
``
here

this

return
to

Montesinos

to
her
former
condition
of
peasant
wench

else
in

form
shall
be
carried

remain
waiting

is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
Sancho

said
the
duchess
,
``
show
courage

gratitude

*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Sancho
replied
with
an
irrelevant
remark
,
which
,
addressing
*NL*
Merlin
,
he
made
to
him
,
``
Will
your
worship
tell
me
,
Senor
Merlin
--
when
*NL*
that
courier
devil
came
up
he
gave
my

a
message
from
Senor
*NL*
Montesinos
,
charging
him
to
wait
for
him
here
,
as
he
was
coming
to
*NL*
arrange
how
the
lady
Dona
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
was
to
be
disenchanted
;
but
*NL*
up
to
the
present
we
have
not
seen
Montesinos
,
nor
anything
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Merlin
made
answer
,
``
The
devil
,
Sancho
,
is
a
blockhead
and
a
*NL*
great
scoundrel
;
I
sent
him
to
look
for
your
master
,
but
not
with
a
*NL*
message
from
Montesinos
but
from
myself
;
for
Montesinos
is
in
his
cave
*NL*
expecting
,
or
more
properly
speaking
,
waiting
for
his
disenchantment
;
for
*NL*
there
's
the
tail
to
be
skinned
yet
for
him
;
if
he
owes
you
anything
,
or
*NL*
you
have
any
business
to
transact
with
him
,
I
'll
bring
him
to
you
and
put
*NL*
him
where
you
choose
;
but
for
the
present
make
up
your
mind
to
consent
to
*NL*
this
penance
,
and
believe
me
it
will
be
very
good
for
you
,
for
soul
as
*NL*
well
for
body
--
for
your
soul
because
of
the
charity
with
which
you
*NL*
perform
it
,
for
your
body
because
I
know
that
you
are
of
a
sanguine
habit
*NL*
and
it
will
do
you
no
harm
to
draw
a
little
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
a
great
many
doctors
in
the
world
;
even
the
enchanters
are
*NL*
doctors
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
however
,
as
everybody
tells
me
the
same
*NL*
thing
--
though
I
ca
n't
see
it
myself
--
I
say
I
am
willing
to
give
myself
*NL*
the
three
thousand
three
hundred
lashes
,
provided
I
am
to
lay
them
on
*NL*
whenever
I
like
,
without
any
fixing
of
days
or
times
;
and
I
'll
try
and
*NL*
get
out
of
debt
as
quickly
as
I
can
,
that
the
world
may
enjoy
the
beauty
*NL*
of
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
;
as
it
seems
,
contrary
to
what
I
thought
,
*NL*
that
she
is
beautiful
after
all
.
It
must
be
a
condition
,
too
,
that
I
am
*NL*
not
to
be
bound
to
draw
blood
with
the
scourge
,
and
that
if
any
of
the
*NL*
lashes
happen
to
be
fly-flappers
they
are
to
count

Item
,
that
,
in
case
I
*NL*
should
make
any
mistake
in
the
reckoning
,
Senor
Merlin
,
as
he
knows
*NL*
everything
,
is
to
keep
count
,
and
let
me
know
how
many
are
still
wanting
*NL*
or
over
the
number
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
will
be
no
need
to
let
you
know
of
any
over
,
''
said
Merlin
,
*NL*
``
because
,
when
you
reach
the
full
number
,
the
lady
Dulcinea
will
at
once
,
*NL*
and
that
very
instant
,
be
disenchanted
,
and
will
come
in
her
gratitude
to
*NL*
seek
out
the
worthy
Sancho
,
and
thank
him
,
and
even
reward
him
for
the
*NL*
good
work
.
So
you
have
no
cause
to
be
uneasy
about
stripes
too
many
or
*NL*
too
few
;
heaven
forbid
I
should
cheat
anyone
of
even
a
hair
of
his
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
in
God
's
hands
be
it
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
in
the
hard
case
I
'm
in
*NL*
I
give
in
;
I
say
I
accept
the
penance
on
the
conditions
laid
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
Sancho
uttered
these
last
words
the
music
of
the
clarions
*NL*
struck
up
once
more
,
and
again
a
host
of
muskets
were
discharged
,
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
hung
on
Sancho
's
neck
kissing
him
again
and
again
on
the
forehead
*NL*
and
cheeks
.
The
duchess
and
the
duke
expressed
the
greatest
satisfaction
,
*NL*
the
car
began
to
move
on
,
and
as
it
passed
the
fair
Dulcinea
bowed
to
the
*NL*
duke
and
duchess
and
made
a
low
curtsey
to
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
bright
smiling
dawn
came
on
apace
;
the
flowers
of
the
field
,
*NL*
revived
,
raised
up
their
heads
,
and
the
crystal
waters
of
the
brooks
,
*NL*
murmuring
over
the
grey
and
white
pebbles
,
hastened
to
pay
their
tribute
*NL*
to
the
expectant
rivers
;
the
glad
earth
,
the
unclouded
sky
,
the
fresh
*NL*
breeze
,
the
clear
light
,
each
and
all
showed
that
the
day
that
came
*NL*
treading
on
the
skirts
of
morning
would
be
calm
and
bright
.
The
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
,
pleased
with
their
hunt
and
at
having
carried
out
their
plans
so
*NL*
cleverly
and
successfully
,
returned
to
their
castle
resolved
to
follow
up
*NL*
their
joke

for

them
there
was
no

*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
RELATED
THE
STRANGE
AND
UNDREAMT-OF
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
*NL*
DISTRESSED
DUENNA
,
ALIAS
THE
COUNTESS
TRIFALDI
,
TOGETHER
WITH
A
LETTER
*NL*
WHICH
SANCHO
PANZA
WROTE
TO
HIS
WIFE
,
TERESA
PANZA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
had
a
majordomo
of
a
very
facetious
and
sportive
turn
,
and
he
it
*NL*
was
that
played
the
part
of
Merlin
,
made
all
the
arrangements
for
the
*NL*
late
adventure
,
composed
the
verses
,
and
got
a
page
to
represent
*NL*
Dulcinea
;
and
now
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
master
and
mistress
,
he
got
*NL*
up
another
of
the
drollest
and
strangest
contrivances
that
can
be
*NL*
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
asked
Sancho
the
next
day
if
he
had
made
a
beginning
with
his
*NL*
penance
task
which
he
had
to
perform
for
the
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
.
*NL*
He
said
he
had
,
and
had
given
himself
five
lashes
overnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
asked
him
what
he
had
given
them
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
is
more
like
giving
oneself
slaps
than
lashes
;
*NL*
I
am
sure
the
sage
Merlin
will
not
be
satisfied
with
such
tenderness
;
*NL*
worthy
Sancho
must
make
a
scourge
with
claws
,
or
a
cat-o
'
-
nine
tails
,
*NL*
that
will
make
itself
felt
;
for
it
's
with
blood
that
letters
enter
,
and
*NL*
the
release
of
so
great
a
lady
as
Dulcinea
will
not
be
granted
so
*NL*
cheaply
,
or
at
such
a
paltry
price
;
and
remember
,
Sancho
,
that
works
of
*NL*
charity
done
in
a
lukewarm
and
half-hearted
way
are
without
merit
and
of
*NL*
no
avail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
replied
,
``
If
your
ladyship
will
give
me
a
proper
scourge
*NL*
or
cord
,
I
'll
lay
on
with
it
,
provided
it
does
not
hurt
too
much
;
for
you
*NL*
must
know
,
boor
as
I
am
,
my
flesh
is
more
cotton
than
hemp
,
and
it
wo
n't
*NL*
do
for
me
to
destroy
myself
for
the
good
of
anybody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
by
all
means
,
''
said
the
duchess
;
``
tomorrow
I
'll
give
you
a
*NL*
scourge
that
will
be
just
the
thing
for
you
,
and
will
accommodate
itself
*NL*
to
the
tenderness
of
your
flesh
,
as
if
it
was
its
own
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
said
Sancho
,
``
Your
highness
must
know
,
dear
lady
of
my
soul
,
that
I
*NL*
have
a
letter
written
to
my
wife
,
Teresa
Panza
,
giving
her
an
account
of
*NL*
all
that
has
happened
me
since
I
left
her
;
I
have
it
here
in
my
bosom
,
*NL*
and
there
's
nothing
wanting
but
to
put
the
address
to
it
;
I
'd
be
glad
if
*NL*
your
discretion
would
read
it
,
for
I
think
it
runs
in
the
governor
style
;
*NL*
I
mean
the
way
governors
ought
to
write
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
dictated
it
?
''
asked
the
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
should
have
dictated
but
myself
,
sinner
as
I
am
?
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
write
it
yourself
?
''
said
the
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
did
n't
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
I
can
neither
read
nor
write
,
though
I
*NL*
can
sign
my
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
it
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
for
never
fear
but
you
display
in
it
*NL*
the
quality
and
quantity
of
your
wit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
drew
out
an
open
letter
from
his
bosom
,
and
the
duchess
,
taking
*NL*
it
,
found
it
ran
in
this
fashion
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SANCHO
PANZA
'S
LETTER
TO
HIS
WIFE
,
TERESA
PANZA
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
was
well
whipped
I
went
mounted
like
a
gentleman
;
if
I
have
got
a
*NL*
good
government
it
is
at
the
cost
of
a
good
whipping
.
Thou
wilt
not
*NL*
understand
this
just
now
,
my
Teresa
;
by-and-by
thou
wilt
know
what
it
*NL*
means
.
I
may
tell
thee
,
Teresa
,
I
mean
thee
to
go
in
a
coach
,
for
that
is
*NL*
a
matter
of
importance
,
because
every
other
way
of
going
is
going
on
*NL*
all-fours
.
Thou
art
a
governor
's
wife
;
take
care
that
nobody
speaks
evil
*NL*
of
thee
behind
thy
back
.
I
send
thee
here
a
green
hunting
suit
that
my
*NL*
lady
the
duchess
gave
me
;
alter
it
so
as
to
make
a
petticoat
and
bodice
*NL*
for
our
daughter
.
Don
Quixote
,
my
master
,
if
I
am
to
believe
what
I
hear
*NL*
in
these
parts
,
is
a
madman
of
some
sense
,
and
a
droll
blockhead
,
and
I
*NL*
am
no
way
behind
him
.
We
have
been
in
the
cave
of
Montesinos
,
and
the
*NL*
sage
Merlin
has
laid
hold
of
me
for
the
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
del
*NL*
Toboso
,
her
that
is
called
Aldonza
Lorenzo
over
there
.
With
three
*NL*
thousand
three
hundred
lashes
,
less
five
,
that
I
'm
to
give
myself
,
she
*NL*
will
be
left
as
entirely
disenchanted
as
the
mother
that
bore
her
.
Say
*NL*
nothing
of
this
to
anyone
;
for
,
make
thy
affairs
public
,
and
some
will
*NL*
say
they
are
white
and
others
will
say
they
are
black
.
I
shall
leave
this
*NL*
in
a
few
days
for
my
government
,
to
which
I
am
going
with
a
mighty
great
*NL*
desire
to
make
money
,
for
they
tell
me
all
new
governors
set
out
with
the
*NL*
same
desire
;
I
will
feel
the
pulse
of
it
and
will
let
thee
know
if
thou
*NL*
art
to
come
and
live
with
me
or
not
.
Dapple
is
well
and
sends
many
*NL*
remembrances
to
thee
;
I
am
not
going
to
leave
him
behind
though
they
took
*NL*
me
away
to
be
Grand
Turk
.
My
lady
the
duchess
kisses
thy
hands
a
thousand
*NL*
times
;
do
thou
make
a
return
with
two
thousand
,
for
as
my
master
says
,
*NL*
nothing
costs
less
or
is
cheaper
than
civility
.
God
has
not
been
pleased
*NL*
to
provide
another
valise
for
me
with
another
hundred
crowns
,
like
the
*NL*
one
the
other
day
;
but
never
mind
,
my
Teresa
,
the
bell-ringer
is
in
safe
*NL*
quarters
,
and
all
will
come
out
in
the
scouring
of
the
government
;
only
*NL*
it
troubles
me
greatly
what
they
tell
me
--
that
once
I
have
tasted
it
I
*NL*
will
eat
my
hands
off
after
it
;
and
if
that
is
so
it
will
not
come
very
*NL*
cheap
to
me
;
though
to
be
sure
the
maimed
have
a
benefice
of
their
own
in
*NL*
the
alms
they
beg
for
;
so
that
one
way
or
another
thou
wilt
be
rich
and
*NL*
in
luck
.
God
give
it
to
thee
as
he
can
,
and
keep
me
to
serve
thee
.

*NL*
Thy
husband

SANCHO
PANZA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
done
reading
the
letter
the
duchess
said
to
Sancho
,
``
On
two
*NL*
points
the
worthy
governor
goes
rather
astray
;
one
is
in
saying
or
*NL*
hinting
that
this
government
has
been
bestowed
upon
him
for
the
lashes
*NL*
that
he
is
to
give
himself
,
when
he
knows
-LRB-
and
he
can
not
deny
it
-RRB-
that
*NL*
when
my
lord
the
duke
promised
it
to
him
nobody
ever
dreamt
of
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
lashes
;
the
other
is
that
he
shows
himself
here
to
be
very
*NL*
covetous
;
and
I
would
not
have
him
a
money-seeker
,
for
`
covetousness
*NL*
bursts
the
bag
,
'
and
the
covetous
governor
does
ungoverned
justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
it
that
way
,
senora
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
if
you
think
the
*NL*
letter
does
n't
run
as
it
ought
to
do
,
it
's
only
to
tear
it
up
and
make
*NL*
another
;
and
maybe
it
will
be
a
worse
one
if
it
is
left
to
my
gumption
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
this
one
will
do
,
and
I
wish
the
duke
to
see
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
they
betook
themselves
to
a
garden
where
they
were
to
dine
,
and
*NL*
the
duchess
showed
Sancho
's
letter
to
the
duke
,
who
was
highly
delighted
*NL*
with
it
.
They
dined
,
and
after
the
cloth
had
been
removed
and
they
had
*NL*
amused
themselves
for
a
while
with
Sancho
's
rich
conversation
,
the
*NL*
melancholy
sound
of
a
fife
and
harsh
discordant
drum
made
itself
heard
.
*NL*
All
seemed
somewhat
put
out
by
this
dull
,
confused
,
martial
harmony
,
*NL*
especially
Don
Quixote
,
who
could
not
keep
his
seat
from
pure
*NL*
disquietude
;
as
to
Sancho
,
it
is
needless
to
say
that
fear
drove
him
to
*NL*
his
usual
refuge
,
the
side
or
the
skirts
of
the
duchess
;
and
indeed
and
*NL*
in
truth
the
sound
they
heard
was
a
most
doleful
and
melancholy
one
.
*NL*
While
they
were
still
in
uncertainty
they
saw
advancing
towards
them
*NL*
through
the
garden
two
men
clad
in
mourning
robes
so
long
and
flowing
*NL*
that
they
trailed
upon
the
ground
.
As
they
marched
they
beat
two
great
*NL*
drums
which
were
likewise
draped
in
black
,
and
beside
them
came
the
fife
*NL*
player
,
black
and
sombre
like
the
others
.
Following
these
came
a
*NL*
personage
of
gigantic
stature
enveloped
rather
than
clad
in
a
gown
of
the
*NL*
deepest
black
,
the
skirt
of
which
was
of
prodigious
dimensions
.
Over
the
*NL*
gown
,
girdling
or
crossing
his
figure
,
he
had
a
broad
baldric
which
was
*NL*
also
black
,
and
from
which
hung
a
huge
scimitar
with
a
black
scabbard
and
*NL*
furniture
.
He
had
his
face
covered
with
a
transparent
black
veil
,
through
*NL*
which
might
be
descried
a
very
long
beard
as
white
as
snow
.
He
came
on
*NL*
keeping
step
to
the
sound
of
the
drums
with
great
gravity
and
dignity
;
*NL*
and
,
in
short
,
his
stature
,
his
gait
,
the
sombreness
of
his
appearance
*NL*
and
his
following
might
well
have
struck
with
astonishment
,
as
they
did
,
*NL*
all
who
beheld
him
without
knowing
who
he
was
.
With
this
measured
pace
*NL*
and
in
this
guise
he
advanced
to
kneel
before
the
duke
,
who
,
with
the
*NL*
others
,
awaited
him
standing
.
The
duke
,
however
,
would
not
on
any
account
*NL*
allow
him
to
speak
until
he
had
risen
.
The
prodigious
scarecrow
obeyed
,
*NL*
and
standing
up
,
removed
the
veil
from
his
face
and
disclosed
the
most
*NL*
enormous
,
the
longest
,
the
whitest
and
the
thickest
beard
that
human
eyes
*NL*
had
ever
beheld
until
that
moment
,
and
then
fetching
up
a
grave
,
sonorous
*NL*
voice
from
the
depths
of
his
broad
,
capacious
chest
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
*NL*
on
the
duke
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
high
and
mighty
senor
,
my
name
is
Trifaldin
of
the
White
Beard
;
I
*NL*
am
squire
to
the
Countess
Trifaldi
,
otherwise
called
the
Distressed
*NL*
Duenna
,
on
whose
behalf
I
bear
a
message
to
your
highness
,
which
is
that
*NL*
your
magnificence
will
be
pleased
to
grant
her
leave
and
permission
to
*NL*
come
and
tell
you
her
trouble
,
which
is
one
of
the
strangest
and
most
*NL*
wonderful
that
the
mind
most
familiar
with
trouble
in
the
world
could
*NL*
have
imagined
;
but
first
she
desires
to
know
if
the
valiant
and
never
*NL*
vanquished
knight
,
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
is
in
this
your
castle
,
for
*NL*
she
has
come
in
quest
of
him
on
foot
and
without
breaking
her
fast
from
*NL*
the
kingdom
of
Kandy
to
your
realms
here
;
a
thing
which
may
and
ought
to
*NL*
be
regarded
as
a
miracle
or
set
down
to
enchantment
;
she
is
even
now
at
*NL*
the
gate
of
this
fortress
or
plaisance
,
and
only
waits
for
your
*NL*
permission
to
enter
.
I
have
spoken
.
''
And
with
that
he
coughed
,
and
*NL*
stroked
down
his
beard
with
both
his
hands
,
and
stood
very
tranquilly
*NL*
waiting
for
the
response
of
the
duke
,
which
was
to
this
effect
:
``
Many
*NL*
days
ago
,
worthy
squire
Trifaldin
of
the
White
Beard
,
we
heard
of
the
*NL*
misfortune
of
my
lady
the
Countess
Trifaldi
,
whom
the
enchanters
have
*NL*
caused
to
be
called
the
Distressed
Duenna
.
Bid
her
enter
,
O
stupendous
*NL*
squire
,
and
tell
her
that
the
valiant
knight
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
is
*NL*
here
,
and
from
his
generous
disposition
she
may
safely
promise
herself
*NL*
every
protection
and
assistance
;
and
you
may
tell
her
,
too
,
that
if
my
*NL*
aid
be
necessary
it
will
not
be
withheld
,
for
I
am
bound
to
give
it
to
*NL*
her
by
my
quality
of
knight
,
which
involves
the
protection
of
women
of
*NL*
all
sorts
,
especially
widowed
,
wronged
,
and
distressed
dames
,
such
as
her
*NL*
ladyship
seems
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
Trifaldin
bent
the
knee
to
the
ground
,
and
making
a
sign
*NL*
to
the
fifer
and
drummers
to
strike
up
,
he
turned
and
marched
out
of
the
*NL*
garden
to
the
same
notes
and
at
the
same
pace
as
when
he
entered
,
leaving
*NL*
them
all
amazed
at
his
bearing
and
solemnity
.
Turning
to
Don
Quixote
,
the
*NL*
duke
said
,
``
After
all
,
renowned
knight
,
the
mists
of
malice
and
ignorance
*NL*
are
unable
to
hide
or
obscure
the
light
of
valour
and
virtue
.
I
say
so
,
*NL*
because
your
excellence
has
been
barely
six
days
in
this
castle
,
and
*NL*
already
the
unhappy
and
the
afflicted
come
in
quest
of
you
from
lands
far
*NL*
distant
and
remote
,
and
not
in
coaches
or
on
dromedaries
,
but
on
foot
and
*NL*
fasting
,
confident
that
in
that
mighty
arm
they
will
find
a
cure
for
*NL*
their
sorrows
and
troubles
;
thanks
to
your
great
achievements
,
which
are
*NL*
circulated
all
over
the
known
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
senor
duke
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
blessed
ecclesiastic
,
*NL*
who
at
table
the
other
day
showed
such
ill-will
and
bitter
spite
against
*NL*
knights-errant
,
were
here
now
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
whether
knights
of
*NL*
the
sort
are
needed
in
the
world
;
he
would
at
any
rate
learn
by
*NL*
experience
that
those
suffering
any
extraordinary
affliction
or
sorrow
,
*NL*
in
extreme
cases
and
unusual
misfortunes
do
not
go
to
look
for
a
remedy
*NL*
to
the
houses
of
jurists
or
village
sacristans
,
or
to
the
knight
who
has
*NL*
never
attempted
to
pass
the
bounds
of
his
own
town
,
or
to
the
indolent
*NL*
courtier
who
only
seeks
for
news
to
repeat
and
talk
of
,
instead
of
*NL*
striving
to
do
deeds

exploits

Relief

in
distress

consolation

in
no

in

unceasing

regard
any

honourable

endured
to
good

Let
this

come
*NL*
and
ask
what

I
will
effect
her
relief

CHAPTER
XXXVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
CONTINUED
THE
NOTABLE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
DISTRESSED
DUENNA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
and
duchess
were
extremely
glad
to
see
how
readily
Don
Quixote
*NL*
fell
in
with
their
scheme
;
but
at
this
moment
Sancho
observed
,
``
I
hope
*NL*
this
senora
duenna
wo
n't
be
putting
any
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
*NL*
promise
of
my
government
;
for
I
have
heard
a
Toledo
apothecary
,
who
*NL*
talked
like
a
goldfinch
,
say
that
where
duennas
were
mixed
up
nothing
*NL*
good
could
happen
.
God
bless
me
,
how
he
hated
them
,
that
same
apothecary
!
*NL*
And
so
what
I
'm
thinking
is
,
if
all
duennas
,
of
whatever
sort
or
*NL*
condition
they
may
be
,
are
plagues
and
busybodies
,
what
must
they
be
that
*NL*
are
distressed
,
like
this
Countess
Three-skirts
or
Three-tails
!
--
for
in
*NL*
my
country
skirts
or
tails
,
tails
or
skirts
,
it
's
all
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
friend
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
since
this
lady
duenna
comes
in
*NL*
quest
of
me
from
such
a
distant
land
she
can
not
be
one
of
those
the
*NL*
apothecary
meant
;
moreover
this
is
a
countess
,
and
when
countesses
serve
*NL*
as
duennas
it
is
in
the
service
of
queens
and
empresses
,
for
in
their
own
*NL*
houses
they
are
mistresses
paramount
and
have
other
duennas
to
wait
on
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Dona
Rodriguez
,
who
was
present
,
made
answer
,
``
My
lady
the
*NL*
duchess
has
duennas
in
her
service
that
might
be
countesses
if
it
was
the
*NL*
will
of
fortune
;
`
but
laws
go
as
kings
like
;
'
let
nobody
speak
ill
of
*NL*
duennas
,
above
all
of
ancient
maiden
ones
;
for
though
I
am
not
one
*NL*
myself
,
I
know
and
am
aware
of
the
advantage
a
maiden
duenna
has
over
one
*NL*
that
is
a
widow
;
but
`
he
who
clipped
us
has
kept
the
scissors
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
there
's
so
much
to
be
clipped
about
*NL*
duennas
,
so
my
barber
said
,
that
`
it
will
be
better
not
to
stir
the
rice
*NL*
even
though
it
sticks
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
squires
,
''
returned
Dona
Rodriguez
,
``
are
always
our
enemies
;
and
as
*NL*
they
are
the
haunting
spirits
of
the
antechambers
and
watch
us
at
every
*NL*
step
,
whenever
they
are
not
saying
their
prayers
-LRB-
and
that
's
often
*NL*
enough
-RRB-
they
spend
their
time
in
tattling
about
us
,
digging
up
our
bones
*NL*
and
burying
our
good
name
.
But
I
can
tell
these
walking
blocks
that
we
*NL*
will
live
in
spite
of
them
,
and
in
great
houses
too
,
though
we
die
of
*NL*
hunger
and
cover
our
flesh
,
be
it
delicate
or
not
,
with
widow
's
weeds
,
as
*NL*
one
covers
or
hides
a
dunghill
on
a
procession
day
.
By
my
faith
,
if
it
*NL*
were
permitted
me
and
time
allowed
,
I
could
prove
,
not
only
to
those
here
*NL*
present
,
but
to
all
the
world
,
that
there
is
no
virtue
that
is
not
to
be
*NL*
found
in
a
duenna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
that
my
good
Dona
Rodriguez
is
*NL*
right
,
and
very
much
so
;
but
she
had
better
bide
her
time
for
fighting
*NL*
her
own
battle
and
that
of
the
rest
of
the
duennas
,
so
as
to
crush
the
*NL*
calumny
of
that
vile
apothecary
,
and
root
out
the
prejudice
in
the
great
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
's
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
replied
,
``
Ever
since
I
have
sniffed
the
governorship
I
*NL*
have
got
rid
of
the
humours
of
a
squire
,
and
I
do
n't
care
a
wild
fig
for
*NL*
all
the
duennas
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
would
have
carried
on
this
duenna
dispute
further
had
they
not
heard
*NL*
the
notes
of
the
fife
and
drums
once
more
,
from
which
they
concluded
that
*NL*
the
Distressed
Duenna
was
making
her
entrance
.
The
duchess
asked
the
duke
*NL*
if
it
would
be
proper
to
go
out
to
receive
her
,
as
she
was
a
countess
and
*NL*
a
person
of
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
respect
of
her
being
a
countess
,
''
said
Sancho
,
before
the
duke
could
*NL*
reply
,
``
I
am
for
your
highnesses
going
out
to
receive
her
;
but
in
respect
*NL*
of
her
being
a
duenna
,
it
is
my
opinion
you
should
not
stir
a
step
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
bade
thee
meddle
in
this
,
Sancho
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
senor
?
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
meddle
for
I
have
a
right
to
meddle
,
as
a
*NL*
squire
who
has
learned
the
rules
of
courtesy
in
the
school
of
your
*NL*
worship
,
the
most
courteous
and
best-bred
knight
in
the
whole
world
of
*NL*
courtliness
;
and
in
these
things
,
as
I
have
heard
your
worship
say
,
as
*NL*
much
is
lost
by
a
card
too
many
as
by
a
card
too
few
,
and
to
one
who
has
*NL*
his
ears
open
,
few
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sancho
is
right
,
''
said
the
duke
;
``
we
'll
see
what
the
countess
is
like
,
*NL*
and
by
that
measure
the
courtesy
that
is
due
to
her

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
TOLD
THE
DISTRESSED
DUENNA
'S
TALE
OF
HER
MISFORTUNES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Following
the
melancholy
musicians
there
filed
into
the
garden
as
many
as
*NL*
twelve
duennas
,
in
two
lines
,
all
dressed
in
ample
mourning
robes
*NL*
apparently
of
milled
serge
,
with
hoods
of
fine
white
gauze
so
long
that
*NL*
they
allowed
only
the
border
of
the
robe
to
be
seen
.
Behind
them
came
the
*NL*
Countess
Trifaldi
,
the
squire
Trifaldin
of
the
White
Beard
leading
her
by
*NL*
the
hand
,
clad
in
the
finest
unnapped
black
baize
,
such
that
,
had
it
a
*NL*
nap
,
every
tuft
would
have
shown
as
big
as
a
Martos
chickpea
;
the
tail
,
*NL*
or
skirt
,
or
whatever
it
might
be
called
,
ended
in
three
points
which
*NL*
were
borne
up
by
the
hands
of
three
pages
,
likewise
dressed
in
mourning
,
*NL*
forming
an
elegant
geometrical
figure
with
the
three
acute
angles
made
by
*NL*
the
three
points
,
from
which
all
who
saw
the
peaked
skirt
concluded
that
*NL*
it
must
be
because
of
it
the
countess
was
called
Trifaldi
,
as
though
it
*NL*
were
Countess
of
the
Three
Skirts
;
and
Benengeli
says
it
was
so
,
and
that
*NL*
by
her
right
name
she
was
called
the
Countess
Lobuna
,
because
wolves
bred
*NL*
in
great
numbers
in
her
country
;
and
if
,
instead
of
wolves
,
they
had
been
*NL*
foxes
,
she
would
have
been
called
the
Countess
Zorruna
,
as
it
was
the
*NL*
custom
in
those
parts
for
lords
to
take
distinctive
titles
from
the
thing
*NL*
or
things
most
abundant
in
their
dominions
;
this
countess
,
however
,
in
*NL*
honour
of
the
new
fashion
of
her
skirt
,
dropped
Lobuna
and
took
up
*NL*
Trifaldi
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
twelve
duennas
and
the
lady
came
on
at
procession
pace
,
their
faces
*NL*
being
covered
with
black
veils
,
not
transparent
ones
like
Trifaldin
's
,
*NL*
but
so
close
that
they
allowed
nothing
to
be
seen
through
them
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
the
band
of
duennas
was
fully
in
sight
,
the
duke
,
the
duchess
,
and
Don
*NL*
Quixote
stood
up
,
as
well
as
all
who
were
watching
the
slow-moving
*NL*
procession
.
The
twelve
duennas
halted
and
formed
a
lane
,
along
which
the
*NL*
Distressed
One
advanced
,
Trifaldin
still
holding
her
hand
.
On
seeing
this
*NL*
the
duke
,
the
duchess
,
and
Don
Quixote
went
some
twelve
paces
forward
to
*NL*
meet
her
.
She
then
,
kneeling
on
the
ground
,
said
in
a
voice
hoarse
and
*NL*
rough
,
rather
than
fine
and
delicate
,
``
May
it
please
your
highnesses
not
*NL*
to
offer
such
courtesies
to
this
your
servant
,
I
should
say
to
this
your
*NL*
handmaid
,
for
I
am
in
such
distress
that
I
shall
never
be
able
to
make
a
*NL*
proper
return
,
because
my
strange
and
unparalleled
misfortune
has
carried
*NL*
off
my
wits
,
and
I
know
not
whither
;
but
it
must
be
a
long
way
off
,
for
*NL*
the
more
I
look
for
them
the
less
I
find
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
be
wanting
in
wits
,
senora
countess
,
''
said
the
duke
,
``
who
did
*NL*
not
perceive
your
worth
by
your
person
,
for
at
a
glance
it
may
be
seen
it
*NL*
deserves
all
the
cream
of
courtesy
and
flower
of
polite
usage
;
''
and
*NL*
raising
her
up
by
the
hand
he
led
her
to
a
seat
beside
the
duchess
,
who
*NL*
likewise
received
her
with
great
urbanity
.
Don
Quixote
remained
silent
,
*NL*
while
Sancho
was
dying
to
see
the
features
of
Trifaldi
and
one
or
two
of
*NL*
her
many
duennas
;
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
it
until
they
*NL*
themselves
displayed
them
of
their
own
accord
and
free
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
kept
still
,
waiting
to
see
who
would
break
silence
,
which
the
*NL*
Distressed
Duenna
did
in
these
words
:
``
I
am
confident
,
most
mighty
lord
,
*NL*
most
fair
lady
,
and
most
discreet
company
,
that
my
most
miserable
misery
*NL*
will
be
accorded
a
reception
no
less
dispassionate
than
generous
and
*NL*
condolent
in
your
most
valiant
bosoms
,
for
it
is
one
that
is
enough
to
*NL*
melt
marble
,
soften
diamonds
,
and
mollify
the
steel
of
the
most
hardened
*NL*
hearts
in
the
world
;
but
ere
it
is
proclaimed
to
your
hearing
,
not
to
say
*NL*
your
ears
,
I
would
fain
be
enlightened
whether
there
be
present
in
this
*NL*
society
,
circle
,
or
company
,
that
knight
immaculatissimus
,
Don
Quixote
de
*NL*
la
Manchissima
,
and
his
squirissimus
Panza
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Panza
is
here
,
''
said
Sancho
,
before
anyone
could
reply
,
``
and
Don
*NL*
Quixotissimus
too
;
and
so
,
most
distressedest
Duenissima
,
you
may
say
*NL*
what
you
willissimus
,
for
we
are
all
readissimus
to
do
you
any
*NL*
servissimus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
Don
Quixote
rose
,
and
addressing
the
Distressed
Duenna
,
said
,
``
If
*NL*
your
sorrows
,
afflicted
lady
,
can
indulge
in
any
hope
of
relief
from
the
*NL*
valour
or
might
of
any
knight-errant
,
here
are
mine
,
which
,
feeble
and
*NL*
limited
though
they
be
,
shall
be
entirely
devoted
to
your
service
.
I
am
*NL*
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
whose
calling
it
is
to
give
aid
to
the
needy
of
*NL*
all
sorts
;
and
that
being
so
,
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
,
senora
,
to
*NL*
make
any
appeal
to
benevolence
,
or
deal
in
preambles
,
only
to
tell
your
*NL*
woes
plainly
and
straightforwardly
:
for
you
have
hearers
that
will
know
*NL*
how
,
if
not
to
remedy
them
,
to
sympathise
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
,
the
Distressed
Duenna
made
as
though
she
would
throw
*NL*
herself
at
Don
Quixote
's
feet
,
and
actually
did
fall
before
them
and
*NL*
said
,
as
she
strove
to
embrace
them
,
``
Before
these
feet
and
legs
I
cast
*NL*
myself
,
O
unconquered
knight
,
as
before
,
what
they
are
,
the
foundations
*NL*
and
pillars
of
knight-errantry
;
these
feet
I
desire
to
kiss
,
for
upon
*NL*
their
steps
hangs
and
depends
the
sole
remedy
for
my
misfortune
,
O
*NL*
valorous
errant
,
whose
veritable
achievements
leave
behind
and
eclipse
*NL*
the
fabulous
ones
of
the
Amadises
,
Esplandians
,
and
Belianises
!
''
Then
*NL*
turning
from
Don
Quixote
to
Sancho
Panza
,
and
grasping
his
hands
,
she
*NL*
said
,
``
O
thou
,
most
loyal
squire
that
ever
served
knight-errant
in
this
*NL*
present
age
or
ages
past
,
whose
goodness
is
more
extensive
than
the
beard
*NL*
of
Trifaldin
my
companion
here
of
present
,
well
mayest
thou
boast
thyself
*NL*
that
,
in
serving
the
great
Don
Quixote
,
thou
art
serving
,
summed
up
in
*NL*
one
,
the
whole
host
of
knights
that
have
ever
borne
arms
in
the
world
.
I
*NL*
conjure
thee
,
by
what
thou
owest
to
thy
most
loyal
goodness
,
that
thou
*NL*
wilt
become
my
kind
intercessor
with
thy
master
,
that
he
speedily
give
*NL*
aid
to
this
most
humble
and
most
unfortunate
countess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Sancho
made
answer
,
``
As
to
my
goodness
,
senora
,
being
as
long
and
*NL*
as
great
as
your
squire
's
beard
,
it
matters
very
little
to
me
;
may
I
have
*NL*
my
soul
well
bearded
and
moustached
when
it
comes
to
quit
this
life
,
*NL*
that
's
the
point
;
about
beards
here
below
I
care
little
or
nothing
;
but
*NL*
without
all
these
blandishments
and
prayers
,
I
will
beg
my
master
-LRB-
for
I
*NL*
know
he
loves
me
,
and
,
besides
,
he
has
need
of
me
just
now
for
a
certain
*NL*
business
-RRB-
to
help
and
aid
your
worship
as
far
as
he
can
;
unpack
your
woes
*NL*
and
lay
them
before
us
,
and
leave
us
to
deal
with
them
,
for
we
'll
be
all
*NL*
of
one
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
and
duchess
,
as
it
was
they
who
had
made
the
experiment
of
this
*NL*
adventure
,
were
ready
to
burst
with
laughter
at
all
this
,
and
between
*NL*
themselves
they
commended
the
clever
acting
of
the
Trifaldi
,
who
,
*NL*
returning
to
her
seat
,
said
,
``
Queen
Dona
Maguncia
reigned
over
the
famous
*NL*
kingdom
of
Kandy
,
which
lies
between
the
great
Trapobana
and
the
Southern
*NL*
Sea
,
two
leagues
beyond
Cape
Comorin
.
She
was
the
widow
of
King
*NL*
Archipiela
,
her
lord
and
husband
,
and
of
their
marriage
they
had
issue
*NL*
the
Princess
Antonomasia
,
heiress
of
the
kingdom
;
which
Princess
*NL*
Antonomasia
was
reared
and
brought
up
under
my
care
and
direction
,
I
*NL*
being
the
oldest
and
highest
in
rank
of
her
mother
's
duennas
.
Time
*NL*
passed
,
and
the
young
Antonomasia
reached
the
age
of
fourteen
,
and
such
a
*NL*
perfection
of
beauty
,
that
nature
could
not
raise
it
higher
.
Then
,
it
*NL*
must
not
be
supposed
her
intelligence
was
childish
;
she
was
as
*NL*
intelligent
as
she
was
fair
,
and
she
was
fairer
than
all
the
world
;
and
*NL*
is
so
still
,
unless
the
envious
fates
and
hard-hearted
sisters
three
have
*NL*
cut
for
her
the
thread
of
life
.
But
that
they
have
not
,
for
Heaven
will
*NL*
not
suffer
so
great
a
wrong
to
Earth
,
as
it
would
be
to
pluck
unripe
the
*NL*
grapes
of
the
fairest
vineyard
on
its
surface
.
Of
this
beauty
,
to
which
*NL*
my
poor
feeble
tongue
has
failed
to
do
justice
,
countless
princes
,
not
*NL*
only
of
that
country
,
but
of
others
,
were
enamoured
,
and
among
them
a
*NL*
private
gentleman
,
who
was
at
the
court
,
dared
to
raise
his
thoughts
to
*NL*
the
heaven
of
so
great
beauty
,
trusting
to
his
youth
,
his
gallant
*NL*
bearing
,
his
numerous
accomplishments
and
graces
,
and
his
quickness
and
*NL*
readiness
of
wit
;
for
I
may
tell
your
highnesses
,
if
I
am
not
wearying
*NL*
you
,
that
he
played
the
guitar
so
as
to
make
it
speak
,
and
he
was
,
*NL*
besides
,
a
poet
and
a
great
dancer
,
and
he
could
make
birdcages
so
well
,
*NL*
that
by
making
them
alone
he
might
have
gained
a
livelihood
,
had
he
found
*NL*
himself
reduced
to
utter
poverty
;
and
gifts
and
graces
of
this
kind
are
*NL*
enough
to
bring
down
a
mountain
,
not
to
say
a
tender
young
girl
.
But
all
*NL*
his
gallantry
,
wit
,
and
gaiety
,
all
his
graces
and
accomplishments
,
would
*NL*
have
been
of
little
or
no
avail
towards
gaining
the
fortress
of
my
pupil
,
*NL*
had
not
the
impudent
thief
taken
the
precaution
of
gaining
me
over
first
.
*NL*
First
,
the
villain
and
heartless
vagabond
sought
to
win
my
good-will
and
*NL*
purchase
my
compliance
,
so
as
to
get
me
,
like
a
treacherous
warder
,
to
*NL*
deliver
up
to
him
the
keys
of
the
fortress
I
had
in
charge
.
In
a
word
,
he
*NL*
gained
an
influence
over
my
mind
,
and
overcame
my
resolutions
with
I
know
*NL*
not
what
trinkets
and
jewels
he
gave
me
;
but
it
was
some
verses
I
heard
*NL*
him
singing
one
night
from
a
grating
that
opened
on
the
street
where
he
*NL*
lived
,
that
,
more
than
anything
else
,
made
me
give
way
and
led
to
my
*NL*
fall
;
and
if
I
remember
rightly
they
ran
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
sweet
enemy
of
mine
*NL*
My
bleeding
heart
hath
had
its
wound
;
*NL*
And
to
increase
the
pain
I
'm
bound
*NL*
To
suffer
and
to
make
no
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lines
seemed
pearls
to
me
and
his
voice
sweet
as
syrup
;
and
*NL*
afterwards
,
I
may
say
ever
since
then
,
looking
at
the
misfortune
into
*NL*
which
I
have
fallen
,
I
have
thought
that
poets
,
as
Plato
advised
,
ought
*NL*
to
be
banished
from
all
well-ordered
States
;
at
least
the
amatory
ones
,
*NL*
for
they
write
verses
,
not
like
those
of
`
The
Marquis
of
Mantua
,
'
that
*NL*
delight
and
draw
tears
from
the
women
and
children
,
but
sharp-pointed
*NL*
conceits
that
pierce
the
heart
like
soft
thorns
,
and
like
the
lightning
*NL*
strike
it
,
leaving
the
raiment
uninjured
.
Another
time
he
sang
:
*NL*
*NL*
Come
Death
,
so
subtly
veiled
that
I
*NL*
Thy
coming
know
not
,
how
or
when
,
*NL*
Lest
it
should
give
me
life
again
*NL*
To
find
how
sweet
it
is
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
and
other
verses
and
burdens
of
the
same
sort
,
such
as
enchant
when
*NL*
sung
and
fascinate
when
written
.
And
then
,
when
they
condescend
to
*NL*
compose
a
sort
of
verse
that
was
at
that
time
in
vogue
in
Kandy
,
which
*NL*
they
call
seguidillas
!
Then
it
is
that
hearts
leap
and
laughter
breaks
*NL*
forth
,
and
the
body
grows
restless
and
all
the
senses
turn
quicksilver
.
*NL*
And
so
I
say
,
sirs
,
that
these
troubadours
richly
deserve
to
be
banished
*NL*
to
the
isles
of
the
lizards
.
Though
it
is
not
they
that
are
in
fault
,
but
*NL*
the
simpletons
that
extol
them
,
and
the
fools
that
believe
in
them
;
and
*NL*
had
I
been
the
faithful
duenna
I
should
have
been
,
his
stale
conceits
*NL*
would
have
never
moved
me
,
nor
should
I
have
been
taken
in
by
such
*NL*
phrases
as
`
in
death
I
live
,
'
`
in
ice
I
burn
,
'
`
in
flames
I
shiver
,
'
*NL*
`
hopeless
I
hope
,
'
'
I
go
and
stay
,
'
and
paradoxes
of
that
sort
which
*NL*
their
writings
are
full
of
.
And
then
when
they
promise
the
Phoenix
of
*NL*
Arabia
,
the
crown
of
Ariadne
,
the
horses
of
the
Sun
,
the
pearls
of
the
*NL*
South
,
the
gold
of
Tibar
,
and
the
balsam
of
Panchaia
!
Then
it
is
they
*NL*
give
a
loose
to
their
pens
,
for
it
costs
them
little
to
make
promises
*NL*
they
have
no
intention
or
power
of
fulfilling
.
But
where
am
I
wandering
*NL*
to
?
Woe
is
me
,
unfortunate
being
!
What
madness
or
folly
leads
me
to
speak
*NL*
of
the
faults
of
others
,
when
there
is
so
much
to
be
said
about
my
own
?
*NL*
Again
,
woe
is
me
,
hapless
that
I
am
!
it
was
not
verses
that
conquered
me
,
*NL*
but
my
own
simplicity
;
it
was
not
music
made
me
yield
,
but
my
own
*NL*
imprudence
;
my
own
great
ignorance
and
little
caution
opened
the
way
and
*NL*
cleared
the
path
for
Don
Clavijo
's
advances
,
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
*NL*
gentleman
I
have
referred
to
;
and
so
,
with
my
help
as
go-between
,
he
*NL*
found
his
way
many
a
time
into
the
chamber
of
the
deceived
Antonomasia
*NL*
-LRB-
deceived
not
by
him
but
by
me
-RRB-
under
the
title
of
a
lawful
husband
;
for
,
*NL*
sinner
though
I
was
,
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
approach
the
edge
of
*NL*
her
shoe-sole
without
being
her
husband
.
No
,
no
,
not
that
;
marriage
must
*NL*
come
first
in
any
business
of
this
sort
that
I
take
in
hand
.
But
there
*NL*
was
one
hitch
in
this
case
,
which
was
that
of
inequality
of
rank
,
Don
*NL*
Clavijo
being
a
private
gentleman
,
and
the
Princess
Antonomasia
,
as
I
*NL*
said
,
heiress
to
the
kingdom
.
The
entanglement
remained
for
some
time
a
*NL*
secret
,
kept
hidden
by
my
cunning
precautions
,
until
I
perceived
that
a
*NL*
certain
expansion
of
waist
in
Antonomasia
must
before
long
disclose
it
,
*NL*
the
dread
of
which
made
us
all
there
take
counsel
together
,
and
it
was
*NL*
agreed
that
before
the
mischief
came
to
light
,
Don
Clavijo
should
demand
*NL*
Antonomasia
as
his
wife
before
the
Vicar
,
in
virtue
of
an
agreement
to
*NL*
marry
him
made
by
the
princess
,
and
drafted
by
my
wit
in
such
binding
*NL*
terms
that
the
might
of
Samson
could
not
have
broken
it
.
The
necessary
*NL*
steps
were
taken
;
the
Vicar
saw
the
agreement
,
and
took
the
lady
's
*NL*
confession
;
she
confessed
everything
in
full
,
and
he
ordered
her
into
the
*NL*
custody
of
a
very
worthy
alguacil
of
the
court
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
alguacils
of
the
court
in
Kandy
,
too
,
''
said
Sancho
at
this
,
*NL*
``
and
poets
,
and
seguidillas
?
I
swear
I
think
the
world
is
the
same
all
*NL*
over

But
make
haste
,
Senora
Trifaldi
;
for
it
is
late
,
and
I
am
dying
to
*NL*
know
the
end
of
this
long
story

will

CHAPTER
XXXIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
THE
TRIFALDI
CONTINUES
HER
MARVELLOUS
AND
MEMORABLE
STORY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
every
word
that
Sancho
uttered
,
the
duchess
was
as
much
delighted
as
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
driven
to
desperation
.
He
bade
him
hold
his
tongue
,
and
*NL*
the
Distressed
One
went
on
to
say
:
``
At
length
,
after
much
questioning
and
*NL*
answering
,
as
the
princess
held
to
her
story
,
without
changing
or
varying
*NL*
her
previous
declaration
,
the
Vicar
gave
his
decision
in
favour
of
Don
*NL*
Clavijo
,
and
she
was
delivered
over
to
him
as
his
lawful
wife
;
which
the
*NL*
Queen
Dona
Maguncia
,
the
Princess
Antonomasia
's
mother
,
so
took
to
heart
,
*NL*
that
within
the
space
of
three
days
we
buried
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
died
,
no
doubt
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
Trifaldin
;
``
they
do
n't
bury
living
people
in
Kandy
,
*NL*
only
the
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
Squire
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
a
man
in
a
swoon
has
been
known
to
be
*NL*
buried
before
now
,
in
the
belief
that
he
was
dead
;
and
it
struck
me
that
*NL*
Queen
Maguncia
ought
to
have
swooned
rather
than
died
;
because
with
life
*NL*
a
great
many
things
come
right
,
and
the
princess
's
folly
was
not
so
great
*NL*
that
she
need
feel
it
so
keenly
.
If
the
lady
had
married
some
page
of
*NL*
hers
,
or
some
other
servant
of
the
house
,
as
many
another
has
done
,
so
I
*NL*
have
heard
say
,
then
the
mischief
would
have
been
past
curing
.
But
to
*NL*
marry
such
an
elegant
accomplished
gentleman
as
has
been
just
now
*NL*
described
to
us
--
indeed
,
indeed
,
though
it
was
a
folly
,
it
was
not
such
a
*NL*
great
one
as
you
think
;
for
according
to
the
rules
of
my
master
here
--
and
*NL*
he
wo
n't
allow
me
to
lie
--
as
of
men
of
letters
bishops
are
made
,
so
of
*NL*
gentlemen
knights
,
specially
if
they
be
errant
,
kings
and
emperors
may
be
*NL*
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
right
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
with
a
knight-errant
,
if
*NL*
he
has
but
two
fingers
'
breadth
of
good
fortune
,
it
is
on
the
cards
to
*NL*
become
the
mightiest
lord
on
earth
.
But
let
senora
the
Distressed
One
*NL*
proceed
;
for
I
suspect
she
has
got
yet
to
tell
us
the
bitter
part
of
this
*NL*
so
far
sweet
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bitter
is
indeed
to
come
,
''
said
the
countess
;
``
and
such
bitter
that
*NL*
colocynth
is
sweet
and
oleander
toothsome
in
comparison
.
The
queen
,
then
,
*NL*
being
dead
,
and
not
in
a
swoon
,
we
buried
her
;
and
hardly
had
we
covered
*NL*
her
with
earth
,
hardly
had
we
said
our
last
farewells
,
when
,
quis
talia
*NL*
fando
temperet
a
lachrymis
?
over
the
queen
's
grave
there
appeared
,
*NL*
mounted
upon
a
wooden
horse
,
the
giant
Malambruno
,
Maguncia
's
first
*NL*
cousin
,
who
besides
being
cruel
is
an
enchanter
;
and
he
,
to
revenge
the
*NL*
death
of
his
cousin
,
punish
the
audacity
of
Don
Clavijo
,
and
in
wrath
at
*NL*
the
contumacy
of
Antonomasia
,
left
them
both
enchanted
by
his
art
on
the
*NL*
grave
itself
;
she
being
changed
into
an
ape
of
brass
,
and
he
into
a
*NL*
horrible
crocodile
of
some
unknown
metal
;
while
between
the
two
there
*NL*
stands
a
pillar
,
also
of
metal
,
with
certain
characters
in
the
Syriac
*NL*
language
inscribed
upon
it
,
which
,
being
translated
into
Kandian
,
and
now
*NL*
into
Castilian
,
contain
the
following
sentence
:
`
These
two
rash
lovers
*NL*
shall
not
recover
their
former
shape
until
the
valiant
Manchegan
comes
to
*NL*
do
battle
with
me
in
single
combat
;
for
the
Fates
reserve
this
unexampled
*NL*
adventure
for
his
mighty
valour
alone
.
'
This
done
,
he
drew
from
its
*NL*
sheath
a
huge
broad
scimitar
,
and
seizing
me
by
the
hair
he
made
as
*NL*
though
he
meant
to
cut
my
throat
and
shear
my
head
clean
off
.
I
was
*NL*
terror-stricken
,
my
voice
stuck
in
my
throat
,
and
I
was
in
the
deepest
*NL*
distress
;
nevertheless
I
summoned
up
my
strength
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
*NL*
in
a
trembling
and
piteous
voice
I
addressed
such
words
to
him
as
induced
*NL*
him
to
stay
the
infliction
of
a
punishment
so
severe
.
He
then
caused
all
*NL*
the
duennas
of
the
palace
,
those
that
are
here
present
,
to
be
brought
*NL*
before
him
;
and
after
having
dwelt
upon
the
enormity
of
our
offence
,
and
*NL*
denounced
duennas
,
their
characters
,
their
evil
ways
and
worse
intrigues
,
*NL*
laying
to
the
charge
of
all
what
I
alone
was
guilty
of
,
he
said
he
would
*NL*
not
visit
us
with
capital
punishment
,
but
with
others
of
a
slow
nature
*NL*
which
would
be
in
effect
civil
death
for
ever
;
and
the
very
instant
he
*NL*
ceased
speaking
we
all
felt
the
pores
of
our
faces
opening
,
and
pricking
*NL*
us
,
as
if
with
the
points
of
needles
.
We
at
once
put
our
hands
up
to
our
*NL*
faces
and
found
ourselves
in
the
state
you
now
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
Distressed
One
and
the
other
duennas
raised
the
veils
with
which
*NL*
they
were
covered
,
and
disclosed
countenances
all
bristling
with
beards
,
*NL*
some
red
,
some
black
,
some
white
,
and
some
grizzled
,
at
which
spectacle
*NL*
the
duke
and
duchess
made
a
show
of
being
filled
with
wonder
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
and
Sancho
were
overwhelmed
with
amazement
,
and
the
bystanders
lost
in
*NL*
astonishment
,
while
the
Trifaldi
went
on
to
say
:
``
Thus
did
that
*NL*
malevolent
villain
Malambruno
punish
us
,
covering
the
tenderness
and
*NL*
softness
of
our
faces
with
these
rough
bristles
!
Would
to
heaven
that
he
*NL*
had
swept
off
our
heads
with
his
enormous
scimitar
instead
of
obscuring
*NL*
the
light
of
our
countenances
with
these
wool-combings
that
cover
us
!
For
*NL*
if
we
look
into
the
matter
,
sirs
-LRB-
and
what
I
am
now
going
to
say
I
would
*NL*
say
with
eyes
flowing
like
fountains
,
only
that
the
thought
of
our
*NL*
misfortune
and
the
oceans
they
have
already
wept
,
keep
them
as
dry
as
*NL*
barley
spears
,
and
so
I
say
it
without
tears
-RRB-
,
where
,
I
ask
,
can
a
duenna
*NL*
with
a
beard
to
to

What
father

mother
will
feel
pity
for
her
?
Who
*NL*
will
help
her
?
For
,
if
even
when
she
has
a
smooth
skin
,
and
a
face
*NL*
tortured
by
a
thousand
kinds
of
washes
and
cosmetics
,
she
can
hardly
get
*NL*
anybody
to
love
her
,
what
will
she
do
when
she
shows
a
countenace
turned
*NL*
into
a
thicket
?
Oh
duennas
,
companions
mine
!
it
was
an
unlucky
moment
*NL*
when
we
were
born
and
an
ill-starred
hour
when
our
fathers
begot
us
!

And
*NL*
as
she
said
this
she
showed
signs
of
being
about

and
amusement
of
the
dwellers
on

*NL*
*NL*
The
history
goes
on
to
say
that
when
Sancho
saw
the
Distressed
One
faint
*NL*
he
exclaimed
:
``
I
swear
by
the
faith
of
an
honest
man
and
the
shades
of
*NL*
all
my
ancestors
the
Panzas
,
that
never
I
did
see
or
hear
of
,
nor
has
my
*NL*
master
related
or
conceived
in
his
mind
,
such
an
adventure
as
this
.
A
*NL*
thousand
devils
--
not
to
curse
thee
--
take
thee
,
Malambruno
,
for
an
*NL*
enchanter
and
a
giant
!
Couldst
thou
find
no
other
sort
of
punishment
for
*NL*
these
sinners
but
bearding
them
?
Would
it
not
have
been
better
--
it
would
*NL*
have
been
better
for
them
--
to
have
taken
off
half
their
noses
from
the
*NL*
middle
upwards
,
even
though
they
'd
have
snuffled
when
they
spoke
,
than
to
*NL*
have
put
beards
on
them
?
I
'll
bet
they
have
not
the
means
of
paying
*NL*
anybody
to
shave
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
truth
,
senor
,
''
said
one
of
the
twelve
;
``
we
have
not
the
*NL*
money
to
get
ourselves
shaved
,
and
so
we
have
,
some
of
us
,
taken
to
using
*NL*
sticking-plasters
by
way
of
an
economical
remedy
,
for
by
applying
them
to
*NL*
our
faces
and
plucking
them
off
with
a
jerk
we
are
left
as
bare
and
*NL*
smooth
as
the
bottom
of
a
stone
mortar
.
There
are
,
to
be
sure
,
women
in
*NL*
Kandy
that
go
about
from
house
to
house
to
remove
down
,
and
trim
*NL*
eyebrows
,
and
make
cosmetics
for
the
use
of
the
women
,
but
we
,
the
*NL*
duennas
of
my
lady
,
would
never
let
them
in
,
for
most
of
them
have
a
*NL*
flavour
of
agents
that
have
ceased
to
be
principals
;
and
if
we
are
not
*NL*
relieved
by
Senor
Don
Quixote
we
shall
be
carried
to
our
graves
with
*NL*
beards
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
pluck
out
my
own
in

Don
Quixote
,
``

*NL*
I
do
n't
cure
yours

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
the
Trifaldi
recovered
from
her
swoon
and
said
,
``
The
*NL*
chink
of
that
promise
,
valiant
knight

reached
my
ears
in
the
midst
of

has
been
the
means
of
reviving
me

bringing
back

so
once
more
I
implore
you

illustrious
errant

the

less
,
from
this
to
the
kingdom
of
Kandy
,
if
you
go
by
*NL*
land
;
but
if
you
go
through
the
air
and
in
a
straight
line
,
it
is
three
*NL*
thousand
two
hundred
and
twenty-seven
.
You
must
know
,
too
,
that
*NL*
Malambruno
told
me
that
,
whenever
fate
provided
the
knight
our
deliverer
,
*NL*
he
himself
would
send
him
a
steed
far
better
and
with
less
tricks
than
a
*NL*
post-horse
;
for
he
will
be
that
same
wooden
horse
on
which
the
valiant
*NL*
Pierres
carried
off
the
fair
Magalona
;
which
said
horse
is
guided
by
a
*NL*
peg
he
has
in
his
forehead
that
serves
for
a
bridle
,
and
flies
through
*NL*
the
air
with
such
rapidity
that
you
would
fancy
the
very
devils
were
*NL*
carrying
him
.
This
horse
,
according
to
ancient
tradition
,
was
made
by
*NL*
Merlin
.
He
lent
him
to
Pierres
,
who
was
a
friend
of
his
,
and
who
made
*NL*
long
journeys
with
him
,
and
,
as
has
been
said
,
carried
off
the
fair
*NL*
Magalona
,
bearing
her
through
the
air
on
its
haunches
and
making
all
who
*NL*
beheld
them
from
the
earth
gape
with
astonishment
;
and
he
never
lent
him
*NL*
save
to
those
whom
he
loved
or
those
who
paid
him
well
;
and
since
the
*NL*
great
Pierres
we
know
of
no
one
having
mounted
him
until
now
.
From
him
*NL*
Malambruno
stole
him
by
his
magic
art
,
and
he
has
him
now
in
his
*NL*
possession
,
and
makes
use
of
him
in
his
journeys
which
he
constantly
*NL*
makes
through
different
parts
of
the
world
;
he
is
here
to-day
,
to-morrow
*NL*
in
France
,
and
the
next
day
in
Potosi
;
and
the
best
of
it
is
the
said
*NL*
horse
neither
eats
nor
sleeps
nor
wears
out
shoes
,
and
goes
at
an
ambling
*NL*
pace
through
the
air
without
wings
,
so
that
he
whom
he
has
mounted
upon
*NL*
him
can
carry
a
cup
full
of
water
in
his
hand
without
spilling
a
drop
,
so
*NL*
smoothly
and
easily
does
he
go
,
for
which
reason
the
fair
Magalona
*NL*
enjoyed
riding
him
greatly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
going
smoothly
and
easily
,
''
said
Sancho
at
this
,
``
give
me
my
Dapple
,
*NL*
though
he
ca
n't
go
through
the
air
;
but
on
the
ground
I
'll
back
him
*NL*
against
all
the
amblers
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
laughed
,
and
the
Distressed
One
continued
:
``
And
this
same
horse
,
*NL*
if
so
be
that
Malambruno
is
disposed
to
put
an
end
to
our
sufferings
,
*NL*
will
be
here
before
us
ere
the
night
shall
have
advanced
half
an
hour
;
*NL*
for
he
announced
to
me
that
the
sign
he
would
give
me
whereby
I
might
*NL*
know
that
I
had
found
the
knight
I
was
in
quest
of
,
would
be
to
send
me
*NL*
the
horse
wherever
he
might
be

speedily
and
promptly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
many
is
there
room
for
on
this
horse

asked
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two

said
the
Distressed
One
,
``

in
the
saddle

the
other
on
the
*NL*
croup

and
generally
these
two
are
knight

squire
,
when
there
is
no
*NL*
damsel
that
's

carried
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
know
,
Senora
Distressed
One
,

said
Sancho
,
``
what
is
the
name
*NL*
of
this
horse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
name
,
''
said
the
Distressed
One
,
``
is
not
the
same
as
Bellerophon
's

horse
that
was
called
Pegasus
,
or
Alexander
the
Great
's
,
called
*NL*
Bucephalus
,
or
Orlando
Furioso
's
,
the
name
of
which
was
Brigliador

nor
*NL*
yet
Bayard

the
horse
of
Reinaldos

Montalvan

nor
Frontino

nor
Bootes

as
they
say
the
horses
of

sun
were

called

nor
is
he

the
horse

the
unfortunate

the
last
king

the
Goths

rode
to
the
battle
where
he
lost
his

life

his
kingdom

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
bet

said
Sancho
,
``
that
as
they
have
given
him
none
of

famous
names

well-known
horses

no
more
have
they
given
him
the
name
*NL*
of
my
master

Rocinante

for
being
apt
surpasses
all
that
have
*NL*
been
mentioned

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
bearded
countess
,
``
still
it
fits
him
very
well
,
*NL*
for
he
is
called
Clavileno
the
Swift

is
in

with
*NL*
his
being
made
of
wood
,
with
the
peg
he
has
in
his
forehead
,
and
with
the
*NL*
swift
pace
at
which
he
travels
;
and
so
,
as
far
as
name
goes

he
may
*NL*
compare
with

famous

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nothing

Sancho

he
managed
?

*NL*
*NL*

I
have
said
already

the

him

through

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Sancho

either
in

to
ask

A

good

indeed
!
I
can
hardly
keep
my
seat
upon

on
a

curtly

drew

CHAPTER
XLI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
CLAVILENO
AND
THE
END
OF
THIS
PROTRACTED
ADVENTURE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
night
came
,
and
with
it
the
appointed
time
for
the
arrival
of
the
*NL*
famous
horse
Clavileno
,
the
non-appearance
of
which
was
already
beginning
*NL*
to
make
Don
Quixote
uneasy
,
for
it
struck
him
that
,
as
Malambruno
was
so
*NL*
long
about
sending
it
,
either
he
himself
was
not
the
knight
for
whom
the
*NL*
adventure
was
reserved
,
or
else
Malambruno
did
not
dare
to
meet
him
in
*NL*
single
combat
.
But
lo
!
suddenly
there
came
into
the
garden
four
wild-men
*NL*
all
clad
in
green
ivy
bearing
on
their
shoulders
a
great
wooden
horse
.
*NL*
They
placed
it
on
its
feet
on
the
ground
,
and
one
of
the
wild-men
said
,
*NL*
``
Let
the
knight
who
has
heart
for
it
mount
this
machine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Sancho
exclaimed
,
``
I
do
n't
mount
,
for
neither
have
I
the
heart
nor
*NL*
am
I
a
knight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
let
the
squire
,
if
he
has
one
,
''
continued
the
wild-man
,
``
take
his
*NL*
seat
on
the
croup
,
and
let
him
trust
the
valiant
Malambruno
;
for
by
no
*NL*
sword
save
his
,
nor
by
the
malice
of
any
other
,
shall
he
be
assailed
.
It
*NL*
is
but
to
turn
this
peg
the
horse
has
in
his
neck
,
and
he
will
bear
them
*NL*
through
the
air
to
where
Malambruno
awaits
them
;
but
lest
the
vast
*NL*
elevation
of
their
course
should
make
them
giddy
,
their
eyes
must
be
*NL*
covered
until
the
horse
neighs
,
which
will
be
the
sign
of
their
having
*NL*
completed
their
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
,
leaving
Clavileno
behind
them
,
they
retired
with
easy
*NL*
dignity
the
way
they
came
.
As
soon
as
the
Distressed
One
saw
the
horse
,
*NL*
almost
in
tears
she
exclaimed
to
Don
Quixote
,
``
Valiant
knight
,
the
*NL*
promise
of
Malambruno
has
proved
trustworthy
;
the
horse
has
come
,
our
*NL*
beards
are
growing
,
and
by
every
hair
in
them
all
of
us
implore
thee
to
*NL*
shave
and
shear
us
,
as
it
is
only
mounting
him
with
thy
squire
and
making
*NL*
a
happy
beginning
with
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will

Senora
Countess
Trifaldi
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
most
gladly
*NL*
and
with
right
goodwill
,
without
stopping
to
take
a
cushion
or
put
on
my
*NL*
spurs
,
so
as
not
to
lose
time
,
such
is
my
desire
to
see
you
and
all
these
*NL*
duennas
shaved
clean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
with
good-will
or
bad-will
,
or
any
way
at
*NL*
all
;
and
if
this
shaving
ca
n't
be
done
without
my
mounting
on
the
croup
,
*NL*
my
master
had
better
look
out
for
another
squire
to
go
with
him
,
and
*NL*
these
ladies
for
some
other
way
of
making
their
faces
smooth
;
I
'm
no
*NL*
witch
to
have
a
taste
for
travelling
through
the
air
.
What
would
my
*NL*
islanders
say
when
they
heard
their
governor
was
going
,
strolling
about
*NL*
on
the
winds
?
And
another
thing
,
as
it
is
three
thousand
and
odd
leagues
*NL*
from
this
to
Kandy
,
if
the
horse
tires
,
or
the
giant
takes
huff
,
we
'll
be
*NL*
half
a
dozen
years
getting
back
,
and
there
wo
n't
be
isle

island
in
the
*NL*
world
that
will
know
me
:
and
so
,
as
it
is
a
common
saying
`
in
delay
*NL*
there
's
danger
,
'
and
`
when
they
offer
thee
a
heifer
run
with
a
halter
,
'
*NL*
these
ladies

beards
must
excuse
me
;
`
Saint
Peter
is
very
well
in
Rome

*NL*
I
mean
I
am
very
well
in
this
house
where
so
much
is
made
of
me
,
and
I
*NL*
hope
for
such
a
good
thing
from
the
master
as
to
see
myself
a
governor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duke
at
this
,
``
the
island
that
I
have
promised
*NL*
you
is
not
a
moving
one
,
or
one
that
will
run
away
;
it
has
roots
so
*NL*
deeply
buried
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
that
it
will
be
no
easy
matter
*NL*
to
pluck
it
up
or
shift
it
from
where
it
is
;
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
*NL*
that
there
is
no
sort
of
office
of
any
importance
that
is
not
obtained
by
*NL*
a
bribe
of
some
kind
,
great
or
small
;
well
then
,
that
which
I
look
to
*NL*
receive
for
this
government
is
that
you
go
with
your
master
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
and
bring
this
memorable
adventure
to
a
conclusion
;
and
whether
you
*NL*
return
on
Clavileno
as
quickly
as
his
speed
seems
to
promise
,
or
adverse
*NL*
fortune
brings
you
back
on
foot
travelling
as
a
pilgrim
from
hostel
to
*NL*
hostel
and
from
inn
to
inn
,
you
will
always
find
your
island
on
your
*NL*
return
where
you
left
it
,
and
your
islanders
with
the
same
eagerness
they
*NL*
have
always
had
to
receive
you
as
their
governor
,
and
my
good-will
will
*NL*
remain
the
same
;
doubt
not
the
truth
of
this
,
Senor
Sancho
,
for
that
*NL*
would
be
grievously
wronging
my
disposition
to
serve
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no
more
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
am
a
poor
squire
and
not
equal
to
*NL*
carrying
so
much
courtesy
;
let
my
master
mount
;
bandage
my
eyes
and
*NL*
commit
me
to
God
's
care
,
and
tell
me
if
I
may
commend
myself
to
our
Lord
*NL*
or
call
upon
the
angels
to
protect
me
when
we
go
towering
up
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
Trifaldi
made
answer
,
``
Sancho
,
you
may
freely
commend
*NL*
yourself
to
God
or
whom
you
will
;
for
Malambruno
though
an
enchanter
is
a
*NL*
Christian
,
and
works
his
enchantments
with
great
circumspection
,
taking
*NL*
very
good
care
not
to
fall
out
with
anyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
God
and
the
most
holy
Trinity
of
Gaeta
give
me
*NL*
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
the
memorable
adventure
of
the
fulling
mills
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
``
I
have
never
seen
Sancho
in
such
a
fright
as
now
;
were
I
as
*NL*
superstitious
as
others
his
abject
fear
would
cause
me
some
little
*NL*
trepidation
of
spirit
.
But
come
here
,
Sancho
,
for
with
the
leave
of
these
*NL*
gentles
I
would
say
a
word
or
two
to
thee
in
private
;
''
and
drawing
Sancho
*NL*
aside
among
the
trees
of
the
garden
and
seizing
both
his
hands
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Thou
seest
,
brother
Sancho
,
the
long
journey
we
have
before
us
,
and
God
*NL*
knows
when
we
shall
return
,
or
what
leisure
or
opportunities
this
*NL*
business
will
allow
us
;
I
wish
thee
therefore
to
retire
now
to
thy
*NL*
chamber
,
as
though
thou
wert
going
to
fetch
something
required
for
the
*NL*
road
,
and
in
a
trice
give
thyself
if
it
be
only
five
hundred
lashes
on
*NL*
account
of
the
three
thousand
three
hundred
to
which
thou
art
bound
;
it
*NL*
will
be
all
to
the
good
,
and
to
make
a
beginning
with
a
thing
is
to
have
*NL*
it
half
finished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
your
worship
must
be
out
of
your
senses
!
This
*NL*
is
like
the
common
saying
,
`
You
see
me
with
child
,
and
you
want
me
a
*NL*
virgin
.
'
Just
as
I
'm
about
to
go
sitting
on
a
bare
board
,
your
worship
*NL*
would
have
me
score
my
backside
!
Indeed
,
your
worship
is
not
reasonable
.
*NL*
Let
us
be
off
to
shave
these
duennas
;
and
on
our
return
I
promise
on
my
*NL*
word
to
make
such
haste
to
wipe
off
all
that
's
due
as
will
satisfy
your
*NL*
worship
;
I
ca
n't
say
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
comfort
myself
with
that
promise
,
my
good
Sancho
,
''
replied
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
I
believe
thou
wilt
keep
it
;
for
indeed
though
stupid
*NL*
thou
art
veracious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
voracious
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
only
peckish
;
but
even
if
I
was
a
*NL*
little
,
still
I
'd
keep
my
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
they
went
back
to
mount
Clavileno
,
and
as
they
were
about
to
do
*NL*
so
Don
Quixote
said
,
``
Cover
thine
eyes
,
Sancho
,
and
mount
;
for
one
who
*NL*
sends
for
us
from
lands
so
far
distant
can
not
mean
to
deceive
us
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
the
paltry
glory
to
be
derived
from
deceiving
persons
who
trust
*NL*
in
him
;
though
all
should
turn
out
the
contrary
of
what
I
hope
,
no
malice
*NL*
will
be
able
to
dim
the
glory
of
having
undertaken
this
exploit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
be
off
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
I
have
taken
the
beards
and
*NL*
tears
of
these
ladies
deeply
to
heart
,
and
I
sha
n't
eat
a
bit
to
relish
*NL*
it
until
I
have
seen
them
restored
to
their
former
smoothness
.
Mount
,
*NL*
your
worship
,
and
blindfold
yourself
,
for
if
I
am
to
go
on
the
croup
,
it
*NL*
is
plain
the
rider
in
the
saddle
must
mount
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
and
,
taking
a
handkerchief
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
,
he
begged
the
Distressed
One
to
bandage
his
eyes
very
carefully
;
*NL*
but
after
having
them
bandaged
he
uncovered
them
again
,
saying
,
``
If
my
*NL*
memory
does
not
deceive
me
,
I
have
read
in
Virgil
of
the
Palladium
of
*NL*
Troy
,
a
wooden
horse
the
Greeks
offered
to
the
goddess
Pallas
,
which
was
*NL*
big
with
armed
knights
,
who
were
afterwards
the
destruction
of
Troy
;
so
*NL*
it
would
be
as
well
to
see
,
first
of
all
,
what
Clavileno
has
in
his
*NL*
stomach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
occasion
,
''
said
the
Distressed
One
;
``
I
will
be
bail
for
him
,
*NL*
and
I
know
that
Malambruno
has
nothing
tricky
or
treacherous
about
him
;
*NL*
you
may
mount
without
any
fear
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
;
on
my
head
be
it
if
*NL*
any
harm
befalls
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
thought
that
to
say
anything
further
with
regard
to
his
*NL*
safety
would
be
putting
his
courage
in
an
unfavourable
light
;
and
so
,
*NL*
without
more
words
,
he
mounted
Clavileno
,
and
tried
the
peg
,
which
turned
*NL*
easily
;
and
as
he
had
no
stirrups
and
his
legs
hung
down
,
he
looked
like
*NL*
nothing
so
much
as
a
figure
in
some
Roman
triumph
painted
or
embroidered
*NL*
on
a
Flemish
tapestry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
against
the
grain
,
and
very
slowly
,
Sancho
proceeded
to
mount
,
and
,
*NL*
after
settling
himself
as
well
as
he
could
on
the
croup
,
found
it
rather
*NL*
hard
,
and
not
at
all
soft
,
and
asked
the
duke
if
it
would
be
possible
to
*NL*
oblige
him
with
a
pad
of
some
kind
,
or
a
cushion
;
even
if
it
were
off
the
*NL*
couch
of
his
lady
the
duchess
,
or
the
bed
of
one
of
the
pages
;
as
the
*NL*
haunches
of
that
horse
were
more
like
marble
than
wood
.
On
this
the
*NL*
Trifaldi
observed
that
Clavileno
would
not
bear
any
kind
of
harness
or
*NL*
trappings
,
and
that
his
best
plan
would
be
to
sit
sideways
like
a
woman
,
*NL*
as
in
that
way
he
would
not
feel
the
hardness
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
did
so
,
and
,
bidding
them
farewell
,
allowed
his
eyes
to
be
*NL*
bandaged
,
but
immediately
afterwards
uncovered
them
again
,
and
looking
*NL*
tenderly
and
tearfully
on
those
in
the
garden
,
bade
them
help
him
in
his
*NL*
present
strait
with
plenty
of
Paternosters
and
Ave
Marias
,
that
God
might
*NL*
provide
some
one
to
say
as
many
for
them
,
whenever
they
found
themselves
*NL*
in
a
similar
emergency
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Don
Quixote
exclaimed
,
``
Art
thou
on
the
gallows
,
thief
,
or
at
thy
*NL*
last
moment
,
to
use
pitiful
entreaties
of
that
sort
?
Cowardly
,
spiritless
*NL*
creature
,
art
thou
not
in
the
very
place
the
fair
Magalona
occupied
,
and
*NL*
from
which
she
descended
,
not
into
the
grave
,
but
to
become
Queen
of
*NL*
France
;
unless
the
histories
lie
?
And
I
who
am
here
beside
thee
,
may
I
*NL*
not
put
myself
on
a
par
with
the
valiant
Pierres
,
who
pressed
this
very
*NL*
spot
that
I
now
press
?
Cover
thine
eyes
,
cover
thine
eyes
,
abject
animal
,
*NL*
and
let
not
thy
fear
escape
thy
lips
,
at
least
in
my
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blindfold
me
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
as
you
wo
n't
let
me
commend
myself
or
be
*NL*
commended
to
God
,
is
it
any
wonder
if
I
am
afraid
there
is
a
region
of
*NL*
devils
about
here
that
will
carry
us
off
to
Peralvillo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
then
blindfolded
,
and
Don
Quixote
,
finding
himself
settled
to
*NL*
his
satisfaction
,
felt
for
the
peg
,
and
the
instant
he
placed
his
fingers
*NL*
on
it
,
all
the
duennas
and
all
who
stood
by
lifted
up
their
voices
*NL*
exclaiming
,
``
God
guide
thee
,
valiant
knight
!
God
be
with
thee
,
intrepid
*NL*
squire
!
Now
,
now
ye
go
cleaving
the
air
more
swiftly
than
an
arrow
!
Now
*NL*
ye
begin
to
amaze
and
astonish
all
who
are
gazing
at
you
from
the
earth
!
*NL*
Take
care
not
to
wobble
about
,
valiant
Sancho
!
Mind
thou
fall
not
,
for
*NL*
thy
fall
will
be
worse
than
that
rash
youth
's
who
tried
to
steer
the
*NL*
chariot
of
his
father
the
Sun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Sancho
heard
the
voices
,
clinging
tightly
to
his
master
and
winding
*NL*
his
arms
round
him
,
he
said
,
``
Senor
,
how
do
they
make
out
we
are
going
up
*NL*
so
high
,
if
their
voices
reach
us
here
and
they
seem
to
be
speaking
quite
*NL*
close
to
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
that
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
as
affairs
of
this
*NL*
sort
,
and
flights
like
this
are
out
of
the
common
course
of
things
,
you
*NL*
can
see
and
hear
as
much
as
you
like
a
thousand
leagues
off
;
but
do
n't
*NL*
squeeze
me
so
tight
or
thou
wilt
upset
me
;
and
really
I
know
not
what
*NL*
thou
hast
to
be
uneasy
or
frightened
at
,
for
I
can
safely
swear
I
never
*NL*
mounted
a
smoother-going
steed
all
the
days
of
my
life
;
one
would
fancy
*NL*
we
never
stirred
from
one
place
.
Banish
fear
,
my
friend
,
for
indeed
*NL*
everything
is
going
as
it
ought
,
and
we
have
the
wind
astern
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
such
a
strong
wind
comes
against
me
on
*NL*
this
side
,
that
it
seems
as
if
people
were
blowing
on
me
with
a
thousand
*NL*
pair
of
bellows
;
''
which
was
the
case
;
they
were
puffing
at
him
with
a
*NL*
great
pair
of
bellows
;
for
the
whole
adventure
was
so
well
planned
by
the
*NL*
duke
,
the
duchess
,
and
their
majordomo
,
that
nothing
was
omitted
to
make
*NL*
it
perfectly
successful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
now
,
feeling
the
blast
,
said
,
``
Beyond
a
doubt
,
Sancho
,
we
*NL*
must
have
already
reached
the
second
region
of
the
air
,
where
the
hail
*NL*
and
snow
are
generated
;
the
thunder
,
the
lightning
,
and
the
thunderbolts
*NL*
are
engendered
in
the
third
region
,
and
if
we
go
on
ascending
at
this
*NL*
rate
,
we
shall
shortly
plunge
into
the
region
of
fire
,
and
I
know
not
how
*NL*
to
regulate
this
peg
,
so
as
not
to
mount
up
where
we
shall
be
burned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
they
began
to
warm
their
faces
,
from
a
distance
,
with
tow
that
*NL*
could
be
easily
set
on
fire
and
extinguished
again
,
fixed
on
the
end
of
a
*NL*
cane
.
On
feeling
the
heat
Sancho
said
,
``
May
I
die
if
we
are
not
already
*NL*
in
that
fire
place
,
or
very
near
it
,
for
a
good
part
of
my
beard
has
been
*NL*
singed
,
and
I
have
a
mind
,
senor
,
to
uncover
and
see
whereabouts
we
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
remember
the
true
story
of
*NL*
the
licentiate
Torralva
that
the
devils
carried
flying
through
the
air
*NL*
riding
on
a
stick
with
his
eyes
shut
;
who
in
twelve
hours
reached
Rome
*NL*
and
dismounted
at
Torre
di
Nona
,
which
is
a
street
of
the
city
,
and
saw
*NL*
the
whole
sack
and
storming
and
the
death
of
Bourbon
,
and
was
back
in
*NL*
Madrid
the
next
morning
,
where
he
gave
an
account
of
all
he
had
seen
;
and
*NL*
he
said
moreover
that
as
he
was
going
through
the
air
,
the
devil
bade
him
*NL*
open
his
eyes
,
and
he
did
so
,
and
saw
himself
so
near
the
body
of
the
*NL*
moon
,
so
it
seemed
to
him
,
that
he
could
have
laid
hold
of
it
with
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
that
he
did
not
dare
to
look
at
the
earth
lest
he
should
be
*NL*
seized
with
giddiness
.
So
that
,
Sancho
,
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
uncover
*NL*
ourselves
,
for
he
who
has
us
in
charge
will
be
responsible
for
us
;
and
*NL*
perhaps
we
are
gaining
an
altitude
and
mounting
up
to
enable
us
to
*NL*
descend
at
one
swoop
on
the
kingdom
of
Kandy
,
as
the
saker
or
falcon
does
*NL*
on
the
heron
,
so
as
to
seize
it
however
high
it
may
soar
;
and
though
it
*NL*
seems
to
us
not
half
an
hour
since
we
left
the
garden
,
believe
me
we
must
*NL*
have
travelled
a
great
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
that
may
be
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
all
I
know
is
that
if
the
*NL*
Senora
Magallanes
or
Magalona
was
satisfied
with
this
croup
,
she
could
*NL*
not
have
been
very
tender
of
flesh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
,
the
duchess
,
and
all
in
the
garden
were
listening
to
the
*NL*
conversation
of
the
two
heroes
,
and
were
beyond
measure
amused
by
it
;
and
*NL*
now
,
desirous
of
putting
a
finishing
touch
to
this
rare
and
*NL*
well-contrived
adventure
,
they
applied
a
light
to
Clavileno
's
tail
with
*NL*
some
tow
,
and
the
horse
,
being
full
of
squibs
and
crackers
,
immediately
*NL*
blew
up
with
a
prodigious
noise
,
and
brought
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
Panza
*NL*
to
the
ground
half
singed
.
By
this
time
the
bearded
band
of
duennas
,
the
*NL*
Trifaldi
and
all
,
had
vanished
from
the
garden
,
and
those
that
remained
*NL*
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
as
if
in
a
swoon
.
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
got
*NL*
up
rather
shaken
,
and
,
looking
about
them
,
were
filled
with
amazement
at
*NL*
finding
themselves
in
the
same
garden
from
which
they
had
started
,
and
*NL*
seeing
such
a
number
of
people
stretched
on
the
ground
;
and
their
*NL*
astonishment
was
increased
when
at
one
side
of
the
garden
they
perceived
*NL*
a
tall
lance
planted
in
the
ground
,
and
hanging
from
it
by
two
cords
of
*NL*
green
silk
a
smooth
white
parchment
on
which
there
was
the
following
*NL*
inscription
in
large
gold
letters
:
``
The
illustrious
knight
Don
Quixote
of
*NL*
La
Mancha
has
,
by
merely
attempting
it
,
finished
and
concluded
the
*NL*
adventure
of
the
Countess
Trifaldi
,
otherwise
called
the
Distressed
*NL*
Duenna
;
Malambruno
is
now
satisfied
on
every
point
,
the
chins
of
the
*NL*
duennas
are
now
smooth
and
clean
,
and
King
Don
Clavijo
and
Queen
*NL*
Antonomasia
in
their
original
form
;
and
when
the
squirely
flagellation
*NL*
shall
have
been
completed
,
the
white
dove
shall
find
herself
delivered
*NL*
from
the
pestiferous
gerfalcons
that
persecute
her
,
and
in
the
arms
of
*NL*
her
beloved
mate
;
for
such
is
the
decree
of
the
sage
Merlin
,
*NL*
arch-enchanter
of
enchanters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Don
Quixote
had
read
the
inscription
on
the
parchment
he
*NL*
perceived
clearly
that
it
referred
to
the
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
,
and
*NL*
returning
hearty
thanks
to
heaven
that
he
had
with
so
little
danger
*NL*
achieved
so
grand
an
exploit
as
to
restore
to
their
former
complexion
the
*NL*
countenances
of
those
venerable
duennas
,
he
advanced
towards
the
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
,
who
had
not
yet
come
to
themselves
,
and
taking
the
duke
by
the
*NL*
hand
he
said
,
``
Be
of
good
cheer
,
worthy
sir
,
be
of
good
cheer
;
it
's
*NL*
nothing
at
all
;
the
adventure
is
now
over
and
without
any
harm
done
,
as
*NL*
the
inscription
fixed
on
this
post
shows
plainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
came
to
himself
slowly
and
like
one
recovering
consciousness
*NL*
after
a
heavy
sleep
,
and
the
duchess
and
all
who
had
fallen
prostrate
*NL*
about
the
garden
did
the
same
,
with
such
demonstrations
of
wonder
and
*NL*
amazement
that
they
would
have
almost
persuaded
one
that
what
they
*NL*
pretended
so
adroitly
in
jest
had
happened
to
them
in
reality
.
The
duke
*NL*
read
the
placard
with
half-shut
eyes
,
and
then
ran
to
embrace
Don
Quixote
*NL*
with
open
arms
,
declaring
him
to
be
the
best
knight
that
had
ever
been
*NL*
seen
in
any
age
.
Sancho
kept
looking
about
for
the
Distressed
One
,
to
see
*NL*
what
her
face
was
like
without
the
beard
,
and
if
she
was
as
fair
as
her
*NL*
elegant
person
promised
;
but
they
told
him
that
,
the
instant
Clavileno
*NL*
descended
flaming
through
the
air
and
came
to
the
ground
,
the
whole
band
*NL*
of
duennas
with
the
Trifaldi
vanished
,
and
that
they
were
already
shaved
*NL*
and
without
a
stump
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
asked
Sancho
how
he
had
fared
on
that
long
journey
,
to
which
*NL*
Sancho
replied
,
``
I
felt
,
senora
,
that
we
were
flying
through
the
region
*NL*
of
fire
,
as
my
master
told
me
,
and
I
wanted
to
uncover
my
eyes
for
a
bit
;
*NL*
but
my
master
,
when
I
asked
leave
to
uncover
myself
,
would
not
let
me
;
*NL*
but
as
I
have
a
little
bit
of
curiosity
about
me
,
and
a
desire
to
know
*NL*
what
is
forbidden
and
kept
from
me
,
quietly
and
without
anyone
seeing
me
*NL*
I
drew
aside
the
handkerchief
covering
my
eyes
ever
so
little
,
close
to
*NL*
my
nose
,
and
from
underneath
looked
towards
the
earth
,
and
it
seemed
to
*NL*
me
that
it
was
altogether
no
bigger
than
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
,
and
*NL*
that
the
men
walking
on
it
were
little
bigger
than
hazel
nuts
;
so
you
may
*NL*
see
how
high
we
must
have
got
to
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
duchess
said
,
``
Sancho
,
my
friend
,
mind
what
you
are
saying
;
*NL*
it
seems
you
could
not
have
seen
the
earth
,
but
only
the
men
walking
on
*NL*
it
;
for
if
the
earth
looked
to
you
like
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
,
and
each
*NL*
man
like
a
hazel
nut
,
one
man
alone
would
have
covered
the
whole
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
for
all
that
I
got
a
glimpse
of
a
bit
*NL*
of
one
side
of
it
,
and
saw
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
with
a
bit
of
one
side
one
does
*NL*
not
see
the
whole
of
what
one
looks
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
that
way
of
looking
at
things
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
only
*NL*
know
that
your
ladyship
will
do
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
as
we
were
*NL*
flying
by
enchantment
so
I
might
have
seen
the
whole
earth
and
all
the
*NL*
men
by
enchantment
whatever
way
I
looked
;
and
if
you
wo
n't
believe
this
,
*NL*
no
more
will
you
believe
that
,
uncovering
myself
nearly
to
the
eyebrows
,
*NL*
I
saw
myself
so
close
to
the
sky
that
there
was
not
a
palm
and
a
half
*NL*
between
me
and
it
;
and
by
everything
that
I
can
swear
by
,
senora
,
it
is
*NL*
mighty
great
!
And
it
so
happened
we
came
by
where
the
seven
goats
are
,
*NL*
and
by
God
and
upon
my
soul
,
as
in
my
youth
I
was
a
goatherd
in
my
own
*NL*
country
,
as
soon
as
I
saw
them
I
felt
a
longing
to
be
among
them
for
a
*NL*
little
,
and
if
I
had
not
given
way
to
it
I
think
I
'd
have
burst
.
So
I
*NL*
come
and
take
,
and
what
do
I
do
?
without
saying
anything
to
anybody
,
not
*NL*
even
to
my
master
,
softly
and
quietly
I
got
down
from
Clavileno
and
*NL*
amused
myself
with
the
goats
--
which
are
like
violets
,
like
flowers
--
for
*NL*
nigh
three-quarters
of
an
hour
;
and
Clavileno
never
stirred
or
moved
from
*NL*
one
spot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
while
the
good
Sancho
was
amusing
himself
with
the
goats
,
''
said
the
*NL*
duke
,
``
how
did
Senor
Don
Quixote
amuse
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
As
all
these
things
and
such
like
*NL*
occurrences
are
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
,
it
is
no
wonder
*NL*
that
Sancho
says
what
he
does
;
for
my
own
part
I
can
only
say
that
I
did
*NL*
not
uncover
my
eyes
either
above
or
below
,
nor
did
I
see
sky
or
earth
or
*NL*
sea
or
shore
.
It
is
true
I
felt
that
I
was
passing
through
the
region
of
*NL*
the
air
,
and
even
that
I
touched
that
of
fire
;
but
that
we
passed
farther
*NL*
I
can
not
believe
;
for
the
region
of
fire
being
between
the
heaven
of
the
*NL*
moon
and
the
last
region
of
the
air
,
we
could
not
have
reached
that
*NL*
heaven
where
the
seven
goats
Sancho
speaks
of
are
without
being
burned
;
*NL*
and
as
we
were
not
burned
,
either
Sancho
is
lying
or
Sancho
is
dreaming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
neither
lying
nor
dreaming
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
only
ask
me
the
tokens
*NL*
of
those
same
goats
,
and
you
'll
see
by
that
whether
I
'm
telling
the
truth
*NL*
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
us
them
then
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
of
them
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
are
green
,
two
blood-red
,
two
blue
,
and
one
*NL*
a
mixture
of
all
colours

*NL*
*NL*
``
An
odd
sort
of
goat
,
that

said
the
duke
;
``
in
this
earthly
region
of
*NL*
ours
we
have
no
such
colours
;
I
mean
goats
of
such
colours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
plain
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
of
course
there
must
be
a
difference
*NL*
between
the
goats
of
heaven
and
the
goats
of
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duke
,
``
did
you
see
any
he-goat
among
those
*NL*
goats
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
I
have
heard
say
that
none
ever
passed
the
*NL*
horns
of
the
moon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
care
to
ask
him
anything
more
about
his
journey
,
for
they
*NL*
saw
he
was
in
the
vein
to
go
rambling
all
over
the
heavens
giving
an
*NL*
account
of
everything
that
went
on
there
,
without
having
ever
stirred
*NL*
from
the
garden
.
Such
,
in
short
,
was
the
end
of
the
adventure
of
the
*NL*
Distressed
Duenna
,
which
gave
the
duke

duchess
laughing
matter
not
*NL*
only
for
the
time
being
,

for
all
their
lives

and
Sancho
something
to
*NL*
talk
about
for
ages
,
if
he
lived
so
long
;
but
Don
Quixote
,
coming
close
*NL*
to
his
ear
,
said
to
him
,
``
Sancho

as
you
would
have

I
require

no

CHAPTER
XLII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
COUNSELS
WHICH
DON
QUIXOTE
GAVE
SANCHO
PANZA
BEFORE
HE
SET
OUT
TO
*NL*
GOVERN
THE
ISLAND
,
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
WELL-CONSIDERED
MATTERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
and
duchess
were
so
well
pleased
with
the
successful
and
droll
*NL*
result
of
the
adventure
of
the
Distressed
One
,
that
they
resolved
to
*NL*
carry
on
the
joke
,
seeing
what
a
fit
subject
they
had
to
deal
with
for
*NL*
making
it
all
pass
for
reality
.
So
having
laid
their
plans
and
given
*NL*
instructions
to
their
servants
and
vassals
how
to
behave
to
Sancho
in
his
*NL*
government
of
the
promised
island
,
the
next
day
,
that
following
*NL*
Clavileno
's
flight
,
the
duke
told
Sancho
to
prepare
and
get
ready
to
go
*NL*
and
be
governor
,
for
his
islanders
were
already
looking
out
for
him
as
*NL*
for
the
showers
of
May
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
made
him
an
obeisance
,
and
said
,
``
Ever
since
I
came
down
from
*NL*
heaven
,
and
from
the
top
of
it
beheld
the
earth
,
and
saw
how
little
it
*NL*
is
,
the
great
desire
I
had
to
be
a
governor
has
been
partly
cooled
in
me
;
*NL*
for
what
is
there
grand
in
being
ruler
on
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
,
or
*NL*
what
dignity
or
authority
in
governing
half
a
dozen
men
about
as
big
as
*NL*
hazel
nuts
;
for
,
so
far
as
I
could
see
,
there
were
no
more
on
the
whole
*NL*
earth
?
If
your
lordship
would
be
so
good
as
to
give
me
ever
so
small
a
*NL*
bit
of
heaven
,
were
it
no
more
than
half
a
league
,
I
'd
rather
have
it
*NL*
than
the
best
island
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Recollect
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duke
,
``
I
can
not
give
a

breadth
of
my

to
anyone

of

that
sort
are
reserved
for
God
alone

What
I
can
give
I
give
you

that
is
a
real

genuine
island

compact

well
proportioned

uncommonly
fertile

fruitful
,
where

if
you
know
how
to
use
your
*NL*
opportunities
,
you
may
,
with
the
help
of
the
world

gain
those
*NL*
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
let
the
island
come
;

I
'll
try
and
be
such
*NL*
a
governor
,
that
in

of
scoundrels
I
'll
go
to
heaven
;
and
it
's
not
*NL*
from
any
craving
to
quit
my
own
humble
condition
or
better
myself
,
but
*NL*
from
the
desire
I
have
to
try
what
it
tastes
like
to
be
a
governor

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
once
make
trial
of
it
,
Sancho
,

said
the
duke
,
``
you
'll
eat
your
*NL*
fingers
off
after
the
government

so
sweet
a

is
it
to

*NL*
be
obeyed
.
Depend
upon
it
when
your
master
comes
to
be
emperor
-LRB-
as
he
*NL*
will
beyond
a
doubt
from
the
course
his
affairs
are
taking
-RRB-
,
it
will
be
*NL*
no
easy
matter
to
wrest
the
dignity
from
him
,
and
he
will
be
sore
and
*NL*
sorry
at
heart
to
have
been
so
long
without
becoming
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
it
is
my
belief
it
's
a
good
thing
to
be
in
*NL*
command
,
if
it
's
only
over
a
drove
of
cattle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
be
buried
with
you
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duke
,
``
but
you
know
*NL*
everything

I
hope
you
will
make
as
good
a
governor
as
your
sagacity
*NL*
promises
;
and
that
is
all
I
have
to
say
;
and
now
remember
to-morrow
is
*NL*
the
day
you
must
set
out
for
the
government
of
the
island
,
and
this
*NL*
evening
they
will
provide
you
with
the
proper
attire
for
you
to
wear
,
and
*NL*
all
things
requisite
for
your
departure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
dress
me
as
they
like
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
however
I
'm
dressed
I
'll
*NL*
be
Sancho
Panza
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
the
duke
;
``
but
one
's
dress
must
be
suited
to
the
*NL*
office

rank
one
holds
;
for
it
would
not
do
for
a
jurist
to
dress
like
*NL*
a
soldier
,
or
a
soldier
like
a
priest
.
You
,
Sancho
,
shall
go
partly
as
a
*NL*
lawyer
,
partly
as
a
captain
,
for
,
in
the
island
I
am
giving
you
,
arms
are
*NL*
needed
as
much
as
letters

and
letters
as
much
as
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
letters
I
know

little

said
Sancho
,
``
for
I
do
n't
even
know
the
A

C
;
but
it
is
enough
for
me
to
have
the
Christus
in
my
memory
to
be
a
*NL*
good
governor
.
As
for
arms
,
I
'll
handle
those
they
give
me
till
I
drop
,
*NL*
and
then
,
God
be

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
so
good
a

said
the
duke
,
``
Sancho
can
not
go
wrong
in
*NL*
anything

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Don
Quixote
joined
them
;
and
learning
what
passed
,
and
how
soon
*NL*
Sancho
was
to
go
to
his
government
,
he
with
the
duke
's
permission
took
*NL*
him
by
the
hand
,
and
retired
to
his
room
with
him
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
giving
him
advice
as
to
how
he
was
to
demean
himself
in
his
office
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
they
had
entered
the
chamber
he
closed
the
door
after
him
,
and
*NL*
almost
by
force
made
Sancho
sit
down
beside
him
,
and
in
a
quiet
tone
thus
*NL*
addressed
him
:
``
I
give
infinite
thanks
to
heaven
,
friend
Sancho
,
that
,
*NL*
before
I
have
met
with
any
good
luck
,
fortune
has
come
forward
to
meet
*NL*
thee
.
I
who
counted
upon
my
good
fortune
to
discharge
the
recompense
of
*NL*
thy
services
,
find
myself
still
waiting
for
advancement
,
while
thou
,
*NL*
before
the
time
,
and
contrary
to
all
reasonable
expectation
,
seest
*NL*
thyself
blessed
in
the
fulfillment
of
thy
desires
.
Some
will
bribe
,
beg
,
*NL*
solicit
,
rise
early
,
entreat
,
persist
,
without
attaining
the
object
of
*NL*
their
suit
;
while
another
comes
,
and
without
knowing
why
or
wherefore
,
*NL*
finds
himself
invested
with
the
place
or
office
so
many
have
sued
for
;
*NL*
and
here
it
is
that
the
common
saying
,
`
There
is
good
luck
as
well
as
bad
*NL*
luck
in
suits
,
'
applies
.
Thou
,
who
,
to
my
thinking
,
art
beyond
all
doubt
*NL*
a
dullard
,
without
early
rising
or
night
watching
or
taking
any
trouble
,
*NL*
with
the
mere
breath
of
knight-errantry
that
has
breathed
upon
thee
,
*NL*
seest
thyself
without
more
ado
governor
of
an
island
,
as
though
it
were
a
*NL*
mere
matter
of
course
.
This
I
say
,
Sancho
,
that
thou
attribute
not
the
*NL*
favour
thou
hast
received
to
thine
own
merits
,
but
give
thanks
to
heaven
*NL*
that
disposes
matters
beneficently
,
and
secondly
thanks
to
the
great
*NL*
power
the
profession
of
knight-errantry
contains
in
itself
.
With
a
heart
,
*NL*
then
,
inclined
to
believe
what
I
have
said
to
thee
,
attend
,
my
son
,
to
*NL*
thy
Cato
here
who
would
counsel
thee
and
be
thy
polestar
and
guide
to
*NL*
direct
and
pilot
thee
to
a
safe
haven
out
of
this
stormy
sea
wherein
thou
*NL*
art
about
to
ingulf
thyself
;
for
offices
and
great
trusts
are
nothing
*NL*
else
but
a
mighty
gulf
of
troubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
,
my
son
,
thou
must
fear
God
,
for
in
the
fear
of
him
is
*NL*
wisdom
,
and
being
wise
thou
canst
not
err
in
aught
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Secondly
,
thou
must
keep
in
view
what
thou
art
,
striving
to
know
*NL*
thyself
,
the
most
difficult
thing
to
know
that
the
mind
can
imagine
.
If
*NL*
thou
knowest
thyself
,
it
will
follow
thou
wilt
not
puff
thyself
up
like
*NL*
the
frog
that
strove
to
make
himself
as
large
as
the
ox
;
if
thou
dost
,
*NL*
the
recollection
of
having
kept
pigs
in
thine
own
country
will
serve
as
*NL*
the
ugly
feet
for
the
wheel
of
thy
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
truth
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
that
was
when
I
was
a
boy
;
*NL*
afterwards
when
I
was
something
more
of
a
man
it
was
geese
I
kept
,
not
*NL*
pigs
.
But
to
my
thinking
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
;
for
all
who
are
*NL*
governors
do
n't
come
of
a
kingly
stock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
for
that
reason
those
who
are
not
of
noble
*NL*
origin
should
take
care
that
the
dignity
of
the
office
they
hold
be
*NL*
accompanied
by
a
gentle
suavity
,
which
wisely
managed
will
save
them
from
*NL*
the
sneers
of
malice
that
no
station
escapes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glory
in
thy
humble
birth
,
Sancho
,
and
be
not
ashamed
of
saying
thou
art
*NL*
peasant-born
;
for
when
it
is
seen
thou
art
not
ashamed
no
one
will
set
*NL*
himself
to
put
thee
to
the
blush
;
and
pride
thyself
rather
upon
being
one
*NL*
of
lowly
virtue
than
a
lofty
sinner
.
Countless
are
they
who
,
born
of
mean
*NL*
parentage
,
have
risen
to
the
highest
dignities
,
pontifical
and
imperial
,
*NL*
and
of
the
truth
of
this
I
could
give
thee
instances
enough
to
weary
*NL*
thee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
Sancho
,
if
thou
make
virtue
thy
aim
,

take
a
pride
in
doing
*NL*
virtuous
actions
,
thou
wilt
have
no
cause
to
envy
those
who
have
princely
*NL*
and
lordly
ones
,
for
blood
is
an
inheritance
,
but
virtue
an
acquisition
,
*NL*
and
virtue
has
in
itself
alone
a
worth
that
blood
does
not
possess

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
being
so

thee

art
not

repel

slight
him

on

contrary

welcome

*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
SECOND
SET
OF
COUNSELS
DON
QUIXOTE
GAVE
SANCHO
PANZA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Who
,
hearing
the
foregoing
discourse
of
Don
Quixote
,
would
not
have
set
*NL*
him
down
for
a
person
of
great
good
sense
and
greater
rectitude
of
*NL*
purpose
?
But
,
as
has
been
frequently
observed
in
the
course
of
this
great
*NL*
history
,
he
only
talked
nonsense
when
he
touched
on
chivalry
,
and
in
*NL*
discussing
all
other
subjects
showed
that
he
had
a
clear
and
unbiassed
*NL*
understanding
;
so
that
at
every
turn
his
acts
gave
the
lie
to
his
*NL*
intellect
,
and
his
intellect
to
his
acts
;
but
in
the
case
of
these
second
*NL*
counsels
that
he
gave
Sancho
,
he
showed
himself
to
have
a
lively
turn
of
*NL*
humour
,
and
displayed
conspicuously
his
wisdom
,
and
also
his
folly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
listened
to
him
with
the
deepest
attention
,
and
endeavoured
to
fix
*NL*
his
counsels
in
his
memory
,
like
one
who
meant
to
follow
them
and
by
*NL*
their
means
bring
the
full
promise
of
his
government
to
a
happy
issue
.
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
then
,
went
on
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
regard
to
the
mode
in
which
thou
shouldst

cut
thy

Ascertain
cautiously

thy

give

give

*NL*
``

said
Sancho
,
``
if
your
worship
thinks
I
'm
not
fit
for
this

government
,
I
give
it
up
on

;
for
the
mere
black
of
the
nail
of
*NL*
my
soul
is
dearer
to
me
than
my
whole

;

I
can
live
just
as
well

*NL*
simple
Sancho

on

as

on

while

we
're

great

But
if

you
will
see
it
*NL*
was
your

alone
that
put
me
on
to
this
business
of
governing

I
know
no
more
about
the

of
islands
than
a

there
's
any
reason
to
think
that
because
of
my
being
a

the
devil
*NL*
will
get
hold

I
'd
rather
go

governor
to

hell

*NL*

Thou
hast
good

no

commend

CHAPTER
XLIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
HOW
SANCHO
PANZA
WAS
CONDUCTED
TO
HIS
GOVERNMENT
,
AND
OF
THE
STRANGE
*NL*
ADVENTURE
THAT
BEFELL
DON
QUIXOTE
IN
THE
CASTLE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
stated
,
they
say
,
in
the
true
original
of
this
history
,
that
when
*NL*
Cide
Hamete
came
to
write
this
chapter
,
his
interpreter
did
not
translate
*NL*
it
as
he
wrote
it
--
that
is
,
as
a
kind
of
complaint
the
Moor
made
against
*NL*
himself
for
having
taken
in
hand
a
story
so
dry
and
of
so
little
variety
*NL*
as
this
of
Don
Quixote
,
for
he
found
himself
forced
to
speak
perpetually
*NL*
of
him
and
Sancho
,
without
venturing
to
indulge
in
digressions
and
*NL*
episodes
more
serious
and
more
interesting
.
He
said
,
too
,
that
to
go
on
,
*NL*
mind
,
hand
,
pen
always
restricted
to
writing
upon
one
single
subject
,
and
*NL*
speaking
through
the
mouths
of
a
few
characters
,
was
intolerable
*NL*
drudgery
,
the
result
of
which
was
never
equal
to
the
author
's
labour
,
and
*NL*
that
to
avoid
this
he
had
in
the
First
Part
availed
himself
of
the
device
*NL*
of
novels
,
like
``
The
Ill-advised
Curiosity
,
''
and
``
The
Captive
Captain
,
''
*NL*
which
stand
,
as
it
were
,
apart
from
the
story
;
the
others
are
given
there
*NL*
being
incidents
which
occurred
to
Don
Quixote
himself
and
could
not
be
*NL*
omitted
.
He
also
thought
,
he
says
,
that
many
,
engrossed
by
the
interest
*NL*
attaching
to
the
exploits
of
Don
Quixote
,
would
take
none
in
the
novels
,
*NL*
and
pass
them
over
hastily
or
impatiently
without
noticing
the
elegance
*NL*
and
art
of
their
composition
,
which
would
be
very
manifest
were
they
*NL*
published
by
themselves
and
not
as
mere
adjuncts
to
the
crazes
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
or
the
simplicities
of
Sancho
.
Therefore
in
this
Second
Part
he
*NL*
thought
it
best
not
to
insert
novels
,
either
separate
or
interwoven
,
but
*NL*
only
episodes
,
something
like
them
,
arising
out
of
the
circumstances
the
*NL*
facts
present
;
and
even
these
sparingly
,
and
with
no
more
words
than
*NL*
suffice
to
make
them
plain
;
and
as
he
confines
and
restricts
himself
to
*NL*
the
narrow
limits
of
the
narrative
,
though
he
has
ability
;
capacity
,
and
*NL*
brains
enough
to
deal
with
the
whole
universe
,
he
requests
that
his
*NL*
labours
may
not
be
despised
,
and
that
credit
be
given
him
,
not
alone
for
*NL*
what
he
writes
,
but
for
what
he
has
refrained
from
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
goes
on
with
his
story
,
saying
that
the
day
Don
Quixote
gave
*NL*
the
counsels
to
Sancho
,
the
same
afternoon
after
dinner
he
handed
them
to
*NL*
him
in
writing
so
that
he
might
get
some
one
to
read
them
to
him
.
They
*NL*
had
scarcely
,
however
,
been
given
to
him
when
he
let
them
drop
,
and
they
*NL*
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
duke
,
who
showed
them
to
the
duchess
and
they
*NL*
were
both
amazed
afresh
at
the
madness
and
wit
of
Don
Quixote
.
To
carry
*NL*
on
the
joke
,
then
,
the
same
evening
they
despatched
Sancho
with
a
large
*NL*
following
to
the
village
that
was
to
serve
him
for
an
island
.
It
happened
*NL*
that
the
person
who
had
him
in
charge
was
a
majordomo
of
the
duke
's
,
a
*NL*
man
of
great
discretion
and
humour
--
and
there
can
be
no
humour
without
*NL*
discretion
--
and
the
same
who
played
the
part
of
the
Countess
Trifaldi
in
*NL*
the
comical
way
that
has
been
already
described
;
and
thus
qualified
,
and
*NL*
instructed
by
his
master
and
mistress
as
to
how
to
deal
with
Sancho
,
he
*NL*
carried
out
their
scheme
admirably
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
as
soon
as
*NL*
Sancho
saw
this
majordomo
he
seemed
in
his
features
to
recognise
those
of
*NL*
the
Trifaldi
,
and
turning
to
his
master
,
he
said
to
him
,
``
Senor
,
either
*NL*
the
devil
will
carry
me
off
,
here
on
this
spot
,
righteous
and
believing
,
*NL*
or
your
worship
will
own
to
me
that
the
face
of
this
majordomo
of
the
*NL*
duke
's
here
is
the
very
face
of
the
Distressed
One
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
regarded
the
majordomo
attentively
,
and
having
done
so
,
said
*NL*
to
Sancho
,
``
There
is
no
reason
why
the
devil
should
carry
thee
off
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
either
righteous
or
believing
--
and
what
thou
meanest
by
that
I
*NL*
know
not
;
the
face
of
the
Distressed
One
is
that
of
the
majordomo
,
but
*NL*
for
all
that
the
majordomo
is
not
the
Distressed
One
;
for
his
being
so
*NL*
would
involve
a
mighty
contradiction
;
but
this
is
not
the
time
for
going
*NL*
into
questions
of
the
sort
,
which
would
be
involving
ourselves
in
an
*NL*
inextricable
labyrinth
.
Believe
me
,
my
friend
,
we
must
pray
earnestly
to
*NL*
our
Lord
that
he
deliver
us
both
from
wicked
wizards
and
enchanters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no
joke
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
before
this
I
heard
him
speak
,
*NL*
and
it
seemed
exactly
as
if
the
voice
of
the
Trifaldi
was
sounding
in
my
*NL*
ears
.
Well
,
I
'll
hold
my
peace
;
but
I
'll
take
care
to
be
on
the
look-out
*NL*
henceforth
for
any
sign
that
may
be
seen
to
confirm
or
do
away
with
this
*NL*
suspicion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
wilt
do
well
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
thou
wilt
let
me
know
*NL*
all
thou
discoverest
,
and
all
that
befalls
thee
in
thy
government
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
at
last
set
out
attended
by
a
great
number
of
people
.
He
was
*NL*
dressed
in
the
garb
of
a
lawyer
,
with
a
gaban
of
tawny
watered
camlet
*NL*
over
all
and
a
montera
cap
of
the
same
material
,
and
mounted
a
la
gineta
*NL*
upon
a
mule
.
Behind
him
,
in
accordance
with
the
duke
's
orders
,
followed
*NL*
Dapple
with
brand
new
ass-trappings
and
ornaments
of
silk
,
and
from
time
*NL*
to
time
Sancho
turned
round
to
look
at
his
ass
,
so
well
pleased
to
have
*NL*
him
with
him
that
he
would
not
have
changed
places
with
the
emperor
of
*NL*
Germany
.
On
taking
leave
he
kissed
the
hands
of
the
duke
and
duchess
and
*NL*
got
his
master
's
blessing
,
which
Don
Quixote
gave
him
with
tears
,
and
he
*NL*
received
blubbering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
worthy
Sancho
go
in
peace
,
and
good
luck
to
him
,
Gentle
Reader
;
and
*NL*
look
out
for
two
bushels
of
laughter
,
which
the
account
of
how
he
behaved
*NL*
himself
in
office
will
give
thee
.
In
the
meantime
turn
thy
attention
to
*NL*
what
happened
his
master
the
same
night
,
and
if
thou
dost
not
laugh
*NL*
thereat
,
at
any
rate
thou
wilt
stretch
thy
mouth
with
a
grin
;
for
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
adventures
must
be
honoured
either
with
wonder
or
with
*NL*
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
recorded
,
then
,
that
as
soon
as
Sancho
had
gone
,
Don
Quixote
felt
*NL*
his
loneliness
,
and
had
it
been
possible
for
him
to
revoke
the
mandate
*NL*
and
take
away
the
government
from
him
he
would
have
done
so
.
The
duchess
*NL*
observed
his
dejection
and
asked
him
why
he
was
melancholy
;
because
,
she
*NL*
said
,
if
it
was
for
the
loss
of
Sancho
,
there
were
squires
,
duennas
,
and
*NL*
damsels
in
her
house
who
would
wait
upon
him
to
his
full
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
truth
is
,
senora
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
I
do
feel
the
loss
of
*NL*
Sancho
;
but
that
is
not
the
main
cause
of
my
looking
sad
;
and
of
all
the
*NL*
offers
your
excellence
makes
me
,
I
accept
only
the
good-will
with
which
*NL*
they
are
made
,
and
as
to
the
remainder
I
entreat
of
your
excellence
to
*NL*
permit
and
allow
me
alone
to
wait
upon
myself
in
my
chamber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
that
must
not
be
;
four
of
*NL*
my
damsels
,
as
beautiful
as
flowers
,
shall
wait
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
they
will
not
be
flowers
,
but
thorns
to
*NL*
pierce
my
heart
.
They
,
or
anything
like
them
,
shall
as
soon
enter
my
*NL*
chamber
as
fly
.
If
your
highness
wishes
to
gratify
me
still
further
,
*NL*
though
I
deserve
it
not
,
permit
me
to
please
myself
,
and
wait
upon
myself
*NL*
in
my
own
room
;
for
I
place
a
barrier
between
my
inclinations
and
my
*NL*
virtue
,
and
I
do
not
wish
to
break
this
rule
through
the
generosity
your
*NL*
highness
is
disposed
to
display
towards
me
;
and
,
in
short
,
I
will
sleep
*NL*
in
my
clothes
,
sooner
than
allow
anyone
to
undress
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no
more
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
say
no
more
,
''
said
the
duchess
;
``
I
*NL*
assure
you
I
will
give
orders
that
not
even
a
fly
,
not
to
say
a
damsel
,
*NL*
shall
enter
your
room
.
I
am
not
the
one
to
undermine
the
propriety
of
*NL*
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
for
it
strikes
me
that
among
his
many
virtues
the
one
*NL*
that
is
pre-eminent
is
that
of
modesty
.
Your
worship
may
undress
and
*NL*
dress
in
private
and
in
your
own
way
,
as
you
please
and
when
you
please
,
*NL*
for
there
will
be
no
one
to
hinder
you
;
and
in
your
chamber
you
will
find
*NL*
all
the
utensils
requisite
to
supply
the
wants
of
one
who
sleeps
with
his
*NL*
door
locked
,
to
the
end
that
no
natural
needs
compel
you
to
open
it

May
*NL*
the
great
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
live
a
thousand
years
,
and
may
her
fame
*NL*
extend
all
over
the
surface
of
the
globe
,
for
she
deserves
to
be
loved
by
*NL*
a
knight
so
valiant
and
so
virtuous
;
and
may
kind
heaven
infuse
zeal
into
*NL*
the
heart
of
our
governor
Sancho
Panza
to
finish
off
his
discipline
*NL*
speedily
,
so
that
the
world
may
once
more
enjoy
the
beauty
of
so
grand
a
*NL*
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
replied
,
``
Your
highness
has
spoken
like
what
you
*NL*
are
;
from
the
mouth
of
a
noble
lady
nothing
bad
can
come
;

Dulcinea
*NL*
will
be
more
fortunate
,
and
better
known
to
the
world
by
the
praise
of
*NL*
your
highness
than
by
all
the
eulogies
the
greatest
orators
on

bestow
upon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
the
duchess
,
it
is
nearly
supper-time
,
*NL*

the
duke
is
probably
waiting
;
come
let
us
go
to
supper
,
and
retire
*NL*
to
rest
early
,
for
the
journey
you
made
yesterday
from
Kandy
was
not
such
*NL*
a
short
one

that
it
must
have
caused
you
some
fatigue
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
none

said
Don

,

I
would
go

my
life
I
never
mounted
a
quieter

beast
,

a
pleasanter
paced
one

than
Clavileno
;

I
do
n't
know

could
have
induced
Malambruno
to
discard
a
steed
so
swift

so
gentle

burn
it
so
recklessly

did

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the

crimes
he
must
have
committed

resolved

so
burned
Clavileno
as
the
chief

that

kept
him
restless

wandering
from

its
ashes

the
trophy

the
valour

ever

*NL*
*NL*
Don

renewed
his
thanks
to
the
duchess

and
having
supped
,
retired
*NL*
to
his
chamber
alone

refusing
to
allow
anyone
to
enter
with
him
to
wait

on

was
his
fear
of
encountering
temptations
that
might
lead
or
*NL*
drive
him
to
forget
his
chaste
fidelity
to
his
lady
Dulcinea
;
for
he
had
*NL*
always
present
to
his
mind
the
virtue
of
Amadis
,
that
flower
and
mirror
*NL*
of
knights-errant
.
He
locked
the
door
behind
him
,
and
by
the
light
of
two
*NL*
wax
candles
undressed
himself
,
but
as
he
was
taking
off
his
stockings
--
O
*NL*
disaster
unworthy
of
such
a
personage
!
--
there
came
a
burst
,
not
of
sighs
,
*NL*
or
anything
belying
his
delicacy
or
good
breeding
,
but
of
some
two
dozen
*NL*
stitches
in
one
of
his
stockings
,
that
made
it
look
like
a
*NL*
window-lattice
.
The
worthy
gentleman
was
beyond
measure
distressed
,
and
*NL*
at
that
moment
he
would
have
given
an
ounce
of
silver
to
have
had
half
a
*NL*
drachm
of
green
silk
there
;
I
say
green
silk
,
because
the
stockings
were
*NL*
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Cide
Hamete
exclaimed
as
he
was
writing
,
``
O
poverty
,
poverty
!
I
know
*NL*
not
what
could
have
possessed
the
great
Cordovan
poet
to
call
thee
`
holy
*NL*
gift
ungratefully
received
.
'
Although
a
Moor
,
I
know
well
enough
from
the
*NL*
intercourse
I
have
had
with
Christians
that
holiness
consists
in
charity
,
*NL*
humility
,
faith
,
obedience
,
and
poverty
;
but
for
all
that
,
I
say
he
must
*NL*
have
a
great
deal
of
godliness
who
can
find
any
satisfaction
in
being
*NL*
poor
;
unless
,
indeed
,
it
be
the
kind
of
poverty
one
of
their
greatest
*NL*
saints
refers
to
,
saying
,
`
possess
all
things
as
though
ye
possessed
them
*NL*
not
;
'
which
is
what
they
call
poverty
in
spirit
.
But
thou
,
that
other
*NL*
poverty
--
for
it
is
of
thee
I
am
speaking
now
--
why
dost
thou
love
to
fall
*NL*
out
with
gentlemen
and
men
of
good
birth
more
than
with
other
people
?
Why
*NL*
dost
thou
compel
them
to
smear
the
cracks
in
their
shoes
,
and
to
have
the
*NL*
buttons
of
their
coats
,
one
silk
,
another
hair
,
and
another
glass
?
Why
*NL*
must
their
ruffs
be
always
crinkled
like
endive
leaves
,
and
not
crimped
*NL*
with
a
crimping
iron
?
''
-LRB-
From
this
we
may
perceive
the
antiquity
of
starch
*NL*
and
crimped
ruffs
.
-RRB-
Then
he
goes
on
:
``
Poor
gentleman
of
good
family
!
*NL*
always
cockering
up
his
honour
,
dining
miserably
and
in
secret
,
and
*NL*
making
a
hypocrite
of
the
toothpick
with
which
he
sallies
out
into
the
*NL*
street
after
eating
nothing
to
oblige
him
to
use
it
!
Poor
fellow
,
I
say
,
*NL*
with
his
nervous
honour
,
fancying
they
perceive
a
league
off
the
patch
on
*NL*
his
shoe
,
the
sweat-stains
on
his
hat
,
the
shabbiness
of
his
cloak
,
and
*NL*
the
hunger
of
his
stomach
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
brought
home
to
Don
Quixote
by
the
bursting
of
his
stitches
;
*NL*
however
,
he
comforted
himself
on
perceiving
that
Sancho
had
left
behind
a
*NL*
pair
of
travelling
boots
,
which
he
resolved
to
wear
the
next
day
.
At
last
*NL*
he
went
to
bed
,
out
of
spirits
and
heavy
at
heart
,
as
much
because
he
*NL*
missed
Sancho
as
because
of
the
irreparable
disaster
to
his
stockings
,
*NL*
the
stitches
of
which
he
would
have
even
taken
up
with
silk
of
another
*NL*
colour
,
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
signs
of
poverty
a
gentleman
can
*NL*
show
in
the
course
of
his
never-failing
embarrassments
.
He
put
out
the
*NL*
candles
;
but
the
night
was
warm
and
he
could
not
sleep
;
he
rose
from
his
*NL*
bed
and
opened
slightly
a
grated
window
that
looked
out
on
a
beautiful
*NL*
garden
,
and
as
he
did
so
he
perceived
and
heard
people
walking
and
*NL*
talking
in
the
garden
.
He
set
himself
to
listen
attentively
,
and
those
*NL*
below
raised
their
voices
so
that
he
could
hear
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Urge
me
not
to
sing
,
Emerencia
,
for
thou
knowest
that
ever
since
this
*NL*
stranger
entered
the
castle
and
my
eyes
beheld
him
,
I
can
not
sing
but
*NL*
only
weep
;
besides
my
lady
is
a
light
rather
than
a
heavy
sleeper
,
and
I
*NL*
would
not
for
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
that
she
found
us
here
;
and
*NL*
even
if
she
were
asleep
and
did
not
waken
,
my
singing
would
be
in
vain
,
*NL*
if
this
strange
AEneas
,
who
has
come
into
my
neighbourhood
to
flout
me
,
*NL*
sleeps
on
and
wakens
not
to
hear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heed
not
that
,
dear
Altisidora
,
''
replied
a
voice
;
``
the
duchess
is
no
*NL*
doubt
asleep
,
and
everybody
in
the
house
save
the
lord
of
thy
heart
and
*NL*
disturber
of
thy
soul
;
for
just
now
I
perceived
him
open
the
grated
*NL*
window
of
his
chamber
,
so
he
must
be
awake
;
sing
,
my
poor
sufferer
,
in
a
*NL*
low
sweet
tone
to
the
accompaniment
of
thy
harp
;
and
even
if
the
duchess
*NL*
hears
us
we
can
lay
the
blame
on
the
heat
of
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
the
point
,
Emerencia
,
''
replied
Altisidora
,
``
it
is
that
I
*NL*
would
not
that
my
singing
should
lay
bare
my
heart
,
and
that
I
should
be
*NL*
thought
a
light
and
wanton
maiden
by
those
who
know
not
the
mighty
power
*NL*
of
love
;
but
come
what
may
;
better
a
blush
on
the
cheeks
than
a
sore
in
*NL*
the
heart
;
''
and
here
a
harp
softly
touched
made
itself
heard
.
As
he
*NL*
listened
to
all
this
Don
Quixote
was
in
a
state
of
breathless
amazement
,
*NL*
for
immediately
the
countless
adventures
like
this
,
with
windows
,
*NL*
gratings
,
gardens
,
serenades
,
lovemakings
,
and
languishings
,
that
he
had
*NL*
read
of
in
his
trashy
books
of
chivalry
,
came
to
his
mind
.
He
at
once
*NL*
concluded
that
some
damsel
of
the
duchess
's
was
in
love
with
him
,
and
*NL*
that
her
modesty
forced
her
to
keep
her
passion
secret
.
He
trembled
lest
*NL*
he
should
fall
,
and
made
an
inward
resolution
not
to
yield
;
and
*NL*
commending
himself
with
all
his
might
and
soul
to
his
lady
Dulcinea
he
*NL*
made
up
his
mind
to
listen
to
the
music
;
and
to
let
them
know
he
was
*NL*
there
he
gave
a
pretended
sneeze
,
at
which
the
damsels
were
not
a
little
*NL*
delighted
,
for
all
they
wanted
was
that
Don
Quixote
should
hear
them
.
So
*NL*
having
tuned
the
harp
,
Altisidora
,
running
her
hand
across
the
strings
,
*NL*
began
this
ballad
:
*NL*
*NL*
O
thou
that
art
above
in
bed
,
*NL*
Between
the
holland
sheets
,
*NL*
A-lying
there
from
night
till
morn
,
*NL*
With
outstretched
legs
asleep
;
*NL*
*NL*
O
thou
,
most
valiant
knight
of
all
*NL*
The
famed
Manchegan
breed
,
*NL*
Of
purity
and
virtue
more
*NL*
Than
gold
of

;
*NL*
*NL*
Give
ear
unto
a
suffering
maid
,
*NL*
Well-grown
but
evil-starr
'd
,
*NL*
For
those
two
suns
of
thine
have
lit
*NL*
A
fire
within
her
heart

*NL*
Adventures
seeking
thou
dost
rove

*NL*
To
others
bringing
woe
;

Thou
scatterest
wounds

but
,
ah

the
balm
*NL*
To
heal
them
dost
withhold
!

Say
,
valiant
youth
,
and
so
may
God
*NL*
Thy
enterprises
speed

Didst
thou

mid
Libya

sands

Or
Jaca

first
see

*NL*
*NL*
Did

give
thee

nursed
thee
when
a

Wert
cradled
in
the
forest

*NL*
*NL*
O
Dulcinea
may
be
proud
,
*NL*
That
plump
and
lusty
maid
;
*NL*
For
she
alone
hath
had
the
power
*NL*
A
tiger
fierce
to
tame

*NL*
*NL*
Fain
would
I
change
with

,

give
*NL*
A
petticoat
to
boot

*NL*
The
best

bravest
that
I

trimmed

O

enfold

I
rave

silver-laced

Would
I
on

What

make
for
thee

What
fine
long

cloaks

*NL*
And
I
would
give
thee
pearls

As
big

show

So
matchless
big

By

Altisidora

*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
lay
of
the
heart-stricken
Altisidora
came
to
an
end
,
while
the
*NL*
warmly
wooed
Don
Quixote
began
to
feel
alarm
;
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
,
``
O
that
I
should
be
such
an
unlucky
knight
that
no
*NL*
damsel
can
set
eyes
on
me
but
falls
in
love
with
me
!
O
that
the
peerless
*NL*
Dulcinea
should
be
so
unfortunate
that
they
can
not
let
her
enjoy
my
*NL*
incomparable
constancy
in
peace
!
What
would
ye
with
her
,
ye
queens
?
Why
*NL*
do
ye
persecute
her
,
ye
empresses
?
Why
ye
pursue
her
,
ye
virgins
of
from
*NL*
fourteen
to
fifteen
?
Leave
the
unhappy
being
to
triumph
,
rejoice
and
*NL*
glory
in
the
lot
love
has
been
pleased
to
bestow
upon
her
in
surrendering
*NL*
my
heart
and
yielding
up
my
soul
to
her
.
Ye
love-smitten
host
,
know
that
*NL*
to
Dulcinea
only
I
am
dough
and
sugar-paste
,
flint
to
all
others
;
for
her
*NL*
I
am
honey
,
for
you
aloes

For
me
Dulcinea
alone
is
beautiful
,
wise
,
*NL*
virtuous
,
graceful
,
and
high-bred
,
and
all
others
are
ill-favoured
,
*NL*
foolish
,
light
,
and
low-born
.
Nature
sent
me
into
the
world
to
be
hers
*NL*
and
no
other
's
;
Altisidora
may
weep
or
sing
,
the
lady
for
whose
sake
they
*NL*
belaboured
me
in
the
castle
of
the
enchanted
Moor
may
give
way
to
*NL*
despair

but
I
must
be
Dulcinea

boiled

pure

courteous

chaste
,
in

all

And
with
that
*NL*
he
shut
the
window
with
a
bang
,
and
,
as
much
out
of
temper
and
out
of
*NL*
sorts
as
if
some
great
misfortune
had
befallen
him

stretched
himself
on

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
OF
HOW
THE
GREAT
SANCHO
PANZA
TOOK
POSSESSION
OF
HIS
ISLAND
,
AND
OF
HOW
*NL*
HE
MADE
A
BEGINNING
IN
GOVERNING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
O
perpetual
discoverer
of
the
antipodes
,
torch
of
the
world
,
eye
of
*NL*
heaven
,
sweet
stimulator
of
the
water-coolers
!
Thimbraeus
here
,
Phoebus
*NL*
there
,
now
archer
,
now
physician
,
father
of
poetry
,
inventor
of
music
;
*NL*
thou
that
always
risest
and
,
notwithstanding
appearances
,
never
settest
!
*NL*
To
thee
,
O
Sun
,
by
whose
aid
man
begetteth
man
,
to
thee
I
appeal
to
help
*NL*
me
and
lighten
the
darkness
of
my
wit
that
I
may
be
able
to
proceed
with
*NL*
scrupulous
exactitude
in
giving
an
account
of
the
great
Sancho
Panza
's
*NL*
government
;
for
without
thee
I
feel
myself
weak
,
feeble
,
and
uncertain
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
come
to
the
point
,
then
--
Sancho
with
all
his
attendants
arrived
at
a
*NL*
village
of
some
thousand
inhabitants
,
and
one
of
the
largest
the
duke
*NL*
possessed
.
They
informed
him
that
it
was
called
the
island
of
Barataria
,
*NL*
either
because
the
name
of
the
village
was
Baratario
,
or
because
of
the
*NL*
joke
by
way
of
which
the
government
had
been
conferred
upon
him
.
On
*NL*
reaching
the
gates
of
the
town
,
which
was
a
walled
one
,
the
municipality
*NL*
came
forth
to
meet
him
,
the
bells
rang
out
a
peal
,
and
the
inhabitants
*NL*
showed
every
sign
of
general
satisfaction
;
and
with
great
pomp
they
*NL*
conducted
him
to
the
principal
church
to
give
thanks
to
God
,
and
then
*NL*
with
burlesque
ceremonies
they
presented
him
with
the
keys
of
the
town
,
*NL*
and
acknowledged
him
as
perpetual
governor
of
the
island
of
Barataria
.
*NL*
The
costume
,
the
beard
,
and
the
fat
squat
figure
of
the
new
governor
*NL*
astonished
all
those
who
were
not
in
on
the
secret
,
and
even
all
who
were
,
*NL*
and
they
were
not
a
few
.
Finally
,
leading
him
out
of
the
church
they
*NL*
carried
him
to
the
judgment
seat
and
seated
him
on
it
,
and
the
duke
's
*NL*
majordomo
said
to
him
,
``
It
is
an
ancient
custom
in
this
island
,
senor
*NL*
governor
,
that
he
who
comes
to
take
possession
of
this
famous
island
is
*NL*
bound
to
answer
a
question
which
shall
be
put
to
him
,
and
which
must
be
a
*NL*
somewhat
knotty
and
difficult
one
;
and
by
his
answer
the
people
take
the
*NL*
measure
of
their
new
governor
's
wit
,
and
hail
with
joy
or
deplore
his
*NL*
arrival
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
majordomo
was
making
this
speech
Sancho
was
gazing
at
several
*NL*
large
letters
inscribed
on
the
wall
opposite
his
seat
,
and
as
he
could
*NL*
not
read
he
asked
what
that
was
that
was
painted
on
the
wall
.
The
answer
*NL*
was
,
``
Senor
,
there
is
written
and
recorded
the
day
on
which
your
lordship
*NL*
took
possession
of
this
island
,
and
the
inscription
says
,
`
This
day
,
the
*NL*
so-and-so
of
such-and-such
a
month
and
year
,
Senor
Don
Sancho
Panza
took
*NL*
possession
of
this
island
;
many
years
may
he
enjoy
it
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whom
do
they
call
Don
Sancho
Panza
?
''
asked
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
lordship
,
''
replied
the
majordomo
;
``
for
no
other
Panza
but
the
one
*NL*
who
is
now
seated
in
that
chair
has
ever
entered
this
island
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
let
me
tell
you
,
brother
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
I
have
n't
got
the
*NL*
`
Don
,
'
nor
has
any
one
of
my
family
ever
had
it
;
my
name
is
plain
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
,
and
Sancho
was
my
father
's
name
,
and
Sancho
was
my
grandfather
's
*NL*
and
they
were
all
Panzas
,
without
any
Dons
or
Donas
tacked
on
;
I
suspect
*NL*
that
in
this
island
there
are
more
Dons
than
stones
;
but
never
mind
;
God
*NL*
knows
what
I
mean
,
and
maybe
if
my
government
lasts
four
days
I
'll
weed
*NL*
out
these
Dons
that
no
doubt
are
as
great
a
nuisance
as
the
midges
,
*NL*
they
're
so
plenty
.
Let
the
majordomo
go
on
with
his
question
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
give
the
best
answer
I
can
,
whether
the
people
deplore
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
there
came
into
court
two
old
men
,
one
carrying
a
cane
by
*NL*
way
of
a
walking-stick
,
and
the
one
who
had
no
stick
said
,
``
Senor
,
some
*NL*
time
ago
I
lent
this
good
man
ten
gold-crowns
in
gold
to
gratify
him
and
*NL*
do
him
a
service
,
on
the
condition
that
he
was
to
return
them
to
me
*NL*
whenever
I
should
ask
for
them
.
A
long
time
passed
before
I
asked
for
*NL*
them
,
for
I
would
not
put
him
to
any
greater
straits
to
return
them
than
*NL*
he
was
in
when
I
lent
them
to
him
;
but
thinking
he
was
growing
careless
*NL*
about
payment
I
asked
for
them
once
and
several
times
;
and
not
only
will
*NL*
he
not
give
them
back
,
but
he
denies
that
he
owes
them
,
and
says
I
never
*NL*
lent
him
any
such
crowns
;
or
if
I
did
,
that
he
repaid
them
;
and
I
have
no
*NL*
witnesses
either
of
the
loan
,
or
the
payment
,
for
he
never
paid
me
;
I
*NL*
want
your
worship
to
put
him
to
his
oath
,
and
if
he
swears
he
returned
*NL*
them
to
me
I
forgive
him
the
debt
here
and
before
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say
you
to
this
,
good
old
man
,
you
with
the
stick
?
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
old
man
replied
,
``
I
admit
,
senor
,
that
he
lent
them
to
me
;
*NL*
but
let
your
worship
lower
your
staff
,
and
as
he
leaves
it
to
my
oath
,
*NL*
I
'll
swear
that
I
gave
them
back
,
and
paid
him
really
and
truly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
governor
lowered
the
staff
,
and
as
he
did
so
the
old
man
who
had
the
*NL*
stick
handed
it
to
the
other
old
man
to
hold
for
him
while
he
swore
,
as
*NL*
if
he
found
it
in
his
way
;
and
then
laid
his
hand
on
the
cross
of
the
*NL*
staff
,
saying
that
it
was
true
the
ten
crowns
that
were
demanded
of
him
*NL*
had
been
lent
him
;
but
that
he
had
with
his
own
hand
given
them
back
into
*NL*
the
hand
of
the
other
,
and
that
he
,
not
recollecting
it
,
was
always
*NL*
asking
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
this
the
great
governor
asked
the
creditor
what
answer
he
had
to
*NL*
make
to
what
his
opponent
said
.
He
said
that
no
doubt
his
debtor
had
told
*NL*
the
truth
,
for
he
believed
him
to
be
an
honest
man
and
a
good
Christian
,
*NL*
and
he
himself
must
have
forgotten
when
and
how
he
had
given
him
back
the
*NL*
crowns
;
and
that
from
that
time
forth
he
would
make
no
further
demand
*NL*
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
debtor
took
his
stick
again
,
and
bowing
his
head
left
the
court
.
*NL*
Observing
this
,
and
how
,
without
another
word
,
he
made
off
,
and
observing
*NL*
too
the
resignation
of
the
plaintiff
,
Sancho
buried
his
head
in
his
bosom
*NL*
and
remained
for
a
short
space
in
deep
thought
,
with
the
forefinger
of
*NL*
his
right
hand
on
his
brow
and
nose
;
then
he
raised
his
head
and
bade
*NL*
them
call
back
the
old
man
with
the
stick
,
for
he
had
already
taken
his
*NL*
departure
.
They
brought
him
back
,
and
as
soon
as
Sancho
saw
him
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Honest
man
,
give
me
that
stick
,
for
I
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly
,
''
said
the
old
man
;
``
here
it
is
senor
,
''
and
he
put
it
into
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
took
it
and
,
handing
it
to
the
other
old
man
,
said
to
him
,
``
Go
,
*NL*
and
God
be
with
you
;
for
now
you
are
paid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
senor
!
''
returned
the
old
man
;
``
why
,
is
this
cane
worth
ten
*NL*
gold-crowns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
governor
,
``
or
if
not
I
am
the
greatest
dolt
in
the
world
;
*NL*
now
you
will
see
whether
I
have
got
the
headpiece
to
govern
a
whole
*NL*
kingdom
;
''
and
he
ordered
the
cane
to
be
broken
in
two
,
there
,
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
all
.
It
was
done
,
and
in
the
middle
of
it
they
found
ten
*NL*
gold-crowns
.
All
were
filled
with
amazement
,
and
looked
upon
their
*NL*
governor
as
another
Solomon
.
They
asked
him
how
he
had
come
to
the
*NL*
conclusion
that
the
ten
crowns
were
in
the
cane
;
he
replied
,
that
*NL*
observing
how
the
old
man
who
swore
gave
the
stick
to
his
opponent
while
*NL*
he
was
taking
the
oath
,
and
swore
that
he
had
really
and
truly
given
him
*NL*
the
crowns
,
and
how
as
soon
as
he
had
done
swearing
he
asked
for
the
*NL*
stick
again
,
it
came
into
his
head
that
the
sum
demanded
must
be
inside
*NL*
it
;
and
from
this
he
said
it
might
be
seen
that
God
sometimes
guides
*NL*
those
who
govern
in
their
judgments
,
even
though
they
may
be
fools
;
*NL*
besides
he
had
himself
heard
the
curate
of
his
village
mention
just
such
*NL*
another
case
,
and
he
had
so
good
a
memory
,
that
if
it
was
not
that
he
*NL*
forgot
everything
he
wished
to
remember
,
there
would
not
be
such
a
memory
*NL*
in
all
the
island
.
To
conclude
,
the
old
men
went
off
,
one
crestfallen
,
*NL*
and
the
other
in
high
contentment
,
all
who
were
present
were
astonished
,
*NL*
and
he
who
was
recording
the
words
,
deeds
,
and
movements
of
Sancho
could
*NL*
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
was
to
look
upon
him
and
set
him
down
as
*NL*
a
fool
or
as
a
man
of
sense
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
this
case
was
disposed
of
,
there
came
into
court
a
woman
*NL*
holding
on
with
a
tight
grip
to
a
man
dressed
like
a
well-to-do
cattle
*NL*
dealer
,
and
she
came
forward
making
a
great
outcry
and
exclaiming
,
*NL*
``
Justice
,
senor
governor
,
justice
!
and
if
I
do
n't
get
it
on
earth
I
'll
go
*NL*
look
for
it
in
heaven
.
Senor
governor
of
my
soul
,
this
wicked
man
caught
*NL*
me
in
the
middle
of
the
fields
here
and
used
my
body
as
if
it
was
an
*NL*
ill-washed
rag
,
and
,
woe
is
me
!
got
from
me
what
I
had
kept
these
*NL*
three-and-twenty
years
and
more
,
defending
it
against
Moors
and
*NL*
Christians
,
natives
and
strangers
;
and
I
always
as
hard
as
an
oak
,
and
*NL*
keeping
myself
as
pure
as
a
salamander
in
the
fire
,
or
wool
among
the
*NL*
brambles
,
for
this
good
fellow
to
come
now
with
clean
hands
to
handle
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
remains
to
be
proved
whether
this
gallant
has
clean
hands
or
not
,
''
*NL*
said
Sancho
;
and
turning
to
the
man
he
asked
him
what
he
had
to
say
in
*NL*
answer
to
the
woman
's
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
all
in
confusion
made
answer
,
``
Sirs
,
I
am
a
poor
pig
dealer
,
and
this
*NL*
morning
I
left
the
village
to
sell
-LRB-
saving
your
presence
-RRB-
four
pigs
,
and
*NL*
between
dues
and
cribbings
they
got
out
of
me
little
less
than
the
worth
*NL*
of
them
.
As
I
was
returning
to
my
village
I
fell
in
on
the
road
with
this
*NL*
good
dame
,
and
the
devil
who
makes
a
coil
and
a
mess
out
of
everything
,
*NL*
yoked
us
together
.
I
paid
her
fairly
,
but
she
not
contented
laid
hold
of
*NL*
me
and
never
let
go
until
she
brought
me
here
;
she
says
I
forced
her
,
but
*NL*
she
lies
by
the
oath
I
swear
or
am
ready
to
swear
;
and
this
is
the
whole
*NL*
truth
and
every
particle
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
governor
on
this
asked
him
if
he
had
any
money
in
silver
about
him
;
*NL*
he
said
he
had
about
twenty
ducats
in
a
leather
purse
in
his
bosom
.
The
*NL*
governor
bade
him
take
it
out
and
hand
it
to
the
complainant
;
he
obeyed
*NL*
trembling
;
the
woman
took
it
,
and
making
a
thousand
salaams
to
all
and
*NL*
praying
to
God
for
the
long
life
and
health
of
the
senor
governor
who
had
*NL*
such
regard
for
distressed
orphans
and
virgins
,
she
hurried
out
of
court
*NL*
with
the
purse
grasped
in
both
her
hands
,
first
looking
,
however
,
to
see
*NL*
if
the
money
it
contained
was
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
was
gone
Sancho
said
to
the
cattle
dealer
,
whose
tears
*NL*
were
already
starting
and
whose
eyes
and
heart
were
following
his
purse
,
*NL*
``
Good
fellow
,
go
after
that
woman
and
take
the
purse
from
her
,
by
force
*NL*
even
,
and
come
back
with
it
here
;
''
and
he
did
not
say
it
to
one
who
was
a
*NL*
fool
or
deaf
,
for
the
man
was
off
like
a
flash
of
lightning
,
and
ran
to
*NL*
do
as
he
was
bid
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
bystanders
waited
anxiously
to
see
the
end
of
the
case
,
and
*NL*
presently
both
man
and
woman
came
back
at
even
closer
grips
than
before
,
*NL*
she
with
her
petticoat
up
and
the
purse
in
the
lap
of
it
,
and
he
*NL*
struggling
hard
to
take
it
from
her
,
but
all
to
no
purpose
,
so
stout
was
*NL*
the
woman
's
defence
,
she
all
the
while
crying
out
,
``
Justice
from
God
and
*NL*
the
world
!
see
here
,
senor
governor
,
the
shamelessness
and
boldness
of
*NL*
this
villain
,
who
in
the
middle
of
the
town
,
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
*NL*
wanted
to
take
from
me
the
purse
your
worship
bade
him
give
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
he
take
it
?
''
asked
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
!
''
said
the
woman
;
``
I
'd
let
my
life
be
taken
from
me
sooner
than
*NL*
the
purse
.
A
pretty
child
I
'd
be
!
It
's
another
sort
of
cat
they
must
*NL*
throw
in
my
face
,
and
not
that
poor
scurvy
knave
.
Pincers
and
hammers
,
*NL*
mallets
and
chisels
would
not
get
it
out
of
my
grip
;
no
,
nor
lions
'
*NL*
claws
;
the
soul
from
out
of
my
body
first
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
right
,
''
said
the
man
;
``
I
own
myself
beaten
and
powerless
;
I
*NL*
confess
I
have
n't
the
strength
to
take
it
from
her
;
''
and
he
let
go
his
*NL*
hold
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
the
governor
said
to
the
woman
,
``
Let
me
see
that
purse
,
my
*NL*
worthy
and
sturdy
friend
.
''
She
handed
it
to
him
at
once
,
and
the
governor
*NL*
returned
it
to
the
man
,
and
said
to
the
unforced
mistress
of
force
,
*NL*
``
Sister
,
if
you
had
shown
as
much
,
or
only
half
as
much

spirit
and
*NL*
vigour
in
defending
your
body
as
you
have
shown
in
defending
that
purse
,
*NL*
the
strength
of
Hercules
could
not
have
forced
you
.
Be
off
,
and
God
speed
*NL*
you
,
and
bad
luck
to
you
,
and
do
n't
show
your
face
in
all
this
island

or
*NL*
within
six
leagues
of
it
on
any
side

under
pain
of
two
hundred
lashes
;
*NL*
be
off
at
once

I
say
,
you
shameless

cheating
shrew

*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
was
cowed
and
went
off
disconsolately
,
hanging
her
head
;
and
*NL*
the
governor
said
to
the
man
,
``
Honest
man
,
go
home
with
your
money
,
and
*NL*
God
speed
you
;
and
for
the
future
,
if
you
do
n't
want
to
lose
it
,
see
that
*NL*
you
do
n't
take
it
into
your
head
to
yoke
with
anybody
.
''
The
man
thanked
*NL*
him
as
clumsily
as
he
could
and
went
his
way
,
and
the
bystanders
were
*NL*
again
filled
with
admiration
at
their
new
governor
's
judgments
and
*NL*
sentences
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
two
men
,
one
apparently
a
farm
labourer
,
and
the
other
a
tailor
,
*NL*
for
he
had
a
pair
of
shears
in
his
hand
,
presented
themselves
before
him
,
*NL*
and
the
tailor
said
,
``
Senor
governor
,
this
labourer
and
I
come
before
*NL*
your
worship
by
reason
of
this
honest
man
coming
to
my
shop
yesterday
*NL*
-LRB-
for
saving
everybody
's
presence
I
'm
a
passed
tailor
,
God
be
thanked
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
putting
a
piece
of
cloth
into
my
hands
and
asking
me
,
`
Senor
,
will
*NL*
there
be
enough
in
this
cloth
to
make
me
a
cap
?
'
Measuring
the
cloth
I
*NL*
said
there
would
.
He
probably
suspected
--
as
I
supposed
,
and
I
supposed
*NL*
right
--
that
I
wanted
to
steal
some
of
the
cloth
,
led
to
think
so
by
his
*NL*
own
roguery
and
the
bad
opinion
people
have
of
tailors
;
and
he
told
me
to
*NL*
see
if
there
would
be
enough
for
two
.
I
guessed
what
he
would
be
at
,
and
*NL*
I
said
`
yes
.
'
He
,
still
following
up
his
original
unworthy
notion
,
went
*NL*
on
adding
cap
after
cap
,
and
I
`
yes
'
after
`
yes
,
'
until
we
got
as
far
as
*NL*
five
.
He
has
just
this
moment
come
for
them
;
I
gave
them
to
him
,
but
he
*NL*
wo
n't
pay
me
for
the
making
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
calls
upon
me
to
pay
*NL*
him
,
or
else
return
his
cloth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
all
this
true
,
brother
?
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
man
;
``
but
will
your
worship
make
him
show
the
five
*NL*
caps
he
has
made
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
,
''
said
the
tailor
;
and
drawing
his
hand
from
under
his
*NL*
cloak
he
showed
five
caps
stuck
upon
the
five
fingers
of
it
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
there
are
the
caps
this
good
man
asks
for
;
and
by
God
and
upon
my
*NL*
conscience
I
have
n't
a
scrap
of
cloth
left
,
and
I
'll
let
the
work
be
*NL*
examined
by
the
inspectors
of
the
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
present
laughed
at
the
number
of
caps
and
the
novelty
of
the
suit
;
*NL*
Sancho
set
himself
to
think
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
``
It
seems
to
me
*NL*
that
in
this
case
it
is
not
necessary
to
deliver
long-winded
arguments
,
*NL*
but
only
to
give
off-hand
the
judgment
of
an
honest
man
;
and
so
my
*NL*
decision
is
that
the
tailor
lose
the
making
and
the
labourer
the
cloth
,
*NL*
and
that
the
caps
go
to
the
prisoners
in
the
gaol
,
and
let
there
be
no
*NL*
more
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
previous
decision
about
the
cattle
dealer
's
purse
excited
the
*NL*
admiration
of
the
bystanders
,
this
provoked
their
laughter
;
however
,
the
*NL*
governor
's
orders
were
after
all
executed
.
All
this
,
having
been
taken
*NL*
down
by
his
chronicler
,
was
at
once
despatched
to
the
duke
,
who
was
*NL*
looking
out
for
it
with
great
eagerness
;
and
here
let
us
leave
the
good
*NL*
Sancho
;
for
his
master
,
sorely
troubled
in
mind
by
Altisidora
's
music
,
*NL*
has
pressing
claims
upon
us
now
.

CHAPTER
XLVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
TERRIBLE
BELL
AND
CAT
FRIGHT
THAT
DON
QUIXOTE
GOT
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
*NL*
THE
ENAMOURED
ALTISIDORA
'S
WOOING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
Don
Quixote
wrapped
up
in
the
reflections
which
the
music
of
the
*NL*
enamourned
maid
Altisidora
had
given
rise
to
.
He
went
to
bed
with
them
,
*NL*
and
just
like
fleas
they
would
not
let
him
sleep
or
get
a
moment
's
rest
,
*NL*
and
the
broken
stitches
of
his
stockings
helped
them
.
But
as
Time
is
*NL*
fleet
and
no
obstacle
can
stay
his
course
,
he
came
riding
on
the
hours
,
*NL*
and
morning
very
soon
arrived
.
Seeing
which
Don
Quixote
quitted
the
soft
*NL*
down
,
and
,
nowise
slothful
,
dressed
himself
in
his
chamois
suit
and
put
*NL*
on
his
travelling
boots
to
hide
the
disaster
to
his
stockings
.
He
threw
*NL*
over
him
his
scarlet
mantle
,
put
on
his
head
a
montera
of
green
velvet
*NL*
trimmed
with
silver
edging
,
flung
across
his
shoulder
the
baldric
with
*NL*
his
good
trenchant
sword
,
took
up
a
large
rosary
that
he
always
carried
*NL*
with
him
,
and
with
great
solemnity
and
precision
of
gait
proceeded
to
the
*NL*
antechamber
where
the
duke
and
duchess
were
already
dressed
and
waiting
*NL*
for
him
.
But
as
he
passed
through
a
gallery
,
Altisidora
and
the
other
*NL*
damsel
,
her
friend
,
were
lying
in
wait
for
him
,
and
the
instant
*NL*
Altisidora
saw
him
she
pretended
to
faint
,
while
her
friend
caught
her
in
*NL*
her
lap
,
and
began
hastily
unlacing
the
bosom
of
her
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
observed
it
,
and
approaching
them
said
,
``
I
know
very
well
*NL*
what
this
seizure
arises
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
not
from
what
,
''
replied
the
friend
,
``
for
Altisidora
is
the
*NL*
healthiest
damsel
in
all
this
house
,
and
I
have
never
heard
her
complain
*NL*
all
the
time
I
have
known
her
.
A
plague
on
all
the
knights-errant
in
the
*NL*
world
,
if
they
be
all
ungrateful
!
Go
away
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
;
for
this
*NL*
poor
child
will
not
come
to
herself
again
so
long
as
you
are
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
returned
,
``
Do
me
the
favour
,
senora
,
to
let
a
lute
*NL*
be
placed
in
my
chamber
to-night
;
and
I
will
comfort
this
poor
maiden
to
*NL*
the
best
of
my
power
;
for
in
the
early
stages
of
love
a
prompt
*NL*
disillusion
is
an
approved
remedy
;
''
and
with
this
he
retired
,
so
as
not
*NL*
to
be
remarked
by
any
who
might
see
him
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scarcely
withdrawn
when
Altisidora
,
recovering
from
her
swoon
,
*NL*
said
to
her
companion
,
``
The
lute
must
be
left
,
for
no
doubt
Don
Quixote
*NL*
intends
to
give
us
some
music
;
and
being
his
it
will
not
be
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
at
once
to
inform
the
duchess
of
what
was
going
on
,
and
of
the
*NL*
lute
Don
Quixote
asked
for
,
and
she
,
delighted
beyond
measure
,
plotted
*NL*
with
the
duke
and
her
two
damsels
to
play
him
a
trick
that
should
be
*NL*
amusing
but
harmless
;
and
in
high
glee
they
waited
for
night
,
which
came
*NL*
quickly
as
the
day
had
come
;
and
as
for
the
day
,
the
duke
and
duchess
*NL*
spent
it
in
charming
conversation
with
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
eleven
o'clock
came
,
Don
Quixote
found
a
guitar
in
his
chamber
;
he
*NL*
tried
it
,
opened
the
window
,
and
perceived
that
some
persons
were
walking
*NL*
in
the
garden
;
and
having
passed
his
fingers
over
the
frets
of
the
guitar
*NL*
and
tuned
it
as
well
as
he
could
,
he
spat
and
cleared
his
chest
,
and
then
*NL*
with
a
voice
a
little
hoarse
but
full-toned
,
he
sang
the
following
*NL*
ballad
,
which
he
had
himself
that
day
composed
:
*NL*
*NL*
Mighty
Love
the
hearts
of
maidens
*NL*
Doth
unsettle
and
perplex
,
*NL*
And
the
instrument
he
uses
*NL*
Most
of
all
is
idleness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sewing
,
stitching
,
any
labour
,
*NL*
Having
always
work
to
do
,
*NL*
To
the
poison
Love
instilleth
*NL*
Is
the
antidote
most
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
to
proper-minded
maidens
*NL*
Who
desire
the
matron
's
name
*NL*
Modesty
's
a
marriage
portion
,
*NL*
Modesty
their
highest
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
of
prudence
and
discretion
,
*NL*
Courtiers
gay
and
gallant
knights
,
*NL*
With
the
wanton
damsels

,
*NL*
But
the
modest
take
to

.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are

,
fleeting

Sunrise

with

When

*NL*
Love
that
springs
up
swift
and
sudden
,
*NL*
Here
to-day
,
to-morrow
flown
,
*NL*
Passes
,
leaves
no
trace
behind
it
,
*NL*
Leaves
no
image
on
the
soul

*NL*
*NL*
Painting
that
is
laid

Maketh
no

*NL*
*NL*
The
quality
of
all
in
lovers
*NL*
Most
esteemed
is
constancy
;
*NL*
'
T
is
by
this
that
love
works
wonders
,
*NL*
This
exalts
them
to
the
skies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
had
got
so
far
with
his
song
,
to
which
the
duke
,
the
duchess
,
*NL*
Altisidora
,
and
nearly
the
whole
household
of
the
castle
were
listening
,
*NL*
when
all
of
a
sudden
from
a
gallery
above
that
was
exactly
over
his
*NL*
window
they
let
down
a
cord
with
more
than
a
hundred
bells
attached
to
*NL*
it
,
and
immediately
after
that
discharged
a
great
sack
full
of
cats
,
*NL*
which
also
had
bells
of
smaller
size
tied
to
their
tails
.
Such
was
the
*NL*
din
of
the
bells
and
the
squalling
of
the
cats
,
that
though
the
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
were
the
contrivers
of
the
joke
they
were
startled
by
it
,
while
*NL*
Don
Quixote
stood
paralysed
with
fear
;
and
as
luck
would
have
it
,
two
or
*NL*
three
of
the
cats
made
their
way
in
through
the
grating
of
his
chamber
,
*NL*
and
flying
from
one
side
to
the
other
,
made
it
seem
as
if
there
was
a
*NL*
legion
of
devils
at
large
in
it
.
They
extinguished
the
candles
that
were
*NL*
burning
in
the
room
,
and
rushed
about
seeking
some
way
of
escape
;
the
*NL*
cord
with
the
large
bells
never
ceased
rising
and
falling
;
and
most
of
*NL*
the
people
of
the
castle
,
not
knowing
what
was
really
the
matter
,
were
at
*NL*
their
wits
'
end
with
astonishment
.
Don
Quixote
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
*NL*
drawing
his
sword
,
began
making
passes
at
the
grating
,
shouting
out
,
*NL*
``
Avaunt
,
malignant
enchanters
!
avaunt
,
ye
witchcraft-working
rabble
!
I
am
*NL*
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
against
whom
your
evil
machinations
avail
not
*NL*
nor
have
any
power
.
''
And
turning
upon
the
cats
that
were
running
about
*NL*
the
room
,
he
made
several
cuts
at
them
.
They
dashed
at
the
grating
and
*NL*
escaped
by
it
,
save
one
that
,
finding
itself
hard
pressed
by
the
slashes
*NL*
of
Don
Quixote
's
sword
,
flew
at
his
face
and
held
on
to
his
nose
tooth
*NL*
and
nail
,
with
the
pain
of
which
he
began
to
shout
his
loudest
.
The
duke
*NL*
and
duchess
hearing
this
,
and
guessing
what
it
was
,
ran
with
all
haste
to
*NL*
his
room
,
and
as
the
poor
gentleman
was
striving
with
all
his
might
to
*NL*
detach
the
cat
from
his
face
,
they
opened
the
door
with
a
master-key
and
*NL*
went
in
with
lights
and
witnessed
the
unequal
combat
.
The
duke
ran
*NL*
forward
to
part
the
combatants
,
but
Don
Quixote
cried
out
aloud
,
``
Let
no
*NL*
one
take
him
from
me
;
leave
me
hand
to
hand
with
this
demon
,
this
wizard
,
*NL*
this
enchanter
;
I
will
teach
him
,
I
myself
,
who
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
*NL*
is
.
''
The
cat
,
however
,
never
minding
these
threats
,
snarled
and
held
on
;
*NL*
but
at
last
the
duke
pulled
it
off
and
flung
it
out
of
the
window
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
left
with
a
face
as
full
of
holes
as
a
sieve
and
a
nose
not
*NL*
in
very
good
condition
,
and
greatly
vexed
that
they
did
not
let
him
*NL*
finish
the
battle
he
had
been
so
stoutly
fighting
with
that
villain
of
an
*NL*
enchanter
.
They
sent
for
some
oil
of
John
's
wort
,
and
Altisidora
herself
*NL*
with
her
own
fair
hands
bandaged
all
the
wounded
parts
;
and
as
she
did
so
*NL*
she
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
.
``
All
these
mishaps
have
befallen
thee
,
*NL*
hardhearted
knight
,
for
the
sin
of
thy
insensibility
and
obstinacy
;
and
*NL*
God
grant
thy
squire
Sancho
may
forget
to
whip
himself
,
so
that
that
*NL*
dearly
beloved
Dulcinea
of
thine
may
never
be
released
from
her
*NL*
enchantment
,
that
thou
mayest
never
come
to
her
bed
,
at
least
while
I
who
*NL*
adore
thee
am
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
Don
Quixote
made
no
answer
except
to
heave
deep
sighs
,
and
*NL*
then
stretched
himself
on
his
bed
,
thanking
the
duke
and
duchess
for
*NL*
their
kindness
,
not
because
he
stood
in
any
fear
of
that
bell-ringing
*NL*
rabble
of
enchanters
in
cat
shape
,
but
because
he
recognised
their
good
*NL*
intentions
in
coming
to
his
rescue
.
The
duke
and
duchess
left
him
to
*NL*
repose
and
withdrew
greatly
grieved
at
the
unfortunate
result
of
the
*NL*
joke
;
as
they
never
thought
the
adventure
would
have
fallen
so
heavy
on
*NL*
Don
Quixote
or
cost
him
so
dear
,
for
it
cost
him
five
days
of
confinement
*NL*
to
his
bed
,
during
which
he
had
another
adventure
,
pleasanter
than
the
*NL*
late
one
,
which
his
chronicler
will
not
relate
just
now
in
order
that
he
*NL*
may
turn
his
attention
to
Sancho
Panza
,
who
was
proceeding
with
great
*NL*
diligence
and
drollery
in
his
government

CHAPTER
XLVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
CONTINUED
THE
ACCOUNT
OF
HOW
SANCHO
PANZA
CONDUCTED
HIMSELF
IN
*NL*
HIS
GOVERNMENT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
says
that
from
the
justice
court
they
carried
Sancho
to
a
*NL*
sumptuous
palace
,
where
in
a
spacious
chamber
there
was
a
table
laid
out
*NL*
with
royal
magnificence
.
The
clarions
sounded
as
Sancho
entered
the
room
,
*NL*
and
four
pages
came
forward
to
present
him
with
water
for
his
hands
,
*NL*
which
Sancho
received
with
great
dignity
.
The
music
ceased
,
and
Sancho
*NL*
seated
himself
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
for
there
was
only
that
seat
*NL*
placed
,
and
no
more
than
one
cover
laid
.
A
personage
,
who
it
appeared
*NL*
afterwards
was
a
physician
,
placed
himself
standing
by
his
side
with
a
*NL*
whalebone
wand
in
his
hand
.
They
then
lifted
up
a
fine
white
cloth
*NL*
covering
fruit
and
a
great
variety
of
dishes
of
different
sorts
;
one
who
*NL*
looked
like
a
student
said
grace
,
and
a
page
put
a
laced
bib
on
Sancho
,
*NL*
while
another
who
played
the
part
of
head
carver
placed
a
dish
of
fruit
*NL*
before
him
.
But
hardly
had
he
tasted
a
morsel
when
the
man
with
the
wand
*NL*
touched
the
plate
with
it
,
and
they
took
it
away
from
before
him
with
the
*NL*
utmost
celerity
.
The
carver
,
however
,
brought
him
another
dish
,
and
*NL*
Sancho
proceeded
to
try
it
;
but
before
he
could
get
at
it
,
not
to
say
*NL*
taste
it
,
already
the
wand
had
touched
it
and
a
page
had
carried
it
off
*NL*
with
the
same
promptitude
as
the
fruit
.
Sancho
seeing
this
was
puzzled
,
*NL*
and
looking
from
one
to
another
asked
if
this
dinner
was
to
be
eaten
*NL*
after
the
fashion
of
a
jugglery
trick
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
he
with
the
wand
replied
,
``
It
is
not
to
be
eaten
,
senor
governor
,
*NL*
except
as
is
usual
and
customary
in
other
islands
where
there
are
*NL*
governors
.
I
,
senor
,
am
a
physician
,
and
I
am
paid
a
salary
in
this
*NL*
island
to
serve
its
governors
as
such
,
and
I
have
a
much
greater
regard
*NL*
for
their
health
than
for
my
own
,
studying
day
and
night
and
making
*NL*
myself
acquainted
with
the
governor
's
constitution
,
in
order
to
be
able
*NL*
to
cure
him
when
he
falls
sick
.
The
chief
thing
I
have
to
do
is
to
attend
*NL*
at
his
dinners
and
suppers
and
allow
him
to
eat
what
appears
to
me
to
be
*NL*
fit
for
him
,
and
keep
from
him
what
I
think
will
do
him
harm
and
be
*NL*
injurious
to
his
stomach
;
and
therefore
I
ordered
that
plate
of
fruit
to
*NL*
be
removed
as
being
too
moist
,
and
that
other
dish
I
ordered
to
be
*NL*
removed
as
being
too
hot
and
containing
many
spices
that
stimulate
*NL*
thirst
;
for
he
who
drinks
much
kills
and
consumes
the
radical
moisture
*NL*
wherein
life
consists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
dish
of
roast
partridges
there
that
seems
*NL*
so
savoury
will
not
do
me
any
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
physician
replied
,
``
Of
those
my
lord
the
governor
shall
not
*NL*
eat
so
long
as
I
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
``
our
master
Hippocrates
,
the
polestar
and
*NL*
beacon
of
medicine
,
says
in
one
of
his
aphorisms
omnis
saturatio
mala
,
*NL*
perdicis
autem
pessima
,
which
means
`
all
repletion
is
bad
,
but
that
of
*NL*
partridge
is
the
worst
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
let
senor
doctor
see
among
the
dishes
that
*NL*
are
on
the
table
what
will
do
me
most
good
and
least
harm
,
and
let
me
eat
*NL*
it
,
without
tapping
it
with
his
stick
;
for
by
the
life
of
the
governor
,
*NL*
and
so
may
God
suffer
me
to
enjoy
it
,
but
I
'm
dying
of
hunger
;
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
doctor
and
all
he
may
say
,
to
deny
me
food
is
the
way
to
*NL*
take
my
life
instead
of
prolonging
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
is
right
,
senor
governor
,
''
said
the
physician
;
``
and
*NL*
therefore
your
worship
,
I
consider
,
should
not
eat
of
those
stewed
*NL*
rabbits
there
,
because
it
is
a
furry
kind
of
food
;
if
that
veal
were
not
*NL*
roasted
and
served
with
pickles
,
you
might
try
it
;
but
it
is
out
of
the
*NL*
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
big
dish
that
is
smoking
farther
off
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
seems
to
me
to
*NL*
be
an
olla
podrida
,
and
out
of
the
diversity
of
things
in
such
ollas
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
fail
to
light
upon
something
tasty
and
good
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Absit
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
``
far
from
us
be
any
such
base
thought
!
There
is
*NL*
nothing
in
the
world
less
nourishing
than
an
olla
podrida
;
to
canons
,
or
*NL*
rectors
of
colleges
,
or
peasants
'
weddings
with
your
ollas
podridas
,
but
*NL*
let
us
have
none
of
them
on
the
tables
of
governors
,
where
everything
*NL*
that
is
present
should
be
delicate
and
refined
;
and
the
reason
is
,
that
*NL*
always
,
everywhere
and
by
everybody
,
simple
medicines
are
more
esteemed
*NL*
than
compound
ones
,
for
we
can
not
go
wrong
in
those
that
are
simple
,
*NL*
while
in
the
compound
we
may
,
by
merely
altering
the
quantity
of
the
*NL*
things
composing
them
.
But
what
I
am
of
opinion
the
governor
should
eat
*NL*
now
in
order
to
preserve
and
fortify
his
health
is
a
hundred
or
so
of
*NL*
wafer
cakes
and
a
few
thin
slices
of
conserve
of
quinces
,
which
will
*NL*
settle
his
stomach
and
help
his
digestion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
on
hearing
this
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
surveyed
the
*NL*
doctor
steadily
,
and
in
a
solemn
tone
asked
him
what
his
name
was
and
*NL*
where
he
had
studied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
``
My
name
,
senor
governor
,
is
Doctor
Pedro
Recio
de
Aguero
I
*NL*
am
a
native
of
a
place
called
Tirteafuera
which
lies
between
Caracuel
and
*NL*
Almodovar
del
Campo
,
on
the
right-hand
side
,
and
I
have
the
degree
of
*NL*
doctor
from
the
university
of
Osuna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
,
glowing
all
over
with
rage
,
returned
,
``
Then
let
Doctor
*NL*
Pedro
Recio
de
Malaguero
,
native
of
Tirteafuera
,
a
place
that
's
on
the
*NL*
right-hand
side
as
we
go
from
Caracuel
to
Almodovar
del
Campo
,
graduate
*NL*
of
Osuna
,
get
out
of
my
presence
at
once
;
or
I
swear
by
the
sun
I
'll
take
*NL*
a
cudgel
,
and
by
dint
of
blows
,
beginning
with
him
,
I
'll
not
leave
a
*NL*
doctor
in
the
whole
island
;
at
least
of
those
I
know
to
be
ignorant
;
for
*NL*
as
to
learned
,
wise
,
sensible
physicians
,
them
I
will
reverence
and
*NL*
honour
as
divine
persons
.
Once
more
I
say
let
Pedro
Recio
get
out
of
this
*NL*
or
I
'll
take
this
chair
I
am
sitting
on
and
break
it
over
his
head
.
And
*NL*
if
they
call
me
to
account
for
it
,
I
'll
clear
myself
by
saying
I
served
*NL*
God
in
killing
a
bad
doctor
--
a
general
executioner
.
And
now
give
me
*NL*
something
to
eat
,
or
else
take
your
government
;
for
a
trade
that
does
not
*NL*
feed
its
master
is
not
worth
two
beans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
was
dismayed
when
he
saw
the
governor
in
such
a
passion
,
and
*NL*
he
would
have
made
a
Tirteafuera
out
of
the
room
but
that
the
same
*NL*
instant
a
post-horn
sounded
in
the
street
;
and
the
carver
putting
his
*NL*
head
out
of
the
window
turned
round
and
said
,
``
It
's
a
courier
from
my
*NL*
lord
the
duke
,
no
doubt
with
some
despatch
of
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
courier
came
in
all
sweating
and
flurried
,
and
taking
a
paper
from
*NL*
his
bosom
,
placed
it
in
the
governor
's
hands
.
Sancho
handed
it
to
the
*NL*
majordomo
and
bade
him
read
the
superscription
,
which
ran
thus
:
To
Don
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
,
Governor
of
the
Island
of
Barataria
,
into
his
own
hands
or
*NL*
those
of
his
secretary
.
Sancho
when
he
heard
this
said
,
``
Which
of
you
is
*NL*
my
secretary
?
''
``
I
am
,
senor
,
''
said
one
of
those
present
,
``
for
I
can
read
*NL*
and
write
,
and
am
a
Biscayan
.
''
``
With
that
addition
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
you
*NL*
might
be
secretary
to
the
emperor
himself
;
open
this
paper
and
see
what
*NL*
it
says
.
''
The
new-born
secretary
obeyed
,
and
having
read
the
contents
*NL*
said
the
matter
was
one
to
be
discussed
in
private
.
Sancho
ordered
the
*NL*
chamber
to
be
cleared
,
the
majordomo
and
the
carver
only
remaining
;
so
*NL*
the
doctor
and
the
others
withdrew
,
and
then
the
secretary
read
the
*NL*
letter
,
which
was
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
come
to
my
knowledge
,
Senor
Don
Sancho
Panza
,
that
certain
enemies
*NL*
of
mine
and
of
the
island
are
about
to
make
a
furious
attack
upon
it
some
*NL*
night
,
I
know
not
when
.
It
behoves
you
to
be
on
the
alert
and
keep
watch
,
*NL*
that
they
surprise
you
not
.
I
also
know
by
trustworthy
spies
that
four
*NL*
persons
have
entered
the
town
in
disguise
in
order
to
take
your
life
,
*NL*
because
they
stand
in
dread
of
your
great
capacity
;
keep
your
eyes
open
*NL*
and
take
heed
who
approaches
you
to
address
you
,
and
eat
nothing
that
is
*NL*
presented
to
you
.
I
will
take
care
to
send
you
aid
if
you
find
yourself
*NL*
in
difficulty
,
but
in
all
things
you
will
act
as
may
be
expected
of
your
*NL*
judgment
.
From
this
place
,
the
Sixteenth
of
August
,
at
four
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
friend
,
*NL*
*NL*
THE
DUKE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
astonished
,
and
those
who
stood
by
made
believe
to
be
so
too
,
*NL*
and
turning
to
the
majordomo
he
said
to
him
,
``
What
we
have
got
to
do
*NL*
first
,
and
it
must
be
done
at
once
,
is
to
put
Doctor
Recio
in
the
*NL*
lock-up
;
for
if
anyone
wants
to
kill
me
it
is
he
,
and
by
a
slow
death
and
*NL*
the
worst
of
all
,
which
is
hunger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Likewise
,
''
said
the
carver
,
``
it
is
my
opinion
your
worship
should
not
*NL*
eat
anything
that
is
on
this
table
,
for
the
whole

a
present
from
some
*NL*
nuns
;
and
as
they
say
,
`
behind
the
cross
there
's
the
devil
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
deny
it
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
so
for
the
present
give
me
a
piece
of
*NL*
bread
and
four
pounds
or
so
of
grapes
;
no
poison
can
come
in
them
;
for
*NL*
the
fact
is
I
ca
n't
go
on
without
eating
;
and
if
we
are
to
be
prepared
*NL*
for
these
battles
that
are
threatening
us
we
must
be
well
provisioned
;
*NL*
for
it
is
the
tripes
that
carry
the
heart
and
not
the
heart
the
tripes
.
*NL*
And
you
,
secretary
,
answer
my
lord
the
duke
and
tell
him
that
all
his
*NL*
commands
shall
be
obeyed
to
the
letter
,
as
he
directs
;
and
say
from
me
to
*NL*
my
lady
the
duchess
that
I
kiss
her
hands
,
and
that
I
beg
of
her
not
to
*NL*
forget
to
send
my
letter
and
bundle
to
my
wife
Teresa
Panza
by
a

messenger

I
will
take
it
as
a
great
favour

will
not
fail

serve
her
in
all
that
may
lie
within
my
power

as
you
are
about
it
*NL*
you
may
enclose
a
kiss
of
the
hand
to
my
master
Don
Quixote
that
he
may
*NL*
see
I
am
grateful
bread
;

as
a
good
secretary
and
a
good
Biscayan
you
*NL*
may
add
whatever
you
like
and
whatever
will
come
in
best
;
and
now
take
*NL*
away
this
cloth
and
give
me
something
to
eat
,

I
'll
be
ready
to
meet

all
the
spies

assassins

enchanters
that
may
come
against
me

my

island

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
a
page
entered
saying
,
``
Here
is
a
farmer

business

*NL*

odd

Sancho

possible

can
be
such
fools

that
an

*NL*
either
I

very
little

as
good
as
good
bread

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
,
''
said
the
majordomo
,
``
for
we
are
all
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
be
possible

carver

said
Sancho
,
``
now
that
Doctor
Pedro
Recio
*NL*
is
not
here
,
to
let
me
eat
something
solid
and
substantial
,
if
it
were
*NL*
even
a
piece
of
bread
and
an
onion
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
To-night
at
supper
,

said
the
carver
,
``
the
shortcomings
of
the
dinner
*NL*
shall
be
made
good

and
your
lordship
shall
be
fully
contented

*NL*
``
God
grant
it

said
Sancho

*NL*
*NL*
The
farmer
now
came
in
,
a
well-favoured
man
that
one
might
see
a
thousand
*NL*
leagues
off
was
an
honest
fellow
and
a
good
soul
.
The
first
thing
he
said
*NL*
was
,
``
Which
is
the
lord
governor
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
should
it
be
,
''
said
the
secretary
,
``
but
he
who
is
seated
in
the
*NL*
chair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
humble
myself
before
him
,
''
said
the
farmer
;
and
going
on
his
*NL*
knees
he
asked
for
his
hand
,
to
kiss
it
.
Sancho
refused
it
,
and
bade
him
*NL*
stand
up
and
say
what
he
wanted
.
The
farmer
obeyed
,
and
then
said
,
``
I
am
*NL*
a
farmer
,
senor
,
a
native
of
Miguelturra
,
a
village
two
leagues
from
*NL*
Ciudad
Real
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
Tirteafuera
!
''
said
Sancho
;
``
say
on
,
brother
;
I
know
Miguelturra
*NL*
very
well
I
can
tell
you
,
for
it
's
not
very
far
from
my
own
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
case
is
this
,
senor
,
''
continued
the
farmer
,
``
that
by
God
's
mercy
I
*NL*
am
married
with
the
leave
and
licence
of
the
holy
Roman
Catholic
Church
;
*NL*
I
have
two
sons
,
students
,
and
the
younger
is
studying
to
become
*NL*
bachelor
,
and
the
elder
to
be
licentiate
;
I
am
a
widower
,
for
my
wife
*NL*
died
,
or
more
properly
speaking
,
a
bad
doctor
killed
her
on
my
hands
,
*NL*
giving
her
a
purge
when
she
was
with
child
;
and
if
it
had
pleased
God
*NL*
that
the
child
had
been
born
,
and
was
a
boy
,
I
would
have
put
him
to
*NL*
study
for
doctor

that
he
might
not
envy
his
brothers

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
if

you
would
not

be
a
widower

Sancho

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
senor

certainly
not

said
the
farmer

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
got
that
much
settled
,

said
Sancho
;
``
get
on
,
brother
,
for
it
's
*NL*
more
bed-time
than
business-time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
the
farmer
,
``
this
son
of
mine
who
is
going
to
be
a
*NL*
bachelor
,
fell
in
love
in
the
said
town
with
a
damsel
called
Clara
*NL*
Perlerina
,
daughter
of
Andres
Perlerino
,
a
very
rich
farmer
;
and
this
*NL*
name
of
Perlerines
does
not
come
to
them
by
ancestry
or
descent
,
but
*NL*
because
all
the
family
are
paralytics
,
and
for
a
better
name
they
call
*NL*
them
Perlerines
;
though
to
tell
the
truth
the
damsel
is
as
fair
as
an
*NL*
Oriental
pearl
,
and
like
a
flower
of
the
field
,
if
you
look
at
her
on
the
*NL*
right
side
;
on
the
left
not
so
much
,
for
on
that
side
she
wants
an
eye
*NL*
that
she
lost
by
small-pox
;
and
though
her
face
is
thickly
and
deeply
*NL*
pitted
,
those
who
love
her
say
they
are
not
pits
that
are
there
,
but
the
*NL*
graves
where
the
hearts
of
her
lovers
are
buried
.
She
is
so
cleanly
that
*NL*
not
to
soil
her
face
she
carries
her
nose
turned
up
,
as
they
say
,
so
that
*NL*
one
would
fancy
it
was
running
away
from
her
mouth
;
and
with
all
this
she
*NL*
looks
extremely
well
,
for
she
has
a
wide
mouth
;
and
but
for
wanting
ten
*NL*
or
a
dozen
teeth
and
grinders
she
might
compare
and
compete
with
the
*NL*
comeliest
.
Of
her
lips
I
say
nothing
,
for
they
are
so
fine
and
thin
that
,
*NL*
if
lips
might
be
reeled
,
one
might
make
a
skein
of
them
;
but
being
of
a
*NL*
different
colour
from
ordinary
lips
they
are
wonderful
,
for
they
are
*NL*
mottled
,
blue
,
green
,
and
purple
--
let
my
lord
the
governor
pardon
me
for
*NL*
painting
so
minutely
the
charms
of
her
who
some
time
or
other
will
be
my
*NL*
daughter
;
for
I
love
her
,
and
I
do
n't
find
her
amiss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paint
what
you
will
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
enjoy
your
painting
,
and
if
I
had
*NL*
dined
there
could
be
no
dessert
more
to
my
taste
than
your
portrait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
have
still
to
furnish
,

said
the
farmer
;
``
but
a
time
will
come
*NL*
when
we
may
be
able
if
we
are
not
now
;
and
I
can
tell
you
,
senor
,
if
I
*NL*
could
paint
her
gracefulness
and
her
tall
figure
,
it
would
astonish
you
;
*NL*
but
that
is
impossible
because
she
is
bent
double
with
her
knees
up
to
*NL*
her
mouth
;
but
for
all
that
it
is
easy
to
see
that
if
she
could
stand
up
*NL*
she
'd
knock
her
head
against
the
ceiling
;
and
she
would
have
given
her

hand
to
my
bachelor
ere
this
,
only
that
she
ca
n't
stretch
it
out
,
for
*NL*
it
's
contracted
;

still
one
can
see
its
elegance

fine
make
by
its
*NL*
long
furrowed
nails

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,

said
Sancho

consider
you
have
painted
her
from

head

what
is
it

Come
to

point
without

beating

*NL*
``
I

said
the

from

he
has
his

puckered
up

watery

the

The
moment

said
this
the
governor
started
to
his
feet

and
seizing
the
*NL*
chair
he
had
been
sitting
on
exclaimed
,
``
By

at

How

What

not

The
carver
made
signs
to
the
farmer
to
leave
the
room
,
which
he
did
with
*NL*
his
head
down
,
and
to
all
appearance
in
terror
lest
the
governor
should
*NL*
carry
his

doctored

wounds

*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
BEFELL
DON
QUIXOTE
WITH
DONA
RODRIGUEZ
,
THE
DUCHESS

DUENNA
,
*NL*
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
OCCURRENCES
WORTHY

ETERNAL
REMEMBRANCE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Exceedingly
moody
and
dejected
was
the
sorely
wounded
Don
Quixote
,
with
*NL*
his
face
bandaged
and
marked
,
not
by
the
hand
of
God
,
but
by
the
claws
of
*NL*
a
cat
,
mishaps
incidental
to
knight-errantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
days
he
remained
without
appearing
in
public
,
and
one
night
as
he
lay
*NL*
awake
thinking
of
his
misfortunes
and
of
Altisidora
's
pursuit
of
him
,
he
*NL*
perceived
that
some
one
was
opening
the
door
of
his
room
with
a
key
,
and
*NL*
he
at
once
made
up
his
mind
that
the
enamoured
damsel
was
coming
to
make
*NL*
an
assault
upon
his
chastity
and
put
him
in
danger
of
failing
in
the
*NL*
fidelity
he
owed
to
his
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
.
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
firmly
*NL*
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
his
idea
-LRB-
and
he
said
it
loud
enough
to
be
*NL*
heard
-RRB-
,
``
the
greatest
beauty
upon
earth
shall
not
avail
to
make
me
*NL*
renounce
my
adoration
of
her
whom
I
bear
stamped
and
graved
in
the
core
*NL*
of
my
heart
and
the
secret
depths
of
my
bowels
;
be
thou
,
lady
mine
,
*NL*
transformed
into
a
clumsy
country
wench
,
or
into
a
nymph
of
golden
Tagus
*NL*
weaving
a
web
of
silk
and
gold
,
let
Merlin
or
Montesinos
hold
thee
*NL*
captive
where
they
will
;
whereer
thou
art
,
thou
art
mine
,
and
where'er
I
*NL*
am
,
must
be
thine
.
''
The
very
instant
he
had
uttered
these
words
,
the
door
*NL*
opened
.
He
stood
up
on
the
bed
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
a
yellow
*NL*
satin
coverlet
,
with
a
cap
on
his
head
,
and
his
face
and
his
moustaches
*NL*
tied
up
,
his
face
because
of
the
scratches
,
and
his
moustaches
to
keep
*NL*
them
from
drooping
and
falling
down
,
in
which
trim
he
looked
the
most
*NL*
extraordinary
scarecrow
that
could
be
conceived
.
He
kept
his
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
the
door
,
and
just
as
he
was
expecting
to
see
the
love-smitten
and
*NL*
unhappy
Altisidora
make
her
appearance
,
he
saw
coming
in
a
most
venerable
*NL*
duenna
,
in
a
long
white-bordered
veil
that
covered
and
enveloped
her
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
.
Between
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
she
held
a
short
*NL*
lighted
candle
,
while
with
her
right
she
shaded
it
to
keep
the
light
from
*NL*
her
eyes
,
which
were
covered
by
spectacles
of
great
size
,
and
she
*NL*
advanced
with
noiseless
steps
,
treading
very
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
kept
an
eye
upon
her
from
his
watchtower
,
and
observing
her
*NL*
costume
and
noting
her
silence
,
he
concluded
that
it
must
be
some
witch
*NL*
or
sorceress
that
was
coming
in
such
a
guise
to
work
him
some
mischief
,
*NL*
and
he
began
crossing
himself
at
a
great
rate
.
The
spectre
still
*NL*
advanced
,
and
on
reaching
the
middle
of
the
room
,
looked
up
and
saw
the
*NL*
energy
with
which
Don
Quixote
was
crossing
himself
;
and
if
he
was
scared
*NL*
by
seeing
such
a
figure
as
hers
,
she
was
terrified
at
the
sight
of
his
;
*NL*
for
the
moment
she
saw
his
tall
yellow
form
with
the
coverlet
and
the
*NL*
bandages
that
disfigured
him
,
she
gave
a
loud
scream
,
and
exclaiming
,
*NL*
``
Jesus
!
what
's
this
I
see
?
''
let
fall
the
candle
in
her
fright
,
and
then
*NL*
finding
herself
in
the
dark
,
turned
about
to
make
off
,
but
stumbling
on
*NL*
her
skirts
in
her
consternation
,
she
measured
her
length
with
a
mighty
*NL*
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
in
his
trepidation
began
saying
,
``
I
conjure
thee
,
phantom
,
or
*NL*
whatever
thou
art
,
tell
me
what
thou
art
and
what
thou
wouldst
with
me
.
*NL*
If
thou
art
a
soul
in
torment
,
say
so
,
and
all
that
my
powers
can
do
I
*NL*
will
do
for
thee
;
for
I
am
a
Catholic
Christian
and
love
to
do
good
to
*NL*
all
the
world
,
and
to
this
end
I
have
embraced
the
order
of
*NL*
knight-errantry
to
which
I
belong
,
the
province
of
which
extends
to
doing
*NL*
good
even
to
souls
in
purgatory
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
unfortunate
duenna
hearing
herself
thus
conjured
,
by
her
own
fear
*NL*
guessed
Don
Quixote
's
and
in
a
low
plaintive
voice
answered
,
``
Senor
Don
*NL*
Quixote
--
if
so
be
you
are
indeed
Don
Quixote
--
I
am
no
phantom
or
spectre
*NL*
or
soul
in
purgatory
,
as
you
seem
to
think
,
but
Dona
Rodriguez
,
duenna
of
*NL*
honour
to
my
lady
the
duchess
,
and
I
come
to
you
with
one
of
those
*NL*
grievances
your
worship
is
wont
to
redress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
Senora
Dona
Rodriguez
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
do
you
perchance
*NL*
come
to
transact
any
go-between
business
?
Because
I
must
tell
you
I
am
*NL*
not
available
for
anybody
's
purpose
,
thanks
to
the
peerless
beauty
of
my
*NL*
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
.
In
short
,
Senora
Dona
Rodriguez
,
if
you
will
*NL*
leave
out
and
put
aside
all
love
messages
,
you
may
go
and
light
your
*NL*
candle
and
come
back
,
and
we
will
discuss
all
the
commands
you
have
for
*NL*
me
and
whatever
you
wish
,
saving
only
,
as
I
said
,
all
seductive
*NL*
communications
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
carry
nobody
's
messages
,
senor
,
''
said
the
duenna
;
``
little
you
know
me
.
*NL*
Nay
,
I
'm
not
far
enough
advanced
in
years
to
take
to
any
such
childish
*NL*
tricks
.
God
be
praised
I
have
a
soul
in
my
body
still
,
and
all
my
teeth
*NL*
and
grinders
in
my
mouth
,
except
one
or
two
that
the
colds
,
so
common
in
*NL*
this
Aragon
country
,
have
robbed
me
of
.
But
wait
a
little
,
while
I
go
and
*NL*
light
my
candle
,
and
I
will
return
immediately
and
lay
my
sorrows
before
*NL*
you
as
before
one
who
relieves
those
of
all
the
world
;
''
and
without
*NL*
staying
for
an
answer
she
quitted
the
room
and
left
Don
Quixote
*NL*
tranquilly
meditating
while
he
waited
for
her
.
A
thousand
thoughts
at
*NL*
once
suggested
themselves
to
him
on
the
subject
of
this
new
adventure
,
*NL*
and
it
struck
him
as
being
ill
done
and
worse
advised
in
him
to
expose
*NL*
himself
to
the
danger
of
breaking
his
plighted
faith
to
his
lady
;
and
*NL*
said
he
to
himself
,
``
Who
knows
but
that
the
devil
,
being
wily
and
*NL*
cunning
,
may
be
trying
now
to
entrap
me
with
a
duenna
,
having
failed
with
*NL*
empresses
,
queens
,
duchesses
,
marchionesses
,
and
countesses
?
Many
a
time
*NL*
have
I
heard
it
said
by
many
a
man
of
sense
that
he
will
sooner
offer
you
*NL*
a
flat-nosed
wench
than
a
roman-nosed
one
;
and
who
knows
but
this
*NL*
privacy
,
this
opportunity
,
this
silence
,
may
awaken
my
sleeping
desires
,
*NL*
and
lead
me
in
these
my
latter
years
to
fall
where
I
have
never
tripped
?
*NL*
In
cases
of
this
sort
it
is
better
to
flee
than
to
await
the
battle
.
But
*NL*
I
must
be
out
of
my
senses
to
think
and
utter
such
nonsense
;
for
it
is
*NL*
impossible
that
a
long
,
white-hooded
spectacled
duenna
could
stir
up
or
*NL*
excite
a
wanton
thought
in
the
most
graceless
bosom
in
the
world
.
Is
*NL*
there
a
duenna
on
earth
that
has
fair
flesh
?
Is
there
a
duenna
in
the
*NL*
world
that
escapes
being
ill-tempered
,
wrinkled
,
and
prudish
?
Avaunt
,
*NL*
then
,
ye
duenna
crew
,
undelightful
to
all
mankind
.
Oh
,
but
that
lady
did
*NL*
well
who
,
they
say
,
had
at
the
end
of
her
reception
room
a
couple
of
*NL*
figures
of
duennas
with
spectacles
and
lace-cushions
,
as
if
at
work
,
and
*NL*
those
statues
served
quite
as
well
to
give
an
air
of
propriety
to
the
*NL*
room
as
if
they
had
been
real
duennas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
he
leaped
off
the
bed
,
intending
to
close
the
door
and
not
*NL*
allow
Senora
Rodriguez
to
enter
;
but
as
he
went
to
shut
it
Senora
*NL*
Rodriguez
returned
with
a
wax
candle
lighted
,
and
having
a
closer
view
of
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
with
the
coverlet
round
him
,
and
his
bandages
and
night-cap
,
*NL*
she
was
alarmed
afresh
,
and
retreating
a
couple
of
paces
,
exclaimed
,
``
Am
*NL*
I
safe
,
sir
knight
?
for
I
do
n't
look
upon
it
as
a
sign
of
very
great
*NL*
virtue
that
your
worship
should
have
got
up
out
of
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
well
ask
the
same
,
senora
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
I
do
ask
*NL*
whether
I
shall
be
safe
from
being
assailed
and
forced
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
whom
and
against
whom
do
you
demand
that
security
,
sir
knight
?
''
said
*NL*
the
duenna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
you
and
against
you
I
ask
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
I
am
not
*NL*
marble
,
nor
are
you
brass
,
nor
is
it
now
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
but
*NL*
midnight
,
or
a
trifle
past
it
I
fancy
,
and
we
are
in
a
room
more
secluded
*NL*
and
retired
than
the
cave
could
have
been
where
the
treacherous
and
*NL*
daring
AEneas
enjoyed
the
fair
soft-hearted
Dido
.
But
give
me
your
hand
,
*NL*
senora
;
I
require
no
better
protection
than
my
own
continence
,
and
my
own
*NL*
sense
of
propriety
;
as
well
as
that
which
is
inspired
by
that
venerable
*NL*
head-dress
;
''
and
so
saying
he
kissed
her
right
hand
and
took
it
in
his
*NL*
own
,
she
yielding
it
to
him
with
equal
ceremoniousness
.
And
here
Cide
*NL*
Hamete
inserts
a
parenthesis
in
which
he
says
that
to
have
seen
the
pair
*NL*
marching
from
the
door
to
the
bed
,
linked
hand
in
hand
in
this
way
,
he
*NL*
would
have
given
the
best
of
the
two
tunics
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
finally
got
into
bed
,
and
Dona
Rodriguez
took
her
seat
on
a
*NL*
chair
at
some
little
distance
from
his
couch
,
without
taking
off
her
*NL*
spectacles
or
putting
aside
the
candle
.
Don
Quixote
wrapped
the
*NL*
bedclothes
round
him
and
covered
himself
up
completely
,
leaving
nothing
*NL*
but
his
face
visible
,
and
as
soon
as
they
had
both
regained
their
*NL*
composure
he
broke
silence
,
saying
,
``
Now
,
Senora
Dona
Rodriguez
,
you
may
*NL*
unbosom
yourself
and
out
with
everything
you
have
in
your
sorrowful
heart
*NL*
and
afflicted
bowels
;
and
by
me
you
shall
be
listened
to
with
chaste
*NL*
ears
,
and
aided
by
compassionate
exertions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
,
''
replied
the
duenna
;
``
from
your
worship
's
gentle
and
*NL*
winning
presence
only
such
a
Christian
answer
could
be
expected
.
The
fact
*NL*
is
,
then
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
that
though
you
see
me
seated
in
this
chair
,
*NL*
here
in
the
middle
of
the
kingdom
of
Aragon
,
and
in
the
attire
of
a
*NL*
despised
outcast
duenna
,
I
am
from
the
Asturias
of
Oviedo
,
and
of
a
*NL*
family
with
which
many
of
the
best
of
the
province
are
connected
by
*NL*
blood
;
but
my
untoward
fate
and
the
improvidence
of
my
parents
,
who
,
I
*NL*
know
not
how
,
were
unseasonably
reduced
to
poverty
,
brought
me
to
the
*NL*
court
of
Madrid
,
where
as
a
provision
and
to
avoid
greater
misfortunes
,
*NL*
my
parents
placed
me
as
seamstress
in
the
service
of
a
lady
of
quality
,
*NL*
and
I
would
have
you
know
that
for
hemming
and
sewing
I
have
never
been
*NL*
surpassed
by
any
all
my
life
.
My
parents
left
me
in
service
and
returned
*NL*
to
their
own
country
,
and
a
few
years
later
went
,
no
doubt
,
to
heaven
,
*NL*
for
they
were
excellent
good
Catholic
Christians
.
I
was
left
an
orphan
*NL*
with
nothing
but
the
miserable
wages
and
trifling
presents
that
are
given
*NL*
to
servants
of
my
sort
in
palaces
;
but
about
this
time
,
without
any
*NL*
encouragement
on
my
part
,
one
of
the
esquires
of
the
household
fell
in
*NL*
love
with
me
,
a
man
somewhat
advanced
in
years
,
full-bearded
and
*NL*
personable
,
and
above
all
as
good
a
gentleman
as
the
king
himself
,
for
he
*NL*
came
of
a
mountain
stock
.
We
did
not
carry
on
our
loves
with
such
secrecy
*NL*
but
that
they
came
to
the
knowledge
of
my
lady
,
and
she
,
not
to
have
any
*NL*
fuss
about
it
,
had
us
married
with
the
full
sanction
of
the
holy
mother
*NL*
Roman
Catholic
Church
,
of
which
marriage
a
daughter
was
born
to
put
an
*NL*
end
to
my
good
fortune
,
if
I
had
any
;
not
that
I
died
in
childbirth
,
for
*NL*
I
passed
through
it
safely
and
in
due
season
,
but
because
shortly
*NL*
afterwards
my
husband
died
of
a
certain
shock
he
received
,
and
had
I
time
*NL*
to
tell
you
of
it
I
know
your
worship
would
be
surprised
;
''
and
here
she
*NL*
began
to
weep
bitterly
and
said
,
``
Pardon
me
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
if
I
am
*NL*
unable
to
control
myself
,
for
every
time
I
think
of
my
unfortunate
*NL*
husband
my
eyes
fill
up
with
tears
.
God
bless
me
,
with
what
an
air
of
*NL*
dignity
he
used
to
carry
my
lady
behind
him
on
a
stout
mule
as
black
as
*NL*
jet
!
for
in
those
days
they
did
not
use
coaches
or
chairs
,
as
they
say
*NL*
they
do
now
,
and
ladies
rode
behind
their
squires
.
This
much
at
least
I
*NL*
can
not
help
telling
you
,
that
you
may
observe
the
good
breeding
and
*NL*
punctiliousness
of
my
worthy
husband
.
As
he
was
turning
into
the
Calle
de
*NL*
Santiago
in
Madrid
,
which
is
rather
narrow
,
one
of
the
alcaldes
of
the
*NL*
Court
,
with
two
alguacils
before
him
,
was
coming
out
of
it
,
and
as
soon
*NL*
as
my
good
squire
saw
him
he
wheeled
his
mule
about
and
made
as
if
he
*NL*
would
turn
and
accompany
him
.
My
lady
,
who
was
riding
behind
him
,
said
to
*NL*
him
in
a
low
voice
,
`
What
are
you
about
,
you
sneak
,
do
n't
you
see
that
I
*NL*
am
here
?
'
The
alcalde
like
a
polite
man
pulled
up
his
horse
and
said
to
*NL*
him
,
`
Proceed
,
senor
,
for
it
is
I
,
rather
,
who
ought
to
accompany
my
lady
*NL*
Dona
Casilda
'
--
for
that
was
my
mistress
's
name
.
Still
my
husband
,
cap
in
*NL*
hand
,
persisted
in
trying
to
accompany
the
alcalde
,
and
seeing
this
my
*NL*
lady
,
filled
with
rage
and
vexation
,
pulled
out
a
big
pin
,
or
,
I
rather
*NL*
think
,
a
bodkin
,
out
of
her
needle-case
and
drove
it
into
his
back
with
*NL*
such
force
that
my
husband
gave
a
loud
yell
,
and
writhing
fell
to
the
*NL*
ground
with
his
lady
.
Her
two
lacqueys
ran
to
rise
her
up
,
and
the
*NL*
alcalde
and
the
alguacils
did
the
same
;
the
Guadalajara
gate
was
all
in
*NL*
commotion
--
I
mean
the
idlers
congregated
there
;
my
mistress
came
back
on
*NL*
foot
,
and
my
husband
hurried
away
to
a
barber
's
shop
protesting
that
he
*NL*
was
run
right
through
the
guts
.
The
courtesy
of
my
husband
was
noised
*NL*
abroad
to
such
an
extent
,
that
the
boys
gave
him
no
peace
in
the
street
;
*NL*
and
on
this
account
,
and
because
he
was
somewhat
shortsighted
,
my
lady
*NL*
dismissed
him
;
and
it
was
chagrin
at
this
I
am
convinced
beyond
a
doubt
*NL*
that
brought
on
his
death
.
I
was
left
a
helpless
widow
,
with
a
daughter
*NL*
on
my
hands
growing
up
in
beauty
like
the
sea-foam
;
at
length
,
however
,
*NL*
as
I
had
the
character
of
being
an
excellent
needlewoman
,
my
lady
the
*NL*
duchess
,
then
lately
married
to
my
lord
the
duke
,
offered
to
take
me
with
*NL*
her
to
this
kingdom
of
Aragon
,
and
my
daughter
also
,
and
here
as
time
*NL*
went
by
my
daughter
grew
up
and
with
her
all
the
graces
in
the
world
;
she
*NL*
sings
like
a
lark
,
dances
quick
as
thought
,
foots
it
like
a
gipsy
,
reads
*NL*
and
writes
like
a
schoolmaster
,
and
does
sums
like
a
miser
;
of
her
*NL*
neatness
I
say
nothing
,
for
the
running
water
is
not
purer
,
and
her
age
*NL*
is
now
,
if
my
memory
serves
me
,
sixteen
years
five
months
and
three
days
,
*NL*
one
more
or
less
.
To
come
to
the
point
,
the
son
of
a
very
rich
farmer
,
*NL*
living
in
a
village
of
my
lord
the
duke
's
not
very
far
from
here
,
fell
in
*NL*
love
with
this
girl
of
mine
;
and
in
short
,
how
I
know
not
,
they
came
*NL*
together
,
and
under
the
promise
of
marrying
her
he
made
a
fool
of
my
*NL*
daughter
,
and
will
not
keep
his
word
.
And
though
my
lord
the
duke
is
*NL*
aware
of
it
-LRB-
for
I
have
complained
to
him
,
not
once
but
many
and
many
a
*NL*
time
,
and
entreated
him
to
order
the
farmer
to
marry
my
daughter
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
turns
a
deaf
ear
and
will
scarcely
listen
to
me
;
the
reason
being
that
as
*NL*
the
deceiver
's
father
is
so
rich
,
and
lends
him
money
,
and
is
constantly
*NL*
going
security
for
his
debts
,
he
does
not
like
to
offend
or
annoy
him
in
*NL*
any
way
.
Now
,
senor
,
I
want
your
worship
to
take
it
upon
yourself
to
*NL*
redress
this
wrong
either
by
entreaty
or
by
arms
;
for
by
what
all
the
*NL*
world
says
you
came
into
it
to
redress
grievances
and
right
wrongs
and
*NL*
help
the
unfortunate
.
Let
your
worship
put
before
you
the
unprotected
*NL*
condition
of
my
daughter
,
her
youth
,
and
all
the
perfections
I
have
said
*NL*
she
possesses
;
and
before
God
and
on
my
conscience
,
out
of
all
the
*NL*
damsels
my
lady
has
,
there
is
not
one
that
comes
up
to
the
sole
of
her
*NL*
shoe
,
and
the
one
they
call
Altisidora
,
and
look
upon
as
the
boldest
and
*NL*
gayest
of
them
,
put
in
comparison
with
my
daughter
,
does
not
come
within
*NL*
two
leagues
of
her
.
For
I
would
have
you
know
,
senor
,
all
is
not
gold
*NL*
that
glitters
,
and
that
same
little
Altisidora
has
more
forwardness
than
*NL*
good
looks
,
and
more
impudence
than
modesty
;
besides
being
not
very
*NL*
sound
,
for
she
has
such
a
disagreeable
breath
that
one
can
not
bear
to
be
*NL*
near
her
for
a
moment
;
and
even
my
lady
the
duchess
--
but
I
'll
hold
my
*NL*
tongue
,
for
they
say
that
walls
have
ears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
heaven
's
sake
,
Dona
Rodriguez
,
what
ails
my
lady
the
duchess
?
''
asked
*NL*
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adjured
in
that
way
,
''
replied
the
duenna
,
``
I
can
not
help
answering
the
*NL*
question
and
telling
the
whole
truth
.
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
have
you
*NL*
observed
the
comeliness
of
my
lady
the
duchess
,
that
smooth
complexion
of
*NL*
hers
like
a
burnished
polished
sword
,
those
two
cheeks
of
milk
and
*NL*
carmine
,
that
gay
lively
step
with
which
she
treads
or
rather
seems
to
*NL*
spurn
the
earth
,
so
that
one
would
fancy
she
went
radiating
health
*NL*
wherever
she
passed
?
Well
then
,
let
me
tell
you
she
may
thank
,
first
of
*NL*
all
God
,
for
this
,
and
next
,
two
issues
that
she
has
,
one
in
each
leg
,
by
*NL*
which
all
the
evil
humours
,
of
which
the
doctors
say
she
is
full
,
are
*NL*
discharged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessed
Virgin
!
''
exclaimed
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
is
it
possible
that
my
lady
*NL*
the
duchess
has
drains
of
that
sort
?
I
would
not
have
believed
it
if
the
*NL*
barefoot
friars
had
told
it
me
;
but
as
the
lady
Dona
Rodriguez
says
so
,
*NL*
it
must
be
so
.
But
surely
such
issues
,
and
in
such
places
,
do
not
*NL*
discharge
humours
,
but
liquid
amber
.
Verily
,
I
do
believe
now
that
this
*NL*
practice
of
opening
issues
is
a
very
important
matter
for
the
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
had
hardly
said
this
,
when
the
chamber
door
flew
open
with
a
*NL*
loud
bang
,
and
with
the
start
the
noise
gave
her
Dona
Rodriguez
let
the
*NL*
candle
fall
from
her
hand
,
and
the
room
was
left
as
dark
as
a
wolf
's
*NL*
mouth
,
as
the
saying
is
.
Suddenly
the
poor
duenna
felt
two
hands
seize
*NL*
her
by
the
throat
,
so
tightly
that
she
could
not
croak
,
while
some
one
*NL*
else
,
without
uttering
a
word
,
very
briskly
hoisted
up
her
petticoats
,
*NL*
and
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
slipper
began
to
lay
on
so
heartily
that
*NL*
anyone
would
have
felt
pity
for
her
;
but
although
Don
Quixote
felt
it
he
*NL*
never
stirred
from
his
bed
,
but
lay
quiet
and
silent
,
nay
apprehensive
*NL*
that
his
turn
for
a
drubbing
might
be
coming
.
Nor
was
the
apprehension
an
*NL*
idle
one
;
for
leaving
the
duenna
-LRB-
who
did
not
dare
to
cry
out
-RRB-
well
*NL*
basted
,
the
silent
executioners
fell
upon
Don
Quixote
,
and
stripping
him
*NL*
of
the
sheet
and
the
coverlet
,
they
pinched
him
so
fast
and
so
hard
that
*NL*
he
was
driven
to
defend
himself
with
his
fists
,
and
all
this
in
*NL*
marvellous
silence
.
The
battle
lasted
nearly
half
an
hour
,
and
then
the
*NL*
phantoms
fled
;
Dona
Rodriguez
gathered
up
her
skirts
,
and
bemoaning
her
*NL*
fate
went
out
without
saying
a
word
to
Don
Quixote
,
and
he
,
sorely
*NL*
pinched
,
puzzled
,
and
dejected
,
remained
alone
,
and
there
we
will
leave
*NL*
him
,
wondering
who
could
have
been
the
perverse
enchanter
who
had
reduced
*NL*
him
to
such
a
state
;
but
that
shall
be
told
in
due
season
,
for
Sancho
*NL*
claims
our
attention
,
and
the
methodical
arrangement
of
the
story
demands
*NL*
it

CHAPTER
XLIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
SANCHO
IN
MAKING
THE
ROUND
OF
HIS
ISLAND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
the
great
governor
angered
and
irritated
by
that
*NL*
portrait-painting
rogue
of
a
farmer
who
,
instructed
the
majordomo
,
as
the
*NL*
majordomo
was
by
the
duke
,
tried
to
practise
upon
him
;
he
however
,
fool
,
*NL*
boor
,
and
clown
as
he
was
,
held
his
own
against
them
all
,
saying
to
those
*NL*
round
him
and
to
Doctor
Pedro
Recio
,
who
as
soon
as
the
private
business
*NL*
of
the
duke
's
letter
was
disposed
of
had
returned
to
the
room
,
``
Now
I
see
*NL*
plainly
enough
that
judges
and
governors
ought
to
be
and
must
be
made
of
*NL*
brass
not
to
feel
the
importunities
of
the
applicants
that
at
all
times
*NL*
and
all
seasons
insist
on
being
heard
,
and
having
their
business
*NL*
despatched
,
and
their
own
affairs
and
no
others
attended
to
,
come
what
*NL*
may
;
and
if
the
poor
judge
does
not
hear
them
and
settle
the
*NL*
matter
--
either
because
he
can
not
or
because
that
is
not
the
time
set
*NL*
apart
for
hearing
them-forthwith
they
abuse
him
,
and
run
him
down
,
and
*NL*
gnaw
at
his
bones
,
and
even
pick
holes
in
his
pedigree
.
You
silly
,
stupid
*NL*
applicant
,
do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
;
wait
for
the
proper
time
and
season
for
*NL*
doing
business
;
do
n't
come
at
dinner-hour
,
or
at
bed-time
;
for
judges
are
*NL*
only
flesh
and
blood
,
and
must
give
to
Nature
what
she
naturally
demands
*NL*
of
them
;
all
except
myself
,
for
in
my
case
I
give
her
nothing
to
eat
,
*NL*
thanks
to
Senor
Doctor
Pedro
Recio
Tirteafuera
here
,
who
would
have
me
*NL*
die
of
hunger
,
and
declares
that
death
to
be
life
;
and
the
same
sort
of
*NL*
life
may
God
give
him
and
all
his
kind
--
I
mean
the
bad
doctors
;
for
the
*NL*
good
ones
deserve
palms
and
laurels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
who
knew
Sancho
Panza
were
astonished
to
hear
him
speak
so
elegantly
,
*NL*
and
did
not
know
what
to
attribute
it
to
unless
it
were
that
office
and
*NL*
grave
responsibility
either
smarten
or
stupefy
men
's
wits
.
At
last
Doctor
*NL*
Pedro
Recio
Agilers
of
Tirteafuera
promised
to
let
him
have
supper
that
*NL*
night
though
it
might
be
in
contravention
of
all
the
aphorisms
of
*NL*
Hippocrates
.
With
this
the
governor
was
satisfied
and
looked
forward
to
*NL*
the
approach
of
night
and
supper-time
with
great
anxiety
;
and
though
*NL*
time
,
to
his
mind
,
stood
still
and
made
no
progress
,
nevertheless
the
*NL*
hour
he
so
longed
for
came
,
and
they
gave
him
a
beef
salad
with
onions
*NL*
and
some
boiled
calves
'
feet
rather
far
gone
.
At
this
he
fell
to
with
*NL*
greater
relish
than
if
they
had
given
him
francolins
from
Milan
,
*NL*
pheasants
from
Rome
,
veal
from
Sorrento
,
partridges
from
Moron
,
or
geese
*NL*
from
Lavajos
,
and
turning
to
the
doctor
at
supper
he
said
to
him
,
``
Look
*NL*
here
,
senor
doctor
,
for
the
future
do
n't
trouble
yourself
about
giving
me
*NL*
dainty
things
or
choice
dishes
to
eat
,
for
it
will
be
only
taking
my
*NL*
stomach
off
its
hinges
;
it
is
accustomed
to
goat
,
cow
,
bacon
,
hung
beef
,
*NL*
turnips
and
onions
;
and
if
by
any
chance
it
is
given
these
palace
dishes
,
*NL*
it
receives
them
squeamishly
,
and
sometimes
with
loathing
.
What
the
*NL*
head-carver
had
best
do
is
to
serve
me
with
what
they
call
ollas
podridas
*NL*
-LRB-
and
the
rottener
they
are
the
better
they
smell
-RRB-
;
and
he
can
put
*NL*
whatever
he
likes
into
them
,
so
long
as
it
is
good
to
eat
,
and
I
'll
be
*NL*
obliged
to
him
,
and
will
requite
him
some
day
.
But
let
nobody
play
pranks
*NL*
on
me
,
for
either
we
are
or
we
are
not
;
let
us
live
and
eat
in
peace
and
*NL*
good-fellowship
,
for
when
God
sends
the
dawn
,
he
sends
it
for
all
.
I
mean
*NL*
to
govern
this
island
without
giving
up
a
right
or
taking
a
bribe
;
let
*NL*
everyone
keep
his
eye
open
,
and
look
out
for
the
arrow
;
for
I
can
tell
*NL*
them
`
the
devil
's
in
Cantillana
,
'
and
if
they
drive
me
to
it
they
'll
see
*NL*
something
that
will
astonish
them
.
Nay
!
make
yourself
honey
and
the
flies
*NL*
eat
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
a
truth
,
senor
governor
,
''
said
the
carver
,
``
your
worship
is
in
the
*NL*
right
of
it
in
everything
you
have
said
;
and
I
promise
you
in
the
name
of
*NL*
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
island
that
they
will
serve
your
worship
with
*NL*
all
zeal
,
affection
,
and
good-will
,
for
the
mild
kind
of
government
you
*NL*
have
given
a
sample
of
to
begin
with
,
leaves
them
no
ground
for
doing
or
*NL*
thinking
anything
to
your
worship
's
disadvantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
believe
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
they
would
be
great
fools
if
they
did
*NL*
or
thought
otherwise
;
once
more
I
say
,
see
to
my
feeding
and
my
Dapple
's
*NL*
for
that
is
the
great
point
and
what
is
most
to
the
purpose
;
and
when
the
*NL*
hour
comes
let
us
go
the
rounds
,
for
it
is
my
intention
to
purge
this
*NL*
island
of
all
manner
of
uncleanness
and
of
all
idle
good-for-nothing
*NL*
vagabonds
;
for
I
would
have
you
know
that
lazy
idlers
are
the
same
thing
*NL*
in
a
State
as
the
drones
in
a
hive
,
that
eat
up
the
honey
the
industrious
*NL*
bees
make
.
I
mean
to
protect
the
husbandman
,
to
preserve
to
the
gentleman
*NL*
his
privileges
,
to
reward
the
virtuous
,
and
above
all
to
respect
religion
*NL*
and
honour
its
ministers
.
What
say
you
to
that
,
my
friends
?
Is
there
*NL*
anything
in
what
I
say
,
or
am
I
talking
to
no
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
so
much
in
what
your
worship
says
,
senor
governor
,
''
said
the
*NL*
majordomo
,
``
that
I
am
filled
with
wonder
when
I
see
a
man
like
your
*NL*
worship
,
entirely
without
learning
-LRB-
for
I
believe
you
have
none
at
all
-RRB-
,
*NL*
say
such
things
,
and
so
full
of
sound
maxims
and
sage
remarks
,
very
*NL*
different
from
what
was
expected
of
your
worship
's
intelligence
by
those
*NL*
who
sent
us
or
by
us
who
came
here
.
Every
day
we
see
something
new
in
*NL*
this
world
;
jokes
become
realities
,
and
the
jokers
find
the
tables
turned
*NL*
upon
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Night
came
,
and
with
the
permission
of
Doctor
Pedro
Recio
,
the
governor
*NL*
had
supper
.
They
then
got
ready
to
go
the
rounds
,
and
he
started
with
the
*NL*
majordomo
,
the
secretary
,
the
head-carver
,
the
chronicler
charged
with
*NL*
recording
his
deeds
,
and
alguacils
and
notaries
enough
to
form
a
*NL*
fair-sized
squadron
.
In
the
midst
marched
Sancho
with
his
staff
,
as
fine
*NL*
a
sight
as
one
could
wish
to
see
,
and
but
a
few
streets
of
the
town
had
*NL*
been
traversed
when
they
heard
a
noise
as
of
a
clashing
of
swords
.
They
*NL*
hastened
to
the
spot
,
and
found
that
the
combatants
were
but
two
,
who
*NL*
seeing
the
authorities
approaching
stood
still
,
and
one
of
them
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Help
,
in
the
name
of
God
and
the
king
!
Are
men
to
be
allowed
*NL*
to
rob
in
the
middle
of
this
town
,
and
rush
out
and
attack
people
in
the
*NL*
very
streets
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
calm
,
my
good
man
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
tell
me
what
the
cause
of
this
*NL*
quarrel
is
;
for
I
am
the
governor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Said
the
other
combatant
,
``
Senor
governor
,
I
will
tell
you
in
a
very
few
*NL*
words
.
Your
worship
must
know
that
this
gentleman
has
just
now
won
more
*NL*
than
a
thousand
reals
in
that
gambling
house
opposite
,
and
God
knows
how
.
*NL*
I
was
there
,
and
gave
more
than
one
doubtful
point
in
his
favour
,
very
*NL*
much
against
what
my
conscience
told
me
.
He
made
off
with
his
winnings
,
*NL*
and
when
I
made
sure
he
was
going
to
give
me
a
crown
or
so
at
least
by
*NL*
way
of
a
present
,
as
it
is
usual
and
customary
to
give
men
of
quality
of
*NL*
my
sort
who
stand
by
to
see
fair
or
foul
play
,
and
back
up
swindles
,
and
*NL*
prevent
quarrels
,
he
pocketed
his
money
and
left
the
house
.
Indignant
at
*NL*
this
I
followed
him
,
and
speaking
him
fairly
and
civilly
asked
him
to
*NL*
give
me
if
it
were
only
eight
reals
,
for
he
knows
I
am
an
honest
man
and
*NL*
that
I
have
neither
profession
nor
property
,
for
my
parents
never
brought
*NL*
me
up
to
any
or
left
me
any
;
but
the
rogue
,
who
is
a
greater
thief
than
*NL*
Cacus
and
a
greater
sharper
than
Andradilla
,
would
not
give
me
more
than
*NL*
four
reals
;
so
your
worship
may
see
how
little
shame
and
conscience
he
*NL*
has
.
But
by
my
faith
if
you
had
not
come
up
I
'd
have
made
him
disgorge
*NL*
his
winnings
,
and
he
'd
have
learned
what
the
range
of
the
steel-yard
*NL*
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say
you
to
this
?
''
asked
Sancho
.
The
other
replied
that
all
his
*NL*
antagonist
said
was
true
,
and
that
he
did
not
choose
to
give
him
more
*NL*
than
four
reals
because
he
very
often
gave
him
money
;
and
that
those
who
*NL*
expected
presents
ought
to
be
civil
and
take
what
is
given
them
with
a
*NL*
cheerful
countenance
,
and
not
make
any
claim
against
winners
unless
they
*NL*
know
them
for
certain
to
be
sharpers
and
their
winnings
to
be
unfairly
*NL*
won
;
and
that
there
could
be
no
better
proof
that
he
himself
was
an
*NL*
honest
man
than
his
having
refused
to
give
anything
;
for
sharpers
always
*NL*
pay
tribute
to
lookers-on
who
know
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
majordomo
;
``
let
your
worship
consider
what
is
to
*NL*
be
done
with
these
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
is
this
;
you
,
the
winner
,
be
you
*NL*
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
,
give
this
assailant
of
yours
a
hundred
reals
*NL*
at
once
,
and
you
must
disburse
thirty
more
for
the
poor
prisoners
;
and
*NL*
you
who
have
neither
profession
nor
property
,
and
hang
about
the
island
*NL*
in
idleness
,
take
these
hundred
reals
now
,
and
some
time
of
the
day
*NL*
to-morrow
quit
the
island
under
sentence
of
banishment
for
ten
years
,
and
*NL*
under
pain
of
completing
it
in
another
life
if
you
violate
the
sentence
,
*NL*
for
I
'll
hang
you
on
a
gibbet
,
or
at
least
the
hangman
will
by
my
orders
;
*NL*
not
a
word
from
either
of
you
,
or
I
'll
make
him
feel
my
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
paid
down
the
money
and
the
other
took
it
,
and
the
latter
quitted
*NL*
the
island
,
while
the
other
went
home
;
and
then
the
governor
said
,
*NL*
``
Either
I
am
not
good
for
much
,
or
I
'll
get
rid
of
these
gambling
houses
,
*NL*
for
it
strikes
me
they
are
very
mischievous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
one
at
least
,
''
said
one
of
the
notaries
,
``
your
worship
will
not
be
*NL*
able
to
get
rid
of
,
for
a
great
man
owns
it
,
and
what
he
loses
every
year
*NL*
is
beyond
all
comparison
more
than
what
he
makes
by
the
cards
.
On
the
*NL*
minor
gambling
houses
your
worship
may
exercise
your
power
,
and
it
is
*NL*
they
that
do
most
harm
and
shelter
the
most
barefaced
practices
;
for
in
*NL*
the
houses
of
lords
and
gentlemen
of
quality
the
notorious
sharpers
dare
*NL*
not
attempt
to
play
their
tricks
;
and
as
the
vice
of
gambling
has
become
*NL*
common
,
it
is
better
that
men
should
play
in
houses
of
repute
than
in
*NL*
some
tradesman
's
,
where
they
catch
an
unlucky
fellow
in
the
small
hours
*NL*
of
the
morning
and
skin
him
alive

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
already
,
notary
,
that
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
that
*NL*
point
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
a
tipstaff
came
up
with
a
young
man
in
his
grasp
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Senor
governor
,
this
youth
was
coming
towards
us

as
soon

he
turned
about
and
ran
like
a
deer
,
a
sure
proof
*NL*
that
he
must
be
some
evil-doer
;
I
ran
after
him

had
it
not
been
that
*NL*
he
stumbled

fell

I
should
never

caught
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
run
for

said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
young
man
replied
,
``
Senor

it
was
to
avoid

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

lay

him

there
to-night

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God

said
the
young
man
,
``

make

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

said
Sancho

*NL*
*NL*
``
All

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

not
able

''
said
Sancho
;
``
take
him
away
at
once
where
he
'll
see
his

his

even
if

gaoler
is
willing
to
exert
his
*NL*
interested
generosity
on

for
I
'll
lay
a
penalty
of
two

ducats
on

allows

stir
a
step
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

ridiculous

said
the
young

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell

said
Sancho

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
the
young

in
a
sprightly
manner
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

truly
,
''
said
the
secretary
,
``
and
the
fellow
has
made
his
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
it
would
be
entirely
of
your
own
choice

keep
from
sleeping

not
in
opposition

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
the
youth
,
``
certainly
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
go
,
and
God
be
with
you

said
Sancho
;
``
be
off
home
to
sleep

*NL*

God
give
you
sound
sleep

for
I
do
n't
want
to
rob
you
of
it
;
but
for
*NL*
the
future
,
let
me
advise
you
do
n't
joke
with
the
authorities
,
because
*NL*
you
may
come
across
some
one
who
will
bring
down
the
joke
on
your
own
*NL*
skull
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
went
his
way
,
and
the
governor
continued
his
round
,
and
*NL*
shortly
afterwards
two
tipstaffs
came
up
with
a
man
in
custody
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Senor
governor
,
this
person
,
who
seems
to
be
a
man
,
is
not
so
,
but
a
*NL*
woman
,
and
not
an
ill-favoured
one
,
in
man
's
clothes
.
''
They
raised
two
or
*NL*
three
lanterns
to
her
face
,
and
by
their
light
they
distinguished
the
*NL*
features
of
a
woman
to
all
appearance
of
the
age
of
sixteen
or
a
little
*NL*
more
,
with
her
hair
gathered
into
a
gold
and
green
silk
net
,
and
fair
as
*NL*
a
thousand
pearls
.
They
scanned
her
from
head
to
foot
,
and
observed
that
*NL*
she
had
on
red
silk
stockings
with
garters
of
white
taffety
bordered
with
*NL*
gold
and
pearl
;
her
breeches
were
of
green
and
gold
stuff
,
and
under
an
*NL*
open
jacket
or
jerkin
of
the
same
she
wore
a
doublet
of
the
finest
white
*NL*
and
gold
cloth
;
her
shoes
were
white
and
such
as
men
wear
;
she
carried
no
*NL*
sword
at
her
belt
,
but
only
a
richly
ornamented
dagger
,
and
on
her
*NL*
fingers
she
had
several
handsome
rings
.
In
short
,
the
girl
seemed
fair
to
*NL*
look
at
in
the
eyes
of
all
,
and
none
of
those
who
beheld
her
knew
her
,
*NL*
the
people
of
the
town
said
they
could
not
imagine
who
she
was
,
and
those
*NL*
who
were
in
on
the
secret
of
the
jokes
that
were
to
be
practised
upon
Sancho
*NL*
were
the
ones
who
were
most
surprised
,
for
this
incident
or
discovery
had
*NL*
not
been
arranged
by
them
;
and
they
watched
anxiously
to
see
how
the
*NL*
affair
would
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
fascinated
by
the
girl
's
beauty
,
and
he
asked
her
who
she
was
,
*NL*
where
she
was
going
,
and
what
had
induced
her
to
dress
herself
in
that
*NL*
garb
.
She
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
answered
in
modest
confusion
,
*NL*
``
I
can
not
tell
you
,
senor
,
before
so
many
people
what
it
is
of
such
*NL*
consequence
to
me
to
have
kept
secret
;
one
thing
I
wish
to
be
known
,
that
*NL*
I
am
no
thief
or
evildoer
,
but
only
an
unhappy
maiden
whom
the
power
of
*NL*
jealousy
has
led
to
break
through
the
respect
that
is
due
to
modesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
the
majordomo
said
to
Sancho
,
``
Make
the
people
stand
back
,
*NL*
senor
governor
,
that
this
lady
may
say
what
she
wishes
with
less
*NL*
embarrassment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
gave
the
order
,
and
all
except
the
majordomo
,
the
head-carver
,
and
*NL*
the
secretary
fell
back
.
Finding
herself
then
in
the
presence
of
no
more
,
*NL*
the
damsel
went
on
to
say
,
``
I
am
the
daughter
,
sirs
,
of
Pedro
Perez
*NL*
Mazorca
,
the
wool-farmer
of
this
town
,
who
is
in
the
habit
of
coming
very
*NL*
often
to
my
father
's
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wo
n't
do
,
senora
,
''
said
the
majordomo
;
``
for
I
know
Pedro
Perez
very
*NL*
well
,
and
I
know
he
has
no
child
at
all
,
either
son
or
daughter
;
and
*NL*
besides
,
though
you
say
he
is
your
father
,
you
add
then
that
he
comes
*NL*
very
often
to
your
father
's
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
already
noticed
that
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
confused
just
now
,
sirs
,
''
said
the
damsel
,
``
and
I
do
n't
know
what
I
*NL*
am
saying
;
but
the
truth
is
that
I
am
the
daughter
of
Diego
de
la
Llana
,
*NL*
whom
you
must
all
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
that
will
do
,
''
said
the
majordomo
;
``
for
I
know
Diego
de
la
Llana
,
*NL*
and
know
that
he
is
a
gentleman
of
position
and
a
rich
man
,
and
that
he
*NL*
has
a
son
and
a
daughter
,
and
that
since
he
was
left
a
widower
nobody
in
*NL*
all
this
town
can
speak
of
having
seen
his
daughter
's
face
;
for
he
keeps
*NL*
her
so
closely
shut
up
that
he
does
not
give
even
the
sun
a
chance
of
*NL*
seeing
her
;
and
for
all
that
report
says
she
is
extremely
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
the
damsel
,
``
and
I
am
that
daughter
;
whether
report
*NL*
lies
or
not
as
to
my
beauty
,
you
,
sirs
,
will
have
decided
by
this
time
,
*NL*
as
you
have
seen
me
;
''
and
with
this
she
began
to
weep
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
seeing
this
the
secretary
leant
over
to
the
head-carver
's
ear
,
and
*NL*
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
``
Something
serious
has
no
doubt
happened
this
*NL*
poor
maiden
,
that
she
goes
wandering
from
home
in
such
a
dress
and
at
*NL*
such
an
hour
,
and
one
of
her
rank
too
.
''
``
There
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
,
''
*NL*
returned
the
carver
,
``
and
moreover
her
tears
confirm
your
suspicion
.
''
*NL*
Sancho
gave
her
the
best
comfort
he
could
,
and
entreated
her
to
tell
them
*NL*
without
any
fear
what
had
happened
her
,
as
they
would
all
earnestly
and
*NL*
by
every
means
in
their
power
endeavour
to
relieve
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
sirs
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
my
father
has
kept
me
shut
up
these
*NL*
ten
years
,
for
so
long
is
it
since
the
earth
received
my
mother
.
Mass
is
*NL*
said
at
home
in
a
sumptuous
chapel
,
and
all
this
time
I
have
seen
but
the
*NL*
sun
in
the
heaven
by
day
,
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
by
night
;
nor
do
I
*NL*
know
what
streets
are
like
,
or
plazas
,
or
churches

or
even
men

except
*NL*
my
father

a
brother
I
have
,
and
Pedro
Perez
the
wool-farmer
;
whom
,
*NL*
because
he
came
frequently
to
our
house
,
I
took
it
into
my
head
to
call
*NL*
my
father
,
to
avoid
naming
my
own
.
This
seclusion
and
the
restrictions
*NL*
laid
upon
my
going
out

were
it
only
to
church
,
have
been
keeping
me
*NL*
unhappy
for
many
a
day
and
month
past
;
I
longed
to
see
the
world
,
or
at
*NL*
least
the
town
where
I
was
born
,
and
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
this
wish
*NL*
was
inconsistent
with
the
respect
maidens
of
good
quality
should
have
for
*NL*
themselves
.
When
I
heard
them
talking
of
bull-fights
taking
place
,
and
of
*NL*
javelin
games
,
and
of
acting
plays
,
I
asked
my
brother
,
who
is
a
year
*NL*
younger
than
myself
,
to
tell
me
what
sort
of
things
these
were
,
and
many
*NL*
more
that
I
had
never
seen
;
he
explained
them
to
me
as
well
as
he
could
,
*NL*
but
the
only
effect
was
to
kindle
in
me
a
still
stronger
desire
to
see
*NL*
them
.
At
last
,
to
cut
short
the
story
of
my
ruin
,
I
begged
and
entreated
*NL*
my
brother
--
O
that
I
had
never
made
such
an
entreaty
-
''
And
once
more
she
*NL*
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed
,
senora
,
''
said
the
majordomo
,
``
and
finish
your
story
of
what
has
*NL*
happened
to
you
,
for
your
words
and
tears
are
keeping
us
all
in
*NL*
suspense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
but
little
more
to
say
,
though
many
a
tear
to
shed
,
''
said
the
*NL*
damsel
;
``
for
ill-placed
desires
can
only
be
paid
for
in
some
such
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
maiden
's
beauty
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
head-carver
's
*NL*
heart
,
and
he
again
raised
his
lantern
for
another
look
at
her
,
and
*NL*
thought
they
were
not
tears
she
was
shedding
,
but
seed-pearl
or
dew
of
*NL*
the
meadow
,
nay
,
he
exalted
them
still
higher
,
and
made
Oriental
pearls
*NL*
of
them
,
and
fervently
hoped
her
misfortune
might
not
be
so
great
a
one
*NL*
as
her
tears
and
sobs
seemed
to
indicate
.
The
governor
was
losing
*NL*
patience
at
the
length
of
time
the
girl
was
taking
to
tell
her
story
,
and
*NL*
told
her
not
to
keep
them
waiting
any
longer
;
for
it
was
late
,
and
there
*NL*
still
remained
a
good
deal
of
the
town
to
be
gone
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
with
broken
sobs
and
half-suppressed
sighs
,
went
on
to
say
,
``
My
*NL*
misfortune
,
my
misadventure
,
is
simply
this
,
that
I
entreated
my
brother
*NL*
to
dress
me
up
as
a
man
in
a
suit
of
his
clothes
,
and
take
me
some
night
,
*NL*
when
our
father
was
asleep
,
to
see
the
whole
town
;
he
,
overcome
by
my
*NL*
entreaties
,
consented
,
and
dressing
me
in
this
suit
and
himself
in
*NL*
clothes
of
mine
that
fitted
him
as
if
made
for
him
-LRB-
for
he
has
not
a
hair
*NL*
on
his
chin
,
and
might
pass
for
a
very
beautiful
young
girl
-RRB-
,
to-night
,
*NL*
about
an
hour
ago
,
more
or
less
,
we
left
the
house
,
and
guided
by
our
*NL*
youthful
and
foolish
impulse
we
made
the
circuit
of
the
whole
town
,
and
*NL*
then
,
as
we
were
about
to
return
home
,
we
saw
a
great
troop
of
people
*NL*
coming
,
and
my
brother
said
to
me
,
`
Sister
,
this
must
be
the
round
,
stir
*NL*
your
feet
and
put
wings
to
them
,
and
follow
me
as
fast
as
you
can
,
lest
*NL*
they
recognise
us
,
for
that
would
be
a
bad
business
for
us
;
'
and
so
*NL*
saying
he
turned
about
and
began
,
I
can
not
say
to
run
but
to
fly
;
in
less
*NL*
than
six
paces
I
fell
from
fright
,
and
then
the
officer
of
justice
came
*NL*
up
and
carried
me
before
your
worships
,
where
I
find
myself
put
to
shame
*NL*
before
all
these
people
as
whimsical
and
vicious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
,
senora
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
no
other
mishap
has
befallen
you
,
nor
*NL*
was
it
jealousy
that
made
you
leave
home
,
as
you
said
at
the
beginning
of
*NL*
your
story
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
has
happened
me
,
''
said
she
,
``
nor
was
it
jealousy
that
brought
me
*NL*
out
,
but
merely
a
longing
to
see
the
world
,
which
did
not
go
beyond
*NL*
seeing
the
streets
of
this
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
appearance
of
the
tipstaffs
with
her
brother
in
custody
,
whom
one
of
*NL*
them
had
overtaken
as
he
ran
away
from
his
sister
,
now
fully
confirmed
*NL*
the
truth
of
what
the
damsel
said
.
He
had
nothing
on
but
a
rich
petticoat
*NL*
and
a
short
blue
damask
cloak
with
fine
gold
lace
,
and
his
head
was
*NL*
uncovered
and
adorned
only
with
its
own
hair
,
which
looked
like
rings
of
*NL*
gold
,
so
bright
and
curly
was
it
.
The
governor
,
the
majordomo
,
and
the
*NL*
carver
went
aside
with
him
,
and
,
unheard
by
his
sister
,
asked
him
how
he
*NL*
came
to
be
in
that
dress
,
and
he
with
no
less
shame
and
embarrassment
*NL*
told
exactly
the
same
story
as
his
sister
,
to
the
great
delight
of
the
*NL*
enamoured
carver
;
the
governor
,
however
,
said
to
them
,
``
In
truth
,
young
*NL*
lady
and
gentleman
,
this
has
been
a
very
childish
affair
,
and
to
explain
*NL*
your
folly
and
rashness
there
was
no
necessity
for
all
this
delay
and
all
*NL*
these
tears
and
sighs
;
for
if
you
had
said
we
are
so-and-so
,
and
we
*NL*
escaped
from
our
father
's
house
in
this
way
in
order
to
ramble
about
,
out
*NL*
of
mere
curiosity
and
with
no
other
object
,
there
would
have
been
an
end
*NL*
of
the
matter
,
and
none
of
these
little
sobs
and
tears
and
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
damsel
,
``
but
you
see
the
confusion
I
was
in
was
*NL*
so
great
it
did
not
let
me
behave
as
I
ought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
harm
has
been
done
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
come
,
we
will
leave
you
at
your
*NL*
father
's
house
;
perhaps
they
will
not
have
missed
you
;
and
another
time
*NL*
do
n't
be
so
childish
or
eager
to
see
the
world
;
for
a
respectable
damsel
*NL*
should
have
a
broken
leg
and
keep
at
home
;
and
the
woman
and
the
hen
by
*NL*
gadding
about
are
soon
lost
;
and
she
who
is
eager
to
see
is
also
eager
to
*NL*
be
seen
;
I
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
thanked
the
governor
for
his
kind
offer
to
take
them
home
,
and
*NL*
they
directed
their
steps
towards
the
house
,
which
was
not
far
off
.
On
*NL*
reaching
it
the
youth
threw
a
pebble
up
at
a
grating
,
and
immediately
a
*NL*
woman-servant
who
was
waiting
for
them
came
down
and
opened
the
door
to
*NL*
them
,
and
they
went
in
,
leaving
the
party
marvelling
as
much
at
their
*NL*
grace
and
beauty
as
at
the
fancy
they
had
for
seeing
the
world
by
night
*NL*
and
without
quitting
the
village
;
which
,
however
,
they
set
down
to
their
*NL*
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
head-carver
was
left
with
a
heart
pierced
through
and
through
,
and
he
*NL*
made
up
his
mind
on
the
spot
to
demand
the
damsel
in
marriage
of
her
*NL*
father
on
the
morrow
,
making
sure
she
would
not
be
refused
him
as
he
was
*NL*
a
servant
of
the
duke
's
;
and
even
to
Sancho
ideas
and
schemes
of
marrying
*NL*
the
youth
to
his
daughter
Sanchica
suggested
themselves
,
and
he
resolved
*NL*
to
open
the
negotiation
at
the
proper
season
,
persuading
himself
that
no
*NL*
husband
could
be
refused
to
a
governor
's
daughter
.
And
so
the
night
's
*NL*
round
came
to
an
end
,
and
a
couple
of
days
later
the
government
,
whereby
*NL*
all
his
plans
were
overthrown
and
swept
away
,
as
will
be
seen
farther
on
.

WHEREIN
IS
SET
FORTH
WHO
THE
ENCHANTERS

WERE
WHO
FLOGGED

DUENNA
AND
PINCHED
DON

,

*NL*
*NL*
Cide
Hamete
,
the
painstaking
investigator
of
the
minute
points
of
this
*NL*
veracious
history
,
says
that
when
Dona
Rodriguez
left
her
own
room
to
go
*NL*
to
Don
Quixote
's
,
another
duenna
who
slept
with
her
observed
her
,
and
as
*NL*
all
duennas
are
fond
of
prying
,
listening
,
and
sniffing
,
she
followed
her
*NL*
so
silently
that
the
good
Rodriguez
never
perceived
it
;
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
duenna
saw
her
enter
Don
Quixote
's
room
,
not
to
fail
in
a
duenna
's
*NL*
invariable
practice
of
tattling
,
she
hurried
off
that
instant
to
report
*NL*
to
the
duchess
how
Dona
Rodriguez
was
closeted
with
Don
Quixote
.
The
*NL*
duchess
told
the
duke
,
and
asked
him
to
let
her
and
Altisidora
go
and
see
*NL*
what
the
said
duenna
wanted
with
Don
Quixote
.
The
duke
gave
them
leave
,
*NL*
and
the
pair
cautiously
and
quietly
crept
to
the
door
of
the
room
and
*NL*
posted
themselves
so
close
to
it
that
they
could
hear
all
that
was
said
*NL*
inside
.
But
when
the
duchess
heard
how
the
Rodriguez
had
made
public
the
*NL*
Aranjuez
of
her
issues
she
could
not
restrain
herself
,
nor
Altisidora
*NL*
either
;
and
so
,
filled
with
rage
and
thirsting
for
vengeance
,
they
burst
*NL*
into
the
room
and
tormented
Don
Quixote
and
flogged
the
duenna
in
the
*NL*
manner
already
described
;
for
indignities
offered
to
their
charms
and
*NL*
self-esteem
mightily
provoke
the
anger
of
women
and
make
them
eager
for
*NL*
revenge
.
The
duchess
told
the
duke
what
had
happened
,
and
he
was
much
*NL*
amused
by
it
;
and
she
,
in
pursuance
of
her
design
of
making
merry
and
*NL*
diverting
herself
with
Don
Quixote
,
despatched
the
page
who
had
played
*NL*
the
part
of
Dulcinea
in
the
negotiations
for
her
disenchantment
-LRB-
which
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
in
the
cares
of
government
had
forgotten
all
about
-RRB-
to
*NL*
Teresa
Panza
his
wife
with
her
husband
's
letter
and
another
from
herself
,
*NL*
and
also
a
great
string
of
fine
coral
beads
as
a
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
history
says
this
page
was
very
sharp
and
quick-witted
;
and
eager
*NL*
to
serve
his
lord
and
lady
he
set
off
very
willingly
for
Sancho
's
*NL*
village
.
Before
he
entered
it
he
observed
a
number
of
women
washing
in
a
*NL*
brook
,
and
asked
them
if
they
could
tell
him
whether
there
lived
there
a
*NL*
woman
of
the
name
of
Teresa
Panza
,
wife
of
one
Sancho
Panza
,
squire
to
a
*NL*
knight
called
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
.
At
the
question
a
young
girl
who
*NL*
was
washing
stood
up
and
said
,
``
Teresa
Panza
is
my
mother
,
and
that
*NL*
Sancho
is
my
father
,
and
that
knight
is
our
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
miss
,
''
said
the
page
,
``
come
and
show
me
where
your
mother
is
,
*NL*
for
I
bring
her
a
letter
and
a
present
from
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
with
all
my
heart
,
senor
,
''
said
the
girl
,
who
seemed
to
be
*NL*
about
fourteen
,
more
or
less
;
and
leaving
the
clothes
she
was
washing
to
*NL*
one
of
her
companions
,
and
without
putting
anything
on
her
head
or
feet
,
*NL*
for
she
was
bare-legged
and
had
her
hair
hanging
about
her
,
away
she
*NL*
skipped
in
front
of
the
page
's
horse
,
saying
,
``
Come
,
your
worship
,
our
*NL*
house
is
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
,
and
my
mother
is
there
,
sorrowful
*NL*
enough
at
not
having
had
any
news
of
my
father
this
ever
so
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
page
,
``
I
am
bringing
her
such
good
news
that
she
will
*NL*
have
reason
to
thank
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
skipping
,
running
,
and
capering
,
the
girl
reached
the
town
,
but
*NL*
before
going
into
the
house
she
called
out
at
the
door
,
``
Come
out

mother
*NL*
Teresa

come
out

come
out

here
's

other
*NL*
things
from
my
good
father

At
these
words
her
mother
Teresa
Panza
came
*NL*
out
spinning
a
bundle
of
flax
,
in
a
grey
petticoat
-LRB-
so
short
was
it
one
*NL*
would
have
fancied
``
they
to
her
shame
had
cut
it
short
''
-RRB-
,
a
grey
bodice
*NL*
of
the
same
stuff
,
and
a
smock
.
She
was
not
very
old
,
though
plainly
past
*NL*
forty
,
strong
,
healthy
,
vigorous
,
and
sun-dried
;
and
seeing
her
daughter
*NL*
and
the
page
on
horseback
,
she
exclaimed
,
``
What
's
this
,
child
?
What
*NL*
gentleman
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
servant
of
my
lady
,
Dona
Teresa
Panza

''
replied
the
page
;
and
suiting
*NL*
the
action
to
the
word
he
flung
himself
off
his
horse
,
and
with
great
*NL*
humility
advanced
to
kneel
before
the
lady
Teresa
,
saying
,
``
Let
me
kiss
*NL*
your
hand

Senora
Dona
Teresa

as

only

Sancho
Panza

rightful
governor

island
of
Barataria

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
senor
,
get
up
,
do
that
,
''
said
Teresa
;
``
for
I
'm
not
a
bit

daughter

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are

said
the

,
``
the

as
a
proof
of
what
I
say
accept
this
letter
and
this
*NL*
present
;
''
and
at
the
same
time
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
string
of
*NL*
coral
beads
with
gold
clasps
,
and
placed
it
on
her
neck
,
and
said
,
``
This
*NL*
letter
is
from
his
lordship
the
governor
,
and
the
other
as
well
as
these
*NL*
coral
beads
from
my
lady
the
duchess
,
who
sends
me
to
your
worship

''
*NL*
*NL*
Teresa
stood
lost
in
astonishment
,
and
her
daughter
just
as
much
,
and
the
*NL*
girl
said
,
``
May
I
die
but
our
master
Don
Quixote
's
at
the
bottom
of
this
;
*NL*
he
must
have
given
father
the
government
or
county
he
so
often
promised
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
truth
,
''
said
the
page
;
``
for
it
is
through
Senor
Don
Quixote
*NL*
that
Senor
Sancho
is
now
governor
of
the
island
of
Barataria
,
as
will
be
*NL*
seen
by
this
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
your
worship
read
it
to
me
,
noble
sir
?
''
said
Teresa
;
``
for
though
I
*NL*
can
spin
I
ca
n't
read
,
not
a
scrap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
either
,
''
said
Sanchica
;
``
but
wait
a
bit
,
and
I
'll
go
and
fetch
*NL*
some
one
who
can
read
it
,
either
the
curate
himself
or
the
bachelor
*NL*
Samson
Carrasco
,

they
'll
come
gladly
to
hear
any
news
of
my
father

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
need
to
fetch
anybody
,
''
said
the
page
;
``
for
though
I
ca
n't
*NL*
spin
I
can
read
,
and
I
'll
read
it

and
so
he
read
it
through
,
but
as
it
*NL*
has
been
already
given
it
is
not
inserted
here
;
and
then
he
took
out
the
*NL*
other
one
from
the
duchess
,
which
ran
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
Friend
Teresa
,
--
Your
husband
Sancho
's
good
qualities
,
of
heart
as
well
as
*NL*
of
head
,
induced
and
compelled
me
to
request
my
husband
the
duke
to
give
*NL*
him
the
government
of
one
of
his
many
islands
.
I
am
told
he
governs
like
*NL*
a
gerfalcon
,
of
which
I
am
very
glad
,
and
my
lord
the
duke
,
of
course
,
*NL*
also
;
and
I
am
very
thankful
to
heaven
that
I
have
not
made
a
mistake
in
*NL*
choosing
him
for
that
same
government
;
for
I
would
have
Senora
Teresa
*NL*
know
that
a
good
governor
is
hard
to
find
in
this
world
and
may
God
make
*NL*
me
as
good
as
Sancho
's
way
of
governing
.
Herewith
I
send
you
,
my
dear
,
a
*NL*
string
of
coral
beads
with
gold
clasps
;
I
wish
they
were
Oriental
pearls
;
*NL*
but
``
he
who
gives
thee
a
bone
does
not
wish
to
see
thee
dead
;
''
a
time
*NL*
will
come
when
we
shall
become
acquainted
and
meet
one
another
,
but
God
*NL*
knows
the
future
.
Commend
me
to
your
daughter
Sanchica
,
and
tell
her
from
*NL*
me
to
hold
herself
in
readiness
,
for
I
mean
to
make
a
high
match
for
her
*NL*
when
she
least
expects
it
.
They
tell
me
there
are
big
acorns
in
your
*NL*
village
;
send
me
a
couple
of
dozen
or
so
,
and
I
shall
value
them
greatly
*NL*
as
coming
from
your
hand
;
and
write
to
me
at
length
to
assure
me
of
your
*NL*
health
and
well-being
;
and
if
there
be
anything
you
stand
in
need
of
,
it
*NL*
is
but
to
open
your
mouth
,
and
that
shall
be
the
measure
;
and
so
God
keep
*NL*
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
place
.
Your
loving
friend
,
THE
DUCHESS
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
good
,
plain
,
lowly
lady
!
''
said
Teresa
when
she
heard
the
*NL*
letter
;
``
that
I
may
be
buried
with
ladies
of
that
sort
,
and
not
the
*NL*
gentlewomen
we
have
in
this
town
,
that
fancy
because
they
are
gentlewomen
*NL*
the
wind
must
not
touch
them
,
and
go
to
church
with
as
much
airs
as
if
*NL*
they
were
queens
,
no
less
,
and
seem
to
think
they
are
disgraced
if
they
*NL*
look
at
a
farmer
's
wife
!
And
see
here
how
this
good
lady
,
for
all
she
's
a
*NL*
duchess
,
calls
me
`
friend
,
'
and
treats
me
as
if
I
was
her
equal
--
and
*NL*
equal
may
I
see
her
with
the
tallest
church-tower
in
La
Mancha
!
And
as
*NL*
for
the
acorns
,
senor
,
I
'll
send
her
ladyship
a
peck
and
such
big
ones
*NL*
that
one
might
come
to
see
them
as
a
show
and
a
wonder
.
And
now
,
*NL*
Sanchica
,
see
that
the
gentleman
is
comfortable
;
put
up
his
horse
,
and
*NL*
get
some
eggs
out
of
the
stable
,
and
cut
plenty
of
bacon
,
and
let
's
give
*NL*
him
his
dinner
like
a
prince
;
for
the
good
news
he
has
brought
,
and
his
*NL*
own
bonny
face
deserve
it
all
;
and
meanwhile
I
'll
run
out
and
give
the
*NL*
neighbours
the
news
of
our
good
luck
,
and
father
curate
,
and
Master
*NL*
Nicholas
the
barber
,
who
are
and
always
have
been
such
friends
of
thy
*NL*
father
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
,
mother
,
''
said
Sanchica
;
``
but
mind
,
you
must
give
me
half
of
*NL*
that
string
;
for
I
do
n't
think
my
lady
the
duchess
could
have
been
so
*NL*
stupid
as
to
send
it
all
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
for
thee
,
my
child
,
''
said
Teresa
;
``
but
let
me
wear
it
round
my
*NL*
neck
for
a
few
days
;
for
verily
it
seems
to
make
my
heart
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
glad
too
,
''
said
the
page
,
``
when
you
see
the
bundle
there
is
*NL*
in
this
portmanteau
,
for
it
is
a
suit
of
the
finest
cloth
,
that
the
*NL*
governor
only
wore
one
day
out
hunting
and
now
sends
,
all
for
Senora
*NL*
Sanchica
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
he
live
a
thousand
years
,
''
said
Sanchica
,
``
and
the
bearer
as
many
,
*NL*
nay
two
thousand
,
if
needful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
Teresa
hurried
out
of
the
house
with
the
letters
,
and
with
the
*NL*
string
of
beads
round
her
neck
,
and
went
along
thrumming
the
letters
as
*NL*
if
they
were
a
tambourine
,
and
by
chance
coming
across
the
curate
and
*NL*
Samson
Carrasco
she
began
capering
and
saying
,
``
None
of
us
poor
now
,
*NL*
faith
!
We
've
got
a
little
government
!
Ay
,
let
the
finest
fine
lady
tackle
*NL*
me
,
and
I
'll
give
her
a
setting
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
all
this
,
Teresa
Panza
,
''
said
they
;
``
what
madness
is
this
,
and
*NL*
what
papers
are
those
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
madness
is
only
this
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
these
are
the
letters
of
*NL*
duchesses
and
governors
,
and
these
I
have
on
my
neck
are
fine
coral
*NL*
beads
,
with
ave-marias
and
paternosters
of
beaten
gold
,
and
I
am
a
*NL*
governess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
help
us
,
''
said
the
curate
,
``
we
do
n't
understand
you
,
Teresa
,
or
know
*NL*
what
you
are
talking
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
may
see
it
yourselves
,
''
said
Teresa
,
and
she
handed
them
the
*NL*
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
read
them
out
for
Samson
Carrasco
to
hear
,
and
Samson
and
he
*NL*
regarded
one
another
with
looks
of
astonishment
at
what
they
had
read
,
*NL*
and
the
bachelor
asked
who
had
brought
the
letters
.
Teresa
in
reply
bade
*NL*
them
come
with
her
to
her
house
and
they
would
see
the
messenger
,
a
most
*NL*
elegant
youth
,
who
had
brought
another
present
which
was
worth
as
much
*NL*
more
.
The
curate
took
the
coral
beads
from
her
neck
and
examined
them
*NL*
again
and
again
,
and
having
satisfied
himself
as
to
their
fineness
he
*NL*
fell
to
wondering
afresh
,
and
said
,
``
By
the
gown
I
wear
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
to
say
or
think
of
these
letters
and
presents
;
on
the
one
hand
I
can
see
*NL*
and
feel
the
fineness
of
these
coral
beads
,
and
on
the
other
I
read
how
a
*NL*
duchess
sends
to
beg
for
a
couple
of
dozen
of
acorns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Square
that
if
you
can
,
''
said
Carrasco
;
``
well
,
let
's
go
and
see
the
*NL*
messenger
,
and
from
him
we
'll
learn
something
about
this
mystery
that
has
*NL*
turned
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
so
,
and
Teresa
returned
with
them
.
They
found
the
page
sifting
a
*NL*
little
barley
for
his
horse
,
and
Sanchica
cutting
a
rasher
of
bacon
to
be
*NL*
paved
with
eggs
for
his
dinner
.
His
looks
and
his
handsome
apparel
*NL*
pleased
them
both
greatly
;
and
after
they
had
saluted
him
courteously
,
*NL*
and
he
them
,
Samson
begged
him
to
give
them
his
news
,
as
well
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
as
of
Sancho
Panza
,
for
,
he
said
,
though
they
had
read
the
*NL*
letters
from
Sancho
and
her
ladyship
the
duchess
,
they
were
still
puzzled
*NL*
and
could
not
make
out
what
was
meant
by
Sancho
's
government
,
and
above
*NL*
all
of
an
island
,
when
all
or
most
of
those
in
the
Mediterranean
belonged
*NL*
to
his
Majesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
page
replied
,
``
As
to
Senor
Sancho
Panza
's
being
a
governor
*NL*
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
;
but
whether
it
is
an
island
or
not
that
he
*NL*
governs
,
with
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
;
suffice
it
that
it
is
a
town
of
*NL*
more
than
a
thousand
inhabitants
;
with
regard
to
the
acorns
I
may
tell
*NL*
you
my
lady
the
duchess
is
so
unpretending
and
unassuming
that
,
not
to
*NL*
speak
of
sending
to
beg
for
acorns
from
a
peasant
woman
,
she
has
been
*NL*
known
to
send
to
ask
for
the
loan
of
a
comb
from
one
of
her
neighbours
;
*NL*
for
I
would
have
your
worships
know
that
the
ladies
of
Aragon
,
though
*NL*
they
are
just
as
illustrious
,
are
not
so
punctilious
and
haughty
as
the
*NL*
Castilian
ladies
;
they
treat
people
with
greater
familiarity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
this
conversation
Sanchica
came
in
with
her
skirt
full
*NL*
of
eggs
,
and
said
she
to
the
page
,
``
Tell
me
,
senor
,
does
my
father
wear
*NL*
trunk-hose
since
he
has
been
governor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
noticed
,
''
said
the
page
;
``
but
no
doubt
he
wears
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
my
God
!
''
said
Sanchica
,
``
what
a
sight
it
must
be
to
see
my
father
in
*NL*
tights
!
Is
n't
it
odd
that
ever
since
I
was
born
I
have
had
a
longing
to
*NL*
see
my
father
in
trunk-hose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
things
go
you
will
see
that
if
you
live
,
''
said
the
page
;
``
by
God
he
*NL*
is
in
the
way
to
take
the
road
with
a
sunshade
if
the
government
only
*NL*
lasts
him
two
months
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
and
the
bachelor
could
see
plainly
enough
that
the
page
spoke
*NL*
in
a
waggish
vein
;
but
the
fineness
of
the
coral
beads
,
and
the
hunting
*NL*
suit
that
Sancho
sent
-LRB-
for
Teresa
had
already
shown
it
to
them
-RRB-
did
away
*NL*
with
the
impression
;
and
they
could
not
help
laughing
at
Sanchica
's
wish
,
*NL*
and
still
more
when
Teresa
said
,
``
Senor
curate
,
look
about
if
there
's
*NL*
anybody
here
going
to
Madrid

Toledo

to
buy
me
a
hooped
petticoat
,
a
*NL*
proper
fashionable
one
of
the
best
quality
;
for
indeed
and
indeed
I
must
*NL*
do
honour
to
my
husband
's
government
as
well
as
I
can
;
nay
,
if
I
am
put
*NL*
to
it
and
have
to
,
I
'll
go
to
Court
and
set
a
coach
like
all
the
world
;
*NL*
for
she
who
has
a
governor
for
her
husband
may
very
well
have
one
and
*NL*
keep
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
,
mother
!
''
said
Sanchica
;
``
would
to
God
it
were
to-day

them
tramp
through

mud

let
me
go
in

feet
off

Bad

go
warm

right

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
the
curate
said
,
``
I
do
believe
that
all
this

of
the
*NL*
Panzas
are
born
with
a
sackful
of

in

insides
,
every
one
of

them
;
I
never
saw
one
of

that
does
not
pour
them
out
at
all
times

on
all
occasions

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true

said
the
page
,
``

them

*NL*
they
amuse

my

about

the
bachelor
,
``

that
there
actually
is
a

him

Because
we

we
have
*NL*
handled
the

read

do
n't
believe
it

suspect
it

to
be
something
in
the
line
of
our
fellow-townsman
Don
Quixote
,
who
*NL*
fancies
that
everything
is
done
by
enchantment

for
this
reason
I
am
*NL*
almost
ready
to
say
that
I

like

*NL*

All
I
know

is
that

am
a

refused

had
to

the

took
him

an

The

offered
to
write

for
Teresa

*NL*
but
she
did
not
care
to
let
him
mix
himself
up

she

thought
him
somewhat
given

she
gave

CHAPTER
LI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
PROGRESS
OF
SANCHO
'S
GOVERNMENT
,
AND
OTHER
SUCH
ENTERTAINING
*NL*
MATTERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Day
came
after
the
night
of
the
governor
's
round
;
a
night
which
the
*NL*
head-carver
passed
without
sleeping
,
so
were
his
thoughts
of
the
face
and
*NL*
air
and
beauty
of
the
disguised
damsel
,
while
the
majordomo
spent
what
*NL*
was
left
of
it
in
writing
an
account
to
his
lord
and
lady
of
all
Sancho
*NL*
said
and
did
,
being
as
much
amazed
at
his
sayings
as
at
his
doings
,
for
*NL*
there
was
a
mixture
of
shrewdness
and
simplicity
in
all
his
words
and
*NL*
deeds
.
The
senor
governor
got
up
,
and
by
Doctor
Pedro
Recio
's
directions
*NL*
they
made
him
break
his
fast
on
a
little
conserve
and
four
sups
of
cold
*NL*
water
,
which
Sancho
would
have
readily
exchanged
for
a
piece
of
bread
and
*NL*
a
bunch
of
grapes
;
but
seeing
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
he
submitted
with
*NL*
no
little
sorrow
of
heart
and
discomfort
of
stomach
;
Pedro
Recio
having
*NL*
persuaded
him
that
light
and
delicate
diet
enlivened
the
wits
,
and
that
*NL*
was
what
was
most
essential
for
persons
placed
in
command
and
in
*NL*
responsible
situations
,
where
they
have
to
employ
not
only
the
bodily
*NL*
powers
but
those
of
the
mind
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
means
of
this
sophistry
Sancho
was
made
to
endure
hunger
,
and
hunger
*NL*
so
keen
that
in
his
heart
he
cursed
the
government
,
and
even
him
who
had
*NL*
given
it
to
him
;
however
,
with
his
hunger
and
his
conserve
he
undertook
*NL*
to
deliver
judgments
that
day
,
and
the
first
thing
that
came
before
him
*NL*
was
a
question
that
was
submitted
to
him
by
a
stranger
,
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
the
majordomo
and
the
other
attendants
,
and
it
was
in
these
words
:
*NL*
``
Senor
,
a
large
river
separated
two
districts
of
one
and
the
same
*NL*
lordship
--
will
your
worship
please
to
pay
attention
,
for
the
case
is
an
*NL*
important
and
a
rather
knotty
one
?
Well
then
,
on
this
river
there
was
a
*NL*
bridge
,
and
at
one
end
of
it
a
gallows
,
and
a
sort
of
tribunal
,
where
*NL*
four
judges
commonly
sat
to
administer
the
law
which
the
lord
of
river
,
*NL*
bridge
and
the
lordship
had
enacted
,
and
which
was
to
this
effect
,
`
If
*NL*
anyone
crosses
by
this
bridge
from
one
side
to
the
other
he
shall
declare
*NL*
on
oath
where
he
is
going
to
and
with
what
object
;
and
if
he
swears
*NL*
truly
,
he
shall
be
allowed
to
pass
,
but
if
falsely
,
he
shall
be
put
to
*NL*
death
for
it
by
hanging
on
the
gallows
erected
there
,
without
any
*NL*
remission
.
'
Though
the
law
and
its
severe
penalty
were
known
,
many
*NL*
persons
crossed
,
but
in
their
declarations
it
was
easy
to
see
at
once
*NL*
they
were
telling
the
truth
,
and
the
judges
let
them
pass
free
.
It
*NL*
happened
,
however
,
that
one
man
,
when
they
came
to
take
his
declaration
,
*NL*
swore
and
said
that
by
the
oath
he
took
he
was
going
to
die
upon
that
*NL*
gallows
that
stood
there
,
and
nothing
else
.
The
judges
held
a
*NL*
consultation
over
the
oath
,
and
they
said
,
`
If
we
let
this
man
pass
free
*NL*
he
has
sworn
falsely
,
and
by
the
law
he
ought
to
die
;
but
if
we
hang
him
,
*NL*
as
he
swore
he
was
going
to
die
on
that
gallows
,
and
therefore
swore
the
*NL*
truth
,
by
the
same
law
he
ought
to
go
free
.
'
It
is
asked
of
your
worship
,
*NL*
senor
governor
,
what
are
the
judges
to
do
with
this
man
?
For
they
are
*NL*
still
in
doubt
and
perplexity
;
and
having
heard
of
your
worship
's
acute
*NL*
and
exalted
intellect
,
they
have
sent
me
to
entreat
your
worship
on
their
*NL*
behalf
to
give
your
opinion
on
this
very
intricate
and
puzzling
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Sancho
made
answer
,
``
Indeed
those
gentlemen
the
judges
that
send
*NL*
you
to
me
might
have
spared
themselves
the
trouble
,
for
I
have
more
of
*NL*
the
obtuse
than
the
acute
in
me
;
but
repeat
the
case
over
again
,
so
that
*NL*
I
may
understand
it
,
and
then
perhaps
I
may
be
able
to
hit
the
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
querist
repeated
again
and
again
what
he
had
said
before
,
and
then
*NL*
Sancho
said
,
``
It
seems
to
me
I
can
set
the
matter
right
in
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
in
this
way
;
the
man
swears
that
he
is
going
to
die
upon
the
gallows
;
but
*NL*
if
he
dies
upon
it
,
he
has
sworn
the
truth
,
and
by
the
law
enacted
*NL*
deserves
to
go
free
and
pass
over
the
bridge
;
but
if
they
do
n't
hang
him
,
*NL*
then
he
has
sworn
falsely
,
and
by
the
same
law
deserves
to
be
hanged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
the
senor
governor
says
,
''
said
the
messenger
;
``
and
as
regards
a
*NL*
complete
comprehension
of
the
case
,
there
is
nothing
left
to
desire
or
*NL*
hesitate
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
I
say
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
of
this
man
they
should
let
pass
*NL*
the
part
that
has
sworn
truly
,
and
hang
the
part
that
has
lied
;
and
in
*NL*
this
way
the
conditions
of
the
passage
will
be
fully
complied
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
,
senor
governor
,
''
replied
the
querist
,
``
the
man
will
have
to
be
*NL*
divided
into
two
parts
;
and
if
he
is
divided
of
course
he
will
die
;
and
*NL*
so
none
of
the
requirements
of
the
law
will
be
carried
out
,
and
it
is
*NL*
absolutely
necessary
to
comply
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
my
good
sir
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
either
I
'm
a
numskull
or
else
*NL*
there
is
the
same
reason
for
this
passenger
dying
as
for
his
living
and
*NL*
passing
over
the
bridge
;
for
if
the
truth
saves
him
the
falsehood
equally
*NL*
condemns
him
;
and
that
being
the
case
it
is
my
opinion
you
should
say
to
*NL*
the
gentlemen
who
sent
you
to
me
that
as
the
arguments
for
condemning
him
*NL*
and
for
absolving
him
are
exactly
balanced
,
they
should
let
him
pass
*NL*
freely
,
as
it
is
always
more
praiseworthy
to
do
good
than
to
do
evil
;
*NL*
this
I
would
give
signed
with
my
name
if
I
knew
how
to
sign
;
and
what
I
*NL*
have
said
in
this
case
is
not
out
of
my
own
head
,
but
one
of
the
many
*NL*
precepts
my
master
Don
Quixote
gave
me
the
night
before
I
left
to
become
*NL*
governor
of
this
island
,
that
came
into
my
mind
,
and
it
was
this
,
that
*NL*
when
there
was
any
doubt
about
the
justice
of
a
case
I
should
lean
to
*NL*
mercy
;
and
it
is
God
's
will
that
I
should
recollect
it
now
,
for
it
fits
*NL*
this
case
as
if
it
was
made
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
majordomo
;
``
and
I
maintain
that
Lycurgus
*NL*
himself
,
who
gave
laws
to
the
Lacedemonians
,
could
not
have
pronounced
a
*NL*
better
decision
than
the
great
Panza
has
given
;
let
the
morning
's
*NL*
audience
close
with
this
,
and
I
will
see
that
the
senor
governor
has
*NL*
dinner
entirely
to
his
liking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
I
ask
for
--
fair
play
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
give
me
my
dinner
,
and
*NL*
then
let
it
rain
cases
and
questions
on
me
,
and
I
'll
despatch
them
in
a
*NL*
twinkling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
majordomo
kept
his
word
,
for
he
felt
it
against
his
conscience
to
*NL*
kill
so
wise
a
governor
by
hunger
;
particularly
as
he
intended
to
have
*NL*
done
with
him
that
same
night
,
playing
off
the
last
joke
he
was
*NL*
commissioned
to
practise
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
to
pass
,
then
,
that
after
he
had
dined
that
day
,
in
opposition
to
*NL*
the
rules
and
aphorisms
of
Doctor
Tirteafuera
,
as
they
were
taking
away
*NL*
the
cloth
there
came
a
courier
with
a
letter
from
Don
Quixote
for
the
*NL*
governor
.
Sancho
ordered
the
secretary
to
read
it
to
himself
,
and
if
*NL*
there
was
nothing
in
it
that
demanded
secrecy
to
read
it
aloud
.
The
*NL*
secretary
did
so
,
and
after
he
had
skimmed
the
contents
he
said
,
``
It
may
*NL*
well
be
read
aloud
,
for
what
Senor
Don
Quixote
writes
to
your
worship

deserves
to
be
printed
or
written
in

,
I
have
received
intelligence
of
thy
displays
of
good
sense
,
for
*NL*
which
I
give
special
thanks
to
heaven
that
can
raise
the
poor
from
the
*NL*
dunghill
and
of
fools
to
make
wise
men
.
They
tell
me
thou
dost
govern
as
*NL*
if
thou
wert
a
man
,
and
art
a
man
as
if
thou
wert
a
beast
,
so
great
is
*NL*
the
humility
wherewith
thou
dost
comport
thyself
.
But
I
would
have
thee
*NL*
bear
in
mind
,
Sancho
,
that
very
often
it
is
fitting
and
necessary
for
the
*NL*
authority
of
office
to
resist
the
humility
of
the
heart
;
for
the
seemly
*NL*
array
of
one
who
is
invested
with
grave
duties
should
be
such
as
they
*NL*
require
and
not
measured
by
what
his
own
humble
tastes
may
lead
him
to
*NL*
prefer
.
Dress
well
;
a
stick
dressed
up
does
not
look
like
a
stick
;
I
do
*NL*
not
say
thou
shouldst
wear
trinkets
or
fine
raiment
,
or
that
being
a
*NL*
judge
thou
shouldst
dress
like
a
soldier
,
but
that
thou
shouldst
array
*NL*
thyself
in
the
apparel
thy
office
requires
,
and
that
at
the
same
time
it
*NL*
be
neat
and
handsome
.
To
win
the
good-will
of
the
people
thou
governest
*NL*
there
are
two
things
,
among
others
,
that
thou
must
do
;
one
is
to
be
civil
*NL*
to
all
-LRB-
this
,
however
,
I
told
thee
before
-RRB-
,
and
the
other
to
take
care
*NL*
that
food
be
abundant
,
for
there
is
nothing
that
vexes
the
heart
of
the
*NL*
poor
more
than
hunger
and
high
prices
.
Make
not
many
proclamations
;
but
*NL*
those
thou
makest
take
care
that
they
be
good
ones
,
and
above
all
that
*NL*
they
be
observed
and
carried
out
;
for
proclamations
that
are
not
observed
*NL*
are
the
same
as
if
they
did
not
exist
;
nay
,
they
encourage
the
idea
that
*NL*
the
prince
who
had
the
wisdom
and
authority
to
make
them
had
not
the
*NL*
power
to
enforce
them
;
and
laws
that
threaten
and
are
not
enforced
come
*NL*
to
be
like
the
log
,
the
king
of
the
frogs
,
that
frightened
them
at
first
,
*NL*
but
that
in
time
they
despised
and
mounted
upon
.
Be
a
father
to
virtue
*NL*
and
a
stepfather
to
vice
.
Be
not
always
strict
,
nor
yet
always
lenient
,
*NL*
but
observe
a
mean
between
these
two
extremes
,
for
in
that
is
the
aim
of
*NL*
wisdom
.
Visit
the
gaols
,
the
slaughter-houses
,
and
the
market-places
;
for
*NL*
the
presence
of
the
governor
is
of
great
importance
in
such
places
;
it
*NL*
comforts
the
prisoners
who
are
in
hopes
of
a
speedy
release
,
it
is
the
*NL*
bugbear
of
the
butchers
who
have
then
to
give
just
weight
,
and
it
is
the
*NL*
terror
of
the
market-women
for
the
same
reason
.
Let
it
not
be
seen
that
*NL*
thou
art
-LRB-
even
if
perchance
thou
art
,
which
I
do
not
believe
-RRB-
covetous
,
a
*NL*
follower
of
women
,
or
a
glutton
;
for
when
the
people
and
those
that
have
*NL*
dealings
with
thee
become
aware
of
thy
special
weakness
they
will
bring
*NL*
their
batteries
to
bear
upon
thee
in
that
quarter
,
till
they
have
brought
*NL*
thee
down
to
the
depths
of
perdition
.
Consider
and
reconsider
,
con
and
*NL*
con
over
again
the
advices
and
the
instructions
I
gave
thee
before
thy
*NL*
departure
hence
to
thy
government
,
and
thou
wilt
see
that
in
them
,
if
*NL*
thou
dost
follow
them
,
thou
hast
a
help
at
hand
that
will
lighten
for
*NL*
thee
the
troubles
and
difficulties
that
beset
governors
at
every
step
.
*NL*
Write
to
thy
lord
and
lady
and
show
thyself
grateful
to
them
,
for
*NL*
ingratitude
is
the
daughter
of
pride
,
and
one
of
the
greatest
sins
we
*NL*
know
of
;
and
he
who
is
grateful
to
those
who
have
been
good
to
him
shows
*NL*
that
he
will
be
so
to
God
also
who
has
bestowed
and
still
bestows
so
many
*NL*
blessings
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
lady
the
duchess
sent
off
a
messenger
with
thy
suit
and
another
*NL*
present
to
thy
wife
Teresa
Panza
;
we
expect
the
answer
every
moment
.
I
*NL*
have
been
a
little
indisposed
through
a
certain
scratching
I
came
in
for
,
*NL*
not
very
much
to
the
benefit
of
my
nose
;
but
it
was
nothing
;
for
if
there
*NL*
are
enchanters
who
maltreat
me
,
there
are
also
some
who
defend
me
.
Let
me
*NL*
know
if
the
majordomo
who
is
with
thee
had
any
share
in
the
Trifaldi
*NL*
performance
,
as
thou
didst
suspect
;
and
keep
me
informed
of
everything
*NL*
that
happens
thee
,
as
the
distance
is
so
short
;
all
the
more
as
I
am
*NL*
thinking
of
giving
over
very
shortly
this
idle
life
I
am
now
leading
,
for
*NL*
I
was
not
born
for
it
.
A
thing
has
occurred
to
me
which
I
am
inclined
to
*NL*
think
will
put
me
out
of
favour
with
the
duke
and
duchess
;
but
though
I
*NL*
am
sorry
for
it
I
do
not
care
,
for
after
all
I
must
obey
my
calling
*NL*
rather
than
their
pleasure
,
in
accordance
with
the
common
saying
,
amicus
*NL*
Plato
,
sed
magis
amica
veritas
.
I
quote
this
Latin
to
thee
because
I
*NL*
conclude
that
since
thou
hast
been
a
governor
thou
wilt
have
learned
it
.
*NL*
Adieu
;
God
keep
thee
from
being
an
object
of
pity
to
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thy
friend
,
DON
QUIXOTE
OF
LA
MANCHA
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
listened
to
the
letter
with
great
attention
,
and
it
was
praised
*NL*
and
considered
wise
by
all
who
heard
it
;
he
then
rose
up
from
table
,
and
*NL*
calling
his
secretary
shut
himself
in
with
him
in
his
own
room
,
and
*NL*
without
putting
it
off
any
longer
set
about
answering
his
master
Don
*NL*
Quixote
at
once
;
and
he
bade
the
secretary
write
down
what
he
told
him
*NL*
without
adding
or
suppressing
anything
,
which
he
did
,
and
the
answer
was
*NL*
to
the
following
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SANCHO
PANZA
'S
LETTER
TO
DON
QUIXOTE
OF
LA
MANCHA
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pressure
of
business
is
so
great
upon
me
that
I
have
no
time
to
*NL*
scratch
my
head
or
even
to
cut
my
nails
;
and
I
have
them
so
long-God
send
*NL*
a
remedy
for
it
.
I
say
this
,
master
of
my
soul
,
that
you
may
not
be
*NL*
surprised
if
I
have
not
until
now
sent
you
word
of
how
I
fare
,
well
or
*NL*
ill
,
in
this
government
,
in
which
I
am
suffering
more
hunger
than
when
we
*NL*
two
were
wandering
through
the
woods
and
wastes
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
lord
the
duke
wrote
to
me
the
other
day
to
warn
me
that
certain
spies
*NL*
had
got
into
this
island
to
kill
me
;
but
up
to
the
present
I
have
not
*NL*
found
out
any
except
a
certain
doctor
who
receives
a
salary
in
this
town
*NL*
for
killing
all
the
governors
that
come
here
;
he
is
called
Doctor
Pedro
*NL*
Recio
,
and
is
from
Tirteafuera
;
so
you
see
what
a
name
he
has
to
make
me
*NL*
dread
dying
under
his
hands
.
This
doctor
says
of
himself
that
he
does
not
*NL*
cure
diseases
when
there
are
any
,
but
prevents
them
coming
,
and
the
*NL*
medicines
he
uses
are
diet
and
more
diet
until
he
brings
one
down
to
bare
*NL*
bones
;
as
if
leanness
was
not
worse
than
fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
he
is
killing
me
with
hunger
,
and
I
am
dying
myself
of
vexation
;
*NL*
for
when
I
thought
I
was
coming
to
this
government
to
get
my
meat
hot
and
*NL*
my
drink
cool
,
and
take
my
ease
between
holland
sheets
on
feather
beds
,
I
*NL*
find
I
have
come
to
do
penance
as
if
I
was
a
hermit
;
and
as
I
do
n't
do
it
*NL*
willingly
I
suspect
that
in
the
end
the
devil
will
carry
me
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
I
have
not
handled
any
dues
or
taken
any
bribes
,
and
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
think
of
it
;
for
here
they
tell
me
that
the
governors
that
come
*NL*
to
this
island
,
before
entering
it
have
plenty
of
money
either
given
to
*NL*
them
or
lent
to
them
by
the
people
of
the
town
,
and
that
this
is
the
*NL*
usual
custom
not
only
here
but
with
all
who
enter
upon
governments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Last
night
going
the
rounds
I
came
upon
a
fair
damsel
in
man
's
clothes
,
*NL*
and
a
brother
of
hers
dressed
as
a
woman
;
my
head-carver
has
fallen
in
*NL*
love
with
the
girl
,
and
has
in
his
own
mind
chosen
her
for
a
wife
,
so
he
*NL*
says
,
and
I
have
chosen
the
youth
for
a
son-in-law
;
to-day
we
are
going
to
*NL*
explain
our
intentions
to
the
father
of
the
pair
,
who
is
one
Diego
de
la
*NL*
Llana
,
a
gentleman
and
an
old
Christian
as
much
as
you
please
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
visited
the
market-places
,
as
your
worship
advises
me
,
and
*NL*
yesterday
I
found
a
stall-keeper
selling
new
hazel
nuts
and
proved
her
to
*NL*
have
mixed
a
bushel
of
old
empty
rotten
nuts
with
a
bushel
of
new
;
I
*NL*
confiscated
the
whole
for
the
children
of
the
charity-school
,
who
will
*NL*
know
how
to
distinguish
them
well
enough
,
and
I
sentenced
her
not
to
come
*NL*
into
the
market-place
for
a
fortnight
;
they
told
me
I
did
bravely
.
I
can
*NL*
tell
your
worship
it
is
commonly
said
in
this
town
that
there
are
no
*NL*
people
worse
than
the
market-women
,
for
they
are
all
barefaced
,
*NL*
unconscionable
,
and
impudent
,
and
I
can
well
believe
it
from
what
I
have
*NL*
seen
of
them
in
other
towns
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
very
glad
my
lady
the
duchess
has
written
to
my
wife
Teresa
Panza
*NL*
and
sent
her
the
present
your
worship
speaks
of
;
and
I
will
strive
to
*NL*
show
myself
grateful
when
the
time
comes
;
kiss
her
hands
for
me
,
and
tell
*NL*
her
I
say
she
has
not
thrown
it
into
a
sack
with
a
hole
in
it
,
as
she
*NL*
will
see
in
the
end
.
I
should
not
like
your
worship
to
have
any
*NL*
difference
with
my
lord
and
lady
;
for
if
you
fall
out
with
them
it
is
*NL*
plain
it
must
do
me
harm
;
and
as
you
give
me
advice
to
be
grateful
it
*NL*
will
not
do
for
your
worship
not
to
be
so
yourself
to
those
who
have
*NL*
shown
you
such
kindness
,
and
by
whom
you
have
been
treated
so
hospitably
*NL*
in
their
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
about
the
scratching
I
do
n't
understand
;
but
I
suppose
it
must
be
*NL*
one
of
the
ill-turns
the
wicked
enchanters
are
always
doing
your
worship
;
*NL*
when
we
meet
I
shall
know
all
about
it
.
I
wish
I
could
send
your
worship
*NL*
something
;
but
I
do
n't
know
what
to
send
,
unless
it
be
some
very
curious
*NL*
clyster
pipes
,
to
work
with
bladders
,
that
they
make
in
this
island
;
but
*NL*
if
the
office
remains
with
me
I
'll
find
out
something
to
send
,
one
way
or
*NL*
another
.
If
my
wife
Teresa
Panza
writes
to
me
,
pay
the
postage
and
send
*NL*
me
the
letter
,
for
I
have
a
very
great
desire
to
hear
how
my
house
and
*NL*
wife
and
children
are
going
on
.
And
so
,
may
God
deliver
your
worship
from
*NL*
evil-minded
enchanters
,
and
bring
me
well
and
peacefully
out
of
this
*NL*
government
,
which
I
doubt
,
for
I
expect
to
take
leave
of
it
and
my
life
*NL*
together
,
from
the
way
Doctor
Pedro
Recio
treats
me
.

Your

SANCHO
PANZA
THE
GOVERNOR
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
secretary
sealed
the
letter
,
and
immediately
dismissed
the
courier
;
*NL*
and
those
who
were
carrying
on
the
joke
against
Sancho
putting
their
*NL*
heads
together
arranged
how
he
was
to
be
dismissed
from
the
government
.
*NL*
Sancho
spent
the
afternoon
in
drawing
up
certain
ordinances
relating
to
*NL*
the
good
government
of
what
he
fancied
the
island
;
and
he
ordained
that
*NL*
there
were
to
be
no
provision
hucksters
in
the
State
,
and
that
men
might
*NL*
import
wine
into
it
from
any
place
they
pleased
,
provided
they
declared
*NL*
the
quarter
it
came
from
,
so
that
a
price
might
be
put
upon
it
according
*NL*
to
its
quality
,
reputation
,
and
the
estimation
it
was
held
in
;
and
he
*NL*
that
watered
his
wine
,
or
changed
the
name
,
was
to
forfeit
his
life
for
*NL*
it
.
He
reduced
the
prices
of
all
manner
of
shoes
,
boots
,
and
stockings
,
*NL*
but
of
shoes
in
particular
,
as
they
seemed
to
him
to
run
extravagantly
*NL*
high
.
He
established
a
fixed
rate
for
servants
'
wages
,
which
were
*NL*
becoming
recklessly
exorbitant
.
He
laid
extremely
heavy
penalties
upon
*NL*
those
who
sang
lewd
or
loose
songs
either
by
day
or
night
.
He
decreed
*NL*
that
no
blind
man
should
sing
of
any
miracle
in
verse
,
unless
he
could
*NL*
produce
authentic
evidence
that
it
was
true
,
for
it
was
his
opinion
that
*NL*
most
of
those
the
blind
men
sing
are
trumped
up
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
*NL*
true
ones
.
He
established
and
created
an
alguacil
of
the
poor
,
not
to
*NL*
harass
them
,
but
to
examine
them
and
see
whether
they
really
were
so
;
for
*NL*
many
a
sturdy
thief
or
drunkard
goes
about
under
cover
of
a
make-believe
*NL*
crippled
limb
or
a
sham
sore
.
In
a
word
,
he
made
so
many
good
rules
that
*NL*
to
this
day
they
are
preserved
there
,
and
are
called
The
constitutions
of
*NL*
the
great
governor
Sancho
Panza

leading
in
the
castle
was
entirely
inconsistent
*NL*
with
the
order
of
chivalry
he
professed
,
so
he
determined
to
ask
the
duke
*NL*
and
duchess
to
permit
him
to
take
his
departure
for
Saragossa
,
as
the
*NL*
time
of
the
festival
was
now
drawing
near
,
and
he
hoped
to
win
there
the
*NL*
suit
of
armour
which
is
the
prize
at
festivals
of
the
sort
.
But
one
day
*NL*
at
table
with
the
duke
and
duchess
,
just
as
he
was
about
to
carry
his
*NL*
resolution
into
effect
and
ask
for
their
permission
,
lo
and
behold
*NL*
suddenly
there
came
in
through
the
door
of
the
great
hall
two
women
,
as
*NL*
they
afterwards
proved
to
be
,
draped
in
mourning
from
head
to
foot
,
one
*NL*
of
whom
approaching
Don
Quixote
flung
herself
at
full
length
at
his
feet
,
*NL*
pressing
her
lips
to
them
,
and
uttering
moans
so
sad
,
so
deep
,
and
so
*NL*
doleful
that
she
put
all
who
heard
and
saw
her
into
a
state
of
*NL*
perplexity
;
and
though
the
duke
and
duchess
supposed
it
must
be
some
joke
*NL*
their
servants
were
playing
off
upon
Don
Quixote
,
still
the
earnest
way
*NL*
the
woman
sighed
and
moaned
and
wept
puzzled
them
and
made
them
feel
*NL*
uncertain
,
until
Don
Quixote
,
touched
with
compassion
,
raised
her
up
and
*NL*
made
her
unveil
herself
and
remove
the
mantle
from
her
tearful
face
.
She
*NL*
complied
and
disclosed
what
no
one
could
have
ever
anticipated
,
for
she
*NL*
disclosed
the
countenance
of
Dona
Rodriguez
,
the
duenna
of
the
house
;
the
*NL*
other
female
in
mourning
being
her
daughter
,
who
had
been
made
a
fool
of
*NL*
by
the
rich
farmer
's
son
.
All
who
knew
her
were
filled
with
astonishment
,
*NL*
and
the
duke
and
duchess
more
than
any
;
for
though
they
thought
her
a
*NL*
simpleton
and
a
weak
creature
,
they
did
not
think
her
capable
of
crazy
*NL*
pranks
.
Dona
Rodriguez
,
at
length
,
turning
to
her
master
and
mistress
*NL*
said
to
them
,
``
Will
your
excellences
be
pleased
to
permit
me
to
speak
to
*NL*
this
gentleman
for
a
moment
,
for
it
is
requisite
I
should
do
so
in
order
*NL*
to
get
successfully
out
of
the
business
in
which
the
boldness
of
an
*NL*
evil-minded
clown
has
involved
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
said
that
for
his
part
he
gave
her
leave
,
and
that
she
might
*NL*
speak
with
Senor
Don
Quixote
as
much
as
she
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
,
turning
to
Don
Quixote
and
addressing
herself
to
him
said
,
*NL*
``
Some
days
since
,
valiant
knight
,
I
gave
you
an
account
of
the
injustice
*NL*
and
treachery
of
a
wicked
farmer
to
my
dearly
beloved
daughter
,
the
*NL*
unhappy
damsel
here
before
you
,
and
you
promised
me
to
take
her
part
and
*NL*
right
the
wrong
that
has
been
done
her
;
but
now
it
has
come
to
my
hearing
*NL*
that
you
are
about
to
depart
from
this
castle
in
quest
of
such
fair
*NL*
adventures
as
God
may
vouchsafe
to
you
;
therefore
,
before
you
take
the
*NL*
road
,
I
would
that
you
challenge
this
froward
rustic
,
and
compel
him
to
*NL*
marry
my
daughter
in
fulfillment
of
the
promise
he
gave
her
to
become
her
*NL*
husband
before
he
seduced
her
;
for
to
expect
that
my
lord
the
duke
will
*NL*
do
me
justice
is
to
ask
pears
from
the
elm
tree
,
for
the
reason
I
stated
*NL*
privately
to
your
worship
;
and
so
may
our
Lord
grant
you
good
health
and
*NL*
forsake
us
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
these
words
Don
Quixote
replied
very
gravely
and
solemnly
,
``
Worthy
*NL*
duenna
,
check
your
tears
,
or
rather
dry
them
,
and
spare
your
sighs
,
for
I
*NL*
take
it
upon
myself
to
obtain
redress
for
your
daughter
,
for
whom
it
*NL*
would
have
been
better
not
to
have
been
so
ready
to
believe
lovers
'
*NL*
promises
,
which
are
for
the
most
part
quickly
made
and
very
slowly
*NL*
performed
;
and
so
,
with
my
lord
the
duke
's
leave
,
I
will
at
once
go
in
*NL*
quest
of
this
inhuman
youth
,
and
will
find
him
out
and
challenge
him
and
*NL*
slay
him
,
if
so
be
he
refuses
to
keep
his
promised
word
;
for
the
chief
*NL*
object
of
my
profession
is
to
spare
the
humble
and
chastise
the
proud
;
I
*NL*
mean
,
to
help
the
distressed
and
destroy
the
oppressors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
necessity
,
''
said
the
duke
,
``
for
your
worship
to
take
the
*NL*
trouble
of
seeking
out
the
rustic
of
whom
this
worthy
duenna
complains
,
*NL*
nor
is
there
any
necessity
,
either
,
for
asking
my
leave
to
challenge
him
;
*NL*
for
I
admit
him
duly
challenged
,
and
will
take
care
that
he
is
informed
*NL*
of
the
challenge
,
and
accepts
it
,
and
comes
to
answer
it
in
person
to
*NL*
this
castle
of
mine
,
where
I
shall
afford
to
both
a
fair
field
,
observing
*NL*
all
the
conditions
which
are
usually
and
properly
observed
in
such
*NL*
trials
,
and
observing
too
justice
to
both
sides
,
as
all
princes
who
offer
*NL*
a
free
field
to
combatants
within
the
limits
of
their
lordships
are
bound
*NL*
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
with
that
assurance
and
your
highness
's
good
leave
,
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
I
hereby
for
this
once
waive
my
privilege
of
gentle
blood
,
and
*NL*
come
down
and
put
myself
on
a
level
with
the
lowly
birth
of
the
*NL*
wrong-doer
,
making
myself
equal
with
him
and
enabling
him
to
enter
into
*NL*
combat
with
me
;
and
so
,
I
challenge
and
defy
him
,
though
absent
,
on
the
*NL*
plea
of
his
malfeasance
in
breaking
faith
with
this
poor
damsel
,
who
was
*NL*
a
maiden
and
now
by
his
misdeed
is
none
;
and
say
that
he
shall
fulfill
*NL*
the
promise
he
gave
her
to
become
her
lawful
husband
,
or
else
stake
his
*NL*
life
upon
the
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
plucking
off
a
glove
he
threw
it
down
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
*NL*
and
the
duke
picked
it
up
,
saying
,
as
he
had
said
before
,
that
he
*NL*
accepted
the
challenge
in
the
name
of
his
vassal
,
and
fixed
six
days
*NL*
thence
as
the
time
,
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
as
the
place
,
and
for
*NL*
arms
the
customary
ones
of
knights
,
lance
and
shield
and
full
armour
,
*NL*
with
all
the
other
accessories
,
without
trickery
,
guile
,
or
charms
of
any
*NL*
sort
,
and
examined
and
passed
by
the
judges
of
the
field
.
``
But
first
of
*NL*
all
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
is
requisite
that
this
worthy
duenna
and
unworthy
*NL*
damsel
should
place
their
claim
for
justice
in
the
hands
of
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
for
otherwise
nothing
can
be
done
,
nor
can
the
said
challenge
be
brought
*NL*
to
a
lawful
issue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
so
place
it
,
''
replied
the
duenna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
too
,
''
added
her
daughter
,
all
in
tears
and
covered
with
shame
and
*NL*
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
declaration
having
been
made
,
and
the
duke
having
settled
in
his
own
*NL*
mind
what
he
would
do
in
the
matter
,
the
ladies
in
black
withdrew
,
and
*NL*
the
duchess
gave
orders
that
for
the
future
they
were
not
to
be
treated
*NL*
as
servants
of
hers
,
but
as
lady
adventurers
who
came
to
her
house
to
*NL*
demand
justice
;
so
they
gave
them
a
room
to
themselves
and
waited
on
them
*NL*
as
they
would
on
strangers
,
to
the
consternation
of
the
other
*NL*
women-servants
,
who
did
not
know
where
the
folly
and
imprudence
of
Dona
*NL*
Rodriguez
and
her
unlucky
daughter
would
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
to
complete
the
enjoyment
of
the
feast
and
bring
the
dinner
to
a
*NL*
satisfactory
end
,
lo
and
behold
the
page
who
had
carried
the
letters
and
*NL*
presents
to
Teresa
Panza
,
the
wife
of
the
governor
Sancho
,
entered
the
*NL*
hall
;
and
the
duke
and
duchess
were
very
well
pleased
to
see
him
,
being
*NL*
anxious
to
know
the
result
of
his
journey
;
but
when
they
asked
him
the
*NL*
page
said
in
reply
that
he
could
not
give
it
before
so
many
people
or
in
*NL*
a
few
words
,
and
begged
their
excellences
to
be
pleased
to
let
it
wait
*NL*
for
a
private
opportunity
,
and
in
the
meantime
amuse
themselves
with
*NL*
these
letters
;
and
taking
out
the
letters
he
placed
them
in
the
duchess
's
*NL*
hand
.
One
bore
by
way
of
address
,
Letter
for
my
lady
the
Duchess
*NL*
So-and-so
,
of
I
do
n't
know
where
;
and
the
other
To
my
husband
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
,
governor
of
the
island
of
Barataria
,
whom
God
prosper
longer
than
*NL*
me
.
The
duchess
's
bread
would
not
bake
,
as
the
saying
is
,
until
she
had
*NL*
read
her
letter
;
and
having
looked
over
it
herself
and
seen
that
it
might
*NL*
be
read
aloud
for
the
duke
and
all
present
to
hear
,
she
read
out
as
*NL*
follows

*NL*
*NL*
TERESA
PANZA
'S
LETTER
TO
THE
DUCHESS
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
your
highness
wrote
me
,
my
lady
,
gave
me
great
pleasure
,
for
*NL*
indeed
I
found
it
very
welcome
.
The
string
of
coral
beads
is
very
fine
,
*NL*
and
my
husband
's
hunting
suit
does
not
fall
short
of
it
.
All
this
village
*NL*
is
very
much
pleased
that
your
ladyship
has
made
a
governor
of
my
good
*NL*
man
Sancho
;
though
nobody
will
believe
it
,
particularly
the
curate
,
and
*NL*
Master
Nicholas
the
barber
,
and
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
;
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
for
that
,
for
so
long
as
it
is
true
,
as
it
is
,
they
may
all
say
what
*NL*
they
like
;
though
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
if
the
coral
beads
and
the
suit
had
*NL*
not
come
I
would
not
have
believed
it
either
;
for
in
this
village
*NL*
everybody
thinks
my
husband
a
numskull
,
and
except
for
governing
a
flock
*NL*
of
goats
,
they
can
not
fancy
what
sort
of
government
he
can
be
fit
for
.
*NL*
God
grant
it
,
and
direct
him
according
as
he
sees
his
children
stand
in
*NL*
need
of
it
.
I
am
resolved
with
your
worship
's
leave
,
lady
of
my
soul
,
to
*NL*
make
the
most
of
this
fair
day
,
and
go
to
Court
to
stretch
myself
at
ease
*NL*
in
a
coach
,
and
make
all
those
I
have
envying
me
already
burst
their
eyes
*NL*
out
;
so
I
beg
your
excellence
to
order
my
husband
to
send
me
a
small
*NL*
trifle
of
money
,
and
to
let
it
be
something
to
speak
of
,
because
one
's
*NL*
expenses
are
heavy
at
the
Court
;
for
a
loaf
costs
a
real
,
and
meat
thirty
*NL*
maravedis
a
pound
,
which
is
beyond
everything
;
and
if
he
does
not
want
me
*NL*
to
go
let
him
tell
me
in
time
,
for
my
feet
are
on
the
fidgets
to
be
off
;
*NL*
and
my
friends
and
neighbours
tell
me
that
if
my
daughter
and
I
make
a
*NL*
figure
and
a
brave
show
at
Court
,
my
husband
will
come
to
be
known
far
*NL*
more
by
me
than
I
by
him
,
for
of
course
plenty
of
people
will
ask
,
``
Who
*NL*
are
those
ladies
in
that
coach
?
''
and
some
servant
of
mine
will
answer
,
*NL*
``
The
wife
and
daughter
of
Sancho
Panza
,
governor
of
the
island
of
*NL*
Barataria
;
''
and
in
this
way
Sancho
will
become
known
,
and
I
'll
be
thought
*NL*
well
of
,
and
``
to
Rome
for
everything
.
''
I
am
as
vexed
as
vexed
can
be
that
*NL*
they
have
gathered
no
acorns
this
year
in
our
village
;
for
all
that
I
*NL*
send
your
highness
about
half
a
peck
that
I
went
to
the
wood
to
gather
*NL*
and
pick
out
one
by
one
myself
,
and
I
could
find
no
bigger
ones
;
I
wish
*NL*
they
were
as
big
as
ostrich
eggs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
not
your
high
mightiness
forget
to
write
to
me
;
and
I
will
take
care
*NL*
to
answer
,
and
let
you
know
how
I
am
,
and
whatever
news
there
may
be
in
*NL*
this
place
,
where
I
remain
,
praying
our
Lord
to
have
your
highness
in
his
*NL*
keeping
and
not
to
forget
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancha
my
daughter
,
and
my
son
,
kiss
your
worship
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
who
would
rather
see
your
ladyship
than
write
to
you
,
*NL*
*NL*
Your
servant

TERESA
PANZA
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
greatly
amused
by
Teresa
Panza
's
letter
,
but
particularly
the
*NL*
duke
and
duchess
;
and
the
duchess
asked
Don
Quixote
's
opinion
whether
*NL*
they
might
open
the
letter
that
had
come
for
the
governor
,
which
she
*NL*
suspected
must
be
very
good
.
Don
Quixote
said
that
to
gratify
them
he
*NL*
would
open
it
,
and
did
so
,
and
found
that
it
ran
as
follows
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
TERESA
PANZA
'S
LETTER
TO
HER
HUSBAND
SANCHO
PANZA
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
thy
letter
,
Sancho
of
my
soul
,
and
I
promise
thee
and
swear
as
a
*NL*
Catholic
Christian
that
I
was
within
two
fingers
'
breadth
of
going
mad
I
*NL*
was
so
happy
.
I
can
tell
thee
,
brother
,
when
I
came
to
hear
that
thou
*NL*
wert
a
governor
I
thought
I
should
have
dropped
dead
with
pure
joy
;
and
*NL*
thou
knowest
they
say
sudden
joy
kills
as
well
as
great
sorrow
;
and
as
*NL*
for
Sanchica
thy
daughter
,
she
leaked
from
sheer
happiness
.
I
had
before
*NL*
me
the
suit
thou
didst
send
me
,
and
the
coral
beads
my
lady
the
duchess
*NL*
sent
me
round
my
neck
,
and
the
letters
in
my
hands
,
and
there
was
the
*NL*
bearer
of
them
standing
by
,
and
in
spite
of
all
this
I
verily
believed
*NL*
and
thought
that
what
I
saw
and
handled
was
all
a
dream
;
for
who
could
*NL*
have
thought
that
a
goatherd
would
come
to
be
a
governor
of
islands
?
Thou
*NL*
knowest
,
my
friend
,
what
my
mother
used
to
say
,
that
one
must
live
long
*NL*
to
see
much
;
I
say
it
because
I
expect
to
see
more
if
I
live
longer
;
for
*NL*
I
do
n't
expect
to
stop
until
I
see
thee
a
farmer
of
taxes
or
a
collector
*NL*
of
revenue
,
which
are
offices
where
,
though
the
devil
carries
off
those
*NL*
who
make
a
bad
use
of
them
,
still
they
make
and
handle
money
.
My
lady
the
*NL*
duchess
will
tell
thee
the
desire
I
have
to
go
to
the
Court
;
consider
the
*NL*
matter
and
let
me
know
thy
pleasure
;
I
will
try
to
do
honour
to
thee
by
*NL*
going
in
a
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
the
curate
,
nor
the
barber
,
nor
the
bachelor
,
nor
even
the
*NL*
sacristan
,
can
believe
that
thou
art
a
governor
,
and
they
say
the
whole
*NL*
thing
is
a
delusion
or
an
enchantment
affair
,
like
everything
belonging
*NL*
to
thy
master
Don
Quixote
;
and
Samson
says
he
must
go
in
search
of
thee
*NL*
and
drive
the
government
out
of
thy
head
and
the
madness
out
of
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
skull
;
I
only
laugh
,
and
look
at
my
string
of
beads
,
and
plan
*NL*
out
the
dress
I
am
going
to
make
for
our
daughter
out
of
thy
suit
.
I
sent
*NL*
some
acorns
to
my
lady
the
duchess
;
I
wish
they
had
been
gold
.
Send
me
*NL*
some
strings
of
pearls
if
they
are
in
fashion
in
that
island
.
Here
is
the
*NL*
news
of
the
village
;
La
Berrueca
has
married
her
daughter
to
a
*NL*
good-for-nothing
painter
,
who
came
here
to
paint
anything
that
might
turn
*NL*
up
.
The
council
gave
him
an
order
to
paint
his
Majesty
's
arms
over
the
*NL*
door
of
the
town-hall
;
he
asked
two
ducats
,
which
they
paid
him
in
*NL*
advance
;
he
worked
for
eight
days
,
and
at
the
end
of
them
had
nothing
*NL*
painted
,
and
then
said
he
had
no
turn
for
painting
such
trifling
things
;
*NL*
he
returned
the
money
,
and
for
all
that
has
married
on
the
pretence
of
*NL*
being
a
good
workman
;
to
be
sure
he
has
now
laid
aside
his
paint-brush
*NL*
and
taken
a
spade
in
hand
,
and
goes
to
the
field
like
a
gentleman
.
Pedro
*NL*
Lobo
's
son
has
received
the
first
orders
and
tonsure
,
with
the
intention
*NL*
of
becoming
a
priest
.
Minguilla
,
Mingo
Silvato
's
granddaughter
,
found
it
*NL*
out
,
and
has
gone
to
law
with
him
on
the
score
of
having
given
her
*NL*
promise
of
marriage
.
Evil
tongues
say
she
is
with
child
by
him
,
but
he
*NL*
denies
it
stoutly
.
There
are
no
olives
this
year
,
and
there
is
not
a
drop
*NL*
of
vinegar
to
be
had
in
the
whole
village
.
A
company
of
soldiers
passed
*NL*
through
here
;
when
they
left
they
took
away
with
them
three
of
the
girls
*NL*
of
the
village
;
I
will
not
tell
thee
who
they
are
;
perhaps
they
will
come
*NL*
back
,
and
they
will
be
sure
to
find
those
who
will
take
them
for
wives
*NL*
with
all
their
blemishes
,
good
or
bad
.
Sanchica
is
making
bonelace
;
she
*NL*
earns
eight
maravedis
a
day
clear
,
which
she
puts
into
a
moneybox
as
a
*NL*
help
towards
house
furnishing
;
but
now
that
she
is
a
governor
's
daughter
*NL*
thou
wilt
give
her
a
portion
without
her
working
for
it
.
The
fountain
in
*NL*
the
plaza
has
run
dry
.
A
flash
of
lightning
struck
the
gibbet
,
and
I
wish
*NL*
they
all
lit
there
.
I
look
for
an
answer
to
this
,
and
to
know
thy
mind
*NL*
about
my
going
to
the
Court
;
and
so
,
God
keep
thee
longer
than
me
,
or
as
*NL*
long
,
for
I
would
not
leave
thee
in
this
world
without
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thy
wife
,
*NL*
*NL*
TERESA
PANZA
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
letters
were
applauded
,
laughed
over
,
relished
,
and
admired
;
and
*NL*
then
,
as
if
to
put
the
seal
to
the
business
,
the
courier
arrived
,
*NL*
bringing
the
one
Sancho
sent
to
Don
Quixote
,
and
this
,
too
,
was
read
out
,
*NL*
and
it
raised
some
doubts
as
to
the
governor
's
simplicity
.
The
duchess
*NL*
withdrew
to
hear
from
the
page
about
his
adventures
in
Sancho
's
village
,
*NL*
which
he
narrated
at
full
length
without
leaving
a
single
circumstance
*NL*
unmentioned
.
He
gave
her
the
acorns
,
and
also
a
cheese
which
Teresa
had
*NL*
given
him
as
being
particularly
good
and
superior
to
those
of
Tronchon
.
*NL*
The
duchess
received
it
with
greatest
delight
,
in
which
we
will
leave
*NL*
her
,
to
describe
the
end
of
the
government
of
the
great
Sancho
Panza
,
*NL*
flower
and
mirror
of
all
governors
of
islands
.

CHAPTER
LIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
TROUBLOUS
END
AND
TERMINATION
SANCHO
PANZA
'S
GOVERNMENT
CAME
TO
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
fancy
that
in
this
life
anything
belonging
to
it
will
remain
for
ever
*NL*
in
the
same
state
is
an
idle
fancy
;
on
the
contrary
,
in
it
everything
*NL*
seems
to
go
in
a
circle
,
I
mean
round
and
round
.
The
spring
succeeds
the
*NL*
summer
,
the
summer
the
fall
,
the
fall
the
autumn
,
the
autumn
the
winter
,
*NL*
and
the
winter
the
spring
,
and
so
time
rolls
with
never-ceasing
wheel
.
*NL*
Man
's
life
alone
,
swifter
than
time
,
speeds
onward
to
its
end
without
any
*NL*
hope
of
renewal
,
save
it
be
in
that
other
life
which
is
endless
and
*NL*
boundless
.
Thus
saith
Cide
Hamete
the
Mahometan
philosopher
;
for
there
*NL*
are
many
that
by
the
light
of
nature
alone
,
without
the
light
of
faith
,
*NL*
have
a
comprehension
of
the
fleeting
nature
and
instability
of
this
*NL*
present
life
and
the
endless
duration
of
that
eternal
life
we
hope
for
;
*NL*
but
our
author
is
here
speaking
of
the
rapidity
with
which
Sancho
's
*NL*
government
came
to
an
end
,
melted
away
,
disappeared
,
vanished
as
it
were
*NL*
in
smoke
and
shadow
.
For
as
he
lay
in
bed
on
the
night
of
the
seventh
day
*NL*
of
his
government
,
sated
,
not
with
bread
and
wine
,
but
with
delivering
*NL*
judgments
and
giving
opinions
and
making
laws
and
proclamations
,
just
as
*NL*
sleep
,
in
spite
of
hunger
,
was
beginning
to
close
his
eyelids
,
he
heard
*NL*
such
a
noise
of
bell-ringing
and
shouting
that
one
would
have
fancied
the
*NL*
whole
island
was
going
to
the
bottom
.
He
sat
up
in
bed
and
remained
*NL*
listening
intently
to
try
if
he
could
make
out
what
could
be
the
cause
of
*NL*
so
great
an
uproar
;
not
only
,
however
,
was
he
unable
to
discover
what
it
*NL*
was
,
but
as
countless
drums
and
trumpets
now
helped
to
swell
the
din
of
*NL*
the
bells
and
shouts
,
he
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
,
and
filled
with
fear
*NL*
and
terror
;
and
getting
up
he
put
on
a
pair
of
slippers
because
of
the
*NL*
dampness
of
the
floor
,
and
without
throwing
a
dressing
gown
or
anything
*NL*
of
the
kind
over
him
he
rushed
out
of
the
door
of
his
room
,
just
in
time
*NL*
to
see
approaching
along
a
corridor
a
band
of
more
than
twenty
persons
*NL*
with
lighted
torches
and
naked
swords
in
their
hands
,
all
shouting
out
,
*NL*
``
To
arms
,
to
arms
,
senor
governor
,
to
arms
!
The
enemy
is
in
the
island
in
*NL*
countless
numbers
,
and
we
are
lost
unless
your
skill
and
valour
come
to
*NL*
our
support
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Keeping
up
this
noise
,
tumult
,
and
uproar
,
they
came
to
where
Sancho
*NL*
stood
dazed
and
bewildered
by
what
he
saw
and
heard
,
and
as
they
*NL*
approached
one
of
them
called
out
to
him
,
``
Arm
at
once
,
your
lordship
,
if
*NL*
you
would
not
have
yourself
destroyed
and
the
whole
island
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
to
do
with
arming
?
''
said
Sancho
.
``
What
do
I
know
about
arms
*NL*
or
supports
?
Better
leave
all
that
to
my
master
Don
Quixote
,
who
will
*NL*
settle
it
and
make
all
safe
in
a
trice
;
for
I
,
sinner
that
I
am
,
God
help
*NL*
me
,
do
n't
understand
these
scuffles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
senor
governor
,
''
said
another
,
``
what
slackness
of
mettle
this
is
!
*NL*
Arm
yourself
;
here
are
arms
for
you
,
offensive
and
defensive
;
come
out
to
*NL*
the
plaza
and
be
our
leader
and
captain
;
it
falls
upon
you
by
right
,
for
*NL*
you
are
our
governor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arm
me
then
,
in
God
's
name
,
''
said
Sancho
,
and
they
at
once
produced
two
*NL*
large
shields
they
had
come
provided
with
,
and
placed
them
upon
him
over
*NL*
his
shirt
,
without
letting
him
put
on
anything
else
,
one
shield
in
front
*NL*
and
the
other
behind
,
and
passing
his
arms
through
openings
they
had
*NL*
made
,
they
bound
him
tight
with
ropes
,
so
that
there
he
was
walled
and
*NL*
boarded
up
as
straight
as
a
spindle
and
unable
to
bend
his
knees
or
stir
*NL*
a
single
step
.
In
his
hand
they
placed
a
lance
,
on
which
he
leant
to
keep
*NL*
himself
from
falling
,
and
as
soon
as
they
had
him
thus
fixed
they
bade
*NL*
him
march
forward
and
lead
them
on
and
give
them
all
courage
;
for
with
*NL*
him
for
their
guide
and
lamp
and
morning
star
,
they
were
sure
to
bring
*NL*
their
business
to
a
successful
issue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
to
march
,
unlucky
being
that
I
am
?
''
said
Sancho
,
``
when
I
ca
n't
*NL*
stir
my
knee-caps
,
for
these
boards
I
have
bound
so
tight
to
my
body
*NL*
wo
n't
let
me
.
What
you
must
do
is
carry
me
in
your
arms
,
and
lay
me
*NL*
across
or
set
me
upright
in
some
postern
,
and
I
'll
hold
it
either
with
*NL*
this
lance
or
with
my
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
,
senor
governor
!
''
cried
another
,
``
it
is
fear
more
than
the
boards
*NL*
that
keeps
you
from
moving
;
make
haste
,
stir
yourself
,
for
there
is
no
*NL*
time
to
lose
;
the
enemy
is
increasing
in
numbers
,
the
shouts
grow
louder
,
*NL*
and
the
danger
is
pressing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Urged
by
these
exhortations
and
reproaches
the
poor
governor
made
an
*NL*
attempt
to
advance
,
but
fell
to
the
ground
with
such
a
crash
that
he
*NL*
fancied
he
had
broken
himself
all
to
pieces
.
There
he
lay
like
a
tortoise
*NL*
enclosed
in
its
shell
,
or
a
side
of
bacon
between
two
kneading-troughs
,
*NL*
or
a
boat
bottom
up
on
the
beach
;
nor
did
the
gang
of
jokers
feel
any
*NL*
compassion
for
him
when
they
saw
him
down
;
so
far
from
that
,
*NL*
extinguishing
their
torches
they
began
to
shout
afresh
and
to
renew
the
*NL*
calls
to
arms
with
such
energy
,
trampling
on
poor
Sancho
,
and
slashing
at
*NL*
him
over
the
shield
with
their
swords
in
such
a
way
that
,
if
he
had
not
*NL*
gathered
himself
together
and
made
himself
small
and
drawn
in
his
head
*NL*
between
the
shields
,
it
would
have
fared
badly
with
the
poor
governor
,
*NL*
as
,
squeezed
into
that
narrow
compass
,
he
lay
,
sweating
and
sweating
*NL*
again
,
and
commending
himself
with
all
his
heart
to
God
to
deliver
him
*NL*
from
his
present
peril
.
Some
stumbled
over
him
,
others
fell
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
one
there
was
who
took
up
a
position
on
top
of
him
for
some
time
,
and
*NL*
from
thence
as
if
from
a
watchtower
issued
orders
to
the
troops
,
shouting
*NL*
out
,
``
Here
,
our
side
!
Here
the
enemy
is
thickest
!
Hold
the
breach
there
!
*NL*
Shut
that
gate
!
Barricade
those
ladders
!
Here
with
your
stink-pots
of
*NL*
pitch
and
resin
,
and
kettles
of
boiling
oil
!
Block
the
streets
with
*NL*
feather
beds
!
''
In
short
,
in
his
ardour
he
mentioned
every
little
thing
,
*NL*
and
every
implement
and
engine
of
war
by
means
of
which
an
assault
upon
a
*NL*
city
is
warded
off
,
while
the
bruised
and
battered
Sancho
,
who
heard
and
*NL*
suffered
all
,
was
saying
to
himself
,
``
O
if
it
would
only
please
the
Lord
*NL*
to
let
the
island
be
lost
at
once
,
and
I
could
see
myself
either
dead
or
*NL*
out
of
this
torture
!
''
Heaven
heard
his
prayer
,
and
when
he
least
expected
*NL*
it
he
heard
voices
exclaiming
,
``
Victory
,
victory
!
The
enemy
retreats
*NL*
beaten
!
Come
,
senor
governor
,
get
up
,
and
come
and
enjoy
the
victory
,
and
*NL*
divide
the
spoils
that
have
been
won
from
the
foe
by
the
might
of
that
*NL*
invincible
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lift
me
up
,
''
said
the
wretched
Sancho
in
a
woebegone
voice
.
They
helped
*NL*
him
to
rise
,
and
as
soon
as
he
was
on
his
feet
said
,
``
The
enemy
I
have
*NL*
beaten
you
may
nail
to
my
forehead
;
I
do
n't
want
to
divide
the
spoils
of
*NL*
the
foe
,
I
only
beg
and
entreat
some
friend
,
if
I
have
one
,
to
give
me
a
*NL*
sup
of
wine
,
for
I
'm
parched
with
thirst
,
and
wipe
me
dry
,
for
I
'm
*NL*
turning
to
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rubbed
him
down
,
fetched
him
wine
and
unbound
the
shields
,
and
he
*NL*
seated
himself
upon
his
bed
,
and
with
fear
,
agitation
,
and
fatigue
he
*NL*
fainted
away
.
Those
who
had
been
concerned
in
the
joke
were
now
sorry
*NL*
they
had
pushed
it
so
far
;
however
,
the
anxiety
his
fainting
away
had
*NL*
caused
them
was
relieved
by
his
returning
to
himself
.
He
asked
what
*NL*
o'clock
it
was
;
they
told
him
it
was
just
daybreak
.
He
said
no
more
,
and
*NL*
in
silence
began
to
dress
himself
,
while
all
watched
him
,
waiting
to
see
*NL*
what
the
haste
with
which
he
was
putting
on
his
clothes
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
himself
dressed
at
last
,
and
then
,
slowly
,
for
he
was
sorely
*NL*
bruised
and
could
not
go
fast
,
he
proceeded
to
the
stable
,
followed
by
*NL*
all
who
were
present
,
and
going
up
to
Dapple
embraced
him
and
gave
him
a
*NL*
loving
kiss
on
the
forehead
,
and
said
to
him
,
not
without
tears
in
his
*NL*
eyes
,
``
Come
along
,
comrade
and
friend
and
partner
of
my
toils
and
*NL*
sorrows
;
when
I
was
with
you
and
had
no
cares
to
trouble
me
except
*NL*
mending
your
harness
and
feeding
your
little
carcass
,
happy
were
my
*NL*
hours
,
my
days
,
and
my
years
;
but
since
I
left
you
,
and
mounted
the
*NL*
towers
of
ambition
and
pride
,
a
thousand
miseries
,
a
thousand
troubles
,
*NL*
and
four
thousand
anxieties
have
entered
into
my
soul
;
''
and
all
the
while
*NL*
he
was
speaking
in
this
strain
he
was
fixing
the
pack-saddle
on
the
ass
,
*NL*
without
a
word
from
anyone
.
Then
having
Dapple
saddled
,
he
,
with
great
*NL*
pain
and
difficulty
,
got
up
on
him
,
and
addressing
himself
to
the
*NL*
majordomo
,
the
secretary
,
the
head-carver
,
and
Pedro
Recio
the
doctor
and
*NL*
several
others
who
stood
by
,
he
said
,
``
Make
way
,
gentlemen
,
and
let
me
go
*NL*
back
to
my
old
freedom
;
let
me
go
look
for
my
past
life
,
and
raise
myself
*NL*
up
from
this
present
death
.
I
was
not
born
to
be
a
governor
or
protect
*NL*
islands
or
cities
from
the
enemies
that
choose
to
attack
them
.
Ploughing
*NL*
and
digging
,
vinedressing
and
pruning
,
are
more
in
my
way
than
defending
*NL*
provinces
or
kingdoms
.
`
Saint
Peter
is
very
well
at
Rome
;
I
mean
each
of
*NL*
us
is
best
following
the
trade
he
was
born
to
.
A
reaping-hook
fits
my
*NL*
hand
better
than
a
governor
's
sceptre
;
I
'd
rather
have
my
fill
of
*NL*
gazpacho
'
than
be
subject
to
the
misery
of
a
meddling
doctor
who
*NL*
tortures
me
with
hunger
,
and
I
'd
rather
lie
in
summer
under
the
shade
of
*NL*
an
oak
,
and
in
winter
wrap
myself
in
a
double
sheepskin
jacket
in
*NL*
freedom
,
than
go
to
bed
between
holland
sheets
and
dress
in
sables
under
*NL*
the
restraint
of
a
government
.
God
be
with
your
worships
,
and
tell
my
*NL*
lord
the
duke
that
`
naked
I
was
born
,
naked
I
find
myself
,
I
neither
*NL*
lose
nor
gain
;
'
I
mean
that
without
a
farthing
I
came
into
this
*NL*
government
,
and
without
a
farthing
I
go
out
of
it
,
very
different
from
*NL*
the
way
governors
commonly
leave
other
islands
.
Stand
aside
and
let
me
*NL*
go
;
I
have
to
plaster
myself
,
for
I
believe
every
one
of
my
ribs
is
*NL*
crushed
,
thanks
to
the
enemies
that
have
been
trampling
over
me
*NL*
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
unnecessary
,
senor
governor
,
''
said
Doctor
Recio
,
``
for
I
will
*NL*
give
your
worship
a
draught
against
falls
and
bruises
that
will
soon
make
*NL*
you
as
sound
and
strong
as
ever
;
and
as
for
your
diet
I
promise
your
*NL*
worship
to
behave
better
,
and
let
you
eat
plentifully
of
whatever
you
*NL*
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spoke
late
,
''
said
Sancho
.
``
I
'd
as
soon
turn
Turk
as
stay
any
longer

*NL*
Those
jokes
wo
n't
pass
a
second
time
.
By
God
I
'd
as
soon
remain
in
this
*NL*
government
,
or
take
another
,
even
if
it
was
offered
me
between
two
*NL*
plates
,
as
fly
to
heaven
without
wings
.
I
am
of
the
breed
of
the
Panzas

*NL*
and
they
are
every
one
of
them
obstinate
,
and
if
they
once
say
`

'
*NL*
odds
it
must
be
,
no
matter
if
it
is
evens
,
in
spite
of
all
the
world

*NL*
Here
in
this
stable
I
leave
the
ant
's
wings
that
lifted
me
up
into
the
*NL*
air
for
the
swifts
and
other
birds
to
eat
me
,

let
's
take
to
level
*NL*
ground

our
feet
once
more
;
and
if
they
're
not
shod
in
pinked
shoes
of
*NL*
cordovan
,
they
wo
n't
want
for
rough
sandals
of
hemp
;
`
every
ewe
to
her
*NL*
like
,
'
`
and
let
no
one
stretch
his
leg
beyond
the
length
of
the
sheet
;
'
*NL*
and
now
let
me
pass
,
for
it
's
growing
late
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
majordomo
said
,
``
Senor
governor
,
we
would
let
your
worship
go
*NL*
with
all
our
hearts
,
though
it
sorely
grieves
us
to
lose
you
,
for
your
*NL*
wit
and
Christian
conduct
naturally
make
us
regret
you
;
but
it
is
well
*NL*
known
that
every
governor
,
before
he
leaves
the
place
where
he
has
been
*NL*
governing
,
is
bound
first
of
all
to
render
an
account
.
Let
your
worship
*NL*
do
so
for
the
ten
days
you
have
held
the
government
,
and
then
you
may
go
*NL*
and
the
peace
of
God
go
with
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
can
demand
it
of
me
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
he
whom
my
lord
the
duke
*NL*
shall
appoint
;
I
am
going
to
meet
him
,

to
him
I
will
render
an
exact
*NL*
one
;
besides
,
when
I
go
forth
naked
as
I
do
,
there
is
no
other
proof
*NL*
needed
to
show
that
I
have
governed
like
an
angel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
the
great
Sancho
is
right
,
''
said
Doctor
Recio
,
``
and
we
should
let
*NL*
him
go
,
for
the
duke
will
be
beyond
measure
glad
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
agreed
to
this
,
and
allowed
him
to
go
,
first
offering
to
bear
*NL*
him
company
and
furnish
him
with
all
he
wanted
for
his
own
comfort
or
for
*NL*
the
journey
.
Sancho
said
he
did
not
want
anything
more
than
a
little
*NL*
barley
for
Dapple
,
and
half
a
cheese
and
half
a
loaf
for
himself
;
for
the
*NL*
distance
being
so
short
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
better
or
bulkier
*NL*
provant
.
They
all
embraced
him
,
and
he
with
tears
embraced
all
of
them
,
*NL*
and
left
them
filled
with
admiration
not
only
at
his
remarks
but
at
his
*NL*
firm
and
sensible
resolution

CHAPTER
LIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
DEALS
WITH
MATTERS
RELATING
TO
THIS
HISTORY
AND
NO
OTHER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
and
duchess
resolved
that
the
challenge
Don
Quixote
had
,
for
the
*NL*
reason
already
mentioned
,
given
their
vassal
,
should
be
proceeded
with
;
*NL*
and
as
the
young
man
was
in
Flanders
,
whither
he
had
fled
to
escape
*NL*
having
Dona
Rodriguez
for
a
mother-in-law
,
they
arranged
to
substitute
*NL*
for
him
a
Gascon
lacquey
,
named
Tosilos
,
first
of
all
carefully
*NL*
instructing
him
in
all
he
had
to
do
.
Two
days
later
the
duke
told
Don
*NL*
Quixote
that
in
four
days
from
that
time
his
opponent
would
present
*NL*
himself
on
the
field
of
battle
armed
as
a
knight
,
and
would
maintain
that
*NL*
the
damsel
lied
by
half
a
beard
,
nay
a
whole
beard
,
if
she
affirmed
that
*NL*
he
had
given
her
a
promise
of
marriage
.
Don
Quixote
was
greatly
pleased
*NL*
at
the
news
,
and
promised
himself
to
do
wonders
in
the
lists
,
and
*NL*
reckoned
it
rare
good
fortune
that
an
opportunity
should
have
offered
for
*NL*
letting
his
noble
hosts
see
what
the
might
of
his
strong
arm
was
capable
*NL*
of
;
and
so
in
high
spirits
and
satisfaction
he
awaited
the
expiration
of
*NL*
the
four
days
,
which
measured
by
his
impatience
seemed
spinning
*NL*
themselves
out
into
four
hundred
ages
.
Let
us
leave
them
to
pass
as
we
do
*NL*
other
things
,
and
go
and
bear
Sancho
company
,
as
mounted
on
Dapple
,
half
*NL*
glad
,
half
sad
,
he
paced
along
on
his
road
to
join
his
master
,
in
whose
*NL*
society
he
was
happier
than
in
being
governor
of
all
the
islands
in
the
*NL*
world
.
Well
then
,
it
so
happened
that
before
he
had
gone
a
great
way
from
*NL*
the
island
of
his
government
-LRB-
and
whether
it
was
island
,
city
,
town
,
or
*NL*
village
that
he
governed
he
never
troubled
himself
to
inquire
-RRB-
he
saw
*NL*
coming
along
the
road
he
was
travelling
six
pilgrims
with
staves
,
*NL*
foreigners
of
that
sort
that
beg
for
alms
singing
;
who
as
they
drew
near
*NL*
arranged
themselves
in
a
line
and
lifting
up
their
voices
all
together
*NL*
began
to
sing
in
their
own
language
something
that
Sancho
could
not
with
*NL*
the
exception
of
one
word
which
sounded
plainly
``
alms
,
''
from
which
he
*NL*
gathered
that
it
was
alms
they
asked
for
in
their
song
;
and
being
,
as
*NL*
Cide
Hamete
says
,
remarkably
charitable
,
he
took
out
of
his
alforias
the
*NL*
half
loaf
and
half
cheese
he
had
been
provided
with
,
and
gave
them
to
*NL*
them
,
explaining
to
them
by
signs
that
he
had
nothing
else
to
give
them
.
*NL*
They
received
them
very
gladly
,
but
exclaimed
,
``
Geld
!
Geld
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
what
you
want
of
me
,
good
people
,
''
said
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
one
of
them
took
a
purse
out
of
his
bosom
and
showed
it
to
*NL*
Sancho
,
by
which
he
comprehended
they
were
asking
for
money
,
and
putting
*NL*
his
thumb
to
his
throat
and
spreading
his
hand
upwards
he
gave
them
to
*NL*
understand
that
he
had
not
the
sign
of
a
coin
about
him
,
and
urging
*NL*
Dapple
forward
he
broke
through
them
.
But
as
he
was
passing
,
one
of
them
*NL*
who
had
been
examining
him
very
closely
rushed
towards
him
,
and
flinging
*NL*
his
arms
round
him
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
and
good
Spanish
,
``
God
bless
*NL*
me
!
What
's
this
I
see
?
Is
it
possible
that
I
hold
in
my
arms
my
dear
*NL*
friend
,
my
good
neighbour
Sancho
Panza
?
But
there
's
no
doubt
about
it
,
*NL*
for
I
'm
not
asleep
,
nor
am
I
drunk
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
surprised
to
hear
himself
called
by
his
name
and
find
himself
*NL*
embraced
by
a
foreign
pilgrim
,
and
after
regarding
him
steadily
without
*NL*
speaking
he
was
still
unable
to
recognise
him
;
but
the
pilgrim
perceiving
*NL*
his
perplexity
cried
,
``
What
!
and
is
it
possible
,
Sancho
Panza
,
that
thou
*NL*
dost
not
know
thy
neighbour
Ricote
,
the
Morisco
shopkeeper
of
thy
*NL*
village
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
upon
this
looking
at
him
more
carefully
began
to
recall
his
*NL*
features
,
and
at
last
recognised
him
perfectly
,
and
without
getting
off
*NL*
the
ass
threw
his
arms
round
his
neck
saying
,
``
Who
the
devil
could
have
*NL*
known
thee
,
Ricote
,
in
this
mummer
's
dress
thou
art
in
?
Tell
me
,
who
has
*NL*
frenchified
thee
,
and
how
dost
thou
dare
to
return
to
Spain
,
where
if
*NL*
they
catch
thee
and
recognise
thee
it
will
go
hard
enough
with
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
thou
dost
not
betray
me
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
pilgrim
,
``
I
am
safe
;
for
*NL*
in
this
dress
no
one
will
recognise
me
;
but
let
us
turn
aside
out
of
the
*NL*
road
into
that
grove
there
where
my
comrades
are
going
to
eat
and
rest
,
*NL*
and
thou
shalt
eat
with
them
there
,
for
they
are
very
good
fellows
;
I
'll
*NL*
have
time
enough
to
tell
thee
then
all
that
has
happened
me
since
I
left
*NL*
our
village
in
obedience
to
his
Majesty
's
edict
that
threatened
such
*NL*
severities
against
the
unfortunate
people
of
my
nation
,
as
thou
hast
*NL*
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
complied
,
and
Ricote
having
spoken
to
the
other
pilgrims
they
*NL*
withdrew
to
the
grove
they
saw
,
turning
a
considerable
distance
out
of
*NL*
the
road
.
They
threw
down
their
staves
,
took
off
their
pilgrim
's
cloaks
*NL*
and
remained
in
their
under-clothing
;
they
were
all
good-looking
young
*NL*
fellows
,
except
Ricote
,
who
was
a
man
somewhat
advanced
in
years
.
They
*NL*
carried
alforjas
all
of
them
,
and
all
apparently
well
filled
,
at
least
*NL*
with
things
provocative
of
thirst
,
such
as
would
summon
it
from
two
*NL*
leagues
off
.
They
stretched
themselves
on
the
ground
,
and
making
a
*NL*
tablecloth
of
the
grass
they
spread
upon
it
bread
,
salt
,
knives
,
walnut
,
*NL*
scraps
of
cheese
,
and
well-picked
ham-bones
which
if
they
were
past
*NL*
gnawing
were
not
past
sucking
.
They
also
put
down
a
black
dainty
called
,
*NL*
they
say
,
caviar
,
and
made
of
the
eggs
of
fish
,
a
great
thirst-wakener
.
*NL*
Nor
was
there
any
lack
of
olives
,
dry
,
it
is
true
,
and
without
any
*NL*
seasoning
,
but
for
all
that
toothsome
and
pleasant
.
But
what
made
the
*NL*
best
show
in
the
field
of
the
banquet
was
half
a
dozen
botas
of
wine
,
for
*NL*
each
of
them
produced
his
own
from
his
alforjas
;
even
the
good
Ricote
,
*NL*
who
from
a
Morisco
had
transformed
himself
into
a
German
or
Dutchman
,
*NL*
took
out
his
,
which
in
size
might
have
vied
with
the
five
others
.
They
*NL*
then
began
to
eat
with
very
great
relish
and
very
leisurely
,
making
the
*NL*
most
of
each
morsel
--
very
small
ones
of
everything
--
they
took
up
on
the
*NL*
point
of
the
knife
;
and
then
all
at
the
same
moment
raised
their
arms
and
*NL*
botas
aloft
,
the
mouths
placed
in
their
mouths
,
and
all
eyes
fixed
on
*NL*
heaven
just
as
if
they
were
taking
aim
at
it
;
and
in
this
attitude
they
*NL*
remained
ever
so
long
,
wagging
their
heads
from
side
to
side
as
if
in
*NL*
acknowledgment
of
the
pleasure
they
were
enjoying
while
they
decanted
the
*NL*
bowels
of
the
bottles
into
their
own
stomachs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
beheld
all
,
``
and
nothing
gave
him
pain
;
''
so
far
from
that
,
acting
*NL*
on
the
proverb
he
knew
so
well
,
``
when
thou
art
at
Rome
do
as
thou
seest
,
''
*NL*
he
asked
Ricote
for
his
bota
and
took
aim
like
the
rest
of
them
,
and
with
*NL*
not
less
enjoyment
.
Four
times
did
the
botas
bear
being
uplifted
,
but
the
*NL*
fifth
it
was
all
in
vain
,
for
they
were
drier
and
more
sapless
than
a
*NL*
rush
by
that
time
,
which
made
the
jollity
that
had
been
kept
up
so
far
*NL*
begin
to
flag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
now
and
then
some
one
of
them
would
grasp
Sancho
's
right
hand
in
*NL*
his
own
saying
,
``
Espanoli
y
Tudesqui
tuto
uno
:
bon
compano
;
''
and
Sancho
*NL*
would
answer
,
``
Bon
compano
,
jur
a
Di
!
''
and
then
go
off
into
a
fit
of
*NL*
laughter
that
lasted
an
hour
,
without
a
thought
for
the
moment
of
*NL*
anything
that
had
befallen
him
in
his
government
;
for
cares
have
very
*NL*
little
sway
over
us
while
we
are
eating
and
drinking
.
At
length
,
the
wine
*NL*
having
come
to
an
end
with
them
,
drowsiness
began
to
come
over
them
,
and
*NL*
they
dropped
asleep
on
their
very
table
and
tablecloth
.
Ricote
and
Sancho
*NL*
alone
remained
awake
,
for
they
had
eaten
more
and
drunk
less
,
and
Ricote
*NL*
drawing
Sancho
aside
,
they
seated
themselves
at
the
foot
of
a
beech
,
*NL*
leaving
the
pilgrims
buried
in
sweet
sleep
;
and
without
once
falling
into
*NL*
his
own
Morisco
tongue
Ricote
spoke
as
follows
in
pure
Castilian
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
knowest
well
,
neighbour
and
friend
Sancho
Panza
,
how
the
*NL*
proclamation
or
edict
his
Majesty
commanded
to
be
issued
against
those
of
*NL*
my
nation
filled
us
all
with
terror
and
dismay
;
me
at
least
it
did
,
*NL*
insomuch
that
I
think
before
the
time
granted
us
for
quitting
Spain
was
*NL*
out
,
the
full
force
of
the
penalty
had
already
fallen
upon
me
and
upon
my
*NL*
children
.
I
decided
,
then
,
and
I
think
wisely
-LRB-
just
like
one
who
knows
*NL*
that
at
a
certain
date
the
house
he
lives
in
will
be
taken
from
him
,
and
*NL*
looks
out
beforehand
for
another
to
change
into
-RRB-
,
I
decided
,
I
say
,
to
*NL*
leave
the
town
myself
,
alone
and
without
my
family
,
and
go
to
seek
out
*NL*
some
place
to
remove
them
to
comfortably
and
not
in
the
hurried
way
in
*NL*
which
the
others
took
their
departure
;
for
I
saw
very
plainly
,
and
so
did
*NL*
all
the
older
men
among
us
,
that
the
proclamations
were
not
mere
threats
,
*NL*
as
some
said
,
but
positive
enactments
which
would
be
enforced
at
the
*NL*
appointed
time
;
and
what
made
me
believe
this
was
what
I
knew
of
the
base
*NL*
and
extravagant
designs
which
our
people
harboured
,
designs
of
such
a
*NL*
nature
that
I
think
it
was
a
divine
inspiration
that
moved
his
Majesty
to
*NL*
carry
out
a
resolution
so
spirited
;
not
that
we
were
all
guilty
,
for
some
*NL*
there
were
true
and
steadfast
Christians
;
but
they
were
so
few
that
they
*NL*
could
make
no
head
against
those
who
were
not
;
and
it
was
not
prudent
to
*NL*
cherish
a
viper
in
the
bosom
by
having
enemies
in
the
house
.
In
short
it
*NL*
was
with
just
cause
that
we
were
visited
with
the
penalty
of
banishment
,
*NL*
a
mild
and
lenient
one
in
the
eyes
of
some
,
but
to
us
the
most
terrible
*NL*
that
could
be
inflicted
upon
us
.
Wherever
we
are
we
weep
for
Spain
;
for
*NL*
after
all
we
were
born
there
and
it
is
our
natural
fatherland
.
Nowhere
do
*NL*
we
find
the
reception
our
unhappy
condition
needs
;
and
in
Barbary
and
all
*NL*
the
parts
of
Africa
where
we
counted
upon
being
received
,
succoured
,
and
*NL*
welcomed
,
it
is
there
they
insult
and
ill-treat
us
most
.
We
knew
not
our
*NL*
good
fortune
until
we
lost
it
;
and
such
is
the
longing
we
almost
all
of
*NL*
us
have
to
return
to
Spain
,
that
most
of
those
who
like
myself
know
the
*NL*
language
,
and
there
are
many
who
do
,
come
back
to
it
and
leave
their
*NL*
wives
and
children
forsaken
yonder
,
so
great
is
their
love
for
it
;
and
*NL*
now
I
know
by
experience
the
meaning
of
the
saying
,
sweet
is
the
love
of
*NL*
one
's
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
our
village
,
as
I
said
,
and
went
to
France
,
but
though
they
gave
*NL*
us
a
kind
reception
there
I
was
anxious
to
see
all
I
could
.
I
crossed
*NL*
into
Italy
,
and
reached
Germany
,
and
there
it
seemed
to
me
we
might
live
*NL*
with
more
freedom
,
as
the
inhabitants
do
not
pay
any
attention
to
*NL*
trifling
points
;
everyone
lives
as
he
likes
,
for
in
most
parts
they
enjoy
*NL*
liberty
of
conscience
.
I
took
a
house
in
a
town
near
Augsburg
,
and
then
*NL*
joined
these
pilgrims
,
who
are
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
Spain
in
great
*NL*
numbers
every
year
to
visit
the
shrines
there
,
which
they
look
upon
as
*NL*
their
Indies
and
a
sure
and
certain
source
of
gain
.
They
travel
nearly
*NL*
all
over
it
,
and
there
is
no
town
out
of
which
they
do
not
go
full
up
of
*NL*
meat
and
drink
,
as
the
saying
is
,
and
with
a
real
,
at
least
,
in
money
,
*NL*
and
they
come
off
at
the
end
of
their
travels
with
more
than
a
hundred
*NL*
crowns
saved
,
which
,
changed
into
gold
,
they
smuggle
out
of
the
kingdom
*NL*
either
in
the
hollow
of
their
staves
or
in
the
patches
of
their
pilgrim
's
*NL*
cloaks
or
by
some
device
of
their
own
,
and
carry
to
their
own
country
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
guards
at
the
posts
and
passes
where
they
are
searched
.
Now
*NL*
my
purpose
is
,
Sancho
,
to
carry
away
the
treasure
that
I
left
buried
,
*NL*
which
,
as
it
is
outside
the
town
,
I
shall
be
able
to
do
without
risk
,
and
*NL*
to
write
,
or
cross
over
from
Valencia
,
to
my
daughter
and
wife
,
who
I
*NL*
know
are
at
Algiers
,
and
find
some
means
of
bringing
them
to
some
French
*NL*
port
and
thence
to
Germany
,
there
to
await
what
it
may
be
God
's
will
to
*NL*
do
with
us
;
for
,
after
all
,
Sancho
,
I
know
well
that
Ricota
my
daughter
*NL*
and
Francisca
Ricota
my
wife
are
Catholic
Christians
,
and
though
I
am
not
*NL*
so
much
so
,
still
I
am
more
of
a
Christian
than
a
Moor
,
and
it
is
always
*NL*
my
prayer
to
God
that
he
will
open
the
eyes
of
my
understanding
and
show
*NL*
me
how
I
am
to
serve
him
;
but
what
amazes
me
and
I
can
not
understand
is
*NL*
why
my
wife
and
daughter
should
have
gone
to
Barbary
rather
than
to
*NL*
France
,
where
they
could
live
as
Christians
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Sancho
replied
,
``
Remember
,
Ricote
,
that
may
not
have
been
open
to
*NL*
them
,
for
Juan
Tiopieyo
thy
wife
's
brother
took
them
,
and
being
a
true
*NL*
Moor
he
went
where
he
could
go
most
easily
;
and
another
thing
I
can
tell
*NL*
thee
,
it
is
my
belief
thou
art
going
in
vain
to
look
for
what
thou
hast
*NL*
left
buried
,
for
we
heard
they
took
from
thy
brother-in-law
and
thy
wife
*NL*
a
great
quantity
of
pearls
and
money
in
gold
which
they
brought
to
be
*NL*
passed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
,
''
said
Ricote
;
``
but
I
know
they
did
not
touch
my
hoard
,
for
*NL*
I
did
not
tell
them
where
it
was
,
for
fear
of
accidents
;
and
so
,
if
thou
*NL*
wilt
come
with
me
,
Sancho
,
and
help
me
to
take
it
away
and
conceal
it
,
I
*NL*
will
give
thee
two
hundred
crowns
wherewith
thou
mayest
relieve
thy
*NL*
necessities
,
and
,
as
thou
knowest
,
I
know
they
are
many
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
do
it
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
I
am
not
at
all
covetous
,
for
I
gave
*NL*
up
an
office
this
morning
in
which
,
if
I
was
,
I
might
have
made
the
walls
*NL*
of
my
house
of
gold
and
dined
off
silver
plates
before
six
months
were
*NL*
over
;
and
so
for
this
reason
,
and
because
I
feel
I
would
be
guilty
of
*NL*
treason
to
my
king
if
I
helped
his
enemies
,
I
would
not
go
with
thee
if
*NL*
instead
of
promising
me
two
hundred
crowns
thou
wert
to
give
me
four
*NL*
hundred
here
in
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
office
is
this
thou
hast
given
up
,
Sancho
?
''
asked
Ricote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
given
up
being
governor
of
an
island
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
such
a
*NL*
one
,
faith
,
as
you
wo
n't
find
the
like
of
easily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
this
island
?
''
said
Ricote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
said
Sancho
;
``
two
leagues
from
here
,
and
it
is
called
the
island
*NL*
of
Barataria
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
Sancho
,
''
said
Ricote
;
``
islands
are
away
out
in
the
sea
;
there
*NL*
are
no
islands
on
the
mainland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
No
islands
!
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
tell
thee
,
friend
Ricote
,
I
left
it
*NL*
this
morning
,
and
yesterday
I
was
governing
there
as
I
pleased
like
a
*NL*
sagittarius
;
but
for
all
that
I
gave
it
up
,
for
it
seemed
to
me
a
*NL*
dangerous
office
,
a
governor
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
hast
thou
gained
by
the
government
?
''
asked
Ricote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
gained
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
the
knowledge
that
I
am
no
good
for
*NL*
governing
,
unless
it
is
a
drove
of
cattle
,
and
that
the
riches
that
are
*NL*
to
be
got
by
these
governments
are
got
at
the
cost
of
one
's
rest
and
*NL*
sleep
,
ay
and
even
one
's
food
;
for
in
islands
the
governors
must
eat
*NL*
little
,
especially
if
they
have
doctors
to
look
after
their
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
thee
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Ricote
;
``
but
it
seems
to
me
all
*NL*
nonsense
thou
art
talking
.
Who
would
give
thee
islands
to
govern
?
Is
*NL*
there
any
scarcity
in
the
world
of
cleverer
men
than
thou
art
for
*NL*
governors
?
Hold
thy
peace
,
Sancho
,
and
come
back
to
thy
senses
,
and
*NL*
consider
whether
thou
wilt
come
with
me
as
I
said
to
help
me
to
take
away
*NL*
treasure
I
left
buried
-LRB-
for
indeed
it
may
be
called
a
treasure
,
it
is
so
*NL*
large
-RRB-
,
and
I
will
give
thee
wherewithal
to
keep
thee
,
as
I
told
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
told
thee
already
,
Ricote
,
that
I
will
not
,

said
Sancho
;
*NL*
``
let
it
content
thee
that
by
me
thou
shalt
not
be
betrayed
,
and
go
thy
*NL*
way
in
God
's
name
and
let
me
go
mine
;
for
I
know
that
well-gotten
gain
*NL*
may
be
lost
,
but
ill-gotten
gain
is
lost
,
itself
and
its
owner
likewise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
press
thee
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Ricote
;
``
but
tell
me
,
wert
thou
in
*NL*
our
village
when
my
wife
and
daughter
and
brother-in-law
left
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
so
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
I
can
tell
thee
thy
daughter
left
it
*NL*
looking
so
lovely
that
all
the
village
turned
out
to
see
her
,
and
*NL*
everybody
said
she
was
the
fairest
creature
in
the
world
.
She
wept
as
she
*NL*
went
,
and
embraced
all
her
friends
and
acquaintances
and
those
who
came
*NL*
out
to
see
her
,
and
she
begged
them
all
to
commend
her
to
God
and
Our
*NL*
Lady
his
mother
,
and
this
in
such
a
touching
way
that
it
made
me
weep
*NL*
myself
,
though
I
'm
not
much
given
to
tears
commonly
;
and
,
faith
,
many
a
*NL*
one
would
have
liked
to
hide
her
,
or
go
out
and
carry
her
off
on
the
*NL*
road
;
but
the
fear
of
going
against
the
king
's
command
kept
them
back
.
*NL*
The
one
who
showed
himself
most
moved
was
Don
Pedro
Gregorio
,
the
rich
*NL*
young
heir
thou
knowest
of
,
and
they
say
he
was
deep
in
love
with
her
;
*NL*
and
since
she
left
he
has
not
been
seen
in
our
village
again
,
and
we
all
*NL*
suspect
he
has
gone
after
her
to
steal
her
away
,
but
so
far
nothing
has
*NL*
been
heard
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
had
a
suspicion
that
gentleman
had
a
passion
for
my
daughter
,
''
*NL*
said
Ricote
;
``
but
as
I
felt
sure
of
my
Ricota
's
virtue
it
gave
me
no
*NL*
uneasiness
to
know
that
he
loved
her
;
for
thou
must
have
heard
it
said
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
that
the
Morisco
women
seldom
or
never
engage
in
amours
with
the
*NL*
old
Christians
;
and
my
daughter
,
who
I
fancy
thought
more
of
being
a

Christian
than
of
lovemaking

would
not
trouble
herself
about
the
*NL*
attentions
of
this
heir

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
it
,

said
Sancho
,
``
for
it
would
be
a
bad
business
for
both
of

them
;

now
let
me
be
off

Ricote

and
then
they
both
embraced
,

Sancho
mounted

CHAPTER
LV
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
BEFELL
SANCHO
ON
THE
ROAD
,
AND
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
CAN
NOT
BE
*NL*
SURPASSED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
length
of
time
he
delayed
with
Ricote
prevented
Sancho
from
reaching
*NL*
the
duke
's
castle
that
day
,
though
he
was
within
half
a
league
of
it
when
*NL*
night
,
somewhat
dark
and
cloudy
,
overtook
him
.
This
,
however
,
as
it
was
*NL*
summer
time
,
did
not
give
him
much
uneasiness
,
and
he
turned
aside
out
of
*NL*
the
road
intending
to
wait
for
morning
;
but
his
ill
luck
and
hard
fate
so
*NL*
willed
it
that
as
he
was
searching
about
for
a
place
to
make
himself
as
*NL*
comfortable
as
possible
,
he
and
Dapple
fell
into
a
deep
dark
hole
that
*NL*
lay
among
some
very
old
buildings
.
As
he
fell
he
commended
himself
with
*NL*
all
his
heart
to
God
,
fancying
he
was
not
going
to
stop
until
he
reached
*NL*
the
depths
of
the
bottomless
pit
;
but
it
did
not
turn
out
so
,
for
at
*NL*
little
more
than
thrice
a
man
's
height
Dapple
touched
bottom
,
and
he
*NL*
found
himself
sitting
on
him
without
having
received
any
hurt
or
damage
*NL*
whatever
.
He
felt
himself
all
over
and
held
his
breath
to
try
whether
he
*NL*
was
quite
sound
or
had
a
hole
made
in
him
anywhere
,
and
finding
himself
*NL*
all
right
and
whole
and
in
perfect
health
he
was
profuse
in
his
thanks
to
*NL*
God
our
Lord
for
the
mercy
that
had
been
shown
him
,
for
he
made
sure
he
*NL*
had
been
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
.
He
also
felt
along
the
sides
of
*NL*
the
pit
with
his
hands
to
see
if
it
were
possible
to
get
out
of
it
*NL*
without
help
,
but
he
found
they
were
quite
smooth
and
afforded
no
hold
*NL*
anywhere
,
at
which
he
was
greatly
distressed
,
especially
when
he
heard
*NL*
how
pathetically
and
dolefully
Dapple
was
bemoaning
himself
,
and
no
*NL*
wonder
he
complained
,
nor
was
it
from
ill-temper
,
for
in
truth
he
was
not
*NL*
in
a
very
good
case
.
``
Alas
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
what
unexpected
accidents
*NL*
happen
at
every
step
to
those
who
live
in
this
miserable
world
!
Who
would
*NL*
have
said
that
one
who
saw
himself
yesterday
sitting
on
a
throne
,
*NL*
governor
of
an
island
,
giving
orders
to
his
servants
and
his
vassals
,
*NL*
would
see
himself
to-day
buried
in
a
pit
without
a
soul
to
help
him
,
or
*NL*
servant
or
vassal
to
come
to
his
relief
?
Here
must
we
perish
with
hunger
,
*NL*
my
ass
and
myself
,
if
indeed
we
do
n't
die
first
,
he
of
his
bruises
and
*NL*
injuries
,
and
I
of
grief
and
sorrow
.
At
any
rate
I
'll
not
be
as
lucky
as
*NL*
my
master
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
when
he
went
down
into
the
cave
of
*NL*
that
enchanted
Montesinos
,
where
he
found
people
to
make
more
of
him
than
*NL*
if
he
had
been
in
his
own
house
;
for
it
seems
he
came
in
for
a
table
laid
*NL*
out
and
a
bed
ready
made
.
There
he
saw
fair
and
pleasant
visions
,
but
*NL*
here
I
'll
see
,
I
imagine
,
toads
and
adders
.
Unlucky
wretch
that
I
am
,
*NL*
what
an
end
my
follies
and
fancies
have
come
to
!
They
'll
take
up
my
bones
*NL*
out
of
this
,
when
it
is
heaven
's
will
that
I
'm
found
,
picked
clean
,
white
*NL*
and
polished
,
and
my
good
Dapple
's
with
them
,
and
by
that
,
perhaps
,
it
*NL*
will
be
found
out
who
we
are
,
at
least
by
such
as
have
heard
that
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
never
separated
from
his
ass
,
nor
his
ass
from
Sancho
Panza
.
*NL*
Unlucky
wretches
,
I
say
again
,
that
our
hard
fate
should
not
let
us
die
*NL*
in
our
own
country
and
among
our
own
people
,
where
if
there
was
no
help
*NL*
for
our
misfortune
,
at
any
rate
there
would
be
some
one
to
grieve
for
it
*NL*
and
to
close
our
eyes
as
we
passed
away
!
O
comrade
and
friend
,
how
ill
*NL*
have
I
repaid
thy
faithful
services
!
Forgive
me
,
and
entreat
Fortune
,
as
*NL*
well
as
thou
canst
,
to
deliver
us
out
of
this
miserable
strait
we
are
*NL*
both
in
;
and
I
promise
to
put
a
crown
of
laurel
on
thy
head
,
and
make
*NL*
thee
look
like
a
poet
laureate
,
and
give
thee
double
feeds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
strain
did
Sancho
bewail
himself
,
and
his
ass
listened
to
him
,
*NL*
but
answered
him
never
a
word
,
such
was
the
distress
and
anguish
the
poor
*NL*
beast
found
himself
in
.
At
length
,
after
a
night
spent
in
bitter
moanings
*NL*
and
lamentations
,
day
came
,
and
by
its
light
Sancho
perceived
that
it
was
*NL*
wholly
impossible
to
escape
out
of
that
pit
without
help
,
and
he
fell
to
*NL*
bemoaning
his
fate
and
uttering
loud
shouts
to
find
out
if
there
was
*NL*
anyone
within
hearing
;
but
all
his
shouting
was
only
crying
in
the
*NL*
wilderness
,
for
there
was
not
a
soul
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
to
*NL*
hear
him
,
and
then
at
last
he
gave
himself
up
for
dead
.
Dapple
was
lying
*NL*
on
his
back
,
and
Sancho
helped
him
to
his
feet
,
which
he
was
scarcely
*NL*
able
to
keep
;
and
then
taking
a
piece
of
bread
out
of
his
alforjas
which
*NL*
had
shared
their
fortunes
in
the
fall
,
he
gave
it
to
the
ass
,
to
whom
it
*NL*
was
not
unwelcome
,
saying
to
him
as
if
he
understood
him
,
``
With
bread
all
*NL*
sorrows
are
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
he
perceived
on
one
side
of
the
pit
a
hole
large
enough
to
admit
*NL*
a
person
if
he
stooped
and
squeezed
himself
into
a
small
compass
.
Sancho
*NL*
made
for
it
,
and
entered
it
by
creeping
,
and
found
it
wide
and
spacious
*NL*
on
the
inside
,
which
he
was
able
to
see
as
a
ray
of
sunlight
that
*NL*
penetrated
what
might
be
called
the
roof
showed
it
all
plainly
.
He
*NL*
observed
too
that
it
opened
and
widened
out
into
another
spacious
cavity
;
*NL*
seeing
which
he
made
his
way
back
to
where
the
ass
was
,
and
with
a
stone
*NL*
began
to
pick
away
the
clay
from
the
hole
until
in
a
short
time
he
had
*NL*
made
room
for
the
beast
to
pass
easily
,
and
this
accomplished
,
taking
him
*NL*
by
the
halter
,
he
proceeded
to
traverse
the
cavern
to
see
if
there
was
*NL*
any
outlet
at
the
other
end
.
He
advanced
,
sometimes
in
the
dark
,
*NL*
sometimes
without
light
,
but
never
without
fear
;
``
God
Almighty
help
me
!
''
*NL*
said
he
to
himself
;
``
this
that
is
a
misadventure
to
me
would
make
a
good
*NL*
adventure
for
my
master
Don
Quixote
.
He
would
have
been
sure
to
take
*NL*
these
depths
and
dungeons
for
flowery
gardens
or
the
palaces
of
Galiana
,
*NL*
and
would
have
counted
upon
issuing
out
of
this
darkness
and
imprisonment
*NL*
into
some
blooming
meadow
;
but
I
,
unlucky
that
I
am
,
hopeless
and
*NL*
spiritless
,
expect
at
every
step
another
pit
deeper
than
the
first
to
*NL*
open
under
my
feet
and
swallow
me
up
for
good
;
`
welcome
evil
,
if
thou
*NL*
comest
alone
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
and
with
these
reflections
he
seemed
to
himself
to
have
*NL*
travelled
rather
more
than
half
a
league
,
when
at
last
he
perceived
a
dim
*NL*
light
that
looked
like
daylight
and
found
its
way
in
on
one
side
,
showing
*NL*
that
this
road
,
which
appeared
to
him
the
road
to
the
other
world
,
led
to
*NL*
some
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Cide
Hamete
leaves
him
,
and
returns
to
Don
Quixote
,
who
in
high
*NL*
spirits
and
satisfaction
was
looking
forward
to
the
day
fixed
for
the
*NL*
battle
he
was
to
fight
with
him
who
had
robbed
Dona
Rodriguez
's
daughter
*NL*
of
her
honour
,
for
whom
he
hoped
to
obtain
satisfaction
for
the
wrong
and
*NL*
injury
shamefully
done
to
her
.
It
came
to
pass
,
then
,
that
having
sallied
*NL*
forth
one
morning
to
practise
and
exercise
himself
in
what
he
would
have
*NL*
to
do
in
the
encounter
he
expected
to
find
himself
engaged
in
the
next
*NL*
day
,
as
he
was
putting
Rocinante
through
his
paces
or
pressing
him
to
the
*NL*
charge
,
he
brought
his
feet
so
close
to
a
pit
that
but
for
reining
him
in
*NL*
tightly
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
avoid
falling
into
it
.
*NL*
He
pulled
him
up
,
however
,
without
a
fall
,
and
coming
a
little
closer
*NL*
examined
the
hole
without
dismounting
;
but
as
he
was
looking
at
it
he
*NL*
heard
loud
cries
proceeding
from
it
,
and
by
listening
attentively
was
*NL*
able
to
make
out
that
he
who
uttered
them
was
saying
,
``
Ho
,
above
there
!
*NL*
is
there
any
Christian
that
hears
me
,
or
any
charitable
gentleman
that
*NL*
will
take
pity
on
a
sinner
buried
alive
,
on
an
unfortunate
disgoverned
*NL*
governor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
Don
Quixote
that
it
was
the
voice
of
Sancho
Panza
he
heard
,
*NL*
whereat
he
was
taken
aback
and
amazed
,
and
raising
his
own
voice
as
much
*NL*
as
he
could
,
he
cried
out
,
``
Who
is
below
there
?
Who
is
that
complaining
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
should
be
here
,
or
who
should
complain
,
''
was
the
answer
,
``
but
the
*NL*
forlorn
Sancho
Panza
,
for
his
sins
and
for
his
ill-luck
governor
of
the
*NL*
island
of
Barataria
,
squire
that
was
to
the
famous
knight
Don
Quixote
of
*NL*
La
Mancha
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Don
Quixote
heard
this
his
amazement
was
redoubled
and
his
*NL*
perturbation
grew
greater
than
ever
,
for
it
suggested
itself
to
his
mind
*NL*
that
Sancho
must
be
dead
,
and
that
his
soul
was
in
torment
down
there
;
*NL*
and
carried
away
by
this
idea
he
exclaimed
,
``
I
conjure
thee
by
everything
*NL*
that
as
a
Catholic
Christian
I
can
conjure
thee
by
,
tell
me
who
thou
art
;
*NL*
and
if
thou
art
a
soul
in
torment
,
tell
me
what
thou
wouldst
have
me
do
*NL*
for
thee
;
for
as
my
profession
is
to
give
aid
and
succour
to
those
that
*NL*
need
it
in
this
world
,
it
will
also
extend
to
aiding
and
succouring
the
*NL*
distressed
of
the
other
,
who
can
not
help
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
answered
the
voice
,
``
your
worship
who
speaks
to
me
must
*NL*
be
my
master
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
;
nay

the
tone
of
the
voice

*NL*
is
plain
it
can
be
nobody

*NL*
*NL*
``
Don

replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
he

profession
it
is

dead
in

*NL*
tell

keeping
me
in
suspense

thou
art
my
squire
Sancho
Panza
,
and
art
dead
,
since
the
devils
have
not

thee
off

thou
art
by
God
's

holy

mother
the
Roman
Catholic

release
thee

pains
thou
art
in

and
I
for
my
part
will
plead
*NL*
with
her
to
that
end
,
so
far
as
my
substance
will
go
;
without
further
*NL*
delay
,
therefore

tell
me
who

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
that
's
good
,
''
was
the
answer
,
``
and
by
the
birth
of
whomsoever
*NL*
your

chooses

I
swear
,
Senor
Don

,
that
I
am
*NL*
your
squire
Sancho
Panza

and
that
I
have
never
died
all
my
life

but
*NL*
that
,
having
given
up
my
government
for
reasons
that
would
require
more
*NL*
time
to
explain
,
I
fell
last
night
into
this
pit
where
I
am
now
,
and
*NL*
Dapple
is
witness
and
wo
n't
let

lie
,
for
more
by

is
here
with
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
this
all
;
one
would
have
fancied
the
ass
understood
what
Sancho
*NL*
said
,
because
that
moment
he
began
to
bray
so
loudly
that
the
whole
cave
*NL*
rang
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Famous
testimony
!
''
exclaimed
Don
Quixote
;
``
I
know
that
bray
as
well
as
*NL*
if
I
was
its
mother
,
and
thy
voice
too
,
my
Sancho
.
Wait
while
I
go
to
the
*NL*
duke
's
castle
,
which
is
close
by
,
and
I
will
bring
some
one
to
take
thee
*NL*
out
of
this
pit
into
which
thy
sins
no
doubt
have
brought
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
your
worship
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
come
back
quick
for
God
's
sake
;
for
*NL*
I
can
not
bear
being
buried
alive
any
longer
,
and
I
'm
dying
of
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
left
him
,
and
hastened
to
the
castle
to
tell
the
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
what
had
happened
Sancho
,
and
they
were
not
a
little
astonished
*NL*
at
it
;
they
could
easily
understand
his
having
fallen
,
from
the
*NL*
confirmatory
circumstance
of
the
cave
which
had
been
in
existence
there
*NL*
from
time
immemorial
;
but
they
could
not
imagine
how
he
had
quitted
the
*NL*
government
without
their
receiving
any
intimation
of
his
coming
.
To
be
*NL*
brief
,
they
fetched
ropes
and
tackle
,
as
the
saying
is
,
and
by
dint
of
*NL*
many
hands
and
much
labour
they
drew
up
Dapple
and
Sancho
Panza
out
of
*NL*
the
darkness
into
the
light
of
day
.
A
student
who
saw
him
remarked
,
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
all
bad
governors
should
come
out
of
their
governments
,
*NL*
as
this
sinner
comes
out
of
the
depths
of
the
pit
,
dead
with
hunger
,
*NL*
pale
,
and
I
suppose
without
a
farthing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
overheard
him
and
said
,
``
It
is
eight
or
ten
days
,
brother
growler
,
*NL*
since
I
entered
upon
the
government
of
the
island
they
gave
me
,
and
all
*NL*
that
time
I
never
had
a
bellyful
of
victuals
,
no
not
for
an
hour
;
doctors
*NL*
persecuted
me
and
enemies
crushed
my
bones
;
nor
had
I
any
opportunity
of
*NL*
taking
bribes
or
levying
taxes
;
and
if
that
be
the
case
,
as
it
is
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
deserve
,
I
think
,
to
come
out
in
this
fashion
;
but
`
man
proposes
*NL*
and
God
disposes
;
'
and
God
knows
what
is
best
,
and
what
suits
each
one
*NL*
best
;
and
`
as
the
occasion
,
so
the
behaviour
;
'
and
`
let
nobody
say
``
I
*NL*
wo
n't
drink
of
this
water
;
''
'
and
`
where
one
thinks
there
are
flitches
,
*NL*
there
are
no
pegs
;
'
God
knows
my
meaning
and
that
's
enough
;
I
say
no
*NL*
more
,
though
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
angry
or
annoyed
at
what
thou
hearest
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
``
or
there
will
never
be
an
end
of
it
;
keep
a
safe
conscience
and
let
them
*NL*
say
what
they
like
;
for
trying
to
stop
slanderers
'
tongues
is
like
trying
*NL*
to
put
gates
to
the
open
plain
.
If
a
governor
comes
out
of
his
government
*NL*
rich
,
they
say
he
has
been
a
thief
;
and
if
he
comes
out
poor
,
that
he
has
*NL*
been
a
noodle
and
a
blockhead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
be
pretty
sure
this
time
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
to
set
me
down
for
a
*NL*
fool
rather
than
a
thief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
talking
,
and
surrounded
by
boys
and
a
crowd
of
people
,
they
reached
*NL*
the
castle
,
where
in
one
of
the
corridors
the
duke
and
duchess
stood
*NL*
waiting
for
them
;
but
Sancho
would
not
go
up
to
see
the
duke
until
he
had
*NL*
first
put
up
Dapple
in
the
stable
,
for
he
said
he
had
passed
a
very
bad
*NL*
night
in
his
last
quarters
;
then
he
went
upstairs
to
see
his
lord
and
*NL*
lady
,
and
kneeling
before
them
he
said
,
``
Because
it
was
your
highnesses
'
*NL*
pleasure
,
not
because
of
any
desert
of
my
own
,
I
went
to
govern
your
*NL*
island
of
Barataria
,
which
'
I
entered
naked
,
and
naked
I
find
myself
;
I
*NL*
neither
lose
nor
gain
.
'
Whether
I
have
governed
well
or
ill
,
I
have
had
*NL*
witnesses
who
will
say
what
they
think
fit
.
I
have
answered
questions
,
I
*NL*
have
decided
causes
,
and
always
dying
of
hunger
,
for
Doctor
Pedro
Recio
*NL*
of
Tirteafuera
,
the
island
and
governor
doctor
,
would
have
it
so
.
Enemies
*NL*
attacked
us
by
night
and
put
us
in
a
great
quandary
,
but
the
people
of
*NL*
the
island
say
they
came
off
safe
and
victorious
by
the
might
of
my
arm
;
*NL*
and
may
God
give
them
as
much
health
as
there
's
truth
in
what
they
say
.
*NL*
In
short
,
during
that
time
I
have
weighed
the
cares
and
responsibilities
*NL*
governing
brings
with
it
,
and
by
my
reckoning
I
find
my
shoulders
ca
n't
*NL*
bear
them
,
nor
are
they
a
load
for
my
loins
or
arrows
for
my
quiver
;
and
*NL*
so
,
before
the
government
threw
me
over
I
preferred
to
throw
the
*NL*
government
over
;
and
yesterday
morning
I
left
the
island
as
I
found
it
,
*NL*
with
the
same
streets
,
houses
,
and
roofs
it
had
when
I
entered
it
.
I
*NL*
asked
no
loan
of
anybody
,
nor
did
I
try
to
fill
my
pocket
;
and
though
I
*NL*
meant
to
make
some
useful
laws
,
I
made
hardly
any
,
as
I
was
afraid
they
*NL*
would
not
be
kept
;
for
in
that
case
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
to
make
*NL*
them
or
not
to
make
them
.
I
quitted
the
island
,
as
I
said
,
without
any
*NL*
escort
except
my
ass
;
I
fell
into
a
pit
,
I
pushed
on
through
it
,
until
*NL*
this
morning
by
the
light
of
the
sun
I
saw
an
outlet
,
but
not
so
easy
a
*NL*
one
but
that
,
had
not
heaven
sent
me
my
master
Don
Quixote
,
I
'd
have
*NL*
stayed
there
till
the
end
of
the
world
.
So
now
my
lord
and
lady
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
,
here
is
your
governor
Sancho
Panza
,
who
in
the
bare
ten
days
he
*NL*
has
held
the
government
has
come
by
the
knowledge
that
he
would
not
give
*NL*
anything
to
be
governor
,
not
to
say
of
an
island
,
but
of
the
whole
world
;
*NL*
and
that
point
being
settled
,
kissing
your
worships
'
feet
,
and
imitating
*NL*
the
game
of
the
boys
when
they
say
,
`
leap
thou
,
and
give
me
one
,
'
I
take
*NL*
a
leap
out
of
the
government
and
pass
into
the
service
of
my
master
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
for
after
all
,
though
in
it
I
eat
my
bread
in
fear
and
*NL*
trembling
,
at
any
rate
I
take
my
fill
;
and
for
my
part
,
so
long
as
I
'm
*NL*
full
,
it
's
all
alike
to
me
whether
it
's
with
carrots
or
with
partridges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Sancho
brought
his
long
speech
to
an
end
,
Don
Quixote
having
been
*NL*
the
whole
time
in
dread
of
his
uttering
a
host
of
absurdities
;
and
when
*NL*
he
found
him
leave
off
with
so
few
,
he
thanked
heaven
in
his
heart
.
The
*NL*
duke
embraced
Sancho
and
told
him
he
was
heartily
sorry
he
had
given
up
*NL*
the
government
so
soon
,
but
that
he
would
see
that
he
was
provided
with
*NL*
some
other
post
on
his
estate
less
onerous
and
more
profitable
.
The
*NL*
duchess
also
embraced
him
,
and
gave
orders
that
he
should
be
taken
good
*NL*
care
of
,
as
it
was
plain
to
see
he
had
been
badly
treated
and
worse
*NL*
bruised
.

CHAPTER
LVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
PRODIGIOUS
AND
UNPARALLELED
BATTLE
THAT
TOOK
PLACE
BETWEEN
DON
*NL*
QUIXOTE
OF
LA
MANCHA
AND
THE
LACQUEY
TOSILOS
IN
DEFENCE
OF
THE
DAUGHTER
*NL*
OF
DONA
RODRIGUEZ
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
and
duchess
had
no
reason
to
regret
the
joke
that
had
been
*NL*
played
upon
Sancho
Panza
in
giving
him
the
government
;
especially
as
*NL*
their
majordomo
returned
the
same
day
,
and
gave
them
a
minute
account
of
*NL*
almost
every
word
and
deed
that
Sancho
uttered
or
did
during
the
time
;
*NL*
and
to
wind
up
with
,
eloquently
described
to
them
the
attack
upon
the
*NL*
island
and
Sancho
's
fright
and
departure
,
with
which
they
were
not
a
*NL*
little
amused
.
After
this
the
history
goes
on
to
say
that
the
day
fixed
*NL*
for
the
battle
arrived
,
and
that
the
duke
,
after
having
repeatedly
*NL*
instructed
his
lacquey
Tosilos
how
to
deal
with
Don
Quixote
so
as
to
*NL*
vanquish
him
without
killing
or
wounding
him
,
gave
orders
to
have
the
*NL*
heads
removed
from
the
lances
,
telling
Don
Quixote
that
Christian
*NL*
charity
,
on
which
he
plumed
himself
,
could
not
suffer
the
battle
to
be
*NL*
fought
with
so
much
risk
and
danger
to
life
;
and
that
he
must
be
content
*NL*
with
the
offer
of
a
battlefield
on
his
territory
-LRB-
though
that
was
against
*NL*
the
decree
of
the
holy
Council
,
which
prohibits
all
challenges
of
the
*NL*
sort
-RRB-
and
not
push
such
an
arduous
venture
to
its
extreme
limits
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
bade
his
excellence
arrange
all
matters
connected
with
the
affair
*NL*
as
he
pleased
,
as
on
his
part
he
would
obey
him
in
everything
.
The
dread
*NL*
day
,
then
,
having
arrived
,
and
the
duke
having
ordered
a
spacious
stand
*NL*
to
be
erected
facing
the
court
of
the
castle
for
the
judges
of
the
field
*NL*
and
the
appellant
duennas
,
mother
and
daughter
,
vast
crowds
flocked
from
*NL*
all
the
villages
and
hamlets
of
the
neighbourhood
to
see
the
novel
*NL*
spectacle
of
the
battle
;
nobody
,
dead
or
alive
,
in
those
parts
having
*NL*
ever
seen
or
heard
of
such
a
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
person
to
enter
the
field
and
the
lists
was
the
master
of
the
*NL*
ceremonies
,
who
surveyed
and
paced
the
whole
ground
to
see
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
unfair
and
nothing
concealed
to
make
the
combatants
stumble
or
*NL*
fall
;
then
the
duennas
entered
and
seated
themselves
,
enveloped
in
*NL*
mantles
covering
their
eyes
,
nay
even
their
bosoms
,
and
displaying
no
*NL*
slight
emotion
as
Don
Quixote
appeared
in
the
lists
.
Shortly
afterwards
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
several
trumpets
and
mounted
on
a
powerful
steed
that
*NL*
threatened
to
crush
the
whole
place
,
the
great
lacquey
Tosilos
made
his
*NL*
appearance
on
one
side
of
the
courtyard
with
his
visor
down
and
stiffly
*NL*
cased
in
a
suit
of
stout
shining
armour
.
The
horse
was
a
manifest
*NL*
Frieslander
,
broad-backed
and
flea-bitten
,
and
with
half
a
hundred
of
*NL*
wool
hanging
to
each
of
his
fetlocks
.
The
gallant
combatant
came
well
*NL*
primed
by
his
master
the
duke
as
to
how
he
was
to
bear
himself
against
*NL*
the
valiant
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
;
being
warned
that
he
must
on
no
*NL*
account
slay
him
,
but
strive
to
shirk
the
first
encounter
so
as
to
avoid
*NL*
the
risk
of
killing
him
,
as
he
was
sure
to
do
if
he
met
him
full
tilt
.
He
*NL*
crossed
the
courtyard
at
a
walk
,
and
coming
to
where
the
duennas
were
*NL*
placed
stopped
to
look
at
her
who
demanded
him
for
a
husband
;
the
marshal
*NL*
of
the
field
summoned
Don
Quixote
,
who
had
already
presented
himself
in
*NL*
the
courtyard
,
and
standing
by
the
side
of
Tosilos
he
addressed
the
*NL*
duennas
,
and
asked
them
if
they
consented
that
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
*NL*
should
do
battle
for
their
right
.
They
said
they
did
,
and
that
whatever
*NL*
he
should
do
in
that
behalf
they
declared
rightly
done
,
final
and
valid
.
*NL*
By
this
time
the
duke
and
duchess
had
taken
their
places
in
a
gallery
*NL*
commanding
the
enclosure
,
which
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
a
*NL*
multitude
of
people
eager
to
see
this
perilous
and
unparalleled
*NL*
encounter
.
The
conditions
of
the
combat
were
that
if
Don
Quixote
proved
*NL*
the
victor
his
antagonist
was
to
marry
the
daughter
of
Dona
Rodriguez
;
*NL*
but
if
he
should
be
vanquished
his
opponent
was
released
from
the
promise
*NL*
that
was
claimed
against
him
and
from
all
obligations
to
give
*NL*
satisfaction
.
The
master
of
the
ceremonies
apportioned
the
sun
to
them
,
*NL*
and
stationed
them
,
each
on
the
spot
where
he
was
to
stand
.
The
drums
*NL*
beat
,
the
sound
of
the
trumpets
filled
the
air
,
the
earth
trembled
under
*NL*
foot
,
the
hearts
of
the
gazing
crowd
were
full
of
anxiety
,
some
hoping
*NL*
for
a
happy
issue
,
some
apprehensive
of
an
untoward
ending
to
the
affair
,
*NL*
and
lastly
,
Don
Quixote
,
commending
himself
with
all
his
heart
to
God
our
*NL*
Lord
and
to
the
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
stood
waiting
for
them
to
give
*NL*
the
necessary
signal
for
the
onset
.
Our
lacquey
,
however
,
was
thinking
of
*NL*
something
very
different
;
he
only
thought
of
what
I
am
now
going
to
*NL*
mention
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
that
as
he
stood
contemplating
his
enemy
she
struck
him
as
the
*NL*
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
seen
all
his
life
;
and
the
little
blind
*NL*
boy
whom
in
our
streets
they
commonly
call
Love
had
no
mind
to
let
slip
*NL*
the
chance
of
triumphing
over
a
lacquey
heart
,
and
adding
it
to
the
list
*NL*
of
his
trophies
;
and
so
,
stealing
gently
upon
him
unseen
,
he
drove
a
dart
*NL*
two
yards
long
into
the
poor
lacquey
's
left
side
and
pierced
his
heart
*NL*
through
and
through
;
which
he
was
able
to
do
quite
at
his
ease
,
for
Love
*NL*
is
invisible
,
and
comes
in
and
goes
out
as
he
likes
,
without
anyone
*NL*
calling
him
to
account
for
what
he
does
.
Well
then
,
when
they
gave
the
*NL*
signal
for
the
onset
our
lacquey
was
in
an
ecstasy
,
musing
upon
the
*NL*
beauty
of
her
whom
he
had
already
made
mistress
of
his
liberty
,
and
so
he
*NL*
paid
no
attention
to
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
,
unlike
Don
Quixote
,
who
*NL*
was
off
the
instant
he
heard
it
,
and
,
at
the
highest
speed
Rocinante
was
*NL*
capable
of
,
set
out
to
meet
his
enemy
,
his
good
squire
Sancho
shouting
*NL*
lustily
as
he
saw
him
start
,
``
God
guide
thee
,
cream
and
flower
of
*NL*
knights-errant
!
God
give
thee
the
victory
,
for
thou
hast
the
right
on
thy
*NL*
side
!
''
But
though
Tosilos
saw
Don
Quixote
coming
at
him
he
never
stirred
*NL*
a
step
from
the
spot
where
he
was
posted
;
and
instead
of
doing
so
called
*NL*
loudly
to
the
marshal
of
the
field
,
to
whom
when
he
came
up
to
see
what
*NL*
he
wanted
he
said
,
``
Senor
,
is
not
this
battle
to
decide
whether
I
marry
*NL*
or
do
not
marry
that
lady
?
''
``
Just
so
,
''
was
the
answer
.
``
Well
then
,
''
said
*NL*
the
lacquey
,
``
I
feel
qualms
of
conscience
,
and
I
should
lay
a-heavy
*NL*
burden
upon
it
if
I
were
to
proceed
any
further
with
the
combat
;
I
*NL*
therefore
declare
that
I
yield
myself
vanquished
,
and
that
I
am
willing
*NL*
to
marry
the
lady
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marshal
of
the
field
was
lost
in
astonishment
at
the
words
of
*NL*
Tosilos
;
and
as
he
was
one
of
those
who
were
privy
to
the
arrangement
of
*NL*
the
affair
he
knew
not
what
to
say
in
reply
.
Don
Quixote
pulled
up
in
mid
*NL*
career
when
he
saw
that
his
enemy
was
not
coming
on
to
the
attack
.
The
*NL*
duke
could
not
make
out
the
reason
why
the
battle
did
not
go
on
;
but
the
*NL*
marshal
of
the
field
hastened
to
him
to
let
him
know
what
Tosilos
said
,
*NL*
and
he
was
amazed
and
extremely
angry
at
it
.
In
the
meantime
Tosilos
*NL*
advanced
to
where
Dona
Rodriguez
sat
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
,
``
Senora
,
I
*NL*
am
willing
to
marry
your
daughter
,
and
I
have
no
wish
to
obtain
by
strife
*NL*
and
fighting
what
I
can
obtain
in
peace
and
without
any
risk
to
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
valiant
Don
Quixote
heard
him
,
and
said
,
``
As
that
is
the
case
I
am
*NL*
released
and
absolved
from
my
promise
;
let
them
marry
by
all
means
,
and
*NL*
as
`
God
our
Lord
has
given
her
,
may
Saint
Peter
add
his
blessing
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
had
now
descended
to
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
,
and
going
up
*NL*
to
Tosilos
he
said
to
him
,
``
Is
it
true
,
sir
knight
,
that
you
yield
*NL*
yourself
vanquished
,
and
that
moved
by
scruples
of
conscience
you
wish
to
*NL*
marry
this
damsel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
senor
,
''
replied
Tosilos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
does
well
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
what
thou
hast
to
give
to
the
*NL*
mouse
,
give
to
the
cat
,
and
it
will
save
thee
all
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tosilos
meanwhile
was
trying
to
unlace
his
helmet
,
and
he
begged
them
to
*NL*
come
to
his
help
at
once
,
as
his
power
of
breathing
was
failing
him
,
and
*NL*
he
could
not
remain
so
long
shut
up
in
that
confined
space
.
They
removed
*NL*
it
in
all
haste
,
and
his
lacquey
features
were
revealed
to
public
gaze
.
*NL*
At
this
sight
Dona
Rodriguez
and
her
daughter
raised
a
mighty
outcry
,
*NL*
exclaiming
,
``
This
is
a
trick
!
This
is
a
trick
!
They
have
put
Tosilos
,
my
*NL*
lord
the
duke
's
lacquey
,
upon
us
in
place
of
the
real
husband
.
The
*NL*
justice
of
God
and
the
king
against
such
trickery
,
not
to
say
roguery
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
distress
yourselves
,
ladies
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
for
this
is
no
*NL*
trickery
or
roguery
;
or
if
it
is
,
it
is
not
the
duke
who
is
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
it
,
but
those
wicked
enchanters
who
persecute
me
,
and
who
,
jealous
of
*NL*
my
reaping
the
glory
of
this
victory
,
have
turned
your
husband
's
features
*NL*
into
those
of
this
person
,
who
you
say
is
a
lacquey
of
the
duke
's
;
take
*NL*
my
advice
,
and
notwithstanding
the
malice
of
my
enemies
marry
him
,
for
*NL*
beyond
a
doubt
he
is
the
one
you
wish
for
a
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
duke
heard
this
all
his
anger
was
near
vanishing
in
a
fit
of
*NL*
laughter
,
and
he
said
,
``
The
things
that
happen
to
Senor
Don
Quixote
are
*NL*
so
extraordinary
that
I
am
ready
to
believe
this
lacquey
of
mine
is
not
*NL*
one
;
but
let
us
adopt
this
plan
and
device
;
let
us
put
off
the
marriage
*NL*
for
,
say
,
a
fortnight
,
and
let
us
keep
this
person
about
whom
we
are
*NL*
uncertain
in
close
confinement
,
and
perhaps
in
the
course
of
that
time
he
*NL*
may
return
to
his
original
shape
;
for
the
spite
which
the
enchanters
*NL*
entertain
against
Senor
Don
Quixote
can
not
last
so
long
,
especially
as
it
*NL*
is
of
so
little
advantage
to
them
to
practise
these
deceptions
and
*NL*
transformations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
those
scoundrels
are
well
used
to
changing
*NL*
whatever
concerns
my
master
from
one
thing
into
another
.
A
knight
that
he
*NL*
overcame
some
time
back
,
called
the
Knight
of
the
Mirrors
,
they
turned
*NL*
into
the
shape
of
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
of
our
town
and
a
great
*NL*
friend
of
ours
;
and
my
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
they
have
turned
into
a
*NL*
common
country
wench
;
so
I
suspect
this
lacquey
will
have
to
live
and
die
*NL*
a
lacquey
all
the
days
of
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
Rodriguez
's
daughter
exclaimed
,
``
Let
him
be
who
he
may
,
this
man
*NL*
that
claims
me
for
a
wife
;
I
am
thankful
to
him
for
the
same
,
for
I
had
*NL*
rather
be
the
lawful
wife
of
a
lacquey
than
the
cheated
mistress
of
a
*NL*
gentleman
;
though
he
who
played
me
false
is
nothing
of
the
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
brief
,
all
the
talk
and
all
that
had
happened
ended
in
Tosilos
*NL*
being
shut
up
until
it
was
seen
how
his
transformation
turned
out
.
All
*NL*
hailed
Don
Quixote
as
victor
,
but
the
greater
number
were
vexed
and
*NL*
disappointed
at
finding
that
the
combatants
they
had
been
so
anxiously
*NL*
waiting
for
had
not
battered
one
another
to
pieces
,
just
as
the
boys
are
*NL*
disappointed
when
the
man
they
are
waiting
to
see
hanged
does
not
come
*NL*
out
,
because
the
prosecution
or
the
court
has
pardoned
him
.
The
people
*NL*
dispersed
,
the
duke
and
Don
Quixote
returned
to
the
castle
,
they
locked
*NL*
up
Tosilos
,
Dona
Rodriguez
and
her
daughter
remained
perfectly
contented
*NL*
when
they
saw
that
any
way
the
affair
must
end
in
marriage
,
and
Tosilos
*NL*
wanted
nothing
else

WHICH
TREATS
OF
HOW
DON
QUIXOTE
TOOK
LEAVE
OF
THE
DUKE
,
AND
OF
WHAT
*NL*
FOLLOWED
WITH
THE
WITTY
AND
IMPUDENT
ALTISIDORA
,
ONE
OF
THE
DUCHESS
'S
*NL*
DAMSELS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
now
felt
it
right
to
quit
a
life
of
such
idleness
as
he
was
*NL*
leading
in
the
castle
;
for
he
fancied
that
he
was
making
himself
sorely
*NL*
missed
by
suffering
himself
to
remain
shut
up
and
inactive
amid
the
*NL*
countless
luxuries
and
enjoyments
his
hosts
lavished
upon
him
as
a
*NL*
knight
,
and
he
felt
too
that
he
would
have
to
render
a
strict
account
to
*NL*
heaven
of
that
indolence
and
seclusion
;
and
so
one
day
he
asked
the
duke
*NL*
and
duchess
to
grant
him
permission
to
take
his
departure
.
They
gave
it
,
*NL*
showing
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
very
sorry
he
was
leaving
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
gave
his
wife
's
letters
to
Sancho
Panza
,
who
shed
tears
over
*NL*
them
,
saying
,
``
Who
would
have
thought
that
such
grand
hopes
as
the
news
*NL*
of
my
government
bred
in
my
wife
Teresa
Panza
's
breast
would
end
in
my
*NL*
going
back
now
to
the
vagabond
adventures
of
my
master
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
?
Still
I
'm
glad
to
see
my
Teresa
behaved
as
she
ought
in
sending
*NL*
the
acorns
,
for
if
she
had
not
sent
them
I
'd
have
been
sorry
,
and
she
'd
*NL*
have
shown
herself
ungrateful
.
It
is
a
comfort
to
me
that
they
ca
n't
call
*NL*
that
present
a
bribe
;
for
I
had
got
the
government
already
when
she
sent
*NL*
them
,
and
it
's
but
reasonable
that
those
who
have
had
a
good
turn
done
*NL*
them
should
show
their
gratitude
,
if
it
's
only
with
a
trifle
.
After
all
I
*NL*
went
into
the
government
naked
,
and
I
come
out
of
it
naked
;
so
I
can
say
*NL*
with
a
safe
conscience
--
and
that
's
no
small
matter
--
`
naked
I
was
born
,
*NL*
naked
I
find
myself
,
I
neither
lose
nor
gain
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
did
Sancho
soliloquise
on
the
day
of
their
departure
,
as
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
had
the
night
before
taken
leave
of
the
duke
and
duchess
,
*NL*
coming
out
made
his
appearance
at
an
early
hour
in
full
armour
in
the
*NL*
courtyard
of
the
castle
.
The
whole
household
of
the
castle
were
watching
*NL*
him
from
the
corridors
,
and
the
duke
and
duchess
,
too
,
came
out
to
see
*NL*
him
.
Sancho
was
mounted
on
his
Dapple
,
with
his
alforjas
,
valise
,
and
*NL*
proven
,
supremely
happy
because
the
duke
's
majordomo
,
the
same
that
had
*NL*
acted
the
part
of
the
Trifaldi
,
had
given
him
a
little
purse
with
two
*NL*
hundred
gold
crowns
to
meet
the
necessary
expenses
of
the
road
,
but
of
*NL*
this
Don
Quixote
knew
nothing
as
yet
.
While
all
were
,
as
has
been
said
,
*NL*
observing
him
,
suddenly
from
among
the
duennas
and
handmaidens
the
*NL*
impudent
and
witty
Altisidora
lifted
up
her
voice
and
said
in
pathetic
*NL*
tones
:
*NL*
*NL*
Give
ear
,
cruel
knight
;
*NL*
Draw
rein
;
where
's
the
need
*NL*
Of
spurring
the
flanks
*NL*
Of
that
ill-broken
steed
?
*NL*
From
what
art
thou
flying
?
*NL*
No
dragon
I
am
,
*NL*
Not
even
a
sheep
,
*NL*
But
a
tender
young
lamb
.
*NL*
Thou
hast
jilted
a
maiden
*NL*
As
fair
to
behold
*NL*
As
nymph
of
Diana
*NL*
Or
Venus
of
old

*NL*
*NL*
Bireno

AEneas

what

shall
I
call
thee
?
*NL*
*NL*
Barabbas
go

All
evil

*NL*
*NL*
In
thy
claws

ruthless
robber

*NL*
Thou
bearest
away
*NL*
The
heart
of
a
meek
*NL*
Loving
maid
for
thy
prey
,
*NL*
Three
kerchiefs
thou
stealest
,
*NL*
And
garters
a
pair
,
*NL*
From
legs
than
the
whitest
*NL*
Of
marble
more
fair
;
*NL*
And
the
sighs
that
pursue
thee
*NL*
Would
burn
to
the
ground
*NL*
Two
thousand
Troy
Towns
,
*NL*
If
so
many
were

Be

May
thy
falsehood
to

Find
its
punishment

her

For
in
my
land
the
just
*NL*
Often
pays
for
the
sinner

May
thy

Discomfitures

May
thy

be
abhorred
*NL*
For
thy
conduct
to
ladies
,
*NL*
From
London
to
England

From
Seville

Thy

seven

When

When

May
it
be
to
the
quick
;
*NL*
When
thy

are
drawn
*NL*
May
the

stick

Bireno

call

*NL*
*NL*
Barabbas
go

*NL*
*NL*
All
the
while
the
unhappy
Altisidora
was
bewailing
herself
in
the
above
*NL*
strain
Don
Quixote
stood
staring
at
her
;
and
without
uttering
a
word
in
*NL*
reply
to
her
he
turned
round
to
Sancho
and
said
,
``
Sancho
my
friend
,
I
*NL*
conjure
thee
by
the
life
of
thy
forefathers
tell
me
the
truth
;
say
,
hast
*NL*
thou
by
any
chance
taken
the
three
kerchiefs
and
the
garters
this
*NL*
love-sick
maid
speaks
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Sancho
made
answer
,
``
The
three
kerchiefs
I
have
;
but
the
garters
,
*NL*
as
much
as
`
over
the
hills
of
Ubeda
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
was
amazed
at
Altisidora
's
assurance
;
she
knew
that
she
was
*NL*
bold
,
lively
,
and
impudent
,
but
not
so
much
so
as
to
venture
to
make
free
*NL*
in
this
fashion
;
and
not
being
prepared
for
the
joke
,
her
astonishment
*NL*
was
all
the
greater
.
The
duke
had
a
mind
to
keep
up
the
sport
,
so
he
*NL*
said
,
``
It
does
not
seem
to
me
well
done
in
you
,
sir
knight
,
that
after
*NL*
having
received
the
hospitality
that
has
been
offered
you
in
this
very
*NL*
castle
,
you
should
have
ventured
to
carry
off
even
three
kerchiefs
,
not
*NL*
to
say
my
handmaid
's
garters
.
It
shows
a
bad
heart
and
does
not
tally
*NL*
with
your
reputation
.
Restore
her
garters
,
or
else
I
defy
you
to
mortal
*NL*
combat
,
for
I
am
not
afraid
of
rascally
enchanters
changing
or
altering
*NL*
my
features
as
they
changed
his
who
encountered
you
into
those
of
my
*NL*
lacquey
,
Tosilos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
I
should
draw
my
sword
against
your
*NL*
illustrious
person
from
which
I
have
received
such
great
favours
.
The
*NL*
kerchiefs
I
will
restore
,
as
Sancho
says
he
has
them
;
as
to
the
garters
*NL*
that
is
impossible
,
for
I
have
not
got
them
,
neither
has
he
;
and
if
your
*NL*
handmaiden
here
will
look
in
her
hiding-places
,
depend
upon
it
she
will
*NL*
find
them

I
have
never
been
a
thief

my
lord
duke

nor
do
I
mean
to
be
*NL*
so
long
as
I
live
,
if
God
cease
not
to
have
me
in
his
keeping
.
This
*NL*
damsel
by
her
own
confession
speaks
as
one
in
love
,
for
which
I
am
not
to
*NL*
blame
,
and
therefore
need
not
ask
pardon
,
either
of
her
or
of
your
*NL*
excellence
,
whom
I
entreat
to
have
a
better
opinion
of
me
,
and
once
more
*NL*
to
give
me
leave
to
pursue
my
journey

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
may
God
so
prosper
it
,
Senor
Don
Quixote

said
the
duchess

``

we
may
always
hear
good
news
of
your
exploits
;
God
speed
you
;
for
the
*NL*
longer
you
stay
,
the
more
you
inflame
the
hearts
of
the
damsels
who
*NL*
behold
you
;
and
as
for
this
one
of
mine
,
I
will
so
chastise
her
that
she
*NL*
will
not
transgress
again
,
either
with
her
eyes
or
with
her
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
and
no
more
,
O
valiant
Don
Quixote
,
I
ask
you
to
hear
,
''
said
*NL*
Altisidora
,
``
and
that
is
that
I
beg
your
pardon
about
the
theft
of
the
*NL*
garters
;
for
by
God
and
upon
my
soul
I
have
got
them
on
,
and
I
have
*NL*
fallen
into
the
same
blunder
as
he
did
who
went
looking
for
his
ass
being
*NL*
all
the
while
mounted
on
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I

so
?

said
Sancho
.
``
I
'm
a
likely
one
to
hide
thefts
!
Why

*NL*
I
wanted
to
deal
in
them

came
ready
enough
to
me
in
my
*NL*
government

*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
bowed
his
head
,
and
saluted
the
duke
and
duchess
and
all
the
*NL*
bystanders
,
and
wheeling
Rocinante
round
,
Sancho
following
him
on
Dapple
,
*NL*
he
rode
out
of

shaping
his
course
for

CHAPTER
LVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
TELLS
HOW
ADVENTURES
CAME
CROWDING
ON
DON
QUIXOTE
IN
SUCH
NUMBERS
*NL*
THAT
THEY
GAVE
ONE
ANOTHER
NO
BREATHING-TIME
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Don
Quixote
saw
himself
in
open
country
,
free
,
and
relieved
from
the
*NL*
attentions
of
Altisidora
,
he
felt
at
his
ease
,
and
in
fresh
spirits
to
*NL*
take
up
the
pursuit
of
chivalry
once
more
;
and
turning
to
Sancho
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Freedom
,
Sancho
,
is
one
of
the
most
precious
gifts
that
heaven
has
*NL*
bestowed
upon
men
;
no
treasures
that
the
earth
holds
buried
or
the
sea
*NL*
conceals
can
compare
with
it
;
for
freedom
,
as
for
honour
,
life
may
and
*NL*
should
be
ventured
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
captivity
is
the
greatest
evil
*NL*
that
can
fall
to
the
lot
of
man
.
I
say
this
,
Sancho
,
because
thou
hast
*NL*
seen
the
good
cheer
,
the
abundance
we
have
enjoyed
in
this
castle
we
are
*NL*
leaving
;
well
then
,
amid
those
dainty
banquets
and
snow-cooled
beverages
*NL*
I
felt
as
though
I
were
undergoing
the
straits
of
hunger
,
because
I
did
*NL*
not
enjoy
them
with
the
same
freedom
as
if
they
had
been
mine
own
;
for
*NL*
the
sense
of
being
under
an
obligation
to
return
benefits
and
favours
*NL*
received
is
a
restraint
that
checks
the
independence
of
the
spirit
.
Happy
*NL*
he
,
to
whom
heaven
has
given
a
piece
of
bread
for
which
he
is
not
bound
*NL*
to
give
thanks
to
any
but
heaven
itself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
your
worship
says
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
it
is
not
becoming
that
there
*NL*
should
be
no
thanks
on
our
part
for
two
hundred
gold
crowns
that
the
*NL*
duke
's
majordomo
has
given
me
in
a
little
purse
which
I
carry
next
my
*NL*
heart
,
like
a
warming
plaster
or
comforter
,
to
meet
any
chance
calls
;
for
*NL*
we
sha
n't
always
find
castles
where
they
'll
entertain
us
;
now
and
then
we
*NL*
may
light
upon
roadside
inns
where
they
'll
cudgel
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
conversation
of
this
sort
the
knight
and
squire
errant
were
pursuing
*NL*
their
journey
,
when
,
after
they
had
gone
a
little
more
than
half
a
*NL*
league
,
they
perceived
some
dozen
men
dressed
like
labourers
stretched
*NL*
upon
their
cloaks
on
the
grass
of
a
green
meadow
eating
their
dinner
.
*NL*
They
had
beside
them
what
seemed
to
be
white
sheets
concealing
some
*NL*
objects
under
them
,
standing
upright
or
lying
flat
,
and
arranged
at
*NL*
intervals
.
Don
Quixote
approached
the
diners
,
and
,
saluting
them
*NL*
courteously
first
,
he
asked
them
what
it
was
those
cloths
covered
.
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
answered
one
of
the
party
,
``
under
these
cloths
are
some
images
*NL*
carved
in
relief
intended
for
a
retablo
we
are
putting
up
in
our
village
;
*NL*
we
carry
them
covered
up
that
they
may
not
be
soiled
,
and
on
our
*NL*
shoulders
that
they
may
not
be
broken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
your
good
leave
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
should
like
to
see
them
;
for
*NL*
images
that
are
carried
so
carefully
no
doubt
must
be
fine
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
they
were
!
''
said
the
other
;
``
let
the
money
they
cost
*NL*
speak
for
that
;
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
not
one
of
them
that
*NL*
does
not
stand
us
in
more
than
fifty
ducats
;
and
that
your
worship
may
*NL*
judge
;
wait
a
moment
,
and
you
shall
see
with
your
own
eyes
;
''
and
getting
*NL*
up
from
his
dinner
he
went
and
uncovered
the
first
image
,
which
proved
to
*NL*
be
one
of
Saint
George
on
horseback
with
a
serpent
writhing
at
his
feet
*NL*
and
the
lance
thrust
down
its
throat
with
all
that
fierceness
that
is
*NL*
usually
depicted
.
The
whole
group
was
one
blaze
of
gold
,
as
the
saying
*NL*
is
.
On
seeing
it
Don
Quixote
said
,
``
That
knight
was
one
of
the
best
*NL*
knights-errant
the
army
of
heaven
ever
owned
;
he
was
called
Don
Saint
*NL*
George
,
and
he
was
moreover
a
defender
of
maidens
.
Let
us
see
this
next
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
uncovered
it
,
and
it
was
seen
to
be
that
of
Saint
Martin
on
his
*NL*
horse
,
dividing
his
cloak
with
the
beggar
.
The
instant
Don
Quixote
saw
it
*NL*
he
said
,
``
This
knight
too
was
one
of
the
Christian
adventurers
,
but
I
*NL*
believe
he
was
generous
rather
than
valiant
,
as
thou
mayest
perceive
,
*NL*
Sancho
,
by
his
dividing
his
cloak
with
the
beggar
and
giving
him
half
of
*NL*
it
;
no
doubt
it
was
winter
at
the
time
,
for
otherwise
he
would
have
given
*NL*
him
the
whole
of
it
,
so
charitable
was
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
that
,
most
likely
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
that
he
held
with
the
*NL*
proverb
that
says
,
`
For
giving
and
keeping
there
's
need
of
brains
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
laughed
,
and
asked
them
to
take
off
the
next
cloth
,
*NL*
underneath
which
was
seen
the
image
of
the
patron
saint
of
the
Spains
*NL*
seated
on
horseback
,
his
sword
stained
with
blood
,
trampling
on
Moors
and
*NL*
treading
heads
underfoot
;
and
on
seeing
it
Don
Quixote
exclaimed
,
``
Ay
,
*NL*
this
is
a
knight
,
and
of
the
squadrons
of
Christ
!
This
one
is
called
Don
*NL*
Saint
James
the
Moorslayer
,
one
of
the
bravest
saints
and
knights
the
*NL*
world
ever
had
or
heaven
has
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
then
raised
another
cloth
which
it
appeared
covered
Saint
Paul
*NL*
falling
from
his
horse
,
with
all
the
details
that
are
usually
given
in
*NL*
representations
of
his
conversion
.
When
Don
Quixote
saw
it
,
rendered
in
*NL*
such
lifelike
style
that
one
would
have
said
Christ
was
speaking
and
Paul
*NL*
answering
,
``
This
,
''
he
said
,
``
was
in
his
time
the
greatest
enemy
that
the
*NL*
Church
of
God
our
Lord
had
,
and
the
greatest
champion
it
will
ever
have
;
*NL*
a
knight-errant
in
life
,
a
steadfast
saint
in
death
,
an
untiring
labourer
*NL*
in
the
Lord
's
vineyard
,
a
teacher
of
the
Gentiles
,
whose
school
was
*NL*
heaven
,
and
whose
instructor
and
master
was
Jesus
Christ
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
more
images
,
so
Don
Quixote
bade
them
cover
them
up
again
,
*NL*
and
said
to
those
who
had
brought
them
,
``
I
take
it
as
a
happy
omen
,
*NL*
brothers
,
to
have
seen
what
I
have
;
for
these
saints
and
knights
were
of
*NL*
the
same
profession
as
myself
,
which
is
the
calling
of
arms
;
only
there
*NL*
is
this
difference
between
them
and
me
,
that
they
were
saints
,
and
fought
*NL*
with
divine
weapons
,
and
I
am
a
sinner
and
fight
with
human
ones
.
They
*NL*
won
heaven
by
force
of
arms
,
for
heaven
suffereth
violence
;
and
I
,
so
*NL*
far
,
know
not
what
I
have
won
by
dint
of
my
sufferings
;
but
if
my
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
were
to
be
released
from
hers
,
perhaps
with
mended
*NL*
fortunes
and
a
mind
restored
to
itself
I
might
direct
my
steps
in
a
*NL*
better
path
than
I
am
following
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
God
hear
and
sin
be
deaf
,
''
said
Sancho
to
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
were
filled
with
wonder
,
as
well
at
the
figure
as
at
the
words
of
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
though
they
did
not
understand
one
half
of
what
he
meant
by
*NL*
them
.
They
finished
their
dinner
,
took
their
images
on
their
backs
,
and
*NL*
bidding
farewell
to
Don
Quixote
resumed
their
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
amazed
afresh
at
the
extent
of
his
master
's
knowledge
,
as
much
*NL*
as
if
he
had
never
known
him
,
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
no
*NL*
story
or
event
in
the
world
that
he
had
not
at
his
fingers
'
ends
and
*NL*
fixed
in
his
memory
,
and
he
said
to
him
,
``
In
truth
,
master
mine
,
if
this
*NL*
that
has
happened
to
us
to-day
is
to
be
called
an
adventure
,
it
has
been
*NL*
one
of
the
sweetest
and
pleasantest
that
have
befallen
us
in
the
whole
*NL*
course
of
our
travels
;
we
have
come
out
of
it
unbelaboured
and
*NL*
undismayed
,
neither
have
we
drawn
sword
nor
have
we
smitten
the
earth
*NL*
with
our
bodies
,
nor
have
we
been
left
famishing
;
blessed
be
God
that
he
*NL*
has
let
me
see
such
a
thing
with
my
own
eyes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
sayest
well
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
remember
all
times
are
*NL*
not
alike
nor
do
they
always
run
the
same
way
;
and
these
things
the
*NL*
vulgar
commonly
call
omens
,
which
are
not
based
upon
any
natural
reason
,
*NL*
will
by
him
who
is
wise
be
esteemed
and
reckoned
happy
accidents
merely
.
*NL*
One
of
these
believers
in
omens
will
get
up
of
a
morning
,
leave
his
*NL*
house
,
and
meet
a
friar
of
the
order
of
the
blessed
Saint
Francis
,
and
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
met
a
griffin
,
he
will
turn
about
and
go
home
.
With
another
*NL*
Mendoza
the
salt
is
spilt
on
his
table
,
and
gloom
is
spilt
over
his
*NL*
heart
,
as
if
nature
was
obliged
to
give
warning
of
coming
misfortunes
by
*NL*
means
of
such
trivial
things
as
these
.
The
wise
man
and
the
Christian
*NL*
should
not
trifle
with
what
it
may
please
heaven
to
do
.
Scipio
on
coming
*NL*
to
Africa
stumbled
as
he
leaped
on
shore
;
his
soldiers
took
it
as
a
bad
*NL*
omen
;
but
he
,
clasping
the
soil
with
his
arms
,
exclaimed
,
`
Thou
canst
not
*NL*
escape
me
,
Africa
,
for
I
hold
thee
tight
between
my
arms
.
'
Thus
,
Sancho
,
*NL*
meeting
those
images
has
been
to
me
a
most
happy
occurrence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
well
believe
it
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
I
wish
your
worship
would
tell
*NL*
me
what
is
the
reason
that
the
Spaniards
,
when
they
are
about
to
give
*NL*
battle
,
in
calling
on
that
Saint
James
the
Moorslayer
,
say
`
Santiago
and
*NL*
close
Spain
!
'
Is
Spain
,
then
,
open
,
so
that
it
is
needful
to
close
it
;
or
*NL*
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
form
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
very
simple
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
God
,
look
you
,
gave
*NL*
that
great
knight
of
the
Red
Cross
to
Spain
as
her
patron
saint
and
*NL*
protector
,
especially
in
those
hard
struggles
the
Spaniards
had
with
the
*NL*
Moors
;
and
therefore
they
invoke
and
call
upon
him
as
their
defender
in
*NL*
all
their
battles
;
and
in
these
he
has
been
many
a
time
seen
beating
*NL*
down
,
trampling
under
foot
,
destroying
and
slaughtering
the
Hagarene
*NL*
squadrons
in
the
sight
of
all
;
of
which
fact
I
could
give
thee
many
*NL*
examples
recorded
in
truthful
Spanish
histories
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
changed
the
subject
,
and
said
to
his
master
,
``
I
marvel
,
senor
,
at
*NL*
the
boldness
of
Altisidora
,
the
duchess
's
handmaid
;
he
whom
they
call
*NL*
Love
must
have
cruelly
pierced
and
wounded
her
;
they
say
he
is
a
little
*NL*
blind
urchin
who
,
though
blear-eyed
,
or
more
properly
speaking
sightless
,
*NL*
if
he
aims
at
a
heart
,
be
it
ever
so
small
,
hits
it
and
pierces
it
*NL*
through
and
through
with
his
arrows
.
I
have
heard
it
said
too
that
the
*NL*
arrows
of
Love
are
blunted
and
robbed
of
their
points
by
maidenly
modesty
*NL*
and
reserve
;
but
with
this
Altisidora
it
seems
they
are
sharpened
rather
*NL*
than
blunted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bear
in
mind
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
love
is
influenced
by
no
*NL*
consideration
,
recognises
no
restraints
of
reason
,
and
is
of
the
same
*NL*
nature
as
death
,
that
assails
alike
the
lofty
palaces
of
kings
and
the
*NL*
humble
cabins
of
shepherds
;
and
when
it
takes
entire
possession
of
a
*NL*
heart
,
the
first
thing
it
does
is
to
banish
fear
and
shame
from
it
;
and
*NL*
so
without
shame
Altisidora
declared
her
passion
,
which
excited
in
my
*NL*
mind
embarrassment
rather
than
commiseration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Notable
cruelty
!
''
exclaimed
Sancho
;
``
unheard-of
ingratitude
!
I
can
only
*NL*
say
for
myself
that
the
very
smallest
loving
word
of
hers
would
have
*NL*
subdued
me
and
made
a
slave
of
me

The
devil
!
What
a
heart
of
marble
,
*NL*
what
bowels
of
brass
,
what
a
soul
of
mortar
!
But
I
ca
n't
imagine
what
it
*NL*
is
that
this
damsel
saw
in
your
worship
that
could
have
conquered
and
*NL*
captivated
her
so
.
What
gallant
figure
was
it
,
what
bold
bearing
,
what
*NL*
sprightly
grace
,
what
comeliness
of
feature
,
which
of
these
things
by
*NL*
itself
,
or
what
all
together
,
could
have
made
her
fall
in
love
with
you
?
*NL*
For
indeed
and
in
truth
many
a
time
I
stop
to
look
at
your
worship
from
*NL*
the
sole
of
your
foot
to
the
topmost
hair
of
your
head
,
and
I
see
more
to
*NL*
frighten
one
than
to
make
one
fall
in
love
;
moreover
I
have
heard
say
*NL*
that
beauty
is
the
first
and
main
thing
that
excites
love
,
and
as
your
*NL*
worship
has
none
at
all
,
I
do
n't
know
what
the
poor
creature
fell
in
love
*NL*
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Recollect
,
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
there
are
two
sorts
of
beauty
,
*NL*
one
of
the
mind
,
the
other
of
the
body
;
that
of
the
mind
displays
and
*NL*
exhibits
itself
in
intelligence
,
in
modesty
,
in
honourable
conduct
,
in
*NL*
generosity
,
in
good
breeding
;
and
all
these
qualities
are
possible
and
*NL*
may
exist
in
an
ugly
man
;
and
when
it
is
this
sort
of
beauty
and
not
that
*NL*
of
the
body
that
is
the
attraction
,
love
is
apt
to
spring
up
suddenly
and
*NL*
violently
.
I
,
Sancho
,
perceive
clearly
enough
that
I
am
not
beautiful
,
*NL*
but
at
the
same
time
I
know
I
am
not
hideous
;
and
it
is
enough
for
an
*NL*
honest
man
not
to
be
a
monster
to
be
an
object
of
love
,
if
only
he
*NL*
possesses
the
endowments
of
mind
I
have
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
engaged
in
this
discourse
they
were
making
their
way
through
a
wood
*NL*
that
lay
beyond
the
road
,
when
suddenly
,
without
expecting
anything
of
*NL*
the
kind
,
Don
Quixote
found
himself
caught
in
some
nets
of
green
cord
*NL*
stretched
from
one
tree
to
another
;
and
unable
to
conceive
what
it
could
*NL*
be
,
he
said
to
Sancho
,
``
Sancho
,
it
strikes
me
this
affair
of
these
nets
*NL*
will
prove
one
of
the
strangest
adventures
imaginable
.
May
I
die
if
the
*NL*
enchanters
that
persecute
me
are
not
trying
to
entangle
me
in
them
and
*NL*
delay
my
journey
,
by
way
of
revenge
for
my
obduracy
towards
Altisidora
.
*NL*
Well
then
let
me
tell
them
that
if
these
nets
,
instead
of
being
green
*NL*
cord
,
were
made
of
the
hardest
diamonds
,
or
stronger
than
that
wherewith
*NL*
the
jealous
god
of
blacksmiths
enmeshed
Venus
and
Mars
,
I
would
break
*NL*
them
as
easily
as
if
they
were
made
of
rushes
or
cotton
threads
.
''
But
*NL*
just
as
he
was
about
to
press
forward
and
break
through
all
,
suddenly
*NL*
from
among
some
trees
two
shepherdesses
of
surpassing
beauty
presented
*NL*
themselves
to
his
sight
--
or
at
least
damsels
dressed
like
shepherdesses
,
*NL*
save
that
their
jerkins
and
sayas
were
of
fine
brocade
;
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
the
sayas
were
rich
farthingales
of
gold
embroidered
tabby
.
Their
hair
,
*NL*
that
in
its
golden
brightness
vied
with
the
beams
of
the
sun
itself
,
fell
*NL*
loose
upon
their
shoulders
and
was
crowned
with
garlands
twined
with
*NL*
green
laurel
and
red
everlasting
;
and
their
years
to
all
appearance
were
*NL*
not
under
fifteen
nor
above
eighteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
spectacle
that
filled
Sancho
with
amazement
,
fascinated
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
made
the
sun
halt
in
his
course
to
behold
them
,
and
held
all
*NL*
four
in
a
strange
silence
.
One
of
the
shepherdesses
,
at
length
,
was
the
*NL*
first
to
speak
and
said
to
Don
Quixote
,
``
Hold
,
sir
knight
,
and
do
not
*NL*
break
these
nets
;
for
they
are
not
spread
here
to
do
you
any
harm
,
but
*NL*
only
for
our
amusement
;
and
as
I
know
you
will
ask
why
they
have
been
put
*NL*
up
,
and
who
we
are
,
I
will
tell
you
in
a
few
words
.
In
a
village
some
two
*NL*
leagues
from
this
,
where
there
are
many
people
of
quality
and
rich
*NL*
gentlefolk
,
it
was
agreed
upon
by
a
number
of
friends
and
relations
to
*NL*
come
with
their
wives
,
sons
and
daughters
,
neighbours
,
friends
and
*NL*
kinsmen
,
and
make
holiday
in
this
spot
,
which
is
one
of
the
pleasantest
*NL*
in
the
whole
neighbourhood
,
setting
up
a
new
pastoral
Arcadia
among
*NL*
ourselves
,
we
maidens
dressing
ourselves
as
shepherdesses
and
the
youths
*NL*
as
shepherds
.
We
have
prepared
two
eclogues
,
one
by
the
famous
poet
*NL*
Garcilasso
,
the
other
by
the
most
excellent
Camoens
,
in
its
own
*NL*
Portuguese
tongue
,
but
we
have
not
as
yet
acted
them
.
Yesterday
was
the
*NL*
first
day
of
our
coming
here
;
we
have
a
few
of
what
they
say
are
called
*NL*
field-tents
pitched
among
the
trees
on
the
bank
of
an
ample
brook
that
*NL*
fertilises
all
these
meadows
;
last
night
we
spread
these
nets
in
the
*NL*
trees
here
to
snare
the
silly
little
birds
that
startled
by
the
noise
we
*NL*
make
may
fly
into
them
.
If
you
please
to
be
our
guest
,
senor
,
you
will
be
*NL*
welcomed
heartily
and
courteously
,
for
here
just
now
neither
care
nor
*NL*
sorrow
shall
enter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
her
peace
and
said
no
more
,
and
Don
Quixote
made
answer
,
``
Of
a
*NL*
truth
,
fairest
lady
,
Actaeon
when
he
unexpectedly
beheld
Diana
bathing
in
*NL*
the
stream
could
not
have
been
more
fascinated
and
wonderstruck
than
I
at
*NL*
the
sight
of
your
beauty
.
I
commend
your
mode
of
entertainment
,
and
thank
*NL*
you
for
the
kindness
of
your
invitation
;
and
if
I
can
serve
you
,
you
may
*NL*
command
me
with
full
confidence
of
being
obeyed
,
for
my
profession
is
*NL*
none
other
than
to
show
myself
grateful
,
and
ready
to
serve
persons
of
*NL*
all
conditions
,
but
especially
persons
of
quality
such
as
your
appearance
*NL*
indicates
;
and
if
,
instead
of
taking
up
,
as
they
probably
do
,
but
a
small
*NL*
space
,
these
nets
took
up
the
whole
surface
of
the
globe
,
I
would
seek
*NL*
out
new
worlds
through
which
to
pass
,
so
as
not
to
break
them
;
and
that
*NL*
ye
may
give
some
degree
of
credence
to
this
exaggerated
language
of
mine
,
*NL*
know
that
it
is
no
less
than
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
that
makes
this
*NL*
declaration
to
you
,
if
indeed
it
be
that
such
a
name
has
reached
your
*NL*
ears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
friend
of
my
soul
,
''
instantly
exclaimed
the
other
shepherdess
,
``
what
*NL*
great
good
fortune
has
befallen
us
!
Seest
thou
this
gentleman
we
have
*NL*
before
us
?
Well
then
let
me
tell
thee
he
is
the
most
valiant
and
the
most
*NL*
devoted
and
the
most
courteous
gentleman
in
all
the
world
,
unless
a
*NL*
history
of
his
achievements
that
has
been
printed
and
I
have
read
is
*NL*
telling
lies
and
deceiving
us
.
I
will
lay
a
wager
that
this
good
fellow
*NL*
who
is
with
him
is
one
Sancho
Panza
his
squire
,
whose
drolleries
none
can
*NL*
equal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
am
that
same
droll
and
squire
you
speak
*NL*
of
,
and
this
gentleman
is
my
master
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
the
same
*NL*
that
's
in
the
history
and
that
they
talk
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
friend
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
let
us
entreat
him
to
stay
;
for
it
will
*NL*
give
our
fathers
and
brothers
infinite
pleasure
;
I
too
have
heard
just
*NL*
what
thou
hast
told
me
of
the
valour
of
the
one
and
the
drolleries
of
the
*NL*
other
;
and
what
is
more
,
of
him
they
say
that
he
is
the
most
constant
and
*NL*
loyal
lover
that
was
ever
heard
of
,
and
that
his
lady
is
one
Dulcinea
del
*NL*
Toboso
,
to
whom
all
over
Spain
the
palm
of
beauty
is
awarded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
justly
awarded
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
unless
,
indeed
,
your
unequalled
*NL*
beauty
makes
it
a
matter
of
doubt
.
But
spare
yourselves
the
trouble
,
*NL*
ladies
,
of
pressing
me
to
stay
,
for
the
urgent
calls
of
my
profession
do
*NL*
not
allow
me
to
take
rest
under
any
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
there
came
up
to
the
spot
where
the
four
stood
a
brother
*NL*
of
one
of
the
two
shepherdesses
,
like
them
in
shepherd
costume
,
and
as
*NL*
richly
and
gaily
dressed
as
they
were
.
They
told
him
that
their
companion
*NL*
was
the
valiant
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
and
the
other
Sancho
his
*NL*
squire
,
of
whom
he
knew
already
from
having
read
their
history
.
The
gay
*NL*
shepherd
offered
him
his
services
and
begged
that
he
would
accompany
him
*NL*
to
their
tents
,
and
Don
Quixote
had
to
give
way
and
comply
.
And
now
the
*NL*
game
was
started
,
and
the
nets
were
filled
with
a
variety
of
birds
that
*NL*
deceived
by
the
colour
fell
into
the
danger
they
were
flying
from
.
*NL*
Upwards
of
thirty
persons
,
all
gaily
attired
as
shepherds
and
*NL*
shepherdesses
,
assembled
on
the
spot
,
and
were
at
once
informed
who
Don
*NL*
Quixote
and
his
squire
were
,
whereat
they
were
not
a
little
delighted
,
as
*NL*
they
knew
of
him
already
through
his
history
.
They
repaired
to
the
tents
,
*NL*
where
they
found
tables
laid
out
,
and
choicely
,
plentifully
,
and
neatly
*NL*
furnished
.
They
treated
Don
Quixote
as
a
person
of
distinction
,
giving
*NL*
him
the
place
of
honour
,
and
all
observed
him
,
and
were
full
of
*NL*
astonishment
at
the
spectacle
.
At
last
the
cloth
being
removed
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
with
great
composure
lifted
up
his
voice
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
the
greatest
sins
that
men
are
guilty
of
is
--
some
will
say
*NL*
pride
--
but
I
say
ingratitude
,
going
by
the
common
saying
that
hell
is
*NL*
full
of
ingrates
.
This
sin
,
so
far
as
it
has
lain
in
my
power
,
I
have
*NL*
endeavoured
to
avoid
ever
since
I
have
enjoyed
the
faculty
of
reason
;
and
*NL*
if
I
am
unable
to
requite
good
deeds
that
have
been
done
me
by
other
*NL*
deeds
,
I
substitute
the
desire
to
do
so
;
and
if
that
be
not
enough
I
make
*NL*
them
known
publicly
;
for
he
who
declares
and
makes
known
the
good
deeds
*NL*
done
to
him
would
repay
them
by
others
if
it
were
in
his
power
,
and
for
*NL*
the
most
part
those
who
receive
are
the
inferiors
of
those
who
give
.
*NL*
Thus
,
God
is
superior
to
all
because
he
is
the
supreme
giver
,
and
the
*NL*
offerings
of
man
fall
short
by
an
infinite
distance
of
being
a
full
*NL*
return
for
the
gifts
of
God
;
but
gratitude
in
some
degree
makes
up
for
*NL*
this
deficiency
and
shortcoming
.
I
therefore
,
grateful
for
the
favour
*NL*
that
has
been
extended
to
me
here
,
and
unable
to
make
a
return
in
the
*NL*
same
measure
,
restricted
as
I
am
by
the
narrow
limits
of
my
power
,
offer
*NL*
what
I
can
and
what
I
have
to
offer
in
my
own
way
;
and
so
I
declare
that
*NL*
for
two
full
days
I
will
maintain
in
the
middle
of
this
highway
leading
*NL*
to
Saragossa
,
that
these
ladies
disguised
as
shepherdesses
,
who
are
here
*NL*
present
,
are
the
fairest
and
most
courteous
maidens
in
the
world
,
*NL*
excepting
only
the
peerless
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
sole
mistress
of
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
be
it
said
without
offence
to
those
who
hear
me
,
ladies
and
*NL*
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
Sancho
,
who
had
been
listening
with
great
attention
,
*NL*
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
,
``
Is
it
possible
there
is
anyone
in
the
world
*NL*
who
will
dare
to
say
and
swear
that
this
master
of
mine
is
a
madman
?
Say
,
*NL*
gentlemen
shepherds
,
is
there
a
village
priest
,
be
he
ever
so
wise
or
*NL*
learned
,
who
could
say
what
my
master
has
said
;
or
is
there
*NL*
knight-errant
,
whatever
renown
he
may
have
as
a
man
of
valour
,
that
could
*NL*
offer
what
my
master
has
offered
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
turned
upon
Sancho
,
and
with
a
countenance
glowing
with
anger
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
Is
it
possible
,
Sancho
,
there
is
anyone
in
the
whole
world
*NL*
who
will
say
thou
art
not
a
fool
,
with
a
lining
to
match
,
and
I
know
not
*NL*
what
trimmings
of
impertinence
and
roguery
?
Who
asked
thee
to
meddle
in
*NL*
my
affairs
,
or
to
inquire
whether
I
am
a
wise
man
or
a
blockhead
?
Hold
*NL*
thy
peace
;
answer
me
not
a
word
;
saddle
Rocinante
if
he
be
unsaddled
;
and
*NL*
let
us
go
to
put
my
offer
into
execution
;
for
with
the
right
that
I
have
*NL*
on
my
side
thou
mayest
reckon
as
vanquished
all
who
shall
venture
to
*NL*
question
it
;
''
and
in
a
great
rage
,
and
showing
his
anger
plainly
,
he
rose
*NL*
from
his
seat
,
leaving
the
company
lost
in
wonder
,
and
making
them
feel
*NL*
doubtful
whether
they
ought
to
regard
him
as
a
madman
or
a
rational
*NL*
being
.
In
the
end
,
though
they
sought
to
dissuade
him
from
involving
*NL*
himself
in
such
a
challenge
,
assuring
him
they
admitted
his
gratitude
as
*NL*
fully
established
,
and
needed
no
fresh
proofs
to
be
convinced
of
his
*NL*
valiant
spirit
,
as
those
related
in
the
history
of
his
exploits
were
*NL*
sufficient
,
still
Don
Quixote
persisted
in
his
resolve
;
and
mounted
on
*NL*
Rocinante
,
bracing
his
buckler
on
his
arm
and
grasping
his
lance
,
he
*NL*
posted
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
high
road
that
was
not
far
from
the
*NL*
green
meadow
.
Sancho
followed
on
Dapple
,
together
with
all
the
members
of
*NL*
the
pastoral
gathering
,
eager
to
see
what
would
be
the
upshot
of
his
*NL*
vainglorious
and
extraordinary
proposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
then
,
having
,
as
has
been
said
,
planted
himself
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
road
,
made
the
welkin
ring
with
words
to
this
effect
:
``
Ho
*NL*
ye
travellers
and
wayfarers
,
knights
,
squires
,
folk
on
foot
or
on
*NL*
horseback
,
who
pass
this
way
or
shall
pass
in
the
course
of
the
next
two
*NL*
days
!
Know
that
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
knight-errant
,
is
posted
here
*NL*
to
maintain
by
arms
that
the
beauty
and
courtesy
enshrined
in
the
nymphs
*NL*
that
dwell
in
these
meadows
and
groves
surpass
all
upon
earth
,
putting
*NL*
aside
the
lady
of
my
heart
,
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
.
Wherefore
,
let
him
who
*NL*
is
of
the
opposite
opinion
come
on
,
for
here
I
await
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
he
repeated
the
same
words
,
and
twice
they
fell
unheard
by
any
*NL*
adventurer
;
but
fate
,
that
was
guiding
affairs
for
him
from
better
to
*NL*
better
,
so
ordered
it
that
shortly
afterwards
there
appeared
on
the
road
*NL*
a
crowd
of
men
on
horseback
,
many
of
them
with
lances
in
their
hands
,
all
*NL*
riding
in
a
compact
body
and
in
great
haste
.
No
sooner
had
those
who
were
*NL*
with
Don
Quixote
seen
them
than
they
turned
about
and
withdrew
to
some
*NL*
distance
from
the
road
,
for
they
knew
that
if
they
stayed
some
harm
might
*NL*
come
to
them
;
but
Don
Quixote
with
intrepid
heart
stood
his
ground
,
and
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
shielded
himself
with
Rocinante
's
hind-quarters
.
The
troop
*NL*
of
lancers
came
up
,
and
one
of
them
who
was
in
advance
began
shouting
to
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
``
Get
out
of
the
way
,
you
son
of
the
devil
,
or
these
bulls
*NL*
will
knock
you
to
pieces
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rabble
!
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
care
nothing
for
bulls
,
be
they
the
*NL*
fiercest
Jarama
breeds
on
its
banks
.
Confess
at
once
,
scoundrels
,
that
*NL*
what
I
have
declared
is
true
;
else
ye
have
to
deal
with
me
in
combat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
herdsman
had
no
time
to
reply
,
nor
Don
Quixote
to
get
out
of
the
way
*NL*
even
if
he
wished
;
and
so
the
drove
of
fierce
bulls
and
tame
bullocks
,
*NL*
together
with
the
crowd
of
herdsmen
and
others
who
were
taking
them
to
be
*NL*
penned
up
in
a
village
where
they
were
to
be
run
the
next
day
,
passed
*NL*
over
Don
Quixote
and
over
Sancho
,
Rocinante
and
Dapple
,
hurling
them
all
*NL*
to
the
earth
and
rolling
them
over
on
the
ground
.
Sancho
was
left
*NL*
crushed
,
Don
Quixote
scared
,
Dapple
belaboured
and
Rocinante
in
no
very
*NL*
sound
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
got
up
,
however
,
at
length
,
and
Don
Quixote
in
great
haste
,
*NL*
stumbling
here
and
falling
there
,
started
off
running
after
the
drove
,
*NL*
shouting
out
,
``
Hold
!
stay
!
ye
rascally
rabble
,
a
single
knight
awaits
*NL*
you
,
and
he
is
not
of
the
temper
or
opinion
of
those
who
say
,
`
For
a
*NL*
flying
enemy
make
a
bridge
of
silver
.
'
''
The
retreating
party
in
their
*NL*
haste
,
however
,
did
not
stop
for
that
,
or
heed
his
menaces
any
more
than
*NL*
last
year
's
clouds
.
Weariness
brought
Don
Quixote
to
a
halt
,
and
more
*NL*
enraged
than
avenged
he
sat
down
on
the
road
to
wait
until
Sancho
,
*NL*
Rocinante
and
Dapple
came
up
.
When
they
reached
him
master
and
man
*NL*
mounted
once
more
,
and
without
going
back
to
bid
farewell
to
the
mock
or
*NL*
imitation
Arcadia
,
and
more
in
humiliation
than
contentment
,
they
*NL*
continued
their
journey
.

CHAPTER
LIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHEREIN
IS
RELATED
THE
STRANGE
THING
,
WHICH
MAY
BE
REGARDED
AS
AN
*NL*
ADVENTURE
,
THAT
HAPPENED
DON
QUIXOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
clear
limpid
spring
which
they
discovered
in
a
cool
grove
relieved
Don
*NL*
Quixote
and
Sancho
of
the
dust
and
fatigue
due
to
the
unpolite
behaviour
*NL*
of
the
bulls
,
and
by
the
side
of
this
,
having
turned
Dapple
and
Rocinante
*NL*
loose
without
headstall
or
bridle
,
the
forlorn
pair
,
master
and
man
,
*NL*
seated
themselves
.
Sancho
had
recourse
to
the
larder
of
his
alforjas
and
*NL*
took
out
of
them
what
he
called
the
prog
;
Don
Quixote
rinsed
his
mouth
*NL*
and
bathed
his
face
,
by
which
cooling
process
his
flagging
energies
were
*NL*
revived
.
Out
of
pure
vexation
he
remained
without
eating
,
and
out
of
pure
*NL*
politeness
Sancho
did
not
venture
to
touch
a
morsel
of
what
was
before
*NL*
him
,
but
waited
for
his
master
to
act
as
taster
.
Seeing
,
however
,
that
,
*NL*
absorbed
in
thought
,
he
was
forgetting
to
carry
the
bread
to
his
mouth
,
*NL*
he
said
never
a
word
,
and
trampling
every
sort
of
good
breeding
under
*NL*
foot
,
began
to
stow
away
in
his
paunch
the
bread
and
cheese
that
came
to
*NL*
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eat
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
support
life
,
which
is
of
*NL*
more
consequence
to
thee
than
to
me
,
and
leave
me
to
die
under
the
pain
*NL*
of
my
thoughts
and
pressure
of
my
misfortunes
.
I
was
born
,
Sancho
,
to
*NL*
live
dying
,
and
thou
to
die
eating
;
and
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
I
say
,
*NL*
look
at
me
,
printed
in
histories
,
famed
in
arms
,
courteous
in
behaviour
,
*NL*
honoured
by
princes
,
courted
by
maidens
;
and
after
all
,
when
I
looked
*NL*
forward
to
palms
,
triumphs
,
and
crowns
,
won
and
earned
by
my
valiant
*NL*
deeds
,
I
have
this
morning
seen
myself
trampled
on
,
kicked
,
and
crushed
*NL*
by
the
feet
of
unclean
and
filthy
animals
.
This
thought
blunts
my
teeth
,
*NL*
paralyses
my
jaws
,
cramps
my
hands
,
and
robs
me
of
all
appetite
for
food
;
*NL*
so
much
so
that
I
have
a
mind
to
let
myself
die
of
hunger
,
the
cruelest
*NL*
death
of
all
deaths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
munching
hard
all
the
time
,
``
your
worship
does
*NL*
not
agree
with
the
proverb
that
says
,
`
Let
Martha
die
,
but
let
her
die
*NL*
with
a
full
belly
.
'
I
,
at
any
rate
,
have
no
mind
to
kill
myself
;
so
far
*NL*
from
that
,
I
mean
to
do
as
the
cobbler
does
,
who
stretches
the
leather
*NL*
with
his
teeth
until
he
makes
it
reach
as
far
as
he
wants
.
I
'll
stretch
*NL*
out
my
life
by
eating
until
it
reaches
the
end
heaven
has
fixed
for
it
;
*NL*
and
let
me
tell
you
,
senor
,
there
's
no
greater
folly
than
to
think
of
*NL*
dying
of
despair
as
your
worship
does
;
take
my
advice
,
and
after
eating
*NL*
lie
down
and
sleep
a
bit
on
this
green
grass-mattress
,
and
you
will
see
*NL*
that
when
you
awake
you
'll
feel
something
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
did
as
he
recommended
,
for
it
struck
him
that
Sancho
's
*NL*
reasoning
was
more
like
a
philosopher
's
than
a
blockhead
's
,
and
said
he
,
*NL*
``
Sancho
,
if
thou
wilt
do
for
me
what
I
am
going
to
tell
thee
my
ease
of
*NL*
mind
would
be
more
assured
and
my
heaviness
of
heart
not
so
great
;
and
it
*NL*
is
this
;
to
go
aside
a
little
while
I
am
sleeping
in
accordance
with
thy
*NL*
advice
,
and
,
making
bare
thy
carcase
to
the
air
,
to
give
thyself
three
or
*NL*
four
hundred
lashes
with
Rocinante
's
reins
,
on
account
of
the
three
*NL*
thousand
and
odd
thou
art
to
give
thyself
for
the
disenchantment
of
*NL*
Dulcinea
;
for
it
is
a
great
pity
that
the
poor
lady
should
be
left
*NL*
enchanted
through
thy
carelessness
and
negligence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
that
point
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
let
us
*NL*
both
go
to
sleep
now
,
and
after
that
,
God
has
decreed
what
will
happen
.
*NL*
Let
me
tell
your
worship
that
for
a
man
to
whip
himself
in
cold
blood
is
*NL*
a
hard
thing
,
especially
if
the
stripes
fall
upon
an
ill-nourished
and
*NL*
worse-fed
body
.
Let
my
lady
Dulcinea
have
patience
,
and
when
she
is
least
*NL*
expecting
it
,
she
will
see
me
made
a
riddle
of
with
whipping
,
and
`
until
*NL*
death
it
's
all
life
;
'
I
mean
that
I
have
still
life
in
me
,
and
the
desire
*NL*
to
make
good
what
I
have
promised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
thanked
him
,
and
ate
a
little
,
and
Sancho
a
good
deal
,
and
*NL*
then
they
both
lay
down
to
sleep
,
leaving
those
two
inseparable
friends
*NL*
and
comrades
,
Rocinante
and
Dapple
,
to
their
own
devices
and
to
feed
*NL*
unrestrained
upon
the
abundant
grass
with
which
the
meadow
was
furnished
.
*NL*
They
woke
up
rather
late
,
mounted
once
more
and
resumed
their
journey
,
*NL*
pushing
on
to
reach
an
inn
which
was
in
sight
,
apparently
a
league
off
.
I
*NL*
say
an
inn
,
because
Don
Quixote
called
it
so
,
contrary
to
his
usual
*NL*
practice
of
calling
all
inns
castles
.
They
reached
it
,
and
asked
the
*NL*
landlord
if
they
could
put
up
there
.
He
said
yes
,
with
as
much
comfort
*NL*
and
as
good
fare
as
they
could
find
in
Saragossa
.
They
dismounted
,
and
*NL*
Sancho
stowed
away
his
larder
in
a
room
of
which
the
landlord
gave
him
*NL*
the
key
.
He
took
the
beasts
to
the
stable
,
fed
them
,
and
came
back
to
see
*NL*
what
orders
Don
Quixote
,
who
was
seated
on
a
bench
at
the
door
,
had
for
*NL*
him
,
giving
special
thanks
to
heaven
that
this
inn
had
not
been
taken
for
*NL*
a
castle
by
his
master
.
Supper-time
came
,
and
they
repaired
to
their
*NL*
room
,
and
Sancho
asked
the
landlord
what
he
had
to
give
them
for
supper
.
*NL*
To
this
the
landlord
replied
that
his
mouth
should
be
the
measure
;
he
had
*NL*
only
to
ask
what
he
would
;
for
that
inn
was
provided
with
the
birds
of
*NL*
the
air
and
the
fowls
of
the
earth
and
the
fish
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
need
of
all
that
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
if
they
'll
roast
us
a
couple
*NL*
of
chickens
we
'll
be
satisfied
,
for
my
master
is
delicate
and
eats
*NL*
little
,
and
I
'm
not
over
and
above
gluttonous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
replied
he
had
no
chickens
,
for
the
kites
had
stolen
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
let
senor
landlord
tell
them
to
roast
a
*NL*
pullet
,
so
that
it
is
a
tender
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pullet
!
My
father
!
''
said
the
landlord
;
``
indeed
and
in
truth
it
's
only
*NL*
yesterday
I
sent
over
fifty
to
the
city
to
sell
;
but
saving
pullets
ask
*NL*
what
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
you
will
not
be
without
veal
or
kid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
``
there
's
none
in
the
house
,
for
it
's
all
*NL*
finished
;
but
next
week
there
will
be
enough
and
to
spare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
good
that
does
us
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
'll
lay
a
bet
that
all
these
*NL*
short-comings
are
going
to
wind
up
in
plenty
of
bacon
and
eggs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
``
my
guest
's
wits
must
be
precious
dull
;
I
*NL*
tell
him
I
have
neither
pullets
nor
hens
,
and
he
wants
me
to
have
eggs
!
*NL*
Talk
of
other
dainties
,
if
you
please
,
and
do
n't
ask
for
hens
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Body
o
'
me
!
''
said
Sancho
,
``
let
's
settle
the
matter
;
say
at
once
what
you
*NL*
have
got
,
and
let
us
have
no
more
words
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
and
earnest
,
senor
guest
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
``
all
I
have
is
a
*NL*
couple
of
cow-heels
like
calves
'
feet
,
or
a
couple
of
calves
'
feet
like
*NL*
cowheels
;
they
are
boiled
with
chick-peas
,
onions
,
and
bacon
,
and
at
this
*NL*
moment
they
are
crying
`
Come
eat
me
,
come
eat
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mark
them
for
mine
on
the
spot
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
let
nobody
touch
them
;
*NL*
I
'll
pay
better
for
them
than
anyone
else
,
for
I
could
not
wish
for
*NL*
anything
more
to
my
taste
;
and
I
do
n't
care
a
pin
whether
they
are
feet
*NL*
or
heels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
shall
touch
them
,
''
said
the
landlord
;
``
for
the
other
guests
I
*NL*
have
,
being
persons
of
high
quality
,
bring
their
own
cook
and
caterer
and
*NL*
larder
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
come
to
people
of
quality
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
there
's
nobody
more
so
*NL*
than
my
master
;
but
the
calling
he
follows
does
not
allow
of
larders
or
*NL*
store-rooms
;
we
lay
ourselves
down
in
the
middle
of
a
meadow
,
and
fill
*NL*
ourselves
with
acorns
or
medlars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
ended
Sancho
's
conversation
with
the
landlord
,
Sancho
not
caring
to
*NL*
carry
it
any
farther
by
answering
him
;
for
he
had
already
asked
him
what
*NL*
calling
or
what
profession
it
was
his
master
was
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Supper-time
having
come
,
then
,
Don
Quixote
betook
himself
to
his
room
,
*NL*
the
landlord
brought
in
the
stew-pan
just
as
it
was
,
and
he
sat
himself
*NL*
down
to
sup
very
resolutely
.
It
seems
that
in
another
room
,
which
was
*NL*
next
to
Don
Quixote
's
,
with
nothing
but
a
thin
partition
to
separate
it
,
*NL*
he
overheard
these
words
,
``
As
you
live
,
Senor
Don
Jeronimo
,
while
they
*NL*
are
bringing
supper
,
let
us
read
another
chapter
of
the
Second
Part
of
*NL*
`
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
Don
Quixote
heard
his
own
name
,
he
started
to
his
feet
and
*NL*
listened
with
open
ears
to
catch
what
they
said
about
him
,
and
heard
the
*NL*
Don
Jeronimo
who
had
been
addressed
say
in
reply
,
``
Why
would
you
have
us
*NL*
read
that
absurd
stuff
,
Don
Juan
,
when
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
who
*NL*
has
read
the
First
Part
of
the
history
of
`
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
'
to
*NL*
take
any
pleasure
in
reading
this
Second
Part
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
that
,
''
said
he
who
was
addressed
as
Don
Juan
,
``
we
shall
do
well
*NL*
to
read
it
,
for
there
is
no
book
so
bad
but
it
has
something
good
in
it
.
*NL*
What
displeases
me
most
in
it
is
that
it
represents
Don
Quixote
as
now
*NL*
cured
of
his
love
for
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
Don
Quixote
,
full
of
wrath
and
indignation
,
lifted
up
his
*NL*
voice
and
said
,
``
Whoever
he
may
be
who
says
that
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
*NL*
has
forgotten
or
can
forget
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
I
will
teach
him
with
*NL*
equal
arms
that
what
he
says
is
very
far
from
the
truth
;
for
neither
can
*NL*
the
peerless
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
be
forgotten
,
nor
can
forgetfulness
have
*NL*
a
place
in
Don
Quixote
;
his
motto
is
constancy
,
and
his
profession
to
*NL*
maintain
the
same
with
his
life
and
never
wrong
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
this
that
answers
us
?
''
said
they
in
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
should
it
be
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
himself
,
*NL*
who
will
make
good
all
he
has
said
and
all
he
will
say
;
for
pledges
do
n't
*NL*
trouble
a
good
payer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
had
hardly
uttered
these
words
when
two
gentlemen
,
for
such
they
*NL*
seemed
to
be
,
entered
the
room
,
and
one
of
them
,
throwing
his
arms
round
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
neck
,
said
to
him
,
``
Your
appearance
can
not
leave
any
*NL*
question
as
to
your
name
,
nor
can
your
name
fail
to
identify
your
*NL*
appearance
;
unquestionably
,
senor
,
you
are
the
real
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
cynosure
and
morning
star
of
knight-errantry
,
despite
and
in
*NL*
defiance
of
him
who
has
sought
to
usurp
your
name
and
bring
to
naught
*NL*
your
achievements
,
as
the
author
of
this
book
which
I
here
present
to
you
*NL*
has
done
;
''
and
with
this
he
put
a
book
which
his
companion
carried
into
*NL*
the
hands
of
Don
Quixote
,
who
took
it
,
and
without
replying
began
to
run
*NL*
his
eye
over
it
;
but
he
presently
returned
it
saying
,
``
In
the
little
I
*NL*
have
seen
I
have
discovered
three
things
in
this
author
that
deserve
to
*NL*
be
censured
.
The
first
is
some
words
that
I
have
read
in
the
preface
;
the
*NL*
next
that
the
language
is
Aragonese
,
for
sometimes
he
writes
without
*NL*
articles
;
and
the
third
,
which
above
all
stamps
him
as
ignorant
,
is
that
*NL*
he
goes
wrong
and
departs
from
the
truth
in
the
most
important
part
of
*NL*
the
history
,
for
here
he
says
that
my
squire
Sancho
Panza
's
wife
is
*NL*
called
Mari
Gutierrez
,
when
she
is
called
nothing
of
the
sort
,
but
Teresa
*NL*
Panza
;
and
when
a
man
errs
on
such
an
important
point
as
this
there
is
*NL*
good
reason
to
fear
that
he
is
in
error
on
every
other
point
in
the
*NL*
history
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
sort
of
historian
,
indeed
!
''
exclaimed
Sancho
at
this
;
``
he
must
*NL*
know
a
deal
about
our
affairs
when
he
calls
my
wife
Teresa
Panza
,
Mari
*NL*
Gutierrez
;
take
the
book
again
,
senor
,
and
see
if
I
am
in
it
and
if
he
*NL*
has
changed
my
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
your
talk
,
friend
,
''
said
Don
Jeronimo
,
``
no
doubt
you
are
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
's
squire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
I
'm
proud
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
,
then
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
``
this
new
author
does
not
handle
you
*NL*
with
the
decency
that
displays
itself
in
your
person
;
he
makes
you
out
a
*NL*
heavy
feeder
and
a
fool
,
and
not
in
the
least
droll
,
and
a
very
different
*NL*
being
from
the
Sancho
described
in
the
First
Part
of
your
master
's
*NL*
history
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forgive
him
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
he
might
have
left
me
in
my
corner
*NL*
without
troubling
his
head
about
me
;
`
let
him
who
knows
how
ring
the
*NL*
bells
;
`
Saint
Peter
is
very
well
in
Rome
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
gentlemen
pressed
Don
Quixote
to
come
into
their
room
and
have
*NL*
supper
with
them
,
as
they
knew
very
well
there
was
nothing
in
that
inn
*NL*
fit
for
one
of
his
sort
.
Don
Quixote
,
who
was
always
polite
,
yielded
to
*NL*
their
request
and
supped
with
them
.
Sancho
stayed
behind
with
the
stew
.
*NL*
and
invested
with
plenary
delegated
authority
seated
himself
at
the
head
*NL*
of
the
table
,
and
the
landlord
sat
down
with
him
,
for
he
was
no
less
fond
*NL*
of
cow-heel
and
calves
'
feet
than
Sancho
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
at
supper
Don
Juan
asked
Don
Quixote
what
news
he
had
of
the
lady
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
was
she
married
,
had
she
been
brought
to
bed
,
or
was
*NL*
she
with
child
,
or
did
she
in
maidenhood
,
still
preserving
her
modesty
*NL*
and
delicacy
,
cherish
the
remembrance
of
the
tender
passion
of
Senor
Don
*NL*
Quixote
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
he
replied
,
``
Dulcinea
is
a
maiden
still
,
and
my
passion
more
*NL*
firmly
rooted
than
ever
,
our
intercourse
unsatisfactory
as
before
,
and
*NL*
her
beauty
transformed
into
that
of
a
foul
country
wench
;
''
and
then
he
*NL*
proceeded
to
give
them
a
full
and
particular
account
of
the
enchantment
*NL*
of
Dulcinea
,
and
of
what
had
happened
him
in
the
cave
of
Montesinos
,
*NL*
together
with
what
the
sage
Merlin
had
prescribed
for
her
disenchantment
,
*NL*
namely
the
scourging
of
Sancho
.
*NL*
*NL*
Exceedingly
great
was
the
amusement
the
two
gentlemen
derived
from
*NL*
hearing
Don
Quixote
recount
the
strange
incidents
of
his
history
;
and
if
*NL*
they
were
amazed
by
his
absurdities
they
were
equally
amazed
by
the
*NL*
elegant
style
in
which
he
delivered
them
.
On
the
one
hand
they
regarded
*NL*
him
as
a
man
of
wit
and
sense
,
and
on
the
other
he
seemed
to
them
a
*NL*
maundering
blockhead
,
and
they
could
not
make
up
their
minds
whereabouts
*NL*
between
wisdom
and
folly
they
ought
to
place
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
having
finished
his
supper
,
and
left
the
landlord
in
the
X
*NL*
condition
,
repaired
to
the
room
where
his
master
was
,
and
as
he
came
in
*NL*
said
,
``
May
I
die
,
sirs
,
if
the
author
of
this
book
your
worships
have
got
*NL*
has
any
mind
that
we
should
agree
;
as
he
calls
me
glutton
-LRB-
according
to
*NL*
what
your
worships
say
-RRB-
I
wish
he
may
not
call
me
drunkard
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
does
,
''
said
Don
Jeronimo
;
``
I
can
not
remember
,
however
,
in
what
*NL*
way
,
though
I
know
his
words
are
offensive
,
and
what
is
more
,
lying
,
as
I
*NL*
can
see
plainly
by
the
physiognomy
of
the
worthy
Sancho
before
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
the
Sancho
and
the
Don
Quixote
of
this
*NL*
history
must
be
different
persons
from
those
that
appear
in
the
one
Cide
*NL*
Hamete
Benengeli
wrote
,
who
are
ourselves
;
my
master
valiant
,
wise
,
and
*NL*
true
in
love
,
and
I
simple
,
droll
,
and
neither
glutton
nor
drunkard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
,
''
said
Don
Juan
;
``
and
were
it
possible
,
an
order
should
be
*NL*
issued
that
no
one
should
have
the
presumption
to
deal
with
anything
*NL*
relating
to
Don
Quixote
,
save
his
original
author
Cide
Hamete
;
just
as
*NL*
Alexander
commanded
that
no
one
should
presume
to
paint
his
portrait
save
*NL*
Apelles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
who
will
paint
me
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
let
him
not
abuse
me
;
*NL*
for
patience
will
often
break
down
when
they
heap
insults
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
can
be
offered
to
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
''
said
Don
Juan
,
``
that
he
*NL*
himself
will
not
be
able
to
avenge
,
if
he
does
not
ward
it
off
with
the
*NL*
shield
of
his
patience
,
which
,
I
take
it
,
is
great
and
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
considerable
portion
of
the
night
passed
in
conversation
of
this
sort
,
*NL*
and
though
Don
Juan
wished
Don
Quixote
to
read
more
of
the
book
to
see
*NL*
what
it
was
all
about
,
he
was
not
to
be
prevailed
upon
,
saying
that
he
*NL*
treated
it
as
read
and
pronounced
it
utterly
silly
;
and
,
if
by
any
chance
*NL*
it
should
come
to
its
author
's
ears
that
he
had
it
in
his
hand
,
he
did
*NL*
not
want
him
to
flatter
himself
with
the
idea
that
he
had
read
it
;
for
*NL*
our
thoughts
,
and
still
more
our
eyes
,
should
keep
themselves
aloof
from
*NL*
what
is
obscene
and
filthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
asked
him
whither
he
meant
to
direct
his
steps
.
He
replied
,
to
*NL*
Saragossa
,
to
take
part
in
the
harness
jousts
which
were
held
in
that
*NL*
city
every
year
.
Don
Juan
told
him
that
the
new
history
described
how
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
let
him
be
who
he
might
,
took
part
there
in
a
tilting
at
the
*NL*
ring
,
utterly
devoid
of
invention
,
poor
in
mottoes
,
very
poor
in
costume
,
*NL*
though
rich
in
sillinesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
that
very
reason
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
will
not
set
foot
in
*NL*
Saragossa
;
and
by
that
means
I
shall
expose
to
the
world
the
lie
of
this
*NL*
new
history
writer
,
and
people
will
see
that
I
am
not
the
Don
Quixote
he
*NL*
speaks
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
do
quite
right
,
''
said
Don
Jeronimo
;
``
and
there
are
other
jousts
*NL*
at
Barcelona
in
which
Senor
Don
Quixote
may
display
his
prowess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
mean
to
do
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
as
it
is
now
time
,
I
*NL*
pray
your
worships
to
give
me
leave
to
retire
to
bed
,
and
to
place
and
*NL*
retain
me
among
the
number
of
your
greatest
friends
and
servants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
me
too
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
maybe
I
'll
be
good
for
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
they
exchanged
farewells
,
and
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
retired
to
*NL*
their
room
,
leaving
Don
Juan
and
Don
Jeronimo
amazed
to
see
the
medley
he
*NL*
made
of
his
good
sense
and
his
craziness
;
and
they
felt
thoroughly
*NL*
convinced
that
these
,
and
not
those
their
Aragonese
author
described
,
*NL*
were
the
genuine
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
.
Don
Quixote
rose
betimes
,
and
*NL*
bade
adieu
to
his
hosts
by
knocking
at
the
partition
of
the
other
room
.
*NL*
Sancho
paid
the
landlord
magnificently
,
and
recommended
him
either
to
say
*NL*
less
about
the
providing
of
his
inn
or
to
keep
it
better
provided

CHAPTER
LX
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
DON
QUIXOTE
ON
HIS
WAY
TO
BARCELONA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fresh
morning
giving
promise
of
a
cool
day
as
Don
Quixote
*NL*
quitted
the
inn
,
first
of
all
taking
care
to
ascertain
the
most
direct
*NL*
road
to
Barcelona
without
touching
upon
Saragossa
;
so
anxious
was
he
to
*NL*
make
out
this
new
historian
,
who
they
said
abused
him
so
,
to
be
a
liar
.
*NL*
Well
,
as
it
fell
out
,
nothing
worthy
of
being
recorded
happened
him
for
*NL*
six
days
,
at
the
end
of
which
,
having
turned
aside
out
of
the
road
,
he
*NL*
was
overtaken
by
night
in
a
thicket
of
oak
or
cork
trees
;
for
on
this
*NL*
point
Cide
Hamete
is
not
as
precise
as
he
usually
is
on
other
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
and
man
dismounted
from
their
beasts
,
and
as
soon
as
they
had
*NL*
settled
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
trees
,
Sancho
,
who
had
had
a
good
*NL*
noontide
meal
that
day
,
let
himself
,
without
more
ado
,
pass
the
gates
of
*NL*
sleep
.
But
Don
Quixote
,
whom
his
thoughts
,
far
more
than
hunger
,
kept
*NL*
awake
,
could
not
close
an
eye
,
and
roamed
in
fancy
to
and
fro
through
all
*NL*
sorts
of
places
.
At
one
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
the
cave
*NL*
of
Montesinos
and
saw
Dulcinea
,
transformed
into
a
country
wench
,
*NL*
skipping
and
mounting
upon
her
she-ass
;
again
that
the
words
of
the
sage
*NL*
Merlin
were
sounding
in
his
ears
,
setting
forth
the
conditions
to
be
*NL*
observed
and
the
exertions
to
be
made
for
the
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
.
*NL*
He
lost
all
patience
when
he
considered
the
laziness
and
want
of
charity
*NL*
of
his
squire
Sancho
;
for
to
the
best
of
his
belief
he
had
only
given
*NL*
himself
five
lashes
,
a
number
paltry
and
disproportioned
to
the
vast
*NL*
number
required
.
At
this
thought
he
felt
such
vexation
and
anger
that
he
*NL*
reasoned
the
matter
thus
:
``
If
Alexander
the
Great
cut
the
Gordian
knot
,
*NL*
saying
,
`
To
cut
comes
to
the
same
thing
as
to
untie
,
'
and
yet
did
not
*NL*
fail
to
become
lord
paramount
of
all
Asia
,
neither
more
nor
less
could
*NL*
happen
now
in
Dulcinea
's
disenchantment
if
I
scourge
Sancho
against
his
*NL*
will
;
for
,
if
it
is
the
condition
of
the
remedy
that
Sancho
shall
receive
*NL*
three
thousand
and
odd
lashes
,
what
does
it
matter
to
me
whether
he
*NL*
inflicts
them
himself
,
or
some
one
else
inflicts
them
,
when
the
essential
*NL*
point
is
that
he
receives
them
,
let
them
come
from
whatever
quarter
they
*NL*
may
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
idea
he
went
over
to
Sancho
,
having
first
taken
Rocinante
's
*NL*
reins
and
arranged
them
so
as
to
be
able
to
flog
him
with
them
,
and
began
*NL*
to
untie
the
points
-LRB-
the
common
belief
is
he
had
but
one
in
front
-RRB-
by
*NL*
which
his
breeches
were
held
up
;
but
the
instant
he
approached
him
Sancho
*NL*
woke
up
in
his
full
senses
and
cried
out
,
``
What
is
this
?
Who
is
touching
*NL*
me
and
untrussing
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
I
come
to
make
good
thy
shortcomings
*NL*
and
relieve
my
own
distresses
;
I
come
to
whip
thee
,
Sancho
,
and
wipe
off
*NL*
some
portion
of
the
debt
thou
hast
undertaken
.
Dulcinea
is
perishing
,
*NL*
thou
art
living
on
regardless
,
I
am
dying
of
hope
deferred
;
therefore
*NL*
untruss
thyself
with
a
good
will
,
for
mine
it
is
,
here
,
in
this
retired
*NL*
spot
,
to
give
thee
at
least
two
thousand
lashes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
let
your
worship
keep
quiet
,
or
else
by
*NL*
the
living
God
the
deaf
shall
hear
us
;
the
lashes
I
pledged
myself
to
*NL*
must
be
voluntary
and
not
forced
upon
me
,
and
just
now
I
have
no
fancy
to
*NL*
whip
myself
;
it
is
enough
if
I
give
you
my
word
to
flog
and
flap
myself
*NL*
when
I
have
a
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
not
do
to
leave
it
to
thy
courtesy
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
``
for
thou
art
hard
of
heart
and
,
though
a
clown
,
tender
of
flesh
;
''
and
at
*NL*
the
same
time
he
strove
and
struggled
to
untie
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
this
Sancho
got
up
,
and
grappling
with
his
master
he
gripped
him
*NL*
with
all
his
might
in
his
arms
,
giving
him
a
trip
with
the
heel
stretched
*NL*
him
on
the
ground
on
his
back
,
and
pressing
his
right
knee
on
his
chest
*NL*
held
his
hands
in
his
own
so
that
he
could
neither
move
nor
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
now
,
traitor
!
''
exclaimed
Don
Quixote
.
``
Dost
thou
revolt
against
thy
*NL*
master
and
natural
lord
?
Dost
thou
rise
against
him
who
gives
thee
his
*NL*
bread
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
neither
put
down
king
,
nor
set
up
king
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
only
stand
up
*NL*
for
myself
who
am
my
own
lord
;
if
your
worship
promises
me
to
be
quiet
,
*NL*
and
not
to
offer
to
whip
me
now
,
I
'll
let
you
go
free
and
unhindered
;
if
*NL*
not
--
*NL*
*NL*
Traitor
and
Dona
Sancha
's
foe
,
*NL*
Thou
diest
on
the
spot
.
''
*NL*
Don
Quixote
gave
his
promise
,
and
swore
by
the
life
of
his
thoughts
not
*NL*
to
touch
so
much
as
a
hair
of
his
garments
,
and
to
leave
him
entirely
*NL*
free
and
to
his
own
discretion
to
whip
himself
whenever
he
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
rose
and
removed
some
distance
from
the
spot
,
but
as
he
was
about
*NL*
to
place
himself
leaning
against
another
tree
he
felt
something
touch
his
*NL*
head
,
and
putting
up
his
hands
encountered
somebody
's
two
feet
with
shoes
*NL*
and
stockings
on
them
.
He
trembled
with
fear
and
made
for
another
tree
,
*NL*
where
the
very
same
thing
happened
to
him
,
and
he
fell
a-shouting
,
*NL*
calling
upon
Don
Quixote
to
come
and
protect
him
.
Don
Quixote
did
so
,
and
*NL*
asked
him
what
had
happened
to
him
,
and
what
he
was
afraid
of
.
Sancho
*NL*
replied
that
all
the
trees
were
full
of
men
's
feet
and
legs
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
felt
them
,
and
guessed
at
once
what
it
was
,
and
said
to
Sancho
,
``
Thou
*NL*
hast
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
,
for
these
feet
and
legs
that
thou
feelest
*NL*
but
canst
not
see
belong
no
doubt
to
some
outlaws
and
freebooters
that
*NL*
have
been
hanged
on
these
trees
;
for
the
authorities
in
these
parts
are
*NL*
wont
to
hang
them
up
by
twenties
and
thirties
when
they
catch
them
;
*NL*
whereby
I
conjecture
that
I
must
be
near
Barcelona
;
''
and
it
was
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
as
he
supposed
;
with
the
first
light
they
looked
up
and
saw
that
the
*NL*
fruit
hanging
on
those
trees
were
freebooters
'
bodies
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
day
dawned
;
and
if
the
dead
freebooters
had
scared
them
,
their
*NL*
hearts
were
no
less
troubled
by
upwards
of
forty
living
ones
,
who
all
of
*NL*
a
sudden
surrounded
them
,
and
in
the
Catalan
tongue
bade
them
stand
and
*NL*
wait
until
their
captain
came
up
.
Don
Quixote
was
on
foot
with
his
horse
*NL*
unbridled
and
his
lance
leaning
against
a
tree
,
and
in
short
completely
*NL*
defenceless
;
he
thought
it
best
therefore
to
fold
his
arms
and
bow
his
*NL*
head
and
reserve
himself
for
a
more
favourable
occasion
and
opportunity
.
*NL*
The
robbers
made
haste
to
search
Dapple
,
and
did
not
leave
him
a
single
*NL*
thing
of
all
he
carried
in
the
alforjas
and
in
the
valise
;
and
lucky
it
*NL*
was
for
Sancho
that
the
duke
's
crowns
and
those
he
brought
from
home
were
*NL*
in
a
girdle
that
he
wore
round
him
;
but
for
all
that
these
good
folk
*NL*
would
have
stripped
him
,
and
even
looked
to
see
what
he
had
hidden
*NL*
between
the
skin
and
flesh
,
but
for
the
arrival
at
that
moment
of
their
*NL*
captain
,
who
was
about
thirty-four
years
of
age
apparently
,
strongly
*NL*
built
,
above
the
middle
height
,
of
stern
aspect
and
swarthy
complexion
.
*NL*
He
was
mounted
upon
a
powerful
horse
,
and
had
on
a
coat
of
mail
,
with
*NL*
four
of
the
pistols
they
call
petronels
in
that
country
at
his
waist
.
He
*NL*
saw
that
his
squires
-LRB-
for
so
they
call
those
who
follow
that
trade
-RRB-
were
*NL*
about
to
rifle
Sancho
Panza
,
but
he
ordered
them
to
desist
and
was
at
*NL*
once
obeyed
,
so
the
girdle
escaped
.
He
wondered
to
see
the
lance
leaning
*NL*
against
the
tree
,
the
shield
on
the
ground
,
and
Don
Quixote
in
armour
and
*NL*
dejected
,
with
the
saddest
and
most
melancholy
face
that
sadness
itself
*NL*
could
produce
;
and
going
up
to
him
he
said
,
``
Be
not
so
cast
down
,
good
*NL*
man
,
for
you
have
not
fallen
into
the
hands
of
any
inhuman
Busiris
,
but
*NL*
into
Roque
Guinart
's
,
which
are
more
merciful
than
cruel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cause
of
my
dejection
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
is
not
that
I
have
*NL*
fallen
into
thy
hands
,
O
valiant
Roque
,
whose
fame
is
bounded
by
no
*NL*
limits
on
earth
,
but
that
my
carelessness
should
have
been
so
great
that
*NL*
thy
soldiers
should
have
caught
me
unbridled
,
when
it
is
my
duty
,
*NL*
according
to
the
rule
of
knight-errantry
which
I
profess
,
to
be
always
on
*NL*
the
alert
and
at
all
times
my
own
sentinel
;
for
let
me
tell
thee
,
great
*NL*
Roque
,
had
they
found
me
on
my
horse
,
with
my
lance
and
shield
,
it
would
*NL*
not
have
been
very
easy
for
them
to
reduce
me
to
submission
,
for
I
am
Don
*NL*
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
he
who
hath
filled
the
whole
world
with
his
*NL*
achievements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Roque
Guinart
at
once
perceived
that
Don
Quixote
's
weakness
was
more
akin
*NL*
to
madness
than
to
swagger
;
and
though
he
had
sometimes
heard
him
spoken
*NL*
of
,
he
never
regarded
the
things
attributed
to
him
as
true
,
nor
could
he
*NL*
persuade
himself
that
such
a
humour
could
become
dominant
in
the
heart
of
*NL*
man
;
he
was
extremely
glad
,
therefore
,
to
meet
him
and
test
at
close
*NL*
quarters
what
he
had
heard
of
him
at
a
distance
;
so
he
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Despair
not
,
valiant
knight
,
nor
regard
as
an
untoward
fate
the
position
*NL*
in
which
thou
findest
thyself
;
it
may
be
that
by
these
slips
thy
crooked
*NL*
fortune
will
make
itself
straight
;
for
heaven
by
strange
circuitous
ways
,
*NL*
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
to
man
,
raises
up
the
fallen
and
makes
*NL*
rich
the
poor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
about
to
thank
him
,
when
they
heard
behind
them
a
noise
*NL*
as
of
a
troop
of
horses
;
there
was
,
however
,
but
one
,
riding
on
which
at
*NL*
a
furious
pace
came
a
youth
,
apparently
about
twenty
years
of
age
,
clad
*NL*
in
green
damask
edged
with
gold
and
breeches
and
a
loose
frock
,
with
a
*NL*
hat
looped
up
in
the
Walloon
fashion
,
tight-fitting
polished
boots
,
gilt
*NL*
spurs
,
dagger
and
sword
,
and
in
his
hand
a
musketoon
,
and
a
pair
of
*NL*
pistols
at
his
waist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Roque
turned
round
at
the
noise
and
perceived
this
comely
figure
,
which
*NL*
drawing
near
thus
addressed
him
,
``
I
came
in
quest
of
thee
,
valiant
Roque
,
*NL*
to
find
in
thee
if
not
a
remedy
at
least
relief
in
my
misfortune
;
and
not
*NL*
to
keep
thee
in
suspense
,
for
I
see
thou
dost
not
recognise
me
,
I
will
*NL*
tell
thee
who
I
am
;
I
am
Claudia
Jeronima
,
the
daughter
of
Simon
Forte
,
*NL*
thy
good
friend
,
and
special
enemy
of
Clauquel
Torrellas
,
who
is
thine
*NL*
also
as
being
of
the
faction
opposed
to
thee
.
Thou
knowest
that
this
*NL*
Torrellas
has
a
son
who
is
called
,
or
at
least
was
not
two
hours
since
,
*NL*
Don
Vicente
Torrellas
.
Well
,
to
cut
short
the
tale
of
my
misfortune
,
I
*NL*
will
tell
thee
in
a
few
words
what
this
youth
has
brought
upon
me
.
He
saw
*NL*
me
,
he
paid
court
to
me
,
I
listened
to
him
,
and
,
unknown
to
my
father
,
I
*NL*
loved
him
;
for
there
is
no
woman
,
however
secluded
she
may
live
or
close
*NL*
she
may
be
kept
,
who
will
not
have
opportunities
and
to
spare
for
*NL*
following
her
headlong
impulses
.
In
a
word
,
he
pledged
himself
to
be
*NL*
mine
,
and
I
promised
to
be
his
,
without
carrying
matters
any
further
.
*NL*
Yesterday
I
learned
that
,
forgetful
of
his
pledge
to
me
,
he
was
about
to
*NL*
marry
another
,
and
that
he
was
to
go
this
morning
to
plight
his
troth
,
*NL*
intelligence
which
overwhelmed
and
exasperated
me
;
my
father
not
being
at
*NL*
home
I
was
able
to
adopt
this
costume
you
see
,
and
urging
my
horse
to
*NL*
speed
I
overtook
Don
Vicente
about
a
league
from
this
,
and
without
*NL*
waiting
to
utter
reproaches
or
hear
excuses
I
fired
this
musket
at
him
,
*NL*
and
these
two
pistols
besides
,
and
to
the
best
of
my
belief
I
must
have
*NL*
lodged
more
than
two
bullets
in
his
body
,
opening
doors
to
let
my
honour
*NL*
go
free
,
enveloped
in
his
blood
.
I
left
him
there
in
the
hands
of
his
*NL*
servants
,
who
did
not
dare
and
were
not
able
to
interfere
in
his
defence
,
*NL*
and
I
come
to
seek
from
thee
a
safe-conduct
into
France
,
where
I
have
*NL*
relatives
with
whom
I
can
live
;
and
also
to
implore
thee
to
protect
my
*NL*
father
,
so
that
Don
Vicente
's
numerous
kinsmen
may
not
venture
to
wreak
*NL*
their
lawless
vengeance
upon
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Roque
,
filled
with
admiration
at
the
gallant
bearing
,
high
spirit
,
comely
*NL*
figure
,
and
adventure
of
the
fair
Claudia
,
said
to
her
,
``
Come
,
senora
,
*NL*
let
us
go
and
see
if
thy
enemy
is
dead
;
and
then
we
will
consider
what
*NL*
will
be
best
for
thee
.
''
Don
Quixote
,
who
had
been
listening
to
what
*NL*
Claudia
said
and
Roque
Guinart
said
in
reply
to
her
,
exclaimed
,
``
Nobody
*NL*
need
trouble
himself
with
the
defence
of
this
lady

for
I
take
it
upon
*NL*
myself

Give
me
my
horse
and
arms
,
and
wait
for
me
here
;
I
will
go
in
*NL*
quest
of
this
knight
,
and
dead
or
alive
I
will
make
him
keep
his
word
*NL*
plighted
to
so
great
beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
need
have
any
doubt
about
that
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
my
master
has
*NL*
a
very
happy
knack
of
matchmaking
;
it
's
not
many
days
since
he
forced
*NL*
another
man
to
marry
,
who
in
the

way
backed
out
of
his
promise
to
*NL*
another
maiden

persecutors
the
enchanters

*NL*
*NL*
Roque
,

was
paying
more
attention
to
the
fair
Claudia
's
adventure
than
*NL*
to
the
words
of
master

did
not
hear
them

ordering
his

squires
to
restore
to
Sancho
everything
they
had
stripped
Dapple
of
,
he
*NL*
directed
them
to
return
to
the
place
where
they
had
been
quartered
during
*NL*
the
night
,
and
then
set
off
with
Claudia
at
full
speed
in
search
of
the
*NL*
wounded
or
slain
Don
Vicente
.
They
reached
the
spot
where
Claudia
met
*NL*
him
,
but
found
nothing
there
save
freshly
spilt
blood
;
looking
all
round
,
*NL*
however
,
they
descried
some
people
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
above
them
,
and
*NL*
concluded
,
as
indeed
it
proved
to
be
,
that
it
was
Don
Vicente
,
whom
*NL*
either
dead
or
alive
his
servants
were
removing
to
attend
to
his
wounds
*NL*
or
to
bury
him
.
They
made
haste
to
overtake
them
,
which
,
as
the
party
*NL*
moved
slowly
,
they
were
able
to
do
with
ease
.
They
found
Don
Vicente
in
*NL*
the
arms
of
his
servants
,
whom
he
was
entreating
in
a
broken
feeble
voice
*NL*
to
leave
him
there
to
die
,
as
the
pain
of
his
wounds
would
not
suffer
him
*NL*
to
go
any
farther
.
Claudia
and
Roque
threw
themselves
off
their
horses
*NL*
and
advanced
towards
him
;
the
servants
were
overawed
by
the
appearance
of
*NL*
Roque
,
and
Claudia
was
moved
by
the
sight
of
Don
Vicente
,
and
going
up
to
*NL*
him
half
tenderly
half
sternly
,
she
seized
his
hand
and
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Hadst
thou
given
me
this
according
to
our
compact
thou
hadst
never
come
*NL*
to
this
pass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wounded
gentleman
opened
his
all
but
closed
eyes
,
and
recognising
*NL*
Claudia
said
,
``
I
see
clearly
,
fair
and
mistaken
lady
,
that
it
is
thou
*NL*
that
hast
slain
me
,
a
punishment
not
merited
or
deserved
by
my
feelings
*NL*
towards
thee
,
for
never
did
I
mean
to
,
nor
could
I
,
wrong
thee
in
thought
*NL*
or
deed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
true
,
then
,
''
said
Claudia
,
``
that
thou
wert
going
this
morning
*NL*
to
marry
Leonora
the
daughter
of
the
rich
Balvastro
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly
not
,
''
replied
Don
Vicente
;
``
my
cruel
fortune
must
have
carried
*NL*
those
tidings
to
thee
to
drive
thee
in
thy
jealousy
to
take
my
life
;
and
*NL*
to
assure
thyself
of
this
,
press
my
hands
and
take
me
for
thy
husband
if
*NL*
thou
wilt
;
I
have
no
better
satisfaction
to
offer
thee
for
the
wrong
thou
*NL*
fanciest
thou
hast
received
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Claudia
wrung
his
hands
,
and
her
own
heart
was
so
wrung
that
she
lay
*NL*
fainting
on
the
bleeding
breast
of
Don
Vicente
,
whom
a
death
spasm
seized
*NL*
the
same
instant
.
Roque
was
in
perplexity
and
knew
not
what
to
do
;
the
*NL*
servants
ran
to
fetch
water
to
sprinkle
their
faces
,
and
brought
some
and
*NL*
bathed
them
with
it
.
Claudia
recovered
from
her
fainting
fit
,
but
not
so
*NL*
Don
Vicente
from
the
paroxysm
that
had
overtaken
him
,
for
his
life
had
*NL*
come
to
an
end
.
On
perceiving
this
,
Claudia
,
when
she
had
convinced
*NL*
herself
that
her
beloved
husband
was
no
more
,
rent
the
air
with
her
sighs
*NL*
and
made
the
heavens
ring
with
her
lamentations
;
she
tore
her
hair
and
*NL*
scattered
it
to
the
winds
,
she
beat
her
face
with
her
hands
and
showed
*NL*
all
the
signs
of
grief
and
sorrow
that
could
be
conceived
to
come
from
an
*NL*
afflicted
heart
.
``
Cruel
,
reckless
woman
!
''
she
cried
,
``
how
easily
wert
*NL*
thou
moved
to
carry
out
a
thought
so
wicked
!
O
furious
force
of
jealousy
,
*NL*
to
what
desperate
lengths
dost
thou
lead
those
that
give
thee
lodging
in
*NL*
their
bosoms
!
O
husband
,
whose
unhappy
fate
in
being
mine
hath
borne
thee
*NL*
from
the
marriage
bed
to
the
grave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
vehement
and
so
piteous
were
the
lamentations
of
Claudia
that
they
*NL*
drew
tears
from
Roque
's
eyes
,
unused
as
they
were
to
shed
them
on
any
*NL*
occasion
.
The
servants
wept
,
Claudia
swooned
away
again
and
again
,
and
*NL*
the
whole
place
seemed
a
field
of
sorrow
and
an
abode
of
misfortune
.
In
*NL*
the
end
Roque
Guinart
directed
Don
Vicente
's
servants
to
carry
his
body
*NL*
to
his
father
's
village
,
which
was
close
by
,
for
burial
.
Claudia
told
him
*NL*
she
meant
to
go
to
a
monastery
of
which
an
aunt
of
hers
was
abbess
,
where
*NL*
she
intended
to
pass
her
life
with
a
better
and
everlasting
spouse
.
He
*NL*
applauded
her
pious
resolution
,
and
offered
to
accompany
her
*NL*
whithersoever
she
wished
,
and
to
protect
her
father
against
the
kinsmen
*NL*
of
Don
Vicente
and
all
the
world
,
should
they
seek
to
injure
him
.
Claudia
*NL*
would
not
on
any
account
allow
him
to
accompany
her
;
and
thanking
him
for
*NL*
his
offers
as
well
as
she
could
,
took
leave
of
him
in
tears
.
The
servants
*NL*
of
Don
Vicente
carried
away
his
body
,
and
Roque
returned
to
his
comrades
,
*NL*
and
so
ended
the
love
of
Claudia
Jeronima
;
but
what
wonder
,
when
it
was
*NL*
the
insuperable
and
cruel
might
of
jealousy
that
wove
the
web
of
her
sad
*NL*
story
?
*NL*
*NL*
Roque
Guinart
found
his
squires
at
the
place
to
which
he
had
ordered
*NL*
them
,
and
Don
Quixote
on
Rocinante
in
the
midst
of
them
delivering
a
*NL*
harangue
to
them
in
which
he
urged
them
to
give
up
a
mode
of
life
so
full
*NL*
of
peril
,
as
well
to
the
soul
as
to
the
body
;
but
as
most
of
them
were
*NL*
Gascons
,
rough
lawless
fellows
,
his
speech
did
not
make
much
impression
*NL*
on
them
.
Roque
on
coming
up
asked
Sancho
if
his
men
had
returned
and
*NL*
restored
to
him
the
treasures
and
jewels
they
had
stripped
off
Dapple
.
*NL*
Sancho
said
they
had
,
but
that
three
kerchiefs
that
were
worth
three
*NL*
cities
were
missing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
talking
about
,
man
?
''
said
one
of
the
bystanders
;
``
I
have
*NL*
got
them
,
and
they
are
not
worth
three
reals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
my
squire
values
them
at
the
rate
*NL*
he
says
,
as
having
been
given
me
by
the
person
who
gave
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Roque
Guinart
ordered
them
to
be
restored
at
once
;
and
making
his
men
*NL*
fall
in
in
line
he
directed
all
the
clothing
,
jewellery
,
and
money
that
*NL*
they
had
taken
since
the
last
distribution
to
be
produced
;
and
making
a
*NL*
hasty
valuation
,
and
reducing
what
could
not
be
divided
into
money
,
he
*NL*
made
shares
for
the
whole
band
so
equitably
and
carefully
,
that
in
no
*NL*
case
did
he
exceed
or
fall
short
of
strict
distributive
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
had
been
done
,
and
all
left
satisfied
,
Roque
observed
to
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
If
this
scrupulous
exactness
were
not
observed
with
these
*NL*
fellows
there
would
be
no
living
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
Sancho
remarked
,
``
From
what
I
have
seen
here
,
justice
is
such
a
*NL*
good
thing
that
there
is
no
doing
without
it
,
even
among
the
thieves
*NL*
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
squires
heard
this
,
and
raising
the
butt-end
of
his
harquebuss
*NL*
would
no
doubt
have
broken
Sancho
's
head
with
it
had
not
Roque
Guinart
*NL*
called
out
to
him
to
hold
his
hand
.
Sancho
was
frightened
out
of
his
*NL*
wits
,
and
vowed
not
to
open
his
lips
so
long
as
he
was
in
the
company
of
*NL*
these
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
one
or
two
of
those
squires
who
were
posted
as
sentinels
*NL*
on
the
roads
,
to
watch
who
came
along
them
and
report
what
passed
to
*NL*
their
chief
,
came
up
and
said
,
``
Senor
,
there
is
a
great
troop
of
people
*NL*
not
far
off
coming
along
the
road
to
Barcelona
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Roque
replied
,
``
Hast
thou
made
out
whether
they
are
of
the
sort
*NL*
that
are
after
us
,
or
of
the
sort
we
are
after
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sort
we
are
after
,
''
said
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
away
with
you
all
,
''
said
Roque
,
``
and
bring
them
here
to
me
at
*NL*
once
without
letting
one
of
them
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
obeyed
,
and
Don
Quixote
,
Sancho
,
and
Roque
,
left
by
themselves
,
*NL*
waited
to
see
what
the
squires
brought
,
and
while
they
were
waiting
Roque
*NL*
said
to
Don
Quixote
,
``
It
must
seem
a
strange
sort
of
life
to
Senor
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
this
of
ours
,
strange
adventures
,
strange
incidents
,
and
all
*NL*
full
of
danger
;
and
I
do
not
wonder
that
it
should
seem
so
,
for
in
truth
*NL*
I
must
own
there
is
no
mode
of
life
more
restless
or
anxious
than
ours
.
*NL*
What
led
me
into
it
was
a
certain
thirst
for
vengeance
,
which
is
strong
*NL*
enough
to
disturb
the
quietest
hearts
.
I
am
by
nature
tender-hearted
and
*NL*
kindly
,
but
,
as
I
said
,
the
desire
to
revenge
myself
for
a
wrong
that
was
*NL*
done
me
so
overturns
all
my
better
impulses
that
I
keep
on
in
this
way
of
*NL*
life
in
spite
of
what
conscience
tells
me
;
and
as
one
depth
calls
to
*NL*
another
,
and
one
sin
to
another
sin
,
revenges
have
linked
themselves
*NL*
together
,
and
I
have
taken
upon
myself
not
only
my
own
but
those
of
*NL*
others
:
it
pleases
God
,
however
,
that
,
though
I
see
myself
in
this
maze
*NL*
of
entanglements
,
I
do
not
lose
all
hope
of
escaping
from
it
and
reaching
*NL*
a
safe
port
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
amazed
to
hear
Roque
utter
such
excellent
and
just
*NL*
sentiments
,
for
he
did
not
think
that
among
those
who
followed
such
*NL*
trades
as
robbing
,
murdering
,
and
waylaying
,
there
could
be
anyone
*NL*
capable
of
a
virtuous
thought
,
and
he
said
in
reply
,
``
Senor
Roque
,
the
*NL*
beginning
of
health
lies
in
knowing
the
disease
and
in
the
sick
man
's
*NL*
willingness
to
take
the
medicines
which
the
physician
prescribes
;
you
are
*NL*
sick
,
you
know
what
ails
you
,
and
heaven
,
or
more
properly
speaking
God
,
*NL*
who
is
our
physician
,
will
administer
medicines
that
will
cure
you
,
and
*NL*
cure
gradually
,
and
not
of
a
sudden
or
by
a
miracle
;
besides
,
sinners
of
*NL*
discernment
are
nearer
amendment
than
those
who
are
fools
;
and
as
your
*NL*
worship
has
shown
good
sense
in
your
remarks
,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
*NL*
keep
up
a
good
heart
and
trust
that
the
weakness
of
your
conscience
will
*NL*
be
strengthened
.
And
if
you
have
any
desire
to
shorten
the
journey
and
*NL*
put
yourself
easily
in
the
way
of
salvation
,
come
with
me
,
and
I
will
*NL*
show
you
how
to
become
a
knight-errant
,
a
calling
wherein
so
many
*NL*
hardships
and
mishaps
are
encountered
that
if
they
be
taken
as
penances
*NL*
they
will
lodge
you
in
heaven
in
a
trice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Roque
laughed
at
Don
Quixote
's
exhortation
,
and
changing
the
conversation
*NL*
he
related
the
tragic
affair
of
Claudia
Jeronima
,
at
which
Sancho
was
*NL*
extremely
grieved
;
for
he
had
not
found
the
young
woman
's
beauty
,
*NL*
boldness
,
and
spirit
at
all
amiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
squires
despatched
to
make
the
prize
came
up
,
bringing
with
*NL*
them
two
gentlemen
on
horseback
,
two
pilgrims
on
foot
,
and
a
coach
full
*NL*
of
women
with
some
six
servants
on
foot
and
on
horseback
in
attendance
on
*NL*
them
,
and
a
couple
of
muleteers
whom
the
gentlemen
had
with
them
.
The
*NL*
squires
made
a
ring
round
them
,
both
victors
and
vanquished
maintaining
*NL*
profound
silence
,
waiting
for
the
great
Roque
Guinart
to
speak
.
He
asked
*NL*
the
gentlemen
who
they
were
,
whither
they
were
going
,
and
what
money
they
*NL*
carried
with
them
;
``
Senor
,
''
replied
one
of
them
,
``
we
are
two
captains
of
*NL*
Spanish
infantry
;
our
companies
are
at
Naples
,
and
we
are
on
our
way
to
*NL*
embark
in
four
galleys
which
they
say
are
at
Barcelona
under
orders
for
*NL*
Sicily
;
and
we
have
about
two
or
three
hundred
crowns
,
with
which
we
are
,
*NL*
according
to
our
notions
,
rich
and
contented
,
for
a
soldier
's
poverty
*NL*
does
not
allow
a
more
extensive
hoard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Roque
asked
the
pilgrims
the
same
questions
he
had
put
to
the
captains
,
*NL*
and
was
answered
that
they
were
going
to
take
ship
for
Rome
,
and
that
*NL*
between
them
they
might
have
about
sixty
reals
.
He
asked
also
who
was
in
*NL*
the
coach
,
whither
they
were
bound
and
what
money
they
had
,
and
one
of
*NL*
the
men
on
horseback
replied
,
``
The
persons
in
the
coach
are
my
lady
Dona
*NL*
Guiomar
de
Quinones
,
wife
of
the
regent
of
the
Vicaria
at
Naples
,
her
*NL*
little
daughter
,
a
handmaid
and
a
duenna
;
we
six
servants
are
in
*NL*
attendance
upon
her
,
and
the
money
amounts
to
six
hundred
crowns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
,
''
said
Roque
Guinart
,
``
we
have
got
here
nine
hundred
crowns
and
*NL*
sixty
reals
;
my
soldiers
must
number
some
sixty
;
see
how
much
there
falls
*NL*
to
each
,
for
I
am
a
bad
arithmetician
.
''
As
soon
as
the
robbers
heard
this
*NL*
they
raised
a
shout
of
``
Long
life
to
Roque
Guinart
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
lladres
that
seek
his
ruin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captains
showed
plainly
the
concern
they
felt
,
the
regent
's
lady
was
*NL*
downcast
,
and
the
pilgrims
did
not
at
all
enjoy
seeing
their
property
*NL*
confiscated
.
Roque
kept
them
in
suspense
in
this
way
for
a
while
;
but
he
*NL*
had
no
desire
to
prolong
their
distress
,
which
might
be
seen
a
bowshot
*NL*
off
,
and
turning
to
the
captains
he
said
,
``
Sirs
,
will
your
worships
be
*NL*
pleased
of
your
courtesy
to
lend
me
sixty
crowns
,
and
her
ladyship
the
*NL*
regent
's
wife
eighty
,
to
satisfy
this
band
that
follows
me
,
for
`
it
is
by
*NL*
his
singing
the
abbot
gets
his
dinner
;
'
and
then
you
may
at
once
proceed
*NL*
on
your
journey
,
free
and
unhindered
,
with
a
safe-conduct
which
I
shall
*NL*
give
you
,
so
that
if
you
come
across
any
other
bands
of
mine
that
I
have
*NL*
scattered
in
these
parts
,
they
may
do
you
no
harm
;
for
I
have
no
*NL*
intention
of
doing
injury
to
soldiers
,
or
to
any
woman
,
especially
one
of
*NL*
quality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Profuse
and
hearty
were
the
expressions
of
gratitude
with
which
the
*NL*
captains
thanked
Roque
for
his
courtesy
and
generosity
;
for
such
they
*NL*
regarded
his
leaving
them
their
own
money
.
Senora
Dona
Guiomar
de
*NL*
Quinones
wanted
to
throw
herself
out
of
the
coach
to
kiss
the
feet
and
*NL*
hands
of
the
great
Roque
,
but
he
would
not
suffer
it
on
any
account
;
so
*NL*
far
from
that
,
he
begged
her
pardon
for
the
wrong
he
had
done
her
under
*NL*
pressure
of
the
inexorable
necessities
of
his
unfortunate
calling
.
The
*NL*
regent
's
lady
ordered
one
of
her
servants
to
give
the
eighty
crowns
that
*NL*
had
been
assessed
as
her
share
at
once
,
for
the
captains
had
already
paid
*NL*
down
their
sixty
.
The
pilgrims
were
about
to
give
up
the
whole
of
their
*NL*
little
hoard
,
but
Roque
bade
them
keep
quiet
,
and
turning
to
his
men
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Of
these
crowns
two
fall
to
each
man
and
twenty
remain
over
;
let
*NL*
ten
be
given
to
these
pilgrims
,
and
the
other
ten
to
this
worthy
squire
*NL*
that
he
may
be
able
to
speak
favourably
of
this
adventure
;
''
and
then
*NL*
having
writing
materials
,
with
which
he
always
went
provided
,
brought
to
*NL*
him
,
he
gave
them
in
writing
a
safe-conduct
to
the
leaders
of
his
bands
;
*NL*
and
bidding
them
farewell
let
them
go
free
and
filled
with
admiration
at
*NL*
his
magnanimity
,
his
generous
disposition
,
and
his
unusual
conduct
,
and
*NL*
inclined
to
regard
him
as
an
Alexander
the
Great
rather
than
a
notorious
*NL*
robber
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
squires
observed
in
his
mixture
of
Gascon
and
Catalan
,
``
This
*NL*
captain
of
ours
would
make
a
better
friar
than
highwayman
;
if
he
wants
to
*NL*
be
so
generous
another
time
,
let
it
be
with
his
own
property
and
not
*NL*
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unlucky
wight
did
not
speak
so
low
but
that
Roque
overheard
him
,
and
*NL*
drawing
his
sword
almost
split
his
head
in
two
,
saying
,
``
That
is
the
way
*NL*
I
punish
impudent
saucy
fellows
.
''
They
were
all
taken
aback
,
and
not
one
*NL*
of
them
dared
to
utter
a
word
,
such
deference
did
they
pay
him
.
Roque
*NL*
then
withdrew
to
one
side
and
wrote
a
letter
to
a
friend
of
his
at
*NL*
Barcelona
,
telling
him
that
the
famous
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
the
*NL*
knight-errant
of
whom
there
was
so
much
talk
,
was
with
him
,
and
was
,
he
*NL*
assured
him
,
the
drollest
and
wisest
man
in
the
world
;
and
that
in
four
*NL*
days
from
that
date
,
that
is
to
say
,
on
Saint
John
the
Baptist
's
Day
,
he
*NL*
was
going
to
deposit
him
in
full
armour
mounted
on
his
horse
Rocinante
,
*NL*
together
with
his
squire
Sancho
on
an
ass
,
in
the
middle
of
the
strand
of
*NL*
the
city
;
and
bidding
him
give
notice
of
this
to
his
friends
the
Niarros
,
*NL*
that
they
might
divert
themselves
with
him
.
He
wished
,
he
said
,
his
*NL*
enemies
the
Cadells
could
be
deprived
of
this
pleasure
;
but
that
was
*NL*
impossible
,
because
the
crazes
and
shrewd
sayings
of
Don
Quixote
and
the
*NL*
humours
of
his
squire
Sancho
Panza
could
not
help
giving
general
pleasure
*NL*
to
all
the
world
.
He
despatched
the
letter
by
one
of
his
squires
,
who
,
*NL*
exchanging
the
costume
of
a
highwayman
for
that
of
a
peasant
,
made
his
*NL*
way
into
Barcelona
and
gave
it
to
the
person
to
whom
it
was
directed
.

CHAPTER
LXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
DON
QUIXOTE
ON
ENTERING
BARCELONA
,
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
*NL*
MATTERS
THAT
PARTAKE
OF
THE
TRUE
RATHER
THAN
OF
THE
INGENIOUS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
passed
three
days
and
three
nights
with
Roque
,
and
had
he
*NL*
passed
three
hundred
years
he
would
have
found
enough
to
observe
and
*NL*
wonder
at
in
his
mode
of
life
.
At
daybreak
they
were
in
one
spot
,
at
*NL*
dinner-time
in
another
;
sometimes
they
fled
without
knowing
from
whom
,
at
*NL*
other
times
they
lay
in
wait
,
not
knowing
for
what
.
They
slept
standing
,
*NL*
breaking
their
slumbers
to
shift
from
place
to
place
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
but
sending
out
spies
and
scouts
,
posting
sentinels
and
blowing
the
*NL*
matches
of
harquebusses
,
though
they
carried
but
few
,
for
almost
all
used
*NL*
flintlocks
.
Roque
passed
his
nights
in
some
place
or
other
apart
from
his
*NL*
men
,
that
they
might
not
know
where
he
was
,
for
the
many
proclamations
*NL*
the
viceroy
of
Barcelona
had
issued
against
his
life
kept
him
in
fear
and
*NL*
uneasiness
,
and
he
did
not
venture
to
trust
anyone
,
afraid
that
even
his
*NL*
own
men
would
kill
him
or
deliver
him
up
to
the
authorities
;
of
a
truth
,
*NL*
a
weary
miserable
life
!
At
length
,
by
unfrequented
roads
,
short
cuts
,
and
*NL*
secret
paths
,
Roque
,
Don
Quixote
,
and
Sancho
,
together
with
six
squires
,
*NL*
set
out
for
Barcelona
.
They
reached
the
strand
on
Saint
John
's
Eve
during
*NL*
the
night
;
and
Roque
,
after
embracing
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
-LRB-
to
whom
he
*NL*
presented
the
ten
crowns
he
had
promised
but
had
not
until
then
given
-RRB-
,
*NL*
left
them
with
many
expressions
of
good-will
on
both
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Roque
went
back
,
while
Don
Quixote
remained
on
horseback
,
just
as
he
was
,
*NL*
waiting
for
day
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
countenance
of
the
fair
*NL*
Aurora
began
to
show
itself
at
the
balconies
of
the
east
,
gladdening
the
*NL*
grass
and
flowers
,
if
not
the
ear
,
though
to
gladden
that
too
there
came
*NL*
at
the
same
moment
a
sound
of
clarions
and
drums
,
and
a
din
of
bells
,
and
*NL*
a
tramp
,
tramp
,
and
cries
of
``
Clear
the
way
there
!
''
of
some
runners
,
that
*NL*
seemed
to
issue
from
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dawn
made
way
for
the
sun
that
with
a
face
broader
than
a
buckler
*NL*
began
to
rise
slowly
above
the
low
line
of
the
horizon
;
Don
Quixote
and
*NL*
Sancho
gazed
all
round
them
;
they
beheld
the
sea
,
a
sight
until
then
*NL*
unseen
by
them
;
it
struck
them
as
exceedingly
spacious
and
broad
,
much
*NL*
more
so
than
the
lakes
of
Ruidera
which
they
had
seen
in
La
Mancha
.
They
*NL*
saw
the
galleys
along
the
beach
,
which
,
lowering
their
awnings
,
displayed
*NL*
themselves
decked
with
streamers
and
pennons
that
trembled
in
the
breeze
*NL*
and
kissed
and
swept
the
water
,
while
on
board
the
bugles
,
trumpets
,
and
*NL*
clarions
were
sounding
and
filling
the
air
far
and
near
with
melodious
*NL*
warlike
notes
.
Then
they
began
to
move
and
execute
a
kind
of
skirmish
*NL*
upon
the
calm
water
,
while
a
vast
number
of
horsemen
on
fine
horses
and
*NL*
in
showy
liveries
,
issuing
from
the
city
,
engaged
on
their
side
in
a
*NL*
somewhat
similar
movement
.
The
soldiers
on
board
the
galleys
kept
up
a
*NL*
ceaseless
fire
,
which
they
on
the
walls
and
forts
of
the
city
returned
,
*NL*
and
the
heavy
cannon
rent
the
air
with
the
tremendous
noise
they
made
,
to
*NL*
which
the
gangway
guns
of
the
galleys
replied
.
The
bright
sea
,
the
*NL*
smiling
earth
,
the
clear
air
--
though
at
times
darkened
by
the
smoke
of
*NL*
the
guns
--
all
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
multitude
with
unexpected
delight
.
*NL*
Sancho
could
not
make
out
how
it
was
that
those
great
masses
that
moved
*NL*
over
the
sea
had
so
many
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
horsemen
in
livery
came
galloping
up
with
shouts
and
*NL*
outlandish
cries
and
cheers
to
where
Don
Quixote
stood
amazed
and
*NL*
wondering
;
and
one
of
them
,
he
to
whom
Roque
had
sent
word
,
addressing
*NL*
him
exclaimed
,
``
Welcome
to
our
city
,
mirror
,
beacon
,
star
and
cynosure
of
*NL*
all
knight-errantry
in
its
widest
extent
!
Welcome
,
I
say
,
valiant
Don
*NL*
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
;
not
the
false
,
the
fictitious
,
the
apocryphal
,
that
*NL*
these
latter
days
have
offered
us
in
lying
histories
,
but
the
true
,
the
*NL*
legitimate
,
the
real
one
that
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
,
flower
of
*NL*
historians
,
has
described
to
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
made
no
answer
,
nor
did
the
horsemen
wait
for
one
,
but
*NL*
wheeling
again
with
all
their
followers
,
they
began
curvetting
round
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
who
,
turning
to
Sancho
,
said
,
``
These
gentlemen
have
plainly
*NL*
recognised
us
;
I
will
wager
they
have
read
our
history
,
and
even
that
*NL*
newly
printed
one
by
the
Aragonese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cavalier
who
had
addressed
Don
Quixote
again
approached
him
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Come
with
us
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
for
we
are
all
of
us
your
servants
and
*NL*
great
friends
of
Roque
Guinart
's
;
''
to
which
Don
Quixote
returned
,
``
If
*NL*
courtesy
breeds
courtesy
,
yours
,
sir
knight
,
is
daughter
or
very
nearly
*NL*
akin
to
the
great
Roque
's
;
carry
me
where
you
please
;
I
will
have
no
will
*NL*
but
yours
,
especially
if
you
deign
to
employ
it
in
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cavalier
replied
with
words
no
less
polite
,
and
then
,
all
closing
in
*NL*
around
him
,
they
set
out
with
him
for
the
city
,
to
the
music
of
the
*NL*
clarions
and
the
drums
.
As
they
were
entering
it
,
the
wicked
one
,
who
is
*NL*
the
author
of
all
mischief
,
and
the
boys
who
are
wickeder
than
the
wicked
*NL*
one
,
contrived
that
a
couple
of
these
audacious
irrepressible
urchins
*NL*
should
force
their
way
through
the
crowd
,
and
lifting
up
,
one
of
them
*NL*
Dapple
's
tail
and
the
other
Rocinante
's
,
insert
a
bunch
of
furze
under
*NL*
each
.
The
poor
beasts
felt
the
strange
spurs
and
added
to
their
anguish
*NL*
by
pressing
their
tails
tight
,
so
much
so
that
,
cutting
a
multitude
of
*NL*
capers
,
they
flung
their
masters
to
the
ground
.
Don
Quixote
,
covered
with
*NL*
shame
and
out
of
countenance
,
ran
to
pluck
the
plume
from
his
poor
jade
's
*NL*
tail
,
while
Sancho
did
the
same
for
Dapple
.
His
conductors
tried
to
*NL*
punish
the
audacity
of
the
boys
,
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
doing
*NL*
so
,
for
they
hid
themselves
among
the
hundreds
of
others
that
were
*NL*
following
them
.
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
mounted
once
more
,
and
with
the
*NL*
same
music
and
acclamations
reached
their
conductor
's
house
,
which
was
*NL*
large
and
stately
,
that
of
a
rich
gentleman
,
in
short
;
and
there
for
the
*NL*
present
we
will
leave
them
,
for
such
is
Cide
Hamete
's
pleasure

LXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
DEALS
WITH
THE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
ENCHANTED
HEAD
,
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
*NL*
TRIVIAL
MATTERS
WHICH
CAN
NOT
BE
LEFT
UNTOLD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
's
host
was
one
Don
Antonio
Moreno
by
name
,
a
gentleman
of
*NL*
wealth
and
intelligence
,
and
very
fond
of
diverting
himself
in
any
fair
*NL*
and
good-natured
way
;
and
having
Don
Quixote
in
his
house
he
set
about
*NL*
devising
modes
of
making
him
exhibit
his
mad
points
in
some
harmless
*NL*
fashion
;
for
jests
that
give
pain
are
no
jests
,
and
no
sport
is
worth
*NL*
anything
if
it
hurts
another
.
The
first
thing
he
did
was
to
make
Don
*NL*
Quixote
take
off
his
armour
,
and
lead
him
,
in
that
tight
chamois
suit
we
*NL*
have
already
described
and
depicted
more
than
once
,
out
on
a
balcony
*NL*
overhanging
one
of
the
chief
streets
of
the
city
,
in
full
view
of
the
*NL*
crowd
and
of
the
boys
,
who
gazed
at
him
as
they
would
at
a
monkey
.
The
*NL*
cavaliers
in
livery
careered
before
him
again
as
though
it
were
for
him
*NL*
alone
,
and
not
to
enliven
the
festival
of
the
day
,
that
they
wore
it
,
and
*NL*
Sancho
was
in
high
delight
,
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
,
how
he
knew
not
,
*NL*
he
had
fallen
upon
another
Camacho
's
wedding
,
another
house
like
Don
*NL*
Diego
de
Miranda
's
,
another
castle
like
the
duke
's
.
Some
of
Don
Antonio
's
*NL*
friends
dined
with
him
that
day
,
and
all
showed
honour
to
Don
Quixote
and
*NL*
treated
him
as
a
knight-errant
,
and
he
becoming
puffed
up
and
exalted
in
*NL*
consequence
could
not
contain
himself
for
satisfaction
.
Such
were
the
*NL*
drolleries
of
Sancho
that
all
the
servants
of
the
house
,
and
all
who
*NL*
heard
him
,
were
kept
hanging
upon
his
lips
.
While
at
table
Don
Antonio
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
We
hear
,
worthy
Sancho
,
that
you
are
so
fond
of
manjar
*NL*
blanco
and
forced-meat
balls
,
that
if
you
have
any
left
,
you
keep
them
in
*NL*
your
bosom
for
the
next
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
senor
,
that
's
not
true
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
I
am
more
cleanly
than
*NL*
greedy
,
and
my
master
Don
Quixote
here
knows
well
that
we
two
are
used
to
*NL*
live
for
a
week
on
a
handful
of
acorns
or
nuts
.
To
be
sure
,
if
it
so
*NL*
happens
that
they
offer
me
a
heifer
,
I
run
with
a
halter
;
I
mean
,
I
eat
*NL*
what
I
'm
given
,
and
make
use
of
opportunities
as
I
find
them
;
but
whoever
*NL*
says
that
I
'm
an
out-of-the-way
eater
or
not
cleanly
,
let
me
tell
him
*NL*
that
he
is
wrong
;
and
I
'd
put
it
in
a
different
way
if
I
did
not
respect
*NL*
the
honourable
beards
that
are
at
the
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
Sancho
's
moderation
and
cleanliness
in
*NL*
eating
might
be
inscribed
and
graved
on
plates
of
brass
,
to
be
kept
in
*NL*
eternal
remembrance
in
ages
to
come
.
It
is
true
that
when
he
is
hungry
*NL*
there
is
a
certain
appearance
of
voracity
about
him
,
for
he
eats
at
a
*NL*
great
pace
and
chews
with
both
jaws
;
but
cleanliness
he
is
always
mindful
*NL*
of
;
and
when
he
was
governor
he
learned
how
to
eat
daintily
,
so
much
so
*NL*
that
he
eats
grapes
,
and
even
pomegranate
pips
,
with
a
fork
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Don
Antonio
,
``
has
Sancho
been
a
governor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
and
of
an
island
called
Barataria
.
I
governed
it
to
*NL*
perfection
for
ten
days
;
and
lost
my
rest
all
the
time
;
and
learned
to
*NL*
look
down
upon
all
the
governments
in
the
world
;
I
got
out
of
it
by
*NL*
taking
to
flight
,
and
fell
into
a
pit
where
I
gave
myself
up
for
dead
,
*NL*
and
out
of
which
I
escaped
alive
by
a
miracle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
then
gave
them
a
minute
account
of
the
whole
affair
of
*NL*
Sancho
's
government
,
with
which
he
greatly
amused
his
hearers
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
cloth
being
removed
Don
Antonio
,
taking
Don
Quixote
by
the
hand
,
*NL*
passed
with
him
into
a
distant
room
in
which
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
*NL*
of
furniture
except
a
table
,
apparently
of
jasper
,
resting
on
a
pedestal
*NL*
of
the
same
,
upon
which
was
set
up
,
after
the
fashion
of
the
busts
of
the
*NL*
Roman
emperors
,
a
head
which
seemed
to
be
of
bronze
.
Don
Antonio
*NL*
traversed
the
whole
apartment
with
Don
Quixote
and
walked
round
the
table
*NL*
several
times
,
and
then
said
,
``
Now
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
that
I
am
*NL*
satisfied
that
no
one
is
listening
to
us
,
and
that
the
door
is
shut
,
I
*NL*
will
tell
you
of
one
of
the
rarest
adventures
,
or
more
properly
speaking
*NL*
strange
things
,
that
can
be
imagined
,
on
condition
that
you
will
keep
*NL*
what
I
say
to
you
in
the
remotest
recesses
of
secrecy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
for
greater
security
I
will
put
a
*NL*
flag-stone
over
it
;
for
I
would
have
you
know
,
Senor
Don
Antonio
''
-LRB-
he
had
*NL*
by
this
time
learned
his
name
-RRB-
,
``
that
you
are
addressing
one
who
,
though
*NL*
he
has
ears
to
hear
,
has
no
tongue
to
speak
;
so
that
you
may
safely
*NL*
transfer
whatever
you
have
in
your
bosom
into
mine
,
and
rely
upon
it
that
*NL*
you
have
consigned
it
to
the
depths
of
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
reliance
upon
that
promise
,
''
said
Don
Antonio
,
``
I
will
astonish
you
*NL*
with
what
you
shall
see
and
hear
,
and
relieve
myself
of
some
of
the
*NL*
vexation
it
gives
me
to
have
no
one
to
whom
I
can
confide
my
secrets
,
for
*NL*
they
are
not
of
a
sort
to
be
entrusted
to
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
puzzled
,
wondering
what
could
be
the
object
of
such
*NL*
precautions
;
whereupon
Don
Antonio
taking
his
hand
passed
it
over
the
*NL*
bronze
head
and
the
whole
table
and
the
pedestal
of
jasper
on
which
it
*NL*
stood
,
and
then
said
,
``
This
head
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
has
been
made
and
*NL*
fabricated
by
one
of
the
greatest
magicians
and
wizards
the
world
ever
*NL*
saw
,
a
Pole
,
I
believe
,
by
birth
,
and
a
pupil
of
the
famous
Escotillo
of
*NL*
whom
such
marvellous
stories
are
told
.
He
was
here
in
my
house
,
and
for
a
*NL*
consideration
of
a
thousand
crowns
that
I
gave
him
he
constructed
this
*NL*
head
,
which
has
the
property
and
virtue
of
answering
whatever
questions
*NL*
are
put
to
its
ear
.
He
observed
the
points
of
the
compass
,
he
traced
*NL*
figures
,
he
studied
the
stars
,
he
watched
favourable
moments
,
and
at
*NL*
length
brought
it
to
the
perfection
we
shall
see
to-morrow
,
for
on
*NL*
Fridays
it
is
mute
,
and
this
being
Friday
we
must
wait
till
the
next
day
.
*NL*
In
the
interval
your
worship
may
consider
what
you
would
like
to
ask
it
;
*NL*
and
I
know
by
experience
that
in
all
its
answers
it
tells
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
amazed
at
the
virtue
and
property
of
the
head
,
and
was
*NL*
inclined
to
disbelieve
Don
Antonio
;
but
seeing
what
a
short
time
he
had
*NL*
to
wait
to
test
the
matter
,
he
did
not
choose
to
say
anything
except
that
*NL*
he
thanked
him
for
having
revealed
to
him
so
mighty
a
secret
.
They
then
*NL*
quitted
the
room
,
Don
Antonio
locked
the
door
,
and
they
repaired
to
the
*NL*
chamber
where
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
were
assembled
.
In
the
meantime
*NL*
Sancho
had
recounted
to
them
several
of
the
adventures
and
accidents
that
*NL*
had
happened
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
they
took
Don
Quixote
out
for
a
stroll
,
not
in
his
armour
*NL*
but
in
street
costume
,
with
a
surcoat
of
tawny
cloth
upon
him
,
that
at
*NL*
that
season
would
have
made
ice
itself
sweat
.
Orders
were
left
with
the
*NL*
servants
to
entertain
Sancho
so
as
not
to
let
him
leave
the
house
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
mounted
,
not
on
Rocinante
,
but
upon
a
tall
mule
of
easy
pace
*NL*
and
handsomely
caparisoned
.
They
put
the
surcoat
on
him
,
and
on
the
back
,
*NL*
without
his
perceiving
it
,
they
stitched
a
parchment
on
which
they
wrote
*NL*
in
large
letters
,
``
This
is
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
.
''
As
they
set
out
*NL*
upon
their
excursion
the
placard
attracted
the
eyes
of
all
who
chanced
to
*NL*
see
him
,
and
as
they
read
out
,
``
This
is
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
''
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
amazed
to
see
how
many
people
gazed
at
him
,
called
him
by
his
*NL*
name
,
and
recognised
him
,
and
turning
to
Don
Antonio
,
who
rode
at
his
*NL*
side
,
he
observed
to
him
,
``
Great
are
the
privileges
knight-errantry
*NL*
involves
,
for
it
makes
him
who
professes
it
known
and
famous
in
every
*NL*
region
of
the
earth
;
see
,
Don
Antonio
,
even
the
very
boys
of
this
city
*NL*
know
me
without
ever
having
seen
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
,
''
returned
Don
Antonio
;
``
for
as
fire
can
not
be
*NL*
hidden
or
kept
secret
,
virtue
can
not
escape
being
recognised
;
and
that
*NL*
which
is
attained
by
the
profession
of
arms
shines
distinguished
above
*NL*
all
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
to
pass
,
however
,
that
as
Don
Quixote
was
proceeding
amid
the
*NL*
acclamations
that
have
been
described
,
a
Castilian
,
reading
the
*NL*
inscription
on
his
back
,
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
,
``
The
devil
take
thee
*NL*
for
a
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
!
What
!
art
thou
here
,
and
not
dead
of
the
*NL*
countless
drubbings
that
have
fallen
on
thy
ribs
?
Thou
art
mad
;
and
if
*NL*
thou
wert
so
by
thyself
,
and
kept
thyself
within
thy
madness
,
it
would
*NL*
not
be
so
bad
;
but
thou
hast
the
gift
of
making
fools
and
blockheads
of
*NL*
all
who
have
anything
to
do
with
thee
or
say
to
thee
.
Why
,
look
at
these
*NL*
gentlemen
bearing
thee
company
!
Get
thee
home
,
blockhead
,
and
see
after
*NL*
thy
affairs
,
and
thy
wife
and
children
,
and
give
over
these
fooleries
*NL*
that
are
sapping
thy
brains
and
skimming
away
thy
wits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
your
own
way
,
brother
,
''
said
Don
Antonio
,
``
and
do
n't
offer
advice
to
*NL*
those
who
do
n't
ask
you
for
it
.
Senor
Don
Quixote
is
in
his
full
senses
,
*NL*
and
we
who
bear
him
company
are
not
fools
;
virtue
is
to
be
honoured
*NL*
wherever
it
may
be
found
;
go
,
and
bad
luck
to
you
,
and
do
n't
meddle
where
*NL*
you
are
not
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
,
your
worship
is
right
,
''
replied
the
Castilian
;
``
for
to
advise
*NL*
this
good
man
is
to
kick
against
the
pricks
;
still
for
all
that
it
fills
*NL*
me
with
pity
that
the
sound
wit
they
say
the
blockhead
has
in
everything
*NL*
should
dribble
away
by
the
channel
of
his
knight-errantry
;
but
may
the
*NL*
bad
luck
your
worship
talks
of
follow
me
and
all
my
descendants
,
if
,
from
*NL*
this
day
forth
,
though
I
should
live
longer
than
Methuselah
,
I
ever
give
*NL*
advice
to
anybody
even
if
he
asks
me
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
advice-giver
took
himself
off
,
and
they
continued
their
stroll
;
but
*NL*
so
great
was
the
press
of
the
boys
and
people
to
read
the
placard
,
that
*NL*
Don
Antonio
was
forced
to
remove
it
as
if
he
were
taking
off
something
*NL*
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
came
and
they
went
home
,
and
there
was
a
ladies
'
dancing
party
,
for
*NL*
Don
Antonio
's
wife
,
a
lady
of
rank
and
gaiety
,
beauty
and
wit
,
had
*NL*
invited
some
friends
of
hers
to
come
and
do
honour
to
her
guest
and
amuse
*NL*
themselves
with
his
strange
delusions
.
Several
of
them
came
,
they
supped
*NL*
sumptuously
,
the
dance
began
at
about
ten
o'clock
.
Among
the
ladies
were
*NL*
two
of
a
mischievous
and
frolicsome
turn
,
and
,
though
perfectly
modest
,
*NL*
somewhat
free
in
playing
tricks
for
harmless
diversion
's
sake
.
These
two
*NL*
were
so
indefatigable
in
taking
Don
Quixote
out
to
dance
that
they
tired
*NL*
him
down
,
not
only
in
body
but
in
spirit
.
It
was
a
sight
to
see
the
*NL*
figure
Don
Quixote
made
,
long
,
lank
,
lean
,
and
yellow
,
his
garments
*NL*
clinging
tight
to
him
,
ungainly
,
and
above
all
anything
but
agile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gay
ladies
made
secret
love
to
him
,
and
he
on
his
part
secretly
*NL*
repelled
them
,
but
finding
himself
hard
pressed
by
their
blandishments
he
*NL*
lifted
up
his
voice
and
exclaimed
,
``
Fugite
,
partes
adversae
!
Leave
me
in
*NL*
peace
,
unwelcome
overtures
;
avaunt
,
with
your
desires
,
ladies
,
for
she
*NL*
who
is
queen
of
mine
,
the
peerless
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
suffers
none
but
*NL*
hers
to
lead
me
captive
and
subdue
me
;
''
and
so
saying
he
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
tired
out
and
broken
down
by
all
this
*NL*
exertion
in
the
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Antonio
directed
him
to
be
taken
up
bodily
and
carried
to
bed
,
and
*NL*
the
first
that
laid
hold
of
him
was
Sancho
,
saying
as
he
did
so
,
``
In
an
*NL*
evil
hour
you
took
to
dancing
,
master
mine
;
do
you
fancy
all
mighty
men
*NL*
of
valour
are
dancers
,
and
all
knights-errant
given
to
capering
?
If
you
*NL*
do
,
I
can
tell
you
you
are
mistaken
;
there
's
many
a
man
would
rather
*NL*
undertake
to
kill
a
giant
than
cut
a
caper
.
If
it
had
been
the
shoe-fling
*NL*
you
were
at
I
could
take
your
place
,
for
I
can
do
the
shoe-fling
like
a
*NL*
gerfalcon
;
but
I
'm
no
good
at
dancing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
and
other
observations
Sancho
set
the
whole
ball-room
*NL*
laughing
,
and
then
put
his
master
to
bed
,
covering
him
up
well
so
that
he
*NL*
might
sweat
out
any
chill
caught
after
his
dancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Don
Antonio
thought
he
might
as
well
make
trial
of
the
*NL*
enchanted
head
,
and
with
Don
Quixote
,
Sancho
,
and
two
others
,
friends
of
*NL*
his
,
besides
the
two
ladies
that
had
tired
out
Don
Quixote
at
the
ball
,
*NL*
who
had
remained
for
the
night
with
Don
Antonio
's
wife
,
he
locked
himself
*NL*
up
in
the
chamber
where
the
head
was
.
He
explained
to
them
the
property
*NL*
it
possessed
and
entrusted
the
secret
to
them
,
telling
them
that
now
for
*NL*
the
first
time
he
was
going
to
try
the
virtue
of
the
enchanted
head
;
but
*NL*
except
Don
Antonio
's
two
friends
no
one
else
was
privy
to
the
mystery
of
*NL*
the
enchantment
,
and
if
Don
Antonio
had
not
first
revealed
it
to
them
*NL*
they
would
have
been
inevitably
reduced
to
the
same
state
of
amazement
as
*NL*
the
rest
,
so
artfully
and
skilfully
was
it
contrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
to
approach
the
ear
of
the
head
was
Don
Antonio
himself
,
and
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
but
not
so
low
as
not
to
be
audible
to
all
,
he
said
to
it
,
*NL*
``
Head
,
tell
me
by
the
virtue
that
lies
in
thee
what
am
I
at
this
moment
*NL*
thinking
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
head
,
without
any
movement
of
the
lips
,
answered
in
a
clear
and
*NL*
distinct
voice
,
so
as
to
be
heard
by
all
,
``
I
can
not
judge
of
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
thunderstruck
at
this
,
and
all
the
more
so
as
they
saw
that
*NL*
there
was
nobody
anywhere
near
the
table
or
in
the
whole
room
that
could
*NL*
have
answered
.
``
How
many
of
us
are
here
?
''
asked
Don
Antonio
once
more
;
*NL*
and
it
was
answered
him
in
the
same
way
softly
,
``
Thou
and
thy
wife
,
with
*NL*
two
friends
of
thine
and
two
of
hers
,
and
a
famous
knight
called
Don
*NL*
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
and
a
squire
of
his
,
Sancho
Panza
by
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
there
was
fresh
astonishment
;
now
everyone
's
hair
was
standing
on
end
*NL*
with
awe
;
and
Don
Antonio
retiring
from
the
head
exclaimed
,
``
This
*NL*
suffices
to
show
me
that
I
have
not
been
deceived
by
him
who
sold
thee
to
*NL*
me
,
O
sage
head
,
talking
head
,
answering
head
,
wonderful
head
!
Let
some
*NL*
one
else
go
and
put
what
question
he
likes
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
women
are
commonly
impulsive
and
inquisitive
,
the
first
to
come
*NL*
forward
was
one
of
the
two
friends
of
Don
Antonio
's
wife
,
and
her
*NL*
question
was
,
``
Tell
me
,
Head
,
what
shall
I
do
to
be
very
beautiful
?
''
and
*NL*
the
answer
she
got
was
,
``
Be
very
modest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
question
thee
no
further
,
''
said
the
fair
querist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
companion
then
came
up
and
said
,
``
I
should
like
to
know
,
Head
,
*NL*
whether
my
husband
loves
me
or
not
;
''
the
answer
given
to
her
was
,
``
Think
*NL*
how
he
uses
thee
,
and
thou
mayest
guess
;
''
and
the
married
lady
went
off
*NL*
saying
,
``
That
answer
did
not
need
a
question
;
for
of
course
the
treatment
*NL*
one
receives
shows
the
disposition
of
him
from
whom
it
is
received
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
one
of
Don
Antonio
's
two
friends
advanced
and
asked
it
,
``
Who
am
I
?
''
*NL*
``
Thou
knowest
,
''
was
the
answer
.
``
That
is
not
what
I
ask
thee
,
''
said
the
*NL*
gentleman
,
``
but
to
tell
me
if
thou
knowest
me
.
''
``
Yes
,
I
know
thee
,
thou
*NL*
art
Don
Pedro
Noriz
,
''
was
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
seek
to
know
more
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
``
for
this
is
enough
to
*NL*
convince
me
,
O
Head
,
that
thou
knowest
everything
;
''
and
as
he
retired
the
*NL*
other
friend
came
forward
and
asked
it
,
``
Tell
me
,
Head
,
what
are
the
*NL*
wishes
of
my
eldest
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
said
already
,
''
was
the
answer
,
``
that
I
can
not
judge
of
wishes
;
*NL*
however
,
I
can
tell
thee
the
wish
of
thy
son
is
to
bury
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
`
what
I
see
with
my
eyes
I
point
out
with
my
finger
,
'
''
said
the
*NL*
gentleman
,
``
so
I
ask
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Antonio
's
wife
came
up
and
said
,
``
I
know
not
what
to
ask
thee
,
Head
;
*NL*
I
would
only
seek
to
know
of
thee
if
I
shall
have
many
years
of
enjoyment
*NL*
of
my
good
husband
;
''
and
the
answer
she
received
was
,
``
Thou
shalt
,
for
*NL*
his
vigour
and
his
temperate
habits
promise
many
years
of
life
,
which
by
*NL*
their
intemperance
others
so
often
cut
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Don
Quixote
came
forward
and
said
,
``
Tell
me
,
thou
that
answerest
,
*NL*
was
that
which
I
describe
as
having
happened
to
me
in
the
cave
of
*NL*
Montesinos
the
truth
or
a
dream
?
Will
Sancho
's
whipping
be
accomplished
*NL*
without
fail
?
Will
the
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
be
brought
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
question
of
the
cave
,
''
was
the
reply
,
``
there
is
much
to
be
*NL*
said
;
there
is
something
of
both
in
it
.
Sancho
's
whipping
will
proceed
*NL*
leisurely
.
The
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
will
attain
its
due
*NL*
consummation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
seek
to
know
no
more
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
let
me
but
see
Dulcinea
*NL*
disenchanted
,
and
I
will
consider
that
all
the
good
fortune
I
could
wish
*NL*
for
has
come
upon
me
all
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
questioner
was
Sancho
,
and
his
questions
were
,
``
Head
,
shall
I
by
*NL*
any
chance
have
another
government
?
Shall
I
ever
escape
from
the
hard
*NL*
life
of
a
squire
?
Shall
I
get
back
to
see
my
wife
and
children
?
''
To
which
*NL*
the
answer
came
,
``
Thou
shalt
govern
in
thy
house
;
and
if
thou
returnest
*NL*
to
it
thou
shalt
see
thy
wife
and
children
;
and
on
ceasing
to
serve
thou
*NL*
shalt
cease
to
be
a
squire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
by
God
!
''
said
Sancho
Panza
;
``
I
could
have
told
myself
that
;
the
*NL*
prophet
Perogrullo
could
have
said
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
answer
wouldst
thou
have
,
beast
?
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
is
it
not
*NL*
enough
that
the
replies
this
head
has
given
suit
the
questions
put
to
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
enough
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
I
should
have
liked
it
to
have
*NL*
made
itself
plainer
and
told
me
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
questions
and
answers
came
to
an
end
here
,
but
not
the
wonder
with
*NL*
which
all
were
filled
,
except
Don
Antonio
's
two
friends
who
were
in
the
*NL*
secret
.
This
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
thought
fit
to
reveal
at
once
,
not
to
*NL*
keep
the
world
in
suspense
,
fancying
that
the
head
had
some
strange
*NL*
magical
mystery
in
it
.
He
says
,
therefore
,
that
on
the
model
of
another
*NL*
head
,
the
work
of
an
image
maker
,
which
he
had
seen
at
Madrid
,
Don
*NL*
Antonio
made
this
one
at
home
for
his
own
amusement
and
to
astonish
*NL*
ignorant
people
;
and
its
mechanism
was
as
follows
.
The
table
was
of
wood
*NL*
painted
and
varnished
to
imitate
jasper
,
and
the
pedestal
on
which
it
*NL*
stood
was
of
the
same
material
,
with
four
eagles
'
claws
projecting
from
*NL*
it
to
support
the
weight
more
steadily
.
The
head
,
which
resembled
a
bust
*NL*
or
figure
of
a
Roman
emperor
,
and
was
coloured
like
bronze
,
was
hollow
*NL*
throughout
,
as
was
the
table
,
into
which
it
was
fitted
so
exactly
that
no
*NL*
trace
of
the
joining
was
visible
.
The
pedestal
of
the
table
was
also
*NL*
hollow
and
communicated
with
the
throat
and
neck
of
the
head
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
was
in
communication
with
another
room
underneath
the
chamber
in
*NL*
which
the
head
stood
.
Through
the
entire
cavity
in
the
pedestal
,
table
,
*NL*
throat
and
neck
of
the
bust
or
figure
,
there
passed
a
tube
of
tin
*NL*
carefully
adjusted
and
concealed
from
sight
.
In
the
room
below
*NL*
corresponding
to
the
one
above
was
placed
the
person
who
was
to
answer
,
*NL*
with
his
mouth
to
the
tube
,
and
the
voice
,
as
in
an
ear-trumpet
,
passed
*NL*
from
above
downwards
,
and
from
below
upwards
,
the
words
coming
clearly
*NL*
and
distinctly
;
it
was
impossible
,
thus
,
to
detect
the
trick
.
A
nephew
of
*NL*
Don
Antonio
's
,
a
smart
sharp-witted
student
,
was
the
answerer
,
and
as
he
*NL*
had
been
told
beforehand
by
his
uncle
who
the
persons
were
that
would
*NL*
come
with
him
that
day
into
the
chamber
where
the
head
was
,
it
was
an
*NL*
easy
matter
for
him
to
answer
the
first
question
at
once
and
correctly
;
*NL*
the
others
he
answered
by
guess-work
,
and
,
being
clever
,
cleverly
.
Cide
*NL*
Hamete
adds
that
this
marvellous
contrivance
stood
for
some
ten
or
twelve
*NL*
days
;
but
that
,
as
it
became
noised
abroad
through
the
city
that
he
had
*NL*
in
his
house
an
enchanted
head
that
answered
all
who
asked
questions
of
*NL*
it
,
Don
Antonio
,
fearing
it
might
come
to
the
ears
of
the
watchful
*NL*
sentinels
of
our
faith
,
explained
the
matter
to
the
inquisitors
,
who
*NL*
commanded
him
to
break
it
up
and
have
done
with
it
,
lest
the
ignorant
*NL*
vulgar
should
be
scandalised
.
By
Don
Quixote
,
however
,
and
by
Sancho
the
*NL*
head
was
still
held
to
be
an
enchanted
one
,
and
capable
of
answering
*NL*
questions
,
though
more
to
Don
Quixote
's
satisfaction
than
Sancho
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
of
the
city
,
to
gratify
Don
Antonio
and
also
to
do
the
*NL*
honours
to
Don
Quixote
,
and
give
him
an
opportunity
of
displaying
his
*NL*
folly
,
made
arrangements
for
a
tilting
at
the
ring
in
six
days
from
that
*NL*
time
,
which
,
however
,
for
reason
that
will
be
mentioned
hereafter
,
did
*NL*
not
take
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
took
a
fancy
to
stroll
about
the
city
quietly
and
on
foot
,
*NL*
for
he
feared
that
if
he
went
on
horseback
the
boys
would
follow
him
;
so
*NL*
he
and
Sancho
and
two
servants
that
Don
Antonio
gave
him
set
out
for
a
*NL*
walk
.
Thus
it
came
to
pass
that
going
along
one
of
the
streets
Don
*NL*
Quixote
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
written
in
very
large
letters
over
a
*NL*
door
,
``
Books
printed
here
,
''
at
which
he
was
vastly
pleased
,
for
until
*NL*
then
he
had
never
seen
a
printing
office
,
and
he
was
curious
to
know
what
*NL*
it
was
like
.
He
entered
with
all
his
following
,
and
saw
them
drawing
*NL*
sheets
in
one
place
,
correcting
in
another
,
setting
up
type
here
,
*NL*
revising
there
;
in
short
all
the
work
that
is
to
be
seen
in
great
*NL*
printing
offices
.
He
went
up
to
one
case
and
asked
what
they
were
about
*NL*
there
;
the
workmen
told
him
,
he
watched
them
with
wonder
,
and
passed
on
.
*NL*
He
approached
one
man
,
among
others
,
and
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
.
The
*NL*
workman
replied
,
``
Senor
,
this
gentleman
here
''
-LRB-
pointing
to
a
man
of
*NL*
prepossessing
appearance
and
a
certain
gravity
of
look
-RRB-
``
has
translated
*NL*
an
Italian
book
into
our
Spanish
tongue
,
and
I
am
setting
it
up
in
type
*NL*
for
the
press
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
title
of
the
book
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
;
to
which
the
author
*NL*
replied
,
``
Senor
,
in
Italian
the
book
is
called
Le
Bagatelle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
Le
Bagatelle
import
in
our
Spanish
?
''
asked
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Bagatelle
,
''
said
the
author
,
``
is
as
though
we
should
say
in
Spanish
*NL*
Los
Juguetes
;
but
though
the
book
is
humble
in
name
it
has
good
solid
*NL*
matter
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
have
some
little
smattering
of
Italian
,
and
I
*NL*
plume
myself
on
singing
some
of
Ariosto
's
stanzas
;
but
tell
me
,
senor
--
I
*NL*
do
not
say
this
to
test
your
ability
,
but
merely
out
of
curiosity
--
have
*NL*
you
ever
met
with
the
word
pignatta
in
your
book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
often
,
''
said
the
author
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
render
that
in
Spanish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
render
it
,
''
returned
the
author
,
``
but
by
olla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Body
o
'
me
,
''
exclaimed
Don
Quixote
,
``
what
a
proficient
you
are
in
the
*NL*
Italian
language
!
I
would
lay
a
good
wager
that
where
they
say
in
Italian
*NL*
piace
you
say
in
Spanish
place
,
and
where
they
say
piu
you
say
mas
,
and
*NL*
you
translate
su
by
arriba
and
giu
by
abajo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
translate
them
so
of
course
,
''
said
the
author
,
``
for
those
are
their
*NL*
proper
equivalents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
venture
to
swear
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
your
worship
is
not
*NL*
known
in
the
world
,
which
always
begrudges
their
reward
to
rare
wits
and
*NL*
praiseworthy
labours
.
What
talents
lie
wasted
there
!
What
genius
thrust
*NL*
away
into
corners
!
What
worth
left
neglected
!
Still
it
seems
to
me
that
*NL*
translation
from
one
language
into
another
,
if
it
be
not
from
the
queens
*NL*
of
languages
,
the
Greek
and
the
Latin
,
is
like
looking
at
Flemish
*NL*
tapestries
on
the
wrong
side
;
for
though
the
figures
are
visible
,
they
*NL*
are
full
of
threads
that
make
them
indistinct
,
and
they
do
not
show
with
*NL*
the
smoothness
and
brightness
of
the
right
side
;
and
translation
from
*NL*
easy
languages
argues
neither
ingenuity
nor
command
of
words
,
any
more
*NL*
than
transcribing
or
copying
out
one
document
from
another
.
But
I
do
not
*NL*
mean
by
this
to
draw
the
inference
that
no
credit
is
to
be
allowed
for
*NL*
the
work
of
translating
,
for
a
man
may
employ
himself
in
ways
worse
and
*NL*
less
profitable
to
himself
.
This
estimate
does
not
include
two
famous
*NL*
translators
,
Doctor
Cristobal
de
Figueroa
,
in
his
Pastor
Fido
,
and
Don
*NL*
Juan
de
Jauregui
,
in
his
Aminta
,
wherein
by
their
felicity
they
leave
it
*NL*
in
doubt
which
is
the
translation
and
which
the
original
.
But
tell
me
,
*NL*
are
you
printing
this
book
at
your
own
risk
,
or
have
you
sold
the
*NL*
copyright
to
some
bookseller
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
print
at
my
own
risk
,
''
said
the
author
,
``
and
I
expect
to
make
a
*NL*
thousand
ducats
at
least
by
this
first
edition
,
which
is
to
be
of
two
*NL*
thousand
copies
that
will
go
off
in
a

at
six
reals
apiece
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
calculation
you
are
making
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
it
is
plain
you
*NL*
do
n't
know
the
ins

outs

into
one

's
hands
.
I
promise
you
when
you
find
yourself
saddled
with
two
*NL*
thousand
copies
you
will
feel
so
sore
that
it
will
astonish
you
,
*NL*
particularly
if
the
book
is
a
little
out
of
the
common
and
not
in
any
way
*NL*
highly
spiced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
the
author
,
``
would
your
worship
,
then
,
have
me
give
it
to
a
*NL*
bookseller
who
will
give
three
maravedis
for
the
copyright
and
think
he
*NL*
is
doing
me
a
favour
?
I
do
not
print
my
books
to
win
fame
in
the
world
,
*NL*
for
I
am
known
in
it
already
by
my
works
;
I
want
to
make
money
,
without
*NL*
which
reputation
is
not
worth
a
rap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
send
your
worship
good
luck
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
and
he
moved
on
to
*NL*
another
case
,
where
he
saw
them
correcting
a
sheet
of
a
book
with
the
*NL*
title
of
``
Light
of
the
Soul
;
''
noticing
it
he
observed
,
``
Books
like
this
,
*NL*
though
there
are
many
of
the
kind
,
are
the
ones
that
deserve
to
be
*NL*
printed
,
for
many
are
the
sinners
in
these
days
,
and
lights
unnumbered
*NL*
are
needed
for
all
that
are
in
darkness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
on
,
and
saw
they
were
also
correcting
another
book
,
and
when
he
*NL*
asked
its
title
they
told
him
it
was
called
,
``
The
Second
Part
of
the
*NL*
Ingenious
Gentleman
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
''
by
one
of
Tordesillas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
of
this
book
already
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
verily
and
on
*NL*
my
conscience
I
thought
it
had
been
by
this
time
burned
to
ashes
as
a
*NL*
meddlesome
intruder
;
but
its
Martinmas
will
come
to
it
as
it
does
to
*NL*
every
pig
;
for
fictions
have
the
more
merit
and
charm
about
them
the
more
*NL*
nearly
they
approach
the
truth
or
what
looks
like
it
;
and
true
stories
,
*NL*
the
truer
they
are
the
better
they
are
;
''
and
so
saying
he
walked
out
of
*NL*
the
printing
office
with
a
certain
amount
of
displeasure
in
his
looks
.
*NL*
That
same
day
Don
Antonio
arranged
to
take
him
to
see
the
galleys
that
*NL*
lay
at
the
beach
,
whereat
Sancho
was
in
high
delight
,
as
he
had
never
*NL*
seen
any
all
his
life
.
Don
Antonio
sent
word
to
the
commandant
of
the
*NL*
galleys
that
he
intended
to
bring
his
guest
,
the
famous
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
of
whom
the
commandant
and
all
the
citizens
had
already
heard
,
*NL*
that
afternoon
to
see
them
;
and
what
happened
on
board
of
them
will
be
*NL*
told
in
the
next

*NL*
CHAPTER
LXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
MISHAP
THAT
BEFELL
SANCHO
PANZA
THROUGH
THE
VISIT
TO
THE
GALLEYS
,
*NL*
AND
THE
STRANGE
ADVENTURE
OF
THE
FAIR
MORISCO
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Profound
were
Don
Quixote
's
reflections
on
the
reply
of
the
enchanted
*NL*
head
,
not
one
of
them
,
however
,
hitting
on
the
secret
of
the
trick
,
but
*NL*
all
concentrated
on
the
promise
,
which
he
regarded
as
a
certainty
,
of
*NL*
Dulcinea
's
disenchantment
.
This
he
turned
over
in
his
mind
again
and
*NL*
again
with
great
satisfaction
,
fully
persuaded
that
he
would
shortly
see
*NL*
its
fulfillment
;
and
as
for
Sancho
,
though
,
as
has
been
said
,
he
hated
*NL*
being
a
governor
,
still
he
had
a
longing
to
be
giving
orders
and
finding
*NL*
himself
obeyed
once
more
;
this
is
the
misfortune
that
being
in
authority
,
*NL*
even
in
jest
,
brings
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
resume
;
that
afternoon
their
host
Don
Antonio
Moreno
and
his
two
*NL*
friends
,
with
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
,
went
to
the
galleys
.
The
commandant
*NL*
had
been
already
made
aware
of
his
good
fortune
in
seeing
two
such
famous
*NL*
persons
as
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
,
and
the
instant
they
came
to
the
shore
*NL*
all
the
galleys
struck
their
awnings
and
the
clarions
rang
out
.
A
skiff
*NL*
covered
with
rich
carpets
and
cushions
of
crimson
velvet
was
immediately
*NL*
lowered
into
the
water
,
and
as
Don
Quixote
stepped
on
board
of
it
,
the
*NL*
leading
galley
fired
her
gangway
gun
,
and
the
other
galleys
did
the
same
;
*NL*
and
as
he
mounted
the
starboard
ladder
the
whole
crew
saluted
him
-LRB-
as
is
*NL*
the
custom
when
a
personage
of
distinction
comes
on
board
a
galley
-RRB-
by
*NL*
exclaiming
``
Hu
,
hu
,
hu
,
''
three
times
.
The
general
,
for
so
we
shall
call
*NL*
him
,
a
Valencian
gentleman
of
rank
,
gave
him
his
hand
and
embraced
him
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
I
shall
mark
this
day
with
a
white
stone
as
one
of
the
happiest
*NL*
I
can
expect
to
enjoy
in
my
lifetime
,
since
I
have
seen
Senor
Don
Quixote
*NL*
of
La
Mancha
,
pattern
and
image
wherein
we
see
contained
and
condensed
*NL*
all
that
is
worthy
in
knight-errantry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
delighted
beyond
measure
with
such
a
lordly
reception
,
*NL*
replied
to
him
in
words
no
less
courteous
.
All
then
proceeded
to
the
*NL*
poop
,
which
was
very
handsomely
decorated
,
and
seated
themselves
on
the
*NL*
bulwark
benches
;
the
boatswain
passed
along
the
gangway
and
piped
all
*NL*
hands
to
strip
,
which
they
did
in
an
instant
.
Sancho
,
seeing
such
a
*NL*
number
of
men
stripped
to
the
skin
,
was
taken
aback
,
and
still
more
when
*NL*
he
saw
them
spread
the
awning
so
briskly
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
all
*NL*
the
devils
were
at
work
at
it
;
but
all
this
was
cakes
and
fancy
bread
to
*NL*
what
I
am
going
to
tell
now
.
Sancho
was
seated
on
the
captain
's
stage
,
*NL*
close
to
the
aftermost
rower
on
the
right-hand
side
.
He
,
previously
*NL*
instructed
in
what
he
was
to
do
,
laid
hold
of
Sancho
,
hoisting
him
up
in
*NL*
his
arms
,
and
the
whole
crew
,
who
were
standing
ready
,
beginning
on
the
*NL*
right
,
proceeded
to
pass
him
on
,
whirling
him
along
from
hand
to
hand
and
*NL*
from
bench
to
bench
with
such
rapidity
that
it
took
the
sight
out
of
poor
*NL*
Sancho
's
eyes
,
and
he
made
quite
sure
that
the
devils
themselves
were
*NL*
flying
away
with
him
;
nor
did
they
leave
off
with
him
until
they
had
sent
*NL*
him
back
along
the
left
side
and
deposited
him
on
the
poop
;
and
the
poor
*NL*
fellow
was
left
bruised
and
breathless
and
all
in
a
sweat
,
and
unable
to
*NL*
comprehend
what
it
was
that
had
happened
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
when
he
saw
Sancho
's
flight
without
wings
asked
the
general
*NL*
if
this
was
a
usual
ceremony
with
those
who
came
on
board
the
galleys
for
*NL*
the
first
time
;
for
,
if
so
,
as
he
had
no
intention
of
adopting
them
as
a
*NL*
profession
,
he
had
no
mind
to
perform
such
feats
of
agility
,
and
if
*NL*
anyone
offered
to
lay
hold
of
him
to
whirl
him
about
,
he
vowed
to
God
he
*NL*
would
kick
his
soul
out
;
and
as
he
said
this
he
stood
up
and
clapped
his
*NL*
hand
upon
his
sword
.
At
this
instant
they
struck
the
awning
and
lowered
*NL*
the
yard
with
a
prodigious
rattle
.
Sancho
thought
heaven
was
coming
off
*NL*
its
hinges
and
going
to
fall
on
his
head
,
and
full
of
terror
he
ducked
it
*NL*
and
buried
it
between
his
knees
;
nor
were
Don
Quixote
's
knees
altogether
*NL*
under
control
,
for
he
too
shook
a
little
,
squeezed
his
shoulders
together
*NL*
and
lost
colour
.
The
crew
then
hoisted
the
yard
with
the
same
rapidity
*NL*
and
clatter
as
when
they
lowered
it
,
all
the
while
keeping
silence
as
*NL*
though
they
had
neither
voice
nor
breath
.
The
boatswain
gave
the
signal
*NL*
to
weigh
anchor
,
and
leaping
upon
the
middle
of
the
gangway
began
to
lay
*NL*
on
to
the
shoulders
of
the
crew
with
his
courbash
or
whip
,
and
to
haul
*NL*
out
gradually
to
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sancho
saw
so
many
red
feet
-LRB-
for
such
he
took
the
oars
to
be
-RRB-
moving
*NL*
all
together
,
he
said
to
himself
,
``
It
's
these
that
are
the
real
chanted
*NL*
things
,
and
not
the
ones
my
master
talks
of
.
What
can
those
wretches
have
*NL*
done
to
be
so
whipped
;
and
how
does
that
one
man
who
goes
along
there
*NL*
whistling
dare
to
whip
so
many
?
I
declare
this
is
hell
,
or
at
least
*NL*
purgatory
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
observing
how
attentively
Sancho
regarded
what
was
going
on
,
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
Ah
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
how
quickly
and
cheaply
might
you
*NL*
finish
off
the
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
,
if
you
would
strip
to
the
*NL*
waist
and
take
your
place
among
those
gentlemen
!
Amid
the
pain
and
*NL*
sufferings
of
so
many
you
would
not
feel
your
own
much
;
and
moreover
*NL*
perhaps
the
sage
Merlin
would
allow
each
of
these
lashes
,
being
laid
on
*NL*
with
a
good
hand
,
to
count
for
ten
of
those
which
you
must
give
yourself
*NL*
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
was
about
to
ask
what
these
lashes
were
,
and
what
was
*NL*
Dulcinea
's
disenchantment
,
when
a
sailor
exclaimed
,
``
Monjui
signals
that
*NL*
there
is
an
oared
vessel
off
the
coast
to
the
west
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
the
general
sprang
upon
the
gangway
crying
,
``
Now
then
,
my
*NL*
sons
,
do
n't
let
her
give
us
the
slip
!
It
must
be
some
Algerine
corsair
*NL*
brigantine
that
the
watchtower
signals
to
us
.
''
The
three
others
*NL*
immediately
came
alongside
the
chief
galley
to
receive
their
orders
.
The
*NL*
general
ordered
two
to
put
out
to
sea
while
he
with
the
other
kept
in
*NL*
shore
,
so
that
in
this
way
the
vessel
could
not
escape
them
.
The
crews
*NL*
plied
the
oars
driving
the
galleys
so
furiously
that
they
seemed
to
fly
.
*NL*
The
two
that
had
put
out
to
sea
,
after
a
couple
of
miles
sighted
a
vessel
*NL*
which
,
so
far
as
they
could
make
out
,
they
judged
to
be
one
of
fourteen
*NL*
or
fifteen
banks
,
and
so
she
proved
.
As
soon
as
the
vessel
discovered
the
*NL*
galleys
she
went
about
with
the
object
and
in
the
hope
of
making
her
*NL*
escape
by
her
speed
;
but
the
attempt
failed
,
for
the
chief
galley
was
one
*NL*
of
the
fastest
vessels
afloat
,
and
overhauled
her
so
rapidly
that
they
on
*NL*
board
the
brigantine
saw
clearly
there
was
no
possibility
of
escaping
,
*NL*
and
the
rais
therefore
would
have
had
them
drop
their
oars
and
give
*NL*
themselves
up
so
as
not
to
provoke
the
captain
in
command
of
our
galleys
*NL*
to
anger
.
But
chance
,
directing
things
otherwise
,
so
ordered
it
that
just
*NL*
as
the
chief
galley
came
close
enough
for
those
on
board
the
vessel
to
*NL*
hear
the
shouts
from
her
calling
on
them
to
surrender
,
two
Toraquis
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
two
Turks
,
both
drunken
,
that
with
a
dozen
more
were
on
board
*NL*
the
brigantine
,
discharged
their
muskets
,
killing
two
of
the
soldiers
*NL*
that
lined
the
sides
of
our
vessel
.
Seeing
this
the
general
swore
he
*NL*
would
not
leave
one
of
those
he
found
on
board
the
vessel
alive
,
but
as
*NL*
he
bore
down
furiously
upon
her
she
slipped
away
from
him
underneath
the
*NL*
oars
.
The
galley
shot
a
good
way
ahead
;
those
on
board
the
vessel
saw
*NL*
their
case
was
desperate
,
and
while
the
galley
was
coming
about
they
made
*NL*
sail
,
and
by
sailing
and
rowing
once
more
tried
to
sheer
off
;
but
their
*NL*
activity
did
not
do
them
as
much
good
as
their
rashness
did
them
harm
,
*NL*
for
the
galley
coming
up
with
them
in
a
little
more
than
half
a
mile
*NL*
threw
her
oars
over
them
and
took
the
whole
of
them
alive
.
The
other
two
*NL*
galleys
now
joined
company
and
all
four
returned
with
the
prize
to
the
*NL*
beach
,
where
a
vast
multitude
stood
waiting
for
them
,
eager
to
see
what
*NL*
they
brought
back
.
The
general
anchored
close
in
,
and
perceived
that
the
*NL*
viceroy
of
the
city
was
on
the
shore
.
He
ordered
the
skiff
to
push
off
to
*NL*
fetch
him
,
and
the
yard
to
be
lowered
for
the
purpose
of
hanging
*NL*
forthwith
the
rais
and
the
rest
of
the
men
taken
on
board
the
vessel
,
*NL*
about
six-and-thirty
in
number
,
all
smart
fellows
and
most
of
them
*NL*
Turkish
musketeers
.
He
asked
which
was
the
rais
of
the
brigantine
,
and
*NL*
was
answered
in
Spanish
by
one
of
the
prisoners
-LRB-
who
afterwards
proved
to
*NL*
be
a
Spanish
renegade
-RRB-
,
``
This
young
man
,
senor
that
you
see
here
is
our
*NL*
rais
,
''
and
he
pointed
to
one
of
the
handsomest
and
most
gallant-looking
*NL*
youths
that
could
be
imagined
.
He
did
not
seem
to
be
twenty
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
dog
,
''
said
the
general
,
``
what
led
thee
to
kill
my
soldiers
,
*NL*
when
thou
sawest
it
was
impossible
for
thee
to
escape
?
Is
that
the
way
to
*NL*
behave
to
chief
galleys
?
Knowest
thou
not
that
rashness
is
not
valour
?
*NL*
Faint
prospects
of
success
should
make
men
bold
,
but
not
rash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rais
was
about
to
reply
,
but
the
general
could
not
at
that
moment
*NL*
listen
to
him
,
as
he
had
to
hasten
to
receive
the
viceroy
,
who
was
now
*NL*
coming
on
board
the
galley
,
and
with
him
certain
of
his
attendants
and
*NL*
some
of
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
had
a
good
chase
,
senor
general
,
''
said
the
viceroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
shall
soon
see
how
good
,
by
the
game
strung
up
to
this
*NL*
yard
,
''
replied
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
returned
the
viceroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
the
general
,
``
against
all
law
,
reason
,
and
usages
of
war
*NL*
they
have
killed
on
my
hands
two
of
the
best
soldiers
on
board
these
*NL*
galleys
,
and
I
have
sworn
to
hang
every
man
that
I
have
taken
,
but
above
*NL*
all
this
youth
who
is
the
rais
of
the
brigantine
,
''
and
he
pointed
to
him
*NL*
as
he
stood
with
his
hands
already
bound
and
the
rope
round
his
neck
,
*NL*
ready
for
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
viceroy
looked
at
him
,
and
seeing
him
so
well-favoured
,
so
graceful
,
*NL*
and
so
submissive
,
he
felt
a
desire
to
spare
his
life
,
the
comeliness
of
*NL*
the
youth
furnishing
him
at
once
with
a
letter
of
recommendation
.
He
*NL*
therefore
questioned
him
,
saying
,
``
Tell
me
,
rais
,
art
thou
Turk
,
Moor
,
or
*NL*
renegade
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
youth
replied
,
also
in
Spanish
,
``
I
am
neither
Turk
,
nor
*NL*
Moor
,
nor
renegade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
thou
,
then
?
''
said
the
viceroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Christian
woman
,
''
replied
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
and
a
Christian
,
in
such
a
dress
and
in
such
circumstances
!
It
*NL*
is
more
marvellous
than
credible
,
''
said
the
viceroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suspend
the
execution
of
the
sentence
,
''
said
the
youth
;
``
your
vengeance
*NL*
will
not
lose
much
by
waiting
while
I
tell
you
the
story
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
heart
could
be
so
hard
as
not
to
be
softened
by
these
words
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
so
far
as
to
listen
to
what
the
unhappy
youth
had
to
say
?
The
*NL*
general
bade
him
say
what
he
pleased
,
but
not
to
expect
pardon
for
his
*NL*
flagrant
offence
.
With
this
permission
the
youth
began
in
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Born
of
Morisco
parents
,
I
am
of
that
nation
,
more
unhappy
than
wise
,
*NL*
upon
which
of
late
a
sea
of
woes
has
poured
down
.
In
the
course
of
our
*NL*
misfortune
I
was
carried
to
Barbary
by
two
uncles
of
mine
,
for
it
was
in
*NL*
vain
that
I
declared
I
was
a
Christian
,
as
in
fact
I
am
,
and
not
a
mere
*NL*
pretended
one
,
or
outwardly
,
but
a
true
Catholic
Christian
.
It
availed
me
*NL*
nothing
with
those
charged
with
our
sad
expatriation
to
protest
this
,
nor
*NL*
would
my
uncles
believe
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
they
treated
it
as
an
*NL*
untruth
and
a
subterfuge
set
up
to
enable
me
to
remain
behind
in
the
land
*NL*
of
my
birth
;
and
so
,
more
by
force
than
of
my
own
will
,
they
took
me
with
*NL*
them
.
I
had
a
Christian
mother
,
and
a
father
who
was
a
man
of
sound
sense
*NL*
and
a
Christian
too
;
I
imbibed
the
Catholic
faith
with
my
mother
's
milk
,
*NL*
I
was
well
brought
up
,
and
neither
in
word
nor
in
deed
did
I
,
I
think
,
*NL*
show
any
sign
of
being
a
Morisco
.
To
accompany
these
virtues
,
for
such
I
*NL*
hold
them
,
my
beauty
,
if
I
possess
any
,
grew
with
my
growth
;
and
great
as
*NL*
was
the
seclusion
in
which
I
lived
it
was
not
so
great
but
that
a
young
*NL*
gentleman
,
Don
Gaspar
Gregorio
by
name
,
eldest
son
of
a
gentleman
who
is
*NL*
lord
of
a
village
near
ours
,
contrived
to
find
opportunities
of
seeing
*NL*
me
.
How
he
saw
me
,
how
we
met
,
how
his
heart
was
lost
to
me
,
and
mine
not
*NL*
kept
from
him
,
would
take
too
long
to
tell
,
especially
at
a
moment
when
I
*NL*
am
in
dread
of
the
cruel
cord
that
threatens
me
interposing
between
*NL*
tongue
and
throat
;
I
will
only
say
,
therefore
,
that
Don
Gregorio
chose
to
*NL*
accompany
me
in
our
banishment
.
He
joined
company
with
the
Moriscoes
who
*NL*
were
going
forth
from
other
villages
,
for
he
knew
their
language
very
*NL*
well
,
and
on
the
voyage
he
struck
up
a
friendship
with
my
two
uncles
who
*NL*
were
carrying
me
with
them
;
for
my
father
,
like
a
wise
and
far-sighted
*NL*
man
,
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
first
edict
for
our
expulsion
,
quitted
the
*NL*
village
and
departed
in
quest
of
some
refuge
for
us
abroad
.
He
left
*NL*
hidden
and
buried
,
at
a
spot
of
which
I
alone
have
knowledge
,
a
large
*NL*
quantity
of
pearls
and
precious
stones
of
great
value
,
together
with
a
*NL*
sum
of
money
in
gold
cruzadoes
and
doubloons
.
He
charged
me
on
no
account
*NL*
to
touch
the
treasure
,
if
by
any
chance
they
expelled
us
before
his
*NL*
return
.
I
obeyed
him
,
and
with
my
uncles
,
as
I
have
said
,
and
others
of
*NL*
our
kindred
and
neighbours
,
passed
over
to
Barbary
,
and
the
place
where
*NL*
we
took
up
our
abode
was
Algiers
,
much
the
same
as
if
we
had
taken
it
up
*NL*
in
hell
itself
.
The
king
heard
of
my
beauty
,
and
report
told
him
of
my
*NL*
wealth
,
which
was
in
some
degree
fortunate
for
me
.
He
summoned
me
before
*NL*
him
,
and
asked
me
what
part
of
Spain
I
came
from
,
and
what
money
and
*NL*
jewels
I
had
.
I
mentioned
the
place
,
and
told
him
the
jewels
and
money
*NL*
were
buried
there
;
but
that
they
might
easily
be
recovered
if
I
myself
*NL*
went
back
for
them
.
All
this
I
told
him
,
in
dread
lest
my
beauty
and
not
*NL*
his
own
covetousness
should
influence
him
.
While
he
was
engaged
in
*NL*
conversation
with
me
,
they
brought
him
word
that
in
company
with
me
was
*NL*
one
of
the
handsomest
and
most
graceful
youths
that
could
be
imagined
.
I
*NL*
knew
at
once
that
they
were
speaking
of
Don
Gaspar
Gregorio
,
whose
*NL*
comeliness
surpasses
the
most
highly
vaunted
beauty
.
I
was
troubled
when
*NL*
I
thought
of
the
danger
he
was
in
,
for
among
those
barbarous
Turks
a
fair
*NL*
youth
is
more
esteemed
than
a
woman
,
be
she
ever
so
beautiful
.
The
king
*NL*
immediately
ordered
him
to
be
brought
before
him
that
he
might
see
him
,
*NL*
and
asked
me
if
what
they
said
about
the
youth
was
true
.
I
then
,
almost
*NL*
as
if
inspired
by
heaven
,
told
him
it
was
,
but
that
I
would
have
him
to
*NL*
know
it
was
not
a
man
,
but
a
woman
like
myself
,
and
I
entreated
him
to
*NL*
allow
me
to
go
and
dress
her
in
the
attire
proper
to
her
,
so
that
her
*NL*
beauty
might
be
seen
to
perfection
,
and
that
she
might
present
herself
*NL*
before
him
with
less
embarrassment
.
He
bade
me
go
by
all
means
,
and
said
*NL*
that
the
next
day
we
should
discuss
the
plan
to
be
adopted
for
my
return
*NL*
to
Spain
to
carry
away
the
hidden
treasure
.
I
saw
Don
Gaspar
,
I
told
him
*NL*
the
danger
he
was
in
if
he
let
it
be
seen
he
was
a
man
,
I
dressed
him
as
*NL*
a
Moorish
woman
,
and
that
same
afternoon
I
brought
him
before
the
king
,
*NL*
who
was
charmed
when
he
saw
him
,
and
resolved
to
keep
the
damsel
and
make
*NL*
a
present
of
her
to
the
Grand
Signor
;
and
to
avoid
the
risk
she
might
run
*NL*
among
the
women
of
his
seraglio
,
and
distrustful
of
himself
,
he
commanded
*NL*
her
to
be
placed
in
the
house
of
some
Moorish
ladies
of
rank
who
would
*NL*
protect
and
attend
to
her
;
and
thither
he
was
taken
at
once
.
What
we
both
*NL*
suffered
-LRB-
for
I
can
not
deny
that
I
love
him
-RRB-
may
be
left
to
the
*NL*
imagination
of
those
who
are
separated
if
they
love
one
another
dearly
.
*NL*
The
king
then
arranged
that
I
should
return
to
Spain
in
this
brigantine
,
*NL*
and
that
two
Turks
,
those
who
killed
your
soldiers
,
should
accompany
me
.
*NL*
There
also
came
with
me
this
Spanish
renegade
''
--
and
here
she
pointed
to
*NL*
him
who
had
first
spoken
--
``
whom
I
know
to
be
secretly
a
Christian
,
and
to
*NL*
be
more
desirous
of
being
left
in
Spain
than
of
returning
to
Barbary
.
The
*NL*
rest
of
the
crew
of
the
brigantine
are
Moors
and
Turks
,
who
merely
serve
*NL*
as
rowers
.
The
two
Turks
,
greedy
and
insolent
,
instead
of
obeying
the
*NL*
orders
we
had
to
land
me
and
this
renegade
in
Christian
dress
-LRB-
with
which
*NL*
we
came
provided
-RRB-
on
the
first
Spanish
ground
we
came
to
,
chose
to
run
*NL*
along
the
coast
and
make
some
prize
if
they
could
,
fearing
that
if
they
*NL*
put
us
ashore
first
,
we
might
,
in
case
of
some
accident
befalling
us
,
*NL*
make
it
known
that
the
brigantine
was
at
sea
,
and
thus
,
if
there
happened
*NL*
to
be
any
galleys
on
the
coast
,
they
might
be
taken
.
We
sighted
this
*NL*
shore
last
night
,
and
knowing
nothing
of
these
galleys
,
we
were
*NL*
discovered
,
and
the
result
was
what
you
have
seen
.
To
sum
up
,
there
is
*NL*
Don
Gregorio
in
woman
's
dress
,
among
women
,
in
imminent
danger
of
his
*NL*
life
;
and
here
am
I
,
with
hands
bound
,
in
expectation
,
or
rather
in
*NL*
dread
,
of
losing
my
life
,
of
which
I
am
already
weary
.
Here
,
sirs
,
ends
*NL*
my
sad
story
,
as
true
as
it
is
unhappy
;
all
I
ask
of
you
is
to
allow
me
*NL*
to
die
like
a
Christian
,
for
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
I
am
not
to
be
*NL*
charged
with
the
offence
of
which
those
of
my
nation
are
guilty
;
''
and
she
*NL*
stood
silent
,
her
eyes
filled
with
moving
tears
,
accompanied
by
plenty
*NL*
from
the
bystanders
.
The
viceroy
,
touched
with
compassion
,
went
up
to
her
*NL*
without
speaking
and
untied
the
cord
that
bound
the
hands
of
the
Moorish
*NL*
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
the
while
the
Morisco
Christian
was
telling
her
strange
story
,
an
*NL*
elderly
pilgrim
,
who
had
come
on
board
of
the
galley
at
the
same
time
as
*NL*
the
viceroy
,
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
;
and
the
instant
she
ceased
*NL*
speaking
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
,
and
embracing
them
said
in
a
voice
*NL*
broken
by
sobs
and
sighs
,
``
O
Ana
Felix
,
my
unhappy
daughter
,
I
am
thy
*NL*
father
Ricote
,
come
back
to
look
for
thee
,
unable
to
live
without
thee
,
*NL*
my
soul
that
thou
art
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
of
his
,
Sancho
opened
his
eyes
and
raised
his
head
,
which
*NL*
he
had
been
holding
down
,
brooding
over
his
unlucky
excursion
;
and
*NL*
looking
at
the
pilgrim
he
recognised
in
him
that
same
Ricote
he
met
the
*NL*
day
he
quitted
his
government
,
and
felt
satisfied
that
this
was
his
*NL*
daughter
.
She
being
now
unbound
embraced
her
father
,
mingling
her
tears
*NL*
with
his
,
while
he
addressing
the
general
and
the
viceroy
said
,
``
This
,
*NL*
sirs
,
is
my
daughter
,
more
unhappy
in
her
adventures
than
in
her
name
.
*NL*
She
is
Ana
Felix
,
surnamed
Ricote
,
celebrated
as
much
for
her
own
beauty
*NL*
as
for
my
wealth
.
I
quitted
my
native
land
in
search
of
some
shelter
or
*NL*
refuge
for
us
abroad
,
and
having
found
one
in
Germany
I
returned
in
this
*NL*
pilgrim
's
dress
,
in
the
company
of
some
other
German
pilgrims
,
to
seek
my
*NL*
daughter
and
take
up
a
large
quantity
of
treasure
I
had
left
buried
.
My
*NL*
daughter
I
did
not
find
,
the
treasure
I
found
and
have
with
me
;
and
now
,
*NL*
in
this
strange
roundabout
way
you
have
seen
,
I
find
the
treasure
that
*NL*
more
than
all
makes
me
rich
,
my
beloved
daughter
.
If
our
innocence
and
*NL*
her
tears
and
mine
can
with
strict
justice
open
the
door
to
clemency
,
*NL*
extend
it
to
us
,
for
we
never
had
any
intention
of
injuring
you
,
nor
do
*NL*
we
sympathise
with
the
aims
of
our
people
,
who
have
been
justly
*NL*
banished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
Ricote
well
,
''
said
Sancho
at
this
,
``
and
I
know
too
that
what
he
*NL*
says
about
Ana
Felix
being
his
daughter
is
true
;
but
as
to
those
other
*NL*
particulars
about
going
and
coming
,
and
having
good
or
bad
intentions
,
I
*NL*
say
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
all
present
stood
amazed
at
this
strange
occurrence
the
general
*NL*
said
,
``
At
any
rate
your
tears
will
not
allow
me
to
keep
my
oath
;
live
,
*NL*
fair
Ana
Felix
,
all
the
years
that
heaven
has
allotted
you
;
but
these
*NL*
rash
insolent
fellows
must
pay
the
penalty
of
the
crime
they
have
*NL*
committed
;
''
and
with
that
he
gave
orders
to
have
the
two
Turks
who
had
*NL*
killed
his
two
soldiers
hanged
at
once
at
the
yard-arm
.
The
viceroy
,
*NL*
however
,
begged
him
earnestly
not
to
hang
them
,
as
their
behaviour
*NL*
savoured
rather
of
madness
than
of
bravado
.
The
general
yielded
to
the
*NL*
viceroy
's
request
,
for
revenge
is
not
easily
taken
in
cold
blood
.
They
*NL*
then
tried
to
devise
some
scheme
for
rescuing
Don
Gaspar
Gregorio
from
*NL*
the
danger
in
which
he
had
been
left
.
Ricote
offered
for
that
object
more
*NL*
than
two
thousand
ducats
that
he
had
in
pearls
and
gems
;
they
proposed
*NL*
several
plans
,
but
none
so
good
as
that
suggested
by
the
renegade
already
*NL*
mentioned
,
who
offered
to
return
to
Algiers
in
a
small
vessel
of
about
*NL*
six
banks
,
manned
by
Christian
rowers
,
as
he
knew
where
,
how
,
and
when
he
*NL*
could
and
should
land
,
nor
was
he
ignorant
of
the
house
in
which
Don
*NL*
Gaspar
was
staying
.
The
general
and
the
viceroy
had
some
hesitation
about
*NL*
placing
confidence
in
the
renegade
and
entrusting
him
with
the
Christians
*NL*
who
were
to
row
,
but
Ana
Felix
said
she
could
answer
for
him
,
and
her
*NL*
father
offered
to
go
and
pay
the
ransom
of
the
Christians
if
by
any
*NL*
chance
they
should
not
be
forthcoming
.
This
,
then
,
being
agreed
upon
,
the
*NL*
viceroy
landed
,
and
Don
Antonio
Moreno
took
the
fair
Morisco
and
her
*NL*
father
home
with
him
,
the
viceroy
charging
him
to
give
them
the
best
*NL*
reception
and
welcome
in
his
power
,
while
on
his
own
part
he
offered
all
*NL*
that
house
contained
for
their
entertainment
;
so
great
was
the
good-will
*NL*
and
kindliness
the
beauty
of
Ana
Felix
had
infused
into
his
heart

TREATING
OF
THE
ADVENTURE
WHICH
GAVE
DON
QUIXOTE
MORE
UNHAPPINESS
THAN
*NL*
ALL
THAT
HAD
HITHERTO
BEFALLEN
HIM
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
wife
of
Don
Antonio
Moreno
,
so
the
history
says
,
was
extremely
happy
*NL*
to
see
Ana
Felix
in
her
house
.
She
welcomed
her
with
great
kindness
,
*NL*
charmed
as
well
by
her
beauty
as
by
her
intelligence
;
for
in
both
*NL*
respects
the
fair
Morisco
was
richly
endowed
,
and
all
the
people
of
the
*NL*
city
flocked
to
see
her
as
though
they
had
been
summoned
by
the
ringing
*NL*
of
the
bells
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
told
Don
Antonio
that
the
plan
adopted
for
releasing
Don
*NL*
Gregorio
was
not
a
good
one
,
for
its
risks
were
greater
than
its
*NL*
advantages
,
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
land
himself
with
his
arms
and
*NL*
horse
in
Barbary
;
for
he
would
carry
him
off
in
spite
of
the
whole
*NL*
Moorish
host
,
as
Don
Gaiferos
carried
off
his
wife
Melisendra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
your
worship
,
''
observed
Sancho
on
hearing
him
say
so
,
``
Senor
*NL*
Don
Gaiferos
carried
off
his
wife
from
the
mainland
,
and
took
her
to
*NL*
France
by
land
;
but
in
this
case
,
if
by
chance
we
carry
off
Don
Gregorio
,
*NL*
we
have
no
way
of
bringing
him
to
Spain
,
for
there
's
the
sea
between
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
remedy
for
everything
except
death
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
if
*NL*
they
bring
the
vessel
close
to
the
shore
we
shall
be
able
to
get
on
board
*NL*
though
all
the
world
strive
to
prevent
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
hits
it
off
mighty
well
and
mighty
easy
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
but
*NL*
`
it
's
a
long
step
from
saying
to
doing
;
'
and
I
hold
to
the
renegade
,
for
*NL*
he
seems
to
me
an
honest
good-hearted
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Antonio
then
said
that
if
the
renegade
did
not
prove
successful
,
the
*NL*
expedient
of
the
great
Don
Quixote
's
expedition
to
Barbary
should
be
*NL*
adopted
.
Two
days
afterwards
the
renegade
put
to
sea
in
a
light
vessel
of
*NL*
six
oars
a-side
manned
by
a
stout
crew
,
and
two
days
later
the
galleys
*NL*
made
sail
eastward
,
the
general
having
begged
the
viceroy
to
let
him
know
*NL*
all
about
the
release
of
Don
Gregorio
and
about
Ana
Felix
,
and
the
*NL*
viceroy
promised
to
do
as
he
requested
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
as
Don
Quixote
went
out
for
a
stroll
along
the
beach
,
arrayed
*NL*
in
full
armour
-LRB-
for
,
as
he
often
said
,
that
was
``
his
only
gear
,
his
only
*NL*
rest
the
fray
,
''
and
he
never
was
without
it
for
a
moment
-RRB-
,
he
saw
coming
*NL*
towards
him
a
knight
,
also
in
full
armour
,
with
a
shining
moon
painted
on
*NL*
his
shield
,
who
,
on
approaching
sufficiently
near
to
be
heard
,
said
in
a
*NL*
loud
voice
,
addressing
himself
to
Don
Quixote
,
``
Illustrious
knight
,
and
*NL*
never
sufficiently
extolled
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
I
am
the
Knight
of
*NL*
the
White
Moon
,
whose
unheard-of
achievements
will
perhaps
have
recalled
*NL*
him
to
thy
memory
.
I
come
to
do
battle
with
thee
and
prove
the
might
of
*NL*
thy
arm
,
to
the
end
that
I
make
thee
acknowledge
and
confess
that
my
*NL*
lady
,
let
her
be
who
she
may
,
is
incomparably
fairer
than
thy
Dulcinea
*NL*
del
Toboso
.
If
thou
dost
acknowledge
this
fairly
and
openly
,
thou
shalt
*NL*
escape
death
and
save
me
the
trouble
of
inflicting
it
upon
thee
;
if
thou
*NL*
fightest
and
I
vanquish
thee
,
I
demand
no
other
satisfaction
than
that

laying
aside
arms

abstaining
from
going
in
quest
of
adventures
,
thou
*NL*
withdraw
and
betake
thyself
to
thine
own
village
for
the
space
of
a

and
live
there
without
putting
hand
to
sword
,
in
peace

quiet
and
*NL*
beneficial
repose
,
the

being
needful
for
the
increase
of
thy
*NL*
substance

the
salvation
of
thy
soul

if
thou
dost
vanquish
me

my

head
shall
be
at
thy
disposal

my
arms

horse
thy
spoils

and
the
*NL*
renown
of
my
deeds
transferred
and
added
to
thine
.
Consider
which
will
be
*NL*
thy
best
course
,
and
give
me
thy
answer
speedily

for
this
day
is
all
the
*NL*
time
I
have
for
the
despatch
of
this
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
amazed
and
astonished
,
as
well
at
the
Knight
of
the
White
*NL*
Moon
's
arrogance
,
as
at
his
reason
for
delivering
the
defiance
,
and
with
*NL*
calm
dignity
he
answered
him
,
``
Knight
of
the
White
Moon
,
of
whose
*NL*
achievements
I
have
never
heard
until
now
,
I
will
venture
to
swear
you
*NL*
have
never
seen
the
illustrious
Dulcinea
;
for
had
you
seen
her
I
know
you
*NL*
would
have
taken
care
not
to
venture
yourself
upon
this
issue
,
because
*NL*
the
sight
would
have
removed
all
doubt
from
your
mind
that
there
ever
has
*NL*
been
or
can
be
a
beauty
to
be
compared
with
hers
;
and
so
,
not
saying
you
*NL*
lie
,
but
merely
that
you
are
not
correct
in
what
you
state
,
I
accept
your
*NL*
challenge
,
with
the
conditions
you
have
proposed
,
and
at
once
,
that
the
*NL*
day
you
have
fixed
may
not
expire
;
and
from
your
conditions
I
except
only
*NL*
that
of
the
renown
of
your
achievements
being
transferred
to
me
,
for
I
*NL*
know
not
of
what
sort
they
are
nor
what
they
may
amount
to
;
I
am
*NL*
satisfied
with
my
own
,
such
as
they
be
.
Take
,
therefore
,
the
side
of
the
*NL*
field
you
choose
,
and
I
will
do
the

;

to
whom
God
shall
give
it
*NL*
may
Saint
Peter
add
his
blessing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
of
the
White
Moon
had
been
seen
from
the
city
,
and
it
was
told
*NL*
the
viceroy
how
he
was
in
conversation
with
Don
Quixote
.
The
viceroy
,
*NL*
fancying
it
must
be
some
fresh
adventure
got
up
by
Don
Antonio
Moreno
or
*NL*
some
other
gentleman
of
the
city
,
hurried
out
at
once
to
the
beach
*NL*
accompanied
by
Don
Antonio
and
several
other
gentlemen
,
just
as
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
wheeling
Rocinante
round
in
order
to
take
up
the
necessary
*NL*
distance
.
The
viceroy
upon
this
,
seeing
that
the
pair
of
them
were
*NL*
evidently
preparing
to
come
to
the
charge
,
put
himself
between
them
,
*NL*
asking
them
what
it
was
that
led
them
to
engage
in
combat
all
of
a
sudden
*NL*
in
this
way
.
The
Knight
of
the
White
Moon
replied
that
it
was
a
question
*NL*
of
precedence
of
beauty
;
and
briefly
told
him
what
he
had
said
to
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
and
how
the
conditions
of
the
defiance
agreed
upon
on
both
sides
*NL*
had
been
accepted
.
The
viceroy
went
over
to
Don
Antonio
,
and
asked
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
did
he
know
who
the
Knight
of
the
White
Moon
was
,
or
was
it
*NL*
some
joke
they
were
playing
on
Don
Quixote
.
Don
Antonio
replied
that
he
*NL*
neither
knew
who
he
was
nor
whether
the
defiance
was
in
joke
or
in
*NL*
earnest
.
This
answer
left
the
viceroy
in
a
state
of
perplexity
,
not
*NL*
knowing
whether
he
ought
to
let
the
combat
go
on
or
not
;
but
unable
to
*NL*
persuade
himself
that
it
was
anything
but
a
joke
he
fell
back
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
If
there
be
no
other
way
out
of
it
,
gallant
knights
,
except
to
confess
*NL*
or
die
,
and
Don
Quixote
is
inflexible
,
and
your
worship
of
the
White
Moon
*NL*
still
more
so
,
in
God
's
hand
be
it
,
and
fall
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
of
the
White
Moon
thanked
the
viceroy
in
courteous
and
well-chosen
*NL*
words
for
the
permission
he
gave
them
,
and
so
did
Don
Quixote
,
who
then
,
*NL*
commending
himself
with
all
his
heart
to
heaven
and
to
his
Dulcinea
,
as
*NL*
was
his
custom
on
the
eve
of
any
combat
that
awaited
him
,
proceeded
to
*NL*
take
a
little
more
distance
,
as
he
saw
his
antagonist
was
doing
the
same
;
*NL*
then
,
without
blast
of
trumpet
or
other
warlike
instrument
to
give
them
*NL*
the
signal
to
charge
,
both
at
the
same
instant
wheeled
their
horses
;
and
*NL*
he
of
the
White
Moon
,
being
the
swifter
,
met
Don
Quixote
after
having
*NL*
traversed
two-thirds
of
the
course
,
and
there
encountered
him
with
such
*NL*
violence
that
,
without
touching
him
with
his
lance
-LRB-
for
he
held
it
high
,
*NL*
to
all
appearance
purposely
-RRB-
,
he
hurled
Don
Quixote
and
Rocinante
to
the
*NL*
earth
,
a
perilous
fall
.
He
sprang
upon
him
at
once
,
and
placing
the
lance
*NL*
over
his
visor
said
to
him
,
``
You
are
vanquished
,
sir
knight
,
nay
dead
*NL*
unless
you
admit
the
conditions
of
our
defiance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
bruised
and
stupefied
,
without
raising
his
visor
said
in
a
*NL*
weak
feeble
voice
as
if
he
were
speaking
out
of
a
tomb
,
``
Dulcinea
del
*NL*
Toboso
is
the
fairest
woman
in
the
world
,
and
I
the
most
unfortunate
*NL*
knight
on
earth
;
it
is
not
fitting
that
this
truth
should
suffer
by
my
*NL*
feebleness
;
drive
your
lance
home
,
sir
knight
,
and
take
my
life
,
since
*NL*
you
have
taken
away
my
honour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
I
not
,
in
sooth
,
''
said
he
of
the
White
Moon
;
``
live
the
fame
of
*NL*
the
lady
Dulcinea
's
beauty
undimmed
as
ever
;
all
I
require
is
that
the
*NL*
great
Don
Quixote
retire
to
his
own
home
for
a
year
,
or
for
so
long
a
*NL*
time
as
shall
by
me
be
enjoined
upon
him
,
as
we
agreed
before
engaging
in
*NL*
this
combat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
viceroy
,
Don
Antonio
,
and
several
others
who
were
present
heard
all
*NL*
this
,
and
heard
too
how
Don
Quixote
replied
that
so
long
as
nothing
in
*NL*
prejudice
of
Dulcinea
was
demanded
of
him
,
he
would
observe
all
the
rest
*NL*
like
a
true
and
loyal
knight
.
The
engagement
given
,
he
of
the
White
Moon
*NL*
wheeled
about
,
and
making
obeisance
to
the
viceroy
with
a
movement
of
the
*NL*
head
,
rode
away
into
the
city
at
a
half
gallop
.
The
viceroy
bade
Don
*NL*
Antonio
hasten
after
him
,
and
by
some
means
or
other
find
out
who
he
was
.
*NL*
They
raised
Don
Quixote
up
and
uncovered
his
face
,
and
found
him
pale
and
*NL*
bathed
with
sweat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rocinante
from
the
mere
hard
measure
he
had
received
lay
unable
to
stir
*NL*
for
the
present
.
Sancho
,
wholly
dejected
and
woebegone
,
knew
not
what
to
*NL*
say
or
do
.
He
fancied
that
all
was
a
dream
,
that
the
whole
business
was
a
*NL*
piece
of
enchantment
.
Here
was
his
master
defeated
,
and
bound
not
to
take
*NL*
up
arms
for
a
year
.
He
saw
the
light
of
the
glory
of
his
achievements
*NL*
obscured
;
the
hopes
of
the
promises
lately
made
him
swept
away
like
smoke
*NL*
before
the
wind
;
Rocinante
,
he
feared
,
was
crippled
for
life
,
and
his
*NL*
master
's
bones
out
of
joint
;
for
if
he
were
only
shaken
out
of
his
*NL*
madness
it
would
be
no
small
luck
.
In
the
end
they
carried
him
into
the
*NL*
city
in
a
hand-chair
which
the
viceroy
sent
for
,
and
thither
the
viceroy
*NL*
himself
returned
,
eager
to
ascertain
who
this
Knight
of
the
White
Moon
*NL*
was
who
had
left
Don
Quixote
in
such
a
sad
plight

*NL*
Don
Antonia
Moreno
followed
the
Knight
of
the
White
Moon
,
and
a
number
of
*NL*
boys
followed
him
too
,
nay
pursued
him
,
until
they
had
him
fairly
housed
*NL*
in
a
hostel
in
the
heart
of
the
city
.
Don
Antonio
,
eager
to
make
his
*NL*
acquaintance
,
entered
also
;
a
squire
came
out
to
meet
him
and
remove
his
*NL*
armour
,
and
he
shut
himself
into
a
lower
room
,
still
attended
by
Don
*NL*
Antonio
,
whose
bread
would
not
bake
until
he
had
found
out
who
he
was
.
He
*NL*
of
the
White
Moon
,
seeing
then
that
the
gentleman
would
not
leave
him
,
*NL*
said
,
``
I

well

senor

what
you

it

find
out

I
should
conceal
it
from
you

while

off

I
am

whose
craze
and
folly
make
all
of
us
who

know
him
feel
pity
for
him

I
am
one
of
those
who
have
felt
it
most

*NL*
and
persuaded
that
his
chance
of
recovery
lay
in
quiet
and
keeping
at
*NL*
home
and
in
his
own
house
,
I
hit
upon
a
device
for
keeping
him
there
.
*NL*
Three
months
ago
,
therefore
,
I
went
out
to
meet
him
as
a
knight-errant
,
*NL*
under
the
assumed
name
of
the
Knight
of
the
Mirrors
,
intending
to
engage
*NL*
him
in
combat
and
overcome
him
without
hurting
him
,
making
it
the
*NL*
condition
of
our
combat
that
the
vanquished
should
be
at
the
disposal
of
*NL*
the
victor
.
What
I
meant
to
demand
of
him
-LRB-
for
I
regarded
him
as
*NL*
vanquished
already
-RRB-
was
that
he
should
return
to
his
own
village
,
and
not
*NL*
leave
it
for
a
whole
year
,
by
which
time
he
might
be
cured
.
But
fate
*NL*
ordered
it
otherwise
,
for
he
vanquished
me
and
unhorsed
me
,
and
so
my
*NL*
plan
failed
.
He
went
his
way
,
and
I
came
back
conquered
,
covered
with
*NL*
shame
,
and
sorely
bruised
by
my
fall
,
which
was
a
particularly
dangerous
*NL*
one
.
But
this
did
not
quench
my
desire
to
meet
him
again
and
overcome
*NL*
him
,
as
you
have
seen
to-day
.
And
as
he
is
so
scrupulous
in
his
*NL*
observance
of
the
laws
of
knight-errantry
,
he
will
,
no
doubt
,
in
order
to
*NL*
keep
his
word
,
obey
the
injunction
I
have
laid
upon
him
.
This
,
senor
,
is
*NL*
how
the
matter
stands
,
and
I
have
nothing
more
to
tell
you
.
I
implore
of
*NL*
you
not
to
betray
me
,
or
tell
Don
Quixote
who
I
am
;
so
that
my
honest
*NL*
endeavours
may
be
successful
,
and
that
a
man
of
excellent
wits
--
were
he
*NL*
only
rid
of
the
fooleries
of
chivalry
--
may
get
them
back
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
senor
,
''
said
Don
Antonio
,
``
may
God
forgive
you
the
wrong
you
have
done
*NL*
the
whole
world
in
trying
to
bring
the
most
amusing
madman
in
it
back
to
*NL*
his
senses
.
Do
you
not
see
,
senor
,
that
the
gain
by
Don
Quixote
's
sanity
*NL*
can
never
equal
the
enjoyment
his
crazes
give
?
But
my
belief
is
that
all
*NL*
the
senor
bachelor
's
pains
will
be
of
no
avail
to
bring
a
man
so
*NL*
hopelessly
cracked
to
his
senses
again
;
and
if
it
were
not
uncharitable
,
*NL*
I
would
say
may
Don
Quixote
never
be
cured
,
for
by
his
recovery
we
lose
*NL*
not
only
his
own
drolleries
,
but
his
squire
Sancho
Panza
's
too
,
any
one
*NL*
of
which
is
enough
to
turn
melancholy
itself
into
merriment
.
However
,
*NL*
I
'll
hold
my
peace
and
say
nothing
to
him
,
and
we
'll
see
whether
I
am
*NL*
right
in
my
suspicion
that
Senor
Carrasco
's
efforts
will
be
fruitless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bachelor
replied
that
at
all
events
the
affair
promised
well
,
and
he
*NL*
hoped
for
a
happy
result
from
it
;
and
putting
his
services
at
Don
*NL*
Antonio
's
commands
he
took
his
leave
of
him
;
and
having
had
his
armour
*NL*
packed
at
once
upon
a
mule
,
he
rode
away
from
the
city
the
same
day
on
*NL*
the
horse
he
rode
to
battle
,
and
returned
to
his
own
country
without
*NL*
meeting
any
adventure
calling
for
record
in
this
veracious
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Antonio
reported
to
the
viceroy
what
Carrasco
told
him
,
and
the
*NL*
viceroy
was
not
very
well
pleased
to
hear
it
,
for
with
Don
Quixote
's
*NL*
retirement
there
was
an
end
to
the
amusement
of
all
who
knew
anything
of
*NL*
his
mad
doings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
days
did
Don
Quixote
keep
his
bed
,
dejected
,
melancholy
,
moody
and
*NL*
out
of
sorts
,
brooding
over
the
unhappy
event
of
his
defeat
.
Sancho
*NL*
strove
to
comfort
him
,
and
among
other
things
he
said
to
him
,
``
Hold
up
*NL*
your
head
,
senor
,
and
be
of
good
cheer
if
you
can
,
and
give
thanks
to
*NL*
heaven
that
if
you
have
had
a
tumble
to
the
ground
you
have
not
come
off
*NL*
with
a
broken
rib
;
and
,
as
you
know
that
`
where
they
give
they
take
,
'
and
*NL*
that
`
there
are
not
always
fletches
where
there
are
pegs
,
'
a
fig
for
the
*NL*
doctor
,
for
there
's
no
need
of
him
to
cure
this
ailment
.
Let
us
go
home
,
*NL*
and
give
over
going
about
in
search
of
adventures
in
strange
lands
and
*NL*
places
;
rightly
looked
at
,
it
is
I
that
am
the
greater
loser
,
though
it
*NL*
is
your
worship
that
has
had
the
worse
usage
.
With
the
government
I
gave
*NL*
up
all
wish
to
be
a
governor
again
,
but
I
did
not
give
up
all
longing
to
*NL*
be
a
count
;
and
that
will
never
come
to
pass
if
your
worship
gives
up
*NL*
becoming
a
king
by
renouncing
the
calling
of
chivalry
;
and
so
my
hopes
*NL*
are
going
to
turn
into
smoke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
thou
seest
my
suspension
and
*NL*
retirement
is
not
to
exceed
a
year
;
I
shall
soon
return
to
my
honoured
*NL*
calling
,
and
I
shall
not
be
at
a
loss
for
a
kingdom
to
win
and
a
county
*NL*
to
bestow
on
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
God
hear
it
and
sin
be
deaf
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
have
always
heard
say
*NL*
that
'
a
good
hope
is
better
than
a
bad
holding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
were
talking
Don
Antonio
came
in
looking
extremely
pleased
and
*NL*
exclaiming
,
``
Reward
me
for
my
good
news
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
!
Don
Gregorio
*NL*
and
the
renegade
who
went
for
him
have
come
ashore
--
ashore
do
I
say
?
They
*NL*
are
by
this
time
in
the
viceroy
's
house
,
and
will
be
here
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
cheered
up
a
little
and
said
,
``
Of
a
truth
I
am
almost
ready
*NL*
to
say
I
should
have
been
glad
had
it
turned
out
just
the
other
way
,
for
*NL*
it
would
have
obliged
me
to
cross
over
to
Barbary
,
where
by
the
might
of
*NL*
my
arm
I
should
have
restored
to
liberty
,
not
only
Don
Gregorio
,
but
all
*NL*
the
Christian
captives
there
are
in
Barbary
.
But
what
am
I
saying
,
*NL*
miserable
being
that
I
am
?
Am
I
not
he
that
has
been
conquered
?
Am
I
not
*NL*
he
that
has
been
overthrown
?
Am
I
not
he
who
must
not
take
up
arms
for
a
*NL*
year
?
Then
what
am
I
making
professions
for
;
what
am
I
bragging
about
;
*NL*
when
it
is
fitter
for
me
to
handle
the
distaff
than
the
sword
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
of
that
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
;
''
`
let
the
hen
live
,
even
though
it
*NL*
be
with
her
pip
;
`
today
for
thee
and
to-morrow
for
me
;
'
in
these
affairs
*NL*
of
encounters
and
whacks
one
must
not
mind
them
,
for
he
that
falls
to-day
*NL*
may
get
up
to-morrow
;
unless
indeed
he
chooses
to
lie
in
bed
,
I
mean
*NL*
gives
way
to
weakness
and
does
not
pluck
up
fresh
spirit
for
fresh
*NL*
battles
;
let
your
worship
get
up
now
to
receive
Don
Gregorio
;
for
the
*NL*
household
seems
to
be
in
a
bustle
,
and
no
doubt
he
has
come
by
this
*NL*
time
;
''
and
so
it
proved
,
for
as
soon
as
Don
Gregorio
and
the
renegade
had
*NL*
given
the
viceroy
an
account
of
the
voyage
out
and
home
,
Don
Gregorio
,
*NL*
eager
to
see
Ana
Felix
,
came
with
the
renegade
to
Don
Antonio
's
house
.
*NL*
When
they
carried
him
away
from
Algiers
he
was
in
woman
's
dress
;
on
board
*NL*
the
vessel
,
however
,
he
exchanged
it
for
that
of
a
captive
who
escaped
*NL*
with
him
;
but
in
whatever
dress
he
might
be
he
looked
like
one
to
be
*NL*
loved
and
served
and
esteemed
,
for
he
was
surpassingly
well-favoured
,
and
*NL*
to
judge
by
appearances
some
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
.
Ricote
*NL*
and
his
daughter
came
out
to
welcome
him
,
the
father
with
tears
,
the
*NL*
daughter
with
bashfulness
.
They
did
not
embrace
each
other
,
for
where
*NL*
there
is
deep
love
there
will
never
be
overmuch
boldness
.
Seen
side
by
*NL*
side
,
the
comeliness
of
Don
Gregorio
and
the
beauty
of
Ana
Felix
were
the
*NL*
admiration
of
all
who
were
present
.
It
was
silence
that
spoke
for
the
*NL*
lovers
at
that
moment
,
and
their
eyes
were
the
tongues
that
declared
*NL*
their
pure
and
happy
feelings
.
The
renegade
explained
the
measures
and
*NL*
means
he
had
adopted
to
rescue
Don
Gregorio
,
and
Don
Gregorio
at
no
great
*NL*
length
,
but
in
a
few
words
,
in
which
he
showed
that
his
intelligence
was
*NL*
in
advance
of
his
years
,
described
the
peril
and
embarrassment
he
found
*NL*
himself
in
among
the
women
with
whom
he
had
sojourned
.
To
conclude
,
*NL*
Ricote
liberally
recompensed
and
rewarded
as
well
the
renegade
as
the
men
*NL*
who
had
rowed
;
and
the
renegade
effected
his
readmission
into
the
body
of
*NL*
the
Church
and
was
reconciled
with
it
,
and
from
a
rotten
limb
became
by
*NL*
penance
and
repentance
a
clean
and
sound
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
the
viceroy
discussed
with
Don
Antonio
the
steps
they
*NL*
should
take
to
enable
Ana
Felix
and
her
father
to
stay
in
Spain
,
for
it
*NL*
seemed
to
them
there
could
be
no
objection
to
a
daughter
who
was
so
good
*NL*
a
Christian
and
a
father
to
all
appearance
so
well
disposed
remaining
*NL*
there
.
Don
Antonio
offered
to
arrange
the
matter
at
the
capital
,
whither
*NL*
he
was
compelled
to
go
on
some
other
business
,
hinting
that
many
a
*NL*
difficult
affair
was
settled
there
with
the
help
of
favour
and
bribes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Ricote
,
who
was
present
during
the
conversation
,
``
it
will
not
*NL*
do
to
rely
upon
favour
or
bribes
,
because
with
the
great
Don
Bernardino
*NL*
de
Velasco
,
Conde
de
Salazar
,
to
whom
his
Majesty
has
entrusted
our
*NL*
expulsion
,
neither
entreaties
nor
promises
,
bribes
nor
appeals
to
*NL*
compassion
,
are
of
any
use
;
for
though
it
is
true
he
mingles
mercy
with
*NL*
justice
,
still
,
seeing
that
the
whole
body
of
our
nation
is
tainted
and
*NL*
corrupt
,
he
applies
to
it
the
cautery
that
burns
rather
than
the
salve
*NL*
that
soothes
;
and
thus
,
by
prudence
,
sagacity
,
care
and
the
fear
he
*NL*
inspires
,
he
has
borne
on
his
mighty
shoulders
the
weight
of
this
great
*NL*
policy
and
carried
it
into
effect
,
all
our
schemes
and
plots
,
*NL*
importunities
and
wiles
,
being
ineffectual
to
blind
his
Argus
eyes
,
ever
*NL*
on
the
watch
lest
one
of
us
should
remain
behind
in
concealment
,
and
like
*NL*
a
hidden
root
come
in
course
of
time
to
sprout
and
bear
poisonous
fruit
*NL*
in
Spain
,
now
cleansed
,
and
relieved
of
the
fear
in
which
our
vast
*NL*
numbers
kept
it
.
Heroic
resolve
of
the
great
Philip
the
Third
,
and
*NL*
unparalleled
wisdom
to
have
entrusted
it
to
the
said
Don
Bernardino
de
*NL*
Velasco
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
said
Don
Antonio
,
``
when
I
am
there
I
will
make
all
*NL*
possible
efforts
,
and
let
heaven
do
as

Don

will
*NL*
come
with
me
to
relieve
the
anxiety
which
his
parents
must
be
suffering
*NL*
on
account
of
his
absence
;
Ana
Felix
will
remain
in
my
house
with
my
*NL*
wife
,
or
in
a
monastery
;
and
I
know
the
viceroy
will
be
glad
that
the
*NL*
worthy
Ricote
should
stay
with
him
until
we
see
what
terms
I
can
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
viceroy
agreed
to
all
that
was
proposed
;
but
Don
Gregorio
on
learning
*NL*
what
had
passed
declared
he
could
not
and
would
not
on
any
account
leave
*NL*
Ana
Felix
;
however
,
as
it
was
his
purpose
to
go
and
see
his
parents
and
*NL*
devise
some
way
of
returning
for
her
,
he
fell
in
with
the
proposed
*NL*
arrangement
.
Ana
Felix
remained
with
Don
Antonio
's
wife
,
and
Ricote
in
*NL*
the
viceroy
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
for
Don
Antonio
's
departure
came
;
and
two
days
later
that
for
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
and
Sancho
's
,
for
Don
Quixote
's
fall
did
not
suffer
him
to
take
*NL*
the
road
sooner
.
There
were
tears
and
sighs
,
swoonings
and
sobs
,
at
the
*NL*
parting
between
Don
Gregorio
and
Ana
Felix
.
Ricote
offered
Don
Gregorio
a
*NL*
thousand
crowns
if
he
would
have
them
,
but
he
would
not
take
any
save
*NL*
five
which
Don
Antonio
lent
him
and
he
promised
to
repay
at
the
capital
.
*NL*
So
the
two
of
them
took
their
departure
,
and
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
*NL*
afterwards
,
as
has
been
already
said
,
Don
Quixote
without
his
armour
and
*NL*
in
travelling
gear
,
and
Sancho
on
foot
,
Dapple
being
loaded
with
the
*NL*
armour

As
he
left
Barcelona
,
Don
Quixote
turned
gaze
upon
the
spot
where
he
had
*NL*
fallen
.
``
Here
Troy
was
,
''
said
he
;
``
here
my
ill-luck
,
not
my
cowardice
,
*NL*
robbed
me
of
all
the
glory
I
had
won
;
here
Fortune
made
me
the
victim
of
*NL*
her
caprices
;
here
the
lustre
of
my
achievements
was
dimmed
;
here
,
in
a
*NL*
word
,
fell
my
happiness
never
to
rise
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
said
Sancho
on
hearing
this
,
``
it
is
the
part
of
brave
hearts
to
*NL*
be
patient
in
adversity
just
as
much
as
to
be
glad
in
prosperity
;
I
judge
*NL*
by
myself
,
for
,
if
when
I
was
a
governor
I
was
glad
,
now
that
I
am
a
*NL*
squire
and
on
foot
I
am
not
sad
;
and
I
have
heard
say
that
she
whom
*NL*
commonly
they
call
Fortune
is
a
drunken
whimsical
jade
,
and
,
what
is
*NL*
more
,
blind
,
and
therefore
neither
sees
what
she
does
,
nor
knows
whom
she
*NL*
casts
down
or
whom
she
sets
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
a
great
philosopher
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
thou
speakest
*NL*
very
sensibly
;
I
know
not
who
taught
thee
.
But
I
can
tell
thee
there
is
*NL*
no
such
thing
as
Fortune
in
the
world
,
nor
does
anything
which
takes
*NL*
place
there
,
be
it
good
or
bad
,
come
about
by
chance
,
but
by
the
special
*NL*
preordination
of
heaven
;
and
hence
the
common
saying
that
`
each
of
us
is
*NL*
the
maker
of
his
own
Fortune
.
'
I
have
been
that
of
mine
;
but
not
with
the
*NL*
proper
amount
of
prudence
,
and
my
self-confidence
has
therefore
made
me
*NL*
pay
dearly
;
for
I
ought
to
have
reflected
that
Rocinante
's
feeble
*NL*
strength
could
not
resist
the
mighty
bulk
of
the
Knight
of
the
White
*NL*
Moon
's
horse
.
In
a
word
,
I
ventured
it
,
I
did
my
best
,
I
was
overthrown
,
*NL*
but
though
I
lost
my
honour
I
did
not
lose
nor
can
I
lose
the
virtue
of
*NL*
keeping
my
word
.
When
I
was
a
knight-errant
,
daring
and
valiant
,
I
*NL*
supported
my
achievements
by
hand
and
deed
,
and
now
that
I
am
a
humble
*NL*
squire
I
will
support
my
words
by
keeping
the
promise
I
have
given
.
*NL*
Forward
then
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
let
us
go
to
keep
the
year
of
the
*NL*
novitiate
in
our
own
country
,
and
in
that
seclusion
we
shall
pick
up
*NL*
fresh
strength
to
return
to
the
by
me
never-forgotten
calling
of
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
returned
Sancho
,
``
travelling
on
foot
is
not
such
a
pleasant
*NL*
thing
that
it
makes
me
feel
disposed
or
tempted
to
make
long
marches
.
Let
*NL*
us
leave
this
armour
hung
up
on
some
tree
,
instead
of
some
one
that
has
*NL*
been
hanged
;
and
then
with
me
on
Dapple
's
back
and
my
feet
off
the
ground
*NL*
we
will
arrange
the
stages
as
your
worship
pleases
to
measure
them
out
;
*NL*
but
to
suppose
that
I
am
going
to
travel
on
foot
,
and
make
long
ones
,
is
*NL*
to
suppose
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
sayest
well
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
let
my
armour
be
hung
up
*NL*
for
a
trophy
,
and
under
it
or
round
it
we
will
carve
on
the
trees
what
*NL*
was
inscribed
on
the
trophy
of
Roland
's
armour
--
*NL*
*NL*
These
let
none
move
*NL*
Who
dareth
not
his
might
with
Roland
prove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
very
thing
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
and
if
it
was
not
that
we
should
*NL*
feel
the
want
of
Rocinante
on
the
road
,
it
would
be
as
well
to
leave
him
*NL*
hung
up
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
I
had
rather
not
have
either
him
or
the
armour
hung
up
,
''
said
*NL*
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
it
may
not
be
said
,
`
for
good
service
a
bad
return
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
is
right
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
,
as
sensible
people
hold
,
`
the
*NL*
fault
of
the
ass
must
not
be
laid
on
the
pack-saddle
;
'
and
,
as
in
this
*NL*
affair
the
fault
is
your
worship
's
,
punish
yourself
and
do
n't
let
your
*NL*
anger
break
out
against
the
already
battered
and
bloody
armour
,
or
the
*NL*
meekness
of
Rocinante
,
or
the
tenderness
of
my
feet
,
trying
to
make
them
*NL*
travel
more
than
is
reasonable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
converse
of
this
sort
the
whole
of
that
day
went
by
,
as
did
the
four
*NL*
succeeding
ones
,
without
anything
occurring
to
interrupt
their
journey
,
*NL*
but
on
the
fifth
as
they
entered
a
village
they
found
a
great
number
of
*NL*
people
at
the
door
of
an
inn
enjoying
themselves
,
as
it
was
a
holiday
.
*NL*
Upon
Don
Quixote
's
approach
a
peasant
called
out
,
``
One
of
these
two
*NL*
gentlemen
who
come
here
,
and
who
do
n't
know
the
parties
,
will
tell
us
*NL*
what
we
ought
to
do
about
our
wager
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
,
certainly
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
according
to
the
rights
*NL*
of
the
case
,
if
I
can
manage
to
understand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
it
is
,
worthy
sir
,
''
said
the
peasant
;
``
a
man
of
this
village
*NL*
who
is
so
fat
that
he
weighs
twenty
stone
challenged
another
,
a
neighbour
*NL*
of
his
,
who
does
not
weigh
more
than
nine
,
to
run
a
race
.
The
agreement
*NL*
was
that
they
were
to
run
a
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
with
equal
*NL*
weights
;
and
when
the
challenger
was
asked
how
the
weights
were
to
be
*NL*
equalised
he
said
that
the
other
,
as
he
weighed
nine
stone
,
should
put
*NL*
eleven
in
iron
on
his
back
,
and
that
in
this
way
the
twenty
stone
of
the
*NL*
thin
man
would
equal
the
twenty
stone
of
the
fat
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
exclaimed
Sancho
at
once
,
before
Don
Quixote
could
answer
;
*NL*
``
it
's
for
me
,
that
only
a
few
days
ago
left
off
being
a
governor
and
a
*NL*
judge
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
to
settle
these
doubtful
questions
and
*NL*
give
an
opinion
in
disputes
of
all
sorts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
in
God
's
name
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
I
am
not
*NL*
fit
to
give
crumbs
to
a
cat
,
my
wits
are
so
confused
and
upset
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
permission
Sancho
said
to
the
peasants
who
stood
clustered
*NL*
round
him
,
waiting
with
open
mouths
for
the
decision
to
come
from
his
,
*NL*
``
Brothers
,
what
the
fat
man
requires
is
not
in
reason
,
nor
has
it
a
*NL*
shadow
of
justice
in
it
;
because
,
if
it
be
true
,
as
they
say
,
that
the
*NL*
challenged
may
choose
the
weapons
,
the
other
has
no
right
to
choose
such
*NL*
as
will
prevent
and
keep
him
from
winning
.
My
decision
,
therefore
,
is
*NL*
that
the
fat
challenger
prune
,
peel
,
thin
,
trim
and
correct
himself
,
and
*NL*
take
eleven
stone
of
his
flesh
off
his
body
,
here
or
there
,
as
he
*NL*
pleases
,
and
as
suits
him
best
;
and
being
in
this
way
reduced
to
nine
*NL*
stone
weight
,
he
will
make
himself
equal
and
even
with
nine
stone
of
his
*NL*
opponent
,
and
they
will
be
able
to
run
on
equal
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
that
's
good
,
''
said
one
of
the
peasants
as
he
heard
Sancho
's
*NL*
decision
,
``
but
the
gentleman
has
spoken
like
a
saint
,
and
given
judgment
*NL*
like
a
canon
!
But
I
'll
be
bound
the
fat
man
wo
n't
part
with
an
ounce
of
*NL*
his
flesh
,
not
to
say
eleven
stone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
plan
will
be
for
them
not
to
run
,
''
said
another
,
``
so
that
*NL*
neither
the
thin
man
break
down
under
the
weight
,
nor
the
fat
one
strip
*NL*
himself
of
his
flesh
;
let
half
the
wager
be
spent
in
wine
,
and
let
's
take
*NL*
these
gentlemen
to
the
tavern
where
there
's
the
best
,
and
`
over
me
be
the
*NL*
cloak
when
it
rains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
sirs
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
I
can
not
stop
for
an
instant
,
*NL*
for
sad
thoughts
and
unhappy
circumstances
force
me
to
seem
discourteous
*NL*
and
to
travel
apace
;
''
and
spurring
Rocinante
he
pushed
on
,
leaving
them
*NL*
wondering
at
what
they
had
seen
and
heard
,
at
his
own
strange
figure
and
*NL*
at
the
shrewdness
of
his
servant
,
for
such
they
took
Sancho
to
be
;
and
*NL*
another
of
them
observed
,
``
If
the
servant
is
so
clever
,
what
must
the
*NL*
master
be
?
I
'll
bet
,
if
they
are
going
to
Salamanca
to
study
,
they
'll
*NL*
come
to
be
alcaldes
of
the
Court
in
a
trice
;
for
it
's
a
mere
joke
--
only
*NL*
to
read
and
read
,
and
have
interest
and
good
luck
;
and
before
a
man
knows
*NL*
where
he
is
he
finds
himself
with
a
staff
in
his
hand
or
a
mitre
on
his
*NL*
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
master
and
man
passed
out
in
the
fields
in
the
open
air
,
and
*NL*
the
next
day
as
they
were
pursuing
their
journey
they
saw
coming
towards
*NL*
them
a
man
on
foot
with
alforjas
at
the
neck
and
a
javelin
or
spiked
*NL*
staff
in
his
hand
,
the
very
cut
of
a
foot
courier
;
who
,
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
came
close
to
Don
Quixote
,
increased
his
pace
and
half
running
came
up
to
*NL*
him
,
and
embracing
his
right
thigh
,
for
he
could
reach
no
higher
,
*NL*
exclaimed
with
evident
pleasure
,
``
O
Senor
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
what
*NL*
happiness
it
will
be
to
the
heart
of
my
lord
the
duke
when
he
knows
your
*NL*
worship
is
coming
back
to
his
castle

for
he
is
still
there
with
my
lady
*NL*
the
duchess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
recognise
you

Don
Quixote
,
``
nor
do
I

you
are

*NL*
``
I

*NL*
the
courier
;

daughter

Rodriguez

*NL*
*NL*
``

exclaimed
Don

;
``
is
it
possible
that
you
are
the
*NL*
one

mine
enemies

enchanters
changed
into
the
lacquey
you
speak
*NL*
of
in

to
rob
me
of
the
honour
of
that
battle
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
good
sir
!
''
said
the
messenger
;
``
there
was
no
enchantment
or
*NL*
transformation
at
all
;
I
entered
the
lists
just
as
much
lacquey
Tosilos
*NL*
as
I
came
out
of
them
lacquey
Tosilos
.
I
thought
to
marry
without
*NL*
fighting
,
for
the
girl
had
taken
my
fancy
;
but
my
scheme
had
a
very
*NL*
different
result
,
for
as
soon
as
your
worship
had
left
the
castle
my
lord
*NL*
the
duke
had
a
hundred
strokes
of
the
stick
given
me
for
having
acted
*NL*
contrary
to
the
orders
he
gave
me
before
engaging
in
the
combat
;
and
the
*NL*
end
of
the
whole
affair
is
that
the
girl
has
become
a
nun
,
and
Dona
*NL*
Rodriguez
has
gone
back
to
Castile
,
and
I
am
now
on
my
way
to
Barcelona

with
a
packet

letters

viceroy

my
master
is
sending
him

*NL*
If
your
worship
would
like
a
drop
,
sound
though
warm
,
I
have
a
gourd
here
*NL*
full
of
the
best
,
and
some
scraps
of
Tronchon
cheese
that
will
serve
as
a
*NL*
provocative
and
wakener
of
your
thirst
if
so
be
it
is
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
the
offer

said
Sancho
;
``
no
more
compliments
about
it

pour
out

good
Tosilos

Indies

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
indeed
the
greatest
glutton
in

Sancho

said
Don
*NL*

,

booby

this
Tosilos
a
sham

stop
with

*NL*
take
thy
fill

I
will
go
on
slowly

wait

come
up

*NL*
*NL*
The
lacquey
laughed
,
unsheathed
his
gourd
,
unwalletted
his
scraps
,
and
*NL*
taking
out
a
small
loaf
of
bread
he
and
Sancho
seated
themselves
on
the
*NL*
green
grass
,
and
in
peace
and
good
fellowship
finished
off
the
contents
*NL*
of
the
alforjas
down
to
the
bottom
,
so
resolutely
that
they
licked
the
*NL*
wrapper
of
the
letters
,
merely
because
it
smelt
of
cheese
.
*NL*
*NL*
Said
Tosilos
to
Sancho
,
``
Beyond
a
doubt
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
this
master
of
*NL*
thine
ought
to
be
a
madman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ought
!
''
said
Sancho
;
``
he
owes
no
man
anything
;
he
pays
for
everything

*NL*
particularly
when
the
coin
is
madness
.
I
see
it
plain
enough
,
and
I
tell
*NL*
him
so
plain
enough
;
but
what
's
the
use
?
especially
now
that
it
is
all
*NL*
over
with
him
,
for
here
he
is
beaten
by
the
Knight
of
the
White
Moon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tosilos
begged
him
to
explain
what
had
happened
him
,
but
Sancho
replied
*NL*
that
it
would
not
be
good
manners
to
leave
his
master
waiting
for
him
;
*NL*
and
that
some
other
day
if
they
met
there
would
be
time
enough
for
that
;
*NL*
and
then
getting
up
,
after
shaking
his
doublet
and
brushing
the
crumbs
*NL*
out
of
his
beard
,
he
drove
Dapple
on
before
him
,
and
bidding
adieu
to
*NL*
Tosilos
left
him
and
rejoined
his
master
,
who
was
waiting
for
him
under

the
shade
of

If
a

of
reflections
used
to
harass
Don

before
he
had
*NL*
been
overthrown
,
a
great
many
more
harassed
him
since
his
fall

He
was
*NL*
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
,
as
has
been
said
,
and
there
,
like
flies
on
*NL*
honey
,
thoughts
came
crowding
upon
him
and
stinging
him
.
Some
of
them
*NL*
turned
upon
the
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
,
others
upon
the
life
he
was
*NL*
about
to
lead
in
his
enforced
retirement
.
Sancho
came
up
and
spoke
in
*NL*
high
praise
of
the
generous
disposition
of
the
lacquey
Tosilos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
thou
dost
still
think
*NL*
that
he
yonder
is
a
real
lacquey
?
Apparently
it
has
escaped
thy
memory
*NL*
that
thou
hast
seen
Dulcinea
turned
and
transformed
into
a
peasant
wench
,
*NL*
and
the
Knight
of
the
Mirrors
into
the
bachelor
Carrasco
;
all
the
work
of
*NL*
the
enchanters
that
persecute
me
.
But
tell
me
now
,
didst
thou
ask
this
*NL*
Tosilos
,
as
thou
callest
him
,
what
has
become
of
Altisidora
,
did
she
weep
*NL*
over
my
absence
,
or
has
she
already
consigned
to
oblivion
the
love
*NL*
thoughts
that
used
to
afflict
her
when
I
was
present
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thoughts
that
I
had
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
were
not
such
as
to
leave
time
*NL*
for
asking
fool
's
questions
.
Body
o
'
me
,
senor
!
is
your
worship
in
a
*NL*
condition
now
to
inquire
into
other
people
's
thoughts
,
above
all
love
*NL*
thoughts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
ye
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
there
is
a
great
difference
between
*NL*
what
is
done
out
of
love
and
what
is
done
out
of
gratitude
.
A
knight
may
*NL*
very
possibly
be
proof
against
love
;
but
it
is
impossible
,
strictly
*NL*
speaking
,
for
him
to
be
ungrateful
.
Altisidora
,
to
all
appearance
,
loved
*NL*
me
truly
;
she
gave
me
the
three
kerchiefs
thou
knowest
of
;
she
wept
at
my
*NL*
departure
,
she
cursed
me
,
she
abused
me
,
casting
shame
to
the
winds
she
*NL*
bewailed
herself
in
public
;
all
signs
that
she
adored
me
;
for
the
wrath
*NL*
of
lovers
always
ends
in
curses
.
I
had
no
hopes
to
give
her
,
nor
*NL*
treasures
to
offer
her
,
for
mine
are
given
to
Dulcinea
,
and
the
treasures
*NL*
of
knights-errant
are
like
those
of
the
fairies
,
'
illusory
and
deceptive
;
*NL*
all
I
can
give
her
is
the
place
in
my
memory
I
keep
for
her
,
without
*NL*
prejudice
,
however
,
to
that
which
I
hold
devoted
to
Dulcinea
,
whom
thou
*NL*
art
wronging
by
thy
remissness
in
whipping
thyself
and
scourging
that
*NL*
flesh
--
would
that
I
saw
it
eaten
by
wolves
--
which
would
rather
keep
*NL*
itself
for
the
worms
than
for
the
relief
of
that
poor
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
if
the
truth
is
to
be
told
,
I
can
not
persuade
*NL*
myself
that
the
whipping
of
my
backside
has
anything
to
do
with
the
*NL*
disenchantment
of
the
enchanted
;
it
is
like
saying
,
`
If
your
head
aches
*NL*
rub
ointment
on
your
knees
;
'
at
any
rate
I
'll
make
bold
to
swear
that
in
*NL*
all
the
histories
dealing
with
knight-errantry
that
your
worship
has
read
*NL*
you
have
never
come
across
anybody
disenchanted
by
whipping
;
but
whether
*NL*
or
no
I
'll
whip
myself
when
I
have
a
fancy
for
it
,
and
the
opportunity
*NL*
serves
for
scourging
myself
comfortably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
it
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
and
heaven
give
thee
grace
to
take
it
*NL*
to
heart
and
own
the
obligation
thou
art
under

my
lady

who
is
*NL*
thine
also

thou
art
mine

*NL*
*NL*
As
they
pursued
their
journey
talking
in
this
way
they
came
to
the
very
*NL*
same
spot
where
they
had
been
trampled
on
by
the
bulls
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
recognised
it
,
and
said
he
to
Sancho
,
``
This
is
the
meadow
where
we
came
*NL*
upon
those
gay
shepherdesses
and
gallant
shepherds
who
were
trying
to
*NL*
revive
and
imitate
the
pastoral
Arcadia
there
,
an
idea
as
novel
as
it
was
*NL*
happy
,
in
emulation
whereof
,
if
so
be
thou
dost
approve
of
it
,
Sancho
,
I
*NL*
would
have
ourselves
turn
shepherds
,
at
any
rate
for
the
time
I
have
to
*NL*
live
in
retirement
.
I
will
buy
some
ewes
and
everything
else
requisite
*NL*
for
the
pastoral
calling
;
and
,
I
under
the
name
of
the
shepherd
Quixotize
*NL*
and
thou
as
the
shepherd
Panzino
,
we
will
roam
the
woods
and
groves
and
*NL*
meadows
singing
songs
here
,
lamenting
in
elegies
there
,
drinking
of
the
*NL*
crystal
waters
of
the
springs

limpid
brooks
or
flowing
rivers

The
*NL*
oaks
will
yield
us
their
sweet
fruit
with
bountiful
hand
,

trunks
of

hard
cork

*NL*
widespread
meadows

tinted
with
a
thousand
dyes

give
us
breath

stars
lighten
the
darkness
of
the
*NL*
night

us

song
shall
be
our
delight
,
lamenting
our
joy
,
Apollo
will
*NL*
supply
us
with
verses
,
and

with
conceits
whereby
we
shall
make
*NL*
ourselves
famed
for
ever
,
not
only
in
this
but
in
ages
to
come

*NL*
*NL*
``
Egad

said
Sancho

not
come
into

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
in
the

of

Sancho

said
Don

the
*NL*
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
,
if
he
enters
the
pastoral
fraternity
,
as
no
*NL*
doubt
he
will
,
may
call
himself
the
shepherd
Samsonino
,
or
perhaps
the
*NL*
shepherd
Carrascon
;
Nicholas
the
barber
may
call
himself
Niculoso
,
as
old
*NL*
Boscan
formerly
was
called
Nemoroso

for
the
curate
I
do
n't

fit
to
him
unless
it
be
something
derived
from
his

*NL*
we
call
him
the
shepherd
Curiambro

For
the
shepherdesses
whose
lovers
we
*NL*
shall
be

we
can
pick
names

myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

Teresona

Sancho

which
will
go

well
with
her
stoutness

with

then

It
wo
n't
do
for

*NL*
to
have
a
shepherdess

for
the
sake
of
good
example
;

look-out

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
me

Sancho

said
Don

lead
!
What
hautboys
and
Zamora
bagpipes
we
shall
hear
,
what
tabors
,
*NL*
timbrels
,
and
rebecks
!
And
then
if
among
all
these
different
sorts
of
*NL*
music
that
of
the
albogues
is
heard
,
almost
all
the
pastoral
instruments
*NL*
will
be
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
albogues
?
''
asked
Sancho
,
``
for
I
never
in
my
life
heard
tell
of
*NL*
them
or
saw
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Albogues
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
are
brass
plates
like
candlesticks
that
*NL*
struck
against
one
another
on
the
hollow
side
make
a
noise
which
,
if
not
*NL*
very
pleasing
or
harmonious
,
is
not
disagreeable
and
accords
very
well
*NL*
with
the
rude
notes
of
the
bagpipe
and
tabor
.
The
word
albogue
is
*NL*
Morisco
,
as
are
all
those
in
our
Spanish
tongue
that
begin
with
al
;
for
*NL*
example
,
almohaza
,
almorzar
,
alhombra
,
alguacil
,
alhucema
,
almacen
,
*NL*
alcancia
,
and
others
of
the
same
sort
,
of
which
there
are
not
many
more
;
*NL*
our
language
has
only
three
that
are
Morisco
and
end
in
i
,
which
are
*NL*
borcegui
,
zaquizami
,
and
maravedi
.
Alheli
and
alfaqui
are
seen
to
be
*NL*
Arabic
,
as
well
by
the
al
at
the
beginning
as
by
the
i
they
end
with
.
I
*NL*
mention
this
incidentally
,
the
chance
allusion
to
albogues
having
*NL*
reminded
me
of
it
;
and
it
will
be
of
great
assistance
to
us
in
the
*NL*
perfect
practice
of
this
calling
that
I
am
something
of
a
poet
,
as
thou
*NL*
knowest
,
and
that
besides
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
is
an
accomplished
*NL*
one
.
Of
the
curate
I
say
nothing
;
but
I
will
wager
he
has
some
spice
of
*NL*
the
poet
in
him
,
and
no
doubt
Master
Nicholas
too
,
for
all
barbers
,
or
*NL*
most
of
them
,
are
guitar
players
and
stringers
of
verses
.
I
will
bewail
*NL*
my
separation
;
thou
shalt
glorify
thyself
as
a
constant
lover
;
the
*NL*
shepherd
Carrascon
will
figure
as
a
rejected
one
,
and
the
curate
*NL*
Curiambro
as
whatever
may
please
him
best
;
and
so
all
will
go
as
gaily
as
*NL*
heart
could
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Sancho
made
answer
,
``
I
am
so
unlucky

senor

that
I
'm
afraid
the

day

never
come

'll
see
myself
at
such
a
calling

O
what
neat
*NL*
spoons
I
'll
make
when

My

But
stay-she
's
good-looking

shepherds
there
are
with
more
mischief
than
simplicity
in
them

I
would

not

away

``

replied
Don

,
``
I
bring
in
proverbs
to
the
*NL*
purpose

when
I
quote
them
they
fit
like

ring

finger
;
thou

bringest
them
in
by

head

shoulders
,
in
such
a
way
that
thou
dost

drag
them
in

rather

introduce
them
;
if
I
am
not
mistaken

I
have
*NL*
told
thee
already
that
proverbs

short
maxims
drawn
from

observation

wise
men
of

;
but
the
proverb
that

is
not

a
piece

on

turned
aside

supped
late

poorly

very
much
against

turned
over

the
hardships

knight-errantry
in

even

at

plenty
*NL*
presented
itself

at

reflected

that

CHAPTER
LXVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
BRISTLY
ADVENTURE
THAT
BEFELL
DON
QUIXOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
somewhat
dark
,
for
though
there
was
a
moon
in
the
sky
it
*NL*
was
not
in
a
quarter
where
she
could
be
seen
;
for
sometimes
the
lady
*NL*
Diana
goes
on
a
stroll
to
the
antipodes
,
and
leaves
the
mountains
all
*NL*
black
and
the
valleys
in
darkness
.
Don
Quixote
obeyed
nature
so
far
as
to
*NL*
sleep
his
first
sleep
,
but
did
not
give
way
to
the
second
,
very
different
*NL*
from
Sancho
,
who
never
had
any
second
,
because
with
him
sleep
lasted
from
*NL*
night
till
morning
,
wherein
he
showed
what
a
sound
constitution
and
few
*NL*
cares
he
had
.
Don
Quixote
's
cares
kept
him
restless
,
so
much
so
that
he
*NL*
awoke
Sancho
and
said
to
him
,
``
I
am
amazed
,
Sancho
,
at
the
unconcern
of
*NL*
thy
temperament
.
I
believe
thou
art
made
of
marble
or
hard
brass
,
*NL*
incapable
of
any
emotion
or
feeling
whatever
.
I
lie
awake
while
thou
*NL*
sleepest
,
I
weep
while
thou
singest
,
I
am
faint
with
fasting
while
thou
*NL*
art
sluggish
and
torpid
from
pure
repletion
.
It
is
the
duty
of
good
*NL*
servants
to
share
the
sufferings
and
feel
the
sorrows
of
their
masters
,
*NL*
if
it
be
only
for
the
sake
of
appearances
.
See
the
calmness
of
the
night
,
*NL*
the
solitude
of
the
spot
,
inviting
us
to
break
our
slumbers
by
a
vigil
of
*NL*
some
sort
.
Rise
as
thou
livest
,
and
retire
a
little
distance
,
and
with
a
*NL*
good
heart
and
cheerful
courage
give
thyself
three
or
four
hundred
lashes
*NL*
on
account
of
Dulcinea
's
disenchantment
score
;
and
this
I
entreat
of
*NL*
thee
,
making
it
a
request
,
for
I
have
no
desire
to
come
to
grips
with
*NL*
thee
a
second
time
,
as
I
know
thou
hast
a
heavy
hand
.
As
soon
as
thou
*NL*
hast
laid
them
on
we
will
pass
the
rest
of
the
night
,
I
singing
my
*NL*
separation
,
thou
thy
constancy
,
making
a
beginning
at
once
with
the
*NL*
pastoral
life
we
are
to
follow
at
our
village
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Senor
,
''
replied
Sancho
,
``
I
'm
no
monk
to
get
up
out
of
the
middle
of
my
*NL*
sleep
and
scourge
myself
,
nor
does
it
seem
to
me
that
one
can
pass
from
*NL*
one
extreme
of
the
pain
of
whipping
to
the
other
of
music
.
Will
your
*NL*
worship
let
me
sleep
,
and
not
worry
me
about
whipping
myself
?
or
you
'll
*NL*
make
me
swear
never
to
touch
a
hair
of
my
doublet
,
not
to
say
my
flesh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
hard
heart
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
O
pitiless
squire
!
O
bread
*NL*
ill-bestowed
and
favours
ill-acknowledged
,
both
those
I
have
done
thee
*NL*
and
those
I
mean
to
do
thee
!
Through
me
hast
thou
seen
thyself
a
*NL*
governor
,
and
through
me
thou
seest
thyself
in
immediate
expectation
of
*NL*
being
a
count
,
or
obtaining
some
other
equivalent
title
,
for
I-post
*NL*
tenebras
spero
lucem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
that
is
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
all
I
know
is
that
so
long
as
*NL*
I
am
asleep
I
have
neither
fear
nor
hope
,
trouble
nor
glory
;
and
good
*NL*
luck
betide
him
that
invented
sleep
,
the
cloak
that
covers
over
all
a
*NL*
man
's
thoughts
,
the
food
that
removes
hunger
,
the
drink
that
drives
away
*NL*
thirst
,
the
fire
that
warms
the
cold
,
the
cold
that
tempers
the
heat
,
*NL*
and
,
to
wind
up
with
,
the
universal
coin
wherewith
everything
is
bought
,
*NL*
the
weight
and
balance
that
makes
the
shepherd
equal
with
the
king
and
*NL*
the
fool
with
the
wise
man
.
Sleep
,
I
have
heard
say
,
has
only
one
fault
,
*NL*
that
it
is
like
death
;
for
between
a
sleeping
man
and
a
dead
man
there
is
*NL*
very
little
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
have
I
heard
thee
speak
so
elegantly
as
now
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
*NL*
Quixote
;
``
and
here
I
begin
to
see
the
truth
of
the
proverb
thou
dost
*NL*
sometimes
quote
,
`
Not
with
whom
thou
art
bred
,
but
with
whom
thou
art
*NL*
fed
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
by
my
life
,
master
mine
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
it
's
not
I
that
am
stringing
*NL*
proverbs
now
,
for
they
drop
in
pairs
from
your
worship
's
mouth
faster
*NL*
than
from
mine
;
only
there
is
this
difference
between
mine
and
yours
,
*NL*
that
yours
are
well-timed
and
mine
are
untimely
;
but
anyhow
,
they
are
all
*NL*
proverbs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
they
became
aware
of
a
harsh
indistinct
noise
that
seemed
*NL*
to
spread
through
all
the
valleys
around
.
Don
Quixote
stood
up
and
laid
*NL*
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
Sancho
ensconced
himself
under
Dapple
and
*NL*
put
the
bundle
of
armour
on
one
side
of
him
and
the
ass
's
pack-saddle
on
*NL*
the
other
,
in
fear
and
trembling
as
great
as
Don
Quixote
's
perturbation
.
*NL*
Each
instant
the
noise
increased
and
came
nearer
to
the
two
terrified
*NL*
men
,
or
at
least
to
one
,
for
as
to
the
other
,
his
courage
is
known
to
*NL*
all
.
The
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
some
men
were
taking
above
six
*NL*
hundred
pigs
to
sell
at
a
fair
,
and
were
on
their
way
with
them
at
that
*NL*
hour
,
and
so
great
was
the
noise
they
made
and
their
grunting
and
*NL*
blowing
,
that
they
deafened
the
ears
of
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
Panza
,
and
*NL*
they
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
.
The
wide-spread
grunting
drove
came
*NL*
on
in
a
surging
mass
,
and
without
showing
any
respect
for
Don
Quixote
's
*NL*
dignity
or
Sancho
's
,
passed
right
over
the
pair
of
them
,
demolishing
*NL*
Sancho
's
entrenchments
,
and
not
only
upsetting
Don
Quixote
but
sweeping
*NL*
Rocinante
off
his
feet
into
the
bargain
;
and
what
with
the
trampling
and
*NL*
the
grunting
,
and
the
pace
at
which
the
unclean
beasts
went
,
pack-saddle
,
*NL*
armour
,
Dapple
and
Rocinante
were
left
scattered
on
the
ground
and
Sancho
*NL*
and
Don
Quixote
at
their
wits
'
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
got
up
as
well
as
he
could
and
begged
his
master
to
give
him
his
*NL*
sword
,
saying
he
wanted
to
kill
half
a
dozen
of
those
dirty
unmannerly
*NL*
pigs
,
for
he
had
by
this
time
found
out
that
that
was
what
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
be
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
this
insult
is
the
penalty
*NL*
of
my
sin
;
and
it
is
the
righteous
chastisement
of
heaven
that
jackals
*NL*
should
devour
a
vanquished
knight
,
and
wasps
sting
him
and
pigs
trample
*NL*
him
under
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
is
the
chastisement
of
heaven
,
too
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
*NL*
flies
should
prick
the
squires
of
vanquished
knights
,
and
lice
eat
them
,
*NL*
and
hunger
assail
them
.
If
we
squires
were
the
sons
of
the
knights
we
*NL*
serve
,
or
their
very
near
relations
,
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
the
penalty
*NL*
of
their
misdeeds
overtook
us
,
even
to
the
fourth
generation
.
But
what
*NL*
have
the
Panzas
to
do
with
the
Quixotes
?
Well
,
well
,
let
's
lie
down
again
*NL*
and
sleep
out
what
little
of
the
night
there
's
left
,
and
God
will
send
us
*NL*
dawn
and
we
shall
be
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sleep
thou
,
Sancho
,
''
returned
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
thou
wast
born
to
sleep
*NL*
as
I
was
born
to
watch
;
and
during
the
time
it
now
wants
of
dawn
I
will
*NL*
give
a
loose
rein
to
my
thoughts
,
and
seek
a
vent
for
them
in
a
little
*NL*
madrigal
which
,
unknown
to
thee
,
I
composed
in
my
head
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
the
thoughts
that
allow
one
to
make
*NL*
verses
can
not
be
of
great
consequence
;
let
your
worship
string
verses
as
*NL*
much
as
you
like
and
I
'll
sleep
as
much
as
I
can
;
''
and
forthwith
,
taking
*NL*
the
space
of
ground
he
required
,
he
muffled
himself
up
and
fell
into
a
*NL*
sound
sleep
,
undisturbed
by
bond
,
debt
,
or
trouble
of
any
sort
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
propped
up
against
the
trunk
of
a
beech
or
a
cork
tree
--
for
Cide
*NL*
Hamete
does
not
specify
what
kind
of
tree
it
was
--
sang
in
this
strain
to
*NL*
the
accompaniment
of
his
own
sighs
:
*NL*
*NL*
When
in
my
mind
*NL*
I
muse
,
O
Love
,
upon
thy
cruelty
,
*NL*
To
death
I
flee
,
*NL*
In
hope
therein
the
end
of
all
to
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
drawing
near
*NL*
That
welcome
haven
in
my
sea
of
woe
,
*NL*
Such
joy
I
know
,
*NL*
That
life
revives
,
and
still
I
linger
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
life
doth
slay
,
*NL*
And
death
again
to
life
restoreth
me
;
*NL*
Strange
destiny
,
*NL*
That
deals
with
life
and
death
as
with
a
play
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
accompanied
each
verse
with
many
sighs
and
not
a
few
tears
,
just
like
*NL*
one
whose
heart
was
pierced
with
grief
at
his
defeat
and
his
separation
*NL*
from
Dulcinea
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
daylight
came
,
and
the
sun
smote
Sancho
on
the
eyes
with
his
*NL*
beams
.
He
awoke
,
roused
himself
up
,
shook
himself
and
stretched
his
lazy
*NL*
limbs
,
and
seeing
the
havoc
the
pigs
had
made
with
his
stores
he
cursed
*NL*
the
drove
,
and
more
besides
.
Then
the
pair
resumed
their
journey
,
and
as
*NL*
evening
closed
in
they
saw
coming
towards
them
some
ten
men
on
horseback
*NL*
and
four
or
five
on
foot
.
Don
Quixote
's
heart
beat
quick
and
Sancho
's
*NL*
quailed
with
fear
,
for
the
persons
approaching
them
carried
lances
and
*NL*
bucklers
,
and
were
in
very
warlike
guise
.
Don
Quixote
turned
to
Sancho
*NL*
and
said
,
``
If
I
could
make
use
of
my
weapons
,
and
my
promise
had
not
tied
*NL*
my
hands
,
I
would
count
this
host
that
comes
against
us
but
cakes
and
*NL*
fancy
bread
;
but
perhaps
it
may
prove
something
different
from
what
we
*NL*
apprehend
.
''
The
men
on
horseback
now
came
up
,
and
raising
their
lances
*NL*
surrounded
Don
Quixote
in
silence
,
and
pointed
them
at
his
back
and
*NL*
breast
,
menacing
him
with
death
.
One
of
those
on
foot
,
putting
his
finger
*NL*
to
his
lips
as
a
sign
to
him
to
be
silent
,
seized
Rocinante
's
bridle
and
*NL*
drew
him
out
of
the
road
,
and
the
others
driving
Sancho
and
Dapple
before
*NL*
them
,
and
all
maintaining
a
strange
silence
,
followed
in
the
steps
of
the
*NL*
one
who
led
Don
Quixote
.
The
latter
two
or
three
times
attempted
to
ask
*NL*
where
they
were
taking
him
to
and
what
they
wanted
,
but
the
instant
he
*NL*
began
to
open
his
lips
they
threatened
to
close
them
with
the
points
of
*NL*
their
lances
;
and
Sancho
fared
the
same
way
,
for
the
moment
he
seemed
*NL*
about
to
speak
one
of
those
on
foot
punched
him
with
a
goad
,
and
Dapple
*NL*
likewise
,
as
if
he
too
wanted
to
talk
.
Night
set
in
,
they
quickened
their
*NL*
pace
,
and
the
fears
of
the
two
prisoners
grew
greater
,
especially
as
they
*NL*
heard
themselves
assailed
with
--
``
Get
on
,
ye
Troglodytes
;
''
``
Silence
,
ye
*NL*
barbarians
;
''
``
March
,
ye
cannibals
;
''
``
No
murmuring
,
ye
Scythians
;
''
``
Do
n't
*NL*
open
your
eyes
,
ye
murderous
Polyphemes
,
ye
blood-thirsty
lions
,
''
and
*NL*
suchlike
names
with
which
their
captors
harassed
the
ears
of
the
wretched
*NL*
master
and
man
.
Sancho
went
along
saying
to
himself
,
``
We
,
tortolites
,
*NL*
barbers
,
animals
!
I
do
n't
like
those
names
at
all
;
`
it
's
in
a
bad
wind
*NL*
our
corn
is
being
winnowed
;
'
`
misfortune
comes
upon
us
all
at
once
like
*NL*
sticks
on
a
dog
,
'
and
God
grant
it
may
be
no
worse
than
them
that
this
*NL*
unlucky
adventure
has
in
store
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
rode
completely
dazed
,
unable
with
the
aid
of
all
his
wits
to
*NL*
make
out
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
these
abusive
names
they
called
*NL*
them
,
and
the
only
conclusion
he
could
arrive
at
was
that
there
was
no
*NL*
good
to
be
hoped
for
and
much
evil
to
be
feared
.
And
now
,
about
an
hour
*NL*
after
midnight
,
they
reached
a
castle
which
Don
Quixote
saw
at
once
was
*NL*
the
duke
's
,
where
they
had
been
but
a
short
time
before
.
``
God
bless
me
!
''
*NL*
said
he
,
as
he
recognised
the
mansion
,
``
what
does
this
mean
?
It
is
all
*NL*
courtesy
and
politeness
in
this
house
;
but
with
the
vanquished
good
turns
*NL*
into
evil
,
and
evil
into
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
chief
court
of
the
castle
and
found
it
prepared
and
*NL*
fitted
up
in
a
style
that
added
to
their
amazement
and
doubled
their
*NL*
fears
,
as
will
be
seen
in
the
following
chapter

CHAPTER
LXIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
STRANGEST
AND
MOST
EXTRAORDINARY
ADVENTURE
THAT
BEFELL
DON
QUIXOTE
*NL*
IN
THE
WHOLE
COURSE
OF
THIS
GREAT
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
horsemen
dismounted
,
and
,
together
with
the
men
on
foot
,
without
a
*NL*
moment
's
delay
taking
up
Sancho
and
Don
Quixote
bodily
,
they
carried
them
*NL*
into
the
court
,
all
round
which
near
a
hundred
torches
fixed
in
sockets
*NL*
were
burning
,
besides
above
five
hundred
lamps
in
the
corridors
,
so
that
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
night
,
which
was
somewhat
dark
,
the
want
of
daylight
*NL*
could
not
be
perceived
.
In
the
middle
of
the
court
was
a
catafalque
,
*NL*
raised
about
two
yards
above
the
ground
and
covered
completely
by
an
*NL*
immense
canopy
of
black
velvet
,
and
on
the
steps
all
round
it
white
wax
*NL*
tapers
burned
in
more
than
a
hundred
silver
candlesticks
.
Upon
the
*NL*
catafalque
was
seen
the
dead
body
of
a
damsel
so
lovely
that
by
her
*NL*
beauty
she
made
death
itself
look
beautiful
.
She
lay
with
her
head
*NL*
resting
upon
a
cushion
of
brocade
and
crowned
with
a
garland
of
*NL*
sweet-smelling
flowers
of
divers
sorts
,
her
hands
crossed
upon
her
bosom
,
*NL*
and
between
them
a
branch
of
yellow
palm
of
victory
.
On
one
side
of
the
*NL*
court
was
erected
a
stage
,
where
upon
two
chairs
were
seated
two
persons
*NL*
who
from
having
crowns
on
their
heads
and
sceptres
in
their
hands
*NL*
appeared
to
be
kings
of
some
sort
,
whether
real
or
mock
ones
.
By
the
side
*NL*
of
this
stage
,
which
was
reached
by
steps
,
were
two
other
chairs
on
which
*NL*
the
men
carrying
the
prisoners
seated
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
,
all
in
*NL*
silence
,
and
by
signs
giving
them
to
understand
that
they
too
were
to
be
*NL*
silent
;
which
,
however
,
they
would
have
been
without
any
signs
,
for
their
*NL*
amazement
at
all
they
saw
held
them
tongue-tied
.
And
now
two
persons
of
*NL*
distinction
,
who
were
at
once
recognised
by
Don
Quixote
as
his
hosts
the
*NL*
duke
and
duchess
,
ascended
the
stage
attended
by
a
numerous
suite
,
and
*NL*
seated
themselves
on
two
gorgeous
chairs
close
to
the
two
kings
,
as
they
*NL*
seemed
to
be
.
Who
would
not
have
been
amazed
at
this
?
Nor
was
this
all
,
*NL*
for
Don
Quixote
had
perceived
that
the
dead
body
on
the
catafalque
was
*NL*
that
of
the
fair
Altisidora
.
As
the
duke
and
duchess
mounted
the
stage
*NL*
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
rose
and
made
them
a
profound
obeisance
,
which
*NL*
they
returned
by
bowing
their
heads
slightly
.
At
this
moment
an
official
*NL*
crossed
over
,
and
approaching
Sancho
threw
over
him
a
robe
of
black
*NL*
buckram
painted
all
over
with
flames
of
fire
,
and
taking
off
his
cap
put
*NL*
upon
his
head
a
mitre
such
as
those
undergoing
the
sentence
of
the
Holy
*NL*
Office
wear
;
and
whispered
in
his
ear
that
he
must
not
open
his
lips
,
or
*NL*
they
would
put
a
gag
upon
him
,
or
take
his
life
.
Sancho
surveyed
himself
*NL*
from
head
to
foot
and
saw
himself
all
ablaze
with
flames
;
but
as
they
did
*NL*
not
burn
him
,
he
did
not
care
two
farthings
for
them
.
He
took
off
the
*NL*
mitre
,
and
seeing
it
painted
with
devils
he
put
it
on
again
,
saying
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
Well
,
so
far
those
do
n't
burn
me
nor
do
these
carry
me
off
.
''
*NL*
Don
Quixote
surveyed
him
too
,
and
though
fear
had
got
the
better
of
his
*NL*
faculties
,
he
could
not
help
smiling
to
see
the
figure
Sancho
presented
.
*NL*
And
now
from
underneath
the
catafalque
,
so
it
seemed
,
there
rose
a
low
*NL*
sweet
sound
of
flutes
,
which
,
coming
unbroken
by
human
voice
-LRB-
for
there
*NL*
silence
itself
kept
silence
-RRB-
,
had
a
soft
and
languishing
effect
.
Then
,
*NL*
beside
the
pillow
of
what
seemed
to
be
the
dead
body
,
suddenly
appeared
a
*NL*
fair
youth
in
a
Roman
habit
,
who
,
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
harp
which
he
*NL*
himself
played
,
sang
in
a
sweet
and
clear
voice
these
two
stanzas
:
*NL*
*NL*
While
fair
Altisidora
,
who
the
sport
*NL*
Of
cold
Don
Quixote
's
cruelty
hath
been
,
*NL*
Returns
to
life
,
and
in
this
magic
court
*NL*
The
dames
in
sables
come
to
grace
the
scene
,
*NL*
And
while
her
matrons
all
in
seemly
sort
*NL*
My
lady
robes
in
baize
and
bombazine
,
*NL*
Her
beauty
and
her
sorrows
will
I
sing
*NL*
With
defter
quill
than
touched
the
Thracian
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
in
life
alone
,
methinks
,
to
me
*NL*
Belongs
the
office
;
Lady
,
when
my
tongue
*NL*
Is
cold
in
death
,
believe
me
,
unto
thee
*NL*
My
voice
shall
raise
its
tributary
song
.
*NL*
My
soul
,
from
this
strait
prison-house
set
free
,
*NL*
As
o'er
the
Stygian
lake
it
floats
along
,
*NL*
Thy
praises
singing
still
shall
hold
its
way
,
*NL*
And
make
the
waters
of
oblivion
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
one
of
the
two
that
looked
like
kings
exclaimed
,
``
Enough
,
*NL*
enough
,
divine
singer
!
It
would
be
an
endless
task
to
put
before
us
now
*NL*
the
death
and
the
charms
of
the
peerless
Altisidora
,
not
dead
as
the
*NL*
ignorant
world
imagines
,
but
living
in
the
voice
of
fame
and
in
the
*NL*
penance
which
Sancho
Panza
,
here
present
,
has
to
undergo
to
restore
her
*NL*
to
the
long-lost
light
.
Do
thou
,
therefore
,
O
Rhadamanthus
,
who
sittest
*NL*
in
judgment
with
me
in
the
murky
caverns
of
Dis
,
as
thou
knowest
all
that
*NL*
the
inscrutable
fates
have
decreed
touching
the
resuscitation
of
this
*NL*
damsel
,
announce
and
declare
it
at
once
,
that
the
happiness
we
look
*NL*
forward
to
from
her
restoration
be
no
longer
deferred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
Minos
the
fellow
judge
of
Rhadamanthus
said
this
,
than
*NL*
Rhadamanthus
rising
up
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
,
officials
of
this
house
,
high
and
low
,
great
and
small
,
make
haste
*NL*
hither
one
and
all
,
and
print
on
Sancho
's
face
four-and-twenty
smacks
,
*NL*
and
give
him
twelve
pinches
and
six
pin
thrusts
in
the
back
and
arms
;
for
*NL*
upon
this
ceremony
depends
the
restoration
of
Altisidora
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
Sancho
broke
silence
and
cried
out
,
``
By
all
that
's
good
,
*NL*
I
'll
as
soon
let
my
face
be
smacked
or
handled
as
turn
Moor
.
Body
o

me
!
*NL*
What
has
handling
my
face
got
to
do
with
the
resurrection
of
this
damsel
?
*NL*
`
The
old
woman
took
kindly
to
the
blits
;
they
enchant
Dulcinea
,
and
whip
*NL*
me
in
order
to
disenchant
her
;
Altisidora
dies
of
ailments
God
was
*NL*
pleased
to
send
her
,
and
to
bring
her
to
life
again
they
must
give
me
*NL*
four-and-twenty
smacks
,
and
prick
holes
in
my
body
with
pins
,
and
raise
*NL*
weals
on
my
arms
with
pinches
!
Try
those
jokes
on
a
brother-in-law
;
`
I
'm
*NL*
an
old
dog
,
and
``
tus
,
tus
''
is
no
use
with
me
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
shalt
die
,
''
said
Rhadamanthus
in
a
loud
voice
;
``
relent
,
thou
tiger
;
*NL*
humble
thyself
,
proud
Nimrod
;
suffer
and
be
silent
,
for
no
*NL*
impossibilities
are
asked
of
thee
;
it
is
not
for
thee
to
inquire
into
the
*NL*
difficulties
in
this
matter
;
smacked
thou
must
be
,
pricked
thou
shalt
see
*NL*
thyself
,
and
with
pinches
thou
must
be
made
to
howl
.
Ho
,
I
say
,
*NL*
officials
,
obey
my
orders
;
or
by
the
word
of
an
honest
man
,
ye
shall
see
*NL*
what
ye
were
born
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
some
six
duennas
,
advancing
across
the
court
,
made
their
*NL*
appearance
in
procession
,
one
after
the
other
,
four
of
them
with
*NL*
spectacles
,
and
all
with
their
right
hands
uplifted
,
showing
four
fingers
*NL*
of
wrist
to
make
their
hands
look
longer
,
as
is
the
fashion
now-a-days
.
*NL*
No
sooner
had
Sancho
caught
sight
of
them
than
,
bellowing
like
a
bull
,
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
I
might
let
myself
be
handled
by
all
the
world
;
but
allow
*NL*
duennas
to
touch
me
--
not
a
bit
of
it
!
Scratch
my
face
,
as
my
master
was
*NL*
served
in
this
very
castle
;
run
me
through
the
body
with
burnished
*NL*
daggers
;
pinch
my
arms
with
red-hot
pincers
;
I
'll
bear
all
in
patience
to
*NL*
serve
these
gentlefolk
;
but
I
wo
n't
let
duennas
touch
me
,
though
the
*NL*
devil
should
carry
me
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Don
Quixote
,
too
,
broke
silence
,
saying
to
Sancho
,
``
Have
patience
,
*NL*
my
son
,
and
gratify
these
noble
persons
,
and
give
all
thanks
to
heaven
*NL*
that
it
has
infused
such
virtue
into
thy
person
,
that
by
its
sufferings
*NL*
thou
canst
disenchant
the
enchanted
and
restore
to
life
the
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duennas
were
now
close
to
Sancho
,
and
he
,
having
become
more
*NL*
tractable
and
reasonable
,
settling
himself
well
in
his
chair
presented
*NL*
his
face
and
beard
to
the
first
,
who
delivered
him
a
smack
very
stoutly
*NL*
laid
on
,
and
then
made
him
a
low
curtsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Less
politeness
and
less
paint
,
senora
duenna
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
by
God
*NL*
your
hands
smell
of
vinegar-wash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fine
,
all
the
duennas
smacked
him
and
several
others
of
the
household
*NL*
pinched
him
;
but
what
he
could
not
stand
was
being
pricked
by
the
pins
;
*NL*
and
so
,
apparently
out
of
patience
,
he
started
up
out
of
his
chair
,
and
*NL*
seizing
a
lighted
torch
that
stood
near
him
fell
upon
the
duennas
and
the
*NL*
whole
set
of
his
tormentors
,
exclaiming
,
``
Begone
,
ye
ministers
of
hell
;
*NL*
I
'm
not
made
of
brass
not
to
feel
such
out-of-the-way
tortures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
Altisidora
,
who
probably
was
tired
of
having
been
so
long
*NL*
lying
on
her
back
,
turned
on
her
side
;
seeing
which
the
bystanders
cried
*NL*
out
almost
with
one
voice
,
``
Altisidora
is
alive
!
Altisidora
lives
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rhadamanthus
bade
Sancho
put
away
his
wrath
,
as
the
object
they
had
in
*NL*
view
was
now
attained
.
When
Don
Quixote
saw
Altisidora
move
,
he
went
on
*NL*
his
knees
to
Sancho
saying
to
him
,
``
Now
is
the
time
,
son
of
my
bowels
,
*NL*
not
to
call
thee
my
squire
,
for
thee
to
give
thyself
some
of
those
lashes
*NL*
thou
art
bound
to
lay
on
for
the
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
.
Now
,
I
say
,
*NL*
is
the
time
when
the
virtue
that
is
in
thee
is
ripe
,
and
endowed
with
*NL*
efficacy
to
work
the
good
that
is
looked
for
from
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Sancho
made
answer
,
``
That
's
trick
upon
trick
,
I
think
,
and
not
*NL*
honey
upon
pancakes
;
a
nice
thing
it
would
be
for
a
whipping
to
come
now
,
*NL*
on
the
top
of
pinches
,
smacks
,
and
pin-proddings
!
You
had
better
take
a
*NL*
big
stone
and
tie
it
round
my
neck
,
and
pitch
me
into
a
well
;
I
should
*NL*
not
mind
it
much
,
if
I
'm
to
be
always
made
the
cow
of
the
wedding
for
the
*NL*
cure
of
other
people
's
ailments
.
Leave
me
alone
;
or
else
by
God
I
'll
*NL*
fling
the
whole
thing
to
the
dogs
,
let
come
what
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Altisidora
had
by
this
time
sat
up
on
the
catafalque
,
and
as
she
did
so
*NL*
the
clarions
sounded
,
accompanied
by
the
flutes
,
and
the
voices
of
all
*NL*
present
exclaiming
,
``
Long
life
to
Altisidora
!
long
life
to
Altisidora
!
''
*NL*
The
duke
and
duchess
and
the
kings
Minos
and
Rhadamanthus
stood
up
,
and
*NL*
all
,
together
with
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
,
advanced
to
receive
her
and
*NL*
take
her
down
from
the
catafalque
;
and
she
,
making
as
though
she
were
*NL*
recovering
from
a
swoon
,
bowed
her
head
to
the
duke
and
duchess
and
to
*NL*
the
kings
,
and
looking
sideways
at
Don
Quixote
,
said
to
him
,
``
God
forgive
*NL*
thee
,
insensible
knight
,
for
through
thy
cruelty
I
have
been
,
to
me
it
*NL*
seems
,
more
than
a
thousand
years
in
the
other
world
;
and
to
thee
,
the
*NL*
most
compassionate
upon
earth
,
I
render
thanks
for
the
life
I
am
now
in
*NL*
possession
of
.
From
this
day
forth
,
friend
Sancho
,
count
as
thine
six
*NL*
smocks
of
mine
which
I
bestow
upon
thee
,
to
make
as
many
shirts
for
*NL*
thyself
,
and
if
they
are
not
all
quite
whole
,
at
any
rate
they
are
all
*NL*
clean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
kissed
her
hands
in
gratitude
,
kneeling
,
and
with
the
mitre
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
The
duke
bade
them
take
it
from
him
,
and
give
him
back
his
cap
and
*NL*
doublet
and
remove
the
flaming
robe
.
Sancho
begged
the
duke
to
let
them
*NL*
leave
him
the
robe
and
mitre
;
as
he
wanted
to
take
them
home
for
a
token
*NL*
and
memento
of
that
unexampled
adventure
.
The
duchess
said
they
must
*NL*
leave
them
with
him
;
for
he
knew
already
what
a
great
friend
of
his
she
*NL*
was
.
The
duke
then
gave
orders
that
the
court
should
be
cleared
,
and
that
*NL*
all
should
retire
to
their
chambers
,
and
that
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
*NL*
should
be
conducted
to
their
old
quarters

CHAPTER
LXX
.
*NL*
*NL*
WHICH
FOLLOWS
SIXTY-NINE
AND
DEALS
WITH
MATTERS
INDISPENSABLE
FOR
THE
*NL*
CLEAR
COMPREHENSION
OF
THIS
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
slept
that
night
in
a
cot
in
the
same
chamber
with
Don
Quixote
,
a
*NL*
thing
he
would
have
gladly
excused
if
he
could
for
he
knew
very
well
that
*NL*
with
questions
and
answers
his
master
would
not
let
him
sleep
,
and
he
was
*NL*
in
no
humour
for
talking
much
,
as
he
still
felt
the
pain
of
his
late
*NL*
martyrdom
,
which
interfered
with
his
freedom
of
speech
;
and
it
would
have
*NL*
been
more
to
his
taste
to
sleep
in
a
hovel
alone
,
than
in
that
luxurious
*NL*
chamber
in
company
.
And
so
well
founded
did
his
apprehension
prove
,
and
*NL*
so
correct
was
his
anticipation
,
that
scarcely
had
his
master
got
into
*NL*
bed
when
he
said
,
``
What
dost
thou
think
of
tonight
's
adventure
,
Sancho
?
*NL*
Great
and
mighty
is
the
power
of
cold-hearted
scorn
,
for
thou
with
thine
*NL*
own
eyes
hast
seen
Altisidora
slain
,
not
by
arrows
,
nor
by
the
sword
,
nor
*NL*
by
any
warlike
weapon
,
nor
by
deadly
poisons
,
but
by
the
thought
of
the
*NL*
sternness
and
scorn
with
which
I
have
always
treated
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
might
have
died
and
welcome
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
when
she
pleased
and
how
*NL*
she
pleased
;
and
she
might
have
left
me
alone
,
for
I
never
made
her
fall
*NL*
in
love
or
scorned
her
.
I
do
n't
know
nor
can
I
imagine
how
the
recovery
*NL*
of
Altisidora
,
a
damsel
more
fanciful
than
wise
,
can
have
,
as
I
have
said
*NL*
before
,
anything
to
do
with
the
sufferings
of
Sancho
Panza
.
Now
I
begin
*NL*
to
see
plainly
and
clearly
that
there
are
enchanters
and
enchanted
people
*NL*
in
the
world
;
and
may
God
deliver
me
from
them
,
since
I
ca
n't
deliver
*NL*
myself
;
and
so
I
beg
of
your
worship
to
let
me
sleep
and
not
ask
me
any
*NL*
more
questions
,
unless
you
want
me
to
throw
myself
out
of
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sleep
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
if
the
pinprodding
and
*NL*
pinches
thou
hast
received
and
the
smacks
administered
to
thee
will
let
*NL*
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
pain
came
up
to
the
insult
of
the
smacks
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
the
*NL*
simple
reason
that
it
was
duennas
,
confound
them
,
that
gave
them
to
me
;
*NL*
but
once
more
I
entreat
your
worship
to
let
me
sleep
,
for
sleep
is
relief
*NL*
from
misery
to
those
who
are
miserable
when
awake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
it
so
,
and
God
be
with
thee
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
fell
asleep
,
both
of
them
,
and
Cide
Hamete
,
the
author
of
this
great
*NL*
history
,
took
this
opportunity
to
record
and
relate
what
it
was
that
*NL*
induced
the
duke
and
duchess
to
get
up
the
elaborate
plot
that
has
been
*NL*
described
.
The
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
,
he
says
,
not
forgetting
how
he
*NL*
as
the
Knight
of
the
Mirrors
had
been
vanquished
and
overthrown
by
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
which
defeat
and
overthrow
upset
all
his
plans
,
resolved
to
try
*NL*
his
hand
again
,
hoping
for
better
luck
than
he
had
before
;
and
so
,
having
*NL*
learned
where
Don
Quixote
was
from
the
page
who
brought
the
letter
and
*NL*
present
to
Sancho
's
wife
,
Teresa
Panza
,
he
got
himself
new
armour
and
*NL*
another
horse
,
and
put
a
white
moon
upon
his
shield
,
and
to
carry
his
*NL*
arms
he
had
a
mule
led
by
a
peasant
,
not
by
Tom
Cecial
his
former
squire
*NL*
for
fear
he
should
be
recognised
by
Sancho
or
Don
Quixote
.
He
came
to
the
*NL*
duke
's
castle
,
and
the
duke
informed
him
of
the
road
and
route
Don
*NL*
Quixote
had
taken
with
the
intention
of
being
present
at
the
jousts
at
*NL*
Saragossa
.
He
told
him
,
too
,
of
the
jokes
he
had
practised
upon
him
,
and
*NL*
of
the
device
for
the
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
at
the
expense
of
*NL*
Sancho
's
backside
;
and
finally
he
gave
him
an
account
of
the
trick
Sancho
*NL*
had
played
upon
his
master
,
making
him
believe
that
Dulcinea
was
*NL*
enchanted
and
turned
into
a
country
wench
;
and
of
how
the
duchess
,
his
*NL*
wife
,
had
persuaded
Sancho
that
it
was
he
himself
who
was
deceived
,
*NL*
inasmuch
as
Dulcinea
was
really
enchanted
;
at
which
the
bachelor
laughed
*NL*
not
a
little
,
and
marvelled
as
well
at
the
sharpness
and
simplicity
of
*NL*
Sancho
as
at
the
length
to
which
Don
Quixote
's
madness
went
.
The
duke
*NL*
begged
of
him
if
he
found
him
-LRB-
whether
he
overcame
him
or
not
-RRB-
to
return
*NL*
that
way
and
let
him
know
the
result
.
This
the
bachelor
did
;
he
set
out
*NL*
in
quest
of
Don
Quixote
,
and
not
finding
him
at
Saragossa
,
he
went
on
,
*NL*
and
how
he
fared
has
been
already
told
.
He
returned
to
the
duke
's
castle
*NL*
and
told
him
all
,
what
the
conditions
of
the
combat
were
,
and
how
Don
*NL*
Quixote
was
now
,
like
a
loyal
knight-errant
,
returning
to
keep
his
*NL*
promise
of
retiring
to
his
village
for
a
year
,
by
which
time
,
said
the
*NL*
bachelor
,
he
might
perhaps
be
cured
of
his
madness
;
for
that
was
the
*NL*
object
that
had
led
him
to
adopt
these
disguises
,
as
it
was
a
sad
thing
*NL*
for
a
gentleman
of
such
good
parts
as
Don
Quixote
to
be
a
madman
.
And
so
*NL*
he
took
his
leave
of
the
duke
,
and
went
home
to
his
village
to
wait
there
*NL*
for
Don
Quixote
,
who
was
coming
after
him
.
Thereupon
the
duke
seized
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
practising
this
mystification
upon
him
;
so
much
did
he
*NL*
enjoy
everything
connected
with
Sancho
and
Don
Quixote
.
He
had
the
roads
*NL*
about
the
castle
far
and
near
,
everywhere
he
thought
Don
Quixote
was
*NL*
likely
to
pass
on
his
return
,
occupied
by
large
numbers
of
his
servants
*NL*
on
foot
and
on
horseback
,
who
were
to
bring
him
to
the
castle
,
by
fair
*NL*
means
or
foul
,
if
they
met
him
.
They
did
meet
him
,
and
sent
word
to
the
*NL*
duke
,
who
,
having
already
settled
what
was
to
be
done
,
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
heard
of
his
arrival
,
ordered
the
torches
and
lamps
in
the
court
to
be
*NL*
lit
and
Altisidora
to
be
placed
on
the
catafalque
with
all
the
pomp
and
*NL*
ceremony
that
has
been
described
,
the
whole
affair
being
so
well
arranged
*NL*
and
acted
that
it
differed
but
little
from
reality
.
And
Cide
Hamete
says
,
*NL*
moreover
,
that
for
his
part
he
considers
the
concocters
of
the
joke
as
*NL*
crazy
as
the
victims
of
it
,
and
that
the
duke
and
duchess
were
not
two
*NL*
fingers
'
breadth
removed
from
being
something
like
fools
themselves
when
*NL*
they
took
such
pains
to
make
game
of
a
pair
of
fools
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
latter
,
one
was
sleeping
soundly
and
the
other
lying
awake
*NL*
occupied
with
his
desultory
thoughts
,
when
daylight
came
to
them
bringing
*NL*
with
it
the
desire
to
rise
;
for
the
lazy
down
was
never
a
delight
to
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
victor
or
vanquished
.
Altisidora
,
come
back
from
death
to
life
*NL*
as
Don
Quixote
fancied
,
following
up
the
freak
of
her
lord
and
lady
,
*NL*
entered
the
chamber
,
crowned
with
the
garland
she
had
worn
on
the
*NL*
catafalque
and
in
a
robe
of
white
taffeta
embroidered
with
gold
flowers
,
*NL*
her
hair
flowing
loose
over
her
shoulders
,
and
leaning
upon
a
staff
of
*NL*
fine
black
ebony
.
Don
Quixote
,
disconcerted
and
in
confusion
at
her
*NL*
appearance
,
huddled
himself
up
and
well-nigh
covered
himself
altogether
*NL*
with
the
sheets
and
counterpane
of
the
bed
,
tongue-tied
,
and
unable
to
*NL*
offer
her
any
civility
.
Altisidora
seated
herself
on
a
chair
at
the
head
*NL*
of
the
bed
,
and
,
after
a
deep
sigh
,
said
to
him
in
a
feeble
,
soft
voice
,
*NL*
``
When
women
of
rank
and
modest
maidens
trample
honour
under
foot
,
and
*NL*
give
a
loose
to
the
tongue
that
breaks
through
every
impediment
,
*NL*
publishing
abroad
the
inmost
secrets
of
their
hearts
,
they
are
reduced
to
*NL*
sore
extremities
.
Such
a
one
am
I
,
Senor
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
*NL*
crushed
,
conquered
,
love-smitten
,
but
yet
patient
under
suffering
and
*NL*
virtuous
,
and
so
much
so
that
my
heart
broke
with
grief
and
I
lost
my
*NL*
life
.
For
the
last
two
days
I
have
been
dead
,
slain
by
the
thought
of
the
*NL*
cruelty
with
which
thou
hast
treated
me
,
obdurate
knight
,
*NL*
*NL*
O
harder
thou
than
marble
to
my
plaint
;
*NL*
*NL*
or
at
least
believed
to
be
dead
by
all
who
saw
me
;
and
had
it
not
been
*NL*
that
Love
,
taking
pity
on
me
,
let
my
recovery
rest
upon
the
sufferings
of
*NL*
this
good
squire
,
there
I
should
have
remained
in
the
other
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
might
very
well
have
let
it
rest
upon
the
sufferings
of
my
ass
,
and
*NL*
I
should
have
been
obliged
to
him
,
''
said
Sancho
.
``
But
tell
me
,
*NL*
senora
--
and
may
heaven
send
you
a
tenderer
lover
than
my
master-what
did
*NL*
you
see
in
the
other
world
?
What
goes
on
in
hell
?
For
of
course
that
's
*NL*
where
one
who
dies
in
despair
is
bound
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
''
said
Altisidora
,
``
I
can
not
have
died
outright
,
*NL*
for
I
did
not
go
into
hell
;
had
I
gone
in
,
it
is
very
certain
I
should
*NL*
never
have
come
out
again
,
do
what
I
might
.
The
truth
is
,
I
came
to
the
*NL*
gate
,
where
some
dozen
or
so
of
devils
were
playing
tennis
,
all
in
*NL*
breeches
and
doublets
,
with
falling
collars
trimmed
with
Flemish
*NL*
bonelace
,
and
ruffles
of
the
same
that
served
them
for
wristbands
,
with
*NL*
four
fingers
'
breadth
of
the
arms
exposed
to
make
their
hands
look
*NL*
longer
;
in
their
hands
they
held
rackets
of
fire
;
but
what
amazed
me
*NL*
still
more
was
that
books
,
apparently
full
of
wind
and
rubbish
,
served
*NL*
them
for
tennis
balls
,
a
strange
and
marvellous
thing
;
this
,
however
,
did
*NL*
not
astonish
me
so
much
as
to
observe
that
,
although
with
players
it
is
*NL*
usual
for
the
winners
to
be
glad
and
the
losers
sorry
,
there
in
that
game
*NL*
all
were
growling
,
all
were
snarling
,
and
all
were
cursing
one
another
.
''
*NL*
``
That
's
no
wonder
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
devils
,
whether
playing
or
not
,
can
*NL*
never
be
content
,
win
or
lose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
said
Altisidora
;
``
but
there
is
another
thing
that
*NL*
surprises
me
too
,
I
mean
surprised
me
then
,
and
that
was
that
no
ball
*NL*
outlasted
the
first
throw
or
was
of
any
use
a
second
time
;
and
it
was
*NL*
wonderful
the
constant
succession
there
was
of
books
,
new
and
old
.
To
one
*NL*
of
them
,
a
brand-new
,
well-bound
one
,
they
gave
such
a
stroke
that
they
*NL*
knocked
the
guts
out
of
it
and
scattered
the
leaves
about
.
`
Look
what
*NL*
book
that
is
,
'
said
one
devil
to
another
,
and
the
other
replied
,
`
It
is
*NL*
the
``
Second
Part
of
the
History
of
Don
Quixote
of
La

,
''
not
by
Cide
*NL*
Hamete
,
the
original
author
,
but
by
an
Aragonese
who
by
his
own
account
*NL*
is
of
Tordesillas
.
'
`
Out
of
this
with
it
,

said
the
first

into
the
*NL*
depths
of
hell
with
it
out
of
my
sight

'
`
Is
it
so
bad
?

said
the
other
.
*NL*
`
So
bad
is
it

said
the
first
,
`
that
if
I
had
set
myself
deliberately
to
*NL*
make
a
worse
,
I
could
not
have
done
it
.
'
They
then
went
on
with
their
*NL*
game
,
knocking
other
books
about
;
and
I
,
having
heard
them
mention
the
*NL*
name
of
Don
Quixote
whom
I
love
and
adore
so
,
took
care
to
retain
this
*NL*
vision
in
my
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
vision
it
must
have
been
,
no
doubt
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
there
is
*NL*
no
other
I
in
the
world
;
this
history
has
been
going
about
here
for
some
*NL*
time
from
hand
to
hand
,
but
it
does
not
stay
long
in
any
,
for
everybody
*NL*
gives
it
a
taste
of
his
foot
.
I
am
not
disturbed
by
hearing
that
I
am
*NL*
wandering
in
a
fantastic
shape
in
the
darkness
of
the
pit
or
in
the
*NL*
daylight
above
,
for
I
am
not
the
one
that
history
treats
of
.
If
it
should
*NL*
be
good
,
faithful
,
and
true
,
it
will
have
ages
of
life
;
but
if
it
should
*NL*
be
bad
,
from
its
birth
to
its
burial
will
not
be
a
very
long
journey

''
*NL*
*NL*
Altisidora
was
about
to
proceed
with
her
complaint
against
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
when
he
said
to
her
,
``
I
have
several
times
told
you
,
senora
that
it
*NL*
grieves
me
you
should
have
set
your
affections
upon
me
,
as
from
mine
they
*NL*
can
only
receive
gratitude
,
but
no
return
.
I
was
born
to
belong
to
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
and
the
fates
,
if
there
are
any
,
dedicated
me
to
*NL*
her
;
and
to
suppose
that
any
other
beauty
can
take
the
place
she
occupies
*NL*
in
my
heart
is
to
suppose
an
impossibility
.
This
frank
declaration
should
*NL*
suffice
to
make
you
retire
within
the
bounds
of
your
modesty
,
for
no
one
*NL*
can
bind
himself
to
do
impossibilities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
this
,
Altisidora
,
with
a
show
of
anger
and
agitation
,
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
God
's
life

Don
Stockfish

soul

stone
of
a
date

more
*NL*
obstinate
and
obdurate
than
a
clown
asked
a
favour
when
he
has
his
mind
*NL*
made
up
,
if
I
fall
upon
you
I
'll
tear
your
eyes
out
!
Do
you
fancy

Don
*NL*
Vanquished

Don
Cudgelled
,
that
I
died
for
your
sake

All
that
you
have

seen
to-night
has
been
make-believe
;
I
'm
not
the
woman
to
let
the
black
*NL*
of
my
nail
suffer
for
such
a
camel
,
much
less
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
well
believe
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
for
all
that
about
lovers
pining
*NL*
to
death
is
absurd

for
doing
it-Judas

*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
talking
,
the
musician
,
singer
,
and
poet
,
who
had
sung
the
*NL*
two
stanzas
given
above
came
in
,
and
making
a
profound
obeisance
to
Don
*NL*
Quixote
said
,

Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
``
so
that
my
courtesy
may
be
answerable
to
your
deserts
?
''
The
*NL*
young
man
replied
that
he
was
the
musician
and
songster
of
the
night
*NL*
before
.
``
Of
a
truth
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
your
worship
has
a
most
*NL*
excellent
voice
;
but
what
you
sang
did
not
seem
to
me
very
much
to
the
*NL*
purpose
;
for
what
have
Garcilasso
's
stanzas
to
do
with
the
death
of
this
*NL*
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
surprised
at
that
,
''
returned
the
musician
;
``
for
with
the
callow
*NL*
poets
of
our
day
the
way
is
for
every
one
to
write
as
he
pleases
and
*NL*
pilfer
where
he
chooses
,
whether
it
be
germane
to
the
matter
or
not
,
and
*NL*
now-a-days
there
is
no
piece
of
silliness
they
can
sing
or
write
that
is
*NL*
not
set
down
to
poetic
licence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
was
about
to
reply
,
but
was
prevented
by
the
duke
and
*NL*
duchess
,
who
came
in
to
see
him
,
and
with
them
there
followed
a
long
and
*NL*
delightful
conversation
,
in
the
course
of
which
Sancho
said
so
many
droll
*NL*
and
saucy
things
that
he
left
the
duke
and
duchess
wondering
not
only
at
*NL*
his
simplicity
but
at
his
sharpness
.
Don
Quixote
begged
their
permission
*NL*
to
take
his
departure
that
same
day
,
inasmuch
as
for
a
vanquished
knight
*NL*
like
himself
it
was
fitter
he
should
live
in
a
pig-sty
than
in
a
royal
*NL*
palace
.
They
gave
it
very
readily
,
and
the
duchess
asked
him
if
*NL*
Altisidora
was
in
his
good
graces
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
``
Senora
,
let
me
tell
your
ladyship
that
this
damsel
's
ailment
*NL*
comes
entirely
of
idleness
,
and
the
cure
for
it
is
honest
and
constant
*NL*
employment
.
She
herself
has
told
me
that
lace
is
worn
in
hell
;
and
as
she
*NL*
must
know
how
to
make
it
,
let
it
never
be
out
of
her
hands
;
for
when
she
*NL*
is
occupied
in
shifting
the
bobbins
to
and
fro
,
the
image
or
images
of
*NL*
what
she
loves
will
not
shift
to
and
fro
in
her
thoughts
;
this
is
the
*NL*
truth
,
this
is
my
opinion
,
and
this
is
my
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
mine
,
''
added
Sancho
;
``
for
I
never
in
all
my
life
saw
a
lace-maker
*NL*
that
died
for
love
;
when
damsels
are
at
work
their
minds
are
more
set
on
*NL*
finishing
their
tasks
than
on
thinking
of
their
loves
.
I
speak
from
my
*NL*
own
experience
;
for
when
I
'm
digging
I
never
think
of
my
old
woman
;
I
*NL*
mean
my
Teresa
Panza
,
whom
I
love
better
than
my
own
eyelids
.
''
``
You
say
*NL*
well
,
Sancho
,
''
said
the
duchess
,
``
and
I
will
take
care
that
my
Altisidora
*NL*
employs
herself
henceforward
in
needlework
of
some
sort
;
for
she
is
*NL*
extremely
expert
at
it
.
''
``
There
is
no
occasion
to
have
recourse
to
that
*NL*
remedy
,
senora
,
''
said
Altisidora
;
``
for
the
mere
thought
of
the
cruelty
*NL*
with
which
this
vagabond
villain
has
treated
me
will
suffice
to
blot
him
*NL*
out
of
my
memory
without
any
other
device
;
with
your
highness
's
leave
I
*NL*
will
retire
,
not
to
have
before
my
eyes
,
I
wo
n't
say
his
rueful
*NL*
countenance
,
but
his
abominable
,
ugly
looks
.
''
``
That
reminds
me
of
the
*NL*
common
saying
,
that
`
he
that
rails
is
ready
to
forgive
,
'
''
said
the
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Altisidora
then
,
pretending
to
wipe
away
her
tears
with
a
handkerchief
,
*NL*
made
an
obeisance
to
her
master
and
mistress
and
quitted
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ill
luck
betide
thee
,
poor
damsel
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
ill
luck
betide
thee
!
*NL*
Thou
hast
fallen
in
with
a
soul
as
dry
as
a
rush
and
a
heart
as
hard
as
*NL*
oak
;
had
it
been
me
,
i
`
faith
`
another
cock
would
have
crowed
to
thee
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
,
and
Don
Quixote
dressed
himself
and
*NL*
dined
with
the
duke
and
duchess
,
and
set
out
the
same
evening

CHAPTER
LXXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
WHAT
PASSED
BETWEEN
DON
QUIXOTE
AND
HIS
SQUIRE
SANCHO
ON
THE
WAY
TO
*NL*
THEIR
VILLAGE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
vanquished
and
afflicted
Don
Quixote
went
along
very
downcast
in
one
*NL*
respect
and
very
happy
in
another
.
His
sadness
arose
from
his
defeat
,
and
*NL*
his
satisfaction
from
the
thought
of
the
virtue
that
lay
in
Sancho
,
as
*NL*
had
been
proved
by
the
resurrection
of
Altisidora
;
though
it
was
with
*NL*
difficulty
he
could
persuade
himself
that
the
love-smitten
damsel
had
*NL*
been
really
dead
.
Sancho
went
along
anything
but
cheerful
,
for
it
grieved
*NL*
him
that
Altisidora
had
not
kept
her
promise
of
giving
him
the
smocks
;
*NL*
and
turning
this
over
in
his
mind
he
said
to
his
master
,
``
Surely
,
senor
,
*NL*
I
'm
the
most
unlucky
doctor
in
the
world
;
there
's
many
a
physician
that
,
*NL*
after
killing
the
sick
man
he
had
to
cure
,
requires
to
be
paid
for
his
*NL*
work
,
though
it
is
only
signing
a
bit
of
a
list
of
medicines
,
that
the
*NL*
apothecary
and
not
he
makes
up
,
and
,
there
,
his
labour
is
over
;
but
with
*NL*
me
though
to
cure
somebody
else
costs
me
drops
of
blood
,
smacks
,
pinches
,
*NL*
pinproddings
,
and
whippings
,
nobody
gives
me
a
farthing
.
Well
,
I
swear
by
*NL*
all
that
's
good
if
they
put
another
patient
into
my
hands
,
they
'll
have
*NL*
to
grease
them
for
me
before
I
cure
him
;
for
,
as
they
say
,
`
it
's
by
his
*NL*
singing
the
abbot
gets
his
dinner
,
'
and
I
'm
not
going
to
believe
that
*NL*
heaven
has
bestowed
upon
me
the
virtue
I
have
,
that
I
should
be
dealing
*NL*
it
out
to
others
all
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
right
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
and
Altisidora
has
*NL*
behaved
very
badly
in
not
giving
thee
the
smocks
she
promised
;
and
*NL*
although
that
virtue
of
thine
is
gratis
data
--
as
it
has
cost
thee
no
*NL*
study
whatever
,
any
more
than
such
study
as
thy
personal
sufferings
may
*NL*
be
--
I
can
say
for
myself
that
if
thou
wouldst
have
payment
for
the
lashes
*NL*
on
account
of
the
disenchant
of
Dulcinea
,
I
would
have
given
it
to
thee
*NL*
freely
ere
this
.
I
am
not
sure
,
however
,
whether
payment
will
comport
*NL*
with
the
cure
,
and
I
would
not
have
the
reward
interfere
with
the
*NL*
medicine
.
I
think
there
will
be
nothing
lost
by
trying
it
;
consider
how
*NL*
much
thou
wouldst
have
,
Sancho
,
and
whip
thyself
at
once
,
and
pay
thyself
*NL*
down
with
thine
own
hand
,
as
thou
hast
money
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
proposal
Sancho
opened
his
eyes
and
his
ears
a
palm
's
breadth
*NL*
wide
,
and
in
his
heart
very
readily
acquiesced
in
whipping
himself
,
and
*NL*
said
he
to
his
master
,
``
Very
well
then
,
senor
,
I
'll
hold
myself
in
*NL*
readiness
to
gratify
your
worship
's
wishes
if
I
'm
to
profit
by
it
;
for
*NL*
the
love
of
my
wife
and
children
forces
me
to
seem
grasping
.
Let
your
*NL*
worship
say
how
much
you
will
pay
me
for
each
lash
I
give
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Sancho
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
,
``
I
were
to
requite
thee
as
the
*NL*
importance
and
nature
of
the
cure
deserves
,
the
treasures
of
Venice
,
the
*NL*
mines
of
Potosi
,
would
be
insufficient
to
pay
thee
.
See
what
thou
hast
of
*NL*
mine
,
and
put
a
price
on
each
lash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
them
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
there
are
three
thousand
three
hundred
and
odd
;
*NL*
of
these
I
have
given
myself
five
,
the
rest
remain
;
let
the
five
go
for
*NL*
the
odd
ones
,
and
let
us
take
the
three
thousand
three
hundred
,
which
at
*NL*
a
quarter
real
apiece
-LRB-
for
I
will
not
take
less
though
the
whole
world
*NL*
should
bid
me
-RRB-
make
three
thousand
three
hundred
quarter
reals
;
the
three
*NL*
thousand
are
one
thousand
five
hundred
half
reals
,
which
make
seven
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
reals
;
and
the
three
hundred
make
a
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
half
reals
,
which
come
to
seventy-five
reals
,
which
added
to
the
seven
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
make
eight
hundred
and
twenty-five
reals
in
all
.
These
*NL*
I
will
stop
out
of
what
I
have
belonging
to
your
worship
,
and
I
'll
return
*NL*
home
rich
and
content
,
though
well
whipped
,
for
`
there
's
no
taking
*NL*
trout
'
--
but
I
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
blessed
Sancho
!
O
dear
Sancho
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
how
we
shall
be
*NL*
bound
to
serve
thee
,
Dulcinea
and
I
,
all
the
days
of
our
lives
that
*NL*
heaven
may
grant
us
!
If
she
returns
to
her
lost
shape
-LRB-
and
it
can
not
be
*NL*
but
that
she
will
-RRB-
her
misfortune
will
have
been
good
fortune
,
and
my
*NL*
defeat
a
most
happy
triumph
.
But
look
here
,
Sancho
;
when
wilt
thou
begin
*NL*
the
scourging
?
For
if
thou
wilt
make
short
work
of
it
,
I
will
give
thee
a
*NL*
hundred
reals
over
and
above
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
said
Sancho
;
``
this
night
without
fail
.
Let
your
worship
order
it
*NL*
so
that
we
pass
it
out
of
doors
and
in
the
open
air
,
and
I
'll
scarify
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Night
,
longed
for
by
Don
Quixote
with
the
greatest
anxiety
in
the
world
,
*NL*
came
at
last
,
though
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
wheels
of
Apollo
's
car
had
*NL*
broken
down
,
and
that
the
day
was
drawing
itself
out
longer
than
usual
,
*NL*
just
as
is
the
case
with
lovers
,
who
never
make
the
reckoning
of
their
*NL*
desires
agree
with
time
.
They
made
their
way
at
length
in
among
some
*NL*
pleasant
trees
that
stood
a
little
distance
from
the
road
,
and
there
*NL*
vacating
Rocinante
's
saddle
and
Dapple
's
pack-saddle
,
they
stretched
*NL*
themselves
on
the
green
grass
and
made
their
supper
off
Sancho
's
stores
,
*NL*
and
he
making
a
powerful
and
flexible
whip
out
of
Dapple
's
halter
and
*NL*
headstall
retreated
about
twenty
paces
from
his
master
among
some
beech
*NL*
trees
.
Don
Quixote
seeing
him
march
off
with
such
resolution
and
spirit
,
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
Take
care
,
my
friend
,
not
to
cut
thyself
to
pieces
;
allow
*NL*
the
lashes
to
wait
for
one
another
,
and
do
not
be
in
so
great
a
hurry
as
*NL*
to
run
thyself
out
of
breath
midway
;
I
mean
,
do
not
lay
on
so
strenuously
*NL*
as
to
make
thy
life
fail
thee
before
thou
hast
reached
the
desired
*NL*
number
;
and
that
thou
mayest
not
lose
by
a
card
too
much
or
too
little
,
I
*NL*
will
station
myself
apart
and
count
on
my
rosary
here
the
lashes
thou
*NL*
givest
thyself
.
May
heaven
help
thee
as
thy
good
intention
deserves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Pledges
do
n't
distress
a
good
payer
,
'
''
said
Sancho
;
``
I
mean
to
lay
on
*NL*
in
such
a
way
as
without
killing
myself
to
hurt
myself
,
for
in
that
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
lies
the
essence
of
this
miracle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
stripped
himself
from
the
waist
upwards
,
and
snatching
up
the
*NL*
rope
he
began
to
lay
on
and
Don
Quixote
to
count
the
lashes
.
He
might
*NL*
have
given
himself
six
or
eight
when
he
began
to
think
the
joke
no
*NL*
trifle
,
and
its
price
very
low
;
and
holding
his
hand
for
a
moment
,
he
*NL*
told
his
master
that
he
cried
off
on
the
score
of
a
blind
bargain
,
for
*NL*
each
of
those
lashes
ought
to
be
paid
for
at
the
rate
of
half
a
real
*NL*
instead
of
a
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
and
be
not
disheartened
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
``
for
I
double
the
stakes
as
to
price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
in
God
's
hand
be
it
,
and
let
it
rain
*NL*
lashes
.
''
But
the
rogue
no
longer
laid
them
on
his
shoulders
,
but
laid
on
*NL*
to
the
trees
,
with
such
groans
every
now
and
then
,
that
one
would
have
*NL*
thought
at
each
of
them
his
soul
was
being
plucked
up
by
the
roots
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
touched
to
the
heart
,
and
fearing
he
might
make
an
end
of
*NL*
himself
,
and
that
through
Sancho
's
imprudence
he
might
miss
his
own
*NL*
object
,
said
to
him
,
``
As
thou
livest
,
my
friend

let
the
matter
rest
*NL*
where
it
is

for
the
remedy

to
me
a
very
rough
one
,
and
it
will
be
*NL*
well
to
have
patience
;
`
Zamora
was
not
won
in
an
hour
.
'
If
I
have
not
*NL*
reckoned
wrong
thou
hast
given
thyself
over
a
thousand
lashes

that
is
*NL*
enough
for
the
present
;
`
for
the
ass

to
put
it
in
homely
phrase
,

bears
*NL*
the
load
,
but
not
the
overload

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

''
replied
Sancho
;
``
it
shall
never
be
said
of

The
*NL*
money
paid

arms
broken

go
back
a
little
further
,
your
worship

and
*NL*
let
me
give
myself
at
any

a
thousand
lashes
more

for
in
a

of

bouts
like
this
we
shall
have
finished
off
the
lot
,
and
there
will
be
*NL*
even
cloth
to
spare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
thou
art
in
such
a
willing
mood
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
may
heaven
aid
*NL*
thee
;
lay
on
and
I
'll
retire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
returned
to
his
task
with
so
much
resolution
that
he
soon
had
the
*NL*
bark
stripped
off
several
trees
,
such
was
the
severity
with
which
he
*NL*
whipped
himself
;
and
one
time
,
raising
his
voice
,
and
giving
a
beech
a
*NL*
tremendous
lash
,
he
cried
out
,
``
Here
dies
Samson
,
and
all
with
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sound
of
his
piteous
cry
and
of
the
stroke
of
the
cruel
lash
,
Don
*NL*
Quixote
ran
to
him
at
once
,
and
seizing
the
twisted
halter
that
served
*NL*
him
for
a
courbash
,
said
to
him
,
``
Heaven
forbid
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
that
*NL*
to
please
me
thou
shouldst
lose
thy
life
,
which
is
needed
for
the
support
*NL*
of
thy
wife
and
children
;
let
Dulcinea
wait
for
a
better
opportunity
,
and
*NL*
I
will
content
myself
with
a
hope
soon
to
be
realised
,
and
have
patience
*NL*
until
thou
hast
gained
fresh
strength
so
as
to
finish
off
this
business
*NL*
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
your
worship
will
have
it
so
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
so
be
it
;
but
*NL*
throw
your
cloak
over
my
shoulders
,
for
I
'm
sweating
and
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
take
cold
;
it
's
a
risk
that
novice
disciplinants
run
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
obeyed
,
and
stripping
himself
covered
Sancho
,
who
slept
until
*NL*
the
sun
woke
him
;
they
then
resumed
their
journey
,
which
for
the
time
*NL*
being
they
brought
to
an
end
at
a
village
that
lay
three
leagues
farther
*NL*
on
.
They
dismounted
at
a
hostelry
which
Don
Quixote
recognised
as
such
*NL*
and
did
not
take
to
be
a
castle
with
moat
,
turrets
,
portcullis
,
and
*NL*
drawbridge
;
for
ever
since
he
had
been
vanquished
he
talked
more
*NL*
rationally
about
everything
,
as
will
be
shown
presently
.
They
quartered
*NL*
him
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
,
where
in
place
of
leather
hangings
*NL*
there
were
pieces
of
painted
serge
such
as
they
commonly
use
in
villages
.
*NL*
On
one
of
them
was
painted
by
some
very
poor
hand
the
Rape
of
Helen
,
when
*NL*
the
bold
guest
carried
her
off
from
Menelaus
,
and
on
the
other
was
the
*NL*
story
of
Dido
and
AEneas
,
she
on
a
high
tower
,
as
though
she
were
making
*NL*
signals
with
a
half
sheet
to
her
fugitive
guest
who
was
out
at
sea
flying
*NL*
in
a
frigate
or
brigantine
.
He
noticed
in
the
two
stories
that
Helen
did
*NL*
not
go
very
reluctantly
,
for
she
was
laughing
slyly
and
roguishly
;
but
*NL*
the
fair
Dido
was
shown
dropping
tears
the
size
of
walnuts
from
her
eyes
.
*NL*
Don
Quixote
as
he
looked
at
them
observed
,
``
Those
two
ladies
were
very
*NL*
unfortunate
not
to
have
been
born
in
this
age
,
and
I
unfortunate
above
*NL*
all
men
not
to
have
been
born
in
theirs
.
Had
I
fallen
in
with
those
*NL*
gentlemen
,
Troy
would
not
have
been
burned
or
Carthage
destroyed
,
for
it
*NL*
would
have
been
only
for
me
to
slay
Paris
,
and
all
these
misfortunes
*NL*
would
have
been
avoided
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
lay
a
bet
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
that
before
long
there
wo
n't
be
a
tavern
,
*NL*
roadside
inn
,
hostelry
,
or
barber
's
shop
where
the
story
of
our
doings
*NL*
wo
n't
be
painted
up
;
but
I
'd
like
it
painted
by
the
hand
of
a
better
*NL*
painter
than
painted
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
right
,
Sancho
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
for
this
painter
is
like
*NL*
Orbaneja
,
a
painter
there
was
at
Ubeda
,
who
when
they
asked
him
what
he
*NL*
was
painting
,
used
to
say
,
`
Whatever
it
may
turn
out
;
and
if
he
chanced
*NL*
to
paint
a
cock
he
would
write
under
it
,
`
This
is
a
cock
,
'
for
fear
they
*NL*
might
think
it
was
a
fox
.
The
painter
or
writer
,
for
it
's
all
the
same
,
*NL*
who
published
the
history
of
this
new
Don
Quixote
that
has
come
out
,
must
*NL*
have
been
one
of
this
sort
I
think
,
Sancho
,
for
he
painted
or
wrote
*NL*
`
whatever
it
might
turn
out
;
'
or
perhaps
he
is
like
a
poet
called
Mauleon
*NL*
that
was
about
the
Court
some
years
ago
,
who
used
to
answer
at
haphazard
*NL*
whatever
he
was
asked
,
and
on
one
asking
him
what
Deum
de
Deo
meant
,
he
*NL*
replied
De
donde
diere
.
But
,
putting
this
aside
,
tell
me
,
Sancho
,
hast
*NL*
thou
a
mind
to
have
another
turn
at
thyself
to-night
,
and
wouldst
thou
*NL*
rather
have
it
indoors
or
in
the
open
air
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Egad
,
senor
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
for
what
I
'm
going
to
give
myself
,
it
comes
*NL*
all
the
same
to
me
whether
it
is
in
a
house
or
in
the
fields
;
still
I
'd
*NL*
like
it
to
be
among
trees
;
for
I
think
they
are
company
for
me
and
help
*NL*
me
to
bear
my
pain
wonderfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
it
must
not
be
,
Sancho
my
friend
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
,
to
*NL*
enable
thee
to
recover
strength
,
we
must
keep
it
for
our
own
village
;
for
*NL*
at
the
latest
we
shall
get
there
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
said
he
might
do
as
he
pleased
;
but
that
for
his
own
part
he
would
*NL*
like
to
finish
off
the
business
quickly
before
his
blood
cooled
and
while
*NL*
he
had
an
appetite
,
because
``
in
delay
there
is
apt
to
be
danger
''
very
*NL*
often
,
and
``
praying
to
God
and
plying
the
hammer
,
''
and
``
one
take
was
*NL*
better
than
two
I
'll
give
thee
's
,
''
and
``
a
sparrow
in
the
hand
than
a
*NL*
vulture
on
the
wing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
God
's
sake
,
Sancho
,
no
more
proverbs
!
''
exclaimed
Don
Quixote
;
``
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
thou
art
becoming
sicut
erat
again
;
speak
in
a
plain
,
simple
,
*NL*
straight-forward
way
,
as
I
have
often
told
thee
,
and
thou
wilt
find
the
*NL*
good
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
bad
luck
it
is
of
mine
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
but
I
ca
n't
*NL*
utter
a
word
without
a
proverb
that
is
not
as
good
as
an
argument
to
my
*NL*
mind
;
however
,
I
mean
to
mend
if
I
can

so
for

CHAPTER
LXXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
HOW
DON
QUIXOTE
AND
SANCHO
REACHED
THEIR
VILLAGE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
day
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
remained
in
the
village
and
inn
*NL*
waiting
for
night
,
the
one
to
finish
off
his
task
of
scourging
in
the
*NL*
open
country
,
the
other
to
see
it
accomplished
,
for
therein
lay
the
*NL*
accomplishment
of
his
wishes
.
Meanwhile
there
arrived
at
the
hostelry
a
*NL*
traveller
on
horseback
with
three
or
four
servants
,
one
of
whom
said
to
*NL*
him
who
appeared
to
be
the
master
,
``
Here
,
Senor
Don
Alvaro
Tarfe
,
your
*NL*
worship
may
take
your
siesta
to-day
;
the
quarters
seem
clean
and
cool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
heard
this
Don
Quixote
said
to
Sancho
,
``
Look
here
,
Sancho
;
on
*NL*
turning
over
the
leaves
of
that
book
of
the
Second
Part
of
my
history
I
*NL*
think
I
came
casually
upon
this
name
of
Don
Alvaro
Tarfe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
we
had
better
let
him
dismount
,
and
*NL*
by-and-by
we
can
ask
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
dismounted
,
and
the
landlady
gave
him
a
room
on
the
ground
*NL*
floor
opposite
Don
Quixote
's
and
adorned
with
painted
serge
hangings
of
*NL*
the
same
sort
.
The
newly
arrived
gentleman
put
on
a
summer
coat
,
and
*NL*
coming
out
to
the
gateway
of
the
hostelry
,
which
was
wide
and
cool
,
*NL*
addressing
Don
Quixote
,
who
was
pacing
up
and
down
there
,
he
asked
,
``
In
*NL*
what
direction
is
your
worship
bound
,
gentle
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
a
village
near
this
which
is
my
own
village
,
''
replied
Don
Quixote
;
*NL*
``
and
your
worship
,
where
are
you
bound
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
Granada
,
senor
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
``
to
my
own
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
goodly
country
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
but
will
your
worship
do
me
*NL*
the
favour
of
telling
me
your
name
,
for
it
strikes
me
it
is
of
more
*NL*
importance
to
me
to
know
it
than
I
can
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Don
Alvaro
Tarfe
,
''
replied
the
traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Don
Quixote
returned
,
``
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
your
*NL*
worship
is
that
Don
Alvaro
Tarfe
who
appears
in
print
in
the
Second
Part
*NL*
of
the
history
of
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
lately
printed
and
published
*NL*
by
a
new
author
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
same
,
''
replied
the
gentleman
;
``
and
that
same
Don
Quixote
,
the
*NL*
principal
personage
in
the
said
history
,
was
a
very
great
friend
of
mine
,
*NL*
and
it
was
I
who
took
him
away
from
home
,
or
at
least
induced
him
to
come
*NL*
to
some
jousts
that
were
to
be
held
at
Saragossa
,
whither
I
was
going
*NL*
myself
;
indeed
,
I
showed
him
many
kindnesses
,
and
saved
him
from
having
*NL*
his
shoulders
touched
up
by
the
executioner
because
of
his
extreme
*NL*
rashness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
Senor
Don
Alvaro
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
am
I
at
all
like
that
Don
*NL*
Quixote
you
talk
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
indeed
,
''
replied
the
traveller
,
``
not
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
Don
Quixote
-
''
said
our
one
,
``
had
he
with
him
a
squire
called
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
,
''
said
Don
Alvaro
;
``
but
though
he
had
the
name
of
being
very
*NL*
droll
,
I
never
heard
him
say
anything
that
had
any
drollery
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
well
believe
,
''
said
Sancho
at
this
,
``
for
to
come
out
with
*NL*
drolleries
is
not
in
everybody
's
line
;
and
that
Sancho
your
worship
*NL*
speaks
of
,
gentle
sir
,
must
be
some
great
scoundrel
,
dunderhead
,
and
*NL*
thief
,
all
in
one
;
for
I
am
the
real
Sancho
Panza
,
and
I
have
more
*NL*
drolleries
than
if
it
rained
them
;
let
your
worship
only
try
;
come
along
*NL*
with
me
for
a
year
or
so
,
and
you
will
find
they
fall
from
me
at
every
*NL*
turn
,
and
so
rich
and
so
plentiful
that
though
mostly
I
do
n't
know
what
I
*NL*
am
saying
I
make
everybody
that
hears
me
laugh
.
And
the
real
Don
Quixote
*NL*
of
La
Mancha
,
the
famous
,
the
valiant
,
the
wise
,
the
lover
,
the
righter
*NL*
of
wrongs
,
the
guardian
of
minors
and
orphans
,
the
protector
of
widows
,
*NL*
the
killer
of
damsels
,
he
who
has
for
his
sole
mistress
the
peerless
*NL*
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
is
this
gentleman
before
you
,
my
master
;
all
other
*NL*
Don
Quixotes
and
all
other
Sancho
Panzas
are
dreams
and
mockeries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
I
believe
it
,
''
said
Don
Alvaro
;
``
for
you
have
uttered
more
*NL*
drolleries
,
my
friend
,
in
the
few
words
you
have
spoken
than
the
other
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
in
all
I
ever
heard
from
him
,
and
they
were
not
a
few
.
He
*NL*
was
more
greedy
than
well-spoken
,
and
more
dull
than
droll
;
and
I
am
*NL*
convinced
that
the
enchanters
who
persecute
Don
Quixote
the
Good
have
*NL*
been
trying
to
persecute
me
with
Don
Quixote
the
Bad
.
But
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
say
,
for
I
am
ready
to
swear
I
left
him
shut
up
in
the
Casa
del
*NL*
Nuncio
at
Toledo
,
and
here
another
Don
Quixote
turns
up
,
though
a
very
*NL*
different
one
from
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
am
good
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
but
I
can
safely
say
*NL*
I
am
not
`
the
Bad
;
'
and
to
prove
it
,
let
me
tell
you
,
Senor
Don
Alvaro
*NL*
Tarfe
,
I
have
never
in
my
life
been
in
Saragossa
;
so
far
from
that
,
when
*NL*
it
was
told
me
that
this
imaginary
Don
Quixote
had
been
present
at
the
*NL*
jousts
in
that
city
,
I
declined
to
enter
it
,
in
order
to
drag
his
*NL*
falsehood
before
the
face
of
the
world
;
and
so
I
went
on
straight
to
*NL*
Barcelona
,
the
treasure-house
of
courtesy
,
haven
of
strangers
,
asylum
of
*NL*
the
poor
,
home
of
the
valiant
,
champion
of
the
wronged
,
pleasant
exchange
*NL*
of
firm
friendships
,
and
city
unrivalled
in
site
and
beauty
.
And
though
*NL*
the
adventures
that
befell
me
there
are
not
by
any
means
matters
of
*NL*
enjoyment
,
but
rather
of
regret
,
I
do
not
regret
them
,
simply
because
I
*NL*
have
seen
it
.
In
a
word
,
Senor
Don
Alvaro
Tarfe
,
I
am
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
the
one
that
fame
speaks
of
,
and
not
the
unlucky
one
that
has
*NL*
attempted
to
usurp
my
name
and
deck
himself
out
in
my
ideas
.
I
entreat
*NL*
your
worship
by
your
devoir
as
a
gentleman
to
be
so
good
as
to
make
a
*NL*
declaration
before
the
alcalde
of
this
village
that
you
never
in
all
your
*NL*
life
saw
me
until
now
,
and
that
neither
am
I
the
Don
Quixote
in
print
in
*NL*
the
Second
Part
,
nor
this
Sancho
Panza
,
my
squire
,
the
one
your
worship
*NL*
knew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
do
most
willingly
,
''
replied
Don
Alvaro
;
``
though
it
amazes
me
*NL*
to
find
two
Don
Quixotes
and
two
Sancho
Panzas
at
once
,
as
much
alike
in
*NL*
name
as
they
differ
in
demeanour
;
and
again
I
say
and
declare
that
what
I
*NL*
saw
I
can
not
have
seen
,
and
that
what
happened
me
can
not
have
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
your
worship
is
enchanted
,
like
my
lady
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
''
*NL*
said
Sancho
;
``
and
would
to
heaven
your
disenchantment
rested
on
my
giving
*NL*
myself
another
three
thousand
and
odd
lashes
like
what
I
'm
giving
myself
*NL*
for
her
,
for
I
'd
lay
them
on
without
looking
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
that
about
the
lashes
,
''
said
Don
Alvaro
.
Sancho
*NL*
replied
that
it
was
a
long
story
to
tell
,
but
he
would
tell
him
if
they
*NL*
happened
to
be
going
the
same
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
dinner-time
arrived
,
and
Don
Quixote
and
Don
Alvaro
dined
*NL*
together
.
The
alcalde
of
the
village
came
by
chance
into
the
inn
together
*NL*
with
a
notary
,
and
Don
Quixote
laid
a
petition
before
him
,
showing
that
*NL*
it
was
requisite
for
his
rights
that
Don
Alvaro
Tarfe
,
the
gentleman
*NL*
there
present
,
should
make
a
declaration
before
him
that
he
did
not
know
*NL*
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
also
there
present
,
and
that
he
was
not
the
one
*NL*
that
was
in
print
in
a
history
entitled
``
Second
Part
of
Don
Quixote
of
La
*NL*
Mancha
,
by
one
Avellaneda
of
Tordesillas
.
''
The
alcalde
finally
put
it
in
*NL*
legal
form
,
and
the
declaration
was
made
with
all
the
formalities
*NL*
required
in
such
cases
,
at
which
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
were
in
high
*NL*
delight
,
as
if
a
declaration
of
the
sort
was
of
any
great
importance
to
*NL*
them
,
and
as
if
their
words
and
deeds
did
not
plainly
show
the
difference
*NL*
between
the
two
Don
Quixotes
and
the
two
Sanchos
.
Many
civilities
and
*NL*
offers
of
service
were
exchanged
by
Don
Alvaro
and
Don
Quixote
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
which
the
great
Manchegan
displayed
such
good
taste
that
he
*NL*
disabused
Don
Alvaro
of
the
error
he
was
under
;
and
he
,
on
his
part
,
felt
*NL*
convinced
he
must
have
been
enchanted
,
now
that
he
had
been
brought
in
*NL*
contact
with
two
such
opposite
Don
Quixotes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
came
,
they
set
out
from
the
village
,
and
after
about
half
a
*NL*
league
two
roads
branched
off
,
one
leading
to
Don
Quixote
's
village
,
the
*NL*
other
the
road
Don
Alvaro
was
to
follow
.
In
this
short
interval
Don
*NL*
Quixote
told
him
of
his
unfortunate
defeat
,
and
of
Dulcinea
's
enchantment
*NL*
and
the
remedy
,
all
which
threw
Don
Alvaro
into
fresh
amazement
,
and
*NL*
embracing
Don
Quixote
and
Sancho
he
went
his
way
,
and
Don
Quixote
went
*NL*
his
.
That
night
he
passed
among
trees
again
in
order
to
give
Sancho
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
working
out
his
penance
,
which
he
did
in
the
same
fashion
*NL*
as
the
night
before
,
at
the
expense
of
the
bark
of
the
beech
trees
much
*NL*
more
than
of
his
back
,
of
which
he
took
such
good
care
that
the
lashes
*NL*
would
not
have
knocked
off
a
fly
had
there
been
one
there
.
The
duped
Don
*NL*
Quixote
did
not
miss
a
single
stroke
of
the
count
,
and
he
found
that
*NL*
together
with
those
of
the
night
before
they
made
up
three
thousand
and
*NL*
twenty-nine
.
The
sun
apparently
had
got
up
early
to
witness
the
*NL*
sacrifice
,
and
with
his
light
they
resumed
their
journey
,
discussing
the
*NL*
deception
practised
on
Don
Alvaro
,
and
saying
how
well
done
it
was
to
*NL*
have
taken
his
declaration
before
a
magistrate
in
such
an
unimpeachable
*NL*
form
.
That
day
and
night
they
travelled
on
,
nor
did
anything
worth
*NL*
mention
happen
to
them
,
unless
it
was
that
in
the
course
of
the
night
Sancho
*NL*
finished
off
his
task
,
whereat
Don
Quixote
was
beyond
measure
joyful
.
He
*NL*
watched
for
daylight
,
to
see
if
along
the
road
he
should
fall
in
with
his
*NL*
already
disenchanted
lady
Dulcinea
;
and
as
he
pursued
his
journey
there
*NL*
was
no
woman
he
met
that
he
did
not
go
up
to
,
to
see
if
she
was
Dulcinea
*NL*
del
Toboso
,
as
he
held
it
absolutely
certain
that
Merlin
's
promises
could
*NL*
not
lie
.
Full
of
these
thoughts
and
anxieties
,
they
ascended
a
rising
*NL*
ground
wherefrom
they
descried
their
own
village
,
at
the
sight
of
which
*NL*
Sancho
fell
on
his
knees
exclaiming
,
``
Open
thine
eyes
,
longed-for
home
,
*NL*
and
see
how
thy
son
Sancho
Panza
comes
back
to
thee
,
if
not
very
rich
,
*NL*
very
well
whipped
!
Open
thine
arms
and
receive
,
too
,
thy
son
Don
Quixote
,
*NL*
who
,
if
he
comes
vanquished
by
the
arm
of
another
,
comes
victor
over
*NL*
himself
,
which
,
as
he
himself
has
told
me
,
is
the
greatest
victory
anyone
*NL*
can
desire
.
I
'm
bringing
back
money
,
for
if
I
was
well
whipped
,
I
went
*NL*
mounted
like
a
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
done
with
these
fooleries
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
let
us
push
on
*NL*
straight
and
get
to
our
own
place
,
where
we
will
give
free
range
to
our
*NL*
fancies
,
and
settle
our
plans
for
our
future
pastoral
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
they
descended
the
slope
and
directed
their
steps
to
their
*NL*
village
.

CHAPTER
LXXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
THE
OMENS
DON
QUIXOTE
HAD
AS
HE
ENTERED
HIS
OWN
VILLAGE
,
AND
OTHER
*NL*
INCIDENTS
THAT
EMBELLISH
AND
GIVE
A
COLOUR
TO
THIS
GREAT
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
entrance
of
the
village
,
so
says
Cide
Hamete
,
Don
Quixote
saw
two
*NL*
boys
quarrelling
on
the
village
threshing-floor
one
of
whom
said
to
the
*NL*
other
,
``
Take
it
easy
,
Periquillo
;
thou
shalt
never
see
it
again
as
long
*NL*
as
thou
livest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
heard
this
,
and
said
he
to
Sancho
,
``
Dost
thou
not
mark
,
*NL*
friend
,
what
that
boy
said
,
`
Thou
shalt
never
see
it
again
as
long
as
*NL*
thou
livest
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Sancho
,
``
what
does
it
matter
if
the
boy
said
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
dost
thou
not
see
that
,
applied
to
the
object
*NL*
of
my
desires
,
the
words
mean
that
I
am
never
to
see
Dulcinea
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sancho
was
about
to
answer
,
when
his
attention
was
diverted
by
seeing
a
*NL*
hare
come
flying
across
the
plain
pursued
by
several
greyhounds
and
*NL*
sportsmen
.
In
its
terror
it
ran
to
take
shelter
and
hide
itself
under
*NL*
Dapple
.
Sancho
caught
it
alive
and
presented
it
to
Don
Quixote
,
who
was
*NL*
saying
,
``
Malum
signum
,
malum
signum
!
a
hare
flies
,
greyhounds
chase
it
,
*NL*
Dulcinea
appears
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
's
a
strange
man
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
let
's
take
it
for
granted
*NL*
that
this
hare
is
Dulcinea
,
and
these
greyhounds
chasing
it
the
malignant
*NL*
enchanters
who
turned
her
into
a
country
wench
;
she
flies
,
and
I
catch
*NL*
her
and
put
her
into
your
worship
's
hands
,
and
you
hold
her
in
your
arms
*NL*
and
cherish
her
;
what
bad
sign
is
that
,
or
what
ill
omen
is
there
to
be
*NL*
found
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
boys
who
had
been
quarrelling
came
over
to
look
at
the
hare
,
and
*NL*
Sancho
asked
one
of
them
what
their
quarrel
was
about
.
He
was
answered
by
*NL*
the
one
who
had
said
,
``
Thou
shalt
never
see
it
again
as
long
as
thou
*NL*
livest
,
''
that
he
had
taken
a
cage
full
of
crickets
from
the
other
boy
,
*NL*
and
did
not
mean
to
give
it
back
to
him
as
long
as
he
lived
.
Sancho
took
*NL*
out
four
cuartos
from
his
pocket
and
gave
them
to
the
boy
for
the
cage
,
*NL*
which
he
placed
in
Don
Quixote
's
hands
,
saying
,
``
There
,
senor
!
there
are
*NL*
the
omens
broken
and
destroyed
,
and
they
have
no
more
to
do
with
our
*NL*
affairs
,
to
my
thinking
,
fool
as
I
am
,
than
with
last
year
's
clouds
;
and
*NL*
if
I
remember
rightly
I
have
heard
the
curate
of
our
village
say
that
it
*NL*
does
not
become
Christians
or
sensible
people
to
give
any
heed
to
these
*NL*
silly
things
;
and
even
you
yourself
said
the
same
to
me
some
time
ago
,
*NL*
telling
me
that
all
Christians
who
minded
omens
were
fools
;
but
there
's
*NL*
no
need
of
making
words
about
it
;
let
us
push
on
and
go
into
our
*NL*
village
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sportsmen
came
up
and
asked
for
their
hare
,
which
Don
Quixote
gave
*NL*
them
.
They
then
went
on
,
and
upon
the
green
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
*NL*
they
came
upon
the
curate
and
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
busy
with
*NL*
their
breviaries
.
It
should
be
mentioned
that
Sancho
had
thrown
,
by
way
*NL*
of
a
sumpter-cloth
,
over
Dapple
and
over
the
bundle
of
armour
,
the
*NL*
buckram
robe
painted
with
flames
which
they
had
put
upon
him
at
the
*NL*
duke
's
castle
the
night
Altisidora
came
back
to
life
.
He
had
also
fixed
*NL*
the
mitre
on
Dapple
's
head
,
the
oddest
transformation
and
decoration
that
*NL*
ever
ass
in
the
world
underwent
.
They
were
at
once
recognised
by
both
the
*NL*
curate
and
the
bachelor
,
who
came
towards
them
with
open
arms
.
Don
*NL*
Quixote
dismounted
and
received
them
with
a
close
embrace
;
and
the
boys
,
*NL*
who
are
lynxes
that
nothing
escapes
,
spied
out
the
ass
's
mitre
and
came
*NL*
running
to
see
it
,
calling
out
to
one
another
,
``
Come
here
,
boys
,
and
see
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
's
ass
figged
out
finer
than
Mingo
,
and
Don
Quixote
's
beast
*NL*
leaner
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
at
length
,
with
the
boys
capering
round
them
,
and
accompanied
by
the
*NL*
curate
and
the
bachelor
,
they
made
their
entrance
into
the
town
,
and
*NL*
proceeded
to
Don
Quixote
's
house
,
at
the
door
of
which
they
found
his
*NL*
housekeeper
and
niece
,
whom
the
news
of
his
arrival
had
already
reached
.
*NL*
It
had
been
brought
to
Teresa
Panza
,
Sancho
's
wife
,
as
well
,
and
she
with
*NL*
her
hair
all
loose
and
half
naked
,
dragging
Sanchica
her
daughter
by
the
*NL*
hand
,
ran
out
to
meet
her
husband
;
but
seeing
him
coming
in
by
no
means
*NL*
as
good
case
as
she
thought
a
governor
ought
to
be
,
she
said
to
him
,
``
How
*NL*
is
it
you
come
this
way
,
husband
?
It
seems
to
me
you
come
tramping
and
*NL*
footsore
,
and
looking
more
like
a
disorderly
vagabond
than
a
governor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
Teresa
,
''
said
Sancho
;
``
often
`
where
there
are
pegs
*NL*
there
are
no
flitches
;
'
let
's
go
into
the
house
and
there
you
'll
hear
*NL*
strange
things
.
I
bring
money
,
and
that
's
the
main
thing
,
got
by
my
own
*NL*
industry
without
wronging
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bring
the
money
,
my
good
husband
,
''
said
Teresa
,
``
and
no
matter
*NL*
whether
it
was
got
this
way
or
that
;
for
,
however
you
may
have
got
it
,
*NL*
you
'll
not
have
brought
any
new
practice
into
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sanchica
embraced
her
father
and
asked
him
if
he
brought
her
anything
,
*NL*
for
she
had
been
looking
out
for
him
as
for
the
showers
of
May
;
and
she
*NL*
taking
hold
of
him
by
the
girdle
on
one
side
,
and
his
wife
by
the
hand
,
*NL*
while
the
daughter
led
Dapple
,
they
made
for
their
house
,
leaving
Don
*NL*
Quixote
in
his
,
in
the
hands
of
his
niece
and
housekeeper
,
and
in
the
*NL*
company
of
the
curate
and
the
bachelor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
at
once
,
without
any
regard
to
time
or
season
,
withdrew
in
*NL*
private
with
the
bachelor
and
the
curate
,
and
in
a
few
words
told
them
of
*NL*
his
defeat
,
and
of
the
engagement
he
was
under
not
to
quit
his
village
*NL*
for
a
year
,
which
he
meant
to
keep
to
the
letter
without
departing
a
*NL*
hair
's
breadth
from
it
,
as
became
a
knight-errant
bound
by
scrupulous
*NL*
good
faith
and
the
laws
of
knight-errantry
;
and
of
how
he
thought
of
*NL*
turning
shepherd
for
that
year
,
and
taking
his
diversion
in
the
solitude
*NL*
of
the
fields
,
where
he
could
with
perfect
freedom
give
range
to
his
*NL*
thoughts
of
love
while
he
followed
the
virtuous
pastoral
calling
;
and
he
*NL*
besought
them
,
if
they
had
not
a
great
deal
to
do
and
were
not
prevented
*NL*
by
more
important
business
,
to
consent
to
be
his
companions
,
for
he
would
*NL*
buy
sheep
enough
to
qualify
them
for
shepherds
;
and
the
most
important
*NL*
point
of
the
whole
affair
,
he
could
tell
them
,
was
settled
,
for
he
had
*NL*
given
them
names
that
would
fit
them
to
a
T
.
The
curate
asked
what
they
*NL*
were
.
Don
Quixote
replied
that
he
himself
was
to
be
called
the
shepherd
*NL*
Quixotize
and
the
bachelor
the
shepherd
Carrascon
,
and
the
curate
the
*NL*
shepherd
Curambro
,
and
Sancho
Panza
the
shepherd
Pancino
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
astounded
at
Don
Quixote
's
new
craze
;
however
,
lest
he
should
*NL*
once
more
make
off
out
of
the
village
from
them
in
pursuit
of
his
*NL*
chivalry
,
they
trusting
that
in
the
course
of
the
year
he
might
be
cured
,
*NL*
fell
in
with
his
new
project
,
applauded
his
crazy
idea
as
a
bright
one
,
*NL*
and
offered
to
share
the
life
with
him
.
``
And
what
's
more
,
''
said
Samson
*NL*
Carrasco
,
``
I
am
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
a
very
famous
poet
,
and
I
'll
be
*NL*
always
making
verses
,
pastoral
,
or
courtly
,
or
as
it
may
come
into
my
*NL*
head
,
to
pass
away
our
time
in
those
secluded
regions
where
we
shall
be
*NL*
roaming
.
But
what
is
most
needful
,
sirs
,
is
that
each
of
us
should
choose
*NL*
the
name
of
the
shepherdess
he
means
to
glorify
in
his
verses
,
and
that
*NL*
we
should
not
leave
a
tree
,
be
it
ever
so
hard
,
without
writing
up
and
*NL*
carving
her
name
on
it
,
as
is
the
habit
and
custom
of
love-smitten
*NL*
shepherds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
very
thing
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
though
I
am
relieved
from
*NL*
looking
for
the
name
of
an
imaginary
shepherdess
,
for
there
's
the
*NL*
peerless
Dulcinea
del
Toboso
,
the
glory
of
these
brooksides
,
the
ornament
*NL*
of
these
meadows
,
the
mainstay
of
beauty
,
the
cream
of
all
the
graces
,
*NL*
and
,
in
a
word
,
the
being
to
whom
all
praise
is
appropriate
,
be
it
ever
*NL*
so
hyperbolical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
''
said
the
curate
;
``
but
we
the
others
must
look
about
for
*NL*
accommodating
shepherdesses
that
will
answer
our
purpose
one
way
or
*NL*
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
''
added
Samson
Carrasco
,
``
if
they
fail
us
,
we
can
call
them
by
the
*NL*
names
of
the
ones
in
print
that
the
world
is
filled
with
,
Filidas
,
*NL*
Amarilises
,
Dianas
,
Fleridas
,
Galateas
,
Belisardas
;
for
as
they
sell
them
*NL*
in
the
market-places
we
may
fairly
buy
them
and
make
them
our
own
.
If
my
*NL*
lady
,
or
I
should
say
my
shepherdess
,
happens
to
be
called
Ana
,
I
'll
sing
*NL*
her
praises
under
the
name
of
Anarda
,
and
if
Francisca
,
I
'll
call
her
*NL*
Francenia
,
and
if
Lucia
,
Lucinda
,
for
it
all
comes
to
the
same
thing
;
and
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
,
if
he
joins
this
fraternity
,
may
glorify
his
wife
Teresa
*NL*
Panza
as
Teresaina
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Don
Quixote
laughed
at
the
adaptation
of
the
name
,
and
the
curate
*NL*
bestowed
vast
praise
upon
the
worthy
and
honourable
resolution
he
had
*NL*
made
,
and
again
offered
to
bear
him
company
all
the
time
that
he
could
*NL*
spare
from
his
imperative
duties
.
And
so
they
took
their
leave
of
him
,
*NL*
recommending
and
beseeching
him
to
take
care
of
his
health
and
treat
*NL*
himself
to
a
suitable
diet
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
his
niece
and
the
housekeeper
overheard
all
the
three
of
*NL*
them
said
;
and
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
they
both
of
them
came
in
to
Don
*NL*
Quixote
,
and
said
the
niece
,
``
What
's
this
,
uncle
?
Now
that
we
were
*NL*
thinking
you
had
come
back
to
stay
at
home
and
lead
a
quiet
respectable
*NL*
life
there
,
are
you
going
to
get
into
fresh
entanglements
,
and
turn
*NL*
`
young
shepherd
,
thou
that
comest
here
,
young
shepherd
going
there
?
'
Nay
!
*NL*
indeed
`
the
straw
is
too
hard
now
to
make
pipes
of
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
''
added
the
housekeeper
,
``
will
your
worship
be
able
to
bear
,
out
in
*NL*
the
fields
,
the
heats
of
summer
,
and
the
chills
of
winter
,
and
the
*NL*
howling
of
the
wolves
?
Not
you
;
for
that
's
a
life
and
a
business
for
*NL*
hardy
men
,
bred
and
seasoned
to
such
work
almost
from
the
time
they
were
*NL*
in
swaddling-clothes
.
Why
,
to
make
choice
of
evils
,
it
's
better
to
be
a
*NL*
knight-errant
than
a
shepherd
!
Look
here
,
senor
;
take
my
advice
--
and
I
'm
*NL*
not
giving
it
to
you
full
of
bread
and
wine
,
but
fasting
,
and
with
fifty
*NL*
years
upon
my
head
--
stay
at
home
,
look
after
your
affairs
,
go
often
to
*NL*
confession
,
be
good
to
the
poor
,
and
upon
my
soul
be
it
if
any
evil
comes
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
peace
,
my
daughters
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
;
``
I
know
very
well
what
*NL*
my
duty
is
;
help
me
to
bed
,
for
I
do
n't
feel
very
well
;
and
rest
assured
*NL*
that
,
knight-errant
now
or
wandering
shepherd
to
be
,
I
shall
never
fail
*NL*
to
have
a
care
for
your
interests
,
as
you
will
see
in
the
end

And
the
*NL*
good
wenches
-LRB-
for
that
they
undoubtedly
were
-RRB-
,
the
housekeeper

niece
,
*NL*
helped
him
to

where
they
gave
him
something
to
eat

made
him

comfortable

CHAPTER
LXXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
OF
HOW
DON
QUIXOTE
FELL
SICK
,
AND
OF
THE
WILL
HE
MADE
,
AND
HOW
HE
DIED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
nothing
that
is
man
's
can
last
for
ever
,
but
all
tends
ever
downwards
*NL*
from
its
beginning
to
its
end
,
and
above
all
man
's
life
,
and
as
Don
*NL*
Quixote
's
enjoyed
no
special
dispensation
from
heaven
to
stay
its
course
,
*NL*
its
end
and
close
came
when
he
least
looked
for
it
.
For
whether
it
was
of
*NL*
the
dejection
the
thought
of
his
defeat
produced
,
or
of
heaven
's
will
*NL*
that
so
ordered
it
--
a
fever
settled
upon
him
and
kept
him
in
his
bed
for
*NL*
six
days
,
during
which
he
was
often
visited
by
his
friends
the
curate
,
*NL*
the
bachelor
,
and
the
barber
,
while
his
good
squire
Sancho
Panza
never
*NL*
quitted
his
bedside
.
They
,
persuaded
that
it
was
grief
at
finding
himself
*NL*
vanquished
,
and
the
object
of
his
heart
,
the
liberation
and
*NL*
disenchantment
of
Dulcinea
,
unattained
,
that
kept
him
in
this
state
,
*NL*
strove
by
all
the
means
in
their
power
to
cheer
him
up
;
the
bachelor
*NL*
bidding
him
take
heart
and
get
up
to
begin
his
pastoral
life
,
for
which
*NL*
he
himself
,
he
said
,
had
already
composed
an
eclogue
that
would
take
the
*NL*
shine
out
of
all
Sannazaro
had
ever
written
,
and
had
bought
with
his
own
*NL*
money
two
famous
dogs
to
guard
the
flock
,
one
called
Barcino
and
the
*NL*
other
Butron
,
which
a
herdsman
of
Quintanar
had
sold
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
all
this
Don
Quixote
could
not
shake
off
his
sadness
.
His
friends
*NL*
called
in
the
doctor
,
who
felt
his
pulse
and
was
not
very
well
satisfied
*NL*
with
it
,
and
said
that
in
any
case
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
attend
to
*NL*
the
health
of
his
soul
,
as
that
of
his
body
was
in
a
bad
way
.
Don
Quixote
*NL*
heard
this
calmly
;
but
not
so
his
housekeeper
,
his
niece
,
and
his
squire
,
*NL*
who
fell
weeping
bitterly
,
as
if
they
had
him
lying
dead
before
them
.
The
*NL*
doctor
's
opinion
was
that
melancholy
and
depression
were
bringing
him
to
*NL*
his
end
.
Don
Quixote
begged
them
to
leave
him
to
himself
,
as
he
had
a
*NL*
wish
to
sleep
a
little
.
They
obeyed
,
and
he
slept
at
one
stretch
,
as
the
*NL*
saying
is
,
more
than
six
hours
,
so
that
the
housekeeper
and
niece
thought
*NL*
he
was
going
to
sleep
for
ever
.
But
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
woke
up
,
*NL*
and
in
a
loud
voice
exclaimed
,
``
Blessed
be
Almighty
God
,
who
has
shown
me
*NL*
such
goodness
.
In
truth
his
mercies
are
boundless
,
and
the
sins
of
men
*NL*
can
neither
limit
them
nor
keep
them
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
niece
listened
with
attention
to
her
uncle
's
words
,
and
they
struck
*NL*
her
as
more
coherent
than
what
usually
fell
from
him
,
at
least
during
his
*NL*
illness
,
so
she
asked
,
``
What
are
you
saying
,
senor
?
Has
anything
strange
*NL*
occurred
?
What
mercies
or
what
sins
of
men
are
you
talking
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mercies
,
niece
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
are
those
that
God
has
this
*NL*
moment
shown
me
,
and
with
him
,
as
I
said
,
my
sins
are
no
impediment
to
*NL*
them
.
My
reason
is
now
free
and
clear
,
rid
of
the
dark
shadows
of
*NL*
ignorance
that
my
unhappy
constant
study
of
those
detestable
books
of
*NL*
chivalry
cast
over
it
.
Now
I
see
through
their
absurdities
and
*NL*
deceptions
,
and
it
only
grieves
me
that
this
destruction
of
my
illusions
*NL*
has
come
so
late
that
it
leaves
me
no
time
to
make
some
amends
by
reading
*NL*
other
books
that
might
be
a
light
to
my
soul
.
Niece
,
I
feel
myself
at
the
*NL*
point
of
death
,
and
I
would
fain
meet
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
that
my
*NL*
life
has
not
been
so
ill
that
I
should
leave
behind
me
the
name
of
a
*NL*
madman
;
for
though
I
have
been
one
,
I
would
not
that
the
fact
should
be
*NL*
made
plainer
at
my
death
.
Call
in
to
me
,
my
dear
,
my
good
friends
the
*NL*
curate
,
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
,
and
Master
Nicholas
the
barber
,
for
*NL*
I
wish
to
confess
and
make
my
will
.
''
But
his
niece
was
saved
the
trouble
*NL*
by
the
entrance
of
the
three
.
The
instant
Don
Quixote
saw
them
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Good
news
for
you
,
good
sirs
,
that
I
am
no
longer
Don
Quixote
*NL*
of
La
Mancha
,
but
Alonso
Quixano
,
whose
way
of
life
won
for
him
the
name
*NL*
of
Good
.
Now
am
I
the
enemy
of
Amadis
of
Gaul
and
of
the
whole
countless
*NL*
troop
of
his
descendants
;
odious
to
me
now
are
all
the
profane
stories
of
*NL*
knight-errantry
;
now
I
perceive
my
folly
,
and
the
peril
into
which
*NL*
reading
them
brought
me
;
now
,
by
God
's
mercy
schooled
into
my
right
*NL*
senses
,
I
loathe
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
three
heard
him
speak
in
this
way
,
they
had
no
doubt
whatever
*NL*
that
some
new
craze
had
taken
possession
of
him
;
and
said
Samson
,
``
What
?
*NL*
Senor
Don
Quixote
!
Now
that
we
have
intelligence
of
the
lady
Dulcinea
*NL*
being
disenchanted
,
are
you
taking
this
line
;
now
,
just
as
we
are
on
the
*NL*
point
of
becoming
shepherds
,
to
pass
our
lives
singing
,
like
princes
,
are
*NL*
you
thinking
of
turning
hermit
?
Hush
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
be
rational
and
*NL*
let
's
have
no
more
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
nonsense
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
``
that
until
now
has
been
a
reality
*NL*
to
my
hurt
,
my
death
will
,
with
heaven
's
help
,
turn
to
my
good
.
I
feel
,
*NL*
sirs
,
that
I
am
rapidly
drawing
near
death
;
a
truce
to
jesting
;
let
me
*NL*
have
a
confessor
to
confess
me
,
and
a
notary
to
make
my
will
;
for
in
*NL*
extremities
like
this
,
man
must
not
trifle
with
his
soul
;
and
while
the
*NL*
curate
is
confessing
me
let
some
one
,
I
beg
,
go
for
the
notary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
one
another
,
wondering
at
Don
Quixote
's
words
;
but
,
though
*NL*
uncertain
,
they
were
inclined
to
believe
him
,
and
one
of
the
signs
by
*NL*
which
they
came
to
the
conclusion
he
was
dying
was
this
so
sudden
and
*NL*
complete
return
to
his
senses
after
having
been
mad
;
for
to
the
words
*NL*
already
quoted
he
added
much
more
,
so
well
expressed
,
so
devout
,
and
so
*NL*
rational
,
as
to
banish
all
doubt
and
convince
them
that
he
was
sound
of
*NL*
mind
.
The
curate
turned
them
all
out
,
and
left
alone
with
him
confessed
*NL*
him
.
The
bachelor
went
for
the
notary
and
returned
shortly
afterwards
*NL*
with
him
and
with
Sancho
,
who
,
having
already
learned
from
the
bachelor
*NL*
the
condition
his
master
was
in
,
and
finding
the
housekeeper
and
niece
*NL*
weeping
,
began
to
blubber
and
shed
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
confession
over
,
the
curate
came
out
saying
,
``
Alonso
Quixano
the
Good
*NL*
is
indeed
dying
,
and
is
indeed
in
his
right
mind
;
we
may
now
go
in
to
him
*NL*
while
he
makes
his
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
news
gave
a
tremendous
impulse
to
the
brimming
eyes
of
the
*NL*
housekeeper
,
niece
,
and
Sancho
Panza
his
good
squire
,
making
the
tears
*NL*
burst
from
their
eyes
and
a
host
of
sighs
from
their
hearts
;
for
of
a
*NL*
truth
,
as
has
been
said
more
than
once
,
whether
as
plain
Alonso
Quixano
*NL*
the
Good
,
or
as
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
Don
Quixote
was
always
of
a
*NL*
gentle
disposition
and
kindly
in
all
his
ways
,
and
hence
he
was
beloved
,
*NL*
not
only
by
those
of
his
own
house
,
but
by
all
who
knew
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
notary
came
in
with
the
rest
,
and
as
soon
as
the
preamble
of
the
will
had
*NL*
been
set
out
and
Don
Quixote
had
commended
his
soul
to
God
with
all
the
*NL*
devout
formalities
that
are
usual
,
coming
to
the
bequests
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Item
,
it
is
my
will

certain

in
the
hands
of
Sancho
*NL*
Panza
-LRB-
whom
in
my
madness
I
made
my
squire
-RRB-
,
inasmuch
as
between
him
and
*NL*
me
there
have
been
certain
accounts
and
debits
and
credits
,
no
claim
be
*NL*
made
against
him
,
nor
any
account
demanded
of
him
in
respect
of
them
;
but
*NL*
that
if
anything
remain
over
and
above
,
after
he
has
paid
himself
what
I
*NL*
owe
him
,
the
balance
,
which
will
be
but
little
,
shall
be
his
,
and
much
*NL*
good
may
it
do
him
;
and
if
,
as
when
I
was
mad
I
had
a
share
in
giving
him
*NL*
the
government
of
an
island
,
so
,
now
that
I
am
in
my
senses
,
I
could
give
*NL*
him
that
of
a
kingdom
,
it
should
be
his
,
for
the
simplicity
of
his
*NL*
character
and
the
fidelity
of
his
conduct
deserve
it
.
''
And
then
,
turning
*NL*
to
Sancho
,
he
said
,
``
Forgive
me
,
my
friend
,
that
I
led
thee
to
seem
as
*NL*
mad
as
myself
,
making
thee
fall
into
the
same
error
I
myself
fell
into
,
*NL*
that
there
were
and
still
are
knights-errant
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Sancho
weeping
,
``
do
n't
die
,
master
,
but
take
my
advice
and
*NL*
live
many
years
;
for
the
foolishest
thing
a
man
can
do
in
this
life
is
to
*NL*
let
himself
die
without
rhyme
or
reason
,
without
anybody
killing
him
,
or
*NL*
any
hands
but
melancholy
's
making
an
end
of
him
.
Come
,
do
n't
be
lazy
,
but
*NL*
get
up
from
your
bed
and
let
us
take
to
the
fields
in
shepherd
's
trim
as
*NL*
we
agreed
.
Perhaps
behind
some
bush
we
shall
find
the
lady
Dulcinea
*NL*
disenchanted
,
as
fine
as
fine
can
be
.
If
it
be
that
you
are
dying
of
*NL*
vexation
at
having
been
vanquished
,
lay
the
blame
on
me
,
and
say
you
were
*NL*
overthrown
because
I
had
girthed
Rocinante
badly
;
besides
you
must
have
*NL*
seen
in
your
books
of
chivalry
that
it
is
a
common
thing
for
knights
to
*NL*
upset
one
another
,
and
for
him
who
is
conquered
to-day
to
be
conqueror
*NL*
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
''
said
Samson
,
``
and
good
Sancho
Panza
's
view
of
these
cases
is
*NL*
quite
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sirs
,
not
so
fast
,
''
said
Don
Quixote
,
''
`
in
last
year
's
nests
there
are
*NL*
no
birds
this
year
.
'
I
was
mad
,
now
I
am
in
my
senses
;
I
was
Don
Quixote
*NL*
of
La
Mancha
,
I
am
now
,
as
I
said
,
Alonso
Quixano
the
Good
;
and
may
my
*NL*
repentance
and
sincerity
restore
me
to
the
esteem
you
used
to
have
for
*NL*
me
;
and
now
let
Master
Notary
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Item
,
I
leave
all
my
property
absolutely
to
Antonia
Quixana
my
niece
,
*NL*
here
present
,
after
all
has
been
deducted
from
the
most
available
portion
*NL*
of
it
that
may
be
required
to
satisfy
the
bequests
I
have
made
.
And
the
*NL*
first
disbursement
I
desire
to
be
made
is
the
payment
of
the
wages
I
owe
*NL*
for
the
time
my
housekeeper
has
served
me
,
with
twenty
ducats
,
over
and
*NL*
above
,
for
a
gown
.
The
curate
and
the
bachelor
Samson
Carrasco
,
now
*NL*
present
,
I
appoint
my
executors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Item
,
it
is
my
wish
that
if
Antonia
Quixana
,
my
niece
,
desires
to
marry
,
*NL*
she
shall
marry
a
man
of
whom
it
shall
be
first
of
all
ascertained
by
*NL*
information
taken
that
he
does
not
know
what
books
of
chivalry
are
;
and
*NL*
if
it
should
be
proved
that
he
does
,
and
if
,
in
spite
of
this
,
my
niece
*NL*
insists
upon
marrying
him
,
and
does
marry
him
,
then
that
she
shall
*NL*
forfeit
the
whole
of
what
I
have
left
her
,
which
my
executors
shall
*NL*
devote
to
works
of
charity
as
they
please
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Item
,
I
entreat
the
aforesaid
gentlemen
my
executors
,
that
,
if
any
happy
*NL*
chance
should
lead
them
to
discover
the
author
who
is
said
to
have
*NL*
written
a
history
now
going
about
under
the
title
of
`
Second
Part
of
the
*NL*
Achievements
of
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
'
they
beg
of
him
on
my
behalf
*NL*
as
earnestly
as
they
can
to
forgive
me
for
having
been
,
without
intending
*NL*
it
,
the
cause
of
his
writing
so
many
and
such
monstrous
absurdities
as
he
*NL*
has
written
in
it
;
for
I
am
leaving
the
world
with
a
feeling
of
*NL*
compunction
at
having
provoked
him
to
write
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
he
closed
his
will
,
and
a
faintness
coming
over
him
he
*NL*
stretched
himself
out
at
full
length
on
the
bed
.
All
were
in
a
flutter
*NL*
and
made
haste
to
relieve
him
,
and
during
the
three
days
he
lived
after
*NL*
that
on
which
he
made
his
will
he
fainted
away
very
often
.
The
house
was
*NL*
all
in
confusion
;
but
still
the
niece
ate
and
the
housekeeper
drank
and
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
enjoyed
himself
;
for
inheriting
property
wipes
out
or
*NL*
softens
down
in
the
heir
the
feeling
of
grief
the
dead
man
might
be
*NL*
expected
to
leave
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Don
Quixote
's
end
came
,
after
he
had
received
all
the
sacraments
,
*NL*
and
had
in
full
and
forcible
terms
expressed
his
detestation
of
books
of
*NL*
chivalry
.
The
notary
was
there
at
the
time
,
and
he
said
that
in
no
book
*NL*
of
chivalry
had
he
ever
read
of
any
knight-errant
dying
in
his
bed
so
*NL*
calmly
and
so
like
a
Christian
as
Don
Quixote
,
who
amid
the
tears
and
*NL*
lamentations
of
all
present
yielded
up
his
spirit
,
that
is
to
say
died
.
*NL*
On
perceiving
it
the
curate
begged
the
notary
to
bear
witness
that
Alonso
*NL*
Quixano
the
Good
,
commonly
called
Don
Quixote
of
La
Mancha
,
had
passed
*NL*
away
from
this
present
life
,
and
died
naturally
;
and
said
he
desired
this
*NL*
testimony
in
order
to
remove
the
possibility
of
any
other
author
save
*NL*
Cide
Hamete
Benengeli
bringing
him
to
life
again
falsely
and
making
*NL*
interminable
stories
out
of
his
achievements
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
end
of
the
Ingenious
Gentleman
of
La
Mancha
,
whose
village
*NL*
Cide
Hamete
would
not
indicate
precisely
,
in
order
to
leave
all
the
towns
*NL*
and
villages
of
La
Mancha
to
contend
among
themselves
for
the
right
to
*NL*
adopt
him
and
claim
him
as
a
son
,
as
the
seven
cities
of
Greece
contended
*NL*
for
Homer
.
The
lamentations
of
Sancho
and
the
niece
and
housekeeper
are
*NL*
omitted
here
,
as
well
as
the
new
epitaphs
upon
his
tomb
;
Samson
Carrasco
,
*NL*
however
,
put
the
following
lines
:
*NL*
*NL*
A
doughty
gentleman
lies
here
;
*NL*
A
stranger
all
his
life
to
fear
;
*NL*
Nor
in
his
death
could
Death
prevail
,
*NL*
In
that
last
hour
,
to
make
him
quail
.
*NL*
He
for
the
world
but
little
cared
;
*NL*
And
at
his
feats
the
world
was
scared
;
*NL*
A
crazy
man
his
life
he
passed
,
*NL*
But
in
his
senses
died
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
said
most
sage
Cide
Hamete
to
his
pen
,
``
Rest
here
,
hung
up
by
this
*NL*
brass
wire
,
upon
this
shelf
,
O
my
pen
,
whether
of
skilful
make
or
clumsy
*NL*
cut
I
know
not
;
here
shalt
thou
remain
long
ages
hence
,
unless
*NL*
presumptuous
or
malignant
story-tellers
take
thee
down
to
profane
thee
.
*NL*
But
ere
they
touch
thee
warn
them
,
and
,
as
best
thou
canst
,
say
to
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
Hold
off
!
ye
weaklings
;
hold
your
hands
!
*NL*
Adventure
it
let
none
,
*NL*
For
this
emprise
,
my
lord
the
king
,
*NL*
Was
meant
for
me
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
me
alone
was
Don
Quixote
born
,
and
I
for
him
;
it
was
his
to
act
,
mine
*NL*
to
write
;
we
two
together
make
but
one
,
notwithstanding
and
in
spite
of
*NL*
that
pretended
Tordesillesque
writer
who
has
ventured
or
would
venture
*NL*
with
his
great
,
coarse
,
ill-trimmed
ostrich
quill
to
write
the
*NL*
achievements
of
my
valiant
knight
;
--
no
burden
for
his
shoulders
,
nor
*NL*
subject
for
his
frozen
wit
:
whom
,
if
perchance
thou
shouldst
come
to
know
*NL*
him
,
thou
shalt
warn
to
leave
at
rest
where
they
lie
the
weary
mouldering
*NL*
bones
of
Don
Quixote
,
and
not
to
attempt
to
carry
him
off
,
in
opposition
*NL*
to
all
the
privileges
of
death
,
to
Old
Castile
,
making
him
rise
from
the
*NL*
grave
where
in
reality
and
truth
he
lies
stretched
at
full
length
,
*NL*
powerless
to
make
any
third
expedition
or
new
sally
;
for
the
two
that
he
*NL*
has
already
made
,
so
much
to
the
enjoyment
and
approval
of
everybody
to
*NL*
whom
they
have
become
known
,
in
this
as
well
as
in
foreign
countries
,
are
*NL*
quite
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
turning
into
ridicule
the
whole
of
*NL*
those
made
by
the
whole
set
of
the
knights-errant
;
and
so
doing
shalt
*NL*
thou
discharge
thy
Christian
calling
,
giving
good
counsel
to
one
that
*NL*
bears
ill-will
to
thee
.
And
I
shall
remain
satisfied
,
and
proud
to
have
*NL*
been
the
first
who
has
ever
enjoyed
the
fruit
of
his
writings
as
fully
as
*NL*
he
could
desire
;
for
my
desire
has
been
no
other
than
to
deliver
over
to
*NL*
the
detestation
of
mankind
the
false
and
foolish
tales
of
the
books
of
*NL*
chivalry
,
which
,
thanks
to
that
of
my
true
Don
Quixote
,
are
even
now
*NL*
tottering
,
and
doubtless
doomed
to
fall
for
ever
.
Farewell
