THE
PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
is
the
creator
of
beautiful
things
.
To
reveal
art
and
*NL*
conceal
the
artist
is
art
's
aim
.
The
critic
is
he
who
can
translate
*NL*
into
another
manner
or
a
new
material
his
impression
of
beautiful
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
highest
as
the
lowest
form
of
criticism
is
a
mode
of
autobiography
.
*NL*
Those
who
find
ugly
meanings
in
beautiful
things
are
corrupt
without
*NL*
being
charming
.
This
is
a
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
find
beautiful
meanings
in
beautiful
things
are
the
*NL*
cultivated
.
For
these
there
is
hope
.
They
are
the
elect
to
whom
*NL*
beautiful
things
mean
only
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
moral
or
an
immoral
book
.
Books
are
well
*NL*
written
,
or
badly
written
.
That
is
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nineteenth
century
dislike
of
realism
is
the
rage
of
Caliban
seeing
*NL*
his
own
face
in
a
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nineteenth
century
dislike
of
romanticism
is
the
rage
of
Caliban
*NL*
not
seeing
his
own
face
in
a
glass
.
The
moral
life
of
man
forms
part
*NL*
of
the
subject-matter
of
the
artist
,
but
the
morality
of
art
consists
*NL*
in
the
perfect
use
of
an
imperfect
medium
.
No
artist
desires
to
prove
*NL*
anything
.
Even
things
that
are
true
can
be
proved
.
No
artist
has
*NL*
ethical
sympathies
.
An
ethical
sympathy
in
an
artist
is
an
*NL*
unpardonable
mannerism
of
style
.
No
artist
is
ever
morbid
.
The
artist
*NL*
can
express
everything
.
Thought
and
language
are
to
the
artist
*NL*
instruments
of
an
art
.
Vice
and
virtue
are
to
the
artist
materials
for
*NL*
an
art
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
form
,
the
type
of
all
the
arts
is
*NL*
the
art
of
the
musician
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
feeling
,
the
*NL*
actor
's
craft
is
the
type
.
All
art
is
at
once
surface
and
symbol
.
*NL*
Those
who
go
beneath
the
surface
do
so
at
their
peril
.
Those
who
read
*NL*
the
symbol
do
so
at
their
peril
.
It
is
the
spectator
,
and
not
life
,
*NL*
that
art
really
mirrors
.
Diversity
of
opinion
about
a
work
of
art
*NL*
shows
that
the
work
is
new
,
complex
,
and
vital
.
When
critics
disagree
,
*NL*
the
artist
is
in
accord
with
himself
.
We
can
forgive
a
man
for
making
*NL*
a
useful
thing
as
long
as
he
does
not
admire
it
.
The
only
excuse
for
*NL*
making
a
useless
thing
is
that
one
admires
it
intensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
art
is
quite
useless
.

CHAPTER
1
*NL*
*NL*
The
studio
was
filled
with
the
rich
odour
of
roses
,
and
when
the
light
*NL*
summer
wind
stirred
amidst
the
trees
of
the
garden
,
there
came
through
*NL*
the
open
door
the
heavy
scent
of
the
lilac
,
or
the
more
delicate
*NL*
perfume
of
the
pink-flowering
thorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
corner
of
the
divan
of
Persian
saddle-bags
on
which
he
was
*NL*
lying
,
smoking
,
as
was
his
custom
,
innumerable
cigarettes
,
Lord
Henry
*NL*
Wotton
could
just
catch
the
gleam
of
the
honey-sweet
and
honey-coloured
*NL*
blossoms
of
a
laburnum
,
whose
tremulous
branches
seemed
hardly
able
to
*NL*
bear
the
burden
of
a
beauty
so
flamelike
as
theirs
;
and
now
and
then
*NL*
the
fantastic
shadows
of
birds
in
flight
flitted
across
the
long
*NL*
tussore-silk
curtains
that
were
stretched
in
front
of
the
huge
window
,
*NL*
producing
a
kind
of
momentary
Japanese
effect
,
and
making
him
think
of
*NL*
those
pallid
,
jade-faced
painters
of
Tokyo
who
,
through
the
medium
of
*NL*
an
art
that
is
necessarily
immobile
,
seek
to
convey
the
sense
of
*NL*
swiftness
and
motion
.
The
sullen
murmur
of
the
bees
shouldering
their
*NL*
way
through
the
long
unmown
grass
,
or
circling
with
monotonous
*NL*
insistence
round
the
dusty
gilt
horns
of
the
straggling
woodbine
,
*NL*
seemed
to
make
the
stillness
more
oppressive
.
The
dim
roar
of
London
*NL*
was
like
the
bourdon
note
of
a
distant
organ
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
centre
of
the
room
,
clamped
to
an
upright
easel
,
stood
the
*NL*
full-length
portrait
of
a
young
man
of
extraordinary
personal
beauty
,
*NL*
and
in
front
of
it
,
some
little
distance
away
,
was
sitting
the
artist
*NL*
himself
,
Basil
Hallward
,
whose
sudden
disappearance
some
years
ago
*NL*
caused
,
at
the
time
,
such
public
excitement
and
gave
rise
to
so
many
*NL*
strange
conjectures
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
painter
looked
at
the
gracious
and
comely
form
he
had
so
*NL*
skilfully
mirrored
in
his
art
,
a
smile
of
pleasure
passed
across
his
*NL*
face
,
and
seemed
about
to
linger
there
.
But
he
suddenly
started
up
,
*NL*
and
closing
his
eyes
,
placed
his
fingers
upon
the
lids
,
as
though
he
*NL*
sought
to
imprison
within
his
brain
some
curious
dream
from
which
he
*NL*
feared
he
might
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
your
best
work
,
Basil
,
the
best
thing
you
have
ever
done
,
''
said
*NL*
Lord
Henry
languidly
.
``
You
must
certainly
send
it
next
year
to
the
*NL*
Grosvenor
.
The
Academy
is
too
large
and
too
vulgar
.
Whenever
I
have
*NL*
gone
there
,
there
have
been
either
so
many
people
that
I
have
not
been
*NL*
able
to
see
the
pictures
,
which
was
dreadful
,
or
so
many
pictures
that
*NL*
I
have
not
been
able
to
see
the
people
,
which
was
worse
.
The
Grosvenor
*NL*
is
really
the
only
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
send
it
anywhere
,
''
he
answered
,
tossing
his
head
*NL*
back
in
that
odd
way
that
used
to
make
his
friends
laugh
at
him
at
*NL*
Oxford
.
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
send
it
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
elevated
his
eyebrows
and
looked
at
him
in
amazement
through
*NL*
the
thin
blue
wreaths
of
smoke
that
curled
up
in
such
fanciful
whorls
*NL*
from
his
heavy
,
opium-tainted
cigarette
.
``
Not
send
it
anywhere
?
My
*NL*
dear
fellow
,
why
?
Have
you
any
reason
?
What
odd
chaps
you
painters
*NL*
are
!
You
do
anything
in
the
world
to
gain
a
reputation
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
you
have
one
,
you
seem
to
want
to
throw
it
away
.
It
is
silly
of
you
,
*NL*
for
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
worse
than
being
talked
about
,
*NL*
and
that
is
not
being
talked
about
.
A
portrait
like
this
would
set
you
*NL*
far
above
all
the
young
men
in
England
,
and
make
the
old
men
quite
*NL*
jealous
,
if
old
men
are
ever
capable
of
any
emotion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
will
laugh
at
me
,
''
he
replied
,
``
but
I
really
ca
n't
exhibit
*NL*
it
.
I
have
put
too
much
of
myself
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
stretched
himself
out
on
the
divan
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
knew
you
would
;
but
it
is
quite
true
,
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
much
of
yourself
in
it
!
Upon
my
word
,
Basil
,
I
did
n't
know
you
*NL*
were
so
vain
;
and
I
really
ca
n't
see
any
resemblance
between
you
,
with
*NL*
your
rugged
strong
face
and
your
coal-black
hair
,
and
this
young
*NL*
Adonis
,
who
looks
as
if
he
was
made
out
of
ivory
and
rose-leaves
.
Why
,
*NL*
my
dear
Basil
,
he
is
a
Narcissus
,
and
you
--
well
,
of
course
you
have
an
*NL*
intellectual
expression
and
all
that
.
But
beauty
,
real
beauty
,
ends
*NL*
where
an
intellectual
expression
begins
.
Intellect
is
in
itself
a
mode
*NL*
of
exaggeration
,
and
destroys
the
harmony
of
any
face
.
The
moment
one
*NL*
sits
down
to
think
,
one
becomes
all
nose
,
or
all
forehead
,
or
something
*NL*
horrid
.
Look
at
the
successful
men
in
any
of
the
learned
professions
.
*NL*
How
perfectly
hideous
they
are
!
Except
,
of
course
,
in
the
Church
.
But
*NL*
then
in
the
Church
they
do
n't
think
.
A
bishop
keeps
on
saying
at
the
*NL*
age
of
eighty
what
he
was
told
to
say
when
he
was
a
boy
of
eighteen
,
*NL*
and
as
a
natural
consequence
he
always
looks
absolutely
delightful
.
*NL*
Your
mysterious
young
friend
,
whose
name
you
have
never
told
me
,
but
*NL*
whose
picture
really
fascinates
me
,
never
thinks
.
I
feel
quite
sure
of
*NL*
that
.
He
is
some
brainless
beautiful
creature
who
should
be
always
*NL*
here
in
winter
when
we
have
no
flowers
to
look
at
,
and
always
here
in
*NL*
summer
when
we
want
something
to
chill
our
intelligence
.
Do
n't
flatter
*NL*
yourself
,
Basil
:
you
are
not
in
the
least
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
understand
me
,
Harry
,
''
answered
the
artist
.
``
Of
course
I
am
*NL*
not
like
him
.
I
know
that
perfectly
well
.
Indeed
,
I
should
be
sorry
*NL*
to
look
like
him
.
You
shrug
your
shoulders
?
I
am
telling
you
the
*NL*
truth
.
There
is
a
fatality
about
all
physical
and
intellectual
*NL*
distinction
,
the
sort
of
fatality
that
seems
to
dog
through
history
the
*NL*
faltering
steps
of
kings
.
It
is
better
not
to
be
different
from
one
's
*NL*
fellows
.
The
ugly
and
the
stupid
have
the
best
of
it
in
this
world
.
*NL*
They
can
sit
at
their
ease
and
gape
at
the
play
.
If
they
know
nothing
*NL*
of
victory
,
they
are
at
least
spared
the
knowledge
of
defeat
.
They
*NL*
live
as
we
all
should
live
--
undisturbed
,
indifferent
,
and
without
*NL*
disquiet
.
They
neither
bring
ruin
upon
others
,
nor
ever
receive
it
*NL*
from
alien
hands
.
Your
rank
and
wealth
,
Harry
;
my
brains
,
such
as
they
*NL*
are
--
my
art
,
whatever
it
may
be
worth
;
Dorian
Gray
's
good
looks
--
we
*NL*
shall
all
suffer
for
what
the
gods
have
given
us
,
suffer
terribly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
Gray
?
Is
that
his
name
?
''
asked
Lord
Henry
,
walking
across
the
*NL*
studio
towards
Basil
Hallward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
his
name
.
I
did
n't
intend
to
tell
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
explain
.
When
I
like
people
immensely
,
I
never
tell
their
*NL*
names
to
any
one
.
It
is
like
surrendering
a
part
of
them
.
I
have
*NL*
grown
to
love
secrecy
.
It
seems
to
be
the
one
thing
that
can
make
*NL*
modern
life
mysterious
or
marvellous
to
us
.
The
commonest
thing
is
*NL*
delightful
if
one
only
hides
it
.
When
I
leave
town
now
I
never
tell
my
*NL*
people
where
I
am
going
.
If
I
did
,
I
would
lose
all
my
pleasure
.
It
*NL*
is
a
silly
habit
,
I
dare
say
,
but
somehow
it
seems
to
bring
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
romance
into
one
's
life
.
I
suppose
you
think
me
awfully
*NL*
foolish
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
answered
Lord
Henry
,
``
not
at
all
,
my
dear
Basil
.
You
*NL*
seem
to
forget
that
I
am
married
,
and
the
one
charm
of
marriage
is
that
*NL*
it
makes
a
life
of
deception
absolutely
necessary
for
both
parties
.
I
*NL*
never
know
where
my
wife
is
,
and
my
wife
never
knows
what
I
am
doing
.
*NL*
When
we
meet
--
we
do
meet
occasionally
,
when
we
dine
out
together
,
or
go
*NL*
down
to
the
Duke
's
--
we
tell
each
other
the
most
absurd
stories
with
the
*NL*
most
serious
faces
.
My
wife
is
very
good
at
it
--
much
better
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
than
I
am
.
She
never
gets
confused
over
her
dates
,
and
I
always
do
.
*NL*
But
when
she
does
find
me
out
,
she
makes
no
row
at
all
.
I
sometimes
*NL*
wish
she
would
;
but
she
merely
laughs
at
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
the
way
you
talk
about
your
married
life
,
Harry
,
''
said
Basil
*NL*
Hallward
,
strolling
towards
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden
.
``
I
*NL*
believe
that
you
are
really
a
very
good
husband
,
but
that
you
are
*NL*
thoroughly
ashamed
of
your
own
virtues
.
You
are
an
extraordinary
*NL*
fellow
.
You
never
say
a
moral
thing
,
and
you
never
do
a
wrong
thing
.
*NL*
Your
cynicism
is
simply
a
pose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
natural
is
simply
a
pose
,
and
the
most
irritating
pose
I
know
,
''
*NL*
cried
Lord
Henry
,
laughing
;
and
the
two
young
men
went
out
into
the
*NL*
garden
together
and
ensconced
themselves
on
a
long
bamboo
seat
that
*NL*
stood
in
the
shade
of
a
tall
laurel
bush
.
The
sunlight
slipped
over
*NL*
the
polished
leaves
.
In
the
grass
,
white
daisies
were
tremulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
,
Lord
Henry
pulled
out
his
watch
.
``
I
am
afraid
I
must
be
*NL*
going
,
Basil
,
''
he
murmured
,
``
and
before
I
go
,
I
insist
on
your
*NL*
answering

question

put
to
you
some
time
ago

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that

said
the
painter
,
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

there
was
too
much
of
*NL*
yourself
in
it
.
Now
,
that
is
childish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harry
,
''
said
Basil
Hallward
,
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
,
``
every
*NL*
portrait
that
is
painted
with
feeling
is
a
portrait
of
the
artist
,
not
*NL*
of
the
sitter
.
The
sitter
is
merely
the
accident
,
the
occasion
.
It
is
*NL*
not
he
who
is
revealed
by
the
painter
;
it
is
rather
the
painter
who
,
on
*NL*
the
coloured
canvas
,
reveals
himself
.
The
reason
I
will
not
exhibit
*NL*
this
picture
is
that
I
am
afraid
that
I
have
shown
in
it
the
secret
of
*NL*
my
own
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
laughed
.
``
And
what
is
that
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
,
''
said
Hallward
;
but
an
expression
of
perplexity
came
*NL*
over
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
all
expectation
,
Basil
,
''
continued
his
companion
,
glancing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
is
really
very
little
to
tell
,
Harry
,
''
answered
the
painter
;
*NL*
``
and
I
am
afraid
you
will
hardly
understand
it
.
Perhaps
you
will
*NL*
hardly
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
smiled
,
and
leaning
down
,
plucked
a
pink-petalled
daisy
from
*NL*
the
grass
and
examined
it
.
``
I
am
quite
sure
I
shall
understand
it
,
''
he
*NL*
replied
,
gazing
intently
at
the
little
golden
,
white-feathered
disk
,
*NL*
``
and
as
for
believing
things
,
I
can
believe
anything
,
provided
that
it
*NL*
is
quite
incredible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
shook
some
blossoms
from
the
trees
,
and
the
heavy
*NL*
lilac-blooms
,
with
their
clustering
stars
,
moved
to
and
fro
in
the
*NL*
languid
air
.
A
grasshopper
began
to
chirrup
by
the
wall
,
and
like
a
*NL*
blue
thread
a
long
thin
dragon-fly
floated
past
on
its
brown
gauze
*NL*
wings
.
Lord
Henry
felt
as
if
he
could
hear
Basil
Hallward
's
heart
*NL*
beating
,
and
wondered
what
was
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
story
is
simply
this
,
''
said
the
painter
after
some
time
.
``
Two
*NL*
months
ago
I
went
to
a
crush
at
Lady
Brandon
's
.
You
know
we
poor
*NL*
artists
have
to
show
ourselves
in
society
from
time
to
time
,
just
to
*NL*
remind
the
public
that
we
are
not
savages
.
With
an
evening
coat
and
a
*NL*
white
tie
,
as
you
told
me
once
,
anybody
,
even
a
stock-broker
,
can
gain
*NL*
a
reputation
for
being
civilized
.
Well
,
after
I
had
been
in
the
room
*NL*
about
ten
minutes
,
talking
to
huge
overdressed
dowagers
and
tedious
*NL*
academicians
,
I
suddenly
became
conscious
that
some
one
was
looking
at
*NL*
me
.
I
turned
half-way
round
and
saw
Dorian
Gray
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
When
our
eyes
met
,
I
felt
that
I
was
growing
pale
.
A
curious
sensation
*NL*
of
terror
came
over
me
.
I
knew
that
I
had
come
face
to
face
with
some
*NL*
one
whose
mere
personality
was
so
fascinating
that
,
if
I
allowed
it
to
*NL*
do
so
,
it
would
absorb
my
whole
nature
,
my
whole
soul
,
my
very
art
*NL*
itself
.
I
did
not
want
any
external
influence
in
my
life
.
You
know
*NL*
yourself
,
Harry
,
how
independent
I
am
by
nature
.
I
have
always
been
my
*NL*
own
master
;
had
at
least
always
been
so
,
till
I
met
Dorian
Gray
.
*NL*
Then
--
but
I
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
to
you
.
Something
seemed
to
*NL*
tell
me
that
I
was
on
the
verge
of
a
terrible
crisis
in
my
life
.
I
had
*NL*
a
strange
feeling
that
fate
had
in
store
for
me
exquisite
joys
and
*NL*
exquisite
sorrows
.
I
grew
afraid
and
turned
to
quit
the
room
.
It
was
*NL*
not
conscience
that
made
me
do
so
:
it
was
a
sort
of
cowardice
.
I
take
*NL*
no
credit
to
myself
for
trying
to
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Conscience
and
cowardice
are
really
the
same
things
,
Basil
.
*NL*
Conscience
is
the
trade-name
of
the
firm
.
That
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
that
,
Harry
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
you
do
either
.
*NL*
However
,
whatever
was
my
motive
--
and
it
may
have
been
pride
,
for
I
used
*NL*
to
be
very
proud
--
I
certainly
struggled
to
the
door
.
There
,
of
course
,
*NL*
I
stumbled
against
Lady
Brandon
.
`
You
are
not
going
to
run
away
so
*NL*
soon
,
Mr.
Hallward
?
'
she
screamed
out
.
You
know
her
curiously
shrill
*NL*
voice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
she
is
a
peacock
in
everything
but
beauty
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
*NL*
pulling
the
daisy
to
bits
with
his
long
nervous
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
get
rid
of
her
.
She
brought
me
up
to
royalties
,
and
*NL*
people
with
stars
and
garters
,
and
elderly
ladies
with
gigantic
tiaras
*NL*
and
parrot
noses
.
She
spoke
of
me
as
her
dearest
friend
.
I
had
only
*NL*
met
her
once
before
,
but
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
lionize
me
.
I
*NL*
believe
some
picture
of
mine
had
made
a
great
success
at
the
time
,
at
*NL*
least
had
been
chattered
about
in
the
penny
newspapers
,
which
is
the
*NL*
nineteenth-century
standard
of
immortality
.
Suddenly
I
found
myself
*NL*
face
to
face
with
the
young
man
whose
personality
had
so
strangely
*NL*
stirred
me
.
We
were
quite
close
,
almost
touching
.
Our
eyes
met
again
.
*NL*
It
was
reckless
of
me
,
but
I
asked
Lady
Brandon
to
introduce
me
to
him
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
not
so
reckless
,
after
all
.
It
was
simply
inevitable
.
*NL*
We
would
have
spoken
to
each
other
without
any
introduction
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
of
that
.
Dorian
told
me
so
afterwards
.
He
,
too
,
felt
that
we
were
*NL*
destined
to
know
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
Lady
Brandon
describe
this
wonderful
young
man
?
''
asked
his
*NL*
companion
.
``
I
know
she
goes
in
for
giving
a
rapid
_
precis

of
all
her
*NL*
guests

I
remember
her
bringing
me
up
to
a
truculent
and
red-faced
old
*NL*
gentleman
covered
all
over
with
orders
and
ribbons
,
and
hissing
into
my
*NL*
ear
,
in
a
tragic
whisper
which
must
have
been
perfectly
audible
to
*NL*
everybody
in
the
room
,
the
most
astounding
details

I
simply
fled
.
I
*NL*
like
to
find
out
people
for
myself
.
But
Lady
Brandon
treats
her
guests
*NL*
exactly
as
an
auctioneer
treats
his
goods
.
She
either
explains
them
*NL*
entirely
away

tells
one
everything
about
them

what
one
wants

to
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Lady
Brandon

You
are
hard

Hallward

listlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
she
tried
to
found
a

only
succeeded

How
could
I
admire
her

But
tell

she
say
about
Mr.

Neither

help
laughing

we

*NL*
``

the
young

plucking
another
daisy

Hallward
shook

head

are
indifferent

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
horribly
unjust
of
you

cried
Lord
Henry
,
tilting
his
hat
back
*NL*
and
looking
up
at
the
little
clouds
that
,
like
ravelled
skeins
of
*NL*
glossy
white
silk

were
drifting
across
the
hollowed
turquoise
of
the
*NL*
summer
sky

``
Yes

horribly
unjust
of
you

I
make
a
great
difference

between

I
choose

their
good
looks
,
my
*NL*
acquaintances
for
their
good
characters

and
my
enemies

A

careful

I
have
not

one

intellectual
power

consequently
they

appreciate

Is
that

very

of

I
think
it

rather
vain

*NL*

``

exclaimed
Hallward

frowning

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
I
am
not
quite
serious
.
But
I
ca
n't
help
detesting
my
*NL*
relations

I
suppose
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
none
of
us
can
stand
*NL*
other
people
having
the
same
faults
as
ourselves
.
I
quite
sympathize
*NL*
with
the
rage
of
the
English
democracy
against
what
they
call
the
vices
*NL*
of
the
upper
orders
.
The
masses
feel
that
drunkenness
,
stupidity

and
*NL*
immorality
should
be
their
own
special
property
,
and
that
if
any
one
of
*NL*
us
makes
an
ass
of
himself

he
is
poaching
on
their
preserves

When
*NL*
poor
Southwark
got
into
the
divorce
court

their
indignation
was
quite
*NL*
magnificent

And
yet
I
do
n't
suppose

ten
per

correctly

``
I
do

a
single
word

you
have
said

what
is

more

Harry

I
feel
sure
you
do

either

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
stroked
his
pointed
brown
beard
and
tapped
the
toe
of
his
*NL*
patent-leather
boot
with
a
tasselled
ebony
cane
.
``
How
English
you
are
*NL*
Basil
!
That
is
the
second
time
you
have
made
that
observation
.
If
one
*NL*
puts
forward
an
idea
to
a
true
Englishman
--
always
a
rash
thing
to
*NL*
do
--
he
never
dreams
of
considering
whether
the
idea
is
right
or
wrong
.
*NL*
The
only
thing
he
considers
of
any
importance
is
whether
one
believes
*NL*
it
oneself
.
Now
,
the
value
of
an
idea
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
*NL*
with
the
sincerity
of
the
man
who
expresses
it
.
Indeed
,
the
*NL*
probabilities
are
that
the
more
insincere
the
man
is
,
the
more
purely
*NL*
intellectual
will
the
idea
be
,
as
in
that
case
it
will
not
be
coloured
*NL*
by
either
his
wants
,
his
desires
,
or
his
prejudices

However
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
propose
to
discuss
politics
,
sociology
,
or
metaphysics
with
you

I
*NL*
like
persons
better
than
principles

and
I
like
persons
with
no
*NL*
principles
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world

Tell
me
more
about
*NL*
Mr.
Dorian
Gray
.
How
often
do
you
see
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
day

I
could
n't
be
happy
if
I
did
n't
see
him
every
day

He
is
*NL*
absolutely
necessary
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
extraordinary
!
I
thought
you
would
never
care
for
anything
but
*NL*
your
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
all
my
art
to
me
now
,
''
said
the
painter
gravely
.
``
I
sometimes
*NL*
think
,
Harry
,
that
there
are
only
two
eras
of
any
importance
in
the
*NL*
world
's
history
.
The
first
is
the
appearance
of
a
new
medium
for
art
,
*NL*
and
the
second
is
the
appearance
of
a
new
personality
for
art
also
.
*NL*
What
the
invention
of
oil-painting
was
to
the
Venetians
,
the
face
of
*NL*
Antinous
was
to
late
Greek
sculpture
,
and
the
face
of
Dorian
Gray
will
*NL*
some
day
be
to
me
.
It
is
not
merely
that
I
paint
from
him
,
draw
from
*NL*
him
,
sketch
from
him
.
Of
course
,
I
have
done
all
that
.
But
he
is
much
*NL*
more
to
me
than
a
model
or
a
sitter
.
I
wo
n't
tell
you
that
I
am
*NL*
dissatisfied
with
what
I
have
done
of
him
,
or
that
his
beauty
is
such
*NL*
that
art
can
not
express
it
.
There
is
nothing
that
art
can
not
express
,
*NL*
and
I
know
that
the
work
I
have
done
,
since
I
met
Dorian
Gray
,
is
good
*NL*
work
,
is
the
best
work
of
my
life
.
But
in
some
curious
way
--
I
wonder
*NL*
will
you
understand
me
?
--
his
personality
has
suggested
to
me
an
*NL*
entirely
new
manner
in
art
,
an
entirely
new
mode
of
style
.
I
see
*NL*
things
differently
,
I
think
of
them
differently
.
I
can
now
recreate
*NL*
life
in
a
way
that
was
hidden
from
me
before
.
'
A
dream
of
form
in
days
*NL*
of
thought
'
--
who
is
it
who
says
that
?
I
forget
;
but
it
is
what
Dorian
*NL*
Gray
has
been
to
me
.
The
merely
visible
presence
of
this
lad
--
for
he
*NL*
seems
to
me
little
more
than
a
lad
,
though
he
is
really
over
*NL*
twenty
--
his
merely
visible
presence
--
ah
!
I
wonder
can
you
realize
all
*NL*
that
that
means
?
Unconsciously
he
defines
for
me
the
lines
of
a
fresh
*NL*
school
,
a
school
that
is
to
have
in
it
all
the
passion
of
the
romantic
*NL*
spirit
,
all
the
perfection
of
the
spirit
that
is
Greek
.
The
harmony
of
*NL*
soul
and
body
--
how
much
that
is
!
We
in
our
madness
have
separated
the
*NL*
two
,
and
have
invented
a
realism
that
is
vulgar
,
an
ideality
that
is
*NL*
void
.
Harry
!
if
you
only
knew
what
Dorian
Gray
is
to
me
!
You
remember
*NL*
that
landscape
of
mine
,
for
which
Agnew
offered
me
such
a
huge
price
*NL*
but
which
I
would
not
part
with
?
It
is
one
of
the
best
things
I
have
*NL*
ever
done
.
And
why
is
it
so
?
Because
,
while
I
was
painting
it
,
Dorian
*NL*
Gray
sat
beside
me
.
Some
subtle
influence
passed
from
him
to
me
,
and
*NL*
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
saw
in
the
plain
woodland
the
wonder
I
*NL*
had
always
looked
for
and
always
missed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Basil
,
this
is
extraordinary
!
I
must
see
Dorian
Gray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
got
up
from
the
seat
and
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
.
After
*NL*
some
time
he
came
back
.
``
Harry
,
''
he
said
,
``
Dorian
Gray
is
to
me
simply
*NL*
a
motive
in
art
.
You
might
see
nothing
in
him
.
I
see
everything
in
*NL*
him
.
He
is
never
more
present
in
my
work
than
when
no
image
of
him
is
*NL*
there
.
He
is
a
suggestion
,
as
I
have
said
,
of
a
new
manner
.
I
find
*NL*
him
in
the
curves
of
certain
lines
,
in
the
loveliness
and
subtleties
of
*NL*
certain
colours
.
That
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
wo
n't
you
exhibit
his
portrait
?
''
asked
Lord
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
without
intending
it
,
I
have
put
into
it
some
expression
of
*NL*
all
this
curious
artistic
idolatry
,
of
which
,
of
course
,
I
have
never
*NL*
cared
to
speak
to
him
.
He
knows
nothing
about
it
.
He
shall
never
know
*NL*
anything
about
it
.
But
the
world
might
guess
it
,
and
I
will
not
bare
*NL*
my
soul
to
their
shallow
prying
eyes
.
My
heart
shall
never
be
put
*NL*
under
their
microscope
.
There
is
too
much
of
myself
in
the
thing
,
*NL*
Harry
--
too
much
of
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poets
are
not
so
scrupulous
as
you
are
.
They
know
how
useful
passion
*NL*
is
for
publication

Nowadays
a
broken
heart
will
run
to
many
editions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
them
for
it
,
''
cried
Hallward
.
``
An
artist
should
create
*NL*
beautiful
things
,
but
should
put
nothing
of
his
own
life
into
them
.
We
*NL*
live
in
an
age
when
men
treat
art
as
if
it
were
meant
to
be
a
form
of
*NL*
autobiography
.
We
have
lost
the
abstract
sense
of
beauty
.
Some
day
I
*NL*
will
show
the
world
what
it
is
;
and
for
that
reason
the
world
shall
*NL*
never
see
my
portrait
of
Dorian
Gray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
wrong
,
Basil
,
but
I
wo
n't
argue
with
you
.
It
is
only
*NL*
the
intellectually
lost
who
ever
argue
.
Tell
me
,
is
Dorian
Gray
very
*NL*
fond
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
considered
for
a
few
moments
.
``
He
likes
me
,
''
he
answered
*NL*
after
a
pause
;
``
I
know
he
likes
me
.
Of
course
I
flatter
him
*NL*
dreadfully
.
I
find
a
strange
pleasure
in
saying
things
to
him
that
I
*NL*
know
I
shall
be
sorry
for
having
said
.
As
a
rule
,
he
is
charming
to
*NL*
me
,
and
we
sit
in
the
studio
and
talk
of
a
thousand
things
.
Now
and
*NL*
then
,
however
,
he
is
horribly
thoughtless
,
and
seems
to
take
a
real
*NL*
delight
in
giving
me
pain
.
Then
I
feel
,
Harry
,
that
I
have
given
away
*NL*
my
whole
soul
to
some
one
who
treats
it
as
if
it
were
a
flower
to
put
*NL*
in
his
coat
,
a
bit
of
decoration
to
charm
his
vanity
,
an
ornament
for
a
*NL*
summer
's
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Days
in
summer
,
Basil
,
are
apt
to
linger
,
''
murmured
Lord
Henry
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
will
tire
sooner
than
he
will
.
It
is
a
sad
thing
to
think
*NL*
of
,
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
genius
lasts
longer
than
beauty
.
That
*NL*
accounts
for
the
fact
that
we
all
take
such
pains
to
over-educate
*NL*
ourselves
.
In
the
wild
struggle
for
existence
,
we
want
to
have
*NL*
something
that
endures
,
and
so
we
fill
our
minds
with
rubbish
and
*NL*
facts
,
in
the
silly
hope
of
keeping
our
place
.
The
thoroughly
*NL*
well-informed
man
--
that
is
the
modern
ideal
.
And
the
mind
of
the
*NL*
thoroughly
well-informed
man
is
a
dreadful
thing
.
It
is
like
a
*NL*
_
bric-a-brac
_
shop
,
all
monsters
and
dust
,
with
everything
priced
above
*NL*
its
proper
value
.
I
think
you
will
tire
first
,
all
the
same
.
Some
day
*NL*
you
will
look
at
your
friend
,
and
he
will
seem
to
you
to
be
a
little
*NL*
out
of
drawing
,
or
you
wo
n't
like
his
tone
of
colour
,
or
something
.
*NL*
You
will
bitterly
reproach
him
in
your
own
heart
,
and
seriously
think
*NL*
that
he
has
behaved
very
badly
to
you
.
The
next
time
he
calls
,
you
*NL*
will
be
perfectly
cold
and
indifferent
.
It
will
be
a
great
pity
,
for
*NL*
it
will
alter
you
.
What
you
have
told
me
is
quite
a
romance
,
a
romance
*NL*
of
art
one
might
call
it
,
and
the
worst
of
having
a
romance
of
any
kind
*NL*
is
that
it
leaves
one
so
unromantic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harry
,
do
n't
talk
like
that
.
As
long
as
I
live
,
the
personality
of
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
will
dominate
me
.
You
ca
n't
feel
what
I
feel

You
change
*NL*
too
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
Basil
,
that
is
exactly
why
I
can
feel
it
.
Those
who
are
*NL*
faithful
know
only
the
trivial
side
of
love
:
it
is
the
faithless
who
*NL*
know
love
's
tragedies
.
''
And
Lord
Henry
struck
a
light
on
a
dainty
*NL*
silver
case
and
began
to
smoke
a
cigarette
with
a
self-conscious
and
*NL*
satisfied
air
,
as
if
he
had
summed
up
the
world
in
a
phrase
.
There
was
*NL*
a
rustle
of
chirruping
sparrows
in
the
green
lacquer
leaves
of
the
ivy
,
*NL*
and
the
blue
cloud-shadows
chased
themselves
across
the
grass
like
*NL*
swallows
.
How
pleasant
it
was
in
the
garden
!
And
how
delightful
other
*NL*
people
's
emotions
were
!
--
much
more
delightful
than
their
ideas
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
.
One
's
own
soul
,
and
the
passions
of
one
's
*NL*
friends
--
those
were
the
fascinating
things
in
life
.
He
pictured
to
*NL*
himself
with
silent
amusement
the
tedious
luncheon
that
he
had
missed
*NL*
by
staying
so
long
with
Basil
Hallward
.
Had
he
gone
to
his
aunt
's
,
he
*NL*
would
have
been
sure
to
have
met
Lord
Goodbody
there
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
conversation
would
have
been
about
the
feeding
of
the
poor
and
the
*NL*
necessity
for
model
lodging-houses
.
Each
class
would
have
preached
the
*NL*
importance
of
those
virtues
,
for
whose
exercise
there
was
no
necessity
*NL*
in
their
own
lives
.
The
rich
would
have
spoken
on
the
value
of
thrift
,
*NL*
and
the
idle
grown
eloquent
over
the
dignity
of
labour
.
It
was
*NL*
charming
to
have
escaped
all
that
!
As
he
thought
of
his
aunt
,
an
idea
*NL*
seemed
to
strike
him
.
He
turned
to
Hallward
and
said
,
``
My
dear
fellow
,
*NL*
I
have
just
remembered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remembered
what
,
Harry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
I
heard
the
name
of
Dorian
Gray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
was
it
?
''
asked
Hallward
,
with
a
slight
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
look
so
angry
,
Basil
.
It
was
at
my
aunt
,
Lady
Agatha
's
.
She
*NL*
told
me
she
had
discovered
a
wonderful
young
man
who
was
going
to
help
*NL*
her
in
the
East
End
,
and
that
his
name
was
Dorian
Gray
.
I
am
bound
to
*NL*
state
that
she
never
told
me
he
was
good-looking
.
Women
have
no
*NL*
appreciation
of
good
looks
;
at
least
,
good
women
have
not
.
She
said
*NL*
that
he
was
very
earnest
and
had
a
beautiful
nature
.
I
at
once
*NL*
pictured
to
myself
a
creature
with
spectacles
and
lank
hair
,
horribly
*NL*
freckled
,
and
tramping
about
on
huge
feet
.
I
wish
I
had
known
it
was
*NL*
your
friend

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Dorian
Gray

said
the
butler
,
coming
into
*NL*
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
introduce
me
now

cried
Lord
Henry
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
turned
to
his
servant
,
who
stood
blinking
in
the
sunlight
.
*NL*
``
Ask
Mr.
Gray
to
wait
,
Parker
:
I
shall
be
in
in
a
few
moments

The
*NL*
man
bowed
and
went
up
the
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
looked
at
Lord
Henry
.
``
Dorian
Gray
is
my
dearest
friend
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
He
has
a
simple
and
a
beautiful
nature

Your
aunt
was
quite
*NL*
right
in
what
she
said
of
him
.
Do
n't
spoil
him

Do
n't
try
to
*NL*
influence
him

Your
influence
would
be
bad

The
world
is
wide
,
and
*NL*
has
many
marvellous
people
in
it

Do
n't
take
away
from
me
the
one
*NL*
person
who
gives
to
my
art
whatever
charm
it
possesses
:
my
life
as
an
*NL*
artist
depends
on
him

Mind
,
Harry
,
I
trust
you

He
spoke
very
*NL*
slowly
,
and
the
words
seemed
wrung
out
of
him
almost
against
his
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense

talk

said
Lord
Henry

smiling

and
taking
Hallward

by

he
almost
led
him
into

CHAPTER
2
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
entered
they
saw
Dorian
Gray
.
He
was
seated
at
the
piano
,
with
*NL*
his
back
to
them
,
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
volume
of
Schumann
's
*NL*
``
Forest
Scenes
.
''
``
You
must
lend
me
these
,
Basil
,
''
he
cried
.
``
I
want
*NL*
to
learn
them
.
They
are
perfectly
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
entirely
depends
on
how
you
sit
to-day
,
Dorian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
tired
of
sitting
,
and
I
do
n't
want
a
life-sized
portrait
of
*NL*
myself
,
''
answered
the
lad
,
swinging
round
on
the
music-stool
in
a
*NL*
wilful
,
petulant
manner
.
When
he
caught
sight
of
Lord
Henry
,
a
faint
*NL*
blush
coloured
his
cheeks
for
a
moment
,
and
he
started
up
.
``
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon
,
Basil
,
but
I
did
n't
know
you
had
any
one
with
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Lord
Henry
Wotton
,
Dorian
,
an
old
Oxford
friend
of
mine
.
I
*NL*
have
just
been
telling
him
what
a
capital
sitter
you
were
,
and
now
you
*NL*
have
spoiled
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
spoiled
my
pleasure
in
meeting
you
,
Mr.
Gray
,
''
said
Lord
*NL*
Henry
,
stepping
forward
and
extending
his
hand
.
``
My
aunt
has
often
*NL*
spoken
to
me
about
you
.
You
are
one
of
her
favourites
,
and
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid
,
one
of
her
victims
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
Lady
Agatha
's
black
books
at
present
,
''
answered
Dorian
with
a
*NL*
funny
look
of
penitence
.
``
I
promised
to
go
to
a
club
in
Whitechapel
*NL*
with
her
last
Tuesday
,
and
I
really
forgot
all
about
it
.
We
were
to
*NL*
have
played
a
duet
together
--
three
duets
,
I
believe
.
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
she
will
say
to
me
.
I
am
far
too
frightened
to
call
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
make
your
peace
with
my
aunt

She
is
quite
devoted
to
you
.
*NL*
And
I
do
n't
think
it
really
matters
about
your
not
being
there
.
The
*NL*
audience
probably
thought
it
was
a
duet
.
When
Aunt
Agatha
sits
down
to
*NL*
the
piano
,
she
makes
quite
enough
noise
for
two
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
horrid
to
her
,
and
not
very
nice
to
me
,
''
answered
Dorian
,
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
looked
at
him
.
Yes
,
he
was
certainly
wonderfully
handsome
,
*NL*
with
his
finely
curved
scarlet
lips
,
his
frank
blue
eyes
,
his
crisp
*NL*
gold
hair
.
There
was
something
in
his
face
that
made
one
trust
him
at
*NL*
once
.
All
the
candour
of
youth
was
there
,
as
well
as
all
youth
's
*NL*
passionate
purity
.
One
felt
that
he
had
kept
himself
unspotted
from
*NL*
the
world
.
No
wonder
Basil
Hallward
worshipped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
charming
to
go
in
for
philanthropy
,
Mr.
Gray
--
far
too
*NL*
charming
.
''
And
Lord
Henry
flung
himself
down
on
the
divan
and
opened
*NL*
his
cigarette-case
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
had
been
busy
mixing
his
colours
and
getting
his
brushes
*NL*
ready
.
He
was
looking
worried
,
and
when
he
heard
Lord
Henry
's
last
*NL*
remark
,
he
glanced
at
him
,
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
*NL*
``
Harry
,
I
want
to
finish
this
picture
to-day
.
Would
you
think
it
*NL*
awfully
rude
of
me
if
I
asked
you
to
go
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
smiled
and
looked
at
Dorian
Gray
.
``

moods

I
ca
n't
bear
him

sulks

Besides

I
want
you

tell

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

It
is
so
tedious
a

subject
that
one
would
have
to
talk
seriously
about
it
.
But
I
*NL*
certainly
shall
not
run
away
,
now
that
you
have
asked
me
to
stop

You
*NL*
do
n't
really
mind
,
Basil

do
you

You
have
often
told
me

you
*NL*
liked
your
sitters

have
some
one
to
chat
to

*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
bit
his
lip
.
``
If
Dorian
wishes
it
,
of
course
you
must
stay

*NL*
Dorian
's
whims
are
laws
to
everybody

except
himself

*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
took
up
his
hat
and
gloves
.
``
You
are
very
pressing
,
Basil
,
*NL*
but
I
am
afraid
I
must
go

I
have
promised
to
meet
a
man
at
the
*NL*
Orleans
.
Good-bye
,
Mr.
Gray
.
Come
and
see
me
some
afternoon
in
Curzon
*NL*
Street
.
I
am
nearly
always
at
home
at
five
o'clock
.
Write
to
me
when
*NL*
you
are
coming

I
should
be
sorry

cried
Dorian
Gray
,
``

Lord
Henry
Wotton
goes

I
shall
go

*NL*
too

You
never
open
your
lips
while
you
are
painting
,
and
it
is
*NL*
horribly
dull
standing
on
a
platform
and
trying
to
look
pleasant

Ask
*NL*
him

stay

I
insist

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay

Hallward

*NL*
gazing
intently
at
his

``
It
is
quite
true
,
I
never

am
working

it
must
be
dreadfully
tedious

I
beg
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
about
my
man
at
the
Orleans
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
laughed
.
``
I
do
n't
think
there
will
be
any
difficulty
about
*NL*
that

Sit
down
again
,
Harry

And
now
,
Dorian
,
get
up
on
the
platform
,
*NL*
and
do
n't
move
about
too
much
,
or
pay
any
attention
to
what
Lord
Henry
*NL*
says
.
He
has
a
very
bad
influence
over
all
his
friends
,
with
the
*NL*
single
exception
of
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
stepped
up
on
the
dais
with
the
air
of
a
young
Greek
*NL*
martyr
,
and
made
a
little
_
moue
_
of
discontent
to
Lord
Henry
,
to
whom
he
*NL*
had
rather
taken
a
fancy
.
He
was
so
unlike
Basil
.
They
made
a
*NL*
delightful
contrast
.
And
he
had
such
a
beautiful
voice
.
After
a
few
*NL*
moments
he
said
to
him
,
``
Have
you
really
a
very
bad
influence
,
Lord
*NL*
Henry
?
As
bad
as
Basil
says
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
good
influence
,
Mr.
Gray
.
All
influence
*NL*
is
immoral
--
immoral
from
the
scientific
point
of
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
to
influence
a
person
is
to
give
him
one
's
own
soul
.
He
does
*NL*
not
think
his
natural
thoughts
,
or
burn
with
his
natural
passions
.
His
*NL*
virtues
are
not
real
to
him
.
His
sins
,
if
there
are
such
things
as
*NL*
sins
,
are
borrowed
.
He
becomes
an
echo
of
some
one
else
's
music
,
an
*NL*
actor
of
a
part
that
has
not
been
written
for
him
.
The
aim
of
life
is
*NL*
self-development
.
To
realize
one
's
nature
perfectly
--
that
is
what
each
*NL*
of
us
is
here
for
.
People
are
afraid
of
themselves
,
nowadays
.
They
*NL*
have
forgotten
the
highest
of
all
duties
,
the
duty
that
one
owes
to
*NL*
one
's
self
.
Of
course
,
they
are
charitable
.
They
feed
the
hungry
and
*NL*
clothe
the
beggar
.
But
their
own
souls
starve
,
and
are
naked
.
Courage
*NL*
has
gone
out
of
our
race
.
Perhaps
we
never
really
had
it
.
The
terror
*NL*
of
society
,
which
is
the
basis
of
morals
,
the
terror
of
God
,
which
is
*NL*
the
secret
of
religion
--
these
are
the
two
things
that
govern
us
.
And
*NL*
yet
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
turn
your
head
a
little
more
to
the
right
,
Dorian
,
like
a
good
*NL*
boy
,
''
said
the
painter
,
deep
in
his
work
and
conscious
only
that
a
look
*NL*
had
come
into
the
lad
's
face
that
he
had
never
seen
there
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
continued
Lord
Henry
,
in
his
low
,
musical
voice
,
and
with
*NL*
that
graceful
wave
of
the
hand
that
was
always
so
characteristic
of
*NL*
him
,
and
that
he
had
even
in
his
Eton
days
,
``
I
believe
that
if
one
man
*NL*
were
to
live
out
his
life
fully
and
completely
,
were
to
give
form
to
*NL*
every
feeling
,
expression
to
every
thought
,
reality
to
every
dream
--
I
*NL*
believe
that
the
world
would
gain
such
a
fresh
impulse
of
joy
that
we
*NL*
would
forget
all
the
maladies
of
mediaevalism
,
and
return
to
the
*NL*
Hellenic
ideal
--
to
something
finer
,
richer
than
the
Hellenic
ideal
,
it
*NL*
may
be
.
But
the
bravest
man
amongst
us
is
afraid
of
himself
.
The
*NL*
mutilation
of
the
savage
has
its
tragic
survival
in
the
self-denial
*NL*
that
mars
our
lives
.
We
are
punished
for
our
refusals
.
Every
impulse
*NL*
that
we
strive
to
strangle
broods
in
the
mind
and
poisons
us
.
The
body
*NL*
sins
once
,
and
has
done
with
its
sin
,
for
action
is
a
mode
of
*NL*
purification
.
Nothing
remains
then
but
the
recollection
of
a
pleasure
,
*NL*
or
the
luxury
of
a
regret
.
The
only
way
to
get
rid
of
a
temptation
is
*NL*
to
yield
to
it
.
Resist
it
,
and
your
soul
grows
sick
with
longing
for
*NL*
the
things
it
has
forbidden
to
itself
,
with
desire
for
what
its
*NL*
monstrous
laws
have
made
monstrous
and
unlawful
.
It
has
been
said
that
*NL*
the
great
events
of
the
world
take
place
in
the
brain
.
It
is
in
the
*NL*
brain
,
and
the
brain
only
,
that
the
great
sins
of
the
world
take
place
*NL*
also
.
You
,
Mr.
Gray
,
you
yourself
,
with
your
rose-red
youth
and
your
*NL*
rose-white
boyhood
,
you
have
had
passions
that
have
made
you
afraid
,
*NL*
thoughts
that
have
filled
you
with
terror
,
day-dreams
and
sleeping
*NL*
dreams
whose
mere
memory
might
stain
your
cheek
with
shame
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
faltered
Dorian
Gray
,
``
stop
!
you
bewilder
me
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
say
.
There
is
some
answer
to
you
,
but
I
can
not
find
it
.
Do
n't
*NL*
speak

Let
me
think

Or
,
rather
,
let
me
try
not
to
think

''
*NL*
*NL*
For
nearly
ten
minutes
he
stood
there
,
motionless
,
with
parted
lips
and
*NL*
eyes
strangely
bright
.
He
was
dimly
conscious
that
entirely
fresh
*NL*
influences
were
at
work
within
him
.
Yet
they
seemed
to
him
to
have
*NL*
come
really
from
himself
.
The
few
words
that
Basil
's
friend
had
said
*NL*
to
him
--
words
spoken
by
chance
,
no
doubt
,
and
with
wilful
paradox
in
*NL*
them
--
had
touched
some
secret
chord
that
had
never
been
touched
before
,
*NL*
but
that
he
felt
was
now
vibrating
and
throbbing
to
curious
pulses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Music
had
stirred
him
like
that
.
Music
had
troubled
him
many
times
.
*NL*
But
music
was
not
articulate
.
It
was
not
a
new
world
,
but
rather
*NL*
another
chaos
,
that
it
created
in
us
.
Words
!
Mere
words
!
How
*NL*
terrible
they
were
!
How
clear
,
and
vivid
,
and
cruel
!
One
could
not
*NL*
escape
from
them
.
And
yet
what
a
subtle
magic
there
was
in
them
!
They
*NL*
seemed
to
be
able
to
give
a
plastic
form
to
formless
things
,
and
to
*NL*
have
a
music
of
their
own
as
sweet
as
that
of
viol
or
of
lute
.
Mere
*NL*
words
!
Was
there
anything
so
real
as
words
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
;
there
had
been
things
in
his
boyhood
that
he
had
not
understood
.
*NL*
He
understood
them
now
.
Life
suddenly
became
fiery-coloured
to
him
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
walking
in
fire
.
Why
had
he
not
*NL*
known
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
his
subtle
smile
,
Lord
Henry
watched
him
.
He
knew
the
precise
*NL*
psychological
moment
when
to
say
nothing
.
He
felt
intensely
*NL*
interested
.
He
was
amazed
at
the
sudden
impression
that
his
words
had
*NL*
produced
,
and
,
remembering
a
book
that
he
had
read
when
he
was
sixteen
,
*NL*
a
book
which
had
revealed
to
him
much
that
he
had
not
known
before
,
he
*NL*
wondered
whether
Dorian
Gray
was
passing
through
a
similar
experience
.
*NL*
He
had
merely
shot
an
arrow
into
the
air
.
Had
it
hit
the
mark
?
How
*NL*
fascinating
the
lad
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
painted
away
with
that
marvellous
bold
touch
of
his
,
that
had
*NL*
the
true
refinement
and
perfect
delicacy
that
in
art
,
at
any
rate
comes
*NL*
only
from
strength
.
He
was
unconscious
of
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Basil
,
I
am
tired
of
standing
,
''
cried
Dorian
Gray
suddenly
.
``
I
must
*NL*
go
out
and
sit
in
the
garden
.
The
air
is
stifling
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
I
am
so
sorry

When
I
am
painting

I
ca
n't
think
of

anything
else

But
you
never
sat
better
.
You
were
perfectly
still
.
*NL*
And
I
have
caught
the
effect
I
wanted
--
the
half-parted
lips
and
the
*NL*
bright
look
in
the
eyes

I
do
n't
know
what
Harry
has
been
saying
to
*NL*
you

but
he
has
certainly
made
you
have
the
most
wonderful
expression

*NL*
I
suppose
he
has
been
paying
you
compliments
.
You
must
n't
believe
a
*NL*
word
that
he
says

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
certainly
not
been
paying
me
compliments

Perhaps
that
is
the
*NL*
reason

anything
he
has
told
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know

believe
it
all

said
Lord
Henry
,
looking
at
him
with
his
*NL*
dreamy
languorous
eyes
.
``
I
will
go
out
to
the
garden
with
you

It
is
*NL*
horribly
hot
in
the
studio

Basil

let
us
have
something
iced
to
*NL*
drink
,
something
with
strawberries
in
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
Harry
.
Just
touch
the
bell
,
and
when
Parker
comes
I
will
*NL*
tell
him
what
you
want
.
I
have
got
to
work
up
this
background
,
so
I
*NL*
will
join
you
later
on
.
Do
n't
keep
Dorian
too
long
.
I
have
never
been
*NL*
in
better
form
for
painting
than
I
am
to-day

This
is
going
to
be
my
*NL*
masterpiece

It
is
my
masterpiece
as
it
stands

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
went
out
to
the
garden
and
found
Dorian
Gray
burying
his
*NL*
face
in
the
great
cool
lilac-blossoms
,
feverishly
drinking
in
their
*NL*
perfume
as
if
it
had
been
wine
.
He
came
close
to
him
and
put
his
hand
*NL*
upon
his
shoulder
.
``
You
are
quite
right
to
do
that
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
can
cure
the
soul
but
the
senses
,
just
as
nothing
can
cure
the
*NL*
senses
but
the
soul

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
started
and
drew
back
.
He
was
bareheaded
,
and
the
leaves
had
*NL*
tossed
his
rebellious
curls
and
tangled
all
their
gilded
threads
.
*NL*
There
was
a
look
of
fear
in
his
eyes
,
such
as
people
have
when
they
are
*NL*
suddenly
awakened
.
His
finely
chiselled
nostrils
quivered
,
and
some
*NL*
hidden
nerve
shook
the
scarlet
of
his
lips
and
left
them
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
continued
Lord
Henry
,
``
that
is
one
of
the
great
secrets
of
*NL*
life

to
cure
the
soul

and
the
senses
by

of
the
soul

You
are
a
wonderful
creation

You
know
more
than
you
*NL*
think
you
know
,
just
as
you
know
less
than
you
want
to
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
frowned
and
turned
his
head
away
.
He
could
not
help
liking
*NL*
the
tall
,
graceful
young
man
who
was
standing
by
him
.
His
romantic
,
*NL*
olive-coloured
face
and
worn
expression
interested
him
.
There
was
*NL*
something
in
his
low
languid
voice
that
was
absolutely
fascinating
.
*NL*
His
cool
,
white
,
flowerlike
hands
,
even
,
had
a
curious
charm
.
They
*NL*
moved
,
as
he
spoke
,
like
music
,
and
seemed
to
have
a
language
of
their
*NL*
own
.
But
he
felt
afraid
of
him
,
and
ashamed
of
being
afraid
.
Why
had
*NL*
it
been
left
for
a
stranger
to
reveal
him
to
himself
?
He
had
known
*NL*
Basil
Hallward
for
months
,
but
the
friendship
between
them
had
never
*NL*
altered
him
.
Suddenly
there
had
come
some
one
across
his
life
who
*NL*
seemed
to
have
disclosed
to
him
life
's
mystery
.
And
,
yet
,
what
was
*NL*
there
to
be
afraid
of
?
He
was
not
a
schoolboy
or
a
girl
.
It
was
*NL*
absurd
to
be
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
and
sit
in
the
shade
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
.
``
Parker

brought
*NL*
out
the
drinks

and
if
you
stay
any
longer
in
this
glare
,
you

be
*NL*
quite
spoiled
,
and
Basil
will
never
paint
you
again

You
really
must
*NL*
not

become
sunburnt

What

it
matter
?
''
cried
Dorian
Gray
,
laughing
,
as
he
sat
down
on
*NL*
the
seat
at
the
end
of
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
should
matter
everything
to
you
,
Mr.
Gray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
have
the
most
marvellous
youth
,
and
youth
is
the
one
thing
*NL*
worth
having
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
feel
that
,
Lord
Henry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
do
n't
feel
it
now
.
Some
day
,
when
you
are
old
and
wrinkled
*NL*
and
ugly
,
when
thought
has
seared
your
forehead
with
its
lines
,
and
*NL*
passion
branded
your
lips
with
its
hideous
fires
,
you
will
feel
it
,
you
*NL*
will
feel
it
terribly
.
Now
,
wherever
you
go
,
you
charm
the
world
.
*NL*
Will
it
always
be
so
?
...
You
have
a
wonderfully
beautiful
face
,
Mr.
*NL*
Gray
.
Do
n't
frown
.
You
have
.
And
beauty
is
a
form
of
genius
--
is
*NL*
higher
,
indeed
,
than
genius
,
as
it
needs
no
explanation
.
It
is
of
the
*NL*
great
facts
of
the
world
,
like
sunlight
,
or
spring-time
,
or
the
*NL*
reflection
in
dark
waters
of
that
silver
shell
we
call
the
moon
.
It
*NL*
can
not
be
questioned
.
It
has
its
divine
right
of
sovereignty
.
It
*NL*
makes
princes
of
those
who
have
it
.
You
smile
?
Ah
!
when
you
have
lost
*NL*
it
you
wo
n't
smile
...
People
say
sometimes
that
beauty
is
only
*NL*
superficial
.
That
may
be
so
,
but
at
least
it
is
not
so
superficial
as
*NL*
thought
is
.
To
me
,
beauty
is
the
wonder
of
wonders
.
It
is
only
*NL*
shallow
people
who
do
not
judge
by
appearances
.
The
true
mystery
of
*NL*
the
world
is
the
visible
,
not
the
invisible
...
Yes
,
Mr.
Gray
,
the
*NL*
gods
have
been
good
to
you
.
But
what
the
gods
give
they
quickly
take
*NL*
away
.
You
have
only
a
few
years
in
which
to
live
really
,
perfectly
,
*NL*
and
fully
.
When
your
youth
goes
,
your
beauty
will
go
with
it
,
and
then
*NL*
you
will
suddenly
discover
that
there
are
no
triumphs
left
for
you
,
or
*NL*
have
to
content
yourself
with
those
mean
triumphs
that
the
memory
of
*NL*
your
past
will
make
more
bitter
than
defeats
.
Every
month
as
it
wanes
*NL*
brings
you
nearer
to
something
dreadful
.
Time
is
jealous
of
you
,
and
*NL*
wars
against
your
lilies
and
your
roses
.
You
will
become
sallow
,
and
*NL*
hollow-cheeked
,
and
dull-eyed
.
You
will
suffer
horribly
...
Ah
!
*NL*
realize
your
youth
while
you
have
it
.
Do
n't
squander
the
gold
of
your
*NL*
days
,
listening
to
the
tedious
,
trying
to
improve
the
hopeless
failure
,
*NL*
or
giving
away
your
life
to
the
ignorant
,
the
common
,
and
the
vulgar
.
*NL*
These
are
the
sickly
aims
,
the
false
ideals
,
of
our
age
.
Live
!
Live
*NL*
the
wonderful
life
that
is
in
you
!
Let
nothing
be
lost
upon
you
.
Be
*NL*
always
searching
for
new
sensations
.
Be
afraid
of
nothing
...
A
new
*NL*
Hedonism
--
that
is
what
our
century
wants
.
You
might
be
its
visible
*NL*
symbol
.
With
your
personality
there
is
nothing
you
could
not
do
.
The
*NL*
world
belongs
to
you
for
a
season
...
The
moment
I
met
you
I
saw
that
*NL*
you
were
quite
unconscious
of
what
you
really
are
,
of
what
you
really
*NL*
might
be
.
There
was
so
much
in
you
that
charmed
me
that
I
felt
I
must
*NL*
tell
you
something
about
yourself
.
I
thought
how
tragic
it
would
be
if
*NL*
you
were
wasted
.
For
there
is
such
a
little
time
that
your
youth
will
*NL*
last
--
such
a
little
time
.
The
common
hill-flowers
wither
,
but
they
*NL*
blossom
again
.
The
laburnum
will
be
as
yellow
next
June
as
it
is
now
.
*NL*
In
a
month
there
will
be
purple
stars
on
the
clematis
,
and
year
after
*NL*
year
the
green
night
of
its
leaves
will
hold
its
purple
stars
.
But
we
*NL*
never
get
back
our
youth
.
The
pulse
of
joy
that
beats
in
us
at
twenty
*NL*
becomes
sluggish
.
Our
limbs
fail
,
our
senses
rot
.
We
degenerate
into
*NL*
hideous
puppets
,
haunted
by
the
memory
of
the
passions
of
which
we
were
*NL*
too
much
afraid
,
and
the
exquisite
temptations
that
we
had
not
the
*NL*
courage
to
yield
to
.
Youth
!
Youth
!
There
is
absolutely
nothing
in
*NL*
the
world
but
youth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
listened
,
open-eyed
and
wondering
.
The
spray
of
lilac
fell
*NL*
from
his
hand
upon
the
gravel
.
A
furry
bee
came
and
buzzed
round
it
*NL*
for
a
moment
.
Then
it
began
to
scramble
all
over
the
oval
stellated
*NL*
globe
of
the
tiny
blossoms
.
He
watched
it
with
that
strange
interest
*NL*
in
trivial
things
that
we
try
to
develop
when
things
of
high
import
*NL*
make
us
afraid
,
or
when
we
are
stirred
by
some
new
emotion
for
which
we
*NL*
can
not
find
expression
,
or
when
some
thought
that
terrifies
us
lays
*NL*
sudden
siege
to
the
brain
and
calls
on
us
to
yield
.
After
a
time
the
*NL*
bee
flew
away
.
He
saw
it
creeping
into
the
stained
trumpet
of
a
Tyrian
*NL*
convolvulus
.
The
flower
seemed
to
quiver
,
and
then
swayed
gently
to
*NL*
and
fro
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
painter
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
studio
and
made
*NL*
staccato
signs
for
them
to
come
in
.
They
turned
to
each
other
and
*NL*
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
waiting
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Do
come
in
.
The
light
is
quite
perfect
,
*NL*
and
you
can
bring
your
drinks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rose
up
and
sauntered
down
the
walk
together
.
Two
green-and-white
*NL*
butterflies
fluttered
past
them
,
and
in
the
pear-tree
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
the
garden
a
thrush
began
to
sing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
glad
you
have
met
me
,
Mr.
Gray
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
looking
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
glad
now
.
I
wonder
shall
I
always
be
glad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
!
That
is
a
dreadful
word
.
It
makes
me
shudder
when
I
hear
it
.
*NL*
Women
are
so
fond
of
using
it
.
They
spoil
every
romance
by
trying
to
*NL*
make
it
last
for
ever
.
It
is
a
meaningless
word
,
too
.
The
only
*NL*
difference
between
a
caprice
and
a
lifelong
passion
is
that
the
caprice
*NL*
lasts
a
little
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
entered
the
studio
,
Dorian
Gray
put
his
hand
upon
Lord
Henry
's
*NL*
arm
.
``
In
that
case
,
let
our
friendship
be
a
caprice
,
''
he
murmured
,
*NL*
flushing
at
his
own
boldness
,
then
stepped
up
on
the
platform
and
*NL*
resumed
his
pose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
flung
himself
into
a
large
wicker
arm-chair
and
watched
him
.
*NL*
The
sweep
and
dash
of
the
brush
on
the
canvas
made
the
only
sound
that
*NL*
broke
the
stillness
,
except
when
,
now
and
then
,
Hallward
stepped
back
*NL*
to
look
at
his
work
from
a
distance
.
In
the
slanting
beams
that
*NL*
streamed
through
the
open
doorway
the
dust
danced
and
was
golden
.
The
*NL*
heavy
scent
of
the
roses
seemed
to
brood
over
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Hallward
stopped
painting
,
looked
for
*NL*
a
long
time
at
Dorian
Gray
,
and
then
for
a
long
time
at
the
picture
,
*NL*
biting
the
end
of
one
of
his
huge
brushes
and
frowning
.
``
It
is
quite
*NL*
finished
,
''
he
cried
at
last
,
and
stooping
down
he
wrote
his
name
in
*NL*
long
vermilion
letters
on
the
left-hand
corner
of
the
canvas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
came
over
and
examined
the
picture
.
It
was
certainly
a
*NL*
wonderful
work
of
art
,
and
a
wonderful
likeness
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
I
congratulate
you
most
warmly
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
is
the
*NL*
finest
portrait
of
modern
times
.
Mr.
Gray
,
come
over
and
look
at
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
started
,
as
if
awakened
from
some
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
finished
?
''
he
murmured
,
stepping
down
from
the
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
finished
,
''
said
the
painter
.
``
And
you
have
sat
splendidly
*NL*
to-day
.
I
am
awfully
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
entirely
due
to
me
,
''
broke
in
Lord
Henry
.
``
Is
n't
it
,
Mr.
*NL*
Gray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
made
no
answer
,
but
passed
listlessly
in
front
of
his
picture
*NL*
and
turned
towards
it
.
When
he
saw
it
he
drew
back
,
and
his
cheeks
*NL*
flushed
for
a
moment
with
pleasure
.
A
look
of
joy
came
into
his
eyes
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
recognized
himself
for
the
first
time
.
He
stood
there
*NL*
motionless
and
in
wonder
,
dimly
conscious
that
Hallward
was
speaking
to
*NL*
him
,
but
not
catching
the
meaning
of
his
words
.
The
sense
of
his
own
*NL*
beauty
came
on
him
like
a
revelation
.
He
had
never
felt
it
before
.
*NL*
Basil
Hallward
's
compliments
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
merely
the
*NL*
charming
exaggeration
of
friendship
.
He
had
listened
to
them
,
laughed
*NL*
at
them
,
forgotten
them
.
They
had
not
influenced
his
nature
.
Then
had
*NL*
come
Lord
Henry
Wotton
with
his
strange
panegyric
on
youth
,
his
*NL*
terrible
warning
of
its
brevity
.
That
had
stirred
him
at
the
time
,
and
*NL*
now
,
as
he
stood
gazing
at
the
shadow
of
his
own
loveliness
,
the
full
*NL*
reality
of
the
description
flashed
across
him
.
Yes
,
there
would
be
a
*NL*
day
when
his
face
would
be
wrinkled
and
wizen
,
his
eyes
dim
and
*NL*
colourless
,
the
grace
of
his
figure
broken
and
deformed
.
The
scarlet
*NL*
would
pass
away
from
his
lips
and
the
gold
steal
from
his
hair
.
The
*NL*
life
that
was
to
make
his
soul
would
mar
his
body
.
He
would
become
*NL*
dreadful
,
hideous
,
and
uncouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
thought
of
it
,
a
sharp
pang
of
pain
struck
through
him
like
a
*NL*
knife
and
made
each
delicate
fibre
of
his
nature
quiver
.
His
eyes
*NL*
deepened
into
amethyst
,
and
across
them
came
a
mist
of
tears
.
He
felt
*NL*
as
if
a
hand
of
ice
had
been
laid
upon
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
like
it
?
''
cried
Hallward
at
last
,
stung
a
little
by
the
*NL*
lad
's
silence
,
not
understanding
what
it
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
likes
it
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
.
``
Who
would
n't
like
it
?
It
*NL*
is
one
of
the
greatest
things
in
modern
art
.
I
will
give
you
anything
*NL*
you
like
to
ask
for
it
.
I
must
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
my
property
,
Harry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
property
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
's
,
of
course
,
''
answered
the
painter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
very
lucky
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
sad
it
is
!
''
murmured
Dorian
Gray
with
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
*NL*
his
own
portrait
.
``
How
sad
it
is
!
I
shall
grow
old
,
and
horrible
,
and
*NL*
dreadful
.
But
this
picture
will
remain
always
young
.
It
will
never
be
*NL*
older
than
this
particular
day
of
June
...
If
it
were
only
the
other
*NL*
way
!
If
it
were
I
who
was
to
be
always
young
,
and
the
picture
that
was
*NL*
to
grow
old
!
For
that
--
for
that
--
I
would
give
everything
!
Yes
,
there
*NL*
is
nothing
in
the
whole
world
I
would
not
give
!
I
would
give
my
soul
*NL*
for
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
hardly
care
for
such
an
arrangement
,
Basil
,
''
cried
Lord
*NL*
Henry
,
laughing
.
``
It
would
be
rather
hard
lines
on
your
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
object
very
strongly
,
Harry
,
''
said
Hallward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
turned
and
looked
at
him
.
``
I
believe
you
would
,
Basil
.
*NL*
You
like
your
art
better
than
your
friends
.
I
am
no
more
to
you
than
a
*NL*
green
bronze
figure
.
Hardly
as
much
,
I
dare
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
stared
in
amazement
.
It
was
so
unlike
Dorian
to
speak
like
*NL*
that
.
What
had
happened
?
He
seemed
quite
angry
.
His
face
was
flushed
*NL*
and
his
cheeks
burning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
continued
,
``
I
am
less
to
you
than
your
ivory
Hermes
or
your
*NL*
silver
Faun
.
You
will
like
them
always
.
How
long
will
you
like
me
?
*NL*
Till
I
have
my
first
wrinkle
,
I
suppose
.
I
know
,
now
,
that
when
one
*NL*
loses
one
's
good
looks
,
whatever
they
may
be
,
one
loses
everything
.
*NL*
Your
picture
has
taught
me
that
.
Lord
Henry
Wotton
is
perfectly
right
.
*NL*
Youth
is
the
only
thing
worth
having
.
When
I
find
that
I
am
growing
*NL*
old
,
I
shall
kill
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
turned
pale
and
caught
his
hand
.
``
Dorian
!
Dorian
!
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
``
do
n't
talk
like
that
.
I
have
never
had
such
a
friend
as
you
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
never
have
such
another
.
You
are
not
jealous
of
material
things
,
*NL*
are
you
?
--
you
who
are
finer
than
any
of
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
jealous
of
everything
whose
beauty
does
not
die
.
I
am
jealous
of
*NL*
the
portrait
you
have
painted
of
me
.
Why
should
it
keep
what
I
must
*NL*
lose
?
Every
moment
that
passes
takes
something
from
me
and
gives
*NL*
something
to
it
.
Oh
,
if
it
were
only
the
other
way
!
If
the
picture
*NL*
could
change
,
and
I
could
be
always
what
I
am
now
!
Why
did
you
paint
*NL*
it
?
It
will
mock
me
some
day
--
mock
me
horribly
!
''
The
hot
tears
welled
*NL*
into
his
eyes
;
he
tore
his
hand
away
and
,
flinging
himself
on
the
*NL*
divan
,
he
buried
his
face
in
the
cushions
,
as
though
he
was
praying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
your
doing
,
Harry
,
''
said
the
painter
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
It
is
the
real
Dorian
Gray
--
that
*NL*
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
not

what
have
I
to
do
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
gone
away
when
I
asked
you
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
stayed
when
you
asked
me
,
''
was
Lord
Henry
's
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harry
,
I
ca
n't
quarrel
with
my
two
best
friends
at
once
,
but
between
*NL*
you
both
you
have
made
me
hate
the
finest
piece
of
work
I
have
ever
*NL*
done
,
and
I
will
destroy
it
.
What
is
it
but
canvas
and
colour
?
I
will
*NL*
not
let
it
come
across
our
three
lives
and
mar
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
lifted
his
golden
head
from
the
pillow
,
and
with
pallid
*NL*
face
and
tear-stained
eyes
,
looked
at
him
as
he
walked
over
to
the
deal
*NL*
painting-table
that
was
set
beneath
the
high
curtained
window
.
What
*NL*
was
he
doing
there
?
His
fingers
were
straying
about
among
the
litter
*NL*
of
tin
tubes
and
dry
brushes
,
seeking
for
something
.
Yes
,
it
was
for
*NL*
the
long
palette-knife
,
with
its
thin
blade
of
lithe
steel
.
He
had
*NL*
found
it
at
last
.
He
was
going
to
rip
up
the
canvas
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
stifled
sob
the
lad
leaped
from
the
couch
,
and
,
rushing
over
to
*NL*
Hallward
,
tore
the
knife
out
of
his
hand
,
and
flung
it
to
the
end
of
*NL*
the
studio
.
``
Do
n't
,
Basil
,
do
n't
!
''
he
cried
.
``
It
would
be
murder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
appreciate
my
work
at
last
,
Dorian
,
''
said
the
painter
*NL*
coldly
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
.
``
I
never
thought
you
*NL*
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Appreciate
it
?
I
am
in
love
with
it
,
Basil
.
It
is
part
of
myself
.
I
*NL*
feel
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
soon
as
you
are
dry
,
you
shall
be
varnished
,
and
framed
,
and
*NL*
sent
home
.
Then
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
yourself
.
''
And
he
walked
*NL*
across
the
room
and
rang
the
bell
for
tea
.
``
You
will
have
tea
,
of
*NL*
course
,
Dorian
?
And
so
will
you
,
Harry
?
Or
do
you
object
to
such
*NL*
simple
pleasures

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
adore
simple
pleasures
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
.
``
They
are
the
last
refuge
*NL*
of
the
complex

But
I
do
n't
like
scenes
,
except
on

stage
.
What
*NL*
absurd
fellows
you
are
,
both
of
you
!
I
wonder
who
it
was
defined
man
*NL*
as
a
rational
animal

It
was
the
most
premature
definition
ever
given
.
*NL*
Man
is
many

he
is
not
rational

I
am
glad
he
is
not

all

though
I
wish
you
chaps
would
not
squabble
over
the
picture

You
*NL*
had
much
better
let
me
have
it

Basil

This
silly
boy
does
n't
really
*NL*
want
it

I
really
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

let
any
one
have
it

me

I
shall
never
forgive
you

cried
Dorian
Gray
;
``
and
I
do
n't
allow
people
to
call
me
a
silly
boy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
picture
is
yours

I
gave
it
to
you
before

*NL*
existed

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
you
have
been
a

silly

Mr.

object
to
being
reminded
that
you
are
extremely
young

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
objected
very
strongly
this
morning

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

morning
!
You

*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
the
butler
entered
with
a
laden
*NL*
tea-tray
and
set
it
down
upon
a
small
Japanese
table
.
There
was
a
*NL*
rattle
of
cups
and
saucers
and
the
hissing
of
a
fluted
Georgian
urn
.
*NL*
Two
globe-shaped
china
dishes
were
brought
in
by
a
page
.
Dorian
Gray
*NL*
went
over
and
poured
out
the
tea
.
The
two
men
sauntered
languidly
to
*NL*
the
table
and
examined
what
was
under
the
covers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
to
the
theatre
to-night
,
''
said
Lord
Henry

``
There
is
sure
*NL*
to
be
something
on

somewhere

I
have
promised
to
dine
at
White

but
*NL*
it
is
only
with
an
old
friend
,
so
I
can
send
him
a
wire
to
say
that
I
*NL*
am
ill
,
or
that
I
am
prevented
from
coming
in
consequence
of
a
*NL*
subsequent
engagement
.
I
think
that
would
be
a
rather
nice
excuse

it

would
have
all
the
surprise
of
candour

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
such
a
bore
putting
on

dress-clothes

Hallward

*NL*
``
And

when

on

Yes

answered
Lord

dreamily
,
``
the
costume

detestable

left
in
modern

*NL*
``
You

Before

*NL*
The
painter
bit
his
lip
and
walked
over
,
cup
in
hand
,
to
the
picture
.
*NL*
``
I
shall
stay
with
the
real
Dorian

he
said
,
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

cried
the
original
of
the
portrait

strolling
*NL*
across
to
him
.
``
Am

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

At

Hallward

``
That

What

exclaimed
Lord

``
Why

in

purely

nothing

Young

want
to
be
faithful

are
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

laughed

his

The

hesitated

looked
over
at

was
watching

from
the
tea-table
with
an
amused
smile

answered

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

Hallward

he
went
over

laid
down

on

the
tray

As
the
door
closed
behind
them

the

flung

down

CHAPTER
3
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
twelve
next
day
Lord
Henry
Wotton
strolled
from
Curzon
*NL*
Street
over
to
the
Albany
to
call
on
his
uncle
,
Lord
Fermor
,
a
genial
*NL*
if
somewhat
rough-mannered
old
bachelor
,
whom
the
outside
world
called
*NL*
selfish
because
it
derived
no
particular
benefit
from
him
,
but
who
was
*NL*
considered
generous
by
Society
as
he
fed
the
people
who
amused
him
.
*NL*
His
father
had
been
our
ambassador
at
Madrid
when
Isabella
was
young
*NL*
and
Prim
unthought
of
,
but
had
retired
from
the
diplomatic
service
in
a
*NL*
capricious
moment
of
annoyance
on
not
being
offered
the
Embassy
at
*NL*
Paris
,
a
post
to
which
he
considered
that
he
was
fully
entitled
by
*NL*
reason
of
his
birth
,
his
indolence
,
the
good
English
of
his
dispatches
,
*NL*
and
his
inordinate
passion
for
pleasure
.
The
son
,
who
had
been
his
*NL*
father
's
secretary
,
had
resigned
along
with
his
chief
,
somewhat
*NL*
foolishly
as
was
thought
at
the
time
,
and
on
succeeding
some
months
*NL*
later
to
the
title
,
had
set
himself
to
the
serious
study
of
the
great
*NL*
aristocratic
art
of
doing
absolutely
nothing
.
He
had
two
large
town
*NL*
houses
,
but
preferred
to
live
in
chambers
as
it
was
less
trouble
,
and
*NL*
took
most
of
his
meals
at
his
club
.
He
paid
some
attention
to
the
*NL*
management
of
his
collieries
in
the
Midland
counties
,
excusing
himself
*NL*
for
this
taint
of
industry
on
the
ground
that
the
one
advantage
of
*NL*
having
coal
was
that
it
enabled
a
gentleman
to
afford
the
decency
of
*NL*
burning
wood
on
his
own
hearth
.
In
politics
he
was
a
Tory
,
except
when
*NL*
the
Tories
were
in
office
,
during
which
period
he
roundly
abused
them
*NL*
for
being
a
pack
of
Radicals
.
He
was
a
hero
to
his
valet
,
who
bullied
*NL*
him
,
and
a
terror
to
most
of
his
relations
,
whom
he
bullied
in
turn
.
*NL*
Only
England
could
have
produced
him
,
and
he
always
said
that
the
*NL*
country
was
going
to
the
dogs
.
His
principles
were
out
of
date
,
but
*NL*
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
his
prejudices
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lord
Henry
entered
the
room
,
he
found
his
uncle
sitting
in
a
rough
*NL*
shooting-coat
,
smoking
a
cheroot
and
grumbling
over
_
The
Times
_
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
Harry
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
``
what
brings
you
out
so
early
?
I
*NL*
thought
you
dandies
never
got
up
till
two
,
and
were
not
visible
till
*NL*
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pure
family
affection
,
I
assure
you
,
Uncle
George
.
I
want
to
get
*NL*
something
out
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
Lord
Fermor
,
making
a
wry
face
.
``
Well
,
sit
*NL*
down
and
tell
me
all
about
it
.
Young
people
,
nowadays
,
imagine
that
*NL*
money
is
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
murmured
Lord
Henry
,
settling
his
button-hole
in
his
coat
;
``
and
*NL*
when
they
grow
older
they
know
it
.
But
I
do
n't
want
money
.
It
is
only
*NL*
people
who
pay
their
bills
who
want
that
,
Uncle
George
,
and
I
never
pay
*NL*
mine
.
Credit
is
the
capital
of
a
younger
son
,
and
one
lives
charmingly
*NL*
upon
it
.
Besides
,
I
always
deal
with
Dartmoor
's
tradesmen
,
and
*NL*
consequently
they
never
bother
me
.
What
I
want
is
information
:
not
*NL*
useful
information
,
of
course
;
useless
information
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
can
tell
you
anything
that
is
in
an
English
Blue
Book
,
Harry
,
*NL*
although
those
fellows
nowadays
write
a
lot
of
nonsense
.
When
I
was
in
*NL*
the
Diplomatic
,
things
were
much
better
.
But
I
hear
they
let
them
in
*NL*
now
by
examination
.
What
can
you
expect
?
Examinations
,
sir
,
are
pure
*NL*
humbug
from
beginning
to
end
.
If
a
man
is
a
gentleman
,
he
knows
quite
*NL*
enough
,
and
if
he
is
not
a
gentleman

languidly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Dorian
Gray
?
Who
is
he
?
''
asked
Lord
Fermor
,
knitting
his
bushy

white
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
have
come
to
learn
,
Uncle
George
.
Or
rather
,
I
know
*NL*
who
he
is
.
He
is
the
last
Lord
Kelso
's
grandson
.
His
mother
was
a
*NL*
Devereux
,
Lady
Margaret
Devereux
.
I
want
you
to
tell
me
about
his
*NL*
mother
.
What
was
she
like
?
Whom
did
she
marry
?
You
have
known
nearly
*NL*
everybody
in
your
time
,
so
you
might
have
known
her
.
I
am
very
much
*NL*
interested
in
Mr.
Gray
at
present
.
I
have
only
just
met
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kelso
's
grandson
!
''
echoed
the
old
gentleman
.
``
Kelso
's
grandson
!
...
*NL*
Of
course
...
I
knew
his
mother
intimately
.
I
believe
I
was
at
her
*NL*
christening
.
She
was
an
extraordinarily
beautiful
girl
,
Margaret
*NL*
Devereux
,
and
made
all
the
men
frantic
by
running
away
with
a
penniless
*NL*
young
fellow
--
a
mere
nobody
,
sir
,
a
subaltern
in
a
foot
regiment
,
or
*NL*
something
of
that
kind
.
Certainly
.
I
remember
the
whole
thing
as
if
*NL*
it
happened
yesterday
.
The
poor
chap
was
killed
in
a
duel
at
Spa
a
few
*NL*
months
after
the
marriage
.
There
was
an
ugly
story
about
it
.
They
*NL*
said
Kelso
got
some
rascally
adventurer
,
some
Belgian
brute
,
to
insult
*NL*
his
son-in-law
in
public
--
paid
him
,
sir
,
to
do
it
,
paid
him
--
and
that
*NL*
the
fellow
spitted
his
man
as
if
he
had
been
a
pigeon
.
The
thing
was
*NL*
hushed
up
,
but
,
egad
,
Kelso
ate
his
chop
alone
at
the
club
for
some
*NL*
time
afterwards
.
He
brought
his
daughter
back
with
him
,
I
was
told
,
*NL*
and
she
never
spoke
to
him
again
.
Oh
,
yes
;
it
was
a
bad
business
.
The
*NL*
girl
died
,
too
,
died
within
a
year
.
So
she
left
a
son
,
did
she
?
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
that
.
What
sort
of
boy
is
he
?
If
he
is
like
his
mother
,
he
*NL*
must
be
a
good-looking
chap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
good-looking
,
''
assented
Lord
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
he
will
fall
into
proper
hands
,
''
continued
the
old
man
.
``
He
*NL*
should
have
a
pot
of
money
waiting
for
him
if
Kelso
did
the
right
thing
*NL*
by
him
.
His
mother
had
money
,
too
.
All
the
Selby
property
came
to
*NL*
her
,
through
her
grandfather
.
Her
grandfather
hated
Kelso
,
thought
him
*NL*
a
mean
dog
.
He
was
,
too
.
Came
to
Madrid
once
when
I
was
there
.
Egad
,
*NL*
I
was
ashamed
of
him
.
The
Queen
used
to
ask
me
about
the
English
noble
*NL*
who
was
always
quarrelling
with
the
cabmen
about
their
fares
.
They
*NL*
made
quite
a
story
of
it
.
I
did
n't
dare
show
my
face
at
Court
for
a
*NL*
month
.
I
hope
he
treated
his
grandson
better
than
he
did
the
jarvies

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,

answered
Lord
Henry
.
``
I
fancy
that
the
boy
will
be
*NL*
well
off

He
is
not
of
age
yet
.
He
has
Selby

I
know

He
told
me
so

And

his

was
very
beautiful
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
Devereux
was
one
of
the
loveliest
creatures
I
ever
saw

Harry

What
on

induced
her
to
behave
as
she
did
,
I
never
could
*NL*
understand
.
She
could
have
married
anybody
she
chose
.
Carlington
was
*NL*
mad
after
her
.
She
was
romantic
,
though
.
All
the
women
of
that

The

a
poor

Carlington
went

there
was

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
growled
approvingly
and
rang
the
bell
for
his
*NL*
servant
.
Lord
Henry
passed
up
the
low
arcade
into
Burlington
Street
*NL*
and
turned
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
Berkeley
Square
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
was
the
story
of
Dorian
Gray
's
parentage
.
Crudely
as
it
had
*NL*
been
told
to
him
,
it
had
yet
stirred
him
by
its
suggestion
of
a
*NL*
strange
,
almost
modern
romance
.
A
beautiful
woman
risking
everything
*NL*
for
a
mad
passion
.
A
few
wild
weeks
of
happiness
cut
short
by
a
*NL*
hideous
,
treacherous
crime
.
Months
of
voiceless
agony
,
and
then
a
*NL*
child
born
in
pain
.
The
mother
snatched
away
by
death
,
the
boy
left
to
*NL*
solitude
and
the
tyranny
of
an
old
and
loveless
man
.
Yes
;
it
was
an
*NL*
interesting
background
.
It
posed
the
lad
,
made
him
more
perfect
,
as
it
*NL*
were
.
Behind
every
exquisite
thing
that
existed
,
there
was
something
*NL*
tragic
.
Worlds
had
to
be
in
travail
,
that
the
meanest
flower
might
*NL*
blow
...
And
how
charming
he
had
been
at
dinner
the
night
before
,
as
*NL*
with
startled
eyes
and
lips
parted
in
frightened
pleasure
he
had
sat
*NL*
opposite
to
him
at
the
club
,
the
red
candleshades
staining
to
a
richer
*NL*
rose
the
wakening
wonder
of
his
face
.
Talking
to
him
was
like
playing
*NL*
upon
an
exquisite
violin
.
He
answered
to
every
touch
and
thrill
of
the
*NL*
bow
...
There
was
something
terribly
enthralling
in
the
exercise
of
*NL*
influence
.
No
other
activity
was
like
it
.
To
project
one
's
soul
into
*NL*
some
gracious
form
,
and
let
it
tarry
there
for
a
moment
;
to
hear
one
's
*NL*
own
intellectual
views
echoed
back
to
one
with
all
the
added
music
of
*NL*
passion
and
youth
;
to
convey
one
's
temperament
into
another
as
though
*NL*
it
were
a
subtle
fluid
or
a
strange
perfume
:
there
was
a
real
joy
in
*NL*
that
--
perhaps
the
most
satisfying
joy
left
to
us
in
an
age
so
limited
*NL*
and
vulgar
as
our
own
,
an
age
grossly
carnal
in
its
pleasures
,
and
*NL*
grossly
common
in
its
aims
...
He
was
a
marvellous
type
,
too
,
this
lad
,
*NL*
whom
by
so
curious
a
chance
he
had
met
in
Basil
's
studio
,
or
could
be
*NL*
fashioned
into
a
marvellous
type
,
at
any
rate
.
Grace
was
his
,
and
the
*NL*
white
purity
of
boyhood
,
and
beauty
such
as
old
Greek
marbles
kept
for
*NL*
us
.
There
was
nothing
that
one
could
not
do
with
him
.
He
could
be
*NL*
made
a
Titan
or
a
toy
.
What
a
pity
it
was
that
such
beauty
was
*NL*
destined
to
fade
!
...
And
Basil
?
From
a
psychological
point
of
view
,
*NL*
how
interesting
he
was
!
The
new
manner
in
art
,
the
fresh
mode
of
*NL*
looking
at
life
,
suggested
so
strangely
by
the
merely
visible
presence
*NL*
of
one
who
was
unconscious
of
it
all
;
the
silent
spirit
that
dwelt
in
*NL*
dim
woodland
,
and
walked
unseen
in
open
field
,
suddenly
showing
*NL*
herself
,
Dryadlike
and
not
afraid
,
because
in
his
soul
who
sought
for
*NL*
her
there
had
been
wakened
that
wonderful
vision
to
which
alone
are
*NL*
wonderful
things
revealed
;
the
mere
shapes
and
patterns
of
things
*NL*
becoming
,
as
it
were
,
refined
,
and
gaining
a
kind
of
symbolical
value
,
*NL*
as
though
they
were
themselves
patterns
of
some
other
and
more
perfect
*NL*
form
whose
shadow
they
made
real
:
how
strange
it
all
was
!
He
*NL*
remembered
something
like
it
in
history
.
Was
it
not
Plato
,
that
artist
*NL*
in
thought
,
who
had
first
analyzed
it
?
Was
it
not
Buonarotti
who
had
*NL*
carved
it
in
the
coloured
marbles
of
a
sonnet-sequence
?
But
in
our
own
*NL*
century
it
was
strange
...
Yes
;
he
would
try
to
be
to
Dorian
Gray
*NL*
what
,
without
knowing
it
,
the
lad
was
to
the
painter
who
had
fashioned
*NL*
the
wonderful
portrait
.
He
would
seek
to
dominate
him
--
had
already
,
*NL*
indeed
,
half
done
so
.
He
would
make
that
wonderful
spirit
his
own
.
*NL*
There
was
something
fascinating
in
this
son
of
love
and
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
stopped
and
glanced
up
at
the
houses
.
He
found
that
he
had
*NL*
passed
his
aunt
's
some
distance
,
and
,
smiling
to
himself
,
turned
back
.
*NL*
When
he
entered
the
somewhat
sombre
hall
,
the
butler
told
him
that
they
*NL*
had
gone
in
to
lunch
.
He
gave
one
of
the
footmen
his
hat
and
stick
and
*NL*
passed
into
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Late
as
usual
,
Harry
,
''
cried
his
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
invented
a
facile
excuse
,
and
having
taken
the
vacant
seat
next
to
*NL*
her
,
looked
round
to
see
who
was
there
.
Dorian
bowed
to
him
shyly
from
*NL*
the
end
of
the
table
,
a
flush
of
pleasure
stealing
into
his
cheek
.
*NL*
Opposite
was
the
Duchess
of
Harley
,
a
lady
of
admirable
good-nature
and
*NL*
good
temper
,
much
liked
by
every
one
who
knew
her
,
and
of
those
ample
*NL*
architectural
proportions
that
in
women
who
are
not
duchesses
are
*NL*
described
by
contemporary
historians
as
stoutness
.
Next
to
her
sat
,
on
*NL*
her
right
,
Sir
Thomas
Burdon
,
a
Radical
member
of
Parliament
,
who
*NL*
followed
his
leader
in
public
life
and
in
private
life
followed
the
*NL*
best
cooks
,
dining
with
the
Tories
and
thinking
with
the
Liberals
,
in
*NL*
accordance
with
a
wise
and
well-known
rule
.
The
post
on
her
left
was
*NL*
occupied
by
Mr.
Erskine
of
Treadley
,
an
old
gentleman
of
considerable
*NL*
charm
and
culture
,
who
had
fallen
,
however
,
into
bad
habits
of
silence
,
*NL*
having
,
as
he
explained
once
to
Lady
Agatha
,
said
everything
that
he
*NL*
had
to
say
before
he
was
thirty
.
His
own
neighbour
was
Mrs.
Vandeleur
,
*NL*
one
of
his
aunt
's
oldest
friends
,
a
perfect
saint
amongst
women
,
but
so
*NL*
dreadfully
dowdy
that
she
reminded
one
of
a
badly
bound
hymn-book
.
*NL*
Fortunately
for
him
she
had
on
the
other
side
Lord
Faudel
,
a
most
*NL*
intelligent
middle-aged
mediocrity
,
as
bald
as
a
ministerial
statement
*NL*
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
with
whom
she
was
conversing
in
that
intensely
*NL*
earnest
manner
which
is
the
one
unpardonable
error
,
as
he
remarked
once
*NL*
himself
,
that
all
really
good
people
fall
into
,
and
from
which
none
of
*NL*
them
ever
quite
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
talking
about
poor
Dartmoor
,
Lord
Henry
,
''
cried
the
duchess
,
*NL*
nodding
pleasantly
to
him
across
the
table
.
``
Do
you
think
he
will
*NL*
really
marry
this
fascinating
young
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
she

*NL*
*NL*
``

exclaimed
Lady
Agatha
.
``
Really

some
one

interfere

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
told

authority

American

said
Sir
Thomas
Burdon
,
looking
supercilious

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

*NL*
*NL*
``

asked
the
duchess
,
raising
*NL*
her
large
hands
in
wonder
and
accentuating
the
verb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
American
novels

answered
Lord
Henry
,
helping
himself
to
some
quail
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
looked
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
him
,
my

whispered
Lady
Agatha
.
``
He
never
means
*NL*
anything
that
he
says

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
America
was
discovered
,
''
said
the
Radical
member
--
and
he
began
to
*NL*
give
some
wearisome
facts
.
Like
all
people
who
try
to
exhaust
a
*NL*
subject
,
he
exhausted
his
listeners
.
The
duchess
sighed
and
exercised
*NL*
her
privilege
of
interruption
.
``
I
wish
to
goodness
it
never
had
been
*NL*
discovered
at
all
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Really
,
our

have
no
chance

nowadays

It
is
most
unfair

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
after
all

America
never
has
been
discovered

''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Erskine
;
``
I
myself
would
say
that
it
had
merely
been
detected

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
but
I
have
seen
specimens
of
the
inhabitants

answered
the
*NL*
duchess
vaguely
.
``
I
must
confess
that
most
of
them
are
extremely
*NL*
pretty

And
they
dress
well

too

They
get
all
their
dresses
in
*NL*
Paris

I
wish
I
could
afford
to
do
the
same

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
that

go

Sir

Thomas
,

had
a
large
wardrobe

*NL*

Lord
Henry

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
frowned
.
``
I
am
afraid
that
your
nephew

prejudiced
*NL*
against
that
great
country

he
said
to
Lady
Agatha

I
have
travelled

all
over
it

extremely
civil

*NL*

But
must
we

Mr.

plaintively

I
do

up

*NL*
*NL*
Sir

waved
his
hand

``
Mr.

Treadley

the

on

his

Yes

cried
Lord
Henry

``
I
can
stand
brute
force

*NL*
``
I

red

Paradoxes

the
baronet

*NL*

Was

a
paradox

asked
Mr.

I

it

Well

To

we
must
see
it
on

tight
rope

*NL*
``
Dear

Harry

Mr.

give
up

the
East
End

I
assure

he
would
be

They

love
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
him
to
play
to
me

cried
Lord

smiling

he
looked

down
the
table

caught
a
bright
answering
glance

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they

so
unhappy

Lady

*NL*
*NL*

I

suffering

said
Lord

,
*NL*
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
``
I
can
not
sympathize

It
is

*NL*
ugly
,
too
horrible

too
distressing

There
is
something
terribly
*NL*
morbid
in
the
modern

One
should
sympathize
with

the
colour

the
beauty

joy

The

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Still

the
East

remarked
Sir

*NL*
with
a
grave
shake
of
the
head

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so

answered
the
young

It

the
problem

*NL*
The
politician
looked
at
him
keenly
.
``
What
change
do
you
propose

he
asked

*NL*
*NL*
Lord

laughed

``
I
do

change
anything

the
weather

he
answered

I
am
quite
content

philosophic

contemplation

But
,
as
the
nineteenth

gone
bankrupt

an
over-expenditure
of
sympathy
,
I
would
suggest
that
we
should
*NL*
appeal
to
science
to
put
us
straight
.
The
advantage
of
the
emotions
is
*NL*
that
they
lead
us
astray
,
and
the
advantage
of
science
is
that
it
is
*NL*
not
emotional

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
have
such
grave
responsibilities

''
ventured
Mrs.
Vandeleur
*NL*
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Terribly
grave
,
''
echoed
Lady
Agatha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
looked
over
at
Mr.
Erskine
.
``
Humanity
takes
itself
too
*NL*
seriously

It

original
sin

*NL*
how
to
laugh

history
would
have
been
different

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
really
very
comforting

warbled
the
duchess
.
``
I
have
always
*NL*
felt
rather
guilty
when
I
came
to
see
your

for
I
take
no

interest
at
all
in
the
East
End

For
the

I
shall
be
able
to
*NL*
look
her
in
the
face
without
a
blush

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
blush
is
very
becoming

remarked
Lord

*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
when

she
answered

``
When

it

Ah

Lord

,
I
wish
you
would
tell
*NL*
me
how
to
become
young
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
for
a
moment
.
``
Can
you
remember
any
great
error
that
you
*NL*
committed
in
your
early
days

he
asked
,
looking
at
her
across
*NL*
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
many
,
I
fear
,
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
commit
them
over
again
,
''
he
said
gravely
.
``
To
get
back
one
's
*NL*
youth

one
has
merely
to
repeat
one
's
follies

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
delightful
theory
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
I
must
put
it
into
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dangerous
theory
!
''
came
from
Sir
Thomas
's
tight
lips
.
Lady
Agatha
*NL*
shook
her
head
,
but
could
not
help
being
amused
.
Mr.
Erskine
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
continued
,
``
that
is
one
of
the
great
secrets
of
life
.
*NL*
Nowadays
most
people
die
of
a
sort
of
creeping
common
sense
,
and
*NL*
discover
when
it
is
too
late
that
the
only
things
one
never
regrets
are
*NL*
one
's
mistakes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
laugh
ran
round
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
played
with
the
idea
and
grew
wilful
;
tossed
it
into
the
air
and
*NL*
transformed
it
;
let
it
escape
and
recaptured
it
;
made
it
iridescent
*NL*
with
fancy
and
winged
it
with
paradox
.
The
praise
of
folly
,
as
he
went
*NL*
on
,
soared
into
a
philosophy
,
and
philosophy
herself
became
young
,
and
*NL*
catching
the
mad
music
of
pleasure
,
wearing
,
one
might
fancy
,
her
*NL*
wine-stained
robe
and
wreath
of
ivy
,
danced
like
a
Bacchante
over
the
*NL*
hills
of
life
,
and
mocked
the
slow
Silenus
for
being
sober
.
Facts
fled
*NL*
before
her
like
frightened
forest
things
.
Her
white
feet
trod
the
huge
*NL*
press
at
which
wise
Omar
sits
,
till
the
seething
grape-juice
rose
round
*NL*
her
bare
limbs
in
waves
of
purple
bubbles
,
or
crawled
in
red
foam
over
*NL*
the
vat
's
black
,
dripping
,
sloping
sides
.
It
was
an
extraordinary
*NL*
improvisation
.
He
felt
that
the
eyes
of
Dorian
Gray
were
fixed
on
him
,
*NL*
and
the
consciousness
that
amongst
his
audience
there
was
one
whose
*NL*
temperament
he
wished
to
fascinate
seemed
to
give
his
wit
keenness
and
*NL*
to
lend
colour
to
his
imagination
.
He
was
brilliant
,
fantastic
,
*NL*
irresponsible
.
He
charmed
his
listeners
out
of
themselves
,
and
they
*NL*
followed
his
pipe
,
laughing
.
Dorian
Gray
never
took
his
gaze
off
him
,
*NL*
but
sat
like
one
under
a
spell
,
smiles
chasing
each
other
over
his
lips
*NL*
and
wonder
growing
grave
in
his
darkening
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
liveried
in
the
costume
of
the
age
,
reality
entered
the
room
*NL*
in
the
shape
of
a
servant
to
tell
the
duchess
that
her
carriage
was
*NL*
waiting
.
She
wrung
her
hands
in
mock
despair
.
``
How
annoying
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
.
``
I
must
go

I
have

call
for

club

take

him

absurd
meeting
at
Willis
's
Rooms

where
he
is
going

be

in

chair

If
I
am
late
he
is
sure
to
be
furious

I
could

a
scene
in

*NL*
``
For
you

Lord

with
a

bow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

nice

very
wrong

she
cried
;
``

she
swept
out
of
the
room

followed
by
Lady
Agatha

the
*NL*
other
ladies

*NL*
*NL*
When
Lord

had
sat
down
again
,
Mr.
Erskine
moved
round
,
and
taking
*NL*
a
chair
close
to
him

placed
his
hand
upon
his
arm

*NL*
*NL*
``

``
I

fond

write
a

Persian
carpet

as
unreal

But
there

*NL*
``
I

answered
Mr.

``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

possess

*NL*

Lord

laughed

rose

cried

*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
passing
out

Dorian

touched
him
on

arm

``
Let
me
come
with
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
you
had
promised
Basil
Hallward
to
go
and
see
him

*NL*
answered
Lord
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
sooner
come
with
you

yes

I
feel
I
must
come
with
you

Do

let
me
.
And
you
will
promise
to
talk
to
me
all
the
time
?
No
one
talks
*NL*
so
wonderfully
as
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
have
talked
quite
enough
for
to-day

''
said
Lord
Henry
,
smiling
.
*NL*
``
All
I
want
now
is
to
look
at
life

come
and
look
at
it
with

you
care

CHAPTER
4
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
a
month
later
,
Dorian
Gray
was
reclining
in
a
luxurious
*NL*
arm-chair
,
in
the
little
library
of
Lord
Henry
's
house
in
Mayfair
.
It
*NL*
was
,
in
its
way
,
a
very
charming
room
,
with
its
high
panelled
*NL*
wainscoting
of
olive-stained
oak
,
its
cream-coloured
frieze
and
ceiling
*NL*
of
raised
plasterwork
,
and
its
brickdust
felt
carpet
strewn
with
silk
,
*NL*
long-fringed
Persian
rugs
.
On
a
tiny
satinwood
table
stood
a
statuette
*NL*
by
Clodion
,
and
beside
it
lay
a
copy
of
Les
Cent
Nouvelles
,
bound
for
*NL*
Margaret
of
Valois
by
Clovis
Eve
and
powdered
with
the
gilt
daisies
*NL*
that
Queen
had
selected
for
her
device
.
Some
large
blue
china
jars
and
*NL*
parrot-tulips
were
ranged
on
the
mantelshelf
,
and
through
the
small
*NL*
leaded
panes
of
the
window
streamed
the
apricot-coloured
light
of
a
*NL*
summer
day
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
had
not
yet
come
in
.
He
was
always
late
on
principle
,
his
*NL*
principle
being
that
punctuality
is
the
thief
of
time
.
So
the
lad
was
*NL*
looking
rather
sulky
,
as
with
listless
fingers
he
turned
over
the
pages
*NL*
of
an
elaborately
illustrated
edition
of
Manon
Lescaut
that
he
had
*NL*
found
in
one
of
the
book-cases
.
The
formal
monotonous
ticking
of
the
*NL*
Louis
Quatorze
clock
annoyed
him
.
Once
or
twice
he
thought
of
going
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
heard
a
step
outside
,
and
the
door
opened
.
``
How
late
you
*NL*
are
,
Harry
!
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
it
is
not
Harry
,
Mr.
Gray
,
''
answered
a
shrill
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
quickly
round
and
rose
to
his
feet
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon
.
I
*NL*
thought
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
it
was
my
husband
.
It
is
only
his
wife
.
You
must
let
me
*NL*
introduce
myself
.
I
know
you
quite
well
by
your
photographs
.
I
think
*NL*
my
husband
has
got
seventeen
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
seventeen
,
Lady
Henry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
eighteen
,
then
.
And
I
saw
you
with
him
the
other
night
at
the
*NL*
opera
.
''
She
laughed
nervously
as
she
spoke
,
and
watched
him
with
her
*NL*
vague
forget-me-not
eyes
.
She
was
a
curious
woman
,
whose
dresses
*NL*
always
looked
as
if
they
had
been
designed
in
a
rage
and
put
on
in
a
*NL*
tempest
.
She
was
usually
in
love
with
somebody
,
and
,
as
her
passion
*NL*
was
never
returned
,
she
had
kept
all
her
illusions
.
She
tried
to
look
*NL*
picturesque
,
but
only
succeeded
in
being
untidy
.
Her
name
was
*NL*
Victoria
,
and
she
had
a
perfect
mania
for
going
to
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
at
Lohengrin
,
Lady
Henry
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
was
at
dear
Lohengrin
.
I
like
Wagner
's
music
better
than
*NL*
anybody
's
.
It
is
so
loud
that
one
can
talk
the
whole
time
without
other
*NL*
people
hearing
what
one
says
.
That
is
a
great
advantage
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
think
so
,
Mr.
Gray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
nervous
staccato
laugh
broke
from
her
thin
lips
,
and
her
*NL*
fingers
began
to
play
with
a
long
tortoise-shell
paper-knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
smiled
and
shook
his
head
:
``
I
am
afraid
I
do
n't
think
so
,
Lady
*NL*
Henry
.
I
never
talk
during
music
--
at
least
,
during
good
music
.
If
one
*NL*
hears
bad
music
,
it
is
one
's
duty
to
drown
it
in
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
that
is
one
of
Harry
's
views
,
is
n't
it
,
Mr.
Gray
?
I
always
hear
*NL*
Harry
's
views
from
his
friends
.
It
is
the
only
way
I
get
to
know
of
*NL*
them
.
But
you
must
not
think
I
do
n't
like
good
music
.
I
adore
it
,
but
*NL*
I
am
afraid
of
it
.
It
makes
me
too
romantic
.
I
have
simply
worshipped
*NL*
pianists
--
two
at
a
time
,
sometimes
,
Harry
tells
me
.
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
it
is
about
them
.
Perhaps
it
is
that
they
are
foreigners
.
They
all
*NL*
are
,
ai
n't
they
?
Even
those
that
are
born
in
England
become
foreigners
*NL*
after
a
time
,
do
n't
they
?
It
is
so
clever
of
them
,
and
such
a
*NL*
compliment
to
art
.
Makes
it
quite
cosmopolitan
,
does
n't
it
?
You
have
*NL*
never
been
to
any
of
my
parties
,
have
you
,
Mr.
Gray
?
You
must
come
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
afford
orchids
,
but
I
spare
no
expense
in
foreigners
.
They
make
*NL*
one
's
rooms
look
so
picturesque
.
But
here
is
Harry
!
Harry
,
I
came
in
*NL*
to
look
for
you
,
to
ask
you
something
--
I
forget
what
it
was
--
and
I
*NL*
found
Mr.
Gray
here
.
We
have
had
such
a
pleasant
chat
about
music
.
We
*NL*
have
quite
the
same
ideas
.
No
;
I
think
our
ideas
are
quite
different
.
*NL*
But
he
has
been
most
pleasant
.
I
am
so
glad
I
've
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
charmed
,
my
love
,
quite
charmed
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
elevating
his
*NL*
dark
,
crescent-shaped
eyebrows
and
looking
at
them
both
with
an
amused
*NL*
smile
.
``
So
sorry
I
am
late
,
Dorian
.
I
went
to
look
after
a
piece
of
*NL*
old
brocade
in
Wardour
Street
and
had
to
bargain
for
hours
for
it
.
*NL*
Nowadays
people
know
the
price
of
everything
and
the
value
of
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
must
be
going
,
''
exclaimed
Lady
Henry
,
breaking
an
*NL*
awkward
silence
with
her
silly
sudden
laugh
.
``
I
have
promised
to
drive
*NL*
with
the
duchess
.
Good-bye
,
Mr.
Gray
.
Good-bye
,
Harry
.
You
are
*NL*
dining
out
,
I
suppose
?
So
am
I.
Perhaps
I
shall
see
you
at
Lady
*NL*
Thornbury
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
shutting
the
door
behind
her
*NL*
as
,
looking
like
a
bird
of
paradise
that
had
been
out
all
night
in
the
*NL*
rain
,
she
flitted
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
a
faint
odour
of
*NL*
frangipanni
.
Then
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
flung
himself
down
on
the
*NL*
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
marry
a
woman
with
straw-coloured
hair
,
Dorian

he
said
after
a
*NL*
few
puffs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Harry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
they
are
so
sentimental

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
like
sentimental
people

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
marry
at
all

Dorian

are
disappointed

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

likely

am
too
much
in
love

That
is
one
of
your
aphorisms

I
am
putting
it
into
practice
,
as
I
do
*NL*
everything
that
you
say

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
in
love
with
?

asked
Lord
Henry
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
an
actress
,
''
said
Dorian
Gray
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
That
is
a
rather
commonplace
*NL*
_
debut
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not
say
so
if
you
saw
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her

``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

no
woman

Women
are
a
decorative
sex
.
They
*NL*
never
have
anything
to
say
,
but
they
say
it
charmingly
.
Women
*NL*
represent
the
triumph
of
matter
over
mind
,
just
as
men
represent
the
*NL*
triumph
of
mind
over

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harry
,
how
can
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Dorian
,
it
is
quite
true
.
I
am
analysing
women
at
present
,
so
*NL*
I
ought
to
know
.
The
subject
is
not
so
abstruse
as
I
thought
it
was
.
*NL*
I
find
that
,
ultimately
,
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
women
,
the
plain
*NL*
and
the
coloured
.
The
plain
women
are
very
useful
.
If
you
want
to
*NL*
gain
a
reputation
for
respectability
,
you
have
merely
to
take
them
down
*NL*
to
supper
.
The
other
women
are
very
charming
.
They
commit
one
*NL*
mistake
,
however
.
They
paint
in
order
to
try
and
look
young
.
Our
*NL*
grandmothers
painted
in
order
to
try
and
talk
brilliantly
.
_
Rouge
_
and
*NL*
_
esprit
_
used
to
go
together
.
That
is
all
over
now
.
As
long
as
a
woman
*NL*
can
look
ten
years
younger
than
her
own
daughter
,
she
is
perfectly
*NL*
satisfied
.
As
for
conversation
,
there
are
only
five
women
in
London
*NL*
worth
talking
to
,
and
two
of
these
ca
n't
be
admitted
into
decent
*NL*
society
.
However
,
tell
me
about
your
genius
.
How
long
have
you
known
*NL*
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Harry
,
your
views
terrify
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
that
.
How
long
have
you
known
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
three
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
did
you
come
across
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
,
Harry
,
but
you
must
n't
be
unsympathetic
about
it
.
*NL*
After
all
,
it
never
would
have
happened
if
I
had
not
met
you
.
You
*NL*
filled
me
with
a
wild
desire
to
know
everything
about
life
.
For
days
*NL*
after
I
met
you
,
something
seemed
to
throb
in
my
veins
.
As
I
lounged
*NL*
in
the
park
,
or
strolled
down
Piccadilly
,
I
used
to
look
at
every
one
*NL*
who
passed
me
and
wonder
,
with
a
mad
curiosity
,
what
sort
of
lives
they
*NL*
led
.
Some
of
them
fascinated
me
.
Others
filled
me
with
terror
.
There
*NL*
was
an
exquisite
poison
in
the
air
.
I
had
a
passion
for
sensations
...
*NL*
Well
,
one
evening
about
seven
o'clock
,
I
determined
to
go
out
in
search
*NL*
of
some
adventure
.
I
felt
that
this
grey
monstrous
London
of
ours
,
*NL*
with
its
myriads
of
people
,
its
sordid
sinners
,
and
its
splendid
sins
,
*NL*
as
you
once
phrased
it
,
must
have
something
in
store
for
me
.
I
fancied
*NL*
a
thousand
things
.
The
mere
danger
gave
me
a
sense
of
delight
.
I
*NL*
remembered
what
you
had
said
to
me
on
that
wonderful
evening
when
we
*NL*
first
dined
together
,
about
the
search
for
beauty
being
the
real
secret
*NL*
of
life
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
expected
,
but
I
went
out
and
wandered
*NL*
eastward
,
soon
losing
my
way
in
a
labyrinth
of
grimy
streets
and
black
*NL*
grassless
squares
.
About
half-past
eight
I
passed
by
an
absurd
little
*NL*
theatre
,
with
great
flaring
gas-jets
and
gaudy
play-bills
.
A
hideous
*NL*
Jew
,
in
the
most
amazing
waistcoat
I
ever
beheld
in
my
life
,
was
*NL*
standing
at
the
entrance
,
smoking
a
vile
cigar
.
He
had
greasy
*NL*
ringlets
,
and
an
enormous
diamond
blazed
in
the
centre
of
a
soiled
*NL*
shirt
.
`
Have
a
box
,
my
Lord
?
'
he
said
,
when
he
saw
me
,
and
he
took
off
*NL*
his
hat
with
an
air
of
gorgeous
servility
.
There
was
something
about
*NL*
him
,
Harry
,
that
amused
me
.
He
was
such
a
monster
.
You
will
laugh
at
*NL*
me
,
I
know
,
but
I
really
went
in
and
paid
a
whole
guinea
for
the
*NL*
stage-box
.
To
the
present
day
I
ca
n't
make
out
why
I
did
so
;
and
yet
if
*NL*
I
had
n't
--
my
dear
Harry
,
if
I
had
n't
--
I
should
have
missed
the
greatest
*NL*
romance
of
my
life
.
I
see
you
are
laughing
.
It
is
horrid
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
laughing

Dorian

at
least
I
am
not
laughing
at
you

you
*NL*

not
say
the
greatest
romance
of
your
life

You
should
say
the
*NL*
first
romance
of
your
life

You
will
always
be
loved
,
and
you
will
*NL*
always
be

with
love

A
_
grande
passion

is
the
privilege

people
who
have
nothing
to
do

That
is
the
one
use
of
the
idle
classes
*NL*
of
a
country

Do
n't
be

There
are
exquisite
things
in

they
call
their
loyalty
,
and
their
fidelity
,
*NL*
I
call
either
the
lethargy
of
custom
or
their
lack
of
imagination
.
*NL*
Faithfulness
is
to
the
emotional
life
what
consistency
is
to
the
life
*NL*
of
the
intellect
--
simply
a
confession
of
failure
.
Faithfulness
!
I
*NL*
must
analyse
it
some
day
.
The
passion
for
property
is
in
it
.
There
*NL*
are
many
things
that
we
would
throw
away
if
we
were
not
afraid
that
*NL*
others
might
pick
them
up
.
But
I
do
n't
want
to
interrupt
you
.
Go
on
*NL*
with
your
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
found
myself
seated
in
a
horrid
little
private
box
,
with
a
*NL*
vulgar
drop-scene
staring
me
in
the
face
.
I
looked
out
from
behind
the
*NL*
curtain
and
surveyed
the
house
.
It
was
a
tawdry
affair
,
all
Cupids
and
*NL*
cornucopias
,
like
a
third-rate
wedding-cake
.
The
gallery
and
pit
were
*NL*
fairly
full
,
but
the
two
rows
of
dingy
stalls
were
quite
empty
,
and
*NL*
there
was
hardly
a
person
in
what
I
suppose
they
called
the
*NL*
dress-circle
.
Women
went
about
with
oranges
and
ginger-beer
,
and
there
*NL*
was
a
terrible
consumption
of
nuts
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
have
been
just
like
the
palmy
days
of
the
British
drama
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
like
,
I
should
fancy
,
and
very
depressing
.
I
began
to
wonder
*NL*
what
on
earth
I
should
do
when
I
caught
sight
of
the
play-bill
.
What
*NL*
do
you
think
the
play
was
,
Harry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
`
The
Idiot
Boy
'
,
or
`
Dumb
but
Innocent
'
.
Our
fathers
*NL*
used
to
like
that
sort
of
piece
,
I
believe
.
The
longer
I
live
,
Dorian
,
*NL*
the
more
keenly
I
feel
that
whatever
was
good
enough
for
our
fathers
is
*NL*
not
good
enough
for
us
.
In
art
,
as
in
politics
,
_
les
grandperes
ont
*NL*
toujours
tort
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
play
was
good
enough
for
us
,
Harry
.
It
was
Romeo
and
Juliet
.
I
*NL*
must
admit
that
I
was
rather
annoyed
at
the
idea
of
seeing
Shakespeare
*NL*
done
in
such
a
wretched
hole
of
a
place
.
Still
,
I
felt
interested
,
in
*NL*
a
sort
of
way
.
At
any
rate
,
I
determined
to
wait
for
the
first
act
.
*NL*
There
was
a
dreadful
orchestra
,
presided
over
by
a
young
Hebrew
who
sat
*NL*
at
a
cracked
piano
,
that
nearly
drove
me
away
,
but
at
last
the
*NL*
drop-scene
was
drawn
up
and
the
play
began
.
Romeo
was
a
stout
elderly
*NL*
gentleman
,
with
corked
eyebrows
,
a
husky
tragedy
voice
,
and
a
figure
*NL*
like
a
beer-barrel
.
Mercutio
was
almost
as
bad
.
He
was
played
by
the
*NL*
low-comedian
,
who
had
introduced
gags
of
his
own
and
was
on
most
*NL*
friendly
terms
with
the
pit
.
They
were
both
as
grotesque
as
the
*NL*
scenery
,
and
that
looked
as
if
it
had
come
out
of
a
country-booth
.
But
*NL*
Juliet
!
Harry
,
imagine
a
girl
,
hardly
seventeen
years
of
age
,
with
a
*NL*
little
,
flowerlike
face
,
a
small
Greek
head
with
plaited
coils
of
*NL*
dark-brown
hair
,
eyes
that
were
violet
wells
of
passion
,
lips
that
were
*NL*
like
the
petals
of
a
rose
.
She
was
the
loveliest
thing
I
had
ever
seen
*NL*
in
my
life
.
You
said
to
me
once
that
pathos
left
you
unmoved
,
but
that
*NL*
beauty
,
mere
beauty
,
could
fill
your
eyes
with
tears
.
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
Harry
,
I
could
hardly
see
this
girl
for
the
mist
of
tears
that
came
*NL*
across
me
.
And
her
voice
--
I
never
heard
such
a
voice
.
It
was
very
low
*NL*
at
first
,
with
deep
mellow
notes
that
seemed
to
fall
singly
upon
one
's
*NL*
ear
.
Then
it
became
a
little
louder
,
and
sounded
like
a
flute
or
a
*NL*
distant
hautboy
.
In
the
garden-scene
it
had
all
the
tremulous
ecstasy
*NL*
that
one
hears
just
before
dawn
when
nightingales
are
singing
.
There
*NL*
were
moments
,
later
on
,
when
it
had
the
wild
passion
of
violins
.
You
*NL*
know
how
a
voice
can
stir
one
.
Your
voice
and
the
voice
of
Sibyl
Vane
*NL*
are
two
things
that
I
shall
never
forget
.
When
I
close
my
eyes
,
I
hear
*NL*
them
,
and
each
of
them
says
something
different
.
I
do
n't
know
which
to
*NL*
follow
.
Why
should
I
not
love
her
?
Harry
,
I
do
love
her
.
She
is
*NL*
everything
to
me
in
life
.
Night
after
night
I
go
to
see
her
play
.
One
*NL*
evening
she
is
Rosalind
,
and
the
next
evening
she
is
Imogen
.
I
have
*NL*
seen
her
die
in
the
gloom
of
an
Italian
tomb
,
sucking
the
poison
from
*NL*
her
lover
's
lips
.
I
have
watched
her
wandering
through
the
forest
of
*NL*
Arden
,
disguised
as
a
pretty
boy
in
hose
and
doublet
and
dainty
cap
.
*NL*
She
has
been
mad
,
and
has
come
into
the
presence
of
a
guilty
king
,
and
*NL*
given
him
rue
to
wear
and
bitter
herbs
to
taste
of
.
She
has
been
*NL*
innocent
,
and
the
black
hands
of
jealousy
have
crushed
her
reedlike
*NL*
throat
.
I
have
seen
her
in
every
age
and
in
every
costume
.
Ordinary
*NL*
women
never
appeal
to
one
's
imagination
.
They
are
limited
to
their
*NL*
century
.
No
glamour
ever
transfigures
them
.
One
knows
their
minds
as
*NL*
easily
as
one
knows
their
bonnets
.
One
can
always
find
them
.
There
is
*NL*
no
mystery
in
any
of
them
.
They
ride
in
the
park
in
the
morning
and
*NL*
chatter
at
tea-parties
in
the
afternoon
.
They
have
their
stereotyped
*NL*
smile
and
their
fashionable
manner
.
They
are
quite
obvious
.
But
an
*NL*
actress
!
How
different
an
actress
is
!
Harry
!
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
*NL*
that
the
only
thing
worth
loving
is
an
actress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
loved
so
many
of
them
,
Dorian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

people
with
dyed
hair
and
painted
faces

*NL*

``
Do
n't
run
down
dyed
hair

said
Lord
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
now

had
not
told
you
about
Sibyl
Vane

*NL*
``

would

it
to
you

matches
,
like

are
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
leaped
to
his
feet
,
with
flushed
cheeks
and
burning
eyes
.
*NL*
``
Harry

Vane
is
sacred

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
the
sacred
things

said
*NL*
Lord
Henry
,
with
a
strange
touch
of
pathos
in
his
voice
.
``
But
why
*NL*
should
you
be
annoyed
?
I
suppose
she
will
belong
to
you
some
day
.
*NL*
When
one
is
in
love
,
one
always
begins
by
deceiving
one
's
self
,
and
one
*NL*
always
ends
by
deceiving
others
.
That
is
what
the
world
calls
a
*NL*
romance
.
You
know
her
,
at
any
rate
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
know
her
.
On
the
first
night
I
was
at
the
theatre
,
the
*NL*
horrid
old
Jew
came
round
to
the
box
after
the
performance
was
over
and
*NL*
offered
to
take
me
behind
the
scenes
and
introduce
me
to
her
.
I
was
*NL*
furious
with
him
,
and
told
him
that
Juliet
had
been
dead
for
hundreds
*NL*
of
years
and
that
her
body
was
lying
in
a
marble
tomb
in
Verona
.
I
*NL*
think
,
from
his
blank
look
of
amazement
,
that
he
was
under
the
*NL*
impression
that
I
had
taken
too
much
champagne
,
or
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
surprised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
asked
me
if
I
wrote
for
any
of
the
newspapers
.
I
told
him
I
*NL*
never
even
read
them
.
He
seemed
terribly
disappointed
at
that
,
and
*NL*
confided
to
me
that
all
the
dramatic
critics
were
in
a
conspiracy
*NL*
against
him
,
and
that
they
were
every
one
of
them
to
be
bought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
wonder
if
he
was
quite
right
there
.
But
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
judging
from
their
appearance
,
most
of
them
can
not
be
at
all
*NL*
expensive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
seemed
to
think
they
were
beyond
his
means

laughed
Dorian
.
*NL*
``
By
this
time
,
however
,
the
lights
were
being
put
out
in
the
theatre

*NL*

I
had
to
go
.
He
wanted
me
to
try
some
cigars
that
he
strongly
*NL*
recommended
.
I
declined
.
The
next
night
,
of
course
,
I
arrived
at
the
*NL*
place
again

When
he
saw
me
,
he
made
me
a
low
bow
and
assured
me
that
*NL*
I
was
a
munificent
patron
of
art
.
He
was
a
most
offensive
brute
,
*NL*
though
he
had
an
extraordinary
passion
for
Shakespeare
.
He
told
me
*NL*
once
,
with
an
air
of
pride
,
that
his
five
bankruptcies
were
entirely
*NL*
due
to
`
The
Bard

he
insisted
on
calling
him

seemed

think

it
a
distinction

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
distinction

my

great
distinction

Most

become
bankrupt
through
having
invested
too
heavily
in
the
prose
*NL*
of
life

To
have
ruined
one

self
over
poetry

an
honour

But
when

did
you
first
speak
to
Miss
Sibyl
Vane

*NL*
``
The
third
night

She
had
been
playing
Rosalind

I
could
not
help
*NL*
going
round

I
had
thrown
her
some
flowers
,
and
she
had
looked
at
*NL*
me
--
at
least
I
fancied
that
she
had
.
The
old
Jew
was
persistent
.
He
*NL*
seemed
determined
to
take
me
behind
,
so
I
consented

It
was
curious
my
*NL*
not
wanting
to
know

``
Sibyl
?
Oh
,
she
was
so
shy
and
so
gentle

There
is
something
of
a
*NL*
child
about
her
.
Her
eyes
opened
wide
in
exquisite
wonder
when
I
told
*NL*
her
what
I
thought
of
her
performance
,
and
she
seemed
quite
unconscious
*NL*
of
her
power
.
I
think
we
were
both
rather
nervous
.
The
old
Jew
stood
*NL*
grinning
at
the
doorway
of
the
dusty
greenroom
,
making
elaborate
*NL*
speeches
about
us
both
,
while
we
stood
looking
at
each
other
like
*NL*
children

He
would
insist
on
calling
me
`
My
Lord
,
'
so
I
had
to
assure
*NL*
Sibyl
that
I
was
not
anything
of
the
kind

She
said
quite
simply
to
*NL*
me

`
You
look
more

must
call

Prince
Charming

knows
nothing

lives
with

faded

played
Lady

He
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
as
he
*NL*
spoke
.
Hectic
spots
of
red
burned
on
his
cheeks
.
He
was
terribly
*NL*
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
watched
him
with
a
subtle
sense
of
pleasure
.
How
different
*NL*
he
was
now
from
the
shy
frightened
boy
he
had
met
in
Basil
Hallward
's
*NL*
studio
!
His
nature
had
developed
like
a
flower
,
had
borne
blossoms
of
*NL*
scarlet
flame
.
Out
of
its
secret
hiding-place
had
crept
his
soul
,
and
*NL*
desire
had
come
to
meet
it
on
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
propose
to
do
?
''
said
Lord
Henry
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you

Basil

come
with
me
some
night

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Basil
!
I
have
not
laid
eyes
on
him
for
a
week
.
It
is
rather
*NL*
horrid
of
me
,
as
he
has
sent
me
my
portrait
in
the
most
wonderful
*NL*
frame
,
specially
designed
by
himself
,
and
,
though
I
am
a
little
jealous
*NL*
of
the
picture
for
being
a
whole
month
younger
than
I
am
,
I
must
admit
*NL*
that
I
delight
in
it
.
Perhaps
you
had
better
write
to
him
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
see
him
alone
.
He
says
things
that
annoy
me
.
He
gives
me
good
*NL*
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
smiled
.
``
People
are
very
fond
of
giving
away
what
they
need
*NL*
most
themselves

It
is
what
I
call
the
depth
of
generosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Basil
is
the
best
of
fellows
,
but
he
seems
to
me
to
be
just
a
bit
*NL*
of
a
Philistine
.
Since
I
have
known
you
,
Harry
,
I
have
discovered
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Basil
,
my
dear
boy
,
puts
everything
that
is
charming
in
him
into
his
*NL*
work
.
The
consequence
is
that
he
has
nothing
left
for
life
but
his
*NL*
prejudices
,
his
principles
,
and
his
common
sense
.
The
only
artists
I
*NL*
have
ever
known
who
are
personally
delightful
are
bad
artists
.
Good
*NL*
artists
exist
simply
in
what
they
make
,
and
consequently
are
perfectly
*NL*
uninteresting
in
what
they
are
.
A
great
poet
,
a
really
great
poet
,
is
*NL*
the
most
unpoetical
of
all
creatures
.
But
inferior
poets
are
*NL*
absolutely
fascinating
.
The
worse
their
rhymes
are
,
the
more
*NL*
picturesque
they
look
.
The
mere
fact
of
having
published
a
book
of
*NL*
second-rate
sonnets
makes
a
man
quite
irresistible
.
He
lives
the
*NL*
poetry
that
he
can
not
write
.
The
others
write
the
poetry
that
they
*NL*
dare
not
realize
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
is
that
really
so
,
Harry
?
''
said
Dorian
Gray
,
putting
some
*NL*
perfume
on
his
handkerchief
out
of
a
large
,
gold-topped
bottle
that
*NL*
stood
on
the
table
.
``
It
must
be
,
if
you
say
it
.
And
now
I
am
off
.
*NL*
Imogen
is
waiting
for
me
.
Do
n't
forget
about
to-morrow
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
left
the
room
,
Lord
Henry
's
heavy
eyelids
drooped
,
and
he
began
*NL*
to
think
.
Certainly
few
people
had
ever
interested
him
so
much
as
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
,
and
yet
the
lad
's
mad
adoration
of
some
one
else
caused
*NL*
him
not
the
slightest
pang
of
annoyance
or
jealousy
.
He
was
pleased
by
*NL*
it
.
It
made
him
a
more
interesting
study
.
He
had
been
always
*NL*
enthralled
by
the
methods
of
natural
science
,
but
the
ordinary
*NL*
subject-matter
of
that
science
had
seemed
to
him
trivial
and
of
no
*NL*
import
.
And
so
he
had
begun
by
vivisecting
himself
,
as
he
had
ended
by
*NL*
vivisecting
others
.
Human
life
--
that
appeared
to
him
the
one
thing
*NL*
worth
investigating
.
Compared
to
it
there
was
nothing
else
of
any
*NL*
value
.
It
was
true
that
as
one
watched
life
in
its
curious
crucible
of
*NL*
pain
and
pleasure
,
one
could
not
wear
over
one
's
face
a
mask
of
glass
,
*NL*
nor
keep
the
sulphurous
fumes
from
troubling
the
brain
and
making
the
*NL*
imagination
turbid
with
monstrous
fancies
and
misshapen
dreams
.
There
*NL*
were
poisons
so
subtle
that
to
know
their
properties
one
had
to
sicken
*NL*
of
them
.
There
were
maladies
so
strange
that
one
had
to
pass
through
*NL*
them
if
one
sought
to
understand
their
nature
.
And
,
yet
,
what
a
great
*NL*
reward
one
received
!
How
wonderful
the
whole
world
became
to
one
!
To
*NL*
note
the
curious
hard
logic
of
passion
,
and
the
emotional
coloured
life
*NL*
of
the
intellect
--
to
observe
where
they
met
,
and
where
they
separated
,
*NL*
at
what
point
they
were
in
unison
,
and
at
what
point
they
were
at
*NL*
discord
--
there
was
a
delight
in
that
!
What
matter
what
the
cost
was
?
*NL*
One
could
never
pay
too
high
a
price
for
any
sensation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
conscious
--
and
the
thought
brought
a
gleam
of
pleasure
into
his
*NL*
brown
agate
eyes
--
that
it
was
through
certain
words
of
his
,
musical
*NL*
words
said
with
musical
utterance
,
that
Dorian
Gray
's
soul
had
turned
*NL*
to
this
white
girl
and
bowed
in
worship
before
her
.
To
a
large
extent
*NL*
the
lad
was
his
own
creation
.
He
had
made
him
premature
.
That
was
*NL*
something
.
Ordinary
people
waited
till
life
disclosed
to
them
its
*NL*
secrets
,
but
to
the
few
,
to
the
elect
,
the
mysteries
of
life
were
*NL*
revealed
before
the
veil
was
drawn
away
.
Sometimes
this
was
the
effect
*NL*
of
art
,
and
chiefly
of
the
art
of
literature
,
which
dealt
immediately
*NL*
with
the
passions
and
the
intellect
.
But
now
and
then
a
complex
*NL*
personality
took
the
place
and
assumed
the
office
of
art
,
was
indeed
,
*NL*
in
its
way
,
a
real
work
of
art
,
life
having
its
elaborate
masterpieces
,
*NL*
just
as
poetry
has
,
or
sculpture
,
or
painting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
the
lad
was
premature
.
He
was
gathering
his
harvest
while
it
was
*NL*
yet
spring
.
The
pulse
and
passion
of
youth
were
in
him
,
but
he
was
*NL*
becoming
self-conscious
.
It
was
delightful
to
watch
him
.
With
his
*NL*
beautiful
face
,
and
his
beautiful
soul
,
he
was
a
thing
to
wonder
at
.
*NL*
It
was
no
matter
how
it
all
ended
,
or
was
destined
to
end
.
He
was
like
*NL*
one
of
those
gracious
figures
in
a
pageant
or
a
play
,
whose
joys
seem
*NL*
to
be
remote
from
one
,
but
whose
sorrows
stir
one
's
sense
of
beauty
,
*NL*
and
whose
wounds
are
like
red
roses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soul
and
body
,
body
and
soul
--
how
mysterious
they
were
!
There
was
*NL*
animalism
in
the
soul
,
and
the
body
had
its
moments
of
spirituality
.
*NL*
The
senses
could
refine
,
and
the
intellect
could
degrade
.
Who
could
*NL*
say
where
the
fleshly
impulse
ceased
,
or
the
psychical
impulse
began
?
*NL*
How
shallow
were
the
arbitrary
definitions
of
ordinary
psychologists
!
*NL*
And
yet
how
difficult
to
decide
between
the
claims
of
the
various
*NL*
schools
!
Was
the
soul
a
shadow
seated
in
the
house
of
sin
?
Or
was
the
*NL*
body
really
in
the
soul
,
as
Giordano
Bruno
thought
?
The
separation
of
*NL*
spirit
from
matter
was
a
mystery
,
and
the
union
of
spirit
with
matter
*NL*
was
a
mystery
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
wonder
whether
we
could
ever
make
psychology
so
absolute
a
*NL*
science
that
each
little
spring
of
life
would
be
revealed
to
us
.
As
it
*NL*
was
,
we
always
misunderstood
ourselves
and
rarely
understood
others
.
*NL*
Experience
was
of
no
ethical
value
.
It
was
merely
the
name
men
gave
to
*NL*
their
mistakes
.
Moralists
had
,
as
a
rule
,
regarded
it
as
a
mode
of
*NL*
warning
,
had
claimed
for
it
a
certain
ethical
efficacy
in
the
formation
*NL*
of
character
,
had
praised
it
as
something
that
taught
us
what
to
follow
*NL*
and
showed
us
what
to
avoid
.
But
there
was
no
motive
power
in
*NL*
experience
.
It
was
as
little
of
an
active
cause
as
conscience
itself
.
*NL*
All
that
it
really
demonstrated
was
that
our
future
would
be
the
same
*NL*
as
our
past
,
and
that
the
sin
we
had
done
once
,
and
with
loathing
,
we
*NL*
would
do
many
times
,
and
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
clear
to
him
that
the
experimental
method
was
the
only
method
by
*NL*
which
one
could
arrive
at
any
scientific
analysis
of
the
passions
;
and
*NL*
certainly
Dorian
Gray
was
a
subject
made
to
his
hand
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
promise
rich
and
fruitful
results
.
His
sudden
mad
love
for
Sibyl
Vane
*NL*
was
a
psychological
phenomenon
of
no
small
interest
.
There
was
no
*NL*
doubt
that
curiosity
had
much
to
do
with
it
,
curiosity
and
the
desire
*NL*
for
new
experiences
,
yet
it
was
not
a
simple
,
but
rather
a
very
complex
*NL*
passion
.
What
there
was
in
it
of
the
purely
sensuous
instinct
of
*NL*
boyhood
had
been
transformed
by
the
workings
of
the
imagination
,
*NL*
changed
into
something
that
seemed
to
the
lad
himself
to
be
remote
from
*NL*
sense
,
and
was
for
that
very
reason
all
the
more
dangerous
.
It
was
the
*NL*
passions
about
whose
origin
we
deceived
ourselves
that
tyrannized
most
*NL*
strongly
over
us
.
Our
weakest
motives
were
those
of
whose
nature
we
*NL*
were
conscious
.
It
often
happened
that
when
we
thought
we
were
*NL*
experimenting
on
others
we
were
really
experimenting
on
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Lord
Henry
sat
dreaming
on
these
things
,
a
knock
came
to
the
*NL*
door
,
and
his
valet
entered
and
reminded
him
it
was
time
to
dress
for
*NL*
dinner
.
He
got
up
and
looked
out
into
the
street
.
The
sunset
had
*NL*
smitten
into
scarlet
gold
the
upper
windows
of
the
houses
opposite
.
*NL*
The
panes
glowed
like
plates
of
heated
metal
.
The
sky
above
was
like
a
*NL*
faded
rose
.
He
thought
of
his
friend
's
young
fiery-coloured
life
and
*NL*
wondered
how
it
was
all
going
to
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
arrived
home
,
about
half-past
twelve
o'clock
,
he
saw
a
telegram
*NL*
lying
on
the
hall
table
.
He
opened
it
and
found
it
was
from
Dorian
*NL*
Gray
.
It
was
to
tell
him
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
Sibyl
*NL*
Vane
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
Mother
,
I
am
so
happy
!
''
whispered
the
girl
,
burying
her
face
*NL*
in
the
lap
of
the
faded
,
tired-looking
woman
who
,
with
back
turned
to
*NL*
the
shrill
intrusive
light
,
was
sitting
in
the
one
arm-chair
that
their
*NL*
dingy
sitting-room
contained
.
``
I
am
so
happy

''
she
repeated
,
``
and
you
*NL*
must
be
happy
,
too
!

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Vane
winced
and
put
her
thin
,
bismuth-whitened
hands
on
her
*NL*
daughter
's
head
.
``
Happy
!
''
she
echoed
,
``
I
am
only
happy
,
Sibyl
,
when
I
*NL*
see
you
act

You
must
not
think
of
anything
but
your
acting

Mr.
*NL*
Isaacs
has
been
very
good
to
us
,
and
we
owe
him
money

*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
looked
up
and
pouted
.
``
Money
,
Mother
?
''
she
cried
,
``
what
does
*NL*
money
matter
?
Love
is
more
than
money

Mr.
Isaacs
has
advanced
us
fifty
pounds
to
pay
off
our
debts
and
to

get
a
proper
outfit
for
James
.
You
must
not
forget
that
,
Sibyl

Fifty
*NL*
pounds
is
a
very
large
sum
.
Mr.
Isaacs
has
been
most
considerate

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
a
gentleman
,
Mother

and
I
hate
the
way
he
talks
to
me

''
*NL*
said
the
girl
,
rising
to
her
feet
and
going
over
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
we
could
manage
without
him

''
answered
the
elder
*NL*
woman
querulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sibyl
Vane
tossed
her
head
and
laughed
.
``
We
do
n't
want
him
any
more
,
*NL*
Mother
.
Prince
Charming
rules
life
for
us
now
.
''
Then
she
paused
.
A
*NL*
rose
shook
in
her
blood
and
shadowed
her
cheeks
.
Quick
breath
parted
*NL*
the
petals
of
her
lips
.
They
trembled
.
Some
southern
wind
of
passion
*NL*
swept
over
her
and
stirred
the
dainty
folds
of
her
dress
.
``
I
love
*NL*
him
,
''
she
said
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foolish
child
!
foolish
child
!
''
was
the
parrot-phrase
flung
in
answer
.
*NL*
The
waving
of
crooked
,
false-jewelled
fingers
gave
grotesqueness
to
the
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
laughed
again
.
The
joy
of
a
caged
bird
was
in
her
voice
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
caught
the
melody
and
echoed
it
in
radiance
,
then
closed
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
as
though
to
hide
their
secret
.
When
they
opened
,
the
mist
of
*NL*
a
dream
had
passed
across
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thin-lipped
wisdom
spoke
at
her
from
the
worn
chair
,
hinted
at
*NL*
prudence
,
quoted
from
that
book
of
cowardice
whose
author
apes
the
name
*NL*
of
common
sense
.
She
did
not
listen
.
She
was
free
in
her
prison
of
*NL*
passion
.
Her
prince
,
Prince
Charming
,
was
with
her
.
She
had
called
on
*NL*
memory
to
remake
him
.
She
had
sent
her
soul
to
search
for
him
,
and
it
*NL*
had
brought
him
back
.
His
kiss
burned
again
upon
her
mouth
.
Her
*NL*
eyelids
were
warm
with
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
wisdom
altered
its
method
and
spoke
of
espial
and
discovery
.
This
*NL*
young
man
might
be
rich
.
If
so
,
marriage
should
be
thought
of
.
*NL*
Against
the
shell
of
her
ear
broke
the
waves
of
worldly
cunning
.
The
*NL*
arrows
of
craft
shot
by
her
.
She
saw
the
thin
lips
moving
,
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
felt
the
need
to
speak
.
The
wordy
silence
troubled
her
.
*NL*
``
Mother
,
Mother
,
''
she
cried
,
``
why
does
he
love
me
so
much
?
I
know
why
*NL*
I
love
him
.
I
love
him
because
he
is
like
what
love
himself
should
be
.
*NL*
But
what
does
he
see
in
me
?
I
am
not
worthy
of
him
.
And
yet
--
why
,
I
*NL*
can
not
tell
--
though
I
feel
so
much
beneath
him
,
I
do
n't
feel
humble
.
I
*NL*
feel
proud
,
terribly
proud
.
Mother
,
did
you
love
my
father
as
I
love
*NL*
Prince
Charming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
woman
grew
pale
beneath
the
coarse
powder
that
daubed
her
*NL*
cheeks
,
and
her
dry
lips
twitched
with
a
spasm
of
pain
.
Sybil
rushed
*NL*
to
her
,
flung
her
arms
round
her
neck
,
and
kissed
her
.
``
Forgive
me
,
*NL*
Mother
.
I
know
it
pains
you
to
talk
about
our
father
.
But
it
only
*NL*
pains
you
because
you
loved
him
so
much
.
Do
n't
look
so
sad
.
I
am
as
*NL*
happy
to-day
as
you
were
twenty
years
ago
.
Ah
!
let
me
be
happy
for
*NL*
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
you
are
far
too
young
to
think
of
falling
in
love
.
Besides
,
*NL*
what
do
you
know
of
this
young
man
?
You
do
n't
even
know
his
name
.
The
*NL*
whole
thing
is
most
inconvenient
,
and
really
,
when
James
is
going
away
*NL*
to
Australia
,
and
I
have
so
much
to
think
of
,
I
must
say
that
you
*NL*
should
have
shown
more
consideration
.
However
,
as
I
said
before
,
if
he
*NL*
is
rich
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Mother
,
Mother
,
let
me
be
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Vane
glanced
at
her
,
and
with
one
of
those
false
theatrical
*NL*
gestures
that
so
often
become
a
mode
of
second
nature
to
a
*NL*
stage-player
,
clasped
her
in
her
arms
.
At
this
moment
,
the
door
opened
*NL*
and
a
young
lad
with
rough
brown
hair
came
into
the
room
.
He
was
*NL*
thick-set
of
figure
,
and
his
hands
and
feet
were
large
and
somewhat
*NL*
clumsy
in
movement
.
He
was
not
so
finely
bred
as
his
sister
.
One
*NL*
would
hardly
have
guessed
the
close
relationship
that
existed
between
*NL*
them
.
Mrs.
Vane
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
and
intensified
her
smile
.
She
*NL*
mentally
elevated
her
son
to
the
dignity
of
an
audience
.
She
felt
sure
*NL*
that
the
_
tableau
_
was
interesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
keep
some
of
your
kisses
for
me
,
Sibyl
,
I
think
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lad
with
a
good-natured
grumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
but
you
do
n't
like
being
kissed
,
Jim
,
''
she
cried
.
``
You
are
a
*NL*
dreadful
old
bear
.
''
And
she
ran
across
the
room
and
hugged
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
James
Vane
looked
into
his
sister
's
face
with
tenderness
.
``
I
want
you
*NL*
to
come
out
with
me
for
a
walk
,
Sibyl
.
I
do
n't
suppose
I
shall
ever
*NL*
see
this
horrid
London
again
.
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
,
do
n't
say
such
dreadful
things
,
''
murmured
Mrs.
Vane
,
taking
up
*NL*
a
tawdry
theatrical
dress
,
with
a
sigh
,
and
beginning
to
patch
it
.
She
*NL*
felt
a
little
disappointed
that
he
had
not
joined
the
group
.
It
would
*NL*
have
increased
the
theatrical
picturesqueness
of
the
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
,
Mother
?
I
mean
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
pain
me
,
my
son
.
I
trust
you
will
return
from
Australia
in
a
*NL*
position
of
affluence
.
I
believe
there
is
no
society
of
any
kind
in
*NL*
the
Colonies
--
nothing
that
I
would
call
society
--
so
when
you
have
made
*NL*
your
fortune
,
you
must
come
back
and
assert
yourself
in
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Society
!
''
muttered
the
lad
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
know
anything
about
*NL*
that
.
I
should
like
to
make
some
money
to
take
you
and
Sibyl
off
the
*NL*
stage
.
I
hate
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Jim
!
''
said
Sibyl
,
laughing
,
``
how
unkind
of
you
!
But
are
you
*NL*
really
going
for
a
walk
with
me
?
That
will
be
nice
!
I
was
afraid
you
*NL*
were
going
to
say
good-bye
to
some
of
your
friends
--
to
Tom
Hardy
,
who
*NL*
gave
you
that
hideous
pipe
,
or
Ned
Langton
,
who
makes
fun
of
you
for
*NL*
smoking
it
.
It
is
very
sweet
of
you
to
let
me
have
your
last
*NL*
afternoon
.
Where
shall
we
go
?
Let
us
go
to
the
park
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
too
shabby
,
''
he
answered
,
frowning
.
``
Only
swell
people
go
to
the
*NL*
park
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
Jim
,
''
she
whispered
,
stroking
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
for
a
moment
.
``
Very
well
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
but
do
n't
be
*NL*
too
long
dressing
.
''
She
danced
out
of
the
door
.
One
could
hear
her
*NL*
singing
as
she
ran
upstairs
.
Her
little
feet
pattered
overhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
up
and
down
the
room
two
or
three
times
.
Then
he
turned
to
*NL*
the
still
figure
in
the
chair
.
``
Mother
,
are
my
things
ready
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
ready
,
James
,
''
she
answered
,
keeping
her
eyes
on
her
work
.
For
*NL*
some
months
past
she
had
felt
ill
at
ease
when
she
was
alone
with
this
*NL*
rough
stern
son
of
hers
.
Her
shallow
secret
nature
was
troubled
when
*NL*
their
eyes
met
.
She
used
to
wonder
if
he
suspected
anything
.
The
*NL*
silence
,
for
he
made
no
other
observation
,
became
intolerable
to
her
.
*NL*
She
began
to
complain
.
Women
defend
themselves
by
attacking
,
just
as
*NL*
they
attack
by
sudden
and
strange
surrenders
.
``
I
hope
you
will
be
*NL*
contented
,
James
,
with
your
sea-faring
life
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
must
*NL*
remember
that
it
is
your
own
choice
.
You
might
have
entered
a
*NL*
solicitor
's
office
.
Solicitors
are
a
very
respectable
class
,
and
in
*NL*
the
country
often
dine
with
the
best
families
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
offices
,
and
I
hate
clerks
,
''
he
replied
.
``
But
you
are
quite
*NL*
right
.
I
have
chosen
my
own
life

All
I
say
is
,
watch
over
Sibyl
.
*NL*
Do
n't
let
her
come
to
any
harm

Mother
,
you
must
watch
over
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
James
,
you
really
talk
very
strangely
.
Of
course
I
watch
over
Sibyl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
a
gentleman
comes
every
night
to
the
theatre
and
goes
behind
to
*NL*
talk
to
her
.
Is
that
right
?
What
about
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
speaking
about
things
you
do
n't
understand
,
James
.
In
the
*NL*
profession
we
are
accustomed
to
receive
a
great
deal
of
most
gratifying
*NL*
attention
.
I
myself
used
to
receive
many
bouquets
at
one
time
.
That
*NL*
was
when
acting
was
really
understood
.
As
for
Sibyl
,
I
do
not
know
at
*NL*
present
whether
her
attachment
is
serious
or
not
.
But
there
is
no
*NL*
doubt
that
the
young
man
in
question
is
a
perfect
gentleman
.
He
is
*NL*
always
most
polite
to
me
.
Besides
,
he
has
the
appearance
of
being
*NL*
rich

and
the
flowers
he
sends
are
lovely

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
his
name

though

said
the
lad
harshly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
his
mother
with
a
placid
expression
in
her
face
.
``
He
*NL*
has
not
yet
revealed
his
real
name
.
I
think
it
is
quite
romantic
of
*NL*
him

He
is
probably
a
member
of
the
aristocracy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
James
Vane
bit
his
lip
.
``
Watch
over
Sibyl
,
Mother
,
''
he
cried
,
``
watch
*NL*
over
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
,
you
distress
me
very
much

Sibyl

always
under
my
special

care

Of
course
,
if
this
gentleman
is
wealthy
,
there
is
no
reason
why
*NL*
she
should
not
contract
an
alliance
with
him

I
trust
he
is
one
of
the
*NL*
aristocracy
.
He
has
all
the
appearance
of
it
,
I
must
say
.
It
might
be
*NL*
a
most
brilliant
marriage
for
Sibyl
.
They
would
make
a
charming
*NL*
couple

His
good
looks
are
really
quite
remarkable

everybody
notices
*NL*
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
muttered
something
to
himself
and
drummed
on
the
window-pane
*NL*
with
his
coarse
fingers
.
He
had
just
turned
round
to
say
something
*NL*
when
the
door
opened
and
Sibyl
ran
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
serious
you
both
are
!
''
she
cried
.
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
suppose
one
must
be
serious
sometimes
.
*NL*
Good-bye
,
Mother
;
I
will
have
my
dinner
at
five
o'clock
.
Everything
is
*NL*
packed
,
except
my
shirts
,
so
you
need
not
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
my
son
,
''
she
answered
with
a
bow
of
strained
stateliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
extremely
annoyed
at
the
tone
he
had
adopted
with
her
,
and
*NL*
there
was
something
in
his
look
that
had
made
her
feel
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kiss
me
,
Mother
,
''
said
the
girl
.
Her
flowerlike
lips
touched
the
*NL*
withered
cheek
and
warmed
its
frost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
!
my
child
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Vane
,
looking
up
to
the
ceiling
in
*NL*
search
of
an
imaginary
gallery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Sibyl
,
''
said
her
brother
impatiently
.
He
hated
his
mother
's
*NL*
affectations
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
into
the
flickering
,
wind-blown
sunlight
and
strolled
*NL*
down
the
dreary
Euston
Road
.
The
passersby
glanced
in
wonder
at
the
*NL*
sullen
heavy
youth
who
,
in
coarse
,
ill-fitting
clothes
,
was
in
the
*NL*
company
of
such
a
graceful
,
refined-looking
girl
.
He
was
like
a
common
*NL*
gardener
walking
with
a
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
frowned
from
time
to
time
when
he
caught
the
inquisitive
glance
of
*NL*
some
stranger
.
He
had
that
dislike
of
being
stared
at
,
which
comes
on
*NL*
geniuses
late
in
life
and
never
leaves
the
commonplace
.
Sibyl
,
*NL*
however
,
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
effect
she
was
producing
.
Her
*NL*
love
was
trembling
in
laughter
on
her
lips
.
She
was
thinking
of
Prince
*NL*
Charming
,
and
,
that
she
might
think
of
him
all
the
more
,
she
did
not
*NL*
talk
of
him
,
but
prattled
on
about
the
ship
in
which
Jim
was
going
to
*NL*
sail
,
about
the
gold
he
was
certain
to
find
,
about
the
wonderful
*NL*
heiress
whose
life
he
was
to
save
from
the
wicked
,
red-shirted
*NL*
bushrangers
.
For
he
was
not
to
remain
a
sailor
,
or
a
supercargo
,
or
*NL*
whatever
he
was
going
to
be
.
Oh
,
no
!
A
sailor
's
existence
was
*NL*
dreadful
.
Fancy
being
cooped
up
in
a
horrid
ship
,
with
the
hoarse
,
*NL*
hump-backed
waves
trying
to
get
in
,
and
a
black
wind
blowing
the
masts
*NL*
down
and
tearing
the
sails
into
long
screaming
ribands
!
He
was
to
*NL*
leave
the
vessel
at
Melbourne
,
bid
a
polite
good-bye
to
the
captain
,
*NL*
and
go
off
at
once
to
the
gold-fields
.
Before
a
week
was
over
he
was
to
*NL*
come
across
a
large
nugget
of
pure
gold
,
the
largest
nugget
that
had
*NL*
ever
been
discovered
,
and
bring
it
down
to
the
coast
in
a
waggon
*NL*
guarded
by
six
mounted
policemen
.
The
bushrangers
were
to
attack
them
*NL*
three
times
,
and
be
defeated
with
immense
slaughter
.
Or
,
no
.
He
was
*NL*
not
to
go
to
the
gold-fields
at
all
.
They
were
horrid
places
,
where
*NL*
men
got
intoxicated
,
and
shot
each
other
in
bar-rooms
,
and
used
bad
*NL*
language
.
He
was
to
be
a
nice
sheep-farmer
,
and
one
evening
,
as
he
was
*NL*
riding
home
,
he
was
to
see
the
beautiful
heiress
being
carried
off
by
a
*NL*
robber
on
a
black
horse
,
and
give
chase
,
and
rescue
her
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
she
would
fall
in
love
with
him
,
and
he
with
her
,
and
they
would
get
*NL*
married
,
and
come
home
,
and
live
in
an
immense
house
in
London
.
Yes
,
*NL*
there
were
delightful
things
in
store
for
him
.
But
he
must
be
very
*NL*
good
,
and
not
lose
his
temper
,
or
spend
his
money
foolishly
.
She
was
*NL*
only
a
year
older
than
he
was
,
but
she
knew
so
much
more
of
life
.
He
*NL*
must
be
sure
,
also
,
to
write
to
her
by
every
mail
,
and
to
say
his
*NL*
prayers
each
night
before
he
went
to
sleep
.
God
was
very
good
,
and
*NL*
would
watch
over
him
.
She
would
pray
for
him
,
too
,
and
in
a
few
years
*NL*
he
would
come
back
quite
rich
and
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
listened
sulkily
to
her
and
made
no
answer
.
He
was
heart-sick
*NL*
at
leaving
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
was
not
this
alone
that
made
him
gloomy
and
morose
.
*NL*
Inexperienced
though
he
was
,
he
had
still
a
strong
sense
of
the
danger
*NL*
of
Sibyl
's
position
.
This
young
dandy
who
was
making
love
to
her
could
*NL*
mean
her
no
good
.
He
was
a
gentleman
,
and
he
hated
him
for
that
,
hated
*NL*
him
through
some
curious
race-instinct
for
which
he
could
not
account
,
*NL*
and
which
for
that
reason
was
all
the
more
dominant
within
him
.
He
was
*NL*
conscious
also
of
the
shallowness
and
vanity
of
his
mother
's
nature
,
*NL*
and
in
that
saw
infinite
peril
for
Sibyl
and
Sibyl
's
happiness
.
*NL*
Children
begin
by
loving
their
parents
;
as
they
grow
older
they
judge
*NL*
them
;
sometimes
they
forgive
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
!
He
had
something
on
his
mind
to
ask
of
her
,
something
that
*NL*
he
had
brooded
on
for
many
months
of
silence
.
A
chance
phrase
that
he
*NL*
had
heard
at
the
theatre
,
a
whispered
sneer
that
had
reached
his
ears
*NL*
one
night
as
he
waited
at
the
stage-door
,
had
set
loose
a
train
of
*NL*
horrible
thoughts
.
He
remembered
it
as
if
it
had
been
the
lash
of
a
*NL*
hunting-crop
across
his
face
.
His
brows
knit
together
into
a
wedge-like
*NL*
furrow
,
and
with
a
twitch
of
pain
he
bit
his
underlip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
listening
to
a
word
I
am
saying
,
Jim
,
''
cried
Sibyl
,
``
and
I
*NL*
am
making
the
most
delightful
plans
for
your
future
.
Do
say
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
me
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
that
you
will
be
a
good
boy
and
not
forget
us
,
''
she
answered
,
*NL*
smiling
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
You
are
more
likely
to
forget
me
than
I
am
*NL*
to
forget
you
,
Sibyl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
.
``
What
do
you
mean
,
Jim
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
new
friend
,
I
hear
.
Who
is
he
?
Why
have
you
not
told
me
*NL*
about
him
?
He
means
you
no
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
Jim
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
You
must
not
say
anything
against
him
.
I
*NL*
love
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
do
n't
even
know
his
name
,
''
answered
the
lad
.
``
Who
is
he
?
I
*NL*
have
a
right
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
called
Prince
Charming
.
Do
n't
you
like
the
name
.
Oh
!
you
silly
*NL*
boy
!
you
should
never
forget
it
.
If
you
only
saw
him
,
you
would
think
*NL*
him
the
most
wonderful
person
in
the
world
.
Some
day
you
will
meet
*NL*
him
--
when
you
come
back
from
Australia
.
You
will
like
him
so
much
.
*NL*
Everybody
likes
him
,
and
I
...
love
him
.
I
wish
you
could
come
to
the
*NL*
theatre
to-night
.
He
is
going
to
be
there
,
and
I
am
to
play
Juliet
.
*NL*
Oh
!
how
I
shall
play
it
!
Fancy
,
Jim
,
to
be
in
love
and
play
Juliet
!
*NL*
To
have
him
sitting
there
!
To
play
for
his
delight
!
I
am
afraid
I
may
*NL*
frighten
the
company
,
frighten
or
enthrall
them
.
To
be
in
love
is
to
*NL*
surpass
one
's
self
.
Poor
dreadful
Mr.
Isaacs
will
be
shouting
`
genius
'
*NL*
to
his
loafers
at
the
bar
.
He
has
preached
me
as
a
dogma
;
to-night
he
*NL*
will
announce
me
as
a
revelation
.
I
feel
it
.
And
it
is
all
his
,
his
*NL*
only
,
Prince
Charming
,
my
wonderful
lover
,
my
god
of
graces
.
But
I
am
*NL*
poor
beside
him
.
Poor
?
What
does
that
matter
?
When
poverty
creeps
in
*NL*
at
the
door
,
love
flies
in
through
the
window
.
Our
proverbs
want
*NL*
rewriting
.
They
were
made
in
winter
,
and
it
is
summer
now
;
spring-time
*NL*
for
me
,
I
think
,
a
very
dance
of
blossoms
in
blue
skies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
gentleman
,
''
said
the
lad
sullenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
prince
!
''
she
cried
musically
.
``
What
more
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wants
to
enslave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shudder
at
the
thought
of
being
free

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
beware
of
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
him
is
to
worship
him

to
know
him
is
to
trust
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sibyl
,
you
are
mad
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
and
took
his
arm
.
``
You
dear
old
Jim
,
you
talk
as
if
you
*NL*
were
a
hundred
.
Some
day
you
will
be
in
love
yourself
.
Then
you
will
*NL*
know
what
it
is
.
Do
n't
look
so
sulky
.
Surely
you
should
be
glad
to
*NL*
think
that
,
though
you
are
going
away
,
you
leave
me
happier
than
I
have
*NL*
ever
been
before
.
Life
has
been
hard
for
us
both
,
terribly
hard
and
*NL*
difficult
.
But
it
will
be
different
now
.
You
are
going
to
a
new
*NL*
world
,
and
I
have
found
one
.
Here
are
two
chairs
;
let
us
sit
down
and
*NL*
see
the
smart
people
go
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
took
their
seats
amidst
a
crowd
of
watchers
.
The
tulip-beds
*NL*
across
the
road
flamed
like
throbbing
rings
of
fire
.
A
white
*NL*
dust
--
tremulous
cloud
of
orris-root
it
seemed
--
hung
in
the
panting
air
.
*NL*
The
brightly
coloured
parasols
danced
and
dipped
like
monstrous
*NL*
butterflies
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
her
brother
talk
of
himself
,
his
hopes
,
his
prospects
.
He
*NL*
spoke
slowly
and
with
effort
.
They
passed
words
to
each
other
as
*NL*
players
at
a
game
pass
counters
.
Sibyl
felt
oppressed
.
She
could
not
*NL*
communicate
her
joy
.
A
faint
smile
curving
that
sullen
mouth
was
all
*NL*
the
echo
she
could
win
.
After
some
time
she
became
silent
.
Suddenly
*NL*
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
golden
hair
and
laughing
lips
,
and
in
an
open
*NL*
carriage
with
two
ladies
Dorian
Gray
drove
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
to
her
feet
.
``
There
he
is
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
said
Jim
Vane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
Charming
,
''
she
answered
,
looking
after
the
victoria
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
and
seized
her
roughly
by
the
arm
.
``
Show
him
to
me
.
*NL*
Which
is
he
?
Point
him
out
.
I
must
see
him
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
but
at
*NL*
that
moment
the
Duke
of
Berwick
's
four-in-hand
came
between
,
and
when
*NL*
it
had
left
the
space
clear
,
the
carriage
had
swept
out
of
the
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
gone
,
''
murmured
Sibyl
sadly
.
``
I
wish
you
had
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
,
for
as
sure
as
there
is
a
God
in
heaven
,
if
he
ever
does
*NL*
you
any
wrong
,
I
shall
kill
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
in
horror
.
He
repeated
his
words
.
They
cut
the
air
*NL*
like
a
dagger
.
The
people
round
began
to
gape
.
A
lady
standing
close
*NL*
to
her
tittered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
away
,
Jim
;
come
away
,
''
she
whispered
.
He
followed
her
doggedly
*NL*
as
she
passed
through
the
crowd
.
He
felt
glad
at
what
he
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
Achilles
Statue
,
she
turned
round
.
There
was
*NL*
pity
in
her
eyes
that
became
laughter
on
her
lips
.
She
shook
her
head
*NL*
at
him
.
``
You
are
foolish
,
Jim
,
utterly
foolish
;
a
bad-tempered
boy
,
*NL*
that
is
all
.
How
can
you
say
such
horrible
things
?
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
you
are
talking
about
.
You
are
simply
jealous
and
unkind
.
Ah
!
I
*NL*
wish
you
would
fall
in
love
.
Love
makes
people
good
,
and
what
you
said
*NL*
was
wicked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sixteen
,
''
he
answered
,
``
and
I
know
what
I
am
about
.
Mother
is
no
*NL*
help
to
you
.
She
does
n't
understand
how
to
look
after
you
.
I
wish
now
*NL*
that
I
was
not
going
to
Australia
at
all
.
I
have
a
great
mind
to
chuck
*NL*
the
whole
thing
up
.
I
would
,
if
my
articles
had
n't
been
signed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
be
so
serious
,
Jim
.
You
are
like
one
of
the
heroes
of
those
*NL*
silly
melodramas
Mother
used
to
be
so
fond
of
acting
in
.
I
am
not
*NL*
going
to
quarrel
with
you
.
I
have
seen
him
,
and
oh
!
to
see
him
is
*NL*
perfect
happiness
.
We
wo
n't
quarrel
.
I
know
you
would
never
harm
any
*NL*
one
I
love
,
would
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
long
as
you
love
him
,
I
suppose
,
''
was
the
sullen
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
love
him
for
ever
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
ever
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shrank
from
him
.
Then
she
laughed
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
.
He
*NL*
was
merely
a
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Marble
Arch
they
hailed
an
omnibus
,
which
left
them
close
to
*NL*
their
shabby
home
in
the
Euston
Road
.
It
was
after
five
o'clock
,
and
*NL*
Sibyl
had
to
lie
down
for
a
couple
of
hours
before
acting
.
Jim
*NL*
insisted
that
she
should
do
so
.
He
said
that
he
would
sooner
part
with
*NL*
her
when
their
mother
was
not
present
.
She
would
be
sure
to
make
a
*NL*
scene
,
and
he
detested
scenes
of
every
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Sybil
's
own
room
they
parted
.
There
was
jealousy
in
the
lad
's
*NL*
heart
,
and
a
fierce
murderous
hatred
of
the
stranger
who
,
as
it
seemed
*NL*
to
him
,
had
come
between
them
.
Yet
,
when
her
arms
were
flung
round
his
*NL*
neck
,
and
her
fingers
strayed
through
his
hair
,
he
softened
and
kissed
*NL*
her
with
real
affection
.
There
were
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
went
*NL*
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
was
waiting
for
him
below
.
She
grumbled
at
his
*NL*
unpunctuality
,
as
he
entered
.
He
made
no
answer
,
but
sat
down
to
his
*NL*
meagre
meal
.
The
flies
buzzed
round
the
table
and
crawled
over
the
*NL*
stained
cloth
.
Through
the
rumble
of
omnibuses
,
and
the
clatter
of
*NL*
street-cabs
,
he
could
hear
the
droning
voice
devouring
each
minute
that
*NL*
was
left
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
time
,
he
thrust
away
his
plate
and
put
his
head
in
his
*NL*
hands
.
He
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
know
.
It
should
have
been
told
*NL*
to
him
before
,
if
it
was
as
he
suspected
.
Leaden
with
fear
,
his
mother
*NL*
watched
him
.
Words
dropped
mechanically
from
her
lips
.
A
tattered
*NL*
lace
handkerchief
twitched
in
her
fingers
.
When
the
clock
struck
six
,
*NL*
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
.
Then
he
turned
back
and
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
Their
eyes
met
.
In
hers
he
saw
a
wild
appeal
for
mercy
.
It
enraged
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
I
have
something
to
ask
you
,
''
he
said
.
Her
eyes
wandered
*NL*
vaguely
about
the
room
.
She
made
no
answer
.
``
Tell
me
the
truth
.
I
*NL*
have
a
right
to
know
.
Were
you
married
to
my
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
It
was
a
sigh
of
relief
.
The
terrible
moment
,
*NL*
the
moment
that
night
and
day
,
for
weeks
and
months
,
she
had
dreaded
,
*NL*
had
come
at
last
,
and
yet
she
felt
no
terror
.
Indeed
,
in
some
measure
*NL*
it
was
a
disappointment
to
her
.
The
vulgar
directness
of
the
question
*NL*
called
for
a
direct
answer
.
The
situation
had
not
been
gradually
led
*NL*
up
to
.
It
was
crude
.
It
reminded
her
of
a
bad
rehearsal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
,
wondering
at
the
harsh
simplicity
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
was
a
scoundrel
then
!
''
cried
the
lad
,
clenching
his
fists
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
``
I
knew
he
was
not
free
.
We
loved
each
other
very
*NL*
much
.
If
he
had
lived
,
he
would
have
made
provision
for
us
.
Do
n't
*NL*
speak
against
him
,
my
son
.
He
was
your
father
,
and
a
gentleman
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
he
was
highly
connected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
oath
broke
from
his
lips
.
``
I
do
n't
care
for
myself
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
but
do
n't
let
Sibyl
...
It
is
a
gentleman
,
is
n't
it
,
who
is
in
love
*NL*
with
her
,
or
says
he
is
?
Highly
connected
,
too
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
a
hideous
sense
of
humiliation
came
over
the
woman
.
Her
*NL*
head
drooped
.
She
wiped
her
eyes
with
shaking
hands
.
``
Sibyl
has
a
*NL*
mother
,
''
she
murmured
;
``
I
had
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
was
touched
.
He
went
towards
her
,
and
stooping
down
,
he
kissed
*NL*
her
.
``
I
am
sorry
if
I
have
pained
you
by
asking
about
my
father
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
but
I
could
not
help
it
.
I
must
go
now
.
Good-bye
.
Do
n't
forget
*NL*
that
you
will
have
only
one
child
now
to
look
after
,
and
believe
me
*NL*
that
if
this
man
wrongs
my
sister
,
I
will
find
out
who
he
is
,
track
him
*NL*
down
,
and
kill
him
like
a
dog
.
I
swear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
exaggerated
folly
of
the
threat
,
the
passionate
gesture
that
*NL*
accompanied
it
,
the
mad
melodramatic
words
,
made
life
seem
more
vivid
*NL*
to
her
.
She
was
familiar
with
the
atmosphere
.
She
breathed
more
*NL*
freely
,
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
she
really
admired
her
*NL*
son
.
She
would
have
liked
to
have
continued
the
scene
on
the
same
*NL*
emotional
scale
,
but
he
cut
her
short
.
Trunks
had
to
be
carried
down
*NL*
and
mufflers
looked
for
.
The
lodging-house
drudge
bustled
in
and
out
.
*NL*
There
was
the
bargaining
with
the
cabman
.
The
moment
was
lost
in
*NL*
vulgar
details
.
It
was
with
a
renewed
feeling
of
disappointment
that
*NL*
she
waved
the
tattered
lace
handkerchief
from
the
window
,
as
her
son
*NL*
drove
away
.
She
was
conscious
that
a
great
opportunity
had
been
*NL*
wasted
.
She
consoled
herself
by
telling
Sibyl
how
desolate
she
felt
*NL*
her
life
would
be
,
now
that
she
had
only
one
child
to
look
after
.
She
*NL*
remembered
the
phrase
.
It
had
pleased
her
.
Of
the
threat
she
said
*NL*
nothing
.
It
was
vividly
and
dramatically
expressed
.
She
felt
that
*NL*
they
would
all
laugh
at
it
some
day
.

CHAPTER
6
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
have
heard
the
news
,
Basil
?
''
said
Lord
Henry
that
*NL*
evening
as
Hallward
was
shown
into
a
little
private
room
at
the
Bristol
*NL*
where
dinner
had
been
laid
for
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Harry
,
''
answered
the
artist
,
giving
his
hat
and
coat
to
the
bowing
*NL*
waiter
.
``
What
is
it
?
Nothing
about
politics
,
I
hope
!
They
do
n't
*NL*
interest
me
.
There
is
hardly
a
single
person
in
the
House
of
Commons
*NL*
worth
painting
,
though
many
of
them
would
be
the
better
for
a
little
*NL*
whitewashing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
Gray
is
engaged
to
be
married
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
watching
him
*NL*
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
started
and
then
frowned
.
``
Dorian
engaged
to
be
married
!
''
he
*NL*
cried
.
``
Impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
perfectly
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
some
little
actress
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
believe
it
.
Dorian
is
far
too
sensible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
is
far
too
wise
not
to
do
foolish
things
now
and
then
,
my
dear
*NL*
Basil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marriage
is
hardly
a
thing
that
one
can
do
now
and
then
,
Harry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
in
America
,
''
rejoined
Lord
Henry
languidly
.
``
But
I
did
n't
say
*NL*
he
was
married
.
I
said
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
.
There
is
a
great
*NL*
difference
.
I
have
a
distinct
remembrance
of
being
married
,
but
I
have
*NL*
no
recollection
at
all
of
being
engaged
.
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
I
*NL*
never
was
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
think
of
Dorian
's
birth
,
and
position
,
and
wealth
.
It
would
be
*NL*
absurd
for
him
to
marry
so
much
beneath
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
want
to
make
him
marry
this
girl
,
tell
him
that
,
Basil
.
He
is
*NL*
sure
to
do
it
,
then
.
Whenever
a
man
does
a
thoroughly
stupid
thing
,
it
*NL*
is
always
from
the
noblest
motives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
the
girl
is
good
,
Harry
.
I
do
n't
want
to
see
Dorian
tied
to
*NL*
some
vile
creature
,
who
might
degrade
his
nature
and
ruin
his
*NL*
intellect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
is
better
than
good
--
she
is
beautiful
,
''
murmured
Lord
Henry
,
*NL*
sipping
a
glass
of
vermouth
and
orange-bitters
.
``
Dorian
says
she
is
*NL*
beautiful
,
and
he
is
not
often
wrong
about
things
of
that
kind
.
Your
*NL*
portrait
of
him
has
quickened
his
appreciation
of
the
personal
*NL*
appearance
of
other
people
.
It
has
had
that
excellent
effect
,
amongst
*NL*
others
.
We
are
to
see
her
to-night
,
if
that
boy
does
n't
forget
his
*NL*
appointment

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
serious

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
serious
,
Basil
.
I
should
be
miserable
if
I
thought
I
should
*NL*
ever
be
more
serious
than
I
am
at
the
present
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
approve
of
it
,
Harry
?
''
asked
the
painter
,
walking
up
and
*NL*
down
the
room
and
biting
his
lip
.
``
You
ca
n't
approve
of
it
,
possibly
.
*NL*
It
is
some
silly
infatuation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
approve
,
or
disapprove
,
of
anything
now
.
It
is
an
absurd
*NL*
attitude
to
take
towards
life
.
We
are
not
sent
into
the
world
to
air
*NL*
our
moral
prejudices
.
I
never
take
any
notice
of
what
common
people
*NL*
say
,
and
I
never
interfere
with
what
charming
people
do
.
If
a
*NL*
personality
fascinates
me
,
whatever
mode
of
expression
that
personality
*NL*
selects
is
absolutely
delightful
to
me
.
Dorian
Gray
falls
in
love
with
*NL*
a
beautiful
girl
who
acts
Juliet
,
and
proposes
to
marry
her
.
Why
not
?
*NL*
If
he
wedded
Messalina
,
he
would
be
none
the
less
interesting
.
You
*NL*
know
I
am
not
a
champion
of
marriage
.
The
real
drawback
to
marriage
is
*NL*
that
it
makes
one
unselfish
.
And
unselfish
people
are
colourless
.
*NL*
They
lack
individuality
.
Still
,
there
are
certain
temperaments
that
*NL*
marriage
makes
more
complex
.
They
retain
their
egotism
,
and
add
to
it
*NL*
many
other
egos
.
They
are
forced
to
have
more
than
one
life
.
They
*NL*
become
more
highly
organized
,
and
to
be
highly
organized
is
,
I
should
*NL*
fancy
,
the
object
of
man
's
existence
.
Besides
,
every
experience
is
of
*NL*
value
,
and
whatever
one
may
say
against
marriage
,
it
is
certainly
an
*NL*
experience
.
I
hope
that
Dorian
Gray
will
make
this
girl
his
wife
,
*NL*
passionately
adore
her
for
six
months
,
and
then
suddenly
become
*NL*
fascinated
by
some
one
else
.
He
would
be
a
wonderful
study
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
a
single
word
of
all
that

Harry
;
you
know
you
do
n't
.
*NL*
If
Dorian
Gray
's
life
were
spoiled
,
no
one
would
be
sorrier
than
*NL*
yourself
.
You
are
much
better
than
you
pretend
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
laughed
.
``
The
reason
we
all
like
to
think
so
well
of
others
*NL*
is
that
we
are
all
afraid
for
ourselves
.
The
basis
of
optimism
is
*NL*
sheer
terror
.
We
think
that
we
are
generous
because
we
credit
our
*NL*
neighbour
with
the
possession
of
those
virtues
that
are
likely
to
be
a
*NL*
benefit
to
us
.
We
praise
the
banker
that
we
may
overdraw
our
account
,
*NL*
and
find
good
qualities
in
the
highwayman
in
the
hope
that
he
may
spare
*NL*
our
pockets
.
I
mean
everything
that
I
have
said
.
I
have
the
greatest
*NL*
contempt
for
optimism
.
As
for
a
spoiled
life
,
no
life
is
spoiled
but
*NL*
one
whose
growth
is
arrested
.
If
you
want
to
mar
a
nature
,
you
have
*NL*
merely
to
reform
it
.
As
for
marriage
,
of
course
that
would
be
silly
,
*NL*
but
there
are
other
and
more
interesting
bonds
between
men
and
women
.
*NL*
I
will
certainly
encourage
them
.
They
have
the
charm
of
being
*NL*
fashionable
.
But
here
is
Dorian
himself
.
He
will
tell
you
more
than
I
*NL*
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Harry
,
my
dear
Basil
,
you
must
both
congratulate
me
!

said
the
*NL*
lad
,
throwing
off
his
evening
cape
with
its
satin-lined
wings
and
*NL*
shaking
each
of
his
friends
by
the
hand
in
turn
.
``
I
have
never
been
so
*NL*
happy

Of

it
is
sudden

all
really
delightful

And
*NL*
yet
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
one
thing
I
have
been
looking
for
all
my
*NL*
life

He
was
flushed
with
excitement
and
pleasure
,
and
looked
*NL*
extraordinarily
handsome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
always
be
very
happy

said
Hallward
,
``
but
I
*NL*
do

quite
forgive
you

not
having

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do

being
late

broke
in
Lord
*NL*
Henry
,
putting
his
hand
on
the
lad
's
shoulder
and
smiling
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
``
Come

let
us
sit
down

try

you

how
it
all
came
about

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
really
not
much
to
tell
,
''
cried
Dorian
as
they
took
their
*NL*
seats
at
the
small
round
table
.
``
What
happened
was
simply
this
.
After
*NL*
I
left
you
yesterday
evening
,
Harry
,
I
dressed
,
had
some
dinner
at
that
*NL*
little
Italian
restaurant
in
Rupert
Street
you
introduced
me
to
,
and
*NL*
went
down
at
eight
o'clock
to
the
theatre
.
Sibyl
was
playing
Rosalind
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
the
scenery
was
dreadful
and
the
Orlando
absurd
.
But
Sibyl
!
*NL*
You
should
have
seen
her
!
When
she
came
on
in
her
boy
's
clothes
,
she
*NL*
was
perfectly
wonderful
.
She
wore
a
moss-coloured
velvet
jerkin
with
*NL*
cinnamon
sleeves
,
slim
,
brown
,
cross-gartered
hose
,
a
dainty
little
*NL*
green
cap
with
a
hawk
's
feather
caught
in
a
jewel
,
and
a
hooded
cloak
*NL*
lined
with
dull
red
.
She
had
never
seemed
to
me
more
exquisite
.
She
*NL*
had
all
the
delicate
grace
of
that
Tanagra
figurine
that
you
have
in
*NL*
your
studio
,
Basil
.
Her
hair
clustered
round
her
face
like
dark
leaves
*NL*
round
a
pale
rose
.
As
for
her
acting
--
well
,
you
shall
see
her
*NL*
to-night
.
She
is
simply
a
born
artist
.
I
sat
in
the
dingy
box
*NL*
absolutely
enthralled
.
I
forgot
that
I
was
in
London
and
in
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
.
I
was
away
with
my
love
in
a
forest
that
no
man
*NL*
had
ever
seen
.
After
the
performance
was
over
,
I
went
behind
and
spoke
*NL*
to
her
.
As
we
were
sitting
together
,
suddenly
there
came
into
her
eyes
*NL*
a
look
that
I
had
never
seen
there
before
.
My
lips
moved
towards
hers
.
*NL*
We
kissed
each
other
.
I
ca
n't
describe
to
you
what
I
felt
at
that
*NL*
moment
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
life
had
been
narrowed
to
one
*NL*
perfect
point
of
rose-coloured
joy
.
She
trembled
all
over
and
shook
*NL*
like
a
white
narcissus
.
Then
she
flung
herself
on
her
knees
and
kissed
*NL*
my
hands
.
I
feel
that
I
should
not
tell
you
all
this
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
it
.
Of
course
,
our
engagement
is
a
dead
secret
.
She
has
not
even
told
*NL*
her
own
mother
.
I
do
n't
know
what
my
guardians
will
say
.
Lord
Radley
*NL*
is
sure
to
be
furious
.
I
do
n't
care
.
I
shall
be
of
age
in
less
than
a
*NL*
year
,
and
then
I
can
do
what
I
like
.
I
have
been
right
,
Basil
,
have
n't
*NL*
I
,
to
take
my
love
out
of
poetry
and
to
find
my
wife
in
Shakespeare
's
*NL*
plays
?
Lips
that
Shakespeare
taught
to
speak
have
whispered
their
*NL*
secret
in
my
ear
.
I
have
had
the
arms
of
Rosalind
around
me
,
and
*NL*
kissed
Juliet
on
the
mouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Dorian
,
I
suppose
you
were
right
,
''
said
Hallward
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
her
to-day
?

asked
Lord
Henry

*NL*
Dorian
Gray
shook
his
head
.
``
I
left

Arden

find

in

*NL*
Lord
Henry
sipped
his
champagne
in
a
meditative
manner
.
``
At
what
*NL*
particular
point
did
you
mention
the
word
marriage
,
Dorian
?
And
what
*NL*
did
she
say
in
answer

Perhaps
you
forgot
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Harry
,
I
did
not
treat
it
as
a
business
transaction
,
and
I
did
*NL*
not
make
any
formal
proposal
.
I
told
her
that
I
loved
her
,
and
she
*NL*
said
she
was
not
worthy
to
be
my
wife
.
Not
worthy
!
Why
,
the
whole
*NL*
world
is
nothing
to
me
compared
with
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
are
wonderfully
practical
,
''
murmured
Lord
Henry
,
``
much
more
*NL*
practical
than
we
are

In
situations
of

kind
we
often
forget
to

anything
about

they
always
remind

*NL*
Hallward
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm

``
Do
n't

Harry

You
have
annoyed

He
is
not
like
other
men

He
would
never
bring
misery
upon

any
one

His
nature
is
too
fine
for
that

*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
looked
across
the
table

``
Dorian

never
annoyed
with
me

*NL*
he
answered

``
I
asked
the
question

possible

for

the
only

indeed

that

one
for
asking

simple
curiosity

I
have
a
theory
that
it
is
always
the
*NL*
women
who
propose
to
us
,
and
not
we
who
propose
to
the
women
.
Except
,
*NL*
of
course
,
in
middle-class
life

But
then
the
middle
classes
are
not

modern

*NL*
Dorian
Gray
laughed

tossed
his

``
You
are
quite
incorrigible
,
*NL*
Harry
;
but
I
do
n't
mind
.
It
is
impossible
to
be
angry
with
you
.
When
*NL*
you
see
Sibyl
Vane
,
you
will
feel
that
the
man
who
could
wrong
her
*NL*
would
be
a
beast
,
a
beast
without
a
heart
.
I
can
not
understand
how
any
*NL*
one
can
wish
to
shame
the
thing
he
loves

I
love
Sibyl

I
want

to
place
her
on
a
pedestal
of
gold

to
see
the
world
worship
the

woman

is
mine

What
is
marriage
?
An
irrevocable
vow

You
mock
at
*NL*
it

that

Ah

do
n't

It
is
an
irrevocable
vow

I

take

Her

her
belief
makes
me
good

When

am
with
her

I
regret
all
that
you
have
taught
me

I
become
different

from
what
you
have
known
me
to
be

I
am
changed

the
mere
touch
of

Sibyl

himself
to
some

*NL*

Oh

Pleasure

voice

``
But
I
am
afraid

Pleasure
is
Nature

test

her
sign
of
approval

When

good

*NL*
``
Ah

Basil

*NL*
``
Yes

echoed
Dorian
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
at
Lord
*NL*
Henry
over
the
heavy
clusters
of
purple-lipped
irises
that
stood
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
table
,
``
what
do
you
mean
by
good

Harry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
good
is
to
be
in
harmony
with
one

self

''
he
replied
,
touching
*NL*
the
thin
stem
of
his
glass
with
his
pale
,
fine-pointed
fingers
.
*NL*
``
Discord
is
to
be
forced
to
be

One
's

the
important

As
for
the
lives

one

*NL*
neighbours
,
if
one
wishes
to
be
a
prig

a
Puritan
,
one
can
flaunt
*NL*
one

moral

they
are
not

Besides
,
*NL*
individualism
has
really
the
higher
aim

Modern
morality
consists
in
*NL*
accepting
the
standard
of
one

age

I
consider
that
for
any
man
of
*NL*
culture
to
accept
the
standard
of
his
age

a
form
of
the
grossest

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
surely

one

doing
so

suggested
the
painter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

we
are
overcharged

I
should
fancy
that

the
real
tragedy

is
that
they
can
afford
nothing

self-denial

Beautiful

*NL*
Lord

his

``
My

mediaeval
art

then

only
things
that

the

Believe

*NL*
no
civilized
man

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

certainly
better
than
being
adored

''
he
answered
,
toying
with
*NL*
some
fruits
.
``
Being
adored
is
a
nuisance

Women
treat

the

gravely

Dorian

*NL*
They
got
up
and
put
on
their
coats
,
sipping
their
coffee
standing
.
The
*NL*
painter
was
silent
and
preoccupied
.
There
was
a
gloom
over
him
.
He
*NL*
could
not
bear
this
marriage
,
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
better
*NL*
than
many
other
things
that
might
have
happened
.
After
a
few
minutes
,
*NL*
they
all
passed
downstairs
.
He
drove
off
by
himself
,
as
had
been
*NL*
arranged
,
and
watched
the
flashing
lights
of
the
little
brougham
in
*NL*
front
of
him
.
A
strange
sense
of
loss
came
over
him
.
He
felt
that
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
would
never
again
be
to
him
all
that
he
had
been
in
the
*NL*
past
.
Life
had
come
between
them
...
His
eyes
darkened
,
and
the
*NL*
crowded
flaring
streets
became
blurred
to
his
eyes
.
When
the
cab
drew
*NL*
up
at
the
theatre
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
grown
years
older

CHAPTER
7
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
reason
or
other
,
the
house
was
crowded
that
night
,
and
the
fat
*NL*
Jew
manager
who
met
them
at
the
door
was
beaming
from
ear
to
ear
with
*NL*
an
oily
tremulous
smile
.
He
escorted
them
to
their
box
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
pompous
humility
,
waving
his
fat
jewelled
hands
and
talking
at
the
top
*NL*
of
his
voice
.
Dorian
Gray
loathed
him
more
than
ever
.
He
felt
as
if
*NL*
he
had
come
to
look
for
Miranda
and
had
been
met
by
Caliban
.
Lord
*NL*
Henry
,
upon
the
other
hand
,
rather
liked
him
.
At
least
he
declared
he
*NL*
did
,
and
insisted
on
shaking
him
by
the
hand
and
assuring
him
that
he
*NL*
was
proud
to
meet
a
man
who
had
discovered
a
real
genius
and
gone
*NL*
bankrupt
over
a
poet
.
Hallward
amused
himself
with
watching
the
faces
*NL*
in
the
pit
.
The
heat
was
terribly
oppressive
,
and
the
huge
sunlight
*NL*
flamed
like
a
monstrous
dahlia
with
petals
of
yellow
fire
.
The
youths
*NL*
in
the
gallery
had
taken
off
their
coats
and
waistcoats
and
hung
them
*NL*
over
the
side
.
They
talked
to
each
other
across
the
theatre
and
shared
*NL*
their
oranges
with
the
tawdry
girls
who
sat
beside
them
.
Some
women
*NL*
were
laughing
in
the
pit
.
Their
voices
were
horribly
shrill
and
*NL*
discordant
.
The
sound
of
the
popping
of
corks
came
from
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
place
to
find
one
's
divinity
in
!
''
said
Lord
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
answered
Dorian
Gray
.
``
It
was
here
I
found
her
,
and
she
is
*NL*
divine
beyond
all
living
things
.
When
she
acts
,
you
will
forget
*NL*
everything
.
These
common
rough
people
,
with
their
coarse
faces
and
*NL*
brutal
gestures
,
become
quite
different
when
she
is
on
the
stage
.
They
*NL*
sit
silently
and
watch
her
.
They
weep
and
laugh
as
she
wills
them
to
*NL*
do
.
She
makes
them
as
responsive
as
a
violin
.
She
spiritualizes
them
,
*NL*
and
one
feels
that
they
are
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
one
's
self
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
flesh
and
blood
as
one
's
self
!
Oh
,
I
hope
not
!
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Lord
Henry
,
who
was
scanning
the
occupants
of
the
gallery
through
his
*NL*
opera-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
pay
any
attention
to
him
,
Dorian
,
''
said
the
painter
.
``
I
*NL*
understand
what
you
mean
,
and
I
believe
in
this
girl
.
Any
one
you
love
*NL*
must
be
marvellous
,
and
any
girl
who
has
the
effect
you
describe
must
*NL*
be
fine
and
noble
.
To
spiritualize
one
's
age
--
that
is
something
worth
*NL*
doing
.
If
this
girl
can
give
a
soul
to
those
who
have
lived
without
*NL*
one
,
if
she
can
create
the
sense
of
beauty
in
people
whose
lives
have
*NL*
been
sordid
and
ugly
,
if
she
can
strip
them
of
their
selfishness
and
*NL*
lend
them
tears
for
sorrows
that
are
not
their
own
,
she
is
worthy
of
*NL*
all
your
adoration
,
worthy
of
the
adoration
of
the
world
.
This
*NL*
marriage
is
quite
right
.
I
did
not
think
so
at
first
,
but
I
admit
it
*NL*
now
.
The
gods
made
Sibyl
Vane
for
you
.
Without
her
you
would
have
*NL*
been
incomplete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks

Basil

answered
Dorian
Gray
,
pressing
his
hand
.
``
I
knew
that
*NL*
you
would
understand
me

Harry
is
so
cynical

he
terrifies
me

here
is
the
orchestra
.
It
is
quite
dreadful
,
but
it
only
lasts
for
*NL*
about
five
minutes

Then
the
curtain
rises
,
and
you
will
see
the
girl
*NL*
to
whom
I
am
going
to
give
all
my
life
,
to
whom
I
have
given
everything
*NL*
that
is
good
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
,
amidst
an
extraordinary
turmoil
of
*NL*
applause
,
Sibyl
Vane
stepped
on
to
the
stage
.
Yes
,
she
was
certainly
*NL*
lovely
to
look
at
--
one
of
the
loveliest
creatures
,
Lord
Henry
thought
,
*NL*
that
he
had
ever
seen
.
There
was
something
of
the
fawn
in
her
shy
*NL*
grace
and
startled
eyes
.
A
faint
blush
,
like
the
shadow
of
a
rose
in
a
*NL*
mirror
of
silver
,
came
to
her
cheeks
as
she
glanced
at
the
crowded
*NL*
enthusiastic
house
.
She
stepped
back
a
few
paces
and
her
lips
seemed
*NL*
to
tremble
.
Basil
Hallward
leaped
to
his
feet
and
began
to
applaud
.
*NL*
Motionless
,
and
as
one
in
a
dream
,
sat
Dorian
Gray
,
gazing
at
her
.
*NL*
Lord
Henry
peered
through
his
glasses
,
murmuring
,
``
Charming
!
charming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
was
the
hall
of
Capulet
's
house
,
and
Romeo
in
his
pilgrim
's
*NL*
dress
had
entered
with
Mercutio
and
his
other
friends
.
The
band
,
such
*NL*
as
it
was
,
struck
up
a
few
bars
of
music
,
and
the
dance
began
.
Through
*NL*
the
crowd
of
ungainly
,
shabbily
dressed
actors
,
Sibyl
Vane
moved
like
a
*NL*
creature
from
a
finer
world
.
Her
body
swayed
,
while
she
danced
,
as
a
*NL*
plant
sways
in
the
water
.
The
curves
of
her
throat
were
the
curves
of
*NL*
a
white
lily
.
Her
hands
seemed
to
be
made
of
cool
ivory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
she
was
curiously
listless
.
She
showed
no
sign
of
joy
when
her
*NL*
eyes
rested
on
Romeo
.
The
few
words
she
had
to
speak
--
*NL*
*NL*
Good
pilgrim
,
you
do
wrong
your
hand
too
much
,
*NL*
Which
mannerly
devotion
shows
in
this
;
*NL*
For
saints
have
hands
that
pilgrims
'
hands
do
touch
,
*NL*
And
palm
to
palm
is
holy
palmers
'
kiss
--
*NL*
*NL*
with
the
brief
dialogue
that
follows
,
were
spoken
in
a
thoroughly
*NL*
artificial
manner
.
The
voice
was
exquisite
,
but
from
the
point
of
view
*NL*
of
tone
it
was
absolutely
false
.
It
was
wrong
in
colour
.
It
took
away
*NL*
all
the
life
from
the
verse
.
It
made
the
passion
unreal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
grew
pale
as
he
watched
her
.
He
was
puzzled
and
anxious
.
*NL*
Neither
of
his
friends
dared
to
say
anything
to
him
.
She
seemed
to
*NL*
them
to
be
absolutely
incompetent
.
They
were
horribly
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
they
felt
that
the
true
test
of
any
Juliet
is
the
balcony
scene
of
*NL*
the
second
act
.
They
waited
for
that
.
If
she
failed
there
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
charming
as
she
came
out
in
the
moonlight
.
That
could
not
*NL*
be
denied
.
But
the
staginess
of
her
acting
was
unbearable
,
and
grew
*NL*
worse
as
she
went
on
.
Her
gestures
became
absurdly
artificial
.
She
*NL*
overemphasized
everything
that
she
had
to
say
.
The
beautiful
passage
--
*NL*
*NL*
Thou
knowest
the
mask
of
night
is
on
my
face
,
*NL*
Else
would
a
maiden
blush
bepaint
my
cheek
*NL*
For
that
which
thou
hast
heard
me
speak
to-night
--
*NL*
*NL*
was
declaimed
with
the
painful
precision
of
a
schoolgirl
who
has
been
*NL*
taught
to
recite
by
some
second-rate
professor
of
elocution
.
When
she
*NL*
leaned
over
the
balcony
and
came
to
those
wonderful
lines
--
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
joy
in
thee
,
*NL*
I
have
no
joy
of
this
contract
to-night
:
*NL*
It
is
too
rash
,
too
unadvised
,
too
sudden
;
*NL*
Too
like
the
lightning
,
which
doth
cease
to
be
*NL*
Ere
one
can
say
,
``
It
lightens
.
''
Sweet
,
good-night
!
*NL*
This
bud
of
love
by
summer
's
ripening
breath
*NL*
May
prove
a
beauteous
flower
when
next
we
meet
--
*NL*
*NL*
she
spoke
the
words
as
though
they
conveyed
no
meaning
to
her
.
It
was
*NL*
not
nervousness
.
Indeed
,
so
far
from
being
nervous
,
she
was
absolutely
*NL*
self-contained
.
It
was
simply
bad
art
.
She
was
a
complete
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
common
uneducated
audience
of
the
pit
and
gallery
lost
their
*NL*
interest
in
the
play
.
They
got
restless
,
and
began
to
talk
loudly
and
*NL*
to
whistle
.
The
Jew
manager
,
who
was
standing
at
the
back
of
the
*NL*
dress-circle
,
stamped
and
swore
with
rage
.
The
only
person
unmoved
was
*NL*
the
girl
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
second
act
was
over
,
there
came
a
storm
of
hisses
,
and
Lord
*NL*
Henry
got
up
from
his
chair
and
put
on
his
coat
.
``
She
is
quite
*NL*
beautiful
,
Dorian
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
she
ca
n't
act
.
Let
us
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
see
the
play
through
,
''
answered
the
lad
,
in
a
hard
*NL*
bitter
voice
.
``
I
am
awfully
sorry
that
I
have
made
you
waste
an
*NL*
evening
,
Harry
.
I
apologize
to
you
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Dorian
,
I
should
think
Miss
Vane
was
ill
,
''
interrupted
*NL*
Hallward
.
``
We
will
come
some
other
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
she
were
ill
,
''
he
rejoined
.
``
But
she
seems
to
me
to
be
simply
*NL*
callous
and
cold
.
She
has
entirely
altered
.
Last
night
she
was
a
*NL*
great
artist
.
This
evening
she
is
merely
a
commonplace
mediocre
*NL*
actress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
like
that
about
any
one
you
love
,
Dorian
.
Love
is
a
more
*NL*
wonderful
thing
than
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
both
simply
forms
of
imitation
,
''
remarked
Lord
Henry
.
``
But
*NL*
do
let
us
go
.
Dorian
,
you
must
not
stay
here
any
longer
.
It
is
not
*NL*
good
for
one
's
morals
to
see
bad
acting
.
Besides
,
I
do
n't
suppose
you
*NL*
will
want
your
wife
to
act
,
so
what
does
it
matter
if
she
plays
Juliet
*NL*
like
a
wooden
doll
?
She
is
very
lovely
,
and
if
she
knows
as
little
*NL*
about
life
as
she
does
about
acting
,
she
will
be
a
delightful
*NL*
experience
.
There
are
only
two
kinds
of
people
who
are
really
*NL*
fascinating
--
people
who
know
absolutely
everything
,
and
people
who
know
*NL*
absolutely
nothing
.
Good
heavens
,
my
dear
boy
,
do
n't
look
so
tragic
!
*NL*
The
secret
of
remaining
young
is
never
to
have
an
emotion
that
is
*NL*
unbecoming
.
Come
to
the
club
with
Basil
and
myself
.
We
will
smoke
*NL*
cigarettes
and
drink
to
the
beauty
of
Sibyl
Vane
.
She
is
beautiful
.
*NL*
What
more
can
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
Harry
,
''
cried
the
lad
.
``
I
want
to
be
alone
.
Basil
,
you
must
*NL*
go
.
Ah
!
ca
n't
you
see
that
my
heart
is
breaking
?
''
The
hot
tears
came
*NL*
to
his
eyes
.
His
lips
trembled
,
and
rushing
to
the
back
of
the
box
,
he
*NL*
leaned
up
against
the
wall
,
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
Basil
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
with
a
strange
tenderness
in
his
*NL*
voice
,
and
the
two
young
men
passed
out
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
afterwards
the
footlights
flared
up
and
the
curtain
rose
*NL*
on
the
third
act
.
Dorian
Gray
went
back
to
his
seat
.
He
looked
pale
,
*NL*
and
proud
,
and
indifferent
.
The
play
dragged
on
,
and
seemed
*NL*
interminable
.
Half
of
the
audience
went
out
,
tramping
in
heavy
boots
*NL*
and
laughing
.
The
whole
thing
was
a
_
fiasco
_
.
The
last
act
was
played
*NL*
to
almost
empty
benches
.
The
curtain
went
down
on
a
titter
and
some
*NL*
groans
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
it
was
over
,
Dorian
Gray
rushed
behind
the
scenes
into
the
*NL*
greenroom
.
The
girl
was
standing
there
alone
,
with
a
look
of
triumph
*NL*
on
her
face
.
Her
eyes
were
lit
with
an
exquisite
fire
.
There
was
a
*NL*
radiance
about
her
.
Her
parted
lips
were
smiling
over
some
secret
of
*NL*
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
entered
,
she
looked
at
him
,
and
an
expression
of
infinite
joy
*NL*
came
over
her
.
``
How
badly
I
acted
to-night
,
Dorian
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Horribly
!
''
he
answered
,
gazing
at
her
in
amazement
.
``
Horribly
!
It
*NL*
was
dreadful
.
Are
you
ill
?
You
have
no
idea
what
it
was
.
You
have
no
*NL*
idea
what
I
suffered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
smiled
.
``
Dorian
,
''
she
answered
,
lingering
over
his
name
with
*NL*
long-drawn
music
in
her
voice
,
as
though
it
were
sweeter
than
honey
to
*NL*
the
red
petals
of
her
mouth
.
``
Dorian
,
you
should
have
understood
.
But
*NL*
you
understand
now
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Understand
what
?
''
he
asked
,
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
I
was
so
bad
to-night
.
Why
I
shall
always
be
bad
.
Why
I
shall
*NL*
never
act
well
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
You
are
ill
,
I
suppose
.
When
you
are
ill
*NL*
you
should
n't
act
.
You
make
yourself
ridiculous
.
My
friends
were
*NL*
bored
.
I
was
bored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
not
to
listen
to
him
.
She
was
transfigured
with
joy
.
An
*NL*
ecstasy
of
happiness
dominated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
,
Dorian
,
''
she
cried
,
``
before
I
knew
you
,
acting
was
the
one
*NL*
reality
of
my
life
.
It
was
only
in
the
theatre
that
I
lived
.
I
*NL*
thought
that
it
was
all
true
.
I
was
Rosalind
one
night
and
Portia
the
*NL*
other
.
The
joy
of
Beatrice
was
my
joy
,
and
the
sorrows
of
Cordelia
*NL*
were
mine
also
.
I
believed
in
everything
.
The
common
people
who
acted
*NL*
with
me
seemed
to
me
to
be
godlike
.
The
painted
scenes
were
my
world
.
*NL*
I
knew
nothing
but
shadows
,
and
I
thought
them
real
.
You
came
--
oh
,
my
*NL*
beautiful
love
!
--
and
you
freed
my
soul
from
prison
.
You
taught
me
what
*NL*
reality
really
is
.
To-night
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
I
saw
*NL*
through
the
hollowness
,
the
sham
,
the
silliness
of
the
empty
pageant
in
*NL*
which
I
had
always
played
.
To-night
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
became
*NL*
conscious
that
the
Romeo
was
hideous
,
and
old
,
and
painted
,
that
the
*NL*
moonlight
in
the
orchard
was
false
,
that
the
scenery
was
vulgar
,
and
*NL*
that
the
words
I
had
to
speak
were
unreal
,
were
not
my
words
,
were
not
*NL*
what
I
wanted
to
say
.
You
had
brought
me
something
higher
,
something
*NL*
of
which
all
art
is
but
a
reflection
.
You
had
made
me
understand
what
*NL*
love
really
is
.
My
love
!
My
love
!
Prince
Charming
!
Prince
of
life
!
*NL*
I
have
grown
sick
of
shadows
.
You
are
more
to
me
than
all
art
can
ever
*NL*
be
.
What
have
I
to
do
with
the
puppets
of
a
play
?
When
I
came
on
*NL*
to-night
,
I
could
not
understand
how
it
was
that
everything
had
gone
*NL*
from
me
.
I
thought
that
I
was
going
to
be
wonderful
.
I
found
that
I
*NL*
could
do
nothing
.
Suddenly
it
dawned
on
my
soul
what
it
all
meant
.
*NL*
The
knowledge
was
exquisite
to
me
.
I
heard
them
hissing
,
and
I
smiled
.
*NL*
What
could
they
know
of
love
such
as
ours
?
Take
me
away
,
Dorian
--
take
*NL*
me
away
with
you
,
where
we
can
be
quite
alone
.
I
hate
the
stage
.
I
*NL*
might
mimic
a
passion
that
I
do
not
feel
,
but
I
can
not
mimic
one
that
*NL*
burns
me
like
fire
.
Oh
,
Dorian
,
Dorian
,
you
understand
now
what
it
*NL*
signifies
?
Even
if
I
could
do
it
,
it
would
be
profanation
for
me
to
*NL*
play
at
being
in
love
.
You
have
made
me
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
flung
himself
down
on
the
sofa
and
turned
away
his
face
.
``
You
have
*NL*
killed
my
love
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
in
wonder
and
laughed
.
He
made
no
answer
.
She
came
*NL*
across
to
him
,
and
with
her
little
fingers
stroked
his
hair
.
She
knelt
*NL*
down
and
pressed
his
hands
to
her
lips
.
He
drew
them
away
,
and
a
*NL*
shudder
ran
through
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
leaped
up
and
went
to
the
door
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
cried
,
``
you
have
*NL*
killed
my
love
.
You
used
to
stir
my
imagination
.
Now
you
do
n't
even
*NL*
stir
my
curiosity
.
You
simply
produce
no
effect
.
I
loved
you
because
*NL*
you
were
marvellous
,
because
you
had
genius
and
intellect
,
because
you
*NL*
realized
the
dreams
of
great
poets
and
gave
shape
and
substance
to
the
*NL*
shadows
of
art
.
You
have
thrown
it
all
away
.
You
are
shallow
and
*NL*
stupid
.
My
God
!
how
mad
I
was
to
love
you
!
What
a
fool
I
have
been
!
*NL*
You
are
nothing
to
me
now
.
I
will
never
see
you
again
.
I
will
never
*NL*
think
of
you
.
I
will
never
mention
your
name
.
You
do
n't
know
what
you
*NL*
were
to
me
,
once
.
Why
,
once
...
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
bear
to
think
of
it
!
I
*NL*
wish
I
had
never
laid
eyes
upon
you
!
You
have
spoiled
the
romance
of
*NL*
my
life
.
How
little
you
can
know
of
love
,
if
you
say
it
mars
your
art
!
*NL*
Without
your
art
,
you
are
nothing
.
I
would
have
made
you
famous
,
*NL*
splendid
,
magnificent
.
The
world
would
have
worshipped
you
,
and
you
*NL*
would
have
borne
my
name
.
What
are
you
now
?
A
third-rate
actress
with
*NL*
a
pretty
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
grew
white
,
and
trembled
.
She
clenched
her
hands
together
,
*NL*
and
her
voice
seemed
to
catch
in
her
throat
.
``
You
are
not
serious
,
*NL*
Dorian
?
''
she
murmured
.
``
You
are
acting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Acting
!
I
leave
that
to
you
.
You
do
it
so
well
,
''
he
answered
*NL*
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
from
her
knees
and
,
with
a
piteous
expression
of
pain
in
her
*NL*
face
,
came
across
the
room
to
him
.
She
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
*NL*
looked
into
his
eyes
.
He
thrust
her
back
.
``
Do
n't
touch
me
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
low
moan
broke
from
her
,
and
she
flung
herself
at
his
feet
and
lay
*NL*
there
like
a
trampled
flower
.
``
Dorian
,
Dorian
,
do
n't
leave
me
!
''
she
*NL*
whispered
.
``
I
am
so
sorry
I
did
n't
act
well
.
I
was
thinking
of
you
*NL*
all
the
time
.
But
I
will
try
--
indeed
,
I
will
try
.
It
came
so
suddenly
*NL*
across
me
,
my
love
for
you
.
I
think
I
should
never
have
known
it
if
*NL*
you
had
not
kissed
me
--
if
we
had
not
kissed
each
other
.
Kiss
me
again
,
*NL*
my
love
.
Do
n't
go
away
from
me
.
I
could
n't
bear
it
.
Oh
!
do
n't
go
*NL*
away
from
me
.
My
brother
...
No
;
never
mind
.
He
did
n't
mean
it
.
He
*NL*
was
in
jest
...
But
you
,
oh
!
ca
n't
you
forgive
me
for
to-night
?
I
will
*NL*
work
so
hard
and
try
to
improve
.
Do
n't
be
cruel
to
me
,
because
I
love
*NL*
you
better
than
anything
in
the
world
.
After
all
,
it
is
only
once
that
*NL*
I
have
not
pleased
you
.
But
you
are
quite
right
,
Dorian
.
I
should
*NL*
have
shown
myself
more
of
an
artist
.
It
was
foolish
of
me
,
and
yet
I
*NL*
could
n't
help
it
.
Oh
,
do
n't
leave
me
,
do
n't
leave
me
.
''
A
fit
of
*NL*
passionate
sobbing
choked
her
.
She
crouched
on
the
floor
like
a
*NL*
wounded
thing
,
and
Dorian
Gray
,
with
his
beautiful
eyes
,
looked
down
at
*NL*
her
,
and
his
chiselled
lips
curled
in
exquisite
disdain
.
There
is
*NL*
always
something
ridiculous
about
the
emotions
of
people
whom
one
has
*NL*
ceased
to
love
.
Sibyl
Vane
seemed
to
him
to
be
absurdly
melodramatic
.
*NL*
Her
tears
and
sobs
annoyed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
,
''
he
said
at
last
in
his
calm
clear
voice
.
``
I
do
n't
wish
*NL*
to
be
unkind
,
but
I
ca
n't
see
you
again
.
You
have
disappointed
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wept
silently
,
and
made
no
answer
,
but
crept
nearer
.
Her
little
*NL*
hands
stretched
blindly
out
,
and
appeared
to
be
seeking
for
him
.
He
*NL*
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
room
.
In
a
few
moments
he
was
out
of
*NL*
the
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
he
went
to
he
hardly
knew
.
He
remembered
wandering
through
dimly
*NL*
lit
streets
,
past
gaunt
,
black-shadowed
archways
and
evil-looking
*NL*
houses
.
Women
with
hoarse
voices
and
harsh
laughter
had
called
after
*NL*
him
.
Drunkards
had
reeled
by
,
cursing
and
chattering
to
themselves
*NL*
like
monstrous
apes
.
He
had
seen
grotesque
children
huddled
upon
*NL*
door-steps
,
and
heard
shrieks
and
oaths
from
gloomy
courts
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
dawn
was
just
breaking
,
he
found
himself
close
to
Covent
Garden
.
*NL*
The
darkness
lifted
,
and
,
flushed
with
faint
fires
,
the
sky
hollowed
*NL*
itself
into
a
perfect
pearl
.
Huge
carts
filled
with
nodding
lilies
*NL*
rumbled
slowly
down
the
polished
empty
street
.
The
air
was
heavy
with
*NL*
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
,
and
their
beauty
seemed
to
bring
him
an
*NL*
anodyne
for
his
pain
.
He
followed
into
the
market
and
watched
the
men
*NL*
unloading
their
waggons
.
A
white-smocked
carter
offered
him
some
*NL*
cherries
.
He
thanked
him
,
wondered
why
he
refused
to
accept
any
money
*NL*
for
them
,
and
began
to
eat
them
listlessly
.
They
had
been
plucked
at
*NL*
midnight
,
and
the
coldness
of
the
moon
had
entered
into
them
.
A
long
*NL*
line
of
boys
carrying
crates
of
striped
tulips
,
and
of
yellow
and
red
*NL*
roses
,
defiled
in
front
of
him
,
threading
their
way
through
the
huge
,
*NL*
jade-green
piles
of
vegetables
.
Under
the
portico
,
with
its
grey
,
*NL*
sun-bleached
pillars
,
loitered
a
troop
of
draggled
bareheaded
girls
,
*NL*
waiting
for
the
auction
to
be
over
.
Others
crowded
round
the
swinging
*NL*
doors
of
the
coffee-house
in
the
piazza
.
The
heavy
cart-horses
slipped
*NL*
and
stamped
upon
the
rough
stones
,
shaking
their
bells
and
trappings
.
*NL*
Some
of
the
drivers
were
lying
asleep
on
a
pile
of
sacks
.
Iris-necked
*NL*
and
pink-footed
,
the
pigeons
ran
about
picking
up
seeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
while
,
he
hailed
a
hansom
and
drove
home
.
For
a
few
*NL*
moments
he
loitered
upon
the
doorstep
,
looking
round
at
the
silent
*NL*
square
,
with
its
blank
,
close-shuttered
windows
and
its
staring
blinds
.
*NL*
The
sky
was
pure
opal
now
,
and
the
roofs
of
the
houses
glistened
like
*NL*
silver
against
it
.
From
some
chimney
opposite
a
thin
wreath
of
smoke
*NL*
was
rising
.
It
curled
,
a
violet
riband
,
through
the
nacre-coloured
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
huge
gilt
Venetian
lantern
,
spoil
of
some
Doge
's
barge
,
that
*NL*
hung
from
the
ceiling
of
the
great
,
oak-panelled
hall
of
entrance
,
*NL*
lights
were
still
burning
from
three
flickering
jets
:
thin
blue
petals
*NL*
of
flame
they
seemed
,
rimmed
with
white
fire
.
He
turned
them
out
and
,
*NL*
having
thrown
his
hat
and
cape
on
the
table
,
passed
through
the
library
*NL*
towards
the
door
of
his
bedroom
,
a
large
octagonal
chamber
on
the
*NL*
ground
floor
that
,
in
his
new-born
feeling
for
luxury
,
he
had
just
had
*NL*
decorated
for
himself
and
hung
with
some
curious
Renaissance
tapestries
*NL*
that
had
been
discovered
stored
in
a
disused
attic
at
Selby
Royal
.
As
*NL*
he
was
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
,
his
eye
fell
upon
the
portrait
*NL*
Basil
Hallward
had
painted
of
him
.
He
started
back
as
if
in
surprise
.
*NL*
Then
he
went
on
into
his
own
room
,
looking
somewhat
puzzled
.
After
he
*NL*
had
taken
the
button-hole
out
of
his
coat
,
he
seemed
to
hesitate
.
*NL*
Finally
,
he
came
back
,
went
over
to
the
picture
,
and
examined
it
.
In
*NL*
the
dim
arrested
light
that
struggled
through
the
cream-coloured
silk
*NL*
blinds
,
the
face
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
little
changed
.
The
*NL*
expression
looked
different
.
One
would
have
said
that
there
was
a
*NL*
touch
of
cruelty
in
the
mouth
.
It
was
certainly
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
and
,
walking
to
the
window
,
drew
up
the
blind
.
The
*NL*
bright
dawn
flooded
the
room
and
swept
the
fantastic
shadows
into
dusky
*NL*
corners
,
where
they
lay
shuddering
.
But
the
strange
expression
that
he
*NL*
had
noticed
in
the
face
of
the
portrait
seemed
to
linger
there
,
to
be
*NL*
more
intensified
even
.
The
quivering
ardent
sunlight
showed
him
the
*NL*
lines
of
cruelty
round
the
mouth
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
been
looking
*NL*
into
a
mirror
after
he
had
done
some
dreadful
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
winced
and
,
taking
up
from
the
table
an
oval
glass
framed
in
ivory
*NL*
Cupids
,
one
of
Lord
Henry
's
many
presents
to
him
,
glanced
hurriedly
*NL*
into
its
polished
depths
.
No
line
like
that
warped
his
red
lips
.
What
*NL*
did
it
mean
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
rubbed
his
eyes
,
and
came
close
to
the
picture
,
and
examined
it
*NL*
again
.
There
were
no
signs
of
any
change
when
he
looked
into
the
*NL*
actual
painting
,
and
yet
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
whole
expression
*NL*
had
altered
.
It
was
not
a
mere
fancy
of
his
own
.
The
thing
was
*NL*
horribly
apparent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
began
to
think
.
Suddenly
there
*NL*
flashed
across
his
mind
what
he
had
said
in
Basil
Hallward
's
studio
the
*NL*
day
the
picture
had
been
finished
.
Yes
,
he
remembered
it
perfectly
.
*NL*
He
had
uttered
a
mad
wish
that
he
himself
might
remain
young
,
and
the
*NL*
portrait
grow
old
;
that
his
own
beauty
might
be
untarnished
,
and
the
*NL*
face
on
the
canvas
bear
the
burden
of
his
passions
and
his
sins
;
that
*NL*
the
painted
image
might
be
seared
with
the
lines
of
suffering
and
*NL*
thought
,
and
that
he
might
keep
all
the
delicate
bloom
and
loveliness
*NL*
of
his
then
just
conscious
boyhood
.
Surely
his
wish
had
not
been
*NL*
fulfilled
?
Such
things
were
impossible
.
It
seemed
monstrous
even
to
*NL*
think
of
them
.
And
,
yet
,
there
was
the
picture
before
him
,
with
the
*NL*
touch
of
cruelty
in
the
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cruelty
!
Had
he
been
cruel
?
It
was
the
girl
's
fault
,
not
his
.
He
had
*NL*
dreamed
of
her
as
a
great
artist
,
had
given
his
love
to
her
because
he
*NL*
had
thought
her
great
.
Then
she
had
disappointed
him
.
She
had
been
*NL*
shallow
and
unworthy
.
And
,
yet
,
a
feeling
of
infinite
regret
came
over
*NL*
him
,
as
he
thought
of
her
lying
at
his
feet
sobbing
like
a
little
*NL*
child
.
He
remembered
with
what
callousness
he
had
watched
her
.
Why
*NL*
had
he
been
made
like
that
?
Why
had
such
a
soul
been
given
to
him
?
*NL*
But
he
had
suffered
also
.
During
the
three
terrible
hours
that
the
*NL*
play
had
lasted
,
he
had
lived
centuries
of
pain
,
aeon
upon
aeon
of
*NL*
torture
.
His
life
was
well
worth
hers
.
She
had
marred
him
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
if
he
had
wounded
her
for
an
age
.
Besides
,
women
were
better
*NL*
suited
to
bear
sorrow
than
men
.
They
lived
on
their
emotions
.
They
*NL*
only
thought
of
their
emotions
.
When
they
took
lovers
,
it
was
merely
*NL*
to
have
some
one
with
whom
they
could
have
scenes
.
Lord
Henry
had
told
*NL*
him
that
,
and
Lord
Henry
knew
what
women
were
.
Why
should
he
trouble
*NL*
about
Sibyl
Vane
?
She
was
nothing
to
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
picture
?
What
was
he
to
say
of
that
?
It
held
the
secret
of
*NL*
his
life
,
and
told
his
story
.
It
had
taught
him
to
love
his
own
*NL*
beauty
.
Would
it
teach
him
to
loathe
his
own
soul
?
Would
he
ever
look
*NL*
at
it
again
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
;
it
was
merely
an
illusion
wrought
on
the
troubled
senses
.
The
*NL*
horrible
night
that
he
had
passed
had
left
phantoms
behind
it
.
*NL*
Suddenly
there
had
fallen
upon
his
brain
that
tiny
scarlet
speck
that
*NL*
makes
men
mad
.
The
picture
had
not
changed
.
It
was
folly
to
think
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
was
watching
him
,
with
its
beautiful
marred
face
and
its
cruel
*NL*
smile
.
Its
bright
hair
gleamed
in
the
early
sunlight
.
Its
blue
eyes
*NL*
met
his
own
.
A
sense
of
infinite
pity
,
not
for
himself
,
but
for
the
*NL*
painted
image
of
himself
,
came
over
him
.
It
had
altered
already
,
and
*NL*
would
alter
more
.
Its
gold
would
wither
into
grey
.
Its
red
and
white
*NL*
roses
would
die
.
For
every
sin
that
he
committed
,
a
stain
would
fleck
*NL*
and
wreck
its
fairness
.
But
he
would
not
sin
.
The
picture
,
changed
or
*NL*
unchanged
,
would
be
to
him
the
visible
emblem
of
conscience
.
He
would
*NL*
resist
temptation
.
He
would
not
see
Lord
Henry
any
more
--
would
not
,
at
*NL*
any
rate
,
listen
to
those
subtle
poisonous
theories
that
in
Basil
*NL*
Hallward
's
garden
had
first
stirred
within
him
the
passion
for
*NL*
impossible
things
.
He
would
go
back
to
Sibyl
Vane
,
make
her
amends
,
*NL*
marry
her
,
try
to
love
her
again
.
Yes
,
it
was
his
duty
to
do
so
.
She
*NL*
must
have
suffered
more
than
he
had
.
Poor
child
!
He
had
been
selfish
*NL*
and
cruel
to
her
.
The
fascination
that
she
had
exercised
over
him
*NL*
would
return
.
They
would
be
happy
together
.
His
life
with
her
would
*NL*
be
beautiful
and
pure
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
from
his
chair
and
drew
a
large
screen
right
in
front
of
the
*NL*
portrait
,
shuddering
as
he
glanced
at
it
.
``
How
horrible
!
''
he
murmured
*NL*
to
himself
,
and
he
walked
across
to
the
window
and
opened
it
.
When
he
*NL*
stepped
out
on
to
the
grass
,
he
drew
a
deep
breath
.
The
fresh
morning
*NL*
air
seemed
to
drive
away
all
his
sombre
passions
.
He
thought
only
of
*NL*
Sibyl
.
A
faint
echo
of
his
love
came
back
to
him
.
He
repeated
her
*NL*
name
over
and
over
again
.
The
birds
that
were
singing
in
the
*NL*
dew-drenched
garden
seemed
to
be
telling
the
flowers
about
her
.

CHAPTER
8
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
past
noon
when
he
awoke
.
His
valet
had
crept
several
times
*NL*
on
tiptoe
into
the
room
to
see
if
he
was
stirring
,
and
had
wondered
*NL*
what
made
his
young
master
sleep
so
late
.
Finally
his
bell
sounded
,
*NL*
and
Victor
came
in
softly
with
a
cup
of
tea
,
and
a
pile
of
letters
,
on
*NL*
a
small
tray
of
old
Sevres
china
,
and
drew
back
the
olive-satin
*NL*
curtains
,
with
their
shimmering
blue
lining
,
that
hung
in
front
of
the
*NL*
three
tall
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
has
well
slept
this
morning
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
o'clock
is
it
,
Victor
?
''
asked
Dorian
Gray
drowsily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
hour
and
a
quarter
,
Monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
late
it
was
!
He
sat
up
,
and
having
sipped
some
tea
,
turned
over
*NL*
his
letters
.
One
of
them
was
from
Lord
Henry
,
and
had
been
brought
by
*NL*
hand
that
morning
.
He
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
then
put
it
aside
.
*NL*
The
others
he
opened
listlessly
.
They
contained
the
usual
collection
*NL*
of
cards
,
invitations
to
dinner
,
tickets
for
private
views
,
programmes
*NL*
of
charity
concerts
,
and
the
like
that
are
showered
on
fashionable
*NL*
young
men
every
morning
during
the
season
.
There
was
a
rather
heavy
*NL*
bill
for
a
chased
silver
Louis-Quinze
toilet-set
that
he
had
not
yet
*NL*
had
the
courage
to
send
on
to
his
guardians
,
who
were
extremely
*NL*
old-fashioned
people
and
did
not
realize
that
we
live
in
an
age
when
*NL*
unnecessary
things
are
our
only
necessities
;
and
there
were
several
*NL*
very
courteously
worded
communications
from
Jermyn
Street
money-lenders
*NL*
offering
to
advance
any
sum
of
money
at
a
moment
's
notice
and
at
the
*NL*
most
reasonable
rates
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
about
ten
minutes
he
got
up
,
and
throwing
on
an
elaborate
*NL*
dressing-gown
of
silk-embroidered
cashmere
wool
,
passed
into
the
*NL*
onyx-paved
bathroom
.
The
cool
water
refreshed
him
after
his
long
*NL*
sleep
.
He
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
that
he
had
gone
through
.
A
*NL*
dim
sense
of
having
taken
part
in
some
strange
tragedy
came
to
him
once
*NL*
or
twice
,
but
there
was
the
unreality
of
a
dream
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
was
dressed
,
he
went
into
the
library
and
sat
down
to
a
*NL*
light
French
breakfast
that
had
been
laid
out
for
him
on
a
small
round
*NL*
table
close
to
the
open
window
.
It
was
an
exquisite
day
.
The
warm
air
*NL*
seemed
laden
with
spices
.
A
bee
flew
in
and
buzzed
round
the
*NL*
blue-dragon
bowl
that
,
filled
with
sulphur-yellow
roses
,
stood
before
*NL*
him
.
He
felt
perfectly
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
his
eye
fell
on
the
screen
that
he
had
placed
in
front
of
the
*NL*
portrait
,
and
he
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
cold
for
Monsieur
?
''
asked
his
valet
,
putting
an
omelette
on
the
*NL*
table
.
``
I
shut
the
window
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
shook
his
head
.
``
I
am
not
cold
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
all
true
?
Had
the
portrait
really
changed
?
Or
had
it
been
*NL*
simply
his
own
imagination
that
had
made
him
see
a
look
of
evil
where
*NL*
there
had
been
a
look
of
joy
?
Surely
a
painted
canvas
could
not
alter
?
*NL*
The
thing
was
absurd
.
It
would
serve
as
a
tale
to
tell
Basil
some
day
.
*NL*
It
would
make
him
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
yet
,
how
vivid
was
his
recollection
of
the
whole
thing
!
First
in
*NL*
the
dim
twilight
,
and
then
in
the
bright
dawn
,
he
had
seen
the
touch
of
*NL*
cruelty
round
the
warped
lips
.
He
almost
dreaded
his
valet
leaving
the
*NL*
room
.
He
knew
that
when
he
was
alone
he
would
have
to
examine
the
*NL*
portrait
.
He
was
afraid
of
certainty
.
When
the
coffee
and
cigarettes
*NL*
had
been
brought
and
the
man
turned
to
go
,
he
felt
a
wild
desire
to
*NL*
tell
him
to
remain
.
As
the
door
was
closing
behind
him
,
he
called
him
*NL*
back
.
The
man
stood
waiting
for
his
orders
.
Dorian
looked
at
him
for
*NL*
a
moment
.
``
I
am
not
at
home
to
any
one
,
Victor
,
''
he
said
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
The
man
bowed
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
rose
from
the
table
,
lit
a
cigarette
,
and
flung
himself
down
on
*NL*
a
luxuriously
cushioned
couch
that
stood
facing
the
screen
.
The
screen
*NL*
was
an
old
one
,
of
gilt
Spanish
leather
,
stamped
and
wrought
with
a
*NL*
rather
florid
Louis-Quatorze
pattern
.
He
scanned
it
curiously
,
*NL*
wondering
if
ever
before
it
had
concealed
the
secret
of
a
man
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Should
he
move
it
aside
,
after
all
?
Why
not
let
it
stay
there
?
What
*NL*
was
the
use
of
knowing
?
If
the
thing
was
true
,
it
was
terrible
.
If
it
*NL*
was
not
true
,
why
trouble
about
it
?
But
what
if
,
by
some
fate
or
*NL*
deadlier
chance
,
eyes
other
than
his
spied
behind
and
saw
the
horrible
*NL*
change
?
What
should
he
do
if
Basil
Hallward
came
and
asked
to
look
at
*NL*
his
own
picture
?
Basil
would
be
sure
to
do
that
.
No
;
the
thing
had
to
*NL*
be
examined
,
and
at
once
.
Anything
would
be
better
than
this
dreadful
*NL*
state
of
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
locked
both
doors
.
At
least
he
would
be
alone
when
he
*NL*
looked
upon
the
mask
of
his
shame
.
Then
he
drew
the
screen
aside
and
*NL*
saw
himself
face
to
face
.
It
was
perfectly
true
.
The
portrait
had
*NL*
altered
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
often
remembered
afterwards
,
and
always
with
no
small
wonder
,
he
*NL*
found
himself
at
first
gazing
at
the
portrait
with
a
feeling
of
almost
*NL*
scientific
interest
.
That
such
a
change
should
have
taken
place
was
*NL*
incredible
to
him
.
And
yet
it
was
a
fact
.
Was
there
some
subtle
*NL*
affinity
between
the
chemical
atoms
that
shaped
themselves
into
form
*NL*
and
colour
on
the
canvas
and
the
soul
that
was
within
him
?
Could
it
be
*NL*
that
what
that
soul
thought
,
they
realized
?
--
that
what
it
dreamed
,
they
*NL*
made
true
?
Or
was
there
some
other
,
more
terrible
reason
?
He
*NL*
shuddered
,
and
felt
afraid
,
and
,
going
back
to
the
couch
,
lay
there
,
*NL*
gazing
at
the
picture
in
sickened
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
,
however
,
he
felt
that
it
had
done
for
him
.
It
had
made
him
*NL*
conscious
how
unjust
,
how
cruel
,
he
had
been
to
Sibyl
Vane
.
It
was
not
*NL*
too
late
to
make
reparation
for
that
.
She
could
still
be
his
wife
.
*NL*
His
unreal
and
selfish
love
would
yield
to
some
higher
influence
,
would
*NL*
be
transformed
into
some
nobler
passion
,
and
the
portrait
that
Basil
*NL*
Hallward
had
painted
of
him
would
be
a
guide
to
him
through
life
,
would
*NL*
be
to
him
what
holiness
is
to
some
,
and
conscience
to
others
,
and
the
*NL*
fear
of
God
to
us
all
.
There
were
opiates
for
remorse
,
drugs
that
*NL*
could
lull
the
moral
sense
to
sleep
.
But
here
was
a
visible
symbol
of
*NL*
the
degradation
of
sin
.
Here
was
an
ever-present
sign
of
the
ruin
men
*NL*
brought
upon
their
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
o'clock
struck
,
and
four
,
and
the
half-hour
rang
its
double
*NL*
chime
,
but
Dorian
Gray
did
not
stir
.
He
was
trying
to
gather
up
the
*NL*
scarlet
threads
of
life
and
to
weave
them
into
a
pattern
;
to
find
his
*NL*
way
through
the
sanguine
labyrinth
of
passion
through
which
he
was
*NL*
wandering
.
He
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
or
what
to
think
.
Finally
,
he
*NL*
went
over
to
the
table
and
wrote
a
passionate
letter
to
the
girl
he
had
*NL*
loved
,
imploring
her
forgiveness
and
accusing
himself
of
madness
.
He
*NL*
covered
page
after
page
with
wild
words
of
sorrow
and
wilder
words
of
*NL*
pain
.
There
is
a
luxury
in
self-reproach
.
When
we
blame
ourselves
,
we
*NL*
feel
that
no
one
else
has
a
right
to
blame
us
.
It
is
the
confession
,
*NL*
not
the
priest
,
that
gives
us
absolution
.
When
Dorian
had
finished
the
*NL*
letter
,
he
felt
that
he
had
been
forgiven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
there
came
a
knock
to
the
door
,
and
he
heard
Lord
Henry
's
*NL*
voice
outside
.
``
My
dear
boy
,
I
must
see
you
.
Let
me
in
at
once
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
bear
your
shutting
yourself
up
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
answer
at
first
,
but
remained
quite
still
.
The
knocking
*NL*
still
continued
and
grew
louder
.
Yes
,
it
was
better
to
let
Lord
Henry
*NL*
in
,
and
to
explain
to
him
the
new
life
he
was
going
to
lead
,
to
quarrel
*NL*
with
him
if
it
became
necessary
to
quarrel
,
to
part
if
parting
was
*NL*
inevitable
.
He
jumped
up
,
drew
the
screen
hastily
across
the
picture
,
*NL*
and
unlocked
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
sorry
for
it
all
,
Dorian
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
as
he
entered
.
*NL*
``
But
you
must
not
think
too
much
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
about
Sibyl
Vane
?
''
asked
the
lad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
''
answered
Lord
Henry
,
sinking
into
a
chair
and
slowly
*NL*
pulling
off
his
yellow
gloves
.
``
It
is
dreadful
,
from
one
point
of
*NL*
view
,
but
it
was
not
your
fault
.
Tell
me
,
did
you
go
behind
and
see
*NL*
her
,
after
the
play
was
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
sure
you
had
.
Did
you
make
a
scene
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
brutal
,
Harry
--
perfectly
brutal
.
But
it
is
all
right
now
.
I
am
*NL*
not
sorry
for
anything
that
has
happened
.
It
has
taught
me
to
know
*NL*
myself
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Dorian
,
I
am
so
glad
you
take
it
in
that
way
!
I
was
afraid
I
*NL*
would
find
you
plunged
in
remorse
and
tearing
that
nice
curly
hair
of
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
got
through
all
that
,
''
said
Dorian
,
shaking
his
head
and
*NL*
smiling
.
``
I
am
perfectly
happy
now
.
I
know
what
conscience
is
,
to
*NL*
begin
with
.
It
is
not
what
you
told
me
it
was
.
It
is
the
divinest
*NL*
thing
in
us
.
Do
n't
sneer
at
it
,
Harry
,
any
more
--
at
least
not
before
*NL*
me
.
I
want
to
be
good
.
I
ca
n't
bear
the
idea
of
my
soul
being
*NL*
hideous

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
charming
artistic
basis
for
ethics

Dorian
!
I
congratulate
you
*NL*
on
it
.
But
how
are
you
going
to
begin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
marrying
Sibyl
Vane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marrying
Sibyl
Vane
!
''
cried
Lord
Henry
,
standing
up
and
looking
at
him
*NL*
in
perplexed
amazement
.
``
But
,
my
dear
Dorian
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Harry
,
I
know
what
you
are
going
to
say

Something
dreadful

about
marriage

Do
n't
say
it
.
Do
n't
ever
say
things
of
that
kind
to
*NL*
me
again

Two
days
ago
I
asked
Sibyl
to
marry
me

I
am
not
going

break
my
word

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

Did
n't
you
get
my
letter

morning

*NL*
``

was
afraid

``

*NL*
*NL*
Lord

walked
across
the
room
,
and
sitting
down
by
Dorian
Gray
,
*NL*
took
both
his
hands
in
his
own
and
held
them
tightly
.
``

he

said
,
``
my

*NL*
*NL*
A
cry
of
pain
broke
from
the
lad
's
lips
,
and
he
leaped
to
his
feet
,
*NL*
tearing
his
hands
away
from
Lord
Henry
's
grasp
.
``
Dead
!
Sibyl
dead
!
*NL*
It

not
true

It

a
horrible
lie
!
How
dare
you
say
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
true
,
Dorian
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
gravely
.
``
It
is
in
all
*NL*
the
morning
papers
.
I
wrote
down
to
you
to
ask
you
not
to
see
any
one
*NL*
till
I
came
.
There
will
have
to
be
an
inquest
,
of
course
,
and
you
must
*NL*
not
be
mixed
up
in
it
.
Things
like
that
make
a
man
fashionable
in
*NL*
Paris
.
But
in
London
people
are
so
prejudiced
.
Here
,
one
should
never
*NL*
make
one
's
_
debut
_
with
a
scandal
.
One
should
reserve
that
to
give
an
*NL*
interest
to
one
's
old
age

I
suppose
they
do
n't
know
your
name
at
the
*NL*
theatre
?
If
they
do
n't
,
it
is
all
right

Did
any
one
see
you
going
*NL*
round
to
her
room

That
is
an
important
point

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
did
not
answer
for
a
few
moments
.
He
was
dazed
with
horror
.
*NL*
Finally
he
stammered
,
in
a
stifled
voice
,
``
Harry
,
did
you
say
an
*NL*
inquest
?
What
did
you
mean
by
that
?
Did
Sibyl

Oh
,
Harry
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
bear
it

But
be
quick
.
Tell
me
everything
at
once

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
it
was
not
an
accident
,
Dorian
,
though
it
must
be
put
*NL*
in
that
way
to
the
public
.
It
seems
that
as
she
was
leaving
the
*NL*
theatre
with
her
mother
,
about
half-past
twelve
or
so
,
she
said
she
had
*NL*
forgotten
something
upstairs
.
They
waited
some
time
for
her
,
but
she
*NL*
did
not
come
down
again
.
They
ultimately
found
her
lying
dead
on
the
*NL*
floor
of
her
dressing-room
.
She
had
swallowed
something
by
mistake
,
*NL*
some
dreadful
thing
they
use
at
theatres
.
I
do
n't
know
what
it
was
,
*NL*
but
it
had
either
prussic
acid
or
white
lead
in
it
.
I
should
fancy
it
*NL*
was
prussic
acid
,
as
she
seems
to
have
died
instantaneously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harry
,
Harry
,
it
is
terrible
!
''
cried
the
lad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
is
very
tragic
,
of
course
,
but
you
must
not
get
yourself
mixed
*NL*
up
in
it
.
I
see
by
_
The
Standard
_
that
she
was
seventeen
.
I
should
have
*NL*
thought
she
was
almost
younger
than
that
.
She
looked
such
a
child
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
know
so
little
about
acting
.
Dorian
,
you
must
n't
let
this
*NL*
thing
get
on
your
nerves
.
You
must
come
and
dine
with
me
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
we
will
look
in
at
the
opera
.
It
is
a
Patti
night
,
and
*NL*
everybody
will
be
there
.
You
can
come
to
my
sister
's
box
.
She
has
got
*NL*
some
smart
women
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
have
murdered
Sibyl
Vane
,
''
said
Dorian
Gray
,
half
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
murdered
her
as
surely
as
if
I
had
cut
her
little
throat
with
a
knife
.
*NL*
Yet
the
roses
are
not
less
lovely
for
all
that
.
The
birds
sing
just
as
*NL*
happily
in
my
garden
.
And
to-night
I
am
to
dine
with
you
,
and
then
go
*NL*
on
to
the
opera
,
and
sup
somewhere
,
I
suppose
,
afterwards
.
How
*NL*
extraordinarily
dramatic
life
is
!
If
I
had
read
all
this
in
a
book
,
*NL*
Harry
,
I
think
I
would
have
wept
over
it
.
Somehow
,
now
that
it
has
*NL*
happened
actually
,
and
to
me
,
it
seems
far
too
wonderful
for
tears
.
*NL*
Here
is
the
first
passionate
love-letter
I
have
ever
written
in
my
*NL*
life
.
Strange
,
that
my
first
passionate
love-letter
should
have
been
*NL*
addressed
to
a
dead
girl
.
Can
they
feel
,
I
wonder
,
those
white
silent
*NL*
people
we
call
the
dead
?
Sibyl
!
Can
she
feel
,
or
know
,
or
listen
?
*NL*
Oh
,
Harry
,
how
I
loved
her
once
!
It
seems
years
ago
to
me
now
.
She
*NL*
was
everything
to
me
.
Then
came
that
dreadful
night
--
was
it
really
*NL*
only
last
night
?
--
when
she
played
so
badly
,
and
my
heart
almost
broke
.
*NL*
She
explained
it
all
to
me
.
It
was
terribly
pathetic
.
But
I
was
not
*NL*
moved
a
bit
.
I
thought
her
shallow
.
Suddenly
something
happened
that
*NL*
made
me
afraid
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
it
was
,
but
it
was
terrible
.
I
*NL*
said
I
would
go
back
to
her
.
I
felt
I
had
done
wrong
.
And
now
she
is
*NL*
dead
.
My
God
!
My
God
!
Harry
,
what
shall
I
do
?
You
do
n't
know
the
*NL*
danger
I
am
in
,
and
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
straight
.
She
would
*NL*
have
done
that
for
me
.
She
had
no
right
to
kill
herself
.
It
was
*NL*
selfish
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Dorian
,
''
answered
Lord
Henry
,
taking
a
cigarette
from
his
case
*NL*
and
producing
a
gold-latten
matchbox
,
``
the
only
way
a
woman
can
ever
*NL*
reform
a
man
is
by
boring
him
so
completely
that
he
loses
all
possible
*NL*
interest
in
life
.
If
you
had
married
this
girl
,
you
would
have
been
*NL*
wretched
.
Of
course
,
you
would
have
treated
her
kindly
.
One
can
*NL*
always
be
kind
to
people
about
whom
one
cares
nothing
.
But
she
would
*NL*
have
soon
found
out
that
you
were
absolutely
indifferent
to
her
.
And
*NL*
when
a
woman
finds
that
out
about
her
husband
,
she
either
becomes
*NL*
dreadfully
dowdy
,
or
wears
very
smart
bonnets
that
some
other
woman
's
*NL*
husband
has
to
pay
for
.
I
say
nothing
about
the
social
mistake
,
which
*NL*
would
have
been
abject
--
which
,
of
course
,
I
would
not
have
allowed
--
but
*NL*
I
assure
you
that
in
any
case
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
an
*NL*
absolute
failure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
would
,
''
muttered
the
lad
,
walking
up
and
down
the
room
*NL*
and
looking
horribly
pale
.
``
But
I
thought
it
was
my
duty
.
It
is
not
*NL*
my
fault
that
this
terrible
tragedy
has
prevented
my
doing
what
was
*NL*
right
.
I
remember
your
saying
once
that
there
is
a
fatality
about
good
*NL*
resolutions
--
that
they
are
always
made
too
late
.
Mine
certainly
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
resolutions
are
useless
attempts
to
interfere
with
scientific
*NL*
laws
.
Their
origin
is
pure
vanity
.
Their
result
is
absolutely
_
nil
_
.
*NL*
They
give
us
,
now
and
then
,
some
of
those
luxurious
sterile
emotions
*NL*
that
have
a
certain
charm
for
the
weak
.
That
is
all
that
can
be
said
*NL*
for
them
.
They
are
simply
cheques
that
men
draw
on
a
bank
where
they
*NL*
have
no
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harry
,
''
cried
Dorian
Gray
,
coming
over
and
sitting
down
beside
him
,
*NL*
``
why
is
it
that
I
can
not
feel
this
tragedy
as
much
as
I
want
to
?
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
I
am
heartless
.
Do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
done
too
many
foolish
things
during
the
last
fortnight
to
be
*NL*
entitled
to
give
yourself
that
name
,
Dorian
,
''
answered
Lord
Henry
with
*NL*
his
sweet
melancholy
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
frowned
.
``
I
do
n't
like
that
explanation
,
Harry
,
''
he
rejoined
,
*NL*
``
but
I
am
glad
you
do
n't
think
I
am
heartless
.
I
am
nothing
of
the
*NL*
kind
.
I
know
I
am
not
.
And
yet
I
must
admit
that
this
thing
that
has
*NL*
happened
does
not
affect
me
as
it
should
.
It
seems
to
me
to
be
simply
*NL*
like
a
wonderful
ending
to
a
wonderful
play
.
It
has
all
the
terrible
*NL*
beauty
of
a
Greek
tragedy
,
a
tragedy
in
which
I
took
a
great
part
,
but
*NL*
by
which
I
have
not
been
wounded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
an
interesting
question
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
who
found
an
*NL*
exquisite
pleasure
in
playing
on
the
lad
's
unconscious
egotism
,
``
an
*NL*
extremely
interesting
question
.
I
fancy
that
the
true
explanation
is
*NL*
this
:
It
often
happens
that
the
real
tragedies
of
life
occur
in
such
*NL*
an
inartistic
manner
that
they
hurt
us
by
their
crude
violence
,
their
*NL*
absolute
incoherence
,
their
absurd
want
of
meaning
,
their
entire
lack
*NL*
of
style
.
They
affect
us
just
as
vulgarity
affects
us
.
They
give
us
*NL*
an
impression
of
sheer
brute
force
,
and
we
revolt
against
that
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
however
,
a
tragedy
that
possesses
artistic
elements
of
*NL*
beauty
crosses
our
lives
.
If
these
elements
of
beauty
are
real
,
the
*NL*
whole
thing
simply
appeals
to
our
sense
of
dramatic
effect
.
Suddenly
*NL*
we
find
that
we
are
no
longer
the
actors
,
but
the
spectators
of
the
*NL*
play
.
Or
rather
we
are
both
.
We
watch
ourselves
,
and
the
mere
wonder
*NL*
of
the
spectacle
enthralls
us
.
In
the
present
case
,
what
is
it
that
*NL*
has
really
happened
?
Some
one
has
killed
herself
for
love
of
you
.
I
*NL*
wish
that
I
had
ever
had
such
an
experience
.
It
would
have
made
me
in
*NL*
love
with
love
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
The
people
who
have
adored
*NL*
me
--
there
have
not
been
very
many
,
but
there
have
been
some
--
have
*NL*
always
insisted
on
living
on
,
long
after
I
had
ceased
to
care
for
them
,
*NL*
or
they
to
care
for
me
.
They
have
become
stout
and
tedious
,
and
when
I
*NL*
meet
them
,
they
go
in
at
once
for
reminiscences
.
That
awful
memory
of
*NL*
woman
!
What
a
fearful
thing
it
is
!
And
what
an
utter
intellectual
*NL*
stagnation
it
reveals
!
One
should
absorb
the
colour
of
life
,
but
one
*NL*
should
never
remember
its
details
.
Details
are
always
vulgar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
sow
poppies
in
my
garden
,
''
sighed
Dorian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
necessity
,
''
rejoined
his
companion
.
``
Life
has
always
*NL*
poppies
in
her
hands
.
Of
course
,
now
and
then
things
linger
.
I
once
*NL*
wore
nothing
but
violets
all
through
one
season
,
as
a
form
of
artistic
*NL*
mourning
for
a
romance
that
would
not
die
.
Ultimately
,
however
,
it
did
*NL*
die
.
I
forget
what
killed
it
.
I
think
it
was
her
proposing
to
*NL*
sacrifice
the
whole
world
for
me
.
That
is
always
a
dreadful
moment
.
*NL*
It
fills
one
with
the
terror
of
eternity
.
Well
--
would
you
believe
*NL*
it
?
--
a
week
ago
,
at
Lady
Hampshire
's
,
I
found
myself
seated
at
dinner
*NL*
next
the
lady
in
question
,
and
she
insisted
on
going
over
the
whole
*NL*
thing
again
,
and
digging
up
the
past
,
and
raking
up
the
future
.
I
had
*NL*
buried
my
romance
in
a
bed
of
asphodel
.
She
dragged
it
out
again
and
*NL*
assured
me
that
I
had
spoiled
her
life
.
I
am
bound
to
state
that
she
*NL*
ate
an
enormous
dinner
,
so
I
did
not
feel
any
anxiety
.
But
what
a
lack
*NL*
of
taste
she
showed
!
The
one
charm
of
the
past
is
that
it
is
the
past
.
*NL*
But
women
never
know
when
the
curtain
has
fallen
.
They
always
want
a
*NL*
sixth
act
,
and
as
soon
as
the
interest
of
the
play
is
entirely
over
,
*NL*
they
propose
to
continue
it
.
If
they
were
allowed
their
own
way
,
every
*NL*
comedy
would
have
a
tragic
ending
,
and
every
tragedy
would
culminate
in
*NL*
a
farce
.
They
are
charmingly
artificial
,
but
they
have
no
sense
of
*NL*
art
.
You
are
more
fortunate
than
I
am
.
I
assure
you
,
Dorian
,
that
not
*NL*
one
of
the
women
I
have
known
would
have
done
for
me
what
Sibyl
Vane
*NL*
did
for
you
.
Ordinary
women
always
console
themselves
.
Some
of
them
*NL*
do
it
by
going
in
for
sentimental
colours
.
Never
trust
a
woman
who
*NL*
wears
mauve
,
whatever
her
age
may
be
,
or
a
woman
over
thirty-five
who
*NL*
is
fond
of
pink
ribbons
.
It
always
means
that
they
have
a
history
.
*NL*
Others
find
a
great
consolation
in
suddenly
discovering
the
good
*NL*
qualities
of
their
husbands
.
They
flaunt
their
conjugal
felicity
in
*NL*
one
's
face
,
as
if
it
were
the
most
fascinating
of
sins
.
Religion
*NL*
consoles
some
.
Its
mysteries
have
all
the
charm
of
a
flirtation
,
a
*NL*
woman
once
told
me
,
and
I
can
quite
understand
it
.
Besides
,
nothing
*NL*
makes
one
so
vain
as
being
told
that
one
is
a
sinner
.
Conscience
makes
*NL*
egotists
of
us
all
.
Yes
;
there
is
really
no
end
to
the
consolations
*NL*
that
women
find
in
modern
life
.
Indeed
,
I
have
not
mentioned
the
most
*NL*
important
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
,
Harry
?
''
said
the
lad
listlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
obvious
consolation

In
good
society

always
whitewashes

*NL*
really
,
Dorian

how
different
Sibyl
Vane
must
have
been
from
all
the
*NL*
women

is
something
to
me
quite
beautiful
about
her
*NL*
death

I
am
glad
I
am
living
in
a
century
when
such
wonders
happen

make
one
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
things
we
all
play
with
,
*NL*
such
as
romance
,
passion
,
and
love

I
am
afraid

women
appreciate
cruelty

downright
cruelty

more

than
anything
else

They
have
wonderfully
primitive
instincts

We
*NL*
have
emancipated
them
,
but
they
remain
slaves
looking
for
their
*NL*
masters

all
the

They
love
being
dominated

I
am
sure
you

never

absolutely
angry

delightful

looked

after
all

you
said
something
to

me
the
day
before
yesterday

seemed
to
me
at
the
time
to
be
merely

fanciful

I

absolutely
true

it
holds
the
key

to
everything

``
What
was

the
heroines
of

romance

that
she
was
Desdemona
one
night
,
and
Ophelia
the
other

that
*NL*
if
she
died
as
Juliet

she
came
to
life
as
Imogen

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
never

muttered
the
lad
,
burying
his
*NL*
face
in
his
hands

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

she
will
never
come

She
has
played

last

But
*NL*
you
must
think
of
that
lonely
death
in
the
tawdry
dressing-room
simply
*NL*
as
a
strange
lurid
fragment
from
some
Jacobean
tragedy
,
as
a
wonderful
*NL*
scene
from
Webster

or
Ford
,
or
Cyril
Tourneur

The
girl
never
really

lived

and
so
she
has
never
really
died

To
you
at
least
she
was
*NL*
always
a
dream
,
a
phantom
that
flitted
through
Shakespeare
's
plays
and
*NL*
left
them
lovelier
for
its
presence
,
a
reed
through
which
Shakespeare
's
*NL*

sounded
richer
and
more
full
of
joy

The
moment
she
touched

actual

she
marred

and
it
marred
her

so
she
passed
away

Ophelia

you
like

Put
ashes
on
your
head

*NL*
Cordelia
was
strangled

Cry
out
against
Heaven
because
the
daughter
of
*NL*
Brabantio
died
.
But
do
n't
waste
your
tears
over
Sibyl
Vane
.
She
was
*NL*
less
real
than
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
.
The
evening
darkened
in
the
room
.
Noiselessly
,
*NL*
and
with
silver
feet
,
the
shadows
crept
in
from
the
garden
.
The
*NL*
colours
faded
wearily
out
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
time
Dorian
Gray
looked
up
.
``
You
have
explained
me
to
*NL*
myself
,
Harry
,
''
he
murmured
with
something
of
a
sigh
of
relief
.
``
I
*NL*
felt
all
that
you
have
said
,
but
somehow
I
was
afraid
of
it
,
and
I
*NL*
could
not
express
it
to
myself
.
How
well
you
know
me
!
But
we
will
not
*NL*
talk
again
of
what
has
happened
.
It
has
been
a
marvellous
experience
.
*NL*
That
is
all
.
I
wonder
if
life
has
still
in
store
for
me
anything
as
*NL*
marvellous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Life
has
everything
in
store
for
you
,
Dorian
.
There
is
nothing
that
*NL*
you
,
with
your
extraordinary
good
looks
,
will
not
be
able
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
suppose
,
Harry
,
I
became
haggard
,
and
old
,
and
wrinkled
?
What
*NL*
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
rising
to
go
,
``
then
,
my
dear
Dorian
,
you
*NL*
would
have
to
fight
for
your
victories
.
As
it
is
,
they
are
brought
to
*NL*
you
.
No
,
you
must
keep
your
good
looks
.
We
live
in
an
age
that
reads
*NL*
too
much
to
be
wise
,
and
that
thinks
too
much
to
be
beautiful
.
We
*NL*
can
not
spare
you
.
And
now
you
had
better
dress
and
drive
down
to
the
*NL*
club

We
are
rather
late
,
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
shall
join
you
at
the
opera

Harry

I
feel
too
tired
to
eat
*NL*
anything

What
is
the
number
of
your
sister
's
box
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-seven

I
believe
.
It
is

the
grand
tier

will
see
her

the
door

But
I
am
sorry
you
wo
n't
come
and
dine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
feel
up
to
it
,
''
said
Dorian
listlessly
.
``
But
I
am
awfully
*NL*
obliged
to
you
for
all
that
you
have
said
to
me
.
You
are
certainly
my
*NL*
best
friend

No
one
has
ever
understood
me
as
you
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
only
at
the
beginning
of
our
friendship
,
Dorian
,
''
answered
Lord
*NL*
Henry
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
.
``
Good-bye
.
I
shall
see
you
before
*NL*
nine-thirty
,
I
hope
.
Remember
,
Patti
is
singing

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
,
Dorian
Gray
touched
the
bell
,
and
in
*NL*
a
few
minutes
Victor
appeared
with
the
lamps
and
drew
the
blinds
down
.
*NL*
He
waited
impatiently
for
him
to
go
.
The
man
seemed
to
take
an
*NL*
interminable
time
over
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
had
left
,
he
rushed
to
the
screen
and
drew
it
back
.
No
;
*NL*
there
was
no
further
change
in
the
picture
.
It
had
received
the
news
*NL*
of
Sibyl
Vane
's
death
before
he
had
known
of
it
himself
.
It
was
*NL*
conscious
of
the
events
of
life
as
they
occurred
.
The
vicious
cruelty
*NL*
that
marred
the
fine
lines
of
the
mouth
had
,
no
doubt
,
appeared
at
the
*NL*
very
moment
that
the
girl
had
drunk
the
poison
,
whatever
it
was
.
Or
*NL*
was
it
indifferent
to
results
?
Did
it
merely
take
cognizance
of
what
*NL*
passed
within
the
soul
?
He
wondered
,
and
hoped
that
some
day
he
would
*NL*
see
the
change
taking
place
before
his
very
eyes
,
shuddering
as
he
*NL*
hoped
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Sibyl
!
What
a
romance
it
had
all
been
!
She
had
often
mimicked
*NL*
death
on
the
stage
.
Then
Death
himself
had
touched
her
and
taken
her
*NL*
with
him
.
How
had
she
played
that
dreadful
last
scene
?
Had
she
cursed
*NL*
him
,
as
she
died
?
No
;
she
had
died
for
love
of
him
,
and
love
would
*NL*
always
be
a
sacrament
to
him
now
.
She
had
atoned
for
everything
by
the
*NL*
sacrifice
she
had
made
of
her
life
.
He
would
not
think
any
more
of
*NL*
what
she
had
made
him
go
through
,
on
that
horrible
night
at
the
*NL*
theatre
.
When
he
thought
of
her
,
it
would
be
as
a
wonderful
tragic
*NL*
figure
sent
on
to
the
world
's
stage
to
show
the
supreme
reality
of
*NL*
love
.
A
wonderful
tragic
figure
?
Tears
came
to
his
eyes
as
he
*NL*
remembered
her
childlike
look
,
and
winsome
fanciful
ways
,
and
shy
*NL*
tremulous
grace
.
He
brushed
them
away
hastily
and
looked
again
at
the
*NL*
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
the
time
had
really
come
for
making
his
choice
.
Or
had
*NL*
his
choice
already
been
made
?
Yes
,
life
had
decided
that
for
*NL*
him
--
life
,
and
his
own
infinite
curiosity
about
life
.
Eternal
youth
,
*NL*
infinite
passion
,
pleasures
subtle
and
secret
,
wild
joys
and
wilder
*NL*
sins
--
he
was
to
have
all
these
things
.
The
portrait
was
to
bear
the
*NL*
burden
of
his
shame
:
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
feeling
of
pain
crept
over
him
as
he
thought
of
the
desecration
that
*NL*
was
in
store
for
the
fair
face
on
the
canvas
.
Once
,
in
boyish
mockery
*NL*
of
Narcissus
,
he
had
kissed
,
or
feigned
to
kiss
,
those
painted
lips
*NL*
that
now
smiled
so
cruelly
at
him
.
Morning
after
morning
he
had
sat
*NL*
before
the
portrait
wondering
at
its
beauty
,
almost
enamoured
of
it
,
as
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
at
times
.
Was
it
to
alter
now
with
every
mood
to
*NL*
which
he
yielded
?
Was
it
to
become
a
monstrous
and
loathsome
thing
,
to
*NL*
be
hidden
away
in
a
locked
room
,
to
be
shut
out
from
the
sunlight
that
*NL*
had
so
often
touched
to
brighter
gold
the
waving
wonder
of
its
hair
?
*NL*
The
pity
of
it
!
the
pity
of
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
,
he
thought
of
praying
that
the
horrible
sympathy
that
*NL*
existed
between
him
and
the
picture
might
cease
.
It
had
changed
in
*NL*
answer
to
a
prayer
;
perhaps
in
answer
to
a
prayer
it
might
remain
*NL*
unchanged
.
And
yet
,
who
,
that
knew
anything
about
life
,
would
*NL*
surrender
the
chance
of
remaining
always
young
,
however
fantastic
that
*NL*
chance
might
be
,
or
with
what
fateful
consequences
it
might
be
fraught
?
*NL*
Besides
,
was
it
really
under
his
control
?
Had
it
indeed
been
prayer
*NL*
that
had
produced
the
substitution
?
Might
there
not
be
some
curious
*NL*
scientific
reason
for
it
all
?
If
thought
could
exercise
its
influence
*NL*
upon
a
living
organism
,
might
not
thought
exercise
an
influence
upon
*NL*
dead
and
inorganic
things
?
Nay
,
without
thought
or
conscious
desire
,
*NL*
might
not
things
external
to
ourselves
vibrate
in
unison
with
our
moods
*NL*
and
passions
,
atom
calling
to
atom
in
secret
love
or
strange
affinity
?
*NL*
But
the
reason
was
of
no
importance
.
He
would
never
again
tempt
by
a
*NL*
prayer
any
terrible
power
.
If
the
picture
was
to
alter
,
it
was
to
*NL*
alter
.
That
was
all
.
Why
inquire
too
closely
into
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
there
would
be
a
real
pleasure
in
watching
it
.
He
would
be
able
to
*NL*
follow
his
mind
into
its
secret
places
.
This
portrait
would
be
to
him
*NL*
the
most
magical
of
mirrors
.
As
it
had
revealed
to
him
his
own
body
,
*NL*
so
it
would
reveal
to
him
his
own
soul
.
And
when
winter
came
upon
it
,
*NL*
he
would
still
be
standing
where
spring
trembles
on
the
verge
of
*NL*
summer
.
When
the
blood
crept
from
its
face
,
and
left
behind
a
pallid
*NL*
mask
of
chalk
with
leaden
eyes
,
he
would
keep
the
glamour
of
boyhood
.
*NL*
Not
one
blossom
of
his
loveliness
would
ever
fade
.
Not
one
pulse
of
*NL*
his
life
would
ever
weaken
.
Like
the
gods
of
the
Greeks
,
he
would
be
*NL*
strong
,
and
fleet
,
and
joyous
.
What
did
it
matter
what
happened
to
the
*NL*
coloured
image
on
the
canvas
?
He
would
be
safe
.
That
was
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
the
screen
back
into
its
former
place
in
front
of
the
picture
,
*NL*
smiling
as
he
did
so
,
and
passed
into
his
bedroom
,
where
his
valet
was
*NL*
already
waiting
for
him
.
An
hour
later
he
was
at
the
opera
,
and
Lord
*NL*
Henry
was
leaning
over
his
chair
.

CHAPTER
9
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
sitting
at
breakfast
next
morning
,
Basil
Hallward
was
shown
*NL*
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
I
have
found
you
,
Dorian
,
''
he
said
gravely
.
``
I
called
*NL*
last
night
,
and
they
told
me
you
were
at
the
opera
.
Of
course
,
I
knew
*NL*
that
was
impossible
.
But
I
wish
you
had
left
word
where
you
had
really
*NL*
gone
to
.
I
passed
a
dreadful
evening
,
half
afraid
that
one
tragedy
*NL*
might
be
followed
by
another
.
I
think
you
might
have
telegraphed
for
*NL*
me
when
you
heard
of
it
first
.
I
read
of
it
quite
by
chance
in
a
late
*NL*
edition
of
_
The
Globe
_
that
I
picked
up
at
the
club
.
I
came
here
at
once
*NL*
and
was
miserable
at
not
finding
you
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
*NL*
heart-broken
I
am
about
the
whole
thing
.
I
know
what
you
must
suffer
.
*NL*
But
where
were
you
?
Did
you
go
down
and
see
the
girl
's
mother
?
For
a
*NL*
moment
I
thought
of
following
you
there
.
They
gave
the
address
in
the
*NL*
paper
.
Somewhere
in
the
Euston
Road
,
is
n't
it
?
But
I
was
afraid
of
*NL*
intruding
upon
a
sorrow
that
I
could
not
lighten
.
Poor
woman
!
What
a
*NL*
state
she
must
be
in
!
And
her
only
child
,
too
!
What
did
she
say
about
*NL*
it
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Basil
,
how
do
I
know
?
''
murmured
Dorian
Gray
,
sipping
some
*NL*
pale-yellow
wine
from
a
delicate
,
gold-beaded
bubble
of
Venetian
glass
*NL*
and
looking
dreadfully
bored
.
``
I
was
at
the
opera
.
You
should
have
*NL*
come
on
there
.
I
met
Lady
Gwendolen
,
Harry
's
sister
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
We
were
in
her
box
.
She
is
perfectly
charming
;
and
Patti
sang
*NL*
divinely
.
Do
n't
talk
about
horrid
subjects
.
If
one
does
n't
talk
about
*NL*
a
thing
,
it
has
never
happened
.
It
is
simply
expression
,
as
Harry
*NL*
says
,
that
gives
reality
to
things
.
I
may
mention
that
she
was
not
the
*NL*
woman
's
only
child
.
There
is
a
son
,
a
charming
fellow
,
I
believe
.
But
*NL*
he
is
not
on
the
stage
.
He
is
a
sailor
,
or
something
.
And
now
,
tell
*NL*
me
about
yourself
and
what
you
are
painting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
went
to
the
opera
?
''
said
Hallward
,
speaking
very
slowly
and
with
a
*NL*
strained
touch
of
pain
in
his
voice
.
``
You
went
to
the
opera
while
*NL*
Sibyl
Vane
was
lying
dead
in
some
sordid
lodging
?
You
can
talk
to
me
*NL*
of
other
women
being
charming
,
and
of
Patti
singing
divinely
,
before
*NL*
the
girl
you
loved
has
even
the
quiet
of
a
grave
to
sleep
in
?
Why
,
*NL*
man
,
there
are
horrors
in
store
for
that
little
white
body
of
hers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
Basil
!
I
wo
n't
hear
it
!
''
cried
Dorian
,
leaping
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
``
You
must
not
tell
me
about
things
.
What
is
done
is
done
.
What
is
*NL*
past
is
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
call
yesterday
the
past
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
the
actual
lapse
of
time
got
to
do
with
it
?
It
is
only
*NL*
shallow
people
who
require
years
to
get
rid
of
an
emotion
.
A
man
who
*NL*
is
master
of
himself
can
end
a
sorrow
as
easily
as
he
can
invent
a
*NL*
pleasure
.
I
do
n't
want
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
my
emotions
.
I
want
to
*NL*
use
them
,
to
enjoy
them
,
and
to
dominate
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
,
this
is
horrible
!
Something
has
changed
you
completely
.
You
*NL*
look
exactly
the
same
wonderful
boy
who
,
day
after
day
,
used
to
come
*NL*
down
to
my
studio
to
sit
for
his
picture
.
But
you
were
simple
,
*NL*
natural
,
and
affectionate
then
.
You
were
the
most
unspoiled
creature
*NL*
in
the
whole
world
.
Now
,
I
do
n't
know
what
has
come
over
you
.
You
*NL*
talk
as
if
you
had
no
heart
,
no
pity
in
you
.
It
is
all
Harry
's
*NL*
influence
.
I
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
flushed
up
and
,
going
to
the
window
,
looked
out
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
on
the
green
,
flickering
,
sun-lashed
garden
.
``
I
owe
a
great
*NL*
deal
to
Harry

Basil

he
said
at
last
,
``
more
than
I
owe
to
you

You
*NL*
only
taught
me
to
be
vain

``
Well

am
punished

that

be

turning
round

the
artist
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Basil
,
''
said
the
lad
,
going
over
to
him
and
putting
his
hand
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
``
you
have
come
too
late
.
Yesterday
,
when
I
heard
that
Sibyl
*NL*
Vane
had
killed
herself
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Killed
herself
!
Good
heavens
!
is
there
no
doubt
about
that
?
''
cried
*NL*
Hallward
,
looking
up
at
him
with
an
expression
of
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Basil
!
Surely
you
do
n't
think
it
was
a
vulgar
accident
?
Of
*NL*
course
she
killed
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
man
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
.
``
How
fearful
,
''
he
*NL*
muttered
,
and
a
shudder
ran
through
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Dorian
Gray
,
``
there
is
nothing
fearful
about
it
.
It
is
one
*NL*
of
the
great
romantic
tragedies
of
the
age
.
As
a
rule
,
people
who
act
*NL*
lead
the
most
commonplace
lives
.
They
are
good
husbands
,
or
faithful
*NL*
wives
,
or
something
tedious
.
You
know
what
I
mean
--
middle-class
virtue
*NL*
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
How
different
Sibyl
was
!
She
lived
her
*NL*
finest
tragedy
.
She
was
always
a
heroine
.
The
last
night
she
*NL*
played
--
the
night
you
saw
her
--
she
acted
badly
because
she
had
known
*NL*
the
reality
of
love
.
When
she
knew
its
unreality
,
she
died
,
as
Juliet
*NL*
might
have
died
.
She
passed
again
into
the
sphere
of
art
.
There
is
*NL*
something
of
the
martyr
about
her
.
Her
death
has
all
the
pathetic
*NL*
uselessness
of
martyrdom
,
all
its
wasted
beauty
.
But
,
as
I
was
saying
,
*NL*
you
must
not
think
I
have
not
suffered
.
If
you
had
come
in
yesterday
*NL*
at
a
particular
moment
--
about
half-past
five
,
perhaps
,
or
a
quarter
to
*NL*
six
--
you
would
have
found
me
in
tears
.
Even
Harry
,
who
was
here
,
who
*NL*
brought
me
the
news
,
in
fact
,
had
no
idea
what
I
was
going
through
.
I
*NL*
suffered
immensely
.
Then
it
passed
away
.
I
can
not
repeat
an
emotion
.
*NL*
No
one
can
,
except
sentimentalists
.
And
you
are
awfully
unjust
,
Basil
.
*NL*
You
come
down
here
to
console
me
.
That
is
charming
of
you
.
You
find
*NL*
me
consoled
,
and
you
are
furious
.
How
like
a
sympathetic
person
!
You
*NL*
remind
me
of
a
story
Harry
told
me
about
a
certain
philanthropist
who
*NL*
spent
twenty
years
of
his
life
in
trying
to
get
some
grievance
*NL*
redressed
,
or
some
unjust
law
altered
--
I
forget
exactly
what
it
was
.
*NL*
Finally
he
succeeded
,
and
nothing
could
exceed
his
disappointment
.
He
*NL*
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
,
almost
died
of
_
ennui
_
,
and
became
a
*NL*
confirmed
misanthrope
.
And
besides
,
my
dear
old
Basil
,
if
you
really
*NL*
want
to
console
me
,
teach
me
rather
to
forget
what
has
happened
,
or
to
*NL*
see
it
from
a
proper
artistic
point
of
view
.
Was
it
not
Gautier
who
*NL*
used
to
write
about
_
la
consolation
des
arts
_
?
I
remember
picking
up
a
*NL*
little
vellum-covered
book
in
your
studio
one
day
and
chancing
on
that
*NL*
delightful
phrase
.
Well
,
I
am
not
like
that
young
man
you
told
me
of
*NL*
when
we
were
down
at
Marlow
together
,
the
young
man
who
used
to
say
*NL*
that
yellow
satin
could
console
one
for
all
the
miseries
of
life
.
I
*NL*
love
beautiful
things
that
one
can
touch
and
handle
.
Old
brocades
,
*NL*
green
bronzes
,
lacquer-work
,
carved
ivories
,
exquisite
surroundings
,
*NL*
luxury
,
pomp
--
there
is
much
to
be
got
from
all
these
.
But
the
artistic
*NL*
temperament
that
they
create
,
or
at
any
rate
reveal
,
is
still
more
to
*NL*
me
.
To
become
the
spectator
of
one
's
own
life
,
as
Harry
says
,
is
to
*NL*
escape
the
suffering
of
life
.
I
know
you
are
surprised
at
my
talking
*NL*
to
you
like
this
.
You
have
not
realized
how
I
have
developed
.
I
was
a
*NL*
schoolboy
when
you
knew
me
.
I
am
a
man
now
.
I
have
new
passions
,
new
*NL*
thoughts
,
new
ideas
.
I
am
different
,
but
you
must
not
like
me
less
.
I
*NL*
am
changed
,
but
you
must
always
be
my
friend
.
Of
course
,
I
am
very
*NL*
fond
of
Harry
.
But
I
know
that
you
are
better
than
he
is
.
You
are
not
*NL*
stronger
--
you
are
too
much
afraid
of
life
--
but
you
are
better
.
And
how
*NL*
happy
we
used
to
be
together
!
Do
n't
leave
me
,
Basil
,
and
do
n't
quarrel
*NL*
with
me
.
I
am
what
I
am
.
There
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
felt
strangely
moved
.
The
lad
was
infinitely
dear
to
him
,
*NL*
and
his
personality
had
been
the
great
turning
point
in
his
art
.
He
*NL*
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
reproaching
him
any
more
.
After
all
,
his
*NL*
indifference
was
probably
merely
a
mood
that
would
pass
away
.
There
*NL*
was
so
much
in
him
that
was
good
,
so
much
in
him
that
was
noble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Dorian
,
''
he
said
at
length
,
with
a
sad
smile
,
``
I
wo
n't
speak
to
*NL*
you
again
about
this
horrible
thing
,
after
to-day
.
I
only
trust
your
*NL*
name
wo
n't
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
it
.
The
inquest
is
to
take
*NL*
place
this
afternoon
.
Have
they
summoned
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
shook
his
head
,
and
a
look
of
annoyance
passed
over
his
face
at
*NL*
the
mention
of
the
word
``
inquest
.
''
There
was
something
so
crude
and
*NL*
vulgar
about
everything
of
the
kind
.
``
They
do
n't
know
my
name
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
she
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
my
Christian
name
,
and
that
I
am
quite
sure
she
never
mentioned
*NL*
to
any
one
.
She
told
me
once
that
they
were
all
rather
curious
to
*NL*
learn
who
I
was
,
and
that
she
invariably
told
them
my
name
was
Prince
*NL*
Charming
.
It
was
pretty
of
her
.
You
must
do
me
a
drawing
of
Sibyl
,
*NL*
Basil
.
I
should
like
to
have
something
more
of
her
than
the
memory
of
*NL*
a
few
kisses
and
some
broken
pathetic
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
and
do
something
,
Dorian
,
if
it
would
please
you
.
But
you
*NL*
must
come
and
sit
to
me
yourself
again
.
I
ca
n't
get
on
without
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
never
sit
to
you
again
,
Basil
.
It
is
impossible
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
*NL*
starting
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
stared
at
him
.
``
My
dear
boy
,
what
nonsense
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
n't
like
what
I
did
of
you

Where
is
it

*NL*
Why
have
you
pulled
the
screen
in
front
of
it
?
Let
me
look
at
it
.
It
*NL*
is
the
best
thing
I
have
ever
done
.
Do
take
the
screen
away
,
Dorian
.
*NL*
It
is
simply
disgraceful
of
your
servant
hiding
my
work
like
that
.
I
*NL*
felt
the
room
looked
different
as
I
came
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
servant
has
nothing
to
do
with
it

Basil

You
do
n't
imagine
I
let
*NL*
him
arrange
my
room
for
me
?
He
settles
my
flowers
for
me
*NL*
sometimes
--
that
is
all
.
No
;
I
did
it
myself

The
light
was
too
strong
*NL*
on
the
portrait

*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
strong

Surely
not

my

fellow

It
is
an
admirable
place
for
*NL*
it

Let
me
see
it
.
''
And
Hallward
walked
towards
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cry
of
terror
broke
from
Dorian
Gray
's
lips
,
and
he
rushed
between
*NL*
the
painter
and
the
screen
.
``
Basil
,
''
he
said
,
looking
very
pale
,
``
you
*NL*
must
not
look
at
it
.
I
do
n't
wish
you
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
look
at
my
own
work
!
You
are
not
serious
.
Why
should
n't
I
look
*NL*
at
it
?
''
exclaimed
Hallward
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
try
to
look
at
it
,
Basil
,
on
my
word
of
honour
I
will
never
*NL*
speak
to
you
again
as
long
as
I
live

I
am
quite
serious
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
offer
any
explanation
,
and
you
are
not
to
ask
for
any
.
But
,
remember
,
*NL*
if
you
touch
this
screen
,
everything
is
over
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
was
thunderstruck
.
He
looked
at
Dorian
Gray
in
absolute
*NL*
amazement
.
He
had
never
seen
him
like
this
before
.
The
lad
was
*NL*
actually
pallid
with
rage
.
His
hands
were
clenched
,
and
the
pupils
of
*NL*
his
eyes
were
like
disks
of
blue
fire
.
He
was
trembling
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
matter
?
Of
course
I
wo
n't
look
at
it
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
want
me
to
,
''
he
said
,
rather
coldly
,
turning
on
his
heel
and
going
over
*NL*
towards
the
window
.
``
But
,
really
,
it
seems
rather
absurd
that
I
*NL*
should
n't
see
my
own
work
,
especially
as
I
am
going
to
exhibit
it
in
*NL*
Paris
in
the
autumn
.
I
shall
probably
have
to
give
it
another
coat
of
*NL*
varnish
before
that
,
so
I
must
see
it
some
day
,
and
why
not
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
exhibit
it
!
You
want
to
exhibit
it
?
''
exclaimed
Dorian
Gray
,
a
*NL*
strange
sense
of
terror
creeping
over
him
.
Was
the
world
going
to
be
*NL*
shown
his
secret
?
Were
people
to
gape
at
the
mystery
of
his
life
?
*NL*
That
was
impossible
.
Something
--
he
did
not
know
what
--
had
to
be
done
*NL*
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
do
n't
suppose
you
will
object
to
that
.
Georges
Petit
is
going
*NL*
to
collect
all
my
best
pictures
for
a
special
exhibition
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Seze
,
which
will
open
the
first
week
in
October
.
The
portrait
will
*NL*
only
be
away
a
month
.
I
should
think
you
could
easily
spare
it
for
*NL*
that
time
.
In
fact
,
you
are
sure
to
be
out
of
town
.
And
if
you
keep
*NL*
it
always
behind
a
screen
,
you
ca
n't
care
much
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
.
There
were
beads
of
*NL*
perspiration
there
.
He
felt
that
he
was
on
the
brink
of
a
horrible
*NL*
danger
.
``
You
told
me
a
month
ago
that
you
would
never
exhibit
it
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
.
``
Why
have
you
changed
your
mind
?
You
people
who
go
in
for
*NL*
being
consistent
have
just
as
many
moods
as
others
have
.
The
only
*NL*
difference
is
that
your
moods
are
rather
meaningless
.
You
ca
n't
have
*NL*
forgotten
that
you
assured
me
most
solemnly
that
nothing
in
the
world
*NL*
would
induce
you
to
send
it
to
any
exhibition
.
You
told
Harry
exactly
*NL*
the
same
thing
.
''
He
stopped
suddenly
,
and
a
gleam
of
light
came
into
*NL*
his
eyes
.
He
remembered
that
Lord
Henry
had
said
to
him
once
,
half
*NL*
seriously
and
half
in
jest
,
``
If
you
want
to
have
a
strange
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
,
get
Basil
to
tell
you
why
he
wo
n't
exhibit
your
picture
.
He
*NL*
told
me
why
he
would
n't
,
and
it
was
a
revelation
to
me
.
''
Yes
,
perhaps
*NL*
Basil
,
too
,
had
his
secret
.
He
would
ask
him
and
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Basil
,
''
he
said
,
coming
over
quite
close
and
looking
him
straight
in
*NL*
the
face
,
``
we
have
each
of
us
a
secret
.
Let
me
know
yours
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
tell
you
mine

What
was
your
reason
for
refusing
to
exhibit
my
*NL*
picture
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
shuddered
in
spite
of
himself
.
``
Dorian
,
if
I
told
you
,
you
*NL*
might
like
me
less
than
you
do
,
and
you
would
certainly
laugh
at
me
.
I
*NL*
could
not
bear
your
doing
either
of
those
two
things
.
If
you
wish
me
*NL*
never
to
look
at
your
picture
again
,
I
am
content
.
I
have
always
you
*NL*
to
look
at
.
If
you
wish
the
best
work
I
have
ever
done
to
be
hidden
*NL*
from
the
world
,
I
am
satisfied

Your
friendship
is
dearer
to
me
than
*NL*
any
fame
or
reputation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Basil
,
you
must
tell
me
,
''
insisted
Dorian
Gray
.
``
I
think
I
have
a
*NL*
right
to
know

''
His
feeling
of
terror
had
passed
away
,
and
curiosity
*NL*
had
taken
its
place
.
He
was
determined
to
find
out
Basil
Hallward
's
*NL*
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
sit
down
,
Dorian

said
the
painter
,
looking
troubled
.
``
Let
us
*NL*
sit
down

And
just
answer
me
one
question
.
Have
you
noticed
in
the
*NL*
picture
something
curious
?
--
something
that
probably
at
first
did
not
*NL*
strike
you
,
but
that
revealed
itself
to
you
suddenly
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Basil
!
''
cried
the
lad
,
clutching
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
trembling
*NL*
hands
and
gazing
at
him
with
wild
startled
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see

from
the
moment

met
you

your
personality

the
most
*NL*
extraordinary
influence
over

I
was
dominated
,
soul
,
brain

and
*NL*
power

by

visible
incarnation
of
that
unseen
*NL*
ideal
whose
memory
haunts
us
artists
like
an
exquisite
dream
.
I
*NL*
worshipped
you
.
I
grew
jealous
of
every
one
to
whom
you
spoke
.
I
*NL*
wanted
to
have
you
all
to
myself
.
I
was
only
happy
when
I
was
with
*NL*
you
.
When
you
were
away
from
me
,
you
were
still
present
in
my
art
...
*NL*
Of
course
,
I
never
let
you
know
anything
about
this
.
It
would
have
*NL*
been
impossible
.
You
would
not
have
understood
it
.
I
hardly
*NL*
understood
it
myself
.
I
only
knew
that
I
had
seen
perfection
face
to
*NL*
face
,
and
that
the
world
had
become
wonderful
to
my
eyes
--
too
*NL*
wonderful
,
perhaps
,
for
in
such
mad
worships
there
is
peril
,
the
peril
*NL*
of
losing
them
,
no
less
than
the
peril
of
keeping
them
...
Weeks
and
*NL*
weeks
went
on
,
and
I
grew
more
and
more
absorbed
in
you
.
Then
came
a
*NL*
new
development
.
I
had
drawn
you
as
Paris
in
dainty
armour
,
and
as
*NL*
Adonis
with
huntsman
's
cloak
and
polished
boar-spear
.
Crowned
with
*NL*
heavy
lotus-blossoms
you
had
sat
on
the
prow
of
Adrian
's
barge
,
gazing
*NL*
across
the
green
turbid
Nile
.
You
had
leaned
over
the
still
pool
of
*NL*
some
Greek
woodland
and
seen
in
the
water
's
silent
silver
the
marvel
of
*NL*
your
own
face
.
And
it
had
all
been
what
art
should
be
--
unconscious
,
*NL*
ideal
,
and
remote
.
One
day
,
a
fatal
day
I
sometimes
think
,
I
*NL*
determined
to
paint
a
wonderful
portrait
of
you
as
you
actually
are
,
*NL*
not
in
the
costume
of
dead
ages
,
but
in
your
own
dress
and
in
your
own
*NL*
time
.
Whether
it
was
the
realism
of
the
method
,
or
the
mere
wonder
of
*NL*
your
own
personality
,
thus
directly
presented
to
me
without
mist
or
*NL*
veil
,
I
can
not
tell
.
But
I
know
that
as
I
worked
at
it
,
every
flake
*NL*
and
film
of
colour
seemed
to
me
to
reveal
my
secret
.
I
grew
afraid
*NL*
that
others
would
know
of
my
idolatry
.
I
felt
,
Dorian
,
that
I
had
told
*NL*
too
much
,
that
I
had
put
too
much
of
myself
into
it
.
Then
it
was
that
*NL*
I
resolved
never
to
allow
the
picture
to
be
exhibited
.
You
were
a
*NL*
little
annoyed
;
but
then
you
did
not
realize
all
that
it
meant
to
me
.
*NL*
Harry
,
to
whom
I
talked
about
it
,
laughed
at
me
.
But
I
did
not
mind
*NL*
that
.
When
the
picture
was
finished
,
and
I
sat
alone
with
it
,
I
felt
*NL*
that
I
was
right
...
Well
,
after
a
few
days
the
thing
left
my
studio
,
*NL*
and
as
soon
as
I
had
got
rid
of
the
intolerable
fascination
of
its
*NL*
presence
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
had
been
foolish
in
imagining
that
I
*NL*
had
seen
anything
in
it
,
more
than
that
you
were
extremely
good-looking
*NL*
and
that
I
could
paint
.
Even
now
I
can
not
help
feeling
that
it
is
a
*NL*
mistake
to
think
that
the
passion
one
feels
in
creation
is
ever
really
*NL*
shown
in
the
work
one
creates
.
Art
is
always
more
abstract
than
we
*NL*
fancy
.
Form
and
colour
tell
us
of
form
and
colour
--
that
is
all
.
It
*NL*
often
seems
to
me
that
art
conceals
the
artist
far
more
completely
than
*NL*
it
ever
reveals
him
.
And
so
when
I
got
this
offer
from
Paris
,
I
*NL*
determined
to
make
your
portrait
the
principal
thing
in
my
exhibition
.
*NL*
It
never
occurred
to
me
that
you
would
refuse
.
I
see
now
that
you
were
*NL*
right
.
The
picture
can
not
be
shown
.
You
must
not
be
angry
with
me
,
*NL*
Dorian
,
for
what
I
have
told
you
.
As
I
said
to
Harry
,
once
,
you
are
*NL*
made
to
be
worshipped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
drew
a
long
breath
.
The
colour
came
back
to
his
cheeks
,
*NL*
and
a
smile
played
about
his
lips
.
The
peril
was
over
.
He
was
safe
*NL*
for
the
time
.
Yet
he
could
not
help
feeling
infinite
pity
for
the
*NL*
painter
who
had
just
made
this
strange
confession
to
him
,
and
wondered
*NL*
if
he
himself
would
ever
be
so
dominated
by
the
personality
of
a
*NL*
friend
.
Lord
Henry
had
the
charm
of
being
very
dangerous
.
But
that
*NL*
was
all
.
He
was
too
clever
and
too
cynical
to
be
really
fond
of
.
*NL*
Would
there
ever
be
some
one
who
would
fill
him
with
a
strange
*NL*
idolatry
?
Was
that
one
of
the
things
that
life
had
in
store
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
extraordinary
to
me
,
Dorian
,
''
said
Hallward
,
``
that
you
should
*NL*
have
seen
this
in
the
portrait
.
Did
you
really
see
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
something
in
it
,
''
he
answered
,
``
something
that
seemed
to
me
very
*NL*
curious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
do
n't
mind
my
looking
at
the
thing
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
shook
his
head
.
``
You
must
not
ask
me
that
,
Basil
.
I
could
not
*NL*
possibly
let
you
stand
in
front
of
that
picture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
some
day
,
surely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
you
are
right
.
And
now
good-bye
,
Dorian
.
You
have
been
*NL*
the
one
person
in
my
life
who
has
really
influenced
my
art
.
Whatever
I
*NL*
have
done
that
is
good
,
I
owe
to
you
.
Ah
!
you
do
n't
know
what
it
cost
*NL*
me
to
tell
you
all
that
I
have
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Basil
,
''
said
Dorian
,
``
what
have
you
told
me
?
Simply
that
you
*NL*
felt
that
you
admired
me
too
much
.
That
is
not
even
a
compliment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
intended
as
a
compliment
.
It
was
a
confession
.
Now
that
I
*NL*
have
made
it
,
something
seems
to
have
gone
out
of
me
.
Perhaps
one
*NL*
should
never
put
one
's
worship
into
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
very
disappointing
confession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
did
you
expect
,
Dorian
?
You
did
n't
see
anything
else
in
the
*NL*
picture
,
did
you
?
There
was
nothing
else
to
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
there
was
nothing
else
to
see
.
Why
do
you
ask
?
But
you
must
n't
*NL*
talk
about
worship
.
It
is
foolish
.
You
and
I
are
friends
,
Basil
,
and
*NL*
we
must
always
remain
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
got
Harry
,
''
said
the
painter
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Harry
!
''
cried
the
lad
,
with
a
ripple
of
laughter
.
``
Harry
spends
*NL*
his
days
in
saying
what
is
incredible
and
his
evenings
in
doing
what
is
*NL*
improbable

Just
the
sort
of
life
I
would
like
to
lead
.
But
still
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
I
would
go
to
Harry
if
I
were
in
trouble
.
I
would
sooner
*NL*
go
to
you
,
Basil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
sit
to
me
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spoil
my
life
as
an
artist
by
refusing

Dorian

No
man
comes

across
two
ideal
things

Few
come
across
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
explain
it
to
you
,
Basil
,
but
I
must
never
sit
to
you
again

*NL*
There
is
something
fatal
about
a
portrait
.
It
has
a
life
of
its
own
.
*NL*
I
will
come
and
have
tea
with
you
.
That
will
be
just
as
pleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pleasanter
for
you
,
I
am
afraid
,
''
murmured
Hallward
regretfully
.
``
And
*NL*
now
good-bye
.
I
am
sorry
you
wo
n't

look
at

picture
once

again

But
that
ca
n't

I
quite
understand
what
you
feel
*NL*
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
left
the
room
,
Dorian
Gray
smiled
to
himself
.
Poor
Basil
!
How
*NL*
little
he
knew
of
the
true
reason
!
And
how
strange
it
was
that
,
*NL*
instead
of
having
been
forced
to
reveal
his
own
secret
,
he
had
*NL*
succeeded
,
almost
by
chance
,
in
wresting
a
secret
from
his
friend
!
How
*NL*
much
that
strange
confession
explained
to
him
!
The
painter
's
absurd
*NL*
fits
of
jealousy
,
his
wild
devotion
,
his
extravagant
panegyrics
,
his
*NL*
curious
reticences
--
he
understood
them
all
now
,
and
he
felt
sorry
.
*NL*
There
seemed
to
him
to
be
something
tragic
in
a
friendship
so
coloured
*NL*
by
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
and
touched
the
bell
.
The
portrait
must
be
hidden
away
at
*NL*
all
costs
.
He
could
not
run
such
a
risk
of
discovery
again
.
It
had
*NL*
been
mad
of
him
to
have
allowed
the
thing
to
remain
,
even
for
an
hour
,
*NL*
in
a
room
to
which
any
of
his
friends
had
access
.

CHAPTER
10
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
servant
entered
,
he
looked
at
him
steadfastly
and
wondered
if
*NL*
he
had
thought
of
peering
behind
the
screen
.
The
man
was
quite
*NL*
impassive
and
waited
for
his
orders
.
Dorian
lit
a
cigarette
and
walked
*NL*
over
to
the
glass
and
glanced
into
it
.
He
could
see
the
reflection
of
*NL*
Victor
's
face
perfectly
.
It
was
like
a
placid
mask
of
servility
.
*NL*
There
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
,
there
.
Yet
he
thought
it
best
to
be
*NL*
on
his
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Speaking
very
slowly
,
he
told
him
to
tell
the
house-keeper
that
he
*NL*
wanted
to
see
her
,
and
then
to
go
to
the
frame-maker
and
ask
him
to
*NL*
send
two
of
his
men
round
at
once
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
as
the
man
*NL*
left
the
room
his
eyes
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
screen
.
Or
was
*NL*
that
merely
his
own
fancy
?
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
moments
,
in
her
black
silk
dress
,
with
old-fashioned
thread
*NL*
mittens
on
her
wrinkled
hands
,
Mrs.
Leaf
bustled
into
the
library
.
He
*NL*
asked
her
for
the
key
of
the
schoolroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
schoolroom
,
Mr.
Dorian
?
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Why
,
it
is
full
of
*NL*
dust
.
I
must
get
it
arranged
and
put
straight
before
you
go
into
it
.
*NL*
It
is
not
fit
for
you
to
see
,
sir
.
It
is
not
,
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
it
put
straight
,
Leaf
.
I
only
want
the
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
you
'll
be
covered
with
cobwebs
if
you
go
into
it
.
Why
,
it
*NL*
has
n't
been
opened
for
nearly
five
years
--
not
since
his
lordship
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
winced
at
the
mention
of
his
grandfather
.
He
had
hateful
memories
*NL*
of
him
.
``
That
does
not
matter
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
simply
want
to
see
*NL*
the
place
--
that
is
all
.
Give
me
the
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
is
the
key
,
sir
,
''
said
the
old
lady
,
going
over
the
contents
*NL*
of
her
bunch
with
tremulously
uncertain
hands
.
``
Here
is
the
key
.
I
'll
*NL*
have
it
off
the
bunch
in
a
moment
.
But
you
do
n't
think
of
living
up
*NL*
there
,
sir
,
and
you
so
comfortable
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
he
cried
petulantly
.
``
Thank
you
,
Leaf
.
That
will
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lingered
for
a
few
moments
,
and
was
garrulous
over
some
detail
of
*NL*
the
household
.
He
sighed
and
told
her
to
manage
things
as
she
thought
*NL*
best
.
She
left
the
room
,
wreathed
in
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
door
closed
,
Dorian
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
looked
round
*NL*
the
room
.
His
eye
fell
on
a
large
,
purple
satin
coverlet
heavily
*NL*
embroidered
with
gold
,
a
splendid
piece
of
late
seventeenth-century
*NL*
Venetian
work
that
his
grandfather
had
found
in
a
convent
near
Bologna
.
*NL*
Yes
,
that
would
serve
to
wrap
the
dreadful
thing
in
.
It
had
perhaps
*NL*
served
often
as
a
pall
for
the
dead
.
Now
it
was
to
hide
something
that
*NL*
had
a
corruption
of
its
own
,
worse
than
the
corruption
of
death
*NL*
itself
--
something
that
would
breed
horrors
and
yet
would
never
die
.
*NL*
What
the
worm
was
to
the
corpse
,
his
sins
would
be
to
the
painted
image
*NL*
on
the
canvas
.
They
would
mar
its
beauty
and
eat
away
its
grace
.
They
*NL*
would
defile
it
and
make
it
shameful
.
And
yet
the
thing
would
still
*NL*
live
on
.
It
would
be
always
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shuddered
,
and
for
a
moment
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
told
Basil
*NL*
the
true
reason
why
he
had
wished
to
hide
the
picture
away
.
Basil
*NL*
would
have
helped
him
to
resist
Lord
Henry
's
influence
,
and
the
still
*NL*
more
poisonous
influences
that
came
from
his
own
temperament
.
The
love
*NL*
that
he
bore
him
--
for
it
was
really
love
--
had
nothing
in
it
that
was
*NL*
not
noble
and
intellectual
.
It
was
not
that
mere
physical
admiration
*NL*
of
beauty
that
is
born
of
the
senses
and
that
dies
when
the
senses
*NL*
tire
.
It
was
such
love
as
Michelangelo
had
known
,
and
Montaigne
,
and
*NL*
Winckelmann
,
and
Shakespeare
himself
.
Yes
,
Basil
could
have
saved
him
.
*NL*
But
it
was
too
late
now
.
The
past
could
always
be
annihilated
.
*NL*
Regret
,
denial
,
or
forgetfulness
could
do
that
.
But
the
future
was
*NL*
inevitable
.
There
were
passions
in
him
that
would
find
their
terrible
*NL*
outlet
,
dreams
that
would
make
the
shadow
of
their
evil
real
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
from
the
couch
the
great
purple-and-gold
texture
that
*NL*
covered
it
,
and
,
holding
it
in
his
hands
,
passed
behind
the
screen
.
*NL*
Was
the
face
on
the
canvas
viler
than
before
?
It
seemed
to
him
that
it
*NL*
was
unchanged
,
and
yet
his
loathing
of
it
was
intensified
.
Gold
hair
,
*NL*
blue
eyes
,
and
rose-red
lips
--
they
all
were
there
.
It
was
simply
the
*NL*
expression
that
had
altered
.
That
was
horrible
in
its
cruelty
.
*NL*
Compared
to
what
he
saw
in
it
of
censure
or
rebuke
,
how
shallow
Basil
's
*NL*
reproaches
about
Sibyl
Vane
had
been
!
--
how
shallow
,
and
of
what
little
*NL*
account
!
His
own
soul
was
looking
out
at
him
from
the
canvas
and
*NL*
calling
him
to
judgement
.
A
look
of
pain
came
across
him
,
and
he
flung
*NL*
the
rich
pall
over
the
picture
.
As
he
did
so
,
a
knock
came
to
the
*NL*
door
.
He
passed
out
as
his
servant
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
persons
are
here
,
Monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
the
man
must
be
got
rid
of
at
once
.
He
must
not
be
*NL*
allowed
to
know
where
the
picture
was
being
taken
to
.
There
was
*NL*
something
sly
about
him
,
and
he
had
thoughtful
,
treacherous
eyes
.
*NL*
Sitting
down
at
the
writing-table
he
scribbled
a
note
to
Lord
Henry
,
*NL*
asking
him
to
send
him
round
something
to
read
and
reminding
him
that
*NL*
they
were
to
meet
at
eight-fifteen
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
for
an
answer
,
''
he
said
,
handing
it
to
him
,
``
and
show
the
men
in
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
two
or
three
minutes
there
was
another
knock
,
and
Mr.
Hubbard
*NL*
himself
,
the
celebrated
frame-maker
of
South
Audley
Street
,
came
in
*NL*
with
a
somewhat
rough-looking
young
assistant
.
Mr.
Hubbard
was
a
*NL*
florid
,
red-whiskered
little
man
,
whose
admiration
for
art
was
*NL*
considerably
tempered
by
the
inveterate
impecuniosity
of
most
of
the
*NL*
artists
who
dealt
with
him
.
As
a
rule
,
he
never
left
his
shop
.
He
*NL*
waited
for
people
to
come
to
him
.
But
he
always
made
an
exception
in
*NL*
favour
of
Dorian
Gray
.
There
was
something
about
Dorian
that
charmed
*NL*
everybody
.
It
was
a
pleasure
even
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
Mr.
Gray
?
''
he
said
,
rubbing
his
fat
freckled
*NL*
hands
.
``
I
thought
I
would
do
myself
the
honour
of
coming
round
in
*NL*
person
.
I
have
just
got
a
beauty
of
a
frame
,
sir
.
Picked
it
up
at
a
*NL*
sale
.
Old
Florentine
.
Came
from
Fonthill
,
I
believe
.
Admirably
*NL*
suited
for
a
religious
subject
,
Mr.
Gray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
sorry
you
have
given
yourself
the
trouble
of
coming
round
,
Mr.
*NL*
Hubbard
.
I
shall
certainly
drop
in
and
look
at
the
frame
--
though
I
*NL*
do
n't
go
in
much
at
present
for
religious
art
--
but
to-day
I
only
want
a
*NL*
picture
carried
to
the
top
of
the
house
for
me
.
It
is
rather
heavy
,
so
*NL*
I
thought
I
would
ask
you
to
lend
me
a
couple
of
your
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
trouble
at
all
,
Mr.
Gray
.
I
am
delighted
to
be
of
any
service
to
*NL*
you
.
Which
is
the
work
of
art
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
replied
Dorian
,
moving
the
screen
back
.
``
Can
you
move
it
,
*NL*
covering
and
all
,
just
as
it
is
?
I
do
n't
want
it
to
get
scratched
*NL*
going
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
will
be
no
difficulty
,
sir
,
''
said
the
genial
frame-maker
,
*NL*
beginning
,
with
the
aid
of
his
assistant
,
to
unhook
the
picture
from
*NL*
the
long
brass
chains
by
which
it
was
suspended
.
``
And
,
now
,
where
*NL*
shall
we
carry
it
to
,
Mr.
Gray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
show
you
the
way
,
Mr.
Hubbard
,
if
you
will
kindly
follow
me
.
*NL*
Or
perhaps
you
had
better
go
in
front
.
I
am
afraid
it
is
right
at
the
*NL*
top
of
the
house
.
We
will
go
up
by
the
front
staircase
,
as
it
is
*NL*
wider
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
the
door
open
for
them
,
and
they
passed
out
into
the
hall
and
*NL*
began
the
ascent
.
The
elaborate
character
of
the
frame
had
made
the
*NL*
picture
extremely
bulky
,
and
now
and
then
,
in
spite
of
the
obsequious
*NL*
protests
of
Mr.
Hubbard
,
who
had
the
true
tradesman
's
spirited
dislike
*NL*
of
seeing
a
gentleman
doing
anything
useful
,
Dorian
put
his
hand
to
it
*NL*
so
as
to
help
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
of
a
load
to
carry
,
sir
,
''
gasped
the
little
man
when
they
*NL*
reached
the
top
landing
.
And
he
wiped
his
shiny
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
it
is
rather
heavy
,
''
murmured
Dorian
as
he
unlocked
the
*NL*
door
that
opened
into
the
room
that
was
to
keep
for
him
the
curious
*NL*
secret
of
his
life
and
hide
his
soul
from
the
eyes
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
entered
the
place
for
more
than
four
years
--
not
,
indeed
,
*NL*
since
he
had
used
it
first
as
a
play-room
when
he
was
a
child
,
and
then
*NL*
as
a
study
when
he
grew
somewhat
older
.
It
was
a
large
,
*NL*
well-proportioned
room
,
which
had
been
specially
built
by
the
last
Lord
*NL*
Kelso
for
the
use
of
the
little
grandson
whom
,
for
his
strange
likeness
*NL*
to
his
mother
,
and
also
for
other
reasons
,
he
had
always
hated
and
*NL*
desired
to
keep
at
a
distance
.
It
appeared
to
Dorian
to
have
but
*NL*
little
changed
.
There
was
the
huge
Italian
_
cassone
_
,
with
its
*NL*
fantastically
painted
panels
and
its
tarnished
gilt
mouldings
,
in
which
*NL*
he
had
so
often
hidden
himself
as
a
boy
.
There
the
satinwood
book-case
*NL*
filled
with
his
dog-eared
schoolbooks
.
On
the
wall
behind
it
was
*NL*
hanging
the
same
ragged
Flemish
tapestry
where
a
faded
king
and
queen
*NL*
were
playing
chess
in
a
garden
,
while
a
company
of
hawkers
rode
by
,
*NL*
carrying
hooded
birds
on
their
gauntleted
wrists
.
How
well
he
*NL*
remembered
it
all
!
Every
moment
of
his
lonely
childhood
came
back
to
*NL*
him
as
he
looked
round
.
He
recalled
the
stainless
purity
of
his
boyish
*NL*
life
,
and
it
seemed
horrible
to
him
that
it
was
here
the
fatal
portrait
*NL*
was
to
be
hidden
away
.
How
little
he
had
thought
,
in
those
dead
days
,
*NL*
of
all
that
was
in
store
for
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
other
place
in
the
house
so
secure
from
prying
eyes
as
*NL*
this
.
He
had
the
key
,
and
no
one
else
could
enter
it
.
Beneath
its
*NL*
purple
pall
,
the
face
painted
on
the
canvas
could
grow
bestial
,
sodden
,
*NL*
and
unclean
.
What
did
it
matter
?
No
one
could
see
it
.
He
himself
*NL*
would
not
see
it
.
Why
should
he
watch
the
hideous
corruption
of
his
*NL*
soul
?
He
kept
his
youth
--
that
was
enough
.
And
,
besides
,
might
not
*NL*
his
nature
grow
finer
,
after
all
?
There
was
no
reason
that
the
future
*NL*
should
be
so
full
of
shame
.
Some
love
might
come
across
his
life
,
and
*NL*
purify
him
,
and
shield
him
from
those
sins
that
seemed
to
be
already
*NL*
stirring
in
spirit
and
in
flesh
--
those
curious
unpictured
sins
whose
*NL*
very
mystery
lent
them
their
subtlety
and
their
charm
.
Perhaps
,
some
*NL*
day
,
the
cruel
look
would
have
passed
away
from
the
scarlet
sensitive
*NL*
mouth
,
and
he
might
show
to
the
world
Basil
Hallward
's
masterpiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
;
that
was
impossible
.
Hour
by
hour
,
and
week
by
week
,
the
thing
*NL*
upon
the
canvas
was
growing
old
.
It
might
escape
the
hideousness
of
*NL*
sin
,
but
the
hideousness
of
age
was
in
store
for
it
.
The
cheeks
would
*NL*
become
hollow
or
flaccid
.
Yellow
crow
's
feet
would
creep
round
the
*NL*
fading
eyes
and
make
them
horrible
.
The
hair
would
lose
its
*NL*
brightness
,
the
mouth
would
gape
or
droop
,
would
be
foolish
or
gross
,
*NL*
as
the
mouths
of
old
men
are
.
There
would
be
the
wrinkled
throat
,
the
*NL*
cold
,
blue-veined
hands
,
the
twisted
body
,
that
he
remembered
in
the
*NL*
grandfather
who
had
been
so
stern
to
him
in
his
boyhood
.
The
picture
*NL*
had
to
be
concealed
.
There
was
no
help
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
it
in
,
Mr.
Hubbard
,
please
,
''
he
said
,
wearily
,
turning
round
.
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
I
kept
you
so
long
.
I
was
thinking
of
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
glad
to
have
a
rest
,
Mr.
Gray
,
''
answered
the
frame-maker
,
who
*NL*
was
still
gasping
for
breath
.
``
Where
shall
we
put
it
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
anywhere
.
Here
:
this
will
do
.
I
do
n't
want
to
have
it
hung
up
.
*NL*
Just
lean
it
against
the
wall
.
Thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
one
look
at
the
work
of
art
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
started
.
``
It
would
not
interest
you
,
Mr.
Hubbard
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
keeping
his
eye
on
the
man
.
He
felt
ready
to
leap
upon
him
and
fling
*NL*
him
to
the
ground
if
he
dared
to
lift
the
gorgeous
hanging
that
*NL*
concealed
the
secret
of
his
life
.
``
I
sha
n't
trouble
you
any
more
now
.
*NL*
I
am
much
obliged
for
your
kindness
in
coming
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
not
at
all
,
Mr.
Gray
.
Ever
ready
to
do
anything
for
you
,
*NL*
sir
.
''
And
Mr.
Hubbard
tramped
downstairs
,
followed
by
the
assistant
,
*NL*
who
glanced
back
at
Dorian
with
a
look
of
shy
wonder
in
his
rough
*NL*
uncomely
face
.
He
had
never
seen
any
one
so
marvellous
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
had
died
away
,
Dorian
locked
the
door
*NL*
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
He
felt
safe
now
.
No
one
would
ever
*NL*
look
upon
the
horrible
thing
.
No
eye
but
his
would
ever
see
his
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
library
,
he
found
that
it
was
just
after
five
o'clock
*NL*
and
that
the
tea
had
been
already
brought
up
.
On
a
little
table
of
*NL*
dark
perfumed
wood
thickly
incrusted
with
nacre
,
a
present
from
Lady
*NL*
Radley
,
his
guardian
's
wife
,
a
pretty
professional
invalid
who
had
*NL*
spent
the
preceding
winter
in
Cairo
,
was
lying
a
note
from
Lord
Henry
,
*NL*
and
beside
it
was
a
book
bound
in
yellow
paper
,
the
cover
slightly
torn
*NL*
and
the
edges
soiled
.
A
copy
of
the
third
edition
of
_
The
St.
James
's
*NL*
Gazette
_
had
been
placed
on
the
tea-tray
.
It
was
evident
that
Victor
had
*NL*
returned
.
He
wondered
if
he
had
met
the
men
in
the
hall
as
they
were
*NL*
leaving
the
house
and
had
wormed
out
of
them
what
they
had
been
doing
.
*NL*
He
would
be
sure
to
miss
the
picture
--
had
no
doubt
missed
it
already
,
*NL*
while
he
had
been
laying
the
tea-things
.
The
screen
had
not
been
set
*NL*
back
,
and
a
blank
space
was
visible
on
the
wall
.
Perhaps
some
night
he
*NL*
might
find
him
creeping
upstairs
and
trying
to
force
the
door
of
the
*NL*
room
.
It
was
a
horrible
thing
to
have
a
spy
in
one
's
house
.
He
had
*NL*
heard
of
rich
men
who
had
been
blackmailed
all
their
lives
by
some
*NL*
servant
who
had
read
a
letter
,
or
overheard
a
conversation
,
or
picked
*NL*
up
a
card
with
an
address
,
or
found
beneath
a
pillow
a
withered
flower
*NL*
or
a
shred
of
crumpled
lace
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
,
and
having
poured
himself
out
some
tea
,
opened
Lord
Henry
's
*NL*
note
.
It
was
simply
to
say
that
he
sent
him
round
the
evening
paper
,
*NL*
and
a
book
that
might
interest
him
,
and
that
he
would
be
at
the
club
at
*NL*
eight-fifteen
.
He
opened
_
The
St.
James
's
_
languidly
,
and
looked
through
*NL*
it
.
A
red
pencil-mark
on
the
fifth
page
caught
his
eye
.
It
drew
*NL*
attention
to
the
following
paragraph
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
INQUEST
ON
AN
ACTRESS
.
--
An
inquest
was
held
this
morning
at
the
Bell
*NL*
Tavern
,
Hoxton
Road
,
by
Mr.
Danby
,
the
District
Coroner
,
on
the
body
of
*NL*
Sibyl
Vane
,
a
young
actress
recently
engaged
at
the
Royal
Theatre
,
*NL*
Holborn
.
A
verdict
of
death
by
misadventure
was
returned
.
*NL*
Considerable
sympathy
was
expressed
for
the
mother
of
the
deceased
,
who
*NL*
was
greatly
affected
during
the
giving
of
her
own
evidence
,
and
that
of
*NL*
Dr.
Birrell
,
who
had
made
the
post-mortem
examination
of
the
deceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
,
and
tearing
the
paper
in
two
,
went
across
the
room
and
*NL*
flung
the
pieces
away
.
How
ugly
it
all
was
!
And
how
horribly
real
*NL*
ugliness
made
things
!
He
felt
a
little
annoyed
with
Lord
Henry
for
*NL*
having
sent
him
the
report
.
And
it
was
certainly
stupid
of
him
to
have
*NL*
marked
it
with
red
pencil
.
Victor
might
have
read
it
.
The
man
knew
*NL*
more
than
enough
English
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
he
had
read
it
and
had
begun
to
suspect
something
.
And
,
yet
,
*NL*
what
did
it
matter
?
What
had
Dorian
Gray
to
do
with
Sibyl
Vane
's
*NL*
death
?
There
was
nothing
to
fear
.
Dorian
Gray
had
not
killed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eye
fell
on
the
yellow
book
that
Lord
Henry
had
sent
him
.
What
was
*NL*
it
,
he
wondered
.
He
went
towards
the
little
,
pearl-coloured
octagonal
*NL*
stand
that
had
always
looked
to
him
like
the
work
of
some
strange
*NL*
Egyptian
bees
that
wrought
in
silver
,
and
taking
up
the
volume
,
flung
*NL*
himself
into
an
arm-chair
and
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
.
After
a
*NL*
few
minutes
he
became
absorbed
.
It
was
the
strangest
book
that
he
had
*NL*
ever
read
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
in
exquisite
raiment
,
and
to
the
*NL*
delicate
sound
of
flutes
,
the
sins
of
the
world
were
passing
in
dumb
*NL*
show
before
him
.
Things
that
he
had
dimly
dreamed
of
were
suddenly
*NL*
made
real
to
him
.
Things
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
were
gradually
*NL*
revealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
novel
without
a
plot
and
with
only
one
character
,
being
,
*NL*
indeed
,
simply
a
psychological
study
of
a
certain
young
Parisian
who
*NL*
spent
his
life
trying
to
realize
in
the
nineteenth
century
all
the
*NL*
passions
and
modes
of
thought
that
belonged
to
every
century
except
his
*NL*
own
,
and
to
sum
up
,
as
it
were
,
in
himself
the
various
moods
through
*NL*
which
the
world-spirit
had
ever
passed
,
loving
for
their
mere
*NL*
artificiality
those
renunciations
that
men
have
unwisely
called
virtue
,
*NL*
as
much
as
those
natural
rebellions
that
wise
men
still
call
sin
.
The
*NL*
style
in
which
it
was
written
was
that
curious
jewelled
style
,
vivid
*NL*
and
obscure
at
once
,
full
of
_
argot
_
and
of
archaisms
,
of
technical
*NL*
expressions
and
of
elaborate
paraphrases
,
that
characterizes
the
work
*NL*
of
some
of
the
finest
artists
of
the
French
school
of
_
Symbolistes
_
.
*NL*
There
were
in
it
metaphors
as
monstrous
as
orchids
and
as
subtle
in
*NL*
colour
.
The
life
of
the
senses
was
described
in
the
terms
of
mystical
*NL*
philosophy
.
One
hardly
knew
at
times
whether
one
was
reading
the
*NL*
spiritual
ecstasies
of
some
mediaeval
saint
or
the
morbid
confessions
*NL*
of
a
modern
sinner
.
It
was
a
poisonous
book
.
The
heavy
odour
of
*NL*
incense
seemed
to
cling
about
its
pages
and
to
trouble
the
brain
.
The
*NL*
mere
cadence
of
the
sentences
,
the
subtle
monotony
of
their
music
,
so
*NL*
full
as
it
was
of
complex
refrains
and
movements
elaborately
repeated
,
*NL*
produced
in
the
mind
of
the
lad
,
as
he
passed
from
chapter
to
chapter
,
*NL*
a
form
of
reverie
,
a
malady
of
dreaming
,
that
made
him
unconscious
of
*NL*
the
falling
day
and
creeping
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cloudless
,
and
pierced
by
one
solitary
star
,
a
copper-green
sky
gleamed
*NL*
through
the
windows
.
He
read
on
by
its
wan
light
till
he
could
read
no
*NL*
more
.
Then
,
after
his
valet
had
reminded
him
several
times
of
the
*NL*
lateness
of
the
hour
,
he
got
up
,
and
going
into
the
next
room
,
placed
*NL*
the
book
on
the
little
Florentine
table
that
always
stood
at
his
*NL*
bedside
and
began
to
dress
for
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
almost
nine
o'clock
before
he
reached
the
club
,
where
he
found
*NL*
Lord
Henry
sitting
alone
,
in
the
morning-room
,
looking
very
much
bored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
sorry
,
Harry
,
''
he
cried
,
``
but
really
it
is
entirely
your
*NL*
fault
.
That
book
you
sent
me
so
fascinated
me
that
I
forgot
how
the
*NL*
time
was
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
thought
you
would
like
it
,
''
replied
his
host
,
rising
from
his
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
I
liked
it
,
Harry
.
I
said
it
fascinated
me
.
There
is
a
*NL*
great
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
have
discovered
that
?
''
murmured
Lord
Henry
.
And
they
passed
*NL*
into
the
dining-room
.

CHAPTER
11
*NL*
*NL*
For
years
,
Dorian
Gray
could
not
free
himself
from
the
influence
of
*NL*
this
book
.
Or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
he
never
*NL*
sought
to
free
himself
from
it
.
He
procured
from
Paris
no
less
than
*NL*
nine
large-paper
copies
of
the
first
edition
,
and
had
them
bound
in
*NL*
different
colours
,
so
that
they
might
suit
his
various
moods
and
the
*NL*
changing
fancies
of
a
nature
over
which
he
seemed
,
at
times
,
to
have
*NL*
almost
entirely
lost
control
.
The
hero
,
the
wonderful
young
Parisian
*NL*
in
whom
the
romantic
and
the
scientific
temperaments
were
so
strangely
*NL*
blended
,
became
to
him
a
kind
of
prefiguring
type
of
himself
.
And
,
*NL*
indeed
,
the
whole
book
seemed
to
him
to
contain
the
story
of
his
own
*NL*
life
,
written
before
he
had
lived
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
point
he
was
more
fortunate
than
the
novel
's
fantastic
hero
.
He
*NL*
never
knew
--
never
,
indeed
,
had
any
cause
to
know
--
that
somewhat
*NL*
grotesque
dread
of
mirrors
,
and
polished
metal
surfaces
,
and
still
*NL*
water
which
came
upon
the
young
Parisian
so
early
in
his
life
,
and
was
*NL*
occasioned
by
the
sudden
decay
of
a
beau
that
had
once
,
apparently
,
*NL*
been
so
remarkable
.
It
was
with
an
almost
cruel
joy
--
and
perhaps
in
*NL*
nearly
every
joy
,
as
certainly
in
every
pleasure
,
cruelty
has
its
*NL*
place
--
that
he
used
to
read
the
latter
part
of
the
book
,
with
its
*NL*
really
tragic
,
if
somewhat
overemphasized
,
account
of
the
sorrow
and
*NL*
despair
of
one
who
had
himself
lost
what
in
others
,
and
the
world
,
he
*NL*
had
most
dearly
valued
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
wonderful
beauty
that
had
so
fascinated
Basil
Hallward
,
and
*NL*
many
others
besides
him
,
seemed
never
to
leave
him
.
Even
those
who
had
*NL*
heard
the
most
evil
things
against
him
--
and
from
time
to
time
strange
*NL*
rumours
about
his
mode
of
life
crept
through
London
and
became
the
*NL*
chatter
of
the
clubs
--
could
not
believe
anything
to
his
dishonour
when
*NL*
they
saw
him
.
He
had
always
the
look
of
one
who
had
kept
himself
*NL*
unspotted
from
the
world
.
Men
who
talked
grossly
became
silent
when
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
entered
the
room
.
There
was
something
in
the
purity
of
his
*NL*
face
that
rebuked
them
.
His
mere
presence
seemed
to
recall
to
them
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
innocence
that
they
had
tarnished
.
They
wondered
how
one
*NL*
so
charming
and
graceful
as
he
was
could
have
escaped
the
stain
of
an
*NL*
age
that
was
at
once
sordid
and
sensual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
on
returning
home
from
one
of
those
mysterious
and
prolonged
*NL*
absences
that
gave
rise
to
such
strange
conjecture
among
those
who
were
*NL*
his
friends
,
or
thought
that
they
were
so
,
he
himself
would
creep
*NL*
upstairs
to
the
locked
room
,
open
the
door
with
the
key
that
never
left
*NL*
him
now
,
and
stand
,
with
a
mirror
,
in
front
of
the
portrait
that
Basil
*NL*
Hallward
had
painted
of
him
,
looking
now
at
the
evil
and
aging
face
on
*NL*
the
canvas
,
and
now
at
the
fair
young
face
that
laughed
back
at
him
*NL*
from
the
polished
glass
.
The
very
sharpness
of
the
contrast
used
to
*NL*
quicken
his
sense
of
pleasure
.
He
grew
more
and
more
enamoured
of
his
*NL*
own
beauty
,
more
and
more
interested
in
the
corruption
of
his
own
soul
.
*NL*
He
would
examine
with
minute
care
,
and
sometimes
with
a
monstrous
and
*NL*
terrible
delight
,
the
hideous
lines
that
seared
the
wrinkling
forehead
*NL*
or
crawled
around
the
heavy
sensual
mouth
,
wondering
sometimes
which
*NL*
were
the
more
horrible
,
the
signs
of
sin
or
the
signs
of
age
.
He
would
*NL*
place
his
white
hands
beside
the
coarse
bloated
hands
of
the
picture
,
*NL*
and
smile
.
He
mocked
the
misshapen
body
and
the
failing
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
moments
,
indeed
,
at
night
,
when
,
lying
sleepless
in
his
own
*NL*
delicately
scented
chamber
,
or
in
the
sordid
room
of
the
little
*NL*
ill-famed
tavern
near
the
docks
which
,
under
an
assumed
name
and
in
*NL*
disguise
,
it
was
his
habit
to
frequent
,
he
would
think
of
the
ruin
he
*NL*
had
brought
upon
his
soul
with
a
pity
that
was
all
the
more
poignant
*NL*
because
it
was
purely
selfish
.
But
moments
such
as
these
were
rare
.
*NL*
That
curiosity
about
life
which
Lord
Henry
had
first
stirred
in
him
,
as
*NL*
they
sat
together
in
the
garden
of
their
friend
,
seemed
to
increase
*NL*
with
gratification
.
The
more
he
knew
,
the
more
he
desired
to
know
.
He
*NL*
had
mad
hungers
that
grew
more
ravenous
as
he
fed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
was
not
really
reckless
,
at
any
rate
in
his
relations
to
*NL*
society
.
Once
or
twice
every
month
during
the
winter
,
and
on
each
*NL*
Wednesday
evening
while
the
season
lasted
,
he
would
throw
open
to
the
*NL*
world
his
beautiful
house
and
have
the
most
celebrated
musicians
of
the
*NL*
day
to
charm
his
guests
with
the
wonders
of
their
art
.
His
little
*NL*
dinners
,
in
the
settling
of
which
Lord
Henry
always
assisted
him
,
were
*NL*
noted
as
much
for
the
careful
selection
and
placing
of
those
invited
,
*NL*
as
for
the
exquisite
taste
shown
in
the
decoration
of
the
table
,
with
*NL*
its
subtle
symphonic
arrangements
of
exotic
flowers
,
and
embroidered
*NL*
cloths
,
and
antique
plate
of
gold
and
silver
.
Indeed
,
there
were
many
,
*NL*
especially
among
the
very
young
men
,
who
saw
,
or
fancied
that
they
saw
,
*NL*
in
Dorian
Gray
the
true
realization
of
a
type
of
which
they
had
often
*NL*
dreamed
in
Eton
or
Oxford
days
,
a
type
that
was
to
combine
something
of
*NL*
the
real
culture
of
the
scholar
with
all
the
grace
and
distinction
and
*NL*
perfect
manner
of
a
citizen
of
the
world
.
To
them
he
seemed
to
be
of
*NL*
the
company
of
those
whom
Dante
describes
as
having
sought
to
``
make
*NL*
themselves
perfect
by
the
worship
of
beauty
.
''
Like
Gautier
,
he
was
one
*NL*
for
whom
``
the
visible
world
existed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
certainly
,
to
him
life
itself
was
the
first
,
the
greatest
,
of
the
*NL*
arts
,
and
for
it
all
the
other
arts
seemed
to
be
but
a
preparation
.
*NL*
Fashion
,
by
which
what
is
really
fantastic
becomes
for
a
moment
*NL*
universal
,
and
dandyism
,
which
,
in
its
own
way
,
is
an
attempt
to
assert
*NL*
the
absolute
modernity
of
beauty
,
had
,
of
course
,
their
fascination
for
*NL*
him
.
His
mode
of
dressing
,
and
the
particular
styles
that
from
time
to
*NL*
time
he
affected
,
had
their
marked
influence
on
the
young
exquisites
of
*NL*
the
Mayfair
balls
and
Pall
Mall
club
windows
,
who
copied
him
in
*NL*
everything
that
he
did
,
and
tried
to
reproduce
the
accidental
charm
of
*NL*
his
graceful
,
though
to
him
only
half-serious
,
fopperies
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
while
he
was
but
too
ready
to
accept
the
position
that
was
almost
*NL*
immediately
offered
to
him
on
his
coming
of
age
,
and
found
,
indeed
,
a
*NL*
subtle
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
he
might
really
become
to
the
*NL*
London
of
his
own
day
what
to
imperial
Neronian
Rome
the
author
of
the
*NL*
Satyricon
once
had
been
,
yet
in
his
inmost
heart
he
desired
to
be
*NL*
something
more
than
a
mere
_
arbiter
elegantiarum
_
,
to
be
consulted
on
the
*NL*
wearing
of
a
jewel
,
or
the
knotting
of
a
necktie
,
or
the
conduct
of
a
*NL*
cane
.
He
sought
to
elaborate
some
new
scheme
of
life
that
would
have
*NL*
its
reasoned
philosophy
and
its
ordered
principles
,
and
find
in
the
*NL*
spiritualizing
of
the
senses
its
highest
realization
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
worship
of
the
senses
has
often
,
and
with
much
justice
,
been
*NL*
decried
,
men
feeling
a
natural
instinct
of
terror
about
passions
and
*NL*
sensations
that
seem
stronger
than
themselves
,
and
that
they
are
*NL*
conscious
of
sharing
with
the
less
highly
organized
forms
of
existence
.
*NL*
But
it
appeared
to
Dorian
Gray
that
the
true
nature
of
the
senses
had
*NL*
never
been
understood
,
and
that
they
had
remained
savage
and
animal
*NL*
merely
because
the
world
had
sought
to
starve
them
into
submission
or
*NL*
to
kill
them
by
pain
,
instead
of
aiming
at
making
them
elements
of
a
*NL*
new
spirituality
,
of
which
a
fine
instinct
for
beauty
was
to
be
the
*NL*
dominant
characteristic
.
As
he
looked
back
upon
man
moving
through
*NL*
history
,
he
was
haunted
by
a
feeling
of
loss
.
So
much
had
been
*NL*
surrendered
!
and
to
such
little
purpose
!
There
had
been
mad
wilful
*NL*
rejections
,
monstrous
forms
of
self-torture
and
self-denial
,
whose
*NL*
origin
was
fear
and
whose
result
was
a
degradation
infinitely
more
*NL*
terrible
than
that
fancied
degradation
from
which
,
in
their
ignorance
,
*NL*
they
had
sought
to
escape
;
Nature
,
in
her
wonderful
irony
,
driving
out
*NL*
the
anchorite
to
feed
with
the
wild
animals
of
the
desert
and
giving
to
*NL*
the
hermit
the
beasts
of
the
field
as
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
:
there
was
to
be
,
as
Lord
Henry
had
prophesied
,
a
new
Hedonism
*NL*
that
was
to
recreate
life
and
to
save
it
from
that
harsh
uncomely
*NL*
puritanism
that
is
having
,
in
our
own
day
,
its
curious
revival
.
It
was
*NL*
to
have
its
service
of
the
intellect
,
certainly
,
yet
it
was
never
to
*NL*
accept
any
theory
or
system
that
would
involve
the
sacrifice
of
any
*NL*
mode
of
passionate
experience
.
Its
aim
,
indeed
,
was
to
be
experience
*NL*
itself
,
and
not
the
fruits
of
experience
,
sweet
or
bitter
as
they
might
*NL*
be
.
Of
the
asceticism
that
deadens
the
senses
,
as
of
the
vulgar
*NL*
profligacy
that
dulls
them
,
it
was
to
know
nothing
.
But
it
was
to
*NL*
teach
man
to
concentrate
himself
upon
the
moments
of
a
life
that
is
*NL*
itself
but
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
few
of
us
who
have
not
sometimes
wakened
before
dawn
,
either
*NL*
after
one
of
those
dreamless
nights
that
make
us
almost
enamoured
of
*NL*
death
,
or
one
of
those
nights
of
horror
and
misshapen
joy
,
when
through
*NL*
the
chambers
of
the
brain
sweep
phantoms
more
terrible
than
reality
*NL*
itself
,
and
instinct
with
that
vivid
life
that
lurks
in
all
grotesques
,
*NL*
and
that
lends
to
Gothic
art
its
enduring
vitality
,
this
art
being
,
one
*NL*
might
fancy
,
especially
the
art
of
those
whose
minds
have
been
troubled
*NL*
with
the
malady
of
reverie
.
Gradually
white
fingers
creep
through
the
*NL*
curtains
,
and
they
appear
to
tremble
.
In
black
fantastic
shapes
,
dumb
*NL*
shadows
crawl
into
the
corners
of
the
room
and
crouch
there
.
Outside
,
*NL*
there
is
the
stirring
of
birds
among
the
leaves
,
or
the
sound
of
men
*NL*
going
forth
to
their
work
,
or
the
sigh
and
sob
of
the
wind
coming
down
*NL*
from
the
hills
and
wandering
round
the
silent
house
,
as
though
it
*NL*
feared
to
wake
the
sleepers
and
yet
must
needs
call
forth
sleep
from
*NL*
her
purple
cave
.
Veil
after
veil
of
thin
dusky
gauze
is
lifted
,
and
by
*NL*
degrees
the
forms
and
colours
of
things
are
restored
to
them
,
and
we
*NL*
watch
the
dawn
remaking
the
world
in
its
antique
pattern
.
The
wan
*NL*
mirrors
get
back
their
mimic
life
.
The
flameless
tapers
stand
where
we
*NL*
had
left
them
,
and
beside
them
lies
the
half-cut
book
that
we
had
been
*NL*
studying
,
or
the
wired
flower
that
we
had
worn
at
the
ball
,
or
the
*NL*
letter
that
we
had
been
afraid
to
read
,
or
that
we
had
read
too
often
.
*NL*
Nothing
seems
to
us
changed
.
Out
of
the
unreal
shadows
of
the
night
*NL*
comes
back
the
real
life
that
we
had
known
.
We
have
to
resume
it
where
*NL*
we
had
left
off
,
and
there
steals
over
us
a
terrible
sense
of
the
*NL*
necessity
for
the
continuance
of
energy
in
the
same
wearisome
round
of
*NL*
stereotyped
habits
,
or
a
wild
longing
,
it
may
be
,
that
our
eyelids
*NL*
might
open
some
morning
upon
a
world
that
had
been
refashioned
anew
in
*NL*
the
darkness
for
our
pleasure
,
a
world
in
which
things
would
have
fresh
*NL*
shapes
and
colours
,
and
be
changed
,
or
have
other
secrets
,
a
world
in
*NL*
which
the
past
would
have
little
or
no
place
,
or
survive
,
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
in
no
conscious
form
of
obligation
or
regret
,
the
remembrance
even
of
*NL*
joy
having
its
bitterness
and
the
memories
of
pleasure
their
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
creation
of
such
worlds
as
these
that
seemed
to
Dorian
Gray
*NL*
to
be
the
true
object
,
or
amongst
the
true
objects
,
of
life
;
and
in
his
*NL*
search
for
sensations
that
would
be
at
once
new
and
delightful
,
and
*NL*
possess
that
element
of
strangeness
that
is
so
essential
to
romance
,
he
*NL*
would
often
adopt
certain
modes
of
thought
that
he
knew
to
be
really
*NL*
alien
to
his
nature
,
abandon
himself
to
their
subtle
influences
,
and
*NL*
then
,
having
,
as
it
were
,
caught
their
colour
and
satisfied
his
*NL*
intellectual
curiosity
,
leave
them
with
that
curious
indifference
that
*NL*
is
not
incompatible
with
a
real
ardour
of
temperament
,
and
that
,
*NL*
indeed
,
according
to
certain
modern
psychologists
,
is
often
a
condition
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
rumoured
of
him
once
that
he
was
about
to
join
the
Roman
*NL*
Catholic
communion
,
and
certainly
the
Roman
ritual
had
always
a
great
*NL*
attraction
for
him
.
The
daily
sacrifice
,
more
awful
really
than
all
*NL*
the
sacrifices
of
the
antique
world
,
stirred
him
as
much
by
its
superb
*NL*
rejection
of
the
evidence
of
the
senses
as
by
the
primitive
simplicity
*NL*
of
its
elements
and
the
eternal
pathos
of
the
human
tragedy
that
it
*NL*
sought
to
symbolize
.
He
loved
to
kneel
down
on
the
cold
marble
*NL*
pavement
and
watch
the
priest
,
in
his
stiff
flowered
dalmatic
,
slowly
*NL*
and
with
white
hands
moving
aside
the
veil
of
the
tabernacle
,
or
*NL*
raising
aloft
the
jewelled
,
lantern-shaped
monstrance
with
that
pallid
*NL*
wafer
that
at
times
,
one
would
fain
think
,
is
indeed
the
''
_
panis
*NL*
caelestis
_
,
''
the
bread
of
angels
,
or
,
robed
in
the
garments
of
the
*NL*
Passion
of
Christ
,
breaking
the
Host
into
the
chalice
and
smiting
his
*NL*
breast
for
his
sins
.
The
fuming
censers
that
the
grave
boys
,
in
their
*NL*
lace
and
scarlet
,
tossed
into
the
air
like
great
gilt
flowers
had
their
*NL*
subtle
fascination
for
him
.
As
he
passed
out
,
he
used
to
look
with
*NL*
wonder
at
the
black
confessionals
and
long
to
sit
in
the
dim
shadow
of
*NL*
one
of
them
and
listen
to
men
and
women
whispering
through
the
worn
*NL*
grating
the
true
story
of
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
never
fell
into
the
error
of
arresting
his
intellectual
*NL*
development
by
any
formal
acceptance
of
creed
or
system
,
or
of
*NL*
mistaking
,
for
a
house
in
which
to
live
,
an
inn
that
is
but
suitable
*NL*
for
the
sojourn
of
a
night
,
or
for
a
few
hours
of
a
night
in
which
*NL*
there
are
no
stars
and
the
moon
is
in
travail
.
Mysticism
,
with
its
*NL*
marvellous
power
of
making
common
things
strange
to
us
,
and
the
subtle
*NL*
antinomianism
that
always
seems
to
accompany
it
,
moved
him
for
a
*NL*
season
;
and
for
a
season
he
inclined
to
the
materialistic
doctrines
of
*NL*
the
_
Darwinismus
_
movement
in
Germany
,
and
found
a
curious
pleasure
in
*NL*
tracing
the
thoughts
and
passions
of
men
to
some
pearly
cell
in
the
*NL*
brain
,
or
some
white
nerve
in
the
body
,
delighting
in
the
conception
of
*NL*
the
absolute
dependence
of
the
spirit
on
certain
physical
conditions
,
*NL*
morbid
or
healthy
,
normal
or
diseased
.
Yet
,
as
has
been
said
of
him
*NL*
before
,
no
theory
of
life
seemed
to
him
to
be
of
any
importance
*NL*
compared
with
life
itself
.
He
felt
keenly
conscious
of
how
barren
all
*NL*
intellectual
speculation
is
when
separated
from
action
and
experiment
.
*NL*
He
knew
that
the
senses
,
no
less
than
the
soul
,
have
their
spiritual
*NL*
mysteries
to
reveal
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
would
now
study
perfumes
and
the
secrets
of
their
*NL*
manufacture
,
distilling
heavily
scented
oils
and
burning
odorous
gums
*NL*
from
the
East
.
He
saw
that
there
was
no
mood
of
the
mind
that
had
not
*NL*
its
counterpart
in
the
sensuous
life
,
and
set
himself
to
discover
their
*NL*
true
relations
,
wondering
what
there
was
in
frankincense
that
made
one
*NL*
mystical
,
and
in
ambergris
that
stirred
one
's
passions
,
and
in
violets
*NL*
that
woke
the
memory
of
dead
romances
,
and
in
musk
that
troubled
the
*NL*
brain
,
and
in
champak
that
stained
the
imagination
;
and
seeking
often
*NL*
to
elaborate
a
real
psychology
of
perfumes
,
and
to
estimate
the
several
*NL*
influences
of
sweet-smelling
roots
and
scented
,
pollen-laden
flowers
;
*NL*
of
aromatic
balms
and
of
dark
and
fragrant
woods
;
of
spikenard
,
that
*NL*
sickens
;
of
hovenia
,
that
makes
men
mad
;
and
of
aloes
,
that
are
said
to
*NL*
be
able
to
expel
melancholy
from
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
another
time
he
devoted
himself
entirely
to
music
,
and
in
a
long
*NL*
latticed
room
,
with
a
vermilion-and-gold
ceiling
and
walls
of
*NL*
olive-green
lacquer
,
he
used
to
give
curious
concerts
in
which
mad
*NL*
gipsies
tore
wild
music
from
little
zithers
,
or
grave
,
yellow-shawled
*NL*
Tunisians
plucked
at
the
strained
strings
of
monstrous
lutes
,
while
*NL*
grinning
Negroes
beat
monotonously
upon
copper
drums
and
,
crouching
*NL*
upon
scarlet
mats
,
slim
turbaned
Indians
blew
through
long
pipes
of
*NL*
reed
or
brass
and
charmed
--
or
feigned
to
charm
--
great
hooded
snakes
and
*NL*
horrible
horned
adders
.
The
harsh
intervals
and
shrill
discords
of
*NL*
barbaric
music
stirred
him
at
times
when
Schubert
's
grace
,
and
Chopin
's
*NL*
beautiful
sorrows
,
and
the
mighty
harmonies
of
Beethoven
himself
,
fell
*NL*
unheeded
on
his
ear
.
He
collected
together
from
all
parts
of
the
world
*NL*
the
strangest
instruments
that
could
be
found
,
either
in
the
tombs
of
*NL*
dead
nations
or
among
the
few
savage
tribes
that
have
survived
contact
*NL*
with
Western
civilizations
,
and
loved
to
touch
and
try
them
.
He
had
*NL*
the
mysterious
_
juruparis
_
of
the
Rio
Negro
Indians
,
that
women
are
not
*NL*
allowed
to
look
at
and
that
even
youths
may
not
see
till
they
have
been
*NL*
subjected
to
fasting
and
scourging
,
and
the
earthen
jars
of
the
*NL*
Peruvians
that
have
the
shrill
cries
of
birds
,
and
flutes
of
human
*NL*
bones
such
as
Alfonso
de
Ovalle
heard
in
Chile
,
and
the
sonorous
green
*NL*
jaspers
that
are
found
near
Cuzco
and
give
forth
a
note
of
singular
*NL*
sweetness
.
He
had
painted
gourds
filled
with
pebbles
that
rattled
when
*NL*
they
were
shaken
;
the
long
_
clarin
_
of
the
Mexicans
,
into
which
the
*NL*
performer
does
not
blow
,
but
through
which
he
inhales
the
air
;
the
*NL*
harsh
_
ture
_
of
the
Amazon
tribes
,
that
is
sounded
by
the
sentinels
who
*NL*
sit
all
day
long
in
high
trees
,
and
can
be
heard
,
it
is
said
,
at
a
*NL*
distance
of
three
leagues
;
the
_
teponaztli
_
,
that
has
two
vibrating
*NL*
tongues
of
wood
and
is
beaten
with
sticks
that
are
smeared
with
an
*NL*
elastic
gum
obtained
from
the
milky
juice
of
plants
;
the
_
yotl
_
-
bells
of
*NL*
the
Aztecs
,
that
are
hung
in
clusters
like
grapes
;
and
a
huge
*NL*
cylindrical
drum
,
covered
with
the
skins
of
great
serpents
,
like
the
*NL*
one
that
Bernal
Diaz
saw
when
he
went
with
Cortes
into
the
Mexican
*NL*
temple
,
and
of
whose
doleful
sound
he
has
left
us
so
vivid
a
*NL*
description
.
The
fantastic
character
of
these
instruments
fascinated
*NL*
him
,
and
he
felt
a
curious
delight
in
the
thought
that
art
,
like
*NL*
Nature
,
has
her
monsters
,
things
of
bestial
shape
and
with
hideous
*NL*
voices
.
Yet
,
after
some
time
,
he
wearied
of
them
,
and
would
sit
in
his
*NL*
box
at
the
opera
,
either
alone
or
with
Lord
Henry
,
listening
in
rapt
*NL*
pleasure
to
``
Tannhauser
''
and
seeing
in
the
prelude
to
that
great
work
*NL*
of
art
a
presentation
of
the
tragedy
of
his
own
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
occasion
he
took
up
the
study
of
jewels
,
and
appeared
at
a
*NL*
costume
ball
as
Anne
de
Joyeuse
,
Admiral
of
France
,
in
a
dress
covered
*NL*
with
five
hundred
and
sixty
pearls
.
This
taste
enthralled
him
for
*NL*
years
,
and
,
indeed
,
may
be
said
never
to
have
left
him
.
He
would
often
*NL*
spend
a
whole
day
settling
and
resettling
in
their
cases
the
various
*NL*
stones
that
he
had
collected
,
such
as
the
olive-green
chrysoberyl
that
*NL*
turns
red
by
lamplight
,
the
cymophane
with
its
wirelike
line
of
silver
,
*NL*
the
pistachio-coloured
peridot
,
rose-pink
and
wine-yellow
topazes
,
*NL*
carbuncles
of
fiery
scarlet
with
tremulous
,
four-rayed
stars
,
flame-red
*NL*
cinnamon-stones
,
orange
and
violet
spinels
,
and
amethysts
with
their
*NL*
alternate
layers
of
ruby
and
sapphire
.
He
loved
the
red
gold
of
the
*NL*
sunstone
,
and
the
moonstone
's
pearly
whiteness
,
and
the
broken
rainbow
*NL*
of
the
milky
opal
.
He
procured
from
Amsterdam
three
emeralds
of
*NL*
extraordinary
size
and
richness
of
colour
,
and
had
a
turquoise
_
de
la
*NL*
vieille
roche
_
that
was
the
envy
of
all
the
connoisseurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
discovered
wonderful
stories
,
also
,
about
jewels
.
In
Alphonso
's
*NL*
Clericalis
Disciplina
a
serpent
was
mentioned
with
eyes
of
real
*NL*
jacinth
,
and
in
the
romantic
history
of
Alexander
,
the
Conqueror
of
*NL*
Emathia
was
said
to
have
found
in
the
vale
of
Jordan
snakes
``
with
*NL*
collars
of
real
emeralds
growing
on
their
backs
.
''
There
was
a
gem
in
*NL*
the
brain
of
the
dragon
,
Philostratus
told
us
,
and
``
by
the
exhibition
*NL*
of
golden
letters
and
a
scarlet
robe
''
the
monster
could
be
thrown
into
*NL*
a
magical
sleep
and
slain
.
According
to
the
great
alchemist
,
Pierre
de
*NL*
Boniface
,
the
diamond
rendered
a
man
invisible
,
and
the
agate
of
India
*NL*
made
him
eloquent
.
The
cornelian
appeased
anger
,
and
the
hyacinth
*NL*
provoked
sleep
,
and
the
amethyst
drove
away
the
fumes
of
wine
.
The
*NL*
garnet
cast
out
demons
,
and
the
hydropicus
deprived
the
moon
of
her
*NL*
colour
.
The
selenite
waxed
and
waned
with
the
moon
,
and
the
meloceus
,
*NL*
that
discovers
thieves
,
could
be
affected
only
by
the
blood
of
kids
.
*NL*
Leonardus
Camillus
had
seen
a
white
stone
taken
from
the
brain
of
a
*NL*
newly
killed
toad
,
that
was
a
certain
antidote
against
poison
.
The
*NL*
bezoar
,
that
was
found
in
the
heart
of
the
Arabian
deer
,
was
a
charm
*NL*
that
could
cure
the
plague
.
In
the
nests
of
Arabian
birds
was
the
*NL*
aspilates
,
that
,
according
to
Democritus
,
kept
the
wearer
from
any
*NL*
danger
by
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
King
of
Ceilan
rode
through
his
city
with
a
large
ruby
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
as
the
ceremony
of
his
coronation
.
The
gates
of
the
palace
of
John
the
*NL*
Priest
were
``
made
of
sardius
,
with
the
horn
of
the
horned
snake
*NL*
inwrought
,
so
that
no
man
might
bring
poison
within
.
''
Over
the
gable
*NL*
were
``
two
golden
apples
,
in
which
were
two
carbuncles
,
''
so
that
the
*NL*
gold
might
shine
by
day
and
the
carbuncles
by
night
.
In
Lodge
's
*NL*
strange
romance
'
A
Margarite
of
America
'
,
it
was
stated
that
in
the
*NL*
chamber
of
the
queen
one
could
behold
``
all
the
chaste
ladies
of
the
*NL*
world

How
exquisite

been

How
gorgeous
in

Even

Then
he
turned
his
attention
to
embroideries

tapestries
that
*NL*
performed
the
office
of
frescoes
in
the
chill
rooms
of
the
northern

nations

Europe

As
he
investigated
the
subject
--
and
he
always
had
*NL*
an
extraordinary
faculty
of
becoming
absolutely
absorbed
for
the
moment
*NL*
in
whatever
he
took
up
--
he
was
almost
saddened
by
the
reflection
of
the
*NL*
ruin
that
time
brought
on
beautiful
and
wonderful
things
.
He
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
,
had
escaped
that
.
Summer
followed
summer
,
and
the
yellow
*NL*
jonquils
bloomed
and
died
many
times
,
and
nights
of
horror
repeated
the
*NL*
story
of
their
shame
,
but
he
was
unchanged
.
No
winter
marred
his
face
*NL*
or
stained
his
flowerlike
bloom
.
How
different
it
was
with
material
*NL*
things
!
Where
had
they
passed
to
?
Where
was
the
great
crocus-coloured
*NL*
robe
,
on
which
the
gods
fought
against
the
giants
,
that
had
been
worked
*NL*
by
brown

for
the
pleasure
of
Athena

Where
the
huge
velarium

And
so
,
for

he
sought
to
accumulate
the
most
exquisite

specimens
that

could
find
of
textile

work

getting
*NL*
the

finely
wrought

stitched
over
with
iridescent
beetles

He
had
a
special
passion
,
also
,
for
ecclesiastical
vestments
,
as
indeed
*NL*
he
had
for
everything
connected
with
the
service
of
the
Church
.
In
the
*NL*
long
cedar
chests
that
lined
the
west
gallery
of
his
house
,
he
had
*NL*
stored
away
many
rare
and
beautiful
specimens
of
what
is
really
the
*NL*
raiment
of
the
Bride
of
Christ
,
who
must
wear
purple
and
jewels
and
*NL*
fine
linen
that
she
may
hide
the
pallid
macerated
body
that
is
worn
by
*NL*

suffering
that
she
seeks
for
and
wounded
by
self-inflicted
pain

He
possessed
a
gorgeous
cope
of
crimson
silk
and
gold-thread
damask
,
*NL*
figured
with
a
repeating
pattern
of
golden
pomegranates
set
in
*NL*
six-petalled
formal
blossoms
,
beyond
which
on
either
side
was
the
*NL*
pine-apple
device
wrought
in
seed-pearls
.
The
orphreys
were
divided
*NL*
into
panels
representing
scenes
from
the
life
of
the
Virgin
,
and
the
*NL*
coronation
of
the
Virgin
was
figured
in
coloured
silks
upon
the
hood
.
*NL*
This
was
Italian
work
of
the
fifteenth
century
.
Another
cope
was
of
*NL*
green
velvet
,
embroidered
with
heart-shaped
groups
of
acanthus-leaves
,
*NL*
from
which
spread
long-stemmed
white
blossoms
,
the
details
of
which
*NL*
were
picked
out
with
silver
thread
and
coloured
crystals
.
The
morse
*NL*
bore
a
seraph
's
head
in
gold-thread
raised
work
.
The
orphreys
were
*NL*
woven
in
a
diaper
of
red
and
gold
silk
,
and
were
starred
with
*NL*
medallions
of
many
saints
and
martyrs
,
among
whom
was
St.
Sebastian
.
*NL*
He
had
chasubles
,
also
,
of
amber-coloured
silk
,
and
blue
silk
and
gold
*NL*
brocade
,
and
yellow
silk
damask
and
cloth
of
gold
,
figured
with
*NL*
representations
of
the
Passion
and
Crucifixion
of
Christ
,
and
*NL*
embroidered
with
lions
and
peacocks
and
other
emblems
;
dalmatics
of
*NL*
white
satin
and
pink
silk
damask
,
decorated
with
tulips
and
dolphins
*NL*
and
_
fleurs-de-lis

;
altar
frontals
of
crimson
velvet
and
blue
linen
;
and
*NL*
many
corporals
,
chalice-veils
,
and
sudaria
.
In
the
mystic
offices
to
*NL*
which
such
things
were
put
,
there
was
something
that
quickened
his
*NL*
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
these
treasures
,
and
everything
that
he
collected
in
his
lovely
*NL*
house
,
were
to
be
to
him
means
of
forgetfulness
,
modes
by
which
he
*NL*
could
escape
,
for
a
season
,
from
the
fear
that
seemed
to
him
at
times
*NL*
to
be
almost
too
great
to
be
borne
.
Upon
the
walls
of
the
lonely
*NL*
locked
room
where
he
had
spent
so
much
of
his
boyhood
,
he
had
hung
with
*NL*
his
own
hands
the
terrible
portrait
whose
changing
features
showed
him
*NL*
the
real
degradation
of
his
life
,
and
in
front
of
it
had
draped
the
*NL*
purple-and-gold
pall
as
a
curtain
.
For
weeks
he
would
not
go
there
,
*NL*
would
forget
the
hideous
painted
thing
,
and
get
back
his
light
heart
,
*NL*
his
wonderful
joyousness
,
his
passionate
absorption
in
mere
existence
.
*NL*
Then
,
suddenly
,
some
night
he
would
creep
out
of
the
house
,
go
down
to
*NL*
dreadful
places
near
Blue
Gate
Fields
,
and
stay
there
,
day
after
day
,
*NL*
until
he
was
driven
away
.
On
his
return
he
would
sit
in
front
of
the
*NL*
picture
,
sometimes
loathing
it
and
himself
,
but
filled
,
at
other
*NL*
times
,
with
that
pride
of
individualism
that
is
half
the
*NL*
fascination
of
sin
,
and
smiling
with
secret
pleasure
at
the
misshapen
*NL*
shadow
that
had
to
bear
the
burden
that
should
have
been
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
years
he
could
not
endure
to
be
long
out
of
England
,
and
*NL*
gave
up
the
villa
that
he
had
shared
at
Trouville
with
Lord
Henry
,
as
*NL*
well
as
the
little
white
walled-in
house
at
Algiers
where
they
had
more
*NL*
than
once
spent
the
winter
.
He
hated
to
be
separated
from
the
picture
*NL*
that
was
such
a
part
of
his
life
,
and
was
also
afraid
that
during
his
*NL*
absence
some
one
might
gain
access
to
the
room
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
elaborate
bars
that
he
had
caused
to
be
placed
upon
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
quite
conscious
that
this
would
tell
them
nothing
.
It
was
true
*NL*
that
the
portrait
still
preserved
,
under
all
the
foulness
and
ugliness
*NL*
of
the
face
,
its
marked
likeness
to
himself
;
but
what
could
they
learn
*NL*
from
that
?
He
would
laugh
at
any
one
who
tried
to
taunt
him
.
He
had
*NL*
not
painted
it
.
What
was
it
to
him
how
vile
and
full
of
shame
it
*NL*
looked
?
Even
if
he
told
them
,
would
they
believe
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
was
afraid
.
Sometimes
when
he
was
down
at
his
great
house
in
*NL*
Nottinghamshire
,
entertaining
the
fashionable
young
men
of
his
own
rank
*NL*
who
were
his
chief
companions
,
and
astounding
the
county
by
the
wanton
*NL*
luxury
and
gorgeous
splendour
of
his
mode
of
life
,
he
would
suddenly
*NL*
leave
his
guests
and
rush
back
to
town
to
see
that
the
door
had
not
*NL*
been
tampered
with
and
that
the
picture
was
still
there
.
What
if
it
*NL*
should
be
stolen
?
The
mere
thought
made
him
cold
with
horror
.
Surely
*NL*
the
world
would
know
his
secret
then
.
Perhaps
the
world
already
*NL*
suspected
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
while
he
fascinated
many
,
there
were
not
a
few
who
distrusted
him
.
*NL*
He
was
very
nearly
blackballed
at
a
West
End
club
of
which
his
birth
*NL*
and
social
position
fully
entitled
him
to
become
a
member
,
and
it
was
*NL*
said
that
on
one
occasion
,
when
he
was
brought
by
a
friend
into
the
*NL*
smoking-room
of
the
Churchill
,
the
Duke
of
Berwick
and
another
*NL*
gentleman
got
up
in
a
marked
manner
and
went
out
.
Curious
stories
*NL*
became
current
about
him
after
he
had
passed
his
twenty-fifth
year
.
It
*NL*
was
rumoured
that
he
had
been
seen
brawling
with
foreign
sailors
in
a
*NL*
low
den
in
the
distant
parts
of
Whitechapel
,
and
that
he
consorted
with
*NL*
thieves
and
coiners
and
knew
the
mysteries
of
their
trade
.
His
*NL*
extraordinary
absences
became
notorious
,
and
,
when
he
used
to
reappear
*NL*
again
in
society
,
men
would
whisper
to
each
other
in
corners
,
or
pass
*NL*
him
with
a
sneer
,
or
look
at
him
with
cold
searching
eyes
,
as
though
*NL*
they
were
determined
to
discover
his
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
such
insolences
and
attempted
slights
he
,
of
course
,
took
no
notice
,
*NL*
and
in
the
opinion
of
most
people
his
frank
debonair
manner
,
his
*NL*
charming
boyish
smile
,
and
the
infinite
grace
of
that
wonderful
youth
*NL*
that
seemed
never
to
leave
him
,
were
in
themselves
a
sufficient
answer
*NL*
to
the
calumnies
,
for
so
they
termed
them
,
that
were
circulated
about
*NL*
him
.
It
was
remarked
,
however
,
that
some
of
those
who
had
been
most
*NL*
intimate
with
him
appeared
,
after
a
time
,
to
shun
him
.
Women
who
had
*NL*
wildly
adored
him
,
and
for
his
sake
had
braved
all
social
censure
and
*NL*
set
convention
at
defiance
,
were
seen
to
grow
pallid
with
shame
or
*NL*
horror
if
Dorian
Gray
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
these
whispered
scandals
only
increased
in
the
eyes
of
many
his
*NL*
strange
and
dangerous
charm
.
His
great
wealth
was
a
certain
element
of
*NL*
security
.
Society
--
civilized
society
,
at
least
--
is
never
very
ready
to
*NL*
believe
anything
to
the
detriment
of
those
who
are
both
rich
and
*NL*
fascinating
.
It
feels
instinctively
that
manners
are
of
more
*NL*
importance
than
morals
,
and
,
in
its
opinion
,
the
highest
respectability
*NL*
is
of
much
less
value
than
the
possession
of
a
good
_
chef
_
.
And
,
after
*NL*
all
,
it
is
a
very
poor
consolation
to
be
told
that
the
man
who
has
*NL*
given
one
a
bad
dinner
,
or
poor
wine
,
is
irreproachable
in
his
private
*NL*
life
.
Even
the
cardinal
virtues
can
not
atone
for
half-cold
_
entrees
_
,
as
*NL*
Lord
Henry
remarked
once
,
in
a
discussion
on
the
subject
,
and
there
is
*NL*
possibly
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
his
view
.
For
the
canons
of
good
*NL*
society
are
,
or
should
be
,
the
same
as
the
canons
of
art
.
Form
is
*NL*
absolutely
essential
to
it
.
It
should
have
the
dignity
of
a
ceremony
,
*NL*
as
well
as
its
unreality
,
and
should
combine
the
insincere
character
of
*NL*
a
romantic
play
with
the
wit
and
beauty
that
make
such
plays
delightful
*NL*
to
us
.
Is
insincerity
such
a
terrible
thing
?
I
think
not
.
It
is
*NL*
merely
a
method
by
which
we
can
multiply
our
personalities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
,
at
any
rate
,
was
Dorian
Gray
's
opinion
.
He
used
to
wonder
at
the
*NL*
shallow
psychology
of
those
who
conceive
the
ego
in
man
as
a
thing
*NL*
simple
,
permanent
,
reliable
,
and
of
one
essence
.
To
him
,
man
was
a
*NL*
being
with
myriad
lives
and
myriad
sensations
,
a
complex
multiform
*NL*
creature
that
bore
within
itself
strange
legacies
of
thought
and
*NL*
passion
,
and
whose
very
flesh
was
tainted
with
the
monstrous
maladies
*NL*
of
the
dead
.
He
loved
to
stroll
through
the
gaunt
cold
picture-gallery
*NL*
of
his
country
house
and
look
at
the
various
portraits
of
those
whose
*NL*
blood
flowed
in
his
veins
.
Here
was
Philip
Herbert
,
described
by
*NL*
Francis
Osborne
,
in
his
Memoires
on
the
Reigns
of
Queen
Elizabeth
and
*NL*
King
James
,
as
one
who
was
``
caressed
by
the
Court
for
his
handsome
*NL*
face
,
which
kept
him
not
long
company
.
''
Was
it
young
Herbert
's
life
*NL*
that
he
sometimes
led
?
Had
some
strange
poisonous
germ
crept
from
body
*NL*
to
body
till
it
had
reached
his
own
?
Was
it
some
dim
sense
of
that
*NL*
ruined
grace
that
had
made
him
so
suddenly
,
and
almost
without
cause
,
*NL*
give
utterance
,
in
Basil
Hallward
's
studio
,
to
the
mad
prayer
that
had
*NL*
so
changed
his
life
?
Here
,
in
gold-embroidered
red
doublet
,
jewelled
*NL*
surcoat
,
and
gilt-edged
ruff
and
wristbands
,
stood
Sir
Anthony
Sherard
,
*NL*
with
his
silver-and-black
armour
piled
at
his
feet
.
What
had
this
*NL*
man
's
legacy
been
?
Had
the
lover
of
Giovanna
of
Naples
bequeathed
him
*NL*
some
inheritance
of
sin
and
shame
?
Were
his
own
actions
merely
the
*NL*
dreams
that
the
dead
man
had
not
dared
to
realize
?
Here
,
from
the
*NL*
fading
canvas
,
smiled
Lady
Elizabeth
Devereux
,
in
her
gauze
hood
,
pearl
*NL*
stomacher
,
and
pink
slashed
sleeves
.
A
flower
was
in
her
right
hand
,
*NL*
and
her
left
clasped
an
enamelled
collar
of
white
and
damask
roses
.
On
*NL*
a
table
by
her
side
lay
a
mandolin
and
an
apple
.
There
were
large
*NL*
green
rosettes
upon
her
little
pointed
shoes
.
He
knew
her
life
,
and
*NL*
the
strange
stories
that
were
told
about
her
lovers
.
Had
he
something
*NL*
of
her
temperament
in
him
?
These
oval
,
heavy-lidded
eyes
seemed
to
*NL*
look
curiously
at
him
.
What
of
George
Willoughby
,
with
his
powdered
*NL*
hair
and
fantastic
patches
?
How
evil
he
looked
!
The
face
was
*NL*
saturnine
and
swarthy
,
and
the
sensual
lips
seemed
to
be
twisted
with
*NL*
disdain
.
Delicate
lace
ruffles
fell
over
the
lean
yellow
hands
that
*NL*
were
so
overladen
with
rings
.
He
had
been
a
macaroni
of
the
eighteenth
*NL*
century
,
and
the
friend
,
in
his
youth
,
of
Lord
Ferrars
.
What
of
the
*NL*
second
Lord
Beckenham
,
the
companion
of
the
Prince
Regent
in
his
*NL*
wildest
days
,
and
one
of
the
witnesses
at
the
secret
marriage
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Fitzherbert
?
How
proud
and
handsome
he
was
,
with
his
chestnut
curls
*NL*
and
insolent
pose
!
What
passions
had
he
bequeathed
?
The
world
had
*NL*
looked
upon
him
as
infamous
.
He
had
led
the
orgies
at
Carlton
House
.
*NL*
The
star
of
the
Garter
glittered
upon
his
breast
.
Beside
him
hung
the
*NL*
portrait
of
his
wife
,
a
pallid
,
thin-lipped
woman
in
black
.
Her
blood
,
*NL*
also
,
stirred
within
him
.
How
curious
it
all
seemed
!
And
his
mother
*NL*
with
her
Lady
Hamilton
face
and
her
moist
,
wine-dashed
lips
--
he
knew
*NL*
what
he
had
got
from
her
.
He
had
got
from
her
his
beauty
,
and
his
*NL*
passion
for
the
beauty
of
others
.
She
laughed
at
him
in
her
loose
*NL*
Bacchante
dress
.
There
were
vine
leaves
in
her
hair
.
The
purple
*NL*
spilled
from
the
cup
she
was
holding
.
The
carnations
of
the
painting
*NL*
had
withered
,
but
the
eyes
were
still
wonderful
in
their
depth
and
*NL*
brilliancy
of
colour
.
They
seemed
to
follow
him
wherever
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
one
had
ancestors
in
literature
as
well
as
in
one
's
own
race
,
*NL*
nearer
perhaps
in
type
and
temperament
,
many
of
them
,
and
certainly
*NL*
with
an
influence
of
which
one
was
more
absolutely
conscious
.
There
*NL*
were
times
when
it
appeared
to
Dorian
Gray
that
the
whole
of
history
*NL*
was
merely
the
record
of
his
own
life
,
not
as
he
had
lived
it
in
act
*NL*
and
circumstance
,
but
as
his
imagination
had
created
it
for
him
,
as
it
*NL*
had
been
in
his
brain
and
in
his
passions
.
He
felt
that
he
had
known
*NL*
them
all
,
those
strange
terrible
figures
that
had
passed
across
the
*NL*
stage
of
the
world
and
made
sin
so
marvellous
and
evil
so
full
of
*NL*
subtlety
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
in
some
mysterious
way
their
lives
had
*NL*
been
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hero
of
the
wonderful
novel
that
had
so
influenced
his
life
had
*NL*
himself
known
this
curious
fancy
.
In
the
seventh
chapter
he
tells
how
,
*NL*
crowned
with
laurel
,
lest
lightning
might
strike
him
,
he
had
sat
,
as
*NL*
Tiberius
,
in
a
garden
at
Capri
,
reading
the
shameful
books
of
*NL*
Elephantis
,
while
dwarfs
and
peacocks
strutted
round
him
and
the
*NL*
flute-player
mocked
the
swinger
of
the
censer
;
and
,
as
Caligula
,
had
*NL*
caroused
with
the
green-shirted
jockeys
in
their
stables
and
supped
in
*NL*
an
ivory
manger
with
a
jewel-frontleted
horse
;
and
,
as
Domitian
,
had
*NL*
wandered
through
a
corridor
lined
with
marble
mirrors
,
looking
round
*NL*
with
haggard
eyes
for
the
reflection
of
the
dagger
that
was
to
end
his
*NL*
days
,
and
sick
with
that
ennui
,
that
terrible
_
taedium
vitae
_
,
that
comes
*NL*
on
those
to
whom
life
denies
nothing
;
and
had
peered
through
a
clear
*NL*
emerald
at
the
red
shambles
of
the
circus
and
then
,
in
a
litter
of
*NL*
pearl
and
purple
drawn
by
silver-shod
mules
,
been
carried
through
the
*NL*
Street
of
Pomegranates
to
a
House
of
Gold
and
heard
men
cry
on
Nero
*NL*
Caesar
as
he
passed
by
;
and
,
as
Elagabalus
,
had
painted
his
face
with
*NL*
colours
,
and
plied
the
distaff
among
the
women
,
and
brought
the
Moon
*NL*
from
Carthage
and
given
her
in
mystic
marriage
to
the
Sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
and
over
again
Dorian
used
to
read
this
fantastic
chapter
,
and
the
*NL*
two
chapters
immediately
following
,
in
which
,
as
in
some
curious
*NL*
tapestries
or
cunningly
wrought
enamels
,
were
pictured
the
awful
and
*NL*
beautiful
forms
of
those
whom
vice
and
blood
and
weariness
had
made
*NL*
monstrous
or
mad
:
Filippo
,
Duke
of
Milan
,
who
slew
his
wife
and
*NL*
painted
her
lips
with
a
scarlet
poison
that
her
lover
might
suck
death
*NL*
from
the
dead
thing
he
fondled
;
Pietro
Barbi
,
the
Venetian
,
known
as
*NL*
Paul
the
Second
,
who
sought
in
his
vanity
to
assume
the
title
of
*NL*
Formosus
,
and
whose
tiara
,
valued
at
two
hundred
thousand
florins
,
was
*NL*
bought
at
the
price
of
a
terrible
sin
;
Gian
Maria
Visconti
,
who
used
*NL*
hounds
to
chase
living
men
and
whose
murdered
body
was
covered
with
*NL*
roses
by
a
harlot
who
had
loved
him
;
the
Borgia
on
his
white
horse
,
*NL*
with
Fratricide
riding
beside
him
and
his
mantle
stained
with
the
blood
*NL*
of
Perotto
;
Pietro
Riario
,
the
young
Cardinal
Archbishop
of
Florence
,
*NL*
child
and
minion
of
Sixtus
IV
,
whose
beauty
was
equalled
only
by
his
*NL*
debauchery
,
and
who
received
Leonora
of
Aragon
in
a
pavilion
of
white
*NL*
and
crimson
silk
,
filled
with
nymphs
and
centaurs
,
and
gilded
a
boy
*NL*
that
he
might
serve
at
the
feast
as
Ganymede
or
Hylas
;
Ezzelin
,
whose
*NL*
melancholy
could
be
cured
only
by
the
spectacle
of
death
,
and
who
had
a
*NL*
passion
for
red
blood
,
as
other
men
have
for
red
wine
--
the
son
of
the
*NL*
Fiend
,
as
was
reported
,
and
one
who
had
cheated
his
father
at
dice
when
*NL*
gambling
with
him
for
his
own
soul
;
Giambattista
Cibo
,
who
in
mockery
*NL*
took
the
name
of
Innocent
and
into
whose
torpid
veins
the
blood
of
*NL*
three
lads
was
infused
by
a
Jewish
doctor
;
Sigismondo
Malatesta
,
the
*NL*
lover
of
Isotta
and
the
lord
of
Rimini
,
whose
effigy
was
burned
at
Rome
*NL*
as
the
enemy
of
God
and
man
,
who
strangled
Polyssena
with
a
napkin
,
and
*NL*
gave
poison
to
Ginevra
d'Este
in
a
cup
of
emerald
,
and
in
honour
of
a
*NL*
shameful
passion
built
a
pagan
church
for
Christian
worship
;
Charles
*NL*
VI
,
who
had
so
wildly
adored
his
brother
's
wife
that
a
leper
had
warned
*NL*
him
of
the
insanity
that
was
coming
on
him
,
and
who
,
when
his
brain
had
*NL*
sickened
and
grown
strange
,
could
only
be
soothed
by
Saracen
cards
*NL*
painted
with
the
images
of
love
and
death
and
madness
;
and
,
in
his
*NL*
trimmed
jerkin
and
jewelled
cap
and
acanthuslike
curls
,
Grifonetto
*NL*
Baglioni
,
who
slew
Astorre
with
his
bride
,
and
Simonetto
with
his
page
,
*NL*
and
whose
comeliness
was
such
that
,
as
he
lay
dying
in
the
yellow
*NL*
piazza
of
Perugia
,
those
who
had
hated
him
could
not
choose
but
weep
,
*NL*
and
Atalanta
,
who
had
cursed
him
,
blessed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
horrible
fascination
in
them
all
.
He
saw
them
at
night
,
*NL*
and
they
troubled
his
imagination
in
the
day
.
The
Renaissance
knew
of
*NL*
strange
manners
of
poisoning
--
poisoning
by
a
helmet
and
a
lighted
*NL*
torch
,
by
an
embroidered
glove
and
a
jewelled
fan
,
by
a
gilded
pomander
*NL*
and
by
an
amber
chain
.
Dorian
Gray
had
been
poisoned
by
a
book
.
There
*NL*
were
moments
when
he
looked
on
evil
simply
as
a
mode
through
which
he
*NL*
could
realize
his
conception
of
the
beautiful
.

CHAPTER
12
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
ninth
of
November
,
the
eve
of
his
own
thirty-eighth
*NL*
birthday
,
as
he
often
remembered
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
walking
home
about
eleven
o'clock
from
Lord
Henry
's
,
where
he
*NL*
had
been
dining
,
and
was
wrapped
in
heavy
furs
,
as
the
night
was
cold
*NL*
and
foggy
.
At
the
corner
of
Grosvenor
Square
and
South
Audley
Street
,
*NL*
a
man
passed
him
in
the
mist
,
walking
very
fast
and
with
the
collar
of
*NL*
his
grey
ulster
turned
up
.
He
had
a
bag
in
his
hand
.
Dorian
*NL*
recognized
him
.
It
was
Basil
Hallward
.
A
strange
sense
of
fear
,
for
*NL*
which
he
could
not
account
,
came
over
him
.
He
made
no
sign
of
*NL*
recognition
and
went
on
quickly
in
the
direction
of
his
own
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Hallward
had
seen
him
.
Dorian
heard
him
first
stopping
on
the
*NL*
pavement
and
then
hurrying
after
him
.
In
a
few
moments
,
his
hand
was
*NL*
on
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
!
What
an
extraordinary
piece
of
luck
!
I
have
been
waiting
for
*NL*
you
in
your
library
ever
since
nine
o'clock
.
Finally
I
took
pity
on
*NL*
your
tired
servant
and
told
him
to
go
to
bed
,
as
he
let
me
out
.
I
am
*NL*
off
to
Paris
by
the
midnight
train
,
and
I
particularly
wanted
to
see
*NL*
you
before
I
left
.
I
thought
it
was
you
,
or
rather
your
fur
coat
,
as
*NL*
you
passed
me
.
But
I
was
n't
quite
sure
.
Did
n't
you
recognize
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
fog
,
my
dear
Basil
?
Why
,
I
ca
n't
even
recognize
Grosvenor
*NL*
Square
.
I
believe
my
house
is
somewhere
about
here
,
but
I
do
n't
feel
*NL*
at
all
certain
about
it
.
I
am
sorry
you
are
going
away
,
as
I
have
not
*NL*
seen
you
for
ages
.
But
I
suppose
you
will
be
back
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
I
am
going
to
be
out
of
England
for
six
months

I
intend
to
take
*NL*
a
studio
in
Paris
and
shut
myself
up
till
I
have
finished
a
great
*NL*
picture
I
have
in
my
head

However
,
it
was
n't
about
myself
I
wanted
to
*NL*
talk

Here
we
are
at
your
door

Let
me
come
in
for
a
moment

I
have
*NL*
something
to
say

you

*NL*
``
I
shall
be
charmed

?
''
said
Dorian
Gray
*NL*
languidly
as
he
passed
up
the
steps
and
opened
the
door
with
his
*NL*
latch-key
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lamplight
struggled
out
through
the
fog
,
and
Hallward
looked
at
his
*NL*
watch
.
``
I
have
heaps
of
time
,
''
he
answered
.
``
The
train
does
n't
go
*NL*
till
twelve-fifteen
,
and
it
is
only
just
eleven
.
In
fact
,
I
was
on
my
*NL*
way
to
the
club
to
look
for
you
,
when
I
met
you
.
You
see
,
I
sha
n't
*NL*
have
any
delay
about
luggage
,
as
I
have
sent
on
my
heavy
things
.
All
I
*NL*
have
with
me
is
in
this
bag
,
and
I
can
easily
get
to
Victoria
in
twenty
*NL*
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
looked
at
him
and
smiled
.
``
What
a
way
for
a
fashionable
painter
*NL*
to
travel
!
A
Gladstone
bag
and
an
ulster
!
Come
in
,
or
the
fog
will
*NL*
get
into
the
house
.
And
mind
you
do
n't
talk
about
anything
serious
.
*NL*
Nothing
is
serious
nowadays
.
At
least
nothing
should
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
shook
his
head
,
as
he
entered
,
and
followed
Dorian
into
the
*NL*
library
.
There
was
a
bright
wood
fire
blazing
in
the
large
open
*NL*
hearth
.
The
lamps
were
lit
,
and
an
open
Dutch
silver
spirit-case
*NL*
stood
,
with
some
siphons
of
soda-water
and
large
cut-glass
tumblers
,
on
*NL*
a
little
marqueterie
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
your
servant
made
me
quite
at
home
,
Dorian
.
He
gave
me
*NL*
everything
I
wanted
,
including
your
best
gold-tipped
cigarettes
.
He
is
*NL*
a
most
hospitable
creature
.
I
like
him
much
better
than
the
Frenchman
*NL*
you
used
to
have
.
What
has
become
of
the
Frenchman
,
by
the
bye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
I
believe
he
married
Lady
Radley
's
*NL*
maid
,
and
has
established
her
in
Paris
as
an
English
dressmaker
.
*NL*
Anglomania
is
very
fashionable
over
there
now
,
I
hear
.
It
seems
silly
*NL*
of
the
French
,
does
n't
it
?
But
--
do
you
know
?
--
he
was
not
at
all
a
bad
*NL*
servant
.
I
never
liked
him
,
but
I
had
nothing
to
complain
about
.
One
*NL*
often
imagines
things
that
are
quite
absurd
.
He
was
really
very
*NL*
devoted
to
me
and
seemed
quite
sorry
when
he
went
away
.
Have
another
*NL*
brandy-and-soda
?
Or
would
you
like
hock-and-seltzer
?
I
always
take
*NL*
hock-and-seltzer
myself
.
There
is
sure
to
be
some
in
the
next
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
I
wo
n't
have
anything
more
,
''
said
the
painter
,
taking
his
cap
*NL*
and
coat
off
and
throwing
them
on
the
bag
that
he
had
placed
in
the
*NL*
corner
.
``
And
now
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
want
to
speak
to
you
seriously
.
*NL*
Do
n't
frown
like
that
.
You
make
it
so
much
more
difficult
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
all
about
?
''
cried
Dorian
in
his
petulant
way
,
flinging
*NL*
himself
down
on
the
sofa
.
``
I
hope
it
is
not
about
myself
.
I
am
tired
*NL*
of
myself
to-night
.
I
should
like
to
be
somebody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
about
yourself
,
''
answered
Hallward
in
his
grave
deep
voice
,
``
and
*NL*
I
must
say
it
to
you
.
I
shall
only
keep
you
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
sighed
and
lit
a
cigarette
.
``
Half
an
hour
!
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
much
to
ask
of
you
,
Dorian
,
and
it
is
entirely
for
your
own
*NL*
sake
that
I
am
speaking
.
I
think
it
right
that
you
should
know
that
*NL*
the
most
dreadful
things
are
being
said
against
you
in
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
know
anything
about
them
.
I
love
scandals
about
other
*NL*
people
,
but
scandals
about
myself
do
n't
interest
me
.
They
have
not
got
*NL*
the
charm
of
novelty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
must
interest
you
,
Dorian
.
Every
gentleman
is
interested
in
his
*NL*
good
name
.
You
do
n't
want
people
to
talk
of
you
as
something
vile
and
*NL*
degraded
.
Of
course
,
you
have
your
position
,
and
your
wealth
,
and
all
*NL*
that
kind
of
thing
.
But
position
and
wealth
are
not
everything
.
Mind
*NL*
you
,
I
do
n't
believe
these
rumours
at
all
.
At
least
,
I
ca
n't
believe
*NL*
them
when
I
see
you
.
Sin
is
a
thing
that
writes
itself
across
a
man
's
*NL*
face
.
It
can
not
be
concealed
.
People
talk
sometimes
of
secret
vices
.
*NL*
There
are
no
such
things
.
If
a
wretched
man
has
a
vice
,
it
shows
*NL*
itself
in
the
lines
of
his
mouth
,
the
droop
of
his
eyelids
,
the
*NL*
moulding
of
his
hands
even
.
Somebody
--
I
wo
n't
mention
his
name
,
but
*NL*
you
know
him
--
came
to
me
last
year
to
have
his
portrait
done
.
I
had
*NL*
never
seen
him
before
,
and
had
never
heard
anything
about
him
at
the
*NL*
time
,
though
I
have
heard
a
good
deal
since
.
He
offered
an
extravagant
*NL*
price
.
I
refused
him
.
There
was
something
in
the
shape
of
his
fingers
*NL*
that
I
hated
.
I
know
now
that
I
was
quite
right
in
what
I
fancied
*NL*
about
him
.
His
life
is
dreadful
.
But
you
,
Dorian
,
with
your
pure
,
*NL*
bright
,
innocent
face
,
and
your
marvellous
untroubled
youth
--
I
ca
n't
*NL*
believe
anything
against
you
.
And
yet
I
see
you
very
seldom
,
and
you
*NL*
never
come
down
to
the
studio
now
,
and
when
I
am
away
from
you
,
and
I
*NL*
hear
all
these
hideous
things
that
people
are
whispering
about
you
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
to
say
.
Why
is
it
,
Dorian
,
that
a
man
like
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Berwick
leaves
the
room
of
a
club
when
you
enter
it
?
Why
is
it
that
so
*NL*
many
gentlemen
in
London
will
neither
go
to
your
house
or
invite
you
to
*NL*
theirs
?
You
used
to
be
a
friend
of
Lord
Staveley
.
I
met
him
at
dinner
*NL*
last
week
.
Your
name
happened
to
come
up
in
conversation
,
in
*NL*
connection
with
the
miniatures
you
have
lent
to
the
exhibition
at
the
*NL*
Dudley
.
Staveley
curled
his
lip
and
said
that
you
might
have
the
most
*NL*
artistic
tastes
,
but
that
you
were
a
man
whom
no
pure-minded
girl
*NL*
should
be
allowed
to
know
,
and
whom
no
chaste
woman
should
sit
in
the
*NL*
same
room
with
.
I
reminded
him
that
I
was
a
friend
of
yours
,
and
asked
*NL*
him
what
he
meant
.
He
told
me
.
He
told
me
right
out
before
everybody
.
*NL*
It
was
horrible
!
Why
is
your
friendship
so
fatal
to
young
men
?
There
*NL*
was
that
wretched
boy
in
the
Guards
who
committed
suicide
.
You
were
*NL*
his
great
friend
.
There
was
Sir
Henry
Ashton
,
who
had
to
leave
England
*NL*
with
a
tarnished
name
.
You
and
he
were
inseparable
.
What
about
Adrian
*NL*
Singleton
and
his
dreadful
end
?
What
about
Lord
Kent
's
only
son
and
*NL*
his
career
?
I
met
his
father
yesterday
in
St.
James
's
Street
.
He
*NL*
seemed
broken
with
shame
and
sorrow
.
What
about
the
young
Duke
of
*NL*
Perth
?
What
sort
of
life
has
he
got
now
?
What
gentleman
would
*NL*
associate
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
Basil
.
You
are
talking
about
things
of
which
you
know
nothing

''
*NL*
said
Dorian
Gray
,
biting
his
lip
,
and
with
a
note
of
infinite
contempt
*NL*
in
his
voice
.
``
You
ask
me
why
Berwick
leaves
a
room
when
I
enter
it
.
*NL*
It
is
because
I
know
everything
about
his
life
,
not
because
he
knows
*NL*
anything
about
mine
.
With
such
blood
as
he
has
in
his
veins
,
how
could
*NL*
his
record
be
clean
?
You
ask
me
about
Henry
Ashton
and
young
Perth
.
*NL*
Did
I
teach
the
one
his
vices
,
and
the
other
his
debauchery
?
If
Kent
's
*NL*
silly
son
takes
his
wife
from
the
streets
,
what
is
that
to
me
?
If
*NL*
Adrian
Singleton
writes
his
friend
's
name
across
a
bill
,
am
I
his
*NL*
keeper
?
I
know
how
people
chatter
in
England
.
The
middle
classes
air
*NL*
their
moral
prejudices
over
their
gross
dinner-tables
,
and
whisper
*NL*
about
what
they
call
the
profligacies
of
their
betters
in
order
to
try
*NL*
and
pretend
that
they
are
in
smart
society
and
on
intimate
terms
with
*NL*
the
people
they
slander
.
In
this
country
,
it
is
enough
for
a
man
to
*NL*
have
distinction
and
brains
for
every
common
tongue
to
wag
against
him
.
*NL*
And
what
sort
of
lives
do
these
people
,
who
pose
as
being
moral
,
lead
*NL*
themselves
?
My
dear
fellow
,
you
forget
that
we
are
in
the
native
land
*NL*
of
the
hypocrite
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian

''
cried
Hallward
,
``
that
is
not
the
question

England
is
bad

enough

English
society

That
is
the
reason
*NL*
why
I
want
you

You

One
has
a
right
to
*NL*
judge
of
a

by
the
effect

has
over
his
friends

Yours
seem
to
*NL*
lose
all
sense
of
honour

of
goodness

of
purity

You
have
filled
them
*NL*
with
a
madness
for
pleasure

gone
down
into
the
depths

You
*NL*

Yes
:
you
led
them
there
,
and
yet
you
can
smile

as
*NL*
you
are
smiling
now

And
there
is
worse
behind

I
know
you
and
Harry
*NL*
are
inseparable

Surely
for
that
reason
,
if
for
none
other

you
should
*NL*
not

made
his
sister

name
a
by-word

``
Take
care

Basil

You

too
far

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must

You
shall
listen

When
you
met
*NL*
Lady
Gwendolen
,
not
a
breath
of
scandal
had
ever
touched
her
.
Is
there
*NL*
a
single
decent
woman
in
London
now
who
would
drive
with
her
in
the
*NL*
park
?
Why
,
even
her
children
are
not
allowed
to
live
with
her
.
Then
*NL*
there
are
other
stories
--
stories
that
you
have
been
seen
creeping
at
*NL*
dawn
out
of
dreadful
houses
and
slinking
in
disguise
into
the
foulest
*NL*
dens
in
London
.
Are
they
true

Can
they
be
true

When
I
first
heard
*NL*
them
,
I
laughed
.
I
hear
them
now

and
they
make
me
shudder

What
*NL*
about
your
country-house
and
the
life
that
is
led
there

Dorian
,
you
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
is
said
about
you
.
I
wo
n't
tell
you
that
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
preach
to
you
.
I
remember
Harry
saying
once
that
every
man
who
*NL*
turned
himself
into
an
amateur
curate
for
the
moment
always
began
by
*NL*
saying
that
,
and
then
proceeded
to
break
his
word
.
I
do
want
to
preach
*NL*
to
you
.
I
want
you
to
lead
such
a
life
as
will
make
the
world
respect
*NL*
you
.
I
want
you
to
have
a
clean
name
and
a
fair
record
.
I
want
you
to
*NL*
get
rid
of
the
dreadful
people
you
associate
with
.
Do
n't
shrug
your
*NL*
shoulders
like
that

Do
n't
be
so
indifferent
.
You
have
a
wonderful
*NL*
influence
.
Let
it
be
for
good
,
not
for
evil

They
say
that
you
*NL*
corrupt
every
one
with
whom
you
become
intimate
,
and
that
it
is
quite
*NL*
sufficient
for
you
to
enter
a
house
for
shame
of
some
kind
to
follow
*NL*
after
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
is
so

not

How
should
I
know
?
But
*NL*
it
is
said
of
you
.
I
am
told
things
that
it
seems
impossible
to
doubt
.
*NL*
Lord
Gloucester
was
one
of
my
greatest
friends
at
Oxford
.
He
showed
me
*NL*
a
letter
that
his
wife
had
written
to
him
when
she
was
dying
alone
in
*NL*
her
villa
at
Mentone
.
Your
name
was
implicated
in
the
most
terrible
*NL*
confession
I
ever
read
.
I
told
him
that
it
was
absurd
--
that
I
knew
you
*NL*
thoroughly
and
that
you
were
incapable
of
anything
of
the
kind
.
Know
*NL*
you
?
I
wonder
do
I
know
you
?
Before
I
could
answer
that
,
I
should
*NL*
have
to
see
your
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
my
soul
!
''
muttered
Dorian
Gray
,
starting
up
from
the
sofa
and
*NL*
turning
almost
white
from
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Hallward
gravely
,
and
with
deep-toned
sorrow
in
his
*NL*
voice
,
``
to
see
your
soul
.
But
only
God
can
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bitter
laugh
of
mockery
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
younger
man
.
``
You
*NL*
shall
see
it
yourself
,
to-night
!
''
he
cried
,
seizing
a
lamp
from
the
*NL*
table
.
``
Come
:
it
is
your
own
handiwork

Why
should
n't
you
look
at

it

You
can
tell
the

all
about
it
afterwards

if
you
choose

Nobody

If

did

they
would
like

I
know
the
age
better
than
you
do

though
you
*NL*
will
prate
about
it
so
tediously

Come

I
tell
you

You
have
*NL*
chattered
enough
about
corruption

Now
you
shall
look
on
it
face
to
*NL*
face

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
madness
of
pride
in
every
word
he
uttered
.
He
stamped
*NL*
his
foot
upon
the
ground
in
his
boyish
insolent
manner
.
He
felt
a
*NL*
terrible
joy
at
the
thought
that
some
one
else
was
to
share
his
secret
,
*NL*
and
that
the
man
who
had
painted
the
portrait
that
was
the
origin
of
*NL*
all
his
shame
was
to
be
burdened
for
the
rest
of
his
life
with
the
*NL*
hideous
memory
of
what
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
continued
,
coming
closer
to
him
and
looking
steadfastly
into
*NL*
his
stern
eyes
,
``
I
shall
show
you
my
soul
.
You
shall
see
the
thing
*NL*
that
you
fancy
only
God
can
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
started
back
.
``
This
is
blasphemy
,
Dorian
!
''
he
cried
.
``
You
*NL*
must
not
say
things
like
that
.
They
are
horrible
,
and
they
do
n't
mean
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
so
?
''
He
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
so
.
As
for
what
I
said
to
you
to-night
,
I
said
it
for
your
*NL*
good
.
You
know
I
have
been
always
a
stanch
friend
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
me
.
Finish
what
you
have
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
twisted
flash
of
pain
shot
across
the
painter
's
face
.
He
paused
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
and
a
wild
feeling
of
pity
came
over
him
.
After
all
,
what
*NL*
right
had
he
to
pry
into
the
life
of
Dorian
Gray
?
If
he
had
done
a
*NL*
tithe
of
what
was
rumoured
about
him
,
how
much
he
must
have
suffered
!
*NL*
Then
he
straightened
himself
up
,
and
walked
over
to
the
fire-place
,
and
*NL*
stood
there
,
looking
at
the
burning
logs
with
their
frostlike
ashes
and
*NL*
their
throbbing
cores
of
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
waiting
,
Basil
,
''
said
the
young
man
in
a
hard
clear
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
.
``
What
I
have
to
say
is
this
,
''
he
cried
.
``
You
must
*NL*
give
me
some
answer
to
these
horrible
charges
that
are
made
against
*NL*
you
.
If
you
tell
me
that
they
are
absolutely
untrue
from
beginning
to
*NL*
end
,
I
shall
believe
you
.
Deny
them
,
Dorian
,
deny
them
!
Ca
n't
you
see
*NL*
what
I
am
going
through
?
My
God
!
do
n't
tell
me
that
you
are
bad
,
and
*NL*
corrupt
,
and
shameful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
smiled
.
There
was
a
curl
of
contempt
in
his
lips
.
``
Come
*NL*
upstairs
,
Basil
,
''
he
said
quietly
.
``
I
keep
a
diary
of
my
life
from
day
*NL*
to
day
,
and
it
never
leaves
the
room
in
which
it
is
written
.
I
shall
*NL*
show
it
to
you
if
you
come
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
with
you
,
Dorian
,
if
you
wish
it
.
I
see
I
have
missed
my
*NL*
train
.
That
makes
no
matter
.
I
can
go
to-morrow
.
But
do
n't
ask
me
to
*NL*
read
anything
to-night
.
All
I
want
is
a
plain
answer
to
my
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
shall
be
given
to
you
upstairs
.
I
could
not
give
it
here
.
You
*NL*
will
not
have
to
read
long

CHAPTER
13
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
out
of
the
room
and
began
the
ascent
,
Basil
Hallward
*NL*
following
close
behind
.
They
walked
softly
,
as
men
do
instinctively
at
*NL*
night
.
The
lamp
cast
fantastic
shadows
on
the
wall
and
staircase
.
A
*NL*
rising
wind
made
some
of
the
windows
rattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
top
landing
,
Dorian
set
the
lamp
down
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
and
taking
out
the
key
,
turned
it
in
the
lock
.
``
You
insist
on
*NL*
knowing
,
Basil
?
''
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
delighted
,
''
he
answered
,
smiling
.
Then
he
added
,
somewhat
*NL*
harshly
,
``
You
are
the
one
man
in
the
world
who
is
entitled
to
know
*NL*
everything
about
me
.
You
have
had
more
to
do
with
my
life
than
you
*NL*
think
''
;
and
,
taking
up
the
lamp
,
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
.
A
*NL*
cold
current
of
air
passed
them
,
and
the
light
shot
up
for
a
moment
in
*NL*
a
flame
of
murky
orange
.
He
shuddered
.
``
Shut
the
door
behind
you
,
''
he
*NL*
whispered
,
as
he
placed
the
lamp
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
glanced
round
him
with
a
puzzled
expression
.
The
room
looked
*NL*
as
if
it
had
not
been
lived
in
for
years
.
A
faded
Flemish
tapestry
,
a
*NL*
curtained
picture
,
an
old
Italian
_
cassone
_
,
and
an
almost
empty
*NL*
book-case
--
that
was
all
that
it
seemed
to
contain
,
besides
a
chair
and
*NL*
a
table
.
As
Dorian
Gray
was
lighting
a
half-burned
candle
that
was
*NL*
standing
on
the
mantelshelf
,
he
saw
that
the
whole
place
was
covered
*NL*
with
dust
and
that
the
carpet
was
in
holes
.
A
mouse
ran
scuffling
*NL*
behind
the
wainscoting
.
There
was
a
damp
odour
of
mildew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
think
that
it
is
only
God
who
sees
the
soul
,
Basil
?
Draw
that
*NL*
curtain
back
,
and
you
will
see
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
that
spoke
was
cold
and
cruel
.
``
You
are
mad
,
Dorian
,
or
*NL*
playing
a
part
,
''
muttered
Hallward
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
?
Then
I
must
do
it
myself
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
and
he
tore
*NL*
the
curtain
from
its
rod
and
flung
it
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
exclamation
of
horror
broke
from
the
painter
's
lips
as
he
saw
in
the
*NL*
dim
light
the
hideous
face
on
the
canvas
grinning
at
him
.
There
was
*NL*
something
in
its
expression
that
filled
him
with
disgust
and
loathing
.
*NL*
Good
heavens
!
it
was
Dorian
Gray
's
own
face
that
he
was
looking
at
!
*NL*
The
horror
,
whatever
it
was
,
had
not
yet
entirely
spoiled
that
*NL*
marvellous
beauty
.
There
was
still
some
gold
in
the
thinning
hair
and
*NL*
some
scarlet
on
the
sensual
mouth
.
The
sodden
eyes
had
kept
something
*NL*
of
the
loveliness
of
their
blue
,
the
noble
curves
had
not
yet
*NL*
completely
passed
away
from
chiselled
nostrils
and
from
plastic
throat
.
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
Dorian
himself
.
But
who
had
done
it
?
He
seemed
to
*NL*
recognize
his
own
brushwork
,
and
the
frame
was
his
own
design
.
The
*NL*
idea
was
monstrous
,
yet
he
felt
afraid
.
He
seized
the
lighted
candle
,
*NL*
and
held
it
to
the
picture
.
In
the
left-hand
corner
was
his
own
name
,
*NL*
traced
in
long
letters
of
bright
vermilion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
foul
parody
,
some
infamous
ignoble
satire
.
He
had
never
*NL*
done
that
.
Still
,
it
was
his
own
picture
.
He
knew
it
,
and
he
felt
as
*NL*
if
his
blood
had
changed
in
a
moment
from
fire
to
sluggish
ice
.
His
*NL*
own
picture
!
What
did
it
mean
?
Why
had
it
altered
?
He
turned
and
*NL*
looked
at
Dorian
Gray
with
the
eyes
of
a
sick
man
.
His
mouth
twitched
,
*NL*
and
his
parched
tongue
seemed
unable
to
articulate
.
He
passed
his
hand
*NL*
across
his
forehead
.
It
was
dank
with
clammy
sweat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
was
leaning
against
the
mantelshelf
,
watching
him
with
*NL*
that
strange
expression
that
one
sees
on
the
faces
of
those
who
are
*NL*
absorbed
in
a
play
when
some
great
artist
is
acting
.
There
was
neither
*NL*
real
sorrow
in
it
nor
real
joy
.
There
was
simply
the
passion
of
the
*NL*
spectator
,
with
perhaps
a
flicker
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
.
He
had
taken
*NL*
the
flower
out
of
his
coat
,
and
was
smelling
it
,
or
pretending
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
mean
?
''
cried
Hallward
,
at
last
.
His
own
voice
sounded
*NL*
shrill
and
curious
in
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Years
ago
,
when
I
was
a
boy
,
''
said
Dorian
Gray
,
crushing
the
flower
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
``
you
met
me
,
flattered
me
,
and
taught
me
to
be
vain
of
my
*NL*
good
looks
.
One
day
you
introduced
me
to
a
friend
of
yours
,
who
*NL*
explained
to
me
the
wonder
of
youth
,
and
you
finished
a
portrait
of
me
*NL*
that
revealed
to
me
the
wonder
of
beauty
.
In
a
mad
moment
that
,
even
*NL*
now
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
regret
or
not
,
I
made
a
wish
,
perhaps
you
*NL*
would
call
it
a
prayer
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
it
!
Oh
,
how
well
I
remember
it
!
No
!
the
thing
is
*NL*
impossible
.
The
room
is
damp
.
Mildew
has
got
into
the
canvas
.
The
*NL*
paints
I
used
had
some
wretched
mineral
poison
in
them
.
I
tell
you
the
*NL*
thing
is
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
is
impossible
?
''
murmured
the
young
man
,
going
over
to
the
*NL*
window
and
leaning
his
forehead
against
the
cold
,
mist-stained
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
me
you
had
destroyed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
wrong
.
It
has
destroyed
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
is
my
picture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
see
your
ideal
in
it
?
''
said
Dorian
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
ideal
,
as
you
call
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
called
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
nothing
evil
in
it
,
nothing
shameful
.
You
were
to
me
such
*NL*
an
ideal
as
I
shall
never
meet
again
.
This
is
the
face
of
a
satyr
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
face
of
my
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christ
!
what
a
thing
I
must
have
worshipped
!
It
has
the
eyes
of
a
*NL*
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Each
of
us
has
heaven
and
hell
in
him
,
Basil
,
''
cried
Dorian
with
a
*NL*
wild
gesture
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hallward
turned
again
to
the
portrait
and
gazed
at
it
.
``
My
God
!
If
it
*NL*
is
true
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
and
this
is
what
you
have
done
with
your
life
,
*NL*
why
,
you
must
be
worse
even
than
those
who
talk
against
you
fancy
you
*NL*
to
be
!
''
He
held
the
light
up
again
to
the
canvas
and
examined
it
.
The
*NL*
surface
seemed
to
be
quite
undisturbed
and
as
he
had
left
it
.
It
was
*NL*
from
within
,
apparently
,
that
the
foulness
and
horror
had
come
.
*NL*
Through
some
strange
quickening
of
inner
life
the
leprosies
of
sin
were
*NL*
slowly
eating
the
thing
away
.
The
rotting
of
a
corpse
in
a
watery
*NL*
grave
was
not
so
fearful
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
shook
,
and
the
candle
fell
from
its
socket
on
the
floor
and
*NL*
lay
there
sputtering
.
He
placed
his
foot
on
it
and
put
it
out
.
Then
*NL*
he
flung
himself
into
the
rickety
chair
that
was
standing
by
the
table
*NL*
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
Dorian
,
what
a
lesson
!
What
an
awful
lesson
!
''
There
was
no
*NL*
answer
,
but
he
could
hear
the
young
man
sobbing
at
the
window
.
``
Pray
,
*NL*
Dorian
,
pray
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
What
is
it
that
one
was
taught
to
say
in
*NL*
one
's
boyhood
?
`
Lead
us
not
into
temptation
.
Forgive
us
our
sins
.
*NL*
Wash
away
our
iniquities
.
'
Let
us
say
that
together
.
The
prayer
of
*NL*
your
pride
has
been
answered
.
The
prayer
of
your
repentance
will
be
*NL*
answered
also
.
I
worshipped
you
too
much
.
I
am
punished
for
it
.
You
*NL*
worshipped
yourself
too
much
.
We
are
both
punished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
turned
slowly
around
and
looked
at
him
with
tear-dimmed
*NL*
eyes
.
``
It
is
too
late
,
Basil
,
''
he
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
never
too
late
,
Dorian
.
Let
us
kneel
down
and
try
if
we
can
not
*NL*
remember
a
prayer
.
Is
n't
there
a
verse
somewhere
,
`
Though
your
sins
be
*NL*
as
scarlet
,
yet
I
will
make
them
as
white
as
snow
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
words
mean
nothing
to
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
Do
n't
say
that
.
You
have
done
enough
evil
in
your
life
.
My
*NL*
God
!
Do
n't
you
see
that
accursed
thing
leering
at
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
glanced
at
the
picture
,
and
suddenly
an
uncontrollable
*NL*
feeling
of
hatred
for
Basil
Hallward
came
over
him
,
as
though
it
had
*NL*
been
suggested
to
him
by
the
image
on
the
canvas
,
whispered
into
his
*NL*
ear
by
those
grinning
lips
.
The
mad
passions
of
a
hunted
animal
*NL*
stirred
within
him
,
and
he
loathed
the
man
who
was
seated
at
the
table
,
*NL*
more
than
in
his
whole
life
he
had
ever
loathed
anything
.
He
glanced
*NL*
wildly
around
.
Something
glimmered
on
the
top
of
the
painted
chest
*NL*
that
faced
him
.
His
eye
fell
on
it
.
He
knew
what
it
was
.
It
was
a
*NL*
knife
that
he
had
brought
up
,
some
days
before
,
to
cut
a
piece
of
cord
,
*NL*
and
had
forgotten
to
take
away
with
him
.
He
moved
slowly
towards
it
,
*NL*
passing
Hallward
as
he
did
so
.
As
soon
as
he
got
behind
him
,
he
seized
*NL*
it
and
turned
round
.
Hallward
stirred
in
his
chair
as
if
he
was
going
*NL*
to
rise
.
He
rushed
at
him
and
dug
the
knife
into
the
great
vein
that
*NL*
is
behind
the
ear
,
crushing
the
man
's
head
down
on
the
table
and
*NL*
stabbing
again
and
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stifled
groan
and
the
horrible
sound
of
some
one
choking
*NL*
with
blood
.
Three
times
the
outstretched
arms
shot
up
convulsively
,
*NL*
waving
grotesque
,
stiff-fingered
hands
in
the
air
.
He
stabbed
him
*NL*
twice
more
,
but
the
man
did
not
move
.
Something
began
to
trickle
on
*NL*
the
floor
.
He
waited
for
a
moment
,
still
pressing
the
head
down
.
Then
*NL*
he
threw
the
knife
on
the
table
,
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
nothing
,
but
the
drip
,
drip
on
the
threadbare
carpet
.
He
*NL*
opened
the
door
and
went
out
on
the
landing
.
The
house
was
absolutely
*NL*
quiet
.
No
one
was
about
.
For
a
few
seconds
he
stood
bending
over
the
*NL*
balustrade
and
peering
down
into
the
black
seething
well
of
darkness
.
*NL*
Then
he
took
out
the
key
and
returned
to
the
room
,
locking
himself
in
*NL*
as
he
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thing
was
still
seated
in
the
chair
,
straining
over
the
table
with
*NL*
bowed
head
,
and
humped
back
,
and
long
fantastic
arms
.
Had
it
not
been
*NL*
for
the
red
jagged
tear
in
the
neck
and
the
clotted
black
pool
that
was
*NL*
slowly
widening
on
the
table
,
one
would
have
said
that
the
man
was
*NL*
simply
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
quickly
it
had
all
been
done
!
He
felt
strangely
calm
,
and
walking
*NL*
over
to
the
window
,
opened
it
and
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
.
The
wind
*NL*
had
blown
the
fog
away
,
and
the
sky
was
like
a
monstrous
peacock
's
*NL*
tail
,
starred
with
myriads
of
golden
eyes
.
He
looked
down
and
saw
the
*NL*
policeman
going
his
rounds
and
flashing
the
long
beam
of
his
lantern
on
*NL*
the
doors
of
the
silent
houses
.
The
crimson
spot
of
a
prowling
hansom
*NL*
gleamed
at
the
corner
and
then
vanished
.
A
woman
in
a
fluttering
shawl
*NL*
was
creeping
slowly
by
the
railings
,
staggering
as
she
went
.
Now
and
*NL*
then
she
stopped
and
peered
back
.
Once
,
she
began
to
sing
in
a
hoarse
*NL*
voice
.
The
policeman
strolled
over
and
said
something
to
her
.
She
*NL*
stumbled
away
,
laughing
.
A
bitter
blast
swept
across
the
square
.
The
*NL*
gas-lamps
flickered
and
became
blue
,
and
the
leafless
trees
shook
their
*NL*
black
iron
branches
to
and
fro
.
He
shivered
and
went
back
,
closing
the
*NL*
window
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
reached
the
door
,
he
turned
the
key
and
opened
it
.
He
did
not
*NL*
even
glance
at
the
murdered
man
.
He
felt
that
the
secret
of
the
whole
*NL*
thing
was
not
to
realize
the
situation
.
The
friend
who
had
painted
the
*NL*
fatal
portrait
to
which
all
his
misery
had
been
due
had
gone
out
of
his
*NL*
life
.
That
was
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
remembered
the
lamp
.
It
was
a
rather
curious
one
of
Moorish
*NL*
workmanship
,
made
of
dull
silver
inlaid
with
arabesques
of
burnished
*NL*
steel
,
and
studded
with
coarse
turquoises
.
Perhaps
it
might
be
missed
*NL*
by
his
servant
,
and
questions
would
be
asked
.
He
hesitated
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
then
he
turned
back
and
took
it
from
the
table
.
He
could
not
*NL*
help
seeing
the
dead
thing
.
How
still
it
was
!
How
horribly
white
the
*NL*
long
hands
looked
!
It
was
like
a
dreadful
wax
image
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
locked
the
door
behind
him
,
he
crept
quietly
downstairs
.
The
*NL*
woodwork
creaked
and
seemed
to
cry
out
as
if
in
pain
.
He
stopped
*NL*
several
times
and
waited
.
No
:
everything
was
still
.
It
was
merely
*NL*
the
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
library
,
he
saw
the
bag
and
coat
in
the
corner
.
*NL*
They
must
be
hidden
away
somewhere
.
He
unlocked
a
secret
press
that
*NL*
was
in
the
wainscoting
,
a
press
in
which
he
kept
his
own
curious
*NL*
disguises
,
and
put
them
into
it
.
He
could
easily
burn
them
afterwards
.
*NL*
Then
he
pulled
out
his
watch
.
It
was
twenty
minutes
to
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
and
began
to
think
.
Every
year
--
every
month
,
almost
--
men
*NL*
were
strangled
in
England
for
what
he
had
done
.
There
had
been
a
*NL*
madness
of
murder
in
the
air
.
Some
red
star
had
come
too
close
to
the
*NL*
earth
...
And
yet
,
what
evidence
was
there
against
him
?
Basil
Hallward
*NL*
had
left
the
house
at
eleven
.
No
one
had
seen
him
come
in
again
.
Most
*NL*
of
the
servants
were
at
Selby
Royal
.
His
valet
had
gone
to
bed
...
*NL*
Paris
!
Yes
.
It
was
to
Paris
that
Basil
had
gone
,
and
by
the
midnight
*NL*
train
,
as
he
had
intended
.
With
his
curious
reserved
habits
,
it
would
*NL*
be
months
before
any
suspicions
would
be
roused
.
Months
!
Everything
*NL*
could
be
destroyed
long
before
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
thought
struck
him
.
He
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
hat
and
went
*NL*
out
into
the
hall
.
There
he
paused
,
hearing
the
slow
heavy
tread
of
*NL*
the
policeman
on
the
pavement
outside
and
seeing
the
flash
of
the
*NL*
bull
's
-
eye
reflected
in
the
window
.
He
waited
and
held
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
moments
he
drew
back
the
latch
and
slipped
out
,
shutting
*NL*
the
door
very
gently
behind
him
.
Then
he
began
ringing
the
bell
.
In
*NL*
about
five
minutes
his
valet
appeared
,
half-dressed
and
looking
very
*NL*
drowsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
have
had
to
wake
you
up
,
Francis
,
''
he
said
,
stepping
in
;
*NL*
``
but
I
had
forgotten
my
latch-key
.
What
time
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
minutes
past
two
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
man
,
looking
at
the
clock
and
*NL*
blinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
minutes
past
two
?
How
horribly
late
!
You
must
wake
me
at
nine
*NL*
to-morrow
.
I
have
some
work
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
any
one
call
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Hallward
,
sir
.
He
stayed
here
till
eleven
,
and
then
he
went
away
*NL*
to
catch
his
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
am
sorry
I
did
n't
see
him
.
Did
he
leave
any
message
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
except
that
he
would
write
to
you
from
Paris
,
if
he
did
not
*NL*
find
you
at
the
club
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
Francis
.
Do
n't
forget
to
call
me
at
nine
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
shambled
down
the
passage
in
his
slippers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
threw
his
hat
and
coat
upon
the
table
and
passed
into
the
*NL*
library
.
For
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
,
*NL*
biting
his
lip
and
thinking
.
Then
he
took
down
the
Blue
Book
from
one
*NL*
of
the
shelves
and
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
.
``
Alan
Campbell
,
152
,
*NL*
Hertford
Street
,
Mayfair
.
''
Yes
;
that
was
the
man
he
wanted
.

CHAPTER
14
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
the
next
morning
his
servant
came
in
with
a
cup
of
*NL*
chocolate
on
a
tray
and
opened
the
shutters
.
Dorian
was
sleeping
quite
*NL*
peacefully
,
lying
on
his
right
side
,
with
one
hand
underneath
his
*NL*
cheek
.
He
looked
like
a
boy
who
had
been
tired
out
with
play
,
or
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
had
to
touch
him
twice
on
the
shoulder
before
he
woke
,
and
as
*NL*
he
opened
his
eyes
a
faint
smile
passed
across
his
lips
,
as
though
he
*NL*
had
been
lost
in
some
delightful
dream
.
Yet
he
had
not
dreamed
at
all
.
*NL*
His
night
had
been
untroubled
by
any
images
of
pleasure
or
of
pain
.
*NL*
But
youth
smiles
without
any
reason
.
It
is
one
of
its
chiefest
charms
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
,
and
leaning
upon
his
elbow
,
began
to
sip
his
*NL*
chocolate
.
The
mellow
November
sun
came
streaming
into
the
room
.
The
*NL*
sky
was
bright
,
and
there
was
a
genial
warmth
in
the
air
.
It
was
*NL*
almost
like
a
morning
in
May
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
crept
with
silent
,
*NL*
blood-stained
feet
into
his
brain
and
reconstructed
themselves
there
*NL*
with
terrible
distinctness
.
He
winced
at
the
memory
of
all
that
he
had
*NL*
suffered
,
and
for
a
moment
the
same
curious
feeling
of
loathing
for
*NL*
Basil
Hallward
that
had
made
him
kill
him
as
he
sat
in
the
chair
came
*NL*
back
to
him
,
and
he
grew
cold
with
passion
.
The
dead
man
was
still
*NL*
sitting
there
,
too
,
and
in
the
sunlight
now
.
How
horrible
that
was
!
*NL*
Such
hideous
things
were
for
the
darkness
,
not
for
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
if
he
brooded
on
what
he
had
gone
through
he
would
sicken
*NL*
or
grow
mad
.
There
were
sins
whose
fascination
was
more
in
the
memory
*NL*
than
in
the
doing
of
them
,
strange
triumphs
that
gratified
the
pride
*NL*
more
than
the
passions
,
and
gave
to
the
intellect
a
quickened
sense
of
*NL*
joy
,
greater
than
any
joy
they
brought
,
or
could
ever
bring
,
to
the
*NL*
senses
.
But
this
was
not
one
of
them
.
It
was
a
thing
to
be
driven
out
*NL*
of
the
mind
,
to
be
drugged
with
poppies
,
to
be
strangled
lest
it
might
*NL*
strangle
one
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
half-hour
struck
,
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
,
and
*NL*
then
got
up
hastily
and
dressed
himself
with
even
more
than
his
usual
*NL*
care
,
giving
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
the
choice
of
his
necktie
and
*NL*
scarf-pin
and
changing
his
rings
more
than
once
.
He
spent
a
long
time
*NL*
also
over
breakfast
,
tasting
the
various
dishes
,
talking
to
his
valet
*NL*
about
some
new
liveries
that
he
was
thinking
of
getting
made
for
the
*NL*
servants
at
Selby
,
and
going
through
his
correspondence
.
At
some
of
*NL*
the
letters
,
he
smiled
.
Three
of
them
bored
him
.
One
he
read
several
*NL*
times
over
and
then
tore
up
with
a
slight
look
of
annoyance
in
his
*NL*
face
.
``
That
awful
thing
,
a
woman
's
memory
!
''
as
Lord
Henry
had
once
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
drunk
his
cup
of
black
coffee
,
he
wiped
his
lips
slowly
*NL*
with
a
napkin
,
motioned
to
his
servant
to
wait
,
and
going
over
to
the
*NL*
table
,
sat
down
and
wrote
two
letters
.
One
he
put
in
his
pocket
,
the
*NL*
other
he
handed
to
the
valet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
this
round
to
152
,
Hertford
Street
,
Francis
,
and
if
Mr.
Campbell
*NL*
is
out
of
town
,
get
his
address
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
was
alone
,
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
began
sketching
upon
a
*NL*
piece
of
paper
,
drawing
first
flowers
and
bits
of
architecture
,
and
*NL*
then
human
faces
.
Suddenly
he
remarked
that
every
face
that
he
drew
*NL*
seemed
to
have
a
fantastic
likeness
to
Basil
Hallward
.
He
frowned
,
and
*NL*
getting
up
,
went
over
to
the
book-case
and
took
out
a
volume
at
hazard
.
*NL*
He
was
determined
that
he
would
not
think
about
what
had
happened
until
*NL*
it
became
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
stretched
himself
on
the
sofa
,
he
looked
at
the
title-page
*NL*
of
the
book
.
It
was
Gautier
's
Emaux
et
Camees
,
Charpentier
's
*NL*
Japanese-paper
edition
,
with
the
Jacquemart
etching
.
The
binding
was
*NL*
of
citron-green
leather
,
with
a
design
of
gilt
trellis-work
and
dotted
*NL*
pomegranates
.
It
had
been
given
to
him
by
Adrian
Singleton
.
As
he
*NL*
turned
over
the
pages
,
his
eye
fell
on
the
poem
about
the
hand
of
*NL*
Lacenaire
,
the
cold
yellow
hand
''
_
du
supplice
encore
mal
lavee
_
,
''
with
*NL*
its
downy
red
hairs
and
its
''
_
doigts
de
faune
_
.
''
He
glanced
at
his
own
*NL*
white
taper
fingers
,
shuddering
slightly
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
*NL*
passed
on
,
till
he
came
to
those
lovely
stanzas
upon
Venice
:
*NL*
*NL*
Sur
une
gamme
chromatique
,
*NL*
Le
sein
de
peries
ruisselant
,
*NL*
La
Venus
de
l'Adriatique
*NL*
Sort
de
l'eau
son
corps
rose
et
blanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
Les
domes
,
sur
l'azur
des
ondes
*NL*
Suivant
la
phrase
au
pur
contour
,
*NL*
S'enflent
comme
des
gorges
rondes
*NL*
Que
souleve
un
soupir
d'amour
.
*NL*
*NL*
L'esquif
aborde
et
me
depose
,
*NL*
Jetant
son
amarre
au
pilier
,
*NL*
Devant
une
facade
rose
,
*NL*
Sur
le
marbre
d'un
escalier
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
How
exquisite
they
were
!
As
one
read
them
,
one
seemed
to
be
floating
*NL*
down
the
green
water-ways
of
the
pink
and
pearl
city
,
seated
in
a
black
*NL*
gondola
with
silver
prow
and
trailing
curtains
.
The
mere
lines
looked
*NL*
to
him
like
those
straight
lines
of
turquoise-blue
that
follow
one
as
*NL*
one
pushes
out
to
the
Lido
.
The
sudden
flashes
of
colour
reminded
him
*NL*
of
the
gleam
of
the
opal-and-iris-throated
birds
that
flutter
round
the
*NL*
tall
honeycombed
Campanile
,
or
stalk
,
with
such
stately
grace
,
through
*NL*
the
dim
,
dust-stained
arcades
.
Leaning
back
with
half-closed
eyes
,
he
*NL*
kept
saying
over
and
over
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devant
une
facade
rose
,
*NL*
Sur
le
marbre
d'un
escalier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
Venice
was
in
those
two
lines
.
He
remembered
the
autumn
*NL*
that
he
had
passed
there
,
and
a
wonderful
love
that
had
stirred
him
to
*NL*
mad
delightful
follies
.
There
was
romance
in
every
place
.
But
Venice
,
*NL*
like
Oxford
,
had
kept
the
background
for
romance
,
and
,
to
the
true
*NL*
romantic
,
background
was
everything
,
or
almost
everything
.
Basil
had
*NL*
been
with
him
part
of
the
time
,
and
had
gone
wild
over
Tintoret
.
Poor
*NL*
Basil
!
What
a
horrible
way
for
a
man
to
die
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
,
and
took
up
the
volume
again
,
and
tried
to
forget
.
He
read
*NL*
of
the
swallows
that
fly
in
and
out
of
the
little
_
cafe
_
at
Smyrna
where
*NL*
the
Hadjis
sit
counting
their
amber
beads
and
the
turbaned
merchants
*NL*
smoke
their
long
tasselled
pipes
and
talk
gravely
to
each
other
;
he
*NL*
read
of
the
Obelisk
in
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
that
weeps
tears
of
*NL*
granite
in
its
lonely
sunless
exile
and
longs
to
be
back
by
the
hot
,
*NL*
lotus-covered
Nile
,
where
there
are
Sphinxes
,
and
rose-red
ibises
,
and
*NL*
white
vultures
with
gilded
claws
,
and
crocodiles
with
small
beryl
eyes
*NL*
that
crawl
over
the
green
steaming
mud
;
he
began
to
brood
over
those
*NL*
verses
which
,
drawing
music
from
kiss-stained
marble
,
tell
of
that
*NL*
curious
statue
that
Gautier
compares
to
a
contralto
voice
,
the
''
_
monstre
*NL*
charmant
_
''
that
couches
in
the
porphyry-room
of
the
Louvre
.
But
after
a
*NL*
time
the
book
fell
from
his
hand
.
He
grew
nervous
,
and
a
horrible
fit
*NL*
of
terror
came
over
him
.
What
if
Alan
Campbell
should
be
out
of
*NL*
England
?
Days
would
elapse
before
he
could
come
back
.
Perhaps
he
*NL*
might
refuse
to
come
.
What
could
he
do
then
?
Every
moment
was
of
*NL*
vital
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
great
friends
once
,
five
years
before
--
almost
*NL*
inseparable
,
indeed
.
Then
the
intimacy
had
come
suddenly
to
an
end
.
*NL*
When
they
met
in
society
now
,
it
was
only
Dorian
Gray
who
smiled
:
Alan
*NL*
Campbell
never
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
an
extremely
clever
young
man
,
though
he
had
no
real
*NL*
appreciation
of
the
visible
arts
,
and
whatever
little
sense
of
the
*NL*
beauty
of
poetry
he
possessed
he
had
gained
entirely
from
Dorian
.
His
*NL*
dominant
intellectual
passion
was
for
science
.
At
Cambridge
he
had
*NL*
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
time
working
in
the
laboratory
,
and
had
taken
*NL*
a
good
class
in
the
Natural
Science
Tripos
of
his
year
.
Indeed
,
he
was
*NL*
still
devoted
to
the
study
of
chemistry
,
and
had
a
laboratory
of
his
*NL*
own
in
which
he
used
to
shut
himself
up
all
day
long
,
greatly
to
the
*NL*
annoyance
of
his
mother
,
who
had
set
her
heart
on
his
standing
for
*NL*
Parliament
and
had
a
vague
idea
that
a
chemist
was
a
person
who
made
up
*NL*
prescriptions
.
He
was
an
excellent
musician
,
however
,
as
well
,
and
*NL*
played
both
the
violin
and
the
piano
better
than
most
amateurs
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
it
was
music
that
had
first
brought
him
and
Dorian
Gray
*NL*
together
--
music
and
that
indefinable
attraction
that
Dorian
seemed
to
*NL*
be
able
to
exercise
whenever
he
wished
--
and
,
indeed
,
exercised
often
*NL*
without
being
conscious
of
it
.
They
had
met
at
Lady
Berkshire
's
the
*NL*
night
that
Rubinstein
played
there
,
and
after
that
used
to
be
always
*NL*
seen
together
at
the
opera
and
wherever
good
music
was
going
on
.
For
*NL*
eighteen
months
their
intimacy
lasted
.
Campbell
was
always
either
at
*NL*
Selby
Royal
or
in
Grosvenor
Square
.
To
him
,
as
to
many
others
,
Dorian
*NL*
Gray
was
the
type
of
everything
that
is
wonderful
and
fascinating
in
*NL*
life
.
Whether
or
not
a
quarrel
had
taken
place
between
them
no
one
*NL*
ever
knew
.
But
suddenly
people
remarked
that
they
scarcely
spoke
when
*NL*
they
met
and
that
Campbell
seemed
always
to
go
away
early
from
any
*NL*
party
at
which
Dorian
Gray
was
present
.
He
had
changed
,
too
--
was
*NL*
strangely
melancholy
at
times
,
appeared
almost
to
dislike
hearing
*NL*
music
,
and
would
never
himself
play
,
giving
as
his
excuse
,
when
he
was
*NL*
called
upon
,
that
he
was
so
absorbed
in
science
that
he
had
no
time
*NL*
left
in
which
to
practise
.
And
this
was
certainly
true
.
Every
day
he
*NL*
seemed
to
become
more
interested
in
biology
,
and
his
name
appeared
once
*NL*
or
twice
in
some
of
the
scientific
reviews
in
connection
with
certain
*NL*
curious
experiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
man
Dorian
Gray
was
waiting
for
.
Every
second
he
kept
*NL*
glancing
at
the
clock
.
As
the
minutes
went
by
he
became
horribly
*NL*
agitated
.
At
last
he
got
up
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
,
*NL*
looking
like
a
beautiful
caged
thing
.
He
took
long
stealthy
strides
.
*NL*
His
hands
were
curiously
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
suspense
became
unbearable
.
Time
seemed
to
him
to
be
crawling
with
*NL*
feet
of
lead
,
while
he
by
monstrous
winds
was
being
swept
towards
the
*NL*
jagged
edge
of
some
black
cleft
of
precipice
.
He
knew
what
was
waiting
*NL*
for
him
there
;
saw
it
,
indeed
,
and
,
shuddering
,
crushed
with
dank
hands
*NL*
his
burning
lids
as
though
he
would
have
robbed
the
very
brain
of
sight
*NL*
and
driven
the
eyeballs
back
into
their
cave
.
It
was
useless
.
The
*NL*
brain
had
its
own
food
on
which
it
battened
,
and
the
imagination
,
made
*NL*
grotesque
by
terror
,
twisted
and
distorted
as
a
living
thing
by
pain
,
*NL*
danced
like
some
foul
puppet
on
a
stand
and
grinned
through
moving
*NL*
masks
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
time
stopped
for
him
.
Yes
:
that
blind
,
*NL*
slow-breathing
thing
crawled
no
more
,
and
horrible
thoughts
,
time
being
*NL*
dead
,
raced
nimbly
on
in
front
,
and
dragged
a
hideous
future
from
its
*NL*
grave
,
and
showed
it
to
him
.
He
stared
at
it
.
Its
very
horror
made
*NL*
him
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
door
opened
and
his
servant
entered
.
He
turned
glazed
eyes
*NL*
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Campbell
,
sir
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sigh
of
relief
broke
from
his
parched
lips
,
and
the
colour
came
back
*NL*
to
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
to
come
in
at
once
,
Francis
.
''
He
felt
that
he
was
himself
*NL*
again
.
His
mood
of
cowardice
had
passed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
bowed
and
retired
.
In
a
few
moments
,
Alan
Campbell
walked
in
,
*NL*
looking
very
stern
and
rather
pale
,
his
pallor
being
intensified
by
his
*NL*
coal-black
hair
and
dark
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
!
This
is
kind
of
you
.
I
thank
you
for
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
intended
never
to
enter
your
house
again
,
Gray
.
But
you
said
it
*NL*
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
.
''
His
voice
was
hard
and
cold
.
He
*NL*
spoke
with
slow
deliberation
.
There
was
a
look
of
contempt
in
the
*NL*
steady
searching
gaze
that
he
turned
on
Dorian
.
He
kept
his
hands
in
*NL*
the
pockets
of
his
Astrakhan
coat
,
and
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
the
*NL*
gesture
with
which
he
had
been
greeted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death

Alan
,
and
to
more
than
one
*NL*
person

Sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Campbell
took
a
chair
by
the
table
,
and
Dorian
sat
opposite
to
him
.
*NL*
The
two
men
's
eyes
met
.
In
Dorian
's
there
was
infinite
pity
.
He
knew
*NL*
that
what
he
was
going
to
do
was
dreadful
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
strained
moment
of
silence
,
he
leaned
across
and
said
,
very
*NL*
quietly
,
but
watching
the
effect
of
each
word
upon
the
face
of
him
he
*NL*
had
sent
for
,
``
Alan

a
locked
room

top

The

linger
sometimes

The

If

Do

*NL*
``
There

It

You

``
It

*NL*
*NL*
The
same
look
of
pity
came
into
Dorian
Gray
's
eyes
.
Then
he
stretched
*NL*
out
his
hand
,
took
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
wrote
something
on
it
.
He
*NL*
read
it
over
twice
,
folded
it
carefully
,
and
pushed
it
across
the
*NL*
table
.
Having
done
this
,
he
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Campbell
looked
at
him
in
surprise
,
and
then
took
up
the
paper
,
and
*NL*
opened
it
.
As
he
read
it
,
his
face
became
ghastly
pale
and
he
fell
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
.
A
horrible
sense
of
sickness
came
over
him
.
He
*NL*
felt
as
if
his
heart
was
beating
itself
to
death
in
some
empty
hollow
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
two
or
three
minutes
of
terrible
silence
,
Dorian
turned
round
and
*NL*
came
and
stood
behind
him
,
putting
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
sorry
for
you
,
Alan
,
''
he
murmured
,
``
but
you
leave
me
no
*NL*
alternative

I
have
a
letter
written
already

Here
it
is

You

*NL*
the
address
.
If
you
do

I

If

You
know
what
the
result
will
be

But
you
are
*NL*
going

help
me

It
is
impossible
for
you
to
refuse
now
.
I
tried
to
*NL*
spare
you
.
You
will
do
me
the
justice
to
admit
that
.
You
were
stern
,
*NL*
harsh
,
offensive
.
You
treated
me
as
no
man
has
ever
dared
to
treat
*NL*
me
--
no
living
man
,
at
any
rate

I
bore
it
all
.
Now
it
is
for
me
to
*NL*
dictate
terms

''
*NL*
*NL*
Campbell
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
,
and
a
shudder
passed
through
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
my
turn
to
dictate
terms
,
Alan
.
You
know
what
they
are
.
*NL*
The
thing
is
quite
simple
.
Come
,
do
n't
work
yourself
into
this
fever
.
*NL*
The
thing
has
to
be
done
.
Face
it
,
and
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
groan
broke
from
Campbell
's
lips
and
he
shivered
all
over
.
The
*NL*
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
seemed
to
him
to
be
dividing
*NL*
time
into
separate
atoms
of
agony
,
each
of
which
was
too
terrible
to
be
*NL*
borne
.
He
felt
as
if
an
iron
ring
was
being
slowly
tightened
round
his
*NL*
forehead
,
as
if
the
disgrace
with
which
he
was
threatened
had
already
*NL*
come
upon
him
.
The
hand
upon
his
shoulder
weighed
like
a
hand
of
lead
.
*NL*
It
was
intolerable
.
It
seemed
to
crush
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Alan
,
you
must
decide
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
do
it
,
''
he
said
,
mechanically
,
as
though
words
could
alter
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
.
You
have
no
choice
.
Do
n't
delay

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
a
moment
.
``
Is
there
a
fire
in
the
room
upstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
is
a
gas-fire
with
asbestos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
to
go
home
and
get
some
things
from
the
laboratory

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Alan
,
you
must
not
leave
the
house

Write
out
on
a
sheet
of
*NL*
notepaper
what
you
want
and
my
servant
will
take
a
cab
and
bring
the
*NL*
things
back
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Campbell
scrawled
a
few
lines
,
blotted
them
,
and
addressed
an
envelope
*NL*
to
his
assistant
.
Dorian
took
the
note
up
and
read
it
carefully
.
Then
*NL*
he
rang
the
bell
and
gave
it
to
his
valet
,
with
orders
to
return
as
*NL*
soon
as
possible
and
to
bring
the
things
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
hall
door
shut
,
Campbell
started
nervously
,
and
having
got
up
*NL*
from
the
chair
,
went
over
to
the
chimney-piece
.
He
was
shivering
with
a
*NL*
kind
of
ague
.
For
nearly
twenty
minutes
,
neither
of
the
men
spoke
.
A
*NL*
fly
buzzed
noisily
about
the
room
,
and
the
ticking
of
the
clock
was
*NL*
like
the
beat
of
a
hammer
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
chime
struck
one
,
Campbell
turned
round
,
and
looking
at
Dorian
*NL*
Gray
,
saw
that
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
.
There
was
something
in
*NL*
the
purity
and
refinement
of
that
sad
face
that
seemed
to
enrage
him
.
*NL*
``
You
are
infamous
,
absolutely
infamous
!
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Alan
.
You
have
saved
my
life
,
''
said
Dorian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
life
?
Good
heavens
!
what
a
life
that
is
!
You
have
gone
from
*NL*
corruption
to
corruption
,
and
now
you
have
culminated
in
crime
.
In
*NL*
doing
what
I
am
going
to
do
--
what
you
force
me
to
do
--
it
is
not
of
your
*NL*
life
that
I
am
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Alan
,
''
murmured
Dorian
with
a
sigh
,
``
I
wish
you
had
a
thousandth
*NL*
part
of
the
pity
for
me
that
I
have
for
you
.
''
He
turned
away
as
he
*NL*
spoke
and
stood
looking
out
at
the
garden
.
Campbell
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
about
ten
minutes
a
knock
came
to
the
door
,
and
the
servant
*NL*
entered
,
carrying
a
large
mahogany
chest
of
chemicals
,
with
a
long
coil
*NL*
of
steel
and
platinum
wire
and
two
rather
curiously
shaped
iron
clamps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
leave
the
things
here
,
sir
?
''
he
asked
Campbell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dorian
.
``
And
I
am
afraid
,
Francis
,
that
I
have
another
*NL*
errand
for
you
.
What
is
the
name
of
the
man
at
Richmond
who
supplies
*NL*
Selby
with
orchids
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harden
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
Harden
.
You
must
go
down
to
Richmond
at
once
,
see
Harden
*NL*
personally
,
and
tell
him
to
send
twice
as
many
orchids
as
I
ordered
,
*NL*
and
to
have
as
few
white
ones
as
possible
.
In
fact
,
I
do
n't
want
any
*NL*
white
ones
.
It
is
a
lovely
day
,
Francis
,
and
Richmond
is
a
very
pretty
*NL*
place
--
otherwise
I
would
n't
bother
you
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
trouble
,
sir
.
At
what
time
shall
I
be
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
looked
at
Campbell
.
``
How
long
will
your
experiment
take
,
Alan
?
''
*NL*
he
said
in
a
calm
indifferent
voice
.
The
presence
of
a
third
person
in
*NL*
the
room
seemed
to
give
him
extraordinary
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Campbell
frowned
and
bit
his
lip
.
``
It
will
take
about
five
hours
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
time
enough
,
then
,
if
you
are
back
at
half-past
seven
,
*NL*
Francis
.
Or
stay
:
just
leave
my
things
out
for
dressing
.
You
can
*NL*
have
the
evening
to
yourself
.
I
am
not
dining
at
home
,
so
I
shall
not
*NL*
want
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
said
the
man
,
leaving
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Alan
,
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
.
How
heavy
this
chest
is
!
*NL*
I
'll
take
it
for
you
.
You
bring
the
other
things
.
''
He
spoke
rapidly
*NL*
and
in
an
authoritative
manner
.
Campbell
felt
dominated
by
him
.
They
*NL*
left
the
room
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
top
landing
,
Dorian
took
out
the
key
and
turned
*NL*
it
in
the
lock
.
Then
he
stopped
,
and
a
troubled
look
came
into
his
*NL*
eyes
.
He
shuddered
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
can
go
in
,
Alan
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nothing
to
me
.
I
do
n't
require
you
,
''
said
Campbell
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
half
opened
the
door
.
As
he
did
so
,
he
saw
the
face
of
his
*NL*
portrait
leering
in
the
sunlight
.
On
the
floor
in
front
of
it
the
torn
*NL*
curtain
was
lying
.
He
remembered
that
the
night
before
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
to
hide
the
fatal
canvas
,
*NL*
and
was
about
to
rush
forward
,
when
he
drew
back
with
a
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
that
loathsome
red
dew
that
gleamed
,
wet
and
glistening
,
on
*NL*
one
of
the
hands
,
as
though
the
canvas
had
sweated
blood
?
How
horrible
*NL*
it
was
!
--
more
horrible
,
it
seemed
to
him
for
the
moment
,
than
the
*NL*
silent
thing
that
he
knew
was
stretched
across
the
table
,
the
thing
*NL*
whose
grotesque
misshapen
shadow
on
the
spotted
carpet
showed
him
that
*NL*
it
had
not
stirred
,
but
was
still
there
,
as
he
had
left
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heaved
a
deep
breath
,
opened
the
door
a
little
wider
,
and
with
*NL*
half-closed
eyes
and
averted
head
,
walked
quickly
in
,
determined
that
*NL*
he
would
not
look
even
once
upon
the
dead
man
.
Then
,
stooping
down
and
*NL*
taking
up
the
gold-and-purple
hanging
,
he
flung
it
right
over
the
*NL*
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
stopped
,
feeling
afraid
to
turn
round
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
*NL*
themselves
on
the
intricacies
of
the
pattern
before
him
.
He
heard
*NL*
Campbell
bringing
in
the
heavy
chest
,
and
the
irons
,
and
the
other
*NL*
things
that
he
had
required
for
his
dreadful
work
.
He
began
to
wonder
*NL*
if
he
and
Basil
Hallward
had
ever
met
,
and
,
if
so
,
what
they
had
*NL*
thought
of
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
now
,
''
said
a
stern
voice
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
and
hurried
out
,
just
conscious
that
the
dead
man
had
been
*NL*
thrust
back
into
the
chair
and
that
Campbell
was
gazing
into
a
*NL*
glistening
yellow
face
.
As
he
was
going
downstairs
,
he
heard
the
key
*NL*
being
turned
in
the
lock
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
after
seven
when
Campbell
came
back
into
the
library
.
He
*NL*
was
pale
,
but
absolutely
calm
.
``
I
have
done
what
you
asked
me
to
do
,
''
*NL*
he
muttered
.
``
And
now
,
good-bye
.
Let
us
never
see
each
other
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
saved
me
from
ruin
,
Alan
.
I
can
not
forget
that
,
''
said
Dorian
*NL*
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Campbell
had
left
,
he
went
upstairs
.
There
was
a
horrible
*NL*
smell
of
nitric
acid
in
the
room
.
But
the
thing
that
had
been
sitting
*NL*
at
the
table
was
gone
.

CHAPTER
15
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
at
eight-thirty
,
exquisitely
dressed
and
wearing
a
large
*NL*
button-hole
of
Parma
violets
,
Dorian
Gray
was
ushered
into
Lady
*NL*
Narborough
's
drawing-room
by
bowing
servants
.
His
forehead
was
*NL*
throbbing
with
maddened
nerves
,
and
he
felt
wildly
excited
,
but
his
*NL*
manner
as
he
bent
over
his
hostess
's
hand
was
as
easy
and
graceful
as
*NL*
ever
.
Perhaps
one
never
seems
so
much
at
one
's
ease
as
when
one
has
to
*NL*
play
a
part
.
Certainly
no
one
looking
at
Dorian
Gray
that
night
could
*NL*
have
believed
that
he
had
passed
through
a
tragedy
as
horrible
as
any
*NL*
tragedy
of
our
age
.
Those
finely
shaped
fingers
could
never
have
*NL*
clutched
a
knife
for
sin
,
nor
those
smiling
lips
have
cried
out
on
God
*NL*
and
goodness
.
He
himself
could
not
help
wondering
at
the
calm
of
his
*NL*
demeanour
,
and
for
a
moment
felt
keenly
the
terrible
pleasure
of
a
*NL*
double
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
small
party
,
got
up
rather
in
a
hurry
by
Lady
Narborough
,
who
*NL*
was
a
very
clever
woman
with
what
Lord
Henry
used
to
describe
as
the
*NL*
remains
of
really
remarkable
ugliness
.
She
had
proved
an
excellent
*NL*
wife
to
one
of
our
most
tedious
ambassadors
,
and
having
buried
her
*NL*
husband
properly
in
a
marble
mausoleum
,
which
she
had
herself
designed
,
*NL*
and
married
off
her
daughters
to
some
rich
,
rather
elderly
men
,
she
*NL*
devoted
herself
now
to
the
pleasures
of
French
fiction
,
French
cookery
,
*NL*
and
French
_
esprit
_
when
she
could
get
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
was
one
of
her
especial
favourites
,
and
she
always
told
him
that
*NL*
she
was
extremely
glad
she
had
not
met
him
in
early
life
.
``
I
know
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
I
should
have
fallen
madly
in
love
with
you
,
''
she
used
to
say
,
*NL*
``
and
thrown
my
bonnet
right
over
the
mills
for
your
sake
.
It
is
most
*NL*
fortunate
that
you
were
not
thought
of
at
the
time
.
As
it
was
,
our
*NL*
bonnets
were
so
unbecoming
,
and
the
mills
were
so
occupied
in
trying
to
*NL*
raise
the
wind
,
that
I
never
had
even
a
flirtation
with
anybody
.
*NL*
However
,
that
was
all
Narborough
's
fault
.
He
was
dreadfully
*NL*
short-sighted
,
and
there
is
no
pleasure
in
taking
in
a
husband
who
*NL*
never
sees
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
guests
this
evening
were
rather
tedious
.
The
fact
was
,
as
she
*NL*
explained
to
Dorian
,
behind
a
very
shabby
fan
,
one
of
her
married
*NL*
daughters
had
come
up
quite
suddenly
to
stay
with
her
,
and
,
to
make
*NL*
matters
worse
,
had
actually
brought
her
husband
with
her
.
``
I
think
it
*NL*
is
most
unkind
of
her
,
my
dear
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
Of
course
I
go
and
*NL*
stay
with
them
every
summer
after
I
come
from
Homburg
,
but
then
an
old
*NL*
woman
like
me
must
have
fresh
air
sometimes
,
and
besides
,
I
really
wake
*NL*
them
up
.
You
do
n't
know
what
an
existence
they
lead
down
there
.
It
is
*NL*
pure
unadulterated
country
life
.
They
get
up
early
,
because
they
have
*NL*
so
much
to
do
,
and
go
to
bed
early
,
because
they
have
so
little
to
*NL*
think
about
.
There
has
not
been
a
scandal
in
the
neighbourhood
since
*NL*
the
time
of
Queen
Elizabeth
,
and
consequently
they
all
fall
asleep
*NL*
after
dinner
.
You
sha
n't
sit
next
either
of
them
.
You
shall
sit
by
me
*NL*
and
amuse
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
murmured
a
graceful
compliment
and
looked
round
the
room
.
Yes
:
*NL*
it
was
certainly
a
tedious
party
.
Two
of
the
people
he
had
never
seen
*NL*
before
,
and
the
others
consisted
of
Ernest
Harrowden
,
one
of
those
*NL*
middle-aged
mediocrities
so
common
in
London
clubs
who
have
no
enemies
,
*NL*
but
are
thoroughly
disliked
by
their
friends
;
Lady
Ruxton
,
an
*NL*
overdressed
woman
of
forty-seven
,
with
a
hooked
nose
,
who
was
always
*NL*
trying
to
get
herself
compromised
,
but
was
so
peculiarly
plain
that
to
*NL*
her
great
disappointment
no
one
would
ever
believe
anything
against
*NL*
her
;
Mrs.
Erlynne
,
a
pushing
nobody
,
with
a
delightful
lisp
and
*NL*
Venetian-red
hair
;
Lady
Alice
Chapman
,
his
hostess
's
daughter
,
a
dowdy
*NL*
dull
girl
,
with
one
of
those
characteristic
British
faces
that
,
once
*NL*
seen
,
are
never
remembered
;
and
her
husband
,
a
red-cheeked
,
*NL*
white-whiskered
creature
who
,
like
so
many
of
his
class
,
was
under
the
*NL*
impression
that
inordinate
joviality
can
atone
for
an
entire
lack
of
*NL*
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
rather
sorry
he
had
come
,
till
Lady
Narborough
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
great
ormolu
gilt
clock
that
sprawled
in
gaudy
curves
on
the
*NL*
mauve-draped
mantelshelf
,
exclaimed
:
``
How
horrid
of
Henry
Wotton
to
be
*NL*
so
late
!
I
sent
round
to
him
this
morning
on
chance
and
he
promised
*NL*
faithfully
not
to
disappoint
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
consolation
that
Harry
was
to
be
there
,
and
when
the
door
*NL*
opened
and
he
heard
his
slow
musical
voice
lending
charm
to
some
*NL*
insincere
apology
,
he
ceased
to
feel
bored
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
dinner
he
could
not
eat
anything
.
Plate
after
plate
went
away
*NL*
untasted
.
Lady
Narborough
kept
scolding
him
for
what
she
called
``
an
*NL*
insult
to
poor
Adolphe
,
who
invented
the
_
menu
_
specially
for
you
,
''
and
*NL*
now
and
then
Lord
Henry
looked
across
at
him
,
wondering
at
his
silence
*NL*
and
abstracted
manner
.
From
time
to
time
the
butler
filled
his
glass
*NL*
with
champagne
.
He
drank
eagerly
,
and
his
thirst
seemed
to
increase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
at
last
,
as
the
_
chaud-froid
_
was
being
handed
*NL*
round
,
``
what
is
the
matter
with
you
to-night
?
You
are
quite
out
of
*NL*
sorts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
he
is
in
love
,
''
cried
Lady
Narborough
,
``
and
that
he
is
*NL*
afraid
to
tell
me
for
fear
I
should
be
jealous
.
He
is
quite
right
.
I
*NL*
certainly
should
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Lady
Narborough
,
''
murmured
Dorian
,
smiling
,
``
I
have
not
been
in
*NL*
love
for
a
whole
week
--
not
,
in
fact
,
since
Madame

Ferrol
left
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
men
can
fall
in
love
with
that
woman

exclaimed
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
``
I
really
can
not
understand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
simply
because
she
remembers
you
when
you
were
a
little
girl
,
*NL*
Lady
Narborough
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
.
``
She
is
the
one
link
between
us
and
*NL*
your
short
frocks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
not
remember
my
short
frocks
at
all
,
Lord
Henry
.
But
I
*NL*
remember
her
very
well
at
Vienna
thirty
years
ago
,
and
how
_
decolletee
_
*NL*
she
was
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
still
_
decolletee

,
''
he
answered
,
taking
an
olive
in
his
long
*NL*
fingers
;
``
and
when
she
is
in
a
very
smart
gown
she
looks
like
an
*NL*
_
edition
de
luxe
_
of
a
bad
French
novel
.
She
is
really
wonderful
,
and
*NL*
full
of
surprises
.
Her
capacity
for
family
affection
is
extraordinary
.
*NL*
When
her
third
husband
died
,
her
hair
turned
quite
gold
from
grief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you

Harry
!

cried
Dorian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
most
romantic
explanation

laughed
the
hostess
.
``
But

Henry

*NL*
``
Certainly

She

Dorian

I
asked

whether

Marguerite
de

embalmed

told

*NL*
``
The

Lord

sipping
his
wine

*NL*
*NL*
Lady

hit
him
with
her
fan

``
Lord

serious

some
moments

at

up
solemnly
from

came
up

Dorian

changed
his

went

by

Mr.

began
to
talk
in
a
loud
voice
about

the
situation
in
the
House

guffawed
at
his
adversaries

*NL*
The
word
_
doctrinaire
_
--
word
full
of
terror
to
the
British
*NL*
mind

reappeared
from
time
to
time
between
his
explosions

An
*NL*
alliterative
prefix
served
as
an
ornament
of
oratory

He
hoisted
the

Union
Jack
on
the
pinnacles

thought

The
inherited
stupidity
of

sound
English

jovially

shown
to
be

A
smile
curved
Lord

*NL*
``

The

coming

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
to
be
there
,
Harry
,
''
he
said
,
leaving
the
room
.
As
he
*NL*
drove
back
to
his
own
house
,
he
was
conscious
that
the
sense
of
terror
*NL*
he
thought
he
had
strangled
had
come
back
to
him
.
Lord
Henry
's
casual
*NL*
questioning
had
made
him
lose
his
nerve
for
the
moment
,
and
he
wanted
*NL*
his
nerve
still
.
Things
that
were
dangerous
had
to
be
destroyed
.
He
*NL*
winced
.
He
hated
the
idea
of
even
touching
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
had
to
be
done
.
He
realized
that
,
and
when
he
had
locked
the
*NL*
door
of
his
library
,
he
opened
the
secret
press
into
which
he
had
*NL*
thrust
Basil
Hallward
's
coat
and
bag
.
A
huge
fire
was
blazing
.
He
*NL*
piled
another
log
on
it
.
The
smell
of
the
singeing
clothes
and
burning
*NL*
leather
was
horrible
.
It
took
him
three-quarters
of
an
hour
to
consume
*NL*
everything
.
At
the
end
he
felt
faint
and
sick
,
and
having
lit
some
*NL*
Algerian
pastilles
in
a
pierced
copper
brazier
,
he
bathed
his
hands
and
*NL*
forehead
with
a
cool
musk-scented
vinegar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
started
.
His
eyes
grew
strangely
bright
,
and
he
gnawed
*NL*
nervously
at
his
underlip
.
Between
two
of
the
windows
stood
a
large
*NL*
Florentine
cabinet
,
made
out
of
ebony
and
inlaid
with
ivory
and
blue
*NL*
lapis
.
He
watched
it
as
though
it
were
a
thing
that
could
fascinate
*NL*
and
make
afraid
,
as
though
it
held
something
that
he
longed
for
and
yet
*NL*
almost
loathed
.
His
breath
quickened
.
A
mad
craving
came
over
him
.
*NL*
He
lit
a
cigarette
and
then
threw
it
away
.
His
eyelids
drooped
till
*NL*
the
long
fringed
lashes
almost
touched
his
cheek
.
But
he
still
watched
*NL*
the
cabinet
.
At
last
he
got
up
from
the
sofa
on
which
he
had
been
*NL*
lying
,
went
over
to
it
,
and
having
unlocked
it
,
touched
some
hidden
*NL*
spring
.
A
triangular
drawer
passed
slowly
out
.
His
fingers
moved
*NL*
instinctively
towards
it
,
dipped
in
,
and
closed
on
something
.
It
was
a
*NL*
small
Chinese
box
of
black
and
gold-dust
lacquer
,
elaborately
wrought
,
*NL*
the
sides
patterned
with
curved
waves
,
and
the
silken
cords
hung
with
*NL*
round
crystals
and
tasselled
in
plaited
metal
threads
.
He
opened
it
.
*NL*
Inside
was
a
green
paste
,
waxy
in
lustre
,
the
odour
curiously
heavy
and
*NL*
persistent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
for
some
moments
,
with
a
strangely
immobile
smile
upon
his
*NL*
face
.
Then
shivering
,
though
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
terribly
*NL*
hot
,
he
drew
himself
up
and
glanced
at
the
clock
.
It
was
twenty
*NL*
minutes
to
twelve
.
He
put
the
box
back
,
shutting
the
cabinet
doors
as
*NL*
he
did
so
,
and
went
into
his
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
midnight
was
striking
bronze
blows
upon
the
dusky
air
,
Dorian
Gray
,
*NL*
dressed
commonly
,
and
with
a
muffler
wrapped
round
his
throat
,
crept
*NL*
quietly
out
of
his
house
.
In
Bond
Street
he
found
a
hansom
with
a
good
*NL*
horse
.
He
hailed
it
and
in
a
low
voice
gave
the
driver
an
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
shook
his
head
.
``
It
is
too
far
for
me
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
a
sovereign
for
you
,
''
said
Dorian
.
``
You
shall
have
another
if
*NL*
you
drive
fast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
man
,
``
you
will
be
there
in
an
hour
,
''
and
*NL*
after
his
fare
had
got
in
he
turned
his
horse
round
and
drove
rapidly
*NL*
towards
the
river
.

CHAPTER
16
*NL*
*NL*
A
cold
rain
began
to
fall
,
and
the
blurred
street-lamps
looked
ghastly
*NL*
in
the
dripping
mist
.
The
public-houses
were
just
closing
,
and
dim
men
*NL*
and
women
were
clustering
in
broken
groups
round
their
doors
.
From
*NL*
some
of
the
bars
came
the
sound
of
horrible
laughter
.
In
others
,
*NL*
drunkards
brawled
and
screamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lying
back
in
the
hansom
,
with
his
hat
pulled
over
his
forehead
,
Dorian
*NL*
Gray
watched
with
listless
eyes
the
sordid
shame
of
the
great
city
,
and
*NL*
now
and
then
he
repeated
to
himself
the
words
that
Lord
Henry
had
said
*NL*
to
him
on
the
first
day
they
had
met
,
``
To
cure
the
soul
by
means
of
the
*NL*
senses
,
and
the
senses
by
means
of
the
soul
.
''
Yes
,
that
was
the
*NL*
secret
.
He
had
often
tried
it
,
and
would
try
it
again
now
.
There
were
*NL*
opium
dens
where
one
could
buy
oblivion
,
dens
of
horror
where
the
*NL*
memory
of
old
sins
could
be
destroyed
by
the
madness
of
sins
that
were
*NL*
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
hung
low
in
the
sky
like
a
yellow
skull
.
From
time
to
time
a
*NL*
huge
misshapen
cloud
stretched
a
long
arm
across
and
hid
it
.
The
*NL*
gas-lamps
grew
fewer
,
and
the
streets
more
narrow
and
gloomy
.
Once
the
*NL*
man
lost
his
way
and
had
to
drive
back
half
a
mile
.
A
steam
rose
from
*NL*
the
horse
as
it
splashed
up
the
puddles
.
The
sidewindows
of
the
hansom
*NL*
were
clogged
with
a
grey-flannel
mist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
cure
the
soul
by
means
of
the
senses
,
and
the
senses
by
means
of
*NL*
the
soul
!
''
How
the
words
rang
in
his
ears
!
His
soul
,
certainly
,
was
*NL*
sick
to
death
.
Was
it
true
that
the
senses
could
cure
it
?
Innocent
*NL*
blood
had
been
spilled
.
What
could
atone
for
that
?
Ah
!
for
that
there
*NL*
was
no
atonement
;
but
though
forgiveness
was
impossible
,
forgetfulness
*NL*
was
possible
still
,
and
he
was
determined
to
forget
,
to
stamp
the
thing
*NL*
out
,
to
crush
it
as
one
would
crush
the
adder
that
had
stung
one
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
what
right
had
Basil
to
have
spoken
to
him
as
he
had
done
?
Who
*NL*
had
made
him
a
judge
over
others
?
He
had
said
things
that
were
*NL*
dreadful
,
horrible
,
not
to
be
endured
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
and
on
plodded
the
hansom
,
going
slower
,
it
seemed
to
him
,
at
each
*NL*
step
.
He
thrust
up
the
trap
and
called
to
the
man
to
drive
faster
.
*NL*
The
hideous
hunger
for
opium
began
to
gnaw
at
him
.
His
throat
burned
*NL*
and
his
delicate
hands
twitched
nervously
together
.
He
struck
at
the
*NL*
horse
madly
with
his
stick
.
The
driver
laughed
and
whipped
up
.
He
*NL*
laughed
in
answer
,
and
the
man
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
seemed
interminable
,
and
the
streets
like
the
black
web
of
some
*NL*
sprawling
spider
.
The
monotony
became
unbearable
,
and
as
the
mist
*NL*
thickened
,
he
felt
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
passed
by
lonely
brickfields
.
The
fog
was
lighter
here
,
and
*NL*
he
could
see
the
strange
,
bottle-shaped
kilns
with
their
orange
,
*NL*
fanlike
tongues
of
fire
.
A
dog
barked
as
they
went
by
,
and
far
away
in
*NL*
the
darkness
some
wandering
sea-gull
screamed
.
The
horse
stumbled
in
a
*NL*
rut
,
then
swerved
aside
and
broke
into
a
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
time
they
left
the
clay
road
and
rattled
again
over
*NL*
rough-paven
streets
.
Most
of
the
windows
were
dark
,
but
now
and
then
*NL*
fantastic
shadows
were
silhouetted
against
some
lamplit
blind
.
He
*NL*
watched
them
curiously
.
They
moved
like
monstrous
marionettes
and
made
*NL*
gestures
like
live
things
.
He
hated
them
.
A
dull
rage
was
in
his
*NL*
heart
.
As
they
turned
a
corner
,
a
woman
yelled
something
at
them
from
*NL*
an
open
door
,
and
two
men
ran
after
the
hansom
for
about
a
hundred
*NL*
yards
.
The
driver
beat
at
them
with
his
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
said
that
passion
makes
one
think
in
a
circle
.
Certainly
with
*NL*
hideous
iteration
the
bitten
lips
of
Dorian
Gray
shaped
and
reshaped
*NL*
those
subtle
words
that
dealt
with
soul
and
sense
,
till
he
had
found
in
*NL*
them
the
full
expression
,
as
it
were
,
of
his
mood
,
and
justified
,
by
*NL*
intellectual
approval
,
passions
that
without
such
justification
would
*NL*
still
have
dominated
his
temper
.
From
cell
to
cell
of
his
brain
crept
*NL*
the
one
thought
;
and
the
wild
desire
to
live
,
most
terrible
of
all
*NL*
man
's
appetites
,
quickened
into
force
each
trembling
nerve
and
fibre
.
*NL*
Ugliness
that
had
once
been
hateful
to
him
because
it
made
things
real
,
*NL*
became
dear
to
him
now
for
that
very
reason
.
Ugliness
was
the
one
*NL*
reality
.
The
coarse
brawl
,
the
loathsome
den
,
the
crude
violence
of
*NL*
disordered
life
,
the
very
vileness
of
thief
and
outcast
,
were
more
*NL*
vivid
,
in
their
intense
actuality
of
impression
,
than
all
the
gracious
*NL*
shapes
of
art
,
the
dreamy
shadows
of
song
.
They
were
what
he
needed
*NL*
for
forgetfulness
.
In
three
days
he
would
be
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
man
drew
up
with
a
jerk
at
the
top
of
a
dark
lane
.
Over
*NL*
the
low
roofs
and
jagged
chimney-stacks
of
the
houses
rose
the
black
*NL*
masts
of
ships
.
Wreaths
of
white
mist
clung
like
ghostly
sails
to
the
*NL*
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somewhere
about
here
,
sir
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
he
asked
huskily
through
the
*NL*
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
started
and
peered
round
.
``
This
will
do
,
''
he
answered
,
and
*NL*
having
got
out
hastily
and
given
the
driver
the
extra
fare
he
had
*NL*
promised
him
,
he
walked
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
quay
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
a
lantern
gleamed
at
the
stern
of
some
huge
merchantman
.
The
*NL*
light
shook
and
splintered
in
the
puddles
.
A
red
glare
came
from
an
*NL*
outward-bound
steamer
that
was
coaling
.
The
slimy
pavement
looked
like
*NL*
a
wet
mackintosh
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
on
towards
the
left
,
glancing
back
now
and
then
to
see
if
he
*NL*
was
being
followed
.
In
about
seven
or
eight
minutes
he
reached
a
small
*NL*
shabby
house
that
was
wedged
in
between
two
gaunt
factories
.
In
one
of
*NL*
the
top-windows
stood
a
lamp
.
He
stopped
and
gave
a
peculiar
knock
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
time
he
heard
steps
in
the
passage
and
the
chain
being
*NL*
unhooked
.
The
door
opened
quietly
,
and
he
went
in
without
saying
a
*NL*
word
to
the
squat
misshapen
figure
that
flattened
itself
into
the
*NL*
shadow
as
he
passed
.
At
the
end
of
the
hall
hung
a
tattered
green
*NL*
curtain
that
swayed
and
shook
in
the
gusty
wind
which
had
followed
him
*NL*
in
from
the
street
.
He
dragged
it
aside
and
entered
a
long
low
room
*NL*
which
looked
as
if
it
had
once
been
a
third-rate
dancing-saloon
.
Shrill
*NL*
flaring
gas-jets
,
dulled
and
distorted
in
the
fly-blown
mirrors
that
*NL*
faced
them
,
were
ranged
round
the
walls
.
Greasy
reflectors
of
ribbed
*NL*
tin
backed
them
,
making
quivering
disks
of
light
.
The
floor
was
*NL*
covered
with
ochre-coloured
sawdust
,
trampled
here
and
there
into
mud
,
*NL*
and
stained
with
dark
rings
of
spilled
liquor
.
Some
Malays
were
*NL*
crouching
by
a
little
charcoal
stove
,
playing
with
bone
counters
and
*NL*
showing
their
white
teeth
as
they
chattered
.
In
one
corner
,
with
his
*NL*
head
buried
in
his
arms
,
a
sailor
sprawled
over
a
table
,
and
by
the
*NL*
tawdrily
painted
bar
that
ran
across
one
complete
side
stood
two
*NL*
haggard
women
,
mocking
an
old
man
who
was
brushing
the
sleeves
of
his
*NL*
coat
with
an
expression
of
disgust
.
``
He
thinks
he
's
got
red
ants
on
*NL*
him
,
''
laughed
one
of
them
,
as
Dorian
passed
by
.
The
man
looked
at
her
*NL*
in
terror
and
began
to
whimper
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
little
staircase
,
leading
to
a
*NL*
darkened
chamber
.
As
Dorian
hurried
up
its
three
rickety
steps
,
the
*NL*
heavy
odour
of
opium
met
him
.
He
heaved
a
deep
breath
,
and
his
*NL*
nostrils
quivered
with
pleasure
.
When
he
entered
,
a
young
man
with
*NL*
smooth
yellow
hair
,
who
was
bending
over
a
lamp
lighting
a
long
thin
*NL*
pipe
,
looked
up
at
him
and
nodded
in
a
hesitating
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
here
,
Adrian
?
''
muttered
Dorian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
else
should
I
be
?
''
he
answered
,
listlessly
.
``
None
of
the
chaps
*NL*
will
speak
to
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
had
left
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darlington
is
not
going
to
do
anything
.
My
brother
paid
the
bill
at
*NL*
last
.
George
does
n't
speak
to
me
either
...
I
do
n't
care
,
''
he
added
*NL*
with
a
sigh
.
``
As
long
as
one
has
this
stuff
,
one
does
n't
want
friends
.
*NL*
I
think
I
have
had
too
many
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
winced
and
looked
round
at
the
grotesque
things
that
lay
in
such
*NL*
fantastic
postures
on
the
ragged
mattresses
.
The
twisted
limbs
,
the
*NL*
gaping
mouths
,
the
staring
lustreless
eyes
,
fascinated
him
.
He
knew
in
*NL*
what
strange
heavens
they
were
suffering
,
and
what
dull
hells
were
*NL*
teaching
them
the
secret
of
some
new
joy
.
They
were
better
off
than
he
*NL*
was
.
He
was
prisoned
in
thought
.
Memory
,
like
a
horrible
malady
,
was
*NL*
eating
his
soul
away
.
From
time
to
time
he
seemed
to
see
the
eyes
of
*NL*
Basil
Hallward
looking
at
him
.
Yet
he
felt
he
could
not
stay
.
The
*NL*
presence
of
Adrian
Singleton
troubled
him
.
He
wanted
to
be
where
no
*NL*
one
would
know
who
he
was
.
He
wanted
to
escape
from
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
on
to
the
other
place
,
''
he
said
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
wharf
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
mad-cat
is
sure
to
be
there
.
They
wo
n't
have
her
in
this
place
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
I
am
sick
of
women
who
love
one
.
*NL*
Women
who
hate
one
are
much
more
interesting
.
Besides
,
the
stuff
is
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
it
better
.
Come
and
have
something
to
drink
.
I
must
have
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
anything
,
''
murmured
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adrian
Singleton
rose
up
wearily
and
followed
Dorian
to
the
bar
.
A
*NL*
half-caste
,
in
a
ragged
turban
and
a
shabby
ulster
,
grinned
a
hideous
*NL*
greeting
as
he
thrust
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
two
tumblers
in
front
of
*NL*
them
.
The
women
sidled
up
and
began
to
chatter
.
Dorian
turned
his
*NL*
back
on
them
and
said
something
in
a
low
voice
to
Adrian
Singleton
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
crooked
smile
,
like
a
Malay
crease
,
writhed
across
the
face
of
one
of
*NL*
the
women
.
``
We
are
very
proud
to-night
,
''
she
sneered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
God
's
sake
do
n't
talk
to
me
,
''
cried
Dorian
,
stamping
his
foot
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
``
What
do
you
want
?
Money
?
Here
it
is
.
Do
n't
ever
talk
*NL*
to
me
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
red
sparks
flashed
for
a
moment
in
the
woman
's
sodden
eyes
,
then
*NL*
flickered
out
and
left
them
dull
and
glazed
.
She
tossed
her
head
and
*NL*
raked
the
coins
off
the
counter
with
greedy
fingers
.
Her
companion
*NL*
watched
her
enviously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
,
''
sighed
Adrian
Singleton
.
``
I
do
n't
care
to
go
back
.
*NL*
What
does
it
matter
?
I
am
quite
happy
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
write
to
me
if
you
want
anything
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
said
Dorian
,
*NL*
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
''
answered
the
young
man
,
passing
up
the
steps
and
wiping
*NL*
his
parched
mouth
with
a
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
walked
to
the
door
with
a
look
of
pain
in
his
face
.
As
he
drew
*NL*
the
curtain
aside
,
a
hideous
laugh
broke
from
the
painted
lips
of
the
*NL*
woman
who
had
taken
his
money
.
``
There
goes
the
devil
's
bargain
!
''
she
*NL*
hiccoughed
,
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Curse
you
!
''
he
answered
,
``
do
n't
call
me
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
snapped
her
fingers
.
``
Prince
Charming
is
what
you
like
to
be
*NL*
called
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
she
yelled
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drowsy
sailor
leaped
to
his
feet
as
she
spoke
,
and
looked
wildly
*NL*
round
.
The
sound
of
the
shutting
of
the
hall
door
fell
on
his
ear
.
He
*NL*
rushed
out
as
if
in
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
hurried
along
the
quay
through
the
drizzling
rain
.
His
*NL*
meeting
with
Adrian
Singleton
had
strangely
moved
him
,
and
he
wondered
*NL*
if
the
ruin
of
that
young
life
was
really
to
be
laid
at
his
door
,
as
*NL*
Basil
Hallward
had
said
to
him
with
such
infamy
of
insult
.
He
bit
his
*NL*
lip
,
and
for
a
few
seconds
his
eyes
grew
sad
.
Yet
,
after
all
,
what
did
*NL*
it
matter
to
him
?
One
's
days
were
too
brief
to
take
the
burden
of
*NL*
another
's
errors
on
one
's
shoulders
.
Each
man
lived
his
own
life
and
*NL*
paid
his
own
price
for
living
it
.
The
only
pity
was
one
had
to
pay
so
*NL*
often
for
a
single
fault
.
One
had
to
pay
over
and
over
again
,
indeed
.
*NL*
In
her
dealings
with
man
,
destiny
never
closed
her
accounts
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
moments
,
psychologists
tell
us
,
when
the
passion
for
sin
,
or
*NL*
for
what
the
world
calls
sin
,
so
dominates
a
nature
that
every
fibre
of
*NL*
the
body
,
as
every
cell
of
the
brain
,
seems
to
be
instinct
with
fearful
*NL*
impulses
.
Men
and
women
at
such
moments
lose
the
freedom
of
their
*NL*
will
.
They
move
to
their
terrible
end
as
automatons
move
.
Choice
is
*NL*
taken
from
them
,
and
conscience
is
either
killed
,
or
,
if
it
lives
at
*NL*
all
,
lives
but
to
give
rebellion
its
fascination
and
disobedience
its
*NL*
charm
.
For
all
sins
,
as
theologians
weary
not
of
reminding
us
,
are
*NL*
sins
of
disobedience
.
When
that
high
spirit
,
that
morning
star
of
*NL*
evil
,
fell
from
heaven
,
it
was
as
a
rebel
that
he
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Callous
,
concentrated
on
evil
,
with
stained
mind
,
and
soul
hungry
for
*NL*
rebellion
,
Dorian
Gray
hastened
on
,
quickening
his
step
as
he
went
,
but
*NL*
as
he
darted
aside
into
a
dim
archway
,
that
had
served
him
often
as
a
*NL*
short
cut
to
the
ill-famed
place
where
he
was
going
,
he
felt
himself
*NL*
suddenly
seized
from
behind
,
and
before
he
had
time
to
defend
himself
,
*NL*
he
was
thrust
back
against
the
wall
,
with
a
brutal
hand
round
his
*NL*
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
struggled
madly
for
life
,
and
by
a
terrible
effort
wrenched
the
*NL*
tightening
fingers
away
.
In
a
second
he
heard
the
click
of
a
revolver
,
*NL*
and
saw
the
gleam
of
a
polished
barrel
,
pointing
straight
at
his
head
,
*NL*
and
the
dusky
form
of
a
short
,
thick-set
man
facing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
he
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
quiet
,
''
said
the
man
.
``
If
you
stir
,
I
shoot
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mad
.
What
have
I
done
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wrecked
the
life
of
Sibyl
Vane
,
''
was
the
answer
,
``
and
Sibyl
Vane
*NL*
was
my
sister
.
She
killed
herself
.
I
know
it
.
Her
death
is
at
your
*NL*
door
.
I
swore
I
would
kill
you
in
return
.
For
years
I
have
sought
*NL*
you
.
I
had
no
clue
,
no
trace
.
The
two
people
who
could
have
described
*NL*
you
were
dead
.
I
knew
nothing
of
you
but
the
pet
name
she
used
to
call
*NL*
you
.
I
heard
it
to-night
by
chance
.
Make
your
peace
with
God
,
for
*NL*
to-night
you
are
going
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
grew
sick
with
fear
.
``
I
never
knew
her
,
''
he
stammered
.
``
I
*NL*
never
heard
of
her
.
You
are
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
confess
your
sin
,
for
as
sure
as
I
am
James
Vane
,
you
*NL*
are
going
to
die
.
''
There
was
a
horrible
moment
.
Dorian
did
not
know
*NL*
what
to
say
or
do
.
``
Down
on
your
knees
!
''
growled
the
man
.
``
I
give
you
*NL*
one
minute
to
make
your
peace
--
no
more
.
I
go
on
board
to-night
for
*NL*
India
,
and
I
must
do
my
job
first
.
One
minute
.
That
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
's
arms
fell
to
his
side
.
Paralysed
with
terror
,
he
did
not
know
*NL*
what
to
do
.
Suddenly
a
wild
hope
flashed
across
his
brain
.
``
Stop
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
.
``
How
long
ago
is
it
since
your
sister
died
?
Quick
,
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eighteen
years
,
''
said
the
man
.
``
Why
do
you
ask
me
?
What
do
years
*NL*
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eighteen
years
,
''
laughed
Dorian
Gray
,
with
a
touch
of
triumph
in
his
*NL*
voice
.
``
Eighteen
years
!
Set
me
under
the
lamp
and
look
at
my
face
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
James
Vane
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
not
understanding
what
was
meant
.
*NL*
Then
he
seized
Dorian
Gray
and
dragged
him
from
the
archway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dim
and
wavering
as
was
the
wind-blown
light
,
yet
it
served
to
show
him
*NL*
the
hideous
error
,
as
it
seemed
,
into
which
he
had
fallen
,
for
the
face
*NL*
of
the
man
he
had
sought
to
kill
had
all
the
bloom
of
boyhood
,
all
the
*NL*
unstained
purity
of
youth
.
He
seemed
little
more
than
a
lad
of
twenty
*NL*
summers
,
hardly
older
,
if
older
indeed
at
all
,
than
his
sister
had
been
*NL*
when
they
had
parted
so
many
years
ago
.
It
was
obvious
that
this
was
*NL*
not
the
man
who
had
destroyed
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
loosened
his
hold
and
reeled
back
.
``
My
God
!
my
God
!
''
he
cried
,
``
and
*NL*
I
would
have
murdered
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
drew
a
long
breath
.
``
You
have
been
on
the
brink
of
*NL*
committing
a
terrible
crime
,
my
man
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
him
sternly
.
*NL*
``
Let
this
be
a
warning
to
you
not
to
take
vengeance
into
your
own
*NL*
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
sir
,
''
muttered
James
Vane
.
``
I
was
deceived
.
A
chance
*NL*
word
I
heard
in
that
damned
den
set
me
on
the
wrong
track

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
go
home
and
put
that
pistol
away
,
or
you
may
get
into
*NL*
trouble
,
''
said
Dorian
,
turning
on
his
heel
and
going
slowly
down
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
James
Vane
stood
on
the
pavement
in
horror
.
He
was
trembling
from
head
*NL*
to
foot
.
After
a
little
while
,
a
black
shadow
that
had
been
creeping
*NL*
along
the
dripping
wall
moved
out
into
the
light
and
came
close
to
him
*NL*
with
stealthy
footsteps
.
He
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
arm
and
looked
*NL*
round
with
a
start
.
It
was
one
of
the
women
who
had
been
drinking
at
*NL*
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did

out

close

his

The

gave
a
bitter
laugh

sneered

He
broke
from

rushed

CHAPTER
17
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
later
Dorian
Gray
was
sitting
in
the
conservatory
at
Selby
*NL*
Royal
,
talking
to
the
pretty
Duchess
of
Monmouth
,
who
with
her
husband
,
*NL*
a
jaded-looking
man
of
sixty
,
was
amongst
his
guests
.
It
was
tea-time
,
*NL*
and
the
mellow
light
of
the
huge
,
lace-covered
lamp
that
stood
on
the
*NL*
table
lit
up
the
delicate
china
and
hammered
silver
of
the
service
at
*NL*
which
the
duchess
was
presiding
.
Her
white
hands
were
moving
daintily
*NL*
among
the
cups
,
and
her
full
red
lips
were
smiling
at
something
that
*NL*
Dorian
had
whispered
to
her
.
Lord
Henry
was
lying
back
in
a
*NL*
silk-draped
wicker
chair
,
looking
at
them
.
On
a
peach-coloured
divan
*NL*
sat
Lady
Narborough
,
pretending
to
listen
to
the
duke
's
description
of
*NL*
the
last
Brazilian
beetle
that
he
had
added
to
his
collection
.
Three
*NL*
young
men
in
elaborate
smoking-suits
were
handing
tea-cakes
to
some
of
*NL*
the
women
.
The
house-party
consisted
of
twelve
people
,
and
there
were
*NL*
more
expected
to
arrive
on
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
two
talking
about
?
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
strolling
over
to
*NL*
the
table
and
putting
his
cup
down
.
``
I
hope
Dorian
has
told
you
about
*NL*
my
plan
for
rechristening
everything
,
Gladys
.
It
is
a
delightful
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
want
to
be
rechristened
,
Harry
,
''
rejoined
the
duchess
,
*NL*
looking
up
at
him
with
her
wonderful
eyes
.
``
I
am
quite
satisfied
with
*NL*
my
own
name
,
and
I
am
sure
Mr.
Gray
should
be
satisfied
with
his
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Gladys
,
I
would
not
alter
either
name
for
the
world
.
They
are
*NL*
both
perfect
.
I
was
thinking
chiefly
of
flowers
.
Yesterday
I
cut
an
*NL*
orchid
,
for
my
button-hole
.
It
was
a
marvellous
spotted
thing
,
as
*NL*
effective
as
the
seven
deadly
sins
.
In
a
thoughtless
moment
I
asked
*NL*
one
of
the
gardeners
what
it
was
called
.
He
told
me
it
was
a
fine
*NL*
specimen
of
_
Robinsoniana
_
,
or
something
dreadful
of
that
kind
.
It
is
a
*NL*
sad
truth
,
but
we
have
lost
the
faculty
of
giving
lovely
names
to
*NL*
things
.
Names
are
everything
.
I
never
quarrel
with
actions
.
My
one
*NL*
quarrel
is
with
words
.
That
is
the
reason
I
hate
vulgar
realism
in
*NL*
literature
.
The
man
who
could
call
a
spade
a
spade
should
be
compelled
*NL*
to
use
one
.
It
is
the
only
thing
he
is
fit
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
should
we
call
you
,
Harry
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
name
is
Prince
Paradox
,
''
said
Dorian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recognize
him
in
a
flash
,
''
exclaimed
the
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
hear
of
it
,
''
laughed
Lord
Henry
,
sinking
into
a
chair
.
``
From
*NL*
a
label
there
is
no
escape
!
I
refuse
the
title
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Royalties
may
not
abdicate
,
''
fell
as
a
warning
from
pretty
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wish
me
to
defend
my
throne
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
the
truths
of
to-morrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
prefer
the
mistakes
of
to-day
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
disarm
me
,
Gladys
,
''
he
cried
,
catching
the
wilfulness
of
her
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
your
shield
,
Harry
,
not
of
your
spear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
tilt
against
beauty

he
said
,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
your
error
,
Harry
,
believe
me
.
You
value
beauty
far
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
say
that
?
I
admit
that
I
think
that
it
is
better
to
be
*NL*
beautiful
than
to
be
good
.
But
on
the
other
hand
,
no
one
is
more
ready
*NL*
than
I
am
to
acknowledge
that
it
is
better
to
be
good
than
to
be
ugly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugliness
is
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins

cried
the
duchess
.
*NL*
``
What
becomes
of
your
simile
about
the
orchid

*NL*

he

but
hardly
had
he

finished
the
sentence
before
from
the
far
end
of
the
conservatory
came
*NL*
a
stifled
groan
,
followed
by
the
dull
sound
of
a
heavy
fall
.
Everybody
*NL*
started
up
.
The
duchess
stood
motionless
in
horror
.
And
with
fear
in
*NL*
his
eyes
,
Lord
Henry
rushed
through
the
flapping
palms
to
find
Dorian
*NL*
Gray
lying
face
downwards
on
the
tiled
floor
in
a
deathlike
swoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
carried
at
once
into
the
blue
drawing-room
and
laid
upon
one
of
*NL*
the
sofas
.
After
a
short
time
,
he
came
to
himself
and
looked
round
*NL*
with
a
dazed
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Oh
!
I
remember
.
Am
I
safe
here
,
*NL*
Harry
?
''
He
began
to
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Dorian
,
''
answered
Lord
Henry
,
``
you
merely
fainted

That
was
*NL*
all

You
must
have
overtired

You
had

down

will
take

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
will
come

he
said
,
struggling
to
his
feet
.
``
I
would
*NL*
rather
come
down
.
I
must
not
be
alone

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
his
room
and
dressed
.
There
was
a
wild
recklessness
of
*NL*
gaiety
in
his
manner
as
he
sat
at
table
,
but
now
and
then
a
thrill
of
*NL*
terror
ran
through
him
when
he
remembered
that
,
pressed
against
the
*NL*
window
of
the
conservatory
,
like
a
white
handkerchief
,
he
had
seen
the
*NL*
face
of
James
Vane
watching
him
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
18
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
did
not
leave
the
house
,
and
,
indeed
,
spent
most
of
the
*NL*
time
in
his
own
room
,
sick
with
a
wild
terror
of
dying
,
and
yet
*NL*
indifferent
to
life
itself
.
The
consciousness
of
being
hunted
,
snared
,
*NL*
tracked
down
,
had
begun
to
dominate
him
.
If
the
tapestry
did
but
*NL*
tremble
in
the
wind
,
he
shook
.
The
dead
leaves
that
were
blown
against
*NL*
the
leaded
panes
seemed
to
him
like
his
own
wasted
resolutions
and
wild
*NL*
regrets
.
When
he
closed
his
eyes
,
he
saw
again
the
sailor
's
face
*NL*
peering
through
the
mist-stained
glass
,
and
horror
seemed
once
more
to
*NL*
lay
its
hand
upon
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
perhaps
it
had
been
only
his
fancy
that
had
called
vengeance
out
of
*NL*
the
night
and
set
the
hideous
shapes
of
punishment
before
him
.
Actual
*NL*
life
was
chaos
,
but
there
was
something
terribly
logical
in
the
*NL*
imagination
.
It
was
the
imagination
that
set
remorse
to
dog
the
feet
*NL*
of
sin
.
It
was
the
imagination
that
made
each
crime
bear
its
misshapen
*NL*
brood
.
In
the
common
world
of
fact
the
wicked
were
not
punished
,
nor
*NL*
the
good
rewarded
.
Success
was
given
to
the
strong
,
failure
thrust
*NL*
upon
the
weak
.
That
was
all
.
Besides
,
had
any
stranger
been
prowling
*NL*
round
the
house
,
he
would
have
been
seen
by
the
servants
or
the
*NL*
keepers
.
Had
any
foot-marks
been
found
on
the
flower-beds
,
the
*NL*
gardeners
would
have
reported
it
.
Yes
,
it
had
been
merely
fancy
.
*NL*
Sibyl
Vane
's
brother
had
not
come
back
to
kill
him
.
He
had
sailed
away
*NL*
in
his
ship
to
founder
in
some
winter
sea
.
From
him
,
at
any
rate
,
he
*NL*
was
safe
.
Why
,
the
man
did
not
know
who
he
was
,
could
not
know
who
he
*NL*
was
.
The
mask
of
youth
had
saved
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
if
it
had
been
merely
an
illusion
,
how
terrible
it
was
to
think
*NL*
that
conscience
could
raise
such
fearful
phantoms
,
and
give
them
*NL*
visible
form
,
and
make
them
move
before
one
!
What
sort
of
life
would
*NL*
his
be
if
,
day
and
night
,
shadows
of
his
crime
were
to
peer
at
him
from
*NL*
silent
corners
,
to
mock
him
from
secret
places
,
to
whisper
in
his
ear
*NL*
as
he
sat
at
the
feast
,
to
wake
him
with
icy
fingers
as
he
lay
asleep
!
*NL*
As
the
thought
crept
through
his
brain
,
he
grew
pale
with
terror
,
and
*NL*
the
air
seemed
to
him
to
have
become
suddenly
colder
.
Oh
!
in
what
a
*NL*
wild
hour
of
madness
he
had
killed
his
friend
!
How
ghastly
the
mere
*NL*
memory
of
the
scene
!
He
saw
it
all
again
.
Each
hideous
detail
came
*NL*
back
to
him
with
added
horror
.
Out
of
the
black
cave
of
time
,
terrible
*NL*
and
swathed
in
scarlet
,
rose
the
image
of
his
sin
.
When
Lord
Henry
*NL*
came
in
at
six
o'clock
,
he
found
him
crying
as
one
whose
heart
will
*NL*
break
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
the
third
day
that
he
ventured
to
go
out
.
There
was
*NL*
something
in
the
clear
,
pine-scented
air
of
that
winter
morning
that
*NL*
seemed
to
bring
him
back
his
joyousness
and
his
ardour
for
life
.
But
*NL*
it
was
not
merely
the
physical
conditions
of
environment
that
had
*NL*
caused
the
change
.
His
own
nature
had
revolted
against
the
excess
of
*NL*
anguish
that
had
sought
to
maim
and
mar
the
perfection
of
its
calm
.
*NL*
With
subtle
and
finely
wrought
temperaments
it
is
always
so
.
Their
*NL*
strong
passions
must
either
bruise
or
bend
.
They
either
slay
the
man
,
*NL*
or
themselves
die
.
Shallow
sorrows
and
shallow
loves
live
on
.
The
*NL*
loves
and
sorrows
that
are
great
are
destroyed
by
their
own
plenitude
.
*NL*
Besides
,
he
had
convinced
himself
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
a
*NL*
terror-stricken
imagination
,
and
looked
back
now
on
his
fears
with
*NL*
something
of
pity
and
not
a
little
of
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
,
he
walked
with
the
duchess
for
an
hour
in
the
garden
*NL*
and
then
drove
across
the
park
to
join
the
shooting-party
.
The
crisp
*NL*
frost
lay
like
salt
upon
the
grass
.
The
sky
was
an
inverted
cup
of
*NL*
blue
metal
.
A
thin
film
of
ice
bordered
the
flat
,
reed-grown
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
corner
of
the
pine-wood
he
caught
sight
of
Sir
Geoffrey
*NL*
Clouston
,
the
duchess
's
brother
,
jerking
two
spent
cartridges
out
of
*NL*
his
gun
.
He
jumped
from
the
cart
,
and
having
told
the
groom
to
take
*NL*
the
mare
home
,
made
his
way
towards
his
guest
through
the
withered
*NL*
bracken
and
rough
undergrowth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
had
good
sport
,
Geoffrey
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
good
,
Dorian
.
I
think
most
of
the
birds
have
gone
to
the
*NL*
open
.
I
dare
say
it
will
be
better
after
lunch
,
when
we
get
to
new
*NL*
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
strolled
along
by
his
side
.
The
keen
aromatic
air
,
the
brown
*NL*
and
red
lights
that
glimmered
in
the
wood
,
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
*NL*
beaters
ringing
out
from
time
to
time
,
and
the
sharp
snaps
of
the
guns
*NL*
that
followed
,
fascinated
him
and
filled
him
with
a
sense
of
delightful
*NL*
freedom
.
He
was
dominated
by
the
carelessness
of
happiness
,
by
the
*NL*
high
indifference
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
from
a
lumpy
tussock
of
old
grass
some
twenty
yards
in
front
*NL*
of
them
,
with
black-tipped
ears
erect
and
long
hinder
limbs
throwing
it
*NL*
forward
,
started
a
hare
.
It
bolted
for
a
thicket
of
alders
.
Sir
*NL*
Geoffrey
put
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
,
but
there
was
something
in
the
*NL*
animal
's
grace
of
movement
that
strangely
charmed
Dorian
Gray
,
and
he
*NL*
cried
out
at
once
,
``
Do
n't
shoot
it
,
Geoffrey
.
Let
it
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
,
Dorian
!
''
laughed
his
companion
,
and
as
the
hare
bounded
*NL*
into
the
thicket
,
he
fired
.
There
were
two
cries
heard
,
the
cry
of
a
*NL*
hare
in
pain
,
which
is
dreadful
,
the
cry
of
a
man
in
agony
,
which
is
*NL*
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
I
have
hit
a
beater
!
''
exclaimed
Sir
Geoffrey
.
``
What
an
*NL*
ass
the
man
was
to
get
in
front
of
the
guns
!
Stop
shooting
there
!
''
he
*NL*
called
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
``
A
man
is
hurt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
head-keeper
came
running
up
with
a
stick
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
,
sir
?
Where
is
he
?
''
he
shouted
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
firing
*NL*
ceased
along
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
answered
Sir
Geoffrey
angrily
,
hurrying
towards
the
thicket
.
*NL*
``
Why
on
earth
do
n't
you
keep
your
men
back
?
Spoiled
my
shooting
for
*NL*
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
watched
them
as
they
plunged
into
the
alder-clump
,
brushing
the
*NL*
lithe
swinging
branches
aside
.
In
a
few
moments
they
emerged
,
dragging
*NL*
a
body
after
them
into
the
sunlight
.
He
turned
away
in
horror
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
misfortune
followed
wherever
he
went
.
He
heard
Sir
*NL*
Geoffrey
ask
if
the
man
was
really
dead
,
and
the
affirmative
answer
of
*NL*
the
keeper
.
The
wood
seemed
to
him
to
have
become
suddenly
alive
with
*NL*
faces
.
There
was
the
trampling
of
myriad
feet
and
the
low
buzz
of
*NL*
voices
.
A
great
copper-breasted
pheasant
came
beating
through
the
*NL*
boughs
overhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
moments
--
that
were
to
him
,
in
his
perturbed
state
,
like
*NL*
endless
hours
of
pain
--
he
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
.
He
started
*NL*
and
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dorian
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
``
I
had
better
tell
them
that
the
shooting
is
*NL*
stopped
for
to-day
.
It
would
not
look
well
to
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
it
were
stopped
for
ever
,
Harry
,
''
he
answered
bitterly
.
``
The
*NL*
whole
thing
is
hideous
and
cruel
.
Is
the
man
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
finish
the
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
so
,
''
rejoined
Lord
Henry
.
``
He
got
the
whole
charge
of
*NL*
shot
in
his
chest
.
He
must
have
died
almost
instantaneously
.
Come
;
*NL*
let
us
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
side
by
side
in
the
direction
of
the
avenue
for
nearly
*NL*
fifty
yards
without
speaking
.
Then
Dorian
looked
at
Lord
Henry
and
*NL*
said
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
``
It
is
a
bad
omen
,
Harry
,
a
very
bad
omen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
?
''
asked
Lord
Henry
.
``
Oh
!
this
accident
,
I
suppose
.
My
dear
*NL*
fellow
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
It
was
the
man
's
own
fault
.
Why
did
he
*NL*
get
in
front
of
the
guns
?
Besides
,
it
is
nothing
to
us
.
It
is
rather
*NL*
awkward
for
Geoffrey
,
of
course
.
It
does
not
do
to
pepper
beaters
.
It
*NL*
makes
people
think
that
one
is
a
wild
shot
.
And
Geoffrey
is
not
;
he
*NL*
shoots
very
straight
.
But
there
is
no
use
talking
about
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
shook
his
head
.
``
It
is
a
bad
omen
,
Harry
.
I
feel
as
if
*NL*
something
horrible
were
going
to
happen
to
some
of
us
.
To
myself
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
''
he
added
,
passing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
,
with
a
gesture
of
*NL*
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
man
laughed
.
``
The
only
horrible
thing
in
the
world
is
_
ennui
_
,
*NL*
Dorian
.
That
is
the
one
sin
for
which
there
is
no
forgiveness
.
But
we
*NL*
are
not
likely
to
suffer
from
it
unless
these
fellows
keep
chattering
*NL*
about
this
thing
at
dinner
.
I
must
tell
them
that
the
subject
is
to
be
*NL*
tabooed
.
As
for
omens
,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
omen
.
Destiny
*NL*
does
not
send
us
heralds
.
She
is
too
wise
or
too
cruel
for
that
.
*NL*
Besides
,
what
on
earth
could
happen
to
you
,
Dorian
?
You
have
*NL*
everything
in
the
world
that
a
man
can
want
.
There
is
no
one
who
would
*NL*
not
be
delighted

*NL*
``
There

no

I

not

Harry

Do
n't
*NL*
laugh
like
that
.
I
am
telling
you
the
truth

The
wretched
peasant
who
*NL*
has
just
died
is
better
off
than
I
am

I
have
no
terror
of
death

It
*NL*
is
the
coming
of
death
that
terrifies
me
.
Its
monstrous
wings
seem
to
*NL*
wheel
in
the
leaden
air
around
me
.
Good
heavens
!
do
n't
you
see
a
man
*NL*
moving
behind
the
trees
there
,
watching
me
,
waiting
for
me
?

*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
the
trembling
gloved
hand
*NL*
was
pointing
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
,
``
I
see
the
gardener
waiting
for
*NL*
you

I
suppose
he
wants
to
ask
you
what
flowers
you
wish
to
have
on
*NL*
the
table
to-night
.
How
absurdly
nervous
you
are
,
my
dear
fellow
!
You
*NL*
must
come
and
see
my
doctor
,
when
we
get
back
to
town

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
saw
the
gardener
approaching
.
The
*NL*
man
touched
his
hat
,
glanced
for
a
moment
at
Lord
Henry
in
a
hesitating
*NL*
manner
,
and
then
produced
a
letter
,
which
he
handed
to
his
master
.
*NL*
``
Her
Grace
told
me
to
wait
for
an
answer
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
.
``
Tell
her
Grace
that
I
am
*NL*
coming
in

''
he
said
,
coldly
.
The
man
turned
round
and
went
rapidly
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fond
women
are
of
doing
dangerous
things
!
''
laughed
Lord
Henry
.
*NL*
``
It
is
one
of
the
qualities
in
them
that
I
admire
most
.
A
woman
will
*NL*
flirt
with

in
the
world
as
long
as
other
people
are
looking

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fond
you

of
saying
dangerous

Harry

In

I
like

very
much

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the

*NL*
``
You

``

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

cried
Dorian
Gray
with
a
deep
note
of
pathos
in
*NL*
his
voice
.
``
But
I
seem
to
have
lost
the
passion

My

has
*NL*
become
a
burden

me

I
want
to
escape

to
go
away

It

was
silly
of
me

come
down
here

*NL*

he
answered
sadly

``

I

terribly
upset

it

*NL*

Yes

curious

I

It
looked
the

I

am
sorry

broke
in
Lord

*NL*
Dorian
drew
himself
up
with
an
effort
and
smiled
.
``
It

nothing

*NL*
Duchess

he
murmured
;
``
my
nerves

dreadfully
out
of

all

this

I
did

very
bad

*NL*
*NL*
They
had
reached
the
great
flight
of
steps
that
led
from
the
*NL*
conservatory
on
to
the
terrace
.
As
the
glass
door
closed
behind
*NL*
Dorian
,
Lord
Henry
turned
and
looked
at
the
duchess
with
his
slumberous
*NL*
eyes
.
``
Are
you
very
much
in
love
with
him

he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
for
some
time
,
but
stood
gazing
at
the
landscape
.
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
knew
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
.
``
Knowledge
would
be
fatal

It

*NL*
*NL*
``
Disillusion

``

Lord

``

He
glanced
about
as
if
in
search
of
something
.
``
What
are
you
looking
*NL*
for
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
button
from

he
answered
.
``
You

dropped

*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
.
``
I
have
still
the
mask

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes

was
his
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
again

Her
teeth
showed
like
white
seeds
in
a
scarlet
*NL*
fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upstairs
,
in
his
own
room
,
Dorian
Gray
was
lying
on
a
sofa
,
with
terror
*NL*
in
every
tingling
fibre
of
his
body
.
Life
had
suddenly
become
too
*NL*
hideous
a
burden
for
him
to
bear
.
The
dreadful
death
of
the
unlucky
*NL*
beater
,
shot
in
the
thicket
like
a
wild
animal
,
had
seemed
to
him
to
*NL*
pre-figure
death
for
himself
also
.
He
had
nearly
swooned
at
what
Lord
*NL*
Henry
had
said
in
a
chance
mood
of
cynical
jesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
five
o'clock
he
rang
his
bell
for
his
servant
and
gave
him
orders
to
*NL*
pack
his
things
for
the
night-express
to
town
,
and
to
have
the
brougham
*NL*
at
the
door
by
eight-thirty
.
He
was
determined
not
to
sleep
another
*NL*
night
at
Selby
Royal
.
It
was
an
ill-omened
place
.
Death
walked
there
*NL*
in
the
sunlight
.
The
grass
of
the
forest
had
been
spotted
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
wrote
a
note
to
Lord
Henry
,
telling
him
that
he
was
going
up
to
*NL*
town
to
consult
his
doctor
and
asking
him
to
entertain
his
guests
in
*NL*
his
absence
.
As
he
was
putting
it
into
the
envelope
,
a
knock
came
to
*NL*
the
door
,
and
his
valet
informed
him
that
the
head-keeper
wished
to
see
*NL*
him
.
He
frowned
and
bit
his
lip
.
``
Send
him
in
,
''
he
muttered
,
after
*NL*
some
moments
'
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
man
entered
,
Dorian
pulled
his
chequebook
out
of
a
*NL*
drawer
and
spread
it
out
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
have
come
about
the
unfortunate
accident
of
this
*NL*
morning
,
Thornton
?
''
he
said
,
taking
up
a
pen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
gamekeeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
the
poor
fellow
married
?
Had
he
any
people
dependent
on
him
?
''
*NL*
asked
Dorian
,
looking
bored
.
``
If
so
,
I
should
not
like
them
to
be
left
*NL*
in
want
,
and
will
send
them
any
sum
of
money
you
may
think
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
know
who
he
is

That
is
what
I
took
the
liberty
of
*NL*
coming
to
you
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
who
he
is

said
Dorian
,
listlessly
.
``
What
do
you
mean

*NL*
Was
n't
he
one
of
your
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
Never
saw
him
before

Seems
like
a
sailor
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pen
dropped
from
Dorian
Gray
's
hand
,
and
he
felt
as
if
his
heart
*NL*
had
suddenly
stopped
beating
.
``
A
sailor
?
''
he
cried
out
.
``
Did
you
say
*NL*
a
sailor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
He
looks
as
if
he
had
been
a
sort
of
sailor
;
tattooed
on
*NL*
both
arms
,
and
that
kind
of
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
there
anything
found
on
him
?
''
said
Dorian
,
leaning
forward
and
*NL*
looking
at
the
man
with
startled
eyes
.
``
Anything
that
would
tell
his
*NL*
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
money
,
sir
--
not
much
,
and
a
six-shooter
.
There
was
no
name
of
any
*NL*
kind
.
A
decent-looking
man
,
sir
,
but
rough-like
.
A
sort
of
sailor
we
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
started
to
his
feet
.
A
terrible
hope
fluttered
past
him
.
He
*NL*
clutched
at
it
madly
.
``
Where
is
the
body
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Quick
!
I
*NL*
must
see
it
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
in
an
empty
stable
in
the
Home
Farm
,
sir
.
The
folk
do
n't
like
*NL*
to
have
that
sort
of
thing
in
their
houses
.
They
say
a
corpse
brings
*NL*
bad
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Home
Farm
!
Go
there
at
once
and
meet
me
.
Tell
one
of
the
grooms
*NL*
to
bring
my
horse
round
.
No
.
Never
mind
.
I
'll
go
to
the
stables
*NL*
myself
.
It
will
save
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
Dorian
Gray
was
galloping
down
the
*NL*
long
avenue
as
hard
as
he
could
go
.
The
trees
seemed
to
sweep
past
him
*NL*
in
spectral
procession
,
and
wild
shadows
to
fling
themselves
across
his
*NL*
path
.
Once
the
mare
swerved
at
a
white
gate-post
and
nearly
threw
him
.
*NL*
He
lashed
her
across
the
neck
with
his
crop
.
She
cleft
the
dusky
air
*NL*
like
an
arrow
.
The
stones
flew
from
her
hoofs
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
reached
the
Home
Farm
.
Two
men
were
loitering
in
the
yard
.
*NL*
He
leaped
from
the
saddle
and
threw
the
reins
to
one
of
them
.
In
the
*NL*
farthest
stable
a
light
was
glimmering
.
Something
seemed
to
tell
him
*NL*
that
the
body
was
there
,
and
he
hurried
to
the
door
and
put
his
hand
*NL*
upon
the
latch
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
paused
for
a
moment
,
feeling
that
he
was
on
the
brink
of
a
*NL*
discovery
that
would
either
make
or
mar
his
life
.
Then
he
thrust
the
*NL*
door
open
and
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
heap
of
sacking
in
the
far
corner
was
lying
the
dead
body
of
a
man
*NL*
dressed
in
a
coarse
shirt
and
a
pair
of
blue
trousers
.
A
spotted
*NL*
handkerchief
had
been
placed
over
the
face
.
A
coarse
candle
,
stuck
in
*NL*
a
bottle
,
sputtered
beside
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
shuddered
.
He
felt
that
his
could
not
be
the
hand
to
take
*NL*
the
handkerchief
away
,
and
called
out
to
one
of
the
farm-servants
to
*NL*
come
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
that
thing
off
the
face
.
I
wish
to
see
it
,
''
he
said
,
clutching
*NL*
at
the
door-post
for
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
farm-servant
had
done
so
,
he
stepped
forward
.
A
cry
of
joy
*NL*
broke
from
his
lips
.
The
man
who
had
been
shot
in
the
thicket
was
*NL*
James
Vane
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
there
for
some
minutes
looking
at
the
dead
body
.
As
he
rode
*NL*
home
,
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
,
for
he
knew
he
was
safe
.

Lord

smiling

anybody

There

That

the
reason

live
out

are
so
absolutely
uncivilized

*NL*
Civilization

not

There
are

only
two

One
is
by

*NL*

echoed
Dorian

asked
his
companion
as
he
spilled
into
his
*NL*
plate
a
little
crimson
pyramid
of
seeded
strawberries
and
,
through
a
*NL*
perforated
,
shell-shaped
spoon
,
snowed
white
sugar
upon
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell

It
is
not
a

I
could
tell

I
spared
somebody
.
It
sounds
vain
,
but
you
understand
what
I
*NL*
mean
.
She
was
quite
beautiful
and
wonderfully
like
Sibyl
Vane
.
I
*NL*
think
it
was
that
which
first
attracted
me
to
her
.
You
remember
Sibyl
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
?
How
long
ago
that
seems
!
Well
,
Hetty
was
not
one
of
our
*NL*
own
class
,
of
course
.
She
was
simply
a
girl
in
a
village
.
But
I
*NL*
really
loved
her
.
I
am
quite
sure
that
I
loved
her
.
All
during
this
*NL*
wonderful
May
that
we
have
been
having
,
I
used
to
run
down
and
see
her
*NL*
two
or
three
times
a
week
.
Yesterday
she
met
me
in
a
little
orchard
.
*NL*
The
apple-blossoms
kept
tumbling
down
on
her
hair
,
and
she
was
*NL*
laughing
.
We
were
to
have
gone
away
together
this
morning
at
dawn
.
*NL*
Suddenly
I
determined
to
leave
her
as
flowerlike
as
I
had
found
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

interrupted
Lord
Henry

``
But
I
can
finish

is
not
broken

Of
course
,
she
cried
and
all
that
.
But
*NL*
there
is
no
disgrace
upon
her
.
She
can
live
,
like
Perdita
,
in
her
*NL*
garden
of
mint
and
marigold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
weep
over
a
faithless
Florizel

said
Lord
Henry
,
laughing
,
as
he
*NL*
leaned
back
in
his
chair
.
``
My

Dorian

you
have
the

Do
you

this

will
ever
be
really
content
now
*NL*
with
any
one
of
her

rank

I
suppose
she
will
be
married
some
day
*NL*
to
a
rough
carter

a
grinning
ploughman

Well
,
the
fact
of
having
*NL*
met
you
,
and
loved
you
,
will
teach
her
to
despise
her
husband
,
and
she
*NL*
will
be
wretched

From
a
moral
point
of
view
,
I
can
not
say
that
I
*NL*
think
much
of
your
great
renunciation
.
Even
as
a
beginning
,
it
is
*NL*
poor
.
Besides

how
do
you
know
that
Hetty
is
n't
floating
at
the
*NL*
present
moment
in
some
starlit
mill-pond

with
lovely
water-lilies
*NL*
round
her

like
Ophelia

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

mock
at

I

As
I
rode
past
the
farm
this
morning
,
I
saw
her
white
face
at

the
window
,
like
a
spray
of
jasmine

Do

us
talk
about
it
any

do
n't
try
to
persuade
me

I
have

done
for
years

the
first
little
bit
of
self-sacrifice
I

slightly

really
not

more

They

Now

left

on

poor

the
French

declare
that
Basil
never
arrived
in

at
all
.
I
suppose
in
about
a
fortnight
we
shall
be
told

It

an
odd

asked
Dorian
,
holding
up
his

Burgundy
against

and
wondering
how
it
was

calmly

I

passing
beneath

the
gilt

trellis
of

box

``

most

*NL*
Dorian
said
nothing

rose
from
the
table
,
and
passing
into
the
next
*NL*
room
,
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
let
his
fingers
stray
across
the
white
*NL*
and
black
ivory
of
the
keys
.
After
the
coffee
had
been
brought
in
,
he
*NL*
stopped
,
and
looking
over
at
Lord
Henry
,
said
,
``
Harry
,
did
it
ever
*NL*
occur
to
you
that
Basil
was
murdered

*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
yawned
.
``
Basil
was
very
popular

always
wore
a
*NL*
Waterbury
watch

Why
should
he
have
been
murdered

He
was
not
clever
*NL*
enough
to
have
enemies

Of
course

he
had
a
wonderful
genius
for
*NL*
painting

But
a
man
can
paint
like
Velasquez
and
yet
be
as
dull
as
*NL*
possible

Basil
was
really
rather
dull

He
only
interested
me
once

*NL*

that
was
when
he
told
me
,
years
ago
,
that
he
had
a
wild
adoration

for
you
and
that
you
were
the
dominant
motive

his
art

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was

Dorian

a
note

Oh

I
know
there
are
dreadful
places
in
Paris

Basil
was
not
*NL*
the
sort
of
man
to
have
gone

no
curiosity

It
was
his

conductor
hushed
up

scandal

Yes

those
dull-green
waters

heavy
barges

long
weeds

in

Do
you
know

think
he
would
have
done
much
more
good
work

During
the
last
*NL*
ten
years
his
painting
had
gone
off
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
heaved
a
sigh
,
and
Lord
Henry
strolled
across
the
room
and
began
*NL*
to
stroke
the
head
of
a
curious
Java
parrot
,
a
large
,
grey-plumaged
*NL*
bird
with
pink
crest
and
tail
,
that
was
balancing
itself
upon
a
bamboo
*NL*
perch
.
As
his
pointed
fingers
touched
it
,
it
dropped
the
white
scurf
*NL*
of
crinkled
lids
over
black
,
glasslike
eyes
and
began
to
sway
backwards
*NL*
and
forwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
continued
,
turning
round
and
taking
his
handkerchief
out
of
*NL*
his
pocket
;
``
his
painting
had
quite
gone
off

It
seemed
to
me
to
have
*NL*
lost
something

It
had
lost
an
ideal

When
you
and
he
ceased
to
be
*NL*
great
friends
,
he
ceased
to
be
a
great
artist

What
was
it
separated
*NL*
you
?
I
suppose
he
bored
you
.
If
so
,
he
never
forgave
you

It

a

habit
bores
have

By
the
way
,
what
has
become
of
that
wonderful
*NL*
portrait
he
did
of
you
?
I
do
n't
think
I
have
ever
seen
it
since
he
*NL*
finished
it
.
Oh
!
I
remember
your
telling
me
years
ago
that
you
had
*NL*
sent
it
down
to
Selby

and
that
it
had
got
mislaid

stolen
on

I
remember
I
wanted
to
buy
it

I
wish
I
had
now
.
It
*NL*
belonged
to
Basil
's
best
period
.
Since
then
,
his
work
was
that
curious
*NL*
mixture
of
bad
painting
and
good
intentions
that
always
entitles
a
man
*NL*
to
be
called

*NL*
Yes
:
that
is
what
it
was
like

*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Henry
laughed
.
``
If
a
man
treats
life
artistically
,
his
brain
is
*NL*
his
heart

''
he
answered
,
sinking
into
an
arm-chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
Gray
shook
his
head
and
struck
some
soft
chords
on
the
piano
.
*NL*
''
`
Like
the
painting
of
a
sorrow
,
'
''
he
repeated
,
''
'
a
face
without
a
*NL*
heart
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
man
lay
back
and
looked
at
him
with
half-closed
eyes
.
``
By
*NL*
the
way
,
Dorian
,
''
he
said
after
a
pause
,
''
`
what
does
it
profit
a
man
if
*NL*
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
--
how
does
the
quotation
run
?
--
his
own
*NL*
soul
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
music
jarred
,
and
Dorian
Gray
started
and
stared
at
his
friend
.
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
ask
me
that
,
Harry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Lord
Henry
,
elevating
his
eyebrows
in
surprise
,
*NL*
``
I
asked
you
because
I
thought
you
might
be
able
to
give
me
an
answer
.
*NL*
That
is
all
.
I
was
going
through
the
park
last
Sunday
,
and
close
by
*NL*
the
Marble
Arch
there
stood
a
little
crowd
of
shabby-looking
people
*NL*
listening
to
some
vulgar
street-preacher
.
As
I
passed
by
,
I
heard
the
*NL*
man
yelling
out
that
question
to
his
audience
.
It
struck
me
as
being
*NL*
rather
dramatic
.
London
is
very
rich
in
curious
effects
of
that
kind
.
*NL*
A
wet
Sunday
,
an
uncouth
Christian
in
a
mackintosh
,
a
ring
of
sickly
*NL*
white
faces
under
a
broken
roof
of
dripping
umbrellas
,
and
a
wonderful
*NL*
phrase
flung
into
the
air
by
shrill
hysterical
lips
--
it
was
really
very
*NL*
good
in
its
way
,
quite
a
suggestion
.
I
thought
of
telling
the
prophet
*NL*
that
art
had
a
soul
,
but
that
man
had
not
.
I
am
afraid
,
however
,
he
*NL*
would
not
have
understood
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
Harry
.
The
soul
is
a
terrible
reality
.
It
can
be
bought
,
and
*NL*
sold
,
and
bartered
away
.
It
can
be
poisoned
,
or
made
perfect
.
There
*NL*
is
a
soul
in
each
one
of
us
.
I
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
feel
quite
sure
of
that
,
Dorian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
then
it
must
be
an
illusion
.
The
things
one
feels
absolutely
*NL*
certain
about
are
never
true
.
That
is
the
fatality
of
faith
,
and
the
*NL*
lesson
of
romance
.
How
grave
you
are
!
Do
n't
be
so
serious
.
What
have
*NL*
you
or
I
to
do
with
the
superstitions
of
our
age
?
No
:
we
have
given
*NL*
up
our
belief
in
the
soul
.
Play
me
something
.
Play
me
a
nocturne
,
*NL*
Dorian
,
and
,
as
you
play
,
tell
me
,
in
a
low
voice
,
how
you
have
kept
*NL*
your
youth
.
You
must
have
some
secret
.
I
am
only
ten
years
older
than
*NL*
you
are
,
and
I
am
wrinkled
,
and
worn
,
and
yellow
.
You
are
really
*NL*
wonderful
,
Dorian
.
You
have
never
looked
more
charming
than
you
do
*NL*
to-night
.
You
remind
me
of
the
day
I
saw
you
first
.
You
were
rather
*NL*
cheeky
,
very
shy
,
and
absolutely
extraordinary
.
You
have
changed
,
of
*NL*
course
,
but
not
in
appearance
.
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
your
secret
.
*NL*
To
get
back
my
youth
I
would
do
anything
in
the
world
,
except
take
*NL*
exercise
,
get
up
early
,
or
be
respectable
.
Youth
!
There
is
nothing
*NL*
like
it
.
It
's
absurd
to
talk
of
the
ignorance
of
youth
.
The
only
*NL*
people
to
whose
opinions
I
listen
now
with
any
respect
are
people
much
*NL*
younger
than
myself
.
They
seem
in
front
of
me
.
Life
has
revealed
to
*NL*
them
her
latest
wonder
.
As
for
the
aged
,
I
always
contradict
the
aged
.
*NL*
I
do
it
on
principle
.
If
you
ask
them
their
opinion
on
something
that
*NL*
happened
yesterday
,
they
solemnly
give
you
the
opinions
current
in
*NL*
1820
,
when
people
wore
high
stocks
,
believed
in
everything
,
and
knew
*NL*
absolutely
nothing
.
How
lovely
that
thing
you
are
playing
is
!
I
*NL*
wonder
,
did
Chopin
write
it
at
Majorca
,
with
the
sea
weeping
round
the
*NL*
villa
and
the
salt
spray
dashing
against
the
panes
?
It
is
marvellously
*NL*
romantic
.
What
a
blessing
it
is
that
there
is
one
art
left
to
us
that
*NL*
is
not
imitative
!
Do
n't
stop
.
I
want
music
to-night
.
It
seems
to
me
*NL*
that
you
are
the
young
Apollo
and
that
I
am
Marsyas
listening
to
you
.
*NL*
I
have
sorrows
,
Dorian
,
of
my
own
,
that
even
you
know
nothing
of
.
The
*NL*
tragedy
of
old
age
is
not
that
one
is
old
,
but
that
one
is
young
.
I
am
*NL*
amazed
sometimes
at
my
own
sincerity
.
Ah
,
Dorian
,
how
happy
you
are
!
*NL*
What
an
exquisite
life
you
have
had
!
You
have
drunk
deeply
of
*NL*
everything
.
You
have
crushed
the
grapes
against
your
palate
.
Nothing
*NL*
has
been
hidden
from
you
.
And
it
has
all
been
to
you
no
more
than
the
*NL*
sound
of
music
.
It
has
not
marred
you
.
You
are
still
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
the
same
,
Harry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
the
same
.
I
wonder
what
the
rest
of
your
life
will
be
.
*NL*
Do
n't
spoil
it
by
renunciations
.
At
present
you
are
a
perfect
type
.
*NL*
Do
n't
make
yourself
incomplete
.
You
are
quite
flawless
now
.
You
need
*NL*
not
shake
your
head
:
you
know
you
are
.
Besides
,
Dorian
,
do
n't
deceive
*NL*
yourself
.
Life
is
not
governed
by
will
or
intention
.
Life
is
a
*NL*
question
of
nerves
,
and
fibres
,
and
slowly
built-up
cells
in
which
*NL*
thought
hides
itself
and
passion
has
its
dreams
.
You
may
fancy
*NL*
yourself
safe
and
think
yourself
strong
.
But
a
chance
tone
of
colour
*NL*
in
a
room
or
a
morning
sky
,
a
particular
perfume
that
you
had
once
*NL*
loved
and
that
brings
subtle
memories
with
it
,
a
line
from
a
forgotten
*NL*
poem
that
you
had
come
across
again
,
a
cadence
from
a
piece
of
music
*NL*
that
you
had
ceased
to
play
--
I
tell
you
,
Dorian
,
that
it
is
on
things
*NL*
like
these
that
our
lives
depend
.
Browning
writes
about
that
*NL*
somewhere
;
but
our
own
senses
will
imagine
them
for
us
.
There
are
*NL*
moments
when
the
odour
of
_
lilas
blanc
_
passes
suddenly
across
me
,
and
I
*NL*
have
to
live
the
strangest
month
of
my
life
over
again
.
I
wish
I
could
*NL*
change
places
with
you
,
Dorian
.
The
world
has
cried
out
against
us
*NL*
both
,
but
it
has
always
worshipped
you
.
It
always
will
worship
you
.
*NL*
You
are
the
type
of
what
the
age
is
searching
for
,
and
what
it
is
*NL*
afraid
it
has
found
.
I
am
so
glad
that
you
have
never
done
anything
,
*NL*
never
carved
a
statue
,
or
painted
a
picture
,
or
produced
anything
*NL*
outside
of
yourself
!
Life
has
been
your
art
.
You
have
set
yourself
to
*NL*
music
.
Your
days
are
your
sonnets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dorian
rose
up
from
the
piano
and
passed
his
hand
through
his
hair
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
life
has
been
exquisite
,
''
he
murmured
,
``
but
I
am
not
going
to
*NL*
have
the
same
life

Harry

And
you
must
not

these
extravagant
*NL*
things
to

You
do

everything
about

I
think
that

even
you

``
Why
have
you
stopped

Go
back

give
me
the

nocturne
over
again

Look
at
that
great
,
honey-coloured
moon
that
*NL*
hangs
in
the
dusky
air

She
is
waiting
for
you

charm
her

will
come
closer

Let

go

the
club

It
has
been
a
charming
evening

we
must
end
it

charmingly

There
is
some
one
at
White

who
wants
immensely
to
know
*NL*
you

young
Lord
Poole
,
Bournemouth
's
eldest
son

He
has
already
copied
*NL*
your
neckties

and
has
begged
me

introduce

you

quite

delightful

rather
reminds

sad

tired

there

no
such
thing

Art
has
no
influence

annihilates

desire

act

It
is
superbly
sterile

CHAPTER
20
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lovely
night
,
so
warm
that
he
threw
his
coat
over
his
arm
and
*NL*
did
not
even
put
his
silk
scarf
round
his
throat
.
As
he
strolled
home
,
*NL*
smoking
his
cigarette
,
two
young
men
in
evening
dress
passed
him
.
He
*NL*
heard
one
of
them
whisper
to
the
other
,
``
That
is
Dorian
Gray
.
''
He
*NL*
remembered
how
pleased
he
used
to
be
when
he
was
pointed
out
,
or
stared
*NL*
at
,
or
talked
about
.
He
was
tired
of
hearing
his
own
name
now
.
Half
*NL*
the
charm
of
the
little
village
where
he
had
been
so
often
lately
was
*NL*
that
no
one
knew
who
he
was
.
He
had
often
told
the
girl
whom
he
had
*NL*
lured
to
love
him
that
he
was
poor
,
and
she
had
believed
him
.
He
had
*NL*
told
her
once
that
he
was
wicked
,
and
she
had
laughed
at
him
and
*NL*
answered
that
wicked
people
were
always
very
old
and
very
ugly
.
What
a
*NL*
laugh
she
had
!
--
just
like
a
thrush
singing
.
And
how
pretty
she
had
*NL*
been
in
her
cotton
dresses
and
her
large
hats
!
She
knew
nothing
,
but
*NL*
she
had
everything
that
he
had
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
home
,
he
found
his
servant
waiting
up
for
him
.
He
sent
*NL*
him
to
bed
,
and
threw
himself
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
library
,
and
*NL*
began
to
think
over
some
of
the
things
that
Lord
Henry
had
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
really
true
that
one
could
never
change
?
He
felt
a
wild
longing
*NL*
for
the
unstained
purity
of
his
boyhood
--
his
rose-white
boyhood
,
as
*NL*
Lord
Henry
had
once
called
it
.
He
knew
that
he
had
tarnished
himself
,
*NL*
filled
his
mind
with
corruption
and
given
horror
to
his
fancy
;
that
he
*NL*
had
been
an
evil
influence
to
others
,
and
had
experienced
a
terrible
*NL*
joy
in
being
so
;
and
that
of
the
lives
that
had
crossed
his
own
,
it
had
*NL*
been
the
fairest
and
the
most
full
of
promise
that
he
had
brought
to
*NL*
shame
.
But
was
it
all
irretrievable
?
Was
there
no
hope
for
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
!
in
what
a
monstrous
moment
of
pride
and
passion
he
had
prayed
that
*NL*
the
portrait
should
bear
the
burden
of
his
days
,
and
he
keep
the
*NL*
unsullied
splendour
of
eternal
youth
!
All
his
failure
had
been
due
to
*NL*
that
.
Better
for
him
that
each
sin
of
his
life
had
brought
its
sure
*NL*
swift
penalty
along
with
it
.
There
was
purification
in
punishment
.
*NL*
Not
``
Forgive
us
our
sins
''
but
``
Smite
us
for
our
iniquities
''
should
be
*NL*
the
prayer
of
man
to
a
most
just
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curiously
carved
mirror
that
Lord
Henry
had
given
to
him
,
so
many
*NL*
years
ago
now
,
was
standing
on
the
table
,
and
the
white-limbed
Cupids
*NL*
laughed
round
it
as
of
old
.
He
took
it
up
,
as
he
had
done
on
that
*NL*
night
of
horror
when
he
had
first
noted
the
change
in
the
fatal
*NL*
picture
,
and
with
wild
,
tear-dimmed
eyes
looked
into
its
polished
*NL*
shield
.
Once
,
some
one
who
had
terribly
loved
him
had
written
to
him
a
*NL*
mad
letter
,
ending
with
these
idolatrous
words
:
``
The
world
is
changed
*NL*
because
you
are
made
of
ivory
and
gold
.
The
curves
of
your
lips
*NL*
rewrite
history
.
''
The
phrases
came
back
to
his
memory
,
and
he
repeated
*NL*
them
over
and
over
to
himself
.
Then
he
loathed
his
own
beauty
,
and
*NL*
flinging
the
mirror
on
the
floor
,
crushed
it
into
silver
splinters
*NL*
beneath
his
heel
.
It
was
his
beauty
that
had
ruined
him
,
his
beauty
*NL*
and
the
youth
that
he
had
prayed
for
.
But
for
those
two
things
,
his
*NL*
life
might
have
been
free
from
stain
.
His
beauty
had
been
to
him
but
a
*NL*
mask
,
his
youth
but
a
mockery
.
What
was
youth
at
best
?
A
green
,
an
*NL*
unripe
time
,
a
time
of
shallow
moods
,
and
sickly
thoughts
.
Why
had
he
*NL*
worn
its
livery
?
Youth
had
spoiled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
better
not
to
think
of
the
past
.
Nothing
could
alter
that
.
It
*NL*
was
of
himself
,
and
of
his
own
future
,
that
he
had
to
think
.
James
*NL*
Vane
was
hidden
in
a
nameless
grave
in
Selby
churchyard
.
Alan
Campbell
*NL*
had
shot
himself
one
night
in
his
laboratory
,
but
had
not
revealed
the
*NL*
secret
that
he
had
been
forced
to
know
.
The
excitement
,
such
as
it
*NL*
was
,
over
Basil
Hallward
's
disappearance
would
soon
pass
away
.
It
was
*NL*
already
waning
.
He
was
perfectly
safe
there
.
Nor
,
indeed
,
was
it
the
*NL*
death
of
Basil
Hallward
that
weighed
most
upon
his
mind
.
It
was
the
*NL*
living
death
of
his
own
soul
that
troubled
him
.
Basil
had
painted
the
*NL*
portrait
that
had
marred
his
life
.
He
could
not
forgive
him
that
.
It
*NL*
was
the
portrait
that
had
done
everything
.
Basil
had
said
things
to
*NL*
him
that
were
unbearable
,
and
that
he
had
yet
borne
with
patience
.
The
*NL*
murder
had
been
simply
the
madness
of
a
moment
.
As
for
Alan
Campbell
,
*NL*
his
suicide
had
been
his
own
act
.
He
had
chosen
to
do
it
.
It
was
*NL*
nothing
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
life
!
That
was
what
he
wanted
.
That
was
what
he
was
waiting
*NL*
for
.
Surely
he
had
begun
it
already
.
He
had
spared
one
innocent
*NL*
thing
,
at
any
rate
.
He
would
never
again
tempt
innocence
.
He
would
be
*NL*
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
thought
of
Hetty
Merton
,
he
began
to
wonder
if
the
portrait
in
*NL*
the
locked
room
had
changed
.
Surely
it
was
not
still
so
horrible
as
it
*NL*
had
been
?
Perhaps
if
his
life
became
pure
,
he
would
be
able
to
expel
*NL*
every
sign
of
evil
passion
from
the
face
.
Perhaps
the
signs
of
evil
*NL*
had
already
gone
away
.
He
would
go
and
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
lamp
from
the
table
and
crept
upstairs
.
As
he
unbarred
the
*NL*
door
,
a
smile
of
joy
flitted
across
his
strangely
young-looking
face
*NL*
and
lingered
for
a
moment
about
his
lips
.
Yes
,
he
would
be
good
,
and
*NL*
the
hideous
thing
that
he
had
hidden
away
would
no
longer
be
a
terror
*NL*
to
him
.
He
felt
as
if
the
load
had
been
lifted
from
him
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
in
quietly
,
locking
the
door
behind
him
,
as
was
his
custom
,
and
*NL*
dragged
the
purple
hanging
from
the
portrait
.
A
cry
of
pain
and
*NL*
indignation
broke
from
him
.
He
could
see
no
change
,
save
that
in
the
*NL*
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
cunning
and
in
the
mouth
the
curved
wrinkle
of
*NL*
the
hypocrite
.
The
thing
was
still
loathsome
--
more
loathsome
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
than
before
--
and
the
scarlet
dew
that
spotted
the
hand
seemed
*NL*
brighter
,
and
more
like
blood
newly
spilled
.
Then
he
trembled
.
Had
it
*NL*
been
merely
vanity
that
had
made
him
do
his
one
good
deed
?
Or
the
*NL*
desire
for
a
new
sensation
,
as
Lord
Henry
had
hinted
,
with
his
mocking
*NL*
laugh
?
Or
that
passion
to
act
a
part
that
sometimes
makes
us
do
things
*NL*
finer
than
we
are
ourselves
?
Or
,
perhaps
,
all
these
?
And
why
was
the
*NL*
red
stain
larger
than
it
had
been
?
It
seemed
to
have
crept
like
a
*NL*
horrible
disease
over
the
wrinkled
fingers
.
There
was
blood
on
the
*NL*
painted
feet
,
as
though
the
thing
had
dripped
--
blood
even
on
the
hand
*NL*
that
had
not
held
the
knife
.
Confess
?
Did
it
mean
that
he
was
to
*NL*
confess
?
To
give
himself
up
and
be
put
to
death
?
He
laughed
.
He
felt
*NL*
that
the
idea
was
monstrous
.
Besides
,
even
if
he
did
confess
,
who
*NL*
would
believe
him
?
There
was
no
trace
of
the
murdered
man
anywhere
.
*NL*
Everything
belonging
to
him
had
been
destroyed
.
He
himself
had
burned
*NL*
what
had
been
below-stairs
.
The
world
would
simply
say
that
he
was
mad
.
*NL*
They
would
shut
him
up
if
he
persisted
in
his
story
...
Yet
it
was
*NL*
his
duty
to
confess
,
to
suffer
public
shame
,
and
to
make
public
*NL*
atonement
.
There
was
a
God
who
called
upon
men
to
tell
their
sins
to
*NL*
earth
as
well
as
to
heaven
.
Nothing
that
he
could
do
would
cleanse
him
*NL*
till
he
had
told
his
own
sin
.
His
sin
?
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
The
death
of
Basil
Hallward
seemed
very
little
to
him
.
He
was
thinking
*NL*
of
Hetty
Merton
.
For
it
was
an
unjust
mirror
,
this
mirror
of
his
soul
*NL*
that
he
was
looking
at
.
Vanity
?
Curiosity
?
Hypocrisy
?
Had
there
*NL*
been
nothing
more
in
his
renunciation
than
that
?
There
had
been
*NL*
something
more
.
At
least
he
thought
so
.
But
who
could
tell
?
...
No
.
*NL*
There
had
been
nothing
more
.
Through
vanity
he
had
spared
her
.
In
*NL*
hypocrisy
he
had
worn
the
mask
of
goodness
.
For
curiosity
's
sake
he
*NL*
had
tried
the
denial
of
self
.
He
recognized
that
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
murder
--
was
it
to
dog
him
all
his
life
?
Was
he
always
to
be
*NL*
burdened
by
his
past
?
Was
he
really
to
confess
?
Never
.
There
was
*NL*
only
one
bit
of
evidence
left
against
him
.
The
picture
itself
--
that
*NL*
was
evidence
.
He
would
destroy
it
.
Why
had
he
kept
it
so
long
?
Once
*NL*
it
had
given
him
pleasure
to
watch
it
changing
and
growing
old
.
Of
*NL*
late
he
had
felt
no
such
pleasure
.
It
had
kept
him
awake
at
night
.
*NL*
When
he
had
been
away
,
he
had
been
filled
with
terror
lest
other
eyes
*NL*
should
look
upon
it
.
It
had
brought
melancholy
across
his
passions
.
*NL*
Its
mere
memory
had
marred
many
moments
of
joy
.
It
had
been
like
*NL*
conscience
to
him
.
Yes
,
it
had
been
conscience
.
He
would
destroy
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
and
saw
the
knife
that
had
stabbed
Basil
Hallward
.
He
*NL*
had
cleaned
it
many
times
,
till
there
was
no
stain
left
upon
it
.
It
*NL*
was
bright
,
and
glistened
.
As
it
had
killed
the
painter
,
so
it
would
*NL*
kill
the
painter
's
work
,
and
all
that
that
meant
.
It
would
kill
the
*NL*
past
,
and
when
that
was
dead
,
he
would
be
free
.
It
would
kill
this
*NL*
monstrous
soul-life
,
and
without
its
hideous
warnings
,
he
would
be
at
*NL*
peace
.
He
seized
the
thing
,
and
stabbed
the
picture
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
cry
heard
,
and
a
crash
.
The
cry
was
so
horrible
in
its
*NL*
agony
that
the
frightened
servants
woke
and
crept
out
of
their
rooms
.
*NL*
Two
gentlemen
,
who
were
passing
in
the
square
below
,
stopped
and
looked
*NL*
up
at
the
great
house
.
They
walked
on
till
they
met
a
policeman
and
*NL*
brought
him
back
.
The
man
rang
the
bell
several
times
,
but
there
was
*NL*
no
answer
.
Except
for
a
light
in
one
of
the
top
windows
,
the
house
was
*NL*
all
dark
.
After
a
time
,
he
went
away
and
stood
in
an
adjoining
portico
*NL*
and
watched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
house
is
that
,
Constable
?
''
asked
the
elder
of
the
two
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Dorian
Gray
's
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
policeman
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
each
other
,
as
they
walked
away
,
and
sneered
.
One
of
*NL*
them
was
Sir
Henry
Ashton
's
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Inside
,
in
the
servants
'
part
of
the
house
,
the
half-clad
domestics
*NL*
were
talking
in
low
whispers
to
each
other
.
Old
Mrs.
Leaf
was
crying
*NL*
and
wringing
her
hands
.
Francis
was
as
pale
as
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
he
got
the
coachman
and
one
of
the
*NL*
footmen
and
crept
upstairs
.
They
knocked
,
but
there
was
no
reply
.
*NL*
They
called
out
.
Everything
was
still
.
Finally
,
after
vainly
trying
*NL*
to
force
the
door
,
they
got
on
the
roof
and
dropped
down
on
to
the
*NL*
balcony
.
The
windows
yielded
easily
--
their
bolts
were
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
entered
,
they
found
hanging
upon
the
wall
a
splendid
portrait
*NL*
of
their
master
as
they
had
last
seen
him
,
in
all
the
wonder
of
his
*NL*
exquisite
youth
and
beauty
.
Lying
on
the
floor
was
a
dead
man
,
in
*NL*
evening
dress
,
with
a
knife
in
his
heart
.
He
was
withered
,
wrinkled
,
*NL*
and
loathsome
of
visage
.
It
was
not
till
they
had
examined
the
rings
*NL*
that
they
recognized
who
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
