Left
Munich
at
8:35
P.
M.
,
on
1st
May
,
arriving
at
*NL*
Vienna
early
next
morning
;
should
have
arrived
at
6:46
,
but
train
was
an
*NL*
hour
late
.
Buda-Pesth
seems
a
wonderful
place
,
from
the
glimpse
which
I
*NL*
got
of
it
from
the
train
and
the
little
I
could
walk
through
the
*NL*
streets
.
I
feared
to
go
very
far
from
the
station
,
as
we
had
arrived
*NL*
late
and
would
start
as
near
the
correct
time
as
possible
.
The
*NL*
impression
I
had
was
that
we
were
leaving
the
West
and
entering
the
*NL*
East
;
the
most
western
of
splendid
bridges
over
the
Danube
,
which
is
*NL*
here
of
noble
width
and
depth
,
took
us
among
the
traditions
of
Turkish
*NL*
rule
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
in
pretty
good
time
,
and
came
after
nightfall
to
Klausenburgh
.
*NL*
Here
I
stopped
for
the
night
at
the
Hotel
Royale
.
I
had
for
dinner
,
or
*NL*
rather
supper
,
a
chicken
done
up
some
way
with
red
pepper
,
which
was
*NL*
very
good
but
thirsty
.

-RRB-
I
asked
the
*NL*
waiter
,
and
he
said
it
was
called
``
paprika
hendl
,
''
and
that
,
as
it
was
a
*NL*
national
dish
,
I
should
be
able
to
get
it
anywhere
along
the
*NL*
Carpathians
.
I
found
my
smattering
of
German
very
useful
here
;
indeed
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
I
should
be
able
to
get
on
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
had
some
time
at
my
disposal
when
in
London
,
I
had
visited
the
*NL*
British
Museum
,
and
made
search
among
the
books
and
maps
in
the
library
*NL*
regarding
Transylvania
;
it
had
struck
me
that
some
foreknowledge
of
the
*NL*
country
could
hardly
fail
to
have
some
importance
in
dealing
with
a
*NL*
nobleman
of
that
country
.
I
find
that
the
district
he
named
is
in
the
*NL*
extreme
east
of
the
country
,
just
on
the
borders
of
three
states
,
*NL*
Transylvania
,
Moldavia
and
Bukovina
,
in
the
midst
of
the
Carpathian
*NL*
mountains
;
one
of
the
wildest
and
least
known
portions
of
Europe
.
I
was
*NL*
not
able
to
light
on
any
map
or
work
giving
the
exact
locality
of
the
*NL*
Castle
Dracula
,
as
there
are
no
maps
of
this
country
as
yet
to
compare
*NL*
with
our
own
Ordnance
Survey
maps
;
but
I
found
that
Bistritz
,
the
post
*NL*
town
named
by
Count
Dracula
,
is
a
fairly
well-known
place
.
I
shall
enter
*NL*
here
some
of
my
notes
,
as
they
may
refresh
my
memory
when
I
talk
over
my
*NL*
travels
with
Mina
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
population
of
Transylvania
there
are
four
distinct
nationalities
:
*NL*
Saxons
in
the
South
,
and
mixed
with
them
the
Wallachs
,
who
are
the
*NL*
descendants
of
the
Dacians
;
Magyars
in
the
West
,
and
Szekelys
in
the
*NL*
East
and
North
.
I
am
going
among
the
latter
,
who
claim
to
be
descended
*NL*
from
Attila
and
the
Huns
.
This
may
be
so
,
for
when
the
Magyars
conquered
*NL*
the
country
in
the
eleventh
century
they
found
the
Huns
settled
in
it
.
I
*NL*
read
that
every
known
superstition
in
the
world
is
gathered
into
the
*NL*
horseshoe
of
the
Carpathians
,
as
if
it
were
the
centre
of
some
sort
of
*NL*
imaginative
whirlpool
;
if
so
my
stay
may
be
very
interesting
.
-LRB-
_
Mem
.
_
,
I
*NL*
must
ask
the
Count
all
about
them
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
sleep
well
,
though
my
bed
was
comfortable
enough
,
for
I
had
*NL*
all
sorts
of
queer
dreams
.
There
was
a
dog
howling
all
night
under
my
*NL*
window
,
which
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
;
or
it
may
have
been
*NL*
the
paprika
,
for
I
had
to
drink
up
all
the
water
in
my
carafe
,
and
was
*NL*
still
thirsty
.
Towards
morning
I
slept
and
was
wakened
by
the
continuous
*NL*
knocking
at
my
door
,
so
I
guess
I
must
have
been
sleeping
soundly
then
.
*NL*
I
had
for
breakfast
more
paprika
,
and
a
sort
of
porridge
of
maize
flour
*NL*
which
they
said
was
``
mamaliga
,
''
and
egg-plant
stuffed
with
forcemeat
,
a
*NL*
very
excellent
dish
,
which
they
call
``
impletata
.
''
-LRB-
_
Mem
.
_
,
get
recipe
*NL*
for
this
also
.
-RRB-
I
had
to
hurry
breakfast
,
for
the
train
started
a
little
*NL*
before
eight
,
or
rather
it
ought
to
have
done
so
,
for
after
rushing
to
*NL*
the
station
at
7:30
I
had
to
sit
in
the
carriage
for
more
than
an
hour
*NL*
before
we
began
to
move
.
It
seems
to
me
that
the
further
east
you
go
the
*NL*
more
unpunctual
are
the
trains
.
What
ought
they
to
be
in
China
?
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
long
we
seemed
to
dawdle
through
a
country
which
was
full
of
*NL*
beauty
of
every
kind
.
Sometimes
we
saw
little
towns
or
castles
on
the
*NL*
top
of
steep
hills
such
as
we
see
in
old
missals
;
sometimes
we
ran
by
*NL*
rivers
and
streams
which
seemed
from
the
wide
stony
margin
on
each
side
*NL*
of
them
to
be
subject
to
great
floods
.
It
takes
a
lot
of
water
,
and
*NL*
running
strong
,
to
sweep
the
outside
edge
of
a
river
clear
.
At
every
*NL*
station
there
were
groups
of
people
,
sometimes
crowds
,
and
in
all
sorts
*NL*
of
attire
.
Some
of
them
were
just
like
the
peasants
at
home
or
those
I
*NL*
saw
coming
through
France
and
Germany
,
with
short
jackets
and
round
hats
*NL*
and
home-made
trousers
;
but
others
were
very
picturesque
.
The
women
*NL*
looked
pretty
,
except
when
you
got
near
them
,
but
they
were
very
clumsy
*NL*
about
the
waist
.
They
had
all
full
white
sleeves
of
some
kind
or
other
,
*NL*
and
most
of
them
had
big
belts
with
a
lot
of
strips
of
something
*NL*
fluttering
from
them
like
the
dresses
in
a
ballet
,
but
of
course
there
*NL*
were
petticoats
under
them
.
The
strangest
figures
we
saw
were
the
*NL*
Slovaks
,
who
were
more
barbarian
than
the
rest
,
with
their
big
cow-boy
*NL*
hats
,
great
baggy
dirty-white
trousers
,
white
linen
shirts
,
and
enormous
*NL*
heavy
leather
belts
,
nearly
a
foot
wide
,
all
studded
over
with
brass
*NL*
nails
.
They
wore
high
boots
,
with
their
trousers
tucked
into
them
,
and
*NL*
had
long
black
hair
and
heavy
black
moustaches
.
They
are
very
*NL*
picturesque
,
but
do
not
look
prepossessing
.
On
the
stage
they
would
be
*NL*
set
down
at
once
as
some
old
Oriental
band
of
brigands
.
They
are
,
*NL*
however
,
I
am
told
,
very
harmless
and
rather
wanting
in
natural
*NL*
self-assertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
dark
side
of
twilight
when
we
got
to
Bistritz
,
which
is
a
*NL*
very
interesting
old
place
.
Being
practically
on
the
frontier
--
for
the
*NL*
Borgo
Pass
leads
from
it
into
Bukovina
--
it
has
had
a
very
stormy
*NL*
existence
,
and
it
certainly
shows
marks
of
it
.
Fifty
years
ago
a
series
*NL*
of
great
fires
took
place
,
which
made
terrible
havoc
on
five
separate
*NL*
occasions
.
At
the
very
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
underwent
*NL*
a
siege
of
three
weeks
and
lost
13,000
people
,
the
casualties
of
war
*NL*
proper
being
assisted
by
famine
and
disease
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Dracula
had
directed
me
to
go
to
the
Golden
Krone
Hotel
,
which
I
*NL*
found
,
to
my
great
delight
,
to
be
thoroughly
old-fashioned
,
for
of
*NL*
course
I
wanted
to
see
all
I
could
of
the
ways
of
the
country
.
I
was
*NL*
evidently
expected
,
for
when
I
got
near
the
door
I
faced
a
*NL*
cheery-looking
elderly
woman
in
the
usual
peasant
dress
--
white
*NL*
undergarment
with
long
double
apron
,
front
,
and
back
,
of
coloured
stuff
*NL*
fitting
almost
too
tight
for
modesty
.
When
I
came
close
she
bowed
and
*NL*
said
,
``
The
Herr
Englishman
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
,
``
Jonathan
Harker
.
''
She
*NL*
smiled
,
and
gave
some
message
to
an
elderly
man
in
white
shirt-sleeves
,
*NL*
who
had
followed
her
to
the
door
.
He
went
,
but
immediately
returned
with
*NL*
a
letter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Friend
.
--
Welcome
to
the
Carpathians
.
I
am
anxiously
expecting
*NL*
you
.
Sleep
well
to-night
.
At
three
to-morrow
the
diligence
will
*NL*
start
for
Bukovina
;
a
place
on
it
is
kept
for
you
.
At
the
Borgo
*NL*
Pass
my
carriage
will
await
you
and
will
bring
you
to
me
.
I
trust
*NL*
that
your
journey
from
London
has
been
a
happy
one
,
and
that
you
*NL*
will
enjoy
your
stay

May

--
I
found
that
my
landlord
had
got
a
letter
from
the
Count
,
*NL*
directing
him
to
secure
the
best
place
on
the
coach
for
me
;
but
on
*NL*
making
inquiries
as
to
details
he
seemed
somewhat
reticent
,
and
*NL*
pretended
that
he
could
not
understand
my
German
.
This
could
not
be
*NL*
true
,
because
up
to
then
he
had
understood
it
perfectly
;
at
least
,
he
*NL*
answered
my
questions
exactly
as
if
he
did
.
He
and
his
wife
,
the
old
*NL*
lady
who
had
received
me
,
looked
at
each
other
in
a
frightened
sort
of
*NL*
way
.
He
mumbled
out
that
the
money
had
been
sent
in
a
letter
,
and
that
*NL*
was
all
he
knew
.
When
I
asked
him
if
he
knew
Count
Dracula
,
and
could
*NL*
tell
me
anything
of
his
castle
,
both
he
and
his
wife
crossed
themselves
,
*NL*
and
,
saying
that
they
knew
nothing
at
all
,
simply
refused
to
speak
*NL*
further
.
It
was
so
near
the
time
of
starting
that
I
had
no
time
to
ask
*NL*
any
one
else
,
for
it
was
all
very
mysterious
and
not
by
any
means
*NL*
comforting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
before
I
was
leaving
,
the
old
lady
came
up
to
my
room
and
said
in
a
*NL*
very
hysterical
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
you
go
?
Oh
!
young
Herr
,
must
you
go
?
''
She
was
in
such
an
excited
*NL*
state
that
she
seemed
to
have
lost
her
grip
of
what
German
she
knew
,
and
*NL*
mixed
it
all
up
with
some
other
language
which
I
did
not
know
at
all
.
I
*NL*
was
just
able
to
follow
her
by
asking
many
questions
.
When
I
told
her
*NL*
that
I
must
go
at
once
,
and
that
I
was
engaged
on
important
business
,
*NL*
she
asked
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
day
it
is
?
''
I
answered
that
it
was
the
fourth
of
May
.
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
as
she
said
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
I
know
that
!
I
know
that
,
but
do
you
know
what
day
it
is
?
''
On
*NL*
my
saying
that
I
did
not
understand
,
she
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
eve
of
St.
George
's
Day
.
Do
you
not
know
that
to-night
,
when
*NL*
the
clock
strikes
midnight
,
all
the
evil
things
in
the
world
will
have
*NL*
full
sway
?
Do
you
know
where
you
are
going
,
and
what
you
are
going
to
?
''
*NL*
She
was
in
such
evident
distress
that
I
tried
to
comfort
her
,
but
*NL*
without
effect
.
Finally
she
went
down
on
her
knees
and
implored
me
not
*NL*
to
go
;
at
least
to
wait
a
day
or
two
before
starting
.
It
was
all
very
*NL*
ridiculous
but
I
did
not
feel
comfortable
.
However
,
there
was
business
*NL*
to
be
done
,
and
I
could
allow
nothing
to
interfere
with
it
.
I
therefore
*NL*
tried
to
raise
her
up
,
and
said
,
as
gravely
as
I
could
,
that
I
thanked
*NL*
her
,
but
my
duty
was
imperative
,
and
that
I
must
go
.
She
then
rose
and
*NL*
dried
her
eyes
,
and
taking
a
crucifix
from
her
neck
offered
it
to
me
.
I
*NL*
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
for
,
as
an
English
Churchman
,
I
have
been
*NL*
taught
to
regard
such
things
as
in
some
measure
idolatrous
,
and
yet
it
*NL*
seemed
so
ungracious
to
refuse
an
old
lady
meaning
so
well
and
in
such
a
*NL*
state
of
mind
.
She
saw
,
I
suppose
,
the
doubt
in
my
face
,
for
she
put
the
*NL*
rosary
round
my
neck
,
and
said
,
``
For
your
mother
's
sake
,
''
and
went
out
*NL*
of
the
room
.
I
am
writing
up
this
part
of
the
diary
whilst
I
am
waiting
*NL*
for
the
coach
,
which
is
,
of
course
,
late
;
and
the
crucifix
is
still
*NL*
round
my
neck
.
Whether
it
is
the
old
lady
's
fear
,
or
the
many
ghostly
*NL*
traditions
of
this
place
,
or
the
crucifix
itself
,
I
do
not
know
,
but
I
*NL*
am
not
feeling
nearly
as
easy
in
my
mind
as
usual
.
If
this
book
should
*NL*
ever
reach
Mina
before
I
do
,
let
it
bring
my
good-bye
.
Here
comes
the
*NL*
coach
!

_
5
May
.
The
Castle
.
_
--
The
grey
of
the
morning
has
passed
,
and
the
sun
is
*NL*
high
over
the
distant
horizon
,
which
seems
jagged
,
whether
with
trees
or
*NL*
hills
I
know
not
,
for
it
is
so
far
off
that
big
things
and
little
are
*NL*
mixed
.
I
am
not
sleepy
,
and
,
as
I
am
not
to
be
called
till
I
awake
,
*NL*
naturally
I
write
till
sleep
comes
.
There
are
many
odd
things
to
put
*NL*
down
,
and
,
lest
who
reads
them
may
fancy
that
I
dined
too
well
before
I
*NL*
left
Bistritz
,
let
me
put
down
my
dinner
exactly
.
I
dined
on
what
they
*NL*
called
``
robber
steak
''
--
bits
of
bacon
,
onion
,
and
beef
,
seasoned
with
red
*NL*
pepper
,
and
strung
on
sticks
and
roasted
over
the
fire
,
in
the
simple
*NL*
style
of
the
London
cat
's
meat
!
The
wine
was
Golden
Mediasch
,
which
*NL*
produces
a
queer
sting
on
the
tongue
,
which
is
,
however
,
not
*NL*
disagreeable
.
I
had
only
a
couple
of
glasses
of
this
,
and
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
on
the
coach
the
driver
had
not
taken
his
seat
,
and
I
saw
him
*NL*
talking
with
the
landlady
.
They
were
evidently
talking
of
me
,
for
every
*NL*
now
and
then
they
looked
at
me
,
and
some
of
the
people
who
were
sitting
*NL*
on
the
bench
outside
the
door
--
which
they
call
by
a
name
meaning
*NL*
``
word-bearer
''
--
came
and
listened
,
and
then
looked
at
me
,
most
of
them
*NL*
pityingly
.
I
could
hear
a
lot
of
words
often
repeated
,
queer
words
,
for
*NL*
there
were
many
nationalities
in
the
crowd
;
so
I
quietly
got
my
polyglot
*NL*
dictionary
from
my
bag
and
looked
them
out
.
I
must
say
they
were
not
*NL*
cheering
to
me
,
for
amongst
them
were
``
Ordog
''
--
Satan
,
``
pokol
''
--
hell
,
*NL*
``
stregoica
''
--
witch
,
``
vrolok
''
and
``
vlkoslak
''
--
both
of
which
mean
the
same
*NL*
thing
,
one
being
Slovak
and
the
other
Servian
for
something
that
is
*NL*
either
were-wolf
or
vampire
.
-LRB-
_
Mem
.
_
,
I
must
ask
the
Count
about
these
*NL*
superstitions
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
started
,
the
crowd
round
the
inn
door
,
which
had
by
this
time
*NL*
swelled
to
a
considerable
size
,
all
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
*NL*
pointed
two
fingers
towards
me
.
With
some
difficulty
I
got
a
*NL*
fellow-passenger
to
tell
me
what
they
meant
;
he
would
not
answer
at
*NL*
first
,
but
on
learning
that
I
was
English
,
he
explained
that
it
was
a
*NL*
charm
or
guard
against
the
evil
eye
.
This
was
not
very
pleasant
for
me
,
*NL*
just
starting
for
an
unknown
place
to
meet
an
unknown
man
;
but
every
one
*NL*
seemed
so
kind-hearted
,
and
so
sorrowful
,
and
so
sympathetic
that
I
*NL*
could
not
but
be
touched
.
I
shall
never
forget
the
last
glimpse
which
I
*NL*
had
of
the
inn-yard
and
its
crowd
of
picturesque
figures
,
all
crossing
*NL*
themselves
,
as
they
stood
round
the
wide
archway
,
with
its
background
of
*NL*
rich
foliage
of
oleander
and
orange
trees
in
green
tubs
clustered
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
yard
.
Then
our
driver
,
whose
wide
linen
drawers
covered
*NL*
the
whole
front
of
the
box-seat
--
``
gotza
''
they
call
them
--
cracked
his
big
*NL*
whip
over
his
four
small
horses
,
which
ran
abreast
,
and
we
set
off
on
*NL*
our
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
lost
sight
and
recollection
of
ghostly
fears
in
the
beauty
of
the
*NL*
scene
as
we
drove
along
,
although
had
I
known
the
language
,
or
rather
*NL*
languages
,
which
my
fellow-passengers
were
speaking
,
I
might
not
have
*NL*
been
able
to
throw
them
off
so
easily
.
Before
us
lay
a
green
sloping
*NL*
land
full
of
forests
and
woods
,
with
here
and
there
steep
hills
,
crowned
*NL*
with
clumps
of
trees
or
with
farmhouses
,
the
blank
gable
end
to
the
*NL*
road
.
There
was
everywhere
a
bewildering
mass
of
fruit
blossom
--
apple
,
*NL*
plum
,
pear
,
cherry
;
and
as
we
drove
by
I
could
see
the
green
grass
under
*NL*
the
trees
spangled
with
the
fallen
petals
.
In
and
out
amongst
these
*NL*
green
hills
of
what
they
call
here
the
``
Mittel
Land
''
ran
the
road
,
*NL*
losing
itself
as
it
swept
round
the
grassy
curve
,
or
was
shut
out
by
the
*NL*
straggling
ends
of
pine
woods
,
which
here
and
there
ran
down
the
*NL*
hillsides
like
tongues
of
flame
.
The
road
was
rugged
,
but
still
we
*NL*
seemed
to
fly
over
it
with
a
feverish
haste
.
I
could
not
understand
then
*NL*
what
the
haste
meant
,
but
the
driver
was
evidently
bent
on
losing
no
*NL*
time
in
reaching
Borgo
Prund
.
I
was
told
that
this
road
is
in
summertime
*NL*
excellent
,
but
that
it
had
not
yet
been
put
in
order
after
the
winter
*NL*
snows
.
In
this
respect
it
is
different
from
the
general
run
of
roads
in
*NL*
the
Carpathians
,
for
it
is
an
old
tradition
that
they
are
not
to
be
kept
*NL*
in
too
good
order
.
Of
old
the
Hospadars
would
not
repair
them
,
lest
the
*NL*
Turk
should
think
that
they
were
preparing
to
bring
in
foreign
troops
,
*NL*
and
so
hasten
the
war
which
was
always
really
at
loading
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
green
swelling
hills
of
the
Mittel
Land
rose
mighty
slopes
*NL*
of
forest
up
to
the
lofty
steeps
of
the
Carpathians
themselves
.
Right
*NL*
and
left
of
us
they
towered
,
with
the
afternoon
sun
falling
full
upon
*NL*
them
and
bringing
out
all
the
glorious
colours
of
this
beautiful
range
,
*NL*
deep
blue
and
purple
in
the
shadows
of
the
peaks
,
green
and
brown
where
*NL*
grass
and
rock
mingled
,
and
an
endless
perspective
of
jagged
rock
and
*NL*
pointed
crags
,
till
these
were
themselves
lost
in
the
distance
,
where
*NL*
the
snowy
peaks
rose
grandly
.
Here
and
there
seemed
mighty
rifts
in
the
*NL*
mountains
,
through
which
,
as
the
sun
began
to
sink
,
we
saw
now
and
again
*NL*
the
white
gleam
of
falling
water
.
One
of
my
companions
touched
my
arm
as
*NL*
we
swept
round
the
base
of
a
hill
and
opened
up
the
lofty
,
snow-covered
*NL*
peak
of
a
mountain
,
which
seemed
,
as
we
wound
on
our
serpentine
way
,
to
*NL*
be
right
before
us
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
Isten
szek
!
''
--
``
God
's
seat
!
''
--
and
he
crossed
himself
reverently
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
wound
on
our
endless
way
,
and
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
behind
*NL*
us
,
the
shadows
of
the
evening
began
to
creep
round
us
.
This
was
*NL*
emphasised
by
the
fact
that
the
snowy
mountain-top
still
held
the
*NL*
sunset
,
and
seemed
to
glow
out
with
a
delicate
cool
pink
.
Here
and
there
*NL*
we
passed
Cszeks
and
Slovaks
,
all
in
picturesque
attire
,
but
I
noticed
*NL*
that
goitre
was
painfully
prevalent
.
By
the
roadside
were
many
crosses
,
*NL*
and
as
we
swept
by
,
my
companions
all
crossed
themselves
.
Here
and
there
*NL*
was
a
peasant
man
or
woman
kneeling
before
a
shrine
,
who
did
not
even
*NL*
turn
round
as
we
approached
,
but
seemed
in
the
self-surrender
of
*NL*
devotion
to
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
the
outer
world
.
There
were
*NL*
many
things
new
to
me
:
for
instance
,
hay-ricks
in
the
trees
,
and
here
*NL*
and
there
very
beautiful
masses
of
weeping
birch
,
their
white
stems
*NL*
shining
like
silver
through
the
delicate
green
of
the
leaves
.
Now
and
*NL*
again
we
passed
a
leiter-wagon
--
the
ordinary
peasant
's
cart
--
with
its
*NL*
long
,
snake-like
vertebra
,
calculated
to
suit
the
inequalities
of
the
*NL*
road
.
On
this
were
sure
to
be
seated
quite
a
group
of
home-coming
*NL*
peasants
,
the
Cszeks
with
their
white
,
and
the
Slovaks
with
their
*NL*
coloured
,
sheepskins
,
the
latter
carrying
lance-fashion
their
long
*NL*
staves
,
with
axe
at
end
.
As
the
evening
fell
it
began
to
get
very
cold
,
*NL*
and
the
growing
twilight
seemed
to
merge
into
one
dark
mistiness
the
*NL*
gloom
of
the
trees
,
oak
,
beech
,
and
pine
,
though
in
the
valleys
which
*NL*
ran
deep
between
the
spurs
of
the
hills
,
as
we
ascended
through
the
*NL*
Pass
,
the
dark
firs
stood
out
here
and
there
against
the
background
of
*NL*
late-lying
snow
.
Sometimes
,
as
the
road
was
cut
through
the
pine
woods
*NL*
that
seemed
in
the
darkness
to
be
closing
down
upon
us
,
great
masses
of
*NL*
greyness
,
which
here
and
there
bestrewed
the
trees
,
produced
a
*NL*
peculiarly
weird
and
solemn
effect
,
which
carried
on
the
thoughts
and
*NL*
grim
fancies
engendered
earlier
in
the
evening
,
when
the
falling
sunset
*NL*
threw
into
strange
relief
the
ghost-like
clouds
which
amongst
the
*NL*
Carpathians
seem
to
wind
ceaselessly
through
the
valleys
.
Sometimes
the
*NL*
hills
were
so
steep
that
,
despite
our
driver
's
haste
,
the
horses
could
*NL*
only
go
slowly
.
I
wished
to
get
down
and
walk
up
them
,
as
we
do
at
home
,
*NL*
but
the
driver
would
not
hear
of
it
.
``
No
,
no
,
''
he
said
;
``
you
must
not
*NL*
walk
here
;
the
dogs
are
too
fierce
''
;
and
then
he
added
,
with
what
he
*NL*
evidently
meant
for
grim
pleasantry
--
for
he
looked
round
to
catch
the
*NL*
approving
smile
of
the
rest
--
``
and
you
may
have
enough
of
such
matters
*NL*
before
you
go
to
sleep
.
''
The
only
stop
he
would
make
was
a
moment
's
*NL*
pause
to
light
his
lamps
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
grew
dark
there
seemed
to
be
some
excitement
amongst
the
*NL*
passengers
,
and
they
kept
speaking
to
him
,
one
after
the
other
,
as
*NL*
though
urging
him
to
further
speed
.
He
lashed
the
horses
unmercifully
*NL*
with
his
long
whip
,
and
with
wild
cries
of
encouragement
urged
them
on
*NL*
to
further
exertions
.
Then
through
the
darkness
I
could
see
a
sort
of
*NL*
patch
of
grey
light
ahead
of
us
,
as
though
there
were
a
cleft
in
the
*NL*
hills
.
The
excitement
of
the
passengers
grew
greater
;
the
crazy
coach
*NL*
rocked
on
its
great
leather
springs
,
and
swayed
like
a
boat
tossed
on
a
*NL*
stormy
sea
.
I
had
to
hold
on
.
The
road
grew
more
level
,
and
we
appeared
*NL*
to
fly
along
.
Then
the
mountains
seemed
to
come
nearer
to
us
on
each
*NL*
side
and
to
frown
down
upon
us
;
we
were
entering
on
the
Borgo
Pass
.
One
*NL*
by
one
several
of
the
passengers
offered
me
gifts
,
which
they
pressed
*NL*
upon
me
with
an
earnestness
which
would
take
no
denial
;
these
were
*NL*
certainly
of
an
odd
and
varied
kind
,
but
each
was
given
in
simple
good
*NL*
faith
,
with
a
kindly
word
,
and
a
blessing
,
and
that
strange
mixture
of
*NL*
fear-meaning
movements
which
I
had
seen
outside
the
hotel
at
*NL*
Bistritz
--
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
the
guard
against
the
evil
eye
.
*NL*
Then
,
as
we
flew
along
,
the
driver
leaned
forward
,
and
on
each
side
the
*NL*
passengers
,
craning
over
the
edge
of
the
coach
,
peered
eagerly
into
the
*NL*
darkness
.
It
was
evident
that
something
very
exciting
was
either
*NL*
happening
or
expected
,
but
though
I
asked
each
passenger
,
no
one
would
*NL*
give
me
the
slightest
explanation
.
This
state
of
excitement
kept
on
for
*NL*
some
little
time
;
and
at
last
we
saw
before
us
the
Pass
opening
out
on
*NL*
the
eastern
side
.
There
were
dark
,
rolling
clouds
overhead
,
and
in
the
*NL*
air
the
heavy
,
oppressive
sense
of
thunder
.
It
seemed
as
though
the
*NL*
mountain
range
had
separated
two
atmospheres
,
and
that
now
we
had
got
*NL*
into
the
thunderous
one
.
I
was
now
myself
looking
out
for
the
conveyance
*NL*
which
was
to
take
me
to
the
Count
.
Each
moment
I
expected
to
see
the
*NL*
glare
of
lamps
through
the
blackness
;
but
all
was
dark
.
The
only
light
*NL*
was
the
flickering
rays
of
our
own
lamps
,
in
which
the
steam
from
our
*NL*
hard-driven
horses
rose
in
a
white
cloud
.
We
could
see
now
the
sandy
*NL*
road
lying
white
before
us
,
but
there
was
on
it
no
sign
of
a
vehicle
.
*NL*
The
passengers
drew
back
with
a
sigh
of
gladness
,
which
seemed
to
mock
*NL*
my
own
disappointment
.
I
was
already
thinking
what
I
had
best
do
,
when
*NL*
the
driver
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
said
to
the
others
something
which
I
*NL*
could
hardly
hear
,
it
was
spoken
so
quietly
and
in
so
low
a
tone
;
I
*NL*
thought
it
was
``
An
hour
less
than
the
time
.
''
Then
turning
to
me
,
he
said
*NL*
in
German
worse
than
my
own
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
carriage
here
.
The
Herr
is
not
expected
after
all
.
He
will
*NL*
now
come
on
to
Bukovina
,
and
return
to-morrow
or
the
next
day
;
better
*NL*
the
next
day
.
''
Whilst
he
was
speaking
the
horses
began
to
neigh
and
*NL*
snort
and
plunge
wildly
,
so
that
the
driver
had
to
hold
them
up
.
Then
,
*NL*
amongst
a
chorus
of
screams
from
the
peasants
and
a
universal
crossing
*NL*
of
themselves
,
a
caleche
,
with
four
horses
,
drove
up
behind
us
,
overtook
*NL*
us
,
and
drew
up
beside
the
coach
.
I
could
see
from
the
flash
of
our
*NL*
lamps
,
as
the
rays
fell
on
them
,
that
the
horses
were
coal-black
and
*NL*
splendid
animals
.
They
were
driven
by
a
tall
man
,
with
a
long
brown
*NL*
beard
and
a
great
black
hat
,
which
seemed
to
hide
his
face
from
us
.
I
*NL*
could
only
see
the
gleam
of
a
pair
of
very
bright
eyes
,
which
seemed
red
*NL*
in
the
lamplight
,
as
he
turned
to
us
.
He
said
to
the
driver
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
early
to-night
,
my
friend
.
''
The
man
stammered
in
reply
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
English
Herr
was
in
a
hurry
,
''
to
which
the
stranger
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
why
,
I
suppose
,
you
wished
him
to
go
on
to
Bukovina
.
You
can
not
*NL*
deceive
me
,
my
friend
;
I
know
too
much
,
and
my
horses
are
swift
.
''
As
he
*NL*
spoke
he
smiled
,
and
the
lamplight
fell
on
a
hard-looking
mouth
,
with
*NL*
very
red
lips
and
sharp-looking
teeth
,
as
white
as
ivory
.
One
of
my
*NL*
companions
whispered
to
another
the
line
from
Burger
's
``
Lenore
''
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Denn
die
Todten
reiten
schnell
''
--
*NL*
-LRB-
``
For
the
dead
travel
fast
.
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
strange
driver
evidently
heard
the
words
,
for
he
looked
up
with
a
*NL*
gleaming
smile
.
The
passenger
turned
his
face
away
,
at
the
same
time
*NL*
putting
out
his
two
fingers
and
crossing
himself
.
``
Give
me
the
Herr
's
*NL*
luggage
,
''
said
the
driver
;
and
with
exceeding
alacrity
my
bags
were
*NL*
handed
out
and
put
in
the
caleche
.
Then
I
descended
from
the
side
of
the
*NL*
coach
,
as
the
caleche
was
close
alongside
,
the
driver
helping
me
with
a
*NL*
hand
which
caught
my
arm
in
a
grip
of
steel
;
his
strength
must
have
been
*NL*
prodigious
.
Without
a
word
he
shook
his
reins
,
the
horses
turned
,
and
we
*NL*
swept
into
the
darkness
of
the
Pass
.
As
I
looked
back
I
saw
the
steam
*NL*
from
the
horses
of
the
coach
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
,
and
projected
*NL*
against
it
the
figures
of
my
late
companions
crossing
themselves
.
Then
*NL*
the
driver
cracked
his
whip
and
called
to
his
horses
,
and
off
they
swept
*NL*
on
their
way
to
Bukovina
.
As
they
sank
into
the
darkness
I
felt
a
*NL*
strange
chill
,
and
a
lonely
feeling
came
over
me
;
but
a
cloak
was
thrown
*NL*
over
my
shoulders
,
and
a
rug
across
my
knees
,
and
the
driver
said
in
*NL*
excellent
German
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
night
is
chill
,
mein
Herr
,
and
my
master
the
Count
bade
me
take
all
*NL*
care
of
you
.
There
is
a
flask
of
slivovitz
-LRB-
the
plum
brandy
of
the
*NL*
country
-RRB-
underneath
the
seat
,
if
you
should
require
it
.
''
I
did
not
take
*NL*
any
,
but
it
was
a
comfort
to
know
it
was
there
all
the
same
.
I
felt
a
*NL*
little
strangely
,
and
not
a
little
frightened
.
I
think
had
there
been
*NL*
any
alternative
I
should
have
taken
it
,
instead
of
prosecuting
that
*NL*
unknown
night
journey
.
The
carriage
went
at
a
hard
pace
straight
along
,
*NL*
then
we
made
a
complete
turn
and
went
along
another
straight
road
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
simply
going
over
and
over
the
same
ground
*NL*
again
;
and
so
I
took
note
of
some
salient
point
,
and
found
that
this
was
*NL*
so
.
I
would
have
liked
to
have
asked
the
driver
what
this
all
meant
,
but
*NL*
I
really
feared
to
do
so
,
for
I
thought
that
,
placed
as
I
was
,
any
*NL*
protest
would
have
had
no
effect
in
case
there
had
been
an
intention
to
*NL*
delay
.
By-and-by
,
however
,
as
I
was
curious
to
know
how
time
was
*NL*
passing
,
I
struck
a
match
,
and
by
its
flame
looked
at
my
watch
;
it
was
*NL*
within
a
few
minutes
of
midnight
.
This
gave
me
a
sort
of
shock
,
for
I
*NL*
suppose
the
general
superstition
about
midnight
was
increased
by
my
*NL*
recent
experiences
.
I
waited
with
a
sick
feeling
of
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
dog
began
to
howl
somewhere
in
a
farmhouse
far
down
the
road
--
a
*NL*
long
,
agonised
wailing
,
as
if
from
fear
.
The
sound
was
taken
up
by
*NL*
another
dog
,
and
then
another
and
another
,
till
,
borne
on
the
wind
which
*NL*
now
sighed
softly
through
the
Pass
,
a
wild
howling
began
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
come
from
all
over
the
country
,
as
far
as
the
imagination
could
grasp
*NL*
it
through
the
gloom
of
the
night
.
At
the
first
howl
the
horses
began
to
*NL*
strain
and
rear
,
but
the
driver
spoke
to
them
soothingly
,
and
they
*NL*
quieted
down
,
but
shivered
and
sweated
as
though
after
a
runaway
from
*NL*
sudden
fright
.
Then
,
far
off
in
the
distance
,
from
the
mountains
on
each
*NL*
side
of
us
began
a
louder
and
a
sharper
howling
--
that
of
wolves
--
which
*NL*
affected
both
the
horses
and
myself
in
the
same
way
--
for
I
was
minded
to
*NL*
jump
from
the
caleche
and
run
,
whilst
they
reared
again
and
plunged
*NL*
madly
,
so
that
the
driver
had
to
use
all
his
great
strength
to
keep
them
*NL*
from
bolting
.
In
a
few
minutes
,
however
,
my
own
ears
got
accustomed
to
*NL*
the
sound
,
and
the
horses
so
far
became
quiet
that
the
driver
was
able
*NL*
to
descend
and
to
stand
before
them
.
He
petted
and
soothed
them
,
and
*NL*
whispered
something
in
their
ears
,
as
I
have
heard
of
horse-tamers
*NL*
doing
,
and
with
extraordinary
effect
,
for
under
his
caresses
they
became
*NL*
quite
manageable
again
,
though
they
still
trembled
.
The
driver
again
*NL*
took
his
seat
,
and
shaking
his
reins
,
started
off
at
a
great
pace
.
This
*NL*
time
,
after
going
to
the
far
side
of
the
Pass
,
he
suddenly
turned
down
a
*NL*
narrow
roadway
which
ran
sharply
to
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
we
were
hemmed
in
with
trees
,
which
in
places
arched
right
over
the
*NL*
roadway
till
we
passed
as
through
a
tunnel
;
and
again
great
frowning
*NL*
rocks
guarded
us
boldly
on
either
side
.
Though
we
were
in
shelter
,
we
*NL*
could
hear
the
rising
wind
,
for
it
moaned
and
whistled
through
the
*NL*
rocks
,
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
crashed
together
as
we
swept
along
.
*NL*
It
grew
colder
and
colder
still
,
and
fine
,
powdery
snow
began
to
fall
,
*NL*
so
that
soon
we
and
all
around
us
were
covered
with
a
white
blanket
.
The
*NL*
keen
wind
still
carried
the
howling
of
the
dogs
,
though
this
grew
*NL*
fainter
as
we
went
on
our
way
.
The
baying
of
the
wolves
sounded
nearer
*NL*
and
nearer
,
as
though
they
were
closing
round
on
us
from
every
side
.
I
*NL*
grew
dreadfully
afraid
,
and
the
horses
shared
my
fear
.
The
driver
,
*NL*
however
,
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
;
he
kept
turning
his
head
to
*NL*
left
and
right
,
but
I
could
not
see
anything
through
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
away
on
our
left
,
I
saw
a
faint
flickering
blue
flame
.
The
*NL*
driver
saw
it
at
the
same
moment
;
he
at
once
checked
the
horses
,
and
,
*NL*
jumping
to
the
ground
,
disappeared
into
the
darkness
.
I
did
not
know
*NL*
what
to
do
,
the
less
as
the
howling
of
the
wolves
grew
closer
;
but
while
*NL*
I
wondered
the
driver
suddenly
appeared
again
,
and
without
a
word
took
*NL*
his
seat
,
and
we
resumed
our
journey
.
I
think
I
must
have
fallen
asleep
*NL*
and
kept
dreaming
of
the
incident
,
for
it
seemed
to
be
repeated
*NL*
endlessly
,
and
now
looking
back
,
it
is
like
a
sort
of
awful
nightmare
.
*NL*
Once
the
flame
appeared
so
near
the
road
,
that
even
in
the
darkness
*NL*
around
us
I
could
watch
the
driver
's
motions
.
He
went
rapidly
to
where
*NL*
the
blue
flame
arose
--
it
must
have
been
very
faint
,
for
it
did
not
seem
*NL*
to
illumine
the
place
around
it
at
all
--
and
gathering
a
few
stones
,
*NL*
formed
them
into
some
device
.
Once
there
appeared
a
strange
optical
*NL*
effect
:
when
he
stood
between
me
and
the
flame
he
did
not
obstruct
it
,
*NL*
for
I
could
see
its
ghostly
flicker
all
the
same
.
This
startled
me
,
but
*NL*
as
the
effect
was
only
momentary
,
I
took
it
that
my
eyes
deceived
me
*NL*
straining
through
the
darkness
.
Then
for
a
time
there
were
no
blue
*NL*
flames
,
and
we
sped
onwards
through
the
gloom
,
with
the
howling
of
the
*NL*
wolves
around
us
,
as
though
they
were
following
in
a
moving
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
there
came
a
time
when
the
driver
went
further
afield
than
he
*NL*
had
yet
gone
,
and
during
his
absence
,
the
horses
began
to
tremble
worse
*NL*
than
ever
and
to
snort
and
scream
with
fright
.
I
could
not
see
any
cause
*NL*
for
it
,
for
the
howling
of
the
wolves
had
ceased
altogether
;
but
just
*NL*
then
the
moon
,
sailing
through
the
black
clouds
,
appeared
behind
the
*NL*
jagged
crest
of
a
beetling
,
pine-clad
rock
,
and
by
its
light
I
saw
*NL*
around
us
a
ring
of
wolves
,
with
white
teeth
and
lolling
red
tongues
,
*NL*
with
long
,
sinewy
limbs
and
shaggy
hair
.
They
were
a
hundred
times
more
*NL*
terrible
in
the
grim
silence
which
held
them
than
even
when
they
howled
.
*NL*
For
myself
,
I
felt
a
sort
of
paralysis
of
fear
.
It
is
only
when
a
man
*NL*
feels
himself
face
to
face
with
such
horrors
that
he
can
understand
*NL*
their
true
import
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
the
wolves
began
to
howl
as
though
the
moonlight
had
had
*NL*
some
peculiar
effect
on
them
.
The
horses
jumped
about
and
reared
,
and
*NL*
looked
helplessly
round
with
eyes
that
rolled
in
a
way
painful
to
see
;
*NL*
but
the
living
ring
of
terror
encompassed
them
on
every
side
;
and
they
*NL*
had
perforce
to
remain
within
it
.
I
called
to
the
coachman
to
come
,
for
*NL*
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
only
chance
was
to
try
to
break
out
through
the
*NL*
ring
and
to
aid
his
approach
.
I
shouted
and
beat
the
side
of
the
*NL*
caleche
,
hoping
by
the
noise
to
scare
the
wolves
from
that
side
,
so
as
*NL*
to
give
him
a
chance
of
reaching
the
trap
.
How
he
came
there
,
I
know
*NL*
not
,
but
I
heard
his
voice
raised
in
a
tone
of
imperious
command
,
and
*NL*
looking
towards
the
sound
,
saw
him
stand
in
the
roadway
.
As
he
swept
his
*NL*
long
arms
,
as
though
brushing
aside
some
impalpable
obstacle
,
the
wolves
*NL*
fell
back
and
back
further
still
.
Just
then
a
heavy
cloud
passed
across
*NL*
the
face
of
the
moon
,
so
that
we
were
again
in
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
could
see
again
the
driver
was
climbing
into
the
caleche
,
and
the
*NL*
wolves
had
disappeared
.
This
was
all
so
strange
and
uncanny
that
a
*NL*
dreadful
fear
came
upon
me
,
and
I
was
afraid
to
speak
or
move
.
The
time
*NL*
seemed
interminable
as
we
swept
on
our
way
,
now
in
almost
complete
*NL*
darkness
,
for
the
rolling
clouds
obscured
the
moon
.
We
kept
on
*NL*
ascending
,
with
occasional
periods
of
quick
descent
,
but
in
the
main
*NL*
always
ascending
.
Suddenly
,
I
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
driver
was
in
the
act
of
pulling
up
the
horses
in
the
courtyard
of
a
*NL*
vast
ruined
castle
,
from
whose
tall
black
windows
came
no
ray
of
light

*NL*
and
whose
broken
battlements
showed
a
jagged
line
against
the
moonlit
*NL*

I
must
have
been
asleep
,
for
certainly
if
I
had
been
fully
*NL*
awake
I
must
have
noticed
the
approach
of
such
a
remarkable
place
.
In
*NL*
the
gloom
the
courtyard
looked
of
considerable
size
,
and
as
several
dark
*NL*
ways
led
from
it
under
great
round
arches
,
it
perhaps
seemed
bigger
than
*NL*
it
really
is
.
I
have
not
yet
been
able
to
see
it
by
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
caleche
stopped
,
the
driver
jumped
down
and
held
out
his
hand
*NL*
to
assist
me
to
alight
.
Again
I
could
not
but
notice
his
prodigious
*NL*
strength
.
His
hand
actually
seemed
like
a
steel
vice
that
could
have
*NL*
crushed
mine
if
he
had
chosen
.
Then
he
took
out
my
traps
,
and
placed
*NL*
them
on
the
ground
beside
me
as
I
stood
close
to
a
great
door
,
old
and
*NL*
studded
with
large
iron
nails
,
and
set
in
a
projecting
doorway
of
*NL*
massive
stone
.
I
could
see
even
in
the
dim
light
that
the
stone
was
*NL*
massively
carved
,
but
that
the
carving
had
been
much
worn
by
time
and
*NL*
weather
.
As
I
stood
,
the
driver
jumped
again
into
his
seat
and
shook
the
*NL*
reins
;
the
horses
started
forward
,
and
trap
and
all
disappeared
down
one
*NL*
of
the
dark
openings
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
in
silence
where
I
was
,
for
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
Of
bell
*NL*
or
knocker
there
was
no
sign
;
through
these
frowning
walls
and
dark
*NL*
window
openings
it
was
not
likely
that
my
voice
could
penetrate
.
The
*NL*
time
I
waited
seemed
endless
,
and
I
felt
doubts
and
fears
crowding
upon
*NL*
me
.
What
sort
of
place
had
I
come
to
,
and
among
what
kind
of
people
?
*NL*
What
sort
of
grim
adventure
was
it
on
which
I
had
embarked
?
Was
this
a
*NL*
customary
incident
in
the
life
of
a
solicitor
's
clerk
sent
out
to
*NL*
explain
the
purchase
of
a
London
estate
to
a
foreigner
?
Solicitor
's
*NL*
clerk
!
Mina
would
not
like
that
.
Solicitor
--
for
just
before
leaving
*NL*
London
I
got
word
that
my
examination
was
successful
;
and
I
am
now
a
*NL*
full-blown
solicitor
!
I
began
to
rub
my
eyes
and
pinch
myself
to
see
if
*NL*
I
were
awake
.
It
all
seemed
like
a
horrible
nightmare
to
me
,
and
I
*NL*
expected
that
I
should
suddenly
awake
,
and
find
myself
at
home
,
with
*NL*
the
dawn
struggling
in
through
the
windows
,
as
I
had
now
and
again
felt
*NL*
in
the
morning
after
a
day
of
overwork
.
But
my
flesh
answered
the
*NL*
pinching
test
,
and
my
eyes
were
not
to
be
deceived
.
I
was
indeed
awake
*NL*
and
among
the
Carpathians
.
All
I
could
do
now
was
to
be
patient
,
and
to
*NL*
wait
the
coming
of
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
I
had
come
to
this
conclusion
I
heard
a
heavy
step
approaching
*NL*
behind
the
great
door
,
and
saw
through
the
chinks
the
gleam
of
a
coming
*NL*
light
.
Then
there
was
the
sound
of
rattling
chains
and
the
clanking
of
*NL*
massive
bolts
drawn
back
.
A
key
was
turned
with
the
loud
grating
noise
*NL*
of
long
disuse
,
and
the
great
door
swung
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
,
stood
a
tall
old
man
,
clean
shaven
save
for
a
long
white
*NL*
moustache
,
and
clad
in
black
from
head
to
foot
,
without
a
single
speck
*NL*
of
colour
about
him
anywhere
.
He
held
in
his
hand
an
antique
silver
*NL*
lamp
,
in
which
the
flame
burned
without
chimney
or
globe
of
any
kind
,
*NL*
throwing
long
quivering
shadows
as
it
flickered
in
the
draught
of
the
*NL*
open
door
.
The
old
man
motioned
me
in
with
his
right
hand
with
a
courtly
*NL*
gesture
,
saying
in
excellent
English
,
but
with
a
strange
intonation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome
to
my
house
!
Enter
freely
and
of
your
own
will
!
''
He
made
no
*NL*
motion
of
stepping
to
meet
me
,
but
stood
like
a
statue
,
as
though
his
*NL*
gesture
of
welcome
had
fixed
him
into
stone
.
The
instant
,
however
,
that
*NL*
I
had
stepped
over
the
threshold
,
he
moved
impulsively
forward
,
and
*NL*
holding
out
his
hand
grasped
mine
with
a
strength
which
made
me
wince
,
*NL*
an
effect
which
was
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that
it
seemed
as
cold
as
*NL*
ice
--
more
like
the
hand
of
a
dead
than
a
living
man
.
Again
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome
to
my
house
.
Come
freely
.
Go
safely
;
and
leave
something
of
the
*NL*
happiness
you
bring
!
''
The
strength
of
the
handshake
was
so
much
akin
to
*NL*
that
which
I
had
noticed
in
the
driver
,
whose
face
I
had
not
seen
,
that
*NL*
for
a
moment
I
doubted
if
it
were
not
the
same
person
to
whom
I
was
*NL*
speaking
;
so
to
make
sure
,
I
said
interrogatively
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Dracula
?
''
He
bowed
in
a
courtly
way
as
he
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Dracula
;
and
I
bid
you
welcome
,
Mr.
Harker
,
to
my
house
.
Come
in
;
*NL*
the
night
air
is
chill
,
and
you
must
need
to
eat
and
rest
.
''
As
he
was
*NL*
speaking
,
he
put
the
lamp
on
a
bracket
on
the
wall
,
and
stepping
out
,
*NL*
took
my
luggage
;
he
had
carried
it
in
before
I
could
forestall
him
.
I
*NL*
protested
but
he
insisted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
sir
,
you
are
my
guest
.
It
is
late
,
and
my
people
are
not
*NL*
available
.
Let
me
see
to
your
comfort
myself
.
''
He
insisted
on
carrying
*NL*
my
traps
along
the
passage
,
and
then
up
a
great
winding
stair
,
and
*NL*
along
another
great
passage
,
on
whose
stone
floor
our
steps
rang
*NL*
heavily
.
At
the
end
of
this
he
threw
open
a
heavy
door
,
and
I
rejoiced
*NL*
to
see
within
a
well-lit
room
in
which
a
table
was
spread
for
supper
,
*NL*
and
on
whose
mighty
hearth
a
great
fire
of
logs
,
freshly
replenished
,
*NL*
flamed
and
flared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
halted
,
putting
down
my
bags
,
closed
the
door
,
and
crossing
*NL*
the
room
,
opened
another
door
,
which
led
into
a
small
octagonal
room
lit
*NL*
by
a
single
lamp
,
and
seemingly
without
a
window
of
any
sort
.
Passing
*NL*
through
this
,
he
opened
another
door
,
and
motioned
me
to
enter
.
It
was
a
*NL*
welcome
sight
;
for
here
was
a
great
bedroom
well
lighted
and
warmed
with
*NL*
another
log
fire
,
--
also
added
to
but
lately
,
for
the
top
logs
were
*NL*
fresh
--
which
sent
a
hollow
roar
up
the
wide
chimney
.
The
Count
himself
*NL*
left
my
luggage
inside
and
withdrew
,
saying
,
before
he
closed
the
*NL*
door
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
need
,
after
your
journey
,
to
refresh
yourself
by
making
your
*NL*
toilet
.
I
trust
you
will
find
all
you
wish
.
When
you
are
ready
,
come
*NL*
into
the
other
room
,
where
you
will
find
your
supper
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
and
warmth
and
the
Count
's
courteous
welcome
seemed
to
have
*NL*
dissipated
all
my
doubts
and
fears
.
Having
then
reached
my
normal
state
,
*NL*
I
discovered
that
I
was
half
famished
with
hunger
;
so
making
a
hasty
*NL*
toilet
,
I
went
into
the
other
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
supper
already
laid
out
.
My
host
,
who
stood
on
one
side
of
the
*NL*
great
fireplace
,
leaning
against
the
stonework
,
made
a
graceful
wave
of
*NL*
his
hand
to
the
table
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pray
you
,
be
seated
and
sup
how
you
please
.
You
will
,
I
trust
,
excuse
*NL*
me
that
I
do
not
join
you
;
but
I
have
dined
already
,
and
I
do
not
sup
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
handed
to
him
the
sealed
letter
which
Mr.
Hawkins
had
entrusted
to
me
.
*NL*
He
opened
it
and
read
it
gravely
;
then
,
with
a
charming
smile
,
he
handed
*NL*
it
to
me
to
read
.
One
passage
of
it
,
at
least
,
gave
me
a
thrill
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
regret
that
an
attack
of
gout
,
from
which
malady
I
am
a
constant
*NL*
sufferer
,
forbids
absolutely
any
travelling
on
my
part
for
some
time
to
*NL*
come
;
but
I
am
happy
to
say
I
can
send
a
sufficient
substitute
,
one
in
*NL*
whom
I
have
every
possible
confidence
.
He
is
a
young
man
,
full
of
energy
*NL*
and
talent
in
his
own
way
,
and
of
a
very
faithful
disposition
.
He
is
*NL*
discreet
and
silent
,
and
has
grown
into
manhood
in
my
service
.
He
shall
*NL*
be
ready
to
attend
on
you
when
you
will
during
his
stay
,
and
shall
take
*NL*
your
instructions
in
all
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
himself
came
forward
and
took
off
the
cover
of
a
dish
,
and
I
*NL*
fell
to
at
once
on
an
excellent
roast
chicken
.
This
,
with
some
cheese
*NL*
and
a
salad
and
a
bottle
of
old
Tokay
,
of
which
I
had
two
glasses
,
was
*NL*
my
supper
.
During
the
time
I
was
eating
it
the
Count
asked
me
many
*NL*
questions
as
to
my
journey
,
and
I
told
him
by
degrees
all
I
had
*NL*
experienced
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
I
had
finished
my
supper
,
and
by
my
host
's
desire
had
drawn
*NL*
up
a
chair
by
the
fire
and
begun
to
smoke
a
cigar
which
he
offered
me
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
excusing
himself
that
he
did
not
smoke
.
I
had
now
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
observing
him
,
and
found
him
of
a
very
marked
*NL*
physiognomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
was
a
strong
--
a
very
strong
--
aquiline
,
with
high
bridge
of
the
*NL*
thin
nose
and
peculiarly
arched
nostrils
;
with
lofty
domed
forehead
,
and
*NL*
hair
growing
scantily
round
the
temples
but
profusely
elsewhere
.
His
*NL*
eyebrows
were
very
massive
,
almost
meeting
over
the
nose
,
and
with
bushy
*NL*
hair
that
seemed
to
curl
in
its
own
profusion
.
The
mouth
,
so
far
as
I
*NL*
could
see
it
under
the
heavy
moustache
,
was
fixed
and
rather
*NL*
cruel-looking
,
with
peculiarly
sharp
white
teeth
;
these
protruded
over
*NL*
the
lips
,
whose
remarkable
ruddiness
showed
astonishing
vitality
in
a
*NL*
man
of
his
years
.
For
the
rest
,
his
ears
were
pale
,
and
at
the
tops
*NL*
extremely
pointed
;
the
chin
was
broad
and
strong
,
and
the
cheeks
firm
*NL*
though
thin
.
The
general
effect
was
one
of
extraordinary
pallor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hitherto
I
had
noticed
the
backs
of
his
hands
as
they
lay
on
his
knees
*NL*
in
the
firelight
,
and
they
had
seemed
rather
white
and
fine
;
but
seeing
*NL*
them
now
close
to
me
,
I
could
not
but
notice
that
they
were
rather
*NL*
coarse
--
broad
,
with
squat
fingers
.
Strange
to
say
,
there
were
hairs
in
*NL*
the
centre
of
the
palm
.
The
nails
were
long
and
fine
,
and
cut
to
a
sharp
*NL*
point
.
As
the
Count
leaned
over
me
and
his
hands
touched
me
,
I
could
not
*NL*
repress
a
shudder
.
It
may
have
been
that
his
breath
was
rank
,
but
a
*NL*
horrible
feeling
of
nausea
came
over
me
,
which
,
do
what
I
would
,
I
could
*NL*
not
conceal
.
The
Count
,
evidently
noticing
it
,
drew
back
;
and
with
a
*NL*
grim
sort
of
smile
,
which
showed
more
than
he
had
yet
done
his
*NL*
protuberant
teeth
,
sat
himself
down
again
on
his
own
side
of
the
*NL*
fireplace
.
We
were
both
silent
for
a
while
;
and
as
I
looked
towards
the
*NL*
window
I
saw
the
first
dim
streak
of
the
coming
dawn
.
There
seemed
a
*NL*
strange
stillness
over
everything
;
but
as
I
listened
I
heard
as
if
from
*NL*
down
below
in
the
valley
the
howling
of
many
wolves
.
The
Count
's
eyes
*NL*
gleamed
,
and
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
them
--
the
children
of
the
night
.
What
music
they
make
!
''
*NL*
Seeing
,
I
suppose
,
some
expression
in
my
face
strange
to
him
,
he
*NL*
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
sir
,
you
dwellers
in
the
city
can
not
enter
into
the
feelings
of
the
*NL*
hunter
.
''
Then
he
rose
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
be
tired
.
Your
bedroom
is
all
ready
,
and
to-morrow
you
*NL*
shall
sleep
as
late
as
you
will
.
I
have
to
be
away
till
the
afternoon
;
*NL*
so
sleep
well
and
dream
well
!
''
With
a
courteous
bow
,
he
opened
for
me
*NL*
himself
the
door
to
the
octagonal
room
,
and
I
entered
my
bedroom
...
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
all
in
a
sea
of
wonders
.
I
doubt
;
I
fear
;
I
think
strange
things
,
*NL*
which
I
dare
not
confess
to
my
own
soul
.
God
keep
me
,
if
only
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
those
dear
to
me
!

7
May

_
--
It
is
again
early
morning
,
but
I
have
rested
and
enjoyed
the
*NL*
last
twenty-four
hours
.
I
slept
till
late
in
the
day
,
and
awoke
of
my
*NL*
own
accord
.
When
I
had
dressed
myself
I
went
into
the
room
where
we
had
*NL*
supped
,
and
found
a
cold
breakfast
laid
out
,
with
coffee
kept
hot
by
the
*NL*
pot
being
placed
on
the
hearth
.
There
was
a
card
on
the
table
,
on
which
*NL*
was
written
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
to
be
absent
for
a
while
.
Do
not
wait
for
me
.

set
to
and
*NL*
enjoyed
a
hearty
meal
.
When
I
had
done
,
I
looked
for
a
bell
,
so
that
I
*NL*
might
let
the
servants
know
I
had
finished
;
but
I
could
not
find
one
.
*NL*
There
are
certainly
odd
deficiencies
in
the
house
,
considering
the
*NL*
extraordinary
evidences
of
wealth
which
are
round
me
.
The
table
service
*NL*
is
of
gold
,
and
so
beautifully
wrought
that
it
must
be
of
immense
value
.
*NL*
The
curtains
and
upholstery
of
the
chairs
and
sofas
and
the
hangings
of
*NL*
my
bed
are
of
the
costliest
and
most
beautiful
fabrics
,
and
must
have
*NL*
been
of
fabulous
value
when
they
were
made
,
for
they
are
centuries
old
,
*NL*
though
in
excellent
order
.
I
saw
something
like
them
in
Hampton
Court
,
*NL*
but
there
they
were
worn
and
frayed
and
moth-eaten
.
But
still
in
none
of
*NL*
the
rooms
is
there
a
mirror
.
There
is
not
even
a
toilet
glass
on
my
*NL*
table
,
and
I
had
to
get
the
little
shaving
glass
from
my
bag
before
I
*NL*
could
either
shave
or
brush
my
hair
.
I
have
not
yet
seen
a
servant
*NL*
anywhere
,
or
heard
a
sound
near
the
castle
except
the
howling
of
wolves
.
*NL*
Some
time
after
I
had
finished
my
meal
--
I
do
not
know
whether
to
call
it
*NL*
breakfast
or
dinner
,
for
it
was
between
five
and
six
o'clock
when
I
had
*NL*
it
--
I
looked
about
for
something
to
read
,
for
I
did
not
like
to
go
about
*NL*
the
castle
until
I
had
asked
the
Count
's
permission
.
There
was
*NL*
absolutely
nothing
in
the
room
,
book
,
newspaper
,
or
even
writing
*NL*
materials
;
so
I
opened
another
door
in
the
room
and
found
a
sort
of
*NL*
library
.
The
door
opposite
mine
I
tried
,
but
found
it
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
library
I
found
,
to
my
great
delight
,
a
vast
number
of
English
*NL*
books
,
whole
shelves
full
of
them
,
and
bound
volumes
of
magazines
and
*NL*
newspapers
.
A
table
in
the
centre
was
littered
with
English
magazines
*NL*
and
newspapers
,
though
none
of
them
were
of
very
recent
date
.
The
books
*NL*
were
of
the
most
varied
kind
--
history
,
geography
,
politics
,
political
*NL*
economy
,
botany
,
geology
,
law
--
all
relating
to
England
and
English
life
*NL*
and
customs
and
manners
.
There
were
even
such
books
of
reference
as
the
*NL*
London
Directory
,
the
``
Red
''
and
``
Blue
''
books
,
Whitaker
's
Almanac
,
the
*NL*
Army
and
Navy
Lists
,
and
--
it
somehow
gladdened
my
heart
to
see
it
--
the
*NL*
Law
List
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
I
was
looking
at
the
books
,
the
door
opened
,
and
the
Count
*NL*
entered
.
He
saluted
me
in
a
hearty
way
,
and
hoped
that
I
had
had
a
good
*NL*
night
's
rest
.
Then
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
found
your
way
in
here
,
for
I
am
sure
there
is
much
that
*NL*
will
interest
you
.
These
companions
''
--
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
some
of
*NL*
the
books
--
``
have
been
good
friends
to
me
,
and
for
some
years
past
,
ever
*NL*
since
I
had
the
idea
of
going
to
London
,
have
given
me
many
,
many
hours
*NL*
of
pleasure
.
Through
them
I
have
come
to
know
your
great
England
;
and
to
*NL*
know
her
is
to
love
her
.
I
long
to
go
through
the
crowded
streets
of
*NL*
your
mighty
London
,
to
be
in
the
midst
of
the
whirl
and
rush
of
*NL*
humanity
,
to
share
its
life
,
its
change
,
its
death
,
and
all
that
makes
*NL*
it
what
it
is
.
But
alas
!
as
yet
I
only
know
your
tongue
through
books
.
*NL*
To
you
,
my
friend
,
I
look
that
I
know
it
to
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Count
,
''
I
said
,
``
you
know
and
speak
English
thoroughly
!
''
He
bowed
*NL*
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
my
friend
,
for
your
all
too-flattering
estimate
,
but
yet
I
*NL*
fear
that
I
am
but
a
little
way
on
the
road
I
would
travel
.
True
,
I
know
*NL*
the
grammar
and
the
words
,
but
yet
I
know
not
how
to
speak
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
I
said
,
``
you
speak
excellently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
,
''
he
answered
.
``
Well
,
I
know
that
,
did
I
move
and
speak
in
your
*NL*
London
,
none
there
are
who
would
not
know
me
for
a
stranger
.
That
is
not
*NL*
enough
for
me
.
Here
I
am
noble
;
I
am
_
boyar
_
;
the
common
people
know
me
,
*NL*
and
I
am
master
.
But
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
,
he
is
no
one
;
men
*NL*
know
him
not
--
and
to
know
not
is
to
care
not
for
.
I
am
content
if
I
am
*NL*
like
the
rest
,
so
that
no
man
stops
if
he
see
me
,
or
pause
in
his
*NL*
speaking
if
he
hear
my
words
,
`
Ha
,
ha
!
a
stranger
!
'
I
have
been
so
long
*NL*
master
that
I
would
be
master
still
--
or
at
least
that
none
other
should
*NL*
be
master
of
me
.
You
come
to
me
not
alone
as
agent
of
my
friend
Peter
*NL*
Hawkins
,
of
Exeter
,
to
tell
me
all
about
my
new
estate
in
London
.
You
*NL*
shall
,
I
trust
,
rest
here
with
me
awhile
,
so
that
by
our
talking
I
may
*NL*
learn
the
English
intonation
;
and
I
would
that
you
tell
me
when
I
make
*NL*
error
,
even
of
the
smallest
,
in
my
speaking
.
I
am
sorry
that
I
had
to
be
*NL*
away
so
long
to-day
;
but
you
will
,
I
know
,
forgive
one
who
has
so
many
*NL*
important
affairs
in
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
said
all
I
could
about
being
willing
,
and
asked
if
I
might
*NL*
come
into
that
room
when
I
chose
.
He
answered
:
``
Yes
,
certainly
,
''
and
*NL*
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
go
anywhere
you
wish
in
the
castle
,
except
where
the
doors
are
*NL*
locked
,
where
of
course
you
will
not
wish
to
go
.
There
is
reason
that
*NL*
all
things
are
as
they
are
,
and
did
you
see
with
my
eyes
and
know
with
*NL*
my
knowledge
,
you
would
perhaps
better
understand
.
''
I
said
I
was
sure
of
*NL*
this
,
and
then
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
in
Transylvania
;
and
Transylvania
is
not
England
.
Our
ways
are
*NL*
not
your
ways
,
and
there
shall
be
to
you
many
strange
things
.
Nay
,
from
*NL*
what
you
have
told
me
of
your
experiences
already
,
you
know
something
of
*NL*
what
strange
things
there
may
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
led
to
much
conversation
;
and
as
it
was
evident
that
he
wanted
to
*NL*
talk
,
if
only
for
talking
's
sake
,
I
asked
him
many
questions
regarding
*NL*
things
that
had
already
happened
to
me
or
come
within
my
notice
.
*NL*
Sometimes
he
sheered
off
the
subject
,
or
turned
the
conversation
by
*NL*
pretending
not
to
understand
;
but
generally
he
answered
all
I
asked
most
*NL*
frankly
.
Then
as
time
went
on
,
and
I
had
got
somewhat
bolder
,
I
asked
*NL*
him
of
some
of
the
strange
things
of
the
preceding
night
,
as
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
why
the
coachman
went
to
the
places
where
he
had
seen
the
blue
*NL*
flames
.
He
then
explained
to
me
that
it
was
commonly
believed
that
on
a
*NL*
certain
night
of
the
year
--
last
night
,
in
fact
,
when
all
evil
spirits
*NL*
are
supposed
to
have
unchecked
sway
--
a
blue
flame
is
seen
over
any
place
*NL*
where
treasure
has
been
concealed
.
``
That
treasure
has
been
hidden
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
,
``
in
the
region
through
which
you
came
last
night
,
there
can
be
*NL*
but
little
doubt
;
for
it
was
the
ground
fought
over
for
centuries
by
the
*NL*
Wallachian
,
the
Saxon
,
and
the
Turk
.
Why
,
there
is
hardly
a
foot
of
soil
*NL*
in
all
this
region
that
has
not
been
enriched
by
the
blood
of
men
,
*NL*
patriots
or
invaders
.
In
old
days
there
were
stirring
times
,
when
the
*NL*
Austrian
and
the
Hungarian
came
up
in
hordes
,
and
the
patriots
went
out
*NL*
to
meet
them
--
men
and
women
,
the
aged
and
the
children
too
--
and
waited
*NL*
their
coming
on
the
rocks
above
the
passes
,
that
they
might
sweep
*NL*
destruction
on
them
with
their
artificial
avalanches
.
When
the
invader
*NL*
was
triumphant
he
found
but
little
,
for
whatever
there
was
had
been
*NL*
sheltered
in
the
friendly
soil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
,
''
said
I
,
``
can
it
have
remained
so
long
undiscovered
,
when
*NL*
there
is
a
sure
index
to
it
if
men
will
but
take
the
trouble
to
look
?
''
*NL*
The
Count
smiled
,
and
as
his
lips
ran
back
over
his
gums
,
the
long
,
*NL*
sharp
,
canine
teeth
showed
out
strangely
;
he
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
your
peasant
is
at
heart
a
coward
and
a
fool
!
Those
flames
only
*NL*
appear
on
one
night
;
and
on
that
night
no
man
of
this
land
will
,
if
he
*NL*
can
help
it
,
stir
without
his
doors
.
And
,
dear
sir
,
even
if
he
did
he
*NL*
would
not
know
what
to
do
.
Why
,
even
the
peasant
that
you
tell
me
of
who
*NL*
marked
the
place
of
the
flame
would
not
know
where
to
look
in
daylight
*NL*
even
for
his
own
work
.
Even
you
would
not
,
I
dare
be
sworn
,
be
able
to
*NL*
find
these
places
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
are
right
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
know
no
more
than
the
dead
where
even
*NL*
to
look
for
them
.
''
Then
we
drifted
into
other
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
tell
me
of
London
and
of
the
house
which
you
*NL*
have
procured
for
me
.
''
With
an
apology
for
my
remissness
,
I
went
into
my
*NL*
own
room
to
get
the
papers
from
my
bag
.
Whilst
I
was
placing
them
in
*NL*
order
I
heard
a
rattling
of
china
and
silver
in
the
next
room
,
and
as
I
*NL*
passed
through
,
noticed
that
the
table
had
been
cleared
and
the
lamp
*NL*
lit
,
for
it
was
by
this
time
deep
into
the
dark
.
The
lamps
were
also
lit
*NL*
in
the
study
or
library
,
and
I
found
the
Count
lying
on
the
sofa
,
*NL*
reading
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
an
English
Bradshaw
's
Guide
.
When
I
*NL*
came
in
he
cleared
the
books
and
papers
from
the
table
;
and
with
him
I
*NL*
went
into
plans
and
deeds
and
figures
of
all
sorts
.
He
was
interested
in
*NL*
everything
,
and
asked
me
a
myriad
questions
about
the
place
and
its
*NL*
surroundings
.
He
clearly
had
studied
beforehand
all
he
could
get
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
the
neighbourhood
,
for
he
evidently
at
the
end
knew
very
much
*NL*
more
than
I
did
.
When
I
remarked
this
,
he
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
,
my
friend
,
is
it
not
needful
that
I
should
?
When
I
go
there
*NL*
I
shall
be
all
alone
,
and
my
friend
Harker
Jonathan
--
nay
,
pardon
me
,
I
*NL*
fall
into
my
country
's
habit
of
putting
your
patronymic
first
--
my
friend
*NL*
Jonathan
Harker
will
not
be
by
my
side
to
correct
and
aid
me
.
He
will
be
*NL*
in
Exeter
,
miles
away
,
probably
working
at
papers
of
the
law
with
my
*NL*
other
friend
,
Peter
Hawkins
.
So
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
thoroughly
into
the
business
of
the
purchase
of
the
estate
at
*NL*
Purfleet
.
When
I
had
told
him
the
facts
and
got
his
signature
to
the
*NL*
necessary
papers
,
and
had
written
a
letter
with
them
ready
to
post
to
*NL*
Mr.
Hawkins
,
he
began
to
ask
me
how
I
had
come
across
so
suitable
a
*NL*
place
.
I
read
to
him
the
notes
which
I
had
made
at
the
time
,
and
which
I
*NL*
inscribe
here
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Purfleet
,
on
a
by-road
,
I
came
across
just
such
a
place
as
seemed
to
*NL*
be
required
,
and
where
was
displayed
a
dilapidated
notice
that
the
place
*NL*
was
for
sale
.
It
is
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
,
of
ancient
structure
,
*NL*
built
of
heavy
stones
,
and
has
not
been
repaired
for
a
large
number
of
*NL*
years
.
The
closed
gates
are
of
heavy
old
oak
and
iron
,
all
eaten
with
*NL*
rust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
estate
is
called
Carfax
,
no
doubt
a
corruption
of
the
old
_
Quatre
*NL*
Face
_
,
as
the
house
is
four-sided
,
agreeing
with
the
cardinal
points
of
*NL*
the
compass
.
It
contains
in
all
some
twenty
acres
,
quite
surrounded
by
*NL*
the
solid
stone
wall
above
mentioned
.
There
are
many
trees
on
it
,
which
*NL*
make
it
in
places
gloomy
,
and
there
is
a
deep
,
dark-looking
pond
or
*NL*
small
lake
,
evidently
fed
by
some
springs
,
as
the
water
is
clear
and
*NL*
flows
away
in
a
fair-sized
stream
.
The
house
is
very
large
and
of
all
*NL*
periods
back
,
I
should
say
,
to
mediaeval
times
,
for
one
part
is
of
stone
*NL*
immensely
thick
,
with
only
a
few
windows
high
up
and
heavily
barred
with
*NL*
iron
.
It
looks
like
part
of
a
keep
,
and
is
close
to
an
old
chapel
or
*NL*
church
.
I
could
not
enter
it
,
as
I
had
not
the
key
of
the
door
leading
*NL*
to
it
from
the
house
,
but
I
have
taken
with
my
kodak
views
of
it
from
*NL*
various
points
.
The
house
has
been
added
to
,
but
in
a
very
straggling
*NL*
way
,
and
I
can
only
guess
at
the
amount
of
ground
it
covers
,
which
must
*NL*
be
very
great
.
There
are
but
few
houses
close
at
hand
,
one
being
a
very
*NL*
large
house
only
recently
added
to
and
formed
into
a
private
lunatic
*NL*
asylum
.
It
is
not
,
however
,
visible
from
the
grounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
finished
,
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
that
it
is
old
and
big
.
I
myself
am
of
an
old
family
,
and
to
*NL*
live
in
a
new
house
would
kill
me
.
A
house
can
not
be
made
habitable
in
a
*NL*
day
;
and
,
after
all
,
how
few
days
go
to
make
up
a
century
.
I
rejoice
*NL*
also
that
there
is
a
chapel
of
old
times
.
We
Transylvanian
nobles
love
*NL*
not
to
think
that
our
bones
may
lie
amongst
the
common
dead
.
I
seek
not
*NL*
gaiety
nor
mirth
,
not
the
bright
voluptuousness
of
much
sunshine
and
*NL*
sparkling
waters
which
please
the
young
and
gay
.
I
am
no
longer
young
;
*NL*
and
my
heart
,
through
weary
years
of
mourning
over
the
dead
,
is
not
*NL*
attuned
to
mirth
.
Moreover
,
the
walls
of
my
castle
are
broken
;
the
*NL*
shadows
are
many
,
and
the
wind
breathes
cold
through
the
broken
*NL*
battlements
and
casements
.
I
love
the
shade
and
the
shadow
,
and
would
*NL*
be
alone
with
my
thoughts
when
I
may
.
''
Somehow
his
words
and
his
look
*NL*
did
not
seem
to
accord
,
or
else
it
was
that
his
cast
of
face
made
his
*NL*
smile
look
malignant
and
saturnine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
with
an
excuse
,
he
left
me
,
asking
me
to
put
all
my
papers
*NL*
together
.
He
was
some
little
time
away
,
and
I
began
to
look
at
some
of
*NL*
the
books
around
me
.
One
was
an
atlas
,
which
I
found
opened
naturally
at
*NL*
England
,
as
if
that
map
had
been
much
used
.
On
looking
at
it
I
found
in
*NL*
certain
places
little
rings
marked
,
and
on
examining
these
I
noticed
*NL*
that
one
was
near
London
on
the
east
side
,
manifestly
where
his
new
*NL*
estate
was
situated
;
the
other
two
were
Exeter
,
and
Whitby
on
the
*NL*
Yorkshire
coast
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
better
part
of
an
hour
when
the
Count
returned
.
``
Aha
!
''
he
*NL*
said
;
``
still
at
your
books
?
Good
!
But
you
must
not
work
always
.
Come
;
I
*NL*
am
informed
that
your
supper
is
ready
.
''
He
took
my
arm
,
and
we
went
into
*NL*
the
next
room
,
where
I
found
an
excellent
supper
ready
on
the
table
.
The
*NL*
Count
again
excused
himself
,
as
he
had
dined
out
on
his
being
away
from
*NL*
home
.
But
he
sat
as
on
the
previous
night
,
and
chatted
whilst
I
ate
.
*NL*
After
supper
I
smoked
,
as
on
the
last
evening
,
and
the
Count
stayed
with
*NL*
me
,
chatting
and
asking
questions
on
every
conceivable
subject
,
hour
*NL*
after
hour
.
I
felt
that
it
was
getting
very
late
indeed
,
but
I
did
not
*NL*
say
anything
,
for
I
felt
under
obligation
to
meet
my
host
's
wishes
in
*NL*
every
way
.
I
was
not
sleepy
,
as
the
long
sleep
yesterday
had
fortified
*NL*
me
;
but
I
could
not
help
experiencing
that
chill
which
comes
over
one
at
*NL*
the
coming
of
the
dawn
,
which
is
like
,
in
its
way
,
the
turn
of
the
tide
.
*NL*
They
say
that
people
who
are
near
death
die
generally
at
the
change
to
*NL*
the
dawn
or
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
;
any
one
who
has
when
tired
,
and
*NL*
tied
as
it
were
to
his
post
,
experienced
this
change
in
the
atmosphere
*NL*
can
well
believe
it
.
All
at
once
we
heard
the
crow
of
a
cock
coming
up
*NL*
with
preternatural
shrillness
through
the
clear
morning
air
;
Count
*NL*
Dracula
,
jumping
to
his
feet
,
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
is
the
morning
again
!
How
remiss
I
am
to
let
you
stay
up
so
*NL*
long
.
You
must
make
your
conversation
regarding
my
dear
new
country
of
*NL*
England
less
interesting
,
so
that
I
may
not
forget
how
time
flies
by
*NL*
us
,
''
and
,
with
a
courtly
bow
,
he
quickly
left
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
into
my
own
room
and
drew
the
curtains
,
but
there
was
little
to
*NL*
notice
;
my
window
opened
into
the
courtyard
,
all
I
could
see
was
the
*NL*
warm
grey
of
quickening
sky
.
So
I
pulled
the
curtains
again
,
and
have
*NL*
written
of
this
day
.

_
8
May
.
_
--
I
began
to
fear
as
I
wrote
in
this
book
that
I
was
getting
too
*NL*
diffuse
;
but
now
I
am
glad
that
I
went
into
detail
from
the
first
,
for
*NL*
there
is
something
so
strange
about
this
place
and
all
in
it
that
I
*NL*
can
not
but
feel
uneasy
.
I
wish
I
were
safe
out
of
it
,
or
that
I
had
*NL*
never
come
.
It
may
be
that
this
strange
night-existence
is
telling
on
*NL*
me
;
but
would
that
that
were
all
!
If
there
were
any
one
to
talk
to
I
*NL*
could
bear
it
,
but
there
is
no
one
.
I
have
only
the
Count
to
speak
with
,
*NL*
and
he
!
--
I
fear
I
am
myself
the
only
living
soul
within
the
place
.
Let
*NL*
me
be
prosaic
so
far
as
facts
can
be
;
it
will
help
me
to
bear
up
,
and
*NL*
imagination
must
not
run
riot
with
me
.
If
it
does
I
am
lost
.
Let
me
say
*NL*
at
once
how
I
stand
--
or
seem
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
only
slept
a
few
hours
when
I
went
to
bed
,
and
feeling
that
I
could
*NL*
not
sleep
any
more
,
got
up
.
I
had
hung
my
shaving
glass
by
the
window
,
*NL*
and
was
just
beginning
to
shave
.
Suddenly
I
felt
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
heard
the
Count
's
voice
saying
to
me
,
``
Good-morning
.
''
I
started
,
for
*NL*
it
amazed
me
that
I
had
not
seen
him
,
since
the
reflection
of
the
glass
*NL*
covered
the
whole
room
behind
me
.
In
starting
I
had
cut
myself
slightly
,
*NL*
but
did
not
notice
it
at
the
moment
.
Having
answered
the
Count
's
*NL*
salutation
,
I
turned
to
the
glass
again
to
see
how
I
had
been
mistaken
.
*NL*
This
time
there
could
be
no
error
,
for
the
man
was
close
to
me
,
and
I
*NL*
could
see
him
over
my
shoulder
.
But
there
was
no
reflection
of
him
in
*NL*
the
mirror
!
The
whole
room
behind
me
was
displayed
;
but
there
was
no
*NL*
sign
of
a
man
in
it
,
except
myself
.
This
was
startling
,
and
,
coming
on
*NL*
the
top
of
so
many
strange
things
,
was
beginning
to
increase
that
vague
*NL*
feeling
of
uneasiness
which
I
always
have
when
the
Count
is
near
;
but
at
*NL*
the
instant
I
saw
that
the
cut
had
bled
a
little
,
and
the
blood
was
*NL*
trickling
over
my
chin
.
I
laid
down
the
razor
,
turning
as
I
did
so
half
*NL*
round
to
look
for
some
sticking
plaster
.
When
the
Count
saw
my
face
,
his
*NL*
eyes
blazed
with
a
sort
of
demoniac
fury
,
and
he
suddenly
made
a
grab
at
*NL*
my
throat
.
I
drew
away
,
and
his
hand
touched
the
string
of
beads
which
*NL*
held
the
crucifix
.
It
made
an
instant
change
in
him
,
for
the
fury
passed
*NL*
so
quickly
that
I
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
ever
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
''
he
said
,
``
take
care
how
you
cut
yourself
.
It
is
more
*NL*
dangerous
than
you
think
in
this
country
.
''
Then
seizing
the
shaving
*NL*
glass
,
he
went
on
:
``
And
this
is
the
wretched
thing
that
has
done
the
*NL*
mischief
.
It
is
a
foul
bauble
of
man
's
vanity
.
Away
with
it
!
''
and
*NL*
opening
the
heavy
window
with
one
wrench
of
his
terrible
hand
,
he
flung
*NL*
out
the
glass
,
which
was
shattered
into
a
thousand
pieces
on
the
stones
*NL*
of
the
courtyard
far
below
.
Then
he
withdrew
without
a
word
.
It
is
very
*NL*
annoying
,
for
I
do
not
see
how
I
am
to
shave
,
unless
in
my
watch-case
or
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
shaving-pot
,
which
is
fortunately
of
metal
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
went
into
the
dining-room
,
breakfast
was
prepared
;
but
I
could
*NL*
not
find
the
Count
anywhere
.
So
I
breakfasted
alone
.
It
is
strange
that
*NL*
as
yet
I
have
not
seen
the
Count
eat
or
drink
.
He
must
be
a
very
*NL*
peculiar
man
!
After
breakfast
I
did
a
little
exploring
in
the
castle
.
I
*NL*
went
out
on
the
stairs
,
and
found
a
room
looking
towards
the
South
.
The
*NL*
view
was
magnificent
,
and
from
where
I
stood
there
was
every
opportunity
*NL*
of
seeing
it
.
The
castle
is
on
the
very
edge
of
a
terrible
precipice
.
A
*NL*
stone
falling
from
the
window
would
fall
a
thousand
feet
without
*NL*
touching
anything
!
As
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
is
a
sea
of
green
tree
*NL*
tops
,
with
occasionally
a
deep
rift
where
there
is
a
chasm
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
are
silver
threads
where
the
rivers
wind
in
deep
gorges
through
*NL*
the
forests
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
am
not
in
heart
to
describe
beauty
,
for
when
I
had
seen
the
view
I
*NL*
explored
further
;
doors
,
doors
,
doors
everywhere
,
and
all
locked
and
*NL*
bolted
.
In
no
place
save
from
the
windows
in
the
castle
walls
is
there
*NL*
an
available
exit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
castle
is
a
veritable
prison
,
and
I
am
a
prisoner
!

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
JONATHAN
HARKER
'S
JOURNAL
--
_
continued
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
found
that
I
was
a
prisoner
a
sort
of
wild
feeling
came
over
me
.
*NL*
I
rushed
up
and
down
the
stairs
,
trying
every
door
and
peering
out
of
*NL*
every
window
I
could
find
;
but
after
a
little
the
conviction
of
my
*NL*
helplessness
overpowered
all
other
feelings
.
When
I
look
back
after
a
*NL*
few
hours
I
think
I
must
have
been
mad
for
the
time
,
for
I
behaved
much
*NL*
as
a
rat
does
in
a
trap
.
When
,
however
,
the
conviction
had
come
to
me
*NL*
that
I
was
helpless
I
sat
down
quietly
--
as
quietly
as
I
have
ever
done
*NL*
anything
in
my
life
--
and
began
to
think
over
what
was
best
to
be
done
.
I
*NL*
am
thinking
still
,
and
as
yet
have
come
to
no
definite
conclusion
.
Of
*NL*
one
thing
only
am
I
certain
;
that
it
is
no
use
making
my
ideas
known
to
*NL*
the
Count
.
He
knows
well
that
I
am
imprisoned
;
and
as
he
has
done
it
*NL*
himself
,
and
has
doubtless
his
own
motives
for
it
,
he
would
only
deceive
*NL*
me
if
I
trusted
him
fully
with
the
facts
.
So
far
as
I
can
see
,
my
only
*NL*
plan
will
be
to
keep
my
knowledge
and
my
fears
to
myself
,
and
my
eyes
*NL*
open
.
I
am
,
I
know
,
either
being
deceived
,
like
a
baby
,
by
my
own
fears
,
*NL*
or
else
I
am
in
desperate
straits
;
and
if
the
latter
be
so
,
I
need
,
and
*NL*
shall
need
,
all
my
brains
to
get
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
hardly
come
to
this
conclusion
when
I
heard
the
great
door
below
*NL*
shut
,
and
knew
that
the
Count
had
returned
.
He
did
not
come
at
once
into
*NL*
the
library
,
so
I
went
cautiously
to
my
own
room
and
found
him
making
*NL*
the
bed
.
This
was
odd
,
but
only
confirmed
what
I
had
all
along
*NL*
thought
--
that
there
were
no
servants
in
the
house
.
When
later
I
saw
him
*NL*
through
the
chink
of
the
hinges
of
the
door
laying
the
table
in
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
I
was
assured
of
it
;
for
if
he
does
himself
all
these
*NL*
menial
offices
,
surely
it
is
proof
that
there
is
no
one
else
to
do
them
.
*NL*
This
gave
me
a
fright
,
for
if
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
castle
,
it
*NL*
must
have
been
the
Count
himself
who
was
the
driver
of
the
coach
that
*NL*
brought
me
here
.
This
is
a
terrible
thought
;
for
if
so
,
what
does
it
*NL*
mean
that
he
could
control
the
wolves
,
as
he
did
,
by
only
holding
up
his
*NL*
hand
in
silence
.
How
was
it
that
all
the
people
at
Bistritz
and
on
the
*NL*
coach
had
some
terrible
fear
for
me
?
What
meant
the
giving
of
the
*NL*
crucifix
,
of
the
garlic
,
of
the
wild
rose
,
of
the
mountain
ash
?
Bless
*NL*
that
good
,
good
woman
who
hung
the
crucifix
round
my
neck
!
for
it
is
a
*NL*
comfort
and
a
strength
to
me
whenever
I
touch
it
.
It
is
odd
that
a
thing
*NL*
which
I
have
been
taught
to
regard
with
disfavour
and
as
idolatrous
*NL*
should
in
a
time
of
loneliness
and
trouble
be
of
help
.
Is
it
that
there
*NL*
is
something
in
the
essence
of
the
thing
itself
,
or
that
it
is
a
medium
,
*NL*
a
tangible
help
,
in
conveying
memories
of
sympathy
and
comfort
?
Some
*NL*
time
,
if
it
may
be
,
I
must
examine
this
matter
and
try
to
make
up
my
*NL*
mind
about
it
.
In
the
meantime
I
must
find
out
all
I
can
about
Count
*NL*
Dracula
,
as
it
may
help
me
to
understand
.
To-night
he
may
talk
of
*NL*
himself
,
if
I
turn
the
conversation
that
way
.
I
must
be
very
careful
,
*NL*
however
,
not
to
awake
his
suspicion
.

_
Midnight
.
_
--
I
have
had
a
long
talk
with
the
Count
.
I
asked
him
a
few
*NL*
questions
on
Transylvania
history
,
and
he
warmed
up
to
the
subject
*NL*
wonderfully
.
In
his
speaking
of
things
and
people
,
and
especially
of
*NL*
battles
,
he
spoke
as
if
he
had
been
present
at
them
all
.
This
he
*NL*
afterwards
explained
by
saying
that
to
a
_
boyar
_
the
pride
of
his
house
*NL*
and
name
is
his
own
pride
,
that
their
glory
is
his
glory
,
that
their
*NL*
fate
is
his
fate
.
Whenever
he
spoke
of
his
house
he
always
said
``
we
,
''
*NL*
and
spoke
almost
in
the
plural
,
like
a
king
speaking
.
I
wish
I
could
put
*NL*
down
all
he
said
exactly
as
he
said
it
,
for
to
me
it
was
most
*NL*
fascinating
.
It
seemed
to
have
in
it
a
whole
history
of
the
country
.
He
*NL*
grew
excited
as
he
spoke
,
and
walked
about
the
room
pulling
his
great
*NL*
white
moustache
and
grasping
anything
on
which
he
laid
his
hands
as
*NL*
though
he
would
crush
it
by
main
strength
.
One
thing
he
said
which
I
*NL*
shall
put
down
as
nearly
as
I
can
;
for
it
tells
in
its
way
the
story
of
*NL*
his
race
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
Szekelys
have
a
right
to
be
proud
,
for
in
our
veins
flows
the
blood
*NL*
of
many
brave
races
who
fought
as
the
lion
fights
,
for
lordship
.
Here
,
*NL*
in
the
whirlpool
of
European
races
,
the
Ugric
tribe
bore
down
from
*NL*
Iceland
the
fighting
spirit
which
Thor
and
Wodin
gave
them
,
which
their
*NL*
Berserkers
displayed
to
such
fell
intent
on
the
seaboards
of
Europe
,
ay
,
*NL*
and
of
Asia
and
Africa
too
,
till
the
peoples
thought
that
the
*NL*
were-wolves
themselves
had
come
.
Here
,
too
,
when
they
came
,
they
found
*NL*
the
Huns
,
whose
warlike
fury
had
swept
the
earth
like
a
living
flame
,
*NL*
till
the
dying
peoples
held
that
in
their
veins
ran
the
blood
of
those
*NL*
old
witches
,
who
,
expelled
from
Scythia
had
mated
with
the
devils
in
the
*NL*
desert
.
Fools
,
fools
!
What
devil
or
what
witch
was
ever
so
great
as
*NL*
Attila
,
whose
blood
is
in
these
veins
?
''
He
held
up
his
arms
.
``
Is
it
a
*NL*
wonder
that
we
were
a
conquering
race
;
that
we
were
proud
;
that
when
the
*NL*
Magyar
,
the
Lombard
,
the
Avar
,
the
Bulgar
,
or
the
Turk
poured
his
*NL*
thousands
on
our
frontiers
,
we
drove
them
back
?
Is
it
strange
that
when
*NL*
Arpad
and
his
legions
swept
through
the
Hungarian
fatherland
he
found
us
*NL*
here
when
he
reached
the
frontier
;
that
the
Honfoglalas
was
completed
*NL*
there
?
And
when
the
Hungarian
flood
swept
eastward
,
the
Szekelys
were
*NL*
claimed
as
kindred
by
the
victorious
Magyars
,
and
to
us
for
centuries
*NL*
was
trusted
the
guarding
of
the
frontier
of
Turkey-land
;
ay
,
and
more
*NL*
than
that
,
endless
duty
of
the
frontier
guard
,
for
,
as
the
Turks
say
,
*NL*
`
water
sleeps
,
and
enemy
is
sleepless
.
'
Who
more
gladly
than
we
*NL*
throughout
the
Four
Nations
received
the
`
bloody
sword
,
'
or
at
its
*NL*
warlike
call
flocked
quicker
to
the
standard
of
the
King
?
When
was
*NL*
redeemed
that
great
shame
of
my
nation
,
the
shame
of
Cassova
,
when
the
*NL*
flags
of
the
Wallach
and
the
Magyar
went
down
beneath
the
Crescent
?
Who
*NL*
was
it
but
one
of
my
own
race
who
as
Voivode
crossed
the
Danube
and
beat
*NL*
the
Turk
on
his
own
ground
?
This
was
a
Dracula
indeed
!
Woe
was
it
that
*NL*
his
own
unworthy
brother
,
when
he
had
fallen
,
sold
his
people
to
the
*NL*
Turk
and
brought
the
shame
of
slavery
on
them
!
Was
it
not
this
Dracula
,
*NL*
indeed
,
who
inspired
that
other
of
his
race
who
in
a
later
age
again
and
*NL*
again
brought
his
forces
over
the
great
river
into
Turkey-land
;
who
,
*NL*
when
he
was
beaten
back
,
came
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
,
though
he
had
*NL*
to
come
alone
from
the
bloody
field
where
his
troops
were
being
*NL*
slaughtered
,
since
he
knew
that
he
alone
could
ultimately
triumph
!
They
*NL*
said
that
he
thought
only
of
himself
.
Bah
!
what
good
are
peasants
*NL*
without
a
leader
?
Where
ends
the
war
without
a
brain
and
heart
to
*NL*
conduct
it
?
Again
,
when
,
after
the
battle
of
Mohacs
,
we
threw
off
the
*NL*
Hungarian
yoke
,
we
of
the
Dracula
blood
were
amongst
their
leaders
,
for
*NL*
our
spirit
would
not
brook
that
we
were
not
free
.
Ah
,
young
sir
,
the
*NL*
Szekelys
--
and
the
Dracula
as
their
heart
's
blood
,
their
brains
,
and
*NL*
their
swords
--
can
boast
a
record
that
mushroom
growths
like
the
*NL*
Hapsburgs
and
the
Romanoffs
can
never
reach
.
The
warlike
days
are
over
.
*NL*
Blood
is
too
precious
a
thing
in
these
days
of
dishonourable
peace
;
and
*NL*
the
glories
of
the
great
races
are
as
a
tale
that
is
told
.

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
by
this
time
close
on
morning
,
and
we
went
to
bed
.
-LRB-

,
this
*NL*
diary
seems
horribly
like
the
beginning
of
the
``
Arabian
Nights
,

for
*NL*
everything
has
to
break
off
at

_
12
May

_
--
Let
me
begin
with
facts
--
bare
,
meagre
facts
,
verified
by
*NL*
books
and
figures
,
and
of
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
.
I
must
not
*NL*
confuse
them
with
experiences
which
will
have
to
rest
on
my
own
*NL*
observation
,
or
my
memory
of
them
.
Last
evening
when
the
Count
came
from
*NL*
his
room
he
began
by
asking
me
questions
on
legal
matters
and
on
the
*NL*
doing
of
certain
kinds
of
business
.
I
had
spent
the
day
wearily
over
*NL*
books
,
and
,
simply
to
keep
my
mind
occupied
,
went
over
some
of
the
*NL*
matters
I
had
been
examined
in
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
There
was
a
certain
*NL*
method
in
the
Count
's
inquiries
,
so
I
shall
try
to
put
them
down
in
*NL*
sequence
;
the
knowledge
may
somehow
or
some
time
be
useful
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
he
asked
if
a
man
in
England
might
have
two
solicitors
or
more
.
I
*NL*
told
him
he
might
have
a
dozen
if
he
wished
,
but
that
it
would
not
be
*NL*
wise
to
have
more
than
one
solicitor
engaged
in
one
transaction
,
as
only
*NL*
one
could
act
at
a
time
,
and
that
to
change
would
be
certain
to
militate
*NL*
against
his
interest
.
He
seemed
thoroughly
to
understand
,
and
went
on
to
*NL*
ask
if
there
would
be
any
practical
difficulty
in
having
one
man
to
*NL*
attend
,
say
,
to
banking
,
and
another
to
look
after
shipping
,
in
case
*NL*
local
help
were
needed
in
a
place
far
from
the
home
of
the
banking
*NL*
solicitor
.
I
asked
him
to
explain
more
fully
,
so
that
I
might
not
by
any
*NL*
chance
mislead
him
,
so
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
illustrate
.
Your
friend
and
mine
,
Mr.
Peter
Hawkins
,
from
under
*NL*
the
shadow
of
your
beautiful
cathedral
at
Exeter
,
which
is
far
from
*NL*
London
,
buys
for
me
through
your
good
self
my
place
at
London
.
Good
!
Now
*NL*
here
let
me
say
frankly
,
lest
you
should
think
it
strange
that
I
have
*NL*
sought
the
services
of
one
so
far
off
from
London
instead
of
some
one
*NL*
resident
there
,
that
my
motive
was
that
no
local
interest
might
be
*NL*
served
save
my
wish
only
;
and
as
one
of
London
residence
might
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
have
some
purpose
of
himself
or
friend
to
serve
,
I
went
thus
afield
to
*NL*
seek
my
agent
,
whose
labours
should
be
only
to
my
interest
.
Now
,
suppose
*NL*
I
,
who
have
much
of
affairs
,
wish
to
ship
goods
,
say
,
to
Newcastle
,
or
*NL*
Durham
,
or
Harwich
,
or
Dover
,
might
it
not
be
that
it
could
with
more
*NL*
ease
be
done
by
consigning
to
one
in
these
ports
?
''
I
answered
that
*NL*
certainly
it
would
be
most
easy
,
but
that
we
solicitors
had
a
system
of
*NL*
agency
one
for
the
other
,
so
that
local
work
could
be
done
locally
on
*NL*
instruction
from
any
solicitor
,
so
that
the
client
,
simply
placing
*NL*
himself
in
the
hands
of
one
man
,
could
have
his
wishes
carried
out
by
*NL*
him
without
further
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
could
be
at
liberty
to
direct
myself
.
Is
it
not
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
I
replied
;
and
``
such
is
often
done
by
men
of
business
,
who
*NL*
do
not
like
the
whole
of
their
affairs
to
be
known
by
any
one
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
he
said
,
and
then
went
on
to
ask
about
the
means
of
making
*NL*
consignments
and
the
forms
to
be
gone
through
,
and
of
all
sorts
of
*NL*
difficulties
which
might
arise
,
but
by
forethought
could
be
guarded
*NL*
against
.
I
explained
all
these
things
to
him
to
the
best
of
my
ability
,
*NL*
and
he
certainly
left
me
under
the
impression
that
he
would
have
made
a
*NL*
wonderful
solicitor
,
for
there
was
nothing
that
he
did
not
think
of
or
*NL*
foresee
.
For
a
man
who
was
never
in
the
country
,
and
who
did
not
*NL*
evidently
do
much
in
the
way
of
business
,
his
knowledge
and
acumen
were
*NL*
wonderful
.
When
he
had
satisfied
himself
on
these
points
of
which
he
had
*NL*
spoken
,
and
I
had
verified
all
as
well
as
I
could
by
the
books
*NL*
available
,
he
suddenly
stood
up
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
written
since
your
first
letter
to
our
friend
Mr.
Peter
*NL*
Hawkins
,
or
to
any
other
?
''
It
was
with
some
bitterness
in
my
heart
that
*NL*
I
answered
that
I
had
not
,
that
as
yet
I
had
not
seen
any
opportunity
of
*NL*
sending
letters
to
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
write
now
,
my
young
friend
,
''
he
said
,
laying
a
heavy
hand
on
my
*NL*
shoulder
:
``
write
to
our
friend
and
to
any
other
;
and
say
,
if
it
will
*NL*
please
you
,
that
you
shall
stay
with
me
until
a
month
from
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
me
to
stay
so
long
?
''
I
asked
,
for
my
heart
grew
cold
at
the
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
desire
it
much
;
nay
,
I
will
take
no
refusal
.
When
your
master
,
*NL*
employer
,
what
you
will
,
engaged
that
someone
should
come
on
his
behalf
,
*NL*
it
was
understood
that
my
needs
only
were
to
be
consulted
.
I
have
not
*NL*
stinted
.
Is
it
not
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
I
do
but
bow
acceptance
?
It
was
Mr.
Hawkins
's
interest
,
not
*NL*
mine
,
and
I
had
to
think
of
him
,
not
myself
;
and
besides
,
while
Count
*NL*
Dracula
was
speaking
,
there
was
that
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
bearing
*NL*
which
made
me
remember
that
I
was
a
prisoner
,
and
that
if
I
wished
it
I
*NL*
could
have
no
choice
.
The
Count
saw
his
victory
in
my
bow
,
and
his
*NL*
mastery
in
the
trouble
of
my
face
,
for
he
began
at
once
to
use
them
,
but
*NL*
in
his
own
smooth
,
resistless
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pray
you
,
my
good
young
friend
,
that
you
will
not
discourse
of
things
*NL*
other
than
business
in
your
letters
.
It
will
doubtless
please
your
*NL*
friends
to
know
that
you
are
well
,
and
that
you
look
forward
to
getting
*NL*
home
to
them
.
Is
it
not
so
?
''
As
he
spoke
he
handed
me
three
sheets
of
*NL*
note-paper
and
three
envelopes
.
They
were
all
of
the
thinnest
foreign
*NL*
post
,
and
looking
at
them
,
then
at
him
,
and
noticing
his
quiet
smile
,
*NL*
with
the
sharp
,
canine
teeth
lying
over
the
red
underlip
,
I
understood
*NL*
as
well
as
if
he
had
spoken
that
I
should
be
careful
what
I
wrote
,
for
*NL*
he
would
be
able
to
read
it
.
So
I
determined
to
write
only
formal
notes
*NL*
now
,
but
to
write
fully
to
Mr.
Hawkins
in
secret
,
and
also
to
Mina
,
for
*NL*
to
her
I
could
write
in
shorthand
,
which
would
puzzle
the
Count
,
if
he
*NL*
did
see
it
.
When
I
had
written
my
two
letters
I
sat
quiet
,
reading
a
*NL*
book
whilst
the
Count
wrote
several
notes
,
referring
as
he
wrote
them
to
*NL*
some
books
on
his
table
.
Then
he
took
up
my
two
and
placed
them
with
his
*NL*
own
,
and
put
by
his
writing
materials
,
after
which
,
the
instant
the
door
*NL*
had
closed
behind
him
,
I
leaned
over
and
looked
at
the
letters
,
which
*NL*
were
face
down
on
the
table
.
I
felt
no
compunction
in
doing
so
,
for
*NL*
under
the
circumstances
I
felt
that
I
should
protect
myself
in
every
way
*NL*
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
letters
was
directed
to
Samuel
F.
Billington
,
No.
7
,
The
*NL*
Crescent
,
Whitby
,
another
to
Herr
Leutner
,
Varna
;
the
third
was
to
*NL*
Coutts
&
Co.
,
London
,
and
the
fourth
to
Herren
Klopstock
&
Billreuth
,
*NL*
bankers
,
Buda-Pesth
.
The
second
and
fourth
were
unsealed
.
I
was
just
*NL*
about
to
look
at
them
when
I
saw
the
door-handle
move
.
I
sank
back
in
my
*NL*
seat
,
having
just
had
time
to
replace
the
letters
as
they
had
been
and
*NL*
to
resume
my
book
before
the
Count
,
holding
still
another
letter
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
entered
the
room
.
He
took
up
the
letters
on
the
table
and
stamped
*NL*
them
carefully
,
and
then
turning
to
me
,
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
trust
you
will
forgive
me
,
but
I
have
much
work
to
do
in
private
this
*NL*
evening
.
You
will
,
I
hope
,
find
all
things
as
you
wish

''
At
the
door
he
*NL*
turned
,
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
advise
you
,
my
dear
young
friend
--
nay
,
let
me
warn
you
with
all
*NL*
seriousness
,
that
should
you
leave
these
rooms
you
will
not
by
any
*NL*
chance
go
to
sleep
in
any
other
part
of
the
castle
.
It
is
old
,
and
has
*NL*
many
memories
,
and
there
are
bad
dreams
for
those
who
sleep
unwisely
.
Be
*NL*
warned
!
Should
sleep
now
or
ever
overcome
you
,
or
be
like
to
do
,
then
*NL*
haste
to
your
own
chamber
or
to
these
rooms
,
for
your
rest
will
then
be
*NL*
safe
.
But
if
you
be
not
careful
in
this
respect
,
then
''
--
He
finished
his
*NL*
speech
in
a
gruesome
way
,
for
he
motioned
with
his
hands
as
if
he
were
*NL*
washing
them
.
I
quite
understood
;
my
only
doubt
was
as
to
whether
any
*NL*
dream
could
be
more
terrible
than
the
unnatural
,
horrible
net
of
gloom
*NL*
and
mystery
which
seemed
closing
around
me
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
_
Later
.
_
--
I
endorse
the
last
words
written
,
but
this
time
there
is
no
*NL*
doubt
in
question
.
I
shall
not
fear
to
sleep
in
any
place
where
he
is
*NL*
not
.
I
have
placed
the
crucifix
over
the
head
of
my
bed
--
I
imagine
that
*NL*
my
rest
is
thus
freer
from
dreams
;
and
there
it
shall
remain
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
left
me
I
went
to
my
room
.
After
a
little
while
,
not
hearing
any
*NL*
sound
,
I
came
out
and
went
up
the
stone
stair
to
where
I
could
look
out
*NL*
towards
the
South
.
There
was
some
sense
of
freedom
in
the
vast
expanse
,
*NL*
inaccessible
though
it
was
to
me
,
as
compared
with
the
narrow
darkness
*NL*
of
the
courtyard
.
Looking
out
on
this
,
I
felt
that
I
was
indeed
in
*NL*
prison
,
and
I
seemed
to
want
a
breath
of
fresh
air
,
though
it
were
of
*NL*
the
night
.
I
am
beginning
to
feel
this
nocturnal
existence
tell
on
me
.
*NL*
It
is
destroying
my
nerve
.
I
start
at
my
own
shadow
,
and
am
full
of
all
*NL*
sorts
of
horrible
imaginings
.
God
knows
that
there
is
ground
for
my
*NL*
terrible
fear
in
this
accursed
place
!
I
looked
out
over
the
beautiful
*NL*
expanse
,
bathed
in
soft
yellow
moonlight
till
it
was
almost
as
light
as
*NL*
day
.
In
the
soft
light
the
distant
hills
became
melted
,
and
the
shadows
*NL*
in
the
valleys
and
gorges
of
velvety
blackness
.
The
mere
beauty
seemed
*NL*
to
cheer
me
;
there
was
peace
and
comfort
in
every
breath
I
drew
.
As
I
*NL*
leaned
from
the
window
my
eye
was
caught
by
something
moving
a
storey
*NL*
below
me
,
and
somewhat
to
my
left
,
where
I
imagined
,
from
the
order
of
*NL*
the
rooms
,
that
the
windows
of
the
Count
's
own
room
would
look
out
.
The
*NL*
window
at
which
I
stood
was
tall
and
deep
,
stone-mullioned
,
and
though
*NL*
weatherworn
,
was
still
complete
;
but
it
was
evidently
many
a
day
since
*NL*
the
case
had
been
there
.
I
drew
back
behind
the
stonework
,
and
looked
*NL*
carefully
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
saw
was
the
Count
's
head
coming
out
from
the
window
.
I
did
not
*NL*
see
the
face
,
but
I
knew
the
man
by
the
neck
and
the
movement
of
his
*NL*
back
and
arms
.
In
any
case
I
could
not
mistake
the
hands
which
I
had
had
*NL*
so
many
opportunities
of
studying
.
I
was
at
first
interested
and
*NL*
somewhat
amused
,
for
it
is
wonderful
how
small
a
matter
will
interest
*NL*
and
amuse
a
man
when
he
is
a
prisoner
.
But
my
very
feelings
changed
to
*NL*
repulsion
and
terror
when
I
saw
the
whole
man
slowly
emerge
from
the
*NL*
window
and
begin
to
crawl
down
the
castle
wall
over
that
dreadful
abyss
,
*NL*
_
face
down
_
with
his
cloak
spreading
out
around
him
like
great
wings
.
At
*NL*
first
I
could
not
believe
my
eyes
.
I
thought
it
was
some
trick
of
the
*NL*
moonlight
,
some
weird
effect
of
shadow
;
but
I
kept
looking
,
and
it
could
*NL*
be
no
delusion
.
I
saw
the
fingers
and
toes
grasp
the
corners
of
the
*NL*
stones
,
worn
clear
of
the
mortar
by
the
stress
of
years
,
and
by
thus
*NL*
using
every
projection
and
inequality
move
downwards
with
considerable
*NL*
speed
,
just
as
a
lizard
moves
along
a
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
manner
of
man
is
this
,
or
what
manner
of
creature
is
it
in
the
*NL*
semblance
of
man
?
I
feel
the
dread
of
this
horrible
place
overpowering
*NL*
me
;
I
am
in
fear
--
in
awful
fear
--
and
there
is
no
escape
for
me
;
I
am
*NL*
encompassed
about
with
terrors
that
I
dare
not
think
of
...
*NL*

_
15
May
.
_
--
Once
more
have
I
seen
the
Count
go
out
in
his
lizard
fashion
.
*NL*
He
moved
downwards
in
a
sidelong
way
,
some
hundred
feet
down
,
and
a
good
*NL*
deal
to
the
left
.
He
vanished
into
some
hole
or
window
.
When
his
head
*NL*
had
disappeared
,
I
leaned
out
to
try
and
see
more
,
but
without
*NL*
avail
--
the
distance
was
too
great
to
allow
a
proper
angle
of
sight
.
I
*NL*
knew
he
had
left
the
castle
now
,
and
thought
to
use
the
opportunity
to
*NL*
explore
more
than
I
had
dared
to
do
as
yet
.
I
went
back
to
the
room
,
and
*NL*
taking
a
lamp
,
tried
all
the
doors
.
They
were
all
locked
,
as
I
had
*NL*
expected
,
and
the
locks
were
comparatively
new
;
but
I
went
down
the
*NL*
stone
stairs
to
the
hall
where
I
had
entered
originally
.
I
found
I
could
*NL*
pull
back
the
bolts
easily
enough
and
unhook
the
great
chains
;
but
the
*NL*
door
was
locked
,
and
the
key
was
gone
!
That
key
must
be
in
the
Count
's
*NL*
room
;
I
must
watch
should
his
door
be
unlocked
,
so
that
I
may
get
it
and
*NL*
escape
.
I
went
on
to
make
a
thorough
examination
of
the
various
stairs
*NL*
and
passages
,
and
to
try
the
doors
that
opened
from
them
.
One
or
two
*NL*
small
rooms
near
the
hall
were
open
,
but
there
was
nothing
to
see
in
*NL*
them
except
old
furniture
,
dusty
with
age
and
moth-eaten
.
At
last
,
*NL*
however
,
I
found
one
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairway
which
,
though
it
*NL*
seemed
to
be
locked
,
gave
a
little
under
pressure
.
I
tried
it
harder
,
*NL*
and
found
that
it
was
not
really
locked
,
but
that
the
resistance
came
*NL*
from
the
fact
that
the
hinges
had
fallen
somewhat
,
and
the
heavy
door
*NL*
rested
on
the
floor
.
Here
was
an
opportunity
which
I
might
not
have
*NL*
again
,
so
I
exerted
myself
,
and
with
many
efforts
forced
it
back
so
that
*NL*
I
could
enter
.
I
was
now
in
a
wing
of
the
castle
further
to
the
right
*NL*
than
the
rooms
I
knew
and
a
storey
lower
down
.
From
the
windows
I
could
*NL*
see
that
the
suite
of
rooms
lay
along
to
the
south
of
the
castle
,
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
end
room
looking
out
both
west
and
south
.
On
the
latter
*NL*
side
,
as
well
as
to
the
former
,
there
was
a
great
precipice
.
The
castle
*NL*
was
built
on
the
corner
of
a
great
rock
,
so
that
on
three
sides
it
was
*NL*
quite
impregnable
,
and
great
windows
were
placed
here
where
sling
,
or
*NL*
bow
,
or
culverin
could
not
reach
,
and
consequently
light
and
comfort
,
*NL*
impossible
to
a
position
which
had
to
be
guarded
,
were
secured
.
To
the
*NL*
west
was
a
great
valley
,
and
then
,
rising
far
away
,
great
jagged
*NL*
mountain
fastnesses
,
rising
peak
on
peak
,
the
sheer
rock
studded
with
*NL*
mountain
ash
and
thorn
,
whose
roots
clung
in
cracks
and
crevices
and
*NL*
crannies
of
the
stone
.
This
was
evidently
the
portion
of
the
castle
*NL*
occupied
by
the
ladies
in
bygone
days
,
for
the
furniture
had
more
air
of
*NL*
comfort
than
any
I
had
seen
.
The
windows
were
curtainless
,
and
the
*NL*
yellow
moonlight
,
flooding
in
through
the
diamond
panes
,
enabled
one
to
*NL*
see
even
colours
,
whilst
it
softened
the
wealth
of
dust
which
lay
over
*NL*
all
and
disguised
in
some
measure
the
ravages
of
time
and
the
moth
.
My
*NL*
lamp
seemed
to
be
of
little
effect
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
,
but
I
was
*NL*
glad
to
have
it
with
me
,
for
there
was
a
dread
loneliness
in
the
place
*NL*
which
chilled
my
heart
and
made
my
nerves
tremble
.
Still
,
it
was
better
*NL*
than
living
alone
in
the
rooms
which
I
had
come
to
hate
from
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
Count
,
and
after
trying
a
little
to
school
my
nerves
,
I
*NL*
found
a
soft
quietude
come
over
me
.
Here
I
am
,
sitting
at
a
little
oak
*NL*
table
where
in
old
times
possibly
some
fair
lady
sat
to
pen
,
with
much
*NL*
thought
and
many
blushes
,
her
ill-spelt
love-letter
,
and
writing
in
my
*NL*
diary
in
shorthand
all
that
has
happened
since
I
closed
it
last
.
It
is
*NL*
nineteenth
century
up-to-date
with
a
vengeance
.
And
yet
,
unless
my
*NL*
senses
deceive
me
,
the
old
centuries
had
,
and
have
,
powers
of
their
own
*NL*
which
mere
``
modernity
''
can
not
kill
.

_
Later
:
the
Morning
of
16
May
.
_
--
God
preserve
my
sanity
,
for
to
this
I
*NL*
am
reduced
.
Safety
and
the
assurance
of
safety
are
things
of
the
past
.
*NL*
Whilst
I
live
on
here
there
is
but
one
thing
to
hope
for
,
that
I
may
not
*NL*
go
mad
,
if
,
indeed
,
I
be
not
mad
already
.
If
I
be
sane
,
then
surely
it
*NL*
is
maddening
to
think
that
of
all
the
foul
things
that
lurk
in
this
*NL*
hateful
place
the
Count
is
the
least
dreadful
to
me
;
that
to
him
alone
I
*NL*
can
look
for
safety
,
even
though
this
be
only
whilst
I
can
serve
his
*NL*
purpose
.
Great
God
!
merciful
God
!
Let
me
be
calm
,
for
out
of
that
way
*NL*
lies
madness
indeed
.
I
begin
to
get
new
lights
on
certain
things
which
*NL*
have
puzzled
me
.
Up
to
now
I
never
quite
knew
what
Shakespeare
meant
*NL*
when
he
made
Hamlet
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
tablets
!
quick
,
my
tablets
!
*NL*
'T
is
meet
that
I
put
it
down
,
''
etc.
,
*NL*
*NL*
for
now
,
feeling
as
though
my
own
brain
were
unhinged
or
as
if
the
shock
*NL*
had
come
which
must
end
in
its
undoing
,
I
turn
to
my
diary
for
repose
.
*NL*
The
habit
of
entering
accurately
must
help
to
soothe
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
's
mysterious
warning
frightened
me
at
the
time
;
it
frightens
*NL*
me
more
now
when
I
think
of
it
,
for
in
future
he
has
a
fearful
hold
upon
*NL*
me
.
I
shall
fear
to
doubt
what
he
may
say
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
written
in
my
diary
and
had
fortunately
replaced
the
book
and
*NL*
pen
in
my
pocket
I
felt
sleepy
.
The
Count
's
warning
came
into
my
mind
,
*NL*
but
I
took
a
pleasure
in
disobeying
it
.
The
sense
of
sleep
was
upon
me
,
*NL*
and
with
it
the
obstinacy
which
sleep
brings
as
outrider
.
The
soft
*NL*
moonlight
soothed
,
and
the
wide
expanse
without
gave
a
sense
of
freedom
*NL*
which
refreshed
me
.
I
determined
not
to
return
to-night
to
the
*NL*
gloom-haunted
rooms
,
but
to
sleep
here
,
where
,
of
old
,
ladies
had
sat
*NL*
and
sung
and
lived
sweet
lives
whilst
their
gentle
breasts
were
sad
for
*NL*
their
menfolk
away
in
the
midst
of
remorseless
wars
.
I
drew
a
great
*NL*
couch
out
of
its
place
near
the
corner
,
so
that
as
I
lay
,
I
could
look
*NL*
at
the
lovely
view
to
east
and
south
,
and
unthinking
of
and
uncaring
for
*NL*
the
dust
,
composed
myself
for
sleep
.
I
suppose
I
must
have
fallen
*NL*
asleep
;
I
hope
so
,
but
I
fear
,
for
all
that
followed
was
startlingly
*NL*
real
--
so
real
that
now
sitting
here
in
the
broad
,
full
sunlight
of
the
*NL*
morning
,
I
can
not
in
the
least
believe
that
it
was
all
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
alone
.
The
room
was
the
same
,
unchanged
in
any
way
since
I
*NL*
came
into
it
;
I
could
see
along
the
floor
,
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
,
*NL*
my
own
footsteps
marked
where
I
had
disturbed
the
long
accumulation
of
*NL*
dust
.
In
the
moonlight
opposite
me
were
three
young
women
,
ladies
by
*NL*
their
dress
and
manner
.
I
thought
at
the
time
that
I
must
be
dreaming
*NL*
when
I
saw
them
,
for
,
though
the
moonlight
was
behind
them
,
they
threw
*NL*
no
shadow
on
the
floor
.
They
came
close
to
me
,
and
looked
at
me
for
some
*NL*
time
,
and
then
whispered
together
.
Two
were
dark
,
and
had
high
aquiline
*NL*
noses
,
like
the
Count
,
and
great
dark
,
piercing
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
*NL*
almost
red
when
contrasted
with
the
pale
yellow
moon
.
The
other
was
*NL*
fair
,
as
fair
as
can
be
,
with
great
wavy
masses
of
golden
hair
and
eyes
*NL*
like
pale
sapphires
.
I
seemed
somehow
to
know
her
face
,
and
to
know
it
*NL*
in
connection
with
some
dreamy
fear
,
but
I
could
not
recollect
at
the
*NL*
moment
how
or
where
.
All
three
had
brilliant
white
teeth
that
shone
like
*NL*
pearls
against
the
ruby
of
their
voluptuous
lips
.
There
was
something
*NL*
about
them
that
made
me
uneasy
,
some
longing
and
at
the
same
time
some
*NL*
deadly
fear
.
I
felt
in
my
heart
a
wicked
,
burning
desire
that
they
would
*NL*
kiss
me
with
those
red
lips
.
It
is
not
good
to
note
this
down
,
lest
some
*NL*
day
it
should
meet
Mina
's
eyes
and
cause
her
pain
;
but
it
is
the
truth
.
*NL*
They
whispered
together
,
and
then
they
all
three
laughed
--
such
a
*NL*
silvery
,
musical
laugh
,
but
as
hard
as
though
the
sound
never
could
have
*NL*
come
through
the
softness
of
human
lips
.
It
was
like
the
intolerable
,
*NL*
tingling
sweetness
of
water-glasses
when
played
on
by
a
cunning
hand
.
*NL*
The
fair
girl
shook
her
head
coquettishly
,
and
the
other
two
urged
her
*NL*
on
.
One
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
You
are
first
,
and
we
shall
follow
;
yours
is
the
right
to
*NL*
begin
.
''
The
other
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
young
and
strong
;
there
are
kisses
for
us
all
.
''
I
lay
quiet
,
*NL*
looking
out
under
my
eyelashes
in
an
agony
of
delightful
anticipation
.
*NL*
The
fair
girl
advanced
and
bent
over
me
till
I
could
feel
the
movement
*NL*
of
her
breath
upon
me
.
Sweet
it
was
in
one
sense
,
honey-sweet
,
and
sent
*NL*
the
same
tingling
through
the
nerves
as
her
voice
,
but
with
a
bitter
*NL*
underlying
the
sweet
,
a
bitter
offensiveness
,
as
one
smells
in
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
afraid
to
raise
my
eyelids
,
but
looked
out
and
saw
perfectly
under
*NL*
the
lashes
.
The
girl
went
on
her
knees
,
and
bent
over
me
,
simply
*NL*
gloating
.
There
was
a
deliberate
voluptuousness
which
was
both
thrilling
*NL*
and
repulsive
,
and
as
she
arched
her
neck
she
actually
licked
her
lips
*NL*
like
an
animal
,
till
I
could
see
in
the
moonlight
the
moisture
shining
*NL*
on
the
scarlet
lips
and
on
the
red
tongue
as
it
lapped
the
white
sharp
*NL*
teeth
.
Lower
and
lower
went
her
head
as
the
lips
went
below
the
range
of
*NL*
my
mouth
and
chin
and
seemed
about
to
fasten
on
my
throat
.
Then
she
*NL*
paused
,
and
I
could
hear
the
churning
sound
of
her
tongue
as
it
licked
*NL*
her
teeth
and
lips
,
and
could
feel
the
hot
breath
on
my
neck
.
Then
the
*NL*
skin
of
my
throat
began
to
tingle
as
one
's
flesh
does
when
the
hand
that
*NL*
is
to
tickle
it
approaches
nearer
--
nearer
.
I
could
feel
the
soft
,
*NL*
shivering
touch
of
the
lips
on
the
super-sensitive
skin
of
my
throat
,
*NL*
and
the
hard
dents
of
two
sharp
teeth
,
just
touching
and
pausing
there
.
*NL*
I
closed
my
eyes
in
a
languorous
ecstasy
and
waited
--
waited
with
beating
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
instant
,
another
sensation
swept
through
me
as
quick
as
*NL*
lightning
.
I
was
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
Count
,
and
of
his
*NL*
being
as
if
lapped
in
a
storm
of
fury
.
As
my
eyes
opened
involuntarily
I
*NL*
saw
his
strong
hand
grasp
the
slender
neck
of
the
fair
woman
and
with
*NL*
giant
's
power
draw
it
back
,
the
blue
eyes
transformed
with
fury
,
the
*NL*
white
teeth
champing
with
rage
,
and
the
fair
cheeks
blazing
red
with
*NL*
passion
.
But
the
Count
!
Never
did
I
imagine
such
wrath
and
fury
,
even
to
*NL*
the
demons
of
the
pit
.
His
eyes
were
positively
blazing
.
The
red
light
*NL*
in
them
was
lurid
,
as
if
the
flames
of
hell-fire
blazed
behind
them
.
His
*NL*
face
was
deathly
pale
,
and
the
lines
of
it
were
hard
like
drawn
wires
;
*NL*
the
thick
eyebrows
that
met
over
the
nose
now
seemed
like
a
heaving
bar
*NL*
of
white-hot
metal
.
With
a
fierce
sweep
of
his
arm
,
he
hurled
the
woman
*NL*
from
him
,
and
then
motioned
to
the
others
,
as
though
he
were
beating
*NL*
them
back
;
it
was
the
same
imperious
gesture
that
I
had
seen
used
to
the
*NL*
wolves
.
In
a
voice
which
,
though
low
and
almost
in
a
whisper
seemed
to
*NL*
cut
through
the
air
and
then
ring
round
the
room
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
touch
him
,
any
of
you
?
How
dare
you
cast
eyes
on
him
when
*NL*
I
had
forbidden
it
?
Back
,
I
tell
you
all
!
This
man
belongs
to
me
!
Beware
*NL*
how
you
meddle
with
him
,
or
you
'll
have
to
deal
with
me
.
''
The
fair
girl
,
*NL*
with
a
laugh
of
ribald
coquetry
,
turned
to
answer
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
yourself
never
loved
;
you
never
love
!
''
On
this
the
other
women
*NL*
joined
,
and
such
a
mirthless
,
hard
,
soulless
laughter
rang
through
the
*NL*
room
that
it
almost
made
me
faint
to
hear
;
it
seemed
like
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
fiends
.
Then
the
Count
turned
,
after
looking
at
my
face
attentively
,
*NL*
and
said
in
a
soft
whisper
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
too
can
love
;
you
yourselves
can
tell
it
from
the
past
.
Is
it
*NL*
not
so
?
Well
,
now
I
promise
you
that
when
I
am
done
with
him
you
shall
*NL*
kiss
him
at
your
will
.
Now
go
!
go
!
I
must
awaken
him
,
for
there
is
work
*NL*
to
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
to
have
nothing
to-night
?
''
said
one
of
them
,
with
a
low
laugh
,
*NL*
as
she
pointed
to
the
bag
which
he
had
thrown
upon
the
floor
,
and
which
*NL*
moved
as
though
there
were
some
living
thing
within
it
.
For
answer
he
*NL*
nodded
his
head
.
One
of
the
women
jumped
forward
and
opened
it
.
If
my
*NL*
ears
did
not
deceive
me
there
was
a
gasp
and
a
low
wail
,
as
of
a
*NL*
half-smothered
child
.
The
women
closed
round
,
whilst
I
was
aghast
with
*NL*
horror
;
but
as
I
looked
they
disappeared
,
and
with
them
the
dreadful
*NL*
bag
.
There
was
no
door
near
them
,
and
they
could
not
have
passed
me
*NL*
without
my
noticing
.
They
simply
seemed
to
fade
into
the
rays
of
the
*NL*
moonlight
and
pass
out
through
the
window
,
for
I
could
see
outside
the
*NL*
dim
,
shadowy
forms
for
a
moment
before
they
entirely
faded
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
horror
overcame
me
,
and
I
sank
down
unconscious
.

JONATHAN
HARKER
'S
JOURNAL
--
_
continued
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
awoke
in
my
own
bed
.
If
it
be
that
I
had
not
dreamt
,
the
Count
must
*NL*
have
carried
me
here
.
I
tried
to
satisfy
myself
on
the
subject
,
but
*NL*
could
not
arrive
at
any
unquestionable
result
.
To
be
sure
,
there
were
*NL*
certain
small
evidences
,
such
as
that
my
clothes
were
folded
and
laid
by
*NL*
in
a
manner
which
was
not
my
habit
.
My
watch
was
still
unwound
,
and
I
am
*NL*
rigorously
accustomed
to
wind
it
the
last
thing
before
going
to
bed
,
and
*NL*
many
such
details
.
But
these
things
are
no
proof
,
for
they
may
have
been
*NL*
evidences
that
my
mind
was
not
as
usual
,
and
,
from
some
cause
or
*NL*
another
,
I
had
certainly
been
much
upset
.
I
must
watch
for
proof
.
Of
one
*NL*
thing
I
am
glad
:
if
it
was
that
the
Count
carried
me
here
and
undressed
*NL*
me
,
he
must
have
been
hurried
in
his
task
,
for
my
pockets
are
intact
.
I
*NL*
am
sure
this
diary
would
have
been
a
mystery
to
him
which
he
would
not
*NL*
have
brooked
.
He
would
have
taken
or
destroyed
it
.
As
I
look
round
this
*NL*
room
,
although
it
has
been
to
me
so
full
of
fear
,
it
is
now
a
sort
of
*NL*
sanctuary
,
for
nothing
can
be
more
dreadful
than
those
awful
women
,
who
*NL*
were
--
who
_
are
_
--
waiting
to
suck
my
blood
.

_
--
I
have
been
down
to
look
at
that
room
again
in
daylight
,
for
*NL*
I
_
must
_
know
the
truth
.
When
I
got
to
the
doorway
at
the
top
of
the
*NL*
stairs
I
found
it
closed
.
It
had
been
so
forcibly
driven
against
the
*NL*
jamb
that
part
of
the
woodwork
was
splintered
.
I
could
see
that
the
bolt
*NL*
of
the
lock
had
not
been
shot
,
but
the
door
is
fastened
from
the
inside
.
*NL*
I
fear
it
was
no
dream
,
and
must
act
on
this
surmise
.

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
_

May
.
_
--
I
am
surely
in
the
toils
.
Last
night
the
Count
asked
me
in
*NL*
the
suavest
tones
to
write
three
letters
,
one
saying
that
my
work
here
*NL*
was
nearly
done
,
and
that
I
should
start
for
home
within
a
few
days
,
*NL*
another
that
I
was
starting
on
the
next
morning
from
the
time
of
the
*NL*
letter
,
and
the
third
that
I
had
left
the
castle
and
arrived
at
*NL*
Bistritz
.
I
would
fain
have
rebelled
,
but
felt
that
in
the
present
state
*NL*
of
things
it
would
be
madness
to
quarrel
openly
with
the
Count
whilst
I
*NL*
am
so
absolutely
in
his
power
;
and
to
refuse
would
be
to
excite
his
*NL*
suspicion
and
to
arouse
his
anger
.
He
knows
that
I
know
too
much
,
and
*NL*
that
I
must
not
live
,
lest
I
be
dangerous
to
him
;
my
only
chance
is
to
*NL*
prolong
my
opportunities
.
Something
may
occur
which
will
give
me
a
*NL*
chance
to
escape
.
I
saw
in
his
eyes
something
of
that
gathering
wrath
*NL*
which
was
manifest
when
he
hurled
that
fair
woman
from
him
.
He
explained
*NL*
to
me
that
posts
were
few
and
uncertain
,
and
that
my
writing
now
would
*NL*
ensure
ease
of
mind
to
my
friends
;
and
he
assured
me
with
so
much
*NL*
impressiveness
that
he
would
countermand
the
later
letters
,
which
would
*NL*
be
held
over
at
Bistritz
until
due
time
in
case
chance
would
admit
of
my
*NL*
prolonging
my
stay
,
that
to
oppose
him
would
have
been
to
create
new
*NL*
suspicion
.
I
therefore
pretended
to
fall
in
with
his
views
,
and
asked
*NL*
him
what
dates
I
should
put
on
the
letters
.
He
calculated
a
minute
,
and
*NL*
then
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
should
be
June
12
,
the
second
June
19
,
and
the
third
June
*NL*
29
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
now
the
span
of
my
life
.
God
help
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
*

*NL*
*NL*
_
28
May

_
--
There
is
a
chance
of
escape
,
or
at
any
rate
of
being
able
to
*NL*
send
word
home
.
A
band
of
Szgany
have
come
to
the
castle
,
and
are
*NL*
encamped
in
the
courtyard
.
These
Szgany
are
gipsies
;
I
have
notes
of
*NL*
them
in
my
book
.
They
are
peculiar
to
this
part
of
the
world
,
though
*NL*
allied
to
the
ordinary
gipsies
all
the
world
over
.
There
are
thousands
*NL*
of
them
in
Hungary
and
Transylvania
,
who
are
almost
outside
all
law
.
*NL*
They
attach
themselves
as
a
rule
to
some
great
noble
or
_
boyar
_
,
and
*NL*
call
themselves
by
his
name
.
They
are
fearless
and
without
religion
,
*NL*
save
superstition
,
and
they
talk
only
their
own
varieties
of
the
Romany
*NL*
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
write
some
letters
home
,
and
shall
try
to
get
them
to
have
them
*NL*
posted
.
I
have
already
spoken
them
through
my
window
to
begin
*NL*
acquaintanceship
.
They
took
their
hats
off
and
made
obeisance
and
many
*NL*
signs
,
which
,
however
,
I
could
not
understand
any
more
than
I
could
*NL*
their
spoken
language
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
written
the
letters
.
Mina
's
is
in
shorthand
,
and
I
simply
ask
Mr.
*NL*
Hawkins
to
communicate
with
her
.
To
her
I
have
explained
my
situation
,
*NL*
but
without
the
horrors
which
I
may
only
surmise
.
It
would
shock
and
*NL*
frighten
her
to
death
were
I
to
expose
my
heart
to
her
.
Should
the
*NL*
letters
not
carry
,
then
the
Count
shall
not
yet
know
my
secret
or
the
*NL*
extent
of
my
knowledge
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
given
the
letters
;
I
threw
them
through
the
bars
of
my
window
*NL*
with
a
gold
piece
,
and
made
what
signs
I
could
to
have
them
posted
.
The
*NL*
man
who
took
them
pressed
them
to
his
heart
and
bowed
,
and
then
put
them
*NL*
in
his
cap
.
I
could
do
no
more
.
I
stole
back
to
the
study
,
and
began
to
*NL*
read
.
As
the
Count
did
not
come
in
,
I
have
written
here
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
has
come
.
He
sat
down
beside
me
,
and
said
in
his
smoothest
*NL*
voice
as
he
opened
two
letters
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Szgany
has
given
me
these
,
of
which
,
though
I
know
not
whence
they
*NL*
come
,
I
shall
,
of
course
,
take
care
.
See
!
''
--
he
must
have
looked
at
*NL*
it
--
``
one
is
from
you
,
and
to
my
friend
Peter
Hawkins
;
the
other
''
--
here
*NL*
he
caught
sight
of
the
strange
symbols
as
he
opened
the
envelope
,
and
*NL*
the
dark
look
came
into
his
face
,
and
his
eyes
blazed
wickedly
--
``
the
*NL*
other
is
a
vile
thing
,
an
outrage
upon
friendship
and
hospitality
!
It
is
*NL*
not
signed
.
Well
!
so
it
can
not
matter
to
us
.
''
And
he
calmly
held
letter
*NL*
and
envelope
in
the
flame
of
the
lamp
till
they
were
consumed
.
Then
he
*NL*
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
letter
to
Hawkins
--
that
I
shall
,
of
course
,
send
on
,
since
it
is
*NL*
yours
.
Your
letters
are
sacred
to
me
.
Your
pardon
,
my
friend
,
that
*NL*
unknowingly
I
did
break
the
seal
.
Will
you
not
cover
it
again
?
''
He
held
*NL*
out
the
letter
to
me
,
and
with
a
courteous
bow
handed
me
a
clean
*NL*
envelope
.
I
could
only
redirect
it
and
hand
it
to
him
in
silence
.
When
*NL*
he
went
out
of
the
room
I
could
hear
the
key
turn
softly
.
A
minute
later
*NL*
I
went
over
and
tried
it
,
and
the
door
was
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
an
hour
or
two
after
,
the
Count
came
quietly
into
the
room
,
his
*NL*
coming
awakened
me
,
for
I
had
gone
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
.
He
was
very
*NL*
courteous
and
very
cheery
in
his
manner
,
and
seeing
that
I
had
been
*NL*
sleeping
,
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
my
friend
,
you
are
tired
?
Get
to
bed
.
There
is
the
surest
rest
.
I
*NL*
may
not
have
the
pleasure
to
talk
to-night
,
since
there
are
many
labours
*NL*
to
me
;
but
you
will
sleep
,
I
pray
.
''
I
passed
to
my
room
and
went
to
bed
,
*NL*
and
,
strange
to
say
,
slept
without
dreaming
.
Despair
has
its
own
calms
.

This
morning
when
I
woke
I
thought
I
would
provide
myself
*NL*
with
some
paper
and
envelopes
from
my
bag
and
keep
them
in
my
pocket
,
so
*NL*
that
I
might
write
in
case
I
should
get
an
opportunity
,
but
again
a
*NL*
surprise
,
again
a
shock
!
*NL*
*NL*
Every
scrap
of
paper
was
gone
,
and
with
it
all
my
notes
,
my
memoranda
,
*NL*
relating
to
railways
and
travel
,
my
letter
of
credit
,
in
fact
all
that
*NL*
might
be
useful
to
me
were
I
once
outside
the
castle
.
I
sat
and
pondered
*NL*
awhile
,
and
then
some
thought
occurred
to
me
,
and
I
made
search
of
my
*NL*
portmanteau
and
in
the
wardrobe
where
I
had
placed
my
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
suit
in
which
I
had
travelled
was
gone
,
and
also
my
overcoat
and
*NL*
rug
;
I
could
find
no
trace
of
them
anywhere
.
This
looked
like
some
new
*NL*
scheme
of
villainy
...

--
This
morning
,
as
I
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
*NL*
cudgelling
my
brains
,
I
heard
without
a
cracking
of
whips
and
pounding
*NL*
and
scraping
of
horses
'
feet
up
the
rocky
path
beyond
the
courtyard
.
*NL*
With
joy
I
hurried
to
the
window
,
and
saw
drive
into
the
yard
two
great
*NL*
leiter-wagons
,
each
drawn
by
eight
sturdy
horses
,
and
at
the
head
of
*NL*
each
pair
a
Slovak
,
with
his
wide
hat
,
great
nail-studded
belt
,
dirty
*NL*
sheepskin
,
and
high
boots
.
They
had
also
their
long
staves
in
hand
.
I
*NL*
ran
to
the
door
,
intending
to
descend
and
try
and
join
them
through
the
*NL*
main
hall
,
as
I
thought
that
way
might
be
opened
for
them
.
Again
a
*NL*
shock
:
my
door
was
fastened
on
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
ran
to
the
window
and
cried
to
them
.
They
looked
up
at
me
*NL*
stupidly
and
pointed
,
but
just
then
the
``
hetman
''
of
the
Szgany
came
out
,
*NL*
and
seeing
them
pointing
to
my
window
,
said
something
,
at
which
they
*NL*
laughed
.
Henceforth
no
effort
of
mine
,
no
piteous
cry
or
agonised
*NL*
entreaty
,
would
make
them
even
look
at
me
.
They
resolutely
turned
away
.
*NL*
The
leiter-wagons
contained
great
,
square
boxes
,
with
handles
of
thick
*NL*
rope
;
these
were
evidently
empty
by
the
ease
with
which
the
Slovaks
*NL*
handled
them
,
and
by
their
resonance
as
they
were
roughly
moved
.
When
*NL*
they
were
all
unloaded
and
packed
in
a
great
heap
in
one
corner
of
the
*NL*
yard
,
the
Slovaks
were
given
some
money
by
the
Szgany
,
and
spitting
on
*NL*
it
for
luck
,
lazily
went
each
to
his
horse
's
head
.
Shortly
afterwards
,
I
*NL*
heard
the
cracking
of
their
whips
die
away
in
the
distance
.

_
24
June
,
before
morning
.
_
--
Last
night
the
Count
left
me
early
,
and
*NL*
locked
himself
into
his
own
room
.
As
soon
as
I
dared
I
ran
up
the
*NL*
winding
stair
,
and
looked
out
of
the
window
,
which
opened
south
.
I
*NL*
thought
I
would
watch
for
the
Count
,
for
there
is
something
going
on
.
*NL*
The
Szgany
are
quartered
somewhere
in
the
castle
and
are
doing
work
of
*NL*
some
kind
.
I
know
it
,
for
now
and
then
I
hear
a
far-away
muffled
sound
*NL*
as
of
mattock
and
spade
,
and
,
whatever
it
is
,
it
must
be
the
end
of
some
*NL*
ruthless
villainy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
at
the
window
somewhat
less
than
half
an
hour
,
when
I
saw
*NL*
something
coming
out
of
the
Count
's
window
.
I
drew
back
and
watched
*NL*
carefully
,
and
saw
the
whole
man
emerge
.
It
was
a
new
shock
to
me
to
*NL*
find
that
he
had
on
the
suit
of
clothes
which
I
had
worn
whilst
*NL*
travelling
here
,
and
slung
over
his
shoulder
the
terrible
bag
which
I
*NL*
had
seen
the
women
take
away
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
his
quest
,
*NL*
and
in
my
garb
,
too
!
This
,
then
,
is
his
new
scheme
of
evil
:
that
he
will
*NL*
allow
others
to
see
me
,
as
they
think
,
so
that
he
may
both
leave
*NL*
evidence
that
I
have
been
seen
in
the
towns
or
villages
posting
my
own
*NL*
letters
,
and
that
any
wickedness
which
he
may
do
shall
by
the
local
*NL*
people
be
attributed
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
makes
me
rage
to
think
that
this
can
go
on
,
and
whilst
I
am
shut
up
*NL*
here
,
a
veritable
prisoner
,
but
without
that
protection
of
the
law
which
*NL*
is
even
a
criminal
's
right
and
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
would
watch
for
the
Count
's
return
,
and
for
a
long
time
sat
*NL*
doggedly
at
the
window
.
Then
I
began
to
notice
that
there
were
some
*NL*
quaint
little
specks
floating
in
the
rays
of
the
moonlight
.
They
were
*NL*
like
the
tiniest
grains
of
dust
,
and
they
whirled
round
and
gathered
in
*NL*
clusters
in
a
nebulous
sort
of
way
.
I
watched
them
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
soothing
,
and
a
sort
of
calm
stole
over
me
.
I
leaned
back
in
the
*NL*
embrasure
in
a
more
comfortable
position
,
so
that
I
could
enjoy
more
*NL*
fully
the
aerial
gambolling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
made
me
start
up
,
a
low
,
piteous
howling
of
dogs
somewhere
far
*NL*
below
in
the
valley
,
which
was
hidden
from
my
sight
.
Louder
it
seemed
to
*NL*
ring
in
my
ears
,
and
the
floating
motes
of
dust
to
take
new
shapes
to
*NL*
the
sound
as
they
danced
in
the
moonlight
.
I
felt
myself
struggling
to
*NL*
awake
to
some
call
of
my
instincts
;
nay
,
my
very
soul
was
struggling
,
*NL*
and
my
half-remembered
sensibilities
were
striving
to
answer
the
call
.
I
*NL*
was
becoming
hypnotised
!
Quicker
and
quicker
danced
the
dust
;
the
*NL*
moonbeams
seemed
to
quiver
as
they
went
by
me
into
the
mass
of
gloom
*NL*
beyond
.
More
and
more
they
gathered
till
they
seemed
to
take
dim
phantom
*NL*
shapes
.
And
then
I
started
,
broad
awake
and
in
full
possession
of
my
*NL*
senses
,
and
ran
screaming
from
the
place
.
The
phantom
shapes
,
which
were
*NL*
becoming
gradually
materialised
from
the
moonbeams
,
were
those
of
the
*NL*
three
ghostly
women
to
whom
I
was
doomed
.
I
fled
,
and
felt
somewhat
*NL*
safer
in
my
own
room
,
where
there
was
no
moonlight
and
where
the
lamp
*NL*
was
burning
brightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
couple
of
hours
had
passed
I
heard
something
stirring
in
the
*NL*
Count
's
room
,
something
like
a
sharp
wail
quickly
suppressed
;
and
then
*NL*
there
was
silence
,
deep
,
awful
silence
,
which
chilled
me
.
With
a
*NL*
beating
heart
,
I
tried
the
door
;
but
I
was
locked
in
my
prison
,
and
*NL*
could
do
nothing
.
I
sat
down
and
simply
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
sat
I
heard
a
sound
in
the
courtyard
without
--
the
agonised
cry
of
a
*NL*
woman
.
I
rushed
to
the
window
,
and
throwing
it
up
,
peered
out
between
*NL*
the
bars
.
There
,
indeed
,
was
a
woman
with
dishevelled
hair
,
holding
her
*NL*
hands
over
her
heart
as
one
distressed
with
running
.
She
was
leaning
*NL*
against
a
corner
of
the
gateway
.
When
she
saw
my
face
at
the
window
she
*NL*
threw
herself
forward
,
and
shouted
in
a
voice
laden
with
menace
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monster
,
give
me
my
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
herself
on
her
knees
,
and
raising
up
her
hands
,
cried
the
same
*NL*
words
in
tones
which
wrung
my
heart
.
Then
she
tore
her
hair
and
beat
her
*NL*
breast
,
and
abandoned
herself
to
all
the
violences
of
extravagant
*NL*
emotion
.
Finally
,
she
threw
herself
forward
,
and
,
though
I
could
not
see
*NL*
her
,
I
could
hear
the
beating
of
her
naked
hands
against
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somewhere
high
overhead
,
probably
on
the
tower
,
I
heard
the
voice
of
the
*NL*
Count
calling
in
his
harsh
,
metallic
whisper
.
His
call
seemed
to
be
*NL*
answered
from
far
and
wide
by
the
howling
of
wolves
.
Before
many
minutes
*NL*
had
passed
a
pack
of
them
poured
,
like
a
pent-up
dam
when
liberated
,
*NL*
through
the
wide
entrance
into
the
courtyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
cry
from
the
woman
,
and
the
howling
of
the
wolves
was
but
*NL*
short
.
Before
long
they
streamed
away
singly
,
licking
their
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
pity
her
,
for
I
knew
now
what
had
become
of
her
child
,
and
*NL*
she
was
better
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
shall
I
do
?
what
can
I
do
?
How
can
I
escape
from
this
dreadful
*NL*
thing
of
night
and
gloom
and
fear
?
*NL*
*NL*
*

*NL*
_
25
June
,
morning
.
_
--
No
man
knows
till
he
has
suffered
from
the
night
*NL*
how
sweet
and
how
dear
to
his
heart
and
eye
the
morning
can
be
.
When
the
*NL*
sun
grew
so
high
this
morning
that
it
struck
the
top
of
the
great
*NL*
gateway
opposite
my
window
,
the
high
spot
which
it
touched
seemed
to
me
*NL*
as
if
the
dove
from
the
ark
had
lighted
there
.
My
fear
fell
from
me
as
*NL*
if
it
had
been
a
vaporous
garment
which
dissolved
in
the
warmth
.
I
must
*NL*
take
action
of
some
sort
whilst
the
courage
of
the
day
is
upon
me
.
Last
*NL*
night
one
of
my
post-dated
letters
went
to
post
,
the
first
of
that
fatal
*NL*
series
which
is
to
blot
out
the
very
traces
of
my
existence
from
the
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
me
not
think
of
it
.
Action
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
always
been
at
night-time
that
I
have
been
molested
or
*NL*
threatened
,
or
in
some
way
in
danger
or
in
fear
.
I
have
not
yet
seen
the
*NL*
Count
in
the
daylight
.
Can
it
be
that
he
sleeps
when
others
wake
,
that
*NL*
he
may
be
awake
whilst
they
sleep
?
If
I
could
only
get
into
his
room
!
*NL*
But
there
is
no
possible
way
.
The
door
is
always
locked
,
no
way
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
there
is
a
way
,
if
one
dares
to
take
it
.
Where
his
body
has
gone
*NL*
why
may
not
another
body
go
?
I
have
seen
him
myself
crawl
from
his
*NL*
window
.
Why
should
not
I
imitate
him
,
and
go
in
by
his
window
?
The
*NL*
chances
are
desperate
,
but
my
need
is
more
desperate
still
.
I
shall
risk
*NL*
it
.
At
the
worst
it
can
only
be
death
;
and
a
man
's
death
is
not
a
*NL*
calf
's
,
and
the
dreaded
Hereafter
may
still
be
open
to
me
.
God
help
me
*NL*
in
my
task
!
Good-bye
,
Mina
,
if
I
fail
;
good-bye
,
my
faithful
friend
and
*NL*
second
father
;
good-bye
,
all
,
and
last
of
all
Mina
!

*NL*
_
Same
day
,
later
.
_
--
I
have
made
the
effort
,
and
God
,
helping
me
,
have
*NL*
come
safely
back
to
this
room
.
I
must
put
down
every
detail
in
order
.
I
*NL*
went
whilst
my
courage
was
fresh
straight
to
the
window
on
the
south
*NL*
side
,
and
at
once
got
outside
on
the
narrow
ledge
of
stone
which
runs
*NL*
around
the
building
on
this
side
.
The
stones
are
big
and
roughly
cut
,
*NL*
and
the
mortar
has
by
process
of
time
been
washed
away
between
them
.
I
*NL*
took
off
my
boots
,
and
ventured
out
on
the
desperate
way
.
I
looked
down
*NL*
once
,
so
as
to
make
sure
that
a
sudden
glimpse
of
the
awful
depth
would
*NL*
not
overcome
me
,
but
after
that
kept
my
eyes
away
from
it
.
I
knew
pretty
*NL*
well
the
direction
and
distance
of
the
Count
's
window
,
and
made
for
it
*NL*
as
well
as
I
could
,
having
regard
to
the
opportunities
available
.
I
did
*NL*
not
feel
dizzy
--
I
suppose
I
was
too
excited
--
and
the
time
seemed
*NL*
ridiculously
short
till
I
found
myself
standing
on
the
window-sill
and
*NL*
trying
to
raise
up
the
sash
.
I
was
filled
with
agitation
,
however
,
when
*NL*
I
bent
down
and
slid
feet
foremost
in
through
the
window
.
Then
I
looked
*NL*
around
for
the
Count
,
but
,
with
surprise
and
gladness
,
made
a
discovery
.
*NL*
The
room
was
empty
!
It
was
barely
furnished
with
odd
things
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
have
never
been
used
;
the
furniture
was
something
the
same
*NL*
style
as
that
in
the
south
rooms
,
and
was
covered
with
dust
.
I
looked
*NL*
for
the
key
,
but
it
was
not
in
the
lock
,
and
I
could
not
find
it
*NL*
anywhere
.
The
only
thing
I
found
was
a
great
heap
of
gold
in
one
*NL*
corner
--
gold
of
all
kinds
,
Roman
,
and
British
,
and
Austrian
,
and
*NL*
Hungarian
,
and
Greek
and
Turkish
money
,
covered
with
a
film
of
dust
,
as
*NL*
though
it
had
lain
long
in
the
ground
.
None
of
it
that
I
noticed
was
*NL*
less
than
three
hundred
years
old
.
There
were
also
chains
and
ornaments
,
*NL*
some
jewelled
,
but
all
of
them
old
and
stained
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
corner
of
the
room
was
a
heavy
door
.
I
tried
it
,
for
,
since
I
*NL*
could
not
find
the
key
of
the
room
or
the
key
of
the
outer
door
,
which
*NL*
was
the
main
object
of
my
search
,
I
must
make
further
examination
,
or
*NL*
all
my
efforts
would
be
in
vain
.
It
was
open
,
and
led
through
a
stone
*NL*
passage
to
a
circular
stairway
,
which
went
steeply
down
.
I
descended
,
*NL*
minding
carefully
where
I
went
,
for
the
stairs
were
dark
,
being
only
lit
*NL*
by
loopholes
in
the
heavy
masonry
.
At
the
bottom
there
was
a
dark
,
*NL*
tunnel-like
passage
,
through
which
came
a
deathly
,
sickly
odour
,
the
*NL*
odour
of
old
earth
newly
turned
.
As
I
went
through
the
passage
the
smell
*NL*
grew
closer
and
heavier
.
At
last
I
pulled
open
a
heavy
door
which
stood
*NL*
ajar
,
and
found
myself
in
an
old
,
ruined
chapel
,
which
had
evidently
*NL*
been
used
as
a
graveyard
.
The
roof
was
broken
,
and
in
two
places
were
*NL*
steps
leading
to
vaults
,
but
the
ground
had
recently
been
dug
over
,
and
*NL*
the
earth
placed
in
great
wooden
boxes
,
manifestly
those
which
had
been
*NL*
brought
by
the
Slovaks
.
There
was
nobody
about
,
and
I
made
search
for
*NL*
any
further
outlet
,
but
there
was
none
.
Then
I
went
over
every
inch
of
*NL*
the
ground
,
so
as
not
to
lose
a
chance
.
I
went
down
even
into
the
*NL*
vaults
,
where
the
dim
light
struggled
,
although
to
do
so
was
a
dread
to
*NL*
my
very
soul
.
Into
two
of
these
I
went
,
but
saw
nothing
except
fragments
*NL*
of
old
coffins
and
piles
of
dust
;
in
the
third
,
however
,
I
made
a
*NL*
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
in
one
of
the
great
boxes
,
of
which
there
were
fifty
in
all
,
on
a
*NL*
pile
of
newly
dug
earth
,
lay
the
Count
!
He
was
either
dead
or
asleep
,
I
*NL*
could
not
say
which
--
for
the
eyes
were
open
and
stony
,
but
without
the
*NL*
glassiness
of
death
--
and
the
cheeks
had
the
warmth
of
life
through
all
*NL*
their
pallor
;
the
lips
were
as
red
as
ever
.
But
there
was
no
sign
of
*NL*
movement
,
no
pulse
,
no
breath
,
no
beating
of
the
heart
.
I
bent
over
him
,
*NL*
and
tried
to
find
any
sign
of
life
,
but
in
vain
.
He
could
not
have
lain
*NL*
there
long
,
for
the
earthy
smell
would
have
passed
away
in
a
few
hours
.
*NL*
By
the
side
of
the
box
was
its
cover
,
pierced
with
holes
here
and
there
.
*NL*
I
thought
he
might
have
the
keys
on
him
,
but
when
I
went
to
search
I
saw
*NL*
the
dead
eyes
,
and
in
them
,
dead
though
they
were
,
such
a
look
of
hate
,
*NL*
though
unconscious
of
me
or
my
presence
,
that
I
fled
from
the
place
,
and
*NL*
leaving
the
Count
's
room
by
the
window
,
crawled
again
up
the
castle
*NL*
wall
.
Regaining
my
room
,
I
threw
myself
panting
upon
the
bed
and
tried
*NL*
to
think
...
*NL*
*NL*

_
29
June
.
_
--
To-day
is
the
date
of
my
last
letter
,
and
the
Count
has
*NL*
taken
steps
to
prove
that
it
was
genuine
,
for
again
I
saw
him
leave
the
*NL*
castle
by
the
same
window
,
and
in
my
clothes
.
As
he
went
down
the
wall
,
*NL*
lizard
fashion
,
I
wished
I
had
a
gun
or
some
lethal
weapon
,
that
I
might
*NL*
destroy
him
;
but
I
fear
that
no
weapon
wrought
alone
by
man
's
hand
would
*NL*
have
any
effect
on
him
.
I
dared
not
wait
to
see
him
return
,
for
I
feared
*NL*
to
see
those
weird
sisters
.
I
came
back
to
the
library
,
and
read
there
*NL*
till
I
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
awakened
by
the
Count
,
who
looked
at
me
as
grimly
as
a
man
can
*NL*
look
as
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
my
friend
,
we
must
part
.
You
return
to
your
beautiful
*NL*
England
,
I
to
some
work
which
may
have
such
an
end
that
we
may
never
*NL*
meet
.
Your
letter
home
has
been
despatched
;
to-morrow
I
shall
not
be
*NL*
here
,
but
all
shall
be
ready
for
your
journey
.
In
the
morning
come
the
*NL*
Szgany
,
who
have
some
labours
of
their
own
here
,
and
also
come
some
*NL*
Slovaks
.
When
they
have
gone
,
my
carriage
shall
come
for
you
,
and
shall
*NL*
bear
you
to
the
Borgo
Pass
to
meet
the
diligence
from
Bukovina
to
*NL*
Bistritz
.
But
I
am
in
hopes
that
I
shall
see
more
of
you
at
Castle
*NL*
Dracula
.
''
I
suspected
him
,
and
determined
to
test
his
sincerity
.
*NL*
Sincerity
!
It
seems
like
a
profanation
of
the
word
to
write
it
in
*NL*
connection
with
such
a
monster
,
so
asked
him
point-blank
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
may
I
not
go
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
dear
sir
,
my
coachman
and
horses
are
away
on
a
mission
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
would
walk
with
pleasure
.
I
want
to
get
away
at
once
.
''
He
smiled
,
*NL*
such
a
soft
,
smooth
,
diabolical
smile
that
I
knew
there
was
some
trick
*NL*
behind
his
smoothness
.
He
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
baggage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
care
about
it
.
I
can
send
for
it
some
other
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
stood
up
,
and
said
,
with
a
sweet
courtesy
which
made
me
rub
my
*NL*
eyes
,
it
seemed
so
real
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
English
have
a
saying
which
is
close
to
my
heart
,
for
its
spirit
is
*NL*
that
which
rules
our
_
boyars
_
:
`
Welcome
the
coming
;
speed
the
parting
*NL*
guest
.
'
Come
with
me
,
my
dear
young
friend
.
Not
an
hour
shall
you
wait
*NL*
in
my
house
against
your
will
,
though
sad
am
I
at
your
going
,
and
that
*NL*
you
so
suddenly
desire
it
.
Come
!
''
With
a
stately
gravity
,
he
,
with
the
*NL*
lamp
,
preceded
me
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
hall
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Close
at
hand
came
the
howling
of
many
wolves
.
It
was
almost
as
if
the
*NL*
sound
sprang
up
at
the
rising
of
his
hand
,
just
as
the
music
of
a
great
*NL*
orchestra
seems
to
leap
under
the
baton
of
the
conductor
.
After
a
pause
*NL*
of
a
moment
,
he
proceeded
,
in
his
stately
way
,
to
the
door
,
drew
back
*NL*
the
ponderous
bolts
,
unhooked
the
heavy
chains
,
and
began
to
draw
it
*NL*
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
my
intense
astonishment
I
saw
that
it
was
unlocked
.
Suspiciously
,
I
*NL*
looked
all
round
,
but
could
see
no
key
of
any
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
door
began
to
open
,
the
howling
of
the
wolves
without
grew
louder
*NL*
and
angrier
;
their
red
jaws
,
with
champing
teeth
,
and
their
blunt-clawed
*NL*
feet
as
they
leaped
,
came
in
through
the
opening
door
.
I
knew
then
that
*NL*
to
struggle
at
the
moment
against
the
Count
was
useless
.
With
such
*NL*
allies
as
these
at
his
command
,
I
could
do
nothing
.
But
still
the
door
*NL*
continued
slowly
to
open
,
and
only
the
Count
's
body
stood
in
the
gap
.
*NL*
Suddenly
it
struck
me
that
this
might
be
the
moment
and
means
of
my
*NL*
doom
;
I
was
to
be
given
to
the
wolves
,
and
at
my
own
instigation
.
There
*NL*
was
a
diabolical
wickedness
in
the
idea
great
enough
for
the
Count
,
and
*NL*
as
a
last
chance
I
cried
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
the
door
;
I
shall
wait
till
morning
!
''
and
covered
my
face
with
my
*NL*
hands
to
hide
my
tears
of
bitter
disappointment
.
With
one
sweep
of
his
*NL*
powerful
arm
,
the
Count
threw
the
door
shut
,
and
the
great
bolts
clanged
*NL*
and
echoed
through
the
hall
as
they
shot
back
into
their
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
silence
we
returned
to
the
library
,
and
after
a
minute
or
two
I
went
*NL*
to
my
own
room
.
The
last
I
saw
of
Count
Dracula
was
his
kissing
his
hand
*NL*
to
me
;
with
a
red
light
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
,
and
with
a
smile
that
*NL*
Judas
in
hell
might
be
proud
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
in
my
room
and
about
to
lie
down
,
I
thought
I
heard
a
*NL*
whispering
at
my
door
.
I
went
to
it
softly
and
listened
.
Unless
my
ears
*NL*
deceived
me
,
I
heard
the
voice
of
the
Count
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Back
,
back
,
to
your
own
place
!
Your
time
is
not
yet
come
.
Wait
!
Have
*NL*
patience
!
To-night
is
mine
.
To-morrow
night
is
yours
!
''
There
was
a
low
,
*NL*
sweet
ripple
of
laughter
,
and
in
a
rage
I
threw
open
the
door
,
and
saw
*NL*
without
the
three
terrible
women
licking
their
lips
.
As
I
appeared
they
*NL*
all
joined
in
a
horrible
laugh
,
and
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
back
to
my
room
and
threw
myself
on
my
knees
.
It
is
then
so
near
*NL*
the
end
?
To-morrow
!
to-morrow
!
Lord
,
help
me
,
and
those
to
whom
I
am
*NL*
dear
!
*NL*
*NL*

_
30
June
,
morning
.
_
--
These
may
be
the
last
words
I
ever
write
in
this
*NL*
diary
.
I
slept
till
just
before
the
dawn
,
and
when
I
woke
threw
myself
*NL*
on
my
knees
,
for
I
determined
that
if
Death
came
he
should
find
me
*NL*
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
I
felt
that
subtle
change
in
the
air
,
and
knew
that
the
morning
*NL*
had
come
.
Then
came
the
welcome
cock-crow
,
and
I
felt
that
I
was
safe
.
*NL*
With
a
glad
heart
,
I
opened
my
door
and
ran
down
to
the
hall
.
I
had
seen
*NL*
that
the
door
was
unlocked
,
and
now
escape
was
before
me
.
With
hands
*NL*
that
trembled
with
eagerness
,
I
unhooked
the
chains
and
drew
back
the
*NL*
massive
bolts
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
door
would
not
move
.
Despair
seized
me
.
I
pulled
,
and
pulled
,
at
*NL*
the
door
,
and
shook
it
till
,
massive
as
it
was
,
it
rattled
in
its
*NL*
casement
.
I
could
see
the
bolt
shot
.
It
had
been
locked
after
I
left
the
*NL*
Count
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
wild
desire
took
me
to
obtain
that
key
at
any
risk
,
and
I
*NL*
determined
then
and
there
to
scale
the
wall
again
and
gain
the
Count
's
*NL*
room
.
He
might
kill
me
,
but
death
now
seemed
the
happier
choice
of
*NL*
evils
.
Without
a
pause
I
rushed
up
to
the
east
window
,
and
scrambled
*NL*
down
the
wall
,
as
before
,
into
the
Count
's
room
.
It
was
empty
,
but
that
*NL*
was
as
I
expected
.
I
could
not
see
a
key
anywhere
,
but
the
heap
of
gold
*NL*
remained
.
I
went
through
the
door
in
the
corner
and
down
the
winding
*NL*
stair
and
along
the
dark
passage
to
the
old
chapel
.
I
knew
now
well
*NL*
enough
where
to
find
the
monster
I
sought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
box
was
in
the
same
place
,
close
against
the
wall
,
but
the
lid
*NL*
was
laid
on
it
,
not
fastened
down
,
but
with
the
nails
ready
in
their
*NL*
places
to
be
hammered
home
.
I
knew
I
must
reach
the
body
for
the
key
,
so
*NL*
I
raised
the
lid
,
and
laid
it
back
against
the
wall
;
and
then
I
saw
*NL*
something
which
filled
my
very
soul
with
horror
.
There
lay
the
Count
,
*NL*
but
looking
as
if
his
youth
had
been
half
renewed
,
for
the
white
hair
*NL*
and
moustache
were
changed
to
dark
iron-grey
;
the
cheeks
were
fuller
,
*NL*
and
the
white
skin
seemed
ruby-red
underneath
;
the
mouth
was
redder
than
*NL*
ever
,
for
on
the
lips
were
gouts
of
fresh
blood
,
which
trickled
from
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
mouth
and
ran
over
the
chin
and
neck
.
Even
the
deep
,
*NL*
burning
eyes
seemed
set
amongst
swollen
flesh
,
for
the
lids
and
pouches
*NL*
underneath
were
bloated
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
whole
awful
creature
were
*NL*
simply
gorged
with
blood
.
He
lay
like
a
filthy
leech
,
exhausted
with
his
*NL*
repletion
.
I
shuddered
as
I
bent
over
to
touch
him
,
and
every
sense
in
*NL*
me
revolted
at
the
contact
;
but
I
had
to
search
,
or
I
was
lost
.
The
*NL*
coming
night
might
see
my
own
body
a
banquet
in
a
similar
way
to
those
*NL*
horrid
three
.
I
felt
all
over
the
body
,
but
no
sign
could
I
find
of
the
*NL*
key
.
Then
I
stopped
and
looked
at
the
Count
.
There
was
a
mocking
smile
*NL*
on
the
bloated
face
which
seemed
to
drive
me
mad
.
This
was
the
being
I
*NL*
was
helping
to
transfer
to
London
,
where
,
perhaps
,
for
centuries
to
come
*NL*
he
might
,
amongst
its
teeming
millions
,
satiate
his
lust
for
blood
,
and
*NL*
create
a
new
and
ever-widening
circle
of
semi-demons
to
batten
on
the
*NL*
helpless
.
The
very
thought
drove
me
mad
.
A
terrible
desire
came
upon
me
*NL*
to
rid
the
world
of
such
a
monster
.
There
was
no
lethal
weapon
at
hand
,
*NL*
but
I
seized
a
shovel
which
the
workmen
had
been
using
to
fill
the
*NL*
cases
,
and
lifting
it
high
,
struck
,
with
the
edge
downward
,
at
the
*NL*
hateful
face
.
But
as
I
did
so
the
head
turned
,
and
the
eyes
fell
full
*NL*
upon
me
,
with
all
their
blaze
of
basilisk
horror
.
The
sight
seemed
to
*NL*
paralyse
me
,
and
the
shovel
turned
in
my
hand
and
glanced
from
the
face
,
*NL*
merely
making
a
deep
gash
above
the
forehead
.
The
shovel
fell
from
my
*NL*
hand
across
the
box
,
and
as
I
pulled
it
away
the
flange
of
the
blade
*NL*
caught
the
edge
of
the
lid
which
fell
over
again
,
and
hid
the
horrid
*NL*
thing
from
my
sight
.
The
last
glimpse
I
had
was
of
the
bloated
face
,
*NL*
blood-stained
and
fixed
with
a
grin
of
malice
which
would
have
held
its
*NL*
own
in
the
nethermost
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
and
thought
what
should
be
my
next
move
,
but
my
brain
seemed
*NL*
on
fire
,
and
I
waited
with
a
despairing
feeling
growing
over
me
.
As
I
*NL*
waited
I
heard
in
the
distance
a
gipsy
song
sung
by
merry
voices
coming
*NL*
closer
,
and
through
their
song
the
rolling
of
heavy
wheels
and
the
*NL*
cracking
of
whips
;
the
Szgany
and
the
Slovaks
of
whom
the
Count
had
*NL*
spoken
were
coming
.
With
a
last
look
around
and
at
the
box
which
*NL*
contained
the
vile
body
,
I
ran
from
the
place
and
gained
the
Count
's
*NL*
room
,
determined
to
rush
out
at
the
moment
the
door
should
be
opened
.
*NL*
With
strained
ears
,
I
listened
,
and
heard
downstairs
the
grinding
of
the
*NL*
key
in
the
great
lock
and
the
falling
back
of
the
heavy
door
.
There
must
*NL*
have
been
some
other
means
of
entry
,
or
some
one
had
a
key
for
one
of
*NL*
the
locked
doors
.
Then
there
came
the
sound
of
many
feet
tramping
and
*NL*
dying
away
in
some
passage
which
sent
up
a
clanging
echo
.
I
turned
to
*NL*
run
down
again
towards
the
vault
,
where
I
might
find
the
new
entrance
;
*NL*
but
at
the
moment
there
seemed
to
come
a
violent
puff
of
wind
,
and
the
*NL*
door
to
the
winding
stair
blew
to
with
a
shock
that
set
the
dust
from
*NL*
the
lintels
flying
.
When
I
ran
to
push
it
open
,
I
found
that
it
was
*NL*
hopelessly
fast
.
I
was
again
a
prisoner
,
and
the
net
of
doom
was
closing
*NL*
round
me
more
closely
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
write
there
is
in
the
passage
below
a
sound
of
many
tramping
feet
*NL*
and
the
crash
of
weights
being
set
down
heavily
,
doubtless
the
boxes
,
*NL*
with
their
freight
of
earth
.
There
is
a
sound
of
hammering
;
it
is
the
*NL*
box
being
nailed
down
.
Now
I
can
hear
the
heavy
feet
tramping
again
*NL*
along
the
hall
,
with
many
other
idle
feet
coming
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
is
shut
,
and
the
chains
rattle
;
there
is
a
grinding
of
the
key
*NL*
in
the
lock
;
I
can
hear
the
key
withdraw
:
then
another
door
opens
and
*NL*
shuts
;
I
hear
the
creaking
of
lock
and
bolt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hark
!
in
the
courtyard
and
down
the
rocky
way
the
roll
of
heavy
wheels
,
*NL*
the
crack
of
whips
,
and
the
chorus
of
the
Szgany
as
they
pass
into
the
*NL*
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
alone
in
the
castle
with
those
awful
women
.
Faugh
!
Mina
is
a
woman
,
*NL*
and
there
is
nought
in
common
.
They
are
devils
of
the
Pit
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
not
remain
alone
with
them
;
I
shall
try
to
scale
the
castle
wall
*NL*
farther
than
I
have
yet
attempted
.
I
shall
take
some
of
the
gold
with
*NL*
me
,
lest
I
want
it
later
.
I
may
find
a
way
from
this
dreadful
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
away
for
home
!
away
to
the
quickest
and
nearest
train
!
away
*NL*
from
this
cursed
spot
,
from
this
cursed
land
,
where
the
devil
and
his
*NL*
children
still
walk
with
earthly
feet
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
least
God
's
mercy
is
better
than
that
of
these
monsters
,
and
the
*NL*
precipice
is
steep
and
high
.
At
its
foot
a
man
may
sleep
--
as
a
man
.
*NL*
Good-bye
,
all
!
Mina
!

*NL*
``
My
dearest
Lucy
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
my
long
delay
in
writing
,
but
I
have
been
simply
overwhelmed
*NL*
with
work
.
The
life
of
an
assistant
schoolmistress
is
sometimes
trying
.
*NL*
I
am
longing
to
be
with
you
,
and
by
the
sea
,
where
we
can
talk
together
*NL*
freely
and
build
our
castles
in
the
air
.
I
have
been
working
very
hard
*NL*
lately
,
because
I
want
to
keep
up
with
Jonathan
's
studies
,
and
I
have
*NL*
been
practising
shorthand
very
assiduously
.
When
we
are
married
I
shall
*NL*
be
able
to
be
useful
to
Jonathan
,
and
if
I
can
stenograph
well
enough
I
*NL*
can
take
down
what
he
wants
to
say
in
this
way
and
write
it
out
for
*NL*
him
on
the
typewriter
,
at
which
also
I
am
practising
very
hard
.
He
*NL*
and
I
sometimes
write
letters
in
shorthand
,
and
he
is
keeping
a
*NL*
stenographic
journal
of
his
travels
abroad
.
When
I
am
with
you
I
*NL*
shall
keep
a
diary
in
the
same
way
.
I
do
n't
mean
one
of
those
*NL*
two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner
diaries
,
but
a
*NL*
sort
of
journal
which
I
can
write
in
whenever
I
feel
inclined
.
I
do
not
*NL*
suppose
there
will
be
much
of
interest
to
other
people
;
but
it
is
not
*NL*
intended
for
them
.
I
may
show
it
to
Jonathan
some
day
if
there
is
in
it
*NL*
anything
worth
sharing
,
but
it
is
really
an
exercise
book
.
I
shall
try
*NL*
to
do
what
I
see
lady
journalists
do
:
interviewing
and
writing
*NL*
descriptions
and
trying
to
remember
conversations
.
I
am
told
that
,
with
*NL*
a
little
practice
,
one
can
remember
all
that
goes
on
or
that
one
hears
*NL*
said
during
a
day
.
However
,
we
shall
see
.
I
will
tell
you
of
my
little
*NL*
plans
when
we
meet
.
I
have
just
had
a
few
hurried
lines
from
Jonathan
*NL*
from
Transylvania
.
He
is
well
,
and
will
be
returning
in
about
a
week
.
I
*NL*
am
longing
to
hear
all
his
news
.
It
must
be
so
nice
to
see
strange
*NL*
countries
.
I
wonder
if
we
--
I
mean
Jonathan
and
I
--
shall
ever
see
them
*NL*
together
.
There
is
the
ten
o'clock
bell
ringing
.
Good-bye

``
My
dearest
Mina
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
you
tax
me
_
very
_
unfairly
with
being
a
bad
correspondent
.
I
*NL*
wrote
to
you
_
twice
_
since
we
parted
,
and
your
last
letter
was
only
your
*NL*
_
second
_
.
Besides
,
I
have
nothing
to
tell
you
.
There
is
really
nothing
*NL*
to
interest
you
.
Town
is
very
pleasant
just
now
,
and
we
go
a
good
deal
*NL*
to
picture-galleries
and
for
walks
and
rides
in
the
park
.
As
to
the
*NL*
tall
,
curly-haired
man
,
I
suppose
it
was
the
one
who
was
with
me
at
the
*NL*
last
Pop
.
Some
one
has
evidently
been
telling
tales
.
That
was
Mr.
*NL*
Holmwood
.
He
often
comes
to
see
us
,
and
he
and
mamma
get
on
very
well
*NL*
together
;
they
have
so
many
things
to
talk
about
in
common
.
We
met
some
*NL*
time
ago
a
man
that
would
just
_
do
for
you
_
,
if
you
were
not
already
*NL*
engaged
to
Jonathan
.
He
is
an
excellent
_
parti
_
,
being
handsome
,
well
*NL*
off
,
and
of
good
birth
.
He
is
a
doctor
and
really
clever
.
Just
fancy
!
He
*NL*
is
only
nine-and-twenty
,
and
he
has
an
immense
lunatic
asylum
all
under
*NL*
his
own
care
.
Mr.
Holmwood
introduced
him
to
me
,
and
he
called
here
to
*NL*
see
us
,
and
often
comes
now
.
I
think
he
is
one
of
the
most
resolute
men
*NL*
I
ever
saw
,
and
yet
the
most
calm
.
He
seems
absolutely
imperturbable
.
I
*NL*
can
fancy
what
a
wonderful
power
he
must
have
over
his
patients
.
He
has
*NL*
a
curious
habit
of
looking
one
straight
in
the
face
,
as
if
trying
to
*NL*
read
one
's
thoughts
.
He
tries
this
on
very
much
with
me
,
but
I
flatter
*NL*
myself
he
has
got
a
tough
nut
to
crack
.
I
know
that
from
my
glass
.
Do
*NL*
you
ever
try
to
read
your
own
face
?
_
I
do
_
,
and
I
can
tell
you
it
is
not
*NL*
a
bad
study
,
and
gives
you
more
trouble
than
you
can
well
fancy
if
you
*NL*
have
never
tried
it
.
He
says
that
I
afford
him
a
curious
psychological
*NL*
study
,
and
I
humbly
think
I
do
.
I
do
not
,
as
you
know
,
take
sufficient
*NL*
interest
in
dress
to
be
able
to
describe
the
new
fashions
.
Dress
is
a
*NL*
bore
.
That
is
slang
again
,
but
never
mind
;
Arthur
says
that
every
day
.
*NL*
There
,
it
is
all
out
.
Mina
,
we
have
told
all
our
secrets
to
each
other
*NL*
since
we
were
_
children
_
;
we
have
slept
together
and
eaten
together
,
and
*NL*
laughed
and
cried
together
;
and
now
,
though
I
have
spoken
,
I
would
like
*NL*
to
speak
more
.
Oh
,
Mina
,
could
n't
you
guess
?
I
love
him
.
I
am
blushing
*NL*
as
I
write
,
for
although
I
_
think
_
he
loves
me
,
he
has
not
told
me
so
in
*NL*
words
.
But
oh
,
Mina
,
I
love
him
;
I
love
him
;
I
love
him
!
There
,
that
*NL*
does
me
good
.
I
wish
I
were
with
you
,
dear
,
sitting
by
the
fire
*NL*
undressing
,
as
we
used
to
sit
;
and
I
would
try
to
tell
you
what
I
feel
.
*NL*
I
do
not
know
how
I
am
writing
this
even
to
you
.
I
am
afraid
to
stop
,
*NL*
or
I
should
tear
up
the
letter
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
stop
,
for
I
_
do
_
so
*NL*
want
to
tell
you
all
.
Let
me
hear
from
you
_
at
once
_
,
and
tell
me
all
*NL*
that
you
think
about
it
.
Mina

I
must
stop

Thanks

My
dear
,
it
never
rains
but
it
pours

How
true
the
old
proverbs
are
.
*NL*
Here
am
I
,
who
shall
be
twenty
in
September
,
and
yet
I
never
had
a
*NL*
proposal
till
to-day
,
not
a
real
proposal
,
and
to-day
I
have
had
three
.
*NL*
Just
fancy
!
THREE
proposals
in
one
day
!
Is
n't
it
awful
!
I
feel
sorry
,
*NL*
really
and
truly
sorry
,
for
two
of
the
poor
fellows
.
Oh
,
Mina
,
I
am
so
*NL*
happy
that
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
with
myself
.
And
three
proposals
!
*NL*
But
,
for
goodness
'
sake
,
do
n't
tell
any
of
the
girls
,
or
they
would
be
*NL*
getting
all
sorts
of
extravagant
ideas
and
imagining
themselves
injured
*NL*
and
slighted
if
in
their
very
first
day
at
home
they
did
not
get
six
at
*NL*
least
.
Some
girls
are
so
vain
!
You
and
I
,
Mina
dear
,
who
are
engaged
and
*NL*
are
going
to
settle
down
soon
soberly
into
old
married
women
,
can
*NL*
despise
vanity
.
Well
,
I
must
tell
you
about
the
three
,
but
you
must
keep
*NL*
it
a
secret
,
dear
,
from
_
every
one
_
,
except
,
of
course
,
Jonathan
.
You
*NL*
will
tell
him
,
because
I
would
,
if
I
were
in
your
place
,
certainly
tell
*NL*
Arthur
.
A
woman
ought
to
tell
her
husband
everything
--
do
n't
you
think
*NL*
so
,
dear
?
--
and
I
must
be
fair
.
Men
like
women
,
certainly
their
wives
,
to
*NL*
be
quite
as
fair
as
they
are
;
and
women
,
I
am
afraid
,
are
not
always
*NL*
quite
as
fair
as
they
should
be
.
Well
,
my
dear
,
number
One
came
just
*NL*
before
lunch
.
I
told
you
of
him
,
Dr.
John
Seward
,
the
lunatic-asylum
*NL*
man
,
with
the
strong
jaw
and
the
good
forehead
.
He
was
very
cool
*NL*
outwardly
,
but
was
nervous
all
the
same
.
He
had
evidently
been
schooling
*NL*
himself
as
to
all
sorts
of
little
things
,
and
remembered
them
;
but
he
*NL*
almost
managed
to
sit
down
on
his
silk
hat
,
which
men
do
n't
generally
do
*NL*
when
they
are
cool
,
and
then
when
he
wanted
to
appear
at
ease
he
kept
*NL*
playing
with
a
lancet
in
a
way
that
made
me
nearly
scream
.
He
spoke
to
*NL*
me
,
Mina
,
very
straightforwardly
.
He
told
me
how
dear
I
was
to
him
,
*NL*
though
he
had
known
me
so
little
,
and
what
his
life
would
be
with
me
to
*NL*
help
and
cheer
him
.
He
was
going
to
tell
me
how
unhappy
he
would
be
if
I
*NL*
did
not
care
for
him
,
but
when
he
saw
me
cry
he
said
that
he
was
a
brute
*NL*
and
would
not
add
to
my
present
trouble
.
Then
he
broke
off
and
asked
if
*NL*
I
could
love
him
in
time
;
and
when
I
shook
my
head
his
hands
trembled
,
*NL*
and
then
with
some
hesitation
he
asked
me
if
I
cared
already
for
any
one
*NL*
else
.
He
put
it
very
nicely
,
saying
that
he
did
not
want
to
wring
my
*NL*
confidence
from
me
,
but
only
to
know
,
because
if
a
woman
's
heart
was
*NL*
free
a
man
might
have
hope
.
And
then
,
Mina
,
I
felt
a
sort
of
duty
to
*NL*
tell
him
that
there
was
some
one
.
I
only
told
him
that
much
,
and
then
he
*NL*
stood
up
,
and
he
looked
very
strong
and
very
grave
as
he
took
both
my
*NL*
hands
in
his
and
said
he
hoped
I
would
be
happy
,
and
that
if
I
ever
*NL*
wanted
a
friend
I
must
count
him
one
of
my
best
.
Oh
,
Mina
dear
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
crying
:
and
you
must
excuse
this
letter
being
all
blotted
.
Being
*NL*
proposed
to
is
all
very
nice
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
but
it
is
n't
at
*NL*
all
a
happy
thing
when
you
have
to
see
a
poor
fellow
,
whom
you
know
*NL*
loves
you
honestly
,
going
away
and
looking
all
broken-hearted
,
and
to
*NL*
know
that
,
no
matter
what
he
may
say
at
the
moment
,
you
are
passing
*NL*
quite
out
of
his
life
.
My
dear
,
I
must
stop
here
at
present
,
I
feel
so
*NL*
miserable
,
though
I
am
so
happy
.

``
Arthur
has
just
gone
,
and
I
feel
in
better
spirits
than
when
I
left
*NL*
off
,
so
I
can
go
on
telling
you
about
the
day
.
Well
,
my
dear
,
number
Two
*NL*
came
after
lunch
.
He
is
such
a
nice
fellow
,
an
American
from
Texas
,
and
*NL*
he
looks
so
young
and
so
fresh
that
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
he
*NL*
has
been
to
so
many
places
and
has
had
such
adventures
.
I
sympathise
*NL*
with
poor
Desdemona
when
she
had
such
a
dangerous
stream
poured
in
her
*NL*
ear
,
even
by
a
black
man
.
I
suppose
that
we
women
are
such
cowards
that
*NL*
we
think
a
man
will
save
us
from
fears
,
and
we
marry
him
.
I
know
now
*NL*
what
I
would
do
if
I
were
a
man
and
wanted
to
make
a
girl
love
me
.
No
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
,
for
there
was
Mr.
Morris
telling
us
his
stories
,
and
Arthur
never
*NL*
told
any
,
and
yet
--
My
dear
,
I
am
somewhat
previous
.
Mr.
Quincey
P.
*NL*
Morris
found
me
alone
.
It
seems
that
a
man
always
does
find
a
girl
*NL*
alone
.
No
,
he
does
n't
,
for
Arthur
tried
twice
to
_
make
_
a
chance
,
and
I
*NL*
helping
him
all
I
could
;
I
am
not
ashamed
to
say
it
now
.
I
must
tell
you
*NL*
beforehand
that
Mr.
Morris
does
n't
always
speak
slang
--
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
he
never
does
so
to
strangers
or
before
them
,
for
he
is
really
well
*NL*
educated
and
has
exquisite
manners
--
but
he
found
out
that
it
amused
me
*NL*
to
hear
him
talk
American
slang
,
and
whenever
I
was
present
,
and
there
*NL*
was
no
one
to
be
shocked
,
he
said
such
funny
things
.
I
am
afraid
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
he
has
to
invent
it
all
,
for
it
fits
exactly
into
whatever
else
he
*NL*
has
to
say
.
But
this
is
a
way
slang
has
.
I
do
not
know
myself
if
I
shall
*NL*
ever
speak
slang
;
I
do
not
know
if
Arthur
likes
it
,
as
I
have
never
*NL*
heard
him
use
any
as
yet
.
Well
,
Mr.
Morris
sat
down
beside
me
and
looked
*NL*
as
happy
and
jolly
as
he
could
,
but
I
could
see
all
the
same
that
he
was
*NL*
very
nervous
.
He
took
my
hand
in
his
,
and
said
ever
so
sweetly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Miss
Lucy
,
I
know
I
ai
n't
good
enough
to
regulate
the
fixin
's
of
your
*NL*
little
shoes
,
but
I
guess
if
you
wait
till
you
find
a
man
that
is
you
*NL*
will
go
join
them
seven
young
women
with
the
lamps
when
you
quit
.
Wo
n't
*NL*
you
just
hitch
up
alongside
of
me
and
let
us
go
down
the
long
road
*NL*
together
,
driving
in
double
harness
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
did
look
so
good-humoured
and
so
jolly
that
it
did
n't
seem
*NL*
half
so
hard
to
refuse
him
as
it
did
poor
Dr.
Seward
;
so
I
said
,
as
*NL*
lightly
as
I
could
,
that
I
did
not
know
anything
of
hitching
,
and
that
I
*NL*
was
n't
broken
to
harness
at
all
yet
.
Then
he
said
that
he
had
spoken
in
*NL*
a
light
manner
,
and
he
hoped
that
if
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
doing
so
*NL*
on
so
grave
,
so
momentous
,
an
occasion
for
him
,
I
would
forgive
him
.
He
*NL*
really
did
look
serious
when
he
was
saying
it
,
and
I
could
n't
help
*NL*
feeling
a
bit
serious
too
--
I
know
,
Mina
,
you
will
think
me
a
horrid
*NL*
flirt
--
though
I
could
n't
help
feeling
a
sort
of
exultation
that
he
was
*NL*
number
two
in
one
day
.
And
then
,
my
dear
,
before
I
could
say
a
word
he
*NL*
began
pouring
out
a
perfect
torrent
of
love-making
,
laying
his
very
*NL*
heart
and
soul
at
my
feet
.
He
looked
so
earnest
over
it
that
I
shall
*NL*
never
again
think
that
a
man
must
be
playful
always
,
and
never
earnest
,
*NL*
because
he
is
merry
at
times
.
I
suppose
he
saw
something
in
my
face
*NL*
which
checked
him
,
for
he
suddenly
stopped
,
and
said
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
manly
fervour
that
I
could
have
loved
him
for
if
I
had
been
free
:

''
`
Lucy

honest-hearted

should
not

you

I
am
now
if
I
did
not
believe
you

right
*NL*
through
to
the
very
depths
of
your
soul

Tell

there
any

else

you
care
for

'll
never
trouble
you
a
hair
's
breadth
again
,
but
will
be
,
if
you
will
*NL*
let
me
,
a
very
faithful

'
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mina
,
why
are
men
so
noble
when
we
women
are
so
little
worthy
*NL*
of
them
?
Here
was
I
almost
making
fun
of
this
great-hearted
,
true
*NL*
gentleman
.
I
burst
into
tears
--
I
am
afraid
,
my
dear
,
you
will
think
*NL*
this
a
very
sloppy
letter
in
more
ways
than
one
--
and
I
really
felt
very
*NL*
badly
.
Why
ca
n't
they
let
a
girl
marry
three
men
,
or
as
many
as
want
*NL*
her
,
and
save
all
this
trouble
?
But
this
is
heresy
,
and
I
must
not
say
*NL*
it
.
I
am
glad
to
say
that
,
though
I
was
crying
,
I
was
able
to
look
into
*NL*
Mr.
Morris
's
brave
eyes
,
and
I
told
him
out
straight
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,
there
is
some
one
I
love
,
though
he
has
not
told
me
yet
that
he
*NL*
even
loves
me
.
'
I
was
right
to
speak
to
him
so
frankly
,
for
quite
a
*NL*
light
came
into
his
face
,
and
he
put
out
both
his
hands
and
took
mine
--
I
*NL*
think
I
put
them
into
his
--
and
said
in
a
hearty
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
That
's
my
brave
girl
.
It
's
better
worth
being
late
for
a
chance
of
*NL*
winning
you
than
being
in
time
for
any
other
girl
in
the
world
.
Do
n't
*NL*
cry
,
my
dear
.
If
it
's
for
me
,
I
'm
a
hard
nut
to
crack
;
and
I
take
it
*NL*
standing
up
.
If
that
other
fellow
does
n't
know
his
happiness
,
well
,
he
'd
*NL*
better
look
for
it
soon
,
or
he
'll
have
to
deal
with
me
.
Little
girl
,
*NL*
your
honesty
and
pluck
have
made
me
a
friend
,
and
that
's
rarer
than
a
*NL*
lover
;
it
's
more
unselfish
anyhow
.
My
dear
,
I
'm
going
to
have
a
pretty
*NL*
lonely
walk
between
this
and
Kingdom
Come
.
Wo
n't
you
give
me
one
kiss
?
*NL*
It
'll
be
something
to
keep
off
the
darkness
now
and
then
.
You
can
,
you
*NL*
know
,
if
you
like
,
for
that
other
good
fellow

he
must
be
a
good
fellow

*NL*
my
dear
,
and
a
fine
fellow
,
or
you
could
not
love
him

has
n't
spoken
*NL*
yet

'
That
quite
won
me
,
Mina
,
for
it
_
was
_
brave
and
sweet
of
him
,
and
*NL*
noble
,
too
,
to
a
rival
--
was
n't
it
?
--
and
he
so
sad
;
so
I
leant
over
and
*NL*
kissed
him
.
He
stood
up
with
my
two
hands
in
his
,
and
as
he
looked
down
*NL*
into
my
face
--
I
am
afraid
I
was
blushing
very
much
--
he
said
:
--
*NL*

''
`
Little

I
hold
your
hand
,
and
you
've
kissed
me
,

if
these
*NL*
things
do
n't
make
us
friends
nothing
ever
will
.
Thank
you
for
your
sweet
*NL*
honesty
to
me
,
and
good-bye
.
'
He
wrung
my
hand
,
and
taking
up
his
hat
,
*NL*
went
straight
out
of
the
room
without
looking
back
,
without
a
tear
or
a
*NL*
quiver
or
a
pause
;
and
I
am
crying
like
a
baby
.
Oh
,
why
must
a
man
like
*NL*
that
be
made
unhappy
when
there
are
lots
of
girls
about
who
would
*NL*
worship
the
very
ground
he
trod
on
?
I
know
I
would
if
I
were
free
--
only
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
be
free
.
My
dear
,
this
quite
upset
me
,
and
I
feel
I
*NL*
can
not
write
of
happiness
just
at
once
,
after
telling
you
of
it
;
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
wish
to
tell
of
the
number
three
until
it
can
be
all
happy

Besides
,
it
was
all
so
confused
;
it

only
a

from
his
*NL*
coming
into
the
room
till
both
his
arms
were
round
me
,
and
he
was
*NL*
kissing
me

I
am
very
,
very
happy
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
I
have
done
to
*NL*
deserve
it

I
must
only
try
in
the
future
to
show
that
I
am
not

ungrateful

Can

,

,
so
*NL*
diary
instead
.
Since
my
rebuff
of
yesterday
I
have
a
sort
of
empty
*NL*
feeling
;
nothing
in
the
world
seems
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
worth
*NL*
the
doing
...
As
I
knew
that
the
only
cure
for
this
sort
of
thing
was
*NL*
work
,
I
went
down
amongst
the
patients
.
I
picked
out
one
who
has
*NL*
afforded
me
a
study
of
much
interest
.
He
is
so
quaint
that
I
am
*NL*
determined
to
understand
him
as
well
as
I
can
.
To-day
I
seemed
to
get
*NL*
nearer
than
ever
before
to
the
heart
of
his
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
questioned
him
more
fully
than
I
had
ever
done
,
with
a
view
to
making
*NL*
myself
master
of
the
facts
of
his
hallucination
.
In
my
manner
of
doing
*NL*
it
there
was
,
I
now
see
,
something
of
cruelty
.
I
seemed
to
wish
to
keep
*NL*
him
to
the
point
of
his
madness
--
a
thing
which
I
avoid
with
the
patients
*NL*
as
I
would
the
mouth
of
hell
.

If
there
be
*NL*
anything
behind
this
instinct
it
will
be
valuable
to
trace
it
afterwards

accurately

Sanguine
temperament
;
great
physical
strength
;
*NL*
morbidly
excitable
;
periods
of
gloom
,
ending
in
some
fixed
idea
which
I
*NL*
can
not
make
out
.
I
presume
that
the
sanguine
temperament
itself
and
the
*NL*
disturbing
influence
end
in
a
mentally-accomplished
finish
;
a
possibly

secure
an
armour
for
their
foes
as
for
themselves
.
What
I
think
of
*NL*
on
this
point
is
,
when
self
is
the
fixed
point
the
centripetal
force
is
*NL*
balanced
with
the
centrifugal
;
when
duty
,
a
cause
,
etc.
,
is
the
fixed
*NL*
point
,
the
latter
force
is
paramount
,
and
only
accident
or
a
series
of
*NL*
accidents
can
balance
it
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
MINA
MURRAY
'S
JOURNAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
24
July
.
Whitby
.
_
--
Lucy
met
me
at
the
station
,
looking
sweeter
and
*NL*
lovelier
than
ever
,
and
we
drove
up
to
the
house
at
the
Crescent
in
*NL*
which
they
have
rooms
.
This
is
a
lovely
place
.
The
little
river
,
the
*NL*
Esk
,
runs
through
a
deep
valley
,
which
broadens
out
as
it
comes
near
the
*NL*
harbour
.
A
great
viaduct
runs
across
,
with
high
piers
,
through
which
the
*NL*
view
seems
somehow
further
away
than
it
really
is
.
The
valley
is
*NL*
beautifully
green
,
and
it
is
so
steep
that
when
you
are
on
the
high
land
*NL*
on
either
side
you
look
right
across
it
,
unless
you
are
near
enough
to
*NL*
see
down
.
The
houses
of
the
old
town
--
the
side
away
from
us
--
are
all
*NL*
red-roofed
,
and
seem
piled
up
one
over
the
other
anyhow
,
like
the
*NL*
pictures
we
see
of
Nuremberg
.
Right
over
the
town
is
the
ruin
of
Whitby
*NL*
Abbey
,
which
was
sacked
by
the
Danes
,
and
which
is
the
scene
of
part
of
*NL*
``
Marmion
,
''
where
the
girl
was
built
up
in
the
wall
.
It
is
a
most
noble
*NL*
ruin
,
of
immense
size
,
and
full
of
beautiful
and
romantic
bits
;
there
is
*NL*
a
legend
that
a
white
lady
is
seen
in
one
of
the
windows
.
Between
it
and
*NL*
the
town
there
is
another
church
,
the
parish
one
,
round
which
is
a
big
*NL*
graveyard
,
all
full
of
tombstones
.
This
is
to
my
mind
the
nicest
spot
in
*NL*
Whitby
,
for
it
lies
right
over
the
town
,
and
has
a
full
view
of
the
*NL*
harbour
and
all
up
the
bay
to
where
the
headland
called
Kettleness
*NL*
stretches
out
into
the
sea
.
It
descends
so
steeply
over
the
harbour
that
*NL*
part
of
the
bank
has
fallen
away
,
and
some
of
the
graves
have
been
*NL*
destroyed
.
In
one
place
part
of
the
stonework
of
the
graves
stretches
*NL*
out
over
the
sandy
pathway
far
below
.
There
are
walks
,
with
seats
beside
*NL*
them
,
through
the
churchyard
;
and
people
go
and
sit
there
all
day
long
*NL*
looking
at
the
beautiful
view
and
enjoying
the
breeze
.
I
shall
come
and
*NL*
sit
here
very
often
myself
and
work
.
Indeed
,
I
am
writing
now
,
with
my
*NL*
book
on
my
knee
,
and
listening
to
the
talk
of
three
old
men
who
are
*NL*
sitting
beside
me
.
They
seem
to
do
nothing
all
day
but
sit
up
here
and
*NL*
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
harbour
lies
below
me
,
with
,
on
the
far
side
,
one
long
granite
wall
*NL*
stretching
out
into
the
sea
,
with
a
curve
outwards
at
the
end
of
it
,
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
which
is
a
lighthouse
.
A
heavy
sea-wall
runs
along
outside
*NL*
of
it
.
On
the
near
side
,
the
sea-wall
makes
an
elbow
crooked
inversely
,
*NL*
and
its
end
too
has
a
lighthouse
.
Between
the
two
piers
there
is
a
*NL*
narrow
opening
into
the
harbour
,
which
then
suddenly
widens
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
nice
at
high
water
;
but
when
the
tide
is
out
it
shoals
away
to
*NL*
nothing
,
and
there
is
merely
the
stream
of
the
Esk
,
running
between
*NL*
banks
of
sand
,
with
rocks
here
and
there
.
Outside
the
harbour
on
this
*NL*
side
there
rises
for
about
half
a
mile
a
great
reef
,
the
sharp
edge
of
*NL*
which
runs
straight
out
from
behind
the
south
lighthouse
.
At
the
end
of
*NL*
it
is
a
buoy
with
a
bell
,
which
swings
in
bad
weather
,
and
sends
in
a
*NL*
mournful
sound
on
the
wind
.
They
have
a
legend
here
that
when
a
ship
is
*NL*
lost
bells
are
heard
out
at
sea
.
I
must
ask
the
old
man
about
this
;
he
*NL*
is
coming
this
way
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
a
funny
old
man
.
He
must
be
awfully
old
,
for
his
face
is
all
*NL*
gnarled
and
twisted
like
the
bark
of
a
tree
.
He
tells
me
that
he
is
*NL*
nearly
a
hundred
,
and
that
he
was
a
sailor
in
the
Greenland
fishing
*NL*
fleet
when
Waterloo
was
fought
.
He
is
,
I
am
afraid
,
a
very
sceptical
*NL*
person
,
for
when
I
asked
him
about
the
bells
at
sea
and
the
White
Lady
*NL*
at
the
abbey
he
said
very
brusquely
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
fash
masel
'
about
them
,
miss
.
Them
things
be
all
wore
out
.
*NL*
Mind
,
I
do
n't
say
that
they
never
was
,
but
I
do
say
that
they
was
n't
in
*NL*
my
time
.
They
be
all
very
well
for
comers
and
trippers
,
an
'
the
like
,
*NL*
but
not
for
a
nice
young
lady
like
you
.
Them
feet-folks
from
York
and
*NL*
Leeds
that
be
always
eatin
'
cured
herrin
's
an
'
drinkin
'
tea
an
'
lookin
'
*NL*
out
to
buy
cheap
jet
would
creed
aught
.
I
wonder
masel
'
who
'd
be
*NL*
bothered
tellin
'
lies
to
them
--
even
the
newspapers
,
which
is
full
of
*NL*
fool-talk
.
''
I
thought
he
would
be
a
good
person
to
learn
interesting
*NL*
things
from
,
so
I
asked
him
if
he
would
mind
telling
me
something
about
*NL*
the
whale-fishing
in
the
old
days
.
He
was
just
settling
himself
to
begin
*NL*
when
the
clock
struck
six
,
whereupon
he
laboured
to
get
up
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
gang
ageeanwards
home
now
,
miss
.
My
grand-daughter
does
n't
like
*NL*
to
be
kept
waitin
'
when
the
tea
is
ready
,
for
it
takes
me
time
to
*NL*
crammle
aboon
the
grees
,
for
there
be
a
many
of
'em
;
an
'
,
miss
,
I
lack
*NL*
belly-timber
sairly
by
the
clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hobbled
away
,
and
I
could
see
him
hurrying
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
down
*NL*
the
steps
.
The
steps
are
a
great
feature
on
the
place
.
They
lead
from
*NL*
the
town
up
to
the
church
,
there
are
hundreds
of
them
--
I
do
not
know
how
*NL*
many
--
and
they
wind
up
in
a
delicate
curve
;
the
slope
is
so
gentle
that
*NL*
a
horse
could
easily
walk
up
and
down
them
.
I
think
they
must
originally
*NL*
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
abbey
.
I
shall
go
home
too
.
Lucy
went
*NL*
out
visiting
with
her
mother
,
and
as
they
were
only
duty
calls
,
I
did
*NL*
not
go
.
They
will
be
home
by
this
.

_
1
August
.
_
--
I
came
up
here
an
hour
ago
with
Lucy
,
and
we
had
a
most
*NL*
interesting
talk
with
my
old
friend
and
the
two
others
who
always
come
*NL*
and
join
him
.
He
is
evidently
the
Sir
Oracle
of
them
,
and
I
should
think
*NL*
must
have
been
in
his
time
a
most
dictatorial
person
.
He
will
not
admit
*NL*
anything
,
and
downfaces
everybody
.
If
he
ca
n't
out-argue
them
he
bullies
*NL*
them
,
and
then
takes
their
silence
for
agreement
with
his
views
.
Lucy
*NL*
was
looking
sweetly
pretty
in
her
white
lawn
frock
;
she
has
got
a
*NL*
beautiful
colour
since
she
has
been
here
.
I
noticed
that
the
old
men
did
*NL*
not
lose
any
time
in
coming
up
and
sitting
near
her
when
we
sat
down
.
*NL*
She
is
so
sweet
with
old
people
;
I
think
they
all
fell
in
love
with
her
*NL*
on
the
spot
.
Even
my
old
man
succumbed
and
did
not
contradict
her
,
but
*NL*
gave
me
double
share
instead
.
I
got
him
on
the
subject
of
the
legends
,
*NL*
and
he
went
off
at
once
into
a
sort
of
sermon
.
I
must
try
to
remember
it
*NL*
and
put
it
down
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
be
all
fool-talk
,
lock
,
stock
,
and
barrel
;
that
's
what
it
be
,
an
'
*NL*
nowt
else
.

to

that
they
do

It
makes
me
ireful
to
think

not

Look

up

it

at
the
Day

when

ca

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
see
from
the
old
fellow
's
self-satisfied
air
and
the
way
in
*NL*
which
he
looked
round
for
the
approval
of
his
cronies
that
he
was
*NL*
``
showing
off
,
''
so
I
put
in
a
word
to
keep
him
going
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Swales
,
you
ca
n't
be
serious
.
Surely
these
tombstones
are
not
*NL*
all
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

There
may
be
a

few
not

where
they
make

out

;
for
there
be
folk
that
do

be

the
sea
,
if
only
it
be
their
own

The
whole

be
only

.
Now
*NL*
look
you
here
;
you
come
here
a
stranger
,
an
'
you
see
this
kirk-garth
.
''
I
*NL*
nodded
,
for
I
thought
it
better
to
assent
,
though
I
did
not
quite
*NL*
understand
his
dialect
.
I
knew
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
church
.
*NL*
He
went
on
:
``
And
you
consate
that
all
these
steans
be
aboon
folk

I
assented
again
.
``
Then
that

He
nudged
one
of
his
companions
,
*NL*
and
they
all
laughed
.
``
And
my
gog

how
could
they

I
went
over
and

read

When

back
Mr.

went
on
:

``
Who
brought

I
wonder

he
pointed
*NL*
northwards
--
``

sailed

Do
ye
think
that
all
these
men
will
have
*NL*
to
make
a
rush
to

sounds

I
have

This
was
*NL*
evidently
local
pleasantry
,
for
the
old
man
cackled
over
it
,
and
his
*NL*
cronies
joined
in
with
gusto
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

I
said
,
``
surely
you
are
not
quite
correct

for
you
start
on

assumption

will
have
to
*NL*
take
their
tombstones
with

on
the

*NL*
``

This
he
said
with
intense

scorn

``
How
will
it
pleasure
their

to
know
that

wrote
*NL*
over

He
*NL*
pointed
to
a
stone
at
our
feet
which
had
been
laid
down
as
a
slab
,
on
*NL*
which
the
seat
was
rested
,
close
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
.
``

he
said
.
The
letters
were
upside
down
to
me
*NL*
from
where
I
sat
,
but
Lucy
was
more
opposite
to
them
,
so
she
leant
over
*NL*
and
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sacred

from

erected
by

He
was
the
only

Swales
,
I

She
spoke
*NL*
her
comment
very
gravely
and
somewhat
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye

n't

that

committed
suicide
in

she
might

put

blew
nigh

he
hammered
it
with
his

stick
as
he
spoke

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
but
Lucy
turned
the
conversation
as
she
*NL*
said
,
rising
up
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
did
you
tell
us
of
this
?
It
is
my
favourite
seat
,
and
I
can
not

leave
it
;
and
now
I
find
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

And
off
*NL*
he
hobbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
and
I
sat
awhile
,
and
it
was
all
so
beautiful
before
us
that
we
*NL*
took
hands
as
we
sat
;
and
she
told
me
all
over
again
about
Arthur
and
*NL*
their
coming
marriage
.
That
made
me
just
a
little
heart-sick
,
for
I
*NL*
have
n't
heard
from
Jonathan
for
a
whole
month
.

_
The

I
came
up
here
alone
,
for
I
am
very
sad

There
was
no
*NL*
letter
for
me
.
I
hope
there
can
not
be
anything
the
matter
with
Jonathan
.
*NL*
The
clock
has
just
struck
nine
.
I
see
the
lights
scattered
all
over
the
*NL*
town
,
sometimes
in
rows
where
the
streets
are
,
and
sometimes
singly
;
*NL*
they
run
right
up
the
Esk
and
die
away
in
the
curve
of
the
valley
.
To
my
*NL*
left
the
view
is
cut
off
by
a
black
line
of
roof
of
the
old
house
next
*NL*
the
abbey
.
The
sheep
and
lambs
are
bleating
in
the
fields
away
behind
*NL*
me
,
and
there
is
a
clatter
of
a
donkey
's
hoofs
up
the
paved
road
below
.
*NL*
The
band
on
the
pier
is
playing
a
harsh
waltz
in
good
time
,
and
further
*NL*
along
the
quay
there
is
a
Salvation
Army
meeting
in
a
back
street
.
*NL*
Neither
of
the
bands
hears
the
other
,
but
up
here
I
hear
and
see
them
*NL*
both
.
I
wonder
where
Jonathan
is
and
if
he
is
thinking
of
me
!
I
wish
he
*NL*
were
here

_
--
The
case
of
Renfield
grows
more
interesting
the
more
I
get
to
*NL*
understand
the
man
.
He
has
certain
qualities
very
largely
developed
;
*NL*
selfishness
,
secrecy
,
and
purpose
.
I
wish
I
could
get
at
what
is
the
*NL*
object
of
the
latter
.
He
seems
to
have
some
settled
scheme
of
his
own
,
*NL*
but
what
it
is
I
do
not
yet
know
.
His
redeeming
quality
is
a
love
of
*NL*
animals
,
though
,
indeed
,
he
has
such
curious
turns
in
it
that
I
*NL*
sometimes
imagine
he
is
only
abnormally
cruel
.
His
pets
are
of
odd
*NL*
sorts
.
Just
now
his
hobby
is
catching
flies
.
He
has
at
present
such
a
*NL*
quantity
that
I
have
had
myself
to
expostulate
.
To
my
astonishment
,
he
*NL*
did
not
break
out
into
a
fury
,
as
I
expected
,
but
took
the
matter
in
*NL*
simple
seriousness
.
He
thought
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
:
``
May
I
have
*NL*
three
days
?
I
shall
clear
them
away
.
''
Of
course
,
I
said
that
would
do
.
I
*NL*
must
watch
him

He
has
turned
his
mind
now
to
spiders
,
and
has
got
several
*NL*
very
big
fellows
in
a
box
.
He
keeps
feeding
them
with
his
flies
,
and
*NL*
the
number
of
the
latter
is
becoming
sensibly
diminished
,
although
he
*NL*
has
used
half
his
food
in
attracting
more
flies
from
outside
to
his

room

_
--
His
spiders
are
now
becoming
as
great
a
nuisance
as
his
*NL*
flies
,
and
to-day
I
told
him
that
he
must
get
rid
of
them
.
He
looked
*NL*
very
sad
at
this
,
so
I
said
that
he
must
clear
out
some
of
them
,
at
all
*NL*
events
.
He
cheerfully
acquiesced
in
this
,
and
I
gave
him
the
same
time
*NL*
as
before
for
reduction
.
He
disgusted
me
much
while
with
him
,
for
when
a
*NL*
horrid
blow-fly
,
bloated
with
some
carrion
food
,
buzzed
into
the
room
,
*NL*
he
caught
it
,
held
it
exultantly
for
a
few
moments
between
his
finger
*NL*
and
thumb
,
and
,
before
I
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
,
put
it
in
his
*NL*
mouth
and
ate
it
.
I
scolded
him
for
it
,
but
he
argued
quietly
that
it
*NL*
was
very
good
and
very
wholesome
;
that
it
was
life
,
strong
life
,
and
*NL*
gave
life
to
him
.
This
gave
me
an
idea
,
or
the
rudiment
of
one
.
I
must
*NL*
watch
how
he
gets
rid
of
his
spiders
.
He
has
evidently
some
deep
problem
*NL*
in
his
mind
,
for
he
keeps
a
little
note-book
in
which
he
is
always
*NL*
jotting
down
something
.
Whole
pages
of
it
are
filled
with
masses
of
*NL*
figures
,
generally
single
numbers
added
up
in
batches
,
and
then
the
*NL*
totals
added
in
batches
again
,
as
though
he
were
``
focussing
''
some
*NL*
account
,
as
the
auditors
put
it
.

_
--
There
is
a
method
in
his
madness
,
and
the
rudimentary
idea
in
*NL*
my
mind
is
growing
.
It
will
be
a
whole
idea
soon
,
and
then
,
oh
,
*NL*
unconscious
cerebration
!
you
will
have
to
give
the
wall
to
your
*NL*
conscious
brother
.
I
kept
away
from
my
friend
for
a
few
days
,
so
that
I
*NL*
might
notice
if
there
were
any
change
.
Things
remain
as
they
were
except
*NL*
that
he
has
parted
with
some
of
his
pets
and
got
a
new
one
.
He
has
*NL*
managed
to
get
a
sparrow
,
and
has
already
partially
tamed
it
.
His
means
*NL*
of
taming
is
simple
,
for
already
the
spiders
have
diminished
.
Those
that
*NL*
do
remain
,
however
,
are
well
fed
,
for
he
still
brings
in
the
flies
by
*NL*
tempting
them
with
his
food
.

We
are
progressing
.
My
friend
has
now
a
whole
colony
of
*NL*
sparrows
,
and
his
flies
and
spiders
are
almost
obliterated
.
When
I
came
*NL*
in
he
ran
to
me
and
said
he
wanted
to
ask
me
a
great
favour
--
a
very
,
*NL*
very
great
favour
;
and
as
he
spoke
he
fawned
on
me
like
a
dog
.
I
asked
*NL*
him
what
it
was
,
and
he
said
,
with
a
sort
of
rapture
in
his
voice
and
*NL*
bearing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
kitten
,
a
nice
little
,
sleek
playful
kitten
,
that
I
can
play
with
,
*NL*
and
teach
,
and
feed
--
and
feed
--
and
feed
!
''
I
was
not
unprepared
for
this
*NL*
request
,
for
I
had
noticed
how
his
pets
went
on
increasing
in
size
and
*NL*
vivacity
,
but
I
did
not
care
that
his
pretty
family
of
tame
sparrows
*NL*
should
be
wiped
out
in
the
same
manner
as
the
flies
and
the
spiders
;
so
*NL*
I
said
I
would
see
about
it
,
and
asked
him
if
he
would
not
rather
have
a
*NL*
cat
than
a
kitten
.
His
eagerness
betrayed
him
as
he
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
would
like
a
cat
!
I
only
asked
for
a
kitten
lest
you
should
*NL*
refuse
me
a
cat
.
No
one
would
refuse
me
a
kitten
,
would
they
?
''
I
shook
*NL*
my
head
,
and
said
that
at
present
I
feared
it
would
not
be
possible
,
but
*NL*
that
I
would
see
about
it
.
His
face
fell
,
and
I
could
see
a
warning
of
*NL*
danger
in
it
,
for
there
was
a
sudden
fierce
,
sidelong
look
which
meant
*NL*
killing
.
The
man
is
an
undeveloped
homicidal
maniac
.
I
shall
test
him
*NL*
with
his
present
craving
and
see
how
it
will
work
out
;
then
I
shall
know
*NL*
more
.

_
10
p.
m.
_
--
I
have
visited
him
again
and
found
him
sitting
in
a
corner
*NL*
brooding
.
When
I
came
in
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
me
and
*NL*
implored
me
to
let
him
have
a
cat
;
that
his
salvation
depended
upon
it
.
*NL*
I
was
firm
,
however
,
and
told
him
that
he
could
not
have
it
,
whereupon
*NL*
he
went
without
a
word
,
and
sat
down
,
gnawing
his
fingers
,
in
the
corner
*NL*
where
I
had
found
him
.
I
shall
see
him
in
the
morning
early

Visited
Renfield
very
early
,
before
the
attendant
went
his
*NL*
rounds
.
Found
him
up
and
humming
a
tune
.
He
was
spreading
out
his
sugar
,
*NL*
which
he
had
saved
,
in
the
window
,
and
was
manifestly
beginning
his
*NL*
fly-catching
again
;
and
beginning
it
cheerfully
and
with
a
good
grace
.
I
*NL*
looked
around
for
his
birds
,
and
not
seeing
them
,
asked
him
where
they
*NL*
were
.
He
replied
,
without
turning
round
,
that
they
had
all
flown
away
.
*NL*
There
were
a
few
feathers
about
the
room
and
on
his
pillow
a
drop
of
*NL*
blood
.
I
said
nothing
,
but
went
and
told
the
keeper
to
report
to
me
if
*NL*
there
were
anything
odd
about
him
during
the
day
.

The
attendant
has
just
been
to
me
to
say
that
Renfield
has
*NL*
been
very
sick
and
has
disgorged
a
whole
lot
of
feathers
.
``
My
belief
is
,
*NL*
doctor
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
he
has
eaten
his
birds
,
and
that
he
just
took
*NL*
and
ate
them
raw
!

I
gave
Renfield
a
strong
opiate
to-night
,
enough
to
make
*NL*
even
him
sleep
,
and
took
away
his
pocket-book
to
look
at
it
.
The
thought
*NL*
that
has
been
buzzing
about
my
brain
lately
is
complete
,
and
the
theory
*NL*
proved
.
My
homicidal
maniac
is
of
a
peculiar
kind
.
I
shall
have
to
*NL*
invent
a
new
classification
for
him
,
and
call
him
a
zooephagous
*NL*
-LRB-
life-eating
-RRB-
maniac
;
what
he
desires
is
to
absorb
as
many
lives
as
he
*NL*
can
,
and
he
has
laid
himself
out
to
achieve
it
in
a
cumulative
way
.
He
*NL*
gave
many
flies
to
one
spider
and
many
spiders
to
one
bird
,
and
then
*NL*
wanted
a
cat
to
eat
the
many
birds
.
What
would
have
been
his
later
*NL*
steps
?
It
would
almost
be
worth
while
to
complete
the
experiment
.
It
*NL*
might
be
done
if
there
were
only
a
sufficient
cause
.
Men
sneered
at
*NL*
vivisection
,
and
yet
look
at
its
results
to-day
!
Why
not
advance
science
*NL*
in
its
most
difficult
and
vital
aspect
--
the
knowledge
of
the
brain
?
Had
*NL*
I
even
the
secret
of
one
such
mind
--
did
I
hold
the
key
to
the
fancy
of
*NL*
even
one
lunatic
--
I
might
advance
my
own
branch
of
science
to
a
pitch
*NL*
compared
with
which
Burdon-Sanderson
's
physiology
or
Ferrier
's
*NL*
brain-knowledge
would
be
as
nothing
.
If
only
there
were
a
sufficient
*NL*
cause
!
I
must
not
think
too
much
of
this
,
or
I
may
be
tempted
;
a
good
*NL*
cause
might
turn
the
scale
with
me
,
for
may
not
I
too
be
of
an
*NL*
exceptional
brain
,
congenitally
?
*NL*
*NL*
How
well
the
man
reasoned
;
lunatics
always
do
within
their
own
scope
.
I
*NL*
wonder
at
how
many
lives
he
values
a
man
,
or
if
at
only
one
.
He
has
*NL*
closed
the
account
most
accurately
,
and
to-day
begun
a
new
record
.
How
*NL*
many
of
us
begin
a
new
record
with
each
day
of
our
lives
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
me
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
my
whole
life
ended
with
my
new
hope
,
*NL*
and
that
truly
I
began
a
new
record
.
So
it
will
be
until
the
Great
*NL*
Recorder
sums
me
up
and
closes
my
ledger
account
with
a
balance
to
*NL*
profit
or
loss
.
Oh
,
Lucy
,
Lucy
,
I
can
not
be
angry
with
you
,
nor
can
I
be
*NL*
angry
with
my
friend
whose
happiness
is
yours
;
but
I
must
only
wait
on
*NL*
hopeless
and
work
.
Work
!
work
!
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
only
could
have
as
strong
a
cause
as
my
poor
mad
friend
there
--
a
*NL*
good
,
unselfish
cause
to
make
me
work
--
that
would
be
indeed
happiness
.

--
I
am
anxious
,
and
it
soothes
me
to
express
myself
here
;
it
*NL*
is
like
whispering
to
one
's
self
and
listening
at
the
same
time
.
And
*NL*
there
is
also
something
about
the
shorthand
symbols
that
makes
it
*NL*
different
from
writing
.
I
am
unhappy
about
Lucy
and
about
Jonathan
.
I
*NL*
had
not
heard
from
Jonathan
for
some
time
,
and
was
very
concerned
;
but
*NL*
yesterday
dear
Mr.
Hawkins
,
who
is
always
so
kind
,
sent
me
a
letter
from
*NL*
him
.
I
had
written
asking
him
if
he
had
heard
,
and
he
said
the
enclosed
*NL*
had
just
been
received
.
It
is
only
a
line
dated
from
Castle
Dracula
,
*NL*
and
says
that
he
is
just
starting
for
home
.
That
is
not
like
Jonathan
;
*NL*
I
do
not
understand
it
,
and
it
makes
me
uneasy
.
Then
,
too
,
Lucy
,
*NL*
although
she
is
so
well
,
has
lately
taken
to
her
old
habit
of
walking
in
*NL*
her
sleep
.
Her
mother
has
spoken
to
me
about
it
,
and
we
have
decided
*NL*
that
I
am
to
lock
the
door
of
our
room
every
night
.
Mrs.
Westenra
has
*NL*
got
an
idea
that
sleep-walkers
always
go
out
on
roofs
of
houses
and
*NL*
along
the
edges
of
cliffs
and
then
get
suddenly
wakened
and
fall
over
*NL*
with
a
despairing
cry
that
echoes
all
over
the
place
.
Poor
dear
,
she
is
*NL*
naturally
anxious
about
Lucy
,
and
she
tells
me
that
her
husband
,
Lucy
's
*NL*
father
,
had
the
same
habit
;
that
he
would
get
up
in
the
night
and
dress
*NL*
himself
and
go
out
,
if
he
were
not
stopped
.
Lucy
is
to
be
married
in
the
*NL*
autumn
,
and
she
is
already
planning
out
her
dresses
and
how
her
house
is
*NL*
to
be
arranged
.
I
sympathise
with
her
,
for
I
do
the
same
,
only
Jonathan
*NL*
and
I
will
start
in
life
in
a
very
simple
way
,
and
shall
have
to
try
to
*NL*
make
both
ends
meet
.
Mr.
Holmwood
--
he
is
the
Hon.
Arthur
Holmwood
,
only
*NL*
son
of
Lord
Godalming
--
is
coming
up
here
very
shortly
--
as
soon
as
he
can
*NL*
leave
town
,
for
his
father
is
not
very
well
,
and
I
think
dear
Lucy
is
*NL*
counting
the
moments
till
he
comes
.
She
wants
to
take
him
up
to
the
seat
*NL*
on
the
churchyard
cliff
and
show
him
the
beauty
of
Whitby
.
I
daresay
it
*NL*
is
the
waiting
which
disturbs
her
;
she
will
be
all
right
when
he
*NL*
arrives
.

No
news
from
Jonathan
.
I
am
getting
quite
uneasy
about
him
,
*NL*
though
why
I
should
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
do
wish
that
he
would
write
,
if
*NL*
it
were
only
a
single
line
.
Lucy
walks
more
than
ever
,
and
each
night
I
*NL*
am
awakened
by
her
moving
about
the
room
.
Fortunately
,
the
weather
is
so
*NL*
hot
that
she
can
not
get
cold
;
but
still
the
anxiety
and
the
perpetually
*NL*
being
wakened
is
beginning
to
tell
on
me
,
and
I
am
getting
nervous
and
*NL*
wakeful
myself
.
Thank
God
,
Lucy
's
health
keeps
up
.
Mr.
Holmwood
has
been
*NL*
suddenly
called
to
Ring
to
see
his
father
,
who
has
been
taken
seriously
*NL*
ill
.
Lucy
frets
at
the
postponement
of
seeing
him
,
but
it
does
not
touch
*NL*
her
looks
;
she
is
a
trifle
stouter
,
and
her
cheeks
are
a
lovely
*NL*
rose-pink
.
She
has
lost
that
anaemic
look
which
she
had
.
I
pray
it
will
*NL*
all
last
.

Another
week
gone
,
and
no
news
from
Jonathan
,
not
even
to
*NL*
Mr.
Hawkins
,
from
whom
I
have
heard
.
Oh
,
I
do
hope
he
is
not
ill
.
He
*NL*
surely
would
have
written
.
I
look
at
that
last
letter
of
his
,
but
*NL*
somehow
it
does
not
satisfy
me
.
It
does
not
read
like
him
,
and
yet
it
is
*NL*
his
writing
.
There
is
no
mistake
of
that
.
Lucy
has
not
walked
much
in
*NL*
her
sleep
the
last
week
,
but
there
is
an
odd
concentration
about
her
*NL*
which
I
do
not
understand
;
even
in
her
sleep
she
seems
to
be
watching
*NL*
me
.
She
tries
the
door
,
and
finding
it
locked
,
goes
about
the
room
*NL*
searching
for
the
key
.

_
6
August

_
--
Another
three
days
,
and
no
news
.
This
suspense
is
getting
*NL*
dreadful
.
If
I
only
knew
where
to
write
to
or
where
to
go
to
,
I
should
*NL*
feel
easier
;
but
no
one
has
heard
a
word
of
Jonathan
since
that
last
*NL*
letter
.
I
must
only
pray
to
God
for
patience
.
Lucy
is
more
excitable
*NL*
than
ever
,
but
is
otherwise
well
.
Last
night
was
very
threatening
,
and
*NL*
the
fishermen
say
that
we
are
in
for
a
storm
.
I
must
try
to
watch
it
and
*NL*
learn
the
weather
signs
.
To-day
is
a
grey
day
,
and
the
sun
as
I
write
is
*NL*
hidden
in
thick
clouds
,
high
over
Kettleness
.
Everything
is
grey
--
except
*NL*
the
green
grass
,
which
seems
like
emerald
amongst
it
;
grey
earthy
rock
;
*NL*
grey
clouds
,
tinged
with
the
sunburst
at
the
far
edge
,
hang
over
the
*NL*
grey
sea
,
into
which
the
sand-points
stretch
like
grey
fingers
.
The
sea
*NL*
is
tumbling
in
over
the
shallows
and
the
sandy
flats
with
a
roar
,
*NL*
muffled
in
the
sea-mists
drifting
inland
.
The
horizon
is
lost
in
a
grey
*NL*
mist
.
All
is
vastness
;
the
clouds
are
piled
up
like
giant
rocks
,
and
*NL*
there
is
a
``
brool
''
over
the
sea
that
sounds
like
some
presage
of
doom
.
*NL*
Dark
figures
are
on
the
beach
here
and
there
,
sometimes
half
shrouded
in
*NL*
the
mist
,
and
seem
``
men
like
trees
walking
.
''
The
fishing-boats
are
*NL*
racing
for
home
,
and
rise
and
dip
in
the
ground
swell
as
they
sweep
into
*NL*
the
harbour
,
bending
to
the
scuppers
.
Here
comes
old
Mr.
Swales
.
He
is
*NL*
making
straight
for
me
,
and
I
can
see
,
by
the
way
he
lifts
his
hat
,
that
*NL*
he
wants
to
talk
...
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
been
quite
touched
by
the
change
in
the
poor
old
man
.
When
he
sat
*NL*
down
beside
me
,
he
said
in
a
very
gentle
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
say
something
to
you
,
miss
.
''
I
could
see
he
was
not
at
ease
,
*NL*
so
I
took
his
poor
old
wrinkled
hand
in
mine
and
asked
him
to
speak
*NL*
fully
;
so
he
said
,
leaving
his
hand
in
mine
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
,
my
deary
,
that
I
must
have
shocked
you
by
all
the
wicked
*NL*
things
I
've
been
sayin
'
about
the
dead
,
and
such
like
,
for
weeks
past
;
*NL*
but
I
did
n't
mean
them
,
and
I
want
ye
to
remember
that
when
I
'm
gone
.
We
*NL*
aud
folks
that
be
daffled
,
and
with
one
foot
abaft
the
krok-hooal
,
do
n't
*NL*
altogether
like
to
think
of
it
,
and
we
do
n't
want
to
feel
scart
of
it
;
*NL*
an
'
that
's
why
I
've
took
to
makin
'
light
of
it
,
so
that
I
'd
cheer
up
my
*NL*
own
heart
a
bit
.
But
,
Lord
love
ye
,
miss
,
I
ai
n't
afraid
of
dyin
'
,
not
a
*NL*
bit
;
only
I
do
n't
want
to
die
if
I
can
help
it
.
My
time
must
be
nigh
at
*NL*
hand
now
,
for
I
be
aud
,
and
a
hundred
years
is
too
much
for
any
man
to
*NL*
expect
;
and
I
'm
so
nigh
it
that
the
Aud
Man
is
already
whettin
'
his
*NL*
scythe
.
Ye
see
,
I
ca
n't
get
out
o
'
the
habit
of
caffin
'
about
it
all
at
*NL*
once
;
the
chafts
will
wag
as
they
be
used
to
.
Some
day
soon
the
Angel
of
*NL*
Death
will
sound
his
trumpet
for
me
.
But
do
n't
ye
dooal
an

greet

my
*NL*
deary

''
--
for
he
saw
that
I
was
crying
--
``
if
he
should
come
this
very
*NL*
night
I
'd
not
refuse
to
answer
his
call

For

,
after
all
,
only
a

waitin

for
somethin'
else
than
what
we
're
doin

;
and
death
be
all
that
*NL*
we
can
rightly
depend
on
.
But
I
'm
content

for
it
's
comin

and
comin

It
may
be
comin

Maybe
it
's
in

wind
out
over
the
sea
that
's
bringin

with
*NL*
it
loss
and
wreck

and
sore
distress

and
sad

he

cried
suddenly
.
``
There
's
something
in

in

hoast
beyont

I

make

cheerful
when

He
held
up
his
arms
devoutly
,
and
raised
his
hat
.
His
mouth
*NL*
moved
as
though
he
were
praying
.
After
a
few
minutes

silence
,
he
got
*NL*
up
,
shook
hands
with
me
,
and
blessed
me
,
and
said
good-bye
,
and
hobbled
*NL*
off
.
It
all
touched
me
,
and
upset
me
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
glad
when
the
coastguard
came
along
,
with
his
spy-glass
under
his
*NL*
arm
.
He
stopped
to
talk
with
me
,
as
he
always
does
,
but
all
the
time
*NL*
kept
looking
at
a
strange
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
make
her
out
,
''
he
said
;
``
she
's
a
Russian
,
by
the
look
of
her
;
*NL*
but
she
's
knocking
about
in
the
queerest
way
.
She
does
n't
know
her
mind
*NL*
a
bit
;
she
seems
to
see
the
storm
coming
,
but
ca
n't
decide
whether
to
*NL*
run
up
north
in
the
open
,
or
to
put
in
here
.
Look
there
again
!
She
is
*NL*
steered
mighty
strangely
,
for
she
does
n't
mind
the
hand
on
the
wheel
;
*NL*
changes
about
with
every
puff
of
wind
.
We
'll
hear
more
of
her
before
*NL*
this
time
to-morrow
.

*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
greatest
and
suddenest
storms
on
record
has
just
been
*NL*
experienced
here
,
with
results
both
strange
and
unique
.
The
weather
had
*NL*
been
somewhat
sultry
,
but
not
to
any
degree
uncommon
in
the
month
of
*NL*
August
.
Saturday
evening
was
as
fine
as
was
ever
known
,
and
the
great
*NL*
body
of
holiday-makers
laid
out
yesterday
for
visits
to
Mulgrave
Woods
,
*NL*
Robin
Hood
's
Bay
,
Rig
Mill
,
Runswick
,
Staithes
,
and
the
various
trips
in
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
of
Whitby
.
The
steamers
_
Emma
_
and
_
Scarborough
_
made
*NL*
trips
up
and
down
the
coast
,
and
there
was
an
unusual
amount
of
*NL*
``
tripping
''
both
to
and
from
Whitby
.
The
day
was
unusually
fine
till
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
when
some
of
the
gossips
who
frequent
the
East
Cliff
*NL*
churchyard
,
and
from
that
commanding
eminence
watch
the
wide
sweep
of
*NL*
sea
visible
to
the
north
and
east
,
called
attention
to
a
sudden
show
of
*NL*
``
mares
'
-
tails
''
high
in
the
sky
to
the
north-west
.
The
wind
was
then
*NL*
blowing
from
the
south-west
in
the
mild
degree
which
in
barometrical
*NL*
language
is
ranked
``
No.
2
:
light
breeze
.
''
The
coastguard
on
duty
at
once
*NL*
made
report
,
and
one
old
fisherman
,
who
for
more
than
half
a
century
has
*NL*
kept
watch
on
weather
signs
from
the
East
Cliff
,
foretold
in
an
emphatic
*NL*
manner
the
coming
of
a
sudden
storm
.
The
approach
of
sunset
was
so
very
*NL*
beautiful
,
so
grand
in
its
masses
of
splendidly-coloured
clouds
,
that
*NL*
there
was
quite
an
assemblage
on
the
walk
along
the
cliff
in
the
old
*NL*
churchyard
to
enjoy
the
beauty
.
Before
the
sun
dipped
below
the
black
*NL*
mass
of
Kettleness
,
standing
boldly
athwart
the
western
sky
,
its
*NL*
downward
way
was
marked
by
myriad
clouds
of
every
sunset-colour
--
flame
,
*NL*
purple
,
pink
,
green
,
violet
,
and
all
the
tints
of
gold
;
with
here
and
*NL*
there
masses
not
large
,
but
of
seemingly
absolute
blackness
,
in
all
*NL*
sorts
of
shapes
,
as
well
outlined
as
colossal
silhouettes
.
The
*NL*
experience
was
not
lost
on
the
painters
,
and
doubtless
some
of
the
*NL*
sketches
of
the
``
Prelude
to
the
Great
Storm
''
will
grace
the
R.
A.
and
R.
*NL*
I.
walls
in
May
next
.
More
than
one
captain
made
up
his
mind
then
and
*NL*
there
that
his
``
cobble
''
or
his
``
mule
,
''
as
they
term
the
different
*NL*
classes
of
boats
,
would
remain
in
the
harbour
till
the
storm
had
passed
.
*NL*
The
wind
fell
away
entirely
during
the
evening
,
and
at
midnight
there
*NL*
was
a
dead
calm
,
a
sultry
heat
,
and
that
prevailing
intensity
which
,
on
*NL*
the
approach
of
thunder
,
affects
persons
of
a
sensitive
nature
.
There
*NL*
were
but
few
lights
in
sight
at
sea
,
for
even
the
coasting
steamers
,
*NL*
which
usually
``
hug
''
the
shore
so
closely
,
kept
well
to
seaward
,
and
but
*NL*
few
fishing-boats
were
in
sight
.
The
only
sail
noticeable
was
a
foreign
*NL*
schooner
with
all
sails
set
,
which
was
seemingly
going
westwards
.
The
*NL*
foolhardiness
or
ignorance
of
her
officers
was
a
prolific
theme
for
*NL*
comment
whilst
she
remained
in
sight
,
and
efforts
were
made
to
signal
*NL*
her
to
reduce
sail
in
face
of
her
danger
.
Before
the
night
shut
down
she
*NL*
was
seen
with
sails
idly
flapping
as
she
gently
rolled
on
the
undulating
*NL*
swell
of
the
sea
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
idle
as
a
painted
ship
upon
a
painted
ocean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
before
ten
o'clock
the
stillness
of
the
air
grew
quite
*NL*
oppressive
,
and
the
silence
was
so
marked
that
the
bleating
of
a
sheep
*NL*
inland
or
the
barking
of
a
dog
in
the
town
was
distinctly
heard
,
and
the
*NL*
band
on
the
pier
,
with
its
lively
French
air
,
was
like
a
discord
in
the
*NL*
great
harmony
of
nature
's
silence
.
A
little
after
midnight
came
a
*NL*
strange
sound
from
over
the
sea
,
and
high
overhead
the
air
began
to
*NL*
carry
a
strange
,
faint
,
hollow
booming
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
without
warning
the
tempest
broke
.
With
a
rapidity
which
,
at
the
*NL*
time
,
seemed
incredible
,
and
even
afterwards
is
impossible
to
realize
,
*NL*
the
whole
aspect
of
nature
at
once
became
convulsed
.
The
waves
rose
in
*NL*
growing
fury
,
each
overtopping
its
fellow
,
till
in
a
very
few
minutes
*NL*
the
lately
glassy
sea
was
like
a
roaring
and
devouring
monster
.
*NL*
White-crested
waves
beat
madly
on
the
level
sands
and
rushed
up
the
*NL*
shelving
cliffs
;
others
broke
over
the
piers
,
and
with
their
spume
swept
*NL*
the
lanthorns
of
the
lighthouses
which
rise
from
the
end
of
either
pier
*NL*
of
Whitby
Harbour
.
The
wind
roared
like
thunder
,
and
blew
with
such
*NL*
force
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
even
strong
men
kept
their
feet
,
*NL*
or
clung
with
grim
clasp
to
the
iron
stanchions
.
It
was
found
necessary
*NL*
to
clear
the
entire
piers
from
the
mass
of
onlookers
,
or
else
the
*NL*
fatalities
of
the
night
would
have
been
increased
manifold
.
To
add
to
*NL*
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
the
time
,
masses
of
sea-fog
came
*NL*
drifting
inland
--
white
,
wet
clouds
,
which
swept
by
in
ghostly
fashion
,
*NL*
so
dank
and
damp
and
cold
that
it
needed
but
little
effort
of
*NL*
imagination
to
think
that
the
spirits
of
those
lost
at
sea
were
*NL*
touching
their
living
brethren
with
the
clammy
hands
of
death
,
and
many
*NL*
a
one
shuddered
as
the
wreaths
of
sea-mist
swept
by
.
At
times
the
mist
*NL*
cleared
,
and
the
sea
for
some
distance
could
be
seen
in
the
glare
of
the
*NL*
lightning
,
which
now
came
thick
and
fast
,
followed
by
such
sudden
peals
*NL*
of
thunder
that
the
whole
sky
overhead
seemed
trembling
under
the
shock
*NL*
of
the
footsteps
of
the
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
scenes
thus
revealed
were
of
immeasurable
grandeur
and
of
*NL*
absorbing
interest
--
the
sea
,
running
mountains
high
,
threw
skywards
with
*NL*
each
wave
mighty
masses
of
white
foam
,
which
the
tempest
seemed
to
*NL*
snatch
at
and
whirl
away
into
space
;
here
and
there
a
fishing-boat
,
with
*NL*
a
rag
of
sail
,
running
madly
for
shelter
before
the
blast
;
now
and
again
*NL*
the
white
wings
of
a
storm-tossed
sea-bird
.
On
the
summit
of
the
East
*NL*
Cliff
the
new
searchlight
was
ready
for
experiment
,
but
had
not
yet
been
*NL*
tried
.
The
officers
in
charge
of
it
got
it
into
working
order
,
and
in
*NL*
the
pauses
of
the
inrushing
mist
swept
with
it
the
surface
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
Once
or
twice
its
service
was
most
effective
,
as
when
a
fishing-boat
,
*NL*
with
gunwale
under
water
,
rushed
into
the
harbour
,
able
,
by
the
guidance
*NL*
of
the
sheltering
light
,
to
avoid
the
danger
of
dashing
against
the
*NL*
piers
.
As
each
boat
achieved
the
safety
of
the
port
there
was
a
shout
of
*NL*
joy
from
the
mass
of
people
on
shore
,
a
shout
which
for
a
moment
seemed
*NL*
to
cleave
the
gale
and
was
then
swept
away
in
its
rush
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
long
the
searchlight
discovered
some
distance
away
a
schooner
*NL*
with
all
sails
set
,
apparently
the
same
vessel
which
had
been
noticed
*NL*
earlier
in
the
evening
.
The
wind
had
by
this
time
backed
to
the
east
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
shudder
amongst
the
watchers
on
the
cliff
as
they
*NL*
realized
the
terrible
danger
in
which
she
now
was
.
Between
her
and
the
*NL*
port
lay
the
great
flat
reef
on
which
so
many
good
ships
have
from
time
*NL*
to
time
suffered
,
and
,
with
the
wind
blowing
from
its
present
quarter
,
*NL*
it
would
be
quite
impossible
that
she
should
fetch
the
entrance
of
the
*NL*
harbour
.
It
was
now
nearly
the
hour
of
high
tide
,
but
the
waves
were
so
*NL*
great
that
in
their
troughs
the
shallows
of
the
shore
were
almost
*NL*
visible
,
and
the
schooner
,
with
all
sails
set
,
was
rushing
with
such
*NL*
speed
that
,
in
the
words
of
one
old
salt
,
``
she
must
fetch
up
somewhere
,
*NL*
if
it
was
only
in
hell
.
''
Then
came
another
rush
of
sea-fog
,
greater
than
*NL*
any
hitherto
--
a
mass
of
dank
mist
,
which
seemed
to
close
on
all
things
*NL*
like
a
grey
pall
,
and
left
available
to
men
only
the
organ
of
hearing
,
*NL*
for
the
roar
of
the
tempest
,
and
the
crash
of
the
thunder
,
and
the
*NL*
booming
of
the
mighty
billows
came
through
the
damp
oblivion
even
louder
*NL*
than
before
.
The
rays
of
the
searchlight
were
kept
fixed
on
the
harbour
*NL*
mouth
across
the
East
Pier
,
where
the
shock
was
expected
,
and
men
waited
*NL*
breathless
.
The
wind
suddenly
shifted
to
the
north-east
,
and
the
remnant
*NL*
of
the
sea-fog
melted
in
the
blast
;
and
then
,
_
mirabile
dictu
_
,
between
*NL*
the
piers
,
leaping
from
wave
to
wave
as
it
rushed
at
headlong
speed
,
*NL*
swept
the
strange
schooner
before
the
blast
,
with
all
sail
set
,
and
*NL*
gained
the
safety
of
the
harbour
.
The
searchlight
followed
her
,
and
a
*NL*
shudder
ran
through
all
who
saw
her
,
for
lashed
to
the
helm
was
a
*NL*
corpse
,
with
drooping
head
,
which
swung
horribly
to
and
fro
at
each
*NL*
motion
of
the
ship
.
No
other
form
could
be
seen
on
deck
at
all
.
A
great
*NL*
awe
came
on
all
as
they
realised
that
the
ship
,
as
if
by
a
miracle
,
had
*NL*
found
the
harbour
,
unsteered
save
by
the
hand
of
a
dead
man
!
However
,
*NL*
all
took
place
more
quickly
than
it
takes
to
write
these
words
.
The
*NL*
schooner
paused
not
,
but
rushing
across
the
harbour
,
pitched
herself
on
*NL*
that
accumulation
of
sand
and
gravel
washed
by
many
tides
and
many
*NL*
storms
into
the
south-east
corner
of
the
pier
jutting
under
the
East
*NL*
Cliff
,
known
locally
as
Tate
Hill
Pier
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
of
course
a
considerable
concussion
as
the
vessel
drove
up
on
*NL*
the
sand
heap
.
Every
spar
,
rope
,
and
stay
was
strained
,
and
some
of
the
*NL*
``
top-hammer
''
came
crashing
down
.
But
,
strangest
of
all
,
the
very
instant
*NL*
the
shore
was
touched
,
an
immense
dog
sprang
up
on
deck
from
below
,
as
*NL*
if
shot
up
by
the
concussion
,
and
running
forward
,
jumped
from
the
bow
*NL*
on
the
sand
.
Making
straight
for
the
steep
cliff
,
where
the
churchyard
*NL*
hangs
over
the
laneway
to
the
East
Pier
so
steeply
that
some
of
the
flat
*NL*
tombstones
--
``
thruff-steans
''
or
``
through-stones
,
''
as
they
call
them
in
*NL*
the
Whitby
vernacular
--
actually
project
over
where
the
sustaining
cliff
*NL*
has
fallen
away
,
it
disappeared
in
the
darkness
,
which
seemed
*NL*
intensified
just
beyond
the
focus
of
the
searchlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
there
was
no
one
at
the
moment
on
Tate
Hill
Pier
,
as
*NL*
all
those
whose
houses
are
in
close
proximity
were
either
in
bed
or
were
*NL*
out
on
the
heights
above
.
Thus
the
coastguard
on
duty
on
the
eastern
*NL*
side
of
the
harbour
,
who
at
once
ran
down
to
the
little
pier
,
was
the
*NL*
first
to
climb
on
board
.
The
men
working
the
searchlight
,
after
scouring
*NL*
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
without
seeing
anything
,
then
turned
the
*NL*
light
on
the
derelict
and
kept
it
there
.
The
coastguard
ran
aft
,
and
*NL*
when
he
came
beside
the
wheel
,
bent
over
to
examine
it
,
and
recoiled
at
*NL*
once
as
though
under
some
sudden
emotion
.
This
seemed
to
pique
general
*NL*
curiosity
,
and
quite
a
number
of
people
began
to
run
.
It
is
a
good
way
*NL*
round
from
the
West
Cliff
by
the
Drawbridge
to
Tate
Hill
Pier
,
but
your
*NL*
correspondent
is
a
fairly
good
runner
,
and
came
well
ahead
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
When
I
arrived
,
however
,
I
found
already
assembled
on
the
pier
a
crowd
,
*NL*
whom
the
coastguard
and
police
refused
to
allow
to
come
on
board
.
By
the
*NL*
courtesy
of
the
chief
boatman
,
I
was
,
as
your
correspondent
,
permitted
*NL*
to
climb
on
deck
,
and
was
one
of
a
small
group
who
saw
the
dead
seaman
*NL*
whilst
actually
lashed
to
the
wheel
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
wonder
that
the
coastguard
was
surprised
,
or
even
awed
,
for
*NL*
not
often
can
such
a
sight
have
been
seen
.
The
man
was
simply
fastened
*NL*
by
his
hands
,
tied
one
over
the
other
,
to
a
spoke
of
the
wheel
.
Between
*NL*
the
inner
hand
and
the
wood
was
a
crucifix
,
the
set
of
beads
on
which
it
*NL*
was
fastened
being
around
both
wrists
and
wheel
,
and
all
kept
fast
by
*NL*
the
binding
cords
.
The
poor
fellow
may
have
been
seated
at
one
time
,
but
*NL*
the
flapping
and
buffeting
of
the
sails
had
worked
through
the
rudder
of
*NL*
the
wheel
and
dragged
him
to
and
fro
,
so
that
the
cords
with
which
he
*NL*
was
tied
had
cut
the
flesh
to
the
bone
.
Accurate
note
was
made
of
the
*NL*
state
of
things
,
and
a
doctor
--
Surgeon
J.
M.
Caffyn
,
of
33
,
East
Elliot
*NL*
Place
--
who
came
immediately
after
me
,
declared
,
after
making
*NL*
examination
,
that
the
man
must
have
been
dead
for
quite
two
days
.
In
his
*NL*
pocket
was
a
bottle
,
carefully
corked
,
empty
save
for
a
little
roll
of
*NL*
paper
,
which
proved
to
be
the
addendum
to
the
log
.
The
coastguard
said
*NL*
the
man
must
have
tied
up
his
own
hands
,
fastening
the
knots
with
his
*NL*
teeth
.
The
fact
that
a
coastguard
was
the
first
on
board
may
save
some
*NL*
complications
,
later
on
,
in
the
Admiralty
Court
;
for
coastguards
can
not
*NL*
claim
the
salvage
which
is
the
right
of
the
first
civilian
entering
on
a
*NL*
derelict
.
Already
,
however
,
the
legal
tongues
are
wagging
,
and
one
young
*NL*
law
student
is
loudly
asserting
that
the
rights
of
the
owner
are
already
*NL*
completely
sacrificed
,
his
property
being
held
in
contravention
of
the
*NL*
statutes
of
mortmain
,
since
the
tiller
,
as
emblemship
,
if
not
proof
,
of
*NL*
delegated
possession
,
is
held
in
a
_
dead
hand
_
.
It
is
needless
to
say
*NL*
that
the
dead
steersman
has
been
reverently
removed
from
the
place
where
*NL*
he
held
his
honourable
watch
and
ward
till
death
--
a
steadfastness
as
*NL*
noble
as
that
of
the
young
Casabianca
--
and
placed
in
the
mortuary
to
*NL*
await
inquest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Already
the
sudden
storm
is
passing
,
and
its
fierceness
is
abating
;
*NL*
crowds
are
scattering
homeward
,
and
the
sky
is
beginning
to
redden
over
*NL*
the
Yorkshire
wolds
.
I
shall
send
,
in
time
for
your
next
issue
,
further
*NL*
details
of
the
derelict
ship
which
found
her
way
so
miraculously
into
*NL*
harbour
in
the
storm
.

_
--
The
sequel
to
the
strange
arrival
of
the
derelict
in
the
*NL*
storm
last
night
is
almost
more
startling
than
the
thing
itself
.
It
*NL*
turns
out
that
the
schooner
is
a
Russian
from
Varna
,
and
is
called
the
*NL*
_
Demeter
_
.
She
is
almost
entirely
in
ballast
of
silver
sand
,
with
only
a
*NL*
small
amount
of
cargo
--
a
number
of
great
wooden
boxes
filled
with
mould
.
*NL*
This
cargo
was
consigned
to
a
Whitby
solicitor
,
Mr.
S.
F.
Billington
,
of
*NL*
7
,
The
Crescent
,
who
this
morning
went
aboard
and
formally
took
*NL*
possession
of
the
goods
consigned
to
him
.
The
Russian
consul
,
too
,
*NL*
acting
for
the
charter-party
,
took
formal
possession
of
the
ship
,
and
*NL*
paid
all
harbour
dues
,
etc.
.
Nothing
is
talked
about
here
to-day
except
*NL*
the
strange
coincidence
;
the
officials
of
the
Board
of
Trade
have
been
*NL*
most
exacting
in
seeing
that
every
compliance
has
been
made
with
*NL*
existing
regulations
.
As
the
matter
is
to
be
a
``
nine
days
'
wonder
,
''
they
*NL*
are
evidently
determined
that
there
shall
be
no
cause
of
after
*NL*
complaint
.
A
good
deal
of
interest
was
abroad
concerning
the
dog
which
*NL*
landed
when
the
ship
struck
,
and
more
than
a
few
of
the
members
of
the
*NL*
S.
P.
C.
A.
,
which
is
very
strong
in
Whitby
,
have
tried
to
befriend
the
*NL*
animal
.
To
the
general
disappointment
,
however
,
it
was
not
to
be
found
;
*NL*
it
seems
to
have
disappeared
entirely
from
the
town
.
It
may
be
that
it
*NL*
was
frightened
and
made
its
way
on
to
the
moors
,
where
it
is
still
*NL*
hiding
in
terror
.
There
are
some
who
look
with
dread
on
such
a
*NL*
possibility
,
lest
later
on
it
should
in
itself
become
a
danger
,
for
it
*NL*
is
evidently
a
fierce
brute
.
Early
this
morning
a
large
dog
,
a
half-bred
*NL*
mastiff
belonging
to
a
coal
merchant
close
to
Tate
Hill
Pier
,
was
found
*NL*
dead
in
the
roadway
opposite
to
its
master
's
yard
.
It
had
been
fighting
,
*NL*
and
manifestly
had
had
a
savage
opponent
,
for
its
throat
was
torn
away
,
*NL*
and
its
belly
was
slit
open
as
if
with
a
savage
claw
.

_
Later
.
_
--
By
the
kindness
of
the
Board
of
Trade
inspector
,
I
have
been
*NL*
permitted
to
look
over
the
log-book
of
the
_
Demeter
_
,
which
was
in
order
*NL*
up
to
within
three
days
,
but
contained
nothing
of
special
interest
*NL*
except
as
to
facts
of
missing
men
.
The
greatest
interest
,
however
,
is
*NL*
with
regard
to
the
paper
found
in
the
bottle
,
which
was
to-day
produced
*NL*
at
the
inquest
;
and
a
more
strange
narrative
than
the
two
between
them
*NL*
unfold
it
has
not
been
my
lot
to
come
across
.
As
there
is
no
motive
for
*NL*
concealment
,
I
am
permitted
to
use
them
,
and
accordingly
send
you
a
*NL*
rescript
,
simply
omitting
technical
details
of
seamanship
and
*NL*
supercargo
.
It
almost
seems
as
though
the
captain
had
been
seized
with
*NL*
some
kind
of
mania
before
he
had
got
well
into
blue
water
,
and
that
*NL*
this
had
developed
persistently
throughout
the
voyage
.
Of
course
my
*NL*
statement
must
be
taken
_
cum
grano
_
,
since
I
am
writing
from
the
*NL*
dictation
of
a
clerk
of
the
Russian
consul
,
who
kindly
translated
for
*NL*
me

being
short

all
steady

who

sailed
with

before

Mate
could
not
make
out
what
was
wrong
;
they
only
*NL*
told
him
there
was
_
something
_
,
and
crossed
themselves
.
Mate
lost
temper

with

of

that

struck

Expected

watch

last

was
relieved
by

but
did
not
go
to

Men
more

downcast
than
ever

All
said
they
expected
something
of
the
kind
,
but
*NL*
would
not
say
more
than
there
was
_
something

aboard

On
17
July
,
yesterday
,
one
of
the
men
,
Olgaren
,
came
to
my
cabin
,
and
in
*NL*
an
awestruck
way
confided
to
me
that
he
thought
there
was
a
strange
man
*NL*
aboard
the
ship
.
He
said
that
in
his
watch
he
had
been
sheltering
*NL*
behind
the
deck-house
,
as
there
was
a
rain-storm
,
when
he
saw
a
tall
,
*NL*
thin
man
,
who
was
not
like
any
of
the
crew
,
come
up
the
companion-way
,
*NL*
and
go
along
the
deck
forward
,
and
disappear
.
He
followed
cautiously
,
*NL*
but
when
he
got
to
bows
found
no
one
,
and
the
hatchways
were
all
closed
.
*NL*
He
was
in
a
panic
of
superstitious
fear
,
and
I
am
afraid
the
panic
may
*NL*
spread
.
To
allay
it
,
I
shall
to-day
search
entire
ship
carefully
from
*NL*
stem
to
stern
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
day
I
got
together
the
whole
crew
,
and
told
them
,
as
they
*NL*
evidently
thought
there
was
some
one
in
the
ship
,
we
would
search
from
*NL*
stem
to
stern
.
First
mate
angry
;
said
it
was
folly
,
and
to
yield
to
such
*NL*
foolish
ideas
would
demoralise
the
men
;
said
he
would
engage
to
keep
*NL*
them
out
of
trouble
with
a
handspike
.
I
let
him
take
the
helm
,
while
the
*NL*
rest
began
thorough
search
,
all
keeping
abreast
,
with
lanterns
:
we
left
*NL*
no
corner
unsearched
.
As
there
were
only
the
big
wooden
boxes
,
there
*NL*
were
no
odd
corners
where
a
man
could
hide
.
Men
much
relieved
when
*NL*
search
over
,
and
went
back
to
work
cheerfully
.
First
mate
scowled
,
but
*NL*
said
nothing

another
man
lost

disappeared
.
Like
the
first
,
he
came
off
his
*NL*
watch
and
was
not
seen
again
.
Men
all
in
a
panic
of
fear
;
sent
a
round
*NL*
robin
,
asking
to
have
double
watch
,
as
they
fear
to
be
alone
.
Mate
*NL*
angry

Fear
there

No

no

snatch

Raised
outcry

all
came
on

Thorough
search

Are

I
got
to
it
found
no
one
there
.
The
wind
was
steady
,
and
as
we
ran
*NL*
before
it
there
was
no
yawing
.
I
dared
not
leave
it
,
so
shouted
for
the
*NL*
mate
.
After
a
few
seconds
he
rushed
up
on
deck
in
his
flannels
.
He
*NL*
looked
wild-eyed
and
haggard
,
and
I
greatly
fear
his
reason
has
given
*NL*
way
.
He
came
close
to
me
and
whispered
hoarsely
,
with
his
mouth
to
my
*NL*
ear
,
as
though
fearing
the
very
air
might
hear
:
''
_
It
_
is
here
;
I
know
*NL*
it
,
now
.
On
the
watch
last
night
I
saw
It
,
like
a
man
,
tall
and
thin
,
*NL*
and
ghastly
pale
.
It
was
in
the
bows
,
and
looking
out
.
I
crept
behind
*NL*
It
,
and
gave
It
my
knife
;
but
the
knife
went
through
It
,
empty
as
the
*NL*
air
.
''
And
as
he
spoke
he
took
his
knife
and
drove
it
savagely
into
*NL*
space
.
Then
he
went
on
:
``
But
It
is
here
,
and
I
'll
find
It
.
It
is
in
the
*NL*
hold
,
perhaps
in
one
of
those
boxes
.
I
'll
unscrew
them
one
by
one
and
*NL*
see
.
You
work
the
helm
.
''
And
,
with
a
warning
look
and
his
finger
on
his
*NL*
lip
,
he
went
below
.
There
was
springing
up
a
choppy
wind
,
and
I
could
*NL*
not
leave
the
helm
.
I
saw
him
come
out
on
deck
again
with
a
tool-chest
*NL*
and
a
lantern
,
and
go
down
the
forward
hatchway
.
He
is
mad
,
stark
,
*NL*
raving
mad
,
and
it
's
no
use
my
trying
to
stop
him
.
He
ca
n't
hurt
those
*NL*
big
boxes
:
they
are
invoiced
as
``
clay
,
''
and
to
pull
them
about
is
as
*NL*
harmless
a
thing
as
he
can
do
.
So
here
I
stay
,
and
mind
the
helm
,
and
*NL*
write
these
notes
.
I
can
only
trust
in
God
and
wait
till
the
fog
clears
.
*NL*
Then
,
if
I
ca
n't
steer
to
any
harbour
with
the
wind
that
is
,
I
shall
cut
*NL*
down
sails
and
lie
by
,
and
signal
for
help
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
nearly
all
over
now
.
Just
as
I
was
beginning
to
hope
that
the
mate
*NL*
would
come
out
calmer
--
for
I
heard
him
knocking
away
at
something
in
the
*NL*
hold
,
and
work
is
good
for
him
--
there
came
up
the
hatchway
a
sudden
,
*NL*
startled
scream
,
which
made
my
blood
run
cold
,
and
up
on
the
deck
he
*NL*
came
as
if
shot
from
a
gun
--
a
raging
madman
,
with
his
eyes
rolling
and
*NL*
his
face
convulsed
with
fear
.
``
Save
me
!
save
me
!
''
he
cried
,
and
then
*NL*
looked
round
on
the
blanket
of
fog
.
His
horror
turned
to
despair
,
and
in
*NL*
a
steady
voice
he
said
:
``
You
had
better
come
too
,
captain
,
before
it
is
*NL*
too
late
.
_
He
_
is
there
.
I
know
the
secret
now
.
The
sea
will
save
me
*NL*
from
Him
,
and
it
is
all
that
is
left
!
''
Before
I
could
say
a
word
,
or
*NL*
move
forward
to
seize
him
,
he
sprang
on
the
bulwark
and
deliberately
*NL*
threw
himself
into
the
sea
.
I
suppose
I
know
the
secret
too
,
now
.
It
was
*NL*
this
madman
who
had
got
rid
of
the
men
one
by
one
,
and
now
he
has
*NL*
followed
them
himself
.
God
help
me
!
How
am
I
to
account
for
all
these
*NL*
horrors
when
I
get
to
port
?
_
When
_
I
get
to
port
!
Will
that
ever
be
?

_
4
August
.
_
--
Still
fog
,
which
the
sunrise
can
not
pierce
.
I
know
there
is
*NL*
sunrise
because
I
am
a
sailor
,
why
else
I
know
not
.
I
dared
not
go
*NL*
below
,
I
dared
not
leave
the
helm
;
so
here
all
night
I
stayed
,
and
in
*NL*
the
dimness
of
the
night
I
saw
It
--
Him
!
God
forgive
me
,
but
the
mate
was
*NL*
right
to
jump
overboard
.
It
was
better
to
die
like
a
man
;
to
die
like
a
*NL*
sailor
in
blue
water
no
man
can
object
.
But
I
am
captain
,
and
I
must
not
*NL*
leave
my
ship
.
But
I
shall
baffle
this
fiend
or
monster
,
for
I
shall
tie
*NL*
my
hands
to
the
wheel
when
my
strength
begins
to
fail
,
and
along
with
*NL*
them
I
shall
tie
that
which
He
--
It
!
--
dare
not
touch
;
and
then
,
come
good
*NL*
wind
or
foul
,
I
shall
save
my
soul
,
and
my
honour
as
a
captain
.
I
am
*NL*
growing
weaker
,
and
the
night
is
coming
on
.
If
He
can
look
me
in
the
*NL*
face
again
,
I
may
not
have
time
to
act
...
If
we
are
wrecked
,
mayhap
*NL*
this
bottle
may
be
found
,
and
those
who
find
it
may
understand
;
if
not
,
*NL*
...
well
,
then
all
men
shall
know
that
I
have
been
true
to
my
trust
.
God
*NL*
and
the
Blessed
Virgin
and
the
saints
help
a
poor
ignorant
soul
trying
*NL*
to
do
his
duty
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
the
verdict
was
an
open
one
.
There
is
no
evidence
to
adduce
;
*NL*
and
whether
or
not
the
man
himself
committed
the
murders
there
is
now
*NL*
none
to
say
.
The
folk
here
hold
almost
universally
that
the
captain
is
*NL*
simply
a
hero
,
and
he
is
to
be
given
a
public
funeral
.
Already
it
is
*NL*
arranged
that
his
body
is
to
be
taken
with
a
train
of
boats
up
the
Esk
*NL*
for
a
piece
and
then
brought
back
to
Tate
Hill
Pier
and
up
the
abbey
*NL*
steps
;
for
he
is
to
be
buried
in
the
churchyard
on
the
cliff
.
The
owners
*NL*
of
more
than
a
hundred
boats
have
already
given
in
their
names
as
*NL*
wishing
to
follow
him
to
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
trace
has
ever
been
found
of
the
great
dog
;
at
which
there
is
much
*NL*
mourning
,
for
,
with
public
opinion
in
its
present
state
,
he
would
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
be
adopted
by
the
town
.
To-morrow
will
see
the
funeral
;
and
so
*NL*
will
end
this
one
more
``
mystery
of
the
sea
.

--
Lucy
was
very
restless
all
night
,
and
I
,
too
,
could
not
*NL*
sleep
.
The
storm
was
fearful
,
and
as
it
boomed
loudly
among
the
*NL*
chimney-pots
,
it
made
me
shudder
.
When
a
sharp
puff
came
it
seemed
to
be
*NL*
like
a
distant
gun
.
Strangely
enough
,
Lucy
did
not
wake
;
but
she
got
up
*NL*
twice
and
dressed
herself
.
Fortunately
,
each
time
I
awoke
in
time
and
*NL*
managed
to
undress
her
without
waking
her
,
and
got
her
back
to
bed
.
It
*NL*
is
a
very
strange
thing
,
this
sleep-walking
,
for
as
soon
as
her
will
is
*NL*
thwarted
in
any
physical
way
,
her
intention
,
if
there
be
any
,
*NL*
disappears
,
and
she
yields
herself
almost
exactly
to
the
routine
of
her
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
we
both
got
up
and
went
down
to
the
harbour
to
see
*NL*
if
anything
had
happened
in
the
night
.
There
were
very
few
people
about
,
*NL*
and
though
the
sun
was
bright
,
and
the
air
clear
and
fresh
,
the
big
,
*NL*
grim-looking
waves
,
that
seemed
dark
themselves
because
the
foam
that
*NL*
topped
them
was
like
snow
,
forced
themselves
in
through
the
narrow
mouth
*NL*
of
the
harbour
--
like
a
bullying
man
going
through
a
crowd
.
Somehow
I
*NL*
felt
glad
that
Jonathan
was
not
on
the
sea
last
night
,
but
on
land
.
But
,
*NL*
oh
,
is
he
on
land
or
sea
?
Where
is
he
,
and
how
?
I
am
getting
fearfully
*NL*
anxious
about
him
.
If
I
only
knew
what
to
do
,
and
could
do
anything
!

_
10
August
.
_
--
The
funeral
of
the
poor
sea-captain
to-day
was
most
*NL*
touching
.
Every
boat
in
the
harbour
seemed
to
be
there
,
and
the
coffin
*NL*
was
carried
by
captains
all
the
way
from
Tate
Hill
Pier
up
to
the
*NL*
churchyard
.
Lucy
came
with
me
,
and
we
went
early
to
our
old
seat
,
whilst
*NL*
the
cortege
of
boats
went
up
the
river
to
the
Viaduct
and
came
down
*NL*
again
.
We
had
a
lovely
view
,
and
saw
the
procession
nearly
all
the
way
.
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
was
laid
to
rest
quite
near
our
seat
so
that
we
stood
on
*NL*
it
when
the
time
came
and
saw
everything
.
Poor
Lucy
seemed
much
upset
.
*NL*
She
was
restless
and
uneasy
all
the
time
,
and
I
can
not
but
think
that
*NL*
her
dreaming
at
night
is
telling
on
her
.
She
is
quite
odd
in
one
thing
:
*NL*
she
will
not
admit
to
me
that
there
is
any
cause
for
restlessness
;
or
if
*NL*
there
be
,
she
does
not
understand
it
herself
.
There
is
an
additional
*NL*
cause
in
that
poor
old
Mr.
Swales
was
found
dead
this
morning
on
our
*NL*
seat
,
his
neck
being
broken
.
He
had
evidently
,
as
the
doctor
said
,
*NL*
fallen
back
in
the
seat
in
some
sort
of
fright
,
for
there
was
a
look
of
*NL*
fear
and
horror
on
his
face
that
the
men
said
made
them
shudder
.
Poor
*NL*
dear
old
man
!
Perhaps
he
had
seen
Death
with
his
dying
eyes
!
Lucy
is
so
*NL*
sweet
and
sensitive
that
she
feels
influences
more
acutely
than
other
*NL*
people
do
.
Just
now
she
was
quite
upset
by
a
little
thing
which
I
did
*NL*
not
much
heed
,
though
I
am
myself
very
fond
of
animals
.
One
of
the
men
*NL*
who
came
up
here
often
to
look
for
the
boats
was
followed
by
his
dog
.
*NL*
The
dog
is
always
with
him
.
They
are
both
quiet
persons
,
and
I
never
saw
*NL*
the
man
angry
,
nor
heard
the
dog
bark
.
During
the
service
the
dog
would
*NL*
not
come
to
its
master
,
who
was
on
the
seat
with
us
,
but
kept
a
few
*NL*
yards
off
,
barking
and
howling
.
Its
master
spoke
to
it
gently
,
and
then
*NL*
harshly
,
and
then
angrily
;
but
it
would
neither
come
nor
cease
to
make
a
*NL*
noise
.
It
was
in
a
sort
of
fury
,
with
its
eyes
savage
,
and
all
its
hairs
*NL*
bristling
out
like
a
cat
's
tail
when
puss
is
on
the
war-path
.
Finally
*NL*
the
man
,
too
,
got
angry
,
and
jumped
down
and
kicked
the
dog
,
and
then
*NL*
took
it
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
half
dragged
and
half
threw
it
on
*NL*
the
tombstone
on
which
the
seat
is
fixed
.
The
moment
it
touched
the
*NL*
stone
the
poor
thing
became
quiet
and
fell
all
into
a
tremble
.
It
did
*NL*
not
try
to
get
away
,
but
crouched
down
,
quivering
and
cowering
,
and
was
*NL*
in
such
a
pitiable
state
of
terror
that
I
tried
,
though
without
effect
,
*NL*
to
comfort
it
.
Lucy
was
full
of
pity
,
too
,
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
*NL*
touch
the
dog
,
but
looked
at
it
in
an
agonised
sort
of
way
.
I
greatly
*NL*
fear
that
she
is
of
too
super-sensitive
a
nature
to
go
through
the
world
*NL*
without
trouble
.
She
will
be
dreaming
of
this
to-night
,
I
am
sure
.
The
*NL*
whole
agglomeration
of
things
--
the
ship
steered
into
port
by
a
dead
*NL*
man
;
his
attitude
,
tied
to
the
wheel
with
a
crucifix
and
beads
;
the
*NL*
touching
funeral
;
the
dog
,
now
furious
and
now
in
terror
--
will
all
*NL*
afford
material
for
her
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
it
will
be
best
for
her
to
go
to
bed
tired
out
physically
,
so
I
*NL*
shall
take
her
for
a
long
walk
by
the
cliffs
to
Robin
Hood
's
Bay
and
*NL*
back
.
She
ought
not
to
have
much
inclination
for
sleep-walking
then
.

*NL*
_
Same
day
,
11
o'clock
p.
m.
_
--
Oh
,
but
I
am
tired
!
If
it
were
not
that
I
*NL*
had
made
my
diary
a
duty
I
should
not
open
it
to-night
.
We
had
a
lovely
*NL*
walk
.
Lucy
,
after
a
while
,
was
in
gay
spirits
,
owing
,
I
think
,
to
some
*NL*
dear
cows
who
came
nosing
towards
us
in
a
field
close
to
the
lighthouse
,
*NL*
and
frightened
the
wits
out
of
us
.
I
believe
we
forgot
everything
*NL*
except
,
of
course
,
personal
fear
,
and
it
seemed
to
wipe
the
slate
clean
*NL*
and
give
us
a
fresh
start
.
We
had
a
capital
``
severe
tea
''
at
Robin
Hood
's
*NL*
Bay
in
a
sweet
little
old-fashioned
inn
,
with
a
bow-window
right
over
*NL*
the
seaweed-covered
rocks
of
the
strand
.
I
believe
we
should
have
*NL*
shocked
the
``
New
Woman
''
with
our
appetites
.
Men
are
more
tolerant
,
bless
*NL*
them
!
Then
we
walked
home
with
some
,
or
rather
many
,
stoppages
to
rest
,
*NL*
and
with
our
hearts
full
of
a
constant
dread
of
wild
bulls
.
Lucy
was
*NL*
really
tired
,
and
we
intended
to
creep
off
to
bed
as
soon
as
we
could
.
*NL*
The
young
curate
came
in
,
however
,
and
Mrs.
Westenra
asked
him
to
stay
*NL*
for
supper
.
Lucy
and
I
had
both
a
fight
for
it
with
the
dusty
miller
;
I
*NL*
know
it
was
a
hard
fight
on
my
part
,
and
I
am
quite
heroic
.
I
think
that
*NL*
some
day
the
bishops
must
get
together
and
see
about
breeding
up
a
new
*NL*
class
of
curates
,
who
do
n't
take
supper
,
no
matter
how
they
may
be
*NL*
pressed
to
,
and
who
will
know
when
girls
are
tired
.
Lucy
is
asleep
and
*NL*
breathing
softly
.
She
has
more
colour
in
her
cheeks
than
usual
,
and
*NL*
looks
,
oh
,
so
sweet
.
If
Mr.
Holmwood
fell
in
love
with
her
seeing
her
*NL*
only
in
the
drawing-room
,
I
wonder
what
he
would
say
if
he
saw
her
now
.
*NL*
Some
of
the
``
New
Women
''
writers
will
some
day
start
an
idea
that
men
and
*NL*
women
should
be
allowed
to
see
each
other
asleep
before
proposing
or
*NL*
accepting
.
But
I
suppose
the
New
Woman
wo
n't
condescend
in
future
to
*NL*
accept
;
she
will
do
the
proposing
herself
.
And
a
nice
job
she
will
make
*NL*
of
it
,
too
!
There
's
some
consolation
in
that
.
I
am
so
happy
to-night
,
*NL*
because
dear
Lucy
seems
better
.
I
really
believe
she
has
turned
the
*NL*
corner
,
and
that
we
are
over
her
troubles
with
dreaming
.
I
should
be
*NL*
quite
happy
if
I
only
knew
if
Jonathan
...
God
bless
and
keep
him
.

Diary
again
.
No
sleep
now
,
so
I
may
as
well
write
.
*NL*
I
am
too
agitated
to
sleep
.
We
have
had
such
an
adventure
,
such
an
*NL*
agonising
experience
.
I
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
I
had
closed
my
diary
...
*NL*
Suddenly
I
became
broad
awake
,
and
sat
up
,
with
a
horrible
sense
of
fear
*NL*
upon
me
,
and
of
some
feeling
of
emptiness
around
me
.
The
room
was
dark
,
*NL*
so
I
could
not
see
Lucy
's
bed
;
I
stole
across
and
felt
for
her
.
The
bed
*NL*
was
empty
.
I
lit
a
match
and
found
that
she
was
not
in
the
room
.
The
*NL*
door
was
shut
,
but
not
locked
,
as
I
had
left
it
.
I
feared
to
wake
her
*NL*
mother
,
who
has
been
more
than
usually
ill
lately
,
so
threw
on
some
*NL*
clothes
and
got
ready
to
look
for
her
.
As
I
was
leaving
the
room
it
*NL*
struck
me
that
the
clothes
she
wore
might
give
me
some
clue
to
her
*NL*
dreaming
intention
.
Dressing-gown
would
mean
house
;
dress
,
outside
.
*NL*
Dressing-gown
and
dress
were
both
in
their
places
.
``
Thank
God
,
''
I
said
*NL*
to
myself
,
``
she
can
not
be
far
,
as
she
is
only
in
her
nightdress
.
''
I
ran
*NL*
downstairs
and
looked
in
the
sitting-room
.
Not
there
!
Then
I
looked
in
*NL*
all
the
other
open
rooms
of
the
house
,
with
an
ever-growing
fear
*NL*
chilling
my
heart
.
Finally
I
came
to
the
hall
door
and
found
it
open
.
It
*NL*
was
not
wide
open
,
but
the
catch
of
the
lock
had
not
caught
.
The
people
*NL*
of
the
house
are
careful
to
lock
the
door
every
night
,
so
I
feared
that
*NL*
Lucy
must
have
gone
out
as
she
was
.
There
was
no
time
to
think
of
what
*NL*
might
happen
;
a
vague
,
overmastering
fear
obscured
all
details
.
I
took
a
*NL*
big
,
heavy
shawl
and
ran
out
.
The
clock
was
striking
one
as
I
was
in
the
*NL*
Crescent
,
and
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
.
I
ran
along
the
North
*NL*
Terrace
,
but
could
see
no
sign
of
the
white
figure
which
I
expected
.
At
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
West
Cliff
above
the
pier
I
looked
across
the
harbour
to
*NL*
the
East
Cliff
,
in
the
hope
or
fear
--
I
do
n't
know
which
--
of
seeing
Lucy
*NL*
in
our
favourite
seat
.
There
was
a
bright
full
moon
,
with
heavy
black
,
*NL*
driving
clouds
,
which
threw
the
whole
scene
into
a
fleeting
diorama
of
*NL*
light
and
shade
as
they
sailed
across
.
For
a
moment
or
two
I
could
see
*NL*
nothing
,
as
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
obscured
St.
Mary
's
Church
and
all
*NL*
around
it
.
Then
as
the
cloud
passed
I
could
see
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
*NL*
coming
into
view
;
and
as
the
edge
of
a
narrow
band
of
light
as
sharp
as
*NL*
a
sword-cut
moved
along
,
the
church
and
the
churchyard
became
gradually
*NL*
visible
.
Whatever
my
expectation
was
,
it
was
not
disappointed
,
for
*NL*
there
,
on
our
favourite
seat
,
the
silver
light
of
the
moon
struck
a
*NL*
half-reclining
figure
,
snowy
white
.
The
coming
of
the
cloud
was
too
*NL*
quick
for
me
to
see
much
,
for
shadow
shut
down
on
light
almost
*NL*
immediately
;
but
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
something
dark
stood
behind
*NL*
the
seat
where
the
white
figure
shone
,
and
bent
over
it
.
What
it
was
,
*NL*
whether
man
or
beast
,
I
could
not
tell
;
I
did
not
wait
to
catch
another
*NL*
glance
,
but
flew
down
the
steep
steps
to
the
pier
and
along
by
the
*NL*
fish-market
to
the
bridge
,
which
was
the
only
way
to
reach
the
East
*NL*
Cliff
.
The
town
seemed
as
dead
,
for
not
a
soul
did
I
see
;
I
rejoiced
*NL*
that
it
was
so
,
for
I
wanted
no
witness
of
poor
Lucy
's
condition
.
The
*NL*
time
and
distance
seemed
endless
,
and
my
knees
trembled
and
my
breath
*NL*
came
laboured
as
I
toiled
up
the
endless
steps
to
the
abbey
.
I
must
have
*NL*
gone
fast
,
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
my
feet
were
weighted
with
*NL*
lead
,
and
as
though
every
joint
in
my
body
were
rusty
.
When
I
got
almost
*NL*
to
the
top
I
could
see
the
seat
and
the
white
figure
,
for
I
was
now
*NL*
close
enough
to
distinguish
it
even
through
the
spells
of
shadow
.
There
*NL*
was
undoubtedly
something
,
long
and
black
,
bending
over
the
*NL*
half-reclining
white
figure
.
I
called
in
fright
,
``
Lucy
!
Lucy
!
''
and
*NL*
something
raised
a
head
,
and
from
where
I
was
I
could
see
a
white
face
*NL*
and
red
,
gleaming
eyes
.
Lucy
did
not
answer
,
and
I
ran
on
to
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
churchyard
.
As
I
entered
,
the
church
was
between
me
and
*NL*
the
seat
,
and
for
a
minute
or
so
I
lost
sight
of
her
.
When
I
came
in
*NL*
view
again
the
cloud
had
passed
,
and
the
moonlight
struck
so
brilliantly
*NL*
that
I
could
see
Lucy
half
reclining
with
her
head
lying
over
the
back
*NL*
of
the
seat
.
She
was
quite
alone
,
and
there
was
not
a
sign
of
any
living
*NL*
thing
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
bent
over
her
I
could
see
that
she
was
still
asleep
.
Her
lips
*NL*
were
parted
,
and
she
was
breathing
--
not
softly
as
usual
with
her
,
but
in
*NL*
long
,
heavy
gasps
,
as
though
striving
to
get
her
lungs
full
at
every
*NL*
breath
.
As
I
came
close
,
she
put
up
her
hand
in
her
sleep
and
pulled
the
*NL*
collar
of
her
nightdress
close
around
her
throat
.
Whilst
she
did
so
*NL*
there
came
a
little
shudder
through
her
,
as
though
she
felt
the
cold
.
I
*NL*
flung
the
warm
shawl
over
her
,
and
drew
the
edges
tight
round
her
neck
,
*NL*
for
I
dreaded
lest
she
should
get
some
deadly
chill
from
the
night
air
,
*NL*
unclad
as
she
was
.
I
feared
to
wake
her
all
at
once
,
so
,
in
order
to
*NL*
have
my
hands
free
that
I
might
help
her
,
I
fastened
the
shawl
at
her
*NL*
throat
with
a
big
safety-pin
;
but
I
must
have
been
clumsy
in
my
anxiety
*NL*
and
pinched
or
pricked
her
with
it
,
for
by-and-by
,
when
her
breathing
*NL*
became
quieter
,
she
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
again
and
moaned
.
When
I
*NL*
had
her
carefully
wrapped
up
I
put
my
shoes
on
her
feet
and
then
began
*NL*
very
gently
to
wake
her
.
At
first
she
did
not
respond
;
but
gradually
she
*NL*
became
more
and
more
uneasy
in
her
sleep
,
moaning
and
sighing
*NL*
occasionally
.
At
last
,
as
time
was
passing
fast
,
and
,
for
many
other
*NL*
reasons
,
I
wished
to
get
her
home
at
once
,
I
shook
her
more
forcibly
,
*NL*
till
finally
she
opened
her
eyes
and
awoke
.
She
did
not
seem
surprised
*NL*
to
see
me
,
as
,
of
course
,
she
did
not
realise
all
at
once
where
she
was
.
*NL*
Lucy
always
wakes
prettily
,
and
even
at
such
a
time
,
when
her
body
must
*NL*
have
been
chilled
with
cold
,
and
her
mind
somewhat
appalled
at
waking
*NL*
unclad
in
a
churchyard
at
night
,
she
did
not
lose
her
grace
.
She
*NL*
trembled
a
little
,
and
clung
to
me
;
when
I
told
her
to
come
at
once
with
*NL*
me
home
she
rose
without
a
word
,
with
the
obedience
of
a
child
.
As
we
*NL*
passed
along
,
the
gravel
hurt
my
feet
,
and
Lucy
noticed
me
wince
.
She
*NL*
stopped
and
wanted
to
insist
upon
my
taking
my
shoes
;
but
I
would
not
.
*NL*
However
,
when
we
got
to
the
pathway
outside
the
churchyard
,
where
there
*NL*
was
a
puddle
of
water
,
remaining
from
the
storm
,
I
daubed
my
feet
with
*NL*
mud
,
using
each
foot
in
turn
on
the
other
,
so
that
as
we
went
home
,
no
*NL*
one
,
in
case
we
should
meet
any
one
,
should
notice
my
bare
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortune
favoured
us
,
and
we
got
home
without
meeting
a
soul
.
Once
we
saw
*NL*
a
man
,
who
seemed
not
quite
sober
,
passing
along
a
street
in
front
of
*NL*
us
;
but
we
hid
in
a
door
till
he
had
disappeared
up
an
opening
such
as
*NL*
there
are
here
,
steep
little
closes
,
or
``
wynds
,
''
as
they
call
them
in
*NL*
Scotland
.
My
heart
beat
so
loud
all
the
time
that
sometimes
I
thought
I
*NL*
should
faint
.
I
was
filled
with
anxiety
about
Lucy
,
not
only
for
her
*NL*
health
,
lest
she
should
suffer
from
the
exposure
,
but
for
her
reputation
*NL*
in
case
the
story
should
get
wind
.
When
we
got
in
,
and
had
washed
our
*NL*
feet
,
and
had
said
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
together
,
I
tucked
her
into
*NL*
bed
.
Before
falling
asleep
she
asked
--
even
implored
--
me
not
to
say
a
*NL*
word
to
any
one
,
even
her
mother
,
about
her
sleep-walking
adventure
.
I
*NL*
hesitated
at
first
to
promise
;
but
on
thinking
of
the
state
of
her
*NL*
mother
's
health
,
and
how
the
knowledge
of
such
a
thing
would
fret
her
,
*NL*
and
thinking
,
too
,
of
how
such
a
story
might
become
distorted
--
nay
,
*NL*
infallibly
would
--
in
case
it
should
leak
out
,
I
thought
it
wiser
to
do
*NL*
so
.
I
hope
I
did
right
.
I
have
locked
the
door
,
and
the
key
is
tied
to
*NL*
my
wrist
,
so
perhaps
I
shall
not
be
again
disturbed
.
Lucy
is
sleeping
*NL*
soundly
;
the
reflex
of
the
dawn
is
high
and
far
over
the
sea
...

_
Same
day

--
All
goes
well
.
Lucy
slept
till
I
woke
her
and
seemed
*NL*
not
to
have
even
changed
her
side
.
The
adventure
of
the
night
does
not
*NL*
seem
to
have
harmed
her
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
has
benefited
her
,
for
she
*NL*
looks
better
this
morning
than
she
has
done
for
weeks
.
I
was
sorry
to
*NL*
notice
that
my
clumsiness
with
the
safety-pin
hurt
her
.
Indeed
,
it
might
*NL*
have
been
serious
,
for
the
skin
of
her
throat
was
pierced
.
I
must
have
*NL*
pinched
up
a
piece
of
loose
skin
and
have
transfixed
it
,
for
there
are
*NL*
two
little
red
points
like
pin-pricks
,
and
on
the
band
of
her
nightdress
*NL*
was
a
drop
of
blood
.
When
I
apologised
and
was
concerned
about
it
,
she
*NL*
laughed
and
petted
me
,
and
said
she
did
not
even
feel
it
.
Fortunately
it
*NL*
can
not
leave
a
scar
,
as
it
is
so
tiny
.

_
Same

--
We
passed
a
happy
day
.
The
air
was
clear
,
and
the
*NL*
sun
bright
,
and
there
was
a
cool
breeze
.
We
took
our
lunch
to
Mulgrave
*NL*
Woods
,
Mrs.
Westenra
driving
by
the
road
and
Lucy
and
I
walking
by
the
*NL*
cliff-path
and
joining
her
at
the
gate
.
I
felt
a
little
sad
myself
,
for
*NL*
I
could
not
but
feel
how
_
absolutely
_
happy
it
would
have
been
had
*NL*
Jonathan
been
with
me
.
But
there
!
I
must
only
be
patient
.
In
the
evening
*NL*
we
strolled
in
the
Casino
Terrace
,
and
heard
some
good
music
by
Spohr
*NL*
and
Mackenzie
,
and
went
to
bed
early
.
Lucy
seems
more
restful
than
she
*NL*
has
been
for
some
time
,
and
fell
asleep
at
once
.
I
shall
lock
the
door
*NL*
and
secure
the
key
the
same
as
before
,
though
I
do
not
expect
any
*NL*
trouble
to-night
.

12
August

_
--
My
expectations
were
wrong
,
for
twice
during
the
night
I
*NL*
was
wakened
by
Lucy
trying
to
get
out
.
She
seemed
,
even
in
her
sleep
,
to
*NL*
be
a
little
impatient
at
finding
the
door
shut
,
and
went
back
to
bed
*NL*
under
a
sort
of
protest
.
I
woke
with
the
dawn
,
and
heard
the
birds
*NL*
chirping
outside
of
the
window
.
Lucy
woke
,
too
,
and
,
I
was
glad
to
see
,
*NL*
was
even
better
than
on
the
previous
morning
.
All
her
old
gaiety
of
*NL*
manner
seemed
to
have
come
back
,
and
she
came
and
snuggled
in
beside
me
*NL*
and
told
me
all
about
Arthur
.
I
told
her
how
anxious
I
was
about
*NL*
Jonathan
,
and
then
she
tried
to
comfort
me
.
Well
,
she
succeeded
*NL*
somewhat
,
for
,
though
sympathy
ca
n't
alter
facts
,
it
can
help
to

Another
quiet
day
,
and
to
bed
with
the
key
on
my
wrist
as
*NL*
before
.
Again
I
awoke
in
the
night
,
and
found
Lucy
sitting
up
in
bed
,
*NL*
still
asleep
,
pointing
to
the
window
.
I
got
up
quietly
,
and
pulling
*NL*
aside
the
blind
,
looked
out
.
It
was
brilliant
moonlight
,
and
the
soft
*NL*
effect
of
the
light
over
the
sea
and
sky
--
merged
together
in
one
great
,
*NL*
silent
mystery
--
was
beautiful
beyond
words
.
Between
me
and
the
moonlight
*NL*
flitted
a
great
bat
,
coming
and
going
in
great
whirling
circles
.
Once
or
*NL*
twice
it
came
quite
close
,
but
was
,
I
suppose
,
frightened
at
seeing
me
,
*NL*
and
flitted
away
across
the
harbour
towards
the
abbey
.
When
I
came
back
*NL*
from
the
window
Lucy
had
lain
down
again
,
and
was
sleeping
peacefully
.
*NL*
She
did
not
stir
again
all
night
.

--
On
the
East
Cliff
,
reading
and
writing
all
day
.
Lucy
seems
*NL*
to
have
become
as
much
in
love
with
the
spot
as
I
am
,
and
it
is
hard
to
*NL*
get
her
away
from
it
when
it
is
time
to
come
home
for
lunch
or
tea
or
*NL*
dinner
.
This
afternoon
she
made
a
funny
remark
.
We
were
coming
home
for
*NL*
dinner
,
and
had
come
to
the
top
of
the
steps
up
from
the
West
Pier
and
*NL*
stopped
to
look
at
the
view
,
as
we
generally
do
.
The
setting
sun
,
low
*NL*
down
in
the
sky
,
was
just
dropping
behind
Kettleness
;
the
red
light
was
*NL*
thrown
over
on
the
East
Cliff
and
the
old
abbey
,
and
seemed
to
bathe
*NL*
everything
in
a
beautiful
rosy
glow
.
We
were
silent
for
a
while
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
Lucy
murmured
as
if
to
herself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
red
eyes
again
!
They
are
just
the
same
.
''
It
was
such
an
odd
*NL*
expression
,
coming
_
apropos
_
of
nothing
,
that
it
quite
startled
me
.
I
*NL*
slewed
round
a
little
,
so
as
to
see
Lucy
well
without
seeming
to
stare
*NL*
at
her
,
and
saw
that
she
was
in
a
half-dreamy
state
,
with
an
odd
look
on
*NL*
her
face
that
I
could
not
quite
make
out
;
so
I
said
nothing
,
but
*NL*
followed
her
eyes
.
She
appeared
to
be
looking
over
at
our
own
seat
,
*NL*
whereon
was
a
dark
figure
seated
alone
.
I
was
a
little
startled
myself
,
*NL*
for
it
seemed
for
an
instant
as
if
the
stranger
had
great
eyes
like
*NL*
burning
flames
;
but
a
second
look
dispelled
the
illusion
.
The
red
*NL*
sunlight
was
shining
on
the
windows
of
St.
Mary
's
Church
behind
our
*NL*
seat
,
and
as
the
sun
dipped
there
was
just
sufficient
change
in
the
*NL*
refraction
and
reflection
to
make
it
appear
as
if
the
light
moved
.
I
*NL*
called
Lucy
's
attention
to
the
peculiar
effect
,
and
she
became
herself
*NL*
with
a
start
,
but
she
looked
sad
all
the
same
;
it
may
have
been
that
she
*NL*
was
thinking
of
that
terrible
night
up
there
.
We
never
refer
to
it
;
so
I
*NL*
said
nothing
,
and
we
went
home
to
dinner
.
Lucy
had
a
headache
and
went
*NL*
early
to
bed
.
I
saw
her
asleep
,
and
went
out
for
a
little
stroll
myself
;
*NL*
I
walked
along
the
cliffs
to
the
westward
,
and
was
full
of
sweet
*NL*
sadness
,
for
I
was
thinking
of
Jonathan
.
When
coming
home
--
it
was
then
*NL*
bright
moonlight
,
so
bright
that
,
though
the
front
of
our
part
of
the
*NL*
Crescent
was
in
shadow
,
everything
could
be
well
seen
--
I
threw
a
glance
*NL*
up
at
our
window
,
and
saw
Lucy
's
head
leaning
out
.
I
thought
that
*NL*
perhaps
she
was
looking
out
for
me
,
so
I
opened
my
handkerchief
and
*NL*
waved
it
.
She
did
not
notice
or
make
any
movement
whatever
.
Just
then
,
*NL*
the
moonlight
crept
round
an
angle
of
the
building
,
and
the
light
fell
*NL*
on
the
window
.
There
distinctly
was
Lucy
with
her
head
lying
up
against
*NL*
the
side
of
the
window-sill
and
her
eyes
shut
.
She
was
fast
asleep
,
and
*NL*
by
her
,
seated
on
the
window-sill
,
was
something
that
looked
like
a
*NL*
good-sized
bird
.
I
was
afraid
she
might
get
a
chill
,
so
I
ran
upstairs
,
*NL*
but
as
I
came
into
the
room
she
was
moving
back
to
her
bed
,
fast
*NL*
asleep
,
and
breathing
heavily
;
she
was
holding
her
hand
to
her
throat
,
*NL*
as
though
to
protect
it
from
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
wake
her
,
but
tucked
her
up
warmly
;
I
have
taken
care
that
the
*NL*
door
is
locked
and
the
window
securely
fastened
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looks
so
sweet
as
she
sleeps
;
but
she
is
paler
than
is
her
wont
,
and
*NL*
there
is
a
drawn
,
haggard
look
under
her
eyes
which
I
do
not
like
.
I
*NL*
fear
she
is
fretting
about
something
.
I
wish
I
could
find
out
what
it
*NL*
is
.

--
Rose
later
than
usual
.
Lucy
was
languid
and
tired
,
and
*NL*
slept
on
after
we
had
been
called
.
We
had
a
happy
surprise
at
breakfast
.
*NL*
Arthur
's
father
is
better
,
and
wants
the
marriage
to
come
off
soon
.
Lucy
*NL*
is
full
of
quiet
joy
,
and
her
mother
is
glad
and
sorry
at
once
.
Later
on
*NL*
in
the
day
she
told
me
the
cause
.
She
is
grieved
to
lose
Lucy
as
her
*NL*
very
own
,
but
she
is
rejoiced
that
she
is
soon
to
have
some
one
to
*NL*
protect
her
.
Poor
dear
,
sweet
lady
!
She
confided
to
me
that
she
has
got
*NL*
her
death-warrant
.
She
has
not
told
Lucy
,
and
made
me
promise
secrecy
;
*NL*
her
doctor
told
her
that
within
a
few
months
,
at
most
,
she
must
die
,
for
*NL*
her
heart
is
weakening
.
At
any
time
,
even
now
,
a
sudden
shock
would
be
*NL*
almost
sure
to
kill
her
.
Ah
,
we
were
wise
to
keep
from
her
the
affair
of
*NL*
the
dreadful
night
of
Lucy
's
sleep-walking
.

No
diary
for
two
whole
days
.
I
have
not
had
the
heart
to
*NL*
write
.
Some
sort
of
shadowy
pall
seems
to
be
coming
over
our
happiness
.
*NL*
No
news
from
Jonathan
,
and
Lucy
seems
to
be
growing
weaker
,
whilst
her
*NL*
mother
's
hours
are
numbering
to
a
close
.
I
do
not
understand
Lucy
's
*NL*
fading
away
as
she
is
doing
.
She
eats
well
and
sleeps
well
,
and
enjoys
*NL*
the
fresh
air
;
but
all
the
time
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
are
fading
,
and
*NL*
she
gets
weaker
and
more
languid
day
by
day
;
at
night
I
hear
her
gasping
*NL*
as
if
for
air
.
I
keep
the
key
of
our
door
always
fastened
to
my
wrist
at
*NL*
night
,
but
she
gets
up
and
walks
about
the
room
,
and
sits
at
the
open
*NL*
window
.
Last
night
I
found
her
leaning
out
when
I
woke
up
,
and
when
I
*NL*
tried
to
wake
her
I
could
not
;
she
was
in
a
faint
.
When
I
managed
to
*NL*
restore
her
she
was
as
weak
as
water
,
and
cried
silently
between
long
,
*NL*
painful
struggles
for
breath
.
When
I
asked
her
how
she
came
to
be
at
the
*NL*
window
she
shook
her
head
and
turned
away
.
I
trust
her
feeling
ill
may
*NL*
not
be
from
that
unlucky
prick
of
the
safety-pin
.
I
looked
at
her
throat
*NL*
just
now
as
she
lay
asleep
,
and
the
tiny
wounds
seem
not
to
have
healed
.
*NL*
They
are
still
open
,
and
,
if
anything
,
larger
than
before
,
and
the
*NL*
edges
of
them
are
faintly
white
.
They
are
like
little
white
dots
with
*NL*
red
centres
.
Unless
they
heal
within
a
day
or
two
,
I
shall
insist
on
the
*NL*
doctor
seeing
about
them
.

--
I
am
happy
to-day
,
and
write
sitting
on
the
seat
in
the
*NL*
churchyard
.
Lucy
is
ever
so
much
better
.
Last
night
she
slept
well
all
*NL*
night
,
and
did
not
disturb
me
once
.
The
roses
seem
coming
back
already
*NL*
to
her
cheeks
,
though
she
is
still
sadly
pale
and
wan-looking
.
If
she
*NL*
were
in
any
way
anaemic
I
could
understand
it
,
but
she
is
not
.
She
is
in
*NL*
gay
spirits
and
full
of
life
and
cheerfulness
.
All
the
morbid
reticence
*NL*
seems
to
have
passed
from
her
,
and
she
has
just
reminded
me
,
as
if
I
*NL*
needed
any
reminding
,
of
_
that
_
night
,
and
that
it
was
here
,
on
this
*NL*
very
seat
,
I
found
her
asleep
.
As
she
told
me
she
tapped
playfully
with
*NL*
the
heel
of
her
boot
on
the
stone
slab
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
little
feet
did
n't
make
much
noise
then
!
I
daresay
poor
old
Mr.
*NL*
Swales
would
have
told
me
that
it
was
because
I
did
n't
want
to
wake
up
*NL*
Geordie
.
''
As
she
was
in
such
a
communicative
humour
,
I
asked
her
if
she
*NL*
had
dreamed
at
all
that
night
.
Before
she
answered
,
that
sweet
,
puckered
*NL*
look
came
into
her
forehead
,
which
Arthur
--
I
call
him
Arthur
from
her
*NL*
habit
--
says
he
loves
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
do
n't
wonder
that
he
does
.
Then
she
*NL*
went
on
in
a
half-dreaming
kind
of
way
,
as
if
trying
to
recall
it
to
*NL*
herself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
quite
dream
;
but
it
all
seemed
to
be
real
.
I
only
wanted
to
be
*NL*
here
in
this
spot
--
I
do
n't
know
why
,
for
I
was
afraid
of
something
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
.
I
remember
,
though
I
suppose
I
was
asleep
,
passing
*NL*
through
the
streets
and
over
the
bridge
.
A
fish
leaped
as
I
went
by
,
and
*NL*
I
leaned
over
to
look
at
it
,
and
I
heard
a
lot
of
dogs
howling
--
the
*NL*
whole
town
seemed
as
if
it
must
be
full
of
dogs
all
howling
at
once
--
as
*NL*
I
went
up
the
steps
.
Then
I
had
a
vague
memory
of
something
long
and
*NL*
dark
with
red
eyes
,
just
as
we
saw
in
the
sunset
,
and
something
very
*NL*
sweet
and
very
bitter
all
around
me
at
once
;
and
then
I
seemed
sinking
*NL*
into
deep
green
water
,
and
there
was
a
singing
in
my
ears
,
as
I
have
*NL*
heard
there
is
to
drowning
men
;
and
then
everything
seemed
passing
away
*NL*
from
me
;
my
soul
seemed
to
go
out
from
my
body
and
float
about

*NL*
I
seem
to
remember
that
once
the
West
Lighthouse
was
right
under
me
,
*NL*
and
then
there
was
a
sort
of
agonising
feeling
,
as
if
I
were
in
an
*NL*
earthquake
,
and
I
came
back
and
found
you
shaking
my
body
.
I
saw
you
do
*NL*
it
before
I
felt
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
began
to
laugh
.
It
seemed
a
little
uncanny
to
me
,
and
I
*NL*
listened
to
her
breathlessly
.
I
did
not
quite
like
it
,
and
thought
it
*NL*
better
not
to
keep
her
mind
on
the
subject
,
so
we
drifted
on
to
other
*NL*
subjects
,
and
Lucy
was
like
her
old
self
again
.
When
we
got
home
the
*NL*
fresh
breeze
had
braced
her
up
,
and
her
pale
cheeks
were
really
more
*NL*
rosy
.
Her
mother
rejoiced
when
she
saw
her
,
and
we
all
spent
a
very
*NL*
happy
evening
together
.

At

,
news
of
*NL*
Jonathan
.
The
dear
fellow
has
been
ill
;
that
is
why
he
did
not
write
.
I
*NL*
am
not
afraid
to
think
it
or
say
it
,
now
that
I
know
.
Mr.
Hawkins
sent
*NL*
me
on
the
letter
,
and
wrote
himself
,
oh
,
so
kindly
.
I
am
to
leave
in
the
*NL*
morning
and
go
over
to
Jonathan
,
and
to
help
to
nurse
him
if
necessary
,
*NL*
and
to
bring
him
home
.
Mr.
Hawkins
says
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
if
*NL*
we
were
to
be
married
out
there
.
I
have
cried
over
the
good
Sister
's
*NL*
letter
till
I
can
feel
it
wet
against
my
bosom
,
where
it
lies
.
It
is
of
*NL*
Jonathan
,
and
must
be
next
my
heart
,
for
he
is
_
in
_
my
heart
.
My
journey
*NL*
is
all
mapped
out
,
and
my
luggage
ready
.
I
am
only
taking
one
change
of
*NL*
dress
;
Lucy
will
bring
my
trunk
to
London
and
keep
it
till
I
send
for
*NL*
it
,
for
it
may
be
that
...
I
must
write
no
more
;
I
must
keep
it
to
say
*NL*
to
Jonathan
,
my
husband
.
The
letter
that
he
has
seen
and
touched
must
*NL*
comfort
me
till
we
meet
.

He

My

I
open
this
to
let
you
know
something
*NL*
more

He
has
told
me
all
about
you
,
and
that
you
are
shortly
to
be
his
*NL*
wife

All
blessings
to
you
both

He
has
had
some
fearful
shock
--
so
says
*NL*
our
doctor
--
and
in
his
delirium
his
ravings
have
been
dreadful
;
of
*NL*
wolves
and
poison
and
blood
;
of
ghosts
and
demons
;
and
I
fear
to
say
of
*NL*
what
.
Be
careful
with
him
always
that
there
may
be
nothing
to
excite
him
*NL*
of
this
kind
for
a
long
time
to
come
;
the
traces
of
such
an
illness
as
*NL*
his
do
not
lightly
die
away
.
We
should
have
written
long
ago
,
but
we
*NL*
knew
nothing
of
his
friends
,
and
there
was
on
him
nothing
that
any
one
*NL*
could
understand
.
He
came
in
the
train
from
Klausenburg
,
and
the
guard
*NL*
was
told
by
the
station-master
there
that
he
rushed
into
the
station
*NL*
shouting
for
a
ticket
for
home
.
Seeing
from
his
violent
demeanour
that
*NL*
he
was
English
,
they
gave
him
a
ticket
for
the
furthest
station
on
the
*NL*
way
thither
that
the
train
reached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
assured

he

He
has
won
all

sweetness
and
gentleness

He
is
truly
getting
on
well

I
have
no

doubt
will
in
a
few
weeks
be
all
himself
.
But
be
careful
of
him
for

safety
's

There
are

pray
God

--
Strange
and
sudden
change
in
Renfield
last
night
.
About
*NL*
eight
o'clock
he
began
to
get
excited
and
sniff
about
as
a
dog
does
when
*NL*
setting
.
The
attendant
was
struck
by
his
manner
,
and
knowing
my
interest
*NL*
in
him
,
encouraged
him
to
talk
.
He
is
usually
respectful
to
the
*NL*
attendant
and
at
times
servile
;
but
to-night
,
the
man
tells
me
,
he
was
*NL*
quite
haughty
.
Would
not
condescend
to
talk
with
him
at
all
.
All
he
*NL*
would
say
was
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
talk
to
you
:
you
do
n't
count
now
;
the
Master
is
at
*NL*
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
attendant
thinks
it
is
some
sudden
form
of
religious
mania
which
has
*NL*
seized
him
.
If
so
,
we
must
look
out
for
squalls
,
for
a
strong
man
with
*NL*
homicidal
and
religious
mania
at
once
might
be
dangerous
.
The
*NL*
combination
is
a
dreadful
one
.
At
nine
o'clock
I
visited
him
myself
.
His
*NL*
attitude
to
me
was
the
same
as
that
to
the
attendant
;
in
his
sublime
*NL*
self-feeling
the
difference
between
myself
and
attendant
seemed
to
him
*NL*
as
nothing
.
It
looks
like
religious
mania
,
and
he
will
soon
think
that
*NL*
he
himself
is
God
.
These
infinitesimal
distinctions
between
man
and
man
*NL*
are
too
paltry
for
an
Omnipotent
Being
.
How
these
madmen
give
themselves
*NL*
away
!
The
real
God
taketh
heed
lest
a
sparrow
fall
;
but
the
God
created
*NL*
from
human
vanity
sees
no
difference
between
an
eagle
and
a
sparrow
.
Oh
,
*NL*
if
men
only
knew
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
half
an
hour
or
more
Renfield
kept
getting
excited
in
greater
and
*NL*
greater
degree
.
I
did
not
pretend
to
be
watching
him
,
but
I
kept
strict
*NL*
observation
all
the
same
.
All
at
once
that
shifty
look
came
into
his
*NL*
eyes
which
we
always
see
when
a
madman
has
seized
an
idea
,
and
with
it
*NL*
the
shifty
movement
of
the
head
and
back
which
asylum
attendants
come
to
*NL*
know
so
well
.
He
became
quite
quiet
,
and
went
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
*NL*
bed
resignedly
,
and
looked
into
space
with
lack-lustre
eyes
.
I
thought
I
*NL*
would
find
out
if
his
apathy
were
real
or
only
assumed
,
and
tried
to
*NL*
lead
him
to
talk
of
his
pets
,
a
theme
which
had
never
failed
to
excite
*NL*
his
attention
.
At
first
he
made
no
reply
,
but
at
length
said
testily
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bother
them
all
!
I
do
n't
care
a
pin
about
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
I
said
.
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
tell
me
you
do
n't
care
about
*NL*
spiders
?
''
-LRB-
Spiders
at
present
are
his
hobby
and
the
note-book
is
filling
*NL*
up
with
columns
of
small
figures
.
-RRB-
To
this
he
answered
enigmatically
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bride-maidens
rejoice
the
eyes
that
wait
the
coming
of
the
bride
;
*NL*
but
when
the
bride
draweth
nigh
,
then
the
maidens
shine
not
to
the
eyes
*NL*
that
are
filled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
not
explain
himself
,
but
remained
obstinately
seated
on
his
bed
*NL*
all
the
time
I
remained
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
weary
to-night
and
low
in
spirits
.
I
can
not
but
think
of
Lucy
,
and
*NL*
how
different
things
might
have
been
.

I
shall
not
dishonour

Later

Glad
I
made
the
resolution
;
gladder
that
I
kept
to
it
.
I
had
*NL*
lain
tossing
about
,
and
had
heard
the
clock
strike
only
twice
,
when
the
*NL*
night-watchman
came
to
me
,
sent
up
from
the
ward
,
to
say
that
Renfield
*NL*
had
escaped
.
I
threw
on
my
clothes
and
ran
down
at
once
;
my
patient
is
*NL*
too
dangerous
a
person
to
be
roaming
about
.
Those
ideas
of
his
might
*NL*
work
out
dangerously
with
strangers
.
The
attendant
was
waiting
for
me
.
*NL*
He
said
he
had
seen
him
not
ten
minutes
before
,
seemingly
asleep
in
his
*NL*
bed
,
when
he
had
looked
through
the
observation-trap
in
the
door
.
His
*NL*
attention
was
called
by
the
sound
of
the
window
being
wrenched
out
.
He
*NL*
ran
back
and
saw
his
feet
disappear
through
the
window
,
and
had
at
once
*NL*
sent
up
for
me
.
He
was
only
in
his
night-gear
,
and
can
not
be
far
off
.
*NL*
The
attendant
thought
it
would
be
more
useful
to
watch
where
he
should
*NL*
go
than
to
follow
him
,
as
he
might
lose
sight
of
him
whilst
getting
out
*NL*
of
the
building
by
the
door
.
He
is
a
bulky
man
,
and
could
n't
get
through
*NL*
the
window
.
I
am
thin
,
so
,
with
his
aid
,
I
got
out
,
but
feet
foremost
,
*NL*
and
,
as
we
were
only
a
few
feet
above
ground
,
landed
unhurt
.
The
*NL*
attendant
told
me
the
patient
had
gone
to
the
left
,
and
had
taken
a
*NL*
straight
line
,
so
I
ran
as
quickly
as
I
could
.
As
I
got
through
the
belt
*NL*
of
trees
I
saw
a
white
figure
scale
the
high
wall
which
separates
our
*NL*
grounds
from
those
of
the
deserted
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ran
back
at
once
,
told
the
watchman
to
get
three
or
four
men
*NL*
immediately
and
follow
me
into
the
grounds
of
Carfax
,
in
case
our
friend
*NL*
might
be
dangerous
.
I
got
a
ladder
myself
,
and
crossing
the
wall
,
*NL*
dropped
down
on
the
other
side
.
I
could
see
Renfield
's
figure
just
*NL*
disappearing
behind
the
angle
of
the
house
,
so
I
ran
after
him
.
On
the
*NL*
far
side
of
the
house
I
found
him
pressed
close
against
the
old
*NL*
ironbound
oak
door
of
the
chapel
.
He
was
talking
,
apparently
to
some
*NL*
one
,
but
I
was
afraid
to
go
near
enough
to
hear
what
he
was
saying
,
lest
*NL*
I
might
frighten
him
,
and
he
should
run
off
.
Chasing
an
errant
swarm
of
*NL*
bees
is
nothing
to
following
a
naked
lunatic
,
when
the
fit
of
escaping
*NL*
is
upon
him
!
After
a
few
minutes
,
however
,
I
could
see
that
he
did
not
*NL*
take
note
of
anything
around
him
,
and
so
ventured
to
draw
nearer
to
*NL*
him
--
the
more
so
as
my
men
had
now
crossed
the
wall
and
were
closing
him
*NL*
in
.
I
heard
him
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
to
do
Your
bidding
,
Master
.
I
am
Your
slave
,
and
You
will
*NL*
reward
me
,
for
I
shall
be
faithful
.
I
have
worshipped
You
long
and
afar
*NL*
off
.
Now
that
You
are
near
,
I
await
Your
commands
,
and
You
will
not
pass
*NL*
me
by
,
will
You
,
dear
Master
,
in
Your
distribution
of
good
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
_
is
_
a
selfish
old
beggar
anyhow
.
He
thinks
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
*NL*
even
when
he
believes
he
is
in
a
Real
Presence
.
His
manias
make
a
*NL*
startling
combination
.
When
we
closed
in
on
him
he
fought
like
a
tiger
.
*NL*
He
is
immensely
strong
,
for
he
was
more
like
a
wild
beast
than
a
man
.
I
*NL*
never
saw
a
lunatic
in
such
a
paroxysm
of
rage
before
;
and
I
hope
I
*NL*
shall
not
again
.
It
is
a
mercy
that
we
have
found
out
his
strength
and
*NL*
his
danger
in
good
time
.
With
strength
and
determination
like
his
,
he
*NL*
might
have
done
wild
work
before
he
was
caged
.
He
is
safe
now
at
any
*NL*
rate
.
Jack
Sheppard
himself
could
n't
get
free
from
the
strait-waistcoat
*NL*
that
keeps
him
restrained
,
and
he
's
chained
to
the
wall
in
the
padded
*NL*
room
.
His
cries
are
at
times
awful
,
but
the
silences
that
follow
are
*NL*
more
deadly
still
,
for
he
means
murder
in
every
turn
and
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
now
he
spoke
coherent
words
for
the
first
time
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
patient
,
Master
.
It
is
coming
--
coming
--
coming
!

So
I
took
the
hint

and
came
too

I
was
too
excited
to
sleep

but
this

diary
has
quieted
me

and
I
feel
I
shall
get
some
sleep
to-night

``
My
dearest
Lucy
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
will
be
anxious
to
hear
all
that
has
happened
since
we
*NL*
parted
at
the
railway
station
at
Whitby
.
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
got
to
Hull
*NL*
all
right
,
and
caught
the
boat
to
Hamburg
,
and
then
the
train
on
here
.
I
*NL*
feel
that
I
can
hardly
recall
anything
of
the
journey
,
except
that
I
*NL*
knew
I
was
coming
to
Jonathan
,
and
,
that
as
I
should
have
to
do
some
*NL*
nursing
,
I
had
better
get
all
the
sleep
I
could
...
I
found
my
dear
one
,
*NL*
oh
,
so
thin
and
pale
and
weak-looking
.
All
the
resolution
has
gone
out
*NL*
of
his
dear
eyes
,
and
that
quiet
dignity
which
I
told
you
was
in
his
*NL*
face
has
vanished
.
He
is
only
a
wreck
of
himself
,
and
he
does
not
*NL*
remember
anything
that
has
happened
to
him
for
a
long
time
past
.
At
*NL*
least
,
he
wants
me
to
believe
so
,
and
I
shall
never
ask
.
He
has
had
some
*NL*
terrible
shock
,
and
I
fear
it
might
tax
his
poor
brain
if
he
were
to
try
*NL*
to
recall
it
.
Sister
Agatha
,
who
is
a
good
creature
and
a
born
nurse
,
*NL*
tells
me
that
he
raved
of
dreadful
things
whilst
he
was
off
his
head
.
I
*NL*
wanted
her
to
tell
me
what
they
were
;
but
she
would
only
cross
herself
,
*NL*
and
say
she
would
never
tell
;
that
the
ravings
of
the
sick
were
the
*NL*
secrets
of
God
,
and
that
if
a
nurse
through
her
vocation
should
hear
*NL*
them
,
she
should
respect
her
trust
.
She
is
a
sweet
,
good
soul
,
and
the
*NL*
next
day
,
when
she
saw
I
was
troubled
,
she
opened
up
the
subject
again
,
*NL*
and
after
saying
that
she
could
never
mention
what
my
poor
dear
raved
*NL*
about
,
added
:
'
I
can
tell
you
this
much
,
my
dear
:
that
it
was
not
about
*NL*
anything
which
he
has
done
wrong
himself
;
and
you
,
as
his
wife
to
be
,
*NL*
have
no
cause
to
be
concerned
.
He
has
not
forgotten
you
or
what
he
owes
*NL*
to
you
.
His
fear
was
of
great
and
terrible
things
,
which
no
mortal
can
*NL*
treat
of
.
'
I
do
believe
the
dear
soul
thought
I
might
be
jealous
lest
my
*NL*
poor
dear
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
any
other
girl
.
The
idea
of
*NL*
_
my
_
being
jealous
about
Jonathan
!
And
yet
,
my
dear
,
let
me
whisper
,
I
*NL*
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
through
me
when
I
_
knew
_
that
no
other
woman
was
a
*NL*
cause
of
trouble
.
I
am
now
sitting
by
his
bedside
,
where
I
can
see
his
*NL*
face
while
he
sleeps
.
He
is
waking
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
he
woke
he
asked
me
for
his
coat
,
as
he
wanted
to
get
something
*NL*
from
the
pocket
;
I
asked
Sister
Agatha
,
and
she
brought
all
his
things
.
*NL*
I
saw
that
amongst
them
was
his
note-book
,
and
was
going
to
ask
him
to
*NL*
let
me
look
at
it
--
for
I
knew
then
that
I
might
find
some
clue
to
his
*NL*
trouble
--
but
I
suppose
he
must
have
seen
my
wish
in
my
eyes
,
for
he
sent
*NL*
me
over
to
the
window
,
saying
he
wanted
to
be
quite
alone
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
Then
he
called
me
back
,
and
when
I
came
he
had
his
hand
over
the
*NL*
note-book
,
and
he
said
to
me
very
solemnly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Wilhelmina
'
--
I
knew
then
that
he
was
in
deadly
earnest
,
for
he
has
*NL*
never
called
me
by
that
name
since
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
--
`
you
know
,
*NL*
dear
,
my
ideas
of
the
trust
between
husband
and
wife
:
there
should
be
no
*NL*
secret
,
no
concealment
.
I
have
had
a
great
shock
,
and
when
I
try
to
*NL*
think
of
what
it
is
I
feel
my
head
spin
round
,
and
I
do
not
know
if
it
*NL*
was
all
real
or
the
dreaming
of
a
madman
.
You
know
I
have
had
brain
*NL*
fever
,
and
that
is
to
be
mad
.
The
secret
is
here
,
and
I
do
not
want
to
*NL*
know
it
.
I
want
to
take
up
my
life
here
,
with
our
marriage
.
'
For
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
we
had
decided
to
be
married
as
soon
as
the
formalities
are
*NL*
complete
.
`
Are
you
willing
,
Wilhelmina
,
to
share
my
ignorance
?
Here
is
*NL*
the
book
.
Take
it
and
keep
it
,
read
it
if
you
will
,
but
never
let
me
*NL*
know
;
unless
,
indeed
,
some
solemn
duty
should
come
upon
me
to
go
back
to
*NL*
the
bitter
hours
,
asleep
or
awake
,
sane
or
mad
,
recorded
here
.
'
He
fell
*NL*
back
exhausted
,
and
I
put
the
book
under
his
pillow
,
and
kissed
him
.
I
*NL*
have
asked
Sister
Agatha
to
beg
the
Superior
to
let
our
wedding
be
this
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
am
waiting
her
reply
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
come
and
told
me
that
the
chaplain
of
the
English
mission
*NL*
church
has
been
sent
for
.
We
are
to
be
married
in
an
hour
,
or
as
soon
*NL*
after
as
Jonathan
awakes
...
*NL*
*NL*

*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
,
the
time
has
come
and
gone
.
I
feel
very
solemn
,
but
very
,
very
*NL*
happy
.
Jonathan
woke
a
little
after
the
hour
,
and
all
was
ready
,
and
he
*NL*
sat
up
in
bed
,
propped
up
with
pillows
.
He
answered
his
'
I
will
'
firmly
*NL*
and
strongly
.
I
could
hardly
speak
;
my
heart
was
so
full
that
even
those
*NL*
words
seemed
to
choke
me
.
The
dear
sisters
were
so
kind
.
Please
God
,
I
*NL*
shall
never
,
never
forget
them
,
nor
the
grave
and
sweet
responsibilities
*NL*
I
have
taken
upon
me
.
I
must
tell
you
of
my
wedding
present
.
When
the
*NL*
chaplain
and
the
sisters
had
left
me
alone
with
my
husband
--
oh
,
Lucy
,
it
*NL*
is
the
first
time
I
have
written
the
words
`
my
husband
'
--
left
me
alone
*NL*
with
my
husband
,
I
took
the
book
from
under
his
pillow
,
and
wrapped
it
*NL*
up
in
white
paper
,
and
tied
it
with
a
little
bit
of
pale
blue
ribbon
*NL*
which
was
round
my
neck
,
and
sealed
it
over
the
knot
with
sealing-wax
,
*NL*
and
for
my
seal
I
used
my
wedding
ring
.
Then
I
kissed
it
and
showed
it
*NL*
to
my
husband
,
and
told
him
that
I
would
keep
it
so
,
and
then
it
would
*NL*
be
an
outward
and
visible
sign
for
us
all
our
lives
that
we
trusted
each
*NL*
other
;
that
I
would
never
open
it
unless
it
were
for
his
own
dear
sake
*NL*
or
for
the
sake
of
some
stern
duty
.
Then
he
took
my
hand
in
his
,
and
oh
,
*NL*
Lucy
,
it
was
the
first
time
he
took
_
his
wife
's
_
hand
,
and
said
that
it
*NL*
was
the
dearest
thing
in
all
the
wide
world
,
and
that
he
would
go
*NL*
through
all
the
past
again
to
win
it
,
if
need
be
.
The
poor
dear
meant
to
*NL*
have
said
a
part
of
the
past
,
but
he
can
not
think
of
time
yet
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
not
wonder
if
at
first
he
mixes
up
not
only
the
month
,
but
the
*NL*
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
what
could
I
say
?
I
could
only
tell
him
that
I
was
the
*NL*
happiest
woman
in
all
the
wide
world
,
and
that
I
had
nothing
to
give
him
*NL*
except
myself
,
my
life
,
and
my
trust
,
and
that
with
these
went
my
love
*NL*
and
duty
for
all
the
days
of
my
life
.
And
,
my
dear
,
when
he
kissed
me
,
*NL*
and
drew
me
to
him
with
his
poor
weak
hands
,
it
was
like
a
very
solemn
*NL*
pledge
between
us
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucy
dear
,
do
you
know
why
I
tell
you
all
this
?
It
is
not
only
because
*NL*
it
is
all
sweet
to
me
,
but
because
you
have
been
,
and
are
,
very
dear
to
*NL*
me
.
It
was
my
privilege
to
be
your
friend
and
guide
when
you
came
from
*NL*
the
schoolroom
to
prepare
for
the
world
of
life
.
I
want
you
to
see
now
,
*NL*
and
with
the
eyes
of
a
very
happy
wife
,
whither
duty
has
led
me
;
so
that
*NL*
in
your
own
married
life
you
too
may
be
all
happy
as
I
am
.
My
dear
,
*NL*
please
Almighty
God
,
your
life
may
be
all
it
promises
:
a
long
day
of
*NL*
sunshine
,
with
no
harsh
wind
,
no
forgetting
duty
,
no
distrust
.
I
must
*NL*
not
wish
you
no
pain
,
for
that
can
never
be
;
but
I
do
hope
you
will
be
*NL*
_
always
_
as
happy
as
I
am
_
now
_

Good-bye
,
my
dear
.
I
shall
post
this
at
*NL*
once
,
and
,
perhaps
,
write
you
very
soon
again

must
stop

He

I

But

--
The
case
of
Renfield
grows
even
more
interesting
.
He
has
*NL*
now
so
far
quieted
that
there
are
spells
of
cessation
from
his
passion
.
*NL*
For
the
first
week
after
his
attack
he
was
perpetually
violent
.
Then
one
*NL*
night
,
just
as
the
moon
rose
,
he
grew
quiet
,
and
kept
murmuring
to
*NL*
himself
:
``
Now
I
can
wait
;
now
I
can
wait
.
''
The
attendant
came
to
tell
*NL*
me
,
so
I
ran
down
at
once
to
have
a
look
at
him
.
He
was
still
in
the
*NL*
strait-waistcoat
and
in
the
padded
room
,
but
the
suffused
look
had
gone
*NL*
from
his
face
,
and
his
eyes
had
something
of
their
old
pleading
--
I
might
*NL*
almost
say
,
``
cringing
''
--
softness
.
I
was
satisfied
with
his
present
*NL*
condition
,
and
directed
him
to
be
relieved
.
The
attendants
hesitated
,
*NL*
but
finally
carried
out
my
wishes
without
protest
.
It
was
a
strange
*NL*
thing
that
the
patient
had
humour
enough
to
see
their
distrust
,
for
,
*NL*
coming
close
to
me
,
he
said
in
a
whisper
,
all
the
while
looking
*NL*
furtively
at
them
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
think
I
could
hurt
you
!
Fancy
_
me
_
hurting
_
you
_
!
The
fools
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
soothing
,
somehow
,
to
the
feelings
to
find
myself
dissociated
*NL*
even
in
the
mind
of
this
poor
madman
from
the
others
;
but
all
the
same
I
*NL*
do
not
follow
his
thought
.
Am
I
to
take
it
that
I
have
anything
in
*NL*
common
with
him
,
so
that
we
are
,
as
it
were
,
to
stand
together
;
or
has
*NL*
he
to
gain
from
me
some
good
so
stupendous
that
my
well-being
is
needful
*NL*
to
him
?
I
must
find
out
later
on
.
To-night
he
will
not
speak
.
Even
the
*NL*
offer
of
a
kitten
or
even
a
full-grown
cat
will
not
tempt
him
.
He
will
*NL*
only
say
:
``
I
do
n't
take
any
stock
in
cats
.
I
have
more
to
think
of
now
,
*NL*
and
I
can
wait
;
I
can
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
I
left
him
.
The
attendant
tells
me
that
he
was
quiet
*NL*
until
just
before
dawn
,
and
that
then
he
began
to
get
uneasy
,
and
at
*NL*
length
violent
,
until
at
last
he
fell
into
a
paroxysm
which
exhausted
*NL*
him
so
that
he
swooned
into
a
sort
of
coma
.

Three
nights
has
the

thing
happened

violent
all
day
then
quiet
*NL*
from
moonrise
to
sunrise

I
wish
I
could
get
some
clue
to
the
cause
.
It
*NL*
would
almost
seem
as
if
there
was
some
influence
which
came
and
went
.
*NL*
Happy
thought
!
We
shall
to-night
play
sane
wits
against
mad
ones
.
He
*NL*
escaped
before
without
our
help
;
to-night
he
shall
escape
with
it
.
We
*NL*
shall
give
him
a
chance
,
and
have
the
men
ready
to
follow
in
case
they
*NL*
are
required

``
The

''
How
well
Disraeli
knew
*NL*
life
.
Our
bird
when
he
found
the
cage
open
would
not
fly
,
so
all
our
*NL*
subtle
arrangements
were
for
nought
.
At
any
rate
,
we
have
proved
one
*NL*
thing
;
that
the
spells
of
quietness
last
a
reasonable
time
.
We
shall
in
*NL*
future
be
able
to
ease
his
bonds
for
a
few
hours
each
day
.
I
have
given
*NL*
orders
to
the
night
attendant
merely
to
shut
him
in
the
padded
room
,
*NL*
when
once
he
is
quiet
,
until
an
hour
before
sunrise
.
The
poor
soul
's
*NL*
body
will
enjoy
the
relief
even
if
his
mind
can
not
appreciate
it
.
Hark
!

The
unexpected
again

I
am
called

the
patient
has
once
more
escaped

Later

--
Another
night
adventure
.
Renfield
artfully
waited
until
the
*NL*
attendant
was
entering
the
room
to
inspect
.
Then
he
dashed
out
past
him
*NL*
and
flew
down
the
passage
.
I
sent
word
for
the
attendants
to
follow
.
*NL*
Again
he
went
into
the
grounds
of
the
deserted
house
,
and
we
found
him
*NL*
in
the
same
place
,
pressed
against
the
old
chapel
door
.
When
he
saw
me
*NL*
he
became
furious
,
and
had
not
the
attendants
seized
him
in
time
,
he
*NL*
would
have
tried
to
kill
me
.
As
we
were
holding
him
a
strange
thing
*NL*
happened
.
He
suddenly
redoubled
his
efforts
,
and
then
as
suddenly
grew
*NL*
calm
.
I
looked
round
instinctively
,
but
could
see
nothing
.
Then
I
caught
*NL*
the
patient
's
eye
and
followed
it
,
but
could
trace
nothing
as
it
looked
*NL*
into
the
moonlit
sky
except
a
big
bat
,
which
was
flapping
its
silent
and
*NL*
ghostly
way
to
the
west
.
Bats
usually
wheel
and
flit
about
,
but
this
one
*NL*
seemed
to
go
straight
on
,
as
if
it
knew
where
it
was
bound
for
or
had
*NL*
some
intention
of
its
own
.
The
patient
grew
calmer
every
instant
,
and
*NL*
presently
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
tie
me
;
I
shall
go
quietly
!
''
Without
trouble
we
came
back
*NL*
to
the
house
.
I
feel
there
is
something
ominous
in
his
calm
,
and
shall
*NL*
not
forget
this
night

--
I
must
imitate
Mina
,
and
keep
writing
things
*NL*
down
.
Then
we
can
have
long
talks
when
we
do
meet
.
I
wonder
when
it
will
*NL*
be
.
I
wish
she
were
with
me
again
,
for
I
feel
so
unhappy
.
Last
night
I
*NL*
seemed
to
be
dreaming
again
just
as
I
was
at
Whitby
.
Perhaps
it
is
the
*NL*
change
of
air
,
or
getting
home
again
.
It
is
all
dark
and
horrid
to
me
,
*NL*
for
I
can
remember
nothing
;
but
I
am
full
of
vague
fear
,
and
I
feel
so
*NL*
weak
and
worn
out
.
When
Arthur
came
to
lunch
he
looked
quite
grieved
*NL*
when
he
saw
me
,
and
I
had
n't
the
spirit
to
try
to
be
cheerful
.
I
wonder
*NL*
if
I
could
sleep
in
mother
's
room
to-night
.
I
shall
make
an
excuse
and
*NL*

Another
bad
night
.
Mother
did
not
seem
to
take
to
my
*NL*
proposal
.
She
seems
not
too
well
herself
,
and
doubtless
she
fears
to
*NL*
worry
me
.
I
tried
to
keep
awake
,
and
succeeded
for
a
while
;
but
when
the
*NL*
clock
struck
twelve
it
waked
me
from
a
doze
,
so
I
must
have
been
falling
*NL*
asleep
.
There
was
a
sort
of
scratching
or
flapping
at
the
window
,
but
I
*NL*
did
not
mind
it
,
and
as
I
remember
no
more
,
I
suppose
I
must
then
have
*NL*
fallen
asleep
.
More
bad
dreams
.
I
wish
I
could
remember
them
.
This
*NL*
morning
I
am
horribly
weak
.
My
face
is
ghastly
pale
,
and
my
throat
pains
*NL*
me
.
It
must
be
something
wrong
with
my
lungs
,
for
I
do
n't
seem
ever
to
*NL*
get
air
enough
.
I
shall
try
to
cheer
up
when
Arthur
comes
,
or
else
I
*NL*
know
he
will
be
miserable
to
see
me
so

My

*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
.
Lucy
is
ill
;
that
is
,
she
has
no
special
*NL*
disease
,
but
she
looks
awful
,
and
is
getting
worse
every
day
.
I
have
*NL*
asked
her
if
there
is
any
cause
;
I
do
not
dare
to
ask
her
mother
,
for
to
*NL*
disturb
the
poor
lady
's
mind
about
her
daughter
in
her
present
state

health
would
be
fatal

Mrs.

to
me
that
her
doom
is
*NL*
spoken
--
disease
of
the
heart
--
though
poor
Lucy
does
not
know
it
yet
.
I
*NL*
am
sure
that
there
is
something
preying
on
my
dear
girl
's
mind
.
I
am
*NL*
almost
distracted
when
I
think
of
her
;
to
look
at
her
gives
me
a
pang
.
I
*NL*
told
her
I
should
ask
you
to
see
her
,
and
though
she
demurred
at
*NL*
first
--
I

she
finally
consented

It

it
is
for

I

ask
,
or
you
to
act
.
You
are
to
come
to
lunch
at
*NL*
Hillingham
to-morrow
,
two
o'clock
,
so
as
not
to
arouse
any

in

Mrs.

after

Lucy
will
take
an
opportunity

being

I
shall
come
in

we

``
My

old
fellow
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
regard
to
Miss
Westenra
's
health
I
hasten
to
let
you
know
at
once
*NL*
that
in
my
opinion
there
is
not
any
functional
disturbance
or
any
malady
*NL*
that
I
know
of
.
At
the
same
time
,
I
am
not
by
any
means
satisfied
with
*NL*
her
appearance
;
she
is
woefully
different
from
what
she
was
when
I
saw
*NL*
her
last
.
Of
course
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
I
did
not
have
full
*NL*
opportunity
of
examination
such
as
I
should
wish
;
our
very
friendship
*NL*
makes
a
little
difficulty
which
not
even
medical
science
or
custom
can
*NL*
bridge
over
.
I
had
better
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
,
leaving
you
to
*NL*
draw
,
in
a
measure
,
your
own
conclusions
.
I
shall
then
say
what
I
have
*NL*
done
and
propose
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
Miss
Westenra
in
seemingly
gay
spirits
.
Her
mother
was
present
,
*NL*
and
in
a
few
seconds
I
made
up
my
mind
that
she
was
trying
all
she
knew
*NL*
to
mislead
her
mother
and
prevent
her
from
being
anxious
.
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
she
guesses
,
if
she
does
not
know
,
what
need
of
caution
there
is
.
*NL*
We
lunched
alone
,
and
as
we
all
exerted
ourselves
to
be
cheerful
,
we
*NL*
got
,
as
some
kind
of
reward
for
our
labours
,
some
real
cheerfulness
*NL*
amongst
us
.
Then
Mrs.
Westenra
went
to
lie
down
,
and
Lucy
was
left
with
*NL*
me
.
We
went
into
her
boudoir
,
and
till
we
got
there
her
gaiety
remained
,
*NL*
for
the
servants
were
coming
and
going
.
As
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
,
*NL*
however
,
the
mask
fell
from
her
face
,
and
she
sank
down
into
a
chair
*NL*
with
a
great
sigh
,
and
hid
her
eyes
with
her
hand
.
When
I
saw
that
her
*NL*
high
spirits
had
failed
,
I
at
once
took
advantage
of
her
reaction
to
*NL*
make
a
diagnosis
.
She
said
to
me
very
sweetly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
can
not
tell
you
how
I
loathe
talking
about
myself
.
'
I
reminded
her
*NL*
that
a
doctor
's
confidence
was
sacred
,
but
that
you
were
grievously
*NL*
anxious
about
her
.
She
caught
on
to
my
meaning
at
once
,
and
settled
that
*NL*
matter
in
a
word
.
`
Tell
Arthur
everything
you
choose
.
I
do
not
care
for
*NL*
myself
,
but
all
for
him
!
'
So
I
am
quite
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
easily
see
that
she
is
somewhat
bloodless
,
but
I
could
not
see
*NL*
the
usual
anaemic
signs
,
and
by
a
chance
I
was
actually
able
to
test
the
*NL*
quality
of
her
blood
,
for
in
opening
a
window
which
was
stiff
a
cord
*NL*
gave
way
,
and
she
cut
her
hand
slightly
with
broken
glass
.
It
was
a
*NL*
slight
matter
in
itself
,
but
it
gave
me
an
evident
chance
,
and
I
secured
*NL*
a
few
drops
of
the
blood
and
have
analysed
them
.
The
qualitative
*NL*
analysis
gives
a
quite
normal
condition
,
and
shows
,
I
should
infer
,
in
*NL*
itself
a
vigorous
state
of
health
.
In
other
physical
matters
I
was
quite
*NL*
satisfied
that
there
is
no
need
for
anxiety
;
but
as
there
must
be
a
*NL*
cause
somewhere
,
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
must
be
something
*NL*
mental
.
She
complains
of
difficulty
in
breathing
satisfactorily
at
*NL*
times
,
and
of
heavy
,
lethargic
sleep
,
with
dreams
that
frighten
her
,
but
*NL*
regarding
which
she
can
remember
nothing
.
She
says
that
as
a
child
she
*NL*
used
to
walk
in
her
sleep
,
and
that
when
in
Whitby
the
habit
came
back
,
*NL*
and
that
once
she
walked
out
in
the
night
and
went
to
East
Cliff
,
where
*NL*
Miss
Murray
found
her
;
but
she
assures
me
that
of
late
the
habit
has
not
*NL*
returned
.
I
am
in
doubt
,
and
so
have
done
the
best
thing
I
know
of
;
I
*NL*
have
written
to
my
old
friend
and
master
,
Professor
Van
Helsing
,
of
*NL*
Amsterdam
,
who
knows
as
much
about
obscure
diseases
as
any
one
in
the
*NL*
world
.
I
have
asked
him
to
come
over
,
and
as
you
told
me
that
all
things
*NL*
were
to
be
at
your
charge
,
I
have
mentioned
to
him
who
you
are
and
your
*NL*
relations
to
Miss
Westenra
.
This
,
my
dear
fellow
,
is
in
obedience
to
*NL*
your
wishes
,
for
I
am
only
too
proud
and
happy
to
do
anything
I
can
for
*NL*
her
.
Van
Helsing
would
,
I
know
,
do
anything
for
me
for
a
personal
*NL*
reason
,
so
,
no
matter
on
what
ground
he
comes
,
we
must
accept
his
*NL*
wishes
.
He
is
a
seemingly
arbitrary
man
,
but
this
is
because
he
knows
*NL*
what
he
is
talking
about
better
than
any
one
else
.
He
is
a
philosopher
*NL*
and
a
metaphysician
,
and
one
of
the
most
advanced
scientists
of
his
day
;
*NL*
and
he
has
,
I
believe
,
an
absolutely
open
mind
.
This
,
with
an
iron
*NL*
nerve
,
a
temper
of
the
ice-brook
,
an
indomitable
resolution
,
*NL*
self-command
,
and
toleration
exalted
from
virtues
to
blessings
,
and
the
*NL*
kindliest
and
truest
heart
that
beats
--
these
form
his
equipment
for
the
*NL*
noble
work
that
he
is
doing
for
mankind
--
work
both
in
theory
and
*NL*
practice
,
for
his
views
are
as
wide
as
his
all-embracing
sympathy
.
I
*NL*
tell
you
these
facts
that
you
may
know
why
I
have
such
confidence
in
*NL*
him
.
I
have
asked
him
to
come
at
once
.
I
shall
see
Miss
Westenra
*NL*
to-morrow
again
.
She
is
to
meet
me
at
the
Stores
,
so
that
I
may
not
*NL*
alarm
her
mother
by
too
early
a
repetition
of
my
call

*NL*
aids
and
you
call
for
them
than
all
his
great

But
it
*NL*
is
pleasure
added
to
do
for
him
,
your
friend
;
it
is
to
you
that
I
come
.
*NL*
Have
then
rooms
for
me
at
the
Great
Eastern
Hotel
,
so
that
I
may
be
near
*NL*
to
hand
,
and
please
it
so
arrange
that
we
may
see
the
young
lady
not
too
*NL*
late
on
to-morrow
,
for
it
is
likely
that
I
may
have
to
return
here
that
*NL*
night
.
But
if
need
be
I
shall
come
again
in
three
days
,
and
stay
longer
*NL*
if
it
must
.
Till
then
good-bye
,
my
friend

My

``
Van
Helsing
has
come
and
gone
.
He
came
on
with
me
to
Hillingham
,
and
*NL*
found
that
,
by
Lucy
's
discretion
,
her
mother
was
lunching
out
,
so
that
*NL*
we
were
alone
with
her
.
Van
Helsing
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
*NL*
the
patient
.
He
is
to
report
to
me
,
and
I
shall
advise
you
,
for
of
*NL*
course
I
was
not
present
all
the
time
.
He
is
,
I
fear
,
much
concerned
,
*NL*
but
says
he
must
think
.
When
I
told
him
of
our
friendship
and
how
you
*NL*
trust
to
me
in
the
matter
,
he
said
:
`
You
must
tell
him
all
you
think
.
*NL*
Tell
him
what
I
think
,
if
you
can
guess
it
,
if
you
will
.
Nay
,
I
am
not
*NL*
jesting
.
This
is
no
jest
,
but
life
and
death
,
perhaps
more
.
'
I
asked
*NL*
what
he
meant
by
that
,
for
he
was
very
serious
.
This
was
when
we
had
*NL*
come
back
to
town
,
and
he
was
having
a
cup
of
tea
before
starting
on
his
*NL*
return
to
Amsterdam
.
He
would
not
give
me
any
further
clue
.
You
must
not
*NL*
be
angry
with
me
,
Art
,
because
his
very
reticence
means
that
all
his
*NL*
brains
are
working
for
her
good
.
He
will
speak
plainly
enough
when
the
*NL*
time
comes
,
be
sure
.
So
I
told
him
I
would
simply
write
an
account
of
*NL*
our
visit
,
just
as
if
I
were
doing
a
descriptive
special
article
for
*NL*
_
The
Daily
Telegraph
_
.
He
seemed
not
to
notice
,
but
remarked
that
the
*NL*
smuts
in
London
were
not
quite
so
bad
as
they
used
to
be
when
he
was
a
*NL*
student
here
.
I
am
to
get
his
report
to-morrow
if
he
can
possibly
make
*NL*
it
.
In
any
case
I
am
to
have
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
to
the
visit
.
Lucy
was
more
cheerful
than
on
the
day
I
first
*NL*
saw
her
,
and
certainly
looked
better
.
She
had
lost
something
of
the
*NL*
ghastly
look
that
so
upset
you
,
and
her
breathing
was
normal
.
She
was
*NL*
very
sweet
to
the
professor
-LRB-
as
she
always
is
-RRB-
,
and
tried
to
make
him
*NL*
feel
at
ease
;
though
I
could
see
that
the
poor
girl
was
making
a
hard
*NL*
struggle
for
it
.
I
believe
Van
Helsing
saw
it
,
too
,
for
I
saw
the
quick
*NL*
look
under
his
bushy
brows
that
I
knew
of
old
.
Then
he
began
to
chat
of
*NL*
all
things
except
ourselves
and
diseases
and
with
such
an
infinite
*NL*
geniality
that
I
could
see
poor
Lucy
's
pretense
of
animation
merge
into
*NL*
reality
.
Then
,
without
any
seeming
change
,
he
brought
the
conversation
*NL*
gently
round
to
his
visit
,
and
suavely
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
My
dear
young
miss
,
I
have
the
so
great
pleasure
because
you
are
so
*NL*
much
beloved
.
That
is
much
,
my
dear
,
ever
were
there
that
which
I
do
not
*NL*
see
.
They
told
me
you
were
down
in
the
spirit
,
and
that
you
were
of
a
*NL*
ghastly
pale
.
To
them
I
say
:
``
Pouf
!
''
'
And
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
me
*NL*
and
went
on
:
`
But
you
and
I
shall
show
them
how
wrong
they
are
.
How
can
*NL*
he
'
--
and
he
pointed
at
me
with
the
same
look
and
gesture
as
that
with
*NL*
which
once
he
pointed
me
out
to
his
class
,
on
,
or
rather
after
,
a
*NL*
particular
occasion
which
he
never
fails
to
remind
me
of
--
`
know
anything
*NL*
of
a
young
ladies
?
He
has
his
madams
to
play
with
,
and
to
bring
them
*NL*
back
to
happiness
,
and
to
those
that
love
them
.
It
is
much
to
do
,
and
,
*NL*
oh
,
but
there
are
rewards
,
in
that
we
can
bestow
such
happiness
.
But
the
*NL*
young
ladies
!
He
has
no
wife
nor
daughter
,
and
the
young
do
not
tell
*NL*
themselves
to
the
young
,
but
to
the
old
,
like
me
,
who
have
known
so
many
*NL*
sorrows
and
the
causes
of
them
.
So
,
my
dear
,
we
will
send
him
away
to
*NL*
smoke
the
cigarette
in
the
garden
,
whiles
you
and
I
have
little
talk
all
*NL*
to
ourselves
.
'
I
took
the
hint
,
and
strolled
about
,
and
presently
the
*NL*
professor
came
to
the
window
and
called
me
in
.
He
looked
grave
,
but
*NL*
said
:
'
I
have
made
careful
examination
,
but
there
is
no
functional
*NL*
cause
.
With
you
I
agree
that
there
has
been
much
blood
lost
;
it
has
*NL*
been
,
but
is
not
.
But
the
conditions
of
her
are
in
no
way
anaemic
.
I
have
*NL*
asked
her
to
send
me
her
maid
,
that
I
may
ask
just
one
or
two
question
,
*NL*
that
so
I
may
not
chance
to
miss
nothing
.
I
know
well
what
she
will
say
.
*NL*
And
yet
there
is
cause
;
there
is
always
cause
for
everything
.
I
must
go
*NL*
back
home
and
think
.
You
must
send
to
me
the
telegram
every
day
;
and
if
*NL*
there
be
cause
I
shall
come
again
.
The
disease
--
for
not
to
be
all
well
*NL*
is
a
disease
--
interest
me
,
and
the
sweet
young
dear
,
she
interest
me
*NL*
too
.
She
charm
me
,
and
for
her
,
if
not
for
you
or
disease
,
I
come
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
tell
you
,
he
would
not
say
a
word
more
,
even
when
we
were
alone
.
*NL*
And
so
now
,
Art
,
you
know
all
I
know
.
I
shall
keep
stern
watch
.
I
trust
*NL*
your
poor
father
is
rallying
.
It
must
be
a
terrible
thing
to
you
,
my
*NL*
dear
old
fellow
,
to
be
placed
in
such
a
position
between
two
people
who
*NL*
are
both
so
dear
to
you
.
I
know
your
idea
of
duty
to
your
father
,
and
*NL*
you
are
right
to
stick
to
it
;
but
,
if
need
be
,
I
shall
send
you
word
to
*NL*
come
at
once
to
Lucy
;
so
do
not
be
over-anxious
unless
you
hear
from

me

--
Zooephagous
patient
still
keeps
up
our
interest
in
him
.
*NL*
He
had
only
one
outburst
and
that
was
yesterday
at
an
unusual
time
.
Just
*NL*
before
the
stroke
of
noon
he
began
to
grow
restless
.
The
attendant
knew
*NL*
the
symptoms
,
and
at
once
summoned
aid
.
Fortunately
the
men
came
at
a
*NL*
run
,
and
were
just
in
time
,
for
at
the
stroke
of
noon
he
became
so
*NL*
violent
that
it
took
all
their
strength
to
hold
him
.
In
about
five
*NL*
minutes
,
however
,
he
began
to
get
more
and
more
quiet
,
and
finally
sank
*NL*
into
a
sort
of
melancholy
,
in
which
state
he
has
remained
up
to
now
.
The
*NL*
attendant
tells
me
that
his
screams
whilst
in
the
paroxysm
were
really
*NL*
appalling
;
I
found
my
hands
full
when
I
got
in
,
attending
to
some
of
the
*NL*
other
patients
who
were
frightened
by
him
.
Indeed
,
I
can
quite
*NL*
understand
the
effect
,
for
the
sounds
disturbed
even
me
,
though
I
was
*NL*
some
distance
away
.
It
is
now
after
the
dinner-hour
of
the
asylum
,
and
*NL*
as
yet
my
patient
sits
in
a
corner
brooding
,
with
a
dull
,
sullen
,
*NL*
woe-begone
look
in
his
face
,
which
seems
rather
to
indicate
than
to
show
*NL*
something
directly
.
I
can
not
quite
understand
it
.

_
Later
.
_
--
Another
change
in
my
patient
.
At
five
o'clock
I
looked
in
on
*NL*
him
,
and
found
him
seemingly
as
happy
and
contented
as
he
used
to
be
.
He
*NL*
was
catching
flies
and
eating
them
,
and
was
keeping
note
of
his
capture
*NL*
by
making
nail-marks
on
the
edge
of
the
door
between
the
ridges
of
*NL*
padding
.
When
he
saw
me
,
he
came
over
and
apologised
for
his
bad
*NL*
conduct
,
and
asked
me
in
a
very
humble
,
cringing
way
to
be
led
back
to
*NL*
his
own
room
and
to
have
his
note-book
again
.
I
thought
it
well
to
*NL*
humour
him
:
so
he
is
back
in
his
room
with
the
window
open
.
He
has
the
*NL*
sugar
of
his
tea
spread
out
on
the
window-sill
,
and
is
reaping
quite
a
*NL*
harvest
of
flies
.
He
is
not
now
eating
them
,
but
putting
them
into
a
*NL*
box
,
as
of
old
,
and
is
already
examining
the
corners
of
his
room
to
find
*NL*
a
spider
.
I
tried
to
get
him
to
talk
about
the
past
few
days
,
for
any
*NL*
clue
to
his
thoughts
would
be
of
immense
help
to
me
;
but
he
would
not
*NL*
rise
.
For
a
moment
or
two
he
looked
very
sad
,
and
said
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
far-away
voice
,
as
though
saying
it
rather
to
himself
than
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
over
!
all
over
!
He
has
deserted
me
.
No
hope
for
me
now
unless
I
do
*NL*
it
for
myself
!
''
Then
suddenly
turning
to
me
in
a
resolute
way
,
he
said
:
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
wo
n't
you
be
very
good
to
me
and
let
me
have
a
little
more
*NL*
sugar
?
I
think
it
would
be
good
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
flies
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
The
flies
like
it
,
too
,
and
I
like
the
flies
;
therefore
I
like
*NL*
it
.
''
And
there
are
people
who
know
so
little
as
to
think
that
madmen
do
*NL*
not
argue
.
I
procured
him
a
double
supply
,
and
left
him
as
happy
a
man
*NL*
as
,
I
suppose
,
any
in
the
world
.
I
wish
I
could
fathom
his
mind
.

_
Midnight
.
_
--
Another
change
in
him
.
I
had
been
to
see
Miss
Westenra
,
*NL*
whom
I
found
much
better
,
and
had
just
returned
,
and
was
standing
at
our
*NL*
own
gate
looking
at
the
sunset
,
when
once
more
I
heard
him
yelling
.
As
*NL*
his
room
is
on
this
side
of
the
house
,
I
could
hear
it
better
than
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
It
was
a
shock
to
me
to
turn
from
the
wonderful
smoky
*NL*
beauty
of
a
sunset
over
London
,
with
its
lurid
lights
and
inky
shadows
*NL*
and
all
the
marvellous
tints
that
come
on
foul
clouds
even
as
on
foul
*NL*
water
,
and
to
realise
all
the
grim
sternness
of
my
own
cold
stone
*NL*
building
,
with
its
wealth
of
breathing
misery
,
and
my
own
desolate
heart
*NL*
to
endure
it
all
.
I
reached
him
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down
,
and
from
*NL*
his
window
saw
the
red
disc
sink
.
As
it
sank
he
became
less
and
less
*NL*
frenzied
;
and
just
as
it
dipped
he
slid
from
the
hands
that
held
him
,
an
*NL*
inert
mass
,
on
the
floor
.
It
is
wonderful
,
however
,
what
intellectual
*NL*
recuperative
power
lunatics
have
,
for
within
a
few
minutes
he
stood
up
*NL*
quite
calmly
and
looked
around
him
.
I
signalled
to
the
attendants
not
to
*NL*
hold
him
,
for
I
was
anxious
to
see
what
he
would
do
.
He
went
straight
*NL*
over
to
the
window
and
brushed
out
the
crumbs
of
sugar
;
then
he
took
his
*NL*
fly-box
,
and
emptied
it
outside
,
and
threw
away
the
box
;
then
he
shut
*NL*
the
window
,
and
crossing
over
,
sat
down
on
his
bed
.
All
this
surprised
*NL*
me
,
so
I
asked
him
:
``
Are
you
not
going
to
keep
flies
any
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
am
sick
of
all
that
rubbish
!
''
He
certainly
is
a
*NL*
wonderfully
interesting
study
.
I
wish
I
could
get
some
glimpse
of
his
*NL*
mind
or
of
the
cause
of
his
sudden
passion
.
Stop
;
there
may
be
a
clue
*NL*
after
all
,
if
we
can
find
why
to-day
his
paroxysms
came
on
at
high
noon
*NL*
and
at
sunset
.
Can
it
be
that
there
is
a
malign
influence
of
the
sun
at
*NL*
periods
which
affects
certain
natures
--
as
at
times
the
moon
does
others
?

My
dear
Art
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
news
to-day
is
not
so
good
.
Lucy
this
morning
had
gone
back
a
bit
.
*NL*
There
is
,
however
,
one
good
thing
which
has
arisen
from
it
;
Mrs.
*NL*
Westenra
was
naturally
anxious
concerning
Lucy
,
and
has
consulted
me
*NL*
professionally
about
her
.
I
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
,
and
told
*NL*
her
that
my
old
master
,
Van
Helsing
,
the
great
specialist
,
was
coming
to
*NL*
stay
with
me
,
and
that
I
would
put
her
in
his
charge
conjointly
with
*NL*
myself
;
so
now
we
can
come
and
go
without
alarming
her
unduly
,
for
a
*NL*
shock
to
her
would
mean
sudden
death
,
and
this
,
in
Lucy
's
weak
*NL*
condition
,
might
be
disastrous
to
her
.
We
are
hedged
in
with
*NL*
difficulties
,
all
of
us
,
my
poor
old
fellow
;
but
,
please
God
,
we
shall
*NL*
come
through
them
all
right
.
If
any
need
I
shall
write
,
so
that
,
if
you
*NL*
do
not
hear
from
me
,
take
it
for
granted
that
I
am
simply
waiting
for
*NL*
news
.
In
haste
*NL*
*NL*
Yours
ever
,

--
The
first
thing
Van
Helsing
said
to
me
when
we
met
at
*NL*
Liverpool
Street
was
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
said
anything
to
our
young
friend
the
lover
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
waited
till
I
had
seen
you
,
as
I
said
in
my
telegram
.
I
*NL*
wrote
him
a
letter
simply
telling
him
that
you
were
coming
,
as
Miss
*NL*
Westenra
was
not
so
well
,
and
that
I
should
let
him
know
if
need
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
,
my
friend
,
''
he
said
,
``
quite
right
!
Better
he
not
know
as
yet
;
*NL*
perhaps
he
shall
never
know
.
I
pray
so
;
but
if
it
be
needed
,
then
he
*NL*
shall
know
all
.
And
,
my
good
friend
John
,
let
me
caution
you
.
You
deal
*NL*
with
the
madmen
.
All
men
are
mad
in
some
way
or
the
other
;
and
inasmuch
*NL*
as
you
deal
discreetly
with
your
madmen
,
so
deal
with
God
's
madmen
,
*NL*
too
--
the
rest
of
the
world
.
You
tell
not
your
madmen
what
you
do
nor
why
*NL*
you
do
it
;
you
tell
them
not
what
you
think
.
So
you
shall
keep
knowledge
*NL*
in
its
place
,
where
it
may
rest
--
where
it
may
gather
its
kind
around
it
*NL*
and
breed
.
You
and
I
shall
keep
as
yet
what
we
know
here
,
and
here
.
''
He
*NL*
touched
me
on
the
heart
and
on
the
forehead
,
and
then
touched
himself
*NL*
the
same
way
.
``
I
have
for
myself
thoughts
at
the
present
.
Later
I
shall
*NL*
unfold
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
now
?
''
I
asked
.
``
It
may
do
some
good
;
we
may
arrive
at
some
*NL*
decision
.
''
He
stopped
and
looked
at
me
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
John
,
when
the
corn
is
grown
,
even
before
it
has
*NL*
ripened
--
while
the
milk
of
its
mother-earth
is
in
him
,
and
the
sunshine
*NL*
has
not
yet
begun
to
paint
him
with
his
gold
,
the
husbandman
he
pull
the
*NL*
ear
and
rub
him
between
his
rough
hands
,
and
blow
away
the
green
chaff
,
*NL*
and
say
to
you
:
`
Look
!
he
's
good
corn
;
he
will
make
good
crop
when
the
*NL*
time
comes
.
'
''
I
did
not
see
the
application
,
and
told
him
so
.
For
reply
*NL*
he
reached
over
and
took
my
ear
in
his
hand
and
pulled
it
playfully
,
as
*NL*
he
used
long
ago
to
do
at
lectures
,
and
said
:
``
The
good
husbandman
tell
*NL*
you
so
then
because
he
knows
,
but
not
till
then
.
But
you
do
not
find
the
*NL*
good
husbandman
dig
up
his
planted
corn
to
see
if
he
grow
;
that
is
for
*NL*
the
children
who
play
at
husbandry
,
and
not
for
those
who
take
it
as
of
*NL*
the
work
of
their
life
.
See
you
now
,
friend
John
?
I
have
sown
my
corn
,
*NL*
and
Nature
has
her
work
to
do
in
making
it
sprout
;
if
he
sprout
at
all
,
*NL*
there
's
some
promise
;
and
I
wait
till
the
ear
begins
to
swell
.
''
He
broke
*NL*
off
,
for
he
evidently
saw
that
I
understood
.
Then
he
went
on
,
and
very
*NL*
gravely
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
always
a
careful
student
,
and
your
case-book
was
ever
more
*NL*
full
than
the
rest
.
You
were
only
student
then
;
now
you
are
master
,
and
*NL*
I
trust
that
good
habit
have
not
fail
.
Remember
,
my
friend
,
that
*NL*
knowledge
is
stronger
than
memory
,
and
we
should
not
trust
the
weaker
.
*NL*
Even
if
you
have
not
kept
the
good
practise
,
let
me
tell
you
that
this
*NL*
case
of
our
dear
miss
is
one
that
may
be
--
mind
,
I
say
_
may
be
_
--
of
such
*NL*
interest
to
us
and
others
that
all
the
rest
may
not
make
him
kick
the
*NL*
beam
,
as
your
peoples
say
.
Take
then
good
note
of
it
.
Nothing
is
too
*NL*
small
.
I
counsel
you
,
put
down
in
record
even
your
doubts
and
surmises
.
*NL*
Hereafter
it
may
be
of
interest
to
you
to
see
how
true
you
guess
.
We
*NL*
learn
from
failure
,
not
from
success
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
described
Lucy
's
symptoms
--
the
same
as
before
,
but
infinitely
*NL*
more
marked
--
he
looked
very
grave
,
but
said
nothing
.
He
took
with
him
a
*NL*
bag
in
which
were
many
instruments
and
drugs
,
``
the
ghastly
paraphernalia
*NL*
of
our
beneficial
trade
,
''
as
he
once
called
,
in
one
of
his
lectures
,
the
*NL*
equipment
of
a
professor
of
the
healing
craft
.
When
we
were
shown
in
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Westenra
met
us
.
She
was
alarmed
,
but
not
nearly
so
much
as
I
*NL*
expected
to
find
her
.
Nature
in
one
of
her
beneficent
moods
has
ordained
*NL*
that
even
death
has
some
antidote
to
its
own
terrors
.
Here
,
in
a
case
*NL*
where
any
shock
may
prove
fatal
,
matters
are
so
ordered
that
,
from
some
*NL*
cause
or
other
,
the
things
not
personal
--
even
the
terrible
change
in
her
*NL*
daughter
to
whom
she
is
so
attached
--
do
not
seem
to
reach
her
.
It
is
*NL*
something
like
the
way
Dame
Nature
gathers
round
a
foreign
body
an
*NL*
envelope
of
some
insensitive
tissue
which
can
protect
from
evil
that
*NL*
which
it
would
otherwise
harm
by
contact
.
If
this
be
an
ordered
*NL*
selfishness
,
then
we
should
pause
before
we
condemn
any
one
for
the
vice
*NL*
of
egoism
,
for
there
may
be
deeper
root
for
its
causes
than
we
have
*NL*
knowledge
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
used
my
knowledge
of
this
phase
of
spiritual
pathology
,
and
laid
down
*NL*
a
rule
that
she
should
not
be
present
with
Lucy
or
think
of
her
illness
*NL*
more
than
was
absolutely
required
.
She
assented
readily
,
so
readily
that
*NL*
I
saw
again
the
hand
of
Nature
fighting
for
life
.
Van
Helsing
and
I
were
*NL*
shown
up
to
Lucy
's
room
.
If
I
was
shocked
when
I
saw
her
yesterday
,
I
*NL*
was
horrified
when
I
saw
her
to-day
.
She
was
ghastly
,
chalkily
pale
;
the
*NL*
red
seemed
to
have
gone
even
from
her
lips
and
gums
,
and
the
bones
of
*NL*
her
face
stood
out
prominently
;
her
breathing
was
painful
to
see
or
*NL*
hear
.
Van
Helsing
's
face
grew
set
as
marble
,
and
his
eyebrows
converged
*NL*
till
they
almost
touched
over
his
nose
.
Lucy
lay
motionless
,
and
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
have
strength
to
speak
,
so
for
a
while
we
were
all
silent
.
Then
*NL*
Van
Helsing
beckoned
to
me
,
and
we
went
gently
out
of
the
room
.
The
*NL*
instant
we
had
closed
the
door
he
stepped
quickly
along
the
passage
to
*NL*
the
next
door
,
which
was
open
.
Then
he
pulled
me
quickly
in
with
him
and
*NL*
closed
the
door
.
``
My
God
!
''
he
said
;
``
this
is
dreadful
.
There
is
no
time
*NL*
to
be
lost
.
She
will
die
for
sheer
want
of
blood
to
keep
the
heart
's
*NL*
action
as
it
should
be
.
There
must
be
transfusion
of
blood
at
once
.
Is
*NL*
it
you
or
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
younger
and
stronger
,
Professor
.
It
must
be
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
get
ready
at
once
.
I
will
bring
up
my
bag
.
I
am
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
downstairs
with
him
,
and
as
we
were
going
there
was
a
knock
at
*NL*
the
hall-door
.
When
we
reached
the
hall
the
maid
had
just
opened
the
*NL*
door
,
and
Arthur
was
stepping
quickly
in
.
He
rushed
up
to
me
,
saying
in
*NL*
an
eager
whisper
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jack
,
I
was
so
anxious
.
I
read
between
the
lines
of
your
letter
,
and
*NL*
have
been
in
an
agony
.
The
dad
was
better
,
so
I
ran
down
here
to
see
for
*NL*
myself
.
Is
not
that
gentleman
Dr.
Van
Helsing
?
I
am
so
thankful
to
you
,
*NL*
sir
,
for
coming
.
''
When
first
the
Professor
's
eye
had
lit
upon
him
he
had
*NL*
been
angry
at
his
interruption
at
such
a
time
;
but
now
,
as
he
took
in
*NL*
his
stalwart
proportions
and
recognised
the
strong
young
manhood
which
*NL*
seemed
to
emanate
from
him
,
his
eyes
gleamed
.
Without
a
pause
he
said
to
*NL*
him
gravely
as
he
held
out
his
hand
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
you
have
come
in
time
.
You
are
the
lover
of
our
dear
miss
.
She
is
*NL*
bad
,
very
,
very
bad
.
Nay
,
my
child
,
do
not
go
like
that
.
''
For
he
*NL*
suddenly
grew
pale
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
almost
fainting
.
``
You
are
to
*NL*
help
her
.
You
can
do
more
than
any
that
live
,
and
your
courage
is
your
*NL*
best
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
?
''
asked
Arthur
hoarsely
.
``
Tell
me
,
and
I
shall
do
it
.
My
*NL*
life
is
hers
,
and
I
would
give
the
last
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
for
*NL*
her
.
''
The
Professor
has
a
strongly
humorous
side
,
and
I
could
from
old
*NL*
knowledge
detect
a
trace
of
its
origin
in
his
answer
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
young
sir
,
I
do
not
ask
so
much
as
that
--
not
the
last
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
do
?
''
There
was
fire
in
his
eyes
,
and
his
open
nostril
*NL*
quivered
with
intent
.
Van
Helsing
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
.
``
Come
!
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
You
are
a
man
,
and
it
is
a
man
we
want
.
You
are
better
than
*NL*
me
,
better
than
my
friend
John
.
''
Arthur
looked
bewildered
,
and
the
*NL*
Professor
went
on
by
explaining
in
a
kindly
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
miss
is
bad
,
very
bad
.
She
wants
blood
,
and
blood
she
must
have
*NL*
or
die
.
My
friend
John
and
I
have
consulted
;
and
we
are
about
to
perform
*NL*
what
we
call
transfusion
of
blood
--
to
transfer
from
full
veins
of
one
to
*NL*
the
empty
veins
which
pine
for
him
.
John
was
to
give
his
blood
,
as
he
is
*NL*
the
more
young
and
strong
than
me
''
--
here
Arthur
took
my
hand
and
wrung
*NL*
it
hard
in
silence
--
``
but
,
now
you
are
here
,
you
are
more
good
than
us
,
*NL*
old
or
young
,
who
toil
much
in
the
world
of
thought
.
Our
nerves
are
not
*NL*
so
calm
and
our
blood
not
so
bright
than
yours
!
''
Arthur
turned
to
him
*NL*
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
only
knew
how
gladly
I
would
die
for
her
you
would
*NL*
understand
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
,
with
a
sort
of
choke
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
boy
!
''
said
Van
Helsing
.
``
In
the
not-so-far-off
you
will
be
happy
*NL*
that
you
have
done
all
for
her
you
love
.
Come
now
and
be
silent
.
You
*NL*
shall
kiss
her
once
before
it
is
done
,
but
then
you
must
go
;
and
you
*NL*
must
leave
at
my
sign
.
Say
no
word
to
Madame
;
you
know
how
it
is
with
*NL*
her
!
There
must
be
no
shock
;
any
knowledge
of
this
would
be
one
.
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
went
up
to
Lucy
's
room
.
Arthur
by
direction
remained
outside
.
*NL*
Lucy
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
us
,
but
said
nothing
.
She
was
not
*NL*
asleep
,
but
she
was
simply
too
weak
to
make
the
effort
.
Her
eyes
spoke
*NL*
to
us
;
that
was
all
.
Van
Helsing
took
some
things
from
his
bag
and
laid
*NL*
them
on
a
little
table
out
of
sight
.
Then
he
mixed
a
narcotic
,
and
*NL*
coming
over
to
the
bed
,
said
cheerily
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
little
miss
,
here
is
your
medicine
.
Drink
it
off
,
like
a
good
*NL*
child
.
See
,
I
lift
you
so
that
to
swallow
is
easy
.
Yes
.
''
She
had
made
*NL*
the
effort
with
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
astonished
me
how
long
the
drug
took
to
act
.
This
,
in
fact
,
marked
*NL*
the
extent
of
her
weakness
.
The
time
seemed
endless
until
sleep
began
to
*NL*
flicker
in
her
eyelids
.
At
last
,
however
,
the
narcotic
began
to
manifest
*NL*
its
potency
;
and
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
.
When
the
Professor
was
*NL*
satisfied
he
called
Arthur
into
the
room
,
and
bade
him
strip
off
his
*NL*
coat
.
Then
he
added
:
``
You
may
take
that
one
little
kiss
whiles
I
bring
*NL*
over
the
table
.
Friend
John
,
help
to
me
!
''
So
neither
of
us
looked
whilst
*NL*
he
bent
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
turning
to
me
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
so
young
and
strong
and
of
blood
so
pure
that
we
need
not
*NL*
defibrinate
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
with
swiftness
,
but
with
absolute
method
,
Van
Helsing
performed
the
*NL*
operation
.
As
the
transfusion
went
on
something
like
life
seemed
to
come
*NL*
back
to
poor
Lucy
's
cheeks
,
and
through
Arthur
's
growing
pallor
the
joy
*NL*
of
his
face
seemed
absolutely
to
shine
.
After
a
bit
I
began
to
grow
*NL*
anxious
,
for
the
loss
of
blood
was
telling
on
Arthur
,
strong
man
as
he
*NL*
was
.
It
gave
me
an
idea
of
what
a
terrible
strain
Lucy
's
system
must
*NL*
have
undergone
that
what
weakened
Arthur
only
partially
restored
her
.
*NL*
But
the
Professor
's
face
was
set
,
and
he
stood
watch
in
hand
and
with
*NL*
his
eyes
fixed
now
on
the
patient
and
now
on
Arthur
.
I
could
hear
my
own
*NL*
heart
beat
.
Presently
he
said
in
a
soft
voice
:
``
Do
not
stir
an
instant
.
*NL*
It
is
enough
.
You
attend
him
;
I
will
look
to
her
.
''
When
all
was
over
I
*NL*
could
see
how
much
Arthur
was
weakened
.
I
dressed
the
wound
and
took
his
*NL*
arm
to
bring
him
away
,
when
Van
Helsing
spoke
without
turning
round
--
the
*NL*
man
seems
to
have
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
brave
lover
,
I
think
,
deserve
another
kiss
,
which
he
shall
have
*NL*
presently
.
''
And
as
he
had
now
finished
his
operation
,
he
adjusted
the
*NL*
pillow
to
the
patient
's
head
.
As
he
did
so
the
narrow
black
velvet
band
*NL*
which
she
seems
always
to
wear
round
her
throat
,
buckled
with
an
old
*NL*
diamond
buckle
which
her
lover
had
given
her
,
was
dragged
a
little
up
,
*NL*
and
showed
a
red
mark
on
her
throat
.
Arthur
did
not
notice
it
,
but
I
*NL*
could
hear
the
deep
hiss
of
indrawn
breath
which
is
one
of
Van
Helsing
's
*NL*
ways
of
betraying
emotion
.
He
said
nothing
at
the
moment
,
but
turned
to
*NL*
me
,
saying
:
``
Now
take
down
our
brave
young
lover
,
give
him
of
the
port
*NL*
wine
,
and
let
him
lie
down
a
while
.
He
must
then
go
home
and
rest
,
sleep
*NL*
much
and
eat
much
,
that
he
may
be
recruited
of
what
he
has
so
given
to
*NL*
his
love
.
He
must
not
stay
here
.
Hold
!
a
moment
.
I
may
take
it
,
sir
,
*NL*
that
you
are
anxious
of
result
.
Then
bring
it
with
you
that
in
all
ways
*NL*
the
operation
is
successful
.
You
have
saved
her
life
this
time
,
and
you
*NL*
can
go
home
and
rest
easy
in
mind
that
all
that
can
be
is
.
I
shall
tell
*NL*
her
all
when
she
is
well
;
she
shall
love
you
none
the
less
for
what
you
*NL*
have
done
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Arthur
had
gone
I
went
back
to
the
room
.
Lucy
was
sleeping
gently
,
*NL*
but
her
breathing
was
stronger
;
I
could
see
the
counterpane
move
as
her
*NL*
breast
heaved
.
By
the
bedside
sat
Van
Helsing
,
looking
at
her
intently
.
*NL*
The
velvet
band
again
covered
the
red
mark
.
I
asked
the
Professor
in
a
*NL*
whisper
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
make
of
that
mark
on
her
throat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
make
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
examined
it
yet
,
''
I
answered
,
and
then
and
there
proceeded
*NL*
to
loose
the
band
.
Just
over
the
external
jugular
vein
there
were
two
*NL*
punctures
,
not
large
,
but
not
wholesome-looking
.
There
was
no
sign
of
*NL*
disease
,
but
the
edges
were
white
and
worn-looking
,
as
if
by
some
*NL*
trituration
.
It
at
once
occurred
to
me
that
this
wound
,
or
whatever
it
*NL*
was
,
might
be
the
means
of
that
manifest
loss
of
blood
;
but
I
abandoned
*NL*
the
idea
as
soon
as
formed
,
for
such
a
thing
could
not
be
.
The
whole
bed
*NL*
would
have
been
drenched
to
a
scarlet
with
the
blood
which
the
girl
must
*NL*
have
lost
to
leave
such
a
pallor
as
she
had
before
the
transfusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Van
Helsing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
can
make
nothing
of
it
.
''
The
Professor
stood
up
.
``
I
*NL*
must
go
back
to
Amsterdam
to-night
,
''
he
said
.
``
There
are
books
and
*NL*
things
there
which
I
want
.
You
must
remain
here
all
the
night
,
and
you
*NL*
must
not
let
your
sight
pass
from
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
have
a
nurse
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
the
best
nurses
,
you
and
I
.
You
keep
watch
all
night
;
see
that
*NL*
she
is
well
fed
,
and
that
nothing
disturbs
her
.
You
must
not
sleep
all
*NL*
the
night
.
Later
on
we
can
sleep
,
you
and
I.
I
shall
be
back
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
.
And
then
we
may
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
begin
?
''
I
said
.
``
What
on
earth
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
!
''
he
answered
,
as
he
hurried
out
.
He
came
back
a
moment
*NL*
later
and
put
his
head
inside
the
door
and
said
with
warning
finger
held
*NL*
up
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
she
is
your
charge
.
If
you
leave
her
,
and
harm
befall
,
you
*NL*
shall
not
sleep
easy
hereafter
!

8
September

_
--
I
sat
up
all
night
with
Lucy
.
The
opiate
worked
itself
*NL*
off
towards
dusk
,
and
she
waked
naturally
;
she
looked
a
different
being
*NL*
from
what
she
had
been
before
the
operation
.
Her
spirits
even
were
good
,
*NL*
and
she
was
full
of
a
happy
vivacity
,
but
I
could
see
evidences
of
the
*NL*
absolute
prostration
which
she
had
undergone
.
When
I
told
Mrs.
Westenra
*NL*
that
Dr.
Van
Helsing
had
directed
that
I
should
sit
up
with
her
she
*NL*
almost
pooh-poohed
the
idea
,
pointing
out
her
daughter
's
renewed
*NL*
strength
and
excellent
spirits
.
I
was
firm
,
however
,
and
made
*NL*
preparations
for
my
long
vigil
.
When
her
maid
had
prepared
her
for
the
*NL*
night
I
came
in
,
having
in
the
meantime
had
supper
,
and
took
a
seat
by
*NL*
the
bedside
.
She
did
not
in
any
way
make
objection
,
but
looked
at
me
*NL*
gratefully
whenever
I
caught
her
eye
.
After
a
long
spell
she
seemed
*NL*
sinking
off
to
sleep
,
but
with
an
effort
seemed
to
pull
herself
together
*NL*
and
shook
it
off
.
This
was
repeated
several
times
,
with
greater
effort
*NL*
and
with
shorter
pauses
as
the
time
moved
on
.
It
was
apparent
that
she
*NL*
did
not
want
to
sleep
,
so
I
tackled
the
subject
at
once
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
am
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
to
go
to
sleep
!
Why
so
?
It
is
the
boon
we
all
crave
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
not
if
you
were
like
me
--
if
sleep
was
to
you
a
presage
of
horror
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
presage
of
horror
!
What
on
earth
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
And
that
is
what
is
so
terrible
.
All
*NL*
this
weakness
comes
to
me
in
sleep
;
until
I
dread
the
very
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
girl
,
you
may
sleep
to-night
.
I
am
here
watching
you
,
and
*NL*
I
can
promise
that
nothing
will
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
can
trust
you
!
''
I
seized
the
opportunity
,
and
said
:
``
I
promise
*NL*
you
that
if
I
see
any
evidence
of
bad
dreams
I
will
wake
you
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
?
Oh
,
will
you
really
?
How
good
you
are
to
me
.
Then
I
will
*NL*
sleep
!
''
And
almost
at
the
word
she
gave
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
,
and
sank
*NL*
back
,
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
night
long
I
watched
by
her
.
She
never
stirred
,
but
slept
on
and
on
*NL*
in
a
deep
,
tranquil
,
life-giving
,
health-giving
sleep
.
Her
lips
were
*NL*
slightly
parted
,
and
her
breast
rose
and
fell
with
the
regularity
of
a
*NL*
pendulum
.
There
was
a
smile
on
her
face
,
and
it
was
evident
that
no
bad
*NL*
dreams
had
come
to
disturb
her
peace
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
early
morning
her
maid
came
,
and
I
left
her
in
her
care
and
took
*NL*
myself
back
home
,
for
I
was
anxious
about
many
things
.
I
sent
a
short
*NL*
wire
to
Van
Helsing
and
to
Arthur
,
telling
them
of
the
excellent
result
*NL*
of
the
operation
.
My
own
work
,
with
its
manifold
arrears
,
took
me
all
*NL*
day
to
clear
off
;
it
was
dark
when
I
was
able
to
inquire
about
my
*NL*
zooephagous
patient
.
The
report
was
good
;
he
had
been
quite
quiet
for
the
*NL*
past
day
and
night
.
A
telegram
came
from
Van
Helsing
at
Amsterdam
whilst
*NL*
I
was
at
dinner
,
suggesting
that
I
should
be
at
Hillingham
to-night
,
as
*NL*
it
might
be
well
to
be
at
hand
,
and
stating
that
he
was
leaving
by
the
*NL*
night
mail
and
would
join
me
early
in
the
morning
.

I
was
pretty
tired
and
worn
out
when
I
got
to
*NL*
Hillingham
.
For
two
nights
I
had
hardly
had
a
wink
of
sleep
,
and
my
*NL*
brain
was
beginning
to
feel
that
numbness
which
marks
cerebral
*NL*
exhaustion
.
Lucy
was
up
and
in
cheerful
spirits
.
When
she
shook
hands
*NL*
with
me
she
looked
sharply
in
my
face
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
sitting
up
to-night
for
you
.
You
are
worn
out
.
I
am
quite
well
*NL*
again
;
indeed
,
I
am
;
and
if
there
is
to
be
any
sitting
up
,
it
is
I
who
*NL*
will
sit
up
with
you
.
''
I
would
not
argue
the
point
,
but
went
and
had
my
*NL*
supper
.
Lucy
came
with
me
,
and
,
enlivened
by
her
charming
presence
,
I
*NL*
made
an
excellent
meal
,
and
had
a
couple
of
glasses
of
the
more
than
*NL*
excellent
port
.
Then
Lucy
took
me
upstairs
,
and
showed
me
a
room
next
*NL*
her
own
,
where
a
cozy
fire
was
burning
.
``
Now
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
must
stay
*NL*
here
.
I
shall
leave
this
door
open
and
my
door
too
.
You
can
lie
on
the
*NL*
sofa
for
I
know
that
nothing
would
induce
any
of
you
doctors
to
go
to
*NL*
bed
whilst
there
is
a
patient
above
the
horizon
.
If
I
want
anything
I
*NL*
shall
call
out
,
and
you
can
come
to
me
at
once
.
''
I
could
not
but
*NL*
acquiesce
,
for
I
was
``
dog-tired
,
''
and
could
not
have
sat
up
had
I
tried
.
*NL*
So
,
on
her
renewing
her
promise
to
call
me
if
she
should
want
anything
,
*NL*
I
lay
on
the
sofa
,
and
forgot
all
about
everything

I
feel
so
happy
to-night

I
have
been
so
miserably
weak
,
*NL*
that
to
be
able
to
think
and
move
about
is
like
feeling
sunshine
after

a
long

wind
out

sky

Somehow
Arthur
feels
very
,
*NL*
very
close
to
me

I
seem
to
feel
his
presence
warm
about
me

I
suppose
*NL*
it
is
that
sickness
and
weakness
are
selfish
things
and
turn
our
inner

sympathy
on
ourselves

whilst
health
and
strength
give
Love
*NL*
rein
,
and
in
thought

feeling
he
can
wander
where
he
wills

I
know

where
my

are

If
Arthur

knew

My

tingle

mine
do

How
I

was
conscious

hand
on

started
awake
all
in
a
second
.

*NL*
*NL*
As
I
raised
the
blind
,
and
the
morning
sunlight
flooded
the
room
,
I
*NL*
heard
the
Professor
's
low
hiss
of
inspiration
,
and
knowing
its
rarity
,
a
*NL*
deadly
fear
shot
through
my
heart
.
As
I
passed
over
he
moved
back
,
and
*NL*
his
exclamation
of
horror
,
``
Gott
in
Himmel
!
''
needed
no
enforcement
from
*NL*
his
agonised
face
.
He
raised
his
hand
and
pointed
to
the
bed
,
and
his
*NL*
iron
face
was
drawn
and
ashen
white
.
I
felt
my
knees
begin
to
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
on
the
bed
,
seemingly
in
a
swoon
,
lay
poor
Lucy
,
more
horribly
*NL*
white
and
wan-looking
than
ever
.
Even
the
lips
were
white
,
and
the
gums
*NL*
seemed
to
have
shrunken
back
from
the
teeth
,
as
we
sometimes
see
in
a
*NL*
corpse
after
a
prolonged
illness
.
Van
Helsing
raised
his
foot
to
stamp
*NL*
in
anger
,
but
the
instinct
of
his
life
and
all
the
long
years
of
habit
*NL*
stood
to
him
,
and
he
put
it
down
again
softly
.
``
Quick
!
''
he
said
.
``
Bring
*NL*
the
brandy
.
''
I
flew
to
the
dining-room
,
and
returned
with
the
decanter
.
*NL*
He
wetted
the
poor
white
lips
with
it
,
and
together
we
rubbed
palm
and
*NL*
wrist
and
heart
.
He
felt
her
heart
,
and
after
a
few
moments
of
agonising
*NL*
suspense
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
too
late
.
It
beats
,
though
but
feebly
.
All
our
work
is
*NL*
undone
;
we
must
begin
again
.
There
is
no
young
Arthur
here
now
;
I
have
*NL*
to
call
on
you
yourself
this
time
,
friend
John
.
''
As
he
spoke
,
he
was
*NL*
dipping
into
his
bag
and
producing
the
instruments
for
transfusion
;
I
*NL*
had
taken
off
my
coat
and
rolled
up
my
shirt-sleeve
.
There
was
no
*NL*
possibility
of
an
opiate
just
at
present
,
and
no
need
of
one
;
and
so
,
*NL*
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
we
began
the
operation
.
After
a
time
--
it
did
*NL*
not
seem
a
short
time
either
,
for
the
draining
away
of
one
's
blood
,
no
*NL*
matter
how
willingly
it
be
given
,
is
a
terrible
feeling
--
Van
Helsing
*NL*
held
up
a
warning
finger
.
``
Do
not
stir
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
fear
that
with
*NL*
growing
strength
she
may
wake
;
and
that
would
make
danger
,
oh
,
so
much
*NL*
danger
.
But
I
shall
precaution
take
.
I
shall
give
hypodermic
injection
*NL*
of
morphia
.
''
He
proceeded
then
,
swiftly
and
deftly
,
to
carry
out
his
*NL*
intent
.
The
effect
on
Lucy
was
not
bad
,
for
the
faint
seemed
to
merge
*NL*
subtly
into
the
narcotic
sleep
.
It
was
with
a
feeling
of
personal
pride
*NL*
that
I
could
see
a
faint
tinge
of
colour
steal
back
into
the
pallid
*NL*
cheeks
and
lips
.
No
man
knows
,
till
he
experiences
it
,
what
it
is
to
*NL*
feel
his
own
life-blood
drawn
away
into
the
veins
of
the
woman
he
loves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Professor
watched
me
critically
.
``
That
will
do
,
''
he
said
.
``
Already
?
''
*NL*
I
remonstrated
.
``
You
took
a
great
deal
more
from
Art
.
''
To
which
he
*NL*
smiled
a
sad
sort
of
smile
as
he
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
her
lover
,
her
_
fiance
_
.
You
have
work
,
much
work
,
to
do
for
her
*NL*
and
for
others
;
and
the
present
will
suffice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
stopped
the
operation
,
he
attended
to
Lucy
,
whilst
I
applied
*NL*
digital
pressure
to
my
own
incision
.
I
laid
down
,
whilst
I
waited
his
*NL*
leisure
to
attend
to
me
,
for
I
felt
faint
and
a
little
sick
.
By-and-by
*NL*
he
bound
up
my
wound
,
and
sent
me
downstairs
to
get
a
glass
of
wine
for
*NL*
myself
.
As
I
was
leaving
the
room
,
he
came
after
me
,
and
half
*NL*
whispered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
nothing
must
be
said
of
this
.
If
our
young
lover
should
turn
up
*NL*
unexpected
,
as
before
,
no
word
to
him
.
It
would
at
once
frighten
him
and
*NL*
enjealous
him
,
too
.
There
must
be
none
.
So
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
back
he
looked
at
me
carefully
,
and
then
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
much
the
worse
.
Go
into
the
room
,
and
lie
on
your
sofa
,
and
*NL*
rest
awhile
;
then
have
much
breakfast
,
and
come
here
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
out
his
orders
,
for
I
knew
how
right
and
wise
they
were
.
I
*NL*
had
done
my
part
,
and
now
my
next
duty
was
to
keep
up
my
strength
.
I
*NL*
felt
very
weak
,
and
in
the
weakness
lost
something
of
the
amazement
at
*NL*
what
had
occurred
.
I
fell
asleep
on
the
sofa
,
however
,
wondering
over
*NL*
and
over
again
how
Lucy
had
made
such
a
retrograde
movement
,
and
how
*NL*
she
could
have
been
drained
of
so
much
blood
with
no
sign
anywhere
to
*NL*
show
for
it
.
I
think
I
must
have
continued
my
wonder
in
my
dreams
,
for
,
*NL*
sleeping
and
waking
,
my
thoughts
always
came
back
to
the
little
*NL*
punctures
in
her
throat
and
the
ragged
,
exhausted
appearance
of
their
*NL*
edges
--
tiny
though
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
slept
well
into
the
day
,
and
when
she
woke
she
was
fairly
well
and
*NL*
strong
,
though
not
nearly
so
much
so
as
the
day
before
.
When
Van
Helsing
*NL*
had
seen
her
,
he
went
out
for
a
walk
,
leaving
me
in
charge
,
with
strict
*NL*
injunctions
that
I
was
not
to
leave
her
for
a
moment
.
I
could
hear
his
*NL*
voice
in
the
hall
,
asking
the
way
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
chatted
with
me
freely
,
and
seemed
quite
unconscious
that
anything
*NL*
had
happened
.
I
tried
to
keep
her
amused
and
interested
.
When
her
mother
*NL*
came
up
to
see
her
,
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
any
change
whatever
,
but
*NL*
said
to
me
gratefully
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
owe
you
so
much
,
Dr.
Seward
,
for
all
you
have
done
,
but
you
really
*NL*
must
now
take
care
not
to
overwork
yourself
.
You
are
looking
pale
*NL*
yourself
.
You
want
a
wife
to
nurse
and
look
after
you
a
bit
;
that
you
*NL*
do
!
''
As
she
spoke
,
Lucy
turned
crimson
,
though
it
was
only
momentarily
,
*NL*
for
her
poor
wasted
veins
could
not
stand
for
long
such
an
unwonted
*NL*
drain
to
the
head
.
The
reaction
came
in
excessive
pallor
as
she
turned
*NL*
imploring
eyes
on
me
.
I
smiled
and
nodded
,
and
laid
my
finger
on
my
*NL*
lips
;
with
a
sigh
,
she
sank
back
amid
her
pillows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
returned
in
a
couple
of
hours
,
and
presently
said
to
me
:
*NL*
``
Now
you
go
home
,
and
eat
much
and
drink
enough
.
Make
yourself
strong
.
I
*NL*
stay
here
to-night
,
and
I
shall
sit
up
with
little
miss
myself
.
You
and
*NL*
I
must
watch
the
case
,
and
we
must
have
none
other
to
know
.
I
have
grave
*NL*
reasons
.
No
,
do
not
ask
them
;
think
what
you
will
.
Do
not
fear
to
think
*NL*
even
the
most
not-probable
.
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hall
two
of
the
maids
came
to
me
,
and
asked
if
they
or
either
of
*NL*
them
might
not
sit
up
with
Miss
Lucy
.
They
implored
me
to
let
them
;
and
*NL*
when
I
said
it
was
Dr.
Van
Helsing
's
wish
that
either
he
or
I
should
sit
*NL*
up
,
they
asked
me
quite
piteously
to
intercede
with
the
``
foreign
*NL*
gentleman
.
''
I
was
much
touched
by
their
kindness
.
Perhaps
it
is
because
*NL*
I
am
weak
at
present
,
and
perhaps
because
it
was
on
Lucy
's
account
,
that
*NL*
their
devotion
was
manifested
;
for
over
and
over
again
have
I
seen
*NL*
similar
instances
of
woman
's
kindness
.
I
got
back
here
in
time
for
a
*NL*
late
dinner
;
went
my
rounds
--
all
well
;
and
set
this
down
whilst
waiting
*NL*
for
sleep
.
It
is
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*

_
11
September
.
_
--
This
afternoon
I
went
over
to
Hillingham
.
Found
Van
*NL*
Helsing
in
excellent
spirits
,
and
Lucy
much
better
.
Shortly
after
I
had
*NL*
arrived
,
a
big
parcel
from
abroad
came
for
the
Professor
.
He
opened
it
*NL*
with
much
impressment
--
assumed
,
of
course
--
and
showed
a
great
bundle
of
*NL*
white
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
for
you
,
Miss
Lucy
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
?
Oh
,
Dr.
Van
Helsing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
but
not
for
you
to
play
with
.
These
are
medicines
.
''
Here
*NL*
Lucy
made
a
wry
face
.
``
Nay
,
but
they
are
not
to
take
in
a
decoction
or
*NL*
in
nauseous
form
,
so
you
need
not
snub
that
so
charming
nose
,
or
I
shall
*NL*
point
out
to
my
friend
Arthur
what
woes
he
may
have
to
endure
in
seeing
*NL*
so
much
beauty
that
he
so
loves
so
much
distort
.
Aha
,
my
pretty
miss
,
*NL*
that
bring
the
so
nice
nose
all
straight
again
.
This
is
medicinal
,
but
*NL*
you
do
not
know
how
.
I
put
him
in
your
window
,
I
make
pretty
wreath
,
and
*NL*
hang
him
round
your
neck
,
so
that
you
sleep
well
.
Oh
yes
!
they
,
like
the
*NL*
lotus
flower
,
make
your
trouble
forgotten
.
It
smell
so
like
the
waters
*NL*
of
Lethe
,
and
of
that
fountain
of
youth
that
the
Conquistadores
sought
*NL*
for
in
the
Floridas
,
and
find
him
all
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
he
was
speaking
,
Lucy
had
been
examining
the
flowers
and
smelling
*NL*
them
.
Now
she
threw
them
down
,
saying
,
with
half-laughter
,
and
*NL*
half-disgust
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Professor
,
I
believe
you
are
only
putting
up
a
joke
on
me
.
Why
,
*NL*
these
flowers
are
only
common
garlic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
my
surprise
,
Van
Helsing
rose
up
and
said
with
all
his
sternness
,
his
*NL*
iron
jaw
set
and
his
bushy
eyebrows
meeting
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
trifling
with
me
!
I
never
jest
!
There
is
grim
purpose
in
all
I
do
;
*NL*
and
I
warn
you
that
you
do
not
thwart
me
.
Take
care
,
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
others
if
not
for
your
own
.
''
Then
seeing
poor
Lucy
scared
,
as
she
might
*NL*
well
be
,
he
went
on
more
gently
:
``
Oh
,
little
miss
,
my
dear
,
do
not
fear
*NL*
me
.
I
only
do
for
your
good
;
but
there
is
much
virtue
to
you
in
those
so
*NL*
common
flowers
.
See
,
I
place
them
myself
in
your
room
.
I
make
myself
the
*NL*
wreath
that
you
are
to
wear
.
But
hush
!
no
telling
to
others
that
make
so
*NL*
inquisitive
questions
.
We
must
obey
,
and
silence
is
a
part
of
obedience
;
*NL*
and
obedience
is
to
bring
you
strong
and
well
into
loving
arms
that
wait
*NL*
for
you
.
Now
sit
still
awhile
.
Come
with
me
,
friend
John
,
and
you
shall
*NL*
help
me
deck
the
room
with
my
garlic
,
which
is
all
the
way
from
Haarlem
,
*NL*
where
my
friend
Vanderpool
raise
herb
in
his
glass-houses
all
the
year
.
*NL*
I
had
to
telegraph
yesterday
,
or
they
would
not
have
been
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
into
the
room
,
taking
the
flowers
with
us
.
The
Professor
's
*NL*
actions
were
certainly
odd
and
not
to
be
found
in
any
pharmacopoeia
*NL*
that
I
ever
heard
of
.
First
he
fastened
up
the
windows
and
latched
them
*NL*
securely
;
next
,
taking
a
handful
of
the
flowers
,
he
rubbed
them
all
over
*NL*
the
sashes
,
as
though
to
ensure
that
every
whiff
of
air
that
might
get
*NL*
in
would
be
laden
with
the
garlic
smell
.
Then
with
the
wisp
he
rubbed
*NL*
all
over
the
jamb
of
the
door
,
above
,
below
,
and
at
each
side
,
and
round
*NL*
the
fireplace
in
the
same
way
.
It
all
seemed
grotesque
to
me
,
and
*NL*
presently
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Professor
,
I
know
you
always
have
a
reason
for
what
you
do
,
but
*NL*
this
certainly
puzzles
me
.
It
is
well
we
have
no
sceptic
here
,
or
he
*NL*
would
say
that
you
were
working
some
spell
to
keep
out
an
evil
spirit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
am
!
''
he
answered
quietly
as
he
began
to
make
the
wreath
which
*NL*
Lucy
was
to
wear
round
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
then
waited
whilst
Lucy
made
her
toilet
for
the
night
,
and
when
she
*NL*
was
in
bed
he
came
and
himself
fixed
the
wreath
of
garlic
round
her
*NL*
neck
.
The
last
words
he
said
to
her
were
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
you
do
not
disturb
it
;
and
even
if
the
room
feel
close
,
do
*NL*
not
to-night
open
the
window
or
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
,
''
said
Lucy
,
``
and
thank
you
both
a
thousand
times
for
all
*NL*
your
kindness
to
me
!
Oh
,
what
have
I
done
to
be
blessed
with
such
*NL*
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
left
the
house
in
my
fly
,
which
was
waiting
,
Van
Helsing
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-night
I
can
sleep
in
peace
,
and
sleep
I
want
--
two
nights
of
travel
,
*NL*
much
reading
in
the
day
between
,
and
much
anxiety
on
the
day
to
follow
,
*NL*
and
a
night
to
sit
up
,
without
to
wink
.
To-morrow
in
the
morning
early
*NL*
you
call
for
me
,
and

felt

It

How
good
they
all
are
to
me
.
I
quite
love
that
dear
Dr.
*NL*
Van
Helsing
.
I
wonder
why
he
was
so
anxious
about
these
flowers
.
He
*NL*
positively
frightened
me
,
he
was
so
fierce
.
And
yet
he
must
have
been
*NL*
right
,
for
I
feel
comfort
from
them
already
.
Somehow
,
I
do
not
dread
*NL*
being
alone
to-night
,
and
I
can
go
to
sleep
without
fear
.
I
shall
not
*NL*
mind
any
flapping
outside
the
window
.
Oh
,
the
terrible
struggle
that
I
*NL*
have
had
against
sleep
so
often
of
late
;
the
pain
of
the
sleeplessness
,
*NL*
or
the
pain
of
the
fear
of
sleep
,
with
such
unknown
horrors
as
it
has
*NL*
for
me
!
How
blessed
are
some
people
,
whose
lives
have
no
fears
,
no
*NL*
dreads
;
to
whom
sleep
is
a
blessing
that
comes
nightly
,
and
brings
*NL*
nothing
but
sweet
dreams
.
Well
,
here
I
am
to-night
,
hoping
for
sleep
,
*NL*
and
lying
like
Ophelia
in
the
play
,
with
``
virgin
crants
and
maiden
*NL*
strewments
.
''
I
never
liked
garlic
before
,
but
to-night
it
is
delightful
!
*NL*
There
is
peace
in
its
smell
;
I
feel
sleep
coming
already
.
Good-night
,
*NL*
everybody
.

Called
at
the
Berkeley
and
found
Van
Helsing
,
as
usual
,
*NL*
up
to
time
.
The
carriage
ordered
from
the
hotel
was
waiting
.
The
*NL*
Professor
took
his
bag
,
which
he
always
brings
with
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
all
be
put
down
exactly
.
Van
Helsing
and
I
arrived
at
Hillingham
at
*NL*
eight
o'clock
.
It
was
a
lovely
morning
;
the
bright
sunshine
and
all
the
*NL*
fresh
feeling
of
early
autumn
seemed
like
the
completion
of
nature
's
*NL*
annual
work
.
The
leaves
were
turning
to
all
kinds
of
beautiful
colours
,
*NL*
but
had
not
yet
begun
to
drop
from
the
trees
.
When
we
entered
we
met
*NL*
Mrs.
Westenra
coming
out
of
the
morning
room
.
She
is
always
an
early
*NL*
riser
.
She
greeted
us
warmly
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
glad
to
know
that
Lucy
is
better
.
The
dear
child
is
still
*NL*
asleep
.
I
looked
into
her
room
and
saw
her
,
but
did
not
go
in
,
lest
I
*NL*
should
disturb
her
.
''
The
Professor
smiled
,
and
looked
quite
jubilant
.
He
*NL*
rubbed
his
hands
together
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
I
thought
I
had
diagnosed
the
case
.
My
treatment
is
working
,
''
to
*NL*
which
she
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
take
all
the
credit
to
yourself
,
doctor
.
Lucy
's
state
this
*NL*
morning
is
due
in
part
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
do
mean
,
ma'am
?
''
asked
the
Professor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
anxious
about
the
dear
child
in
the
night
,
and
went
into
*NL*
her
room
.
She
was
sleeping
soundly
--
so
soundly
that
even
my
coming
did
*NL*
not
wake
her
.
But
the
room
was
awfully
stuffy
.
There
were
a
lot
of
those
*NL*
horrible
,
strong-smelling
flowers
about
everywhere
,
and
she
had
actually
*NL*
a
bunch
of
them
round
her
neck
.
I
feared
that
the
heavy
odour
would
be
*NL*
too
much
for
the
dear
child
in
her
weak
state
,
so
I
took
them
all
away
*NL*
and
opened
a
bit
of
the
window
to
let
in
a
little
fresh
air
.
You
will
be
*NL*
pleased
with
her
,
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
off
into
her
boudoir
,
where
she
usually
breakfasted
early
.
As
*NL*
she
had
spoken
,
I
watched
the
Professor
's
face
,
and
saw
it
turn
ashen
*NL*
grey
.
He
had
been
able
to
retain
his
self-command
whilst
the
poor
lady
*NL*
was
present
,
for
he
knew
her
state
and
how
mischievous
a
shock
would
be
;
*NL*
he
actually
smiled
on
her
as
he
held
open
the
door
for
her
to
pass
into
*NL*
her
room
.
But
the
instant
she
had
disappeared
he
pulled
me
,
suddenly
and
*NL*
forcibly
,
into
the
dining-room
and
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
I
saw
Van
Helsing
break
down
.
He
*NL*
raised
his
hands
over
his
head
in
a
sort
of
mute
despair
,
and
then
beat
*NL*
his
palms
together
in
a
helpless
way
;
finally
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
,
*NL*
and
putting
his
hands
before
his
face
,
began
to
sob
,
with
loud
,
dry
sobs
*NL*
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
very
racking
of
his
heart
.
Then
he
raised
*NL*
his
arms
again
,
as
though
appealing
to
the
whole
universe
.
``
God
!
God
!
*NL*
God
!
''
he
said
.
``
What
have
we
done
,
what
has
this
poor
thing
done
,
that
*NL*
we
are
so
sore
beset
?
Is
there
fate
amongst
us
still
,
sent
down
from
the
*NL*
pagan
world
of
old
,
that
such
things
must
be
,
and
in
such
way
?
This
poor
*NL*
mother
,
all
unknowing
,
and
all
for
the
best
as
she
think
,
does
such
*NL*
thing
as
lose
her
daughter
body
and
soul
;
and
we
must
not
tell
her
,
we
*NL*
must
not
even
warn
her
,
or
she
die
,
and
then
both
die
.
Oh
,
how
we
are
*NL*
beset
!
How
are
all
the
powers
of
the
devils
against
us
!
''
Suddenly
he
*NL*
jumped
to
his
feet
.
``
Come
,
''
he
said
,
``
come
,
we
must
see
and
act
.
Devils
*NL*
or
no
devils
,
or
all
the
devils
at
once
,
it
matters
not
;
we
fight
him
*NL*
all
the
same
.
''
He
went
to
the
hall-door
for
his
bag
;
and
together
we
*NL*
went
up
to
Lucy
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
again
I
drew
up
the
blind
,
whilst
Van
Helsing
went
towards
the
bed
.
*NL*
This
time
he
did
not
start
as
he
looked
on
the
poor
face
with
the
same
*NL*
awful
,
waxen
pallor
as
before
.
He
wore
a
look
of
stern
sadness
and
*NL*
infinite
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
expected
,
''
he
murmured
,
with
that
hissing
inspiration
of
his
which
*NL*
meant
so
much
.
Without
a
word
he
went
and
locked
the
door
,
and
then
*NL*
began
to
set
out
on
the
little
table
the
instruments
for
yet
another
*NL*
operation
of
transfusion
of
blood
.
I
had
long
ago
recognised
the
*NL*
necessity
,
and
begun
to
take
off
my
coat
,
but
he
stopped
me
with
a
*NL*
warning
hand
.
``
No
!
''
he
said
.
``
To-day
you
must
operate
.
I
shall
provide
.
*NL*
You
are
weakened
already
.
''
As
he
spoke
he
took
off
his
coat
and
rolled
*NL*
up
his
shirt-sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
operation
;
again
the
narcotic
;
again
some
return
of
colour
to
*NL*
the
ashy
cheeks
,
and
the
regular
breathing
of
healthy
sleep
.
This
time
I
*NL*
watched
whilst
Van
Helsing
recruited
himself
and
rested
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
he
took
an
opportunity
of
telling
Mrs.
Westenra
that
she
must
*NL*
not
remove
anything
from
Lucy
's
room
without
consulting
him
;
that
the
*NL*
flowers
were
of
medicinal
value
,
and
that
the
breathing
of
their
odour
*NL*
was
a
part
of
the
system
of
cure
.
Then
he
took
over
the
care
of
the
case
*NL*
himself
,
saying
that
he
would
watch
this
night
and
the
next
and
would
*NL*
send
me
word
when
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
another
hour
Lucy
waked
from
her
sleep
,
fresh
and
bright
and
*NL*
seemingly
not
much
the
worse
for
her
terrible
ordeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
does
it
all
mean
?
I
am
beginning
to
wonder
if
my
long
habit
of
life
*NL*
amongst
the
insane
is
beginning
to
tell
upon
my
own
brain
.

--
Four
days
and
nights
of
peace
.
I
am
getting
so
strong
*NL*
again
that
I
hardly
know
myself
.
It
is
as
if
I
had
passed
through
some
*NL*
long
nightmare
,
and
had
just
awakened
to
see
the
beautiful
sunshine
and
*NL*
feel
the
fresh
air
of
the
morning
around
me
.
I
have
a
dim
*NL*
half-remembrance
of
long
,
anxious
times
of
waiting
and
fearing
;
darkness
*NL*
in
which
there
was
not
even
the
pain
of
hope
to
make
present
distress
*NL*
more
poignant
:
and
then
long
spells
of
oblivion
,
and
the
rising
back
to
*NL*
life
as
a
diver
coming
up
through
a
great
press
of
water
.
Since
,
*NL*
however
,
Dr.
Van
Helsing
has
been
with
me
,
all
this
bad
dreaming
seems
*NL*
to
have
passed
away
;
the
noises
that
used
to
frighten
me
out
of
my
*NL*
wits
--
the
flapping
against
the
windows
,
the
distant
voices
which
seemed
*NL*
so
close
to
me
,
the
harsh
sounds
that
came
from
I
know
not
where
and
*NL*
commanded
me
to
do
I
know
not
what
--
have
all
ceased
.
I
go
to
bed
now
*NL*
without
any
fear
of
sleep
.
I
do
not
even
try
to
keep
awake
.
I
have
grown
*NL*
quite
fond
of
the
garlic
,
and
a
boxful
arrives
for
me
every
day
from
*NL*
Haarlem
.
To-night
Dr.
Van
Helsing
is
going
away
,
as
he
has
to
be
for
a
*NL*
day
in
Amsterdam
.
But
I
need
not
be
watched
;
I
am
well
enough
to
be
left
*NL*
alone
.
Thank
God
for
mother
's
sake
,
and
dear
Arthur
's
,
and
for
all
our
*NL*
friends
who
have
been
so
kind
!
I
shall
not
even
feel
the
change
,
for
*NL*
last
night
Dr.
Van
Helsing
slept
in
his
chair
a
lot
of
the
time
.
I
found
*NL*
him
asleep
twice
when
I
awoke
;
but
I
did
not
fear
to
go
to
sleep
again
,
*NL*
although
the
boughs
or
bats
or
something
napped
almost
angrily
against
*NL*
the
window-panes

After
many
inquiries
and
almost
as
many
refusals
,
and
perpetually
using
*NL*
the
words
``
Pall
Mall
Gazette
''
as
a
sort
of
talisman
,
I
managed
to
find
*NL*
the
keeper
of
the
section
of
the
Zooelogical
Gardens
in
which
the
wolf
*NL*
department
is
included
.
Thomas
Bilder
lives
in
one
of
the
cottages
in
*NL*
the
enclosure
behind
the
elephant-house
,
and
was
just
sitting
down
to
*NL*
his
tea
when
I
found
him
.
Thomas
and
his
wife
are
hospitable
folk
,
*NL*
elderly
,
and
without
children
,
and
if
the
specimen
I
enjoyed
of
their
*NL*
hospitality
be
of
the
average
kind
,
their
lives
must
be
pretty
*NL*
comfortable
.
The
keeper
would
not
enter
on
what
he
called
``
business
''
*NL*
until
the
supper
was
over
,
and
we
were
all
satisfied
.
Then
when
the
*NL*
table
was
cleared
,
and
he
had
lit
his
pipe
,
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sir
,
you
can
go
on
and
arsk
me
what
you
want

You
'll
excoose
me

to

of

I
gives
the

wolves
and
the
jackals

in

their

afore
*NL*
I

them

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean

ask
them

I
queried
,
wishful
to
get
him
*NL*
into
a
talkative
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Ittin
'
of
them
over
the
`

scratchin

is
another
,
when

to
speak

he
added
philosophically
,
``

This

about

That
`
ere
wolf
*NL*
what
we
called
Bersicker
was
one
of
three
grey
ones
that
came
from
*NL*
Norway
to
Jamrach
's
,
which
we
bought
off
him
four
years
ago
.
He
was
a
*NL*
nice
well-behaved
wolf
,
that
never
gave
no
trouble
to
talk
of
.
I
'm
more
*NL*
surprised
at
`
im
for
wantin
'
to
get
out
nor
any
other
animile
in
the
*NL*
place

But
,
there
,
you

n't
trust
wolves
no
more
nor
women

long
that

there

no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
it
was
about
two
hours
after
feedin
'
yesterday
when
I
first
*NL*
hear
my
disturbance
.
I
was
makin
'
up
a
litter
in
the
monkey-house
for
a
*NL*
young
puma
which
is
ill
;
but
when
I
heard
the
yelpin
'
and
`
owlin
'
I
kem
*NL*
away
straight
.
There
was
Bersicker
a-tearin
'
like
a
mad
thing
at
the
*NL*
bars
as
if
he
wanted
to
get
out
.
There
was
n't
much
people
about
that
*NL*
day
,
and
close
at
hand
was
only
one
man
,
a
tall
,
thin
chap
,
with
a
`
ook
*NL*
nose
and
a
pointed
beard
,
with
a
few
white
hairs
runnin
'
through
it
.
He
*NL*
had
a
`
ard
,
cold
look
and
red
eyes
,
and
I
took
a
sort
of
mislike
to
him
,
*NL*
for
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
`
im
as
they
was
hirritated
at
.
He
`
ad
white
*NL*
kid
gloves
on
`
is
`
ands
,
and
he
pointed
out
the
animiles
to
me
and
says
:
*NL*
`
Keeper
,
these
wolves
seem
upset
at
something
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Maybe
it
's
you
,
'
says
I
,
for
I
did
not
like
the
airs
as
he
give
*NL*
`
isself
.
He
did
n't
git
angry
,
as
I
`
oped
he
would
,
but
he
smiled
a
kind
*NL*
of
insolent
smile
,
with
a
mouth
full
of
white
,
sharp
teeth
.
`
Oh
no
,
they
*NL*
would
n't
like
me

Ow
yes

they

`
They
always

a

bone

two
to
clean
their
teeth
on
about
tea-time

you
`

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

it
was
a
odd

when

they
*NL*
lay
down
,
and
when
I
went
over
to
Bersicker
he
let
me
stroke
his
ears
*NL*

as
ever

That
there
man
kem
over
,
and
blessed
but
if
he
did

put
*NL*
in
his

stroke

Are

*NL*
''
`
No

he
,
`
not
exactly
in

I
`
ave
made
pets

several

And
with
that
he
lifts
his
`
at
as
perlite
as

walks
*NL*
away

Old
Bersicker
kep
'
a-lookin
'
arter
`
im
till
'
e
was
out
of
sight
,
*NL*
and
then
went
and
lay
down
in
a
corner
and
would
n't
come
hout
the
`
ole
*NL*
hevening
.
Well
,
larst
night
,
so
soon
as
the
moon
was
hup
,
the
wolves
*NL*
here
all
began
a

There
war
n't
nothing

at

There
war
n't
no

that
was
evidently
a-callin

a
*NL*
dog
somewheres
out
back
of
the
gardings
in
the
Park
road
.
Once
or
twice
*NL*
I
went
out
to
see
that
all
was
right
,
and
it
was
,
and
then
the
`
owling
*NL*
stopped
.
Just
before
twelve
o'clock
I
just
took
a
look
round
afore
*NL*
turnin
'
in

an
'

bust
me

but
when
I
kem
opposite
to
old
Bersicker
's
*NL*
cage
I
see
the
rails
broken
and
twisted
about
and
the
cage
empty
.
And
*NL*
that
's
all
I
know
for
certing

*NL*
``
Did

when

a

At

never

up

night-a-huntin

Now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

he
said
,
with

*NL*
``
Well
then

I
accounts

it
seems
to
me
that
`

escaped

simply
because
he
wanted

*NL*
*NL*
From
the
hearty

that
both
Thomas

laughed
at

I
*NL*
could
see
that
it
had
done
service
before

that
the
whole

explanation
was
simply
an
elaborate

I
could

cope
in
badinage

with
the
worthy
Thomas

I
thought
I
knew
a
surer
way

I
said
:

*NL*
``
Now

*NL*
``
Well

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
opinion

this

that

is
a

somewheres

The

gard

he
was
a-gallopin

faster

than
a

I
do
n't
believe
him
,
for

yer

*NL*
wolves
do
n't
gallop
no
more
nor
dogs
does
,

way

Wolves
is
fine

dessay
when

in

does

they
is

whatever
it
is

But
,
*NL*
Lor

bless
you
,
in
real
life
a

is
only
a
low
creature

not
half
so
*NL*
clever

bold
as
a
good
dog

and
not
half
a
quarter
so
much
fight
in
*NL*

This
one
ai
n't
been
used
to
fightin

even
to
providin

hisself

more
like
he
's
somewhere
round
the
Park
a

`
idin
'
an

*NL*
a-shiverin

,
if
he

If

he

bound
to
look
for

mayhap
he
may
chance
to
light
on
a
butcher

shop
in

If

well

then
I
*NL*
should
n't
be
surprised

the

is
one
babby

That
's
*NL*
all

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
handing
him
the
half-sovereign
,
when
something
came
bobbing
up
*NL*
against
the
window
,
and
Mr.
Bilder
's
face
doubled
its
natural
length
*NL*
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless

said

``
If

*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
;
a
most
unnecessary
proceeding
it
*NL*
seemed
to
me
.
I
have
always
thought
that
a
wild
animal
never
looks
so
*NL*
well
as
when
some
obstacle
of
pronounced
durability
is
between
us
;
a
*NL*
personal
experience
has
intensified
rather
than
diminished
that
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
however
,
there
is
nothing
like
custom
,
for
neither
Bilder
nor
*NL*
his
wife
thought
any
more
of
the
wolf
than
I
should
of
a
dog
.
The
animal
*NL*
itself
was
as
peaceful
and
well-behaved
as
that
father
of
all
*NL*
picture-wolves
--
Red
Riding
Hood
's
quondam
friend
,
whilst
moving
her
*NL*
confidence
in
masquerade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
scene
was
an
unutterable
mixture
of
comedy
and
pathos
.
The
*NL*
wicked
wolf
that
for
half
a
day
had
paralysed
London
and
set
all
the
*NL*
children
in
the
town
shivering
in
their
shoes
,
was
there
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
penitent
mood
,
and
was
received
and
petted
like
a
sort
of
vulpine
*NL*
prodigal
son
.
Old
Bilder
examined
him
all
over
with
most
tender
*NL*
solicitude
,
and
when
he
had
finished
with
his
penitent
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
I
knew
the
poor
old

would
get

kind

trouble

it
all

He
took
the
wolf
and
locked
him
up
in
a
cage
,
with
a
piece
of
meat
that
*NL*
satisfied
,
in
quantity
at
any
rate

the
elementary
conditions
of
the
*NL*
fatted

went
off

17
September

--
I
was
engaged
after
dinner
in
my
study
posting
up
my
*NL*
books
,
which
,
through
press
of
other
work
and
the
many
visits
to
Lucy
,
*NL*
had
fallen
sadly
into
arrear
.
Suddenly
the
door
was
burst
open
,
and
in
*NL*
rushed
my
patient
,
with
his
face
distorted
with
passion
.
I
was
*NL*
thunderstruck
,
for
such
a
thing
as
a
patient
getting
of
his
own
accord
*NL*
into
the
Superintendent
's
study
is
almost
unknown
.
Without
an
instant
's
*NL*
pause
he
made
straight
at
me
.
He
had
a
dinner-knife
in
his
hand
,
and
,
*NL*
as
I
saw
he
was
dangerous
,
I
tried
to
keep
the
table
between
us
.
He
was
*NL*
too
quick
and
too
strong
for
me
,
however
;
for
before
I
could
get
my
*NL*
balance
he
had
struck
at
me
and
cut
my
left
wrist
rather
severely
.
*NL*
Before
he
could
strike
again
,
however
,
I
got
in
my
right
and
he
was
*NL*
sprawling
on
his
back
on
the
floor
.
My
wrist
bled
freely
,
and
quite
a
*NL*
little
pool
trickled
on
to
the
carpet
.
I
saw
that
my
friend
was
not
*NL*
intent
on
further
effort
,
and
occupied
myself
binding
up
my
wrist
,
*NL*
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
the
prostrate
figure
all
the
time
.
When
the
*NL*
attendants
rushed
in
,
and
we
turned
our
attention
to
him
,
his
employment
*NL*
positively
sickened
me
.
He
was
lying
on
his
belly
on
the
floor
licking
*NL*
up
,
like
a
dog
,
the
blood
which
had
fallen
from
my
wounded
wrist
.
He
was
*NL*

to

with

again
:

*NL*
I
can
not

at

I

lost

much

late
for
my

,
and
then
the
prolonged
strain
of
Lucy
's
*NL*
illness
and
its
horrible
phases
is
telling
on
me
.
I
am
over-excited
and
*NL*
weary
,
and
I
need
rest
,
rest
,
rest

Happily
Van
Helsing
has
not

I
need
not
forego
my
sleep

to-night
I
could

well

Just
off
for
train
to
London
.
The
arrival
of
Van
*NL*
Helsing
's
telegram
filled
me
with
dismay
.
A
whole
night
lost
,
and
I
know
*NL*
by
bitter
experience
what
may
happen
in
a
night
.
Of
course
it
is
*NL*
possible
that
all
may
be
well
,
but
what
_
may
_
have
happened
?
Surely
*NL*
there
is
some
horrible
doom
hanging
over
us
that
every
possible
accident
*NL*
should
thwart
us
in
all
we
try
to
do
.
I
shall
take
this
cylinder
with
*NL*

and
then
I
can
complete
my
entry

17
September
.
Night
.
_
--
I
write
this
and
leave
it
to
be
seen
,
so
that
no
*NL*
one
may
by
any
chance
get
into
trouble
through
me
.
This
is
an
exact
*NL*
record
of
what
took
place
to-night
.
I
feel
I
am
dying
of
weakness
,
and
*NL*
have
barely
strength
to
write
,
but
it
must
be
done
if
I
die
in
the
*NL*
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
bed
as
usual
,
taking
care
that
the
flowers
were
placed
as
Dr.
*NL*
Van
Helsing
directed
,
and
soon
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
waked
by
the
flapping
at
the
window
,
which
had
begun
after
that
*NL*
sleep-walking
on
the
cliff
at
Whitby
when
Mina
saved
me
,
and
which
now
I
*NL*
know
so
well
.
I
was
not
afraid
,
but
I
did
wish
that
Dr.
Seward
was
in
*NL*
the
next
room
--
as
Dr.
Van
Helsing
said
he
would
be
--
so
that
I
might
have
*NL*
called
him
.
I
tried
to
go
to
sleep
,
but
could
not
.
Then
there
came
to
me
*NL*
the
old
fear
of
sleep
,
and
I
determined
to
keep
awake
.
Perversely
sleep
*NL*
would
try
to
come
then
when
I
did
not
want
it
;
so
,
as
I
feared
to
be
*NL*
alone
,
I
opened
my
door
and
called
out
:
``
Is
there
anybody
there
?
''
There
*NL*
was
no
answer
.
I
was
afraid
to
wake
mother
,
and
so
closed
my
door
again
.
*NL*
Then
outside
in
the
shrubbery
I
heard
a
sort
of
howl
like
a
dog
's
,
but
*NL*
more
fierce
and
deeper
.
I
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
,
but
could
*NL*
see
nothing
,
except
a
big
bat
,
which
had
evidently
been
buffeting
its
*NL*
wings
against
the
window
.
So
I
went
back
to
bed
again
,
but
determined
*NL*
not
to
go
to
sleep
.
Presently
the
door
opened
,
and
mother
looked
in
;
*NL*
seeing
by
my
moving
that
I
was
not
asleep
,
came
in
,
and
sat
by
me
.
She
*NL*
said
to
me
even
more
sweetly
and
softly
than
her
wont
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
uneasy
about
you
,
darling
,
and
came
in
to
see
that
you
were
all
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
feared
she
might
catch
cold
sitting
there
,
and
asked
her
to
come
in
*NL*
and
sleep
with
me
,
so
she
came
into
bed
,
and
lay
down
beside
me
;
she
did
*NL*
not
take
off
her
dressing
gown
,
for
she
said
she
would
only
stay
a
while
*NL*
and
then
go
back
to
her
own
bed
.
As
she
lay
there
in
my
arms
,
and
I
in
*NL*
hers
,
the
flapping
and
buffeting
came
to
the
window
again
.
She
was
*NL*
startled
and
a
little
frightened
,
and
cried
out
:
``
What
is
that
?
''
I
tried
*NL*
to
pacify
her
,
and
at
last
succeeded
,
and
she
lay
quiet
;
but
I
could
*NL*
hear
her
poor
dear
heart
still
beating
terribly
.
After
a
while
there
was
*NL*
the
low
howl
again
out
in
the
shrubbery
,
and
shortly
after
there
was
a
*NL*
crash
at
the
window
,
and
a
lot
of
broken
glass
was
hurled
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
The
window
blind
blew
back
with
the
wind
that
rushed
in
,
and
in
the
*NL*
aperture
of
the
broken
panes
there
was
the
head
of
a
great
,
gaunt
grey
*NL*
wolf
.
Mother
cried
out
in
a
fright
,
and
struggled
up
into
a
sitting
*NL*
posture
,
and
clutched
wildly
at
anything
that
would
help
her
.
Amongst
*NL*
other
things
,
she
clutched
the
wreath
of
flowers
that
Dr.
Van
Helsing
*NL*
insisted
on
my
wearing
round
my
neck
,
and
tore
it
away
from
me
.
For
a
*NL*
second
or
two
she
sat
up
,
pointing
at
the
wolf
,
and
there
was
a
strange
*NL*
and
horrible
gurgling
in
her
throat
;
then
she
fell
over
--
as
if
struck
*NL*
with
lightning
,
and
her
head
hit
my
forehead
and
made
me
dizzy
for
a
*NL*
moment
or
two
.
The
room
and
all
round
seemed
to
spin
round
.
I
kept
my
*NL*
eyes
fixed
on
the
window
,
but
the
wolf
drew
his
head
back
,
and
a
whole
*NL*
myriad
of
little
specks
seemed
to
come
blowing
in
through
the
broken
*NL*
window
,
and
wheeling
and
circling
round
like
the
pillar
of
dust
that
*NL*
travellers
describe
when
there
is
a
simoon
in
the
desert
.
I
tried
to
*NL*
stir
,
but
there
was
some
spell
upon
me
,
and
dear
mother
's
poor
body
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
grow
cold
already
--
for
her
dear
heart
had
ceased
to
*NL*
beat
--
weighed
me
down
;
and
I
remembered
no
more
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
did
not
seem
long
,
but
very
,
very
awful
,
till
I
recovered
*NL*
consciousness
again
.
Somewhere
near
,
a
passing
bell
was
tolling
;
the
*NL*
dogs
all
round
the
neighbourhood
were
howling
;
and
in
our
shrubbery
,
*NL*
seemingly
just
outside
,
a
nightingale
was
singing
.
I
was
dazed
and
*NL*
stupid
with
pain
and
terror
and
weakness
,
but
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
nightingale
seemed
like
the
voice
of
my
dead
mother
come
back
to
comfort
*NL*
me
.
The
sounds
seemed
to
have
awakened
the
maids
,
too
,
for
I
could
hear
*NL*
their
bare
feet
pattering
outside
my
door
.
I
called
to
them
,
and
they
*NL*
came
in
,
and
when
they
saw
what
had
happened
,
and
what
it
was
that
lay
*NL*
over
me
on
the
bed
,
they
screamed
out
.
The
wind
rushed
in
through
the
*NL*
broken
window
,
and
the
door
slammed
to
.
They
lifted
off
the
body
of
my
*NL*
dear
mother
,
and
laid
her
,
covered
up
with
a
sheet
,
on
the
bed
after
I
*NL*
had
got
up
.
They
were
all
so
frightened
and
nervous
that
I
directed
them
*NL*
to
go
to
the
dining-room
and
have
each
a
glass
of
wine
.
The
door
flew
*NL*
open
for
an
instant
and
closed
again
.
The
maids
shrieked
,
and
then
went
*NL*
in
a
body
to
the
dining-room
;
and
I
laid
what
flowers
I
had
on
my
dear
*NL*
mother
's
breast
.
When
they
were
there
I
remembered
what
Dr.
Van
Helsing
*NL*
had
told
me
,
but
I
did
n't
like
to
remove
them
,
and
,
besides
,
I
would
*NL*
have
some
of
the
servants
to
sit
up
with
me
now
.
I
was
surprised
that
*NL*
the
maids
did
not
come
back
.
I
called
them
,
but
got
no
answer
,
so
I
went
*NL*
to
the
dining-room
to
look
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
sank
when
I
saw
what
had
happened
.
They
all
four
lay
helpless
*NL*
on
the
floor
,
breathing
heavily
.
The
decanter
of
sherry
was
on
the
table
*NL*
half
full
,
but
there
was
a
queer
,
acrid
smell
about
.
I
was
suspicious
,
*NL*
and
examined
the
decanter
.
It
smelt
of
laudanum
,
and
looking
on
the
*NL*
sideboard
,
I
found
that
the
bottle
which
mother
's
doctor
uses
for
*NL*
her
--
oh
!
did
use
--
was
empty
.
What
am
I
to
do
?
what
am
I
to
do
?
I
am
back
*NL*
in
the
room
with
mother
.
I
can
not
leave
her
,
and
I
am
alone
,
save
for
*NL*
the
sleeping
servants
,
whom
some
one
has
drugged
.
Alone
with
the
dead
!
I
*NL*
dare
not
go
out
,
for
I
can
hear
the
low
howl
of
the
wolf
through
the
*NL*
broken
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
seems
full
of
specks
,
floating
and
circling
in
the
draught
from
*NL*
the
window
,
and
the
lights
burn
blue
and
dim
.
What
am
I
to
do
?
God
*NL*
shield
me
from
harm
this
night
!
I
shall
hide
this
paper
in
my
breast
,
*NL*
where
they
shall
find
it
when
they
come
to
lay
me
out
.
My
dear
mother
*NL*
gone
!
It
is
time
that
I
go
too
.
Good-bye
,
dear
Arthur
,
if
I
should
not
*NL*
survive
this
night
.
God
keep
you
,
dear
,
and
God
help
me
!

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
DR.
SEWARD
'S
DIARY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
18
September
.
_
--
I
drove
at
once
to
Hillingham
and
arrived
early
.
*NL*
Keeping
my
cab
at
the
gate
,
I
went
up
the
avenue
alone
.
I
knocked
gently
*NL*
and
rang
as
quietly
as
possible
,
for
I
feared
to
disturb
Lucy
or
her
*NL*
mother
,
and
hoped
to
only
bring
a
servant
to
the
door
.
After
a
while
,
*NL*
finding
no
response
,
I
knocked
and
rang
again
;
still
no
answer
.
I
cursed
*NL*
the
laziness
of
the
servants
that
they
should
lie
abed
at
such
an
*NL*
hour
--
for
it
was
now
ten
o'clock
--
and
so
rang
and
knocked
again
,
but
*NL*
more
impatiently
,
but
still
without
response
.
Hitherto
I
had
blamed
only
*NL*
the
servants
,
but
now
a
terrible
fear
began
to
assail
me
.
Was
this
*NL*
desolation
but
another
link
in
the
chain
of
doom
which
seemed
drawing
*NL*
tight
around
us
?
Was
it
indeed
a
house
of
death
to
which
I
had
come
,
too
*NL*
late
?
I
knew
that
minutes
,
even
seconds
of
delay
,
might
mean
hours
of
*NL*
danger
to
Lucy
,
if
she
had
had
again
one
of
those
frightful
relapses
;
*NL*
and
I
went
round
the
house
to
try
if
I
could
find
by
chance
an
entry
*NL*
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
find
no
means
of
ingress
.
Every
window
and
door
was
fastened
and
*NL*
locked
,
and
I
returned
baffled
to
the
porch
.
As
I
did
so
,
I
heard
the
*NL*
rapid
pit-pat
of
a
swiftly
driven
horse
's
feet
.
They
stopped
at
the
*NL*
gate
,
and
a
few
seconds
later
I
met
Van
Helsing
running
up
the
avenue
.
*NL*
When
he
saw
me
,
he
gasped
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
was
you
,
and
just
arrived
.
How
is
she
?
Are
we
too
late
?
Did
you
*NL*
not
get
my
telegram
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
as
quickly
and
coherently
as
I
could
that
I
had
only
got
his
*NL*
telegram
early
in
the
morning
,
and
had
not
lost
a
minute
in
coming
here
,
*NL*
and
that
I
could
not
make
any
one
in
the
house
hear
me
.
He
paused
and
*NL*
raised
his
hat
as
he
said
solemnly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
fear
we
are
too
late
.
God
's
will
be
done
!
''
With
his
usual
*NL*
recuperative
energy
,
he
went
on
:
``
Come
.
If
there
be
no
way
open
to
get
*NL*
in
,
we
must
make
one
.
Time
is
all
in
all
to
us
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
,
where
there
was
a
kitchen
*NL*
window
.
The
Professor
took
a
small
surgical
saw
from
his
case
,
and
*NL*
handing
it
to
me
,
pointed
to
the
iron
bars
which
guarded
the
window
.
I
*NL*
attacked
them
at
once
and
had
very
soon
cut
through
three
of
them
.
Then
*NL*
with
a
long
,
thin
knife
we
pushed
back
the
fastening
of
the
sashes
and
*NL*
opened
the
window
.
I
helped
the
Professor
in
,
and
followed
him
.
There
*NL*
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
or
in
the
servants
'
rooms
,
which
were
close
at
*NL*
hand
.
We
tried
all
the
rooms
as
we
went
along
,
and
in
the
dining-room
,
*NL*
dimly
lit
by
rays
of
light
through
the
shutters
,
found
four
*NL*
servant-women
lying
on
the
floor
.
There
was
no
need
to
think
them
dead
,
*NL*
for
their
stertorous
breathing
and
the
acrid
smell
of
laudanum
in
the
*NL*
room
left
no
doubt
as
to
their
condition
.
Van
Helsing
and
I
looked
at
*NL*
each
other
,
and
as
we
moved
away
he
said
:
``
We
can
attend
to
them
later
.
''
*NL*
Then
we
ascended
to
Lucy
's
room
.
For
an
instant
or
two
we
paused
at
the
*NL*
door
to
listen
,
but
there
was
no
sound
that
we
could
hear
.
With
white
*NL*
faces
and
trembling
hands
,
we
opened
the
door
gently
,
and
entered
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
shall
I
describe
what
we
saw
?
On
the
bed
lay
two
women
,
Lucy
and
her
*NL*
mother
.
The
latter
lay
farthest
in
,
and
she
was
covered
with
a
white
*NL*
sheet
,
the
edge
of
which
had
been
blown
back
by
the
draught
through
the
*NL*
broken
window
,
showing
the
drawn
,
white
face
,
with
a
look
of
terror
*NL*
fixed
upon
it
.
By
her
side
lay
Lucy
,
with
face
white
and
still
more
*NL*
drawn
.
The
flowers
which
had
been
round
her
neck
we
found
upon
her
*NL*
mother
's
bosom
,
and
her
throat
was
bare
,
showing
the
two
little
wounds
*NL*
which
we
had
noticed
before
,
but
looking
horribly
white
and
mangled
.
*NL*
Without
a
word
the
Professor
bent
over
the
bed
,
his
head
almost
touching
*NL*
poor
Lucy
's
breast
;
then
he
gave
a
quick
turn
of
his
head
,
as
of
one
who
*NL*
listens
,
and
leaping
to
his
feet
,
he
cried
out
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
yet
too
late
!
Quick
!
quick
!
Bring
the
brandy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
flew
downstairs
and
returned
with
it
,
taking
care
to
smell
and
taste
*NL*
it
,
lest
it
,
too
,
were
drugged
like
the
decanter
of
sherry
which
I
found
*NL*
on
the
table
.
The
maids
were
still
breathing
,
but
more
restlessly
,
and
I
*NL*
fancied
that
the
narcotic
was
wearing
off
.
I
did
not
stay
to
make
sure
,
*NL*
but
returned
to
Van
Helsing
.
He
rubbed
the
brandy
,
as
on
another
*NL*
occasion
,
on
her
lips
and
gums
and
on
her
wrists
and
the
palms
of
her
*NL*
hands
.
He
said
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
do
this
,
all
that
can
be
at
the
present
.
You
go
wake
those
maids
.
*NL*
Flick
them
in
the
face
with
a
wet
towel
,
and
flick
them
hard
.
Make
them
*NL*
get
heat
and
fire
and
a
warm
bath
.
This
poor
soul
is
nearly
as
cold
as
*NL*
that
beside
her
.
She
will
need
be
heated
before
we
can
do
anything
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
at
once
,
and
found
little
difficulty
in
waking
three
of
the
*NL*
women
.
The
fourth
was
only
a
young
girl
,
and
the
drug
had
evidently
*NL*
affected
her
more
strongly
,
so
I
lifted
her
on
the
sofa
and
let
her
*NL*
sleep
.
The
others
were
dazed
at
first
,
but
as
remembrance
came
back
to
*NL*
them
they
cried
and
sobbed
in
a
hysterical
manner
.
I
was
stern
with
*NL*
them
,
however
,
and
would
not
let
them
talk
.
I
told
them
that
one
life
*NL*
was
bad
enough
to
lose
,
and
that
if
they
delayed
they
would
sacrifice
*NL*
Miss
Lucy
.
So
,
sobbing
and
crying
,
they
went
about
their
way
,
half
clad
*NL*
as
they
were
,
and
prepared
fire
and
water
.
Fortunately
,
the
kitchen
and
*NL*
boiler
fires
were
still
alive
,
and
there
was
no
lack
of
hot
water
.
We
*NL*
got
a
bath
and
carried
Lucy
out
as
she
was
and
placed
her
in
it
.
Whilst
*NL*
we
were
busy
chafing
her
limbs
there
was
a
knock
at
the
hall
door
.
One
*NL*
of
the
maids
ran
off
,
hurried
on
some
more
clothes
,
and
opened
it
.
Then
*NL*
she
returned
and
whispered
to
us
that
there
was
a
gentleman
who
had
come
*NL*
with
a
message
from
Mr.
Holmwood
.
I
bade
her
simply
tell
him
that
he
*NL*
must
wait
,
for
we
could
see
no
one
now
.
She
went
away
with
the
message
,
*NL*
and
,
engrossed
with
our
work
,
I
clean
forgot
all
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
saw
in
all
my
experience
the
Professor
work
in
such
deadly
*NL*
earnest
.
I
knew
--
as
he
knew
--
that
it
was
a
stand-up
fight
with
death
,
*NL*
and
in
a
pause
told
him
so
.
He
answered
me
in
a
way
that
I
did
not
*NL*
understand
,
but
with
the
sternest
look
that
his
face
could
wear
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
were
all
,
I
would
stop
here
where
we
are
now
,
and
let
her
fade
*NL*
away
into
peace
,
for
I
see
no
light
in
life
over
her
horizon
.
''
He
went
*NL*
on
with
his
work
with
,
if
possible
,
renewed
and
more
frenzied
vigour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
we
both
began
to
be
conscious
that
the
heat
was
beginning
to
*NL*
be
of
some
effect
.
Lucy
's
heart
beat
a
trifle
more
audibly
to
the
*NL*
stethoscope
,
and
her
lungs
had
a
perceptible
movement
.
Van
Helsing
's
*NL*
face
almost
beamed
,
and
as
we
lifted
her
from
the
bath
and
rolled
her
in
*NL*
a
hot
sheet
to
dry
her
he
said
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
gain
is
ours
!
Check
to
the
King
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
took
Lucy
into
another
room
,
which
had
by
now
been
prepared
,
and
laid
*NL*
her
in
bed
and
forced
a
few
drops
of
brandy
down
her
throat
.
I
noticed
*NL*
that
Van
Helsing
tied
a
soft
silk
handkerchief
round
her
throat
.
She
was
*NL*
still
unconscious
,
and
was
quite
as
bad
as
,
if
not
worse
than
,
we
had
*NL*
ever
seen
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
called
in
one
of
the
women
,
and
told
her
to
stay
with
her
*NL*
and
not
to
take
her
eyes
off
her
till
we
returned
,
and
then
beckoned
me
*NL*
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
consult
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
,
''
he
said
as
we
descended
the
*NL*
stairs
.
In
the
hall
he
opened
the
dining-room
door
,
and
we
passed
in
,
he
*NL*
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
.
The
shutters
had
been
opened
,
but
*NL*
the
blinds
were
already
down
,
with
that
obedience
to
the
etiquette
of
*NL*
death
which
the
British
woman
of
the
lower
classes
always
rigidly
*NL*
observes
.
The
room
was
,
therefore
,
dimly
dark
.
It
was
,
however
,
light
*NL*
enough
for
our
purposes
.
Van
Helsing
's
sternness
was
somewhat
relieved
*NL*
by
a
look
of
perplexity
.
He
was
evidently
torturing
his
mind
about
*NL*
something
,
so
I
waited
for
an
instant
,
and
he
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
to
do
now
?
Where
are
we
to
turn
for
help
?
We
must
have
*NL*
another
transfusion
of
blood
,
and
that
soon
,
or
that
poor
girl
's
life
*NL*
wo
n't
be
worth
an
hour
's
purchase
.
You
are
exhausted
already
;
I
am
*NL*
exhausted
too
.
I
fear
to
trust
those
women
,
even
if
they
would
have
*NL*
courage
to
submit
.
What
are
we
to
do
for
some
one
who
will
open
his
*NL*
veins
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
me
,
anyhow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
came
from
the
sofa
across
the
room
,
and
its
tones
brought
*NL*
relief
and
joy
to
my
heart
,
for
they
were
those
of
Quincey
Morris
.
Van
*NL*
Helsing
started
angrily
at
the
first
sound
,
but
his
face
softened
and
a
*NL*
glad
look
came
into
his
eyes
as
I
cried
out
:
``
Quincey
Morris
!
''
and
*NL*
rushed
towards
him
with
outstretched
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
brought
you
here
?
''
I
cried
as
our
hands
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
Art
is
the
cause
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
me
a
telegram
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
not
heard
from
Seward
for
three
days
,
and
am
terribly
anxious
.
*NL*
Can
not
leave
.
Father
still
in
same
condition
.
Send
me
word
how
Lucy
is
.
*NL*
Do
not
delay
.
--
HOLMWOOD
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
came
just
in
the
nick
of
time
.
You
know
you
have
only
to
tell
*NL*
me
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
strode
forward
,
and
took
his
hand
,
looking
him
straight
in
*NL*
the
eyes
as
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
brave
man
's
blood
is
the
best
thing
on
this
earth
when
a
woman
is
in
*NL*
trouble
.
You
're
a
man
and
no
mistake
.
Well
,
the
devil
may
work
against
*NL*
us
for
all
he
's
worth
,
but
God
sends
us
men
when
we
want
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
again
we
went
through
that
ghastly
operation
.
I
have
not
the
heart
*NL*
to
go
through
with
the
details
.
Lucy
had
got
a
terrible
shock
and
it
*NL*
told
on
her
more
than
before
,
for
though
plenty
of
blood
went
into
her
*NL*
veins
,
her
body
did
not
respond
to
the
treatment
as
well
as
on
the
other
*NL*
occasions
.
Her
struggle
back
into
life
was
something
frightful
to
see
*NL*
and
hear
.
However
,
the
action
of
both
heart
and
lungs
improved
,
and
Van
*NL*
Helsing
made
a
subcutaneous
injection
of
morphia
,
as
before
,
and
with
*NL*
good
effect
.
Her
faint
became
a
profound
slumber
.
The
Professor
watched
*NL*
whilst
I
went
downstairs
with
Quincey
Morris
,
and
sent
one
of
the
maids
*NL*
to
pay
off
one
of
the
cabmen
who
were
waiting
.
I
left
Quincey
lying
down
*NL*
after
having
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
told
the
cook
to
get
ready
a
good
*NL*
breakfast
.
Then
a
thought
struck
me
,
and
I
went
back
to
the
room
where
*NL*
Lucy
now
was
.
When
I
came
softly
in
,
I
found
Van
Helsing
with
a
sheet
or
*NL*
two
of
note-paper
in
his
hand
.
He
had
evidently
read
it
,
and
was
*NL*
thinking
it
over
as
he
sat
with
his
hand
to
his
brow
.
There
was
a
look
*NL*
of
grim
satisfaction
in
his
face
,
as
of
one
who
has
had
a
doubt
solved
.
*NL*
He
handed
me
the
paper
saying
only
:
``
It
dropped
from
Lucy
's
breast
when
*NL*
we
carried
her
to
the
bath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
read
it
,
I
stood
looking
at
the
Professor
,
and
after
a
pause
*NL*
asked
him
:
``
In
God
's
name
,
what
does
it
all
mean
?
Was
she
,
or
is
she
,
*NL*
mad
;
or
what
sort
of
horrible
danger
is
it
?
''
I
was
so
bewildered
that
I
*NL*
did
not
know
what
to
say
more
.
Van
Helsing
put
out
his
hand
and
took
the
*NL*
paper
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
trouble
about
it
now
.
Forget
it
for
the
present
.
You
shall
know
*NL*
and
understand
it
all
in
good
time
;
but
it
will
be
later
.
And
now
what
*NL*
is
it
that
you
came
to
me
to
say
?
''
This
brought
me
back
to
fact
,
and
I
*NL*
was
all
myself
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
speak
about
the
certificate
of
death
.
If
we
do
not
act
*NL*
properly
and
wisely
,
there
may
be
an
inquest
,
and
that
paper
would
have
*NL*
to
be
produced
.
I
am
in
hopes
that
we
need
have
no
inquest
,
for
if
we
*NL*
had
it
would
surely
kill
poor
Lucy
,
if
nothing
else
did
.
I
know
,
and
you
*NL*
know
,
and
the
other
doctor
who
attended
her
knows
,
that
Mrs.
Westenra
*NL*
had
disease
of
the
heart
,
and
we
can
certify
that
she
died
of
it
.
Let
us
*NL*
fill
up
the
certificate
at
once
,
and
I
shall
take
it
myself
to
the
*NL*
registrar
and
go
on
to
the
undertaker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
oh
my
friend
John
!
Well
thought
of
!
Truly
Miss
Lucy
,
if
she
be
*NL*
sad
in
the
foes
that
beset
her
,
is
at
least
happy
in
the
friends
that
*NL*
love
her
.
One
,
two
,
three
,
all
open
their
veins
for
her
,
besides
one
old
*NL*
man
.
Ah
yes
,
I
know
,
friend
John
;
I
am
not
blind
!
I
love
you
all
the
*NL*
more
for
it
!
Now
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hall
I
met
Quincey
Morris
,
with
a
telegram
for
Arthur
telling
him
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Westenra
was
dead
;
that
Lucy
also
had
been
ill
,
but
was
now
*NL*
going
on
better
;
and
that
Van
Helsing
and
I
were
with
her
.
I
told
him
*NL*
where
I
was
going
,
and
he
hurried
me
out
,
but
as
I
was
going
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
come
back
,
Jack
,
may
I
have
two
words
with
you
all
to
*NL*
ourselves
?
''
I
nodded
in
reply
and
went
out
.
I
found
no
difficulty
about
*NL*
the
registration
,
and
arranged
with
the
local
undertaker
to
come
up
in
*NL*
the
evening
to
measure
for
the
coffin
and
to
make
arrangements
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
back
Quincey
was
waiting
for
me
.
I
told
him
I
would
see
him
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
knew
about
Lucy
,
and
went
up
to
her
room
.
She
was
still
*NL*
sleeping
,
and
the
Professor
seemingly
had
not
moved
from
his
seat
at
her
*NL*
side
.
From
his
putting
his
finger
to
his
lips
,
I
gathered
that
he
*NL*
expected
her
to
wake
before
long
and
was
afraid
of
forestalling
nature
.
*NL*
So
I
went
down
to
Quincey
and
took
him
into
the
breakfast-room
,
where
*NL*
the
blinds
were
not
drawn
down
,
and
which
was
a
little
more
cheerful
,
or
*NL*
rather
less
cheerless
,
than
the
other
rooms
.
When
we
were
alone
,
he
said
*NL*
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jack
Seward
,
I
do
n't
want
to
shove
myself
in
anywhere
where
I
've
no
*NL*
right
to
be
;
but
this
is
no
ordinary
case
.
You
know
I
loved
that
girl
*NL*
and
wanted
to
marry
her
;
but
,
although
that
's
all
past
and
gone
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
feeling
anxious
about
her
all
the
same
.
What
is
it
that
's
wrong
*NL*
with
her
?
The
Dutchman
--
and
a
fine
old
fellow
he
is
;
I
can
see
*NL*
that
--
said
,
that
time
you
two
came
into
the
room
,
that
you
must
have
*NL*
_
another
_
transfusion
of
blood
,
and
that
both
you
and
he
were
exhausted
.
*NL*
Now
I
know
well
that
you
medical
men
speak
_
in
camera
_
,
and
that
a
man
*NL*
must
not
expect
to
know
what
they
consult
about
in
private
.
But
this
is
*NL*
no
common
matter
,
and
,
whatever
it
is
,
I
have
done
my
part
.
Is
not
that
*NL*
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
,
''
I
said
,
and
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
it
that
both
you
and
Van
Helsing
had
done
already
what
I
did
*NL*
to-day
.
Is
not
that
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
guess
Art
was
in
it
too
.
When
I
saw
him
four
days
ago
down
at
his
*NL*
own
place
he
looked
queer
.
I
have
not
seen
anything
pulled
down
so
quick
*NL*
since
I
was
on
the
Pampas
and
had
a
mare
that
I
was
fond
of
go
to
grass
*NL*
all
in
a
night
.
One
of
those
big
bats
that
they
call
vampires
had
got
at
*NL*
her
in
the
night
,
and
what
with
his
gorge
and
the
vein
left
open
,
there
*NL*
was
n't
enough
blood
in
her
to
let
her
stand
up
,
and
I
had
to
put
a
*NL*
bullet
through
her
as
she
lay
.
Jack
,
if
you
may
tell
me
without
*NL*
betraying
confidence
,
Arthur
was
the
first
,
is
not
that
so
?
''
As
he
spoke
*NL*
the
poor
fellow
looked
terribly
anxious
.
He
was
in
a
torture
of
suspense
*NL*
regarding
the
woman
he
loved
,
and
his
utter
ignorance
of
the
terrible
*NL*
mystery
which
seemed
to
surround
her
intensified
his
pain
.
His
very
*NL*
heart
was
bleeding
,
and
it
took
all
the
manhood
of
him
--
and
there
was
a
*NL*
royal
lot
of
it
,
too
--
to
keep
him
from
breaking
down
.
I
paused
before
*NL*
answering
,
for
I
felt
that
I
must
not
betray
anything
which
the
*NL*
Professor
wished
kept
secret
;
but
already
he
knew
so
much
,
and
guessed
*NL*
so
much
,
that
there
could
be
no
reason
for
not
answering
,
so
I
answered
*NL*
in
the
same
phrase
:
``
That
's
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
ten
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
days
!
Then
I
guess
,
Jack
Seward
,
that
that
poor
pretty
creature
*NL*
that
we
all
love
has
had
put
into
her
veins
within
that
time
the
blood
*NL*
of
four
strong
men
.
Man
alive
,
her
whole
body
would
n't
hold
it
.
''
Then
,
*NL*
coming
close
to
me
,
he
spoke
in
a
fierce
half-whisper
:
``
What
took
it
*NL*
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
.
``
That
,
''
I
said
,
``
is
the
crux
.
Van
Helsing
is
simply
*NL*
frantic
about
it
,
and
I
am
at
my
wits
'
end
.
I
ca
n't
even
hazard
a
guess
.
*NL*
There
has
been
a
series
of
little
circumstances
which
have
thrown
out
*NL*
all
our
calculations
as
to
Lucy
being
properly
watched
.
But
these
shall
*NL*
not
occur
again
.
Here
we
stay
until
all
be
well
--
or
ill
.
''
Quincey
held
*NL*
out
his
hand
.
``
Count
me
in
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
and
the
Dutchman
will
tell
me
*NL*
what
to
do
,
and
I
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
woke
late
in
the
afternoon
,
Lucy
's
first
movement
was
to
feel
*NL*
in
her
breast
,
and
,
to
my
surprise
,
produced
the
paper
which
Van
Helsing
*NL*
had
given
me
to
read
.
The
careful
Professor
had
replaced
it
where
it
had
*NL*
come
from
,
lest
on
waking
she
should
be
alarmed
.
Her
eye
then
lit
on
Van
*NL*
Helsing
and
on
me
too
,
and
gladdened
.
Then
she
looked
around
the
room
,
*NL*
and
seeing
where
she
was
,
shuddered
;
she
gave
a
loud
cry
,
and
put
her
*NL*
poor
thin
hands
before
her
pale
face
.
We
both
understood
what
that
*NL*
meant
--
that
she
had
realised
to
the
full
her
mother
's
death
;
so
we
tried
*NL*
what
we
could
to
comfort
her
.
Doubtless
sympathy
eased
her
somewhat
,
but
*NL*
she
was
very
low
in
thought
and
spirit
,
and
wept
silently
and
weakly
for
*NL*
a
long
time
.
We
told
her
that
either
or
both
of
us
would
now
remain
with
*NL*
her
all
the
time
,
and
that
seemed
to
comfort
her
.
Towards
dusk
she
fell
*NL*
into
a
doze
.
Here
a
very
odd
thing
occurred
.
Whilst
still
asleep
she
*NL*
took
the
paper
from
her
breast
and
tore
it
in
two
.
Van
Helsing
stepped
*NL*
over
and
took
the
pieces
from
her
.
All
the
same
,
however
,
she
went
on
*NL*
with
the
action
of
tearing
,
as
though
the
material
were
still
in
her
*NL*
hands
;
finally
she
lifted
her
hands
and
opened
them
as
though
scattering
*NL*
the
fragments
.
Van
Helsing
seemed
surprised
,
and
his
brows
gathered
as
*NL*
if
in
thought
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*

*NL*
*NL*
_
19
September
.
_
--
All
last
night
she
slept
fitfully
,
being
always
afraid
*NL*
to
sleep
,
and
something
weaker
when
she
woke
from
it
.
The
Professor
and
*NL*
I
took
it
in
turns
to
watch
,
and
we
never
left
her
for
a
moment
*NL*
unattended
.
Quincey
Morris
said
nothing
about
his
intention
,
but
I
knew
*NL*
that
all
night
long
he
patrolled
round
and
round
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
day
came
,
its
searching
light
showed
the
ravages
in
poor
Lucy
's
*NL*
strength
.
She
was
hardly
able
to
turn
her
head
,
and
the
little
*NL*
nourishment
which
she
could
take
seemed
to
do
her
no
good
.
At
times
she
*NL*
slept
,
and
both
Van
Helsing
and
I
noticed
the
difference
in
her
,
between
*NL*
sleeping
and
waking
.
Whilst
asleep
she
looked
stronger
,
although
more
*NL*
haggard
,
and
her
breathing
was
softer
;
her
open
mouth
showed
the
pale
*NL*
gums
drawn
back
from
the
teeth
,
which
thus
looked
positively
longer
and
*NL*
sharper
than
usual
;
when
she
woke
the
softness
of
her
eyes
evidently
*NL*
changed
the
expression
,
for
she
looked
her
own
self
,
although
a
dying
*NL*
one
.
In
the
afternoon
she
asked
for
Arthur
,
and
we
telegraphed
for
him
.
*NL*
Quincey
went
off
to
meet
him
at
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
arrived
it
was
nearly
six
o'clock
,
and
the
sun
was
setting
full
*NL*
and
warm
,
and
the
red
light
streamed
in
through
the
window
and
gave
more
*NL*
colour
to
the
pale
cheeks
.
When
he
saw
her
,
Arthur
was
simply
choking
*NL*
with
emotion
,
and
none
of
us
could
speak
.
In
the
hours
that
had
passed
,
*NL*
the
fits
of
sleep
,
or
the
comatose
condition
that
passed
for
it
,
had
*NL*
grown
more
frequent
,
so
that
the
pauses
when
conversation
was
possible
*NL*
were
shortened
.
Arthur
's
presence
,
however
,
seemed
to
act
as
a
*NL*
stimulant
;
she
rallied
a
little
,
and
spoke
to
him
more
brightly
than
she
*NL*
had
done
since
we
arrived
.
He
too
pulled
himself
together
,
and
spoke
as
*NL*
cheerily
as
he
could
,
so
that
the
best
was
made
of
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
nearly
one
o'clock
,
and
he
and
Van
Helsing
are
sitting
with
*NL*
her
.
I
am
to
relieve
them
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
I
am
entering
*NL*
this
on
Lucy
's
phonograph
.
Until
six
o'clock
they
are
to
try
to
rest
.
I
*NL*
fear
that
to-morrow
will
end
our
watching
,
for
the
shock
has
been
too
*NL*
great
;
the
poor
child
can
not
rally
.
God
help
us
all
.

My

*NL*
``
It
seems
_
an
age
_
since
I
heard
from
you
,
or
indeed
since
I
wrote
.
You
*NL*
will
pardon
me
,
I
know
,
for
all
my
faults
when
you
have
read
all
my
*NL*
budget
of
news
.
Well
,
I
got
my
husband
back
all
right
;
when
we
arrived
*NL*
at
Exeter
there
was
a
carriage
waiting
for
us
,
and
in
it
,
though
he
had
*NL*
an
attack
of
gout
,
Mr.
Hawkins
.
He
took
us
to
his
house
,
where
there
*NL*
were
rooms
for
us
all
nice
and
comfortable
,
and
we
dined
together
.
After
*NL*
dinner
Mr.
Hawkins
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
My
dears
,
I
want
to
drink
your
health
and
prosperity
;
and
may
every

blessing
attend
you
both
.
I
know
you
both
from
children
,
and
have
,
with
*NL*
love
and
pride
,
seen
you
grow
up
.
Now
I
want
you
to
make
your
home
here
*NL*
with
me
.
I
have
left
to
me
neither
chick
nor
child
;
all
are
gone
,
and
in
*NL*
my
will
I
have
left
you
everything
.
'
I
cried
,
Lucy
dear
,
as
Jonathan
and
*NL*
the
old
man
clasped
hands
.
Our
evening
was
a
very
,
very
happy
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
here
we
are
,
installed
in
this
beautiful
old
house
,
and
from
both
my
*NL*
bedroom
and
the
drawing-room
I
can
see
the
great
elms
of
the
cathedral
*NL*
close
,
with
their
great
black
stems
standing
out
against
the
old
yellow
*NL*
stone
of
the
cathedral
and
I
can
hear
the
rooks
overhead
cawing
and
*NL*
cawing
and
chattering
and
gossiping
all
day
,
after
the
manner
of
*NL*
rooks
--
and
humans
.
I
am
busy
,
I
need
not
tell
you
,
arranging
things
and
*NL*
housekeeping
.
Jonathan
and
Mr.
Hawkins
are
busy
all
day
;
for
,
now
that
*NL*
Jonathan
is
a
partner
,
Mr.
Hawkins
wants
to
tell
him
all
about
the
*NL*
clients
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
your
dear
mother
getting
on
?
I
wish
I
could
run
up
to
town
for
a
*NL*
day
or
two
to
see
you
,
dear
,
but
I
dare
not
go
yet
,
with
so
much
on
my
*NL*
shoulders
;
and
Jonathan
wants
looking
after
still
.
He
is
beginning
to
*NL*
put
some
flesh
on
his
bones
again
,
but
he
was
terribly
weakened
by
the
*NL*
long
illness
;
even
now
he
sometimes
starts
out
of
his
sleep
in
a
sudden
*NL*
way
and
awakes
all
trembling
until
I
can
coax
him
back
to
his
usual
*NL*
placidity
.
However
,
thank
God
,
these
occasions
grow
less
frequent
as
the
*NL*
days
go
on
,
and
they
will
in
time
pass
away
altogether
,
I
trust
.
And
now
*NL*
I
have
told
you
my
news
,
let
me
ask
yours
.
When
are
you
to
be
married
,
*NL*
and
where
,
and
who
is
to
perform
the
ceremony
,
and
what
are
you
to
wear
,
*NL*
and
is
it
to
be
a
public
or
a
private
wedding
?
Tell
me
all
about
it
,
*NL*
dear
;
tell
me
all
about
everything
,
for
there
is
nothing
which
interests
*NL*
you
which
will
not
be
dear
to
me
.
Jonathan
asks
me
to
send
his
*NL*
`
respectful
duty
,
'
but
I
do
not
think
that
is
good
enough
from
the
*NL*
junior
partner
of
the
important
firm
Hawkins
&
Harker
;
and
so
,
as
you
*NL*
love
me
,
and
he
loves
me
,
and
I
love
you
with
all
the
moods

tenses
*NL*
of
the
verb
,
I
send
you
simply
his

instead

``
My
dear
Sir
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
accordance
with
your
wishes
,
I
enclose
report
of
the
conditions
of
*NL*
everything
left
in
my
charge
...
With
regard
to
patient
,
Renfield
,
there
*NL*
is
more
to
say
.
He
has
had
another
outbreak
,
which
might
have
had
a
*NL*
dreadful
ending
,
but
which
,
as
it
fortunately
happened
,
was
unattended
*NL*
with
any
unhappy
results
.
This
afternoon
a
carrier
's
cart
with
two
men
*NL*
made
a
call
at
the
empty
house
whose
grounds
abut
on
ours
--
the
house
to
*NL*
which
,
you
will
remember
,
the
patient
twice
ran
away
.
The
men
stopped
at
*NL*
our
gate
to
ask
the
porter
their
way
,
as
they
were
strangers
.
I
was
*NL*
myself
looking
out
of
the
study
window
,
having
a
smoke
after
dinner
,
and
*NL*
saw
one
of
them
come
up
to
the
house
.
As
he
passed
the
window
of
*NL*
Renfield
's
room
,
the
patient
began
to
rate
him
from
within
,
and
called
*NL*
him
all
the
foul
names
he
could
lay
his
tongue
to
.
The
man
,
who
seemed
a
*NL*
decent
fellow
enough
,
contented
himself
by
telling
him
to
``
shut
up
for
a
*NL*
foul-mouthed
beggar
,
''
whereon
our
man
accused
him
of
robbing
him
and
*NL*
wanting
to
murder
him
and
said
that
he
would
hinder
him
if
he
were
to
*NL*
swing
for
it
.
I
opened
the
window
and
signed
to
the
man
not
to
notice
,
*NL*
so
he
contented
himself
after
looking
the
place
over
and
making
up
his
*NL*
mind
as
to
what
kind
of
a
place
he
had
got
to
by
saying
:
`
Lor
'
bless
*NL*
yer
,
sir
,
I
would
n't
mind
what
was
said
to
me
in
a
bloomin
'
madhouse
.
I
*NL*
pity
ye
and
the
guv
`
nor
for
havin
'
to
live
in
the
house
with
a
wild
*NL*
beast
like
that
.
'
Then
he
asked
his
way
civilly
enough
,
and
I
told
him
*NL*
where
the
gate
of
the
empty
house
was
;
he
went
away
,
followed
by
threats
*NL*
and
curses
and
revilings
from
our
man
.
I
went
down
to
see
if
I
could
*NL*
make
out
any
cause
for
his
anger
,
since
he
is
usually
such
a
*NL*
well-behaved
man
,
and
except
his
violent
fits
nothing
of
the
kind
had
*NL*
ever
occurred
.
I
found
him
,
to
my
astonishment
,
quite
composed
and
most
*NL*
genial
in
his
manner
.
I
tried
to
get
him
to
talk
of
the
incident
,
but
he
*NL*
blandly
asked
me
questions
as
to
what
I
meant
,
and
led
me
to
believe
*NL*
that
he
was
completely
oblivious
of
the
affair
.
It
was
,
I
am
sorry
to
*NL*
say
,
however
,
only
another
instance
of
his
cunning
,
for
within
half
an
*NL*
hour
I
heard
of
him
again
.
This
time
he
had
broken
out
through
the
*NL*
window
of
his
room
,
and
was
running
down
the
avenue
.
I
called
to
the
*NL*
attendants
to
follow
me
,
and
ran
after
him
,
for
I
feared
he
was
intent
*NL*
on
some
mischief
.
My
fear
was
justified
when
I
saw
the
same
cart
which
*NL*
had
passed
before
coming
down
the
road
,
having
on
it
some
great
wooden
*NL*
boxes
.
The
men
were
wiping
their
foreheads
,
and
were
flushed
in
the
*NL*
face
,
as
if
with
violent
exercise
.
Before
I
could
get
up
to
him
the
*NL*
patient
rushed
at
them
,
and
pulling
one
of
them
off
the
cart
,
began
to
*NL*
knock
his
head
against
the
ground
.
If
I
had
not
seized
him
just
at
the
*NL*
moment
I
believe
he
would
have
killed
the
man
there
and
then
.
The
other
*NL*
fellow
jumped
down
and
struck
him
over
the
head
with
the
butt-end
of
his
*NL*
heavy
whip
.
It
was
a
terrible
blow
;
but
he
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
,
but
*NL*
seized
him
also
,
and
struggled
with
the
three
of
us
,
pulling
us
to
and
*NL*
fro
as
if
we
were
kittens
.
You
know
I
am
no
light
weight
,
and
the
others
*NL*
were
both
burly
men
.
At
first
he
was
silent
in
his
fighting
;
but
as
we
*NL*
began
to
master
him
,
and
the
attendants
were
putting
a
strait-waistcoat
*NL*
on
him
,
he
began
to
shout
:
`
I
'll
frustrate
them
!
They
sha
n't
rob
me
!
*NL*
they
sha
n't
murder
me
by
inches
!
I
'll
fight
for
my
Lord
and
Master
!
'
and
*NL*
all
sorts
of
similar
incoherent
ravings
.
It
was
with
very
considerable
*NL*
difficulty
that
they
got
him
back
to
the
house
and
put
him
in
the
padded
*NL*
room
.
One
of
the
attendants
,
Hardy
,
had
a
finger
broken
.
However
,
I
set
*NL*
it
all
right
;
and
he
is
going
on
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
two
carriers
were
at
first
loud
in
their
threats
of
actions
for
*NL*
damages
,
and
promised
to
rain
all
the
penalties
of
the
law
on
us
.
Their
*NL*
threats
were
,
however
,
mingled
with
some
sort
of
indirect
apology
for
*NL*
the
defeat
of
the
two
of
them
by
a
feeble
madman
.
They
said
that
if
it
*NL*
had
not
been
for
the
way
their
strength
had
been
spent
in
carrying
and
*NL*
raising
the
heavy
boxes
to
the
cart
they
would
have
made
short
work
of
*NL*
him
.
They
gave
as
another
reason
for
their
defeat
the
extraordinary
*NL*
state
of
drouth
to
which
they
had
been
reduced
by
the
dusty
nature
of
*NL*
their
occupation
and
the
reprehensible
distance
from
the
scene
of
their
*NL*
labours
of
any
place
of
public
entertainment
.
I
quite
understood
their
*NL*
drift
,
and
after
a
stiff
glass
of
grog
,
or
rather
more
of
the
same
,
and
*NL*
with
each
a
sovereign
in
hand
,
they
made
light
of
the
attack
,
and
swore
*NL*
that
they
would
encounter
a
worse
madman
any
day
for
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
meeting
so
`
bloomin
'
good
a
bloke

as
your

I
took
their
*NL*
names
and

,
in

they
might
be
needed

They

*NL*
``
Such
a
sad
blow
has
befallen
us
.
Mr.
Hawkins
has
died
very
suddenly
.
*NL*
Some
may
not
think
it
so
sad
for
us
,
but
we
had
both
come
to
so
love
him
*NL*
that
it
really
seems
as
though
we
had
lost
a
father
.
I
never
knew
either
*NL*
father
or
mother
,
so
that
the
dear
old
man
's
death
is
a
real
blow
to
me
.
*NL*
Jonathan
is
greatly
distressed
.
It
is
not
only
that
he
feels
sorrow
,
*NL*
deep
sorrow
,
for
the
dear
,
good
man
who
has
befriended
him
all
his
life
,
*NL*
and
now
at
the
end
has
treated
him
like
his
own
son
and
left
him
a
*NL*
fortune
which
to
people
of
our
modest
bringing
up
is
wealth
beyond
the
*NL*
dream
of
avarice
,
but
Jonathan
feels
it
on
another
account
.
He
says
the
*NL*
amount
of
responsibility
which
it
puts
upon
him
makes
him
nervous
.
He
*NL*
begins
to
doubt
himself
.
I
try
to
cheer
him
up
,
and
_
my
_
belief
in
_
him
_
*NL*
helps
him
to
have
a
belief
in
himself
.
But
it
is
here
that
the
grave
*NL*
shock
that
he
experienced
tells
upon
him
the
most
.
Oh
,
it
is
too
hard
*NL*
that
a
sweet
,
simple
,
noble
,
strong
nature
such
as
his
--
a
nature
which
*NL*
enabled
him
by
our
dear
,
good
friend
's
aid
to
rise
from
clerk
to
master
*NL*
in
a
few
years
--
should
be
so
injured
that
the
very
essence
of
its
*NL*
strength
is
gone
.
Forgive
me
,
dear
,
if
I
worry
you
with
my
troubles
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
your
own
happiness
;
but
,
Lucy
dear
,
I
must
tell
some
one
,
*NL*
for
the
strain
of
keeping
up
a
brave
and
cheerful
appearance
to
Jonathan
*NL*
tries
me
,
and
I
have
no
one
here
that
I
can
confide
in
.
I
dread
coming
*NL*
up
to
London
,
as
we
must
do
the
day
after
to-morrow
;
for
poor
Mr.
*NL*
Hawkins
left
in
his
will
that
he
was
to
be
buried
in
the
grave
with
his
*NL*
father
.
As
there
are
no
relations
at
all
,
Jonathan
will
have
to
be
chief
*NL*
mourner
.
I
shall
try
to
run
over
to
see
you
,
dearest
,
if
only
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
.
Forgive
me
for
troubling
you

--
Only
resolution
and
habit
can
let
me
make
an
entry
*NL*
to-night
.
I
am
too
miserable
,
too
low-spirited
,
too
sick
of
the
world
*NL*
and
all
in
it
,
including
life
itself
,
that
I
would
not
care
if
I
heard
*NL*
this
moment
the
flapping
of
the
wings
of
the
angel
of
death
.
And
he
has
*NL*
been
flapping
those
grim
wings
to
some
purpose
of
late
--
Lucy
's
mother
*NL*
and
Arthur
's
father
,
and
now
...
Let
me
get
on
with
my
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
duly
relieved
Van
Helsing
in
his
watch
over
Lucy
.
We
wanted
Arthur
to
*NL*
go
to
rest
also
,
but
he
refused
at
first
.
It
was
only
when
I
told
him
*NL*
that
we
should
want
him
to
help
us
during
the
day
,
and
that
we
must
not
*NL*
all
break
down
for
want
of
rest
,
lest
Lucy
should
suffer
,
that
he
agreed
*NL*
to
go
.
Van
Helsing
was
very
kind
to
him
.
``
Come
,
my
child
,
''
he
said
;
*NL*
``
come
with
me
.
You
are
sick
and
weak
,
and
have
had
much
sorrow
and
much
*NL*
mental
pain
,
as
well
as
that
tax
on
your
strength
that
we
know
of
.
You
*NL*
must
not
be
alone
;
for
to
be
alone
is
to
be
full
of
fears
and
alarms
.
*NL*
Come
to
the
drawing-room
,
where
there
is
a
big
fire
,
and
there
are
two
*NL*
sofas
.
You
shall
lie
on
one
,
and
I
on
the
other
,
and
our
sympathy
will
*NL*
be
comfort
to
each
other
,
even
though
we
do
not
speak
,
and
even
if
we
*NL*
sleep
.
''
Arthur
went
off
with
him
,
casting
back
a
longing
look
on
Lucy
's
*NL*
face
,
which
lay
in
her
pillow
,
almost
whiter
than
the
lawn
.
She
lay
*NL*
quite
still
,
and
I
looked
round
the
room
to
see
that
all
was
as
it
*NL*
should
be
.
I
could
see
that
the
Professor
had
carried
out
in
this
room
,
*NL*
as
in
the
other
,
his
purpose
of
using
the
garlic
;
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
window-sashes
reeked
with
it
,
and
round
Lucy
's
neck
,
over
the
silk
*NL*
handkerchief
which
Van
Helsing
made
her
keep
on
,
was
a
rough
chaplet
of
*NL*
the
same
odorous
flowers
.
Lucy
was
breathing
somewhat
stertorously
,
and
*NL*
her
face
was
at
its
worst
,
for
the
open
mouth
showed
the
pale
gums
.
Her
*NL*
teeth
,
in
the
dim
,
uncertain
light
,
seemed
longer
and
sharper
than
they
*NL*
had
been
in
the
morning
.
In
particular
,
by
some
trick
of
the
light
,
the
*NL*
canine
teeth
looked
longer
and
sharper
than
the
rest
.
I
sat
down
by
her
,
*NL*
and
presently
she
moved
uneasily
.
At
the
same
moment
there
came
a
sort
*NL*
of
dull
flapping
or
buffeting
at
the
window
.
I
went
over
to
it
softly
,
*NL*
and
peeped
out
by
the
corner
of
the
blind
.
There
was
a
full
moonlight
,
*NL*
and
I
could
see
that
the
noise
was
made
by
a
great
bat
,
which
wheeled
*NL*
round
--
doubtless
attracted
by
the
light
,
although
so
dim
--
and
every
now
*NL*
and
again
struck
the
window
with
its
wings
.
When
I
came
back
to
my
seat
,
*NL*
I
found
that
Lucy
had
moved
slightly
,
and
had
torn
away
the
garlic
*NL*
flowers
from
her
throat
.
I
replaced
them
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
sat
*NL*
watching
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
woke
,
and
I
gave
her
food
,
as
Van
Helsing
had
prescribed
.
*NL*
She
took
but
a
little
,
and
that
languidly
.
There
did
not
seem
to
be
with
*NL*
her
now
the
unconscious
struggle
for
life
and
strength
that
had
hitherto
*NL*
so
marked
her
illness
.
It
struck
me
as
curious
that
the
moment
she
*NL*
became
conscious
she
pressed
the
garlic
flowers
close
to
her
.
It
was
*NL*
certainly
odd
that
whenever
she
got
into
that
lethargic
state
,
with
the
*NL*
stertorous
breathing
,
she
put
the
flowers
from
her
;
but
that
when
she
*NL*
waked
she
clutched
them
close
.
There
was
no
possibility
of
making
any
*NL*
mistake
about
this
,
for
in
the
long
hours
that
followed
,
she
had
many
*NL*
spells
of
sleeping
and
waking
and
repeated
both
actions
many
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
o'clock
Van
Helsing
came
to
relieve
me
.
Arthur
had
then
fallen
*NL*
into
a
doze
,
and
he
mercifully
let
him
sleep
on
.
When
he
saw
Lucy
's
face
*NL*
I
could
hear
the
sissing
indraw
of
his
breath
,
and
he
said
to
me
in
a
*NL*
sharp
whisper
:
``
Draw
up
the
blind
;
I
want
light
!
''
Then
he
bent
down
,
*NL*
and
,
with
his
face
almost
touching
Lucy
's
,
examined
her
carefully
.
He
*NL*
removed
the
flowers
and
lifted
the
silk
handkerchief
from
her
throat
.
As
*NL*
he
did
so
he
started
back
,
and
I
could
hear
his
ejaculation
,
``
Mein
*NL*
Gott
!
''
as
it
was
smothered
in
his
throat
.
I
bent
over
and
looked
,
too
,
*NL*
and
as
I
noticed
some
queer
chill
came
over
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wounds
on
the
throat
had
absolutely
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
fully
five
minutes
Van
Helsing
stood
looking
at
her
,
with
his
face
*NL*
at
its
sternest
.
Then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
calmly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
dying
.
It
will
not
be
long
now
.
It
will
be
much
difference
,
mark
*NL*
me
,
whether
she
dies
conscious
or
in
her
sleep
.
Wake
that
poor
boy
,
and
*NL*
let
him
come
and
see
the
last
;
he
trusts
us
,
and
we
have
promised
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
the
dining-room
and
waked
him
.
He
was
dazed
for
a
moment
,
but
*NL*
when
he
saw
the
sunlight
streaming
in
through
the
edges
of
the
shutters
*NL*
he
thought
he
was
late
,
and
expressed
his
fear
.
I
assured
him
that
Lucy
*NL*
was
still
asleep
,
but
told
him
as
gently
as
I
could
that
both
Van
*NL*
Helsing
and
I
feared
that
the
end
was
near
.
He
covered
his
face
with
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
slid
down
on
his
knees
by
the
sofa
,
where
he
remained
,
*NL*
perhaps
a
minute
,
with
his
head
buried
,
praying
,
whilst
his
shoulders
*NL*
shook
with
grief
.
I
took
him
by
the
hand
and
raised
him
up
.
``
Come
,
''
I
*NL*
said
,
``
my
dear
old
fellow
,
summon
all
your
fortitude
:
it
will
be
best
*NL*
and
easiest
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
into
Lucy
's
room
I
could
see
that
Van
Helsing
had
,
with
*NL*
his
usual
forethought
,
been
putting
matters
straight
and
making
*NL*
everything
look
as
pleasing
as
possible
.
He
had
even
brushed
Lucy
's
*NL*
hair
,
so
that
it
lay
on
the
pillow
in
its
usual
sunny
ripples
.
When
we
*NL*
came
into
the
room
she
opened
her
eyes
,
and
seeing
him
,
whispered
*NL*
softly

*NL*
``
Arthur
!
Oh
,
my
love
,
I
am
so
glad
you
have
come
!
''
He
was
stooping
to
*NL*
kiss
her
,
when
Van
Helsing
motioned
him
back
.
``
No
,
''
he
whispered
,
``
not
*NL*
yet
!
Hold
her
hand
;
it
will
comfort
her
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Arthur
took
her
hand
and
knelt
beside
her
,
and
she
looked
her
best
,
*NL*
with
all
the
soft
lines
matching
the
angelic
beauty
of
her
eyes
.
Then
*NL*
gradually
her
eyes
closed
,
and
she
sank
to
sleep
.
For
a
little
bit
her
*NL*
breast
heaved
softly
,
and
her
breath
came
and
went
like
a
tired
child
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
insensibly
there
came
the
strange
change
which
I
had
noticed
in
*NL*
the
night
.
Her
breathing
grew
stertorous
,
the
mouth
opened
,
and
the
pale
*NL*
gums
,
drawn
back
,
made
the
teeth
look
longer
and
sharper
than
ever
.
In
a
*NL*
sort
of
sleep-waking
,
vague
,
unconscious
way
she
opened
her
eyes
,
which
*NL*
were
now
dull
and
hard
at
once
,
and
said
in
a
soft
,
voluptuous
voice
,
*NL*
such
as
I
had
never
heard
from
her
lips
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arthur
!
Oh
,
my
love
,
I
am
so
glad
you
have
come
!
Kiss
me
!
''
Arthur
bent
*NL*
eagerly
over
to
kiss
her
;
but
at
that
instant
Van
Helsing
,
who
,
like
me
,
*NL*
had
been
startled
by
her
voice
,
swooped
upon
him
,
and
catching
him
by
*NL*
the
neck
with
both
hands
,
dragged
him
back
with
a
fury
of
strength
which
*NL*
I
never
thought
he
could
have
possessed
,
and
actually
hurled
him
almost
*NL*
across
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
your
life
!
''
he
said
;
``
not
for
your
living
soul
and
hers
!
''
And
*NL*
he
stood
between
them
like
a
lion
at
bay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
was
so
taken
aback
that
he
did
not
for
a
moment
know
what
to
do
*NL*
or
say
;
and
before
any
impulse
of
violence
could
seize
him
he
realised
*NL*
the
place
and
the
occasion
,
and
stood
silent
,
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
Lucy
,
as
did
Van
Helsing
,
and
we
saw
a
spasm
as
*NL*
of
rage
flit
like
a
shadow
over
her
face
;
the
sharp
teeth
champed
*NL*
together
.
Then
her
eyes
closed
,
and
she
breathed
heavily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
shortly
after
she
opened
her
eyes
in
all
their
softness
,
and
*NL*
putting
out
her
poor
,
pale
,
thin
hand
,
took
Van
Helsing
's
great
brown
*NL*
one
;
drawing
it
to
her
,
she
kissed
it
.
``
My
true
friend
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
*NL*
faint
voice
,
but
with
untellable
pathos
,
``
My
true
friend
,
and
his
!
Oh
,
*NL*
guard
him
,
and
give
me
peace
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
it
!
''
he
said
solemnly
,
kneeling
beside
her
and
holding
up
his
*NL*
hand
,
as
one
who
registers
an
oath
.
Then
he
turned
to
Arthur
,
and
said
*NL*
to
him
:
``
Come
,
my
child
,
take
her
hand
in
yours
,
and
kiss
her
on
the
*NL*
forehead
,
and
only
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
eyes
met
instead
of
their
lips
;
and
so
they
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucy
's
eyes
closed
;
and
Van
Helsing
,
who
had
been
watching
closely
,
took
*NL*
Arthur
's
arm
,
and
drew
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Lucy
's
breathing
became
stertorous
again
,
and
all
at
once
it
*NL*
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
over
,
''
said
Van
Helsing
.
``
She
is
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
Arthur
by
the
arm
,
and
led
him
away
to
the
drawing-room
,
where
he
*NL*
sat
down
,
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
,
sobbing
in
a
way
that
*NL*
nearly
broke
me
down
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
back
to
the
room
,
and
found
Van
Helsing
looking
at
poor
Lucy
,
and
*NL*
his
face
was
sterner
than
ever
.
Some
change
had
come
over
her
body
.
*NL*
Death
had
given
back
part
of
her
beauty
,
for
her
brow
and
cheeks
had
*NL*
recovered
some
of
their
flowing
lines
;
even
the
lips
had
lost
their
*NL*
deadly
pallor
.
It
was
as
if
the
blood
,
no
longer
needed
for
the
working
*NL*
of
the
heart
,
had
gone
to
make
the
harshness
of
death
as
little
rude
as
*NL*
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
her
dying
whilst
she
slept
,
*NL*
And
sleeping
when
she
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
beside
Van
Helsing
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
poor
girl
,
there
is
peace
for
her
at
last
.
It
is
the
end
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
me
,
and
said
with
grave
solemnity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
;
alas
!
not
so
.
It
is
only
the
beginning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
asked
him
what
he
meant
,
he
only
shook
his
head
and
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
do
nothing
as
yet
.
Wait
and
see
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
DR.
SEWARD
'S
DIARY
--
_
continued
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
funeral
was
arranged
for
the
next
succeeding
day
,
so
that
Lucy
and
*NL*
her
mother
might
be
buried
together
.
I
attended
to
all
the
ghastly
*NL*
formalities
,
and
the
urbane
undertaker
proved
that
his
staff
were
*NL*
afflicted
--
or
blessed
--
with
something
of
his
own
obsequious
suavity
.
*NL*
Even
the
woman
who
performed
the
last
offices
for
the
dead
remarked
to
*NL*
me
,
in
a
confidential
,
brother-professional
way
,
when
she
had
come
out
*NL*
from
the
death-chamber
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
makes
a
very
beautiful
corpse
,
sir
.
It
's
quite
a
privilege
to
*NL*
attend
on
her
.
It
's
not
too
much
to
say
that
she
will
do
credit
to
our
*NL*
establishment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
noticed
that
Van
Helsing
never
kept
far
away
.
This
was
possible
from
*NL*
the
disordered
state
of
things
in
the
household
.
There
were
no
relatives
*NL*
at
hand
;
and
as
Arthur
had
to
be
back
the
next
day
to
attend
at
his
*NL*
father
's
funeral
,
we
were
unable
to
notify
any
one
who
should
have
been
*NL*
bidden
.
Under
the
circumstances
,
Van
Helsing
and
I
took
it
upon
*NL*
ourselves
to
examine
papers
,
etc.
.
He
insisted
upon
looking
over
Lucy
's
*NL*
papers
himself
.
I
asked
him
why
,
for
I
feared
that
he
,
being
a
*NL*
foreigner
,
might
not
be
quite
aware
of
English
legal
requirements
,
and
*NL*
so
might
in
ignorance
make
some
unnecessary
trouble
.
He
answered
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
;
I
know
.
You
forget
that
I
am
a
lawyer
as
well
as
a
doctor
.
But
*NL*
this
is
not
altogether
for
the
law
.
You
knew
that
,
when
you
avoided
the
*NL*
coroner
.
I
have
more
than
him
to
avoid
.
There
may
be
papers
more
--
such
*NL*
as
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
he
took
from
his
pocket-book
the
memorandum
which
had
been
*NL*
in
Lucy
's
breast
,
and
which
she
had
torn
in
her
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
find
anything
of
the
solicitor
who
is
for
the
late
Mrs.
*NL*
Westenra
,
seal
all
her
papers
,
and
write
him
to-night
.
For
me
,
I
watch
*NL*
here
in
the
room
and
in
Miss
Lucy
's
old
room
all
night
,
and
I
myself
*NL*
search
for
what
may
be
.
It
is
not
well
that
her
very
thoughts
go
into
*NL*
the
hands
of
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
on
with
my
part
of
the
work
,
and
in
another
half
hour
had
found
*NL*
the
name
and
address
of
Mrs.
Westenra
's
solicitor
and
had
written
to
*NL*
him
.
All
the
poor
lady
's
papers
were
in
order
;
explicit
directions
*NL*
regarding
the
place
of
burial
were
given
.
I
had
hardly
sealed
the
*NL*
letter
,
when
,
to
my
surprise
,
Van
Helsing
walked
into
the
room
,
*NL*
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
help
you
,
friend
John
?
I
am
free
,
and
if
I
may
,
my
service
is
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
what
you
looked
for
?
''
I
asked
,
to
which
he
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
look
for
any
specific
thing
.
I
only
hoped
to
find
,
and
find
I
*NL*
have
,
all
that
there
was
--
only
some
letters
and
a
few
memoranda
,
and
a
*NL*
diary
new
begun
.
But
I
have
them
here
,
and
we
shall
for
the
present
say
*NL*
nothing
of
them
.
I
shall
see
that
poor
lad
to-morrow
evening
,
and
,
with
*NL*
his
sanction
,
I
shall
use
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
finished
the
work
in
hand
,
he
said
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
friend
John
,
I
think
we
may
to
bed
.
We
want
sleep
,
both
you
*NL*
and
I
,
and
rest
to
recuperate
.
To-morrow
we
shall
have
much
to
do
,
but
*NL*
for
the
to-night
there
is
no
need
of
us
.
Alas
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
turning
in
we
went
to
look
at
poor
Lucy
.
The
undertaker
had
*NL*
certainly
done
his
work
well
,
for
the
room
was
turned
into
a
small
*NL*
_
chapelle
ardente
_
.
There
was
a
wilderness
of
beautiful
white
flowers
,
*NL*
and
death
was
made
as
little
repulsive
as
might
be
.
The
end
of
the
*NL*
winding-sheet
was
laid
over
the
face
;
when
the
Professor
bent
over
and
*NL*
turned
it
gently
back
,
we
both
started
at
the
beauty
before
us
,
the
tall
*NL*
wax
candles
showing
a
sufficient
light
to
note
it
well
.
All
Lucy
's
*NL*
loveliness
had
come
back
to
her
in
death
,
and
the
hours
that
had
passed
,
*NL*
instead
of
leaving
traces
of
``
decay
's
effacing
fingers
,
''
had
but
*NL*
restored
the
beauty
of
life
,
till
positively
I
could
not
believe
my
eyes
*NL*
that
I
was
looking
at
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Professor
looked
sternly
grave
.
He
had
not
loved
her
as
I
had
,
and
*NL*
there
was
no
need
for
tears
in
his
eyes
.
He
said
to
me
:
``
Remain
till
I
*NL*
return
,
''
and
left
the
room
.
He
came
back
with
a
handful
of
wild
garlic
*NL*
from
the
box
waiting
in
the
hall
,
but
which
had
not
been
opened
,
and
*NL*
placed
the
flowers
amongst
the
others
on
and
around
the
bed
.
Then
he
*NL*
took
from
his
neck
,
inside
his
collar
,
a
little
gold
crucifix
,
and
*NL*
placed
it
over
the
mouth
.
He
restored
the
sheet
to
its
place
,
and
we
*NL*
came
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
undressing
in
my
own
room
,
when
,
with
a
premonitory
tap
at
the
*NL*
door
,
he
entered
,
and
at
once
began
to
speak
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
I
want
you
to
bring
me
,
before
night
,
a
set
of
post-mortem
*NL*
knives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
we
make
an
autopsy
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
and
no
.
I
want
to
operate
,
but
not
as
you
think
.
Let
me
tell
you
*NL*
now
,
but
not
a
word
to
another
.
I
want
to
cut
off
her
head
and
take
out
*NL*
her
heart
.
Ah
!
you
a
surgeon
,
and
so
shocked
!
You
,
whom
I
have
seen
with
*NL*
no
tremble
of
hand
or
heart
,
do
operations
of
life
and
death
that
make
*NL*
the
rest
shudder
.
Oh
,
but
I
must
not
forget
,
my
dear
friend
John
,
that
*NL*
you
loved
her
;
and
I
have
not
forgotten
it
,
for
it
is
I
that
shall
*NL*
operate
,
and
you
must
only
help
.
I
would
like
to
do
it
to-night
,
but
for
*NL*
Arthur
I
must
not
;
he
will
be
free
after
his
father
's
funeral
to-morrow
,
*NL*
and
he
will
want
to
see
her
--
to
see
_
it
_
.
Then
,
when
she
is
coffined
*NL*
ready
for
the
next
day
,
you
and
I
shall
come
when
all
sleep
.
We
shall
*NL*
unscrew
the
coffin-lid
,
and
shall
do
our
operation
:
and
then
replace
*NL*
all
,
so
that
none
know
,
save
we
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
do
it
at
all
?
The
girl
is
dead
.
Why
mutilate
her
poor
body
*NL*
without
need
?
And
if
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
post-mortem
and
nothing
*NL*
to
gain
by
it
--
no
good
to
her
,
to
us
,
to
science
,
to
human
*NL*
knowledge
--
why
do
it
?
Without
such
it
is
monstrous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
answer
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
and
said
,
with
infinite
*NL*
tenderness
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
John
,
I
pity
your
poor
bleeding
heart
;
and
I
love
you
the
more
*NL*
because
it
does
so
bleed
.
If
I
could
,
I
would
take
on
myself
the
burden
*NL*
that
you
do
bear
.
But
there
are
things
that
you
know
not
,
but
that
you
*NL*
shall
know
,
and
bless
me
for
knowing
,
though
they
are
not
pleasant
*NL*
things
.
John
,
my
child
,
you
have
been
my
friend
now
many
years
,
and
yet
*NL*
did
you
ever
know
me
to
do
any
without
good
cause
?
I
may
err
--
I
am
but
*NL*
man
;
but
I
believe
in
all
I
do
.
Was
it
not
for
these
causes
that
you
*NL*
send
for
me
when
the
great
trouble
came
?
Yes
!
Were
you
not
amazed
,
nay
*NL*
horrified
,
when
I
would
not
let
Arthur
kiss
his
love
--
though
she
was
*NL*
dying
--
and
snatched
him
away
by
all
my
strength
?
Yes
!
And
yet
you
saw
*NL*
how
she
thanked
me
,
with
her
so
beautiful
dying
eyes
,
her
voice
,
too
,
so
*NL*
weak
,
and
she
kiss
my
rough
old
hand
and
bless
me
?
Yes
!
And
did
you
not
*NL*
hear
me
swear
promise
to
her
,
that
so
she
closed
her
eyes
grateful
?
Yes
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
good
reason
now
for
all
I
want
to
do
.
You
have
for
many
*NL*
years
trust
me
;
you
have
believe
me
weeks
past
,
when
there
be
things
so
*NL*
strange
that
you
might
have
well
doubt
.
Believe
me
yet
a
little
,
friend
*NL*
John
.
If
you
trust
me
not
,
then
I
must
tell
what
I
think
;
and
that
is
*NL*
not
perhaps
well
.
And
if
I
work
--
as
work
I
shall
,
no
matter
trust
or
no
*NL*
trust
--
without
my
friend
trust
in
me
,
I
work
with
heavy
heart
and
feel
,
*NL*
oh
!
so
lonely
when
I
want
all
help
and
courage
that
may
be
!
''
He
paused
a
*NL*
moment
and
went
on
solemnly
:
``
Friend
John
,
there
are
strange
and
*NL*
terrible
days
before
us
.
Let
us
not
be
two
,
but
one
,
that
so
we
work
to
*NL*
a
good
end
.
Will
you
not
have
faith
in
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
his
hand
,
and
promised
him
.
I
held
my
door
open
as
he
went
away
,
*NL*
and
watched
him
go
into
his
room
and
close
the
door
.
As
I
stood
without
*NL*
moving
,
I
saw
one
of
the
maids
pass
silently
along
the
passage
--
she
had
*NL*
her
back
towards
me
,
so
did
not
see
me
--
and
go
into
the
room
where
Lucy
*NL*
lay
.
The
sight
touched
me
.
Devotion
is
so
rare
,
and
we
are
so
grateful
*NL*
to
those
who
show
it
unasked
to
those
we
love
.
Here
was
a
poor
girl
*NL*
putting
aside
the
terrors
which
she
naturally
had
of
death
to
go
watch
*NL*
alone
by
the
bier
of
the
mistress
whom
she
loved
,
so
that
the
poor
clay
*NL*
might
not
be
lonely
till
laid
to
eternal
rest
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
have
slept
long
and
soundly
,
for
it
was
broad
daylight
when
Van
*NL*
Helsing
waked
me
by
coming
into
my
room
.
He
came
over
to
my
bedside
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
trouble
about
the
knives
;
we
shall
not
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
I
asked
.
For
his
solemnity
of
the
night
before
had
greatly
*NL*
impressed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
he
said
sternly
,
``
it
is
too
late
--
or
too
early
.
See
!
''
Here
he
*NL*
held
up
the
little
golden
crucifix
.
``
This
was
stolen
in
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
stolen
,
''
I
asked
in
wonder
,
``
since
you
have
it
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
get
it
back
from
the
worthless
wretch
who
stole
it
,
from
the
*NL*
woman
who
robbed
the
dead
and
the
living
.
Her
punishment
will
surely
*NL*
come
,
but
not
through
me
;
she
knew
not
altogether
what
she
did
and
thus
*NL*
unknowing
,
she
only
stole
.
Now
we
must
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
away
on
the
word
,
leaving
me
with
a
new
mystery
to
think
of
,
a
*NL*
new
puzzle
to
grapple
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
forenoon
was
a
dreary
time
,
but
at
noon
the
solicitor
came
:
Mr.
*NL*
Marquand
,
of
Wholeman
,
Sons
,
Marquand
&
Lidderdale
.
He
was
very
genial
*NL*
and
very
appreciative
of
what
we
had
done
,
and
took
off
our
hands
all
*NL*
cares
as
to
details
.
During
lunch
he
told
us
that
Mrs.
Westenra
had
for
*NL*
some
time
expected
sudden
death
from
her
heart
,
and
had
put
her
affairs
*NL*
in
absolute
order
;
he
informed
us
that
,
with
the
exception
of
a
certain
*NL*
entailed
property
of
Lucy
's
father
's
which
now
,
in
default
of
direct
*NL*
issue
,
went
back
to
a
distant
branch
of
the
family
,
the
whole
estate
,
*NL*
real
and
personal
,
was
left
absolutely
to
Arthur
Holmwood
.
When
he
had
*NL*
told
us
so
much
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frankly
we
did
our
best
to
prevent
such
a
testamentary
disposition
,
and
*NL*
pointed
out
certain
contingencies
that
might
leave
her
daughter
either
*NL*
penniless
or
not
so
free
as
she
should
be
to
act
regarding
a
matrimonial
*NL*
alliance
.
Indeed
,
we
pressed
the
matter
so
far
that
we
almost
came
into
*NL*
collision
,
for
she
asked
us
if
we
were
or
were
not
prepared
to
carry
out
*NL*
her
wishes
.
Of
course
,
we
had
then
no
alternative
but
to
accept
.
We
were
*NL*
right
in
principle
,
and
ninety-nine
times
out
of
a
hundred
we
should
*NL*
have
proved
,
by
the
logic
of
events
,
the
accuracy
of
our
judgment
.
*NL*
Frankly
,
however
,
I
must
admit
that
in
this
case
any
other
form
of
*NL*
disposition
would
have
rendered
impossible
the
carrying
out
of
her
*NL*
wishes
.
For
by
her
predeceasing
her
daughter
the
latter
would
have
come
*NL*
into
possession
of
the
property
,
and
,
even
had
she
only
survived
her
*NL*
mother
by
five
minutes
,
her
property
would
,
in
case
there
were
no
*NL*
will
--
and
a
will
was
a
practical
impossibility
in
such
a
case
--
have
been
*NL*
treated
at
her
decease
as
under
intestacy
.
In
which
case
Lord
Godalming
,
*NL*
though
so
dear
a
friend
,
would
have
had
no
claim
in
the
world
;
and
the
*NL*
inheritors
,
being
remote
,
would
not
be
likely
to
abandon
their
just
*NL*
rights
,
for
sentimental
reasons
regarding
an
entire
stranger
.
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
my
dear
sirs
,
I
am
rejoiced
at
the
result
,
perfectly
rejoiced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
good
fellow
,
but
his
rejoicing
at
the
one
little
part
--
in
which
*NL*
he
was
officially
interested
--
of
so
great
a
tragedy
,
was
an
*NL*
object-lesson
in
the
limitations
of
sympathetic
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
remain
long
,
but
said
he
would
look
in
later
in
the
day
and
*NL*
see
Lord
Godalming
.
His
coming
,
however
,
had
been
a
certain
comfort
to
*NL*
us
,
since
it
assured
us
that
we
should
not
have
to
dread
hostile
*NL*
criticism
as
to
any
of
our
acts
.
Arthur
was
expected
at
five
o'clock
,
so
*NL*
a
little
before
that
time
we
visited
the
death-chamber
.
It
was
so
in
*NL*
very
truth
,
for
now
both
mother
and
daughter
lay
in
it
.
The
undertaker
,
*NL*
true
to
his
craft
,
had
made
the
best
display
he
could
of
his
goods
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
mortuary
air
about
the
place
that
lowered
our
spirits
at
*NL*
once
.
Van
Helsing
ordered
the
former
arrangement
to
be
adhered
to
,
*NL*
explaining
that
,
as
Lord
Godalming
was
coming
very
soon
,
it
would
be
*NL*
less
harrowing
to
his
feelings
to
see
all
that
was
left
of
his
_
fiancee
_
*NL*
quite
alone
.
The
undertaker
seemed
shocked
at
his
own
stupidity
and
*NL*
exerted
himself
to
restore
things
to
the
condition
in
which
we
left
them
*NL*
the
night
before
,
so
that
when
Arthur
came
such
shocks
to
his
feelings
*NL*
as
we
could
avoid
were
saved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
fellow
!
He
looked
desperately
sad
and
broken
;
even
his
stalwart
*NL*
manhood
seemed
to
have
shrunk
somewhat
under
the
strain
of
his
*NL*
much-tried
emotions
.
He
had
,
I
knew
,
been
very
genuinely
and
devotedly
*NL*
attached
to
his
father
;
and
to
lose
him
,
and
at
such
a
time
,
was
a
*NL*
bitter
blow
to
him
.
With
me
he
was
warm
as
ever
,
and
to
Van
Helsing
he
*NL*
was
sweetly
courteous
;
but
I
could
not
help
seeing
that
there
was
some
*NL*
constraint
with
him
.
The
Professor
noticed
it
,
too
,
and
motioned
me
to
*NL*
bring
him
upstairs
.
I
did
so
,
and
left
him
at
the
door
of
the
room
,
as
I
*NL*
felt
he
would
like
to
be
quite
alone
with
her
,
but
he
took
my
arm
and
*NL*
led
me
in
,
saying
huskily
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
loved
her
too
,
old
fellow
;
she
told
me
all
about
it
,
and
there
was
*NL*
no
friend
had
a
closer
place
in
her
heart
than
you
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
*NL*
thank
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
her
.
I
ca
n't
think
yet
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
suddenly
broke
down
,
and
threw
his
arms
round
my
shoulders
and
*NL*
laid
his
head
on
my
breast
,
crying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Jack
!
Jack
!
What
shall
I
do
!
The
whole
of
life
seems
gone
from
me
*NL*
all
at
once
,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
wide
world
for
me
to
live
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
comforted
him
as
well
as
I
could
.
In
such
cases
men
do
not
need
much
*NL*
expression
.
A
grip
of
the
hand
,
the
tightening
of
an
arm
over
the
*NL*
shoulder
,
a
sob
in
unison
,
are
expressions
of
sympathy
dear
to
a
man
's
*NL*
heart
.
I
stood
still
and
silent
till
his
sobs
died
away
,
and
then
I
said
*NL*
softly
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
look
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Together
we
moved
over
to
the
bed
,
and
I
lifted
the
lawn
from
her
face
.
*NL*
God
!
how
beautiful
she
was
.
Every
hour
seemed
to
be
enhancing
her
*NL*
loveliness
.
It
frightened
and
amazed
me
somewhat
;
and
as
for
Arthur
,
he
*NL*
fell
a-trembling
,
and
finally
was
shaken
with
doubt
as
with
an
ague
.
At
*NL*
last
,
after
a
long
pause
,
he
said
to
me
in
a
faint
whisper
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jack
,
is
she
really
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
assured
him
sadly
that
it
was
so
,
and
went
on
to
suggest
--
for
I
felt
*NL*
that
such
a
horrible
doubt
should
not
have
life
for
a
moment
longer
than
*NL*
I
could
help
--
that
it
often
happened
that
after
death
faces
became
*NL*
softened
and
even
resolved
into
their
youthful
beauty
;
that
this
was
*NL*
especially
so
when
death
had
been
preceded
by
any
acute
or
prolonged
*NL*
suffering
.
It
seemed
to
quite
do
away
with
any
doubt
,
and
,
after
*NL*
kneeling
beside
the
couch
for
a
while
and
looking
at
her
lovingly
and
*NL*
long
,
he
turned
aside
.
I
told
him
that
that
must
be
good-bye
,
as
the
*NL*
coffin
had
to
be
prepared
;
so
he
went
back
and
took
her
dead
hand
in
his
*NL*
and
kissed
it
,
and
bent
over
and
kissed
her
forehead
.
He
came
away
,
*NL*
fondly
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
at
her
as
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
him
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
told
Van
Helsing
that
he
had
said
*NL*
good-bye
;
so
the
latter
went
to
the
kitchen
to
tell
the
undertaker
's
men
*NL*
to
proceed
with
the
preparations
and
to
screw
up
the
coffin
.
When
he
*NL*
came
out
of
the
room
again
I
told
him
of
Arthur
's
question
,
and
he
*NL*
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
surprised
.
Just
now
I
doubted
for
a
moment
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
dined
together
,
and
I
could
see
that
poor
Art
was
trying
to
make
*NL*
the
best
of
things
.
Van
Helsing
had
been
silent
all
dinner-time
;
but
*NL*
when
we
had
lit
our
cigars
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
--
''
;
but
Arthur
interrupted
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
not
that
,
for
God
's
sake
!
not
yet
at
any
rate
.
Forgive
me
,
sir
:
*NL*
I
did
not
mean
to
speak
offensively
;
it
is
only
because
my
loss
is
so
*NL*
recent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Professor
answered
very
sweetly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
used
that
name
because
I
was
in
doubt
.
I
must
not
call
you
*NL*
`
Mr.
,
'
and
I
have
grown
to
love
you
--
yes
,
my
dear
boy
,
to
love
you
--
as
*NL*
Arthur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
held
out
his
hand
,
and
took
the
old
man
's
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
me
what
you
will
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
hope
I
may
always
have
the
title
of
*NL*
a
friend
.
And
let
me
say
that
I
am
at
a
loss
for
words
to
thank
you
for
*NL*
your
goodness
to
my
poor
dear
.
''
He
paused
a
moment
,
and
went
on
:
``
I
know
*NL*
that
she
understood
your
goodness
even
better
than
I
do
;
and
if
I
was
*NL*
rude
or
in
any
way
wanting
at
that
time
you
acted
so
--
you
remember
''
--
the
*NL*
Professor
nodded
--
``
you
must
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
with
a
grave
kindness
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
was
hard
for
you
to
quite
trust
me
then
,
for
to
trust
such
*NL*
violence
needs
to
understand
;
and
I
take
it
that
you
do
not
--
that
you
*NL*
can
not
--
trust
me
now
,
for
you
do
not
yet
understand
.
And
there
may
be
*NL*
more
times
when
I
shall
want
you
to
trust
when
you
can
not
--
and
may
*NL*
not
--
and
must
not
yet
understand
.
But
the
time
will
come
when
your
trust
*NL*
shall
be
whole
and
complete
in
me
,
and
when
you
shall
understand
as
*NL*
though
the
sunlight
himself
shone
through
.
Then
you
shall
bless
me
from
*NL*
first
to
last
for
your
own
sake
,
and
for
the
sake
of
others
and
for
her
*NL*
dear
sake
to
whom
I
swore
to
protect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
indeed
,
indeed
,
sir
,
''
said
Arthur
warmly
,
``
I
shall
in
all
ways
*NL*
trust
you
.
I
know
and
believe
you
have
a
very
noble
heart
,
and
you
are
*NL*
Jack
's
friend
,
and
you
were
hers
.
You
shall
do
what
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Professor
cleared
his
throat
a
couple
of
times
,
as
though
about
to
*NL*
speak
,
and
finally
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
you

You

Mrs.
Westenra
left
you
all
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

poor

I
never

*NL*
``
And
as
it
is

yours

you
have
a
right

I
*NL*
want
you
to
give
me
permission
to
read
all
Miss
Lucy
's
papers
and
*NL*
letters
.
Believe
me
,
it
is
no
idle
curiosity

I
have
a
motive
of
which
,
*NL*
be
sure
,
she
would
have
approved
.
I
have
them
all
here
.
I
took
them
*NL*
before
we
knew
that
all
was
yours
,
so
that
no
strange
hand
might
touch
*NL*
them
--
no
strange
eye

into
her
soul

I
shall
keep

them

if
I
may
;
even
you
may
not
see
them
yet
,
but
I
shall
keep
them
*NL*
safe
.
No
word
shall
be
lost
;
and
in
the
good
time
I
shall
give
them
back
*NL*
to
you
.
It
's
a
hard
thing
I
ask
,
but
you
will
do
it
,
will
you
not
,
for
*NL*
Lucy
's
sake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
spoke
out
heartily
,
like
his
old
self
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
you
may
do
what
you
will
.
I
feel
that
in
saying
this
I
*NL*
am
doing
what
my
dear
one
would
have
approved

I
shall
not
trouble
you
*NL*
with
questions
till
the
time
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
Professor
stood
up
as
he
said
solemnly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
right
.
There
will
be
pain
for
us
all
;
but
it
will
not
be
*NL*
all
pain
,
nor
will
this
pain
be
the
last
.
We
and
you
too
--
you
most
of
*NL*
all
,
my
dear
boy
--
will
have
to
pass
through
the
bitter
water
before
we
*NL*
reach
the
sweet
.
But
we
must
be
brave
of
heart
and
unselfish
,
and
do
our
*NL*
duty
,

all
will
be
well

I
slept
on
a
sofa
in
Arthur
's
room
that
night
.
Van
Helsing
did
not
go
to
*NL*
bed
at
all
.
He
went
to
and
fro
,
as
if
patrolling
the
house
,
and
was
*NL*
never
out
of
sight
of
the
room
where
Lucy
lay
in
her
coffin
,
strewn
with
*NL*
the
wild
garlic
flowers
,
which
sent
,
through
the
odour
of
lily

*NL*
a
heavy

overpowering

In
the
train
to
Exeter
.
Jonathan
sleeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
only
yesterday
that
the
last
entry
was
made
,
and
yet
how
much
*NL*
between
then
,
in
Whitby
and
all
the
world
before
me
,
Jonathan
away
and
*NL*
no
news
of
him
;
and
now
,
married
to
Jonathan
,
Jonathan
a
solicitor
,
a
*NL*
partner
,
rich
,
master
of
his
business
,
Mr.
Hawkins
dead
and
buried
,
and
*NL*
Jonathan
with
another
attack
that
may
harm
him
.
Some
day
he
may
ask
me
*NL*
about
it
.
Down
it
all
goes
.
I
am
rusty
in
my
shorthand
--
see
what
*NL*
unexpected
prosperity
does
for
us
--
so
it
may
be
as
well
to
freshen
it
up
*NL*
again
with
an
exercise
anyhow
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
service
was
very
simple
and
very
solemn
.
There
were
only
ourselves
*NL*
and
the
servants
there
,
one
or
two
old
friends
of
his
from
Exeter
,
his
*NL*
London
agent
,
and
a
gentleman
representing
Sir
John
Paxton
,
the
*NL*
President
of
the
Incorporated
Law
Society
.
Jonathan
and
I
stood
hand
in
*NL*
hand
,
and
we
felt
that
our
best
and
dearest
friend
was
gone
from
us
...
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
back
to
town
quietly
,
taking
a
`
bus
to
Hyde
Park
Corner
.
*NL*
Jonathan
thought
it
would
interest
me
to
go
into
the
Row
for
a
while
,
so
*NL*
we
sat
down
;
but
there
were
very
few
people
there
,
and
it
was
*NL*
sad-looking
and
desolate
to
see
so
many
empty
chairs
.
It
made
us
think
*NL*
of
the
empty
chair
at
home
;
so
we
got
up
and
walked
down
Piccadilly
.
*NL*
Jonathan
was
holding
me
by
the
arm
,
the
way
he
used
to
in
old
days
*NL*
before
I
went
to
school
.
I
felt
it
very
improper
,
for
you
ca
n't
go
on
*NL*
for
some
years
teaching
etiquette
and
decorum
to
other
girls
without
the
*NL*
pedantry
of
it
biting
into
yourself
a
bit
;
but
it
was
Jonathan
,
and
he
*NL*
was
my
husband
,
and
we
did
n't
know
anybody
who
saw
us
--
and
we
did
n't
*NL*
care
if
they
did
--
so
on
we
walked
.
I
was
looking
at
a
very
beautiful
*NL*
girl
,
in
a
big
cart-wheel
hat
,
sitting
in
a
victoria
outside
Guiliano
's
,
*NL*
when
I
felt
Jonathan
clutch
my
arm
so
tight
that
he
hurt
me
,
and
he
said
*NL*
under
his
breath
:
``
My
God
!
''
I
am
always
anxious
about
Jonathan
,
for
I
*NL*
fear
that
some
nervous
fit
may
upset
him
again
;
so
I
turned
to
him
*NL*
quickly
,
and
asked
him
what
it
was
that
disturbed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
pale
,
and
his
eyes
seemed
bulging
out
as
,
half
in
terror
and
*NL*
half
in
amazement
,
he
gazed
at
a
tall
,
thin
man
,
with
a
beaky
nose
and
*NL*
black
moustache
and
pointed
beard
,
who
was
also
observing
the
pretty
*NL*
girl
.
He
was
looking
at
her
so
hard
that
he
did
not
see
either
of
us
,
*NL*
and
so
I
had
a
good
view
of
him
.
His
face
was
not
a
good
face
;
it
was
*NL*
hard
,
and
cruel
,
and
sensual
,
and
his
big
white
teeth
,
that
looked
all
*NL*
the
whiter
because
his
lips
were
so
red
,
were
pointed
like
an
animal
's
.
*NL*
Jonathan
kept
staring
at
him
,
till
I
was
afraid
he
would
notice
.
I
*NL*
feared
he
might
take
it
ill
,
he
looked
so
fierce
and
nasty
.
I
asked
*NL*
Jonathan
why
he
was
disturbed
,
and
he
answered
,
evidently
thinking
that
*NL*
I
knew
as
much
about
it
as
he
did
:
``
Do
you
see
who
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
,
''
I
said
;
``
I
do
n't
know
him
;
who
is
it
?
''
His
answer
seemed
to
*NL*
shock
and
thrill
me
,
for
it
was
said
as
if
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
*NL*
to
me
,
Mina
,
to
whom
he
was
speaking
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
man
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
dear
was
evidently
terrified
at
something
--
very
greatly
*NL*
terrified
;
I
do
believe
that
if
he
had
not
had
me
to
lean
on
and
to
*NL*
support
him
he
would
have
sunk
down
.
He
kept
staring
;
a
man
came
out
of
*NL*
the
shop
with
a
small
parcel
,
and
gave
it
to
the
lady
,
who
then
drove
*NL*
off
.
The
dark
man
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
,
and
when
the
carriage
*NL*
moved
up
Piccadilly
he
followed
in
the
same
direction
,
and
hailed
a
*NL*
hansom
.
Jonathan
kept
looking
after
him
,
and
said
,
as
if
to
himself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
is
the
Count
,
but
he
has
grown
young
.
My
God
,
if
this
be
*NL*
so
!
Oh
,
my
God
!
my
God
!
If
I
only
knew
!
if
I
only
knew
!
''
He
was
*NL*
distressing
himself
so
much
that
I
feared
to
keep
his
mind
on
the
*NL*
subject
by
asking
him
any
questions
,
so
I
remained
silent
.
I
drew
him
*NL*
away
quietly
,
and
he
,
holding
my
arm
,
came
easily
.
We
walked
a
little
*NL*
further
,
and
then
went
in
and
sat
for
a
while
in
the
Green
Park
.
It
was
*NL*
a
hot
day
for
autumn
,
and
there
was
a
comfortable
seat
in
a
shady
place
.
*NL*
After
a
few
minutes
'
staring
at
nothing
,
Jonathan
's
eyes
closed
,
and
he
*NL*
went
quietly
into
a
sleep
,
with
his
head
on
my
shoulder
.
I
thought
it
*NL*
was
the
best
thing
for
him
,
so
did
not
disturb
him
.
In
about
twenty
*NL*
minutes
he
woke
up
,
and
said
to
me
quite
cheerfully
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mina
,
have
I
been
asleep
!
Oh
,
do
forgive
me
for
being
so
rude
.
*NL*
Come
,
and
we
'll
have
a
cup
of
tea
somewhere
.
''
He
had
evidently
forgotten
*NL*
all
about
the
dark
stranger
,
as
in
his
illness
he
had
forgotten
all
that
*NL*
this
episode
had
reminded
him
of
.
I
do
n't
like
this
lapsing
into
*NL*
forgetfulness
;
it
may
make
or
continue
some
injury
to
the
brain
.
I
must
*NL*
not
ask
him
,
for
fear
I
shall
do
more
harm
than
good
;
but
I
must
somehow
*NL*
learn
the
facts
of
his
journey
abroad
.
The
time
is
come
,
I
fear
,
when
I
*NL*
must
open
that
parcel
,
and
know
what
is
written
.
Oh
,
Jonathan
,
you
will
,
*NL*
I
know
,
forgive
me
if
I
do
wrong
,
but
it
is
for
your
own
dear
sake
.

Jonathan
still
pale
and
dizzy
under
a
slight
*NL*
relapse
of
his
malady
;
and
now
a
telegram
from
Van
Helsing

whoever
he

may
be

It
is
all
over

Arthur
has
gone
back
to
Ring
,
and
has
*NL*
taken
Quincey
Morris
with
him
.
What
a
fine
fellow
is
Quincey
!
I
believe
*NL*
in
my
heart
of
hearts
that
he
suffered
as
much
about
Lucy
's
death
as
any
*NL*
of
us
;
but
he
bore
himself
through
it
like
a
moral
Viking
.
If
America
*NL*
can
go
on
breeding
men
like
that
,
she
will
be
a
power
in
the
world
*NL*
indeed

Van
Helsing
is
lying
down
,
having
a
rest
preparatory
to
his
*NL*
journey
.
He
goes
over
to
Amsterdam
to-night
,
but
says
he
returns
*NL*
to-morrow
night
;
that
he
only
wants
to
make
some
arrangements
which
can
*NL*
only
be
made
personally
.
He
is
to
stop
with
me
then
,
if
he
can
;
he
says
*NL*
he
has
work
to
do
in
London
which
may
take
him
some
time
.
Poor
old
*NL*
fellow
!
I
fear
that
the
strain
of
the
past
week
has
broken
down
even
his
*NL*
iron
strength
.
All
the
time
of
the
burial
he
was
,
I
could
see
,
putting
*NL*
some
terrible
restraint
on
himself
.
When
it
was
all
over
,
we
were
*NL*
standing
beside
Arthur
,
who
,
poor
fellow
,
was
speaking
of
his
part
in
*NL*
the
operation
where
his
blood
had
been
transfused
to
his
Lucy
's
veins
;
I
*NL*
could
see
Van
Helsing
's
face
grow
white
and
purple
by
turns
.
Arthur
was
*NL*
saying
that
he
felt
since
then
as
if
they
two
had
been
really
married
*NL*
and
that
she
was
his
wife
in
the
sight
of
God
.
None
of
us
said
a
word
of
*NL*
the
other
operations
,
and
none
of
us
ever
shall
.
Arthur
and
Quincey
went
*NL*
away
together
to
the
station
,
and
Van
Helsing
and
I
came
on
here
.
The
*NL*
moment
we
were
alone
in
the
carriage
he
gave
way
to
a
regular
fit
of
*NL*
hysterics
.
He
has
denied
to
me
since
that
it
was
hysterics
,
and
insisted
*NL*
that
it
was
only
his
sense
of
humour
asserting
itself
under
very
*NL*
terrible
conditions
.
He
laughed
till
he
cried
,
and
I
had
to
draw
down
*NL*
the
blinds
lest
any
one
should
see
us
and
misjudge
;
and
then
he
cried
,
*NL*
till
he
laughed
again
;
and
laughed
and
cried
together
,
just
as
a
woman
*NL*
does
.
I
tried
to
be
stern
with
him
,
as
one
is
to
a
woman
under
the
*NL*
circumstances
;
but
it
had
no
effect
.
Men
and
women
are
so
different
in
*NL*
manifestations
of
nervous
strength
or
weakness
!
Then
when
his
face
grew
*NL*
grave
and
stern
again
I
asked
him
why
his
mirth
,
and
why
at
such
a
time
.
*NL*
His
reply
was
in
a
way
characteristic
of
him
,
for
it
was
logical
and
*NL*
forceful
and
mysterious
.
He
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
n't
comprehend
,
friend
John
.
Do
not
think
that
I
am
not
sad
,
*NL*
though
I
laugh
.
See
,
I
have
cried
even
when
the
laugh
did
choke
me
.
But
*NL*
no
more
think
that
I
am
all
sorry
when
I
cry
,
for
the
laugh
he
come
*NL*
just
the
same
.
Keep
it
always
with
you
that
laughter
who
knock
at
your
*NL*
door
and
say
,
`
May
I
come
in
?
'
is
not
the
true
laughter
.
No
!
he
is
a
*NL*
king
,
and
he
come
when
and
how
he
like
.
He
ask
no
person
;
he
choose
no
*NL*
time
of
suitability
.
He
say
,
'
I
am
here
.
'
Behold
,
in
example
I
grieve
my
*NL*
heart
out
for
that
so
sweet
young
girl
;
I
give
my
blood
for
her
,
though
*NL*
I
am
old
and
worn
;
I
give
my
time
,
my
skill
,
my
sleep
;
I
let
my
other
*NL*
sufferers
want
that
so
she
may
have
all
.
And
yet
I
can
laugh
at
her
very
*NL*
grave
--
laugh
when
the
clay
from
the
spade
of
the
sexton
drop
upon
her
*NL*
coffin
and
say
`
Thud
!
thud
!
'
to
my
heart
,
till
it
send
back
the
blood
*NL*
from
my
cheek
.
My
heart
bleed
for
that
poor
boy
--
that
dear
boy
,
so
of
*NL*
the
age
of
mine
own
boy
had
I
been
so
blessed
that
he
live
,
and
with
his
*NL*
hair
and
eyes
the
same
.
There
,
you
know
now
why
I
love
him
so
.
And
yet
*NL*
when
he
say
things
that
touch
my
husband-heart
to
the
quick
,
and
make
my
*NL*
father-heart
yearn
to
him
as
to
no
other
man
--
not
even
to
you
,
friend
*NL*
John
,
for
we
are
more
level
in
experiences
than
father
and
son
--
yet
even
*NL*
at
such
moment
King
Laugh
he
come
to
me
and
shout
and
bellow
in
my
ear
,
*NL*
`
Here
I
am
!
here
I
am
!
'
till
the
blood
come
dance
back
and
bring
some
of
*NL*
the
sunshine
that
he
carry
with
him
to
my
cheek
.
Oh
,
friend
John
,
it
is
*NL*
a
strange
world
,
a
sad
world
,
a
world
full
of
miseries
,
and
woes
,
and
*NL*
troubles
;
and
yet
when
King
Laugh
come
he
make
them
all
dance
to
the
*NL*
tune
he
play
.
Bleeding
hearts
,
and
dry
bones
of
the
churchyard
,
and
*NL*
tears
that
burn
as
they
fall
--
all
dance
together
to
the
music
that
he
*NL*
make
with
that
smileless
mouth
of
him
.
And
believe
me
,
friend
John
,
that
*NL*
he
is
good
to
come
,
and
kind
.
Ah
,
we
men
and
women
are
like
ropes
drawn
*NL*
tight
with
strain
that
pull
us
different
ways
.
Then
tears
come
;
and
,
*NL*
like
the
rain
on
the
ropes
,
they
brace
us
up
,
until
perhaps
the
strain
*NL*
become
too
great
,
and
we
break
.
But
King
Laugh
he
come
like
the
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
he
ease
off
the
strain
again
;
and
we
bear
to
go
on
with
*NL*
our
labour
,
what
it
may
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
like
to
wound
him
by
pretending
not
to
see
his
idea
;
but
,
as
I
*NL*
did
not
yet
understand
the
cause
of
his
laughter
,
I
asked
him
.
As
he
*NL*
answered
me
his
face
grew
stern
,
and
he
said
in
quite
a
different
*NL*
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
was
the
grim
irony
of
it
all
--
this
so
lovely
lady
garlanded
with
*NL*
flowers
,
that
looked
so
fair
as
life
,
till
one
by
one
we
wondered
if
she
*NL*
were
truly
dead
;
she
laid
in
that
so
fine
marble
house
in
that
lonely
*NL*
churchyard
,
where
rest
so
many
of
her
kin
,
laid
there
with
the
mother
*NL*
who
loved
her
,
and
whom
she
loved
;
and
that
sacred
bell
going
`
Toll
!
*NL*
toll
!
toll
!
'
so
sad
and
slow
;
and
those
holy
men
,
with
the
white
*NL*
garments
of
the
angel
,
pretending
to
read
books
,
and
yet
all
the
time
*NL*
their
eyes
never
on
the
page
;
and
all
of
us
with
the
bowed
head
.
And
all
*NL*
for
what
?
She
is
dead
;
so
!
Is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
the
life
of
me
,
Professor
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
ca
n't
see
anything
to
*NL*
laugh
at
in
all
that
.
Why
,
your
explanation
makes
it
a
harder
puzzle
*NL*
than
before
.
But
even
if
the
burial
service
was
comic
,
what
about
poor
*NL*
Art
and
his
trouble
?
Why
,
his
heart
was
simply
breaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
.
Said
he
not
that
the
transfusion
of
his
blood
to
her
veins
had
*NL*
made
her
truly
his
bride
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it
was
a
sweet
and
comforting
idea
for
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so

But
there
was
a
difficulty
,
friend
John

If
so
that
,
then
*NL*
what
about
the
others

Ho

ho

Then
this
so
sweet
maid
is
a
polyandrist

me

with
my
poor

dead

alive

no

even
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
where
the
joke
comes
in
there
either
!
''
I
said
;
and
I
did
*NL*
not
feel
particularly
pleased
with
him
for
saying
such
things
.
He
laid
*NL*
his
hand
on
my
arm
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
John
,
forgive
me
if
I

I
showed
not
my
feeling
to

*NL*
when
it
would
wound
,
but
only
to
you
,
my
old
friend

whom
I
can
trust

*NL*
If
you
could
have
looked
into
my
very
heart

when
I
want
to
laugh
;
*NL*
if
you

up

far
away
from

and
for
a

maybe
you
would
*NL*
perhaps
pity
me
the
most
of
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
touched
by
the
tenderness
of
his
tone
,
and
asked
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

*NL*
*NL*
And
now
we
are
all
scattered
;

for

a
long
day
loneliness
will
*NL*
sit
over
our
roofs
with
brooding
wings
.
Lucy
lies
in
the
tomb
of
her
*NL*
kin
,
a
lordly
death-house
in
a
lonely
churchyard
,
away
from
teeming
*NL*
London

where
the

is
fresh

rises
over

A
HAMPSTEAD
MYSTERY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbourhood
of
Hampstead
is
just
at
present
exercised
with
a
*NL*
series
of
events
which
seem
to
run
on
lines
parallel
to
those
of
what
*NL*
was
known
to
the
writers
of
headlines
as
``
The
Kensington
Horror
,
''
or
*NL*
``
The
Stabbing
Woman
,
''
or
``
The
Woman
in
Black
.
''
During
the
past
two
or
*NL*
three
days
several
cases
have
occurred
of
young
children
straying
from
*NL*
home
or
neglecting
to
return
from
their
playing
on
the
Heath
.
In
all
*NL*
these
cases
the
children
were
too
young
to
give
any
properly
*NL*
intelligible
account
of
themselves
,
but
the
consensus
of
their
excuses
*NL*
is
that
they
had
been
with
a
``
bloofer
lady
.
''
It
has
always
been
late
in
*NL*
the
evening
when
they
have
been
missed
,
and
on
two
occasions
the
*NL*
children
have
not
been
found
until
early
in
the
following
morning
.
It
is
*NL*
generally
supposed
in
the
neighbourhood
that
,
as
the
first
child
missed
*NL*
gave
as
his
reason
for
being
away
that
a
``
bloofer
lady
''
had
asked
him
to
*NL*
come
for
a
walk
,
the
others
had
picked
up
the
phrase
and
used
it
as
*NL*
occasion
served
.
This
is
the
more
natural
as
the
favourite
game
of
the
*NL*
little
ones
at
present
is
luring
each
other
away
by
wiles
.
A
*NL*
correspondent
writes
us
that
to
see
some
of
the
tiny
tots
pretending
to
*NL*
be
the
``
bloofer
lady
''
is
supremely
funny
.
Some
of
our
caricaturists
*NL*
might
,
he
says
,
take
a
lesson
in
the
irony
of
grotesque
by
comparing
the
*NL*
reality
and
the
picture
.
It
is
only
in
accordance
with
general
*NL*
principles
of
human
nature
that
the
``
bloofer
lady
''
should
be
the
popular
*NL*
role
at
these
_
al
fresco
_
performances
.
Our
correspondent
naively
says
*NL*
that
even
Ellen
Terry
could
not
be
so
winningly
attractive
as
some
of
*NL*
these
grubby-faced
little
children
pretend
--
and
even
imagine
*NL*
themselves
--
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
,
however
,
possibly
a
serious
side
to
the
question
,
for
some
of
*NL*
the
children
,
indeed
all
who
have
been
missed
at
night
,
have
been
*NL*
slightly
torn
or
wounded
in
the
throat
.
The
wounds
seem
such
as
might
be
*NL*
made
by
a
rat
or
a
small
dog
,
and
although
of
not
much
importance
*NL*
individually
,
would
tend
to
show
that
whatever
animal
inflicts
them
has
*NL*
a
system
or
method
of
its
own
.
The
police
of
the
division
have
been
*NL*
instructed
to
keep
a
sharp
look-out
for
straying
children
,
especially
*NL*
when
very
young
,
in
and
around
Hampstead
Heath
,
and
for
any
stray
dog
*NL*
which
may
be
about
.

Jonathan
is
better
after
a
bad
night
.
I
am
so
glad
that
*NL*
he
has
plenty
of
work
to
do
,
for
that
keeps
his
mind
off
the
terrible
*NL*
things
;
and
oh
,
I
am
rejoiced
that
he
is
not
now
weighed
down
with
the
*NL*
responsibility
of
his
new
position
.
I
knew
he
would
be
true
to
himself
,
*NL*
and
now
how
proud
I
am
to
see
my
Jonathan
rising
to
the
height
of
his
*NL*
advancement
and
keeping
pace
in
all
ways
with
the
duties
that
come
upon
*NL*
him
.
He
will
be
away
all
day
till
late
,
for
he
said
he
could
not
lunch
*NL*
at
home
.
My
household
work
is
done
,
so
I
shall
take
his
foreign
journal
,
*NL*
and
lock
myself
up
in
my
room
and
read
it
...

--
I
had
n't
the
heart
to
write
last
night
;
that
terrible
*NL*
record
of
Jonathan
's
upset
me
so
.
Poor
dear
!
How
he
must
have
suffered
,
*NL*
whether
it
be
true
or
only
imagination
.
I
wonder
if
there
is
any
truth
*NL*
in
it
at
all
.
Did
he
get
his
brain
fever
,
and
then
write
all
those
*NL*
terrible
things
,
or
had
he
some
cause
for
it
all
?
I
suppose
I
shall
*NL*
never
know
,
for
I
dare
not
open
the
subject
to
him
...
And
yet
that
man
*NL*
we
saw
yesterday
!
He
seemed
quite
certain
of
him
...
Poor
fellow
!
I
*NL*
suppose
it
was
the
funeral
upset
him
and
sent
his
mind
back
on
some
*NL*
train
of
thought
...
He
believes
it
all
himself
.
I
remember
how
on
our
*NL*
wedding-day
he
said
:
``
Unless
some
solemn
duty
come
upon
me
to
go
back
to
*NL*
the
bitter
hours
,
asleep
or
awake
,
mad
or
sane
.
''
There
seems
to
be
*NL*
through
it
all
some
thread
of
continuity
...
That
fearful
Count
was
*NL*
coming
to
London
...
If
it
should
be
,
and
he
came
to
London
,
with
his
*NL*
teeming
millions
...
There
may
be
a
solemn
duty
;
and
if
it
come
we
must
*NL*
not
shrink
from
it
...
I
shall
be
prepared
.
I
shall
get
my
typewriter
*NL*
this
very
hour
and
begin
transcribing
.
Then
we
shall
be
ready
for
other
*NL*
eyes
if
required
.
And
if
it
be
wanted
;
then
,
perhaps
,
if
I
am
ready
,
*NL*
poor
Jonathan
may
not
be
upset
,
for
I
can
speak
for
him
and
never
let
*NL*
him
be
troubled
or
worried
with
it
at
all
.
If
ever
Jonathan
quite
gets
*NL*
over
the
nervousness
he
may
want
to
tell
me
of
it
all
,
and
I
can
ask
him
*NL*
questions
and
find
out
things
,
and
see
how
I
may
comfort
him
.

I

how

you
are
and
how
your

suffer
;
so
I

enlighten
him
not

lest
it

harm
.
Again
your
pardon

forgive

_
--
I
can
not
help
feeling
terribly
excited
as
the
time
*NL*
draws
near
for
the
visit
of
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
for
somehow
I
expect
that
*NL*
it
will
throw
some
light
upon
Jonathan
's
sad
experience
;
and
as
he
*NL*
attended
poor
dear
Lucy
in
her
last
illness
,
he
can
tell
me
all
about
*NL*
her
.
That
is
the
reason
of
his
coming
;
it
is
concerning
Lucy
and
her
*NL*
sleep-walking
,
and
not
about
Jonathan
.
Then
I
shall
never
know
the
real
*NL*
truth
now
!
How
silly
I
am
.
That
awful
journal
gets
hold
of
my
*NL*
imagination
and
tinges
everything
with
something
of
its
own
colour
.
Of
*NL*
course
it
is
about
Lucy
.
That
habit
came
back
to
the
poor
dear
,
and
that
*NL*
awful
night
on
the
cliff
must
have
made
her
ill
.
I
had
almost
forgotten
*NL*
in
my
own
affairs
how
ill
she
was
afterwards
.
She
must
have
told
him
*NL*
of
her
sleep-walking
adventure
on
the
cliff
,
and
that
I
knew
all
about
*NL*
it
;
and
now
he
wants
me
to
tell
him
what
she
knows
,
so
that
he
may
*NL*
understand
.
I
hope
I
did
right
in
not
saying
anything
of
it
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Westenra
;
I
should
never
forgive
myself
if
any
act
of
mine
,
were
it
even
*NL*
a
negative
one
,
brought
harm
on
poor
dear
Lucy
.
I
hope
,
too
,
Dr.
Van
*NL*
Helsing
will
not
blame
me
;
I
have
had
so
much
trouble
and
anxiety
of
*NL*
late
that
I
feel
I
can
not
bear
more
just
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
a
cry
does
us
all
good
at
times
--
clears
the
air
as
other
rain
*NL*
does
.
Perhaps
it
was
reading
the
journal
yesterday
that
upset
me
,
and
*NL*
then
Jonathan
went
away
this
morning
to
stay
away
from
me
a
whole
day
*NL*
and
night
,
the
first
time
we
have
been
parted
since
our
marriage
.
I
do
*NL*
hope
the
dear
fellow
will
take
care
of
himself
,
and
that
nothing
will
*NL*
occur
to
upset
him
.
It
is
two
o'clock
,
and
the
doctor
will
be
here
soon
*NL*
now
.
I
shall
say
nothing
of
Jonathan
's
journal
unless
he
asks
me
.
I
am
*NL*
so
glad
I
have
type-written
out
my
own
journal
,
so
that
,
in
case
he
asks
*NL*
about
Lucy
,
I
can
hand
it
to
him
;
it
will
save
much
questioning
.
*NL*
*NL*
*

*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Later
.
_
--
He
has
come
and
gone
.
Oh
,
what
a
strange
meeting
,
and
how
it
*NL*
all
makes
my
head
whirl
round
!
I
feel
like
one
in
a
dream
.
Can
it
be
all
*NL*
possible
,
or
even
a
part
of
it
?
If
I
had
not
read
Jonathan
's
journal
*NL*
first
,
I
should
never
have
accepted
even
a
possibility
.
Poor
,
poor
,
dear
*NL*
Jonathan
!
How
he
must
have
suffered
.
Please
the
good
God
,
all
this
may
*NL*
not
upset
him
again
.
I
shall
try
to
save
him
from
it
;
but
it
may
be
even
*NL*
a
consolation
and
a
help
to
him
--
terrible
though
it
be
and
awful
in
its
*NL*
consequences
--
to
know
for
certain
that
his
eyes
and
ears
and
brain
did
*NL*
not
deceive
him
,
and
that
it
is
all
true
.
It
may
be
that
it
is
the
doubt
*NL*
which
haunts
him
;
that
when
the
doubt
is
removed
,
no
matter
*NL*
which
--
waking
or
dreaming
--
may
prove
the
truth
,
he
will
be
more
*NL*
satisfied
and
better
able
to
bear
the
shock
.
Dr.
Van
Helsing
must
be
a
*NL*
good
man
as
well
as
a
clever
one
if
he
is
Arthur
's
friend
and
Dr.
*NL*
Seward
's
,
and
if
they
brought
him
all
the
way
from
Holland
to
look
after
*NL*
Lucy
.
I
feel
from
having
seen
him
that
he
_
is
_
good
and
kind
and
of
a
*NL*
noble
nature
.
When
he
comes
to-morrow
I
shall
ask
him
about
Jonathan
;
*NL*
and
then
,
please
God
,
all
this
sorrow
and
anxiety
may
lead
to
a
good
*NL*
end
.
I
used
to
think
I
would
like
to
practise
interviewing
;
Jonathan
's
*NL*
friend
on
``
The
Exeter
News
''
told
him
that
memory
was
everything
in
such
*NL*
work
--
that
you
must
be
able
to
put
down
exactly
almost
every
word
*NL*
spoken
,
even
if
you
had
to
refine
some
of
it
afterwards
.
Here
was
a
rare
*NL*
interview
;
I
shall
try
to
record
it
_
verbatim
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
half-past
two
o'clock
when
the
knock
came
.
I
took
my
courage
_
a
*NL*
deux
mains
_
and
waited
.
In
a
few
minutes
Mary
opened
the
door
,
and
*NL*
announced
``
Dr.
Van
Helsing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
and
bowed
,
and
he
came
towards
me
;
a
man
of
medium
weight
,
*NL*
strongly
built
,
with
his
shoulders
set
back
over
a
broad
,
deep
chest
and
*NL*
a
neck
well
balanced
on
the
trunk
as
the
head
is
on
the
neck
.
The
poise
*NL*
of
the
head
strikes
one
at
once
as
indicative
of
thought
and
power
;
the
*NL*
head
is
noble
,
well-sized
,
broad
,
and
large
behind
the
ears
.
The
face
,
*NL*
clean-shaven
,
shows
a
hard
,
square
chin
,
a
large
,
resolute
,
mobile
*NL*
mouth
,
a
good-sized
nose
,
rather
straight
,
but
with
quick
,
sensitive
*NL*
nostrils
,
that
seem
to
broaden
as
the
big
,
bushy
brows
come
down
and
the
*NL*
mouth
tightens
.
The
forehead
is
broad
and
fine
,
rising
at
first
almost
*NL*
straight
and
then
sloping
back
above
two
bumps
or
ridges
wide
apart
;
*NL*
such
a
forehead
that
the
reddish
hair
can
not
possibly
tumble
over
it
,
*NL*
but
falls
naturally
back
and
to
the
sides
.
Big
,
dark
blue
eyes
are
set
*NL*
widely
apart
,
and
are
quick
and
tender
or
stern
with
the
man
's
moods
.
He
*NL*
said
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Harker
,
is
it
not
?
''
I
bowed
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
Miss
Mina
Murray
?
''
Again
I
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Mina
Murray
that
I
came
to
see
that
was
friend
of
that
poor
dear
*NL*
child
Lucy
Westenra
.
Madam
Mina
,
it
is
on
account
of
the
dead
I
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
I
said
,
``
you
could
have
no
better
claim
on
me
than
that
you
were
*NL*
a
friend
and
helper
of
Lucy
Westenra
.
''
And
I
held
out
my
hand
.
He
took
*NL*
it
and
said
tenderly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Madam
Mina
,
I
knew
that
the
friend
of
that
poor
lily
girl
must
be
*NL*
good
,
but
I
had
yet
to
learn
--
''
He
finished
his
speech
with
a
courtly
*NL*
bow
.
I
asked
him
what
it
was
that
he
wanted
to
see
me
about
,
so
he
at
*NL*
once
began
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
read
your
letters
to
Miss
Lucy
.
Forgive
me
,
but
I
had
to
begin
*NL*
to
inquire
somewhere
,
and
there
was
none
to
ask
.
I
know
that
you
were
*NL*
with
her
at
Whitby
.
She
sometimes
kept
a
diary
--
you
need
not
look
*NL*
surprised
,
Madam
Mina
;
it
was
begun
after
you
had
left
,
and
was
in
*NL*
imitation
of
you
--
and
in
that
diary
she
traces
by
inference
certain
*NL*
things
to
a
sleep-walking
in
which
she
puts
down
that
you
saved
her
.
In
*NL*
great
perplexity
then
I
come
to
you
,
and
ask
you
out
of
your
so
much
*NL*
kindness
to
tell
me
all
of
it
that
you
can
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
,
I
think
,
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
you
have
good
memory
for
facts
,
for
details
?
It
is
not
always
*NL*
so
with
young
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
doctor
,
but
I
wrote
it
all
down
at
the
time
.
I
can
show
it
to
you
*NL*
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Madam
Mina
,
I
will
be
grateful
;
you
will
do
me
much
favour
.
''
I
*NL*
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
mystifying
him
a
bit
--
I
suppose
it
is
*NL*
some
of
the
taste
of
the
original
apple
that
remains
still
in
our
*NL*
mouths
--
so
I
handed
him
the
shorthand
diary
.
He
took
it
with
a
grateful
*NL*
bow
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
read
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wish
,
''
I
answered
as
demurely
as
I
could
.
He
opened
it
,
and
for
*NL*
an
instant
his
face
fell
.
Then
he
stood
up
and
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
so
clever
woman
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
knew
long
that
Mr.
Jonathan
was
a
*NL*
man
of
much
thankfulness
;
but
see
,
his
wife
have
all
the
good
things
.
*NL*
And
will
you
not
so
much
honour
me
and
so
help
me
as
to
read
it
for
me
?
*NL*
Alas
!
I
know
not
the
shorthand
.
''
By
this
time
my
little
joke
was
over
,
*NL*
and
I
was
almost
ashamed
;
so
I
took
the
typewritten
copy
from
my
*NL*
workbasket
and
handed
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
''
I
said
:
``
I
could
not
help
it
;
but
I
had
been
thinking
that
*NL*
it
was
of
dear
Lucy
that
you
wished
to
ask
,
and
so
that
you
might
not
*NL*
have
time
to
wait
--
not
on
my
account
,
but
because
I
know
your
time
must
*NL*
be
precious
--
I
have
written
it
out
on
the
typewriter
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
and
his
eyes
glistened
.
``
You
are
so
good
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
may
*NL*
I
read
it
now
?
I
may
want
to
ask
you
some
things
when
I
have
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
''
I
said
,
``
read
it
over
whilst
I
order
lunch
;
and
then
you
*NL*
can
ask
me
questions
whilst
we
eat
.
''
He
bowed
and
settled
himself
in
a
*NL*
chair
with
his
back
to
the
light
,
and
became
absorbed
in
the
papers
,
*NL*
whilst
I
went
to
see
after
lunch
chiefly
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
*NL*
disturbed
.
When
I
came
back
,
I
found
him
walking
hurriedly
up
and
down
*NL*
the
room
,
his
face
all
ablaze
with
excitement
.
He
rushed
up
to
me
and
*NL*
took
me
by
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Madam
Mina
,
''
he
said
,
``
how
can
I
say
what
I
owe
to
you
?
This
paper
*NL*
is
as
sunshine
.
It
opens
the
gate
to
me
.
I
am
daze
,
I
am
dazzle
,
with
so
*NL*
much
light
,
and
yet
clouds
roll
in
behind
the
light
every
time
.
But
that
*NL*
you
do
not
,
can
not
,
comprehend
.
Oh
,
but
I
am
grateful
to
you
,
you
so
*NL*
clever
woman

Madam
''
--
he
said
this
very
solemnly
--
``
if
ever
Abraham
Van
*NL*
Helsing

do
anything
for
you
or
yours
,
I
trust
you
will

*NL*
It
will
be
pleasure
and
delight
if
I
may
serve
you
as
a
friend
;
as
a
*NL*
friend

but
all
I
have
ever
learned

all
I

shall
be

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

you
praise
me
too
much

do
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

am
old

I
saw
here
an
opening
to
ask
him
about
*NL*
Jonathan
,
so
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
almost
recovered

upset

He
interrupted
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes

I
know
,
I
know

I
have
read
your
last
two

I
went
*NL*
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

upset
him
,
for
when
we
were
in
town
on
Thursday
last
he
*NL*
had
a
sort
of
shock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
shock
,
and
after
brain
fever
so
soon
!
That
was
not
good
.
What
kind
of
*NL*
a
shock
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thought
he
saw
some
one
who
recalled
something
terrible
,
something
*NL*
which
led
to
his
brain
fever
.
''
And
here
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
*NL*
overwhelm
me
in
a
rush
.
The
pity
for
Jonathan
,
the
horror
which
he
*NL*
experienced
,
the
whole
fearful
mystery
of
his
diary
,
and
the
fear
that
*NL*
has
been
brooding
over
me
ever
since
,
all
came
in
a
tumult
.
I
suppose
I
*NL*
was
hysterical
,
for
I
threw
myself
on
my
knees
and
held
up
my
hands
to
*NL*
him
,
and
implored
him
to
make
my
husband
well
again
.
He
took
my
hands
*NL*
and
raised
me
up
,
and
made
me
sit
on
the
sofa
,
and
sat
by
me
;
he
held
my
*NL*
hand
in
his
,
and
said
to
me
with
,
oh
,
such
infinite
sweetness
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
life
is
a
barren
and
lonely
one
,
and
so
full
of
work
that
I
have
not
*NL*
had
much
time
for
friendships
;
but
since
I
have
been
summoned
to
here
by
*NL*
my
friend
John
Seward
I
have
known
so
many
good
people
and
seen
such
*NL*
nobility
that
I
feel
more
than
ever
--
and
it
has
grown
with
my
advancing
*NL*
years
--
the
loneliness
of
my
life
.
Believe
,
me
,
then
,
that
I
come
here
*NL*
full
of
respect
for
you
,
and
you
have
given
me
hope
--
hope
,
not
in
what
I
*NL*
am
seeking
of
,
but
that
there
are
good
women
still
left
to
make
life
*NL*
happy
--
good
women
,
whose
lives
and
whose
truths
may
make
good
lesson
for
*NL*
the
children
that
are
to
be
.
I
am
glad
,
glad
,
that
I
may
here
be
of
some
*NL*
use
to
you
;
for
if
your
husband
suffer
,
he
suffer
within
the
range
of
my
*NL*
study
and
experience
.
I
promise
you
that
I
will
gladly
do
_
all
_
for
him
*NL*
that
I
can
--
all
to
make
his
life
strong
and
manly
,
and
your
life
a
happy
*NL*
one
.
Now
you
must
eat
.
You
are
overwrought
and
perhaps
over-anxious
.
*NL*
Husband
Jonathan
would
not
like
to
see
you
so
pale
;
and
what
he
like
not
*NL*
where
he
love
,
is
not
to
his
good
.
Therefore
for
his
sake
you
must
eat
*NL*
and
smile
.
You
have
told
me
all
about
Lucy
,
and
so
now
we
shall
not
*NL*
speak
of
it
,
lest
it
distress
.
I
shall
stay
in
Exeter
to-night
,
for
I
*NL*
want
to
think
much
over
what
you
have
told
me
,
and
when
I
have
thought
I
*NL*
will
ask
you
questions
,
if
I
may
.
And
then
,
too
,
you
will
tell
me
of
*NL*
husband
Jonathan
's
trouble
so
far
as
you
can
,
but
not
yet
.
You
must
eat
*NL*
now
;
afterwards
you
shall
tell
me
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
lunch
,
when
we
went
back
to
the
drawing-room
,
he
said
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
tell
me
all
about
him
.
''
When
it
came
to
speaking
to
this
great
*NL*
learned
man
,
I
began
to
fear
that
he
would
think
me
a
weak
fool
,
and
*NL*
Jonathan
a
madman
--
that
journal
is
all
so
strange
--
and
I
hesitated
to
go
*NL*
on
.
But
he
was
so
sweet
and
kind
,
and
he
had
promised
to
help
,
and
I
*NL*
trusted
him
,
so
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
what
I
have
to
tell
you
is
so
queer
that
you
must
not
*NL*
laugh
at
me
or
at
my
husband
.
I
have
been
since
yesterday
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
fever
of
doubt
;
you
must
be
kind
to
me
,
and
not
think
me
foolish
that
I
*NL*
have
even
half
believed
some
very
strange
things
.
''
He
reassured
me
by
*NL*
his
manner
as
well
as
his
words
when
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
if
you
only
know
how
strange
is
the
matter
regarding
which
*NL*
I
am
here
,
it
is
you
who
would
laugh
.
I
have
learned
not
to
think
little
*NL*
of
any
one
's
belief
,
no
matter
how
strange
it
be
.
I
have
tried
to
keep
*NL*
an
open
mind
;
and
it
is
not
the
ordinary
things
of
life
that
could
close
*NL*
it
,
but
the
strange
things
,
the
extraordinary
things
,
the
things
that
*NL*
make
one
doubt
if
they
be
mad
or
sane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
thank
you
,
a
thousand
times
!
You
have
taken
a
weight
off
my
*NL*
mind

If
you
will
let
me
,
I
shall
give
you
a
paper
to
read
.
It
is
long
,
*NL*
but
I
have
typewritten
it
out
.
It
will
tell
you
my
trouble
and
*NL*
Jonathan
's
.
It
is
the
copy
of
his
journal
when
abroad
,
and
all
that
*NL*
happened
.
I
dare
not
say
anything
of
it
;
you
will
read
for
yourself
and
*NL*
judge
.
And
then
when
I
see
you
,
perhaps
,
you
will
be
very
kind
and
tell
*NL*
me
what
you
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
,
''
he
said
as
I
gave
him
the
papers
;
``
I
shall
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
so
soon
as
I
can

come

see
you

I
may

*NL*
*NL*
``
Jonathan
will
be
here
at
half-past

and
you
must
come
to

*NL*
with

and
see
him
then
;
you
could
catch
the
quick
3:34
train
,
which
*NL*
will
leave
you
at
Paddington
before
eight
.
''
He
was
surprised
at
my
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
trains
off-hand
,
but
he
does
not
know
that
I
have
made
*NL*
up
all
the
trains
to
and
from
Exeter
,
so
that
I
may
help
Jonathan
in

is
in

*NL*
*NL*
So
he
took
the

with

went
away

--
I
thought
never
to
write
in
this
diary
again
,
but
the
*NL*
time
has
come
.
When
I
got
home
last
night
Mina
had
supper
ready
,
and
*NL*
when
we
had
supped
she
told
me
of
Van
Helsing
's
visit
,
and
of
her
having
*NL*
given
him
the
two
diaries
copied
out
,
and
of
how
anxious
she
has
been
*NL*
about
me
.
She
showed
me
in
the
doctor
's
letter
that
all
I
wrote
down
was
*NL*
true
.
It
seems
to
have
made
a
new
man
of
me
.
It
was
the
doubt
as
to
the
*NL*
reality
of
the
whole
thing
that
knocked
me
over
.
I
felt
impotent
,
and
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
and
distrustful
.
But
,
now
that
I
_
know
_
,
I
am
not
afraid
,
even
*NL*
of
the
Count
.
He
has
succeeded
after
all
,
then
,
in
his
design
in
getting
*NL*
to
London
,
and
it
was
he
I
saw
.
He
has
got
younger
,
and
how
?
Van
Helsing
*NL*
is
the
man
to
unmask
him
and
hunt
him
out
,
if
he
is
anything
like
what
*NL*
Mina
says
.
We
sat
late
,
and
talked
it
all
over
.
Mina
is
dressing
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
call
at
the
hotel
in
a
few
minutes
and
bring
him
over
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
I
think
,
surprised
to
see
me
.
When
I
came
into
the
room
where
he
*NL*
was
,
and
introduced
myself
,
he
took
me
by
the
shoulder
,
and
turned
my
*NL*
face
round
to
the
light
,
and
said
,
after
a
sharp
scrutiny
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Madam
Mina
told
me
you
were
ill
,
that
you
had
had
a
shock
.
''
It
was
*NL*
so
funny
to
hear
my
wife
called
``
Madam
Mina
''
by
this
kindly
,
*NL*
strong-faced
old
man
.
I
smiled
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
was
_
ill
,
I
_
have
_
had
a
shock
;
but
you
have
cured
me
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
your
letter
to
Mina
last
night
.
I
was
in
doubt
,
and
then
everything
*NL*
took
a
hue
of
unreality
,
and
I
did
not
know
what
to
trust
,
even
the
*NL*
evidence
of
my
own
senses
.
Not
knowing
what
to
trust
,
I
did
not
know
*NL*
what
to
do
;
and
so
had
only
to
keep
on
working
in
what
had
hitherto
been
*NL*
the
groove
of
my
life
.
The
groove
ceased
to
avail
me
,
and
I
mistrusted
*NL*
myself
.
Doctor
,
you
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
doubt
everything
,
even
*NL*
yourself
.
No
,
you
do
n't
;
you
could
n't
with
eyebrows
like
yours
.
''
He
*NL*
seemed
pleased
,
and
laughed
as
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
!
You
are
physiognomist
.
I
learn
more
here
with
each
hour
.
I
am
with
*NL*
so
much
pleasure
coming
to
you
to
breakfast
;
and
,
oh
,
sir
,
you
will
*NL*
pardon
praise
from
an
old
man
,
but
you
are
blessed
in
your
wife
.
''
I
*NL*
would
listen
to
him
go
on
praising
Mina
for
a
day
,
so
I
simply
nodded
*NL*
and
stood
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
one
of
God
's
women
,
fashioned
by
His
own
hand
to
show
us
men
and
*NL*
other
women
that
there
is
a
heaven
where
we
can
enter
,
and
that
its
*NL*
light
can
be
here
on
earth
.
So
true
,
so
sweet
,
so
noble
,
so
little
an
*NL*
egoist
--
and
that
,
let
me
tell
you
,
is
much
in
this
age
,
so
sceptical
and
*NL*
selfish
.
And
you
,
sir
--
I
have
read
all
the
letters
to
poor
Miss
Lucy
,
*NL*
and
some
of
them
speak
of
you
,
so
I
know
you
since
some
days
from
the
*NL*
knowing
of
others
;
but
I
have
seen
your
true
self
since
last
night
.
You
*NL*
will
give
me
your
hand
,
will
you
not
?
And
let
us
be
friends
for
all
our
*NL*
lives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
shook
hands
,
and
he
was
so
earnest
and
so
kind
that
it
made
me
quite
*NL*
choky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
he
said
,
``
may
I
ask
you
for
some
more
help
?
I
have
a
great
*NL*
task
to
do
,
and
at
the
beginning
it
is
to
know
.
You
can
help
me
here
.
*NL*
Can
you
tell
me
what
went
before
your
going
to
Transylvania
?
Later
on
I
*NL*
may
ask
more
help
,
and
of
a
different
kind
;
but
at
first
this
will
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here

I
said
,
``
does

you
have
to
do

*NL*
*NL*
``

does

said
solemnly

``

the
bundle
of
papers
.
*NL*
You
can
take
them
with
you
and
read
them
in
the
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
I
saw
him
to
the
station
.
When
we
were
parting
he
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
will
come
to
town
if
I
send
to
you
,
and
take
Madam
Mina
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
both
come
when
you
will
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
got
him
the
morning
papers
and
the
London
papers
of
the
previous
*NL*
night
,
and
while
we
were
talking
at
the
carriage
window
,
waiting
for
the
*NL*
train
to
start
,
he
was
turning
them
over
.
His
eyes
suddenly
seemed
to
*NL*
catch
something
in
one
of
them
,
``
The
Westminster
Gazette
''
--
I
knew
it
by
*NL*
the
colour
--
and
he
grew
quite
white
.
He
read
something
intently
,
*NL*
groaning
to
himself
:
``
Mein
Gott
!
Mein
Gott
!
So
soon
!
so
soon
!
''
I
do
not
*NL*
think
he
remembered
me
at
the
moment
.
Just
then
the
whistle
blew
,
and
*NL*
the
train
moved
off
.
This
recalled
him
to
himself
,
and
he
leaned
out
of
*NL*
the
window
and
waved
his
hand
,
calling
out
:
``
Love
to
Madam
Mina
;
I
shall
*NL*
write
so
soon
as
ever
I
can
.

26
September
.
_
--
Truly
there
is
no
such
thing
as
finality
.
Not
a
week
*NL*
since
I
said
``
Finis
,
''
and
yet
here
I
am
starting
fresh
again
,
or
rather
*NL*
going
on
with
the
same
record
.
Until
this
afternoon
I
had
no
cause
to
*NL*
think
of
what
is
done
.
Renfield
had
become
,
to
all
intents
,
as
sane
as
*NL*
he
ever
was
.
He
was
already
well
ahead
with
his
fly
business
;
and
he
had
*NL*
just
started
in
the
spider
line
also
;
so
he
had
not
been
of
any
trouble
*NL*
to
me
.
I
had
a
letter
from
Arthur
,
written
on
Sunday
,
and
from
it
I
*NL*
gather
that
he
is
bearing
up
wonderfully
well
.
Quincey
Morris
is
with
*NL*
him
,
and
that
is
much
of
a
help
,
for
he
himself
is
a
bubbling
well
of
*NL*
good
spirits
.
Quincey
wrote
me
a
line
too
,
and
from
him
I
hear
that
*NL*
Arthur
is
beginning
to
recover
something
of
his
old
buoyancy
;
so
as
to
*NL*
them
all
my
mind
is
at
rest
.
As
for
myself
,
I
was
settling
down
to
my
*NL*
work
with
the
enthusiasm
which
I
used
to
have
for
it
,
so
that
I
might
*NL*
fairly
have
said
that
the
wound
which
poor
Lucy
left
on
me
was
becoming
*NL*
cicatrised
.
Everything
is
,
however
,
now
reopened
;
and
what
is
to
be
the
*NL*
end
God
only
knows
.
I
have
an
idea
that
Van
Helsing
thinks
he
knows
,
*NL*
too
,
but
he
will
only
let
out
enough
at
a
time
to
whet
curiosity
.
He
*NL*
went
to
Exeter
yesterday
,
and
stayed
there
all
night
.
To-day
he
came
*NL*
back
,
and
almost
bounded
into
the
room
at
about
half-past
five
o'clock
,
*NL*
and
thrust
last
night
's
``
Westminster
Gazette
''
into
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
that
?
''
he
asked
as
he
stood
back
and
folded
his
*NL*
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
over
the
paper
,
for
I
really
did
not
know
what
he
meant
;
but
he
*NL*
took
it
from
me
and
pointed
out
a
paragraph
about
children
being
decoyed
*NL*
away
at
Hampstead
.
It
did
not
convey
much
to
me
,
until
I
reached
a
*NL*
passage
where
it
described
small
punctured
wounds
on
their
throats
.
An
*NL*
idea
struck
me
,
and
I
looked
up
.
``
Well
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
like
poor
Lucy
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
make
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
that
there
is
some
cause
in
common
.
Whatever
it
was
that
injured
*NL*
her
has
injured
them
.
''
I
did
not
quite
understand
his
answer
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
indirectly
,
but
not
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
,
Professor
?
''
I
asked
.
I
was
a
little
inclined
to
take
*NL*
his
seriousness
lightly
--
for
,
after
all
,
four
days
of
rest
and
freedom
*NL*
from
burning
,
harrowing
anxiety
does
help
to
restore
one
's
spirits
--
but
*NL*
when
I
saw
his
face
,
it
sobered
me
.
Never
,
even
in
the
midst
of
our
*NL*
despair
about
poor
Lucy
,
had
he
looked
more
stern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
!
''
I
said
.
``
I
can
hazard
no
opinion
.
I
do
not
know
what
to
*NL*
think
,
and
I
have
no
data
on
which
to
found
a
conjecture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
friend
John
,
that
you
have
no
suspicion
as
to
*NL*
what
poor
Lucy
died
of
;
not
after
all
the
hints
given
,
not
only
by
*NL*
events
,
but
by
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
nervous
prostration
following
on
great
loss
or
waste
of
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
the
blood
lost
or
waste
?
''
I
shook
my
head
.
He
stepped
over
and
*NL*
sat
down
beside
me
,
and
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
clever
man
,
friend
John
;
you
reason
well
,
and
your
wit
is
bold
;
*NL*
but
you
are
too
prejudiced
.
You
do
not
let
your
eyes
see
nor
your
ears
*NL*
hear
,
and
that
which
is
outside
your
daily
life
is
not
of
account
to
*NL*
you
.
Do
you
not
think
that
there
are
things
which
you
can
not
understand
,
*NL*
and
yet
which
are
;
that
some
people
see
things
that
others
can
not
?
But
*NL*
there
are
things
old
and
new
which
must
not
be
contemplate
by
men
's
*NL*
eyes
,
because
they
know
--
or
think
they
know
--
some
things
which
other
men
*NL*
have
told
them
.
Ah
,
it
is
the
fault
of
our
science
that
it
wants
to
*NL*
explain
all
;
and
if
it
explain
not
,
then
it
says
there
is
nothing
to
*NL*
explain
.
But
yet
we
see
around
us
every
day
the
growth
of
new
beliefs
,
*NL*
which
think
themselves
new
;
and
which
are
yet
but
the
old
,
which
pretend
*NL*
to
be
young
--
like
the
fine
ladies
at
the
opera
.
I
suppose
now
you
do
not
*NL*
believe
in
corporeal
transference
.
No
?
Nor
in
materialisation
.
No
?
Nor
*NL*
in
astral
bodies
.
No
?
Nor
in
the
reading
of
thought
.
No
?
Nor
in
*NL*
hypnotism
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
.
``
Charcot
has
proved
that
pretty
well
.
''
He
smiled
as
he
*NL*
went
on
:
``
Then
you
are
satisfied
as
to
it
.
Yes
?
And
of
course
then
you
*NL*
understand
how
it
act
,
and
can
follow
the
mind
of
the
great
*NL*
Charcot
--
alas
that
he
is
no
more
!
--
into
the
very
soul
of
the
patient
*NL*
that
he
influence
.
No
?
Then
,
friend
John
,
am
I
to
take
it
that
you
*NL*
simply
accept
fact
,
and
are
satisfied
to
let
from
premise
to
conclusion
*NL*
be
a
blank
?
No
?
Then
tell
me
--
for
I
am
student
of
the
brain
--
how
you
*NL*
accept
the
hypnotism
and
reject
the
thought
reading
.
Let
me
tell
you
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
that
there
are
things
done
to-day
in
electrical
science
which
*NL*
would
have
been
deemed
unholy
by
the
very
men
who
discovered
*NL*
electricity
--
who
would
themselves
not
so
long
before
have
been
burned
*NL*
as
wizards
.
There
are
always
mysteries
in
life
.
Why
was
it
that
*NL*
Methuselah
lived
nine
hundred
years
,
and
`
Old
Parr
'
one
hundred
and
*NL*
sixty-nine
,
and
yet
that
poor
Lucy
,
with
four
men
's
blood
in
her
poor
*NL*
veins
,
could
not
live
even
one
day
?
For
,
had
she
live
one
more
day
,
we
*NL*
could
have
save
her
.
Do
you
know
all
the
mystery
of
life
and
death
?
Do
*NL*
you
know
the
altogether
of
comparative
anatomy
and
can
say
wherefore
the
*NL*
qualities
of
brutes
are
in
some
men
,
and
not
in
others
?
Can
you
tell
me
*NL*
why
,
when
other
spiders
die
small
and
soon
,
that
one
great
spider
lived
*NL*
for
centuries
in
the
tower
of
the
old
Spanish
church
and
grew
and
grew
,
*NL*
till
,
on
descending
,
he
could
drink
the
oil
of
all
the
church
lamps
?
Can
*NL*
you
tell
me
why
in
the
Pampas
,
ay
and
elsewhere
,
there
are
bats
that
*NL*
come
at
night
and
open
the
veins
of
cattle
and
horses
and
suck
dry
their
*NL*
veins
;
how
in
some
islands
of
the
Western
seas
there
are
bats
which
hang
*NL*
on
the
trees
all
day
,
and
those
who
have
seen
describe
as
like
giant
*NL*
nuts
or
pods
,
and
that
when
the
sailors
sleep
on
the
deck
,
because
that
*NL*
it
is
hot
,
flit
down
on
them
,
and
then
--
and
then
in
the
morning
are
*NL*
found
dead
men
,
white
as
even
Miss
Lucy
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
Professor
!
''
I
said
,
starting
up
.
``
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
*NL*
Lucy
was
bitten
by
such
a
bat
;
and
that
such
a
thing
is
here
in
London
*NL*
in
the
nineteenth
century
?
''
He
waved
his
hand
for
silence
,
and
went
*NL*
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
tell
me
why
the
tortoise
lives
more
long
than
generations
of
*NL*
men
;
why
the
elephant
goes
on
and
on
till
he
have
seen
dynasties
;
and
*NL*
why
the
parrot
never
die
only
of
bite
of
cat
or
dog
or
other
complaint
?
*NL*
Can
you
tell
me
why
men
believe
in
all
ages
and
places
that
there
are
*NL*
some
few
who
live
on
always
if
they
be
permit
;
that
there
are
men
and
*NL*
women
who
can
not
die
?
We
all
know
--
because
science
has
vouched
for
the
*NL*
fact
--
that
there
have
been
toads
shut
up
in
rocks
for
thousands
of
*NL*
years
,
shut
in
one
so
small
hole
that
only
hold
him
since
the
youth
of
*NL*
the
world
.
Can
you
tell
me
how
the
Indian
fakir
can
make
himself
to
die
*NL*
and
have
been
buried
,
and
his
grave
sealed
and
corn
sowed
on
it
,
and
the
*NL*
corn
reaped
and
be
cut
and
sown
and
reaped
and
cut
again
,
and
then
men
*NL*
come
and
take
away
the
unbroken
seal
and
that
there
lie
the
Indian
*NL*
fakir
,
not
dead
,
but
that
rise
up
and
walk
amongst
them
as
before
?
''
Here
*NL*
I
interrupted
him
.
I
was
getting
bewildered
;
he
so
crowded
on
my
mind
*NL*
his
list
of
nature
's
eccentricities
and
possible
impossibilities
that
my
*NL*
imagination
was
getting
fired
.
I
had
a
dim
idea
that
he
was
teaching
me
*NL*
some
lesson
,
as
long
ago
he
used
to
do
in
his
study
at
Amsterdam
;
but
*NL*
he
used
then
to
tell
me
the
thing
,
so
that
I
could
have
the
object
of
*NL*
thought
in
mind
all
the
time
.
But
now
I
was
without
this
help
,
yet
I
*NL*
wanted
to
follow
him
,
so
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Professor
,
let
me
be
your
pet
student
again
.
Tell
me
the
thesis
,
so
*NL*
that
I
may
apply
your
knowledge
as
you
go
on
.
At
present
I
am
going
in
*NL*
my
mind
from
point
to
point
as
a
mad
man
,
and
not
a
sane
one
,
follows
an
*NL*
idea
.
I
feel
like
a
novice
lumbering
through
a
bog
in
a
mist
,
jumping
*NL*
from
one
tussock
to
another
in
the
mere
blind
effort
to
move
on
without
*NL*
knowing
where
I
am
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good
image
,
''
he
said
.
``
Well
,
I
shall
tell
you
.
My
thesis
is
*NL*
this
:
I
want
you
to
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
believe
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
believe
in
things
that
you
can
not
.
Let
me
illustrate
.
I
heard
once
*NL*
of
an
American
who
so
defined
faith
:
`
that
faculty
which
enables
us
to
*NL*
believe
things
which
we
know
to
be
untrue
.
'
For
one
,
I
follow
that
man
.
*NL*
He
meant
that
we
shall
have
an
open
mind
,
and
not
let
a
little
bit
of
*NL*
truth
check
the
rush
of
a
big
truth
,
like
a
small
rock
does
a
railway
*NL*
truck
.
We
get
the
small
truth
first
.
Good
!
We
keep
him
,
and
we
value
*NL*
him
;
but
all
the
same
we
must
not
let
him
think
himself
all
the
truth
in
*NL*
the
universe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
want
me
not
to
let
some
previous
conviction
injure
the
*NL*
receptivity
of
my
mind
with
regard
to
some
strange
matter
.
Do
I
read
*NL*
your
lesson
aright
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
my
favourite
pupil
still
.
It
is
worth
to
teach
you
.
Now
*NL*
that
you
are
willing
to
understand
,
you
have
taken
the
first
step
to
*NL*
understand
.
You
think
then
that
those
so
small
holes
in
the
children
's
*NL*
throats
were
made
by
the
same
that
made
the
hole
in
Miss
Lucy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
.
''
He
stood
up
and
said
solemnly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
wrong
.
Oh
,
would
it
were
so
!
but
alas
!
no

It
is
worse

*NL*
far
,
far
worse

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
God
's
name

Professor
Van
Helsing

what
do
you
mean
?

I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
himself
with
a
despairing
gesture
into
a
chair
,
and
placed
his
*NL*
elbows
on
the
table
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
as
he
spoke

*NL*
*NL*
For
a
while
sheer
anger
mastered
me
;
it
was
as
if
he
had
during
her
life
*NL*
struck
Lucy
on
the
face
.
I
smote
the
table
hard
and
rose
up
as
I
said
to
*NL*
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
are
you
mad
?
''
He
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
me
,
and
*NL*
somehow
the
tenderness
of
his
face
calmed
me
at
once
.
``
Would
I
were
!
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
Madness
were
easy
to
bear
compared
with
truth
like
this
.
Oh
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
why
,
think
you
,
did
I
go
so
far
round
,
why
take
so
long
to
tell
*NL*
you
so
simple
a
thing
?
Was
it
because
I
hate
you
and
have
hated
you
all
*NL*
my
life
?
Was
it
because
I
wished
to
give
you
pain
?
Was
it
that
I
wanted
,
*NL*
now
so
late
,
revenge
for
that
time
when
you
saved
my
life
,
and
from
a
*NL*
fearful
death
?
Ah
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
''
said
I
.
He
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
it
was
because
I
wished
to
be
gentle
in
the
breaking
to
you
,
*NL*
for
I
know
you
have
loved
that
so
sweet
lady
.
But
even
yet
I
do
not
*NL*
expect
you
to
believe
.
It
is
so
hard
to
accept
at
once
any
abstract
*NL*
truth
,
that
we
may
doubt
such
to
be
possible
when
we
have
always
*NL*
believed
the
`
no
'
of
it
;
it
is
more
hard
still
to
accept
so
sad
a
*NL*
concrete
truth
,
and
of
such
a
one
as
Miss
Lucy
.
To-night
I
go
to
prove
*NL*
it
.
Dare
you
come
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
staggered
me
.
A
man
does
not
like
to
prove
such
a
truth
;
Byron
*NL*
excepted
from
the
category
,
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
prove
the
very
truth
he
most
abhorred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
my
hesitation
,
and
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
logic
is
simple
,
no
madman
's
logic
this
time
,
jumping
from
tussock
*NL*
to
tussock
in
a
misty
bog
.
If
it
be
not
true
,
then
proof
will
be
relief
;
*NL*
at
worst
it
will
not
harm
.
If
it
be
true
!
Ah
,
there
is
the
dread
;
yet
*NL*
very
dread
should
help
my
cause
,
for
in
it
is
some
need
of
belief
.
Come
,
*NL*
I
tell
you
what
I
propose
:
first
,
that
we
go
off
now
and
see
that
child
*NL*
in
the
hospital
.
Dr.
Vincent
,
of
the
North
Hospital
,
where
the
papers
*NL*
say
the
child
is
,
is
friend
of
mine
,
and
I
think
of
yours
since
you
were
*NL*
in
class
at
Amsterdam
.
He
will
let
two
scientists
see
his
case
,
if
he
*NL*
will
not
let
two
friends
.
We
shall
tell
him
nothing
,
but
only
that
we
*NL*
wish
to
learn
.
And
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
?
''
He
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
up
.
``
And
then
we
*NL*
spend
the
night
,
you
and
I
,
in
the
churchyard
where
Lucy
lies
.
This
is
*NL*
the
key
that
lock
the
tomb
.
I
had
it
from
the
coffin-man
to
give
to
*NL*
Arthur
.
''
My
heart
sank
within
me
,
for
I
felt
that
there
was
some
fearful
*NL*
ordeal
before
us
.
I
could
do
nothing
,
however
,
so
I
plucked
up
what
*NL*
heart
I
could
and
said
that
we
had
better
hasten
,
as
the
afternoon
was
*NL*
passing
...
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
the
child
awake
.
It
had
had
a
sleep
and
taken
some
food
,
and
*NL*
altogether
was
going
on
well
.
Dr.
Vincent
took
the
bandage
from
its
*NL*
throat
,
and
showed
us
the
punctures
.
There
was
no
mistaking
the
*NL*
similarity
to
those
which
had
been
on
Lucy
's
throat
.
They
were
smaller
,
*NL*
and
the
edges
looked
fresher
;
that
was
all
.
We
asked
Vincent
to
what
he
*NL*
attributed
them
,
and
he
replied
that
it
must
have
been
a
bite
of
some
*NL*
animal
,
perhaps
a
rat
;
but
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
was
inclined
to
think
*NL*
that
it
was
one
of
the
bats
which
are
so
numerous
on
the
northern
*NL*
heights
of
London
.
``
Out
of
so
many
harmless
ones
,
''
he
said
,
``
there
may
*NL*
be
some
wild
specimen
from
the
South
of
a
more
malignant
species
.
Some
*NL*
sailor
may
have
brought
one
home
,
and
it
managed
to
escape
;
or
even
from
*NL*
the
Zooelogical
Gardens
a
young
one
may
have
got
loose
,
or
one
be
bred
*NL*
there
from
a
vampire
.
These
things
do
occur
,
you
know
.
Only
ten
days
ago
*NL*
a
wolf
got
out
,
and
was
,
I
believe
,
traced
up
in
this
direction
.
For
a
*NL*
week
after
,
the
children
were
playing
nothing
but
Red
Riding
Hood
on
the
*NL*
Heath
and
in
every
alley
in
the
place
until
this
`
bloofer
lady
'
scare
*NL*
came
along
,
since
when
it
has
been
quite
a
gala-time
with
them
.
Even
*NL*
this
poor
little
mite
,
when
he
woke
up
to-day
,
asked
the
nurse
if
he
*NL*
might
go
away
.
When
she
asked
him
why
he
wanted
to
go
,
he
said
he
wanted
*NL*
to
play
with
the
`
bloofer
lady
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
said
Van
Helsing
,
``
that
when
you
are
sending
the
child
home
*NL*
you
will
caution
its
parents
to
keep
strict
watch
over
it
.
These
fancies
*NL*
to
stray
are
most
dangerous
;
and
if
the
child
were
to
remain
out
another
*NL*
night
,
it
would
probably
be
fatal
.
But
in
any
case
I
suppose
you
will
*NL*
not
let
it
away
for
some
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
not
for
a
week
at
least
;
longer
if
the
wound
is
not
*NL*
healed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
visit
to
the
hospital
took
more
time
than
we
had
reckoned
on
,
and
*NL*
the
sun
had
dipped
before
we
came
out
.
When
Van
Helsing
saw
how
dark
it
*NL*
was
,
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
hurry
.
It
is
more
late
than
I
thought
.
Come
,
let
us
seek
*NL*
somewhere
that
we
may
eat
,
and
then
we
shall
go
on
our
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
dined
at
``
Jack
Straw
's
Castle
''
along
with
a
little
crowd
of
*NL*
bicyclists
and
others
who
were
genially
noisy
.
About
ten
o'clock
we
*NL*
started
from
the
inn
.
It
was
then
very
dark
,
and
the
scattered
lamps
*NL*
made
the
darkness
greater
when
we
were
once
outside
their
individual
*NL*
radius
.
The
Professor
had
evidently
noted
the
road
we
were
to
go
,
for
he
*NL*
went
on
unhesitatingly
;
but
,
as
for
me
,
I
was
in
quite
a
mixup
as
to
*NL*
locality
.
As
we
went
further
,
we
met
fewer
and
fewer
people
,
till
at
*NL*
last
we
were
somewhat
surprised
when
we
met
even
the
patrol
of
horse
*NL*
police
going
their
usual
suburban
round
.
At
last
we
reached
the
wall
of
*NL*
the
churchyard
,
which
we
climbed
over
.
With
some
little
difficulty
--
for
*NL*
it
was
very
dark
,
and
the
whole
place
seemed
so
strange
to
us
--
we
found
*NL*
the
Westenra
tomb
.
The
Professor
took
the
key
,
opened
the
creaky
door
,
*NL*
and
standing
back
,
politely
,
but
quite
unconsciously
,
motioned
me
to
*NL*
precede
him
.
There
was
a
delicious
irony
in
the
offer
,
in
the
*NL*
courtliness
of
giving
preference
on
such
a
ghastly
occasion
.
My
*NL*
companion
followed
me
quickly
,
and
cautiously
drew
the
door
to
,
after
*NL*
carefully
ascertaining
that
the
lock
was
a
falling
,
and
not
a
spring
,
*NL*
one
.
In
the
latter
case
we
should
have
been
in
a
bad
plight
.
Then
he
*NL*
fumbled
in
his
bag
,
and
taking
out
a
matchbox
and
a
piece
of
candle
,
*NL*
proceeded
to
make
a
light
.
The
tomb
in
the
day-time
,
and
when
wreathed
*NL*
with
fresh
flowers
,
had
looked
grim
and
gruesome
enough
;
but
now
,
some
*NL*
days
afterwards
,
when
the
flowers
hung
lank
and
dead
,
their
whites
*NL*
turning
to
rust
and
their
greens
to
browns
;
when
the
spider
and
the
*NL*
beetle
had
resumed
their
accustomed
dominance
;
when
time-discoloured
*NL*
stone
,
and
dust-encrusted
mortar
,
and
rusty
,
dank
iron
,
and
tarnished
*NL*
brass
,
and
clouded
silver-plating
gave
back
the
feeble
glimmer
of
a
*NL*
candle
,
the
effect
was
more
miserable
and
sordid
than
could
have
been
*NL*
imagined
.
It
conveyed
irresistibly
the
idea
that
life
--
animal
life
--
was
*NL*
not
the
only
thing
which
could
pass
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
went
about
his
work
systematically
.
Holding
his
candle
so
*NL*
that
he
could
read
the
coffin
plates
,
and
so
holding
it
that
the
sperm
*NL*
dropped
in
white
patches
which
congealed
as
they
touched
the
metal
,
he
*NL*
made
assurance
of
Lucy
's
coffin
.
Another
search
in
his
bag
,
and
he
took
*NL*
out
a
turnscrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
open
the
coffin
.
You
shall
yet
be
convinced
.
''
Straightway
he
began
*NL*
taking
out
the
screws
,
and
finally
lifted
off
the
lid
,
showing
the
*NL*
casing
of
lead
beneath
.
The
sight
was
almost
too
much
for
me
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
be
as
much
an
affront
to
the
dead
as
it
would
have
been
to
have
*NL*
stripped
off
her
clothing
in
her
sleep
whilst
living
;
I
actually
took
*NL*
hold
of
his
hand
to
stop
him
.
He
only
said
:
``
You
shall
see
,
''
and
again
*NL*
fumbling
in
his
bag
,
took
out
a
tiny
fret-saw
.
Striking
the
turnscrew
*NL*
through
the
lead
with
a
swift
downward
stab
,
which
made
me
wince
,
he
*NL*
made
a
small
hole
,
which
was
,
however
,
big
enough
to
admit
the
point
of
*NL*
the
saw
.
I
had
expected
a
rush
of
gas
from
the
week-old
corpse
.
We
*NL*
doctors
,
who
have
had
to
study
our
dangers
,
have
to
become
accustomed
to
*NL*
such
things
,
and
I
drew
back
towards
the
door
.
But
the
Professor
never
*NL*
stopped
for
a
moment
;
he
sawed
down
a
couple
of
feet
along
one
side
of
*NL*
the
lead
coffin
,
and
then
across
,
and
down
the
other
side
.
Taking
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
loose
flange
,
he
bent
it
back
towards
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
coffin
,
and
holding
up
the
candle
into
the
aperture
,
motioned
to
me
to
*NL*
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
drew
near
and
looked
.
The
coffin
was
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
certainly
a
surprise
to
me
,
and
gave
me
a
considerable
shock
,
but
*NL*
Van
Helsing
was
unmoved
.
He
was
now
more
sure
than
ever
of
his
ground
,
*NL*
and
so
emboldened
to
proceed
in
his
task
.
``
Are
you
satisfied
now
,
friend
*NL*
John
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
all
the
dogged
argumentativeness
of
my
nature
awake
within
me
as
*NL*
I
answered
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
satisfied
that
Lucy
's
body
is
not
in
that
coffin
;
but
that
only
*NL*
proves
one
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
that
,
friend
John
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
is
not
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good
logic
,
''
he
said
,
``
so
far
as
it
goes
.
But
how
do
you
--
how
*NL*
can
you
--
account
for
it
not
being
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
a
body-snatcher
,
''
I
suggested
.
``
Some
of
the
undertaker
's
people
*NL*
may
have
stolen
it
.
''
I
felt
that
I
was
speaking
folly
,
and
yet
it
was
*NL*
the
only
real
cause
which
I
could
suggest
.
The
Professor
sighed
.
``
Ah
*NL*
well
!
''
he
said
,
``
we
must
have
more
proof
.
Come
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
on
the
coffin-lid
again
,
gathered
up
all
his
things
and
placed
*NL*
them
in
the
bag
,
blew
out
the
light
,
and
placed
the
candle
also
in
the
*NL*
bag
.
We
opened
the
door
,
and
went
out
.
Behind
us
he
closed
the
door
and
*NL*
locked
it
.
He
handed
me
the
key
,
saying
:
``
Will
you
keep
it
?
You
had
*NL*
better
be
assured
.
''
I
laughed
--
it
was
not
a
very
cheerful
laugh
,
I
am
*NL*
bound
to
say
--
as
I
motioned
him
to
keep
it
.
``
A
key
is
nothing
,
''
I
said
;
*NL*
``
there
may
be
duplicates
;
and
anyhow
it
is
not
difficult
to
pick
a
lock
*NL*
of
that
kind
.
''
He
said
nothing
,
but
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
Then
he
*NL*
told
me
to
watch
at
one
side
of
the
churchyard
whilst
he
would
watch
at
*NL*
the
other
.
I
took
up
my
place
behind
a
yew-tree
,
and
I
saw
his
dark
*NL*
figure
move
until
the
intervening
headstones
and
trees
hid
it
from
my
*NL*
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lonely
vigil
.
Just
after
I
had
taken
my
place
I
heard
a
distant
*NL*
clock
strike
twelve
,
and
in
time
came
one
and
two
.
I
was
chilled
and
*NL*
unnerved
,
and
angry
with
the
Professor
for
taking
me
on
such
an
errand
*NL*
and
with
myself
for
coming
.
I
was
too
cold
and
too
sleepy
to
be
keenly
*NL*
observant
,
and
not
sleepy
enough
to
betray
my
trust
so
altogether
I
had
*NL*
a
dreary
,
miserable
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
as
I
turned
round
,
I
thought
I
saw
something
like
a
white
*NL*
streak
,
moving
between
two
dark
yew-trees
at
the
side
of
the
churchyard
*NL*
farthest
from
the
tomb
;
at
the
same
time
a
dark
mass
moved
from
the
*NL*
Professor
's
side
of
the
ground
,
and
hurriedly
went
towards
it
.
Then
I
*NL*
too
moved
;
but
I
had
to
go
round
headstones
and
railed-off
tombs
,
and
I
*NL*
stumbled
over
graves
.
The
sky
was
overcast
,
and
somewhere
far
off
an
*NL*
early
cock
crew
.
A
little
way
off
,
beyond
a
line
of
scattered
*NL*
juniper-trees
,
which
marked
the
pathway
to
the
church
,
a
white
,
dim
*NL*
figure
flitted
in
the
direction
of
the
tomb
.
The
tomb
itself
was
hidden
*NL*
by
trees
,
and
I
could
not
see
where
the
figure
disappeared
.
I
heard
the
*NL*
rustle
of
actual
movement
where
I
had
first
seen
the
white
figure
,
and
*NL*
coming
over
,
found
the
Professor
holding
in
his
arms
a
tiny
child
.
When
*NL*
he
saw
me
he
held
it
out
to
me
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
satisfied
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
said
,
in
a
way
that
I
felt
was
aggressive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
see
the
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
a
child
,
but
who
brought
it
here
?
And
is
it
wounded
?
''
I
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
,
''
said
the
Professor
,
and
with
one
impulse
we
took
our
way
*NL*
out
of
the
churchyard
,
he
carrying
the
sleeping
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
got
some
little
distance
away
,
we
went
into
a
clump
of
*NL*
trees
,
and
struck
a
match
,
and
looked
at
the
child
's
throat
.
It
was
*NL*
without
a
scratch
or
scar
of
any
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
right
?
''
I
asked
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
just
in
time
,
''
said
the
Professor
thankfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
now
to
decide
what
we
were
to
do
with
the
child
,
and
so
consulted
*NL*
about
it
.
If
we
were
to
take
it
to
a
police-station
we
should
have
to
*NL*
give
some
account
of
our
movements
during
the
night
;
at
least
,
we
should
*NL*
have
had
to
make
some
statement
as
to
how
we
had
come
to
find
the
child
.
*NL*
So
finally
we
decided
that
we
would
take
it
to
the
Heath
,
and
when
we
*NL*
heard
a
policeman
coming
,
would
leave
it
where
he
could
not
fail
to
find
*NL*
it
;
we
would
then
seek
our
way
home
as
quickly
as
we
could
.
All
fell
out
*NL*
well
.
At
the
edge
of
Hampstead
Heath
we
heard
a
policeman
's
heavy
*NL*
tramp
,
and
laying
the
child
on
the
pathway
,
we
waited
and
watched
until
*NL*
he
saw
it
as
he
flashed
his
lantern
to
and
fro
.
We
heard
his
exclamation
*NL*
of
astonishment
,
and
then
we
went
away
silently
.
By
good
chance
we
got
a
*NL*
cab
near
the
``
Spaniards
,
''
and
drove
to
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
sleep
,
so
I
make
this
entry
.
But
I
must
try
to
get
a
few
hours
'
*NL*
sleep
,
as
Van
Helsing
is
to
call
for
me
at
noon
.
He
insists
that
I
shall
*NL*
go
with
him
on
another
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
_
27
September
.
_
--
It
was
two
o'clock
before
we
found
a
suitable
*NL*
opportunity
for
our
attempt
.
The
funeral
held
at
noon
was
all
completed
,
*NL*
and
the
last
stragglers
of
the
mourners
had
taken
themselves
lazily
*NL*
away
,
when
,
looking
carefully
from
behind
a
clump
of
alder-trees
,
we
saw
*NL*
the
sexton
lock
the
gate
after
him
.
We
knew
then
that
we
were
safe
till
*NL*
morning
did
we
desire
it
;
but
the
Professor
told
me
that
we
should
not
*NL*
want
more
than
an
hour
at
most
.
Again
I
felt
that
horrid
sense
of
the
*NL*
reality
of
things
,
in
which
any
effort
of
imagination
seemed
out
of
*NL*
place
;
and
I
realised
distinctly
the
perils
of
the
law
which
we
were
*NL*
incurring
in
our
unhallowed
work
.
Besides
,
I
felt
it
was
all
so
useless
.
*NL*
Outrageous
as
it
was
to
open
a
leaden
coffin
,
to
see
if
a
woman
dead
*NL*
nearly
a
week
were
really
dead
,
it
now
seemed
the
height
of
folly
to
*NL*
open
the
tomb
again
,
when
we
knew
,
from
the
evidence
of
our
own
*NL*
eyesight
,
that
the
coffin
was
empty
.
I
shrugged
my
shoulders
,
however
,
*NL*
and
rested
silent
,
for
Van
Helsing
had
a
way
of
going
on
his
own
road
,
*NL*
no
matter
who
remonstrated
.
He
took
the
key
,
opened
the
vault
,
and
again
*NL*
courteously
motioned
me
to
precede
.
The
place
was
not
so
gruesome
as
*NL*
last
night
,
but
oh
,
how
unutterably
mean-looking
when
the
sunshine
*NL*
streamed
in
.
Van
Helsing
walked
over
to
Lucy
's
coffin
,
and
I
followed
.
*NL*
He
bent
over
and
again
forced
back
the
leaden
flange
;
and
then
a
shock
*NL*
of
surprise
and
dismay
shot
through
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
lay
Lucy
,
seemingly
just
as
we
had
seen
her
the
night
before
her
*NL*
funeral
.
She
was
,
if
possible
,
more
radiantly
beautiful
than
ever
;
and
I
*NL*
could
not
believe
that
she
was
dead
.
The
lips
were
red
,
nay
redder
than
*NL*
before
;
and
on
the
cheeks
was
a
delicate
bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
a
juggle
?
''
I
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
convinced
now
?
''
said
the
Professor
in
response
,
and
as
he
spoke
*NL*
he
put
over
his
hand
,
and
in
a
way
that
made
me
shudder
,
pulled
back
the
*NL*
dead
lips
and
showed
the
white
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
see
,
they
are
even
sharper
than
before
.
With
this
*NL*
and
this
''
--
and
he
touched
one
of
the
canine
teeth
and
that
below
*NL*
it
--
``
the
little
children
can
be
bitten
.
Are
you
of
belief
now
,
friend
*NL*
John
?
''
Once
more
,
argumentative
hostility
woke
within
me
.
I
_
could
_
not
*NL*
accept
such
an
overwhelming
idea
as
he
suggested
;
so
,
with
an
attempt
to
*NL*
argue
of
which
I
was
even
at
the
moment
ashamed
,
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
may
have
been
placed
here
since
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
That
is
so
,
and
by
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
.
Some
one
has
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
she
has
been
dead
one
week
.
Most
peoples
in
that
time
would
not
*NL*
look
so
.
''
I
had
no
answer
for
this
,
so
was
silent
.
Van
Helsing
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
notice
my
silence
;
at
any
rate
,
he
showed
neither
chagrin
nor
*NL*
triumph
.
He
was
looking
intently
at
the
face
of
the
dead
woman
,
raising
*NL*
the
eyelids
and
looking
at
the
eyes
,
and
once
more
opening
the
lips
and
*NL*
examining
the
teeth
.
Then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
there
is
one
thing
which
is
different
from
all
recorded
;
here
is
*NL*
some
dual
life
that
is
not
as
the
common
.
She
was
bitten
by
the
vampire
*NL*
when
she
was
in
a
trance
,
sleep-walking
--
oh
,
you
start
;
you
do
not
know
*NL*
that
,
friend
John
,
but
you
shall
know
it
all
later
--
and
in
trance
could
*NL*
he
best
come
to
take
more
blood
.
In
trance
she
died
,
and
in
trance
she
*NL*
is
Un-Dead
,
too
.
So
it
is
that
she
differ
from
all
other
.
Usually
when
*NL*
the
Un-Dead
sleep
at
home
''
--
as
he
spoke
he
made
a
comprehensive
sweep
of
*NL*
his
arm
to
designate
what
to
a
vampire
was
``
home
''
--
``
their
face
show
what
*NL*
they
are
,
but
this
so
sweet
that
was
when
she
not
Un-Dead
she
go
back
to
*NL*
the
nothings
of
the
common
dead
.
There
is
no
malign
there
,
see
,
and
so
*NL*
it
make
hard
that
I
must
kill
her
in
her
sleep
.
''
This
turned
my
blood
*NL*
cold
,
and
it
began
to
dawn
upon
me
that
I
was
accepting
Van
Helsing
's
*NL*
theories
;
but
if
she
were
really
dead
,
what
was
there
of
terror
in
the
*NL*
idea
of
killing
her
?
He
looked
up
at
me
,
and
evidently
saw
the
change
in
*NL*
my
face
,
for
he
said
almost
joyously
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
believe
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
:
``
Do
not
press
me
too
hard
all
at
once
.
I
am
willing
to
*NL*
accept
.
How
will
you
do
this
bloody
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
cut
off
her
head
and
fill
her
mouth
with
garlic
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
drive
a
stake
through
her
body
.
''
It
made
me
shudder
to
think
of
so
*NL*
mutilating
the
body
of
the
woman
whom
I
had
loved
.
And
yet
the
feeling
*NL*
was
not
so
strong
as
I
had
expected
.
I
was
,
in
fact
,
beginning
to
*NL*
shudder
at
the
presence
of
this
being
,
this
Un-Dead
,
as
Van
Helsing
*NL*
called
it
,
and
to
loathe
it
.
Is
it
possible
that
love
is
all
subjective
,
*NL*
or
all
objective
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
a
considerable
time
for
Van
Helsing
to
begin
,
but
he
stood
as
*NL*
if
wrapped
in
thought
.
Presently
he
closed
the
catch
of
his
bag
with
a
*NL*
snap
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
,
and
have
made
up
my
mind
as
to
what
is
best
.
If
I
*NL*
did
simply
follow
my
inclining
I
would
do
now
,
at
this
moment
,
what
is
*NL*
to
be
done
;
but
there
are
other
things
to
follow
,
and
things
that
are
*NL*
thousand
times
more
difficult
in
that
them
we
do
not
know
.
This
is
*NL*
simple
.
She
have
yet
no
life
taken
,
though
that
is
of
time
;
and
to
act
*NL*
now
would
be
to
take
danger
from
her
for
ever
.
But
then
we
may
have
to
*NL*
want
Arthur
,
and
how
shall
we
tell
him
of
this
?
If
you
,
who
saw
the
*NL*
wounds
on
Lucy
's
throat
,
and
saw
the
wounds
so
similar
on
the
child
's
at
*NL*
the
hospital
;
if
you
,
who
saw
the
coffin
empty
last
night
and
full
*NL*
to-day
with
a
woman
who
have
not
change
only
to
be
more
rose
and
more
*NL*
beautiful
in
a
whole
week
,
after
she
die
--
if
you
know
of
this
and
know
*NL*
of
the
white
figure
last
night
that
brought
the
child
to
the
churchyard
,
*NL*
and
yet
of
your
own
senses
you
did
not
believe
,
how
,
then
,
can
I
expect
*NL*
Arthur
,
who
know
none
of
those
things
,
to
believe
?
He
doubted
me
when
I
*NL*
took
him
from
her
kiss
when
she
was
dying
.
I
know
he
has
forgiven
me
*NL*
because
in
some
mistaken
idea
I
have
done
things
that
prevent
him
say
*NL*
good-bye
as
he
ought
;
and
he
may
think
that
in
some
more
mistaken
idea
*NL*
this
woman
was
buried
alive
;
and
that
in
most
mistake
of
all
we
have
*NL*
killed
her
.
He
will
then
argue
back
that
it
is
we
,
mistaken
ones
,
that
*NL*
have
killed
her
by
our
ideas
;
and
so
he
will
be
much
unhappy
always
.
Yet
*NL*
he
never
can
be
sure
;
and
that
is
the
worst
of
all
.
And
he
will
*NL*
sometimes
think
that
she
he
loved
was
buried
alive
,
and
that
will
paint
*NL*
his
dreams
with
horrors
of
what
she
must
have
suffered
;
and
again
,
he
*NL*
will
think
that
we
may
be
right
,
and
that
his
so
beloved
was
,
after
all
,
*NL*
an
Un-Dead
.
No
!
I
told
him
once
,
and
since
then
I
learn
much
.
Now
,
since
*NL*
I
know
it
is
all
true
,
a
hundred
thousand
times
more
do
I
know
that
he
*NL*
must
pass
through
the
bitter
waters
to
reach
the
sweet
.
He
,
poor
fellow
,
*NL*
must
have
one
hour
that
will
make
the
very
face
of
heaven
grow
black
to
*NL*
him
;
then
we
can
act
for
good
all
round
and
send
him
peace
.
My
mind
is
*NL*
made
up
.
Let
us
go
.
You
return
home
for
to-night
to
your
asylum
,
and
see
*NL*
that
all
be
well
.
As
for
me
,
I
shall
spend
the
night
here
in
this
*NL*
churchyard
in
my
own
way
.
To-morrow
night
you
will
come
to
me
to
the
*NL*
Berkeley
Hotel
at
ten
of
the
clock
.
I
shall
send
for
Arthur
to
come
too
,
*NL*
and
also
that
so
fine
young
man
of
America
that
gave
his
blood
.
Later
we
*NL*
shall
all
have
work
to
do
.
I
come
with
you
so
far
as
Piccadilly
and
*NL*
there
dine
,
for
I
must
be
back
here
before
the
sun
set
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
locked
the
tomb
and
came
away
,
and
got
over
the
wall
of
the
*NL*
churchyard
,
which
was
not
much
of
a
task
,
and
drove
back
to
Piccadilly
.

I

It

to-night

that
so

garlic

so
seal
up
the
door

She
is
young

will
heed

Moreover

these
are
only
to
prevent
her
coming
out

they

on
her

*NL*
Lucy
or
from
her
,
I
have
no
fear
;
but
that
other
to
whom
is
there
that
*NL*
she
is
Un-Dead
,
he
have
now
the
power
to
seek
her
tomb
and
find
shelter
.
*NL*
He
is
cunning
,
as
I
know
from
Mr.
Jonathan
and
from
the
way
that
all
*NL*
along
he
have
fooled
us
when
he
played
with
us
for
Miss
Lucy
's
life
,
and
*NL*
we
lost
;
and
in
many
ways
the
Un-Dead
are
strong
.
He
have
always
the
*NL*
strength
in
his
hand
of
twenty
men
;
even
we
four
who
gave
our
strength
*NL*
to
Miss
Lucy
it
also
is
all
to
him
.
Besides
,
he
can
summon
his
wolf
and
*NL*
I
know
not
what
.
So
if
it
be
that
he
come
thither
on
this
night
he
shall
*NL*
find
me
;
but
none
other
shall
--
until
it
be
too
late
.
But
it
may
be
that
*NL*
he
will
not
attempt
the
place
.
There
is
no
reason
why
he
should
;
his
*NL*
hunting
ground
is
more
full
of
game
than
the
churchyard
where
the
*NL*
Un-Dead
woman
sleep
,
and
the
one
old
man
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
I
write
this
in
case
...
Take
the
papers
that
are
with
this
,
*NL*
the
diaries
of
Harker
and
the
rest
,
and
read
them
,
and
then
find
this
*NL*
great
Un-Dead
,
and
cut
off
his
head
and
burn
his
heart
or
drive
a
stake
*NL*
through
it
,
so
that
the
world
may
rest
from
him

it

--
It
is
wonderful
what
a
good
night
's
sleep
will
do
for
*NL*
one
.
Yesterday
I
was
almost
willing
to
accept
Van
Helsing
's
monstrous
*NL*
ideas
;
but
now
they
seem
to
start
out
lurid
before
me
as
outrages
on
*NL*
common
sense
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
believes
it
all
.
I
wonder
if
his
*NL*
mind
can
have
become
in
any
way
unhinged
.
Surely
there
must
be
_
some
_
*NL*
rational
explanation
of
all
these
mysterious
things
.
Is
it
possible
that
*NL*
the
Professor
can
have
done
it
himself
?
He
is
so
abnormally
clever
that
*NL*
if
he
went
off
his
head
he
would
carry
out
his
intent
with
regard
to
*NL*
some
fixed
idea
in
a
wonderful
way
.
I
am
loath
to
think
it
,
and
indeed
*NL*
it
would
be
almost
as
great
a
marvel
as
the
other
to
find
that
Van
*NL*
Helsing
was
mad
;
but
anyhow
I
shall
watch
him
carefully
.
I
may
get
some
*NL*
light
on
the
mystery
.

29
September

morning

...
Last
night
,
at
a
little
before
ten
o'clock
,
*NL*
Arthur
and
Quincey
came
into
Van
Helsing
's
room
;
he
told
us
all
that
he
*NL*
wanted
us
to
do
,
but
especially
addressing
himself
to
Arthur
,
as
if
all
*NL*
our
wills
were
centred
in
his
.
He
began
by
saying
that
he
hoped
we
would
*NL*
all
come
with
him
too
,
``
for
,
''
he
said
,
``
there
is
a
grave
duty
to
be
done
*NL*
there
.
You
were
doubtless
surprised
at
my
letter
?
''
This
query
was
*NL*
directly
addressed
to
Lord
Godalming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
.
It
rather
upset
me
for
a
bit
.
There
has
been
so
much
trouble
*NL*
around
my
house
of
late
that
I
could
do
without
any
more
.
I
have
been
*NL*
curious
,
too
,
as
to
what
you
mean
.
Quincey
and
I
talked
it
over
;
but
the
*NL*
more
we
talked
,
the
more
puzzled
we
got
,
till
now
I
can
say
for
myself
*NL*
that
I
'm
about
up
a
tree
as
to
any
meaning
about
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
too
,
''
said
Quincey
Morris
laconically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
Professor
,
``
then
you
are
nearer
the
beginning
,
both
of
*NL*
you
,
than
friend
John
here
,
who
has
to
go
a
long
way
back
before
he
can
*NL*
even
get
so
far
as
to
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
he
recognised
my
return
to
my
old
doubting
frame
of
*NL*
mind
without
my
saying
a
word
.
Then
,
turning
to
the
other
two
,
he
said
*NL*
with
intense
gravity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
your
permission
to
do
what
I
think
good
this
night
.
It
is
,
I
*NL*
know
,
much
to
ask
;
and
when
you
know
what
it
is
I
propose
to
do
you
will
*NL*
know
,
and
only
then
,
how
much
.
Therefore
may
I
ask
that
you
promise
me
*NL*
in
the
dark
,
so
that
afterwards
,
though
you
may
be
angry
with
me
for
a
*NL*
time
--
I
must
not
disguise
from
myself
the
possibility
that
such
may
*NL*
be
--
you
shall
not
blame
yourselves
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
frank
anyhow
,
''
broke
in
Quincey
.
``
I
'll
answer
for
the
Professor
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
quite
see
his
drift
,
but
I
swear
he
's
honest
;
and
that
's
good
*NL*
enough
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Van
Helsing
proudly
.
``
I
have
done
myself
the
*NL*
honour
of
counting
you
one
trusting
friend
,
and
such
endorsement
is
dear
*NL*
to
me
.
''
He
held
out
a
hand
,
which
Quincey
took
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Arthur
spoke
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
I
do
n't
quite
like
to
`
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke
,
'
as
they
*NL*
say
in
Scotland
,
and
if
it
be
anything
in
which
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
*NL*
or
my
faith
as
a
Christian
is
concerned
,
I
can
not
make
such
a
promise
.
*NL*
If
you
can
assure
me
that
what
you
intend
does
not
violate
either
of
*NL*
these
two
,
then
I
give
my
consent
at
once
;
though
for
the
life
of
me
,
I
*NL*
can
not
understand
what
you
are
driving
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
accept
your
limitation
,
''
said
Van
Helsing
,
``
and
all
I
ask
of
you
is
*NL*
that
if
you
feel
it
necessary
to
condemn
any
act
of
mine
,
you
will
first
*NL*
consider
it
well
and
be
satisfied
that
it
does
not
violate
your
*NL*
reservations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreed
!
''
said
Arthur
;
``
that
is
only
fair
.
And
now
that
the
*NL*
_
pourparlers
_
are
over
,
may
I
ask
what
it
is
we
are
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
come
with
me
,
and
to
come
in
secret
,
to
the
churchyard
at
*NL*
Kingstead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
's
face
fell
as
he
said
in
an
amazed
sort
of
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
poor
Lucy
is
buried
?
''
The
Professor
bowed
.
Arthur
went
on
:
``
And
*NL*
when
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
enter
the
tomb
!
''
Arthur
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Professor
,
are
you
in
earnest
;
or
it
is
some
monstrous
joke
?
Pardon
me
,
*NL*
I
see
that
you
are
in
earnest
.
''
He
sat
down
again
,
but
I
could
see
that
*NL*
he
sat
firmly
and
proudly
,
as
one
who
is
on
his
dignity
.
There
was
*NL*
silence
until
he
asked
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
in
the
tomb
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
open
the
coffin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
too
much
!
''
he
said
,
angrily
rising
again
.
``
I
am
willing
to
be
*NL*
patient
in
all
things
that
are
reasonable
;
but
in
this
--
this
desecration
*NL*
of
the
grave
--
of
one
who
--
''
He
fairly
choked
with
indignation
.
The
*NL*
Professor
looked
pityingly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
spare
you
one
pang
,
my
poor
friend
,
''
he
said
,
``
God
knows
I
*NL*
would
.
But
this
night
our
feet
must
tread
in
thorny
paths
;
or
later
,
and
*NL*
for
ever
,
the
feet
you
love
must
walk
in
paths
of
flame
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
looked
up
with
set
white
face
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
sir
,
take
care
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
not
be
well
to
hear
what
I
have
to
say
?

said
Van
Helsing
.
*NL*
``
And
then
you
will
at
least
know
the
limit
of
my
purpose

Shall
I
go
*NL*
on
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
fair
enough

broke
in
Morris
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
Van
Helsing
went
on
,
evidently
with
an
effort
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Lucy
is
dead
;
is
it
not
so
?
Yes
!
Then
there
can
be
no
wrong
to
*NL*
her
.
But
if
she
be
not
dead
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
jumped
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
he
cried
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
Has
there
been
any
mistake
;
has
*NL*
she
been
buried
alive
?
''
He
groaned
in
anguish
that
not
even
hope
could
*NL*
soften
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
say
she
was
alive

my
child

I
did
not
think
it

I
go
no
*NL*
further
than
to
say
that
she
might
be
Un-Dead

*NL*
``
Un-Dead

Not
alive

What
do

Is
this
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
mysteries

Believe

we
are
now
on

verge

But
*NL*
I
have
not

cried
Arthur
in

passion

``
Not

you
try

*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
rose
up
from
where
he
had
all
the
time
been
seated
,
and
*NL*
said
,
gravely
and
sternly
:

by

I
shall
do

All
I
ask
you
*NL*
now
is
that
you
come
with
me

that
you
look

listen

and
if
when

later
I
make
the

request
you
do
not
be
more
eager
for
its

fulfilment

than
I
am

shall
do

it
*NL*
may
seem

And
then
,
to
follow
of
your
Lordship

I
shall
*NL*
hold
myself
at
your
disposal
to
render
an
account
to
you
,
when
and
where
*NL*
you
will

''
His
voice
broke
a
little
,
and
he
went
on
with
a
voice
full
of
*NL*
pity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
I
beseech
you
,
do
not
go
forth
in
anger
with

In

acts
which
were
often
not

to
do

and
which
sometimes
did
wring

I
have
never

so
heavy
a
task
as
now

Believe
me
that
if
*NL*
the
time
comes
for

to
change
your
mind
towards

one
look
from
*NL*
you
will
wipe
away
all
this
so
sad
hour
,
for
I
would
do
what
a
man
can
*NL*
to
save
you
from
sorrow

Just
think
.
For
why
should
I
give
myself
so
*NL*
much
of
labour
and
so
much
of
sorrow
?
I
have
come
here
from
my
own
land
*NL*
to
do
what
I
can
of
good
;
at
the
first
to
please
my
friend
John
,
and
*NL*
then
to
help
a
sweet
young
lady
,
whom
,
too
,
I
came
to
love
.
For
her
--
I
*NL*
am
ashamed
to
say
so
much
,
but
I
say
it
in
kindness
--
I
gave
what
you
*NL*
gave
;
the
blood
of
my
veins
;
I
gave
it
,
I
,
who
was
not
,
like
you
,
her
*NL*
lover
,
but
only
her
physician
and
her
friend
.
I
gave
to
her
my
nights
*NL*
and
days
--
before
death
,
after
death
;
and
if
my
death
can
do
her
good
*NL*
even
now
,
when
she
is
the
dead
Un-Dead
,
she
shall
have
it
freely
.

He
*NL*
said
this
with
a
very
grave
,
sweet
pride
,
and
Arthur
was
much
affected
*NL*
by
it
.
He
took
the
old
man
's
hand
and
said
in
a
broken
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
hard
to
think
of
it
,
and
I
can
not
understand

but
at

I

shall
go
with
you
and
wait

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
DR.
SEWARD
'S
DIARY
--
_
continued
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
a
quarter
before
twelve
o'clock
when
we
got
into
the
*NL*
churchyard
over
the
low
wall
.
The
night
was
dark
with
occasional
gleams
*NL*
of
moonlight
between
the
rents
of
the
heavy
clouds
that
scudded
across
*NL*
the
sky
.
We
all
kept
somehow
close
together
,
with
Van
Helsing
slightly
*NL*
in
front
as
he
led
the
way
.
When
we
had
come
close
to
the
tomb
I
looked
*NL*
well
at
Arthur
,
for
I
feared
that
the
proximity
to
a
place
laden
with
so
*NL*
sorrowful
a
memory
would
upset
him
;
but
he
bore
himself
well
.
I
took
it
*NL*
that
the
very
mystery
of
the
proceeding
was
in
some
way
a
counteractant
*NL*
to
his
grief
.
The
Professor
unlocked
the
door
,
and
seeing
a
natural
*NL*
hesitation
amongst
us
for
various
reasons
,
solved
the
difficulty
by
*NL*
entering
first
himself
.
The
rest
of
us
followed
,
and
he
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
He
then
lit
a
dark
lantern
and
pointed
to
the
coffin
.
Arthur
stepped
*NL*
forward
hesitatingly
;
Van
Helsing
said
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
with
me
here
yesterday
.
Was
the
body
of
Miss
Lucy
in
that
*NL*
coffin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
.
''
The
Professor
turned
to
the
rest
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
;
and
yet
there
is
no
one
who
does
not
believe
with
me
.
''
He
*NL*
took
his
screwdriver
and
again
took
off
the
lid
of
the
coffin
.
Arthur
*NL*
looked
on
,
very
pale
but
silent
;
when
the
lid
was
removed
he
stepped
*NL*
forward
.
He
evidently
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
leaden
coffin
,
or
,
*NL*
at
any
rate
,
had
not
thought
of
it
.
When
he
saw
the
rent
in
the
lead
,
*NL*
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
for
an
instant
,
but
as
quickly
fell
away
*NL*
again
,
so
that
he
remained
of
a
ghastly
whiteness
;
he
was
still
silent
.
*NL*
Van
Helsing
forced
back
the
leaden
flange
,
and
we
all
looked
in
and
*NL*
recoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coffin
was
empty
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
minutes
no
one
spoke
a
word
.
The
silence
was
broken
by
*NL*
Quincey
Morris
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Professor
,
I
answered
for
you
.
Your
word
is
all
I
want
.
I
would
n't
ask
*NL*
such
a
thing
ordinarily
--
I
would
n't
so
dishonour
you
as
to
imply
a
*NL*
doubt
;
but
this
is
a
mystery
that
goes
beyond
any
honour
or
dishonour
.
*NL*
Is
this
your
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
to
you
by
all
that
I
hold
sacred
that
I
have
not
removed
nor
*NL*
touched
her
.
What
happened
was
this
:
Two
nights
ago
my
friend
Seward
and
*NL*
I
came
here
--
with
good
purpose
,
believe
me
.
I
opened
that
coffin
,
which
*NL*
was
then
sealed
up
,
and
we
found
it
,
as
now
,
empty
.
We
then
waited
,
and
*NL*
saw
something
white
come
through
the
trees
.
The
next
day
we
came
here
in
*NL*
day-time
,
and
she
lay
there
.
Did
she
not
,
friend
John
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
night
we
were
just
in
time
.
One
more
so
small
child
was
missing
,
*NL*
and
we
find
it
,
thank
God
,
unharmed
amongst
the
graves
.
Yesterday
I
came
*NL*
here
before
sundown
,
for
at
sundown
the
Un-Dead
can
move
.
I
waited
here
*NL*
all
the
night
till
the
sun
rose
,
but
I
saw
nothing
.
It
was
most
probable
*NL*
that
it
was
because
I
had
laid
over
the
clamps
of
those
doors
garlic
,
*NL*
which
the
Un-Dead
can
not
bear
,
and
other
things
which
they
shun
.
Last
*NL*
night
there
was
no
exodus
,
so
to-night
before
the
sundown
I
took
away
my
*NL*
garlic
and
other
things
.
And
so
it
is
we
find
this
coffin
empty
.
But
*NL*
bear
with
me
.
So
far
there
is
much
that
is
strange
.
Wait
you
with
me
*NL*
outside
,
unseen
and
unheard
,
and
things
much
stranger
are
yet
to
be
.
*NL*
So
''
--
here
he
shut
the
dark
slide
of
his
lantern
--
``
now
to
the
outside
.
''
*NL*
He
opened
the
door
,
and
we
filed
out
,
he
coming
last
and
locking
the
*NL*
door
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
but
it
seemed
fresh
and
pure
in
the
night
air
after
the
terror
of
*NL*
that
vault
.
How
sweet
it
was
to
see
the
clouds
race
by
,
and
the
passing
*NL*
gleams
of
the
moonlight
between
the
scudding
clouds
crossing
and
*NL*
passing
--
like
the
gladness
and
sorrow
of
a
man
's
life
;
how
sweet
it
was
*NL*
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
,
that
had
no
taint
of
death
and
decay
;
how
*NL*
humanising
to
see
the
red
lighting
of
the
sky
beyond
the
hill
,
and
to
*NL*
hear
far
away
the
muffled
roar
that
marks
the
life
of
a
great
city
.
Each
*NL*
in
his
own
way
was
solemn
and
overcome
.
Arthur
was
silent
,
and
was
,
I
*NL*
could
see
,
striving
to
grasp
the
purpose
and
the
inner
meaning
of
the
*NL*
mystery
.
I
was
myself
tolerably
patient
,
and
half
inclined
again
to
*NL*
throw
aside
doubt
and
to
accept
Van
Helsing
's
conclusions
.
Quincey
*NL*
Morris
was
phlegmatic
in
the
way
of
a
man
who
accepts
all
things
,
and
*NL*
accepts
them
in
the
spirit
of
cool
bravery
,
with
hazard
of
all
he
has
to
*NL*
stake
.
Not
being
able
to
smoke
,
he
cut
himself
a
good-sized
plug
of
*NL*
tobacco
and
began
to
chew
.
As
to
Van
Helsing
,
he
was
employed
in
a
*NL*
definite
way
.
First
he
took
from
his
bag
a
mass
of
what
looked
like
*NL*
thin
,
wafer-like
biscuit
,
which
was
carefully
rolled
up
in
a
white
*NL*
napkin
;
next
he
took
out
a
double-handful
of
some
whitish
stuff
,
like
*NL*
dough
or
putty
.
He
crumbled
the
wafer
up
fine
and
worked
it
into
the
*NL*
mass
between
his
hands
.
This
he
then
took
,
and
rolling
it
into
thin
*NL*
strips
,
began
to
lay
them
into
the
crevices
between
the
door
and
its
*NL*
setting
in
the
tomb
.
I
was
somewhat
puzzled
at
this
,
and
being
close
,
*NL*
asked
him
what
it
was
that
he
was
doing
.
Arthur
and
Quincey
drew
near
*NL*
also
,
as
they
too
were
curious
.
He
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
closing
the
tomb
,
so
that
the
Un-Dead
may
not
enter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
that
stuff
you
have
put
there
going
to
do
it
?
''
asked
Quincey
.
*NL*
``
Great
Scott
!
Is
this
a
game
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
which
you
are
using
?
''
This
time
the
question
was
by
*NL*
Arthur
.
Van
Helsing
reverently
lifted
his
hat
as
he
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Host
.
I
brought
it
from
Amsterdam
.
I
have
an
Indulgence
.
''
It
was
an
*NL*
answer
that
appalled
the
most
sceptical
of
us
,
and
we
felt
individually
*NL*
that
in
the
presence
of
such
earnest
purpose
as
the
Professor
's
,
a
*NL*
purpose
which
could
thus
use
the
to
him
most
sacred
of
things
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
distrust
.
In
respectful
silence
we
took
the
places
*NL*
assigned
to
us
close
round
the
tomb
,
but
hidden
from
the
sight
of
any
*NL*
one
approaching
.
I
pitied
the
others
,
especially
Arthur
.
I
had
myself
*NL*
been
apprenticed
by
my
former
visits
to
this
watching
horror
;
and
yet
I
,
*NL*
who
had
up
to
an
hour
ago
repudiated
the
proofs
,
felt
my
heart
sink
*NL*
within
me
.
Never
did
tombs
look
so
ghastly
white
;
never
did
cypress
,
or
*NL*
yew
,
or
juniper
so
seem
the
embodiment
of
funereal
gloom
;
never
did
tree
*NL*
or
grass
wave
or
rustle
so
ominously
;
never
did
bough
creak
so
*NL*
mysteriously
;
and
never
did
the
far-away
howling
of
dogs
send
such
a
*NL*
woeful
presage
through
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
spell
of
silence
,
a
big
,
aching
void
,
and
then
from
the
*NL*
Professor
a
keen
``
S-s-s-s
!
''
He
pointed
;
and
far
down
the
avenue
of
yews
*NL*
we
saw
a
white
figure
advance
--
a
dim
white
figure
,
which
held
something
*NL*
dark
at
its
breast
.
The
figure
stopped
,
and
at
the
moment
a
ray
of
*NL*
moonlight
fell
upon
the
masses
of
driving
clouds
and
showed
in
startling
*NL*
prominence
a
dark-haired
woman
,
dressed
in
the
cerements
of
the
grave
.
*NL*
We
could
not
see
the
face
,
for
it
was
bent
down
over
what
we
saw
to
be
a
*NL*
fair-haired
child
.
There
was
a
pause
and
a
sharp
little
cry
,
such
as
a
*NL*
child
gives
in
sleep
,
or
a
dog
as
it
lies
before
the
fire
and
dreams
.
We
*NL*
were
starting
forward
,
but
the
Professor
's
warning
hand
,
seen
by
us
as
*NL*
he
stood
behind
a
yew-tree
,
kept
us
back
;
and
then
as
we
looked
the
*NL*
white
figure
moved
forwards
again
.
It
was
now
near
enough
for
us
to
see
*NL*
clearly
,
and
the
moonlight
still
held
.
My
own
heart
grew
cold
as
ice
,
*NL*
and
I
could
hear
the
gasp
of
Arthur
,
as
we
recognised
the
features
of
*NL*
Lucy
Westenra
.
Lucy
Westenra
,
but
yet
how
changed
.
The
sweetness
was
*NL*
turned
to
adamantine
,
heartless
cruelty
,
and
the
purity
to
voluptuous
*NL*
wantonness
.
Van
Helsing
stepped
out
,
and
,
obedient
to
his
gesture
,
we
*NL*
all
advanced
too
;
the
four
of
us
ranged
in
a
line
before
the
door
of
the
*NL*
tomb
.
Van
Helsing
raised
his
lantern
and
drew
the
slide
;
by
the
*NL*
concentrated
light
that
fell
on
Lucy
's
face
we
could
see
that
the
lips
*NL*
were
crimson
with
fresh
blood
,
and
that
the
stream
had
trickled
over
her
*NL*
chin
and
stained
the
purity
of
her
lawn
death-robe
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shuddered
with
horror
.
I
could
see
by
the
tremulous
light
that
even
*NL*
Van
Helsing
's
iron
nerve
had
failed
.
Arthur
was
next
to
me
,
and
if
I
had
*NL*
not
seized
his
arm
and
held
him
up
,
he
would
have
fallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lucy
--
I
call
the
thing
that
was
before
us
Lucy
because
it
bore
her
*NL*
shape
--
saw
us
she
drew
back
with
an
angry
snarl
,
such
as
a
cat
gives
*NL*
when
taken
unawares
;
then
her
eyes
ranged
over
us
.
Lucy
's
eyes
in
form
*NL*
and
colour
;
but
Lucy
's
eyes
unclean
and
full
of
hell-fire
,
instead
of
*NL*
the
pure
,
gentle
orbs
we
knew
.
At
that
moment
the
remnant
of
my
love
*NL*
passed
into
hate
and
loathing
;
had
she
then
to
be
killed
,
I
could
have
*NL*
done
it
with
savage
delight
.
As
she
looked
,
her
eyes
blazed
with
unholy
*NL*
light
,
and
the
face
became
wreathed
with
a
voluptuous
smile
.
Oh
,
God
,
*NL*
how
it
made
me
shudder
to
see
it
!
With
a
careless
motion
,
she
flung
to
*NL*
the
ground
,
callous
as
a
devil
,
the
child
that
up
to
now
she
had
*NL*
clutched
strenuously
to
her
breast
,
growling
over
it
as
a
dog
growls
*NL*
over
a
bone
.
The
child
gave
a
sharp
cry
,
and
lay
there
moaning
.
There
*NL*
was
a
cold-bloodedness
in
the
act
which
wrung
a
groan
from
Arthur
;
when
*NL*
she
advanced
to
him
with
outstretched
arms
and
a
wanton
smile
he
fell
*NL*
back
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
still
advanced
,
however
,
and
with
a
languorous
,
voluptuous
grace
,
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
me
,
Arthur
.
Leave
these
others
and
come
to
me
.
My
arms
are
*NL*
hungry
for
you
.
Come
,
and
we
can
rest
together
.
Come
,
my
husband
,
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
diabolically
sweet
in
her
tones
--
something
of
the
*NL*
tingling
of
glass
when
struck
--
which
rang
through
the
brains
even
of
us
*NL*
who
heard
the
words
addressed
to
another
.
As
for
Arthur
,
he
seemed
under
*NL*
a
spell
;
moving
his
hands
from
his
face
,
he
opened
wide
his
arms
.
She
*NL*
was
leaping
for
them
,
when
Van
Helsing
sprang
forward
and
held
between
*NL*
them
his
little
golden
crucifix
.
She
recoiled
from
it
,
and
,
with
a
*NL*
suddenly
distorted
face
,
full
of
rage
,
dashed
past
him
as
if
to
enter
*NL*
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
door
,
however
,
she
stopped
,
as
if
*NL*
arrested
by
some
irresistible
force
.
Then
she
turned
,
and
her
face
was
*NL*
shown
in
the
clear
burst
of
moonlight
and
by
the
lamp
,
which
had
now
no
*NL*
quiver
from
Van
Helsing
's
iron
nerves
.
Never
did
I
see
such
baffled
*NL*
malice
on
a
face
;
and
never
,
I
trust
,
shall
such
ever
be
seen
again
by
*NL*
mortal
eyes
.
The
beautiful
colour
became
livid
,
the
eyes
seemed
to
throw
*NL*
out
sparks
of
hell-fire
,
the
brows
were
wrinkled
as
though
the
folds
of
*NL*
the
flesh
were
the
coils
of
Medusa
's
snakes
,
and
the
lovely
,
*NL*
blood-stained
mouth
grew
to
an
open
square
,
as
in
the
passion
masks
of
*NL*
the
Greeks
and
Japanese
.
If
ever
a
face
meant
death
--
if
looks
could
*NL*
kill
--
we
saw
it
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
for
full
half
a
minute
,
which
seemed
an
eternity
,
she
remained
*NL*
between
the
lifted
crucifix
and
the
sacred
closing
of
her
means
of
*NL*
entry
.
Van
Helsing
broke
the
silence
by
asking
Arthur
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
me
,
oh
my
friend
!
Am
I
to
proceed
in
my
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
threw
himself
on
his
knees
,
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
,
as
he
*NL*
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
you
will
,
friend
;
do
as
you
will
.
There
can
be
no
horror
like
*NL*
this
ever
any
more
;
''
and
he
groaned
in
spirit
.
Quincey
and
I
*NL*
simultaneously
moved
towards
him
,
and
took
his
arms
.
We
could
hear
the
*NL*
click
of
the
closing
lantern
as
Van
Helsing
held
it
down
;
coming
close
*NL*
to
the
tomb
,
he
began
to
remove
from
the
chinks
some
of
the
sacred
*NL*
emblem
which
he
had
placed
there
.
We
all
looked
on
in
horrified
*NL*
amazement
as
we
saw
,
when
he
stood
back
,
the
woman
,
with
a
corporeal
*NL*
body
as
real
at
that
moment
as
our
own
,
pass
in
through
the
interstice
*NL*
where
scarce
a
knife-blade
could
have
gone
.
We
all
felt
a
glad
sense
of
*NL*
relief
when
we
saw
the
Professor
calmly
restoring
the
strings
of
putty
*NL*
to
the
edges
of
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
was
done
,
he
lifted
the
child
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
my
friends
;
we
can
do
no
more
till
to-morrow
.
There
is
a
*NL*
funeral
at
noon
,
so
here
we
shall
all
come
before
long
after
that
.
The
*NL*
friends
of
the
dead
will
all
be
gone
by
two
,
and
when
the
sexton
lock
*NL*
the
gate
we
shall
remain
.
Then
there
is
more
to
do
;
but
not
like
this
of
*NL*
to-night
.
As
for
this
little
one
,
he
is
not
much
harm
,
and
by
to-morrow
*NL*
night
he
shall
be
well
.
We
shall
leave
him
where
the
police
will
find
*NL*
him
,
as
on
the
other
night
;
and
then
to
home
.
''
Coming
close
to
Arthur
,
*NL*
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
Arthur
,
you
have
had
a
sore
trial
;
but
after
,
when
you
look
*NL*
back
,
you
will
see
how
it
was
necessary
.
You
are
now
in
the
bitter
*NL*
waters
,
my
child
.
By
this
time
to-morrow
you
will
,
please
God
,
have
*NL*
passed
them
,
and
have
drunk
of
the
sweet
waters
;
so
do
not
mourn
*NL*
overmuch
.
Till
then
I
shall
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
and
Quincey
came
home
with
me
,
and
we
tried
to
cheer
each
other
*NL*
on
the
way
.
We
had
left
the
child
in
safety
,
and
were
tired
;
so
we
all
*NL*
slept
with
more
or
less
reality
of
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*

*
*
*NL*
*NL*
_
29
September
,
night
.
_
--
A
little
before
twelve
o'clock
we
three
--
Arthur
,
*NL*
Quincey
Morris
,
and
myself
--
called
for
the
Professor
.
It
was
odd
to
*NL*
notice
that
by
common
consent
we
had
all
put
on
black
clothes
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
Arthur
wore
black
,
for
he
was
in
deep
mourning
,
but
the
rest
of
*NL*
us
wore
it
by
instinct
.
We
got
to
the
churchyard
by
half-past
one
,
and
*NL*
strolled
about
,
keeping
out
of
official
observation
,
so
that
when
the
*NL*
gravediggers
had
completed
their
task
and
the
sexton
under
the
belief
*NL*
that
every
one
had
gone
,
had
locked
the
gate
,
we
had
the
place
all
to
*NL*
ourselves
.
Van
Helsing
,
instead
of
his
little
black
bag
,
had
with
him
a
*NL*
long
leather
one
,
something
like
a
cricketing
bag
;
it
was
manifestly
of
*NL*
fair
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
alone
and
had
heard
the
last
of
the
footsteps
die
out
up
*NL*
the
road
,
we
silently
,
and
as
if
by
ordered
intention
,
followed
the
*NL*
Professor
to
the
tomb
.
He
unlocked
the
door
,
and
we
entered
,
closing
it
*NL*
behind
us
.
Then
he
took
from
his
bag
the
lantern
,
which
he
lit
,
and
also
*NL*
two
wax
candles
,
which
,
when
lighted
,
he
stuck
,
by
melting
their
own
*NL*
ends
,
on
other
coffins
,
so
that
they
might
give
light
sufficient
to
work
*NL*
by
.
When
he
again
lifted
the
lid
off
Lucy
's
coffin
we
all
looked
--
Arthur
*NL*
trembling
like
an
aspen
--
and
saw
that
the
body
lay
there
in
all
its
*NL*
death-beauty
.
But
there
was
no
love
in
my
own
heart
,
nothing
but
*NL*
loathing
for
the
foul
Thing
which
had
taken
Lucy
's
shape
without
her
*NL*
soul
.
I
could
see
even
Arthur
's
face
grow
hard
as
he
looked
.
Presently
*NL*
he
said
to
Van
Helsing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
really
Lucy
's
body
,
or
only
a
demon
in
her
shape
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
her
body
,
and
yet
not
it
.
But
wait
a
while
,
and
you
all
see
her
*NL*
as
she
was
,
and
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
like
a
nightmare
of
Lucy
as
she
lay
there
;
the
pointed
teeth
,
*NL*
the
bloodstained
,
voluptuous
mouth
--
which
it
made
one
shudder
to
*NL*
see
--
the
whole
carnal
and
unspiritual
appearance
,
seeming
like
a
*NL*
devilish
mockery
of
Lucy
's
sweet
purity
.
Van
Helsing
,
with
his
usual
*NL*
methodicalness
,
began
taking
the
various
contents
from
his
bag
and
*NL*
placing
them
ready
for
use
.
First
he
took
out
a
soldering
iron
and
some
*NL*
plumbing
solder
,
and
then
a
small
oil-lamp
,
which
gave
out
,
when
lit
in
*NL*
a
corner
of
the
tomb
,
gas
which
burned
at
fierce
heat
with
a
blue
*NL*
flame
;
then
his
operating
knives
,
which
he
placed
to
hand
;
and
last
a
*NL*
round
wooden
stake
,
some
two
and
a
half
or
three
inches
thick
and
about
*NL*
three
feet
long
.
One
end
of
it
was
hardened
by
charring
in
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
was
sharpened
to
a
fine
point
.
With
this
stake
came
a
heavy
hammer
,
such
*NL*
as
in
households
is
used
in
the
coal-cellar
for
breaking
the
lumps
.
To
*NL*
me
,
a
doctor
's
preparations
for
work
of
any
kind
are
stimulating
and
*NL*
bracing
,
but
the
effect
of
these
things
on
both
Arthur
and
Quincey
was
*NL*
to
cause
them
a
sort
of
consternation
.
They
both
,
however
,
kept
their
*NL*
courage
,
and
remained
silent
and
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
all
was
ready
,
Van
Helsing
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
we
do
anything
,
let
me
tell
you
this
;
it
is
out
of
the
lore
and
*NL*
experience
of
the
ancients
and
of
all
those
who
have
studied
the
powers
*NL*
of
the
Un-Dead
.
When
they
become
such
,
there
comes
with
the
change
the
*NL*
curse
of
immortality
;
they
can
not
die
,
but
must
go
on
age
after
age
*NL*
adding
new
victims
and
multiplying
the
evils
of
the
world
;
for
all
that
*NL*
die
from
the
preying
of
the
Un-Dead
becomes
themselves
Un-Dead
,
and
prey
*NL*
on
their
kind
.
And
so
the
circle
goes
on
ever
widening
,
like
as
the
*NL*
ripples
from
a
stone
thrown
in
the
water
.
Friend
Arthur
,
if
you
had
met
*NL*
that
kiss
which
you
know
of
before
poor
Lucy
die
;
or
again
,
last
night
*NL*
when
you
open
your
arms
to
her
,
you
would
in
time
,
when
you
had
died
,
*NL*
have
become
_
nosferatu
_
,
as
they
call
it
in
Eastern
Europe
,
and
would
*NL*
all
time
make
more
of
those
Un-Deads
that
so
have
fill
us
with
horror
.
*NL*
The
career
of
this
so
unhappy
dear
lady
is
but
just
begun
.
Those
*NL*
children
whose
blood
she
suck
are
not
as
yet
so
much
the
worse
;
but
if
*NL*
she
live
on
,
Un-Dead
,
more
and
more
they
lose
their
blood
and
by
her
*NL*
power
over
them
they
come
to
her
;
and
so
she
draw
their
blood
with
that
*NL*
so
wicked
mouth
.
But
if
she
die
in
truth
,
then
all
cease
;
the
tiny
*NL*
wounds
of
the
throats
disappear
,
and
they
go
back
to
their
plays
*NL*
unknowing
ever
of
what
has
been
.
But
of
the
most
blessed
of
all
,
when
*NL*
this
now
Un-Dead
be
made
to
rest
as
true
dead
,
then
the
soul
of
the
poor
*NL*
lady
whom
we
love
shall
again
be
free
.
Instead
of
working
wickedness
by
*NL*
night
and
growing
more
debased
in
the
assimilating
of
it
by
day
,
she
*NL*
shall
take
her
place
with
the
other
Angels
.
So
that
,
my
friend
,
it
will
*NL*
be
a
blessed
hand
for
her
that
shall
strike
the
blow
that
sets
her
free
.
*NL*
To
this
I
am
willing
;
but
is
there
none
amongst
us
who
has
a
better
*NL*
right
?
Will
it
be
no
joy
to
think
of
hereafter
in
the
silence
of
the
*NL*
night
when
sleep
is
not
:
`
It
was
my
hand
that
sent
her
to
the
stars
;
it
*NL*
was
the
hand
of
him
that
loved
her
best
;
the
hand
that
of
all
she
would
*NL*
herself
have
chosen
,
had
it
been
to
her
to
choose
?
'
Tell
me
if
there
be
*NL*
such
a
one
amongst
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
looked
at
Arthur
.
He
saw
,
too
,
what
we
all
did
,
the
infinite
*NL*
kindness
which
suggested
that
his
should
be
the
hand
which
would
restore
*NL*
Lucy
to
us
as
a
holy
,
and
not
an
unholy
,
memory
;
he
stepped
forward
and
*NL*
said
bravely
,
though
his
hand
trembled
,
and
his
face
was
as
pale
as
*NL*
snow
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
true
friend
,
from
the
bottom
of
my
broken
heart
I
thank
you
.
Tell
me
*NL*
what
I
am
to
do
,
and
I
shall
not
falter
!
''
Van
Helsing
laid
a
hand
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brave
lad
!
A
moment
's
courage
,
and
it
is
done
.
This
stake
must
be
*NL*
driven
through
her
.
It
will
be
a
fearful
ordeal
--
be
not
deceived
in
*NL*
that
--
but
it
will
be
only
a
short
time
,
and
you
will
then
rejoice
more
*NL*
than
your
pain
was
great
;
from
this
grim
tomb
you
will
emerge
as
though
*NL*
you
tread
on
air
.
But
you
must
not
falter
when
once
you
have
begun
.
Only
*NL*
think
that
we
,
your
true
friends
,
are
round
you
,
and
that
we
pray
for
*NL*
you
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
said
Arthur
hoarsely
.
``
Tell
me
what
I
am
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
this
stake
in
your
left
hand
,
ready
to
place
the
point
over
the
*NL*
heart
,
and
the
hammer
in
your
right
.
Then
when
we
begin
our
prayer
for
*NL*
the
dead
--
I
shall
read
him
,
I
have
here
the
book
,
and
the
others
shall
*NL*
follow
--
strike
in
God
's
name
,
that
so
all
may
be
well
with
the
dead
that
*NL*
we
love
and
that
the
Un-Dead
pass
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
took
the
stake
and
the
hammer
,
and
when
once
his
mind
was
set
on
*NL*
action
his
hands
never
trembled
nor
even
quivered
.
Van
Helsing
opened
*NL*
his
missal
and
began
to
read
,
and
Quincey
and
I
followed
as
well
as
we
*NL*
could
.
Arthur
placed
the
point
over
the
heart
,
and
as
I
looked
I
could
*NL*
see
its
dint
in
the
white
flesh
.
Then
he
struck
with
all
his
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thing
in
the
coffin
writhed
;
and
a
hideous
,
blood-curdling
screech
*NL*
came
from
the
opened
red
lips
.
The
body
shook
and
quivered
and
twisted
*NL*
in
wild
contortions
;
the
sharp
white
teeth
champed
together
till
the
*NL*
lips
were
cut
,
and
the
mouth
was
smeared
with
a
crimson
foam
.
But
Arthur
*NL*
never
faltered
.
He
looked
like
a
figure
of
Thor
as
his
untrembling
arm
*NL*
rose
and
fell
,
driving
deeper
and
deeper
the
mercy-bearing
stake
,
whilst
*NL*
the
blood
from
the
pierced
heart
welled
and
spurted
up
around
it
.
His
*NL*
face
was
set
,
and
high
duty
seemed
to
shine
through
it
;
the
sight
of
it
*NL*
gave
us
courage
so
that
our
voices
seemed
to
ring
through
the
little
*NL*
vault
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
writhing
and
quivering
of
the
body
became
less
,
and
the
*NL*
teeth
seemed
to
champ
,
and
the
face
to
quiver
.
Finally
it
lay
still
.
The
*NL*
terrible
task
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hammer
fell
from
Arthur
's
hand
.
He
reeled
and
would
have
fallen
had
*NL*
we
not
caught
him
.
The
great
drops
of
sweat
sprang
from
his
forehead
,
*NL*
and
his
breath
came
in
broken
gasps
.
It
had
indeed
been
an
awful
strain
*NL*
on
him
;
and
had
he
not
been
forced
to
his
task
by
more
than
human
*NL*
considerations
he
could
never
have
gone
through
with
it
.
For
a
few
*NL*
minutes
we
were
so
taken
up
with
him
that
we
did
not
look
towards
the
*NL*
coffin
.
When
we
did
,
however
,
a
murmur
of
startled
surprise
ran
from
one
*NL*
to
the
other
of
us
.
We
gazed
so
eagerly
that
Arthur
rose
,
for
he
had
*NL*
been
seated
on
the
ground
,
and
came
and
looked
too
;
and
then
a
glad
,
*NL*
strange
light
broke
over
his
face
and
dispelled
altogether
the
gloom
of
*NL*
horror
that
lay
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
in
the
coffin
lay
no
longer
the
foul
Thing
that
we
had
so
dreaded
*NL*
and
grown
to
hate
that
the
work
of
her
destruction
was
yielded
as
a
*NL*
privilege
to
the
one
best
entitled
to
it
,
but
Lucy
as
we
had
seen
her
in
*NL*
her
life
,
with
her
face
of
unequalled
sweetness
and
purity
.
True
that
*NL*
there
were
there
,
as
we
had
seen
them
in
life
,
the
traces
of
care
and
*NL*
pain
and
waste
;
but
these
were
all
dear
to
us
,
for
they
marked
her
truth
*NL*
to
what
we
knew
.
One
and
all
we
felt
that
the
holy
calm
that
lay
like
*NL*
sunshine
over
the
wasted
face
and
form
was
only
an
earthly
token
and
*NL*
symbol
of
the
calm
that
was
to
reign
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
came
and
laid
his
hand
on
Arthur
's
shoulder
,
and
said
to
*NL*
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Arthur
my
friend
,
dear
lad
,
am
I
not
forgiven
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reaction
of
the
terrible
strain
came
as
he
took
the
old
man
's
hand
*NL*
in
his
,
and
raising
it
to
his
lips
,
pressed
it
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgiven
!
God
bless
you
that
you
have
given
my
dear
one
her
soul
again
,
*NL*
and
me
peace
.
''
He
put
his
hands
on
the
Professor
's
shoulder
,
and
laying
*NL*
his
head
on
his
breast
,
cried
for
a
while
silently
,
whilst
we
stood
*NL*
unmoving
.
When
he
raised
his
head
Van
Helsing
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
my
child
,
you
may
kiss
her
.
Kiss
her
dead
lips
if
you
will
,
as
*NL*
she
would
have
you
to
,
if
for
her
to
choose
.
For
she
is
not
a
grinning
*NL*
devil
now
--
not
any
more
a
foul
Thing
for
all
eternity
.
No
longer
she
is
*NL*
the
devil
's
Un-Dead
.
She
is
God
's
true
dead
,
whose
soul
is
with
Him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
bent
and
kissed
her
,
and
then
we
sent
him
and
Quincey
out
of
the
*NL*
tomb
;
the
Professor
and
I
sawed
the
top
off
the
stake
,
leaving
the
point
*NL*
of
it
in
the
body
.
Then
we
cut
off
the
head
and
filled
the
mouth
with
*NL*
garlic
.
We
soldered
up
the
leaden
coffin
,
screwed
on
the
coffin-lid
,
*NL*
and
gathering
up
our
belongings
,
came
away
.
When
the
Professor
locked
*NL*
the
door
he
gave
the
key
to
Arthur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
air
was
sweet
,
the
sun
shone
,
and
the
birds
sang
,
and
it
*NL*
seemed
as
if
all
nature
were
tuned
to
a
different
pitch
.
There
was
*NL*
gladness
and
mirth
and
peace
everywhere
,
for
we
were
at
rest
ourselves
*NL*
on
one
account
,
and
we
were
glad
,
though
it
was
with
a
tempered
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
moved
away
Van
Helsing
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
friends
,
one
step
of
our
work
is
done
,
one
the
most
harrowing
*NL*
to
ourselves
.
But
there
remains
a
greater
task
:
to
find
out
the
author
*NL*
of
all
this
our
sorrow
and
to
stamp
him
out
.
I
have
clues
which
we
can
*NL*
follow
;
but
it
is
a
long
task
,
and
a
difficult
,
and
there
is
danger
in
*NL*
it
,
and
pain
.
Shall
you
not
all
help
me
?
We
have
learned
to
believe
,
all
*NL*
of
us
--
is
it
not
so
?
And
since
so
,
do
we
not
see
our
duty
?
Yes
!
And
do
*NL*
we
not
promise
to
go
on
to
the
bitter
end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Each
in
turn
,
we
took
his
hand
,
and
the
promise
was
made
.
Then
said
the
*NL*
Professor
as
we
moved
off
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
nights
hence
you
shall
meet
with
me
and
dine
together
at
seven
of
*NL*
the
clock
with
friend
John
.
I
shall
entreat
two
others
,
two
that
you
*NL*
know
not
as
yet
;
and
I
shall
be
ready
to
all
our
work
show
and
our
plans
*NL*
unfold
.
Friend
John
,
you
come
with
me
home
,
for
I
have
much
to
consult
*NL*
about
,
and
you
can
help
me
.
To-night
I
leave
for
Amsterdam
,
but
shall
*NL*
return
to-morrow
night
.
And
then
begins
our
great
quest
.
But
first
I
*NL*
shall
have
much
to
say
,
so
that
you
may
know
what
is
to
do
and
to
dread
.
*NL*
Then
our
promise
shall
be
made
to
each
other
anew
;
for
there
is
a
*NL*
terrible
task
before
us
,
and
once
our
feet
are
on
the
ploughshare
we
*NL*
must
not
draw
back

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
arrived
at
the
Berkeley
Hotel
,
Van
Helsing
found
a
telegram
*NL*
waiting
for
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
coming
up
by
train

Whitby

news

*NL*
HARKER
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Professor
was
delighted
.
``
Ah
,
that
wonderful
Madam
Mina
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
pearl
among
women
!
She
arrive
,
but
I
can
not
stay
.
She
must
go
to
your
*NL*
house
,
friend
John
.
You
must
meet
her
at
the
station
.
Telegraph
her
_
en
*NL*
route
_
,
so
that
she
may
be
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
wire
was
despatched
he
had
a
cup
of
tea
;
over
it
he
told
me
of
*NL*
a
diary
kept
by
Jonathan
Harker
when
abroad
,
and
gave
me
a
typewritten
*NL*
copy
of
it
,
as
also
of
Mrs.
Harker
's
diary
at
Whitby
.
``
Take
these
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
and
study
them
well
.
When
I
have
returned
you
will
be
master
of
*NL*
all
the
facts
,
and
we
can
then
better
enter
on
our
inquisition
.
Keep
*NL*
them
safe
,
for
there
is
in
them
much
of
treasure
.
You
will
need
all
your
*NL*
faith
,
even
you
who
have
had
such
an
experience
as
that
of
to-day
.
What
*NL*
is
here
told
,
''
he
laid
his
hand
heavily
and
gravely
on
the
packet
of
*NL*
papers
as
he
spoke
,
``
may
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
to
you
and
me
and
*NL*
many
another
;
or
it
may
sound
the
knell
of
the
Un-Dead
who
walk
the
*NL*
earth
.
Read
all
,
I
pray
you
,
with
the
open
mind
;
and
if
you
can
add
in
*NL*
any
way
to
the
story
here
told
do
so
,
for
it
is
all-important
.
You
have
*NL*
kept
diary
of
all
these
so
strange
things
;
is
it
not
so
?
Yes
!
Then
we
*NL*
shall
go
through
all
these
together
when
we
meet
.
''
He
then
made
ready
*NL*
for
his
departure
,
and
shortly
after
drove
off
to
Liverpool
Street
.
I
*NL*
took
my
way
to
Paddington
,
where
I
arrived
about
fifteen
minutes
before
*NL*
the
train
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
melted
away
,
after
the
bustling
fashion
common
to
arrival
*NL*
platforms
;
and
I
was
beginning
to
feel
uneasy
,
lest
I
might
miss
my
*NL*
guest
,
when
a
sweet-faced
,
dainty-looking
girl
stepped
up
to
me
,
and
,
*NL*
after
a
quick
glance
,
said
:
``
Dr.
Seward
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
Mrs.
Harker
!
''
I
answered
at
once
;
whereupon
she
held
out
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
from
the
description
of
poor
dear
Lucy
;
but
--
''
She
stopped
*NL*
suddenly
,
and
a
quick
blush
overspread
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blush
that
rose
to
my
own
cheeks
somehow
set
us
both
at
ease
,
for
it
*NL*
was
a
tacit
answer
to
her
own
.
I
got
her
luggage
,
which
included
a
*NL*
typewriter
,
and
we
took
the
Underground
to
Fenchurch
Street
,
after
I
had
*NL*
sent
a
wire
to
my
housekeeper
to
have
a
sitting-room
and
bedroom
*NL*
prepared
at
once
for
Mrs.
Harker
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
due
time
we
arrived
.
She
knew
,
of
course
,
that
the
place
was
a
*NL*
lunatic
asylum
,
but
I
could
see
that
she
was
unable
to
repress
a
shudder
*NL*
when
we
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
me
that
,
if
she
might
,
she
would
come
presently
to
my
study
,
as
*NL*
she
had
much
to
say
.
So
here
I
am
finishing
my
entry
in
my
phonograph
*NL*
diary
whilst
I
await
her
.
As
yet
I
have
not
had
the
chance
of
looking
at
*NL*
the
papers
which
Van
Helsing
left
with
me
,
though
they
lie
open
before
*NL*
me
.
I
must
get
her
interested
in
something
,
so
that
I
may
have
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
reading
them
.
She
does
not
know
how
precious
time
is
,
or
*NL*
what
a
task
we
have
in
hand
.
I
must
be
careful
not
to
frighten
her
.
Here
*NL*
she
is
!

29
September

--
After
I
had
tidied
myself
,
I
went
down
to
Dr.
Seward
's
*NL*
study
.
At
the
door
I
paused
a
moment
,
for
I
thought
I
heard
him
talking
*NL*
with
some
one
.
As
,
however
,
he
had
pressed
me
to
be
quick
,
I
knocked
at
*NL*
the
door
,
and
on
his
calling
out
,
``
Come
in
,
''
I
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
my
intense
surprise
,
there
was
no
one
with
him
.
He
was
quite
alone
,
*NL*
and
on
the
table
opposite
him
was
what
I
knew
at
once
from
the
*NL*
description
to
be
a
phonograph
.
I
had
never
seen
one
,
and
was
much
*NL*
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
did
not
keep
you
waiting
,
''
I
said
;
``
but
I
stayed
at
the
door
*NL*
as
I
heard
you
talking
,
and
thought
there
was
some
one
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
replied
with
a
smile
,
``
I
was
only
entering
my
diary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
diary
?
''
I
asked
him
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
keep
it
in
this
.
''
As
he
spoke
he
laid
his
hand
on
*NL*
the
phonograph
.
I
felt
quite
excited
over
it
,
and
blurted
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
beats
even
shorthand
!
May
I
hear
it
say
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
he
replied
with
alacrity
,
and
stood
up
to
put
it
in
train
*NL*
for
speaking
.
Then
he
paused
,
and
a
troubled
look
overspread
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
''
he
began
awkwardly
,
``
I
only
keep
my
diary
in
it
;
and
as
*NL*
it
is
entirely
--
almost
entirely
--
about
my
cases
,
it
may
be
awkward
--
that
*NL*
is
,
I
mean
--
''
He
stopped
,
and
I
tried
to
help
him
out
of
his
*NL*
embarrassment
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
helped
to
attend
dear
Lucy
at
the
end
.
Let
me
hear
how
she
died
;
*NL*
for
all
that
I
know
of
her
,
I
shall
be
very
grateful
.
She
was
very
,
very
*NL*
dear
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
my
surprise
,
he
answered
,
with
a
horrorstruck
look
in
his
face
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
you
of
her
death
?
Not
for
the
wide
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
I
asked
,
for
some
grave
,
terrible
feeling
was
coming
over
me
.
*NL*
Again
he
paused
,
and
I
could
see
that
he
was
trying
to
invent
an
excuse
.
*NL*
At
length
he
stammered
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
do
not
know
how
to
pick
out
any
particular
part
of
the
*NL*
diary
.
''
Even
while
he
was
speaking
an
idea
dawned
upon
him
,
and
he
said
*NL*
with
unconscious
simplicity
,
in
a
different
voice
,
and
with
the
naivete
*NL*
of
a
child
:
``
That
's
quite
true
,
upon
my
honour
.
Honest
Indian
!
''
I
could
*NL*
not
but
smile
,
at
which
he
grimaced
.
``
I
gave
myself
away
that
time
!
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
But
do
you
know
that
,
although
I
have
kept
the
diary
for
months
*NL*
past
,
it
never
once
struck
me
how
I
was
going
to
find
any
particular
*NL*
part
of
it
in
case
I
wanted
to
look
it
up
?
''
By
this
time
my
mind
was
*NL*
made
up
that
the
diary
of
a
doctor
who
attended
Lucy
might
have
*NL*
something
to
add
to
the
sum
of
our
knowledge
of
that
terrible
Being
,
and
*NL*
I
said
boldly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Dr.
Seward
,
you
had
better
let
me
copy
it
out
for
you
on
my
*NL*
typewriter
.
''
He
grew
to
a
positively
deathly
pallor
as
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
no
!
no
!
For
all
the
world
,
I
would
n't
let
you
know
that
terrible
*NL*
story
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
terrible
;
my
intuition
was
right
!
For
a
moment
I
thought
,
*NL*
and
as
my
eyes
ranged
the
room
,
unconsciously
looking
for
something
or
*NL*
some
opportunity
to
aid
me
,
they
lit
on
a
great
batch
of
typewriting
on
*NL*
the
table
.
His
eyes
caught
the
look
in
mine
,
and
,
without
his
thinking
,
*NL*
followed
their
direction
.
As
they
saw
the
parcel
he
realised
my
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
know
me
,
''
I
said
.
``
When
you
have
read
those
papers
--
my
own
*NL*
diary
and
my
husband
's
also
,
which
I
have
typed
--
you
will
know
me
*NL*
better
.
I
have
not
faltered
in
giving
every
thought
of
my
own
heart
in
*NL*
this
cause
;
but
,
of
course
,
you
do
not
know
me
--
yet
;
and
I
must
not
*NL*
expect
you
to
trust
me
so
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
certainly
a
man
of
noble
nature
;
poor
dear
Lucy
was
right
about
*NL*
him
.
He
stood
up
and
opened
a
large
drawer
,
in
which
were
arranged
in
*NL*
order
a
number
of
hollow
cylinders
of
metal
covered
with
dark
wax
,
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
right
.
I
did
not
trust
you
because
I
did
not
know
you
.
*NL*
But
I
know
you
now
;
and
let
me
say
that
I
should
have
known
you
long
*NL*
ago
.
I
know
that
Lucy
told
you
of
me
;
she
told
me
of
you
too
.
May
I
make
*NL*
the
only
atonement
in
my
power
?
Take
the
cylinders
and
hear
them
--
the
*NL*
first
half-dozen
of
them
are
personal
to
me
,
and
they
will
not
horrify
*NL*
you
;
then
you
will
know
me
better
.
Dinner
will
by
then
be
ready
.
In
the
*NL*
meantime
I
shall
read
over
some
of
these
documents
,
and
shall
be
better
*NL*
able
to
understand
certain
things
.
''
He
carried
the
phonograph
himself
up
*NL*
to
my
sitting-room
and
adjusted
it
for
me
.
Now
I
shall
learn
something
*NL*
pleasant
,
I
am
sure
;
for
it
will
tell
me
the
other
side
of
a
true
love
*NL*
episode
of
which
I
know
one
side
already

--
I
was
so
absorbed
in
that
wonderful
diary
of
Jonathan
*NL*
Harker
and
that
other
of
his
wife
that
I
let
the
time
run
on
without
*NL*
thinking
.
Mrs.
Harker
was
not
down
when
the
maid
came
to
announce
*NL*
dinner
,
so
I
said
:
``
She
is
possibly
tired
;
let
dinner
wait
an
hour
,

and
*NL*
I
went
on
with
my
work
.
I
had
just
finished
Mrs.
Harker
's
diary
,
when
*NL*
she
came
in
.
She
looked
sweetly
pretty
,
but
very
sad
,
and
her
eyes
were
*NL*
flushed
with
crying
.
This
somehow
moved
me
much
.
Of
late
I
have
had
*NL*
cause
for
tears
,
God
knows
!
but
the
relief
of
them
was
denied
me
;
and
*NL*
now
the
sight
of
those
sweet
eyes
,
brightened
with
recent
tears
,
went
*NL*
straight
to
my
heart
.
So
I
said
as
gently
as
I
could
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
greatly
fear
I
have
distressed
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
not
distressed
me
,
''
she
replied
,
``
but
I
have
been
more
touched
*NL*
than
I
can
say
by
your
grief
.
That
is
a
wonderful
machine
,
but
it
is
*NL*
cruelly
true
.
It
told
me
,
in
its
very
tones
,
the
anguish
of
your
heart
.
*NL*
It
was
like
a
soul
crying
out
to
Almighty
God
.
No
one
must
hear
them
*NL*
spoken
ever
again
!
See
,
I
have
tried
to
be
useful
.
I
have
copied
out
the
*NL*
words
on
my
typewriter
,
and
none
other
need
now
hear
your
heart
beat
,
as
*NL*
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
need
ever
know
,
shall
ever
know
,
''
I
said
in
a
low
voice
.
She
*NL*
laid
her
hand
on
mine
and
said
very
gravely
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
they
must
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
!
But
why
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
is
a
part
of
the
terrible
story
,
a
part
of
poor
dear
Lucy
's
*NL*
death
and
all
that
led
to
it
;
because
in
the
struggle
which
we
have
*NL*
before
us
to
rid
the
earth
of
this
terrible
monster
we
must
have
all
*NL*
the
knowledge
and
all
the
help
which
we
can
get
.
I
think
that
the
*NL*
cylinders
which
you
gave
me
contained
more
than
you
intended
me
to
know
;
*NL*
but
I
can
see
that
there
are
in
your
record
many
lights
to
this
dark
*NL*
mystery
.
You
will
let
me
help
,
will
you
not
?
I
know
all
up
to
a
certain
*NL*
point
;
and
I
see
already
,
though
your
diary
only
took
me
to
7
September
,
*NL*
how
poor
Lucy
was
beset
,
and
how
her
terrible
doom
was
being
wrought
*NL*
out
.
Jonathan
and
I
have
been
working
day
and
night
since
Professor
Van
*NL*
Helsing
saw
us
.
He
is
gone
to
Whitby
to
get
more
information
,
and
he
*NL*
will
be
here
to-morrow
to
help
us
.
We
need
have
no
secrets
amongst
us
;
*NL*
working
together
and
with
absolute
trust
,
we
can
surely
be
stronger
than
*NL*
if
some
of
us
were
in
the
dark
.
''
She
looked
at
me
so
appealingly
,
and
at
*NL*
the
same
time
manifested
such
courage
and
resolution
in
her
bearing
,
*NL*
that
I
gave
in
at
once
to
her
wishes
.
``
You
shall
,
''
I
said
,
``
do
as
you
*NL*
like
in
the
matter
.
God
forgive
me
if
I
do
wrong
!
There
are
terrible
*NL*
things
yet
to
learn
of
;
but
if
you
have
so
far
travelled
on
the
road
to
*NL*
poor
Lucy
's
death
,
you
will
not
be
content
,
I
know
,
to
remain
in
the
*NL*
dark
.
Nay
,
the
end
--
the
very
end
--
may
give
you
a
gleam
of
peace
.
Come
,
*NL*
there
is
dinner
.
We
must
keep
one
another
strong
for
what
is
before
us
;
*NL*
we
have
a
cruel
and
dreadful
task
.
When
you
have
eaten
you
shall
learn
*NL*
the
rest
,
and
I
shall
answer
any
questions
you
ask
--
if
there
be
anything
*NL*
which
you
do
not
understand
,
though
it
was
apparent
to
us
who
were
*NL*
present

After
dinner
I
came
with
Dr.
Seward
to
his
study
.
He
*NL*
brought
back
the
phonograph
from
my
room
,
and
I
took
my
typewriter
.
He
*NL*
placed
me
in
a
comfortable
chair
,
and
arranged
the
phonograph
so
that
I
*NL*
could
touch
it
without
getting
up
,
and
showed
me
how
to
stop
it
in
case
*NL*
I
should
want
to
pause
.
Then
he
very
thoughtfully
took
a
chair
,
with
his
*NL*
back
to
me
,
so
that
I
might
be
as
free
as
possible
,
and
began
to
read
.
I
*NL*
put
the
forked
metal
to
my
ears
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
terrible
story
of
Lucy
's
death
,
and
--
and
all
that
followed
,
was
*NL*
done
,
I
lay
back
in
my
chair
powerless
.
Fortunately
I
am
not
of
a
*NL*
fainting
disposition
.
When
Dr.
Seward
saw
me
he
jumped
up
with
a
*NL*
horrified
exclamation
,
and
hurriedly
taking
a
case-bottle
from
a
*NL*
cupboard
,
gave
me
some
brandy
,
which
in
a
few
minutes
somewhat
restored
*NL*
me
.
My
brain
was
all
in
a
whirl
,
and
only
that
there
came
through
all
*NL*
the
multitude
of
horrors
,
the
holy
ray
of
light
that
my
dear
,
dear
Lucy
*NL*
was
at
last
at
peace
,
I
do
not
think
I
could
have
borne
it
without
*NL*
making
a
scene
.
It
is
all
so
wild
,
and
mysterious
,
and
strange
that
if
I
*NL*
had
not
known
Jonathan
's
experience
in
Transylvania
I
could
not
have
*NL*
believed
.
As
it
was
,
I
did
n't
know
what
to
believe
,
and
so
got
out
of
my
*NL*
difficulty
by
attending
to
something
else
.
I
took
the
cover
off
my
*NL*
typewriter
,
and
said
to
Dr.
Seward
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
write
this
all
out
now
.
We
must
be
ready
for
Dr.
Van
Helsing
*NL*
when
he
comes
.
I
have
sent
a
telegram
to
Jonathan
to
come
on
here
when
*NL*
he
arrives
in
London
from
Whitby
.
In
this
matter
dates
are
everything
,
*NL*
and
I
think
that
if
we
get
all
our
material
ready
,
and
have
every
item
*NL*
put
in
chronological
order
,
we
shall
have
done
much
.
You
tell
me
that
*NL*
Lord
Godalming
and
Mr.
Morris
are
coming
too
.
Let
us
be
able
to
tell
him
*NL*
when
they
come
.
''
He
accordingly
set
the
phonograph
at
a
slow
pace
,
and
I
*NL*
began
to
typewrite
from
the
beginning
of
the
seventh
cylinder
.
I
used
*NL*
manifold
,
and
so
took
three
copies
of
the
diary
,
just
as
I
had
done
with
*NL*
all
the
rest
.
It
was
late
when
I
got
through
,
but
Dr.
Seward
went
about
*NL*
his
work
of
going
his
round
of
the
patients
;
when
he
had
finished
he
*NL*
came
back
and
sat
near
me
,
reading
,
so
that
I
did
not
feel
too
lonely
*NL*
whilst
I
worked
.
How
good
and
thoughtful
he
is
;
the
world
seems
full
of
*NL*
good
men
--
even
if
there
_
are
_
monsters
in
it
.
Before
I
left
him
I
*NL*
remembered
what
Jonathan
put
in
his
diary
of
the
Professor
's
*NL*
perturbation
at
reading
something
in
an
evening
paper
at
the
station
at
*NL*
Exeter
;
so
,
seeing
that
Dr.
Seward
keeps
his
newspapers
,
I
borrowed
the
*NL*
files
of
``
The
Westminster
Gazette
''
and
``
The
Pall
Mall
Gazette
,
''
and
took
*NL*
them
to
my
room
.
I
remember
how
much
``
The
Dailygraph
''
and
``
The
Whitby
*NL*
Gazette
,
''
of
which
I
had
made
cuttings
,
helped
us
to
understand
the
*NL*
terrible
events
at
Whitby
when
Count
Dracula
landed
,
so
I
shall
look
*NL*
through
the
evening
papers
since
then
,
and
perhaps
I
shall
get
some
new
*NL*
light
.
I
am
not
sleepy
,
and
the
work
will
help
to
keep
me
quiet
.

--
Mr.
Harker
arrived
at
nine
o'clock
.
He
had
got
his
*NL*
wife
's
wire
just
before
starting
.
He
is
uncommonly
clever
,
if
one
can
*NL*
judge
from
his
face
,
and
full
of
energy
.
If
this
journal
be
true
--
and
*NL*
judging
by
one
's
own
wonderful
experiences
,
it
must
be
--
he
is
also
a
man
*NL*
of
great
nerve
.
That
going
down
to
the
vault
a
second
time
was
a
*NL*
remarkable
piece
of
daring
.
After
reading
his
account
of
it
I
was
*NL*
prepared
to
meet
a
good
specimen
of
manhood
,
but
hardly
the
quiet
,
*NL*
business-like
gentleman
who
came
here
to-day
.

After
lunch
Harker
and
his
wife
went
back
to
their
own
room
,
*NL*
and
as
I
passed
a
while
ago
I
heard
the
click
of
the
typewriter
.
They
*NL*
are
hard
at
it
.
Mrs.
Harker
says
that
they
are
knitting
together
in
*NL*
chronological
order
every
scrap
of
evidence
they
have
.
Harker
has
got
*NL*
the
letters
between
the
consignee
of
the
boxes
at
Whitby
and
the
*NL*
carriers
in
London
who
took
charge
of
them
.
He
is
now
reading
his
wife
's
*NL*
typescript
of
my
diary
.
I
wonder
what
they
make
out
of
it
.
Here
it
*NL*
is
...
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
that
it
never
struck
me
that
the
very
next
house
might
be
*NL*
the
Count
's
hiding-place
!
Goodness
knows
that
we
had
enough
clues
*NL*
from
the
conduct
of
the
patient
Renfield
!
The
bundle
of
letters
*NL*
relating
to
the
purchase
of
the
house
were
with
the
typescript
.
Oh
,
*NL*
if
we
had
only
had
them
earlier
we
might
have
saved
poor
Lucy
!
*NL*
Stop
;
that
way
madness
lies
!
Harker
has
gone
back
,
and
is
again
*NL*
collating
his
material
.
He
says
that
by
dinner-time
they
will
be
*NL*
able
to
show
a
whole
connected
narrative
.
He
thinks
that
in
the
*NL*
meantime
I
should
see
Renfield
,
as
hitherto
he
has
been
a
sort
of
*NL*
index
to
the
coming
and
going
of
the
Count
.
I
hardly
see
this
yet
,
*NL*
but
when
I
get
at
the
dates
I
suppose
I
shall
.
What
a
good
thing
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Harker
put
my
cylinders
into
type
!
We
never
could
have
*NL*
found
the
dates
otherwise
...
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
Renfield
sitting
placidly
in
his
room
with
his
hands
*NL*
folded
,
smiling
benignly
.
At
the
moment
he
seemed
as
sane
as
any
*NL*
one
I
ever
saw
.
I
sat
down
and
talked
with
him
on
a
lot
of
*NL*
subjects
,
all
of
which
he
treated
naturally
.
He
then
,
of
his
own
*NL*
accord
,
spoke
of
going
home
,
a
subject
he
has
never
mentioned
to
my
*NL*
knowledge
during
his
sojourn
here
.
In
fact
,
he
spoke
quite
*NL*
confidently
of
getting
his
discharge
at
once
.
I
believe
that
,
had
I
*NL*
not
had
the
chat
with
Harker
and
read
the
letters
and
the
dates
of
*NL*
his
outbursts
,
I
should
have
been
prepared
to
sign
for
him
after
a
*NL*
brief
time
of
observation
.
As
it
is
,
I
am
darkly
suspicious
.
All
*NL*
those
outbreaks
were
in
some
way
linked
with
the
proximity
of
the
*NL*
Count
.
What
then
does
this
absolute
content
mean
?
Can
it
be
that
*NL*
his
instinct
is
satisfied
as
to
the
vampire
's
ultimate
triumph
?
*NL*
Stay
;
he
is
himself
zooephagous
,
and
in
his
wild
ravings
outside
the
*NL*
chapel
door
of
the
deserted
house
he
always
spoke
of
``
master
.
''
This
*NL*
all
seems
confirmation
of
our
idea
.
However
,
after
a
while
I
came
*NL*
away
;
my
friend
is
just
a
little
too
sane
at
present
to
make
it
*NL*
safe
to
probe
him
too
deep
with
questions
.
He
might
begin
to
think
,
*NL*
and
then
--
!
So
I
came
away
.
I
mistrust
these
quiet
moods
of
his
;
so
*NL*
I
have
given
the
attendant
a
hint
to
look
closely
after
him
,
and
to
*NL*
have
a
strait-waistcoat
ready
in
case
of
need
.

29
September
,
in
train
to
London
.
_
--
When
I
received
Mr.
Billington
's
*NL*
courteous
message
that
he
would
give
me
any
information
in
his
power
I
*NL*
thought
it
best
to
go
down
to
Whitby
and
make
,
on
the
spot
,
such
*NL*
inquiries
as
I
wanted
.
It
was
now
my
object
to
trace
that
horrid
cargo
*NL*
of
the
Count
's
to
its
place
in
London
.
Later
,
we
may
be
able
to
deal
*NL*
with
it
.
Billington
junior
,
a
nice
lad
,
met
me
at
the
station
,
and
*NL*
brought
me
to
his
father
's
house
,
where
they
had
decided
that
I
must
*NL*
stay
the
night
.
They
are
hospitable
,
with
true
Yorkshire
hospitality
:
*NL*
give
a
guest
everything
,
and
leave
him
free
to
do
as
he
likes
.
They
all
*NL*
knew
that
I
was
busy
,
and
that
my
stay
was
short
,
and
Mr.
Billington
had
*NL*
ready
in
his
office
all
the
papers
concerning
the
consignment
of
boxes
.
*NL*
It
gave
me
almost
a
turn
to
see
again
one
of
the
letters
which
I
had
*NL*
seen
on
the
Count
's
table
before
I
knew
of
his
diabolical
plans
.
*NL*
Everything
had
been
carefully
thought
out
,
and
done
systematically
and
*NL*
with
precision
.
He
seemed
to
have
been
prepared
for
every
obstacle
which
*NL*
might
be
placed
by
accident
in
the
way
of
his
intentions
being
carried
*NL*
out
.
To
use
an
Americanism
,
he
had
``
taken
no
chances
,
''
and
the
absolute
*NL*
accuracy
with
which
his
instructions
were
fulfilled
,
was
simply
the
*NL*
logical
result
of
his
care
.
I
saw
the
invoice
,
and
took
note
of
it
:
*NL*
``
Fifty
cases
of
common
earth
,
to
be
used
for
experimental
purposes
.
''
*NL*
Also
the
copy
of
letter
to
Carter
Paterson
,
and
their
reply
;
of
both
of
*NL*
these
I
got
copies
.
This
was
all
the
information
Mr.
Billington
could
*NL*
give
me
,
so
I
went
down
to
the
port
and
saw
the
coastguards
,
the
Customs
*NL*
officers
and
the
harbour-master
.
They
had
all
something
to
say
of
the
*NL*
strange
entry
of
the
ship
,
which
is
already
taking
its
place
in
local
*NL*
tradition
;
but
no
one
could
add
to
the
simple
description
``
Fifty
cases
*NL*
of
common
earth
.
''
I
then
saw
the
station-master
,
who
kindly
put
me
in
*NL*
communication
with
the
men
who
had
actually
received
the
boxes
.
Their
*NL*
tally
was
exact
with
the
list
,
and
they
had
nothing
to
add
except
that
*NL*
the
boxes
were
``
main
and
mortal
heavy
,
''
and
that
shifting
them
was
dry
*NL*
work
.
One
of
them
added
that
it
was
hard
lines
that
there
was
n't
any
*NL*
gentleman
``
such-like
as
yourself
,
squire
,
''
to
show
some
sort
of
*NL*
appreciation
of
their
efforts
in
a
liquid
form
;
another
put
in
a
rider
*NL*
that
the
thirst
then
generated
was
such
that
even
the
time
which
had
*NL*
elapsed
had
not
completely
allayed
it
.
Needless
to
add
,
I
took
care
*NL*
before
leaving
to
lift
,
for
ever
and
adequately
,
this
source
of
*NL*
reproach
.

The
station-master
was
good
enough
to
give
me
a
line
to
*NL*
his
old
companion
the
station-master
at
King
's
Cross
,
so
that
when
I
*NL*
arrived
there
in
the
morning
I
was
able
to
ask
him
about
the
arrival
of
*NL*
the
boxes
.
He
,
too
,
put
me
at
once
in
communication
with
the
proper
*NL*
officials
,
and
I
saw
that
their
tally
was
correct
with
the
original
*NL*
invoice
.
The
opportunities
of
acquiring
an
abnormal
thirst
had
been
here
*NL*
limited
;
a
noble
use
of
them
had
,
however
,
been
made
,
and
again
I
was
*NL*
compelled
to
deal
with
the
result
in
an
_
ex
post
facto
_
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
thence
I
went
on
to
Carter
Paterson
's
central
office
,
where
I
met
*NL*
with
the
utmost
courtesy
.
They
looked
up
the
transaction
in
their
*NL*
day-book
and
letter-book
,
and
at
once
telephoned
to
their
King
's
Cross
*NL*
office
for
more
details
.
By
good
fortune
,
the
men
who
did
the
teaming
*NL*
were
waiting
for
work
,
and
the
official
at
once
sent
them
over
,
sending
*NL*
also
by
one
of
them
the
way-bill
and
all
the
papers
connected
with
the
*NL*
delivery
of
the
boxes
at
Carfax
.
Here
again
I
found
the
tally
agreeing
*NL*
exactly
;
the
carriers
'
men
were
able
to
supplement
the
paucity
of
the
*NL*
written
words
with
a
few
details
.
These
were
,
I
shortly
found
,
connected
*NL*
almost
solely
with
the
dusty
nature
of
the
job
,
and
of
the
consequent
*NL*
thirst
engendered
in
the
operators
.
On
my
affording
an
opportunity
,
*NL*
through
the
medium
of
the
currency
of
the
realm
,
of
the
allaying
,
at
a
*NL*
later
period
,
this
beneficial
evil
,
one
of
the
men
remarked
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
`
ere
`

,

`
nor

the
rummiest
I
ever
was
in

Blyme
!
but
it
*NL*
ai
n't
been
touched
sence
a
hundred
years
.
There
was
dust
that
thick
in
*NL*
the
place
that
you
might
have
slep
'
on
it
without
`
urtin
'
of

bones
;
*NL*
an
'

place

that
neglected
that

might

in
it

But

that

that

my

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Having
been
in
the
house
,
I
could
well
believe
him
;
but
if
he
knew
what
*NL*
I
know
,
he
would
,
I
think
,
have
raised
his
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
one
thing
I
am
now
satisfied
:
that
_
all
_
the
boxes
which
arrived
at
*NL*
Whitby
from
Varna
in
the
_
Demeter
_
were
safely
deposited
in
the
old
*NL*
chapel
at
Carfax
.
There
should
be
fifty
of
them
there
,
unless
any
have
*NL*
since
been
removed
--
as
from
Dr.
Seward
's
diary
I
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
try
to
see
the
carter
who
took
away
the
boxes
from
Carfax
when
*NL*
Renfield
attacked
them
.
By
following
up
this
clue
we
may
learn
a
good
*NL*
deal

I
am
so
glad
that
I
hardly
know
how
to
contain
myself
.
*NL*
It
is
,
I
suppose
,
the
reaction
from
the
haunting
fear
which
I
have
had
:
*NL*
that
this
terrible
affair
and
the
reopening
of
his
old
wound
might
act
*NL*
detrimentally
on
Jonathan
.
I
saw
him
leave
for
Whitby
with
as
brave
a
*NL*
face
as
I
could
,
but
I
was
sick
with
apprehension
.
The
effort
has
,
*NL*
however
,
done
him
good
.
He
was
never
so
resolute
,
never
so
strong
,
never
*NL*
so
full
of
volcanic
energy
,
as
at
present
.
It
is
just
as
that
dear
,
good
*NL*
Professor
Van
Helsing
said
:
he
is
true
grit
,
and
he
improves
under
*NL*
strain
that
would
kill
a
weaker
nature
.
He
came
back
full
of
life
and
*NL*
hope
and
determination
;
we
have
got
everything
in
order
for
to-night
.
I
*NL*
feel
myself
quite
wild
with
excitement
.
I
suppose
one
ought
to
pity
any
*NL*
thing
so
hunted
as
is
the
Count
.
That
is
just
it
:
this
Thing
is
not
*NL*
human
--
not
even
beast
.
To
read
Dr.
Seward
's
account
of
poor
Lucy
's
*NL*
death
,
and
what
followed
,
is
enough
to
dry
up
the
springs
of
pity
in
*NL*
one
's
heart
.

_
Later
.
_
--
Lord
Godalming
and
Mr.
Morris
arrived
earlier
than
we
*NL*
expected
.
Dr.
Seward
was
out
on
business
,
and
had
taken
Jonathan
with
*NL*
him
,
so
I
had
to
see
them
.
It
was
to
me
a
painful
meeting
,
for
it
*NL*
brought
back
all
poor
dear
Lucy
's
hopes
of
only
a
few
months
ago
.
Of
*NL*
course
they
had
heard
Lucy
speak
of
me
,
and
it
seemed
that
Dr.
Van
*NL*
Helsing
,
too
,
has
been
quite
``
blowing
my
trumpet
,
''
as
Mr.
Morris
*NL*
expressed
it
.
Poor
fellows
,
neither
of
them
is
aware
that
I
know
all
*NL*
about
the
proposals
they
made
to
Lucy
.
They
did
not
quite
know
what
to
*NL*
say
or
do
,
as
they
were
ignorant
of
the
amount
of
my
knowledge
;
so
they
*NL*
had
to
keep
on
neutral
subjects
.
However
,
I
thought
the
matter
over
,
and
*NL*
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
best
thing
I
could
do
would
be
to
post
*NL*
them
in
affairs
right
up
to
date
.
I
knew
from
Dr.
Seward
's
diary
that
*NL*
they
had
been
at
Lucy
's
death
--
her
real
death
--
and
that
I
need
not
fear
*NL*
to
betray
any
secret
before
the
time
.
So
I
told
them
,
as
well
as
I
*NL*
could
,
that
I
had
read
all
the
papers
and
diaries
,
and
that
my
husband
*NL*
and
I
,
having
typewritten
them
,
had
just
finished
putting
them
in
order
.
*NL*
I
gave
them
each
a
copy
to
read
in
the
library
.
When
Lord
Godalming
got
*NL*
his
and
turned
it
over
--
it
does
make
a
pretty
good
pile
--
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
write
all
this
,
Mrs.
Harker
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
nodded
,
and
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
see
the
drift
of
it
;
but
you
people
are
all
so
good
and
*NL*
kind
,
and
have
been
working
so
earnestly
and
so
energetically
,
that
all
*NL*
I
can
do
is
to
accept
your
ideas
blindfold
and
try
to
help
you
.
I
have
*NL*
had
one
lesson
already
in
accepting
facts
that
should
make
a
man
humble
*NL*
to
the
last
hour
of
his
life
.
Besides
,
I
know
you
loved
my
poor
Lucy
--
''
*NL*
Here
he
turned
away
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
.
I
could
hear
*NL*
the
tears
in
his
voice
.
Mr.
Morris
,
with
instinctive
delicacy
,
just
laid
*NL*
a
hand
for
a
moment
on
his
shoulder
,
and
then
walked
quietly
out
of
the
*NL*
room
.
I
suppose
there
is
something
in
woman
's
nature
that
makes
a
man
*NL*
free
to
break
down
before
her
and
express
his
feelings
on
the
tender
or
*NL*
emotional
side
without
feeling
it
derogatory
to
his
manhood
;
for
when
*NL*
Lord
Godalming
found
himself
alone
with
me
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
*NL*
gave
way
utterly
and
openly
.
I
sat
down
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
.
I
*NL*
hope
he
did
n't
think
it
forward
of
me
,
and
that
if
he
ever
thinks
of
it
*NL*
afterwards
he
never
will
have
such
a
thought
.
There
I
wrong
him
;
I
*NL*
_
know
_
he
never
will
--
he
is
too
true
a
gentleman
.
I
said
to
him
,
for
I
*NL*
could
see
that
his
heart
was
breaking
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
loved
dear
Lucy
,
and
I
know
what
she
was
to
you
,
and
what
you
were
to
*NL*
her
.
She
and
I
were
like
sisters
;
and
now
she
is
gone
,
will
you
not
let
*NL*
me
be
like
a
sister
to
you
in
your
trouble
?
I
know
what
sorrows
you
have
*NL*
had
,
though
I
can
not
measure
the
depth
of
them
.
If
sympathy
and
pity
can
*NL*
help
in
your
affliction
,
wo
n't
you
let
me
be
of
some
little
service
--
for
*NL*
Lucy
's
sake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
the
poor
dear
fellow
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
me
that
all
that
he
had
of
late
been
suffering
in
silence
found
a
*NL*
vent
at
once
.
He
grew
quite
hysterical
,
and
raising
his
open
hands
,
beat
*NL*
his
palms
together
in
a
perfect
agony
of
grief
.
He
stood
up
and
then
sat
*NL*
down
again
,
and
the
tears
rained
down
his
cheeks
.
I
felt
an
infinite
*NL*
pity
for
him
,
and
opened
my
arms
unthinkingly
.
With
a
sob
he
laid
his
*NL*
head
on
my
shoulder
and
cried
like
a
wearied
child
,
whilst
he
shook
with
*NL*
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
women
have
something
of
the
mother
in
us
that
makes
us
rise
above
*NL*
smaller
matters
when
the
mother-spirit
is
invoked
;
I
felt
this
big
*NL*
sorrowing
man
's
head
resting
on
me
,
as
though
it
were
that
of
the
baby
*NL*
that
some
day
may
lie
on
my
bosom
,
and
I
stroked
his
hair
as
though
he
*NL*
were
my
own
child
.
I
never
thought
at
the
time
how
strange
it
all
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
bit
his
sobs
ceased
,
and
he
raised
himself
with
an
*NL*
apology
,
though
he
made
no
disguise
of
his
emotion
.
He
told
me
that
for
*NL*
days
and
nights
past
--
weary
days
and
sleepless
nights
--
he
had
been
*NL*
unable
to
speak
with
any
one
,
as
a
man
must
speak
in
his
time
of
*NL*
sorrow
.
There
was
no
woman
whose
sympathy
could
be
given
to
him
,
or
with
*NL*
whom
,
owing
to
the
terrible
circumstance
with
which
his
sorrow
was
*NL*
surrounded
,
he
could
speak
freely
.
``
I
know
now
how
I
suffered
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
as
he
dried
his
eyes
,
``
but
I
do
not
know
even
yet
--
and
none
other
can
*NL*
ever
know
--
how
much
your
sweet
sympathy
has
been
to
me
to-day
.
I
shall
*NL*
know
better
in
time
;
and
believe
me
that
,
though
I
am
not
ungrateful
*NL*
now
,
my
gratitude
will
grow
with
my
understanding
.
You
will
let
me
be
*NL*
like
a
brother
,
will
you
not
,
for
all
our
lives
--
for
dear
Lucy
's
sake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
dear
Lucy
's
sake
,
''
I
said
as
we
clasped
hands
.
``
Ay
,
and
for
your
*NL*
own
sake
,
''
he
added
,
``
for
if
a
man
's
esteem
and
gratitude
are
ever
worth
*NL*
the
winning
,
you
have
won
mine
to-day
.
If
ever
the
future
should
bring
*NL*
to
you
a
time
when
you
need
a
man
's
help
,
believe
me
,
you
will
not
call
*NL*
in
vain
.
God
grant
that
no
such
time
may
ever
come
to
you
to
break
the
*NL*
sunshine
of
your
life
;
but
if
it
should
ever
come
,
promise
me
that
you
*NL*
will
let
me
know
.
''
He
was
so
earnest
,
and
his
sorrow
was
so
fresh
,
that
*NL*
I
felt
it
would
comfort
him
,
so
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
came
along
the
corridor
I
saw
Mr.
Morris
looking
out
of
a
window
.
*NL*
He
turned
as
he
heard
my
footsteps
.
``
How
is
Art
?
''
he
said
.
Then
noticing
*NL*
my
red
eyes
,
he
went
on
:
``
Ah
,
I
see
you
have
been
comforting
him
.
Poor
*NL*
old
fellow
!
he
needs
it
.
No
one
but
a
woman
can
help
a
man
when
he
is
in
*NL*
trouble
of
the
heart
;
and
he
had
no
one
to
comfort
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bore
his
own
trouble
so
bravely
that
my
heart
bled
for
him
.
I
saw
the
*NL*
manuscript
in
his
hand
,
and
I
knew
that
when
he
read
it
he
would
realise
*NL*
how
much
I
knew
;
so
I
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
comfort
all
who
suffer
from
the
heart
.
Will
you
let
me
*NL*
be
your
friend
,
and
will
you
come
to
me
for
comfort
if
you
need
it
?
You
*NL*
will
know
,
later
on
,
why
I
speak
.
''
He
saw
that
I
was
in
earnest
,
and
*NL*
stooping
,
took
my
hand
,
and
raising
it
to
his
lips
,
kissed
it
.
It
seemed
*NL*
but
poor
comfort
to
so
brave
and
unselfish
a
soul
,
and
impulsively
I
*NL*
bent
over
and
kissed
him
.
The
tears
rose
in
his
eyes
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
momentary
choking
in
his
throat
;
he
said
quite
calmly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
girl
,
you
will
never
regret
that
true-hearted
kindness
,
so
long
*NL*
as
ever
you
live
!
''
Then
he
went
into
the
study
to
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
girl
!
''
--
the
very
words
he
had
used
to
Lucy
,
and
oh
,
but
he
*NL*
proved
himself
a
friend
!

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
DR.
SEWARD
'S
DIARY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
30
September
.
_
--
I
got
home
at
five
o'clock
,
and
found
that
Godalming
*NL*
and
Morris
had
not
only
arrived
,
but
had
already
studied
the
transcript
*NL*
of
the
various
diaries
and
letters
which
Harker
and
his
wonderful
wife
*NL*
had
made
and
arranged
.
Harker
had
not
yet
returned
from
his
visit
to
the
*NL*
carriers
'
men
,
of
whom
Dr.
Hennessey
had
written
to
me
.
Mrs.
Harker
gave
*NL*
us
a
cup
of
tea
,
and
I
can
honestly
say
that
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
*NL*
have
lived
in
it
,
this
old
house
seemed
like
_
home
_
.
When
we
had
*NL*
finished
,
Mrs.
Harker
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Seward
,
may
I
ask
a
favour
?
I
want
to
see
your
patient
,
Mr.
*NL*
Renfield
.
Do
let
me
see
him
.
What
you
have
said
of
him
in
your
diary
*NL*
interests
me
so
much
!
''
She
looked
so
appealing
and
so
pretty
that
I
*NL*
could
not
refuse
her
,
and
there
was
no
possible
reason
why
I
should
;
so
*NL*
I
took
her
with
me
.
When
I
went
into
the
room
,
I
told
the
man
that
a
*NL*
lady
would
like
to
see
him
;
to
which
he
simply
answered
:
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
going
through
the
house
,
and
wants
to
see
every
one
in
it
,
''
I
*NL*
answered
.
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
''
he
said
;
``
let
her
come
in
,
by
all
means
;
but
*NL*
just
wait
a
minute
till
I
tidy
up
the
place
.
''
His
method
of
tidying
was
*NL*
peculiar
:
he
simply
swallowed
all
the
flies
and
spiders
in
the
boxes
*NL*
before
I
could
stop
him
.
It
was
quite
evident
that
he
feared
,
or
was
*NL*
jealous
of
,
some
interference
.
When
he
had
got
through
his
disgusting
*NL*
task
,
he
said
cheerfully
:
``
Let
the
lady
come
in
,
''
and
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
edge
of
his
bed
with
his
head
down
,
but
with
his
eyelids
raised
so
that
*NL*
he
could
see
her
as
she
entered
.
For
a
moment
I
thought
that
he
might
*NL*
have
some
homicidal
intent
;
I
remembered
how
quiet
he
had
been
just
*NL*
before
he
attacked
me
in
my
own
study
,
and
I
took
care
to
stand
where
I
*NL*
could
seize
him
at
once
if
he
attempted
to
make
a
spring
at
her
.
She
*NL*
came
into
the
room
with
an
easy
gracefulness
which
would
at
once
command
*NL*
the
respect
of
any
lunatic
--
for
easiness
is
one
of
the
qualities
mad
*NL*
people
most
respect
.
She
walked
over
to
him
,
smiling
pleasantly
,
and
*NL*
held
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
,
Mr.
Renfield
,
''
said
she
.
``
You
see
,
I
know
you
,
for
Dr.
*NL*
Seward
has
told
me
of
you
.
''
He
made
no
immediate
reply
,
but
eyed
her
all
*NL*
over
intently
with
a
set
frown
on
his
face
.
This
look
gave
way
to
one
*NL*
of
wonder
,
which
merged
in
doubt
;
then
,
to
my
intense
astonishment
,
he
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
the
girl
the
doctor
wanted
to
marry
,
are
you
?
You
ca
n't
be
,
*NL*
you
know
,
for
she
's
dead
.
''
Mrs.
Harker
smiled
sweetly
as
she
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
I
have
a
husband
of
my
own
,
to
whom
I
was
married
before
I
ever
*NL*
saw
Dr.
Seward
,
or
he
me
.
I
am
Mrs.
Harker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
are
you
doing
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
and
I
are
staying
on
a
visit
with
Dr.
Seward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
not
?
''
I
thought
that
this
style
of
conversation
might
not
be
*NL*
pleasant
to
Mrs.
Harker
,
any
more
than
it
was
to
me
,
so
I
joined
in
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
know
I
wanted
to
marry
any
one
?
''
His
reply
was
simply
*NL*
contemptuous
,
given
in
a
pause
in
which
he
turned
his
eyes
from
Mrs.
*NL*
Harker
to
me
,
instantly
turning
them
back
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
asinine
question
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
that
at
all
,
Mr.
Renfield
,
''
said
Mrs.
Harker
,
at
once
*NL*
championing
me
.
He
replied
to
her
with
as
much
courtesy
and
respect
as
*NL*
he
had
shown
contempt
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
,
of
course
,
understand
,
Mrs.
Harker
,
that
when
a
man
is
so
*NL*
loved
and
honoured
as
our
host
is
,
everything
regarding
him
is
of
*NL*
interest
in
our
little
community
.
Dr.
Seward
is
loved
not
only
by
his
*NL*
household
and
his
friends
,
but
even
by
his
patients
,
who
,
being
some
of
*NL*
them
hardly
in
mental
equilibrium
,
are
apt
to
distort
causes
and
*NL*
effects
.
Since
I
myself
have
been
an
inmate
of
a
lunatic
asylum
,
I
*NL*
can
not
but
notice
that
the
sophistic
tendencies
of
some
of
its
inmates
*NL*
lean
towards
the
errors
of
_
non
causa
_
and
_
ignoratio
elenchi
_
.
''
I
*NL*
positively
opened
my
eyes
at
this
new
development
.
Here
was
my
own
pet
*NL*
lunatic
--
the
most
pronounced
of
his
type
that
I
had
ever
met
*NL*
with
--
talking
elemental
philosophy
,
and
with
the
manner
of
a
polished
*NL*
gentleman
.
I
wonder
if
it
was
Mrs.
Harker
's
presence
which
had
touched
*NL*
some
chord
in
his
memory
.
If
this
new
phase
was
spontaneous
,
or
in
any
*NL*
way
due
to
her
unconscious
influence
,
she
must
have
some
rare
gift
or
*NL*
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
continued
to
talk
for
some
time
;
and
,
seeing
that
he
was
seemingly
*NL*
quite
reasonable
,
she
ventured
,
looking
at
me
questioningly
as
she
*NL*
began
,
to
lead
him
to
his
favourite
topic
.
I
was
again
astonished
,
for
*NL*
he
addressed
himself
to
the
question
with
the
impartiality
of
the
*NL*
completest
sanity
;
he
even
took
himself
as
an
example
when
he
mentioned
*NL*
certain
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
myself
am
an
instance
of
a
man
who
had
a
strange
belief
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
it
was
no
wonder
that
my
friends
were
alarmed
,
and
insisted
on
my
being
*NL*
put
under
control
.
I
used
to
fancy
that
life
was
a
positive
and
*NL*
perpetual
entity
,
and
that
by
consuming
a
multitude
of
live
things
,
no
*NL*
matter
how
low
in
the
scale
of
creation
,
one
might
indefinitely
prolong
*NL*
life
.
At
times
I
held
the
belief
so
strongly
that
I
actually
tried
to
*NL*
take
human
life
.
The
doctor
here
will
bear
me
out
that
on
one
occasion
I
*NL*
tried
to
kill
him
for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
my
vital
powers
by
*NL*
the
assimilation
with
my
own
body
of
his
life
through
the
medium
of
his
*NL*
blood
--
relying
,
of
course
,
upon
the
Scriptural
phrase
,
`
For
the
blood
is
*NL*
the
life
.
'
Though
,
indeed
,
the
vendor
of
a
certain
nostrum
has
*NL*
vulgarised
the
truism
to
the
very
point
of
contempt
.
Is
n't
that
true
,
*NL*
doctor
?
''
I
nodded
assent
,
for
I
was
so
amazed
that
I
hardly
knew
what
to
*NL*
either
think
or
say
;
it
was
hard
to
imagine
that
I
had
seen
him
eat
up
*NL*
his
spiders
and
flies
not
five
minutes
before
.
Looking
at
my
watch
,
I
*NL*
saw
that
I
should
go
to
the
station
to
meet
Van
Helsing
,
so
I
told
Mrs.
*NL*
Harker
that
it
was
time
to
leave
.
She
came
at
once
,
after
saying
*NL*
pleasantly
to
Mr.
Renfield
:
``
Good-bye
,
and
I
hope
I
may
see
you
often
,
*NL*
under
auspices
pleasanter
to
yourself
,
''
to
which
,
to
my
astonishment
,
he
*NL*
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
my
dear
.
I
pray
God
I
may
never
see
your
sweet
face
again
.
*NL*
May
He
bless
and
keep
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
went
to
the
station
to
meet
Van
Helsing
I
left
the
boys
behind
*NL*
me
.
Poor
Art
seemed
more
cheerful
than
he
has
been
since
Lucy
first
took
*NL*
ill
,
and
Quincey
is
more
like
his
own
bright
self
than
he
has
been
for
*NL*
many
a
long
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
stepped
from
the
carriage
with
the
eager
nimbleness
of
a
*NL*
boy
.
He
saw
me
at
once
,
and
rushed
up
to
me
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
friend
John
,
how
goes
all
?
Well
?
So
!
I
have
been
busy
,
for
I
come
*NL*
here
to
stay
if
need
be
.
All
affairs
are
settled
with
me
,
and
I
have
*NL*
much
to
tell
.
Madam
Mina
is
with
you
?
Yes
.
And
her
so
fine
husband
?
And
*NL*
Arthur
and
my
friend
Quincey
,
they
are
with
you
,
too
?
Good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
drove
to
the
house
I
told
him
of
what
had
passed
,
and
of
how
my
own
*NL*
diary
had
come
to
be
of
some
use
through
Mrs.
Harker
's
suggestion
;
at
*NL*
which
the
Professor
interrupted
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
wonderful
Madam
Mina
!
She
has
man
's
brain
--
a
brain
that
a
man
*NL*
should
have
were
he
much
gifted
--
and
a
woman
's
heart
.
The
good
God
*NL*
fashioned
her
for
a
purpose
,
believe
me
,
when
He
made
that
so
good
*NL*
combination
.
Friend
John
,
up
to
now
fortune
has
made
that
woman
of
help
*NL*
to
us
;
after
to-night
she
must
not
have
to
do
with
this
so
terrible
*NL*
affair
.
It
is
not
good
that
she
run
a
risk
so
great
.
We
men
are
*NL*
determined
--
nay
,
are
we
not
pledged
?
--
to
destroy
this
monster
;
but
it
is
*NL*
no
part
for
a
woman
.
Even
if
she
be
not
harmed
,
her
heart
may
fail
her
*NL*
in
so
much
and
so
many
horrors
;
and
hereafter
she
may
suffer
--
both
in
*NL*
waking
,
from
her
nerves
,
and
in
sleep
,
from
her
dreams
.
And
,
besides
,
*NL*
she
is
young
woman
and
not
so
long
married
;
there
may
be
other
things
to
*NL*
think
of
some
time
,
if
not
now
.
You
tell
me
she
has
wrote
all
,
then
she
*NL*
must
consult
with
us
;
but
to-morrow
she
say
good-bye
to
this
work
,
and
*NL*
we
go
alone
.
''
I
agreed
heartily
with
him
,
and
then
I
told
him
what
we
*NL*
had
found
in
his
absence
:
that
the
house
which
Dracula
had
bought
was
*NL*
the
very
next
one
to
my
own
.
He
was
amazed
,
and
a
great
concern
seemed
*NL*
to
come
on
him
.
``
Oh
that
we
had
known
it
before
!
''
he
said
,
``
for
then
we
*NL*
might
have
reached
him
in
time
to
save
poor
Lucy
.
However
,
`
the
milk
*NL*
that
is
spilt
cries
not
out
afterwards
,
'
as
you
say
.
We
shall
not
think
*NL*
of
that
,
but
go
on
our
way
to
the
end
.
''
Then
he
fell
into
a
silence
that
*NL*
lasted
till
we
entered
my
own
gateway
.
Before
we
went
to
prepare
for
*NL*
dinner
he
said
to
Mrs.
Harker
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
told
,
Madam
Mina
,
by
my
friend
John
that
you
and
your
husband
have
*NL*
put
up
in
exact
order
all
things
that
have
been
,
up
to
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
up
to
this
moment
,
Professor
,
''
she
said
impulsively
,
``
but
up
to
*NL*
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
not
up
to
now
?
We
have
seen
hitherto
how
good
light
all
the
*NL*
little
things
have
made
.
We
have
told
our
secrets
,
and
yet
no
one
who
*NL*
has
told
is
the
worse
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Harker
began
to
blush
,
and
taking
a
paper
from
her
pockets
,
she
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
will
you
read
this
,
and
tell
me
if
it
must
go
in
.
It
*NL*
is
my
record
of
to-day
.
I
too
have
seen
the
need
of
putting
down
at
*NL*
present
everything
,
however
trivial
;
but
there
is
little
in
this
except
*NL*
what
is
personal
.
Must
it
go
in
?
''
The
Professor
read
it
over
gravely
,
*NL*
and
handed
it
back
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
need
not
go
in
if
you
do
not
wish
it
;
but
I
pray
that
it
may
.
It
can
*NL*
but
make
your
husband
love
you
the
more
,
and
all
us
,
your
friends
,
more
*NL*
honour
you
--
as
well
as
more
esteem
and
love
.
''
She
took
it
back
with
*NL*
another
blush
and
a
bright
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
now
,
up
to
this
very
hour
,
all
the
records
we
have
are
complete
*NL*
and
in
order
.
The
Professor
took
away
one
copy
to
study
after
dinner
,
*NL*
and
before
our
meeting
,
which
is
fixed
for
nine
o'clock
.
The
rest
of
us
*NL*
have
already
read
everything
;
so
when
we
meet
in
the
study
we
shall
all
*NL*
be
informed
as
to
facts
,
and
can
arrange
our
plan
of
battle
with
this
*NL*
terrible
and
mysterious
enemy
.

30
September
.
_
--
When
we
met
in
Dr.
Seward
's
study
two
hours
after
*NL*
dinner
,
which
had
been
at
six
o'clock
,
we
unconsciously
formed
a
sort
of
*NL*
board
or
committee
.
Professor
Van
Helsing
took
the
head
of
the
table
,
to
*NL*
which
Dr.
Seward
motioned
him
as
he
came
into
the
room
.
He
made
me
sit
*NL*
next
to
him
on
his
right
,
and
asked
me
to
act
as
secretary
;
Jonathan
sat
*NL*
next
to
me
.
Opposite
us
were
Lord
Godalming
,
Dr.
Seward
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Morris
--
Lord
Godalming
being
next
the
Professor
,
and
Dr.
Seward
in
the
*NL*
centre
.
The
Professor
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
,
I
suppose
,
take
it
that
we
are
all
acquainted
with
the
facts
*NL*
that
are
in
these
papers
.
''
We
all
expressed
assent
,
and
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
were
,
I
think
good
that
I
tell
you
something
of
the
kind
of
*NL*
enemy
with
which
we
have
to
deal
.
I
shall
then
make
known
to
you
*NL*
something
of
the
history
of
this
man
,
which
has
been
ascertained
for
me
.
*NL*
So
we
then
can
discuss
how
we
shall
act
,
and
can
take
our
measure
*NL*
according
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
such
beings
as
vampires
;
some
of
us
have
evidence
that
they
*NL*
exist
.
Even
had
we
not
the
proof
of
our
own
unhappy
experience
,
the
*NL*
teachings
and
the
records
of
the
past
give
proof
enough
for
sane
*NL*
peoples
.
I
admit
that
at
the
first
I
was
sceptic
.
Were
it
not
that
*NL*
through
long
years
I
have
train
myself
to
keep
an
open
mind
,
I
could
not
*NL*
have
believe
until
such
time
as
that
fact
thunder
on
my
ear
.
`
See
!
see
!
*NL*
I
prove
;
I
prove
.
'
Alas
!
Had
I
known
at
the
first
what
now
I
know
--
nay
,
*NL*
had
I
even
guess
at
him
--
one
so
precious
life
had
been
spared
to
many
of
*NL*
us
who
did
love
her
.
But
that
is
gone
;
and
we
must
so
work
,
that
other
*NL*
poor
souls
perish
not
,
whilst
we
can
save
.
The
_
nosferatu
_
do
not
die
*NL*
like
the
bee
when
he
sting
once
.
He
is
only
stronger
;
and
being
*NL*
stronger
,
have
yet
more
power
to
work
evil
.
This
vampire
which
is
*NL*
amongst
us
is
of
himself
so
strong
in
person
as
twenty
men
;
he
is
of
*NL*
cunning
more
than
mortal
,
for
his
cunning
be
the
growth
of
ages
;
he
have
*NL*
still
the
aids
of
necromancy
,
which
is
,
as
his
etymology
imply
,
the
*NL*
divination
by
the
dead
,
and
all
the
dead
that
he
can
come
nigh
to
are
*NL*
for
him
at
command
;
he
is
brute
,
and
more
than
brute
;
he
is
devil
in
*NL*
callous
,
and
the
heart
of
him
is
not
;
he
can
,
within
limitations
,
appear
*NL*
at
will
when
,
and
where
,
and
in
any
of
the
forms
that
are
to
him
;
he
*NL*
can
,
within
his
range
,
direct
the
elements
;
the
storm
,
the
fog
,
the
*NL*
thunder
;
he
can
command
all
the
meaner
things
:
the
rat
,
and
the
owl
,
and
*NL*
the
bat
--
the
moth
,
and
the
fox
,
and
the
wolf
;
he
can
grow
and
become
*NL*
small
;
and
he
can
at
times
vanish
and
come
unknown
.
How
then
are
we
to
*NL*
begin
our
strike
to
destroy
him
?
How
shall
we
find
his
where
;
and
having
*NL*
found
it
,
how
can
we
destroy
?
My
friends
,
this
is
much
;
it
is
a
terrible
*NL*
task
that
we
undertake
,
and
there
may
be
consequence
to
make
the
brave
*NL*
shudder
.
For
if
we
fail
in
this
our
fight
he
must
surely
win
;
and
then
*NL*
where
end
we
?
Life
is
nothings
;
I
heed
him
not
.
But
to
fail
here
,
is
not
*NL*
mere
life
or
death
.
It
is
that
we
become
as
him
;
that
we
henceforward
*NL*
become
foul
things
of
the
night
like
him
--
without
heart
or
conscience
,
*NL*
preying
on
the
bodies
and
the
souls
of
those
we
love
best
.
To
us
for
*NL*
ever
are
the
gates
of
heaven
shut
;
for
who
shall
open
them
to
us
again
?
*NL*
We
go
on
for
all
time
abhorred
by
all
;
a
blot
on
the
face
of
God
's
*NL*
sunshine
;
an
arrow
in
the
side
of
Him
who
died
for
man
.
But
we
are
face
*NL*
to
face
with
duty
;
and
in
such
case
must
we
shrink
?
For
me
,
I
say
,
no
;
*NL*
but
then
I
am
old
,
and
life
,
with
his
sunshine
,
his
fair
places
,
his
*NL*
song
of
birds
,
his
music
and
his
love
,
lie
far
behind
.
You
others
are
*NL*
young
.
Some
have
seen
sorrow
;
but
there
are
fair
days
yet
in
store
.
What
*NL*
say
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
he
was
speaking
,
Jonathan
had
taken
my
hand
.
I
feared
,
oh
so
*NL*
much
,
that
the
appalling
nature
of
our
danger
was
overcoming
him
when
I
*NL*
saw
his
hand
stretch
out
;
but
it
was
life
to
me
to
feel
its
touch
--
so
*NL*
strong
,
so
self-reliant
,
so
resolute
.
A
brave
man
's
hand
can
speak
for
*NL*
itself
;
it
does
not
even
need
a
woman
's
love
to
hear
its
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Professor
had
done
speaking
my
husband
looked
in
my
eyes
,
and
I
*NL*
in
his
;
there
was
no
need
for
speaking
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
answer
for
Mina
and
myself
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
me
in
,
Professor
,
''
said
Mr.
Quincey
Morris
,
laconically
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
with
you
,
''
said
Lord
Godalming
,
``
for
Lucy
's
sake
,
if
for
no
other
*NL*
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Seward
simply
nodded
.
The
Professor
stood
up
and
,
after
laying
his
*NL*
golden
crucifix
on
the
table
,
held
out
his
hand
on
either
side
.
I
took
*NL*
his
right
hand
,
and
Lord
Godalming
his
left
;
Jonathan
held
my
right
with
*NL*
his
left
and
stretched
across
to
Mr.
Morris
.
So
as
we
all
took
hands
our
*NL*
solemn
compact
was
made
.
I
felt
my
heart
icy
cold
,
but
it
did
not
even
*NL*
occur
to
me
to
draw
back
.
We
resumed
our
places
,
and
Dr.
Van
Helsing
*NL*
went
on
with
a
sort
of
cheerfulness
which
showed
that
the
serious
work
*NL*
had
begun
.
It
was
to
be
taken
as
gravely
,
and
in
as
businesslike
a
way
,
*NL*
as
any
other
transaction
of
life
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
what
we
have
to
contend
against
;
but
we
,
too
,
are
not
*NL*
without
strength
.
We
have
on
our
side
power
of
combination
--
a
power
*NL*
denied
to
the
vampire
kind
;
we
have
sources
of
science
;
we
are
free
to
*NL*
act
and
think
;
and
the
hours
of
the
day
and
the
night
are
ours
equally
.
*NL*
In
fact
,
so
far
as
our
powers
extend
,
they
are
unfettered
,
and
we
are
*NL*
free
to
use
them
.
We
have
self-devotion
in
a
cause
,
and
an
end
to
*NL*
achieve
which
is
not
a
selfish
one
.
These
things
are
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
us
see
how
far
the
general
powers
arrayed
against
us
are
*NL*
restrict
,
and
how
the
individual
can
not
.
In
fine
,
let
us
consider
the
*NL*
limitations
of
the
vampire
in
general
,
and
of
this
one
in
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
we
have
to
go
upon
are
traditions
and
superstitions
.
These
do
not
*NL*
at
the
first
appear
much
,
when
the
matter
is
one
of
life
and
death
--
nay
*NL*
of
more
than
either
life
or
death
.
Yet
must
we
be
satisfied
;
in
the
*NL*
first
place
because
we
have
to
be
--
no
other
means
is
at
our
control
--
and
*NL*
secondly
,
because
,
after
all
,
these
things
--
tradition
and
*NL*
superstition
--
are
everything
.
Does
not
the
belief
in
vampires
rest
for
*NL*
others
--
though
not
,
alas
!
for
us
--
on
them
?
A
year
ago
which
of
us
would
*NL*
have
received
such
a
possibility
,
in
the
midst
of
our
scientific
,
*NL*
sceptical
,
matter-of-fact
nineteenth
century
?
We
even
scouted
a
belief
*NL*
that
we
saw
justified
under
our
very
eyes
.
Take
it
,
then
,
that
the
*NL*
vampire
,
and
the
belief
in
his
limitations
and
his
cure
,
rest
for
the
*NL*
moment
on
the
same
base
.
For
,
let
me
tell
you
,
he
is
known
everywhere
*NL*
that
men
have
been
.
In
old
Greece
,
in
old
Rome
;
he
flourish
in
Germany
*NL*
all
over
,
in
France
,
in
India
,
even
in
the
Chernosese
;
and
in
China
,
so
*NL*
far
from
us
in
all
ways
,
there
even
is
he
,
and
the
peoples
fear
him
at
*NL*
this
day
.
He
have
follow
the
wake
of
the
berserker
Icelander
,
the
*NL*
devil-begotten
Hun
,
the
Slav
,
the
Saxon
,
the
Magyar
.
So
far
,
then
,
we
*NL*
have
all
we
may
act
upon
;
and
let
me
tell
you
that
very
much
of
the
*NL*
beliefs
are
justified
by
what
we
have
seen
in
our
own
so
unhappy
*NL*
experience
.
The
vampire
live
on
,
and
can
not
die
by
mere
passing
of
the
*NL*
time
;
he
can
flourish
when
that
he
can
fatten
on
the
blood
of
the
*NL*
living
.
Even
more
,
we
have
seen
amongst
us
that
he
can
even
grow
*NL*
younger
;
that
his
vital
faculties
grow
strenuous
,
and
seem
as
though
*NL*
they
refresh
themselves
when
his
special
pabulum
is
plenty
.
But
he
*NL*
can
not
flourish
without
this
diet
;
he
eat
not
as
others
.
Even
friend
*NL*
Jonathan
,
who
lived
with
him
for
weeks
,
did
never
see
him
to
eat
,
never
!
*NL*
He
throws
no
shadow
;
he
make
in
the
mirror
no
reflect
,
as
again
*NL*
Jonathan
observe
.
He
has
the
strength
of
many
of
his
hand
--
witness
again
*NL*
Jonathan
when
he
shut
the
door
against
the
wolfs
,
and
when
he
help
him
*NL*
from
the
diligence
too
.
He
can
transform
himself
to
wolf
,
as
we
gather
*NL*
from
the
ship
arrival
in
Whitby
,
when
he
tear
open
the
dog
;
he
can
be
as
*NL*
bat
,
as
Madam
Mina
saw
him
on
the
window
at
Whitby
,
and
as
friend
John
*NL*
saw
him
fly
from
this
so
near
house
,
and
as
my
friend
Quincey
saw
him
at
*NL*
the
window
of
Miss
Lucy
.
He
can
come
in
mist
which
he
create
--
that
noble
*NL*
ship
's
captain
proved
him
of
this
;
but
,
from
what
we
know
,
the
distance
*NL*
he
can
make
this
mist
is
limited
,
and
it
can
only
be
round
himself
.
He
*NL*
come
on
moonlight
rays
as
elemental
dust
--
as
again
Jonathan
saw
those
*NL*
sisters
in
the
castle
of
Dracula
.
He
become
so
small
--
we
ourselves
saw
*NL*
Miss
Lucy
,
ere
she
was
at
peace
,
slip
through
a
hairbreadth
space
at
the
*NL*
tomb
door
.
He
can
,
when
once
he
find
his
way
,
come
out
from
anything
or
*NL*
into
anything
,
no
matter
how
close
it
be
bound
or
even
fused
up
with
*NL*
fire
--
solder
you
call
it
.
He
can
see
in
the
dark
--
no
small
power
this
,
*NL*
in
a
world
which
is
one
half
shut
from
the
light
.
Ah
,
but
hear
me
*NL*
through
.
He
can
do
all
these
things
,
yet
he
is
not
free
.
Nay
;
he
is
even
*NL*
more
prisoner
than
the
slave
of
the
galley
,
than
the
madman
in
his
cell
.
*NL*
He
can
not
go
where
he
lists
;
he
who
is
not
of
nature
has
yet
to
obey
*NL*
some
of
nature
's
laws
--
why
we
know
not
.
He
may
not
enter
anywhere
at
the
*NL*
first
,
unless
there
be
some
one
of
the
household
who
bid
him
to
come
;
*NL*
though
afterwards
he
can
come
as
he
please
.
His
power
ceases
,
as
does
*NL*
that
of
all
evil
things
,
at
the
coming
of
the
day
.
Only
at
certain
times
*NL*
can
he
have
limited
freedom
.
If
he
be
not
at
the
place
whither
he
is
*NL*
bound
,
he
can
only
change
himself
at
noon
or
at
exact
sunrise
or
sunset
.
*NL*
These
things
are
we
told
,
and
in
this
record
of
ours
we
have
proof
by
*NL*
inference
.
Thus
,
whereas
he
can
do
as
he
will
within
his
limit
,
when
he
*NL*
have
his
earth-home
,
his
coffin-home
,
his
hell-home
,
the
place
*NL*
unhallowed
,
as
we
saw
when
he
went
to
the
grave
of
the
suicide
at
*NL*
Whitby
;
still
at
other
time
he
can
only
change
when
the
time
come
.
It
is
*NL*
said
,
too
,
that
he
can
only
pass
running
water
at
the
slack
or
the
flood
*NL*
of
the
tide
.
Then
there
are
things
which
so
afflict
him
that
he
has
no
*NL*
power
,
as
the
garlic
that
we
know
of
;
and
as
for
things
sacred
,
as
this
*NL*
symbol
,
my
crucifix
,
that
was
amongst
us
even
now
when
we
resolve
,
to
*NL*
them
he
is
nothing
,
but
in
their
presence
he
take
his
place
far
off
and
*NL*
silent
with
respect
.
There
are
others
,
too
,
which
I
shall
tell
you
of
,
*NL*
lest
in
our
seeking
we
may
need
them
.
The
branch
of
wild
rose
on
his
*NL*
coffin
keep
him
that
he
move
not
from
it
;
a
sacred
bullet
fired
into
the
*NL*
coffin
kill
him
so
that
he
be
true
dead
;
and
as
for
the
stake
through
*NL*
him
,
we
know
already
of
its
peace
;
or
the
cut-off
head
that
giveth
rest
.
*NL*
We
have
seen
it
with
our
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
when
we
find
the
habitation
of
this
man-that-was
,
we
can
confine
*NL*
him
to
his
coffin
and
destroy
him
,
if
we
obey
what
we
know
.
But
he
is
*NL*
clever
.
I
have
asked
my
friend
Arminius
,
of
Buda-Pesth
University
,
to
*NL*
make
his
record
;
and
,
from
all
the
means
that
are
,
he
tell
me
of
what
he
*NL*
has
been
.
He
must
,
indeed
,
have
been
that
Voivode
Dracula
who
won
his
*NL*
name
against
the
Turk
,
over
the
great
river
on
the
very
frontier
of
*NL*
Turkey-land
.
If
it
be
so
,
then
was
he
no
common
man
;
for
in
that
time
,
*NL*
and
for
centuries
after
,
he
was
spoken
of
as
the
cleverest
and
the
most
*NL*
cunning
,
as
well
as
the
bravest
of
the
sons
of
the
`
land
beyond
the
*NL*
forest
.
'
That
mighty
brain
and
that
iron
resolution
went
with
him
to
his
*NL*
grave
,
and
are
even
now
arrayed
against
us
.
The
Draculas
were
,
says
*NL*
Arminius
,
a
great
and
noble
race
,
though
now
and
again
were
scions
who
*NL*
were
held
by
their
coevals
to
have
had
dealings
with
the
Evil
One
.
They
*NL*
learned
his
secrets
in
the
Scholomance
,
amongst
the
mountains
over
Lake
*NL*
Hermanstadt
,
where
the
devil
claims
the
tenth
scholar
as
his
due
.
In
the
*NL*
records
are
such
words
as
`
stregoica
'
--
witch
,
`
ordog
,
'
and
*NL*
`
pokol
'
--
Satan
and
hell
;
and
in
one
manuscript
this
very
Dracula
is
*NL*
spoken
of
as
`
wampyr
,
'
which
we
all
understand
too
well
.
There
have
been
*NL*
from
the
loins
of
this
very
one
great
men
and
good
women
,
and
their
*NL*
graves
make
sacred
the
earth
where
alone
this
foulness
can
dwell
.
For
it
*NL*
is
not
the
least
of
its
terrors
that
this
evil
thing
is
rooted
deep
in
*NL*
all
good
;
in
soil
barren
of
holy
memories
it
can
not
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
they
were
talking
Mr.
Morris
was
looking
steadily
at
the
window
,
*NL*
and
he
now
got
up
quietly
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
There
was
a
little
*NL*
pause
,
and
then
the
Professor
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
we
must
settle
what
we
do
.
We
have
here
much
data
,
and
we
must
*NL*
proceed
to
lay
out
our
campaign
.
We
know
from
the
inquiry
of
Jonathan
*NL*
that
from
the
castle
to
Whitby
came
fifty
boxes
of
earth
,
all
of
which
*NL*
were
delivered
at
Carfax
;
we
also
know
that
at
least
some
of
these
boxes
*NL*
have
been
removed
.
It
seems
to
me
,
that
our
first
step
should
be
to
*NL*
ascertain
whether
all
the
rest
remain
in
the
house
beyond
that
wall
*NL*
where
we
look
to-day
;
or
whether
any
more
have
been
removed
.
If
the
*NL*
latter
,
we
must
trace
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
we
were
interrupted
in
a
very
startling
way
.
Outside
the
house
came
*NL*
the
sound
of
a
pistol-shot
;
the
glass
of
the
window
was
shattered
with
a
*NL*
bullet
,
which
,
ricochetting
from
the
top
of
the
embrasure
,
struck
the
*NL*
far
wall
of
the
room
.
I
am
afraid
I
am
at
heart
a
coward
,
for
I
shrieked
*NL*
out
.
The
men
all
jumped
to
their
feet
;
Lord
Godalming
flew
over
to
the
*NL*
window
and
threw
up
the
sash
.
As
he
did
so
we
heard
Mr.
Morris
's
voice
*NL*
without
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
!
I
fear
I
have
alarmed
you
.
I
shall
come
in
and
tell
you
about
*NL*
it
.
''
A
minute
later
he
came
in
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
an
idiotic
thing
of
me
to
do
,
and
I
ask
your
pardon
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Harker
,
most
sincerely
;
I
fear
I
must
have
frightened
you
terribly
.
But
*NL*
the
fact
is
that
whilst
the
Professor
was
talking
there
came
a
big
bat
*NL*
and
sat
on
the
window-sill
.
I
have
got
such
a
horror
of
the
damned
*NL*
brutes
from
recent
events
that
I
can
not
stand
them
,
and
I
went
out
to
*NL*
have
a
shot
,
as
I
have
been
doing
of
late
of
evenings
,
whenever
I
have
*NL*
seen
one
.
You
used
to
laugh
at
me
for
it
then
,
Art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hit
it
?
''
asked
Dr.
Van
Helsing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
fancy
not
,
for
it
flew
away
into
the
wood
.
''
Without
*NL*
saying
any
more
he
took
his
seat
,
and
the
Professor
began
to
resume
his
*NL*
statement
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
trace
each
of
these
boxes
;
and
when
we
are
ready
,
we
must
*NL*
either
capture
or
kill
this
monster
in
his
lair
;
or
we
must
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
sterilise
the
earth
,
so
that
no
more
he
can
seek
safety
in
it
.
*NL*
Thus
in
the
end
we
may
find
him
in
his
form
of
man
between
the
hours
of
*NL*
noon
and
sunset
,
and
so
engage
with
him
when
he
is
at
his
most
weak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
for
you
,
Madam
Mina
,
this
night
is
the
end
until
all
be
well
.
*NL*
You
are
too
precious
to
us
to
have
such
risk
.
When
we
part
to-night
,
you
*NL*
no
more
must
question
.
We
shall
tell
you
all
in
good
time
.
We
are
men
*NL*
and
are
able
to
bear
;
but
you
must
be
our
star
and
our
hope
,
and
we
*NL*
shall
act
all
the
more
free
that
you
are
not
in
the
danger
,
such
as
we
*NL*
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
men
,
even
Jonathan
,
seemed
relieved
;
but
it
did
not
seem
to
me
*NL*
good
that
they
should
brave
danger
and
,
perhaps
,
lessen
their
*NL*
safety
--
strength
being
the
best
safety
--
through
care
of
me
;
but
their
*NL*
minds
were
made
up
,
and
,
though
it
was
a
bitter
pill
for
me
to
swallow
,
*NL*
I
could
say
nothing
,
save
to
accept
their
chivalrous
care
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Morris
resumed
the
discussion
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
there
is
no
time
to
lose
,
I
vote
we
have
a
look
at
his
house
right
*NL*
now
.
Time
is
everything
with
him
;
and
swift
action
on
our
part
may
save
*NL*
another
victim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
own
that
my
heart
began
to
fail
me
when
the
time
for
action
came
so
*NL*
close
,
but
I
did
not
say
anything
,
for
I
had
a
greater
fear
that
if
I
*NL*
appeared
as
a
drag
or
a
hindrance
to
their
work
,
they
might
even
leave
*NL*
me
out
of
their
counsels
altogether
.
They
have
now
gone
off
to
Carfax
,
*NL*
with
means
to
get
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Manlike
,
they
had
told
me
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
;
as
if
a
woman
can
*NL*
sleep
when
those
she
loves
are
in
danger
!
I
shall
lie
down
and
pretend
*NL*
to
sleep
,
lest
Jonathan
have
added
anxiety
about
me
when
he
returns

1
October
,
4
a.
m.
_
--
Just
as
we
were
about
to
leave
the
house
,
an
*NL*
urgent
message
was
brought
to
me
from
Renfield
to
know
if
I
would
see
*NL*
him
at
once
,
as
he
had
something
of
the
utmost
importance
to
say
to
me
.
*NL*
I
told
the
messenger
to
say
that
I
would
attend
to
his
wishes
in
the
*NL*
morning
;
I
was
busy
just
at
the
moment
.
The
attendant
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seems
very
importunate
,
sir
.
I
have
never
seen
him
so
eager
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
but
what
,
if
you
do
n't
see
him
soon
,
he
will
have
one
of
his
*NL*
violent
fits
.
''
I
knew
the
man
would
not
have
said
this
without
some
*NL*
cause
,
so
I
said
:
``
All
right
;
I
'll
go
now
''
;
and
I
asked
the
others
to
*NL*
wait
a
few
minutes
for
me
,
as
I
had
to
go
and
see
my
``
patient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
me
with
you
,
friend
John
,
''
said
the
Professor
.
``
His
case
in
your
*NL*
diary
interest
me
much
,
and
it
had
bearing
,
too
,
now
and
again
on
_
our
_
*NL*
case
.
I
should
much
like
to
see
him
,
and
especial
when
his
mind
is
*NL*
disturbed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
come
also
?
''
asked
Lord
Godalming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
too
?
''
said
Quincey
Morris
.
``
May
I
come
?
''
said
Harker
.
I
nodded
,
and
*NL*
we
all
went
down
the
passage
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
him
in
a
state
of
considerable
excitement
,
but
far
more
*NL*
rational
in
his
speech
and
manner
than
I
had
ever
seen
him
.
There
was
an
*NL*
unusual
understanding
of
himself
,
which
was
unlike
anything
I
had
ever
*NL*
met
with
in
a
lunatic
;
and
he
took
it
for
granted
that
his
reasons
would
*NL*
prevail
with
others
entirely
sane
.
We
all
four
went
into
the
room
,
but
*NL*
none
of
the
others
at
first
said
anything
.
His
request
was
that
I
would
*NL*
at
once
release
him
from
the
asylum
and
send
him
home
.
This
he
backed
up
*NL*
with
arguments
regarding
his
complete
recovery
,
and
adduced
his
own
*NL*
existing
sanity
.
``
I
appeal
to
your
friends
,
''
he
said
,
``
they
will
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
not
mind
sitting
in
judgment
on
my
case
.
By
the
way
,
you
have
*NL*
not
introduced
me
.
''
I
was
so
much
astonished
,
that
the
oddness
of
*NL*
introducing
a
madman
in
an
asylum
did
not
strike
me
at
the
moment
;
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
there
was
a
certain
dignity
in
the
man
's
manner
,
so
much
of
*NL*
the
habit
of
equality
,
that
I
at
once
made
the
introduction
:
``
Lord
*NL*
Godalming
;
Professor
Van
Helsing
;
Mr.
Quincey
Morris
,
of
Texas
;
Mr.
*NL*
Renfield
.
''
He
shook
hands
with
each
of
them
,
saying
in
turn
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
Godalming
,
I
had
the
honour
of
seconding
your
father
at
the
*NL*
Windham
;
I
grieve
to
know
,
by
your
holding
the
title
,
that
he
is
no
*NL*
more
.
He
was
a
man
loved
and
honoured
by
all
who
knew
him
;
and
in
his
*NL*
youth
was
,
I
have
heard
,
the
inventor
of
a
burnt
rum
punch
,
much
*NL*
patronised
on
Derby
night
.
Mr.
Morris
,
you
should
be
proud
of
your
great
*NL*
state
.
Its
reception
into
the
Union
was
a
precedent
which
may
have
*NL*
far-reaching
effects
hereafter
,
when
the
Pole
and
the
Tropics
may
hold
*NL*
alliance
to
the
Stars
and
Stripes
.
The
power
of
Treaty
may
yet
prove
a
*NL*
vast
engine
of
enlargement
,
when
the
Monroe
doctrine
takes
its
true
*NL*
place
as
a
political
fable
.
What
shall
any
man
say
of
his
pleasure
at
*NL*
meeting
Van
Helsing
?
Sir
,
I
make
no
apology
for
dropping
all
forms
of
*NL*
conventional
prefix
.
When
an
individual
has
revolutionised
therapeutics
*NL*
by
his
discovery
of
the
continuous
evolution
of
brain-matter
,
*NL*
conventional
forms
are
unfitting
,
since
they
would
seem
to
limit
him
to
*NL*
one
of
a
class
.
You
,
gentlemen
,
who
by
nationality
,
by
heredity
,
or
by
*NL*
the
possession
of
natural
gifts
,
are
fitted
to
hold
your
respective
*NL*
places
in
the
moving
world
,
I
take
to
witness
that
I
am
as
sane
as
at
*NL*
least
the
majority
of
men
who
are
in
full
possession
of
their
liberties
.
*NL*
And
I
am
sure
that
you
,
Dr.
Seward
,
humanitarian
and
medico-jurist
as
*NL*
well
as
scientist
,
will
deem
it
a
moral
duty
to
deal
with
me
as
one
to
*NL*
be
considered
as
under
exceptional
circumstances
.
''
He
made
this
last
*NL*
appeal
with
a
courtly
air
of
conviction
which
was
not
without
its
own
*NL*
charm
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
we
were
all
staggered
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
was
under
the
*NL*
conviction
,
despite
my
knowledge
of
the
man
's
character
and
history
,
*NL*
that
his
reason
had
been
restored
;
and
I
felt
under
a
strong
impulse
to
*NL*
tell
him
that
I
was
satisfied
as
to
his
sanity
,
and
would
see
about
the
*NL*
necessary
formalities
for
his
release
in
the
morning
.
I
thought
it
*NL*
better
to
wait
,
however
,
before
making
so
grave
a
statement
,
for
of
old
*NL*
I
knew
the
sudden
changes
to
which
this
particular
patient
was
liable
.
*NL*
So
I
contented
myself
with
making
a
general
statement
that
he
appeared
*NL*
to
be
improving
very
rapidly
;
that
I
would
have
a
longer
chat
with
him
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
and
would
then
see
what
I
could
do
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
meeting
his
wishes
.
This
did
not
at
all
satisfy
him
,
for
he
said
*NL*
quickly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
fear
,
Dr.
Seward
,
that
you
hardly
apprehend
my
wish
.
I
desire
to
*NL*
go
at
once
--
here
--
now
--
this
very
hour
--
this
very
moment
,
if
I
may
.
Time
*NL*
presses
,
and
in
our
implied
agreement
with
the
old
scytheman
it
is
of
*NL*
the
essence
of
the
contract
.
I
am
sure
it
is
only
necessary
to
put
*NL*
before
so
admirable
a
practitioner
as
Dr.
Seward
so
simple
,
yet
so
*NL*
momentous
a
wish
,
to
ensure
its
fulfilment
.
''
He
looked
at
me
keenly
,
and
*NL*
seeing
the
negative
in
my
face
,
turned
to
the
others
,
and
scrutinised
*NL*
them
closely
.
Not
meeting
any
sufficient
response
,
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
that
I
have
erred
in
my
supposition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
,
''
I
said
frankly
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
as
I
felt
,
brutally
.
*NL*
There
was
a
considerable
pause
,
and
then
he
said
slowly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
suppose
I
must
only
shift
my
ground
of
request
.
Let
me
ask
for
*NL*
this
concession
--
boon
,
privilege
,
what
you
will
.
I
am
content
to
implore
*NL*
in
such
a
case
,
not
on
personal
grounds
,
but
for
the
sake
of
others
.
I
*NL*
am
not
at
liberty
to
give
you
the
whole
of
my
reasons
;
but
you
may
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
take
it
from
me
that
they
are
good
ones
,
sound
and
*NL*
unselfish
,
and
spring
from
the
highest
sense
of
duty
.
Could
you
look
,
*NL*
sir
,
into
my
heart
,
you
would
approve
to
the
full
the
sentiments
which
*NL*
animate
me
.
Nay
,
more
,
you
would
count
me
amongst
the
best
and
truest
of
*NL*
your
friends
.
''
Again
he
looked
at
us
all
keenly
.
I
had
a
growing
*NL*
conviction
that
this
sudden
change
of
his
entire
intellectual
method
was
*NL*
but
yet
another
form
or
phase
of
his
madness
,
and
so
determined
to
let
*NL*
him
go
on
a
little
longer
,
knowing
from
experience
that
he
would
,
like
*NL*
all
lunatics
,
give
himself
away
in
the
end
.
Van
Helsing
was
gazing
at
*NL*
him
with
a
look
of
utmost
intensity
,
his
bushy
eyebrows
almost
meeting
*NL*
with
the
fixed
concentration
of
his
look
.
He
said
to
Renfield
in
a
tone
*NL*
which
did
not
surprise
me
at
the
time
,
but
only
when
I
thought
of
it
*NL*
afterwards
--
for
it
was
as
of
one
addressing
an
equal
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
not
tell
frankly
your
real
reason
for
wishing
to
be
free
*NL*
to-night
?
I
will
undertake
that
if
you
will
satisfy
even
me
--
a
stranger
,
*NL*
without
prejudice
,
and
with
the
habit
of
keeping
an
open
mind
--
Dr.
*NL*
Seward
will
give
you
,
at
his
own
risk
and
on
his
own
responsibility
,
the
*NL*
privilege
you
seek
.
''
He
shook
his
head
sadly
,
and
with
a
look
of
*NL*
poignant
regret
on
his
face
.
The
Professor
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
sir
,
bethink
yourself
.
You
claim
the
privilege
of
reason
in
the
*NL*
highest
degree
,
since
you
seek
to
impress
us
with
your
complete
*NL*
reasonableness
.
You
do
this
,
whose
sanity
we
have
reason
to
doubt
,
since
*NL*
you
are
not
yet
released
from
medical
treatment
for
this
very
defect
.
If
*NL*
you
will
not
help
us
in
our
effort
to
choose
the
wisest
course
,
how
can
*NL*
we
perform
the
duty
which
you
yourself
put
upon
us
?
Be
wise
,
and
help
*NL*
us
;
and
if
we
can
we
shall
aid
you
to
achieve
your
wish
.
''
He
still
shook
*NL*
his
head
as
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
.
Your
argument
is
complete
,
and
*NL*
if
I
were
free
to
speak
I
should
not
hesitate
a
moment
;
but
I
am
not
my
*NL*
own
master
in
the
matter
.
I
can
only
ask
you
to
trust
me
.
If
I
am
*NL*
refused
,
the
responsibility
does
not
rest
with
me
.
''
I
thought
it
was
now
*NL*
time
to
end
the
scene
,
which
was
becoming
too
comically
grave
,
so
I
went
*NL*
towards
the
door
,
simply
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
friends
,
we
have
work
to
do
.
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
,
however
,
I
got
near
the
door
,
a
new
change
came
over
the
patient
.
He
*NL*
moved
towards
me
so
quickly
that
for
the
moment
I
feared
that
he
was
*NL*
about
to
make
another
homicidal
attack
.
My
fears
,
however
,
were
*NL*
groundless
,
for
he
held
up
his
two
hands
imploringly
,
and
made
his
*NL*
petition
in
a
moving
manner
.
As
he
saw
that
the
very
excess
of
his
*NL*
emotion
was
militating
against
him
,
by
restoring
us
more
to
our
old
*NL*
relations
,
he
became
still
more
demonstrative
.
I
glanced
at
Van
Helsing
,
*NL*
and
saw
my
conviction
reflected
in
his
eyes
;
so
I
became
a
little
more
*NL*
fixed
in
my
manner
,
if
not
more
stern
,
and
motioned
to
him
that
his
*NL*
efforts
were
unavailing
.
I
had
previously
seen
something
of
the
same
*NL*
constantly
growing
excitement
in
him
when
he
had
to
make
some
request
of
*NL*
which
at
the
time
he
had
thought
much
,
such
,
for
instance
,
as
when
he
*NL*
wanted
a
cat
;
and
I
was
prepared
to
see
the
collapse
into
the
same
*NL*
sullen
acquiescence
on
this
occasion
.
My
expectation
was
not
realised
,
*NL*
for
,
when
he
found
that
his
appeal
would
not
be
successful
,
he
got
into
*NL*
quite
a
frantic
condition
.
He
threw
himself
on
his
knees
,
and
held
up
*NL*
his
hands
,
wringing
them
in
plaintive
supplication
,
and
poured
forth
a
*NL*
torrent
of
entreaty
,
with
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
,
and
his
*NL*
whole
face
and
form
expressive
of
the
deepest
emotion
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
entreat
you
,
Dr.
Seward
,
oh
,
let
me
implore
you
,
to
let
me
out
*NL*
of
this
house
at
once
.
Send
me
away
how
you
will
and
where
you
will
;
*NL*
send
keepers
with
me
with
whips
and
chains
;
let
them
take
me
in
a
*NL*
strait-waistcoat
,
manacled
and
leg-ironed
,
even
to
a
gaol
;
but
let
me
go
*NL*
out
of
this
.
You
do
n't
know
what
you
do
by
keeping
me
here
.
I
am
*NL*
speaking
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
--
of
my
very
soul
.
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
whom
you
wrong
,
or
how
;
and
I
may
not
tell
.
Woe
is
me
!
I
may
not
tell
.
*NL*
By
all
you
hold
sacred
--
by
all
you
hold
dear
--
by
your
love
that
is
*NL*
lost
--
by
your
hope
that
lives
--
for
the
sake
of
the
Almighty
,
take
me
out
*NL*
of
this
and
save
my
soul
from
guilt
!
Ca
n't
you
hear
me
,
man
?
Ca
n't
you
*NL*
understand
?
Will
you
never
learn
?
Do
n't
you
know
that
I
am
sane
and
*NL*
earnest
now
;
that
I
am
no
lunatic
in
a
mad
fit
,
but
a
sane
man
fighting
*NL*
for
his
soul
?
Oh
,
hear
me
!
hear
me
!
Let
me
go
!
let
me
go
!
let
me
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
that
the
longer
this
went
on
the
wilder
he
would
get
,
and
so
*NL*
would
bring
on
a
fit
;
so
I
took
him
by
the
hand
and
raised
him
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
I
said
sternly
,
``
no
more
of
this
;
we
have
had
quite
enough
*NL*
already
.
Get
to
your
bed
and
try
to
behave
more
discreetly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
stopped
and
looked
at
me
intently
for
several
moments
.
Then
,
*NL*
without
a
word
,
he
rose
and
moving
over
,
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
*NL*
bed
.
The
collapse
had
come
,
as
on
former
occasion
,
just
as
I
had
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
leaving
the
room
,
last
of
our
party
,
he
said
to
me
in
a
*NL*
quiet
,
well-bred
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
,
I
trust
,
Dr.
Seward
,
do
me
the
justice
to
bear
in
mind
,
later
*NL*
on
,
that
I
did
what
I
could
to
convince
you
to-night

CHAPTER

*NL*
JONATHAN
HARKER
'S
JOURNAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
1
October
,
5
a.
m.
_
--
I
went
with
the
party
to
the
search
with
an
easy
*NL*
mind
,
for
I
think
I
never
saw
Mina
so
absolutely
strong
and
well
.
I
am
*NL*
so
glad
that
she
consented
to
hold
back
and
let
us
men
do
the
work
.
*NL*
Somehow
,
it
was
a
dread
to
me
that
she
was
in
this
fearful
business
at
*NL*
all
;
but
now
that
her
work
is
done
,
and
that
it
is
due
to
her
energy
and
*NL*
brains
and
foresight
that
the
whole
story
is
put
together
in
such
a
way
*NL*
that
every
point
tells
,
she
may
well
feel
that
her
part
is
finished
,
and
*NL*
that
she
can
henceforth
leave
the
rest
to
us
.
We
were
,
I
think
,
all
a
*NL*
little
upset
by
the
scene
with
Mr.
Renfield
.
When
we
came
away
from
his
*NL*
room
we
were
silent
till
we
got
back
to
the
study
.
Then
Mr.
Morris
said
*NL*
to
Dr.
Seward
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Jack
,
if
that
man
was
n't
attempting
a
bluff
,
he
is
about
the
*NL*
sanest
lunatic
I
ever
saw
.
I
'm
not
sure
,
but
I
believe
that
he
had
some
*NL*
serious
purpose
,
and
if
he
had
,
it
was
pretty
rough
on
him
not
to
get
a
*NL*
chance
.
''
Lord
Godalming
and
I
were
silent
,
but
Dr.
Van
Helsing
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
John
,
you
know
more
of
lunatics
than
I
do
,
and
I
'm
glad
of
it
,
*NL*
for
I
fear
that
if
it
had
been
to
me
to
decide
I
would
before
that
last
*NL*
hysterical
outburst
have
given
him
free
.
But
we
live
and
learn
,
and
in
*NL*
our
present
task
we
must
take
no
chance
,
as
my
friend
Quincey
would
say
.
*NL*
All
is
best
as
they
are
.
''
Dr.
Seward
seemed
to
answer
them
both
in
a
*NL*
dreamy
kind
of
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
but
that
I
agree
with
you
.
If
that
man
had
been
an
*NL*
ordinary
lunatic
I
would
have
taken
my
chance
of
trusting
him
;
but
he
*NL*
seems
so
mixed
up
with
the
Count
in
an
indexy
kind
of
way
that
I
am
*NL*
afraid
of
doing
anything
wrong
by
helping
his
fads
.
I
ca
n't
forget
how
*NL*
he
prayed
with
almost
equal
fervour
for
a
cat
,
and
then
tried
to
tear
my
*NL*
throat
out
with
his
teeth
.
Besides
,
he
called
the
Count
`
lord
and
*NL*
master
,
'
and
he
may
want
to
get
out
to
help
him
in
some
diabolical
way
.
*NL*
That
horrid
thing
has
the
wolves
and
the
rats
and
his
own
kind
to
help
*NL*
him
,
so
I
suppose
he
is
n't
above
trying
to
use
a
respectable
lunatic
.
He
*NL*
certainly
did
seem
earnest
,
though
.
I
only
hope
we
have
done
what
is
*NL*
best
.
These
things
,
in
conjunction
with
the
wild
work
we
have
in
hand
,
*NL*
help
to
unnerve
a
man
.
''
The
Professor
stepped
over
,
and
laying
his
hand
*NL*
on
his
shoulder
,
said
in
his
grave
,
kindly
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
John
,
have
no
fear
.
We
are
trying
to
do
our
duty
in
a
very
sad
*NL*
and
terrible
case
;
we
can
only
do
as
we
deem
best
.
What
else
have
we
to
*NL*
hope
for
,
except
the
pity
of
the
good
God
?
''
Lord
Godalming
had
slipped
*NL*
away
for
a
few
minutes
,
but
now
he
returned
.
He
held
up
a
little
silver
*NL*
whistle
,
as
he
remarked
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
old
place
may
be
full
of
rats
,
and
if
so
,
I
've
got
an
antidote
on
*NL*
call
.
''
Having
passed
the
wall
,
we
took
our
way
to
the
house
,
taking
care
*NL*
to
keep
in
the
shadows
of
the
trees
on
the
lawn
when
the
moonlight
shone
*NL*
out
.
When
we
got
to
the
porch
the
Professor
opened
his
bag
and
took
out
*NL*
a
lot
of
things
,
which
he
laid
on
the
step
,
sorting
them
into
four
*NL*
little
groups
,
evidently
one
for
each
.
Then
he
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friends
,
we
are
going
into
a
terrible
danger
,
and
we
need
arms
of
*NL*
many
kinds
.
Our
enemy
is
not
merely
spiritual
.
Remember
that
he
has
the
*NL*
strength
of
twenty
men
,
and
that
,
though
our
necks
or
our
windpipes
are
*NL*
of
the
common
kind
--
and
therefore
breakable
or
crushable
--
his
are
not
*NL*
amenable
to
mere
strength
.
A
stronger
man
,
or
a
body
of
men
more
strong
*NL*
in
all
than
him
,
can
at
certain
times
hold
him
;
but
they
can
not
hurt
him
*NL*
as
we
can
be
hurt
by
him
.
We
must
,
therefore
,
guard
ourselves
from
his
*NL*
touch
.
Keep
this
near
your
heart
''
--
as
he
spoke
he
lifted
a
little
silver
*NL*
crucifix
and
held
it
out
to
me
,
I
being
nearest
to
him
--
``
put
these
*NL*
flowers
round
your
neck
''
--
here
he
handed
to
me
a
wreath
of
withered
*NL*
garlic
blossoms
--
``
for
other
enemies
more
mundane
,
this
revolver
and
this
*NL*
knife
;
and
for
aid
in
all
,
these
so
small
electric
lamps
,
which
you
can
*NL*
fasten
to
your
breast
;
and
for
all
,
and
above
all
at
the
last
,
this
,
*NL*
which
we
must
not
desecrate
needless
.
''
This
was
a
portion
of
Sacred
*NL*
Wafer
,
which
he
put
in
an
envelope
and
handed
to
me
.
Each
of
the
others
*NL*
was
similarly
equipped
.
``
Now
,
''
he
said
,
``
friend
John
,
where
are
the
*NL*
skeleton
keys
?
If
so
that
we
can
open
the
door
,
we
need
not
break
house
*NL*
by
the
window
,
as
before
at
Miss
Lucy
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Seward
tried
one
or
two
skeleton
keys
,
his
mechanical
dexterity
as
a
*NL*
surgeon
standing
him
in
good
stead
.
Presently
he
got
one
to
suit
;
after
*NL*
a
little
play
back
and
forward
the
bolt
yielded
,
and
,
with
a
rusty
*NL*
clang
,
shot
back
.
We
pressed
on
the
door
,
the
rusty
hinges
creaked
,
and
*NL*
it
slowly
opened
.
It
was
startlingly
like
the
image
conveyed
to
me
in
*NL*
Dr.
Seward
's
diary
of
the
opening
of
Miss
Westenra
's
tomb
;
I
fancy
that
*NL*
the
same
idea
seemed
to
strike
the
others
,
for
with
one
accord
they
*NL*
shrank
back
.
The
Professor
was
the
first
to
move
forward
,
and
stepped
*NL*
into
the
open
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
In
manus
tuas
,
Domine
!
_
''
he
said
,
crossing
himself
as
he
passed
over
*NL*
the
threshold
.
We
closed
the
door
behind
us
,
lest
when
we
should
have
*NL*
lit
our
lamps
we
should
possibly
attract
attention
from
the
road
.
The
*NL*
Professor
carefully
tried
the
lock
,
lest
we
might
not
be
able
to
open
it
*NL*
from
within
should
we
be
in
a
hurry
making
our
exit
.
Then
we
all
lit
our
*NL*
lamps
and
proceeded
on
our
search
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
from
the
tiny
lamps
fell
in
all
sorts
of
odd
forms
,
as
the
*NL*
rays
crossed
each
other
,
or
the
opacity
of
our
bodies
threw
great
*NL*
shadows
.
I
could
not
for
my
life
get
away
from
the
feeling
that
there
*NL*
was
some
one
else
amongst
us
.
I
suppose
it
was
the
recollection
,
so
*NL*
powerfully
brought
home
to
me
by
the
grim
surroundings
,
of
that
terrible
*NL*
experience
in
Transylvania
.
I
think
the
feeling
was
common
to
us
all
,
*NL*
for
I
noticed
that
the
others
kept
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
every
*NL*
sound
and
every
new
shadow
,
just
as
I
felt
myself
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
place
was
thick
with
dust
.
The
floor
was
seemingly
inches
*NL*
deep
,
except
where
there
were
recent
footsteps
,
in
which
on
holding
down
*NL*
my
lamp
I
could
see
marks
of
hobnails
where
the
dust
was
cracked
.
The
*NL*
walls
were
fluffy
and
heavy
with
dust
,
and
in
the
corners
were
masses
of
*NL*
spider
's
webs
,
whereon
the
dust
had
gathered
till
they
looked
like
old
*NL*
tattered
rags
as
the
weight
had
torn
them
partly
down
.
On
a
table
in
the
*NL*
hall
was
a
great
bunch
of
keys
,
with
a
time-yellowed
label
on
each
.
They
*NL*
had
been
used
several
times
,
for
on
the
table
were
several
similar
rents
*NL*
in
the
blanket
of
dust
,
similar
to
that
exposed
when
the
Professor
*NL*
lifted
them
.
He
turned
to
me
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
this
place
,
Jonathan
.
You
have
copied
maps
of
it
,
and
you
know
*NL*
it
at
least
more
than
we
do
.
Which
is
the
way
to
the
chapel
?
''
I
had
an
*NL*
idea
of
its
direction
,
though
on
my
former
visit
I
had
not
been
able
to
*NL*
get
admission
to
it
;
so
I
led
the
way
,
and
after
a
few
wrong
turnings
*NL*
found
myself
opposite
a
low
,
arched
oaken
door
,
ribbed
with
iron
bands
.
*NL*
``
This
is
the
spot
,
''
said
the
Professor
as
he
turned
his
lamp
on
a
small
*NL*
map
of
the
house
,
copied
from
the
file
of
my
original
correspondence
*NL*
regarding
the
purchase
.
With
a
little
trouble
we
found
the
key
on
the
*NL*
bunch
and
opened
the
door
.
We
were
prepared
for
some
unpleasantness
,
for
*NL*
as
we
were
opening
the
door
a
faint
,
malodorous
air
seemed
to
exhale
*NL*
through
the
gaps
,
but
none
of
us
ever
expected
such
an
odour
as
we
*NL*
encountered
.
None
of
the
others
had
met
the
Count
at
all
at
close
*NL*
quarters
,
and
when
I
had
seen
him
he
was
either
in
the
fasting
stage
of
*NL*
his
existence
in
his
rooms
or
,
when
he
was
gloated
with
fresh
blood
,
in
*NL*
a
ruined
building
open
to
the
air
;
but
here
the
place
was
small
and
*NL*
close
,
and
the
long
disuse
had
made
the
air
stagnant
and
foul
.
There
was
*NL*
an
earthy
smell
,
as
of
some
dry
miasma
,
which
came
through
the
fouler
*NL*
air
.
But
as
to
the
odour
itself
,
how
shall
I
describe
it
?
It
was
not
*NL*
alone
that
it
was
composed
of
all
the
ills
of
mortality
and
with
the
*NL*
pungent
,
acrid
smell
of
blood
,
but
it
seemed
as
though
corruption
had
*NL*
become
itself
corrupt
.
Faugh
!
it
sickens
me
to
think
of
it
.
Every
breath
*NL*
exhaled
by
that
monster
seemed
to
have
clung
to
the
place
and
*NL*
intensified
its
loathsomeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
ordinary
circumstances
such
a
stench
would
have
brought
our
*NL*
enterprise
to
an
end
;
but
this
was
no
ordinary
case
,
and
the
high
and
*NL*
terrible
purpose
in
which
we
were
involved
gave
us
a
strength
which
rose
*NL*
above
merely
physical
considerations
.
After
the
involuntary
shrinking
*NL*
consequent
on
the
first
nauseous
whiff
,
we
one
and
all
set
about
our
*NL*
work
as
though
that
loathsome
place
were
a
garden
of
roses
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
an
accurate
examination
of
the
place
,
the
Professor
saying
as
we
*NL*
began
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
thing
is
to
see
how
many
of
the
boxes
are
left
;
we
must
then
*NL*
examine
every
hole
and
corner
and
cranny
and
see
if
we
can
not
get
some
*NL*
clue
as
to
what
has
become
of
the
rest
.
''
A
glance
was
sufficient
to
show
*NL*
how
many
remained
,
for
the
great
earth
chests
were
bulky
,
and
there
was
*NL*
no
mistaking
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
only
twenty-nine
left
out
of
the
fifty
!
Once
I
got
a
fright
,
*NL*
for
,
seeing
Lord
Godalming
suddenly
turn
and
look
out
of
the
vaulted
*NL*
door
into
the
dark
passage
beyond
,
I
looked
too
,
and
for
an
instant
my
*NL*
heart
stood
still
.
Somewhere
,
looking
out
from
the
shadow
,
I
seemed
to
*NL*
see
the
high
lights
of
the
Count
's
evil
face
,
the
ridge
of
the
nose
,
the
*NL*
red
eyes
,
the
red
lips
,
the
awful
pallor
.
It
was
only
for
a
moment
,
for
,
*NL*
as
Lord
Godalming
said
,
``
I
thought
I
saw
a
face
,
but
it
was
only
the
*NL*
shadows
,
''
and
resumed
his
inquiry
,
I
turned
my
lamp
in
the
direction
,
*NL*
and
stepped
into
the
passage
.
There
was
no
sign
of
any
one
;
and
as
there
*NL*
were
no
corners
,
no
doors
,
no
aperture
of
any
kind
,
but
only
the
solid
*NL*
walls
of
the
passage
,
there
could
be
no
hiding-place
even
for
_
him
_
.
I
*NL*
took
it
that
fear
had
helped
imagination
,
and
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
I
saw
Morris
step
suddenly
back
from
a
corner
,
which
*NL*
he
was
examining
.
We
all
followed
his
movements
with
our
eyes
,
for
*NL*
undoubtedly
some
nervousness
was
growing
on
us
,
and
we
saw
a
whole
mass
*NL*
of
phosphorescence
,
which
twinkled
like
stars
.
We
all
instinctively
drew
*NL*
back
.
The
whole
place
was
becoming
alive
with
rats
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
or
two
we
stood
appalled
,
all
save
Lord
Godalming
,
who
was
*NL*
seemingly
prepared
for
such
an
emergency
.
Rushing
over
to
the
great
*NL*
iron-bound
oaken
door
,
which
Dr.
Seward
had
described
from
the
outside
,
*NL*
and
which
I
had
seen
myself
,
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
,
drew
the
*NL*
huge
bolts
,
and
swung
the
door
open
.
Then
,
taking
his
little
silver
*NL*
whistle
from
his
pocket
,
he
blew
a
low
,
shrill
call
.
It
was
answered
*NL*
from
behind
Dr.
Seward
's
house
by
the
yelping
of
dogs
,
and
after
about
a
*NL*
minute
three
terriers
came
dashing
round
the
corner
of
the
house
.
*NL*
Unconsciously
we
had
all
moved
towards
the
door
,
and
as
we
moved
I
*NL*
noticed
that
the
dust
had
been
much
disturbed
:
the
boxes
which
had
been
*NL*
taken
out
had
been
brought
this
way
.
But
even
in
the
minute
that
had
*NL*
elapsed
the
number
of
the
rats
had
vastly
increased
.
They
seemed
to
*NL*
swarm
over
the
place
all
at
once
,
till
the
lamplight
,
shining
on
their
*NL*
moving
dark
bodies
and
glittering
,
baleful
eyes
,
made
the
place
look
*NL*
like
a
bank
of
earth
set
with
fireflies
.
The
dogs
dashed
on
,
but
at
the
*NL*
threshold
suddenly
stopped
and
snarled
,
and
then
,
simultaneously
lifting
*NL*
their
noses
,
began
to
howl
in
most
lugubrious
fashion
.
The
rats
were
*NL*
multiplying
in
thousands
,
and
we
moved
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Godalming
lifted
one
of
the
dogs
,
and
carrying
him
in
,
placed
him
*NL*
on
the
floor
.
The
instant
his
feet
touched
the
ground
he
seemed
to
*NL*
recover
his
courage
,
and
rushed
at
his
natural
enemies
.
They
fled
before
*NL*
him
so
fast
that
before
he
had
shaken
the
life
out
of
a
score
,
the
other
*NL*
dogs
,
who
had
by
now
been
lifted
in
the
same
manner
,
had
but
small
prey
*NL*
ere
the
whole
mass
had
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
their
going
it
seemed
as
if
some
evil
presence
had
departed
,
for
*NL*
the
dogs
frisked
about
and
barked
merrily
as
they
made
sudden
darts
at
*NL*
their
prostrate
foes
,
and
turned
them
over
and
over
and
tossed
them
in
*NL*
the
air
with
vicious
shakes
.
We
all
seemed
to
find
our
spirits
rise
.
*NL*
Whether
it
was
the
purifying
of
the
deadly
atmosphere
by
the
opening
of
*NL*
the
chapel
door
,
or
the
relief
which
we
experienced
by
finding
ourselves
*NL*
in
the
open
I
know
not
;
but
most
certainly
the
shadow
of
dread
seemed
to
*NL*
slip
from
us
like
a
robe
,
and
the
occasion
of
our
coming
lost
something
*NL*
of
its
grim
significance
,
though
we
did
not
slacken
a
whit
in
our
*NL*
resolution
.
We
closed
the
outer
door
and
barred
and
locked
it
,
and
*NL*
bringing
the
dogs
with
us
,
began
our
search
of
the
house
.
We
found
*NL*
nothing
throughout
except
dust
in
extraordinary
proportions
,
and
all
*NL*
untouched
save
for
my
own
footsteps
when
I
had
made
my
first
visit
.
*NL*
Never
once
did
the
dogs
exhibit
any
symptom
of
uneasiness
,
and
even
when
*NL*
we
returned
to
the
chapel
they
frisked
about
as
though
they
had
been
*NL*
rabbit-hunting
in
a
summer
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
was
quickening
in
the
east
when
we
emerged
from
the
front
.
*NL*
Dr.
Van
Helsing
had
taken
the
key
of
the
hall-door
from
the
bunch
,
and
*NL*
locked
the
door
in
orthodox
fashion
,
putting
the
key
into
his
pocket
*NL*
when
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
,
''
he
said
,
``
our
night
has
been
eminently
successful
.
No
harm
has
*NL*
come
to
us
such
as
I
feared
might
be
and
yet
we
have
ascertained
how
*NL*
many
boxes
are
missing
.
More
than
all
do
I
rejoice
that
this
,
our
*NL*
first
--
and
perhaps
our
most
difficult
and
dangerous
--
step
has
been
*NL*
accomplished
without
the
bringing
thereinto
our
most
sweet
Madam
Mina
or
*NL*
troubling
her
waking
or
sleeping
thoughts
with
sights
and
sounds
and
*NL*
smells
of
horror
which
she
might
never
forget
.
One
lesson
,
too
,
we
have
*NL*
learned
,
if
it
be
allowable
to
argue
_
a
particulari
_
:
that
the
brute
*NL*
beasts
which
are
to
the
Count
's
command
are
yet
themselves
not
amenable
*NL*
to
his
spiritual
power
;
for
look
,
these
rats
that
would
come
to
his
*NL*
call
,
just
as
from
his
castle
top
he
summon
the
wolves
to
your
going
and
*NL*
to
that
poor
mother
's
cry
,
though
they
come
to
him
,
they
run
pell-mell
*NL*
from
the
so
little
dogs
of
my
friend
Arthur
.
We
have
other
matters
*NL*
before
us
,
other
dangers
,
other
fears
;
and
that
monster
--
he
has
not
used
*NL*
his
power
over
the
brute
world
for
the
only
or
the
last
time
to-night
.
*NL*
So
be
it
that
he
has
gone
elsewhere
.
Good
!
It
has
given
us
opportunity
*NL*
to
cry
`
check
'
in
some
ways
in
this
chess
game
,
which
we
play
for
the
*NL*
stake
of
human
souls
.
And
now
let
us
go
home
.
The
dawn
is
close
at
hand
,
*NL*
and
we
have
reason
to
be
content
with
our
first
night
's
work
.
It
may
be
*NL*
ordained
that
we
have
many
nights
and
days
to
follow
,
if
full
of
peril
;
*NL*
but
we
must
go
on
,
and
from
no
danger
shall
we
shrink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
silent
when
we
got
back
,
save
for
some
poor
creature
who
*NL*
was
screaming
away
in
one
of
the
distant
wards
,
and
a
low
,
moaning
sound
*NL*
from
Renfield
's
room
.
The
poor
wretch
was
doubtless
torturing
himself
,
*NL*
after
the
manner
of
the
insane
,
with
needless
thoughts
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
tiptoe
into
our
own
room
,
and
found
Mina
asleep
,
breathing
so
*NL*
softly
that
I
had
to
put
my
ear
down
to
hear
it
.
She
looks
paler
than
*NL*
usual
.
I
hope
the
meeting
to-night
has
not
upset
her
.
I
am
truly
*NL*
thankful
that
she
is
to
be
left
out
of
our
future
work
,
and
even
of
our
*NL*
deliberations
.
It
is
too
great
a
strain
for
a
woman
to
bear
.
I
did
not
*NL*
think
so
at
first
,
but
I
know
better
now
.
Therefore
I
am
glad
that
it
is
*NL*
settled
.
There
may
be
things
which
would
frighten
her
to
hear
;
and
yet
*NL*
to
conceal
them
from
her
might
be
worse
than
to
tell
her
if
once
she
*NL*
suspected
that
there
was
any
concealment
.
Henceforth
our
work
is
to
be
a
*NL*
sealed
book
to
her
,
till
at
least
such
time
as
we
can
tell
her
that
all
*NL*
is
finished
,
and
the
earth
free
from
a
monster
of
the
nether
world
.
I
*NL*
daresay
it
will
be
difficult
to
begin
to
keep
silence
after
such
*NL*
confidence
as
ours
;
but
I
must
be
resolute
,
and
to-morrow
I
shall
keep
*NL*
dark
over
to-night
's
doings
,
and
shall
refuse
to
speak
of
anything
that
*NL*
has
happened
.
I
rest
on
the
sofa
,
so
as
not
to
disturb
her
.

_
1
October
,
later
.
_
--
I
suppose
it
was
natural
that
we
should
have
all
*NL*
overslept
ourselves
,
for
the
day
was
a
busy
one
,
and
the
night
had
no
*NL*
rest
at
all
.
Even
Mina
must
have
felt
its
exhaustion
,
for
though
I
slept
*NL*
till
the
sun
was
high
,
I
was
awake
before
her
,
and
had
to
call
two
or
*NL*
three
times
before
she
awoke
.
Indeed
,
she
was
so
sound
asleep
that
for
a
*NL*
few
seconds
she
did
not
recognize
me
,
but
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
blank
terror
,
as
one
looks
who
has
been
waked
out
of
a
bad
dream
.
She
*NL*
complained
a
little
of
being
tired
,
and
I
let
her
rest
till
later
in
the
*NL*
day
.
We
now
know
of
twenty-one
boxes
having
been
removed
,
and
if
it
be
*NL*
that
several
were
taken
in
any
of
these
removals
we
may
be
able
to
trace
*NL*
them
all
.
Such
will
,
of
course
,
immensely
simplify
our
labour
,
and
the
*NL*
sooner
the
matter
is
attended
to
the
better
.
I
shall
look
up

--
It
was
towards
noon
when
I
was
awakened
by
the
Professor
*NL*
walking
into
my
room
.
He
was
more
jolly
and
cheerful
than
usual
,
and
it
*NL*
is
quite
evident
that
last
night
's
work
has
helped
to
take
some
of
the
*NL*
brooding
weight
off
his
mind
.
After
going
over
the
adventure
of
the
*NL*
night
he
suddenly
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
patient
interests
me
much
.
May
it
be
that
with
you
I
visit
him
*NL*
this
morning
?
Or
if
that
you
are
too
occupy
,
I
can
go
alone
if
it
may
*NL*
be
.
It
is
a
new
experience
to
me
to
find
a
lunatic
who
talk
philosophy
,
*NL*
and
reason
so
sound
.
''
I
had
some
work
to
do
which
pressed
,
so
I
told
him
*NL*
that
if
he
would
go
alone
I
would
be
glad
,
as
then
I
should
not
have
to
*NL*
keep
him
waiting
;
so
I
called
an
attendant
and
gave
him
the
necessary
*NL*
instructions
.
Before
the
Professor
left
the
room
I
cautioned
him
against
*NL*
getting
any
false
impression
from
my
patient
.
``
But
,
''
he
answered
,
``
I
*NL*
want
him
to
talk
of
himself
and
of
his
delusion
as
to
consuming
live
*NL*
things
.
He
said
to
Madam
Mina
,
as
I
see
in
your
diary
of
yesterday
,
that
*NL*
he
had
once
had
such
a
belief
.
Why
do
you
smile
,
friend
John
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
I
said
,
``
but
the
answer
is
here
.
''
I
laid
my
hand
on
the
*NL*
type-written
matter
.
``
When
our
sane
and
learned
lunatic
made
that
very
*NL*
statement
of
how
he
_
used
_
to
consume
life
,
his
mouth
was
actually
*NL*
nauseous
with
the
flies
and
spiders
which
he
had
eaten
just
before
Mrs.
*NL*
Harker
entered
the
room
.
''
Van
Helsing
smiled
in
turn
.
``
Good
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Your
memory
is
true
,
friend
John
.
I
should
have
remembered
.
And
yet
it
*NL*
is
this
very
obliquity
of
thought
and
memory
which
makes
mental
disease
*NL*
such
a
fascinating
study
.
Perhaps
I
may
gain
more
knowledge
out
of
the
*NL*
folly
of
this
madman
than
I
shall
from
the
teaching
of
the
most
wise
.
*NL*
Who
knows
?
''
I
went
on
with
my
work
,
and
before
long
was
through
that
in
*NL*
hand
.
It
seemed
that
the
time
had
been
very
short
indeed
,
but
there
was
*NL*
Van
Helsing
back
in
the
study
.
``
Do
I
interrupt
?
''
he
asked
politely
as
he
*NL*
stood
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
I
answered
.
``
Come
in
.
My
work
is
finished
,
and
I
am
free
.
*NL*
I
can
go
with
you
now
,
if
you
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
needless
;
I
have
seen
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
that
he
does
not
appraise
me
at
much
.
Our
interview
was
short
.
*NL*
When
I
entered
his
room
he
was
sitting
on
a
stool
in
the
centre
,
with
*NL*
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
his
face
was
the
picture
of
sullen
*NL*
discontent
.
I
spoke
to
him
as
cheerfully
as
I
could
,
and
with
such
a
*NL*
measure
of
respect
as
I
could
assume
.
He
made
no
reply
whatever
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
you
know
me
?
''
I
asked
.
His
answer
was
not
reassuring
:
``
I
know
you
well
*NL*
enough
;
you
are
the
old
fool
Van
Helsing
.
I
wish
you
would
take
yourself
*NL*
and
your
idiotic
brain
theories
somewhere
else
.
Damn
all
thick-headed
*NL*
Dutchmen
!
''
Not
a
word
more
would
he
say
,
but
sat
in
his
implacable
*NL*
sullenness
as
indifferent
to
me
as
though
I
had
not
been
in
the
room
at
*NL*
all
.
Thus
departed
for
this
time
my
chance
of
much
learning
from
this
so
*NL*
clever
lunatic
;
so
I
shall
go
,
if
I
may
,
and
cheer
myself
with
a
few
*NL*
happy
words
with
that
sweet
soul
Madam
Mina
.
Friend
John
,
it
does
*NL*
rejoice
me
unspeakable
that
she
is
no
more
to
be
pained
,
no
more
to
be
*NL*
worried
with
our
terrible
things
.
Though
we
shall
much
miss
her
help
,
it
*NL*
is
better
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
with
you
with
all
my
heart
,
''
I
answered
earnestly
,
for
I
did
*NL*
not
want
him
to
weaken
in
this
matter
.
``
Mrs.
Harker
is
better
out
of
it
.
*NL*
Things
are
quite
bad
enough
for
us
,
all
men
of
the
world
,
and
who
have
*NL*
been
in
many
tight
places
in
our
time
;
but
it
is
no
place
for
a
woman
,
*NL*
and
if
she
had
remained
in
touch
with
the
affair
,
it
would
in
time
*NL*
infallibly
have
wrecked
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Van
Helsing
has
gone
to
confer
with
Mrs.
Harker
and
Harker
;
Quincey
*NL*
and
Art
are
all
out
following
up
the
clues
as
to
the
earth-boxes
.
I
*NL*
shall
finish
my
round
of
work
and
we
shall
meet
to-night

--
It
is
strange
to
me
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
as
I
am
to-day
;
*NL*
after
Jonathan
's
full
confidence
for
so
many
years
,
to
see
him
*NL*
manifestly
avoid
certain
matters
,
and
those
the
most
vital
of
all
.
This
*NL*
morning
I
slept
late
after
the
fatigues
of
yesterday
,
and
though
*NL*
Jonathan
was
late
too
,
he
was
the
earlier
.
He
spoke
to
me
before
he
went
*NL*
out
,
never
more
sweetly
or
tenderly
,
but
he
never
mentioned
a
word
of
*NL*
what
had
happened
in
the
visit
to
the
Count
's
house
.
And
yet
he
must
*NL*
have
known
how
terribly
anxious
I
was
.
Poor
dear
fellow
!
I
suppose
it
*NL*
must
have
distressed
him
even
more
than
it
did
me
.
They
all
agreed
that
*NL*
it
was
best
that
I
should
not
be
drawn
further
into
this
awful
work
,
and
*NL*
I
acquiesced
.
But
to
think
that
he
keeps
anything
from
me
!
And
now
I
am
*NL*
crying
like
a
silly
fool
,
when
I
_
know
_
it
comes
from
my
husband
's
great
*NL*
love
and
from
the
good
,
good
wishes
of
those
other
strong
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
has
done
me
good
.
Well
,
some
day
Jonathan
will
tell
me
all
;
and
*NL*
lest
it
should
ever
be
that
he
should
think
for
a
moment
that
I
kept
*NL*
anything
from
him
,
I
still
keep
my
journal
as
usual
.
Then
if
he
has
*NL*
feared
of
my
trust
I
shall
show
it
to
him
,
with
every
thought
of
my
*NL*
heart
put
down
for
his
dear
eyes
to
read
.
I
feel
strangely
sad
and
*NL*
low-spirited
to-day
.
I
suppose
it
is
the
reaction
from
the
terrible
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Last
night
I
went
to
bed
when
the
men
had
gone
,
simply
because
they
told
*NL*
me
to
.
I
did
n't
feel
sleepy
,
and
I
did
feel
full
of
devouring
anxiety
.
I
*NL*
kept
thinking
over
everything
that
has
been
ever
since
Jonathan
came
to
*NL*
see
me
in
London
,
and
it
all
seems
like
a
horrible
tragedy
,
with
fate
*NL*
pressing
on
relentlessly
to
some
destined
end
.
Everything
that
one
does
*NL*
seems
,
no
matter
how
right
it
may
be
,
to
bring
on
the
very
thing
which
*NL*
is
most
to
be
deplored
.
If
I
had
n't
gone
to
Whitby
,
perhaps
poor
dear
*NL*
Lucy
would
be
with
us
now
.
She
had
n't
taken
to
visiting
the
churchyard
*NL*
till
I
came
,
and
if
she
had
n't
come
there
in
the
day-time
with
me
she
*NL*
would
n't
have
walked
there
in
her
sleep
;
and
if
she
had
n't
gone
there
at
*NL*
night
and
asleep
,
that
monster
could
n't
have
destroyed
her
as
he
did
.
*NL*
Oh
,
why
did
I
ever
go
to
Whitby
?
There
now
,
crying
again
!
I
wonder
what
*NL*
has
come
over
me
to-day
.
I
must
hide
it
from
Jonathan
,
for
if
he
knew
*NL*
that
I
had
been
crying
twice
in
one
morning
--
I
,
who
never
cried
on
my
*NL*
own
account
,
and
whom
he
has
never
caused
to
shed
a
tear
--
the
dear
*NL*
fellow
would
fret
his
heart
out
.
I
shall
put
a
bold
face
on
,
and
if
I
do
*NL*
feel
weepy
,
he
shall
never
see
it
.
I
suppose
it
is
one
of
the
lessons
*NL*
that
we
poor
women
have
to
learn
...
*NL*
*NL*
I
ca
n't
quite
remember
how
I
fell
asleep
last
night
.
I
remember
hearing
*NL*
the
sudden
barking
of
the
dogs
and
a
lot
of
queer
sounds
,
like
praying
*NL*
on
a
very
tumultuous
scale
,
from
Mr.
Renfield
's
room
,
which
is
somewhere
*NL*
under
this
.
And
then
there
was
silence
over
everything
,
silence
so
*NL*
profound
that
it
startled
me
,
and
I
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
All
was
dark
and
silent
,
the
black
shadows
thrown
by
the
moonlight
*NL*
seeming
full
of
a
silent
mystery
of
their
own
.
Not
a
thing
seemed
to
be
*NL*
stirring
,
but
all
to
be
grim
and
fixed
as
death
or
fate
;
so
that
a
thin
*NL*
streak
of
white
mist
,
that
crept
with
almost
imperceptible
slowness
*NL*
across
the
grass
towards
the
house
,
seemed
to
have
a
sentience
and
a
*NL*
vitality
of
its
own
.
I
think
that
the
digression
of
my
thoughts
must
*NL*
have
done
me
good
,
for
when
I
got
back
to
bed
I
found
a
lethargy
*NL*
creeping
over
me
.
I
lay
a
while
,
but
could
not
quite
sleep
,
so
I
got
out
*NL*
and
looked
out
of
the
window
again
.
The
mist
was
spreading
,
and
was
now
*NL*
close
up
to
the
house
,
so
that
I
could
see
it
lying
thick
against
the
*NL*
wall
,
as
though
it
were
stealing
up
to
the
windows
.
The
poor
man
was
*NL*
more
loud
than
ever
,
and
though
I
could
not
distinguish
a
word
he
said
,
*NL*
I
could
in
some
way
recognise
in
his
tones
some
passionate
entreaty
on
*NL*
his
part
.
Then
there
was
the
sound
of
a
struggle
,
and
I
knew
that
the
*NL*
attendants
were
dealing
with
him
.
I
was
so
frightened
that
I
crept
into
*NL*
bed
,
and
pulled
the
clothes
over
my
head
,
putting
my
fingers
in
my
ears
.
*NL*
I
was
not
then
a
bit
sleepy
,
at
least
so
I
thought
;
but
I
must
have
*NL*
fallen
asleep
,
for
,
except
dreams
,
I
do
not
remember
anything
until
the
*NL*
morning
,
when
Jonathan
woke
me
.
I
think
that
it
took
me
an
effort
and
a
*NL*
little
time
to
realise
where
I
was
,
and
that
it
was
Jonathan
who
was
*NL*
bending
over
me
.
My
dream
was
very
peculiar
,
and
was
almost
typical
of
*NL*
the
way
that
waking
thoughts
become
merged
in
,
or
continued
in
,
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
that
I
was
asleep
,
and
waiting
for
Jonathan
to
come
back
.
I
*NL*
was
very
anxious
about
him
,
and
I
was
powerless
to
act
;
my
feet
,
and
my
*NL*
hands
,
and
my
brain
were
weighted
,
so
that
nothing
could
proceed
at
the
*NL*
usual
pace
.
And
so
I
slept
uneasily
and
thought
.
Then
it
began
to
dawn
*NL*
upon
me
that
the
air
was
heavy
,
and
dank
,
and
cold
.
I
put
back
the
*NL*
clothes
from
my
face
,
and
found
,
to
my
surprise
,
that
all
was
dim
*NL*
around
.
The
gaslight
which
I
had
left
lit
for
Jonathan
,
but
turned
down
,
*NL*
came
only
like
a
tiny
red
spark
through
the
fog
,
which
had
evidently
*NL*
grown
thicker
and
poured
into
the
room
.
Then
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
*NL*
had
shut
the
window
before
I
had
come
to
bed
.
I
would
have
got
out
to
*NL*
make
certain
on
the
point
,
but
some
leaden
lethargy
seemed
to
chain
my
*NL*
limbs
and
even
my
will
.
I
lay
still
and
endured
;
that
was
all
.
I
closed
*NL*
my
eyes
,
but
could
still
see
through
my
eyelids
.
-LRB-
It
is
wonderful
what
*NL*
tricks
our
dreams
play
us
,
and
how
conveniently
we
can
imagine
.
-RRB-
The
*NL*
mist
grew
thicker
and
thicker
and
I
could
see
now
how
it
came
in
,
for
I
*NL*
could
see
it
like
smoke
--
or
with
the
white
energy
of
boiling
*NL*
water
--
pouring
in
,
not
through
the
window
,
but
through
the
joinings
of
*NL*
the
door
.
It
got
thicker
and
thicker
,
till
it
seemed
as
if
it
became
*NL*
concentrated
into
a
sort
of
pillar
of
cloud
in
the
room
,
through
the
top
*NL*
of
which
I
could
see
the
light
of
the
gas
shining
like
a
red
eye
.
Things
*NL*
began
to
whirl
through
my
brain
just
as
the
cloudy
column
was
now
*NL*
whirling
in
the
room
,
and
through
it
all
came
the
scriptural
words
``
a
*NL*
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
and
of
fire
by
night
.
''
Was
it
indeed
some
such
*NL*
spiritual
guidance
that
was
coming
to
me
in
my
sleep
?
But
the
pillar
was
*NL*
composed
of
both
the
day
and
the
night-guiding
,
for
the
fire
was
in
the
*NL*
red
eye
,
which
at
the
thought
got
a
new
fascination
for
me
;
till
,
as
I
*NL*
looked
,
the
fire
divided
,
and
seemed
to
shine
on
me
through
the
fog
like
*NL*
two
red
eyes
,
such
as
Lucy
told
me
of
in
her
momentary
mental
wandering
*NL*
when
,
on
the
cliff
,
the
dying
sunlight
struck
the
windows
of
St.
Mary
's
*NL*
Church
.
Suddenly
the
horror
burst
upon
me
that
it
was
thus
that
Jonathan
*NL*
had
seen
those
awful
women
growing
into
reality
through
the
whirling
mist
*NL*
in
the
moonlight
,
and
in
my
dream
I
must
have
fainted
,
for
all
became
*NL*
black
darkness
.
The
last
conscious
effort
which
imagination
made
was
to
*NL*
show
me
a
livid
white
face
bending
over
me
out
of
the
mist
.
I
must
be
*NL*
careful
of
such
dreams
,
for
they
would
unseat
one
's
reason
if
there
were
*NL*
too
much
of
them
.
I
would
get
Dr.
Van
Helsing
or
Dr.
Seward
to
prescribe
*NL*
something
for
me
which
would
make
me
sleep
,
only
that
I
fear
to
alarm
*NL*
them
.
Such
a
dream
at
the
present
time
would
become
woven
into
their
*NL*
fears
for
me
.
To-night
I
shall
strive
hard
to
sleep
naturally
.
If
I
do
*NL*
not
,
I
shall
to-morrow
night
get
them
to
give
me
a
dose
of
chloral
;
that
*NL*
can
not
hurt
me
for
once
,
and
it
will
give
me
a
good
night
's
sleep
.
Last
*NL*
night
tired
me
more
than
if
I
had
not
slept
at
all
.

Last
night
I
slept
,
but
did
not
dream
.
I
must
have
*NL*
slept
soundly
,
for
I
was
not
waked
by
Jonathan
coming
to
bed
;
but
the
*NL*
sleep
has
not
refreshed
me
,
for
to-day
I
feel
terribly
weak
and
*NL*
spiritless
.
I
spent
all
yesterday
trying
to
read
,
or
lying
down
dozing
.
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
Mr.
Renfield
asked
if
he
might
see
me
.
Poor
man
,
he
was
*NL*
very
gentle
,
and
when
I
came
away
he
kissed
my
hand
and
bade
God
bless
*NL*
me
.
Some
way
it
affected
me
much
;
I
am
crying
when
I
think
of
him
.
This
*NL*
is
a
new
weakness
,
of
which
I
must
be
careful
.
Jonathan
would
be
*NL*
miserable
if
he
knew
I
had
been
crying
.
He
and
the
others
were
out
till
*NL*
dinner-time
,
and
they
all
came
in
tired
.
I
did
what
I
could
to
brighten
*NL*
them
up
,
and
I
suppose
that
the
effort
did
me
good
,
for
I
forgot
how
*NL*
tired
I
was
.
After
dinner
they
sent
me
to
bed
,
and
all
went
off
to
smoke
*NL*
together
,
as
they
said
,
but
I
knew
that
they
wanted
to
tell
each
other
*NL*
of
what
had
occurred
to
each
during
the
day
;
I
could
see
from
Jonathan
's
*NL*
manner
that
he
had
something
important
to
communicate
.
I
was
not
so
*NL*
sleepy
as
I
should
have
been
;
so
before
they
went
I
asked
Dr.
Seward
to
*NL*
give
me
a
little
opiate
of
some
kind
,
as
I
had
not
slept
well
the
night
*NL*
before
.
He
very
kindly
made
me
up
a
sleeping
draught
,
which
he
gave
to
*NL*
me
,
telling
me
that
it
would
do
me
no
harm
,
as
it
was
very
mild
...
I
*NL*
have
taken
it
,
and
am
waiting
for
sleep
,
which
still
keeps
aloof
.
I
hope
*NL*
I
have
not
done
wrong
,
for
as
sleep
begins
to
flirt
with
me
,
a
new
fear
*NL*
comes
:
that
I
may
have
been
foolish
in
thus
depriving
myself
of
the
*NL*
power
of
waking
.
I
might
want
it
.
Here
comes
sleep
.
Good-night
.

JONATHAN
HARKER
'S
JOURNAL

*NL*
_
1
October
,
evening
.
_
--
I
found
Thomas
Snelling
in
his
house
at
Bethnal
*NL*
Green
,
but
unhappily
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
remember
anything
.
The
*NL*
very
prospect
of
beer
which
my
expected
coming
had
opened
to
him
had
*NL*
proved
too
much
,
and
he
had
begun
too
early
on
his
expected
debauch
.
I
*NL*
learned
,
however
,
from
his
wife
,
who
seemed
a
decent
,
poor
soul
,
that
he
*NL*
was
only
the
assistant
to
Smollet
,
who
of
the
two
mates
was
the
*NL*
responsible
person
.
So
off
I
drove
to
Walworth
,
and
found
Mr.
Joseph
*NL*
Smollet
at
home
and
in
his
shirtsleeves
,
taking
a
late
tea
out
of
a
*NL*
saucer
.
He
is
a
decent
,
intelligent
fellow
,
distinctly
a
good
,
reliable
*NL*
type
of
workman
,
and
with
a
headpiece
of
his
own
.
He
remembered
all
*NL*
about
the
incident
of
the
boxes
,
and
from
a
wonderful
dog
's
-
eared
*NL*
notebook
,
which
he
produced
from
some
mysterious
receptacle
about
the
*NL*
seat
of
his
trousers
,
and
which
had
hieroglyphical
entries
in
thick
,
*NL*
half-obliterated
pencil
,
he
gave
me
the
destinations
of
the
boxes
.
There
*NL*
were
,
he
said
,
six
in
the
cartload
which
he
took
from
Carfax
and
left
at
*NL*
197
,
Chicksand
Street
,
Mile
End
New
Town
,
and
another
six
which
he
*NL*
deposited
at
Jamaica
Lane
,
Bermondsey
.
If
then
the
Count
meant
to
*NL*
scatter
these
ghastly
refuges
of
his
over
London
,
these
places
were
*NL*
chosen
as
the
first
of
delivery
,
so
that
later
he
might
distribute
more
*NL*
fully
.
The
systematic
manner
in
which
this
was
done
made
me
think
that
*NL*
he
could
not
mean
to
confine
himself
to
two
sides
of
London
.
He
was
now
*NL*
fixed
on
the
far
east
of
the
northern
shore
,
on
the
east
of
the
southern
*NL*
shore
,
and
on
the
south
.
The
north
and
west
were
surely
never
meant
to
*NL*
be
left
out
of
his
diabolical
scheme
--
let
alone
the
City
itself
and
the
*NL*
very
heart
of
fashionable
London
in
the
south-west
and
west
.
I
went
back
*NL*
to
Smollet
,
and
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
us
if
any
other
boxes
had
*NL*
been
taken
from
Carfax
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
guv
`
nor
,
you
've
treated
me
wery
`
an
`
some
''
--
I
had
given
him
half
a
*NL*
sovereign
--
``
an
'
I
'll
tell
yer
all
I
know
.
I
heard
a
man
by
the
name
of
*NL*
Bloxam
say
four
nights
ago
in
the
`
Are
an
'
`
Ounds
,
in
Pincher
's
Alley
,
*NL*
as
`
ow
he
an
'
his
mate
`
ad
`
ad
a
rare
dusty
job
in
a
old
`
ouse
at
*NL*
Purfect
.
There
ai
n't
a-many
such
jobs
as
this
`
ere
,
an
'
I
'm
thinkin
'
*NL*
that
maybe
Sam
Bloxam
could
tell
ye
summut
.
''
I
asked
if
he
could
tell
me
*NL*
where
to
find
him
.
I
told
him
that
if
he
could
get
me
the
address
it
*NL*
would
be
worth
another
half-sovereign
to
him
.
So
he
gulped
down
the
rest
*NL*
of
his
tea
and
stood
up
,
saying
that
he
was
going
to
begin
the
search
*NL*
then
and
there
.
At
the
door
he
stopped
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
`
ere
,
guv
`
nor
,
there
ai
n't
no
sense
in
me
a-keepin
'
you
`
ere
.
I
*NL*
may
find
Sam
soon
,
or
I
may
n't
;
but
anyhow
he
ai
n't
like
to
be
in
a
way
*NL*
to
tell
ye
much
to-night
.
Sam
is
a
rare
one
when
he
starts
on
the
booze
.
*NL*
If
you
can
give
me
a
envelope
with
a
stamp
on
it
,
and
put
yer
address
on
*NL*
it
,
I
'll
find
out
where
Sam
is
to
be
found
and
post
it
ye
to-night
.
But
*NL*
ye
'd
better
be
up
arter
`
im
soon
in
the
mornin
'
,
or
maybe
ye
wo
n't
ketch
*NL*
`
im
;
for
Sam
gets
off
main
early
,
never
mind
the
booze
the
night
afore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
practical
,
so
one
of
the
children
went
off
with
a
penny
to
*NL*
buy
an
envelope
and
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
to
keep
the
change
.
When
she
*NL*
came
back
,
I
addressed
the
envelope
and
stamped
it
,
and
when
Smollet
had
*NL*
again
faithfully
promised
to
post
the
address
when
found
,
I
took
my
way
*NL*
to
home
.
We
're
on
the
track
anyhow
.
I
am
tired
to-night
,
and
want
sleep
.
*NL*
Mina
is
fast
asleep
,
and
looks
a
little
too
pale
;
her
eyes
look
as
*NL*
though
she
had
been
crying
.
Poor
dear
,
I
've
no
doubt
it
frets
her
to
be
*NL*
kept
in
the
dark
,
and
it
may
make
her
doubly
anxious
about
me
and
the
*NL*
others
.
But
it
is
best
as
it
is
.
It
is
better
to
be
disappointed
and
*NL*
worried
in
such
a
way
now
than
to
have
her
nerve
broken
.
The
doctors
*NL*
were
quite
right
to
insist
on
her
being
kept
out
of
this
dreadful
*NL*
business
.
I
must
be
firm
,
for
on
me
this
particular
burden
of
silence
*NL*
must
rest
.
I
shall
not
ever
enter
on
the
subject
with
her
under
any
*NL*
circumstances
.
Indeed
,
it
may
not
be
a
hard
task
,
after
all
,
for
she
*NL*
herself
has
become
reticent
on
the
subject
,
and
has
not
spoken
of
the
*NL*
Count
or
his
doings
ever
since
we
told
her
of
our
decision
.

_
2
October
,
evening
.
_
--
A
long
and
trying
and
exciting
day
.
By
the
first
*NL*
post
I
got
my
directed
envelope
with
a
dirty
scrap
of
paper
enclosed
,
on
*NL*
which
was
written
with
a
carpenter
's
pencil
in
a
sprawling
hand
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sam
Bloxam
,
Korkrans
,
4
,
Poters
Cort
,
Bartel
Street
,
Walworth
.
Arsk
for
*NL*
the
depite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
the
letter
in
bed
,
and
rose
without
waking
Mina
.
She
looked
heavy
*NL*
and
sleepy
and
pale
,
and
far
from
well
.
I
determined
not
to
wake
her
,
*NL*
but
that
,
when
I
should
return
from
this
new
search
,
I
would
arrange
for
*NL*
her
going
back
to
Exeter
.
I
think
she
would
be
happier
in
our
own
home
,
*NL*
with
her
daily
tasks
to
interest
her
,
than
in
being
here
amongst
us
and
*NL*
in
ignorance
.
I
only
saw
Dr.
Seward
for
a
moment
,
and
told
him
where
I
*NL*
was
off
to
,
promising
to
come
back
and
tell
the
rest
so
soon
as
I
should
*NL*
have
found
out
anything
.
I
drove
to
Walworth
and
found
,
with
some
*NL*
difficulty
,
Potter
's
Court
.
Mr.
Smollet
's
spelling
misled
me
,
as
I
asked
*NL*
for
Poter
's
Court
instead
of
Potter
's
Court
.
However
,
when
I
had
found
*NL*
the
court
,
I
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
Corcoran
's
lodging-house
.
*NL*
When
I
asked
the
man
who
came
to
the
door
for
the
``
depite
,
''
he
shook
his
*NL*
head
,
and
said
:
``
I
dunno
`
im
.
There
ai
n't
no
such
a
person
`
ere
;
I
never
*NL*
`
eard
of
`
im
in
all
my
bloomin
'
days
.
Do
n't
believe
there
ai
n't
nobody
*NL*
of
that
kind
livin
'
ere
or
anywheres
.
''
I
took
out
Smollet
's
letter
,
and
*NL*
as
I
read
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
lesson
of
the
spelling
of
the
name
*NL*
of
the
court
might
guide
me
.
``
What
are
you
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
the
depity
,
''
he
answered
.
I
saw
at
once
that
I
was
on
the
right
*NL*
track
;
phonetic
spelling
had
again
misled
me
.
A
half-crown
tip
put
the
*NL*
deputy
's
knowledge
at
my
disposal
,
and
I
learned
that
Mr.
Bloxam
,
who
*NL*
had
slept
off
the
remains
of
his
beer
on
the
previous
night
at
*NL*
Corcoran
's
,
had
left
for
his
work
at
Poplar
at
five
o'clock
that
*NL*
morning
.
He
could
not
tell
me
where
the
place
of
work
was
situated
,
but
*NL*
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
it
was
some
kind
of
a
``
new-fangled
ware'us
''
;
*NL*
and
with
this
slender
clue
I
had
to
start
for
Poplar
.
It
was
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
before
I
got
any
satisfactory
hint
of
such
a
building
,
and
this
*NL*
I
got
at
a
coffee-shop
,
where
some
workmen
were
having
their
dinner
.
One
*NL*
of
these
suggested
that
there
was
being
erected
at
Cross
Angel
Street
a
*NL*
new
``
cold
storage
''
building
;
and
as
this
suited
the
condition
of
a
*NL*
``
new-fangled
ware'us
,
''
I
at
once
drove
to
it
.
An
interview
with
a
surly
*NL*
gatekeeper
and
a
surlier
foreman
,
both
of
whom
were
appeased
with
the
*NL*
coin
of
the
realm
,
put
me
on
the
track
of
Bloxam
;
he
was
sent
for
on
my
*NL*
suggesting
that
I
was
willing
to
pay
his
day
's
wages
to
his
foreman
for
*NL*
the
privilege
of
asking
him
a
few
questions
on
a
private
matter
.
He
was
*NL*
a
smart
enough
fellow
,
though
rough
of
speech
and
bearing
.
When
I
had
*NL*
promised
to
pay
for
his
information
and
given
him
an
earnest
,
he
told
me
*NL*
that
he
had
made
two
journeys
between
Carfax
and
a
house
in
Piccadilly
,
*NL*
and
had
taken
from
this
house
to
the
latter
nine
great
boxes
--
``
main
*NL*
heavy
ones
''
--
with
a
horse
and
cart
hired
by
him
for
this
purpose
.
I
*NL*
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
the
number
of
the
house
in
Piccadilly
,
to
*NL*
which
he
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
guv
`
nor
,
I
forgits
the
number
,
but
it
was
only
a
few
doors
from
a
*NL*
big
white
church
or
somethink
of
the
kind
,
not
long
built
.
It
was
a
*NL*
dusty
old
`
ouse
,
too
,
though
nothin
'
to
the
dustiness
of
the
`
ouse
we
*NL*
tooked
the
bloomin
'
boxes
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
get
into
the
houses
if
they
were
both
empty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
the
old
party
what
engaged
me
a-waitin

in
the

ouse

He
`

me
to
lift
the
boxes
and
put
them
in
the
dray

Curse
*NL*
me
,
but
he
was
the
strongest
chap
I
ever
struck
,
an

him
a
old
feller
,
*NL*
with
a
white
moustache
,
one
that
thin
you
would
think
he
could
n't
throw
*NL*
a
shadder

''
*NL*
*NL*
How
this
phrase
thrilled
through
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
'
e
took
up
`
is
end
o

the
boxes

they

neither

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
get
into
the
house
in
Piccadilly
?

I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
there
too

He
must

off
and

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yus

there
was
five

the

I

well

I
got

I
*NL*
interrupted
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
the
boxes
left
in
the
hall

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yus
;
it
was
a
big

,
an
'
there
was
nothin
'
else
in
it

I
made
one
*NL*
more
attempt
to
further
matters
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
have
any
key
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
used
no
key
nor
nothink

The
old
gent
,
he
opened
the
door
`
isself
*NL*
an

shut
it
again
when
I
druv
off
.
I
do
n't
remember
the
last
time
--
but
*NL*
that
was
the
beer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
ca
n't
remember
the
number
of
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
But
ye
need
n't
have
no
difficulty
about
that
.
It
's
a
`
igh
`
un
*NL*
with
a
stone
front
with
a
bow
on
it
,
an

`

up

I
*NL*
know
them

so
much

they

took
one
of
them

by

shoulder
and
was
like
to
throw
`
im
down
the
steps
,
till
the
lot
*NL*
of
them
went
away
cussin
'
.
''
I
thought
that
with
this
description
I
could
*NL*
find
the
house
,
so
,
having
paid
my
friend
for
his
information
,
I
started
*NL*
off
for
Piccadilly
.
I
had
gained
a
new
painful
experience
;
the
Count
*NL*
could
,
it
was
evident
,
handle
the
earth-boxes
himself
.
If
so
,
time
was
*NL*
precious
;
for
,
now
that
he
had
achieved
a
certain
amount
of
*NL*
distribution
,
he
could
,
by
choosing
his
own
time
,
complete
the
task
*NL*
unobserved
.
At
Piccadilly
Circus
I
discharged
my
cab
,
and
walked
*NL*
westward
;
beyond
the
Junior
Constitutional
I
came
across
the
house
*NL*
described
,
and
was
satisfied
that
this
was
the
next
of
the
lairs
*NL*
arranged
by
Dracula
.
The
house
looked
as
though
it
had
been
long
*NL*
untenanted
.
The
windows
were
encrusted
with
dust
,
and
the
shutters
were
*NL*
up
.
All
the
framework
was
black
with
time
,
and
from
the
iron
the
paint
*NL*
had
mostly
scaled
away
.
It
was
evident
that
up
to
lately
there
had
been
*NL*
a
large
notice-board
in
front
of
the
balcony
;
it
had
,
however
,
been
*NL*
roughly
torn
away
,
the
uprights
which
had
supported
it
still
remaining
.
*NL*
Behind
the
rails
of
the
balcony
I
saw
there
were
some
loose
boards
,
*NL*
whose
raw
edges
looked
white
.
I
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
have
*NL*
been
able
to
see
the
notice-board
intact
,
as
it
would
,
perhaps
,
have
*NL*
given
some
clue
to
the
ownership
of
the
house
.
I
remembered
my
*NL*
experience
of
the
investigation
and
purchase
of
Carfax
,
and
I
could
not
*NL*
but
feel
that
if
I
could
find
the
former
owner
there
might
be
some
means
*NL*
discovered
of
gaining
access
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
at
present
nothing
to
be
learned
from
the
Piccadilly
side
,
and
*NL*
nothing
could
be
done
;
so
I
went
round
to
the
back
to
see
if
anything
*NL*
could
be
gathered
from
this
quarter
.
The
mews
were
active
,
the
*NL*
Piccadilly
houses
being
mostly
in
occupation
.
I
asked
one
or
two
of
the
*NL*
grooms
and
helpers
whom
I
saw
around
if
they
could
tell
me
anything
*NL*
about
the
empty
house
.
One
of
them
said
that
he
heard
it
had
lately
been
*NL*
taken
,
but
he
could
n't
say
from
whom
.
He
told
me
,
however
,
that
up
to
*NL*
very
lately
there
had
been
a
notice-board
of
``
For
Sale
''
up
,
and
that
*NL*
perhaps
Mitchell
,
Sons
,
&
Candy
,
the
house
agents
,
could
tell
me
*NL*
something
,
as
he
thought
he
remembered
seeing
the
name
of
that
firm
on
*NL*
the
board
.
I
did
not
wish
to
seem
too
eager
,
or
to
let
my
informant
know
*NL*
or
guess
too
much
,
so
,
thanking
him
in
the
usual
manner
,
I
strolled
*NL*
away
.
It
was
now
growing
dusk
,
and
the
autumn
night
was
closing
in
,
so
I
*NL*
did
not
lose
any
time
.
Having
learned
the
address
of
Mitchell
,
Sons
,
&
*NL*
Candy
from
a
directory
at
the
Berkeley
,
I
was
soon
at
their
office
in
*NL*
Sackville
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
who
saw
me
was
particularly
suave
in
manner
,
but
*NL*
uncommunicative
in
equal
proportion
.
Having
once
told
me
that
the
*NL*
Piccadilly
house
--
which
throughout
our
interview
he
called
a
*NL*
``
mansion
''
--
was
sold
,
he
considered
my
business
as
concluded
.
When
I
*NL*
asked
who
had
purchased
it
,
he
opened
his
eyes
a
thought
wider
,
and
*NL*
paused
a
few
seconds
before
replying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
sold
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
I
said
,
with
equal
politeness
,
``
but
I
have
a
special
reason
*NL*
for
wishing
to
know
who
purchased
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
paused
longer
,
and
raised
his
eyebrows
still
more
.
``
It
is
sold
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
was
again
his
laconic
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
''
I
said
,
``
you
do
not
mind
letting
me
know
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
mind
,
''
he
answered
.
``
The
affairs
of
their
clients
are
*NL*
absolutely
safe
in
the
hands
of
Mitchell
,
Sons
,
&
Candy
.
''
This
was
*NL*
manifestly
a
prig
of
the
first
water
,
and
there
was
no
use
arguing
with
*NL*
him
.
I
thought
I
had
best
meet
him
on
his
own
ground
,
so
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
clients
,
sir
,
are
happy
in
having
so
resolute
a
guardian
of
their
*NL*
confidence
.
I
am
myself
a
professional
man
.
''
Here
I
handed
him
my
card
.
*NL*
``
In
this
instance
I
am
not
prompted
by
curiosity
;
I
act
on
the
part
of
*NL*
Lord
Godalming
,
who
wishes
to
know
something
of
the
property
which
was
,
*NL*
he
understood
,
lately
for
sale
.
''
These
words
put
a
different
complexion
*NL*
on
affairs
.
He
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
like
to
oblige
you
if
I
could
,
Mr.
Harker
,
and
especially
would
*NL*
I
like
to
oblige
his
lordship
.
We
once
carried
out
a
small
matter
of
*NL*
renting
some
chambers
for
him
when
he
was
the
Honourable
Arthur
*NL*
Holmwood
.
If
you
will
let
me
have
his
lordship
's
address
I
will
consult
*NL*
the
House
on
the
subject
,
and
will
,
in
any
case
,
communicate
with
his
*NL*
lordship
by
to-night
's
post
.
It
will
be
a
pleasure
if
we
can
so
far
*NL*
deviate
from
our
rules
as
to
give
the
required
information
to
his
*NL*
lordship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
wanted
to
secure
a
friend
,
and
not
to
make
an
enemy
,
so
I
thanked
him
,
*NL*
gave
the
address
at
Dr.
Seward
's
and
came
away
.
It
was
now
dark
,
and
I
*NL*
was
tired
and
hungry
.
I
got
a
cup
of
tea
at
the
Aerated
Bread
Company
*NL*
and
came
down
to
Purfleet
by
the
next
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
all
the
others
at
home
.
Mina
was
looking
tired
and
pale
,
but
she
*NL*
made
a
gallant
effort
to
be
bright
and
cheerful
,
it
wrung
my
heart
to
*NL*
think
that
I
had
had
to
keep
anything
from
her
and
so
caused
her
*NL*
inquietude
.
Thank
God
,
this
will
be
the
last
night
of
her
looking
on
at
*NL*
our
conferences
,
and
feeling
the
sting
of
our
not
showing
our
*NL*
confidence
.
It
took
all
my
courage
to
hold
to
the
wise
resolution
of
*NL*
keeping
her
out
of
our
grim
task
.
She
seems
somehow
more
reconciled
;
or
*NL*
else
the
very
subject
seems
to
have
become
repugnant
to
her
,
for
when
*NL*
any
accidental
allusion
is
made
she
actually
shudders
.
I
am
glad
we
*NL*
made
our
resolution
in
time
,
as
with
such
a
feeling
as
this
,
our
growing
*NL*
knowledge
would
be
torture
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
tell
the
others
of
the
day
's
discovery
till
we
were
alone
;
*NL*
so
after
dinner
--
followed
by
a
little
music
to
save
appearances
even
*NL*
amongst
ourselves
--
I
took
Mina
to
her
room
and
left
her
to
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
The
dear
girl
was
more
affectionate
with
me
than
ever
,
and
clung
to
me
*NL*
as
though
she
would
detain
me
;
but
there
was
much
to
be
talked
of
and
I
*NL*
came
away
.
Thank
God
,
the
ceasing
of
telling
things
has
made
no
*NL*
difference
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
down
again
I
found
the
others
all
gathered
round
the
fire
in
*NL*
the
study
.
In
the
train
I
had
written
my
diary
so
far
,
and
simply
read
*NL*
it
off
to
them
as
the
best
means
of
letting
them
get
abreast
of
my
own
*NL*
information
;
when
I
had
finished
Van
Helsing
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
has
been
a
great
day
's
work
,
friend
Jonathan
.
Doubtless
we
are
on
*NL*
the
track
of
the
missing
boxes
.
If
we
find
them
all
in
that
house
,
then
*NL*
our
work
is
near
the
end
.
But
if
there
be
some
missing
,
we
must
search
*NL*
until
we
find
them
.
Then
shall
we
make
our
final
_
coup
_
,
and
hunt
the
*NL*
wretch
to
his
real
death
.
''
We
all
sat
silent
awhile
and
all
at
once
Mr.
*NL*
Morris
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
!
how
are
we
going
to
get
into
that
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
got
into
the
other
,
''
answered
Lord
Godalming
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Art
,
this
is
different
.
We
broke
house
at
Carfax
,
but
we
had
night
*NL*
and
a
walled
park
to
protect
us
.
It
will
be
a
mighty
different
thing
to
*NL*
commit
burglary
in
Piccadilly
,
either
by
day
or
night
.
I
confess
I
do
n't
*NL*
see
how
we
are
going
to
get
in
unless
that
agency
duck
can
find
us
a
key
*NL*
of
some
sort
;
perhaps
we
shall
know
when
you
get
his
letter
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
''
Lord
Godalming
's
brows
contracted
,
and
he
stood
up
and
walked
*NL*
about
the
room
.
By-and-by
he
stopped
and
said
,
turning
from
one
to
*NL*
another
of
us
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quincey
's
head
is
level
.
This
burglary
business
is
getting
serious
;
we
*NL*
got
off
once
all
right
;
but
we
have
now
a
rare
job
on
hand
--
unless
we
*NL*
can
find
the
Count
's
key
basket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
nothing
could
well
be
done
before
morning
,
and
as
it
would
be
at
*NL*
least
advisable
to
wait
till
Lord
Godalming
should
hear
from
Mitchell
's
,
*NL*
we
decided
not
to
take
any
active
step
before
breakfast
time
.
For
a
good
*NL*
while
we
sat
and
smoked
,
discussing
the
matter
in
its
various
lights
and
*NL*
bearings
;
I
took
the
opportunity
of
bringing
this
diary
right
up
to
the
*NL*
moment
.
I
am
very
sleepy
and
shall
go
to
bed
...
*NL*
*NL*
Just
a
line
.
Mina
sleeps
soundly
and
her
breathing
is
regular
.
Her
*NL*
forehead
is
puckered
up
into
little
wrinkles
,
as
though
she
thinks
even
*NL*
in
her
sleep
.
She
is
still
too
pale
,
but
does
not
look
so
haggard
as
she
*NL*
did
this
morning
.
To-morrow
will
,
I
hope
,
mend
all
this
;
she
will
be
*NL*
herself
at
home
in
Exeter
.
Oh
,
but
I
am
sleepy
!

_
Dr.
Seward
's
Diary
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
_
1
October
.
_
--
I
am
puzzled
afresh
about
Renfield
.
His
moods
change
so
*NL*
rapidly
that
I
find
it
difficult
to
keep
touch
of
them
,
and
as
they
*NL*
always
mean
something
more
than
his
own
well-being
,
they
form
a
more
*NL*
than
interesting
study
.
This
morning
,
when
I
went
to
see
him
after
his
*NL*
repulse
of
Van
Helsing
,
his
manner
was
that
of
a
man
commanding
destiny
.
*NL*
He
was
,
in
fact
,
commanding
destiny
--
subjectively
.
He
did
not
really
*NL*
care
for
any
of
the
things
of
mere
earth
;
he
was
in
the
clouds
and
*NL*
looked
down
on
all
the
weaknesses
and
wants
of
us
poor
mortals
.
I
*NL*
thought
I
would
improve
the
occasion
and
learn
something
,
so
I
asked
*NL*
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
the
flies
these
times
?
''
He
smiled
on
me
in
quite
a
superior
*NL*
sort
of
way
--
such
a
smile
as
would
have
become
the
face
of
Malvolio
--
as
*NL*
he
answered
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fly
,
my
dear
sir
,
has
one
striking
feature
;
its
wings
are
typical
*NL*
of
the
aerial
powers
of
the
psychic
faculties
.
The
ancients
did
well
*NL*
when
they
typified
the
soul
as
a
butterfly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
would
push
his
analogy
to
its
utmost
logically
,
so
I
said
*NL*
quickly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
a
soul
you
are
after
now
,
is
it
?
''
His
madness
foiled
his
*NL*
reason
,
and
a
puzzled
look
spread
over
his
face
as
,
shaking
his
head
*NL*
with
a
decision
which
I
had
but
seldom
seen
in
him
,
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
oh
no
!
I
want
no
souls
.
Life
is
all
I
want
.
''
Here
he
brightened
*NL*
up
;
``
I
am
pretty
indifferent
about
it
at
present
.
Life
is
all
right
;
I
*NL*
have
all
I
want
.
You
must
get
a
new
patient
,
doctor
,
if
you
wish
to
*NL*
study
zooephagy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
puzzled
me
a
little
,
so
I
drew
him
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
command
life
;
you
are
a
god
,
I
suppose
?
''
He
smiled
with
an
*NL*
ineffably
benign
superiority
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
Far
be
it
from
me
to
arrogate
to
myself
the
attributes
of
the
*NL*
Deity
.
I
am
not
even
concerned
in
His
especially
spiritual
doings
.
If
I
*NL*
may
state
my
intellectual
position
I
am
,
so
far
as
concerns
things
*NL*
purely
terrestrial
,
somewhat
in
the
position
which
Enoch
occupied
*NL*
spiritually
!
''
This
was
a
poser
to
me
.
I
could
not
at
the
moment
recall
*NL*
Enoch
's
appositeness
;
so
I
had
to
ask
a
simple
question
,
though
I
felt
*NL*
that
by
so
doing
I
was
lowering
myself
in
the
eyes
of
the
lunatic
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
with
Enoch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
walked
with
God
.
''
I
could
not
see
the
analogy
,
but
did
not
*NL*
like
to
admit
it
;
so
I
harked
back
to
what
he
had
denied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
do
n't
care
about
life
and
you
do
n't
want
souls
.
Why
not
?
''
I
put
*NL*
my
question
quickly
and
somewhat
sternly
,
on
purpose
to
disconcert
him
.
*NL*
The
effort
succeeded
;
for
an
instant
he
unconsciously
relapsed
into
his
*NL*
old
servile
manner
,
bent
low
before
me
,
and
actually
fawned
upon
me
as
*NL*
he
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
any
souls
,
indeed
,
indeed
!
I
do
n't
.
I
could
n't
use
them
if
*NL*
I
had
them
;
they
would
be
no
manner
of
use
to
me
.
I
could
n't
eat
them
*NL*
or
--
''
He
suddenly
stopped
and
the
old
cunning
look
spread
over
his
*NL*
face
,
like
a
wind-sweep
on
the
surface
of
the
water
.
``
And
doctor
,
as
to
*NL*
life
,
what
is
it
after
all
?
When
you
've
got
all
you
require
,
and
you
*NL*
know
that
you
will
never
want
,
that
is
all
.
I
have
friends
--
good
*NL*
friends
--
like
you
,
Dr.
Seward
''
;
this
was
said
with
a
leer
of
*NL*
inexpressible
cunning
.
``
I
know
that
I
shall
never
lack
the
means
of
*NL*
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
that
through
the
cloudiness
of
his
insanity
he
saw
some
*NL*
antagonism
in
me
,
for
he
at
once
fell
back
on
the
last
refuge
of
such
as
*NL*
he
--
a
dogged
silence
.
After
a
short
time
I
saw
that
for
the
present
it
*NL*
was
useless
to
speak
to
him
.
He
was
sulky
,
and
so
I
came
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
day
he
sent
for
me
.
Ordinarily
I
would
not
have
come
*NL*
without
special
reason
,
but
just
at
present
I
am
so
interested
in
him
*NL*
that
I
would
gladly
make
an
effort
.
Besides
,
I
am
glad
to
have
anything
*NL*
to
help
to
pass
the
time
.
Harker
is
out
,
following
up
clues
;
and
so
are
*NL*
Lord
Godalming
and
Quincey
.
Van
Helsing
sits
in
my
study
poring
over
the
*NL*
record
prepared
by
the
Harkers
;
he
seems
to
think
that
by
accurate
*NL*
knowledge
of
all
details
he
will
light
upon
some
clue
.
He
does
not
wish
*NL*
to
be
disturbed
in
the
work
,
without
cause
.
I
would
have
taken
him
with
*NL*
me
to
see
the
patient
,
only
I
thought
that
after
his
last
repulse
he
*NL*
might
not
care
to
go
again
.
There
was
also
another
reason
:
Renfield
*NL*
might
not
speak
so
freely
before
a
third
person
as
when
he
and
I
were
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
him
sitting
out
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
on
his
stool
,
a
pose
*NL*
which
is
generally
indicative
of
some
mental
energy
on
his
part
.
When
I
*NL*
came
in
,
he
said
at
once
,
as
though
the
question
had
been
waiting
on
his
*NL*
lips
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
souls
?
''
It
was
evident
then
that
my
surmise
had
been
*NL*
correct
.
Unconscious
cerebration
was
doing
its
work
,
even
with
the
*NL*
lunatic
.
I
determined
to
have
the
matter
out
.
``
What
about
them
*NL*
yourself
?
''
I
asked
.
He
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
but
looked
all
round
*NL*
him
,
and
up
and
down
,
as
though
he
expected
to
find
some
inspiration
for
*NL*
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
any
souls
!
''
he
said
in
a
feeble
,
apologetic
way
.
The
*NL*
matter
seemed
preying
on
his
mind
,
and
so
I
determined
to
use
it
--
to
``
be
*NL*
cruel
only
to
be
kind
.
''
So
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
life
,
and
you
want
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
but
that
is
all
right
;
you
need
n't
worry
about
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
I
asked
,
``
how
are
we
to
get
the
life
without
getting
the
soul
*NL*
also
?
''
This
seemed
to
puzzle
him
,
so
I
followed
it
up
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
time
you
'll
have
some
time
when
you
're
flying
out
there
,
with
*NL*
the
souls
of
thousands
of
flies
and
spiders
and
birds
and
cats
buzzing
*NL*
and
twittering
and
miauing
all
round
you
.
You
've
got
their
lives
,
you
*NL*
know
,
and
you
must
put
up
with
their
souls
!
''
Something
seemed
to
affect
*NL*
his
imagination
,
for
he
put
his
fingers
to
his
ears
and
shut
his
eyes
,
*NL*
screwing
them
up
tightly
just
as
a
small
boy
does
when
his
face
is
being
*NL*
soaped
.
There
was
something
pathetic
in
it
that
touched
me
;
it
also
gave
*NL*
me
a
lesson
,
for
it
seemed
that
before
me
was
a
child
--
only
a
child
,
*NL*
though
the
features
were
worn
,
and
the
stubble
on
the
jaws
was
white
.
It
*NL*
was
evident
that
he
was
undergoing
some
process
of
mental
disturbance
,
*NL*
and
,
knowing
how
his
past
moods
had
interpreted
things
seemingly
foreign
*NL*
to
himself
,
I
thought
I
would
enter
into
his
mind
as
well
as
I
could
and
*NL*
go
with
him
.
The
first
step
was
to
restore
confidence
,
so
I
asked
him
,
*NL*
speaking
pretty
loud
so
that
he
would
hear
me
through
his
closed
ears
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
some
sugar
to
get
your
flies
round
again
?
''
He
seemed
to
*NL*
wake
up
all
at
once
,
and
shook
his
head
.
With
a
laugh
he
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
!
flies
are
poor
things
,
after
all
!
''
After
a
pause
he
added
,
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
want
their
souls
buzzing
round
me
,
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
spiders
?
''
I
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blow
spiders
!
What
's
the
use
of
spiders
?
There
is
n't
anything
in
them
*NL*
to
eat
or
''
--
he
stopped
suddenly
,
as
though
reminded
of
a
forbidden
*NL*
topic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
so
!
''
I
thought
to
myself
,
``
this
is
the
second
time
he
has
suddenly
*NL*
stopped
at
the
word
`
drink
'
;
what
does
it
mean
?
''
Renfield
seemed
himself
*NL*
aware
of
having
made
a
lapse
,
for
he
hurried
on
,
as
though
to
distract
*NL*
my
attention
from
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
take
any
stock
at
all
in
such
matters
.
`
Rats
and
mice
and
such
*NL*
small
deer
,
'
as
Shakespeare
has
it
,
`
chicken-feed
of
the
larder
'
they
*NL*
might
be
called
.
I
'm
past
all
that
sort
of
nonsense
.
You
might
as
well
*NL*
ask
a
man
to
eat
molecules
with
a
pair
of
chop-sticks
,
as
to
try
to
*NL*
interest
me
about
the
lesser
carnivora
,
when
I
know
of
what
is
before
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
want
big
things
that
you
can
make
your
teeth
meet
*NL*
in
?
How
would
you
like
to
breakfast
on
elephant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ridiculous
nonsense
you
are
talking
!
''
He
was
getting
too
wide
*NL*
awake
,
so
I
thought
I
would
press
him
hard
.
``
I
wonder
,
''
I
said
*NL*
reflectively
,
``
what
an
elephant
's
soul
is
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
I
desired
was
obtained
,
for
he
at
once
fell
from
his
*NL*
high-horse
and
became
a
child
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
an
elephant
's
soul
,
or
any
soul
at
all
!
''
he
said
.
For
a
*NL*
few
moments
he
sat
despondently
.
Suddenly
he
jumped
to
his
feet
,
with
*NL*
his
eyes
blazing
and
all
the
signs
of
intense
cerebral
excitement
.
``
To
*NL*
hell
with
you
and
your
souls
!
''
he
shouted
.
``
Why
do
you
plague
me
about
*NL*
souls
?
Have
n't
I
got
enough
to
worry
,
and
pain
,
and
distract
me
already
,
*NL*
without
thinking
of
souls
!
''
He
looked
so
hostile
that
I
thought
he
was
*NL*
in
for
another
homicidal
fit
,
so
I
blew
my
whistle
.
The
instant
,
*NL*
however
,
that
I
did
so
he
became
calm
,
and
said
apologetically
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
Doctor
;
I
forgot
myself
.
You
do
not
need
any
help
.
I
am
so
*NL*
worried
in
my
mind
that
I
am
apt
to
be
irritable
.
If
you
only
knew
the
*NL*
problem
I
have
to
face
,
and
that
I
am
working
out
,
you
would
pity
,
and
*NL*
tolerate
,
and
pardon
me
.
Pray
do
not
put
me
in
a
strait-waistcoat
.
I
*NL*
want
to
think
and
I
can
not
think
freely
when
my
body
is
confined
.
I
am
*NL*
sure
you
will
understand
!
''
He
had
evidently
self-control
;
so
when
the
*NL*
attendants
came
I
told
them
not
to
mind
,
and
they
withdrew
.
Renfield
*NL*
watched
them
go
;
when
the
door
was
closed
he
said
,
with
considerable
*NL*
dignity
and
sweetness
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Seward
,
you
have
been
very
considerate
towards
me
.
Believe
me
that
*NL*
I
am
very
,
very
grateful
to
you
!
''
I
thought
it
well
to
leave
him
in
this
*NL*
mood
,
and
so
I
came
away
.
There
is
certainly
something
to
ponder
over
in
*NL*
this
man
's
state
.
Several
points
seem
to
make
what
the
American
*NL*
interviewer
calls
``
a
story
,
''
if
one
could
only
get
them
in
proper
order
.
*NL*
Here
they
are
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Will
not
mention
``
drinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fears
the
thought
of
being
burdened
with
the
``
soul
''
of
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Has
no
dread
of
wanting
``
life
''
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despises
the
meaner
forms
of
life
altogether
,
though
he
dreads
being
*NL*
haunted
by
their
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Logically
all
these
things
point
one
way
!
he
has
assurance
of
some
kind
*NL*
that
he
will
acquire
some
higher
life
.
He
dreads
the
consequence
--
the
*NL*
burden
of
a
soul
.
Then
it
is
a
human
life
he
looks
to
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
assurance
--
?
*NL*
*NL*
Merciful
God
!
the
Count
has
been
to
him
,
and
there
is
some
new
scheme
of
*NL*
terror
afoot
!

_
Later

_
--
I
went
after
my
round
to
Van
Helsing
and
told
him
my
*NL*
suspicion
.
He
grew
very
grave
;
and
,
after
thinking
the
matter
over
for
a
*NL*
while
asked
me
to
take
him
to
Renfield
.
I
did
so
.
As
we
came
to
the
door
*NL*
we
heard
the
lunatic
within
singing
gaily
,
as
he
used
to
do
in
the
time
*NL*
which
now
seems
so
long
ago
.
When
we
entered
we
saw
with
amazement
that
*NL*
he
had
spread
out
his
sugar
as
of
old
;
the
flies
,
lethargic
with
the
*NL*
autumn
,
were
beginning
to
buzz
into
the
room
.
We
tried
to
make
him
talk
*NL*
of
the
subject
of
our
previous
conversation
,
but
he
would
not
attend
.
He
*NL*
went
on
with
his
singing
,
just
as
though
we
had
not
been
present
.
He
had
*NL*
got
a
scrap
of
paper
and
was
folding
it
into
a
note-book
.
We
had
to
come
*NL*
away
as
ignorant
as
we
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
is
a
curious
case
indeed
;
we
must
watch
him
to-night

I
placed
a
man
in
the
corridor
last
night
,
and
told
him
to
*NL*
make
an
accurate
note
of
any
sound
he
might
hear
from
Renfield
's
room
,
*NL*
and
gave
him
instructions
that
if
there
should
be
anything
strange
he
*NL*
was
to
call
me
.
After
dinner
,
when
we
had
all
gathered
round
the
fire
*NL*
in
the
study
--
Mrs.
Harker
having
gone
to
bed
--
we
discussed
the
attempts
*NL*
and
discoveries
of
the
day
.
Harker
was
the
only
one
who
had
any
result
,
*NL*
and
we
are
in
great
hopes
that
his
clue
may
be
an
important
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
going
to
bed
I
went
round
to
the
patient
's
room
and
looked
in
*NL*
through
the
observation
trap
.
He
was
sleeping
soundly
,
and
his
heart
*NL*
rose
and
fell
with
regular
respiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
morning
the
man
on
duty
reported
to
me
that
a
little
after
midnight
*NL*
he
was
restless
and
kept
saying
his
prayers
somewhat
loudly
.
I
asked
him
*NL*
if
that
was
all
;
he
replied
that
it
was
all
he
heard
.
There
was
*NL*
something
about
his
manner
so
suspicious
that
I
asked
him
point
blank
if
*NL*
he
had
been
asleep
.
He
denied
sleep
,
but
admitted
to
having
``
dozed
''
for
*NL*
a
while
.
It
is
too
bad
that
men
can
not
be
trusted
unless
they
are
*NL*
watched
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-day
Harker
is
out
following
up
his
clue
,
and
Art
and
Quincey
are
*NL*
looking
after
horses
.
Godalming
thinks
that
it
will
be
well
to
have
*NL*
horses
always
in
readiness
,
for
when
we
get
the
information
which
we
*NL*
seek
there
will
be
no
time
to
lose
.
We
must
sterilise
all
the
imported
*NL*
earth
between
sunrise
and
sunset
;
we
shall
thus
catch
the
Count
at
his
*NL*
weakest
,
and
without
a
refuge
to
fly
to
.
Van
Helsing
is
off
to
the
*NL*
British
Museum
looking
up
some
authorities
on
ancient
medicine
.
The
old
*NL*
physicians
took
account
of
things
which
their
followers
do
not
accept
,
*NL*
and
the
Professor
is
searching
for
witch
and
demon
cures
which
may
be
*NL*
useful
to
us
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sometimes
think
we
must
be
all
mad
and
that
we
shall
wake
to
sanity
in
*NL*
strait-waistcoats
.

We

We
seem
at

to
be
on
the
track
,
and
our
*NL*
work
of
to-morrow
may
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
.
I
wonder
if
*NL*
Renfield
's
quiet
has
anything
to
do
with
this
.
His
moods
have
so
*NL*
followed
the
doings
of
the
Count
,
that
the
coming
destruction
of
the
*NL*
monster
may
be
carried
to
him
in
some
subtle
way
.
If
we
could
only
get
*NL*
some
hint
as
to
what
passed
in
his
mind
,
between
the
time
of
my
argument
*NL*
with
him
to-day
and
his
resumption
of
fly-catching
,
it
might
afford
us
a
*NL*
valuable
clue
.
He
is
now
seemingly
quiet
for
a
spell
...
Is
he
?
--
That
*NL*
wild
yell
seemed
to
come
from
his
room
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
The
attendant
came
bursting
into
my
room
and
told
me
that
Renfield
had
*NL*
somehow
met
with
some
accident
.
He
had
heard
him
yell
;
and
when
he
went
*NL*
to
him
found
him
lying
on
his
face
on
the
floor
,
all
covered
with
blood
.

must
go
at
once

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
DR.
SEWARD
'S
DIARY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
3
October
.
_
--
Let
me
put
down
with
exactness
all
that
happened
,
as
well
*NL*
as
I
can
remember
it
,
since
last
I
made
an
entry
.
Not
a
detail
that
I
*NL*
can
recall
must
be
forgotten
;
in
all
calmness
I
must
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
Renfield
's
room
I
found
him
lying
on
the
floor
on
his
*NL*
left
side
in
a
glittering
pool
of
blood
.
When
I
went
to
move
him
,
it
*NL*
became
at
once
apparent
that
he
had
received
some
terrible
injuries
;
*NL*
there
seemed
none
of
that
unity
of
purpose
between
the
parts
of
the
body
*NL*
which
marks
even
lethargic
sanity
.
As
the
face
was
exposed
I
could
see
*NL*
that
it
was
horribly
bruised
,
as
though
it
had
been
beaten
against
the
*NL*
floor
--
indeed
it
was
from
the
face
wounds
that
the
pool
of
blood
*NL*
originated
.
The
attendant
who
was
kneeling
beside
the
body
said
to
me
as
*NL*
we
turned
him
over
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
sir
,
his
back
is
broken
.
See
,
both
his
right
arm
and
leg
and
*NL*
the
whole
side
of
his
face
are
paralysed
.
''
How
such
a
thing
could
have
*NL*
happened
puzzled
the
attendant
beyond
measure
.
He
seemed
quite
*NL*
bewildered
,
and
his
brows
were
gathered
in
as
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
understand
the
two
things
.
He
could
mark
his
face
like
that
by
*NL*
beating
his
own
head
on
the
floor
.
I
saw
a
young
woman
do
it
once
at
the
*NL*
Eversfield
Asylum
before
anyone
could
lay
hands
on
her
.
And
I
suppose
he
*NL*
might
have
broke
his
neck
by
falling
out
of
bed
,
if
he
got
in
an
awkward
*NL*
kink
.
But
for
the
life
of
me
I
ca
n't
imagine
how
the
two
things
*NL*
occurred
.
If
his
back
was
broke
,
he
could
n't
beat
his
head
;
and
if
his
*NL*
face
was
like
that
before
the
fall
out
of
bed
,
there
would
be
marks
of
*NL*
it
.
''
I
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
and
ask
him
to
kindly
come
here
at
once
.
I
want
*NL*
him
without
an
instant
's
delay
.
''
The
man
ran
off
,
and
within
a
few
*NL*
minutes
the
Professor
,
in
his
dressing
gown
and
slippers
,
appeared
.
When
*NL*
he
saw
Renfield
on
the
ground
,
he
looked
keenly
at
him
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
then
turned
to
me
.
I
think
he
recognised
my
thought
in
my
eyes
,
for
he
*NL*
said
very
quietly
,
manifestly
for
the
ears
of
the
attendant
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
a
sad
accident
!
He
will
need
very
careful
watching
,
and
much
*NL*
attention
.
I
shall
stay
with
you
myself
;
but
I
shall
first
dress
myself
.
*NL*
If
you
will
remain
I
shall
in
a
few
minutes
join
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
patient
was
now
breathing
stertorously
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
*NL*
he
had
suffered
some
terrible
injury
.
Van
Helsing
returned
with
*NL*
extraordinary
celerity
,
bearing
with
him
a
surgical
case
.
He
had
*NL*
evidently
been
thinking
and
had
his
mind
made
up
;
for
,
almost
before
he
*NL*
looked
at
the
patient
,
he
whispered
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
the
attendant
away
.
We
must
be
alone
with
him
when
he
becomes
*NL*
conscious
,
after
the
operation
.
''
So
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
will
do
now
,
Simmons
.
We
have
done
all
that
we
can
at
*NL*
present
.
You
had
better
go
your
round
,
and
Dr.
Van
Helsing
will
operate
.
*NL*
Let
me
know
instantly
if
there
be
anything
unusual
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
withdrew
,
and
we
went
into
a
strict
examination
of
the
patient
.
*NL*
The
wounds
of
the
face
was
superficial
;
the
real
injury
was
a
depressed
*NL*
fracture
of
the
skull
,
extending
right
up
through
the
motor
area
.
The
*NL*
Professor
thought
a
moment
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
reduce
the
pressure
and
get
back
to
normal
conditions
,
as
far
*NL*
as
can
be
;
the
rapidity
of
the
suffusion
shows
the
terrible
nature
of
*NL*
his
injury
.
The
whole
motor
area
seems
affected
.
The
suffusion
of
the
*NL*
brain
will
increase
quickly
,
so
we
must
trephine
at
once
or
it
may
be
*NL*
too
late
.
''
As
he
was
speaking
there
was
a
soft
tapping
at
the
door
.
I
*NL*
went
over
and
opened
it
and
found
in
the
corridor
without
,
Arthur
and
*NL*
Quincey
in
pajamas
and
slippers
:
the
former
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
your
man
call
up
Dr.
Van
Helsing
and
tell
him
of
an
accident
.
*NL*
So
I
woke
Quincey
or
rather
called
for
him
as
he
was
not
asleep
.
Things
*NL*
are
moving
too
quickly
and
too
strangely
for
sound
sleep
for
any
of
us
*NL*
these
times
.
I
've
been
thinking
that
to-morrow
night
will
not
see
things
*NL*
as
they
have
been
.
We
'll
have
to
look
back
--
and
forward
a
little
more
*NL*
than
we
have
done
.
May
we
come
in
?
''
I
nodded
,
and
held
the
door
open
*NL*
till
they
had
entered
;
then
I
closed
it
again
.
When
Quincey
saw
the
*NL*
attitude
and
state
of
the
patient
,
and
noted
the
horrible
pool
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
he
said
softly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
what
has
happened
to
him
?
Poor
,
poor
devil
!
''
I
told
him
*NL*
briefly
,
and
added
that
we
expected
he
would
recover
consciousness
after
*NL*
the
operation
--
for
a
short
time
,
at
all
events
.
He
went
at
once
and
sat
*NL*
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
,
with
Godalming
beside
him
;
we
all
watched
*NL*
in
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
wait
,
''
said
Van
Helsing
,
``
just
long
enough
to
fix
the
best
*NL*
spot
for
trephining
,
so
that
we
may
most
quickly
and
perfectly
remove
*NL*
the
blood
clot
;
for
it
is
evident
that
the
haemorrhage
is
increasing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
minutes
during
which
we
waited
passed
with
fearful
slowness
.
I
had
a
*NL*
horrible
sinking
in
my
heart
,
and
from
Van
Helsing
's
face
I
gathered
*NL*
that
he
felt
some
fear
or
apprehension
as
to
what
was
to
come
.
I
dreaded
*NL*
the
words
that
Renfield
might
speak
.
I
was
positively
afraid
to
think
;
*NL*
but
the
conviction
of
what
was
coming
was
on
me
,
as
I
have
read
of
men
*NL*
who
have
heard
the
death-watch
.
The
poor
man
's
breathing
came
in
*NL*
uncertain
gasps
.
Each
instant
he
seemed
as
though
he
would
open
his
eyes
*NL*
and
speak
;
but
then
would
follow
a
prolonged
stertorous
breath
,
and
he
*NL*
would
relapse
into
a
more
fixed
insensibility
.
Inured
as
I
was
to
sick
*NL*
beds
and
death
,
this
suspense
grew
,
and
grew
upon
me
.
I
could
almost
*NL*
hear
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
;
and
the
blood
surging
through
my
*NL*
temples
sounded
like
blows
from
a
hammer
.
The
silence
finally
became
*NL*
agonising
.
I
looked
at
my
companions
,
one
after
another
,
and
saw
from
*NL*
their
flushed
faces
and
damp
brows
that
they
were
enduring
equal
*NL*
torture
.
There
was
a
nervous
suspense
over
us
all
,
as
though
overhead
*NL*
some
dread
bell
would
peal
out
powerfully
when
we
should
least
expect
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
there
came
a
time
when
it
was
evident
that
the
patient
was
*NL*
sinking
fast
;
he
might
die
at
any
moment
.
I
looked
up
at
the
Professor
*NL*
and
caught
his
eyes
fixed
on
mine
.
His
face
was
sternly
set
as
he
*NL*
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
time
to
lose
.
His
words
may
be
worth
many
lives
;
I
have
*NL*
been
thinking
so
,
as
I
stood
here
.
It
may
be
there
is
a
soul
at
stake
!
*NL*
We
shall
operate
just
above
the
ear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
another
word
he
made
the
operation
.
For
a
few
moments
the
*NL*
breathing
continued
to
be
stertorous
.
Then
there
came
a
breath
so
*NL*
prolonged
that
it
seemed
as
though
it
would
tear
open
his
chest
.
*NL*
Suddenly
his
eyes
opened
,
and
became
fixed
in
a
wild
,
helpless
stare
.
*NL*
This
was
continued
for
a
few
moments
;
then
it
softened
into
a
glad
*NL*
surprise
,
and
from
the
lips
came
a
sigh
of
relief
.
He
moved
*NL*
convulsively
,
and
as
he
did
so
,
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
quiet
,
Doctor
.
Tell
them
to
take
off
the
strait-waistcoat
.
I
*NL*
have
had
a
terrible
dream
,
and
it
has
left
me
so
weak
that
I
can
not
*NL*
move
.
What
's
wrong
with
my
face
?
it
feels
all
swollen
,
and
it
smarts
*NL*
dreadfully
.
''
He
tried
to
turn
his
head
;
but
even
with
the
effort
his
*NL*
eyes
seemed
to
grow
glassy
again
so
I
gently
put
it
back
.
Then
Van
*NL*
Helsing
said
in
a
quiet
grave
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
us
your
dream
,
Mr.
Renfield
.
''
As
he
heard
the
voice
his
face
*NL*
brightened
,
through
its
mutilation
,
and
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
Dr.
Van
Helsing
.
How
good
it
is
of
you
to
be
here
.
Give
me
some
*NL*
water
,
my
lips
are
dry
;
and
I
shall
try
to
tell
you
.
I
dreamed
''
--
he
*NL*
stopped
and
seemed
fainting
,
I
called
quietly
to
Quincey
--
``
The
*NL*
brandy
--
it
is
in
my
study
--
quick
!
''
He
flew
and
returned
with
a
glass
,
*NL*
the
decanter
of
brandy
and
a
carafe
of
water
.
We
moistened
the
parched
*NL*
lips
,
and
the
patient
quickly
revived
.
It
seemed
,
however
,
that
his
poor
*NL*
injured
brain
had
been
working
in
the
interval
,
for
,
when
he
was
quite
*NL*
conscious
,
he
looked
at
me
piercingly
with
an
agonised
confusion
which
I
*NL*
shall
never
forget
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
not
deceive
myself
;
it
was
no
dream
,
but
all
a
grim
reality
.
''
*NL*
Then
his
eyes
roved
round
the
room
;
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
two
*NL*
figures
sitting
patiently
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
not
sure
already
,
I
would
know
from
them
.
''
For
an
instant
his
*NL*
eyes
closed
--
not
with
pain
or
sleep
but
voluntarily
,
as
though
he
were
*NL*
bringing
all
his
faculties
to
bear
;
when
he
opened
them
he
said
,
*NL*
hurriedly
,
and
with
more
energy
than
he
had
yet
displayed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
,
Doctor
,
quick
.
I
am
dying
!
I
feel
that
I
have
but
a
few
minutes
;
*NL*
and
then
I
must
go
back
to
death
--
or
worse
!
Wet
my
lips
with
brandy
*NL*
again
.
I
have
something
that
I
must
say
before
I
die
;
or
before
my
poor
*NL*
crushed
brain
dies
anyhow
.
Thank
you
!
It
was
that
night
after
you
left
*NL*
me
,
when
I
implored
you
to
let
me
go
away
.
I
could
n't
speak
then
,
for
I
*NL*
felt
my
tongue
was
tied
;
but
I
was
as
sane
then
,
except
in
that
way
,
as
*NL*
I
am
now
.
I
was
in
an
agony
of
despair
for
a
long
time
after
you
left
*NL*
me
;
it
seemed
hours
.
Then
there
came
a
sudden
peace
to
me
.
My
brain
*NL*
seemed
to
become
cool
again
,
and
I
realised
where
I
was
.
I
heard
the
*NL*
dogs
bark
behind
our
house
,
but
not
where
He
was
!
''
As
he
spoke
,
Van
*NL*
Helsing
's
eyes
never
blinked
,
but
his
hand
came
out
and
met
mine
and
*NL*
gripped
it
hard
.
He
did
not
,
however
,
betray
himself
;
he
nodded
slightly
*NL*
and
said
:
``
Go
on
,
''
in
a
low
voice
.
Renfield
proceeded
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
up
to
the
window
in
the
mist
,
as
I
had
seen
him
often
before
;
*NL*
but
he
was
solid
then
--
not
a
ghost
,
and
his
eyes
were
fierce
like
a
*NL*
man
's
when
angry
.
He
was
laughing
with
his
red
mouth
;
the
sharp
white
*NL*
teeth
glinted
in
the
moonlight
when
he
turned
to
look
back
over
the
belt
*NL*
of
trees
,
to
where
the
dogs
were
barking
.
I
would
n't
ask
him
to
come
in
*NL*
at
first
,
though
I
knew
he
wanted
to
--
just
as
he
had
wanted
all
along
.
*NL*
Then
he
began
promising
me
things
--
not
in
words
but
by
doing
them
.
''
He
*NL*
was
interrupted
by
a
word
from
the
Professor
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
making
them
happen
;
just
as
he
used
to
send
in
the
flies
when
the
*NL*
sun
was
shining
.
Great
big
fat
ones
with
steel
and
sapphire
on
their
*NL*
wings
;
and
big
moths
,
in
the
night
,
with
skull
and
cross-bones
on
their
*NL*
backs
.
''
Van
Helsing
nodded
to
him
as
he
whispered
to
me
unconsciously
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
_
Acherontia
Aitetropos
of
the
Sphinges
_
--
what
you
call
the
*NL*
`
Death
's
-
head
Moth
'
?
''
The
patient
went
on
without
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
began
to
whisper
:
`
Rats
,
rats
,
rats
!
Hundreds
,
thousands
,
*NL*
millions
of
them
,
and
every
one
a
life
;
and
dogs
to
eat
them
,
and
cats
*NL*
too
.
All
lives
!
all
red
blood
,
with
years
of
life
in
it
;
and
not
merely
*NL*
buzzing
flies
!
'
I
laughed
at
him
,
for
I
wanted
to
see
what
he
could
do
.
*NL*
Then
the
dogs
howled
,
away
beyond
the
dark
trees
in
His
house
.
He
*NL*
beckoned
me
to
the
window
.
I
got
up
and
looked
out
,
and
He
raised
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
seemed
to
call
out
without
using
any
words
.
A
dark
mass
*NL*
spread
over
the
grass
,
coming
on
like
the
shape
of
a
flame
of
fire
;
and
*NL*
then
He
moved
the
mist
to
the
right
and
left
,
and
I
could
see
that
there
*NL*
were
thousands
of
rats
with
their
eyes
blazing
red
--
like
His
,
only
*NL*
smaller
.
He
held
up
his
hand
,
and
they
all
stopped
;
and
I
thought
he
*NL*
seemed
to
be
saying
:
`
All
these
lives
will
I
give
you
,
ay
,
and
many
more
*NL*
and
greater
,
through
countless
ages
,
if
you
will
fall
down
and
worship
*NL*
me
!
'
And
then
a
red
cloud
,
like
the
colour
of
blood
,
seemed
to
close
*NL*
over
my
eyes
;
and
before
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
,
I
found
myself
opening
*NL*
the
sash
and
saying
to
Him
:
`
Come
in
,
Lord
and
Master
!
'
The
rats
were
*NL*
all
gone
,
but
He
slid
into
the
room
through
the
sash
,
though
it
was
only
*NL*
open
an
inch
wide
--
just
as
the
Moon
herself
has
often
come
in
through
*NL*
the
tiniest
crack
and
has
stood
before
me
in
all
her
size
and
*NL*
splendour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
was
weaker
,
so
I
moistened
his
lips
with
the
brandy
again
,
and
*NL*
he
continued
;
but
it
seemed
as
though
his
memory
had
gone
on
working
in
*NL*
the
interval
for
his
story
was
further
advanced
.
I
was
about
to
call
him
*NL*
back
to
the
point
,
but
Van
Helsing
whispered
to
me
:
``
Let
him
go
on
.
Do
*NL*
not
interrupt
him
;
he
can
not
go
back
,
and
maybe
could
not
proceed
at
all
*NL*
if
once
he
lost
the
thread
of
his
thought
.
''
He
proceeded
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
day
I
waited
to
hear
from
him
,
but
he
did
not
send
me
anything
,
not
*NL*
even
a
blow-fly
,
and
when
the
moon
got
up
I
was
pretty
angry
with
him
.
*NL*
When
he
slid
in
through
the
window
,
though
it
was
shut
,
and
did
not
even
*NL*
knock
,
I
got
mad
with
him
.
He
sneered
at
me
,
and
his
white
face
looked
*NL*
out
of
the
mist
with
his
red
eyes
gleaming
,
and
he
went
on
as
though
he
*NL*
owned
the
whole
place
,
and
I
was
no
one
.
He
did
n't
even
smell
the
same
*NL*
as
he
went
by
me
.
I
could
n't
hold
him
.
I
thought
that
,
somehow
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Harker
had
come
into
the
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
sitting
on
the
bed
stood
up
and
came
over
,
standing
behind
*NL*
him
so
that
he
could
not
see
them
,
but
where
they
could
hear
better
.
*NL*
They
were
both
silent
,
but
the
Professor
started
and
quivered
;
his
face
,
*NL*
however
,
grew
grimmer
and
sterner
still
.
Renfield
went
on
without
*NL*
noticing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Mrs.
Harker
came
in
to
see
me
this
afternoon
she
was
n't
the
same
;
*NL*
it
was
like
tea
after
the
teapot
had
been
watered
.
''
Here
we
all
moved
,
*NL*
but
no
one
said
a
word
;
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
that
she
was
here
till
she
spoke
;
and
she
did
n't
look
the
*NL*
same
.
I
do
n't
care
for
the
pale
people
;
I
like
them
with
lots
of
blood
*NL*
in
them
,
and
hers
had
all
seemed
to
have
run
out
.
I
did
n't
think
of
it
*NL*
at
the
time
;
but
when
she
went
away
I
began
to
think
,
and
it
made
me
mad
*NL*
to
know
that
He
had
been
taking
the
life
out
of
her
.
''
I
could
feel
that
*NL*
the
rest
quivered
,
as
I
did
,
but
we
remained
otherwise
still
.
``
So
when
*NL*
He
came
to-night
I
was
ready
for
Him
.
I
saw
the
mist
stealing
in
,
and
I
*NL*
grabbed
it
tight
.
I
had
heard
that
madmen
have
unnatural
strength
;
and
*NL*
as
I
knew
I
was
a
madman
--
at
times
anyhow
--
I
resolved
to
use
my
power
.
*NL*
Ay
,
and
He
felt
it
too
,
for
He
had
to
come
out
of
the
mist
to
struggle
*NL*
with
me
.
I
held
tight
;
and
I
thought
I
was
going
to
win
,
for
I
did
n't
*NL*
mean
Him
to
take
any
more
of
her
life
,
till
I
saw
His
eyes
.
They
burned
*NL*
into
me
,
and
my
strength
became
like
water
.
He
slipped
through
it
,
and
*NL*
when
I
tried
to
cling
to
Him
,
He
raised
me
up
and
flung
me
down
.
There
*NL*
was
a
red
cloud
before
me
,
and
a
noise
like
thunder
,
and
the
mist
seemed
*NL*
to
steal
away
under
the
door
.
''
His
voice
was
becoming
fainter
and
his
*NL*
breath
more
stertorous
.
Van
Helsing
stood
up
instinctively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
know
the
worst
now
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
is
here
,
and
we
know
his
purpose
.
*NL*
It
may
not
be
too
late
.
Let
us
be
armed
--
the
same
as
we
were
the
other
*NL*
night
,
but
lose
no
time
;
there
is
not
an
instant
to
spare
.
''
There
was
no
*NL*
need
to
put
our
fear
,
nay
our
conviction
,
into
words
--
we
shared
them
in
*NL*
common
.
We
all
hurried
and
took
from
our
rooms
the
same
things
that
we
*NL*
had
when
we
entered
the
Count
's
house
.
The
Professor
had
his
ready
,
and
*NL*
as
we
met
in
the
corridor
he
pointed
to
them
significantly
as
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
never
leave
me
;
and
they
shall
not
till
this
unhappy
business
is
*NL*
over
.
Be
wise
also
,
my
friends
.
It
is
no
common
enemy
that
we
deal
with
.
*NL*
Alas
!
alas
!
that
that
dear
Madam
Mina
should
suffer
!
''
He
stopped
;
his
*NL*
voice
was
breaking
,
and
I
do
not
know
if
rage
or
terror
predominated
in
*NL*
my
own
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
Harkers
'
door
we
paused
.
Art
and
Quincey
held
back
,
and
the
*NL*
latter
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
we
disturb
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
,
''
said
Van
Helsing
grimly
.
``
If
the
door
be
locked
,
I
shall
*NL*
break
it
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
it
not
frighten
her
terribly
?
It
is
unusual
to
break
into
a
lady
's
*NL*
room
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
said
solemnly
,
``
You
are
always
right
;
but
this
is
life
and
*NL*
death
.
All
chambers
are
alike
to
the
doctor
;
and
even
were
they
not
they
*NL*
are
all
as
one
to
me
to-night
.
Friend
John
,
when
I
turn
the
handle
,
if
*NL*
the
door
does
not
open
,
do
you
put
your
shoulder
down
and
shove
;
and
you
*NL*
too
,
my
friends
.
Now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
the
handle
as
he
spoke
,
but
the
door
did
not
yield
.
We
threw
*NL*
ourselves
against
it
;
with
a
crash
it
burst
open
,
and
we
almost
fell
*NL*
headlong
into
the
room
.
The
Professor
did
actually
fall
,
and
I
saw
*NL*
across
him
as
he
gathered
himself
up
from
hands
and
knees
.
What
I
saw
*NL*
appalled
me
.
I
felt
my
hair
rise
like
bristles
on
the
back
of
my
neck
,
*NL*
and
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moonlight
was
so
bright
that
through
the
thick
yellow
blind
the
room
*NL*
was
light
enough
to
see
.
On
the
bed
beside
the
window
lay
Jonathan
*NL*
Harker
,
his
face
flushed
and
breathing
heavily
as
though
in
a
stupor
.
*NL*
Kneeling
on
the
near
edge
of
the
bed
facing
outwards
was
the
white-clad
*NL*
figure
of
his
wife
.
By
her
side
stood
a
tall
,
thin
man
,
clad
in
black
.
*NL*
His
face
was
turned
from
us
,
but
the
instant
we
saw
we
all
recognised
*NL*
the
Count
--
in
every
way
,
even
to
the
scar
on
his
forehead
.
With
his
left
*NL*
hand
he
held
both
Mrs.
Harker
's
hands
,
keeping
them
away
with
her
arms
*NL*
at
full
tension
;
his
right
hand
gripped
her
by
the
back
of
the
neck
,
*NL*
forcing
her
face
down
on
his
bosom
.
Her
white
nightdress
was
smeared
*NL*
with
blood
,
and
a
thin
stream
trickled
down
the
man
's
bare
breast
which
*NL*
was
shown
by
his
torn-open
dress
.
The
attitude
of
the
two
had
a
terrible
*NL*
resemblance
to
a
child
forcing
a
kitten
's
nose
into
a
saucer
of
milk
to
*NL*
compel
it
to
drink
.
As
we
burst
into
the
room
,
the
Count
turned
his
*NL*
face
,
and
the
hellish
look
that
I
had
heard
described
seemed
to
leap
*NL*
into
it
.
His
eyes
flamed
red
with
devilish
passion
;
the
great
nostrils
*NL*
of
the
white
aquiline
nose
opened
wide
and
quivered
at
the
edge
;
and
the
*NL*
white
sharp
teeth
,
behind
the
full
lips
of
the
blood-dripping
mouth
,
*NL*
champed
together
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
.
With
a
wrench
,
which
threw
*NL*
his
victim
back
upon
the
bed
as
though
hurled
from
a
height
,
he
turned
*NL*
and
sprang
at
us
.
But
by
this
time
the
Professor
had
gained
his
feet
,
*NL*
and
was
holding
towards
him
the
envelope
which
contained
the
Sacred
*NL*
Wafer
.
The
Count
suddenly
stopped
,
just
as
poor
Lucy
had
done
outside
*NL*
the
tomb
,
and
cowered
back
.
Further
and
further
back
he
cowered
,
as
we
,
*NL*
lifting
our
crucifixes
,
advanced
.
The
moonlight
suddenly
failed
,
as
a
*NL*
great
black
cloud
sailed
across
the
sky
;
and
when
the
gaslight
sprang
up
*NL*
under
Quincey
's
match
,
we
saw
nothing
but
a
faint
vapour
.
This
,
as
we
*NL*
looked
,
trailed
under
the
door
,
which
with
the
recoil
from
its
bursting
*NL*
open
,
had
swung
back
to
its
old
position
.
Van
Helsing
,
Art
,
and
I
moved
*NL*
forward
to
Mrs.
Harker
,
who
by
this
time
had
drawn
her
breath
and
with
*NL*
it
had
given
a
scream
so
wild
,
so
ear-piercing
,
so
despairing
that
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
now
that
it
will
ring
in
my
ears
till
my
dying
day
.
For
a
*NL*
few
seconds
she
lay
in
her
helpless
attitude
and
disarray
.
Her
face
was
*NL*
ghastly
,
with
a
pallor
which
was
accentuated
by
the
blood
which
smeared
*NL*
her
lips
and
cheeks
and
chin
;
from
her
throat
trickled
a
thin
stream
of
*NL*
blood
;
her
eyes
were
mad
with
terror
.
Then
she
put
before
her
face
her
*NL*
poor
crushed
hands
,
which
bore
on
their
whiteness
the
red
mark
of
the
*NL*
Count
's
terrible
grip
,
and
from
behind
them
came
a
low
desolate
wail
*NL*
which
made
the
terrible
scream
seem
only
the
quick
expression
of
an
*NL*
endless
grief
.
Van
Helsing
stepped
forward
and
drew
the
coverlet
gently
*NL*
over
her
body
,
whilst
Art
,
after
looking
at
her
face
for
an
instant
*NL*
despairingly
,
ran
out
of
the
room
.
Van
Helsing
whispered
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jonathan
is
in
a
stupor
such
as
we
know
the
Vampire
can
produce
.
We
can
*NL*
do
nothing
with
poor
Madam
Mina
for
a
few
moments
till
she
recovers
*NL*
herself
;
I
must
wake
him
!
''
He
dipped
the
end
of
a
towel
in
cold
water
*NL*
and
with
it
began
to
flick
him
on
the
face
,
his
wife
all
the
while
*NL*
holding
her
face
between
her
hands
and
sobbing
in
a
way
that
was
*NL*
heart-breaking
to
hear
.
I
raised
the
blind
,
and
looked
out
of
the
*NL*
window
.
There
was
much
moonshine
;
and
as
I
looked
I
could
see
Quincey
*NL*
Morris
run
across
the
lawn
and
hide
himself
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
*NL*
yew-tree
.
It
puzzled
me
to
think
why
he
was
doing
this
;
but
at
the
*NL*
instant
I
heard
Harker
's
quick
exclamation
as
he
woke
to
partial
*NL*
consciousness
,
and
turned
to
the
bed
.
On
his
face
,
as
there
might
well
*NL*
be
,
was
a
look
of
wild
amazement
.
He
seemed
dazed
for
a
few
seconds
,
and
*NL*
then
full
consciousness
seemed
to
burst
upon
him
all
at
once
,
and
he
*NL*
started
up
.
His
wife
was
aroused
by
the
quick
movement
,
and
turned
to
*NL*
him
with
her
arms
stretched
out
,
as
though
to
embrace
him
;
instantly
,
*NL*
however
,
she
drew
them
in
again
,
and
putting
her
elbows
together
,
held
*NL*
her
hands
before
her
face
,
and
shuddered
till
the
bed
beneath
her
shook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
God
's
name
what
does
this
mean
?
''
Harker
cried
out
.
``
Dr.
Seward
,
Dr.
*NL*
Van
Helsing
,
what
is
it
?
What
has
happened
?
What
is
wrong
?
Mina
,
dear
,
*NL*
what
is
it
?
What
does
that
blood
mean
?
My
God
,
my
God
!
has
it
come
to
*NL*
this
!
''
and
,
raising
himself
to
his
knees
,
he
beat
his
hands
wildly
*NL*
together
.
``
Good
God
help
us
!
help
her
!
oh
,
help
her
!
''
With
a
quick
*NL*
movement
he
jumped
from
bed
,
and
began
to
pull
on
his
clothes
,
--
all
the
*NL*
man
in
him
awake
at
the
need
for
instant
exertion
.
``
What
has
happened
?
*NL*
Tell
me
all
about
it
!
''
he
cried
without
pausing
.
``
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
you
*NL*
love
Mina
,
I
know
.
Oh
,
do
something
to
save
her
.
It
can
not
have
gone
too
*NL*
far
yet
.
Guard
her
while
I
look
for
_
him
_
!
''
His
wife
,
through
her
terror
*NL*
and
horror
and
distress
,
saw
some
sure
danger
to
him
:
instantly
*NL*
forgetting
her
own
grief
,
she
seized
hold
of
him
and
cried
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
no
!
Jonathan
,
you
must
not
leave
me
.
I
have
suffered
enough
*NL*
to-night
,
God
knows
,
without
the
dread
of
his
harming
you
.
You
must
stay
*NL*
with
me
.
Stay
with
these
friends
who
will
watch
over
you
!
''
Her
*NL*
expression
became
frantic
as
she
spoke
;
and
,
he
yielding
to
her
,
she
*NL*
pulled
him
down
sitting
on
the
bed
side
,
and
clung
to
him
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
and
I
tried
to
calm
them
both
.
The
Professor
held
up
his
*NL*
little
golden
crucifix
,
and
said
with
wonderful
calmness
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
fear
,
my
dear
.
We
are
here
;
and
whilst
this
is
close
to
you
no
*NL*
foul
thing
can
approach
.
You
are
safe
for
to-night
;
and
we
must
be
calm
*NL*
and
take
counsel
together
.
''
She
shuddered
and
was
silent
,
holding
down
*NL*
her
head
on
her
husband
's
breast
.
When
she
raised
it
,
his
white
*NL*
night-robe
was
stained
with
blood
where
her
lips
had
touched
,
and
where
*NL*
the
thin
open
wound
in
her
neck
had
sent
forth
drops
.
The
instant
she
*NL*
saw
it
she
drew
back
,
with
a
low
wail
,
and
whispered
,
amidst
choking
*NL*
sobs
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unclean
,
unclean
!
I
must
touch
him
or
kiss
him
no
more
.
Oh
,
that
it
*NL*
should
be
that
it
is
I
who
am
now
his
worst
enemy
,
and
whom
he
may
have
*NL*
most
cause
to
fear
.
''
To
this
he
spoke
out
resolutely
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
Mina
.
It
is
a
shame
to
me
to
hear
such
a
word
.
I
would
not
*NL*
hear
it
of
you
;
and
I
shall
not
hear
it
from
you
.
May
God
judge
me
by
my
*NL*
deserts
,
and
punish
me
with
more
bitter
suffering
than
even
this
hour
,
*NL*
if
by
any
act
or
will
of
mine
anything
ever
come
between
us
!
''
He
put
out
*NL*
his
arms
and
folded
her
to
his
breast
;
and
for
a
while
she
lay
there
*NL*
sobbing
.
He
looked
at
us
over
her
bowed
head
,
with
eyes
that
blinked
*NL*
damply
above
his
quivering
nostrils
;
his
mouth
was
set
as
steel
.
After
a
*NL*
while
her
sobs
became
less
frequent
and
more
faint
,
and
then
he
said
to
*NL*
me
,
speaking
with
a
studied
calmness
which
I
felt
tried
his
nervous
*NL*
power
to
the
utmost
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Dr.
Seward
,
tell
me
all
about
it
.
Too
well
I
know
the
broad
*NL*
fact
;
tell
me
all
that
has
been
.
''
I
told
him
exactly
what
had
happened
,
*NL*
and
he
listened
with
seeming
impassiveness
;
but
his
nostrils
twitched
*NL*
and
his
eyes
blazed
as
I
told
how
the
ruthless
hands
of
the
Count
had
*NL*
held
his
wife
in
that
terrible
and
horrid
position
,
with
her
mouth
to
*NL*
the
open
wound
in
his
breast
.
It
interested
me
,
even
at
that
moment
,
to
*NL*
see
,
that
,
whilst
the
face
of
white
set
passion
worked
convulsively
over
*NL*
the
bowed
head
,
the
hands
tenderly
and
lovingly
stroked
the
ruffled
*NL*
hair
.
Just
as
I
had
finished
,
Quincey
and
Godalming
knocked
at
the
door
.
*NL*
They
entered
in
obedience
to
our
summons
.
Van
Helsing
looked
at
me
*NL*
questioningly
.
I
understood
him
to
mean
if
we
were
to
take
advantage
of
*NL*
their
coming
to
divert
if
possible
the
thoughts
of
the
unhappy
husband
*NL*
and
wife
from
each
other
and
from
themselves
;
so
on
nodding
acquiescence
*NL*
to
him
he
asked
them
what
they
had
seen
or
done
.
To
which
Lord
Godalming
*NL*
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
see
him
anywhere
in
the
passage
,
or
in
any
of
our
rooms
.
I
*NL*
looked
in
the
study
but
,
though
he
had
been
there
,
he
had
gone
.
He
had
,
*NL*
however
--
''
He
stopped
suddenly
,
looking
at
the
poor
drooping
figure
on
*NL*
the
bed
.
Van
Helsing
said
gravely
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
friend
Arthur
.
We
want
here
no
more
concealments
.
Our
hope
now
*NL*
is
in
knowing
all
.
Tell
freely
!
''
So
Art
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
been
there
,
and
though
it
could
only
have
been
for
a
few
*NL*
seconds
,
he
made
rare
hay
of
the
place
.
All
the
manuscript
had
been
*NL*
burned
,
and
the
blue
flames
were
flickering
amongst
the
white
ashes
;
the
*NL*
cylinders
of
your
phonograph
too
were
thrown
on
the
fire
,
and
the
wax
*NL*
had
helped
the
flames
.
''
Here
I
interrupted
.
``
Thank
God
there
is
the
*NL*
other
copy
in
the
safe
!
''
His
face
lit
for
a
moment
,
but
fell
again
as
he
*NL*
went
on
:
``
I
ran
downstairs
then
,
but
could
see
no
sign
of
him
.
I
looked
*NL*
into
Renfield
's
room
;
but
there
was
no
trace
there
except
--
!
''
Again
he
*NL*
paused
.
``
Go
on
,
''
said
Harker
hoarsely
;
so
he
bowed
his
head
and
*NL*
moistening
his
lips
with
his
tongue
,
added
:
``
except
that
the
poor
fellow
*NL*
is
dead
.
''
Mrs.
Harker
raised
her
head
,
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
*NL*
us
she
said
solemnly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
's
will
be
done
!
''
I
could
not
but
feel
that
Art
was
keeping
back
*NL*
something
;
but
,
as
I
took
it
that
it
was
with
a
purpose
,
I
said
nothing
.
*NL*
Van
Helsing
turned
to
Morris
and
asked
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
friend
Quincey
,
have
you
any
to
tell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
,
''
he
answered
.
``
It
may
be
much
eventually
,
but
at
present
I
*NL*
ca
n't
say
.
I
thought
it
well
to
know
if
possible
where
the
Count
would
*NL*
go
when
he
left
the
house
.
I
did
not
see
him
;
but
I
saw
a
bat
rise
from
*NL*
Renfield
's
window
,
and
flap
westward
.
I
expected
to
see
him
in
some
*NL*
shape
go
back
to
Carfax
;
but
he
evidently
sought
some
other
lair
.
He
*NL*
will
not
be
back
to-night
;
for
the
sky
is
reddening
in
the
east
,
and
the
*NL*
dawn
is
close
.
We
must
work
to-morrow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
the
latter
words
through
his
shut
teeth
.
For
a
space
of
perhaps
*NL*
a
couple
of
minutes
there
was
silence
,
and
I
could
fancy
that
I
could
*NL*
hear
the
sound
of
our
hearts
beating
;
then
Van
Helsing
said
,
placing
his
*NL*
hand
very
tenderly
on
Mrs.
Harker
's
head
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Madam
Mina
--
poor
,
dear
,
dear
Madam
Mina
--
tell
us
exactly
what
*NL*
happened
.
God
knows
that
I
do
not
want
that
you
be
pained
;
but
it
is
*NL*
need
that
we
know
all
.
For
now
more
than
ever
has
all
work
to
be
done
*NL*
quick
and
sharp
,
and
in
deadly
earnest
.
The
day
is
close
to
us
that
must
*NL*
end
all
,
if
it
may
be
so
;
and
now
is
the
chance
that
we
may
live
and
*NL*
learn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
,
dear
lady
shivered
,
and
I
could
see
the
tension
of
her
nerves
*NL*
as
she
clasped
her
husband
closer
to
her
and
bent
her
head
lower
and
*NL*
lower
still
on
his
breast
.
Then
she
raised
her
head
proudly
,
and
held
*NL*
out
one
hand
to
Van
Helsing
who
took
it
in
his
,
and
,
after
stooping
and
*NL*
kissing
it
reverently
,
held
it
fast
.
The
other
hand
was
locked
in
that
*NL*
of
her
husband
,
who
held
his
other
arm
thrown
round
her
protectingly
.
*NL*
After
a
pause
in
which
she
was
evidently
ordering
her
thoughts
,
she
*NL*
began
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
the
sleeping
draught
which
you
had
so
kindly
given
me
,
but
for
a
*NL*
long
time
it
did
not
act
.
I
seemed
to
become
more
wakeful
,
and
myriads
*NL*
of
horrible
fancies
began
to
crowd
in
upon
my
mind
--
all
of
them
*NL*
connected
with
death
,
and
vampires
;
with
blood
,
and
pain
,
and
trouble
.
''
*NL*
Her
husband
involuntarily
groaned
as
she
turned
to
him
and
said
*NL*
lovingly
:
``
Do
not
fret
,
dear
.
You
must
be
brave
and
strong
,
and
help
me
*NL*
through
the
horrible
task
.
If
you
only
knew
what
an
effort
it
is
to
me
*NL*
to
tell
of
this
fearful
thing
at
all
,
you
would
understand
how
much
I
*NL*
need
your
help
.
Well
,
I
saw
I
must
try
to
help
the
medicine
to
its
work
*NL*
with
my
will
,
if
it
was
to
do
me
any
good
,
so
I
resolutely
set
myself
to
*NL*
sleep
.
Sure
enough
sleep
must
soon
have
come
to
me
,
for
I
remember
no
*NL*
more
.
Jonathan
coming
in
had
not
waked
me
,
for
he
lay
by
my
side
when
*NL*
next
I
remember
.
There
was
in
the
room
the
same
thin
white
mist
that
I
*NL*
had
before
noticed
.
But
I
forget
now
if
you
know
of
this
;
you
will
find
*NL*
it
in
my
diary
which
I
shall
show
you
later
.
I
felt
the
same
vague
*NL*
terror
which
had
come
to
me
before
and
the
same
sense
of
some
presence
.
*NL*
I
turned
to
wake
Jonathan
,
but
found
that
he
slept
so
soundly
that
it
*NL*
seemed
as
if
it
was
he
who
had
taken
the
sleeping
draught
,
and
not
I.
I
*NL*
tried
,
but
I
could
not
wake
him
.
This
caused
me
a
great
fear
,
and
I
*NL*
looked
around
terrified
.
Then
indeed
,
my
heart
sank
within
me
:
beside
*NL*
the
bed
,
as
if
he
had
stepped
out
of
the
mist
--
or
rather
as
if
the
mist
*NL*
had
turned
into
his
figure
,
for
it
had
entirely
disappeared
--
stood
a
*NL*
tall
,
thin
man
,
all
in
black
.
I
knew
him
at
once
from
the
description
of
*NL*
the
others
.
The
waxen
face
;
the
high
aquiline
nose
,
on
which
the
light
*NL*
fell
in
a
thin
white
line
;
the
parted
red
lips
,
with
the
sharp
white
*NL*
teeth
showing
between
;
and
the
red
eyes
that
I
had
seemed
to
see
in
the
*NL*
sunset
on
the
windows
of
St.
Mary
's
Church
at
Whitby
.
I
knew
,
too
,
the
*NL*
red
scar
on
his
forehead
where
Jonathan
had
struck
him
.
For
an
instant
*NL*
my
heart
stood
still
,
and
I
would
have
screamed
out
,
only
that
I
was
*NL*
paralysed
.
In
the
pause
he
spoke
in
a
sort
of
keen
,
cutting
whisper
,
*NL*
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
Jonathan
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Silence
!
If
you
make
a
sound
I
shall
take
him
and
dash
his
brains
out
*NL*
before
your
very
eyes
.
'
I
was
appalled
and
was
too
bewildered
to
do
or
*NL*
say
anything
.
With
a
mocking
smile
,
he
placed
one
hand
upon
my
shoulder
*NL*
and
,
holding
me
tight
,
bared
my
throat
with
the
other
,
saying
as
he
did
*NL*
so
,
`
First
,
a
little
refreshment
to
reward
my
exertions
.
You
may
as
well
*NL*
be
quiet
;
it
is
not
the
first
time
,
or
the
second
,
that
your
veins
have
*NL*
appeased
my
thirst
!
'
I
was
bewildered
,
and
,
strangely
enough
,
I
did
not
*NL*
want
to
hinder
him
.
I
suppose
it
is
a
part
of
the
horrible
curse
that
*NL*
such
is
,
when
his
touch
is
on
his
victim
.
And
oh
,
my
God
,
my
God
,
pity
*NL*
me
!
He
placed
his
reeking
lips
upon
my
throat
!
''
Her
husband
groaned
*NL*
again
.
She
clasped
his
hand
harder
,
and
looked
at
him
pityingly
,
as
if
*NL*
he
were
the
injured
one
,
and
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
my
strength
fading
away
,
and
I
was
in
a
half
swoon
.
How
long
*NL*
this
horrible
thing
lasted
I
know
not
;
but
it
seemed
that
a
long
time
*NL*
must
have
passed
before
he
took
his
foul
,
awful
,
sneering
mouth
away
.
I
*NL*
saw
it
drip
with
the
fresh
blood
!
''
The
remembrance
seemed
for
a
while
to
*NL*
overpower
her
,
and
she
drooped
and
would
have
sunk
down
but
for
her
*NL*
husband
's
sustaining
arm
.
With
a
great
effort
she
recovered
herself
and
*NL*
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
spoke
to
me
mockingly
,
`
And
so
you
,
like
the
others
,
would
play
*NL*
your
brains
against
mine
.
You
would
help
these
men
to
hunt
me
and
*NL*
frustrate
me
in
my
designs
!
You
know
now
,
and
they
know
in
part
already
,
*NL*
and
will
know
in
full
before
long
,
what
it
is
to
cross
my
path
.
They
*NL*
should
have
kept
their
energies
for
use
closer
to
home
.
Whilst
they
*NL*
played
wits
against
me
--
against
me
who
commanded
nations
,
and
intrigued
*NL*
for
them
,
and
fought
for
them
,
hundreds
of
years
before
they
were
*NL*
born
--
I
was
countermining
them
.
And
you
,
their
best
beloved
one
,
are
now
*NL*
to
me
,
flesh
of
my
flesh
;
blood
of
my
blood
;
kin
of
my
kin
;
my
bountiful
*NL*
wine-press
for
a
while
;
and
shall
be
later
on
my
companion
and
my
*NL*
helper
.
You
shall
be
avenged
in
turn
;
for
not
one
of
them
but
shall
*NL*
minister
to
your
needs
.
But
as
yet
you
are
to
be
punished
for
what
you
*NL*
have
done
.
You
have
aided
in
thwarting
me
;
now
you
shall
come
to
my
*NL*
call
.
When
my
brain
says
``
Come
!
''
to
you
,
you
shall
cross
land
or
sea
to
*NL*
do
my
bidding
;
and
to
that
end
this
!
'
With
that
he
pulled
open
his
*NL*
shirt
,
and
with
his
long
sharp
nails
opened
a
vein
in
his
breast
.
When
*NL*
the
blood
began
to
spurt
out
,
he
took
my
hands
in
one
of
his
,
holding
*NL*
them
tight
,
and
with
the
other
seized
my
neck
and
pressed
my
mouth
to
*NL*
the
wound
,
so
that
I
must
either
suffocate
or
swallow
some
of
the
--
Oh
*NL*
my
God
!
my
God
!
what
have
I
done
?
What
have
I
done
to
deserve
such
a
*NL*
fate
,
I
who
have
tried
to
walk
in
meekness
and
righteousness
all
my
*NL*
days
.
God
pity
me
!
Look
down
on
a
poor
soul
in
worse
than
mortal
peril
;
*NL*
and
in
mercy
pity
those
to
whom
she
is
dear
!
''
Then
she
began
to
rub
her
*NL*
lips
as
though
to
cleanse
them
from
pollution
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
telling
her
terrible
story
,
the
eastern
sky
began
to
quicken
,
*NL*
and
everything
became
more
and
more
clear
.
Harker
was
still
and
quiet
;
*NL*
but
over
his
face
,
as
the
awful
narrative
went
on
,
came
a
grey
look
*NL*
which
deepened
and
deepened
in
the
morning
light
,
till
when
the
first
*NL*
red
streak
of
the
coming
dawn
shot
up
,
the
flesh
stood
darkly
out
*NL*
against
the
whitening
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
arranged
that
one
of
us
is
to
stay
within
call
of
the
unhappy
*NL*
pair
till
we
can
meet
together
and
arrange
about
taking
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
I
am
sure
:
the
sun
rises
to-day
on
no
more
miserable
house
in
*NL*
all
the
great
round
of
its
daily
course
.

JONATHAN
HARKER
'S
JOURNAL

*NL*
_
3
October
.
_
--
As
I
must
do
something
or
go
mad
,
I
write
this
diary
.
It
*NL*
is
now
six
o'clock
,
and
we
are
to
meet
in
the
study
in
half
an
hour
and
*NL*
take
something
to
eat
;
for
Dr.
Van
Helsing
and
Dr.
Seward
are
agreed
*NL*
that
if
we
do
not
eat
we
can
not
work
our
best
.
Our
best
will
be
,
God
*NL*
knows
,
required
to-day
.
I
must
keep
writing
at
every
chance
,
for
I
dare
*NL*
not
stop
to
think
.
All
,
big
and
little
,
must
go
down
;
perhaps
at
the
end
*NL*
the
little
things
may
teach
us
most
.
The
teaching
,
big
or
little
,
could
*NL*
not
have
landed
Mina
or
me
anywhere
worse
than
we
are
to-day
.
However
,
*NL*
we
must
trust
and
hope
.
Poor
Mina
told
me
just
now
,
with
the
tears
*NL*
running
down
her
dear
cheeks
,
that
it
is
in
trouble
and
trial
that
our
*NL*
faith
is
tested
--
that
we
must
keep
on
trusting
;
and
that
God
will
aid
us
*NL*
up
to
the
end
.
The
end
!
oh
my
God
!
what
end
?
...
To
work
!
To
work
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dr.
Van
Helsing
and
Dr.
Seward
had
come
back
from
seeing
poor
*NL*
Renfield
,
we
went
gravely
into
what
was
to
be
done
.
First
,
Dr.
Seward
*NL*
told
us
that
when
he
and
Dr.
Van
Helsing
had
gone
down
to
the
room
below
*NL*
they
had
found
Renfield
lying
on
the
floor
,
all
in
a
heap
.
His
face
was
*NL*
all
bruised
and
crushed
in
,
and
the
bones
of
the
neck
were
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Seward
asked
the
attendant
who
was
on
duty
in
the
passage
if
he
had
*NL*
heard
anything
.
He
said
that
he
had
been
sitting
down
--
he
confessed
to
*NL*
half
dozing
--
when
he
heard
loud
voices
in
the
room
,
and
then
Renfield
*NL*
had
called
out
loudly
several
times
,
``
God
!
God
!
God
!
''
after
that
there
*NL*
was
a
sound
of
falling
,
and
when
he
entered
the
room
he
found
him
lying
*NL*
on
the
floor
,
face
down
,
just
as
the
doctors
had
seen
him
.
Van
Helsing
*NL*
asked
if
he
had
heard
``
voices
''
or
``
a
voice
,
''
and
he
said
he
could
not
*NL*
say
;
that
at
first
it
had
seemed
to
him
as
if
there
were
two
,
but
as
*NL*
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
it
could
have
been
only
one
.
He
could
swear
*NL*
to
it
,
if
required
,
that
the
word
``
God
''
was
spoken
by
the
patient
.
Dr.
*NL*
Seward
said
to
us
,
when
we
were
alone
,
that
he
did
not
wish
to
go
into
*NL*
the
matter
;
the
question
of
an
inquest
had
to
be
considered
,
and
it
*NL*
would
never
do
to
put
forward
the
truth
,
as
no
one
would
believe
it
.
As
*NL*
it
was
,
he
thought
that
on
the
attendant
's
evidence
he
could
give
a
*NL*
certificate
of
death
by
misadventure
in
falling
from
bed
.
In
case
the
*NL*
coroner
should
demand
it
,
there
would
be
a
formal
inquest
,
necessarily
*NL*
to
the
same
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
question
began
to
be
discussed
as
to
what
should
be
our
next
*NL*
step
,
the
very
first
thing
we
decided
was
that
Mina
should
be
in
full
*NL*
confidence
;
that
nothing
of
any
sort
--
no
matter
how
painful
--
should
be
*NL*
kept
from
her
.
She
herself
agreed
as
to
its
wisdom
,
and
it
was
pitiful
*NL*
to
see
her
so
brave
and
yet
so
sorrowful
,
and
in
such
a
depth
of
*NL*
despair
.
``
There
must
be
no
concealment
,
''
she
said
,
``
Alas
!
we
have
had
*NL*
too
much
already
.
And
besides
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
world
that
can
*NL*
give
me
more
pain
than
I
have
already
endured
--
than
I
suffer
now
!
*NL*
Whatever
may
happen
,
it
must
be
of
new
hope
or
of
new
courage
to
me
!
''
*NL*
Van
Helsing
was
looking
at
her
fixedly
as
she
spoke
,
and
said
,
suddenly
*NL*
but
quietly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
dear
Madam
Mina
,
are
you
not
afraid
;
not
for
yourself
,
but
for
*NL*
others
from
yourself
,
after
what
has
happened
?
''
Her
face
grew
set
in
its
*NL*
lines
,
but
her
eyes
shone
with
the
devotion
of
a
martyr
as
she
*NL*
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no
!
for
my
mind
is
made
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
what
?
''
he
asked
gently
,
whilst
we
were
all
very
still
;
for
each
in
*NL*
our
own
way
we
had
a
sort
of
vague
idea
of
what
she
meant
.
Her
answer
*NL*
came
with
direct
simplicity
,
as
though
she
were
simply
stating
a
fact
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
if
I
find
in
myself
--
and
I
shall
watch
keenly
for
it
--
a
sign
of
*NL*
harm
to
any
that
I
love
,
I
shall
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not
kill
yourself
?
''
he
asked
,
hoarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
;
if
there
were
no
friend
who
loved
me
,
who
would
save
me
such
a
*NL*
pain
,
and
so
desperate
an
effort
!
''
She
looked
at
him
meaningly
as
she
*NL*
spoke
.
He
was
sitting
down
;
but
now
he
rose
and
came
close
to
her
and
*NL*
put
his
hand
on
her
head
as
he
said
solemnly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
there
is
such
an
one
if
it
were
for
your
good
.
For
myself
I
*NL*
could
hold
it
in
my
account
with
God
to
find
such
an
euthanasia
for
you
,
*NL*
even
at
this
moment
if
it
were
best
.
Nay
,
were
it
safe
!
But
my
*NL*
child
--
''
For
a
moment
he
seemed
choked
,
and
a
great
sob
rose
in
his
*NL*
throat
;
he
gulped
it
down
and
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
here
some
who
would
stand
between
you
and
death
.
You
must
not
*NL*
die
.
You
must
not
die
by
any
hand
;
but
least
of
all
by
your
own
.
Until
*NL*
the
other
,
who
has
fouled
your
sweet
life
,
is
true
dead
you
must
not
*NL*
die
;
for
if
he
is
still
with
the
quick
Un-Dead
,
your
death
would
make
*NL*
you
even
as
he
is
.
No
,
you
must
live
!
You
must
struggle
and
strive
to
*NL*
live
,
though
death
would
seem
a
boon
unspeakable
.
You
must
fight
Death
*NL*
himself
,
though
he
come
to
you
in
pain
or
in
joy
;
by
the
day
,
or
the
*NL*
night
;
in
safety
or
in
peril
!
On
your
living
soul
I
charge
you
that
you
*NL*
do
not
die
--
nay
,
nor
think
of
death
--
till
this
great
evil
be
past
.
''
The
*NL*
poor
dear
grew
white
as
death
,
and
shock
and
shivered
,
as
I
have
seen
a
*NL*
quicksand
shake
and
shiver
at
the
incoming
of
the
tide
.
We
were
all
*NL*
silent
;
we
could
do
nothing
.
At
length
she
grew
more
calm
and
turning
to
*NL*
him
said
,
sweetly
,
but
oh
!
so
sorrowfully
,
as
she
held
out
her
hand
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
you
,
my
dear
friend
,
that
if
God
will
let
me
live
,
I
shall
*NL*
strive
to
do
so
;
till
,
if
it
may
be
in
His
good
time
,
this
horror
may
*NL*
have
passed
away
from
me
.
''
She
was
so
good
and
brave
that
we
all
felt
*NL*
that
our
hearts
were
strengthened
to
work
and
endure
for
her
,
and
we
*NL*
began
to
discuss
what
we
were
to
do
.
I
told
her
that
she
was
to
have
all
*NL*
the
papers
in
the
safe
,
and
all
the
papers
or
diaries
and
phonographs
we
*NL*
might
hereafter
use
;
and
was
to
keep
the
record
as
she
had
done
before
.
*NL*
She
was
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
anything
to
do
--
if
``
pleased
''
could
*NL*
be
used
in
connection
with
so
grim
an
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
usual
Van
Helsing
had
thought
ahead
of
everyone
else
,
and
was
*NL*
prepared
with
an
exact
ordering
of
our
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
perhaps
well
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
at
our
meeting
after
our
visit
to
*NL*
Carfax
we
decided
not
to
do
anything
with
the
earth-boxes
that
lay
*NL*
there
.
Had
we
done
so
,
the
Count
must
have
guessed
our
purpose
,
and
*NL*
would
doubtless
have
taken
measures
in
advance
to
frustrate
such
an
*NL*
effort
with
regard
to
the
others
;
but
now
he
does
not
know
our
*NL*
intentions
.
Nay
,
more
,
in
all
probability
,
he
does
not
know
that
such
a
*NL*
power
exists
to
us
as
can
sterilise
his
lairs
,
so
that
he
can
not
use
*NL*
them
as
of
old
.
We
are
now
so
much
further
advanced
in
our
knowledge
as
*NL*
to
their
disposition
that
,
when
we
have
examined
the
house
in
*NL*
Piccadilly
,
we
may
track
the
very
last
of
them
.
To-day
,
then
,
is
ours
;
*NL*
and
in
it
rests
our
hope
.
The
sun
that
rose
on
our
sorrow
this
morning
*NL*
guards
us
in
its
course
.
Until
it
sets
to-night
,
that
monster
must
*NL*
retain
whatever
form
he
now
has
.
He
is
confined
within
the
limitations
*NL*
of
his
earthly
envelope
.
He
can
not
melt
into
thin
air
nor
disappear
*NL*
through
cracks
or
chinks
or
crannies
.
If
he
go
through
a
doorway
,
he
*NL*
must
open
the
door
like
a
mortal
.
And
so
we
have
this
day
to
hunt
out
*NL*
all
his
lairs
and
sterilise
them
.
So
we
shall
,
if
we
have
not
yet
catch
*NL*
him
and
destroy
him
,
drive
him
to
bay
in
some
place
where
the
catching
*NL*
and
the
destroying
shall
be
,
in
time
,
sure
.
''
Here
I
started
up
for
I
*NL*
could
not
contain
myself
at
the
thought
that
the
minutes
and
seconds
so
*NL*
preciously
laden
with
Mina
's
life
and
happiness
were
flying
from
us
,
*NL*
since
whilst
we
talked
action
was
impossible
.
But
Van
Helsing
held
up
*NL*
his
hand
warningly
.
``
Nay
,
friend
Jonathan
,
''
he
said
,
``
in
this
,
the
*NL*
quickest
way
home
is
the
longest
way
,
so
your
proverb
say
.
We
shall
all
*NL*
act
and
act
with
desperate
quick
,
when
the
time
has
come
.
But
think
,
in
*NL*
all
probable
the
key
of
the
situation
is
in
that
house
in
Piccadilly
.
*NL*
The
Count
may
have
many
houses
which
he
has
bought
.
Of
them
he
will
have
*NL*
deeds
of
purchase
,
keys
and
other
things
.
He
will
have
paper
that
he
*NL*
write
on
;
he
will
have
his
book
of
cheques
.
There
are
many
belongings
*NL*
that
he
must
have
somewhere
;
why
not
in
this
place
so
central
,
so
quiet
,
*NL*
where
he
come
and
go
by
the
front
or
the
back
at
all
hour
,
when
in
the
*NL*
very
vast
of
the
traffic
there
is
none
to
notice
.
We
shall
go
there
and
*NL*
search
that
house
;
and
when
we
learn
what
it
holds
,
then
we
do
what
our
*NL*
friend
Arthur
call
,
in
his
phrases
of
hunt
`
stop
the
earths
'
and
so
we
*NL*
run
down
our
old
fox
--
so
?
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
us
come
at
once
,
''
I
cried
,
``
we
are
wasting
the
precious
,
*NL*
precious
time
!
''
The
Professor
did
not
move
,
but
simply
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
are
we
to
get
into
that
house
in
Piccadilly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
way
!
''
I
cried
.
``
We
shall
break
in
if
need
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
police
;
where
will
they
be
,
and
what
will
they
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
staggered
;
but
I
knew
that
if
he
wished
to
delay
he
had
a
good
*NL*
reason
for
it
.
So
I
said
,
as
quietly
as
I
could
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
wait
more
than
need
be
;
you
know
,
I
am
sure
,
what
torture
I
am
*NL*
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
child
,
that
I
do
;
and
indeed
there
is
no
wish
of
me
to
add
to
*NL*
your
anguish
.
But
just
think
,
what
can
we
do
,
until
all
the
world
be
at
*NL*
movement
.
Then
will
come
our
time
.
I
have
thought
and
thought
,
and
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
the
simplest
way
is
the
best
of
all
.
Now
we
wish
to
get
*NL*
into
the
house
,
but
we
have
no
key
;
is
it
not
so
?
''
I
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
suppose
that
you
were
,
in
truth
,
the
owner
of
that
house
,
and
could
*NL*
not
still
get
it
;
and
think
there
was
to
you
no
conscience
of
the
*NL*
housebreaker
,
what
would
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
get
a
respectable
locksmith
,
and
set
him
to
work
to
pick
the
*NL*
lock
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
police
,
they
would
interfere
,
would
they
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
not
if
they
knew
the
man
was
properly
employed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
he
looked
at
me
as
keenly
as
he
spoke
,
``
all
that
is
in
doubt
is
*NL*
the
conscience
of
the
employer
,
and
the
belief
of
your
policemen
as
to
*NL*
whether
or
no
that
employer
has
a
good
conscience
or
a
bad
one
.
Your
*NL*
police
must
indeed
be
zealous
men
and
clever
--
oh
,
so
clever
!
--
in
reading
*NL*
the
heart
,
that
they
trouble
themselves
in
such
matter
.
No
,
no
,
my
*NL*
friend
Jonathan
,
you
go
take
the
lock
off
a
hundred
empty
house
in
this
*NL*
your
London
,
or
of
any
city
in
the
world
;
and
if
you
do
it
as
such
*NL*
things
are
rightly
done
,
and
at
the
time
such
things
are
rightly
done
,
*NL*
no
one
will
interfere
.
I
have
read
of
a
gentleman
who
owned
a
so
fine
*NL*
house
in
London
,
and
when
he
went
for
months
of
summer
to
Switzerland
*NL*
and
lock
up
his
house
,
some
burglar
came
and
broke
window
at
back
and
*NL*
got
in
.
Then
he
went
and
made
open
the
shutters
in
front
and
walk
out
*NL*
and
in
through
the
door
,
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
police
.
Then
he
*NL*
have
an
auction
in
that
house
,
and
advertise
it
,
and
put
up
big
notice
;
*NL*
and
when
the
day
come
he
sell
off
by
a
great
auctioneer
all
the
goods
of
*NL*
that
other
man
who
own
them
.
Then
he
go
to
a
builder
,
and
he
sell
him
*NL*
that
house
,
making
an
agreement
that
he
pull
it
down
and
take
all
away
*NL*
within
a
certain
time
.
And
your
police
and
other
authority
help
him
all
*NL*
they
can
.
And
when
that
owner
come
back
from
his
holiday
in
Switzerland
*NL*
he
find
only
an
empty
hole
where
his
house
had
been
.
This
was
all
done
*NL*
_
en
regle
_
;
and
in
our
work
we
shall
be
_
en
regle
_
too
.
We
shall
not
go
*NL*
so
early
that
the
policemen
who
have
then
little
to
think
of
,
shall
deem
*NL*
it
strange
;
but
we
shall
go
after
ten
o'clock
,
when
there
are
many
*NL*
about
,
and
such
things
would
be
done
were
we
indeed
owners
of
the
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
but
see
how
right
he
was
and
the
terrible
despair
of
Mina
's
*NL*
face
became
relaxed
a
thought
;
there
was
hope
in
such
good
counsel
.
Van
*NL*
Helsing
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
once
within
that
house
we
may
find
more
clues
;
at
any
rate
some
of
*NL*
us
can
remain
there
whilst
the
rest
find
the
other
places
where
there
be
*NL*
more
earth-boxes
--
at
Bermondsey
and
Mile
End
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Godalming
stood
up
.
``
I
can
be
of
some
use
here
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
shall
*NL*
wire
to
my
people
to
have
horses
and
carriages
where
they
will
be
most
*NL*
convenient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
old
fellow
,
''
said
Morris
,
``
it
is
a
capital
idea
to
have
all
*NL*
ready
in
case
we
want
to
go
horsebacking
;
but
do
n't
you
think
that
one
*NL*
of
your
snappy
carriages
with
its
heraldic
adornments
in
a
byway
of
*NL*
Walworth
or
Mile
End
would
attract
too
much
attention
for
our
purposes
?
*NL*
It
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
take
cabs
when
we
go
south
or
east
;
and
*NL*
even
leave
them
somewhere
near
the
neighbourhood
we
are
going
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
Quincey
is
right
!
''
said
the
Professor
.
``
His
head
is
what
you
*NL*
call
in
plane
with
the
horizon
.
It
is
a
difficult
thing
that
we
go
to
*NL*
do
,
and
we
do
not
want
no
peoples
to
watch
us
if
so
it
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mina
took
a
growing
interest
in
everything
and
I
was
rejoiced
to
see
*NL*
that
the
exigency
of
affairs
was
helping
her
to
forget
for
a
time
the
*NL*
terrible
experience
of
the
night
.
She
was
very
,
very
pale
--
almost
*NL*
ghastly
,
and
so
thin
that
her
lips
were
drawn
away
,
showing
her
teeth
in
*NL*
somewhat
of
prominence
.
I
did
not
mention
this
last
,
lest
it
should
give
*NL*
her
needless
pain
;
but
it
made
my
blood
run
cold
in
my
veins
to
think
of
*NL*
what
had
occurred
with
poor
Lucy
when
the
Count
had
sucked
her
blood
.
As
*NL*
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
the
teeth
growing
sharper
;
but
the
time
as
yet
*NL*
was
short
,
and
there
was
time
for
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
discussion
of
the
sequence
of
our
efforts
and
of
the
*NL*
disposition
of
our
forces
,
there
were
new
sources
of
doubt
.
It
was
*NL*
finally
agreed
that
before
starting
for
Piccadilly
we
should
destroy
the
*NL*
Count
's
lair
close
at
hand
.
In
case
he
should
find
it
out
too
soon
,
we
*NL*
should
thus
be
still
ahead
of
him
in
our
work
of
destruction
;
and
his
*NL*
presence
in
his
purely
material
shape
,
and
at
his
weakest
,
might
give
us
*NL*
some
new
clue
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
disposal
of
forces
,
it
was
suggested
by
the
Professor
that
,
*NL*
after
our
visit
to
Carfax
,
we
should
all
enter
the
house
in
Piccadilly
;
*NL*
that
the
two
doctors
and
I
should
remain
there
,
whilst
Lord
Godalming
*NL*
and
Quincey
found
the
lairs
at
Walworth
and
Mile
End
and
destroyed
them
.
*NL*
It
was
possible
,
if
not
likely
,
the
Professor
urged
,
that
the
Count
*NL*
might
appear
in
Piccadilly
during
the
day
,
and
that
if
so
we
might
be
*NL*
able
to
cope
with
him
then
and
there
.
At
any
rate
,
we
might
be
able
to
*NL*
follow
him
in
force
.
To
this
plan
I
strenuously
objected
,
and
so
far
as
*NL*
my
going
was
concerned
,
for
I
said
that
I
intended
to
stay
and
protect
*NL*
Mina
,
I
thought
that
my
mind
was
made
up
on
the
subject
;
but
Mina
would
*NL*
not
listen
to
my
objection
.
She
said
that
there
might
be
some
law
matter
*NL*
in
which
I
could
be
useful
;
that
amongst
the
Count
's
papers
might
be
*NL*
some
clue
which
I
could
understand
out
of
my
experience
in
Transylvania
;
*NL*
and
that
,
as
it
was
,
all
the
strength
we
could
muster
was
required
to
*NL*
cope
with
the
Count
's
extraordinary
power
.
I
had
to
give
in
,
for
Mina
's
*NL*
resolution
was
fixed
;
she
said
that
it
was
the
last
hope
for
_
her
_
that
*NL*
we
should
all
work
together
.
``
As
for
me
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
have
no
fear
.
*NL*
Things
have
been
as
bad
as
they
can
be
;
and
whatever
may
happen
must
*NL*
have
in
it
some
element
of
hope
or
comfort
.
Go
,
my
husband
!
God
can
,
if
*NL*
He
wishes
it
,
guard
me
as
well
alone
as
with
any
one
present
.
''
So
I
*NL*
started
up
crying
out
:
``
Then
in
God
's
name
let
us
come
at
once
,
for
we
*NL*
are
losing
time
.
The
Count
may
come
to
Piccadilly
earlier
than
we
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
!
''
said
Van
Helsing
,
holding
up
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
forget
,
''
he
said
,
with
actually
a
smile
,
``
that
last
night
he
*NL*
banqueted
heavily
,
and
will
sleep
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Did
I
forget
!
shall
I
ever
--
can
I
ever
!
Can
any
of
us
ever
forget
that
*NL*
terrible
scene
!
Mina
struggled
hard
to
keep
her
brave
countenance
;
but
*NL*
the
pain
overmastered
her
and
she
put
her
hands
before
her
face
,
and
*NL*
shuddered
whilst
she
moaned
.
Van
Helsing
had
not
intended
to
recall
her
*NL*
frightful
experience
.
He
had
simply
lost
sight
of
her
and
her
part
in
*NL*
the
affair
in
his
intellectual
effort
.
When
it
struck
him
what
he
said
,
*NL*
he
was
horrified
at
his
thoughtlessness
and
tried
to
comfort
her
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
Madam
Mina
,
''
he
said
,
``
dear
,
dear
Madam
Mina
,
alas
!
that
I
of
all
who
so
*NL*
reverence
you
should
have
said
anything
so
forgetful
.
These
stupid
old
*NL*
lips
of
mine
and
this
stupid
old
head
do
not
deserve
so
;
but
you
will
*NL*
forget
it
,
will
you
not
?
''
He
bent
low
beside
her
as
he
spoke
;
she
took
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
looking
at
him
through
her
tears
,
said
hoarsely
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
shall
not
forget
,
for
it
is
well
that
I
remember
;
and
with
it
I
*NL*
have
so
much
in
memory
of
you
that
is
sweet
,
that
I
take
it
all
*NL*
together
.
Now
,
you
must
all
be
going
soon
.
Breakfast
is
ready
,
and
we
*NL*
must
all
eat
that
we
may
be
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Breakfast
was
a
strange
meal
to
us
all
.
We
tried
to
be
cheerful
and
*NL*
encourage
each
other
,
and
Mina
was
the
brightest
and
most
cheerful
of
*NL*
us
.
When
it
was
over
,
Van
Helsing
stood
up
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
dear
friends
,
we
go
forth
to
our
terrible
enterprise
.
Are
we
*NL*
all
armed
,
as
we
were
on
that
night
when
first
we
visited
our
enemy
's
*NL*
lair
;
armed
against
ghostly
as
well
as
carnal
attack
?
''
We
all
assured
*NL*
him
.
``
Then
it
is
well
.
Now
,
Madam
Mina
,
you
are
in
any
case
_
quite
_
safe
*NL*
here
until
the
sunset
;
and
before
then
we
shall
return
--
if
--
We
shall
*NL*
return
!
But
before
we
go
let
me
see
you
armed
against
personal
attack
.
I
*NL*
have
myself
,
since
you
came
down
,
prepared
your
chamber
by
the
placing
*NL*
of
things
of
which
we
know
,
so
that
He
may
not
enter
.
Now
let
me
guard
*NL*
yourself
.
On
your
forehead
I
touch
this
piece
of
Sacred
Wafer
in
the
*NL*
name
of
the
Father
,
the
Son
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
fearful
scream
which
almost
froze
our
hearts
to
hear
.
As
he
*NL*
had
placed
the
Wafer
on
Mina
's
forehead
,
it
had
seared
it
--
had
burned
*NL*
into
the
flesh
as
though
it
had
been
a
piece
of
white-hot
metal
.
My
poor
*NL*
darling
's
brain
had
told
her
the
significance
of
the
fact
as
quickly
as
*NL*
her
nerves
received
the
pain
of
it
;
and
the
two
so
overwhelmed
her
that
*NL*
her
overwrought
nature
had
its
voice
in
that
dreadful
scream
.
But
the
*NL*
words
to
her
thought
came
quickly
;
the
echo
of
the
scream
had
not
ceased
*NL*
to
ring
on
the
air
when
there
came
the
reaction
,
and
she
sank
on
her
*NL*
knees
on
the
floor
in
an
agony
of
abasement
.
Pulling
her
beautiful
hair
*NL*
over
her
face
,
as
the
leper
of
old
his
mantle
,
she
wailed
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unclean
!
Unclean
!
Even
the
Almighty
shuns
my
polluted
flesh
!
I
must
*NL*
bear
this
mark
of
shame
upon
my
forehead
until
the
Judgment
Day
.
''
They
*NL*
all
paused
.
I
had
thrown
myself
beside
her
in
an
agony
of
helpless
*NL*
grief
,
and
putting
my
arms
around
held
her
tight
.
For
a
few
minutes
our
*NL*
sorrowful
hearts
beat
together
,
whilst
the
friends
around
us
turned
away
*NL*
their
eyes
that
ran
tears
silently
.
Then
Van
Helsing
turned
and
said
*NL*
gravely
;
so
gravely
that
I
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
was
in
some
*NL*
way
inspired
,
and
was
stating
things
outside
himself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
that
you
may
have
to
bear
that
mark
till
God
himself
see
fit
,
*NL*
as
He
most
surely
shall
,
on
the
Judgment
Day
,
to
redress
all
wrongs
of
*NL*
the
earth
and
of
His
children
that
He
has
placed
thereon
.
And
oh
,
Madam
*NL*
Mina
,
my
dear
,
my
dear
,
may
we
who
love
you
be
there
to
see
,
when
that
*NL*
red
scar
,
the
sign
of
God
's
knowledge
of
what
has
been
,
shall
pass
away
,
*NL*
and
leave
your
forehead
as
pure
as
the
heart
we
know
.
For
so
surely
as
*NL*
we
live
,
that
scar
shall
pass
away
when
God
sees
right
to
lift
the
*NL*
burden
that
is
hard
upon
us
.
Till
then
we
bear
our
Cross
,
as
His
Son
did
*NL*
in
obedience
to
His
Will
.
It
may
be
that
we
are
chosen
instruments
of
*NL*
His
good
pleasure
,
and
that
we
ascend
to
His
bidding
as
that
other
*NL*
through
stripes
and
shame
;
through
tears
and
blood
;
through
doubts
and
*NL*
fears
,
and
all
that
makes
the
difference
between
God
and
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
hope
in
his
words
,
and
comfort
;
and
they
made
for
resignation
.
*NL*
Mina
and
I
both
felt
so
,
and
simultaneously
we
each
took
one
of
the
old
*NL*
man
's
hands
and
bent
over
and
kissed
it
.
Then
without
a
word
we
all
*NL*
knelt
down
together
,
and
,
all
holding
hands
,
swore
to
be
true
to
each
*NL*
other
.
We
men
pledged
ourselves
to
raise
the
veil
of
sorrow
from
the
*NL*
head
of
her
whom
,
each
in
his
own
way
,
we
loved
;
and
we
prayed
for
help
*NL*
and
guidance
in
the
terrible
task
which
lay
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
time
to
start
.
So
I
said
farewell
to
Mina
,
a
parting
which
*NL*
neither
of
us
shall
forget
to
our
dying
day
;
and
we
set
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
one
thing
I
have
made
up
my
mind
:
if
we
find
out
that
Mina
must
be
a
*NL*
vampire
in
the
end
,
then
she
shall
not
go
into
that
unknown
and
terrible
*NL*
land
alone
.
I
suppose
it
is
thus
that
in
old
times
one
vampire
meant
*NL*
many
;
just
as
their
hideous
bodies
could
only
rest
in
sacred
earth
,
so
*NL*
the
holiest
love
was
the
recruiting
sergeant
for
their
ghastly
ranks
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
entered
Carfax
without
trouble
and
found
all
things
the
same
as
on
*NL*
the
first
occasion
.
It
was
hard
to
believe
that
amongst
so
prosaic
*NL*
surroundings
of
neglect
and
dust
and
decay
there
was
any
ground
for
such
*NL*
fear
as
already
we
knew
.
Had
not
our
minds
been
made
up
,
and
had
there
*NL*
not
been
terrible
memories
to
spur
us
on
,
we
could
hardly
have
proceeded
*NL*
with
our
task
.
We
found
no
papers
,
or
any
sign
of
use
in
the
house
;
and
*NL*
in
the
old
chapel
the
great
boxes
looked
just
as
we
had
seen
them
last
.
*NL*
Dr.
Van
Helsing
said
to
us
solemnly
as
we
stood
before
them
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
my
friends
,
we
have
a
duty
here
to
do
.
We
must
sterilise
this
*NL*
earth
,
so
sacred
of
holy
memories
,
that
he
has
brought
from
a
far
*NL*
distant
land
for
such
fell
use
.
He
has
chosen
this
earth
because
it
has
*NL*
been
holy
.
Thus
we
defeat
him
with
his
own
weapon
,
for
we
make
it
more
*NL*
holy
still
.
It
was
sanctified
to
such
use
of
man
,
now
we
sanctify
it
to
*NL*
God
.
''
As
he
spoke
he
took
from
his
bag
a
screwdriver
and
a
wrench
,
and
*NL*
very
soon
the
top
of
one
of
the
cases
was
thrown
open
.
The
earth
smelled
*NL*
musty
and
close
;
but
we
did
not
somehow
seem
to
mind
,
for
our
attention
*NL*
was
concentrated
on
the
Professor
.
Taking
from
his
box
a
piece
of
the
*NL*
Sacred
Wafer
he
laid
it
reverently
on
the
earth
,
and
then
shutting
down
*NL*
the
lid
began
to
screw
it
home
,
we
aiding
him
as
he
worked
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
by
one
we
treated
in
the
same
way
each
of
the
great
boxes
,
and
left
*NL*
them
as
we
had
found
them
to
all
appearance
;
but
in
each
was
a
portion
*NL*
of
the
Host
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
closed
the
door
behind
us
,
the
Professor
said
solemnly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
is
already
done
.
If
it
may
be
that
with
all
the
others
we
can
*NL*
be
so
successful
,
then
the
sunset
of
this
evening
may
shine
on
Madam
*NL*
Mina
's
forehead
all
white
as
ivory
and
with
no
stain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
passed
across
the
lawn
on
our
way
to
the
station
to
catch
our
*NL*
train
we
could
see
the
front
of
the
asylum
.
I
looked
eagerly
,
and
in
the
*NL*
window
of
my
own
room
saw
Mina
.
I
waved
my
hand
to
her
,
and
nodded
to
*NL*
tell
that
our
work
there
was
successfully
accomplished
.
She
nodded
in
*NL*
reply
to
show
that
she
understood
.
The
last
I
saw
,
she
was
waving
her
*NL*
hand
in
farewell
.
It
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
we
sought
the
station
*NL*
and
just
caught
the
train
,
which
was
steaming
in
as
we
reached
the
*NL*
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
written
this
in
the
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Piccadilly
,
12:30
o'clock
.
_
--
Just
before
we
reached
Fenchurch
Street
*NL*
Lord
Godalming
said
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quincey
and
I
will
find
a
locksmith
.
You
had
better
not
come
with
us
in
*NL*
case
there
should
be
any
difficulty
;
for
under
the
circumstances
it
*NL*
would
n't
seem
so
bad
for
us
to
break
into
an
empty
house
.
But
you
are
a
*NL*
solicitor
and
the
Incorporated
Law
Society
might
tell
you
that
you
*NL*
should
have
known
better
.
''
I
demurred
as
to
my
not
sharing
any
danger
*NL*
even
of
odium
,
but
he
went
on
:
``
Besides
,
it
will
attract
less
attention
*NL*
if
there
are
not
too
many
of
us
.
My
title
will
make
it
all
right
with
*NL*
the
locksmith
,
and
with
any
policeman
that
may
come
along
.
You
had
*NL*
better
go
with
Jack
and
the
Professor
and
stay
in
the
Green
Park
,
*NL*
somewhere
in
sight
of
the
house
;
and
when
you
see
the
door
opened
and
*NL*
the
smith
has
gone
away
,
do
you
all
come
across
.
We
shall
be
on
the
*NL*
lookout
for
you
,
and
shall
let
you
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
advice
is
good
!
''
said
Van
Helsing
,
so
we
said
no
more
.
Godalming
*NL*
and
Morris
hurried
off
in
a
cab
,
we
following
in
another
.
At
the
corner
*NL*
of
Arlington
Street
our
contingent
got
out
and
strolled
into
the
Green
*NL*
Park
.
My
heart
beat
as
I
saw
the
house
on
which
so
much
of
our
hope
was
*NL*
centred
,
looming
up
grim
and
silent
in
its
deserted
condition
amongst
*NL*
its
more
lively
and
spruce-looking
neighbours
.
We
sat
down
on
a
bench
*NL*
within
good
view
,
and
began
to
smoke
cigars
so
as
to
attract
as
little
*NL*
attention
as
possible
.
The
minutes
seemed
to
pass
with
leaden
feet
as
we
*NL*
waited
for
the
coming
of
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
we
saw
a
four-wheeler
drive
up
.
Out
of
it
,
in
leisurely
*NL*
fashion
,
got
Lord
Godalming
and
Morris
;
and
down
from
the
box
descended
*NL*
a
thick-set
working
man
with
his
rush-woven
basket
of
tools
.
Morris
paid
*NL*
the
cabman
,
who
touched
his
hat
and
drove
away
.
Together
the
two
*NL*
ascended
the
steps
,
and
Lord
Godalming
pointed
out
what
he
wanted
done
.
*NL*
The
workman
took
off
his
coat
leisurely
and
hung
it
on
one
of
the
spikes
*NL*
of
the
rail
,
saying
something
to
a
policeman
who
just
then
sauntered
*NL*
along
.
The
policeman
nodded
acquiescence
,
and
the
man
kneeling
down
*NL*
placed
his
bag
beside
him
.
After
searching
through
it
,
he
took
out
a
*NL*
selection
of
tools
which
he
produced
to
lay
beside
him
in
orderly
*NL*
fashion
.
Then
he
stood
up
,
looked
into
the
keyhole
,
blew
into
it
,
and
*NL*
turning
to
his
employers
,
made
some
remark
.
Lord
Godalming
smiled
,
and
*NL*
the
man
lifted
a
good-sized
bunch
of
keys
;
selecting
one
of
them
,
he
*NL*
began
to
probe
the
lock
,
as
if
feeling
his
way
with
it
.
After
fumbling
*NL*
about
for
a
bit
he
tried
a
second
,
and
then
a
third
.
All
at
once
the
*NL*
door
opened
under
a
slight
push
from
him
,
and
he
and
the
two
others
*NL*
entered
the
hall
.
We
sat
still
;
my
own
cigar
burnt
furiously
,
but
Van
*NL*
Helsing
's
went
cold
altogether
.
We
waited
patiently
as
we
saw
the
*NL*
workman
come
out
and
bring
in
his
bag
.
Then
he
held
the
door
partly
*NL*
open
,
steadying
it
with
his
knees
,
whilst
he
fitted
a
key
to
the
lock
.
*NL*
This
he
finally
handed
to
Lord
Godalming
,
who
took
out
his
purse
and
*NL*
gave
him
something
.
The
man
touched
his
hat
,
took
his
bag
,
put
on
his
*NL*
coat
and
departed
;
not
a
soul
took
the
slightest
notice
of
the
whole
*NL*
transaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
man
had
fairly
gone
,
we
three
crossed
the
street
and
knocked
at
*NL*
the
door
.
It
was
immediately
opened
by
Quincey
Morris
,
beside
whom
stood
*NL*
Lord
Godalming
lighting
a
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
place
smells
so
vilely
,
''
said
the
latter
as
we
came
in
.
It
did
*NL*
indeed
smell
vilely
--
like
the
old
chapel
at
Carfax
--
and
with
our
*NL*
previous
experience
it
was
plain
to
us
that
the
Count
had
been
using
the
*NL*
place
pretty
freely
.
We
moved
to
explore
the
house
,
all
keeping
together
*NL*
in
case
of
attack
;
for
we
knew
we
had
a
strong
and
wily
enemy
to
deal
*NL*
with
,
and
as
yet
we
did
not
know
whether
the
Count
might
not
be
in
the
*NL*
house
.
In
the
dining-room
,
which
lay
at
the
back
of
the
hall
,
we
found
*NL*
eight
boxes
of
earth
.
Eight
boxes
only
out
of
the
nine
,
which
we
sought
!
*NL*
Our
work
was
not
over
,
and
would
never
be
until
we
should
have
found
the
*NL*
missing
box
.
First
we
opened
the
shutters
of
the
window
which
looked
out
*NL*
across
a
narrow
stone-flagged
yard
at
the
blank
face
of
a
stable
,
*NL*
pointed
to
look
like
the
front
of
a
miniature
house
.
There
were
no
*NL*
windows
in
it
,
so
we
were
not
afraid
of
being
over-looked
.
We
did
not
*NL*
lose
any
time
in
examining
the
chests
.
With
the
tools
which
we
had
*NL*
brought
with
us
we
opened
them
,
one
by
one
,
and
treated
them
as
we
had
*NL*
treated
those
others
in
the
old
chapel
.
It
was
evident
to
us
that
the
*NL*
Count
was
not
at
present
in
the
house
,
and
we
proceeded
to
search
for
*NL*
any
of
his
effects
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
cursory
glance
at
the
rest
of
the
rooms
,
from
basement
to
attic
,
*NL*
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
dining-room
contained
any
effects
*NL*
which
might
belong
to
the
Count
;
and
so
we
proceeded
to
minutely
examine
*NL*
them
.
They
lay
in
a
sort
of
orderly
disorder
on
the
great
dining-room
*NL*
table
.
There
were
title
deeds
of
the
Piccadilly
house
in
a
great
bundle
;
*NL*
deeds
of
the
purchase
of
the
houses
at
Mile
End
and
Bermondsey
;
*NL*
note-paper
,
envelopes
,
and
pens
and
ink
.
All
were
covered
up
in
thin
*NL*
wrapping
paper
to
keep
them
from
the
dust
.
There
were
also
a
clothes
*NL*
brush
,
a
brush
and
comb
,
and
a
jug
and
basin
--
the
latter
containing
*NL*
dirty
water
which
was
reddened
as
if
with
blood
.
Last
of
all
was
a
*NL*
little
heap
of
keys
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
,
probably
those
belonging
to
*NL*
the
other
houses
.
When
we
had
examined
this
last
find
,
Lord
Godalming
*NL*
and
Quincey
Morris
taking
accurate
notes
of
the
various
addresses
of
the
*NL*
houses
in
the
East
and
the
South
,
took
with
them
the
keys
in
a
great
*NL*
bunch
,
and
set
out
to
destroy
the
boxes
in
these
places
.
The
rest
of
us
*NL*
are
,
with
what
patience
we
can
,
waiting
their
return
--
or
the
coming
of
*NL*
the
Count

SEWARD
'S
DIARY

*NL*
_
3
October
.
_
--
The
time
seemed
terrible
long
whilst
we
were
waiting
for
*NL*
the
coming
of
Godalming
and
Quincey
Morris
.
The
Professor
tried
to
keep
*NL*
our
minds
active
by
using
them
all
the
time
.
I
could
see
his
beneficent
*NL*
purpose
,
by
the
side
glances
which
he
threw
from
time
to
time
at
Harker
.
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
is
overwhelmed
in
a
misery
that
is
appalling
to
see
.
*NL*
Last
night
he
was
a
frank
,
happy-looking
man
,
with
strong
,
youthful
*NL*
face
,
full
of
energy
,
and
with
dark
brown
hair
.
To-day
he
is
a
drawn
,
*NL*
haggard
old
man
,
whose
white
hair
matches
well
with
the
hollow
burning
*NL*
eyes
and
grief-written
lines
of
his
face
.
His
energy
is
still
intact
;
in
*NL*
fact
,
he
is
like
a
living
flame
.
This
may
yet
be
his
salvation
,
for
,
if
*NL*
all
go
well
,
it
will
tide
him
over
the
despairing
period
;
he
will
then
,
*NL*
in
a
kind
of
way
,
wake
again
to
the
realities
of
life
.
Poor
fellow
,
I
*NL*
thought
my
own
trouble
was
bad
enough
,
but
his
--
!
The
Professor
knows
*NL*
this
well
enough
,
and
is
doing
his
best
to
keep
his
mind
active
.
What
he
*NL*
has
been
saying
was
,
under
the
circumstances
,
of
absorbing
interest
.
So
*NL*
well
as
I
can
remember
,
here
it
is
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
studied
,
over
and
over
again
since
they
came
into
my
hands
,
all
*NL*
the
papers
relating
to
this
monster
;
and
the
more
I
have
studied
,
the
*NL*
greater
seems
the
necessity
to
utterly
stamp
him
out
.
All
through
there
*NL*
are
signs
of
his
advance
;
not
only
of
his
power
,
but
of
his
knowledge
of
*NL*
it
.
As
I
learned
from
the
researches
of
my
friend
Arminus
of
Buda-Pesth
,
*NL*
he
was
in
life
a
most
wonderful
man
.
Soldier
,
statesman
,
and
*NL*
alchemist
--
which
latter
was
the
highest
development
of
the
*NL*
science-knowledge
of
his
time
.
He
had
a
mighty
brain
,
a
learning
beyond
*NL*
compare
,
and
a
heart
that
knew
no
fear
and
no
remorse
.
He
dared
even
to
*NL*
attend
the
Scholomance
,
and
there
was
no
branch
of
knowledge
of
his
time
*NL*
that
he
did
not
essay
.
Well
,
in
him
the
brain
powers
survived
the
*NL*
physical
death
;
though
it
would
seem
that
memory
was
not
all
complete
.
*NL*
In
some
faculties
of
mind
he
has
been
,
and
is
,
only
a
child
;
but
he
is
*NL*
growing
,
and
some
things
that
were
childish
at
the
first
are
now
of
*NL*
man
's
stature
.
He
is
experimenting
,
and
doing
it
well
;
and
if
it
had
not
*NL*
been
that
we
have
crossed
his
path
he
would
be
yet
--
he
may
be
yet
if
we
*NL*
fail
--
the
father
or
furtherer
of
a
new
order
of
beings
,
whose
road
must
*NL*
lead
through
Death
,
not
Life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harker
groaned
and
said
,
``
And
this
is
all
arrayed
against
my
darling
!
*NL*
But
how
is
he
experimenting
?
The
knowledge
may
help
us
to
defeat
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
all
along
,
since
his
coming
,
been
trying
his
power
,
slowly
but
*NL*
surely
;
that
big
child-brain
of
his
is
working
.
Well
for
us
,
it
is
,
as
*NL*
yet
,
a
child-brain
;
for
had
he
dared
,
at
the
first
,
to
attempt
certain
*NL*
things
he
would
long
ago
have
been
beyond
our
power
.
However
,
he
means
*NL*
to
succeed
,
and
a
man
who
has
centuries
before
him
can
afford
to
wait
*NL*
and
to
go
slow
.
_
Festina
lente
_
may
well
be
his
motto
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fail
to
understand
,
''
said
Harker
wearily
.
``
Oh
,
do
be
more
plain
to
*NL*
me
!
Perhaps
grief
and
trouble
are
dulling
my
brain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Professor
laid
his
hand
tenderly
on
his
shoulder
as
he
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
child
,
I
will
be
plain
.
Do
you
not
see
how
,
of
late
,
this
*NL*
monster
has
been
creeping
into
knowledge
experimentally
.
How
he
has
been
*NL*
making
use
of
the
zooephagous
patient
to
effect
his
entry
into
friend
*NL*
John
's
home
;
for
your
Vampire
,
though
in
all
afterwards
he
can
come
when
*NL*
and
how
he
will
,
must
at
the
first
make
entry
only
when
asked
thereto
by
*NL*
an
inmate
.
But
these
are
not
his
most
important
experiments
.
Do
we
not
*NL*
see
how
at
the
first
all
these
so
great
boxes
were
moved
by
others
.
He
*NL*
knew
not
then
but
that
must
be
so
.
But
all
the
time
that
so
great
*NL*
child-brain
of
his
was
growing
,
and
he
began
to
consider
whether
he
*NL*
might
not
himself
move
the
box
.
So
he
began
to
help
;
and
then
,
when
he
*NL*
found
that
this
be
all-right
,
he
try
to
move
them
all
alone
.
And
so
he
*NL*
progress
,
and
he
scatter
these
graves
of
him
;
and
none
but
he
know
where
*NL*
they
are
hidden
.
He
may
have
intend
to
bury
them
deep
in
the
ground
.
So
*NL*
that
he
only
use
them
in
the
night
,
or
at
such
time
as
he
can
change
his
*NL*
form
,
they
do
him
equal
well
;
and
none
may
know
these
are
his
*NL*
hiding-place
!
But
,
my
child
,
do
not
despair
;
this
knowledge
come
to
him
*NL*
just
too
late
!
Already
all
of
his
lairs
but
one
be
sterilise
as
for
him
;
*NL*
and
before
the
sunset
this
shall
be
so
.
Then
he
have
no
place
where
he
*NL*
can
move
and
hide
.
I
delayed
this
morning
that
so
we
might
be
sure
.
Is
*NL*
there
not
more
at
stake
for
us
than
for
him
?
Then
why
we
not
be
even
*NL*
more
careful
than
him
?
By
my
clock
it
is
one
hour
and
already
,
if
all
be
*NL*
well
,
friend
Arthur
and
Quincey
are
on
their
way
to
us
.
To-day
is
our
*NL*
day
,
and
we
must
go
sure
,
if
slow
,
and
lose
no
chance
.
See
!
there
are
*NL*
five
of
us
when
those
absent
ones
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
he
was
speaking
we
were
startled
by
a
knock
at
the
hall
door
,
the
*NL*
double
postman
's
knock
of
the
telegraph
boy
.
We
all
moved
out
to
the
*NL*
hall
with
one
impulse
,
and
Van
Helsing
,
holding
up
his
hand
to
us
to
*NL*
keep
silence
,
stepped
to
the
door
and
opened
it
.
The
boy
handed
in
a
*NL*
despatch
.
The
Professor
closed
the
door
again
,
and
,
after
looking
at
the
*NL*
direction
,
opened
it
and
read
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
for
D
.
He
has
just
now
,
12:45
,
come
from
Carfax
hurriedly
and
*NL*
hastened
towards
the
South
.
He
seems
to
be
going
the
round
and
may
want
*NL*
to
see
you
:
Mina
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
,
broken
by
Jonathan
Harker
's
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
God
be
thanked
,
we
shall
soon
meet
!
''
Van
Helsing
turned
to
him
*NL*
quickly
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
will
act
in
His
own
way
and
time
.
Do
not
fear
,
and
do
not
rejoice
*NL*
as
yet
;
for
what
we
wish
for
at
the
moment
may
be
our
undoings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
care
for
nothing
now
,
''
he
answered
hotly
,
``
except
to
wipe
out
this
*NL*
brute
from
the
face
of
creation
.
I
would
sell
my
soul
to
do
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hush
,
hush
,
my
child
!
''
said
Van
Helsing
.
``
God
does
not
purchase
*NL*
souls
in
this
wise
;
and
the
Devil
,
though
he
may
purchase
,
does
not
keep
*NL*
faith
.
But
God
is
merciful
and
just
,
and
knows
your
pain
and
your
*NL*
devotion
to
that
dear
Madam
Mina
.
Think
you
,
how
her
pain
would
be
*NL*
doubled
,
did
she
but
hear
your
wild
words
.
Do
not
fear
any
of
us
,
we
are
*NL*
all
devoted
to
this
cause
,
and
to-day
shall
see
the
end
.
The
time
is
*NL*
coming
for
action
;
to-day
this
Vampire
is
limit
to
the
powers
of
man
,
*NL*
and
till
sunset
he
may
not
change
.
It
will
take
him
time
to
arrive
*NL*
here
--
see
,
it
is
twenty
minutes
past
one
--
and
there
are
yet
some
times
*NL*
before
he
can
hither
come
,
be
he
never
so
quick
.
What
we
must
hope
for
*NL*
is
that
my
Lord
Arthur
and
Quincey
arrive
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
About
half
an
hour
after
we
had
received
Mrs.
Harker
's
telegram
,
there
*NL*
came
a
quiet
,
resolute
knock
at
the
hall
door
.
It
was
just
an
ordinary
*NL*
knock
,
such
as
is
given
hourly
by
thousands
of
gentlemen
,
but
it
made
*NL*
the
Professor
's
heart
and
mine
beat
loudly
.
We
looked
at
each
other
,
and
*NL*
together
moved
out
into
the
hall
;
we
each
held
ready
to
use
our
various
*NL*
armaments
--
the
spiritual
in
the
left
hand
,
the
mortal
in
the
right
.
Van
*NL*
Helsing
pulled
back
the
latch
,
and
,
holding
the
door
half
open
,
stood
*NL*
back
,
having
both
hands
ready
for
action
.
The
gladness
of
our
hearts
*NL*
must
have
shown
upon
our
faces
when
on
the
step
,
close
to
the
door
,
we
*NL*
saw
Lord
Godalming
and
Quincey
Morris
.
They
came
quickly
in
and
closed
*NL*
the
door
behind
them
,
the
former
saying
,
as
they
moved
along
the
*NL*
hall
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
right
.
We
found
both
places
;
six
boxes
in
each
and
we
*NL*
destroyed
them
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Destroyed
?
''
asked
the
Professor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
him
!
''
We
were
silent
for
a
minute
,
and
then
Quincey
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
here
.
If
,
however
,
he
does
n't
turn
up
*NL*
by
five
o'clock
,
we
must
start
off
;
for
it
wo
n't
do
to
leave
Mrs.
Harker
*NL*
alone
after
sunset
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
be
here
before
long
now
,
''
said
Van
Helsing
,
who
had
been
*NL*
consulting
his
pocket-book
.
''
_
Nota
bene
_
,
in
Madam
's
telegram
he
went
*NL*
south
from
Carfax
,
that
means
he
went
to
cross
the
river
,
and
he
could
*NL*
only
do
so
at
slack
of
tide
,
which
should
be
something
before
one
*NL*
o'clock
.
That
he
went
south
has
a
meaning
for
us
.
He
is
as
yet
only
*NL*
suspicious
;
and
he
went
from
Carfax
first
to
the
place
where
he
would
*NL*
suspect
interference
least
.
You
must
have
been
at
Bermondsey
only
a
*NL*
short
time
before
him
.
That
he
is
not
here
already
shows
that
he
went
to
*NL*
Mile
End
next
.
This
took
him
some
time
;
for
he
would
then
have
to
be
*NL*
carried
over
the
river
in
some
way
.
Believe
me
,
my
friends
,
we
shall
not
*NL*
have
long
to
wait
now
.
We
should
have
ready
some
plan
of
attack
,
so
that
*NL*
we
may
throw
away
no
chance
.
Hush
,
there
is
no
time
now
.
Have
all
your
*NL*
arms
!
Be
ready
!
''
He
held
up
a
warning
hand
as
he
spoke
,
for
we
all
could
*NL*
hear
a
key
softly
inserted
in
the
lock
of
the
hall
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
but
admire
,
even
at
such
a
moment
,
the
way
in
which
a
*NL*
dominant
spirit
asserted
itself
.
In
all
our
hunting
parties
and
*NL*
adventures
in
different
parts
of
the
world
,
Quincey
Morris
had
always
*NL*
been
the
one
to
arrange
the
plan
of
action
,
and
Arthur
and
I
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
obey
him
implicitly
.
Now
,
the
old
habit
seemed
to
be
*NL*
renewed
instinctively
.
With
a
swift
glance
around
the
room
,
he
at
once
*NL*
laid
out
our
plan
of
attack
,
and
,
without
speaking
a
word
,
with
a
*NL*
gesture
,
placed
us
each
in
position
.
Van
Helsing
,
Harker
,
and
I
were
*NL*
just
behind
the
door
,
so
that
when
it
was
opened
the
Professor
could
*NL*
guard
it
whilst
we
two
stepped
between
the
incomer
and
the
door
.
*NL*
Godalming
behind
and
Quincey
in
front
stood
just
out
of
sight
ready
to
*NL*
move
in
front
of
the
window
.
We
waited
in
a
suspense
that
made
the
*NL*
seconds
pass
with
nightmare
slowness
.
The
slow
,
careful
steps
came
along
*NL*
the
hall
;
the
Count
was
evidently
prepared
for
some
surprise
--
at
least
*NL*
he
feared
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
with
a
single
bound
he
leaped
into
the
room
,
winning
a
way
past
*NL*
us
before
any
of
us
could
raise
a
hand
to
stay
him
.
There
was
something
*NL*
so
panther-like
in
the
movement
--
something
so
unhuman
,
that
it
seemed
*NL*
to
sober
us
all
from
the
shock
of
his
coming
.
The
first
to
act
was
*NL*
Harker
,
who
,
with
a
quick
movement
,
threw
himself
before
the
door
*NL*
leading
into
the
room
in
the
front
of
the
house
.
As
the
Count
saw
us
,
a
*NL*
horrible
sort
of
snarl
passed
over
his
face
,
showing
the
eye-teeth
long
*NL*
and
pointed
;
but
the
evil
smile
as
quickly
passed
into
a
cold
stare
of
*NL*
lion-like
disdain
.
His
expression
again
changed
as
,
with
a
single
*NL*
impulse
,
we
all
advanced
upon
him
.
It
was
a
pity
that
we
had
not
some
*NL*
better
organised
plan
of
attack
,
for
even
at
the
moment
I
wondered
what
*NL*
we
were
to
do
.
I
did
not
myself
know
whether
our
lethal
weapons
would
*NL*
avail
us
anything
.
Harker
evidently
meant
to
try
the
matter
,
for
he
had
*NL*
ready
his
great
Kukri
knife
and
made
a
fierce
and
sudden
cut
at
him
.
The
*NL*
blow
was
a
powerful
one
;
only
the
diabolical
quickness
of
the
Count
's
*NL*
leap
back
saved
him
.
A
second
less
and
the
trenchant
blade
had
shorne
*NL*
through
his
heart
.
As
it
was
,
the
point
just
cut
the
cloth
of
his
coat
,
*NL*
making
a
wide
gap
whence
a
bundle
of
bank-notes
and
a
stream
of
gold
*NL*
fell
out
.
The
expression
of
the
Count
's
face
was
so
hellish
,
that
for
a
*NL*
moment
I
feared
for
Harker
,
though
I
saw
him
throw
the
terrible
knife
*NL*
aloft
again
for
another
stroke
.
Instinctively
I
moved
forward
with
a
*NL*
protective
impulse
,
holding
the
Crucifix
and
Wafer
in
my
left
hand
.
I
*NL*
felt
a
mighty
power
fly
along
my
arm
;
and
it
was
without
surprise
that
I
*NL*
saw
the
monster
cower
back
before
a
similar
movement
made
spontaneously
*NL*
by
each
one
of
us
.
It
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
expression
of
*NL*
hate
and
baffled
malignity
--
of
anger
and
hellish
rage
--
which
came
over
*NL*
the
Count
's
face
.
His
waxen
hue
became
greenish-yellow
by
the
contrast
*NL*
of
his
burning
eyes
,
and
the
red
scar
on
the
forehead
showed
on
the
*NL*
pallid
skin
like
a
palpitating
wound
.
The
next
instant
,
with
a
sinuous
*NL*
dive
he
swept
under
Harker
's
arm
,
ere
his
blow
could
fall
,
and
,
grasping
*NL*
a
handful
of
the
money
from
the
floor
,
dashed
across
the
room
,
threw
*NL*
himself
at
the
window
.
Amid
the
crash
and
glitter
of
the
falling
glass
,
*NL*
he
tumbled
into
the
flagged
area
below
.
Through
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
shivering
glass
I
could
hear
the
``
ting
''
of
the
gold
,
as
some
of
the
*NL*
sovereigns
fell
on
the
flagging
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
ran
over
and
saw
him
spring
unhurt
from
the
ground
.
He
,
rushing
up
*NL*
the
steps
,
crossed
the
flagged
yard
,
and
pushed
open
the
stable
door
.
*NL*
There
he
turned
and
spoke
to
us
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
to
baffle
me
,
you
--
with
your
pale
faces
all
in
a
row
,
like
*NL*
sheep
in
a
butcher
's
.
You
shall
be
sorry
yet
,
each
one
of
you
!
You
think
*NL*
you
have
left
me
without
a
place
to
rest
;
but
I
have
more
.
My
revenge
is
*NL*
just
begun
!
I
spread
it
over
centuries
,
and
time
is
on
my
side
.
Your
*NL*
girls
that
you
all
love
are
mine
already
;
and
through
them
you
and
*NL*
others
shall
yet
be
mine
--
my
creatures
,
to
do
my
bidding
and
to
be
my
*NL*
jackals
when
I
want
to
feed
.
Bah
!
''
With
a
contemptuous
sneer
,
he
passed
*NL*
quickly
through
the
door
,
and
we
heard
the
rusty
bolt
creak
as
he
*NL*
fastened
it
behind
him
.
A
door
beyond
opened
and
shut
.
The
first
of
us
*NL*
to
speak
was
the
Professor
,
as
,
realising
the
difficulty
of
following
*NL*
him
through
the
stable
,
we
moved
toward
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
learnt
something
--
much
!
Notwithstanding
his
brave
words
,
he
*NL*
fears
us
;
he
fear
time
,
he
fear
want
!
For
if
not
,
why
he
hurry
so
?
His
*NL*
very
tone
betray
him
,
or
my
ears
deceive
.
Why
take
that
money
?
You
*NL*
follow
quick
.
You
are
hunters
of
wild
beast
,
and
understand
it
so
.
For
*NL*
me
,
I
make
sure
that
nothing
here
may
be
of
use
to
him
,
if
so
that
he
*NL*
return
.
''
As
he
spoke
he
put
the
money
remaining
into
his
pocket
;
took
*NL*
the
title-deeds
in
the
bundle
as
Harker
had
left
them
,
and
swept
the
*NL*
remaining
things
into
the
open
fireplace
,
where
he
set
fire
to
them
with
*NL*
a
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
Godalming
and
Morris
had
rushed
out
into
the
yard
,
and
Harker
had
*NL*
lowered
himself
from
the
window
to
follow
the
Count
.
He
had
,
however
,
*NL*
bolted
the
stable
door
;
and
by
the
time
they
had
forced
it
open
there
*NL*
was
no
sign
of
him
.
Van
Helsing
and
I
tried
to
make
inquiry
at
the
back
*NL*
of
the
house
;
but
the
mews
was
deserted
and
no
one
had
seen
him
depart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
late
in
the
afternoon
,
and
sunset
was
not
far
off
.
We
had
to
*NL*
recognise
that
our
game
was
up
;
with
heavy
hearts
we
agreed
with
the
*NL*
Professor
when
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
back
to
Madam
Mina
--
poor
,
poor
dear
Madam
Mina
.
All
we
can
do
*NL*
just
now
is
done
;
and
we
can
there
,
at
least
,
protect
her
.
But
we
need
*NL*
not
despair
.
There
is
but
one
more
earth-box
,
and
we
must
try
to
find
*NL*
it
;
when
that
is
done
all
may
yet
be
well
.
''
I
could
see
that
he
spoke
as
*NL*
bravely
as
he
could
to
comfort
Harker
.
The
poor
fellow
was
quite
broken
*NL*
down
;
now
and
again
he
gave
a
low
groan
which
he
could
not
suppress
--
he
*NL*
was
thinking
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
sad
hearts
we
came
back
to
my
house
,
where
we
found
Mrs.
Harker
*NL*
waiting
us
,
with
an
appearance
of
cheerfulness
which
did
honour
to
her
*NL*
bravery
and
unselfishness
.
When
she
saw
our
faces
,
her
own
became
as
*NL*
pale
as
death
:
for
a
second
or
two
her
eyes
were
closed
as
if
she
were
*NL*
in
secret
prayer
;
and
then
she
said
cheerfully
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
never
thank
you
all
enough
.
Oh
,
my
poor
darling
!
''
As
she
spoke
,
*NL*
she
took
her
husband
's
grey
head
in
her
hands
and
kissed
it
--
``
Lay
your
*NL*
poor
head
here
and
rest
it
.
All
will
yet
be
well
,
dear
!
God
will
protect
*NL*
us
if
He
so
will
it
in
His
good
intent
.
''
The
poor
fellow
groaned
.
There
*NL*
was
no
place
for
words
in
his
sublime
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
sort
of
perfunctory
supper
together
,
and
I
think
it
cheered
us
*NL*
all
up
somewhat
.
It
was
,
perhaps
,
the
mere
animal
heat
of
food
to
hungry
*NL*
people
--
for
none
of
us
had
eaten
anything
since
breakfast
--
or
the
sense
*NL*
of
companionship
may
have
helped
us
;
but
anyhow
we
were
all
less
*NL*
miserable
,
and
saw
the
morrow
as
not
altogether
without
hope
.
True
to
*NL*
our
promise
,
we
told
Mrs.
Harker
everything
which
had
passed
;
and
*NL*
although
she
grew
snowy
white
at
times
when
danger
had
seemed
to
*NL*
threaten
her
husband
,
and
red
at
others
when
his
devotion
to
her
was
*NL*
manifested
,
she
listened
bravely
and
with
calmness
.
When
we
came
to
the
*NL*
part
where
Harker
had
rushed
at
the
Count
so
recklessly
,
she
clung
to
*NL*
her
husband
's
arm
,
and
held
it
tight
as
though
her
clinging
could
*NL*
protect
him
from
any
harm
that
might
come
.
She
said
nothing
,
however
,
*NL*
till
the
narration
was
all
done
,
and
matters
had
been
brought
right
up
*NL*
to
the
present
time
.
Then
without
letting
go
her
husband
's
hand
she
*NL*
stood
up
amongst
us
and
spoke
.
Oh
,
that
I
could
give
any
idea
of
the
*NL*
scene
;
of
that
sweet
,
sweet
,
good
,
good
woman
in
all
the
radiant
beauty
*NL*
of
her
youth
and
animation
,
with
the
red
scar
on
her
forehead
,
of
which
*NL*
she
was
conscious
,
and
which
we
saw
with
grinding
of
our
*NL*
teeth
--
remembering
whence
and
how
it
came
;
her
loving
kindness
against
*NL*
our
grim
hate
;
her
tender
faith
against
all
our
fears
and
doubting
;
and
*NL*
we
,
knowing
that
so
far
as
symbols
went
,
she
with
all
her
goodness
and
*NL*
purity
and
faith
,
was
outcast
from
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jonathan
,
''
she
said
,
and
the
word
sounded
like
music
on
her
lips
it
was
*NL*
so
full
of
love
and
tenderness
,
``
Jonathan
dear
,
and
you
all
my
true
,
*NL*
true
friends
,
I
want
you
to
bear
something
in
mind
through
all
this
*NL*
dreadful
time
.
I
know
that
you
must
fight
--
that
you
must
destroy
even
as
*NL*
you
destroyed
the
false
Lucy
so
that
the
true
Lucy
might
live
hereafter
;
*NL*
but
it
is
not
a
work
of
hate
.
That
poor
soul
who
has
wrought
all
this
*NL*
misery
is
the
saddest
case
of
all
.
Just
think
what
will
be
his
joy
when
*NL*
he
,
too
,
is
destroyed
in
his
worser
part
that
his
better
part
may
have
*NL*
spiritual
immortality
.
You
must
be
pitiful
to
him
,
too
,
though
it
may
*NL*
not
hold
your
hands
from
his
destruction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
I
could
see
her
husband
's
face
darken
and
draw
together
,
as
*NL*
though
the
passion
in
him
were
shrivelling
his
being
to
its
core
.
*NL*
Instinctively
the
clasp
on
his
wife
's
hand
grew
closer
,
till
his
*NL*
knuckles
looked
white
.
She
did
not
flinch
from
the
pain
which
I
knew
she
*NL*
must
have
suffered
,
but
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
more
appealing
*NL*
than
ever
.
As
she
stopped
speaking
he
leaped
to
his
feet
,
almost
tearing
*NL*
his
hand
from
hers
as
he
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
God
give
him
into
my
hand
just
for
long
enough
to
destroy
that
*NL*
earthly
life
of
him
which
we
are
aiming
at
.
If
beyond
it
I
could
send
*NL*
his
soul
for
ever
and
ever
to
burning
hell
I
would
do
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hush
!
oh
,
hush
!
in
the
name
of
the
good
God
.
Do
n't
say
such
things
,
*NL*
Jonathan
,
my
husband
;
or
you
will
crush
me
with
fear
and
horror
.
Just
*NL*
think
,
my
dear
--
I
have
been
thinking
all
this
long
,
long
day
of
it
--
that
*NL*
...
perhaps
...
some
day
...
I
,
too
,
may
need
such
pity
;
and
that
some
*NL*
other
like
you
--
and
with
equal
cause
for
anger
--
may
deny
it
to
me
!
Oh
,
*NL*
my
husband
!
my
husband
,
indeed
I
would
have
spared
you
such
a
thought
*NL*
had
there
been
another
way
;
but
I
pray
that
God
may
not
have
treasured
*NL*
your
wild
words
,
except
as
the
heart-broken
wail
of
a
very
loving
and
*NL*
sorely
stricken
man
.
Oh
,
God
,
let
these
poor
white
hairs
go
in
evidence
*NL*
of
what
he
has
suffered
,
who
all
his
life
has
done
no
wrong
,
and
on
whom
*NL*
so
many
sorrows
have
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
men
were
all
in
tears
now
.
There
was
no
resisting
them
,
and
we
wept
*NL*
openly
.
She
wept
,
too
,
to
see
that
her
sweeter
counsels
had
prevailed
.
*NL*
Her
husband
flung
himself
on
his
knees
beside
her
,
and
putting
his
arms
*NL*
round
her
,
hid
his
face
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
.
Van
Helsing
beckoned
*NL*
to
us
and
we
stole
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
the
two
loving
hearts
alone
*NL*
with
their
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
retired
the
Professor
fixed
up
the
room
against
any
coming
*NL*
of
the
Vampire
,
and
assured
Mrs.
Harker
that
she
might
rest
in
peace
.
*NL*
She
tried
to
school
herself
to
the
belief
,
and
,
manifestly
for
her
*NL*
husband
's
sake
,
tried
to
seem
content
.
It
was
a
brave
struggle
;
and
was
,
*NL*
I
think
and
believe
,
not
without
its
reward
.
Van
Helsing
had
placed
at
*NL*
hand
a
bell
which
either
of
them
was
to
sound
in
case
of
any
emergency
.
*NL*
When
they
had
retired
,
Quincey
,
Godalming
,
and
I
arranged
that
we
should
*NL*
sit
up
,
dividing
the
night
between
us
,
and
watch
over
the
safety
of
the
*NL*
poor
stricken
lady
.
The
first
watch
falls
to
Quincey
,
so
the
rest
of
us
*NL*
shall
be
off
to
bed
as
soon
as
we
can
.
Godalming
has
already
turned
in
,
*NL*
for
his
is
the
second
watch
.
Now
that
my
work
is
done
I
,
too
,
shall
go
*NL*
to
bed
.

Jonathan
Harker
's
Journal
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
_
3-4
October
,
close
to
midnight
.
_
--
I
thought
yesterday
would
never
end
.
*NL*
There
was
over
me
a
yearning
for
sleep
,
in
some
sort
of
blind
belief
*NL*
that
to
wake
would
be
to
find
things
changed
,
and
that
any
change
must
*NL*
now
be
for
the
better
.
Before
we
parted
,
we
discussed
what
our
next
step
*NL*
was
to
be
,
but
we
could
arrive
at
no
result
.
All
we
knew
was
that
one
*NL*
earth-box
remained
,
and
that
the
Count
alone
knew
where
it
was
.
If
he
*NL*
chooses
to
lie
hidden
,
he
may
baffle
us
for
years
;
and
in
the
*NL*
meantime
!
--
the
thought
is
too
horrible
,
I
dare
not
think
of
it
even
now
.
*NL*
This
I
know
:
that
if
ever
there
was
a
woman
who
was
all
perfection
,
that
*NL*
one
is
my
poor
wronged
darling
.
I
love
her
a
thousand
times
more
for
her
*NL*
sweet
pity
of
last
night
,
a
pity
that
made
my
own
hate
of
the
monster
*NL*
seem
despicable
.
Surely
God
will
not
permit
the
world
to
be
the
poorer
*NL*
by
the
loss
of
such
a
creature
.
This
is
hope
to
me
.
We
are
all
drifting
*NL*
reefwards
now
,
and
faith
is
our
only
anchor
.
Thank
God
!
Mina
is
*NL*
sleeping
,
and
sleeping
without
dreams
.
I
fear
what
her
dreams
might
be
*NL*
like
,
with
such
terrible
memories
to
ground
them
in
.
She
has
not
been
so
*NL*
calm
,
within
my
seeing
,
since
the
sunset
.
Then
,
for
a
while
,
there
came
*NL*
over
her
face
a
repose
which
was
like
spring
after
the
blasts
of
March
.
*NL*
I
thought
at
the
time
that
it
was
the
softness
of
the
red
sunset
on
her
*NL*
face
,
but
somehow
now
I
think
it
has
a
deeper
meaning
.
I
am
not
sleepy
*NL*
myself
,
though
I
am
weary
--
weary
to
death
.
However
,
I
must
try
to
sleep
;
*NL*
for
there
is
to-morrow
to
think
of
,
and
there
is
no
rest
for
me
*NL*
until
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Later
.
_
--
I
must
have
fallen
asleep
,
for
I
was
awaked
by
Mina
,
who
was
*NL*
sitting
up
in
bed
,
with
a
startled
look
on
her
face
.
I
could
see
easily
,
*NL*
for
we
did
not
leave
the
room
in
darkness
;
she
had
placed
a
warning
hand
*NL*
over
my
mouth
,
and
now
she
whispered
in
my
ear
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
there
is
someone
in
the
corridor
!
''
I
got
up
softly
,
and
crossing
*NL*
the
room
,
gently
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
outside
,
stretched
on
a
mattress
,
lay
Mr.
Morris
,
wide
awake
.
He
*NL*
raised
a
warning
hand
for
silence
as
he
whispered
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
go
back
to
bed
;
it
is
all
right
.
One
of
us
will
be
here
all
*NL*
night
.
We
do
n't
mean
to
take
any
chances
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
look
and
gesture
forbade
discussion
,
so
I
came
back
and
told
Mina
.
*NL*
She
sighed
and
positively
a
shadow
of
a
smile
stole
over
her
poor
,
pale
*NL*
face
as
she
put
her
arms
round
me
and
said
softly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
God
for
good
brave
men
!
''
With
a
sigh
she
sank
back
again
to
*NL*
sleep
.
I
write
this
now
as
I
am
not
sleepy
,
though
I
must
try
again
.

_
4
October
,
morning
.
_
--
Once
again
during
the
night
I
was
wakened
by
*NL*
Mina
.
This
time
we
had
all
had
a
good
sleep
,
for
the
grey
of
the
coming
*NL*
dawn
was
making
the
windows
into
sharp
oblongs
,
and
the
gas
flame
was
*NL*
like
a
speck
rather
than
a
disc
of
light
.
She
said
to
me
hurriedly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
call
the
Professor
.
I
want
to
see
him
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
an
idea
.
I
suppose
it
must
have
come
in
the
night
,
and
matured
*NL*
without
my
knowing
it
.
He
must
hypnotise
me
before
the
dawn
,
and
then
I
*NL*
shall
be
able
to
speak
.
Go
quick
,
dearest
;
the
time
is
getting
close
.
''
I
*NL*
went
to
the
door
.
Dr.
Seward
was
resting
on
the
mattress
,
and
,
seeing
*NL*
me
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
anything
wrong
?
''
he
asked
,
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
replied
;
``
but
Mina
wants
to
see
Dr.
Van
Helsing
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
,
''
he
said
,
and
hurried
into
the
Professor
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
two
or
three
minutes
later
Van
Helsing
was
in
the
room
in
his
*NL*
dressing-gown
,
and
Mr.
Morris
and
Lord
Godalming
were
with
Dr.
Seward
at
*NL*
the
door
asking
questions
.
When
the
Professor
saw
Mina
a
smile
--
a
*NL*
positive
smile
ousted
the
anxiety
of
his
face
;
he
rubbed
his
hands
as
he
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
Madam
Mina
,
this
is
indeed
a
change
.
See
!
friend
Jonathan
,
*NL*
we
have
got
our
dear
Madam
Mina
,
as
of
old
,
back
to
us
to-day
!
''
Then
*NL*
turning
to
her
,
he
said
,
cheerfully
:
``
And
what
am
I
do
for
you
?
For
at
*NL*
this
hour
you
do
not
want
me
for
nothings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
hypnotise
me
!
''
she
said
.
``
Do
it
before
the
dawn
,
for
I
*NL*
feel
that
then
I
can
speak
,
and
speak
freely
.
Be
quick
,
for
the
time
is
*NL*
short
!
''
Without
a
word
he
motioned
her
to
sit
up
in
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
fixedly
at
her
,
he
commenced
to
make
passes
in
front
of
her
,
*NL*
from
over
the
top
of
her
head
downward
,
with
each
hand
in
turn
.
Mina
*NL*
gazed
at
him
fixedly
for
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
my
own
heart
beat
*NL*
like
a
trip
hammer
,
for
I
felt
that
some
crisis
was
at
hand
.
Gradually
*NL*
her
eyes
closed
,
and
she
sat
,
stock
still
;
only
by
the
gentle
heaving
of
*NL*
her
bosom
could
one
know
that
she
was
alive
.
The
Professor
made
a
few
*NL*
more
passes
and
then
stopped
,
and
I
could
see
that
his
forehead
was
*NL*
covered
with
great
beads
of
perspiration
.
Mina
opened
her
eyes
;
but
she
*NL*
did
not
seem
the
same
woman
.
There
was
a
far-away
look
in
her
eyes
,
and
*NL*
her
voice
had
a
sad
dreaminess
which
was
new
to
me
.
Raising
his
hand
to
*NL*
impose
silence
,
the
Professor
motioned
to
me
to
bring
the
others
in
.
*NL*
They
came
on
tip-toe
,
closing
the
door
behind
them
,
and
stood
at
the
*NL*
foot
of
the
bed
,
looking
on
.
Mina
appeared
not
to
see
them
.
The
*NL*
stillness
was
broken
by
Van
Helsing
's
voice
speaking
in
a
low
level
tone
*NL*
which
would
not
break
the
current
of
her
thoughts
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
?
''
The
answer
came
in
a
neutral
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
.
Sleep
has
no
place
it
can
call
its
own
.
''
For
several
*NL*
minutes
there
was
silence
.
Mina
sat
rigid
,
and
the
Professor
stood
*NL*
staring
at
her
fixedly
;
the
rest
of
us
hardly
dared
to
breathe
.
The
room
*NL*
was
growing
lighter
;
without
taking
his
eyes
from
Mina
's
face
,
Dr.
Van
*NL*
Helsing
motioned
me
to
pull
up
the
blind
.
I
did
so
,
and
the
day
seemed
*NL*
just
upon
us
.
A
red
streak
shot
up
,
and
a
rosy
light
seemed
to
diffuse
*NL*
itself
through
the
room
.
On
the
instant
the
Professor
spoke
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
now
?
''
The
answer
came
dreamily
,
but
with
intention
;
it
*NL*
were
as
though
she
were
interpreting
something
.
I
have
heard
her
use
the
*NL*
same
tone
when
reading
her
shorthand
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
.
It
is
all
strange
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
see
nothing
;
it
is
all
dark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
hear
?
''
I
could
detect
the
strain
in
the
Professor
's
patient
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lapping
of
water
.
It
is
gurgling
by
,
and
little
waves
leap
.
I
can
*NL*
hear
them
on
the
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
on
a
ship
?
''
We
all
looked
at
each
other
,
trying
to
glean
*NL*
something
each
from
the
other
.
We
were
afraid
to
think
.
The
answer
came
*NL*
quick
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sound
of
men
stamping
overhead
as
they
run
about
.
There
is
the
*NL*
creaking
of
a
chain
,
and
the
loud
tinkle
as
the
check
of
the
capstan
*NL*
falls
into
the
rachet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
still
--
oh
,
so
still
.
It
is
like
death
!
''
The
voice
faded
away
into
*NL*
a
deep
breath
as
of
one
sleeping
,
and
the
open
eyes
closed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
sun
had
risen
,
and
we
were
all
in
the
full
light
of
*NL*
day
.
Dr.
Van
Helsing
placed
his
hands
on
Mina
's
shoulders
,
and
laid
her
*NL*
head
down
softly
on
her
pillow
.
She
lay
like
a
sleeping
child
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
and
then
,
with
a
long
sigh
,
awoke
and
stared
in
wonder
to
see
*NL*
us
all
around
her
.
``
Have
I
been
talking
in
my
sleep
?
''
was
all
she
said
.
*NL*
She
seemed
,
however
,
to
know
the
situation
without
telling
,
though
she
*NL*
was
eager
to
know
what
she
had
told
.
The
Professor
repeated
the
*NL*
conversation
,
and
she
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
:
it
may
not
be
yet
too
late
!
''
Mr.
*NL*
Morris
and
Lord
Godalming
started
for
the
door
but
the
Professor
's
calm
*NL*
voice
called
them
back
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
my
friends
.
That
ship
,
wherever
it
was
,
was
weighing
anchor
*NL*
whilst
she
spoke
.
There
are
many
ships
weighing
anchor
at
the
moment
in
*NL*
your
so
great
Port
of
London
.
Which
of
them
is
it
that
you
seek
?
God
be
*NL*
thanked
that
we
have
once
again
a
clue
,
though
whither
it
may
lead
us
we
*NL*
know
not
.
We
have
been
blind
somewhat
;
blind
after
the
manner
of
men
,
*NL*
since
when
we
can
look
back
we
see
what
we
might
have
seen
looking
*NL*
forward
if
we
had
been
able
to
see
what
we
might
have
seen
!
Alas
,
but
*NL*
that
sentence
is
a
puddle
;
is
it
not
?
We
can
know
now
what
was
in
the
*NL*
Count
's
mind
,
when
he
seize
that
money
,
though
Jonathan
's
so
fierce
*NL*
knife
put
him
in
the
danger
that
even
he
dread
.
He
meant
escape
.
Hear
*NL*
me
,
ESCAPE
!
He
saw
that
with
but
one
earth-box
left
,
and
a
pack
of
men
*NL*
following
like
dogs
after
a
fox
,
this
London
was
no
place
for
him
.
He
*NL*
have
take
his
last
earth-box
on
board
a
ship
,
and
he
leave
the
land
.
He
*NL*
think
to
escape
,
but
no
!
we
follow
him
.
Tally
Ho
!
as
friend
Arthur
would
*NL*
say
when
he
put
on
his
red
frock
!
Our
old
fox
is
wily
;
oh
!
so
wily
,
and
*NL*
we
must
follow
with
wile
.
I
,
too
,
am
wily
and
I
think
his
mind
in
a
*NL*
little
while
.
In
meantime
we
may
rest
and
in
peace
,
for
there
are
waters
*NL*
between
us
which
he
do
not
want
to
pass
,
and
which
he
could
not
if
he
*NL*
would
--
unless
the
ship
were
to
touch
the
land
,
and
then
only
at
full
or
*NL*
slack
tide
.
See
,
and
the
sun
is
just
rose
,
and
all
day
to
sunset
is
to
*NL*
us
.
Let
us
take
bath
,
and
dress
,
and
have
breakfast
which
we
all
need
,
*NL*
and
which
we
can
eat
comfortably
since
he
be
not
in
the
same
land
with
*NL*
us
.
''
Mina
looked
at
him
appealingly
as
she
asked
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
need
we
seek
him
further
,
when
he
is
gone
away
from
us
?
''
He
*NL*
took
her
hand
and
patted
it
as
he
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
me
nothings
as
yet
.
When
we
have
breakfast
,
then
I
answer
all
*NL*
questions
.
''
He
would
say
no
more
,
and
we
separated
to
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
Mina
repeated
her
question
.
He
looked
at
her
gravely
for
*NL*
a
minute
and
then
said
sorrowfully
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
my
dear
,
dear
Madam
Mina
,
now
more
than
ever
must
we
find
him
*NL*
even
if
we
have
to
follow
him
to
the
jaws
of
Hell
!
''
She
grew
paler
as
*NL*
she
asked
faintly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
he
answered
solemnly
,
``
he
can
live
for
centuries
,
and
you
are
*NL*
but
mortal
woman
.
Time
is
now
to
be
dreaded
--
since
once
he
put
that
mark
*NL*
upon
your
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
just
in
time
to
catch
her
as
she
fell
forward
in
a
faint
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
DR.
SEWARD
'S
PHONOGRAPH
DIARY
,
SPOKEN
BY
VAN
HELSING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
to
Jonathan
Harker
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
to
stay
with
your
dear
Madam
Mina
.
We
shall
go
to
make
our
*NL*
search
--
if
I
can
call
it
so
,
for
it
is
not
search
but
knowing
,
and
we
*NL*
seek
confirmation
only
.
But
do
you
stay
and
take
care
of
her
to-day
.
*NL*
This
is
your
best
and
most
holiest
office
.
This
day
nothing
can
find
him
*NL*
here
.
Let
me
tell
you
that
so
you
will
know
what
we
four
know
already
,
*NL*
for
I
have
tell
them
.
He
,
our
enemy
,
have
gone
away
;
he
have
gone
back
*NL*
to
his
Castle
in
Transylvania
.
I
know
it
so
well
,
as
if
a
great
hand
of
*NL*
fire
wrote
it
on
the
wall
.
He
have
prepare
for
this
in
some
way
,
and
*NL*
that
last
earth-box
was
ready
to
ship
somewheres
.
For
this
he
took
the
*NL*
money
;
for
this
he
hurry
at
the
last
,
lest
we
catch
him
before
the
sun
*NL*
go
down
.
It
was
his
last
hope
,
save
that
he
might
hide
in
the
tomb
that
*NL*
he
think
poor
Miss
Lucy
,
being
as
he
thought
like
him
,
keep
open
to
him
.
*NL*
But
there
was
not
of
time
.
When
that
fail
he
make
straight
for
his
last
*NL*
resource
--
his

*NL*
He
is
clever
,
oh
,
so
clever
!
he
know
that
his
game
here
was
finish
;
and
*NL*
so
he
decide
he
go
back
home
.
He
find
ship
going
by
the
route
he
came
,
*NL*
and
he
go
in
it
.
We
go
off
now
to
find
what
ship
,
and
whither
bound
;
*NL*
when
we
have
discover
that
,
we
come
back
and
tell
you
all
.
Then
we
will
*NL*
comfort
you
and
poor
dear
Madam
Mina
with
new
hope
.
For
it
will
be
hope
*NL*
when
you
think
it
over
:
that
all
is
not
lost
.
This
very
creature
that
we
*NL*
pursue
,
he
take
hundreds
of
years
to
get
so
far
as
London
;
and
yet
in
*NL*
one
day
,
when
we
know
of
the
disposal
of
him
we
drive
him
out
.
He
is
*NL*
finite
,
though
he
is
powerful
to
do
much
harm
and
suffers
not
as
we
do
.
*NL*
But
we
are
strong
,
each
in
our
purpose
;
and
we
are
all
more
strong
*NL*
together
.
Take
heart
afresh
,
dear
husband
of
Madam
Mina
.
This
battle
is
*NL*
but
begun
,
and
in
the
end
we
shall
win
--
so
sure
as
that
God
sits
on
high
*NL*
to
watch
over
His
children
.
Therefore
be
of
much
comfort
till
we
return

When
I
read
to
Mina
,
Van
Helsing
's
message
in
the
*NL*
phonograph
,
the
poor
girl
brightened
up
considerably
.
Already
the
*NL*
certainty
that
the
Count
is
out
of
the
country
has
given
her
comfort
;
*NL*
and
comfort
is
strength
to
her
.
For
my
own
part
,
now
that
his
horrible
*NL*
danger
is
not
face
to
face
with
us
,
it
seems
almost
impossible
to
*NL*
believe
in
it
.
Even
my
own
terrible
experiences
in
Castle
Dracula
seem
*NL*
like
a
long-forgotten
dream
.
Here
in
the
crisp
autumn
air
in
the
bright
*NL*
sunlight
--
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
how
can
I
disbelieve
!
In
the
midst
of
my
thought
my
eye
fell
on
*NL*
the
red
scar
on
my
poor
darling
's
white
forehead
.
Whilst
that
lasts
,
*NL*
there
can
be
no
disbelief
.
And
afterwards
the
very
memory
of
it
will
*NL*
keep
faith
crystal
clear
.
Mina
and
I
fear
to
be
idle
,
so
we
have
been
*NL*
over
all
the
diaries
again
and
again
.
Somehow
,
although
the
reality
*NL*
seems
greater
each
time
,
the
pain
and
the
fear
seem
less
.
There
is
*NL*
something
of
a
guiding
purpose
manifest
throughout
,
which
is
comforting
.
*NL*
Mina
says
that
perhaps
we
are
the
instruments
of
ultimate
good
.
It
may
*NL*
be
!
I
shall
try
to
think
as
she
does
.
We
have
never
spoken
to
each
other
*NL*
yet
of
the
future
.
It
is
better
to
wait
till
we
see
the
Professor
and
*NL*
the
others
after
their
investigations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
is
running
by
more
quickly
than
I
ever
thought
a
day
could
run
*NL*
for
me
again
.
It
is
now
three
o'clock

Our
meeting
for
report
.
Present
:
Professor
Van
*NL*
Helsing
,
Lord
Godalming
,
Dr.
Seward
,
Mr.
Quincey
Morris
,
Jonathan
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Van
Helsing
described
what
steps
were
taken
during
the
day
to
*NL*
discover
on
what
boat
and
whither
bound
Count
Dracula
made
his
escape
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
knew
that
he
wanted
to
get
back
to
Transylvania
,
I
felt
sure
that
*NL*
he
must
go
by
the
Danube
mouth
;
or
by
somewhere
in
the
Black
Sea
,
since
*NL*
by
that
way
he
come
.
It
was
a
dreary
blank
that
was
before
us
.
_
Omne
*NL*
ignotum
pro
magnifico
_
;
and
so
with
heavy
hearts
we
start
to
find
what
*NL*
ships
leave
for
the
Black
Sea
last
night
.
He
was
in
sailing
ship
,
since
*NL*
Madam
Mina
tell
of
sails
being
set
.
These
not
so
important
as
to
go
in
*NL*
your
list
of
the
shipping
in
the
_
Times
_
,
and
so
we
go
,
by
suggestion
of
*NL*
Lord
Godalming
,
to
your
Lloyd
's
,
where
are
note
of
all
ships
that
sail
,
*NL*
however
so
small
.
There
we
find
that
only
one
Black-Sea-bound
ship
go
*NL*
out
with
the
tide
.
She
is
the
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
,
and
she
sail
from
*NL*
Doolittle
's
Wharf
for
Varna
,
and
thence
on
to
other
parts
and
up
the
*NL*
Danube
.
`
Soh
!
'
said
I
,
`
this
is
the
ship
whereon
is
the
Count
.
'
So
off
*NL*
we
go
to
Doolittle
's
Wharf
,
and
there
we
find
a
man
in
an
office
of
wood
*NL*
so
small
that
the
man
look
bigger
than
the
office
.
From
him
we
inquire
*NL*
of
the
goings
of
the
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
.
He
swear
much
,
and
he
red
face
*NL*
and
loud
of
voice
,
but
he
good
fellow
all
the
same
;
and
when
Quincey
*NL*
give
him
something
from
his
pocket
which
crackle
as
he
roll
it
up
,
and
*NL*
put
it
in
a
so
small
bag
which
he
have
hid
deep
in
his
clothing
,
he
*NL*
still
better
fellow
and
humble
servant
to
us
.
He
come
with
us
,
and
ask
*NL*
many
men
who
are
rough
and
hot
;
these
be
better
fellows
too
when
they
*NL*
have
been
no
more
thirsty
.
They
say
much
of
blood
and
bloom
,
and
of
*NL*
others
which
I
comprehend
not
,
though
I
guess
what
they
mean
;
but
*NL*
nevertheless
they
tell
us
all
things
which
we
want
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
make
known
to
us
among
them
,
how
last
afternoon
at
about
five
*NL*
o'clock
comes
a
man
so
hurry
.
A
tall
man
,
thin
and
pale
,
with
high
nose
*NL*
and
teeth
so
white
,
and
eyes
that
seem
to
be
burning
.
That
he
be
all
in
*NL*
black
,
except
that
he
have
a
hat
of
straw
which
suit
not
him
or
the
*NL*
time
.
That
he
scatter
his
money
in
making
quick
inquiry
as
to
what
ship
*NL*
sails
for
the
Black
Sea
and
for
where
.
Some
took
him
to
the
office
and
*NL*
then
to
the
ship
,
where
he
will
not
go
aboard
but
halt
at
shore
end
of
*NL*
gang-plank
,
and
ask
that
the
captain
come
to
him
.
The
captain
come
,
when
*NL*
told
that
he
will
be
pay
well
;
and
though
he
swear
much
at
the
first
he
*NL*
agree
to
term
.
Then
the
thin
man
go
and
some
one
tell
him
where
horse
*NL*
and
cart
can
be
hired
.
He
go
there
and
soon
he
come
again
,
himself
*NL*
driving
cart
on
which
a
great
box
;
this
he
himself
lift
down
,
though
it
*NL*
take
several
to
put
it
on
truck
for
the
ship
.
He
give
much
talk
to
*NL*
captain
as
to
how
and
where
his
box
is
to
be
place
;
but
the
captain
like
*NL*
it
not
and
swear
at
him
in
many
tongues
,
and
tell
him
that
if
he
like
he
*NL*
can
come
and
see
where
it
shall
be
.
But
he
say
`
no
'
;
that
he
come
not
*NL*
yet
,
for
that
he
have
much
to
do
.
Whereupon
the
captain
tell
him
that
he
*NL*
had
better
be
quick
--
with
blood
--
for
that
his
ship
will
leave
the
*NL*
place
--
of
blood
--
before
the
turn
of
the
tide
--
with
blood
.
Then
the
thin
*NL*
man
smile
and
say
that
of
course
he
must
go
when
he
think
fit
;
but
he
*NL*
will
be
surprise
if
he
go
quite
so
soon
.
The
captain
swear
again
,
*NL*
polyglot
,
and
the
thin
man
make
him
bow
,
and
thank
him
,
and
say
that
he
*NL*
will
so
far
intrude
on
his
kindness
as
to
come
aboard
before
the
*NL*
sailing
.
Final
the
captain
,
more
red
than
ever
,
and
in
more
tongues
tell
*NL*
him
that
he
does
n't
want
no
Frenchmen
--
with
bloom
upon
them
and
also
*NL*
with
blood
--
in
his
ship
--
with
blood
on
her
also
.
And
so
,
after
asking
*NL*
where
there
might
be
close
at
hand
a
ship
where
he
might
purchase
ship
*NL*
forms
,
he
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
knew
where
he
went
`
or
bloomin
'
well
cared
,
'
as
they
said
,
for
*NL*
they
had
something
else
to
think
of
--
well
with
blood
again
;
for
it
soon
*NL*
became
apparent
to
all
that
the
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
would
not
sail
as
*NL*
was
expected
.
A
thin
mist
began
to
creep
up
from
the
river
,
and
it
grew
,
*NL*
and
grew
;
till
soon
a
dense
fog
enveloped
the
ship
and
all
around
her
.
*NL*
The
captain
swore
polyglot
--
very
polyglot
--
polyglot
with
bloom
and
*NL*
blood
;
but
he
could
do
nothing
.
The
water
rose
and
rose
;
and
he
began
to
*NL*
fear
that
he
would
lose
the
tide
altogether
.
He
was
in
no
friendly
mood
,
*NL*
when
just
at
full
tide
,
the
thin
man
came
up
the
gang-plank
again
and
*NL*
asked
to
see
where
his
box
had
been
stowed
.
Then
the
captain
replied
*NL*
that
he
wished
that
he
and
his
box
--
old
and
with
much
bloom
and
*NL*
blood
--
were
in
hell
.
But
the
thin
man
did
not
be
offend
,
and
went
down
*NL*
with
the
mate
and
saw
where
it
was
place
,
and
came
up
and
stood
awhile
*NL*
on
deck
in
fog
.
He
must
have
come
off
by
himself
,
for
none
notice
him
.
*NL*
Indeed
they
thought
not
of
him
;
for
soon
the
fog
begin
to
melt
away
,
and
*NL*
all
was
clear
again
.
My
friends
of
the
thirst
and
the
language
that
was
*NL*
of
bloom
and
blood
laughed
,
as
they
told
how
the
captain
's
swears
*NL*
exceeded
even
his
usual
polyglot
,
and
was
more
than
ever
full
of
*NL*
picturesque
,
when
on
questioning
other
mariners
who
were
on
movement
up
*NL*
and
down
on
the
river
that
hour
,
he
found
that
few
of
them
had
seen
any
*NL*
of
fog
at
all
,
except
where
it
lay
round
the
wharf
.
However
,
the
ship
*NL*
went
out
on
the
ebb
tide
;
and
was
doubtless
by
morning
far
down
the
*NL*
river
mouth
.
She
was
by
then
,
when
they
told
us
,
well
out
to
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
my
dear
Madam
Mina
,
it
is
that
we
have
to
rest
for
a
time
,
for
*NL*
our
enemy
is
on
the
sea
,
with
the
fog
at
his
command
,
on
his
way
to
the
*NL*
Danube
mouth
.
To
sail
a
ship
takes
time
,
go
she
never
so
quick
;
and
when
*NL*
we
start
we
go
on
land
more
quick
,
and
we
meet
him
there
.
Our
best
hope
*NL*
is
to
come
on
him
when
in
the
box
between
sunrise
and
sunset
;
for
then
*NL*
he
can
make
no
struggle
,
and
we
may
deal
with
him
as
we
should
.
There
*NL*
are
days
for
us
,
in
which
we
can
make
ready
our
plan
.
We
know
all
about
*NL*
where
he
go
;
for
we
have
seen
the
owner
of
the
ship
,
who
have
shown
us
*NL*
invoices
and
all
papers
that
can
be
.
The
box
we
seek
is
to
be
landed
in
*NL*
Varna
,
and
to
be
given
to
an
agent
,
one
Ristics
who
will
there
present
*NL*
his
credentials
;
and
so
our
merchant
friend
will
have
done
his
part
.
*NL*
When
he
ask
if
there
be
any
wrong
,
for
that
so
,
he
can
telegraph
and
*NL*
have
inquiry
made
at
Varna
,
we
say
`
no
'
;
for
what
is
to
be
done
is
not
*NL*
for
police
or
of
the
customs
.
It
must
be
done
by
us
alone
and
in
our
own
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dr.
Van
Helsing
had
done
speaking
,
I
asked
him
if
he
were
certain
*NL*
that
the
Count
had
remained
on
board
the
ship
.
He
replied
:
``
We
have
the
*NL*
best
proof
of
that
:
your
own
evidence
,
when
in
the
hypnotic
trance
this
*NL*
morning
.
''
I
asked
him
again
if
it
were
really
necessary
that
they
should
*NL*
pursue
the
Count
,
for
oh
!
I
dread
Jonathan
leaving
me
,
and
I
know
that
*NL*
he
would
surely
go
if
the
others
went
.
He
answered
in
growing
passion
,
*NL*
at
first
quietly
.
As
he
went
on
,
however
,
he
grew
more
angry
and
more
*NL*
forceful
,
till
in
the
end
we
could
not
but
see
wherein
was
at
least
some
*NL*
of
that
personal
dominance
which
made
him
so
long
a
master
amongst
*NL*
men
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
necessary
--
necessary
--
necessary
!
For
your
sake
in
the
first
,
*NL*
and
then
for
the
sake
of
humanity
.
This
monster
has
done
much
harm
*NL*
already
,
in
the
narrow
scope
where
he
find
himself
,
and
in
the
short
*NL*
time
when
as
yet
he
was
only
as
a
body
groping
his
so
small
measure
in
*NL*
darkness
and
not
knowing
.
All
this
have
I
told
these
others
;
you
,
my
*NL*
dear
Madam
Mina
,
will
learn
it
in
the
phonograph
of
my
friend
John
,
or
*NL*
in
that
of
your
husband
.
I
have
told
them
how
the
measure
of
leaving
his
*NL*
own
barren
land
--
barren
of
peoples
--
and
coming
to
a
new
land
where
life
*NL*
of
man
teems
till
they
are
like
the
multitude
of
standing
corn
,
was
the
*NL*
work
of
centuries
.
Were
another
of
the
Un-Dead
,
like
him
,
to
try
to
do
*NL*
what
he
has
done
,
perhaps
not
all
the
centuries
of
the
world
that
have
*NL*
been
,
or
that
will
be
,
could
aid
him
.
With
this
one
,
all
the
forces
of
*NL*
nature
that
are
occult
and
deep
and
strong
must
have
worked
together
in
*NL*
some
wondrous
way
.
The
very
place
,
where
he
have
been
alive
,
Un-Dead
for
*NL*
all
these
centuries
,
is
full
of
strangeness
of
the
geologic
and
chemical
*NL*
world
.
There
are
deep
caverns
and
fissures
that
reach
none
know
whither
.
*NL*
There
have
been
volcanoes
,
some
of
whose
openings
still
send
out
waters
*NL*
of
strange
properties
,
and
gases
that
kill
or
make
to
vivify
.
Doubtless
,
*NL*
there
is
something
magnetic
or
electric
in
some
of
these
combinations
of
*NL*
occult
forces
which
work
for
physical
life
in
strange
way
;
and
in
*NL*
himself
were
from
the
first
some
great
qualities
.
In
a
hard
and
warlike
*NL*
time
he
was
celebrate
that
he
have
more
iron
nerve
,
more
subtle
brain
,
*NL*
more
braver
heart
,
than
any
man
.
In
him
some
vital
principle
have
in
*NL*
strange
way
found
their
utmost
;
and
as
his
body
keep
strong
and
grow
and
*NL*
thrive
,
so
his
brain
grow
too
.
All
this
without
that
diabolic
aid
which
*NL*
is
surely
to
him
;
for
it
have
to
yield
to
the
powers
that
come
from
,
*NL*
and
are
,
symbolic
of
good
.
And
now
this
is
what
he
is
to
us
.
He
have
*NL*
infect
you
--
oh
,
forgive
me
,
my
dear
,
that
I
must
say
such
;
but
it
is
for
*NL*
good
of
you
that
I
speak
.
He
infect
you
in
such
wise
,
that
even
if
he
do
*NL*
no
more
,
you
have
only
to
live
--
to
live
in
your
own
old
,
sweet
way
;
and
*NL*
so
in
time
,
death
,
which
is
of
man
's
common
lot
and
with
God
's
sanction
,
*NL*
shall
make
you
like
to
him
.
This
must
not
be
!
We
have
sworn
together
*NL*
that
it
must
not
.
Thus
are
we
ministers
of
God
's
own
wish
:
that
the
*NL*
world
,
and
men
for
whom
His
Son
die
,
will
not
be
given
over
to
monsters
,
*NL*
whose
very
existence
would
defame
Him
.
He
have
allowed
us
to
redeem
one
*NL*
soul
already
,
and
we
go
out
as
the
old
knights
of
the
Cross
to
redeem
*NL*
more
.
Like
them
we
shall
travel
towards
the
sunrise
;
and
like
them
,
if
*NL*
we
fall
,
we
fall
in
good
cause
.
''
He
paused
and
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
will
not
the
Count
take
his
rebuff
wisely
?
Since
he
has
been
driven
*NL*
from
England
,
will
he
not
avoid
it
,
as
a
tiger
does
the
village
from
*NL*
which
he
has
been
hunted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
''
he
said
,
``
your
simile
of
the
tiger
good
,
for
me
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
adopt
him
.
Your
man-eater
,
as
they
of
India
call
the
tiger
who
has
once
*NL*
tasted
blood
of
the
human
,
care
no
more
for
the
other
prey
,
but
prowl
*NL*
unceasing
till
he
get
him
.
This
that
we
hunt
from
our
village
is
a
*NL*
tiger
,
too
,
a
man-eater
,
and
he
never
cease
to
prowl
.
Nay
,
in
himself
he
*NL*
is
not
one
to
retire
and
stay
afar
.
In
his
life
,
his
living
life
,
he
go
*NL*
over
the
Turkey
frontier
and
attack
his
enemy
on
his
own
ground
;
he
be
*NL*
beaten
back
,
but
did
he
stay
?
No
!
He
come
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
.
*NL*
Look
at
his
persistence
and
endurance
.
With
the
child-brain
that
was
to
*NL*
him
he
have
long
since
conceive
the
idea
of
coming
to
a
great
city
.
What
*NL*
does
he
do
?
He
find
out
the
place
of
all
the
world
most
of
promise
for
*NL*
him
.
Then
he
deliberately
set
himself
down
to
prepare
for
the
task
.
He
*NL*
find
in
patience
just
how
is
his
strength
,
and
what
are
his
powers
.
He
*NL*
study
new
tongues
.
He
learn
new
social
life
;
new
environment
of
old
*NL*
ways
,
the
politic
,
the
law
,
the
finance
,
the
science
,
the
habit
of
a
new
*NL*
land
and
a
new
people
who
have
come
to
be
since
he
was
.
His
glimpse
that
*NL*
he
have
had
,
whet
his
appetite
only
and
enkeen
his
desire
.
Nay
,
it
help
*NL*
him
to
grow
as
to
his
brain
;
for
it
all
prove
to
him
how
right
he
was
at
*NL*
the
first
in
his
surmises
.
He
have
done
this
alone
;
all
alone
!
from
a
*NL*
ruin
tomb
in
a
forgotten
land
.
What
more
may
he
not
do
when
the
greater
*NL*
world
of
thought
is
open
to
him
.
He
that
can
smile
at
death
,
as
we
know
*NL*
him
;
who
can
flourish
in
the
midst
of
diseases
that
kill
off
whole
*NL*
peoples
.
Oh
,
if
such
an
one
was
to
come
from
God
,
and
not
the
Devil
,
*NL*
what
a
force
for
good
might
he
not
be
in
this
old
world
of
ours
.
But
we
*NL*
are
pledged
to
set
the
world
free
.
Our
toil
must
be
in
silence
,
and
our
*NL*
efforts
all
in
secret
;
for
in
this
enlightened
age
,
when
men
believe
not
*NL*
even
what
they
see
,
the
doubting
of
wise
men
would
be
his
greatest
*NL*
strength
.
It
would
be
at
once
his
sheath
and
his
armour
,
and
his
weapons
*NL*
to
destroy
us
,
his
enemies
,
who
are
willing
to
peril
even
our
own
souls
*NL*
for
the
safety
of
one
we
love
--
for
the
good
of
mankind
,
and
for
the
*NL*
honour
and
glory
of
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
general
discussion
it
was
determined
that
for
to-night
nothing
*NL*
be
definitely
settled
;
that
we
should
all
sleep
on
the
facts
,
and
try
to
*NL*
think
out
the
proper
conclusions
.
To-morrow
,
at
breakfast
,
we
are
to
*NL*
meet
again
,
and
,
after
making
our
conclusions
known
to
one
another
,
we
*NL*
shall
decide
on
some
definite
cause
of
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*

*
*NL*
*NL*
I
feel
a
wonderful
peace
and
rest
to-night
.
It
is
as
if
some
haunting
*NL*
presence
were
removed
from
me
.
Perhaps
...
*NL*
*NL*
My
surmise
was
not
finished
,
could
not
be
;
for
I
caught
sight
in
the
*NL*
mirror
of
the
red
mark
upon
my
forehead
;
and
I
knew
that
I
was
still
*NL*
unclean

5
October
.
_
--
We
all
rose
early
,
and
I
think
that
sleep
did
much
for
*NL*
each
and
all
of
us
.
When
we
met
at
early
breakfast
there
was
more
*NL*
general
cheerfulness
than
any
of
us
had
ever
expected
to
experience
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
really
wonderful
how
much
resilience
there
is
in
human
nature
.
Let
*NL*
any
obstructing
cause
,
no
matter
what
,
be
removed
in
any
way
--
even
by
*NL*
death
--
and
we
fly
back
to
first
principles
of
hope
and
enjoyment
.
More
*NL*
than
once
as
we
sat
around
the
table
,
my
eyes
opened
in
wonder
whether
*NL*
the
whole
of
the
past
days
had
not
been
a
dream
.
It
was
only
when
I
*NL*
caught
sight
of
the
red
blotch
on
Mrs.
Harker
's
forehead
that
I
was
*NL*
brought
back
to
reality
.
Even
now
,
when
I
am
gravely
revolving
the
*NL*
matter
,
it
is
almost
impossible
to
realise
that
the
cause
of
all
our
*NL*
trouble
is
still
existent
.
Even
Mrs.
Harker
seems
to
lose
sight
of
her
*NL*
trouble
for
whole
spells
;
it
is
only
now
and
again
,
when
something
*NL*
recalls
it
to
her
mind
,
that
she
thinks
of
her
terrible
scar
.
We
are
to
*NL*
meet
here
in
my
study
in
half
an
hour
and
decide
on
our
course
of
*NL*
action
.
I
see
only
one
immediate
difficulty
,
I
know
it
by
instinct
*NL*
rather
than
reason
:
we
shall
all
have
to
speak
frankly
;
and
yet
I
fear
*NL*
that
in
some
mysterious
way
poor
Mrs.
Harker
's
tongue
is
tied
.
I
_
know
_
*NL*
that
she
forms
conclusions
of
her
own
,
and
from
all
that
has
been
I
can
*NL*
guess
how
brilliant
and
how
true
they
must
be
;
but
she
will
not
,
or
*NL*
can
not
,
give
them
utterance
.
I
have
mentioned
this
to
Van
Helsing
,
and
*NL*
he
and
I
are
to
talk
it
over
when
we
are
alone
.
I
suppose
it
is
some
of
*NL*
that
horrid
poison
which
has
got
into
her
veins
beginning
to
work
.
The
*NL*
Count
had
his
own
purposes
when
he
gave
her
what
Van
Helsing
called
``
the
*NL*
Vampire
's
baptism
of
blood
.
''
Well
,
there
may
be
a
poison
that
distils
*NL*
itself
out
of
good
things
;
in
an
age
when
the
existence
of
ptomaines
is
*NL*
a
mystery
we
should
not
wonder
at
anything
!
One
thing
I
know
:
that
if
my
*NL*
instinct
be
true
regarding
poor
Mrs.
Harker
's
silences
,
then
there
is
a
*NL*
terrible
difficulty
--
an
unknown
danger
--
in
the
work
before
us
.
The
same
*NL*
power
that
compels
her
silence
may
compel
her
speech
.
I
dare
not
think
*NL*
further
;
for
so
I
should
in
my
thoughts
dishonour
a
noble
woman
!
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
is
coming
to
my
study
a
little
before
the
others
.
I
shall
*NL*
try
to
open
the
subject
with
him
.

*NL*
_
Later
.
_
--
When
the
Professor
came
in
,
we
talked
over
the
state
of
*NL*
things
.
I
could
see
that
he
had
something
on
his
mind
which
he
wanted
to
*NL*
say
,
but
felt
some
hesitancy
about
broaching
the
subject
.
After
beating
*NL*
about
the
bush
a
little
,
he
said
suddenly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
John
,
there
is
something
that
you
and
I
must
talk
of
alone
,
just
*NL*
at
the
first
at
any
rate
.
Later
,
we
may
have
to
take
the
others
into
our
*NL*
confidence
''
;
then
he
stopped
,
so
I
waited
;
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
Mina
,
our
poor
,
dear
Madam
Mina
is
changing
.
''
A
cold
shiver
ran
*NL*
through
me
to
find
my
worst
fears
thus
endorsed
.
Van
Helsing
*NL*
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
the
sad
experience
of
Miss
Lucy
,
we
must
this
time
be
warned
*NL*
before
things
go
too
far
.
Our
task
is
now
in
reality
more
difficult
than
*NL*
ever
,
and
this
new
trouble
makes
every
hour
of
the
direst
importance
.
I
*NL*
can
see
the
characteristics
of
the
vampire
coming
in
her
face
.
It
is
now
*NL*
but
very
,
very
slight
;
but
it
is
to
be
seen
if
we
have
eyes
to
notice
*NL*
without
to
prejudge
.
Her
teeth
are
some
sharper
,
and
at
times
her
eyes
*NL*
are
more
hard
.
But
these
are
not
all
,
there
is
to
her
the
silence
now
*NL*
often
;
as
so
it
was
with
Miss
Lucy
.
She
did
not
speak
,
even
when
she
*NL*
wrote
that
which
she
wished
to
be
known
later
.
Now
my
fear
is
this
.
If
*NL*
it
be
that
she
can
,
by
our
hypnotic
trance
,
tell
what
the
Count
see
and
*NL*
hear
,
is
it
not
more
true
that
he
who
have
hypnotise
her
first
,
and
who
*NL*
have
drink
of
her
very
blood
and
make
her
drink
of
his
,
should
,
if
he
*NL*
will
,
compel
her
mind
to
disclose
to
him
that
which
she
know
?
''
I
nodded
*NL*
acquiescence
;
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
what
we
must
do
is
to
prevent
this
;
we
must
keep
her
ignorant
of
*NL*
our
intent
,
and
so
she
can
not
tell
what
she
know
not
.
This
is
a
painful
*NL*
task
!
Oh
,
so
painful
that
it
heart-break
me
to
think
of
;
but
it
must
be
.
*NL*
When
to-day
we
meet
,
I
must
tell
her
that
for
reason
which
we
will
not
*NL*
to
speak
she
must
not
more
be
of
our
council
,
but
be
simply
guarded
by
*NL*
us
.
''
He
wiped
his
forehead
,
which
had
broken
out
in
profuse
perspiration
*NL*
at
the
thought
of
the
pain
which
he
might
have
to
inflict
upon
the
poor
*NL*
soul
already
so
tortured
.
I
knew
that
it
would
be
some
sort
of
comfort
*NL*
to
him
if
I
told
him
that
I
also
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
;
for
at
*NL*
any
rate
it
would
take
away
the
pain
of
doubt
.
I
told
him
,
and
the
*NL*
effect
was
as
I
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
now
close
to
the
time
of
our
general
gathering
.
Van
Helsing
has
*NL*
gone
away
to
prepare
for
the
meeting
,
and
his
painful
part
of
it
.
I
*NL*
really
believe
his
purpose
is
to
be
able
to
pray
alone
.

_
Later
.
_
--
At
the
very
outset
of
our
meeting
a
great
personal
relief
was
*NL*
experienced
by
both
Van
Helsing
and
myself
.
Mrs.
Harker
had
sent
a
*NL*
message
by
her
husband
to
say
that
she
would
not
join
us
at
present
,
as
*NL*
she
thought
it
better
that
we
should
be
free
to
discuss
our
movements
*NL*
without
her
presence
to
embarrass
us
.
The
Professor
and
I
looked
at
each
*NL*
other
for
an
instant
,
and
somehow
we
both
seemed
relieved
.
For
my
own
*NL*
part
,
I
thought
that
if
Mrs.
Harker
realised
the
danger
herself
,
it
was
*NL*
much
pain
as
well
as
much
danger
averted
.
Under
the
circumstances
we
*NL*
agreed
,
by
a
questioning
look
and
answer
,
with
finger
on
lip
,
to
*NL*
preserve
silence
in
our
suspicions
,
until
we
should
have
been
able
to
*NL*
confer
alone
again
.
We
went
at
once
into
our
Plan
of
Campaign
.
Van
*NL*
Helsing
roughly
put
the
facts
before
us
first
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
left
the
Thames
yesterday
morning
.
It
will
take
*NL*
her
at
the
quickest
speed
she
has
ever
made
at
least
three
weeks
to
*NL*
reach
Varna
;
but
we
can
travel
overland
to
the
same
place
in
three
days
.
*NL*
Now
,
if
we
allow
for
two
days
less
for
the
ship
's
voyage
,
owing
to
such
*NL*
weather
influences
as
we
know
that
the
Count
can
bring
to
bear
;
and
if
*NL*
we
allow
a
whole
day
and
night
for
any
delays
which
may
occur
to
us
,
*NL*
then
we
have
a
margin
of
nearly
two
weeks
.
Thus
,
in
order
to
be
quite
*NL*
safe
,
we
must
leave
here
on
17th
at
latest
.
Then
we
shall
at
any
rate
*NL*
be
in
Varna
a
day
before
the
ship
arrives
,
and
able
to
make
such
*NL*
preparations
as
may
be
necessary
.
Of
course
we
shall
all
go
armed
--
armed
*NL*
against
evil
things
,
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
.

Here
Quincey
Morris
*NL*
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
that
the
Count
comes
from
a
wolf
country
,
and
it
may
be
*NL*
that
he
shall
get
there
before
us
.
I
propose
that
we
add
Winchesters
to
*NL*
our
armament
.
I
have
a
kind
of
belief
in
a
Winchester
when
there
is
any
*NL*
trouble
of
that
sort
around
.
Do
you
remember
,
Art
,
when
we
had
the
pack
*NL*
after
us
at
Tobolsk
?
What
would
n't
we
have
given
then
for
a
repeater
*NL*
apiece
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
Van
Helsing
,
``
Winchesters
it
shall
be
.
Quincey
's
head
is
*NL*
level
at
all
times
,
but
most
so
when
there
is
to
hunt
,
metaphor
be
more
*NL*
dishonour
to
science
than
wolves
be
of
danger
to
man
.
In
the
meantime
we
*NL*
can
do
nothing
here
;
and
as
I
think
that
Varna
is
not
familiar
to
any
of
*NL*
us
,
why
not
go
there
more
soon
?
It
is
as
long
to
wait
here
as
there
.
*NL*
To-night
and
to-morrow
we
can
get
ready
,
and
then
,
if
all
be
well
,
we
*NL*
four
can
set
out
on
our
journey
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
four
?

said
Harker
interrogatively
,
looking
from
one
to
another
of
*NL*
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
!
''
answered
the
Professor
quickly
,
``
you
must
remain
to
take
*NL*
care
of
your
so
sweet
wife
!
''
Harker
was
silent
for
awhile
and
then
said
*NL*
in
a
hollow
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
talk
of
that
part
of
it
in
the
morning

I
want
to
consult
with

Mina

I
thought
that
now
was
the
time
for
Van
Helsing
to
warn
him
not
*NL*
to
disclose
our
plans
to
her
;
but
he
took
no
notice
.
I
looked
at
him
*NL*
significantly
and
coughed
.
For
answer
he
put
his
finger
on
his
lips

turned
away

5
October
,
afternoon
.
_
--
For
some
time
after
our
meeting
this
morning
I
*NL*
could
not
think
.
The
new
phases
of
things
leave
my
mind
in
a
state
of
*NL*
wonder
which
allows
no
room
for
active
thought
.
Mina
's
determination
not
*NL*
to
take
any
part
in
the
discussion
set
me
thinking
;
and
as
I
could
not
*NL*
argue
the
matter
with
her
,
I
could
only
guess
.
I
am
as
far
as
ever
from
*NL*
a
solution
now
.
The
way
the
others
received
it
,
too
,
puzzled
me
;
the
*NL*
last
time
we
talked
of
the
subject
we
agreed
that
there
was
to
be
no
*NL*
more
concealment
of
anything
amongst
us
.
Mina
is
sleeping
now
,
calmly
*NL*
and
sweetly
like
a
little
child
.
Her
lips
are
curved
and
her
face
beams
*NL*
with
happiness
.
Thank
God
,
there
are
such
moments
still
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Later
.
_
--
How
strange
it
all
is
.
I
sat
watching
Mina
's
happy
sleep
,
and
*NL*
came
as
near
to
being
happy
myself
as
I
suppose
I
shall
ever
be
.
As
the
*NL*
evening
drew
on
,
and
the
earth
took
its
shadows
from
the
sun
sinking
*NL*
lower
,
the
silence
of
the
room
grew
more
and
more
solemn
to
me
.
All
at
*NL*
once
Mina
opened
her
eyes
,
and
looking
at
me
tenderly
,
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jonathan
,
I
want
you
to
promise
me
something
on
your
word
of
honour
.
A
*NL*
promise
made
to
me
,
but
made
holily
in
God
's
hearing
,
and
not
to
be
*NL*
broken
though
I
should
go
down
on
my
knees
and
implore
you
with
bitter
*NL*
tears
.
Quick
,
you
must
make
it
to
me
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mina
,
''
I
said
,
``
a
promise
like
that
,
I
can
not
make
at
once
.
I
may
have
*NL*
no
right
to
make
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
dear
one
,
''
she
said
,
with
such
spiritual
intensity
that
her
eyes
*NL*
were
like
pole
stars
,
``
it
is
I
who
wish
it
;
and
it
is
not
for
myself
.
*NL*
You
can
ask
Dr.
Van
Helsing
if
I
am
not
right
;
if
he
disagrees
you
may
*NL*
do
as
you
will
.
Nay
,
more
,
if
you
all
agree
,
later
,
you
are
absolved
*NL*
from
the
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
!
''
I
said
,
and
for
a
moment
she
looked
supremely
happy
;
though
*NL*
to
me
all
happiness
for
her
was
denied
by
the
red
scar
on
her
forehead
.
*NL*
She
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
me
that
you
will
not
tell
me
anything
of
the
plans
formed
for
*NL*
the
campaign
against
the
Count
.
Not
by
word
,
or
inference
,
or
*NL*
implication
;
not
at
any
time
whilst
this
remains
to
me
!
''
and
she
*NL*
solemnly
pointed
to
the
scar
.
I
saw
that
she
was
in
earnest
,
and
said
*NL*
solemnly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
!
''
and
as
I
said
it
I
felt
that
from
that
instant
a
door
had
*NL*
been
shut
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
_
Later
,
midnight
.
_
--
Mina
has
been
bright
and
cheerful
all
the
evening
.
*NL*
So
much
so
that
all
the
rest
seemed
to
take
courage
,
as
if
infected
*NL*
somewhat
with
her
gaiety
;
as
a
result
even
I
myself
felt
as
if
the
pall
*NL*
of
gloom
which
weighs
us
down
were
somewhat
lifted
.
We
all
retired
*NL*
early
.
Mina
is
now
sleeping
like
a
little
child
;
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
*NL*
that
her
faculty
of
sleep
remains
to
her
in
the
midst
of
her
terrible
*NL*
trouble
.
Thank
God
for
it
,
for
then
at
least
she
can
forget
her
care
.
*NL*
Perhaps
her
example
may
affect
me
as
her
gaiety
did
to-night
.
I
shall
*NL*
try
it
.
Oh
!
for
a
dreamless
sleep
.

6
October
,
morning
.
_
--
Another
surprise
.
Mina
woke
me
early
,
about
the
*NL*
same
time
as
yesterday
,
and
asked
me
to
bring
Dr.
Van
Helsing
.
I
thought
*NL*
that
it
was
another
occasion
for
hypnotism
,
and
without
question
went
*NL*
for
the
Professor
.
He
had
evidently
expected
some
such
call
,
for
I
found
*NL*
him
dressed
in
his
room
.
His
door
was
ajar
,
so
that
he
could
hear
the
*NL*
opening
of
the
door
of
our
room
.
He
came
at
once
;
as
he
passed
into
the
*NL*
room
,
he
asked
Mina
if
the
others
might
come
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
quite
simply
,
``
it
will
not
be
necessary
.
You
can
tell
*NL*
them
just
as
well
.
I
must
go
with
you
on
your
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Van
Helsing
was
as
startled
as
I
was
.
After
a
moment
's
pause
he
*NL*
asked
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
take
me
with
you
.
I
am
safer
with
you
,
and
you
shall
be
safer
,
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
dear
Madam
Mina
?
You
know
that
your
safety
is
our
solemnest
*NL*
duty
.
We
go
into
danger
,
to
which
you
are
,
or
may
be
,
more
liable
than
*NL*
any
of
us
from
--
from
circumstances
--
things
that
have
been
.
''
He
paused
,
*NL*
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
replied
,
she
raised
her
finger
and
pointed
to
her
forehead
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
That
is
why
I
must
go
.
I
can
tell
you
now
,
whilst
the
sun
is
*NL*
coming
up
;
I
may
not
be
able
again
.
I
know
that
when
the
Count
wills
me
*NL*
I
must
go
.
I
know
that
if
he
tells
me
to
come
in
secret
,
I
must
come
by
*NL*
wile
;
by
any
device
to
hoodwink
--
even
Jonathan
.
''
God
saw
the
look
that
*NL*
she
turned
on
me
as
she
spoke
,
and
if
there
be
indeed
a
Recording
Angel
*NL*
that
look
is
noted
to
her
everlasting
honour
.
I
could
only
clasp
her
*NL*
hand
.
I
could
not
speak
;
my
emotion
was
too
great
for
even
the
relief
of
*NL*
tears
.
She
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
men
are
brave
and
strong
.
You
are
strong
in
your
numbers
,
for
you
*NL*
can
defy
that
which
would
break
down
the
human
endurance
of
one
who
had
*NL*
to
guard
alone
.
Besides
,
I
may
be
of
service
,
since
you
can
hypnotise
me
*NL*
and
so
learn
that
which
even
I
myself
do
not
know
.
''
Dr.
Van
Helsing
said
*NL*
very
gravely
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
Mina
,
you
are
,
as
always
,
most
wise
.
You
shall
with
us
come
;
and
*NL*
together
we
shall
do
that
which
we
go
forth
to
achieve
.
''
When
he
had
*NL*
spoken
,
Mina
's
long
spell
of
silence
made
me
look
at
her
.
She
had
fallen
*NL*
back
on
her
pillow
asleep
;
she
did
not
even
wake
when
I
had
pulled
up
*NL*
the
blind
and
let
in
the
sunlight
which
flooded
the
room
.
Van
Helsing
*NL*
motioned
to
me
to
come
with
him
quietly
.
We
went
to
his
room
,
and
within
*NL*
a
minute
Lord
Godalming
,
Dr.
Seward
,
and
Mr.
Morris
were
with
us
also
.
*NL*
He
told
them
what
Mina
had
said
,
and
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
morning
we
shall
leave
for
Varna
.
We
have
now
to
deal
with
a
*NL*
new
factor
:
Madam
Mina
.
Oh
,
but
her
soul
is
true
.
It
is
to
her
an
agony
*NL*
to
tell
us
so
much
as
she
has
done
;
but
it
is
most
right
,
and
we
are
*NL*
warned
in
time
.
There
must
be
no
chance
lost
,
and
in
Varna
we
must
be
*NL*
ready
to
act
the
instant
when
that
ship
arrives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do
exactly
?
''
asked
Mr.
Morris
laconically
.
The
Professor
*NL*
paused
before
replying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
at
the
first
board
that
ship
;
then
,
when
we
have
identified
*NL*
the
box
,
we
shall
place
a
branch
of
the
wild
rose
on
it
.
This
we
shall
*NL*
fasten
,
for
when
it
is
there
none
can
emerge
;
so
at
least
says
the
*NL*
superstition
.
And
to
superstition
must
we
trust
at
the
first
;
it
was
*NL*
man
's
faith
in
the
early
,
and
it
have
its
root
in
faith
still
.
Then
,
*NL*
when
we
get
the
opportunity
that
we
seek
,
when
none
are
near
to
see
,
we
*NL*
shall
open
the
box
,
and
--
and
all
will
be
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
wait
for
any
opportunity
,
''
said
Morris
.
``
When
I
see
the
box
*NL*
I
shall
open
it
and
destroy
the
monster
,
though
there
were
a
thousand
*NL*
men
looking
on
,
and
if
I
am
to
be
wiped
out
for
it
the
next
moment
!
''
I
*NL*
grasped
his
hand
instinctively
and
found
it
as
firm
as
a
piece
of
steel
.
*NL*
I
think
he
understood
my
look
;
I
hope
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
boy

said
Dr.
Van
Helsing
.
``
Brave
boy

Quincey
is
all

God
*NL*
bless
him
for
it

My
child
,
believe
me
none
of
us
shall
lag
behind
or
*NL*
pause
from
any
fear

I
do
but
say
what
we
may
do
--
what
we
must
do
.
But
,
*NL*
indeed
,
indeed
we
can
not
say
what
we
shall
do

There
are
so
many
things
*NL*
which
may
happen
,
and
their
ways
and
their
ends
are
so
various
that
*NL*
until
the
moment
we
may
not
say

We
shall
all
be
armed

in
all
ways

and
*NL*
when
the
time
for
the
end
has
come
,
our
effort
shall
not
be

Now
*NL*
let
us
to-day
put
all
our
affairs
in
order

Let
all
things
which
touch
*NL*

be
complete

for
none

As
for
me

my
own
*NL*
affairs
are
regulate
;
and
as
I
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
I
shall
go
make
*NL*
arrangements
for
the
travel
.
I
shall
have
all
tickets
and
so
forth
for
*NL*
our
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
further
to
be
said
,
and
we
parted
.
I
shall
now
settle
*NL*
up
all
my
affairs
of
earth
,
and
be
ready
for
whatever
may
come
...

_
Later

--
It
is
all
done
;
my
will
is
made
,
and
all
complete
.
Mina
if
she
*NL*
survive
is
my
sole
heir
.
If
it
should
not
be
so
,
then
the
others
who
*NL*
have
been
so
good
to
us
shall
have
remainder
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
now
drawing
towards
the
sunset
;
Mina
's
uneasiness
calls
my
*NL*
attention
to
it
.
I
am
sure
that
there
is
something
on
her
mind
which
the
*NL*
time
of
exact
sunset
will
reveal
.
These
occasions
are
becoming
harrowing
*NL*
times
for
us
all
,
for
each
sunrise
and
sunset
opens
up
some
new
*NL*
danger
--
some
new
pain
,
which
,
however
,
may
in
God
's
will
be
means
to
a
*NL*
good
end
.
I
write
all
these
things
in
the
diary
since
my
darling
must
*NL*
not
hear
them
now
;
but
if
it
may
be
that
she
can
see
them
again

October

Evening

_
--
Jonathan
Harker
has
asked
me
to
note
this
,
as
he
*NL*
says
he
is
hardly
equal
to
the
task
,
and
he
wants
an
exact
record
kept
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
that
none
of
us
were
surprised
when
we
were
asked
to
see
Mrs.
*NL*
Harker
a
little
before
the
time
of
sunset
.
We
have
of
late
come
to
*NL*
understand
that
sunrise
and
sunset
are
to
her
times
of
peculiar
freedom
;
*NL*
when
her
old
self
can
be
manifest
without
any
controlling
force
subduing
*NL*
or
restraining
her
,
or
inciting
her
to
action
.
This
mood
or
condition
*NL*
begins
some
half
hour
or
more
before
actual
sunrise
or
sunset
,
and
lasts
*NL*
till
either
the
sun
is
high
,
or
whilst
the
clouds
are
still
aglow
with
*NL*
the
rays
streaming
above
the
horizon
.
At
first
there
is
a
sort
of
*NL*
negative
condition
,
as
if
some
tie
were
loosened
,
and
then
the
absolute
*NL*
freedom
quickly
follows
;
when
,
however
,
the
freedom
ceases
the
*NL*
change-back
or
relapse
comes
quickly
,
preceded
only
by
a
spell
of
*NL*
warning
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-night
,
when
we
met
,
she
was
somewhat
constrained
,
and
bore
all
the
*NL*
signs
of
an
internal
struggle
.
I
put
it
down
myself
to
her
making
a
*NL*
violent
effort
at
the
earliest
instant
she
could
do
so
.
A
very
few
*NL*
minutes
,
however
,
gave
her
complete
control
of
herself
;
then
,
motioning
*NL*
her
husband
to
sit
beside
her
on
the
sofa
where
she
was
half
reclining
,
*NL*
she
made
the
rest
of
us
bring
chairs
up
close
.
Taking
her
husband
's
hand
*NL*
in
hers
began
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
all
here
together
in
freedom
,
for
perhaps
the
last
time
!
I
know
,
*NL*
dear
;
I
know
that
you
will
always
be
with
me
to
the
end
.
''
This
was
to
*NL*
her
husband
whose
hand
had
,
as
we
could
see
,
tightened
upon
hers
.
``
In
*NL*
the
morning
we
go
out
upon
our
task
,
and
God
alone
knows
what
may
be
in
*NL*
store
for
any
of
us
.
You
are
going
to
be
so
good
to
me
as
to
take
me
*NL*
with
you
.
I
know
that
all
that
brave
earnest
men
can
do
for
a
poor
weak
*NL*
woman
,
whose
soul
perhaps
is
lost
--
no
,
no
,
not
yet
,
but
is
at
any
rate
*NL*
at
stake
--
you
will
do
.
But
you
must
remember
that
I
am
not
as
you
are
.
*NL*
There
is
a
poison
in
my
blood
,
in
my
soul
,
which
may
destroy
me
;
which
*NL*
must
destroy
me
,
unless
some
relief
comes
to
us
.
Oh
,
my
friends
,
you
*NL*
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
my
soul
is
at
stake
;
and
though
I
know
there
*NL*
is
one
way
out
for
me
,
you
must
not
and
I
must
not
take
it
!
''
She
looked
*NL*
appealingly
to
us
all
in
turn
,
beginning
and
ending
with
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
way
?
''
asked
Van
Helsing
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
``
What
is
that
*NL*
way
,
which
we
must
not
--
may
not
--
take
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
may
die
now
,
either
by
my
own
hand
or
that
of
another
,
before
*NL*
the
greater
evil
is
entirely
wrought
.
I
know
,
and
you
know
,
that
were
I
*NL*
once
dead
you
could
and
would
set
free
my
immortal
spirit
,
even
as
you
*NL*
did
my
poor
Lucy
's
.
Were
death
,
or
the
fear
of
death
,
the
only
thing
*NL*
that
stood
in
the
way
I
would
not
shrink
to
die
here
,
now
,
amidst
the
*NL*
friends
who
love
me
.
But
death
is
not
all
.
I
can
not
believe
that
to
die
*NL*
in
such
a
case
,
when
there
is
hope
before
us
and
a
bitter
task
to
be
*NL*
done
,
is
God
's
will
.
Therefore
,
I
,
on
my
part
,
give
up
here
the
*NL*
certainty
of
eternal
rest
,
and
go
out
into
the
dark
where
may
be
the
*NL*
blackest
things
that
the
world
or
the
nether
world
holds
!
''
We
were
all
*NL*
silent
,
for
we
knew
instinctively
that
this
was
only
a
prelude
.
The
*NL*
faces
of
the
others
were
set
and
Harker
's
grew
ashen
grey
;
perhaps
he
*NL*
guessed
better
than
any
of
us
what
was
coming
.
She
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
can
give
into
the
hotch-pot
.
''
I
could
not
but
note
the
*NL*
quaint
legal
phrase
which
she
used
in
such
a
place
,
and
with
all
*NL*
seriousness
.
``
What
will
each
of
you
give
?
Your
lives
I
know
,
''
she
went
*NL*
on
quickly
,
``
that
is
easy
for
brave
men
.
Your
lives
are
God
's
,
and
you
*NL*
can
give
them
back
to
Him
;
but
what
will
you
give
to
me
?
''
She
looked
*NL*
again
questioningly
,
but
this
time
avoided
her
husband
's
face
.
Quincey
*NL*
seemed
to
understand
;
he
nodded
,
and
her
face
lit
up
.
``
Then
I
shall
tell
*NL*
you
plainly
what
I
want
,
for
there
must
be
no
doubtful
matter
in
this
*NL*
connection
between
us
now
.
You
must
promise
me
,
one
and
all
--
even
you
,
*NL*
my
beloved
husband
--
that
,
should
the
time
come
,
you
will
kill
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
time
?
''
The
voice
was
Quincey
's
,
but
it
was
low
and
*NL*
strained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
shall
be
convinced
that
I
am
so
changed
that
it
is
better
that
*NL*
I
die
that
I
may
live
.
When
I
am
thus
dead
in
the
flesh
,
then
you
will
,
*NL*
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
drive
a
stake
through
me
and
cut
off
my
head
;
*NL*
or
do
whatever
else
may
be
wanting
to
give
me
rest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quincey
was
the
first
to
rise
after
the
pause
.
He
knelt
down
before
her
*NL*
and
taking
her
hand
in
his
said
solemnly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
only
a
rough
fellow
,
who
has
n't
,
perhaps
,
lived
as
a
man
should
to
*NL*
win
such
a
distinction
,
but
I
swear
to
you
by
all
that
I
hold
sacred
and
*NL*
dear
that
,
should
the
time
ever
come
,
I
shall
not
flinch
from
the
duty
*NL*
that
you
have
set
us
.
And
I
promise
you
,
too
,
that
I
shall
make
all
*NL*
certain
,
for
if
I
am
only
doubtful
I
shall
take
it
that
the
time
has
*NL*
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
true
friend
!
''
was
all
she
could
say
amid
her
fast-falling
tears
,
as
,
*NL*
bending
over
,
she
kissed
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
the
same
,
my
dear
Madam
Mina
!
''
said
Van
Helsing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
!
''
said
Lord
Godalming
,
each
of
them
in
turn
kneeling
to
her
to
*NL*
take
the
oath
.
I
followed
,
myself
.
Then
her
husband
turned
to
her
*NL*
wan-eyed
and
with
a
greenish
pallor
which
subdued
the
snowy
whiteness
of
*NL*
his
hair
,
and
asked
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
must
I
,
too
,
make
such
a
promise
,
oh
,
my
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
too
,
my
dearest
,
''
she
said
,
with
infinite
yearning
of
pity
in
her
*NL*
voice
and
eyes
.
``
You
must
not
shrink
.
You
are
nearest
and
dearest
and
*NL*
all
the
world
to
me
;
our
souls
are
knit
into
one
,
for
all
life
and
all
*NL*
time
.
Think
,
dear
,
that
there
have
been
times
when
brave
men
have
killed
*NL*
their
wives
and
their
womenkind
,
to
keep
them
from
falling
into
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
enemy
.
Their
hands
did
not
falter
any
the
more
because
*NL*
those
that
they
loved
implored
them
to
slay
them
.
It
is
men
's
duty
*NL*
towards
those
whom
they
love
,
in
such
times
of
sore
trial
!
And
oh
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
if
it
is
to
be
that
I
must
meet
death
at
any
hand
,
let
it
be
at
*NL*
the
hand
of
him
that
loves
me
best
.
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
I
have
not
*NL*
forgotten
your
mercy
in
poor
Lucy
's
case
to
him
who
loved
''
--
she
stopped
*NL*
with
a
flying
blush
,
and
changed
her
phrase
--
``
to
him
who
had
best
right
*NL*
to
give
her
peace
.
If
that
time
shall
come
again
,
I
look
to
you
to
make
*NL*
it
a
happy
memory
of
my
husband
's
life
that
it
was
his
loving
hand
which
*NL*
set
me
free
from
the
awful
thrall
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
I
swear
!
''
came
the
Professor
's
resonant
voice
.
Mrs.
Harker
*NL*
smiled
,
positively
smiled
,
as
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
leaned
back
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
one
word
of
warning
,
a
warning
which
you
must
never
forget
:
*NL*
this
time
,
if
it
ever
come
,
may
come
quickly
and
unexpectedly
,
and
in
*NL*
such
case
you
must
lose
no
time
in
using
your
opportunity
.
At
such
a
*NL*
time
I
myself
might
be
--
nay
!
if
the
time
ever
comes
,
_
shall
be
_
--
leagued
*NL*
with
your
enemy
against
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
more
request
;
''
she
became
very
solemn
as
she
said
this
,
``
it
is
not
*NL*
vital
and
necessary
like
the
other
,
but
I
want
you
to
do
one
thing
for
*NL*
me
,
if
you
will
.
''
We
all
acquiesced
,
but
no
one
spoke
;
there
was
no
need
*NL*
to
speak
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
read
the
Burial
Service
.
''
She
was
interrupted
by
a
deep
*NL*
groan
from
her
husband
;
taking
his
hand
in
hers
,
she
held
it
over
her
*NL*
heart
,
and
continued
:
``
You
must
read
it
over
me
some
day
.
Whatever
may
*NL*
be
the
issue
of
all
this
fearful
state
of
things
,
it
will
be
a
sweet
*NL*
thought
to
all
or
some
of
us
.
You
,
my
dearest
,
will
I
hope
read
it
,
for
*NL*
then
it
will
be
in
your
voice
in
my
memory
for
ever
--
come
what
may
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
oh
,
my
dear
one
,
''
he
pleaded
,
``
death
is
afar
off
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
she
said
,
holding
up
a
warning
hand
.
``
I
am
deeper
in
death
at
*NL*
this
moment
than
if
the
weight
of
an
earthly
grave
lay
heavy
upon
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
wife
,
must
I
read
it
?
''
he
said
,
before
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
comfort
me
,
my
husband
!
''
was
all
she
said
;
and
he
began
to
*NL*
read
when
she
had
got
the
book
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
--
how
could
any
one
--
tell
of
that
strange
scene
,
its
*NL*
solemnity
,
its
gloom
,
its
sadness
,
its
horror
;
and
,
withal
,
its
*NL*
sweetness
.
Even
a
sceptic
,
who
can
see
nothing
but
a
travesty
of
bitter
*NL*
truth
in
anything
holy
or
emotional
,
would
have
been
melted
to
the
heart
*NL*
had
he
seen
that
little
group
of
loving
and
devoted
friends
kneeling
*NL*
round
that
stricken
and
sorrowing
lady
;
or
heard
the
tender
passion
of
*NL*
her
husband
's
voice
,
as
in
tones
so
broken
with
emotion
that
often
he
*NL*
had
to
pause
,
he
read
the
simple
and
beautiful
service
from
the
Burial
*NL*
of
the
Dead
.
I
--
I
can
not
go
on

words

and

v-voice

f-fail
m-me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
right
in
her
instinct
.
Strange
as
it
all
was
,
bizarre
as
it
may
*NL*
hereafter
seem
even
to
us
who
felt
its
potent
influence
at
the
time
,
it
*NL*
comforted
us
much
;
and
the
silence
,
which
showed
Mrs.
Harker
's
coming
*NL*
relapse
from
her
freedom
of
soul
,
did
not
seem
so
full
of
despair
to
any
*NL*
of
us
as
we
had
dreaded
.

15
October

Varna

--
We
left
Charing
Cross
on
the
morning
of
the
12th
,
*NL*
got
to
Paris
the
same
night
,
and
took
the
places
secured
for
us
in
the
*NL*
Orient
Express
.
We
travelled
night
and
day
,
arriving
here
at
about
five
*NL*
o'clock
.
Lord
Godalming
went
to
the
Consulate
to
see
if
any
telegram
had
*NL*
arrived
for
him
,
whilst
the
rest
of
us
came
on
to
this
hotel
--
``
the
*NL*
Odessus
.
''
The
journey
may
have
had
incidents
;
I
was
,
however
,
too
eager
*NL*
to
get
on
,
to
care
for
them
.
Until
the
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
comes
into
*NL*
port
there
will
be
no
interest
for
me
in
anything
in
the
wide
world
.
*NL*
Thank
God
!
Mina
is
well
,
and
looks
to
be
getting
stronger
;
her
colour
is
*NL*
coming
back
.
She
sleeps
a
great
deal
;
throughout
the
journey
she
slept
*NL*
nearly
all
the
time
.
Before
sunrise
and
sunset
,
however
,
she
is
very
*NL*
wakeful
and
alert
;
and
it
has
become
a
habit
for
Van
Helsing
to
*NL*
hypnotise
her
at
such
times
.
At
first
,
some
effort
was
needed
,
and
he
*NL*
had
to
make
many
passes
;
but
now
,
she
seems
to
yield
at
once
,
as
if
by
*NL*
habit
,
and
scarcely
any
action
is
needed
.
He
seems
to
have
power
at
*NL*
these
particular
moments
to
simply
will
,
and
her
thoughts
obey
him
.
He
*NL*
always
asks
her
what
she
can
see
and
hear
.
She
answers
to
the
first
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
;
all
is
dark
.

and

*NL*
It
is
evident
that
the
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
is
still
at
sea
,
hastening
on
*NL*
her
way
to
Varna
.
Lord
Godalming
has
just
returned
.
He
had
four
*NL*
telegrams
,
one
each
day
since
we
started
,
and
all
to
the
same
effect
:
*NL*
that
the
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
had
not
been
reported
to
Lloyd
's
from
*NL*
anywhere
.
He
had
arranged
before
leaving
London
that
his
agent
should
*NL*
send
him
every
day
a
telegram
saying
if
the
ship
had
been
reported
.
He
*NL*
was
to
have
a
message
even
if
she
were
not
reported
,
so
that
he
might
be
*NL*
sure
that
there
was
a
watch
being
kept
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
dinner
and
went
to
bed
early
.
To-morrow
we
are
to
see
the
*NL*
Vice-Consul
,
and
to
arrange
,
if
we
can
,
about
getting
on
board
the
ship
*NL*
as
soon
as
she
arrives
.
Van
Helsing
says
that
our
chance
will
be
to
get
*NL*
on
the
boat
between
sunrise
and
sunset
.
The
Count
,
even
if
he
takes
the
*NL*
form
of
a
bat
,
can
not
cross
the
running
water
of
his
own
volition
,
and
*NL*
so
can
not
leave
the
ship
.
As
he
dare
not
change
to
man
's
form
without
*NL*
suspicion
--
which
he
evidently
wishes
to
avoid
--
he
must
remain
in
the
*NL*
box
.
If
,
then
,
we
can
come
on
board
after
sunrise
,
he
is
at
our
mercy
;
*NL*
for
we
can
open
the
box
and
make
sure
of
him
,
as
we
did
of
poor
Lucy
,
*NL*
before
he
wakes
.
What
mercy
he
shall
get
from
us
will
not
count
for
*NL*
much
.
We
think
that
we
shall
not
have
much
trouble
with
officials
or
the
*NL*
seamen
.
Thank
God
!
this
is
the
country
where
bribery
can
do
anything
,
*NL*
and
we
are
well
supplied
with
money
.
We
have
only
to
make
sure
that
the
*NL*
ship
can
not
come
into
port
between
sunset
and
sunrise
without
our
being
*NL*
warned
,
and
we
shall
be
safe
.
Judge
Moneybag
will
settle
this
case
,
I
*NL*
think
!

in

Everything
is
pretty
well
fixed
now
,
I
think
,
to
welcome
*NL*
the
Count
on
his
return
from
his
tour
.
Godalming
told
the
shippers
that
*NL*
he
fancied
that
the
box
sent
aboard
might
contain
something
stolen
from
*NL*
a
friend
of
his
,
and
got
a
half
consent
that
he
might
open
it
at
his
own
*NL*
risk
.
The
owner
gave
him
a
paper
telling
the
Captain
to
give
him
every
*NL*
facility
in
doing
whatever
he
chose
on
board
the
ship
,
and
also
a
*NL*
similar
authorisation
to
his
agent
at
Varna
.
We
have
seen
the
agent
,
who
*NL*
was
much
impressed
with
Godalming
's
kindly
manner
to
him
,
and
we
are
all
*NL*
satisfied
that
whatever
he
can
do
to
aid
our
wishes
will
be
done
.
We
*NL*
have
already
arranged
what
to
do
in
case
we
get
the
box
open
.
If
the
*NL*
Count
is
there
,
Van
Helsing
and
Seward
will
cut
off
his
head
at
once
and
*NL*
drive
a
stake
through
his
heart
.
Morris
and
Godalming
and
I
shall
*NL*
prevent
interference
,
even
if
we
have
to
use
the
arms
which
we
shall
*NL*
have
ready
.
The
Professor
says
that
if
we
can
so
treat
the
Count
's
body
,
*NL*
it
will
soon
after
fall
into
dust
.
In
such
case
there
would
be
no
*NL*
evidence
against
us
,
in
case
any
suspicion
of
murder
were
aroused
.
But
*NL*
even
if
it
were
not
,
we
should
stand
or
fall
by
our
act
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
some
day
this
very
script
may
be
evidence
to
come
between
some
of
us
and
*NL*
a
rope
.
For
myself
,
I
should
take
the
chance
only
too
thankfully
if
it
*NL*
were
to
come
.
We
mean
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
carry
out
our
*NL*
intent
.
We
have
arranged
with
certain
officials
that
the
instant
the
*NL*
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
is
seen
,
we
are
to
be
informed
by
a
special

How
I
miss
my
phonograph
!
To
write
diary
with
a
pen
is
*NL*
irksome
to
me
;
but
Van
Helsing
says
I
must
.
We
were
all
wild
with
*NL*
excitement
yesterday
when
Godalming
got
his
telegram
from
Lloyd
's
.
I
*NL*
know
now
what
men
feel
in
battle
when
the
call
to
action
is
heard
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Harker
,
alone
of
our
party
,
did
not
show
any
signs
of
emotion
.
After
*NL*
all
,
it
is
not
strange
that
she
did
not
;
for
we
took
special
care
not
to
*NL*
let
her
know
anything
about
it
,
and
we
all
tried
not
to
show
any
*NL*
excitement
when
we
were
in
her
presence
.
In
old
days
she
would
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
,
have
noticed
,
no
matter
how
we
might
have
tried
to
conceal
it
;
but
*NL*
in
this
way
she
is
greatly
changed
during
the
past
three
weeks
.
The
*NL*
lethargy
grows
upon
her
,
and
though
she
seems
strong
and
well
,
and
is
*NL*
getting
back
some
of
her
colour
,
Van
Helsing
and
I
are
not
satisfied
.
We
*NL*
talk
of
her
often
;
we
have
not
,
however
,
said
a
word
to
the
others
.
It
*NL*
would
break
poor
Harker
's
heart
--
certainly
his
nerve
--
if
he
knew
that
we
*NL*
had
even
a
suspicion
on
the
subject
.
Van
Helsing
examines
,
he
tells
me
,
*NL*
her
teeth
very
carefully
,
whilst
she
is
in
the
hypnotic
condition
,
for
*NL*
he
says
that
so
long
as
they
do
not
begin
to
sharpen
there
is
no
active
*NL*
danger
of
a
change
in
her
.
If
this
change
should
come
,
it
would
be
*NL*
necessary
to
take
steps
!
...
We
both
know
what
those
steps
would
have
to
*NL*
be
,
though
we
do
not
mention
our
thoughts
to
each
other
.
We
should
*NL*
neither
of
us
shrink
from
the
task
--
awful
though
it
be
to
contemplate
.
*NL*
``
Euthanasia
''
is
an
excellent
and
a
comforting
word
!
I
am
grateful
to
*NL*
whoever
invented
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
only
about
24
hours
'
sail
from
the
Dardanelles
to
here
,
at
the
*NL*
rate
the
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
has
come
from
London
.
She
should
therefore
*NL*
arrive
some
time
in
the
morning
;
but
as
she
can
not
possibly
get
in
*NL*
before
then
,
we
are
all
about
to
retire
early
.
We
shall
get
up
at
one
*NL*
o'clock
,
so
as
to
be
ready
.

No
news
yet
of
the
ship
's
arrival
.
Mrs.
Harker
's
*NL*
hypnotic
report
this
morning
was
the
same
as
usual
,
so
it
is
possible
*NL*
that
we
may
get
news
at
any
moment
.
We
men
are
all
in
a
fever
of
*NL*
excitement
,
except
Harker
,
who
is
calm
;
his
hands
are
cold
as
ice
,
and
*NL*
an
hour
ago
I
found
him
whetting
the
edge
of
the
great
Ghoorka
knife
*NL*
which
he
now
always
carries
with
him
.
It
will
be
a
bad
lookout
for
the
*NL*
Count
if
the
edge
of
that
``
Kukri
''
ever
touches
his
throat
,
driven
by
*NL*
that
stern
,
ice-cold
hand
!
*NL*
*NL*
Van
Helsing
and
I
were
a
little
alarmed
about
Mrs.
Harker
to-day
.
About
*NL*
noon
she
got
into
a
sort
of
lethargy
which
we
did
not
like
;
although
we
*NL*
kept
silence
to
the
others
,
we
were
neither
of
us
happy
about
it
.
She
*NL*
had
been
restless
all
the
morning
,
so
that
we
were
at
first
glad
to
know
*NL*
that
she
was
sleeping
.
When
,
however
,
her
husband
mentioned
casually
*NL*
that
she
was
sleeping
so
soundly
that
he
could
not
wake
her
,
we
went
to
*NL*
her
room
to
see
for
ourselves
.
She
was
breathing
naturally
and
looked
so
*NL*
well
and
peaceful
that
we
agreed
that
the
sleep
was
better
for
her
than
*NL*
anything
else
.
Poor
girl
,
she
has
so
much
to
forget
that
it
is
no
wonder
*NL*
that
sleep
,
if
it
brings
oblivion
to
her
,
does
her
good
.

Our
opinion
was
justified
,
for
when
after
a
refreshing
sleep
*NL*
of
some
hours
she
woke
up
,
she
seemed
brighter
and
better
than
she
had
*NL*
been
for
days
.
At
sunset
she
made
the
usual
hypnotic
report
.
Wherever
he
*NL*
may
be
in
the
Black
Sea
,
the
Count
is
hurrying
to
his
destination
.
To
*NL*
his
doom

I
trust
!

That
she

is
*NL*
apparent
,
for
Mrs.
Harker
's
hypnotic
report
at
sunrise
was
still
the

It
is
possible
that
the
vessel
may
be
lying
by
,
at
times
,
for
fog
;
*NL*
some
of
the
steamers
which
came
in
last
evening
reported
patches
of
fog
*NL*
both
to
north
and
south
of
the
port
.
We
must
continue
our
watching
,
as
*NL*
the
ship
may
now
be
signalled
any
moment
.

Most

Mrs.
Harker
reported
last
night
and
this
morning
as
usual
:
``
lapping
*NL*
waves
and
rushing
water
,
''
though
she
added
that
``
the
waves
were
very
*NL*
faint

''
The
telegrams
from
London
have
been
the
same
:
``
no

Van
Helsing
is
terribly
anxious
,
and
told
me
just
now
that
he
*NL*
fears
the

added

up

When
the
telegram
came
announcing
the
arrival
in
Galatz
I
*NL*
do
not
think
it
was
such
a
shock
to
any
of
us
as
might
have
been
*NL*
expected
.
True
,
we
did
not
know
whence
,
or
how
,
or
when
,
the
bolt
would
*NL*
come
;
but
I
think
we
all
expected
that
something
strange
would
happen
.
*NL*
The
delay
of
arrival
at
Varna
made
us
individually
satisfied
that
things
*NL*
would
not
be
just
as
we
had
expected
;
we
only
waited
to
learn
where
the
*NL*
change
would
occur
.
None
the
less
,
however
,
was
it
a
surprise
.
I
suppose
*NL*
that
nature
works
on
such
a
hopeful
basis
that
we
believe
against
*NL*
ourselves
that
things
will
be
as
they
ought
to
be
,
not
as
we
should
know
*NL*
that
they
will
be
.
Transcendentalism
is
a
beacon
to
the
angels
,
even
if
*NL*
it
be
a
will-o
'
-
the-wisp
to
man
.
It
was
an
odd
experience
and
we
all
*NL*
took
it
differently
.
Van
Helsing
raised
his
hand
over
his
head
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
as
though
in
remonstrance
with
the
Almighty
;
but
he
said
not
a
*NL*
word
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
stood
up
with
his
face
sternly
set
.
Lord
*NL*
Godalming
grew
very
pale
,
and
sat
breathing
heavily
.
I
was
myself
half
*NL*
stunned
and
looked
in
wonder
at
one
after
another
.
Quincey
Morris
*NL*
tightened
his
belt
with
that
quick
movement
which
I
knew
so
well
;
in
our
*NL*
old
wandering
days
it
meant
``
action
.
''
Mrs.
Harker
grew
ghastly
white
,
so
*NL*
that
the
scar
on
her
forehead
seemed
to
burn
,
but
she
folded
her
hands
*NL*
meekly
and
looked
up
in
prayer
.
Harker
smiled
--
actually
smiled
--
the
*NL*
dark
,
bitter
smile
of
one
who
is
without
hope
;
but
at
the
same
time
his
*NL*
action
belied
his
words
,
for
his
hands
instinctively
sought
the
hilt
of
*NL*
the
great
Kukri
knife
and
rested
there
.
``
When
does
the
next
train
start
*NL*
for
Galatz
?
''
said
Van
Helsing
to
us
generally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
6:30
to-morrow
morning
!
''
We
all
started
,
for
the
answer
came
from
*NL*
Mrs.
Harker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
on
earth
do
you
know
?
''
said
Art
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget
--
or
perhaps
you
do
not
know
,
though
Jonathan
does
and
so
*NL*
does
Dr.
Van
Helsing
--
that
I
am
the
train
fiend
.
At
home
in
Exeter
I
*NL*
always
used
to
make
up
the
time-tables
,
so
as
to
be
helpful
to
my
*NL*
husband
.
I
found
it
so
useful
sometimes
,
that
I
always
make
a
study
of
*NL*
the
time-tables
now
.
I
knew
that
if
anything
were
to
take
us
to
Castle
*NL*
Dracula
we
should
go
by
Galatz
,
or
at
any
rate
through
Bucharest
,
so
I
*NL*
learned
the
times
very
carefully
.
Unhappily
there
are
not
many
to
learn
,
*NL*
as
the
only
train
to-morrow
leaves
as
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wonderful
woman
!
''
murmured
the
Professor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
we
get
a
special
?
''
asked
Lord
Godalming
.
Van
Helsing
shook
his
*NL*
head
:
``
I
fear
not
.
This
land
is
very
different
from
yours
or
mine
;
even
*NL*
if
we
did
have
a
special
,
it
would
probably
not
arrive
as
soon
as
our
*NL*
regular
train
.
Moreover
,
we
have
something
to
prepare
.
We
must
think
.
*NL*
Now
let
us
organize
.
You
,
friend
Arthur
,
go
to
the
train
and
get
the
*NL*
tickets
and
arrange
that
all
be
ready
for
us
to
go
in
the
morning
.
Do
*NL*
you
,
friend
Jonathan
,
go
to
the
agent
of
the
ship
and
get
from
him
*NL*
letters
to
the
agent
in
Galatz
,
with
authority
to
make
search
the
ship
*NL*
just
as
it
was
here
.
Morris
Quincey
,
you
see
the
Vice-Consul
,
and
get
*NL*
his
aid
with
his
fellow
in
Galatz
and
all
he
can
do
to
make
our
way
*NL*
smooth
,
so
that
no
times
be
lost
when
over
the
Danube
.
John
will
stay
*NL*
with
Madam
Mina
and
me
,
and
we
shall
consult
.
For
so
if
time
be
long
you
*NL*
may
be
delayed
;
and
it
will
not
matter
when
the
sun
set
,
since
I
am
here
*NL*
with
Madam
to
make
report
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
said
Mrs.
Harker
brightly
,
and
more
like
her
old
self
than
she
*NL*
had
been
for
many
a
long
day
,
``
shall
try
to
be
of
use
in
all
ways
,
and
*NL*
shall
think
and
write
for
you
as
I
used
to
do
.
Something
is
shifting
*NL*
from
me
in
some
strange
way
,
and
I
feel
freer
than
I
have
been
of
late
!
''
*NL*
The
three
younger
men
looked
happier
at
the
moment
as
they
seemed
to
*NL*
realise
the
significance
of
her
words
;
but
Van
Helsing
and
I
,
turning
to
*NL*
each
other
,
met
each
a
grave
and
troubled
glance
.
We
said
nothing
at
the
*NL*
time
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
three
men
had
gone
out
to
their
tasks
Van
Helsing
asked
Mrs.
*NL*
Harker
to
look
up
the
copy
of
the
diaries
and
find
him
the
part
of
*NL*
Harker
's
journal
at
the
Castle
.
She
went
away
to
get
it
;
when
the
door
*NL*
was
shut
upon
her
he
said
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
mean
the
same
!
speak
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
some
change
.
It
is
a
hope
that
makes
me
sick
,
for
it
may
*NL*
deceive
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
.
Do
you
know
why
I
asked
her
to
get
the
manuscript
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
said
I
,
``
unless
it
was
to
get
an
opportunity
of
seeing
me
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
part
right
,
friend
John
,
but
only
in
part
.
I
want
to
tell
*NL*
you
something
.
And
oh
,
my
friend
,
I
am
taking
a
great
--
a
terrible
--
risk
;
*NL*
but
I
believe
it
is
right
.
In
the
moment
when
Madam
Mina
said
those
*NL*
words
that
arrest
both
our
understanding
,
an
inspiration
came
to
me
.
In
*NL*
the
trance
of
three
days
ago
the
Count
sent
her
his
spirit
to
read
her
*NL*
mind
;
or
more
like
he
took
her
to
see
him
in
his
earth-box
in
the
ship
*NL*
with
water
rushing
,
just
as
it
go
free
at
rise
and
set
of
sun
.
He
learn
*NL*
then
that
we
are
here
;
for
she
have
more
to
tell
in
her
open
life
with
*NL*
eyes
to
see
and
ears
to
hear
than
he
,
shut
,
as
he
is
,
in
his
coffin-box
.
*NL*
Now
he
make
his
most
effort
to
escape
us
.
At
present
he
want
her
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
sure
with
his
so
great
knowledge
that
she
will
come
at
his
call
;
*NL*
but
he
cut
her
off
--
take
her
,
as
he
can
do
,
out
of
his
own
power
,
that
*NL*
so
she
come
not
to
him
.
Ah
!
there
I
have
hope
that
our
man-brains
that
*NL*
have
been
of
man
so
long
and
that
have
not
lost
the
grace
of
God
,
will
*NL*
come
higher
than
his
child-brain
that
lie
in
his
tomb
for
centuries
,
*NL*
that
grow
not
yet
to
our
stature
,
and
that
do
only
work
selfish
and
*NL*
therefore
small
.
Here
comes
Madam
Mina
;
not
a
word
to
her
of
her
trance
!
*NL*
She
know
it
not
;
and
it
would
overwhelm
her
and
make
despair
just
when
*NL*
we
want
all
her
hope
,
all
her
courage
;
when
most
we
want
all
her
great
*NL*
brain
which
is
trained
like
man
's
brain
,
but
is
of
sweet
woman
and
have
*NL*
a
special
power
which
the
Count
give
her
,
and
which
he
may
not
take
away
*NL*
altogether
--
though
he
think
not
so
.
Hush
!
let
me
speak
,
and
you
shall
*NL*
learn
.
Oh
,
John
,
my
friend
,
we
are
in
awful
straits
.
I
fear
,
as
I
never
*NL*
feared
before
.
We
can
only
trust
the
good
God
.
Silence
!
here
she
comes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
that
the
Professor
was
going
to
break
down
and
have
hysterics
,
*NL*
just
as
he
had
when
Lucy
died
,
but
with
a
great
effort
he
controlled
*NL*
himself
and
was
at
perfect
nervous
poise
when
Mrs.
Harker
tripped
into
*NL*
the
room
,
bright
and
happy-looking
and
,
in
the
doing
of
work
,
seemingly
*NL*
forgetful
of
her
misery
.
As
she
came
in
,
she
handed
a
number
of
sheets
*NL*
of
typewriting
to
Van
Helsing
.
He
looked
over
them
gravely
,
his
face
*NL*
brightening
up
as
he
read
.
Then
holding
the
pages
between
his
finger
and
*NL*
thumb
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
John
,
to
you
with
so
much
of
experience
already
--
and
you
,
too
,
*NL*
dear
Madam
Mina
,
that
are
young
--
here
is
a
lesson
:
do
not
fear
ever
to
*NL*
think
.
A
half-thought
has
been
buzzing
often
in
my
brain
,
but
I
fear
to
*NL*
let
him
loose
his
wings
.
Here
now
,
with
more
knowledge
,
I
go
back
to
*NL*
where
that
half-thought
come
from
and
I
find
that
he
be
no
half-thought
*NL*
at
all
;
that
be
a
whole
thought
,
though
so
young
that
he
is
not
yet
*NL*
strong
to
use
his
little
wings
.
Nay
,
like
the
``
Ugly
Duck
''
of
my
friend
*NL*
Hans
Andersen
,
he
be
no
duck-thought
at
all
,
but
a
big
swan-thought
that
*NL*
sail
nobly
on
big
wings
,
when
the
time
come
for
him
to
try
them
.
See
I
*NL*
read
here
what
Jonathan
have
written
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
other
of
his
race
who
,
in
a
later
age
,
again
and
again
,
brought
*NL*
his
forces
over
The
Great
River
into
Turkey
Land
;
who
,
when
he
was
*NL*
beaten
back
,
came
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
,
though
he
had
to
come
*NL*
alone
from
the
bloody
field
where
his
troops
were
being
slaughtered
,
*NL*
since
he
knew
that
he
alone
could
ultimately
triumph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
tell
us
?
Not
much
?
no
!
The
Count
's
child-thought
see
*NL*
nothing
;
therefore
he
speak
so
free
.
Your
man-thought
see
nothing
;
my
*NL*
man-thought
see
nothing
,
till
just
now
.
No
!
But
there
comes
another
word
*NL*
from
some
one
who
speak
without
thought
because
she
,
too
,
know
not
what
*NL*
it
mean
--
what
it
_
might
_
mean
.
Just
as
there
are
elements
which
rest
,
*NL*
yet
when
in
nature
's
course
they
move
on
their
way
and
they
touch
--
then
*NL*
pouf
!
and
there
comes
a
flash
of
light
,
heaven
wide
,
that
blind
and
kill
*NL*
and
destroy
some
;
but
that
show
up
all
earth
below
for
leagues
and
*NL*
leagues
.
Is
it
not
so
?
Well
,
I
shall
explain
.
To
begin
,
have
you
ever
*NL*
study
the
philosophy
of
crime
?
`
Yes
'
and
`
No
.
'
You
,
John
,
yes
;
for
it
is
*NL*
a
study
of
insanity
.
You
,
no
,
Madam
Mina
;
for
crime
touch
you
not
--
not
*NL*
but
once
.
Still
,
your
mind
works
true
,
and
argues
not
_
a
particulari
ad
*NL*
universale
_
.
There
is
this
peculiarity
in
criminals
.
It
is
so
constant
,
*NL*
in
all
countries
and
at
all
times
,
that
even
police
,
who
know
not
much
*NL*
from
philosophy
,
come
to
know
it
empirically
,
that
_
it
is
_
.
That
is
to
*NL*
be
empiric
.
The
criminal
always
work
at
one
crime
--
that
is
the
true
*NL*
criminal
who
seems
predestinate
to
crime
,
and
who
will
of
none
other
.
*NL*
This
criminal
has
not
full
man-brain
.
He
is
clever
and
cunning
and
*NL*
resourceful
;
but
he
be
not
of
man-stature
as
to
brain
.
He
be
of
*NL*
child-brain
in
much
.
Now
this
criminal
of
ours
is
predestinate
to
crime
*NL*
also
;
he
,
too
,
have
child-brain
,
and
it
is
of
the
child
to
do
what
he
*NL*
have
done
.
The
little
bird
,
the
little
fish
,
the
little
animal
learn
not
*NL*
by
principle
,
but
empirically
;
and
when
he
learn
to
do
,
then
there
is
to
*NL*
him
the
ground
to
start
from
to
do
more
.
'
_
Dos
pou
sto
_
,
'
said
*NL*
Archimedes
.
`
Give
me
a
fulcrum
,
and
I
shall
move
the
world
!
'
To
do
once
,
*NL*
is
the
fulcrum
whereby
child-brain
become
man-brain
;
and
until
he
have
*NL*
the
purpose
to
do
more
,
he
continue
to
do
the
same
again
every
time
,
*NL*
just
as
he
have
done
before
!
Oh
,
my
dear
,
I
see
that
your
eyes
are
*NL*
opened
,
and
that
to
you
the
lightning
flash
show
all
the
leagues
,
''
for
*NL*
Mrs.
Harker
began
to
clap
her
hands
and
her
eyes
sparkled
.
He
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
shall
speak
.
Tell
us
two
dry
men
of
science
what
you
see
with
*NL*
those
so
bright
eyes
.
''
He
took
her
hand
and
held
it
whilst
she
spoke
.
*NL*
His
finger
and
thumb
closed
on
her
pulse
,
as
I
thought
instinctively
and
*NL*
unconsciously
,
as
she
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Count
is
a
criminal
and
of
criminal
type
.
Nordau
and
Lombroso
would
*NL*
so
classify
him
,
and
_
qua
_
criminal
he
is
of
imperfectly
formed
mind
.
*NL*
Thus
,
in
a
difficulty
he
has
to
seek
resource
in
habit
.
His
past
is
a
*NL*
clue
,
and
the
one
page
of
it
that
we
know
--
and
that
from
his
own
*NL*
lips
--
tells
that
once
before
,
when
in
what
Mr.
Morris
would
call
a
*NL*
`
tight
place
,
'
he
went
back
to
his
own
country
from
the
land
he
had
*NL*
tried
to
invade
,
and
thence
,
without
losing
purpose
,
prepared
himself
*NL*
for
a
new
effort
.
He
came
again
better
equipped
for
his
work
;
and
won
.
*NL*
So
he
came
to
London
to
invade
a
new
land
.
He
was
beaten
,
and
when
all
*NL*
hope
of
success
was
lost
,
and
his
existence
in
danger
,
he
fled
back
over
*NL*
the
sea
to
his
home
;
just
as
formerly
he
had
fled
back
over
the
Danube
*NL*
from
Turkey
Land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
good
!
oh
,
you
so
clever
lady
!
''
said
Van
Helsing
,
*NL*
enthusiastically
,
as
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
hand
.
A
moment
later
he
*NL*
said
to
me
,
as
calmly
as
though
we
had
been
having
a
sick-room
*NL*
consultation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seventy-two
only
;
and
in
all
this
excitement
.
I
have
hope
.
''
Turning
to
*NL*
her
again
,
he
said
with
keen
expectation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
go
on
.
Go
on
!
there
is
more
to
tell
if
you
will
.
Be
not
afraid
;
*NL*
John
and
I
know
.
I
do
in
any
case
,
and
shall
tell
you
if
you
are
right
.
*NL*
Speak
,
without
fear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
to
;
but
you
will
forgive
me
if
I
seem
egotistical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
!
fear
not
,
you
must
be
egotist
,
for
it
is
of
you
that
we
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
as
he
is
criminal
he
is
selfish
;
and
as
his
intellect
is
small
*NL*
and
his
action
is
based
on
selfishness
,
he
confines
himself
to
one
*NL*
purpose
.
That
purpose
is
remorseless
.
As
he
fled
back
over
the
Danube
,
*NL*
leaving
his
forces
to
be
cut
to
pieces
,
so
now
he
is
intent
on
being
*NL*
safe
,
careless
of
all
.
So
his
own
selfishness
frees
my
soul
somewhat
*NL*
from
the
terrible
power
which
he
acquired
over
me
on
that
dreadful
*NL*
night
.
I
felt
it
!
Oh
,
I
felt
it
!
Thank
God
,
for
His
great
mercy
!
My
soul
*NL*
is
freer
than
it
has
been
since
that
awful
hour
;
and
all
that
haunts
me
*NL*
is
a
fear
lest
in
some
trance
or
dream
he
may
have
used
my
knowledge
for
*NL*
his
ends
.
''
The
Professor
stood
up
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
so
used
your
mind
;
and
by
it
he
has
left
us
here
in
Varna
,
*NL*
whilst
the
ship
that
carried
him
rushed
through
enveloping
fog
up
to
*NL*
Galatz
,
where
,
doubtless
,
he
had
made
preparation
for
escaping
from
us
.
*NL*
But
his
child-mind
only
saw
so
far
;
and
it
may
be
that
,
as
ever
is
in
*NL*
God
's
Providence
,
the
very
thing
that
the
evil-doer
most
reckoned
on
for
*NL*
his
selfish
good
,
turns
out
to
be
his
chiefest
harm
.
The
hunter
is
taken
*NL*
in
his
own
snare
,
as
the
great
Psalmist
says
.
For
now
that
he
think
he
*NL*
is
free
from
every
trace
of
us
all
,
and
that
he
has
escaped
us
with
so
*NL*
many
hours
to
him
,
then
his
selfish
child-brain
will
whisper
him
to
*NL*
sleep
.
He
think
,
too
,
that
as
he
cut
himself
off
from
knowing
your
mind
,
*NL*
there
can
be
no
knowledge
of
him
to
you
;
there
is
where
he
fail
!
That
*NL*
terrible
baptism
of
blood
which
he
give
you
makes
you
free
to
go
to
him
*NL*
in
spirit
,
as
you
have
as
yet
done
in
your
times
of
freedom
,
when
the
*NL*
sun
rise
and
set
.
At
such
times
you
go
by
my
volition
and
not
by
his
;
*NL*
and
this
power
to
good
of
you
and
others
,
as
you
have
won
from
your
*NL*
suffering
at
his
hands
.
This
is
now
all
the
more
precious
that
he
know
*NL*
it
not
,
and
to
guard
himself
have
even
cut
himself
off
from
his
*NL*
knowledge
of
our
where
.
We
,
however
,
are
not
selfish
,
and
we
believe
*NL*
that
God
is
with
us
through
all
this
blackness
,
and
these
many
dark
*NL*
hours
.
We
shall
follow
him
;
and
we
shall
not
flinch
;
even
if
we
peril
*NL*
ourselves
that
we
become
like
him
.
Friend
John
,
this
has
been
a
great
*NL*
hour
;
and
it
have
done
much
to
advance
us
on
our
way
.
You
must
be
scribe
*NL*
and
write
him
all
down
,
so
that
when
the
others
return
from
their
work
*NL*
you
can
give
it
to
them
;
then
they
shall
know
as
we
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
have
written
it
whilst
we
wait
their
return
,
and
Mrs.
Harker
*NL*
has
written
with
her
typewriter
all
since
she
brought
the
MS.
to
us

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
DR.
SEWARD
'S
DIARY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
29
October
.
_
--
This
is
written
in
the
train
from
Varna
to
Galatz
.
Last
*NL*
night
we
all
assembled
a
little
before
the
time
of
sunset
.
Each
of
us
*NL*
had
done
his
work
as
well
as
he
could
;
so
far
as
thought
,
and
endeavour
,
*NL*
and
opportunity
go
,
we
are
prepared
for
the
whole
of
our
journey
,
and
*NL*
for
our
work
when
we
get
to
Galatz
.
When
the
usual
time
came
round
Mrs.
*NL*
Harker
prepared
herself
for
her
hypnotic
effort
;
and
after
a
longer
and
*NL*
more
serious
effort
on
the
part
of
Van
Helsing
than
has
been
usually
*NL*
necessary
,
she
sank
into
the
trance
.
Usually
she
speaks
on
a
hint
;
but
*NL*
this
time
the
Professor
had
to
ask
her
questions
,
and
to
ask
them
pretty
*NL*
resolutely
,
before
we
could
learn
anything
;
at
last
her
answer
came
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
see
nothing
;
we
are
still
;
there
are
no
waves
lapping
,
but
only
a
*NL*
steady
swirl
of
water
softly
running
against
the
hawser
.
I
can
hear
*NL*
men
's
voices
calling
,
near
and
far
,
and
the
roll
and
creak
of
oars
in
*NL*
the
rowlocks
.
A
gun
is
fired
somewhere
;
the
echo
of
it
seems
far
away
.
*NL*
There
is
tramping
of
feet
overhead
,
and
ropes
and
chains
are
dragged
*NL*
along
.
What
is
this
?
There
is
a
gleam
of
light
;
I
can
feel
the
air
*NL*
blowing
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
stopped
.
She
had
risen
,
as
if
impulsively
,
from
where
she
lay
*NL*
on
the
sofa
,
and
raised
both
her
hands
,
palms
upwards
,
as
if
lifting
a
*NL*
weight
.
Van
Helsing
and
I
looked
at
each
other
with
understanding
.
*NL*
Quincey
raised
his
eyebrows
slightly
and
looked
at
her
intently
,
whilst
*NL*
Harker
's
hand
instinctively
closed
round
the
hilt
of
his
Kukri
.
There
*NL*
was
a
long
pause
.
We
all
knew
that
the
time
when
she
could
speak
was
*NL*
passing
;
but
we
felt
that
it
was
useless
to
say
anything
.
Suddenly
she
*NL*
sat
up
,
and
,
as
she
opened
her
eyes
,
said
sweetly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
none
of
you
like
a
cup
of
tea
?
You
must
all
be
so
tired
!
''
We
*NL*
could
only
make
her
happy
,
and
so
acquiesced
.
She
bustled
off
to
get
*NL*
tea
;
when
she
had
gone
Van
Helsing
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
friends
.
_
He
_
is
close
to
land
:
he
has
left
his
*NL*
earth-chest
.
But
he
has
yet
to
get
on
shore
.
In
the
night
he
may
lie
*NL*
hidden
somewhere
;
but
if
he
be
not
carried
on
shore
,
or
if
the
ship
do
*NL*
not
touch
it
,
he
can
not
achieve
the
land
.
In
such
case
he
can
,
if
it
be
*NL*
in
the
night
,
change
his
form
and
can
jump
or
fly
on
shore
,
as
he
did
*NL*
at
Whitby
.
But
if
the
day
come
before
he
get
on
shore
,
then
,
unless
he
*NL*
be
carried
he
can
not
escape
.
And
if
he
be
carried
,
then
the
customs
men
*NL*
may
discover
what
the
box
contain
.
Thus
,
in
fine
,
if
he
escape
not
on
*NL*
shore
to-night
,
or
before
dawn
,
there
will
be
the
whole
day
lost
to
him
.
*NL*
We
may
then
arrive
in
time
;
for
if
he
escape
not
at
night
we
shall
come
*NL*
on
him
in
daytime
,
boxed
up
and
at
our
mercy
;
for
he
dare
not
be
his
*NL*
true
self
,
awake
and
visible
,
lest
he
be
discovered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
more
to
be
said
,
so
we
waited
in
patience
until
the
dawn
;
*NL*
at
which
time
we
might
learn
more
from
Mrs.
Harker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
this
morning
we
listened
,
with
breathless
anxiety
,
for
her
*NL*
response
in
her
trance
.
The
hypnotic
stage
was
even
longer
in
coming
*NL*
than
before
;
and
when
it
came
the
time
remaining
until
full
sunrise
was
*NL*
so
short
that
we
began
to
despair
.
Van
Helsing
seemed
to
throw
his
whole
*NL*
soul
into
the
effort
;
at
last
,
in
obedience
to
his
will
she
made
*NL*
reply
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
dark
.
I
hear
lapping
water
,
level
with
me
,
and
some
creaking
as
*NL*
of
wood
on
wood
.
''
She
paused
,
and
the
red
sun
shot
up
.
We
must
wait
till
*NL*
to-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
is
that
we
are
travelling
towards
Galatz
in
an
agony
of
*NL*
expectation
.
We
are
due
to
arrive
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
;
*NL*
but
already
,
at
Bucharest
,
we
are
three
hours
late
,
so
we
can
not
*NL*
possibly
get
in
till
well
after
sun-up
.
Thus
we
shall
have
two
more
*NL*
hypnotic
messages
from
Mrs.
Harker
;
either
or
both
may
possibly
throw
*NL*
more
light
on
what
is
happening
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
_
Later
.
_
--
Sunset
has
come
and
gone
.
Fortunately
it
came
at
a
time
when
*NL*
there
was
no
distraction
;
for
had
it
occurred
whilst
we
were
at
a
*NL*
station
,
we
might
not
have
secured
the
necessary
calm
and
isolation
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Harker
yielded
to
the
hypnotic
influence
even
less
readily
than
*NL*
this
morning
.
I
am
in
fear
that
her
power
of
reading
the
Count
's
*NL*
sensations
may
die
away
,
just
when
we
want
it
most
.
It
seems
to
me
that
*NL*
her
imagination
is
beginning
to
work
.
Whilst
she
has
been
in
the
trance
*NL*
hitherto
she
has
confined
herself
to
the
simplest
of
facts
.
If
this
goes
*NL*
on
it
may
ultimately
mislead
us
.
If
I
thought
that
the
Count
's
power
*NL*
over
her
would
die
away
equally
with
her
power
of
knowledge
it
would
be
*NL*
a
happy
thought
;
but
I
am
afraid
that
it
may
not
be
so
.
When
she
did
*NL*
speak
,
her
words
were
enigmatical
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
is
going
out
;
I
can
feel
it
pass
me
like
a
cold
wind
.
I
can
*NL*
hear
,
far
off
,
confused
sounds
--
as
of
men
talking
in
strange
tongues
,
*NL*
fierce-falling
water
,
and
the
howling
of
wolves
.
''
She
stopped
and
a
*NL*
shudder
ran
through
her
,
increasing
in
intensity
for
a
few
seconds
,
*NL*
till
,
at
the
end
,
she
shook
as
though
in
a
palsy
.
She
said
no
more
,
even
*NL*
in
answer
to
the
Professor
's
imperative
questioning
.
When
she
woke
from
*NL*
the
trance
,
she
was
cold
,
and
exhausted
,
and
languid
;
but
her
mind
was
*NL*
all
alert
.
She
could
not
remember
anything
,
but
asked
what
she
had
said
;
*NL*
when
she
was
told
,
she
pondered
over
it
deeply
for
a
long
time
and
in
*NL*
silence
.

We
are
near
Galatz
now
,
and
I
may
not
have
time
*NL*
to
write
later
.
Sunrise
this
morning
was
anxiously
looked
for
by
us
all
.
*NL*
Knowing
of
the
increasing
difficulty
of
procuring
the
hypnotic
trance
,
*NL*
Van
Helsing
began
his
passes
earlier
than
usual
.
They
produced
no
*NL*
effect
,
however
,
until
the
regular
time
,
when
she
yielded
with
a
still
*NL*
greater
difficulty
,
only
a
minute
before
the
sun
rose
.
The
Professor
*NL*
lost
no
time
in
his
questioning
;
her
answer
came
with
equal
quickness
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
dark
.
I
hear
water
swirling
by
,
level
with
my
ears
,
and
the
*NL*
creaking
of
wood
on
wood
.
Cattle
low
far
off
.
There
is
another
sound
,
a
*NL*
queer
one
like
--
''
She
stopped
and
grew
white
,
and
whiter
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
;
go
on
!
Speak
,
I
command
you
!
''
said
Van
Helsing
in
an
agonised
*NL*
voice
.
At
the
same
time
there
was
despair
in
his
eyes
,
for
the
risen
sun
*NL*
was
reddening
even
Mrs.
Harker
's
pale
face
.
She
opened
her
eyes
,
and
we
*NL*
all
started
as
she
said
,
sweetly
and
seemingly
with
the
utmost
*NL*
unconcern
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Professor
,
why
ask
me
to
do
what
you
know
I
ca
n't
?
I
do
n't
remember
*NL*
anything
.
''
Then
,
seeing
the
look
of
amazement
on
our
faces
,
she
said
,
*NL*
turning
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
troubled
look
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
said
?
What
have
I
done
?
I
know
nothing
,
only
that
I
was
*NL*
lying
here
,
half
asleep
,
and
heard
you
say
go
on
!
speak
,
I
command
you
!
'
*NL*
It
seemed
so
funny
to
hear
you
order
me
about
,
as
if
I
were
a
bad
*NL*
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Madam
Mina
,
''
he
said
,
sadly
,
``
it
is
proof
,
if
proof
be
needed
,
of
*NL*
how
I
love
and
honour
you
,
when
a
word
for
your
good
,
spoken
more
*NL*
earnest
than
ever
,
can
seem
so
strange
because
it
is
to
order
her
whom
I
*NL*
am
proud
to
obey
!

*NL*
The
whistles
are
sounding
;
we
are
nearing
Galatz

We
are
on
fire
with
*NL*
anxiety
and
eagerness

Mr.

took
me
to

where
our
rooms
had
been

ordered
by
telegraph
,
he
being
the
one
who
could
best
be
spared
,
since
*NL*
he
does
not
speak
any
foreign
language

The
forces
were
distributed
*NL*
much
as
they
had
been
at
Varna

except
that
Lord
Godalming
went
to
the

his
rank
might
serve
as
an
immediate

of
some

to

we
being
in

Jonathan

the

At
nine
o'clock
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
Dr.
Seward
,
and
I
called
*NL*
on
Messrs.
Mackenzie
&
Steinkoff
,
the
agents
of
the
London
firm
of
*NL*
Hapgood
.
They
had
received
a
wire
from
London
,
in
answer
to
Lord
*NL*
Godalming
's
telegraphed
request
,
asking
us
to
show
them
any
civility
in
*NL*
their
power
.
They
were
more
than
kind
and
courteous
,
and
took
us
at
once
*NL*
on
board
the
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
,
which
lay
at
anchor
out
in
the
river
*NL*
harbour
.
There
we
saw
the
Captain
,
Donelson
by
name
,
who
told
us
of
his
*NL*
voyage
.
He
said
that
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
had
so
favourable
a
*NL*
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man

he
said

``
but
it
made
us
afeard
,
for
we
expeckit
that
we
should
*NL*
have
to
pay
for
it
wi
'
some
rare
piece
o
'
ill
luck
,
so
as
to
keep
up
the
*NL*
average
.
It
's
no
canny
to
run
frae
London
to
the
Black
Sea
wi
'
a
wind
*NL*
ahint
ye
,
as
though
the
Deil
himself
were
blawin
'
on
yer
sail
for
his
*NL*
ain
purpose
.
An
'
a
'
the
time
we
could
no
speer
a
thing
.
Gin
we
were
nigh
*NL*
a
ship
,
or
a
port
,
or
a
headland
,
a
fog
fell
on
us
and
travelled
wi
'
us
,
*NL*
till
when
after
it
had
lifted
and
we
looked
out
,
the
deil
a
thing
could
*NL*
we
see
.
We
ran
by
Gibraltar
wi'oot
bein
'
able
to
signal
;
an
'
till
we
*NL*
came
to
the
Dardanelles
and
had
to
wait
to
get
our
permit
to
pass
,
we
*NL*
never
were
within
hail
o
'
aught
.
At
first
I
inclined
to
slack
off
sail
*NL*
and
beat
about
till
the
fog
was
lifted
;
but
whiles
,
I
thocht
that
if
the
*NL*
Deil
was
minded
to
get
us
into
the
Black
Sea
quick
,
he
was
like
to
do
it
*NL*
whether
we
would
or
no
.
If
we
had
a
quick
voyage
it
would
be
no
to
our
*NL*
miscredit
wi
'
the
owners
,
or
no
hurt
to
our
traffic
;
an
'
the
Old
Mon
who
*NL*
had
served
his
ain
purpose
wad
be
decently
grateful
to
us
for
no
*NL*
hinderin
'
him
.
''
This
mixture
of
simplicity
and
cunning
,
of
superstition
*NL*
and
commercial
reasoning
,
aroused
Van
Helsing
,
who
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
friend
,
that
Devil
is
more
clever
than
he
is
thought
by
some
;
and
*NL*
he
know
when
he
meet
his
match
!
''
The
skipper
was
not
displeased
with
the
*NL*
compliment
,
and
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
got
past
the
Bosphorus
the
men
began
to
grumble
;
some
o
'
them
,
*NL*
the
Roumanians
,
came
and
asked
me
to
heave
overboard
a
big
box
which
had
*NL*
been
put
on
board
by
a
queer
lookin
'
old
man
just
before
we
had
started
*NL*
frae
London
.
I
had
seen
them
speer
at
the
fellow
,
and
put
out
their
twa
*NL*
fingers
when
they
saw
him
,
to
guard
against
the
evil
eye
.
Man
!
but
the
*NL*
supersteetion
of
foreigners
is
pairfectly
rideeculous
!
I
sent
them
aboot
*NL*
their
business
pretty
quick
;
but
as
just
after
a
fog
closed
in
on
us
I
*NL*
felt
a
wee
bit
as
they
did
anent
something
,
though
I
would
n't
say
it
was
*NL*
agin
the
big
box
.
Well
,
on
we
went
,
and
as
the
fog
did
n't
let
up
for
*NL*
five
days
I
joost
let
the
wind
carry
us
;
for
if
the
Deil
wanted
to
get
*NL*
somewheres
--
well
,
he
would
fetch
it
up
a
`
reet
.
An
'
if
he
did
n't
,
well
,
*NL*
we
'd
keep
a
sharp
lookout
anyhow
.
Sure
eneuch
,
we
had
a
fair
way
and
*NL*
deep
water
all
the
time
;
and
two
days
ago
,
when
the
mornin
'
sun
came
*NL*
through
the
fog
,
we
found
ourselves
just
in
the
river
opposite
Galatz
.
*NL*
The
Roumanians
were
wild
,
and
wanted
me
right
or
wrong
to
take
out
the
*NL*
box
and
fling
it
in
the
river
.
I
had
to
argy
wi
'
them
aboot
it
wi
'
a
*NL*
handspike
;
an
'
when
the
last
o
'
them
rose
off
the
deck
wi
'
his
head
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
I
had
convinced
them
that
,
evil
eye
or
no
evil
eye
,
the
*NL*
property
and
the
trust
of
my
owners
were
better
in
my
hands
than
in
the
*NL*
river
Danube
.
They
had
,
mind
ye
,
taken
the
box
on
the
deck
ready
to
*NL*
fling
in
,
and
as
it
was
marked
Galatz
_
via
_
Varna
,
I
thocht
I
'd
let
it
*NL*
lie
till
we
discharged
in
the
port
an
'
get
rid
o
'
t
althegither
.
We
*NL*
did
n't
do
much
clearin
'
that
day
,
an
'
had
to
remain
the
nicht
at
anchor
;
*NL*
but
in
the
mornin
'
,
braw
an
'
airly
,
an
hour
before
sun-up
,
a
man
came
*NL*
aboard
wi
'
an
order
,
written
to
him
from
England
,
to
receive
a
box
*NL*
marked
for
one
Count
Dracula
.
Sure
eneuch
the
matter
was
one
ready
to
*NL*
his
hand
.
He
had
his
papers
a
'
reet
,
an
'
glad
I
was
to
be
rid
o
'
the
*NL*
dam
'
thing
,
for
I
was
beginnin
'
masel
'
to
feel
uneasy
at
it
.
If
the
Deil
*NL*
did
have
any
luggage
aboord
the
ship
,
I
'm
thinkin
'
it
was
nane
ither
*NL*
than
that
same
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
name
of
the
man
who
took
it
?
''
asked
Dr.
Van
Helsing
with
*NL*
restrained
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
tellin
'
ye
quick
!
''
he
answered
,
and
,
stepping
down
to
his
*NL*
cabin
,
produced
a
receipt
signed
``
Immanuel
Hildesheim
.
''
Burgen-strasse
*NL*
16
was
the
address
.
We
found
out
that
this
was
all
the
Captain
knew
;
so
*NL*
with
thanks
we
came
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
Hildesheim
in
his
office
,
a
Hebrew
of
rather
the
Adelphi
*NL*
Theatre
type
,
with
a
nose
like
a
sheep
,
and
a
fez
.
His
arguments
were
*NL*
pointed
with
specie
--
we
doing
the
punctuation
--
and
with
a
little
*NL*
bargaining
he
told
us
what
he
knew
.
This
turned
out
to
be
simple
but
*NL*
important
.
He
had
received
a
letter
from
Mr.
de
Ville
of
London
,
telling
*NL*
him
to
receive
,
if
possible
before
sunrise
so
as
to
avoid
customs
,
a
box
*NL*
which
would
arrive
at
Galatz
in
the
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
.
This
he
was
to
*NL*
give
in
charge
to
a
certain
Petrof
Skinsky
,
who
dealt
with
the
Slovaks
*NL*
who
traded
down
the
river
to
the
port
.
He
had
been
paid
for
his
work
by
*NL*
an
English
bank
note
,
which
had
been
duly
cashed
for
gold
at
the
Danube
*NL*
International
Bank
.
When
Skinsky
had
come
to
him
,
he
had
taken
him
to
*NL*
the
ship
and
handed
over
the
box
,
so
as
to
save
porterage
.
That
was
all
*NL*
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
then
sought
for
Skinsky
,
but
were
unable
to
find
him
.
One
of
his
*NL*
neighbours
,
who
did
not
seem
to
bear
him
any
affection
,
said
that
he
had
*NL*
gone
away
two
days
before
,
no
one
knew
whither
.
This
was
corroborated
by
*NL*
his
landlord
,
who
had
received
by
messenger
the
key
of
the
house
*NL*
together
with
the
rent
due
,
in
English
money
.
This
had
been
between
ten
*NL*
and
eleven
o'clock
last
night
.
We
were
at
a
standstill
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
we
were
talking
one
came
running
and
breathlessly
gasped
out
that
*NL*
the
body
of
Skinsky
had
been
found
inside
the
wall
of
the
churchyard
of
*NL*
St.
Peter
,
and
that
the
throat
had
been
torn
open
as
if
by
some
wild
*NL*
animal
.
Those
we
had
been
speaking
with
ran
off
to
see
the
horror
,
the
*NL*
women
crying
out
``
This
is
the
work
of
a
Slovak
!
''
We
hurried
away
lest
we
*NL*
should
have
been
in
some
way
drawn
into
the
affair
,
and
so
detained
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
came
home
we
could
arrive
at
no
definite
conclusion
.
We
were
all
*NL*
convinced
that
the
box
was
on
its
way
,
by
water
,
to
somewhere
;
but
where
*NL*
that
might
be
we
would
have
to
discover
.
With
heavy
hearts
we
came
home
*NL*
to
the
hotel
to
Mina
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
met
together
,
the
first
thing
was
to
consult
as
to
taking
Mina
*NL*
again
into
our
confidence
.
Things
are
getting
desperate
,
and
it
is
at
*NL*
least
a
chance
,
though
a
hazardous
one
.
As
a
preliminary
step
,
I
was
*NL*
released
from
my
promise
to
her

They
were
so
tired
and
worn
out
and
dispirited
*NL*
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
till
they
had
some
rest
;
so
I
asked
*NL*
them
all
to
lie
down
for
half
an
hour
whilst
I
should
enter
everything
*NL*
up
to
the
moment
.
I
feel
so
grateful
to
the
man
who
invented
the
*NL*
``
Traveller
's
''
typewriter
,
and
to
Mr.
Morris
for
getting
this
one
for
*NL*
me
.
I
should
have
felt
quite
;
astray
doing
the
work
if
I
had
to
write
*NL*
with
a
pen
...
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
all
done
;
poor
dear
,
dear
Jonathan
,
what
he
must
have
suffered
,
*NL*
what
must
he
be
suffering
now
.
He
lies
on
the
sofa
hardly
seeming
to
*NL*
breathe
,
and
his
whole
body
appears
in
collapse
.
His
brows
are
knit
;
his
*NL*
face
is
drawn
with
pain
.
Poor
fellow
,
maybe
he
is
thinking
,
and
I
can
*NL*
see
his
face
all
wrinkled
up
with
the
concentration
of
his
thoughts
.
Oh
!
*NL*
if
I
could
only
help
at
all
...
I
shall
do
what
I
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
asked
Dr.
Van
Helsing
,
and
he
has
got
me
all
the
papers
that
I
*NL*
have
not
yet
seen
...
Whilst
they
are
resting
,
I
shall
go
over
all
*NL*
carefully
,
and
perhaps
I
may
arrive
at
some
conclusion
.
I
shall
try
to
*NL*
follow
the
Professor
's
example
,
and
think
without
prejudice
on
the
facts
*NL*
before
me
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
believe
that
under
God
's
providence
I
have
made
a
discovery
.
I
*NL*
shall
get
the
maps
and
look
over
them
...
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
more
than
ever
sure
that
I
am
right
.
My
new
conclusion
is
ready
,
so
*NL*
I
shall
get
our
party
together
and
read
it
.
They
can
judge
it
;
it
is
*NL*
well
to
be
accurate
,
and
every
minute
is
precious

would
be
fatal
,
with
enemies

True

he

escape
at

what
would
he
be
,
if

left
in
a
strange
place
with
no
refuge
that
he
could
fly

By

.
_
--
Here
is
the
safest
way
,
in
one
respect
,
but
with
most
*NL*
danger
in
another
.
On
the
water
he
is
powerless
except
at
night
;
even
*NL*
then
he
can
only
summon
fog
and
storm
and
snow
and
his
wolves
.
But
were
*NL*
he
wrecked
,
the
living
water
would
engulf
him
,
helpless
;
and
he
would
*NL*
indeed
be
lost
.
He
could
have
the
vessel
drive
to
land
;
but
if
it
were
*NL*
unfriendly
land
,
wherein
he
was
not
free
to
move
,
his
position
would
*NL*
still
be
desperate
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
know
from
the
record
that
he
was
on
the
water
;
so
what
we
have
to
do
*NL*
is
to
ascertain
_
what
_
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
is
to
realise
exactly
what
he
has
done
as
yet
;
we
may
,
*NL*
then
,
get
a
light
on
what
his
later
task
is
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Firstly
.
_
--
We
must
differentiate
between
what
he
did
in
London
as
part
*NL*
of
his
general
plan
of
action
,
when
he
was
pressed
for
moments
and
had
*NL*
to
arrange
as
best
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Secondly
_
we
must
see
,
as
well
as
we
can
surmise
it
from
the
facts
we
*NL*
know
of
,
what
he
has
done
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
first
,
he
evidently
intended
to
arrive
at
Galatz
,
and
sent
*NL*
invoice
to
Varna
to
deceive
us
lest
we
should
ascertain
his
means
of
*NL*
exit
from
England
;
his
immediate
and
sole
purpose
then
was
to
escape
.
*NL*
The
proof
of
this
,
is
the
letter
of
instructions
sent
to
Immanuel
*NL*
Hildesheim
to
clear
and
take
away
the
box
_
before
sunrise
_
.
There
is
*NL*
also
the
instruction
to
Petrof
Skinsky
.
These
we
must
only
guess
at
;
but
*NL*
there
must
have
been
some
letter
or
message
,
since
Skinsky
came
to
*NL*
Hildesheim
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
,
so
far
,
his
plans
were
successful
we
know
.
The
_
Czarina
Catherine
_
*NL*
made
a
phenomenally
quick
journey
--
so
much
so
that
Captain
Donelson
's
*NL*
suspicions
were
aroused
;
but
his
superstition
united
with
his
canniness
*NL*
played
the
Count
's
game
for
him
,
and
he
ran
with
his
favouring
wind
*NL*
through
fogs
and
all
till
he
brought
up
blindfold
at
Galatz
.
That
the
*NL*
Count
's
arrangements
were
well
made
,
has
been
proved
.
Hildesheim
cleared
*NL*
the
box
,
took
it
off
,
and
gave
it
to
Skinsky
.
Skinsky
took
it
--
and
here
*NL*
we
lose
the
trail
.
We
only
know
that
the
box
is
somewhere
on
the
water
,
*NL*
moving
along
.
The
customs
and
the
octroi
,
if
there
be
any
,
have
been
*NL*
avoided
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
we
come
to
what
the
Count
must
have
done
after
his
arrival
--
_
on
*NL*
land
_
,
at
Galatz
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
box
was
given
to
Skinsky
before
sunrise
.
At
sunrise
the
Count
could
*NL*
appear
in
his
own
form
.
Here
,
we
ask
why
Skinsky
was
chosen
at
all
to
*NL*
aid
in
the
work
?
In
my
husband
's
diary
,
Skinsky
is
mentioned
as
dealing
*NL*
with
the
Slovaks
who
trade
down
the
river
to
the
port
;
and
the
man
's
*NL*
remark
,
that
the
murder
was
the
work
of
a
Slovak
,
showed
the
general
*NL*
feeling
against
his
class
.
The
Count
wanted
isolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
surmise
is
,
this
:
that
in
London
the
Count
decided
to
get
back
to
his
*NL*
castle
by
water
,
as
the
most
safe
and
secret
way
.
He
was
brought
from
*NL*
the
castle
by
Szgany
,
and
probably
they
delivered
their
cargo
to
Slovaks
*NL*
who
took
the
boxes
to
Varna
,
for
there
they
were
shipped
for
London
.
*NL*
Thus
the
Count
had
knowledge
of
the
persons
who
could
arrange
this
*NL*
service
.
When
the
box
was
on
land
,
before
sunrise
or
after
sunset
,
he
*NL*
came
out
from
his
box
,
met
Skinsky
and
instructed
him
what
to
do
as
to
*NL*
arranging
the
carriage
of
the
box
up
some
river
.
When
this
was
done
,
and
*NL*
he
knew
that
all
was
in
train
,
he
blotted
out
his
traces
,
as
he
thought
,
*NL*
by
murdering
his
agent
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
examined
the
map
and
find
that
the
river
most
suitable
for
the
*NL*
Slovaks
to
have
ascended
is
either
the
Pruth
or
the
Sereth
.
I
read
in
*NL*
the
typescript
that
in
my
trance
I
heard
cows
low
and
water
swirling
*NL*
level
with
my
ears
and
the
creaking
of
wood
.
The
Count
in
his
box
,
then
,
*NL*
was
on
a
river
in
an
open
boat
--
propelled
probably
either
by
oars
or
*NL*
poles
,
for
the
banks
are
near
and
it
is
working
against
stream
.
There
*NL*
would
be
no
such
sound
if
floating
down
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
it
may
not
be
either
the
Sereth
or
the
Pruth
,
but
we
may
*NL*
possibly
investigate
further
.
Now
of
these
two
,
the
Pruth
is
the
more
*NL*
easily
navigated
,
but
the
Sereth
is
,
at
Fundu
,
joined
by
the
Bistritza
*NL*
which
runs
up
round
the
Borgo
Pass
.
The
loop
it
makes
is
manifestly
as
*NL*
close
to
Dracula
's
castle
as
can
be
got
by
water
.

When
I
had
done
reading
,
Jonathan
took
me
in
his
arms
and
kissed
me
.
The
*NL*
others
kept
shaking
me
by
both
hands
,
and
Dr.
Van
Helsing
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
dear
Madam
Mina
is
once
more
our
teacher
.
Her
eyes
have
been
where
*NL*
we
were
blinded
.
Now
we
are
on
the
track
once
again
,
and
this
time
we
*NL*
may
succeed
.
Our
enemy
is
at
his
most
helpless
;
and
if
we
can
come
on
*NL*
him
by
day
,
on
the
water
,
our
task
will
be
over
.
He
has
a
start
,
but
he
*NL*
is
powerless
to
hasten
,
as
he
may
not
leave
his
box
lest
those
who
carry
*NL*
him
may
suspect
;
for
them
to
suspect
would
be
to
prompt
them
to
throw
*NL*
him
in
the
stream
where
he
perish
.
This
he
knows
,
and
will
not
.
Now
men
,
*NL*
to
our
Council
of
War
;
for
,
here
and
now
,
we
must
plan
what
each
and
all
*NL*
shall
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
get
a
steam
launch
and
follow
him
,
''
said
Lord
Godalming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
horses
to
follow
on
the
bank
lest
by
chance
he
land
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Morris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
the
Professor
,
``
both
good
.
But
neither
must
go
alone
.
There
*NL*
must
be
force
to
overcome
force
if
need
be
;
the
Slovak
is
strong
and
*NL*
rough
,
and
he
carries
rude
arms
.
''
All
the
men
smiled
,
for
amongst
them
*NL*
they
carried
a
small
arsenal
.
Said
Mr.
Morris
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
brought
some
Winchesters
;
they
are
pretty
handy
in
a
crowd
,
and
*NL*
there
may
be
wolves
.
The
Count
,
if
you
remember
,
took
some
other
*NL*
precautions
;
he
made
some
requisitions
on
others
that
Mrs.
Harker
could
*NL*
not
quite
hear
or
understand
.
We
must
be
ready
at
all
points
.
''
Dr.
*NL*
Seward
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
had
better
go
with
Quincey
.
We
have
been
accustomed
to
hunt
*NL*
together
,
and
we
two
,
well
armed
,
will
be
a
match
for
whatever
may
come
*NL*
along
.
You
must
not
be
alone
,
Art
.
It
may
be
necessary
to
fight
the
*NL*
Slovaks
,
and
a
chance
thrust
--
for
I
do
n't
suppose
these
fellows
carry
*NL*
guns
--
would
undo
all
our
plans
.
There
must
be
no
chances
,
this
time
;
we
*NL*
shall
,
not
rest
until
the
Count
's
head
and
body
have
been
separated
,
and
*NL*
we
are
sure
that
he
can
not
re-incarnate
.
''
He
looked
at
Jonathan
as
he
*NL*
spoke
,
and
Jonathan
looked
at
me
.
I
could
see
that
the
poor
dear
was
*NL*
torn
about
in
his
mind
.
Of
course
he
wanted
to
be
with
me
;
but
then
the
*NL*
boat
service
would
,
most
likely
,
be
the
one
which
would
destroy
the
...
*NL*
the
...
the
...
Vampire
.
-LRB-
Why
did
I
hesitate
to
write
the
word
?
-RRB-
He
was
*NL*
silent
awhile
,
and
during
his
silence
Dr.
Van
Helsing
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
Jonathan
,
this
is
to
you
for
twice
reasons
.
First
,
because
you
*NL*
are
young
and
brave
and
can
fight
,
and
all
energies
may
be
needed
at
the
*NL*
last
;
and
again
that
it
is
your
right
to
destroy
him
--
that
--
which
has
*NL*
wrought
such
woe
to
you
and
yours
.
Be
not
afraid
for
Madam
Mina
;
she
*NL*
will
be
my
care
,
if
I
may
.
I
am
old
.
My
legs
are
not
so
quick
to
run
as
*NL*
once
;
and
I
am
not
used
to
ride
so
long
or
to
pursue
as
need
be
,
or
to
*NL*
fight
with
lethal
weapons
.
But
I
can
be
of
other
service
;
I
can
fight
in
*NL*
other
way
.
And
I
can
die
,
if
need
be
,
as
well
as
younger
men
.
Now
let
*NL*
me
say
that
what
I
would
is
this
:
while
you
,
my
Lord
Godalming
and
*NL*
friend
Jonathan
go
in
your
so
swift
little
steamboat
up
the
river
,
and
*NL*
whilst
John
and
Quincey
guard
the
bank
where
perchance
he
might
be
*NL*
landed
,
I
will
take
Madam
Mina
right
into
the
heart
of
the
enemy
's
*NL*
country
.
Whilst
the
old
fox
is
tied
in
his
box
,
floating
on
the
running
*NL*
stream
whence
he
can
not
escape
to
land
--
where
he
dares
not
raise
the
lid
*NL*
of
his
coffin-box
lest
his
Slovak
carriers
should
in
fear
leave
him
to
*NL*
perish
--
we
shall
go
in
the
track
where
Jonathan
went
,
--
from
Bistritz
*NL*
over
the
Borgo
,
and
find
our
way
to
the
Castle
of
Dracula
.
Here
,
Madam
*NL*
Mina
's
hypnotic
power
will
surely
help
,
and
we
shall
find
our
way
--
all
*NL*
dark
and
unknown
otherwise
--
after
the
first
sunrise
when
we
are
near
*NL*
that
fateful
place
.
There
is
much
to
be
done
,
and
other
places
to
be
*NL*
made
sanctify
,
so
that
that
nest
of
vipers
be
obliterated
.
''
Here
*NL*
Jonathan
interrupted
him
hotly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
Professor
Van
Helsing
,
that
you
would
bring
Mina
,
*NL*
in
her
sad
case
and
tainted
as
she
is
with
that
devil
's
illness
,
right
*NL*
into
the
jaws
of
his
death-trap
?
Not
for
the
world
!
Not
for
Heaven
or
*NL*
Hell
!
''
He
became
almost
speechless
for
a
minute
,
and
then
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
the
place
is
?
Have
you
seen
that
awful
den
of
hellish
*NL*
infamy
--
with
the
very
moonlight
alive
with
grisly
shapes
,
and
every
*NL*
speck
of
dust
that
whirls
in
the
wind
a
devouring
monster
in
embryo
?
*NL*
Have
you
felt
the
Vampire
's
lips
upon
your
throat
?
''
Here
he
turned
to
*NL*
me
,
and
as
his
eyes
lit
on
my
forehead
he
threw
up
his
arms
with
a
cry
:
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
,
what
have
we
done
to
have
this
terror
upon
us
!
''
and
he
sank
*NL*
down
on
the
sofa
in
a
collapse
of
misery
.
The
Professor
's
voice
,
as
he
*NL*
spoke
in
clear
,
sweet
tones
,
which
seemed
to
vibrate
in
the
air
,
calmed
*NL*
us
all
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
friend
,
it
is
because
I
would
save
Madam
Mina
from
that
awful
*NL*
place
that
I
would
go
.
God
forbid
that
I
should
take
her
into
that
*NL*
place
.
There
is
work
--
wild
work
--
to
be
done
there
,
that
her
eyes
may
not
*NL*
see
.
We
men
here
,
all
save
Jonathan
,
have
seen
with
their
own
eyes
what
*NL*
is
to
be
done
before
that
place
can
be
purify
.
Remember
that
we
are
in
*NL*
terrible
straits
.
If
the
Count
escape
us
this
time
--
and
he
is
strong
and
*NL*
subtle
and
cunning
--
he
may
choose
to
sleep
him
for
a
century
,
and
then
*NL*
in
time
our
dear
one
''
--
he
took
my
hand
--
``
would
come
to
him
to
keep
him
*NL*
company
,
and
would
be
as
those
others
that
you
,
Jonathan
,
saw
.
You
have
*NL*
told
us
of
their
gloating
lips
;
you
heard
their
ribald
laugh
as
they
*NL*
clutched
the
moving
bag
that
the
Count
threw
to
them
.
You
shudder
;
and
*NL*
well
may
it
be

Forgive
me
that
I
make
you
so
much
pain
,
but
it
is

necessary

My

is
it
not
a
dire
need
for
the
which
I
am
giving

my

Oh

it

me
good
to
see
the
way

these
brave
men
worked

How
can
women
help
loving
men
when
they
are
so
earnest
,
and
so
true
,
and
*NL*
so
brave
!
And
,
too
,
it
made
me
think
of
the
wonderful
power
of
money
!
*NL*
What
can
it
not
do
when
it
is
properly
applied
;
and
what
might
it
do
*NL*
when
basely
used
.
I
felt
so
thankful
that
Lord
Godalming
is
rich
,
and
*NL*
that
both
he
and
Mr.
Morris
,
who
also
has
plenty
of
money

are
willing

to
spend
it
so
freely

For
if
they
did
not

could
*NL*
not
start

either
so
promptly
or
so
well
equipped

as
it
will
within

another

It
is
not
three
hours

it
was
arranged
what
part
each
*NL*
of
us
was
to
do
;
and
now
Lord
Godalming

Jonathan
have
a
lovely
steam

with
steam
up

Dr.

where
we

to
get
a
carriage
to
drive
to

We

bringing

money

We
shall
drive
ourselves

for
we

The

knows
something
of
a
great
many

*NL*
so
we
shall
get
on
all
right

We
have
all
got
arms

even
for
me
a

large-bore
revolver

Jonathan
would
not

I
was
armed

Alas

I
can
not
carry
one
arm
that
the
rest
do
;
the
scar
on
my

forehead
forbids
that
.
Dear
Dr.
Van

comforts
me
by
telling
me

that
I
am
fully
armed

there
may

darling

We
may
*NL*
never
meet
again

Courage
,
Mina
!
the
Professor
is
looking
at
you
keenly
;
*NL*
his
look
is
a
warning
.
There
must
be
no
tears
now
--
unless
it
may
be
that
*NL*
God
will
let
them
fall
in
gladness

Night

_
--
I
am
writing
this
in
the
light
from
the
furnace
*NL*
door
of
the
steam
launch
:
Lord
Godalming
is
firing
up
.
He
is
an
*NL*
experienced
hand
at
the
work
,
as
he
has
had
for
years
a
launch
of
his
*NL*
own
on
the
Thames
,
and
another
on
the
Norfolk
Broads
.
Regarding
our
*NL*
plans
,
we
finally
decided
that
Mina
's
guess
was
correct
,
and
that
if
any
*NL*
waterway
was
chosen
for
the
Count
's
escape
back
to
his
Castle
,
the
*NL*
Sereth
and
then
the
Bistritza
at
its
junction
,
would
be
the
one
.
We
took
*NL*
it
,
that
somewhere
about
the
47th
degree
,
north
latitude
,
would
be
the
*NL*
place
chosen
for
the
crossing
the
country
between
the
river
and
the
*NL*
Carpathians
.
We
have
no
fear
in
running
at
good
speed
up
the
river
at
*NL*
night
;
there
is
plenty
of
water
,
and
the
banks
are
wide
enough
apart
to
*NL*
make
steaming
,
even
in
the
dark
,
easy
enough
.
Lord
Godalming
tells
me
to
*NL*
sleep
for
a
while
,
as
it
is
enough
for
the
present
for
one
to
be
on
*NL*
watch
.
But
I
can
not
sleep
--
how
can
I
with
the
terrible
danger
hanging
*NL*
over
my
darling
,
and
her
going
out
into
that
awful
place
...
My
only
*NL*
comfort
is
that
we
are
in
the
hands
of
God
.
Only
for
that
faith
it
would
*NL*
be
easier
to
die
than
to
live
,
and
so
be
quit
of
all
the
trouble
.
Mr.
*NL*
Morris
and
Dr.
Seward
were
off
on
their
long
ride
before
we
started
;
*NL*
they
are
to
keep
up
the
right
bank
,
far
enough
off
to
get
on
higher
*NL*
lands
where
they
can
see
a
good
stretch
of
river
and
avoid
the
following
*NL*
of
its
curves
.
They
have
,
for
the
first
stages
,
two
men
to
ride
and
lead
*NL*
their
spare
horses
--
four
in
all
,
so
as
not
to
excite
curiosity
.
When
*NL*
they
dismiss
the
men
,
which
shall
be
shortly
,
they
shall
themselves
look
*NL*
after
the
horses
.
It
may
be
necessary
for
us
to
join
forces
;
if
so
they
*NL*
can
mount
our
whole
party
.
One
of
the
saddles
has
a
movable
horn
,
and
*NL*
can
be
easily
adapted
for
Mina
,
if
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
wild
adventure
we
are
on
.
Here
,
as
we
are
rushing
along
through
*NL*
the
darkness
,
with
the
cold
from
the
river
seeming
to
rise
up
and
strike
*NL*
us
;
with
all
the
mysterious
voices
of
the
night
around
us
,
it
all
comes
*NL*
home
.
We
seem
to
be
drifting
into
unknown
places
and
unknown
ways
;
into
*NL*
a
whole
world
of
dark
and
dreadful
things
.

Still
hurrying
along

The
day
has
come
,
and
Godalming
is
*NL*
sleeping
.
I
am
on
watch
.
The
morning
is
bitterly
cold
;
the
furnace
heat
*NL*
is
grateful
,
though
we
have
heavy
fur
coats
.
As
yet
we
have
passed
only
*NL*
a
few
open
boats
,
but
none
of
them
had
on
board
any
box
or
package
of
*NL*
anything
like
the
size
of
the
one
we
seek
.
The
men
were
scared
every
*NL*
time
we
turned
our
electric
lamp
on
them
,
and
fell
on
their
knees
and
*NL*
prayed

_
--
No
news
all
day
;
we
have
found
nothing
of
the
*NL*
kind
we
seek
.
We
have
now
passed
into
the
Bistritza
;
and
if
we
are
wrong
*NL*
in
our
surmise
our
chance
is
gone
.
We
have
over-hauled
every
boat
,
big
*NL*
and
little
.
Early
this
morning
,
one
crew
took
us
for
a
Government
boat
,
*NL*
and
treated
us
accordingly
.
We
saw
in
this
a
way
of
smoothing
matters
,
*NL*
so
at
Fundu
,
where
the
Bistritza
runs
into
the
Sereth
,
we
got
a
*NL*
Roumanian
flag
which
we
now
fly
conspicuously
.
With
every
boat
which
we
*NL*
have
over-hauled
since
then
this
trick
has
succeeded
;
we
have
had
every
*NL*
deference
shown
to
us
,
and
not
once
any
objection
to
whatever
we
chose
*NL*
to
ask
or
do
.
Some
of
the
Slovaks
tell
us
that
a
big
boat
passed
them
,
*NL*
going
at
more
than
usual
speed
as
she
had
a
double
crew
on
board
.
This
*NL*
was
before
they
came
to
Fundu
,
so
they
could
not
tell
us
whether
the
*NL*
boat
turned
into
the
Bistritza
or
continued
on
up
the
Sereth
.
At
Fundu
*NL*
we
could
not
hear
of
any
such
boat
,
so
she
must
have
passed
there
in
the
*NL*
night
.
I
am
feeling
very
sleepy
;
the
cold
is
perhaps
beginning
to
tell
*NL*
upon
me
,
and
nature
must
have
rest
some
time
.
Godalming
insists
that
he
*NL*
shall
keep
the
first
watch
.
God
bless
him
for
all
his
goodness
to
poor
*NL*
dear
Mina
and
me
.

November
,
morning
.
_
--
It
is
broad
daylight
.
That
good
fellow
would
not
*NL*
wake
me
.
He
says
it
would
have
been
a
sin
to
,
for
I
slept
peacefully
and
*NL*
was
forgetting
my
trouble
.
It
seems
brutally
selfish
to
me
to
have
slept
*NL*
so
long
,
and
let
him
watch
all
night
;
but
he
was
quite
right
.
I
am
a
new
*NL*
man
this
morning
;
and
,
as
I
sit
here
and
watch
him
sleeping
,
I
can
do
*NL*
all
that
is
necessary
both
as
to
minding
the
engine
,
steering
,
and
*NL*
keeping
watch
.
I
can
feel
that
my
strength
and
energy
are
coming
back
to
*NL*
me
.
I
wonder
where
Mina
is
now
,
and
Van
Helsing
.
They
should
have
got
to
*NL*
Veresti
about
noon
on
Wednesday
.
It
would
take
them
some
time
to
get
the
*NL*
carriage
and
horses
;
so
if
they
had
started
and
travelled
hard
,
they
*NL*
would
be
about
now
at
the
Borgo
Pass
.
God
guide
and
help
them
!
I
am
*NL*
afraid
to
think
what
may
happen
.
If
we
could
only
go
faster
!
but
we
*NL*
can
not
;
the
engines
are
throbbing
and
doing
their
utmost
.
I
wonder
how
*NL*
Dr.
Seward
and
Mr.
Morris
are
getting
on
.
There
seem
to
be
endless
*NL*
streams
running
down
the
mountains
into
this
river
,
but
as
none
of
them
*NL*
are
very
large
--
at
present
,
at
all
events
,
though
they
are
terrible
*NL*
doubtless
in
winter
and
when
the
snow
melts
--
the
horsemen
may
not
have
*NL*
met
much
obstruction
.
I
hope
that
before
we
get
to
Strasba
we
may
see
*NL*
them
;
for
if
by
that
time
we
have
not
overtaken
the
Count
,
it
may
be
*NL*
necessary
to
take
counsel
together
what
to
do
next
.

There
are
signs
of
snow
coming

if
it
falls

To-day
we
heard
of
the
launch
having
been
detained
by
an
*NL*
accident
when
trying
to
force
a
way
up
the
rapids
.
The
Slovak
boats
get
*NL*
up
all
right
,
by
aid
of
a
rope
and
steering
with
knowledge
.
Some
went
up
*NL*
only
a
few
hours
before
.
Godalming
is
an
amateur
fitter
himself
,
and
*NL*
evidently
it
was
he
who
put
the
launch
in
trim
again
.
Finally
,
they
got
*NL*
up
the
rapids
all
right
,
with
local
help
,
and
are
off
on
the
chase
*NL*
afresh
.
I
fear
that
the
boat
is
not
any
better
for
the
accident
;
the
*NL*
peasantry
tell
us
that
after
she
got
upon
smooth
water
again
,
she
kept
*NL*
stopping
every
now
and
again
so
long
as
she
was
in
sight
.
We
must
push
*NL*
on
harder
than
ever
;
our
help
may
be
wanted
soon
.

Arrived
at

at
noon

The
Professor
tells
me
that
*NL*
this
morning
at
dawn
he
could
hardly
hypnotise
me
at
all
,
and
that
all
I
*NL*
could

:

He
is
off
now
buying
a

He
says
that
he
will
later
on
try
to
buy
additional

,
so
*NL*
that
we
may
be
able
to
change
them

To
stop

got
the
carriage
and

horses
;
we
are
to
have
some
dinner
,
and
to
start
in
an
hour
.
The
*NL*
landlady
is
putting
us
up
a
huge
basket
of
provisions
;
it
seems
enough
*NL*
for
a
company

The

,
and
whispers
to

me
that
it
may
be

week
before
we
can
get
any
good
food
again

He
has

has
sent
home
such
a

lot
of
fur
coats

I

Him

MINA
HARKER
'S
JOURNAL

_
1
November
.
_
--
All
day
long
we
have
travelled
,
and
at
a
good
speed
.
The
*NL*
horses
seem
to
know
that
they
are
being
kindly
treated
,
for
they
go
*NL*
willingly
their
full
stage
at
best
speed
.
We
have
now
had
so
many
*NL*
changes
and
find
the
same
thing
so
constantly
that
we
are
encouraged
to
*NL*
think
that
the
journey
will
be
an
easy
one
.
Dr.
Van
Helsing
is
laconic
;
*NL*
he
tells
the
farmers
that
he
is
hurrying
to
Bistritz
,
and
pays
them
well
*NL*
to
make
the
exchange
of
horses
.
We
get
hot
soup
,
or
coffee
,
or
tea
;
and
*NL*
off
we
go
.
It
is
a
lovely
country
;
full
of
beauties
of
all
imaginable
*NL*
kinds
,
and
the
people
are
brave
,
and
strong
,
and
simple
,
and
seem
full
*NL*
of
nice
qualities
.
They
are
_
very
,
very
_
superstitious
.
In
the
first
*NL*
house
where
we
stopped
,
when
the
woman
who
served
us
saw
the
scar
on
my
*NL*
forehead
,
she
crossed
herself
and
put
out
two
fingers
towards
me
,
to
*NL*
keep
off
the
evil
eye
.
I
believe
they
went
to
the
trouble
of
putting
an
*NL*
extra
amount
of
garlic
into
our
food
;
and
I
ca
n't
abide
garlic
.
Ever
*NL*
since
then
I
have
taken
care
not
to
take
off
my
hat
or
veil
,
and
so
have
*NL*
escaped
their
suspicions
.
We
are
travelling
fast
,
and
as
we
have
no
*NL*
driver
with
us
to
carry
tales
,
we
go
ahead
of
scandal
;
but
I
daresay
*NL*
that
fear
of
the
evil
eye
will
follow
hard
behind
us
all
the
way
.
The
*NL*
Professor
seems
tireless
;
all
day
he
would
not
take
any
rest
,
though
he
*NL*
made
me
sleep
for
a
long
spell
.
At
sunset
time
he
hypnotised
me
,
and
he
*NL*
says
that
I
answered
as
usual
``
darkness
,
lapping
water
and
creaking
*NL*
wood
''
;
so
our
enemy
is
still
on
the
river
.
I
am
afraid
to
think
of
*NL*
Jonathan
,
but
somehow
I
have
now
no
fear
for
him
,
or
for
myself
.
I
write
*NL*
this
whilst
we
wait
in
a
farmhouse
for
the
horses
to
be
got
ready
.
Dr.
*NL*
Van
Helsing
is
sleeping
,
Poor
dear
,
he
looks
very
tired
and
old
and
*NL*
grey
,
but
his
mouth
is
set
as
firmly
as
a
conqueror
's
;
even
in
his
sleep
*NL*
he
is
instinct
with
resolution
.
When
we
have
well
started
I
must
make
*NL*
him
rest
whilst
I
drive
.
I
shall
tell
him
that
we
have
days
before
us
,
*NL*
and
we
must
not
break
down
when
most
of
all
his
strength
will
be
*NL*
needed
...
All
is
ready
;
we
are
off
shortly
.

November

morning

--
I
was
successful
,
and
we
took
turns
driving
all
*NL*
night
;
now
the
day
is
on
us
,
bright
though
cold
.
There
is
a
strange
*NL*
heaviness
in
the
air
--
I
say
heaviness
for
want
of
a
better
word
;
I
mean
*NL*
that
it
oppresses
us
both
.
It
is
very
cold
,
and
only
our
warm
furs
keep
*NL*
us
comfortable
.
At
dawn
Van
Helsing
hypnotised
me
;
he
says
I
answered
*NL*
``
darkness
,
creaking
wood
and
roaring
water
,
''
so
the
river
is
changing
as
*NL*
they
ascend
.
I
do
hope
that
my
darling
will
not
run
any
chance
of
*NL*
danger
--
more
than
need
be
;
but
we
are
in
God
's
hands
.

_
2
November
,
night
.
_
--
All
day
long
driving
.
The
country
gets
wilder
as
*NL*
we
go
,
and
the
great
spurs
of
the
Carpathians
,
which
at
Veresti
seemed
*NL*
so
far
from
us
and
so
low
on
the
horizon
,
now
seem
to
gather
round
us
*NL*
and
tower
in
front
.
We
both
seem
in
good
spirits
;
I
think
we
make
an
*NL*
effort
each
to
cheer
the
other
;
in
the
doing
so
we
cheer
ourselves
.
Dr.
*NL*
Van
Helsing
says
that
by
morning
we
shall
reach
the
Borgo
Pass
.
The
*NL*
houses
are
very
few
here
now
,
and
the
Professor
says
that
the
last
horse
*NL*
we
got
will
have
to
go
on
with
us
,
as
we
may
not
be
able
to
change
.
He
*NL*
got
two
in
addition
to
the
two
we
changed
,
so
that
now
we
have
a
rude
*NL*
four-in-hand
.
The
dear
horses
are
patient
and
good
,
and
they
give
us
no
*NL*
trouble
.
We
are
not
worried
with
other
travellers
,
and
so
even
I
can
*NL*
drive
.
We
shall
get
to
the
Pass
in
daylight
;
we
do
not
want
to
arrive
*NL*
before
.
So
we
take
it
easy
,
and
have
each
a
long
rest
in
turn
.
Oh
,
what
*NL*
will
to-morrow
bring
to
us
?
We
go
to
seek
the
place
where
my
poor
*NL*
darling
suffered
so
much
.
God
grant
that
we
may
be
guided
aright
,
and
*NL*
that
He
will
deign
to
watch
over
my
husband
and
those
dear
to
us
both
,
*NL*
and
who
are
in
such
deadly
peril
.
As
for
me
,
I
am
not
worthy
in
His
*NL*
sight
.
Alas
!
I
am
unclean
to
His
eyes
,
and
shall
be
until
He
may
deign
*NL*
to
let
me
stand
forth
in
His
sight
as
one
of
those
who
have
not
incurred
*NL*
His
wrath
.

Memorandum

November

_
--
This
to
my
old
and
true
friend
John
Seward
,
M.D.
,
of
*NL*
Purfleet
,
London
,
in
case
I
may
not
see
him
.
It
may
explain
.
It
is
*NL*
morning
,
and
I
write
by
a
fire
which
all
the
night
I
have
kept
*NL*
alive
--
Madam
Mina
aiding
me
.
It
is
cold
,
cold
;
so
cold
that
the
grey
*NL*
heavy
sky
is
full
of
snow
,
which
when
it
falls
will
settle
for
all
*NL*
winter
as
the
ground
is
hardening
to
receive
it
.
It
seems
to
have
*NL*
affected
Madam
Mina
;
she
has
been
so
heavy
of
head
all
day
that
she
was
*NL*
not
like
herself
.
She
sleeps
,
and
sleeps
,
and
sleeps
!
She
who
is
usual
*NL*
so
alert
,
have
done
literally
nothing
all
the
day
;
she
even
have
lost
*NL*
her
appetite
.
She
make
no
entry
into
her
little
diary
,
she
who
write
so
*NL*
faithful
at
every
pause
.
Something
whisper
to
me
that
all
is
not
well
.
*NL*
However
,
to-night
she
is
more
_
vif
_
.
Her
long
sleep
all
day
have
refresh
*NL*
and
restore
her
,
for
now
she
is
all
sweet
and
bright
as
ever
.
At
sunset
*NL*
I
try
to
hypnotise
her
,
but
alas
!
with
no
effect
;
the
power
has
grown
*NL*
less
and
less
with
each
day
,
and
to-night
it
fail
me
altogether
.
Well
,
*NL*
God
's
will
be
done
--
whatever
it
may
be
,
and
whithersoever
it
may
lead
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
to
the
historical
,
for
as
Madam
Mina
write
not
in
her
stenography
,
I
*NL*
must
,
in
my
cumbrous
old
fashion
,
that
so
each
day
of
us
may
not
go
*NL*
unrecorded
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
to
the
Borgo
Pass
just
after
sunrise
yesterday
morning
.
When
I
*NL*
saw
the
signs
of
the
dawn
I
got
ready
for
the
hypnotism
.
We
stopped
our
*NL*
carriage
,
and
got
down
so
that
there
might
be
no
disturbance
.
I
made
a
*NL*
couch
with
furs
,
and
Madam
Mina
,
lying
down
,
yield
herself
as
usual
,
but
*NL*
more
slow
and
more
short
time
than
ever
,
to
the
hypnotic
sleep
.
As
*NL*
before
,
came
the
answer
:
``
darkness
and
the
swirling
of
water
.
''
Then
she
*NL*
woke
,
bright
and
radiant
and
we
go
on
our
way
and
soon
reach
the
Pass
.
*NL*
At
this
time
and
place
,
she
become
all
on
fire
with
zeal
;
some
new
*NL*
guiding
power
be
in
her
manifested
,
for
she
point
to
a
road
and
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
know
you
it
?
''
I
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
know
it
,
''
she
answer
,
and
with
a
pause
,
add
:
``
Have
not
my
*NL*
Jonathan
travelled
it
and
wrote
of
his
travel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
I
think
somewhat
strange
,
but
soon
I
see
that
there
be
only
one
*NL*
such
by-road
.
It
is
used
but
little
,
and
very
different
from
the
coach
*NL*
road
from
the
Bukovina
to
Bistritz
,
which
is
more
wide
and
hard
,
and
*NL*
more
of
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
came
down
this
road
;
when
we
meet
other
ways
--
not
always
were
we
*NL*
sure
that
they
were
roads
at
all
,
for
they
be
neglect
and
light
snow
*NL*
have
fallen
--
the
horses
know
and
they
only
.
I
give
rein
to
them
,
and
*NL*
they
go
on
so
patient
.
By-and-by
we
find
all
the
things
which
Jonathan
*NL*
have
note
in
that
wonderful
diary
of
him
.
Then
we
go
on
for
long
,
long
*NL*
hours
and
hours
.
At
the
first
,
I
tell
Madam
Mina
to
sleep
;
she
try
,
and
*NL*
she
succeed
.
She
sleep
all
the
time
;
till
at
the
last
,
I
feel
myself
to
*NL*
suspicious
grow
,
and
attempt
to
wake
her
.
But
she
sleep
on
,
and
I
may
*NL*
not
wake
her
though
I
try
.
I
do
not
wish
to
try
too
hard
lest
I
harm
*NL*
her
;
for
I
know
that
she
have
suffer
much
,
and
sleep
at
times
be
*NL*
all-in-all
to
her
.
I
think
I
drowse
myself
,
for
all
of
sudden
I
feel
*NL*
guilt
,
as
though
I
have
done
something
;
I
find
myself
bolt
up
,
with
the
*NL*
reins
in
my
hand
,
and
the
good
horses
go
along
jog
,
jog
,
just
as
ever
.
I
*NL*
look
down
and
find
Madam
Mina
still
sleep
.
It
is
now
not
far
off
sunset
*NL*
time
,
and
over
the
snow
the
light
of
the
sun
flow
in
big
yellow
flood
,
*NL*
so
that
we
throw
great
long
shadow
on
where
the
mountain
rise
so
steep
.
*NL*
For
we
are
going
up
,
and
up
;
and
all
is
oh
!
so
wild
and
rocky
,
as
though
*NL*
it
were
the
end
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
arouse
Madam
Mina
.
This
time
she
wake
with
not
much
trouble
,
and
*NL*
then
I
try
to
put
her
to
hypnotic
sleep
.
But
she
sleep
not
,
being
as
*NL*
though
I
were
not
.
Still
I
try
and
try
,
till
all
at
once
I
find
her
and
*NL*
myself
in
dark
;
so
I
look
round
,
and
find
that
the
sun
have
gone
down
.
*NL*
Madam
Mina
laugh
,
and
I
turn
and
look
at
her
.
She
is
now
quite
awake
,
*NL*
and
look
so
well
as
I
never
saw
her
since
that
night
at
Carfax
when
we
*NL*
first
enter
the
Count
's
house
.
I
am
amaze
,
and
not
at
ease
then
;
but
she
*NL*
is
so
bright
and
tender
and
thoughtful
for
me
that
I
forget
all
fear
.
I
*NL*
light
a
fire
,
for
we
have
brought
supply
of
wood
with
us
,
and
she
*NL*
prepare
food
while
I
undo
the
horses
and
set
them
,
tethered
in
shelter
,
*NL*
to
feed
.
Then
when
I
return
to
the
fire
she
have
my
supper
ready
.
I
go
*NL*
to
help
her
;
but
she
smile
,
and
tell
me
that
she
have
eat
already
--
that
*NL*
she
was
so
hungry
that
she
would
not
wait
.
I
like
it
not
,
and
I
have
*NL*
grave
doubts
;
but
I
fear
to
affright
her
,
and
so
I
am
silent
of
it
.
She
*NL*
help
me
and
I
eat
alone
;
and
then
we
wrap
in
fur
and
lie
beside
the
*NL*
fire
,
and
I
tell
her
to
sleep
while
I
watch
.
But
presently
I
forget
all
*NL*
of
watching
;
and
when
I
sudden
remember
that
I
watch
,
I
find
her
lying
*NL*
quiet
,
but
awake
,
and
looking
at
me
with
so
bright
eyes
.
Once
,
twice
*NL*
more
the
same
occur
,
and
I
get
much
sleep
till
before
morning
.
When
I
*NL*
wake
I
try
to
hypnotise
her
;
but
alas
!
though
she
shut
her
eyes
*NL*
obedient
,
she
may
not
sleep
.
The
sun
rise
up
,
and
up
,
and
up
;
and
then
*NL*
sleep
come
to
her
too
late
,
but
so
heavy
that
she
will
not
wake
.
I
have
*NL*
to
lift
her
up
,
and
place
her
sleeping
in
the
carriage
when
I
have
*NL*
harnessed
the
horses
and
made
all
ready
.
Madam
still
sleep
,
and
she
look
*NL*
in
her
sleep
more
healthy
and
more
redder
than
before
.
And
I
like
it
*NL*
not
.
And
I
am
afraid
,
afraid
,
afraid
!
--
I
am
afraid
of
all
things
--
even
*NL*
to
think
but
I
must
go
on
my
way
.
The
stake
we
play
for
is
life
and
*NL*
death
,
or
more
than
these
,
and
we
must
not
flinch
.

_
5
November
,
morning
.
_
--
Let
me
be
accurate
in
everything
,
for
though
you
*NL*
and
I
have
seen
some
strange
things
together
,
you
may
at
the
first
think
*NL*
that
I
,
Van
Helsing
,
am
mad
--
that
the
many
horrors
and
the
so
long
*NL*
strain
on
nerves
has
at
the
last
turn
my
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
yesterday
we
travel
,
ever
getting
closer
to
the
mountains
,
and
*NL*
moving
into
a
more
and
more
wild
and
desert
land
.
There
are
great
,
*NL*
frowning
precipices
and
much
falling
water
,
and
Nature
seem
to
have
held
*NL*
sometime
her
carnival
.
Madam
Mina
still
sleep
and
sleep
;
and
though
I
*NL*
did
have
hunger
and
appeased
it
,
I
could
not
waken
her
--
even
for
food
.
I
*NL*
began
to
fear
that
the
fatal
spell
of
the
place
was
upon
her
,
tainted
as
*NL*
she
is
with
that
Vampire
baptism
.
``
Well
,
''
said
I
to
myself
,
``
if
it
be
*NL*
that
she
sleep
all
the
day
,
it
shall
also
be
that
I
do
not
sleep
at
*NL*
night
.
''
As
we
travel
on
the
rough
road
,
for
a
road
of
an
ancient
and
*NL*
imperfect
kind
there
was
,
I
held
down
my
head
and
slept
.
Again
I
waked
*NL*
with
a
sense
of
guilt
and
of
time
passed
,
and
found
Madam
Mina
still
*NL*
sleeping
,
and
the
sun
low
down
.
But
all
was
indeed
changed
;
the
frowning
*NL*
mountains
seemed
further
away
,
and
we
were
near
the
top
of
a
*NL*
steep-rising
hill
,
on
summit
of
which
was
such
a
castle
as
Jonathan
tell
*NL*
of
in
his
diary
.
At
once
I
exulted
and
feared
;
for
now
,
for
good
or
ill
,
*NL*
the
end
was
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
woke
Madam
Mina
,
and
again
tried
to
hypnotise
her
;
but
alas
!
*NL*
unavailing
till
too
late
.
Then
,
ere
the
great
dark
came
upon
us
--
for
*NL*
even
after
down-sun
the
heavens
reflected
the
gone
sun
on
the
snow
,
and
*NL*
all
was
for
a
time
in
a
great
twilight
--
I
took
out
the
horses
and
fed
*NL*
them
in
what
shelter
I
could
.
Then
I
make
a
fire
;
and
near
it
I
make
*NL*
Madam
Mina
,
now
awake
and
more
charming
than
ever
,
sit
comfortable
amid
*NL*
her
rugs
.
I
got
ready
food
:
but
she
would
not
eat
,
simply
saying
that
*NL*
she
had
not
hunger
.
I
did
not
press
her
,
knowing
her
unavailingness
.
But
*NL*
I
myself
eat
,
for
I
must
needs
now
be
strong
for
all
.
Then
,
with
the
*NL*
fear
on
me
of
what
might
be
,
I
drew
a
ring
so
big
for
her
comfort
,
round
*NL*
where
Madam
Mina
sat
;
and
over
the
ring
I
passed
some
of
the
wafer
,
and
*NL*
I
broke
it
fine
so
that
all
was
well
guarded
.
She
sat
still
all
the
*NL*
time
--
so
still
as
one
dead
;
and
she
grew
whiter
and
ever
whiter
till
the
*NL*
snow
was
not
more
pale
;
and
no
word
she
said
.
But
when
I
drew
near
,
she
*NL*
clung
to
me
,
and
I
could
know
that
the
poor
soul
shook
her
from
head
to
*NL*
feet
with
a
tremor
that
was
pain
to
feel
.
I
said
to
her
presently
,
when
*NL*
she
had
grown
more
quiet
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
not
come
over
to
the
fire
?
''
for
I
wished
to
make
a
test
of
*NL*
what
she
could
.
She
rose
obedient
,
but
when
she
have
made
a
step
she
*NL*
stopped
,
and
stood
as
one
stricken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
go
on
?
''
I
asked
.
She
shook
her
head
,
and
,
coming
back
,
sat
*NL*
down
in
her
place
.
Then
,
looking
at
me
with
open
eyes
,
as
of
one
waked
*NL*
from
sleep
,
she
said
simply
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
!
''
and
remained
silent
.
I
rejoiced
,
for
I
knew
that
what
she
*NL*
could
not
,
none
of
those
that
we
dreaded
could
.
Though
there
might
be
*NL*
danger
to
her
body
,
yet
her
soul
was
safe
!
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
horses
began
to
scream
,
and
tore
at
their
tethers
till
I
*NL*
came
to
them
and
quieted
them
.
When
they
did
feel
my
hands
on
them
,
they
*NL*
whinnied
low
as
in
joy
,
and
licked
at
my
hands
and
were
quiet
for
a
*NL*
time
.
Many
times
through
the
night
did
I
come
to
them
,
till
it
arrive
to
*NL*
the
cold
hour
when
all
nature
is
at
lowest
;
and
every
time
my
coming
was
*NL*
with
quiet
of
them
.
In
the
cold
hour
the
fire
began
to
die
,
and
I
was
*NL*
about
stepping
forth
to
replenish
it
,
for
now
the
snow
came
in
flying
*NL*
sweeps
and
with
it
a
chill
mist
.
Even
in
the
dark
there
was
a
light
of
*NL*
some
kind
,
as
there
ever
is
over
snow
;
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
*NL*
snow-flurries
and
the
wreaths
of
mist
took
shape
as
of
women
with
*NL*
trailing
garments
.
All
was
in
dead
,
grim
silence
only
that
the
horses
*NL*
whinnied
and
cowered
,
as
if
in
terror
of
the
worst
.
I
began
to
*NL*
fear
--
horrible
fears
;
but
then
came
to
me
the
sense
of
safety
in
that
*NL*
ring
wherein
I
stood
.
I
began
,
too
,
to
think
that
my
imaginings
were
of
*NL*
the
night
,
and
the
gloom
,
and
the
unrest
that
I
have
gone
through
,
and
*NL*
all
the
terrible
anxiety
.
It
was
as
though
my
memories
of
all
Jonathan
's
*NL*
horrid
experience
were
befooling
me
;
for
the
snow
flakes
and
the
mist
*NL*
began
to
wheel
and
circle
round
,
till
I
could
get
as
though
a
shadowy
*NL*
glimpse
of
those
women
that
would
have
kissed
him
.
And
then
the
horses
*NL*
cowered
lower
and
lower
,
and
moaned
in
terror
as
men
do
in
pain
.
Even
*NL*
the
madness
of
fright
was
not
to
them
,
so
that
they
could
break
away
.
I
*NL*
feared
for
my
dear
Madam
Mina
when
these
weird
figures
drew
near
and
*NL*
circled
round
.
I
looked
at
her
,
but
she
sat
calm
,
and
smiled
at
me
;
when
*NL*
I
would
have
stepped
to
the
fire
to
replenish
it
,
she
caught
me
and
held
*NL*
me
back
,
and
whispered
,
like
a
voice
that
one
hears
in
a
dream
,
so
low
*NL*
it
was
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
No
!
Do
not
go
without
.
Here
you
are
safe
!
''
I
turned
to
her
,
and
*NL*
looking
in
her
eyes
,
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
?
It
is
for
you
that
I
fear
!
''
whereat
she
laughed
--
a
laugh
,
low
*NL*
and
unreal
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fear
for
_
me
_
!
Why
fear
for
me
?
None
safer
in
all
the
world
from
them
*NL*
than
I
am
,
''
and
as
I
wondered
at
the
meaning
of
her
words
,
a
puff
of
*NL*
wind
made
the
flame
leap
up
,
and
I
see
the
red
scar
on
her
forehead
.
*NL*
Then
,
alas
!
I
knew
.
Did
I
not
,
I
would
soon
have
learned
,
for
the
*NL*
wheeling
figures
of
mist
and
snow
came
closer
,
but
keeping
ever
without
*NL*
the
Holy
circle
.
Then
they
began
to
materialise
till
--
if
God
have
not
*NL*
take
away
my
reason
,
for
I
saw
it
through
my
eyes
--
there
were
before
me
*NL*
in
actual
flesh
the
same
three
women
that
Jonathan
saw
in
the
room
,
when
*NL*
they
would
have
kissed
his
throat
.
I
knew
the
swaying
round
forms
,
the
*NL*
bright
hard
eyes
,
the
white
teeth
,
the
ruddy
colour
,
the
voluptuous
*NL*
lips
.
They
smiled
ever
at
poor
dear
Madam
Mina
;
and
as
their
laugh
came
*NL*
through
the
silence
of
the
night
,
they
twined
their
arms
and
pointed
to
*NL*
her
,
and
said
in
those
so
sweet
tingling
tones
that
Jonathan
said
were
*NL*
of
the
intolerable
sweetness
of
the
water-glasses
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
sister
.
Come
to
us
.
Come
!
Come
!
''
In
fear
I
turned
to
my
poor
*NL*
Madam
Mina
,
and
my
heart
with
gladness
leapt
like
flame
;
for
oh
!
the
*NL*
terror
in
her
sweet
eyes
,
the
repulsion
,
the
horror
,
told
a
story
to
my
*NL*
heart
that
was
all
of
hope
.
God
be
thanked
she
was
not
,
yet
,
of
them
.
I
*NL*
seized
some
of
the
firewood
which
was
by
me
,
and
holding
out
some
of
the
*NL*
Wafer
,
advanced
on
them
towards
the
fire
.
They
drew
back
before
me
,
and
*NL*
laughed
their
low
horrid
laugh
.
I
fed
the
fire
,
and
feared
them
not
;
for
*NL*
I
knew
that
we
were
safe
within
our
protections
.
They
could
not
*NL*
approach
,
me
,
whilst
so
armed
,
nor
Madam
Mina
whilst
she
remained
within
*NL*
the
ring
,
which
she
could
not
leave
no
more
than
they
could
enter
.
The
*NL*
horses
had
ceased
to
moan
,
and
lay
still
on
the
ground
;
the
snow
fell
on
*NL*
them
softly
,
and
they
grew
whiter
.
I
knew
that
there
was
for
the
poor
*NL*
beasts
no
more
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
we
remained
till
the
red
of
the
dawn
to
fall
through
the
*NL*
snow-gloom
.
I
was
desolate
and
afraid
,
and
full
of
woe
and
terror
;
but
*NL*
when
that
beautiful
sun
began
to
climb
the
horizon
life
was
to
me
again
.
*NL*
At
the
first
coming
of
the
dawn
the
horrid
figures
melted
in
the
*NL*
whirling
mist
and
snow
;
the
wreaths
of
transparent
gloom
moved
away
*NL*
towards
the
castle
,
and
were
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instinctively
,
with
the
dawn
coming
,
I
turned
to
Madam
Mina
,
intending
*NL*
to
hypnotise
her
;
but
she
lay
in
a
deep
and
sudden
sleep
,
from
which
I
*NL*
could
not
wake
her
.
I
tried
to
hypnotise
through
her
sleep
,
but
she
made
*NL*
no
response
,
none
at
all
;
and
the
day
broke
.
I
fear
yet
to
stir
.
I
have
*NL*
made
my
fire
and
have
seen
the
horses
,
they
are
all
dead
.
To-day
I
have
*NL*
much
to
do
here
,
and
I
keep
waiting
till
the
sun
is
up
high
;
for
there
*NL*
may
be
places
where
I
must
go
,
where
that
sunlight
,
though
snow
and
mist
*NL*
obscure
it
,
will
be
to
me
a
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
strengthen
me
with
breakfast
,
and
then
I
will
to
my
terrible
*NL*
work
.
Madam
Mina
still
sleeps
;
and
,
God
be
thanked
!
she
is
calm
in
her
*NL*
sleep

The
accident
to
the
launch
has
been
a
terrible
*NL*
thing
for
us
.
Only
for
it
we
should
have
overtaken
the
boat
long
ago
;
*NL*
and
by
now
my
dear
Mina
would
have
been
free
.
I
fear
to
think
of
her
,
*NL*
off
on
the
wolds
near
that
horrid
place
.
We
have
got
horses
,
and
we
*NL*
follow
on
the
track
.
I
note
this
whilst
Godalming
is
getting
ready
.
We
*NL*
have
our
arms
.
The
Szgany
must
look
out
if
they
mean
fight
.
Oh
,
if
only
*NL*
Morris
and
Seward
were
with
us
.
We
must
only
hope
!
If
I
write
no
more
*NL*
Good-bye
,
Mina
!
God
bless
and
keep
you

--
With
the
dawn
we
saw
the
body
of
Szgany
before
us
dashing
*NL*
away
from
the
river
with
their
leiter-wagon
.
They
surrounded
it
in
a
*NL*
cluster
,
and
hurried
along
as
though
beset
.
The
snow
is
falling
lightly
*NL*
and
there
is
a
strange
excitement
in
the
air
.
It
may
be
our
own
*NL*
feelings
,
but
the
depression
is
strange
.
Far
off
I
hear
the
howling
of
*NL*
wolves
;
the
snow
brings
them
down
from
the
mountains
,
and
there
are
*NL*
dangers
to
all
of
us
,
and
from
all
sides
.
The
horses
are
nearly
ready
,
*NL*
and
we
are
soon
off
.
We
ride
to
death
of
some
one
.

alone
knows
who
,
*NL*
or
where
,
or
what

or

,
or
how
it
may

Van

's
Memorandum

*NL*
*NL*
_
5
November
,
afternoon
.
_
--
I
am
at
least
sane
.
Thank
God
for
that
mercy
*NL*
at
all
events
,
though
the
proving
it
has
been
dreadful
.
When
I
left
*NL*
Madam
Mina
sleeping
within
the
Holy
circle
,
I
took
my
way
to
the
castle
.
*NL*
The
blacksmith
hammer
which
I
took
in
the
carriage
from
Veresti
was
*NL*
useful
;
though
the
doors
were
all
open
I
broke
them
off
the
rusty
*NL*
hinges
,
lest
some
ill-intent
or
ill-chance
should
close
them
,
so
that
*NL*
being
entered
I
might
not
get
out
.
Jonathan
's
bitter
experience
served
*NL*
me
here
.
By
memory
of
his
diary
I
found
my
way
to
the
old
chapel
,
for
I
*NL*
knew
that
here
my
work
lay
.
The
air
was
oppressive
;
it
seemed
as
if
*NL*
there
was
some
sulphurous
fume
,
which
at
times
made
me
dizzy
.
Either
*NL*
there
was
a
roaring
in
my
ears
or
I
heard
afar
off
the
howl
of
wolves
.
*NL*
Then
I
bethought
me
of
my
dear
Madam
Mina
,
and
I
was
in
terrible
plight
.
*NL*
The
dilemma
had
me
between
his
horns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
,
I
had
not
dare
to
take
into
this
place
,
but
left
safe
from
the
*NL*
Vampire
in
that
Holy
circle
;
and
yet
even
there
would
be
the
wolf
!
I
*NL*
resolve
me
that
my
work
lay
here
,
and
that
as
to
the
wolves
we
must
*NL*
submit
,
if
it
were
God
's
will
.
At
any
rate
it
was
only
death
and
*NL*
freedom
beyond
.
So
did
I
choose
for
her
.
Had
it
but
been
for
myself
the
*NL*
choice
had
been
easy
,
the
maw
of
the
wolf
were
better
to
rest
in
than
*NL*
the
grave
of
the
Vampire
!
So
I
make
my
choice
to
go
on
with
my
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
that
there
were
at
least
three
graves
to
find
--
graves
that
are
*NL*
inhabit
;
so
I
search
,
and
search
,
and
I
find
one
of
them
.
She
lay
in
her
*NL*
Vampire
sleep
,
so
full
of
life
and
voluptuous
beauty
that
I
shudder
as
*NL*
though
I
have
come
to
do
murder
.
Ah
,
I
doubt
not
that
in
old
time
,
when
*NL*
such
things
were
,
many
a
man
who
set
forth
to
do
such
a
task
as
mine
,
*NL*
found
at
the
last
his
heart
fail
him
,
and
then
his
nerve
.
So
he
delay
,
*NL*
and
delay
,
and
delay
,
till
the
mere
beauty
and
the
fascination
of
the
*NL*
wanton
Un-Dead
have
hypnotise
him
;
and
he
remain
on
and
on
,
till
sunset
*NL*
come
,
and
the
Vampire
sleep
be
over
.
Then
the
beautiful
eyes
of
the
fair
*NL*
woman
open
and
look
love
,
and
the
voluptuous
mouth
present
to
a
*NL*
kiss
--
and
man
is
weak
.
And
there
remain
one
more
victim
in
the
Vampire
*NL*
fold
;
one
more
to
swell
the
grim
and
grisly
ranks
of
the
Un-Dead
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
some
fascination
,
surely
,
when
I
am
moved
by
the
mere
presence
*NL*
of
such
an
one
,
even
lying
as
she
lay
in
a
tomb
fretted
with
age
and
*NL*
heavy
with
the
dust
of
centuries
,
though
there
be
that
horrid
odour
such
*NL*
as
the
lairs
of
the
Count
have
had
.
Yes
,
I
was
moved
--
I
,
Van
Helsing
,
*NL*
with
all
my
purpose
and
with
my
motive
for
hate
--
I
was
moved
to
a
*NL*
yearning
for
delay
which
seemed
to
paralyse
my
faculties
and
to
clog
my
*NL*
very
soul
.
It
may
have
been
that
the
need
of
natural
sleep
,
and
the
*NL*
strange
oppression
of
the
air
were
beginning
to
overcome
me
.
Certain
it
*NL*
was
that
I
was
lapsing
into
sleep
,
the
open-eyed
sleep
of
one
who
yields
*NL*
to
a
sweet
fascination
,
when
there
came
through
the
snow-stilled
air
a
*NL*
long
,
low
wail
,
so
full
of
woe
and
pity
that
it
woke
me
like
the
sound
*NL*
of
a
clarion
.
For
it
was
the
voice
of
my
dear
Madam
Mina
that
I
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
braced
myself
again
to
my
horrid
task
,
and
found
by
wrenching
*NL*
away
tomb-tops
one
other
of
the
sisters
,
the
other
dark
one
.
I
dared
not
*NL*
pause
to
look
on
her
as
I
had
on
her
sister
,
lest
once
more
I
should
*NL*
begin
to
be
enthrall
;
but
I
go
on
searching
until
,
presently
,
I
find
in
*NL*
a
high
great
tomb
as
if
made
to
one
much
beloved
that
other
fair
sister
*NL*
which
,
like
Jonathan
I
had
seen
to
gather
herself
out
of
the
atoms
of
*NL*
the
mist
.
She
was
so
fair
to
look
on
,
so
radiantly
beautiful
,
so
*NL*
exquisitely
voluptuous
,
that
the
very
instinct
of
man
in
me
,
which
calls
*NL*
some
of
my
sex
to
love
and
to
protect
one
of
hers
,
made
my
head
whirl
*NL*
with
new
emotion
.
But
God
be
thanked
,
that
soul-wail
of
my
dear
Madam
*NL*
Mina
had
not
died
out
of
my
ears
;
and
,
before
the
spell
could
be
wrought
*NL*
further
upon
me
,
I
had
nerved
myself
to
my
wild
work
.
By
this
time
I
had
*NL*
searched
all
the
tombs
in
the
chapel
,
so
far
as
I
could
tell
;
and
as
*NL*
there
had
been
only
three
of
these
Un-Dead
phantoms
around
us
in
the
*NL*
night
,
I
took
it
that
there
were
no
more
of
active
Un-Dead
existent
.
*NL*
There
was
one
great
tomb
more
lordly
than
all
the
rest
;
huge
it
was
,
and
*NL*
nobly
proportioned
.
On
it
was
but
one
word
*NL*
*NL*
DRACULA
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
then
was
the
Un-Dead
home
of
the
King-Vampire
,
to
whom
so
many
more
*NL*
were
due
.
Its
emptiness
spoke
eloquent
to
make
certain
what
I
knew
.
*NL*
Before
I
began
to
restore
these
women
to
their
dead
selves
through
my
*NL*
awful
work
,
I
laid
in
Dracula
's
tomb
some
of
the
Wafer
,
and
so
banished
*NL*
him
from
it
,
Un-Dead
,
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
began
my
terrible
task
,
and
I
dreaded
it
.
Had
it
been
but
one
,
it
*NL*
had
been
easy
,
comparative
.
But
three
!
To
begin
twice
more
after
I
had
*NL*
been
through
a
deed
of
horror
;
for
if
it
was
terrible
with
the
sweet
*NL*
Miss
Lucy
,
what
would
it
not
be
with
these
strange
ones
who
had
survived
*NL*
through
centuries
,
and
who
had
been
strengthened
by
the
passing
of
the
*NL*
years
;
who
would
,
if
they
could
,
have
fought
for
their
foul
lives
...
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
my
friend
John
,
but
it
was
butcher
work
;
had
I
not
been
nerved
by
*NL*
thoughts
of
other
dead
,
and
of
the
living
over
whom
hung
such
a
pall
of
*NL*
fear
,
I
could
not
have
gone
on
.
I
tremble
and
tremble
even
yet
,
though
*NL*
till
all
was
over
,
God
be
thanked
,
my
nerve
did
stand
.
Had
I
not
seen
*NL*
the
repose
in
the
first
place
,
and
the
gladness
that
stole
over
it
just
*NL*
ere
the
final
dissolution
came
,
as
realisation
that
the
soul
had
been
*NL*
won
,
I
could
not
have
gone
further
with
my
butchery
.
I
could
not
have
*NL*
endured
the
horrid
screeching
as
the
stake
drove
home
;
the
plunging
of
*NL*
writhing
form
,
and
lips
of
bloody
foam
.
I
should
have
fled
in
terror
and
*NL*
left
my
work
undone
.
But
it
is
over
!
And
the
poor
souls
,
I
can
pity
them
*NL*
now
and
weep
,
as
I
think
of
them
placid
each
in
her
full
sleep
of
death
*NL*
for
a
short
moment
ere
fading
.
For
,
friend
John
,
hardly
had
my
knife
*NL*
severed
the
head
of
each
,
before
the
whole
body
began
to
melt
away
and
*NL*
crumble
in
to
its
native
dust
,
as
though
the
death
that
should
have
come
*NL*
centuries
agone
had
at
last
assert
himself
and
say
at
once
and
loud
``
I
*NL*
am
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
left
the
castle
I
so
fixed
its
entrances
that
never
more
can
*NL*
the
Count
enter
there
Un-Dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
stepped
into
the
circle
where
Madam
Mina
slept
,
she
woke
from
her
*NL*
sleep
,
and
,
seeing
,
me
,
cried
out
in
pain
that
I
had
endured
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
she
said
,
``
come
away
from
this
awful
place
!
Let
us
go
to
meet
my
*NL*
husband
who
is
,
I
know
,
coming
towards
us
.
''
She
was
looking
thin
and
*NL*
pale
and
weak
;
but
her
eyes
were
pure
and
glowed
with
fervour
.
I
was
*NL*
glad
to
see
her
paleness
and
her
illness
,
for
my
mind
was
full
of
the
*NL*
fresh
horror
of
that
ruddy
vampire
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
with
trust
and
hope
,
and
yet
full
of
fear
,
we
go
eastward
to
meet
*NL*
our
friends
--
and
_
him
_
--
whom
Madam
Mina
tell
me
that
she
_
know
_
are
*NL*
coming
to
meet
us
.

November

--
It
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
Professor
and
I
*NL*
took
our
way
towards
the
east
whence
I
knew
Jonathan
was
coming
.
We
did
*NL*
not
go
fast
,
though
the
way
was
steeply
downhill
,
for
we
had
to
take
*NL*
heavy
rugs
and
wraps
with
us
;
we
dared
not
face
the
possibility
of
being
*NL*
left
without
warmth
in
the
cold
and
the
snow
.
We
had
to
take
some
of
our
*NL*
provisions
,
too
,
for
we
were
in
a
perfect
desolation
,
and
,
so
far
as
we
*NL*
could
see
through
the
snowfall
,
there
was
not
even
the
sign
of
*NL*
habitation
.
When
we
had
gone
about
a
mile
,
I
was
tired
with
the
heavy
*NL*
walking
and
sat
down
to
rest
.
Then
we
looked
back
and
saw
where
the
*NL*
clear
line
of
Dracula
's
castle
cut
the
sky
;
for
we
were
so
deep
under
*NL*
the
hill
whereon
it
was
set
that
the
angle
of
perspective
of
the
*NL*
Carpathian
mountains
was
far
below
it
.
We
saw
it
in
all
its
grandeur
,
*NL*
perched
a
thousand
feet
on
the
summit
of
a
sheer
precipice
,
and
with
*NL*
seemingly
a
great
gap
between
it
and
the
steep
of
the
adjacent
mountain
*NL*
on
any
side
.
There
was
something
wild
and
uncanny
about
the
place
.
We
*NL*
could
hear
the
distant
howling
of
wolves
.
They
were
far
off
,
but
the
*NL*
sound
,
even
though
coming
muffled
through
the
deadening
snowfall
,
was
*NL*
full
of
terror
.
I
knew
from
the
way
Dr.
Van
Helsing
was
searching
about
*NL*
that
he
was
trying
to
seek
some
strategic
point
,
where
we
would
be
less
*NL*
exposed
in
case
of
attack
.
The
rough
roadway
still
led
downwards
;
we
*NL*
could
trace
it
through
the
drifted
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
little
while
the
Professor
signalled
to
me
,
so
I
got
up
and
joined
*NL*
him
.
He
had
found
a
wonderful
spot
,
a
sort
of
natural
hollow
in
a
rock
,
*NL*
with
an
entrance
like
a
doorway
between
two
boulders
.
He
took
me
by
the
*NL*
hand
and
drew
me
in
:
``
See
!
''
he
said
,
``
here
you
will
be
in
shelter
;
and
*NL*
if
the
wolves
do
come
I
can
meet
them
one
by
one
.
''
He
brought
in
our
*NL*
furs
,
and
made
a
snug
nest
for
me
,
and
got
out
some
provisions
and
*NL*
forced
them
upon
me
.
But
I
could
not
eat
;
to
even
try
to
do
so
was
*NL*
repulsive
to
me
,
and
,
much
as
I
would
have
liked
to
please
him
,
I
could
*NL*
not
bring
myself
to
the
attempt
.
He
looked
very
sad
,
but
did
not
*NL*
reproach
me
.
Taking
his
field-glasses
from
the
case
,
he
stood
on
the
top
*NL*
of
the
rock
,
and
began
to
search
the
horizon
.
Suddenly
he
called
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
Madam
Mina
,
look
!
look
!
''
I
sprang
up
and
stood
beside
him
on
the
*NL*
rock
;
he
handed
me
his
glasses
and
pointed
.
The
snow
was
now
falling
*NL*
more
heavily
,
and
swirled
about
fiercely
,
for
a
high
wind
was
beginning
*NL*
to
blow
.
However
,
there
were
times
when
there
were
pauses
between
the
*NL*
snow
flurries
and
I
could
see
a
long
way
round
.
From
the
height
where
we
*NL*
were
it
was
possible
to
see
a
great
distance
;
and
far
off
,
beyond
the
*NL*
white
waste
of
snow
,
I
could
see
the
river
lying
like
a
black
ribbon
in
*NL*
kinks
and
curls
as
it
wound
its
way
.
Straight
in
front
of
us
and
not
far
*NL*
off
--
in
fact
,
so
near
that
I
wondered
we
had
not
noticed
before
--
came
a
*NL*
group
of
mounted
men
hurrying
along
.
In
the
midst
of
them
was
a
cart
,
a
*NL*
long
leiter-wagon
which
swept
from
side
to
side
,
like
a
dog
's
tail
*NL*
wagging
,
with
each
stern
inequality
of
the
road
.
Outlined
against
the
*NL*
snow
as
they
were
,
I
could
see
from
the
men
's
clothes
that
they
were
*NL*
peasants
or
gypsies
of
some
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
cart
was
a
great
square
chest
.
My
heart
leaped
as
I
saw
it
,
for
I
*NL*
felt
that
the
end
was
coming
.
The
evening
was
now
drawing
close
,
and
*NL*
well
I
knew
that
at
sunset
the
Thing
,
which
was
till
then
imprisoned
*NL*
there
,
would
take
new
freedom
and
could
in
any
of
many
forms
elude
all
*NL*
pursuit
.
In
fear
I
turned
to
the
Professor
;
to
my
consternation
,
*NL*
however
,
he
was
not
there
.
An
instant
later
,
I
saw
him
below
me
.
Round
*NL*
the
rock
he
had
drawn
a
circle
,
such
as
we
had
found
shelter
in
last
*NL*
night
.
When
he
had
completed
it
he
stood
beside
me
again
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
you
shall
be
safe
here
from
_
him
_
!
''
He
took
the
glasses
from
*NL*
me
,
and
at
the
next
lull
of
the
snow
swept
the
whole
space
below
us
.
*NL*
``
See
,
''
he
said
,
``
they
come
quickly
;
they
are
flogging
the
horses
,
and
*NL*
galloping
as
hard
as
they
can
.
''
He
paused
and
went
on
in
a
hollow
*NL*
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
racing
for
the
sunset
.
We
may
be
too
late
.
God
's
will
be
*NL*
done
!
''
Down
came
another
blinding
rush
of
driving
snow
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
landscape
was
blotted
out
.
It
soon
passed
,
however
,
and
once
more
his
*NL*
glasses
were
fixed
on
the
plain
.
Then
came
a
sudden
cry
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
Look
!
Look
!
See
,
two
horsemen
follow
fast
,
coming
up
from
the
*NL*
south
.
It
must
be
Quincey
and
John
.
Take
the
glass
.
Look
before
the
snow
*NL*
blots
it
all
out
!
''
I
took
it
and
looked
.
The
two
men
might
be
Dr.
Seward
*NL*
and
Mr.
Morris
.
I
knew
at
all
events
that
neither
of
them
was
Jonathan
.
*NL*
At
the
same
time
I
_
knew
_
that
Jonathan
was
not
far
off
;
looking
around
*NL*
I
saw
on
the
north
side
of
the
coming
party
two
other
men
,
riding
at
*NL*
break-neck
speed
.
One
of
them
I
knew
was
Jonathan
,
and
the
other
I
took
,
*NL*
of
course
,
to
be
Lord
Godalming
.
They
,
too
,
were
pursuing
the
party
with
*NL*
the
cart
.
When
I
told
the
Professor
he
shouted
in
glee
like
a
schoolboy
,
*NL*
and
,
after
looking
intently
till
a
snow
fall
made
sight
impossible
,
he
*NL*
laid
his
Winchester
rifle
ready
for
use
against
the
boulder
at
the
*NL*
opening
of
our
shelter
.
``
They
are
all
converging
,
''
he
said
.
``
When
the
*NL*
time
comes
we
shall
have
gypsies
on
all
sides
.
''
I
got
out
my
revolver
*NL*
ready
to
hand
,
for
whilst
we
were
speaking
the
howling
of
wolves
came
*NL*
louder
and
closer
.
When
the
snow
storm
abated
a
moment
we
looked
again
.
*NL*
It
was
strange
to
see
the
snow
falling
in
such
heavy
flakes
close
to
us
,
*NL*
and
beyond
,
the
sun
shining
more
and
more
brightly
as
it
sank
down
*NL*
towards
the
far
mountain
tops
.
Sweeping
the
glass
all
around
us
I
could
*NL*
see
here
and
there
dots
moving
singly
and
in
twos
and
threes
and
larger
*NL*
numbers
--
the
wolves
were
gathering
for
their
prey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
instant
seemed
an
age
whilst
we
waited
.
The
wind
came
now
in
*NL*
fierce
bursts
,
and
the
snow
was
driven
with
fury
as
it
swept
upon
us
in
*NL*
circling
eddies
.
At
times
we
could
not
see
an
arm
's
length
before
us
;
*NL*
but
at
others
,
as
the
hollow-sounding
wind
swept
by
us
,
it
seemed
to
*NL*
clear
the
air-space
around
us
so
that
we
could
see
afar
off
.
We
had
of
*NL*
late
been
so
accustomed
to
watch
for
sunrise
and
sunset
,
that
we
knew
*NL*
with
fair
accuracy
when
it
would
be
;
and
we
knew
that
before
long
the
*NL*
sun
would
set
.
It
was
hard
to
believe
that
by
our
watches
it
was
less
*NL*
than
an
hour
that
we
waited
in
that
rocky
shelter
before
the
various
*NL*
bodies
began
to
converge
close
upon
us
.
The
wind
came
now
with
fiercer
*NL*
and
more
bitter
sweeps
,
and
more
steadily
from
the
north
.
It
seemingly
*NL*
had
driven
the
snow
clouds
from
us
,
for
,
with
only
occasional
bursts
,
*NL*
the
snow
fell
.
We
could
distinguish
clearly
the
individuals
of
each
*NL*
party
,
the
pursued
and
the
pursuers
.
Strangely
enough
those
pursued
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
realise
,
or
at
least
to
care
,
that
they
were
pursued
;
they
*NL*
seemed
,
however
,
to
hasten
with
redoubled
speed
as
the
sun
dropped
lower
*NL*
and
lower
on
the
mountain
tops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Closer
and
closer
they
drew
.
The
Professor
and
I
crouched
down
behind
*NL*
our
rock
,
and
held
our
weapons
ready
;
I
could
see
that
he
was
determined
*NL*
that
they
should
not
pass
.
One
and
all
were
quite
unaware
of
our
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
two
voices
shouted
out
to
:
``
Halt
!
''
One
was
my
Jonathan
's
,
*NL*
raised
in
a
high
key
of
passion
;
the
other
Mr.
Morris
'
strong
resolute
*NL*
tone
of
quiet
command
.
The
gypsies
may
not
have
known
the
language
,
but
*NL*
there
was
no
mistaking
the
tone
,
in
whatever
tongue
the
words
were
*NL*
spoken
.
Instinctively
they
reined
in
,
and
at
the
instant
Lord
Godalming
*NL*
and
Jonathan
dashed
up
at
one
side
and
Dr.
Seward
and
Mr.
Morris
on
the
*NL*
other
.
The
leader
of
the
gypsies
,
a
splendid-looking
fellow
who
sat
his
*NL*
horse
like
a
centaur
,
waved
them
back
,
and
in
a
fierce
voice
gave
to
his
*NL*
companions
some
word
to
proceed
.
They
lashed
the
horses
which
sprang
*NL*
forward
;
but
the
four
men
raised
their
Winchester
rifles
,
and
in
an
*NL*
unmistakable
way
commanded
them
to
stop
.
At
the
same
moment
Dr.
Van
*NL*
Helsing
and
I
rose
behind
the
rock
and
pointed
our
weapons
at
them
.
*NL*
Seeing
that
they
were
surrounded
the
men
tightened
their
reins
and
drew
*NL*
up
.
The
leader
turned
to
them
and
gave
a
word
at
which
every
man
of
the
*NL*
gypsy
party
drew
what
weapon
he
carried
,
knife
or
pistol
,
and
held
*NL*
himself
in
readiness
to
attack
.
Issue
was
joined
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
leader
,
with
a
quick
movement
of
his
rein
,
threw
his
horse
out
in
*NL*
front
,
and
pointing
first
to
the
sun
--
now
close
down
on
the
hill
*NL*
tops
--
and
then
to
the
castle
,
said
something
which
I
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
For
answer
,
all
four
men
of
our
party
threw
themselves
from
their
horses
*NL*
and
dashed
towards
the
cart
.
I
should
have
felt
terrible
fear
at
seeing
*NL*
Jonathan
in
such
danger
,
but
that
the
ardour
of
battle
must
have
been
*NL*
upon
me
as
well
as
the
rest
of
them
;
I
felt
no
fear
,
but
only
a
wild
,
*NL*
surging
desire
to
do
something
.
Seeing
the
quick
movement
of
our
*NL*
parties
,
the
leader
of
the
gypsies
gave
a
command
;
his
men
instantly
*NL*
formed
round
the
cart
in
a
sort
of
undisciplined
endeavour
,
each
one
*NL*
shouldering
and
pushing
the
other
in
his
eagerness
to
carry
out
the
*NL*
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
this
I
could
see
that
Jonathan
on
one
side
of
the
ring
*NL*
of
men
,
and
Quincey
on
the
other
,
were
forcing
a
way
to
the
cart
;
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
they
were
bent
on
finishing
their
task
before
the
sun
*NL*
should
set
.
Nothing
seemed
to
stop
or
even
to
hinder
them
.
Neither
the
*NL*
levelled
weapons
nor
the
flashing
knives
of
the
gypsies
in
front
,
nor
*NL*
the
howling
of
the
wolves
behind
,
appeared
to
even
attract
their
*NL*
attention
.
Jonathan
's
impetuosity
,
and
the
manifest
singleness
of
his
*NL*
purpose
,
seemed
to
overawe
those
in
front
of
him
;
instinctively
they
*NL*
cowered
,
aside
and
let
him
pass
.
In
an
instant
he
had
jumped
upon
the
*NL*
cart
,
and
,
with
a
strength
which
seemed
incredible
,
raised
the
great
*NL*
box
,
and
flung
it
over
the
wheel
to
the
ground
.
In
the
meantime
,
Mr.
*NL*
Morris
had
had
to
use
force
to
pass
through
his
side
of
the
ring
of
*NL*
Szgany
.
All
the
time
I
had
been
breathlessly
watching
Jonathan
I
had
,
*NL*
with
the
tail
of
my
eye
,
seen
him
pressing
desperately
forward
,
and
had
*NL*
seen
the
knives
of
the
gypsies
flash
as
he
won
a
way
through
them
,
and
*NL*
they
cut
at
him
.
He
had
parried
with
his
great
bowie
knife
,
and
at
first
*NL*
I
thought
that
he
too
had
come
through
in
safety
;
but
as
he
sprang
*NL*
beside
Jonathan
,
who
had
by
now
jumped
from
the
cart
,
I
could
see
that
*NL*
with
his
left
hand
he
was
clutching
at
his
side
,
and
that
the
blood
was
*NL*
spurting
through
his
fingers
.
He
did
not
delay
notwithstanding
this
,
for
*NL*
as
Jonathan
,
with
desperate
energy
,
attacked
one
end
of
the
chest
,
*NL*
attempting
to
prize
off
the
lid
with
his
great
Kukri
knife
,
he
attacked
*NL*
the
other
frantically
with
his
bowie
.
Under
the
efforts
of
both
men
the
*NL*
lid
began
to
yield
;
the
nails
drew
with
a
quick
screeching
sound
,
and
*NL*
the
top
of
the
box
was
thrown
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
gypsies
,
seeing
themselves
covered
by
the
Winchesters
,
*NL*
and
at
the
mercy
of
Lord
Godalming
and
Dr.
Seward
,
had
given
in
and
made
*NL*
no
resistance
.
The
sun
was
almost
down
on
the
mountain
tops
,
and
the
*NL*
shadows
of
the
whole
group
fell
long
upon
the
snow
.
I
saw
the
Count
*NL*
lying
within
the
box
upon
the
earth
,
some
of
which
the
rude
falling
from
*NL*
the
cart
had
scattered
over
him
.
He
was
deathly
pale
,
just
like
a
waxen
*NL*
image
,
and
the
red
eyes
glared
with
the
horrible
vindictive
look
which
I
*NL*
knew
too
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
looked
,
the
eyes
saw
the
sinking
sun
,
and
the
look
of
hate
in
them
*NL*
turned
to
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
on
the
instant
,
came
the
sweep
and
flash
of
Jonathan
's
great
knife
.
*NL*
I
shrieked
as
I
saw
it
shear
through
the
throat
;
whilst
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
Mr.
Morris
's
bowie
knife
plunged
into
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
a
miracle
;
but
before
our
very
eyes
,
and
almost
in
the
*NL*
drawing
of
a
breath
,
the
whole
body
crumble
into
dust
and
passed
from
*NL*
our
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
be
glad
as
long
as
I
live
that
even
in
that
moment
of
final
*NL*
dissolution
,
there
was
in
the
face
a
look
of
peace
,
such
as
I
never
*NL*
could
have
imagined
might
have
rested
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Castle
of
Dracula
now
stood
out
against
the
red
sky
,
and
every
stone
*NL*
of
its
broken
battlements
was
articulated
against
the
light
of
the
*NL*
setting
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsies
,
taking
us
as
in
some
way
the
cause
of
the
extraordinary
*NL*
disappearance
of
the
dead
man
,
turned
,
without
a
word
,
and
rode
away
as
*NL*
if
for
their
lives
.
Those
who
were
unmounted
jumped
upon
the
*NL*
leiter-wagon
and
shouted
to
the
horsemen
not
to
desert
them
.
The
wolves
,
*NL*
which
had
withdrawn
to
a
safe
distance
,
followed
in
their
wake
,
leaving
*NL*
us
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Morris
,
who
had
sunk
to
the
ground
,
leaned
on
his
elbow
,
holding
his
*NL*
hand
pressed
to
his
side
;
the
blood
still
gushed
through
his
fingers
.
I
*NL*
flew
to
him
,
for
the
Holy
circle
did
not
now
keep
me
back
;
so
did
the
*NL*
two
doctors
.
Jonathan
knelt
behind
him
and
the
wounded
man
laid
back
his
*NL*
head
on
his
shoulder
.
With
a
sigh
he
took
,
with
a
feeble
effort
,
my
hand
*NL*
in
that
of
his
own
which
was
unstained
.
He
must
have
seen
the
anguish
of
*NL*
my
heart
in
my
face
,
for
he
smiled
at
me
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
only
too
happy
to
have
been
of
any
service
!
Oh
,
God
!
''
he
cried
*NL*
suddenly
,
struggling
up
to
a
sitting
posture
and
pointing
to
me
,
``
It
was
*NL*
worth
for
this
to
die
!
Look
!
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
now
right
down
upon
the
mountain
top
,
and
the
red
gleams
*NL*
fell
upon
my
face
,
so
that
it
was
bathed
in
rosy
light
.
With
one
impulse
*NL*
the
men
sank
on
their
knees
and
a
deep
and
earnest
``
Amen
''
broke
from
all
*NL*
as
their
eyes
followed
the
pointing
of
his
finger
.
The
dying
man
*NL*
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
God
be
thanked
that
all
has
not
been
in
vain
!
See
!
the
snow
is
not
*NL*
more
stainless
than
her
forehead
!
The
curse
has
passed
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
to
our
bitter
grief
,
with
a
smile
and
in
silence
,
he
died
,
a
*NL*
gallant
gentleman
.

NOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
years
ago
we
all
went
through
the
flames
;
and
the
happiness
of
*NL*
some
of
us
since
then
is
,
we
think
,
well
worth
the
pain
we
endured
.
It
*NL*
is
an
added
joy
to
Mina
and
to
me
that
our
boy
's
birthday
is
the
same
*NL*
day
as
that
on
which
Quincey
Morris
died
.
His
mother
holds
,
I
know
,
the
*NL*
secret
belief
that
some
of
our
brave
friend
's
spirit
has
passed
into
*NL*
him
.
His
bundle
of
names
links
all
our
little
band
of
men
together
;
but
*NL*
we
call
him
Quincey
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
summer
of
this
year
we
made
a
journey
to
Transylvania
,
and
went
*NL*
over
the
old
ground
which
was
,
and
is
,
to
us
so
full
of
vivid
and
*NL*
terrible
memories
.
It
was
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
the
things
*NL*
which
we
had
seen
with
our
own
eyes
and
heard
with
our
own
ears
were
*NL*
living
truths
.
Every
trace
of
all
that
had
been
was
blotted
out
.
The
*NL*
castle
stood
as
before
,
reared
high
above
a
waste
of
desolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
home
we
were
talking
of
the
old
time
--
which
we
could
all
*NL*
look
back
on
without
despair
,
for
Godalming
and
Seward
are
both
happily
*NL*
married
.
I
took
the
papers
from
the
safe
where
they
had
been
ever
since
*NL*
our
return
so
long
ago
.
We
were
struck
with
the
fact
,
that
in
all
the
*NL*
mass
of
material
of
which
the
record
is
composed
,
there
is
hardly
one
*NL*
authentic
document
;
nothing
but
a
mass
of
typewriting
,
except
the
later
*NL*
note-books
of
Mina
and
Seward
and
myself
,
and
Van
Helsing
's
memorandum
.
*NL*
We
could
hardly
ask
any
one
,
even
did
we
wish
to
,
to
accept
these
as
*NL*
proofs
of
so
wild
a
story
.
Van
Helsing
summed
it
all
up
as
he
said
,
with
*NL*
our
boy
on
his
knee
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
want
no
proofs
;
we
ask
none
to
believe
us
!
This
boy
will
some
day
*NL*
know
what
a
brave
and
gallant
woman
his
mother
is
.
Already
he
knows
her
*NL*
sweetness
and
loving
care
;
later
on
he
will
understand
how
some
men
so
*NL*
loved
her
,
that
they
did
dare
much
for
her
sake
.
