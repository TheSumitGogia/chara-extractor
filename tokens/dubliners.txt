*NL*
THERE
was
no
hope
for
him
this
time
:
it
was
the
third
stroke
.
Night
*NL*
after
night
I
had
passed
the
house
-LRB-
it
was
vacation
time
-RRB-
and
studied
*NL*
the
lighted
square
of
window
:
and
night
after
night
I
had
found
it
*NL*
lighted
in
the
same
way
,
faintly
and
evenly
.
If
he
was
dead
,
I
thought
,
*NL*
I
would
see
the
reflection
of
candles
on
the
darkened
blind
for
I
knew
*NL*
that
two
candles
must
be
set
at
the
head
of
a
corpse
.
He
had
often
said
*NL*
to
me
:
``
I
am
not
long
for
this
world
,
''
and
I
had
thought
his
words
idle
.
*NL*
Now
I
knew
they
were
true
.
Every
night
as
I
gazed
up
at
the
window
*NL*
I
said
softly
to
myself
the
word
paralysis
.
It
had
always
sounded
*NL*
strangely
in
my
ears
,
like
the
word
gnomon
in
the
Euclid
and
the
word
*NL*
simony
in
the
Catechism
.
But
now
it
sounded
to
me
like
the
name
of
some
*NL*
maleficent
and
sinful
being
.
It
filled
me
with
fear
,
and
yet
I
longed
to
*NL*
be
nearer
to
it
and
to
look
upon
its
deadly
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Cotter
was
sitting
at
the
fire
,
smoking
,
when
I
came
downstairs
*NL*
to
supper
.
While
my
aunt
was
ladling
out
my
stirabout
he
said
,
as
if
*NL*
returning
to
some
former
remark
of
his
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
would
n't
say
he
was
exactly
...
but
there
was
something
queer
...
*NL*
there
was
something
uncanny
about
him
.
I
'll
tell
you
my
opinion
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
puff
at
his
pipe
,
no
doubt
arranging
his
opinion
in
his
*NL*
mind
.
Tiresome
old
fool
!
When
we
knew
him
first
he
used
to
be
rather
*NL*
interesting
,
talking
of
faints
and
worms
;
but
I
soon
grew
tired
of
him
*NL*
and
his
endless
stories
about
the
distillery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
my
own
theory
about
it
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
think
it
was
one
of
*NL*
those
...
peculiar
cases
...
But
it
's
hard
to
say
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
puff
again
at
his
pipe
without
giving
us
his
theory
.
My
*NL*
uncle
saw
me
staring
and
said
to
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
so
your
old
friend
is
gone
,
you
'll
be
sorry
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Flynn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Cotter
here
has
just
told
us
.
He
was
passing
by
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
that
I
was
under
observation
so
I
continued
eating
as
if
the
news
*NL*
had
not
interested
me
.
My
uncle
explained
to
old
Cotter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
youngster
and
he
were
great
friends
.
The
old
chap
taught
him
a
*NL*
great
deal
,
mind
you
;
and
they
say
he
had
a
great
wish
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
have
mercy
on
his
soul
,
''
said
my
aunt
piously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Cotter
looked
at
me
for
a
while
.
I
felt
that
his
little
beady
black
*NL*
eyes
were
examining
me
but
I
would
not
satisfy
him
by
looking
up
from
my
*NL*
plate
.
He
returned
to
his
pipe
and
finally
spat
rudely
into
the
grate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
like
children
of
mine
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
have
too
much
to
say
to
*NL*
a
man
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
,
Mr.
Cotter
?
''
asked
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
mean
is
,
''
said
old
Cotter
,
``
it
's
bad
for
children
.
My
idea
is
:
*NL*
let
a
young
lad
run
about
and
play
with
young
lads
of
his
own
age
and
*NL*
not
be
...
Am
I
right
,
Jack
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
my
principle
,
too
,
''
said
my
uncle
.
``
Let
him
learn
to
box
his
*NL*
corner
.
That
's
what
I
'm
always
saying
to
that
Rosicrucian
there
:
take
*NL*
exercise
.
Why
,
when
I
was
a
nipper
every
morning
of
my
life
I
had
a
cold
*NL*
bath
,
winter
and
summer
.
And
that
's
what
stands
to
me
now
.
Education
*NL*
is
all
very
fine
and
large
...
Mr.
Cotter
might
take
a
pick
of
that
leg
*NL*
mutton
,
''
he
added
to
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
not
for
me
,
''
said
old
Cotter
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
brought
the
dish
from
the
safe
and
put
it
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
do
you
think
it
's
not
good
for
children
,
Mr.
Cotter
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
bad
for
children
,
''
said
old
Cotter
,
``
because
their
minds
are
so
*NL*
impressionable
.
When
children
see
things
like
that
,
you
know
,
it
has
an
*NL*
effect
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
crammed
my
mouth
with
stirabout
for
fear
I
might
give
utterance
to
my
*NL*
anger
.
Tiresome
old
red-nosed
imbecile
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
when
I
fell
asleep
.
Though
I
was
angry
with
old
Cotter
for
*NL*
alluding
to
me
as
a
child
,
I
puzzled
my
head
to
extract
meaning
from
his
*NL*
unfinished
sentences
.
In
the
dark
of
my
room
I
imagined
that
I
saw
again
*NL*
the
heavy
grey
face
of
the
paralytic
.
I
drew
the
blankets
over
my
head
*NL*
and
tried
to
think
of
Christmas
.
But
the
grey
face
still
followed
me
.
It
*NL*
murmured
;
and
I
understood
that
it
desired
to
confess
something
.
I
felt
*NL*
my
soul
receding
into
some
pleasant
and
vicious
region
;
and
there
again
*NL*
I
found
it
waiting
for
me
.
It
began
to
confess
to
me
in
a
murmuring
*NL*
voice
and
I
wondered
why
it
smiled
continually
and
why
the
lips
were
so
*NL*
moist
with
spittle
.
But
then
I
remembered
that
it
had
died
of
paralysis
*NL*
and
I
felt
that
I
too
was
smiling
feebly
as
if
to
absolve
the
simoniac
*NL*
of
his
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
after
breakfast
I
went
down
to
look
at
the
little
house
*NL*
in
Great
Britain
Street
.
It
was
an
unassuming
shop
,
registered
under
*NL*
the
vague
name
of
Drapery
.
The
drapery
consisted
mainly
of
children
's
*NL*
bootees
and
umbrellas
;
and
on
ordinary
days
a
notice
used
to
hang
in
the
*NL*
window
,
saying
:
Umbrellas
Re-covered
.
No
notice
was
visible
now
for
*NL*
the
shutters
were
up
.
A
crape
bouquet
was
tied
to
the
doork-nocker
with
*NL*
ribbon
.
Two
poor
women
and
a
telegram
boy
were
reading
the
card
pinned
*NL*
on
the
crape
.
I
also
approached
and
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
July
1st
,
1895
*NL*
The
Rev.
James
Flynn
-LRB-
formerly
of
*NL*
S.
Catherine
's
Church
,
Meath
Street
-RRB-
,
*NL*
aged
sixty-five
years
.
*NL*
R.
I.
P
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reading
of
the
card
persuaded
me
that
he
was
dead
and
I
was
*NL*
disturbed
to
find
myself
at
check
.
Had
he
not
been
dead
I
would
have
*NL*
gone
into
the
little
dark
room
behind
the
shop
to
find
him
sitting
in
*NL*
his
arm-chair
by
the
fire
,
nearly
smothered
in
his
great-coat
.
Perhaps
*NL*
my
aunt
would
have
given
me
a
packet
of
High
Toast
for
him
and
this
*NL*
present
would
have
roused
him
from
his
stupefied
doze
.
It
was
always
I
*NL*
who
emptied
the
packet
into
his
black
snuff-box
for
his
hands
trembled
*NL*
too
much
to
allow
him
to
do
this
without
spilling
half
the
snuff
about
*NL*
the
floor
.
Even
as
he
raised
his
large
trembling
hand
to
his
nose
little
*NL*
clouds
of
smoke
dribbled
through
his
fingers
over
the
front
of
his
coat
.
*NL*
It
may
have
been
these
constant
showers
of
snuff
which
gave
his
ancient
*NL*
priestly
garments
their
green
faded
look
for
the
red
handkerchief
,
*NL*
blackened
,
as
it
always
was
,
with
the
snuff-stains
of
a
week
,
with
which
*NL*
he
tried
to
brush
away
the
fallen
grains
,
was
quite
inefficacious
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wished
to
go
in
and
look
at
him
but
I
had
not
the
courage
to
knock
.
I
*NL*
walked
away
slowly
along
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
,
reading
all
the
*NL*
theatrical
advertisements
in
the
shopwindows
as
I
went
.
I
found
it
*NL*
strange
that
neither
I
nor
the
day
seemed
in
a
mourning
mood
and
I
felt
*NL*
even
annoyed
at
discovering
in
myself
a
sensation
of
freedom
as
if
I
had
*NL*
been
freed
from
something
by
his
death
.
I
wondered
at
this
for
,
as
my
*NL*
uncle
had
said
the
night
before
,
he
had
taught
me
a
great
deal
.
He
had
*NL*
studied
in
the
Irish
college
in
Rome
and
he
had
taught
me
to
pronounce
*NL*
Latin
properly
.
He
had
told
me
stories
about
the
catacombs
and
about
*NL*
Napoleon
Bonaparte
,
and
he
had
explained
to
me
the
meaning
of
the
*NL*
different
ceremonies
of
the
Mass
and
of
the
different
vestments
worn
*NL*
by
the
priest
.
Sometimes
he
had
amused
himself
by
putting
difficult
*NL*
questions
to
me
,
asking
me
what
one
should
do
in
certain
circumstances
*NL*
or
whether
such
and
such
sins
were
mortal
or
venial
or
only
*NL*
imperfections
.
His
questions
showed
me
how
complex
and
mysterious
were
*NL*
certain
institutions
of
the
Church
which
I
had
always
regarded
as
*NL*
the
simplest
acts
.
The
duties
of
the
priest
towards
the
Eucharist
and
*NL*
towards
the
secrecy
of
the
confessional
seemed
so
grave
to
me
that
I
*NL*
wondered
how
anybody
had
ever
found
in
himself
the
courage
to
undertake
*NL*
them
;
and
I
was
not
surprised
when
he
told
me
that
the
fathers
of
the
*NL*
Church
had
written
books
as
thick
as
the
Post
Office
Directory
and
as
*NL*
closely
printed
as
the
law
notices
in
the
newspaper
,
elucidating
all
*NL*
these
intricate
questions
.
Often
when
I
thought
of
this
I
could
make
*NL*
no
answer
or
only
a
very
foolish
and
halting
one
upon
which
he
used
*NL*
to
smile
and
nod
his
head
twice
or
thrice
.
Sometimes
he
used
to
put
me
*NL*
through
the
responses
of
the
Mass
which
he
had
made
me
learn
by
heart
;
*NL*
and
,
as
I
pattered
,
he
used
to
smile
pensively
and
nod
his
head
,
now
and
*NL*
then
pushing
huge
pinches
of
snuff
up
each
nostril
alternately
.
When
he
*NL*
smiled
he
used
to
uncover
his
big
discoloured
teeth
and
let
his
tongue
*NL*
lie
upon
his
lower
lip
--
a
habit
which
had
made
me
feel
uneasy
in
the
*NL*
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
before
I
knew
him
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
walked
along
in
the
sun
I
remembered
old
Cotter
's
words
and
tried
*NL*
to
remember
what
had
happened
afterwards
in
the
dream
.
I
remembered
*NL*
that
I
had
noticed
long
velvet
curtains
and
a
swinging
lamp
of
antique
*NL*
fashion
.
I
felt
that
I
had
been
very
far
away
,
in
some
land
where
the
*NL*
customs
were
strange
--
in
Persia
,
I
thought
...
But
I
could
not
remember
*NL*
the
end
of
the
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
my
aunt
took
me
with
her
to
visit
the
house
of
mourning
.
*NL*
It
was
after
sunset
;
but
the
window-panes
of
the
houses
that
looked
*NL*
to
the
west
reflected
the
tawny
gold
of
a
great
bank
of
clouds
.
Nannie
*NL*
received
us
in
the
hall
;
and
,
as
it
would
have
been
unseemly
to
have
*NL*
shouted
at
her
,
my
aunt
shook
hands
with
her
for
all
.
The
old
woman
*NL*
pointed
upwards
interrogatively
and
,
on
my
aunt
's
nodding
,
proceeded
to
*NL*
toil
up
the
narrow
staircase
before
us
,
her
bowed
head
being
scarcely
*NL*
above
the
level
of
the
banister-rail
.
At
the
first
landing
she
stopped
*NL*
and
beckoned
us
forward
encouragingly
towards
the
open
door
of
the
*NL*
dead-room
.
My
aunt
went
in
and
the
old
woman
,
seeing
that
I
hesitated
to
*NL*
enter
,
began
to
beckon
to
me
again
repeatedly
with
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
in
on
tiptoe
.
The
room
through
the
lace
end
of
the
blind
was
*NL*
suffused
with
dusky
golden
light
amid
which
the
candles
looked
like
pale
*NL*
thin
flames
.
He
had
been
coffined
.
Nannie
gave
the
lead
and
we
three
*NL*
knelt
down
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
I
pretended
to
pray
but
I
could
not
*NL*
gather
my
thoughts
because
the
old
woman
's
mutterings
distracted
me
.
I
*NL*
noticed
how
clumsily
her
skirt
was
hooked
at
the
back
and
how
the
heels
*NL*
of
her
cloth
boots
were
trodden
down
all
to
one
side
.
The
fancy
came
to
*NL*
me
that
the
old
priest
was
smiling
as
he
lay
there
in
his
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
.
When
we
rose
and
went
up
to
the
head
of
the
bed
I
saw
that
he
*NL*
was
not
smiling
.
There
he
lay
,
solemn
and
copious
,
vested
as
for
the
*NL*
altar
,
his
large
hands
loosely
retaining
a
chalice
.
His
face
was
very
*NL*
truculent
,
grey
and
massive
,
with
black
cavernous
nostrils
and
circled
*NL*
by
a
scanty
white
fur
.
There
was
a
heavy
odour
in
the
room
--
the
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
blessed
ourselves
and
came
away
.
In
the
little
room
downstairs
we
*NL*
found
Eliza
seated
in
his
arm-chair
in
state
.
I
groped
my
way
towards
my
*NL*
usual
chair
in
the
corner
while
Nannie
went
to
the
sideboard
and
brought
*NL*
out
a
decanter
of
sherry
and
some
wine-glasses
.
She
set
these
on
the
*NL*
table
and
invited
us
to
take
a
little
glass
of
wine
.
Then
,
at
her
*NL*
sister
's
bidding
,
she
filled
out
the
sherry
into
the
glasses
and
passed
*NL*
them
to
us
.
She
pressed
me
to
take
some
cream
crackers
also
but
I
*NL*
declined
because
I
thought
I
would
make
too
much
noise
eating
them
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
be
somewhat
disappointed
at
my
refusal
and
went
over
quietly
*NL*
to
the
sofa
where
she
sat
down
behind
her
sister
.
No
one
spoke
:
we
all
*NL*
gazed
at
the
empty
fireplace
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
waited
until
Eliza
sighed
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
he
's
gone
to
a
better
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eliza
sighed
again
and
bowed
her
head
in
assent
.
My
aunt
fingered
the
*NL*
stem
of
her
wine-glass
before
sipping
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
...
peacefully
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
quite
peacefully
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Eliza
.
``
You
could
n't
tell
when
the
*NL*
breath
went
out
of
him
.
He
had
a
beautiful
death
,
God
be
praised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
everything
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
O'Rourke
was
in
with
him
a
Tuesday
and
anointed
him
and
prepared
*NL*
him
and
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knew
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
quite
resigned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
looks
quite
resigned
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
the
woman
we
had
in
to
wash
him
said
.
She
said
he
just
*NL*
looked
as
if
he
was
asleep
,
he
looked
that
peaceful
and
resigned
.
No
one
*NL*
would
think
he
'd
make
such
a
beautiful
corpse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sipped
a
little
more
from
her
glass
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Miss
Flynn
,
at
any
rate
it
must
be
a
great
comfort
for
you
to
*NL*
know
that
you
did
all
you
could
for
him
.
You
were
both
very
kind
to
him
,
*NL*
I
must
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eliza
smoothed
her
dress
over
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
poor
James
!
''
she
said
.
``
God
knows
we
done
all
we
could
,
as
poor
as
*NL*
we
are
--
we
would
n't
see
him
want
anything
while
he
was
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nannie
had
leaned
her
head
against
the
sofa-pillow
and
seemed
about
to
*NL*
fall
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
poor
Nannie
,
''
said
Eliza
,
looking
at
her
,
``
she
's
wore
out

All
*NL*
the
work
we
had
,
she
and
me
,
getting
in
the
woman
to
wash
him

then
*NL*
laying
him
out
and
then
the
coffin
and
then
arranging
about
the
Mass
in
*NL*
the
chapel
.
Only
for
Father
O'Rourke
I
do
n't
know
what
we
'd
have
done
at
all

*NL*
It
was
him
brought
us
all
them
flowers
and
them
two
candlesticks
out
of
*NL*
the
chapel
and
wrote
out
the
notice
for
the
Freeman
's
General
and
took
*NL*
charge
of
all
the
papers
for
the
cemetery
and
poor
James
's
insurance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
that
good
of
him
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eliza
closed
her
eyes
and
shook
her
head
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
's
no
friends
like
the
old
friends

she
said
,
``
when
all
is
*NL*
said
and
done

no
friends
that
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
that
's
true

said
my
aunt
.
``

I
'm
sure
now
that

all
your
kindness
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
poor
James
!
''
said
Eliza
.
``
He
was
no
great
trouble
to
us

You

would
n't
hear
him
in

now

Still

I

he

gone

all
to
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
when

my

said
Eliza
.
``
I
wo
n't
be
bringing
him
in
his
cup

beef-tea
any
more

,
sending
him
his
snuff
.
Ah
,
poor
James
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
,
as
if
she
were
communing
with
the
past
and
then
said
*NL*
shrewdly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
,
I
noticed
there
was
something
queer
coming
over
him
latterly
.
*NL*
Whenever
I
'd
bring
in
his
soup
to
him
there
I
'd
find
him
with
his
*NL*
breviary
fallen
to
the
floor
,
lying
back
in
the
chair
and
his
mouth
*NL*
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
a
finger
against
her
nose
and
frowned
:
then
she
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
still
and
all
he
kept
on
saying
that
before
the
summer
was
over
*NL*
he
'd
go
out
for
a
drive
one
fine
day
just
to
see
the
old
house
again
*NL*
where
we
were
all
born
down
in
Irishtown
and
take
me
and
Nannie
with
*NL*
him
.
If
we
could
only
get
one
of
them
new-fangled
carriages
that
makes
*NL*
no
noise
that
Father
O'Rourke
told
him
about
--
them
with
the
rheumatic
*NL*
wheels
--
for
the
day
cheap

he
said
,
at
Johnny
Rush
's
over
the
way
there
*NL*
and
drive
out
the
three
of
us
together
of
a
Sunday
evening
.
He
had
his
*NL*
mind
set
on
that
...
Poor
James
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord
have
mercy
on
his
soul
!
''
said
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eliza
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
wiped
her
eyes
with
it
.
Then
she
put
*NL*
it
back
again
in
her
pocket
and
gazed
into
the
empty
grate
for
some
time
*NL*
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
too
scrupulous
always
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
duties
of
the
priesthood
*NL*
was
too
much
for
him
.
And
then
his
life
was
,
you
might
say
,
crossed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
He
was
a
disappointed
man
.
You
could
see
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
took
possession
of
the
little
room
and
,
under
cover
of
it
,
I
*NL*
approached
the
table
and
tasted
my
sherry
and
then
returned
quietly
to
*NL*
my
chair
in
the
comer
.
Eliza
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
a
deep
revery
.
*NL*
We
waited
respectfully
for
her
to
break
the
silence
:
and
after
a
long
*NL*
pause
she
said
slowly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
that
chalice
he
broke
...
That
was
the
beginning
of
it
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
they
say
it
was
all
right
,
that
it
contained
nothing
,
I
mean
.
*NL*
But
still
...
They
say
it
was
the
boy
's
fault
.
But
poor
James
was
so
*NL*
nervous
,
God
be
merciful
to
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
that
it
?
''
said
my
aunt
.
``
I
heard
something
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eliza
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
affected
his
mind
,
''
she
said
.
``
After
that
he
began
to
mope
by
*NL*
himself
,
talking
to
no
one
and
wandering
about
by
himself
.
So
one
night
*NL*
he
was
wanted
for
to
go
on
a
call
and
they
could
n't
find
him
anywhere
.
*NL*
They
looked
high
up
and
low
down
;
and
still
they
could
n't
see
a
sight
*NL*
of
him
anywhere
.
So
then
the
clerk
suggested
to
try
the
chapel
.
So
*NL*
then
they
got
the
keys
and
opened
the
chapel
and
the
clerk
and
Father
*NL*
O'Rourke
and
another
priest
that
was
there
brought
in
a
light
for
to
*NL*
look
for
him
...
And
what
do
you
think
but
there
he
was
,
sitting
up
by
*NL*
himself
in
the
dark
in
his
confession-box
,
wide-awake
and
laughing-like
*NL*
softly
to
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
suddenly
as
if
to
listen
.
I
too
listened
;
but
there
was
no
*NL*
sound
in
the
house
:
and
I
knew
that
the
old
priest
was
lying
still
in
*NL*
his
coffin
as
we
had
seen
him
,
solemn
and
truculent
in
death
,
an
idle
*NL*
chalice
on
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eliza
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wide-awake
and
laughing-like
to
himself
...
So
then
,
of
course
,
when
*NL*
they
saw
that
,
that
made
them
think
that
there
was
something
gone
wrong
*NL*
with
him
...

*NL*
*NL*
AN
ENCOUNTER
*NL*
*NL*
IT
WAS
Joe
Dillon
who
introduced
the
Wild
West
to
us
.
He
had
a
little
*NL*
library
made
up
of
old
numbers
of
The
Union
Jack
,
Pluck
and
The
*NL*
Halfpenny
Marvel
.
Every
evening
after
school
we
met
in
his
back
garden
*NL*
and
arranged
Indian
battles
.
He
and
his
fat
young
brother
Leo
,
the
*NL*
idler
,
held
the
loft
of
the
stable
while
we
tried
to
carry
it
by
storm
;
*NL*
or
we
fought
a
pitched
battle
on
the
grass
.
But
,
however
well
we
fought
,
*NL*
we
never
won
siege
or
battle
and
all
our
bouts
ended
with
Joe
Dillon
's
*NL*
war
dance
of
victory
.
His
parents
went
to
eight-o'clock
mass
every
*NL*
morning
in
Gardiner
Street
and
the
peaceful
odour
of
Mrs.
Dillon
was
*NL*
prevalent
in
the
hall
of
the
house
.
But
he
played
too
fiercely
for
us
*NL*
who
were
younger
and
more
timid
.
He
looked
like
some
kind
of
an
Indian
*NL*
when
he
capered
round
the
garden
,
an
old
tea-cosy
on
his
head
,
beating
a
*NL*
tin
with
his
fist
and
yelling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ya
!
yaka
,
yaka
,
yaka
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
was
incredulous
when
it
was
reported
that
he
had
a
vocation
for
*NL*
the
priesthood
.
Nevertheless
it
was
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
spirit
of
unruliness
diffused
itself
among
us
and
,
under
its
*NL*
influence
,
differences
of
culture
and
constitution
were
waived
.
We
*NL*
banded
ourselves
together
,
some
boldly
,
some
in
jest
and
some
almost
in
*NL*
fear
:
and
of
the
number
of
these
latter
,
the
reluctant
Indians
who
*NL*
were
afraid
to
seem
studious
or
lacking
in
robustness
,
I
was
one
.
The
*NL*
adventures
related
in
the
literature
of
the
Wild
West
were
remote
from
*NL*
my
nature
but
,
at
least
,
they
opened
doors
of
escape
.
I
liked
better
*NL*
some
American
detective
stories
which
were
traversed
from
time
to
time
*NL*
by
unkempt
fierce
and
beautiful
girls
.
Though
there
was
nothing
wrong
*NL*
in
these
stories
and
though
their
intention
was
sometimes
literary
*NL*
they
were
circulated
secretly
at
school
.
One
day
when
Father
Butler
was
*NL*
hearing
the
four
pages
of
Roman
History
clumsy
Leo
Dillon
was
discovered
*NL*
with
a
copy
of
The
Halfpenny
Marvel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
page
or
this
page
?
This
page
Now
,
Dillon
,
up
!
`
Hardly
had
the
*NL*
day
'
...
Go
on
!
What
day
?
`
Hardly
had
the
day
dawned
'
...
Have
you
studied
*NL*
it
?
What
have
you
there
in
your
pocket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
's
heart
palpitated
as
Leo
Dillon
handed
up
the
paper
and
*NL*
everyone
assumed
an
innocent
face
.
Father
Butler
turned
over
the
pages
,
*NL*
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
rubbish
?
''
he
said
.
``
The
Apache
Chief
!
Is
this
what
you
*NL*
read
instead
of
studying
your
Roman
History
?
Let
me
not
find
any
more
*NL*
of
this
wretched
stuff
in
this
college
.
The
man
who
wrote
it
,
I
suppose
,
*NL*
was
some
wretched
fellow
who
writes
these
things
for
a
drink
.
I
'm
*NL*
surprised
at
boys
like
you
,
educated
,
reading
such
stuff
.
I
could
*NL*
understand
it
if
you
were
...
National
School
boys
.
Now
,
Dillon
,
I
advise
*NL*
you
strongly
,
get
at
your
work
or
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
rebuke
during
the
sober
hours
of
school
paled
much
of
the
glory
of
*NL*
the
Wild
West
for
me
and
the
confused
puffy
face
of
Leo
Dillon
awakened
*NL*
one
of
my
consciences
.
But
when
the
restraining
influence
of
the
school
*NL*
was
at
a
distance
I
began
to
hunger
again
for
wild
sensations
,
for
the
*NL*
escape
which
those
chronicles
of
disorder
alone
seemed
to
offer
me
.
The
*NL*
mimic
warfare
of
the
evening
became
at
last
as
wearisome
to
me
as
the
*NL*
routine
of
school
in
the
morning
because
I
wanted
real
adventures
to
*NL*
happen
to
myself
.
But
real
adventures
,
I
reflected
,
do
not
happen
to
*NL*
people
who
remain
at
home
:
they
must
be
sought
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
holidays
were
near
at
hand
when
I
made
up
my
mind
to
break
*NL*
out
of
the
weariness
of
school-life
for
one
day
at
least
.
With
Leo
Dillon
*NL*
and
a
boy
named
Mahony
I
planned
a
day
's
miching
.
Each
of
us
saved
up
*NL*
sixpence
.
We
were
to
meet
at
ten
in
the
morning
on
the
Canal
Bridge
.
*NL*
Mahony
's
big
sister
was
to
write
an
excuse
for
him
and
Leo
Dillon
was
to
*NL*
tell
his
brother
to
say
he
was
sick
.
We
arranged
to
go
along
the
Wharf
*NL*
Road
until
we
came
to
the
ships
,
then
to
cross
in
the
ferryboat
and
walk
*NL*
out
to
see
the
Pigeon
House
.
Leo
Dillon
was
afraid
we
might
meet
Father
*NL*
Butler
or
someone
out
of
the
college
;
but
Mahony
asked
,
very
sensibly
,
*NL*
what
would
Father
Butler
be
doing
out
at
the
Pigeon
House
.
We
were
*NL*
reassured
:
and
I
brought
the
first
stage
of
the
plot
to
an
end
by
*NL*
collecting
sixpence
from
the
other
two
,
at
the
same
time
showing
them
*NL*
my
own
sixpence
.
When
we
were
making
the
last
arrangements
on
the
eve
we
*NL*
were
all
vaguely
excited
.
We
shook
hands
,
laughing
,
and
Mahony
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
tomorrow
,
mates
!

That
night
I
slept
badly
.
In
the
morning
I
was
first-comer
to
the
bridge
*NL*
as
I
lived
nearest
.
I
hid
my
books
in
the
long
grass
near
the
ashpit
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
garden
where
nobody
ever
came
and
hurried
along
the
canal
*NL*
bank
.
It
was
a
mild
sunny
morning
in
the
first
week
of
June
.
I
sat
up
*NL*
on
the
coping
of
the
bridge
admiring
my
frail
canvas
shoes
which
I
had
*NL*
diligently
pipeclayed
overnight
and
watching
the
docile
horses
pulling
*NL*
a
tramload
of
business
people
up
the
hill
.
All
the
branches
of
the
tall
*NL*
trees
which
lined
the
mall
were
gay
with
little
light
green
leaves
and
*NL*
the
sunlight
slanted
through
them
on
to
the
water
.
The
granite
stone
of
*NL*
the
bridge
was
beginning
to
be
warm
and
I
began
to
pat
it
with
my
hands
*NL*
in
time
to
an
air
in
my
head
.
I
was
very
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
been
sitting
there
for
five
or
ten
minutes
I
saw
Mahony
's
*NL*
grey
suit
approaching
.
He
came
up
the
hill
,
smiling
,
and
clambered
*NL*
up
beside
me
on
the
bridge
.
While
we
were
waiting
he
brought
out
*NL*
the
catapult
which
bulged
from
his
inner
pocket
and
explained
some
*NL*
improvements
which
he
had
made
in
it
.
I
asked
him
why
he
had
brought
it
*NL*
and
he
told
me
he
had
brought
it
to
have
some
gas
with
the
birds
.
Mahony
*NL*
used
slang
freely
,
and
spoke
of
Father
Butler
as
Old
Bunser
.
We
waited
*NL*
on
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
but
still
there
was
no
sign
of
Leo
*NL*
Dillon
.
Mahony
,
at
last
,
jumped
down
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
.
I
knew
Fatty
'd
funk
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
his
sixpence
...
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
forfeit
,
''
said
Mahony
.
``
And
so
much
the
better
for
us
--
a
bob
and
*NL*
a
tanner
instead
of
a
bob
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
along
the
North
Strand
Road
till
we
came
to
the
Vitriol
Works
*NL*
and
then
turned
to
the
right
along
the
Wharf
Road
.
Mahony
began
to
play
*NL*
the
Indian
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
public
sight
.
He
chased
a
crowd
*NL*
of
ragged
girls
,
brandishing
his
unloaded
catapult
and
,
when
two
ragged
*NL*
boys
began
,
out
of
chivalry
,
to
fling
stones
at
us
,
he
proposed
that
we
*NL*
should
charge
them
.
I
objected
that
the
boys
were
too
small
and
so
we
*NL*
walked
on
,
the
ragged
troop
screaming
after
us
:
``
Swaddlers
!
*NL*
Swaddlers
!
''
thinking
that
we
were
Protestants
because
Mahony
,
who
was
*NL*
dark-complexioned
,
wore
the
silver
badge
of
a
cricket
club
in
his
cap
.
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
Smoothing
Iron
we
arranged
a
siege
;
but
it
was
a
*NL*
failure
because
you
must
have
at
least
three
.
We
revenged
ourselves
on
*NL*
Leo
Dillon
by
saying
what
a
funk
he
was
and
guessing
how
many
he
would
*NL*
get
at
three
o'clock
from
Mr.
Ryan
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
then
near
the
river
.
We
spent
a
long
time
walking
about
the
*NL*
noisy
streets
flanked
by
high
stone
walls
,
watching
the
working
of
*NL*
cranes
and
engines
and
often
being
shouted
at
for
our
immobility
by
the
*NL*
drivers
of
groaning
carts
.
It
was
noon
when
we
reached
the
quays
and
,
as
*NL*
all
the
labourers
seemed
to
be
eating
their
lunches
,
we
bought
two
big
*NL*
currant
buns
and
sat
down
to
eat
them
on
some
metal
piping
beside
the
*NL*
river
.
We
pleased
ourselves
with
the
spectacle
of
Dublin
's
commerce
--
the
*NL*
barges
signalled
from
far
away
by
their
curls
of
woolly
smoke
,
the
brown
*NL*
fishing
fleet
beyond
Ringsend
,
the
big
white
sailing-vessel
which
was
*NL*
being
discharged
on
the
opposite
quay
.
Mahony
said
it
would
be
right
*NL*
skit
to
run
away
to
sea
on
one
of
those
big
ships
and
even
I
,
looking
at
*NL*
the
high
masts
,
saw
,
or
imagined
,
the
geography
which
had
been
scantily
*NL*
dosed
to
me
at
school
gradually
taking
substance
under
my
eyes
.
School
*NL*
and
home
seemed
to
recede
from
us
and
their
influences
upon
us
seemed
to
*NL*
wane
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
crossed
the
Liffey
in
the
ferryboat
,
paying
our
toll
to
be
*NL*
transported
in
the
company
of
two
labourers
and
a
little
Jew
with
a
bag
.
*NL*
We
were
serious
to
the
point
of
solemnity
,
but
once
during
the
short
*NL*
voyage
our
eyes
met
and
we
laughed
.
When
we
landed
we
watched
the
*NL*
discharging
of
the
graceful
threemaster
which
we
had
observed
from
the
*NL*
other
quay
.
Some
bystander
said
that
she
was
a
Norwegian
vessel
.
I
went
*NL*
to
the
stern
and
tried
to
decipher
the
legend
upon
it
but
,
failing
to
do
*NL*
so
,
I
came
back
and
examined
the
foreign
sailors
to
see
had
any
of
them
*NL*
green
eyes
for
I
had
some
confused
notion
...
The
sailors
'
eyes
were
*NL*
blue
and
grey
and
even
black
.
The
only
sailor
whose
eyes
could
have
been
*NL*
called
green
was
a
tall
man
who
amused
the
crowd
on
the
quay
by
calling
*NL*
out
cheerfully
every
time
the
planks
fell
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
All
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
tired
of
this
sight
we
wandered
slowly
into
Ringsend
.
The
*NL*
day
had
grown
sultry
,
and
in
the
windows
of
the
grocers
'
shops
musty
*NL*
biscuits
lay
bleaching
.
We
bought
some
biscuits
and
chocolate
which
*NL*
we
ate
sedulously
as
we
wandered
through
the
squalid
streets
where
the
*NL*
families
of
the
fishermen
live
.
We
could
find
no
dairy
and
so
we
went
*NL*
into
a
huckster
's
shop
and
bought
a
bottle
of
raspberry
lemonade
each
.
*NL*
Refreshed
by
this
,
Mahony
chased
a
cat
down
a
lane
,
but
the
cat
escaped
*NL*
into
a
wide
field
.
We
both
felt
rather
tired
and
when
we
reached
the
*NL*
field
we
made
at
once
for
a
sloping
bank
over
the
ridge
of
which
we
*NL*
could
see
the
Dodder
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
late
and
we
were
too
tired
to
carry
out
our
project
of
*NL*
visiting
the
Pigeon
House
.
We
had
to
be
home
before
four
o'clock
lest
*NL*
our
adventure
should
be
discovered
.
Mahony
looked
regretfully
at
his
*NL*
catapult
and
I
had
to
suggest
going
home
by
train
before
he
regained
*NL*
any
cheerfulness
.
The
sun
went
in
behind
some
clouds
and
left
us
to
our
*NL*
jaded
thoughts
and
the
crumbs
of
our
provisions
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nobody
but
ourselves
in
the
field
.
When
we
had
lain
on
the
*NL*
bank
for
some
time
without
speaking
I
saw
a
man
approaching
from
the
far
*NL*
end
of
the
field
.
I
watched
him
lazily
as
I
chewed
one
of
those
green
*NL*
stems
on
which
girls
tell
fortunes
.
He
came
along
by
the
bank
slowly
.
He
*NL*
walked
with
one
hand
upon
his
hip
and
in
the
other
hand
he
held
a
stick
*NL*
with
which
he
tapped
the
turf
lightly
.
He
was
shabbily
dressed
in
a
suit
*NL*
of
greenish-black
and
wore
what
we
used
to
call
a
jerry
hat
with
a
high
*NL*
crown
.
He
seemed
to
be
fairly
old
for
his
moustache
was
ashen-grey
.
When
*NL*
he
passed
at
our
feet
he
glanced
up
at
us
quickly
and
then
continued
his
*NL*
way
.
We
followed
him
with
our
eyes
and
saw
that
when
he
had
gone
on
for
*NL*
perhaps
fifty
paces
he
turned
about
and
began
to
retrace
his
steps
.
He
*NL*
walked
towards
us
very
slowly
,
always
tapping
the
ground
with
his
stick
,
*NL*
so
slowly
that
I
thought
he
was
looking
for
something
in
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
when
he
came
level
with
us
and
bade
us
good-day
.
We
answered
*NL*
him
and
he
sat
down
beside
us
on
the
slope
slowly
and
with
great
care
.
*NL*
He
began
to
talk
of
the
weather
,
saying
that
it
would
be
a
very
hot
*NL*
summer
and
adding
that
the
seasons
had
changed
greatly
since
he
was
a
*NL*
boy
--
a
long
time
ago
.
He
said
that
the
happiest
time
of
one
's
life
was
*NL*
undoubtedly
one
's
school-boy
days
and
that
he
would
give
anything
to
be
*NL*
young
again
.
While
he
expressed
these
sentiments
which
bored
us
a
little
*NL*
we
kept
silent
.
Then
he
began
to
talk
of
school
and
of
books
.
He
asked
*NL*
us
whether
we
had
read
the
poetry
of
Thomas
Moore
or
the
works
of
Sir
*NL*
Walter
Scott
and
Lord
Lytton
.
I
pretended
that
I
had
read
every
book
he
*NL*
mentioned
so
that
in
the
end
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
can
see
you
are
a
bookworm
like
myself
.
Now
,
''
he
added
,
pointing
*NL*
to
Mahony
who
was
regarding
us
with
open
eyes
,
``
he
is
different
;
he
goes
*NL*
in
for
games
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
he
had
all
Sir
Walter
Scott
's
works
and
all
Lord
Lytton
's
works
*NL*
at
home
and
never
tired
of
reading
them
.
``
Of
course
,
''
he
said
,
``
there
*NL*
were
some
of
Lord
Lytton
's
works
which
boys
could
n't
read
.
''
Mahony
asked
*NL*
why
could
n't
boys
read
them
--
a
question
which
agitated
and
pained
me
*NL*
because
I
was
afraid
the
man
would
think
I
was
as
stupid
as
Mahony
.
The
*NL*
man
,
however
,
only
smiled
.
I
saw
that
he
had
great
gaps
in
his
mouth
*NL*
between
his
yellow
teeth
.
Then
he
asked
us
which
of
us
had
the
most
*NL*
sweethearts
.
Mahony
mentioned
lightly
that
he
had
three
totties
.
The
man
*NL*
asked
me
how
many
had
I.
I
answered
that
I
had
none
.
He
did
not
believe
*NL*
me
and
said
he
was
sure
I
must
have
one
.
I
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
us
,
''
said
Mahony
pertly
to
the
man
,
``
how
many
have
you
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
smiled
as
before
and
said
that
when
he
was
our
age
he
had
lots
*NL*
of
sweethearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
boy
,
''
he
said
,
``
has
a
little
sweetheart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
attitude
on
this
point
struck
me
as
strangely
liberal
in
a
man
*NL*
of
his
age
.
In
my
heart
I
thought
that
what
he
said
about
boys
and
*NL*
sweethearts
was
reasonable
.
But
I
disliked
the
words
in
his
mouth
and
I
*NL*
wondered
why
he
shivered
once
or
twice
as
if
he
feared
something
or
felt
*NL*
a
sudden
chill
.
As
he
proceeded
I
noticed
that
his
accent
was
good
.
He
*NL*
began
to
speak
to
us
about
girls
,
saying
what
nice
soft
hair
they
had
*NL*
and
how
soft
their
hands
were
and
how
all
girls
were
not
so
good
as
they
*NL*
seemed
to
be
if
one
only
knew
.
There
was
nothing
he
liked
,
he
said
,
so
*NL*
much
as
looking
at
a
nice
young
girl
,
at
her
nice
white
hands
and
her
*NL*
beautiful
soft
hair
.
He
gave
me
the
impression
that
he
was
repeating
*NL*
something
which
he
had
learned
by
heart
or
that
,
magnetised
by
some
*NL*
words
of
his
own
speech
,
his
mind
was
slowly
circling
round
and
round
in
*NL*
the
same
orbit
.
At
times
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
simply
alluding
to
some
*NL*
fact
that
everybody
knew
,
and
at
times
he
lowered
his
voice
and
spoke
*NL*
mysteriously
as
if
he
were
telling
us
something
secret
which
he
did
not
*NL*
wish
others
to
overhear
.
He
repeated
his
phrases
over
and
over
again
,
*NL*
varying
them
and
surrounding
them
with
his
monotonous
voice
.
I
continued
*NL*
to
gaze
towards
the
foot
of
the
slope
,
listening
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
long
while
his
monologue
paused
.
He
stood
up
slowly
,
saying
*NL*
that
he
had
to
leave
us
for
a
minute
or
so
,
a
few
minutes
,
and
,
without
*NL*
changing
the
direction
of
my
gaze
,
I
saw
him
walking
slowly
away
from
us
*NL*
towards
the
near
end
of
the
field
.
We
remained
silent
when
he
had
gone
.
*NL*
After
a
silence
of
a
few
minutes
I
heard
Mahony
exclaim
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
!
Look
what
he
's
doing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
neither
answered
nor
raised
my
eyes
Mahony
exclaimed
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
...
He
's
a
queer
old
josser
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
case
he
asks
us
for
our
names
,
''
I
said
,
``
let
you
be
Murphy
and
I
'll
*NL*
be
Smith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
said
nothing
further
to
each
other
.
I
was
still
considering
whether
*NL*
I
would
go
away
or
not
when
the
man
came
back
and
sat
down
beside
us
*NL*
again
.
Hardly
had
he
sat
down
when
Mahony
,
catching
sight
of
the
cat
*NL*
which
had
escaped
him
,
sprang
up
and
pursued
her
across
the
field
.
The
*NL*
man
and
I
watched
the
chase
.
The
cat
escaped
once
more
and
Mahony
began
*NL*
to
throw
stones
at
the
wall
she
had
escaladed
.
Desisting
from
this
,
he
*NL*
began
to
wander
about
the
far
end
of
the
field
,
aimlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
interval
the
man
spoke
to
me
.
He
said
that
my
friend
was
a
very
*NL*
rough
boy
and
asked
did
he
get
whipped
often
at
school
.
I
was
going
to
*NL*
reply
indignantly
that
we
were
not
National
School
boys
to
be
whipped
,
*NL*
as
he
called
it
;
but
I
remained
silent
.
He
began
to
speak
on
the
subject
*NL*
of
chastising
boys
.
His
mind
,
as
if
magnetised
again
by
his
speech
,
*NL*
seemed
to
circle
slowly
round
and
round
its
new
centre
.
He
said
that
*NL*
when
boys
were
that
kind
they
ought
to
be
whipped
and
well
whipped
.
When
*NL*
a
boy
was
rough
and
unruly
there
was
nothing
would
do
him
any
good
but
a
*NL*
good
sound
whipping
.
A
slap
on
the
hand
or
a
box
on
the
ear
was
no
good
:
*NL*
what
he
wanted
was
to
get
a
nice
warm
whipping
.
I
was
surprised
at
this
*NL*
sentiment
and
involuntarily
glanced
up
at
his
face
.
As
I
did
so
I
met
*NL*
the
gaze
of
a
pair
of
bottle-green
eyes
peering
at
me
from
under
a
*NL*
twitching
forehead
.
I
turned
my
eyes
away
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
continued
his
monologue
.
He
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
recent
*NL*
liberalism
.
He
said
that
if
ever
he
found
a
boy
talking
to
girls
or
*NL*
having
a
girl
for
a
sweetheart
he
would
whip
him
and
whip
him
;
and
that
*NL*
would
teach
him
not
to
be
talking
to
girls
.
And
if
a
boy
had
a
girl
*NL*
for
a
sweetheart
and
told
lies
about
it
then
he
would
give
him
such
*NL*
a
whipping
as
no
boy
ever
got
in
this
world
.
He
said
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
in
this
world
he
would
like
so
well
as
that
.
He
described
to
*NL*
me
how
he
would
whip
such
a
boy
as
if
he
were
unfolding
some
elaborate
*NL*
mystery
.
He
would
love
that
,
he
said
,
better
than
anything
in
this
*NL*
world
;
and
his
voice
,
as
he
led
me
monotonously
through
the
mystery
,
*NL*
grew
almost
affectionate
and
seemed
to
plead
with
me
that
I
should
*NL*
understand
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
till
his
monologue
paused
again
.
Then
I
stood
up
abruptly
.
Lest
*NL*
I
should
betray
my
agitation
I
delayed
a
few
moments
pretending
to
fix
*NL*
my
shoe
properly
and
then
,
saying
that
I
was
obliged
to
go
,
I
bade
him
*NL*
good-day
.
I
went
up
the
slope
calmly
but
my
heart
was
beating
quickly
*NL*
with
fear
that
he
would
seize
me
by
the
ankles
.
When
I
reached
the
top
*NL*
of
the
slope
I
turned
round
and
,
without
looking
at
him
,
called
loudly
*NL*
across
the
field
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Murphy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
voice
had
an
accent
of
forced
bravery
in
it
and
I
was
ashamed
of
my
*NL*
paltry
stratagem
.
I
had
to
call
the
name
again
before
Mahony
saw
me
*NL*
and
hallooed
in
answer
.
How
my
heart
beat
as
he
came
running
across
the
*NL*
field
to
me
!
He
ran
as
if
to
bring
me
aid
.
And
I
was
penitent
;
for
in
my
*NL*
heart
I
had
always
despised
him
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
ARABY
*NL*
*NL*
NORTH
RICHMOND
STREET
,
being
blind
,
was
a
quiet
street
except
at
the
hour
*NL*
when
the
Christian
Brothers
'
School
set
the
boys
free
.
An
uninhabited
*NL*
house
of
two
storeys
stood
at
the
blind
end
,
detached
from
its
*NL*
neighbours
in
a
square
ground
The
other
houses
of
the
street
,
*NL*
conscious
of
decent
lives
within
them
,
gazed
at
one
another
with
brown
*NL*
imperturbable
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
former
tenant
of
our
house
,
a
priest
,
had
died
in
the
back
*NL*
drawing-room
.
Air
,
musty
from
having
been
long
enclosed
,
hung
in
all
*NL*
the
rooms
,
and
the
waste
room
behind
the
kitchen
was
littered
with
old
*NL*
useless
papers
.
Among
these
I
found
a
few
paper-covered
books
,
the
pages
*NL*
of
which
were
curled
and
damp
:
The
Abbot
,
by
Walter
Scott
,
The
Devout
*NL*
Communicant
and
The
Memoirs
of
Vidocq
.
I
liked
the
last
best
because
*NL*
its
leaves
were
yellow
.
The
wild
garden
behind
the
house
contained
a
*NL*
central
apple-tree
and
a
few
straggling
bushes
under
one
of
which
*NL*
I
found
the
late
tenant
's
rusty
bicycle-pump
.
He
had
been
a
very
*NL*
charitable
priest
;
in
his
will
he
had
left
all
his
money
to
institutions
*NL*
and
the
furniture
of
his
house
to
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
short
days
of
winter
came
dusk
fell
before
we
had
well
eaten
*NL*
our
dinners
.
When
we
met
in
the
street
the
houses
had
grown
sombre
.
The
*NL*
space
of
sky
above
us
was
the
colour
of
ever-changing
violet
and
towards
*NL*
it
the
lamps
of
the
street
lifted
their
feeble
lanterns
.
The
cold
air
*NL*
stung
us
and
we
played
till
our
bodies
glowed
.
Our
shouts
echoed
in
the
*NL*
silent
street
.
The
career
of
our
play
brought
us
through
the
dark
muddy
*NL*
lanes
behind
the
houses
where
we
ran
the
gauntlet
of
the
rough
tribes
*NL*
from
the
cottages
,
to
the
back
doors
of
the
dark
dripping
gardens
where
*NL*
odours
arose
from
the
ashpits
,
to
the
dark
odorous
stables
where
a
*NL*
coachman
smoothed
and
combed
the
horse
or
shook
music
from
the
buckled
*NL*
harness
.
When
we
returned
to
the
street
light
from
the
kitchen
windows
*NL*
had
filled
the
areas
.
If
my
uncle
was
seen
turning
the
corner
we
hid
in
*NL*
the
shadow
until
we
had
seen
him
safely
housed
.
Or
if
Mangan
's
sister
*NL*
came
out
on
the
doorstep
to
call
her
brother
in
to
his
tea
we
watched
*NL*
her
from
our
shadow
peer
up
and
down
the
street
.
We
waited
to
see
*NL*
whether
she
would
remain
or
go
in
and
,
if
she
remained
,
we
left
our
*NL*
shadow
and
walked
up
to
Mangan
's
steps
resignedly
.
She
was
waiting
*NL*
for
us
,
her
figure
defined
by
the
light
from
the
half-opened
door
.
Her
*NL*
brother
always
teased
her
before
he
obeyed
and
I
stood
by
the
railings
*NL*
looking
at
her
.
Her
dress
swung
as
she
moved
her
body
and
the
soft
rope
*NL*
of
her
hair
tossed
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
I
lay
on
the
floor
in
the
front
parlour
watching
her
door
.
*NL*
The
blind
was
pulled
down
to
within
an
inch
of
the
sash
so
that
I
could
*NL*
not
be
seen
.
When
she
came
out
on
the
doorstep
my
heart
leaped
.
I
ran
*NL*
to
the
hall
,
seized
my
books
and
followed
her
.
I
kept
her
brown
figure
*NL*
always
in
my
eye
and
,
when
we
came
near
the
point
at
which
our
ways
*NL*
diverged
,
I
quickened
my
pace
and
passed
her
.
This
happened
morning
*NL*
after
morning
.
I
had
never
spoken
to
her
,
except
for
a
few
casual
words
,
*NL*
and
yet
her
name
was
like
a
summons
to
all
my
foolish
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
image
accompanied
me
even
in
places
the
most
hostile
to
romance
.
On
*NL*
Saturday
evenings
when
my
aunt
went
marketing
I
had
to
go
to
carry
*NL*
some
of
the
parcels
.
We
walked
through
the
flaring
streets
,
jostled
*NL*
by
drunken
men
and
bargaining
women
,
amid
the
curses
of
labourers
,
the
*NL*
shrill
litanies
of
shop-boys
who
stood
on
guard
by
the
barrels
of
pigs
'
*NL*
cheeks
,
the
nasal
chanting
of
street-singers
,
who
sang
a
come-all-you
*NL*
about
O'Donovan
Rossa
,
or
a
ballad
about
the
troubles
in
our
native
*NL*
land
.
These
noises
converged
in
a
single
sensation
of
life
for
me
:
I
*NL*
imagined
that
I
bore
my
chalice
safely
through
a
throng
of
foes
.
Her
*NL*
name
sprang
to
my
lips
at
moments
in
strange
prayers
and
praises
which
I
*NL*
myself
did
not
understand
.
My
eyes
were
often
full
of
tears
-LRB-
I
could
not
*NL*
tell
why
-RRB-
and
at
times
a
flood
from
my
heart
seemed
to
pour
itself
out
*NL*
into
my
bosom
.
I
thought
little
of
the
future
.
I
did
not
know
whether
I
*NL*
would
ever
speak
to
her
or
not
or
,
if
I
spoke
to
her
,
how
I
could
tell
*NL*
her
of
my
confused
adoration
.
But
my
body
was
like
a
harp
and
her
words
*NL*
and
gestures
were
like
fingers
running
upon
the
wires
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
I
went
into
the
back
drawing-room
in
which
the
priest
had
*NL*
died
.
It
was
a
dark
rainy
evening
and
there
was
no
sound
in
the
house
.
*NL*
Through
one
of
the
broken
panes
I
heard
the
rain
impinge
upon
the
earth
,
*NL*
the
fine
incessant
needles
of
water
playing
in
the
sodden
beds
.
Some
*NL*
distant
lamp
or
lighted
window
gleamed
below
me
.
I
was
thankful
that
I
*NL*
could
see
so
little
.
All
my
senses
seemed
to
desire
to
veil
themselves
*NL*
and
,
feeling
that
I
was
about
to
slip
from
them
,
I
pressed
the
palms
of
*NL*
my
hands
together
until
they
trembled
,
murmuring
:
``
O
love
!
O
love
!
''
many
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
she
spoke
to
me
.
When
she
addressed
the
first
words
to
me
I
was
*NL*
so
confused
that
I
did
not
know
what
to
answer
.
She
asked
me
was
I
going
*NL*
to
Araby
.
I
forgot
whether
I
answered
yes
or
no
.
It
would
be
a
splendid
*NL*
bazaar
,
she
said
;
s
she
would
love
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
ca
n't
you
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
spoke
she
turned
a
silver
bracelet
round
and
round
her
wrist
.
*NL*
She
could
not
go
,
she
said
,
because
there
would
be
a
retreat
that
week
*NL*
in
her
convent
.
Her
brother
and
two
other
boys
were
fighting
for
their
*NL*
caps
and
I
was
alone
at
the
railings
.
She
held
one
of
the
spikes
,
bowing
*NL*
her
head
towards
me
.
The
light
from
the
lamp
opposite
our
door
caught
*NL*
the
white
curve
of
her
neck
,
lit
up
her
hair
that
rested
there
and
,
*NL*
falling
,
lit
up
the
hand
upon
the
railing
.
It
fell
over
one
side
of
her
*NL*
dress
and
caught
the
white
border
of
a
petticoat
,
just
visible
as
she
*NL*
stood
at
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
well
for
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
go
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
will
bring
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
innumerable
follies
laid
waste
my
waking
and
sleeping
thoughts
*NL*
after
that
evening
!
I
wished
to
annihilate
the
tedious
intervening
days
.
*NL*
I
chafed
against
the
work
of
school
.
At
night
in
my
bedroom
and
by
day
*NL*
in
the
classroom
her
image
came
between
me
and
the
page
I
strove
to
*NL*
read
.
The
syllables
of
the
word
Araby
were
called
to
me
through
the
*NL*
silence
in
which
my
soul
luxuriated
and
cast
an
Eastern
enchantment
over
*NL*
me
.
I
asked
for
leave
to
go
to
the
bazaar
on
Saturday
night
.
My
aunt
*NL*
was
surprised
and
hoped
it
was
not
some
Freemason
affair
.
I
answered
few
*NL*
questions
in
class
.
I
watched
my
master
's
face
pass
from
amiability
to
*NL*
sternness
;
he
hoped
I
was
not
beginning
to
idle
.
I
could
not
call
my
*NL*
wandering
thoughts
together
.
I
had
hardly
any
patience
with
the
serious
*NL*
work
of
life
which
,
now
that
it
stood
between
me
and
my
desire
,
seemed
*NL*
to
me
child
's
play
,
ugly
monotonous
child
's
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
morning
I
reminded
my
uncle
that
I
wished
to
go
to
the
*NL*
bazaar
in
the
evening
.
He
was
fussing
at
the
hallstand
,
looking
for
the
*NL*
hat-brush
,
and
answered
me
curtly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
boy
,
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
in
the
hall
I
could
not
go
into
the
front
parlour
and
lie
at
*NL*
the
window
.
I
left
the
house
in
bad
humour
and
walked
slowly
towards
the
*NL*
school
.
The
air
was
pitilessly
raw
and
already
my
heart
misgave
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
home
to
dinner
my
uncle
had
not
yet
been
home
.
Still
it
was
*NL*
early
.
I
sat
staring
at
the
clock
for
some
time
and
,
when
its
ticking
*NL*
began
to
irritate
me
,
I
left
the
room
.
I
mounted
the
staircase
and
*NL*
gained
the
upper
part
of
the
house
.
The
high
cold
empty
gloomy
rooms
*NL*
liberated
me
and
I
went
from
room
to
room
singing
.
From
the
front
window
*NL*
I
saw
my
companions
playing
below
in
the
street
.
Their
cries
reached
me
*NL*
weakened
and
indistinct
and
,
leaning
my
forehead
against
the
cool
glass
,
*NL*
I
looked
over
at
the
dark
house
where
she
lived
.
I
may
have
stood
*NL*
there
for
an
hour
,
seeing
nothing
but
the
brown-clad
figure
cast
by
my
*NL*
imagination
,
touched
discreetly
by
the
lamplight
at
the
curved
neck
,
at
*NL*
the
hand
upon
the
railings
and
at
the
border
below
the
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
downstairs
again
I
found
Mrs.
Mercer
sitting
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
She
was
an
old
garrulous
woman
,
a
pawnbroker
's
widow
,
who
collected
*NL*
used
stamps
for
some
pious
purpose
.
I
had
to
endure
the
gossip
of
the
*NL*
tea-table
.
The
meal
was
prolonged
beyond
an
hour
and
still
my
uncle
did
*NL*
not
come
.
Mrs.
Mercer
stood
up
to
go
:
she
was
sorry
she
could
n't
wait
*NL*
any
longer
,
but
it
was
after
eight
o'clock
and
she
did
not
like
to
be
*NL*
out
late
as
the
night
air
was
bad
for
her
.
When
she
had
gone
I
began
to
*NL*
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
clenching
my
fists
.
My
aunt
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
you
may
put
off
your
bazaar
for
this
night
of
Our
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
I
heard
my
uncle
's
latchkey
in
the
halldoor
.
I
heard
him
*NL*
talking
to
himself
and
heard
the
hallstand
rocking
when
it
had
received
*NL*
the
weight
of
his
overcoat
.
I
could
interpret
these
signs
.
When
he
was
*NL*
midway
through
his
dinner
I
asked
him
to
give
me
the
money
to
go
to
the
*NL*
bazaar
.
He
had
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
people
are
in
bed
and
after
their
first
sleep
now
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
smile
.
My
aunt
said
to
him
energetically
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
give
him
the
money
and
let
him
go
?
You
've
kept
him
late
*NL*
enough
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
said
he
was
very
sorry
he
had
forgotten
.
He
said
he
believed
in
*NL*
the
old
saying
:
``
All
work
and
no
play
makes
Jack
a
dull
boy
.
''
He
asked
*NL*
me
where
I
was
going
and
,
when
I
had
told
him
a
second
time
he
asked
me
*NL*
did
I
know
The
Arab
's
Farewell
to
his
Steed
.
When
I
left
the
kitchen
he
*NL*
was
about
to
recite
the
opening
lines
of
the
piece
to
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
held
a
florin
tightly
in
my
hand
as
I
strode
down
Buckingham
Street
*NL*
towards
the
station
.
The
sight
of
the
streets
thronged
with
buyers
and
*NL*
glaring
with
gas
recalled
to
me
the
purpose
of
my
journey
.
I
took
my
*NL*
seat
in
a
third-class
carriage
of
a
deserted
train
.
After
an
intolerable
*NL*
delay
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
slowly
.
It
crept
onward
among
*NL*
ruinous
houses
and
over
the
twinkling
river
.
At
Westland
Row
Station
a
*NL*
crowd
of
people
pressed
to
the
carriage
doors
;
but
the
porters
moved
*NL*
them
back
,
saying
that
it
was
a
special
train
for
the
bazaar
.
I
remained
*NL*
alone
in
the
bare
carriage
.
In
a
few
minutes
the
train
drew
up
beside
an
*NL*
improvised
wooden
platform
.
I
passed
out
on
to
the
road
and
saw
by
the
*NL*
lighted
dial
of
a
clock
that
it
was
ten
minutes
to
ten
.
In
front
of
me
*NL*
was
a
large
building
which
displayed
the
magical
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
find
any
sixpenny
entrance
and
,
fearing
that
the
bazaar
*NL*
would
be
closed
,
I
passed
in
quickly
through
a
turnstile
,
handing
a
*NL*
shilling
to
a
weary-looking
man
.
I
found
myself
in
a
big
hall
girdled
at
*NL*
half
its
height
by
a
gallery
.
Nearly
all
the
stalls
were
closed
and
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
the
hall
was
in
darkness
.
I
recognised
a
silence
like
*NL*
that
which
pervades
a
church
after
a
service
.
I
walked
into
the
centre
*NL*
of
the
bazaar
timidly
.
A
few
people
were
gathered
about
the
stalls
which
*NL*
were
still
open
.
Before
a
curtain
,
over
which
the
words
Cafe
Chantant
*NL*
were
written
in
coloured
lamps
,
two
men
were
counting
money
on
a
salver
.
*NL*
I
listened
to
the
fall
of
the
coins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Remembering
with
difficulty
why
I
had
come
I
went
over
to
one
of
the
*NL*
stalls
and
examined
porcelain
vases
and
flowered
tea-sets
.
At
the
*NL*
door
of
the
stall
a
young
lady
was
talking
and
laughing
with
two
young
*NL*
gentlemen
.
I
remarked
their
English
accents
and
listened
vaguely
to
*NL*
their
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
never
said
such
a
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
but
you
did
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
but
I
did
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
she
say
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
heard
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
there
's
a.
.
.
fib
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Observing
me
the
young
lady
came
over
and
asked
me
did
I
wish
to
buy
*NL*
anything
.
The
tone
of
her
voice
was
not
encouraging
;
she
seemed
to
have
*NL*
spoken
to
me
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
.
I
looked
humbly
at
the
great
jars
*NL*
that
stood
like
eastern
guards
at
either
side
of
the
dark
entrance
to
*NL*
the
stall
and
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
changed
the
position
of
one
of
the
vases
and
went
back
to
*NL*
the
two
young
men
.
They
began
to
talk
of
the
same
subject
.
Once
or
twice
*NL*
the
young
lady
glanced
at
me
over
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lingered
before
her
stall
,
though
I
knew
my
stay
was
useless
,
to
make
*NL*
my
interest
in
her
wares
seem
the
more
real
.
Then
I
turned
away
slowly
*NL*
and
walked
down
the
middle
of
the
bazaar
.
I
allowed
the
two
pennies
to
*NL*
fall
against
the
sixpence
in
my
pocket
.
I
heard
a
voice
call
from
one
*NL*
end
of
the
gallery
that
the
light
was
out
.
The
upper
part
of
the
hall
*NL*
was
now
completely
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gazing
up
into
the
darkness
I
saw
myself
as
a
creature
driven
and
*NL*
derided
by
vanity
;
and
my
eyes
burned
with
anguish
and
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
EVELINE
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
sat
at
the
window
watching
the
evening
invade
the
avenue
.
Her
head
*NL*
was
leaned
against
the
window
curtains
and
in
her
nostrils
was
the
odour
*NL*
of
dusty
cretonne
.
She
was
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Few
people
passed
.
The
man
out
of
the
last
house
passed
on
his
way
*NL*
home
;
she
heard
his
footsteps
clacking
along
the
concrete
pavement
and
*NL*
afterwards
crunching
on
the
cinder
path
before
the
new
red
houses
.
One
*NL*
time
there
used
to
be
a
field
there
in
which
they
used
to
play
every
*NL*
evening
with
other
people
's
children
.
Then
a
man
from
Belfast
bought
*NL*
the
field
and
built
houses
in
it
--
not
like
their
little
brown
houses
but
*NL*
bright
brick
houses
with
shining
roofs
.
The
children
of
the
avenue
used
*NL*
to
play
together
in
that
field
--
the
Devines
,
the
Waters
,
the
Dunns
,
*NL*
little
Keogh
the
cripple
,
she
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
.
Ernest
,
*NL*
however
,
never
played
:
he
was
too
grown
up
.
Her
father
used
often
to
*NL*
hunt
them
in
out
of
the
field
with
his
blackthorn
stick
;
but
usually
*NL*
little
Keogh
used
to
keep
nix
and
call
out
when
he
saw
her
father
*NL*
coming
.
Still
they
seemed
to
have
been
rather
happy
then
.
Her
father
was
*NL*
not
so
bad
then
;
and
besides
,
her
mother
was
alive
.
That
was
a
long
time
*NL*
ago
;
she
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
were
all
grown
up
;
her
mother
*NL*
was
dead
.
Tizzie
Dunn
was
dead
,
too
,
and
the
Waters
had
gone
back
to
*NL*
England
.
Everything
changes
.
Now
she
was
going
to
go
away
like
the
*NL*
others
,
to
leave
her
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Home
!
She
looked
round
the
room
,
reviewing
all
its
familiar
objects
*NL*
which
she
had
dusted
once
a
week
for
so
many
years
,
wondering
where
on
*NL*
earth
all
the
dust
came
from
.
Perhaps
she
would
never
see
again
those
*NL*
familiar
objects
from
which
she
had
never
dreamed
of
being
divided
.
*NL*
And
yet
during
all
those
years
she
had
never
found
out
the
name
of
the
*NL*
priest
whose
yellowing
photograph
hung
on
the
wall
above
the
broken
*NL*
harmonium
beside
the
coloured
print
of
the
promises
made
to
Blessed
*NL*
Margaret
Mary
Alacoque
.
He
had
been
a
school
friend
of
her
father
.
*NL*
Whenever
he
showed
the
photograph
to
a
visitor
her
father
used
to
pass
*NL*
it
with
a
casual
word
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
in
Melbourne
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
consented
to
go
away
,
to
leave
her
home
.
Was
that
wise
?
She
*NL*
tried
to
weigh
each
side
of
the
question
.
In
her
home
anyway
she
had
*NL*
shelter
and
food
;
she
had
those
whom
she
had
known
all
her
life
about
*NL*
her
.
Of
course
she
had
to
work
hard
,
both
in
the
house
and
at
business
.
*NL*
What
would
they
say
of
her
in
the
Stores
when
they
found
out
that
she
*NL*
had
run
away
with
a
fellow
?
Say
she
was
a
fool
,
perhaps
;
and
her
place
*NL*
would
be
filled
up
by
advertisement
.
Miss
Gavan
would
be
glad
.
She
*NL*
had
always
had
an
edge
on
her
,
especially
whenever
there
were
people
*NL*
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Hill
,
do
n't
you
see
these
ladies
are
waiting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
lively
,
Miss
Hill
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
not
cry
many
tears
at
leaving
the
Stores
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
her
new
home
,
in
a
distant
unknown
country
,
it
would
not
be
like
*NL*
that
.
Then
she
would
be
married
--
she
,
Eveline
.
People
would
treat
her
*NL*
with
respect
then
.
She
would
not
be
treated
as
her
mother
had
been
.
Even
*NL*
now
,
though
she
was
over
nineteen
,
she
sometimes
felt
herself
in
danger
*NL*
of
her
father
's
violence
.
She
knew
it
was
that
that
had
given
her
the
*NL*
palpitations
.
When
they
were
growing
up
he
had
never
gone
for
her
like
*NL*
he
used
to
go
for
Harry
and
Ernest
,
because
she
was
a
girl
;
but
latterly
*NL*
he
had
begun
to
threaten
her
and
say
what
he
would
do
to
her
only
for
*NL*
her
dead
mother
's
sake
.
And
now
she
had
nobody
to
protect
her
.
Ernest
was
*NL*
dead
and
Harry
,
who
was
in
the
church
decorating
business
,
was
nearly
*NL*
always
down
somewhere
in
the
country
.
Besides
,
the
invariable
squabble
*NL*
for
money
on
Saturday
nights
had
begun
to
weary
her
unspeakably
.
She
*NL*
always
gave
her
entire
wages
--
seven
shillings
--
and
Harry
always
sent
up
*NL*
what
he
could
but
the
trouble
was
to
get
any
money
from
her
father
.
*NL*
He
said
she
used
to
squander
the
money
,
that
she
had
no
head
,
that
*NL*
he
was
n't
going
to
give
her
his
hard-earned
money
to
throw
about
the
*NL*
streets
,
and
much
more
,
for
he
was
usually
fairly
bad
of
a
Saturday
night
.
*NL*
In
the
end
he
would
give
her
the
money
and
ask
her
had
she
any
intention
*NL*
of
buying
Sunday
's
dinner
.
Then
she
had
to
rush
out
as
quickly
as
she
*NL*
could
and
do
her
marketing
,
holding
her
black
leather
purse
tightly
in
*NL*
her
hand
as
she
elbowed
her
way
through
the
crowds
and
returning
home
*NL*
late
under
her
load
of
provisions
.
She
had
hard
work
to
keep
the
house
*NL*
together
and
to
see
that
the
two
young
children
who
had
been
left
to
her
*NL*
charge
went
to
school
regularly
and
got
their
meals
regularly
.
It
was
*NL*
hard
work
--
a
hard
life
--
but
now
that
she
was
about
to
leave
it
she
did
*NL*
not
find
it
a
wholly
undesirable
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
about
to
explore
another
life
with
Frank
.
Frank
was
very
kind
,
*NL*
manly
,
open-hearted
.
She
was
to
go
away
with
him
by
the
night-boat
to
*NL*
be
his
wife
and
to
live
with
him
in
Buenos
Ayres
where
he
had
a
home
*NL*
waiting
for
her
.
How
well
she
remembered
the
first
time
she
had
seen
*NL*
him
;
he
was
lodging
in
a
house
on
the
main
road
where
she
used
to
visit
.
*NL*
It
seemed
a
few
weeks
ago
.
He
was
standing
at
the
gate
,
his
peaked
cap
*NL*
pushed
back
on
his
head
and
his
hair
tumbled
forward
over
a
face
of
*NL*
bronze
.
Then
they
had
come
to
know
each
other
.
He
used
to
meet
her
*NL*
outside
the
Stores
every
evening
and
see
her
home
.
He
took
her
to
see
*NL*
The
Bohemian
Girl
and
she
felt
elated
as
she
sat
in
an
unaccustomed
part
*NL*
of
the
theatre
with
him
.
He
was
awfully
fond
of
music
and
sang
a
little
.
*NL*
People
knew
that
they
were
courting
and
,
when
he
sang
about
the
lass
*NL*
that
loves
a
sailor
,
she
always
felt
pleasantly
confused
.
He
used
to
*NL*
call
her
Poppens
out
of
fun
.
First
of
all
it
had
been
an
excitement
for
*NL*
her
to
have
a
fellow
and
then
she
had
begun
to
like
him
.
He
had
tales
of
*NL*
distant
countries
.
He
had
started
as
a
deck
boy
at
a
pound
a
month
on
a
*NL*
ship
of
the
Allan
Line
going
out
to
Canada
.
He
told
her
the
names
of
*NL*
the
ships
he
had
been
on
and
the
names
of
the
different
services
.
He
had
*NL*
sailed
through
the
Straits
of
Magellan
and
he
told
her
stories
of
the
*NL*
terrible
Patagonians
.
He
had
fallen
on
his
feet
in
Buenos
Ayres
,
he
*NL*
said
,
and
had
come
over
to
the
old
country
just
for
a
holiday
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
her
father
had
found
out
the
affair
and
had
forbidden
her
to
*NL*
have
anything
to
say
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
these
sailor
chaps
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
had
quarrelled
with
Frank
and
after
that
she
had
to
meet
her
*NL*
lover
secretly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
deepened
in
the
avenue
.
The
white
of
two
letters
in
her
lap
*NL*
grew
indistinct
.
One
was
to
Harry
;
the
other
was
to
her
father
.
Ernest
*NL*
had
been
her
favourite
but
she
liked
Harry
too
.
Her
father
was
becoming
*NL*
old
lately
,
she
noticed
;
he
would
miss
her
.
Sometimes
he
could
be
very
*NL*
nice
.
Not
long
before
,
when
she
had
been
laid
up
for
a
day
,
he
had
read
*NL*
her
out
a
ghost
story
and
made
toast
for
her
at
the
fire
.
Another
day
,
*NL*
when
their
mother
was
alive
,
they
had
all
gone
for
a
picnic
to
the
Hill
*NL*
of
Howth
.
She
remembered
her
father
putting
on
her
mother
's
bonnet
to
*NL*
make
the
children
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
time
was
running
out
but
she
continued
to
sit
by
the
window
,
*NL*
leaning
her
head
against
the
window
curtain
,
inhaling
the
odour
of
dusty
*NL*
cretonne
.
Down
far
in
the
avenue
she
could
hear
a
street
organ
playing
.
*NL*
She
knew
the
air
.
Strange
that
it
should
come
that
very
night
to
remind
*NL*
her
of
the
promise
to
her
mother
,
her
promise
to
keep
the
home
together
*NL*
as
long
as
she
could
.
She
remembered
the
last
night
of
her
mother
's
*NL*
illness
;
she
was
again
in
the
close
dark
room
at
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
hall
and
outside
she
heard
a
melancholy
air
of
Italy
.
The
organ-player
*NL*
had
been
ordered
to
go
away
and
given
sixpence
.
She
remembered
her
*NL*
father
strutting
back
into
the
sickroom
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damned
Italians
!
coming
over
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
mused
the
pitiful
vision
of
her
mother
's
life
laid
its
spell
on
*NL*
the
very
quick
of
her
being
--
that
life
of
commonplace
sacrifices
closing
*NL*
in
final
craziness
.
She
trembled
as
she
heard
again
her
mother
's
voice
*NL*
saying
constantly
with
foolish
insistence
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Derevaun
Seraun
!
Derevaun
Seraun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
up
in
a
sudden
impulse
of
terror
.
Escape
!
She
must
escape
!
*NL*
Frank
would
save
her
.
He
would
give
her
life
,
perhaps
love
,
too
.
But
she
*NL*
wanted
to
live
.
Why
should
she
be
unhappy
?
She
had
a
right
to
happiness
.
*NL*
Frank
would
take
her
in
his
arms
,
fold
her
in
his
arms
.
He
would
save
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
among
the
swaying
crowd
in
the
station
at
the
North
Wall
.
He
*NL*
held
her
hand
and
she
knew
that
he
was
speaking
to
her
,
saying
something
*NL*
about
the
passage
over
and
over
again
.
The
station
was
full
of
soldiers
*NL*
with
brown
baggages
.
Through
the
wide
doors
of
the
sheds
she
caught
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
the
black
mass
of
the
boat
,
lying
in
beside
the
quay
wall
,
*NL*
with
illumined
portholes
.
She
answered
nothing
.
She
felt
her
cheek
pale
*NL*
and
cold
and
,
out
of
a
maze
of
distress
,
she
prayed
to
God
to
direct
*NL*
her
,
to
show
her
what
was
her
duty
.
The
boat
blew
a
long
mournful
*NL*
whistle
into
the
mist
.
If
she
went
,
tomorrow
she
would
be
on
the
sea
*NL*
with
Frank
,
steaming
towards
Buenos
Ayres
.
Their
passage
had
been
*NL*
booked
.
Could
she
still
draw
back
after
all
he
had
done
for
her
?
Her
*NL*
distress
awoke
a
nausea
in
her
body
and
she
kept
moving
her
lips
in
*NL*
silent
fervent
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
bell
clanged
upon
her
heart
.
She
felt
him
seize
her
hand
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
seas
of
the
world
tumbled
about
her
heart
.
He
was
drawing
her
*NL*
into
them
:
he
would
drown
her
.
She
gripped
with
both
hands
at
the
iron
*NL*
railing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
!
No
!
No
!
It
was
impossible
.
Her
hands
clutched
the
iron
in
frenzy
.
*NL*
Amid
the
seas
she
sent
a
cry
of
anguish
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eveline
!
Evvy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rushed
beyond
the
barrier
and
called
to
her
to
follow
.
He
was
shouted
*NL*
at
to
go
on
but
he
still
called
to
her
.
She
set
her
white
face
to
him
,
*NL*
passive
,
like
a
helpless
animal
.
Her
eyes
gave
him
no
sign
of
love
or
*NL*
farewell
or
recognition
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AFTER
THE
RACE
*NL*
*NL*
THE
cars
came
scudding
in
towards
Dublin
,
running
evenly
like
pellets
*NL*
in
the
groove
of
the
Naas
Road
.
At
the
crest
of
the
hill
at
Inchicore
*NL*
sightseers
had
gathered
in
clumps
to
watch
the
cars
careering
homeward
*NL*
and
through
this
channel
of
poverty
and
inaction
the
Continent
sped
its
*NL*
wealth
and
industry
.
Now
and
again
the
clumps
of
people
raised
the
cheer
*NL*
of
the
gratefully
oppressed
.
Their
sympathy
,
however
,
was
for
the
blue
*NL*
cars
--
the
cars
of
their
friends
,
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
,
moreover
,
were
virtual
victors
.
Their
team
had
finished
*NL*
solidly
;
they
had
been
placed
second
and
third
and
the
driver
of
the
*NL*
winning
German
car
was
reported
a
Belgian
.
Each
blue
car
,
therefore
,
*NL*
received
a
double
measure
of
welcome
as
it
topped
the
crest
of
the
hill
*NL*
and
each
cheer
of
welcome
was
acknowledged
with
smiles
and
nods
by
those
*NL*
in
the
car
.
In
one
of
these
trimly
built
cars
was
a
party
of
four
*NL*
young
men
whose
spirits
seemed
to
be
at
present
well
above
the
level
*NL*
of
successful
Gallicism
:
in
fact
,
these
four
young
men
were
almost
*NL*
hilarious
.
They
were
Charles
Segouin
,
the
owner
of
the
car
;
Andre
*NL*
Riviere
,
a
young
electrician
of
Canadian
birth
;
a
huge
Hungarian
named
*NL*
Villona
and
a
neatly
groomed
young
man
named
Doyle
.
Segouin
was
in
good
*NL*
humour
because
he
had
unexpectedly
received
some
orders
in
advance
-LRB-
he
*NL*
was
about
to
start
a
motor
establishment
in
Paris
-RRB-
and
Riviere
was
in
*NL*
good
humour
because
he
was
to
be
appointed
manager
of
the
establishment
;
*NL*
these
two
young
men
-LRB-
who
were
cousins
-RRB-
were
also
in
good
humour
because
*NL*
of
the
success
of
the
French
cars
.
Villona
was
in
good
humour
because
he
*NL*
had
had
a
very
satisfactory
luncheon
;
and
besides
he
was
an
optimist
by
*NL*
nature
.
The
fourth
member
of
the
party
,
however
,
was
too
excited
to
be
*NL*
genuinely
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
about
twenty-six
years
of
age
,
with
a
soft
,
light
brown
moustache
*NL*
and
rather
innocent-looking
grey
eyes
.
His
father
,
who
had
begun
life
as
*NL*
an
advanced
Nationalist
,
had
modified
his
views
early
.
He
had
made
his
*NL*
money
as
a
butcher
in
Kingstown
and
by
opening
shops
in
Dublin
and
in
*NL*
the
suburbs
he
had
made
his
money
many
times
over
.
He
had
also
been
*NL*
fortunate
enough
to
secure
some
of
the
police
contracts
and
in
the
end
*NL*
he
had
become
rich
enough
to
be
alluded
to
in
the
Dublin
newspapers
as
a
*NL*
merchant
prince
.
He
had
sent
his
son
to
England
to
be
educated
in
a
big
*NL*
Catholic
college
and
had
afterwards
sent
him
to
Dublin
University
to
*NL*
study
law
.
Jimmy
did
not
study
very
earnestly
and
took
to
bad
courses
*NL*
for
a
while
.
He
had
money
and
he
was
popular
;
and
he
divided
his
time
*NL*
curiously
between
musical
and
motoring
circles
.
Then
he
had
been
sent
*NL*
for
a
term
to
Cambridge
to
see
a
little
life
.
His
father
,
remonstrative
,
*NL*
but
covertly
proud
of
the
excess
,
had
paid
his
bills
and
brought
him
*NL*
home
.
It
was
at
Cambridge
that
he
had
met
Segouin
.
They
were
not
much
*NL*
more
than
acquaintances
as
yet
but
Jimmy
found
great
pleasure
in
the
*NL*
society
of
one
who
had
seen
so
much
of
the
world
and
was
reputed
to
*NL*
own
some
of
the
biggest
hotels
in
France
.
Such
a
person
-LRB-
as
his
father
*NL*
agreed
-RRB-
was
well
worth
knowing
,
even
if
he
had
not
been
the
charming
*NL*
companion
he
was
.
Villona
was
entertaining
also
--
a
brilliant
*NL*
pianist
--
but
,
unfortunately
,
very
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
car
ran
on
merrily
with
its
cargo
of
hilarious
youth
.
The
two
*NL*
cousins
sat
on
the
front
seat
;
Jimmy
and
his
Hungarian
friend
sat
*NL*
behind
.
Decidedly
Villona
was
in
excellent
spirits
;
he
kept
up
a
deep
*NL*
bass
hum
of
melody
for
miles
of
the
road
.
The
Frenchmen
flung
their
*NL*
laughter
and
light
words
over
their
shoulders
and
often
Jimmy
had
*NL*
to
strain
forward
to
catch
the
quick
phrase
.
This
was
not
altogether
*NL*
pleasant
for
him
,
as
he
had
nearly
always
to
make
a
deft
guess
at
the
*NL*
meaning
and
shout
back
a
suitable
answer
in
the
face
of
a
high
wind
.
*NL*
Besides
Villona
's
humming
would
confuse
anybody
;
the
noise
of
the
car
,
*NL*
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rapid
motion
through
space
elates
one
;
so
does
notoriety
;
so
does
*NL*
the
possession
of
money
.
These
were
three
good
reasons
for
Jimmy
's
*NL*
excitement
.
He
had
been
seen
by
many
of
his
friends
that
day
in
the
*NL*
company
of
these
Continentals
.
At
the
control
Segouin
had
presented
him
*NL*
to
one
of
the
French
competitors
and
,
in
answer
to
his
confused
murmur
*NL*
of
compliment
,
the
swarthy
face
of
the
driver
had
disclosed
a
line
of
*NL*
shining
white
teeth
.
It
was
pleasant
after
that
honour
to
return
to
the
*NL*
profane
world
of
spectators
amid
nudges
and
significant
looks
.
Then
as
*NL*
to
money
--
he
really
had
a
great
sum
under
his
control
.
Segouin
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
would
not
think
it
a
great
sum
but
Jimmy
who
,
in
spite
of
temporary
*NL*
errors
,
was
at
heart
the
inheritor
of
solid
instincts
knew
well
with
*NL*
what
difficulty
it
had
been
got
together
.
This
knowledge
had
previously
*NL*
kept
his
bills
within
the
limits
of
reasonable
recklessness
,
and
,
if
he
*NL*
had
been
so
conscious
of
the
labour
latent
in
money
when
there
had
been
*NL*
question
merely
of
some
freak
of
the
higher
intelligence
,
how
much
more
*NL*
so
now
when
he
was
about
to
stake
the
greater
part
of
his
substance
!
It
*NL*
was
a
serious
thing
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
the
investment
was
a
good
one
and
Segouin
had
managed
to
give
*NL*
the
impression
that
it
was
by
a
favour
of
friendship
the
mite
of
Irish
*NL*
money
was
to
be
included
in
the
capital
of
the
concern
.
Jimmy
had
a
*NL*
respect
for
his
father
's
shrewdness
in
business
matters
and
in
this
case
*NL*
it
had
been
his
father
who
had
first
suggested
the
investment
;
money
to
*NL*
be
made
in
the
motor
business
,
pots
of
money
.
Moreover
Segouin
had
the
*NL*
unmistakable
air
of
wealth
.
Jimmy
set
out
to
translate
into
days
'
work
*NL*
that
lordly
car
in
which
he
sat
.
How
smoothly
it
ran
.
In
what
style
they
*NL*
had
come
careering
along
the
country
roads
!
The
journey
laid
a
magical
*NL*
finger
on
the
genuine
pulse
of
life
and
gallantly
the
machinery
of
human
*NL*
nerves
strove
to
answer
the
bounding
courses
of
the
swift
blue
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
down
Dame
Street
.
The
street
was
busy
with
unusual
*NL*
traffic
,
loud
with
the
horns
of
motorists
and
the
gongs
of
impatient
*NL*
tram-drivers
.
Near
the
Bank
Segouin
drew
up
and
Jimmy
and
his
friend
*NL*
alighted
.
A
little
knot
of
people
collected
on
the
footpath
to
pay
*NL*
homage
to
the
snorting
motor
.
The
party
was
to
dine
together
that
*NL*
evening
in
Segouin
's
hotel
and
,
meanwhile
,
Jimmy
and
his
friend
,
who
was
*NL*
staying
with
him
,
were
to
go
home
to
dress
.
The
car
steered
out
slowly
*NL*
for
Grafton
Street
while
the
two
young
men
pushed
their
way
through
*NL*
the
knot
of
gazers
.
They
walked
northward
with
a
curious
feeling
of
*NL*
disappointment
in
the
exercise
,
while
the
city
hung
its
pale
globes
of
*NL*
light
above
them
in
a
haze
of
summer
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Jimmy
's
house
this
dinner
had
been
pronounced
an
occasion
.
A
certain
*NL*
pride
mingled
with
his
parents
'
trepidation
,
a
certain
eagerness
,
also
,
*NL*
to
play
fast
and
loose
for
the
names
of
great
foreign
cities
have
at
*NL*
least
this
virtue
.
Jimmy
,
too
,
looked
very
well
when
he
was
dressed
and
,
*NL*
as
he
stood
in
the
hall
giving
a
last
equation
to
the
bows
of
his
dress
*NL*
tie
,
his
father
may
have
felt
even
commercially
satisfied
at
having
*NL*
secured
for
his
son
qualities
often
unpurchaseable
.
His
father
,
*NL*
therefore
,
was
unusually
friendly
with
Villona
and
his
manner
expressed
*NL*
a
real
respect
for
foreign
accomplishments
;
but
this
subtlety
of
his
*NL*
host
was
probably
lost
upon
the
Hungarian
,
who
was
beginning
to
have
a
*NL*
sharp
desire
for
his
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
excellent
,
exquisite
.
Segouin
,
Jimmy
decided
,
had
a
very
*NL*
refined
taste
.
The
party
was
increased
by
a
young
Englishman
named
Routh
*NL*
whom
Jimmy
had
seen
with
Segouin
at
Cambridge
.
The
young
men
supped
in
*NL*
a
snug
room
lit
by
electric
candle-lamps
.
They
talked
volubly
and
with
*NL*
little
reserve
.
Jimmy
,
whose
imagination
was
kindling
,
conceived
the
*NL*
lively
youth
of
the
Frenchmen
twined
elegantly
upon
the
firm
framework
*NL*
of
the
Englishman
's
manner
.
A
graceful
image
of
his
,
he
thought
,
and
a
*NL*
just
one
.
He
admired
the
dexterity
with
which
their
host
directed
the
*NL*
conversation
.
The
five
young
men
had
various
tastes
and
their
tongues
*NL*
had
been
loosened
.
Villona
,
with
immense
respect
,
began
to
discover
to
*NL*
the
mildly
surprised
Englishman
the
beauties
of
the
English
madrigal
,
*NL*
deploring
the
loss
of
old
instruments
.
Riviere
,
not
wholly
ingenuously
,
*NL*
undertook
to
explain
to
Jimmy
the
triumph
of
the
French
mechanicians
.
*NL*
The
resonant
voice
of
the
Hungarian
was
about
to
prevail
in
ridicule
of
*NL*
the
spurious
lutes
of
the
romantic
painters
when
Segouin
shepherded
his
*NL*
party
into
politics
.
Here
was
congenial
ground
for
all
.
Jimmy
,
under
*NL*
generous
influences
,
felt
the
buried
zeal
of
his
father
wake
to
life
*NL*
within
him
:
he
aroused
the
torpid
Routh
at
last
.
The
room
grew
doubly
*NL*
hot
and
Segouin
's
task
grew
harder
each
moment
:
there
was
even
danger
*NL*
of
personal
spite
.
The
alert
host
at
an
opportunity
lifted
his
glass
*NL*
to
Humanity
and
,
when
the
toast
had
been
drunk
,
he
threw
open
a
window
*NL*
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
the
city
wore
the
mask
of
a
capital
.
The
five
young
men
*NL*
strolled
along
Stephen
's
Green
in
a
faint
cloud
of
aromatic
smoke
.
They
*NL*
talked
loudly
and
gaily
and
their
cloaks
dangled
from
their
shoulders
.
*NL*
The
people
made
way
for
them
.
At
the
corner
of
Grafton
Street
a
short
*NL*
fat
man
was
putting
two
handsome
ladies
on
a
car
in
charge
of
another
*NL*
fat
man
.
The
car
drove
off
and
the
short
fat
man
caught
sight
of
the
*NL*
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Farley
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
torrent
of
talk
followed
.
Farley
was
an
American
.
No
one
knew
very
*NL*
well
what
the
talk
was
about
.
Villona
and
Riviere
were
the
noisiest
,
*NL*
but
all
the
men
were
excited
.
They
got
up
on
a
car
,
squeezing
themselves
*NL*
together
amid
much
laughter
.
They
drove
by
the
crowd
,
blended
now
into
*NL*
soft
colours
,
to
a
music
of
merry
bells
.
They
took
the
train
at
Westland
*NL*
Row
and
in
a
few
seconds
,
as
it
seemed
to
Jimmy
,
they
were
walking
out
*NL*
of
Kingstown
Station
.
The
ticket-collector
saluted
Jimmy
;
he
was
an
old
*NL*
man
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
night
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
serene
summer
night
;
the
harbour
lay
like
a
darkened
mirror
at
*NL*
their
feet
.
They
proceeded
towards
it
with
linked
arms
,
singing
Cadet
*NL*
Roussel
in
chorus
,
stamping
their
feet
at
every
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
!
Ho
!
Hohe
,
vraiment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
got
into
a
rowboat
at
the
slip
and
made
out
for
the
American
's
*NL*
yacht
.
There
was
to
be
supper
,
music
,
cards
.
Villona
said
with
*NL*
conviction
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
delightful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
yacht
piano
in
the
cabin
.
Villona
played
a
waltz
for
Farley
*NL*
and
Riviere
,
Farley
acting
as
cavalier
and
Riviere
as
lady
.
Then
*NL*
an
impromptu
square
dance
,
the
men
devising
original
figures
.
What
*NL*
merriment
!
Jimmy
took
his
part
with
a
will
;
this
was
seeing
life
,
at
*NL*
least
.
Then
Farley
got
out
of
breath
and
cried
``
Stop
!
''
A
man
brought
in
*NL*
a
light
supper
,
and
the
young
men
sat
down
to
it
for
form
's
sake
.
They
*NL*
drank
,
however
:
it
was
Bohemian
.
They
drank
Ireland
,
England
,
France
,
*NL*
Hungary
,
the
United
States
of
America
.
Jimmy
made
a
speech
,
a
long
*NL*
speech
,
Villona
saying
:
``
Hear
!
hear
!
''
whenever
there
was
a
pause
.
There
*NL*
was
a
great
clapping
of
hands
when
he
sat
down
.
It
must
have
been
a
good
*NL*
speech
.
Farley
clapped
him
on
the
back
and
laughed
loudly
.
What
jovial
*NL*
fellows
!
What
good
company
they
were
!
*NL*
*NL*
Cards
!
cards
!
The
table
was
cleared
.
Villona
returned
quietly
to
his
*NL*
piano
and
played
voluntaries
for
them
.
The
other
men
played
game
after
*NL*
game
,
flinging
themselves
boldly
into
the
adventure
.
They
drank
the
*NL*
health
of
the
Queen
of
Hearts
and
of
the
Queen
of
Diamonds
.
Jimmy
felt
*NL*
obscurely
the
lack
of
an
audience
:
the
wit
was
flashing
.
Play
ran
very
*NL*
high
and
paper
began
to
pass
.
Jimmy
did
not
know
exactly
who
was
*NL*
winning
but
he
knew
that
he
was
losing
.
But
it
was
his
own
fault
for
*NL*
he
frequently
mistook
his
cards
and
the
other
men
had
to
calculate
his
*NL*
I.O.U.
's
for
him
.
They
were
devils
of
fellows
but
he
wished
they
would
*NL*
stop
:
it
was
getting
late
.
Someone
gave
the
toast
of
the
yacht
The
Belle
*NL*
of
Newport
and
then
someone
proposed
one
great
game
for
a
finish
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
piano
had
stopped
;
Villona
must
have
gone
up
on
deck
.
It
was
a
*NL*
terrible
game
.
They
stopped
just
before
the
end
of
it
to
drink
for
*NL*
luck
.
Jimmy
understood
that
the
game
lay
between
Routh
and
Segouin
.
What
*NL*
excitement
!
Jimmy
was
excited
too
;
he
would
lose
,
of
course
.
How
much
*NL*
had
he
written
away
?
The
men
rose
to
their
feet
to
play
the
last
tricks
.
*NL*
talking
and
gesticulating
.
Routh
won
.
The
cabin
shook
with
the
young
*NL*
men
's
cheering
and
the
cards
were
bundled
together
.
They
began
then
to
*NL*
gather
in
what
they
had
won
.
Farley
and
Jimmy
were
the
heaviest
losers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
that
he
would
regret
in
the
morning
but
at
present
he
was
glad
*NL*
of
the
rest
,
glad
of
the
dark
stupor
that
would
cover
up
his
folly
.
He
*NL*
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
rested
his
head
between
his
hands
,
*NL*
counting
the
beats
of
his
temples
.
The
cabin
door
opened
and
he
saw
the
*NL*
Hungarian
standing
in
a
shaft
of
grey
light
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daybreak
,
gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*

TWO
GALLANTS
*NL*
*NL*
THE
grey
warm
evening
of
August
had
descended
upon
the
city
and
a
mild
*NL*
warm
air
,
a
memory
of
summer
,
circulated
in
the
streets
.
The
streets
,
*NL*
shuttered
for
the
repose
of
Sunday
,
swarmed
with
a
gaily
coloured
crowd
.
*NL*
Like
illumined
pearls
the
lamps
shone
from
the
summits
of
their
tall
*NL*
poles
upon
the
living
texture
below
which
,
changing
shape
and
hue
*NL*
unceasingly
,
sent
up
into
the
warm
grey
evening
air
an
unchanging
*NL*
unceasing
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
young
men
came
down
the
hill
of
Rutland
Square
.
One
of
them
was
just
*NL*
bringing
a
long
monologue
to
a
close
.
The
other
,
who
walked
on
the
verge
*NL*
of
the
path
and
was
at
times
obliged
to
step
on
to
the
road
,
owing
to
*NL*
his
companion
's
rudeness
,
wore
an
amused
listening
face
.
He
was
squat
*NL*
and
ruddy
.
A
yachting
cap
was
shoved
far
back
from
his
forehead
and
the
*NL*
narrative
to
which
he
listened
made
constant
waves
of
expression
break
*NL*
forth
over
his
face
from
the
corners
of
his
nose
and
eyes
and
mouth
.
*NL*
Little
jets
of
wheezing
laughter
followed
one
another
out
of
his
*NL*
convulsed
body
.
His
eyes
,
twinkling
with
cunning
enjoyment
,
glanced
at
*NL*
every
moment
towards
his
companion
's
face
.
Once
or
twice
he
rearranged
*NL*
the
light
waterproof
which
he
had
slung
over
one
shoulder
in
toreador
*NL*
fashion
.
His
breeches
,
his
white
rubber
shoes
and
his
jauntily
slung
*NL*
waterproof
expressed
youth
.
But
his
figure
fell
into
rotundity
at
the
*NL*
waist
,
his
hair
was
scant
and
grey
and
his
face
,
when
the
waves
of
*NL*
expression
had
passed
over
it
,
had
a
ravaged
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
quite
sure
that
the
narrative
had
ended
he
laughed
*NL*
noiselessly
for
fully
half
a
minute
.
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
...
That
takes
the
biscuit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
seemed
winnowed
of
vigour
;
and
to
enforce
his
words
he
added
*NL*
with
humour
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
takes
the
solitary
,
unique
,
and
,
if
I
may
so
call
it
,
recherche
*NL*
biscuit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
serious
and
silent
when
he
had
said
this
.
His
tongue
was
tired
*NL*
for
he
had
been
talking
all
the
afternoon
in
a
public-house
in
Dorset
*NL*
Street
.
Most
people
considered
Lenehan
a
leech
but
,
in
spite
of
this
*NL*
reputation
,
his
adroitness
and
eloquence
had
always
prevented
his
*NL*
friends
from
forming
any
general
policy
against
him
.
He
had
a
brave
*NL*
manner
of
coming
up
to
a
party
of
them
in
a
bar
and
of
holding
himself
*NL*
nimbly
at
the
borders
of
the
company
until
he
was
included
in
a
round
.
*NL*
He
was
a
sporting
vagrant
armed
with
a
vast
stock
of
stories
,
limericks
*NL*
and
riddles
.
He
was
insensitive
to
all
kinds
of
discourtesy
.
No
one
*NL*
knew
how
he
achieved
the
stern
task
of
living
,
but
his
name
was
vaguely
*NL*
associated
with
racing
tissues
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
did
you
pick
her
up
,
Corley
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corley
ran
his
tongue
swiftly
along
his
upper
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
night
,
man
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
was
going
along
Dame
Street
and
I
spotted
*NL*
a
fine
tart
under
Waterhouse
's
clock
and
said
good-night
,
you
know
.
So
*NL*
we
went
for
a
walk
round
by
the
canal
and
she
told
me
she
was
a
slavey
*NL*
in
a
house
in
Baggot
Street
.
I
put
my
arm
round
her
and
squeezed
her
a
*NL*
bit
that
night
.
Then
next
Sunday
,
man
,
I
met
her
by
appointment
.
We
went
*NL*
out
to
Donnybrook
and
I
brought
her
into
a
field
there
.
She
told
me
she
*NL*
used
to
go
with
a
dairyman
...
It
was
fine
,
man
.
Cigarettes
every
night
*NL*
she
'd
bring
me
and
paying
the
tram
out
and
back
.
And
one
night
she
*NL*
brought
me
two
bloody
fine
cigars
--
O
,
the
real
cheese
,
you
know
,
that
*NL*
the
old
fellow
used
to
smoke
...
I
was
afraid
,
man
,
she
'd
get
in
the
*NL*
family
way
.
But
she
's
up
to
the
dodge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
she
thinks
you
'll
marry
her
,
''
said
Lenehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
her
I
was
out
of
a
job
,
''
said
Corley
.
``
I
told
her
I
was
in
*NL*
Pim
's
.
She
does
n't
know
my
name
.
I
was
too
hairy
to
tell
her
that
.
But
*NL*
she
thinks
I
'm
a
bit
of
class
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
laughed
again
,
noiselessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
all
the
good
ones
ever
I
heard
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
emphatically
takes
*NL*
the
biscuit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Corley
's
stride
acknowledged
the
compliment
.
The
swing
of
his
burly
body
*NL*
made
his
friend
execute
a
few
light
skips
from
the
path
to
the
roadway
*NL*
and
back
again
.
Corley
was
the
son
of
an
inspector
of
police
and
he
had
*NL*
inherited
his
father
's
frame
and
gait
.
He
walked
with
his
hands
by
his
*NL*
sides
,
holding
himself
erect
and
swaying
his
head
from
side
to
side
.
His
*NL*
head
was
large
,
globular
and
oily
;
it
sweated
in
all
weathers
;
and
his
*NL*
large
round
hat
,
set
upon
it
sideways
,
looked
like
a
bulb
which
had
*NL*
grown
out
of
another
.
He
always
stared
straight
before
him
as
if
he
were
*NL*
on
parade
and
,
when
he
wished
to
gaze
after
someone
in
the
street
,
it
*NL*
was
necessary
for
him
to
move
his
body
from
the
hips
.
At
present
he
was
*NL*
about
town
.
Whenever
any
job
was
vacant
a
friend
was
always
ready
to
*NL*
give
him
the
hard
word
.
He
was
often
to
be
seen
walking
with
policemen
*NL*
in
plain
clothes
,
talking
earnestly
.
He
knew
the
inner
side
of
all
*NL*
affairs
and
was
fond
of
delivering
final
judgments
.
He
spoke
without
*NL*
listening
to
the
speech
of
his
companions
.
His
conversation
was
mainly
*NL*
about
himself
:
what
he
had
said
to
such
a
person
and
what
such
a
person
*NL*
had
said
to
him
and
what
he
had
said
to
settle
the
matter
.
When
he
*NL*
reported
these
dialogues
he
aspirated
the
first
letter
of
his
name
after
*NL*
the
manner
of
Florentines
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
offered
his
friend
a
cigarette
.
As
the
two
young
men
walked
on
*NL*
through
the
crowd
Corley
occasionally
turned
to
smile
at
some
of
the
*NL*
passing
girls
but
Lenehan
's
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
large
faint
moon
*NL*
circled
with
a
double
halo
.
He
watched
earnestly
the
passing
of
the
grey
*NL*
web
of
twilight
across
its
face
.
At
length
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
...
tell
me
,
Corley
,
I
suppose
you
'll
be
able
to
pull
it
off
all
*NL*
right
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Corley
closed
one
eye
expressively
as
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
game
for
that
?
''
asked
Lenehan
dubiously
.
``
You
can
never
know
*NL*
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
all
right
,
''
said
Corley
.
``
I
know
the
way
to
get
around
her
,
man
.
*NL*
She
's
a
bit
gone
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
what
I
call
a
gay
Lothario
,
''
said
Lenehan
.
``
And
the
proper
kind
*NL*
of
a
Lothario
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
shade
of
mockery
relieved
the
servility
of
his
manner
.
To
save
himself
*NL*
he
had
the
habit
of
leaving
his
flattery
open
to
the
interpretation
of
*NL*
raillery
.
But
Corley
had
not
a
subtle
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
touch
a
good
slavey
,
''
he
affirmed
.
``
Take
my
tip
for
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
one
who
has
tried
them
all
,
''
said
Lenehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
I
used
to
go
with
girls
,
you
know
,
''
said
Corley
,
unbosoming
;
*NL*
``
girls
off
the
South
Circular
.
I
used
to
take
them
out
,
man
,
on
the
*NL*
tram
somewhere
and
pay
the
tram
or
take
them
to
a
band
or
a
play
at
the
*NL*
theatre
or
buy
them
chocolate
and
sweets
or
something
that
way
.
I
used
*NL*
to
spend
money
on
them
right
enough
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
convincing
tone
,
as
*NL*
if
he
was
conscious
of
being
disbelieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lenehan
could
well
believe
it
;
he
nodded
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
game
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
it
's
a
mug
's
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
damn
the
thing
I
ever
got
out
of
it
,
''
said
Corley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ditto
here
,
''
said
Lenehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
off
of
one
of
them
,
''
said
Corley
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moistened
his
upper
lip
by
running
his
tongue
along
it
.
The
*NL*
recollection
brightened
his
eyes
.
He
too
gazed
at
the
pale
disc
of
the
*NL*
moon
,
now
nearly
veiled
,
and
seemed
to
meditate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
...
a
bit
of
all
right
,
''
he
said
regretfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
again
.
Then
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
on
the
turf
now
.
I
saw
her
driving
down
Earl
Street
one
night
*NL*
with
two
fellows
with
her
on
a
car
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
's
your
doing
,
''
said
Lenehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
others
at
her
before
me
,
''
said
Corley
philosophically
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Lenehan
was
inclined
to
disbelieve
.
He
shook
his
head
to
and
*NL*
fro
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
you
ca
n't
kid
me
,
Corley
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honest
to
God
!
''
said
Corley
.
``
Did
n't
she
tell
me
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
made
a
tragic
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Base
betrayer
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
passed
along
the
railings
of
Trinity
College
,
Lenehan
skipped
*NL*
out
into
the
road
and
peered
up
at
the
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
after
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Time
enough
,
''
said
Corley
.
``
She
'll
be
there
all
right
.
I
always
let
her
*NL*
wait
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
laughed
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ecod
!
Corley
,
you
know
how
to
take
them
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
up
to
all
their
little
tricks
,
''
Corley
confessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
,
''
said
Lenehan
again
,
``
are
you
sure
you
can
bring
it
off
*NL*
all
right
?
You
know
it
's
a
ticklish
job
.
They
're
damn
close
on
that
*NL*
point
.
Eh
?
...
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
bright
,
small
eyes
searched
his
companion
's
face
for
reassurance
.
*NL*
Corley
swung
his
head
to
and
fro
as
if
to
toss
aside
an
insistent
*NL*
insect
,
and
his
brows
gathered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
pull
it
off
,
''
he
said
.
``
Leave
it
to
me
,
ca
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
said
no
more
.
He
did
not
wish
to
ruffle
his
friend
's
temper
,
to
*NL*
be
sent
to
the
devil
and
told
that
his
advice
was
not
wanted
.
A
little
*NL*
tact
was
necessary
.
But
Corley
's
brow
was
soon
smooth
again
.
His
*NL*
thoughts
were
running
another
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
fine
decent
tart
,
''
he
said
,
with
appreciation
;
``
that
's
what
she
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
along
Nassau
Street
and
then
turned
into
Kildare
Street
.
Not
*NL*
far
from
the
porch
of
the
club
a
harpist
stood
in
the
roadway
,
playing
*NL*
to
a
little
ring
of
listeners
.
He
plucked
at
the
wires
heedlessly
,
*NL*
glancing
quickly
from
time
to
time
at
the
face
of
each
new-comer
and
*NL*
from
time
to
time
,
wearily
also
,
at
the
sky
.
His
harp
,
too
,
heedless
*NL*
that
her
coverings
had
fallen
about
her
knees
,
seemed
weary
alike
of
the
*NL*
eyes
of
strangers
and
of
her
master
's
hands
.
One
hand
played
in
the
*NL*
bass
the
melody
of
Silent
,
O
Moyle
,
while
the
other
hand
careered
in
the
*NL*
treble
after
each
group
of
notes
.
The
notes
of
the
air
sounded
deep
and
*NL*
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
young
men
walked
up
the
street
without
speaking
,
the
mournful
*NL*
music
following
them
.
When
they
reached
Stephen
's
Green
they
crossed
the
*NL*
road
.
Here
the
noise
of
trams
,
the
lights
and
the
crowd
released
them
*NL*
from
their
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
she
is
!
''
said
Corley
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
corner
of
Hume
Street
a
young
woman
was
standing
.
She
wore
a
blue
*NL*
dress
and
a
white
sailor
hat
.
She
stood
on
the
curbstone
,
swinging
a
*NL*
sunshade
in
one
hand
.
Lenehan
grew
lively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
have
a
look
at
her
,
Corley
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corley
glanced
sideways
at
his
friend
and
an
unpleasant
grin
appeared
on
*NL*
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
trying
to
get
inside
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
!
''
said
Lenehan
boldly
,
``
I
do
n't
want
an
introduction
.
All
I
*NL*
want
is
to
have
a
look
at
her
.
I
'm
not
going
to
eat
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O.
.
.
A
look
at
her
?
''
said
Corley
,
more
amiably
.
``
Well
...
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
what
.
I
'll
go
over
and
talk
to
her
and
you
can
pass
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
!
''
said
Lenehan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corley
had
already
thrown
one
leg
over
the
chains
when
Lenehan
called
*NL*
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
after
?
Where
will
we
meet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
ten
,
''
answered
Corley
,
bringing
over
his
other
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Corner
of
Merrion
Street
.
We
'll
be
coming
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Work
it
all
right
now
,
''
said
Lenehan
in
farewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corley
did
not
answer
.
He
sauntered
across
the
road
swaying
his
head
*NL*
from
side
to
side
.
His
bulk
,
his
easy
pace
,
and
the
solid
sound
of
his
*NL*
boots
had
something
of
the
conqueror
in
them
.
He
approached
the
young
*NL*
woman
and
,
without
saluting
,
began
at
once
to
converse
with
her
.
She
*NL*
swung
her
umbrella
more
quickly
and
executed
half
turns
on
her
heels
.
*NL*
Once
or
twice
when
he
spoke
to
her
at
close
quarters
she
laughed
and
*NL*
bent
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
observed
them
for
a
few
minutes
.
Then
he
walked
rapidly
along
*NL*
beside
the
chains
at
some
distance
and
crossed
the
road
obliquely
.
As
he
*NL*
approached
Hume
Street
corner
he
found
the
air
heavily
scented
and
his
*NL*
eyes
made
a
swift
anxious
scrutiny
of
the
young
woman
's
appearance
.
She
*NL*
had
her
Sunday
finery
on
.
Her
blue
serge
skirt
was
held
at
the
waist
by
*NL*
a
belt
of
black
leather
.
The
great
silver
buckle
of
her
belt
seemed
to
*NL*
depress
the
centre
of
her
body
,
catching
the
light
stuff
of
her
white
*NL*
blouse
like
a
clip
.
She
wore
a
short
black
jacket
with
mother-of-pearl
*NL*
buttons
and
a
ragged
black
boa
.
The
ends
of
her
tulle
collarette
had
*NL*
been
carefully
disordered
and
a
big
bunch
of
red
flowers
was
pinned
*NL*
in
her
bosomm
stems
upwards
.
Lenehan
's
eyes
noted
approvingly
her
stout
*NL*
short
muscular
body
.
Frank
rude
health
glowed
in
her
face
,
on
her
fat
red
*NL*
cheeks
and
in
her
unabashed
blue
eyes
.
Her
features
were
blunt
.
She
had
*NL*
broad
nostrils
,
a
straggling
mouth
which
lay
open
in
a
contented
leer
,
*NL*
and
two
projecting
front
teeth
.
As
he
passed
Lenehan
took
off
his
cap
*NL*
and
,
after
about
ten
seconds
,
Corley
returned
a
salute
to
the
air
.
This
*NL*
he
did
by
raising
his
hand
vaguely
and
pensively
changing
the
angle
of
*NL*
position
of
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
walked
as
far
as
the
Shelbourne
Hotel
where
he
halted
and
*NL*
waited
.
After
waiting
for
a
little
time
he
saw
them
coming
towards
him
*NL*
and
,
when
they
turned
to
the
right
,
he
followed
them
,
stepping
lightly
*NL*
in
his
white
shoes
,
down
one
side
of
Merrion
Square
.
As
he
walked
on
*NL*
slowly
,
timing
his
pace
to
theirs
,
he
watched
Corley
's
head
which
turned
*NL*
at
every
moment
towards
the
young
woman
's
face
like
a
big
ball
revolving
*NL*
on
a
pivot
.
He
kept
the
pair
in
view
until
he
had
seen
them
climbing
the
*NL*
stairs
of
the
Donnybrook
tram
;
then
he
turned
about
and
went
back
the
*NL*
way
he
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
he
was
alone
his
face
looked
older
.
His
gaiety
seemed
to
*NL*
forsake
him
and
,
as
he
came
by
the
railings
of
the
Duke
's
Lawn
,
he
*NL*
allowed
his
hand
to
run
along
them
.
The
air
which
the
harpist
had
played
*NL*
began
to
control
his
movements
.
His
softly
padded
feet
played
the
melody
*NL*
while
his
fingers
swept
a
scale
of
variations
idly
along
the
railings
*NL*
after
each
group
of
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
listlessly
round
Stephen
's
Green
and
then
down
Grafton
Street
.
*NL*
Though
his
eyes
took
note
of
many
elements
of
the
crowd
through
which
*NL*
he
passed
they
did
so
morosely
.
He
found
trivial
all
that
was
meant
to
*NL*
charm
him
and
did
not
answer
the
glances
which
invited
him
to
be
bold
.
*NL*
He
knew
that
he
would
have
to
speak
a
great
deal
,
to
invent
and
to
amuse
,
*NL*
and
his
brain
and
throat
were
too
dry
for
such
a
task
.
The
problem
of
*NL*
how
he
could
pass
the
hours
till
he
met
Corley
again
troubled
him
a
*NL*
little
.
He
could
think
of
no
way
of
passing
them
but
to
keep
on
walking
.
*NL*
He
turned
to
the
left
when
he
came
to
the
corner
of
Rutland
Square
and
*NL*
felt
more
at
ease
in
the
dark
quiet
street
,
the
sombre
look
of
which
*NL*
suited
his
mood
.
He
paused
at
last
before
the
window
of
a
poor-looking
*NL*
shop
over
which
the
words
Refreshment
Bar
were
printed
in
white
letters
.
*NL*
On
the
glass
of
the
window
were
two
flying
inscriptions
:
Ginger
Beer
and
*NL*
Ginger
Ale
.
A
cut
ham
was
exposed
on
a
great
blue
dish
while
near
it
*NL*
on
a
plate
lay
a
segment
of
very
light
plum-pudding
.
He
eyed
this
food
*NL*
earnestly
for
some
time
and
then
,
after
glancing
warily
up
and
down
the
*NL*
street
,
went
into
the
shop
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
hungry
for
,
except
some
biscuits
which
he
had
asked
two
grudging
*NL*
curates
to
bring
him
,
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast-time
.
He
*NL*
sat
down
at
an
uncovered
wooden
table
opposite
two
work-girls
and
a
*NL*
mechanic
.
A
slatternly
girl
waited
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
is
a
plate
of
peas
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
halfpence
,
sir
,
''
said
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
me
a
plate
of
peas
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
a
bottle
of
ginger
beer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
roughly
in
order
to
belie
his
air
of
gentility
for
his
entry
*NL*
had
been
followed
by
a
pause
of
talk
.
His
face
was
heated
.
To
appear
*NL*
natural
he
pushed
his
cap
back
on
his
head
and
planted
his
elbows
on
the
*NL*
table
.
The
mechanic
and
the
two
work-girls
examined
him
point
by
point
*NL*
before
resuming
their
conversation
in
a
subdued
voice
.
The
girl
brought
*NL*
him
a
plate
of
grocer
's
hot
peas
,
seasoned
with
pepper
and
vinegar
,
a
*NL*
fork
and
his
ginger
beer
.
He
ate
his
food
greedily
and
found
it
so
good
*NL*
that
he
made
a
note
of
the
shop
mentally
.
When
he
had
eaten
all
the
peas
*NL*
he
sipped
his
ginger
beer
and
sat
for
some
time
thinking
of
Corley
's
*NL*
adventure
.
In
his
imagination
he
beheld
the
pair
of
lovers
walking
along
*NL*
some
dark
road
;
he
heard
Corley
's
voice
in
deep
energetic
gallantries
*NL*
and
saw
again
the
leer
of
the
young
woman
's
mouth
.
This
vision
made
*NL*
him
feel
keenly
his
own
poverty
of
purse
and
spirit
.
He
was
tired
*NL*
of
knocking
about
,
of
pulling
the
devil
by
the
tail
,
of
shifts
and
*NL*
intrigues
.
He
would
be
thirty-one
in
November
.
Would
he
never
get
a
good
*NL*
job
?
Would
he
never
have
a
home
of
his
own
?
He
thought
how
pleasant
it
*NL*
would
be
to
have
a
warm
fire
to
sit
by
and
a
good
dinner
to
sit
down
to
.
*NL*
He
had
walked
the
streets
long
enough
with
friends
and
with
girls
.
He
*NL*
knew
what
those
friends
were
worth
:
he
knew
the
girls
too
.
Experience
*NL*
had
embittered
his
heart
against
the
world
.
But
all
hope
had
not
left
*NL*
him
.
He
felt
better
after
having
eaten
than
he
had
felt
before
,
less
*NL*
weary
of
his
life
,
less
vanquished
in
spirit
.
He
might
yet
be
able
to
*NL*
settle
down
in
some
snug
corner
and
live
happily
if
he
could
only
come
*NL*
across
some
good
simple-minded
girl
with
a
little
of
the
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paid
twopence
halfpenny
to
the
slatternly
girl
and
went
out
of
the
*NL*
shop
to
begin
his
wandering
again
.
He
went
into
Capel
Street
and
walked
*NL*
along
towards
the
City
Hall
.
Then
he
turned
into
Dame
Street
.
At
the
*NL*
corner
of
George
's
Street
he
met
two
friends
of
his
and
stopped
to
*NL*
converse
with
them
.
He
was
glad
that
he
could
rest
from
all
his
walking
.
*NL*
His
friends
asked
him
had
he
seen
Corley
and
what
was
the
latest
.
He
*NL*
replied
that
he
had
spent
the
day
with
Corley
.
His
friends
talked
*NL*
very
little
.
They
looked
vacantly
after
some
figures
in
the
crowd
and
*NL*
sometimes
made
a
critical
remark
.
One
said
that
he
had
seen
Mac
an
hour
*NL*
before
in
Westmoreland
Street
.
At
this
Lenehan
said
that
he
had
been
*NL*
with
Mac
the
night
before
in
Egan
's
.
The
young
man
who
had
seen
Mac
*NL*
in
Westmoreland
Street
asked
was
it
true
that
Mac
had
won
a
bit
over
*NL*
a
billiard
match
.
Lenehan
did
not
know
:
he
said
that
Holohan
had
stood
*NL*
them
drinks
in
Egan
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
his
friends
at
a
quarter
to
ten
and
went
up
George
's
Street
.
*NL*
He
turned
to
the
left
at
the
City
Markets
and
walked
on
into
Grafton
*NL*
Street
.
The
crowd
of
girls
and
young
men
had
thinned
and
on
his
way
*NL*
up
the
street
he
heard
many
groups
and
couples
bidding
one
another
*NL*
good-night
.
He
went
as
far
as
the
clock
of
the
College
of
Surgeons
:
it
*NL*
was
on
the
stroke
of
ten
.
He
set
off
briskly
along
the
northern
side
*NL*
of
the
Green
hurrying
for
fear
Corley
should
return
too
soon
.
When
he
*NL*
reached
the
corner
of
Merrion
Street
he
took
his
stand
in
the
shadow
of
*NL*
a
lamp
and
brought
out
one
of
the
cigarettes
which
he
had
reserved
and
*NL*
lit
it
.
He
leaned
against
the
lamp-post
and
kept
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
*NL*
part
from
which
he
expected
to
see
Corley
and
the
young
woman
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
became
active
again
.
He
wondered
had
Corley
managed
it
*NL*
successfully
.
He
wondered
if
he
had
asked
her
yet
or
if
he
would
leave
*NL*
it
to
the
last
.
He
suffered
all
the
pangs
and
thrills
of
his
friend
's
*NL*
situation
as
well
as
those
of
his
own
.
But
the
memory
of
Corley
's
slowly
*NL*
revolving
head
calmed
him
somewhat
:
he
was
sure
Corley
would
pull
it
off
*NL*
all
right
.
All
at
once
the
idea
struck
him
that
perhaps
Corley
had
seen
*NL*
her
home
by
another
way
and
given
him
the
slip
.
His
eyes
searched
the
*NL*
street
:
there
was
no
sign
of
them
.
Yet
it
was
surely
half-an-hour
since
*NL*
he
had
seen
the
clock
of
the
College
of
Surgeons
.
Would
Corley
do
*NL*
a
thing
like
that
?
He
lit
his
last
cigarette
and
began
to
smoke
it
*NL*
nervously
.
He
strained
his
eyes
as
each
tram
stopped
at
the
far
corner
*NL*
of
the
square
.
They
must
have
gone
home
by
another
way
.
The
paper
of
his
*NL*
cigarette
broke
and
he
flung
it
into
the
road
with
a
curse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
saw
them
coming
towards
him
.
He
started
with
delight
and
,
*NL*
keeping
close
to
his
lamp-post
,
tried
to
read
the
result
in
their
walk
.
*NL*
They
were
walking
quickly
,
the
young
woman
taking
quick
short
steps
,
*NL*
while
Corley
kept
beside
her
with
his
long
stride
.
They
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
be
speaking
.
An
intimation
of
the
result
pricked
him
like
the
point
of
a
*NL*
sharp
instrument
.
He
knew
Corley
would
fail
;
he
knew
it
was
no
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
down
Baggot
Street
and
he
followed
them
at
once
,
taking
the
*NL*
other
footpath
.
When
they
stopped
he
stopped
too
.
They
talked
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
and
then
the
young
woman
went
down
the
steps
into
the
area
of
*NL*
a
house
.
Corley
remained
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
path
,
a
little
*NL*
distance
from
the
front
steps
.
Some
minutes
passed
.
Then
the
hall-door
*NL*
was
opened
slowly
and
cautiously
.
A
woman
came
running
down
the
front
*NL*
steps
and
coughed
.
Corley
turned
and
went
towards
her
.
His
broad
figure
*NL*
hid
hers
from
view
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
she
reappeared
running
*NL*
up
the
steps
.
The
door
closed
on
her
and
Corley
began
to
walk
swiftly
*NL*
towards
Stephen
's
Green
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
hurried
on
in
the
same
direction
.
Some
drops
of
light
rain
fell
.
*NL*
He
took
them
as
a
warning
and
,
glancing
back
towards
the
house
which
the
*NL*
young
woman
had
entered
to
see
that
he
was
not
observed
,
he
ran
eagerly
*NL*
across
the
road
.
Anxiety
and
his
swift
run
made
him
pant
.
He
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Corley
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Corley
turned
his
head
to
see
who
had
called
him
,
and
then
continued
*NL*
walking
as
before
.
Lenehan
ran
after
him
,
settling
the
waterproof
on
his
*NL*
shoulders
with
one
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Corley
!
''
he
cried
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
level
with
his
friend
and
looked
keenly
in
his
face
.
He
could
*NL*
see
nothing
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
said
.
``
Did
it
come
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
reached
the
corner
of
Ely
Place
.
Still
without
answering
,
*NL*
Corley
swerved
to
the
left
and
went
up
the
side
street
.
His
features
*NL*
were
composed
in
stern
calm
.
Lenehan
kept
up
with
his
friend
,
breathing
*NL*
uneasily
.
He
was
baffled
and
a
note
of
menace
pierced
through
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
tell
us
?
''
he
said
.
``
Did
you
try
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Corley
halted
at
the
first
lamp
and
stared
grimly
before
him
.
Then
*NL*
with
a
grave
gesture
he
extended
a
hand
towards
the
light
and
,
smiling
,
*NL*
opened
it
slowly
to
the
gaze
of
his
disciple
.
A
small
gold
coin
shone
in
*NL*
the
palm
.
*NL*

*NL*
THE
BOARDING
HOUSE
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
MOONEY
was
a
butcher
's
daughter
.
She
was
a
woman
who
was
quite
*NL*
able
to
keep
things
to
herself
:
a
determined
woman
.
She
had
married
her
*NL*
father
's
foreman
and
opened
a
butcher
's
shop
near
Spring
Gardens
.
But
as
*NL*
soon
as
his
father-in-law
was
dead
Mr.
Mooney
began
to
go
to
the
devil
.
*NL*
He
drank
,
plundered
the
till
,
ran
headlong
into
debt
.
It
was
no
use
*NL*
making
him
take
the
pledge
:
he
was
sure
to
break
out
again
a
few
days
*NL*
after
.
By
fighting
his
wife
in
the
presence
of
customers
and
by
buying
*NL*
bad
meat
he
ruined
his
business
.
One
night
he
went
for
his
wife
with
the
*NL*
cleaver
and
she
had
to
sleep
in
a
neighbour
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
they
lived
apart
.
She
went
to
the
priest
and
got
a
separation
*NL*
from
him
with
care
of
the
children
.
She
would
give
him
neither
money
*NL*
nor
food
nor
house-room
;
and
so
he
was
obliged
to
enlist
himself
as
a
*NL*
sheriff
's
man
.
He
was
a
shabby
stooped
little
drunkard
with
a
white
face
*NL*
and
a
white
moustache
and
white
eyebrows
,
pencilled
above
his
little
eyes
,
*NL*
which
were
pink-veined
and
raw
;
and
all
day
long
he
sat
in
the
bailiff
's
*NL*
room
,
waiting
to
be
put
on
a
job
.
Mrs.
Mooney
,
who
had
taken
what
*NL*
remained
of
her
money
out
of
the
butcher
business
and
set
up
a
boarding
*NL*
house
in
Hardwicke
Street
,
was
a
big
imposing
woman
.
Her
house
had
a
*NL*
floating
population
made
up
of
tourists
from
Liverpool
and
the
Isle
*NL*
of
Man
and
,
occasionally
,
artistes
from
the
music
halls
.
Its
resident
*NL*
population
was
made
up
of
clerks
from
the
city
.
She
governed
her
house
*NL*
cunningly
and
firmly
,
knew
when
to
give
credit
,
when
to
be
stern
and
*NL*
when
to
let
things
pass
.
All
the
resident
young
men
spoke
of
her
as
The
*NL*
Madam
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Mooney
's
young
men
paid
fifteen
shillings
a
week
for
board
and
*NL*
lodgings
-LRB-
beer
or
stout
at
dinner
excluded
-RRB-
.
They
shared
in
common
*NL*
tastes
and
occupations
and
for
this
reason
they
were
very
chummy
with
*NL*
one
another
.
They
discussed
with
one
another
the
chances
of
favourites
*NL*
and
outsiders
.
Jack
Mooney
,
the
Madam
's
son
,
who
was
clerk
to
a
*NL*
commission
agent
in
Fleet
Street
,
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
hard
*NL*
case
.
He
was
fond
of
using
soldiers
'
obscenities
:
usually
he
came
home
*NL*
in
the
small
hours
.
When
he
met
his
friends
he
had
always
a
good
one
*NL*
to
tell
them
and
he
was
always
sure
to
be
on
to
a
good
thing
--
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
a
likely
horse
or
a
likely
artiste
.
He
was
also
handy
with
the
mits
*NL*
and
sang
comic
songs
.
On
Sunday
nights
there
would
often
be
a
reunion
in
*NL*
Mrs.
Mooney
's
front
drawing-room
.
The
music-hall
artistes
would
oblige
;
*NL*
and
Sheridan
played
waltzes
and
polkas
and
vamped
accompaniments
.
Polly
*NL*
Mooney
,
the
Madam
's
daughter
,
would
also
sing
.
She
sang
:
*NL*
*NL*
I
'm
a.
.
.
naughty
girl
.
*NL*
You
need
n't
sham
:
*NL*
You
know
I
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
Polly
was
a
slim
girl
of
nineteen
;
she
had
light
soft
hair
and
a
small
*NL*
full
mouth
.
Her
eyes
,
which
were
grey
with
a
shade
of
green
through
*NL*
them
,
had
a
habit
of
glancing
upwards
when
she
spoke
with
anyone
,
which
*NL*
made
her
look
like
a
little
perverse
madonna
.
Mrs.
Mooney
had
first
*NL*
sent
her
daughter
to
be
a
typist
in
a
corn-factor
's
office
but
,
as
a
*NL*
disreputable
sheriff
's
man
used
to
come
every
other
day
to
the
office
,
*NL*
asking
to
be
allowed
to
say
a
word
to
his
daughter
,
she
had
taken
her
*NL*
daughter
home
again
and
set
her
to
do
housework
.
As
Polly
was
very
*NL*
lively
the
intention
was
to
give
her
the
run
of
the
young
men
.
Besides
,
*NL*
young
men
like
to
feel
that
there
is
a
young
woman
not
very
far
away
.
*NL*
Polly
,
of
course
,
flirted
with
the
young
men
but
Mrs.
Mooney
,
who
was
a
*NL*
shrewd
judge
,
knew
that
the
young
men
were
only
passing
the
time
away
:
*NL*
none
of
them
meant
business
.
Things
went
on
so
for
a
long
time
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Mooney
began
to
think
of
sending
Polly
back
to
typewriting
when
she
*NL*
noticed
that
something
was
going
on
between
Polly
and
one
of
the
young
*NL*
men
.
She
watched
the
pair
and
kept
her
own
counsel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Polly
knew
that
she
was
being
watched
,
but
still
her
mother
's
persistent
*NL*
silence
could
not
be
misunderstood
.
There
had
been
no
open
complicity
*NL*
between
mother
and
daughter
,
no
open
understanding
but
,
though
people
*NL*
in
the
house
began
to
talk
of
the
affair
,
still
Mrs.
Mooney
did
not
*NL*
intervene
.
Polly
began
to
grow
a
little
strange
in
her
manner
and
the
*NL*
young
man
was
evidently
perturbed
.
At
last
,
when
she
judged
it
to
be
the
*NL*
right
moment
,
Mrs.
Mooney
intervened
.
She
dealt
with
moral
problems
as
a
*NL*
cleaver
deals
with
meat
:
and
in
this
case
she
had
made
up
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bright
Sunday
morning
of
early
summer
,
promising
heat
,
but
with
*NL*
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
.
All
the
windows
of
the
boarding
house
were
open
*NL*
and
the
lace
curtains
ballooned
gently
towards
the
street
beneath
the
*NL*
raised
sashes
.
The
belfry
of
George
's
Church
sent
out
constant
peals
and
*NL*
worshippers
,
singly
or
in
groups
,
traversed
the
little
circus
before
*NL*
the
church
,
revealing
their
purpose
by
their
self-contained
demeanour
*NL*
no
less
than
by
the
little
volumes
in
their
gloved
hands
.
Breakfast
*NL*
was
over
in
the
boarding
house
and
the
table
of
the
breakfast-room
was
*NL*
covered
with
plates
on
which
lay
yellow
streaks
of
eggs
with
morsels
*NL*
of
bacon-fat
and
bacon-rind
.
Mrs.
Mooney
sat
in
the
straw
arm-chair
*NL*
and
watched
the
servant
Mary
remove
the
breakfast
things
.
She
made
Mary
*NL*
collect
the
crusts
and
pieces
of
broken
bread
to
help
to
make
Tuesday
's
*NL*
bread-pudding
.
When
the
table
was
cleared
,
the
broken
bread
collected
,
*NL*
the
sugar
and
butter
safe
under
lock
and
key
,
she
began
to
reconstruct
*NL*
the
interview
which
she
had
had
the
night
before
with
Polly
.
Things
were
*NL*
as
she
had
suspected
:
she
had
been
frank
in
her
questions
and
Polly
had
*NL*
been
frank
in
her
answers
.
Both
had
been
somewhat
awkward
,
of
course
.
*NL*
She
had
been
made
awkward
by
her
not
wishing
to
receive
the
news
in
too
*NL*
cavalier
a
fashion
or
to
seem
to
have
connived
and
Polly
had
been
*NL*
made
awkward
not
merely
because
allusions
of
that
kind
always
made
her
*NL*
awkward
but
also
because
she
did
not
wish
it
to
be
thought
that
in
*NL*
her
wise
innocence
she
had
divined
the
intention
behind
her
mother
's
*NL*
tolerance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Mooney
glanced
instinctively
at
the
little
gilt
clock
on
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
as
soon
as
she
had
become
aware
through
her
revery
that
the
*NL*
bells
of
George
's
Church
had
stopped
ringing
.
It
was
seventeen
minutes
*NL*
past
eleven
:
she
would
have
lots
of
time
to
have
the
matter
out
with
Mr.
*NL*
Doran
and
then
catch
short
twelve
at
Marlborough
Street
.
She
was
sure
*NL*
she
would
win
.
To
begin
with
she
had
all
the
weight
of
social
opinion
*NL*
on
her
side
:
she
was
an
outraged
mother
.
She
had
allowed
him
to
live
*NL*
beneath
her
roof
,
assuming
that
he
was
a
man
of
honour
,
and
he
had
simply
*NL*
abused
her
hospitality
.
He
was
thirty-four
or
thirty-five
years
of
age
,
*NL*
so
that
youth
could
not
be
pleaded
as
his
excuse
;
nor
could
ignorance
*NL*
be
his
excuse
since
he
was
a
man
who
had
seen
something
of
the
world
.
He
*NL*
had
simply
taken
advantage
of
Polly
's
youth
and
inexperience
:
that
was
*NL*
evident
.
The
question
was
:
What
reparation
would
he
make
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
must
be
reparation
made
in
such
cases
.
It
is
all
very
well
for
*NL*
the
man
:
he
can
go
his
ways
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
having
had
his
*NL*
moment
of
pleasure
,
but
the
girl
has
to
bear
the
brunt
.
Some
mothers
*NL*
would
be
content
to
patch
up
such
an
affair
for
a
sum
of
money
;
she
had
*NL*
known
cases
of
it
.
But
she
would
not
do
so
.
For
her
only
one
reparation
*NL*
could
make
up
for
the
loss
of
her
daughter
's
honour
:
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
counted
all
her
cards
again
before
sending
Mary
up
to
Mr.
Doran
's
room
*NL*
to
say
that
she
wished
to
speak
with
him
.
She
felt
sure
she
would
win
.
*NL*
He
was
a
serious
young
man
,
not
rakish
or
loud-voiced
like
the
others
.
*NL*
If
it
had
been
Mr.
Sheridan
or
Mr.
Meade
or
Bantam
Lyons
her
task
would
*NL*
have
been
much
harder
.
She
did
not
think
he
would
face
publicity
.
All
*NL*
the
lodgers
in
the
house
knew
something
of
the
affair
;
details
had
been
*NL*
invented
by
some
.
Besides
,
he
had
been
employed
for
thirteen
years
in
a
*NL*
great
Catholic
wine-merchant
's
office
and
publicity
would
mean
for
him
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
the
loss
of
his
job
.
Whereas
if
he
agreed
all
might
be
well
.
*NL*
She
knew
he
had
a
good
screw
for
one
thing
and
she
suspected
he
had
a
*NL*
bit
of
stuff
put
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
the
half-hour
!
She
stood
up
and
surveyed
herself
in
the
*NL*
pier-glass
.
The
decisive
expression
of
her
great
florid
face
satisfied
*NL*
her
and
she
thought
of
some
mothers
she
knew
who
could
not
get
their
*NL*
daughters
off
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Doran
was
very
anxious
indeed
this
Sunday
morning
.
He
had
made
two
*NL*
attempts
to
shave
but
his
hand
had
been
so
unsteady
that
he
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
desist
.
Three
days
'
reddish
beard
fringed
his
jaws
and
every
*NL*
two
or
three
minutes
a
mist
gathered
on
his
glasses
so
that
he
had
*NL*
to
take
them
off
and
polish
them
with
his
pocket-handkerchief
.
The
*NL*
recollection
of
his
confession
of
the
night
before
was
a
cause
of
acute
*NL*
pain
to
him
;
the
priest
had
drawn
out
every
ridiculous
detail
of
the
*NL*
affair
and
in
the
end
had
so
magnified
his
sin
that
he
was
almost
*NL*
thankful
at
being
afforded
a
loophole
of
reparation
.
The
harm
was
done
.
*NL*
What
could
he
do
now
but
marry
her
or
run
away
?
He
could
not
brazen
it
*NL*
out
.
The
affair
would
be
sure
to
be
talked
of
and
his
employer
would
*NL*
be
certain
to
hear
of
it
.
Dublin
is
such
a
small
city
:
everyone
knows
*NL*
everyone
else
's
business
.
He
felt
his
heart
leap
warmly
in
his
throat
as
*NL*
he
heard
in
his
excited
imagination
old
Mr.
Leonard
calling
out
in
his
*NL*
rasping
voice
:
``
Send
Mr.
Doran
here
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
his
long
years
of
service
gone
for
nothing
!
All
his
industry
and
*NL*
diligence
thrown
away
!
As
a
young
man
he
had
sown
his
wild
oats
,
of
*NL*
course
;
he
had
boasted
of
his
free-thinking
and
denied
the
existence
of
*NL*
God
to
his
companions
in
public-houses
.
But
that
was
all
passed
and
done
*NL*
with
...
nearly
.
He
still
bought
a
copy
of
Reynolds
's
Newspaper
every
*NL*
week
but
he
attended
to
his
religious
duties
and
for
nine-tenths
of
the
*NL*
year
lived
a
regular
life
.
He
had
money
enough
to
settle
down
on
;
it
was
*NL*
not
that
.
But
the
family
would
look
down
on
her
.
First
of
all
there
*NL*
was
her
disreputable
father
and
then
her
mother
's
boarding
house
was
*NL*
beginning
to
get
a
certain
fame
.
He
had
a
notion
that
he
was
being
had
.
*NL*
He
could
imagine
his
friends
talking
of
the
affair
and
laughing
.
She
was
*NL*
a
little
vulgar
;
some
times
she
said
``
I
seen
''
and
``
If
I
had
've
known
.
''
*NL*
But
what
would
grammar
matter
if
he
really
loved
her
?
He
could
not
make
*NL*
up
his
mind
whether
to
like
her
or
despise
her
for
what
she
had
done
.
Of
*NL*
course
he
had
done
it
too
.
His
instinct
urged
him
to
remain
free
,
not
to
*NL*
marry
.
Once
you
are
married
you
are
done
for
,
it
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
sitting
helplessly
on
the
side
of
the
bed
in
shirt
and
*NL*
trousers
she
tapped
lightly
at
his
door
and
entered
.
She
told
him
all
,
*NL*
that
she
had
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
her
mother
and
that
her
mother
*NL*
would
speak
with
him
that
morning
.
She
cried
and
threw
her
arms
round
*NL*
his
neck
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Bob
!
Bob
!
What
am
I
to
do
?
What
am
I
to
do
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
put
an
end
to
herself
,
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
comforted
her
feebly
,
telling
her
not
to
cry
,
that
it
would
be
all
*NL*
right
,
never
fear
.
He
felt
against
his
shirt
the
agitation
of
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
altogether
his
fault
that
it
had
happened
.
He
remembered
*NL*
well
,
with
the
curious
patient
memory
of
the
celibate
,
the
first
casual
*NL*
caresses
her
dress
,
her
breath
,
her
fingers
had
given
him
.
Then
late
one
*NL*
night
as
he
was
undressing
for
bed
she
had
tapped
at
his
door
,
timidly
.
She
*NL*
wanted
to
relight
her
candle
at
his
for
hers
had
been
blown
out
by
a
*NL*
gust
.
It
was
her
bath
night
.
She
wore
a
loose
open
combing-jacket
of
*NL*
printed
flannel
.
Her
white
instep
shone
in
the
opening
of
her
furry
*NL*
slippers
and
the
blood
glowed
warmly
behind
her
perfumed
skin
.
From
her
*NL*
hands
and
wrists
too
as
she
lit
and
steadied
her
candle
a
faint
perfume
*NL*
arose
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
nights
when
he
came
in
very
late
it
was
she
who
warmed
up
his
dinner
.
*NL*
He
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
eating
,
feeling
her
beside
him
alone
,
at
*NL*
night
,
in
the
sleeping
house
.
And
her
thoughtfulness
!
If
the
night
was
*NL*
anyway
cold
or
wet
or
windy
there
was
sure
to
be
a
little
tumbler
of
*NL*
punch
ready
for
him
.
Perhaps
they
could
be
happy
together
...
*NL*
*NL*
They
used
to
go
upstairs
together
on
tiptoe
,
each
with
a
candle
,
and
on
*NL*
the
third
landing
exchange
reluctant
good-nights
.
They
used
to
kiss
.
He
*NL*
remembered
well
her
eyes
,
the
touch
of
her
hand
and
his
delirium
...
*NL*
*NL*
But
delirium
passes
.
He
echoed
her
phrase
,
applying
it
to
himself
:
``
What
*NL*
am
I
to
do
?
''
The
instinct
of
the
celibate
warned
him
to
hold
back
.
But
*NL*
the
sin
was
there
;
even
his
sense
of
honour
told
him
that
reparation
*NL*
must
be
made
for
such
a
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
sitting
with
her
on
the
side
of
the
bed
Mary
came
to
the
*NL*
door
and
said
that
the
missus
wanted
to
see
him
in
the
parlour
.
He
stood
*NL*
up
to
put
on
his
coat
and
waistcoat
,
more
helpless
than
ever
.
When
he
*NL*
was
dressed
he
went
over
to
her
to
comfort
her
.
It
would
be
all
right
,
*NL*
never
fear
.
He
left
her
crying
on
the
bed
and
moaning
softly
:
``
O
my
*NL*
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Going
down
the
stairs
his
glasses
became
so
dimmed
with
moisture
that
*NL*
he
had
to
take
them
off
and
polish
them
.
He
longed
to
ascend
through
the
*NL*
roof
and
fly
away
to
another
country
where
he
would
never
hear
again
*NL*
of
his
trouble
,
and
yet
a
force
pushed
him
downstairs
step
by
step
.
*NL*
The
implacable
faces
of
his
employer
and
of
the
Madam
stared
upon
his
*NL*
discomfiture
.
On
the
last
flight
of
stairs
he
passed
Jack
Mooney
who
*NL*
was
coming
up
from
the
pantry
nursing
two
bottles
of
Bass
.
They
saluted
*NL*
coldly
;
and
the
lover
's
eyes
rested
for
a
second
or
two
on
a
thick
*NL*
bulldog
face
and
a
pair
of
thick
short
arms
.
When
he
reached
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
staircase
he
glanced
up
and
saw
Jack
regarding
him
from
the
door
of
*NL*
the
return-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
remembered
the
night
when
one
of
the
music-hall
artistes
,
*NL*
a
little
blond
Londoner
,
had
made
a
rather
free
allusion
to
Polly
.
*NL*
The
reunion
had
been
almost
broken
up
on
account
of
Jack
's
violence
.
*NL*
Everyone
tried
to
quiet
him
.
The
music-hall
artiste
,
a
little
paler
than
*NL*
usual
,
kept
smiling
and
saying
that
there
was
no
harm
meant
:
but
Jack
*NL*
kept
shouting
at
him
that
if
any
fellow
tried
that
sort
of
a
game
on
*NL*
with
his
sister
he
'd
bloody
well
put
his
teeth
down
his
throat
,
so
he
*NL*
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
Polly
sat
for
a
little
time
on
the
side
of
the
bed
,
crying
.
Then
she
*NL*
dried
her
eyes
and
went
over
to
the
looking-glass
.
She
dipped
the
end
of
*NL*
the
towel
in
the
water-jug
and
refreshed
her
eyes
with
the
cool
water
.
*NL*
She
looked
at
herself
in
profile
and
readjusted
a
hairpin
above
her
ear
.
*NL*
Then
she
went
back
to
the
bed
again
and
sat
at
the
foot
.
She
regarded
*NL*
the
pillows
for
a
long
time
and
the
sight
of
them
awakened
in
her
mind
*NL*
secret
,
amiable
memories
.
She
rested
the
nape
of
her
neck
against
the
*NL*
cool
iron
bed-rail
and
fell
into
a
reverie
.
There
was
no
longer
any
*NL*
perturbation
visible
on
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
on
patiently
,
almost
cheerfully
,
without
alarm
,
her
memories
*NL*
gradually
giving
place
to
hopes
and
visions
of
the
future
.
Her
hopes
and
*NL*
visions
were
so
intricate
that
she
no
longer
saw
the
white
pillows
*NL*
on
which
her
gaze
was
fixed
or
remembered
that
she
was
waiting
for
*NL*
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
she
heard
her
mother
calling
.
She
started
to
her
feet
and
ran
to
*NL*
the
banisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Polly
!
Polly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
mamma
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
down
,
dear
.
Mr.
Doran
wants
to
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
remembered
what
she
had
been
waiting
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
LITTLE
CLOUD
*NL*
*NL*
EIGHT
years
before
he
had
seen
his
friend
off
at
the
North
Wall
and
*NL*
wished
him
godspeed
.
Gallaher
had
got
on
.
You
could
tell
that
at
once
*NL*
by
his
travelled
air
,
his
well-cut
tweed
suit
,
and
fearless
accent
.
Few
*NL*
fellows
had
talents
like
his
and
fewer
still
could
remain
unspoiled
*NL*
by
such
success
.
Gallaher
's
heart
was
in
the
right
place
and
he
had
*NL*
deserved
to
win
.
It
was
something
to
have
a
friend
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
's
thoughts
ever
since
lunch-time
had
been
of
his
meeting
*NL*
with
Gallaher
,
of
Gallaher
's
invitation
and
of
the
great
city
London
*NL*
where
Gallaher
lived
.
He
was
called
Little
Chandler
because
,
though
*NL*
he
was
but
slightly
under
the
average
stature
,
he
gave
one
the
idea
*NL*
of
being
a
little
man
.
His
hands
were
white
and
small
,
his
frame
was
*NL*
fragile
,
his
voice
was
quiet
and
his
manners
were
refined
.
He
took
the
*NL*
greatest
care
of
his
fair
silken
hair
and
moustache
and
used
perfume
*NL*
discreetly
on
his
handkerchief
.
The
half-moons
of
his
nails
were
perfect
*NL*
and
when
he
smiled
you
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
row
of
childish
white
*NL*
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
King
's
Inns
he
thought
what
changes
those
*NL*
eight
years
had
brought
.
The
friend
whom
he
had
known
under
a
shabby
and
*NL*
necessitous
guise
had
become
a
brilliant
figure
on
the
London
Press
.
He
*NL*
turned
often
from
his
tiresome
writing
to
gaze
out
of
the
office
window
.
*NL*
The
glow
of
a
late
autumn
sunset
covered
the
grass
plots
and
walks
.
It
*NL*
cast
a
shower
of
kindly
golden
dust
on
the
untidy
nurses
and
decrepit
*NL*
old
men
who
drowsed
on
the
benches
;
it
flickered
upon
all
the
moving
*NL*
figures
--
on
the
children
who
ran
screaming
along
the
gravel
paths
and
*NL*
on
everyone
who
passed
through
the
gardens
.
He
watched
the
scene
and
*NL*
thought
of
life
;
and
-LRB-
as
always
happened
when
he
thought
of
life
-RRB-
he
*NL*
became
sad
.
A
gentle
melancholy
took
possession
of
him
.
He
felt
how
*NL*
useless
it
was
to
struggle
against
fortune
,
this
being
the
burden
of
*NL*
wisdom
which
the
ages
had
bequeathed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
the
books
of
poetry
upon
his
shelves
at
home
.
He
had
*NL*
bought
them
in
his
bachelor
days
and
many
an
evening
,
as
he
sat
in
the
*NL*
little
room
off
the
hall
,
he
had
been
tempted
to
take
one
down
from
the
*NL*
bookshelf
and
read
out
something
to
his
wife
.
But
shyness
had
always
*NL*
held
him
back
;
and
so
the
books
had
remained
on
their
shelves
.
At
times
*NL*
he
repeated
lines
to
himself
and
this
consoled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
hour
had
struck
he
stood
up
and
took
leave
of
his
desk
and
of
*NL*
his
fellow-clerks
punctiliously
.
He
emerged
from
under
the
feudal
*NL*
arch
of
the
King
's
Inns
,
a
neat
modest
figure
,
and
walked
swiftly
down
*NL*
Henrietta
Street
.
The
golden
sunset
was
waning
and
the
air
had
grown
*NL*
sharp
.
A
horde
of
grimy
children
populated
the
street
.
They
stood
or
*NL*
ran
in
the
roadway
or
crawled
up
the
steps
before
the
gaping
doors
or
*NL*
squatted
like
mice
upon
the
thresholds
.
Little
Chandler
gave
them
no
*NL*
thought
.
He
picked
his
way
deftly
through
all
that
minute
vermin-like
*NL*
life
and
under
the
shadow
of
the
gaunt
spectral
mansions
in
which
the
*NL*
old
nobility
of
Dublin
had
roystered
.
No
memory
of
the
past
touched
him
,
*NL*
for
his
mind
was
full
of
a
present
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
never
been
in
Corless
's
but
he
knew
the
value
of
the
name
.
He
*NL*
knew
that
people
went
there
after
the
theatre
to
eat
oysters
and
drink
*NL*
liqueurs
;
and
he
had
heard
that
the
waiters
there
spoke
French
and
*NL*
German
.
Walking
swiftly
by
at
night
he
had
seen
cabs
drawn
up
before
the
*NL*
door
and
richly
dressed
ladies
,
escorted
by
cavaliers
,
alight
and
*NL*
enter
quickly
.
They
wore
noisy
dresses
and
many
wraps
.
Their
faces
were
*NL*
powdered
and
they
caught
up
their
dresses
,
when
they
touched
earth
,
*NL*
like
alarmed
Atalantas
.
He
had
always
passed
without
turning
his
head
*NL*
to
look
.
It
was
his
habit
to
walk
swiftly
in
the
street
even
by
day
and
*NL*
whenever
he
found
himself
in
the
city
late
at
night
he
hurried
on
his
*NL*
way
apprehensively
and
excitedly
.
Sometimes
,
however
,
he
courted
the
*NL*
causes
of
his
fear
.
He
chose
the
darkest
and
narrowest
streets
and
,
*NL*
as
he
walked
boldly
forward
,
the
silence
that
was
spread
about
his
*NL*
footsteps
troubled
him
,
the
wandering
,
silent
figures
troubled
him
;
and
*NL*
at
times
a
sound
of
low
fugitive
laughter
made
him
tremble
like
a
leaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
the
right
towards
Capel
Street
.
Ignatius
Gallaher
on
the
*NL*
London
Press
!
Who
would
have
thought
it
possible
eight
years
before
?
*NL*
Still
,
now
that
he
reviewed
the
past
,
Little
Chandler
could
remember
*NL*
many
signs
of
future
greatness
in
his
friend
.
People
used
to
say
that
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
was
wild
.
Of
course
,
he
did
mix
with
a
rakish
set
of
*NL*
fellows
at
that
time
,
drank
freely
and
borrowed
money
on
all
sides
.
*NL*
In
the
end
he
had
got
mixed
up
in
some
shady
affair
,
some
money
*NL*
transaction
:
at
least
,
that
was
one
version
of
his
flight
.
But
nobody
*NL*
denied
him
talent
.
There
was
always
a
certain
...
something
in
Ignatius
*NL*
Gallaher
that
impressed
you
in
spite
of
yourself
.
Even
when
he
was
out
*NL*
at
elbows
and
at
his
wits
'
end
for
money
he
kept
up
a
bold
face

Little
*NL*
Chandler
remembered
-LRB-
and
the
remembrance
brought
a
slight
flush
of
pride
*NL*
to
his
cheek
-RRB-
one
of
Ignatius
Gallaher
's
sayings
when
he
was
in
a
tight
*NL*
corner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
time
now
,
boys
,
''
he
used
to
say
light-heartedly
.
``
Where
's
my
*NL*
considering
cap
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
Ignatius
Gallaher
all
out
;
and
,
damn
it
,
you
could
n't
but
*NL*
admire
him
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
quickened
his
pace
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
*NL*
felt
himself
superior
to
the
people
he
passed
.
For
the
first
time
his
*NL*
soul
revolted
against
the
dull
inelegance
of
Capel
Street
.
There
was
no
*NL*
doubt
about
it
:
if
you
wanted
to
succeed
you
had
to
go
away
.
You
could
*NL*
do
nothing
in
Dublin
.
As
he
crossed
Grattan
Bridge
he
looked
down
the
*NL*
river
towards
the
lower
quays
and
pitied
the
poor
stunted
houses
.
They
*NL*
seemed
to
him
a
band
of
tramps
,
huddled
together
along
the
riverbanks
,
*NL*
their
old
coats
covered
with
dust
and
soot
,
stupefied
by
the
panorama
*NL*
of
sunset
and
waiting
for
the
first
chill
of
night
bid
them
arise
,
shake
*NL*
themselves
and
begone
.
He
wondered
whether
he
could
write
a
poem
to
*NL*
express
his
idea
.
Perhaps
Gallaher
might
be
able
to
get
it
into
some
*NL*
London
paper
for
him
.
Could
he
write
something
original
?
He
was
not
sure
*NL*
what
idea
he
wished
to
express
but
the
thought
that
a
poetic
moment
had
*NL*
touched
him
took
life
within
him
like
an
infant
hope
.
He
stepped
onward
*NL*
bravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
step
brought
him
nearer
to
London
,
farther
from
his
own
sober
*NL*
inartistic
life
.
A
light
began
to
tremble
on
the
horizon
of
his
mind
.
He
*NL*
was
not
so
old
--
thirty-two
.
His
temperament
might
be
said
to
be
just
*NL*
at
the
point
of
maturity
.
There
were
so
many
different
moods
and
*NL*
impressions
that
he
wished
to
express
in
verse
.
He
felt
them
within
him
.
*NL*
He
tried
weigh
to
his
soul
to
see
if
it
was
a
poet
's
soul
.
Melancholy
*NL*
was
the
dominant
note
of
his
temperament
,
he
thought
,
but
it
was
a
*NL*
melancholy
tempered
by
recurrences
of
faith
and
resignation
and
simple
*NL*
joy
.
If
he
could
give
expression
to
it
in
a
book
of
poems
perhaps
men
*NL*
would
listen
.
He
would
never
be
popular
:
he
saw
that
.
He
could
not
sway
*NL*
the
crowd
but
he
might
appeal
to
a
little
circle
of
kindred
minds
.
*NL*
The
English
critics
,
perhaps
,
would
recognise
him
as
one
of
the
Celtic
*NL*
school
by
reason
of
the
melancholy
tone
of
his
poems
;
besides
that
,
he
*NL*
would
put
in
allusions
.
He
began
to
invent
sentences
and
phrases
from
*NL*
the
notice
which
his
book
would
get
.
``
Mr.
Chandler
has
the
gift
of
easy
*NL*
and
graceful
verse
.
''
...
``
wistful
sadness
pervades
these
poems
.
''
...
``
The
*NL*
Celtic
note
.
''
It
was
a
pity
his
name
was
not
more
Irish-looking
.
Perhaps
*NL*
it
would
be
better
to
insert
his
mother
's
name
before
the
surname
:
*NL*
Thomas
Malone
Chandler
,
or
better
still
:
T.
Malone
Chandler
.
He
would
*NL*
speak
to
Gallaher
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pursued
his
revery
so
ardently
that
he
passed
his
street
and
had
*NL*
to
turn
back
.
As
he
came
near
Corless
's
his
former
agitation
began
to
*NL*
overmaster
him
and
he
halted
before
the
door
in
indecision
.
Finally
he
*NL*
opened
the
door
and
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
and
noise
of
the
bar
held
him
at
the
doorways
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
.
He
looked
about
him
,
but
his
sight
was
confused
by
the
shining
*NL*
of
many
red
and
green
wine-glasses
The
bar
seemed
to
him
to
be
full
*NL*
of
people
and
he
felt
that
the
people
were
observing
him
curiously
.
He
*NL*
glanced
quickly
to
right
and
left
-LRB-
frowning
slightly
to
make
his
errand
*NL*
appear
serious
-RRB-
,
but
when
his
sight
cleared
a
little
he
saw
that
nobody
*NL*
had
turned
to
look
at
him
:
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
was
Ignatius
Gallaher
*NL*
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
counter
and
his
feet
planted
far
*NL*
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Tommy
,
old
hero
,
here
you
are
!
What
is
it
to
be
?
What
will
you
*NL*
have
?
I
'm
taking
whisky
:
better
stuff
than
we
get
across
the
water
.
*NL*
Soda
?
Lithia
?
No

I
'm
the
same

Spoils

Here

us
two
halves
of
malt
whisky

like
a
good

Well

*NL*
and
how
have
you
been
pulling
along
since
I
saw
you
last
?
Dear
God
,
*NL*
how
old
we
're
getting
!
Do
you
see
any
signs
of
aging
in
me
--
eh
,
what
?
A
*NL*
little
grey
and
thin
on
the
top
--
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
took
off
his
hat
and
displayed
a
large
closely
cropped
*NL*
head
.
His
face
was
heavy
,
pale
and
cleanshaven
.
His
eyes
,
which
were
of
*NL*
bluish
slate-colour
,
relieved
his
unhealthy
pallor
and
shone
out
plainly
*NL*
above
the
vivid
orange
tie
he
wore
.
Between
these
rival
features
the
*NL*
lips
appeared
very
long
and
shapeless
and
colourless
.
He
bent
his
head
*NL*
and
felt
with
two
sympathetic
fingers
the
thin
hair
at
the
crown
.
Little
*NL*
Chandler
shook
his
head
as
a
denial
.
Ignatius
Galaher
put
on
his
hat
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
pulls
you
down
,
''
he
said
.
``
Press

Always
hurry
and
scurry

always

have
*NL*
something
new

your
stuff

Damn

I

,
for

Say

*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
allowed
his
whisky
to
be
very
much
diluted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
what
's
good

said
Ignatius
Gallaher
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
drink
very
little

a

said
Little
Chandler
modestly
.
``
An

so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Ignatius

cheerfully
,
``

times

*NL*
*NL*
They
clinked
glasses
and
drank
the
toast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
some
of
the
old
gang

said
Ignatius
Gallaher

*NL*
*NL*
``
Other

said
Little
Chandler
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tommy

''
he
said
,
``
I
see
you
have

changed

lecture
me
on
Sunday
mornings
when
I
*NL*
had
a
sore
head
and
a
fur
on
my
tongue

You
'd
want
to
knock
about
a
bit
*NL*
in
the
world

Have

never

even
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
to
the
Isle

Little
Chandler
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius

laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Isle
of

he
said
.
``
Go

London

Paris

for
choice

do

*NL*
``
Have

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
it
really
so
beautiful
as
they
say
?
''
asked
Little
Chandler
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sipped
a
little
of
his
drink
while
Ignatius
Gallaher
finished
his
*NL*
boldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beautiful
?
''
said
Ignatius
Gallaher
,
pausing
on
the
word
and
on
the
*NL*
flavour
of
his
drink
.
``
It
's
not
so
beautiful
,
you
know
.
Of
course
,
it
is
*NL*
beautiful
...
But
it
's
the
life
of
Paris
;
that
's
the
thing
.
Ah
,
there
's
*NL*
no
city
like
Paris
for
gaiety
,
movement
,
excitement

*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
finished
his
whisky
and
,
after
some
trouble
,
succeeded
*NL*
in
catching
the
barman
's
eye
.
He
ordered
the
same
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
to
the
Moulin
Rouge
,
''
Ignatius
Gallaher
continued
when
the
*NL*
barman
had
removed
their
glasses
,
``
and
I
've
been
to
all
the
Bohemian
*NL*
cafes

Hot
stuff
!
Not
for
a
pious
chap
like
you
,
Tommy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
said
nothing
until
the
barman
returned
with
two
glasses
:
*NL*
then
he
touched
his
friend
's
glass
lightly
and
reciprocated
the
former
*NL*
toast
.
He
was
beginning
to
feel
somewhat
disillusioned
.
Gallaher
's
*NL*
accent
and
way
of
expressing
himself
did
not
please
him
.
There
was
*NL*
something
vulgar
in
his
friend
which
he
had
not
observed
before
.
But
*NL*
perhaps
it
was
only
the
result
of
living
in
London
amid
the
bustle
and
*NL*
competition
of
the
Press
.
The
old
personal
charm
was
still
there
under
*NL*
this
new
gaudy
manner
.
And
,
after
all
,
Gallaher
had
lived
,
he
had
seen
*NL*
the
world
.
Little
Chandler
looked
at
his
friend
enviously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
in
Paris
is
gay
,
''
said
Ignatius
Gallaher
.
``
They
believe
in
*NL*
enjoying
life

and
do
n't
you
think
they
're
right
?
If
you
want
to
enjoy
*NL*
yourself
properly
you
must
go
to
Paris

And
,
mind
you
,
they
've
a
great
*NL*
feeling
for
the
Irish
there
.
When
they
heard
I
was
from
Ireland
they
*NL*
were
ready
to
eat
me

man

*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
took
four
or
five
sips
from
his
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me

''
he
said
,
``
is
it
true
that
Paris
is
so
...
immoral
as
they
*NL*
say
?

*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
made
a
catholic
gesture
with
his
right
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
place
is
immoral

''
he
said
.
``
Of
course
you
do
find
spicy
bits
in
*NL*
Paris

Go
to
one
of
the
students

balls

for
instance
.
That
's
lively
,
if
*NL*
you
like
,
when
the
cocottes
begin
to
let
themselves
loose
.
You
know
what
*NL*
they
are
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
of
them

said
Little
Chandler
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
drank
off
his
whisky
and
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

''
he
said
,
``
you
may
say
what
you

Parisienne

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is

said
Little
Chandler
,
with
timid
*NL*
insistence
--
``

with

Dublin

Ignatius
Gallaher

showed
him
a
bit
about

Will

*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
produced
his
cigar-case
.
The
two
friends
lit
their
*NL*
cigars
and
puffed
at
them
in
silence
until
their
drinks
were
served
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
my
opinion

said
Ignatius
Gallaher
,
emerging
after
some
*NL*
time
from
the
clouds
of
smoke
in
which
he
had
taken
refuge
,
``
it
's
a
rum
*NL*
world
.
Talk
of
immorality
!
I
've
heard
of
cases
--
what
am
I
saying
?
--
I
've
*NL*
known
them
:
cases
of

immorality

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
puffed
thoughtfully
at
his
cigar
and
then
,
in
a
calm
*NL*
historian
's
tone
,
he
proceeded
to
sketch
for
his
friend
some
pictures
*NL*
of
the
corruption
which
was
rife
abroad
.
He
summarised
the
vices
of
many
*NL*
capitals
and
seemed
inclined
to
award
the
palm
to
Berlin
.
Some
things
he
*NL*
could
not
vouch
for
-LRB-
his
friends
had
told
him
-RRB-
,
but
of
others
he
had
had
*NL*
personal
experience
.
He
spared
neither
rank
nor
caste
.
He
revealed
many
*NL*
of
the
secrets
of
religious
houses
on
the
Continent
and
described
some
*NL*
of
the
practices
which
were
fashionable
in
high
society
and
ended
by
*NL*
telling
,
with
details
,
a
story
about
an
English
duchess
--
a
story
which
*NL*
he
knew
to
be
true
.
Little
Chandler
was
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well

Ignatius
Gallaher
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dull
you
must
find
it
,
''
said
Little
Chandler
,
``
after
all
the
other
*NL*
places
you
've
seen

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,

said
Ignatius
Gallaher
,
``
it
's
a
relaxation
to
come
over
here

know

And

after
all

it

the
old
country

they
say

is
n't
it

*NL*
You
ca
n't
help
having
a
certain
feeling
for
it
.
That
's
human
nature

*NL*
But
tell
me
something
about
yourself

Hogan
told
me
you
had

tasted
*NL*
the
joys
of
connubial
bliss

Two
years
ago
,
was
n't
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
blushed
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
was
married
last
May
twelve
months

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
's
not

late
in

offer
my
best

*NL*
Ignatius

your

I
'd
have
done
so
at

*NL*
*NL*
He
extended
his
hand
,
which
Little
Chandler
took
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Tommy

he
said
,
``
I

you

you
never

shoot
you

And
*NL*
that

the

a
sincere

an
old
friend

You

that

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

Little

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any

Ignatius

*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
blushed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
one

he
said

*NL*
``
Son

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
slapped
his

sonorously
on
the
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo

he
said
,
``
I
would
n't

you

*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
smiled
,
looked
confusedly
at
his
glass
and
bit
his
lower
*NL*
lip
with
three
childishly
white
front
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
'll
spend
an
evening
with

he
said
,
``
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks

Ignatius

I

*NL*
``
Tonight

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

You
see
I
'm
over
here
with
another

fellow

clever
young
chap
he
is
too
,
and
we
arranged
to
go

Only
for
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
O

in

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
knows
?

said
Ignatius
Gallaher
considerately
.
``
Next
year
I
may
*NL*
take
a
little
skip
over
here
now
that
I
've
broken
the
ice

It
's
only
a
*NL*
pleasure
deferred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Little
Chandler
,
``
the
next
time
you
come
we
must
have
*NL*
an
evening
together

That
's
agreed

n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
agreed

said
Ignatius
Gallaher
.
``
Next
year
if
I
come
,
*NL*
parole
d'honneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
clinch
the
bargain
,
''
said
Little
Chandler
,
``
we
'll
just
have
one
*NL*
more
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
took
out
a
large
gold
watch
and
looked
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
to
be
the
last
?
''
he
said
.
``
Because
you
know
,
I
have
an
a.p.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
yes
,
positively
,
''
said
Little
Chandler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
''
said
Ignatius
Gallaher
,
``
let
us
have
another
one
as
a
*NL*
deoc
an
doruis
--
that
's
good
vernacular
for
a
small
whisky
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
ordered
the
drinks
.
The
blush
which
had
risen
to
his
*NL*
face
a
few
moments
before
was
establishing
itself
.
A
trifle
made
*NL*
him
blush
at
any
time
:
and
now
he
felt
warm
and
excited
.
Three
small
*NL*
whiskies
had
gone
to
his
head
and
Gallaher
's
strong
cigar
had
confused
*NL*
his
mind
,
for
he
was
a
delicate
and
abstinent
person
.
The
adventure
of
*NL*
meeting
Gallaher
after
eight
years
,
of
finding
himself
with
Gallaher
*NL*
in
Corless
's
surrounded
by
lights
and
noise
,
of
listening
to
Gallaher
's
*NL*
stories
and
of
sharing
for
a
brief
space
Gallaher
's
vagrant
and
*NL*
triumphant
life
,
upset
the
equipoise
of
his
sensitive
nature
.
He
felt
*NL*
acutely
the
contrast
between
his
own
life
and
his
friend
's
and
it
seemed
*NL*
to
him
unjust
.
Gallaher
was
his
inferior
in
birth
and
education
.
He
was
*NL*
sure
that
he
could
do
something
better
than
his
friend
had
ever
done
,
or
*NL*
could
ever
do
,
something
higher
than
mere
tawdry
journalism
if
he
only
*NL*
got
the
chance
.
What
was
it
that
stood
in
his
way
?
His
unfortunate
*NL*
timidity
!
He
wished
to
vindicate
himself
in
some
way
,
to
assert
his
*NL*
manhood
.
He
saw
behind
Gallaher
's
refusal
of
his
invitation
.
Gallaher
*NL*
was
only
patronising
him
by
his
friendliness
just
as
he
was
patronising
*NL*
Ireland
by
his
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barman
brought
their
drinks
.
Little
Chandler
pushed
one
glass
*NL*
towards
his
friend
and
took
up
the
other
boldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
knows
?
''
he
said
,
as
they
lifted
their
glasses
.
``
When
you
come
next
*NL*
year
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
wishing
long
life
and
happiness
to
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Ignatius
Gallaher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
in
the
act
of
drinking
closed
one
eye
expressively
*NL*
over
the
rim
of
his
glass
.
When
he
had
drunk
he
smacked
his
lips
*NL*
decisively
,
set
down
his
glass
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
blooming
fear
of
that
,
my
boy
.
I
'm
going
to
have
my
fling
first
and
*NL*
see
a
bit
of
life
and
the
world
before
I
put
my
head
in
the
sack
--
if
I
*NL*
ever
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
day
you
will
,
''
said
Little
Chandler
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ignatius
Gallaher
turned
his
orange
tie
and
slate-blue
eyes
full
upon
*NL*
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
so
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
put
your
head
in
the
sack
,
''
repeated
Little
Chandler
stoutly
,
*NL*
``
like
everyone
else
if
you
can
find
the
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
slightly
emphasised
his
tone
and
he
was
aware
that
he
had
*NL*
betrayed
himself
;
but
,
though
the
colour
had
heightened
in
his
cheek
,
he
*NL*
did
not
flinch
from
his
friend
's
gaze
.
Ignatius
Gallaher
watched
him
for
*NL*
a
few
moments
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
ever
it
occurs
,
you
may
bet
your
bottom
dollar
there
'll
be
no
*NL*
mooning
and
spooning
about
it
.
I
mean
to
marry
money
.
She
'll
have
a
good
*NL*
fat
account
at
the
bank
or
she
wo
n't
do
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
man
alive
,
''
said
Ignatius
Gallaher
,
vehemently
,
``
do
you
know
what
*NL*
it
is
?
I
've
only
to
say
the
word
and
tomorrow
I
can
have
the
woman
*NL*
and
the
cash
.
You
do
n't
believe
it
?
Well
,
I
know
it
.
There
are
*NL*
hundreds
--
what
am
I
saying
?
--
thousands
of
rich
Germans
and
Jews
,
rotten
*NL*
with
money
,
that
'd
only
be
too
glad
...
You
wait
a
while
my
boy
.
See
if
*NL*
I
do
n't
play
my
cards
properly
.
When
I
go
about
a
thing
I
mean
business
,
*NL*
I
tell
you
.
You
just
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tossed
his
glass
to
his
mouth
,
finished
his
drink
and
laughed
loudly
.
*NL*
Then
he
looked
thoughtfully
before
him
and
said
in
a
calmer
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'm
in
no
hurry
.
They
can
wait
.
I
do
n't
fancy
tying
myself
up
to
*NL*
one
woman
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
imitated
with
his
mouth
the
act
of
tasting
and
made
a
wry
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
get
a
bit
stale
,
I
should
think
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
sat
in
the
room
off
the
hall
,
holding
a
child
in
his
*NL*
arms
.
To
save
money
they
kept
no
servant
but
Annie
's
young
sister
Monica
*NL*
came
for
an
hour
or
so
in
the
morning
and
an
hour
or
so
in
the
evening
*NL*
to
help
.
But
Monica
had
gone
home
long
ago
.
It
was
a
quarter
to
nine
.
*NL*
Little
Chandler
had
come
home
late
for
tea
and
,
moreover
,
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
to
bring
Annie
home
the
parcel
of
coffee
from
Bewley
's
.
Of
*NL*
course
she
was
in
a
bad
humour
and
gave
him
short
answers
.
She
said
she
*NL*
would
do
without
any
tea
but
when
it
came
near
the
time
at
which
the
*NL*
shop
at
the
corner
closed
she
decided
to
go
out
herself
for
a
quarter
*NL*
of
a
pound
of
tea
and
two
pounds
of
sugar
.
She
put
the
sleeping
child
*NL*
deftly
in
his
arms
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
.
Do
n't
waken
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
lamp
with
a
white
china
shade
stood
upon
the
table
and
its
*NL*
light
fell
over
a
photograph
which
was
enclosed
in
a
frame
of
crumpled
*NL*
horn
.
It
was
Annie
's
photograph
.
Little
Chandler
looked
at
it
,
pausing
*NL*
at
the
thin
tight
lips
.
She
wore
the
pale
blue
summer
blouse
which
he
*NL*
had
brought
her
home
as
a
present
one
Saturday
.
It
had
cost
him
ten
and
*NL*
elevenpence
;
but
what
an
agony
of
nervousness
it
had
cost
him
!
How
*NL*
he
had
suffered
that
day
,
waiting
at
the
shop
door
until
the
shop
was
*NL*
empty
,
standing
at
the
counter
and
trying
to
appear
at
his
ease
while
*NL*
the
girl
piled
ladies
'
blouses
before
him
,
paying
at
the
desk
and
*NL*
forgetting
to
take
up
the
odd
penny
of
his
change
,
being
called
back
by
*NL*
the
cashier
,
and
finally
,
striving
to
hide
his
blushes
as
he
left
the
*NL*
shop
by
examining
the
parcel
to
see
if
it
was
securely
tied
.
When
he
*NL*
brought
the
blouse
home
Annie
kissed
him
and
said
it
was
very
pretty
and
*NL*
stylish
;
but
when
she
heard
the
price
she
threw
the
blouse
on
the
table
*NL*
and
said
it
was
a
regular
swindle
to
charge
ten
and
elevenpence
for
it
.
*NL*
At
first
she
wanted
to
take
it
back
but
when
she
tried
it
on
she
was
*NL*
delighted
with
it
,
especially
with
the
make
of
the
sleeves
,
and
kissed
*NL*
him
and
said
he
was
very
good
to
think
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hm
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
coldly
into
the
eyes
of
the
photograph
and
they
answered
*NL*
coldly
.
Certainly
they
were
pretty
and
the
face
itself
was
pretty
.
But
*NL*
he
found
something
mean
in
it
.
Why
was
it
so
unconscious
and
ladylike
?
*NL*
The
composure
of
the
eyes
irritated
him
.
They
repelled
him
and
defied
*NL*
him
:
there
was
no
passion
in
them
,
no
rapture
.
He
thought
of
what
*NL*
Gallaher
had
said
about
rich
Jewesses
.
Those
dark
Oriental
eyes
,
he
*NL*
thought
,
how
full
they
are
of
passion
,
of
voluptuous
longing
!
...
Why
had
*NL*
he
married
the
eyes
in
the
photograph
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
caught
himself
up
at
the
question
and
glanced
nervously
round
the
*NL*
room
.
He
found
something
mean
in
the
pretty
furniture
which
he
had
*NL*
bought
for
his
house
on
the
hire
system
.
Annie
had
chosen
it
herself
*NL*
and
it
reminded
him
of
her
.
It
too
was
prim
and
pretty
.
A
dull
resentment
*NL*
against
his
life
awoke
within
him
.
Could
he
not
escape
from
his
little
*NL*
house
?
Was
it
too
late
for
him
to
try
to
live
bravely
like
Gallaher
?
*NL*
Could
he
go
to
London
?
There
was
the
furniture
still
to
be
paid
for
.
If
*NL*
he
could
only
write
a
book
and
get
it
published
,
that
might
open
the
way
*NL*
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
volume
of
Byron
's
poems
lay
before
him
on
the
table
.
He
opened
it
*NL*
cautiously
with
his
left
hand
lest
he
should
waken
the
child
and
began
*NL*
to
read
the
first
poem
in
the
book
:
*NL*
*NL*
Hushed
are
the
winds
and
still
the
evening
gloom
,
*NL*
Not
e
`
en
a
Zephyr
wanders
through
the
grove
,
*NL*
Whilst
I
return
to
view
my
Margaret
's
tomb
*NL*
And
scatter
flowers
on
the
dust
I
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
.
He
felt
the
rhythm
of
the
verse
about
him
in
the
room
.
*NL*
How
melancholy
it
was
!
Could
he
,
too
,
write
like
that
,
express
the
*NL*
melancholy
of
his
soul
in
verse
?
There
were
so
many
things
he
wanted
*NL*
to
describe
:
his
sensation
of
a
few
hours
before
on
Grattan
Bridge
,
for
*NL*
example
.
If
he
could
get
back
again
into
that
mood
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
awoke
and
began
to
cry
.
He
turned
from
the
page
and
tried
to
*NL*
hush
it
:
but
it
would
not
be
hushed
.
He
began
to
rock
it
to
and
fro
in
*NL*
his
arms
but
its
wailing
cry
grew
keener
.
He
rocked
it
faster
while
his
*NL*
eyes
began
to
read
the
second
stanza
:
*NL*
*NL*
Within
this
narrow
cell
reclines
her
clay
,
*NL*
That
clay
where
once
...
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
useless
.
He
could
n't
read
.
He
could
n't
do
anything
.
The
wailing
*NL*
of
the
child
pierced
the
drum
of
his
ear
.
It
was
useless
,
useless
!
*NL*
He
was
a
prisoner
for
life
.
His
arms
trembled
with
anger
and
suddenly
*NL*
bending
to
the
child
's
face
he
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
stopped
for
an
instant
,
had
a
spasm
of
fright
and
began
to
*NL*
scream
.
He
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
walked
hastily
up
and
down
the
*NL*
room
with
the
child
in
his
arms
.
It
began
to
sob
piteously
,
losing
its
*NL*
breath
for
four
or
five
seconds
,
and
then
bursting
out
anew
.
The
thin
*NL*
walls
of
the
room
echoed
the
sound
.
He
tried
to
soothe
it
but
it
sobbed
*NL*
more
convulsively
.
He
looked
at
the
contracted
and
quivering
face
of
*NL*
the
child
and
began
to
be
alarmed
.
He
counted
seven
sobs
without
a
*NL*
break
between
them
and
caught
the
child
to
his
breast
in
fright
.
If
it
*NL*
died
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
burst
open
and
a
young
woman
ran
in
,
panting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
What
is
it
?
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
,
hearing
its
mother
's
voice
,
broke
out
into
a
paroxysm
of
*NL*
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
Annie
...
it
's
nothing
...
He
began
to
cry
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
flung
her
parcels
on
the
floor
and
snatched
the
child
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
to
him
?
''
she
cried
,
glaring
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
sustained
for
one
moment
the
gaze
of
her
eyes
and
his
*NL*
heart
closed
together
as
he
met
the
hatred
in
them
.
He
began
to
stammer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
...
He
...
he
began
to
cry
...
I
could
n't
...
I
did
n't
do
*NL*
anything
...
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Giving
no
heed
to
him
she
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
clasping
*NL*
the
child
tightly
in
her
arms
and
murmuring
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
man
!
My
little
mannie
!
Was
`
ou
frightened
,
love
?
...
There
*NL*
now
,
love
!
There
now
!
...
Lambabaun
!
Mamma
's
little
lamb
of
the
world
!
...
*NL*
There
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Chandler
felt
his
cheeks
suffused
with
shame
and
he
stood
back
*NL*
out
of
the
lamplight
.
He
listened
while
the
paroxysm
of
the
child
's
*NL*
sobbing
grew
less
and
less
;
and
tears
of
remorse
started
to
his
eyes
.

COUNTERPARTS
*NL*
*NL*
THE
bell
rang
furiously
and
,
when
Miss
Parker
went
to
the
tube
,
a
*NL*
furious
voice
called
out
in
a
piercing
North
of
Ireland
accent
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
Farrington
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Parker
returned
to
her
machine
,
saying
to
a
man
who
was
writing
at
*NL*
a
desk
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Alleyne
wants
you
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
muttered
``
Blast
him
!
''
under
his
breath
and
pushed
back
his
chair
*NL*
to
stand
up
.
When
he
stood
up
he
was
tall
and
of
great
bulk
.
He
had
a
*NL*
hanging
face
,
dark
wine-coloured
,
with
fair
eyebrows
and
moustache
:
*NL*
his
eyes
bulged
forward
slightly
and
the
whites
of
them
were
dirty
.
*NL*
He
lifted
up
the
counter
and
,
passing
by
the
clients
,
went
out
of
the
*NL*
office
with
a
heavy
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
heavily
upstairs
until
he
came
to
the
second
landing
,
where
*NL*
a
door
bore
a
brass
plate
with
the
inscription
Mr.
Alleyne
.
Here
he
*NL*
halted
,
puffing
with
labour
and
vexation
,
and
knocked
.
The
shrill
voice
*NL*
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
entered
Mr.
Alleyne
's
room
.
Simultaneously
Mr.
Alleyne
,
a
little
*NL*
man
wearing
gold-rimmed
glasses
on
a
cleanshaven
face
,
shot
his
head
up
*NL*
over
a
pile
of
documents
.
The
head
itself
was
so
pink
and
hairless
it
*NL*
seemed
like
a
large
egg
reposing
on
the
papers
.
Mr.
Alleyne
did
not
lose
*NL*
a
moment
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farrington
?
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
Why
have
I
always
to
complain
*NL*
of
you
?
May
I
ask
you
why
you
have
n't
made
a
copy
of
that
contract
*NL*
between
Bodley
and
Kirwan
?
I
told
you
it
must
be
ready
by
four
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mr.
Shelley
said
,
sir
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Shelley
said
,
sir
...
Kindly
attend
to
what
I
say
and
not
to
*NL*
what
Mr.
Shelley
says
,
sir
.
You
have
always
some
excuse
or
another
for
*NL*
shirking
work
.
Let
me
tell
you
that
if
the
contract
is
not
copied
before
*NL*
this
evening
I
'll
lay
the
matter
before
Mr.
Crosbie
...
Do
you
hear
me
*NL*
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
me
now
?
...
Ay
and
another
little
matter
!
I
might
as
well
be
*NL*
talking
to
the
wall
as
talking
to
you
.
Understand
once
for
all
that
you
*NL*
get
a
half
an
hour
for
your
lunch
and
not
an
hour
and
a
half
.
How
many
*NL*
courses
do
you
want
,
I
'd
like
to
know
...
Do
you
mind
me
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Alleyne
bent
his
head
again
upon
his
pile
of
papers
.
The
man
stared
*NL*
fixedly
at
the
polished
skull
which
directed
the
affairs
of
Crosbie
&
*NL*
Alleyne
,
gauging
its
fragility
.
A
spasm
of
rage
gripped
his
throat
for
*NL*
a
few
moments
and
then
passed
,
leaving
after
it
a
sharp
sensation
of
*NL*
thirst
.
The
man
recognised
the
sensation
and
felt
that
he
must
have
a
*NL*
good
night
's
drinking
.
The
middle
of
the
month
was
passed
and
,
if
he
*NL*
could
get
the
copy
done
in
time
,
Mr.
Alleyne
might
give
him
an
order
on
*NL*
the
cashier
.
He
stood
still
,
gazing
fixedly
at
the
head
upon
the
pile
*NL*
of
papers
.
Suddenly
Mr.
Alleyne
began
to
upset
all
the
papers
,
searching
*NL*
for
something
.
Then
,
as
if
he
had
been
unaware
of
the
man
's
presence
*NL*
till
that
moment
,
he
shot
up
his
head
again
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
Are
you
going
to
stand
there
all
day
?
Upon
my
word
,
Farrington
,
you
*NL*
take
things
easy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
waiting
to
see
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
you
need
n't
wait
to
see
.
Go
downstairs
and
do
your
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
walked
heavily
towards
the
door
and
,
as
he
went
out
of
the
room
,
*NL*
he
heard
Mr.
Alleyne
cry
after
him
that
if
the
contract
was
not
copied
*NL*
by
evening
Mr.
Crosbie
would
hear
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
his
desk
in
the
lower
office
and
counted
the
sheets
which
*NL*
remained
to
be
copied
.
He
took
up
his
pen
and
dipped
it
in
the
ink
but
*NL*
he
continued
to
stare
stupidly
at
the
last
words
he
had
written
:
In
no
*NL*
case
shall
the
said
Bernard
Bodley
be
...
The
evening
was
falling
and
in
*NL*
a
few
minutes
they
would
be
lighting
the
gas
:
then
he
could
write
.
He
*NL*
felt
that
he
must
slake
the
thirst
in
his
throat
.
He
stood
up
from
his
*NL*
desk
and
,
lifting
the
counter
as
before
,
passed
out
of
the
office
.
As
he
*NL*
was
passing
out
the
chief
clerk
looked
at
him
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
Mr.
Shelley
,
''
said
the
man
,
pointing
with
his
finger
to
*NL*
indicate
the
objective
of
his
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
clerk
glanced
at
the
hat-rack
,
but
,
seeing
the
row
complete
,
*NL*
offered
no
remark
.
As
soon
as
he
was
on
the
landing
the
man
pulled
*NL*
a
shepherd
's
plaid
cap
out
of
his
pocket
,
put
it
on
his
head
and
ran
*NL*
quickly
down
the
rickety
stairs
.
From
the
street
door
he
walked
on
*NL*
furtively
on
the
inner
side
of
the
path
towards
the
corner
and
all
at
*NL*
once
dived
into
a
doorway
.
He
was
now
safe
in
the
dark
snug
of
O'Neill
's
*NL*
shop
,
and
filling
up
the
little
window
that
looked
into
the
bar
with
his
*NL*
inflamed
face
,
the
colour
of
dark
wine
or
dark
meat
,
he
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Pat
,
give
us
a
g.p.
,
like
a
good
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
curate
brought
him
a
glass
of
plain
porter
.
The
man
drank
it
at
a
*NL*
gulp
and
asked
for
a
caraway
seed
.
He
put
his
penny
on
the
counter
and
,
*NL*
leaving
the
curate
to
grope
for
it
in
the
gloom
,
retreated
out
of
the
*NL*
snug
as
furtively
as
he
had
entered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darkness
,
accompanied
by
a
thick
fog
,
was
gaining
upon
the
dusk
of
*NL*
February
and
the
lamps
in
Eustace
Street
had
been
lit
.
The
man
went
up
*NL*
by
the
houses
until
he
reached
the
door
of
the
office
,
wondering
whether
*NL*
he
could
finish
his
copy
in
time
.
On
the
stairs
a
moist
pungent
odour
of
*NL*
perfumes
saluted
his
nose
:
evidently
Miss
Delacour
had
come
while
he
*NL*
was
out
in
O'Neill
's
.
He
crammed
his
cap
back
again
into
his
pocket
and
*NL*
re-entered
the
office
,
assuming
an
air
of
absentmindedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Alleyne
has
been
calling
for
you
,
''
said
the
chief
clerk
severely
.
*NL*
``
Where
were
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
glanced
at
the
two
clients
who
were
standing
at
the
counter
as
*NL*
if
to
intimate
that
their
presence
prevented
him
from
answering
.
As
the
*NL*
clients
were
both
male
the
chief
clerk
allowed
himself
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
game
,
''
he
said
.
``
Five
times
in
one
day
is
a
little
bit
...
*NL*
Well
,
you
better
look
sharp
and
get
a
copy
of
our
correspondence
in
the
*NL*
Delacour
case
for
Mr.
Alleyne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
address
in
the
presence
of
the
public
,
his
run
upstairs
and
the
*NL*
porter
he
had
gulped
down
so
hastily
confused
the
man
and
,
as
he
sat
*NL*
down
at
his
desk
to
get
what
was
required
,
he
realised
how
hopeless
was
*NL*
the
task
of
finishing
his
copy
of
the
contract
before
half
past
five
.
*NL*
The
dark
damp
night
was
coming
and
he
longed
to
spend
it
in
the
bars
,
*NL*
drinking
with
his
friends
amid
the
glare
of
gas
and
the
clatter
of
*NL*
glasses
.
He
got
out
the
Delacour
correspondence
and
passed
out
of
*NL*
the
office
.
He
hoped
Mr.
Alleyne
would
not
discover
that
the
last
two
*NL*
letters
were
missing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moist
pungent
perfume
lay
all
the
way
up
to
Mr.
Alleyne
's
room
.
Miss
*NL*
Delacour
was
a
middle-aged
woman
of
Jewish
appearance
.
Mr.
Alleyne
was
*NL*
said
to
be
sweet
on
her
or
on
her
money
.
She
came
to
the
office
often
*NL*
and
stayed
a
long
time
when
she
came
.
She
was
sitting
beside
his
desk
*NL*
now
in
an
aroma
of
perfumes
,
smoothing
the
handle
of
her
umbrella
and
*NL*
nodding
the
great
black
feather
in
her
hat
.
Mr.
Alleyne
had
swivelled
*NL*
his
chair
round
to
face
her
and
thrown
his
right
foot
jauntily
upon
*NL*
his
left
knee
.
The
man
put
the
correspondence
on
the
desk
and
bowed
*NL*
respectfully
but
neither
Mr.
Alleyne
nor
Miss
Delacour
took
any
notice
*NL*
of
his
bow
.
Mr.
Alleyne
tapped
a
finger
on
the
correspondence
and
then
*NL*
flicked
it
towards
him
as
if
to
say
:
``
That
's
all
right
:
you
can
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
returned
to
the
lower
office
and
sat
down
again
at
his
desk
.
*NL*
He
stared
intently
at
the
incomplete
phrase
:
In
no
case
shall
the
said
*NL*
Bernard
Bodley
be
...
and
thought
how
strange
it
was
that
the
last
three
*NL*
words
began
with
the
same
letter
.
The
chief
clerk
began
to
hurry
Miss
*NL*
Parker
,
saying
she
would
never
have
the
letters
typed
in
time
for
post
.
*NL*
The
man
listened
to
the
clicking
of
the
machine
for
a
few
minutes
and
*NL*
then
set
to
work
to
finish
his
copy
.
But
his
head
was
not
clear
and
his
*NL*
mind
wandered
away
to
the
glare
and
rattle
of
the
public-house
.
It
was
a
*NL*
night
for
hot
punches
.
He
struggled
on
with
his
copy
,
but
when
the
clock
*NL*
struck
five
he
had
still
fourteen
pages
to
write
.
Blast
it
!
He
could
n't
*NL*
finish
it
in
time
.
He
longed
to
execrate
aloud
,
to
bring
his
fist
down
*NL*
on
something
violently
.
He
was
so
enraged
that
he
wrote
Bernard
Bernard
*NL*
instead
of
Bernard
Bodley
and
had
to
begin
again
on
a
clean
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
strong
enough
to
clear
out
the
whole
office
singlehanded
.
His
*NL*
body
ached
to
do
something
,
to
rush
out
and
revel
in
violence
.
All
*NL*
the
indignities
of
his
life
enraged
him
...
Could
he
ask
the
cashier
*NL*
privately
for
an
advance
?
No
,
the
cashier
was
no
good
,
no
damn
good
:
*NL*
he
would
n't
give
an
advance
...
He
knew
where
he
would
meet
the
boys
:
*NL*
Leonard
and
O'Halloran
and
Nosey
Flynn
.
The
barometer
of
his
emotional
*NL*
nature
was
set
for
a
spell
of
riot
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
imagination
had
so
abstracted
him
that
his
name
was
called
twice
*NL*
before
he
answered
.
Mr.
Alleyne
and
Miss
Delacour
were
standing
outside
*NL*
the
counter
and
all
the
clerks
had
turn
round
in
anticipation
of
*NL*
something
.
The
man
got
up
from
his
desk
.
Mr.
Alleyne
began
a
tirade
of
*NL*
abuse
,
saying
that
two
letters
were
missing
.
The
man
answered
that
he
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
them
,
that
he
had
made
a
faithful
copy
.
The
tirade
*NL*
continued
:
it
was
so
bitter
and
violent
that
the
man
could
hardly
*NL*
restrain
his
fist
from
descending
upon
the
head
of
the
manikin
before
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
any
other
two
letters
,
''
he
said
stupidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
--
know
--
nothing
.
Of
course
you
know
nothing
,
''
said
Mr.
Alleyne
.
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
he
added
,
glancing
first
for
approval
to
the
lady
beside
him
,
*NL*
``
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
?
Do
you
think
me
an
utter
fool
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
glanced
from
the
lady
's
face
to
the
little
egg-shaped
head
and
*NL*
back
again
;
and
,
almost
before
he
was
aware
of
it
,
his
tongue
had
found
*NL*
a
felicitous
moment
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
that
's
a
fair
question
to
put
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
in
the
very
breathing
of
the
clerks
.
Everyone
was
*NL*
astounded
-LRB-
the
author
of
the
witticism
no
less
than
his
neighbours
-RRB-
and
*NL*
Miss
Delacour
,
who
was
a
stout
amiable
person
,
began
to
smile
broadly
.
*NL*
Mr.
Alleyne
flushed
to
the
hue
of
a
wild
rose
and
his
mouth
twitched
*NL*
with
a
dwarf
's
passion
.
He
shook
his
fist
in
the
man
's
face
till
it
*NL*
seemed
to
vibrate
like
the
knob
of
some
electric
machine
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
impertinent
ruffian
!
You
impertinent
ruffian
!
I
'll
make
short
work
*NL*
of
you
!
Wait
till
you
see
!
You
'll
apologise
to
me
for
your
impertinence
*NL*
or
you
'll
quit
the
office
instanter
!
You
'll
quit
this
,
I
'm
telling
you
,
*NL*
or
you
'll
apologise
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
in
a
doorway
opposite
the
office
watching
to
see
if
the
cashier
*NL*
would
come
out
alone
.
All
the
clerks
passed
out
and
finally
the
cashier
*NL*
came
out
with
the
chief
clerk
.
It
was
no
use
trying
to
say
a
word
to
him
*NL*
when
he
was
with
the
chief
clerk
.
The
man
felt
that
his
position
was
bad
*NL*
enough
.
He
had
been
obliged
to
offer
an
abject
apology
to
Mr.
Alleyne
*NL*
for
his
impertinence
but
he
knew
what
a
hornet
's
nest
the
office
would
*NL*
be
for
him
.
He
could
remember
the
way
in
which
Mr.
Alleyne
had
hounded
*NL*
little
Peake
out
of
the
office
in
order
to
make
room
for
his
own
nephew
.
*NL*
He
felt
savage
and
thirsty
and
revengeful
,
annoyed
with
himself
and
with
*NL*
everyone
else
.
Mr.
Alleyne
would
never
give
him
an
hour
's
rest
;
his
life
*NL*
would
be
a
hell
to
him
.
He
had
made
a
proper
fool
of
himself
this
time
.
*NL*
Could
he
not
keep
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
?
But
they
had
never
pulled
*NL*
together
from
the
first
,
he
and
Mr.
Alleyne
,
ever
since
the
day
Mr.
*NL*
Alleyne
had
overheard
him
mimicking
his
North
of
Ireland
accent
to
amuse
*NL*
Higgins
and
Miss
Parker
:
that
had
been
the
beginning
of
it
.
He
might
*NL*
have
tried
Higgins
for
the
money
,
but
sure
Higgins
never
had
anything
*NL*
for
himself
.
A
man
with
two
establishments
to
keep
up
,
of
course
he
*NL*
could
n't
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
his
great
body
again
aching
for
the
comfort
of
the
public-house
.
*NL*
The
fog
had
begun
to
chill
him
and
he
wondered
could
he
touch
Pat
in
*NL*
O'Neill
's
.
He
could
not
touch
him
for
more
than
a
bob
--
and
a
bob
was
*NL*
no
use
.
Yet
he
must
get
money
somewhere
or
other
:
he
had
spent
his
*NL*
last
penny
for
the
g.p.
and
soon
it
would
be
too
late
for
getting
money
*NL*
anywhere
.
Suddenly
,
as
he
was
fingering
his
watch-chain
,
he
thought
of
*NL*
Terry
Kelly
's
pawn-office
in
Fleet
Street
.
That
was
the
dart
!
Why
did
n't
*NL*
he
think
of
it
sooner
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
through
the
narrow
alley
of
Temple
Bar
quickly
,
muttering
to
*NL*
himself
that
they
could
all
go
to
hell
because
he
was
going
to
have
*NL*
a
good
night
of
it
.
The
clerk
in
Terry
Kelly
's
said
A
crown
!
but
the
*NL*
consignor
held
out
for
six
shillings
;
and
in
the
end
the
six
shillings
*NL*
was
allowed
him
literally
.
He
came
out
of
the
pawn-office
joyfully
,
*NL*
making
a
little
cylinder
,
of
the
coins
between
his
thumb
and
fingers
.
In
*NL*
Westmoreland
Street
the
footpaths
were
crowded
with
young
men
and
women
*NL*
returning
from
business
and
ragged
urchins
ran
here
and
there
yelling
*NL*
out
the
names
of
the
evening
editions
.
The
man
passed
through
the
crowd
,
*NL*
looking
on
the
spectacle
generally
with
proud
satisfaction
and
staring
*NL*
masterfully
at
the
office-girls
.
His
head
was
full
of
the
noises
of
*NL*
tram-gongs
and
swishing
trolleys
and
his
nose
already
sniffed
the
*NL*
curling
fumes
of
punch
.
As
he
walked
on
he
preconsidered
the
terms
in
which
*NL*
he
would
narrate
the
incident
to
the
boys
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
I
just
looked
at
him
--
coolly
,
you
know
,
and
looked
at
her
.
Then
I
*NL*
looked
back
at
him
again
--
taking
my
time
,
you
know
.
'
I
do
n't
think
that
*NL*
that
's
a
fair
question
to
put
to
me
,
'
says
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nosey
Flynn
was
sitting
up
in
his
usual
corner
of
Davy
Byrne
's
and
,
when
*NL*
he
heard
the
story
,
he
stood
Farrington
a
half-one
,
saying
it
was
as
*NL*
smart
a
thing
as
ever
he
heard
.
Farrington
stood
a
drink
in
his
turn
.
*NL*
After
a
while
O'Halloran
and
Paddy
Leonard
came
in
and
the
story
was
*NL*
repeated
to
them
.
O'Halloran
stood
tailors
of
malt
,
hot
,
all
round
and
*NL*
told
the
story
of
the
retort
he
had
made
to
the
chief
clerk
when
he
was
*NL*
in
Callan
's
of
Fownes
's
Street
;
but
,
as
the
retort
was
after
the
manner
*NL*
of
the
liberal
shepherds
in
the
eclogues
,
he
had
to
admit
that
it
was
*NL*
not
as
clever
as
Farrington
's
retort
.
At
this
Farrington
told
the
boys
*NL*
to
polish
off
that
and
have
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
they
were
naming
their
poisons
who
should
come
in
but
Higgins
!
*NL*
Of
course
he
had
to
join
in
with
the
others
.
The
men
asked
him
to
give
*NL*
his
version
of
it
,
and
he
did
so
with
great
vivacity
for
the
sight
of
*NL*
five
small
hot
whiskies
was
very
exhilarating
.
Everyone
roared
*NL*
laughing
when
he
showed
the
way
in
which
Mr.
Alleyne
shook
his
fist
in
*NL*
Farrington
's
face
.
Then
he
imitated
Farrington
,
saying
,
``
And
here
was
my
*NL*
nabs
,
as
cool
as
you
please
,
''
while
Farrington
looked
at
the
company
out
*NL*
of
his
heavy
dirty
eyes
,
smiling
and
at
times
drawing
forth
stray
drops
*NL*
of
liquor
from
his
moustache
with
the
aid
of
his
lower
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
that
round
was
over
there
was
a
pause
.
O'Halloran
had
money
but
*NL*
neither
of
the
other
two
seemed
to
have
any
;
so
the
whole
party
left
*NL*
the
shop
somewhat
regretfully
.
At
the
corner
of
Duke
Street
Higgins
and
*NL*
Nosey
Flynn
bevelled
off
to
the
left
while
the
other
three
turned
back
*NL*
towards
the
city
.
Rain
was
drizzling
down
on
the
cold
streets
and
,
when
*NL*
they
reached
the
Ballast
Office
,
Farrington
suggested
the
Scotch
House
.
*NL*
The
bar
was
full
of
men
and
loud
with
the
noise
of
tongues
and
glasses
.
*NL*
The
three
men
pushed
past
the
whining
match-sellers
at
the
door
and
*NL*
formed
a
little
party
at
the
corner
of
the
counter
.
They
began
to
*NL*
exchange
stories
.
Leonard
introduced
them
to
a
young
fellow
named
*NL*
Weathers
who
was
performing
at
the
Tivoli
as
an
acrobat
and
knockabout
*NL*
artiste
.
Farrington
stood
a
drink
all
round
.
Weathers
said
he
would
take
*NL*
a
small
Irish
and
Apollinaris
.
Farrington
,
who
had
definite
notions
of
*NL*
what
was
what
,
asked
the
boys
would
they
have
an
Apollinaris
too
;
*NL*
but
the
boys
told
Tim
to
make
theirs
hot
.
The
talk
became
theatrical
.
*NL*
O'Halloran
stood
a
round
and
then
Farrington
stood
another
round
,
*NL*
Weathers
protesting
that
the
hospitality
was
too
Irish
.
He
promised
to
*NL*
get
them
in
behind
the
scenes
and
introduce
them
to
some
nice
girls
.
*NL*
O'Halloran
said
that
he
and
Leonard
would
go
,
but
that
Farrington
*NL*
would
n't
go
because
he
was
a
married
man
;
and
Farrington
's
heavy
dirty
*NL*
eyes
leered
at
the
company
in
token
that
he
understood
he
was
being
*NL*
chaffed
.
Weathers
made
them
all
have
just
one
little
tincture
at
his
*NL*
expense
and
promised
to
meet
them
later
on
at
Mulligan
's
in
Poolbeg
*NL*
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Scotch
House
closed
they
went
round
to
Mulligan
's
.
They
went
*NL*
into
the
parlour
at
the
back
and
O'Halloran
ordered
small
hot
specials
*NL*
all
round
.
They
were
all
beginning
to
feel
mellow
.
Farrington
was
just
*NL*
standing
another
round
when
Weathers
came
back
.
Much
to
Farrington
's
*NL*
relief
he
drank
a
glass
of
bitter
this
time
.
Funds
were
getting
low
but
*NL*
they
had
enough
to
keep
them
going
.
Presently
two
young
women
with
big
*NL*
hats
and
a
young
man
in
a
check
suit
came
in
and
sat
at
a
table
close
*NL*
by
.
Weathers
saluted
them
and
told
the
company
that
they
were
out
of
the
*NL*
Tivoli
.
Farrington
's
eyes
wandered
at
every
moment
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
one
of
the
young
women
.
There
was
something
striking
in
her
appearance
.
*NL*
An
immense
scarf
of
peacock-blue
muslin
was
wound
round
her
hat
and
*NL*
knotted
in
a
great
bow
under
her
chin
;
and
she
wore
bright
yellow
*NL*
gloves
,
reaching
to
the
elbow
.
Farrington
gazed
admiringly
at
the
plump
*NL*
arm
which
she
moved
very
often
and
with
much
grace
;
and
when
,
after
a
*NL*
little
time
,
she
answered
his
gaze
he
admired
still
more
her
large
dark
*NL*
brown
eyes
.
The
oblique
staring
expression
in
them
fascinated
him
.
She
*NL*
glanced
at
him
once
or
twice
and
,
when
the
party
was
leaving
the
room
,
*NL*
she
brushed
against
his
chair
and
said
``
O
,
pardon
!
''
in
a
London
accent
.
*NL*
He
watched
her
leave
the
room
in
the
hope
that
she
would
look
back
at
*NL*
him
,
but
he
was
disappointed
.
He
cursed
his
want
of
money
and
cursed
all
*NL*
the
rounds
he
had
stood
,
particularly
all
the
whiskies
and
Apolinaris
*NL*
which
he
had
stood
to
Weathers
.
If
there
was
one
thing
that
he
hated
it
*NL*
was
a
sponge
.
He
was
so
angry
that
he
lost
count
of
the
conversation
of
*NL*
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Paddy
Leonard
called
him
he
found
that
they
were
talking
about
*NL*
feats
of
strength
.
Weathers
was
showing
his
biceps
muscle
to
the
company
*NL*
and
boasting
so
much
that
the
other
two
had
called
on
Farrington
to
*NL*
uphold
the
national
honour
.
Farrington
pulled
up
his
sleeve
accordingly
*NL*
and
showed
his
biceps
muscle
to
the
company
.
The
two
arms
were
examined
*NL*
and
compared
and
finally
it
was
agreed
to
have
a
trial
of
strength
.
The
*NL*
table
was
cleared
and
the
two
men
rested
their
elbows
on
it
,
clasping
*NL*
hands
.
When
Paddy
Leonard
said
``
Go
!
''
each
was
to
try
to
bring
down
*NL*
the
other
's
hand
on
to
the
table
.
Farrington
looked
very
serious
and
*NL*
determined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trial
began
.
After
about
thirty
seconds
Weathers
brought
his
*NL*
opponent
's
hand
slowly
down
on
to
the
table
.
Farrington
's
dark
*NL*
wine-coloured
face
flushed
darker
still
with
anger
and
humiliation
at
*NL*
having
been
defeated
by
such
a
stripling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
to
put
the
weight
of
your
body
behind
it
.
Play
fair
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
not
playing
fair
?
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
again
.
The
two
best
out
of
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trial
began
again
.
The
veins
stood
out
on
Farrington
's
forehead
,
*NL*
and
the
pallor
of
Weathers
'
complexion
changed
to
peony
.
Their
hands
*NL*
and
arms
trembled
under
the
stress
.
After
a
long
struggle
Weathers
again
*NL*
brought
his
opponent
's
hand
slowly
on
to
the
table
.
There
was
a
murmur
*NL*
of
applause
from
the
spectators
.
The
curate
,
who
was
standing
beside
*NL*
the
table
,
nodded
his
red
head
towards
the
victor
and
said
with
stupid
*NL*
familiarity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
that
's
the
knack
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
hell
do
you
know
about
it
?
''
said
Farrington
fiercely
,
turning
*NL*
on
the
man
.
``
What
do
you
put
in
your
gab
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sh
,
sh
!
''
said
O'Halloran
,
observing
the
violent
expression
of
*NL*
Farrington
's
face
.
``
Pony
up
,
boys
.
We
'll
have
just
one
little
smahan
*NL*
more
and
then
we
'll
be
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
sullen-faced
man
stood
at
the
corner
of
O'Connell
Bridge
*NL*
waiting
for
the
little
Sandymount
tram
to
take
him
home
.
He
was
full
*NL*
of
smouldering
anger
and
revengefulness
.
He
felt
humiliated
and
*NL*
discontented
;
he
did
not
even
feel
drunk
;
and
he
had
only
twopence
in
*NL*
his
pocket
.
He
cursed
everything
.
He
had
done
for
himself
in
the
office
,
*NL*
pawned
his
watch
,
spent
all
his
money
;
and
he
had
not
even
got
drunk
.
*NL*
He
began
to
feel
thirsty
again
and
he
longed
to
be
back
again
in
the
hot
*NL*
reeking
public-house
.
He
had
lost
his
reputation
as
a
strong
man
,
having
*NL*
been
defeated
twice
by
a
mere
boy
.
His
heart
swelled
with
fury
and
,
when
*NL*
he
thought
of
the
woman
in
the
big
hat
who
had
brushed
against
him
and
*NL*
said
Pardon
!
his
fury
nearly
choked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tram
let
him
down
at
Shelbourne
Road
and
he
steered
his
great
body
*NL*
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
of
the
barracks
.
He
loathed
returning
*NL*
to
his
home
.
When
he
went
in
by
the
side-door
he
found
the
kitchen
empty
*NL*
and
the
kitchen
fire
nearly
out
.
He
bawled
upstairs
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ada
!
Ada
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
was
a
little
sharp-faced
woman
who
bullied
her
husband
when
*NL*
he
was
sober
and
was
bullied
by
him
when
he
was
drunk
.
They
had
five
*NL*
children
.
A
little
boy
came
running
down
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
?
''
said
the
man
,
peering
through
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
,
pa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
Charlie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
pa
.
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
your
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
out
at
the
chapel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
...
Did
she
think
of
leaving
any
dinner
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
pa
.
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Light
the
lamp
.
What
do
you
mean
by
having
the
place
in
darkness
?
Are
*NL*
the
other
children
in
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
sat
down
heavily
on
one
of
the
chairs
while
the
little
boy
*NL*
lit
the
lamp
.
He
began
to
mimic
his
son
's
flat
accent
,
saying
half
to
*NL*
himself
:
``
At
the
chapel
.
At
the
chapel
,
if
you
please
!
''
When
the
lamp
*NL*
was
lit
he
banged
his
fist
on
the
table
and
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
for
my
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
...
to
cook
it
,
pa
,
''
said
the
little
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
jumped
up
furiously
and
pointed
to
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
that
fire
!
You
let
the
fire
out
!
By
God
,
I
'll
teach
you
to
do
that
*NL*
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
step
to
the
door
and
seized
the
walking-stick
which
was
*NL*
standing
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
teach
you
to
let
the
fire
out
!
''
he
said
,
rolling
up
his
sleeve
in
*NL*
order
to
give
his
arm
free
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
boy
cried
``
O
,
pa
!
''
and
ran
whimpering
round
the
table
,
but
*NL*
the
man
followed
him
and
caught
him
by
the
coat
.
The
little
boy
looked
*NL*
about
him
wildly
but
,
seeing
no
way
of
escape
,
fell
upon
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
'll
let
the
fire
out
the
next
time
!
''
said
the
man
striking
at
*NL*
him
vigorously
with
the
stick
.
``
Take
that
,
you
little
whelp
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
uttered
a
squeal
of
pain
as
the
stick
cut
his
thigh
.
He
clasped
*NL*
his
hands
together
in
the
air
and
his
voice
shook
with
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
pa
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Do
n't
beat
me
,
pa
!
And
I
'll
...
I
'll
say
a
Hail
Mary
*NL*
for
you
...
I
'll
say
a
Hail
Mary
for
you
,
pa
,
if
you
do
n't
beat
me

*NL*
I
'll

a
Hail
Mary

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CLAY
*NL*
*NL*
THE
matron
had
given
her
leave
to
go
out
as
soon
as
the
women
's
tea
was
*NL*
over
and
Maria
looked
forward
to
her
evening
out
.
The
kitchen
was
*NL*
spick
and
span
:
the
cook
said
you
could
see
yourself
in
the
big
copper
*NL*
boilers
.
The
fire
was
nice
and
bright
and
on
one
of
the
side-tables
were
*NL*
four
very
big
barmbracks
.
These
barmbracks
seemed
uncut
;
but
if
you
went
*NL*
closer
you
would
see
that
they
had
been
cut
into
long
thick
even
slices
*NL*
and
were
ready
to
be
handed
round
at
tea
.
Maria
had
cut
them
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
was
a
very
,
very
small
person
indeed
but
she
had
a
very
long
*NL*
nose
and
a
very
long
chin
.
She
talked
a
little
through
her
nose
,
always
*NL*
soothingly
:
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
''
and
``
No
,
my
dear
.
''
She
was
always
sent
for
*NL*
when
the
women
quarrelled
over
their
tubs
and
always
succeeded
in
making
*NL*
peace
.
One
day
the
matron
had
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maria
,
you
are
a
veritable
peace-maker
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
sub-matron
and
two
of
the
Board
ladies
had
heard
the
compliment
.
*NL*
And
Ginger
Mooney
was
always
saying
what
she
would
n't
do
to
the
dummy
*NL*
who
had
charge
of
the
irons
if
it
was
n't
for
Maria
.
Everyone
was
so
fond
*NL*
of
Maria
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
would
have
their
tea
at
six
o'clock
and
she
would
be
able
to
*NL*
get
away
before
seven
.
From
Ballsbridge
to
the
Pillar
,
twenty
minutes
;
*NL*
from
the
Pillar
to
Drumcondra
,
twenty
minutes
;
and
twenty
minutes
to
buy
*NL*
the
things
.
She
would
be
there
before
eight
.
She
took
out
her
purse
with
*NL*
the
silver
clasps
and
read
again
the
words
A
Present
from
Belfast
.
She
*NL*
was
very
fond
of
that
purse
because
Joe
had
brought
it
to
her
five
years
*NL*
before
when
he
and
Alphy
had
gone
to
Belfast
on
a
Whit-Monday
trip
.
In
*NL*
the
purse
were
two
half-crowns
and
some
coppers
.
She
would
have
five
*NL*
shillings
clear
after
paying
tram
fare
.
What
a
nice
evening
they
would
*NL*
have
,
all
the
children
singing
!
Only
she
hoped
that
Joe
would
n't
come
in
*NL*
drunk
.
He
was
so
different
when
he
took
any
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
he
had
wanted
her
to
go
and
live
with
them
;
but
she
would
have
*NL*
felt
herself
in
the
way
-LRB-
though
Joe
's
wife
was
ever
so
nice
with
her
-RRB-
*NL*
and
she
had
become
accustomed
to
the
life
of
the
laundry
.
Joe
was
a
good
*NL*
fellow
.
She
had
nursed
him
and
Alphy
too
;
and
Joe
used
often
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
is
mamma
but
Maria
is
my
proper
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
break-up
at
home
the
boys
had
got
her
that
position
in
the
*NL*
Dublin
by
Lamplight
laundry
,
and
she
liked
it
.
She
used
to
have
such
*NL*
a
bad
opinion
of
Protestants
but
now
she
thought
they
were
very
nice
*NL*
people
,
a
little
quiet
and
serious
,
but
still
very
nice
people
to
live
*NL*
with
.
Then
she
had
her
plants
in
the
conservatory
and
she
liked
looking
*NL*
after
them
.
She
had
lovely
ferns
and
wax-plants
and
,
whenever
anyone
*NL*
came
to
visit
her
,
she
always
gave
the
visitor
one
or
two
slips
from
*NL*
her
conservatory
.
There
was
one
thing
she
did
n't
like
and
that
was
the
*NL*
tracts
on
the
walks
;
but
the
matron
was
such
a
nice
person
to
deal
with
,
*NL*
so
genteel
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
cook
told
her
everything
was
ready
she
went
into
the
women
's
*NL*
room
and
began
to
pull
the
big
bell
.
In
a
few
minutes
the
women
began
*NL*
to
come
in
by
twos
and
threes
,
wiping
their
steaming
hands
in
their
*NL*
petticoats
and
pulling
down
the
sleeves
of
their
blouses
over
their
red
*NL*
steaming
arms
.
They
settled
down
before
their
huge
mugs
which
the
cook
*NL*
and
the
dummy
filled
up
with
hot
tea
,
already
mixed
with
milk
and
sugar
*NL*
in
huge
tin
cans
.
Maria
superintended
the
distribution
of
the
barmbrack
*NL*
and
saw
that
every
woman
got
her
four
slices
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
laughing
and
joking
during
the
meal
.
Lizzie
Fleming
said
Maria
was
sure
*NL*
to
get
the
ring
and
,
though
Fleming
had
said
that
for
so
many
Hallow
*NL*
Eves
,
Maria
had
to
laugh
and
say
she
did
n't
want
any
ring
or
man
either
;
*NL*
and
when
she
laughed
her
grey-green
eyes
sparkled
with
disappointed
*NL*
shyness
and
the
tip
of
her
nose
nearly
met
the
tip
of
her
chin
.
Then
*NL*
Ginger
Mooney
lifted
her
mug
of
tea
and
proposed
Maria
's
health
while
*NL*
all
the
other
women
clattered
with
their
mugs
on
the
table
,
and
said
she
*NL*
was
sorry
she
had
n't
a
sup
of
porter
to
drink
it
in
.
And
Maria
laughed
*NL*
again
till
the
tip
of
her
nose
nearly
met
the
tip
of
her
chin
and
till
*NL*
her
minute
body
nearly
shook
itself
asunder
because
she
knew
that
Mooney
*NL*
meant
well
though
,
of
course
,
she
had
the
notions
of
a
common
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
was
n't
Maria
glad
when
the
women
had
finished
their
tea
and
the
cook
*NL*
and
the
dummy
had
begun
to
clear
away
the
tea-things
!
She
went
into
*NL*
her
little
bedroom
and
,
remembering
that
the
next
morning
was
a
mass
*NL*
morning
,
changed
the
hand
of
the
alarm
from
seven
to
six
.
Then
she
took
*NL*
off
her
working
skirt
and
her
house-boots
and
laid
her
best
skirt
out
on
*NL*
the
bed
and
her
tiny
dress-boots
beside
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
She
changed
*NL*
her
blouse
too
and
,
as
she
stood
before
the
mirror
,
she
thought
of
how
*NL*
she
used
to
dress
for
mass
on
Sunday
morning
when
she
was
a
young
girl
;
*NL*
and
she
looked
with
quaint
affection
at
the
diminutive
body
which
she
*NL*
had
so
often
adorned
.
In
spite
of
its
years
she
found
it
a
nice
tidy
*NL*
little
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
got
outside
the
streets
were
shining
with
rain
and
she
was
glad
*NL*
of
her
old
brown
waterproof
.
The
tram
was
full
and
she
had
to
sit
on
the
*NL*
little
stool
at
the
end
of
the
car
,
facing
all
the
people
,
with
her
toes
*NL*
barely
touching
the
floor
.
She
arranged
in
her
mind
all
she
was
going
to
*NL*
do
and
thought
how
much
better
it
was
to
be
independent
and
to
have
your
*NL*
own
money
in
your
pocket
.
She
hoped
they
would
have
a
nice
evening
.
She
*NL*
was
sure
they
would
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
what
a
pity
it
was
*NL*
Alphy
and
Joe
were
not
speaking
.
They
were
always
falling
out
now
but
*NL*
when
they
were
boys
together
they
used
to
be
the
best
of
friends
:
but
*NL*
such
was
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
out
of
her
tram
at
the
Pillar
and
ferreted
her
way
quickly
among
*NL*
the
crowds
.
She
went
into
Downes
's
cake-shop
but
the
shop
was
so
full
of
*NL*
people
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
get
herself
attended
*NL*
to
.
She
bought
a
dozen
of
mixed
penny
cakes
,
and
at
last
came
out
of
the
*NL*
shop
laden
with
a
big
bag
.
Then
she
thought
what
else
would
she
buy
:
she
*NL*
wanted
to
buy
something
really
nice
.
They
would
be
sure
to
have
plenty
*NL*
of
apples
and
nuts
.
It
was
hard
to
know
what
to
buy
and
all
she
could
*NL*
think
of
was
cake
.
She
decided
to
buy
some
plumcake
but
Downes
's
*NL*
plumcake
had
not
enough
almond
icing
on
top
of
it
so
she
went
over
to
*NL*
a
shop
in
Henry
Street
.
Here
she
was
a
long
time
in
suiting
herself
and
*NL*
the
stylish
young
lady
behind
the
counter
,
who
was
evidently
a
little
*NL*
annoyed
by
her
,
asked
her
was
it
wedding-cake
she
wanted
to
buy
.
That
*NL*
made
Maria
blush
and
smile
at
the
young
lady
;
but
the
young
lady
took
it
*NL*
all
very
seriously
and
finally
cut
a
thick
slice
of
plumcake
,
parcelled
*NL*
it
up
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two-and-four
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
she
would
have
to
stand
in
the
Drumcondra
tram
because
none
*NL*
of
the
young
men
seemed
to
notice
her
but
an
elderly
gentleman
made
room
*NL*
for
her
.
He
was
a
stout
gentleman
and
he
wore
a
brown
hard
hat
;
he
had
*NL*
a
square
red
face
and
a
greyish
moustache
.
Maria
thought
he
was
a
*NL*
colonel-looking
gentleman
and
she
reflected
how
much
more
polite
he
was
*NL*
than
the
young
men
who
simply
stared
straight
before
them
.
The
gentleman
*NL*
began
to
chat
with
her
about
Hallow
Eve
and
the
rainy
weather
.
He
*NL*
supposed
the
bag
was
full
of
good
things
for
the
little
ones
and
said
*NL*
it
was
only
right
that
the
youngsters
should
enjoy
themselves
while
they
*NL*
were
young
.
Maria
agreed
with
him
and
favoured
him
with
demure
nods
and
*NL*
hems
.
He
was
very
nice
with
her
,
and
when
she
was
getting
out
at
the
*NL*
Canal
Bridge
she
thanked
him
and
bowed
,
and
he
bowed
to
her
and
raised
*NL*
his
hat
and
smiled
agreeably
,
and
while
she
was
going
up
along
the
*NL*
terrace
,
bending
her
tiny
head
under
the
rain
,
she
thought
how
easy
it
*NL*
was
to
know
a
gentleman
even
when
he
has
a
drop
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
said
:
``
O
,
here
's
Maria
!
''
when
she
came
to
Joe
's
house
.
Joe
was
*NL*
there
,
having
come
home
from
business
,
and
all
the
children
had
their
*NL*
Sunday
dresses
on
.
There
were
two
big
girls
in
from
next
door
and
games
*NL*
were
going
on
.
Maria
gave
the
bag
of
cakes
to
the
eldest
boy
,
Alphy
,
to
*NL*
divide
and
Mrs.
Donnelly
said
it
was
too
good
of
her
to
bring
such
a
big
*NL*
bag
of
cakes
and
made
all
the
children
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
Maria
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Maria
said
she
had
brought
something
special
for
papa
and
mamma
,
*NL*
something
they
would
be
sure
to
like
,
and
she
began
to
look
for
her
*NL*
plumcake
.
She
tried
in
Downes
's
bag
and
then
in
the
pockets
of
her
*NL*
waterproof
and
then
on
the
hallstand
but
nowhere
could
she
find
it
.
*NL*
Then
she
asked
all
the
children
had
any
of
them
eaten
it
--
by
mistake
,
of
*NL*
course
--
but
the
children
all
said
no
and
looked
as
if
they
did
not
like
*NL*
to
eat
cakes
if
they
were
to
be
accused
of
stealing
.
Everybody
had
a
*NL*
solution
for
the
mystery
and
Mrs.
Donnelly
said
it
was
plain
that
Maria
*NL*
had
left
it
behind
her
in
the
tram
.
Maria
,
remembering
how
confused
the
*NL*
gentleman
with
the
greyish
moustache
had
made
her
,
coloured
with
shame
*NL*
and
vexation
and
disappointment
.
At
the
thought
of
the
failure
of
her
*NL*
little
surprise
and
of
the
two
and
fourpence
she
had
thrown
away
for
*NL*
nothing
she
nearly
cried
outright
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Joe
said
it
did
n't
matter
and
made
her
sit
down
by
the
fire
.
He
*NL*
was
very
nice
with
her
.
He
told
her
all
that
went
on
in
his
office
,
*NL*
repeating
for
her
a
smart
answer
which
he
had
made
to
the
manager
.
Maria
*NL*
did
not
understand
why
Joe
laughed
so
much
over
the
answer
he
had
made
*NL*
but
she
said
that
the
manager
must
have
been
a
very
overbearing
person
*NL*
to
deal
with
.
Joe
said
he
was
n't
so
bad
when
you
knew
how
to
take
him
,
*NL*
that
he
was
a
decent
sort
so
long
as
you
did
n't
rub
him
the
wrong
way
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Donnelly
played
the
piano
for
the
children
and
they
danced
and
*NL*
sang
.
Then
the
two
next-door
girls
handed
round
the
nuts
.
Nobody
could
*NL*
find
the
nutcrackers
and
Joe
was
nearly
getting
cross
over
it
and
asked
*NL*
how
did
they
expect
Maria
to
crack
nuts
without
a
nutcracker
.
But
Maria
*NL*
said
she
did
n't
like
nuts
and
that
they
were
n't
to
bother
about
her
.
*NL*
Then
Joe
asked
would
she
take
a
bottle
of
stout
and
Mrs.
Donnelly
said
*NL*
there
was
port
wine
too
in
the
house
if
she
would
prefer
that
.
Maria
*NL*
said
she
would
rather
they
did
n't
ask
her
to
take
anything
:
but
Joe
*NL*
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Maria
let
him
have
his
way
and
they
sat
by
the
fire
talking
over
old
*NL*
times
and
Maria
thought
she
would
put
in
a
good
word
for
Alphy
.
But
Joe
*NL*
cried
that
God
might
strike
him
stone
dead
if
ever
he
spoke
a
word
to
*NL*
his
brother
again
and
Maria
said
she
was
sorry
she
had
mentioned
the
*NL*
matter
.
Mrs.
Donnelly
told
her
husband
it
was
a
great
shame
for
him
to
*NL*
speak
that
way
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
but
Joe
said
that
Alphy
was
no
*NL*
brother
of
his
and
there
was
nearly
being
a
row
on
the
head
of
it
.
But
*NL*
Joe
said
he
would
not
lose
his
temper
on
account
of
the
night
it
was
*NL*
and
asked
his
wife
to
open
some
more
stout
.
The
two
next-door
girls
*NL*
had
arranged
some
Hallow
Eve
games
and
soon
everything
was
merry
again
.
*NL*
Maria
was
delighted
to
see
the
children
so
merry
and
Joe
and
his
wife
in
*NL*
such
good
spirits
.
The
next-door
girls
put
some
saucers
on
the
table
*NL*
and
then
led
the
children
up
to
the
table
,
blindfold
.
One
got
the
*NL*
prayer-book
and
the
other
three
got
the
water
;
and
when
one
of
the
*NL*
next-door
girls
got
the
ring
Mrs.
Donnelly
shook
her
finger
at
the
*NL*
blushing
girl
as
much
as
to
say
:
O
,
I
know
all
about
it
!
They
insisted
*NL*
then
on
blindfolding
Maria
and
leading
her
up
to
the
table
to
see
*NL*
what
she
would
get
;
and
,
while
they
were
putting
on
the
bandage
,
Maria
*NL*
laughed
and
laughed
again
till
the
tip
of
her
nose
nearly
met
the
tip
of
*NL*
her
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
led
her
up
to
the
table
amid
laughing
and
joking
and
she
put
her
*NL*
hand
out
in
the
air
as
she
was
told
to
do
.
She
moved
her
hand
about
here
*NL*
and
there
in
the
air
and
descended
on
one
of
the
saucers
.
She
felt
a
*NL*
soft
wet
substance
with
her
fingers
and
was
surprised
that
nobody
spoke
*NL*
or
took
off
her
bandage
.
There
was
a
pause
for
a
few
seconds
;
and
then
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
scuffling
and
whispering
.
Somebody
said
something
about
*NL*
the
garden
,
and
at
last
Mrs.
Donnelly
said
something
very
cross
to
one
*NL*
of
the
next-door
girls
and
told
her
to
throw
it
out
at
once
:
that
was
no
*NL*
play
.
Maria
understood
that
it
was
wrong
that
time
and
so
she
had
to
do
*NL*
it
over
again
:
and
this
time
she
got
the
prayer-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
Mrs.
Donnelly
played
Miss
McCloud
's
Reel
for
the
children
*NL*
and
Joe
made
Maria
take
a
glass
of
wine
.
Soon
they
were
all
quite
merry
*NL*
again
and
Mrs.
Donnelly
said
Maria
would
enter
a
convent
before
the
year
*NL*
was
out
because
she
had
got
the
prayer-book
.
Maria
had
never
seen
Joe
*NL*
so
nice
to
her
as
he
was
that
night
,
so
full
of
pleasant
talk
and
*NL*
reminiscences
.
She
said
they
were
all
very
good
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
children
grew
tired
and
sleepy
and
Joe
asked
Maria
would
she
*NL*
not
sing
some
little
song
before
she
went
,
one
of
the
old
songs
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Donnelly
said
``
Do
,
please
,
Maria
!
''
and
so
Maria
had
to
get
up
and
stand
*NL*
beside
the
piano
.
Mrs.
Donnelly
bade
the
children
be
quiet
and
listen
*NL*
to
Maria
's
song
.
Then
she
played
the
prelude
and
said
``
Now
,
Maria
!
''
and
*NL*
Maria
,
blushing
very
much
began
to
sing
in
a
tiny
quavering
voice
.
She
*NL*
sang
I
Dreamt
that
I
Dwelt
,
and
when
she
came
to
the
second
verse
she
*NL*
sang
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
dreamt
that
I
dwelt
in
marble
halls
*NL*
With
vassals
and
serfs
at
my
side
,
*NL*
And
of
all
who
assembled
within
those
walls
*NL*
That
I
was
the
hope
and
the
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
riches
too
great
to
count
;
could
boast
*NL*
Of
a
high
ancestral
name
,
*NL*
But
I
also
dreamt
,
which
pleased
me
most
,
*NL*
That
you
loved
me
still
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
one
tried
to
show
her
her
mistake
;
and
when
she
had
ended
her
*NL*
song
Joe
was
very
much
moved
.
He
said
that
there
was
no
time
like
the
*NL*
long
ago
and
no
music
for
him
like
poor
old
Balfe
,
whatever
other
people
*NL*
might
say
;
and
his
eyes
filled
up
so
much
with
tears
that
he
could
not
*NL*
find
what
he
was
looking
for
and
in
the
end
he
had
to
ask
his
wife
to
*NL*
tell
him
where
the
corkscrew
was
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
A
PAINFUL
CASE
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
JAMES
DUFFY
lived
in
Chapelizod
because
he
wished
to
live
as
far
as
*NL*
possible
from
the
city
of
which
he
was
a
citizen
and
because
he
found
*NL*
all
the
other
suburbs
of
Dublin
mean
,
modern
and
pretentious
.
He
lived
*NL*
in
an
old
sombre
house
and
from
his
windows
he
could
look
into
the
*NL*
disused
distillery
or
upwards
along
the
shallow
river
on
which
Dublin
is
*NL*
built
.
The
lofty
walls
of
his
uncarpeted
room
were
free
from
pictures
.
*NL*
He
had
himself
bought
every
article
of
furniture
in
the
room
:
a
black
*NL*
iron
bedstead
,
an
iron
washstand
,
four
cane
chairs
,
a
clothes-rack
,
*NL*
a
coal-scuttle
,
a
fender
and
irons
and
a
square
table
on
which
lay
a
*NL*
double
desk
.
A
bookcase
had
been
made
in
an
alcove
by
means
of
shelves
*NL*
of
white
wood
.
The
bed
was
clothed
with
white
bedclothes
and
a
black
*NL*
and
scarlet
rug
covered
the
foot
.
A
little
hand-mirror
hung
above
the
*NL*
washstand
and
during
the
day
a
white-shaded
lamp
stood
as
the
sole
*NL*
ornament
of
the
mantelpiece
.
The
books
on
the
white
wooden
shelves
were
*NL*
arranged
from
below
upwards
according
to
bulk
.
A
complete
Wordsworth
*NL*
stood
at
one
end
of
the
lowest
shelf
and
a
copy
of
the
Maynooth
*NL*
Catechism
,
sewn
into
the
cloth
cover
of
a
notebook
,
stood
at
one
end
of
*NL*
the
top
shelf
.
Writing
materials
were
always
on
the
desk
.
In
the
desk
*NL*
lay
a
manuscript
translation
of
Hauptmann
's
Michael
Kramer
,
the
stage
*NL*
directions
of
which
were
written
in
purple
ink
,
and
a
little
sheaf
of
*NL*
papers
held
together
by
a
brass
pin
.
In
these
sheets
a
sentence
was
*NL*
inscribed
from
time
to
time
and
,
in
an
ironical
moment
,
the
headline
of
*NL*
an
advertisement
for
Bile
Beans
had
been
pasted
on
to
the
first
sheet
.
*NL*
On
lifting
the
lid
of
the
desk
a
faint
fragrance
escaped
--
the
fragrance
*NL*
of
new
cedarwood
pencils
or
of
a
bottle
of
gum
or
of
an
overripe
apple
*NL*
which
might
have
been
left
there
and
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Duffy
abhorred
anything
which
betokened
physical
or
mental
disorder
.
*NL*
A
mediaeval
doctor
would
have
called
him
saturnine
.
His
face
,
which
*NL*
carried
the
entire
tale
of
his
years
,
was
of
the
brown
tint
of
Dublin
*NL*
streets
.
On
his
long
and
rather
large
head
grew
dry
black
hair
and
a
*NL*
tawny
moustache
did
not
quite
cover
an
unamiable
mouth
.
His
cheekbones
*NL*
also
gave
his
face
a
harsh
character
;
but
there
was
no
harshness
in
the
*NL*
eyes
which
,
looking
at
the
world
from
under
their
tawny
eyebrows
,
gave
*NL*
the
impression
of
a
man
ever
alert
to
greet
a
redeeming
instinct
in
*NL*
others
but
often
disappointed
.
He
lived
at
a
little
distance
from
his
*NL*
body
,
regarding
his
own
acts
with
doubtful
side-glances
.
He
had
an
odd
*NL*
autobiographical
habit
which
led
him
to
compose
in
his
mind
from
time
*NL*
to
time
a
short
sentence
about
himself
containing
a
subject
in
the
third
*NL*
person
and
a
predicate
in
the
past
tense
.
He
never
gave
alms
to
beggars
*NL*
and
walked
firmly
,
carrying
a
stout
hazel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
for
many
years
cashier
of
a
private
bank
in
Baggot
Street
.
*NL*
Every
morning
he
came
in
from
Chapelizod
by
tram
.
At
midday
he
went
*NL*
to
Dan
Burke
's
and
took
his
lunch
--
a
bottle
of
lager
beer
and
a
small
*NL*
trayful
of
arrowroot
biscuits
.
At
four
o'clock
he
was
set
free
.
He
dined
*NL*
in
an
eating-house
in
George
's
Street
where
he
felt
himself
safe
from
*NL*
the
society
of
Dublin
's
gilded
youth
and
where
there
was
a
certain
plain
*NL*
honesty
in
the
bill
of
fare
.
His
evenings
were
spent
either
before
his
*NL*
landlady
's
piano
or
roaming
about
the
outskirts
of
the
city
.
His
liking
*NL*
for
Mozart
's
music
brought
him
sometimes
to
an
opera
or
a
concert
:
these
*NL*
were
the
only
dissipations
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
neither
companions
nor
friends
,
church
nor
creed
.
He
lived
his
*NL*
spiritual
life
without
any
communion
with
others
,
visiting
his
relatives
*NL*
at
Christmas
and
escorting
them
to
the
cemetery
when
they
died
.
He
*NL*
performed
these
two
social
duties
for
old
dignity
's
sake
but
conceded
*NL*
nothing
further
to
the
conventions
which
regulate
the
civic
life
.
He
*NL*
allowed
himself
to
think
that
in
certain
circumstances
he
would
rob
*NL*
his
hank
but
,
as
these
circumstances
never
arose
,
his
life
rolled
out
*NL*
evenly
--
an
adventureless
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
he
found
himself
sitting
beside
two
ladies
in
the
Rotunda
.
*NL*
The
house
,
thinly
peopled
and
silent
,
gave
distressing
prophecy
of
*NL*
failure
.
The
lady
who
sat
next
him
looked
round
at
the
deserted
house
*NL*
once
or
twice
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
there
is
such
a
poor
house
tonight
!
It
's
so
hard
on
people
*NL*
to
have
to
sing
to
empty
benches
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
remark
as
an
invitation
to
talk
.
He
was
surprised
that
*NL*
she
seemed
so
little
awkward
.
While
they
talked
he
tried
to
fix
her
*NL*
permanently
in
his
memory
.
When
he
learned
that
the
young
girl
beside
*NL*
her
was
her
daughter
he
judged
her
to
be
a
year
or
so
younger
than
*NL*
himself
.
Her
face
,
which
must
have
been
handsome
,
had
remained
*NL*
intelligent
.
It
was
an
oval
face
with
strongly
marked
features
.
The
eyes
*NL*
were
very
dark
blue
and
steady
.
Their
gaze
began
with
a
defiant
note
*NL*
but
was
confused
by
what
seemed
a
deliberate
swoon
of
the
pupil
into
the
*NL*
iris
,
revealing
for
an
instant
a
temperament
of
great
sensibility
.
The
*NL*
pupil
reasserted
itself
quickly
,
this
half-disclosed
nature
fell
again
*NL*
under
the
reign
of
prudence
,
and
her
astrakhan
jacket
,
moulding
a
bosom
*NL*
of
a
certain
fullness
,
struck
the
note
of
defiance
more
definitely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
met
her
again
a
few
weeks
afterwards
at
a
concert
in
Earlsfort
*NL*
Terrace
and
seized
the
moments
when
her
daughter
's
attention
was
*NL*
diverted
to
become
intimate
.
She
alluded
once
or
twice
to
her
husband
*NL*
but
her
tone
was
not
such
as
to
make
the
allusion
a
warning
.
Her
name
*NL*
was
Mrs.
Sinico
.
Her
husband
's
great-great-grandfather
had
come
from
*NL*
Leghorn
.
Her
husband
was
captain
of
a
mercantile
boat
plying
between
*NL*
Dublin
and
Holland
;
and
they
had
one
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meeting
her
a
third
time
by
accident
he
found
courage
to
make
an
*NL*
appointment
.
She
came
.
This
was
the
first
of
many
meetings
;
they
met
*NL*
always
in
the
evening
and
chose
the
most
quiet
quarters
for
their
walks
*NL*
together
.
Mr.
Duffy
,
however
,
had
a
distaste
for
underhand
ways
and
,
*NL*
finding
that
they
were
compelled
to
meet
stealthily
,
he
forced
her
to
*NL*
ask
him
to
her
house
.
Captain
Sinico
encouraged
his
visits
,
thinking
*NL*
that
his
daughter
's
hand
was
in
question
.
He
had
dismissed
his
wife
so
*NL*
sincerely
from
his
gallery
of
pleasures
that
he
did
not
suspect
that
*NL*
anyone
else
would
take
an
interest
in
her
.
As
the
husband
was
often
*NL*
away
and
the
daughter
out
giving
music
lessons
Mr.
Duffy
had
many
*NL*
opportunities
of
enjoying
the
lady
's
society
.
Neither
he
nor
she
had
had
*NL*
any
such
adventure
before
and
neither
was
conscious
of
any
incongruity
.
*NL*
Little
by
little
he
entangled
his
thoughts
with
hers
.
He
lent
her
books
,
*NL*
provided
her
with
ideas
,
shared
his
intellectual
life
with
her
.
She
*NL*
listened
to
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
in
return
for
his
theories
she
gave
out
some
fact
of
her
own
*NL*
life
.
With
almost
maternal
solicitude
she
urged
him
to
let
his
nature
*NL*
open
to
the
full
:
she
became
his
confessor
.
He
told
her
that
for
some
*NL*
time
he
had
assisted
at
the
meetings
of
an
Irish
Socialist
Party
where
*NL*
he
had
felt
himself
a
unique
figure
amidst
a
score
of
sober
workmen
in
*NL*
a
garret
lit
by
an
inefficient
oil-lamp
.
When
the
party
had
divided
into
*NL*
three
sections
,
each
under
its
own
leader
and
in
its
own
garret
,
he
had
*NL*
discontinued
his
attendances
.
The
workmen
's
discussions
,
he
said
,
*NL*
were
too
timorous
;
the
interest
they
took
in
the
question
of
wages
was
*NL*
inordinate
.
He
felt
that
they
were
hard-featured
realists
and
that
they
*NL*
resented
an
exactitude
which
was
the
produce
of
a
leisure
not
within
*NL*
their
reach
.
No
social
revolution
,
he
told
her
,
would
be
likely
to
*NL*
strike
Dublin
for
some
centuries
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
him
why
did
he
not
write
out
his
thoughts
.
For
what
,
he
asked
*NL*
her
,
with
careful
scorn
.
To
compete
with
phrasemongers
,
incapable
of
*NL*
thinking
consecutively
for
sixty
seconds
?
To
submit
himself
to
the
*NL*
criticisms
of
an
obtuse
middle
class
which
entrusted
its
morality
to
*NL*
policemen
and
its
fine
arts
to
impresarios
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
often
to
her
little
cottage
outside
Dublin
;
often
they
spent
*NL*
their
evenings
alone
.
Little
by
little
,
as
their
thoughts
entangled
,
*NL*
they
spoke
of
subjects
less
remote
.
Her
companionship
was
like
a
warm
*NL*
soil
about
an
exotic
.
Many
times
she
allowed
the
dark
to
fall
upon
*NL*
them
,
refraining
from
lighting
the
lamp
.
The
dark
discreet
room
,
their
*NL*
isolation
,
the
music
that
still
vibrated
in
their
ears
united
them
.
*NL*
This
union
exalted
him
,
wore
away
the
rough
edges
of
his
character
,
*NL*
emotionalised
his
mental
life
.
Sometimes
he
caught
himself
listening
to
*NL*
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
.
He
thought
that
in
her
eyes
he
would
ascend
*NL*
to
an
angelical
stature
;
and
,
as
he
attached
the
fervent
nature
of
his
*NL*
companion
more
and
more
closely
to
him
,
he
heard
the
strange
impersonal
*NL*
voice
which
he
recognised
as
his
own
,
insisting
on
the
soul
's
incurable
*NL*
loneliness
.
We
can
not
give
ourselves
,
it
said
:
we
are
our
own
.
The
end
*NL*
of
these
discourses
was
that
one
night
during
which
she
had
shown
every
*NL*
sign
of
unusual
excitement
,
Mrs.
Sinico
caught
up
his
hand
passionately
*NL*
and
pressed
it
to
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Duffy
was
very
much
surprised
.
Her
interpretation
of
his
words
*NL*
disillusioned
him
.
He
did
not
visit
her
for
a
week
,
then
he
wrote
to
her
*NL*
asking
her
to
meet
him
.
As
he
did
not
wish
their
last
interview
to
be
*NL*
troubled
by
the
influence
of
their
ruined
confessional
they
met
in
a
*NL*
little
cakeshop
near
the
Parkgate
.
It
was
cold
autumn
weather
but
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
cold
they
wandered
up
and
down
the
roads
of
the
Park
for
*NL*
nearly
three
hours
.
They
agreed
to
break
off
their
intercourse
:
every
*NL*
bond
,
he
said
,
is
a
bond
to
sorrow
.
When
they
came
out
of
the
Park
they
*NL*
walked
in
silence
towards
the
tram
;
but
here
she
began
to
tremble
*NL*
so
violently
that
,
fearing
another
collapse
on
her
part
,
he
bade
her
*NL*
good-bye
quickly
and
left
her
.
A
few
days
later
he
received
a
parcel
*NL*
containing
his
books
and
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
years
passed
.
Mr.
Duffy
returned
to
his
even
way
of
life
.
His
room
*NL*
still
bore
witness
of
the
orderliness
of
his
mind
.
Some
new
pieces
of
*NL*
music
encumbered
the
music-stand
in
the
lower
room
and
on
his
shelves
*NL*
stood
two
volumes
by
Nietzsche
:
Thus
Spake
Zarathustra
and
The
Gay
*NL*
Science
.
He
wrote
seldom
in
the
sheaf
of
papers
which
lay
in
his
desk
.
*NL*
One
of
his
sentences
,
written
two
months
after
his
last
interview
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Sinico
,
read
:
Love
between
man
and
man
is
impossible
because
there
*NL*
must
not
be
sexual
intercourse
and
friendship
between
man
and
woman
is
*NL*
impossible
because
there
must
be
sexual
intercourse
.
He
kept
away
from
*NL*
concerts
lest
he
should
meet
her
.
His
father
died
;
the
junior
partner
of
*NL*
the
bank
retired
.
And
still
every
morning
he
went
into
the
city
by
*NL*
tram
and
every
evening
walked
home
from
the
city
after
having
dined
*NL*
moderately
in
George
's
Street
and
read
the
evening
paper
for
dessert
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
as
he
was
about
to
put
a
morsel
of
corned
beef
and
cabbage
*NL*
into
his
mouth
his
hand
stopped
.
His
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
a
*NL*
paragraph
in
the
evening
paper
which
he
had
propped
against
the
*NL*
water-carafe
.
He
replaced
the
morsel
of
food
on
his
plate
and
read
the
*NL*
paragraph
attentively
.
Then
he
drank
a
glass
of
water
,
pushed
his
plate
*NL*
to
one
side
,
doubled
the
paper
down
before
him
between
his
elbows
and
*NL*
read
the
paragraph
over
and
over
again
.
The
cabbage
began
to
deposit
a
*NL*
cold
white
grease
on
his
plate
.
The
girl
came
over
to
him
to
ask
was
*NL*
his
dinner
not
properly
cooked
.
He
said
it
was
very
good
and
ate
a
few
*NL*
mouthfuls
of
it
with
difficulty
.
Then
he
paid
his
bill
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
along
quickly
through
the
November
twilight
,
his
stout
hazel
*NL*
stick
striking
the
ground
regularly
,
the
fringe
of
the
buff
Mail
peeping
*NL*
out
of
a
side-pocket
of
his
tight
reefer
overcoat
.
On
the
lonely
road
*NL*
which
leads
from
the
Parkgate
to
Chapelizod
he
slackened
his
pace
.
*NL*
His
stick
struck
the
ground
less
emphatically
and
his
breath
,
issuing
*NL*
irregularly
,
almost
with
a
sighing
sound
,
condensed
in
the
wintry
air
.
*NL*
When
he
reached
his
house
he
went
up
at
once
to
his
bedroom
and
,
taking
*NL*
the
paper
from
his
pocket
,
read
the
paragraph
again
by
the
failing
light
*NL*
of
the
window
.
He
read
it
not
aloud
,
but
moving
his
lips
as
a
priest
*NL*
does
when
he
reads
the
prayers
Secreto
.
This
was
the
paragraph
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DEATH
OF
A
LADY
AT
SYDNEY
PARADE
*NL*
A
PAINFUL
CASE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Today
at
the
City
of
Dublin
Hospital
the
Deputy
Coroner
-LRB-
in
the
absence
*NL*
of
Mr.
Leverett
-RRB-
held
an
inquest
on
the
body
of
Mrs.
Emily
Sinico
,
aged
*NL*
forty-three
years
,
who
was
killed
at
Sydney
Parade
Station
yesterday
*NL*
evening
.
The
evidence
showed
that
the
deceased
lady
,
while
attempting
to
*NL*
cross
the
line
,
was
knocked
down
by
the
engine
of
the
ten
o'clock
slow
*NL*
train
from
Kingstown
,
thereby
sustaining
injuries
of
the
head
and
right
*NL*
side
which
led
to
her
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
James
Lennon
,
driver
of
the
engine
,
stated
that
he
had
been
in
the
*NL*
employment
of
the
railway
company
for
fifteen
years
.
On
hearing
*NL*
the
guard
's
whistle
he
set
the
train
in
motion
and
a
second
or
two
*NL*
afterwards
brought
it
to
rest
in
response
to
loud
cries
.
The
train
was
*NL*
going
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
P.
Dunne
,
railway
porter
,
stated
that
as
the
train
was
about
to
start
he
*NL*
observed
a
woman
attempting
to
cross
the
lines
.
He
ran
towards
her
and
*NL*
shouted
,
but
,
before
he
could
reach
her
,
she
was
caught
by
the
buffer
of
*NL*
the
engine
and
fell
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
juror
.
``
You
saw
the
lady
fall
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Witness
.
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Police
Sergeant
Croly
deposed
that
when
he
arrived
he
found
the
deceased
*NL*
lying
on
the
platform
apparently
dead
.
He
had
the
body
taken
to
the
*NL*
waiting-room
pending
the
arrival
of
the
ambulance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Constable
57E
corroborated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Halpin
,
assistant
house
surgeon
of
the
City
of
Dublin
Hospital
,
*NL*
stated
that
the
deceased
had
two
lower
ribs
fractured
and
had
sustained
*NL*
severe
contusions
of
the
right
shoulder
.
The
right
side
of
the
head
*NL*
had
been
injured
in
the
fall
.
The
injuries
were
not
sufficient
to
*NL*
have
caused
death
in
a
normal
person
.
Death
,
in
his
opinion
,
had
been
*NL*
probably
due
to
shock
and
sudden
failure
of
the
heart
's
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
H.
B.
Patterson
Finlay
,
on
behalf
of
the
railway
company
,
expressed
*NL*
his
deep
regret
at
the
accident
.
The
company
had
always
taken
every
*NL*
precaution
to
prevent
people
crossing
the
lines
except
by
the
bridges
,
*NL*
both
by
placing
notices
in
every
station
and
by
the
use
of
patent
spring
*NL*
gates
at
level
crossings
.
The
deceased
had
been
in
the
habit
of
crossing
*NL*
the
lines
late
at
night
from
platform
to
platform
and
,
in
view
of
*NL*
certain
other
circumstances
of
the
case
,
he
did
not
think
the
railway
*NL*
officials
were
to
blame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Sinico
,
of
Leoville
,
Sydney
Parade
,
husband
of
the
deceased
,
*NL*
also
gave
evidence
.
He
stated
that
the
deceased
was
his
wife
.
He
was
*NL*
not
in
Dublin
at
the
time
of
the
accident
as
he
had
arrived
only
that
*NL*
morning
from
Rotterdam
.
They
had
been
married
for
twenty-two
years
and
*NL*
had
lived
happily
until
about
two
years
ago
when
his
wife
began
to
be
*NL*
rather
intemperate
in
her
habits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mary
Sinico
said
that
of
late
her
mother
had
been
in
the
habit
*NL*
of
going
out
at
night
to
buy
spirits
.
She
,
witness
,
had
often
tried
to
*NL*
reason
with
her
mother
and
had
induced
her
to
join
a
league
.
She
was
not
*NL*
at
home
until
an
hour
after
the
accident
.
The
jury
returned
a
verdict
*NL*
in
accordance
with
the
medical
evidence
and
exonerated
Lennon
from
all
*NL*
blame
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Deputy
Coroner
said
it
was
a
most
painful
case
,
and
expressed
great
*NL*
sympathy
with
Captain
Sinico
and
his
daughter
.
He
urged
on
the
railway
*NL*
company
to
take
strong
measures
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
similar
*NL*
accidents
in
the
future
.
No
blame
attached
to
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Duffy
raised
his
eyes
from
the
paper
and
gazed
out
of
his
window
on
*NL*
the
cheerless
evening
landscape
.
The
river
lay
quiet
beside
the
empty
*NL*
distillery
and
from
time
to
time
a
light
appeared
in
some
house
on
the
*NL*
Lucan
road
.
What
an
end
!
The
whole
narrative
of
her
death
revolted
him
*NL*
and
it
revolted
him
to
think
that
he
had
ever
spoken
to
her
of
what
he
*NL*
held
sacred
.
The
threadbare
phrases
,
the
inane
expressions
of
sympathy
,
*NL*
the
cautious
words
of
a
reporter
won
over
to
conceal
the
details
of
*NL*
a
commonplace
vulgar
death
attacked
his
stomach
.
Not
merely
had
she
*NL*
degraded
herself
;
she
had
degraded
him
.
He
saw
the
squalid
tract
of
her
*NL*
vice
,
miserable
and
malodorous
.
His
soul
's
companion
!
He
thought
of
*NL*
the
hobbling
wretches
whom
he
had
seen
carrying
cans
and
bottles
to
*NL*
be
filled
by
the
barman
.
Just
God
,
what
an
end
!
Evidently
she
had
been
*NL*
unfit
to
live
,
without
any
strength
of
purpose
,
an
easy
prey
to
habits
,
*NL*
one
of
the
wrecks
on
which
civilisation
has
been
reared
.
But
that
she
*NL*
could
have
sunk
so
low
!
Was
it
possible
he
had
deceived
himself
*NL*
so
utterly
about
her
?
He
remembered
her
outburst
of
that
night
and
*NL*
interpreted
it
in
a
harsher
sense
than
he
had
ever
done
.
He
had
no
*NL*
difficulty
now
in
approving
of
the
course
he
had
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
light
failed
and
his
memory
began
to
wander
he
thought
her
hand
*NL*
touched
his
.
The
shock
which
had
first
attacked
his
stomach
was
now
*NL*
attacking
his
nerves
.
He
put
on
his
overcoat
and
hat
quickly
and
went
*NL*
out
.
The
cold
air
met
him
on
the
threshold
;
it
crept
into
the
sleeves
of
*NL*
his
coat
.
When
he
came
to
the
public-house
at
Chapelizod
Bridge
he
went
*NL*
in
and
ordered
a
hot
punch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
proprietor
served
him
obsequiously
but
did
not
venture
to
talk
.
*NL*
There
were
five
or
six
workingmen
in
the
shop
discussing
the
value
of
a
*NL*
gentleman
's
estate
in
County
Kildare
They
drank
at
intervals
from
their
*NL*
huge
pint
tumblers
and
smoked
,
spitting
often
on
the
floor
and
sometimes
*NL*
dragging
the
sawdust
over
their
spits
with
their
heavy
boots
.
Mr.
Duffy
*NL*
sat
on
his
stool
and
gazed
at
them
,
without
seeing
or
hearing
them
.
*NL*
After
a
while
they
went
out
and
he
called
for
another
punch
.
He
sat
a
*NL*
long
time
over
it
.
The
shop
was
very
quiet
.
The
proprietor
sprawled
on
*NL*
the
counter
reading
the
Herald
and
yawning
.
Now
and
again
a
tram
was
*NL*
heard
swishing
along
the
lonely
road
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
sat
there
,
living
over
his
life
with
her
and
evoking
alternately
*NL*
the
two
images
in
which
he
now
conceived
her
,
he
realised
that
she
was
*NL*
dead
,
that
she
had
ceased
to
exist
,
that
she
had
become
a
memory
.
He
*NL*
began
to
feel
ill
at
ease
.
He
asked
himself
what
else
could
he
have
*NL*
done
.
He
could
not
have
carried
on
a
comedy
of
deception
with
her
;
he
*NL*
could
not
have
lived
with
her
openly
.
He
had
done
what
seemed
to
him
*NL*
best
.
How
was
he
to
blame
?
Now
that
she
was
gone
he
understood
how
*NL*
lonely
her
life
must
have
been
,
sitting
night
after
night
alone
in
that
*NL*
room
.
His
life
would
be
lonely
too
until
he
,
too
,
died
,
ceased
to
exist
,
*NL*
became
a
memory
--
if
anyone
remembered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
nine
o'clock
when
he
left
the
shop
.
The
night
was
cold
and
*NL*
gloomy
.
He
entered
the
Park
by
the
first
gate
and
walked
along
under
the
*NL*
gaunt
trees
.
He
walked
through
the
bleak
alleys
where
they
had
walked
*NL*
four
years
before
.
She
seemed
to
be
near
him
in
the
darkness
.
At
moments
*NL*
he
seemed
to
feel
her
voice
touch
his
ear
,
her
hand
touch
his
.
He
stood
*NL*
still
to
listen
.
Why
had
he
withheld
life
from
her
?
Why
had
he
sentenced
*NL*
her
to
death
?
He
felt
his
moral
nature
falling
to
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
gained
the
crest
of
the
Magazine
Hill
he
halted
and
looked
*NL*
along
the
river
towards
Dublin
,
the
lights
of
which
burned
redly
and
*NL*
hospitably
in
the
cold
night
.
He
looked
down
the
slope
and
,
at
the
base
,
*NL*
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
of
the
Park
,
he
saw
some
human
figures
lying
.
*NL*
Those
venal
and
furtive
loves
filled
him
with
despair
.
He
gnawed
the
*NL*
rectitude
of
his
life
;
he
felt
that
he
had
been
outcast
from
life
's
*NL*
feast
.
One
human
being
had
seemed
to
love
him
and
he
had
denied
her
life
*NL*
and
happiness
:
he
had
sentenced
her
to
ignominy
,
a
death
of
shame
.
He
*NL*
knew
that
the
prostrate
creatures
down
by
the
wall
were
watching
him
and
*NL*
wished
him
gone
.
No
one
wanted
him
;
he
was
outcast
from
life
's
feast
.
*NL*
He
turned
his
eyes
to
the
grey
gleaming
river
,
winding
along
towards
*NL*
Dublin
.
Beyond
the
river
he
saw
a
goods
train
winding
out
of
Kingsbridge
*NL*
Station
,
like
a
worm
with
a
fiery
head
winding
through
the
darkness
,
*NL*
obstinately
and
laboriously
.
It
passed
slowly
out
of
sight
;
but
still
*NL*
he
heard
in
his
ears
the
laborious
drone
of
the
engine
reiterating
the
*NL*
syllables
of
her
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
back
the
way
he
had
come
,
the
rhythm
of
the
engine
pounding
*NL*
in
his
ears
.
He
began
to
doubt
the
reality
of
what
memory
told
him
.
He
*NL*
halted
under
a
tree
and
allowed
the
rhythm
to
die
away
.
He
could
not
*NL*
feel
her
near
him
in
the
darkness
nor
her
voice
touch
his
ear
.
He
*NL*
waited
for
some
minutes
listening
.
He
could
hear
nothing
:
the
night
was
*NL*
perfectly
silent
.
He
listened
again
:
perfectly
silent
.
He
felt
that
he
*NL*
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
IVY
DAY
IN
THE
COMMITTEE
ROOM
*NL*
*NL*
OLD
JACK
raked
the
cinders
together
with
a
piece
of
cardboard
and
spread
*NL*
them
judiciously
over
the
whitening
dome
of
coals
.
When
the
dome
was
*NL*
thinly
covered
his
face
lapsed
into
darkness
but
,
as
he
set
himself
to
*NL*
fan
the
fire
again
,
his
crouching
shadow
ascended
the
opposite
wall
and
*NL*
his
face
slowly
re-emerged
into
light
.
It
was
an
old
man
's
face
,
very
*NL*
bony
and
hairy
.
The
moist
blue
eyes
blinked
at
the
fire
and
the
moist
*NL*
mouth
fell
open
at
times
,
munching
once
or
twice
mechanically
when
*NL*
it
closed
.
When
the
cinders
had
caught
he
laid
the
piece
of
cardboard
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
sighed
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
better
now
,
Mr.
O'Connor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
O'Connor
,
a
grey-haired
young
man
,
whose
face
was
disfigured
by
many
*NL*
blotches
and
pimples
,
had
just
brought
the
tobacco
for
a
cigarette
*NL*
into
a
shapely
cylinder
but
when
spoken
to
he
undid
his
handiwork
*NL*
meditatively
.
Then
he
began
to
roll
the
tobacco
again
meditatively
and
*NL*
after
a
moment
's
thought
decided
to
lick
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Mr.
Tierney
say
when
he
'd
be
back
?
''
he
asked
in
a
husky
falsetto
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
O'Connor
put
his
cigarette
into
his
mouth
and
began
search
his
*NL*
pockets
.
He
took
out
a
pack
of
thin
pasteboard
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
get
you
a
match
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
this
'll
do
,
''
said
Mr.
O'Connor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
selected
one
of
the
cards
and
read
what
was
printed
on
it
:
*NL*
*NL*

ROYAL

*NL*
----------
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Richard
J.
Tierney
,
P.L.G.
,
respectfully
solicits
the
favour
of
your
*NL*
vote
and
influence
at
the
coming
election
in
the
Royal
Exchange
Ward
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
O'Connor
had
been
engaged
by
Tierney
's
agent
to
canvass
one
part
of
*NL*
the
ward
but
,
as
the
weather
was
inclement
and
his
boots
let
in
the
wet
,
*NL*
he
spent
a
great
part
of
the
day
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
Committee
*NL*
Room
in
Wicklow
Street
with
Jack
,
the
old
caretaker
.
They
had
been
*NL*
sitting
thus
since
the
short
day
had
grown
dark
.
It
was
the
sixth
of
*NL*
October
,
dismal
and
cold
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
O'Connor
tore
a
strip
off
the
card
and
,
lighting
it
,
lit
his
*NL*
cigarette
.
As
he
did
so
the
flame
lit
up
a
leaf
of
dark
glossy
ivy
the
*NL*
lapel
of
his
coat
.
The
old
man
watched
him
attentively
and
then
,
taking
*NL*
up
the
piece
of
cardboard
again
,
began
to
fan
the
fire
slowly
while
his
*NL*
companion
smoked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
he
said
,
continuing
,
``
it
's
hard
to
know
what
way
to
bring
*NL*
up
children
.
Now
who
'd
think
he
'd
turn
out
like
that
!
I
sent
him
to
*NL*
the
Christian
Brothers
and
I
done
what
I
could
for
him
,
and
there
he
goes
*NL*
boosing
about
.
I
tried
to
make
him
someway
decent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replaced
the
cardboard
wearily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
I
'm
an
old
man
now
I
'd
change
his
tune
for
him
.
I
'd
take
the
stick
*NL*
to
his
back
and
beat
him
while
I
could
stand
over
him
--
as
I
done
many
*NL*
a
time
before
.
The
mother
,
you
know
,
she
cocks
him
up
with
this
and
*NL*
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
ruins
children
,
''
said
Mr.
O'Connor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
it
is
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
``
And
little
thanks
you
get
for
it

*NL*
only
impudence

He
takes
th

upper
hand
of
me
whenever
he
sees
I
've
a
*NL*
sup
taken

What
's
the
world
coming
to
when
sons
speaks
that
way
to
their
*NL*
father
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
age
is
he
?
''
said
Mr.
O'Connor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nineteen

''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
put
him
to
something
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure

am

I
never
done
at
the
drunken
bowsy
ever
since
he
left
*NL*
school

I
wo
n't
keep
you
,
'
I
says
.
`
You
must
get
a
job
for
yourself

'
*NL*
But
,
sure
,
it
's
worse
whenever
he
gets
a
job
;
he
drinks
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
O'Connor
shook
his
head
in
sympathy
,
and
the
old
man
fell
silent
,
*NL*
gazing
into
the
fire
.
Someone
opened
the
door
of
the
room
and
called
*NL*
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
Is
this
a
Freemasons
'
meeting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
in
the
dark
?
''
asked
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
,
Hynes
?
''
asked
Mr.
O'Connor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
What
are
you
doing
in
the
dark
?
''
said
Mr.
Hynes
.
advancing
into
*NL*
the
light
of
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
tall
,
slender
young
man
with
a
light
brown
moustache
.
Imminent
*NL*
little
drops
of
rain
hung
at
the
brim
of
his
hat
and
the
collar
of
his
*NL*
jacket-coat
was
turned
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mat
,
''
he
said
to
Mr.
O'Connor
,
``
how
goes
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
O'Connor
shook
his
head
.
The
old
man
left
the
hearth
and
,
after
*NL*
stumbling
about
the
room
returned
with
two
candlesticks
which
he
thrust
*NL*
one
after
the
other
into
the
fire
and
carried
to
the
table
.
A
denuded
*NL*
room
came
into
view
and
the
fire
lost
all
its
cheerful
colour
.
The
walls
*NL*
of
the
room
were
bare
except
for
a
copy
of
an
election
address
.
In
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
was
a
small
table
on
which
papers
were
heaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hynes
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
paid
you
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet

''
said
Mr.
O'Connor
.
``
I
hope
to
God
he
'll
not
leave
us
in
the
*NL*
lurch
tonight

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hynes
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
he
'll
pay
you

Never
fear

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
he
'll
look
smart
about
it

said
Mr.
*NL*
O'Connor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
,
Jack
?
''
said
Mr.
Hynes
satirically
to
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
returned
to
his
seat
by
the
fire
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
but

Not

*NL*
``
What

said
Mr.
Hynes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colgan

said
the
old
man
scornfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
because
Colgan
's
a
working-man

say
that

What

honest
bricklayer

as
good

Mr.

addressing
Mr.

*NL*

Mr.

``

The
three
men
fell
silent

The
old
man
began
to
rake
more
cinders
*NL*
together

Mr.
Hynes
took
off
his
hat

shook
it
and
then
turned
down
the

collar

displaying

an

The

Then
a

little
man
with
a
snuffling

nose
and
very
cold

pushed
in

He
walked
over

the

*NL*
*NL*
A
person
resembling
a
poor
clergyman

a
poor
actor
appeared
in
the
*NL*
doorway
.
His
black
clothes
were
tightly
buttoned
on
his
short
body
*NL*
and
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
he
wore
a
clergyman
's
collar
or
*NL*
a
layman
's
,
because
the
collar
of
his
shabby
frock-coat
,
the
uncovered
*NL*
buttons
of
which
reflected
the
candlelight
,
was
turned
up
about
his
*NL*
neck
.
He
wore
a
round
hat
of
hard
black
felt
.
His
face
,
shining
with
*NL*
raindrops
,
had
the
appearance
of
damp
yellow
cheese
save
where
two
rosy
*NL*
spots
indicated
the
cheekbones
.
He
opened
his
very
long
mouth
suddenly
*NL*
to
express
disappointment
and
at
the
same
time
opened
wide
his
very
*NL*
bright
blue
eyes
to
express
pleasure
and
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O

Keon

Mr.

up
from

velvety

*NL*
He
retreated
from
the
doorway
and
Mr.

,
seizing
one
of
the
*NL*
candlesticks

went
to
the
door

light

downstairs

Mr.

returned
with
the
candlestick
and
put
it
on

table

He
sat
*NL*
down
again

fire

There
was
silence
for
a
few
moments

At
this
point
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
a
boy
put
in
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

the

walking
in
sideways
and
depositing
*NL*
a
basket
on

floor
with
a
noise
of
shaken
bottles

The

man
helped
the
boy
to
transfer
the
bottles
from
the
basket
to
*NL*
the
table
and
counted
the
full
tally
.
After
the
transfer
the

put
his
*NL*
basket
on
his
arm
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any

*NL*
*NL*

said
the

The

went
out
and
Mr.

began
to
rub
his
hands
cheerfully
,
*NL*
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*

Ah

The

came
back
with
the

The
old
man
opened
three
bottles
*NL*
and
was
handing
back
the
corkscrew
when
Mr.

said
to
the

The

opened

grudgingly

handed

he
asked

As
the

said
nothing
further

the

took
the
bottle
and
said
:
*NL*
``
Here
's
my
best
respects

sir

''
to
Mr.
Henchy
,
drank
the
contents
,
put
*NL*
the
bottle
back
on
the
table
and
wiped
his
mouth
with
his
sleeve
.
Then
*NL*
he
took
up
the
corkscrew
and
went
out
of
the
door
sideways
,
muttering
*NL*
some
form
of
salutation

*NL*
*NL*
``

The
old
man
distributed
the
three
bottles
which
he
had
opened
and
the
*NL*
men
drank
from
them
simultaneously
.
After
having
drunk
each
placed
his
*NL*
bottle
on
the
mantelpiece
within
hand
's
reach
and
drew
in
a
long
breath

of
satisfaction

*NL*
``

*NL*
Here
two
men
entered
the
room
.
One
of
them
was
a
very
fat
man
whose
blue
*NL*
serge
clothes
seemed
to
be
in
danger
of
falling
from
his
sloping
figure
.
*NL*
He
had
a
big
face
which
resembled
a
young
ox
's
face
in
expression
,
*NL*
staring
blue
eyes
and
a
grizzled
moustache
.
The
other
man
,
who
was
much
*NL*
younger
and
frailer
,
had
a
thin
,
clean-shaven
face
.
He
wore
a
very
high
*NL*
double
collar
and
a
wide-brimmed
bowler
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello

Mr.

to
the
fat

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did

*NL*

``

Mr.

laughing

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

*NL*
``

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

Mr.

,
getting
up
quickly

Did

ever
*NL*
see
this

*NL*
*NL*
He
took
two
bottles
from
the
table
and
,
carrying
them
to
the
fire
,
put
*NL*
them
on
the
hob
.
Then
he
sat
down
again
by
the
fire
and
took
another
*NL*
drink
from
his
bottle
.
Mr.
Lyons
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
,
pushed
*NL*
his
hat
towards
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
began
to
swing
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which

asked

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crofton
sat
down
on
a
box
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
other
bottle
on
*NL*
the
hob
.
He
was
silent
for
two
reasons
.
The
first
reason
,
sufficient
in
*NL*
itself
,
was
that
he
had
nothing
to
say
;
the
second
reason
was
that
*NL*
he
considered
his
companions
beneath
him
.
He
had
been
a
canvasser
for
*NL*
Wilkins
,
the
Conservative
,
but
when
the
Conservatives
had
withdrawn
*NL*
their
man
and
,
choosing
the
lesser
of
two
evils
,
given
their
support
to
*NL*
the
Nationalist
candidate
,
he
had
been
engaged
to
work
for
Mr.
Tiemey
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
an
apologetic
``
Pok

''
was
heard
as
the
cork
flew
out
*NL*
of
Mr.
Lyons
'
bottle
.
Mr.
Lyons
jumped
off
the
table
,
went
to
the
fire
,
*NL*
took
his
bottle
and
carried
it
back
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just

Mr.

his

Listen
to
this
now
:
splendid
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
said
Mr.
O'Connor
.
``
Fire
away
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hynes
did
not
seem
to
remember
at
once
the
piece
to
which
they
were
*NL*
alluding
,
but
,
after
reflecting
a
while
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
that
thing
is
it
...
Sure
,
that
's
old
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
with
it
,
man
!
''
said
Mr.
O'Connor
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Sh

,
''
said
Mr.
Henchy
.
``
Now
,
Joe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hynes
hesitated
a
little
longer
.
Then
amid
the
silence
he
took
off
*NL*
his
hat
,
laid
it
on
the
table
and
stood
up
.
He
seemed
to
be
rehearsing
*NL*
the
piece
in
his
mind
.
After
a
rather
long
pause
he
announced
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
DEATH
OF
PARNELL
*NL*
6th
October
,
1891
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
cleared
his
throat
once
or
twice
and
then
began
to
recite
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
dead
.
Our
Uncrowned
King
is
dead
.
*NL*
O
,
Erin
,
mourn
with
grief
and
woe
*NL*
For
he
lies
dead
whom
the
fell
gang
*NL*
Of
modern
hypocrites
laid
low
.
*NL*
He
lies
slain
by
the
coward
hounds
*NL*
He
raised
to
glory
from
the
mire
;
*NL*
And
Erin
's
hopes
and
Erin
's
dreams
*NL*
Perish
upon
her
monarch
's
pyre
.
*NL*
In
palace
,
cabin
or
in
cot
*NL*
The
Irish
heart
where'er
it
be
*NL*
Is
bowed
with
woe
--
for
he
is
gone
*NL*
Who
would
have
wrought
her
destiny
.
*NL*
He
would
have
had
his
Erin
famed
,
*NL*
The
green
flag
gloriously
unfurled
,
*NL*
Her
statesmen
,
bards
and
warriors
raised
*NL*
Before
the
nations
of
the
World
.
*NL*
He
dreamed
-LRB-
alas
,
't
was
but
a
dream
!
-RRB-
*NL*
Of
Liberty
:
but
as
he
strove
*NL*
To
clutch
that
idol
,
treachery
*NL*
Sundered
him
from
the
thing
he
loved
.
*NL*
Shame
on
the
coward
,
caitiff
hands
*NL*
That
smote
their
Lord
or
with
a
kiss
*NL*
Betrayed
him
to
the
rabble-rout
*NL*
Of
fawning
priests
--
no
friends
of
his
.
*NL*
May
everlasting
shame
consume
*NL*
The
memory
of
those
who
tried
*NL*
To
befoul
and
smear
the
exalted
name
*NL*
Of
one
who
spurned
them
in
his
pride
.
*NL*
He
fell
as
fall
the
mighty
ones
,
*NL*
Nobly
undaunted
to
the
last
,
*NL*
And
death
has
now
united
him
*NL*
With
Erin
's
heroes
of
the
past
.
*NL*
No
sound
of
strife
disturb
his
sleep
!
*NL*
Calmly
he
rests
:
no
human
pain
*NL*
Or
high
ambition
spurs
him
now
*NL*
The
peaks
of
glory
to
attain
.
*NL*
They
had
their
way
:
they
laid
him
low
.
*NL*
But
Erin
,
list
,
his
spirit
may
*NL*
Rise
,
like
the
Phoenix
from
the
flames
,
*NL*
When
breaks
the
dawning
of
the
day
,
*NL*
The
day
that
brings
us
Freedom
's
reign
.
*NL*
And
on
that
day
may
Erin
well
*NL*
Pledge
in
the
cup
she
lifts
to
Joy
*NL*
One
grief
--
the
memory
of
Parnell
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hynes
sat
down
again
on
the
table
.
When
he
had
finished
his
*NL*
recitation
there
was
a
silence
and
then
a
burst
of
clapping
:
even
Mr.
*NL*
Lyons
clapped
.
The
applause
continued
for
a
little
time
.
When
it
had
*NL*
ceased
all
the
auditors
drank
from
their
bottles
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pok
!
The
cork
flew
out
of
Mr.
Hynes
'
bottle
,
but
Mr.
Hynes
remained
*NL*
sitting
flushed
and
bare-headed
on
the
table
.
He
did
not
seem
to
have
*NL*
heard
the
invitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
man
,
Joe
!
''
said
Mr.
O'Connor
,
taking
out
his
cigarette
papers
and
*NL*
pouch
the
better
to
hide
his
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
that
,
Crofton
?
''
cried
Mr.
Henchy
.
``
Is
n't
that
*NL*
fine
?
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crofton
said
that
it
was
a
very
fine
piece
of
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
MOTHER
*NL*
*NL*
MR
HOLOHAN
,
assistant
secretary
of
the
Eire
Abu
Society
,
had
been
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
Dublin
for
nearly
a
month
,
with
his
hands
and
*NL*
pockets
full
of
dirty
pieces
of
paper
,
arranging
about
the
series
of
*NL*
concerts
.
He
had
a
game
leg
and
for
this
his
friends
called
him
Hoppy
*NL*
Holohan
.
He
walked
up
and
down
constantly
,
stood
by
the
hour
at
street
*NL*
corners
arguing
the
point
and
made
notes
;
but
in
the
end
it
was
Mrs.
*NL*
Kearney
who
arranged
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Devlin
had
become
Mrs.
Kearney
out
of
spite
.
She
had
been
educated
*NL*
in
a
high-class
convent
,
where
she
had
learned
French
and
music
.
As
*NL*
she
was
naturally
pale
and
unbending
in
manner
she
made
few
friends
at
*NL*
school
.
When
she
came
to
the
age
of
marriage
she
was
sent
out
to
many
*NL*
houses
where
her
playing
and
ivory
manners
were
much
admired
.
She
sat
*NL*
amid
the
chilly
circle
of
her
accomplishments
,
waiting
for
some
suitor
*NL*
to
brave
it
and
offer
her
a
brilliant
life
.
But
the
young
men
whom
she
*NL*
met
were
ordinary
and
she
gave
them
no
encouragement
,
trying
to
console
*NL*
her
romantic
desires
by
eating
a
great
deal
of
Turkish
Delight
in
*NL*
secret
.
However
,
when
she
drew
near
the
limit
and
her
friends
began
*NL*
to
loosen
their
tongues
about
her
,
she
silenced
them
by
marrying
Mr.
*NL*
Kearney
,
who
was
a
bootmaker
on
Ormond
Quay
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
much
older
than
she
.
His
conversation
,
which
was
serious
,
took
*NL*
place
at
intervals
in
his
great
brown
beard
.
After
the
first
year
of
*NL*
married
life
,
Mrs.
Kearney
perceived
that
such
a
man
would
wear
better
*NL*
than
a
romantic
person
,
but
she
never
put
her
own
romantic
ideas
away
.
*NL*
He
was
sober
,
thrifty
and
pious
;
he
went
to
the
altar
every
first
*NL*
Friday
,
sometimes
with
her
,
oftener
by
himself
.
But
she
never
weakened
*NL*
in
her
religion
and
was
a
good
wife
to
him
.
At
some
party
in
a
strange
*NL*
house
when
she
lifted
her
eyebrow
ever
so
slightly
he
stood
up
to
take
*NL*
his
leave
and
,
when
his
cough
troubled
him
,
she
put
the
eider-down
quilt
*NL*
over
his
feet
and
made
a
strong
rum
punch
.
For
his
part
,
he
was
a
model
*NL*
father
.
By
paying
a
small
sum
every
week
into
a
society
,
he
ensured
for
*NL*
both
his
daughters
a
dowry
of
one
hundred
pounds
each
when
they
came
to
*NL*
the
age
of
twenty-four
.
He
sent
the
older
daughter
,
Kathleen
,
to
a
good
*NL*
convent
,
where
she
learned
French
and
music
,
and
afterward
paid
her
*NL*
fees
at
the
Academy
.
Every
year
in
the
month
of
July
Mrs.
Kearney
found
*NL*
occasion
to
say
to
some
friend
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
man
is
packing
us
off
to
Skerries
for
a
few
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
was
not
Skerries
it
was
Howth
or
Greystones
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Irish
Revival
began
to
be
appreciable
Mrs.
Kearney
determined
*NL*
to
take
advantage
of
her
daughter
's
name
and
brought
an
Irish
teacher
to
*NL*
the
house
.
Kathleen
and
her
sister
sent
Irish
picture
postcards
to
their
*NL*
friends
and
these
friends
sent
back
other
Irish
picture
postcards
.
*NL*
On
special
Sundays
,
when
Mr.
Kearney
went
with
his
family
to
the
*NL*
pro-cathedral
,
a
little
crowd
of
people
would
assemble
after
mass
at
*NL*
the
corner
of
Cathedral
Street
.
They
were
all
friends
of
the
*NL*
Kearneys
--
musical
friends
or
Nationalist
friends
;
and
,
when
they
had
*NL*
played
every
little
counter
of
gossip
,
they
shook
hands
with
one
*NL*
another
all
together
,
laughing
at
the
crossing
of
so
many
hands
,
and
said
*NL*
good-bye
to
one
another
in
Irish
.
Soon
the
name
of
Miss
Kathleen
Kearney
*NL*
began
to
be
heard
often
on
people
's
lips
.
People
said
that
she
was
*NL*
very
clever
at
music
and
a
very
nice
girl
and
,
moreover
,
that
she
was
*NL*
a
believer
in
the
language
movement
.
Mrs.
Kearney
was
well
content
at
*NL*
this
.
Therefore
she
was
not
surprised
when
one
day
Mr.
Holohan
came
to
*NL*
her
and
proposed
that
her
daughter
should
be
the
accompanist
at
a
*NL*
series
of
four
grand
concerts
which
his
Society
was
going
to
give
in
the
*NL*
Antient
Concert
Rooms
.
She
brought
him
into
the
drawing-room
,
made
him
*NL*
sit
down
and
brought
out
the
decanter
and
the
silver
biscuit-barrel
.
She
*NL*
entered
heart
and
soul
into
the
details
of
the
enterprise
,
advised
and
*NL*
dissuaded
:
and
finally
a
contract
was
drawn
up
by
which
Kathleen
was
to
*NL*
receive
eight
guineas
for
her
services
as
accompanist
at
the
four
grand
*NL*
concerts
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Holohan
was
a
novice
in
such
delicate
matters
as
the
wording
of
*NL*
bills
and
the
disposing
of
items
for
a
programme
,
Mrs.
Kearney
helped
*NL*
him
.
She
had
tact
.
She
knew
what
artistes
should
go
into
capitals
and
*NL*
what
artistes
should
go
into
small
type
.
She
knew
that
the
first
tenor
*NL*
would
not
like
to
come
on
after
Mr.
Meade
's
comic
turn
.
To
keep
the
*NL*
audience
continually
diverted
she
slipped
the
doubtful
items
in
between
*NL*
the
old
favourites
.
Mr.
Holohan
called
to
see
her
every
day
to
have
her
*NL*
advice
on
some
point
.
She
was
invariably
friendly
and
advising
--
homely
,
*NL*
in
fact
.
She
pushed
the
decanter
towards
him
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
help
yourself
,
Mr.
Holohan
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
he
was
helping
himself
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
!
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
went
on
smoothly
.
Mrs.
Kearney
bought
some
lovely
blush-pink
*NL*
charmeuse
in
Brown
Thomas
's
to
let
into
the
front
of
Kathleen
's
dress
.
*NL*
It
cost
a
pretty
penny
;
but
there
are
occasions
when
a
little
expense
*NL*
is
justifiable
.
She
took
a
dozen
of
two-shilling
tickets
for
the
final
*NL*
concert
and
sent
them
to
those
friends
who
could
not
be
trusted
to
come
*NL*
otherwise
.
She
forgot
nothing
,
and
,
thanks
to
her
,
everything
that
was
*NL*
to
be
done
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
concerts
were
to
be
on
Wednesday
,
Thursday
,
Friday
and
Saturday
.
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Kearney
arrived
with
her
daughter
at
the
Antient
Concert
Rooms
*NL*
on
Wednesday
night
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
things
.
A
few
young
men
,
*NL*
wearing
bright
blue
badges
in
their
coats
,
stood
idle
in
the
vestibule
;
*NL*
none
of
them
wore
evening
dress
.
She
passed
by
with
her
daughter
and
a
*NL*
quick
glance
through
the
open
door
of
the
hall
showed
her
the
cause
of
*NL*
the
stewards
'
idleness
.
At
first
she
wondered
had
she
mistaken
the
hour
.
*NL*
No
,
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
eight
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dressing-room
behind
the
stage
she
was
introduced
to
the
*NL*
secretary
of
the
Society
,
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
.
She
smiled
and
shook
his
*NL*
hand
.
He
was
a
little
man
,
with
a
white
,
vacant
face
.
She
noticed
that
*NL*
he
wore
his
soft
brown
hat
carelessly
on
the
side
of
his
head
and
that
*NL*
his
accent
was
flat
.
He
held
a
programme
in
his
hand
,
and
,
while
he
was
*NL*
talking
to
her
,
he
chewed
one
end
of
it
into
a
moist
pulp
.
He
seemed
*NL*
to
bear
disappointments
lightly
.
Mr.
Holohan
came
into
the
dressingroom
*NL*
every
few
minutes
with
reports
from
the
box-office
.
The
artistes
talked
*NL*
among
themselves
nervously
,
glanced
from
time
to
time
at
the
mirror
and
*NL*
rolled
and
unrolled
their
music
.
When
it
was
nearly
half-past
eight
,
the
*NL*
few
people
in
the
hall
began
to
express
their
desire
to
be
entertained
.
*NL*
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
came
in
,
smiled
vacantly
at
the
room
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
I
suppose
we
'd
better
open
the
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kearney
rewarded
his
very
flat
final
syllable
with
a
quick
stare
of
*NL*
contempt
,
and
then
said
to
her
daughter
encouragingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ready
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
an
opportunity
,
she
called
Mr.
Holohan
aside
and
asked
him
*NL*
to
tell
her
what
it
meant
.
Mr.
Holohan
did
not
know
what
it
meant
.
*NL*
He
said
that
the
Committee
had
made
a
mistake
in
arranging
for
four
*NL*
concerts
:
four
was
too
many
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
artistes
!
''
said
Mrs.
Kearney
.
``
Of
course
they
are
doing
their
*NL*
best
,
but
really
they
are
not
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Holohan
admitted
that
the
artistes
were
no
good
but
the
Committee
,
*NL*
he
said
,
had
decided
to
let
the
first
three
concerts
go
as
they
pleased
*NL*
and
reserve
all
the
talent
for
Saturday
night
.
Mrs.
Kearney
said
*NL*
nothing
,
but
,
as
the
mediocre
items
followed
one
another
on
the
platform
*NL*
and
the
few
people
in
the
hall
grew
fewer
and
fewer
,
she
began
to
regret
*NL*
that
she
had
put
herself
to
any
expense
for
such
a
concert
.
There
was
*NL*
something
she
did
n't
like
in
the
look
of
things
and
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
's
*NL*
vacant
smile
irritated
her
very
much
.
However
,
she
said
nothing
and
*NL*
waited
to
see
how
it
would
end
.
The
concert
expired
shortly
before
ten
,
*NL*
and
everyone
went
home
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
concert
on
Thursday
night
was
better
attended
,
but
Mrs.
Kearney
*NL*
saw
at
once
that
the
house
was
filled
with
paper
.
The
audience
behaved
*NL*
indecorously
,
as
if
the
concert
were
an
informal
dress
rehearsal
.
Mr.
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
seemed
to
enjoy
himself
;
he
was
quite
unconscious
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Kearney
was
taking
angry
note
of
his
conduct
.
He
stood
at
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
screen
,
from
time
to
time
jutting
out
his
head
and
exchanging
a
*NL*
laugh
with
two
friends
in
the
corner
of
the
balcony
.
In
the
course
of
*NL*
the
evening
,
Mrs.
Kearney
learned
that
the
Friday
concert
was
to
be
*NL*
abandoned
and
that
the
Committee
was
going
to
move
heaven
and
earth
to
*NL*
secure
a
bumper
house
on
Saturday
night
.
When
she
heard
this
,
she
sought
*NL*
out
Mr.
Holohan
.
She
buttonholed
him
as
he
was
limping
out
quickly
with
*NL*
a
glass
of
lemonade
for
a
young
lady
and
asked
him
was
it
true
.
Yes
,
it
*NL*
was
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
of
course
,
that
does
n't
alter
the
contract
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
*NL*
contract
was
for
four
concerts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Holohan
seemed
to
be
in
a
hurry
;
he
advised
her
to
speak
to
Mr.
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
.
Mrs.
Kearney
was
now
beginning
to
be
alarmed
.
She
called
*NL*
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
away
from
his
screen
and
told
him
that
her
daughter
had
*NL*
signed
for
four
concerts
and
that
,
of
course
,
according
to
the
terms
*NL*
of
the
contract
,
she
should
receive
the
sum
originally
stipulated
for
,
*NL*
whether
the
society
gave
the
four
concerts
or
not
.
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
,
who
*NL*
did
not
catch
the
point
at
issue
very
quickly
,
seemed
unable
to
resolve
*NL*
the
difficulty
and
said
that
he
would
bring
the
matter
before
the
*NL*
Committee
.
Mrs.
Kearney
's
anger
began
to
flutter
in
her
cheek
and
she
*NL*
had
all
she
could
do
to
keep
from
asking
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
the
Cometty
pray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
knew
that
it
would
not
be
ladylike
to
do
that
:
so
she
was
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
boys
were
sent
out
into
the
principal
streets
of
Dublin
early
on
*NL*
Friday
morning
with
bundles
of
handbills
.
Special
puffs
appeared
in
all
*NL*
the
evening
papers
,
reminding
the
music-loving
public
of
the
treat
which
*NL*
was
in
store
for
it
on
the
following
evening
.
Mrs.
Kearney
was
*NL*
somewhat
reassured
,
but
she
thought
well
to
tell
her
husband
part
of
*NL*
her
suspicions
.
He
listened
carefully
and
said
that
perhaps
it
would
be
*NL*
better
if
he
went
with
her
on
Saturday
night
.
She
agreed
.
She
respected
*NL*
her
husband
in
the
same
way
as
she
respected
the
General
Post
Office
,
as
*NL*
something
large
,
secure
and
fixed
;
and
though
she
knew
the
small
number
*NL*
of
his
talents
she
appreciated
his
abstract
value
as
a
male
.
She
was
*NL*
glad
that
he
had
suggested
coming
with
her
.
She
thought
her
plans
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
of
the
grand
concert
came
.
Mrs.
Kearney
,
with
her
husband
and
*NL*
daughter
,
arrived
at
the
Antient
Concert
Rooms
three-quarters
of
an
hour
*NL*
before
the
time
at
which
the
concert
was
to
begin
.
By
ill
luck
it
was
a
*NL*
rainy
evening
.
Mrs.
Kearney
placed
her
daughter
's
clothes
and
music
in
*NL*
charge
of
her
husband
and
went
all
over
the
building
looking
for
Mr.
*NL*
Holohan
or
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
.
She
could
find
neither
.
She
asked
the
*NL*
stewards
was
any
member
of
the
Committee
in
the
hall
and
,
after
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
trouble
,
a
steward
brought
out
a
little
woman
named
Miss
*NL*
Beirne
to
whom
Mrs.
Kearney
explained
that
she
wanted
to
see
one
of
the
*NL*
secretaries
.
Miss
Beirne
expected
them
any
minute
and
asked
could
she
do
*NL*
anything
.
Mrs.
Kearney
looked
searchingly
at
the
oldish
face
which
was
*NL*
screwed
into
an
expression
of
trustfulness
and
enthusiasm
and
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
woman
hoped
they
would
have
a
good
house
.
She
looked
out
*NL*
at
the
rain
until
the
melancholy
of
the
wet
street
effaced
all
the
*NL*
trustfulness
and
enthusiasm
from
her
twisted
features
.
Then
she
gave
a
*NL*
little
sigh
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
!
We
did
our
best
,
the
dear
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kearney
had
to
go
back
to
the
dressing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
artistes
were
arriving
.
The
bass
and
the
second
tenor
had
already
*NL*
come
.
The
bass
,
Mr.
Duggan
,
was
a
slender
young
man
with
a
scattered
*NL*
black
moustache
.
He
was
the
son
of
a
hall
porter
in
an
office
in
the
*NL*
city
and
,
as
a
boy
,
he
had
sung
prolonged
bass
notes
in
the
resounding
*NL*
hall
.
From
this
humble
state
he
had
raised
himself
until
he
had
become
*NL*
a
first-rate
artiste
.
He
had
appeared
in
grand
opera
.
One
night
,
when
an
*NL*
operatic
artiste
had
fallen
ill
,
he
had
undertaken
the
part
of
the
king
*NL*
in
the
opera
of
Maritana
at
the
Queen
's
Theatre
.
He
sang
his
music
with
*NL*
great
feeling
and
volume
and
was
warmly
welcomed
by
the
gallery
;
but
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
he
marred
the
good
impression
by
wiping
his
nose
in
his
*NL*
gloved
hand
once
or
twice
out
of
thoughtlessness
.
He
was
unassuming
and
*NL*
spoke
little
.
He
said
yous
so
softly
that
it
passed
unnoticed
and
he
*NL*
never
drank
anything
stronger
than
milk
for
his
voice
's
sake
.
Mr.
Bell
,
*NL*
the
second
tenor
,
was
a
fair-haired
little
man
who
competed
every
year
*NL*
for
prizes
at
the
Feis
Ceoil
.
On
his
fourth
trial
he
had
been
awarded
*NL*
a
bronze
medal
.
He
was
extremely
nervous
and
extremely
jealous
of
*NL*
other
tenors
and
he
covered
his
nervous
jealousy
with
an
ebullient
*NL*
friendliness
.
It
was
his
humour
to
have
people
know
what
an
ordeal
a
*NL*
concert
was
to
him
.
Therefore
when
he
saw
Mr.
Duggan
he
went
over
to
him
*NL*
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
in
it
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Duggan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bell
laughed
at
his
fellow-sufferer
,
held
out
his
hand
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kearney
passed
by
these
two
young
men
and
went
to
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
screen
to
view
the
house
.
The
seats
were
being
filled
up
rapidly
and
a
*NL*
pleasant
noise
circulated
in
the
auditorium
.
She
came
back
and
spoke
to
*NL*
her
husband
privately
.
Their
conversation
was
evidently
about
Kathleen
*NL*
for
they
both
glanced
at
her
often
as
she
stood
chatting
to
one
of
her
*NL*
Nationalist
friends
,
Miss
Healy
,
the
contralto
.
An
unknown
solitary
*NL*
woman
with
a
pale
face
walked
through
the
room
.
The
women
followed
with
*NL*
keen
eyes
the
faded
blue
dress
which
was
stretched
upon
a
meagre
body
.
*NL*
Someone
said
that
she
was
Madam
Glynn
,
the
soprano
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
where
did
they
dig
her
up
,
''
said
Kathleen
to
Miss
Healy
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
sure
I
never
heard
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Healy
had
to
smile
.
Mr.
Holohan
limped
into
the
dressing-room
*NL*
at
that
moment
and
the
two
young
ladies
asked
him
who
was
the
unknown
*NL*
woman
.
Mr.
Holohan
said
that
she
was
Madam
Glynn
from
London
.
Madam
*NL*
Glynn
took
her
stand
in
a
corner
of
the
room
,
holding
a
roll
of
music
*NL*
stiffly
before
her
and
from
time
to
time
changing
the
direction
of
her
*NL*
startled
gaze
.
The
shadow
took
her
faded
dress
into
shelter
but
fell
*NL*
revengefully
into
the
little
cup
behind
her
collar-bone
.
The
noise
of
*NL*
the
hall
became
more
audible
.
The
first
tenor
and
the
baritone
arrived
*NL*
together
.
They
were
both
well
dressed
,
stout
and
complacent
and
they
*NL*
brought
a
breath
of
opulence
among
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kearney
brought
her
daughter
over
to
them
,
and
talked
to
them
*NL*
amiably
.
She
wanted
to
be
on
good
terms
with
them
but
,
while
she
strove
*NL*
to
be
polite
,
her
eyes
followed
Mr.
Holohan
in
his
limping
and
devious
*NL*
courses
.
As
soon
as
she
could
she
excused
herself
and
went
out
after
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Holohan
,
I
want
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
down
to
a
discreet
part
of
the
corridor
.
Mrs
Kearney
asked
*NL*
him
when
was
her
daughter
going
to
be
paid
.
Mr.
Holohan
said
that
Mr.
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
had
charge
of
that
.
Mrs.
Kearney
said
that
she
did
n't
know
*NL*
anything
about
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
.
Her
daughter
had
signed
a
contract
for
*NL*
eight
guineas
and
she
would
have
to
be
paid
.
Mr.
Holohan
said
that
it
*NL*
was
n't
his
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
n't
it
your
business
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Kearney
.
``
Did
n't
you
yourself
*NL*
bring
her
the
contract
?
Anyway
,
if
it
's
not
your
business
it
's
my
*NL*
business
and
I
mean
to
see
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
speak
to
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
,
''
said
Mr.
Holohan
distantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
,
''
repeated
Mrs.
Kearney
.
``
I
*NL*
have
my
contract
,
and
I
intend
to
see
that
it
is
carried
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
back
to
the
dressing-room
her
cheeks
were
slightly
*NL*
suffused
.
The
room
was
lively
.
Two
men
in
outdoor
dress
had
taken
*NL*
possession
of
the
fireplace
and
were
chatting
familiarly
with
Miss
Healy
*NL*
and
the
baritone
.
They
were
the
Freeman
man
and
Mr.
O'Madden
Burke
.
The
*NL*
Freeman
man
had
come
in
to
say
that
he
could
not
wait
for
the
concert
as
*NL*
he
had
to
report
the
lecture
which
an
American
priest
was
giving
in
*NL*
the
Mansion
House
.
He
said
they
were
to
leave
the
report
for
him
at
the
*NL*
Freeman
office
and
he
would
see
that
it
went
in
.
He
was
a
grey-haired
*NL*
man
,
with
a
plausible
voice
and
careful
manners
.
He
held
an
extinguished
*NL*
cigar
in
his
hand
and
the
aroma
of
cigar
smoke
floated
near
him
.
He
had
*NL*
not
intended
to
stay
a
moment
because
concerts
and
artistes
bored
him
*NL*
considerably
but
he
remained
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
.
Miss
*NL*
Healy
stood
in
front
of
him
,
talking
and
laughing
.
He
was
old
enough
to
*NL*
suspect
one
reason
for
her
politeness
but
young
enough
in
spirit
to
*NL*
turn
the
moment
to
account
.
The
warmth
,
fragrance
and
colour
of
her
body
*NL*
appealed
to
his
senses
.
He
was
pleasantly
conscious
that
the
bosom
which
*NL*
he
saw
rise
and
fall
slowly
beneath
him
rose
and
fell
at
that
moment
*NL*
for
him
,
that
the
laughter
and
fragrance
and
wilful
glances
were
his
*NL*
tribute
.
When
he
could
stay
no
longer
he
took
leave
of
her
regretfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O'Madden
Burke
will
write
the
notice
,
''
he
explained
to
Mr.
Holohan
,
*NL*
``
and
I
'll
see
it
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
,
Mr.
Hendrick
,
''
said
Mr.
Holohan
,
``
you
'll
see
it
*NL*
in
,
I
know
.
Now
,
wo
n't
you
have
a
little
something
before
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
,
''
said
Mr.
Hendrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
went
along
some
tortuous
passages
and
up
a
dark
staircase
*NL*
and
came
to
a
secluded
room
where
one
of
the
stewards
was
uncorking
*NL*
bottles
for
a
few
gentlemen
.
One
of
these
gentlemen
was
Mr.
O'Madden
*NL*
Burke
,
who
had
found
out
the
room
by
instinct
.
He
was
a
suave
,
elderly
*NL*
man
who
balanced
his
imposing
body
,
when
at
rest
,
upon
a
large
silk
*NL*
umbrella
.
His
magniloquent
western
name
was
the
moral
umbrella
upon
*NL*
which
he
balanced
the
fine
problem
of
his
finances
.
He
was
widely
*NL*
respected
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Mr.
Holohan
was
entertaining
the
Freeman
man
Mrs.
Kearney
was
*NL*
speaking
so
animatedly
to
her
husband
that
he
had
to
ask
her
to
lower
*NL*
her
voice
.
The
conversation
of
the
others
in
the
dressing-room
had
*NL*
become
strained
.
Mr.
Bell
,
the
first
item
,
stood
ready
with
his
music
*NL*
but
the
accompanist
made
no
sign
.
Evidently
something
was
wrong
.
Mr.
*NL*
Kearney
looked
straight
before
him
,
stroking
his
beard
,
while
Mrs.
*NL*
Kearney
spoke
into
Kathleen
's
ear
with
subdued
emphasis
.
From
the
hall
*NL*
came
sounds
of
encouragement
,
clapping
and
stamping
of
feet
.
The
*NL*
first
tenor
and
the
baritone
and
Miss
Healy
stood
together
,
waiting
*NL*
tranquilly
,
but
Mr.
Bell
's
nerves
were
greatly
agitated
because
he
was
*NL*
afraid
the
audience
would
think
that
he
had
come
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Holohan
and
Mr.
O'Madden
Burke
came
into
the
room
.
In
a
moment
Mr.
*NL*
Holohan
perceived
the
hush
.
He
went
over
to
Mrs.
Kearney
and
spoke
*NL*
with
her
earnestly
.
While
they
were
speaking
the
noise
in
the
hall
grew
*NL*
louder
.
Mr.
Holohan
became
very
red
and
excited
.
He
spoke
volubly
,
but
*NL*
Mrs.
Kearney
said
curtly
at
intervals
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wo
n't
go
on
.
She
must
get
her
eight
guineas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Holohan
pointed
desperately
towards
the
hall
where
the
audience
was
*NL*
clapping
and
stamping
.
He
appealed
to
Mr
Kearney
and
to
Kathleen
.
But
*NL*
Mr.
Kearney
continued
to
stroke
his
beard
and
Kathleen
looked
down
,
*NL*
moving
the
point
of
her
new
shoe
:
it
was
not
her
fault
.
Mrs.
Kearney
*NL*
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wo
n't
go
on
without
her
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
swift
struggle
of
tongues
Mr.
Holohan
hobbled
out
in
haste
.
*NL*
The
room
was
silent
.
When
the
strain
of
the
silence
had
become
somewhat
*NL*
painful
Miss
Healy
said
to
the
baritone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
Mrs.
Pat
Campbell
this
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
baritone
had
not
seen
her
but
he
had
been
told
that
she
was
very
*NL*
fine
.
The
conversation
went
no
further
.
The
first
tenor
bent
his
head
*NL*
and
began
to
count
the
links
of
the
gold
chain
which
was
extended
across
*NL*
his
waist
,
smiling
and
humming
random
notes
to
observe
the
effect
on
the
*NL*
frontal
sinus
.
From
time
to
time
everyone
glanced
at
Mrs.
Kearney
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
in
the
auditorium
had
risen
to
a
clamour
when
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
*NL*
burst
into
the
room
,
followed
by
Mr.
Holohan
,
who
was
panting
.
The
*NL*
clapping
and
stamping
in
the
hall
were
punctuated
by
whistling
.
Mr.
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
held
a
few
banknotes
in
his
hand
.
He
counted
out
four
*NL*
into
Mrs.
Kearney
's
hand
and
said
she
would
get
the
other
half
at
the
*NL*
interval
.
Mrs.
Kearney
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
four
shillings
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Kathleen
gathered
in
her
skirt
and
said
:
``
Now
,
Mr.
Bell
,
''
to
*NL*
the
first
item
,
who
was
shaking
like
an
aspen
.
The
singer
and
the
*NL*
accompanist
went
out
together
.
The
noise
in
hall
died
away
.
There
was
a
*NL*
pause
of
a
few
seconds
:
and
then
the
piano
was
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
part
of
the
concert
was
very
successful
except
for
Madam
*NL*
Glynn
's
item
.
The
poor
lady
sang
Killarney
in
a
bodiless
gasping
voice
,
*NL*
with
all
the
old-fashioned
mannerisms
of
intonation
and
pronunciation
*NL*
which
she
believed
lent
elegance
to
her
singing
.
She
looked
as
if
she
*NL*
had
been
resurrected
from
an
old
stage-wardrobe
and
the
cheaper
parts
*NL*
of
the
hall
made
fun
of
her
high
wailing
notes
.
The
first
tenor
and
the
*NL*
contralto
,
however
,
brought
down
the
house
.
Kathleen
played
a
selection
*NL*
of
Irish
airs
which
was
generously
applauded
.
The
first
part
closed
with
*NL*
a
stirring
patriotic
recitation
delivered
by
a
young
lady
who
arranged
*NL*
amateur
theatricals
.
It
was
deservedly
applauded
;
and
,
when
it
was
*NL*
ended
,
the
men
went
out
for
the
interval
,
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
the
dressing-room
was
a
hive
of
excitement
.
In
one
corner
*NL*
were
Mr.
Holohan
,
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
,
Miss
Beirne
,
two
of
the
stewards
,
the
*NL*
baritone
,
the
bass
,
and
Mr.
O'Madden
Burke
.
Mr.
O'Madden
Burke
said
it
*NL*
was
the
most
scandalous
exhibition
he
had
ever
witnessed
.
Miss
Kathleen
*NL*
Kearney
's
musical
career
was
ended
in
Dublin
after
that
,
he
said
.
The
*NL*
baritone
was
asked
what
did
he
think
of
Mrs.
Kearney
's
conduct
.
He
did
*NL*
not
like
to
say
anything
.
He
had
been
paid
his
money
and
wished
to
be
at
*NL*
peace
with
men
.
However
,
he
said
that
Mrs.
Kearney
might
have
taken
the
*NL*
artistes
into
consideration
.
The
stewards
and
the
secretaries
debated
*NL*
hotly
as
to
what
should
be
done
when
the
interval
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
with
Miss
Beirne
,
''
said
Mr.
O'Madden
Burke
.
``
Pay
her
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
corner
of
the
room
were
Mrs.
Kearney
and
her
husband
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bell
,
Miss
Healy
and
the
young
lady
who
had
to
recite
the
patriotic
*NL*
piece
.
Mrs.
Kearney
said
that
the
Committee
had
treated
her
*NL*
scandalously
.
She
had
spared
neither
trouble
nor
expense
and
this
was
*NL*
how
she
was
repaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
thought
they
had
only
a
girl
to
deal
with
and
that
,
therefore
,
they
*NL*
could
ride
roughshod
over
her
.
But
she
would
show
them
their
mistake
.
*NL*
They
would
n't
have
dared
to
have
treated
her
like
that
if
she
had
been
a
*NL*
man
.
But
she
would
see
that
her
daughter
got
her
rights
:
she
would
n't
*NL*
be
fooled
.
If
they
did
n't
pay
her
to
the
last
farthing
she
would
make
*NL*
Dublin
ring
.
Of
course
she
was
sorry
for
the
sake
of
the
artistes
.
But
*NL*
what
else
could
she
do
?
She
appealed
to
the
second
tenor
who
said
he
*NL*
thought
she
had
not
been
well
treated
.
Then
she
appealed
to
Miss
Healy
.
*NL*
Miss
Healy
wanted
to
join
the
other
group
but
she
did
not
like
to
do
so
*NL*
because
she
was
a
great
friend
of
Kathleen
's
and
the
Kearneys
had
often
*NL*
invited
her
to
their
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
first
part
was
ended
Mr.
Fitzpatrick
and
Mr.
Holohan
went
*NL*
over
to
Mrs.
Kearney
and
told
her
that
the
other
four
guineas
would
be
*NL*
paid
after
the
Committee
meeting
on
the
following
Tuesday
and
that
,
in
*NL*
case
her
daughter
did
not
play
for
the
second
part
,
the
Committee
would
*NL*
consider
the
contract
broken
and
would
pay
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
seen
any
Committee
,
''
said
Mrs.
Kearney
angrily
.
``
My
daughter
*NL*
has
her
contract
.
She
will
get
four
pounds
eight
into
her
hand
or
a
foot
*NL*
she
wo
n't
put
on
that
platform
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
surprised
at
you
,
Mrs.
Kearney
,
''
said
Mr.
Holohan
.
``
I
never
thought
*NL*
you
would
treat
us
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
way
did
you
treat
me
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Kearney
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
was
inundated
with
an
angry
colour
and
she
looked
as
if
she
*NL*
would
attack
someone
with
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
asking
for
my
rights
.
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
some
sense
of
decency
,
''
said
Mr.
Holohan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
I
,
indeed
?
...
And
when
I
ask
when
my
daughter
is
going
to
be
paid
*NL*
I
ca
n't
get
a
civil
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tossed
her
head
and
assumed
a
haughty
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
speak
to
the
secretary
.
It
's
not
my
business
.
I
'm
a
great
*NL*
fellow
fol-the-diddle-I-do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
a
lady
,
''
said
Mr.
Holohan
,
walking
away
from
her
*NL*
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
Mrs.
Kearney
's
conduct
was
condemned
on
all
hands
:
everyone
*NL*
approved
of
what
the
Committee
had
done
.
She
stood
at
the
door
,
haggard
*NL*
with
rage
,
arguing
with
her
husband
and
daughter
,
gesticulating
with
*NL*
them
.
She
waited
until
it
was
time
for
the
second
part
to
begin
in
the
*NL*
hope
that
the
secretaries
would
approach
her
.
But
Miss
Healy
had
kindly
*NL*
consented
to
play
one
or
two
accompaniments
.
Mrs.
Kearney
had
to
stand
*NL*
aside
to
allow
the
baritone
and
his
accompanist
to
pass
up
to
the
*NL*
platform
.
She
stood
still
for
an
instant
like
an
angry
stone
image
*NL*
and
,
when
the
first
notes
of
the
song
struck
her
ear
,
she
caught
up
her
*NL*
daughter
's
cloak
and
said
to
her
husband
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
a
cab
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
at
once
.
Mrs.
Kearney
wrapped
the
cloak
round
her
daughter
*NL*
and
followed
him
.
As
she
passed
through
the
doorway
she
stopped
and
*NL*
glared
into
Mr.
Holohan
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
done
with
you
yet
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'm
done
with
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Holohan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kathleen
followed
her
mother
meekly
.
Mr.
Holohan
began
to
pace
up
and
*NL*
down
the
room
,
in
order
to
cool
himself
for
he
his
skin
on
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
nice
lady
!
''
he
said
.
``
O
,
she
's
a
nice
lady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
the
proper
thing
,
Holohan
,
''
said
Mr.
O'Madden
Burke
,
poised
*NL*
upon
his
umbrella
in
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
GRACE
*NL*
*NL*
TWO
GENTLEMEN
who
were
in
the
lavatory
at
the
time
tried
to
lift
him
up
:
*NL*
but
he
was
quite
helpless
.
He
lay
curled
up
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
*NL*
down
which
he
had
fallen
.
They
succeeded
in
turning
him
over
.
His
hat
*NL*
had
rolled
a
few
yards
away
and
his
clothes
were
smeared
with
the
filth
*NL*
and
ooze
of
the
floor
on
which
he
had
lain
,
face
downwards
.
His
eyes
*NL*
were
closed
and
he
breathed
with
a
grunting
noise
.
A
thin
stream
of
*NL*
blood
trickled
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
gentlemen
and
one
of
the
curates
carried
him
up
the
stairs
*NL*
and
laid
him
down
again
on
the
floor
of
the
bar
.
In
two
minutes
he
was
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
men
.
The
manager
of
the
bar
asked
everyone
*NL*
who
he
was
and
who
was
with
him
.
No
one
knew
who
he
was
but
one
of
the
*NL*
curates
said
he
had
served
the
gentleman
with
a
small
rum
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
he
by
himself
?
''
asked
the
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
There
was
two
gentlemen
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
knew
;
a
voice
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
air
.
He
's
fainted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ring
of
onlookers
distended
and
closed
again
elastically
.
A
dark
*NL*
medal
of
blood
had
formed
itself
near
the
man
's
head
on
the
tessellated
*NL*
floor
.
The
manager
,
alarmed
by
the
grey
pallor
of
the
man
's
face
,
sent
*NL*
for
a
policeman
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
collar
was
unfastened
and
his
necktie
undone
.
He
opened
eyes
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
sighed
and
closed
them
again
.
One
of
gentlemen
who
had
carried
*NL*
him
upstairs
held
a
dinged
silk
hat
in
his
hand
.
The
manager
asked
*NL*
repeatedly
did
no
one
know
who
the
injured
man
was
or
where
had
his
*NL*
friends
gone
.
The
door
of
the
bar
opened
and
an
immense
constable
*NL*
entered
.
A
crowd
which
had
followed
him
down
the
laneway
collected
*NL*
outside
the
door
,
struggling
to
look
in
through
the
glass
panels
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
at
once
began
to
narrate
what
he
knew
.
The
constable
,
a
young
*NL*
man
with
thick
immobile
features
,
listened
.
He
moved
his
head
slowly
to
*NL*
right
and
left
and
from
the
manager
to
the
person
on
the
floor
,
as
if
*NL*
he
feared
to
be
the
victim
of
some
delusion
.
Then
he
drew
off
his
glove
,
*NL*
produced
a
small
book
from
his
waist
,
licked
the
lead
of
his
pencil
and
*NL*
made
ready
to
indite
.
He
asked
in
a
suspicious
provincial
accent
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
the
man
?
What
's
his
name
and
address
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
man
in
a
cycling-suit
cleared
his
way
through
the
ring
of
*NL*
bystanders
.
He
knelt
down
promptly
beside
the
injured
man
and
called
for
*NL*
water
.
The
constable
knelt
down
also
to
help
.
The
young
man
washed
the
*NL*
blood
from
the
injured
man
's
mouth
and
then
called
for
some
brandy
.
The
*NL*
constable
repeated
the
order
in
an
authoritative
voice
until
a
curate
*NL*
came
running
with
the
glass
.
The
brandy
was
forced
down
the
man
's
*NL*
throat
.
In
a
few
seconds
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
about
him
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
the
circle
of
faces
and
then
,
understanding
,
strove
to
rise
to
*NL*
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
all
right
now
?
''
asked
the
young
man
in
the
cycling-suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
,
's
nothing
,
''
said
the
injured
man
,
trying
to
stand
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
helped
to
his
feet
.
The
manager
said
something
about
a
hospital
*NL*
and
some
of
the
bystanders
gave
advice
.
The
battered
silk
hat
was
placed
*NL*
on
the
man
's
head
.
The
constable
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
,
without
answering
,
began
to
twirl
the
ends
of
his
moustache
.
*NL*
He
made
light
of
his
accident
.
It
was
nothing
,
he
said
:
only
a
little
*NL*
accident
.
He
spoke
very
thickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
live
?
''
repeated
the
constable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
said
they
were
to
get
a
cab
for
him
.
While
the
point
was
being
*NL*
debated
a
tall
agile
gentleman
of
fair
complexion
,
wearing
a
long
yellow
*NL*
ulster
,
came
from
the
far
end
of
the
bar
.
Seeing
the
spectacle
,
he
*NL*
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Tom
,
old
man
!
What
's
the
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
,
's
nothing
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new-comer
surveyed
the
deplorable
figure
before
him
and
then
turned
*NL*
to
the
constable
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
constable
.
I
'll
see
him
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
constable
touched
his
helmet
and
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
Mr.
Power
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
Tom
,
''
said
Mr.
Power
,
taking
his
friend
by
the
arm
.
``
No
bones
*NL*
broken
.
What
?
Can
you
walk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
in
the
cycling-suit
took
the
man
by
the
other
arm
and
the
*NL*
crowd
divided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
get
yourself
into
this
mess
?
''
asked
Mr.
Power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
fell
down
the
stairs
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'
`
ery
`
uch
o'liged
to
you
,
sir
,
''
said
the
injured
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
ant
we
have
a
little
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
now
.
Not
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
men
left
the
bar
and
the
crowd
sifted
through
the
doors
in
to
*NL*
the
laneway
.
The
manager
brought
the
constable
to
the
stairs
to
inspect
*NL*
the
scene
of
the
accident
.
They
agreed
that
the
gentleman
must
have
*NL*
missed
his
footing
.
The
customers
returned
to
the
counter
and
a
curate
*NL*
set
about
removing
the
traces
of
blood
from
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
out
into
Grafton
Street
,
Mr.
Power
whistled
for
an
*NL*
outsider
.
The
injured
man
said
again
as
well
as
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'
`
ery
`
uch
o'liged
to
you
,
sir
.
I
hope
we
'll
`
eet
again
.
'
y
na'e
is
*NL*
Kernan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shock
and
the
incipient
pain
had
partly
sobered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mention
it
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
shook
hands
.
Mr.
Kernan
was
hoisted
on
to
the
car
and
,
while
Mr.
*NL*
Power
was
giving
directions
to
the
carman
,
he
expressed
his
gratitude
*NL*
to
the
young
man
and
regretted
that
they
could
not
have
a
little
drink
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
time
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
car
drove
off
towards
Westmoreland
Street
.
As
it
passed
Ballast
*NL*
Office
the
clock
showed
half-past
nine
.
A
keen
east
wind
hit
them
,
*NL*
blowing
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
.
Mr.
Kernan
was
huddled
together
*NL*
with
cold
.
His
friend
asked
him
to
tell
how
the
accident
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
`
a
n't
`
an
,
''
he
answered
,
''
'
y
`
ongue
is
hurt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
leaned
over
the
well
of
the
car
and
peered
into
Mr.
Kernan
's
*NL*
mouth
but
he
could
not
see
.
He
struck
a
match
and
,
sheltering
it
in
the
*NL*
shell
of
his
hands
,
peered
again
into
the
mouth
which
Mr.
Kernan
opened
*NL*
obediently
.
The
swaying
movement
of
the
car
brought
the
match
to
and
*NL*
from
the
opened
mouth
.
The
lower
teeth
and
gums
were
covered
with
*NL*
clotted
blood
and
a
minute
piece
of
the
tongue
seemed
to
have
been
*NL*
bitten
off
.
The
match
was
blown
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
ugly
,
''
said
Mr.
Power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
,
's
nothing
,
''
said
Mr.
Kernan
,
closing
his
mouth
and
pulling
the
*NL*
collar
of
his
filthy
coat
across
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kernan
was
a
commercial
traveller
of
the
old
school
which
believed
*NL*
in
the
dignity
of
its
calling
.
He
had
never
been
seen
in
the
city
*NL*
without
a
silk
hat
of
some
decency
and
a
pair
of
gaiters
.
By
grace
of
*NL*
these
two
articles
of
clothing
,
he
said
,
a
man
could
always
pass
muster
.
*NL*
He
carried
on
the
tradition
of
his
Napoleon
,
the
great
Blackwhite
,
whose
*NL*
memory
he
evoked
at
times
by
legend
and
mimicry
.
Modern
business
methods
*NL*
had
spared
him
only
so
far
as
to
allow
him
a
little
office
in
Crowe
*NL*
Street
,
on
the
window
blind
of
which
was
written
the
name
of
his
firm
*NL*
with
the
address
--
London
,
E.
C.
On
the
mantelpiece
of
this
little
office
*NL*
a
little
leaden
battalion
of
canisters
was
drawn
up
and
on
the
table
*NL*
before
the
window
stood
four
or
five
china
bowls
which
were
usually
half
*NL*
full
of
a
black
liquid
.
From
these
bowls
Mr.
Kernan
tasted
tea
.
He
took
*NL*
a
mouthful
,
drew
it
up
,
saturated
his
palate
with
it
and
then
spat
it
*NL*
forth
into
the
grate
.
Then
he
paused
to
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Power
,
a
much
younger
man
,
was
employed
in
the
Royal
Irish
*NL*
Constabulary
Office
in
Dublin
Castle
.
The
arc
of
his
social
rise
*NL*
intersected
the
arc
of
his
friend
's
decline
,
but
Mr.
Kernan
's
decline
*NL*
was
mitigated
by
the
fact
that
certain
of
those
friends
who
had
known
*NL*
him
at
his
highest
point
of
success
still
esteemed
him
as
a
character
.
*NL*
Mr.
Power
was
one
of
these
friends
.
His
inexplicable
debts
were
a
byword
*NL*
in
his
circle
;
he
was
a
debonair
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
car
halted
before
a
small
house
on
the
Glasnevin
road
and
Mr.
Kernan
*NL*
was
helped
into
the
house
.
His
wife
put
him
to
bed
while
Mr.
Power
sat
*NL*
downstairs
in
the
kitchen
asking
the
children
where
they
went
to
school
*NL*
and
what
book
they
were
in
.
The
children
--
two
girls
and
a
boy
,
conscious
*NL*
of
their
father
's
helplessness
and
of
their
mother
's
absence
,
began
some
*NL*
horseplay
with
him
.
He
was
surprised
at
their
manners
and
at
their
*NL*
accents
,
and
his
brow
grew
thoughtful
.
After
a
while
Mrs.
Kernan
entered
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
exclaiming
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
sight
!
O
,
he
'll
do
for
himself
one
day
and
that
's
the
holy
alls
*NL*
of
it
.
He
's
been
drinking
since
Friday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Power
was
careful
to
explain
to
her
that
he
was
not
responsible
,
*NL*
that
he
had
come
on
the
scene
by
the
merest
accident
.
Mrs.
Kernan
,
*NL*
remembering
Mr.
Power
's
good
offices
during
domestic
quarrels
,
as
well
*NL*
as
many
small
,
but
opportune
loans
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
you
need
n't
tell
me
that
,
Mr.
Power
.
I
know
you
're
a
friend
of
his
,
*NL*
not
like
some
of
the
others
he
does
be
with
.
They
're
all
right
so
long
*NL*
as
he
has
money
in
his
pocket
to
keep
him
out
from
his
wife
and
family
.
*NL*
Nice
friends
!
Who
was
he
with
tonight
,
I
'd
like
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Power
shook
his
head
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
sorry
,
''
she
continued
,
``
that
I
've
nothing
in
the
house
to
offer
*NL*
you
.
But
if
you
wait
a
minute
I
'll
send
round
to
Fogarty
's
at
the
*NL*
corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Power
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
waiting
for
him
to
come
home
with
the
money
.
He
never
seems
to
*NL*
think
he
has
a
home
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
now
,
Mrs.
Kernan
,
''
said
Mr.
Power
,
``
we
'll
make
him
turn
over
a
new
*NL*
leaf
.
I
'll
talk
to
Martin
.
He
's
the
man
.
We
'll
come
here
one
of
these
*NL*
nights
and
talk
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
him
to
the
door
.
The
carman
was
stamping
up
and
down
the
*NL*
footpath
,
and
swinging
his
arms
to
warm
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
kind
of
you
to
bring
him
home
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Mr.
Power
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
on
the
car
.
As
it
drove
off
he
raised
his
hat
to
her
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
make
a
new
man
of
him
,
''
he
said
.
``
Good-night
,
Mrs.
Kernan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kernan
's
puzzled
eyes
watched
the
car
till
it
was
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
Then
she
withdrew
them
,
went
into
the
house
and
emptied
her
husband
's
*NL*
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
an
active
,
practical
woman
of
middle
age
.
Not
long
before
she
*NL*
had
celebrated
her
silver
wedding
and
renewed
her
intimacy
with
her
*NL*
husband
by
waltzing
with
him
to
Mr.
Power
's
accompaniment
.
In
her
days
*NL*
of
courtship
,
Mr.
Kernan
had
seemed
to
her
a
not
ungallant
figure
:
and
*NL*
she
still
hurried
to
the
chapel
door
whenever
a
wedding
was
reported
*NL*
and
,
seeing
the
bridal
pair
,
recalled
with
vivid
pleasure
how
she
had
*NL*
passed
out
of
the
Star
of
the
Sea
Church
in
Sandymount
,
leaning
on
the
*NL*
arm
of
a
jovial
well-fed
man
,
who
was
dressed
smartly
in
a
frock-coat
*NL*
and
lavender
trousers
and
carried
a
silk
hat
gracefully
balanced
upon
*NL*
his
other
arm
.
After
three
weeks
she
had
found
a
wife
's
life
irksome
*NL*
and
,
later
on
,
when
she
was
beginning
to
find
it
unbearable
,
she
had
*NL*
become
a
mother
.
The
part
of
mother
presented
to
her
no
insuperable
*NL*
difficulties
and
for
twenty-five
years
she
had
kept
house
shrewdly
for
*NL*
her
husband
.
Her
two
eldest
sons
were
launched
.
One
was
in
a
draper
's
*NL*
shop
in
Glasgow
and
the
other
was
clerk
to
a
tea-merchant
in
Belfast
.
*NL*
They
were
good
sons
,
wrote
regularly
and
sometimes
sent
home
money
.
The
*NL*
other
children
were
still
at
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kernan
sent
a
letter
to
his
office
next
day
and
remained
in
bed
.
She
*NL*
made
beef-tea
for
him
and
scolded
him
roundly
.
She
accepted
his
frequent
*NL*
intemperance
as
part
of
the
climate
,
healed
him
dutifully
whenever
he
*NL*
was
sick
and
always
tried
to
make
him
eat
a
breakfast
.
There
were
worse
*NL*
husbands
.
He
had
never
been
violent
since
the
boys
had
grown
up
,
and
she
*NL*
knew
that
he
would
walk
to
the
end
of
Thomas
Street
and
back
again
to
*NL*
book
even
a
small
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
nights
after
,
his
friends
came
to
see
him
.
She
brought
them
up
to
*NL*
his
bedroom
,
the
air
of
which
was
impregnated
with
a
personal
odour
,
*NL*
and
gave
them
chairs
at
the
fire
.
Mr.
Kernan
's
tongue
,
the
occasional
*NL*
stinging
pain
of
which
had
made
him
somewhat
irritable
during
the
day
,
*NL*
became
more
polite
.
He
sat
propped
up
in
the
bed
by
pillows
and
the
*NL*
little
colour
in
his
puffy
cheeks
made
them
resemble
warm
cinders
.
He
*NL*
apologised
to
his
guests
for
the
disorder
of
the
room
,
but
at
the
same
*NL*
time
looked
at
them
a
little
proudly
,
with
a
veteran
's
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
quite
unconscious
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
plot
which
his
*NL*
friends
,
Mr.
Cunningham
,
Mr.
M'Coy
and
Mr.
Power
had
disclosed
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Kernan
in
the
parlour
.
The
idea
had
been
Mr.
Power
's
,
but
its
development
*NL*
was
entrusted
to
Mr.
Cunningham
.
Mr.
Kernan
came
of
Protestant
stock
*NL*
and
,
though
he
had
been
converted
to
the
Catholic
faith
at
the
time
*NL*
of
his
marriage
,
he
had
not
been
in
the
pale
of
the
Church
for
twenty
*NL*
years
.
He
was
fond
,
moreover
,
of
giving
side-thrusts
at
Catholicism
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Cunningham
was
the
very
man
for
such
a
case
.
He
was
an
elder
*NL*
colleague
of
Mr.
Power
.
His
own
domestic
life
was
not
very
happy
.
People
*NL*
had
great
sympathy
with
him
,
for
it
was
known
that
he
had
married
an
*NL*
unpresentable
woman
who
was
an
incurable
drunkard
.
He
had
set
up
house
*NL*
for
her
six
times
;
and
each
time
she
had
pawned
the
furniture
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
had
respect
for
poor
Martin
Cunningham
.
He
was
a
thoroughly
*NL*
sensible
man
,
influential
and
intelligent
.
His
blade
of
human
knowledge
,
*NL*
natural
astuteness
particularised
by
long
association
with
cases
in
the
*NL*
police
courts
,
had
been
tempered
by
brief
immersions
in
the
waters
*NL*
of
general
philosophy
.
He
was
well
informed
.
His
friends
bowed
to
his
*NL*
opinions
and
considered
that
his
face
was
like
Shakespeare
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
plot
had
been
disclosed
to
her
,
Mrs.
Kernan
had
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
leave
it
all
in
your
hands
,
Mr.
Cunningham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
married
life
,
she
had
very
few
illusions
*NL*
left
.
Religion
for
her
was
a
habit
,
and
she
suspected
that
a
man
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
age
would
not
change
greatly
before
death
.
She
was
tempted
to
*NL*
see
a
curious
appropriateness
in
his
accident
and
,
but
that
she
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
seem
bloody-minded
,
would
have
told
the
gentlemen
that
*NL*
Mr.
Kernan
's
tongue
would
not
suffer
by
being
shortened
.
However
,
Mr.
*NL*
Cunningham
was
a
capable
man
;
and
religion
was
religion
.
The
scheme
*NL*
might
do
good
and
,
at
least
,
it
could
do
no
harm
.
Her
beliefs
were
*NL*
not
extravagant
.
She
believed
steadily
in
the
Sacred
Heart
as
the
*NL*
most
generally
useful
of
all
Catholic
devotions
and
approved
of
the
*NL*
sacraments
.
Her
faith
was
bounded
by
her
kitchen
,
but
,
if
she
was
put
to
*NL*
it
,
she
could
believe
also
in
the
banshee
and
in
the
Holy
Ghost
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
began
to
talk
of
the
accident
.
Mr.
Cunningham
said
that
he
*NL*
had
once
known
a
similar
case
.
A
man
of
seventy
had
bitten
off
a
piece
*NL*
of
his
tongue
during
an
epileptic
fit
and
the
tongue
had
filled
in
*NL*
again
,
so
that
no
one
could
see
a
trace
of
the
bite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
not
seventy
,
''
said
the
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
,
''
said
Mr.
Cunningham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
pain
you
now
?
''
asked
Mr.
M'Coy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
M'Coy
had
been
at
one
time
a
tenor
of
some
reputation
.
His
wife
,
who
*NL*
had
been
a
soprano
,
still
taught
young
children
to
play
the
piano
at
low
*NL*
terms
.
His
line
of
life
had
not
been
the
shortest
distance
between
two
*NL*
points
and
for
short
periods
he
had
been
driven
to
live
by
his
wits
.
He
*NL*
had
been
a
clerk
in
the
Midland
Railway
,
a
canvasser
for
advertisements
*NL*
for
The
Irish
Times
and
for
The
Freeman
's
Journal
,
a
town
traveller
*NL*
for
a
coal
firm
on
commission
,
a
private
inquiry
agent
,
a
clerk
in
the
*NL*
office
of
the
Sub-Sheriff
,
and
he
had
recently
become
secretary
to
the
*NL*
City
Coroner
.
His
new
office
made
him
professionally
interested
in
Mr.
*NL*
Kernan
's
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pain
?
Not
much
,
''
answered
Mr.
Kernan
.
``
But
it
's
so
sickening
.
I
feel
as
*NL*
if
I
wanted
to
retch
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the

Mr.

firmly

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Mr.
Kernan
.
``
I
think
I
caught
a

on

*NL*
something

phlegm

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

''
said
Mr.
M'Coy
,
``
that

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
Mr.
Cunningham
and
Mr.
Power
at
the
same
time
with
an
air
*NL*
of
challenge
.
Mr.
Cunningham
nodded
his
head
rapidly
and
Mr.
Power
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
all
's
well
that
ends
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
old
man
,
''
said
the
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Power
waved
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
other
two
fellows
I
was
with
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
were
you
with
?
''
asked
Mr.
Cunningham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
chap

I
do
n't
know
his
name

Damn
it
now
,
what
's
his
name

Little
*NL*
chap
with
sandy
hair
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
,
''
said
Mr.
Cunningham
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Cunningham
made
that
remark
,
people
were
silent
.
It
was
known
*NL*
that
the
speaker
had
secret
sources
of
information
.
In
this
case
the
*NL*
monosyllable
had
a
moral
intention
.
Mr.
Harford
sometimes
formed
one
*NL*
of
a
little
detachment
which
left
the
city
shortly
after
noon
on
Sunday
*NL*
with
the
purpose
of
arriving
as
soon
as
possible
at
some
public-house
on
*NL*
the
outskirts
of
the
city
where
its
members
duly
qualified
themselves
as
*NL*
bona
fide
travellers
.
But
his
fellow-travellers
had
never
consented
*NL*
to
overlook
his
origin
.
He
had
begun
life
as
an
obscure
financier
by
*NL*
lending
small
sums
of
money
to
workmen
at
usurious
interest
.
Later
on
he
*NL*
had
become
the
partner
of
a
very
fat
,
short
gentleman
,
Mr.
Goldberg
,
in
*NL*
the
Liffey
Loan
Bank
.
Though
he
had
never
embraced
more
than
the
Jewish
*NL*
ethical
code
,
his
fellow-Catholics
,
whenever
they
had
smarted
in
person
*NL*
or
by
proxy
under
his
exactions
,
spoke
of
him
bitterly
as
an
Irish
Jew
*NL*
and
an
illiterate
,
and
saw
divine
disapproval
of
usury
made
manifest
*NL*
through
the
person
of
his
idiot
son
.
At
other
times
they
remembered
his
*NL*
good
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
where
did
he
go
to
,
''
said
Mr.
Kernan
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wished
the
details
of
the
incident
to
remain
vague
.
He
wished
his
*NL*
friends
to
think
there
had
been
some
mistake
,
that
Mr.
Harford
and
he
*NL*
had
missed
each
other
.
His
friends
,
who
knew
quite
well
Mr.
Harford
's
*NL*
manners
in
drinking
were
silent
.
Mr.
Power
said
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
's
well
that
ends
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kernan
changed
the
subject
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
a
decent
young
chap
,
that
medical
fellow
,
''
he
said
.
``
Only
for
*NL*
him
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
only
for
him

''
said
Mr.
Power
,
``
it
might
have
been
a

of
seven
*NL*
days
,
without
the
option
of
a
fine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Kernan
,
trying
to
remember
.
``
I
remember
now
there
*NL*
was
a
policeman
.
Decent
young
fellow

he
seemed
.
How
did
it
happen
at
*NL*
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
happened
that
you
were
peloothered

Tom

''
said
Mr.
Cunningham
*NL*
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
bill

''
said
Mr.
Kernan
,
equally
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
squared
the
constable
,
Jack
,
''
said
Mr.
M'Coy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Power
did
not
relish
the
use
of
his
Christian
name
.
He
was
not
*NL*
straight-laced
,
but
he
could
not
forget
that
Mr.
M'Coy
had
recently
made
*NL*
a
crusade
in
search
of
valises
and
portmanteaus
to
enable
Mrs.
M'Coy
to
*NL*
fulfil
imaginary
engagements
in
the
country
.
More
than
he
resented
the
*NL*
fact
that
he
had
been
victimised
he
resented
such
low
playing
of
the
*NL*
game
.
He
answered
the
question
,
therefore
,
as
if
Mr.
Kernan
had
asked
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
narrative
made
Mr.
Kernan
indignant
.
He
was
keenly
conscious
of
his
*NL*
citizenship
,
wished
to
live
with
his
city
on
terms
mutually
honourable
*NL*
and
resented
any
affront
put
upon
him
by
those
whom
he
called
country
*NL*
bumpkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
what
we
pay
rates
for
?
''
he
asked
.
``
To
feed
and
clothe
these
*NL*
ignorant
bostooms
...
and
they
're
nothing
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Cunningham
laughed
.
He
was
a
Castle
official
only
during
office
*NL*
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
they
be
anything
else
,
Tom
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
assumed
a
thick
,
provincial
accent
and
said
in
a
tone
of
command
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
65
,
catch
your
cabbage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
laughed
.
Mr.
M'Coy
,
who
wanted
to
enter
the
conversation
by
any
*NL*
door
,
pretended
that
he
had
never
heard
the
story
.
Mr.
Cunningham
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
supposed
--
they
say
,
you
know
--
to
take
place
in
the
depot
where
*NL*
they
get
these
thundering
big
country
fellows
,
omadhauns
,
you
know
,
to
*NL*
drill
.
The
sergeant
makes
them
stand
in
a
row
against
the
wall
and
hold
*NL*
up
their
plates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
illustrated
the
story
by
grotesque
gestures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
dinner
,
you
know
.
Then
he
has
a
bloody
big
bowl
of
cabbage
before
*NL*
him
on
the
table
and
a
bloody
big
spoon
like
a
shovel
.
He
takes
up
a
wad
*NL*
of
cabbage
on
the
spoon
and
pegs
it
across
the
room
and
the
poor
devils
*NL*
have
to
try
and
catch
it
on
their
plates
:
65
,
catch
your
cabbage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
laughed
again
:
but
Mr.
Kernan
was
somewhat
indignant
still
.
He
*NL*
talked
of
writing
a
letter
to
the
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
yahoos
coming
up
here
,
''
he
said
,
``
think
they
can
boss
the
people

*NL*
I
need
n't
tell
you
,
Martin
,
what
kind
of

they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Cunningham
gave
a
qualified
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
everything
else
in
this

he
said
.
``
You
get
some

ones

you
get
some
good

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
you
get
some
good
ones
,
I
admit

''
said
Mr.
Kernan
,
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
better
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
them

''
said
Mr.
M'Coy
.
``
That
's
my
*NL*
opinion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kernan
entered
the
room
and
,
placing
a
tray
on
the
table
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
yourselves
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Power
stood
up
to
officiate
,
offering
her
his
chair
.
She
declined
*NL*
it
,
saying
she
was
ironing
downstairs
,
and
,
after
having
exchanged
a
nod
*NL*
with
Mr.
Cunningham
behind
Mr.
Power
's
back
,
prepared
to
leave
the
room
.
*NL*
Her
husband
called
out
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
nothing
for
me
,
duckie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
you
!
The
back
of
my
hand
to
you
!
''
said
Mrs.
Kernan
tartly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
called
after
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
for
poor
little
hubby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
assumed
such
a
comical
face
and
voice
that
the
distribution
of
the
*NL*
bottles
of
stout
took
place
amid
general
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
drank
from
their
glasses
,
set
the
glasses
again
on
the
*NL*
table
and
paused
.
Then
Mr.
Cunningham
turned
towards
Mr.
Power
and
said
*NL*
casually
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Thursday
night
,
you
said
,
Jack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thursday
,
yes

said
Mr.
Power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Righto

''
said
Mr.
Cunningham
promptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
meet
in
M'Auley

said
Mr.
M'Coy
.
``
That
'll
be
the
most
*NL*
convenient
place

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
must
n't
be
late
,
''
said
Mr.
Power
earnestly
,
``
because
it
is
sure
*NL*
to
be
crammed
to
the
doors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
meet
at
half-seven

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-seven

M'Auley

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
short
silence
.
Mr.
Kernan
waited
to
see
whether
he
would
be
*NL*
taken
into
his
friends
'
confidence
.
Then
he
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
in
the
wind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
it
's
nothing

''
said
Mr.
Cunningham
.
``
It
's
only
a

we
're
arranging
about

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

said
Mr.
Kernan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

''
said
Mr.
Cunningham
in
an
evasive
tone
,
``
it
's
just
a
little

*NL*
spiritual
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
''
said
Mr.
Kernan
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
again
.
Then
Mr.
Power
said
,
point
blank
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
you
the
truth

Tom
,
we
're
going
to
make

retreat

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that

it

said
Mr.
Cunningham
,
``
Jack

I
and
M'Coy
here

we
're
*NL*
all
going
to
wash
the
pot

*NL*
*NL*
He
uttered
the
metaphor
with
a
certain
homely
energy
and
,
encouraged
by
*NL*
his
own
voice
,
proceeded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see

we
may
as
well
all
admit

a
nice
collection

scoundrels

all

I
say
,
one

he
added
with
gruff
*NL*
charity
and
turning
to
Mr.
Power
.
``
Own
up
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
own
up

said
Mr.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
own
up

said
Mr.
M'Coy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
're
going
to
wash
the
pot
together

''
said
Mr.
Cunningham
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
.
He
turned
suddenly
to
the
invalid
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'ye
know
what

Tom

has
just
occurred

You
night
join

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

.
``
The
four

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kernan
was
silent
.
The
proposal
conveyed
very
little
meaning
to
*NL*
his
mind
,
but
,
understanding
that
some
spiritual
agencies
were
about
to
*NL*
concern
themselves
on
his
behalf
,
he
thought
he
owed
it
to
his
dignity
*NL*
to
show
a
stiff
neck
.
He
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
for
a
long
*NL*
while
,
but
listened
,
with
an
air
of
calm
enmity
,
while
his
friends
*NL*
discussed
the
Jesuits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
such
a

he
said

intervening
at

length

The

Mr.

*NL*
seemed
to
be
weighing
something
in

mind

He
was
impressed

He
had

high
opinion
of

said
Mr.

quietly

effectively

``
our

*NL*

``

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.

came
to
the
door
of

and
announced
:

Here

A
pale

oval
face
came
forward
into
the
light

The
arch
of
its
fair
*NL*
trailing
moustache
was
repeated
in
the
fair
eyebrows
looped
above
*NL*
pleasantly
astonished
eyes
.
Mr.
Fogarty
was
a
modest
grocer
.
He
had
*NL*
failed
in
business
in
a
licensed
house
in
the
city
because
his
financial
*NL*
condition
had
constrained
him
to
tie
himself
to
second-class
distillers
*NL*
and
brewers
.
He
had
opened
a
small
shop
on
Glasnevin
Road
where
,
he
*NL*
flattered
himself
,
his
manners
would
ingratiate
him
with
the
housewives
*NL*
of
the
district
.
He
bore
himself
with
a
certain
grace
,
complimented
*NL*
little
children
and
spoke
with
a
neat
enunciation
.
He
was
not
without
*NL*
culture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Fogarty
brought
a
gift
with
him
,
a
half-pint
of
special
whisky
.
He
*NL*
inquired
politely
for
Mr.
Kernan
,
placed
his
gift
on
the
table
and
sat
*NL*
down
with
the
company
on
equal
terms
.
Mr.
Kernan
appreciated
the
gift
*NL*
all
the
more
since
he
was
aware
that
there
was
a
small
account
for
*NL*
groceries
unsettled
between
him
and
Mr.
Fogarty
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
doubt

Open
that

Jack

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Power
again
officiated
.
Glasses
were
rinsed
and
five
small
*NL*
measures
of
whisky
were
poured
out
.
This
new
influence
enlivened
the
*NL*
conversation
.
Mr.
Fogarty
,
sitting
on
a
small
area
of
the
chair
,
was
*NL*
specially
interested

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

positively

allowed

contentedly

shook

Mr.

made
an

recall

addressed

a

pleaded

The

accepted

The
light
music

falling

made
an

agreeable
interlude

them
as
it
*NL*
uttered
the
word
of
belief
and
submission
.
When
Mrs.
Kernan
came
into
*NL*
the
room
,
drying
her
hands
she
came
into
a
solemn
company
.
She
did
not
*NL*
disturb
the
silence
,
but
leaned
over
the
rail
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
once
saw
John
MacHale
,
''
said
Mr.
Kernan
,
``
and
I
'll
never
forget
it
as
*NL*
long
as
I
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
towards
his
wife
to
be
confirmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
often
told
you
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kernan
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
at
the
unveiling
of
Sir
John
Gray
's
statue
.
Edmund
Dwyer
*NL*
Gray
was
speaking
,
blathering
away
,
and
here
was
this
old
fellow
,
*NL*
crabbed-looking
old
chap
,
looking
at
him
from
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kernan
knitted
his
brows
and
,
lowering
his
head
like
an
angry
bull
,
*NL*
glared
at
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
resuming
his
natural
face
,
``
I
never
saw
such
an
eye
*NL*
in
a
man
's
head
.
It
was
as
much
as
to
say
:
I
have
you
properly
taped
,
my
*NL*
lad
.
He
had
an
eye
like
a
hawk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
of
the
Grays
was
any
good
,
''
said
Mr.
Power
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
again
.
Mr.
Power
turned
to
Mrs.
Kernan
and
said
with
*NL*
abrupt
joviality
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mrs.
Kernan
,
we
're
going
to
make
your
man
here
a
good
holy
pious
*NL*
and
God-fearing
Roman
Catholic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
swept
his
arm
round
the
company
inclusively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
all
going
to
make
a
retreat
together
and
confess
our
sins
--
and
*NL*
God
knows
we
want
it
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
,
''
said
Mr.
Kernan
,
smiling
a
little
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kernan
thought
it
would
be
wiser
to
conceal
her
satisfaction
.
So
*NL*
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pity
the
poor
priest
that
has
to
listen
to
your
tale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kernan
's
expression
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
does
n't
like
it
,
''
he
said
bluntly
,
``
he
can
...
do
the
other
thing
.
*NL*
I
'll
just
tell
him
my
little
tale
of
woe
.
I
'm
not
such
a
bad
fellow
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Cunningham
intervened
promptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
all
renounce
the
devil
,
''
he
said
,
``
together
,
not
forgetting
his
*NL*
works
and
pomps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
behind
me
,
Satan
!
''
said
Mr.
Fogarty
,
laughing
and
looking
at
the
*NL*
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Power
said
nothing
.
He
felt
completely
out-generalled
.
But
a
pleased
*NL*
expression
flickered
across
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
we
have
to
do
,
''
said
Mr.
Cunningham
,
``
is
to
stand
up
with
lighted
*NL*
candles
in
our
hands
and
renew
our
baptismal
vows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
do
n't
forget
the
candle
,
Tom
,
''
said
Mr.
M'Coy
,
``
whatever
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Mr.
Kernan
.
``
Must
I
have
a
candle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Cunningham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
damn
it
all
,
''
said
Mr.
Kernan
sensibly
,
``
I
draw
the
line
there
.
*NL*
I
'll
do
the
job
right
enough
.
I
'll
do
the
retreat
business
and
*NL*
confession
,
and
...
all
that
business
.
But
...
no
candles
!
No
,
damn
it
*NL*
all
,
I
bar
the
candles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
with
farcical
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
that
!
''
said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bar
the
candles
,
''
said
Mr.
Kernan
,
conscious
of
having
created
an
*NL*
effect
on
his
audience
and
continuing
to
shake
his
head
to
and
fro
.
``
I
*NL*
bar
the
magic-lantern
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
laughed
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
nice
Catholic
for
you
!
''
said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
candles
!
''
repeated
Mr.
Kernan
obdurately
.
``
That
's
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
transept
of
the
Jesuit
Church
in
Gardiner
Street
was
almost
full
;
*NL*
and
still
at
every
moment
gentlemen
entered
from
the
side
door
and
,
*NL*
directed
by
the
lay-brother
,
walked
on
tiptoe
along
the
aisles
until
*NL*
they
found
seating
accommodation
.
The
gentlemen
were
all
well
dressed
*NL*
and
orderly
.
The
light
of
the
lamps
of
the
church
fell
upon
an
assembly
*NL*
of
black
clothes
and
white
collars
,
relieved
here
and
there
by
tweeds
,
*NL*
on
dark
mottled
pillars
of
green
marble
and
on
lugubrious
canvases
.
The
*NL*
gentlemen
sat
in
the
benches
,
having
hitched
their
trousers
slightly
*NL*
above
their
knees
and
laid
their
hats
in
security
.
They
sat
well
back
*NL*
and
gazed
formally
at
the
distant
speck
of
red
light
which
was
suspended
*NL*
before
the
high
altar
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
the
benches
near
the
pulpit
sat
Mr.
Cunningham
and
Mr.
Kernan
.
*NL*
In
the
bench
behind
sat
Mr.
M'Coy
alone
:
and
in
the
bench
behind
him
sat
*NL*
Mr.
Power
and
Mr.
Fogarty
.
Mr.
M'Coy
had
tried
unsuccessfully
to
find
a
*NL*
place
in
the
bench
with
the
others
,
and
,
when
the
party
had
settled
down
*NL*
in
the
form
of
a
quincunx
,
he
had
tried
unsuccessfully
to
make
comic
*NL*
remarks
.
As
these
had
not
been
well
received
,
he
had
desisted
.
Even
he
*NL*
was
sensible
of
the
decorous
atmosphere
and
even
he
began
to
respond
to
*NL*
the
religious
stimulus
.
In
a
whisper
,
Mr.
Cunningham
drew
Mr.
Kernan
's
*NL*
attention
to
Mr.
Harford
,
the
moneylender
,
who
sat
some
distance
off
,
*NL*
and
to
Mr.
Fanning
,
the
registration
agent
and
mayor
maker
of
the
city
,
*NL*
who
was
sitting
immediately
under
the
pulpit
beside
one
of
the
newly
*NL*
elected
councillors
of
the
ward
.
To
the
right
sat
old
Michael
Grimes
,
*NL*
the
owner
of
three
pawnbroker
's
shops
,
and
Dan
Hogan
's
nephew
,
who
was
*NL*
up
for
the
job
in
the
Town
Clerk
's
office
.
Farther
in
front
sat
*NL*
Mr.
Hendrick
,
the
chief
reporter
of
The
Freeman
's
Journal
,
and
poor
*NL*
O'Carroll
,
an
old
friend
of
Mr.
Kernan
's
,
who
had
been
at
one
time
a
*NL*
considerable
commercial
figure
.
Gradually
,
as
he
recognised
familiar
*NL*
faces
,
Mr.
Kernan
began
to
feel
more
at
home
.
His
hat
,
which
had
been
*NL*
rehabilitated
by
his
wife
,
rested
upon
his
knees
.
Once
or
twice
he
*NL*
pulled
down
his
cuffs
with
one
hand
while
he
held
the
brim
of
his
hat
*NL*
lightly
,
but
firmly
,
with
the
other
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
powerful-looking
figure
,
the
upper
part
of
which
was
draped
with
*NL*
a
white
surplice
,
was
observed
to
be
struggling
into
the
pulpit
.
*NL*
Simultaneously
the
congregation
unsettled
,
produced
handkerchiefs
and
*NL*
knelt
upon
them
with
care
.
Mr.
Kernan
followed
the
general
example
.
The
*NL*
priest
's
figure
now
stood
upright
in
the
pulpit
,
two-thirds
of
its
bulk
,
*NL*
crowned
by
a
massive
red
face
,
appearing
above
the
balustrade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Purdon
knelt
down
,
turned
towards
the
red
speck
of
light
*NL*
and
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
,
prayed
.
After
an
interval
,
he
*NL*
uncovered
his
face
and
rose
.
The
congregation
rose
also
and
settled
*NL*
again
on
its
benches
.
Mr.
Kernan
restored
his
hat
to
its
original
*NL*
position
on
his
knee
and
presented
an
attentive
face
to
the
preacher
.
*NL*
The
preacher
turned
back
each
wide
sleeve
of
his
surplice
with
an
*NL*
elaborate
large
gesture
and
slowly
surveyed
the
array
of
faces
.
Then
he
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
children
of
this
world
are
wiser
in
their
generation
than
the
*NL*
children
of
light
.
Wherefore
make
unto
yourselves
friends
out
of
the
*NL*
mammon
of
iniquity
so
that
when
you
die
they
may
receive
you
into
*NL*
everlasting
dwellings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Purdon
developed
the
text
with
resonant
assurance
.
It
was
one
of
*NL*
the
most
difficult
texts
in
all
the
Scriptures
,
he
said
,
to
interpret
*NL*
properly
.
It
was
a
text
which
might
seem
to
the
casual
observer
at
*NL*
variance
with
the
lofty
morality
elsewhere
preached
by
Jesus
Christ
.
*NL*
But
,
he
told
his
hearers
,
the
text
had
seemed
to
him
specially
adapted
*NL*
for
the
guidance
of
those
whose
lot
it
was
to
lead
the
life
of
the
world
*NL*
and
who
yet
wished
to
lead
that
life
not
in
the
manner
of
worldlings
.
It
*NL*
was
a
text
for
business
men
and
professional
men
.
Jesus
Christ
,
with
His
*NL*
divine
understanding
of
every
cranny
of
our
human
nature
,
understood
*NL*
that
all
men
were
not
called
to
the
religious
life
,
that
by
far
the
vast
*NL*
majority
were
forced
to
live
in
the
world
,
and
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
*NL*
for
the
world
:
and
in
this
sentence
He
designed
to
give
them
a
word
of
*NL*
counsel
,
setting
before
them
as
exemplars
in
the
religious
life
those
*NL*
very
worshippers
of
Mammon
who
were
of
all
men
the
least
solicitous
in
*NL*
matters
religious
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
his
hearers
that
he
was
there
that
evening
for
no
terrifying
,
*NL*
no
extravagant
purpose
;
but
as
a
man
of
the
world
speaking
to
his
*NL*
fellow-men
.
He
came
to
speak
to
business
men
and
he
would
speak
to
them
*NL*
in
a
businesslike
way
.
If
he
might
use
the
metaphor
,
he
said
,
he
was
*NL*
their
spiritual
accountant
;
and
he
wished
each
and
every
one
of
his
*NL*
hearers
to
open
his
books
,
the
books
of
his
spiritual
life
,
and
see
if
*NL*
they
tallied
accurately
with
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jesus
Christ
was
not
a
hard
taskmaster
.
He
understood
our
little
*NL*
failings
,
understood
the
weakness
of
our
poor
fallen
nature
,
understood
*NL*
the
temptations
of
this
life
.
We
might
have
had
,
we
all
had
from
time
to
*NL*
time
,
our
temptations
:
we
might
have
,
we
all
had
,
our
failings
.
But
one
*NL*
thing
only
,
he
said
,
he
would
ask
of
his
hearers
.
And
that
was
:
to
be
*NL*
straight
and
manly
with
God
.
If
their
accounts
tallied
in
every
point
to
*NL*
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
verified
my
accounts
.
I
find
all
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
,
as
might
happen
,
there
were
some
discrepancies
,
to
admit
the
*NL*
truth
,
to
be
frank
and
say
like
a
man
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
looked
into
my
accounts
.
I
find
this
wrong
and
this
wrong
.
*NL*
But
,
with
God
's
grace
,
I
will
rectify
this
and
this
.
I
will
set
right
my
*NL*
accounts
.

*NL*
THE
DEAD
*NL*
*NL*
LILY
,
the
caretaker
's
daughter
,
was
literally
run
off
her
feet
.
Hardly
*NL*
had
she
brought
one
gentleman
into
the
little
pantry
behind
the
office
*NL*
on
the
ground
floor
and
helped
him
off
with
his
overcoat
than
the
wheezy
*NL*
hall-door
bell
clanged
again
and
she
had
to
scamper
along
the
bare
*NL*
hallway
to
let
in
another
guest
.
It
was
well
for
her
she
had
not
to
*NL*
attend
to
the
ladies
also
.
But
Miss
Kate
and
Miss
Julia
had
thought
*NL*
of
that
and
had
converted
the
bathroom
upstairs
into
a
ladies
'
*NL*
dressing-room
.
Miss
Kate
and
Miss
Julia
were
there
,
gossiping
and
*NL*
laughing
and
fussing
,
walking
after
each
other
to
the
head
of
the
*NL*
stairs
,
peering
down
over
the
banisters
and
calling
down
to
Lily
to
ask
*NL*
her
who
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
always
a
great
affair
,
the
Misses
Morkan
's
annual
dance
.
*NL*
Everybody
who
knew
them
came
to
it
,
members
of
the
family
,
old
friends
*NL*
of
the
family
,
the
members
of
Julia
's
choir
,
any
of
Kate
's
pupils
that
*NL*
were
grown
up
enough
,
and
even
some
of
Mary
Jane
's
pupils
too
.
Never
*NL*
once
had
it
fallen
flat
.
For
years
and
years
it
had
gone
off
in
splendid
*NL*
style
,
as
long
as
anyone
could
remember
;
ever
since
Kate
and
Julia
,
*NL*
after
the
death
of
their
brother
Pat
,
had
left
the
house
in
Stoney
*NL*
Batter
and
taken
Mary
Jane
,
their
only
niece
,
to
live
with
them
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
gaunt
house
on
Usher
's
Island
,
the
upper
part
of
which
they
had
*NL*
rented
from
Mr.
Fulham
,
the
corn-factor
on
the
ground
floor
.
That
was
a
*NL*
good
thirty
years
ago
if
it
was
a
day
.
Mary
Jane
,
who
was
then
a
little
*NL*
girl
in
short
clothes
,
was
now
the
main
prop
of
the
household
,
for
she
*NL*
had
the
organ
in
Haddington
Road
.
She
had
been
through
the
Academy
*NL*
and
gave
a
pupils
'
concert
every
year
in
the
upper
room
of
the
Antient
*NL*
Concert
Rooms
.
Many
of
her
pupils
belonged
to
the
better-class
families
*NL*
on
the
Kingstown
and
Dalkey
line
.
Old
as
they
were
,
her
aunts
also
did
*NL*
their
share
.
Julia
,
though
she
was
quite
grey
,
was
still
the
leading
*NL*
soprano
in
Adam
and
Eve
's
,
and
Kate
,
being
too
feeble
to
go
about
much
,
*NL*
gave
music
lessons
to
beginners
on
the
old
square
piano
in
the
back
*NL*
room
.
Lily
,
the
caretaker
's
daughter
,
did
housemaid
's
work
for
them
.
*NL*
Though
their
life
was
modest
,
they
believed
in
eating
well
;
the
best
*NL*
of
everything
:
diamond-bone
sirloins
,
three-shilling
tea
and
the
best
*NL*
bottled
stout
.
But
Lily
seldom
made
a
mistake
in
the
orders
,
so
that
she
*NL*
got
on
well
with
her
three
mistresses
.
They
were
fussy
,
that
was
all
.
*NL*
But
the
only
thing
they
would
not
stand
was
back
answers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
they
had
good
reason
to
be
fussy
on
such
a
night
.
And
then
it
*NL*
was
long
after
ten
o'clock
and
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
Gabriel
and
his
*NL*
wife
.
Besides
they
were
dreadfully
afraid
that
Freddy
Malins
might
*NL*
turn
up
screwed
.
They
would
not
wish
for
worlds
that
any
of
Mary
Jane
's
*NL*
pupils
should
see
him
under
the
influence
;
and
when
he
was
like
that
it
*NL*
was
sometimes
very
hard
to
manage
him
.
Freddy
Malins
always
came
late
,
*NL*
but
they
wondered
what
could
be
keeping
Gabriel
:
and
that
was
what
*NL*
brought
them
every
two
minutes
to
the
banisters
to
ask
Lily
had
Gabriel
*NL*
or
Freddy
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Mr.
Conroy
,
''
said
Lily
to
Gabriel
when
she
opened
the
door
for
him
,
*NL*
``
Miss
Kate
and
Miss
Julia
thought
you
were
never
coming
.
Good-night
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Conroy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
engage
they
did
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
``
but
they
forget
that
my
wife
here
*NL*
takes
three
mortal
hours
to
dress
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
on
the
mat
,
scraping
the
snow
from
his
goloshes
,
while
Lily
led
*NL*
his
wife
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Kate
,
here
's
Mrs.
Conroy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kate
and
Julia
came
toddling
down
the
dark
stairs
at
once
.
Both
of
them
*NL*
kissed
Gabriel
's
wife
,
said
she
must
be
perished
alive
,
and
asked
was
*NL*
Gabriel
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
as
right
as
the
mail
,
Aunt
Kate
!
Go
on
up
.
I
'll
follow
,
''
*NL*
called
out
Gabriel
from
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
scraping
his
feet
vigorously
while
the
three
women
went
*NL*
upstairs
,
laughing
,
to
the
ladies
'
dressing-room
.
A
light
fringe
of
snow
*NL*
lay
like
a
cape
on
the
shoulders
of
his
overcoat
and
like
toecaps
on
the
*NL*
toes
of
his
goloshes
;
and
,
as
the
buttons
of
his
overcoat
slipped
with
a
*NL*
squeaking
noise
through
the
snow-stiffened
frieze
,
a
cold
,
fragrant
air
*NL*
from
out-of-doors
escaped
from
crevices
and
folds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
snowing
again
,
Mr.
Conroy
?
''
asked
Lily
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
preceded
him
into
the
pantry
to
help
him
off
with
his
overcoat
.
*NL*
Gabriel
smiled
at
the
three
syllables
she
had
given
his
surname
and
*NL*
glanced
at
her
.
She
was
a
slim
,
growing
girl
,
pale
in
complexion
and
*NL*
with
hay-coloured
hair
.
The
gas
in
the
pantry
made
her
look
still
paler
.
*NL*
Gabriel
had
known
her
when
she
was
a
child
and
used
to
sit
on
the
lowest
*NL*
step
nursing
a
rag
doll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Lily
,
''
he
answered
,
``
and
I
think
we
're
in
for
a
night
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
at
the
pantry
ceiling
,
which
was
shaking
with
the
stamping
*NL*
and
shuffling
of
feet
on
the
floor
above
,
listened
for
a
moment
to
*NL*
the
piano
and
then
glanced
at
the
girl
,
who
was
folding
his
overcoat
*NL*
carefully
at
the
end
of
a
shelf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
.
Lily
,
''
he
said
in
a
friendly
tone
,
``
do
you
still
go
to
*NL*
school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
sir
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
'm
done
schooling
this
year
and
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
then
,
''
said
Gabriel
gaily
,
``
I
suppose
we
'll
be
going
to
your
wedding
*NL*
one
of
these
fine
days
with
your
young
man
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
glanced
back
at
him
over
her
shoulder
and
said
with
great
*NL*
bitterness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
men
that
is
now
is
only
all
palaver
and
what
they
can
get
out
of
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
coloured
,
as
if
he
felt
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
,
without
*NL*
looking
at
her
,
kicked
off
his
goloshes
and
flicked
actively
with
his
*NL*
muffler
at
his
patent-leather
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
stout
,
tallish
young
man
.
The
high
colour
of
his
cheeks
*NL*
pushed
upwards
even
to
his
forehead
,
where
it
scattered
itself
in
a
*NL*
few
formless
patches
of
pale
red
;
and
on
his
hairless
face
there
*NL*
scintillated
restlessly
the
polished
lenses
and
the
bright
gilt
rims
of
*NL*
the
glasses
which
screened
his
delicate
and
restless
eyes
.
His
glossy
*NL*
black
hair
was
parted
in
the
middle
and
brushed
in
a
long
curve
behind
*NL*
his
ears
where
it
curled
slightly
beneath
the
groove
left
by
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
flicked
lustre
into
his
shoes
he
stood
up
and
pulled
his
*NL*
waistcoat
down
more
tightly
on
his
plump
body
.
Then
he
took
a
coin
*NL*
rapidly
from
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lily
,
''
he
said
,
thrusting
it
into
her
hands
,
``
it
's
Christmastime
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
?
Just
...
here
's
a
little
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
rapidly
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
sir
!
''
cried
the
girl
,
following
him
.
``
Really
,
sir
,
I
would
n't
*NL*
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christmas-time
!
Christmas-time
!
''
said
Gabriel
,
almost
trotting
to
the
*NL*
stairs
and
waving
his
hand
to
her
in
deprecation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
,
seeing
that
he
had
gained
the
stairs
,
called
out
after
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
thank
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
outside
the
drawing-room
door
until
the
waltz
should
finish
,
*NL*
listening
to
the
skirts
that
swept
against
it
and
to
the
shuffling
of
*NL*
feet
.
He
was
still
discomposed
by
the
girl
's
bitter
and
sudden
retort
.
*NL*
It
had
cast
a
gloom
over
him
which
he
tried
to
dispel
by
arranging
his
*NL*
cuffs
and
the
bows
of
his
tie
.
He
then
took
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
*NL*
little
paper
and
glanced
at
the
headings
he
had
made
for
his
speech
.
He
*NL*
was
undecided
about
the
lines
from
Robert
Browning
,
for
he
feared
they
*NL*
would
be
above
the
heads
of
his
hearers
.
Some
quotation
that
they
would
*NL*
recognise
from
Shakespeare
or
from
the
Melodies
would
be
better
.
The
*NL*
indelicate
clacking
of
the
men
's
heels
and
the
shuffling
of
their
soles
*NL*
reminded
him
that
their
grade
of
culture
differed
from
his
.
He
would
*NL*
only
make
himself
ridiculous
by
quoting
poetry
to
them
which
they
*NL*
could
not
understand
.
They
would
think
that
he
was
airing
his
superior
*NL*
education
.
He
would
fail
with
them
just
as
he
had
failed
with
the
girl
*NL*
in
the
pantry
.
He
had
taken
up
a
wrong
tone
.
His
whole
speech
was
a
*NL*
mistake
from
first
to
last
,
an
utter
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
his
aunts
and
his
wife
came
out
of
the
ladies
'
dressing-room
.
*NL*
His
aunts
were
two
small
,
plainly
dressed
old
women
.
Aunt
Julia
was
an
*NL*
inch
or
so
the
taller
.
Her
hair
,
drawn
low
over
the
tops
of
her
ears
,
*NL*
was
grey
;
and
grey
also
,
with
darker
shadows
,
was
her
large
flaccid
*NL*
face
.
Though
she
was
stout
in
build
and
stood
erect
,
her
slow
eyes
and
*NL*
parted
lips
gave
her
the
appearance
of
a
woman
who
did
not
know
where
*NL*
she
was
or
where
she
was
going
.
Aunt
Kate
was
more
vivacious
.
Her
*NL*
face
,
healthier
than
her
sister
's
,
was
all
puckers
and
creases
,
like
a
*NL*
shrivelled
red
apple
,
and
her
hair
,
braided
in
the
same
old-fashioned
*NL*
way
,
had
not
lost
its
ripe
nut
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
kissed
Gabriel
frankly
.
He
was
their
favourite
nephew
,
the
son
*NL*
of
their
dead
elder
sister
,
Ellen
,
who
had
married
T.
J.
Conroy
of
the
*NL*
Port
and
Docks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gretta
tells
me
you
're
not
going
to
take
a
cab
back
to
Monkstown
*NL*
tonight
,
Gabriel
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
turning
to
his
wife
,
``
we
had
quite
enough
of
that
*NL*
last
year
,
had
n't
we
?
Do
n't
you
remember
,
Aunt
Kate
,
what
a
cold
Gretta
*NL*
got
out
of
it
?
Cab
windows
rattling
all
the
way
,
and
the
east
wind
*NL*
blowing
in
after
we
passed
Merrion
.
Very
jolly
it
was
.
Gretta
caught
a
*NL*
dreadful
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Kate
frowned
severely
and
nodded
her
head
at
every
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
Gabriel
,
quite
right
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
ca
n't
be
too
*NL*
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
for
Gretta
there
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
``
she
'd
walk
home
in
the
snow
if
*NL*
she
were
let
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Conroy
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
him
,
Aunt
Kate
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
's
really
an
awful
bother
,
*NL*
what
with
green
shades
for
Tom
's
eyes
at
night
and
making
him
do
the
*NL*
dumb-bells
,
and
forcing
Eva
to
eat
the
stirabout
.
The
poor
child
!
And
*NL*
she
simply
hates
the
sight
of
it
!
...
O
,
but
you
'll
never
guess
what
he
*NL*
makes
me
wear
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
out
into
a
peal
of
laughter
and
glanced
at
her
husband
,
whose
*NL*
admiring
and
happy
eyes
had
been
wandering
from
her
dress
to
her
face
*NL*
and
hair
.
The
two
aunts
laughed
heartily
,
too
,
for
Gabriel
's
solicitude
*NL*
was
a
standing
joke
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goloshes
!
''
said
Mrs.
Conroy
.
``
That
's
the
latest
.
Whenever
it
's
wet
*NL*
underfoot
I
must
put
on
my
galoshes
.
Tonight
even
,
he
wanted
me
to
put
*NL*
them
on
,
but
I
would
n't
.
The
next
thing
he
'll
buy
me
will
be
a
diving
*NL*
suit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
laughed
nervously
and
patted
his
tie
reassuringly
,
while
Aunt
*NL*
Kate
nearly
doubled
herself
,
so
heartily
did
she
enjoy
the
joke
.
The
*NL*
smile
soon
faded
from
Aunt
Julia
's
face
and
her
mirthless
eyes
were
*NL*
directed
towards
her
nephew
's
face
.
After
a
pause
she
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
goloshes
,
Gabriel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goloshes
,
Julia
!
''
exclaimed
her
sister
``
Goodness
me
,
do
n't
you
know
*NL*
what
goloshes
are
?
You
wear
them
over
your
...
over
your
boots
,
Gretta
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Conroy
.
``
Guttapercha
things
.
We
both
have
a
pair
now
.
*NL*
Gabriel
says
everyone
wears
them
on
the
Continent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
on
the
Continent
,
''
murmured
Aunt
Julia
,
nodding
her
head
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
knitted
his
brows
and
said
,
as
if
he
were
slightly
angered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
very
wonderful
,
but
Gretta
thinks
it
very
funny
because
*NL*
she
says
the
word
reminds
her
of
Christy
Minstrels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
,
Gabriel
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
,
with
brisk
tact
.
``
Of
course
,
*NL*
you
've
seen
about
the
room
.
Gretta
was
saying
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
the
room
is
all
right
,
''
replied
Gabriel
.
``
I
've
taken
one
in
the
*NL*
Gresham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
,
``
by
far
the
best
thing
to
do
.
And
the
*NL*
children
,
Gretta
,
you
're
not
anxious
about
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
for
one
night
,
''
said
Mrs.
Conroy
.
``
Besides
,
Bessie
will
look
after
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
again
.
``
What
a
comfort
it
is
to
have
a
girl
*NL*
like
that
,
one
you
can
depend
on
!
There
's
that
Lily
,
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
has
come
over
her
lately
.
She
's
not
the
girl
she
was
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
was
about
to
ask
his
aunt
some
questions
on
this
point
,
but
she
*NL*
broke
off
suddenly
to
gaze
after
her
sister
,
who
had
wandered
down
the
*NL*
stairs
and
was
craning
her
neck
over
the
banisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
ask
you
,
''
she
said
almost
testily
,
``
where
is
Julia
going
?
Julia
!
*NL*
Julia
!
Where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julia
,
who
had
gone
half
way
down
one
flight
,
came
back
and
announced
*NL*
blandly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Freddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
a
clapping
of
hands
and
a
final
flourish
of
the
*NL*
pianist
told
that
the
waltz
had
ended
.
The
drawing-room
door
was
opened
*NL*
from
within
and
some
couples
came
out
.
Aunt
Kate
drew
Gabriel
aside
*NL*
hurriedly
and
whispered
into
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slip
down
,
Gabriel
,
like
a
good
fellow
and
see
if
he
's
all
right
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
let
him
up
if
he
's
screwed
.
I
'm
sure
he
's
screwed
.
I
'm
sure
he
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
went
to
the
stairs
and
listened
over
the
banisters
.
He
could
*NL*
hear
two
persons
talking
in
the
pantry
.
Then
he
recognised
Freddy
*NL*
Malins
'
laugh
.
He
went
down
the
stairs
noisily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
such
a
relief
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
to
Mrs.
Conroy
,
``
that
Gabriel
is
*NL*
here
.
I
always
feel
easier
in
my
mind
when
he
's
here

Julia
,
there
's
*NL*
Miss
Daly
and
Miss
Power
will
take
some
refreshment
.
Thanks
for
your
*NL*
beautiful
waltz
,
Miss
Daly
.
It
made
lovely
time
.

*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
wizen-faced
man
,
with
a
stiff
grizzled
moustache
and
swarthy
*NL*
skin
,
who
was
passing
out
with
his
partner
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
may
we
have
some
refreshment
,
too
,
Miss
Morkan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julia
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
summarily
,
``
and
here
's
Mr.
Browne
and
Miss
*NL*
Furlong
.
Take
them
in
,
Julia
,
with
Miss
Daly
and
Miss
Power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
the
man
for
the
ladies
,
''
said
Mr.
Browne
,
pursing
his
lips
until
*NL*
his
moustache
bristled
and
smiling
in
all
his
wrinkles
.
``
You
know
,
Miss
*NL*
Morkan
,
the
reason
they
are
so
fond
of
me
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
his
sentence
,
but
,
seeing
that
Aunt
Kate
was
out
of
*NL*
earshot
,
at
once
led
the
three
young
ladies
into
the
back
room
.
The
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
two
square
tables
placed
end
to
*NL*
end
,
and
on
these
Aunt
Julia
and
the
caretaker
were
straightening
*NL*
and
smoothing
a
large
cloth
.
On
the
sideboard
were
arrayed
dishes
and
*NL*
plates
,
and
glasses
and
bundles
of
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
.
The
top
*NL*
of
the
closed
square
piano
served
also
as
a
sideboard
for
viands
*NL*
and
sweets
.
At
a
smaller
sideboard
in
one
corner
two
young
men
were
*NL*
standing
,
drinking
hop-bitters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Browne
led
his
charges
thither
and
invited
them
all
,
in
jest
,
to
*NL*
some
ladies
'
punch
,
hot
,
strong
and
sweet
.
As
they
said
they
never
took
*NL*
anything
strong
,
he
opened
three
bottles
of
lemonade
for
them
.
Then
*NL*
he
asked
one
of
the
young
men
to
move
aside
,
and
,
taking
hold
of
the
*NL*
decanter
,
filled
out
for
himself
a
goodly
measure
of
whisky
.
The
young
*NL*
men
eyed
him
respectfully
while
he
took
a
trial
sip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
help
me
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
,
``
it
's
the
doctor
's
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
wizened
face
broke
into
a
broader
smile
,
and
the
three
young
ladies
*NL*
laughed
in
musical
echo
to
his
pleasantry
,
swaying
their
bodies
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
with
nervous
jerks
of
their
shoulders
.
The
boldest
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
now
,
Mr.
Browne
,
I
'm
sure
the
doctor
never
ordered
anything
of
the
*NL*
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Browne
took
another
sip
of
his
whisky
and
said
,
with
sidling
*NL*
mimicry
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
I
'm
like
the
famous
Mrs.
Cassidy
,
who
is
reported
to
*NL*
have
said
:
`
Now
,
Mary
Grimes
,
if
I
do
n't
take
it
,
make
me
take
it
,
for
I
*NL*
feel
I
want
it
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hot
face
had
leaned
forward
a
little
too
confidentially
and
he
had
*NL*
assumed
a
very
low
Dublin
accent
so
that
the
young
ladies
,
with
one
*NL*
instinct
,
received
his
speech
in
silence
.
Miss
Furlong
,
who
was
one
*NL*
of
Mary
Jane
's
pupils
,
asked
Miss
Daly
what
was
the
name
of
the
pretty
*NL*
waltz
she
had
played
;
and
Mr.
Browne
,
seeing
that
he
was
ignored
,
turned
*NL*
promptly
to
the
two
young
men
who
were
more
appreciative
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
red-faced
young
woman
,
dressed
in
pansy
,
came
into
the
room
,
excitedly
*NL*
clapping
her
hands
and
crying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quadrilles
!
Quadrilles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Close
on
her
heels
came
Aunt
Kate
,
crying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
gentlemen
and
three
ladies
,
Mary
Jane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
here
's
Mr.
Bergin
and
Mr.
Kerrigan
,
''
said
Mary
Jane
.
``
Mr.
Kerrigan
,
*NL*
will
you
take
Miss
Power
?
Miss
Furlong
,
may
I
get
you
a
partner
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bergin
.
O
,
that
'll
just
do
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
ladies
,
Mary
Jane
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
young
gentlemen
asked
the
ladies
if
they
might
have
the
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
Mary
Jane
turned
to
Miss
Daly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Miss
Daly
,
you
're
really
awfully
good
,
after
playing
for
the
last
*NL*
two
dances
,
but
really
we
're
so
short
of
ladies
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
in
the
least
,
Miss
Morkan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
've
a
nice
partner
for
you
,
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
,
the
tenor
.
I
'll
*NL*
get
him
to
sing
later
on
.
All
Dublin
is
raving
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lovely
voice
,
lovely
voice
!
''
said
Aunt
Kate
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
piano
had
twice
begun
the
prelude
to
the
first
figure
Mary
Jane
*NL*
led
her
recruits
quickly
from
the
room
.
They
had
hardly
gone
when
Aunt
*NL*
Julia
wandered
slowly
into
the
room
,
looking
behind
her
at
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
Julia
?
''
asked
Aunt
Kate
anxiously
.
``
Who
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Julia
,
who
was
carrying
in
a
column
of
table-napkins
,
turned
to
her
*NL*
sister
and
said
,
simply
,
as
if
the
question
had
surprised
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
Freddy
,
Kate
,
and
Gabriel
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
right
behind
her
Gabriel
could
be
seen
piloting
Freddy
Malins
*NL*
across
the
landing
.
The
latter
,
a
young
man
of
about
forty
,
was
of
*NL*
Gabriel
's
size
and
build
,
with
very
round
shoulders
.
His
face
was
fleshy
*NL*
and
pallid
,
touched
with
colour
only
at
the
thick
hanging
lobes
of
his
*NL*
ears
and
at
the
wide
wings
of
his
nose
.
He
had
coarse
features
,
a
*NL*
blunt
nose
,
a
convex
and
receding
brow
,
tumid
and
protruded
lips
.
His
*NL*
heavy-lidded
eyes
and
the
disorder
of
his
scanty
hair
made
him
look
*NL*
sleepy
.
He
was
laughing
heartily
in
a
high
key
at
a
story
which
he
had
*NL*
been
telling
Gabriel
on
the
stairs
and
at
the
same
time
rubbing
the
*NL*
knuckles
of
his
left
fist
backwards
and
forwards
into
his
left
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
,
Freddy
,
''
said
Aunt
Julia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Freddy
Malins
bade
the
Misses
Morkan
good-evening
in
what
seemed
an
*NL*
offhand
fashion
by
reason
of
the
habitual
catch
in
his
voice
and
then
,
*NL*
seeing
that
Mr.
Browne
was
grinning
at
him
from
the
sideboard
,
crossed
*NL*
the
room
on
rather
shaky
legs
and
began
to
repeat
in
an
undertone
the
*NL*
story
he
had
just
told
to
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
so
bad
,
is
he
?
''
said
Aunt
Kate
to
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
's
brows
were
dark
but
he
raised
them
quickly
and
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
no
,
hardly
noticeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
is
n't
he
a
terrible
fellow
!
''
she
said
.
``
And
his
poor
mother
made
*NL*
him
take
the
pledge
on
New
Year
's
Eve
.
But
come
on
,
Gabriel
,
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
leaving
the
room
with
Gabriel
she
signalled
to
Mr.
Browne
by
*NL*
frowning
and
shaking
her
forefinger
in
warning
to
and
fro
.
Mr.
Browne
*NL*
nodded
in
answer
and
,
when
she
had
gone
,
said
to
Freddy
Malins
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
Teddy
,
I
'm
going
to
fill
you
out
a
good
glass
of
lemonade
*NL*
just
to
buck
you
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Freddy
Malins
,
who
was
nearing
the
climax
of
his
story
,
waved
the
offer
*NL*
aside
impatiently
but
Mr.
Browne
,
having
first
called
Freddy
Malins
'
*NL*
attention
to
a
disarray
in
his
dress
,
filled
out
and
handed
him
a
*NL*
full
glass
of
lemonade
.
Freddy
Malins
'
left
hand
accepted
the
*NL*
glass
mechanically
,
his
right
hand
being
engaged
in
the
mechanical
*NL*
readjustment
of
his
dress
.
Mr.
Browne
,
whose
face
was
once
more
*NL*
wrinkling
with
mirth
,
poured
out
for
himself
a
glass
of
whisky
while
*NL*
Freddy
Malins
exploded
,
before
he
had
well
reached
the
climax
of
his
*NL*
story
,
in
a
kink
of
high-pitched
bronchitic
laughter
and
,
setting
down
*NL*
his
untasted
and
overflowing
glass
,
began
to
rub
the
knuckles
of
his
*NL*
left
fist
backwards
and
forwards
into
his
left
eye
,
repeating
words
of
*NL*
his
last
phrase
as
well
as
his
fit
of
laughter
would
allow
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
could
not
listen
while
Mary
Jane
was
playing
her
Academy
piece
,
*NL*
full
of
runs
and
difficult
passages
,
to
the
hushed
drawing-room
.
He
*NL*
liked
music
but
the
piece
she
was
playing
had
no
melody
for
him
and
he
*NL*
doubted
whether
it
had
any
melody
for
the
other
listeners
,
though
they
*NL*
had
begged
Mary
Jane
to
play
something
.
Four
young
men
,
who
had
come
*NL*
from
the
refreshment-room
to
stand
in
the
doorway
at
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
piano
,
had
gone
away
quietly
in
couples
after
a
few
minutes
.
The
only
*NL*
persons
who
seemed
to
follow
the
music
were
Mary
Jane
herself
,
her
hands
*NL*
racing
along
the
key-board
or
lifted
from
it
at
the
pauses
like
those
*NL*
of
a
priestess
in
momentary
imprecation
,
and
Aunt
Kate
standing
at
her
*NL*
elbow
to
turn
the
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
's
eyes
,
irritated
by
the
floor
,
which
glittered
with
beeswax
*NL*
under
the
heavy
chandelier
,
wandered
to
the
wall
above
the
piano
.
A
*NL*
picture
of
the
balcony
scene
in
Romeo
and
Juliet
hung
there
and
beside
*NL*
it
was
a
picture
of
the
two
murdered
princes
in
the
Tower
which
Aunt
*NL*
Julia
had
worked
in
red
,
blue
and
brown
wools
when
she
was
a
girl
.
*NL*
Probably
in
the
school
they
had
gone
to
as
girls
that
kind
of
work
had
*NL*
been
taught
for
one
year
.
His
mother
had
worked
for
him
as
a
birthday
*NL*
present
a
waistcoat
of
purple
tabinet
,
with
little
foxes
'
heads
upon
it
,
*NL*
lined
with
brown
satin
and
having
round
mulberry
buttons
.
It
was
strange
*NL*
that
his
mother
had
had
no
musical
talent
though
Aunt
Kate
used
to
call
*NL*
her
the
brains
carrier
of
the
Morkan
family
.
Both
she
and
Julia
had
*NL*
always
seemed
a
little
proud
of
their
serious
and
matronly
sister
.
Her
*NL*
photograph
stood
before
the
pierglass
.
She
held
an
open
book
on
her
*NL*
knees
and
was
pointing
out
something
in
it
to
Constantine
who
,
dressed
*NL*
in
a
man-o-war
suit
,
lay
at
her
feet
.
It
was
she
who
had
chosen
the
name
*NL*
of
her
sons
for
she
was
very
sensible
of
the
dignity
of
family
life
.
*NL*
Thanks
to
her
,
Constantine
was
now
senior
curate
in
Balbrigan
and
,
*NL*
thanks
to
her
,
Gabriel
himself
had
taken
his
degree
in
the
Royal
*NL*
University
.
A
shadow
passed
over
his
face
as
he
remembered
her
sullen
*NL*
opposition
to
his
marriage
.
Some
slighting
phrases
she
had
used
still
*NL*
rankled
in
his
memory
;
she
had
once
spoken
of
Gretta
as
being
country
*NL*
cute
and
that
was
not
true
of
Gretta
at
all
.
It
was
Gretta
who
had
*NL*
nursed
her
during
all
her
last
long
illness
in
their
house
at
Monkstown
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
that
Mary
Jane
must
be
near
the
end
of
her
piece
for
she
was
*NL*
playing
again
the
opening
melody
with
runs
of
scales
after
every
bar
and
*NL*
while
he
waited
for
the
end
the
resentment
died
down
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
The
piece
ended
with
a
trill
of
octaves
in
the
treble
and
a
final
deep
*NL*
octave
in
the
bass
.
Great
applause
greeted
Mary
Jane
as
,
blushing
and
*NL*
rolling
up
her
music
nervously
,
she
escaped
from
the
room
.
The
most
*NL*
vigorous
clapping
came
from
the
four
young
men
in
the
doorway
who
had
*NL*
gone
away
to
the
refreshment-room
at
the
beginning
of
the
piece
but
had
*NL*
come
back
when
the
piano
had
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lancers
were
arranged
.
Gabriel
found
himself
partnered
with
Miss
Ivors
.
*NL*
She
was
a
frank-mannered
talkative
young
lady
,
with
a
freckled
face
and
*NL*
prominent
brown
eyes
.
She
did
not
wear
a
low-cut
bodice
and
the
large
*NL*
brooch
which
was
fixed
in
the
front
of
her
collar
bore
on
it
an
Irish
*NL*
device
and
motto
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
taken
their
places
she
said
abruptly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
crow
to
pluck
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
?
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
her
head
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
Gabriel
,
smiling
at
her
solemn
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
G.
C.
?
''
answered
Miss
Ivors
,
turning
her
eyes
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
coloured
and
was
about
to
knit
his
brows
,
as
if
he
did
not
*NL*
understand
,
when
she
said
bluntly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
innocent
Amy
!
I
have
found
out
that
you
write
for
The
Daily
Express
.
*NL*
Now
,
are
n't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
be
ashamed
of
myself
?
''
asked
Gabriel
,
blinking
his
eyes
*NL*
and
trying
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
ashamed
of
you
,
''
said
Miss
Ivors
frankly
.
``
To
say
you
'd
write
*NL*
for
a
paper
like
that
.
I
did
n't
think
you
were
a
West
Briton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
look
of
perplexity
appeared
on
Gabriel
's
face
.
It
was
true
that
he
*NL*
wrote
a
literary
column
every
Wednesday
in
The
Daily
Express
,
for
which
*NL*
he
was
paid
fifteen
shillings
.
But
that
did
not
make
him
a
West
Briton
*NL*
surely
.
The
books
he
received
for
review
were
almost
more
welcome
than
*NL*
the
paltry
cheque
.
He
loved
to
feel
the
covers
and
turn
over
the
pages
*NL*
of
newly
printed
books
.
Nearly
every
day
when
his
teaching
in
the
*NL*
college
was
ended
he
used
to
wander
down
the
quays
to
the
second-hand
*NL*
booksellers
,
to
Hickey
's
on
Bachelor
's
Walk
,
to
Web
's
or
Massey
's
on
*NL*
Aston
's
Quay
,
or
to
O'Clohissey
's
in
the
by-street
.
He
did
not
know
how
*NL*
to
meet
her
charge
.
He
wanted
to
say
that
literature
was
above
politics
.
*NL*
But
they
were
friends
of
many
years
'
standing
and
their
careers
had
been
*NL*
parallel
,
first
at
the
University
and
then
as
teachers
:
he
could
not
*NL*
risk
a
grandiose
phrase
with
her
.
He
continued
blinking
his
eyes
and
*NL*
trying
to
smile
and
murmured
lamely
that
he
saw
nothing
political
in
*NL*
writing
reviews
of
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
their
turn
to
cross
had
come
he
was
still
perplexed
and
*NL*
inattentive
.
Miss
Ivors
promptly
took
his
hand
in
a
warm
grasp
and
said
*NL*
in
a
soft
friendly
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
was
only
joking
.
Come
,
we
cross
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
together
again
she
spoke
of
the
University
question
and
*NL*
Gabriel
felt
more
at
ease
.
A
friend
of
hers
had
shown
her
his
review
*NL*
of
Browning
's
poems
.
That
was
how
she
had
found
out
the
secret
:
but
she
*NL*
liked
the
review
immensely
.
Then
she
said
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Mr.
Conroy
,
will
you
come
for
an
excursion
to
the
Aran
Isles
this
*NL*
summer
?
We
're
going
to
stay
there
a
whole
month
.
It
will
be
splendid
*NL*
out
in
the
Atlantic
.
You
ought
to
come
.
Mr.
Clancy
is
coming
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Kilkelly
and
Kathleen
Kearney
.
It
would
be
splendid
for
Gretta
too
if
*NL*
she
'd
come
.
She
's
from
Connacht
,
is
n't
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
people
are
,
''
said
Gabriel
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
come
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
said
Miss
Ivors
,
laying
her
warm
hand
*NL*
eagerly
on
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
``
I
have
just
arranged
to
go
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
where
?
''
asked
Miss
Ivors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
every
year
I
go
for
a
cycling
tour
with
some
fellows
*NL*
and
so
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
?
''
asked
Miss
Ivors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
usually
go
to
France
or
Belgium
or
perhaps
Germany
,
''
said
*NL*
Gabriel
awkwardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
do
you
go
to
France
and
Belgium
,
''
said
Miss
Ivors
,
``
instead
of
*NL*
visiting
your
own
land
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
``
it
's
partly
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
languages
*NL*
and
partly
for
a
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
n't
you
your
own
language
to
keep
in
touch
with
--
Irish
?
''
asked
*NL*
Miss
Ivors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
``
if
it
comes
to
that
,
you
know
,
Irish
is
not
my
*NL*
language
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
neighbours
had
turned
to
listen
to
the
cross-examination
.
Gabriel
*NL*
glanced
right
and
left
nervously
and
tried
to
keep
his
good
humour
under
*NL*
the
ordeal
which
was
making
a
blush
invade
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
n't
you
your
own
land
to
visit
,
''
continued
Miss
Ivors
,
``
that
*NL*
you
know
nothing
of
,
your
own
people
,
and
your
own
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
''
retorted
Gabriel
suddenly
,
``
I
'm
sick
of
my
*NL*
own
country
,
sick
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
asked
Miss
Ivors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
did
not
answer
for
his
retort
had
heated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
repeated
Miss
Ivors
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
to
go
visiting
together
and
,
as
he
had
not
answered
her
,
Miss
*NL*
Ivors
said
warmly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
you
've
no
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
tried
to
cover
his
agitation
by
taking
part
in
the
dance
with
*NL*
great
energy
.
He
avoided
her
eyes
for
he
had
seen
a
sour
expression
on
*NL*
her
face
.
But
when
they
met
in
the
long
chain
he
was
surprised
to
feel
*NL*
his
hand
firmly
pressed
.
She
looked
at
him
from
under
her
brows
for
a
*NL*
moment
quizzically
until
he
smiled
.
Then
,
just
as
the
chain
was
about
to
*NL*
start
again
,
she
stood
on
tiptoe
and
whispered
into
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
West
Briton
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
lancers
were
over
Gabriel
went
away
to
a
remote
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
where
Freddy
Malins
'
mother
was
sitting
.
She
was
a
stout
feeble
old
*NL*
woman
with
white
hair
.
Her
voice
had
a
catch
in
it
like
her
son
's
and
*NL*
she
stuttered
slightly
.
She
had
been
told
that
Freddy
had
come
and
that
*NL*
he
was
nearly
all
right
.
Gabriel
asked
her
whether
she
had
had
a
good
*NL*
crossing
.
She
lived
with
her
married
daughter
in
Glasgow
and
came
to
*NL*
Dublin
on
a
visit
once
a
year
.
She
answered
placidly
that
she
had
had
a
*NL*
beautiful
crossing
and
that
the
captain
had
been
most
attentive
to
her
.
*NL*
She
spoke
also
of
the
beautiful
house
her
daughter
kept
in
Glasgow
,
and
*NL*
of
all
the
friends
they
had
there
.
While
her
tongue
rambled
on
Gabriel
*NL*
tried
to
banish
from
his
mind
all
memory
of
the
unpleasant
incident
with
*NL*
Miss
Ivors
.
Of
course
the
girl
or
woman
,
or
whatever
she
was
,
was
an
*NL*
enthusiast
but
there
was
a
time
for
all
things
.
Perhaps
he
ought
not
*NL*
to
have
answered
her
like
that
.
But
she
had
no
right
to
call
him
a
West
*NL*
Briton
before
people
,
even
in
joke
.
She
had
tried
to
make
him
ridiculous
*NL*
before
people
,
heckling
him
and
staring
at
him
with
her
rabbit
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
his
wife
making
her
way
towards
him
through
the
waltzing
couples
.
*NL*
When
she
reached
him
she
said
into
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabriel
,
Aunt
Kate
wants
to
know
wo
n't
you
carve
the
goose
as
usual
.
*NL*
Miss
Daly
will
carve
the
ham
and
I
'll
do
the
pudding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
sending
in
the
younger
ones
first
as
soon
as
this
waltz
is
over
*NL*
so
that
we
'll
have
the
table
to
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
dancing
?
''
asked
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
was
.
Did
n't
you
see
me
?
What
row
had
you
with
Molly
Ivors
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
row
.
Why
?
Did
she
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
like
that
.
I
'm
trying
to
get
that
Mr.
D'Arcy
to
sing
.
He
's
*NL*
full
of
conceit
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
row
,
''
said
Gabriel
moodily
,
``
only
she
wanted
me
to
go
for
*NL*
a
trip
to
the
west
of
Ireland
and
I
said
I
would
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
clasped
her
hands
excitedly
and
gave
a
little
jump
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
do
go
,
Gabriel
,
''
she
cried
.
``
I
'd
love
to
see
Galway
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
go
if
you
like
,
''
said
Gabriel
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
,
then
turned
to
Mrs.
Malins
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
nice
husband
for
you
,
Mrs.
Malins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
threading
her
way
back
across
the
room
Mrs.
Malins
,
*NL*
without
adverting
to
the
interruption
,
went
on
to
tell
Gabriel
what
*NL*
beautiful
places
there
were
in
Scotland
and
beautiful
scenery
.
Her
*NL*
son-in-law
brought
them
every
year
to
the
lakes
and
they
used
to
go
*NL*
fishing
.
Her
son-in-law
was
a
splendid
fisher
.
One
day
he
caught
a
*NL*
beautiful
big
fish
and
the
man
in
the
hotel
cooked
it
for
their
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
hardly
heard
what
she
said
.
Now
that
supper
was
coming
near
he
*NL*
began
to
think
again
about
his
speech
and
about
the
quotation
.
When
he
*NL*
saw
Freddy
Malins
coming
across
the
room
to
visit
his
mother
Gabriel
*NL*
left
the
chair
free
for
him
and
retired
into
the
embrasure
of
the
*NL*
window
.
The
room
had
already
cleared
and
from
the
back
room
came
the
*NL*
clatter
of
plates
and
knives
.
Those
who
still
remained
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
seemed
tired
of
dancing
and
were
conversing
quietly
in
little
*NL*
groups
.
Gabriel
's
warm
trembling
fingers
tapped
the
cold
pane
of
the
*NL*
window
.
How
cool
it
must
be
outside
!
How
pleasant
it
would
be
to
walk
*NL*
out
alone
,
first
along
by
the
river
and
then
through
the
park
!
The
snow
*NL*
would
be
lying
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
forming
a
bright
cap
on
*NL*
the
top
of
the
Wellington
Monument
.
How
much
more
pleasant
it
would
be
*NL*
there
than
at
the
supper-table
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
over
the
headings
of
his
speech
:
Irish
hospitality
,
sad
memories
,
*NL*
the
Three
Graces
,
Paris
,
the
quotation
from
Browning
.
He
repeated
to
*NL*
himself
a
phrase
he
had
written
in
his
review
:
``
One
feels
that
one
is
*NL*
listening
to
a
thought-tormented
music
.
''
Miss
Ivors
had
praised
the
*NL*
review
.
Was
she
sincere
?
Had
she
really
any
life
of
her
own
behind
all
*NL*
her
propagandism
?
There
had
never
been
any
ill-feeling
between
them
*NL*
until
that
night
.
It
unnerved
him
to
think
that
she
would
be
at
the
*NL*
supper-table
,
looking
up
at
him
while
he
spoke
with
her
critical
*NL*
quizzing
eyes
.
Perhaps
she
would
not
be
sorry
to
see
him
fail
in
his
*NL*
speech
.
An
idea
came
into
his
mind
and
gave
him
courage
.
He
would
*NL*
say
,
alluding
to
Aunt
Kate
and
Aunt
Julia
:
``
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
,
the
*NL*
generation
which
is
now
on
the
wane
among
us
may
have
had
its
faults
but
*NL*
for
my
part
I
think
it
had
certain
qualities
of
hospitality
,
of
humour
,
*NL*
of
humanity
,
which
the
new
and
very
serious
and
hypereducated
generation
*NL*
that
is
growing
up
around
us
seems
to
me
to
lack
.
''
Very
good
:
that
*NL*
was
one
for
Miss
Ivors
.
What
did
he
care
that
his
aunts
were
only
two
*NL*
ignorant
old
women
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
murmur
in
the
room
attracted
his
attention
.
Mr.
Browne
was
advancing
*NL*
from
the
door
,
gallantly
escorting
Aunt
Julia
,
who
leaned
upon
his
arm
,
*NL*
smiling
and
hanging
her
head
.
An
irregular
musketry
of
applause
escorted
*NL*
her
also
as
far
as
the
piano
and
then
,
as
Mary
Jane
seated
herself
on
*NL*
the
stool
,
and
Aunt
Julia
,
no
longer
smiling
,
half
turned
so
as
to
pitch
*NL*
her
voice
fairly
into
the
room
,
gradually
ceased
.
Gabriel
recognised
*NL*
the
prelude
.
It
was
that
of
an
old
song
of
Aunt
Julia
's
--
Arrayed
for
the
*NL*
Bridal
.
Her
voice
,
strong
and
clear
in
tone
,
attacked
with
great
spirit
*NL*
the
runs
which
embellish
the
air
and
though
she
sang
very
rapidly
she
*NL*
did
not
miss
even
the
smallest
of
the
grace
notes
.
To
follow
the
*NL*
voice
,
without
looking
at
the
singer
's
face
,
was
to
feel
and
share
the
*NL*
excitement
of
swift
and
secure
flight
.
Gabriel
applauded
loudly
with
all
*NL*
the
others
at
the
close
of
the
song
and
loud
applause
was
borne
in
from
*NL*
the
invisible
supper-table
.
It
sounded
so
genuine
that
a
little
*NL*
colour
struggled
into
Aunt
Julia
's
face
as
she
bent
to
replace
in
the
*NL*
music-stand
the
old
leather-bound
songbook
that
had
her
initials
on
the
*NL*
cover
.
Freddy
Malins
,
who
had
listened
with
his
head
perched
sideways
to
*NL*
hear
her
better
,
was
still
applauding
when
everyone
else
had
ceased
and
*NL*
talking
animatedly
to
his
mother
who
nodded
her
head
gravely
and
slowly
*NL*
in
acquiescence
.
At
last
,
when
he
could
clap
no
more
,
he
stood
up
*NL*
suddenly
and
hurried
across
the
room
to
Aunt
Julia
whose
hand
he
seized
*NL*
and
held
in
both
his
hands
,
shaking
it
when
words
failed
him
or
the
*NL*
catch
in
his
voice
proved
too
much
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
telling
my
mother
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
never
heard
you
sing
so
*NL*
well
,
never
.
No
,
I
never
heard
your
voice
so
good
as
it
is
tonight
.
Now
!
*NL*
Would
you
believe
that
now
?
That
's
the
truth
.
Upon
my
word
and
honour
*NL*
that
's
the
truth
.
I
never
heard
your
voice
sound
so
fresh
and
so
...
so
*NL*
clear
and
fresh
,
never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Julia
smiled
broadly
and
murmured
something
about
compliments
as
*NL*
she
released
her
hand
from
his
grasp
.
Mr.
Browne
extended
his
open
*NL*
hand
towards
her
and
said
to
those
who
were
near
him
in
the
manner
of
a
*NL*
showman
introducing
a
prodigy
to
an
audience
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Julia
Morkan
,
my
latest
discovery
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
laughing
very
heartily
at
this
himself
when
Freddy
Malins
turned
*NL*
to
him
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Browne
,
if
you
're
serious
you
might
make
a
worse
discovery
.
All
*NL*
I
can
say
is
I
never
heard
her
sing
half
so
well
as
long
as
I
am
coming
*NL*
here
.
And
that
's
the
honest
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
did
I
,
''
said
Mr.
Browne
.
``
I
think
her
voice
has
greatly
*NL*
improved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Julia
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
with

*NL*
``
Thirty
years
ago
I
had
n't
a
bad
voice
as
voices
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
often
told
Julia
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
emphatically
,
``
that
she
was
simply
*NL*
thrown
away
in
that
choir

But
she
never
would
be
said
by
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
as
if
to
appeal
to
the
good
sense
of
the
others
against
a
*NL*
refractory
child
while
Aunt
Julia
gazed
in
front
of
her
,
a
vague
smile
*NL*
of
reminiscence
playing
on
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
continued
Aunt
Kate
,
``
she
would
n't
be
said

led
by
anyone

slaving
there
in
that
choir
night

day
,
night
and
day

Six
o'clock
on
*NL*
Christmas
morning
!
And
all
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
is
n't
it
for
the
honour
of
God
,
Aunt
Kate
?
''
asked
Mary
Jane
,
*NL*
twisting
round
on
the
piano-stool
and
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Kate
turned
fiercely
on
her
niece
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
all
about
the
honour
of
God
,
Mary
Jane
,
but
I
think
it
's
not
at
*NL*
all
honourable
for
the
pope
to
turn
out
the
women
out
of
the
choirs
that
*NL*
have
slaved
there
all
their
lives
and
put
little
whipper-snappers
of
*NL*
boys
over
their
heads
.
I
suppose
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
Church
if
the
*NL*
pope
does
it
.
But
it
's
not
just
,
Mary
Jane
,
and
it
's
not
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
worked
herself
into
a
passion
and
would
have
continued
in
*NL*
defence
of
her
sister
for
it
was
a
sore
subject
with
her
but
Mary
Jane
,
*NL*
seeing
that
all
the
dancers
had
come
back
,
intervened
pacifically
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Aunt
Kate
,
you
're
giving
scandal
to
Mr.
Browne
who
is
of
the
other
*NL*
persuasion

''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Kate
turned
to
Mr.
Browne
,
who
was
grinning
at
this
allusion
to
his
*NL*
religion
,
and
said
hastily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
do
n't
question
the
pope
's
being
right
.
I
'm
only
a
stupid
old
woman
*NL*
and
I
would
n't
presume
to
do
such
a
thing
.
But
there
's
such
a
thing
as
*NL*
common
everyday
politeness
and
gratitude
.
And
if
I
were
in
Julia
's
place
*NL*
I
'd
tell
that
Father
Healey
straight
up
to
his
face
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
besides
,
Aunt

,
''
said
Mary
Jane
,
``
we
really
are
all
hungry

*NL*
when
we
are
hungry
we
are
all
very
quarrelsome

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
we
are
thirsty
we
are
also
quarrelsome

''
added
Mr.
Browne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
we
had
better
go
to
supper
,
''
said
Mary
Jane
,
``
and
finish
the
*NL*
discussion
afterwards

''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
landing
outside
the
drawing-room
Gabriel
found
his
wife
and
Mary
*NL*
Jane
trying
to
persuade
Miss
Ivors
to
stay
for
supper
.
But
Miss
Ivors
,
*NL*
who
had
put
on
her
hat
and
was
buttoning
her
cloak
,
would
not
stay
.
*NL*
She
did
not
feel
in
the
least
hungry
and
she
had
already
overstayed
her
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
only
for
ten
minutes

Molly

said
Mrs.
Conroy

That

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mary

,
``
after

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
could

said
Miss
Ivors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid

said
Mary

*NL*
hopelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ever
so
much

I
assure
you

said
Miss

,
``

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
you
get
home
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Conroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
it
's
only
two
steps
up
the
quay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
hesitated
a
moment
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
allow
me
,
Miss
Ivors
,
I
'll
see
you
home
if

obliged
to
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Miss
Ivors
broke
away
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
hear
of

''
she
cried
.
``
For

go
in

your

do

I

well
able

take
care
of
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
the
comical
girl

Molly

''
said
Mrs.
Conroy
frankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beannacht
libh
,
''
cried
Miss
Ivors
,
with
a
laugh
,
as
she
ran
down
the
*NL*
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Jane
gazed
after
her
,
a
moody
puzzled
expression
on
her
face
,
*NL*
while
Mrs.
Conroy
leaned
over
the
banisters
to
listen
for
the
hall-door
.
*NL*
Gabriel
asked
himself
was
he
the
cause
of
her
abrupt
departure
.
But
she
*NL*
did
not
seem
to
be
in
ill
humour
:
she
had
gone
away
laughing
.
He
stared
*NL*
blankly
down
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
Aunt
Kate
came
toddling
out
of
the
supper-room
,
almost
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Gabriel
?
''
she
cried
.
``
Where
on
earth
is
Gabriel
?
There
's
*NL*
everyone
waiting
in
there
,
stage
to
let
,
and
nobody
to
carve
the
goose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
,
Aunt
Kate
!
''
cried
Gabriel
,
with
sudden
animation
,
``
ready
to
*NL*
carve
a
flock
of
geese
,
if
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fat
brown
goose
lay
at
one
end
of
the
table
and
at
the
other
end
,
on
*NL*
a
bed
of
creased
paper
strewn
with
sprigs
of
parsley
,
lay
a
great
ham
,
*NL*
stripped
of
its
outer
skin
and
peppered
over
with
crust
crumbs
,
a
neat
*NL*
paper
frill
round
its
shin
and
beside
this
was
a
round
of
spiced
beef
.
*NL*
Between
these
rival
ends
ran
parallel
lines
of
side-dishes
:
two
little
*NL*
minsters
of
jelly
,
red
and
yellow
;
a
shallow
dish
full
of
blocks
*NL*
of
blancmange
and
red
jam
,
a
large
green
leaf-shaped
dish
with
a
*NL*
stalk-shaped
handle
,
on
which
lay
bunches
of
purple
raisins
and
peeled
*NL*
almonds
,
a
companion
dish
on
which
lay
a
solid
rectangle
of
Smyrna
*NL*
figs
,
a
dish
of
custard
topped
with
grated
nutmeg
,
a
small
bowl
full
of
*NL*
chocolates
and
sweets
wrapped
in
gold
and
silver
papers
and
a
glass
vase
*NL*
in
which
stood
some
tall
celery
stalks
.
In
the
centre
of
the
table
there
*NL*
stood
,
as
sentries
to
a
fruit-stand
which
upheld
a
pyramid
of
oranges
*NL*
and
American
apples
,
two
squat
old-fashioned
decanters
of
cut
glass
,
one
*NL*
containing
port
and
the
other
dark
sherry
.
On
the
closed
square
piano
*NL*
a
pudding
in
a
huge
yellow
dish
lay
in
waiting
and
behind
it
were
three
*NL*
squads
of
bottles
of
stout
and
ale
and
minerals
,
drawn
up
according
to
*NL*
the
colours
of
their
uniforms
,
the
first
two
black
,
with
brown
and
*NL*
red
labels
,
the
third
and
smallest
squad
white
,
with
transverse
green
*NL*
sashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
took
his
seat
boldly
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
,
having
looked
*NL*
to
the
edge
of
the
carver
,
plunged
his
fork
firmly
into
the
goose
.
He
*NL*
felt
quite
at
ease
now
for
he
was
an
expert
carver
and
liked
nothing
*NL*
better
than
to
find
himself
at
the
head
of
a
well-laden
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Furlong
,
what
shall
I
send
you
?
''
he
asked
.
``
A
wing
or
a
slice
of
*NL*
the
breast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
small
slice
of
the
breast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Higgins
,
what
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
anything
at
all
,
Mr.
Conroy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Gabriel
and
Miss
Daly
exchanged
plates
of
goose
and
plates
of
ham
*NL*
and
spiced
beef
Lily
went
from
guest
to
guest
with
a
dish
of
hot
floury
*NL*
potatoes
wrapped
in
a
white
napkin
.
This
was
Mary
Jane
's
idea
and
she
*NL*
had
also
suggested
apple
sauce
for
the
goose
but
Aunt
Kate
had
said
that
*NL*
plain
roast
goose
without
any
apple
sauce
had
always
been
good
enough
*NL*
for
her
and
she
hoped
she
might
never
eat
worse
.
Mary
Jane
waited
on
*NL*
her
pupils
and
saw
that
they
got
the
best
slices
and
Aunt
Kate
and
Aunt
*NL*
Julia
opened
and
carried
across
from
the
piano
bottles
of
stout
and
ale
*NL*
for
the
gentlemen
and
bottles
of
minerals
for
the
ladies
.
There
was
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
confusion
and
laughter
and
noise
,
the
noise
of
orders
*NL*
and
counter-orders
,
of
knives
and
forks
,
of
corks
and
glass-stoppers
.
*NL*
Gabriel
began
to
carve
second
helpings
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
the
*NL*
first
round
without
serving
himself
.
Everyone
protested
loudly
so
that
*NL*
he
compromised
by
taking
a
long
draught
of
stout
for
he
had
found
the
*NL*
carving
hot
work
.
Mary
Jane
settled
down
quietly
to
her
supper
but
Aunt
*NL*
Kate
and
Aunt
Julia
were
still
toddling
round
the
table
,
walking
on
*NL*
each
other
's
heels
,
getting
in
each
other
's
way
and
giving
each
other
*NL*
unheeded
orders
.
Mr.
Browne
begged
of
them
to
sit
down
and
eat
their
*NL*
suppers
and
so
did
Gabriel
but
they
said
there
was
time
enough
,
so
that
,
*NL*
at
last
,
Freddy
Malins
stood
up
and
,
capturing
Aunt
Kate
,
plumped
her
*NL*
down
on
her
chair
amid
general
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
everyone
had
been
well
served
Gabriel
said
,
smiling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
if
anyone
wants
a
little
more
of
what
vulgar
people
call
stuffing
*NL*
let
him
or
her
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
chorus
of
voices
invited
him
to
begin
his
own
supper
and
Lily
came
*NL*
forward
with
three
potatoes
which
she
had
reserved
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Gabriel
amiably
,
as
he
took
another
preparatory
*NL*
draught
,
``
kindly
forget
my
existence
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
,
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
to
his
supper
and
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
with
which
the
*NL*
table
covered
Lily
's
removal
of
the
plates
.
The
subject
of
talk
was
the
*NL*
opera
company
which
was
then
at
the
Theatre
Royal
.
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
,
*NL*
the
tenor
,
a
dark-complexioned
young
man
with
a
smart
moustache
,
praised
*NL*
very
highly
the
leading
contralto
of
the
company
but
Miss
Furlong
*NL*
thought
she
had
a
rather
vulgar
style
of
production
.
Freddy
Malins
said
*NL*
there
was
a
Negro
chieftain
singing
in
the
second
part
of
the
Gaiety
*NL*
pantomime
who
had
one
of
the
finest
tenor
voices
he
had
ever
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
him
?
''
he
asked
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
across
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
Freddy
Malins
explained
,
``
now
I
'd
be
curious
to
hear
your
*NL*
opinion
of
him
.
I
think
he
has
a
grand
voice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
takes
Teddy
to
find
out
the
really
good
things
,
''
said
Mr.
Browne
*NL*
familiarly
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
could
n't
he
have
a
voice
too
?
''
asked
Freddy
Malins
sharply
.
``
Is
*NL*
it
because
he
's
only
a
black
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
answered
this
question
and
Mary
Jane
led
the
table
back
to
the
*NL*
legitimate
opera
.
One
of
her
pupils
had
given
her
a
pass
for
Mignon
.
*NL*
Of
course
it
was
very
fine
,
she
said
,
but
it
made
her
think
of
poor
*NL*
Georgina
Burns
.
Mr.
Browne
could
go
back
farther
still
,
to
the
old
*NL*
Italian
companies
that
used
to
come
to
Dublin
--
Tietjens
,
Ilma
de
Murzka
,
*NL*
Campanini
,
the
great
Trebelli
,
Giuglini
,
Ravelli
,
Aramburo
.
Those
were
*NL*
the
days
,
he
said
,
when
there
was
something
like
singing
to
be
heard
in
*NL*
Dublin
.
He
told
too
of
how
the
top
gallery
of
the
old
Royal
used
to
be
*NL*
packed
night
after
night
,
of
how
one
night
an
Italian
tenor
had
sung
*NL*
five
encores
to
Let
me
like
a
Soldier
fall
,
introducing
a
high
C
every
*NL*
time
,
and
of
how
the
gallery
boys
would
sometimes
in
their
enthusiasm
*NL*
unyoke
the
horses
from
the
carriage
of
some
great
prima
donna
and
pull
*NL*
her
themselves
through
the
streets
to
her
hotel
.
Why
did
they
never
play
*NL*
the
grand
old
operas
now
,
he
asked
,
Dinorah
,
Lucrezia
Borgia
?
Because
*NL*
they
could
not
get
the
voices
to
sing
them
:
that
was
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
,
``
I
presume
there
are
as
good
*NL*
singers
today
as
there
were
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
they
?
''
asked
Mr.
Browne
defiantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
London
,
Paris
,
Milan
,
''
said
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
warmly
.
``
I
suppose
*NL*
Caruso
,
for
example
,
is
quite
as
good
,
if
not
better
than
any
of
the
men
*NL*
you
have
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
so
,
''
said
Mr.
Browne
.
``
But
I
may
tell
you
I
doubt
it
strongly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
'd
give
anything
to
hear
Caruso
sing
,
''
said
Mary
Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
,
who
had
been
picking
a
bone
,
``
there
was
only
*NL*
one
tenor
.
To
please
me
,
I
mean
.
But
I
suppose
none
of
you
ever
heard
of
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
he
,
Miss
Morkan
?
''
asked
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
name
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
,
``
was
Parkinson
.
I
heard
him
when
he
was
in
*NL*
his
prime
and
I
think
he
had
then
the
purest
tenor
voice
that
was
ever
*NL*
put
into
a
man
's
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
,
''
said
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
.
``
I
never
even
heard
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
Miss
Morkan
is
right
,
''
said
Mr.
Browne
.
``
I
remember
hearing
*NL*
of
old
Parkinson
but
he
's
too
far
back
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
beautiful
,
pure
,
sweet
,
mellow
English
tenor
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
with
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
having
finished
,
the
huge
pudding
was
transferred
to
the
table
.
*NL*
The
clatter
of
forks
and
spoons
began
again
.
Gabriel
's
wife
served
out
*NL*
spoonfuls
of
the
pudding
and
passed
the
plates
down
the
table
.
Midway
*NL*
down
they
were
held
up
by
Mary
Jane
,
who
replenished
them
with
raspberry
*NL*
or
orange
jelly
or
with
blancmange
and
jam
.
The
pudding
was
of
Aunt
*NL*
Julia
's
making
and
she
received
praises
for
it
from
all
quarters
.
She
*NL*
herself
said
that
it
was
not
quite
brown
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
,
Miss
Morkan
,
''
said
Mr.
Browne
,
``
that
I
'm
brown
enough
for
*NL*
you
because
,
you
know
,
I
'm
all
brown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
gentlemen
,
except
Gabriel
,
ate
some
of
the
pudding
out
of
*NL*
compliment
to
Aunt
Julia
.
As
Gabriel
never
ate
sweets
the
celery
had
*NL*
been
left
for
him
.
Freddy
Malins
also
took
a
stalk
of
celery
and
ate
it
*NL*
with
his
pudding
.
He
had
been
told
that
celery
was
a
capital
thing
for
*NL*
the
blood
and
he
was
just
then
under
doctor
's
care
.
Mrs.
Malins
,
who
had
*NL*
been
silent
all
through
the
supper
,
said
that
her
son
was
going
down
to
*NL*
Mount
Melleray
in
a
week
or
so
.
The
table
then
spoke
of
Mount
Melleray
,
*NL*
how
bracing
the
air
was
down
there
,
how
hospitable
the
monks
were
and
*NL*
how
they
never
asked
for
a
penny-piece
from
their
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
mean
to
say
,
''
asked
Mr.
Browne
incredulously
,
``
that
a
chap
*NL*
can
go
down
there
and
put
up
there
as
if
it
were
a
hotel
and
live
on
the
*NL*
fat
of
the
land
and
then
come
away
without
paying
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
most
people
give
some
donation
to
the
monastery
when
they
leave
.
''
*NL*
said
Mary
Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
we
had
an
institution
like
that
in
our
Church
,
''
said
Mr.
Browne
*NL*
candidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
astonished
to
hear
that
the
monks
never
spoke
,
got
up
at
two
in
*NL*
the
morning
and
slept
in
their
coffins
.
He
asked
what
they
did
it
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
rule
of
the
order
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
why
?
''
asked
Mr.
Browne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Kate
repeated
that
it
was
the
rule
,
that
was
all
.
Mr.
Browne
still
*NL*
seemed
not
to
understand
.
Freddy
Malins
explained
to
him
,
as
best
he
*NL*
could
,
that
the
monks
were
trying
to
make
up
for
the
sins
committed
by
*NL*
all
the
sinners
in
the
outside
world
.
The
explanation
was
not
very
clear
*NL*
for
Mr.
Browne
grinned
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
that
idea
very
much
but
would
n't
a
comfortable
spring
bed
do
*NL*
them
as
well
as
a
coffin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
coffin
,
''
said
Mary
Jane
,
``
is
to
remind
them
of
their
last
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
subject
had
grown
lugubrious
it
was
buried
in
a
silence
of
the
*NL*
table
during
which
Mrs.
Malins
could
be
heard
saying
to
her
neighbour
in
*NL*
an
indistinct
undertone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
very
good
men
,
the
monks
,
very
pious
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
raisins
and
almonds
and
figs
and
apples
and
oranges
and
chocolates
*NL*
and
sweets
were
now
passed
about
the
table
and
Aunt
Julia
invited
all
*NL*
the
guests
to
have
either
port
or
sherry
.
At
first
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
*NL*
refused
to
take
either
but
one
of
his
neighbours
nudged
him
and
*NL*
whispered
something
to
him
upon
which
he
allowed
his
glass
to
be
filled
.
*NL*
Gradually
as
the
last
glasses
were
being
filled
the
conversation
*NL*
ceased
.
A
pause
followed
,
broken
only
by
the
noise
of
the
wine
and
by
*NL*
unsettlings
of
chairs
.
The
Misses
Morkan
,
all
three
,
looked
down
at
*NL*
the
tablecloth
.
Someone
coughed
once
or
twice
and
then
a
few
gentlemen
*NL*
patted
the
table
gently
as
a
signal
for
silence
.
The
silence
came
and
*NL*
Gabriel
pushed
back
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
patting
at
once
grew
louder
in
encouragement
and
then
ceased
*NL*
altogether
.
Gabriel
leaned
his
ten
trembling
fingers
on
the
tablecloth
*NL*
and
smiled
nervously
at
the
company
.
Meeting
a
row
of
upturned
faces
he
*NL*
raised
his
eyes
to
the
chandelier
.
The
piano
was
playing
a
waltz
tune
*NL*
and
he
could
hear
the
skirts
sweeping
against
the
drawing-room
door
.
*NL*
People
,
perhaps
,
were
standing
in
the
snow
on
the
quay
outside
,
gazing
*NL*
up
at
the
lighted
windows
and
listening
to
the
waltz
music
.
The
air
was
*NL*
pure
there
.
In
the
distance
lay
the
park
where
the
trees
were
weighted
*NL*
with
snow
.
The
Wellington
Monument
wore
a
gleaming
cap
of
snow
that
*NL*
flashed
westward
over
the
white
field
of
Fifteen
Acres
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
fallen
to
my
lot
this
evening
,
as
in
years
past
,
to
perform
a
*NL*
very
pleasing
task
but
a
task
for
which
I
am
afraid
my
poor
powers
as
a
*NL*
speaker
are
all
too
inadequate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
said
Mr.
Browne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
however
that
may
be
,
I
can
only
ask
you
tonight
to
take
the
will
*NL*
for
the
deed
and
to
lend
me
your
attention
for
a
few
moments
while
*NL*
I
endeavour
to
express
to
you
in
words
what
my
feelings
are
on
this
*NL*
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
,
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
we
have
gathered
*NL*
together
under
this
hospitable
roof
,
around
this
hospitable
board
.
It
is
*NL*
not
the
first
time
that
we
have
been
the
recipients
--
or
perhaps
,
I
had
*NL*
better
say
,
the
victims
--
of
the
hospitality
of
certain
good
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
circle
in
the
air
with
his
arm
and
paused
.
Everyone
laughed
or
*NL*
smiled
at
Aunt
Kate
and
Aunt
Julia
and
Mary
Jane
who
all
turned
crimson
*NL*
with
pleasure
.
Gabriel
went
on
more
boldly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
more
strongly
with
every
recurring
year
that
our
country
has
*NL*
no
tradition
which
does
it
so
much
honour
and
which
it
should
guard
so
*NL*
jealously
as
that
of
its
hospitality
.
It
is
a
tradition
that
is
unique
*NL*
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
-LRB-
and
I
have
visited
not
a
few
places
*NL*
abroad
-RRB-
among
the
modern
nations
.
Some
would
say
,
perhaps
,
that
with
us
*NL*
it
is
rather
a
failing
than
anything
to
be
boasted
of
.
But
granted
even
*NL*
that
,
it
is
,
to
my
mind
,
a
princely
failing
,
and
one
that
I
trust
will
*NL*
long
be
cultivated
among
us
.
Of
one
thing
,
at
least
,
I
am
sure
.
As
long
*NL*
as
this
one
roof
shelters
the
good
ladies
aforesaid
--
and
I
wish
from
my
*NL*
heart
it
may
do
so
for
many
and
many
a
long
year
to
come
--
the
tradition
*NL*
of
genuine
warm-hearted
courteous
Irish
hospitality
,
which
our
*NL*
forefathers
have
handed
down
to
us
and
which
we
in
turn
must
hand
down
*NL*
to
our
descendants
,
is
still
alive
among
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
hearty
murmur
of
assent
ran
round
the
table
.
It
shot
through
*NL*
Gabriel
's
mind
that
Miss
Ivors
was
not
there
and
that
she
had
gone
away
*NL*
discourteously
:
and
he
said
with
confidence
in
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
new
generation
is
growing
up
in
our
midst
,
a
generation
actuated
by
*NL*
new
ideas
and
new
principles
.
It
is
serious
and
enthusiastic
for
*NL*
these
new
ideas
and
its
enthusiasm
,
even
when
it
is
misdirected
,
is
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
in
the
main
sincere
.
But
we
are
living
in
a
sceptical
and
,
if
*NL*
I
may
use
the
phrase
,
a
thought-tormented
age
:
and
sometimes
I
fear
that
*NL*
this
new
generation
,
educated
or
hypereducated
as
it
is
,
will
lack
those
*NL*
qualities
of
humanity
,
of
hospitality
,
of
kindly
humour
which
belonged
*NL*
to
an
older
day
.
Listening
tonight
to
the
names
of
all
those
great
*NL*
singers
of
the
past
it
seemed
to
me
,
I
must
confess
,
that
we
were
living
*NL*
in
a
less
spacious
age
.
Those
days
might
,
without
exaggeration
,
be
*NL*
called
spacious
days
:
and
if
they
are
gone
beyond
recall
let
us
hope
,
at
*NL*
least
,
that
in
gatherings
such
as
this
we
shall
still
speak
of
them
with
*NL*
pride
and
affection
,
still
cherish
in
our
hearts
the
memory
of
those
*NL*
dead
and
gone
great
ones
whose
fame
the
world
will
not
willingly
let
*NL*
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
,
hear
!
''
said
Mr.
Browne
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
yet
,
''
continued
Gabriel
,
his
voice
falling
into
a
softer
*NL*
inflection
,
``
there
are
always
in
gatherings
such
as
this
sadder
thoughts
*NL*
that
will
recur
to
our
minds
:
thoughts
of
the
past
,
of
youth
,
of
*NL*
changes
,
of
absent
faces
that
we
miss
here
tonight
.
Our
path
through
*NL*
life
is
strewn
with
many
such
sad
memories
:
and
were
we
to
brood
upon
*NL*
them
always
we
could
not
find
the
heart
to
go
on
bravely
with
our
work
*NL*
among
the
living
.
We
have
all
of
us
living
duties
and
living
affections
*NL*
which
claim
,
and
rightly
claim
,
our
strenuous
endeavours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
,
I
will
not
linger
on
the
past
.
I
will
not
let
any
gloomy
*NL*
moralising
intrude
upon
us
here
tonight
.
Here
we
are
gathered
together
*NL*
for
a
brief
moment
from
the
bustle
and
rush
of
our
everyday
routine
.
*NL*
We
are
met
here
as
friends
,
in
the
spirit
of
good-fellowship
,
as
*NL*
colleagues
,
also
to
a
certain
extent
,
in
the
true
spirit
of
camaraderie
,
*NL*
and
as
the
guests
of
--
what
shall
I
call
them
?
--
the
Three
Graces
of
the
*NL*
Dublin
musical
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
table
burst
into
applause
and
laughter
at
this
allusion
.
Aunt
Julia
*NL*
vainly
asked
each
of
her
neighbours
in
turn
to
tell
her
what
Gabriel
had
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
we
are
the
Three
Graces

said
Mary
Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Julia
did
not
understand
but
she
looked
up
,
smiling
,
at
Gabriel
,
*NL*
who
continued
in
the
same
vein
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
and
Gentlemen

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not

tonight
the

another

to
choose
between
them

The
task
*NL*
would
be
an
invidious
one
and
one
beyond
my
poor
powers

For
when
I
view
*NL*
them
in
turn
,
whether
it
be
our
chief
hostess
herself
,
whose
good
heart
,
*NL*
whose
too
good
heart
,
has
become
a
byword
with
all
who
know
her

or
her
*NL*
sister
,
who
seems
to
be
gifted
with
perennial
youth
and
whose
singing
*NL*
must
have
been
a
surprise
and
a
revelation
to
us
all
tonight
,
or
,
last
*NL*

not

I
consider

*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
glanced
down
at
his
aunts
and
,
seeing
the
large
smile
on
Aunt
*NL*
Julia
's
face
and
the
tears
which
had
risen
to
Aunt
Kate
's
eyes
,
hastened
*NL*
to
his
close
.
He
raised
his
glass
of
port
gallantly
,
while
every
member
*NL*
of
the
company
fingered
a
glass
expectantly
,
and
said
loudly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
toast
them
all
three
together

Let
us
drink

their
health

happiness

prosperity

may
they
long
continue
*NL*
to
hold
the
proud
and
self-won
position
which
they
hold
in
their
*NL*
profession
and
the
position
of
honour

affection
which
they
hold
in

our
hearts

''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
guests
stood
up
,
glass
in
hand
,
and
turning
towards
the
three
*NL*
seated
ladies
,
sang
in
unison
,
with
Mr.
Browne
as
leader
:

For

For
they

For

*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Kate
was
making
frank
use
of
her
handkerchief
and
even
Aunt
Julia
*NL*
seemed
moved
.
Freddy
Malins
beat
time
with
his
pudding-fork
and
the
*NL*
singers
turned
towards
one
another
,
as
if
in
melodious
conference
,
while
*NL*
they
sang
with
emphasis
:

*NL*
Unless

a

Then
,
turning
once
more
towards

they
sang

The
acclamation
which
followed
was
taken
up
beyond
the
door
of
the
*NL*
supper-room
by
many
of
the
other
guests

renewed
time
after
time

The
piercing
morning
air
came
into
the
hall
where
they
were
standing
so
*NL*
that
Aunt
Kate
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Close
the
door
,
somebody
.
Mrs.
Malins
will
get
her
death
of
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Browne
is
out
there
,
Aunt
Kate
,
''
said
Mary
Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Browne
is
everywhere
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
,
lowering
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Jane
laughed
at
her
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
she
said
archly
,
``
he
is
very
attentive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
laid
on
here
like
the
gas
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
in
the
same
*NL*
tone
,
``
all
during
the
Christmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
herself
this
time
good-humouredly
and
then
added
quickly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
him
to
come
in
,
Mary
Jane
,
and
close
the
door
.
I
hope
to
*NL*
goodness
he
did
n't
hear
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
hall-door
was
opened
and
Mr.
Browne
came
in
from
the
*NL*
doorstep
,
laughing
as
if
his
heart
would
break
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
long
*NL*
green
overcoat
with
mock
astrakhan
cuffs
and
collar
and
wore
on
his
head
*NL*
an
oval
fur
cap
.
He
pointed
down
the
snow-covered
quay
from
where
the
*NL*
sound
of
shrill
prolonged
whistling
was
borne
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Teddy
will
have
all
the
cabs
in
Dublin
out
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
advanced
from
the
little
pantry
behind
the
office
,
struggling
*NL*
into
his
overcoat
and
,
looking
round
the
hall
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gretta
not
down
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
getting
on
her
things
,
Gabriel
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
playing
up
there
?
''
asked
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
.
They
're
all
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
Aunt
Kate
,
''
said
Mary
Jane
.
``
Bartell
D'Arcy
and
Miss
O'Callaghan
*NL*
are
n't
gone
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Someone
is
fooling
at
the
piano
anyhow
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Jane
glanced
at
Gabriel
and
Mr.
Browne
and
said
with
a
shiver
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
me
feel
cold
to
look
at
you
two
gentlemen
muffled
up
like
*NL*
that
.
I
would
n't
like
to
face
your
journey
home
at
this
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
nothing
better
this
minute
,
''
said
Mr.
Browne
stoutly
,
``
than
a
*NL*
rattling
fine
walk
in
the
country
or
a
fast
drive
with
a
good
spanking
*NL*
goer
between
the
shafts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
used
to
have
a
very
good
horse
and
trap
at
home
,
''
said
Aunt
Julia
*NL*
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
never-to-be-forgotten
Johnny
,
''
said
Mary
Jane
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Kate
and
Gabriel
laughed
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
was
wonderful
about
Johnny
?
''
asked
Mr.
Browne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
late
lamented
Patrick
Morkan
,
our
grandfather
,
that
is
,
''
explained
*NL*
Gabriel
,
``
commonly
known
in
his
later
years
as
the
old
gentleman
,
was
a
*NL*
glue-boiler
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
now
,
Gabriel
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
,
laughing
,
``
he
had
a
starch
mill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
glue
or
starch
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
``
the
old
gentleman
had
a
horse
by
*NL*
the
name
of
Johnny
.
And
Johnny
used
to
work
in
the
old
gentleman
's
mill
,
*NL*
walking
round
and
round
in
order
to
drive
the
mill
.
That
was
all
very
*NL*
well
;
but
now
comes
the
tragic
part
about
Johnny
.
One
fine
day
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
thought
he
'd
like
to
drive
out
with
the
quality
to
a
military
*NL*
review
in
the
park
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord
have
mercy
on
his
soul

''
said
Aunt
Kate
compassionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
``
So
the
old
gentleman
,
as
I
said
,
harnessed
Johnny
*NL*
and
put
on
his
very
best
tall
hat
and
his
very
best
stock
collar
and
*NL*
drove
out
in
grand
style
from
his
ancestral
mansion
somewhere
near
Back
*NL*
Lane
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
laughed
,
even
Mrs.
Malins
,
at
Gabriel
's
manner
and
Aunt
Kate
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
now
,
Gabriel
,
he
did
n't
live
in
Back
Lane

really

Only
the
mill
was
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
from
the
mansion
of
his
forefathers
,
''
continued
Gabriel
,
``
he
drove
*NL*
with
Johnny
.
And
everything
went
on
beautifully
until
Johnny
came
in
*NL*
sight
of
King
Billy
's
statue
:
and
whether
he
fell
in
love
with
the
horse
*NL*
King
Billy
sits
on
or
whether
he
thought
he
was
back
again
in
the
mill
,
*NL*
anyhow
he
began
to
walk
round
the
statue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
paced
in
a
circle
round
the
hall
in
his
goloshes
amid
the
*NL*
laughter
of
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Round
and
round
he
went
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
``
and
the
old
gentleman
,
who
was
*NL*
a
very
pompous
old
gentleman
,
was
highly
indignant
.

Go
on
,
sir

What
*NL*
do
you
mean
,
sir

Johnny
!
Johnny
!
Most
extraordinary
conduct

Ca
n't
*NL*
understand
the
horse

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
peal
of
laughter
which
followed
Gabriel
's
imitation
of
the
incident
*NL*
was
interrupted
by
a
resounding
knock
at
the
hall
door
.
Mary
Jane
ran
to
*NL*
open
it
and
let
in
Freddy
Malins
.
Freddy
Malins
,
with
his
hat
well
back
*NL*
on
his
head
and
his
shoulders
humped
with
cold
,
was
puffing
and
steaming
*NL*
after
his
exertions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
only
get
one
cab
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
we
'll
find
another
along
the
quay
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
.
``
Better
not
keep
Mrs.
Malins
standing
in
the
*NL*
draught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Malins
was
helped
down
the
front
steps
by
her
son
and
Mr.
Browne
*NL*
and
,
after
many
manoeuvres
,
hoisted
into
the
cab
.
Freddy
Malins
*NL*
clambered
in
after
her
and
spent
a
long
time
settling
her
on
the
seat
,
*NL*
Mr.
Browne
helping
him
with
advice
.
At
last
she
was
settled
comfortably
*NL*
and
Freddy
Malins
invited
Mr.
Browne
into
the
cab
.
There
was
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
confused
talk
,
and
then
Mr.
Browne
got
into
the
cab
.
The
cabman
*NL*
settled
his
rug
over
his
knees
,
and
bent
down
for
the
address
.
The
*NL*
confusion
grew
greater
and
the
cabman
was
directed
differently
by
Freddy
*NL*
Malins
and
Mr.
Browne
,
each
of
whom
had
his
head
out
through
a
window
of
*NL*
the
cab
.
The
difficulty
was
to
know
where
to
drop
Mr.
Browne
along
the
*NL*
route
,
and
Aunt
Kate
,
Aunt
Julia
and
Mary
Jane
helped
the
discussion
*NL*
from
the
doorstep
with
cross-directions
and
contradictions
and
abundance
*NL*
of
laughter
.
As
for
Freddy
Malins
he
was
speechless
with
laughter
.
*NL*
He
popped
his
head
in
and
out
of
the
window
every
moment
to
the
*NL*
great
danger
of
his
hat
,
and
told
his
mother
how
the
discussion
was
*NL*
progressing
,
till
at
last
Mr.
Browne
shouted
to
the
bewildered
cabman
*NL*
above
the
din
of
everybody
's
laughter
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
Trinity
College
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
the
cabman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
drive
bang
up
against
Trinity
College
gates
,
''
said
Mr.
Browne
,
*NL*
``
and
then
we
'll
tell
you
where
to
go
.
You
understand
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
the
cabman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
like
a
bird
for
Trinity
College
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
,
sir
,
''
said
the
cabman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
was
whipped
up
and
the
cab
rattled
off
along
the
quay
amid
a
*NL*
chorus
of
laughter
and
adieus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
had
not
gone
to
the
door
with
the
others
.
He
was
in
a
dark
part
*NL*
of
the
hall
gazing
up
the
staircase
.
A
woman
was
standing
near
the
top
*NL*
of
the
first
flight
,
in
the
shadow
also
.
He
could
not
see
her
face
but
*NL*
he
could
see
the
terra-cotta
and
salmon-pink
panels
of
her
skirt
which
*NL*
the
shadow
made
appear
black
and
white
.
It
was
his
wife
.
She
was
leaning
*NL*
on
the
banisters
,
listening
to
something
.
Gabriel
was
surprised
at
her
*NL*
stillness
and
strained
his
ear
to
listen
also
.
But
he
could
hear
little
*NL*
save
the
noise
of
laughter
and
dispute
on
the
front
steps
,
a
few
chords
*NL*
struck
on
the
piano
and
a
few
notes
of
a
man
's
voice
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
still
in
the
gloom
of
the
hall
,
trying
to
catch
the
air
that
*NL*
the
voice
was
singing
and
gazing
up
at
his
wife
.
There
was
grace
and
*NL*
mystery
in
her
attitude
as
if
she
were
a
symbol
of
something
.
He
asked
*NL*
himself
what
is
a
woman
standing
on
the
stairs
in
the
shadow
,
listening
*NL*
to
distant
music
,
a
symbol
of
.
If
he
were
a
painter
he
would
paint
her
*NL*
in
that
attitude
.
Her
blue
felt
hat
would
show
off
the
bronze
of
her
*NL*
hair
against
the
darkness
and
the
dark
panels
of
her
skirt
would
show
*NL*
off
the
light
ones
.
Distant
Music
he
would
call
the
picture
if
he
were
a
*NL*
painter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hall-door
was
closed
;
and
Aunt
Kate
,
Aunt
Julia
and
Mary
Jane
came
*NL*
down
the
hall
,
still
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
is
n't
Freddy
terrible
?
''
said
Mary
Jane
.
``
He
's
really
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
said
nothing
but
pointed
up
the
stairs
towards
where
his
wife
*NL*
was
standing
.
Now
that
the
hall-door
was
closed
the
voice
and
the
piano
*NL*
could
be
heard
more
clearly
.
Gabriel
held
up
his
hand
for
them
to
be
*NL*
silent
.
The
song
seemed
to
be
in
the
old
Irish
tonality
and
the
singer
*NL*
seemed
uncertain
both
of
his
words
and
of
his
voice
.
The
voice
,
*NL*
made
plaintive
by
distance
and
by
the
singer
's
hoarseness
,
faintly
*NL*
illuminated
the
cadence
of
the
air
with
words
expressing
grief
:
*NL*
*NL*
O
,
the
rain
falls
on
my
heavy
locks
*NL*
And
the
dew
wets
my
skin
,
*NL*
My
babe
lies
cold
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
''
exclaimed
Mary
Jane
.
``
It
's
Bartell
D'Arcy
singing
and
he
would
n't
*NL*
sing
all
the
night
.
O
,
I
'll
get
him
to
sing
a
song
before
he
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
do
,
Mary
Jane
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Jane
brushed
past
the
others
and
ran
to
the
staircase
,
but
before
*NL*
she
reached
it
the
singing
stopped
and
the
piano
was
closed
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
what
a
pity
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Is
he
coming
down
,
Gretta
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
heard
his
wife
answer
yes
and
saw
her
come
down
towards
them
.
A
*NL*
few
steps
behind
her
were
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
and
Miss
O'Callaghan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Mr.
D'Arcy
,
''
cried
Mary
Jane
,
``
it
's
downright
mean
of
you
to
break
*NL*
off
like
that
when
we
were
all
in
raptures
listening
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
at
him
all
the
evening
,
''
said
Miss
O'Callaghan
,
``
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Conroy
,
too
,
and
he
told
us
he
had
a
dreadful
cold
and
could
n't
sing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Mr.
D'Arcy
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
,
``
now
that
was
a
great
fib
to
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
see
that
I
'm
as
hoarse
as
a
crow
?
''
said
Mr.
D'Arcy
roughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
into
the
pantry
hastily
and
put
on
his
overcoat
.
The
others
,
*NL*
taken
aback
by
his
rude
speech
,
could
find
nothing
to
say
.
Aunt
Kate
*NL*
wrinkled
her
brows
and
made
signs
to
the
others
to
drop
the
subject
.
Mr.
*NL*
D'Arcy
stood
swathing
his
neck
carefully
and
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
weather
,
''
said
Aunt
Julia
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
everybody
has
colds
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
readily
,
``
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
,
''
said
Mary
Jane
,
``
we
have
n't
had
snow
like
it
for
thirty
*NL*
years
;
and
I
read
this
morning
in
the
newspapers
that
the
snow
is
*NL*
general
all
over
Ireland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
the
look
of
snow
,
''
said
Aunt
Julia
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
,
''
said
Miss
O'Callaghan
.
``
I
think
Christmas
is
never
really
*NL*
Christmas
unless
we
have
the
snow
on
the
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
poor
Mr.
D'Arcy
does
n't
like
the
snow
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
D'Arcy
came
from
the
pantry
,
fully
swathed
and
buttoned
,
and
in
*NL*
a
repentant
tone
told
them
the
history
of
his
cold
.
Everyone
gave
him
*NL*
advice
and
said
it
was
a
great
pity
and
urged
him
to
be
very
careful
of
*NL*
his
throat
in
the
night
air
.
Gabriel
watched
his
wife
,
who
did
not
join
*NL*
in
the
conversation
.
She
was
standing
right
under
the
dusty
fanlight
and
*NL*
the
flame
of
the
gas
lit
up
the
rich
bronze
of
her
hair
,
which
he
had
*NL*
seen
her
drying
at
the
fire
a
few
days
before
.
She
was
in
the
same
*NL*
attitude
and
seemed
unaware
of
the
talk
about
her
.
At
last
she
turned
*NL*
towards
them
and
Gabriel
saw
that
there
was
colour
on
her
cheeks
and
*NL*
that
her
eyes
were
shining
.
A
sudden
tide
of
joy
went
leaping
out
of
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
D'Arcy
,
''
she
said
,
``
what
is
the
name
of
that
song
you
were
*NL*
singing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
called
The
Lass
of
Aughrim
,
''
said
Mr.
D'Arcy
,
``
but
I
could
n't
*NL*
remember
it
properly
.
Why
?
Do
you
know
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lass
of
Aughrim
,
''
she
repeated
.
``
I
could
n't
think
of
the
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
very
nice
air
,
''
said
Mary
Jane
.
``
I
'm
sorry
you
were
not
in
voice
*NL*
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mary
Jane
,
''
said
Aunt
Kate
,
``
do
n't
annoy
Mr.
D'Arcy
.
I
wo
n't
have
*NL*
him
annoyed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
all
were
ready
to
start
she
shepherded
them
to
the
door
,
*NL*
where
good-night
was
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-night
,
Aunt
Kate
,
and
thanks
for
the
pleasant
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

Good-night

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

Aunt

ever
so
much

Goodnight

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
good-night
,
Gretta
,
I
did
n't
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

Mr.
D'Arcy
.
Good-night

Miss
O'Callaghan

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
Miss
Morkan

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

all

Safe
home

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

Good
night

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
was
still
dark
.
A
dull
,
yellow
light
brooded
over
the
*NL*
houses
and
the
river
;
and
the
sky
seemed
to
be
descending
.
It
was
slushy
*NL*
underfoot
;
and
only
streaks
and
patches
of
snow
lay
on
the
roofs
,
on
*NL*
the
parapets
of
the
quay
and
on
the
area
railings
.
The
lamps
were
still
*NL*
burning
redly
in
the
murky
air
and
,
across
the
river
,
the
palace
of
the
*NL*
Four
Courts
stood
out
menacingly
against
the
heavy
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
walking
on
before
him
with
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
,
her
shoes
in
a
*NL*
brown
parcel
tucked
under
one
arm
and
her
hands
holding
her
skirt
up
*NL*
from
the
slush
.
She
had
no
longer
any
grace
of
attitude
,
but
Gabriel
's
*NL*
eyes
were
still
bright
with
happiness
.
The
blood
went
bounding
along
his
*NL*
veins
;
and
the
thoughts
went
rioting
through
his
brain
,
proud
,
joyful
,
*NL*
tender
,
valorous
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
walking
on
before
him
so
lightly
and
so
erect
that
he
longed
to
*NL*
run
after
her
noiselessly
,
catch
her
by
the
shoulders
and
say
something
*NL*
foolish
and
affectionate
into
her
ear
.
She
seemed
to
him
so
frail
that
*NL*
he
longed
to
defend
her
against
something
and
then
to
be
alone
with
her
.
*NL*
Moments
of
their
secret
life
together
burst
like
stars
upon
his
memory
.
*NL*
A
heliotrope
envelope
was
lying
beside
his
breakfast-cup
and
he
was
*NL*
caressing
it
with
his
hand
.
Birds
were
twittering
in
the
ivy
and
the
*NL*
sunny
web
of
the
curtain
was
shimmering
along
the
floor
:
he
could
not
*NL*
eat
for
happiness
.
They
were
standing
on
the
crowded
platform
and
he
was
*NL*
placing
a
ticket
inside
the
warm
palm
of
her
glove
.
He
was
standing
*NL*
with
her
in
the
cold
,
looking
in
through
a
grated
window
at
a
man
making
*NL*
bottles
in
a
roaring
furnace
.
It
was
very
cold
.
Her
face
,
fragrant
in
*NL*
the
cold
air
,
was
quite
close
to
his
;
and
suddenly
he
called
out
to
the
*NL*
man
at
the
furnace
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
fire
hot
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
man
could
not
hear
with
the
noise
of
the
furnace
.
It
was
just
as
*NL*
well
.
He
might
have
answered
rudely
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
wave
of
yet
more
tender
joy
escaped
from
his
heart
and
went
coursing
*NL*
in
warm
flood
along
his
arteries
.
Like
the
tender
fire
of
stars
moments
*NL*
of
their
life
together
,
that
no
one
knew
of
or
would
ever
know
of
,
broke
*NL*
upon
and
illumined
his
memory
.
He
longed
to
recall
to
her
those
moments
,
*NL*
to
make
her
forget
the
years
of
their
dull
existence
together
and
*NL*
remember
only
their
moments
of
ecstasy
.
For
the
years
,
he
felt
,
had
not
*NL*
quenched
his
soul
or
hers
.
Their
children
,
his
writing
,
her
household
*NL*
cares
had
not
quenched
all
their
souls
'
tender
fire
.
In
one
letter
that
*NL*
he
had
written
to
her
then
he
had
said
:
``
Why
is
it
that
words
like
*NL*
these
seem
to
me
so
dull
and
cold
?
Is
it
because
there
is
no
word
tender
*NL*
enough
to
be
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Like
distant
music
these
words
that
he
had
written
years
before
were
*NL*
borne
towards
him
from
the
past
.
He
longed
to
be
alone
with
her
.
When
*NL*
the
others
had
gone
away
,
when
he
and
she
were
in
the
room
in
their
hotel
,
*NL*
then
they
would
be
alone
together
.
He
would
call
her
softly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gretta
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
would
not
hear
at
once
:
she
would
be
undressing
.
Then
*NL*
something
in
his
voice
would
strike
her
.
She
would
turn
and
look
at
*NL*
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
corner
of
Winetavern
Street
they
met
a
cab
.
He
was
glad
of
its
*NL*
rattling
noise
as
it
saved
him
from
conversation
.
She
was
looking
out
of
*NL*
the
window
and
seemed
tired
.
The
others
spoke
only
a
few
words
,
pointing
*NL*
out
some
building
or
street
.
The
horse
galloped
along
wearily
under
the
*NL*
murky
morning
sky
,
dragging
his
old
rattling
box
after
his
heels
,
*NL*
and
Gabriel
was
again
in
a
cab
with
her
,
galloping
to
catch
the
boat
,
*NL*
galloping
to
their
honeymoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
cab
drove
across
O'Connell
Bridge
Miss
O'Callaghan
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
you
never
cross
O'Connell
Bridge
without
seeing
a
white
*NL*
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
a
white
man
this
time
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
asked
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
pointed
to
the
statue
,
on
which
lay
patches
of
snow
.
Then
he
*NL*
nodded
familiarly
to
it
and
waved
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
Dan
,
''
he
said
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
cab
drew
up
before
the
hotel
,
Gabriel
jumped
out
and
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
Mr.
Bartell
D'Arcy
's
protest
,
paid
the
driver
.
He
gave
the
man
a
*NL*
shilling
over
his
fare
.
The
man
saluted
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
prosperous
New
Year
to
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
to
you
,
''
said
Gabriel
cordially
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
leaned
for
a
moment
on
his
arm
in
getting
out
of
the
cab
and
while
*NL*
standing
at
the
curbstone
,
bidding
the
others
good-night
.
She
leaned
*NL*
lightly
on
his
arm
,
as
lightly
as
when
she
had
danced
with
him
a
few
*NL*
hours
before
.
He
had
felt
proud
and
happy
then
,
happy
that
she
was
his
,
*NL*
proud
of
her
grace
and
wifely
carriage
.
But
now
,
after
the
kindling
*NL*
again
of
so
many
memories
,
the
first
touch
of
her
body
,
musical
and
*NL*
strange
and
perfumed
,
sent
through
him
a
keen
pang
of
lust
.
Under
cover
*NL*
of
her
silence
he
pressed
her
arm
closely
to
his
side
;
and
,
as
they
*NL*
stood
at
the
hotel
door
,
he
felt
that
they
had
escaped
from
their
lives
*NL*
and
duties
,
escaped
from
home
and
friends
and
run
away
together
with
*NL*
wild
and
radiant
hearts
to
a
new
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
man
was
dozing
in
a
great
hooded
chair
in
the
hall
.
He
lit
a
*NL*
candle
in
the
office
and
went
before
them
to
the
stairs
.
They
followed
*NL*
him
in
silence
,
their
feet
falling
in
soft
thuds
on
the
thickly
carpeted
*NL*
stairs
.
She
mounted
the
stairs
behind
the
porter
,
her
head
bowed
in
*NL*
the
ascent
,
her
frail
shoulders
curved
as
with
a
burden
,
her
skirt
girt
*NL*
tightly
about
her
.
He
could
have
flung
his
arms
about
her
hips
and
held
*NL*
her
still
,
for
his
arms
were
trembling
with
desire
to
seize
her
and
only
*NL*
the
stress
of
his
nails
against
the
palms
of
his
hands
held
the
wild
*NL*
impulse
of
his
body
in
check
.
The
porter
halted
on
the
stairs
to
settle
*NL*
his
guttering
candle
.
They
halted
,
too
,
on
the
steps
below
him
.
In
the
*NL*
silence
Gabriel
could
hear
the
falling
of
the
molten
wax
into
the
tray
*NL*
and
the
thumping
of
his
own
heart
against
his
ribs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
led
them
along
a
corridor
and
opened
a
door
.
Then
he
set
his
*NL*
unstable
candle
down
on
a
toilet-table
and
asked
at
what
hour
they
were
*NL*
to
be
called
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
pointed
to
the
tap
of
the
electric-light
and
began
a
muttered
*NL*
apology
,
but
Gabriel
cut
him
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
want
any
light
.
We
have
light
enough
from
the
street
.
And
I
*NL*
say
,
''
he
added
,
pointing
to
the
candle
,
``
you
might
remove
that
handsome
*NL*
article
,
like
a
good
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
took
up
his
candle
again
,
but
slowly
,
for
he
was
surprised
by
*NL*
such
a
novel
idea
.
Then
he
mumbled
good-night
and
went
out
.
Gabriel
shot
*NL*
the
lock
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
ghostly
light
from
the
street
lamp
lay
in
a
long
shaft
from
one
window
*NL*
to
the
door
.
Gabriel
threw
his
overcoat
and
hat
on
a
couch
and
crossed
*NL*
the
room
towards
the
window
.
He
looked
down
into
the
street
in
order
*NL*
that
his
emotion
might
calm
a
little
.
Then
he
turned
and
leaned
against
*NL*
a
chest
of
drawers
with
his
back
to
the
light
.
She
had
taken
off
her
hat
*NL*
and
cloak
and
was
standing
before
a
large
swinging
mirror
,
unhooking
her
*NL*
waist
.
Gabriel
paused
for
a
few
moments
,
watching
her
,
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gretta
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
from
the
mirror
slowly
and
walked
along
the
shaft
of
*NL*
light
towards
him
.
Her
face
looked
so
serious
and
weary
that
the
words
*NL*
would
not
pass
Gabriel
's
lips
.
No
,
it
was
not
the
moment
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
looked
tired
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
little
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
feel
ill
or
weak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
tired
:
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
to
the
window
and
stood
there
,
looking
out
.
Gabriel
waited
*NL*
again
and
then
,
fearing
that
diffidence
was
about
to
conquer
him
,
he
*NL*
said
abruptly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
Gretta
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
poor
fellow
Malins
?
''
he
said
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
What
about
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
poor
fellow
,
he
's
a
decent
sort
of
chap
,
after
all
,
''
continued
*NL*
Gabriel
in
a
false
voice
.
``
He
gave
me
back
that
sovereign
I
lent
him
,
*NL*
and
I
did
n't
expect
it
,
really
.
It
's
a
pity
he
would
n't
keep
away
from
*NL*
that
Browne
,
because
he
's
not
a
bad
fellow
,
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
trembling
now
with
annoyance
.
Why
did
she
seem
so
abstracted
?
He
*NL*
did
not
know
how
he
could
begin
.
Was
she
annoyed
,
too
,
about
something
?
*NL*
If
she
would
only
turn
to
him
or
come
to
him
of
her
own
accord
!
To
take
*NL*
her
as
she
was
would
be
brutal
.
No
,
he
must
see
some
ardour
in
her
eyes
*NL*
first
.
He
longed
to
be
master
of
her
strange
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
lend
him
the
pound
?
''
she
asked
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
strove
to
restrain
himself
from
breaking
out
into
brutal
*NL*
language
about
the
sottish
Malins
and
his
pound
.
He
longed
to
cry
to
her
*NL*
from
his
soul
,
to
crush
her
body
against
his
,
to
overmaster
her
.
But
he
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
at
Christmas
,
when
he
opened
that
little
Christmas-card
shop
in
*NL*
Henry
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
such
a
fever
of
rage
and
desire
that
he
did
not
hear
her
come
*NL*
from
the
window
.
She
stood
before
him
for
an
instant
,
looking
at
him
*NL*
strangely
.
Then
,
suddenly
raising
herself
on
tiptoe
and
resting
her
*NL*
hands
lightly
on
his
shoulders
,
she
kissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
very
generous
person
,
Gabriel
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
,
trembling
with
delight
at
her
sudden
kiss
and
at
the
quaintness
*NL*
of
her
phrase
,
put
his
hands
on
her
hair
and
began
smoothing
it
back
,
*NL*
scarcely
touching
it
with
his
fingers
.
The
washing
had
made
it
fine
and
*NL*
brilliant
.
His
heart
was
brimming
over
with
happiness
.
Just
when
he
*NL*
was
wishing
for
it
she
had
come
to
him
of
her
own
accord
.
Perhaps
her
*NL*
thoughts
had
been
running
with
his
.
Perhaps
she
had
felt
the
impetuous
*NL*
desire
that
was
in
him
,
and
then
the
yielding
mood
had
come
upon
her
.
*NL*
Now
that
she
had
fallen
to
him
so
easily
,
he
wondered
why
he
had
been
so
*NL*
diffident
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
,
holding
her
head
between
his
hands
.
Then
,
slipping
one
arm
*NL*
swiftly
about
her
body
and
drawing
her
towards
him
,
he
said
softly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gretta
,
dear
,
what
are
you
thinking
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
nor
yield
wholly
to
his
arm
.
He
said
again
,
softly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
what
it
is
,
Gretta
.
I
think
I
know
what
is
the
matter
.
Do
I
*NL*
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
at
once
.
Then
she
said
in
an
outburst
of
tears
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
am
thinking
about
that
song
,
The
Lass
of
Aughrim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
loose
from
him
and
ran
to
the
bed
and
,
throwing
her
arms
*NL*
across
the
bed-rail
,
hid
her
face
.
Gabriel
stood
stock-still
for
a
moment
*NL*
in
astonishment
and
then
followed
her
.
As
he
passed
in
the
way
of
the
*NL*
cheval-glass
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
full
length
,
his
broad
,
*NL*
well-filled
shirt-front
,
the
face
whose
expression
always
puzzled
him
*NL*
when
he
saw
it
in
a
mirror
,
and
his
glimmering
gilt-rimmed
eyeglasses
.
*NL*
He
halted
a
few
paces
from
her
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
the
song
?
Why
does
that
make
you
cry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
head
from
her
arms
and
dried
her
eyes
with
the
back
of
*NL*
her
hand
like
a
child
.
A
kinder
note
than
he
had
intended
went
into
his
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Gretta
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
about
a
person
long
ago
who
used
to
sing
that
song
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
was
the
person
long
ago
?
''
asked
Gabriel
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
person
I
used
to
know
in
Galway
when
I
was
living
with
my
*NL*
grandmother
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smile
passed
away
from
Gabriel
's
face
.
A
dull
anger
began
to
gather
*NL*
again
at
the
back
of
his
mind
and
the
dull
fires
of
his
lust
began
to
*NL*
glow
angrily
in
his
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Someone
you
were
in
love
with
?
''
he
asked
ironically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
young
boy
I
used
to
know
,
''
she
answered
,
``
named
Michael
Furey
.
*NL*
He
used
to
sing
that
song
,
The
Lass
of
Aughrim
.
He
was
very
delicate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
was
silent
.
He
did
not
wish
her
to
think
that
he
was
interested
*NL*
in
this
delicate
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
see
him
so
plainly
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
moment
.
``
Such
eyes
as
he
*NL*
had
:
big
,
dark
eyes
!
And
such
an
expression
in
them
--
an
expression
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
then
,
you
are
in
love
with
him
?
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
go
out
walking
with
him
,
''
she
said
,
``
when
I
was
in
Galway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
thought
flew
across
Gabriel
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
that
was
why
you
wanted
to
go
to
Galway
with
that
Ivors
girl
?
''
*NL*
he
said
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
and
asked
in
surprise
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
made
Gabriel
feel
awkward
.
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
I
know
?
To
see
him
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
away
from
him
along
the
shaft
of
light
towards
the
window
in
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dead
,
''
she
said
at
length
.
``
He
died
when
he
was
only
seventeen
.
*NL*
Is
n't
it
a
terrible
thing
to
die
so
young
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
he
?
''
asked
Gabriel
,
still
ironically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
in
the
gasworks
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
felt
humiliated
by
the
failure
of
his
irony
and
by
the
evocation
*NL*
of
this
figure
from
the
dead
,
a
boy
in
the
gasworks
.
While
he
had
been
*NL*
full
of
memories
of
their
secret
life
together
,
full
of
tenderness
and
*NL*
joy
and
desire
,
she
had
been
comparing
him
in
her
mind
with
another
.
A
*NL*
shameful
consciousness
of
his
own
person
assailed
him
.
He
saw
himself
*NL*
as
a
ludicrous
figure
,
acting
as
a
pennyboy
for
his
aunts
,
a
nervous
,
*NL*
well-meaning
sentimentalist
,
orating
to
vulgarians
and
idealising
his
*NL*
own
clownish
lusts
,
the
pitiable
fatuous
fellow
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
in
the
mirror
.
Instinctively
he
turned
his
back
more
to
the
light
*NL*
lest
she
might
see
the
shame
that
burned
upon
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
keep
up
his
tone
of
cold
interrogation
,
but
his
voice
when
*NL*
he
spoke
was
humble
and
indifferent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
were
in
love
with
this
Michael
Furey
,
Gretta
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
great
with
him
at
that
time
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
was
veiled
and
sad
.
Gabriel
,
feeling
now
how
vain
it
would
be
*NL*
to
try
to
lead
her
whither
he
had
purposed
,
caressed
one
of
her
hands
*NL*
and
said
,
also
sadly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
die
of
so
young
,
Gretta
?
Consumption
,
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
died
for
me
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
vague
terror
seized
Gabriel
at
this
answer
,
as
if
,
at
that
hour
when
*NL*
he
had
hoped
to
triumph
,
some
impalpable
and
vindictive
being
was
coming
*NL*
against
him
,
gathering
forces
against
him
in
its
vague
world
.
But
he
*NL*
shook
himself
free
of
it
with
an
effort
of
reason
and
continued
to
*NL*
caress
her
hand
.
He
did
not
question
her
again
,
for
he
felt
that
she
*NL*
would
tell
him
of
herself
.
Her
hand
was
warm
and
moist
:
it
did
not
*NL*
respond
to
his
touch
,
but
he
continued
to
caress
it
just
as
he
had
*NL*
caressed
her
first
letter
to
him
that
spring
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
in
the
winter
,
''
she
said
,
``
about
the
beginning
of
the
winter
*NL*
when
I
was
going
to
leave
my
grandmother
's
and
come
up
here
to
the
*NL*
convent
.
And
he
was
ill
at
the
time
in
his
lodgings
in
Galway
and
*NL*
would
n't
be
let
out
,
and
his
people
in
Oughterard
were
written
to
.
*NL*
He
was
in
decline
,
they
said
,
or
something
like
that
.
I
never
knew
*NL*
rightly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
for
a
moment
and
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
was
very
fond
of
me
and
he
was
such
a
*NL*
gentle
boy
.
We
used
to
go
out
together
,
walking
,
you
know
,
Gabriel
,
like
*NL*
the
way
they
do
in
the
country
.
He
was
going
to
study
singing
only
for
*NL*
his
health
.
He
had
a
very
good
voice
,
poor
Michael
Furey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
and
then
?
''
asked
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
when
it
came
to
the
time
for
me
to
leave
Galway
and
come
up
to
*NL*
the
convent
he
was
much
worse
and
I
would
n't
be
let
see
him
so
I
wrote
*NL*
him
a
letter
saying
I
was
going
up
to
Dublin
and
would
be
back
in
the
*NL*
summer
,
and
hoping
he
would
be
better
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
for
a
moment
to
get
her
voice
under
control
,
and
then
went
*NL*
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
night
before
I
left
,
I
was
in
my
grandmother
's
house
in
Nuns
'
*NL*
Island
,
packing
up
,
and
I
heard
gravel
thrown
up
against
the
window
.
*NL*
The
window
was
so
wet
I
could
n't
see
,
so
I
ran
downstairs
as
I
was
and
*NL*
slipped
out
the
back
into
the
garden
and
there
was
the
poor
fellow
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
garden
,
shivering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
not
tell
him
to
go
back
?
''
asked
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
implored
of
him
to
go
home
at
once
and
told
him
he
would
get
his
*NL*
death
in
the
rain
.
But
he
said
he
did
not
want
to
live
.
I
can
see
his
*NL*
eyes
as
well
as
well
!
He
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
wall
where
there
*NL*
was
a
tree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
he
go
home
?
''
asked
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
went
home
.
And
when
I
was
only
a
week
in
the
convent
he
died
*NL*
and
he
was
buried
in
Oughterard
,
where
his
people
came
from
.
O
,
the
day
*NL*
I
heard
that
,
that
he
was
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
,
choking
with
sobs
,
and
,
overcome
by
emotion
,
flung
herself
*NL*
face
downward
on
the
bed
,
sobbing
in
the
quilt
.
Gabriel
held
her
hand
*NL*
for
a
moment
longer
,
irresolutely
,
and
then
,
shy
of
intruding
on
her
*NL*
grief
,
let
it
fall
gently
and
walked
quietly
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
,
leaning
on
his
elbow
,
looked
for
a
few
moments
unresentfully
*NL*
on
her
tangled
hair
and
half-open
mouth
,
listening
to
her
deep-drawn
*NL*
breath
.
So
she
had
had
that
romance
in
her
life
:
a
man
had
died
for
her
*NL*
sake
.
It
hardly
pained
him
now
to
think
how
poor
a
part
he
,
her
husband
,
*NL*
had
played
in
her
life
.
He
watched
her
while
she
slept
,
as
though
he
and
*NL*
she
had
never
lived
together
as
man
and
wife
.
His
curious
eyes
rested
*NL*
long
upon
her
face
and
on
her
hair
:
and
,
as
he
thought
of
what
she
must
*NL*
have
been
then
,
in
that
time
of
her
first
girlish
beauty
,
a
strange
,
*NL*
friendly
pity
for
her
entered
his
soul
.
He
did
not
like
to
say
even
to
*NL*
himself
that
her
face
was
no
longer
beautiful
,
but
he
knew
that
it
was
*NL*
no
longer
the
face
for
which
Michael
Furey
had
braved
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
had
not
told
him
all
the
story
.
His
eyes
moved
to
the
*NL*
chair
over
which
she
had
thrown
some
of
her
clothes
.
A
petticoat
string
*NL*
dangled
to
the
floor
.
One
boot
stood
upright
,
its
limp
upper
fallen
*NL*
down
:
the
fellow
of
it
lay
upon
its
side
.
He
wondered
at
his
riot
of
*NL*
emotions
of
an
hour
before
.
From
what
had
it
proceeded
?
From
his
aunt
's
*NL*
supper
,
from
his
own
foolish
speech
,
from
the
wine
and
dancing
,
the
*NL*
merry-making
when
saying
good-night
in
the
hall
,
the
pleasure
of
the
*NL*
walk
along
the
river
in
the
snow
.
Poor
Aunt
Julia
!
She
,
too
,
would
soon
*NL*
be
a
shade
with
the
shade
of
Patrick
Morkan
and
his
horse
.
He
had
*NL*
caught
that
haggard
look
upon
her
face
for
a
moment
when
she
was
singing
*NL*
Arrayed
for
the
Bridal
.
Soon
,
perhaps
,
he
would
be
sitting
in
that
same
*NL*
drawing-room
,
dressed
in
black
,
his
silk
hat
on
his
knees
.
The
blinds
*NL*
would
be
drawn
down
and
Aunt
Kate
would
be
sitting
beside
him
,
crying
*NL*
and
blowing
her
nose
and
telling
him
how
Julia
had
died
.
He
would
cast
*NL*
about
in
his
mind
for
some
words
that
might
console
her
,
and
would
find
*NL*
only
lame
and
useless
ones
.
Yes
,
yes
:
that
would
happen
very
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
of
the
room
chilled
his
shoulders
.
He
stretched
himself
*NL*
cautiously
along
under
the
sheets
and
lay
down
beside
his
wife
.
One
by
*NL*
one
,
they
were
all
becoming
shades
.
Better
pass
boldly
into
that
other
*NL*
world
,
in
the
full
glory
of
some
passion
,
than
fade
and
wither
dismally
*NL*
with
age
.
He
thought
of
how
she
who
lay
beside
him
had
locked
in
her
*NL*
heart
for
so
many
years
that
image
of
her
lover
's
eyes
when
he
had
told
*NL*
her
that
he
did
not
wish
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
Generous
tears
filled
Gabriel
's
eyes
.
He
had
never
felt
like
that
*NL*
himself
towards
any
woman
,
but
he
knew
that
such
a
feeling
must
be
love
.
*NL*
The
tears
gathered
more
thickly
in
his
eyes
and
in
the
partial
darkness
*NL*
he
imagined
he
saw
the
form
of
a
young
man
standing
under
a
dripping
*NL*
tree
.
Other
forms
were
near
.
His
soul
had
approached
that
region
where
*NL*
dwell
the
vast
hosts
of
the
dead
.
He
was
conscious
of
,
but
could
not
*NL*
apprehend
,
their
wayward
and
flickering
existence
.
His
own
identity
was
*NL*
fading
out
into
a
grey
impalpable
world
:
the
solid
world
itself
,
*NL*
which
these
dead
had
one
time
reared
and
lived
in
,
was
dissolving
and
*NL*
dwindling
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
light
taps
upon
the
pane
made
him
turn
to
the
window
.
It
had
begun
*NL*
to
snow
again
.
He
watched
sleepily
the
flakes
,
silver
and
dark
,
falling
*NL*
obliquely
against
the
lamplight
.
The
time
had
come
for
him
to
set
out
on
*NL*
his
journey
westward
.
Yes
,
the
newspapers
were
right
:
snow
was
general
*NL*
all
over
Ireland
.
It
was
falling
on
every
part
of
the
dark
central
*NL*
plain
,
on
the
treeless
hills
,
falling
softly
upon
the
Bog
of
Allen
and
,
*NL*
farther
westward
,
softly
falling
into
the
dark
mutinous
Shannon
waves
.
*NL*
It
was
falling
,
too
,
upon
every
part
of
the
lonely
churchyard
on
the
*NL*
hill
where
Michael
Furey
lay
buried
.
It
lay
thickly
drifted
on
the
*NL*
crooked
crosses
and
headstones
,
on
the
spears
of
the
little
gate
,
on
*NL*
the
barren
thorns
.
His
soul
swooned
slowly
as
he
heard
the
snow
falling
*NL*
faintly
through
the
universe
and
faintly
falling
,
like
the
descent
of
*NL*
their
last
end
,
upon
all
the
living
and
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
