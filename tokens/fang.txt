CHAPTER

--
THE
TRAIL
OF
THE
MEAT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dark
spruce
forest
frowned
on
either
side
the
frozen
waterway
.
The
trees
*NL*
had
been
stripped
by
a
recent
wind
of
their
white
covering
of
frost
,
and
*NL*
they
seemed
to
lean
towards
each
other
,
black
and
ominous
,
in
the
fading
*NL*
light
.
A
vast
silence
reigned
over
the
land
.
The
land
itself
was
a
*NL*
desolation
,
lifeless
,
without
movement
,
so
lone
and
cold
that
the
spirit
*NL*
of
it
was
not
even
that
of
sadness
.
There
was
a
hint
in
it
of
laughter
,
*NL*
but
of
a
laughter
more
terrible
than
any
sadness
--
a
laughter
that
was
*NL*
mirthless
as
the
smile
of
the
sphinx
,
a
laughter
cold
as
the
frost
and
*NL*
partaking
of
the
grimness
of
infallibility
.
It
was
the
masterful
and
*NL*
incommunicable
wisdom
of
eternity
laughing
at
the
futility
of
life
and
*NL*
the
effort
of
life
.
It
was
the
Wild
,
the
savage
,
frozen-hearted
*NL*
Northland
Wild
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
_
was
_
life
,
abroad
in
the
land
and
defiant
.
Down
the
frozen
*NL*
waterway
toiled
a
string
of
wolfish
dogs
.
Their
bristly
fur
was
rimed
*NL*
with
frost
.
Their
breath
froze
in
the
air
as
it
left
their
mouths
,
*NL*
spouting
forth
in
spumes
of
vapour
that
settled
upon
the
hair
of
their
*NL*
bodies
and
formed
into
crystals
of
frost
.
Leather
harness
was
on
the
*NL*
dogs
,
and
leather
traces
attached
them
to
a
sled
which
dragged
along
*NL*
behind
.
The
sled
was
without
runners
.
It
was
made
of
stout
birch-bark
,
*NL*
and
its
full
surface
rested
on
the
snow
.
The
front
end
of
the
sled
was
*NL*
turned
up
,
like
a
scroll
,
in
order
to
force
down
and
under
the
bore
of
*NL*
soft
snow
that
surged
like
a
wave
before
it
.
On
the
sled
,
securely
*NL*
lashed
,
was
a
long
and
narrow
oblong
box
.
There
were
other
things
on
the
*NL*
sled
--
blankets
,
an
axe
,
and
a
coffee-pot
and
frying-pan
;
but
prominent
,
*NL*
occupying
most
of
the
space
,
was
the
long
and
narrow
oblong
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
advance
of
the
dogs
,
on
wide
snowshoes
,
toiled
a
man
.
At
the
rear
of
*NL*
the
sled
toiled
a
second
man
.
On
the
sled
,
in
the
box
,
lay
a
third
man
*NL*
whose
toil
was
over
,
--
a
man
whom
the
Wild
had
conquered
and
beaten
down
*NL*
until
he
would
never
move
nor
struggle
again
.
It
is
not
the
way
of
the
*NL*
Wild
to
like
movement
.
Life
is
an
offence
to
it
,
for
life
is
movement
;
*NL*
and
the
Wild
aims
always
to
destroy
movement
.
It
freezes
the
water
to
*NL*
prevent
it
running
to
the
sea
;
it
drives
the
sap
out
of
the
trees
till
*NL*
they
are
frozen
to
their
mighty
hearts
;
and
most
ferociously
and
terribly
*NL*
of
all
does
the
Wild
harry
and
crush
into
submission
man
--
man
who
is
the
*NL*
most
restless
of
life
,
ever
in
revolt
against
the
dictum
that
all
*NL*
movement
must
in
the
end
come
to
the
cessation
of
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
front
and
rear
,
unawed
and
indomitable
,
toiled
the
two
men
who
*NL*
were
not
yet
dead
.
Their
bodies
were
covered
with
fur
and
soft-tanned
*NL*
leather
.
Eyelashes
and
cheeks
and
lips
were
so
coated
with
the
crystals
*NL*
from
their
frozen
breath
that
their
faces
were
not
discernible
.
This
*NL*
gave
them
the
seeming
of
ghostly
masques
,
undertakers
in
a
spectral
world
*NL*
at
the
funeral
of
some
ghost
.
But
under
it
all
they
were
men
,
*NL*
penetrating
the
land
of
desolation
and
mockery
and
silence
,
puny
*NL*
adventurers
bent
on
colossal
adventure
,
pitting
themselves
against
the
*NL*
might
of
a
world
as
remote
and
alien
and
pulseless
as
the
abysses
of
*NL*
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
travelled
on
without
speech
,
saving
their
breath
for
the
work
of
*NL*
their
bodies
.
On
every
side
was
the
silence
,
pressing
upon
them
with
a
*NL*
tangible
presence
.
It
affected
their
minds
as
the
many
atmospheres
of
*NL*
deep
water
affect
the
body
of
the
diver
.
It
crushed
them
with
the
weight
*NL*
of
unending
vastness
and
unalterable
decree
.
It
crushed
them
into
the
*NL*
remotest
recesses
of
their
own
minds
,
pressing
out
of
them
,
like
juices
*NL*
from
the
grape
,
all
the
false
ardours
and
exaltations
and
undue
*NL*
self-values
of
the
human
soul
,
until
they
perceived
themselves
finite
and
*NL*
small
,
specks
and
motes
,
moving
with
weak
cunning
and
little
wisdom
*NL*
amidst
the
play
and
inter-play
of
the
great
blind
elements
and
forces
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
went
by
,
and
a
second
hour
.
The
pale
light
of
the
short
sunless
*NL*
day
was
beginning
to
fade
,
when
a
faint
far
cry
arose
on
the
still
air
.
*NL*
It
soared
upward
with
a
swift
rush
,
till
it
reached
its
topmost
note
,
*NL*
where
it
persisted
,
palpitant
and
tense
,
and
then
slowly
died
away
.
It
*NL*
might
have
been
a
lost
soul
wailing
,
had
it
not
been
invested
with
a
*NL*
certain
sad
fierceness
and
hungry
eagerness
.
The
front
man
turned
his
*NL*
head
until
his
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
the
man
behind
.
And
then
,
across
the
*NL*
narrow
oblong
box
,
each
nodded
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
cry
arose
,
piercing
the
silence
with
needle-like
shrillness
.
*NL*
Both
men
located
the
sound
.
It
was
to
the
rear
,
somewhere
in
the
snow
*NL*
expanse
they
had
just
traversed
.
A
third
and
answering
cry
arose
,
also
*NL*
to
the
rear
and
to
the
left
of
the
second
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
after
us
,
Bill
,
''
said
the
man
at
the
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
unreal
,
and
he
had
spoken
with
apparent
*NL*
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meat
is
scarce
,
''
answered
his
comrade
.
``
I
ai
n't
seen
a
rabbit
sign
for
*NL*
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereafter
they
spoke
no
more
,
though
their
ears
were
keen
for
the
*NL*
hunting-cries
that
continued
to
rise
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
fall
of
darkness
they
swung
the
dogs
into
a
cluster
of
spruce
*NL*
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
waterway
and
made
a
camp
.
The
coffin
,
at
the
*NL*
side
of
the
fire
,
served
for
seat
and
table
.
The
wolf-dogs
,
clustered
on
*NL*
the
far
side
of
the
fire
,
snarled
and
bickered
among
themselves
,
but
*NL*
evinced
no
inclination
to
stray
off
into
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seems
to
me
,
Henry
,
they
're
stayin
'
remarkable
close
to
camp
,
''
Bill
*NL*
commented
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
,
squatting
over
the
fire
and
settling
the
pot
of
coffee
with
a
*NL*
piece
of
ice
,
nodded
.
Nor
did
he
speak
till
he
had
taken
his
seat
on
the
*NL*
coffin
and
begun
to
eat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
know
where
their
hides
is
safe
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
'd
sooner
eat
grub
*NL*
than
be
grub
.
They
're
pretty
wise
,
them
dogs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
shook
his
head
.
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
comrade
looked
at
him
curiously
.
``
First
time
I
ever
heard
you
say
*NL*
anything
about
their
not
bein
'
wise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
,
''
said
the
other
,
munching
with
deliberation
the
beans
he
was
*NL*
eating
,
``
did
you
happen
to
notice
the
way
them
dogs
kicked
up
when
I
was
*NL*
a-feedin
'
'em
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
did
cut
up
more
'n
usual
,
''
Henry
acknowledged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
dogs
've
we
got
,
Henry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Henry
...
''
Bill
stopped
for
a
moment
,
in
order
that
his
words
*NL*
might
gain
greater
significance
.
``
As
I
was
sayin
'
,
Henry
,
we
've
got
six
*NL*
dogs
.
I
took
six
fish
out
of
the
bag
.
I
gave
one
fish
to
each
dog
,
an
'
,
*NL*
Henry
,
I
was
one
fish
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
counted
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
got
six
dogs
,
''
the
other
reiterated
dispassionately
.
``
I
took
out
*NL*
six
fish
.
One
Ear
did
n't
get
no
fish
.
I
came
back
to
the
bag
afterward
*NL*
an
'
got
'm
his
fish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
only
got
six
dogs
,
''
Henry
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
,
''
Bill
went
on
.
``
I
wo
n't
say
they
was
all
dogs
,
but
there
was
*NL*
seven
of
'm
that
got
fish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
stopped
eating
to
glance
across
the
fire
and
count
the
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
only
six
now
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
the
other
one
run
off
across
the
snow
,
''
Bill
announced
with
cool
*NL*
positiveness
.
``
I
saw
seven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
looked
at
him
commiseratingly
,
and
said
,
``
I
'll
be
almighty
glad
*NL*
when
this
trip
's
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
d'ye
mean
by
that
?
''
Bill
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
this
load
of
ourn
is
gettin
'
on
your
nerves
,
an
'
that
you
're
*NL*
beginnin
'
to
see
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
of
that
,
''
Bill
answered
gravely
.
``
An
'
so
,
when
I
saw
it
run
*NL*
off
across
the
snow
,
I
looked
in
the
snow
an
'
saw
its
tracks
.
Then
I
*NL*
counted
the
dogs
an
'
there
was
still
six
of
'em
.
The
tracks
is
there
in
*NL*
the
snow
now
.
D'ye
want
to
look
at
'em
?
I
'll
show
'em
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
did
not
reply
,
but
munched
on
in
silence
,
until
,
the
meal
finished
,
*NL*
he
topped
it
with
a
final
cup
of
coffee
.
He
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
*NL*
back
of
his
hand
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
're
thinkin
'
as
it
was
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
wailing
cry
,
fiercely
sad
,
from
somewhere
in
the
darkness
,
had
*NL*
interrupted
him
.
He
stopped
to
listen
to
it
,
then
he
finished
his
*NL*
sentence
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
sound
of
the
cry
,
''
--
one
of
*NL*
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
nodded
.
``
I
'd
a
blame
sight
sooner
think
that
than
anything
else
.
*NL*
You
noticed
yourself
the
row
the
dogs
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cry
after
cry
,
and
answering
cries
,
were
turning
the
silence
into
a
*NL*
bedlam
.
From
every
side
the
cries
arose
,
and
the
dogs
betrayed
their
*NL*
fear
by
huddling
together
and
so
close
to
the
fire
that
their
hair
was
*NL*
scorched
by
the
heat
.
Bill
threw
on
more
wood
,
before
lighting
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
thinking
you
're
down
in
the
mouth
some
,
''
Henry
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
...
''
He
sucked
meditatively
at
his
pipe
for
some
time
before
*NL*
he
went
on
.
``
Henry
,
I
was
a-thinkin
'
what
a
blame
sight
luckier
he
is
*NL*
than
you
an
'
me
'll
ever
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
indicated
the
third
person
by
a
downward
thrust
of
the
thumb
to
the
*NL*
box
on
which
they
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
an
'
me
,
Henry
,
when
we
die
,
we
'll
be
lucky
if
we
get
enough
stones

over
our
carcases
to
keep
the
dogs
off
of
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
ai
n't
got
people
an

money

all
the
rest

Henry
*NL*
rejoined
.
``
Long-distance
funerals
is
somethin'
you

me
ca
n't
exactly
*NL*
afford

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
gets

is
what
a

a

something
in
his
own
country
,
and
that

never

about

*NL*
nor
blankets
;
why
he
comes
a-buttin

round
the
Godforsaken
ends
of
the
*NL*
earth
--
that
's
what
I
ca

exactly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might
have
lived
to
a
ripe
old
age
if
he
'd
stayed
at
home
,
''
Henry
*NL*
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
,
but
changed
his
mind
.
Instead
,
he
*NL*
pointed
towards
the
wall
of
darkness
that
pressed
about
them
from
every
*NL*
side
.
There
was
no
suggestion
of
form
in
the
utter
blackness
;
only
could
*NL*
be
seen
a
pair
of
eyes
gleaming
like
live
coals
.
Henry
indicated
with
*NL*
his
head
a
second
pair
,
and
a
third
.
A
circle
of
the
gleaming
eyes
had
*NL*
drawn
about
their
camp
.
Now
and
again
a
pair
of
eyes
moved
,
or
*NL*
disappeared
to
appear
again
a
moment
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unrest
of
the
dogs
had
been
increasing
,
and
they
stampeded
,
in
a
*NL*
surge
of
sudden
fear
,
to
the
near
side
of
the
fire
,
cringing
and
crawling
*NL*
about
the
legs
of
the
men
.
In
the
scramble
one
of
the
dogs
had
been
*NL*
overturned
on
the
edge
of
the
fire
,
and
it
had
yelped
with
pain
and
*NL*
fright
as
the
smell
of
its
singed
coat
possessed
the
air
.
The
commotion
*NL*
caused
the
circle
of
eyes
to
shift
restlessly
for
a
moment
and
even
to
*NL*
withdraw
a
bit
,
but
it
settled
down
again
as
the
dogs
became
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
,
it
's
a
blame
misfortune
to
be
out
of
ammunition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
had
finished
his
pipe
and
was
helping
his
companion
to
spread
the
*NL*
bed
of
fur
and
blanket
upon
the
spruce
boughs
which
he
had
laid
over
the
*NL*
snow
before
supper
.
Henry
grunted
,
and
began
unlacing
his
moccasins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
cartridges
did
you
say
you
had
left
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
,
''
came
the
answer
.
``
An
'
I
wisht
't
was
three
hundred
.
Then
I
'd
*NL*
show
'em
what
for

damn
'em
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
fist
angrily
at
the
gleaming
eyes
,
and
began
securely
to
*NL*
prop
his
moccasins
before
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
I
wisht
this
cold
snap
'd
break
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
It
's
ben
fifty
below

for
two
weeks
now

An

I
wisht
I
'd
never

Henry

I
*NL*
do
n't

cribbage
--
that
's
what
I
wisht
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
grunted
and
crawled
into
bed
.
As
he
dozed
off
he
was
aroused
by
*NL*
his
comrade
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Henry
,
that
other
one
that
come
in
an
'
got
a
fish
--
why
did
n't
the
*NL*
dogs
pitch
into
it
?
That
's
what
's
botherin

me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
botherin
'
too
much
,
Bill
,
''
came
the
sleepy
response
.
``
You

*NL*
never
like
this
before

You
jes

shut
up
now
,
an

go

*NL*
you
'll
be
all

in

.
Your
stomach
's
sour
,
that
's
*NL*
what
's
botherin
'
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
slept
,
breathing
heavily
,
side
by
side
,
under
the
one
covering
.
*NL*
The
fire
died
down
,
and
the
gleaming
eyes
drew
closer
the
circle
they
had
*NL*
flung
about
the
camp
.
The
dogs
clustered
together
in
fear
,
now
and
again
*NL*
snarling
menacingly
as
a
pair
of
eyes
drew
close
.
Once
their
uproar
*NL*
became
so
loud
that
Bill
woke
up
.
He
got
out
of
bed
carefully
,
so
as
not
*NL*
to
disturb
the
sleep
of
his
comrade
,
and
threw
more
wood
on
the
fire
.
As
*NL*
it
began
to
flame
up
,
the
circle
of
eyes
drew
farther
back
.
He
glanced
*NL*
casually
at
the
huddling
dogs
.
He
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
at
them
*NL*
more
sharply
.
Then
he
crawled
back
into
the
blankets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
,
''
he
said
.
``
Oh
,
Henry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
groaned
as
he
passed
from
sleep
to
waking
,
and
demanded
,
``
What
's
*NL*
wrong
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothin
'
,
''
came
the
answer
;
``
only
there
's
seven
of
'em
again
.
I
just
*NL*
counted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
acknowledged
receipt
of
the
information
with
a
grunt
that
slid
into
*NL*
a
snore
as
he
drifted
back
into
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
it
was
Henry
who
awoke
first
and
routed
his
companion
out
*NL*
of
bed
.
Daylight
was
yet
three
hours
away
,
though
it
was
already
six
*NL*
o'clock
;
and
in
the
darkness
Henry
went
about
preparing
breakfast
,
while
*NL*
Bill
rolled
the
blankets
and
made
the
sled
ready
for
lashing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Henry
,
''
he
asked
suddenly
,
``
how
many
dogs
did
you
say
we
had
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wrong
,
''
Bill
proclaimed
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
again
?
''
Henry
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
five
;
one
's
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hell
!
''
Henry
cried
in
wrath
,
leaving
the
cooking
to
come
and
count
*NL*
the
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
,
Bill
,
''
he
concluded
.
``
Fatty
's
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
he
went
like
greased
lightnin
'
once
he
got
started
.
Could
n't
've
*NL*
seen
'm
for
smoke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
chance
at
all
,
''
Henry
concluded
.
``
They
jes
'
swallowed
'm
alive
.
I
*NL*
bet
he
was
yelpin
'
as
he
went
down
their
throats
,
damn
'em
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
always
was
a
fool
dog
,
''
said
Bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
fool
dog
ought
to
be
fool
enough
to
go
off
an
'
commit
suicide
*NL*
that
way
.
''
He
looked
over
the
remainder
of
the
team
with
a
speculative
*NL*
eye
that
summed
up
instantly
the
salient
traits
of
each
animal
.
``
I
bet
*NL*
none
of
the
others
would
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
drive
'em
away
from
the
fire
with
a
club
,
''
Bill
agreed
.
``
I
*NL*
always
did
think
there
was
somethin'
wrong
with
Fatty
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
was
the
epitaph
of
a
dead
dog
on
the
Northland
trail
--
less
scant
*NL*
than
the
epitaph
of
many
another
dog
,
of
many
a
man
.

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
SHE-WOLF
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Breakfast
eaten
and
the
slim
camp-outfit
lashed
to
the
sled
,
the
men
*NL*
turned
their
backs
on
the
cheery
fire
and
launched
out
into
the
darkness
.
*NL*
At
once
began
to
rise
the
cries
that
were
fiercely
sad
--
cries
that
called
*NL*
through
the
darkness
and
cold
to
one
another
and
answered
back
.
*NL*
Conversation
ceased
.
Daylight
came
at
nine
o'clock
.
At
midday
the
sky
*NL*
to
the
south
warmed
to
rose-colour
,
and
marked
where
the
bulge
of
the
*NL*
earth
intervened
between
the
meridian
sun
and
the
northern
world
.
But
*NL*
the
rose-colour
swiftly
faded
.
The
grey
light
of
day
that
remained
*NL*
lasted
until
three
o'clock
,
when
it
,
too
,
faded
,
and
the
pall
of
the
*NL*
Arctic
night
descended
upon
the
lone
and
silent
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
darkness
came
on
,
the
hunting-cries
to
right
and
left
and
rear
drew
*NL*
closer
--
so
close
that
more
than
once
they
sent
surges
of
fear
through
the
*NL*
toiling
dogs
,
throwing
them
into
short-lived
panics
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
conclusion
of
one
such
panic
,
when
he
and
Henry
had
got
the
dogs
*NL*
back
in
the
traces
,
Bill
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wisht
they
'd
strike
game
somewheres
,
an
'
go
away
an
'
leave
us
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
get
on
the
nerves
horrible
,
''
Henry
sympathised
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
spoke
no
more
until
camp
was
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
was
bending
over
and
adding
ice
to
the
babbling
pot
of
beans
when
*NL*
he
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
blow
,
an
exclamation
from
Bill
,
and
a
*NL*
sharp
snarling
cry
of
pain
from
among
the
dogs
.
He
straightened
up
in
*NL*
time
to
see
a
dim
form
disappearing
across
the
snow
into
the
shelter
of
*NL*
the
dark
.
Then
he
saw
Bill
,
standing
amid
the
dogs
,
half
triumphant
,
*NL*
half
crestfallen
,
in
one
hand
a
stout
club
,
in
the
other
the
tail
and
*NL*
part
of
the
body
of
a
sun-cured
salmon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
got
half
of
it
,
''
he
announced
;
``
but
I
got
a
whack
at
it
jes
'
the
*NL*
same
.
D'ye
hear
it
squeal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
'd
it
look
like
?
''
Henry
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
see
.
But
it
had
four
legs
an
'
a
mouth
an
'
hair
an
'
looked
like
*NL*
any
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
be
a
tame
wolf
,
I
reckon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
damned
tame
,
whatever
it
is
,
comin
'
in
here
at
feedin
'
time
an
'
*NL*
gettin
'
its
whack
of
fish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
when
supper
was
finished
and
they
sat
on
the
oblong
box
and
*NL*
pulled
at
their
pipes
,
the
circle
of
gleaming
eyes
drew
in
even
closer
*NL*
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wisht
they
'd
spring
up
a
bunch
of
moose
or
something
,
an
'
go
away
an
'
*NL*
leave
us
alone
,
''
Bill
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
grunted
with
an
intonation
that
was
not
all
sympathy
,
and
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
they
sat
on
in
silence
,
Henry
staring
at
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
Bill
at
the
circle
of
eyes
that
burned
in
the
darkness
just
beyond
the
*NL*
firelight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wisht
we
was
pullin
'
into
McGurry
right
now
,
''
he
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up
your
wishin
'
and
your
croakin
'
,
''
Henry
burst
out
angrily
.
``
Your
*NL*
stomach
's
sour
.
That
's
what
's
ailin
'
you
.
Swallow
a
spoonful
of
sody
,
*NL*
an
'
you
'll
sweeten
up
wonderful
an
'
be
more
pleasant
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Henry
was
aroused
by
fervid
blasphemy
that
proceeded
from
*NL*
the
mouth
of
Bill
.
Henry
propped
himself
up
on
an
elbow
and
looked
to
*NL*
see
his
comrade
standing
among
the
dogs
beside
the
replenished
fire
,
his
*NL*
arms
raised
in
objurgation
,
his
face
distorted
with
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
Henry
called
.
``
What
's
up
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frog
's
gone
,
''
came
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
leaped
out
of
the
blankets
and
to
the
dogs
.
He
counted
them
with
*NL*
care
,
and
then
joined
his
partner
in
cursing
the
power
of
the
Wild
that
*NL*
had
robbed
them
of
another
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frog
was
the
strongest
dog
of
the
bunch
,
''
Bill
pronounced
finally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
he
was
no
fool
dog
neither
,
''
Henry
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
was
recorded
the
second
epitaph
in
two
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gloomy
breakfast
was
eaten
,
and
the
four
remaining
dogs
were
harnessed
*NL*
to
the
sled
.
The
day
was
a
repetition
of
the
days
that
had
gone
before
.
*NL*
The
men
toiled
without
speech
across
the
face
of
the
frozen
world
.
The
*NL*
silence
was
unbroken
save
by
the
cries
of
their
pursuers
,
that
,
unseen
,
*NL*
hung
upon
their
rear
.
With
the
coming
of
night
in
the
mid-afternoon
,
the
*NL*
cries
sounded
closer
as
the
pursuers
drew
in
according
to
their
custom
;
*NL*
and
the
dogs
grew
excited
and
frightened
,
and
were
guilty
of
panics
that
*NL*
tangled
the
traces
and
further
depressed
the
two
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
that
'll
fix
you
fool
critters
,
''
Bill
said
with
satisfaction
that
*NL*
night
,
standing
erect
at
completion
of
his
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
left
the
cooking
to
come
and
see
.
Not
only
had
his
partner
tied
*NL*
the
dogs
up
,
but
he
had
tied
them
,
after
the
Indian
fashion
,
with
sticks
.
*NL*
About
the
neck
of
each
dog
he
had
fastened
a
leather
thong
.
To
this
,
and
*NL*
so
close
to
the
neck
that
the
dog
could
not
get
his
teeth
to
it
,
he
had
*NL*
tied
a
stout
stick
four
or
five
feet
in
length
.
The
other
end
of
the
*NL*
stick
,
in
turn
,
was
made
fast
to
a
stake
in
the
ground
by
means
of
a
*NL*
leather
thong
.
The
dog
was
unable
to
gnaw
through
the
leather
at
his
own
*NL*
end
of
the
stick
.
The
stick
prevented
him
from
getting
at
the
leather
*NL*
that
fastened
the
other
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
nodded
his
head
approvingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
only
contraption
that
'll
ever
hold
One
Ear
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
can
*NL*
gnaw
through
leather
as
clean
as
a
knife
an
'
jes
'
about
half
as
quick
.
*NL*
They
all
'll
be
here
in
the
mornin
'
hunkydory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
jes
'
bet
they
will
,
''
Bill
affirmed
.
``
If
one
of
em
'
turns
up
*NL*
missin
'
,
I
'll
go
without
my
coffee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
jes
'
know
we
ai
n't
loaded
to
kill
,
''
Henry
remarked
at
bed-time
,
*NL*
indicating
the
gleaming
circle
that
hemmed
them
in
.
``
If
we
could
put
a
*NL*
couple
of
shots
into
'em
,
they
'd
be
more
respectful
.
They
come
closer
*NL*
every
night
.
Get
the
firelight
out
of
your
eyes
an
'
look
hard
--
there
!
*NL*
Did
you
see
that
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
the
two
men
amused
themselves
with
watching
the
movement
of
*NL*
vague
forms
on
the
edge
of
the
firelight
.
By
looking
closely
and
*NL*
steadily
at
where
a
pair
of
eyes
burned
in
the
darkness
,
the
form
of
the
*NL*
animal
would
slowly
take
shape
.
They
could
even
see
these
forms
move
at
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sound
among
the
dogs
attracted
the
men
's
attention
.
One
Ear
was
*NL*
uttering
quick
,
eager
whines
,
lunging
at
the
length
of
his
stick
toward
*NL*
the
darkness
,
and
desisting
now
and
again
in
order
to
make
frantic
*NL*
attacks
on
the
stick
with
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
,
Bill
,
''
Henry
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Full
into
the
firelight
,
with
a
stealthy
,
sidelong
movement
,
glided
a
*NL*
doglike
animal
.
It
moved
with
commingled
mistrust
and
daring
,
cautiously
*NL*
observing
the
men
,
its
attention
fixed
on
the
dogs
.
One
Ear
strained
the
*NL*
full
length
of
the
stick
toward
the
intruder
and
whined
with
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

in

*NL*

Henry
whispered
back
,

*NL*
*NL*
The
fire
crackled
.
A
log
fell
apart
with
a
loud
spluttering
noise
.
At
*NL*
the
sound
of
it
the
strange
animal
leaped
back
into
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
the
slightest

in

was
Henry
's
response
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An

right
here
I
want
to

Bill
went
on
,
``
that

Henry

*NL*

aloud

*NL*
``
But

Henry
objected

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
wait

the

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Henry
renewed
the
fire
and
cooked
breakfast
to
the
*NL*
accompaniment
of
his
partner
's
snoring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
was
sleepin

Henry
told
him

as

he
routed
him
out
for
breakfast
.
``
I
had
n't
the
heart
to
rouse
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
began
to
eat
sleepily
.
He
noticed
that
his
cup
was
empty
and
*NL*
started
to
reach
for
the
pot
.
But
the
pot
was
beyond
arm
's
length
and
*NL*
beside
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

Henry
,
''
he
chided
gently
,
``
ai
n't
you
forgot
somethin'

''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
looked
about
with
great
carefulness
and
shook
his
head
.
Bill
held
*NL*
up
the
empty
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
get
no
coffee

''
Henry
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai

Bill
asked
anxiously

*NL*
``
Nope

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nope

*NL*
*NL*
A
flush
of
angry
blood
pervaded
Bill
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spanker

Henry
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
haste
,
with
the
air
of
one
resigned
to
misfortune
Bill
turned
his
*NL*
head
,
and
from
where
he
sat
counted
the
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
'd
it
happen

he
asked
apathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

Bill
spoke
gravely

slowly
,
with
no
hint
of
the
*NL*
anger
that
was
raging
within
.

because

over
the

bellies
of

different

was
Henry
's
epitaph
on
this
,
the
latest
lost
dog
.
``
Have
some
*NL*
coffee

Bill
.

*NL*
*NL*
But
Bill
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
''
Henry
pleaded
,
elevating
the
pot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
shoved
his
cup
aside
.
``
I
'll
be
ding-dong-danged

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's

good
coffee

Henry
said
enticingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Bill
was
stubborn
,
and
he
ate
a
dry
breakfast
washed
down
with
*NL*
mumbled
curses
at
One
Ear
for
the
trick
he
had
played
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tie
'em
up
out
of
reach
of
each
other
to-night
,
''
Bill
said
,
as
they
*NL*
took
the
trail
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
travelled
little
more
than
a
hundred
yards
,
when
Henry
,
who
was
*NL*
in
front
,
bent
down
and
picked
up
something
with
which
his
snowshoe
had
*NL*
collided
.
It
was
dark
,
and
he
could
not
see
it
,
but
he
recognised
it
by
*NL*
the
touch
.
He
flung
it
back
,
so
that
it
struck
the
sled
and
bounced
*NL*
along
until
it
fetched
up
on
Bill
's
snowshoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mebbe
you
'll
need
that
in
your
business
,
''
Henry
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
uttered
an
exclamation
.
It
was
all
that
was
left
of
Spanker
--
the
*NL*
stick
with
which
he
had
been
tied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ate
'm
hide
an
'
all
,
''
Bill
announced
.
``
The
stick
's
as
clean
as
a
*NL*
whistle

They
've
ate
the
leather
offen
both
ends

're
damn
hungry

*NL*
Henry

'll
have
you
an

guessin

before

trip
's
over

''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
laughed
defiantly
.
``
I
ai
n't
been
trailed
this
way
by
wolves

before

but
I
've
gone
through
a
whole
lot
worse
an

kept
my
health

Takes
*NL*
more
'n
a
handful
of
them
pesky
critters
to
do
for
yours

Bill

son

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

I
do
n't
know

Bill
muttered
ominously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
know
all
right
when
we
pull
into
McGurry
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ai
n't
feelin

special
enthusiastic

Bill
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
off
colour
,
that
's
what
's
the
matter
with
you
,

Henry
dogmatised
.
*NL*
``
What
you
need
is
quinine

I

to
dose
you
up

as
soon

we
make
McGurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
grunted
his
disagreement
with
the
diagnosis
,
and
lapsed
into
*NL*
silence
.
The
day
was
like
all
the
days
.
Light
came
at
nine
o'clock
.
At
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
the
southern
horizon
was
warmed
by
the
unseen
sun
;
and
*NL*
then
began
the
cold
grey
of
afternoon
that
would
merge
,
three
hours
*NL*
later
,
into
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
after
the
sun
's
futile
effort
to
appear
,
that
Bill
slipped
*NL*
the
rifle
from
under
the
sled-lashings
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
keep
right
on
,
Henry
,
I
'm
goin
'
to
see
what
I
can
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
stick
by
the
sled
,
''
his
partner
protested
.
``
You
've
only
*NL*
got
three
cartridges
,
an
'
there
's
no
tellin
'
what
might
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
croaking
now
?
''
Bill
demanded
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
made
no
reply
,
and
plodded
on
alone
,
though
often
he
cast
anxious
*NL*
glances
back
into
the
grey
solitude
where
his
partner
had
disappeared
.
An
*NL*
hour
later
,
taking
advantage
of
the
cut-offs
around
which
the
sled
had
to
*NL*
go
,
Bill
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
scattered
an
'
rangin
'
along
wide
,
''
he
said
:
``
keeping
up
with
us
*NL*
an
'
lookin
'
for
game
at
the
same
time
.
You
see
,
they
're
sure
of
us
,
only
*NL*
they
know
they
've
got
to
wait
to
get
us
.
In
the
meantime
they
're
willin
'
*NL*
to
pick
up
anything
eatable
that
comes
handy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
they
_
think
_
they
're
sure
of
us
,
''
Henry
objected
pointedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Bill
ignored
him
.
``
I
seen
some
of
them
.
They
're
pretty
thin
.
They
*NL*
ai
n't
had
a
bite
in
weeks
I
reckon
,
outside
of
Fatty
an

Frog

'
*NL*
Spanker
;
an

there
's
so
many
of
'em
that
that
did
n't
go
far

They
're
*NL*
remarkable
thin
.
Their
ribs
is
like
wash-boards
,
an
'
their
stomachs
is
*NL*
right
up
against
their
backbones
.
They
're
pretty
desperate
,
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
.
They
'll
be
goin
'
mad
,
yet
,
an

then
watch
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
,
Henry
,
who
was
now
travelling
behind
the
sled
,
*NL*
emitted
a
low
,
warning
whistle
.
Bill
turned
and
looked
,
then
quietly
*NL*
stopped
the
dogs
.
To
the
rear
,
from
around
the
last
bend
and
plainly
*NL*
into
view
,
on
the
very
trail
they
had
just
covered
,
trotted
a
furry
,
*NL*
slinking
form
.
Its
nose
was
to
the
trail
,
and
it
trotted
with
a
*NL*
peculiar
,
sliding
,
effortless
gait
.
When
they
halted
,
it
halted
,
*NL*
throwing
up
its
head
and
regarding
them
steadily
with
nostrils
that
*NL*
twitched
as
it
caught
and
studied
the
scent
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
she-wolf
,
''
Bill
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dogs
had
lain
down
in
the
snow
,
and
he
walked
past
them
to
join
his
*NL*
partner
in
the
sled
.
Together
they
watched
the
strange
animal
that
had
*NL*
pursued
them
for
days
and
that
had
already
accomplished
the
destruction
*NL*
of
half
their
dog-team
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
searching
scrutiny
,
the
animal
trotted
forward
a
few
steps
.
This
*NL*
it
repeated
several
times
,
till
it
was
a
short
hundred
yards
away
.
It
*NL*
paused
,
head
up
,
close
by
a
clump
of
spruce
trees
,
and
with
sight
and
*NL*
scent
studied
the
outfit
of
the
watching
men
.
It
looked
at
them
in
a
*NL*
strangely
wistful
way
,
after
the
manner
of
a
dog
;
but
in
its
wistfulness
*NL*
there
was
none
of
the
dog
affection
.
It
was
a
wistfulness
bred
of
*NL*
hunger
,
as
cruel
as
its
own
fangs
,
as
merciless
as
the
frost
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
large
for
a
wolf
,
its
gaunt
frame
advertising
the
lines
of
an
*NL*
animal
that
was
among
the
largest
of
its
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stands
pretty
close
to
two
feet
an
'
a
half
at
the
shoulders
,
''
Henry
*NL*
commented
.
``
An
'
I
'll
bet
it
ai
n't
far
from
five
feet
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kind
of
strange
colour
for
a
wolf
,
''
was
Bill
's
criticism
.
``
I
never
seen
*NL*
a
red
wolf
before
.
Looks
almost
cinnamon
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
animal
was
certainly
not
cinnamon-coloured
.
Its
coat
was
the
true
*NL*
wolf-coat
.
The
dominant
colour
was
grey
,
and
yet
there
was
to
it
a
faint
*NL*
reddish
hue
--
a
hue
that
was
baffling
,
that
appeared
and
disappeared
,
that
*NL*
was
more
like
an
illusion
of
the
vision
,
now
grey
,
distinctly
grey
,
and
*NL*
again
giving
hints
and
glints
of
a
vague
redness
of
colour
not
*NL*
classifiable
in
terms
of
ordinary
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
big
husky
sled-dog
,
''
Bill
said
.
``
I
*NL*
would
n't
be
s
`
prised
to
see
it
wag
its
tail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
you
husky
!
''
he
called
.
``
Come
here
,
you
whatever-your-name-is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
a
bit
scairt
of
you
,
''
Henry
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
waved
his
hand
at
it
threateningly
and
shouted
loudly
;
but
the
*NL*
animal
betrayed
no
fear
.
The
only
change
in
it
that
they
could
notice
*NL*
was
an
accession
of
alertness
.
It
still
regarded
them
with
the
merciless
*NL*
wistfulness
of
hunger
.
They
were
meat
,
and
it
was
hungry
;
and
it
would
*NL*
like
to
go
in
and
eat
them
if
it
dared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Henry
,
''
Bill
said
,
unconsciously
lowering
his
voice
to
a
*NL*
whisper
because
of
what
he
imitated
.
``
We
've
got
three
cartridges
.
But
*NL*
it
's
a
dead
shot
.
Could
n't
miss
it
.
It
's
got
away
with
three
of
our
*NL*
dogs
,
an
'
we
oughter
put
a
stop
to
it
.
What
d'ye
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
nodded
his
consent
.
Bill
cautiously
slipped
the
gun
from
under
the
*NL*
sled-lashing
.
The
gun
was
on
the
way
to
his
shoulder
,
but
it
never
got
*NL*
there
.
For
in
that
instant
the
she-wolf
leaped
sidewise
from
the
trail
*NL*
into
the
clump
of
spruce
trees
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
looked
at
each
other
.
Henry
whistled
long
and
*NL*
comprehendingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
have
knowed
it
,
''
Bill
chided
himself
aloud
as
he
replaced
the
*NL*
gun
.
``
Of
course
a
wolf
that
knows
enough
to
come
in
with
the
dogs
at
*NL*
feedin
'
time
,
'd
know
all
about
shooting-irons
.
I
tell
you
right
now
,
*NL*
Henry
,
that
critter
's
the
cause
of
all
our
trouble
.
We
'd
have
six
dogs
*NL*
at
the
present
time
,
`
stead
of
three
,
if
it
was
n't
for
her
.
An
'
I
tell
*NL*
you
right
now
,
Henry
,
I
'm
goin
'
to
get
her
.
She
's
too
smart
to
be
shot
*NL*
in
the
open
.
But
I
'm
goin
'
to
lay
for
her
.
I
'll
bushwhack
her
as
sure
*NL*
as
my
name
is
Bill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
stray
off
too
far
in
doin
'
it
,
''
his
partner
admonished
.
``
If
*NL*
that
pack
ever
starts
to
jump
you
,
them
three
cartridges
'd
be
wuth
no
*NL*
more
'n
three
whoops
in
hell
.
Them
animals
is
damn
hungry
,
an
'
once
they
*NL*
start
in
,
they
'll
sure
get
you
,
Bill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
camped
early
that
night
.
Three
dogs
could
not
drag
the
sled
so
fast
*NL*
nor
for
so
long
hours
as
could
six
,
and
they
were
showing
unmistakable
*NL*
signs
of
playing
out
.
And
the
men
went
early
to
bed
,
Bill
first
seeing
*NL*
to
it
that
the
dogs
were
tied
out
of
gnawing-reach
of
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
wolves
were
growing
bolder
,
and
the
men
were
aroused
more
than
*NL*
once
from
their
sleep
.
So
near
did
the
wolves
approach
,
that
the
dogs
*NL*
became
frantic
with
terror
,
and
it
was
necessary
to
replenish
the
fire
*NL*
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
keep
the
adventurous
marauders
at
safer
*NL*
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
hearn
sailors
talk
of
sharks
followin
'
a
ship
,
''
Bill
remarked
,
as
*NL*
he
crawled
back
into
the
blankets
after
one
such
replenishing
of
the
*NL*
fire
.
``
Well
,
them
wolves
is
land
sharks
.
They
know
their
business
*NL*
better
'n
we
do
,
an
'
they
ai
n't
a-holdin
'
our
trail
this
way
for
their
*NL*
health
.
They
're
goin
'
to
get
us
.
They
're
sure
goin
'
to
get
us
,
Henry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
half
got
you
a
`
ready
,
a-talkin
'
like
that
,
''
Henry
retorted
*NL*
sharply
.
``
A
man
's
half
licked
when
he
says
he
is
.
An
'
you
're
half
eaten
*NL*
from
the
way
you
're
goin

on
about
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
away
with
better
men
than
you
an
'
me

''
Bill
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shet
up
your
croakin
'
.
You
make
me
all-fired
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
rolled
over
angrily
on
his
side
,
but
was
surprised
that
Bill
made
*NL*
no
similar
display
of
temper
.
This
was
not
Bill
's
way
,
for
he
was
easily
*NL*
angered
by
sharp
words
.
Henry
thought
long
over
it
before
he
went
to
*NL*
sleep
,
and
as
his
eyelids
fluttered
down
and
he
dozed
off
,
the
thought
in
*NL*
his
mind
was
:
``
There
's
no
mistakin
'
it
,
Bill
's
almighty
blue
.
I
'll
have
*NL*
to
cheer
him
up
to-morrow
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
HUNGER
CRY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
began
auspiciously
.
They
had
lost
no
dogs
during
the
night
,
and
*NL*
they
swung
out
upon
the
trail
and
into
the
silence
,
the
darkness
,
and
the
*NL*
cold
with
spirits
that
were
fairly
light
.
Bill
seemed
to
have
forgotten
*NL*
his
forebodings
of
the
previous
night
,
and
even
waxed
facetious
with
the
*NL*
dogs
when
,
at
midday
,
they
overturned
the
sled
on
a
bad
piece
of
trail
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
awkward
mix-up
.
The
sled
was
upside
down
and
jammed
between
a
*NL*
tree-trunk
and
a
huge
rock
,
and
they
were
forced
to
unharness
the
dogs
in
*NL*
order
to
straighten
out
the
tangle
.
The
two
men
were
bent
over
the
sled
*NL*
and
trying
to
right
it
,
when
Henry
observed
One
Ear
sidling
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
you
,
One
Ear
!
''
he
cried
,
straightening
up
and
turning
around
on
*NL*
the
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
One
Ear
broke
into
a
run
across
the
snow
,
his
traces
trailing
behind
*NL*
him
.
And
there
,
out
in
the
snow
of
their
back
track
,
was
the
she-wolf
*NL*
waiting
for
him
.
As
he
neared
her
,
he
became
suddenly
cautious
.
He
*NL*
slowed
down
to
an
alert
and
mincing
walk
and
then
stopped
.
He
regarded
*NL*
her
carefully
and
dubiously
,
yet
desirefully
.
She
seemed
to
smile
at
*NL*
him
,
showing
her
teeth
in
an
ingratiating
rather
than
a
menacing
way
.
She
*NL*
moved
toward
him
a
few
steps
,
playfully
,
and
then
halted
.
One
Ear
drew
*NL*
near
to
her
,
still
alert
and
cautious
,
his
tail
and
ears
in
the
air
,
his
*NL*
head
held
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
sniff
noses
with
her
,
but
she
retreated
playfully
and
coyly
.
*NL*
Every
advance
on
his
part
was
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
retreat
on
*NL*
her
part
.
Step
by
step
she
was
luring
him
away
from
the
security
of
his
*NL*
human
companionship
.
Once
,
as
though
a
warning
had
in
vague
ways
flitted
*NL*
through
his
intelligence
,
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
back
at
the
*NL*
overturned
sled
,
at
his
team-mates
,
and
at
the
two
men
who
were
calling
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whatever
idea
was
forming
in
his
mind
,
was
dissipated
by
the
*NL*
she-wolf
,
who
advanced
upon
him
,
sniffed
noses
with
him
for
a
fleeting
*NL*
instant
,
and
then
resumed
her
coy
retreat
before
his
renewed
advances
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Bill
had
bethought
himself
of
the
rifle
.
But
it
was
*NL*
jammed
beneath
the
overturned
sled
,
and
by
the
time
Henry
had
helped
him
*NL*
to
right
the
load
,
One
Ear
and
the
she-wolf
were
too
close
together
and
*NL*
the
distance
too
great
to
risk
a
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Too
late
One
Ear
learned
his
mistake
.
Before
they
saw
the
cause
,
the
two
*NL*
men
saw
him
turn
and
start
to
run
back
toward
them
.
Then
,
approaching
at
*NL*
right
angles
to
the
trail
and
cutting
off
his
retreat
they
saw
a
dozen
*NL*
wolves
,
lean
and
grey
,
bounding
across
the
snow
.
On
the
instant
,
the
she
-
*NL*
wolf
's
coyness
and
playfulness
disappeared
.
With
a
snarl
she
sprang
upon
*NL*
One
Ear
.
He
thrust
her
off
with
his
shoulder
,
and
,
his
retreat
cut
off
*NL*
and
still
intent
on
regaining
the
sled
,
he
altered
his
course
in
an
*NL*
attempt
to
circle
around
to
it
.
More
wolves
were
appearing
every
moment
*NL*
and
joining
in
the
chase
.
The
she-wolf
was
one
leap
behind
One
Ear
and
*NL*
holding
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
goin
'
?
''
Henry
suddenly
demanded
,
laying
his
hand
on
his
*NL*
partner
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
shook
it
off
.
``
I
wo
n't
stand
it
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
ai
n't
a-goin
'
to
*NL*
get
any
more
of
our
dogs
if
I
can
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gun
in
hand
,
he
plunged
into
the
underbrush
that
lined
the
side
of
the
*NL*
trail
.
His
intention
was
apparent
enough
.
Taking
the
sled
as
the
centre
*NL*
of
the
circle
that
One
Ear
was
making
,
Bill
planned
to
tap
that
circle
at
*NL*
a
point
in
advance
of
the
pursuit
.
With
his
rifle
,
in
the
broad
*NL*
daylight
,
it
might
be
possible
for
him
to
awe
the
wolves
and
save
the
*NL*
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Bill
!
''
Henry
called
after
him
.
``
Be
careful
!
Do
n't
take
no
*NL*
chances
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
sat
down
on
the
sled
and
watched
.
There
was
nothing
else
for
him
*NL*
to
do
.
Bill
had
already
gone
from
sight
;
but
now
and
again
,
appearing
*NL*
and
disappearing
amongst
the
underbrush
and
the
scattered
clumps
of
*NL*
spruce
,
could
be
seen
One
Ear
.
Henry
judged
his
case
to
be
hopeless
.
The
*NL*
dog
was
thoroughly
alive
to
its
danger
,
but
it
was
running
on
the
outer
*NL*
circle
while
the
wolf-pack
was
running
on
the
inner
and
shorter
circle
.
*NL*
It
was
vain
to
think
of
One
Ear
so
outdistancing
his
pursuers
as
to
be
*NL*
able
to
cut
across
their
circle
in
advance
of
them
and
to
regain
the
*NL*
sled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
different
lines
were
rapidly
approaching
a
point
.
Somewhere
out
*NL*
there
in
the
snow
,
screened
from
his
sight
by
trees
and
thickets
,
Henry
*NL*
knew
that
the
wolf-pack
,
One
Ear
,
and
Bill
were
coming
together
.
All
too
*NL*
quickly
,
far
more
quickly
than
he
had
expected
,
it
happened
.
He
heard
a
*NL*
shot
,
then
two
shots
,
in
rapid
succession
,
and
he
knew
that
Bill
's
*NL*
ammunition
was
gone
.
Then
he
heard
a
great
outcry
of
snarls
and
yelps
.
*NL*
He
recognised
One
Ear
's
yell
of
pain
and
terror
,
and
he
heard
a
wolf-cry
*NL*
that
bespoke
a
stricken
animal
.
And
that
was
all
.
The
snarls
ceased
.
*NL*
The
yelping
died
away
.
Silence
settled
down
again
over
the
lonely
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
for
a
long
while
upon
the
sled
.
There
was
no
need
for
him
to
go
*NL*
and
see
what
had
happened
.
He
knew
it
as
though
it
had
taken
place
*NL*
before
his
eyes
.
Once
,
he
roused
with
a
start
and
hastily
got
the
axe
*NL*
out
from
underneath
the
lashings
.
But
for
some
time
longer
he
sat
and
*NL*
brooded
,
the
two
remaining
dogs
crouching
and
trembling
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
arose
in
a
weary
manner
,
as
though
all
the
resilience
had
gone
*NL*
out
of
his
body
,
and
proceeded
to
fasten
the
dogs
to
the
sled
.
He
passed
*NL*
a
rope
over
his
shoulder
,
a
man-trace
,
and
pulled
with
the
dogs
.
He
did
*NL*
not
go
far
.
At
the
first
hint
of
darkness
he
hastened
to
make
a
camp
,
*NL*
and
he
saw
to
it
that
he
had
a
generous
supply
of
firewood
.
He
fed
the
*NL*
dogs
,
cooked
and
ate
his
supper
,
and
made
his
bed
close
to
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
not
destined
to
enjoy
that
bed
.
Before
his
eyes
closed
the
*NL*
wolves
had
drawn
too
near
for
safety
.
It
no
longer
required
an
effort
of
*NL*
the
vision
to
see
them
.
They
were
all
about
him
and
the
fire
,
in
a
*NL*
narrow
circle
,
and
he
could
see
them
plainly
in
the
firelight
lying
down
,
*NL*
sitting
up
,
crawling
forward
on
their
bellies
,
or
slinking
back
and
*NL*
forth
.
They
even
slept
.
Here
and
there
he
could
see
one
curled
up
in
*NL*
the
snow
like
a
dog
,
taking
the
sleep
that
was
now
denied
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
the
fire
brightly
blazing
,
for
he
knew
that
it
alone
intervened
*NL*
between
the
flesh
of
his
body
and
their
hungry
fangs
.
His
two
dogs
*NL*
stayed
close
by
him
,
one
on
either
side
,
leaning
against
him
for
*NL*
protection
,
crying
and
whimpering
,
and
at
times
snarling
desperately
when
*NL*
a
wolf
approached
a
little
closer
than
usual
.
At
such
moments
,
when
his
*NL*
dogs
snarled
,
the
whole
circle
would
be
agitated
,
the
wolves
coming
to
*NL*
their
feet
and
pressing
tentatively
forward
,
a
chorus
of
snarls
and
eager
*NL*
yelps
rising
about
him
.
Then
the
circle
would
lie
down
again
,
and
here
*NL*
and
there
a
wolf
would
resume
its
broken
nap
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
circle
had
a
continuous
tendency
to
draw
in
upon
him
.
Bit
by
*NL*
bit
,
an
inch
at
a
time
,
with
here
a
wolf
bellying
forward
,
and
there
a
*NL*
wolf
bellying
forward
,
the
circle
would
narrow
until
the
brutes
were
*NL*
almost
within
springing
distance
.
Then
he
would
seize
brands
from
the
*NL*
fire
and
hurl
them
into
the
pack
.
A
hasty
drawing
back
always
resulted
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
angry
yelps
and
frightened
snarls
when
a
well-aimed
brand
*NL*
struck
and
scorched
a
too
daring
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
found
the
man
haggard
and
worn
,
wide-eyed
from
want
of
sleep
.
He
*NL*
cooked
breakfast
in
the
darkness
,
and
at
nine
o'clock
,
when
,
with
the
*NL*
coming
of
daylight
,
the
wolf-pack
drew
back
,
he
set
about
the
task
he
had
*NL*
planned
through
the
long
hours
of
the
night
.
Chopping
down
young
*NL*
saplings
,
he
made
them
cross-bars
of
a
scaffold
by
lashing
them
high
up
*NL*
to
the
trunks
of
standing
trees
.
Using
the
sled-lashing
for
a
heaving
*NL*
rope
,
and
with
the
aid
of
the
dogs
,
he
hoisted
the
coffin
to
the
top
of
*NL*
the
scaffold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
got
Bill
,
an
'
they
may
get
me
,
but
they
'll
sure
never
get
you
,
*NL*
young
man
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
the
dead
body
in
its
tree-sepulchre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
took
the
trail
,
the
lightened
sled
bounding
along
behind
the
*NL*
willing
dogs
;
for
they
,
too
,
knew
that
safety
lay
open
in
the
gaining
of
*NL*
Fort
McGurry
.
The
wolves
were
now
more
open
in
their
pursuit
,
trotting
*NL*
sedately
behind
and
ranging
along
on
either
side
,
their
red
tongues
*NL*
lolling
out
,
their
lean
sides
showing
the
undulating
ribs
with
every
*NL*
movement
.
They
were
very
lean
,
mere
skin-bags
stretched
over
bony
*NL*
frames
,
with
strings
for
muscles
--
so
lean
that
Henry
found
it
in
his
mind
*NL*
to
marvel
that
they
still
kept
their
feet
and
did
not
collapse
forthright
*NL*
in
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
dare
travel
until
dark
.
At
midday
,
not
only
did
the
sun
warm
*NL*
the
southern
horizon
,
but
it
even
thrust
its
upper
rim
,
pale
and
golden
,
*NL*
above
the
sky-line
.
He
received
it
as
a
sign
.
The
days
were
growing
*NL*
longer
.
The
sun
was
returning
.
But
scarcely
had
the
cheer
of
its
light
*NL*
departed
,
than
he
went
into
camp
.
There
were
still
several
hours
of
grey
*NL*
daylight
and
sombre
twilight
,
and
he
utilised
them
in
chopping
an
*NL*
enormous
supply
of
fire-wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
night
came
horror
.
Not
only
were
the
starving
wolves
growing
*NL*
bolder
,
but
lack
of
sleep
was
telling
upon
Henry
.
He
dozed
despite
*NL*
himself
,
crouching
by
the
fire
,
the
blankets
about
his
shoulders
,
the
axe
*NL*
between
his
knees
,
and
on
either
side
a
dog
pressing
close
against
him
.
*NL*
He
awoke
once
and
saw
in
front
of
him
,
not
a
dozen
feet
away
,
a
big
grey
*NL*
wolf
,
one
of
the
largest
of
the
pack
.
And
even
as
he
looked
,
the
brute
*NL*
deliberately
stretched
himself
after
the
manner
of
a
lazy
dog
,
yawning
*NL*
full
in
his
face
and
looking
upon
him
with
a
possessive
eye
,
as
if
,
in
*NL*
truth
,
he
were
merely
a
delayed
meal
that
was
soon
to
be
eaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
certitude
was
shown
by
the
whole
pack
.
Fully
a
score
he
could
*NL*
count
,
staring
hungrily
at
him
or
calmly
sleeping
in
the
snow
.
They
*NL*
reminded
him
of
children
gathered
about
a
spread
table
and
awaiting
*NL*
permission
to
begin
to
eat
.
And
he
was
the
food
they
were
to
eat
!
He
*NL*
wondered
how
and
when
the
meal
would
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
piled
wood
on
the
fire
he
discovered
an
appreciation
of
his
own
*NL*
body
which
he
had
never
felt
before
.
He
watched
his
moving
muscles
and
*NL*
was
interested
in
the
cunning
mechanism
of
his
fingers
.
By
the
light
of
*NL*
the
fire
he
crooked
his
fingers
slowly
and
repeatedly
now
one
at
a
time
,
*NL*
now
all
together
,
spreading
them
wide
or
making
quick
gripping
movements
.
*NL*
He
studied
the
nail-formation
,
and
prodded
the
finger-tips
,
now
sharply
,
*NL*
and
again
softly
,
gauging
the
while
the
nerve-sensations
produced
.
It
*NL*
fascinated
him
,
and
he
grew
suddenly
fond
of
this
subtle
flesh
of
his
*NL*
that
worked
so
beautifully
and
smoothly
and
delicately
.
Then
he
would
*NL*
cast
a
glance
of
fear
at
the
wolf-circle
drawn
expectantly
about
him
,
and
*NL*
like
a
blow
the
realisation
would
strike
him
that
this
wonderful
body
of
*NL*
his
,
this
living
flesh
,
was
no
more
than
so
much
meat
,
a
quest
of
*NL*
ravenous
animals
,
to
be
torn
and
slashed
by
their
hungry
fangs
,
to
be
*NL*
sustenance
to
them
as
the
moose
and
the
rabbit
had
often
been
sustenance
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
out
of
a
doze
that
was
half
nightmare
,
to
see
the
red-hued
she
-
*NL*
wolf
before
him
.
She
was
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
feet
away
sitting
in
*NL*
the
snow
and
wistfully
regarding
him
.
The
two
dogs
were
whimpering
and
*NL*
snarling
at
his
feet
,
but
she
took
no
notice
of
them
.
She
was
looking
at
*NL*
the
man
,
and
for
some
time
he
returned
her
look
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
threatening
about
her
.
She
looked
at
him
merely
with
a
great
*NL*
wistfulness
,
but
he
knew
it
to
be
the
wistfulness
of
an
equally
great
*NL*
hunger
.
He
was
the
food
,
and
the
sight
of
him
excited
in
her
the
*NL*
gustatory
sensations
.
Her
mouth
opened
,
the
saliva
drooled
forth
,
and
*NL*
she
licked
her
chops
with
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
spasm
of
fear
went
through
him
.
He
reached
hastily
for
a
brand
to
*NL*
throw
at
her
.
But
even
as
he
reached
,
and
before
his
fingers
had
closed
*NL*
on
the
missile
,
she
sprang
back
into
safety
;
and
he
knew
that
she
was
*NL*
used
to
having
things
thrown
at
her
.
She
had
snarled
as
she
sprang
away
,
*NL*
baring
her
white
fangs
to
their
roots
,
all
her
wistfulness
vanishing
,
*NL*
being
replaced
by
a
carnivorous
malignity
that
made
him
shudder
.
He
*NL*
glanced
at
the
hand
that
held
the
brand
,
noticing
the
cunning
delicacy
of
*NL*
the
fingers
that
gripped
it
,
how
they
adjusted
themselves
to
all
the
*NL*
inequalities
of
the
surface
,
curling
over
and
under
and
about
the
rough
*NL*
wood
,
and
one
little
finger
,
too
close
to
the
burning
portion
of
the
*NL*
brand
,
sensitively
and
automatically
writhing
back
from
the
hurtful
heat
*NL*
to
a
cooler
gripping-place
;
and
in
the
same
instant
he
seemed
to
see
a
*NL*
vision
of
those
same
sensitive
and
delicate
fingers
being
crushed
and
*NL*
torn
by
the
white
teeth
of
the
she-wolf
.
Never
had
he
been
so
fond
of
*NL*
this
body
of
his
as
now
when
his
tenure
of
it
was
so
precarious
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
night
,
with
burning
brands
,
he
fought
off
the
hungry
pack
.
When
he
*NL*
dozed
despite
himself
,
the
whimpering
and
snarling
of
the
dogs
aroused
*NL*
him
.
Morning
came
,
but
for
the
first
time
the
light
of
day
failed
to
*NL*
scatter
the
wolves
.
The
man
waited
in
vain
for
them
to
go
.
They
*NL*
remained
in
a
circle
about
him
and
his
fire
,
displaying
an
arrogance
of
*NL*
possession
that
shook
his
courage
born
of
the
morning
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
one
desperate
attempt
to
pull
out
on
the
trail
.
But
the
moment
*NL*
he
left
the
protection
of
the
fire
,
the
boldest
wolf
leaped
for
him
,
but
*NL*
leaped
short
.
He
saved
himself
by
springing
back
,
the
jaws
snapping
*NL*
together
a
scant
six
inches
from
his
thigh
.
The
rest
of
the
pack
was
now
*NL*
up
and
surging
upon
him
,
and
a
throwing
of
firebrands
right
and
left
was
*NL*
necessary
to
drive
them
back
to
a
respectful
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
in
the
daylight
he
did
not
dare
leave
the
fire
to
chop
fresh
wood
.
*NL*
Twenty
feet
away
towered
a
huge
dead
spruce
.
He
spent
half
the
day
*NL*
extending
his
campfire
to
the
tree
,
at
any
moment
a
half
dozen
burning
*NL*
faggots
ready
at
hand
to
fling
at
his
enemies
.
Once
at
the
tree
,
he
*NL*
studied
the
surrounding
forest
in
order
to
fell
the
tree
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
the
most
firewood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
a
repetition
of
the
night
before
,
save
that
the
need
for
*NL*
sleep
was
becoming
overpowering
.
The
snarling
of
his
dogs
was
losing
its
*NL*
efficacy
.
Besides
,
they
were
snarling
all
the
time
,
and
his
benumbed
and
*NL*
drowsy
senses
no
longer
took
note
of
changing
pitch
and
intensity
.
He
*NL*
awoke
with
a
start
.
The
she-wolf
was
less
than
a
yard
from
him
.
*NL*
Mechanically
,
at
short
range
,
without
letting
go
of
it
,
he
thrust
a
brand
*NL*
full
into
her
open
and
snarling
mouth
.
She
sprang
away
,
yelling
with
*NL*
pain
,
and
while
he
took
delight
in
the
smell
of
burning
flesh
and
hair
,
*NL*
he
watched
her
shaking
her
head
and
growling
wrathfully
a
score
of
feet
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
,
before
he
dozed
again
,
he
tied
a
burning
pine-knot
to
his
*NL*
right
hand
.
His
eyes
were
closed
but
few
minutes
when
the
burn
of
the
*NL*
flame
on
his
flesh
awakened
him
.
For
several
hours
he
adhered
to
this
*NL*
programme
.
Every
time
he
was
thus
awakened
he
drove
back
the
wolves
with
*NL*
flying
brands
,
replenished
the
fire
,
and
rearranged
the
pine-knot
on
his
*NL*
hand
.
All
worked
well
,
but
there
came
a
time
when
he
fastened
the
pine
-
*NL*
knot
insecurely
.
As
his
eyes
closed
it
fell
away
from
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dreamed
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
Fort
McGurry
.
It
was
warm
*NL*
and
comfortable
,
and
he
was
playing
cribbage
with
the
Factor
.
Also
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
the
fort
was
besieged
by
wolves
.
They
were
howling
at
*NL*
the
very
gates
,
and
sometimes
he
and
the
Factor
paused
from
the
game
to
*NL*
listen
and
laugh
at
the
futile
efforts
of
the
wolves
to
get
in
.
And
*NL*
then
,
so
strange
was
the
dream
,
there
was
a
crash
.
The
door
was
burst
*NL*
open
.
He
could
see
the
wolves
flooding
into
the
big
living-room
of
the
*NL*
fort
.
They
were
leaping
straight
for
him
and
the
Factor
.
With
the
*NL*
bursting
open
of
the
door
,
the
noise
of
their
howling
had
increased
*NL*
tremendously
.
This
howling
now
bothered
him
.
His
dream
was
merging
into
*NL*
something
else
--
he
knew
not
what
;
but
through
it
all
,
following
him
,
*NL*
persisted
the
howling
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
awoke
to
find
the
howling
real
.
There
was
a
great
snarling
*NL*
and
yelping
.
The
wolves
were
rushing
him
.
They
were
all
about
him
and
*NL*
upon
him
.
The
teeth
of
one
had
closed
upon
his
arm
.
Instinctively
he
*NL*
leaped
into
the
fire
,
and
as
he
leaped
,
he
felt
the
sharp
slash
of
teeth
*NL*
that
tore
through
the
flesh
of
his
leg
.
Then
began
a
fire
fight
.
His
*NL*
stout
mittens
temporarily
protected
his
hands
,
and
he
scooped
live
coals
*NL*
into
the
air
in
all
directions
,
until
the
campfire
took
on
the
semblance
*NL*
of
a
volcano
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
could
not
last
long
.
His
face
was
blistering
in
the
heat
,
his
*NL*
eyebrows
and
lashes
were
singed
off
,
and
the
heat
was
becoming
unbearable
*NL*
to
his
feet
.
With
a
flaming
brand
in
each
hand
,
he
sprang
to
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
fire
.
The
wolves
had
been
driven
back
.
On
every
side
,
wherever
the
*NL*
live
coals
had
fallen
,
the
snow
was
sizzling
,
and
every
little
while
a
*NL*
retiring
wolf
,
with
wild
leap
and
snort
and
snarl
,
announced
that
one
*NL*
such
live
coal
had
been
stepped
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Flinging
his
brands
at
the
nearest
of
his
enemies
,
the
man
thrust
his
*NL*
smouldering
mittens
into
the
snow
and
stamped
about
to
cool
his
feet
.
His
*NL*
two
dogs
were
missing
,
and
he
well
knew
that
they
had
served
as
a
course
*NL*
in
the
protracted
meal
which
had
begun
days
before
with
Fatty
,
the
last
*NL*
course
of
which
would
likely
be
himself
in
the
days
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ai
n't
got
me
yet
!
''
he
cried
,
savagely
shaking
his
fist
at
the
hungry
*NL*
beasts
;
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
whole
circle
was
agitated
,
*NL*
there
was
a
general
snarl
,
and
the
she-wolf
slid
up
close
to
him
across
*NL*
the
snow
and
watched
him
with
hungry
wistfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
to
work
to
carry
out
a
new
idea
that
had
come
to
him
.
He
extended
*NL*
the
fire
into
a
large
circle
.
Inside
this
circle
he
crouched
,
his
*NL*
sleeping
outfit
under
him
as
a
protection
against
the
melting
snow
.
When
*NL*
he
had
thus
disappeared
within
his
shelter
of
flame
,
the
whole
pack
came
*NL*
curiously
to
the
rim
of
the
fire
to
see
what
had
become
of
him
.
Hitherto
*NL*
they
had
been
denied
access
to
the
fire
,
and
they
now
settled
down
in
a
*NL*
close-drawn
circle
,
like
so
many
dogs
,
blinking
and
yawning
and
*NL*
stretching
their
lean
bodies
in
the
unaccustomed
warmth
.
Then
the
she
-
*NL*
wolf
sat
down
,
pointed
her
nose
at
a
star
,
and
began
to
howl
.
One
by
one
*NL*
the
wolves
joined
her
,
till
the
whole
pack
,
on
haunches
,
with
noses
*NL*
pointed
skyward
,
was
howling
its
hunger
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawn
came
,
and
daylight
.
The
fire
was
burning
low
.
The
fuel
had
run
*NL*
out
,
and
there
was
need
to
get
more
.
The
man
attempted
to
step
out
of
*NL*
his
circle
of
flame
,
but
the
wolves
surged
to
meet
him
.
Burning
brands
*NL*
made
them
spring
aside
,
but
they
no
longer
sprang
back
.
In
vain
he
*NL*
strove
to
drive
them
back
.
As
he
gave
up
and
stumbled
inside
his
circle
,
*NL*
a
wolf
leaped
for
him
,
missed
,
and
landed
with
all
four
feet
in
the
*NL*
coals
.
It
cried
out
with
terror
,
at
the
same
time
snarling
,
and
*NL*
scrambled
back
to
cool
its
paws
in
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
sat
down
on
his
blankets
in
a
crouching
position
.
His
body
*NL*
leaned
forward
from
the
hips
.
His
shoulders
,
relaxed
and
drooping
,
and
*NL*
his
head
on
his
knees
advertised
that
he
had
given
up
the
struggle
.
Now
*NL*
and
again
he
raised
his
head
to
note
the
dying
down
of
the
fire
.
The
*NL*
circle
of
flame
and
coals
was
breaking
into
segments
with
openings
in
*NL*
between
.
These
openings
grew
in
size
,
the
segments
diminished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
can
come
an
'
get
me
any
time
,
''
he
mumbled
.
``
Anyway
,
I
'm
*NL*
goin
'
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
awakened
,
and
in
an
opening
in
the
circle
,
directly
in
front
of
*NL*
him
,
he
saw
the
she-wolf
gazing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
awakened
,
a
little
later
,
though
it
seemed
hours
to
him
.
A
*NL*
mysterious
change
had
taken
place
--
so
mysterious
a
change
that
he
was
*NL*
shocked
wider
awake
.
Something
had
happened
.
He
could
not
understand
at
*NL*
first
.
Then
he
discovered
it
.
The
wolves
were
gone
.
Remained
only
the
*NL*
trampled
snow
to
show
how
closely
they
had
pressed
him
.
Sleep
was
*NL*
welling
up
and
gripping
him
again
,
his
head
was
sinking
down
upon
his
*NL*
knees
,
when
he
roused
with
a
sudden
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
cries
of
men
,
and
churn
of
sleds
,
the
creaking
of
harnesses
,
*NL*
and
the
eager
whimpering
of
straining
dogs
.
Four
sleds
pulled
in
from
*NL*
the
river
bed
to
the
camp
among
the
trees
.
Half
a
dozen
men
were
about
*NL*
the
man
who
crouched
in
the
centre
of
the
dying
fire
.
They
were
shaking
*NL*
and
prodding
him
into
consciousness
.
He
looked
at
them
like
a
drunken
*NL*
man
and
maundered
in
strange
,
sleepy
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Red
she-wolf
...
Come
in
with
the
dogs
at
feedin
'
time
...
First
*NL*
she
ate
the
dog-food
...
Then
she
ate
the
dogs
...
An

after
that
*NL*
she
ate
Bill
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
Lord
Alfred
?
''
one
of
the
men
bellowed
in
his
ear
,
shaking
him
*NL*
roughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
slowly
.
``
No
,
she
did
n't
eat
him
...
He
's
roostin
'
*NL*
in
a
tree
at
the
last
camp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
?
''
the
man
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
in
a
box
,
''
Henry
answered
.
He
jerked
his
shoulder
petulantly
away
*NL*
from
the
grip
of
his
questioner
.
``
Say
,
you
lem
me
alone
...
I
'm
jes
'
*NL*
plump
tuckered
out
...
Goo
'
night
,
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
fluttered
and
went
shut
.
His
chin
fell
forward
on
his
chest
.
*NL*
And
even
as
they
eased
him
down
upon
the
blankets
his
snores
were
rising
*NL*
on
the
frosty
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
another
sound
.
Far
and
faint
it
was
,
in
the
remote
*NL*
distance
,
the
cry
of
the
hungry
wolf-pack
as
it
took
the
trail
of
other
*NL*
meat
than
the
man
it
had
just
missed
.

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
BATTLE
OF
THE
FANGS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
she-wolf
who
had
first
caught
the
sound
of
men
's
voices
and
*NL*
the
whining
of
the
sled-dogs
;
and
it
was
the
she-wolf
who
was
first
to
*NL*
spring
away
from
the
cornered
man
in
his
circle
of
dying
flame
.
The
pack
*NL*
had
been
loath
to
forego
the
kill
it
had
hunted
down
,
and
it
lingered
for
*NL*
several
minutes
,
making
sure
of
the
sounds
,
and
then
it
,
too
,
sprang
away
*NL*
on
the
trail
made
by
the
she-wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Running
at
the
forefront
of
the
pack
was
a
large
grey
wolf
--
one
of
its
*NL*
several
leaders
.
It
was
he
who
directed
the
pack
's
course
on
the
heels
*NL*
of
the
she-wolf
.
It
was
he
who
snarled
warningly
at
the
younger
members
*NL*
of
the
pack
or
slashed
at
them
with
his
fangs
when
they
ambitiously
tried
*NL*
to
pass
him
.
And
it
was
he
who
increased
the
pace
when
he
sighted
the
*NL*
she-wolf
,
now
trotting
slowly
across
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
in
alongside
by
him
,
as
though
it
were
her
appointed
*NL*
position
,
and
took
the
pace
of
the
pack
.
He
did
not
snarl
at
her
,
nor
*NL*
show
his
teeth
,
when
any
leap
of
hers
chanced
to
put
her
in
advance
of
*NL*
him
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
seemed
kindly
disposed
toward
her
--
too
kindly
*NL*
to
suit
her
,
for
he
was
prone
to
run
near
to
her
,
and
when
he
ran
too
*NL*
near
it
was
she
who
snarled
and
showed
her
teeth
.
Nor
was
she
above
*NL*
slashing
his
shoulder
sharply
on
occasion
.
At
such
times
he
betrayed
no
*NL*
anger
.
He
merely
sprang
to
the
side
and
ran
stiffly
ahead
for
several
*NL*
awkward
leaps
,
in
carriage
and
conduct
resembling
an
abashed
country
*NL*
swain
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
his
one
trouble
in
the
running
of
the
pack
;
but
she
had
other
*NL*
troubles
.
On
her
other
side
ran
a
gaunt
old
wolf
,
grizzled
and
marked
*NL*
with
the
scars
of
many
battles
.
He
ran
always
on
her
right
side
.
The
*NL*
fact
that
he
had
but
one
eye
,
and
that
the
left
eye
,
might
account
for
*NL*
this
.
He
,
also
,
was
addicted
to
crowding
her
,
to
veering
toward
her
till
*NL*
his
scarred
muzzle
touched
her
body
,
or
shoulder
,
or
neck
.
As
with
the
*NL*
running
mate
on
the
left
,
she
repelled
these
attentions
with
her
teeth
;
*NL*
but
when
both
bestowed
their
attentions
at
the
same
time
she
was
roughly
*NL*
jostled
,
being
compelled
,
with
quick
snaps
to
either
side
,
to
drive
both
*NL*
lovers
away
and
at
the
same
time
to
maintain
her
forward
leap
with
the
*NL*
pack
and
see
the
way
of
her
feet
before
her
.
At
such
times
her
running
*NL*
mates
flashed
their
teeth
and
growled
threateningly
across
at
each
other
.
*NL*
They
might
have
fought
,
but
even
wooing
and
its
rivalry
waited
upon
the
*NL*
more
pressing
hunger-need
of
the
pack
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
each
repulse
,
when
the
old
wolf
sheered
abruptly
away
from
the
*NL*
sharp-toothed
object
of
his
desire
,
he
shouldered
against
a
young
three
-
*NL*
year-old
that
ran
on
his
blind
right
side
.
This
young
wolf
had
attained
*NL*
his
full
size
;
and
,
considering
the
weak
and
famished
condition
of
the
*NL*
pack
,
he
possessed
more
than
the
average
vigour
and
spirit
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
he
ran
with
his
head
even
with
the
shoulder
of
his
one-eyed
elder
.
When
*NL*
he
ventured
to
run
abreast
of
the
older
wolf
-LRB-
which
was
seldom
-RRB-
,
a
snarl
*NL*
and
a
snap
sent
him
back
even
with
the
shoulder
again
.
Sometimes
,
*NL*
however
,
he
dropped
cautiously
and
slowly
behind
and
edged
in
between
the
*NL*
old
leader
and
the
she-wolf
.
This
was
doubly
resented
,
even
triply
*NL*
resented
.
When
she
snarled
her
displeasure
,
the
old
leader
would
whirl
*NL*
on
the
three-year-old
.
Sometimes
she
whirled
with
him
.
And
sometimes
*NL*
the
young
leader
on
the
left
whirled
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
such
times
,
confronted
by
three
sets
of
savage
teeth
,
the
young
wolf
*NL*
stopped
precipitately
,
throwing
himself
back
on
his
haunches
,
with
fore
-
*NL*
legs
stiff
,
mouth
menacing
,
and
mane
bristling
.
This
confusion
in
the
*NL*
front
of
the
moving
pack
always
caused
confusion
in
the
rear
.
The
wolves
*NL*
behind
collided
with
the
young
wolf
and
expressed
their
displeasure
by
*NL*
administering
sharp
nips
on
his
hind-legs
and
flanks
.
He
was
laying
up
*NL*
trouble
for
himself
,
for
lack
of
food
and
short
tempers
went
together
;
*NL*
but
with
the
boundless
faith
of
youth
he
persisted
in
repeating
the
*NL*
manoeuvre
every
little
while
,
though
it
never
succeeded
in
gaining
*NL*
anything
for
him
but
discomfiture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
there
been
food
,
love-making
and
fighting
would
have
gone
on
apace
,
*NL*
and
the
pack-formation
would
have
been
broken
up
.
But
the
situation
of
*NL*
the
pack
was
desperate
.
It
was
lean
with
long-standing
hunger
.
It
ran
*NL*
below
its
ordinary
speed
.
At
the
rear
limped
the
weak
members
,
the
very
*NL*
young
and
the
very
old
.
At
the
front
were
the
strongest
.
Yet
all
were
*NL*
more
like
skeletons
than
full-bodied
wolves
.
Nevertheless
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
the
ones
that
limped
,
the
movements
of
the
animals
were
*NL*
effortless
and
tireless
.
Their
stringy
muscles
seemed
founts
of
*NL*
inexhaustible
energy
.
Behind
every
steel-like
contraction
of
a
muscle
,
*NL*
lay
another
steel-like
contraction
,
and
another
,
and
another
,
apparently
*NL*
without
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ran
many
miles
that
day
.
They
ran
through
the
night
.
And
the
next
*NL*
day
found
them
still
running
.
They
were
running
over
the
surface
of
a
*NL*
world
frozen
and
dead
.
No
life
stirred
.
They
alone
moved
through
the
*NL*
vast
inertness
.
They
alone
were
alive
,
and
they
sought
for
other
things
*NL*
that
were
alive
in
order
that
they
might
devour
them
and
continue
to
*NL*
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
low
divides
and
ranged
a
dozen
small
streams
in
a
*NL*
lower-lying
country
before
their
quest
was
rewarded
.
Then
they
came
upon
*NL*
moose
.
It
was
a
big
bull
they
first
found
.
Here
was
meat
and
life
,
and
*NL*
it
was
guarded
by
no
mysterious
fires
nor
flying
missiles
of
flame
.
Splay
*NL*
hoofs
and
palmated
antlers
they
knew
,
and
they
flung
their
customary
*NL*
patience
and
caution
to
the
wind
.
It
was
a
brief
fight
and
fierce
.
The
*NL*
big
bull
was
beset
on
every
side
.
He
ripped
them
open
or
split
their
*NL*
skulls
with
shrewdly
driven
blows
of
his
great
hoofs
.
He
crushed
them
*NL*
and
broke
them
on
his
large
horns
.
He
stamped
them
into
the
snow
under
*NL*
him
in
the
wallowing
struggle
.
But
he
was
foredoomed
,
and
he
went
down
*NL*
with
the
she-wolf
tearing
savagely
at
his
throat
,
and
with
other
teeth
*NL*
fixed
everywhere
upon
him
,
devouring
him
alive
,
before
ever
his
last
*NL*
struggles
ceased
or
his
last
damage
had
been
wrought
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
food
in
plenty
.
The
bull
weighed
over
eight
hundred
*NL*
pounds
--
fully
twenty
pounds
of
meat
per
mouth
for
the
forty-odd
wolves
of
*NL*
the
pack
.
But
if
they
could
fast
prodigiously
,
they
could
feed
*NL*
prodigiously
,
and
soon
a
few
scattered
bones
were
all
that
remained
of
*NL*
the
splendid
live
brute
that
had
faced
the
pack
a
few
hours
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
now
much
resting
and
sleeping
.
With
full
stomachs
,
bickering
*NL*
and
quarrelling
began
among
the
younger
males
,
and
this
continued
through
*NL*
the
few
days
that
followed
before
the
breaking-up
of
the
pack
.
The
*NL*
famine
was
over
.
The
wolves
were
now
in
the
country
of
game
,
and
though
*NL*
they
still
hunted
in
pack
,
they
hunted
more
cautiously
,
cutting
out
heavy
*NL*
cows
or
crippled
old
bulls
from
the
small
moose-herds
they
ran
across
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
day
,
in
this
land
of
plenty
,
when
the
wolf-pack
split
in
*NL*
half
and
went
in
different
directions
.
The
she-wolf
,
the
young
leader
on
*NL*
her
left
,
and
the
one-eyed
elder
on
her
right
,
led
their
half
of
the
pack
*NL*
down
to
the
Mackenzie
River
and
across
into
the
lake
country
to
the
east
.
*NL*
Each
day
this
remnant
of
the
pack
dwindled
.
Two
by
two
,
male
and
female
,
*NL*
the
wolves
were
deserting
.
Occasionally
a
solitary
male
was
driven
out
*NL*
by
the
sharp
teeth
of
his
rivals
.
In
the
end
there
remained
only
four
:
*NL*
the
she-wolf
,
the
young
leader
,
the
one-eyed
one
,
and
the
ambitious
three
-
*NL*
year-old
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
she-wolf
had
by
now
developed
a
ferocious
temper
.
Her
three
suitors
*NL*
all
bore
the
marks
of
her
teeth
.
Yet
they
never
replied
in
kind
,
never
*NL*
defended
themselves
against
her
.
They
turned
their
shoulders
to
her
most
*NL*
savage
slashes
,
and
with
wagging
tails
and
mincing
steps
strove
to
*NL*
placate
her
wrath
.
But
if
they
were
all
mildness
toward
her
,
they
were
*NL*
all
fierceness
toward
one
another
.
The
three-year-old
grew
too
ambitious
*NL*
in
his
fierceness
.
He
caught
the
one-eyed
elder
on
his
blind
side
and
*NL*
ripped
his
ear
into
ribbons
.
Though
the
grizzled
old
fellow
could
see
*NL*
only
on
one
side
,
against
the
youth
and
vigour
of
the
other
he
brought
*NL*
into
play
the
wisdom
of
long
years
of
experience
.
His
lost
eye
and
his
*NL*
scarred
muzzle
bore
evidence
to
the
nature
of
his
experience
.
He
had
*NL*
survived
too
many
battles
to
be
in
doubt
for
a
moment
about
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
began
fairly
,
but
it
did
not
end
fairly
.
There
was
no
telling
*NL*
what
the
outcome
would
have
been
,
for
the
third
wolf
joined
the
elder
,
*NL*
and
together
,
old
leader
and
young
leader
,
they
attacked
the
ambitious
*NL*
three-year-old
and
proceeded
to
destroy
him
.
He
was
beset
on
either
side
*NL*
by
the
merciless
fangs
of
his
erstwhile
comrades
.
Forgotten
were
the
*NL*
days
they
had
hunted
together
,
the
game
they
had
pulled
down
,
the
famine
*NL*
they
had
suffered
.
That
business
was
a
thing
of
the
past
.
The
business
*NL*
of
love
was
at
hand
--
ever
a
sterner
and
crueller
business
than
that
of
*NL*
food-getting
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
meanwhile
,
the
she-wolf
,
the
cause
of
it
all
,
sat
down
*NL*
contentedly
on
her
haunches
and
watched
.
She
was
even
pleased
.
This
was
*NL*
her
day
--
and
it
came
not
often
--
when
manes
bristled
,
and
fang
smote
fang
*NL*
or
ripped
and
tore
the
yielding
flesh
,
all
for
the
possession
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
business
of
love
the
three-year-old
,
who
had
made
this
his
*NL*
first
adventure
upon
it
,
yielded
up
his
life
.
On
either
side
of
his
body
*NL*
stood
his
two
rivals
.
They
were
gazing
at
the
she-wolf
,
who
sat
smiling
*NL*
in
the
snow
.
But
the
elder
leader
was
wise
,
very
wise
,
in
love
even
as
*NL*
in
battle
.
The
younger
leader
turned
his
head
to
lick
a
wound
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
The
curve
of
his
neck
was
turned
toward
his
rival
.
With
his
*NL*
one
eye
the
elder
saw
the
opportunity
.
He
darted
in
low
and
closed
with
*NL*
his
fangs
.
It
was
a
long
,
ripping
slash
,
and
deep
as
well
.
His
teeth
,
*NL*
in
passing
,
burst
the
wall
of
the
great
vein
of
the
throat
.
Then
he
*NL*
leaped
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
leader
snarled
terribly
,
but
his
snarl
broke
midmost
into
a
*NL*
tickling
cough
.
Bleeding
and
coughing
,
already
stricken
,
he
sprang
at
*NL*
the
elder
and
fought
while
life
faded
from
him
,
his
legs
going
weak
*NL*
beneath
him
,
the
light
of
day
dulling
on
his
eyes
,
his
blows
and
springs
*NL*
falling
shorter
and
shorter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
the
while
the
she-wolf
sat
on
her
haunches
and
smiled
.
She
was
*NL*
made
glad
in
vague
ways
by
the
battle
,
for
this
was
the
love-making
of
*NL*
the
Wild
,
the
sex-tragedy
of
the
natural
world
that
was
tragedy
only
to
*NL*
those
that
died
.
To
those
that
survived
it
was
not
tragedy
,
but
*NL*
realisation
and
achievement
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
young
leader
lay
in
the
snow
and
moved
no
more
,
One
Eye
stalked
*NL*
over
to
the
she-wolf
.
His
carriage
was
one
of
mingled
triumph
and
*NL*
caution
.
He
was
plainly
expectant
of
a
rebuff
,
and
he
was
just
as
*NL*
plainly
surprised
when
her
teeth
did
not
flash
out
at
him
in
anger
.
For
*NL*
the
first
time
she
met
him
with
a
kindly
manner
.
She
sniffed
noses
with
*NL*
him
,
and
even
condescended
to
leap
about
and
frisk
and
play
with
him
in
*NL*
quite
puppyish
fashion
.
And
he
,
for
all
his
grey
years
and
sage
*NL*
experience
,
behaved
quite
as
puppyishly
and
even
a
little
more
foolishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forgotten
already
were
the
vanquished
rivals
and
the
love-tale
*NL*
red-written
on
the
snow
.
Forgotten
,
save
once
,
when
old
One
Eye
stopped
*NL*
for
a
moment
to
lick
his
stiffening
wounds
.
Then
it
was
that
his
lips
*NL*
half
writhed
into
a
snarl
,
and
the
hair
of
his
neck
and
shoulders
*NL*
involuntarily
bristled
,
while
he
half
crouched
for
a
spring
,
his
claws
*NL*
spasmodically
clutching
into
the
snow-surface
for
firmer
footing
.
But
it
*NL*
was
all
forgotten
the
next
moment
,
as
he
sprang
after
the
she-wolf
,
who
*NL*
was
coyly
leading
him
a
chase
through
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
they
ran
side
by
side
,
like
good
friends
who
have
come
to
an
*NL*
understanding
.
The
days
passed
by
,
and
they
kept
together
,
hunting
their
*NL*
meat
and
killing
and
eating
it
in
common
.
After
a
time
the
she-wolf
*NL*
began
to
grow
restless
.
She
seemed
to
be
searching
for
something
that
*NL*
she
could
not
find
.
The
hollows
under
fallen
trees
seemed
to
attract
*NL*
her
,
and
she
spent
much
time
nosing
about
among
the
larger
snow-piled
*NL*
crevices
in
the
rocks
and
in
the
caves
of
overhanging
banks
.
Old
One
Eye
*NL*
was
not
interested
at
all
,
but
he
followed
her
good-naturedly
in
her
*NL*
quest
,
and
when
her
investigations
in
particular
places
were
unusually
*NL*
protracted
,
he
would
lie
down
and
wait
until
she
was
ready
to
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
remain
in
one
place
,
but
travelled
across
country
until
they
*NL*
regained
the
Mackenzie
River
,
down
which
they
slowly
went
,
leaving
it
*NL*
often
to
hunt
game
along
the
small
streams
that
entered
it
,
but
always
*NL*
returning
to
it
again
.
Sometimes
they
chanced
upon
other
wolves
,
usually
*NL*
in
pairs
;
but
there
was
no
friendliness
of
intercourse
displayed
on
*NL*
either
side
,
no
gladness
at
meeting
,
no
desire
to
return
to
the
*NL*
pack-formation
.
Several
times
they
encountered
solitary
wolves
.
These
*NL*
were
always
males
,
and
they
were
pressingly
insistent
on
joining
with
One
*NL*
Eye
and
his
mate
.
This
he
resented
,
and
when
she
stood
shoulder
to
*NL*
shoulder
with
him
,
bristling
and
showing
her
teeth
,
the
aspiring
solitary
*NL*
ones
would
back
off
,
turn-tail
,
and
continue
on
their
lonely
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
moonlight
night
,
running
through
the
quiet
forest
,
One
Eye
suddenly
*NL*
halted
.
His
muzzle
went
up
,
his
tail
stiffened
,
and
his
nostrils
dilated
*NL*
as
he
scented
the
air
.
One
foot
also
he
held
up
,
after
the
manner
of
a
*NL*
dog
.
He
was
not
satisfied
,
and
he
continued
to
smell
the
air
,
striving
*NL*
to
understand
the
message
borne
upon
it
to
him
.
One
careless
sniff
had
*NL*
satisfied
his
mate
,
and
she
trotted
on
to
reassure
him
.
Though
he
*NL*
followed
her
,
he
was
still
dubious
,
and
he
could
not
forbear
an
*NL*
occasional
halt
in
order
more
carefully
to
study
the
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
crept
out
cautiously
on
the
edge
of
a
large
open
space
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
trees
.
For
some
time
she
stood
alone
.
Then
One
Eye
,
creeping
and
*NL*
crawling
,
every
sense
on
the
alert
,
every
hair
radiating
infinite
*NL*
suspicion
,
joined
her
.
They
stood
side
by
side
,
watching
and
listening
*NL*
and
smelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
their
ears
came
the
sounds
of
dogs
wrangling
and
scuffling
,
the
*NL*
guttural
cries
of
men
,
the
sharper
voices
of
scolding
women
,
and
once
the
*NL*
shrill
and
plaintive
cry
of
a
child
.
With
the
exception
of
the
huge
*NL*
bulks
of
the
skin-lodges
,
little
could
be
seen
save
the
flames
of
the
*NL*
fire
,
broken
by
the
movements
of
intervening
bodies
,
and
the
smoke
rising
*NL*
slowly
on
the
quiet
air
.
But
to
their
nostrils
came
the
myriad
smells
of
*NL*
an
Indian
camp
,
carrying
a
story
that
was
largely
incomprehensible
to
One
*NL*
Eye
,
but
every
detail
of
which
the
she-wolf
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
strangely
stirred
,
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
with
an
increasing
*NL*
delight
.
But
old
One
Eye
was
doubtful
.
He
betrayed
his
apprehension
,
*NL*
and
started
tentatively
to
go
.
She
turned
and
touched
his
neck
with
her
*NL*
muzzle
in
a
reassuring
way
,
then
regarded
the
camp
again
.
A
new
*NL*
wistfulness
was
in
her
face
,
but
it
was
not
the
wistfulness
of
hunger
.
*NL*
She
was
thrilling
to
a
desire
that
urged
her
to
go
forward
,
to
be
in
*NL*
closer
to
that
fire
,
to
be
squabbling
with
the
dogs
,
and
to
be
avoiding
*NL*
and
dodging
the
stumbling
feet
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Eye
moved
impatiently
beside
her
;
her
unrest
came
back
upon
her
,
and
*NL*
she
knew
again
her
pressing
need
to
find
the
thing
for
which
she
*NL*
searched
.
She
turned
and
trotted
back
into
the
forest
,
to
the
great
*NL*
relief
of
One
Eye
,
who
trotted
a
little
to
the
fore
until
they
were
well
*NL*
within
the
shelter
of
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
slid
along
,
noiseless
as
shadows
,
in
the
moonlight
,
they
came
*NL*
upon
a
run-way
.
Both
noses
went
down
to
the
footprints
in
the
snow
.
*NL*
These
footprints
were
very
fresh
.
One
Eye
ran
ahead
cautiously
,
his
mate
*NL*
at
his
heels
.
The
broad
pads
of
their
feet
were
spread
wide
and
in
*NL*
contact
with
the
snow
were
like
velvet
.
One
Eye
caught
sight
of
a
dim
*NL*
movement
of
white
in
the
midst
of
the
white
.
His
sliding
gait
had
been
*NL*
deceptively
swift
,
but
it
was
as
nothing
to
the
speed
at
which
he
now
*NL*
ran
.
Before
him
was
bounding
the
faint
patch
of
white
he
had
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
running
along
a
narrow
alley
flanked
on
either
side
by
a
growth
*NL*
of
young
spruce
.
Through
the
trees
the
mouth
of
the
alley
could
be
seen
,
*NL*
opening
out
on
a
moonlit
glade
.
Old
One
Eye
was
rapidly
overhauling
the
*NL*
fleeing
shape
of
white
.
Bound
by
bound
he
gained
.
Now
he
was
upon
it
.
*NL*
One
leap
more
and
his
teeth
would
be
sinking
into
it
.
But
that
leap
was
*NL*
never
made
.
High
in
the
air
,
and
straight
up
,
soared
the
shape
of
white
,
*NL*
now
a
struggling
snowshoe
rabbit
that
leaped
and
bounded
,
executing
a
*NL*
fantastic
dance
there
above
him
in
the
air
and
never
once
returning
to
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Eye
sprang
back
with
a
snort
of
sudden
fright
,
then
shrank
down
to
*NL*
the
snow
and
crouched
,
snarling
threats
at
this
thing
of
fear
he
did
not
*NL*
understand
.
But
the
she-wolf
coolly
thrust
past
him
.
She
poised
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
then
sprang
for
the
dancing
rabbit
.
She
,
too
,
soared
high
,
but
*NL*
not
so
high
as
the
quarry
,
and
her
teeth
clipped
emptily
together
with
a
*NL*
metallic
snap
.
She
made
another
leap
,
and
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mate
had
slowly
relaxed
from
his
crouch
and
was
watching
her
.
He
now
*NL*
evinced
displeasure
at
her
repeated
failures
,
and
himself
made
a
mighty
*NL*
spring
upward
.
His
teeth
closed
upon
the
rabbit
,
and
he
bore
it
back
to
*NL*
earth
with
him
.
But
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
suspicious
crackling
*NL*
movement
beside
him
,
and
his
astonished
eye
saw
a
young
spruce
sapling
*NL*
bending
down
above
him
to
strike
him
.
His
jaws
let
go
their
grip
,
and
he
*NL*
leaped
backward
to
escape
this
strange
danger
,
his
lips
drawn
back
from
*NL*
his
fangs
,
his
throat
snarling
,
every
hair
bristling
with
rage
and
*NL*
fright
.
And
in
that
moment
the
sapling
reared
its
slender
length
upright
*NL*
and
the
rabbit
soared
dancing
in
the
air
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
she-wolf
was
angry
.
She
sank
her
fangs
into
her
mate
's
shoulder
in
*NL*
reproof
;
and
he
,
frightened
,
unaware
of
what
constituted
this
new
*NL*
onslaught
,
struck
back
ferociously
and
in
still
greater
fright
,
ripping
*NL*
down
the
side
of
the
she-wolf
's
muzzle
.
For
him
to
resent
such
reproof
*NL*
was
equally
unexpected
to
her
,
and
she
sprang
upon
him
in
snarling
*NL*
indignation
.
Then
he
discovered
his
mistake
and
tried
to
placate
her
.
*NL*
But
she
proceeded
to
punish
him
roundly
,
until
he
gave
over
all
attempts
*NL*
at
placation
,
and
whirled
in
a
circle
,
his
head
away
from
her
,
his
*NL*
shoulders
receiving
the
punishment
of
her
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
rabbit
danced
above
them
in
the
air
.
The
she-wolf
*NL*
sat
down
in
the
snow
,
and
old
One
Eye
,
now
more
in
fear
of
his
mate
than
*NL*
of
the
mysterious
sapling
,
again
sprang
for
the
rabbit
.
As
he
sank
back
*NL*
with
it
between
his
teeth
,
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
sapling
.
As
before
,
it
*NL*
followed
him
back
to
earth
.
He
crouched
down
under
the
impending
blow
,
*NL*
his
hair
bristling
,
but
his
teeth
still
keeping
tight
hold
of
the
rabbit
.
*NL*
But
the
blow
did
not
fall
.
The
sapling
remained
bent
above
him
.
When
he
*NL*
moved
it
moved
,
and
he
growled
at
it
through
his
clenched
jaws
;
when
he
*NL*
remained
still
,
it
remained
still
,
and
he
concluded
it
was
safer
to
*NL*
continue
remaining
still
.
Yet
the
warm
blood
of
the
rabbit
tasted
good
*NL*
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
mate
who
relieved
him
from
the
quandary
in
which
he
found
*NL*
himself
.
She
took
the
rabbit
from
him
,
and
while
the
sapling
swayed
and
*NL*
teetered
threateningly
above
her
she
calmly
gnawed
off
the
rabbit
's
head
.
*NL*
At
once
the
sapling
shot
up
,
and
after
that
gave
no
more
trouble
,
*NL*
remaining
in
the
decorous
and
perpendicular
position
in
which
nature
had
*NL*
intended
it
to
grow
.
Then
,
between
them
,
the
she-wolf
and
One
Eye
*NL*
devoured
the
game
which
the
mysterious
sapling
had
caught
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
other
run-ways
and
alleys
where
rabbits
were
hanging
in
the
*NL*
air
,
and
the
wolf-pair
prospected
them
all
,
the
she-wolf
leading
the
way
,
*NL*
old
One
Eye
following
and
observant
,
learning
the
method
of
robbing
*NL*
snares
--
a
knowledge
destined
to
stand
him
in
good
stead
in
the
days
to
*NL*
come
.

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
LAIR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
days
the
she-wolf
and
One
Eye
hung
about
the
Indian
camp
.
He
was
*NL*
worried
and
apprehensive
,
yet
the
camp
lured
his
mate
and
she
was
loath
*NL*
to
depart
.
But
when
,
one
morning
,
the
air
was
rent
with
the
report
of
a
*NL*
rifle
close
at
hand
,
and
a
bullet
smashed
against
a
tree
trunk
several
*NL*
inches
from
One
Eye
's
head
,
they
hesitated
no
more
,
but
went
off
on
a
*NL*
long
,
swinging
lope
that
put
quick
miles
between
them
and
the
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
go
far
--
a
couple
of
days
'
journey
.
The
she-wolf
's
need
to
*NL*
find
the
thing
for
which
she
searched
had
now
become
imperative
.
She
was
*NL*
getting
very
heavy
,
and
could
run
but
slowly
.
Once
,
in
the
pursuit
of
a
*NL*
rabbit
,
which
she
ordinarily
would
have
caught
with
ease
,
she
gave
over
*NL*
and
lay
down
and
rested
.
One
Eye
came
to
her
;
but
when
he
touched
her
*NL*
neck
gently
with
his
muzzle
she
snapped
at
him
with
such
quick
fierceness
*NL*
that
he
tumbled
over
backward
and
cut
a
ridiculous
figure
in
his
effort
*NL*
to
escape
her
teeth
.
Her
temper
was
now
shorter
than
ever
;
but
he
had
*NL*
become
more
patient
than
ever
and
more
solicitous
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
found
the
thing
for
which
she
sought
.
It
was
a
few
miles
up
*NL*
a
small
stream
that
in
the
summer
time
flowed
into
the
Mackenzie
,
but
*NL*
that
then
was
frozen
over
and
frozen
down
to
its
rocky
bottom
--
a
dead
*NL*
stream
of
solid
white
from
source
to
mouth
.
The
she-wolf
was
trotting
*NL*
wearily
along
,
her
mate
well
in
advance
,
when
she
came
upon
the
*NL*
overhanging
,
high
clay-bank
.
She
turned
aside
and
trotted
over
to
it
.
*NL*
The
wear
and
tear
of
spring
storms
and
melting
snows
had
underwashed
the
*NL*
bank
and
in
one
place
had
made
a
small
cave
out
of
a
narrow
fissure
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
looked
the
wall
over
carefully
.
*NL*
Then
,
on
one
side
and
the
other
,
she
ran
along
the
base
of
the
wall
to
*NL*
where
its
abrupt
bulk
merged
from
the
softer-lined
landscape
.
Returning
*NL*
to
the
cave
,
she
entered
its
narrow
mouth
.
For
a
short
three
feet
she
*NL*
was
compelled
to
crouch
,
then
the
walls
widened
and
rose
higher
in
a
*NL*
little
round
chamber
nearly
six
feet
in
diameter
.
The
roof
barely
*NL*
cleared
her
head
.
It
was
dry
and
cosey
.
She
inspected
it
with
*NL*
painstaking
care
,
while
One
Eye
,
who
had
returned
,
stood
in
the
entrance
*NL*
and
patiently
watched
her
.
She
dropped
her
head
,
with
her
nose
to
the
*NL*
ground
and
directed
toward
a
point
near
to
her
closely
bunched
feet
,
and
*NL*
around
this
point
she
circled
several
times
;
then
,
with
a
tired
sigh
that
*NL*
was
almost
a
grunt
,
she
curled
her
body
in
,
relaxed
her
legs
,
and
dropped
*NL*
down
,
her
head
toward
the
entrance
.
One
Eye
,
with
pointed
,
interested
*NL*
ears
,
laughed
at
her
,
and
beyond
,
outlined
against
the
white
light
,
she
*NL*
could
see
the
brush
of
his
tail
waving
good-naturedly
.
Her
own
ears
,
*NL*
with
a
snuggling
movement
,
laid
their
sharp
points
backward
and
down
*NL*
against
the
head
for
a
moment
,
while
her
mouth
opened
and
her
tongue
*NL*
lolled
peaceably
out
,
and
in
this
way
she
expressed
that
she
was
pleased
*NL*
and
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Eye
was
hungry
.
Though
he
lay
down
in
the
entrance
and
slept
,
his
*NL*
sleep
was
fitful
.
He
kept
awaking
and
cocking
his
ears
at
the
bright
*NL*
world
without
,
where
the
April
sun
was
blazing
across
the
snow
.
When
he
*NL*
dozed
,
upon
his
ears
would
steal
the
faint
whispers
of
hidden
trickles
of
*NL*
running
water
,
and
he
would
rouse
and
listen
intently
.
The
sun
had
come
*NL*
back
,
and
all
the
awakening
Northland
world
was
calling
to
him
.
Life
was
*NL*
stirring
.
The
feel
of
spring
was
in
the
air
,
the
feel
of
growing
life
*NL*
under
the
snow
,
of
sap
ascending
in
the
trees
,
of
buds
bursting
the
*NL*
shackles
of
the
frost
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
cast
anxious
glances
at
his
mate
,
but
she
showed
no
desire
to
get
up
.
*NL*
He
looked
outside
,
and
half
a
dozen
snow-birds
fluttered
across
his
field
*NL*
of
vision
.
He
started
to
get
up
,
then
looked
back
to
his
mate
again
,
and
*NL*
settled
down
and
dozed
.
A
shrill
and
minute
singing
stole
upon
his
*NL*
hearing
.
Once
,
and
twice
,
he
sleepily
brushed
his
nose
with
his
paw
.
*NL*
Then
he
woke
up
.
There
,
buzzing
in
the
air
at
the
tip
of
his
nose
,
was
a
*NL*
lone
mosquito
.
It
was
a
full-grown
mosquito
,
one
that
had
lain
frozen
in
*NL*
a
dry
log
all
winter
and
that
had
now
been
thawed
out
by
the
sun
.
He
*NL*
could
resist
the
call
of
the
world
no
longer
.
Besides
,
he
was
hungry
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crawled
over
to
his
mate
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
get
up
.
But
she
*NL*
only
snarled
at
him
,
and
he
walked
out
alone
into
the
bright
sunshine
to
*NL*
find
the
snow-surface
soft
under
foot
and
the
travelling
difficult
.
He
*NL*
went
up
the
frozen
bed
of
the
stream
,
where
the
snow
,
shaded
by
the
*NL*
trees
,
was
yet
hard
and
crystalline
.
He
was
gone
eight
hours
,
and
he
*NL*
came
back
through
the
darkness
hungrier
than
when
he
had
started
.
He
had
*NL*
found
game
,
but
he
had
not
caught
it
.
He
had
broken
through
the
melting
*NL*
snow
crust
,
and
wallowed
,
while
the
snowshoe
rabbits
had
skimmed
along
on
*NL*
top
lightly
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
with
a
sudden
shock
of
suspicion
.
*NL*
Faint
,
strange
sounds
came
from
within
.
They
were
sounds
not
made
by
his
*NL*
mate
,
and
yet
they
were
remotely
familiar
.
He
bellied
cautiously
inside
*NL*
and
was
met
by
a
warning
snarl
from
the
she-wolf
.
This
he
received
*NL*
without
perturbation
,
though
he
obeyed
it
by
keeping
his
distance
;
but
he
*NL*
remained
interested
in
the
other
sounds
--
faint
,
muffled
sobbings
and
*NL*
slubberings
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mate
warned
him
irritably
away
,
and
he
curled
up
and
slept
in
the
*NL*
entrance
.
When
morning
came
and
a
dim
light
pervaded
the
lair
,
he
again
*NL*
sought
after
the
source
of
the
remotely
familiar
sounds
.
There
was
a
new
*NL*
note
in
his
mate
's
warning
snarl
.
It
was
a
jealous
note
,
and
he
was
very
*NL*
careful
in
keeping
a
respectful
distance
.
Nevertheless
,
he
made
out
,
*NL*
sheltering
between
her
legs
against
the
length
of
her
body
,
five
strange
*NL*
little
bundles
of
life
,
very
feeble
,
very
helpless
,
making
tiny
*NL*
whimpering
noises
,
with
eyes
that
did
not
open
to
the
light
.
He
was
*NL*
surprised
.
It
was
not
the
first
time
in
his
long
and
successful
life
*NL*
that
this
thing
had
happened
.
It
had
happened
many
times
,
yet
each
time
*NL*
it
was
as
fresh
a
surprise
as
ever
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mate
looked
at
him
anxiously
.
Every
little
while
she
emitted
a
low
*NL*
growl
,
and
at
times
,
when
it
seemed
to
her
he
approached
too
near
,
the
*NL*
growl
shot
up
in
her
throat
to
a
sharp
snarl
.
Of
her
own
experience
she
*NL*
had
no
memory
of
the
thing
happening
;
but
in
her
instinct
,
which
was
the
*NL*
experience
of
all
the
mothers
of
wolves
,
there
lurked
a
memory
of
fathers
*NL*
that
had
eaten
their
new-born
and
helpless
progeny
.
It
manifested
itself
*NL*
as
a
fear
strong
within
her
,
that
made
her
prevent
One
Eye
from
more
*NL*
closely
inspecting
the
cubs
he
had
fathered
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
danger
.
Old
One
Eye
was
feeling
the
urge
of
an
impulse
,
*NL*
that
was
,
in
turn
,
an
instinct
that
had
come
down
to
him
from
all
the
*NL*
fathers
of
wolves
.
He
did
not
question
it
,
nor
puzzle
over
it
.
It
was
*NL*
there
,
in
the
fibre
of
his
being
;
and
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
*NL*
the
world
that
he
should
obey
it
by
turning
his
back
on
his
new-born
*NL*
family
and
by
trotting
out
and
away
on
the
meat-trail
whereby
he
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
or
six
miles
from
the
lair
,
the
stream
divided
,
its
forks
going
off
*NL*
among
the
mountains
at
a
right
angle
.
Here
,
leading
up
the
left
fork
,
he
*NL*
came
upon
a
fresh
track
.
He
smelled
it
and
found
it
so
recent
that
he
*NL*
crouched
swiftly
,
and
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
it
disappeared
.
*NL*
Then
he
turned
deliberately
and
took
the
right
fork
.
The
footprint
was
*NL*
much
larger
than
the
one
his
own
feet
made
,
and
he
knew
that
in
the
wake
*NL*
of
such
a
trail
there
was
little
meat
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
a
mile
up
the
right
fork
,
his
quick
ears
caught
the
sound
of
gnawing
*NL*
teeth
.
He
stalked
the
quarry
and
found
it
to
be
a
porcupine
,
standing
*NL*
upright
against
a
tree
and
trying
his
teeth
on
the
bark
.
One
Eye
*NL*
approached
carefully
but
hopelessly
.
He
knew
the
breed
,
though
he
had
*NL*
never
met
it
so
far
north
before
;
and
never
in
his
long
life
had
*NL*
porcupine
served
him
for
a
meal
.
But
he
had
long
since
learned
that
*NL*
there
was
such
a
thing
as
Chance
,
or
Opportunity
,
and
he
continued
to
*NL*
draw
near
.
There
was
never
any
telling
what
might
happen
,
for
with
live
*NL*
things
events
were
somehow
always
happening
differently
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porcupine
rolled
itself
into
a
ball
,
radiating
long
,
sharp
needles
in
*NL*
all
directions
that
defied
attack
.
In
his
youth
One
Eye
had
once
sniffed
*NL*
too
near
a
similar
,
apparently
inert
ball
of
quills
,
and
had
the
tail
*NL*
flick
out
suddenly
in
his
face
.
One
quill
he
had
carried
away
in
his
*NL*
muzzle
,
where
it
had
remained
for
weeks
,
a
rankling
flame
,
until
it
*NL*
finally
worked
out
.
So
he
lay
down
,
in
a
comfortable
crouching
position
,
*NL*
his
nose
fully
a
foot
away
,
and
out
of
the
line
of
the
tail
.
Thus
he
*NL*
waited
,
keeping
perfectly
quiet
.
There
was
no
telling
.
Something
might
*NL*
happen
.
The
porcupine
might
unroll
.
There
might
be
opportunity
for
a
*NL*
deft
and
ripping
thrust
of
paw
into
the
tender
,
unguarded
belly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
arose
,
growled
wrathfully
at
the
*NL*
motionless
ball
,
and
trotted
on
.
He
had
waited
too
often
and
futilely
in
*NL*
the
past
for
porcupines
to
unroll
,
to
waste
any
more
time
.
He
continued
*NL*
up
the
right
fork
.
The
day
wore
along
,
and
nothing
rewarded
his
hunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
urge
of
his
awakened
instinct
of
fatherhood
was
strong
upon
him
.
He
*NL*
must
find
meat
.
In
the
afternoon
he
blundered
upon
a
ptarmigan
.
He
came
*NL*
out
of
a
thicket
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
slow-witted
*NL*
bird
.
It
was
sitting
on
a
log
,
not
a
foot
beyond
the
end
of
his
nose
.
*NL*
Each
saw
the
other
.
The
bird
made
a
startled
rise
,
but
he
struck
it
with
*NL*
his
paw
,
and
smashed
it
down
to
earth
,
then
pounced
upon
it
,
and
caught
*NL*
it
in
his
teeth
as
it
scuttled
across
the
snow
trying
to
rise
in
the
air
*NL*
again
.
As
his
teeth
crunched
through
the
tender
flesh
and
fragile
bones
,
*NL*
he
began
naturally
to
eat
.
Then
he
remembered
,
and
,
turning
on
the
back
-
*NL*
track
,
started
for
home
,
carrying
the
ptarmigan
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mile
above
the
forks
,
running
velvet-footed
as
was
his
custom
,
a
*NL*
gliding
shadow
that
cautiously
prospected
each
new
vista
of
the
trail
,
he
*NL*
came
upon
later
imprints
of
the
large
tracks
he
had
discovered
in
the
*NL*
early
morning
.
As
the
track
led
his
way
,
he
followed
,
prepared
to
meet
*NL*
the
maker
of
it
at
every
turn
of
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slid
his
head
around
a
corner
of
rock
,
where
began
an
unusually
large
*NL*
bend
in
the
stream
,
and
his
quick
eyes
made
out
something
that
sent
him
*NL*
crouching
swiftly
down
.
It
was
the
maker
of
the
track
,
a
large
female
*NL*
lynx
.
She
was
crouching
as
he
had
crouched
once
that
day
,
in
front
of
*NL*
her
the
tight-rolled
ball
of
quills
.
If
he
had
been
a
gliding
shadow
*NL*
before
,
he
now
became
the
ghost
of
such
a
shadow
,
as
he
crept
and
circled
*NL*
around
,
and
came
up
well
to
leeward
of
the
silent
,
motionless
pair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
down
in
the
snow
,
depositing
the
ptarmigan
beside
him
,
and
with
*NL*
eyes
peering
through
the
needles
of
a
low-growing
spruce
he
watched
the
*NL*
play
of
life
before
him
--
the
waiting
lynx
and
the
waiting
porcupine
,
each
*NL*
intent
on
life
;
and
,
such
was
the
curiousness
of
the
game
,
the
way
of
*NL*
life
for
one
lay
in
the
eating
of
the
other
,
and
the
way
of
life
for
the
*NL*
other
lay
in
being
not
eaten
.
While
old
One
Eye
,
the
wolf
crouching
in
*NL*
the
covert
,
played
his
part
,
too
,
in
the
game
,
waiting
for
some
strange
*NL*
freak
of
Chance
,
that
might
help
him
on
the
meat-trail
which
was
his
way
*NL*
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
passed
,
an
hour
;
and
nothing
happened
.
The
ball
of
quills
*NL*
might
have
been
a
stone
for
all
it
moved
;
the
lynx
might
have
been
frozen
*NL*
to
marble
;
and
old
One
Eye
might
have
been
dead
.
Yet
all
three
animals
*NL*
were
keyed
to
a
tenseness
of
living
that
was
almost
painful
,
and
scarcely
*NL*
ever
would
it
come
to
them
to
be
more
alive
than
they
were
then
in
their
*NL*
seeming
petrifaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Eye
moved
slightly
and
peered
forth
with
increased
eagerness
.
*NL*
Something
was
happening
.
The
porcupine
had
at
last
decided
that
its
*NL*
enemy
had
gone
away
.
Slowly
,
cautiously
,
it
was
unrolling
its
ball
of
*NL*
impregnable
armour
.
It
was
agitated
by
no
tremor
of
anticipation
.
*NL*
Slowly
,
slowly
,
the
bristling
ball
straightened
out
and
lengthened
.
One
*NL*
Eye
watching
,
felt
a
sudden
moistness
in
his
mouth
and
a
drooling
of
*NL*
saliva
,
involuntary
,
excited
by
the
living
meat
that
was
spreading
itself
*NL*
like
a
repast
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
quite
entirely
had
the
porcupine
unrolled
when
it
discovered
its
*NL*
enemy
.
In
that
instant
the
lynx
struck
.
The
blow
was
like
a
flash
of
*NL*
light
.
The
paw
,
with
rigid
claws
curving
like
talons
,
shot
under
the
*NL*
tender
belly
and
came
back
with
a
swift
ripping
movement
.
Had
the
*NL*
porcupine
been
entirely
unrolled
,
or
had
it
not
discovered
its
enemy
a
*NL*
fraction
of
a
second
before
the
blow
was
struck
,
the
paw
would
have
*NL*
escaped
unscathed
;
but
a
side-flick
of
the
tail
sank
sharp
quills
into
it
*NL*
as
it
was
withdrawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
had
happened
at
once
--
the
blow
,
the
counter-blow
,
the
squeal
*NL*
of
agony
from
the
porcupine
,
the
big
cat
's
squall
of
sudden
hurt
and
*NL*
astonishment
.
One
Eye
half
arose
in
his
excitement
,
his
ears
up
,
his
*NL*
tail
straight
out
and
quivering
behind
him
.
The
lynx
's
bad
temper
got
*NL*
the
best
of
her
.
She
sprang
savagely
at
the
thing
that
had
hurt
her
.
But
*NL*
the
porcupine
,
squealing
and
grunting
,
with
disrupted
anatomy
trying
*NL*
feebly
to
roll
up
into
its
ball-protection
,
flicked
out
its
tail
again
,
*NL*
and
again
the
big
cat
squalled
with
hurt
and
astonishment
.
Then
she
fell
*NL*
to
backing
away
and
sneezing
,
her
nose
bristling
with
quills
like
a
*NL*
monstrous
pin-cushion
.
She
brushed
her
nose
with
her
paws
,
trying
to
*NL*
dislodge
the
fiery
darts
,
thrust
it
into
the
snow
,
and
rubbed
it
against
*NL*
twigs
and
branches
,
and
all
the
time
leaping
about
,
ahead
,
sidewise
,
up
*NL*
and
down
,
in
a
frenzy
of
pain
and
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sneezed
continually
,
and
her
stub
of
a
tail
was
doing
its
best
toward
*NL*
lashing
about
by
giving
quick
,
violent
jerks
.
She
quit
her
antics
,
and
*NL*
quieted
down
for
a
long
minute
.
One
Eye
watched
.
And
even
he
could
not
*NL*
repress
a
start
and
an
involuntary
bristling
of
hair
along
his
back
when
*NL*
she
suddenly
leaped
,
without
warning
,
straight
up
in
the
air
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
emitting
a
long
and
most
terrible
squall
.
Then
she
sprang
away
,
up
*NL*
the
trail
,
squalling
with
every
leap
she
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
until
her
racket
had
faded
away
in
the
distance
and
died
out
*NL*
that
One
Eye
ventured
forth
.
He
walked
as
delicately
as
though
all
the
*NL*
snow
were
carpeted
with
porcupine
quills
,
erect
and
ready
to
pierce
the
*NL*
soft
pads
of
his
feet
.
The
porcupine
met
his
approach
with
a
furious
*NL*
squealing
and
a
clashing
of
its
long
teeth
.
It
had
managed
to
roll
up
in
*NL*
a
ball
again
,
but
it
was
not
quite
the
old
compact
ball
;
its
muscles
were
*NL*
too
much
torn
for
that
.
It
had
been
ripped
almost
in
half
,
and
was
still
*NL*
bleeding
profusely
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Eye
scooped
out
mouthfuls
of
the
blood-soaked
snow
,
and
chewed
and
*NL*
tasted
and
swallowed
.
This
served
as
a
relish
,
and
his
hunger
increased
*NL*
mightily
;
but
he
was
too
old
in
the
world
to
forget
his
caution
.
He
*NL*
waited
.
He
lay
down
and
waited
,
while
the
porcupine
grated
its
teeth
and
*NL*
uttered
grunts
and
sobs
and
occasional
sharp
little
squeals
.
In
a
little
*NL*
while
,
One
Eye
noticed
that
the
quills
were
drooping
and
that
a
great
*NL*
quivering
had
set
up
.
The
quivering
came
to
an
end
suddenly
.
There
was
*NL*
a
final
defiant
clash
of
the
long
teeth
.
Then
all
the
quills
drooped
*NL*
quite
down
,
and
the
body
relaxed
and
moved
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
nervous
,
shrinking
paw
,
One
Eye
stretched
out
the
porcupine
to
its
*NL*
full
length
and
turned
it
over
on
its
back
.
Nothing
had
happened
.
It
*NL*
was
surely
dead
.
He
studied
it
intently
for
a
moment
,
then
took
a
*NL*
careful
grip
with
his
teeth
and
started
off
down
the
stream
,
partly
*NL*
carrying
,
partly
dragging
the
porcupine
,
with
head
turned
to
the
side
so
*NL*
as
to
avoid
stepping
on
the
prickly
mass
.
He
recollected
something
,
*NL*
dropped
the
burden
,
and
trotted
back
to
where
he
had
left
the
ptarmigan
.
*NL*
He
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
.
He
knew
clearly
what
was
to
be
done
,
and
*NL*
this
he
did
by
promptly
eating
the
ptarmigan
.
Then
he
returned
and
took
*NL*
up
his
burden
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
dragged
the
result
of
his
day
's
hunt
into
the
cave
,
the
she-wolf
*NL*
inspected
it
,
turned
her
muzzle
to
him
,
and
lightly
licked
him
on
the
*NL*
neck
.
But
the
next
instant
she
was
warning
him
away
from
the
cubs
with
a
*NL*
snarl
that
was
less
harsh
than
usual
and
that
was
more
apologetic
than
*NL*
menacing
.
Her
instinctive
fear
of
the
father
of
her
progeny
was
toning
*NL*
down
.
He
was
behaving
as
a
wolf-father
should
,
and
manifesting
no
unholy
*NL*
desire
to
devour
the
young
lives
she
had
brought
into
the
world
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
GREY
CUB
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
different
from
his
brothers
and
sisters
.
Their
hair
already
*NL*
betrayed
the
reddish
hue
inherited
from
their
mother
,
the
she-wolf
;
while
*NL*
he
alone
,
in
this
particular
,
took
after
his
father
.
He
was
the
one
*NL*
little
grey
cub
of
the
litter
.
He
had
bred
true
to
the
straight
wolf
-
*NL*
stock
--
in
fact
,
he
had
bred
true
to
old
One
Eye
himself
,
physically
,
with
*NL*
but
a
single
exception
,
and
that
was
he
had
two
eyes
to
his
father
's
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grey
cub
's
eyes
had
not
been
open
long
,
yet
already
he
could
see
with
*NL*
steady
clearness
.
And
while
his
eyes
were
still
closed
,
he
had
felt
,
*NL*
tasted
,
and
smelled
.
He
knew
his
two
brothers
and
his
two
sisters
very
*NL*
well
.
He
had
begun
to
romp
with
them
in
a
feeble
,
awkward
way
,
and
even
*NL*
to
squabble
,
his
little
throat
vibrating
with
a
queer
rasping
noise
-LRB-
the
*NL*
forerunner
of
the
growl
-RRB-
,
as
he
worked
himself
into
a
passion
.
And
long
*NL*
before
his
eyes
had
opened
he
had
learned
by
touch
,
taste
,
and
smell
to
*NL*
know
his
mother
--
a
fount
of
warmth
and
liquid
food
and
tenderness
.
She
*NL*
possessed
a
gentle
,
caressing
tongue
that
soothed
him
when
it
passed
over
*NL*
his
soft
little
body
,
and
that
impelled
him
to
snuggle
close
against
her
*NL*
and
to
doze
off
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
first
month
of
his
life
had
been
passed
thus
in
sleeping
;
but
*NL*
now
he
could
see
quite
well
,
and
he
stayed
awake
for
longer
periods
of
*NL*
time
,
and
he
was
coming
to
learn
his
world
quite
well
.
His
world
was
*NL*
gloomy
;
but
he
did
not
know
that
,
for
he
knew
no
other
world
.
It
was
dim
-
*NL*
lighted
;
but
his
eyes
had
never
had
to
adjust
themselves
to
any
other
*NL*
light
.
His
world
was
very
small
.
Its
limits
were
the
walls
of
the
lair
;
*NL*
but
as
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
wide
world
outside
,
he
was
never
*NL*
oppressed
by
the
narrow
confines
of
his
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
early
discovered
that
one
wall
of
his
world
was
different
from
*NL*
the
rest
.
This
was
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
the
source
of
light
.
He
*NL*
had
discovered
that
it
was
different
from
the
other
walls
long
before
he
*NL*
had
any
thoughts
of
his
own
,
any
conscious
volitions
.
It
had
been
an
*NL*
irresistible
attraction
before
ever
his
eyes
opened
and
looked
upon
it
.
*NL*
The
light
from
it
had
beat
upon
his
sealed
lids
,
and
the
eyes
and
the
*NL*
optic
nerves
had
pulsated
to
little
,
sparklike
flashes
,
warm-coloured
and
*NL*
strangely
pleasing
.
The
life
of
his
body
,
and
of
every
fibre
of
his
*NL*
body
,
the
life
that
was
the
very
substance
of
his
body
and
that
was
apart
*NL*
from
his
own
personal
life
,
had
yearned
toward
this
light
and
urged
his
*NL*
body
toward
it
in
the
same
way
that
the
cunning
chemistry
of
a
plant
*NL*
urges
it
toward
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
,
in
the
beginning
,
before
his
conscious
life
dawned
,
he
had
*NL*
crawled
toward
the
mouth
of
the
cave
.
And
in
this
his
brothers
and
*NL*
sisters
were
one
with
him
.
Never
,
in
that
period
,
did
any
of
them
crawl
*NL*
toward
the
dark
corners
of
the
back-wall
.
The
light
drew
them
as
if
they
*NL*
were
plants
;
the
chemistry
of
the
life
that
composed
them
demanded
the
*NL*
light
as
a
necessity
of
being
;
and
their
little
puppet-bodies
crawled
*NL*
blindly
and
chemically
,
like
the
tendrils
of
a
vine
.
Later
on
,
when
each
*NL*
developed
individuality
and
became
personally
conscious
of
impulsions
and
*NL*
desires
,
the
attraction
of
the
light
increased
.
They
were
always
*NL*
crawling
and
sprawling
toward
it
,
and
being
driven
back
from
it
by
their
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
this
way
that
the
grey
cub
learned
other
attributes
of
his
*NL*
mother
than
the
soft
,
soothing
tongue
.
In
his
insistent
crawling
toward
*NL*
the
light
,
he
discovered
in
her
a
nose
that
with
a
sharp
nudge
*NL*
administered
rebuke
,
and
later
,
a
paw
,
that
crushed
him
down
and
rolled
*NL*
him
over
and
over
with
swift
,
calculating
stroke
.
Thus
he
learned
hurt
;
*NL*
and
on
top
of
it
he
learned
to
avoid
hurt
,
first
,
by
not
incurring
the
*NL*
risk
of
it
;
and
second
,
when
he
had
incurred
the
risk
,
by
dodging
and
by
*NL*
retreating
.
These
were
conscious
actions
,
and
were
the
results
of
his
*NL*
first
generalisations
upon
the
world
.
Before
that
he
had
recoiled
*NL*
automatically
from
hurt
,
as
he
had
crawled
automatically
toward
the
*NL*
light
.
After
that
he
recoiled
from
hurt
because
he
_
knew
_
that
it
was
*NL*
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
fierce
little
cub
.
So
were
his
brothers
and
sisters
.
It
was
to
*NL*
be
expected
.
He
was
a
carnivorous
animal
.
He
came
of
a
breed
of
meat
-
*NL*
killers
and
meat-eaters
.
His
father
and
mother
lived
wholly
upon
meat
.
*NL*
The
milk
he
had
sucked
with
his
first
flickering
life
,
was
milk
*NL*
transformed
directly
from
meat
,
and
now
,
at
a
month
old
,
when
his
eyes
*NL*
had
been
open
for
but
a
week
,
he
was
beginning
himself
to
eat
meat
--
meat
*NL*
half-digested
by
the
she-wolf
and
disgorged
for
the
five
growing
cubs
*NL*
that
already
made
too
great
demand
upon
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
,
further
,
the
fiercest
of
the
litter
.
He
could
make
a
louder
*NL*
rasping
growl
than
any
of
them
.
His
tiny
rages
were
much
more
terrible
*NL*
than
theirs
.
It
was
he
that
first
learned
the
trick
of
rolling
a
fellow
-
*NL*
cub
over
with
a
cunning
paw-stroke
.
And
it
was
he
that
first
gripped
*NL*
another
cub
by
the
ear
and
pulled
and
tugged
and
growled
through
jaws
*NL*
tight-clenched
.
And
certainly
it
was
he
that
caused
the
mother
the
most
*NL*
trouble
in
keeping
her
litter
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fascination
of
the
light
for
the
grey
cub
increased
from
day
to
day
.
*NL*
He
was
perpetually
departing
on
yard-long
adventures
toward
the
cave
's
*NL*
entrance
,
and
as
perpetually
being
driven
back
.
Only
he
did
not
know
it
*NL*
for
an
entrance
.
He
did
not
know
anything
about
entrances
--
passages
*NL*
whereby
one
goes
from
one
place
to
another
place
.
He
did
not
know
any
*NL*
other
place
,
much
less
of
a
way
to
get
there
.
So
to
him
the
entrance
of
*NL*
the
cave
was
a
wall
--
a
wall
of
light
.
As
the
sun
was
to
the
outside
*NL*
dweller
,
this
wall
was
to
him
the
sun
of
his
world
.
It
attracted
him
as
*NL*
a
candle
attracts
a
moth
.
He
was
always
striving
to
attain
it
.
The
life
*NL*
that
was
so
swiftly
expanding
within
him
,
urged
him
continually
toward
*NL*
the
wall
of
light
.
The
life
that
was
within
him
knew
that
it
was
the
one
*NL*
way
out
,
the
way
he
was
predestined
to
tread
.
But
he
himself
did
not
*NL*
know
anything
about
it
.
He
did
not
know
there
was
any
outside
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
strange
thing
about
this
wall
of
light
.
His
father
-LRB-
he
had
*NL*
already
come
to
recognise
his
father
as
the
one
other
dweller
in
the
*NL*
world
,
a
creature
like
his
mother
,
who
slept
near
the
light
and
was
a
*NL*
bringer
of
meat
-RRB-
--
his
father
had
a
way
of
walking
right
into
the
white
*NL*
far
wall
and
disappearing
.
The
grey
cub
could
not
understand
this
.
*NL*
Though
never
permitted
by
his
mother
to
approach
that
wall
,
he
had
*NL*
approached
the
other
walls
,
and
encountered
hard
obstruction
on
the
end
*NL*
of
his
tender
nose
.
This
hurt
.
And
after
several
such
adventures
,
he
*NL*
left
the
walls
alone
.
Without
thinking
about
it
,
he
accepted
this
*NL*
disappearing
into
the
wall
as
a
peculiarity
of
his
father
,
as
milk
and
*NL*
half-digested
meat
were
peculiarities
of
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
the
grey
cub
was
not
given
to
thinking
--
at
least
,
to
the
kind
of
*NL*
thinking
customary
of
men
.
His
brain
worked
in
dim
ways
.
Yet
his
*NL*
conclusions
were
as
sharp
and
distinct
as
those
achieved
by
men
.
He
had
*NL*
a
method
of
accepting
things
,
without
questioning
the
why
and
wherefore
.
*NL*
In
reality
,
this
was
the
act
of
classification
.
He
was
never
disturbed
*NL*
over
why
a
thing
happened
.
How
it
happened
was
sufficient
for
him
.
Thus
,
*NL*
when
he
had
bumped
his
nose
on
the
back-wall
a
few
times
,
he
accepted
*NL*
that
he
would
not
disappear
into
walls
.
In
the
same
way
he
accepted
that
*NL*
his
father
could
disappear
into
walls
.
But
he
was
not
in
the
least
*NL*
disturbed
by
desire
to
find
out
the
reason
for
the
difference
between
his
*NL*
father
and
himself
.
Logic
and
physics
were
no
part
of
his
mental
make
-
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
most
creatures
of
the
Wild
,
he
early
experienced
famine
.
There
came
*NL*
a
time
when
not
only
did
the
meat-supply
cease
,
but
the
milk
no
longer
*NL*
came
from
his
mother
's
breast
.
At
first
,
the
cubs
whimpered
and
cried
,
*NL*
but
for
the
most
part
they
slept
.
It
was
not
long
before
they
were
*NL*
reduced
to
a
coma
of
hunger
.
There
were
no
more
spats
and
squabbles
,
no
*NL*
more
tiny
rages
nor
attempts
at
growling
;
while
the
adventures
toward
the
*NL*
far
white
wall
ceased
altogether
.
The
cubs
slept
,
while
the
life
that
*NL*
was
in
them
flickered
and
died
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Eye
was
desperate
.
He
ranged
far
and
wide
,
and
slept
but
little
in
*NL*
the
lair
that
had
now
become
cheerless
and
miserable
.
The
she-wolf
,
too
,
*NL*
left
her
litter
and
went
out
in
search
of
meat
.
In
the
first
days
after
*NL*
the
birth
of
the
cubs
,
One
Eye
had
journeyed
several
times
back
to
the
*NL*
Indian
camp
and
robbed
the
rabbit
snares
;
but
,
with
the
melting
of
the
*NL*
snow
and
the
opening
of
the
streams
,
the
Indian
camp
had
moved
away
,
and
*NL*
that
source
of
supply
was
closed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
grey
cub
came
back
to
life
and
again
took
interest
in
the
far
*NL*
white
wall
,
he
found
that
the
population
of
his
world
had
been
reduced
.
*NL*
Only
one
sister
remained
to
him
.
The
rest
were
gone
.
As
he
grew
*NL*
stronger
,
he
found
himself
compelled
to
play
alone
,
for
the
sister
no
*NL*
longer
lifted
her
head
nor
moved
about
.
His
little
body
rounded
out
with
*NL*
the
meat
he
now
ate
;
but
the
food
had
come
too
late
for
her
.
She
slept
*NL*
continuously
,
a
tiny
skeleton
flung
round
with
skin
in
which
the
flame
*NL*
flickered
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
came
a
time
when
the
grey
cub
no
longer
saw
his
father
*NL*
appearing
and
disappearing
in
the
wall
nor
lying
down
asleep
in
the
*NL*
entrance
.
This
had
happened
at
the
end
of
a
second
and
less
severe
*NL*
famine
.
The
she-wolf
knew
why
One
Eye
never
came
back
,
but
there
was
no
*NL*
way
by
which
she
could
tell
what
she
had
seen
to
the
grey
cub
.
Hunting
*NL*
herself
for
meat
,
up
the
left
fork
of
the
stream
where
lived
the
lynx
,
*NL*
she
had
followed
a
day-old
trail
of
One
Eye
.
And
she
had
found
him
,
or
*NL*
what
remained
of
him
,
at
the
end
of
the
trail
.
There
were
many
signs
of
*NL*
the
battle
that
had
been
fought
,
and
of
the
lynx
's
withdrawal
to
her
lair
*NL*
after
having
won
the
victory
.
Before
she
went
away
,
the
she-wolf
had
*NL*
found
this
lair
,
but
the
signs
told
her
that
the
lynx
was
inside
,
and
she
*NL*
had
not
dared
to
venture
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
the
she-wolf
in
her
hunting
avoided
the
left
fork
.
For
she
*NL*
knew
that
in
the
lynx
's
lair
was
a
litter
of
kittens
,
and
she
knew
the
*NL*
lynx
for
a
fierce
,
bad-tempered
creature
and
a
terrible
fighter
.
It
was
*NL*
all
very
well
for
half
a
dozen
wolves
to
drive
a
lynx
,
spitting
and
*NL*
bristling
,
up
a
tree
;
but
it
was
quite
a
different
matter
for
a
lone
wolf
*NL*
to
encounter
a
lynx
--
especially
when
the
lynx
was
known
to
have
a
litter
*NL*
of
hungry
kittens
at
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Wild
is
the
Wild
,
and
motherhood
is
motherhood
,
at
all
times
*NL*
fiercely
protective
whether
in
the
Wild
or
out
of
it
;
and
the
time
was
to
*NL*
come
when
the
she-wolf
,
for
her
grey
cub
's
sake
,
would
venture
the
left
*NL*
fork
,
and
the
lair
in
the
rocks
,
and
the
lynx
's
wrath
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
WALL
OF
THE
WORLD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
his
mother
began
leaving
the
cave
on
hunting
expeditions
,
the
*NL*
cub
had
learned
well
the
law
that
forbade
his
approaching
the
entrance
.
*NL*
Not
only
had
this
law
been
forcibly
and
many
times
impressed
on
him
by
*NL*
his
mother
's
nose
and
paw
,
but
in
him
the
instinct
of
fear
was
*NL*
developing
.
Never
,
in
his
brief
cave-life
,
had
he
encountered
anything
*NL*
of
which
to
be
afraid
.
Yet
fear
was
in
him
.
It
had
come
down
to
him
*NL*
from
a
remote
ancestry
through
a
thousand
thousand
lives
.
It
was
a
*NL*
heritage
he
had
received
directly
from
One
Eye
and
the
she-wolf
;
but
to
*NL*
them
,
in
turn
,
it
had
been
passed
down
through
all
the
generations
of
*NL*
wolves
that
had
gone
before
.
Fear
!
--
that
legacy
of
the
Wild
which
no
*NL*
animal
may
escape
nor
exchange
for
pottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
grey
cub
knew
fear
,
though
he
knew
not
the
stuff
of
which
fear
was
*NL*
made
.
Possibly
he
accepted
it
as
one
of
the
restrictions
of
life
.
For
*NL*
he
had
already
learned
that
there
were
such
restrictions
.
Hunger
he
had
*NL*
known
;
and
when
he
could
not
appease
his
hunger
he
had
felt
restriction
.
*NL*
The
hard
obstruction
of
the
cave-wall
,
the
sharp
nudge
of
his
mother
's
*NL*
nose
,
the
smashing
stroke
of
her
paw
,
the
hunger
unappeased
of
several
*NL*
famines
,
had
borne
in
upon
him
that
all
was
not
freedom
in
the
world
,
*NL*
that
to
life
there
were
limitations
and
restraints
.
These
limitations
and
*NL*
restraints
were
laws
.
To
be
obedient
to
them
was
to
escape
hurt
and
make
*NL*
for
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
reason
the
question
out
in
this
man
fashion
.
He
merely
*NL*
classified
the
things
that
hurt
and
the
things
that
did
not
hurt
.
And
*NL*
after
such
classification
he
avoided
the
things
that
hurt
,
the
*NL*
restrictions
and
restraints
,
in
order
to
enjoy
the
satisfactions
and
the
*NL*
remunerations
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
was
that
in
obedience
to
the
law
laid
down
by
his
mother
,
and
in
*NL*
obedience
to
the
law
of
that
unknown
and
nameless
thing
,
fear
,
he
kept
*NL*
away
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
.
It
remained
to
him
a
white
wall
of
*NL*
light
.
When
his
mother
was
absent
,
he
slept
most
of
the
time
,
while
*NL*
during
the
intervals
that
he
was
awake
he
kept
very
quiet
,
suppressing
*NL*
the
whimpering
cries
that
tickled
in
his
throat
and
strove
for
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
lying
awake
,
he
heard
a
strange
sound
in
the
white
wall
.
He
did
*NL*
not
know
that
it
was
a
wolverine
,
standing
outside
,
all
a-trembling
with
*NL*
its
own
daring
,
and
cautiously
scenting
out
the
contents
of
the
cave
.
The
*NL*
cub
knew
only
that
the
sniff
was
strange
,
a
something
unclassified
,
*NL*
therefore
unknown
and
terrible
--
for
the
unknown
was
one
of
the
chief
*NL*
elements
that
went
into
the
making
of
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hair
bristled
upon
the
grey
cub
's
back
,
but
it
bristled
silently
.
How
*NL*
was
he
to
know
that
this
thing
that
sniffed
was
a
thing
at
which
to
*NL*
bristle
?
It
was
not
born
of
any
knowledge
of
his
,
yet
it
was
the
visible
*NL*
expression
of
the
fear
that
was
in
him
,
and
for
which
,
in
his
own
life
,
*NL*
there
was
no
accounting
.
But
fear
was
accompanied
by
another
*NL*
instinct
--
that
of
concealment
.
The
cub
was
in
a
frenzy
of
terror
,
yet
he
*NL*
lay
without
movement
or
sound
,
frozen
,
petrified
into
immobility
,
to
all
*NL*
appearances
dead
.
His
mother
,
coming
home
,
growled
as
she
smelt
the
*NL*
wolverine
's
track
,
and
bounded
into
the
cave
and
licked
and
nozzled
him
*NL*
with
undue
vehemence
of
affection
.
And
the
cub
felt
that
somehow
he
had
*NL*
escaped
a
great
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
were
other
forces
at
work
in
the
cub
,
the
greatest
of
which
was
*NL*
growth
.
Instinct
and
law
demanded
of
him
obedience
.
But
growth
demanded
*NL*
disobedience
.
His
mother
and
fear
impelled
him
to
keep
away
from
the
*NL*
white
wall
.
Growth
is
life
,
and
life
is
for
ever
destined
to
make
for
*NL*
light
.
So
there
was
no
damming
up
the
tide
of
life
that
was
rising
*NL*
within
him
--
rising
with
every
mouthful
of
meat
he
swallowed
,
with
every
*NL*
breath
he
drew
.
In
the
end
,
one
day
,
fear
and
obedience
were
swept
away
*NL*
by
the
rush
of
life
,
and
the
cub
straddled
and
sprawled
toward
the
*NL*
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unlike
any
other
wall
with
which
he
had
had
experience
,
this
wall
seemed
*NL*
to
recede
from
him
as
he
approached
.
No
hard
surface
collided
with
the
*NL*
tender
little
nose
he
thrust
out
tentatively
before
him
.
The
substance
*NL*
of
the
wall
seemed
as
permeable
and
yielding
as
light
.
And
as
condition
,
*NL*
in
his
eyes
,
had
the
seeming
of
form
,
so
he
entered
into
what
had
been
*NL*
wall
to
him
and
bathed
in
the
substance
that
composed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
bewildering
.
He
was
sprawling
through
solidity
.
And
ever
the
*NL*
light
grew
brighter
.
Fear
urged
him
to
go
back
,
but
growth
drove
him
on
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
found
himself
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
.
The
wall
,
inside
*NL*
which
he
had
thought
himself
,
as
suddenly
leaped
back
before
him
to
an
*NL*
immeasurable
distance
.
The
light
had
become
painfully
bright
.
He
was
*NL*
dazzled
by
it
.
Likewise
he
was
made
dizzy
by
this
abrupt
and
tremendous
*NL*
extension
of
space
.
Automatically
,
his
eyes
were
adjusting
themselves
to
*NL*
the
brightness
,
focusing
themselves
to
meet
the
increased
distance
of
*NL*
objects
.
At
first
,
the
wall
had
leaped
beyond
his
vision
.
He
now
saw
it
*NL*
again
;
but
it
had
taken
upon
itself
a
remarkable
remoteness
.
Also
,
its
*NL*
appearance
had
changed
.
It
was
now
a
variegated
wall
,
composed
of
the
*NL*
trees
that
fringed
the
stream
,
the
opposing
mountain
that
towered
above
*NL*
the
trees
,
and
the
sky
that
out-towered
the
mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
fear
came
upon
him
.
This
was
more
of
the
terrible
unknown
.
He
*NL*
crouched
down
on
the
lip
of
the
cave
and
gazed
out
on
the
world
.
He
was
*NL*
very
much
afraid
.
Because
it
was
unknown
,
it
was
hostile
to
him
.
*NL*
Therefore
the
hair
stood
up
on
end
along
his
back
and
his
lips
wrinkled
*NL*
weakly
in
an
attempt
at
a
ferocious
and
intimidating
snarl
.
Out
of
his
*NL*
puniness
and
fright
he
challenged
and
menaced
the
whole
wide
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
happened
.
He
continued
to
gaze
,
and
in
his
interest
he
forgot
to
*NL*
snarl
.
Also
,
he
forgot
to
be
afraid
.
For
the
time
,
fear
had
been
routed
*NL*
by
growth
,
while
growth
had
assumed
the
guise
of
curiosity
.
He
began
to
*NL*
notice
near
objects
--
an
open
portion
of
the
stream
that
flashed
in
the
*NL*
sun
,
the
blasted
pine-tree
that
stood
at
the
base
of
the
slope
,
and
the
*NL*
slope
itself
,
that
ran
right
up
to
him
and
ceased
two
feet
beneath
the
*NL*
lip
of
the
cave
on
which
he
crouched
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
grey
cub
had
lived
all
his
days
on
a
level
floor
.
He
had
never
*NL*
experienced
the
hurt
of
a
fall
.
He
did
not
know
what
a
fall
was
.
So
he
*NL*
stepped
boldly
out
upon
the
air
.
His
hind-legs
still
rested
on
the
cave
-
*NL*
lip
,
so
he
fell
forward
head
downward
.
The
earth
struck
him
a
harsh
blow
*NL*
on
the
nose
that
made
him
yelp
.
Then
he
began
rolling
down
the
slope
,
*NL*
over
and
over
.
He
was
in
a
panic
of
terror
.
The
unknown
had
caught
him
*NL*
at
last
.
It
had
gripped
savagely
hold
of
him
and
was
about
to
wreak
upon
*NL*
him
some
terrific
hurt
.
Growth
was
now
routed
by
fear
,
and
he
ki-yi
'd
*NL*
like
any
frightened
puppy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unknown
bore
him
on
he
knew
not
to
what
frightful
hurt
,
and
he
yelped
*NL*
and
ki-yi
'd
unceasingly
.
This
was
a
different
proposition
from
crouching
*NL*
in
frozen
fear
while
the
unknown
lurked
just
alongside
.
Now
the
unknown
*NL*
had
caught
tight
hold
of
him
.
Silence
would
do
no
good
.
Besides
,
it
was
*NL*
not
fear
,
but
terror
,
that
convulsed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
slope
grew
more
gradual
,
and
its
base
was
grass-covered
.
Here
*NL*
the
cub
lost
momentum
.
When
at
last
he
came
to
a
stop
,
he
gave
one
last
*NL*
agonised
yell
and
then
a
long
,
whimpering
wail
.
Also
,
and
quite
as
a
*NL*
matter
of
course
,
as
though
in
his
life
he
had
already
made
a
thousand
*NL*
toilets
,
he
proceeded
to
lick
away
the
dry
clay
that
soiled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
he
sat
up
and
gazed
about
him
,
as
might
the
first
man
of
the
*NL*
earth
who
landed
upon
Mars
.
The
cub
had
broken
through
the
wall
of
the
*NL*
world
,
the
unknown
had
let
go
its
hold
of
him
,
and
here
he
was
without
*NL*
hurt
.
But
the
first
man
on
Mars
would
have
experienced
less
*NL*
unfamiliarity
than
did
he
.
Without
any
antecedent
knowledge
,
without
any
*NL*
warning
whatever
that
such
existed
,
he
found
himself
an
explorer
in
a
*NL*
totally
new
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
the
terrible
unknown
had
let
go
of
him
,
he
forgot
that
the
*NL*
unknown
had
any
terrors
.
He
was
aware
only
of
curiosity
in
all
the
*NL*
things
about
him
.
He
inspected
the
grass
beneath
him
,
the
moss-berry
*NL*
plant
just
beyond
,
and
the
dead
trunk
of
the
blasted
pine
that
stood
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
an
open
space
among
the
trees
.
A
squirrel
,
running
around
*NL*
the
base
of
the
trunk
,
came
full
upon
him
,
and
gave
him
a
great
fright
.
*NL*
He
cowered
down
and
snarled
.
But
the
squirrel
was
as
badly
scared
.
It
*NL*
ran
up
the
tree
,
and
from
a
point
of
safety
chattered
back
savagely
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
helped
the
cub
's
courage
,
and
though
the
woodpecker
he
next
*NL*
encountered
gave
him
a
start
,
he
proceeded
confidently
on
his
way
.
Such
*NL*
was
his
confidence
,
that
when
a
moose-bird
impudently
hopped
up
to
him
,
*NL*
he
reached
out
at
it
with
a
playful
paw
.
The
result
was
a
sharp
peck
on
*NL*
the
end
of
his
nose
that
made
him
cower
down
and
ki-yi
.
The
noise
he
*NL*
made
was
too
much
for
the
moose-bird
,
who
sought
safety
in
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
cub
was
learning
.
His
misty
little
mind
had
already
made
an
*NL*
unconscious
classification
.
There
were
live
things
and
things
not
alive
.
*NL*
Also
,
he
must
watch
out
for
the
live
things
.
The
things
not
alive
*NL*
remained
always
in
one
place
,
but
the
live
things
moved
about
,
and
there
*NL*
was
no
telling
what
they
might
do
.
The
thing
to
expect
of
them
was
the
*NL*
unexpected
,
and
for
this
he
must
be
prepared
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
travelled
very
clumsily
.
He
ran
into
sticks
and
things
.
A
twig
that
*NL*
he
thought
a
long
way
off
,
would
the
next
instant
hit
him
on
the
nose
or
*NL*
rake
along
his
ribs
.
There
were
inequalities
of
surface
.
Sometimes
he
*NL*
overstepped
and
stubbed
his
nose
.
Quite
as
often
he
understepped
and
*NL*
stubbed
his
feet
.
Then
there
were
the
pebbles
and
stones
that
turned
*NL*
under
him
when
he
trod
upon
them
;
and
from
them
he
came
to
know
that
the
*NL*
things
not
alive
were
not
all
in
the
same
state
of
stable
equilibrium
as
*NL*
was
his
cave
--
also
,
that
small
things
not
alive
were
more
liable
than
*NL*
large
things
to
fall
down
or
turn
over
.
But
with
every
mishap
he
was
*NL*
learning
.
The
longer
he
walked
,
the
better
he
walked
.
He
was
adjusting
*NL*
himself
.
He
was
learning
to
calculate
his
own
muscular
movements
,
to
*NL*
know
his
physical
limitations
,
to
measure
distances
between
objects
,
and
*NL*
between
objects
and
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
was
the
luck
of
the
beginner
.
Born
to
be
a
hunter
of
meat
-LRB-
though
he
*NL*
did
not
know
it
-RRB-
,
he
blundered
upon
meat
just
outside
his
own
cave-door
*NL*
on
his
first
foray
into
the
world
.
It
was
by
sheer
blundering
that
he
*NL*
chanced
upon
the
shrewdly
hidden
ptarmigan
nest
.
He
fell
into
it
.
He
*NL*
had
essayed
to
walk
along
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
pine
.
The
rotten
bark
*NL*
gave
way
under
his
feet
,
and
with
a
despairing
yelp
he
pitched
down
the
*NL*
rounded
crescent
,
smashed
through
the
leafage
and
stalks
of
a
small
bush
,
*NL*
and
in
the
heart
of
the
bush
,
on
the
ground
,
fetched
up
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
seven
ptarmigan
chicks
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
noises
,
and
at
first
he
was
frightened
at
them
.
Then
he
*NL*
perceived
that
they
were
very
little
,
and
he
became
bolder
.
They
moved
.
*NL*
He
placed
his
paw
on
one
,
and
its
movements
were
accelerated
.
This
was
a
*NL*
source
of
enjoyment
to
him
.
He
smelled
it
.
He
picked
it
up
in
his
*NL*
mouth
.
It
struggled
and
tickled
his
tongue
.
At
the
same
time
he
was
*NL*
made
aware
of
a
sensation
of
hunger
.
His
jaws
closed
together
.
There
*NL*
was
a
crunching
of
fragile
bones
,
and
warm
blood
ran
in
his
mouth
.
The
*NL*
taste
of
it
was
good
.
This
was
meat
,
the
same
as
his
mother
gave
him
,
*NL*
only
it
was
alive
between
his
teeth
and
therefore
better
.
So
he
ate
the
*NL*
ptarmigan
.
Nor
did
he
stop
till
he
had
devoured
the
whole
brood
.
Then
*NL*
he
licked
his
chops
in
quite
the
same
way
his
mother
did
,
and
began
to
*NL*
crawl
out
of
the
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
encountered
a
feathered
whirlwind
.
He
was
confused
and
blinded
by
the
*NL*
rush
of
it
and
the
beat
of
angry
wings
.
He
hid
his
head
between
his
paws
*NL*
and
yelped
.
The
blows
increased
.
The
mother
ptarmigan
was
in
a
fury
.
*NL*
Then
he
became
angry
.
He
rose
up
,
snarling
,
striking
out
with
his
paws
.
*NL*
He
sank
his
tiny
teeth
into
one
of
the
wings
and
pulled
and
tugged
*NL*
sturdily
.
The
ptarmigan
struggled
against
him
,
showering
blows
upon
him
*NL*
with
her
free
wing
.
It
was
his
first
battle
.
He
was
elated
.
He
forgot
*NL*
all
about
the
unknown
.
He
no
longer
was
afraid
of
anything
.
He
was
*NL*
fighting
,
tearing
at
a
live
thing
that
was
striking
at
him
.
Also
,
this
*NL*
live
thing
was
meat
.
The
lust
to
kill
was
on
him
.
He
had
just
destroyed
*NL*
little
live
things
.
He
would
now
destroy
a
big
live
thing
.
He
was
too
*NL*
busy
and
happy
to
know
that
he
was
happy
.
He
was
thrilling
and
exulting
*NL*
in
ways
new
to
him
and
greater
to
him
than
any
he
had
known
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
on
to
the
wing
and
growled
between
his
tight-clenched
teeth
.
The
*NL*
ptarmigan
dragged
him
out
of
the
bush
.
When
she
turned
and
tried
to
drag
*NL*
him
back
into
the
bush
's
shelter
,
he
pulled
her
away
from
it
and
on
into
*NL*
the
open
.
And
all
the
time
she
was
making
outcry
and
striking
with
her
*NL*
free
wing
,
while
feathers
were
flying
like
a
snow-fall
.
The
pitch
to
*NL*
which
he
was
aroused
was
tremendous
.
All
the
fighting
blood
of
his
breed
*NL*
was
up
in
him
and
surging
through
him
.
This
was
living
,
though
he
did
*NL*
not
know
it
.
He
was
realising
his
own
meaning
in
the
world
;
he
was
doing
*NL*
that
for
which
he
was
made
--
killing
meat
and
battling
to
kill
it
.
He
was
*NL*
justifying
his
existence
,
than
which
life
can
do
no
greater
;
for
life
*NL*
achieves
its
summit
when
it
does
to
the
uttermost
that
which
it
was
*NL*
equipped
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
,
the
ptarmigan
ceased
her
struggling
.
He
still
held
her
by
*NL*
the
wing
,
and
they
lay
on
the
ground
and
looked
at
each
other
.
He
tried
*NL*
to
growl
threateningly
,
ferociously
.
She
pecked
on
his
nose
,
which
by
*NL*
now
,
what
of
previous
adventures
was
sore
.
He
winced
but
held
on
.
She
*NL*
pecked
him
again
and
again
.
From
wincing
he
went
to
whimpering
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
back
away
from
her
,
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
by
his
hold
on
*NL*
her
he
dragged
her
after
him
.
A
rain
of
pecks
fell
on
his
ill-used
nose
.
*NL*
The
flood
of
fight
ebbed
down
in
him
,
and
,
releasing
his
prey
,
he
turned
*NL*
tail
and
scampered
on
across
the
open
in
inglorious
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
down
to
rest
on
the
other
side
of
the
open
,
near
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
bushes
,
his
tongue
lolling
out
,
his
chest
heaving
and
panting
,
his
nose
*NL*
still
hurting
him
and
causing
him
to
continue
his
whimper
.
But
as
he
lay
*NL*
there
,
suddenly
there
came
to
him
a
feeling
as
of
something
terrible
*NL*
impending
.
The
unknown
with
all
its
terrors
rushed
upon
him
,
and
he
*NL*
shrank
back
instinctively
into
the
shelter
of
the
bush
.
As
he
did
so
,
a
*NL*
draught
of
air
fanned
him
,
and
a
large
,
winged
body
swept
ominously
and
*NL*
silently
past
.
A
hawk
,
driving
down
out
of
the
blue
,
had
barely
missed
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
lay
in
the
bush
,
recovering
from
his
fright
and
peering
*NL*
fearfully
out
,
the
mother-ptarmigan
on
the
other
side
of
the
open
space
*NL*
fluttered
out
of
the
ravaged
nest
.
It
was
because
of
her
loss
that
she
*NL*
paid
no
attention
to
the
winged
bolt
of
the
sky
.
But
the
cub
saw
,
and
it
*NL*
was
a
warning
and
a
lesson
to
him
--
the
swift
downward
swoop
of
the
hawk
,
*NL*
the
short
skim
of
its
body
just
above
the
ground
,
the
strike
of
its
*NL*
talons
in
the
body
of
the
ptarmigan
,
the
ptarmigan
's
squawk
of
agony
and
*NL*
fright
,
and
the
hawk
's
rush
upward
into
the
blue
,
carrying
the
ptarmigan
*NL*
away
with
it
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
time
before
the
cub
left
its
shelter
.
He
had
learned
much
.
*NL*
Live
things
were
meat
.
They
were
good
to
eat
.
Also
,
live
things
when
*NL*
they
were
large
enough
,
could
give
hurt
.
It
was
better
to
eat
small
live
*NL*
things
like
ptarmigan
chicks
,
and
to
let
alone
large
live
things
like
*NL*
ptarmigan
hens
.
Nevertheless
he
felt
a
little
prick
of
ambition
,
a
*NL*
sneaking
desire
to
have
another
battle
with
that
ptarmigan
hen
--
only
the
*NL*
hawk
had
carried
her
away
.
Maybe
there
were
other
ptarmigan
hens
.
He
*NL*
would
go
and
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
down
a
shelving
bank
to
the
stream
.
He
had
never
seen
water
*NL*
before
.
The
footing
looked
good
.
There
were
no
inequalities
of
surface
.
*NL*
He
stepped
boldly
out
on
it
;
and
went
down
,
crying
with
fear
,
into
the
*NL*
embrace
of
the
unknown
.
It
was
cold
,
and
he
gasped
,
breathing
quickly
.
*NL*
The
water
rushed
into
his
lungs
instead
of
the
air
that
had
always
*NL*
accompanied
his
act
of
breathing
.
The
suffocation
he
experienced
was
*NL*
like
the
pang
of
death
.
To
him
it
signified
death
.
He
had
no
conscious
*NL*
knowledge
of
death
,
but
like
every
animal
of
the
Wild
,
he
possessed
the
*NL*
instinct
of
death
.
To
him
it
stood
as
the
greatest
of
hurts
.
It
was
the
*NL*
very
essence
of
the
unknown
;
it
was
the
sum
of
the
terrors
of
the
*NL*
unknown
,
the
one
culminating
and
unthinkable
catastrophe
that
could
*NL*
happen
to
him
,
about
which
he
knew
nothing
and
about
which
he
feared
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
the
surface
,
and
the
sweet
air
rushed
into
his
open
mouth
.
He
*NL*
did
not
go
down
again
.
Quite
as
though
it
had
been
a
long-established
*NL*
custom
of
his
he
struck
out
with
all
his
legs
and
began
to
swim
.
The
*NL*
near
bank
was
a
yard
away
;
but
he
had
come
up
with
his
back
to
it
,
and
*NL*
the
first
thing
his
eyes
rested
upon
was
the
opposite
bank
,
toward
which
*NL*
he
immediately
began
to
swim
.
The
stream
was
a
small
one
,
but
in
the
*NL*
pool
it
widened
out
to
a
score
of
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Midway
in
the
passage
,
the
current
picked
up
the
cub
and
swept
him
*NL*
downstream
.
He
was
caught
in
the
miniature
rapid
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
pool
.
Here
was
little
chance
for
swimming
.
The
quiet
water
had
become
*NL*
suddenly
angry
.
Sometimes
he
was
under
,
sometimes
on
top
.
At
all
times
*NL*
he
was
in
violent
motion
,
now
being
turned
over
or
around
,
and
again
,
*NL*
being
smashed
against
a
rock
.
And
with
every
rock
he
struck
,
he
yelped
.
*NL*
His
progress
was
a
series
of
yelps
,
from
which
might
have
been
adduced
*NL*
the
number
of
rocks
he
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Below
the
rapid
was
a
second
pool
,
and
here
,
captured
by
the
eddy
,
he
was
*NL*
gently
borne
to
the
bank
,
and
as
gently
deposited
on
a
bed
of
gravel
.
He
*NL*
crawled
frantically
clear
of
the
water
and
lay
down
.
He
had
learned
some
*NL*
more
about
the
world
.
Water
was
not
alive
.
Yet
it
moved
.
Also
,
it
*NL*
looked
as
solid
as
the
earth
,
but
was
without
any
solidity
at
all
.
His
*NL*
conclusion
was
that
things
were
not
always
what
they
appeared
to
be
.
The
*NL*
cub
's
fear
of
the
unknown
was
an
inherited
distrust
,
and
it
had
now
been
*NL*
strengthened
by
experience
.
Thenceforth
,
in
the
nature
of
things
,
he
*NL*
would
possess
an
abiding
distrust
of
appearances
.
He
would
have
to
learn
*NL*
the
reality
of
a
thing
before
he
could
put
his
faith
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
other
adventure
was
destined
for
him
that
day
.
He
had
recollected
*NL*
that
there
was
such
a
thing
in
the
world
as
his
mother
.
And
then
there
*NL*
came
to
him
a
feeling
that
he
wanted
her
more
than
all
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
things
in
the
world
.
Not
only
was
his
body
tired
with
the
adventures
it
*NL*
had
undergone
,
but
his
little
brain
was
equally
tired
.
In
all
the
days
*NL*
he
had
lived
it
had
not
worked
so
hard
as
on
this
one
day
.
Furthermore
,
*NL*
he
was
sleepy
.
So
he
started
out
to
look
for
the
cave
and
his
mother
,
*NL*
feeling
at
the
same
time
an
overwhelming
rush
of
loneliness
and
*NL*
helplessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sprawling
along
between
some
bushes
,
when
he
heard
a
sharp
*NL*
intimidating
cry
.
There
was
a
flash
of
yellow
before
his
eyes
.
He
saw
a
*NL*
weasel
leaping
swiftly
away
from
him
.
It
was
a
small
live
thing
,
and
he
*NL*
had
no
fear
.
Then
,
before
him
,
at
his
feet
,
he
saw
an
extremely
small
*NL*
live
thing
,
only
several
inches
long
,
a
young
weasel
,
that
,
like
himself
,
*NL*
had
disobediently
gone
out
adventuring
.
It
tried
to
retreat
before
him
.
*NL*
He
turned
it
over
with
his
paw
.
It
made
a
queer
,
grating
noise
.
The
*NL*
next
moment
the
flash
of
yellow
reappeared
before
his
eyes
.
He
heard
*NL*
again
the
intimidating
cry
,
and
at
the
same
instant
received
a
sharp
blow
*NL*
on
the
side
of
the
neck
and
felt
the
sharp
teeth
of
the
mother-weasel
cut
*NL*
into
his
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
yelped
and
ki-yi
'd
and
scrambled
backward
,
he
saw
the
mother
-
*NL*
weasel
leap
upon
her
young
one
and
disappear
with
it
into
the
*NL*
neighbouring
thicket
.
The
cut
of
her
teeth
in
his
neck
still
hurt
,
but
*NL*
his
feelings
were
hurt
more
grievously
,
and
he
sat
down
and
weakly
*NL*
whimpered
.
This
mother-weasel
was
so
small
and
so
savage
.
He
was
yet
to
*NL*
learn
that
for
size
and
weight
the
weasel
was
the
most
ferocious
,
*NL*
vindictive
,
and
terrible
of
all
the
killers
of
the
Wild
.
But
a
portion
*NL*
of
this
knowledge
was
quickly
to
be
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
whimpering
when
the
mother-weasel
reappeared
.
She
did
not
*NL*
rush
him
,
now
that
her
young
one
was
safe
.
She
approached
more
*NL*
cautiously
,
and
the
cub
had
full
opportunity
to
observe
her
lean
,
*NL*
snakelike
body
,
and
her
head
,
erect
,
eager
,
and
snake-like
itself
.
Her
*NL*
sharp
,
menacing
cry
sent
the
hair
bristling
along
his
back
,
and
he
*NL*
snarled
warningly
at
her
.
She
came
closer
and
closer
.
There
was
a
leap
,
*NL*
swifter
than
his
unpractised
sight
,
and
the
lean
,
yellow
body
disappeared
*NL*
for
a
moment
out
of
the
field
of
his
vision
.
The
next
moment
she
was
at
*NL*
his
throat
,
her
teeth
buried
in
his
hair
and
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
snarled
and
tried
to
fight
;
but
he
was
very
young
,
and
this
*NL*
was
only
his
first
day
in
the
world
,
and
his
snarl
became
a
whimper
,
his
*NL*
fight
a
struggle
to
escape
.
The
weasel
never
relaxed
her
hold
.
She
hung
*NL*
on
,
striving
to
press
down
with
her
teeth
to
the
great
vein
where
his
*NL*
life-blood
bubbled
.
The
weasel
was
a
drinker
of
blood
,
and
it
was
ever
*NL*
her
preference
to
drink
from
the
throat
of
life
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grey
cub
would
have
died
,
and
there
would
have
been
no
story
to
write
*NL*
about
him
,
had
not
the
she-wolf
come
bounding
through
the
bushes
.
The
*NL*
weasel
let
go
the
cub
and
flashed
at
the
she-wolf
's
throat
,
missing
,
but
*NL*
getting
a
hold
on
the
jaw
instead
.
The
she-wolf
flirted
her
head
like
*NL*
the
snap
of
a
whip
,
breaking
the
weasel
's
hold
and
flinging
it
high
in
*NL*
the
air
.
And
,
still
in
the
air
,
the
she-wolf
's
jaws
closed
on
the
lean
,
*NL*
yellow
body
,
and
the
weasel
knew
death
between
the
crunching
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cub
experienced
another
access
of
affection
on
the
part
of
his
*NL*
mother
.
Her
joy
at
finding
him
seemed
even
greater
than
his
joy
at
being
*NL*
found
.
She
nozzled
him
and
caressed
him
and
licked
the
cuts
made
in
him
*NL*
by
the
weasel
's
teeth
.
Then
,
between
them
,
mother
and
cub
,
they
ate
the
*NL*
blood-drinker
,
and
after
that
went
back
to
the
cave
and
slept
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
LAW
OF
MEAT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
cub
's
development
was
rapid
.
He
rested
for
two
days
,
and
then
*NL*
ventured
forth
from
the
cave
again
.
It
was
on
this
adventure
that
he
*NL*
found
the
young
weasel
whose
mother
he
had
helped
eat
,
and
he
saw
to
it
*NL*
that
the
young
weasel
went
the
way
of
its
mother
.
But
on
this
trip
he
*NL*
did
not
get
lost
.
When
he
grew
tired
,
he
found
his
way
back
to
the
cave
*NL*
and
slept
.
And
every
day
thereafter
found
him
out
and
ranging
a
wider
*NL*
area
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
get
accurate
measurement
of
his
strength
and
his
weakness
,
*NL*
and
to
know
when
to
be
bold
and
when
to
be
cautious
.
He
found
it
*NL*
expedient
to
be
cautious
all
the
time
,
except
for
the
rare
moments
,
when
,
*NL*
assured
of
his
own
intrepidity
,
he
abandoned
himself
to
petty
rages
and
*NL*
lusts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
always
a
little
demon
of
fury
when
he
chanced
upon
a
stray
*NL*
ptarmigan
.
Never
did
he
fail
to
respond
savagely
to
the
chatter
of
the
*NL*
squirrel
he
had
first
met
on
the
blasted
pine
.
While
the
sight
of
a
*NL*
moose-bird
almost
invariably
put
him
into
the
wildest
of
rages
;
for
he
*NL*
never
forgot
the
peck
on
the
nose
he
had
received
from
the
first
of
that
*NL*
ilk
he
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
were
times
when
even
a
moose-bird
failed
to
affect
him
,
and
*NL*
those
were
times
when
he
felt
himself
to
be
in
danger
from
some
other
*NL*
prowling
meat
hunter
.
He
never
forgot
the
hawk
,
and
its
moving
shadow
*NL*
always
sent
him
crouching
into
the
nearest
thicket
.
He
no
longer
*NL*
sprawled
and
straddled
,
and
already
he
was
developing
the
gait
of
his
*NL*
mother
,
slinking
and
furtive
,
apparently
without
exertion
,
yet
sliding
*NL*
along
with
a
swiftness
that
was
as
deceptive
as
it
was
imperceptible
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
matter
of
meat
,
his
luck
had
been
all
in
the
beginning
.
The
seven
*NL*
ptarmigan
chicks
and
the
baby
weasel
represented
the
sum
of
his
killings
.
*NL*
His
desire
to
kill
strengthened
with
the
days
,
and
he
cherished
hungry
*NL*
ambitions
for
the
squirrel
that
chattered
so
volubly
and
always
informed
*NL*
all
wild
creatures
that
the
wolf-cub
was
approaching
.
But
as
birds
flew
*NL*
in
the
air
,
squirrels
could
climb
trees
,
and
the
cub
could
only
try
to
*NL*
crawl
unobserved
upon
the
squirrel
when
it
was
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cub
entertained
a
great
respect
for
his
mother
.
She
could
get
meat
,
*NL*
and
she
never
failed
to
bring
him
his
share
.
Further
,
she
was
unafraid
*NL*
of
things
.
It
did
not
occur
to
him
that
this
fearlessness
was
founded
*NL*
upon
experience
and
knowledge
.
Its
effect
on
him
was
that
of
an
*NL*
impression
of
power
.
His
mother
represented
power
;
and
as
he
grew
older
*NL*
he
felt
this
power
in
the
sharper
admonishment
of
her
paw
;
while
the
*NL*
reproving
nudge
of
her
nose
gave
place
to
the
slash
of
her
fangs
.
For
*NL*
this
,
likewise
,
he
respected
his
mother
.
She
compelled
obedience
from
*NL*
him
,
and
the
older
he
grew
the
shorter
grew
her
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Famine
came
again
,
and
the
cub
with
clearer
consciousness
knew
once
more
*NL*
the
bite
of
hunger
.
The
she-wolf
ran
herself
thin
in
the
quest
for
meat
.
*NL*
She
rarely
slept
any
more
in
the
cave
,
spending
most
of
her
time
on
the
*NL*
meat-trail
,
and
spending
it
vainly
.
This
famine
was
not
a
long
one
,
but
*NL*
it
was
severe
while
it
lasted
.
The
cub
found
no
more
milk
in
his
*NL*
mother
's
breast
,
nor
did
he
get
one
mouthful
of
meat
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
,
he
had
hunted
in
play
,
for
the
sheer
joyousness
of
it
;
now
he
*NL*
hunted
in
deadly
earnestness
,
and
found
nothing
.
Yet
the
failure
of
it
*NL*
accelerated
his
development
.
He
studied
the
habits
of
the
squirrel
with
*NL*
greater
carefulness
,
and
strove
with
greater
craft
to
steal
upon
it
and
*NL*
surprise
it
.
He
studied
the
wood-mice
and
tried
to
dig
them
out
of
their
*NL*
burrows
;
and
he
learned
much
about
the
ways
of
moose-birds
and
*NL*
woodpeckers
.
And
there
came
a
day
when
the
hawk
's
shadow
did
not
drive
*NL*
him
crouching
into
the
bushes
.
He
had
grown
stronger
and
wiser
,
and
more
*NL*
confident
.
Also
,
he
was
desperate
.
So
he
sat
on
his
haunches
,
*NL*
conspicuously
in
an
open
space
,
and
challenged
the
hawk
down
out
of
the
*NL*
sky
.
For
he
knew
that
there
,
floating
in
the
blue
above
him
,
was
meat
,
*NL*
the
meat
his
stomach
yearned
after
so
insistently
.
But
the
hawk
refused
*NL*
to
come
down
and
give
battle
,
and
the
cub
crawled
away
into
a
thicket
and
*NL*
whimpered
his
disappointment
and
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
famine
broke
.
The
she-wolf
brought
home
meat
.
It
was
strange
meat
,
*NL*
different
from
any
she
had
ever
brought
before
.
It
was
a
lynx
kitten
,
*NL*
partly
grown
,
like
the
cub
,
but
not
so
large
.
And
it
was
all
for
him
.
*NL*
His
mother
had
satisfied
her
hunger
elsewhere
;
though
he
did
not
know
*NL*
that
it
was
the
rest
of
the
lynx
litter
that
had
gone
to
satisfy
her
.
Nor
*NL*
did
he
know
the
desperateness
of
her
deed
.
He
knew
only
that
the
velvet
-
*NL*
furred
kitten
was
meat
,
and
he
ate
and
waxed
happier
with
every
mouthful
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
full
stomach
conduces
to
inaction
,
and
the
cub
lay
in
the
cave
,
*NL*
sleeping
against
his
mother
's
side
.
He
was
aroused
by
her
snarling
.
*NL*
Never
had
he
heard
her
snarl
so
terribly
.
Possibly
in
her
whole
life
it
*NL*
was
the
most
terrible
snarl
she
ever
gave
.
There
was
reason
for
it
,
and
*NL*
none
knew
it
better
than
she
.
A
lynx
's
lair
is
not
despoiled
with
*NL*
impunity
.
In
the
full
glare
of
the
afternoon
light
,
crouching
in
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
cave
,
the
cub
saw
the
lynx-mother
.
The
hair
rippled
up
*NL*
along
his
back
at
the
sight
.
Here
was
fear
,
and
it
did
not
require
his
*NL*
instinct
to
tell
him
of
it
.
And
if
sight
alone
were
not
sufficient
,
the
*NL*
cry
of
rage
the
intruder
gave
,
beginning
with
a
snarl
and
rushing
*NL*
abruptly
upward
into
a
hoarse
screech
,
was
convincing
enough
in
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cub
felt
the
prod
of
the
life
that
was
in
him
,
and
stood
up
and
*NL*
snarled
valiantly
by
his
mother
's
side
.
But
she
thrust
him
ignominiously
*NL*
away
and
behind
her
.
Because
of
the
low-roofed
entrance
the
lynx
could
*NL*
not
leap
in
,
and
when
she
made
a
crawling
rush
of
it
the
she-wolf
sprang
*NL*
upon
her
and
pinned
her
down
.
The
cub
saw
little
of
the
battle
.
There
*NL*
was
a
tremendous
snarling
and
spitting
and
screeching
.
The
two
animals
*NL*
threshed
about
,
the
lynx
ripping
and
tearing
with
her
claws
and
using
her
*NL*
teeth
as
well
,
while
the
she-wolf
used
her
teeth
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
the
cub
sprang
in
and
sank
his
teeth
into
the
hind
leg
of
the
lynx
.
*NL*
He
clung
on
,
growling
savagely
.
Though
he
did
not
know
it
,
by
the
weight
*NL*
of
his
body
he
clogged
the
action
of
the
leg
and
thereby
saved
his
mother
*NL*
much
damage
.
A
change
in
the
battle
crushed
him
under
both
their
bodies
*NL*
and
wrenched
loose
his
hold
.
The
next
moment
the
two
mothers
separated
,
*NL*
and
,
before
they
rushed
together
again
,
the
lynx
lashed
out
at
the
cub
*NL*
with
a
huge
fore-paw
that
ripped
his
shoulder
open
to
the
bone
and
sent
*NL*
him
hurtling
sidewise
against
the
wall
.
Then
was
added
to
the
uproar
the
*NL*
cub
's
shrill
yelp
of
pain
and
fright
.
But
the
fight
lasted
so
long
that
*NL*
he
had
time
to
cry
himself
out
and
to
experience
a
second
burst
of
*NL*
courage
;
and
the
end
of
the
battle
found
him
again
clinging
to
a
hind-leg
*NL*
and
furiously
growling
between
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lynx
was
dead
.
But
the
she-wolf
was
very
weak
and
sick
.
At
first
*NL*
she
caressed
the
cub
and
licked
his
wounded
shoulder
;
but
the
blood
she
*NL*
had
lost
had
taken
with
it
her
strength
,
and
for
all
of
a
day
and
a
night
*NL*
she
lay
by
her
dead
foe
's
side
,
without
movement
,
scarcely
breathing
.
For
*NL*
a
week
she
never
left
the
cave
,
except
for
water
,
and
then
her
movements
*NL*
were
slow
and
painful
.
At
the
end
of
that
time
the
lynx
was
devoured
,
*NL*
while
the
she-wolf
's
wounds
had
healed
sufficiently
to
permit
her
to
take
*NL*
the
meat-trail
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cub
's
shoulder
was
stiff
and
sore
,
and
for
some
time
he
limped
from
*NL*
the
terrible
slash
he
had
received
.
But
the
world
now
seemed
changed
.
He
*NL*
went
about
in
it
with
greater
confidence
,
with
a
feeling
of
prowess
that
*NL*
had
not
been
his
in
the
days
before
the
battle
with
the
lynx
.
He
had
*NL*
looked
upon
life
in
a
more
ferocious
aspect
;
he
had
fought
;
he
had
buried
*NL*
his
teeth
in
the
flesh
of
a
foe
;
and
he
had
survived
.
And
because
of
all
*NL*
this
,
he
carried
himself
more
boldly
,
with
a
touch
of
defiance
that
was
*NL*
new
in
him
.
He
was
no
longer
afraid
of
minor
things
,
and
much
of
his
*NL*
timidity
had
vanished
,
though
the
unknown
never
ceased
to
press
upon
him
*NL*
with
its
mysteries
and
terrors
,
intangible
and
ever-menacing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
accompany
his
mother
on
the
meat-trail
,
and
he
saw
much
of
*NL*
the
killing
of
meat
and
began
to
play
his
part
in
it
.
And
in
his
own
dim
*NL*
way
he
learned
the
law
of
meat
.
There
were
two
kinds
of
life
--
his
own
*NL*
kind
and
the
other
kind
.
His
own
kind
included
his
mother
and
himself
.
*NL*
The
other
kind
included
all
live
things
that
moved
.
But
the
other
kind
*NL*
was
divided
.
One
portion
was
what
his
own
kind
killed
and
ate
.
This
*NL*
portion
was
composed
of
the
non-killers
and
the
small
killers
.
The
other
*NL*
portion
killed
and
ate
his
own
kind
,
or
was
killed
and
eaten
by
his
own
*NL*
kind
.
And
out
of
this
classification
arose
the
law
.
The
aim
of
life
was
*NL*
meat
.
Life
itself
was
meat
.
Life
lived
on
life
.
There
were
the
eaters
*NL*
and
the
eaten
.
The
law
was
:
EAT
OR
BE
EATEN
.
He
did
not
formulate
the
*NL*
law
in
clear
,
set
terms
and
moralise
about
it
.
He
did
not
even
think
the
*NL*
law
;
he
merely
lived
the
law
without
thinking
about
it
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
the
law
operating
around
him
on
every
side
.
He
had
eaten
the
*NL*
ptarmigan
chicks
.
The
hawk
had
eaten
the
ptarmigan-mother
.
The
hawk
*NL*
would
also
have
eaten
him
.
Later
,
when
he
had
grown
more
formidable
,
he
*NL*
wanted
to
eat
the
hawk
.
He
had
eaten
the
lynx
kitten
.
The
lynx-mother
*NL*
would
have
eaten
him
had
she
not
herself
been
killed
and
eaten
.
And
so
*NL*
it
went
.
The
law
was
being
lived
about
him
by
all
live
things
,
and
he
*NL*
himself
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
law
.
He
was
a
killer
.
His
only
food
*NL*
was
meat
,
live
meat
,
that
ran
away
swiftly
before
him
,
or
flew
into
the
*NL*
air
,
or
climbed
trees
,
or
hid
in
the
ground
,
or
faced
him
and
fought
with
*NL*
him
,
or
turned
the
tables
and
ran
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
cub
thought
in
man-fashion
,
he
might
have
epitomised
life
as
a
*NL*
voracious
appetite
and
the
world
as
a
place
wherein
ranged
a
multitude
of
*NL*
appetites
,
pursuing
and
being
pursued
,
hunting
and
being
hunted
,
eating
*NL*
and
being
eaten
,
all
in
blindness
and
confusion
,
with
violence
and
*NL*
disorder
,
a
chaos
of
gluttony
and
slaughter
,
ruled
over
by
chance
,
*NL*
merciless
,
planless
,
endless
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
cub
did
not
think
in
man-fashion
.
He
did
not
look
at
things
with
*NL*
wide
vision
.
He
was
single-purposed
,
and
entertained
but
one
thought
or
*NL*
desire
at
a
time
.
Besides
the
law
of
meat
,
there
were
a
myriad
other
and
*NL*
lesser
laws
for
him
to
learn
and
obey
.
The
world
was
filled
with
*NL*
surprise
.
The
stir
of
the
life
that
was
in
him
,
the
play
of
his
muscles
,
*NL*
was
an
unending
happiness
.
To
run
down
meat
was
to
experience
thrills
*NL*
and
elations
.
His
rages
and
battles
were
pleasures
.
Terror
itself
,
and
*NL*
the
mystery
of
the
unknown
,
led
to
his
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
were
easements
and
satisfactions
.
To
have
a
full
stomach
,
to
*NL*
doze
lazily
in
the
sunshine
--
such
things
were
remuneration
in
full
for
*NL*
his
ardours
and
toils
,
while
his
ardours
and
tolls
were
in
themselves
*NL*
self-remunerative
.
They
were
expressions
of
life
,
and
life
is
always
*NL*
happy
when
it
is
expressing
itself
.
So
the
cub
had
no
quarrel
with
his
*NL*
hostile
environment
.
He
was
very
much
alive
,
very
happy
,
and
very
proud
*NL*
of
himself
.

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
MAKERS
OF
FIRE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
cub
came
upon
it
suddenly
.
It
was
his
own
fault
.
He
had
been
*NL*
careless
.
He
had
left
the
cave
and
run
down
to
the
stream
to
drink
.
It
*NL*
might
have
been
that
he
took
no
notice
because
he
was
heavy
with
sleep
.
*NL*
-LRB-
He
had
been
out
all
night
on
the
meat-trail
,
and
had
but
just
then
*NL*
awakened
.
-RRB-
And
his
carelessness
might
have
been
due
to
the
familiarity
*NL*
of
the
trail
to
the
pool
.
He
had
travelled
it
often
,
and
nothing
had
*NL*
ever
happened
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
down
past
the
blasted
pine
,
crossed
the
open
space
,
and
trotted
*NL*
in
amongst
the
trees
.
Then
,
at
the
same
instant
,
he
saw
and
smelt
.
*NL*
Before
him
,
sitting
silently
on
their
haunches
,
were
five
live
things
,
*NL*
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
seen
before
.
It
was
his
first
glimpse
of
*NL*
mankind
.
But
at
the
sight
of
him
the
five
men
did
not
spring
to
their
*NL*
feet
,
nor
show
their
teeth
,
nor
snarl
.
They
did
not
move
,
but
sat
there
,
*NL*
silent
and
ominous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
the
cub
move
.
Every
instinct
of
his
nature
would
have
impelled
*NL*
him
to
dash
wildly
away
,
had
there
not
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
*NL*
arisen
in
him
another
and
counter
instinct
.
A
great
awe
descended
upon
*NL*
him
.
He
was
beaten
down
to
movelessness
by
an
overwhelming
sense
of
his
*NL*
own
weakness
and
littleness
.
Here
was
mastery
and
power
,
something
far
*NL*
and
away
beyond
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cub
had
never
seen
man
,
yet
the
instinct
concerning
man
was
his
.
In
*NL*
dim
ways
he
recognised
in
man
the
animal
that
had
fought
itself
to
*NL*
primacy
over
the
other
animals
of
the
Wild
.
Not
alone
out
of
his
own
*NL*
eyes
,
but
out
of
the
eyes
of
all
his
ancestors
was
the
cub
now
looking
*NL*
upon
man
--
out
of
eyes
that
had
circled
in
the
darkness
around
countless
*NL*
winter
camp-fires
,
that
had
peered
from
safe
distances
and
from
the
*NL*
hearts
of
thickets
at
the
strange
,
two-legged
animal
that
was
lord
over
*NL*
living
things
.
The
spell
of
the
cub
's
heritage
was
upon
him
,
the
fear
*NL*
and
the
respect
born
of
the
centuries
of
struggle
and
the
accumulated
*NL*
experience
of
the
generations
.
The
heritage
was
too
compelling
for
a
*NL*
wolf
that
was
only
a
cub
.
Had
he
been
full-grown
,
he
would
have
run
*NL*
away
.
As
it
was
,
he
cowered
down
in
a
paralysis
of
fear
,
already
half
*NL*
proffering
the
submission
that
his
kind
had
proffered
from
the
first
time
*NL*
a
wolf
came
in
to
sit
by
man
's
fire
and
be
made
warm
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
Indians
arose
and
walked
over
to
him
and
stooped
above
him
.
*NL*
The
cub
cowered
closer
to
the
ground
.
It
was
the
unknown
,
objectified
at
*NL*
last
,
in
concrete
flesh
and
blood
,
bending
over
him
and
reaching
down
to
*NL*
seize
hold
of
him
.
His
hair
bristled
involuntarily
;
his
lips
writhed
*NL*
back
and
his
little
fangs
were
bared
.
The
hand
,
poised
like
doom
above
*NL*
him
,
hesitated
,
and
the
man
spoke
laughing
,
''
_
Wabam
wabisca
ip
pit
tah
_
.
''
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Look
!
The
white
fangs
!
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
Indians
laughed
loudly
,
and
urged
the
man
on
to
pick
up
the
*NL*
cub
.
As
the
hand
descended
closer
and
closer
,
there
raged
within
the
cub
*NL*
a
battle
of
the
instincts
.
He
experienced
two
great
impulsions
--
to
yield
*NL*
and
to
fight
.
The
resulting
action
was
a
compromise
.
He
did
both
.
He
*NL*
yielded
till
the
hand
almost
touched
him
.
Then
he
fought
,
his
teeth
*NL*
flashing
in
a
snap
that
sank
them
into
the
hand
.
The
next
moment
he
*NL*
received
a
clout
alongside
the
head
that
knocked
him
over
on
his
side
.
*NL*
Then
all
fight
fled
out
of
him
.
His
puppyhood
and
the
instinct
of
*NL*
submission
took
charge
of
him
.
He
sat
up
on
his
haunches
and
ki-yi
'd
.
*NL*
But
the
man
whose
hand
he
had
bitten
was
angry
.
The
cub
received
a
clout
*NL*
on
the
other
side
of
his
head
.
Whereupon
he
sat
up
and
ki-yi
'd
louder
*NL*
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
Indians
laughed
more
loudly
,
while
even
the
man
who
had
been
*NL*
bitten
began
to
laugh
.
They
surrounded
the
cub
and
laughed
at
him
,
while
*NL*
he
wailed
out
his
terror
and
his
hurt
.
In
the
midst
of
it
,
he
heard
*NL*
something
.
The
Indians
heard
it
too
.
But
the
cub
knew
what
it
was
,
and
*NL*
with
a
last
,
long
wail
that
had
in
it
more
of
triumph
than
grief
,
he
*NL*
ceased
his
noise
and
waited
for
the
coming
of
his
mother
,
of
his
*NL*
ferocious
and
indomitable
mother
who
fought
and
killed
all
things
and
was
*NL*
never
afraid
.
She
was
snarling
as
she
ran
.
She
had
heard
the
cry
of
her
*NL*
cub
and
was
dashing
to
save
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bounded
in
amongst
them
,
her
anxious
and
militant
motherhood
making
*NL*
her
anything
but
a
pretty
sight
.
But
to
the
cub
the
spectacle
of
her
*NL*
protective
rage
was
pleasing
.
He
uttered
a
glad
little
cry
and
bounded
*NL*
to
meet
her
,
while
the
man-animals
went
back
hastily
several
steps
.
The
*NL*
she-wolf
stood
over
against
her
cub
,
facing
the
men
,
with
bristling
hair
,
*NL*
a
snarl
rumbling
deep
in
her
throat
.
Her
face
was
distorted
and
*NL*
malignant
with
menace
,
even
the
bridge
of
the
nose
wrinkling
from
tip
to
*NL*
eyes
so
prodigious
was
her
snarl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
that
a
cry
went
up
from
one
of
the
men
.
``
Kiche
!
''
was
what
he
*NL*
uttered
.
It
was
an
exclamation
of
surprise
.
The
cub
felt
his
mother
*NL*
wilting
at
the
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kiche
!
''
the
man
cried
again
,
this
time
with
sharpness
and
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
cub
saw
his
mother
,
the
she-wolf
,
the
fearless
one
,
*NL*
crouching
down
till
her
belly
touched
the
ground
,
whimpering
,
wagging
her
*NL*
tail
,
making
peace
signs
.
The
cub
could
not
understand
.
He
was
*NL*
appalled
.
The
awe
of
man
rushed
over
him
again
.
His
instinct
had
been
*NL*
true
.
His
mother
verified
it
.
She
,
too
,
rendered
submission
to
the
man
-
*NL*
animals
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
had
spoken
came
over
to
her
.
He
put
his
hand
upon
her
head
,
*NL*
and
she
only
crouched
closer
.
She
did
not
snap
,
nor
threaten
to
snap
.
*NL*
The
other
men
came
up
,
and
surrounded
her
,
and
felt
her
,
and
pawed
her
,
*NL*
which
actions
she
made
no
attempt
to
resent
.
They
were
greatly
excited
,
*NL*
and
made
many
noises
with
their
mouths
.
These
noises
were
not
indication
*NL*
of
danger
,
the
cub
decided
,
as
he
crouched
near
his
mother
still
*NL*
bristling
from
time
to
time
but
doing
his
best
to
submit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
strange
,
''
an
Indian
was
saying
.
``
Her
father
was
a
wolf
.
It
*NL*
is
true
,
her
mother
was
a
dog
;
but
did
not
my
brother
tie
her
out
in
the
*NL*
woods
all
of
three
nights
in
the
mating
season
?
Therefore
was
the
father
*NL*
of
Kiche
a
wolf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
year
,
Grey
Beaver
,
since
she
ran
away
,
''
spoke
a
second
Indian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
strange
,
Salmon
Tongue
,
''
Grey
Beaver
answered
.
``
It
was
the
*NL*
time
of
the
famine
,
and
there
was
no
meat
for
the
dogs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
lived
with
the
wolves
,
''
said
a
third
Indian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
would
seem
,
Three
Eagles
,
''
Grey
Beaver
answered
,
laying
his
hand
*NL*
on
the
cub
;
``
and
this
be
the
sign
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cub
snarled
a
little
at
the
touch
of
the
hand
,
and
the
hand
flew
back
*NL*
to
administer
a
clout
.
Whereupon
the
cub
covered
its
fangs
,
and
sank
*NL*
down
submissively
,
while
the
hand
,
returning
,
rubbed
behind
his
ears
,
and
*NL*
up
and
down
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
be
the
sign
of
it
,
''
Grey
Beaver
went
on
.
``
It
is
plain
that
his
*NL*
mother
is
Kiche
.
But
his
father
was
a
wolf
.
Wherefore
is
there
in
him
*NL*
little
dog
and
much
wolf
.
His
fangs
be
white
,
and
White
Fang
shall
be
*NL*
his
name
.
I
have
spoken
.
He
is
my
dog
.
For
was
not
Kiche
my
brother
's
*NL*
dog
?
And
is
not
my
brother
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cub
,
who
had
thus
received
a
name
in
the
world
,
lay
and
watched
.
For
*NL*
a
time
the
man-animals
continued
to
make
their
mouth-noises
.
Then
Grey
*NL*
Beaver
took
a
knife
from
a
sheath
that
hung
around
his
neck
,
and
went
*NL*
into
the
thicket
and
cut
a
stick
.
White
Fang
watched
him
.
He
notched
*NL*
the
stick
at
each
end
and
in
the
notches
fastened
strings
of
raw-hide
.
*NL*
One
string
he
tied
around
the
throat
of
Kiche
.
Then
he
led
her
to
a
*NL*
small
pine
,
around
which
he
tied
the
other
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
followed
and
lay
down
beside
her
.
Salmon
Tongue
's
hand
*NL*
reached
out
to
him
and
rolled
him
over
on
his
back
.
Kiche
looked
on
*NL*
anxiously
.
White
Fang
felt
fear
mounting
in
him
again
.
He
could
not
*NL*
quite
suppress
a
snarl
,
but
he
made
no
offer
to
snap
.
The
hand
,
with
*NL*
fingers
crooked
and
spread
apart
,
rubbed
his
stomach
in
a
playful
way
and
*NL*
rolled
him
from
side
to
side
.
It
was
ridiculous
and
ungainly
,
lying
*NL*
there
on
his
back
with
legs
sprawling
in
the
air
.
Besides
,
it
was
a
*NL*
position
of
such
utter
helplessness
that
White
Fang
's
whole
nature
*NL*
revolted
against
it
.
He
could
do
nothing
to
defend
himself
.
If
this
man
-
*NL*
animal
intended
harm
,
White
Fang
knew
that
he
could
not
escape
it
.
How
*NL*
could
he
spring
away
with
his
four
legs
in
the
air
above
him
?
Yet
*NL*
submission
made
him
master
his
fear
,
and
he
only
growled
softly
.
This
*NL*
growl
he
could
not
suppress
;
nor
did
the
man-animal
resent
it
by
giving
*NL*
him
a
blow
on
the
head
.
And
furthermore
,
such
was
the
strangeness
of
it
,
*NL*
White
Fang
experienced
an
unaccountable
sensation
of
pleasure
as
the
hand
*NL*
rubbed
back
and
forth
.
When
he
was
rolled
on
his
side
he
ceased
to
*NL*
growl
,
when
the
fingers
pressed
and
prodded
at
the
base
of
his
ears
the
*NL*
pleasurable
sensation
increased
;
and
when
,
with
a
final
rub
and
scratch
,
*NL*
the
man
left
him
alone
and
went
away
,
all
fear
had
died
out
of
White
*NL*
Fang
.
He
was
to
know
fear
many
times
in
his
dealing
with
man
;
yet
it
was
*NL*
a
token
of
the
fearless
companionship
with
man
that
was
ultimately
to
be
*NL*
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
,
White
Fang
heard
strange
noises
approaching
.
He
was
quick
*NL*
in
his
classification
,
for
he
knew
them
at
once
for
man-animal
noises
.
A
*NL*
few
minutes
later
the
remainder
of
the
tribe
,
strung
out
as
it
was
on
the
*NL*
march
,
trailed
in
.
There
were
more
men
and
many
women
and
children
,
*NL*
forty
souls
of
them
,
and
all
heavily
burdened
with
camp
equipage
and
*NL*
outfit
.
Also
there
were
many
dogs
;
and
these
,
with
the
exception
of
the
*NL*
part-grown
puppies
,
were
likewise
burdened
with
camp
outfit
.
On
their
*NL*
backs
,
in
bags
that
fastened
tightly
around
underneath
,
the
dogs
carried
*NL*
from
twenty
to
thirty
pounds
of
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
had
never
seen
dogs
before
,
but
at
sight
of
them
he
felt
that
*NL*
they
were
his
own
kind
,
only
somehow
different
.
But
they
displayed
*NL*
little
difference
from
the
wolf
when
they
discovered
the
cub
and
his
*NL*
mother
.
There
was
a
rush
.
White
Fang
bristled
and
snarled
and
snapped
*NL*
in
the
face
of
the
open-mouthed
oncoming
wave
of
dogs
,
and
went
down
and
*NL*
under
them
,
feeling
the
sharp
slash
of
teeth
in
his
body
,
himself
biting
*NL*
and
tearing
at
the
legs
and
bellies
above
him
.
There
was
a
great
uproar
.
*NL*
He
could
hear
the
snarl
of
Kiche
as
she
fought
for
him
;
and
he
could
hear
*NL*
the
cries
of
the
man-animals
,
the
sound
of
clubs
striking
upon
bodies
,
*NL*
and
the
yelps
of
pain
from
the
dogs
so
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
a
few
seconds
elapsed
before
he
was
on
his
feet
again
.
He
could
now
*NL*
see
the
man-animals
driving
back
the
dogs
with
clubs
and
stones
,
*NL*
defending
him
,
saving
him
from
the
savage
teeth
of
his
kind
that
somehow
*NL*
was
not
his
kind
.
And
though
there
was
no
reason
in
his
brain
for
a
*NL*
clear
conception
of
so
abstract
a
thing
as
justice
,
nevertheless
,
in
his
*NL*
own
way
,
he
felt
the
justice
of
the
man-animals
,
and
he
knew
them
for
*NL*
what
they
were
--
makers
of
law
and
executors
of
law
.
Also
,
he
appreciated
*NL*
the
power
with
which
they
administered
the
law
.
Unlike
any
animals
he
*NL*
had
ever
encountered
,
they
did
not
bite
nor
claw
.
They
enforced
their
*NL*
live
strength
with
the
power
of
dead
things
.
Dead
things
did
their
*NL*
bidding
.
Thus
,
sticks
and
stones
,
directed
by
these
strange
creatures
,
*NL*
leaped
through
the
air
like
living
things
,
inflicting
grievous
hurts
upon
*NL*
the
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
mind
this
was
power
unusual
,
power
inconceivable
and
beyond
the
*NL*
natural
,
power
that
was
godlike
.
White
Fang
,
in
the
very
nature
of
him
,
*NL*
could
never
know
anything
about
gods
;
at
the
best
he
could
know
only
*NL*
things
that
were
beyond
knowing
--
but
the
wonder
and
awe
that
he
had
of
*NL*
these
man-animals
in
ways
resembled
what
would
be
the
wonder
and
awe
of
*NL*
man
at
sight
of
some
celestial
creature
,
on
a
mountain
top
,
hurling
*NL*
thunderbolts
from
either
hand
at
an
astonished
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
dog
had
been
driven
back
.
The
hubbub
died
down
.
And
White
Fang
*NL*
licked
his
hurts
and
meditated
upon
this
,
his
first
taste
of
pack-cruelty
*NL*
and
his
introduction
to
the
pack
.
He
had
never
dreamed
that
his
own
kind
*NL*
consisted
of
more
than
One
Eye
,
his
mother
,
and
himself
.
They
had
*NL*
constituted
a
kind
apart
,
and
here
,
abruptly
,
he
had
discovered
many
more
*NL*
creatures
apparently
of
his
own
kind
.
And
there
was
a
subconscious
*NL*
resentment
that
these
,
his
kind
,
at
first
sight
had
pitched
upon
him
and
*NL*
tried
to
destroy
him
.
In
the
same
way
he
resented
his
mother
being
tied
*NL*
with
a
stick
,
even
though
it
was
done
by
the
superior
man-animals
.
It
*NL*
savoured
of
the
trap
,
of
bondage
.
Yet
of
the
trap
and
of
bondage
he
knew
*NL*
nothing
.
Freedom
to
roam
and
run
and
lie
down
at
will
,
had
been
his
*NL*
heritage
;
and
here
it
was
being
infringed
upon
.
His
mother
's
movements
*NL*
were
restricted
to
the
length
of
a
stick
,
and
by
the
length
of
that
same
*NL*
stick
was
he
restricted
,
for
he
had
not
yet
got
beyond
the
need
of
his
*NL*
mother
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
like
it
.
Nor
did
he
like
it
when
the
man-animals
arose
and
*NL*
went
on
with
their
march
;
for
a
tiny
man-animal
took
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
stick
and
led
Kiche
captive
behind
him
,
and
behind
Kiche
followed
White
*NL*
Fang
,
greatly
perturbed
and
worried
by
this
new
adventure
he
had
entered
*NL*
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
down
the
valley
of
the
stream
,
far
beyond
White
Fang
's
widest
*NL*
ranging
,
until
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
valley
,
where
the
stream
ran
*NL*
into
the
Mackenzie
River
.
Here
,
where
canoes
were
cached
on
poles
high
*NL*
in
the
air
and
where
stood
fish-racks
for
the
drying
of
fish
,
camp
was
*NL*
made
;
and
White
Fang
looked
on
with
wondering
eyes
.
The
superiority
of
*NL*
these
man-animals
increased
with
every
moment
.
There
was
their
mastery
*NL*
over
all
these
sharp-fanged
dogs
.
It
breathed
of
power
.
But
greater
*NL*
than
that
,
to
the
wolf-cub
,
was
their
mastery
over
things
not
alive
;
*NL*
their
capacity
to
communicate
motion
to
unmoving
things
;
their
capacity
*NL*
to
change
the
very
face
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
last
that
especially
affected
him
.
The
elevation
of
frames
*NL*
of
poles
caught
his
eye
;
yet
this
in
itself
was
not
so
remarkable
,
being
*NL*
done
by
the
same
creatures
that
flung
sticks
and
stones
to
great
*NL*
distances
.
But
when
the
frames
of
poles
were
made
into
tepees
by
being
*NL*
covered
with
cloth
and
skins
,
White
Fang
was
astounded
.
It
was
the
*NL*
colossal
bulk
of
them
that
impressed
him
.
They
arose
around
him
,
on
*NL*
every
side
,
like
some
monstrous
quick-growing
form
of
life
.
They
*NL*
occupied
nearly
the
whole
circumference
of
his
field
of
vision
.
He
was
*NL*
afraid
of
them
.
They
loomed
ominously
above
him
;
and
when
the
breeze
*NL*
stirred
them
into
huge
movements
,
he
cowered
down
in
fear
,
keeping
his
*NL*
eyes
warily
upon
them
,
and
prepared
to
spring
away
if
they
attempted
to
*NL*
precipitate
themselves
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
a
short
while
his
fear
of
the
tepees
passed
away
.
He
saw
the
*NL*
women
and
children
passing
in
and
out
of
them
without
harm
,
and
he
saw
*NL*
the
dogs
trying
often
to
get
into
them
,
and
being
driven
away
with
sharp
*NL*
words
and
flying
stones
.
After
a
time
,
he
left
Kiche
's
side
and
crawled
*NL*
cautiously
toward
the
wall
of
the
nearest
tepee
.
It
was
the
curiosity
of
*NL*
growth
that
urged
him
on
--
the
necessity
of
learning
and
living
and
doing
*NL*
that
brings
experience
.
The
last
few
inches
to
the
wall
of
the
tepee
*NL*
were
crawled
with
painful
slowness
and
precaution
.
The
day
's
events
had
*NL*
prepared
him
for
the
unknown
to
manifest
itself
in
most
stupendous
and
*NL*
unthinkable
ways
.
At
last
his
nose
touched
the
canvas
.
He
waited
.
*NL*
Nothing
happened
.
Then
he
smelled
the
strange
fabric
,
saturated
with
the
*NL*
man-smell
.
He
closed
on
the
canvas
with
his
teeth
and
gave
a
gentle
tug
.
*NL*
Nothing
happened
,
though
the
adjacent
portions
of
the
tepee
moved
.
He
*NL*
tugged
harder
.
There
was
a
greater
movement
.
It
was
delightful
.
He
*NL*
tugged
still
harder
,
and
repeatedly
,
until
the
whole
tepee
was
in
motion
.
*NL*
Then
the
sharp
cry
of
a
squaw
inside
sent
him
scampering
back
to
Kiche
.
*NL*
But
after
that
he
was
afraid
no
more
of
the
looming
bulks
of
the
tepees
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
he
was
straying
away
again
from
his
mother
.
Her
stick
was
*NL*
tied
to
a
peg
in
the
ground
and
she
could
not
follow
him
.
A
part-grown
*NL*
puppy
,
somewhat
larger
and
older
than
he
,
came
toward
him
slowly
,
with
*NL*
ostentatious
and
belligerent
importance
.
The
puppy
's
name
,
as
White
Fang
*NL*
was
afterward
to
hear
him
called
,
was
Lip-lip
.
He
had
had
experience
in
*NL*
puppy
fights
and
was
already
something
of
a
bully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lip-lip
was
White
Fang
's
own
kind
,
and
,
being
only
a
puppy
,
did
not
seem
*NL*
dangerous
;
so
White
Fang
prepared
to
meet
him
in
a
friendly
spirit
.
But
*NL*
when
the
stranger
's
walk
became
stiff-legged
and
his
lips
lifted
clear
of
*NL*
his
teeth
,
White
Fang
stiffened
too
,
and
answered
with
lifted
lips
.
They
*NL*
half
circled
about
each
other
,
tentatively
,
snarling
and
bristling
.
This
*NL*
lasted
several
minutes
,
and
White
Fang
was
beginning
to
enjoy
it
,
as
a
*NL*
sort
of
game
.
But
suddenly
,
with
remarkable
swiftness
,
Lip-lip
leaped
*NL*
in
,
delivering
a
slashing
snap
,
and
leaped
away
again
.
The
snap
had
*NL*
taken
effect
on
the
shoulder
that
had
been
hurt
by
the
lynx
and
that
was
*NL*
still
sore
deep
down
near
the
bone
.
The
surprise
and
hurt
of
it
brought
*NL*
a
yelp
out
of
White
Fang
;
but
the
next
moment
,
in
a
rush
of
anger
,
he
was
*NL*
upon
Lip-lip
and
snapping
viciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lip-lip
had
lived
his
life
in
camp
and
had
fought
many
puppy
fights
.
*NL*
Three
times
,
four
times
,
and
half
a
dozen
times
,
his
sharp
little
teeth
*NL*
scored
on
the
newcomer
,
until
White
Fang
,
yelping
shamelessly
,
fled
to
*NL*
the
protection
of
his
mother
.
It
was
the
first
of
the
many
fights
he
was
*NL*
to
have
with
Lip-lip
,
for
they
were
enemies
from
the
start
,
born
so
,
with
*NL*
natures
destined
perpetually
to
clash
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kiche
licked
White
Fang
soothingly
with
her
tongue
,
and
tried
to
prevail
*NL*
upon
him
to
remain
with
her
.
But
his
curiosity
was
rampant
,
and
several
*NL*
minutes
later
he
was
venturing
forth
on
a
new
quest
.
He
came
upon
one
of
*NL*
the
man-animals
,
Grey
Beaver
,
who
was
squatting
on
his
hams
and
doing
*NL*
something
with
sticks
and
dry
moss
spread
before
him
on
the
ground
.
White
*NL*
Fang
came
near
to
him
and
watched
.
Grey
Beaver
made
mouth-noises
which
*NL*
White
Fang
interpreted
as
not
hostile
,
so
he
came
still
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Women
and
children
were
carrying
more
sticks
and
branches
to
Grey
Beaver
.
*NL*
It
was
evidently
an
affair
of
moment
.
White
Fang
came
in
until
he
*NL*
touched
Grey
Beaver
's
knee
,
so
curious
was
he
,
and
already
forgetful
that
*NL*
this
was
a
terrible
man-animal
.
Suddenly
he
saw
a
strange
thing
like
*NL*
mist
beginning
to
arise
from
the
sticks
and
moss
beneath
Grey
Beaver
's
*NL*
hands
.
Then
,
amongst
the
sticks
themselves
,
appeared
a
live
thing
,
*NL*
twisting
and
turning
,
of
a
colour
like
the
colour
of
the
sun
in
the
sky
.
*NL*
White
Fang
knew
nothing
about
fire
.
It
drew
him
as
the
light
,
in
the
*NL*
mouth
of
the
cave
had
drawn
him
in
his
early
puppyhood
.
He
crawled
the
*NL*
several
steps
toward
the
flame
.
He
heard
Grey
Beaver
chuckle
above
him
,
*NL*
and
he
knew
the
sound
was
not
hostile
.
Then
his
nose
touched
the
flame
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
instant
his
little
tongue
went
out
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
he
was
paralysed
.
The
unknown
,
lurking
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
sticks
and
moss
,
was
savagely
clutching
him
by
the
nose
.
He
scrambled
*NL*
backward
,
bursting
out
in
an
astonished
explosion
of
ki-yi
's
.
At
the
*NL*
sound
,
Kiche
leaped
snarling
to
the
end
of
her
stick
,
and
there
raged
*NL*
terribly
because
she
could
not
come
to
his
aid
.
But
Grey
Beaver
laughed
*NL*
loudly
,
and
slapped
his
thighs
,
and
told
the
happening
to
all
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
camp
,
till
everybody
was
laughing
uproariously
.
But
White
Fang
sat
*NL*
on
his
haunches
and
ki-yi
'd
and
ki-yi
'd
,
a
forlorn
and
pitiable
little
*NL*
figure
in
the
midst
of
the
man-animals
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
worst
hurt
he
had
ever
known
.
Both
nose
and
tongue
had
been
*NL*
scorched
by
the
live
thing
,
sun-coloured
,
that
had
grown
up
under
Grey
*NL*
Beaver
's
hands
.
He
cried
and
cried
interminably
,
and
every
fresh
wail
*NL*
was
greeted
by
bursts
of
laughter
on
the
part
of
the
man-animals
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
soothe
his
nose
with
his
tongue
,
but
the
tongue
was
burnt
too
,
*NL*
and
the
two
hurts
coming
together
produced
greater
hurt
;
whereupon
he
*NL*
cried
more
hopelessly
and
helplessly
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
shame
came
to
him
.
He
knew
laughter
and
the
meaning
of
it
.
It
*NL*
is
not
given
us
to
know
how
some
animals
know
laughter
,
and
know
when
*NL*
they
are
being
laughed
at
;
but
it
was
this
same
way
that
White
Fang
knew
*NL*
it
.
And
he
felt
shame
that
the
man-animals
should
be
laughing
at
him
.
He
*NL*
turned
and
fled
away
,
not
from
the
hurt
of
the
fire
,
but
from
the
*NL*
laughter
that
sank
even
deeper
,
and
hurt
in
the
spirit
of
him
.
And
he
*NL*
fled
to
Kiche
,
raging
at
the
end
of
her
stick
like
an
animal
gone
mad
--
to
*NL*
Kiche
,
the
one
creature
in
the
world
who
was
not
laughing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twilight
drew
down
and
night
came
on
,
and
White
Fang
lay
by
his
mother
's
*NL*
side
.
His
nose
and
tongue
still
hurt
,
but
he
was
perplexed
by
a
greater
*NL*
trouble
.
He
was
homesick
.
He
felt
a
vacancy
in
him
,
a
need
for
the
hush
*NL*
and
quietude
of
the
stream
and
the
cave
in
the
cliff
.
Life
had
become
*NL*
too
populous
.
There
were
so
many
of
the
man-animals
,
men
,
women
,
and
*NL*
children
,
all
making
noises
and
irritations
.
And
there
were
the
dogs
,
*NL*
ever
squabbling
and
bickering
,
bursting
into
uproars
and
creating
*NL*
confusions
.
The
restful
loneliness
of
the
only
life
he
had
known
was
*NL*
gone
.
Here
the
very
air
was
palpitant
with
life
.
It
hummed
and
buzzed
*NL*
unceasingly
.
Continually
changing
its
intensity
and
abruptly
variant
in
*NL*
pitch
,
it
impinged
on
his
nerves
and
senses
,
made
him
nervous
and
*NL*
restless
and
worried
him
with
a
perpetual
imminence
of
happening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
the
man-animals
coming
and
going
and
moving
about
the
camp
.
In
*NL*
fashion
distantly
resembling
the
way
men
look
upon
the
gods
they
create
,
*NL*
so
looked
White
Fang
upon
the
man-animals
before
him
.
They
were
superior
*NL*
creatures
,
of
a
verity
,
gods
.
To
his
dim
comprehension
they
were
as
much
*NL*
wonder-workers
as
gods
are
to
men
.
They
were
creatures
of
mastery
,
*NL*
possessing
all
manner
of
unknown
and
impossible
potencies
,
overlords
of
*NL*
the
alive
and
the
not
alive
--
making
obey
that
which
moved
,
imparting
*NL*
movement
to
that
which
did
not
move
,
and
making
life
,
sun-coloured
and
*NL*
biting
life
,
to
grow
out
of
dead
moss
and
wood
.
They
were
fire-makers
!
*NL*
They
were
gods
.

THE
BONDAGE

*NL*
*NL*
The
days
were
thronged
with
experience
for
White
Fang
.
During
the
time
*NL*
that
Kiche
was
tied
by
the
stick
,
he
ran
about
over
all
the
camp
,
*NL*
inquiring
,
investigating
,
learning
.
He
quickly
came
to
know
much
of
the
*NL*
ways
of
the
man-animals
,
but
familiarity
did
not
breed
contempt
.
The
*NL*
more
he
came
to
know
them
,
the
more
they
vindicated
their
superiority
,
*NL*
the
more
they
displayed
their
mysterious
powers
,
the
greater
loomed
their
*NL*
god-likeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
man
has
been
given
the
grief
,
often
,
of
seeing
his
gods
overthrown
and
*NL*
his
altars
crumbling
;
but
to
the
wolf
and
the
wild
dog
that
have
come
in
*NL*
to
crouch
at
man
's
feet
,
this
grief
has
never
come
.
Unlike
man
,
whose
*NL*
gods
are
of
the
unseen
and
the
overguessed
,
vapours
and
mists
of
fancy
*NL*
eluding
the
garmenture
of
reality
,
wandering
wraiths
of
desired
goodness
*NL*
and
power
,
intangible
out-croppings
of
self
into
the
realm
of
*NL*
spirit
--
unlike
man
,
the
wolf
and
the
wild
dog
that
have
come
in
to
the
*NL*
fire
find
their
gods
in
the
living
flesh
,
solid
to
the
touch
,
occupying
*NL*
earth-space
and
requiring
time
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
ends
and
*NL*
their
existence
.
No
effort
of
faith
is
necessary
to
believe
in
such
a
*NL*
god
;
no
effort
of
will
can
possibly
induce
disbelief
in
such
a
god
.
There
*NL*
is
no
getting
away
from
it
.
There
it
stands
,
on
its
two
hind-legs
,
club
*NL*
in
hand
,
immensely
potential
,
passionate
and
wrathful
and
loving
,
god
and
*NL*
mystery
and
power
all
wrapped
up
and
around
by
flesh
that
bleeds
when
it
*NL*
is
torn
and
that
is
good
to
eat
like
any
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
was
with
White
Fang
.
The
man-animals
were
gods
unmistakable
*NL*
and
unescapable
.
As
his
mother
,
Kiche
,
had
rendered
her
allegiance
to
*NL*
them
at
the
first
cry
of
her
name
,
so
he
was
beginning
to
render
his
*NL*
allegiance
.
He
gave
them
the
trail
as
a
privilege
indubitably
theirs
.
*NL*
When
they
walked
,
he
got
out
of
their
way
.
When
they
called
,
he
came
.
*NL*
When
they
threatened
,
he
cowered
down
.
When
they
commanded
him
to
go
,
he
*NL*
went
away
hurriedly
.
For
behind
any
wish
of
theirs
was
power
to
enforce
*NL*
that
wish
,
power
that
hurt
,
power
that
expressed
itself
in
clouts
and
*NL*
clubs
,
in
flying
stones
and
stinging
lashes
of
whips
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
belonged
to
them
as
all
dogs
belonged
to
them
.
His
actions
were
*NL*
theirs
to
command
.
His
body
was
theirs
to
maul
,
to
stamp
upon
,
to
*NL*
tolerate
.
Such
was
the
lesson
that
was
quickly
borne
in
upon
him
.
It
*NL*
came
hard
,
going
as
it
did
,
counter
to
much
that
was
strong
and
dominant
*NL*
in
his
own
nature
;
and
,
while
he
disliked
it
in
the
learning
of
it
,
*NL*
unknown
to
himself
he
was
learning
to
like
it
.
It
was
a
placing
of
his
*NL*
destiny
in
another
's
hands
,
a
shifting
of
the
responsibilities
of
*NL*
existence
.
This
in
itself
was
compensation
,
for
it
is
always
easier
to
*NL*
lean
upon
another
than
to
stand
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
did
not
all
happen
in
a
day
,
this
giving
over
of
himself
,
body
and
*NL*
soul
,
to
the
man-animals
.
He
could
not
immediately
forego
his
wild
*NL*
heritage
and
his
memories
of
the
Wild
.
There
were
days
when
he
crept
to
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
stood
and
listened
to
something
calling
him
*NL*
far
and
away
.
And
always
he
returned
,
restless
and
uncomfortable
,
to
*NL*
whimper
softly
and
wistfully
at
Kiche
's
side
and
to
lick
her
face
with
*NL*
eager
,
questioning
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
learned
rapidly
the
ways
of
the
camp
.
He
knew
the
injustice
*NL*
and
greediness
of
the
older
dogs
when
meat
or
fish
was
thrown
out
to
be
*NL*
eaten
.
He
came
to
know
that
men
were
more
just
,
children
more
cruel
,
and
*NL*
women
more
kindly
and
more
likely
to
toss
him
a
bit
of
meat
or
bone
.
And
*NL*
after
two
or
three
painful
adventures
with
the
mothers
of
part-grown
*NL*
puppies
,
he
came
into
the
knowledge
that
it
was
always
good
policy
to
let
*NL*
such
mothers
alone
,
to
keep
away
from
them
as
far
as
possible
,
and
to
*NL*
avoid
them
when
he
saw
them
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
bane
of
his
life
was
Lip-lip
.
Larger
,
older
,
and
stronger
,
Lip
-
*NL*
lip
had
selected
White
Fang
for
his
special
object
of
persecution
.
While
*NL*
Fang
fought
willingly
enough
,
but
he
was
outclassed
.
His
enemy
was
too
*NL*
big
.
Lip-lip
became
a
nightmare
to
him
.
Whenever
he
ventured
away
from
*NL*
his
mother
,
the
bully
was
sure
to
appear
,
trailing
at
his
heels
,
snarling
*NL*
at
him
,
picking
upon
him
,
and
watchful
of
an
opportunity
,
when
no
man
-
*NL*
animal
was
near
,
to
spring
upon
him
and
force
a
fight
.
As
Lip-lip
*NL*
invariably
won
,
he
enjoyed
it
hugely
.
It
became
his
chief
delight
in
*NL*
life
,
as
it
became
White
Fang
's
chief
torment
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
effect
upon
White
Fang
was
not
to
cow
him
.
Though
he
suffered
*NL*
most
of
the
damage
and
was
always
defeated
,
his
spirit
remained
*NL*
unsubdued
.
Yet
a
bad
effect
was
produced
.
He
became
malignant
and
*NL*
morose
.
His
temper
had
been
savage
by
birth
,
but
it
became
more
savage
*NL*
under
this
unending
persecution
.
The
genial
,
playful
,
puppyish
side
of
*NL*
him
found
little
expression
.
He
never
played
and
gambolled
about
with
*NL*
the
other
puppies
of
the
camp
.
Lip-lip
would
not
permit
it
.
The
moment
*NL*
White
Fang
appeared
near
them
,
Lip-lip
was
upon
him
,
bullying
and
*NL*
hectoring
him
,
or
fighting
with
him
until
he
had
driven
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
all
this
was
to
rob
White
Fang
of
much
of
his
puppyhood
and
*NL*
to
make
him
in
his
comportment
older
than
his
age
.
Denied
the
outlet
,
*NL*
through
play
,
of
his
energies
,
he
recoiled
upon
himself
and
developed
his
*NL*
mental
processes
.
He
became
cunning
;
he
had
idle
time
in
which
to
devote
*NL*
himself
to
thoughts
of
trickery
.
Prevented
from
obtaining
his
share
of
*NL*
meat
and
fish
when
a
general
feed
was
given
to
the
camp-dogs
,
he
became
a
*NL*
clever
thief
.
He
had
to
forage
for
himself
,
and
he
foraged
well
,
though
*NL*
he
was
oft-times
a
plague
to
the
squaws
in
consequence
.
He
learned
to
*NL*
sneak
about
camp
,
to
be
crafty
,
to
know
what
was
going
on
everywhere
,
to
*NL*
see
and
to
hear
everything
and
to
reason
accordingly
,
and
successfully
to
*NL*
devise
ways
and
means
of
avoiding
his
implacable
persecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
early
in
the
days
of
his
persecution
that
he
played
his
first
*NL*
really
big
crafty
game
and
got
therefrom
his
first
taste
of
revenge
.
As
*NL*
Kiche
,
when
with
the
wolves
,
had
lured
out
to
destruction
dogs
from
the
*NL*
camps
of
men
,
so
White
Fang
,
in
manner
somewhat
similar
,
lured
Lip-lip
*NL*
into
Kiche
's
avenging
jaws
.
Retreating
before
Lip-lip
,
White
Fang
made
*NL*
an
indirect
flight
that
led
in
and
out
and
around
the
various
tepees
of
*NL*
the
camp
.
He
was
a
good
runner
,
swifter
than
any
puppy
of
his
size
,
and
*NL*
swifter
than
Lip-lip
.
But
he
did
not
run
his
best
in
this
chase
.
He
*NL*
barely
held
his
own
,
one
leap
ahead
of
his
pursuer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lip-lip
,
excited
by
the
chase
and
by
the
persistent
nearness
of
his
*NL*
victim
,
forgot
caution
and
locality
.
When
he
remembered
locality
,
it
was
*NL*
too
late
.
Dashing
at
top
speed
around
a
tepee
,
he
ran
full
tilt
into
*NL*
Kiche
lying
at
the
end
of
her
stick
.
He
gave
one
yelp
of
consternation
,
*NL*
and
then
her
punishing
jaws
closed
upon
him
.
She
was
tied
,
but
he
could
*NL*
not
get
away
from
her
easily
.
She
rolled
him
off
his
legs
so
that
he
*NL*
could
not
run
,
while
she
repeatedly
ripped
and
slashed
him
with
her
*NL*
fangs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
last
he
succeeded
in
rolling
clear
of
her
,
he
crawled
to
his
*NL*
feet
,
badly
dishevelled
,
hurt
both
in
body
and
in
spirit
.
His
hair
was
*NL*
standing
out
all
over
him
in
tufts
where
her
teeth
had
mauled
.
He
stood
*NL*
where
he
had
arisen
,
opened
his
mouth
,
and
broke
out
the
long
,
*NL*
heart-broken
puppy
wail
.
But
even
this
he
was
not
allowed
to
complete
.
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
it
,
White
Fang
,
rushing
in
,
sank
his
teeth
into
*NL*
Lip-lip
's
hind
leg
.
There
was
no
fight
left
in
Lip-lip
,
and
he
ran
away
*NL*
shamelessly
,
his
victim
hot
on
his
heels
and
worrying
him
all
the
way
*NL*
back
to
his
own
tepee
.
Here
the
squaws
came
to
his
aid
,
and
White
Fang
,
*NL*
transformed
into
a
raging
demon
,
was
finally
driven
off
only
by
a
*NL*
fusillade
of
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Came
the
day
when
Grey
Beaver
,
deciding
that
the
liability
of
her
running
*NL*
away
was
past
,
released
Kiche
.
White
Fang
was
delighted
with
his
*NL*
mother
's
freedom
.
He
accompanied
her
joyfully
about
the
camp
;
and
,
so
*NL*
long
as
he
remained
close
by
her
side
,
Lip-lip
kept
a
respectful
*NL*
distance
.
White
Fang
even
bristled
up
to
him
and
walked
stiff-legged
,
*NL*
but
Lip-lip
ignored
the
challenge
.
He
was
no
fool
himself
,
and
whatever
*NL*
vengeance
he
desired
to
wreak
,
he
could
wait
until
he
caught
White
Fang
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
that
day
,
Kiche
and
White
Fang
strayed
into
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
woods
next
to
the
camp
.
He
had
led
his
mother
there
,
step
by
step
,
and
*NL*
now
when
she
stopped
,
he
tried
to
inveigle
her
farther
.
The
stream
,
the
*NL*
lair
,
and
the
quiet
woods
were
calling
to
him
,
and
he
wanted
her
to
come
.
*NL*
He
ran
on
a
few
steps
,
stopped
,
and
looked
back
.
She
had
not
moved
.
He
*NL*
whined
pleadingly
,
and
scurried
playfully
in
and
out
of
the
underbrush
.
*NL*
He
ran
back
to
her
,
licked
her
face
,
and
ran
on
again
.
And
still
she
did
*NL*
not
move
.
He
stopped
and
regarded
her
,
all
of
an
intentness
and
*NL*
eagerness
,
physically
expressed
,
that
slowly
faded
out
of
him
as
she
*NL*
turned
her
head
and
gazed
back
at
the
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
calling
to
him
out
there
in
the
open
.
His
mother
*NL*
heard
it
too
.
But
she
heard
also
that
other
and
louder
call
,
the
call
of
*NL*
the
fire
and
of
man
--
the
call
which
has
been
given
alone
of
all
animals
*NL*
to
the
wolf
to
answer
,
to
the
wolf
and
the
wild-dog
,
who
are
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kiche
turned
and
slowly
trotted
back
toward
camp
.
Stronger
than
the
*NL*
physical
restraint
of
the
stick
was
the
clutch
of
the
camp
upon
her
.
*NL*
Unseen
and
occultly
,
the
gods
still
gripped
with
their
power
and
would
*NL*
not
let
her
go
.
White
Fang
sat
down
in
the
shadow
of
a
birch
and
*NL*
whimpered
softly
.
There
was
a
strong
smell
of
pine
,
and
subtle
wood
*NL*
fragrances
filled
the
air
,
reminding
him
of
his
old
life
of
freedom
*NL*
before
the
days
of
his
bondage
.
But
he
was
still
only
a
part-grown
*NL*
puppy
,
and
stronger
than
the
call
either
of
man
or
of
the
Wild
was
the
*NL*
call
of
his
mother
.
All
the
hours
of
his
short
life
he
had
depended
upon
*NL*
her
.
The
time
was
yet
to
come
for
independence
.
So
he
arose
and
trotted
*NL*
forlornly
back
to
camp
,
pausing
once
,
and
twice
,
to
sit
down
and
whimper
*NL*
and
to
listen
to
the
call
that
still
sounded
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Wild
the
time
of
a
mother
with
her
young
is
short
;
but
under
the
*NL*
dominion
of
man
it
is
sometimes
even
shorter
.
Thus
it
was
with
White
*NL*
Fang
.
Grey
Beaver
was
in
the
debt
of
Three
Eagles
.
Three
Eagles
was
*NL*
going
away
on
a
trip
up
the
Mackenzie
to
the
Great
Slave
Lake
.
A
strip
*NL*
of
scarlet
cloth
,
a
bearskin
,
twenty
cartridges
,
and
Kiche
,
went
to
pay
*NL*
the
debt
.
White
Fang
saw
his
mother
taken
aboard
Three
Eagles
'
canoe
,
*NL*
and
tried
to
follow
her
.
A
blow
from
Three
Eagles
knocked
him
backward
*NL*
to
the
land
.
The
canoe
shoved
off
.
He
sprang
into
the
water
and
swam
*NL*
after
it
,
deaf
to
the
sharp
cries
of
Grey
Beaver
to
return
.
Even
a
man
-
*NL*
animal
,
a
god
,
White
Fang
ignored
,
such
was
the
terror
he
was
in
of
*NL*
losing
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
gods
are
accustomed
to
being
obeyed
,
and
Grey
Beaver
wrathfully
*NL*
launched
a
canoe
in
pursuit
.
When
he
overtook
White
Fang
,
he
reached
*NL*
down
and
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
lifted
him
clear
of
the
water
.
He
did
*NL*
not
deposit
him
at
once
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
.
Holding
him
*NL*
suspended
with
one
hand
,
with
the
other
hand
he
proceeded
to
give
him
a
*NL*
beating
.
And
it
_
was
_
a
beating
.
His
hand
was
heavy
.
Every
blow
was
*NL*
shrewd
to
hurt
;
and
he
delivered
a
multitude
of
blows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Impelled
by
the
blows
that
rained
upon
him
,
now
from
this
side
,
now
from
*NL*
that
,
White
Fang
swung
back
and
forth
like
an
erratic
and
jerky
pendulum
.
*NL*
Varying
were
the
emotions
that
surged
through
him
.
At
first
,
he
had
*NL*
known
surprise
.
Then
came
a
momentary
fear
,
when
he
yelped
several
times
*NL*
to
the
impact
of
the
hand
.
But
this
was
quickly
followed
by
anger
.
His
*NL*
free
nature
asserted
itself
,
and
he
showed
his
teeth
and
snarled
*NL*
fearlessly
in
the
face
of
the
wrathful
god
.
This
but
served
to
make
the
*NL*
god
more
wrathful
.
The
blows
came
faster
,
heavier
,
more
shrewd
to
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
continued
to
beat
,
White
Fang
continued
to
snarl
.
But
this
*NL*
could
not
last
for
ever
.
One
or
the
other
must
give
over
,
and
that
one
*NL*
was
White
Fang
.
Fear
surged
through
him
again
.
For
the
first
time
he
*NL*
was
being
really
man-handled
.
The
occasional
blows
of
sticks
and
stones
*NL*
he
had
previously
experienced
were
as
caresses
compared
with
this
.
He
*NL*
broke
down
and
began
to
cry
and
yelp
.
For
a
time
each
blow
brought
a
*NL*
yelp
from
him
;
but
fear
passed
into
terror
,
until
finally
his
yelps
were
*NL*
voiced
in
unbroken
succession
,
unconnected
with
the
rhythm
of
the
*NL*
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Grey
Beaver
withheld
his
hand
.
White
Fang
,
hanging
limply
,
*NL*
continued
to
cry
.
This
seemed
to
satisfy
his
master
,
who
flung
him
down
*NL*
roughly
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
.
In
the
meantime
the
canoe
had
*NL*
drifted
down
the
stream
.
Grey
Beaver
picked
up
the
paddle
.
White
Fang
*NL*
was
in
his
way
.
He
spurned
him
savagely
with
his
foot
.
In
that
moment
*NL*
White
Fang
's
free
nature
flashed
forth
again
,
and
he
sank
his
teeth
into
*NL*
the
moccasined
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beating
that
had
gone
before
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
beating
*NL*
he
now
received
.
Grey
Beaver
's
wrath
was
terrible
;
likewise
was
White
*NL*
Fang
's
fright
.
Not
only
the
hand
,
but
the
hard
wooden
paddle
was
used
*NL*
upon
him
;
and
he
was
bruised
and
sore
in
all
his
small
body
when
he
was
*NL*
again
flung
down
in
the
canoe
.
Again
,
and
this
time
with
purpose
,
did
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
kick
him
.
White
Fang
did
not
repeat
his
attack
on
the
foot
.
*NL*
He
had
learned
another
lesson
of
his
bondage
.
Never
,
no
matter
what
the
*NL*
circumstance
,
must
he
dare
to
bite
the
god
who
was
lord
and
master
over
*NL*
him
;
the
body
of
the
lord
and
master
was
sacred
,
not
to
be
defiled
by
the
*NL*
teeth
of
such
as
he
.
That
was
evidently
the
crime
of
crimes
,
the
one
*NL*
offence
there
was
no
condoning
nor
overlooking
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
canoe
touched
the
shore
,
White
Fang
lay
whimpering
and
*NL*
motionless
,
waiting
the
will
of
Grey
Beaver
.
It
was
Grey
Beaver
's
will
*NL*
that
he
should
go
ashore
,
for
ashore
he
was
flung
,
striking
heavily
on
*NL*
his
side
and
hurting
his
bruises
afresh
.
He
crawled
tremblingly
to
his
*NL*
feet
and
stood
whimpering
.
Lip-lip
,
who
had
watched
the
whole
proceeding
*NL*
from
the
bank
,
now
rushed
upon
him
,
knocking
him
over
and
sinking
his
*NL*
teeth
into
him
.
White
Fang
was
too
helpless
to
defend
himself
,
and
it
*NL*
would
have
gone
hard
with
him
had
not
Grey
Beaver
's
foot
shot
out
,
*NL*
lifting
Lip-lip
into
the
air
with
its
violence
so
that
he
smashed
down
to
*NL*
earth
a
dozen
feet
away
.
This
was
the
man-animal
's
justice
;
and
even
*NL*
then
,
in
his
own
pitiable
plight
,
White
Fang
experienced
a
little
*NL*
grateful
thrill
.
At
Grey
Beaver
's
heels
he
limped
obediently
through
the
*NL*
village
to
the
tepee
.
And
so
it
came
that
White
Fang
learned
that
the
*NL*
right
to
punish
was
something
the
gods
reserved
for
themselves
and
denied
*NL*
to
the
lesser
creatures
under
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
when
all
was
still
,
White
Fang
remembered
his
mother
and
*NL*
sorrowed
for
her
.
He
sorrowed
too
loudly
and
woke
up
Grey
Beaver
,
who
*NL*
beat
him
.
After
that
he
mourned
gently
when
the
gods
were
around
.
But
*NL*
sometimes
,
straying
off
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
by
himself
,
he
gave
vent
*NL*
to
his
grief
,
and
cried
it
out
with
loud
whimperings
and
wailings
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
this
period
that
he
might
have
harkened
to
the
memories
of
*NL*
the
lair
and
the
stream
and
run
back
to
the
Wild
.
But
the
memory
of
his
*NL*
mother
held
him
.
As
the
hunting
man-animals
went
out
and
came
back
,
so
*NL*
she
would
come
back
to
the
village
some
time
.
So
he
remained
in
his
*NL*
bondage
waiting
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
altogether
an
unhappy
bondage
.
There
was
much
to
interest
*NL*
him
.
Something
was
always
happening
.
There
was
no
end
to
the
strange
*NL*
things
these
gods
did
,
and
he
was
always
curious
to
see
.
Besides
,
he
was
*NL*
learning
how
to
get
along
with
Grey
Beaver
.
Obedience
,
rigid
,
*NL*
undeviating
obedience
,
was
what
was
exacted
of
him
;
and
in
return
he
*NL*
escaped
beatings
and
his
existence
was
tolerated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nay
,
Grey
Beaver
himself
sometimes
tossed
him
a
piece
of
meat
,
and
*NL*
defended
him
against
the
other
dogs
in
the
eating
of
it
.
And
such
a
*NL*
piece
of
meat
was
of
value
.
It
was
worth
more
,
in
some
strange
way
,
then
*NL*
a
dozen
pieces
of
meat
from
the
hand
of
a
squaw
.
Grey
Beaver
never
*NL*
petted
nor
caressed
.
Perhaps
it
was
the
weight
of
his
hand
,
perhaps
his
*NL*
justice
,
perhaps
the
sheer
power
of
him
,
and
perhaps
it
was
all
these
*NL*
things
that
influenced
White
Fang
;
for
a
certain
tie
of
attachment
was
*NL*
forming
between
him
and
his
surly
lord
.
*NL*
*NL*
Insidiously
,
and
by
remote
ways
,
as
well
as
by
the
power
of
stick
and
*NL*
stone
and
clout
of
hand
,
were
the
shackles
of
White
Fang
's
bondage
being
*NL*
riveted
upon
him
.
The
qualities
in
his
kind
that
in
the
beginning
made
*NL*
it
possible
for
them
to
come
in
to
the
fires
of
men
,
were
qualities
*NL*
capable
of
development
.
They
were
developing
in
him
,
and
the
camp-life
,
*NL*
replete
with
misery
as
it
was
,
was
secretly
endearing
itself
to
him
all
*NL*
the
time
.
But
White
Fang
was
unaware
of
it
.
He
knew
only
grief
for
the
*NL*
loss
of
Kiche
,
hope
for
her
return
,
and
a
hungry
yearning
for
the
free
*NL*
life
that
had
been
his
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
OUTCAST
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Lip-lip
continued
so
to
darken
his
days
that
White
Fang
became
wickeder
*NL*
and
more
ferocious
than
it
was
his
natural
right
to
be
.
Savageness
was
a
*NL*
part
of
his
make-up
,
but
the
savageness
thus
developed
exceeded
his
make
-
*NL*
up
.
He
acquired
a
reputation
for
wickedness
amongst
the
man-animals
*NL*
themselves
.
Wherever
there
was
trouble
and
uproar
in
camp
,
fighting
and
*NL*
squabbling
or
the
outcry
of
a
squaw
over
a
bit
of
stolen
meat
,
they
were
*NL*
sure
to
find
White
Fang
mixed
up
in
it
and
usually
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
*NL*
They
did
not
bother
to
look
after
the
causes
of
his
conduct
.
They
saw
*NL*
only
the
effects
,
and
the
effects
were
bad
.
He
was
a
sneak
and
a
thief
,
*NL*
a
mischief-maker
,
a
fomenter
of
trouble
;
and
irate
squaws
told
him
to
his
*NL*
face
,
the
while
he
eyed
them
alert
and
ready
to
dodge
any
quick-flung
*NL*
missile
,
that
he
was
a
wolf
and
worthless
and
bound
to
come
to
an
evil
*NL*
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
himself
an
outcast
in
the
midst
of
the
populous
camp
.
All
the
*NL*
young
dogs
followed
Lip-lip
's
lead
.
There
was
a
difference
between
White
*NL*
Fang
and
them
.
Perhaps
they
sensed
his
wild-wood
breed
,
and
*NL*
instinctively
felt
for
him
the
enmity
that
the
domestic
dog
feels
for
the
*NL*
wolf
.
But
be
that
as
it
may
,
they
joined
with
Lip-lip
in
the
*NL*
persecution
.
And
,
once
declared
against
him
,
they
found
good
reason
to
*NL*
continue
declared
against
him
.
One
and
all
,
from
time
to
time
,
they
felt
*NL*
his
teeth
;
and
to
his
credit
,
he
gave
more
than
he
received
.
Many
of
*NL*
them
he
could
whip
in
single
fight
;
but
single
fight
was
denied
him
.
The
*NL*
beginning
of
such
a
fight
was
a
signal
for
all
the
young
dogs
in
camp
to
*NL*
come
running
and
pitch
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
this
pack-persecution
he
learned
two
important
things
:
how
to
take
*NL*
care
of
himself
in
a
mass-fight
against
him
--
and
how
,
on
a
single
dog
,
to
*NL*
inflict
the
greatest
amount
of
damage
in
the
briefest
space
of
time
.
To
*NL*
keep
one
's
feet
in
the
midst
of
the
hostile
mass
meant
life
,
and
this
he
*NL*
learnt
well
.
He
became
cat-like
in
his
ability
to
stay
on
his
feet
.
Even
*NL*
grown
dogs
might
hurtle
him
backward
or
sideways
with
the
impact
of
their
*NL*
heavy
bodies
;
and
backward
or
sideways
he
would
go
,
in
the
air
or
sliding
*NL*
on
the
ground
,
but
always
with
his
legs
under
him
and
his
feet
downward
*NL*
to
the
mother
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
dogs
fight
,
there
are
usually
preliminaries
to
the
actual
*NL*
combat
--
snarlings
and
bristlings
and
stiff-legged
struttings
.
But
White
*NL*
Fang
learned
to
omit
these
preliminaries
.
Delay
meant
the
coming
against
*NL*
him
of
all
the
young
dogs
.
He
must
do
his
work
quickly
and
get
away
.
So
*NL*
he
learnt
to
give
no
warning
of
his
intention
.
He
rushed
in
and
snapped
*NL*
and
slashed
on
the
instant
,
without
notice
,
before
his
foe
could
prepare
*NL*
to
meet
him
.
Thus
he
learned
how
to
inflict
quick
and
severe
damage
.
*NL*
Also
he
learned
the
value
of
surprise
.
A
dog
,
taken
off
its
guard
,
its
*NL*
shoulder
slashed
open
or
its
ear
ripped
in
ribbons
before
it
knew
what
*NL*
was
happening
,
was
a
dog
half
whipped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Furthermore
,
it
was
remarkably
easy
to
overthrow
a
dog
taken
by
surprise
;
*NL*
while
a
dog
,
thus
overthrown
,
invariably
exposed
for
a
moment
the
soft
*NL*
underside
of
its
neck
--
the
vulnerable
point
at
which
to
strike
for
its
*NL*
life
.
White
Fang
knew
this
point
.
It
was
a
knowledge
bequeathed
to
him
*NL*
directly
from
the
hunting
generation
of
wolves
.
So
it
was
that
White
*NL*
Fang
's
method
when
he
took
the
offensive
,
was
:
first
to
find
a
young
dog
*NL*
alone
;
second
,
to
surprise
it
and
knock
it
off
its
feet
;
and
third
,
to
*NL*
drive
in
with
his
teeth
at
the
soft
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
but
partly
grown
his
jaws
had
not
yet
become
large
enough
nor
*NL*
strong
enough
to
make
his
throat-attack
deadly
;
but
many
a
young
dog
went
*NL*
around
camp
with
a
lacerated
throat
in
token
of
White
Fang
's
intention
.
*NL*
And
one
day
,
catching
one
of
his
enemies
alone
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
,
*NL*
he
managed
,
by
repeatedly
overthrowing
him
and
attacking
the
throat
,
to
*NL*
cut
the
great
vein
and
let
out
the
life
.
There
was
a
great
row
that
*NL*
night
.
He
had
been
observed
,
the
news
had
been
carried
to
the
dead
dog
's
*NL*
master
,
the
squaws
remembered
all
the
instances
of
stolen
meat
,
and
Grey
*NL*
Beaver
was
beset
by
many
angry
voices
.
But
he
resolutely
held
the
door
*NL*
of
his
tepee
,
inside
which
he
had
placed
the
culprit
,
and
refused
to
*NL*
permit
the
vengeance
for
which
his
tribespeople
clamoured
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
became
hated
by
man
and
dog
.
During
this
period
of
his
*NL*
development
he
never
knew
a
moment
's
security
.
The
tooth
of
every
dog
*NL*
was
against
him
,
the
hand
of
every
man
.
He
was
greeted
with
snarls
by
*NL*
his
kind
,
with
curses
and
stones
by
his
gods
.
He
lived
tensely
.
He
was
*NL*
always
keyed
up
,
alert
for
attack
,
wary
of
being
attacked
,
with
an
eye
*NL*
for
sudden
and
unexpected
missiles
,
prepared
to
act
precipitately
and
*NL*
coolly
,
to
leap
in
with
a
flash
of
teeth
,
or
to
leap
away
with
a
menacing
*NL*
snarl
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
snarling
he
could
snarl
more
terribly
than
any
dog
,
young
or
old
,
*NL*
in
camp
.
The
intent
of
the
snarl
is
to
warn
or
frighten
,
and
judgment
is
*NL*
required
to
know
when
it
should
be
used
.
White
Fang
knew
how
to
make
it
*NL*
and
when
to
make
it
.
Into
his
snarl
he
incorporated
all
that
was
*NL*
vicious
,
malignant
,
and
horrible
.
With
nose
serrulated
by
continuous
*NL*
spasms
,
hair
bristling
in
recurrent
waves
,
tongue
whipping
out
like
a
red
*NL*
snake
and
whipping
back
again
,
ears
flattened
down
,
eyes
gleaming
hatred
,
*NL*
lips
wrinkled
back
,
and
fangs
exposed
and
dripping
,
he
could
compel
a
*NL*
pause
on
the
part
of
almost
any
assailant
.
A
temporary
pause
,
when
taken
*NL*
off
his
guard
,
gave
him
the
vital
moment
in
which
to
think
and
determine
*NL*
his
action
.
But
often
a
pause
so
gained
lengthened
out
until
it
evolved
*NL*
into
a
complete
cessation
from
the
attack
.
And
before
more
than
one
of
*NL*
the
grown
dogs
White
Fang
's
snarl
enabled
him
to
beat
an
honourable
*NL*
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
outcast
himself
from
the
pack
of
the
part-grown
dogs
,
his
sanguinary
*NL*
methods
and
remarkable
efficiency
made
the
pack
pay
for
its
persecution
*NL*
of
him
.
Not
permitted
himself
to
run
with
the
pack
,
the
curious
state
of
*NL*
affairs
obtained
that
no
member
of
the
pack
could
run
outside
the
pack
.
*NL*
White
Fang
would
not
permit
it
.
What
of
his
bushwhacking
and
waylaying
*NL*
tactics
,
the
young
dogs
were
afraid
to
run
by
themselves
.
With
the
*NL*
exception
of
Lip-lip
,
they
were
compelled
to
hunch
together
for
mutual
*NL*
protection
against
the
terrible
enemy
they
had
made
.
A
puppy
alone
by
*NL*
the
river
bank
meant
a
puppy
dead
or
a
puppy
that
aroused
the
camp
with
*NL*
its
shrill
pain
and
terror
as
it
fled
back
from
the
wolf-cub
that
had
*NL*
waylaid
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
White
Fang
's
reprisals
did
not
cease
,
even
when
the
young
dogs
had
*NL*
learned
thoroughly
that
they
must
stay
together
.
He
attacked
them
when
*NL*
he
caught
them
alone
,
and
they
attacked
him
when
they
were
bunched
.
The
*NL*
sight
of
him
was
sufficient
to
start
them
rushing
after
him
,
at
which
*NL*
times
his
swiftness
usually
carried
him
into
safety
.
But
woe
the
dog
*NL*
that
outran
his
fellows
in
such
pursuit
!
White
Fang
had
learned
to
turn
*NL*
suddenly
upon
the
pursuer
that
was
ahead
of
the
pack
and
thoroughly
to
*NL*
rip
him
up
before
the
pack
could
arrive
.
This
occurred
with
great
*NL*
frequency
,
for
,
once
in
full
cry
,
the
dogs
were
prone
to
forget
*NL*
themselves
in
the
excitement
of
the
chase
,
while
White
Fang
never
forgot
*NL*
himself
.
Stealing
backward
glances
as
he
ran
,
he
was
always
ready
to
*NL*
whirl
around
and
down
the
overzealous
pursuer
that
outran
his
fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
dogs
are
bound
to
play
,
and
out
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
*NL*
they
realised
their
play
in
this
mimic
warfare
.
Thus
it
was
that
the
*NL*
hunt
of
White
Fang
became
their
chief
game
--
a
deadly
game
,
withal
,
and
at
*NL*
all
times
a
serious
game
.
He
,
on
the
other
hand
,
being
the
*NL*
fastest-footed
,
was
unafraid
to
venture
anywhere
.
During
the
period
that
*NL*
he
waited
vainly
for
his
mother
to
come
back
,
he
led
the
pack
many
a
wild
*NL*
chase
through
the
adjacent
woods
.
But
the
pack
invariably
lost
him
.
Its
*NL*
noise
and
outcry
warned
him
of
its
presence
,
while
he
ran
alone
,
velvet
-
*NL*
footed
,
silently
,
a
moving
shadow
among
the
trees
after
the
manner
of
his
*NL*
father
and
mother
before
him
.
Further
he
was
more
directly
connected
*NL*
with
the
Wild
than
they
;
and
he
knew
more
of
its
secrets
and
stratagems
.
*NL*
A
favourite
trick
of
his
was
to
lose
his
trail
in
running
water
and
then
*NL*
lie
quietly
in
a
near-by
thicket
while
their
baffled
cries
arose
around
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hated
by
his
kind
and
by
mankind
,
indomitable
,
perpetually
warred
upon
*NL*
and
himself
waging
perpetual
war
,
his
development
was
rapid
and
*NL*
one-sided
.
This
was
no
soil
for
kindliness
and
affection
to
blossom
in
.
*NL*
Of
such
things
he
had
not
the
faintest
glimmering
.
The
code
he
learned
*NL*
was
to
obey
the
strong
and
to
oppress
the
weak
.
Grey
Beaver
was
a
god
,
*NL*
and
strong
.
Therefore
White
Fang
obeyed
him
.
But
the
dog
younger
or
*NL*
smaller
than
himself
was
weak
,
a
thing
to
be
destroyed
.
His
development
*NL*
was
in
the
direction
of
power
.
In
order
to
face
the
constant
danger
of
*NL*
hurt
and
even
of
destruction
,
his
predatory
and
protective
faculties
were
*NL*
unduly
developed
.
He
became
quicker
of
movement
than
the
other
dogs
,
*NL*
swifter
of
foot
,
craftier
,
deadlier
,
more
lithe
,
more
lean
with
ironlike
*NL*
muscle
and
sinew
,
more
enduring
,
more
cruel
,
more
ferocious
,
and
more
*NL*
intelligent
.
He
had
to
become
all
these
things
,
else
he
would
not
have
*NL*
held
his
own
nor
survive
the
hostile
environment
in
which
he
found
*NL*
himself
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
TRAIL
OF
THE
GODS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fall
of
the
year
,
when
the
days
were
shortening
and
the
bite
of
*NL*
the
frost
was
coming
into
the
air
,
White
Fang
got
his
chance
for
liberty
.
*NL*
For
several
days
there
had
been
a
great
hubbub
in
the
village
.
The
*NL*
summer
camp
was
being
dismantled
,
and
the
tribe
,
bag
and
baggage
,
was
*NL*
preparing
to
go
off
to
the
fall
hunting
.
White
Fang
watched
it
all
with
*NL*
eager
eyes
,
and
when
the
tepees
began
to
come
down
and
the
canoes
were
*NL*
loading
at
the
bank
,
he
understood
.
Already
the
canoes
were
departing
,
*NL*
and
some
had
disappeared
down
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
deliberately
he
determined
to
stay
behind
.
He
waited
his
*NL*
opportunity
to
slink
out
of
camp
to
the
woods
.
Here
,
in
the
running
*NL*
stream
where
ice
was
beginning
to
form
,
he
hid
his
trail
.
Then
he
*NL*
crawled
into
the
heart
of
a
dense
thicket
and
waited
.
The
time
passed
*NL*
by
,
and
he
slept
intermittently
for
hours
.
Then
he
was
aroused
by
Grey
*NL*
Beaver
's
voice
calling
him
by
name
.
There
were
other
voices
.
White
Fang
*NL*
could
hear
Grey
Beaver
's
squaw
taking
part
in
the
search
,
and
Mit-sah
,
*NL*
who
was
Grey
Beaver
's
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
trembled
with
fear
,
and
though
the
impulse
came
to
crawl
out
*NL*
of
his
hiding-place
,
he
resisted
it
.
After
a
time
the
voices
died
away
,
*NL*
and
some
time
after
that
he
crept
out
to
enjoy
the
success
of
his
*NL*
undertaking
.
Darkness
was
coming
on
,
and
for
a
while
he
played
about
*NL*
among
the
trees
,
pleasuring
in
his
freedom
.
Then
,
and
quite
suddenly
,
he
*NL*
became
aware
of
loneliness
.
He
sat
down
to
consider
,
listening
to
the
*NL*
silence
of
the
forest
and
perturbed
by
it
.
That
nothing
moved
nor
*NL*
sounded
,
seemed
ominous
.
He
felt
the
lurking
of
danger
,
unseen
and
*NL*
unguessed
.
He
was
suspicious
of
the
looming
bulks
of
the
trees
and
of
*NL*
the
dark
shadows
that
might
conceal
all
manner
of
perilous
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
cold
.
Here
was
no
warm
side
of
a
tepee
against
which
to
*NL*
snuggle
.
The
frost
was
in
his
feet
,
and
he
kept
lifting
first
one
fore
-
*NL*
foot
and
then
the
other
.
He
curved
his
bushy
tail
around
to
cover
them
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
he
saw
a
vision
.
There
was
nothing
strange
about
*NL*
it
.
Upon
his
inward
sight
was
impressed
a
succession
of
memory-pictures
.
*NL*
He
saw
the
camp
again
,
the
tepees
,
and
the
blaze
of
the
fires
.
He
heard
*NL*
the
shrill
voices
of
the
women
,
the
gruff
basses
of
the
men
,
and
the
*NL*
snarling
of
the
dogs
.
He
was
hungry
,
and
he
remembered
pieces
of
meat
*NL*
and
fish
that
had
been
thrown
him
.
Here
was
no
meat
,
nothing
but
a
*NL*
threatening
and
inedible
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
bondage
had
softened
him
.
Irresponsibility
had
weakened
him
.
He
had
*NL*
forgotten
how
to
shift
for
himself
.
The
night
yawned
about
him
.
His
*NL*
senses
,
accustomed
to
the
hum
and
bustle
of
the
camp
,
used
to
the
*NL*
continuous
impact
of
sights
and
sounds
,
were
now
left
idle
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
to
do
,
nothing
to
see
nor
hear
.
They
strained
to
catch
some
*NL*
interruption
of
the
silence
and
immobility
of
nature
.
They
were
appalled
*NL*
by
inaction
and
by
the
feel
of
something
terrible
impending
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
a
great
start
of
fright
.
A
colossal
and
formless
something
was
*NL*
rushing
across
the
field
of
his
vision
.
It
was
a
tree-shadow
flung
by
*NL*
the
moon
,
from
whose
face
the
clouds
had
been
brushed
away
.
Reassured
,
*NL*
he
whimpered
softly
;
then
he
suppressed
the
whimper
for
fear
that
it
*NL*
might
attract
the
attention
of
the
lurking
dangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tree
,
contracting
in
the
cool
of
the
night
,
made
a
loud
noise
.
It
was
*NL*
directly
above
him
.
He
yelped
in
his
fright
.
A
panic
seized
him
,
and
he
*NL*
ran
madly
toward
the
village
.
He
knew
an
overpowering
desire
for
the
*NL*
protection
and
companionship
of
man
.
In
his
nostrils
was
the
smell
of
*NL*
the
camp-smoke
.
In
his
ears
the
camp-sounds
and
cries
were
ringing
loud
.
*NL*
He
passed
out
of
the
forest
and
into
the
moonlit
open
where
were
no
*NL*
shadows
nor
darknesses
.
But
no
village
greeted
his
eyes
.
He
had
*NL*
forgotten
.
The
village
had
gone
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wild
flight
ceased
abruptly
.
There
was
no
place
to
which
to
flee
.
He
*NL*
slunk
forlornly
through
the
deserted
camp
,
smelling
the
rubbish-heaps
and
*NL*
the
discarded
rags
and
tags
of
the
gods
.
He
would
have
been
glad
for
the
*NL*
rattle
of
stones
about
him
,
flung
by
an
angry
squaw
,
glad
for
the
hand
of
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
descending
upon
him
in
wrath
;
while
he
would
have
welcomed
*NL*
with
delight
Lip-lip
and
the
whole
snarling
,
cowardly
pack
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
where
Grey
Beaver
's
tepee
had
stood
.
In
the
centre
of
the
*NL*
space
it
had
occupied
,
he
sat
down
.
He
pointed
his
nose
at
the
moon
.
His
*NL*
throat
was
afflicted
by
rigid
spasms
,
his
mouth
opened
,
and
in
a
heart
-
*NL*
broken
cry
bubbled
up
his
loneliness
and
fear
,
his
grief
for
Kiche
,
all
*NL*
his
past
sorrows
and
miseries
as
well
as
his
apprehension
of
sufferings
*NL*
and
dangers
to
come
.
It
was
the
long
wolf-howl
,
full-throated
and
*NL*
mournful
,
the
first
howl
he
had
ever
uttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coming
of
daylight
dispelled
his
fears
but
increased
his
loneliness
.
*NL*
The
naked
earth
,
which
so
shortly
before
had
been
so
populous
,
thrust
his
*NL*
loneliness
more
forcibly
upon
him
.
It
did
not
take
him
long
to
make
up
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
plunged
into
the
forest
and
followed
the
river
bank
down
*NL*
the
stream
.
All
day
he
ran
.
He
did
not
rest
.
He
seemed
made
to
run
on
*NL*
forever
.
His
iron-like
body
ignored
fatigue
.
And
even
after
fatigue
*NL*
came
,
his
heritage
of
endurance
braced
him
to
endless
endeavour
and
*NL*
enabled
him
to
drive
his
complaining
body
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
the
river
swung
in
against
precipitous
bluffs
,
he
climbed
the
high
*NL*
mountains
behind
.
Rivers
and
streams
that
entered
the
main
river
he
*NL*
forded
or
swam
.
Often
he
took
to
the
rim-ice
that
was
beginning
to
form
,
*NL*
and
more
than
once
he
crashed
through
and
struggled
for
life
in
the
icy
*NL*
current
.
Always
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
the
trail
of
the
gods
where
it
*NL*
might
leave
the
river
and
proceed
inland
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
was
intelligent
beyond
the
average
of
his
kind
;
yet
his
mental
*NL*
vision
was
not
wide
enough
to
embrace
the
other
bank
of
the
Mackenzie
.
*NL*
What
if
the
trail
of
the
gods
led
out
on
that
side
?
It
never
entered
his
*NL*
head
.
Later
on
,
when
he
had
travelled
more
and
grown
older
and
wiser
and
*NL*
come
to
know
more
of
trails
and
rivers
,
it
might
be
that
he
could
grasp
*NL*
and
apprehend
such
a
possibility
.
But
that
mental
power
was
yet
in
the
*NL*
future
.
Just
now
he
ran
blindly
,
his
own
bank
of
the
Mackenzie
alone
*NL*
entering
into
his
calculations
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
night
he
ran
,
blundering
in
the
darkness
into
mishaps
and
obstacles
*NL*
that
delayed
but
did
not
daunt
.
By
the
middle
of
the
second
day
he
had
*NL*
been
running
continuously
for
thirty
hours
,
and
the
iron
of
his
flesh
was
*NL*
giving
out
.
It
was
the
endurance
of
his
mind
that
kept
him
going
.
He
*NL*
had
not
eaten
in
forty
hours
,
and
he
was
weak
with
hunger
.
The
repeated
*NL*
drenchings
in
the
icy
water
had
likewise
had
their
effect
on
him
.
His
*NL*
handsome
coat
was
draggled
.
The
broad
pads
of
his
feet
were
bruised
and
*NL*
bleeding
.
He
had
begun
to
limp
,
and
this
limp
increased
with
the
hours
.
*NL*
To
make
it
worse
,
the
light
of
the
sky
was
obscured
and
snow
began
to
*NL*
fall
--
a
raw
,
moist
,
melting
,
clinging
snow
,
slippery
under
foot
,
that
hid
*NL*
from
him
the
landscape
he
traversed
,
and
that
covered
over
the
*NL*
inequalities
of
the
ground
so
that
the
way
of
his
feet
was
more
difficult
*NL*
and
painful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
had
intended
camping
that
night
on
the
far
bank
of
the
*NL*
Mackenzie
,
for
it
was
in
that
direction
that
the
hunting
lay
.
But
on
the
*NL*
near
bank
,
shortly
before
dark
,
a
moose
coming
down
to
drink
,
had
been
*NL*
espied
by
Kloo-kooch
,
who
was
Grey
Beaver
's
squaw
.
Now
,
had
not
the
*NL*
moose
come
down
to
drink
,
had
not
Mit-sah
been
steering
out
of
the
course
*NL*
because
of
the
snow
,
had
not
Kloo-kooch
sighted
the
moose
,
and
had
not
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
killed
it
with
a
lucky
shot
from
his
rifle
,
all
subsequent
*NL*
things
would
have
happened
differently
.
Grey
Beaver
would
not
have
*NL*
camped
on
the
near
side
of
the
Mackenzie
,
and
White
Fang
would
have
*NL*
passed
by
and
gone
on
,
either
to
die
or
to
find
his
way
to
his
wild
*NL*
brothers
and
become
one
of
them
--
a
wolf
to
the
end
of
his
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
had
fallen
.
The
snow
was
flying
more
thickly
,
and
White
Fang
,
*NL*
whimpering
softly
to
himself
as
he
stumbled
and
limped
along
,
came
upon
a
*NL*
fresh
trail
in
the
snow
.
So
fresh
was
it
that
he
knew
it
immediately
for
*NL*
what
it
was
.
Whining
with
eagerness
,
he
followed
back
from
the
river
*NL*
bank
and
in
among
the
trees
.
The
camp-sounds
came
to
his
ears
.
He
saw
*NL*
the
blaze
of
the
fire
,
Kloo-kooch
cooking
,
and
Grey
Beaver
squatting
on
*NL*
his
hams
and
mumbling
a
chunk
of
raw
tallow
.
There
was
fresh
meat
in
*NL*
camp
!
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
expected
a
beating
.
He
crouched
and
bristled
a
little
at
the
*NL*
thought
of
it
.
Then
he
went
forward
again
.
He
feared
and
disliked
the
*NL*
beating
he
knew
to
be
waiting
for
him
.
But
he
knew
,
further
,
that
the
*NL*
comfort
of
the
fire
would
be
his
,
the
protection
of
the
gods
,
the
*NL*
companionship
of
the
dogs
--
the
last
,
a
companionship
of
enmity
,
but
none
*NL*
the
less
a
companionship
and
satisfying
to
his
gregarious
needs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
cringing
and
crawling
into
the
firelight
.
Grey
Beaver
saw
him
,
*NL*
and
stopped
munching
the
tallow
.
White
Fang
crawled
slowly
,
cringing
and
*NL*
grovelling
in
the
abjectness
of
his
abasement
and
submission
.
He
crawled
*NL*
straight
toward
Grey
Beaver
,
every
inch
of
his
progress
becoming
slower
*NL*
and
more
painful
.
At
last
he
lay
at
the
master
's
feet
,
into
whose
*NL*
possession
he
now
surrendered
himself
,
voluntarily
,
body
and
soul
.
Of
*NL*
his
own
choice
,
he
came
in
to
sit
by
man
's
fire
and
to
be
ruled
by
him
.
*NL*
White
Fang
trembled
,
waiting
for
the
punishment
to
fall
upon
him
.
There
*NL*
was
a
movement
of
the
hand
above
him
.
He
cringed
involuntarily
under
the
*NL*
expected
blow
.
It
did
not
fall
.
He
stole
a
glance
upward
.
Grey
Beaver
*NL*
was
breaking
the
lump
of
tallow
in
half
!
Grey
Beaver
was
offering
him
*NL*
one
piece
of
the
tallow
!
Very
gently
and
somewhat
suspiciously
,
he
first
*NL*
smelled
the
tallow
and
then
proceeded
to
eat
it
.
Grey
Beaver
ordered
*NL*
meat
to
be
brought
to
him
,
and
guarded
him
from
the
other
dogs
while
he
*NL*
ate
.
After
that
,
grateful
and
content
,
White
Fang
lay
at
Grey
Beaver
's
*NL*
feet
,
gazing
at
the
fire
that
warmed
him
,
blinking
and
dozing
,
secure
in
*NL*
the
knowledge
that
the
morrow
would
find
him
,
not
wandering
forlorn
*NL*
through
bleak
forest-stretches
,
but
in
the
camp
of
the
man-animals
,
with
*NL*
the
gods
to
whom
he
had
given
himself
and
upon
whom
he
was
now
dependent
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
COVENANT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
December
was
well
along
,
Grey
Beaver
went
on
a
journey
up
the
*NL*
Mackenzie
.
Mit-sah
and
Kloo-kooch
went
with
him
.
One
sled
he
drove
*NL*
himself
,
drawn
by
dogs
he
had
traded
for
or
borrowed
.
A
second
and
*NL*
smaller
sled
was
driven
by
Mit-sah
,
and
to
this
was
harnessed
a
team
of
*NL*
puppies
.
It
was
more
of
a
toy
affair
than
anything
else
,
yet
it
was
the
*NL*
delight
of
Mit-sah
,
who
felt
that
he
was
beginning
to
do
a
man
's
work
in
*NL*
the
world
.
Also
,
he
was
learning
to
drive
dogs
and
to
train
dogs
;
while
*NL*
the
puppies
themselves
were
being
broken
in
to
the
harness
.
Furthermore
,
*NL*
the
sled
was
of
some
service
,
for
it
carried
nearly
two
hundred
pounds
of
*NL*
outfit
and
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
had
seen
the
camp-dogs
toiling
in
the
harness
,
so
that
he
did
*NL*
not
resent
overmuch
the
first
placing
of
the
harness
upon
himself
.
About
*NL*
his
neck
was
put
a
moss-stuffed
collar
,
which
was
connected
by
two
*NL*
pulling-traces
to
a
strap
that
passed
around
his
chest
and
over
his
back
.
*NL*
It
was
to
this
that
was
fastened
the
long
rope
by
which
he
pulled
at
the
*NL*
sled
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
seven
puppies
in
the
team
.
The
others
had
been
born
earlier
*NL*
in
the
year
and
were
nine
and
ten
months
old
,
while
White
Fang
was
only
*NL*
eight
months
old
.
Each
dog
was
fastened
to
the
sled
by
a
single
rope
.
No
*NL*
two
ropes
were
of
the
same
length
,
while
the
difference
in
length
between
*NL*
any
two
ropes
was
at
least
that
of
a
dog
's
body
.
Every
rope
was
brought
*NL*
to
a
ring
at
the
front
end
of
the
sled
.
The
sled
itself
was
without
*NL*
runners
,
being
a
birch-bark
toboggan
,
with
upturned
forward
end
to
keep
*NL*
it
from
ploughing
under
the
snow
.
This
construction
enabled
the
weight
*NL*
of
the
sled
and
load
to
be
distributed
over
the
largest
snow-surface
;
for
*NL*
the
snow
was
crystal-powder
and
very
soft
.
Observing
the
same
principle
*NL*
of
widest
distribution
of
weight
,
the
dogs
at
the
ends
of
their
ropes
*NL*
radiated
fan-fashion
from
the
nose
of
the
sled
,
so
that
no
dog
trod
in
*NL*
another
's
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
furthermore
,
another
virtue
in
the
fan-formation
.
The
ropes
*NL*
of
varying
length
prevented
the
dogs
attacking
from
the
rear
those
that
*NL*
ran
in
front
of
them
.
For
a
dog
to
attack
another
,
it
would
have
to
turn
*NL*
upon
one
at
a
shorter
rope
.
In
which
case
it
would
find
itself
face
to
*NL*
face
with
the
dog
attacked
,
and
also
it
would
find
itself
facing
the
whip
*NL*
of
the
driver
.
But
the
most
peculiar
virtue
of
all
lay
in
the
fact
that
*NL*
the
dog
that
strove
to
attack
one
in
front
of
him
must
pull
the
sled
*NL*
faster
,
and
that
the
faster
the
sled
travelled
,
the
faster
could
the
dog
*NL*
attacked
run
away
.
Thus
,
the
dog
behind
could
never
catch
up
with
the
*NL*
one
in
front
.
The
faster
he
ran
,
the
faster
ran
the
one
he
was
after
,
*NL*
and
the
faster
ran
all
the
dogs
.
Incidentally
,
the
sled
went
faster
,
and
*NL*
thus
,
by
cunning
indirection
,
did
man
increase
his
mastery
over
the
*NL*
beasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mit-sah
resembled
his
father
,
much
of
whose
grey
wisdom
he
possessed
.
In
*NL*
the
past
he
had
observed
Lip-lip
's
persecution
of
White
Fang
;
but
at
that
*NL*
time
Lip-lip
was
another
man
's
dog
,
and
Mit-sah
had
never
dared
more
than
*NL*
to
shy
an
occasional
stone
at
him
.
But
now
Lip-lip
was
his
dog
,
and
he
*NL*
proceeded
to
wreak
his
vengeance
on
him
by
putting
him
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
longest
rope
.
This
made
Lip-lip
the
leader
,
and
was
apparently
an
*NL*
honour
!
but
in
reality
it
took
away
from
him
all
honour
,
and
instead
of
*NL*
being
bully
and
master
of
the
pack
,
he
now
found
himself
hated
and
*NL*
persecuted
by
the
pack
.
*NL*
*NL*
Because
he
ran
at
the
end
of
the
longest
rope
,
the
dogs
had
always
the
*NL*
view
of
him
running
away
before
them
.
All
that
they
saw
of
him
was
his
*NL*
bushy
tail
and
fleeing
hind
legs
--
a
view
far
less
ferocious
and
*NL*
intimidating
than
his
bristling
mane
and
gleaming
fangs
.
Also
,
dogs
*NL*
being
so
constituted
in
their
mental
ways
,
the
sight
of
him
running
away
*NL*
gave
desire
to
run
after
him
and
a
feeling
that
he
ran
away
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
the
sled
started
,
the
team
took
after
Lip-lip
in
a
chase
that
*NL*
extended
throughout
the
day
.
At
first
he
had
been
prone
to
turn
upon
his
*NL*
pursuers
,
jealous
of
his
dignity
and
wrathful
;
but
at
such
times
Mit-sah
*NL*
would
throw
the
stinging
lash
of
the
thirty-foot
cariboo-gut
whip
into
*NL*
his
face
and
compel
him
to
turn
tail
and
run
on
.
Lip-lip
might
face
the
*NL*
pack
,
but
he
could
not
face
that
whip
,
and
all
that
was
left
him
to
do
*NL*
was
to
keep
his
long
rope
taut
and
his
flanks
ahead
of
the
teeth
of
his
*NL*
mates
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
still
greater
cunning
lurked
in
the
recesses
of
the
Indian
mind
.
To
*NL*
give
point
to
unending
pursuit
of
the
leader
,
Mit-sah
favoured
him
over
*NL*
the
other
dogs
.
These
favours
aroused
in
them
jealousy
and
hatred
.
In
*NL*
their
presence
Mit-sah
would
give
him
meat
and
would
give
it
to
him
only
.
*NL*
This
was
maddening
to
them
.
They
would
rage
around
just
outside
the
*NL*
throwing-distance
of
the
whip
,
while
Lip-lip
devoured
the
meat
and
Mit
-
*NL*
sah
protected
him
.
And
when
there
was
no
meat
to
give
,
Mit-sah
would
*NL*
keep
the
team
at
a
distance
and
make
believe
to
give
meat
to
Lip-lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
took
kindly
to
the
work
.
He
had
travelled
a
greater
distance
*NL*
than
the
other
dogs
in
the
yielding
of
himself
to
the
rule
of
the
gods
,
*NL*
and
he
had
learned
more
thoroughly
the
futility
of
opposing
their
will
.
*NL*
In
addition
,
the
persecution
he
had
suffered
from
the
pack
had
made
the
*NL*
pack
less
to
him
in
the
scheme
of
things
,
and
man
more
.
He
had
not
*NL*
learned
to
be
dependent
on
his
kind
for
companionship
.
Besides
,
Kiche
*NL*
was
well-nigh
forgotten
;
and
the
chief
outlet
of
expression
that
remained
*NL*
to
him
was
in
the
allegiance
he
tendered
the
gods
he
had
accepted
as
*NL*
masters
.
So
he
worked
hard
,
learned
discipline
,
and
was
obedient
.
*NL*
Faithfulness
and
willingness
characterised
his
toil
.
These
are
essential
*NL*
traits
of
the
wolf
and
the
wild-dog
when
they
have
become
domesticated
,
*NL*
and
these
traits
White
Fang
possessed
in
unusual
measure
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
companionship
did
exist
between
White
Fang
and
the
other
dogs
,
but
it
*NL*
was
one
of
warfare
and
enmity
.
He
had
never
learned
to
play
with
them
.
*NL*
He
knew
only
how
to
fight
,
and
fight
with
them
he
did
,
returning
to
them
*NL*
a
hundred-fold
the
snaps
and
slashes
they
had
given
him
in
the
days
when
*NL*
Lip-lip
was
leader
of
the
pack
.
But
Lip-lip
was
no
longer
leader
--
except
*NL*
when
he
fled
away
before
his
mates
at
the
end
of
his
rope
,
the
sled
*NL*
bounding
along
behind
.
In
camp
he
kept
close
to
Mit-sah
or
Grey
Beaver
*NL*
or
Kloo-kooch
.
He
did
not
dare
venture
away
from
the
gods
,
for
now
the
*NL*
fangs
of
all
dogs
were
against
him
,
and
he
tasted
to
the
dregs
the
*NL*
persecution
that
had
been
White
Fang
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
overthrow
of
Lip-lip
,
White
Fang
could
have
become
leader
of
the
*NL*
pack
.
But
he
was
too
morose
and
solitary
for
that
.
He
merely
thrashed
*NL*
his
team-mates
.
Otherwise
he
ignored
them
.
They
got
out
of
his
way
when
*NL*
he
came
along
;
nor
did
the
boldest
of
them
ever
dare
to
rob
him
of
his
*NL*
meat
.
On
the
contrary
,
they
devoured
their
own
meat
hurriedly
,
for
fear
*NL*
that
he
would
take
it
away
from
them
.
White
Fang
knew
the
law
well
:
_
to
*NL*
oppress
the
weak
and
obey
the
strong
_
.
He
ate
his
share
of
meat
as
*NL*
rapidly
as
he
could
.
And
then
woe
the
dog
that
had
not
yet
finished
!
A
*NL*
snarl
and
a
flash
of
fangs
,
and
that
dog
would
wail
his
indignation
to
*NL*
the
uncomforting
stars
while
White
Fang
finished
his
portion
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
little
while
,
however
,
one
dog
or
another
would
flame
up
in
revolt
*NL*
and
be
promptly
subdued
.
Thus
White
Fang
was
kept
in
training
.
He
was
*NL*
jealous
of
the
isolation
in
which
he
kept
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
pack
,
and
he
fought
often
to
maintain
it
.
But
such
fights
were
of
brief
*NL*
duration
.
He
was
too
quick
for
the
others
.
They
were
slashed
open
and
*NL*
bleeding
before
they
knew
what
had
happened
,
were
whipped
almost
before
*NL*
they
had
begun
to
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
rigid
as
the
sled-discipline
of
the
gods
,
was
the
discipline
*NL*
maintained
by
White
Fang
amongst
his
fellows
.
He
never
allowed
them
any
*NL*
latitude
.
He
compelled
them
to
an
unremitting
respect
for
him
.
They
*NL*
might
do
as
they
pleased
amongst
themselves
.
That
was
no
concern
of
his
.
*NL*
But
it
_
was
_
his
concern
that
they
leave
him
alone
in
his
isolation
,
get
*NL*
out
of
his
way
when
he
elected
to
walk
among
them
,
and
at
all
times
*NL*
acknowledge
his
mastery
over
them
.
A
hint
of
stiff-leggedness
on
their
*NL*
part
,
a
lifted
lip
or
a
bristle
of
hair
,
and
he
would
be
upon
them
,
*NL*
merciless
and
cruel
,
swiftly
convincing
them
of
the
error
of
their
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
monstrous
tyrant
.
His
mastery
was
rigid
as
steel
.
He
oppressed
*NL*
the
weak
with
a
vengeance
.
Not
for
nothing
had
he
been
exposed
to
the
*NL*
pitiless
struggles
for
life
in
the
day
of
his
cubhood
,
when
his
mother
*NL*
and
he
,
alone
and
unaided
,
held
their
own
and
survived
in
the
ferocious
*NL*
environment
of
the
Wild
.
And
not
for
nothing
had
he
learned
to
walk
*NL*
softly
when
superior
strength
went
by
.
He
oppressed
the
weak
,
but
he
*NL*
respected
the
strong
.
And
in
the
course
of
the
long
journey
with
Grey
*NL*
Beaver
he
walked
softly
indeed
amongst
the
full-grown
dogs
in
the
camps
*NL*
of
the
strange
man-animals
they
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
months
passed
by
.
Still
continued
the
journey
of
Grey
Beaver
.
White
*NL*
Fang
's
strength
was
developed
by
the
long
hours
on
trail
and
the
steady
*NL*
toil
at
the
sled
;
and
it
would
have
seemed
that
his
mental
development
*NL*
was
well-nigh
complete
.
He
had
come
to
know
quite
thoroughly
the
world
*NL*
in
which
he
lived
.
His
outlook
was
bleak
and
materialistic
.
The
world
*NL*
as
he
saw
it
was
a
fierce
and
brutal
world
,
a
world
without
warmth
,
a
*NL*
world
in
which
caresses
and
affection
and
the
bright
sweetnesses
of
the
*NL*
spirit
did
not
exist
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
affection
for
Grey
Beaver
.
True
,
he
was
a
god
,
but
a
most
*NL*
savage
god
.
White
Fang
was
glad
to
acknowledge
his
lordship
,
but
it
was
*NL*
a
lordship
based
upon
superior
intelligence
and
brute
strength
.
There
*NL*
was
something
in
the
fibre
of
White
Fang
's
being
that
made
his
lordship
a
*NL*
thing
to
be
desired
,
else
he
would
not
have
come
back
from
the
Wild
when
*NL*
he
did
to
tender
his
allegiance
.
There
were
deeps
in
his
nature
which
*NL*
had
never
been
sounded
.
A
kind
word
,
a
caressing
touch
of
the
hand
,
on
*NL*
the
part
of
Grey
Beaver
,
might
have
sounded
these
deeps
;
but
Grey
Beaver
*NL*
did
not
caress
,
nor
speak
kind
words
.
It
was
not
his
way
.
His
primacy
*NL*
was
savage
,
and
savagely
he
ruled
,
administering
justice
with
a
club
,
*NL*
punishing
transgression
with
the
pain
of
a
blow
,
and
rewarding
merit
,
not
*NL*
by
kindness
,
but
by
withholding
a
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
White
Fang
knew
nothing
of
the
heaven
a
man
's
hand
might
contain
for
*NL*
him
.
Besides
,
he
did
not
like
the
hands
of
the
man-animals
.
He
was
*NL*
suspicious
of
them
.
It
was
true
that
they
sometimes
gave
meat
,
but
more
*NL*
often
they
gave
hurt
.
Hands
were
things
to
keep
away
from
.
They
hurled
*NL*
stones
,
wielded
sticks
and
clubs
and
whips
,
administered
slaps
and
*NL*
clouts
,
and
,
when
they
touched
him
,
were
cunning
to
hurt
with
pinch
and
*NL*
twist
and
wrench
.
In
strange
villages
he
had
encountered
the
hands
of
*NL*
the
children
and
learned
that
they
were
cruel
to
hurt
.
Also
,
he
had
once
*NL*
nearly
had
an
eye
poked
out
by
a
toddling
papoose
.
From
these
*NL*
experiences
he
became
suspicious
of
all
children
.
He
could
not
tolerate
*NL*
them
.
When
they
came
near
with
their
ominous
hands
,
he
got
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
a
village
at
the
Great
Slave
Lake
,
that
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
resenting
the
evil
of
the
hands
of
the
man-animals
,
he
came
to
modify
the
*NL*
law
that
he
had
learned
from
Grey
Beaver
:
namely
,
that
the
unpardonable
*NL*
crime
was
to
bite
one
of
the
gods
.
In
this
village
,
after
the
custom
of
*NL*
all
dogs
in
all
villages
,
White
Fang
went
foraging
,
for
food
.
A
boy
was
*NL*
chopping
frozen
moose-meat
with
an
axe
,
and
the
chips
were
flying
in
the
*NL*
snow
.
White
Fang
,
sliding
by
in
quest
of
meat
,
stopped
and
began
to
eat
*NL*
the
chips
.
He
observed
the
boy
lay
down
the
axe
and
take
up
a
stout
*NL*
club
.
White
Fang
sprang
clear
,
just
in
time
to
escape
the
descending
*NL*
blow
.
The
boy
pursued
him
,
and
he
,
a
stranger
in
the
village
,
fled
*NL*
between
two
tepees
to
find
himself
cornered
against
a
high
earth
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
escape
for
White
Fang
.
The
only
way
out
was
between
the
two
*NL*
tepees
,
and
this
the
boy
guarded
.
Holding
his
club
prepared
to
strike
,
*NL*
he
drew
in
on
his
cornered
quarry
.
White
Fang
was
furious
.
He
faced
the
*NL*
boy
,
bristling
and
snarling
,
his
sense
of
justice
outraged
.
He
knew
the
*NL*
law
of
forage
.
All
the
wastage
of
meat
,
such
as
the
frozen
chips
,
*NL*
belonged
to
the
dog
that
found
it
.
He
had
done
no
wrong
,
broken
no
law
,
*NL*
yet
here
was
this
boy
preparing
to
give
him
a
beating
.
White
Fang
*NL*
scarcely
knew
what
happened
.
He
did
it
in
a
surge
of
rage
.
And
he
did
*NL*
it
so
quickly
that
the
boy
did
not
know
either
.
All
the
boy
knew
was
*NL*
that
he
had
in
some
unaccountable
way
been
overturned
into
the
snow
,
and
*NL*
that
his
club-hand
had
been
ripped
wide
open
by
White
Fang
's
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
White
Fang
knew
that
he
had
broken
the
law
of
the
gods
.
He
had
*NL*
driven
his
teeth
into
the
sacred
flesh
of
one
of
them
,
and
could
expect
*NL*
nothing
but
a
most
terrible
punishment
.
He
fled
away
to
Grey
Beaver
,
*NL*
behind
whose
protecting
legs
he
crouched
when
the
bitten
boy
and
the
*NL*
boy
's
family
came
,
demanding
vengeance
.
But
they
went
away
with
*NL*
vengeance
unsatisfied
.
Grey
Beaver
defended
White
Fang
.
So
did
Mit-sah
*NL*
and
Kloo-kooch
.
White
Fang
,
listening
to
the
wordy
war
and
watching
the
*NL*
angry
gestures
,
knew
that
his
act
was
justified
.
And
so
it
came
that
he
*NL*
learned
there
were
gods
and
gods
.
There
were
his
gods
,
and
there
were
*NL*
other
gods
,
and
between
them
there
was
a
difference
.
Justice
or
*NL*
injustice
,
it
was
all
the
same
,
he
must
take
all
things
from
the
hands
of
*NL*
his
own
gods
.
But
he
was
not
compelled
to
take
injustice
from
the
other
*NL*
gods
.
It
was
his
privilege
to
resent
it
with
his
teeth
.
And
this
also
*NL*
was
a
law
of
the
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
day
was
out
,
White
Fang
was
to
learn
more
about
this
law
.
Mit
-
*NL*
sah
,
alone
,
gathering
firewood
in
the
forest
,
encountered
the
boy
that
*NL*
had
been
bitten
.
With
him
were
other
boys
.
Hot
words
passed
.
Then
all
*NL*
the
boys
attacked
Mit-sah
.
It
was
going
hard
with
him
.
Blows
were
*NL*
raining
upon
him
from
all
sides
.
White
Fang
looked
on
at
first
.
This
*NL*
was
an
affair
of
the
gods
,
and
no
concern
of
his
.
Then
he
realised
that
*NL*
this
was
Mit-sah
,
one
of
his
own
particular
gods
,
who
was
being
*NL*
maltreated
.
It
was
no
reasoned
impulse
that
made
White
Fang
do
what
he
*NL*
then
did
.
A
mad
rush
of
anger
sent
him
leaping
in
amongst
the
*NL*
combatants
.
Five
minutes
later
the
landscape
was
covered
with
fleeing
*NL*
boys
,
many
of
whom
dripped
blood
upon
the
snow
in
token
that
White
Fang
's
*NL*
teeth
had
not
been
idle
.
When
Mit-sah
told
the
story
in
camp
,
Grey
*NL*
Beaver
ordered
meat
to
be
given
to
White
Fang
.
He
ordered
much
meat
to
*NL*
be
given
,
and
White
Fang
,
gorged
and
sleepy
by
the
fire
,
knew
that
the
*NL*
law
had
received
its
verification
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
line
with
these
experiences
that
White
Fang
came
to
learn
the
*NL*
law
of
property
and
the
duty
of
the
defence
of
property
.
From
the
*NL*
protection
of
his
god
's
body
to
the
protection
of
his
god
's
possessions
*NL*
was
a
step
,
and
this
step
he
made
.
What
was
his
god
's
was
to
be
defended
*NL*
against
all
the
world
--
even
to
the
extent
of
biting
other
gods
.
Not
only
*NL*
was
such
an
act
sacrilegious
in
its
nature
,
but
it
was
fraught
with
*NL*
peril
.
The
gods
were
all-powerful
,
and
a
dog
was
no
match
against
them
;
*NL*
yet
White
Fang
learned
to
face
them
,
fiercely
belligerent
and
unafraid
.
*NL*
Duty
rose
above
fear
,
and
thieving
gods
learned
to
leave
Grey
Beaver
's
*NL*
property
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
,
in
this
connection
,
White
Fang
quickly
learnt
,
and
that
was
*NL*
that
a
thieving
god
was
usually
a
cowardly
god
and
prone
to
run
away
at
*NL*
the
sounding
of
the
alarm
.
Also
,
he
learned
that
but
brief
time
elapsed
*NL*
between
his
sounding
of
the
alarm
and
Grey
Beaver
coming
to
his
aid
.
He
*NL*
came
to
know
that
it
was
not
fear
of
him
that
drove
the
thief
away
,
but
*NL*
fear
of
Grey
Beaver
.
White
Fang
did
not
give
the
alarm
by
barking
.
He
*NL*
never
barked
.
His
method
was
to
drive
straight
at
the
intruder
,
and
to
*NL*
sink
his
teeth
in
if
he
could
.
Because
he
was
morose
and
solitary
,
*NL*
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
other
dogs
,
he
was
unusually
fitted
to
*NL*
guard
his
master
's
property
;
and
in
this
he
was
encouraged
and
trained
by
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
.
One
result
of
this
was
to
make
White
Fang
more
ferocious
*NL*
and
indomitable
,
and
more
solitary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
months
went
by
,
binding
stronger
and
stronger
the
covenant
between
*NL*
dog
and
man
.
This
was
the
ancient
covenant
that
the
first
wolf
that
came
*NL*
in
from
the
Wild
entered
into
with
man
.
And
,
like
all
succeeding
wolves
*NL*
and
wild
dogs
that
had
done
likewise
,
White
Fang
worked
the
covenant
out
*NL*
for
himself
.
The
terms
were
simple
.
For
the
possession
of
a
flesh-and
-
*NL*
blood
god
,
he
exchanged
his
own
liberty
.
Food
and
fire
,
protection
and
*NL*
companionship
,
were
some
of
the
things
he
received
from
the
god
.
In
*NL*
return
,
he
guarded
the
god
's
property
,
defended
his
body
,
worked
for
him
,
*NL*
and
obeyed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
possession
of
a
god
implies
service
.
White
Fang
's
was
a
service
of
*NL*
duty
and
awe
,
but
not
of
love
.
He
did
not
know
what
love
was
.
He
had
no
*NL*
experience
of
love
.
Kiche
was
a
remote
memory
.
Besides
,
not
only
had
he
*NL*
abandoned
the
Wild
and
his
kind
when
he
gave
himself
up
to
man
,
but
the
*NL*
terms
of
the
covenant
were
such
that
if
ever
he
met
Kiche
again
he
would
*NL*
not
desert
his
god
to
go
with
her
.
His
allegiance
to
man
seemed
somehow
*NL*
a
law
of
his
being
greater
than
the
love
of
liberty
,
of
kind
and
kin
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
FAMINE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
spring
of
the
year
was
at
hand
when
Grey
Beaver
finished
his
long
*NL*
journey
.
It
was
April
,
and
White
Fang
was
a
year
old
when
he
pulled
into
*NL*
the
home
villages
and
was
loosed
from
the
harness
by
Mit-sah
.
Though
a
*NL*
long
way
from
his
full
growth
,
White
Fang
,
next
to
Lip-lip
,
was
the
*NL*
largest
yearling
in
the
village
.
Both
from
his
father
,
the
wolf
,
and
*NL*
from
Kiche
,
he
had
inherited
stature
and
strength
,
and
already
he
was
*NL*
measuring
up
alongside
the
full-grown
dogs
.
But
he
had
not
yet
grown
*NL*
compact
.
His
body
was
slender
and
rangy
,
and
his
strength
more
stringy
*NL*
than
massive
.
His
coat
was
the
true
wolf-grey
,
and
to
all
appearances
he
*NL*
was
true
wolf
himself
.
The
quarter-strain
of
dog
he
had
inherited
from
*NL*
Kiche
had
left
no
mark
on
him
physically
,
though
it
had
played
its
part
*NL*
in
his
mental
make-up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
through
the
village
,
recognising
with
staid
satisfaction
the
*NL*
various
gods
he
had
known
before
the
long
journey
.
Then
there
were
the
*NL*
dogs
,
puppies
growing
up
like
himself
,
and
grown
dogs
that
did
not
look
*NL*
so
large
and
formidable
as
the
memory
pictures
he
retained
of
them
.
Also
,
*NL*
he
stood
less
in
fear
of
them
than
formerly
,
stalking
among
them
with
a
*NL*
certain
careless
ease
that
was
as
new
to
him
as
it
was
enjoyable
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
Baseek
,
a
grizzled
old
fellow
that
in
his
younger
days
had
but
*NL*
to
uncover
his
fangs
to
send
White
Fang
cringing
and
crouching
to
the
*NL*
right
about
.
From
him
White
Fang
had
learned
much
of
his
own
*NL*
insignificance
;
and
from
him
he
was
now
to
learn
much
of
the
change
and
*NL*
development
that
had
taken
place
in
himself
.
While
Baseek
had
been
*NL*
growing
weaker
with
age
,
White
Fang
had
been
growing
stronger
with
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
cutting-up
of
a
moose
,
fresh-killed
,
that
White
Fang
*NL*
learned
of
the
changed
relations
in
which
he
stood
to
the
dog-world
.
He
*NL*
had
got
for
himself
a
hoof
and
part
of
the
shin-bone
,
to
which
quite
a
*NL*
bit
of
meat
was
attached
.
Withdrawn
from
the
immediate
scramble
of
the
*NL*
other
dogs
--
in
fact
out
of
sight
behind
a
thicket
--
he
was
devouring
his
*NL*
prize
,
when
Baseek
rushed
in
upon
him
.
Before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
,
*NL*
he
had
slashed
the
intruder
twice
and
sprung
clear
.
Baseek
was
surprised
*NL*
by
the
other
's
temerity
and
swiftness
of
attack
.
He
stood
,
gazing
*NL*
stupidly
across
at
White
Fang
,
the
raw
,
red
shin-bone
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Baseek
was
old
,
and
already
he
had
come
to
know
the
increasing
valour
of
*NL*
the
dogs
it
had
been
his
wont
to
bully
.
Bitter
experiences
these
,
which
,
*NL*
perforce
,
he
swallowed
,
calling
upon
all
his
wisdom
to
cope
with
them
.
In
*NL*
the
old
days
he
would
have
sprung
upon
White
Fang
in
a
fury
of
righteous
*NL*
wrath
.
But
now
his
waning
powers
would
not
permit
such
a
course
.
He
*NL*
bristled
fiercely
and
looked
ominously
across
the
shin-bone
at
White
*NL*
Fang
.
And
White
Fang
,
resurrecting
quite
a
deal
of
the
old
awe
,
seemed
*NL*
to
wilt
and
to
shrink
in
upon
himself
and
grow
small
,
as
he
cast
about
in
*NL*
his
mind
for
a
way
to
beat
a
retreat
not
too
inglorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
right
here
Baseek
erred
.
Had
he
contented
himself
with
looking
*NL*
fierce
and
ominous
,
all
would
have
been
well
.
White
Fang
,
on
the
verge
*NL*
of
retreat
,
would
have
retreated
,
leaving
the
meat
to
him
.
But
Baseek
*NL*
did
not
wait
.
He
considered
the
victory
already
his
and
stepped
forward
*NL*
to
the
meat
.
As
he
bent
his
head
carelessly
to
smell
it
,
White
Fang
*NL*
bristled
slightly
.
Even
then
it
was
not
too
late
for
Baseek
to
retrieve
*NL*
the
situation
.
Had
he
merely
stood
over
the
meat
,
head
up
and
glowering
,
*NL*
White
Fang
would
ultimately
have
slunk
away
.
But
the
fresh
meat
was
*NL*
strong
in
Baseek
's
nostrils
,
and
greed
urged
him
to
take
a
bite
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
too
much
for
White
Fang
.
Fresh
upon
his
months
of
mastery
over
*NL*
his
own
team-mates
,
it
was
beyond
his
self-control
to
stand
idly
by
while
*NL*
another
devoured
the
meat
that
belonged
to
him
.
He
struck
,
after
his
*NL*
custom
,
without
warning
.
With
the
first
slash
,
Baseek
's
right
ear
was
*NL*
ripped
into
ribbons
.
He
was
astounded
at
the
suddenness
of
it
.
But
more
*NL*
things
,
and
most
grievous
ones
,
were
happening
with
equal
suddenness
.
He
*NL*
was
knocked
off
his
feet
.
His
throat
was
bitten
.
While
he
was
*NL*
struggling
to
his
feet
the
young
dog
sank
teeth
twice
into
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
The
swiftness
of
it
was
bewildering
.
He
made
a
futile
rush
at
White
*NL*
Fang
,
clipping
the
empty
air
with
an
outraged
snap
.
The
next
moment
his
*NL*
nose
was
laid
open
,
and
he
was
staggering
backward
away
from
the
meat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
was
now
reversed
.
White
Fang
stood
over
the
shin-bone
,
*NL*
bristling
and
menacing
,
while
Baseek
stood
a
little
way
off
,
preparing
to
*NL*
retreat
.
He
dared
not
risk
a
fight
with
this
young
lightning-flash
,
and
*NL*
again
he
knew
,
and
more
bitterly
,
the
enfeeblement
of
oncoming
age
.
His
*NL*
attempt
to
maintain
his
dignity
was
heroic
.
Calmly
turning
his
back
upon
*NL*
young
dog
and
shin-bone
,
as
though
both
were
beneath
his
notice
and
*NL*
unworthy
of
his
consideration
,
he
stalked
grandly
away
.
Nor
,
until
well
*NL*
out
of
sight
,
did
he
stop
to
lick
his
bleeding
wounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
on
White
Fang
was
to
give
him
a
greater
faith
in
himself
,
and
*NL*
a
greater
pride
.
He
walked
less
softly
among
the
grown
dogs
;
his
*NL*
attitude
toward
them
was
less
compromising
.
Not
that
he
went
out
of
his
*NL*
way
looking
for
trouble
.
Far
from
it
.
But
upon
his
way
he
demanded
*NL*
consideration
.
He
stood
upon
his
right
to
go
his
way
unmolested
and
to
*NL*
give
trail
to
no
dog
.
He
had
to
be
taken
into
account
,
that
was
all
.
He
*NL*
was
no
longer
to
be
disregarded
and
ignored
,
as
was
the
lot
of
puppies
,
*NL*
and
as
continued
to
be
the
lot
of
the
puppies
that
were
his
team-mates
.
*NL*
They
got
out
of
the
way
,
gave
trail
to
the
grown
dogs
,
and
gave
up
meat
*NL*
to
them
under
compulsion
.
But
White
Fang
,
uncompanionable
,
solitary
,
*NL*
morose
,
scarcely
looking
to
right
or
left
,
redoubtable
,
forbidding
of
*NL*
aspect
,
remote
and
alien
,
was
accepted
as
an
equal
by
his
puzzled
elders
.
*NL*
They
quickly
learned
to
leave
him
alone
,
neither
venturing
hostile
acts
*NL*
nor
making
overtures
of
friendliness
.
If
they
left
him
alone
,
he
left
*NL*
them
alone
--
a
state
of
affairs
that
they
found
,
after
a
few
encounters
,
*NL*
to
be
pre-eminently
desirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
midsummer
White
Fang
had
an
experience
.
Trotting
along
in
his
silent
*NL*
way
to
investigate
a
new
tepee
which
had
been
erected
on
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
village
while
he
was
away
with
the
hunters
after
moose
,
he
came
full
upon
*NL*
Kiche
.
He
paused
and
looked
at
her
.
He
remembered
her
vaguely
,
but
he
*NL*
_
remembered
_
her
,
and
that
was
more
than
could
be
said
for
her
.
She
*NL*
lifted
her
lip
at
him
in
the
old
snarl
of
menace
,
and
his
memory
became
*NL*
clear
.
His
forgotten
cubhood
,
all
that
was
associated
with
that
familiar
*NL*
snarl
,
rushed
back
to
him
.
Before
he
had
known
the
gods
,
she
had
been
to
*NL*
him
the
centre-pin
of
the
universe
.
The
old
familiar
feelings
of
that
*NL*
time
came
back
upon
him
,
surged
up
within
him
.
He
bounded
towards
her
*NL*
joyously
,
and
she
met
him
with
shrewd
fangs
that
laid
his
cheek
open
to
*NL*
the
bone
.
He
did
not
understand
.
He
backed
away
,
bewildered
and
*NL*
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
Kiche
's
fault
.
A
wolf-mother
was
not
made
to
remember
her
*NL*
cubs
of
a
year
or
so
before
.
So
she
did
not
remember
White
Fang
.
He
was
*NL*
a
strange
animal
,
an
intruder
;
and
her
present
litter
of
puppies
gave
her
*NL*
the
right
to
resent
such
intrusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
puppies
sprawled
up
to
White
Fang
.
They
were
half-brothers
,
*NL*
only
they
did
not
know
it
.
White
Fang
sniffed
the
puppy
curiously
,
*NL*
whereupon
Kiche
rushed
upon
him
,
gashing
his
face
a
second
time
.
He
*NL*
backed
farther
away
.
All
the
old
memories
and
associations
died
down
*NL*
again
and
passed
into
the
grave
from
which
they
had
been
resurrected
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
Kiche
licking
her
puppy
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
snarl
at
*NL*
him
.
She
was
without
value
to
him
.
He
had
learned
to
get
along
without
*NL*
her
.
Her
meaning
was
forgotten
.
There
was
no
place
for
her
in
his
*NL*
scheme
of
things
,
as
there
was
no
place
for
him
in
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
standing
,
stupid
and
bewildered
,
the
memories
forgotten
,
*NL*
wondering
what
it
was
all
about
,
when
Kiche
attacked
him
a
third
time
,
*NL*
intent
on
driving
him
away
altogether
from
the
vicinity
.
And
White
Fang
*NL*
allowed
himself
to
be
driven
away
.
This
was
a
female
of
his
kind
,
and
it
*NL*
was
a
law
of
his
kind
that
the
males
must
not
fight
the
females
.
He
did
*NL*
not
know
anything
about
this
law
,
for
it
was
no
generalisation
of
the
*NL*
mind
,
not
a
something
acquired
by
experience
of
the
world
.
He
knew
it
as
*NL*
a
secret
prompting
,
as
an
urge
of
instinct
--
of
the
same
instinct
that
*NL*
made
him
howl
at
the
moon
and
stars
of
nights
,
and
that
made
him
fear
*NL*
death
and
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
months
went
by
.
White
Fang
grew
stronger
,
heavier
,
and
more
compact
,
*NL*
while
his
character
was
developing
along
the
lines
laid
down
by
his
*NL*
heredity
and
his
environment
.
His
heredity
was
a
life-stuff
that
may
be
*NL*
likened
to
clay
.
It
possessed
many
possibilities
,
was
capable
of
being
*NL*
moulded
into
many
different
forms
.
Environment
served
to
model
the
clay
,
*NL*
to
give
it
a
particular
form
.
Thus
,
had
White
Fang
never
come
in
to
the
*NL*
fires
of
man
,
the
Wild
would
have
moulded
him
into
a
true
wolf
.
But
the
*NL*
gods
had
given
him
a
different
environment
,
and
he
was
moulded
into
a
dog
*NL*
that
was
rather
wolfish
,
but
that
was
a
dog
and
not
a
wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
according
to
the
clay
of
his
nature
and
the
pressure
of
his
*NL*
surroundings
,
his
character
was
being
moulded
into
a
certain
particular
*NL*
shape
.
There
was
no
escaping
it
.
He
was
becoming
more
morose
,
more
*NL*
uncompanionable
,
more
solitary
,
more
ferocious
;
while
the
dogs
were
*NL*
learning
more
and
more
that
it
was
better
to
be
at
peace
with
him
than
at
*NL*
war
,
and
Grey
Beaver
was
coming
to
prize
him
more
greatly
with
the
*NL*
passage
of
each
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
,
seeming
to
sum
up
strength
in
all
his
qualities
,
nevertheless
*NL*
suffered
from
one
besetting
weakness
.
He
could
not
stand
being
laughed
*NL*
at
.
The
laughter
of
men
was
a
hateful
thing
.
They
might
laugh
among
*NL*
themselves
about
anything
they
pleased
except
himself
,
and
he
did
not
*NL*
mind
.
But
the
moment
laughter
was
turned
upon
him
he
would
fly
into
a
*NL*
most
terrible
rage
.
Grave
,
dignified
,
sombre
,
a
laugh
made
him
frantic
*NL*
to
ridiculousness
.
It
so
outraged
him
and
upset
him
that
for
hours
he
*NL*
would
behave
like
a
demon
.
And
woe
to
the
dog
that
at
such
times
ran
*NL*
foul
of
him
.
He
knew
the
law
too
well
to
take
it
out
of
Grey
Beaver
;
*NL*
behind
Grey
Beaver
were
a
club
and
godhead
.
But
behind
the
dogs
there
*NL*
was
nothing
but
space
,
and
into
this
space
they
flew
when
White
Fang
came
*NL*
on
the
scene
,
made
mad
by
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
third
year
of
his
life
there
came
a
great
famine
to
the
Mackenzie
*NL*
Indians
.
In
the
summer
the
fish
failed
.
In
the
winter
the
cariboo
*NL*
forsook
their
accustomed
track
.
Moose
were
scarce
,
the
rabbits
almost
*NL*
disappeared
,
hunting
and
preying
animals
perished
.
Denied
their
usual
*NL*
food-supply
,
weakened
by
hunger
,
they
fell
upon
and
devoured
one
another
.
*NL*
Only
the
strong
survived
.
White
Fang
's
gods
were
always
hunting
animals
.
*NL*
The
old
and
the
weak
of
them
died
of
hunger
.
There
was
wailing
in
the
*NL*
village
,
where
the
women
and
children
went
without
in
order
that
what
*NL*
little
they
had
might
go
into
the
bellies
of
the
lean
and
hollow-eyed
*NL*
hunters
who
trod
the
forest
in
the
vain
pursuit
of
meat
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
such
extremity
were
the
gods
driven
that
they
ate
the
soft-tanned
*NL*
leather
of
their
mocassins
and
mittens
,
while
the
dogs
ate
the
harnesses
*NL*
off
their
backs
and
the
very
whip-lashes
.
Also
,
the
dogs
ate
one
*NL*
another
,
and
also
the
gods
ate
the
dogs
.
The
weakest
and
the
more
*NL*
worthless
were
eaten
first
.
The
dogs
that
still
lived
,
looked
on
and
*NL*
understood
.
A
few
of
the
boldest
and
wisest
forsook
the
fires
of
the
*NL*
gods
,
which
had
now
become
a
shambles
,
and
fled
into
the
forest
,
where
,
*NL*
in
the
end
,
they
starved
to
death
or
were
eaten
by
wolves
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
time
of
misery
,
White
Fang
,
too
,
stole
away
into
the
woods
.
He
*NL*
was
better
fitted
for
the
life
than
the
other
dogs
,
for
he
had
the
*NL*
training
of
his
cubhood
to
guide
him
.
Especially
adept
did
he
become
in
*NL*
stalking
small
living
things
.
He
would
lie
concealed
for
hours
,
*NL*
following
every
movement
of
a
cautious
tree-squirrel
,
waiting
,
with
a
*NL*
patience
as
huge
as
the
hunger
he
suffered
from
,
until
the
squirrel
*NL*
ventured
out
upon
the
ground
.
Even
then
,
White
Fang
was
not
premature
.
*NL*
He
waited
until
he
was
sure
of
striking
before
the
squirrel
could
gain
a
*NL*
tree-refuge
.
Then
,
and
not
until
then
,
would
he
flash
from
his
hiding
-
*NL*
place
,
a
grey
projectile
,
incredibly
swift
,
never
failing
its
mark
--
the
*NL*
fleeing
squirrel
that
fled
not
fast
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Successful
as
he
was
with
squirrels
,
there
was
one
difficulty
that
*NL*
prevented
him
from
living
and
growing
fat
on
them
.
There
were
not
enough
*NL*
squirrels
.
So
he
was
driven
to
hunt
still
smaller
things
.
So
acute
did
*NL*
his
hunger
become
at
times
that
he
was
not
above
rooting
out
wood-mice
*NL*
from
their
burrows
in
the
ground
.
Nor
did
he
scorn
to
do
battle
with
a
*NL*
weasel
as
hungry
as
himself
and
many
times
more
ferocious
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
worst
pinches
of
the
famine
he
stole
back
to
the
fires
of
the
*NL*
gods
.
But
he
did
not
go
into
the
fires
.
He
lurked
in
the
forest
,
*NL*
avoiding
discovery
and
robbing
the
snares
at
the
rare
intervals
when
game
*NL*
was
caught
.
He
even
robbed
Grey
Beaver
's
snare
of
a
rabbit
at
a
time
*NL*
when
Grey
Beaver
staggered
and
tottered
through
the
forest
,
sitting
down
*NL*
often
to
rest
,
what
of
weakness
and
of
shortness
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
White
Fang
encountered
a
young
wolf
,
gaunt
and
scrawny
,
loose
-
*NL*
jointed
with
famine
.
Had
he
not
been
hungry
himself
,
White
Fang
might
*NL*
have
gone
with
him
and
eventually
found
his
way
into
the
pack
amongst
his
*NL*
wild
brethren
.
As
it
was
,
he
ran
the
young
wolf
down
and
killed
and
ate
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortune
seemed
to
favour
him
.
Always
,
when
hardest
pressed
for
food
,
he
*NL*
found
something
to
kill
.
Again
,
when
he
was
weak
,
it
was
his
luck
that
*NL*
none
of
the
larger
preying
animals
chanced
upon
him
.
Thus
,
he
was
strong
*NL*
from
the
two
days
'
eating
a
lynx
had
afforded
him
when
the
hungry
wolf
-
*NL*
pack
ran
full
tilt
upon
him
.
It
was
a
long
,
cruel
chase
,
but
he
was
*NL*
better
nourished
than
they
,
and
in
the
end
outran
them
.
And
not
only
did
*NL*
he
outrun
them
,
but
,
circling
widely
back
on
his
track
,
he
gathered
in
*NL*
one
of
his
exhausted
pursuers
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
he
left
that
part
of
the
country
and
journeyed
over
to
the
*NL*
valley
wherein
he
had
been
born
.
Here
,
in
the
old
lair
,
he
encountered
*NL*
Kiche
.
Up
to
her
old
tricks
,
she
,
too
,
had
fled
the
inhospitable
fires
*NL*
of
the
gods
and
gone
back
to
her
old
refuge
to
give
birth
to
her
young
.
*NL*
Of
this
litter
but
one
remained
alive
when
White
Fang
came
upon
the
*NL*
scene
,
and
this
one
was
not
destined
to
live
long
.
Young
life
had
little
*NL*
chance
in
such
a
famine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kiche
's
greeting
of
her
grown
son
was
anything
but
affectionate
.
But
*NL*
White
Fang
did
not
mind
.
He
had
outgrown
his
mother
.
So
he
turned
tail
*NL*
philosophically
and
trotted
on
up
the
stream
.
At
the
forks
he
took
the
*NL*
turning
to
the
left
,
where
he
found
the
lair
of
the
lynx
with
whom
his
*NL*
mother
and
he
had
fought
long
before
.
Here
,
in
the
abandoned
lair
,
he
*NL*
settled
down
and
rested
for
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
early
summer
,
in
the
last
days
of
the
famine
,
he
met
Lip-lip
,
*NL*
who
had
likewise
taken
to
the
woods
,
where
he
had
eked
out
a
miserable
*NL*
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
came
upon
him
unexpectedly
.
Trotting
in
opposite
directions
*NL*
along
the
base
of
a
high
bluff
,
they
rounded
a
corner
of
rock
and
found
*NL*
themselves
face
to
face
.
They
paused
with
instant
alarm
,
and
looked
at
*NL*
each
other
suspiciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
was
in
splendid
condition
.
His
hunting
had
been
good
,
and
for
*NL*
a
week
he
had
eaten
his
fill
.
He
was
even
gorged
from
his
latest
kill
.
*NL*
But
in
the
moment
he
looked
at
Lip-lip
his
hair
rose
on
end
all
along
his
*NL*
back
.
It
was
an
involuntary
bristling
on
his
part
,
the
physical
state
*NL*
that
in
the
past
had
always
accompanied
the
mental
state
produced
in
him
*NL*
by
Lip-lip
's
bullying
and
persecution
.
As
in
the
past
he
had
bristled
*NL*
and
snarled
at
sight
of
Lip-lip
,
so
now
,
and
automatically
,
he
bristled
*NL*
and
snarled
.
He
did
not
waste
any
time
.
The
thing
was
done
thoroughly
*NL*
and
with
despatch
.
Lip-lip
essayed
to
back
away
,
but
White
Fang
struck
*NL*
him
hard
,
shoulder
to
shoulder
.
Lip-lip
was
overthrown
and
rolled
upon
*NL*
his
back
.
White
Fang
's
teeth
drove
into
the
scrawny
throat
.
There
was
a
*NL*
death-struggle
,
during
which
White
Fang
walked
around
,
stiff-legged
and
*NL*
observant
.
Then
he
resumed
his
course
and
trotted
on
along
the
base
of
*NL*
the
bluff
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
not
long
after
,
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
,
where
a
*NL*
narrow
stretch
of
open
land
sloped
down
to
the
Mackenzie
.
He
had
been
*NL*
over
this
ground
before
,
when
it
was
bare
,
but
now
a
village
occupied
it
.
*NL*
Still
hidden
amongst
the
trees
,
he
paused
to
study
the
situation
.
Sights
*NL*
and
sounds
and
scents
were
familiar
to
him
.
It
was
the
old
village
*NL*
changed
to
a
new
place
.
But
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
were
different
*NL*
from
those
he
had
last
had
when
he
fled
away
from
it
.
There
was
no
*NL*
whimpering
nor
wailing
.
Contented
sounds
saluted
his
ear
,
and
when
he
*NL*
heard
the
angry
voice
of
a
woman
he
knew
it
to
be
the
anger
that
proceeds
*NL*
from
a
full
stomach
.
And
there
was
a
smell
in
the
air
of
fish
.
There
*NL*
was
food
.
The
famine
was
gone
.
He
came
out
boldly
from
the
forest
and
*NL*
trotted
into
camp
straight
to
Grey
Beaver
's
tepee
.
Grey
Beaver
was
not
*NL*
there
;
but
Kloo-kooch
welcomed
him
with
glad
cries
and
the
whole
of
a
*NL*
fresh-caught
fish
,
and
he
lay
down
to
wait
Grey
Beaver
's
coming
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
I
--
THE
ENEMY
OF
HIS
KIND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Had
there
been
in
White
Fang
's
nature
any
possibility
,
no
matter
how
*NL*
remote
,
of
his
ever
coming
to
fraternise
with
his
kind
,
such
possibility
*NL*
was
irretrievably
destroyed
when
he
was
made
leader
of
the
sled-team
.
For
*NL*
now
the
dogs
hated
him
--
hated
him
for
the
extra
meat
bestowed
upon
him
by
*NL*
Mit-sah
;
hated
him
for
all
the
real
and
fancied
favours
he
received
;
*NL*
hated
him
for
that
he
fled
always
at
the
head
of
the
team
,
his
waving
*NL*
brush
of
a
tail
and
his
perpetually
retreating
hind-quarters
for
ever
*NL*
maddening
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
White
Fang
just
as
bitterly
hated
them
back
.
Being
sled-leader
was
*NL*
anything
but
gratifying
to
him
.
To
be
compelled
to
run
away
before
the
*NL*
yelling
pack
,
every
dog
of
which
,
for
three
years
,
he
had
thrashed
and
*NL*
mastered
,
was
almost
more
than
he
could
endure
.
But
endure
it
he
must
,
*NL*
or
perish
,
and
the
life
that
was
in
him
had
no
desire
to
perish
out
.
The
*NL*
moment
Mit-sah
gave
his
order
for
the
start
,
that
moment
the
whole
team
,
*NL*
with
eager
,
savage
cries
,
sprang
forward
at
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
defence
for
him
.
If
he
turned
upon
them
,
Mit-sah
would
*NL*
throw
the
stinging
lash
of
the
whip
into
his
face
.
Only
remained
to
him
*NL*
to
run
away
.
He
could
not
encounter
that
howling
horde
with
his
tail
and
*NL*
hind-quarters
.
These
were
scarcely
fit
weapons
with
which
to
meet
the
*NL*
many
merciless
fangs
.
So
run
away
he
did
,
violating
his
own
nature
and
*NL*
pride
with
every
leap
he
made
,
and
leaping
all
day
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
can
not
violate
the
promptings
of
one
's
nature
without
having
that
*NL*
nature
recoil
upon
itself
.
Such
a
recoil
is
like
that
of
a
hair
,
made
to
*NL*
grow
out
from
the
body
,
turning
unnaturally
upon
the
direction
of
its
*NL*
growth
and
growing
into
the
body
--
a
rankling
,
festering
thing
of
hurt
.
*NL*
And
so
with
White
Fang
.
Every
urge
of
his
being
impelled
him
to
spring
*NL*
upon
the
pack
that
cried
at
his
heels
,
but
it
was
the
will
of
the
gods
*NL*
that
this
should
not
be
;
and
behind
the
will
,
to
enforce
it
,
was
the
whip
*NL*
of
cariboo-gut
with
its
biting
thirty-foot
lash
.
So
White
Fang
could
*NL*
only
eat
his
heart
in
bitterness
and
develop
a
hatred
and
malice
*NL*
commensurate
with
the
ferocity
and
indomitability
of
his
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
ever
a
creature
was
the
enemy
of
its
kind
,
White
Fang
was
that
*NL*
creature
.
He
asked
no
quarter
,
gave
none
.
He
was
continually
marred
and
*NL*
scarred
by
the
teeth
of
the
pack
,
and
as
continually
he
left
his
own
*NL*
marks
upon
the
pack
.
Unlike
most
leaders
,
who
,
when
camp
was
made
and
*NL*
the
dogs
were
unhitched
,
huddled
near
to
the
gods
for
protection
,
White
*NL*
Fang
disdained
such
protection
.
He
walked
boldly
about
the
camp
,
*NL*
inflicting
punishment
in
the
night
for
what
he
had
suffered
in
the
day
.
*NL*
In
the
time
before
he
was
made
leader
of
the
team
,
the
pack
had
learned
*NL*
to
get
out
of
his
way
.
But
now
it
was
different
.
Excited
by
the
day
-
*NL*
long
pursuit
of
him
,
swayed
subconsciously
by
the
insistent
iteration
on
*NL*
their
brains
of
the
sight
of
him
fleeing
away
,
mastered
by
the
feeling
of
*NL*
mastery
enjoyed
all
day
,
the
dogs
could
not
bring
themselves
to
give
way
*NL*
to
him
.
When
he
appeared
amongst
them
,
there
was
always
a
squabble
.
His
*NL*
progress
was
marked
by
snarl
and
snap
and
growl
.
The
very
atmosphere
he
*NL*
breathed
was
surcharged
with
hatred
and
malice
,
and
this
but
served
to
*NL*
increase
the
hatred
and
malice
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mit-sah
cried
out
his
command
for
the
team
to
stop
,
White
Fang
*NL*
obeyed
.
At
first
this
caused
trouble
for
the
other
dogs
.
All
of
them
*NL*
would
spring
upon
the
hated
leader
only
to
find
the
tables
turned
.
Behind
*NL*
him
would
be
Mit-sah
,
the
great
whip
singing
in
his
hand
.
So
the
dogs
*NL*
came
to
understand
that
when
the
team
stopped
by
order
,
White
Fang
was
to
*NL*
be
let
alone
.
But
when
White
Fang
stopped
without
orders
,
then
it
was
*NL*
allowed
them
to
spring
upon
him
and
destroy
him
if
they
could
.
After
*NL*
several
experiences
,
White
Fang
never
stopped
without
orders
.
He
learned
*NL*
quickly
.
It
was
in
the
nature
of
things
,
that
he
must
learn
quickly
if
*NL*
he
were
to
survive
the
unusually
severe
conditions
under
which
life
was
*NL*
vouchsafed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
dogs
could
never
learn
the
lesson
to
leave
him
alone
in
camp
.
*NL*
Each
day
,
pursuing
him
and
crying
defiance
at
him
,
the
lesson
of
the
*NL*
previous
night
was
erased
,
and
that
night
would
have
to
be
learned
over
*NL*
again
,
to
be
as
immediately
forgotten
.
Besides
,
there
was
a
greater
*NL*
consistence
in
their
dislike
of
him
.
They
sensed
between
themselves
and
*NL*
him
a
difference
of
kind
--
cause
sufficient
in
itself
for
hostility
.
Like
*NL*
him
,
they
were
domesticated
wolves
.
But
they
had
been
domesticated
for
*NL*
generations
.
Much
of
the
Wild
had
been
lost
,
so
that
to
them
the
Wild
*NL*
was
the
unknown
,
the
terrible
,
the
ever-menacing
and
ever
warring
.
But
*NL*
to
him
,
in
appearance
and
action
and
impulse
,
still
clung
the
Wild
.
He
*NL*
symbolised
it
,
was
its
personification
:
so
that
when
they
showed
their
*NL*
teeth
to
him
they
were
defending
themselves
against
the
powers
of
*NL*
destruction
that
lurked
in
the
shadows
of
the
forest
and
in
the
dark
*NL*
beyond
the
camp-fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
one
lesson
the
dogs
did
learn
,
and
that
was
to
keep
*NL*
together
.
White
Fang
was
too
terrible
for
any
of
them
to
face
single
-
*NL*
handed
.
They
met
him
with
the
mass-formation
,
otherwise
he
would
have
*NL*
killed
them
,
one
by
one
,
in
a
night
.
As
it
was
,
he
never
had
a
chance
to
*NL*
kill
them
.
He
might
roll
a
dog
off
its
feet
,
but
the
pack
would
be
upon
*NL*
him
before
he
could
follow
up
and
deliver
the
deadly
throat-stroke
.
At
*NL*
the
first
hint
of
conflict
,
the
whole
team
drew
together
and
faced
him
.
*NL*
The
dogs
had
quarrels
among
themselves
,
but
these
were
forgotten
when
*NL*
trouble
was
brewing
with
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
try
as
they
would
,
they
could
not
kill
White
Fang
.
He
*NL*
was
too
quick
for
them
,
too
formidable
,
too
wise
.
He
avoided
tight
*NL*
places
and
always
backed
out
of
it
when
they
bade
fair
to
surround
him
.
*NL*
While
,
as
for
getting
him
off
his
feet
,
there
was
no
dog
among
them
*NL*
capable
of
doing
the
trick
.
His
feet
clung
to
the
earth
with
the
same
*NL*
tenacity
that
he
clung
to
life
.
For
that
matter
,
life
and
footing
were
*NL*
synonymous
in
this
unending
warfare
with
the
pack
,
and
none
knew
it
*NL*
better
than
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
became
the
enemy
of
his
kind
,
domesticated
wolves
that
they
were
,
*NL*
softened
by
the
fires
of
man
,
weakened
in
the
sheltering
shadow
of
man
's
*NL*
strength
.
White
Fang
was
bitter
and
implacable
.
The
clay
of
him
was
so
*NL*
moulded
.
He
declared
a
vendetta
against
all
dogs
.
And
so
terribly
did
*NL*
he
live
this
vendetta
that
Grey
Beaver
,
fierce
savage
himself
,
could
not
*NL*
but
marvel
at
White
Fang
's
ferocity
.
Never
,
he
swore
,
had
there
been
the
*NL*
like
of
this
animal
;
and
the
Indians
in
strange
villages
swore
likewise
*NL*
when
they
considered
the
tale
of
his
killings
amongst
their
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
White
Fang
was
nearly
five
years
old
,
Grey
Beaver
took
him
on
*NL*
another
great
journey
,
and
long
remembered
was
the
havoc
he
worked
*NL*
amongst
the
dogs
of
the
many
villages
along
the
Mackenzie
,
across
the
*NL*
Rockies
,
and
down
the
Porcupine
to
the
Yukon
.
He
revelled
in
the
*NL*
vengeance
he
wreaked
upon
his
kind
.
They
were
ordinary
,
unsuspecting
*NL*
dogs
.
They
were
not
prepared
for
his
swiftness
and
directness
,
for
his
*NL*
attack
without
warning
.
They
did
not
know
him
for
what
he
was
,
a
*NL*
lightning-flash
of
slaughter
.
They
bristled
up
to
him
,
stiff-legged
and
*NL*
challenging
,
while
he
,
wasting
no
time
on
elaborate
preliminaries
,
*NL*
snapping
into
action
like
a
steel
spring
,
was
at
their
throats
and
*NL*
destroying
them
before
they
knew
what
was
happening
and
while
they
were
*NL*
yet
in
the
throes
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
an
adept
at
fighting
.
He
economised
.
He
never
wasted
his
*NL*
strength
,
never
tussled
.
He
was
in
too
quickly
for
that
,
and
,
if
he
*NL*
missed
,
was
out
again
too
quickly
.
The
dislike
of
the
wolf
for
close
*NL*
quarters
was
his
to
an
unusual
degree
.
He
could
not
endure
a
prolonged
*NL*
contact
with
another
body
.
It
smacked
of
danger
.
It
made
him
frantic
.
*NL*
He
must
be
away
,
free
,
on
his
own
legs
,
touching
no
living
thing
.
It
was
*NL*
the
Wild
still
clinging
to
him
,
asserting
itself
through
him
.
This
*NL*
feeling
had
been
accentuated
by
the
Ishmaelite
life
he
had
led
from
his
*NL*
puppyhood
.
Danger
lurked
in
contacts
.
It
was
the
trap
,
ever
the
trap
,
*NL*
the
fear
of
it
lurking
deep
in
the
life
of
him
,
woven
into
the
fibre
of
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
consequence
,
the
strange
dogs
he
encountered
had
no
chance
against
*NL*
him
.
He
eluded
their
fangs
.
He
got
them
,
or
got
away
,
himself
untouched
*NL*
in
either
event
.
In
the
natural
course
of
things
there
were
exceptions
*NL*
to
this
.
There
were
times
when
several
dogs
,
pitching
on
to
him
,
*NL*
punished
him
before
he
could
get
away
;
and
there
were
times
when
a
single
*NL*
dog
scored
deeply
on
him
.
But
these
were
accidents
.
In
the
main
,
so
*NL*
efficient
a
fighter
had
he
become
,
he
went
his
way
unscathed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
advantage
he
possessed
was
that
of
correctly
judging
time
and
*NL*
distance
.
Not
that
he
did
this
consciously
,
however
.
He
did
not
*NL*
calculate
such
things
.
It
was
all
automatic
.
His
eyes
saw
correctly
,
*NL*
and
the
nerves
carried
the
vision
correctly
to
his
brain
.
The
parts
of
*NL*
him
were
better
adjusted
than
those
of
the
average
dog
.
They
worked
*NL*
together
more
smoothly
and
steadily
.
His
was
a
better
,
far
better
,
*NL*
nervous
,
mental
,
and
muscular
co-ordination
.
When
his
eyes
conveyed
to
*NL*
his
brain
the
moving
image
of
an
action
,
his
brain
without
conscious
*NL*
effort
,
knew
the
space
that
limited
that
action
and
the
time
required
for
*NL*
its
completion
.
Thus
,
he
could
avoid
the
leap
of
another
dog
,
or
the
*NL*
drive
of
its
fangs
,
and
at
the
same
moment
could
seize
the
infinitesimal
*NL*
fraction
of
time
in
which
to
deliver
his
own
attack
.
Body
and
brain
,
his
*NL*
was
a
more
perfected
mechanism
.
Not
that
he
was
to
be
praised
for
it
.
*NL*
Nature
had
been
more
generous
to
him
than
to
the
average
animal
,
that
was
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
summer
that
White
Fang
arrived
at
Fort
Yukon
.
Grey
Beaver
*NL*
had
crossed
the
great
watershed
between
Mackenzie
and
the
Yukon
in
the
*NL*
late
winter
,
and
spent
the
spring
in
hunting
among
the
western
outlying
*NL*
spurs
of
the
Rockies
.
Then
,
after
the
break-up
of
the
ice
on
the
*NL*
Porcupine
,
he
had
built
a
canoe
and
paddled
down
that
stream
to
where
it
*NL*
effected
its
junction
with
the
Yukon
just
under
the
Arctic
circle
.
Here
*NL*
stood
the
old
Hudson
's
Bay
Company
fort
;
and
here
were
many
Indians
,
much
*NL*
food
,
and
unprecedented
excitement
.
It
was
the
summer
of
1898
,
and
*NL*
thousands
of
gold-hunters
were
going
up
the
Yukon
to
Dawson
and
the
*NL*
Klondike
.
Still
hundreds
of
miles
from
their
goal
,
nevertheless
many
of
*NL*
them
had
been
on
the
way
for
a
year
,
and
the
least
any
of
them
had
*NL*
travelled
to
get
that
far
was
five
thousand
miles
,
while
some
had
come
*NL*
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Grey
Beaver
stopped
.
A
whisper
of
the
gold-rush
had
reached
his
*NL*
ears
,
and
he
had
come
with
several
bales
of
furs
,
and
another
of
gut-sewn
*NL*
mittens
and
moccasins
.
He
would
not
have
ventured
so
long
a
trip
had
he
*NL*
not
expected
generous
profits
.
But
what
he
had
expected
was
nothing
to
*NL*
what
he
realised
.
His
wildest
dreams
had
not
exceeded
a
hundred
per
*NL*
cent
.
profit
;
he
made
a
thousand
per
cent
.
And
like
a
true
Indian
,
he
*NL*
settled
down
to
trade
carefully
and
slowly
,
even
if
it
took
all
summer
*NL*
and
the
rest
of
the
winter
to
dispose
of
his
goods
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
Fort
Yukon
that
White
Fang
saw
his
first
white
men
.
As
*NL*
compared
with
the
Indians
he
had
known
,
they
were
to
him
another
race
of
*NL*
beings
,
a
race
of
superior
gods
.
They
impressed
him
as
possessing
*NL*
superior
power
,
and
it
is
on
power
that
godhead
rests
.
White
Fang
did
*NL*
not
reason
it
out
,
did
not
in
his
mind
make
the
sharp
generalisation
that
*NL*
the
white
gods
were
more
powerful
.
It
was
a
feeling
,
nothing
more
,
and
*NL*
yet
none
the
less
potent
.
As
,
in
his
puppyhood
,
the
looming
bulks
of
the
*NL*
tepees
,
man-reared
,
had
affected
him
as
manifestations
of
power
,
so
was
*NL*
he
affected
now
by
the
houses
and
the
huge
fort
all
of
massive
logs
.
Here
*NL*
was
power
.
Those
white
gods
were
strong
.
They
possessed
greater
mastery
*NL*
over
matter
than
the
gods
he
had
known
,
most
powerful
among
which
was
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
.
And
yet
Grey
Beaver
was
as
a
child-god
among
these
white
-
*NL*
skinned
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
,
White
Fang
only
felt
these
things
.
He
was
not
conscious
of
*NL*
them
.
Yet
it
is
upon
feeling
,
more
often
than
thinking
,
that
animals
*NL*
act
;
and
every
act
White
Fang
now
performed
was
based
upon
the
feeling
*NL*
that
the
white
men
were
the
superior
gods
.
In
the
first
place
he
was
*NL*
very
suspicious
of
them
.
There
was
no
telling
what
unknown
terrors
were
*NL*
theirs
,
what
unknown
hurts
they
could
administer
.
He
was
curious
to
*NL*
observe
them
,
fearful
of
being
noticed
by
them
.
For
the
first
few
hours
*NL*
he
was
content
with
slinking
around
and
watching
them
from
a
safe
*NL*
distance
.
Then
he
saw
that
no
harm
befell
the
dogs
that
were
near
to
*NL*
them
,
and
he
came
in
closer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
turn
he
was
an
object
of
great
curiosity
to
them
.
His
wolfish
*NL*
appearance
caught
their
eyes
at
once
,
and
they
pointed
him
out
to
one
*NL*
another
.
This
act
of
pointing
put
White
Fang
on
his
guard
,
and
when
they
*NL*
tried
to
approach
him
he
showed
his
teeth
and
backed
away
.
Not
one
*NL*
succeeded
in
laying
a
hand
on
him
,
and
it
was
well
that
they
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
soon
learned
that
very
few
of
these
gods
--
not
more
than
a
*NL*
dozen
--
lived
at
this
place
.
Every
two
or
three
days
a
steamer
-LRB-
another
*NL*
and
colossal
manifestation
of
power
-RRB-
came
into
the
bank
and
stopped
for
*NL*
several
hours
.
The
white
men
came
from
off
these
steamers
and
went
away
*NL*
on
them
again
.
There
seemed
untold
numbers
of
these
white
men
.
In
the
*NL*
first
day
or
so
,
he
saw
more
of
them
than
he
had
seen
Indians
in
all
his
*NL*
life
;
and
as
the
days
went
by
they
continued
to
come
up
the
river
,
stop
,
*NL*
and
then
go
on
up
the
river
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
the
white
gods
were
all-powerful
,
their
dogs
did
not
amount
to
*NL*
much
.
This
White
Fang
quickly
discovered
by
mixing
with
those
that
came
*NL*
ashore
with
their
masters
.
They
were
irregular
shapes
and
sizes
.
Some
*NL*
were
short-legged
--
too
short
;
others
were
long-legged
--
too
long
.
They
*NL*
had
hair
instead
of
fur
,
and
a
few
had
very
little
hair
at
that
.
And
*NL*
none
of
them
knew
how
to
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
an
enemy
of
his
kind
,
it
was
in
White
Fang
's
province
to
fight
with
*NL*
them
.
This
he
did
,
and
he
quickly
achieved
for
them
a
mighty
contempt
.
*NL*
They
were
soft
and
helpless
,
made
much
noise
,
and
floundered
around
*NL*
clumsily
trying
to
accomplish
by
main
strength
what
he
accomplished
by
*NL*
dexterity
and
cunning
.
They
rushed
bellowing
at
him
.
He
sprang
to
the
*NL*
side
.
They
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
him
;
and
in
that
moment
he
*NL*
struck
them
on
the
shoulder
,
rolling
them
off
their
feet
and
delivering
*NL*
his
stroke
at
the
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
this
stroke
was
successful
,
and
a
stricken
dog
rolled
in
the
*NL*
dirt
,
to
be
pounced
upon
and
torn
to
pieces
by
the
pack
of
Indian
dogs
*NL*
that
waited
.
White
Fang
was
wise
.
He
had
long
since
learned
that
the
*NL*
gods
were
made
angry
when
their
dogs
were
killed
.
The
white
men
were
no
*NL*
exception
to
this
.
So
he
was
content
,
when
he
had
overthrown
and
slashed
*NL*
wide
the
throat
of
one
of
their
dogs
,
to
drop
back
and
let
the
pack
go
in
*NL*
and
do
the
cruel
finishing
work
.
It
was
then
that
the
white
men
rushed
*NL*
in
,
visiting
their
wrath
heavily
on
the
pack
,
while
White
Fang
went
free
.
*NL*
He
would
stand
off
at
a
little
distance
and
look
on
,
while
stones
,
clubs
,
*NL*
axes
,
and
all
sorts
of
weapons
fell
upon
his
fellows
.
White
Fang
was
*NL*
very
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
fellows
grew
wise
in
their
own
way
;
and
in
this
White
Fang
grew
*NL*
wise
with
them
.
They
learned
that
it
was
when
a
steamer
first
tied
to
*NL*
the
bank
that
they
had
their
fun
.
After
the
first
two
or
three
strange
*NL*
dogs
had
been
downed
and
destroyed
,
the
white
men
hustled
their
own
*NL*
animals
back
on
board
and
wreaked
savage
vengeance
on
the
offenders
.
One
*NL*
white
man
,
having
seen
his
dog
,
a
setter
,
torn
to
pieces
before
his
eyes
,
*NL*
drew
a
revolver
.
He
fired
rapidly
,
six
times
,
and
six
of
the
pack
lay
*NL*
dead
or
dying
--
another
manifestation
of
power
that
sank
deep
into
White
*NL*
Fang
's
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
enjoyed
it
all
.
He
did
not
love
his
kind
,
and
he
was
shrewd
*NL*
enough
to
escape
hurt
himself
.
At
first
,
the
killing
of
the
white
men
's
*NL*
dogs
had
been
a
diversion
.
After
a
time
it
became
his
occupation
.
There
*NL*
was
no
work
for
him
to
do
.
Grey
Beaver
was
busy
trading
and
getting
*NL*
wealthy
.
So
White
Fang
hung
around
the
landing
with
the
disreputable
*NL*
gang
of
Indian
dogs
,
waiting
for
steamers
.
With
the
arrival
of
a
steamer
*NL*
the
fun
began
.
After
a
few
minutes
,
by
the
time
the
white
men
had
got
*NL*
over
their
surprise
,
the
gang
scattered
.
The
fun
was
over
until
the
next
*NL*
steamer
should
arrive
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
can
scarcely
be
said
that
White
Fang
was
a
member
of
the
gang
.
He
*NL*
did
not
mingle
with
it
,
but
remained
aloof
,
always
himself
,
and
was
even
*NL*
feared
by
it
.
It
is
true
,
he
worked
with
it
.
He
picked
the
quarrel
with
*NL*
the
strange
dog
while
the
gang
waited
.
And
when
he
had
overthrown
the
*NL*
strange
dog
the
gang
went
in
to
finish
it
.
But
it
is
equally
true
that
*NL*
he
then
withdrew
,
leaving
the
gang
to
receive
the
punishment
of
the
*NL*
outraged
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
require
much
exertion
to
pick
these
quarrels
.
All
he
had
to
*NL*
do
,
when
the
strange
dogs
came
ashore
,
was
to
show
himself
.
When
they
*NL*
saw
him
they
rushed
for
him
.
It
was
their
instinct
.
He
was
the
Wild
--
the
*NL*
unknown
,
the
terrible
,
the
ever-menacing
,
the
thing
that
prowled
in
the
*NL*
darkness
around
the
fires
of
the
primeval
world
when
they
,
cowering
close
*NL*
to
the
fires
,
were
reshaping
their
instincts
,
learning
to
fear
the
Wild
*NL*
out
of
which
they
had
come
,
and
which
they
had
deserted
and
betrayed
.
*NL*
Generation
by
generation
,
down
all
the
generations
,
had
this
fear
of
the
*NL*
Wild
been
stamped
into
their
natures
.
For
centuries
the
Wild
had
stood
*NL*
for
terror
and
destruction
.
And
during
all
this
time
free
licence
had
*NL*
been
theirs
,
from
their
masters
,
to
kill
the
things
of
the
Wild
.
In
*NL*
doing
this
they
had
protected
both
themselves
and
the
gods
whose
*NL*
companionship
they
shared
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
fresh
from
the
soft
southern
world
,
these
dogs
,
trotting
down
the
*NL*
gang-plank
and
out
upon
the
Yukon
shore
had
but
to
see
White
Fang
to
*NL*
experience
the
irresistible
impulse
to
rush
upon
him
and
destroy
him
.
*NL*
They
might
be
town-reared
dogs
,
but
the
instinctive
fear
of
the
Wild
was
*NL*
theirs
just
the
same
.
Not
alone
with
their
own
eyes
did
they
see
the
*NL*
wolfish
creature
in
the
clear
light
of
day
,
standing
before
them
.
They
*NL*
saw
him
with
the
eyes
of
their
ancestors
,
and
by
their
inherited
memory
*NL*
they
knew
White
Fang
for
the
wolf
,
and
they
remembered
the
ancient
feud
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
which
served
to
make
White
Fang
's
days
enjoyable
.
If
the
sight
of
*NL*
him
drove
these
strange
dogs
upon
him
,
so
much
the
better
for
him
,
so
*NL*
much
the
worse
for
them
.
They
looked
upon
him
as
legitimate
prey
,
and
as
*NL*
legitimate
prey
he
looked
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
for
nothing
had
he
first
seen
the
light
of
day
in
a
lonely
lair
and
*NL*
fought
his
first
fights
with
the
ptarmigan
,
the
weasel
,
and
the
lynx
.
And
*NL*
not
for
nothing
had
his
puppyhood
been
made
bitter
by
the
persecution
of
*NL*
Lip-lip
and
the
whole
puppy
pack
.
It
might
have
been
otherwise
,
and
he
*NL*
would
then
have
been
otherwise
.
Had
Lip-lip
not
existed
,
he
would
have
*NL*
passed
his
puppyhood
with
the
other
puppies
and
grown
up
more
doglike
and
*NL*
with
more
liking
for
dogs
.
Had
Grey
Beaver
possessed
the
plummet
of
*NL*
affection
and
love
,
he
might
have
sounded
the
deeps
of
White
Fang
's
*NL*
nature
and
brought
up
to
the
surface
all
manner
of
kindly
qualities
.
But
*NL*
these
things
had
not
been
so
.
The
clay
of
White
Fang
had
been
moulded
*NL*
until
he
became
what
he
was
,
morose
and
lonely
,
unloving
and
ferocious
,
*NL*
the
enemy
of
all
his
kind
.

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
MAD
GOD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
number
of
white
men
lived
in
Fort
Yukon
.
These
men
had
been
long
*NL*
in
the
country
.
They
called
themselves
Sour-doughs
,
and
took
great
pride
*NL*
in
so
classifying
themselves
.
For
other
men
,
new
in
the
land
,
they
felt
*NL*
nothing
but
disdain
.
The
men
who
came
ashore
from
the
steamers
were
*NL*
newcomers
.
They
were
known
as
_
chechaquos
_
,
and
they
always
wilted
at
*NL*
the
application
of
the
name
.
They
made
their
bread
with
baking-powder
.
*NL*
This
was
the
invidious
distinction
between
them
and
the
Sour-doughs
,
who
,
*NL*
forsooth
,
made
their
bread
from
sour-dough
because
they
had
no
baking
-
*NL*
powder
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
which
is
neither
here
nor
there
.
The
men
in
the
fort
disdained
*NL*
the
newcomers
and
enjoyed
seeing
them
come
to
grief
.
Especially
did
they
*NL*
enjoy
the
havoc
worked
amongst
the
newcomers
'
dogs
by
White
Fang
and
his
*NL*
disreputable
gang
.
When
a
steamer
arrived
,
the
men
of
the
fort
made
it
a
*NL*
point
always
to
come
down
to
the
bank
and
see
the
fun
.
They
looked
*NL*
forward
to
it
with
as
much
anticipation
as
did
the
Indian
dogs
,
while
*NL*
they
were
not
slow
to
appreciate
the
savage
and
crafty
part
played
by
*NL*
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
one
man
amongst
them
who
particularly
enjoyed
the
sport
.
He
*NL*
would
come
running
at
the
first
sound
of
a
steamboat
's
whistle
;
and
when
*NL*
the
last
fight
was
over
and
White
Fang
and
the
pack
had
scattered
,
he
*NL*
would
return
slowly
to
the
fort
,
his
face
heavy
with
regret
.
Sometimes
,
*NL*
when
a
soft
southland
dog
went
down
,
shrieking
its
death-cry
under
the
*NL*
fangs
of
the
pack
,
this
man
would
be
unable
to
contain
himself
,
and
would
*NL*
leap
into
the
air
and
cry
out
with
delight
.
And
always
he
had
a
sharp
*NL*
and
covetous
eye
for
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
was
called
``
Beauty
''
by
the
other
men
of
the
fort
.
No
one
knew
*NL*
his
first
name
,
and
in
general
he
was
known
in
the
country
as
Beauty
*NL*
Smith
.
But
he
was
anything
save
a
beauty
.
To
antithesis
was
due
his
*NL*
naming
.
He
was
pre-eminently
unbeautiful
.
Nature
had
been
niggardly
*NL*
with
him
.
He
was
a
small
man
to
begin
with
;
and
upon
his
meagre
frame
*NL*
was
deposited
an
even
more
strikingly
meagre
head
.
Its
apex
might
be
*NL*
likened
to
a
point
.
In
fact
,
in
his
boyhood
,
before
he
had
been
named
*NL*
Beauty
by
his
fellows
,
he
had
been
called
``
Pinhead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Backward
,
from
the
apex
,
his
head
slanted
down
to
his
neck
and
forward
it
*NL*
slanted
uncompromisingly
to
meet
a
low
and
remarkably
wide
forehead
.
*NL*
Beginning
here
,
as
though
regretting
her
parsimony
,
Nature
had
spread
his
*NL*
features
with
a
lavish
hand
.
His
eyes
were
large
,
and
between
them
was
*NL*
the
distance
of
two
eyes
.
His
face
,
in
relation
to
the
rest
of
him
,
was
*NL*
prodigious
.
In
order
to
discover
the
necessary
area
,
Nature
had
given
*NL*
him
an
enormous
prognathous
jaw
.
It
was
wide
and
heavy
,
and
protruded
*NL*
outward
and
down
until
it
seemed
to
rest
on
his
chest
.
Possibly
this
*NL*
appearance
was
due
to
the
weariness
of
the
slender
neck
,
unable
properly
*NL*
to
support
so
great
a
burden
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
jaw
gave
the
impression
of
ferocious
determination
.
But
something
*NL*
lacked
.
Perhaps
it
was
from
excess
.
Perhaps
the
jaw
was
too
large
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
,
it
was
a
lie
.
Beauty
Smith
was
known
far
and
wide
as
the
*NL*
weakest
of
weak-kneed
and
snivelling
cowards
.
To
complete
his
*NL*
description
,
his
teeth
were
large
and
yellow
,
while
the
two
eye-teeth
,
*NL*
larger
than
their
fellows
,
showed
under
his
lean
lips
like
fangs
.
His
*NL*
eyes
were
yellow
and
muddy
,
as
though
Nature
had
run
short
on
pigments
*NL*
and
squeezed
together
the
dregs
of
all
her
tubes
.
It
was
the
same
with
*NL*
his
hair
,
sparse
and
irregular
of
growth
,
muddy-yellow
and
dirty-yellow
,
*NL*
rising
on
his
head
and
sprouting
out
of
his
face
in
unexpected
tufts
and
*NL*
bunches
,
in
appearance
like
clumped
and
wind-blown
grain
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
Beauty
Smith
was
a
monstrosity
,
and
the
blame
of
it
lay
*NL*
elsewhere
.
He
was
not
responsible
.
The
clay
of
him
had
been
so
moulded
*NL*
in
the
making
.
He
did
the
cooking
for
the
other
men
in
the
fort
,
the
*NL*
dish-washing
and
the
drudgery
.
They
did
not
despise
him
.
Rather
did
*NL*
they
tolerate
him
in
a
broad
human
way
,
as
one
tolerates
any
creature
*NL*
evilly
treated
in
the
making
.
Also
,
they
feared
him
.
His
cowardly
rages
*NL*
made
them
dread
a
shot
in
the
back
or
poison
in
their
coffee
.
But
*NL*
somebody
had
to
do
the
cooking
,
and
whatever
else
his
shortcomings
,
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
could
cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
man
that
looked
at
White
Fang
,
delighted
in
his
ferocious
*NL*
prowess
,
and
desired
to
possess
him
.
He
made
overtures
to
White
Fang
*NL*
from
the
first
.
White
Fang
began
by
ignoring
him
.
Later
on
,
when
the
*NL*
overtures
became
more
insistent
,
White
Fang
bristled
and
bared
his
teeth
*NL*
and
backed
away
.
He
did
not
like
the
man
.
The
feel
of
him
was
bad
.
He
*NL*
sensed
the
evil
in
him
,
and
feared
the
extended
hand
and
the
attempts
at
*NL*
soft-spoken
speech
.
Because
of
all
this
,
he
hated
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
simpler
creatures
,
good
and
bad
are
things
simply
understood
.
*NL*
The
good
stands
for
all
things
that
bring
easement
and
satisfaction
and
*NL*
surcease
from
pain
.
Therefore
,
the
good
is
liked
.
The
bad
stands
for
*NL*
all
things
that
are
fraught
with
discomfort
,
menace
,
and
hurt
,
and
is
*NL*
hated
accordingly
.
White
Fang
's
feel
of
Beauty
Smith
was
bad
.
From
the
*NL*
man
's
distorted
body
and
twisted
mind
,
in
occult
ways
,
like
mists
rising
*NL*
from
malarial
marshes
,
came
emanations
of
the
unhealth
within
.
Not
by
*NL*
reasoning
,
not
by
the
five
senses
alone
,
but
by
other
and
remoter
and
*NL*
uncharted
senses
,
came
the
feeling
to
White
Fang
that
the
man
was
ominous
*NL*
with
evil
,
pregnant
with
hurtfulness
,
and
therefore
a
thing
bad
,
and
*NL*
wisely
to
be
hated
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
was
in
Grey
Beaver
's
camp
when
Beauty
Smith
first
visited
it
.
*NL*
At
the
faint
sound
of
his
distant
feet
,
before
he
came
in
sight
,
White
*NL*
Fang
knew
who
was
coming
and
began
to
bristle
.
He
had
been
lying
down
in
*NL*
an
abandon
of
comfort
,
but
he
arose
quickly
,
and
,
as
the
man
arrived
,
*NL*
slid
away
in
true
wolf-fashion
to
the
edge
of
the
camp
.
He
did
not
know
*NL*
what
they
said
,
but
he
could
see
the
man
and
Grey
Beaver
talking
*NL*
together
.
Once
,
the
man
pointed
at
him
,
and
White
Fang
snarled
back
as
*NL*
though
the
hand
were
just
descending
upon
him
instead
of
being
,
as
it
*NL*
was
,
fifty
feet
away
.
The
man
laughed
at
this
;
and
White
Fang
slunk
away
*NL*
to
the
sheltering
woods
,
his
head
turned
to
observe
as
he
glided
softly
*NL*
over
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
refused
to
sell
the
dog
.
He
had
grown
rich
with
his
trading
*NL*
and
stood
in
need
of
nothing
.
Besides
,
White
Fang
was
a
valuable
animal
,
*NL*
the
strongest
sled-dog
he
had
ever
owned
,
and
the
best
leader
.
*NL*
Furthermore
,
there
was
no
dog
like
him
on
the
Mackenzie
nor
the
Yukon
.
He
*NL*
could
fight
.
He
killed
other
dogs
as
easily
as
men
killed
mosquitoes
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Beauty
Smith
's
eyes
lighted
up
at
this
,
and
he
licked
his
thin
lips
with
*NL*
an
eager
tongue
-RRB-
.
No
,
White
Fang
was
not
for
sale
at
any
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Beauty
Smith
knew
the
ways
of
Indians
.
He
visited
Grey
Beaver
's
camp
*NL*
often
,
and
hidden
under
his
coat
was
always
a
black
bottle
or
so
.
One
of
*NL*
the
potencies
of
whisky
is
the
breeding
of
thirst
.
Grey
Beaver
got
the
*NL*
thirst
.
His
fevered
membranes
and
burnt
stomach
began
to
clamour
for
*NL*
more
and
more
of
the
scorching
fluid
;
while
his
brain
,
thrust
all
awry
by
*NL*
the
unwonted
stimulant
,
permitted
him
to
go
any
length
to
obtain
it
.
The
*NL*
money
he
had
received
for
his
furs
and
mittens
and
moccasins
began
to
go
.
*NL*
It
went
faster
and
faster
,
and
the
shorter
his
money-sack
grew
,
the
*NL*
shorter
grew
his
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
end
his
money
and
goods
and
temper
were
all
gone
.
Nothing
*NL*
remained
to
him
but
his
thirst
,
a
prodigious
possession
in
itself
that
*NL*
grew
more
prodigious
with
every
sober
breath
he
drew
.
Then
it
was
that
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
had
talk
with
him
again
about
the
sale
of
White
Fang
;
but
*NL*
this
time
the
price
offered
was
in
bottles
,
not
dollars
,
and
Grey
*NL*
Beaver
's
ears
were
more
eager
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ketch
um
dog
you
take
um
all
right
,
''
was
his
last
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bottles
were
delivered
,
but
after
two
days
.
``
You
ketch
um
dog
,
''
were
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
's
words
to
Grey
Beaver
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
slunk
into
camp
one
evening
and
dropped
down
with
a
sigh
of
*NL*
content
.
The
dreaded
white
god
was
not
there
.
For
days
his
*NL*
manifestations
of
desire
to
lay
hands
on
him
had
been
growing
more
*NL*
insistent
,
and
during
that
time
White
Fang
had
been
compelled
to
avoid
*NL*
the
camp
.
He
did
not
know
what
evil
was
threatened
by
those
insistent
*NL*
hands
.
He
knew
only
that
they
did
threaten
evil
of
some
sort
,
and
that
*NL*
it
was
best
for
him
to
keep
out
of
their
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
scarcely
had
he
lain
down
when
Grey
Beaver
staggered
over
to
him
and
*NL*
tied
a
leather
thong
around
his
neck
.
He
sat
down
beside
White
Fang
,
*NL*
holding
the
end
of
the
thong
in
his
hand
.
In
the
other
hand
he
held
a
*NL*
bottle
,
which
,
from
time
to
time
,
was
inverted
above
his
head
to
the
*NL*
accompaniment
of
gurgling
noises
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
of
this
passed
,
when
the
vibrations
of
feet
in
contact
with
the
*NL*
ground
foreran
the
one
who
approached
.
White
Fang
heard
it
first
,
and
he
*NL*
was
bristling
with
recognition
while
Grey
Beaver
still
nodded
stupidly
.
*NL*
White
Fang
tried
to
draw
the
thong
softly
out
of
his
master
's
hand
;
but
*NL*
the
relaxed
fingers
closed
tightly
and
Grey
Beaver
roused
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
strode
into
camp
and
stood
over
White
Fang
.
He
snarled
*NL*
softly
up
at
the
thing
of
fear
,
watching
keenly
the
deportment
of
the
*NL*
hands
.
One
hand
extended
outward
and
began
to
descend
upon
his
head
.
His
*NL*
soft
snarl
grew
tense
and
harsh
.
The
hand
continued
slowly
to
descend
,
*NL*
while
he
crouched
beneath
it
,
eyeing
it
malignantly
,
his
snarl
growing
*NL*
shorter
and
shorter
as
,
with
quickening
breath
,
it
approached
its
*NL*
culmination
.
Suddenly
he
snapped
,
striking
with
his
fangs
like
a
snake
.
*NL*
The
hand
was
jerked
back
,
and
the
teeth
came
together
emptily
with
a
*NL*
sharp
click
.
Beauty
Smith
was
frightened
and
angry
.
Grey
Beaver
clouted
*NL*
White
Fang
alongside
the
head
,
so
that
he
cowered
down
close
to
the
earth
*NL*
in
respectful
obedience
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
's
suspicious
eyes
followed
every
movement
.
He
saw
Beauty
*NL*
Smith
go
away
and
return
with
a
stout
club
.
Then
the
end
of
the
thong
*NL*
was
given
over
to
him
by
Grey
Beaver
.
Beauty
Smith
started
to
walk
away
.
*NL*
The
thong
grew
taut
.
White
Fang
resisted
it
.
Grey
Beaver
clouted
him
*NL*
right
and
left
to
make
him
get
up
and
follow
.
He
obeyed
,
but
with
a
*NL*
rush
,
hurling
himself
upon
the
stranger
who
was
dragging
him
away
.
Beauty
*NL*
Smith
did
not
jump
away
.
He
had
been
waiting
for
this
.
He
swung
the
*NL*
club
smartly
,
stopping
the
rush
midway
and
smashing
White
Fang
down
upon
*NL*
the
ground
.
Grey
Beaver
laughed
and
nodded
approval
.
Beauty
Smith
*NL*
tightened
the
thong
again
,
and
White
Fang
crawled
limply
and
dizzily
to
*NL*
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
rush
a
second
time
.
One
smash
from
the
club
was
sufficient
to
*NL*
convince
him
that
the
white
god
knew
how
to
handle
it
,
and
he
was
too
*NL*
wise
to
fight
the
inevitable
.
So
he
followed
morosely
at
Beauty
Smith
's
*NL*
heels
,
his
tail
between
his
legs
,
yet
snarling
softly
under
his
breath
.
*NL*
But
Beauty
Smith
kept
a
wary
eye
on
him
,
and
the
club
was
held
always
*NL*
ready
to
strike
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
fort
Beauty
Smith
left
him
securely
tied
and
went
in
to
bed
.
White
*NL*
Fang
waited
an
hour
.
Then
he
applied
his
teeth
to
the
thong
,
and
in
the
*NL*
space
of
ten
seconds
was
free
.
He
had
wasted
no
time
with
his
teeth
.
*NL*
There
had
been
no
useless
gnawing
.
The
thong
was
cut
across
,
diagonally
,
*NL*
almost
as
clean
as
though
done
by
a
knife
.
White
Fang
looked
up
at
the
*NL*
fort
,
at
the
same
time
bristling
and
growling
.
Then
he
turned
and
*NL*
trotted
back
to
Grey
Beaver
's
camp
.
He
owed
no
allegiance
to
this
*NL*
strange
and
terrible
god
.
He
had
given
himself
to
Grey
Beaver
,
and
to
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
he
considered
he
still
belonged
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
had
occurred
before
was
repeated
--
with
a
difference
.
Grey
*NL*
Beaver
again
made
him
fast
with
a
thong
,
and
in
the
morning
turned
him
*NL*
over
to
Beauty
Smith
.
And
here
was
where
the
difference
came
in
.
Beauty
*NL*
Smith
gave
him
a
beating
.
Tied
securely
,
White
Fang
could
only
rage
*NL*
futilely
and
endure
the
punishment
.
Club
and
whip
were
both
used
upon
*NL*
him
,
and
he
experienced
the
worst
beating
he
had
ever
received
in
his
*NL*
life
.
Even
the
big
beating
given
him
in
his
puppyhood
by
Grey
Beaver
was
*NL*
mild
compared
with
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
enjoyed
the
task
.
He
delighted
in
it
.
He
gloated
over
his
*NL*
victim
,
and
his
eyes
flamed
dully
,
as
he
swung
the
whip
or
club
and
*NL*
listened
to
White
Fang
's
cries
of
pain
and
to
his
helpless
bellows
and
*NL*
snarls
.
For
Beauty
Smith
was
cruel
in
the
way
that
cowards
are
cruel
.
*NL*
Cringing
and
snivelling
himself
before
the
blows
or
angry
speech
of
a
*NL*
man
,
he
revenged
himself
,
in
turn
,
upon
creatures
weaker
than
he
.
All
*NL*
life
likes
power
,
and
Beauty
Smith
was
no
exception
.
Denied
the
*NL*
expression
of
power
amongst
his
own
kind
,
he
fell
back
upon
the
lesser
*NL*
creatures
and
there
vindicated
the
life
that
was
in
him
.
But
Beauty
*NL*
Smith
had
not
created
himself
,
and
no
blame
was
to
be
attached
to
him
.
He
*NL*
had
come
into
the
world
with
a
twisted
body
and
a
brute
intelligence
.
*NL*
This
had
constituted
the
clay
of
him
,
and
it
had
not
been
kindly
moulded
*NL*
by
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
knew
why
he
was
being
beaten
.
When
Grey
Beaver
tied
the
thong
*NL*
around
his
neck
,
and
passed
the
end
of
the
thong
into
Beauty
Smith
's
*NL*
keeping
,
White
Fang
knew
that
it
was
his
god
's
will
for
him
to
go
with
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
.
And
when
Beauty
Smith
left
him
tied
outside
the
fort
,
he
*NL*
knew
that
it
was
Beauty
Smith
's
will
that
he
should
remain
there
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
he
had
disobeyed
the
will
of
both
the
gods
,
and
earned
the
*NL*
consequent
punishment
.
He
had
seen
dogs
change
owners
in
the
past
,
and
*NL*
he
had
seen
the
runaways
beaten
as
he
was
being
beaten
.
He
was
wise
,
and
*NL*
yet
in
the
nature
of
him
there
were
forces
greater
than
wisdom
.
One
of
*NL*
these
was
fidelity
.
He
did
not
love
Grey
Beaver
,
yet
,
even
in
the
face
*NL*
of
his
will
and
his
anger
,
he
was
faithful
to
him
.
He
could
not
help
it
.
*NL*
This
faithfulness
was
a
quality
of
the
clay
that
composed
him
.
It
was
*NL*
the
quality
that
was
peculiarly
the
possession
of
his
kind
;
the
quality
*NL*
that
set
apart
his
species
from
all
other
species
;
the
quality
that
has
*NL*
enabled
the
wolf
and
the
wild
dog
to
come
in
from
the
open
and
be
the
*NL*
companions
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
beating
,
White
Fang
was
dragged
back
to
the
fort
.
But
this
*NL*
time
Beauty
Smith
left
him
tied
with
a
stick
.
One
does
not
give
up
a
god
*NL*
easily
,
and
so
with
White
Fang
.
Grey
Beaver
was
his
own
particular
god
,
*NL*
and
,
in
spite
of
Grey
Beaver
's
will
,
White
Fang
still
clung
to
him
and
*NL*
would
not
give
him
up
.
Grey
Beaver
had
betrayed
and
forsaken
him
,
but
*NL*
that
had
no
effect
upon
him
.
Not
for
nothing
had
he
surrendered
himself
*NL*
body
and
soul
to
Grey
Beaver
.
There
had
been
no
reservation
on
White
*NL*
Fang
's
part
,
and
the
bond
was
not
to
be
broken
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
in
the
night
,
when
the
men
in
the
fort
were
asleep
,
White
Fang
*NL*
applied
his
teeth
to
the
stick
that
held
him
.
The
wood
was
seasoned
and
*NL*
dry
,
and
it
was
tied
so
closely
to
his
neck
that
he
could
scarcely
get
*NL*
his
teeth
to
it
.
It
was
only
by
the
severest
muscular
exertion
and
neck
-
*NL*
arching
that
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
wood
between
his
teeth
,
and
*NL*
barely
between
his
teeth
at
that
;
and
it
was
only
by
the
exercise
of
an
*NL*
immense
patience
,
extending
through
many
hours
,
that
he
succeeded
in
*NL*
gnawing
through
the
stick
.
This
was
something
that
dogs
were
not
*NL*
supposed
to
do
.
It
was
unprecedented
.
But
White
Fang
did
it
,
trotting
*NL*
away
from
the
fort
in
the
early
morning
,
with
the
end
of
the
stick
*NL*
hanging
to
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
wise
.
But
had
he
been
merely
wise
he
would
not
have
gone
back
to
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
who
had
already
twice
betrayed
him
.
But
there
was
his
*NL*
faithfulness
,
and
he
went
back
to
be
betrayed
yet
a
third
time
.
Again
he
*NL*
yielded
to
the
tying
of
a
thong
around
his
neck
by
Grey
Beaver
,
and
again
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
came
to
claim
him
.
And
this
time
he
was
beaten
even
more
*NL*
severely
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grey
Beaver
looked
on
stolidly
while
the
white
man
wielded
the
whip
.
He
*NL*
gave
no
protection
.
It
was
no
longer
his
dog
.
When
the
beating
was
over
*NL*
White
Fang
was
sick
.
A
soft
southland
dog
would
have
died
under
it
,
but
*NL*
not
he
.
His
school
of
life
had
been
sterner
,
and
he
was
himself
of
*NL*
sterner
stuff
.
He
had
too
great
vitality
.
His
clutch
on
life
was
too
*NL*
strong
.
But
he
was
very
sick
.
At
first
he
was
unable
to
drag
himself
*NL*
along
,
and
Beauty
Smith
had
to
wait
half-an-hour
for
him
.
And
then
,
*NL*
blind
and
reeling
,
he
followed
at
Beauty
Smith
's
heels
back
to
the
fort
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
he
was
tied
with
a
chain
that
defied
his
teeth
,
and
he
strove
in
*NL*
vain
,
by
lunging
,
to
draw
the
staple
from
the
timber
into
which
it
was
*NL*
driven
.
After
a
few
days
,
sober
and
bankrupt
,
Grey
Beaver
departed
up
*NL*
the
Porcupine
on
his
long
journey
to
the
Mackenzie
.
White
Fang
remained
*NL*
on
the
Yukon
,
the
property
of
a
man
more
than
half
mad
and
all
brute
.
But
*NL*
what
is
a
dog
to
know
in
its
consciousness
of
madness
?
To
White
Fang
,
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
was
a
veritable
,
if
terrible
,
god
.
He
was
a
mad
god
at
*NL*
best
,
but
White
Fang
knew
nothing
of
madness
;
he
knew
only
that
he
must
*NL*
submit
to
the
will
of
this
new
master
,
obey
his
every
whim
and
fancy
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
REIGN
OF
HATE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
tutelage
of
the
mad
god
,
White
Fang
became
a
fiend
.
He
was
*NL*
kept
chained
in
a
pen
at
the
rear
of
the
fort
,
and
here
Beauty
Smith
*NL*
teased
and
irritated
and
drove
him
wild
with
petty
torments
.
The
man
*NL*
early
discovered
White
Fang
's
susceptibility
to
laughter
,
and
made
it
a
*NL*
point
after
painfully
tricking
him
,
to
laugh
at
him
.
This
laughter
was
*NL*
uproarious
and
scornful
,
and
at
the
same
time
the
god
pointed
his
finger
*NL*
derisively
at
White
Fang
.
At
such
times
reason
fled
from
White
Fang
,
and
*NL*
in
his
transports
of
rage
he
was
even
more
mad
than
Beauty
Smith
.
*NL*
*NL*
Formerly
,
White
Fang
had
been
merely
the
enemy
of
his
kind
,
withal
a
*NL*
ferocious
enemy
.
He
now
became
the
enemy
of
all
things
,
and
more
*NL*
ferocious
than
ever
.
To
such
an
extent
was
he
tormented
,
that
he
hated
*NL*
blindly
and
without
the
faintest
spark
of
reason
.
He
hated
the
chain
*NL*
that
bound
him
,
the
men
who
peered
in
at
him
through
the
slats
of
the
*NL*
pen
,
the
dogs
that
accompanied
the
men
and
that
snarled
malignantly
at
*NL*
him
in
his
helplessness
.
He
hated
the
very
wood
of
the
pen
that
confined
*NL*
him
.
And
,
first
,
last
,
and
most
of
all
,
he
hated
Beauty
Smith
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Beauty
Smith
had
a
purpose
in
all
that
he
did
to
White
Fang
.
One
day
*NL*
a
number
of
men
gathered
about
the
pen
.
Beauty
Smith
entered
,
club
in
*NL*
hand
,
and
took
the
chain
off
from
White
Fang
's
neck
.
When
his
master
had
*NL*
gone
out
,
White
Fang
turned
loose
and
tore
around
the
pen
,
trying
to
get
*NL*
at
the
men
outside
.
He
was
magnificently
terrible
.
Fully
five
feet
in
*NL*
length
,
and
standing
two
and
one-half
feet
at
the
shoulder
,
he
far
*NL*
outweighed
a
wolf
of
corresponding
size
.
From
his
mother
he
had
*NL*
inherited
the
heavier
proportions
of
the
dog
,
so
that
he
weighed
,
without
*NL*
any
fat
and
without
an
ounce
of
superfluous
flesh
,
over
ninety
pounds
.
It
*NL*
was
all
muscle
,
bone
,
and
sinew-fighting
flesh
in
the
finest
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
pen
was
being
opened
again
.
White
Fang
paused
.
Something
*NL*
unusual
was
happening
.
He
waited
.
The
door
was
opened
wider
.
Then
a
*NL*
huge
dog
was
thrust
inside
,
and
the
door
was
slammed
shut
behind
him
.
*NL*
White
Fang
had
never
seen
such
a
dog
-LRB-
it
was
a
mastiff
-RRB-
;
but
the
size
and
*NL*
fierce
aspect
of
the
intruder
did
not
deter
him
.
Here
was
some
thing
,
*NL*
not
wood
nor
iron
,
upon
which
to
wreak
his
hate
.
He
leaped
in
with
a
*NL*
flash
of
fangs
that
ripped
down
the
side
of
the
mastiff
's
neck
.
The
*NL*
mastiff
shook
his
head
,
growled
hoarsely
,
and
plunged
at
White
Fang
.
But
*NL*
White
Fang
was
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
,
always
evading
and
eluding
,
*NL*
and
always
leaping
in
and
slashing
with
his
fangs
and
leaping
out
again
*NL*
in
time
to
escape
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
outside
shouted
and
applauded
,
while
Beauty
Smith
,
in
an
ecstasy
*NL*
of
delight
,
gloated
over
the
ripping
and
mangling
performed
by
White
*NL*
Fang
.
There
was
no
hope
for
the
mastiff
from
the
first
.
He
was
too
*NL*
ponderous
and
slow
.
In
the
end
,
while
Beauty
Smith
beat
White
Fang
back
*NL*
with
a
club
,
the
mastiff
was
dragged
out
by
its
owner
.
Then
there
was
a
*NL*
payment
of
bets
,
and
money
clinked
in
Beauty
Smith
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
came
to
look
forward
eagerly
to
the
gathering
of
the
men
*NL*
around
his
pen
.
It
meant
a
fight
;
and
this
was
the
only
way
that
was
now
*NL*
vouchsafed
him
of
expressing
the
life
that
was
in
him
.
Tormented
,
*NL*
incited
to
hate
,
he
was
kept
a
prisoner
so
that
there
was
no
way
of
*NL*
satisfying
that
hate
except
at
the
times
his
master
saw
fit
to
put
*NL*
another
dog
against
him
.
Beauty
Smith
had
estimated
his
powers
well
,
for
*NL*
he
was
invariably
the
victor
.
One
day
,
three
dogs
were
turned
in
upon
*NL*
him
in
succession
.
Another
day
a
full-grown
wolf
,
fresh-caught
from
the
*NL*
Wild
,
was
shoved
in
through
the
door
of
the
pen
.
And
on
still
another
*NL*
day
two
dogs
were
set
against
him
at
the
same
time
.
This
was
his
*NL*
severest
fight
,
and
though
in
the
end
he
killed
them
both
he
was
himself
*NL*
half
killed
in
doing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fall
of
the
year
,
when
the
first
snows
were
falling
and
mush-ice
*NL*
was
running
in
the
river
,
Beauty
Smith
took
passage
for
himself
and
White
*NL*
Fang
on
a
steamboat
bound
up
the
Yukon
to
Dawson
.
White
Fang
had
now
*NL*
achieved
a
reputation
in
the
land
.
As
``
the
Fighting
Wolf
''
he
was
known
*NL*
far
and
wide
,
and
the
cage
in
which
he
was
kept
on
the
steam-boat
's
deck
*NL*
was
usually
surrounded
by
curious
men
.
He
raged
and
snarled
at
them
,
or
*NL*
lay
quietly
and
studied
them
with
cold
hatred
.
Why
should
he
not
hate
*NL*
them
?
He
never
asked
himself
the
question
.
He
knew
only
hate
and
lost
*NL*
himself
in
the
passion
of
it
.
Life
had
become
a
hell
to
him
.
He
had
not
*NL*
been
made
for
the
close
confinement
wild
beasts
endure
at
the
hands
of
*NL*
men
.
And
yet
it
was
in
precisely
this
way
that
he
was
treated
.
Men
*NL*
stared
at
him
,
poked
sticks
between
the
bars
to
make
him
snarl
,
and
then
*NL*
laughed
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
his
environment
,
these
men
,
and
they
were
moulding
the
clay
of
*NL*
him
into
a
more
ferocious
thing
than
had
been
intended
by
Nature
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Nature
had
given
him
plasticity
.
Where
many
another
animal
*NL*
would
have
died
or
had
its
spirit
broken
,
he
adjusted
himself
and
lived
,
*NL*
and
at
no
expense
of
the
spirit
.
Possibly
Beauty
Smith
,
arch-fiend
and
*NL*
tormentor
,
was
capable
of
breaking
White
Fang
's
spirit
,
but
as
yet
there
*NL*
were
no
signs
of
his
succeeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Beauty
Smith
had
in
him
a
devil
,
White
Fang
had
another
;
and
the
two
*NL*
of
them
raged
against
each
other
unceasingly
.
In
the
days
before
,
White
*NL*
Fang
had
had
the
wisdom
to
cower
down
and
submit
to
a
man
with
a
club
in
*NL*
his
hand
;
but
this
wisdom
now
left
him
.
The
mere
sight
of
Beauty
Smith
*NL*
was
sufficient
to
send
him
into
transports
of
fury
.
And
when
they
came
*NL*
to
close
quarters
,
and
he
had
been
beaten
back
by
the
club
,
he
went
on
*NL*
growling
and
snarling
,
and
showing
his
fangs
.
The
last
growl
could
never
*NL*
be
extracted
from
him
.
No
matter
how
terribly
he
was
beaten
,
he
had
*NL*
always
another
growl
;
and
when
Beauty
Smith
gave
up
and
withdrew
,
the
*NL*
defiant
growl
followed
after
him
,
or
White
Fang
sprang
at
the
bars
of
the
*NL*
cage
bellowing
his
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
steamboat
arrived
at
Dawson
,
White
Fang
went
ashore
.
But
he
*NL*
still
lived
a
public
life
,
in
a
cage
,
surrounded
by
curious
men
.
He
was
*NL*
exhibited
as
``
the
Fighting
Wolf
,
''
and
men
paid
fifty
cents
in
gold
dust
*NL*
to
see
him
.
He
was
given
no
rest
.
Did
he
lie
down
to
sleep
,
he
was
*NL*
stirred
up
by
a
sharp
stick
--
so
that
the
audience
might
get
its
money
's
*NL*
worth
.
In
order
to
make
the
exhibition
interesting
,
he
was
kept
in
a
*NL*
rage
most
of
the
time
.
But
worse
than
all
this
,
was
the
atmosphere
in
*NL*
which
he
lived
.
He
was
regarded
as
the
most
fearful
of
wild
beasts
,
and
*NL*
this
was
borne
in
to
him
through
the
bars
of
the
cage
.
Every
word
,
every
*NL*
cautious
action
,
on
the
part
of
the
men
,
impressed
upon
him
his
own
*NL*
terrible
ferocity
.
It
was
so
much
added
fuel
to
the
flame
of
his
*NL*
fierceness
.
There
could
be
but
one
result
,
and
that
was
that
his
*NL*
ferocity
fed
upon
itself
and
increased
.
It
was
another
instance
of
the
*NL*
plasticity
of
his
clay
,
of
his
capacity
for
being
moulded
by
the
pressure
*NL*
of
environment
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
being
exhibited
he
was
a
professional
fighting
animal
.
At
*NL*
irregular
intervals
,
whenever
a
fight
could
be
arranged
,
he
was
taken
out
*NL*
of
his
cage
and
led
off
into
the
woods
a
few
miles
from
town
.
Usually
*NL*
this
occurred
at
night
,
so
as
to
avoid
interference
from
the
mounted
*NL*
police
of
the
Territory
.
After
a
few
hours
of
waiting
,
when
daylight
had
*NL*
come
,
the
audience
and
the
dog
with
which
he
was
to
fight
arrived
.
In
*NL*
this
manner
it
came
about
that
he
fought
all
sizes
and
breeds
of
dogs
.
It
*NL*
was
a
savage
land
,
the
men
were
savage
,
and
the
fights
were
usually
to
*NL*
the
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
White
Fang
continued
to
fight
,
it
is
obvious
that
it
was
the
other
*NL*
dogs
that
died
.
He
never
knew
defeat
.
His
early
training
,
when
he
*NL*
fought
with
Lip-lip
and
the
whole
puppy-pack
,
stood
him
in
good
stead
.
*NL*
There
was
the
tenacity
with
which
he
clung
to
the
earth
.
No
dog
could
*NL*
make
him
lose
his
footing
.
This
was
the
favourite
trick
of
the
wolf
*NL*
breeds
--
to
rush
in
upon
him
,
either
directly
or
with
an
unexpected
*NL*
swerve
,
in
the
hope
of
striking
his
shoulder
and
overthrowing
him
.
*NL*
Mackenzie
hounds
,
Eskimo
and
Labrador
dogs
,
huskies
and
Malemutes
--
all
*NL*
tried
it
on
him
,
and
all
failed
.
He
was
never
known
to
lose
his
footing
.
*NL*
Men
told
this
to
one
another
,
and
looked
each
time
to
see
it
happen
;
but
*NL*
White
Fang
always
disappointed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
his
lightning
quickness
.
It
gave
him
a
tremendous
*NL*
advantage
over
his
antagonists
.
No
matter
what
their
fighting
*NL*
experience
,
they
had
never
encountered
a
dog
that
moved
so
swiftly
as
he
.
*NL*
Also
to
be
reckoned
with
,
was
the
immediateness
of
his
attack
.
The
*NL*
average
dog
was
accustomed
to
the
preliminaries
of
snarling
and
bristling
*NL*
and
growling
,
and
the
average
dog
was
knocked
off
his
feet
and
finished
*NL*
before
he
had
begun
to
fight
or
recovered
from
his
surprise
.
So
often
*NL*
did
this
happen
,
that
it
became
the
custom
to
hold
White
Fang
until
the
*NL*
other
dog
went
through
its
preliminaries
,
was
good
and
ready
,
and
even
*NL*
made
the
first
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
greatest
of
all
the
advantages
in
White
Fang
's
favour
,
was
his
*NL*
experience
.
He
knew
more
about
fighting
than
did
any
of
the
dogs
that
*NL*
faced
him
.
He
had
fought
more
fights
,
knew
how
to
meet
more
tricks
and
*NL*
methods
,
and
had
more
tricks
himself
,
while
his
own
method
was
scarcely
*NL*
to
be
improved
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
time
went
by
,
he
had
fewer
and
fewer
fights
.
Men
despaired
of
*NL*
matching
him
with
an
equal
,
and
Beauty
Smith
was
compelled
to
pit
wolves
*NL*
against
him
.
These
were
trapped
by
the
Indians
for
the
purpose
,
and
a
*NL*
fight
between
White
Fang
and
a
wolf
was
always
sure
to
draw
a
crowd
.
*NL*
Once
,
a
full-grown
female
lynx
was
secured
,
and
this
time
White
Fang
*NL*
fought
for
his
life
.
Her
quickness
matched
his
;
her
ferocity
equalled
*NL*
his
;
while
he
fought
with
his
fangs
alone
,
and
she
fought
with
her
sharp
-
*NL*
clawed
feet
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
the
lynx
,
all
fighting
ceased
for
White
Fang
.
There
were
no
*NL*
more
animals
with
which
to
fight
--
at
least
,
there
was
none
considered
*NL*
worthy
of
fighting
with
him
.
So
he
remained
on
exhibition
until
spring
,
*NL*
when
one
Tim
Keenan
,
a
faro-dealer
,
arrived
in
the
land
.
With
him
came
*NL*
the
first
bull-dog
that
had
ever
entered
the
Klondike
.
That
this
dog
and
*NL*
White
Fang
should
come
together
was
inevitable
,
and
for
a
week
the
*NL*
anticipated
fight
was
the
mainspring
of
conversation
in
certain
quarters
*NL*
of
the
town
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
CLINGING
DEATH
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
slipped
the
chain
from
his
neck
and
stepped
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
once
White
Fang
did
not
make
an
immediate
attack
.
He
stood
still
,
*NL*
ears
pricked
forward
,
alert
and
curious
,
surveying
the
strange
animal
*NL*
that
faced
him
.
He
had
never
seen
such
a
dog
before
.
Tim
Keenan
shoved
*NL*
the
bull-dog
forward
with
a
muttered
``
Go
to
it
.
''
The
animal
waddled
*NL*
toward
the
centre
of
the
circle
,
short
and
squat
and
ungainly
.
He
came
*NL*
to
a
stop
and
blinked
across
at
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
cries
from
the
crowd
of
,
``
Go
to
him
,
Cherokee
!
Sick
'm
,
*NL*
Cherokee
!
Eat
'm
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Cherokee
did
not
seem
anxious
to
fight
.
He
turned
his
head
and
*NL*
blinked
at
the
men
who
shouted
,
at
the
same
time
wagging
his
stump
of
a
*NL*
tail
good-naturedly
.
He
was
not
afraid
,
but
merely
lazy
.
Besides
,
it
*NL*
did
not
seem
to
him
that
it
was
intended
he
should
fight
with
the
dog
he
*NL*
saw
before
him
.
He
was
not
used
to
fighting
with
that
kind
of
dog
,
and
*NL*
he
was
waiting
for
them
to
bring
on
the
real
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tim
Keenan
stepped
in
and
bent
over
Cherokee
,
fondling
him
on
both
sides
*NL*
of
the
shoulders
with
hands
that
rubbed
against
the
grain
of
the
hair
and
*NL*
that
made
slight
,
pushing-forward
movements
.
These
were
so
many
*NL*
suggestions
.
Also
,
their
effect
was
irritating
,
for
Cherokee
began
to
*NL*
growl
,
very
softly
,
deep
down
in
his
throat
.
There
was
a
correspondence
*NL*
in
rhythm
between
the
growls
and
the
movements
of
the
man
's
hands
.
The
*NL*
growl
rose
in
the
throat
with
the
culmination
of
each
forward-pushing
*NL*
movement
,
and
ebbed
down
to
start
up
afresh
with
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
next
movement
.
The
end
of
each
movement
was
the
accent
of
the
rhythm
,
*NL*
the
movement
ending
abruptly
and
the
growling
rising
with
a
jerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
without
its
effect
on
White
Fang
.
The
hair
began
to
rise
on
*NL*
his
neck
and
across
the
shoulders
.
Tim
Keenan
gave
a
final
shove
forward
*NL*
and
stepped
back
again
.
As
the
impetus
that
carried
Cherokee
forward
*NL*
died
down
,
he
continued
to
go
forward
of
his
own
volition
,
in
a
swift
,
*NL*
bow-legged
run
.
Then
White
Fang
struck
.
A
cry
of
startled
admiration
*NL*
went
up
.
He
had
covered
the
distance
and
gone
in
more
like
a
cat
than
a
*NL*
dog
;
and
with
the
same
cat-like
swiftness
he
had
slashed
with
his
fangs
*NL*
and
leaped
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bull-dog
was
bleeding
back
of
one
ear
from
a
rip
in
his
thick
neck
.
*NL*
He
gave
no
sign
,
did
not
even
snarl
,
but
turned
and
followed
after
White
*NL*
Fang
.
The
display
on
both
sides
,
the
quickness
of
the
one
and
the
*NL*
steadiness
of
the
other
,
had
excited
the
partisan
spirit
of
the
crowd
,
*NL*
and
the
men
were
making
new
bets
and
increasing
original
bets
.
Again
,
*NL*
and
yet
again
,
White
Fang
sprang
in
,
slashed
,
and
got
away
untouched
,
and
*NL*
still
his
strange
foe
followed
after
him
,
without
too
great
haste
,
not
*NL*
slowly
,
but
deliberately
and
determinedly
,
in
a
businesslike
sort
of
way
.
*NL*
There
was
purpose
in
his
method
--
something
for
him
to
do
that
he
was
*NL*
intent
upon
doing
and
from
which
nothing
could
distract
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
whole
demeanour
,
every
action
,
was
stamped
with
this
purpose
.
It
*NL*
puzzled
White
Fang
.
Never
had
he
seen
such
a
dog
.
It
had
no
hair
*NL*
protection
.
It
was
soft
,
and
bled
easily
.
There
was
no
thick
mat
of
fur
*NL*
to
baffle
White
Fang
's
teeth
as
they
were
often
baffled
by
dogs
of
his
*NL*
own
breed
.
Each
time
that
his
teeth
struck
they
sank
easily
into
the
*NL*
yielding
flesh
,
while
the
animal
did
not
seem
able
to
defend
itself
.
*NL*
Another
disconcerting
thing
was
that
it
made
no
outcry
,
such
as
he
had
*NL*
been
accustomed
to
with
the
other
dogs
he
had
fought
.
Beyond
a
growl
or
*NL*
a
grunt
,
the
dog
took
its
punishment
silently
.
And
never
did
it
flag
in
*NL*
its
pursuit
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
Cherokee
was
slow
.
He
could
turn
and
whirl
swiftly
enough
,
but
*NL*
White
Fang
was
never
there
.
Cherokee
was
puzzled
,
too
.
He
had
never
*NL*
fought
before
with
a
dog
with
which
he
could
not
close
.
The
desire
to
*NL*
close
had
always
been
mutual
.
But
here
was
a
dog
that
kept
at
a
*NL*
distance
,
dancing
and
dodging
here
and
there
and
all
about
.
And
when
it
*NL*
did
get
its
teeth
into
him
,
it
did
not
hold
on
but
let
go
instantly
and
*NL*
darted
away
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
White
Fang
could
not
get
at
the
soft
underside
of
the
throat
.
The
*NL*
bull-dog
stood
too
short
,
while
its
massive
jaws
were
an
added
*NL*
protection
.
White
Fang
darted
in
and
out
unscathed
,
while
Cherokee
's
*NL*
wounds
increased
.
Both
sides
of
his
neck
and
head
were
ripped
and
*NL*
slashed
.
He
bled
freely
,
but
showed
no
signs
of
being
disconcerted
.
He
*NL*
continued
his
plodding
pursuit
,
though
once
,
for
the
moment
baffled
,
he
*NL*
came
to
a
full
stop
and
blinked
at
the
men
who
looked
on
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
wagging
his
stump
of
a
tail
as
an
expression
of
his
willingness
to
*NL*
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
moment
White
Fang
was
in
upon
him
and
out
,
in
passing
ripping
his
*NL*
trimmed
remnant
of
an
ear
.
With
a
slight
manifestation
of
anger
,
*NL*
Cherokee
took
up
the
pursuit
again
,
running
on
the
inside
of
the
circle
*NL*
White
Fang
was
making
,
and
striving
to
fasten
his
deadly
grip
on
White
*NL*
Fang
's
throat
.
The
bull-dog
missed
by
a
hair
's
-
breadth
,
and
cries
of
*NL*
praise
went
up
as
White
Fang
doubled
suddenly
out
of
danger
in
the
*NL*
opposite
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
went
by
.
White
Fang
still
danced
on
,
dodging
and
doubling
,
*NL*
leaping
in
and
out
,
and
ever
inflicting
damage
.
And
still
the
bull-dog
,
*NL*
with
grim
certitude
,
toiled
after
him
.
Sooner
or
later
he
would
*NL*
accomplish
his
purpose
,
get
the
grip
that
would
win
the
battle
.
In
the
*NL*
meantime
,
he
accepted
all
the
punishment
the
other
could
deal
him
.
His
*NL*
tufts
of
ears
had
become
tassels
,
his
neck
and
shoulders
were
slashed
in
*NL*
a
score
of
places
,
and
his
very
lips
were
cut
and
bleeding
--
all
from
*NL*
these
lightning
snaps
that
were
beyond
his
foreseeing
and
guarding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
and
again
White
Fang
had
attempted
to
knock
Cherokee
off
his
feet
;
*NL*
but
the
difference
in
their
height
was
too
great
.
Cherokee
was
too
*NL*
squat
,
too
close
to
the
ground
.
White
Fang
tried
the
trick
once
too
*NL*
often
.
The
chance
came
in
one
of
his
quick
doublings
and
*NL*
counter-circlings
.
He
caught
Cherokee
with
head
turned
away
as
he
*NL*
whirled
more
slowly
.
His
shoulder
was
exposed
.
White
Fang
drove
in
upon
*NL*
it
:
but
his
own
shoulder
was
high
above
,
while
he
struck
with
such
force
*NL*
that
his
momentum
carried
him
on
across
over
the
other
's
body
.
For
the
*NL*
first
time
in
his
fighting
history
,
men
saw
White
Fang
lose
his
footing
.
*NL*
His
body
turned
a
half-somersault
in
the
air
,
and
he
would
have
landed
on
*NL*
his
back
had
he
not
twisted
,
catlike
,
still
in
the
air
,
in
the
effort
to
*NL*
bring
his
feet
to
the
earth
.
As
it
was
,
he
struck
heavily
on
his
side
.
*NL*
The
next
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
,
but
in
that
instant
Cherokee
's
teeth
*NL*
closed
on
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
good
grip
,
being
too
low
down
toward
the
chest
;
but
Cherokee
*NL*
held
on
.
White
Fang
sprang
to
his
feet
and
tore
wildly
around
,
trying
to
*NL*
shake
off
the
bull-dog
's
body
.
It
made
him
frantic
,
this
clinging
,
*NL*
dragging
weight
.
It
bound
his
movements
,
restricted
his
freedom
.
It
was
*NL*
like
the
trap
,
and
all
his
instinct
resented
it
and
revolted
against
it
.
*NL*
It
was
a
mad
revolt
.
For
several
minutes
he
was
to
all
intents
insane
.
*NL*
The
basic
life
that
was
in
him
took
charge
of
him
.
The
will
to
exist
of
*NL*
his
body
surged
over
him
.
He
was
dominated
by
this
mere
flesh-love
of
*NL*
life
.
All
intelligence
was
gone
.
It
was
as
though
he
had
no
brain
.
His
*NL*
reason
was
unseated
by
the
blind
yearning
of
the
flesh
to
exist
and
move
,
*NL*
at
all
hazards
to
move
,
to
continue
to
move
,
for
movement
was
the
*NL*
expression
of
its
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Round
and
round
he
went
,
whirling
and
turning
and
reversing
,
trying
to
*NL*
shake
off
the
fifty-pound
weight
that
dragged
at
his
throat
.
The
bull
-
*NL*
dog
did
little
but
keep
his
grip
.
Sometimes
,
and
rarely
,
he
managed
to
*NL*
get
his
feet
to
the
earth
and
for
a
moment
to
brace
himself
against
White
*NL*
Fang
.
But
the
next
moment
his
footing
would
be
lost
and
he
would
be
*NL*
dragging
around
in
the
whirl
of
one
of
White
Fang
's
mad
gyrations
.
*NL*
Cherokee
identified
himself
with
his
instinct
.
He
knew
that
he
was
doing
*NL*
the
right
thing
by
holding
on
,
and
there
came
to
him
certain
blissful
*NL*
thrills
of
satisfaction
.
At
such
moments
he
even
closed
his
eyes
and
*NL*
allowed
his
body
to
be
hurled
hither
and
thither
,
willy-nilly
,
careless
*NL*
of
any
hurt
that
might
thereby
come
to
it
.
That
did
not
count
.
The
grip
*NL*
was
the
thing
,
and
the
grip
he
kept
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
ceased
only
when
he
had
tired
himself
out
.
He
could
do
*NL*
nothing
,
and
he
could
not
understand
.
Never
,
in
all
his
fighting
,
had
*NL*
this
thing
happened
.
The
dogs
he
had
fought
with
did
not
fight
that
way
.
*NL*
With
them
it
was
snap
and
slash
and
get
away
,
snap
and
slash
and
get
*NL*
away
.
He
lay
partly
on
his
side
,
panting
for
breath
.
Cherokee
still
*NL*
holding
his
grip
,
urged
against
him
,
trying
to
get
him
over
entirely
on
*NL*
his
side
.
White
Fang
resisted
,
and
he
could
feel
the
jaws
shifting
their
*NL*
grip
,
slightly
relaxing
and
coming
together
again
in
a
chewing
movement
.
*NL*
Each
shift
brought
the
grip
closer
to
his
throat
.
The
bull-dog
's
method
*NL*
was
to
hold
what
he
had
,
and
when
opportunity
favoured
to
work
in
for
*NL*
more
.
Opportunity
favoured
when
White
Fang
remained
quiet
.
When
White
*NL*
Fang
struggled
,
Cherokee
was
content
merely
to
hold
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bulging
back
of
Cherokee
's
neck
was
the
only
portion
of
his
body
that
*NL*
White
Fang
's
teeth
could
reach
.
He
got
hold
toward
the
base
where
the
*NL*
neck
comes
out
from
the
shoulders
;
but
he
did
not
know
the
chewing
method
*NL*
of
fighting
,
nor
were
his
jaws
adapted
to
it
.
He
spasmodically
ripped
*NL*
and
tore
with
his
fangs
for
a
space
.
Then
a
change
in
their
position
*NL*
diverted
him
.
The
bull-dog
had
managed
to
roll
him
over
on
his
back
,
and
*NL*
still
hanging
on
to
his
throat
,
was
on
top
of
him
.
Like
a
cat
,
White
*NL*
Fang
bowed
his
hind-quarters
in
,
and
,
with
the
feet
digging
into
his
*NL*
enemy
's
abdomen
above
him
,
he
began
to
claw
with
long
tearing-strokes
.
*NL*
Cherokee
might
well
have
been
disembowelled
had
he
not
quickly
pivoted
on
*NL*
his
grip
and
got
his
body
off
of
White
Fang
's
and
at
right
angles
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
escaping
that
grip
.
It
was
like
Fate
itself
,
and
as
*NL*
inexorable
.
Slowly
it
shifted
up
along
the
jugular
.
All
that
saved
*NL*
White
Fang
from
death
was
the
loose
skin
of
his
neck
and
the
thick
fur
*NL*
that
covered
it
.
This
served
to
form
a
large
roll
in
Cherokee
's
mouth
,
*NL*
the
fur
of
which
well-nigh
defied
his
teeth
.
But
bit
by
bit
,
whenever
*NL*
the
chance
offered
,
he
was
getting
more
of
the
loose
skin
and
fur
in
his
*NL*
mouth
.
The
result
was
that
he
was
slowly
throttling
White
Fang
.
The
*NL*
latter
's
breath
was
drawn
with
greater
and
greater
difficulty
as
the
*NL*
moments
went
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
to
look
as
though
the
battle
were
over
.
The
backers
of
Cherokee
*NL*
waxed
jubilant
and
offered
ridiculous
odds
.
White
Fang
's
backers
were
*NL*
correspondingly
depressed
,
and
refused
bets
of
ten
to
one
and
twenty
to
*NL*
one
,
though
one
man
was
rash
enough
to
close
a
wager
of
fifty
to
one
.
*NL*
This
man
was
Beauty
Smith
.
He
took
a
step
into
the
ring
and
pointed
his
*NL*
finger
at
White
Fang
.
Then
he
began
to
laugh
derisively
and
scornfully
.
*NL*
This
produced
the
desired
effect
.
White
Fang
went
wild
with
rage
.
He
*NL*
called
up
his
reserves
of
strength
,
and
gained
his
feet
.
As
he
struggled
*NL*
around
the
ring
,
the
fifty
pounds
of
his
foe
ever
dragging
on
his
throat
,
*NL*
his
anger
passed
on
into
panic
.
The
basic
life
of
him
dominated
him
*NL*
again
,
and
his
intelligence
fled
before
the
will
of
his
flesh
to
live
.
*NL*
Round
and
round
and
back
again
,
stumbling
and
falling
and
rising
,
even
*NL*
uprearing
at
times
on
his
hind-legs
and
lifting
his
foe
clear
of
the
*NL*
earth
,
he
struggled
vainly
to
shake
off
the
clinging
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
fell
,
toppling
backward
,
exhausted
;
and
the
bull-dog
promptly
*NL*
shifted
his
grip
,
getting
in
closer
,
mangling
more
and
more
of
the
fur
-
*NL*
folded
flesh
,
throttling
White
Fang
more
severely
than
ever
.
Shouts
of
*NL*
applause
went
up
for
the
victor
,
and
there
were
many
cries
of
``
Cherokee
!
''
*NL*
``
Cherokee
!
''
To
this
Cherokee
responded
by
vigorous
wagging
of
the
stump
*NL*
of
his
tail
.
But
the
clamour
of
approval
did
not
distract
him
.
There
*NL*
was
no
sympathetic
relation
between
his
tail
and
his
massive
jaws
.
The
*NL*
one
might
wag
,
but
the
others
held
their
terrible
grip
on
White
Fang
's
*NL*
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
time
that
a
diversion
came
to
the
spectators
.
There
was
a
*NL*
jingle
of
bells
.
Dog-mushers
'
cries
were
heard
.
Everybody
,
save
Beauty
*NL*
Smith
,
looked
apprehensively
,
the
fear
of
the
police
strong
upon
them
.
*NL*
But
they
saw
,
up
the
trail
,
and
not
down
,
two
men
running
with
sled
and
*NL*
dogs
.
They
were
evidently
coming
down
the
creek
from
some
prospecting
*NL*
trip
.
At
sight
of
the
crowd
they
stopped
their
dogs
and
came
over
and
*NL*
joined
it
,
curious
to
see
the
cause
of
the
excitement
.
The
dog-musher
*NL*
wore
a
moustache
,
but
the
other
,
a
taller
and
younger
man
,
was
smooth
-
*NL*
shaven
,
his
skin
rosy
from
the
pounding
of
his
blood
and
the
running
in
*NL*
the
frosty
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
had
practically
ceased
struggling
.
Now
and
again
he
resisted
*NL*
spasmodically
and
to
no
purpose
.
He
could
get
little
air
,
and
that
*NL*
little
grew
less
and
less
under
the
merciless
grip
that
ever
tightened
.
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
armour
of
fur
,
the
great
vein
of
his
throat
would
have
*NL*
long
since
been
torn
open
,
had
not
the
first
grip
of
the
bull-dog
been
so
*NL*
low
down
as
to
be
practically
on
the
chest
.
It
had
taken
Cherokee
a
long
*NL*
time
to
shift
that
grip
upward
,
and
this
had
also
tended
further
to
clog
*NL*
his
jaws
with
fur
and
skin-fold
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
abysmal
brute
in
Beauty
Smith
had
been
rising
into
*NL*
his
brain
and
mastering
the
small
bit
of
sanity
that
he
possessed
at
*NL*
best
.
When
he
saw
White
Fang
's
eyes
beginning
to
glaze
,
he
knew
beyond
*NL*
doubt
that
the
fight
was
lost
.
Then
he
broke
loose
.
He
sprang
upon
*NL*
White
Fang
and
began
savagely
to
kick
him
.
There
were
hisses
from
the
*NL*
crowd
and
cries
of
protest
,
but
that
was
all
.
While
this
went
on
,
and
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
continued
to
kick
White
Fang
,
there
was
a
commotion
in
the
*NL*
crowd
.
The
tall
young
newcomer
was
forcing
his
way
through
,
shouldering
*NL*
men
right
and
left
without
ceremony
or
gentleness
.
When
he
broke
through
*NL*
into
the
ring
,
Beauty
Smith
was
just
in
the
act
of
delivering
another
*NL*
kick
.
All
his
weight
was
on
one
foot
,
and
he
was
in
a
state
of
unstable
*NL*
equilibrium
.
At
that
moment
the
newcomer
's
fist
landed
a
smashing
blow
*NL*
full
in
his
face
.
Beauty
Smith
's
remaining
leg
left
the
ground
,
and
his
*NL*
whole
body
seemed
to
lift
into
the
air
as
he
turned
over
backward
and
*NL*
struck
the
snow
.
The
newcomer
turned
upon
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
cowards
!
''
he
cried
.
``
You
beasts
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
a
rage
himself
--
a
sane
rage
.
His
grey
eyes
seemed
metallic
and
*NL*
steel-like
as
they
flashed
upon
the
crowd
.
Beauty
Smith
regained
his
*NL*
feet
and
came
toward
him
,
sniffling
and
cowardly
.
The
new-comer
did
not
*NL*
understand
.
He
did
not
know
how
abject
a
coward
the
other
was
,
and
*NL*
thought
he
was
coming
back
intent
on
fighting
.
So
,
with
a
``
You
beast
!
''
*NL*
he
smashed
Beauty
Smith
over
backward
with
a
second
blow
in
the
face
.
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
decided
that
the
snow
was
the
safest
place
for
him
,
and
lay
*NL*
where
he
had
fallen
,
making
no
effort
to
get
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
Matt
,
lend
a
hand
,
''
the
newcomer
called
the
dog-musher
,
who
had
*NL*
followed
him
into
the
ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
men
bent
over
the
dogs
.
Matt
took
hold
of
White
Fang
,
ready
to
pull
*NL*
when
Cherokee
's
jaws
should
be
loosened
.
This
the
younger
man
*NL*
endeavoured
to
accomplish
by
clutching
the
bulldog
's
jaws
in
his
hands
*NL*
and
trying
to
spread
them
.
It
was
a
vain
undertaking
.
As
he
pulled
and
*NL*
tugged
and
wrenched
,
he
kept
exclaiming
with
every
expulsion
of
breath
,
*NL*
``
Beasts
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
began
to
grow
unruly
,
and
some
of
the
men
were
protesting
*NL*
against
the
spoiling
of
the
sport
;
but
they
were
silenced
when
the
*NL*
newcomer
lifted
his
head
from
his
work
for
a
moment
and
glared
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
damn
beasts
!
''
he
finally
exploded
,
and
went
back
to
his
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
,
Mr.
Scott
,
you
ca
n't
break
'm
apart
that
way
,
''
Matt
said
at
*NL*
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pair
paused
and
surveyed
the
locked
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
bleedin
'
much
,
''
Matt
announced
.
``
Ai
n't
got
all
the
way
in
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
's
liable
to
any
moment
,
''
Scott
answered
.
``
There
,
did
you
see
*NL*
that
!
He
shifted
his
grip
in
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
younger
man
's
excitement
and
apprehension
for
White
Fang
was
growing
.
*NL*
He
struck
Cherokee
about
the
head
savagely
again
and
again
.
But
that
did
*NL*
not
loosen
the
jaws
.
Cherokee
wagged
the
stump
of
his
tail
in
*NL*
advertisement
that
he
understood
the
meaning
of
the
blows
,
but
that
he
*NL*
knew
he
was
himself
in
the
right
and
only
doing
his
duty
by
keeping
his
*NL*
grip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
some
of
you
help
?
''
Scott
cried
desperately
at
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
help
was
offered
.
Instead
,
the
crowd
began
sarcastically
to
cheer
*NL*
him
on
and
showered
him
with
facetious
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
get
a
pry
,
''
Matt
counselled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
reached
into
the
holster
at
his
hip
,
drew
his
revolver
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
thrust
its
muzzle
between
the
bull-dog
's
jaws
.
He
shoved
,
and
*NL*
shoved
hard
,
till
the
grating
of
the
steel
against
the
locked
teeth
could
*NL*
be
distinctly
heard
.
Both
men
were
on
their
knees
,
bending
over
the
*NL*
dogs
.
Tim
Keenan
strode
into
the
ring
.
He
paused
beside
Scott
and
*NL*
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
,
saying
ominously
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
break
them
teeth
,
stranger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
break
his
neck
,
''
Scott
retorted
,
continuing
his
shoving
and
*NL*
wedging
with
the
revolver
muzzle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
do
n't
break
them
teeth
,
''
the
faro-dealer
repeated
more
ominously
*NL*
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
it
was
a
bluff
he
intended
,
it
did
not
work
.
Scott
never
desisted
*NL*
from
his
efforts
,
though
he
looked
up
coolly
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
dog
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
faro-dealer
grunted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
get
in
here
and
break
this
grip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
stranger
,
''
the
other
drawled
irritatingly
,
``
I
do
n't
mind
telling
*NL*
you
that
's
something
I
ai
n't
worked
out
for
myself
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
*NL*
turn
the
trick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
get
out
of
the
way
,
''
was
the
reply
,
``
and
do
n't
bother
me
.
I
'm
*NL*
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tim
Keenan
continued
standing
over
him
,
but
Scott
took
no
further
notice
*NL*
of
his
presence
.
He
had
managed
to
get
the
muzzle
in
between
the
jaws
on
*NL*
one
side
,
and
was
trying
to
get
it
out
between
the
jaws
on
the
other
*NL*
side
.
This
accomplished
,
he
pried
gently
and
carefully
,
loosening
the
*NL*
jaws
a
bit
at
a
time
,
while
Matt
,
a
bit
at
a
time
,
extricated
White
*NL*
Fang
's
mangled
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
by
to
receive
your
dog
,
''
was
Scott
's
peremptory
order
to
*NL*
Cherokee
's
owner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
faro-dealer
stooped
down
obediently
and
got
a
firm
hold
on
Cherokee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
!
''
Scott
warned
,
giving
the
final
pry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dogs
were
drawn
apart
,
the
bull-dog
struggling
vigorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
him
away
,
''
Scott
commanded
,
and
Tim
Keenan
dragged
Cherokee
back
*NL*
into
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
made
several
ineffectual
efforts
to
get
up
.
Once
he
gained
*NL*
his
feet
,
but
his
legs
were
too
weak
to
sustain
him
,
and
he
slowly
wilted
*NL*
and
sank
back
into
the
snow
.
His
eyes
were
half
closed
,
and
the
surface
*NL*
of
them
was
glassy
.
His
jaws
were
apart
,
and
through
them
the
tongue
*NL*
protruded
,
draggled
and
limp
.
To
all
appearances
he
looked
like
a
dog
*NL*
that
had
been
strangled
to
death
.
Matt
examined
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
about
all
in
,
''
he
announced
;
``
but
he
's
breathin
'
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
had
regained
his
feet
and
come
over
to
look
at
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matt
,
how
much
is
a
good
sled-dog
worth
?
''
Scott
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog-musher
,
still
on
his
knees
and
stooped
over
White
Fang
,
*NL*
calculated
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
hundred
dollars
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
for
one
that
's
all
chewed
up
like
this
one
?
''
Scott
asked
,
*NL*
nudging
White
Fang
with
his
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
of
that
,
''
was
the
dog-musher
's
judgment
.
Scott
turned
upon
Beauty
*NL*
Smith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
,
Mr.
Beast
?
I
'm
going
to
take
your
dog
from
you
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
give
you
a
hundred
and
fifty
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
his
pocket-book
and
counted
out
the
bills
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
,
refusing
to
touch
the
*NL*
proffered
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ai
n't
a-sellin
'
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
you
are
,
''
the
other
assured
him
.
``
Because
I
'm
buying
.
Here
's
*NL*
your
money
.
The
dog
's
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
,
his
hands
still
behind
him
,
began
to
back
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scott
sprang
toward
him
,
drawing
his
fist
back
to
strike
.
Beauty
Smith
*NL*
cowered
down
in
anticipation
of
the
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
my
rights
,
''
he
whimpered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
forfeited
your
rights
to
own
that
dog
,
''
was
the
rejoinder
.
``
Are
*NL*
you
going
to
take
the
money
?
or
do
I
have
to
hit
you
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
Beauty
Smith
spoke
up
with
the

passing

*NL*
``

the

with

*NL*
*NL*
``

grunted

shrinking
away

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
Beauty
Smith
snarled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look

''
some
one
shouted
,
and
a
guffaw
of
laughter
went
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scott
turned
his
back
on
him
,
and
returned
to
help
the
dog-musher
,
who
*NL*
was
working
over
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
men
were
already
departing
;
others
stood
in
groups
,
looking
*NL*
on
and
talking
.
Tim
Keenan
joined
one
of
the
groups
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
mug

he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*

answered

*NL*
``
And

the
faro-dealer
demanded

*NL*

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
INDOMITABLE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
hopeless
,
''
Weedon
Scott
confessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
on
the
step
of
his
cabin
and
stared
at
the
dog-musher
,
who
*NL*
responded
with
a
shrug
that
was
equally
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Together
they
looked
at
White
Fang
at
the
end
of
his
stretched
chain
,
*NL*
bristling
,
snarling
,
ferocious
,
straining
to
get
at
the
sled-dogs
.
Having
*NL*
received
sundry
lessons
from
Matt
,
said
lessons
being
imparted
by
means
*NL*
of
a
club
,
the
sled-dogs
had
learned
to
leave
White
Fang
alone
;
and
even
*NL*
then
they
were
lying
down
at
a
distance
,
apparently
oblivious
of
his
*NL*
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
wolf
and
there
's
no
taming
it
,
''
Weedon
Scott
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
''
Matt
objected
.
``
Might
be
a
lot
of
dog
in
*NL*
'm
,
for
all
you
can
tell
.
But
there
's
one
thing
I
know
sure
,
an
'
that
*NL*
there
's
no
gettin
'
away
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog-musher
paused
and
nodded
his
head
confidentially
at
Moosehide
*NL*
Mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
n't
be
a
miser
with
what
you
know
,
''
Scott
said
sharply
,
after
*NL*
waiting
a
suitable
length
of
time
.
``
Spit
it
out
.
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog-musher
indicated
White
Fang
with
a
backward
thrust
of
his
thumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wolf
or
dog
,
it
's
all
the
same
--
he
's
ben
tamed
`
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
yes
,
an
'
broke
to
harness
.
Look
close
there
.
D'ye
see
them
*NL*
marks
across
the
chest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
,
Matt
.
He
was
a
sled-dog
before
Beauty
Smith
got
hold
of
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
's
not
much
reason
against
his
bein
'
a
sled-dog
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
d'ye
think
?
''
Scott
queried
eagerly
.
Then
the
hope
died
down
as
he
*NL*
added
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
We
've
had
him
two
weeks
now
,
and
if
anything
*NL*
he
's
wilder
than
ever
at
the
present
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
'm
a
chance
,
''
Matt
counselled
.
``
Turn
'm
loose
for
a
spell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
looked
at
him
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Matt
went
on
,
``
I
know
you
've
tried
to
,
but
you
did
n't
take
a
*NL*
club
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
try
it
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog-musher
secured
a
club
and
went
over
to
the
chained
animal
.
White
*NL*
Fang
watched
the
club
after
the
manner
of
a
caged
lion
watching
the
whip
*NL*
of
its
trainer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
'm
keep
his
eye
on
that
club
,
''
Matt
said
.
``
That
's
a
good
sign
.
He
's
*NL*
no
fool
.
Do
n't
dast
tackle
me
so
long
as
I
got
that
club
handy
.
He
's
*NL*
not
clean
crazy
,
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
man
's
hand
approached
his
neck
,
White
Fang
bristled
and
snarled
*NL*
and
crouched
down
.
But
while
he
eyed
the
approaching
hand
,
he
at
the
*NL*
same
time
contrived
to
keep
track
of
the
club
in
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
suspended
threateningly
above
him
.
Matt
unsnapped
the
chain
from
the
*NL*
collar
and
stepped
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
could
scarcely
realise
that
he
was
free
.
Many
months
had
gone
*NL*
by
since
he
passed
into
the
possession
of
Beauty
Smith
,
and
in
all
that
*NL*
period
he
had
never
known
a
moment
of
freedom
except
at
the
times
he
had
*NL*
been
loosed
to
fight
with
other
dogs
.
Immediately
after
such
fights
he
*NL*
had
always
been
imprisoned
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
Perhaps
some
new
devilry
of
the
gods
*NL*
was
about
to
be
perpetrated
on
him
.
He
walked
slowly
and
cautiously
,
*NL*
prepared
to
be
assailed
at
any
moment
.
He
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
it
*NL*
was
all
so
unprecedented
.
He
took
the
precaution
to
sheer
off
from
the
*NL*
two
watching
gods
,
and
walked
carefully
to
the
corner
of
the
cabin
.
*NL*
Nothing
happened
.
He
was
plainly
perplexed
,
and
he
came
back
again
,
*NL*
pausing
a
dozen
feet
away
and
regarding
the
two
men
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
he
run
away
?
''
his
new
owner
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
Got
to
take
a
gamble
.
Only
way
to
find
*NL*
out
is
to
find
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
devil
,
''
Scott
murmured
pityingly
.
``
What
he
needs
is
some
show
of
*NL*
human
kindness
,
''
he
added
,
turning
and
going
into
the
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
out
with
a
piece
of
meat
,
which
he
tossed
to
White
Fang
.
He
*NL*
sprang
away
from
it
,
and
from
a
distance
studied
it
suspiciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi-yu
,
Major
!
''
Matt
shouted
warningly
,
but
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
Major
had
made
a
spring
for
the
meat
.
At
the
instant
his
jaws
closed
on
*NL*
it
,
White
Fang
struck
him
.
He
was
overthrown
.
Matt
rushed
in
,
but
*NL*
quicker
than
he
was
White
Fang
.
Major
staggered
to
his
feet
,
but
the
*NL*
blood
spouting
from
his
throat
reddened
the
snow
in
a
widening
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
bad
,
but
it
served
him
right
,
''
Scott
said
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Matt
's
foot
had
already
started
on
its
way
to
kick
White
Fang
.
There
*NL*
was
a
leap
,
a
flash
of
teeth
,
a
sharp
exclamation
.
White
Fang
,
snarling
*NL*
fiercely
,
scrambled
backward
for
several
yards
,
while
Matt
stooped
and
*NL*
investigated
his
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
got
me
all
right
,
''
he
announced
,
pointing
to
the
torn
trousers
and
*NL*
undercloths
,
and
the
growing
stain
of
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
it
was
hopeless
,
Matt
,
''
Scott
said
in
a
discouraged
voice
.
*NL*
``
I
've
thought
about
it
off
and
on
,
while
not
wanting
to
think
of
it
.
But
*NL*
we
've
come
to
it
now
.
It
's
the
only
thing
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
talked
,
with
reluctant
movements
he
drew
his
revolver
,
threw
open
*NL*
the
cylinder
,
and
assured
himself
of
its
contents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Mr.
Scott
,
''
Matt
objected
;
``
that
dog
's
ben
through
hell
.
You
*NL*
ca
n't
expect
'm
to
come
out
a
white
an

shinin
'
angel
.
Give
'm
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
Major
,
''
the
other
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog-musher
surveyed
the
stricken
dog
.
He
had
sunk
down
on
the
snow
*NL*
in
the
circle
of
his
blood
and
was
plainly
in
the
last
gasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Served
'm
right
.
You
said
so
yourself
,
Mr.
Scott
.
He
tried
to
take
*NL*
White
Fang
's
meat
,
an
'
he
's
dead-O
.
That
was
to
be
expected
.
I
would
n't
*NL*
give
two
whoops
in
hell
for
a
dog
that
would
n't
fight
for
his
own
meat

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
look
at
yourself
,
Matt
.
It
's
all
right
about
the
dogs

but
we
must
*NL*
draw
the
line
somewhere

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Served
me
right

''
Matt
argued
stubbornly
.
``
What
'd
I
want
to
kick
'm
*NL*
for

You
said
yourself
that
he
'd
done
right

I
had
no
right

*NL*
kick

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
mercy
to
kill
him

Scott
insisted
.
``
He
's
untamable

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

Mr.
Scott

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
I
do
n't

have

killed

''
Scott
answered
,
*NL*
putting
away
the
revolver
.
``
We
'll
let
him
run
loose
and
see
what
*NL*
kindness
can
do
for
him
.
And
here
's
a
try
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
over
to
White
Fang
and
began
talking
to
him
gently
and
*NL*
soothingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
have
a
club
handy
,
''
Matt
warned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scott
shook
his
head
and
went
on
trying
to
win
White
Fang
's
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
was
suspicious
.
Something
was
impending
.
He
had
killed
this
*NL*
god
's
dog
,
bitten
his
companion
god
,
and
what
else
was
to
be
expected
*NL*
than
some
terrible
punishment
?
But
in
the
face
of
it
he
was
indomitable
.
*NL*
He
bristled
and
showed
his
teeth
,
his
eyes
vigilant
,
his
whole
body
wary
*NL*
and
prepared
for
anything
.
The
god
had
no
club
,
so
he
suffered
him
to
*NL*
approach
quite
near
.
The
god
's
hand
had
come
out
and
was
descending
upon
*NL*
his
head
.
White
Fang
shrank
together
and
grew
tense
as
he
crouched
under
*NL*
it
.
Here
was
danger
,
some
treachery
or
something
.
He
knew
the
hands
of
*NL*
the
gods
,
their
proved
mastery
,
their
cunning
to
hurt
.
Besides
,
there
*NL*
was
his
old
antipathy
to
being
touched
.
He
snarled
more
menacingly
,
*NL*
crouched
still
lower
,
and
still
the
hand
descended
.
He
did
not
want
to
*NL*
bite
the
hand
,
and
he
endured
the
peril
of
it
until
his
instinct
surged
*NL*
up
in
him
,
mastering
him
with
its
insatiable
yearning
for
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
had
believed
that
he
was
quick
enough
to
avoid
any
snap
or
*NL*
slash
.
But
he
had
yet
to
learn
the
remarkable
quickness
of
White
Fang
,
*NL*
who
struck
with
the
certainty
and
swiftness
of
a
coiled
snake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scott
cried
out
sharply
with
surprise
,
catching
his
torn
hand
and
holding
*NL*
it
tightly
in
his
other
hand
.
Matt
uttered
a
great
oath
and
sprang
to
*NL*
his
side
.
White
Fang
crouched
down
,
and
backed
away
,
bristling
,
showing
*NL*
his
fangs
,
his
eyes
malignant
with
menace
.
Now
he
could
expect
a
beating
*NL*
as
fearful
as
any
he
had
received
from
Beauty
Smith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
What
are
you
doing
?
''
Scott
cried
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
had
dashed
into
the
cabin
and
come
out
with
a
rifle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothin
'
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
with
a
careless
calmness
that
was
assumed
,
*NL*
``
only
goin
'
to
keep
that
promise
I
made
.
I
reckon
it
's
up
to
me
to
kill

I
said
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
you
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
I
do

Watch

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Matt
had
pleaded
for
White
Fang
when
he
had
been
bitten
,
it
was
now
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
's
turn
to
plead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
to
give
him
a
chance

Well

give
it
to
him

We

started
,
and
we
ca

look
at

''
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
,
near
the
corner
of
the
cabin
and
forty
feet
away
,
was
*NL*
snarling
with
blood-curdling
viciousness
,
not
at
Scott
,
but
at
the
dog
-
*NL*
musher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
everlastingly
gosh-swoggled
!
''
was
the
dog-musher
's
*NL*
expression
of
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
the
intelligence
of
him
,
''
Scott
went
on
hastily
.
``
He
knows
the
*NL*
meaning
of
firearms
as
well
as
you
do
.
He
's
got
intelligence
and
we
've
*NL*
got
to
give
that
intelligence
a
chance

Put
up
the
gun

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
I
'm
willin
'
,
''
Matt
agreed
,
leaning
the
rifle
against
the
*NL*
woodpile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
will
you
look
at
that
!
''
he
exclaimed
the
next
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
had
quieted
down
and
ceased
snarling
.
``
This
is
worth
*NL*
investigatin
'
.
Watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
,
reached
for
the
rifle
,
and
at
the
same
moment
White
Fang
snarled
.
*NL*
He
stepped
away
from
the
rifle
,
and
White
Fang
's
lifted
lips
descended
,
*NL*
covering
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
just
for
fun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
took
the
rifle
and
began
slowly
to
raise
it
to
his
shoulder
.
White
*NL*
Fang
's
snarling
began
with
the
movement
,
and
increased
as
the
movement
*NL*
approached
its
culmination
.
But
the
moment
before
the
rifle
came
to
a
*NL*
level
on
him
,
he
leaped
sidewise
behind
the
corner
of
the
cabin
.
Matt
*NL*
stood
staring
along
the
sights
at
the
empty
space
of
snow
which
had
been
*NL*
occupied
by
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog-musher
put
the
rifle
down
solemnly
,
then
turned
and
looked
at
his
*NL*
employer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
with
you

Mr.
Scott

That

too
intelligent

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
LOVE-MASTER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
White
Fang
watched
Weedon
Scott
approach
,
he
bristled
and
snarled
to
*NL*
advertise
that
he
would
not
submit
to
punishment
.
Twenty-four
hours
had
*NL*
passed
since
he
had
slashed
open
the
hand
that
was
now
bandaged
and
held
*NL*
up
by
a
sling
to
keep
the
blood
out
of
it
.
In
the
past
White
Fang
had
*NL*
experienced
delayed
punishments
,
and
he
apprehended
that
such
a
one
was
*NL*
about
to
befall
him
.
How
could
it
be
otherwise
?
He
had
committed
what
*NL*
was
to
him
sacrilege
,
sunk
his
fangs
into
the
holy
flesh
of
a
god
,
and
of
*NL*
a
white-skinned
superior
god
at
that
.
In
the
nature
of
things
,
and
of
*NL*
intercourse
with
gods
,
something
terrible
awaited
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
god
sat
down
several
feet
away
.
White
Fang
could
see
nothing
*NL*
dangerous
in
that
.
When
the
gods
administered
punishment
they
stood
on
*NL*
their
legs
.
Besides
,
this
god
had
no
club
,
no
whip
,
no
firearm
.
And
*NL*
furthermore
,
he
himself
was
free
.
No
chain
nor
stick
bound
him
.
He
*NL*
could
escape
into
safety
while
the
god
was
scrambling
to
his
feet
.
In
*NL*
the
meantime
he
would
wait
and
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
god
remained
quiet
,
made
no
movement
;
and
White
Fang
's
snarl
slowly
*NL*
dwindled
to
a
growl
that
ebbed
down
in
his
throat
and
ceased
.
Then
the
*NL*
god
spoke
,
and
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
,
the
hair
rose
on
White
*NL*
Fang
's
neck
and
the
growl
rushed
up
in
his
throat
.
But
the
god
made
no
*NL*
hostile
movement
,
and
went
on
calmly
talking
.
For
a
time
White
Fang
*NL*
growled
in
unison
with
him
,
a
correspondence
of
rhythm
being
established
*NL*
between
growl
and
voice
.
But
the
god
talked
on
interminably
.
He
talked
*NL*
to
White
Fang
as
White
Fang
had
never
been
talked
to
before
.
He
talked
*NL*
softly
and
soothingly
,
with
a
gentleness
that
somehow
,
somewhere
,
touched
*NL*
White
Fang
.
In
spite
of
himself
and
all
the
pricking
warnings
of
his
*NL*
instinct
,
White
Fang
began
to
have
confidence
in
this
god
.
He
had
a
*NL*
feeling
of
security
that
was
belied
by
all
his
experience
with
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
long
time
,
the
god
got
up
and
went
into
the
cabin
.
White
Fang
*NL*
scanned
him
apprehensively
when
he
came
out
.
He
had
neither
whip
nor
*NL*
club
nor
weapon
.
Nor
was
his
uninjured
hand
behind
his
back
hiding
*NL*
something
.
He
sat
down
as
before
,
in
the
same
spot
,
several
feet
away
.
*NL*
He
held
out
a
small
piece
of
meat
.
White
Fang
pricked
his
ears
and
*NL*
investigated
it
suspiciously
,
managing
to
look
at
the
same
time
both
at
*NL*
the
meat
and
the
god
,
alert
for
any
overt
act
,
his
body
tense
and
ready
*NL*
to
spring
away
at
the
first
sign
of
hostility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
punishment
delayed
.
The
god
merely
held
near
to
his
nose
a
*NL*
piece
of
meat
.
And
about
the
meat
there
seemed
nothing
wrong
.
Still
*NL*
White
Fang
suspected
;
and
though
the
meat
was
proffered
to
him
with
short
*NL*
inviting
thrusts
of
the
hand
,
he
refused
to
touch
it
.
The
gods
were
all
-
*NL*
wise
,
and
there
was
no
telling
what
masterful
treachery
lurked
behind
*NL*
that
apparently
harmless
piece
of
meat
.
In
past
experience
,
especially
*NL*
in
dealing
with
squaws
,
meat
and
punishment
had
often
been
disastrously
*NL*
related
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
end
,
the
god
tossed
the
meat
on
the
snow
at
White
Fang
's
feet
.
He
*NL*
smelled
the
meat
carefully
;
but
he
did
not
look
at
it
.
While
he
smelled
*NL*
it
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
god
.
Nothing
happened
.
He
took
the
meat
into
*NL*
his
mouth
and
swallowed
it
.
Still
nothing
happened
.
The
god
was
*NL*
actually
offering
him
another
piece
of
meat
.
Again
he
refused
to
take
it
*NL*
from
the
hand
,
and
again
it
was
tossed
to
him
.
This
was
repeated
a
*NL*
number
of
times
.
But
there
came
a
time
when
the
god
refused
to
toss
it
.
*NL*
He
kept
it
in
his
hand
and
steadfastly
proffered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meat
was
good
meat
,
and
White
Fang
was
hungry
.
Bit
by
bit
,
*NL*
infinitely
cautious
,
he
approached
the
hand
.
At
last
the
time
came
that
*NL*
he
decided
to
eat
the
meat
from
the
hand
.
He
never
took
his
eyes
from
*NL*
the
god
,
thrusting
his
head
forward
with
ears
flattened
back
and
hair
*NL*
involuntarily
rising
and
cresting
on
his
neck
.
Also
a
low
growl
rumbled
*NL*
in
his
throat
as
warning
that
he
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
.
He
ate
the
*NL*
meat
,
and
nothing
happened
.
Piece
by
piece
,
he
ate
all
the
meat
,
and
*NL*
nothing
happened
.
Still
the
punishment
delayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
licked
his
chops
and
waited
.
The
god
went
on
talking
.
In
his
voice
*NL*
was
kindness
--
something
of
which
White
Fang
had
no
experience
whatever
.
*NL*
And
within
him
it
aroused
feelings
which
he
had
likewise
never
*NL*
experienced
before
.
He
was
aware
of
a
certain
strange
satisfaction
,
as
*NL*
though
some
need
were
being
gratified
,
as
though
some
void
in
his
being
*NL*
were
being
filled
.
Then
again
came
the
prod
of
his
instinct
and
the
*NL*
warning
of
past
experience
.
The
gods
were
ever
crafty
,
and
they
had
*NL*
unguessed
ways
of
attaining
their
ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
he
had
thought
so
!
There
it
came
now
,
the
god
's
hand
,
cunning
to
*NL*
hurt
,
thrusting
out
at
him
,
descending
upon
his
head
.
But
the
god
went
*NL*
on
talking
.
His
voice
was
soft
and
soothing
.
In
spite
of
the
menacing
*NL*
hand
,
the
voice
inspired
confidence
.
And
in
spite
of
the
assuring
voice
,
*NL*
the
hand
inspired
distrust
.
White
Fang
was
torn
by
conflicting
feelings
,
*NL*
impulses
.
It
seemed
he
would
fly
to
pieces
,
so
terrible
was
the
control
*NL*
he
was
exerting
,
holding
together
by
an
unwonted
indecision
the
counter
-
*NL*
forces
that
struggled
within
him
for
mastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
compromised
.
He
snarled
and
bristled
and
flattened
his
ears
.
But
he
*NL*
neither
snapped
nor
sprang
away
.
The
hand
descended
.
Nearer
and
nearer
*NL*
it
came
.
It
touched
the
ends
of
his
upstanding
hair
.
He
shrank
down
*NL*
under
it
.
It
followed
down
after
him
,
pressing
more
closely
against
him
.
*NL*
Shrinking
,
almost
shivering
,
he
still
managed
to
hold
himself
together
.
*NL*
It
was
a
torment
,
this
hand
that
touched
him
and
violated
his
instinct
.
*NL*
He
could
not
forget
in
a
day
all
the
evil
that
had
been
wrought
him
at
*NL*
the
hands
of
men
.
But
it
was
the
will
of
the
god
,
and
he
strove
to
*NL*
submit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hand
lifted
and
descended
again
in
a
patting
,
caressing
movement
.
*NL*
This
continued
,
but
every
time
the
hand
lifted
,
the
hair
lifted
under
it
.
*NL*
And
every
time
the
hand
descended
,
the
ears
flattened
down
and
a
*NL*
cavernous
growl
surged
in
his
throat
.
White
Fang
growled
and
growled
*NL*
with
insistent
warning
.
By
this
means
he
announced
that
he
was
prepared
*NL*
to
retaliate
for
any
hurt
he
might
receive
.
There
was
no
telling
when
*NL*
the
god
's
ulterior
motive
might
be
disclosed
.
At
any
moment
that
soft
,
*NL*
confidence-inspiring
voice
might
break
forth
in
a
roar
of
wrath
,
that
*NL*
gentle
and
caressing
hand
transform
itself
into
a
vice-like
grip
to
hold
*NL*
him
helpless
and
administer
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
god
talked
on
softly
,
and
ever
the
hand
rose
and
fell
with
non
-
*NL*
hostile
pats
.
White
Fang
experienced
dual
feelings
.
It
was
distasteful
*NL*
to
his
instinct
.
It
restrained
him
,
opposed
the
will
of
him
toward
*NL*
personal
liberty
.
And
yet
it
was
not
physically
painful
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
it
was
even
pleasant
,
in
a
physical
way
.
The
patting
movement
*NL*
slowly
and
carefully
changed
to
a
rubbing
of
the
ears
about
their
bases
,
*NL*
and
the
physical
pleasure
even
increased
a
little
.
Yet
he
continued
to
*NL*
fear
,
and
he
stood
on
guard
,
expectant
of
unguessed
evil
,
alternately
*NL*
suffering
and
enjoying
as
one
feeling
or
the
other
came
uppermost
and
*NL*
swayed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
gosh-swoggled
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
spoke
Matt
,
coming
out
of
the
cabin
,
his
sleeves
rolled
up
,
a
pan
of
*NL*
dirty
dish-water
in
his
hands
,
arrested
in
the
act
of
emptying
the
pan
by
*NL*
the
sight
of
Weedon
Scott
patting
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
instant
his
voice
broke
the
silence
,
White
Fang
leaped
back
,
*NL*
snarling
savagely
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
regarded
his
employer
with
grieved
disapproval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
mind
my
expressin
'
my
feelin
's
,
Mr.
Scott
,
I
'll
make
free
*NL*
to
say
you
're
seventeen
kinds
of
a
damn
fool
an
'
all
of
'em
different
,
*NL*
an
'
then
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
smiled
with
a
superior
air
,
gained
his
feet
,
and
walked
over
*NL*
to
White
Fang
.
He
talked
soothingly
to
him
,
but
not
for
long
,
then
*NL*
slowly
put
out
his
hand
,
rested
it
on
White
Fang
's
head
,
and
resumed
the
*NL*
interrupted
patting
.
White
Fang
endured
it
,
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
*NL*
suspiciously
,
not
upon
the
man
that
patted
him
,
but
upon
the
man
that
*NL*
stood
in
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
a
number
one
,
tip-top
minin
'
expert
,
all
right
all
right
,
''
*NL*
the
dog-musher
delivered
himself
oracularly
,
``
but
you
missed
the
chance
*NL*
of
your
life
when
you
was
a
boy
an
'
did
n't
run
off
an
'
join
a
circus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
snarled
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
but
this
time
did
not
leap
*NL*
away
from
under
the
hand
that
was
caressing
his
head
and
the
back
of
his
*NL*
neck
with
long
,
soothing
strokes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
White
Fang
--
the
ending
of
the
old
*NL*
life
and
the
reign
of
hate
.
A
new
and
incomprehensibly
fairer
life
was
*NL*
dawning
.
It
required
much
thinking
and
endless
patience
on
the
part
of
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
to
accomplish
this
.
And
on
the
part
of
White
Fang
it
*NL*
required
nothing
less
than
a
revolution
.
He
had
to
ignore
the
urges
and
*NL*
promptings
of
instinct
and
reason
,
defy
experience
,
give
the
lie
to
life
*NL*
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Life
,
as
he
had
known
it
,
not
only
had
had
no
place
in
it
for
much
that
*NL*
he
now
did
;
but
all
the
currents
had
gone
counter
to
those
to
which
he
*NL*
now
abandoned
himself
.
In
short
,
when
all
things
were
considered
,
he
had
*NL*
to
achieve
an
orientation
far
vaster
than
the
one
he
had
achieved
at
the
*NL*
time
he
came
voluntarily
in
from
the
Wild
and
accepted
Grey
Beaver
as
his
*NL*
lord
.
At
that
time
he
was
a
mere
puppy
,
soft
from
the
making
,
without
*NL*
form
,
ready
for
the
thumb
of
circumstance
to
begin
its
work
upon
him
.
But
*NL*
now
it
was
different
.
The
thumb
of
circumstance
had
done
its
work
only
*NL*
too
well
.
By
it
he
had
been
formed
and
hardened
into
the
Fighting
Wolf
,
*NL*
fierce
and
implacable
,
unloving
and
unlovable
.
To
accomplish
the
change
*NL*
was
like
a
reflux
of
being
,
and
this
when
the
plasticity
of
youth
was
no
*NL*
longer
his
;
when
the
fibre
of
him
had
become
tough
and
knotty
;
when
the
*NL*
warp
and
the
woof
of
him
had
made
of
him
an
adamantine
texture
,
harsh
and
*NL*
unyielding
;
when
the
face
of
his
spirit
had
become
iron
and
all
his
*NL*
instincts
and
axioms
had
crystallised
into
set
rules
,
cautions
,
dislikes
,
*NL*
and
desires
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
again
,
in
this
new
orientation
,
it
was
the
thumb
of
circumstance
that
*NL*
pressed
and
prodded
him
,
softening
that
which
had
become
hard
and
*NL*
remoulding
it
into
fairer
form
.
Weedon
Scott
was
in
truth
this
thumb
.
He
*NL*
had
gone
to
the
roots
of
White
Fang
's
nature
,
and
with
kindness
touched
*NL*
to
life
potencies
that
had
languished
and
well-nigh
perished
.
One
such
*NL*
potency
was
_
love
_
.
It
took
the
place
of
_
like
_
,
which
latter
had
been
*NL*
the
highest
feeling
that
thrilled
him
in
his
intercourse
with
the
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
love
did
not
come
in
a
day
.
It
began
with
_
like
_
and
out
of
it
*NL*
slowly
developed
.
White
Fang
did
not
run
away
,
though
he
was
allowed
to
*NL*
remain
loose
,
because
he
liked
this
new
god
.
This
was
certainly
better
*NL*
than
the
life
he
had
lived
in
the
cage
of
Beauty
Smith
,
and
it
was
*NL*
necessary
that
he
should
have
some
god
.
The
lordship
of
man
was
a
need
*NL*
of
his
nature
.
The
seal
of
his
dependence
on
man
had
been
set
upon
him
*NL*
in
that
early
day
when
he
turned
his
back
on
the
Wild
and
crawled
to
Grey
*NL*
Beaver
's
feet
to
receive
the
expected
beating
.
This
seal
had
been
*NL*
stamped
upon
him
again
,
and
ineradicably
,
on
his
second
return
from
the
*NL*
Wild
,
when
the
long
famine
was
over
and
there
was
fish
once
more
in
the
*NL*
village
of
Grey
Beaver
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
because
he
needed
a
god
and
because
he
preferred
Weedon
Scott
to
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
,
White
Fang
remained
.
In
acknowledgment
of
fealty
,
he
*NL*
proceeded
to
take
upon
himself
the
guardianship
of
his
master
's
property
.
*NL*
He
prowled
about
the
cabin
while
the
sled-dogs
slept
,
and
the
first
night
-
*NL*
visitor
to
the
cabin
fought
him
off
with
a
club
until
Weedon
Scott
came
*NL*
to
the
rescue
.
But
White
Fang
soon
learned
to
differentiate
between
*NL*
thieves
and
honest
men
,
to
appraise
the
true
value
of
step
and
carriage
.
*NL*
The
man
who
travelled
,
loud-stepping
,
the
direct
line
to
the
cabin
door
,
*NL*
he
let
alone
--
though
he
watched
him
vigilantly
until
the
door
opened
and
*NL*
he
received
the
endorsement
of
the
master
.
But
the
man
who
went
softly
,
*NL*
by
circuitous
ways
,
peering
with
caution
,
seeking
after
secrecy
--
that
was
*NL*
the
man
who
received
no
suspension
of
judgment
from
White
Fang
,
and
who
*NL*
went
away
abruptly
,
hurriedly
,
and
without
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
had
set
himself
the
task
of
redeeming
White
Fang
--
or
rather
,
*NL*
of
redeeming
mankind
from
the
wrong
it
had
done
White
Fang
.
It
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
principle
and
conscience
.
He
felt
that
the
ill
done
White
Fang
*NL*
was
a
debt
incurred
by
man
and
that
it
must
be
paid
.
So
he
went
out
of
*NL*
his
way
to
be
especially
kind
to
the
Fighting
Wolf
.
Each
day
he
made
it
*NL*
a
point
to
caress
and
pet
White
Fang
,
and
to
do
it
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
suspicious
and
hostile
,
White
Fang
grew
to
like
this
petting
.
*NL*
But
there
was
one
thing
that
he
never
outgrew
--
his
growling
.
Growl
he
*NL*
would
,
from
the
moment
the
petting
began
till
it
ended
.
But
it
was
a
*NL*
growl
with
a
new
note
in
it
.
A
stranger
could
not
hear
this
note
,
and
to
*NL*
such
a
stranger
the
growling
of
White
Fang
was
an
exhibition
of
*NL*
primordial
savagery
,
nerve-racking
and
blood-curdling
.
But
White
Fang
's
*NL*
throat
had
become
harsh-fibred
from
the
making
of
ferocious
sounds
*NL*
through
the
many
years
since
his
first
little
rasp
of
anger
in
the
lair
*NL*
of
his
cubhood
,
and
he
could
not
soften
the
sounds
of
that
throat
now
to
*NL*
express
the
gentleness
he
felt
.
Nevertheless
,
Weedon
Scott
's
ear
and
*NL*
sympathy
were
fine
enough
to
catch
the
new
note
all
but
drowned
in
the
*NL*
fierceness
--
the
note
that
was
the
faintest
hint
of
a
croon
of
content
and
*NL*
that
none
but
he
could
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
days
went
by
,
the
evolution
of
_
like
_
into
_
love
_
was
accelerated
.
*NL*
White
Fang
himself
began
to
grow
aware
of
it
,
though
in
his
consciousness
*NL*
he
knew
not
what
love
was
.
It
manifested
itself
to
him
as
a
void
in
his
*NL*
being
--
a
hungry
,
aching
,
yearning
void
that
clamoured
to
be
filled
.
It
*NL*
was
a
pain
and
an
unrest
;
and
it
received
easement
only
by
the
touch
of
*NL*
the
new
god
's
presence
.
At
such
times
love
was
joy
to
him
,
a
wild
,
keen
-
*NL*
thrilling
satisfaction
.
But
when
away
from
his
god
,
the
pain
and
the
*NL*
unrest
returned
;
the
void
in
him
sprang
up
and
pressed
against
him
with
*NL*
its
emptiness
,
and
the
hunger
gnawed
and
gnawed
unceasingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
was
in
the
process
of
finding
himself
.
In
spite
of
the
*NL*
maturity
of
his
years
and
of
the
savage
rigidity
of
the
mould
that
had
*NL*
formed
him
,
his
nature
was
undergoing
an
expansion
.
There
was
a
*NL*
burgeoning
within
him
of
strange
feelings
and
unwonted
impulses
.
His
old
*NL*
code
of
conduct
was
changing
.
In
the
past
he
had
liked
comfort
and
*NL*
surcease
from
pain
,
disliked
discomfort
and
pain
,
and
he
had
adjusted
his
*NL*
actions
accordingly
.
But
now
it
was
different
.
Because
of
this
new
*NL*
feeling
within
him
,
he
ofttimes
elected
discomfort
and
pain
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
his
god
.
Thus
,
in
the
early
morning
,
instead
of
roaming
and
foraging
,
*NL*
or
lying
in
a
sheltered
nook
,
he
would
wait
for
hours
on
the
cheerless
*NL*
cabin-stoop
for
a
sight
of
the
god
's
face
.
At
night
,
when
the
god
*NL*
returned
home
,
White
Fang
would
leave
the
warm
sleeping-place
he
had
*NL*
burrowed
in
the
snow
in
order
to
receive
the
friendly
snap
of
fingers
and
*NL*
the
word
of
greeting
.
Meat
,
even
meat
itself
,
he
would
forego
to
be
with
*NL*
his
god
,
to
receive
a
caress
from
him
or
to
accompany
him
down
into
the
*NL*
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Like
_
had
been
replaced
by
_
love
_
.
And
love
was
the
plummet
dropped
*NL*
down
into
the
deeps
of
him
where
like
had
never
gone
.
And
responsive
out
*NL*
of
his
deeps
had
come
the
new
thing
--
love
.
That
which
was
given
unto
him
*NL*
did
he
return
.
This
was
a
god
indeed
,
a
love-god
,
a
warm
and
radiant
*NL*
god
,
in
whose
light
White
Fang
's
nature
expanded
as
a
flower
expands
*NL*
under
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
White
Fang
was
not
demonstrative
.
He
was
too
old
,
too
firmly
*NL*
moulded
,
to
become
adept
at
expressing
himself
in
new
ways
.
He
was
too
*NL*
self-possessed
,
too
strongly
poised
in
his
own
isolation
.
Too
long
had
*NL*
he
cultivated
reticence
,
aloofness
,
and
moroseness
.
He
had
never
barked
*NL*
in
his
life
,
and
he
could
not
now
learn
to
bark
a
welcome
when
his
god
*NL*
approached
.
He
was
never
in
the
way
,
never
extravagant
nor
foolish
in
*NL*
the
expression
of
his
love
.
He
never
ran
to
meet
his
god
.
He
waited
at
*NL*
a
distance
;
but
he
always
waited
,
was
always
there
.
His
love
partook
of
*NL*
the
nature
of
worship
,
dumb
,
inarticulate
,
a
silent
adoration
.
Only
by
*NL*
the
steady
regard
of
his
eyes
did
he
express
his
love
,
and
by
the
*NL*
unceasing
following
with
his
eyes
of
his
god
's
every
movement
.
Also
,
at
*NL*
times
,
when
his
god
looked
at
him
and
spoke
to
him
,
he
betrayed
an
*NL*
awkward
self-consciousness
,
caused
by
the
struggle
of
his
love
to
express
*NL*
itself
and
his
physical
inability
to
express
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
learned
to
adjust
himself
in
many
ways
to
his
new
mode
of
life
.
It
*NL*
was
borne
in
upon
him
that
he
must
let
his
master
's
dogs
alone
.
Yet
his
*NL*
dominant
nature
asserted
itself
,
and
he
had
first
to
thrash
them
into
an
*NL*
acknowledgment
of
his
superiority
and
leadership
.
This
accomplished
,
he
*NL*
had
little
trouble
with
them
.
They
gave
trail
to
him
when
he
came
and
*NL*
went
or
walked
among
them
,
and
when
he
asserted
his
will
they
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
way
,
he
came
to
tolerate
Matt
--
as
a
possession
of
his
master
.
*NL*
His
master
rarely
fed
him
.
Matt
did
that
,
it
was
his
business
;
yet
White
*NL*
Fang
divined
that
it
was
his
master
's
food
he
ate
and
that
it
was
his
*NL*
master
who
thus
fed
him
vicariously
.
Matt
it
was
who
tried
to
put
him
*NL*
into
the
harness
and
make
him
haul
sled
with
the
other
dogs
.
But
Matt
*NL*
failed
.
It
was
not
until
Weedon
Scott
put
the
harness
on
White
Fang
and
*NL*
worked
him
,
that
he
understood
.
He
took
it
as
his
master
's
will
that
*NL*
Matt
should
drive
him
and
work
him
just
as
he
drove
and
worked
his
*NL*
master
's
other
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Different
from
the
Mackenzie
toboggans
were
the
Klondike
sleds
with
*NL*
runners
under
them
.
And
different
was
the
method
of
driving
the
dogs
.
*NL*
There
was
no
fan-formation
of
the
team
.
The
dogs
worked
in
single
file
,
*NL*
one
behind
another
,
hauling
on
double
traces
.
And
here
,
in
the
Klondike
,
*NL*
the
leader
was
indeed
the
leader
.
The
wisest
as
well
as
strongest
dog
*NL*
was
the
leader
,
and
the
team
obeyed
him
and
feared
him
.
That
White
Fang
*NL*
should
quickly
gain
this
post
was
inevitable
.
He
could
not
be
satisfied
*NL*
with
less
,
as
Matt
learned
after
much
inconvenience
and
trouble
.
White
*NL*
Fang
picked
out
the
post
for
himself
,
and
Matt
backed
his
judgment
with
*NL*
strong
language
after
the
experiment
had
been
tried
.
But
,
though
he
*NL*
worked
in
the
sled
in
the
day
,
White
Fang
did
not
forego
the
guarding
of
*NL*
his
master
's
property
in
the
night
.
Thus
he
was
on
duty
all
the
time
,
*NL*
ever
vigilant
and
faithful
,
the
most
valuable
of
all
the
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Makin
'
free
to
spit
out
what
's
in
me
,
''
Matt
said
one
day
,
``
I
beg
to
*NL*
state
that
you
was
a
wise
guy
all
right
when
you
paid
the
price
you
did
*NL*
for
that
dog
.
You
clean
swindled
Beauty
Smith
on
top
of
pushin
'
his
face
*NL*
in
with
your
fist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
recrudescence
of
anger
glinted
in
Weedon
Scott
's
grey
eyes
,
and
he
*NL*
muttered
savagely
,
``
The
beast
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
late
spring
a
great
trouble
came
to
White
Fang
.
Without
warning
,
*NL*
the
love-master
disappeared
.
There
had
been
warning
,
but
White
Fang
was
*NL*
unversed
in
such
things
and
did
not
understand
the
packing
of
a
grip
.
He
*NL*
remembered
afterwards
that
his
packing
had
preceded
the
master
's
*NL*
disappearance
;
but
at
the
time
he
suspected
nothing
.
That
night
he
*NL*
waited
for
the
master
to
return
.
At
midnight
the
chill
wind
that
blew
*NL*
drove
him
to
shelter
at
the
rear
of
the
cabin
.
There
he
drowsed
,
only
*NL*
half
asleep
,
his
ears
keyed
for
the
first
sound
of
the
familiar
step
.
*NL*
But
,
at
two
in
the
morning
,
his
anxiety
drove
him
out
to
the
cold
front
*NL*
stoop
,
where
he
crouched
,
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
master
came
.
In
the
morning
the
door
opened
and
Matt
stepped
*NL*
outside
.
White
Fang
gazed
at
him
wistfully
.
There
was
no
common
speech
*NL*
by
which
he
might
learn
what
he
wanted
to
know
.
The
days
came
and
went
,
*NL*
but
never
the
master
.
White
Fang
,
who
had
never
known
sickness
in
his
*NL*
life
,
became
sick
.
He
became
very
sick
,
so
sick
that
Matt
was
finally
*NL*
compelled
to
bring
him
inside
the
cabin
.
Also
,
in
writing
to
his
*NL*
employer
,
Matt
devoted
a
postscript
to
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
reading
the
letter
down
in
Circle
City
,
came
upon
the
*NL*
following
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
dam
wolf
wo
n't
work
.
Wo
n't
eat
.
Aint
got
no
spunk
left
.
All
the
*NL*
dogs
is
licking
him
.
Wants
to
know
what
has
become
of
you
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
tell
him
.
Mebbe
he
is
going
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
Matt
had
said
.
White
Fang
had
ceased
eating
,
lost
heart
,
and
*NL*
allowed
every
dog
of
the
team
to
thrash
him
.
In
the
cabin
he
lay
on
the
*NL*
floor
near
the
stove
,
without
interest
in
food
,
in
Matt
,
nor
in
life
.
*NL*
Matt
might
talk
gently
to
him
or
swear
at
him
,
it
was
all
the
same
;
he
*NL*
never
did
more
than
turn
his
dull
eyes
upon
the
man
,
then
drop
his
head
*NL*
back
to
its
customary
position
on
his
fore-paws
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
one
night
,
Matt
,
reading
to
himself
with
moving
lips
and
*NL*
mumbled
sounds
,
was
startled
by
a
low
whine
from
White
Fang
.
He
had
got
*NL*
upon
his
feet
,
his
ears
cocked
towards
the
door
,
and
he
was
listening
*NL*
intently
.
A
moment
later
,
Matt
heard
a
footstep
.
The
door
opened
,
and
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
stepped
in
.
The
two
men
shook
hands
.
Then
Scott
looked
*NL*
around
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
wolf
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
discovered
him
,
standing
where
he
had
been
lying
,
near
to
the
*NL*
stove
.
He
had
not
rushed
forward
after
the
manner
of
other
dogs
.
He
*NL*
stood
,
watching
and
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holy
smoke
!
''
Matt
exclaimed
.
``
Look
at
'm
wag
his
tail
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
strode
half
across
the
room
toward
him
,
at
the
same
time
*NL*
calling
him
.
White
Fang
came
to
him
,
not
with
a
great
bound
,
yet
*NL*
quickly
.
He
was
awakened
from
self-consciousness
,
but
as
he
drew
near
,
*NL*
his
eyes
took
on
a
strange
expression
.
Something
,
an
incommunicable
*NL*
vastness
of
feeling
,
rose
up
into
his
eyes
as
a
light
and
shone
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
looked
at
me
that
way
all
the
time
you
was
gone
!
''
Matt
*NL*
commented
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
did
not
hear
.
He
was
squatting
down
on
his
heels
,
face
to
*NL*
face
with
White
Fang
and
petting
him
--
rubbing
at
the
roots
of
the
ears
,
*NL*
making
long
caressing
strokes
down
the
neck
to
the
shoulders
,
tapping
the
*NL*
spine
gently
with
the
balls
of
his
fingers
.
And
White
Fang
was
growling
*NL*
responsively
,
the
crooning
note
of
the
growl
more
pronounced
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
was
not
all
.
What
of
his
joy
,
the
great
love
in
him
,
ever
*NL*
surging
and
struggling
to
express
itself
,
succeeded
in
finding
a
new
*NL*
mode
of
expression
.
He
suddenly
thrust
his
head
forward
and
nudged
his
*NL*
way
in
between
the
master
's
arm
and
body
.
And
here
,
confined
,
hidden
*NL*
from
view
all
except
his
ears
,
no
longer
growling
,
he
continued
to
nudge
*NL*
and
snuggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
looked
at
each
other
.
Scott
's
eyes
were
shining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh
!
''
said
Matt
in
an
awe-stricken
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
when
he
had
recovered
himself
,
he
said
,
``
I
always
*NL*
insisted
that
wolf
was
a
dog
.
Look
at
'm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
return
of
the
love-master
,
White
Fang
's
recovery
was
rapid
.
Two
*NL*
nights
and
a
day
he
spent
in
the
cabin
.
Then
he
sallied
forth
.
The
sled
-
*NL*
dogs
had
forgotten
his
prowess
.
They
remembered
only
the
latest
,
which
*NL*
was
his
weakness
and
sickness
.
At
the
sight
of
him
as
he
came
out
of
the
*NL*
cabin
,
they
sprang
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
about
your
rough-houses
,
''
Matt
murmured
gleefully
,
standing
in
the
*NL*
doorway
and
looking
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
'm
hell
,
you
wolf
!
Give
'm
hell
!
--
an
'
then
some
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
did
not
need
the
encouragement
.
The
return
of
the
love-master
*NL*
was
enough
.
Life
was
flowing
through
him
again
,
splendid
and
*NL*
indomitable
.
He
fought
from
sheer
joy
,
finding
in
it
an
expression
of
*NL*
much
that
he
felt
and
that
otherwise
was
without
speech
.
There
could
be
*NL*
but
one
ending
.
The
team
dispersed
in
ignominious
defeat
,
and
it
was
not
*NL*
until
after
dark
that
the
dogs
came
sneaking
back
,
one
by
one
,
by
*NL*
meekness
and
humility
signifying
their
fealty
to
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
learned
to
snuggle
,
White
Fang
was
guilty
of
it
often
.
It
was
the
*NL*
final
word
.
He
could
not
go
beyond
it
.
The
one
thing
of
which
he
had
*NL*
always
been
particularly
jealous
was
his
head
.
He
had
always
disliked
to
*NL*
have
it
touched
.
It
was
the
Wild
in
him
,
the
fear
of
hurt
and
of
the
*NL*
trap
,
that
had
given
rise
to
the
panicky
impulses
to
avoid
contacts
.
It
*NL*
was
the
mandate
of
his
instinct
that
that
head
must
be
free
.
And
now
,
*NL*
with
the
love-master
,
his
snuggling
was
the
deliberate
act
of
putting
*NL*
himself
into
a
position
of
hopeless
helplessness
.
It
was
an
expression
*NL*
of
perfect
confidence
,
of
absolute
self-surrender
,
as
though
he
said
:
``
I
*NL*
put
myself
into
thy
hands
.
Work
thou
thy
will
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
not
long
after
the
return
,
Scott
and
Matt
sat
at
a
game
of
*NL*
cribbage
preliminary
to
going
to
bed
.
``
Fifteen-two
,
fifteen-four
an
'
a
*NL*
pair
makes
six
,
''
Matt
was
pegging
up
,
when
there
was
an
outcry
and
sound
*NL*
of
snarling
without
.
They
looked
at
each
other
as
they
started
to
rise
*NL*
to
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wolf
's
nailed
somebody
,
''
Matt
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
wild
scream
of
fear
and
anguish
hastened
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
a
light
!
''
Scott
shouted
,
as
he
sprang
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
followed
with
the
lamp
,
and
by
its
light
they
saw
a
man
lying
on
his
*NL*
back
in
the
snow
.
His
arms
were
folded
,
one
above
the
other
,
across
his
*NL*
face
and
throat
.
Thus
he
was
trying
to
shield
himself
from
White
Fang
's
*NL*
teeth
.
And
there
was
need
for
it
.
White
Fang
was
in
a
rage
,
wickedly
*NL*
making
his
attack
on
the
most
vulnerable
spot
.
From
shoulder
to
wrist
of
*NL*
the
crossed
arms
,
the
coat-sleeve
,
blue
flannel
shirt
and
undershirt
were
*NL*
ripped
in
rags
,
while
the
arms
themselves
were
terribly
slashed
and
*NL*
streaming
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
the
two
men
saw
in
the
first
instant
.
The
next
instant
Weedon
*NL*
Scott
had
White
Fang
by
the
throat
and
was
dragging
him
clear
.
White
*NL*
Fang
struggled
and
snarled
,
but
made
no
attempt
to
bite
,
while
he
quickly
*NL*
quieted
down
at
a
sharp
word
from
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
helped
the
man
to
his
feet
.
As
he
arose
he
lowered
his
crossed
*NL*
arms
,
exposing
the
bestial
face
of
Beauty
Smith
.
The
dog-musher
let
go
*NL*
of
him
precipitately
,
with
action
similar
to
that
of
a
man
who
has
picked
*NL*
up
live
fire
.
Beauty
Smith
blinked
in
the
lamplight
and
looked
about
*NL*
him
.
He
caught
sight
of
White
Fang
and
terror
rushed
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
Matt
noticed
two
objects
lying
in
the
snow
.
He
held
*NL*
the
lamp
close
to
them
,
indicating
them
with
his
toe
for
his
employer
's
*NL*
benefit
--
a
steel
dog-chain
and
a
stout
club
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
saw
and
nodded
.
Not
a
word
was
spoken
.
The
dog-musher
laid
*NL*
his
hand
on
Beauty
Smith
's
shoulder
and
faced
him
to
the
right
about
.
No
*NL*
word
needed
to
be
spoken
.
Beauty
Smith
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
love-master
was
patting
White
Fang
and
talking
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tried
to
steal
you
,
eh
?
And
you
would
n't
have
it
!
Well
,
well
,
he
made
*NL*
a
mistake
,
did
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
`
a
'
thought
he
had
hold
of
seventeen
devils
,
''
the
dog-musher
*NL*
sniggered
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
,
still
wrought
up
and
bristling
,
growled
and
growled
,
the
hair
*NL*
slowly
lying
down
,
the
crooning
note
remote
and
dim
,
but
growing
in
his
*NL*
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
PART
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
--
THE
LONG
TRAIL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
air
.
White
Fang
sensed
the
coming
calamity
,
even
before
*NL*
there
was
tangible
evidence
of
it
.
In
vague
ways
it
was
borne
in
upon
*NL*
him
that
a
change
was
impending
.
He
knew
not
how
nor
why
,
yet
he
got
his
*NL*
feel
of
the
oncoming
event
from
the
gods
themselves
.
In
ways
subtler
*NL*
than
they
knew
,
they
betrayed
their
intentions
to
the
wolf-dog
that
*NL*
haunted
the
cabin-stoop
,
and
that
,
though
he
never
came
inside
the
cabin
,
*NL*
knew
what
went
on
inside
their
brains
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
that
,
will
you
!
''
the
dog-musher
exclaimed
at
supper
one
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
listened
.
Through
the
door
came
a
low
,
anxious
whine
,
like
*NL*
a
sobbing
under
the
breath
that
had
just
grown
audible
.
Then
came
the
*NL*
long
sniff
,
as
White
Fang
reassured
himself
that
his
god
was
still
inside
*NL*
and
had
not
yet
taken
himself
off
in
mysterious
and
solitary
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
believe
that
wolf
's
on
to
you
,
''
the
dog-musher
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
looked
across
at
his
companion
with
eyes
that
almost
*NL*
pleaded
,
though
this
was
given
the
lie
by
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
can
I
do
with
a
wolf
in
California
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
say
,
''
Matt
answered
.
``
What
the
devil
can
you
do
with
a
*NL*
wolf
in
California
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
did
not
satisfy
Weedon
Scott
.
The
other
seemed
to
be
judging
*NL*
him
in
a
non-committal
sort
of
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
White
man
's
dogs
would
have
no
show
against
him
,
''
Scott
went
on
.
``
He
'd
*NL*
kill
them
on
sight
.
If
he
did
n't
bankrupt
me
with
damage
suits
,
the
*NL*
authorities
would
take
him
away
from
me
and
electrocute
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
downright
murderer
,
I
know
,
''
was
the
dog-musher
's
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
looked
at
him
suspiciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
never
do
,
''
he
said
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
never
do
!
''
Matt
concurred
.
``
Why
you
'd
have
to
hire
a
man
*NL*
`
specially
to
take
care
of
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
's
suspicion
was
allayed
.
He
nodded
cheerfully
.
In
the
silence
*NL*
that
followed
,
the
low
,
half-sobbing
whine
was
heard
at
the
door
and
then
*NL*
the
long
,
questing
sniff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
denyin
'
he
thinks
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
you
,
''
Matt
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
glared
at
him
in
sudden
wrath
.
``
Damn
it
all
,
man
!
I
know
my
*NL*
own
mind
and
what
's
best
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
agreein
'
with
you
,
only
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
what
?
''
Scott
snapped
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
...
''
the
dog-musher
began
softly
,
then
changed
his
mind
and
*NL*
betrayed
a
rising
anger
of
his
own
.
``
Well
,
you
need
n't
get
so
all-fired
*NL*
het
up
about
it
.
Judgin
'
by
your
actions
one
'd
think
you
did
n't
know
*NL*
your
own
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
debated
with
himself
for
a
while
,
and
then
said
more
gently
:
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Matt
.
I
do
n't
know
my
own
mind
,
and
that
's
what
's
the
*NL*
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
would
be
rank
ridiculousness
for
me
to
take
that
dog
along
,
''
he
*NL*
broke
out
after
another
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
agreein
'
with
you
,
''
was
Matt
's
answer
,
and
again
his
employer
was
*NL*
not
quite
satisfied
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
in
the
name
of
the
great
Sardanapolis
he
knows
you
're
goin
'
is
*NL*
what
gets
me
,
''
the
dog-musher
continued
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
beyond
me
,
Matt
,
''
Scott
answered
,
with
a
mournful
shake
of
the
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
day
when
,
through
the
open
cabin
door
,
White
Fang
saw
the
*NL*
fatal
grip
on
the
floor
and
the
love-master
packing
things
into
it
.
Also
,
*NL*
there
were
comings
and
goings
,
and
the
erstwhile
placid
atmosphere
of
the
*NL*
cabin
was
vexed
with
strange
perturbations
and
unrest
.
Here
was
*NL*
indubitable
evidence
.
White
Fang
had
already
scented
it
.
He
now
*NL*
reasoned
it
.
His
god
was
preparing
for
another
flight
.
And
since
he
had
*NL*
not
taken
him
with
him
before
,
so
,
now
,
he
could
look
to
be
left
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
he
lifted
the
long
wolf-howl
.
As
he
had
howled
,
in
his
puppy
*NL*
days
,
when
he
fled
back
from
the
Wild
to
the
village
to
find
it
vanished
*NL*
and
naught
but
a
rubbish-heap
to
mark
the
site
of
Grey
Beaver
's
tepee
,
so
*NL*
now
he
pointed
his
muzzle
to
the
cold
stars
and
told
to
them
his
woe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Inside
the
cabin
the
two
men
had
just
gone
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
gone
off
his
food
again
,
''
Matt
remarked
from
his
bunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
grunt
from
Weedon
Scott
's
bunk
,
and
a
stir
of
blankets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
way
he
cut
up
the
other
time
you
went
away
,
I
would
n't
wonder
*NL*
this
time
but
what
he
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blankets
in
the
other
bunk
stirred
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shut
up
!
''
Scott
cried
out
through
the
darkness
.
``
You
nag
worse
than
*NL*
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
agreein
'
with
you
,
''
the
dog-musher
answered
,
and
Weedon
Scott
was
*NL*
not
quite
sure
whether
or
not
the
other
had
snickered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
White
Fang
's
anxiety
and
restlessness
were
even
more
*NL*
pronounced
.
He
dogged
his
master
's
heels
whenever
he
left
the
cabin
,
and
*NL*
haunted
the
front
stoop
when
he
remained
inside
.
Through
the
open
door
*NL*
he
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
luggage
on
the
floor
.
The
grip
had
been
*NL*
joined
by
two
large
canvas
bags
and
a
box
.
Matt
was
rolling
the
master
's
*NL*
blankets
and
fur
robe
inside
a
small
tarpaulin
.
White
Fang
whined
as
he
*NL*
watched
the
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
two
Indians
arrived
.
He
watched
them
closely
as
they
shouldered
*NL*
the
luggage
and
were
led
off
down
the
hill
by
Matt
,
who
carried
the
*NL*
bedding
and
the
grip
.
But
White
Fang
did
not
follow
them
.
The
master
*NL*
was
still
in
the
cabin
.
After
a
time
,
Matt
returned
.
The
master
came
to
*NL*
the
door
and
called
White
Fang
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
poor
devil
,
''
he
said
gently
,
rubbing
White
Fang
's
ears
and
tapping
*NL*
his
spine
.
``
I
'm
hitting
the
long
trail
,
old
man
,
where
you
can
not
*NL*
follow
.
Now
give
me
a
growl
--
the
last
,
good
,
good-bye
growl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
White
Fang
refused
to
growl
.
Instead
,
and
after
a
wistful
,
searching
*NL*
look
,
he
snuggled
in
,
burrowing
his
head
out
of
sight
between
the
*NL*
master
's
arm
and
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
she
blows
!
''
Matt
cried
.
From
the
Yukon
arose
the
hoarse
bellowing
*NL*
of
a
river
steamboat
.
``
You
've
got
to
cut
it
short
.
Be
sure
and
lock
the
*NL*
front
door
.
I
'll
go
out
the
back
.
Get
a
move
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
doors
slammed
at
the
same
moment
,
and
Weedon
Scott
waited
for
*NL*
Matt
to
come
around
to
the
front
.
From
inside
the
door
came
a
low
*NL*
whining
and
sobbing
.
Then
there
were
long
,
deep-drawn
sniffs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
take
good
care
of
him
,
Matt
,
''
Scott
said
,
as
they
started
down
*NL*
the
hill
.
``
Write
and
let
me
know
how
he
gets
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
the
dog-musher
answered
.
``
But
listen
to
that
,
will
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
men
stopped
.
White
Fang
was
howling
as
dogs
howl
when
their
masters
*NL*
lie
dead
.
He
was
voicing
an
utter
woe
,
his
cry
bursting
upward
in
great
*NL*
heart-breaking
rushes
,
dying
down
into
quavering
misery
,
and
bursting
*NL*
upward
again
with
a
rush
upon
rush
of
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
_
Aurora
_
was
the
first
steamboat
of
the
year
for
the
Outside
,
and
her
*NL*
decks
were
jammed
with
prosperous
adventurers
and
broken
gold
seekers
,
*NL*
all
equally
as
mad
to
get
to
the
Outside
as
they
had
been
originally
to
*NL*
get
to
the
Inside
.
Near
the
gang-plank
,
Scott
was
shaking
hands
with
*NL*
Matt
,
who
was
preparing
to
go
ashore
.
But
Matt
's
hand
went
limp
in
the
*NL*
other
's
grasp
as
his
gaze
shot
past
and
remained
fixed
on
something
*NL*
behind
him
.
Scott
turned
to
see
.
Sitting
on
the
deck
several
feet
away
*NL*
and
watching
wistfully
was
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog-musher
swore
softly
,
in
awe-stricken
accents
.
Scott
could
only
*NL*
look
in
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
lock
the
front
door
?
''
Matt
demanded
.
The
other
nodded
,
and
*NL*
asked
,
``
How
about
the
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
just
bet
I
did
,
''
was
the
fervent
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
flattened
his
ears
ingratiatingly
,
but
remained
where
he
was
,
*NL*
making
no
attempt
to
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
to
take
'm
ashore
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
made
a
couple
of
steps
toward
White
Fang
,
but
the
latter
slid
away
*NL*
from
him
.
The
dog-musher
made
a
rush
of
it
,
and
White
Fang
dodged
*NL*
between
the
legs
of
a
group
of
men
.
Ducking
,
turning
,
doubling
,
he
slid
*NL*
about
the
deck
,
eluding
the
other
's
efforts
to
capture
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
love-master
spoke
,
White
Fang
came
to
him
with
prompt
*NL*
obedience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
come
to
the
hand
that
's
fed
'm
all
these
months
,
''
the
dog-musher
*NL*
muttered
resentfully
.
``
And
you
--
you
ai
n't
never
fed
'm
after
them
first
*NL*
days
of
gettin
'
acquainted
.
I
'm
blamed
if
I
can
see
how
he
works
it
out
*NL*
that
you
're
the
boss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scott
,
who
had
been
patting
White
Fang
,
suddenly
bent
closer
and
pointed
*NL*
out
fresh-made
cuts
on
his
muzzle
,
and
a
gash
between
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
bent
over
and
passed
his
hand
along
White
Fang
's
belly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
plumb
forgot
the
window
.
He
's
all
cut
an
'
gouged
underneath
.
Must
*NL*
`
a
'
butted
clean
through
it
,
b
`
gosh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Weedon
Scott
was
not
listening
.
He
was
thinking
rapidly
.
The
*NL*
_
Aurora
's
_
whistle
hooted
a
final
announcement
of
departure
.
Men
were
*NL*
scurrying
down
the
gang-plank
to
the
shore
.
Matt
loosened
the
bandana
*NL*
from
his
own
neck
and
started
to
put
it
around
White
Fang
's
.
Scott
*NL*
grasped
the
dog-musher
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Matt
,
old
man
.
About
the
wolf
--
you
need
n't
write
.
You
see
,
*NL*
I
've
...
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
the
dog-musher
exploded
.
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
thing
I
mean
.
Here
's
your
bandana
.
I
'll
write
to
you
about
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matt
paused
halfway
down
the
gang-plank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
never
stand
the
climate
!
''
he
shouted
back
.
``
Unless
you
clip
'm
in
*NL*
warm
weather
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gang-plank
was
hauled
in
,
and
the
_
Aurora
_
swung
out
from
the
bank
.
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
waved
a
last
good-bye
.
Then
he
turned
and
bent
over
White
*NL*
Fang
,
standing
by
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
growl
,
damn
you
,
growl
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
patted
the
responsive
head
*NL*
and
rubbed
the
flattening
ears
.

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
SOUTHLAND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
landed
from
the
steamer
in
San
Francisco
.
He
was
appalled
.
*NL*
Deep
in
him
,
below
any
reasoning
process
or
act
of
consciousness
,
he
had
*NL*
associated
power
with
godhead
.
And
never
had
the
white
men
seemed
such
*NL*
marvellous
gods
as
now
,
when
he
trod
the
slimy
pavement
of
San
Francisco
.
*NL*
The
log
cabins
he
had
known
were
replaced
by
towering
buildings
.
The
*NL*
streets
were
crowded
with
perils
--
waggons
,
carts
,
automobiles
;
great
,
*NL*
straining
horses
pulling
huge
trucks
;
and
monstrous
cable
and
electric
*NL*
cars
hooting
and
clanging
through
the
midst
,
screeching
their
insistent
*NL*
menace
after
the
manner
of
the
lynxes
he
had
known
in
the
northern
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
the
manifestation
of
power
.
Through
it
all
,
behind
it
all
,
*NL*
was
man
,
governing
and
controlling
,
expressing
himself
,
as
of
old
,
by
his
*NL*
mastery
over
matter
.
It
was
colossal
,
stunning
.
White
Fang
was
awed
.
*NL*
Fear
sat
upon
him
.
As
in
his
cubhood
he
had
been
made
to
feel
his
*NL*
smallness
and
puniness
on
the
day
he
first
came
in
from
the
Wild
to
the
*NL*
village
of
Grey
Beaver
,
so
now
,
in
his
full-grown
stature
and
pride
of
*NL*
strength
,
he
was
made
to
feel
small
and
puny
.
And
there
were
so
many
*NL*
gods
!
He
was
made
dizzy
by
the
swarming
of
them
.
The
thunder
of
the
*NL*
streets
smote
upon
his
ears
.
He
was
bewildered
by
the
tremendous
and
*NL*
endless
rush
and
movement
of
things
.
As
never
before
,
he
felt
his
*NL*
dependence
on
the
love-master
,
close
at
whose
heels
he
followed
,
no
*NL*
matter
what
happened
never
losing
sight
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
White
Fang
was
to
have
no
more
than
a
nightmare
vision
of
the
city
--
an
*NL*
experience
that
was
like
a
bad
dream
,
unreal
and
terrible
,
that
haunted
*NL*
him
for
long
after
in
his
dreams
.
He
was
put
into
a
baggage-car
by
the
*NL*
master
,
chained
in
a
corner
in
the
midst
of
heaped
trunks
and
valises
.
*NL*
Here
a
squat
and
brawny
god
held
sway
,
with
much
noise
,
hurling
trunks
*NL*
and
boxes
about
,
dragging
them
in
through
the
door
and
tossing
them
into
*NL*
the
piles
,
or
flinging
them
out
of
the
door
,
smashing
and
crashing
,
to
*NL*
other
gods
who
awaited
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
,
in
this
inferno
of
luggage
,
was
White
Fang
deserted
by
the
*NL*
master
.
Or
at
least
White
Fang
thought
he
was
deserted
,
until
he
smelled
*NL*
out
the
master
's
canvas
clothes-bags
alongside
of
him
,
and
proceeded
to
*NL*
mount
guard
over
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Bout
time
you
come
,
''
growled
the
god
of
the
car
,
an
hour
later
,
when
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
appeared
at
the
door
.
``
That
dog
of
yourn
wo
n't
let
me
lay
a
*NL*
finger
on
your
stuff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
emerged
from
the
car
.
He
was
astonished
.
The
nightmare
city
*NL*
was
gone
.
The
car
had
been
to
him
no
more
than
a
room
in
a
house
,
and
*NL*
when
he
had
entered
it
the
city
had
been
all
around
him
.
In
the
interval
*NL*
the
city
had
disappeared
.
The
roar
of
it
no
longer
dinned
upon
his
ears
.
*NL*
Before
him
was
smiling
country
,
streaming
with
sunshine
,
lazy
with
*NL*
quietude
.
But
he
had
little
time
to
marvel
at
the
transformation
.
He
*NL*
accepted
it
as
he
accepted
all
the
unaccountable
doings
and
*NL*
manifestations
of
the
gods
.
It
was
their
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
carriage
waiting
.
A
man
and
a
woman
approached
the
master
.
*NL*
The
woman
's
arms
went
out
and
clutched
the
master
around
the
neck
--
a
*NL*
hostile
act
!
The
next
moment
Weedon
Scott
had
torn
loose
from
the
*NL*
embrace
and
closed
with
White
Fang
,
who
had
become
a
snarling
,
raging
*NL*
demon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
mother
,
''
Scott
was
saying
as
he
kept
tight
hold
of
White
*NL*
Fang
and
placated
him
.
``
He
thought
you
were
going
to
injure
me
,
and
he
*NL*
would
n't
stand
for
it
.
It
's
all
right
.
It
's
all
right
.
He
'll
learn
*NL*
soon
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
the
meantime
I
may
be
permitted
to
love
my
son
when
his
dog
is
*NL*
not
around
,
''
she
laughed
,
though
she
was
pale
and
weak
from
the
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
White
Fang
,
who
snarled
and
bristled
and
glared
*NL*
malevolently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
have
to
learn
,
and
he
shall
,
without
postponement
,
''
Scott
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
softly
to
White
Fang
until
he
had
quieted
him
,
then
his
voice
*NL*
became
firm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
,
sir
!
Down
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
been
one
of
the
things
taught
him
by
the
master
,
and
White
Fang
*NL*
obeyed
,
though
he
lay
down
reluctantly
and
sullenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scott
opened
his
arms
to
her
,
but
kept
his
eyes
on
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
!
''
he
warned
.
``
Down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
,
bristling
silently
,
half-crouching
as
he
rose
,
sank
back
and
*NL*
watched
the
hostile
act
repeated
.
But
no
harm
came
of
it
,
nor
of
the
*NL*
embrace
from
the
strange
man-god
that
followed
.
Then
the
clothes-bags
*NL*
were
taken
into
the
carriage
,
the
strange
gods
and
the
love-master
*NL*
followed
,
and
White
Fang
pursued
,
now
running
vigilantly
behind
,
now
*NL*
bristling
up
to
the
running
horses
and
warning
them
that
he
was
there
to
*NL*
see
that
no
harm
befell
the
god
they
dragged
so
swiftly
across
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
fifteen
minutes
,
the
carriage
swung
in
through
a
stone
*NL*
gateway
and
on
between
a
double
row
of
arched
and
interlacing
walnut
*NL*
trees
.
On
either
side
stretched
lawns
,
their
broad
sweep
broken
here
and
*NL*
there
by
great
sturdy-limbed
oaks
.
In
the
near
distance
,
in
contrast
*NL*
with
the
young-green
of
the
tended
grass
,
sunburnt
hay-fields
showed
tan
*NL*
and
gold
;
while
beyond
were
the
tawny
hills
and
upland
pastures
.
From
*NL*
the
head
of
the
lawn
,
on
the
first
soft
swell
from
the
valley-level
,
*NL*
looked
down
the
deep-porched
,
many-windowed
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
opportunity
was
given
White
Fang
to
see
all
this
.
Hardly
had
the
*NL*
carriage
entered
the
grounds
,
when
he
was
set
upon
by
a
sheep-dog
,
bright
-
*NL*
eyed
,
sharp-muzzled
,
righteously
indignant
and
angry
.
It
was
between
him
*NL*
and
the
master
,
cutting
him
off
.
White
Fang
snarled
no
warning
,
but
his
*NL*
hair
bristled
as
he
made
his
silent
and
deadly
rush
.
This
rush
was
never
*NL*
completed
.
He
halted
with
awkward
abruptness
,
with
stiff
fore-legs
*NL*
bracing
himself
against
his
momentum
,
almost
sitting
down
on
his
*NL*
haunches
,
so
desirous
was
he
of
avoiding
contact
with
the
dog
he
was
in
*NL*
the
act
of
attacking
.
It
was
a
female
,
and
the
law
of
his
kind
thrust
a
*NL*
barrier
between
.
For
him
to
attack
her
would
require
nothing
less
than
a
*NL*
violation
of
his
instinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
with
the
sheep-dog
it
was
otherwise
.
Being
a
female
,
she
possessed
*NL*
no
such
instinct
.
On
the
other
hand
,
being
a
sheep-dog
,
her
instinctive
*NL*
fear
of
the
Wild
,
and
especially
of
the
wolf
,
was
unusually
keen
.
White
*NL*
Fang
was
to
her
a
wolf
,
the
hereditary
marauder
who
had
preyed
upon
her
*NL*
flocks
from
the
time
sheep
were
first
herded
and
guarded
by
some
dim
*NL*
ancestor
of
hers
.
And
so
,
as
he
abandoned
his
rush
at
her
and
braced
*NL*
himself
to
avoid
the
contact
,
she
sprang
upon
him
.
He
snarled
*NL*
involuntarily
as
he
felt
her
teeth
in
his
shoulder
,
but
beyond
this
made
*NL*
no
offer
to
hurt
her
.
He
backed
away
,
stiff-legged
with
*NL*
self-consciousness
,
and
tried
to
go
around
her
.
He
dodged
this
way
and
*NL*
that
,
and
curved
and
turned
,
but
to
no
purpose
.
She
remained
always
*NL*
between
him
and
the
way
he
wanted
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Collie
!
''
called
the
strange
man
in
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
father
.
It
is
good
discipline
.
White
Fang
will
have
to
*NL*
learn
many
things
,
and
it
's
just
as
well
that
he
begins
now
.
He
'll
*NL*
adjust
himself
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
drove
on
,
and
still
Collie
blocked
White
Fang
's
way
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
outrun
her
by
leaving
the
drive
and
circling
across
the
lawn
but
*NL*
she
ran
on
the
inner
and
smaller
circle
,
and
was
always
there
,
facing
him
*NL*
with
her
two
rows
of
gleaming
teeth
.
Back
he
circled
,
across
the
drive
*NL*
to
the
other
lawn
,
and
again
she
headed
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
was
bearing
the
master
away
.
White
Fang
caught
glimpses
of
*NL*
it
disappearing
amongst
the
trees
.
The
situation
was
desperate
.
He
*NL*
essayed
another
circle
.
She
followed
,
running
swiftly
.
And
then
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
he
turned
upon
her
.
It
was
his
old
fighting
trick
.
Shoulder
*NL*
to
shoulder
,
he
struck
her
squarely
.
Not
only
was
she
overthrown
.
So
*NL*
fast
had
she
been
running
that
she
rolled
along
,
now
on
her
back
,
now
on
*NL*
her
side
,
as
she
struggled
to
stop
,
clawing
gravel
with
her
feet
and
*NL*
crying
shrilly
her
hurt
pride
and
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
did
not
wait
.
The
way
was
clear
,
and
that
was
all
he
had
*NL*
wanted
.
She
took
after
him
,
never
ceasing
her
outcry
.
It
was
the
*NL*
straightaway
now
,
and
when
it
came
to
real
running
,
White
Fang
could
*NL*
teach
her
things
.
She
ran
frantically
,
hysterically
,
straining
to
the
*NL*
utmost
,
advertising
the
effort
she
was
making
with
every
leap
:
and
all
*NL*
the
time
White
Fang
slid
smoothly
away
from
her
silently
,
without
effort
,
*NL*
gliding
like
a
ghost
over
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
rounded
the
house
to
the
_
porte-cochere
_
,
he
came
upon
the
*NL*
carriage
.
It
had
stopped
,
and
the
master
was
alighting
.
At
this
moment
,
*NL*
still
running
at
top
speed
,
White
Fang
became
suddenly
aware
of
an
attack
*NL*
from
the
side
.
It
was
a
deer-hound
rushing
upon
him
.
White
Fang
tried
*NL*
to
face
it
.
But
he
was
going
too
fast
,
and
the
hound
was
too
close
.
It
*NL*
struck
him
on
the
side
;
and
such
was
his
forward
momentum
and
the
*NL*
unexpectedness
of
it
,
White
Fang
was
hurled
to
the
ground
and
rolled
*NL*
clear
over
.
He
came
out
of
the
tangle
a
spectacle
of
malignancy
,
ears
*NL*
flattened
back
,
lips
writhing
,
nose
wrinkling
,
his
teeth
clipping
*NL*
together
as
the
fangs
barely
missed
the
hound
's
soft
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
was
running
up
,
but
was
too
far
away
;
and
it
was
Collie
that
*NL*
saved
the
hound
's
life
.
Before
White
Fang
could
spring
in
and
deliver
*NL*
the
fatal
stroke
,
and
just
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
springing
in
,
Collie
*NL*
arrived
.
She
had
been
out-manoeuvred
and
out-run
,
to
say
nothing
of
her
*NL*
having
been
unceremoniously
tumbled
in
the
gravel
,
and
her
arrival
was
*NL*
like
that
of
a
tornado
--
made
up
of
offended
dignity
,
justifiable
wrath
,
*NL*
and
instinctive
hatred
for
this
marauder
from
the
Wild
.
She
struck
White
*NL*
Fang
at
right
angles
in
the
midst
of
his
spring
,
and
again
he
was
knocked
*NL*
off
his
feet
and
rolled
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
moment
the
master
arrived
,
and
with
one
hand
held
White
Fang
,
*NL*
while
the
father
called
off
the
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
this
is
a
pretty
warm
reception
for
a
poor
lone
wolf
from
the
*NL*
Arctic
,
''
the
master
said
,
while
White
Fang
calmed
down
under
his
*NL*
caressing
hand
.
``
In
all
his
life
he
's
only
been
known
once
to
go
off
his
*NL*
feet
,
and
here
he
's
been
rolled
twice
in
thirty
seconds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
had
driven
away
,
and
other
strange
gods
had
appeared
from
*NL*
out
the
house
.
Some
of
these
stood
respectfully
at
a
distance
;
but
two
*NL*
of
them
,
women
,
perpetrated
the
hostile
act
of
clutching
the
master
*NL*
around
the
neck
.
White
Fang
,
however
,
was
beginning
to
tolerate
this
*NL*
act
.
No
harm
seemed
to
come
of
it
,
while
the
noises
the
gods
made
were
*NL*
certainly
not
threatening
.
These
gods
also
made
overtures
to
White
Fang
,
*NL*
but
he
warned
them
off
with
a
snarl
,
and
the
master
did
likewise
with
*NL*
word
of
mouth
.
At
such
times
White
Fang
leaned
in
close
against
the
*NL*
master
's
legs
and
received
reassuring
pats
on
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hound
,
under
the
command
,
``
Dick
!
Lie
down
,
sir
!
''
had
gone
up
the
*NL*
steps
and
lain
down
to
one
side
of
the
porch
,
still
growling
and
keeping
*NL*
a
sullen
watch
on
the
intruder
.
Collie
had
been
taken
in
charge
by
one
*NL*
of
the
woman-gods
,
who
held
arms
around
her
neck
and
petted
and
caressed
*NL*
her
;
but
Collie
was
very
much
perplexed
and
worried
,
whining
and
*NL*
restless
,
outraged
by
the
permitted
presence
of
this
wolf
and
confident
*NL*
that
the
gods
were
making
a
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
gods
started
up
the
steps
to
enter
the
house
.
White
Fang
*NL*
followed
closely
at
the
master
's
heels
.
Dick
,
on
the
porch
,
growled
,
and
*NL*
White
Fang
,
on
the
steps
,
bristled
and
growled
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
Collie
inside
and
leave
the
two
of
them
to
fight
it
out
,
''
suggested
*NL*
Scott
's
father
.
``
After
that
they
'll
be
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
White
Fang
,
to
show
his
friendship
,
will
have
to
be
chief
mourner
*NL*
at
the
funeral
,
''
laughed
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
Scott
looked
incredulously
,
first
at
White
Fang
,
then
at
Dick
,
*NL*
and
finally
at
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
nodded
his
head
.
``
I
mean
just
that
.
You
'd
have
a
dead
Dick
*NL*
inside
one
minute
--
two
minutes
at
the
farthest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
White
Fang
.
``
Come
on
,
you
wolf
.
It
's
you
that
'll
have
to
*NL*
come
inside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
walked
stiff-legged
up
the
steps
and
across
the
porch
,
with
*NL*
tail
rigidly
erect
,
keeping
his
eyes
on
Dick
to
guard
against
a
flank
*NL*
attack
,
and
at
the
same
time
prepared
for
whatever
fierce
manifestation
*NL*
of
the
unknown
that
might
pounce
out
upon
him
from
the
interior
of
the
*NL*
house
.
But
no
thing
of
fear
pounced
out
,
and
when
he
had
gained
the
*NL*
inside
he
scouted
carefully
around
,
looking
at
it
and
finding
it
not
.
*NL*
Then
he
lay
down
with
a
contented
grunt
at
the
master
's
feet
,
observing
*NL*
all
that
went
on
,
ever
ready
to
spring
to
his
feet
and
fight
for
life
*NL*
with
the
terrors
he
felt
must
lurk
under
the
trap-roof
of
the
dwelling
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
GOD
'S
DOMAIN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
was
White
Fang
adaptable
by
nature
,
but
he
had
travelled
much
,
*NL*
and
knew
the
meaning
and
necessity
of
adjustment
.
Here
,
in
Sierra
Vista
,
*NL*
which
was
the
name
of
Judge
Scott
's
place
,
White
Fang
quickly
began
to
*NL*
make
himself
at
home
.
He
had
no
further
serious
trouble
with
the
dogs
.
*NL*
They
knew
more
about
the
ways
of
the
Southland
gods
than
did
he
,
and
in
*NL*
their
eyes
he
had
qualified
when
he
accompanied
the
gods
inside
the
*NL*
house
.
Wolf
that
he
was
,
and
unprecedented
as
it
was
,
the
gods
had
*NL*
sanctioned
his
presence
,
and
they
,
the
dogs
of
the
gods
,
could
only
*NL*
recognise
this
sanction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dick
,
perforce
,
had
to
go
through
a
few
stiff
formalities
at
first
,
after
*NL*
which
he
calmly
accepted
White
Fang
as
an
addition
to
the
premises
.
Had
*NL*
Dick
had
his
way
,
they
would
have
been
good
friends
;
but
White
Fang
*NL*
was
averse
to
friendship
.
All
he
asked
of
other
dogs
was
to
be
let
*NL*
alone
.
His
whole
life
he
had
kept
aloof
from
his
kind
,
and
he
still
*NL*
desired
to
keep
aloof
.
Dick
's
overtures
bothered
him
,
so
he
snarled
Dick
*NL*
away
.
In
the
north
he
had
learned
the
lesson
that
he
must
let
the
*NL*
master
's
dogs
alone
,
and
he
did
not
forget
that
lesson
now
.
But
he
*NL*
insisted
on
his
own
privacy
and
self-seclusion
,
and
so
thoroughly
ignored
*NL*
Dick
that
that
good-natured
creature
finally
gave
him
up
and
scarcely
*NL*
took
as
much
interest
in
him
as
in
the
hitching-post
near
the
stable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
so
with
Collie
.
While
she
accepted
him
because
it
was
the
mandate
of
*NL*
the
gods
,
that
was
no
reason
that
she
should
leave
him
in
peace
.
Woven
*NL*
into
her
being
was
the
memory
of
countless
crimes
he
and
his
had
*NL*
perpetrated
against
her
ancestry
.
Not
in
a
day
nor
a
generation
were
the
*NL*
ravaged
sheepfolds
to
be
forgotten
.
All
this
was
a
spur
to
her
,
pricking
*NL*
her
to
retaliation
.
She
could
not
fly
in
the
face
of
the
gods
who
*NL*
permitted
him
,
but
that
did
not
prevent
her
from
making
life
miserable
*NL*
for
him
in
petty
ways
.
A
feud
,
ages
old
,
was
between
them
,
and
she
,
for
*NL*
one
,
would
see
to
it
that
he
was
reminded
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Collie
took
advantage
of
her
sex
to
pick
upon
White
Fang
and
maltreat
*NL*
him
.
His
instinct
would
not
permit
him
to
attack
her
,
while
her
*NL*
persistence
would
not
permit
him
to
ignore
her
.
When
she
rushed
at
him
*NL*
he
turned
his
fur-protected
shoulder
to
her
sharp
teeth
and
walked
away
*NL*
stiff-legged
and
stately
.
When
she
forced
him
too
hard
,
he
was
compelled
*NL*
to
go
about
in
a
circle
,
his
shoulder
presented
to
her
,
his
head
turned
*NL*
from
her
,
and
on
his
face
and
in
his
eyes
a
patient
and
bored
expression
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
however
,
a
nip
on
his
hind-quarters
hastened
his
retreat
and
*NL*
made
it
anything
but
stately
.
But
as
a
rule
he
managed
to
maintain
a
*NL*
dignity
that
was
almost
solemnity
.
He
ignored
her
existence
whenever
it
*NL*
was
possible
,
and
made
it
a
point
to
keep
out
of
her
way
.
When
he
saw
or
*NL*
heard
her
coming
,
he
got
up
and
walked
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
in
other
matters
for
White
Fang
to
learn
.
Life
in
the
*NL*
Northland
was
simplicity
itself
when
compared
with
the
complicated
*NL*
affairs
of
Sierra
Vista
.
First
of
all
,
he
had
to
learn
the
family
of
the
*NL*
master
.
In
a
way
he
was
prepared
to
do
this
.
As
Mit-sah
and
Kloo-kooch
*NL*
had
belonged
to
Grey
Beaver
,
sharing
his
food
,
his
fire
,
and
his
*NL*
blankets
,
so
now
,
at
Sierra
Vista
,
belonged
to
the
love-master
all
the
*NL*
denizens
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
this
matter
there
was
a
difference
,
and
many
differences
.
Sierra
*NL*
Vista
was
a
far
vaster
affair
than
the
tepee
of
Grey
Beaver
.
There
were
*NL*
many
persons
to
be
considered
.
There
was
Judge
Scott
,
and
there
was
his
*NL*
wife
.
There
were
the
master
's
two
sisters
,
Beth
and
Mary
.
There
was
his
*NL*
wife
,
Alice
,
and
then
there
were
his
children
,
Weedon
and
Maud
,
toddlers
*NL*
of
four
and
six
.
There
was
no
way
for
anybody
to
tell
him
about
all
*NL*
these
people
,
and
of
blood-ties
and
relationship
he
knew
nothing
whatever
*NL*
and
never
would
be
capable
of
knowing
.
Yet
he
quickly
worked
it
out
that
*NL*
all
of
them
belonged
to
the
master
.
Then
,
by
observation
,
whenever
*NL*
opportunity
offered
,
by
study
of
action
,
speech
,
and
the
very
intonations
*NL*
of
the
voice
,
he
slowly
learned
the
intimacy
and
the
degree
of
favour
*NL*
they
enjoyed
with
the
master
.
And
by
this
ascertained
standard
,
White
*NL*
Fang
treated
them
accordingly
.
What
was
of
value
to
the
master
he
*NL*
valued
;
what
was
dear
to
the
master
was
to
be
cherished
by
White
Fang
and
*NL*
guarded
carefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
was
with
the
two
children
.
All
his
life
he
had
disliked
*NL*
children
.
He
hated
and
feared
their
hands
.
The
lessons
were
not
tender
*NL*
that
he
had
learned
of
their
tyranny
and
cruelty
in
the
days
of
the
*NL*
Indian
villages
.
When
Weedon
and
Maud
had
first
approached
him
,
he
*NL*
growled
warningly
and
looked
malignant
.
A
cuff
from
the
master
and
a
*NL*
sharp
word
had
then
compelled
him
to
permit
their
caresses
,
though
he
*NL*
growled
and
growled
under
their
tiny
hands
,
and
in
the
growl
there
was
no
*NL*
crooning
note
.
Later
,
he
observed
that
the
boy
and
girl
were
of
great
*NL*
value
in
the
master
's
eyes
.
Then
it
was
that
no
cuff
nor
sharp
word
was
*NL*
necessary
before
they
could
pat
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
White
Fang
was
never
effusively
affectionate
.
He
yielded
to
the
*NL*
master
's
children
with
an
ill
but
honest
grace
,
and
endured
their
fooling
*NL*
as
one
would
endure
a
painful
operation
.
When
he
could
no
longer
endure
,
*NL*
he
would
get
up
and
stalk
determinedly
away
from
them
.
But
after
a
time
,
*NL*
he
grew
even
to
like
the
children
.
Still
he
was
not
demonstrative
.
He
*NL*
would
not
go
up
to
them
.
On
the
other
hand
,
instead
of
walking
away
at
*NL*
sight
of
them
,
he
waited
for
them
to
come
to
him
.
And
still
later
,
it
*NL*
was
noticed
that
a
pleased
light
came
into
his
eyes
when
he
saw
them
*NL*
approaching
,
and
that
he
looked
after
them
with
an
appearance
of
curious
*NL*
regret
when
they
left
him
for
other
amusements
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
a
matter
of
development
,
and
took
time
.
Next
in
his
regard
,
*NL*
after
the
children
,
was
Judge
Scott
.
There
were
two
reasons
,
possibly
,
*NL*
for
this
.
First
,
he
was
evidently
a
valuable
possession
of
the
master
's
,
*NL*
and
next
,
he
was
undemonstrative
.
White
Fang
liked
to
lie
at
his
feet
on
*NL*
the
wide
porch
when
he
read
the
newspaper
,
from
time
to
time
favouring
*NL*
White
Fang
with
a
look
or
a
word
--
untroublesome
tokens
that
he
recognised
*NL*
White
Fang
's
presence
and
existence
.
But
this
was
only
when
the
master
*NL*
was
not
around
.
When
the
master
appeared
,
all
other
beings
ceased
to
*NL*
exist
so
far
as
White
Fang
was
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
allowed
all
the
members
of
the
family
to
pet
him
and
make
much
*NL*
of
him
;
but
he
never
gave
to
them
what
he
gave
to
the
master
.
No
caress
*NL*
of
theirs
could
put
the
love-croon
into
his
throat
,
and
,
try
as
they
*NL*
would
,
they
could
never
persuade
him
into
snuggling
against
them
.
This
*NL*
expression
of
abandon
and
surrender
,
of
absolute
trust
,
he
reserved
for
*NL*
the
master
alone
.
In
fact
,
he
never
regarded
the
members
of
the
family
*NL*
in
any
other
light
than
possessions
of
the
love-master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Also
White
Fang
had
early
come
to
differentiate
between
the
family
and
*NL*
the
servants
of
the
household
.
The
latter
were
afraid
of
him
,
while
he
*NL*
merely
refrained
from
attacking
them
.
This
because
he
considered
that
*NL*
they
were
likewise
possessions
of
the
master
.
Between
White
Fang
and
*NL*
them
existed
a
neutrality
and
no
more
.
They
cooked
for
the
master
and
*NL*
washed
the
dishes
and
did
other
things
just
as
Matt
had
done
up
in
the
*NL*
Klondike
.
They
were
,
in
short
,
appurtenances
of
the
household
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
household
there
was
even
more
for
White
Fang
to
learn
.
The
*NL*
master
's
domain
was
wide
and
complex
,
yet
it
had
its
metes
and
bounds
.
*NL*
The
land
itself
ceased
at
the
county
road
.
Outside
was
the
common
domain
*NL*
of
all
gods
--
the
roads
and
streets
.
Then
inside
other
fences
were
the
*NL*
particular
domains
of
other
gods
.
A
myriad
laws
governed
all
these
*NL*
things
and
determined
conduct
;
yet
he
did
not
know
the
speech
of
the
*NL*
gods
,
nor
was
there
any
way
for
him
to
learn
save
by
experience
.
He
*NL*
obeyed
his
natural
impulses
until
they
ran
him
counter
to
some
law
.
When
*NL*
this
had
been
done
a
few
times
,
he
learned
the
law
and
after
that
*NL*
observed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
most
potent
in
his
education
was
the
cuff
of
the
master
's
hand
,
the
*NL*
censure
of
the
master
's
voice
.
Because
of
White
Fang
's
very
great
love
,
*NL*
a
cuff
from
the
master
hurt
him
far
more
than
any
beating
Grey
Beaver
or
*NL*
Beauty
Smith
had
ever
given
him
.
They
had
hurt
only
the
flesh
of
him
;
*NL*
beneath
the
flesh
the
spirit
had
still
raged
,
splendid
and
invincible
.
*NL*
But
with
the
master
the
cuff
was
always
too
light
to
hurt
the
flesh
.
Yet
*NL*
it
went
deeper
.
It
was
an
expression
of
the
master
's
disapproval
,
and
*NL*
White
Fang
's
spirit
wilted
under
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
fact
,
the
cuff
was
rarely
administered
.
The
master
's
voice
*NL*
was
sufficient
.
By
it
White
Fang
knew
whether
he
did
right
or
not
.
By
*NL*
it
he
trimmed
his
conduct
and
adjusted
his
actions
.
It
was
the
compass
*NL*
by
which
he
steered
and
learned
to
chart
the
manners
of
a
new
land
and
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Northland
,
the
only
domesticated
animal
was
the
dog
.
All
other
*NL*
animals
lived
in
the
Wild
,
and
were
,
when
not
too
formidable
,
lawful
*NL*
spoil
for
any
dog
.
All
his
days
White
Fang
had
foraged
among
the
live
*NL*
things
for
food
.
It
did
not
enter
his
head
that
in
the
Southland
it
was
*NL*
otherwise
.
But
this
he
was
to
learn
early
in
his
residence
in
Santa
*NL*
Clara
Valley
.
Sauntering
around
the
corner
of
the
house
in
the
early
*NL*
morning
,
he
came
upon
a
chicken
that
had
escaped
from
the
chicken-yard
.
*NL*
White
Fang
's
natural
impulse
was
to
eat
it
.
A
couple
of
bounds
,
a
flash
*NL*
of
teeth
and
a
frightened
squawk
,
and
he
had
scooped
in
the
adventurous
*NL*
fowl
.
It
was
farm-bred
and
fat
and
tender
;
and
White
Fang
licked
his
*NL*
chops
and
decided
that
such
fare
was
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
day
,
he
chanced
upon
another
stray
chicken
near
the
stables
.
*NL*
One
of
the
grooms
ran
to
the
rescue
.
He
did
not
know
White
Fang
's
breed
,
*NL*
so
for
weapon
he
took
a
light
buggy-whip
.
At
the
first
cut
of
the
whip
,
*NL*
White
Fang
left
the
chicken
for
the
man
.
A
club
might
have
stopped
White
*NL*
Fang
,
but
not
a
whip
.
Silently
,
without
flinching
,
he
took
a
second
cut
*NL*
in
his
forward
rush
,
and
as
he
leaped
for
the
throat
the
groom
cried
out
,
*NL*
``
My
God
!
''
and
staggered
backward
.
He
dropped
the
whip
and
shielded
his
*NL*
throat
with
his
arms
.
In
consequence
,
his
forearm
was
ripped
open
to
the
*NL*
bone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
was
badly
frightened
.
It
was
not
so
much
White
Fang
's
ferocity
*NL*
as
it
was
his
silence
that
unnerved
the
groom
.
Still
protecting
his
*NL*
throat
and
face
with
his
torn
and
bleeding
arm
,
he
tried
to
retreat
to
*NL*
the
barn
.
And
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
him
had
not
Collie
appeared
*NL*
on
the
scene
.
As
she
had
saved
Dick
's
life
,
she
now
saved
the
groom
's
.
*NL*
She
rushed
upon
White
Fang
in
frenzied
wrath
.
She
had
been
right
.
She
*NL*
had
known
better
than
the
blundering
gods
.
All
her
suspicions
were
*NL*
justified
.
Here
was
the
ancient
marauder
up
to
his
old
tricks
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
groom
escaped
into
the
stables
,
and
White
Fang
backed
away
before
*NL*
Collie
's
wicked
teeth
,
or
presented
his
shoulder
to
them
and
circled
*NL*
round
and
round
.
But
Collie
did
not
give
over
,
as
was
her
wont
,
after
a
*NL*
decent
interval
of
chastisement
.
On
the
contrary
,
she
grew
more
excited
*NL*
and
angry
every
moment
,
until
,
in
the
end
,
White
Fang
flung
dignity
to
*NL*
the
winds
and
frankly
fled
away
from
her
across
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
learn
to
leave
chickens
alone
,
''
the
master
said
.
``
But
I
ca
n't
*NL*
give
him
the
lesson
until
I
catch
him
in
the
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
nights
later
came
the
act
,
but
on
a
more
generous
scale
than
the
*NL*
master
had
anticipated
.
White
Fang
had
observed
closely
the
*NL*
chicken-yards
and
the
habits
of
the
chickens
.
In
the
night-time
,
after
*NL*
they
had
gone
to
roost
,
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
pile
of
newly
hauled
*NL*
lumber
.
From
there
he
gained
the
roof
of
a
chicken-house
,
passed
over
*NL*
the
ridgepole
and
dropped
to
the
ground
inside
.
A
moment
later
he
was
*NL*
inside
the
house
,
and
the
slaughter
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
when
the
master
came
out
on
to
the
porch
,
fifty
white
*NL*
Leghorn
hens
,
laid
out
in
a
row
by
the
groom
,
greeted
his
eyes
.
He
*NL*
whistled
to
himself
,
softly
,
first
with
surprise
,
and
then
,
at
the
end
,
*NL*
with
admiration
.
His
eyes
were
likewise
greeted
by
White
Fang
,
but
about
*NL*
the
latter
there
were
no
signs
of
shame
nor
guilt
.
He
carried
himself
*NL*
with
pride
,
as
though
,
forsooth
,
he
had
achieved
a
deed
praiseworthy
and
*NL*
meritorious
.
There
was
about
him
no
consciousness
of
sin
.
The
master
's
*NL*
lips
tightened
as
he
faced
the
disagreeable
task
.
Then
he
talked
harshly
*NL*
to
the
unwitting
culprit
,
and
in
his
voice
there
was
nothing
but
godlike
*NL*
wrath
.
Also
,
he
held
White
Fang
's
nose
down
to
the
slain
hens
,
and
at
*NL*
the
same
time
cuffed
him
soundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
never
raided
a
chicken-roost
again
.
It
was
against
the
law
,
*NL*
and
he
had
learned
it
.
Then
the
master
took
him
into
the
chicken-yards
.
*NL*
White
Fang
's
natural
impulse
,
when
he
saw
the
live
food
fluttering
about
*NL*
him
and
under
his
very
nose
,
was
to
spring
upon
it
.
He
obeyed
the
*NL*
impulse
,
but
was
checked
by
the
master
's
voice
.
They
continued
in
the
*NL*
yards
for
half
an
hour
.
Time
and
again
the
impulse
surged
over
White
*NL*
Fang
,
and
each
time
,
as
he
yielded
to
it
,
he
was
checked
by
the
master
's
*NL*
voice
.
Thus
it
was
he
learned
the
law
,
and
ere
he
left
the
domain
of
the
*NL*
chickens
,
he
had
learned
to
ignore
their
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
never
cure
a
chicken-killer
.
''
Judge
Scott
shook
his
head
sadly
*NL*
at
luncheon
table
,
when
his
son
narrated
the
lesson
he
had
given
White
*NL*
Fang
.
``
Once
they
've
got
the
habit
and
the
taste
of
blood
...
''
Again
*NL*
he
shook
his
head
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Weedon
Scott
did
not
agree
with
his
father
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
*NL*
do
,
''
he
challenged
finally
.
``
I
'll
lock
White
Fang
in
with
the
chickens
*NL*
all
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
think
of
the
chickens
,
''
objected
the
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
furthermore
,
''
the
son
went
on
,
``
for
every
chicken
he
kills
,
I
'll
pay
*NL*
you
one
dollar
gold
coin
of
the
realm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
should
penalise
father
,
too
,
''
interpose
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sister
seconded
her
,
and
a
chorus
of
approval
arose
from
around
the
*NL*
table
.
Judge
Scott
nodded
his
head
in
agreement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
''
Weedon
Scott
pondered
for
a
moment
.
``
And
if
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
afternoon
White
Fang
has
n't
harmed
a
chicken
,
for
every
ten
minutes
*NL*
of
the
time
he
has
spent
in
the
yard
,
you
will
have
to
say
to
him
,
*NL*
gravely
and
with
deliberation
,
just
as
if
you
were
sitting
on
the
bench
*NL*
and
solemnly
passing
judgment
,
`
White
Fang
,
you
are
smarter
than
I
*NL*
thought
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
hidden
points
of
vantage
the
family
watched
the
performance
.
But
it
*NL*
was
a
fizzle
.
Locked
in
the
yard
and
there
deserted
by
the
master
,
White
*NL*
Fang
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
.
Once
he
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
*NL*
trough
for
a
drink
of
water
.
The
chickens
he
calmly
ignored
.
So
far
as
*NL*
he
was
concerned
they
did
not
exist
.
At
four
o'clock
he
executed
a
*NL*
running
jump
,
gained
the
roof
of
the
chicken-house
and
leaped
to
the
*NL*
ground
outside
,
whence
he
sauntered
gravely
to
the
house
.
He
had
learned
*NL*
the
law
.
And
on
the
porch
,
before
the
delighted
family
,
Judge
Scott
,
*NL*
face
to
face
with
White
Fang
,
said
slowly
and
solemnly
,
sixteen
times
,
*NL*
``
White
Fang
,
you
are
smarter
than
I
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
the
multiplicity
of
laws
that
befuddled
White
Fang
and
often
*NL*
brought
him
into
disgrace
.
He
had
to
learn
that
he
must
not
touch
the
*NL*
chickens
that
belonged
to
other
gods
.
Then
there
were
cats
,
and
rabbits
,
*NL*
and
turkeys
;
all
these
he
must
let
alone
.
In
fact
,
when
he
had
but
*NL*
partly
learned
the
law
,
his
impression
was
that
he
must
leave
all
live
*NL*
things
alone
.
Out
in
the
back-pasture
,
a
quail
could
flutter
up
under
*NL*
his
nose
unharmed
.
All
tense
and
trembling
with
eagerness
and
desire
,
he
*NL*
mastered
his
instinct
and
stood
still
.
He
was
obeying
the
will
of
the
*NL*
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
one
day
,
again
out
in
the
back-pasture
,
he
saw
Dick
start
a
*NL*
jackrabbit
and
run
it
.
The
master
himself
was
looking
on
and
did
not
*NL*
interfere
.
Nay
,
he
encouraged
White
Fang
to
join
in
the
chase
.
And
thus
*NL*
he
learned
that
there
was
no
taboo
on
jackrabbits
.
In
the
end
he
worked
*NL*
out
the
complete
law
.
Between
him
and
all
domestic
animals
there
must
be
*NL*
no
hostilities
.
If
not
amity
,
at
least
neutrality
must
obtain
.
But
the
*NL*
other
animals
--
the
squirrels
,
and
quail
,
and
cottontails
,
were
creatures
*NL*
of
the
Wild
who
had
never
yielded
allegiance
to
man
.
They
were
the
*NL*
lawful
prey
of
any
dog
.
It
was
only
the
tame
that
the
gods
protected
,
*NL*
and
between
the
tame
deadly
strife
was
not
permitted
.
The
gods
held
the
*NL*
power
of
life
and
death
over
their
subjects
,
and
the
gods
were
jealous
of
*NL*
their
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Life
was
complex
in
the
Santa
Clara
Valley
after
the
simplicities
of
the
*NL*
Northland
.
And
the
chief
thing
demanded
by
these
intricacies
of
*NL*
civilisation
was
control
,
restraint
--
a
poise
of
self
that
was
as
delicate
*NL*
as
the
fluttering
of
gossamer
wings
and
at
the
same
time
as
rigid
as
*NL*
steel
.
Life
had
a
thousand
faces
,
and
White
Fang
found
he
must
meet
them
*NL*
all
--
thus
,
when
he
went
to
town
,
in
to
San
Jose
,
running
behind
the
*NL*
carriage
or
loafing
about
the
streets
when
the
carriage
stopped
.
Life
*NL*
flowed
past
him
,
deep
and
wide
and
varied
,
continually
impinging
upon
his
*NL*
senses
,
demanding
of
him
instant
and
endless
adjustments
and
*NL*
correspondences
,
and
compelling
him
,
almost
always
,
to
suppress
his
*NL*
natural
impulses
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
butcher-shops
where
meat
hung
within
reach
.
This
meat
he
must
*NL*
not
touch
.
There
were
cats
at
the
houses
the
master
visited
that
must
be
*NL*
let
alone
.
And
there
were
dogs
everywhere
that
snarled
at
him
and
that
*NL*
he
must
not
attack
.
And
then
,
on
the
crowded
sidewalks
there
were
*NL*
persons
innumerable
whose
attention
he
attracted
.
They
would
stop
and
*NL*
look
at
him
,
point
him
out
to
one
another
,
examine
him
,
talk
of
him
,
and
,
*NL*
worst
of
all
,
pat
him
.
And
these
perilous
contacts
from
all
these
*NL*
strange
hands
he
must
endure
.
Yet
this
endurance
he
achieved
.
*NL*
Furthermore
,
he
got
over
being
awkward
and
self-conscious
.
In
a
lofty
*NL*
way
he
received
the
attentions
of
the
multitudes
of
strange
gods
.
With
*NL*
condescension
he
accepted
their
condescension
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
*NL*
was
something
about
him
that
prevented
great
familiarity
.
They
patted
*NL*
him
on
the
head
and
passed
on
,
contented
and
pleased
with
their
own
*NL*
daring
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
all
easy
for
White
Fang
.
Running
behind
the
carriage
in
*NL*
the
outskirts
of
San
Jose
,
he
encountered
certain
small
boys
who
made
a
*NL*
practice
of
flinging
stones
at
him
.
Yet
he
knew
that
it
was
not
*NL*
permitted
him
to
pursue
and
drag
them
down
.
Here
he
was
compelled
to
*NL*
violate
his
instinct
of
self-preservation
,
and
violate
it
he
did
,
for
he
*NL*
was
becoming
tame
and
qualifying
himself
for
civilisation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
White
Fang
was
not
quite
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
.
He
*NL*
had
no
abstract
ideas
about
justice
and
fair
play
.
But
there
is
a
*NL*
certain
sense
of
equity
that
resides
in
life
,
and
it
was
this
sense
in
*NL*
him
that
resented
the
unfairness
of
his
being
permitted
no
defence
*NL*
against
the
stone-throwers
.
He
forgot
that
in
the
covenant
entered
into
*NL*
between
him
and
the
gods
they
were
pledged
to
care
for
him
and
defend
*NL*
him
.
But
one
day
the
master
sprang
from
the
carriage
,
whip
in
hand
,
and
*NL*
gave
the
stone-throwers
a
thrashing
.
After
that
they
threw
stones
no
*NL*
more
,
and
White
Fang
understood
and
was
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
other
experience
of
similar
nature
was
his
.
On
the
way
to
town
,
*NL*
hanging
around
the
saloon
at
the
cross-roads
,
were
three
dogs
that
made
a
*NL*
practice
of
rushing
out
upon
him
when
he
went
by
.
Knowing
his
deadly
*NL*
method
of
fighting
,
the
master
had
never
ceased
impressing
upon
White
*NL*
Fang
the
law
that
he
must
not
fight
.
As
a
result
,
having
learned
the
*NL*
lesson
well
,
White
Fang
was
hard
put
whenever
he
passed
the
cross-roads
*NL*
saloon
.
After
the
first
rush
,
each
time
,
his
snarl
kept
the
three
dogs
*NL*
at
a
distance
but
they
trailed
along
behind
,
yelping
and
bickering
and
*NL*
insulting
him
.
This
endured
for
some
time
.
The
men
at
the
saloon
even
*NL*
urged
the
dogs
on
to
attack
White
Fang
.
One
day
they
openly
sicked
the
*NL*
dogs
on
him
.
The
master
stopped
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
it
,
''
he
said
to
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
White
Fang
could
not
believe
.
He
looked
at
the
master
,
and
he
looked
*NL*
at
the
dogs
.
Then
he
looked
back
eagerly
and
questioningly
at
the
*NL*
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
nodded
his
head
.
``
Go
to
them
,
old
fellow
.
Eat
them
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
no
longer
hesitated
.
He
turned
and
leaped
silently
among
his
*NL*
enemies
.
All
three
faced
him
.
There
was
a
great
snarling
and
growling
,
*NL*
a
clashing
of
teeth
and
a
flurry
of
bodies
.
The
dust
of
the
road
arose
*NL*
in
a
cloud
and
screened
the
battle
.
But
at
the
end
of
several
minutes
*NL*
two
dogs
were
struggling
in
the
dirt
and
the
third
was
in
full
flight
.
He
*NL*
leaped
a
ditch
,
went
through
a
rail
fence
,
and
fled
across
a
field
.
White
*NL*
Fang
followed
,
sliding
over
the
ground
in
wolf
fashion
and
with
wolf
*NL*
speed
,
swiftly
and
without
noise
,
and
in
the
centre
of
the
field
he
*NL*
dragged
down
and
slew
the
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
triple
killing
his
main
troubles
with
dogs
ceased
.
The
word
*NL*
went
up
and
down
the
valley
,
and
men
saw
to
it
that
their
dogs
did
not
*NL*
molest
the
Fighting
Wolf
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
CALL
OF
KIND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
months
came
and
went
.
There
was
plenty
of
food
and
no
work
in
the
*NL*
Southland
,
and
White
Fang
lived
fat
and
prosperous
and
happy
.
Not
alone
*NL*
was
he
in
the
geographical
Southland
,
for
he
was
in
the
Southland
of
*NL*
life
.
Human
kindness
was
like
a
sun
shining
upon
him
,
and
he
flourished
*NL*
like
a
flower
planted
in
good
soil
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
remained
somehow
different
from
other
dogs
.
He
knew
the
law
*NL*
even
better
than
did
the
dogs
that
had
known
no
other
life
,
and
he
*NL*
observed
the
law
more
punctiliously
;
but
still
there
was
about
him
a
*NL*
suggestion
of
lurking
ferocity
,
as
though
the
Wild
still
lingered
in
him
*NL*
and
the
wolf
in
him
merely
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
chummed
with
other
dogs
.
Lonely
he
had
lived
,
so
far
as
his
*NL*
kind
was
concerned
,
and
lonely
he
would
continue
to
live
.
In
his
*NL*
puppyhood
,
under
the
persecution
of
Lip-lip
and
the
puppy-pack
,
and
in
*NL*
his
fighting
days
with
Beauty
Smith
,
he
had
acquired
a
fixed
aversion
for
*NL*
dogs
.
The
natural
course
of
his
life
had
been
diverted
,
and
,
recoiling
*NL*
from
his
kind
,
he
had
clung
to
the
human
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
all
Southland
dogs
looked
upon
him
with
suspicion
.
He
aroused
*NL*
in
them
their
instinctive
fear
of
the
Wild
,
and
they
greeted
him
always
*NL*
with
snarl
and
growl
and
belligerent
hatred
.
He
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
learned
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
use
his
teeth
upon
them
.
His
naked
*NL*
fangs
and
writhing
lips
were
uniformly
efficacious
,
rarely
failing
to
*NL*
send
a
bellowing
on-rushing
dog
back
on
its
haunches
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
one
trial
in
White
Fang
's
life
--
Collie
.
She
never
gave
him
*NL*
a
moment
's
peace
.
She
was
not
so
amenable
to
the
law
as
he
.
She
defied
*NL*
all
efforts
of
the
master
to
make
her
become
friends
with
White
Fang
.
*NL*
Ever
in
his
ears
was
sounding
her
sharp
and
nervous
snarl
.
She
had
never
*NL*
forgiven
him
the
chicken-killing
episode
,
and
persistently
held
to
the
*NL*
belief
that
his
intentions
were
bad
.
She
found
him
guilty
before
the
*NL*
act
,
and
treated
him
accordingly
.
She
became
a
pest
to
him
,
like
a
*NL*
policeman
following
him
around
the
stable
and
the
hounds
,
and
,
if
he
even
*NL*
so
much
as
glanced
curiously
at
a
pigeon
or
chicken
,
bursting
into
an
*NL*
outcry
of
indignation
and
wrath
.
His
favourite
way
of
ignoring
her
was
*NL*
to
lie
down
,
with
his
head
on
his
fore-paws
,
and
pretend
sleep
.
This
*NL*
always
dumfounded
and
silenced
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
exception
of
Collie
,
all
things
went
well
with
White
Fang
.
He
*NL*
had
learned
control
and
poise
,
and
he
knew
the
law
.
He
achieved
a
*NL*
staidness
,
and
calmness
,
and
philosophic
tolerance
.
He
no
longer
lived
*NL*
in
a
hostile
environment
.
Danger
and
hurt
and
death
did
not
lurk
*NL*
everywhere
about
him
.
In
time
,
the
unknown
,
as
a
thing
of
terror
and
*NL*
menace
ever
impending
,
faded
away
.
Life
was
soft
and
easy
.
It
flowed
*NL*
along
smoothly
,
and
neither
fear
nor
foe
lurked
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
missed
the
snow
without
being
aware
of
it
.
``
An
unduly
long
summer
,
''
*NL*
would
have
been
his
thought
had
he
thought
about
it
;
as
it
was
,
he
merely
*NL*
missed
the
snow
in
a
vague
,
subconscious
way
.
In
the
same
fashion
,
*NL*
especially
in
the
heat
of
summer
when
he
suffered
from
the
sun
,
he
*NL*
experienced
faint
longings
for
the
Northland
.
Their
only
effect
upon
*NL*
him
,
however
,
was
to
make
him
uneasy
and
restless
without
his
knowing
*NL*
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
had
never
been
very
demonstrative
.
Beyond
his
snuggling
and
*NL*
the
throwing
of
a
crooning
note
into
his
love-growl
,
he
had
no
way
of
*NL*
expressing
his
love
.
Yet
it
was
given
him
to
discover
a
third
way
.
He
*NL*
had
always
been
susceptible
to
the
laughter
of
the
gods
.
Laughter
had
*NL*
affected
him
with
madness
,
made
him
frantic
with
rage
.
But
he
did
not
*NL*
have
it
in
him
to
be
angry
with
the
love-master
,
and
when
that
god
*NL*
elected
to
laugh
at
him
in
a
good-natured
,
bantering
way
,
he
was
*NL*
nonplussed
.
He
could
feel
the
pricking
and
stinging
of
the
old
anger
as
*NL*
it
strove
to
rise
up
in
him
,
but
it
strove
against
love
.
He
could
not
be
*NL*
angry
;
yet
he
had
to
do
something
.
At
first
he
was
dignified
,
and
the
*NL*
master
laughed
the
harder
.
Then
he
tried
to
be
more
dignified
,
and
the
*NL*
master
laughed
harder
than
before
.
In
the
end
,
the
master
laughed
him
*NL*
out
of
his
dignity
.
His
jaws
slightly
parted
,
his
lips
lifted
a
little
,
*NL*
and
a
quizzical
expression
that
was
more
love
than
humour
came
into
his
*NL*
eyes
.
He
had
learned
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Likewise
he
learned
to
romp
with
the
master
,
to
be
tumbled
down
and
*NL*
rolled
over
,
and
be
the
victim
of
innumerable
rough
tricks
.
In
return
he
*NL*
feigned
anger
,
bristling
and
growling
ferociously
,
and
clipping
his
teeth
*NL*
together
in
snaps
that
had
all
the
seeming
of
deadly
intention
.
But
he
*NL*
never
forgot
himself
.
Those
snaps
were
always
delivered
on
the
empty
*NL*
air
.
At
the
end
of
such
a
romp
,
when
blow
and
cuff
and
snap
and
snarl
*NL*
were
last
and
furious
,
they
would
break
off
suddenly
and
stand
several
*NL*
feet
apart
,
glaring
at
each
other
.
And
then
,
just
as
suddenly
,
like
the
*NL*
sun
rising
on
a
stormy
sea
,
they
would
begin
to
laugh
.
This
would
always
*NL*
culminate
with
the
master
's
arms
going
around
White
Fang
's
neck
and
*NL*
shoulders
while
the
latter
crooned
and
growled
his
love-song
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
nobody
else
ever
romped
with
White
Fang
.
He
did
not
permit
it
.
He
*NL*
stood
on
his
dignity
,
and
when
they
attempted
it
,
his
warning
snarl
and
*NL*
bristling
mane
were
anything
but
playful
.
That
he
allowed
the
master
*NL*
these
liberties
was
no
reason
that
he
should
be
a
common
dog
,
loving
here
*NL*
and
loving
there
,
everybody
's
property
for
a
romp
and
good
time
.
He
*NL*
loved
with
single
heart
and
refused
to
cheapen
himself
or
his
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
went
out
on
horseback
a
great
deal
,
and
to
accompany
him
was
*NL*
one
of
White
Fang
's
chief
duties
in
life
.
In
the
Northland
he
had
*NL*
evidenced
his
fealty
by
toiling
in
the
harness
;
but
there
were
no
sleds
*NL*
in
the
Southland
,
nor
did
dogs
pack
burdens
on
their
backs
.
So
he
*NL*
rendered
fealty
in
the
new
way
,
by
running
with
the
master
's
horse
.
The
*NL*
longest
day
never
played
White
Fang
out
.
His
was
the
gait
of
the
wolf
,
*NL*
smooth
,
tireless
and
effortless
,
and
at
the
end
of
fifty
miles
he
would
*NL*
come
in
jauntily
ahead
of
the
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
connection
with
the
riding
,
that
White
Fang
achieved
one
other
*NL*
mode
of
expression
--
remarkable
in
that
he
did
it
but
twice
in
all
his
*NL*
life
.
The
first
time
occurred
when
the
master
was
trying
to
teach
a
*NL*
spirited
thoroughbred
the
method
of
opening
and
closing
gates
without
the
*NL*
rider
's
dismounting
.
Time
and
again
and
many
times
he
ranged
the
horse
*NL*
up
to
the
gate
in
the
effort
to
close
it
and
each
time
the
horse
became
*NL*
frightened
and
backed
and
plunged
away
.
It
grew
more
nervous
and
excited
*NL*
every
moment
.
When
it
reared
,
the
master
put
the
spurs
to
it
and
made
it
*NL*
drop
its
fore-legs
back
to
earth
,
whereupon
it
would
begin
kicking
with
*NL*
its
hind-legs
.
White
Fang
watched
the
performance
with
increasing
*NL*
anxiety
until
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
,
when
he
sprang
in
front
*NL*
of
the
horse
and
barked
savagely
and
warningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
often
tried
to
bark
thereafter
,
and
the
master
encouraged
him
,
*NL*
he
succeeded
only
once
,
and
then
it
was
not
in
the
master
's
presence
.
A
*NL*
scamper
across
the
pasture
,
a
jackrabbit
rising
suddenly
under
the
*NL*
horse
's
feet
,
a
violent
sheer
,
a
stumble
,
a
fall
to
earth
,
and
a
broken
*NL*
leg
for
the
master
,
was
the
cause
of
it
.
White
Fang
sprang
in
a
rage
at
*NL*
the
throat
of
the
offending
horse
,
but
was
checked
by
the
master
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Home
!
Go
home
!
''
the
master
commanded
when
he
had
ascertained
his
*NL*
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
was
disinclined
to
desert
him
.
The
master
thought
of
writing
*NL*
a
note
,
but
searched
his
pockets
vainly
for
pencil
and
paper
.
Again
he
*NL*
commanded
White
Fang
to
go
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
regarded
him
wistfully
,
started
away
,
then
returned
and
whined
*NL*
softly
.
The
master
talked
to
him
gently
but
seriously
,
and
he
cocked
his
*NL*
ears
,
and
listened
with
painful
intentness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
old
fellow
,
you
just
run
along
home
,
''
ran
the
talk
.
*NL*
``
Go
on
home
and
tell
them
what
's
happened
to
me
.
Home
with
you
,
you
*NL*
wolf
.
Get
along
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
knew
the
meaning
of
``
home
,
''
and
though
he
did
not
understand
*NL*
the
remainder
of
the
master
's
language
,
he
knew
it
was
his
will
that
he
*NL*
should
go
home
.
He
turned
and
trotted
reluctantly
away
.
Then
he
*NL*
stopped
,
undecided
,
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
home
!
''
came
the
sharp
command
,
and
this
time
he
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
was
on
the
porch
,
taking
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
,
when
White
*NL*
Fang
arrived
.
He
came
in
among
them
,
panting
,
covered
with
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weedon
's
back
,
''
Weedon
's
mother
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
welcomed
White
Fang
with
glad
cries
and
ran
to
meet
him
.
He
*NL*
avoided
them
and
passed
down
the
porch
,
but
they
cornered
him
against
a
*NL*
rocking-chair
and
the
railing
.
He
growled
and
tried
to
push
by
them
.
*NL*
Their
mother
looked
apprehensively
in
their
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
he
makes
me
nervous
around
the
children
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
have
*NL*
a
dread
that
he
will
turn
upon
them
unexpectedly
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Growling
savagely
,
White
Fang
sprang
out
of
the
corner
,
overturning
the
*NL*
boy
and
the
girl
.
The
mother
called
them
to
her
and
comforted
them
,
*NL*
telling
them
not
to
bother
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wolf
is
a
wolf
!
''
commented
Judge
Scott
.
``
There
is
no
trusting
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
is
not
all
wolf
,
''
interposed
Beth
,
standing
for
her
brother
in
*NL*
his
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
only
Weedon
's
opinion
for
that
,
''
rejoined
the
judge
.
``
He
*NL*
merely
surmises
that
there
is
some
strain
of
dog
in
White
Fang
;
but
as
he
*NL*
will
tell
you
himself
,
he
knows
nothing
about
it
.
As
for
his
*NL*
appearance
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
his
sentence
.
White
Fang
stood
before
him
,
growling
*NL*
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
!
Lie
down
,
sir
!
''
Judge
Scott
commanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
turned
to
the
love-master
's
wife
.
She
screamed
with
fright
as
*NL*
he
seized
her
dress
in
his
teeth
and
dragged
on
it
till
the
frail
fabric
*NL*
tore
away
.
By
this
time
he
had
become
the
centre
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
ceased
from
his
growling
and
stood
,
head
up
,
looking
into
their
*NL*
faces
.
His
throat
worked
spasmodically
,
but
made
no
sound
,
while
he
*NL*
struggled
with
all
his
body
,
convulsed
with
the
effort
to
rid
himself
of
*NL*
the
incommunicable
something
that
strained
for
utterance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
he
is
not
going
mad
,
''
said
Weedon
's
mother
.
``
I
told
Weedon
that
*NL*
I
was
afraid
the
warm
climate
would
not
agree
with
an
Arctic
animal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
trying
to
speak
,
I
do
believe
,
''
Beth
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
speech
came
to
White
Fang
,
rushing
up
in
a
great
burst
of
*NL*
barking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
has
happened
to
Weedon
,
''
his
wife
said
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
on
their
feet
now
,
and
White
Fang
ran
down
the
steps
,
*NL*
looking
back
for
them
to
follow
.
For
the
second
and
last
time
in
his
*NL*
life
he
had
barked
and
made
himself
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
event
he
found
a
warmer
place
in
the
hearts
of
the
Sierra
*NL*
Vista
people
,
and
even
the
groom
whose
arm
he
had
slashed
admitted
that
*NL*
he
was
a
wise
dog
even
if
he
was
a
wolf
.
Judge
Scott
still
held
to
the
*NL*
same
opinion
,
and
proved
it
to
everybody
's
dissatisfaction
by
*NL*
measurements
and
descriptions
taken
from
the
encyclopaedia
and
various
*NL*
works
on
natural
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
days
came
and
went
,
streaming
their
unbroken
sunshine
over
the
Santa
*NL*
Clara
Valley
.
But
as
they
grew
shorter
and
White
Fang
's
second
winter
in
*NL*
the
Southland
came
on
,
he
made
a
strange
discovery
.
Collie
's
teeth
were
*NL*
no
longer
sharp
.
There
was
a
playfulness
about
her
nips
and
a
gentleness
*NL*
that
prevented
them
from
really
hurting
him
.
He
forgot
that
she
had
made
*NL*
life
a
burden
to
him
,
and
when
she
disported
herself
around
him
he
*NL*
responded
solemnly
,
striving
to
be
playful
and
becoming
no
more
than
*NL*
ridiculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
she
led
him
off
on
a
long
chase
through
the
back-pasture
land
*NL*
into
the
woods
.
It
was
the
afternoon
that
the
master
was
to
ride
,
and
*NL*
White
Fang
knew
it
.
The
horse
stood
saddled
and
waiting
at
the
door
.
*NL*
White
Fang
hesitated
.
But
there
was
that
in
him
deeper
than
all
the
law
*NL*
he
had
learned
,
than
the
customs
that
had
moulded
him
,
than
his
love
for
*NL*
the
master
,
than
the
very
will
to
live
of
himself
;
and
when
,
in
the
*NL*
moment
of
his
indecision
,
Collie
nipped
him
and
scampered
off
,
he
turned
*NL*
and
followed
after
.
The
master
rode
alone
that
day
;
and
in
the
woods
,
*NL*
side
by
side
,
White
Fang
ran
with
Collie
,
as
his
mother
,
Kiche
,
and
old
*NL*
One
Eye
had
run
long
years
before
in
the
silent
Northland
forest
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
SLEEPING
WOLF
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
this
time
that
the
newspapers
were
full
of
the
daring
escape
*NL*
of
a
convict
from
San
Quentin
prison
.
He
was
a
ferocious
man
.
He
had
*NL*
been
ill-made
in
the
making
.
He
had
not
been
born
right
,
and
he
had
not
*NL*
been
helped
any
by
the
moulding
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
society
.
*NL*
The
hands
of
society
are
harsh
,
and
this
man
was
a
striking
sample
of
its
*NL*
handiwork
.
He
was
a
beast
--
a
human
beast
,
it
is
true
,
but
nevertheless
*NL*
so
terrible
a
beast
that
he
can
best
be
characterised
as
carnivorous
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
San
Quentin
prison
he
had
proved
incorrigible
.
Punishment
failed
to
*NL*
break
his
spirit
.
He
could
die
dumb-mad
and
fighting
to
the
last
,
but
he
*NL*
could
not
live
and
be
beaten
.
The
more
fiercely
he
fought
,
the
more
*NL*
harshly
society
handled
him
,
and
the
only
effect
of
harshness
was
to
make
*NL*
him
fiercer
.
Strait-jackets
,
starvation
,
and
beatings
and
clubbings
*NL*
were
the
wrong
treatment
for
Jim
Hall
;
but
it
was
the
treatment
he
*NL*
received
.
It
was
the
treatment
he
had
received
from
the
time
he
was
a
*NL*
little
pulpy
boy
in
a
San
Francisco
slum
--
soft
clay
in
the
hands
of
*NL*
society
and
ready
to
be
formed
into
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
Jim
Hall
's
third
term
in
prison
that
he
encountered
a
guard
*NL*
that
was
almost
as
great
a
beast
as
he
.
The
guard
treated
him
unfairly
,
*NL*
lied
about
him
to
the
warden
,
lost
his
credits
,
persecuted
him
.
The
*NL*
difference
between
them
was
that
the
guard
carried
a
bunch
of
keys
and
a
*NL*
revolver
.
Jim
Hall
had
only
his
naked
hands
and
his
teeth
.
But
he
*NL*
sprang
upon
the
guard
one
day
and
used
his
teeth
on
the
other
's
throat
*NL*
just
like
any
jungle
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
Jim
Hall
went
to
live
in
the
incorrigible
cell
.
He
lived
*NL*
there
three
years
.
The
cell
was
of
iron
,
the
floor
,
the
walls
,
the
roof
.
*NL*
He
never
left
this
cell
.
He
never
saw
the
sky
nor
the
sunshine
.
Day
was
*NL*
a
twilight
and
night
was
a
black
silence
.
He
was
in
an
iron
tomb
,
buried
*NL*
alive
.
He
saw
no
human
face
,
spoke
to
no
human
thing
.
When
his
food
was
*NL*
shoved
in
to
him
,
he
growled
like
a
wild
animal
.
He
hated
all
things
.
*NL*
For
days
and
nights
he
bellowed
his
rage
at
the
universe
.
For
weeks
and
*NL*
months
he
never
made
a
sound
,
in
the
black
silence
eating
his
very
soul
.
*NL*
He
was
a
man
and
a
monstrosity
,
as
fearful
a
thing
of
fear
as
ever
*NL*
gibbered
in
the
visions
of
a
maddened
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
one
night
,
he
escaped
.
The
warders
said
it
was
impossible
,
but
*NL*
nevertheless
the
cell
was
empty
,
and
half
in
half
out
of
it
lay
the
body
*NL*
of
a
dead
guard
.
Two
other
dead
guards
marked
his
trail
through
the
*NL*
prison
to
the
outer
walls
,
and
he
had
killed
with
his
hands
to
avoid
*NL*
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
armed
with
the
weapons
of
the
slain
guards
--
a
live
arsenal
that
*NL*
fled
through
the
hills
pursued
by
the
organised
might
of
society
.
A
*NL*
heavy
price
of
gold
was
upon
his
head
.
Avaricious
farmers
hunted
him
*NL*
with
shot-guns
.
His
blood
might
pay
off
a
mortgage
or
send
a
son
to
*NL*
college
.
Public-spirited
citizens
took
down
their
rifles
and
went
out
*NL*
after
him
.
A
pack
of
bloodhounds
followed
the
way
of
his
bleeding
feet
.
*NL*
And
the
sleuth-hounds
of
the
law
,
the
paid
fighting
animals
of
society
,
*NL*
with
telephone
,
and
telegraph
,
and
special
train
,
clung
to
his
trail
*NL*
night
and
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
they
came
upon
him
,
and
men
faced
him
like
heroes
,
or
stampeded
*NL*
through
barbed-wire
fences
to
the
delight
of
the
commonwealth
reading
the
*NL*
account
at
the
breakfast
table
.
It
was
after
such
encounters
that
the
*NL*
dead
and
wounded
were
carted
back
to
the
towns
,
and
their
places
filled
*NL*
by
men
eager
for
the
man-hunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Jim
Hall
disappeared
.
The
bloodhounds
vainly
quested
on
the
*NL*
lost
trail
.
Inoffensive
ranchers
in
remote
valleys
were
held
up
by
armed
*NL*
men
and
compelled
to
identify
themselves
.
While
the
remains
of
Jim
Hall
*NL*
were
discovered
on
a
dozen
mountain-sides
by
greedy
claimants
for
blood
-
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
newspapers
were
read
at
Sierra
Vista
,
not
so
much
*NL*
with
interest
as
with
anxiety
.
The
women
were
afraid
.
Judge
Scott
pooh
-
*NL*
poohed
and
laughed
,
but
not
with
reason
,
for
it
was
in
his
last
days
on
*NL*
the
bench
that
Jim
Hall
had
stood
before
him
and
received
sentence
.
And
*NL*
in
open
court-room
,
before
all
men
,
Jim
Hall
had
proclaimed
that
the
day
*NL*
would
come
when
he
would
wreak
vengeance
on
the
Judge
that
sentenced
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
once
,
Jim
Hall
was
right
.
He
was
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
*NL*
was
sentenced
.
It
was
a
case
,
in
the
parlance
of
thieves
and
police
,
of
*NL*
``
rail-roading
.
''
Jim
Hall
was
being
``
rail-roaded
''
to
prison
for
a
crime
*NL*
he
had
not
committed
.
Because
of
the
two
prior
convictions
against
him
,
*NL*
Judge
Scott
imposed
upon
him
a
sentence
of
fifty
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Scott
did
not
know
all
things
,
and
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
*NL*
party
to
a
police
conspiracy
,
that
the
evidence
was
hatched
and
perjured
,
*NL*
that
Jim
Hall
was
guiltless
of
the
crime
charged
.
And
Jim
Hall
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
did
not
know
that
Judge
Scott
was
merely
ignorant
.
Jim
Hall
*NL*
believed
that
the
judge
knew
all
about
it
and
was
hand
in
glove
with
the
*NL*
police
in
the
perpetration
of
the
monstrous
injustice
.
So
it
was
,
when
*NL*
the
doom
of
fifty
years
of
living
death
was
uttered
by
Judge
Scott
,
that
*NL*
Jim
Hall
,
hating
all
things
in
the
society
that
misused
him
,
rose
up
and
*NL*
raged
in
the
court-room
until
dragged
down
by
half
a
dozen
of
his
blue
-
*NL*
coated
enemies
.
To
him
,
Judge
Scott
was
the
keystone
in
the
arch
of
*NL*
injustice
,
and
upon
Judge
Scott
he
emptied
the
vials
of
his
wrath
and
*NL*
hurled
the
threats
of
his
revenge
yet
to
come
.
Then
Jim
Hall
went
to
his
*NL*
living
death
...
and
escaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
this
White
Fang
knew
nothing
.
But
between
him
and
Alice
,
the
*NL*
master
's
wife
,
there
existed
a
secret
.
Each
night
,
after
Sierra
Vista
*NL*
had
gone
to
bed
,
she
rose
and
let
in
White
Fang
to
sleep
in
the
big
hall
.
*NL*
Now
White
Fang
was
not
a
house-dog
,
nor
was
he
permitted
to
sleep
in
the
*NL*
house
;
so
each
morning
,
early
,
she
slipped
down
and
let
him
out
before
*NL*
the
family
was
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
such
night
,
while
all
the
house
slept
,
White
Fang
awoke
and
lay
*NL*
very
quietly
.
And
very
quietly
he
smelled
the
air
and
read
the
message
*NL*
it
bore
of
a
strange
god
's
presence
.
And
to
his
ears
came
sounds
of
the
*NL*
strange
god
's
movements
.
White
Fang
burst
into
no
furious
outcry
.
It
*NL*
was
not
his
way
.
The
strange
god
walked
softly
,
but
more
softly
walked
*NL*
White
Fang
,
for
he
had
no
clothes
to
rub
against
the
flesh
of
his
body
.
*NL*
He
followed
silently
.
In
the
Wild
he
had
hunted
live
meat
that
was
*NL*
infinitely
timid
,
and
he
knew
the
advantage
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strange
god
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
and
listened
,
*NL*
and
White
Fang
was
as
dead
,
so
without
movement
was
he
as
he
watched
and
*NL*
waited
.
Up
that
staircase
the
way
led
to
the
love-master
and
to
the
love
-
*NL*
master
's
dearest
possessions
.
White
Fang
bristled
,
but
waited
.
The
*NL*
strange
god
's
foot
lifted
.
He
was
beginning
the
ascent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
that
White
Fang
struck
.
He
gave
no
warning
,
with
no
snarl
*NL*
anticipated
his
own
action
.
Into
the
air
he
lifted
his
body
in
the
*NL*
spring
that
landed
him
on
the
strange
god
's
back
.
White
Fang
clung
with
*NL*
his
fore-paws
to
the
man
's
shoulders
,
at
the
same
time
burying
his
fangs
*NL*
into
the
back
of
the
man
's
neck
.
He
clung
on
for
a
moment
,
long
enough
*NL*
to
drag
the
god
over
backward
.
Together
they
crashed
to
the
floor
.
White
*NL*
Fang
leaped
clear
,
and
,
as
the
man
struggled
to
rise
,
was
in
again
with
*NL*
the
slashing
fangs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sierra
Vista
awoke
in
alarm
.
The
noise
from
downstairs
was
as
that
of
a
*NL*
score
of
battling
fiends
.
There
were
revolver
shots
.
A
man
's
voice
*NL*
screamed
once
in
horror
and
anguish
.
There
was
a
great
snarling
and
*NL*
growling
,
and
over
all
arose
a
smashing
and
crashing
of
furniture
and
*NL*
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
almost
as
quickly
as
it
had
arisen
,
the
commotion
died
away
.
The
*NL*
struggle
had
not
lasted
more
than
three
minutes
.
The
frightened
*NL*
household
clustered
at
the
top
of
the
stairway
.
From
below
,
as
from
out
*NL*
an
abyss
of
blackness
,
came
up
a
gurgling
sound
,
as
of
air
bubbling
*NL*
through
water
.
Sometimes
this
gurgle
became
sibilant
,
almost
a
whistle
.
*NL*
But
this
,
too
,
quickly
died
down
and
ceased
.
Then
naught
came
up
out
of
*NL*
the
blackness
save
a
heavy
panting
of
some
creature
struggling
sorely
for
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weedon
Scott
pressed
a
button
,
and
the
staircase
and
downstairs
hall
were
*NL*
flooded
with
light
.
Then
he
and
Judge
Scott
,
revolvers
in
hand
,
*NL*
cautiously
descended
.
There
was
no
need
for
this
caution
.
White
Fang
*NL*
had
done
his
work
.
In
the
midst
of
the
wreckage
of
overthrown
and
*NL*
smashed
furniture
,
partly
on
his
side
,
his
face
hidden
by
an
arm
,
lay
a
*NL*
man
.
Weedon
Scott
bent
over
,
removed
the
arm
and
turned
the
man
's
face
*NL*
upward
.
A
gaping
throat
explained
the
manner
of
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
Hall
,
''
said
Judge
Scott
,
and
father
and
son
looked
significantly
at
*NL*
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
turned
to
White
Fang
.
He
,
too
,
was
lying
on
his
side
.
His
*NL*
eyes
were
closed
,
but
the
lids
slightly
lifted
in
an
effort
to
look
at
*NL*
them
as
they
bent
over
him
,
and
the
tail
was
perceptibly
agitated
in
a
*NL*
vain
effort
to
wag
.
Weedon
Scott
patted
him
,
and
his
throat
rumbled
an
*NL*
acknowledging
growl
.
But
it
was
a
weak
growl
at
best
,
and
it
quickly
*NL*
ceased
.
His
eyelids
drooped
and
went
shut
,
and
his
whole
body
seemed
to
*NL*
relax
and
flatten
out
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
all
in
,
poor
devil
,
''
muttered
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
see
about
that
,
''
asserted
the
Judge
,
as
he
started
for
the
*NL*
telephone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frankly
,
he
has
one
chance
in
a
thousand
,
''
announced
the
surgeon
,
after
*NL*
he
had
worked
an
hour
and
a
half
on
White
Fang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawn
was
breaking
through
the
windows
and
dimming
the
electric
lights
.
*NL*
With
the
exception
of
the
children
,
the
whole
family
was
gathered
about
*NL*
the
surgeon
to
hear
his
verdict
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
broken
hind-leg
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
Three
broken
ribs
,
one
at
least
of
*NL*
which
has
pierced
the
lungs
.
He
has
lost
nearly
all
the
blood
in
his
*NL*
body
.
There
is
a
large
likelihood
of
internal
injuries
.
He
must
have
*NL*
been
jumped
upon
.
To
say
nothing
of
three
bullet
holes
clear
through
*NL*
him
.
One
chance
in
a
thousand
is
really
optimistic
.
He
has
n't
a
chance
*NL*
in
ten
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
must
n't
lose
any
chance
that
might
be
of
help
to
him
,
''
Judge
*NL*
Scott
exclaimed
.
``
Never
mind
expense
.
Put
him
under
the
X-ray
--
anything
.
*NL*
Weedon
,
telegraph
at
once
to
San
Francisco
for
Doctor
Nichols
.
No
*NL*
reflection
on
you
,
doctor
,
you
understand
;
but
he
must
have
the
advantage
*NL*
of
every
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
surgeon
smiled
indulgently
.
``
Of
course
I
understand
.
He
deserves
*NL*
all
that
can
be
done
for
him
.
He
must
be
nursed
as
you
would
nurse
a
*NL*
human
being
,
a
sick
child
.
And
do
n't
forget
what
I
told
you
about
*NL*
temperature
.
I
'll
be
back
at
ten
o'clock
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
received
the
nursing
.
Judge
Scott
's
suggestion
of
a
trained
*NL*
nurse
was
indignantly
clamoured
down
by
the
girls
,
who
themselves
*NL*
undertook
the
task
.
And
White
Fang
won
out
on
the
one
chance
in
ten
*NL*
thousand
denied
him
by
the
surgeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
not
to
be
censured
for
his
misjudgment
.
All
his
life
he
*NL*
had
tended
and
operated
on
the
soft
humans
of
civilisation
,
who
lived
*NL*
sheltered
lives
and
had
descended
out
of
many
sheltered
generations
.
*NL*
Compared
with
White
Fang
,
they
were
frail
and
flabby
,
and
clutched
life
*NL*
without
any
strength
in
their
grip
.
White
Fang
had
come
straight
from
*NL*
the
Wild
,
where
the
weak
perish
early
and
shelter
is
vouchsafed
to
none
.
*NL*
In
neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
was
there
any
weakness
,
nor
in
the
*NL*
generations
before
them
.
A
constitution
of
iron
and
the
vitality
of
the
*NL*
Wild
were
White
Fang
's
inheritance
,
and
he
clung
to
life
,
the
whole
of
*NL*
him
and
every
part
of
him
,
in
spirit
and
in
flesh
,
with
the
tenacity
that
*NL*
of
old
belonged
to
all
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bound
down
a
prisoner
,
denied
even
movement
by
the
plaster
casts
and
*NL*
bandages
,
White
Fang
lingered
out
the
weeks
.
He
slept
long
hours
and
*NL*
dreamed
much
,
and
through
his
mind
passed
an
unending
pageant
of
*NL*
Northland
visions
.
All
the
ghosts
of
the
past
arose
and
were
with
him
.
*NL*
Once
again
he
lived
in
the
lair
with
Kiche
,
crept
trembling
to
the
knees
*NL*
of
Grey
Beaver
to
tender
his
allegiance
,
ran
for
his
life
before
Lip-lip
*NL*
and
all
the
howling
bedlam
of
the
puppy-pack
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
again
through
the
silence
,
hunting
his
living
food
through
the
*NL*
months
of
famine
;
and
again
he
ran
at
the
head
of
the
team
,
the
gut-whips
*NL*
of
Mit-sah
and
Grey
Beaver
snapping
behind
,
their
voices
crying
``
Ra
!
*NL*
Raa
!
''
when
they
came
to
a
narrow
passage
and
the
team
closed
together
*NL*
like
a
fan
to
go
through
.
He
lived
again
all
his
days
with
Beauty
Smith
*NL*
and
the
fights
he
had
fought
.
At
such
times
he
whimpered
and
snarled
in
*NL*
his
sleep
,
and
they
that
looked
on
said
that
his
dreams
were
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
one
particular
nightmare
from
which
he
suffered
--
the
*NL*
clanking
,
clanging
monsters
of
electric
cars
that
were
to
him
colossal
*NL*
screaming
lynxes
.
He
would
lie
in
a
screen
of
bushes
,
watching
for
a
*NL*
squirrel
to
venture
far
enough
out
on
the
ground
from
its
tree-refuge
.
*NL*
Then
,
when
he
sprang
out
upon
it
,
it
would
transform
itself
into
an
*NL*
electric
car
,
menacing
and
terrible
,
towering
over
him
like
a
mountain
,
*NL*
screaming
and
clanging
and
spitting
fire
at
him
.
It
was
the
same
when
he
*NL*
challenged
the
hawk
down
out
of
the
sky
.
Down
out
of
the
blue
it
would
*NL*
rush
,
as
it
dropped
upon
him
changing
itself
into
the
ubiquitous
electric
*NL*
car
.
Or
again
,
he
would
be
in
the
pen
of
Beauty
Smith
.
Outside
the
pen
,
*NL*
men
would
be
gathering
,
and
he
knew
that
a
fight
was
on
.
He
watched
the
*NL*
door
for
his
antagonist
to
enter
.
The
door
would
open
,
and
thrust
in
*NL*
upon
him
would
come
the
awful
electric
car
.
A
thousand
times
this
*NL*
occurred
,
and
each
time
the
terror
it
inspired
was
as
vivid
and
great
as
*NL*
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
day
when
the
last
bandage
and
the
last
plaster
cast
were
*NL*
taken
off
.
It
was
a
gala
day
.
All
Sierra
Vista
was
gathered
around
.
The
*NL*
master
rubbed
his
ears
,
and
he
crooned
his
love-growl
.
The
master
's
wife
*NL*
called
him
the
``
Blessed
Wolf
,
''
which
name
was
taken
up
with
acclaim
and
*NL*
all
the
women
called
him
the
Blessed
Wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
rise
to
his
feet
,
and
after
several
attempts
fell
down
from
*NL*
weakness
.
He
had
lain
so
long
that
his
muscles
had
lost
their
cunning
,
*NL*
and
all
the
strength
had
gone
out
of
them
.
He
felt
a
little
shame
*NL*
because
of
his
weakness
,
as
though
,
forsooth
,
he
were
failing
the
gods
in
*NL*
the
service
he
owed
them
.
Because
of
this
he
made
heroic
efforts
to
*NL*
arise
and
at
last
he
stood
on
his
four
legs
,
tottering
and
swaying
back
*NL*
and
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Blessed
Wolf
!
''
chorused
the
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Scott
surveyed
them
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
your
own
mouths
be
it
,
''
he
said
.
``
Just
as
I
contended
right
*NL*
along
.
No
mere
dog
could
have
done
what
he
did
.
He
's
a
wolf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Blessed
Wolf
,
''
amended
the
Judge
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Blessed
Wolf
,
''
agreed
the
Judge
.
``
And
henceforth
that
shall
be
my
*NL*
name
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
have
to
learn
to
walk
again
,
''
said
the
surgeon
;
``
so
he
might
as
*NL*
well
start
in
right
now
.
It
wo
n't
hurt
him
.
Take
him
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
outside
he
went
,
like
a
king
,
with
all
Sierra
Vista
about
him
and
*NL*
tending
on
him
.
He
was
very
weak
,
and
when
he
reached
the
lawn
he
lay
*NL*
down
and
rested
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
procession
started
on
,
little
spurts
of
strength
coming
into
*NL*
White
Fang
's
muscles
as
he
used
them
and
the
blood
began
to
surge
through
*NL*
them
.
The
stables
were
reached
,
and
there
in
the
doorway
,
lay
Collie
,
a
*NL*
half-dozen
pudgy
puppies
playing
about
her
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Fang
looked
on
with
a
wondering
eye
.
Collie
snarled
warningly
at
*NL*
him
,
and
he
was
careful
to
keep
his
distance
.
The
master
with
his
toe
*NL*
helped
one
sprawling
puppy
toward
him
.
He
bristled
suspiciously
,
but
the
*NL*
master
warned
him
that
all
was
well
.
Collie
,
clasped
in
the
arms
of
one
*NL*
of
the
women
,
watched
him
jealously
and
with
a
snarl
warned
him
that
all
*NL*
was
not
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
puppy
sprawled
in
front
of
him
.
He
cocked
his
ears
and
watched
it
*NL*
curiously
.
Then
their
noses
touched
,
and
he
felt
the
warm
little
tongue
*NL*
of
the
puppy
on
his
jowl
.
White
Fang
's
tongue
went
out
,
he
knew
not
why
,
*NL*
and
he
licked
the
puppy
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hand-clapping
and
pleased
cries
from
the
gods
greeted
the
performance
.
He
*NL*
was
surprised
,
and
looked
at
them
in
a
puzzled
way
.
Then
his
weakness
*NL*
asserted
itself
,
and
he
lay
down
,
his
ears
cocked
,
his
head
on
one
side
,
*NL*
as
he
watched
the
puppy
.
The
other
puppies
came
sprawling
toward
him
,
to
*NL*
Collie
's
great
disgust
;
and
he
gravely
permitted
them
to
clamber
and
*NL*
tumble
over
him
.
At
first
,
amid
the
applause
of
the
gods
,
he
betrayed
a
*NL*
trifle
of
his
old
self-consciousness
and
awkwardness
.
This
passed
away
*NL*
as
the
puppies
'
antics
and
mauling
continued
,
and
he
lay
with
half-shut
*NL*
patient
eyes
,
drowsing
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
