--
*NL*
*NL*
TO
Mrs.
Saville
,
England
*NL*
*NL*
You
will
rejoice
to
hear
that
no
disaster
has
accompanied
the
*NL*
commencement
of
an
enterprise
which
you
have
regarded
with
such
evil
*NL*
forebodings
.
I
arrived
here
yesterday
,
and
my
first
task
is
to
assure
*NL*
my
dear
sister
of
my
welfare
and
increasing
confidence
in
the
success
*NL*
of
my
undertaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
already
far
north
of
London
,
and
as
I
walk
in
the
streets
of
*NL*
Petersburgh
,
I
feel
a
cold
northern
breeze
play
upon
my
cheeks
,
which
*NL*
braces
my
nerves
and
fills
me
with
delight
.
Do
you
understand
this
*NL*
feeling
?
This
breeze
,
which
has
travelled
from
the
regions
towards
*NL*
which
I
am
advancing
,
gives
me
a
foretaste
of
those
icy
climes
.
*NL*
Inspirited
by
this
wind
of
promise
,
my
daydreams
become
more
fervent
*NL*
and
vivid
.
I
try
in
vain
to
be
persuaded
that
the
pole
is
the
seat
of
*NL*
frost
and
desolation
;
it
ever
presents
itself
to
my
imagination
as
the
*NL*
region
of
beauty
and
delight
.
There
,
Margaret
,
the
sun
is
forever
*NL*
visible
,
its
broad
disk
just
skirting
the
horizon
and
diffusing
a
*NL*
perpetual
splendour
.
There
--
for
with
your
leave
,
my
sister
,
I
will
put
*NL*
some
trust
in
preceding
navigators
--
there
snow
and
frost
are
banished
;
*NL*
and
,
sailing
over
a
calm
sea
,
we
may
be
wafted
to
a
land
surpassing
in
*NL*
wonders
and
in
beauty
every
region
hitherto
discovered
on
the
habitable
*NL*
globe
.
Its
productions
and
features
may
be
without
example
,
as
the
*NL*
phenomena
of
the
heavenly
bodies
undoubtedly
are
in
those
undiscovered
*NL*
solitudes
.
What
may
not
be
expected
in
a
country
of
eternal
light
?
I
*NL*
may
there
discover
the
wondrous
power
which
attracts
the
needle
and
may
*NL*
regulate
a
thousand
celestial
observations
that
require
only
this
*NL*
voyage
to
render
their
seeming
eccentricities
consistent
forever
.
I
*NL*
shall
satiate
my
ardent
curiosity
with
the
sight
of
a
part
of
the
world
*NL*
never
before
visited
,
and
may
tread
a
land
never
before
imprinted
by
*NL*
the
foot
of
man
.
These
are
my
enticements
,
and
they
are
sufficient
to
*NL*
conquer
all
fear
of
danger
or
death
and
to
induce
me
to
commence
this
*NL*
laborious
voyage
with
the
joy
a
child
feels
when
he
embarks
in
a
little
*NL*
boat
,
with
his
holiday
mates
,
on
an
expedition
of
discovery
up
his
*NL*
native
river
.
But
supposing
all
these
conjectures
to
be
false
,
you
*NL*
can
not
contest
the
inestimable
benefit
which
I
shall
confer
on
all
*NL*
mankind
,
to
the
last
generation
,
by
discovering
a
passage
near
the
pole
*NL*
to
those
countries
,
to
reach
which
at
present
so
many
months
are
*NL*
requisite
;
or
by
ascertaining
the
secret
of
the
magnet
,
which
,
if
at
*NL*
all
possible
,
can
only
be
effected
by
an
undertaking
such
as
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
reflections
have
dispelled
the
agitation
with
which
I
began
my
*NL*
letter
,
and
I
feel
my
heart
glow
with
an
enthusiasm
which
elevates
me
*NL*
to
heaven
,
for
nothing
contributes
so
much
to
tranquillize
the
mind
as
*NL*
a
steady
purpose
--
a
point
on
which
the
soul
may
fix
its
intellectual
*NL*
eye
.
This
expedition
has
been
the
favourite
dream
of
my
early
years
.
I
*NL*
have
read
with
ardour
the
accounts
of
the
various
voyages
which
have
*NL*
been
made
in
the
prospect
of
arriving
at
the
North
Pacific
Ocean
*NL*
through
the
seas
which
surround
the
pole
.
You
may
remember
that
a
*NL*
history
of
all
the
voyages
made
for
purposes
of
discovery
composed
the
*NL*
whole
of
our
good
Uncle
Thomas
'
library
.
My
education
was
neglected
,
*NL*
yet
I
was
passionately
fond
of
reading
.
These
volumes
were
my
study
*NL*
day
and
night
,
and
my
familiarity
with
them
increased
that
regret
which
*NL*
I
had
felt
,
as
a
child
,
on
learning
that
my
father
's
dying
injunction
*NL*
had
forbidden
my
uncle
to
allow
me
to
embark
in
a
seafaring
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
visions
faded
when
I
perused
,
for
the
first
time
,
those
poets
*NL*
whose
effusions
entranced
my
soul
and
lifted
it
to
heaven
.
I
also
*NL*
became
a
poet
and
for
one
year
lived
in
a
paradise
of
my
own
creation
;
*NL*
I
imagined
that
I
also
might
obtain
a
niche
in
the
temple
where
the
*NL*
names
of
Homer
and
Shakespeare
are
consecrated
.
You
are
well
*NL*
acquainted
with
my
failure
and
how
heavily
I
bore
the
disappointment
.
*NL*
But
just
at
that
time
I
inherited
the
fortune
of
my
cousin
,
and
my
*NL*
thoughts
were
turned
into
the
channel
of
their
earlier
bent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
years
have
passed
since
I
resolved
on
my
present
undertaking
.
I
*NL*
can
,
even
now
,
remember
the
hour
from
which
I
dedicated
myself
to
this
*NL*
great
enterprise
.
I
commenced
by
inuring
my
body
to
hardship
.
I
*NL*
accompanied
the
whale-fishers
on
several
expeditions
to
the
North
Sea
;
*NL*
I
voluntarily
endured
cold
,
famine
,
thirst
,
and
want
of
sleep
;
I
often
*NL*
worked
harder
than
the
common
sailors
during
the
day
and
devoted
my
*NL*
nights
to
the
study
of
mathematics
,
the
theory
of
medicine
,
and
those
*NL*
branches
of
physical
science
from
which
a
naval
adventurer
might
derive
*NL*
the
greatest
practical
advantage
.
Twice
I
actually
hired
myself
as
an
*NL*
under-mate
in
a
Greenland
whaler
,
and
acquitted
myself
to
admiration
.
I
*NL*
must
own
I
felt
a
little
proud
when
my
captain
offered
me
the
second
*NL*
dignity
in
the
vessel
and
entreated
me
to
remain
with
the
greatest
*NL*
earnestness
,
so
valuable
did
he
consider
my
services
.
And
now
,
dear
*NL*
Margaret
,
do
I
not
deserve
to
accomplish
some
great
purpose
?
My
life
*NL*
might
have
been
passed
in
ease
and
luxury
,
but
I
preferred
glory
to
*NL*
every
enticement
that
wealth
placed
in
my
path
.
Oh
,
that
some
*NL*
encouraging
voice
would
answer
in
the
affirmative
!
My
courage
and
my
*NL*
resolution
is
firm
;
but
my
hopes
fluctuate
,
and
my
spirits
are
often
*NL*
depressed
.
I
am
about
to
proceed
on
a
long
and
difficult
voyage
,
the
*NL*
emergencies
of
which
will
demand
all
my
fortitude
:
I
am
required
not
*NL*
only
to
raise
the
spirits
of
others
,
but
sometimes
to
sustain
my
own
,
*NL*
when
theirs
are
failing
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
most
favourable
period
for
travelling
in
Russia
.
They
fly
*NL*
quickly
over
the
snow
in
their
sledges
;
the
motion
is
pleasant
,
and
,
in
*NL*
my
opinion
,
far
more
agreeable
than
that
of
an
English
stagecoach
.
The
*NL*
cold
is
not
excessive
,
if
you
are
wrapped
in
furs
--
a
dress
which
I
have
*NL*
already
adopted
,
for
there
is
a
great
difference
between
walking
the
*NL*
deck
and
remaining
seated
motionless
for
hours
,
when
no
exercise
*NL*
prevents
the
blood
from
actually
freezing
in
your
veins
.
I
have
no
*NL*
ambition
to
lose
my
life
on
the
post-road
between
St.
Petersburgh
and
*NL*
Archangel
.
I
shall
depart
for
the
latter
town
in
a
fortnight
or
three
*NL*
weeks
;
and
my
intention
is
to
hire
a
ship
there
,
which
can
easily
be
*NL*
done
by
paying
the
insurance
for
the
owner
,
and
to
engage
as
many
*NL*
sailors
as
I
think
necessary
among
those
who
are
accustomed
to
the
*NL*
whale-fishing
.
I
do
not
intend
to
sail
until
the
month
of
June
;
and
*NL*
when
shall
I
return
?
Ah
,
dear
sister
,
how
can
I
answer
this
question
?
*NL*
If
I
succeed
,
many
,
many
months
,
perhaps
years
,
will
pass
before
you
*NL*
and
I
may
meet
.
If
I
fail
,
you
will
see
me
again
soon
,
or
never
.
*NL*
Farewell
,
my
dear
,
excellent
Margaret
.
Heaven
shower
down
blessings
on
*NL*
you
,
and
save
me
,
that
I
may
again
and
again
testify
my
gratitude
for
*NL*
all
your
love
and
kindness
.

affectionate

Letter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Archangel
,
28th
March
,
17
--
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mrs.
Saville
,
England
*NL*
*NL*
How
slowly
the
time
passes
here
,
encompassed
as
I
am
by
frost
and
snow
!
*NL*
Yet
a
second
step
is
taken
towards
my
enterprise
.
I
have
hired
a
*NL*
vessel
and
am
occupied
in
collecting
my
sailors
;
those
whom
I
have
*NL*
already
engaged
appear
to
be
men
on
whom
I
can
depend
and
are
certainly
*NL*
possessed
of
dauntless
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
have
one
want
which
I
have
never
yet
been
able
to
satisfy
,
and
*NL*
the
absence
of
the
object
of
which
I
now
feel
as
a
most
severe
evil
,
I
*NL*
have
no
friend
,
Margaret
:
when
I
am
glowing
with
the
enthusiasm
of
*NL*
success
,
there
will
be
none
to
participate
my
joy
;
if
I
am
assailed
by
*NL*
disappointment
,
no
one
will
endeavour
to
sustain
me
in
dejection
.
I
*NL*
shall
commit
my
thoughts
to
paper
,
it
is
true
;
but
that
is
a
poor
*NL*
medium
for
the
communication
of
feeling
.
I
desire
the
company
of
a
man
*NL*
who
could
sympathize
with
me
,
whose
eyes
would
reply
to
mine
.
You
may
*NL*
deem
me
romantic
,
my
dear
sister
,
but
I
bitterly
feel
the
want
of
a
*NL*
friend
.
I
have
no
one
near
me
,
gentle
yet
courageous
,
possessed
of
a
*NL*
cultivated
as
well
as
of
a
capacious
mind
,
whose
tastes
are
like
my
*NL*
own
,
to
approve
or
amend
my
plans
.
How
would
such
a
friend
repair
the
*NL*
faults
of
your
poor
brother
!
I
am
too
ardent
in
execution
and
too
*NL*
impatient
of
difficulties
.
But
it
is
a
still
greater
evil
to
me
that
I
*NL*
am
self-educated
:
for
the
first
fourteen
years
of
my
life
I
ran
wild
*NL*
on
a
common
and
read
nothing
but
our
Uncle
Thomas
'
books
of
voyages
.
At
*NL*
that
age
I
became
acquainted
with
the
celebrated
poets
of
our
own
*NL*
country
;
but
it
was
only
when
it
had
ceased
to
be
in
my
power
to
derive
*NL*
its
most
important
benefits
from
such
a
conviction
that
I
perceived
the
*NL*
necessity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
more
languages
than
that
of
my
*NL*
native
country
.
Now
I
am
twenty-eight
and
am
in
reality
more
*NL*
illiterate
than
many
schoolboys
of
fifteen
.
It
is
true
that
I
have
*NL*
thought
more
and
that
my
daydreams
are
more
extended
and
magnificent
,
*NL*
but
they
want
-LRB-
as
the
painters
call
it
-RRB-
KEEPING
;
and
I
greatly
need
a
*NL*
friend
who
would
have
sense
enough
not
to
despise
me
as
romantic
,
and
*NL*
affection
enough
for
me
to
endeavour
to
regulate
my
mind
.
Well
,
these
*NL*
are
useless
complaints
;
I
shall
certainly
find
no
friend
on
the
wide
*NL*
ocean
,
nor
even
here
in
Archangel
,
among
merchants
and
seamen
.
Yet
*NL*
some
feelings
,
unallied
to
the
dross
of
human
nature
,
beat
even
in
*NL*
these
rugged
bosoms
.
My
lieutenant
,
for
instance
,
is
a
man
of
*NL*
wonderful
courage
and
enterprise
;
he
is
madly
desirous
of
glory
,
or
*NL*
rather
,
to
word
my
phrase
more
characteristically
,
of
advancement
in
*NL*
his
profession
.
He
is
an
Englishman
,
and
in
the
midst
of
national
and
*NL*
professional
prejudices
,
unsoftened
by
cultivation
,
retains
some
of
the
*NL*
noblest
endowments
of
humanity
.
I
first
became
acquainted
with
him
on
*NL*
board
a
whale
vessel
;
finding
that
he
was
unemployed
in
this
city
,
I
*NL*
easily
engaged
him
to
assist
in
my
enterprise
.
The
master
is
a
person
*NL*
of
an
excellent
disposition
and
is
remarkable
in
the
ship
for
his
*NL*
gentleness
and
the
mildness
of
his
discipline
.
This
circumstance
,
*NL*
added
to
his
well-known
integrity
and
dauntless
courage
,
made
me
very
*NL*
desirous
to
engage
him
.
A
youth
passed
in
solitude
,
my
best
years
*NL*
spent
under
your
gentle
and
feminine
fosterage
,
has
so
refined
the
*NL*
groundwork
of
my
character
that
I
can
not
overcome
an
intense
distaste
*NL*
to
the
usual
brutality
exercised
on
board
ship
:
I
have
never
believed
*NL*
it
to
be
necessary
,
and
when
I
heard
of
a
mariner
equally
noted
for
his
*NL*
kindliness
of
heart
and
the
respect
and
obedience
paid
to
him
by
his
*NL*
crew
,
I
felt
myself
peculiarly
fortunate
in
being
able
to
secure
his
*NL*
services
.
I
heard
of
him
first
in
rather
a
romantic
manner
,
from
a
*NL*
lady
who
owes
to
him
the
happiness
of
her
life
.
This
,
briefly
,
is
his
*NL*
story
.
Some
years
ago
he
loved
a
young
Russian
lady
of
moderate
*NL*
fortune
,
and
having
amassed
a
considerable
sum
in
prize-money
,
the
*NL*
father
of
the
girl
consented
to
the
match
.
He
saw
his
mistress
once
*NL*
before
the
destined
ceremony
;
but
she
was
bathed
in
tears
,
and
throwing
*NL*
herself
at
his
feet
,
entreated
him
to
spare
her
,
confessing
at
the
same
*NL*
time
that
she
loved
another
,
but
that
he
was
poor
,
and
that
her
father
*NL*
would
never
consent
to
the
union
.
My
generous
friend
reassured
the
*NL*
suppliant
,
and
on
being
informed
of
the
name
of
her
lover
,
instantly
*NL*
abandoned
his
pursuit
.
He
had
already
bought
a
farm
with
his
money
,
on
*NL*
which
he
had
designed
to
pass
the
remainder
of
his
life
;
but
he
*NL*
bestowed
the
whole
on
his
rival
,
together
with
the
remains
of
his
*NL*
prize-money
to
purchase
stock
,
and
then
himself
solicited
the
young
*NL*
woman
's
father
to
consent
to
her
marriage
with
her
lover
.
But
the
old
*NL*
man
decidedly
refused
,
thinking
himself
bound
in
honour
to
my
friend
,
*NL*
who
,
when
he
found
the
father
inexorable
,
quitted
his
country
,
nor
*NL*
returned
until
he
heard
that
his
former
mistress
was
married
according
*NL*
to
her
inclinations
.
``
What
a
noble
fellow
!
''
you
will
exclaim
.
He
is
*NL*
so
;
but
then
he
is
wholly
uneducated
:
he
is
as
silent
as
a
Turk
,
and
a
*NL*
kind
of
ignorant
carelessness
attends
him
,
which
,
while
it
renders
his
*NL*
conduct
the
more
astonishing
,
detracts
from
the
interest
and
sympathy
*NL*
which
otherwise
he
would
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
do
not
suppose
,
because
I
complain
a
little
or
because
I
can
*NL*
conceive
a
consolation
for
my
toils
which
I
may
never
know
,
that
I
am
*NL*
wavering
in
my
resolutions
.
Those
are
as
fixed
as
fate
,
and
my
voyage
*NL*
is
only
now
delayed
until
the
weather
shall
permit
my
embarkation
.
The
*NL*
winter
has
been
dreadfully
severe
,
but
the
spring
promises
well
,
and
it
*NL*
is
considered
as
a
remarkably
early
season
,
so
that
perhaps
I
may
sail
*NL*
sooner
than
I
expected
.
I
shall
do
nothing
rashly
:
you
know
me
*NL*
sufficiently
to
confide
in
my
prudence
and
considerateness
whenever
the
*NL*
safety
of
others
is
committed
to
my
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
describe
to
you
my
sensations
on
the
near
prospect
of
my
*NL*
undertaking
.
It
is
impossible
to
communicate
to
you
a
conception
of
*NL*
the
trembling
sensation
,
half
pleasurable
and
half
fearful
,
with
which
*NL*
I
am
preparing
to
depart
.
I
am
going
to
unexplored
regions
,
to
``
the
*NL*
land
of
mist
and
snow
,
''
but
I
shall
kill
no
albatross
;
therefore
do
not
*NL*
be
alarmed
for
my
safety
or
if
I
should
come
back
to
you
as
worn
and
*NL*
woeful
as
the
``
Ancient
Mariner
.
''
You
will
smile
at
my
allusion
,
but
I
*NL*
will
disclose
a
secret
.
I
have
often
attributed
my
attachment
to
,
my
*NL*
passionate
enthusiasm
for
,
the
dangerous
mysteries
of
ocean
to
that
*NL*
production
of
the
most
imaginative
of
modern
poets
.
There
is
something
*NL*
at
work
in
my
soul
which
I
do
not
understand
.
I
am
practically
*NL*
industrious
--
painstaking
,
a
workman
to
execute
with
perseverance
and
*NL*
labour
--
but
besides
this
there
is
a
love
for
the
marvellous
,
a
belief
*NL*
in
the
marvellous
,
intertwined
in
all
my
projects
,
which
hurries
me
out
*NL*
of
the
common
pathways
of
men
,
even
to
the
wild
sea
and
unvisited
*NL*
regions
I
am
about
to
explore
.
But
to
return
to
dearer
considerations
.
*NL*
Shall
I
meet
you
again
,
after
having
traversed
immense
seas
,
and
*NL*
returned
by
the
most
southern
cape
of
Africa
or
America
?
I
dare
not
*NL*
expect
such
success
,
yet
I
can
not
bear
to
look
on
the
reverse
of
the
*NL*
picture
.
Continue
for
the
present
to
write
to
me
by
every
opportunity
:
*NL*
I
may
receive
your
letters
on
some
occasions
when
I
need
them
most
to
*NL*
support
my
spirits
.
I
love
you
very
tenderly
.
Remember
me
with
*NL*
affection
,
should
you
never
hear
from
me
again
.

affectionate

*NL*
*NL*
To
Mrs.
Saville
,
England
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
Sister
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
write
a
few
lines
in
haste
to
say
that
I
am
safe
--
and
well
advanced
*NL*
on
my
voyage
.
This
letter
will
reach
England
by
a
merchantman
now
on
*NL*
its
homeward
voyage
from
Archangel
;
more
fortunate
than
I
,
who
may
not
*NL*
see
my
native
land
,
perhaps
,
for
many
years
.
I
am
,
however
,
in
good
*NL*
spirits
:
my
men
are
bold
and
apparently
firm
of
purpose
,
nor
do
the
*NL*
floating
sheets
of
ice
that
continually
pass
us
,
indicating
the
dangers
*NL*
of
the
region
towards
which
we
are
advancing
,
appear
to
dismay
them
.
We
*NL*
have
already
reached
a
very
high
latitude
;
but
it
is
the
height
of
*NL*
summer
,
and
although
not
so
warm
as
in
England
,
the
southern
gales
,
*NL*
which
blow
us
speedily
towards
those
shores
which
I
so
ardently
desire
*NL*
to
attain
,
breathe
a
degree
of
renovating
warmth
which
I
had
not
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
incidents
have
hitherto
befallen
us
that
would
make
a
figure
in
a
*NL*
letter
.
One
or
two
stiff
gales
and
the
springing
of
a
leak
are
*NL*
accidents
which
experienced
navigators
scarcely
remember
to
record
,
and
*NL*
I
shall
be
well
content
if
nothing
worse
happen
to
us
during
our
voyage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adieu
,
my
dear
Margaret
.
Be
assured
that
for
my
own
sake
,
as
well
as
*NL*
yours
,
I
will
not
rashly
encounter
danger
.
I
will
be
cool
,
*NL*
persevering
,
and
prudent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
success
SHALL
crown
my
endeavours
.
Wherefore
not
?
Thus
far
I
have
*NL*
gone
,
tracing
a
secure
way
over
the
pathless
seas
,
the
very
stars
*NL*
themselves
being
witnesses
and
testimonies
of
my
triumph
.
Why
not
*NL*
still
proceed
over
the
untamed
yet
obedient
element
?
What
can
stop
the
*NL*
determined
heart
and
resolved
will
of
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
My
swelling
heart
involuntarily
pours
itself
out
thus
.
But
I
must
*NL*
finish
.
Heaven
bless
my
beloved
sister
!

--
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mrs.
Saville
,
England
*NL*
*NL*
So
strange
an
accident
has
happened
to
us
that
I
can
not
forbear
*NL*
recording
it
,
although
it
is
very
probable
that
you
will
see
me
before
*NL*
these
papers
can
come
into
your
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Last
Monday
-LRB-
July
31st
-RRB-
we
were
nearly
surrounded
by
ice
,
which
closed
*NL*
in
the
ship
on
all
sides
,
scarcely
leaving
her
the
sea-room
in
which
*NL*
she
floated
.
Our
situation
was
somewhat
dangerous
,
especially
as
we
*NL*
were
compassed
round
by
a
very
thick
fog
.
We
accordingly
lay
to
,
*NL*
hoping
that
some
change
would
take
place
in
the
atmosphere
and
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
o'clock
the
mist
cleared
away
,
and
we
beheld
,
stretched
out
*NL*
in
every
direction
,
vast
and
irregular
plains
of
ice
,
which
seemed
to
*NL*
have
no
end
.
Some
of
my
comrades
groaned
,
and
my
own
mind
began
to
*NL*
grow
watchful
with
anxious
thoughts
,
when
a
strange
sight
suddenly
*NL*
attracted
our
attention
and
diverted
our
solicitude
from
our
own
*NL*
situation
.
We
perceived
a
low
carriage
,
fixed
on
a
sledge
and
drawn
by
*NL*
dogs
,
pass
on
towards
the
north
,
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
;
a
*NL*
being
which
had
the
shape
of
a
man
,
but
apparently
of
gigantic
stature
,
*NL*
sat
in
the
sledge
and
guided
the
dogs
.
We
watched
the
rapid
progress
*NL*
of
the
traveller
with
our
telescopes
until
he
was
lost
among
the
*NL*
distant
inequalities
of
the
ice
.
This
appearance
excited
our
*NL*
unqualified
wonder
.
We
were
,
as
we
believed
,
many
hundred
miles
from
*NL*
any
land
;
but
this
apparition
seemed
to
denote
that
it
was
not
,
in
*NL*
reality
,
so
distant
as
we
had
supposed
.
Shut
in
,
however
,
by
ice
,
it
*NL*
was
impossible
to
follow
his
track
,
which
we
had
observed
with
the
*NL*
greatest
attention
.
About
two
hours
after
this
occurrence
we
heard
the
*NL*
ground
sea
,
and
before
night
the
ice
broke
and
freed
our
ship
.
We
,
*NL*
however
,
lay
to
until
the
morning
,
fearing
to
encounter
in
the
dark
*NL*
those
large
loose
masses
which
float
about
after
the
breaking
up
of
the
*NL*
ice
.
I
profited
of
this
time
to
rest
for
a
few
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
however
,
as
soon
as
it
was
light
,
I
went
upon
deck
and
*NL*
found
all
the
sailors
busy
on
one
side
of
the
vessel
,
apparently
*NL*
talking
to
someone
in
the
sea
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
a
sledge
,
like
that
we
*NL*
had
seen
before
,
which
had
drifted
towards
us
in
the
night
on
a
large
*NL*
fragment
of
ice
.
Only
one
dog
remained
alive
;
but
there
was
a
human
*NL*
being
within
it
whom
the
sailors
were
persuading
to
enter
the
vessel
.
*NL*
He
was
not
,
as
the
other
traveller
seemed
to
be
,
a
savage
inhabitant
of
*NL*
some
undiscovered
island
,
but
a
European
.
When
I
appeared
on
deck
the
*NL*
master
said
,
``
Here
is
our
captain
,
and
he
will
not
allow
you
to
perish
*NL*
on
the
open
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
perceiving
me
,
the
stranger
addressed
me
in
English
,
although
with
a
*NL*
foreign
accent
.
``
Before
I
come
on
board
your
vessel
,
''
said
he
,
``
will
*NL*
you
have
the
kindness
to
inform
me
whither
you
are
bound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
conceive
my
astonishment
on
hearing
such
a
question
addressed
*NL*
to
me
from
a
man
on
the
brink
of
destruction
and
to
whom
I
should
have
*NL*
supposed
that
my
vessel
would
have
been
a
resource
which
he
would
not
*NL*
have
exchanged
for
the
most
precious
wealth
the
earth
can
afford
.
I
*NL*
replied
,
however
,
that
we
were
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
towards
the
*NL*
northern
pole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
hearing
this
he
appeared
satisfied
and
consented
to
come
on
board
.
*NL*
Good
God
!
Margaret
,
if
you
had
seen
the
man
who
thus
capitulated
for
*NL*
his
safety
,
your
surprise
would
have
been
boundless
.
His
limbs
were
*NL*
nearly
frozen
,
and
his
body
dreadfully
emaciated
by
fatigue
and
*NL*
suffering
.
I
never
saw
a
man
in
so
wretched
a
condition
.
We
attempted
*NL*
to
carry
him
into
the
cabin
,
but
as
soon
as
he
had
quitted
the
fresh
*NL*
air
he
fainted
.
We
accordingly
brought
him
back
to
the
deck
and
*NL*
restored
him
to
animation
by
rubbing
him
with
brandy
and
forcing
him
to
*NL*
swallow
a
small
quantity
.
As
soon
as
he
showed
signs
of
life
we
*NL*
wrapped
him
up
in
blankets
and
placed
him
near
the
chimney
of
the
*NL*
kitchen
stove
.
By
slow
degrees
he
recovered
and
ate
a
little
soup
,
*NL*
which
restored
him
wonderfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
passed
in
this
manner
before
he
was
able
to
speak
,
and
I
often
*NL*
feared
that
his
sufferings
had
deprived
him
of
understanding
.
When
he
*NL*
had
in
some
measure
recovered
,
I
removed
him
to
my
own
cabin
and
*NL*
attended
on
him
as
much
as
my
duty
would
permit
.
I
never
saw
a
more
*NL*
interesting
creature
:
his
eyes
have
generally
an
expression
of
*NL*
wildness
,
and
even
madness
,
but
there
are
moments
when
,
if
anyone
*NL*
performs
an
act
of
kindness
towards
him
or
does
him
any
the
most
*NL*
trifling
service
,
his
whole
countenance
is
lighted
up
,
as
it
were
,
with
*NL*
a
beam
of
benevolence
and
sweetness
that
I
never
saw
equalled
.
But
he
*NL*
is
generally
melancholy
and
despairing
,
and
sometimes
he
gnashes
his
*NL*
teeth
,
as
if
impatient
of
the
weight
of
woes
that
oppresses
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
guest
was
a
little
recovered
I
had
great
trouble
to
keep
off
*NL*
the
men
,
who
wished
to
ask
him
a
thousand
questions
;
but
I
would
not
*NL*
allow
him
to
be
tormented
by
their
idle
curiosity
,
in
a
state
of
body
*NL*
and
mind
whose
restoration
evidently
depended
upon
entire
repose
.
*NL*
Once
,
however
,
the
lieutenant
asked
why
he
had
come
so
far
upon
the
ice
*NL*
in
so
strange
a
vehicle
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
countenance
instantly
assumed
an
aspect
of
the
deepest
gloom
,
and
*NL*
he
replied
,
``
To
seek
one
who
fled
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
the
man
whom
you
pursued
travel
in
the
same
fashion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
fancy
we
have
seen
him
,
for
the
day
before
we
picked
you
up
we
*NL*
saw
some
dogs
drawing
a
sledge
,
with
a
man
in
it
,
across
the
ice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
aroused
the
stranger
's
attention
,
and
he
asked
a
multitude
of
*NL*
questions
concerning
the
route
which
the
demon
,
as
he
called
him
,
had
*NL*
pursued
.
Soon
after
,
when
he
was
alone
with
me
,
he
said
,
``
I
have
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
excited
your
curiosity
,
as
well
as
that
of
these
good
*NL*
people
;
but
you
are
too
considerate
to
make
inquiries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
it
would
indeed
be
very
impertinent
and
inhuman
in
me
to
*NL*
trouble
you
with
any
inquisitiveness
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
you
rescued
me
from
a
strange
and
perilous
situation
;
you
have
*NL*
benevolently
restored
me
to
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
he
inquired
if
I
thought
that
the
breaking
up
of
the
*NL*
ice
had
destroyed
the
other
sledge
.
I
replied
that
I
could
not
answer
*NL*
with
any
degree
of
certainty
,
for
the
ice
had
not
broken
until
near
*NL*
midnight
,
and
the
traveller
might
have
arrived
at
a
place
of
safety
*NL*
before
that
time
;
but
of
this
I
could
not
judge
.
From
this
time
a
new
*NL*
spirit
of
life
animated
the
decaying
frame
of
the
stranger
.
He
*NL*
manifested
the
greatest
eagerness
to
be
upon
deck
to
watch
for
the
*NL*
sledge
which
had
before
appeared
;
but
I
have
persuaded
him
to
remain
in
*NL*
the
cabin
,
for
he
is
far
too
weak
to
sustain
the
rawness
of
the
*NL*
atmosphere
.
I
have
promised
that
someone
should
watch
for
him
and
give
*NL*
him
instant
notice
if
any
new
object
should
appear
in
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
my
journal
of
what
relates
to
this
strange
occurrence
up
to
the
*NL*
present
day
.
The
stranger
has
gradually
improved
in
health
but
is
very
*NL*
silent
and
appears
uneasy
when
anyone
except
myself
enters
his
cabin
.
*NL*
Yet
his
manners
are
so
conciliating
and
gentle
that
the
sailors
are
all
*NL*
interested
in
him
,
although
they
have
had
very
little
communication
*NL*
with
him
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
begin
to
love
him
as
a
brother
,
and
his
*NL*
constant
and
deep
grief
fills
me
with
sympathy
and
compassion
.
He
must
*NL*
have
been
a
noble
creature
in
his
better
days
,
being
even
now
in
wreck
*NL*
so
attractive
and
amiable
.
I
said
in
one
of
my
letters
,
my
dear
*NL*
Margaret
,
that
I
should
find
no
friend
on
the
wide
ocean
;
yet
I
have
*NL*
found
a
man
who
,
before
his
spirit
had
been
broken
by
misery
,
I
should
*NL*
have
been
happy
to
have
possessed
as
the
brother
of
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
continue
my
journal
concerning
the
stranger
at
intervals
,
*NL*
should
I
have
any
fresh
incidents
to
record
.

August
13th

--
*NL*
*NL*
My
affection
for
my
guest
increases
every
day
.
He
excites
at
once
my
*NL*
admiration
and
my
pity
to
an
astonishing
degree
.
How
can
I
see
so
*NL*
noble
a
creature
destroyed
by
misery
without
feeling
the
most
poignant
*NL*
grief
?
He
is
so
gentle
,
yet
so
wise
;
his
mind
is
so
cultivated
,
and
*NL*
when
he
speaks
,
although
his
words
are
culled
with
the
choicest
art
,
*NL*
yet
they
flow
with
rapidity
and
unparalleled
eloquence
.
He
is
now
much
*NL*
recovered
from
his
illness
and
is
continually
on
the
deck
,
apparently
*NL*
watching
for
the
sledge
that
preceded
his
own
.
Yet
,
although
unhappy
,
*NL*
he
is
not
so
utterly
occupied
by
his
own
misery
but
that
he
interests
*NL*
himself
deeply
in
the
projects
of
others
.
He
has
frequently
conversed
*NL*
with
me
on
mine
,
which
I
have
communicated
to
him
without
disguise
.
He
*NL*
entered
attentively
into
all
my
arguments
in
favour
of
my
eventual
*NL*
success
and
into
every
minute
detail
of
the
measures
I
had
taken
to
*NL*
secure
it
.
I
was
easily
led
by
the
sympathy
which
he
evinced
to
use
*NL*
the
language
of
my
heart
,
to
give
utterance
to
the
burning
ardour
of
my
*NL*
soul
and
to
say
,
with
all
the
fervour
that
warmed
me
,
how
gladly
I
*NL*
would
sacrifice
my
fortune
,
my
existence
,
my
every
hope
,
to
the
*NL*
furtherance
of
my
enterprise
.
One
man
's
life
or
death
were
but
a
small
*NL*
price
to
pay
for
the
acquirement
of
the
knowledge
which
I
sought
,
for
*NL*
the
dominion
I
should
acquire
and
transmit
over
the
elemental
foes
of
*NL*
our
race
.
As
I
spoke
,
a
dark
gloom
spread
over
my
listener
's
*NL*
countenance
.
At
first
I
perceived
that
he
tried
to
suppress
his
*NL*
emotion
;
he
placed
his
hands
before
his
eyes
,
and
my
voice
quivered
and
*NL*
failed
me
as
I
beheld
tears
trickle
fast
from
between
his
fingers
;
a
*NL*
groan
burst
from
his
heaving
breast
.
I
paused
;
at
length
he
spoke
,
in
*NL*
broken
accents
:
``
Unhappy
man
!
Do
you
share
my
madness
?
Have
you
*NL*
drunk
also
of
the
intoxicating
draught
?
Hear
me
;
let
me
reveal
my
*NL*
tale
,
and
you
will
dash
the
cup
from
your
lips
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
words
,
you
may
imagine
,
strongly
excited
my
curiosity
;
but
the
*NL*
paroxysm
of
grief
that
had
seized
the
stranger
overcame
his
weakened
*NL*
powers
,
and
many
hours
of
repose
and
tranquil
conversation
were
*NL*
necessary
to
restore
his
composure
.
Having
conquered
the
violence
of
*NL*
his
feelings
,
he
appeared
to
despise
himself
for
being
the
slave
of
*NL*
passion
;
and
quelling
the
dark
tyranny
of
despair
,
he
led
me
again
to
*NL*
converse
concerning
myself
personally
.
He
asked
me
the
history
of
my
*NL*
earlier
years
.
The
tale
was
quickly
told
,
but
it
awakened
various
*NL*
trains
of
reflection
.
I
spoke
of
my
desire
of
finding
a
friend
,
of
my
*NL*
thirst
for
a
more
intimate
sympathy
with
a
fellow
mind
than
had
ever
*NL*
fallen
to
my
lot
,
and
expressed
my
conviction
that
a
man
could
boast
of
*NL*
little
happiness
who
did
not
enjoy
this
blessing
.
``
I
agree
with
you
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
stranger
;
``
we
are
unfashioned
creatures
,
but
half
made
up
,
*NL*
if
one
wiser
,
better
,
dearer
than
ourselves
--
such
a
friend
ought
to
*NL*
be
--
do
not
lend
his
aid
to
perfectionate
our
weak
and
faulty
natures
.
I
*NL*
once
had
a
friend
,
the
most
noble
of
human
creatures
,
and
am
entitled
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
judge
respecting
friendship
.
You
have
hope
,
and
the
*NL*
world
before
you
,
and
have
no
cause
for
despair
.
But
I
--
I
have
lost
*NL*
everything
and
can
not
begin
life
anew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
his
countenance
became
expressive
of
a
calm
,
settled
*NL*
grief
that
touched
me
to
the
heart
.
But
he
was
silent
and
presently
*NL*
retired
to
his
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
broken
in
spirit
as
he
is
,
no
one
can
feel
more
deeply
than
he
*NL*
does
the
beauties
of
nature
.
The
starry
sky
,
the
sea
,
and
every
sight
*NL*
afforded
by
these
wonderful
regions
seem
still
to
have
the
power
of
*NL*
elevating
his
soul
from
earth
.
Such
a
man
has
a
double
existence
:
he
*NL*
may
suffer
misery
and
be
overwhelmed
by
disappointments
,
yet
when
he
*NL*
has
retired
into
himself
,
he
will
be
like
a
celestial
spirit
that
has
a
*NL*
halo
around
him
,
within
whose
circle
no
grief
or
folly
ventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
you
smile
at
the
enthusiasm
I
express
concerning
this
divine
*NL*
wanderer
?
You
would
not
if
you
saw
him
.
You
have
been
tutored
and
*NL*
refined
by
books
and
retirement
from
the
world
,
and
you
are
therefore
*NL*
somewhat
fastidious
;
but
this
only
renders
you
the
more
fit
to
*NL*
appreciate
the
extraordinary
merits
of
this
wonderful
man
.
Sometimes
I
*NL*
have
endeavoured
to
discover
what
quality
it
is
which
he
possesses
that
*NL*
elevates
him
so
immeasurably
above
any
other
person
I
ever
knew
.
I
*NL*
believe
it
to
be
an
intuitive
discernment
,
a
quick
but
never-failing
*NL*
power
of
judgment
,
a
penetration
into
the
causes
of
things
,
unequalled
*NL*
for
clearness
and
precision
;
add
to
this
a
facility
of
expression
and
a
*NL*
voice
whose
varied
intonations
are
soul-subduing
music
.

August

--
*NL*
*NL*
Yesterday
the
stranger
said
to
me
,
``
You
may
easily
perceive
,
Captain
*NL*
Walton
,
that
I
have
suffered
great
and
unparalleled
misfortunes
.
I
had
*NL*
determined
at
one
time
that
the
memory
of
these
evils
should
die
with
*NL*
me
,
but
you
have
won
me
to
alter
my
determination
.
You
seek
for
*NL*
knowledge
and
wisdom
,
as
I
once
did
;
and
I
ardently
hope
that
the
*NL*
gratification
of
your
wishes
may
not
be
a
serpent
to
sting
you
,
as
mine
*NL*
has
been
.
I
do
not
know
that
the
relation
of
my
disasters
will
be
*NL*
useful
to
you
;
yet
,
when
I
reflect
that
you
are
pursuing
the
same
*NL*
course
,
exposing
yourself
to
the
same
dangers
which
have
rendered
me
*NL*
what
I
am
,
I
imagine
that
you
may
deduce
an
apt
moral
from
my
tale
,
one
*NL*
that
may
direct
you
if
you
succeed
in
your
undertaking
and
console
you
*NL*
in
case
of
failure
.
Prepare
to
hear
of
occurrences
which
are
usually
*NL*
deemed
marvellous
.
Were
we
among
the
tamer
scenes
of
nature
I
might
*NL*
fear
to
encounter
your
unbelief
,
perhaps
your
ridicule
;
but
many
things
*NL*
will
appear
possible
in
these
wild
and
mysterious
regions
which
would
*NL*
provoke
the
laughter
of
those
unacquainted
with
the
ever-varied
powers
*NL*
of
nature
;
nor
can
I
doubt
but
that
my
tale
conveys
in
its
series
*NL*
internal
evidence
of
the
truth
of
the
events
of
which
it
is
composed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
easily
imagine
that
I
was
much
gratified
by
the
offered
*NL*
communication
,
yet
I
could
not
endure
that
he
should
renew
his
grief
by
*NL*
a
recital
of
his
misfortunes
.
I
felt
the
greatest
eagerness
to
hear
*NL*
the
promised
narrative
,
partly
from
curiosity
and
partly
from
a
strong
*NL*
desire
to
ameliorate
his
fate
if
it
were
in
my
power
.
I
expressed
*NL*
these
feelings
in
my
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
''
he
replied
,
``
for
your
sympathy
,
but
it
is
useless
;
my
*NL*
fate
is
nearly
fulfilled
.
I
wait
but
for
one
event
,
and
then
I
shall
*NL*
repose
in
peace
.
I
understand
your
feeling
,
''
continued
he
,
perceiving
*NL*
that
I
wished
to
interrupt
him
;
``
but
you
are
mistaken
,
my
friend
,
if
*NL*
thus
you
will
allow
me
to
name
you
;
nothing
can
alter
my
destiny
;
*NL*
listen
to
my
history
,
and
you
will
perceive
how
irrevocably
it
is
*NL*
determined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
told
me
that
he
would
commence
his
narrative
the
next
day
when
*NL*
I
should
be
at
leisure
.
This
promise
drew
from
me
the
warmest
thanks
.
*NL*
I
have
resolved
every
night
,
when
I
am
not
imperatively
occupied
by
my
*NL*
duties
,
to
record
,
as
nearly
as
possible
in
his
own
words
,
what
he
has
*NL*
related
during
the
day
.
If
I
should
be
engaged
,
I
will
at
least
make
*NL*
notes
.
This
manuscript
will
doubtless
afford
you
the
greatest
*NL*
pleasure
;
but
to
me
,
who
know
him
,
and
who
hear
it
from
his
own
*NL*
lips
--
with
what
interest
and
sympathy
shall
I
read
it
in
some
future
*NL*
day
!
Even
now
,
as
I
commence
my
task
,
his
full-toned
voice
swells
in
*NL*
my
ears
;
his
lustrous
eyes
dwell
on
me
with
all
their
melancholy
*NL*
sweetness
;
I
see
his
thin
hand
raised
in
animation
,
while
the
*NL*
lineaments
of
his
face
are
irradiated
by
the
soul
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
and
harrowing
must
be
his
story
,
frightful
the
storm
which
*NL*
embraced
the
gallant
vessel
on
its
course
and
wrecked
it
--
thus
!

Chapter
1
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
by
birth
a
Genevese
,
and
my
family
is
one
of
the
most
*NL*
distinguished
of
that
republic
.
My
ancestors
had
been
for
many
years
*NL*
counsellors
and
syndics
,
and
my
father
had
filled
several
public
*NL*
situations
with
honour
and
reputation
.
He
was
respected
by
all
who
*NL*
knew
him
for
his
integrity
and
indefatigable
attention
to
public
*NL*
business
.
He
passed
his
younger
days
perpetually
occupied
by
the
*NL*
affairs
of
his
country
;
a
variety
of
circumstances
had
prevented
his
*NL*
marrying
early
,
nor
was
it
until
the
decline
of
life
that
he
became
a
*NL*
husband
and
the
father
of
a
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
circumstances
of
his
marriage
illustrate
his
character
,
I
can
not
*NL*
refrain
from
relating
them
.
One
of
his
most
intimate
friends
was
a
*NL*
merchant
who
,
from
a
flourishing
state
,
fell
,
through
numerous
*NL*
mischances
,
into
poverty
.
This
man
,
whose
name
was
Beaufort
,
was
of
a
*NL*
proud
and
unbending
disposition
and
could
not
bear
to
live
in
poverty
*NL*
and
oblivion
in
the
same
country
where
he
had
formerly
been
*NL*
distinguished
for
his
rank
and
magnificence
.
Having
paid
his
debts
,
*NL*
therefore
,
in
the
most
honourable
manner
,
he
retreated
with
his
*NL*
daughter
to
the
town
of
Lucerne
,
where
he
lived
unknown
and
in
*NL*
wretchedness
.
My
father
loved
Beaufort
with
the
truest
friendship
and
*NL*
was
deeply
grieved
by
his
retreat
in
these
unfortunate
circumstances
.
*NL*
He
bitterly
deplored
the
false
pride
which
led
his
friend
to
a
conduct
*NL*
so
little
worthy
of
the
affection
that
united
them
.
He
lost
no
time
in
*NL*
endeavouring
to
seek
him
out
,
with
the
hope
of
persuading
him
to
begin
*NL*
the
world
again
through
his
credit
and
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beaufort
had
taken
effectual
measures
to
conceal
himself
,
and
it
was
ten
*NL*
months
before
my
father
discovered
his
abode
.
Overjoyed
at
this
*NL*
discovery
,
he
hastened
to
the
house
,
which
was
situated
in
a
mean
street
*NL*
near
the
Reuss
.
But
when
he
entered
,
misery
and
despair
alone
welcomed
*NL*
him
.
Beaufort
had
saved
but
a
very
small
sum
of
money
from
the
wreck
of
*NL*
his
fortunes
,
but
it
was
sufficient
to
provide
him
with
sustenance
for
*NL*
some
months
,
and
in
the
meantime
he
hoped
to
procure
some
respectable
*NL*
employment
in
a
merchant
's
house
.
The
interval
was
,
consequently
,
spent
*NL*
in
inaction
;
his
grief
only
became
more
deep
and
rankling
when
he
had
*NL*
leisure
for
reflection
,
and
at
length
it
took
so
fast
hold
of
his
mind
*NL*
that
at
the
end
of
three
months
he
lay
on
a
bed
of
sickness
,
incapable
*NL*
of
any
exertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
daughter
attended
him
with
the
greatest
tenderness
,
but
she
saw
*NL*
with
despair
that
their
little
fund
was
rapidly
decreasing
and
that
*NL*
there
was
no
other
prospect
of
support
.
But
Caroline
Beaufort
*NL*
possessed
a
mind
of
an
uncommon
mould
,
and
her
courage
rose
to
support
*NL*
her
in
her
adversity
.
She
procured
plain
work
;
she
plaited
straw
and
*NL*
by
various
means
contrived
to
earn
a
pittance
scarcely
sufficient
to
*NL*
support
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
months
passed
in
this
manner
.
Her
father
grew
worse
;
her
time
*NL*
was
more
entirely
occupied
in
attending
him
;
her
means
of
subsistence
*NL*
decreased
;
and
in
the
tenth
month
her
father
died
in
her
arms
,
leaving
*NL*
her
an
orphan
and
a
beggar
.
This
last
blow
overcame
her
,
and
she
knelt
*NL*
by
Beaufort
's
coffin
weeping
bitterly
,
when
my
father
entered
the
*NL*
chamber
.
He
came
like
a
protecting
spirit
to
the
poor
girl
,
who
*NL*
committed
herself
to
his
care
;
and
after
the
interment
of
his
friend
he
*NL*
conducted
her
to
Geneva
and
placed
her
under
the
protection
of
a
*NL*
relation
.
Two
years
after
this
event
Caroline
became
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
considerable
difference
between
the
ages
of
my
parents
,
but
*NL*
this
circumstance
seemed
to
unite
them
only
closer
in
bonds
of
devoted
*NL*
affection
.
There
was
a
sense
of
justice
in
my
father
's
upright
mind
*NL*
which
rendered
it
necessary
that
he
should
approve
highly
to
love
*NL*
strongly
.
Perhaps
during
former
years
he
had
suffered
from
the
*NL*
late-discovered
unworthiness
of
one
beloved
and
so
was
disposed
to
set
*NL*
a
greater
value
on
tried
worth
.
There
was
a
show
of
gratitude
and
*NL*
worship
in
his
attachment
to
my
mother
,
differing
wholly
from
the
*NL*
doting
fondness
of
age
,
for
it
was
inspired
by
reverence
for
her
*NL*
virtues
and
a
desire
to
be
the
means
of
,
in
some
degree
,
recompensing
*NL*
her
for
the
sorrows
she
had
endured
,
but
which
gave
inexpressible
grace
*NL*
to
his
behaviour
to
her
.
Everything
was
made
to
yield
to
her
wishes
*NL*
and
her
convenience
.
He
strove
to
shelter
her
,
as
a
fair
exotic
is
*NL*
sheltered
by
the
gardener
,
from
every
rougher
wind
and
to
surround
her
*NL*
with
all
that
could
tend
to
excite
pleasurable
emotion
in
her
soft
and
*NL*
benevolent
mind
.
Her
health
,
and
even
the
tranquillity
of
her
hitherto
*NL*
constant
spirit
,
had
been
shaken
by
what
she
had
gone
through
.
During
*NL*
the
two
years
that
had
elapsed
previous
to
their
marriage
my
father
had
*NL*
gradually
relinquished
all
his
public
functions
;
and
immediately
after
*NL*
their
union
they
sought
the
pleasant
climate
of
Italy
,
and
the
change
*NL*
of
scene
and
interest
attendant
on
a
tour
through
that
land
of
wonders
,
*NL*
as
a
restorative
for
her
weakened
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Italy
they
visited
Germany
and
France
.
I
,
their
eldest
child
,
was
*NL*
born
at
Naples
,
and
as
an
infant
accompanied
them
in
their
rambles
.
I
*NL*
remained
for
several
years
their
only
child
.
Much
as
they
were
*NL*
attached
to
each
other
,
they
seemed
to
draw
inexhaustible
stores
of
*NL*
affection
from
a
very
mine
of
love
to
bestow
them
upon
me
.
My
mother
's
*NL*
tender
caresses
and
my
father
's
smile
of
benevolent
pleasure
while
*NL*
regarding
me
are
my
first
recollections
.
I
was
their
plaything
and
*NL*
their
idol
,
and
something
better
--
their
child
,
the
innocent
and
*NL*
helpless
creature
bestowed
on
them
by
heaven
,
whom
to
bring
up
to
good
,
*NL*
and
whose
future
lot
it
was
in
their
hands
to
direct
to
happiness
or
*NL*
misery
,
according
as
they
fulfilled
their
duties
towards
me
.
With
this
*NL*
deep
consciousness
of
what
they
owed
towards
the
being
to
which
they
*NL*
had
given
life
,
added
to
the
active
spirit
of
tenderness
that
animated
*NL*
both
,
it
may
be
imagined
that
while
during
every
hour
of
my
infant
life
*NL*
I
received
a
lesson
of
patience
,
of
charity
,
and
of
self-control
,
I
was
*NL*
so
guided
by
a
silken
cord
that
all
seemed
but
one
train
of
enjoyment
*NL*
to
me
.
For
a
long
time
I
was
their
only
care
.
My
mother
had
much
*NL*
desired
to
have
a
daughter
,
but
I
continued
their
single
offspring
.
*NL*
When
I
was
about
five
years
old
,
while
making
an
excursion
beyond
the
*NL*
frontiers
of
Italy
,
they
passed
a
week
on
the
shores
of
the
Lake
of
*NL*
Como
.
Their
benevolent
disposition
often
made
them
enter
the
cottages
*NL*
of
the
poor
.
This
,
to
my
mother
,
was
more
than
a
duty
;
it
was
a
*NL*
necessity
,
a
passion
--
remembering
what
she
had
suffered
,
and
how
she
*NL*
had
been
relieved
--
for
her
to
act
in
her
turn
the
guardian
angel
to
the
*NL*
afflicted
.
During
one
of
their
walks
a
poor
cot
in
the
foldings
of
a
*NL*
vale
attracted
their
notice
as
being
singularly
disconsolate
,
while
the
*NL*
number
of
half-clothed
children
gathered
about
it
spoke
of
penury
in
*NL*
its
worst
shape
.
One
day
,
when
my
father
had
gone
by
himself
to
Milan
,
*NL*
my
mother
,
accompanied
by
me
,
visited
this
abode
.
She
found
a
peasant
*NL*
and
his
wife
,
hard
working
,
bent
down
by
care
and
labour
,
distributing
*NL*
a
scanty
meal
to
five
hungry
babes
.
Among
these
there
was
one
which
*NL*
attracted
my
mother
far
above
all
the
rest
.
She
appeared
of
a
*NL*
different
stock
.
The
four
others
were
dark-eyed
,
hardy
little
*NL*
vagrants
;
this
child
was
thin
and
very
fair
.
Her
hair
was
the
*NL*
brightest
living
gold
,
and
despite
the
poverty
of
her
clothing
,
seemed
*NL*
to
set
a
crown
of
distinction
on
her
head
.
Her
brow
was
clear
and
*NL*
ample
,
her
blue
eyes
cloudless
,
and
her
lips
and
the
moulding
of
her
*NL*
face
so
expressive
of
sensibility
and
sweetness
that
none
could
behold
*NL*
her
without
looking
on
her
as
of
a
distinct
species
,
a
being
*NL*
heaven-sent
,
and
bearing
a
celestial
stamp
in
all
her
features
.
The
*NL*
peasant
woman
,
perceiving
that
my
mother
fixed
eyes
of
wonder
and
*NL*
admiration
on
this
lovely
girl
,
eagerly
communicated
her
history
.
She
*NL*
was
not
her
child
,
but
the
daughter
of
a
Milanese
nobleman
.
Her
mother
*NL*
was
a
German
and
had
died
on
giving
her
birth
.
The
infant
had
been
*NL*
placed
with
these
good
people
to
nurse
:
they
were
better
off
then
.
*NL*
They
had
not
been
long
married
,
and
their
eldest
child
was
but
just
*NL*
born
.
The
father
of
their
charge
was
one
of
those
Italians
nursed
in
*NL*
the
memory
of
the
antique
glory
of
Italy
--
one
among
the
schiavi
ognor
*NL*
frementi
,
who
exerted
himself
to
obtain
the
liberty
of
his
country
.
He
*NL*
became
the
victim
of
its
weakness
.
Whether
he
had
died
or
still
*NL*
lingered
in
the
dungeons
of
Austria
was
not
known
.
His
property
was
*NL*
confiscated
;
his
child
became
an
orphan
and
a
beggar
.
She
continued
*NL*
with
her
foster
parents
and
bloomed
in
their
rude
abode
,
fairer
than
a
*NL*
garden
rose
among
dark-leaved
brambles
.
When
my
father
returned
from
*NL*
Milan
,
he
found
playing
with
me
in
the
hall
of
our
villa
a
child
fairer
*NL*
than
pictured
cherub
--
a
creature
who
seemed
to
shed
radiance
from
her
*NL*
looks
and
whose
form
and
motions
were
lighter
than
the
chamois
of
the
*NL*
hills
.
The
apparition
was
soon
explained
.
With
his
permission
my
*NL*
mother
prevailed
on
her
rustic
guardians
to
yield
their
charge
to
her
.
*NL*
They
were
fond
of
the
sweet
orphan
.
Her
presence
had
seemed
a
blessing
*NL*
to
them
,
but
it
would
be
unfair
to
her
to
keep
her
in
poverty
and
want
*NL*
when
Providence
afforded
her
such
powerful
protection
.
They
consulted
*NL*
their
village
priest
,
and
the
result
was
that
Elizabeth
Lavenza
became
*NL*
the
inmate
of
my
parents
'
house
--
my
more
than
sister
--
the
beautiful
and
*NL*
adored
companion
of
all
my
occupations
and
my
pleasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
loved
Elizabeth
.
The
passionate
and
almost
reverential
*NL*
attachment
with
which
all
regarded
her
became
,
while
I
shared
it
,
my
*NL*
pride
and
my
delight
.
On
the
evening
previous
to
her
being
brought
to
*NL*
my
home
,
my
mother
had
said
playfully
,
``
I
have
a
pretty
present
for
my
*NL*
Victor
--
tomorrow
he
shall
have
it
.
''
And
when
,
on
the
morrow
,
she
*NL*
presented
Elizabeth
to
me
as
her
promised
gift
,
I
,
with
childish
*NL*
seriousness
,
interpreted
her
words
literally
and
looked
upon
Elizabeth
*NL*
as
mine
--
mine
to
protect
,
love
,
and
cherish
.
All
praises
bestowed
on
*NL*
her
I
received
as
made
to
a
possession
of
my
own
.
We
called
each
other
*NL*
familiarly
by
the
name
of
cousin
.
No
word
,
no
expression
could
body
*NL*
forth
the
kind
of
relation
in
which
she
stood
to
me
--
my
more
than
*NL*
sister
,
since
till
death
she
was
to
be
mine
only
.

*NL*
Chapter
2
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
brought
up
together
;
there
was
not
quite
a
year
difference
in
*NL*
our
ages
.
I
need
not
say
that
we
were
strangers
to
any
species
of
*NL*
disunion
or
dispute
.
Harmony
was
the
soul
of
our
companionship
,
and
*NL*
the
diversity
and
contrast
that
subsisted
in
our
characters
drew
us
*NL*
nearer
together
.
Elizabeth
was
of
a
calmer
and
more
concentrated
*NL*
disposition
;
but
,
with
all
my
ardour
,
I
was
capable
of
a
more
intense
*NL*
application
and
was
more
deeply
smitten
with
the
thirst
for
knowledge
.
*NL*
She
busied
herself
with
following
the
aerial
creations
of
the
poets
;
*NL*
and
in
the
majestic
and
wondrous
scenes
which
surrounded
our
Swiss
home
*NL*
--
the
sublime
shapes
of
the
mountains
,
the
changes
of
the
seasons
,
*NL*
tempest
and
calm
,
the
silence
of
winter
,
and
the
life
and
turbulence
of
*NL*
our
Alpine
summers
--
she
found
ample
scope
for
admiration
and
delight
.
*NL*
While
my
companion
contemplated
with
a
serious
and
satisfied
spirit
the
*NL*
magnificent
appearances
of
things
,
I
delighted
in
investigating
their
*NL*
causes
.
The
world
was
to
me
a
secret
which
I
desired
to
divine
.
*NL*
Curiosity
,
earnest
research
to
learn
the
hidden
laws
of
nature
,
*NL*
gladness
akin
to
rapture
,
as
they
were
unfolded
to
me
,
are
among
the
*NL*
earliest
sensations
I
can
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
birth
of
a
second
son
,
my
junior
by
seven
years
,
my
parents
gave
*NL*
up
entirely
their
wandering
life
and
fixed
themselves
in
their
native
*NL*
country
.
We
possessed
a
house
in
Geneva
,
and
a
campagne
on
Belrive
,
*NL*
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
,
at
the
distance
of
rather
more
than
a
*NL*
league
from
the
city
.
We
resided
principally
in
the
latter
,
and
the
*NL*
lives
of
my
parents
were
passed
in
considerable
seclusion
.
It
was
my
*NL*
temper
to
avoid
a
crowd
and
to
attach
myself
fervently
to
a
few
.
I
was
*NL*
indifferent
,
therefore
,
to
my
school-fellows
in
general
;
but
I
united
*NL*
myself
in
the
bonds
of
the
closest
friendship
to
one
among
them
.
Henry
*NL*
Clerval
was
the
son
of
a
merchant
of
Geneva
.
He
was
a
boy
of
singular
*NL*
talent
and
fancy
.
He
loved
enterprise
,
hardship
,
and
even
danger
for
*NL*
its
own
sake
.
He
was
deeply
read
in
books
of
chivalry
and
romance
.
He
*NL*
composed
heroic
songs
and
began
to
write
many
a
tale
of
enchantment
and
*NL*
knightly
adventure
.
He
tried
to
make
us
act
plays
and
to
enter
into
*NL*
masquerades
,
in
which
the
characters
were
drawn
from
the
heroes
of
*NL*
Roncesvalles
,
of
the
Round
Table
of
King
Arthur
,
and
the
chivalrous
*NL*
train
who
shed
their
blood
to
redeem
the
holy
sepulchre
from
the
hands
*NL*
of
the
infidels
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
human
being
could
have
passed
a
happier
childhood
than
myself
.
My
*NL*
parents
were
possessed
by
the
very
spirit
of
kindness
and
indulgence
.
*NL*
We
felt
that
they
were
not
the
tyrants
to
rule
our
lot
according
to
*NL*
their
caprice
,
but
the
agents
and
creators
of
all
the
many
delights
*NL*
which
we
enjoyed
.
When
I
mingled
with
other
families
I
distinctly
*NL*
discerned
how
peculiarly
fortunate
my
lot
was
,
and
gratitude
assisted
*NL*
the
development
of
filial
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
temper
was
sometimes
violent
,
and
my
passions
vehement
;
but
by
some
*NL*
law
in
my
temperature
they
were
turned
not
towards
childish
pursuits
*NL*
but
to
an
eager
desire
to
learn
,
and
not
to
learn
all
things
*NL*
indiscriminately
.
I
confess
that
neither
the
structure
of
languages
,
*NL*
nor
the
code
of
governments
,
nor
the
politics
of
various
states
*NL*
possessed
attractions
for
me
.
It
was
the
secrets
of
heaven
and
earth
*NL*
that
I
desired
to
learn
;
and
whether
it
was
the
outward
substance
of
*NL*
things
or
the
inner
spirit
of
nature
and
the
mysterious
soul
of
man
*NL*
that
occupied
me
,
still
my
inquiries
were
directed
to
the
metaphysical
,
*NL*
or
in
its
highest
sense
,
the
physical
secrets
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Clerval
occupied
himself
,
so
to
speak
,
with
the
moral
*NL*
relations
of
things
.
The
busy
stage
of
life
,
the
virtues
of
heroes
,
*NL*
and
the
actions
of
men
were
his
theme
;
and
his
hope
and
his
dream
was
*NL*
to
become
one
among
those
whose
names
are
recorded
in
story
as
the
*NL*
gallant
and
adventurous
benefactors
of
our
species
.
The
saintly
soul
*NL*
of
Elizabeth
shone
like
a
shrine-dedicated
lamp
in
our
peaceful
home
.
*NL*
Her
sympathy
was
ours
;
her
smile
,
her
soft
voice
,
the
sweet
glance
of
*NL*
her
celestial
eyes
,
were
ever
there
to
bless
and
animate
us
.
She
was
*NL*
the
living
spirit
of
love
to
soften
and
attract
;
I
might
have
become
*NL*
sullen
in
my
study
,
rough
through
the
ardour
of
my
nature
,
but
that
*NL*
she
was
there
to
subdue
me
to
a
semblance
of
her
own
gentleness
.
And
*NL*
Clerval
--
could
aught
ill
entrench
on
the
noble
spirit
of
Clerval
?
Yet
*NL*
he
might
not
have
been
so
perfectly
humane
,
so
thoughtful
in
his
*NL*
generosity
,
so
full
of
kindness
and
tenderness
amidst
his
passion
for
*NL*
adventurous
exploit
,
had
she
not
unfolded
to
him
the
real
loveliness
of
*NL*
beneficence
and
made
the
doing
good
the
end
and
aim
of
his
soaring
*NL*
ambition
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
feel
exquisite
pleasure
in
dwelling
on
the
recollections
of
*NL*
childhood
,
before
misfortune
had
tainted
my
mind
and
changed
its
bright
*NL*
visions
of
extensive
usefulness
into
gloomy
and
narrow
reflections
upon
*NL*
self
.
Besides
,
in
drawing
the
picture
of
my
early
days
,
I
also
record
*NL*
those
events
which
led
,
by
insensible
steps
,
to
my
after
tale
of
*NL*
misery
,
for
when
I
would
account
to
myself
for
the
birth
of
that
*NL*
passion
which
afterwards
ruled
my
destiny
I
find
it
arise
,
like
a
*NL*
mountain
river
,
from
ignoble
and
almost
forgotten
sources
;
but
,
*NL*
swelling
as
it
proceeded
,
it
became
the
torrent
which
,
in
its
course
,
*NL*
has
swept
away
all
my
hopes
and
joys
.
Natural
philosophy
is
the
genius
*NL*
that
has
regulated
my
fate
;
I
desire
,
therefore
,
in
this
narration
,
to
*NL*
state
those
facts
which
led
to
my
predilection
for
that
science
.
When
*NL*
I
was
thirteen
years
of
age
we
all
went
on
a
party
of
pleasure
to
the
*NL*
baths
near
Thonon
;
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
obliged
us
to
remain
a
*NL*
day
confined
to
the
inn
.
In
this
house
I
chanced
to
find
a
volume
of
*NL*
the
works
of
Cornelius
Agrippa
.
I
opened
it
with
apathy
;
the
theory
*NL*
which
he
attempts
to
demonstrate
and
the
wonderful
facts
which
he
*NL*
relates
soon
changed
this
feeling
into
enthusiasm
.
A
new
light
seemed
*NL*
to
dawn
upon
my
mind
,
and
bounding
with
joy
,
I
communicated
my
*NL*
discovery
to
my
father
.
My
father
looked
carelessly
at
the
title
page
*NL*
of
my
book
and
said
,
``
Ah
!
Cornelius
Agrippa
!
My
dear
Victor
,
do
not
*NL*
waste
your
time
upon
this
;
it
is
sad
trash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
instead
of
this
remark
,
my
father
had
taken
the
pains
to
explain
to
*NL*
me
that
the
principles
of
Agrippa
had
been
entirely
exploded
and
that
a
*NL*
modern
system
of
science
had
been
introduced
which
possessed
much
*NL*
greater
powers
than
the
ancient
,
because
the
powers
of
the
latter
were
*NL*
chimerical
,
while
those
of
the
former
were
real
and
practical
,
under
*NL*
such
circumstances
I
should
certainly
have
thrown
Agrippa
aside
and
*NL*
have
contented
my
imagination
,
warmed
as
it
was
,
by
returning
with
*NL*
greater
ardour
to
my
former
studies
.
It
is
even
possible
that
the
*NL*
train
of
my
ideas
would
never
have
received
the
fatal
impulse
that
led
*NL*
to
my
ruin
.
But
the
cursory
glance
my
father
had
taken
of
my
volume
by
*NL*
no
means
assured
me
that
he
was
acquainted
with
its
contents
,
and
I
*NL*
continued
to
read
with
the
greatest
avidity
.
When
I
returned
home
my
*NL*
first
care
was
to
procure
the
whole
works
of
this
author
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
of
Paracelsus
and
Albertus
Magnus
.
I
read
and
studied
the
*NL*
wild
fancies
of
these
writers
with
delight
;
they
appeared
to
me
*NL*
treasures
known
to
few
besides
myself
.
I
have
described
myself
as
*NL*
always
having
been
imbued
with
a
fervent
longing
to
penetrate
the
*NL*
secrets
of
nature
.
In
spite
of
the
intense
labour
and
wonderful
*NL*
discoveries
of
modern
philosophers
,
I
always
came
from
my
studies
*NL*
discontented
and
unsatisfied
.
Sir
Isaac
Newton
is
said
to
have
avowed
*NL*
that
he
felt
like
a
child
picking
up
shells
beside
the
great
and
*NL*
unexplored
ocean
of
truth
.
Those
of
his
successors
in
each
branch
of
*NL*
natural
philosophy
with
whom
I
was
acquainted
appeared
even
to
my
boy
's
*NL*
apprehensions
as
tyros
engaged
in
the
same
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
untaught
peasant
beheld
the
elements
around
him
and
was
acquainted
*NL*
with
their
practical
uses
.
The
most
learned
philosopher
knew
little
*NL*
more
.
He
had
partially
unveiled
the
face
of
Nature
,
but
her
immortal
*NL*
lineaments
were
still
a
wonder
and
a
mystery
.
He
might
dissect
,
*NL*
anatomize
,
and
give
names
;
but
,
not
to
speak
of
a
final
cause
,
causes
*NL*
in
their
secondary
and
tertiary
grades
were
utterly
unknown
to
him
.
I
*NL*
had
gazed
upon
the
fortifications
and
impediments
that
seemed
to
keep
*NL*
human
beings
from
entering
the
citadel
of
nature
,
and
rashly
and
*NL*
ignorantly
I
had
repined
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
were
books
,
and
here
were
men
who
had
penetrated
deeper
and
*NL*
knew
more
.
I
took
their
word
for
all
that
they
averred
,
and
I
became
*NL*
their
disciple
.
It
may
appear
strange
that
such
should
arise
in
the
*NL*
eighteenth
century
;
but
while
I
followed
the
routine
of
education
in
*NL*
the
schools
of
Geneva
,
I
was
,
to
a
great
degree
,
self-taught
with
*NL*
regard
to
my
favourite
studies
.
My
father
was
not
scientific
,
and
I
*NL*
was
left
to
struggle
with
a
child
's
blindness
,
added
to
a
student
's
*NL*
thirst
for
knowledge
.
Under
the
guidance
of
my
new
preceptors
I
*NL*
entered
with
the
greatest
diligence
into
the
search
of
the
*NL*
philosopher
's
stone
and
the
elixir
of
life
;
but
the
latter
soon
*NL*
obtained
my
undivided
attention
.
Wealth
was
an
inferior
object
,
but
*NL*
what
glory
would
attend
the
discovery
if
I
could
banish
disease
from
*NL*
the
human
frame
and
render
man
invulnerable
to
any
but
a
violent
death
!
*NL*
Nor
were
these
my
only
visions
.
The
raising
of
ghosts
or
devils
was
a
*NL*
promise
liberally
accorded
by
my
favourite
authors
,
the
fulfilment
of
*NL*
which
I
most
eagerly
sought
;
and
if
my
incantations
were
always
*NL*
unsuccessful
,
I
attributed
the
failure
rather
to
my
own
inexperience
*NL*
and
mistake
than
to
a
want
of
skill
or
fidelity
in
my
instructors
.
And
*NL*
thus
for
a
time
I
was
occupied
by
exploded
systems
,
mingling
,
like
an
*NL*
unadept
,
a
thousand
contradictory
theories
and
floundering
desperately
*NL*
in
a
very
slough
of
multifarious
knowledge
,
guided
by
an
ardent
*NL*
imagination
and
childish
reasoning
,
till
an
accident
again
changed
the
*NL*
current
of
my
ideas
.
When
I
was
about
fifteen
years
old
we
had
retired
*NL*
to
our
house
near
Belrive
,
when
we
witnessed
a
most
violent
and
*NL*
terrible
thunderstorm
.
It
advanced
from
behind
the
mountains
of
Jura
,
*NL*
and
the
thunder
burst
at
once
with
frightful
loudness
from
various
*NL*
quarters
of
the
heavens
.
I
remained
,
while
the
storm
lasted
,
watching
*NL*
its
progress
with
curiosity
and
delight
.
As
I
stood
at
the
door
,
on
a
*NL*
sudden
I
beheld
a
stream
of
fire
issue
from
an
old
and
beautiful
oak
*NL*
which
stood
about
twenty
yards
from
our
house
;
and
so
soon
as
the
*NL*
dazzling
light
vanished
,
the
oak
had
disappeared
,
and
nothing
remained
*NL*
but
a
blasted
stump
.
When
we
visited
it
the
next
morning
,
we
found
the
*NL*
tree
shattered
in
a
singular
manner
.
It
was
not
splintered
by
the
*NL*
shock
,
but
entirely
reduced
to
thin
ribbons
of
wood
.
I
never
beheld
*NL*
anything
so
utterly
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
this
I
was
not
unacquainted
with
the
more
obvious
laws
of
*NL*
electricity
.
On
this
occasion
a
man
of
great
research
in
natural
*NL*
philosophy
was
with
us
,
and
excited
by
this
catastrophe
,
he
entered
on
*NL*
the
explanation
of
a
theory
which
he
had
formed
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
electricity
and
galvanism
,
which
was
at
once
new
and
astonishing
to
me
.
*NL*
All
that
he
said
threw
greatly
into
the
shade
Cornelius
Agrippa
,
*NL*
Albertus
Magnus
,
and
Paracelsus
,
the
lords
of
my
imagination
;
but
by
*NL*
some
fatality
the
overthrow
of
these
men
disinclined
me
to
pursue
my
*NL*
accustomed
studies
.
It
seemed
to
me
as
if
nothing
would
or
could
ever
*NL*
be
known
.
All
that
had
so
long
engaged
my
attention
suddenly
grew
*NL*
despicable
.
By
one
of
those
caprices
of
the
mind
which
we
are
perhaps
*NL*
most
subject
to
in
early
youth
,
I
at
once
gave
up
my
former
*NL*
occupations
,
set
down
natural
history
and
all
its
progeny
as
a
deformed
*NL*
and
abortive
creation
,
and
entertained
the
greatest
disdain
for
a
*NL*
would-be
science
which
could
never
even
step
within
the
threshold
of
*NL*
real
knowledge
.
In
this
mood
of
mind
I
betook
myself
to
the
*NL*
mathematics
and
the
branches
of
study
appertaining
to
that
science
as
*NL*
being
built
upon
secure
foundations
,
and
so
worthy
of
my
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
strangely
are
our
souls
constructed
,
and
by
such
slight
ligaments
*NL*
are
we
bound
to
prosperity
or
ruin
.
When
I
look
back
,
it
seems
to
me
*NL*
as
if
this
almost
miraculous
change
of
inclination
and
will
was
the
*NL*
immediate
suggestion
of
the
guardian
angel
of
my
life
--
the
last
effort
*NL*
made
by
the
spirit
of
preservation
to
avert
the
storm
that
was
even
*NL*
then
hanging
in
the
stars
and
ready
to
envelop
me
.
Her
victory
was
*NL*
announced
by
an
unusual
tranquillity
and
gladness
of
soul
which
*NL*
followed
the
relinquishing
of
my
ancient
and
latterly
tormenting
*NL*
studies
.
It
was
thus
that
I
was
to
be
taught
to
associate
evil
with
*NL*
their
prosecution
,
happiness
with
their
disregard
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
strong
effort
of
the
spirit
of
good
,
but
it
was
ineffectual
.
*NL*
Destiny
was
too
potent
,
and
her
immutable
laws
had
decreed
my
utter
and
*NL*
terrible
destruction
.

Chapter
3
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
attained
the
age
of
seventeen
my
parents
resolved
that
I
*NL*
should
become
a
student
at
the
university
of
Ingolstadt
.
I
had
*NL*
hitherto
attended
the
schools
of
Geneva
,
but
my
father
thought
it
*NL*
necessary
for
the
completion
of
my
education
that
I
should
be
made
*NL*
acquainted
with
other
customs
than
those
of
my
native
country
.
My
*NL*
departure
was
therefore
fixed
at
an
early
date
,
but
before
the
day
*NL*
resolved
upon
could
arrive
,
the
first
misfortune
of
my
life
*NL*
occurred
--
an
omen
,
as
it
were
,
of
my
future
misery
.
Elizabeth
had
*NL*
caught
the
scarlet
fever
;
her
illness
was
severe
,
and
she
was
in
the
*NL*
greatest
danger
.
During
her
illness
many
arguments
had
been
urged
to
*NL*
persuade
my
mother
to
refrain
from
attending
upon
her
.
She
had
at
*NL*
first
yielded
to
our
entreaties
,
but
when
she
heard
that
the
life
of
*NL*
her
favourite
was
menaced
,
she
could
no
longer
control
her
anxiety
.
She
*NL*
attended
her
sickbed
;
her
watchful
attentions
triumphed
over
the
*NL*
malignity
of
the
distemper
--
Elizabeth
was
saved
,
but
the
consequences
*NL*
of
this
imprudence
were
fatal
to
her
preserver
.
On
the
third
day
my
*NL*
mother
sickened
;
her
fever
was
accompanied
by
the
most
alarming
*NL*
symptoms
,
and
the
looks
of
her
medical
attendants
prognosticated
the
*NL*
worst
event
.
On
her
deathbed
the
fortitude
and
benignity
of
this
best
*NL*
of
women
did
not
desert
her
.
She
joined
the
hands
of
Elizabeth
and
*NL*
myself
.
``
My
children
,
''
she
said
,
``
my
firmest
hopes
of
future
happiness
*NL*
were
placed
on
the
prospect
of
your
union
.
This
expectation
will
now
*NL*
be
the
consolation
of
your
father
.
Elizabeth
,
my
love
,
you
must
supply
*NL*
my
place
to
my
younger
children
.
Alas
!
I
regret
that
I
am
taken
from
*NL*
you
;
and
,
happy
and
beloved
as
I
have
been
,
is
it
not
hard
to
quit
you
*NL*
all
?
But
these
are
not
thoughts
befitting
me
;
I
will
endeavour
to
*NL*
resign
myself
cheerfully
to
death
and
will
indulge
a
hope
of
meeting
*NL*
you
in
another
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
died
calmly
,
and
her
countenance
expressed
affection
even
in
death
.
*NL*
I
need
not
describe
the
feelings
of
those
whose
dearest
ties
are
rent
*NL*
by
that
most
irreparable
evil
,
the
void
that
presents
itself
to
the
*NL*
soul
,
and
the
despair
that
is
exhibited
on
the
countenance
.
It
is
so
*NL*
long
before
the
mind
can
persuade
itself
that
she
whom
we
saw
every
day
*NL*
and
whose
very
existence
appeared
a
part
of
our
own
can
have
departed
*NL*
forever
--
that
the
brightness
of
a
beloved
eye
can
have
been
*NL*
extinguished
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
so
familiar
and
dear
to
the
ear
*NL*
can
be
hushed
,
never
more
to
be
heard
.
These
are
the
reflections
of
*NL*
the
first
days
;
but
when
the
lapse
of
time
proves
the
reality
of
the
*NL*
evil
,
then
the
actual
bitterness
of
grief
commences
.
Yet
from
whom
has
*NL*
not
that
rude
hand
rent
away
some
dear
connection
?
And
why
should
I
*NL*
describe
a
sorrow
which
all
have
felt
,
and
must
feel
?
The
time
at
*NL*
length
arrives
when
grief
is
rather
an
indulgence
than
a
necessity
;
and
*NL*
the
smile
that
plays
upon
the
lips
,
although
it
may
be
deemed
a
*NL*
sacrilege
,
is
not
banished
.
My
mother
was
dead
,
but
we
had
still
*NL*
duties
which
we
ought
to
perform
;
we
must
continue
our
course
with
the
*NL*
rest
and
learn
to
think
ourselves
fortunate
whilst
one
remains
whom
the
*NL*
spoiler
has
not
seized
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
departure
for
Ingolstadt
,
which
had
been
deferred
by
these
events
,
*NL*
was
now
again
determined
upon
.
I
obtained
from
my
father
a
respite
of
*NL*
some
weeks
.
It
appeared
to
me
sacrilege
so
soon
to
leave
the
repose
,
*NL*
akin
to
death
,
of
the
house
of
mourning
and
to
rush
into
the
thick
of
*NL*
life
.
I
was
new
to
sorrow
,
but
it
did
not
the
less
alarm
me
.
I
was
*NL*
unwilling
to
quit
the
sight
of
those
that
remained
to
me
,
and
above
*NL*
all
,
I
desired
to
see
my
sweet
Elizabeth
in
some
degree
consoled
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
indeed
veiled
her
grief
and
strove
to
act
the
comforter
to
us
all
.
*NL*
She
looked
steadily
on
life
and
assumed
its
duties
with
courage
and
*NL*
zeal
.
She
devoted
herself
to
those
whom
she
had
been
taught
to
call
*NL*
her
uncle
and
cousins
.
Never
was
she
so
enchanting
as
at
this
time
,
*NL*
when
she
recalled
the
sunshine
of
her
smiles
and
spent
them
upon
us
.
*NL*
She
forgot
even
her
own
regret
in
her
endeavours
to
make
us
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
of
my
departure
at
length
arrived
.
Clerval
spent
the
last
*NL*
evening
with
us
.
He
had
endeavoured
to
persuade
his
father
to
permit
*NL*
him
to
accompany
me
and
to
become
my
fellow
student
,
but
in
vain
.
His
*NL*
father
was
a
narrow-minded
trader
and
saw
idleness
and
ruin
in
the
*NL*
aspirations
and
ambition
of
his
son
.
Henry
deeply
felt
the
misfortune
*NL*
of
being
debarred
from
a
liberal
education
.
He
said
little
,
but
when
*NL*
he
spoke
I
read
in
his
kindling
eye
and
in
his
animated
glance
a
*NL*
restrained
but
firm
resolve
not
to
be
chained
to
the
miserable
details
*NL*
of
commerce
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
late
.
We
could
not
tear
ourselves
away
from
each
other
nor
*NL*
persuade
ourselves
to
say
the
word
``
Farewell
!
''
It
was
said
,
and
we
*NL*
retired
under
the
pretence
of
seeking
repose
,
each
fancying
that
the
*NL*
other
was
deceived
;
but
when
at
morning
's
dawn
I
descended
to
the
*NL*
carriage
which
was
to
convey
me
away
,
they
were
all
there
--
my
father
*NL*
again
to
bless
me
,
Clerval
to
press
my
hand
once
more
,
my
Elizabeth
to
*NL*
renew
her
entreaties
that
I
would
write
often
and
to
bestow
the
last
*NL*
feminine
attentions
on
her
playmate
and
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
threw
myself
into
the
chaise
that
was
to
convey
me
away
and
indulged
*NL*
in
the
most
melancholy
reflections
.
I
,
who
had
ever
been
surrounded
by
*NL*
amiable
companions
,
continually
engaged
in
endeavouring
to
bestow
*NL*
mutual
pleasure
--
I
was
now
alone
.
In
the
university
whither
I
was
*NL*
going
I
must
form
my
own
friends
and
be
my
own
protector
.
My
life
had
*NL*
hitherto
been
remarkably
secluded
and
domestic
,
and
this
had
given
me
*NL*
invincible
repugnance
to
new
countenances
.
I
loved
my
brothers
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
and
Clerval
;
these
were
``
old
familiar
faces
,
''
but
I
believed
*NL*
myself
totally
unfitted
for
the
company
of
strangers
.
Such
were
my
*NL*
reflections
as
I
commenced
my
journey
;
but
as
I
proceeded
,
my
spirits
*NL*
and
hopes
rose
.
I
ardently
desired
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
.
I
*NL*
had
often
,
when
at
home
,
thought
it
hard
to
remain
during
my
youth
*NL*
cooped
up
in
one
place
and
had
longed
to
enter
the
world
and
take
my
*NL*
station
among
other
human
beings
.
Now
my
desires
were
complied
with
,
*NL*
and
it
would
,
indeed
,
have
been
folly
to
repent
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
sufficient
leisure
for
these
and
many
other
reflections
during
my
*NL*
journey
to
Ingolstadt
,
which
was
long
and
fatiguing
.
At
length
the
*NL*
high
white
steeple
of
the
town
met
my
eyes
.
I
alighted
and
was
*NL*
conducted
to
my
solitary
apartment
to
spend
the
evening
as
I
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
I
delivered
my
letters
of
introduction
and
paid
a
*NL*
visit
to
some
of
the
principal
professors
.
Chance
--
or
rather
the
evil
*NL*
influence
,
the
Angel
of
Destruction
,
which
asserted
omnipotent
sway
*NL*
over
me
from
the
moment
I
turned
my
reluctant
steps
from
my
father
's
*NL*
door
--
led
me
first
to
M.
Krempe
,
professor
of
natural
philosophy
.
He
*NL*
was
an
uncouth
man
,
but
deeply
imbued
in
the
secrets
of
his
science
.
He
*NL*
asked
me
several
questions
concerning
my
progress
in
the
different
*NL*
branches
of
science
appertaining
to
natural
philosophy
.
I
replied
*NL*
carelessly
,
and
partly
in
contempt
,
mentioned
the
names
of
my
*NL*
alchemists
as
the
principal
authors
I
had
studied
.
The
professor
*NL*
stared
.
``
Have
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
really
spent
your
time
in
studying
such
*NL*
nonsense
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
``
Every
minute
,
''
continued
M.
Krempe
with
*NL*
warmth
,
``
every
instant
that
you
have
wasted
on
those
books
is
utterly
*NL*
and
entirely
lost
.
You
have
burdened
your
memory
with
exploded
systems
*NL*
and
useless
names
.
Good
God
!
In
what
desert
land
have
you
lived
,
*NL*
where
no
one
was
kind
enough
to
inform
you
that
these
fancies
which
you
*NL*
have
so
greedily
imbibed
are
a
thousand
years
old
and
as
musty
as
they
*NL*
are
ancient
?
I
little
expected
,
in
this
enlightened
and
scientific
*NL*
age
,
to
find
a
disciple
of
Albertus
Magnus
and
Paracelsus
.
My
dear
*NL*
sir
,
you
must
begin
your
studies
entirely
anew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
stepped
aside
and
wrote
down
a
list
of
several
books
*NL*
treating
of
natural
philosophy
which
he
desired
me
to
procure
,
and
*NL*
dismissed
me
after
mentioning
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
following
*NL*
week
he
intended
to
commence
a
course
of
lectures
upon
natural
*NL*
philosophy
in
its
general
relations
,
and
that
M.
Waldman
,
a
fellow
*NL*
professor
,
would
lecture
upon
chemistry
the
alternate
days
that
he
*NL*
omitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
home
not
disappointed
,
for
I
have
said
that
I
had
long
*NL*
considered
those
authors
useless
whom
the
professor
reprobated
;
but
I
*NL*
returned
not
at
all
the
more
inclined
to
recur
to
these
studies
in
any
*NL*
shape
.
M.
Krempe
was
a
little
squat
man
with
a
gruff
voice
and
a
*NL*
repulsive
countenance
;
the
teacher
,
therefore
,
did
not
prepossess
me
in
*NL*
favour
of
his
pursuits
.
In
rather
a
too
philosophical
and
connected
a
*NL*
strain
,
perhaps
,
I
have
given
an
account
of
the
conclusions
I
had
come
*NL*
to
concerning
them
in
my
early
years
.
As
a
child
I
had
not
been
*NL*
content
with
the
results
promised
by
the
modern
professors
of
natural
*NL*
science
.
With
a
confusion
of
ideas
only
to
be
accounted
for
by
my
*NL*
extreme
youth
and
my
want
of
a
guide
on
such
matters
,
I
had
retrod
the
*NL*
steps
of
knowledge
along
the
paths
of
time
and
exchanged
the
*NL*
discoveries
of
recent
inquirers
for
the
dreams
of
forgotten
alchemists
.
*NL*
Besides
,
I
had
a
contempt
for
the
uses
of
modern
natural
philosophy
.
*NL*
It
was
very
different
when
the
masters
of
the
science
sought
*NL*
immortality
and
power
;
such
views
,
although
futile
,
were
grand
;
but
now
*NL*
the
scene
was
changed
.
The
ambition
of
the
inquirer
seemed
to
limit
*NL*
itself
to
the
annihilation
of
those
visions
on
which
my
interest
in
*NL*
science
was
chiefly
founded
.
I
was
required
to
exchange
chimeras
of
*NL*
boundless
grandeur
for
realities
of
little
worth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
my
reflections
during
the
first
two
or
three
days
of
my
*NL*
residence
at
Ingolstadt
,
which
were
chiefly
spent
in
becoming
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
localities
and
the
principal
residents
in
my
new
*NL*
abode
.
But
as
the
ensuing
week
commenced
,
I
thought
of
the
information
*NL*
which
M.
Krempe
had
given
me
concerning
the
lectures
.
And
although
I
*NL*
could
not
consent
to
go
and
hear
that
little
conceited
fellow
deliver
*NL*
sentences
out
of
a
pulpit
,
I
recollected
what
he
had
said
of
M.
*NL*
Waldman
,
whom
I
had
never
seen
,
as
he
had
hitherto
been
out
of
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partly
from
curiosity
and
partly
from
idleness
,
I
went
into
the
*NL*
lecturing
room
,
which
M.
Waldman
entered
shortly
after
.
This
professor
*NL*
was
very
unlike
his
colleague
.
He
appeared
about
fifty
years
of
age
,
*NL*
but
with
an
aspect
expressive
of
the
greatest
benevolence
;
a
few
grey
*NL*
hairs
covered
his
temples
,
but
those
at
the
back
of
his
head
were
*NL*
nearly
black
.
His
person
was
short
but
remarkably
erect
and
his
voice
*NL*
the
sweetest
I
had
ever
heard
.
He
began
his
lecture
by
a
*NL*
recapitulation
of
the
history
of
chemistry
and
the
various
improvements
*NL*
made
by
different
men
of
learning
,
pronouncing
with
fervour
the
names
*NL*
of
the
most
distinguished
discoverers
.
He
then
took
a
cursory
view
of
*NL*
the
present
state
of
the
science
and
explained
many
of
its
elementary
*NL*
terms
.
After
having
made
a
few
preparatory
experiments
,
he
concluded
*NL*
with
a
panegyric
upon
modern
chemistry
,
the
terms
of
which
I
shall
*NL*
never
forget
:
``
The
ancient
teachers
of
this
science
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
promised
impossibilities
and
performed
nothing
.
The
modern
masters
*NL*
promise
very
little
;
they
know
that
metals
can
not
be
transmuted
and
*NL*
that
the
elixir
of
life
is
a
chimera
but
these
philosophers
,
whose
*NL*
hands
seem
only
made
to
dabble
in
dirt
,
and
their
eyes
to
pore
over
the
*NL*
microscope
or
crucible
,
have
indeed
performed
miracles
.
They
penetrate
*NL*
into
the
recesses
of
nature
and
show
how
she
works
in
her
*NL*
hiding-places
.
They
ascend
into
the
heavens
;
they
have
discovered
how
*NL*
the
blood
circulates
,
and
the
nature
of
the
air
we
breathe
.
They
have
*NL*
acquired
new
and
almost
unlimited
powers
;
they
can
command
the
thunders
*NL*
of
heaven
,
mimic
the
earthquake
,
and
even
mock
the
invisible
world
with
*NL*
its
own
shadows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
professor
's
words
--
rather
let
me
say
such
the
words
of
*NL*
the
fate
--
enounced
to
destroy
me
.
As
he
went
on
I
felt
as
if
my
soul
*NL*
were
grappling
with
a
palpable
enemy
;
one
by
one
the
various
keys
were
*NL*
touched
which
formed
the
mechanism
of
my
being
;
chord
after
chord
was
*NL*
sounded
,
and
soon
my
mind
was
filled
with
one
thought
,
one
conception
,
*NL*
one
purpose
.
So
much
has
been
done
,
exclaimed
the
soul
of
*NL*
Frankenstein
--
more
,
far
more
,
will
I
achieve
;
treading
in
the
steps
*NL*
already
marked
,
I
will
pioneer
a
new
way
,
explore
unknown
powers
,
and
*NL*
unfold
to
the
world
the
deepest
mysteries
of
creation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
closed
not
my
eyes
that
night
.
My
internal
being
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
insurrection
and
turmoil
;
I
felt
that
order
would
thence
arise
,
but
I
*NL*
had
no
power
to
produce
it
.
By
degrees
,
after
the
morning
's
dawn
,
*NL*
sleep
came
.
I
awoke
,
and
my
yesternight
's
thoughts
were
as
a
dream
.
*NL*
There
only
remained
a
resolution
to
return
to
my
ancient
studies
and
to
*NL*
devote
myself
to
a
science
for
which
I
believed
myself
to
possess
a
*NL*
natural
talent
.
On
the
same
day
I
paid
M.
Waldman
a
visit
.
His
*NL*
manners
in
private
were
even
more
mild
and
attractive
than
in
public
,
*NL*
for
there
was
a
certain
dignity
in
his
mien
during
his
lecture
which
in
*NL*
his
own
house
was
replaced
by
the
greatest
affability
and
kindness
.
I
*NL*
gave
him
pretty
nearly
the
same
account
of
my
former
pursuits
as
I
had
*NL*
given
to
his
fellow
professor
.
He
heard
with
attention
the
little
*NL*
narration
concerning
my
studies
and
smiled
at
the
names
of
Cornelius
*NL*
Agrippa
and
Paracelsus
,
but
without
the
contempt
that
M.
Krempe
had
*NL*
exhibited
.
He
said
that
``
These
were
men
to
whose
indefatigable
zeal
*NL*
modern
philosophers
were
indebted
for
most
of
the
foundations
of
their
*NL*
knowledge
.
They
had
left
to
us
,
as
an
easier
task
,
to
give
new
names
*NL*
and
arrange
in
connected
classifications
the
facts
which
they
in
a
*NL*
great
degree
had
been
the
instruments
of
bringing
to
light
.
The
*NL*
labours
of
men
of
genius
,
however
erroneously
directed
,
scarcely
ever
*NL*
fail
in
ultimately
turning
to
the
solid
advantage
of
mankind
.
''
I
*NL*
listened
to
his
statement
,
which
was
delivered
without
any
presumption
*NL*
or
affectation
,
and
then
added
that
his
lecture
had
removed
my
*NL*
prejudices
against
modern
chemists
;
I
expressed
myself
in
measured
*NL*
terms
,
with
the
modesty
and
deference
due
from
a
youth
to
his
*NL*
instructor
,
without
letting
escape
-LRB-
inexperience
in
life
would
have
*NL*
made
me
ashamed
-RRB-
any
of
the
enthusiasm
which
stimulated
my
intended
*NL*
labours
.
I
requested
his
advice
concerning
the
books
I
ought
to
*NL*
procure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
happy
,
''
said
M.
Waldman
,
``
to
have
gained
a
disciple
;
and
if
your
*NL*
application
equals
your
ability
,
I
have
no
doubt
of
your
success
.
*NL*
Chemistry
is
that
branch
of
natural
philosophy
in
which
the
greatest
*NL*
improvements
have
been
and
may
be
made
;
it
is
on
that
account
that
I
*NL*
have
made
it
my
peculiar
study
;
but
at
the
same
time
,
I
have
not
*NL*
neglected
the
other
branches
of
science
.
A
man
would
make
but
a
very
*NL*
sorry
chemist
if
he
attended
to
that
department
of
human
knowledge
*NL*
alone
.
If
your
wish
is
to
become
really
a
man
of
science
and
not
*NL*
merely
a
petty
experimentalist
,
I
should
advise
you
to
apply
to
every
*NL*
branch
of
natural
philosophy
,
including
mathematics
.
''
He
then
took
me
*NL*
into
his
laboratory
and
explained
to
me
the
uses
of
his
various
*NL*
machines
,
instructing
me
as
to
what
I
ought
to
procure
and
promising
me
*NL*
the
use
of
his
own
when
I
should
have
advanced
far
enough
in
the
*NL*
science
not
to
derange
their
mechanism
.
He
also
gave
me
the
list
of
*NL*
books
which
I
had
requested
,
and
I
took
my
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
a
day
memorable
to
me
;
it
decided
my
future
destiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
4
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
day
natural
philosophy
,
and
particularly
chemistry
,
in
the
*NL*
most
comprehensive
sense
of
the
term
,
became
nearly
my
sole
occupation
.
*NL*
I
read
with
ardour
those
works
,
so
full
of
genius
and
discrimination
,
*NL*
which
modern
inquirers
have
written
on
these
subjects
.
I
attended
the
*NL*
lectures
and
cultivated
the
acquaintance
of
the
men
of
science
of
the
*NL*
university
,
and
I
found
even
in
M.
Krempe
a
great
deal
of
sound
sense
*NL*
and
real
information
,
combined
,
it
is
true
,
with
a
repulsive
*NL*
physiognomy
and
manners
,
but
not
on
that
account
the
less
valuable
.
In
*NL*
M.
Waldman
I
found
a
true
friend
.
His
gentleness
was
never
tinged
by
*NL*
dogmatism
,
and
his
instructions
were
given
with
an
air
of
frankness
and
*NL*
good
nature
that
banished
every
idea
of
pedantry
.
In
a
thousand
ways
*NL*
he
smoothed
for
me
the
path
of
knowledge
and
made
the
most
abstruse
*NL*
inquiries
clear
and
facile
to
my
apprehension
.
My
application
was
at
*NL*
first
fluctuating
and
uncertain
;
it
gained
strength
as
I
proceeded
and
*NL*
soon
became
so
ardent
and
eager
that
the
stars
often
disappeared
in
the
*NL*
light
of
morning
whilst
I
was
yet
engaged
in
my
laboratory
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
applied
so
closely
,
it
may
be
easily
conceived
that
my
progress
*NL*
was
rapid
.
My
ardour
was
indeed
the
astonishment
of
the
students
,
and
*NL*
my
proficiency
that
of
the
masters
.
Professor
Krempe
often
asked
me
,
*NL*
with
a
sly
smile
,
how
Cornelius
Agrippa
went
on
,
whilst
M.
Waldman
*NL*
expressed
the
most
heartfelt
exultation
in
my
progress
.
Two
years
*NL*
passed
in
this
manner
,
during
which
I
paid
no
visit
to
Geneva
,
but
was
*NL*
engaged
,
heart
and
soul
,
in
the
pursuit
of
some
discoveries
which
I
*NL*
hoped
to
make
.
None
but
those
who
have
experienced
them
can
conceive
*NL*
of
the
enticements
of
science
.
In
other
studies
you
go
as
far
as
*NL*
others
have
gone
before
you
,
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
know
;
but
in
*NL*
a
scientific
pursuit
there
is
continual
food
for
discovery
and
wonder
.
*NL*
A
mind
of
moderate
capacity
which
closely
pursues
one
study
must
*NL*
infallibly
arrive
at
great
proficiency
in
that
study
;
and
I
,
who
*NL*
continually
sought
the
attainment
of
one
object
of
pursuit
and
was
*NL*
solely
wrapped
up
in
this
,
improved
so
rapidly
that
at
the
end
of
two
*NL*
years
I
made
some
discoveries
in
the
improvement
of
some
chemical
*NL*
instruments
,
which
procured
me
great
esteem
and
admiration
at
the
*NL*
university
.
When
I
had
arrived
at
this
point
and
had
become
as
well
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
theory
and
practice
of
natural
philosophy
as
*NL*
depended
on
the
lessons
of
any
of
the
professors
at
Ingolstadt
,
my
*NL*
residence
there
being
no
longer
conducive
to
my
improvements
,
I
thought
*NL*
of
returning
to
my
friends
and
my
native
town
,
when
an
incident
*NL*
happened
that
protracted
my
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
phenomena
which
had
peculiarly
attracted
my
attention
was
*NL*
the
structure
of
the
human
frame
,
and
,
indeed
,
any
animal
endued
with
*NL*
life
.
Whence
,
I
often
asked
myself
,
did
the
principle
of
life
proceed
?
*NL*
It
was
a
bold
question
,
and
one
which
has
ever
been
considered
as
a
*NL*
mystery
;
yet
with
how
many
things
are
we
upon
the
brink
of
becoming
*NL*
acquainted
,
if
cowardice
or
carelessness
did
not
restrain
our
*NL*
inquiries
.
I
revolved
these
circumstances
in
my
mind
and
determined
*NL*
thenceforth
to
apply
myself
more
particularly
to
those
branches
of
*NL*
natural
philosophy
which
relate
to
physiology
.
Unless
I
had
been
*NL*
animated
by
an
almost
supernatural
enthusiasm
,
my
application
to
this
*NL*
study
would
have
been
irksome
and
almost
intolerable
.
To
examine
the
*NL*
causes
of
life
,
we
must
first
have
recourse
to
death
.
I
became
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
science
of
anatomy
,
but
this
was
not
sufficient
;
I
*NL*
must
also
observe
the
natural
decay
and
corruption
of
the
human
body
.
*NL*
In
my
education
my
father
had
taken
the
greatest
precautions
that
my
*NL*
mind
should
be
impressed
with
no
supernatural
horrors
.
I
do
not
ever
*NL*
remember
to
have
trembled
at
a
tale
of
superstition
or
to
have
feared
*NL*
the
apparition
of
a
spirit
.
Darkness
had
no
effect
upon
my
fancy
,
and
*NL*
a
churchyard
was
to
me
merely
the
receptacle
of
bodies
deprived
of
*NL*
life
,
which
,
from
being
the
seat
of
beauty
and
strength
,
had
become
*NL*
food
for
the
worm
.
Now
I
was
led
to
examine
the
cause
and
progress
of
*NL*
this
decay
and
forced
to
spend
days
and
nights
in
vaults
and
*NL*
charnel-houses
.
My
attention
was
fixed
upon
every
object
the
most
*NL*
insupportable
to
the
delicacy
of
the
human
feelings
.
I
saw
how
the
*NL*
fine
form
of
man
was
degraded
and
wasted
;
I
beheld
the
corruption
of
*NL*
death
succeed
to
the
blooming
cheek
of
life
;
I
saw
how
the
worm
*NL*
inherited
the
wonders
of
the
eye
and
brain
.
I
paused
,
examining
and
*NL*
analysing
all
the
minutiae
of
causation
,
as
exemplified
in
the
change
*NL*
from
life
to
death
,
and
death
to
life
,
until
from
the
midst
of
this
*NL*
darkness
a
sudden
light
broke
in
upon
me
--
a
light
so
brilliant
and
*NL*
wondrous
,
yet
so
simple
,
that
while
I
became
dizzy
with
the
immensity
*NL*
of
the
prospect
which
it
illustrated
,
I
was
surprised
that
among
so
*NL*
many
men
of
genius
who
had
directed
their
inquiries
towards
the
same
*NL*
science
,
that
I
alone
should
be
reserved
to
discover
so
astonishing
a
*NL*
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Remember
,
I
am
not
recording
the
vision
of
a
madman
.
The
sun
does
not
*NL*
more
certainly
shine
in
the
heavens
than
that
which
I
now
affirm
is
*NL*
true
.
Some
miracle
might
have
produced
it
,
yet
the
stages
of
the
*NL*
discovery
were
distinct
and
probable
.
After
days
and
nights
of
*NL*
incredible
labour
and
fatigue
,
I
succeeded
in
discovering
the
cause
of
*NL*
generation
and
life
;
nay
,
more
,
I
became
myself
capable
of
bestowing
*NL*
animation
upon
lifeless
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
astonishment
which
I
had
at
first
experienced
on
this
discovery
*NL*
soon
gave
place
to
delight
and
rapture
.
After
so
much
time
spent
in
*NL*
painful
labour
,
to
arrive
at
once
at
the
summit
of
my
desires
was
the
*NL*
most
gratifying
consummation
of
my
toils
.
But
this
discovery
was
so
*NL*
great
and
overwhelming
that
all
the
steps
by
which
I
had
been
*NL*
progressively
led
to
it
were
obliterated
,
and
I
beheld
only
the
result
.
*NL*
What
had
been
the
study
and
desire
of
the
wisest
men
since
the
creation
*NL*
of
the
world
was
now
within
my
grasp
.
Not
that
,
like
a
magic
scene
,
it
*NL*
all
opened
upon
me
at
once
:
the
information
I
had
obtained
was
of
a
*NL*
nature
rather
to
direct
my
endeavours
so
soon
as
I
should
point
them
*NL*
towards
the
object
of
my
search
than
to
exhibit
that
object
already
*NL*
accomplished
.
I
was
like
the
Arabian
who
had
been
buried
with
the
dead
*NL*
and
found
a
passage
to
life
,
aided
only
by
one
glimmering
and
seemingly
*NL*
ineffectual
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
by
your
eagerness
and
the
wonder
and
hope
which
your
eyes
*NL*
express
,
my
friend
,
that
you
expect
to
be
informed
of
the
secret
with
*NL*
which
I
am
acquainted
;
that
can
not
be
;
listen
patiently
until
the
end
*NL*
of
my
story
,
and
you
will
easily
perceive
why
I
am
reserved
upon
that
*NL*
subject
.
I
will
not
lead
you
on
,
unguarded
and
ardent
as
I
then
was
,
*NL*
to
your
destruction
and
infallible
misery
.
Learn
from
me
,
if
not
by
my
*NL*
precepts
,
at
least
by
my
example
,
how
dangerous
is
the
acquirement
of
*NL*
knowledge
and
how
much
happier
that
man
is
who
believes
his
native
town
*NL*
to
be
the
world
,
than
he
who
aspires
to
become
greater
than
his
nature
*NL*
will
allow
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
found
so
astonishing
a
power
placed
within
my
hands
,
I
hesitated
*NL*
a
long
time
concerning
the
manner
in
which
I
should
employ
it
.
*NL*
Although
I
possessed
the
capacity
of
bestowing
animation
,
yet
to
*NL*
prepare
a
frame
for
the
reception
of
it
,
with
all
its
intricacies
of
*NL*
fibres
,
muscles
,
and
veins
,
still
remained
a
work
of
inconceivable
*NL*
difficulty
and
labour
.
I
doubted
at
first
whether
I
should
attempt
the
*NL*
creation
of
a
being
like
myself
,
or
one
of
simpler
organization
;
but
my
*NL*
imagination
was
too
much
exalted
by
my
first
success
to
permit
me
to
*NL*
doubt
of
my
ability
to
give
life
to
an
animal
as
complex
and
wonderful
*NL*
as
man
.
The
materials
at
present
within
my
command
hardly
appeared
*NL*
adequate
to
so
arduous
an
undertaking
,
but
I
doubted
not
that
I
should
*NL*
ultimately
succeed
.
I
prepared
myself
for
a
multitude
of
reverses
;
my
*NL*
operations
might
be
incessantly
baffled
,
and
at
last
my
work
be
*NL*
imperfect
,
yet
when
I
considered
the
improvement
which
every
day
takes
*NL*
place
in
science
and
mechanics
,
I
was
encouraged
to
hope
my
present
*NL*
attempts
would
at
least
lay
the
foundations
of
future
success
.
Nor
*NL*
could
I
consider
the
magnitude
and
complexity
of
my
plan
as
any
*NL*
argument
of
its
impracticability
.
It
was
with
these
feelings
that
I
*NL*
began
the
creation
of
a
human
being
.
As
the
minuteness
of
the
parts
*NL*
formed
a
great
hindrance
to
my
speed
,
I
resolved
,
contrary
to
my
first
*NL*
intention
,
to
make
the
being
of
a
gigantic
stature
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
about
eight
feet
in
height
,
and
proportionably
large
.
After
having
*NL*
formed
this
determination
and
having
spent
some
months
in
successfully
*NL*
collecting
and
arranging
my
materials
,
I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
can
conceive
the
variety
of
feelings
which
bore
me
onwards
,
like
*NL*
a
hurricane
,
in
the
first
enthusiasm
of
success
.
Life
and
death
*NL*
appeared
to
me
ideal
bounds
,
which
I
should
first
break
through
,
and
*NL*
pour
a
torrent
of
light
into
our
dark
world
.
A
new
species
would
bless
*NL*
me
as
its
creator
and
source
;
many
happy
and
excellent
natures
would
*NL*
owe
their
being
to
me
.
No
father
could
claim
the
gratitude
of
his
*NL*
child
so
completely
as
I
should
deserve
theirs
.
Pursuing
these
*NL*
reflections
,
I
thought
that
if
I
could
bestow
animation
upon
lifeless
*NL*
matter
,
I
might
in
process
of
time
-LRB-
although
I
now
found
it
impossible
-RRB-
*NL*
renew
life
where
death
had
apparently
devoted
the
body
to
corruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
supported
my
spirits
,
while
I
pursued
my
undertaking
*NL*
with
unremitting
ardour
.
My
cheek
had
grown
pale
with
study
,
and
my
*NL*
person
had
become
emaciated
with
confinement
.
Sometimes
,
on
the
very
*NL*
brink
of
certainty
,
I
failed
;
yet
still
I
clung
to
the
hope
which
the
*NL*
next
day
or
the
next
hour
might
realize
.
One
secret
which
I
alone
*NL*
possessed
was
the
hope
to
which
I
had
dedicated
myself
;
and
the
moon
*NL*
gazed
on
my
midnight
labours
,
while
,
with
unrelaxed
and
breathless
*NL*
eagerness
,
I
pursued
nature
to
her
hiding-places
.
Who
shall
conceive
*NL*
the
horrors
of
my
secret
toil
as
I
dabbled
among
the
unhallowed
damps
*NL*
of
the
grave
or
tortured
the
living
animal
to
animate
the
lifeless
*NL*
clay
?
My
limbs
now
tremble
,
and
my
eyes
swim
with
the
remembrance
;
but
*NL*
then
a
resistless
and
almost
frantic
impulse
urged
me
forward
;
I
seemed
*NL*
to
have
lost
all
soul
or
sensation
but
for
this
one
pursuit
.
It
was
*NL*
indeed
but
a
passing
trance
,
that
only
made
me
feel
with
renewed
*NL*
acuteness
so
soon
as
,
the
unnatural
stimulus
ceasing
to
operate
,
I
had
*NL*
returned
to
my
old
habits
.
I
collected
bones
from
charnel-houses
and
*NL*
disturbed
,
with
profane
fingers
,
the
tremendous
secrets
of
the
human
*NL*
frame
.
In
a
solitary
chamber
,
or
rather
cell
,
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
*NL*
and
separated
from
all
the
other
apartments
by
a
gallery
and
staircase
,
*NL*
I
kept
my
workshop
of
filthy
creation
;
my
eyeballs
were
starting
from
*NL*
their
sockets
in
attending
to
the
details
of
my
employment
.
The
*NL*
dissecting
room
and
the
slaughter-house
furnished
many
of
my
materials
;
*NL*
and
often
did
my
human
nature
turn
with
loathing
from
my
occupation
,
*NL*
whilst
,
still
urged
on
by
an
eagerness
which
perpetually
increased
,
I
*NL*
brought
my
work
near
to
a
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
months
passed
while
I
was
thus
engaged
,
heart
and
soul
,
in
*NL*
one
pursuit
.
It
was
a
most
beautiful
season
;
never
did
the
fields
*NL*
bestow
a
more
plentiful
harvest
or
the
vines
yield
a
more
luxuriant
*NL*
vintage
,
but
my
eyes
were
insensible
to
the
charms
of
nature
.
And
the
*NL*
same
feelings
which
made
me
neglect
the
scenes
around
me
caused
me
also
*NL*
to
forget
those
friends
who
were
so
many
miles
absent
,
and
whom
I
had
*NL*
not
seen
for
so
long
a
time
.
I
knew
my
silence
disquieted
them
,
and
I
*NL*
well
remembered
the
words
of
my
father
:
``
I
know
that
while
you
are
*NL*
pleased
with
yourself
you
will
think
of
us
with
affection
,
and
we
shall
*NL*
hear
regularly
from
you
.
You
must
pardon
me
if
I
regard
any
*NL*
interruption
in
your
correspondence
as
a
proof
that
your
other
duties
*NL*
are
equally
neglected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
well
therefore
what
would
be
my
father
's
feelings
,
but
I
could
*NL*
not
tear
my
thoughts
from
my
employment
,
loathsome
in
itself
,
but
which
*NL*
had
taken
an
irresistible
hold
of
my
imagination
.
I
wished
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
to
procrastinate
all
that
related
to
my
feelings
of
affection
*NL*
until
the
great
object
,
which
swallowed
up
every
habit
of
my
nature
,
*NL*
should
be
completed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
thought
that
my
father
would
be
unjust
if
he
ascribed
my
neglect
*NL*
to
vice
or
faultiness
on
my
part
,
but
I
am
now
convinced
that
he
was
*NL*
justified
in
conceiving
that
I
should
not
be
altogether
free
from
*NL*
blame
.
A
human
being
in
perfection
ought
always
to
preserve
a
calm
and
*NL*
peaceful
mind
and
never
to
allow
passion
or
a
transitory
desire
to
*NL*
disturb
his
tranquillity
.
I
do
not
think
that
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
*NL*
is
an
exception
to
this
rule
.
If
the
study
to
which
you
apply
yourself
*NL*
has
a
tendency
to
weaken
your
affections
and
to
destroy
your
taste
for
*NL*
those
simple
pleasures
in
which
no
alloy
can
possibly
mix
,
then
that
*NL*
study
is
certainly
unlawful
,
that
is
to
say
,
not
befitting
the
human
*NL*
mind
.
If
this
rule
were
always
observed
;
if
no
man
allowed
any
pursuit
*NL*
whatsoever
to
interfere
with
the
tranquillity
of
his
domestic
*NL*
affections
,
Greece
had
not
been
enslaved
,
Caesar
would
have
spared
his
*NL*
country
,
America
would
have
been
discovered
more
gradually
,
and
the
*NL*
empires
of
Mexico
and
Peru
had
not
been
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
forget
that
I
am
moralizing
in
the
most
interesting
part
of
my
*NL*
tale
,
and
your
looks
remind
me
to
proceed
.
My
father
made
no
reproach
*NL*
in
his
letters
and
only
took
notice
of
my
silence
by
inquiring
into
my
*NL*
occupations
more
particularly
than
before
.
Winter
,
spring
,
and
summer
*NL*
passed
away
during
my
labours
;
but
I
did
not
watch
the
blossom
or
the
*NL*
expanding
leaves
--
sights
which
before
always
yielded
me
supreme
*NL*
delight
--
so
deeply
was
I
engrossed
in
my
occupation
.
The
leaves
of
*NL*
that
year
had
withered
before
my
work
drew
near
to
a
close
,
and
now
*NL*
every
day
showed
me
more
plainly
how
well
I
had
succeeded
.
But
my
*NL*
enthusiasm
was
checked
by
my
anxiety
,
and
I
appeared
rather
like
one
*NL*
doomed
by
slavery
to
toil
in
the
mines
,
or
any
other
unwholesome
trade
*NL*
than
an
artist
occupied
by
his
favourite
employment
.
Every
night
I
was
*NL*
oppressed
by
a
slow
fever
,
and
I
became
nervous
to
a
most
painful
*NL*
degree
;
the
fall
of
a
leaf
startled
me
,
and
I
shunned
my
fellow
*NL*
creatures
as
if
I
had
been
guilty
of
a
crime
.
Sometimes
I
grew
alarmed
*NL*
at
the
wreck
I
perceived
that
I
had
become
;
the
energy
of
my
purpose
*NL*
alone
sustained
me
:
my
labours
would
soon
end
,
and
I
believed
that
*NL*
exercise
and
amusement
would
then
drive
away
incipient
disease
;
and
I
*NL*
promised
myself
both
of
these
when
my
creation
should
be
complete
.

Chapter
5
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
a
dreary
night
of
November
that
I
beheld
the
accomplishment
*NL*
of
my
toils
.
With
an
anxiety
that
almost
amounted
to
agony
,
I
*NL*
collected
the
instruments
of
life
around
me
,
that
I
might
infuse
a
*NL*
spark
of
being
into
the
lifeless
thing
that
lay
at
my
feet
.
It
was
*NL*
already
one
in
the
morning
;
the
rain
pattered
dismally
against
the
*NL*
panes
,
and
my
candle
was
nearly
burnt
out
,
when
,
by
the
glimmer
of
the
*NL*
half-extinguished
light
,
I
saw
the
dull
yellow
eye
of
the
creature
*NL*
open
;
it
breathed
hard
,
and
a
convulsive
motion
agitated
its
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
can
I
describe
my
emotions
at
this
catastrophe
,
or
how
delineate
*NL*
the
wretch
whom
with
such
infinite
pains
and
care
I
had
endeavoured
to
*NL*
form
?
His
limbs
were
in
proportion
,
and
I
had
selected
his
features
as
*NL*
beautiful
.
Beautiful
!
Great
God
!
His
yellow
skin
scarcely
covered
*NL*
the
work
of
muscles
and
arteries
beneath
;
his
hair
was
of
a
lustrous
*NL*
black
,
and
flowing
;
his
teeth
of
a
pearly
whiteness
;
but
these
*NL*
luxuriances
only
formed
a
more
horrid
contrast
with
his
watery
eyes
,
*NL*
that
seemed
almost
of
the
same
colour
as
the
dun-white
sockets
in
which
*NL*
they
were
set
,
his
shrivelled
complexion
and
straight
black
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
different
accidents
of
life
are
not
so
changeable
as
the
feelings
*NL*
of
human
nature
.
I
had
worked
hard
for
nearly
two
years
,
for
the
sole
*NL*
purpose
of
infusing
life
into
an
inanimate
body
.
For
this
I
had
*NL*
deprived
myself
of
rest
and
health
.
I
had
desired
it
with
an
ardour
*NL*
that
far
exceeded
moderation
;
but
now
that
I
had
finished
,
the
beauty
*NL*
of
the
dream
vanished
,
and
breathless
horror
and
disgust
filled
my
*NL*
heart
.
Unable
to
endure
the
aspect
of
the
being
I
had
created
,
I
*NL*
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
continued
a
long
time
traversing
my
*NL*
bed-chamber
,
unable
to
compose
my
mind
to
sleep
.
At
length
lassitude
*NL*
succeeded
to
the
tumult
I
had
before
endured
,
and
I
threw
myself
on
the
*NL*
bed
in
my
clothes
,
endeavouring
to
seek
a
few
moments
of
forgetfulness
.
*NL*
But
it
was
in
vain
;
I
slept
,
indeed
,
but
I
was
disturbed
by
the
wildest
*NL*
dreams
.
I
thought
I
saw
Elizabeth
,
in
the
bloom
of
health
,
walking
in
*NL*
the
streets
of
Ingolstadt
.
Delighted
and
surprised
,
I
embraced
her
,
*NL*
but
as
I
imprinted
the
first
kiss
on
her
lips
,
they
became
livid
with
*NL*
the
hue
of
death
;
her
features
appeared
to
change
,
and
I
thought
that
I
*NL*
held
the
corpse
of
my
dead
mother
in
my
arms
;
a
shroud
enveloped
her
*NL*
form
,
and
I
saw
the
grave-worms
crawling
in
the
folds
of
the
flannel
.
*NL*
I
started
from
my
sleep
with
horror
;
a
cold
dew
covered
my
forehead
,
my
*NL*
teeth
chattered
,
and
every
limb
became
convulsed
;
when
,
by
the
dim
and
*NL*
yellow
light
of
the
moon
,
as
it
forced
its
way
through
the
window
*NL*
shutters
,
I
beheld
the
wretch
--
the
miserable
monster
whom
I
had
*NL*
created
.
He
held
up
the
curtain
of
the
bed
;
and
his
eyes
,
if
eyes
they
*NL*
may
be
called
,
were
fixed
on
me
.
His
jaws
opened
,
and
he
muttered
some
*NL*
inarticulate
sounds
,
while
a
grin
wrinkled
his
cheeks
.
He
might
have
*NL*
spoken
,
but
I
did
not
hear
;
one
hand
was
stretched
out
,
seemingly
to
*NL*
detain
me
,
but
I
escaped
and
rushed
downstairs
.
I
took
refuge
in
the
*NL*
courtyard
belonging
to
the
house
which
I
inhabited
,
where
I
remained
*NL*
during
the
rest
of
the
night
,
walking
up
and
down
in
the
greatest
*NL*
agitation
,
listening
attentively
,
catching
and
fearing
each
sound
as
if
*NL*
it
were
to
announce
the
approach
of
the
demoniacal
corpse
to
which
I
*NL*
had
so
miserably
given
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
No
mortal
could
support
the
horror
of
that
countenance
.
A
mummy
*NL*
again
endued
with
animation
could
not
be
so
hideous
as
that
wretch
.
I
*NL*
had
gazed
on
him
while
unfinished
;
he
was
ugly
then
,
but
when
those
*NL*
muscles
and
joints
were
rendered
capable
of
motion
,
it
became
a
thing
*NL*
such
as
even
Dante
could
not
have
conceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
the
night
wretchedly
.
Sometimes
my
pulse
beat
so
quickly
and
*NL*
hardly
that
I
felt
the
palpitation
of
every
artery
;
at
others
,
I
nearly
*NL*
sank
to
the
ground
through
languor
and
extreme
weakness
.
Mingled
with
*NL*
this
horror
,
I
felt
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
;
dreams
that
had
*NL*
been
my
food
and
pleasant
rest
for
so
long
a
space
were
now
become
a
*NL*
hell
to
me
;
and
the
change
was
so
rapid
,
the
overthrow
so
complete
!
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
,
dismal
and
wet
,
at
length
dawned
and
discovered
to
my
*NL*
sleepless
and
aching
eyes
the
church
of
Ingolstadt
,
its
white
steeple
*NL*
and
clock
,
which
indicated
the
sixth
hour
.
The
porter
opened
the
gates
*NL*
of
the
court
,
which
had
that
night
been
my
asylum
,
and
I
issued
into
*NL*
the
streets
,
pacing
them
with
quick
steps
,
as
if
I
sought
to
avoid
the
*NL*
wretch
whom
I
feared
every
turning
of
the
street
would
present
to
my
*NL*
view
.
I
did
not
dare
return
to
the
apartment
which
I
inhabited
,
but
*NL*
felt
impelled
to
hurry
on
,
although
drenched
by
the
rain
which
poured
*NL*
from
a
black
and
comfortless
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
continued
walking
in
this
manner
for
some
time
,
endeavouring
by
*NL*
bodily
exercise
to
ease
the
load
that
weighed
upon
my
mind
.
I
*NL*
traversed
the
streets
without
any
clear
conception
of
where
I
was
or
*NL*
what
I
was
doing
.
My
heart
palpitated
in
the
sickness
of
fear
,
and
I
*NL*
hurried
on
with
irregular
steps
,
not
daring
to
look
about
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Like
one
who
,
on
a
lonely
road
,
*NL*
Doth
walk
in
fear
and
dread
,
*NL*
And
,
having
once
turned
round
,
walks
on
,
*NL*
And
turns
no
more
his
head
;
*NL*
Because
he
knows
a
frightful
fiend
*NL*
Doth
close
behind
him
tread
.

*NL*
Continuing
thus
,
I
came
at
length
opposite
to
the
inn
at
which
the
*NL*
various
diligences
and
carriages
usually
stopped
.
Here
I
paused
,
I
*NL*
knew
not
why
;
but
I
remained
some
minutes
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
a
coach
*NL*
that
was
coming
towards
me
from
the
other
end
of
the
street
.
As
it
*NL*
drew
nearer
I
observed
that
it
was
the
Swiss
diligence
;
it
stopped
just
*NL*
where
I
was
standing
,
and
on
the
door
being
opened
,
I
perceived
Henry
*NL*
Clerval
,
who
,
on
seeing
me
,
instantly
sprung
out
.
``
My
dear
*NL*
Frankenstein
,
''
exclaimed
he
,
``
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
How
fortunate
*NL*
that
you
should
be
here
at
the
very
moment
of
my
alighting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
equal
my
delight
on
seeing
Clerval
;
his
presence
brought
*NL*
back
to
my
thoughts
my
father
,
Elizabeth
,
and
all
those
scenes
of
home
*NL*
so
dear
to
my
recollection
.
I
grasped
his
hand
,
and
in
a
moment
forgot
*NL*
my
horror
and
misfortune
;
I
felt
suddenly
,
and
for
the
first
time
*NL*
during
many
months
,
calm
and
serene
joy
.
I
welcomed
my
friend
,
*NL*
therefore
,
in
the
most
cordial
manner
,
and
we
walked
towards
my
*NL*
college
.
Clerval
continued
talking
for
some
time
about
our
mutual
*NL*
friends
and
his
own
good
fortune
in
being
permitted
to
come
to
*NL*
Ingolstadt
.
``
You
may
easily
believe
,
''
said
he
,
``
how
great
was
the
*NL*
difficulty
to
persuade
my
father
that
all
necessary
knowledge
was
not
*NL*
comprised
in
the
noble
art
of
book-keeping
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
believe
I
*NL*
left
him
incredulous
to
the
last
,
for
his
constant
answer
to
my
*NL*
unwearied
entreaties
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
Dutch
schoolmaster
in
*NL*
The
Vicar
of
Wakefield
:
'
I
have
ten
thousand
florins
a
year
without
*NL*
Greek
,
I
eat
heartily
without
Greek
.
'
But
his
affection
for
me
at
*NL*
length
overcame
his
dislike
of
learning
,
and
he
has
permitted
me
to
*NL*
undertake
a
voyage
of
discovery
to
the
land
of
knowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gives
me
the
greatest
delight
to
see
you
;
but
tell
me
how
you
left
*NL*
my
father
,
brothers
,
and
Elizabeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
and
very
happy
,
only
a
little
uneasy
that
they
hear
from
*NL*
you
so
seldom
.
By
the
by
,
I
mean
to
lecture
you
a
little
upon
their
*NL*
account
myself
.
But
,
my
dear
Frankenstein
,
''
continued
he
,
stopping
*NL*
short
and
gazing
full
in
my
face
,
``
I
did
not
before
remark
how
very
ill
*NL*
you
appear
;
so
thin
and
pale
;
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
watching
for
*NL*
several
nights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
guessed
right
;
I
have
lately
been
so
deeply
engaged
in
one
*NL*
occupation
that
I
have
not
allowed
myself
sufficient
rest
,
as
you
see
;
*NL*
but
I
hope
,
I
sincerely
hope
,
that
all
these
employments
are
now
at
an
*NL*
end
and
that
I
am
at
length
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
excessively
;
I
could
not
endure
to
think
of
,
and
far
less
to
*NL*
allude
to
,
the
occurrences
of
the
preceding
night
.
I
walked
with
a
*NL*
quick
pace
,
and
we
soon
arrived
at
my
college
.
I
then
reflected
,
and
*NL*
the
thought
made
me
shiver
,
that
the
creature
whom
I
had
left
in
my
*NL*
apartment
might
still
be
there
,
alive
and
walking
about
.
I
dreaded
to
*NL*
behold
this
monster
,
but
I
feared
still
more
that
Henry
should
see
him
.
*NL*
Entreating
him
,
therefore
,
to
remain
a
few
minutes
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
stairs
,
I
darted
up
towards
my
own
room
.
My
hand
was
already
on
the
*NL*
lock
of
the
door
before
I
recollected
myself
.
I
then
paused
,
and
a
*NL*
cold
shivering
came
over
me
.
I
threw
the
door
forcibly
open
,
as
*NL*
children
are
accustomed
to
do
when
they
expect
a
spectre
to
stand
in
*NL*
waiting
for
them
on
the
other
side
;
but
nothing
appeared
.
I
stepped
*NL*
fearfully
in
:
the
apartment
was
empty
,
and
my
bedroom
was
also
freed
*NL*
from
its
hideous
guest
.
I
could
hardly
believe
that
so
great
a
good
*NL*
fortune
could
have
befallen
me
,
but
when
I
became
assured
that
my
enemy
*NL*
had
indeed
fled
,
I
clapped
my
hands
for
joy
and
ran
down
to
Clerval
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
ascended
into
my
room
,
and
the
servant
presently
brought
breakfast
;
*NL*
but
I
was
unable
to
contain
myself
.
It
was
not
joy
only
that
possessed
*NL*
me
;
I
felt
my
flesh
tingle
with
excess
of
sensitiveness
,
and
my
pulse
*NL*
beat
rapidly
.
I
was
unable
to
remain
for
a
single
instant
in
the
same
*NL*
place
;
I
jumped
over
the
chairs
,
clapped
my
hands
,
and
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
Clerval
at
first
attributed
my
unusual
spirits
to
joy
on
his
arrival
,
*NL*
but
when
he
observed
me
more
attentively
,
he
saw
a
wildness
in
my
eyes
*NL*
for
which
he
could
not
account
,
and
my
loud
,
unrestrained
,
heartless
*NL*
laughter
frightened
and
astonished
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Victor
,
''
cried
he
,
``
what
,
for
God
's
sake
,
is
the
matter
?
Do
*NL*
not
laugh
in
that
manner
.
How
ill
you
are
!
What
is
the
cause
of
all
*NL*
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
ask
me
,
''
cried
I
,
putting
my
hands
before
my
eyes
,
for
I
*NL*
thought
I
saw
the
dreaded
spectre
glide
into
the
room
;
``
HE
can
tell
.
*NL*
Oh
,
save
me
!
Save
me
!
''
I
imagined
that
the
monster
seized
me
;
I
*NL*
struggled
furiously
and
fell
down
in
a
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Clerval
!
What
must
have
been
his
feelings
?
A
meeting
,
which
he
*NL*
anticipated
with
such
joy
,
so
strangely
turned
to
bitterness
.
But
I
*NL*
was
not
the
witness
of
his
grief
,
for
I
was
lifeless
and
did
not
*NL*
recover
my
senses
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
commencement
of
a
nervous
fever
which
confined
me
for
*NL*
several
months
.
During
all
that
time
Henry
was
my
only
nurse
.
I
*NL*
afterwards
learned
that
,
knowing
my
father
's
advanced
age
and
unfitness
*NL*
for
so
long
a
journey
,
and
how
wretched
my
sickness
would
make
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
he
spared
them
this
grief
by
concealing
the
extent
of
my
*NL*
disorder
.
He
knew
that
I
could
not
have
a
more
kind
and
attentive
*NL*
nurse
than
himself
;
and
,
firm
in
the
hope
he
felt
of
my
recovery
,
he
*NL*
did
not
doubt
that
,
instead
of
doing
harm
,
he
performed
the
kindest
*NL*
action
that
he
could
towards
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
in
reality
very
ill
,
and
surely
nothing
but
the
unbounded
and
*NL*
unremitting
attentions
of
my
friend
could
have
restored
me
to
life
.
*NL*
The
form
of
the
monster
on
whom
I
had
bestowed
existence
was
forever
*NL*
before
my
eyes
,
and
I
raved
incessantly
concerning
him
.
Doubtless
my
*NL*
words
surprised
Henry
;
he
at
first
believed
them
to
be
the
wanderings
*NL*
of
my
disturbed
imagination
,
but
the
pertinacity
with
which
I
*NL*
continually
recurred
to
the
same
subject
persuaded
him
that
my
disorder
*NL*
indeed
owed
its
origin
to
some
uncommon
and
terrible
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
very
slow
degrees
,
and
with
frequent
relapses
that
alarmed
and
*NL*
grieved
my
friend
,
I
recovered
.
I
remember
the
first
time
I
became
*NL*
capable
of
observing
outward
objects
with
any
kind
of
pleasure
,
I
*NL*
perceived
that
the
fallen
leaves
had
disappeared
and
that
the
young
*NL*
buds
were
shooting
forth
from
the
trees
that
shaded
my
window
.
It
was
*NL*
a
divine
spring
,
and
the
season
contributed
greatly
to
my
*NL*
convalescence
.
I
felt
also
sentiments
of
joy
and
affection
revive
in
*NL*
my
bosom
;
my
gloom
disappeared
,
and
in
a
short
time
I
became
as
*NL*
cheerful
as
before
I
was
attacked
by
the
fatal
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
Clerval
,
''
exclaimed
I
,
``
how
kind
,
how
very
good
you
are
to
me
.
*NL*
This
whole
winter
,
instead
of
being
spent
in
study
,
as
you
promised
*NL*
yourself
,
has
been
consumed
in
my
sick
room
.
How
shall
I
ever
repay
*NL*
you
?
I
feel
the
greatest
remorse
for
the
disappointment
of
which
I
*NL*
have
been
the
occasion
,
but
you
will
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
repay
me
entirely
if
you
do
not
discompose
yourself
,
but
get
*NL*
well
as
fast
as
you
can
;
and
since
you
appear
in
such
good
spirits
,
I
*NL*
may
speak
to
you
on
one
subject
,
may
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
.
One
subject
!
What
could
it
be
?
Could
he
allude
to
an
*NL*
object
on
whom
I
dared
not
even
think
?
``
Compose
yourself
,
''
said
*NL*
Clerval
,
who
observed
my
change
of
colour
,
``
I
will
not
mention
it
if
it
*NL*
agitates
you
;
but
your
father
and
cousin
would
be
very
happy
if
they
*NL*
received
a
letter
from
you
in
your
own
handwriting
.
They
hardly
know
*NL*
how
ill
you
have
been
and
are
uneasy
at
your
long
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
,
my
dear
Henry
?
How
could
you
suppose
that
my
first
*NL*
thought
would
not
fly
towards
those
dear
,
dear
friends
whom
I
love
and
*NL*
who
are
so
deserving
of
my
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
is
your
present
temper
,
my
friend
,
you
will
perhaps
be
glad
to
*NL*
see
a
letter
that
has
been
lying
here
some
days
for
you
;
it
is
from
*NL*
your
cousin

I
believe
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
Clerval
then
put
the
following
letter
into
my
hands
.
It
was
from
my
*NL*
own
Elizabeth
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
Cousin
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
ill
,
very
ill
,
and
even
the
constant
letters
of
dear
*NL*
kind
Henry
are
not
sufficient
to
reassure
me
on
your
account
.
You
are
*NL*
forbidden
to
write
--
to
hold
a
pen
;
yet
one
word
from
you
,
dear
Victor
,
*NL*
is
necessary
to
calm
our
apprehensions
.
For
a
long
time
I
have
thought
*NL*
that
each
post
would
bring
this
line
,
and
my
persuasions
have
*NL*
restrained
my
uncle
from
undertaking
a
journey
to
Ingolstadt
.
I
have
*NL*
prevented
his
encountering
the
inconveniences
and
perhaps
dangers
of
so
*NL*
long
a
journey
,
yet
how
often
have
I
regretted
not
being
able
to
*NL*
perform
it
myself
!
I
figure
to
myself
that
the
task
of
attending
on
*NL*
your
sickbed
has
devolved
on
some
mercenary
old
nurse
,
who
could
never
*NL*
guess
your
wishes
nor
minister
to
them
with
the
care
and
affection
of
*NL*
your
poor
cousin
.
Yet
that
is
over
now
:
Clerval
writes
that
indeed
*NL*
you
are
getting
better
.
I
eagerly
hope
that
you
will
confirm
this
*NL*
intelligence
soon
in
your
own
handwriting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
well
--
and
return
to
us
.
You
will
find
a
happy
,
cheerful
home
and
*NL*
friends
who
love
you
dearly
.
Your
father
's
health
is
vigorous
,
and
he
*NL*
asks
but
to
see
you
,
but
to
be
assured
that
you
are
well
;
and
not
a
*NL*
care
will
ever
cloud
his
benevolent
countenance
.
How
pleased
you
would
*NL*
be
to
remark
the
improvement
of
our
Ernest
!
He
is
now
sixteen
and
full
*NL*
of
activity
and
spirit
.
He
is
desirous
to
be
a
true
Swiss
and
to
enter
*NL*
into
foreign
service
,
but
we
can
not
part
with
him
,
at
least
until
his
*NL*
elder
brother
returns
to
us
.
My
uncle
is
not
pleased
with
the
idea
of
*NL*
a
military
career
in
a
distant
country
,
but
Ernest
never
had
your
*NL*
powers
of
application
.
He
looks
upon
study
as
an
odious
fetter
;
his
*NL*
time
is
spent
in
the
open
air
,
climbing
the
hills
or
rowing
on
the
*NL*
lake
.
I
fear
that
he
will
become
an
idler
unless
we
yield
the
point
*NL*
and
permit
him
to
enter
on
the
profession
which
he
has
selected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
alteration
,
except
the
growth
of
our
dear
children
,
has
taken
*NL*
place
since
you
left
us
.
The
blue
lake
and
snow-clad
mountains
--
they
*NL*
never
change
;
and
I
think
our
placid
home
and
our
contented
hearts
are
*NL*
regulated
by
the
same
immutable
laws
.
My
trifling
occupations
take
up
*NL*
my
time
and
amuse
me
,
and
I
am
rewarded
for
any
exertions
by
seeing
*NL*
none
but
happy
,
kind
faces
around
me
.
Since
you
left
us
,
but
one
*NL*
change
has
taken
place
in
our
little
household
.
Do
you
remember
on
*NL*
what
occasion
Justine
Moritz
entered
our
family
?
Probably
you
do
not
;
*NL*
I
will
relate
her
history
,
therefore
in
a
few
words
.
Madame
Moritz
,
*NL*
her
mother
,
was
a
widow
with
four
children
,
of
whom
Justine
was
the
*NL*
third
.
This
girl
had
always
been
the
favourite
of
her
father
,
but
*NL*
through
a
strange
perversity
,
her
mother
could
not
endure
her
,
and
*NL*
after
the
death
of
M.
Moritz
,
treated
her
very
ill
.
My
aunt
observed
*NL*
this
,
and
when
Justine
was
twelve
years
of
age
,
prevailed
on
her
mother
*NL*
to
allow
her
to
live
at
our
house
.
The
republican
institutions
of
our
*NL*
country
have
produced
simpler
and
happier
manners
than
those
which
*NL*
prevail
in
the
great
monarchies
that
surround
it
.
Hence
there
is
less
*NL*
distinction
between
the
several
classes
of
its
inhabitants
;
and
the
*NL*
lower
orders
,
being
neither
so
poor
nor
so
despised
,
their
manners
are
*NL*
more
refined
and
moral
.
A
servant
in
Geneva
does
not
mean
the
same
*NL*
thing
as
a
servant
in
France
and
England
.
Justine
,
thus
received
in
*NL*
our
family
,
learned
the
duties
of
a
servant
,
a
condition
which
,
in
our
*NL*
fortunate
country
,
does
not
include
the
idea
of
ignorance
and
a
*NL*
sacrifice
of
the
dignity
of
a
human
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Justine
,
you
may
remember
,
was
a
great
favourite
of
yours
;
and
I
*NL*
recollect
you
once
remarked
that
if
you
were
in
an
ill
humour
,
one
*NL*
glance
from
Justine
could
dissipate
it
,
for
the
same
reason
that
*NL*
Ariosto
gives
concerning
the
beauty
of
Angelica
--
she
looked
so
*NL*
frank-hearted
and
happy
.
My
aunt
conceived
a
great
attachment
for
her
,
*NL*
by
which
she
was
induced
to
give
her
an
education
superior
to
that
*NL*
which
she
had
at
first
intended
.
This
benefit
was
fully
repaid
;
*NL*
Justine
was
the
most
grateful
little
creature
in
the
world
:
I
do
not
*NL*
mean
that
she
made
any
professions
I
never
heard
one
pass
her
lips
,
but
*NL*
you
could
see
by
her
eyes
that
she
almost
adored
her
protectress
.
*NL*
Although
her
disposition
was
gay
and
in
many
respects
inconsiderate
,
*NL*
yet
she
paid
the
greatest
attention
to
every
gesture
of
my
aunt
.
She
*NL*
thought
her
the
model
of
all
excellence
and
endeavoured
to
imitate
her
*NL*
phraseology
and
manners
,
so
that
even
now
she
often
reminds
me
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
dearest
aunt
died
every
one
was
too
much
occupied
in
their
own
*NL*
grief
to
notice
poor
Justine
,
who
had
attended
her
during
her
illness
*NL*
with
the
most
anxious
affection
.
Poor
Justine
was
very
ill
;
but
other
*NL*
trials
were
reserved
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
by
one
,
her
brothers
and
sister
died
;
and
her
mother
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
her
neglected
daughter
,
was
left
childless
.
The
*NL*
conscience
of
the
woman
was
troubled
;
she
began
to
think
that
the
*NL*
deaths
of
her
favourites
was
a
judgement
from
heaven
to
chastise
her
*NL*
partiality
.
She
was
a
Roman
Catholic
;
and
I
believe
her
confessor
*NL*
confirmed
the
idea
which
she
had
conceived
.
Accordingly
,
a
few
months
*NL*
after
your
departure
for
Ingolstadt
,
Justine
was
called
home
by
her
*NL*
repentant
mother
.
Poor
girl
!
She
wept
when
she
quitted
our
house
;
she
*NL*
was
much
altered
since
the
death
of
my
aunt
;
grief
had
given
softness
*NL*
and
a
winning
mildness
to
her
manners
,
which
had
before
been
remarkable
*NL*
for
vivacity
.
Nor
was
her
residence
at
her
mother
's
house
of
a
nature
*NL*
to
restore
her
gaiety
.
The
poor
woman
was
very
vacillating
in
her
*NL*
repentance
.
She
sometimes
begged
Justine
to
forgive
her
unkindness
,
*NL*
but
much
oftener
accused
her
of
having
caused
the
deaths
of
her
*NL*
brothers
and
sister
.
Perpetual
fretting
at
length
threw
Madame
Moritz
*NL*
into
a
decline
,
which
at
first
increased
her
irritability
,
but
she
is
*NL*
now
at
peace
for
ever
.
She
died
on
the
first
approach
of
cold
weather
,
*NL*
at
the
beginning
of
this
last
winter
.
Justine
has
just
returned
to
us
;
*NL*
and
I
assure
you
I
love
her
tenderly
.
She
is
very
clever
and
gentle
,
*NL*
and
extremely
pretty
;
as
I
mentioned
before
,
her
mien
and
her
*NL*
expression
continually
remind
me
of
my
dear
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
also
a
few
words
to
you
,
my
dear
cousin
,
of
little
darling
*NL*
William
.
I
wish
you
could
see
him
;
he
is
very
tall
of
his
age
,
with
*NL*
sweet
laughing
blue
eyes
,
dark
eyelashes
,
and
curling
hair
.
When
he
*NL*
smiles
,
two
little
dimples
appear
on
each
cheek
,
which
are
rosy
with
*NL*
health
.
He
has
already
had
one
or
two
little
WIVES
,
but
Louisa
Biron
*NL*
is
his
favourite
,
a
pretty
little
girl
of
five
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
dear
Victor
,
I
dare
say
you
wish
to
be
indulged
in
a
little
*NL*
gossip
concerning
the
good
people
of
Geneva
.
The
pretty
Miss
Mansfield
*NL*
has
already
received
the
congratulatory
visits
on
her
approaching
*NL*
marriage
with
a
young
Englishman
,
John
Melbourne
,
Esq.
.
Her
ugly
*NL*
sister
,
Manon
,
married
M.
Duvillard
,
the
rich
banker
,
last
autumn
.
Your
*NL*
favourite
schoolfellow
,
Louis
Manoir
,
has
suffered
several
misfortunes
*NL*
since
the
departure
of
Clerval
from
Geneva
.
But
he
has
already
*NL*
recovered
his
spirits
,
and
is
reported
to
be
on
the
point
of
marrying
a
*NL*
lively
pretty
Frenchwoman
,
Madame
Tavernier
.
She
is
a
widow
,
and
much
*NL*
older
than
Manoir
;
but
she
is
very
much
admired
,
and
a
favourite
with
*NL*
everybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
written
myself
into
better
spirits
,
dear
cousin
;
but
my
anxiety
*NL*
returns
upon
me
as
I
conclude
.
Write
,
dearest
Victor
,
--
one
line

one
*NL*
word
will
be
a
blessing
to
us

Ten
thousand
thanks
to
Henry
for
his
*NL*
kindness
,
his
affection
,
and
his
many
letters
;
we
are
sincerely
*NL*
grateful
.
Adieu
!
my
cousin
;
take
care
of
your
self
;
and
,
I
entreat
*NL*
you
,
write

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
Elizabeth
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
when
I
had
read
her
letter
:
``
I
*NL*
will
write
instantly
and
relieve
them
from
the
anxiety
they
must
feel
.
''
*NL*
I
wrote
,
and
this
exertion
greatly
fatigued
me
;
but
my
convalescence
*NL*
had
commenced
,
and
proceeded
regularly
.
In
another
fortnight
I
was
*NL*
able
to
leave
my
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
my
first
duties
on
my
recovery
was
to
introduce
Clerval
to
the
*NL*
several
professors
of
the
university
.
In
doing
this
,
I
underwent
a
*NL*
kind
of
rough
usage
,
ill
befitting
the
wounds
that
my
mind
had
*NL*
sustained
.
Ever
since
the
fatal
night
,
the
end
of
my
labours
,
and
the
*NL*
beginning
of
my
misfortunes
,
I
had
conceived
a
violent
antipathy
even
*NL*
to
the
name
of
natural
philosophy
.
When
I
was
otherwise
quite
restored
*NL*
to
health
,
the
sight
of
a
chemical
instrument
would
renew
all
the
agony
*NL*
of
my
nervous
symptoms
.
Henry
saw
this
,
and
had
removed
all
my
*NL*
apparatus
from
my
view
.
He
had
also
changed
my
apartment
;
for
he
*NL*
perceived
that
I
had
acquired
a
dislike
for
the
room
which
had
*NL*
previously
been
my
laboratory
.
But
these
cares
of
Clerval
were
made
of
*NL*
no
avail
when
I
visited
the
professors
.
M.
Waldman
inflicted
torture
*NL*
when
he
praised
,
with
kindness
and
warmth
,
the
astonishing
progress
I
*NL*
had
made
in
the
sciences
.
He
soon
perceived
that
I
disliked
the
*NL*
subject
;
but
not
guessing
the
real
cause
,
he
attributed
my
feelings
to
*NL*
modesty
,
and
changed
the
subject
from
my
improvement
,
to
the
science
*NL*
itself
,
with
a
desire
,
as
I
evidently
saw
,
of
drawing
me
out
.
What
*NL*
could
I
do
?
He
meant
to
please
,
and
he
tormented
me
.
I
felt
as
if
he
*NL*
had
placed
carefully
,
one
by
one
,
in
my
view
those
instruments
which
*NL*
were
to
be
afterwards
used
in
putting
me
to
a
slow
and
cruel
death
.
I
*NL*
writhed
under
his
words
,
yet
dared
not
exhibit
the
pain
I
felt
.
*NL*
Clerval
,
whose
eyes
and
feelings
were
always
quick
in
discerning
the
*NL*
sensations
of
others
,
declined
the
subject
,
alleging
,
in
excuse
,
his
*NL*
total
ignorance
;
and
the
conversation
took
a
more
general
turn
.
I
*NL*
thanked
my
friend
from
my
heart
,
but
I
did
not
speak
.
I
saw
plainly
*NL*
that
he
was
surprised
,
but
he
never
attempted
to
draw
my
secret
from
*NL*
me
;
and
although
I
loved
him
with
a
mixture
of
affection
and
reverence
*NL*
that
knew
no
bounds
,
yet
I
could
never
persuade
myself
to
confide
in
*NL*
him
that
event
which
was
so
often
present
to
my
recollection
,
but
which
*NL*
I
feared
the
detail
to
another
would
only
impress
more
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Krempe
was
not
equally
docile
;
and
in
my
condition
at
that
time
,
of
*NL*
almost
insupportable
sensitiveness
,
his
harsh
blunt
encomiums
gave
me
*NL*
even
more
pain
than
the
benevolent
approbation
of
M.
Waldman
.
``
D
--
n
*NL*
the
fellow
!
''
cried
he
;
``
why
,
M.
Clerval
,
I
assure
you
he
has
outstript
*NL*
us
all
.
Ay
,
stare
if
you
please
;
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
.
A
*NL*
youngster
who
,
but
a
few
years
ago
,
believed
in
Cornelius
Agrippa
as
*NL*
firmly
as
in
the
gospel
,
has
now
set
himself
at
the
head
of
the
*NL*
university
;
and
if
he
is
not
soon
pulled
down
,
we
shall
all
be
out
of
*NL*
countenance
.
--
Ay
,
ay
,
''
continued
he
,
observing
my
face
expressive
of
*NL*
suffering
,
``
M.
Frankenstein
is
modest
;
an
excellent
quality
in
a
young
*NL*
man
.
Young
men
should
be
diffident
of
themselves
,
you
know
,
M.
*NL*
Clerval
:
I
was
myself
when
young
;
but
that
wears
out
in
a
very
short
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Krempe
had
now
commenced
an
eulogy
on
himself
,
which
happily
turned
*NL*
the
conversation
from
a
subject
that
was
so
annoying
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clerval
had
never
sympathized
in
my
tastes
for
natural
science
;
and
his
*NL*
literary
pursuits
differed
wholly
from
those
which
had
occupied
me
.
He
*NL*
came
to
the
university
with
the
design
of
making
himself
complete
*NL*
master
of
the
oriental
languages
,
and
thus
he
should
open
a
field
for
*NL*
the
plan
of
life
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
.
Resolved
to
pursue
no
*NL*
inglorious
career
,
he
turned
his
eyes
toward
the
East
,
as
affording
*NL*
scope
for
his
spirit
of
enterprise
.
The
Persian
,
Arabic
,
and
Sanskrit
*NL*
languages
engaged
his
attention
,
and
I
was
easily
induced
to
enter
on
*NL*
the
same
studies
.
Idleness
had
ever
been
irksome
to
me
,
and
now
that
I
*NL*
wished
to
fly
from
reflection
,
and
hated
my
former
studies
,
I
felt
*NL*
great
relief
in
being
the
fellow-pupil
with
my
friend
,
and
found
not
*NL*
only
instruction
but
consolation
in
the
works
of
the
orientalists
.
I
*NL*
did
not
,
like
him
,
attempt
a
critical
knowledge
of
their
dialects
,
for
*NL*
I
did
not
contemplate
making
any
other
use
of
them
than
temporary
*NL*
amusement
.
I
read
merely
to
understand
their
meaning
,
and
they
well
*NL*
repaid
my
labours
.
Their
melancholy
is
soothing
,
and
their
joy
*NL*
elevating
,
to
a
degree
I
never
experienced
in
studying
the
authors
of
*NL*
any
other
country
.
When
you
read
their
writings
,
life
appears
to
*NL*
consist
in
a
warm
sun
and
a
garden
of
roses
,
--
in
the
smiles
and
frowns
*NL*
of
a
fair
enemy
,
and
the
fire
that
consumes
your
own
heart
.
How
*NL*
different
from
the
manly
and
heroical
poetry
of
Greece
and
Rome
!
*NL*
*NL*
Summer
passed
away
in
these
occupations
,
and
my
return
to
Geneva
was
*NL*
fixed
for
the
latter
end
of
autumn
;
but
being
delayed
by
several
*NL*
accidents
,
winter
and
snow
arrived
,
the
roads
were
deemed
impassable
,
*NL*
and
my
journey
was
retarded
until
the
ensuing
spring
.
I
felt
this
*NL*
delay
very
bitterly
;
for
I
longed
to
see
my
native
town
and
my
beloved
*NL*
friends
.
My
return
had
only
been
delayed
so
long
,
from
an
*NL*
unwillingness
to
leave
Clerval
in
a
strange
place
,
before
he
had
become
*NL*
acquainted
with
any
of
its
inhabitants
.
The
winter
,
however
,
was
spent
*NL*
cheerfully
;
and
although
the
spring
was
uncommonly
late
,
when
it
came
*NL*
its
beauty
compensated
for
its
dilatoriness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
month
of
May
had
already
commenced
,
and
I
expected
the
letter
daily
*NL*
which
was
to
fix
the
date
of
my
departure
,
when
Henry
proposed
a
*NL*
pedestrian
tour
in
the
environs
of
Ingolstadt
,
that
I
might
bid
a
*NL*
personal
farewell
to
the
country
I
had
so
long
inhabited
.
I
acceded
*NL*
with
pleasure
to
this
proposition
:
I
was
fond
of
exercise
,
and
Clerval
*NL*
had
always
been
my
favourite
companion
in
the
ramble
of
this
nature
*NL*
that
I
had
taken
among
the
scenes
of
my
native
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
passed
a
fortnight
in
these
perambulations
:
my
health
and
spirits
*NL*
had
long
been
restored
,
and
they
gained
additional
strength
from
the
*NL*
salubrious
air
I
breathed
,
the
natural
incidents
of
our
progress
,
and
*NL*
the
conversation
of
my
friend
.
Study
had
before
secluded
me
from
the
*NL*
intercourse
of
my
fellow-creatures
,
and
rendered
me
unsocial
;
but
*NL*
Clerval
called
forth
the
better
feelings
of
my
heart
;
he
again
taught
*NL*
me
to
love
the
aspect
of
nature
,
and
the
cheerful
faces
of
children
.
*NL*
Excellent
friend
!
how
sincerely
you
did
love
me
,
and
endeavour
to
*NL*
elevate
my
mind
until
it
was
on
a
level
with
your
own
.
A
selfish
*NL*
pursuit
had
cramped
and
narrowed
me
,
until
your
gentleness
and
*NL*
affection
warmed
and
opened
my
senses
;
I
became
the
same
happy
creature
*NL*
who
,
a
few
years
ago
,
loved
and
beloved
by
all
,
had
no
sorrow
or
care
.
*NL*
When
happy
,
inanimate
nature
had
the
power
of
bestowing
on
me
the
most
*NL*
delightful
sensations
.
A
serene
sky
and
verdant
fields
filled
me
with
*NL*
ecstasy
.
The
present
season
was
indeed
divine
;
the
flowers
of
spring
*NL*
bloomed
in
the
hedges
,
while
those
of
summer
were
already
in
bud
.
I
*NL*
was
undisturbed
by
thoughts
which
during
the
preceding
year
had
pressed
*NL*
upon
me
,
notwithstanding
my
endeavours
to
throw
them
off
,
with
an
*NL*
invincible
burden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
rejoiced
in
my
gaiety
,
and
sincerely
sympathised
in
my
feelings
:
*NL*
he
exerted
himself
to
amuse
me
,
while
he
expressed
the
sensations
that
*NL*
filled
his
soul
.
The
resources
of
his
mind
on
this
occasion
were
truly
*NL*
astonishing
:
his
conversation
was
full
of
imagination
;
and
very
often
,
*NL*
in
imitation
of
the
Persian
and
Arabic
writers
,
he
invented
tales
of
*NL*
wonderful
fancy
and
passion
.
At
other
times
he
repeated
my
favourite
*NL*
poems
,
or
drew
me
out
into
arguments
,
which
he
supported
with
great
*NL*
ingenuity
.
We
returned
to
our
college
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
:
the
*NL*
peasants
were
dancing
,
and
every
one
we
met
appeared
gay
and
happy
.
My
*NL*
own
spirits
were
high
,
and
I
bounded
along
with
feelings
of
unbridled
*NL*
joy
and
hilarity
.

On
my
return
,
I
found
the
following
letter
from
my
father
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Victor
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
probably
waited
impatiently
for
a
letter
to
fix
the
date
of
*NL*
your
return
to
us
;
and
I
was
at
first
tempted
to
write
only
a
few
*NL*
lines
,
merely
mentioning
the
day
on
which
I
should
expect
you
.
But
*NL*
that
would
be
a
cruel
kindness
,
and
I
dare
not
do
it
.
What
would
be
*NL*
your
surprise
,
my
son
,
when
you
expected
a
happy
and
glad
welcome
,
to
*NL*
behold
,
on
the
contrary
,
tears
and
wretchedness
?
And
how
,
Victor
,
can
*NL*
I
relate
our
misfortune
?
Absence
can
not
have
rendered
you
callous
to
*NL*
our
joys
and
griefs
;
and
how
shall
I
inflict
pain
on
my
long
absent
*NL*
son
?
I
wish
to
prepare
you
for
the
woeful
news
,
but
I
know
it
is
*NL*
impossible
;
even
now
your
eye
skims
over
the
page
to
seek
the
words
*NL*
which
are
to
convey
to
you
the
horrible
tidings

*NL*
``
William
is
dead

sweet
child

smiles
delighted
and
warmed

gentle

yet
so
gay

is
murdered

*NL*
``
I
will
not
attempt
to

you

``
Last
Thursday
-LRB-
May
7th
-RRB-
,
I
,
my
niece
,
and
your
two
brothers
,
went
to
*NL*
walk
in
Plainpalais
.
The
evening
was
warm
and
serene
,
and
we
prolonged
*NL*
our
walk
farther
than
usual
.
It
was
already
dusk
before
we
thought
of
*NL*
returning
;
and
then
we
discovered
that
William
and
Ernest
,
who
had
gone
*NL*
on
before
,
were
not
to
be
found
.
We
accordingly
rested
on
a
seat
until
*NL*
they
should
return
.
Presently
Ernest
came
,
and
enquired
if
we
had
seen
*NL*
his
brother
;
he
said
,
that
he
had
been
playing
with
him
,
that
William
*NL*
had
run
away
to
hide
himself
,
and
that
he
vainly
sought
for
him
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
waited
for
a
long
time
,
but
that
he
did
not
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
account
rather
alarmed
us
,
and
we
continued
to
search
for
him
*NL*
until
night
fell
,
when
Elizabeth
conjectured
that
he
might
have
*NL*
returned
to
the
house
.
He
was
not
there
.
We
returned
again
,
with
*NL*
torches
;
for
I
could
not
rest
,
when
I
thought
that
my
sweet
boy
had
*NL*
lost
himself
,
and
was
exposed
to
all
the
damps
and
dews
of
night
;
*NL*
Elizabeth
also
suffered
extreme
anguish
.
About
five
in
the
morning
I
*NL*
discovered
my
lovely
boy
,
whom
the
night
before
I
had
seen
blooming
and
*NL*
active
in
health
,
stretched
on
the
grass
livid
and
motionless
;
the
*NL*
print
of
the
murder
's
finger
was
on
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
conveyed
home
,
and
the
anguish
that
was
visible
in
my
*NL*
countenance
betrayed
the
secret
to
Elizabeth
.
She
was
very
earnest
to
*NL*
see
the
corpse
.
At
first
I
attempted
to
prevent
her
but
she
persisted
,
*NL*
and
entering
the
room
where
it
lay
,
hastily
examined
the
neck
of
the
*NL*
victim
,
and
clasping
her
hands
exclaimed
,
'
O
God
!
I
have
murdered
my
*NL*
darling
child
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
fainted
,
and
was
restored
with
extreme
difficulty
.
When
she
again
*NL*
lived
,
it
was
only
to
weep
and
sigh
.
She
told
me
,
that
that
same
*NL*
evening
William
had
teased
her
to
let
him
wear
a
very
valuable
*NL*
miniature
that
she
possessed
of
your
mother
.
This
picture
is
gone
,
and
*NL*
was
doubtless
the
temptation
which
urged
the
murderer
to
the
deed
.
We
*NL*
have
no
trace
of
him
at
present
,
although
our
exertions
to
discover
him
*NL*
are
unremitted
;
but
they
will
not
restore
my
beloved
William
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
dearest
Victor
;
you
alone
can
console
Elizabeth
.
She
weeps
*NL*
continually
,
and
accuses
herself
unjustly
as
the
cause
of
his
death
;
*NL*
her
words
pierce
my
heart
.
We
are
all
unhappy
;
but
will
not
that
be
an
*NL*
additional
motive
for
you
,
my
son
,
to
return
and
be
our
comforter
?

Alas

I
now
say

Thank

did
not
live

cruel

miserable
death

Come

not
brooding
thoughts
of
vengeance
against

heal

festering

the
wounds

our

*NL*
*NL*
Clerval
,
who
had
watched
my
countenance
as
I
read
this
letter
,
was
*NL*
surprised
to
observe
the
despair
that
succeeded
the
joy
I
at
first
*NL*
expressed
on
receiving
new
from
my
friends
.
I
threw
the
letter
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Frankenstein

exclaimed
Henry
,
when
he
perceived
me
weep
with
*NL*
bitterness
,
``

always
to

My

*NL*
*NL*
I
motioned
him
to
take
up
the
letter
,
while
I
walked
up
and
down
the
*NL*
room
in
the
extremest
agitation
.
Tears
also
gushed
from
the
eyes
of
*NL*
Clerval
,
as
he
read
the
account
of
my
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
offer
you
no
consolation
,
my
friend

said
he
;
``
your
disaster
is
*NL*
irreparable

What
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

*NL*
*NL*
During
our
walk
,
Clerval
endeavoured
to
say
a
few
words
of
consolation
;
*NL*
he
could
only
express
his
heartfelt
sympathy
.
``
Poor
William
!
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
dear
lovely
child

he
now
sleeps

Who
that

*NL*
seen

bright

joyous
in
his

must
weep
over
his

untimely
loss

To
die
so
miserably

feel

How

Poor

one

consolation

at
an
end

*NL*
A
sod
covers
his
gentle
form

and
he
knows
no
pain

He
can
no
longer
*NL*
be
a
subject
for
pity
;
we
must
reserve
that
for
his

''
*NL*
*NL*
Clerval
spoke
thus
as
we
hurried
through
the
streets
;
the
words
*NL*
impressed
themselves
on
my
mind
and
I
remembered
them
afterwards
in
*NL*
solitude
.
But
now
,
as
soon
as
the
horses
arrived
,
I
hurried
into
a
*NL*
cabriolet
,
and
bade
farewell
to
my
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
journey
was
very
melancholy
.
At
first
I
wished
to
hurry
on
,
for
I
*NL*
longed
to
console
and
sympathise
with
my
loved
and
sorrowing
friends
;
*NL*
but
when
I
drew
near
my
native
town
,
I
slackened
my
progress
.
I
could
*NL*
hardly
sustain
the
multitude
of
feelings
that
crowded
into
my
mind
.
I
*NL*
passed
through
scenes
familiar
to
my
youth
,
but
which
I
had
not
seen
*NL*
for
nearly
six
years
.
How
altered
every
thing
might
be
during
that
*NL*
time
!
One
sudden
and
desolating
change
had
taken
place
;
but
a
thousand
*NL*
little
circumstances
might
have
by
degrees
worked
other
alterations
,
*NL*
which
,
although
they
were
done
more
tranquilly
,
might
not
be
the
less
*NL*
decisive
.
Fear
overcame
me
;
I
dared
no
advance
,
dreading
a
thousand
*NL*
nameless
evils
that
made
me
tremble
,
although
I
was
unable
to
define
*NL*
them
.
I
remained
two
days
at
Lausanne
,
in
this
painful
state
of
mind
.
*NL*
I
contemplated
the
lake
:
the
waters
were
placid
;
all
around
was
calm
;
*NL*
and
the
snowy
mountains
,
`
the
palaces
of
nature
,
'
were
not
changed
.
By
*NL*
degrees
the
calm
and
heavenly
scene
restored
me
,
and
I
continued
my
*NL*
journey
towards
Geneva
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
road
ran
by
the
side
of
the
lake
,
which
became
narrower
as
I
*NL*
approached
my
native
town
.
I
discovered
more
distinctly
the
black
*NL*
sides
of
Jura
,
and
the
bright
summit
of
Mont
Blanc
.
I
wept
like
a
*NL*
child
.
``
Dear
mountains
!
my
own
beautiful
lake
!
how
do
you
welcome
your
*NL*
wanderer
?
Your
summits
are
clear
;
the
sky
and
lake
are
blue
and
*NL*
placid
.
Is
this
to
prognosticate
peace
,
or
to
mock
at
my
unhappiness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
fear
,
my
friend
,
that
I
shall
render
myself
tedious
by
dwelling
on
*NL*
these
preliminary
circumstances
;
but
they
were
days
of
comparative
*NL*
happiness
,
and
I
think
of
them
with
pleasure
.
My
country
,
my
beloved
*NL*
country
!
who
but
a
native
can
tell
the
delight
I
took
in
again
*NL*
beholding
thy
streams
,
thy
mountains
,
and
,
more
than
all
,
thy
lovely
*NL*
lake
!
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
as
I
drew
nearer
home
,
grief
and
fear
again
overcame
me
.
Night
*NL*
also
closed
around
;
and
when
I
could
hardly
see
the
dark
mountains
,
I
*NL*
felt
still
more
gloomily
.
The
picture
appeared
a
vast
and
dim
scene
of
*NL*
evil
,
and
I
foresaw
obscurely
that
I
was
destined
to
become
the
most
*NL*
wretched
of
human
beings
.
Alas
!
I
prophesied
truly
,
and
failed
only
*NL*
in
one
single
circumstance
,
that
in
all
the
misery
I
imagined
and
*NL*
dreaded
,
I
did
not
conceive
the
hundredth
part
of
the
anguish
I
was
*NL*
destined
to
endure
.
It
was
completely
dark
when
I
arrived
in
the
*NL*
environs
of
Geneva
;
the
gates
of
the
town
were
already
shut
;
and
I
was
*NL*
obliged
to
pass
the
night
at
Secheron
,
a
village
at
the
distance
of
*NL*
half
a
league
from
the
city
.
The
sky
was
serene
;
and
,
as
I
was
unable
*NL*
to
rest
,
I
resolved
to
visit
the
spot
where
my
poor
William
had
been
*NL*
murdered
.
As
I
could
not
pass
through
the
town
,
I
was
obliged
to
cross
*NL*
the
lake
in
a
boat
to
arrive
at
Plainpalais
.
During
this
short
voyage
*NL*
I
saw
the
lightning
playing
on
the
summit
of
Mont
Blanc
in
the
most
*NL*
beautiful
figures
.
The
storm
appeared
to
approach
rapidly
,
and
,
on
*NL*
landing
,
I
ascended
a
low
hill
,
that
I
might
observe
its
progress
.
It
*NL*
advanced
;
the
heavens
were
clouded
,
and
I
soon
felt
the
rain
coming
*NL*
slowly
in
large
drops
,
but
its
violence
quickly
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
quitted
my
seat
,
and
walked
on
,
although
the
darkness
and
storm
*NL*
increased
every
minute
,
and
the
thunder
burst
with
a
terrific
crash
*NL*
over
my
head
.
It
was
echoed
from
Saleve
,
the
Juras
,
and
the
Alps
of
*NL*
Savoy
;
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
dazzled
my
eyes
,
illuminating
the
*NL*
lake
,
making
it
appear
like
a
vast
sheet
of
fire
;
then
for
an
instant
*NL*
every
thing
seemed
of
a
pitchy
darkness
,
until
the
eye
recovered
itself
*NL*
from
the
preceding
flash
.
The
storm
,
as
is
often
the
case
in
*NL*
Switzerland
,
appeared
at
once
in
various
parts
of
the
heavens
.
The
*NL*
most
violent
storm
hung
exactly
north
of
the
town
,
over
the
part
of
the
*NL*
lake
which
lies
between
the
promontory
of
Belrive
and
the
village
of
*NL*
Copet
.
Another
storm
enlightened
Jura
with
faint
flashes
;
and
another
*NL*
darkened
and
sometimes
disclosed
the
Mole
,
a
peaked
mountain
to
the
*NL*
east
of
the
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
watched
the
tempest
,
so
beautiful
yet
terrific
,
I
wandered
on
*NL*
with
a
hasty
step
.
This
noble
war
in
the
sky
elevated
my
spirits
;
I
*NL*
clasped
my
hands
,
and
exclaimed
aloud
,
``
William
,
dear
angel
!
this
is
*NL*
thy
funeral
,
this
thy
dirge
!
''
As
I
said
these
words
,
I
perceived
in
the
*NL*
gloom
a
figure
which
stole
from
behind
a
clump
of
trees
near
me
;
I
*NL*
stood
fixed
,
gazing
intently
:
I
could
not
be
mistaken
.
A
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
illuminated
the
object
,
and
discovered
its
shape
plainly
to
*NL*
me
;
its
gigantic
stature
,
and
the
deformity
of
its
aspect
more
hideous
*NL*
than
belongs
to
humanity
,
instantly
informed
me
that
it
was
the
wretch
,
*NL*
the
filthy
daemon
,
to
whom
I
had
given
life
.
What
did
he
there
?
Could
*NL*
he
be
-LRB-
I
shuddered
at
the
conception
-RRB-
the
murderer
of
my
brother
?
No
*NL*
sooner
did
that
idea
cross
my
imagination
,
than
I
became
convinced
of
*NL*
its
truth
;
my
teeth
chattered
,
and
I
was
forced
to
lean
against
a
tree
*NL*
for
support
.
The
figure
passed
me
quickly
,
and
I
lost
it
in
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
in
human
shape
could
have
destroyed
the
fair
child
.
HE
was
the
*NL*
murderer
!
I
could
not
doubt
it
.
The
mere
presence
of
the
idea
was
an
*NL*
irresistible
proof
of
the
fact
.
I
thought
of
pursuing
the
devil
;
but
*NL*
it
would
have
been
in
vain
,
for
another
flash
discovered
him
to
me
*NL*
hanging
among
the
rocks
of
the
nearly
perpendicular
ascent
of
Mont
*NL*
Saleve
,
a
hill
that
bounds
Plainpalais
on
the
south
.
He
soon
reached
*NL*
the
summit
,
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remained
motionless
.
The
thunder
ceased
;
but
the
rain
still
*NL*
continued
,
and
the
scene
was
enveloped
in
an
impenetrable
darkness
.
I
*NL*
revolved
in
my
mind
the
events
which
I
had
until
now
sought
to
forget
:
*NL*
the
whole
train
of
my
progress
toward
the
creation
;
the
appearance
of
*NL*
the
works
of
my
own
hands
at
my
bedside
;
its
departure
.
Two
years
had
*NL*
now
nearly
elapsed
since
the
night
on
which
he
first
received
life
;
and
*NL*
was
this
his
first
crime
?
Alas
!
I
had
turned
loose
into
the
world
a
*NL*
depraved
wretch
,
whose
delight
was
in
carnage
and
misery
;
had
he
not
*NL*
murdered
my
brother
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
can
conceive
the
anguish
I
suffered
during
the
remainder
of
the
*NL*
night
,
which
I
spent
,
cold
and
wet
,
in
the
open
air
.
But
I
did
not
*NL*
feel
the
inconvenience
of
the
weather
;
my
imagination
was
busy
in
*NL*
scenes
of
evil
and
despair
.
I
considered
the
being
whom
I
had
cast
*NL*
among
mankind
,
and
endowed
with
the
will
and
power
to
effect
purposes
*NL*
of
horror
,
such
as
the
deed
which
he
had
now
done
,
nearly
in
the
light
*NL*
of
my
own
vampire
,
my
own
spirit
let
loose
from
the
grave
,
and
forced
*NL*
to
destroy
all
that
was
dear
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
dawned
;
and
I
directed
my
steps
towards
the
town
.
The
gates
were
*NL*
open
,
and
I
hastened
to
my
father
's
house
.
My
first
thought
was
to
*NL*
discover
what
I
knew
of
the
murderer
,
and
cause
instant
pursuit
to
be
*NL*
made
.
But
I
paused
when
I
reflected
on
the
story
that
I
had
to
tell
.
A
*NL*
being
whom
I
myself
had
formed
,
and
endued
with
life
,
had
met
me
at
*NL*
midnight
among
the
precipices
of
an
inaccessible
mountain
.
I
*NL*
remembered
also
the
nervous
fever
with
which
I
had
been
seized
just
at
*NL*
the
time
that
I
dated
my
creation
,
and
which
would
give
an
air
of
*NL*
delirium
to
a
tale
otherwise
so
utterly
improbable
.
I
well
knew
that
*NL*
if
any
other
had
communicated
such
a
relation
to
me
,
I
should
have
*NL*
looked
upon
it
as
the
ravings
of
insanity
.
Besides
,
the
strange
nature
*NL*
of
the
animal
would
elude
all
pursuit
,
even
if
I
were
so
far
credited
*NL*
as
to
persuade
my
relatives
to
commence
it
.
And
then
of
what
use
would
*NL*
be
pursuit
?
Who
could
arrest
a
creature
capable
of
scaling
the
*NL*
overhanging
sides
of
Mont
Saleve
?
These
reflections
determined
me
,
and
*NL*
I
resolved
to
remain
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
five
in
the
morning
when
I
entered
my
father
's
house
.
I
*NL*
told
the
servants
not
to
disturb
the
family
,
and
went
into
the
library
*NL*
to
attend
their
usual
hour
of
rising
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
years
had
elapsed
,
passed
in
a
dream
but
for
one
indelible
trace
,
*NL*
and
I
stood
in
the
same
place
where
I
had
last
embraced
my
father
*NL*
before
my
departure
for
Ingolstadt
.
Beloved
and
venerable
parent
!
He
*NL*
still
remained
to
me
.
I
gazed
on
the
picture
of
my
mother
,
which
stood
*NL*
over
the
mantel-piece
.
It
was
an
historical
subject
,
painted
at
my
*NL*
father
's
desire
,
and
represented
Caroline
Beaufort
in
an
agony
of
*NL*
despair
,
kneeling
by
the
coffin
of
her
dead
father
.
Her
garb
was
*NL*
rustic
,
and
her
cheek
pale
;
but
there
was
an
air
of
dignity
and
beauty
,
*NL*
that
hardly
permitted
the
sentiment
of
pity
.
Below
this
picture
was
a
*NL*
miniature
of
William
;
and
my
tears
flowed
when
I
looked
upon
it
.
While
*NL*
I
was
thus
engaged
,
Ernest
entered
:
he
had
heard
me
arrive
,
and
*NL*
hastened
to
welcome
me
:
``
Welcome
,
my
dearest
Victor
,
''
said
he
.
``
Ah
!
I
*NL*
wish
you
had
come
three
months
ago
,
and
then
you
would
have
found
us
*NL*
all
joyous
and
delighted
.
You
come
to
us
now
to
share
a
misery
which
*NL*
nothing
can
alleviate
;
yet
your
presence
will
,
I
hope
,
revive
our
*NL*
father
,
who
seems
sinking
under
his
misfortune
;
and
your
persuasions
*NL*
will
induce
poor
Elizabeth
to
cease
her
vain
and
tormenting
*NL*
self-accusations
.
--
Poor
William
!
he
was
our
darling
and
our
pride
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
,
unrestrained
,
fell
from
my
brother
's
eyes
;
a
sense
of
mortal
*NL*
agony
crept
over
my
frame
.
Before
,
I
had
only
imagined
the
*NL*
wretchedness
of
my
desolated
home
;
the
reality
came
on
me
as
a
new
,
and
*NL*
a
not
less
terrible
,
disaster
.
I
tried
to
calm
Ernest
;
I
enquired
more
*NL*
minutely
concerning
my
father
,
and
here
I
named
my
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
most
of
all
,
''
said
Ernest
,
``
requires
consolation
;
she
accused
*NL*
herself
of
having
caused
the
death
of
my
brother
,
and
that
made
her
*NL*
very
wretched
.
But
since
the
murderer
has
been
discovered
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
murderer
discovered
!
Good
God
!
how
can
that
be
?
who
could
attempt
*NL*
to
pursue
him
?
It
is
impossible
;
one
might
as
well
try
to
overtake
the
*NL*
winds
,
or
confine
a
mountain-stream
with
a
straw
.
I
saw
him
too
;
he
*NL*
was
free
last
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
,
''
replied
my
brother
,
in
accents
of
*NL*
wonder
,
``
but
to
us
the
discovery
we
have
made
completes
our
misery
.
No
*NL*
one
would
believe
it
at
first
;
and
even
now
Elizabeth
will
not
be
*NL*
convinced
,
notwithstanding
all
the
evidence
.
Indeed
,
who
would
credit
*NL*
that
Justine
Moritz
,
who
was
so
amiable
,
and
fond
of
all
the
family
,
*NL*
could
suddenly
become
so
capable
of
so
frightful
,
so
appalling
a
crime
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Justine
Moritz
!
Poor
,
poor
girl
,
is
she
the
accused
?
But
it
is
*NL*
wrongfully
;
every
one
knows
that
;
no
one
believes
it
,
surely
,
Ernest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
did
at
first
;
but
several
circumstances
came
out
,
that
have
*NL*
almost
forced
conviction
upon
us
;
and
her
own
behaviour
has
been
so
*NL*
confused
,
as
to
add
to
the
evidence
of
facts
a
weight
that
,
I
fear
,
*NL*
leaves
no
hope
for
doubt
.
But
she
will
be
tried
today
,
and
you
will
*NL*
then
hear
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
related
that
,
the
morning
on
which
the
murder
of
poor
William
*NL*
had
been
discovered
,
Justine
had
been
taken
ill
,
and
confined
to
her
*NL*
bed
for
several
days
.
During
this
interval
,
one
of
the
servants
,
*NL*
happening
to
examine
the
apparel
she
had
worn
on
the
night
of
the
*NL*
murder
,
had
discovered
in
her
pocket
the
picture
of
my
mother
,
which
*NL*
had
been
judged
to
be
the
temptation
of
the
murderer
.
The
servant
*NL*
instantly
showed
it
to
one
of
the
others
,
who
,
without
saying
a
word
to
*NL*
any
of
the
family
,
went
to
a
magistrate
;
and
,
upon
their
deposition
,
*NL*
Justine
was
apprehended
.
On
being
charged
with
the
fact
,
the
poor
girl
*NL*
confirmed
the
suspicion
in
a
great
measure
by
her
extreme
confusion
of
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
strange
tale
,
but
it
did
not
shake
my
faith
;
and
I
replied
*NL*
earnestly
,
``
You
are
all
mistaken
;
I
know
the
murderer
.
Justine
,
poor
,
*NL*
good
Justine
,
is
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
my
father
entered
.
I
saw
unhappiness
deeply
impressed
*NL*
on
his
countenance
,
but
he
endeavoured
to
welcome
me
cheerfully
;
and
,
*NL*
after
we
had
exchanged
our
mournful
greeting
,
would
have
introduced
*NL*
some
other
topic
than
that
of
our
disaster
,
had
not
Ernest
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
papa
!
Victor
says
that
he
knows
who
was
the
murderer
of
*NL*
poor
William
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
also
,
unfortunately
,
''
replied
my
father
,
``
for
indeed
I
had
*NL*
rather
have
been
for
ever
ignorant
than
have
discovered
so
much
*NL*
depravity
and
ungratitude
in
one
I
valued
so
highly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
father
,
you
are
mistaken
;
Justine
is
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
is
,
God
forbid
that
she
should
suffer
as
guilty
.
She
is
to
be
*NL*
tried
today
,
and
I
hope
,
I
sincerely
hope
,
that
she
will
be
acquitted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
calmed
me
.
I
was
firmly
convinced
in
my
own
mind
that
*NL*
Justine
,
and
indeed
every
human
being
,
was
guiltless
of
this
murder
.
I
*NL*
had
no
fear
,
therefore
,
that
any
circumstantial
evidence
could
be
*NL*
brought
forward
strong
enough
to
convict
her
.
My
tale
was
not
one
to
*NL*
announce
publicly
;
its
astounding
horror
would
be
looked
upon
as
*NL*
madness
by
the
vulgar
.
Did
any
one
indeed
exist
,
except
I
,
the
*NL*
creator
,
who
would
believe
,
unless
his
senses
convinced
him
,
in
the
*NL*
existence
of
the
living
monument
of
presumption
and
rash
ignorance
*NL*
which
I
had
let
loose
upon
the
world
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
soon
joined
by
Elizabeth
.
Time
had
altered
her
since
I
last
*NL*
beheld
her
;
it
had
endowed
her
with
loveliness
surpassing
the
beauty
of
*NL*
her
childish
years
.
There
was
the
same
candour
,
the
same
vivacity
,
but
*NL*
it
was
allied
to
an
expression
more
full
of
sensibility
and
intellect
.
*NL*
She
welcomed
me
with
the
greatest
affection
.
``
Your
arrival
,
my
dear
*NL*
cousin
,
''
said
she
,
``
fills
me
with
hope
.
You
perhaps
will
find
some
*NL*
means
to
justify
my
poor
guiltless
Justine
.
Alas
!
who
is
safe
,
if
she
*NL*
be
convicted
of
crime
?
I
rely
on
her
innocence
as
certainly
as
I
do
*NL*
upon
my
own
.
Our
misfortune
is
doubly
hard
to
us
;
we
have
not
only
*NL*
lost
that
lovely
darling
boy
,
but
this
poor
girl
,
whom
I
sincerely
*NL*
love
,
is
to
be
torn
away
by
even
a
worse
fate
.
If
she
is
condemned
,
I
*NL*
never
shall
know
joy
more
.
But
she
will
not
,
I
am
sure
she
will
not
;
*NL*
and
then
I
shall
be
happy
again
,
even
after
the
sad
death
of
my
little
*NL*
William
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
innocent
,
my
Elizabeth
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
that
shall
be
proved
;
*NL*
fear
nothing
,
but
let
your
spirits
be
cheered
by
the
assurance
of
her
*NL*
acquittal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
and
generous
you
are
!
every
one
else
believes
in
her
guilt
,
*NL*
and
that
made
me
wretched
,
for
I
knew
that
it
was
impossible
:
and
to
*NL*
see
every
one
else
prejudiced
in
so
deadly
a
manner
rendered
me
*NL*
hopeless
and
despairing
.
''
She
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
niece
,
''
said
my
father
,
``
dry
your
tears
.
If
she
is
,
as
you
*NL*
believe
,
innocent
,
rely
on
the
justice
of
our
laws
,
and
the
activity
*NL*
with
which
I
shall
prevent
the
slightest
shadow
of
partiality
.

Chapter
8
*NL*
*NL*
We
passed
a
few
sad
hours
until
eleven
o'clock
,
when
the
trial
was
to
*NL*
commence
.
My
father
and
the
rest
of
the
family
being
obliged
to
attend
*NL*
as
witnesses
,
I
accompanied
them
to
the
court
.
During
the
whole
of
*NL*
this
wretched
mockery
of
justice
I
suffered
living
torture
.
It
was
to
*NL*
be
decided
whether
the
result
of
my
curiosity
and
lawless
devices
would
*NL*
cause
the
death
of
two
of
my
fellow
beings
:
one
a
smiling
babe
full
of
*NL*
innocence
and
joy
,
the
other
far
more
dreadfully
murdered
,
with
every
*NL*
aggravation
of
infamy
that
could
make
the
murder
memorable
in
horror
.
*NL*
Justine
also
was
a
girl
of
merit
and
possessed
qualities
which
promised
*NL*
to
render
her
life
happy
;
now
all
was
to
be
obliterated
in
an
*NL*
ignominious
grave
,
and
I
the
cause
!
A
thousand
times
rather
would
I
*NL*
have
confessed
myself
guilty
of
the
crime
ascribed
to
Justine
,
but
I
*NL*
was
absent
when
it
was
committed
,
and
such
a
declaration
would
have
*NL*
been
considered
as
the
ravings
of
a
madman
and
would
not
have
*NL*
exculpated
her
who
suffered
through
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appearance
of
Justine
was
calm
.
She
was
dressed
in
mourning
,
and
*NL*
her
countenance
,
always
engaging
,
was
rendered
,
by
the
solemnity
of
her
*NL*
feelings
,
exquisitely
beautiful
.
Yet
she
appeared
confident
in
*NL*
innocence
and
did
not
tremble
,
although
gazed
on
and
execrated
by
*NL*
thousands
,
for
all
the
kindness
which
her
beauty
might
otherwise
have
*NL*
excited
was
obliterated
in
the
minds
of
the
spectators
by
the
*NL*
imagination
of
the
enormity
she
was
supposed
to
have
committed
.
She
*NL*
was
tranquil
,
yet
her
tranquillity
was
evidently
constrained
;
and
as
*NL*
her
confusion
had
before
been
adduced
as
a
proof
of
her
guilt
,
she
*NL*
worked
up
her
mind
to
an
appearance
of
courage
.
When
she
entered
the
*NL*
court
she
threw
her
eyes
round
it
and
quickly
discovered
where
we
were
*NL*
seated
.
A
tear
seemed
to
dim
her
eye
when
she
saw
us
,
but
she
quickly
*NL*
recovered
herself
,
and
a
look
of
sorrowful
affection
seemed
to
attest
*NL*
her
utter
guiltlessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trial
began
,
and
after
the
advocate
against
her
had
stated
the
*NL*
charge
,
several
witnesses
were
called
.
Several
strange
facts
combined
*NL*
against
her
,
which
might
have
staggered
anyone
who
had
not
such
proof
*NL*
of
her
innocence
as
I
had
.
She
had
been
out
the
whole
of
the
night
on
*NL*
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
and
towards
morning
had
been
*NL*
perceived
by
a
market-woman
not
far
from
the
spot
where
the
body
of
the
*NL*
murdered
child
had
been
afterwards
found
.
The
woman
asked
her
what
she
*NL*
did
there
,
but
she
looked
very
strangely
and
only
returned
a
confused
*NL*
and
unintelligible
answer
.
She
returned
to
the
house
about
eight
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
when
one
inquired
where
she
had
passed
the
night
,
she
*NL*
replied
that
she
had
been
looking
for
the
child
and
demanded
earnestly
*NL*
if
anything
had
been
heard
concerning
him
.
When
shown
the
body
,
she
*NL*
fell
into
violent
hysterics
and
kept
her
bed
for
several
days
.
The
*NL*
picture
was
then
produced
which
the
servant
had
found
in
her
pocket
;
*NL*
and
when
Elizabeth
,
in
a
faltering
voice
,
proved
that
it
was
the
same
*NL*
which
,
an
hour
before
the
child
had
been
missed
,
she
had
placed
round
*NL*
his
neck
,
a
murmur
of
horror
and
indignation
filled
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
Justine
was
called
on
for
her
defence
.
As
the
trial
had
proceeded
,
her
*NL*
countenance
had
altered
.
Surprise
,
horror
,
and
misery
were
strongly
*NL*
expressed
.
Sometimes
she
struggled
with
her
tears
,
but
when
she
was
*NL*
desired
to
plead
,
she
collected
her
powers
and
spoke
in
an
audible
*NL*
although
variable
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
,
''
she
said
,
``
how
entirely
I
am
innocent
.
But
I
do
not
*NL*
pretend
that
my
protestations
should
acquit
me
;
I
rest
my
innocence
on
*NL*
a
plain
and
simple
explanation
of
the
facts
which
have
been
adduced
*NL*
against
me
,
and
I
hope
the
character
I
have
always
borne
will
incline
*NL*
my
judges
to
a
favourable
interpretation
where
any
circumstance
appears
*NL*
doubtful
or
suspicious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
related
that
,
by
the
permission
of
Elizabeth
,
she
had
passed
*NL*
the
evening
of
the
night
on
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
at
the
*NL*
house
of
an
aunt
at
Chene
,
a
village
situated
at
about
a
league
from
*NL*
Geneva
.
On
her
return
,
at
about
nine
o'clock
,
she
met
a
man
who
asked
*NL*
her
if
she
had
seen
anything
of
the
child
who
was
lost
.
She
was
*NL*
alarmed
by
this
account
and
passed
several
hours
in
looking
for
him
,
*NL*
when
the
gates
of
Geneva
were
shut
,
and
she
was
forced
to
remain
*NL*
several
hours
of
the
night
in
a
barn
belonging
to
a
cottage
,
being
*NL*
unwilling
to
call
up
the
inhabitants
,
to
whom
she
was
well
known
.
Most
*NL*
of
the
night
she
spent
here
watching
;
towards
morning
she
believed
that
*NL*
she
slept
for
a
few
minutes
;
some
steps
disturbed
her
,
and
she
awoke
.
*NL*
It
was
dawn
,
and
she
quitted
her
asylum
,
that
she
might
again
endeavour
*NL*
to
find
my
brother
.
If
she
had
gone
near
the
spot
where
his
body
lay
,
*NL*
it
was
without
her
knowledge
.
That
she
had
been
bewildered
when
*NL*
questioned
by
the
market-woman
was
not
surprising
,
since
she
had
passed
*NL*
a
sleepless
night
and
the
fate
of
poor
William
was
yet
uncertain
.
*NL*
Concerning
the
picture
she
could
give
no
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
continued
the
unhappy
victim
,
``
how
heavily
and
fatally
this
*NL*
one
circumstance
weighs
against
me
,
but
I
have
no
power
of
explaining
*NL*
it
;
and
when
I
have
expressed
my
utter
ignorance
,
I
am
only
left
to
*NL*
conjecture
concerning
the
probabilities
by
which
it
might
have
been
*NL*
placed
in
my
pocket
.
But
here
also
I
am
checked
.
I
believe
that
I
*NL*
have
no
enemy
on
earth
,
and
none
surely
would
have
been
so
wicked
as
to
*NL*
destroy
me
wantonly
.
Did
the
murderer
place
it
there
?
I
know
of
no
*NL*
opportunity
afforded
him
for
so
doing
;
or
,
if
I
had
,
why
should
he
have
*NL*
stolen
the
jewel
,
to
part
with
it
again
so
soon
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
commit
my
cause
to
the
justice
of
my
judges
,
yet
I
see
no
room
for
*NL*
hope
.
I
beg
permission
to
have
a
few
witnesses
examined
concerning
my
*NL*
character
,
and
if
their
testimony
shall
not
overweigh
my
supposed
*NL*
guilt
,
I
must
be
condemned
,
although
I
would
pledge
my
salvation
on
my
*NL*
innocence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
witnesses
were
called
who
had
known
her
for
many
years
,
and
*NL*
they
spoke
well
of
her
;
but
fear
and
hatred
of
the
crime
of
which
they
*NL*
supposed
her
guilty
rendered
them
timorous
and
unwilling
to
come
*NL*
forward
.
Elizabeth
saw
even
this
last
resource
,
her
excellent
*NL*
dispositions
and
irreproachable
conduct
,
about
to
fail
the
accused
,
*NL*
when
,
although
violently
agitated
,
she
desired
permission
to
address
*NL*
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
said
she
,
``
the
cousin
of
the
unhappy
child
who
was
murdered
,
or
*NL*
rather
his
sister
,
for
I
was
educated
by
and
have
lived
with
his
*NL*
parents
ever
since
and
even
long
before
his
birth
.
It
may
therefore
be
*NL*
judged
indecent
in
me
to
come
forward
on
this
occasion
,
but
when
I
see
*NL*
a
fellow
creature
about
to
perish
through
the
cowardice
of
her
*NL*
pretended
friends
,
I
wish
to
be
allowed
to
speak
,
that
I
may
say
what
I
*NL*
know
of
her
character
.
I
am
well
acquainted
with
the
accused
.
I
have
*NL*
lived
in
the
same
house
with
her
,
at
one
time
for
five
and
at
another
*NL*
for
nearly
two
years
.
During
all
that
period
she
appeared
to
me
the
*NL*
most
amiable
and
benevolent
of
human
creatures
.
She
nursed
Madame
*NL*
Frankenstein
,
my
aunt
,
in
her
last
illness
,
with
the
greatest
affection
*NL*
and
care
and
afterwards
attended
her
own
mother
during
a
tedious
*NL*
illness
,
in
a
manner
that
excited
the
admiration
of
all
who
knew
her
,
*NL*
after
which
she
again
lived
in
my
uncle
's
house
,
where
she
was
beloved
*NL*
by
all
the
family
.
She
was
warmly
attached
to
the
child
who
is
now
*NL*
dead
and
acted
towards
him
like
a
most
affectionate
mother
.
For
my
own
*NL*
part
,
I
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
,
notwithstanding
all
the
evidence
*NL*
produced
against
her
,
I
believe
and
rely
on
her
perfect
innocence
.
She
*NL*
had
no
temptation
for
such
an
action
;
as
to
the
bauble
on
which
the
*NL*
chief
proof
rests
,
if
she
had
earnestly
desired
it
,
I
should
have
*NL*
willingly
given
it
to
her
,
so
much
do
I
esteem
and
value
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
murmur
of
approbation
followed
Elizabeth
's
simple
and
powerful
*NL*
appeal
,
but
it
was
excited
by
her
generous
interference
,
and
not
in
*NL*
favour
of
poor
Justine
,
on
whom
the
public
indignation
was
turned
with
*NL*
renewed
violence
,
charging
her
with
the
blackest
ingratitude
.
She
*NL*
herself
wept
as
Elizabeth
spoke
,
but
she
did
not
answer
.
My
own
*NL*
agitation
and
anguish
was
extreme
during
the
whole
trial
.
I
believed
*NL*
in
her
innocence
;
I
knew
it
.
Could
the
demon
who
had
-LRB-
I
did
not
for
a
*NL*
minute
doubt
-RRB-
murdered
my
brother
also
in
his
hellish
sport
have
*NL*
betrayed
the
innocent
to
death
and
ignominy
?
I
could
not
sustain
the
*NL*
horror
of
my
situation
,
and
when
I
perceived
that
the
popular
voice
and
*NL*
the
countenances
of
the
judges
had
already
condemned
my
unhappy
victim
,
*NL*
I
rushed
out
of
the
court
in
agony
.
The
tortures
of
the
accused
did
*NL*
not
equal
mine
;
she
was
sustained
by
innocence
,
but
the
fangs
of
*NL*
remorse
tore
my
bosom
and
would
not
forgo
their
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
a
night
of
unmingled
wretchedness
.
In
the
morning
I
went
to
*NL*
the
court
;
my
lips
and
throat
were
parched
.
I
dared
not
ask
the
fatal
*NL*
question
,
but
I
was
known
,
and
the
officer
guessed
the
cause
of
my
*NL*
visit
.
The
ballots
had
been
thrown
;
they
were
all
black
,
and
Justine
*NL*
was
condemned
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
pretend
to
describe
what
I
then
felt
.
I
had
before
*NL*
experienced
sensations
of
horror
,
and
I
have
endeavoured
to
bestow
upon
*NL*
them
adequate
expressions
,
but
words
can
not
convey
an
idea
of
the
*NL*
heart-sickening
despair
that
I
then
endured
.
The
person
to
whom
I
*NL*
addressed
myself
added
that
Justine
had
already
confessed
her
guilt
.
*NL*
``
That
evidence
,
''
he
observed
,
``
was
hardly
required
in
so
glaring
a
*NL*
case
,
but
I
am
glad
of
it
,
and
,
indeed
,
none
of
our
judges
like
to
*NL*
condemn
a
criminal
upon
circumstantial
evidence
,
be
it
ever
so
*NL*
decisive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
strange
and
unexpected
intelligence
;
what
could
it
mean
?
Had
*NL*
my
eyes
deceived
me
?
And
was
I
really
as
mad
as
the
whole
world
would
*NL*
believe
me
to
be
if
I
disclosed
the
object
of
my
suspicions
?
I
*NL*
hastened
to
return
home
,
and
Elizabeth
eagerly
demanded
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cousin
,
''
replied
I
,
``
it
is
decided
as
you
may
have
expected
;
all
*NL*
judges
had
rather
that
ten
innocent
should
suffer
than
that
one
guilty
*NL*
should
escape
.
But
she
has
confessed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
dire
blow
to
poor
Elizabeth
,
who
had
relied
with
firmness
*NL*
upon
Justine
's
innocence
.
``
Alas
!
''
said
she
.
``
How
shall
I
ever
again
*NL*
believe
in
human
goodness
?
Justine
,
whom
I
loved
and
esteemed
as
my
*NL*
sister
,
how
could
she
put
on
those
smiles
of
innocence
only
to
betray
?
*NL*
Her
mild
eyes
seemed
incapable
of
any
severity
or
guile
,
and
yet
she
*NL*
has
committed
a
murder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
we
heard
that
the
poor
victim
had
expressed
a
desire
to
see
*NL*
my
cousin
.
My
father
wished
her
not
to
go
but
said
that
he
left
it
to
*NL*
her
own
judgment
and
feelings
to
decide
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
I
*NL*
will
go
,
although
she
is
guilty
;
and
you
,
Victor
,
shall
accompany
me
;
I
*NL*
can
not
go
alone
.
''
The
idea
of
this
visit
was
torture
to
me
,
yet
I
*NL*
could
not
refuse
.
We
entered
the
gloomy
prison
chamber
and
beheld
*NL*
Justine
sitting
on
some
straw
at
the
farther
end
;
her
hands
were
*NL*
manacled
,
and
her
head
rested
on
her
knees
.
She
rose
on
seeing
us
*NL*
enter
,
and
when
we
were
left
alone
with
her
,
she
threw
herself
at
the
*NL*
feet
of
Elizabeth
,
weeping
bitterly
.
My
cousin
wept
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Justine
!
''
said
she
.
``
Why
did
you
rob
me
of
my
last
consolation
?
*NL*
I
relied
on
your
innocence
,
and
although
I
was
then
very
wretched
,
I
*NL*
was
not
so
miserable
as
I
am
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
also
believe
that
I
am
so
very
,
very
wicked
?
Do
you
also
*NL*
join
with
my
enemies
to
crush
me
,
to
condemn
me
as
a
murderer
?
''
Her
*NL*
voice
was
suffocated
with
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rise
,
my
poor
girl
,
''
said
Elizabeth
;
``
why
do
you
kneel
,
if
you
are
*NL*
innocent
?
I
am
not
one
of
your
enemies
,
I
believed
you
guiltless
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
every
evidence
,
until
I
heard
that
you
had
yourself
*NL*
declared
your
guilt
.
That
report
,
you
say
,
is
false
;
and
be
assured
,
*NL*
dear
Justine
,
that
nothing
can
shake
my
confidence
in
you
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
but
your
own
confession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
confess
,
but
I
confessed
a
lie
.
I
confessed
,
that
I
might
*NL*
obtain
absolution
;
but
now
that
falsehood
lies
heavier
at
my
heart
than
*NL*
all
my
other
sins
.
The
God
of
heaven
forgive
me
!
Ever
since
I
was
*NL*
condemned
,
my
confessor
has
besieged
me
;
he
threatened
and
menaced
,
*NL*
until
I
almost
began
to
think
that
I
was
the
monster
that
he
said
I
*NL*
was
.
He
threatened
excommunication
and
hell
fire
in
my
last
moments
if
*NL*
I
continued
obdurate
.
Dear
lady
,
I
had
none
to
support
me
;
all
looked
*NL*
on
me
as
a
wretch
doomed
to
ignominy
and
perdition
.
What
could
I
do
?
*NL*
In
an
evil
hour
I
subscribed
to
a
lie
;
and
now
only
am
I
truly
*NL*
miserable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
weeping
,
and
then
continued
,
``
I
thought
with
horror
,
my
*NL*
sweet
lady
,
that
you
should
believe
your
Justine
,
whom
your
blessed
*NL*
aunt
had
so
highly
honoured
,
and
whom
you
loved
,
was
a
creature
capable
*NL*
of
a
crime
which
none
but
the
devil
himself
could
have
perpetrated
.
*NL*
Dear
William
!
dearest
blessed
child
!
I
soon
shall
see
you
again
in
*NL*
heaven
,
where
we
shall
all
be
happy
;
and
that
consoles
me
,
going
as
I
*NL*
am
to
suffer
ignominy
and
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Justine
!
Forgive
me
for
having
for
one
moment
distrusted
you
.
*NL*
Why
did
you
confess
?
But
do
not
mourn
,
dear
girl
.
Do
not
fear
.
I
*NL*
will
proclaim
,
I
will
prove
your
innocence

I
will
melt
the
stony
*NL*
hearts
of
your
enemies
by
my
tears
and
prayers
.
You
shall
not
die
!
*NL*
You
,
my
playfellow
,
my
companion
,
my
sister
,
perish
on
the
scaffold
!
*NL*
No
!
No
!
I
never
could
survive
so
horrible
a
misfortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Justine
shook
her
head
mournfully
.
``
I
do
not
fear
to
die
,
''
she
said
;
*NL*
``
that
pang
is
past
.
God
raises
my
weakness
and
gives
me
courage
to
*NL*
endure
the
worst
.
I
leave
a
sad
and
bitter
world
;
and
if
you
remember
*NL*
me
and
think
of
me
as
of
one
unjustly
condemned
,
I
am
resigned
to
the
*NL*
fate
awaiting
me
.
Learn
from
me
,
dear
lady
,
to
submit
in
patience
to
*NL*
the
will
of
heaven
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
conversation
I
had
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
prison
room
,
*NL*
where
I
could
conceal
the
horrid
anguish
that
possessed
me
.
Despair
!
*NL*
Who
dared
talk
of
that
?
The
poor
victim
,
who
on
the
morrow
was
to
pass
*NL*
the
awful
boundary
between
life
and
death
,
felt
not
,
as
I
did
,
such
*NL*
deep
and
bitter
agony
.
I
gnashed
my
teeth
and
ground
them
together
,
*NL*
uttering
a
groan
that
came
from
my
inmost
soul
.
Justine
started
.
When
*NL*
she
saw
who
it
was
,
she
approached
me
and
said
,
``
Dear
sir
,
you
are
very
*NL*
kind
to
visit
me
;
you
,
I
hope
,
do
not
believe
that
I
am
guilty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
answer
.
``
No
,
Justine
,
''
said
Elizabeth
;
``
he
is
more
*NL*
convinced
of
your
innocence
than
I
was
,
for
even
when
he
heard
that
you
*NL*
had
confessed
,
he
did
not
credit
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
truly
thank
him
.
In
these
last
moments
I
feel
the
sincerest
*NL*
gratitude
towards
those
who
think
of
me
with
kindness
.
How
sweet
is
*NL*
the
affection
of
others
to
such
a
wretch
as
I
am
!
It
removes
more
than
*NL*
half
my
misfortune
,
and
I
feel
as
if
I
could
die
in
peace
now
that
my
*NL*
innocence
is
acknowledged
by
you
,
dear
lady
,
and
your
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
poor
sufferer
tried
to
comfort
others
and
herself
.
She
indeed
*NL*
gained
the
resignation
she
desired
.
But
I
,
the
true
murderer
,
felt
the
*NL*
never-dying
worm
alive
in
my
bosom
,
which
allowed
of
no
hope
or
*NL*
consolation
.
Elizabeth
also
wept
and
was
unhappy
,
but
hers
also
was
*NL*
the
misery
of
innocence
,
which
,
like
a
cloud
that
passes
over
the
fair
*NL*
moon
,
for
a
while
hides
but
can
not
tarnish
its
brightness
.
Anguish
and
*NL*
despair
had
penetrated
into
the
core
of
my
heart
;
I
bore
a
hell
within
*NL*
me
which
nothing
could
extinguish
.
We
stayed
several
hours
with
*NL*
Justine
,
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
Elizabeth
could
tear
*NL*
herself
away
.
``
I
wish
,
''
cried
she
,
``
that
I
were
to
die
with
you
;
I
*NL*
can
not
live
in
this
world
of
misery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Justine
assumed
an
air
of
cheerfulness
,
while
she
with
difficulty
*NL*
repressed
her
bitter
tears
.
She
embraced
Elizabeth
and
said
in
a
voice
*NL*
of
half-suppressed
emotion
,
``
Farewell
,
sweet
lady
,
dearest
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
my
beloved
and
only
friend
;
may
heaven
,
in
its
bounty
,
bless
and
*NL*
preserve
you
;
may
this
be
the
last
misfortune
that
you
will
ever
*NL*
suffer
!
Live
,
and
be
happy
,
and
make
others
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
the
morrow
Justine
died
.
Elizabeth
's
heart-rending
eloquence
*NL*
failed
to
move
the
judges
from
their
settled
conviction
in
the
*NL*
criminality
of
the
saintly
sufferer
.
My
passionate
and
indignant
*NL*
appeals
were
lost
upon
them
.
And
when
I
received
their
cold
answers
*NL*
and
heard
the
harsh
,
unfeeling
reasoning
of
these
men
,
my
purposed
*NL*
avowal
died
away
on
my
lips
.
Thus
I
might
proclaim
myself
a
madman
,
*NL*
but
not
revoke
the
sentence
passed
upon
my
wretched
victim
.
She
*NL*
perished
on
the
scaffold
as
a
murderess
!
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
tortures
of
my
own
heart
,
I
turned
to
contemplate
the
deep
and
*NL*
voiceless
grief
of
my
Elizabeth
.
This
also
was
my
doing
!
And
my
*NL*
father
's
woe
,
and
the
desolation
of
that
late
so
smiling
home
all
was
*NL*
the
work
of
my
thrice-accursed
hands
!
Ye
weep
,
unhappy
ones
,
but
these
*NL*
are
not
your
last
tears
!
Again
shall
you
raise
the
funeral
wail
,
and
*NL*
the
sound
of
your
lamentations
shall
again
and
again
be
heard
!
*NL*
Frankenstein
,
your
son
,
your
kinsman
,
your
early
,
much-loved
friend
;
he
*NL*
who
would
spend
each
vital
drop
of
blood
for
your
sakes
,
who
has
no
*NL*
thought
nor
sense
of
joy
except
as
it
is
mirrored
also
in
your
dear
*NL*
countenances
,
who
would
fill
the
air
with
blessings
and
spend
his
life
*NL*
in
serving
you
--
he
bids
you
weep
,
to
shed
countless
tears
;
happy
beyond
*NL*
his
hopes
,
if
thus
inexorable
fate
be
satisfied
,
and
if
the
destruction
*NL*
pause
before
the
peace
of
the
grave
have
succeeded
to
your
sad
torments
!
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
spoke
my
prophetic
soul
,
as
,
torn
by
remorse
,
horror
,
and
despair
,
*NL*
I
beheld
those
I
loved
spend
vain
sorrow
upon
the
graves
of
William
and
*NL*
Justine
,
the
first
hapless
victims
to
my
unhallowed
arts
.

*NL*
Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
more
painful
to
the
human
mind
than
,
after
the
feelings
have
*NL*
been
worked
up
by
a
quick
succession
of
events
,
the
dead
calmness
of
*NL*
inaction
and
certainty
which
follows
and
deprives
the
soul
both
of
hope
*NL*
and
fear
.
Justine
died
,
she
rested
,
and
I
was
alive
.
The
blood
flowed
*NL*
freely
in
my
veins
,
but
a
weight
of
despair
and
remorse
pressed
on
my
*NL*
heart
which
nothing
could
remove
.
Sleep
fled
from
my
eyes
;
I
wandered
*NL*
like
an
evil
spirit
,
for
I
had
committed
deeds
of
mischief
beyond
*NL*
description
horrible
,
and
more
,
much
more
-LRB-
I
persuaded
myself
-RRB-
was
yet
*NL*
behind
.
Yet
my
heart
overflowed
with
kindness
and
the
love
of
virtue
.
*NL*
I
had
begun
life
with
benevolent
intentions
and
thirsted
for
the
moment
*NL*
when
I
should
put
them
in
practice
and
make
myself
useful
to
my
fellow
*NL*
beings
.
Now
all
was
blasted
;
instead
of
that
serenity
of
conscience
*NL*
which
allowed
me
to
look
back
upon
the
past
with
self-satisfaction
,
and
*NL*
from
thence
to
gather
promise
of
new
hopes
,
I
was
seized
by
remorse
and
*NL*
the
sense
of
guilt
,
which
hurried
me
away
to
a
hell
of
intense
tortures
*NL*
such
as
no
language
can
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
state
of
mind
preyed
upon
my
health
,
which
had
perhaps
never
*NL*
entirely
recovered
from
the
first
shock
it
had
sustained
.
I
shunned
*NL*
the
face
of
man
;
all
sound
of
joy
or
complacency
was
torture
to
me
;
*NL*
solitude
was
my
only
consolation
--
deep
,
dark
,
deathlike
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
observed
with
pain
the
alteration
perceptible
in
my
*NL*
disposition
and
habits
and
endeavoured
by
arguments
deduced
from
the
*NL*
feelings
of
his
serene
conscience
and
guiltless
life
to
inspire
me
with
*NL*
fortitude
and
awaken
in
me
the
courage
to
dispel
the
dark
cloud
which
*NL*
brooded
over
me
.
``
Do
you
think
,
Victor
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
I
do
not
*NL*
suffer
also
?
No
one
could
love
a
child
more
than
I
loved
your
*NL*
brother
''
--
tears
came
into
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
--
``
but
is
it
not
a
duty
*NL*
to
the
survivors
that
we
should
refrain
from
augmenting
their
*NL*
unhappiness
by
an
appearance
of
immoderate
grief
?
It
is
also
a
duty
*NL*
owed
to
yourself
,
for
excessive
sorrow
prevents
improvement
or
*NL*
enjoyment
,
or
even
the
discharge
of
daily
usefulness
,
without
which
no
*NL*
man
is
fit
for
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
advice
,
although
good
,
was
totally
inapplicable
to
my
case
;
I
*NL*
should
have
been
the
first
to
hide
my
grief
and
console
my
friends
if
*NL*
remorse
had
not
mingled
its
bitterness
,
and
terror
its
alarm
,
with
my
*NL*
other
sensations
.
Now
I
could
only
answer
my
father
with
a
look
of
*NL*
despair
and
endeavour
to
hide
myself
from
his
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
we
retired
to
our
house
at
Belrive
.
This
change
was
*NL*
particularly
agreeable
to
me
.
The
shutting
of
the
gates
regularly
at
*NL*
ten
o'clock
and
the
impossibility
of
remaining
on
the
lake
after
that
*NL*
hour
had
rendered
our
residence
within
the
walls
of
Geneva
very
irksome
*NL*
to
me
.
I
was
now
free
.
Often
,
after
the
rest
of
the
family
had
*NL*
retired
for
the
night
,
I
took
the
boat
and
passed
many
hours
upon
the
*NL*
water
.
Sometimes
,
with
my
sails
set
,
I
was
carried
by
the
wind
;
and
*NL*
sometimes
,
after
rowing
into
the
middle
of
the
lake
,
I
left
the
boat
to
*NL*
pursue
its
own
course
and
gave
way
to
my
own
miserable
reflections
.
I
*NL*
was
often
tempted
,
when
all
was
at
peace
around
me
,
and
I
the
only
*NL*
unquiet
thing
that
wandered
restless
in
a
scene
so
beautiful
and
*NL*
heavenly
--
if
I
except
some
bat
,
or
the
frogs
,
whose
harsh
and
*NL*
interrupted
croaking
was
heard
only
when
I
approached
the
shore
--
often
,
*NL*
I
say
,
I
was
tempted
to
plunge
into
the
silent
lake
,
that
the
waters
*NL*
might
close
over
me
and
my
calamities
forever
.
But
I
was
restrained
,
*NL*
when
I
thought
of
the
heroic
and
suffering
Elizabeth
,
whom
I
tenderly
*NL*
loved
,
and
whose
existence
was
bound
up
in
mine
.
I
thought
also
of
my
*NL*
father
and
surviving
brother
;
should
I
by
my
base
desertion
leave
them
*NL*
exposed
and
unprotected
to
the
malice
of
the
fiend
whom
I
had
let
loose
*NL*
among
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
moments
I
wept
bitterly
and
wished
that
peace
would
revisit
my
*NL*
mind
only
that
I
might
afford
them
consolation
and
happiness
.
But
that
*NL*
could
not
be
.
Remorse
extinguished
every
hope
.
I
had
been
the
author
*NL*
of
unalterable
evils
,
and
I
lived
in
daily
fear
lest
the
monster
whom
I
*NL*
had
created
should
perpetrate
some
new
wickedness
.
I
had
an
obscure
*NL*
feeling
that
all
was
not
over
and
that
he
would
still
commit
some
*NL*
signal
crime
,
which
by
its
enormity
should
almost
efface
the
*NL*
recollection
of
the
past
.
There
was
always
scope
for
fear
so
long
as
*NL*
anything
I
loved
remained
behind
.
My
abhorrence
of
this
fiend
can
not
*NL*
be
conceived
.
When
I
thought
of
him
I
gnashed
my
teeth
,
my
eyes
became
*NL*
inflamed
,
and
I
ardently
wished
to
extinguish
that
life
which
I
had
so
*NL*
thoughtlessly
bestowed
.
When
I
reflected
on
his
crimes
and
malice
,
my
*NL*
hatred
and
revenge
burst
all
bounds
of
moderation
.
I
would
have
made
a
*NL*
pilgrimage
to
the
highest
peak
of
the
Andes
,
could
I
when
there
have
*NL*
precipitated
him
to
their
base
.
I
wished
to
see
him
again
,
that
I
*NL*
might
wreak
the
utmost
extent
of
abhorrence
on
his
head
and
avenge
the
*NL*
deaths
of
William
and
Justine
.
Our
house
was
the
house
of
mourning
.
My
*NL*
father
's
health
was
deeply
shaken
by
the
horror
of
the
recent
events
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
was
sad
and
desponding
;
she
no
longer
took
delight
in
her
*NL*
ordinary
occupations
;
all
pleasure
seemed
to
her
sacrilege
toward
the
*NL*
dead
;
eternal
woe
and
tears
she
then
thought
was
the
just
tribute
she
*NL*
should
pay
to
innocence
so
blasted
and
destroyed
.
She
was
no
longer
*NL*
that
happy
creature
who
in
earlier
youth
wandered
with
me
on
the
banks
*NL*
of
the
lake
and
talked
with
ecstasy
of
our
future
prospects
.
The
first
*NL*
of
those
sorrows
which
are
sent
to
wean
us
from
the
earth
had
visited
*NL*
her
,
and
its
dimming
influence
quenched
her
dearest
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
reflect
,
my
dear
cousin
,
''
said
she
,
``
on
the
miserable
death
of
*NL*
Justine
Moritz
,
I
no
longer
see
the
world
and
its
works
as
they
before
*NL*
appeared
to
me
.
Before
,
I
looked
upon
the
accounts
of
vice
and
*NL*
injustice
that
I
read
in
books
or
heard
from
others
as
tales
of
ancient
*NL*
days
or
imaginary
evils
;
at
least
they
were
remote
and
more
familiar
to
*NL*
reason
than
to
the
imagination
;
but
now
misery
has
come
home
,
and
men
*NL*
appear
to
me
as
monsters
thirsting
for
each
other
's
blood
.
Yet
I
am
*NL*
certainly
unjust
.
Everybody
believed
that
poor
girl
to
be
guilty
;
and
*NL*
if
she
could
have
committed
the
crime
for
which
she
suffered
,
assuredly
*NL*
she
would
have
been
the
most
depraved
of
human
creatures
.
For
the
sake
*NL*
of
a
few
jewels
,
to
have
murdered
the
son
of
her
benefactor
and
friend
,
*NL*
a
child
whom
she
had
nursed
from
its
birth
,
and
appeared
to
love
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
her
own
!
I
could
not
consent
to
the
death
of
any
human
*NL*
being
,
but
certainly
I
should
have
thought
such
a
creature
unfit
to
*NL*
remain
in
the
society
of
men
.
But
she
was
innocent
.
I
know
,
I
feel
*NL*
she
was
innocent
;
you
are
of
the
same
opinion
,
and
that
confirms
me
.
*NL*
Alas
!
Victor
,
when
falsehood
can
look
so
like
the
truth
,
who
can
*NL*
assure
themselves
of
certain
happiness
?
I
feel
as
if
I
were
walking
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
a
precipice
,
towards
which
thousands
are
crowding
and
*NL*
endeavouring
to
plunge
me
into
the
abyss
.
William
and
Justine
were
*NL*
assassinated
,
and
the
murderer
escapes
;
he
walks
about
the
world
free
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
respected
.
But
even
if
I
were
condemned
to
suffer
on
the
*NL*
scaffold
for
the
same
crimes
,
I
would
not
change
places
with
such
a
*NL*
wretch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
listened
to
this
discourse
with
the
extremest
agony
.
I
,
not
in
deed
,
*NL*
but
in
effect
,
was
the
true
murderer
.
Elizabeth
read
my
anguish
in
my
*NL*
countenance
,
and
kindly
taking
my
hand
,
said
,
``
My
dearest
friend
,
you
*NL*
must
calm
yourself
.
These
events
have
affected
me
,
God
knows
how
*NL*
deeply
;
but
I
am
not
so
wretched
as
you
are
.
There
is
an
expression
of
*NL*
despair
,
and
sometimes
of
revenge
,
in
your
countenance
that
makes
me
*NL*
tremble
.
Dear
Victor
,
banish
these
dark
passions
.
Remember
the
*NL*
friends
around
you
,
who
centre
all
their
hopes
in
you
.
Have
we
lost
*NL*
the
power
of
rendering
you
happy
?
Ah
!
While
we
love
,
while
we
are
*NL*
true
to
each
other
,
here
in
this
land
of
peace
and
beauty
,
your
native
*NL*
country
,
we
may
reap
every
tranquil
blessing
--
what
can
disturb
our
*NL*
peace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
could
not
such
words
from
her
whom
I
fondly
prized
before
every
*NL*
other
gift
of
fortune
suffice
to
chase
away
the
fiend
that
lurked
in
my
*NL*
heart
?
Even
as
she
spoke
I
drew
near
to
her
,
as
if
in
terror
,
lest
at
*NL*
that
very
moment
the
destroyer
had
been
near
to
rob
me
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
not
the
tenderness
of
friendship
,
nor
the
beauty
of
earth
,
nor
of
*NL*
heaven
,
could
redeem
my
soul
from
woe
;
the
very
accents
of
love
were
*NL*
ineffectual
.
I
was
encompassed
by
a
cloud
which
no
beneficial
*NL*
influence
could
penetrate
.
The
wounded
deer
dragging
its
fainting
*NL*
limbs
to
some
untrodden
brake
,
there
to
gaze
upon
the
arrow
which
had
*NL*
pierced
it
,
and
to
die
,
was
but
a
type
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
I
could
cope
with
the
sullen
despair
that
overwhelmed
me
,
but
*NL*
sometimes
the
whirlwind
passions
of
my
soul
drove
me
to
seek
,
by
bodily
*NL*
exercise
and
by
change
of
place
,
some
relief
from
my
intolerable
*NL*
sensations
.
It
was
during
an
access
of
this
kind
that
I
suddenly
left
*NL*
my
home
,
and
bending
my
steps
towards
the
near
Alpine
valleys
,
sought
*NL*
in
the
magnificence
,
the
eternity
of
such
scenes
,
to
forget
myself
and
*NL*
my
ephemeral
,
because
human
,
sorrows
.
My
wanderings
were
directed
*NL*
towards
the
valley
of
Chamounix
.
I
had
visited
it
frequently
during
my
*NL*
boyhood
.
Six
years
had
passed
since
then
:
_
I
_
was
a
wreck
,
but
nought
*NL*
had
changed
in
those
savage
and
enduring
scenes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
performed
the
first
part
of
my
journey
on
horseback
.
I
afterwards
*NL*
hired
a
mule
,
as
the
more
sure-footed
and
least
liable
to
receive
*NL*
injury
on
these
rugged
roads
.
The
weather
was
fine
;
it
was
about
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
month
of
August
,
nearly
two
months
after
the
death
of
*NL*
Justine
,
that
miserable
epoch
from
which
I
dated
all
my
woe
.
The
*NL*
weight
upon
my
spirit
was
sensibly
lightened
as
I
plunged
yet
deeper
in
*NL*
the
ravine
of
Arve
.
The
immense
mountains
and
precipices
that
overhung
*NL*
me
on
every
side
,
the
sound
of
the
river
raging
among
the
rocks
,
and
*NL*
the
dashing
of
the
waterfalls
around
spoke
of
a
power
mighty
as
*NL*
Omnipotence
--
and
I
ceased
to
fear
or
to
bend
before
any
being
less
*NL*
almighty
than
that
which
had
created
and
ruled
the
elements
,
here
*NL*
displayed
in
their
most
terrific
guise
.
Still
,
as
I
ascended
higher
,
*NL*
the
valley
assumed
a
more
magnificent
and
astonishing
character
.
*NL*
Ruined
castles
hanging
on
the
precipices
of
piny
mountains
,
the
*NL*
impetuous
Arve
,
and
cottages
every
here
and
there
peeping
forth
from
*NL*
among
the
trees
formed
a
scene
of
singular
beauty
.
But
it
was
*NL*
augmented
and
rendered
sublime
by
the
mighty
Alps
,
whose
white
and
*NL*
shining
pyramids
and
domes
towered
above
all
,
as
belonging
to
another
*NL*
earth
,
the
habitations
of
another
race
of
beings
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
the
bridge
of
Pelissier
,
where
the
ravine
,
which
the
river
*NL*
forms
,
opened
before
me
,
and
I
began
to
ascend
the
mountain
that
*NL*
overhangs
it
.
Soon
after
,
I
entered
the
valley
of
Chamounix
.
This
*NL*
valley
is
more
wonderful
and
sublime
,
but
not
so
beautiful
and
*NL*
picturesque
as
that
of
Servox
,
through
which
I
had
just
passed
.
The
*NL*
high
and
snowy
mountains
were
its
immediate
boundaries
,
but
I
saw
no
*NL*
more
ruined
castles
and
fertile
fields
.
Immense
glaciers
approached
*NL*
the
road
;
I
heard
the
rumbling
thunder
of
the
falling
avalanche
and
*NL*
marked
the
smoke
of
its
passage
.
Mont
Blanc
,
the
supreme
and
*NL*
magnificent
Mont
Blanc
,
raised
itself
from
the
surrounding
aiguilles
,
*NL*
and
its
tremendous
dome
overlooked
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tingling
long-lost
sense
of
pleasure
often
came
across
me
during
this
*NL*
journey
.
Some
turn
in
the
road
,
some
new
object
suddenly
perceived
and
*NL*
recognized
,
reminded
me
of
days
gone
by
,
and
were
associated
with
the
*NL*
lighthearted
gaiety
of
boyhood
.
The
very
winds
whispered
in
soothing
*NL*
accents
,
and
maternal
Nature
bade
me
weep
no
more
.
Then
again
the
*NL*
kindly
influence
ceased
to
act
--
I
found
myself
fettered
again
to
grief
*NL*
and
indulging
in
all
the
misery
of
reflection
.
Then
I
spurred
on
my
*NL*
animal
,
striving
so
to
forget
the
world
,
my
fears
,
and
more
than
all
,
*NL*
myself
--
or
,
in
a
more
desperate
fashion
,
I
alighted
and
threw
myself
on
*NL*
the
grass
,
weighed
down
by
horror
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
I
arrived
at
the
village
of
Chamounix
.
Exhaustion
succeeded
*NL*
to
the
extreme
fatigue
both
of
body
and
of
mind
which
I
had
endured
.
*NL*
For
a
short
space
of
time
I
remained
at
the
window
watching
the
pallid
*NL*
lightnings
that
played
above
Mont
Blanc
and
listening
to
the
rushing
of
*NL*
the
Arve
,
which
pursued
its
noisy
way
beneath
.
The
same
lulling
sounds
*NL*
acted
as
a
lullaby
to
my
too
keen
sensations
;
when
I
placed
my
head
*NL*
upon
my
pillow
,
sleep
crept
over
me
;
I
felt
it
as
it
came
and
blessed
*NL*
the
giver
of
oblivion
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
I
spent
the
following
day
roaming
through
the
valley
.
I
stood
beside
*NL*
the
sources
of
the
Arveiron
,
which
take
their
rise
in
a
glacier
,
that
*NL*
with
slow
pace
is
advancing
down
from
the
summit
of
the
hills
to
*NL*
barricade
the
valley
.
The
abrupt
sides
of
vast
mountains
were
before
*NL*
me
;
the
icy
wall
of
the
glacier
overhung
me
;
a
few
shattered
pines
were
*NL*
scattered
around
;
and
the
solemn
silence
of
this
glorious
*NL*
presence-chamber
of
imperial
nature
was
broken
only
by
the
brawling
*NL*
waves
or
the
fall
of
some
vast
fragment
,
the
thunder
sound
of
the
*NL*
avalanche
or
the
cracking
,
reverberated
along
the
mountains
,
of
the
*NL*
accumulated
ice
,
which
,
through
the
silent
working
of
immutable
laws
,
*NL*
was
ever
and
anon
rent
and
torn
,
as
if
it
had
been
but
a
plaything
in
*NL*
their
hands
.
These
sublime
and
magnificent
scenes
afforded
me
the
*NL*
greatest
consolation
that
I
was
capable
of
receiving
.
They
elevated
me
*NL*
from
all
littleness
of
feeling
,
and
although
they
did
not
remove
my
*NL*
grief
,
they
subdued
and
tranquillized
it
.
In
some
degree
,
also
,
they
*NL*
diverted
my
mind
from
the
thoughts
over
which
it
had
brooded
for
the
*NL*
last
month
.
I
retired
to
rest
at
night
;
my
slumbers
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
waited
on
and
ministered
to
by
the
assemblance
of
grand
shapes
which
I
*NL*
had
contemplated
during
the
day
.
They
congregated
round
me
;
the
*NL*
unstained
snowy
mountain-top
,
the
glittering
pinnacle
,
the
pine
woods
,
*NL*
and
ragged
bare
ravine
,
the
eagle
,
soaring
amidst
the
clouds
--
they
all
*NL*
gathered
round
me
and
bade
me
be
at
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
had
they
fled
when
the
next
morning
I
awoke
?
All
of
*NL*
soul-inspiriting
fled
with
sleep
,
and
dark
melancholy
clouded
every
*NL*
thought
.
The
rain
was
pouring
in
torrents
,
and
thick
mists
hid
the
*NL*
summits
of
the
mountains
,
so
that
I
even
saw
not
the
faces
of
those
*NL*
mighty
friends
.
Still
I
would
penetrate
their
misty
veil
and
seek
them
*NL*
in
their
cloudy
retreats
.
What
were
rain
and
storm
to
me
?
My
mule
was
*NL*
brought
to
the
door
,
and
I
resolved
to
ascend
to
the
summit
of
*NL*
Montanvert
.
I
remembered
the
effect
that
the
view
of
the
tremendous
*NL*
and
ever-moving
glacier
had
produced
upon
my
mind
when
I
first
saw
it
.
*NL*
It
had
then
filled
me
with
a
sublime
ecstasy
that
gave
wings
to
the
*NL*
soul
and
allowed
it
to
soar
from
the
obscure
world
to
light
and
joy
.
*NL*
The
sight
of
the
awful
and
majestic
in
nature
had
indeed
always
the
*NL*
effect
of
solemnizing
my
mind
and
causing
me
to
forget
the
passing
*NL*
cares
of
life
.
I
determined
to
go
without
a
guide
,
for
I
was
well
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
path
,
and
the
presence
of
another
would
destroy
the
*NL*
solitary
grandeur
of
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ascent
is
precipitous
,
but
the
path
is
cut
into
continual
and
short
*NL*
windings
,
which
enable
you
to
surmount
the
perpendicularity
of
the
*NL*
mountain
.
It
is
a
scene
terrifically
desolate
.
In
a
thousand
spots
*NL*
the
traces
of
the
winter
avalanche
may
be
perceived
,
where
trees
lie
*NL*
broken
and
strewed
on
the
ground
,
some
entirely
destroyed
,
others
bent
,
*NL*
leaning
upon
the
jutting
rocks
of
the
mountain
or
transversely
upon
*NL*
other
trees
.
The
path
,
as
you
ascend
higher
,
is
intersected
by
ravines
*NL*
of
snow
,
down
which
stones
continually
roll
from
above
;
one
of
them
is
*NL*
particularly
dangerous
,
as
the
slightest
sound
,
such
as
even
speaking
*NL*
in
a
loud
voice
,
produces
a
concussion
of
air
sufficient
to
draw
*NL*
destruction
upon
the
head
of
the
speaker
.
The
pines
are
not
tall
or
*NL*
luxuriant
,
but
they
are
sombre
and
add
an
air
of
severity
to
the
scene
.
*NL*
I
looked
on
the
valley
beneath
;
vast
mists
were
rising
from
the
rivers
*NL*
which
ran
through
it
and
curling
in
thick
wreaths
around
the
opposite
*NL*
mountains
,
whose
summits
were
hid
in
the
uniform
clouds
,
while
rain
*NL*
poured
from
the
dark
sky
and
added
to
the
melancholy
impression
I
*NL*
received
from
the
objects
around
me
.
Alas
!
Why
does
man
boast
of
*NL*
sensibilities
superior
to
those
apparent
in
the
brute
;
it
only
renders
*NL*
them
more
necessary
beings
.
If
our
impulses
were
confined
to
hunger
,
*NL*
thirst
,
and
desire
,
we
might
be
nearly
free
;
but
now
we
are
moved
by
*NL*
every
wind
that
blows
and
a
chance
word
or
scene
that
that
word
may
*NL*
convey
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
rest
;
a
dream
has
power
to
poison
sleep
.
*NL*
We
rise
;
one
wand
`
ring
thought
pollutes
the
day
.
*NL*
We
feel
,
conceive
,
or
reason
;
laugh
or
weep
,
*NL*
Embrace
fond
woe
,
or
cast
our
cares
away
;
*NL*
It
is
the
same
:
for
,
be
it
joy
or
sorrow
,
*NL*
The
path
of
its
departure
still
is
free
.
*NL*
Man
's
yesterday
may
ne'er
be
like
his
morrow
;
*NL*
Nought
may
endure
but
mutability
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
noon
when
I
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
ascent
.
For
some
*NL*
time
I
sat
upon
the
rock
that
overlooks
the
sea
of
ice
.
A
mist
covered
*NL*
both
that
and
the
surrounding
mountains
.
Presently
a
breeze
dissipated
*NL*
the
cloud
,
and
I
descended
upon
the
glacier
.
The
surface
is
very
*NL*
uneven
,
rising
like
the
waves
of
a
troubled
sea
,
descending
low
,
and
*NL*
interspersed
by
rifts
that
sink
deep
.
The
field
of
ice
is
almost
a
*NL*
league
in
width
,
but
I
spent
nearly
two
hours
in
crossing
it
.
The
*NL*
opposite
mountain
is
a
bare
perpendicular
rock
.
From
the
side
where
I
*NL*
now
stood
Montanvert
was
exactly
opposite
,
at
the
distance
of
a
league
;
*NL*
and
above
it
rose
Mont
Blanc
,
in
awful
majesty
.
I
remained
in
a
recess
*NL*
of
the
rock
,
gazing
on
this
wonderful
and
stupendous
scene
.
The
sea
,
*NL*
or
rather
the
vast
river
of
ice
,
wound
among
its
dependent
mountains
,
*NL*
whose
aerial
summits
hung
over
its
recesses
.
Their
icy
and
glittering
*NL*
peaks
shone
in
the
sunlight
over
the
clouds
.
My
heart
,
which
was
*NL*
before
sorrowful
,
now
swelled
with
something
like
joy
;
I
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
Wandering
spirits
,
if
indeed
ye
wander
,
and
do
not
rest
in
your
narrow
*NL*
beds
,
allow
me
this
faint
happiness
,
or
take
me
,
as
your
companion
,
*NL*
away
from
the
joys
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
said
this
I
suddenly
beheld
the
figure
of
a
man
,
at
some
distance
,
*NL*
advancing
towards
me
with
superhuman
speed
.
He
bounded
over
the
*NL*
crevices
in
the
ice
,
among
which
I
had
walked
with
caution
;
his
*NL*
stature
,
also
,
as
he
approached
,
seemed
to
exceed
that
of
man
.
I
was
*NL*
troubled
;
a
mist
came
over
my
eyes
,
and
I
felt
a
faintness
seize
me
,
*NL*
but
I
was
quickly
restored
by
the
cold
gale
of
the
mountains
.
I
*NL*
perceived
,
as
the
shape
came
nearer
-LRB-
sight
tremendous
and
abhorred
!
-RRB-
*NL*
that
it
was
the
wretch
whom
I
had
created
.
I
trembled
with
rage
and
*NL*
horror
,
resolving
to
wait
his
approach
and
then
close
with
him
in
*NL*
mortal
combat
.
He
approached
;
his
countenance
bespoke
bitter
anguish
,
*NL*
combined
with
disdain
and
malignity
,
while
its
unearthly
ugliness
*NL*
rendered
it
almost
too
horrible
for
human
eyes
.
But
I
scarcely
*NL*
observed
this
;
rage
and
hatred
had
at
first
deprived
me
of
utterance
,
*NL*
and
I
recovered
only
to
overwhelm
him
with
words
expressive
of
furious
*NL*
detestation
and
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
,
''
I
exclaimed
,
``
do
you
dare
approach
me
?
And
do
not
you
fear
*NL*
the
fierce
vengeance
of
my
arm
wreaked
on
your
miserable
head
?
Begone
,
*NL*
vile
insect
!
Or
rather
,
stay
,
that
I
may
trample
you
to
dust
!
And
,
*NL*
oh
!
That
I
could
,
with
the
extinction
of
your
miserable
existence
,
*NL*
restore
those
victims
whom
you
have
so
diabolically
murdered
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
this
reception
,
''
said
the
daemon
.
``
All
men
hate
the
*NL*
wretched

how
,
then
,
must
I
be
hated

*NL*
living
things

Yet
you

thou
art
bound

annihilation

Do

I

you

I
will
glut

I

so
negligently

*NL*
*NL*
My
rage
was
without
bounds
;
I
sprang
on
him
,
impelled
by
all
the
*NL*
feelings
which
can
arm
one
being
against
the
existence
of
another

*NL*
*NL*
He
easily
eluded
me
and
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
calm

it
may
only
be
an
accumulation
of

is
dear

me

and
I
will
defend
it
.
Remember
,
thou
hast
made

me
more
powerful
than
thyself
;
my
height
is
superior
to
thine

my
*NL*
joints
more
supple

But
I
will
not
be
tempted
to
set
myself
in

opposition

thee

I
am
thy

I
will
be
even
mild

docile

my
natural

wilt
also
perform

thy

is
most
due

Remember
that
I
am
thy

I
am
rather
the
fallen

drivest
from
joy

Everywhere
I
see
bliss

from
which
I

alone
am
irrevocably
excluded

I
was
benevolent

good

misery
made

a

Make

I

again
be

*NL*
``
Begone

Begone

Believe

I
was
benevolent
;
my
soul
glowed
*NL*
with
love

humanity

but
am
I
not

miserably
alone

You

abhor

can
I
gather
from
your

owe
me
nothing

They
spurn

hate

The
desert

I
have
wandered
here
many

the

caves

ice

I
only
do
not
fear

are
a
dwelling

me

the
*NL*
only
one
which
man
does
not
grudge

These
bleak

I
hail

kinder

If

they
would
do

you
do

arm
themselves

Shall
I
not

abhor
me

keep
*NL*
no

I
am
miserable

Yet
it
is
in
your
power
to
recompense
me

and
deliver
*NL*
them
from
an
evil
which
it
only
remains
for
you
to
make
so
great
,
that
*NL*
not

you

thousands

Listen

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
I
relieve
thee

''
he
said
,
and
placed
his
hated
hands
*NL*
before
my
eyes
,
which
I
flung
from
me
with
violence
;
``
thus
I
take
from

thee

Still
thou

me
thy
compassion

By
the
virtues
that
I
once
possessed
,
I
demand
this
*NL*
from
you

Hear
my
tale

it
is
long
and
strange
,
and
the
temperature
of
*NL*
this
place
is
not
fitting
to
your
fine
sensations
;
come
to
the
hut

*NL*
the
mountain

The
sun
is
yet
high
in
the

before
it
descends
*NL*
to
hide
itself
behind
your
snowy
precipices
and
illuminate
another
*NL*
world
,
you
will
have
heard
my
story
and
can
decide
.
On
you
it
rests
,
*NL*
whether
I
quit
forever
the
neighbourhood
of
man
and
lead
a
harmless
*NL*
life
,
or
become
the
scourge
of
your
fellow
creatures
and
the
author
of
*NL*
your
own
speedy
ruin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
he
led
the
way
across
the
ice
;
I
followed
.
My
heart
*NL*
was
full
,
and
I
did
not
answer
him
,
but
as
I
proceeded
,
I
weighed
the
*NL*
various
arguments
that
he
had
used
and
determined
at
least
to
listen
to
*NL*
his
tale
.
I
was
partly
urged
by
curiosity
,
and
compassion
confirmed
my
*NL*
resolution
.
I
had
hitherto
supposed
him
to
be
the
murderer
of
my
*NL*
brother
,
and
I
eagerly
sought
a
confirmation
or
denial
of
this
opinion
.
*NL*
For
the
first
time
,
also
,
I
felt
what
the
duties
of
a
creator
towards
*NL*
his
creature
were
,
and
that
I
ought
to
render
him
happy
before
I
*NL*
complained
of
his
wickedness
.
These
motives
urged
me
to
comply
with
*NL*
his
demand
.
We
crossed
the
ice
,
therefore
,
and
ascended
the
opposite
*NL*
rock
.
The
air
was
cold
,
and
the
rain
again
began
to
descend
;
we
*NL*
entered
the
hut
,
the
fiend
with
an
air
of
exultation
,
I
with
a
heavy
*NL*
heart
and
depressed
spirits
.
But
I
consented
to
listen
,
and
seating
*NL*
myself
by
the
fire
which
my
odious
companion
had
lighted
,
he
thus
began
*NL*
his
tale
.

*NL*
``
It
is
with
considerable
difficulty
that
I
remember
the
original
era
of
*NL*
my
being
;
all
the
events
of
that
period
appear
confused
and
indistinct
.
*NL*
A
strange
multiplicity
of
sensations
seized
me
,
and
I
saw
,
felt
,
heard
,
*NL*
and
smelt
at
the
same
time
;
and
it
was
,
indeed
,
a
long
time
before
I
*NL*
learned
to
distinguish
between
the
operations
of
my
various
senses
.
By
*NL*
degrees
,
I
remember
,
a
stronger
light
pressed
upon
my
nerves
,
so
that
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
shut
my
eyes
.
Darkness
then
came
over
me
and
troubled
*NL*
me
,
but
hardly
had
I
felt
this
when
,
by
opening
my
eyes
,
as
I
now
*NL*
suppose
,
the
light
poured
in
upon
me
again
.
I
walked
and
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
descended
,
but
I
presently
found
a
great
alteration
in
my
sensations
.
*NL*
Before
,
dark
and
opaque
bodies
had
surrounded
me
,
impervious
to
my
*NL*
touch
or
sight
;
but
I
now
found
that
I
could
wander
on
at
liberty
,
with
*NL*
no
obstacles
which
I
could
not
either
surmount
or
avoid
.
The
light
*NL*
became
more
and
more
oppressive
to
me
,
and
the
heat
wearying
me
as
I
*NL*
walked
,
I
sought
a
place
where
I
could
receive
shade
.
This
was
the
*NL*
forest
near
Ingolstadt
;
and
here
I
lay
by
the
side
of
a
brook
resting
*NL*
from
my
fatigue
,
until
I
felt
tormented
by
hunger
and
thirst
.
This
*NL*
roused
me
from
my
nearly
dormant
state
,
and
I
ate
some
berries
which
I
*NL*
found
hanging
on
the
trees
or
lying
on
the
ground
.
I
slaked
my
thirst
*NL*
at
the
brook
,
and
then
lying
down
,
was
overcome
by
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
dark
when
I
awoke
;
I
felt
cold
also
,
and
half
frightened
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
instinctively
,
finding
myself
so
desolate
.
Before
I
had
quitted
*NL*
your
apartment
,
on
a
sensation
of
cold
,
I
had
covered
myself
with
some
*NL*
clothes
,
but
these
were
insufficient
to
secure
me
from
the
dews
of
*NL*
night
.
I
was
a
poor
,
helpless
,
miserable
wretch
;
I
knew
,
and
could
*NL*
distinguish
,
nothing
;
but
feeling
pain
invade
me
on
all
sides
,
I
sat
*NL*
down
and
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
a
gentle
light
stole
over
the
heavens
and
gave
me
a
sensation
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
I
started
up
and
beheld
a
radiant
form
rise
from
among
the
*NL*
trees
.
-LSB-
The
moon
-RSB-
I
gazed
with
a
kind
of
wonder
.
It
moved
slowly
,
*NL*
but
it
enlightened
my
path
,
and
I
again
went
out
in
search
of
berries
.
*NL*
I
was
still
cold
when
under
one
of
the
trees
I
found
a
huge
cloak
,
with
*NL*
which
I
covered
myself
,
and
sat
down
upon
the
ground
.
No
distinct
*NL*
ideas
occupied
my
mind
;
all
was
confused
.
I
felt
light
,
and
hunger
,
*NL*
and
thirst
,
and
darkness
;
innumerable
sounds
rang
in
my
ears
,
and
on
*NL*
all
sides
various
scents
saluted
me
;
the
only
object
that
I
could
*NL*
distinguish
was
the
bright
moon
,
and
I
fixed
my
eyes
on
that
with
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Several
changes
of
day
and
night
passed
,
and
the
orb
of
night
had
*NL*
greatly
lessened
,
when
I
began
to
distinguish
my
sensations
from
each
*NL*
other
.
I
gradually
saw
plainly
the
clear
stream
that
supplied
me
with
*NL*
drink
and
the
trees
that
shaded
me
with
their
foliage
.
I
was
delighted
*NL*
when
I
first
discovered
that
a
pleasant
sound
,
which
often
saluted
my
*NL*
ears
,
proceeded
from
the
throats
of
the
little
winged
animals
who
had
*NL*
often
intercepted
the
light
from
my
eyes
.
I
began
also
to
observe
,
*NL*
with
greater
accuracy
,
the
forms
that
surrounded
me
and
to
perceive
the
*NL*
boundaries
of
the
radiant
roof
of
light
which
canopied
me
.
Sometimes
I
*NL*
tried
to
imitate
the
pleasant
songs
of
the
birds
but
was
unable
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
wished
to
express
my
sensations
in
my
own
mode
,
but
the
*NL*
uncouth
and
inarticulate
sounds
which
broke
from
me
frightened
me
into
*NL*
silence
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
moon
had
disappeared
from
the
night
,
and
again
,
with
a
lessened
*NL*
form
,
showed
itself
,
while
I
still
remained
in
the
forest
.
My
*NL*
sensations
had
by
this
time
become
distinct
,
and
my
mind
received
every
*NL*
day
additional
ideas
.
My
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
light
and
to
*NL*
perceive
objects
in
their
right
forms
;
I
distinguished
the
insect
from
*NL*
the
herb
,
and
by
degrees
,
one
herb
from
another
.
I
found
that
the
*NL*
sparrow
uttered
none
but
harsh
notes
,
whilst
those
of
the
blackbird
and
*NL*
thrush
were
sweet
and
enticing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
,
when
I
was
oppressed
by
cold
,
I
found
a
fire
which
had
been
*NL*
left
by
some
wandering
beggars
,
and
was
overcome
with
delight
at
the
*NL*
warmth
I
experienced
from
it
.
In
my
joy
I
thrust
my
hand
into
the
live
*NL*
embers
,
but
quickly
drew
it
out
again
with
a
cry
of
pain
.
How
strange
,
*NL*
I
thought
,
that
the
same
cause
should
produce
such
opposite
effects
!
I
*NL*
examined
the
materials
of
the
fire
,
and
to
my
joy
found
it
to
be
*NL*
composed
of
wood
.
I
quickly
collected
some
branches
,
but
they
were
wet
*NL*
and
would
not
burn
.
I
was
pained
at
this
and
sat
still
watching
the
*NL*
operation
of
the
fire
.
The
wet
wood
which
I
had
placed
near
the
heat
*NL*
dried
and
itself
became
inflamed
.
I
reflected
on
this
,
and
by
touching
*NL*
the
various
branches
,
I
discovered
the
cause
and
busied
myself
in
*NL*
collecting
a
great
quantity
of
wood
,
that
I
might
dry
it
and
have
a
*NL*
plentiful
supply
of
fire
.
When
night
came
on
and
brought
sleep
with
*NL*
it
,
I
was
in
the
greatest
fear
lest
my
fire
should
be
extinguished
.
I
*NL*
covered
it
carefully
with
dry
wood
and
leaves
and
placed
wet
branches
*NL*
upon
it
;
and
then
,
spreading
my
cloak
,
I
lay
on
the
ground
and
sank
*NL*
into
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
morning
when
I
awoke
,
and
my
first
care
was
to
visit
the
fire
.
*NL*
I
uncovered
it
,
and
a
gentle
breeze
quickly
fanned
it
into
a
flame
.
I
*NL*
observed
this
also
and
contrived
a
fan
of
branches
,
which
roused
the
*NL*
embers
when
they
were
nearly
extinguished
.
When
night
came
again
I
*NL*
found
,
with
pleasure
,
that
the
fire
gave
light
as
well
as
heat
and
that
*NL*
the
discovery
of
this
element
was
useful
to
me
in
my
food
,
for
I
found
*NL*
some
of
the
offals
that
the
travellers
had
left
had
been
roasted
,
and
*NL*
tasted
much
more
savoury
than
the
berries
I
gathered
from
the
trees
.
I
*NL*
tried
,
therefore
,
to
dress
my
food
in
the
same
manner
,
placing
it
on
*NL*
the
live
embers
.
I
found
that
the
berries
were
spoiled
by
this
*NL*
operation
,
and
the
nuts
and
roots
much
improved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Food
,
however
,
became
scarce
,
and
I
often
spent
the
whole
day
*NL*
searching
in
vain
for
a
few
acorns
to
assuage
the
pangs
of
hunger
.
When
*NL*
I
found
this
,
I
resolved
to
quit
the
place
that
I
had
hitherto
*NL*
inhabited
,
to
seek
for
one
where
the
few
wants
I
experienced
would
be
*NL*
more
easily
satisfied
.
In
this
emigration
I
exceedingly
lamented
the
*NL*
loss
of
the
fire
which
I
had
obtained
through
accident
and
knew
not
how
*NL*
to
reproduce
it
.
I
gave
several
hours
to
the
serious
consideration
of
*NL*
this
difficulty
,
but
I
was
obliged
to
relinquish
all
attempt
to
supply
*NL*
it
,
and
wrapping
myself
up
in
my
cloak
,
I
struck
across
the
wood
*NL*
towards
the
setting
sun
.
I
passed
three
days
in
these
rambles
and
at
*NL*
length
discovered
the
open
country
.
A
great
fall
of
snow
had
taken
*NL*
place
the
night
before
,
and
the
fields
were
of
one
uniform
white
;
the
*NL*
appearance
was
disconsolate
,
and
I
found
my
feet
chilled
by
the
cold
*NL*
damp
substance
that
covered
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
about
seven
in
the
morning
,
and
I
longed
to
obtain
food
and
*NL*
shelter
;
at
length
I
perceived
a
small
hut
,
on
a
rising
ground
,
which
*NL*
had
doubtless
been
built
for
the
convenience
of
some
shepherd
.
This
*NL*
was
a
new
sight
to
me
,
and
I
examined
the
structure
with
great
*NL*
curiosity
.
Finding
the
door
open
,
I
entered
.
An
old
man
sat
in
it
,
*NL*
near
a
fire
,
over
which
he
was
preparing
his
breakfast
.
He
turned
on
*NL*
hearing
a
noise
,
and
perceiving
me
,
shrieked
loudly
,
and
quitting
the
*NL*
hut
,
ran
across
the
fields
with
a
speed
of
which
his
debilitated
form
*NL*
hardly
appeared
capable
.
His
appearance
,
different
from
any
I
had
ever
*NL*
before
seen
,
and
his
flight
somewhat
surprised
me
.
But
I
was
enchanted
*NL*
by
the
appearance
of
the
hut
;
here
the
snow
and
rain
could
not
*NL*
penetrate
;
the
ground
was
dry
;
and
it
presented
to
me
then
as
exquisite
*NL*
and
divine
a
retreat
as
Pandemonium
appeared
to
the
demons
of
hell
*NL*
after
their
sufferings
in
the
lake
of
fire
.
I
greedily
devoured
the
*NL*
remnants
of
the
shepherd
's
breakfast
,
which
consisted
of
bread
,
cheese
,
*NL*
milk
,
and
wine
;
the
latter
,
however
,
I
did
not
like
.
Then
,
overcome
by
*NL*
fatigue
,
I
lay
down
among
some
straw
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
noon
when
I
awoke
,
and
allured
by
the
warmth
of
the
sun
,
which
*NL*
shone
brightly
on
the
white
ground
,
I
determined
to
recommence
my
*NL*
travels
;
and
,
depositing
the
remains
of
the
peasant
's
breakfast
in
a
*NL*
wallet
I
found
,
I
proceeded
across
the
fields
for
several
hours
,
until
*NL*
at
sunset
I
arrived
at
a
village
.
How
miraculous
did
this
appear
!
The
*NL*
huts
,
the
neater
cottages
,
and
stately
houses
engaged
my
admiration
by
*NL*
turns
.
The
vegetables
in
the
gardens
,
the
milk
and
cheese
that
I
saw
*NL*
placed
at
the
windows
of
some
of
the
cottages
,
allured
my
appetite
.
One
*NL*
of
the
best
of
these
I
entered
,
but
I
had
hardly
placed
my
foot
within
*NL*
the
door
before
the
children
shrieked
,
and
one
of
the
women
fainted
.
*NL*
The
whole
village
was
roused
;
some
fled
,
some
attacked
me
,
until
,
*NL*
grievously
bruised
by
stones
and
many
other
kinds
of
missile
weapons
,
I
*NL*
escaped
to
the
open
country
and
fearfully
took
refuge
in
a
low
hovel
,
*NL*
quite
bare
,
and
making
a
wretched
appearance
after
the
palaces
I
had
*NL*
beheld
in
the
village
.
This
hovel
however
,
joined
a
cottage
of
a
neat
*NL*
and
pleasant
appearance
,
but
after
my
late
dearly
bought
experience
,
I
*NL*
dared
not
enter
it
.
My
place
of
refuge
was
constructed
of
wood
,
but
so
*NL*
low
that
I
could
with
difficulty
sit
upright
in
it
.
No
wood
,
however
,
*NL*
was
placed
on
the
earth
,
which
formed
the
floor
,
but
it
was
dry
;
and
*NL*
although
the
wind
entered
it
by
innumerable
chinks
,
I
found
it
an
*NL*
agreeable
asylum
from
the
snow
and
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
then
,
I
retreated
and
lay
down
happy
to
have
found
a
shelter
,
*NL*
however
miserable
,
from
the
inclemency
of
the
season
,
and
still
more
*NL*
from
the
barbarity
of
man
.
As
soon
as
morning
dawned
I
crept
from
my
*NL*
kennel
,
that
I
might
view
the
adjacent
cottage
and
discover
if
I
could
*NL*
remain
in
the
habitation
I
had
found
.
It
was
situated
against
the
back
*NL*
of
the
cottage
and
surrounded
on
the
sides
which
were
exposed
by
a
pig
*NL*
sty
and
a
clear
pool
of
water
.
One
part
was
open
,
and
by
that
I
had
*NL*
crept
in
;
but
now
I
covered
every
crevice
by
which
I
might
be
perceived
*NL*
with
stones
and
wood
,
yet
in
such
a
manner
that
I
might
move
them
on
*NL*
occasion
to
pass
out
;
all
the
light
I
enjoyed
came
through
the
sty
,
and
*NL*
that
was
sufficient
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
thus
arranged
my
dwelling
and
carpeted
it
with
clean
straw
,
I
*NL*
retired
,
for
I
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
at
a
distance
,
and
I
remembered
*NL*
too
well
my
treatment
the
night
before
to
trust
myself
in
his
power
.
I
*NL*
had
first
,
however
,
provided
for
my
sustenance
for
that
day
by
a
loaf
*NL*
of
coarse
bread
,
which
I
purloined
,
and
a
cup
with
which
I
could
drink
*NL*
more
conveniently
than
from
my
hand
of
the
pure
water
which
flowed
by
*NL*
my
retreat
.
The
floor
was
a
little
raised
,
so
that
it
was
kept
*NL*
perfectly
dry
,
and
by
its
vicinity
to
the
chimney
of
the
cottage
it
was
*NL*
tolerably
warm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
thus
provided
,
I
resolved
to
reside
in
this
hovel
until
*NL*
something
should
occur
which
might
alter
my
determination
.
It
was
*NL*
indeed
a
paradise
compared
to
the
bleak
forest
,
my
former
residence
,
*NL*
the
rain-dropping
branches
,
and
dank
earth
.
I
ate
my
breakfast
with
*NL*
pleasure
and
was
about
to
remove
a
plank
to
procure
myself
a
little
*NL*
water
when
I
heard
a
step
,
and
looking
through
a
small
chink
,
I
beheld
*NL*
a
young
creature
,
with
a
pail
on
her
head
,
passing
before
my
hovel
.
The
*NL*
girl
was
young
and
of
gentle
demeanour
,
unlike
what
I
have
since
found
*NL*
cottagers
and
farmhouse
servants
to
be
.
Yet
she
was
meanly
dressed
,
a
*NL*
coarse
blue
petticoat
and
a
linen
jacket
being
her
only
garb
;
her
fair
*NL*
hair
was
plaited
but
not
adorned
:
she
looked
patient
yet
sad
.
I
lost
*NL*
sight
of
her
,
and
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
returned
bearing
*NL*
the
pail
,
which
was
now
partly
filled
with
milk
.
As
she
walked
along
,
*NL*
seemingly
incommoded
by
the
burden
,
a
young
man
met
her
,
whose
*NL*
countenance
expressed
a
deeper
despondence
.
Uttering
a
few
sounds
with
*NL*
an
air
of
melancholy
,
he
took
the
pail
from
her
head
and
bore
it
to
the
*NL*
cottage
himself
.
She
followed
,
and
they
disappeared
.
Presently
I
saw
*NL*
the
young
man
again
,
with
some
tools
in
his
hand
,
cross
the
field
*NL*
behind
the
cottage
;
and
the
girl
was
also
busied
,
sometimes
in
the
*NL*
house
and
sometimes
in
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
examining
my
dwelling
,
I
found
that
one
of
the
windows
of
the
*NL*
cottage
had
formerly
occupied
a
part
of
it
,
but
the
panes
had
been
*NL*
filled
up
with
wood
.
In
one
of
these
was
a
small
and
almost
*NL*
imperceptible
chink
through
which
the
eye
could
just
penetrate
.
*NL*
Through
this
crevice
a
small
room
was
visible
,
whitewashed
and
clean
*NL*
but
very
bare
of
furniture
.
In
one
corner
,
near
a
small
fire
,
sat
an
*NL*
old
man
,
leaning
his
head
on
his
hands
in
a
disconsolate
attitude
.
The
*NL*
young
girl
was
occupied
in
arranging
the
cottage
;
but
presently
she
*NL*
took
something
out
of
a
drawer
,
which
employed
her
hands
,
and
she
sat
*NL*
down
beside
the
old
man
,
who
,
taking
up
an
instrument
,
began
to
play
*NL*
and
to
produce
sounds
sweeter
than
the
voice
of
the
thrush
or
the
*NL*
nightingale
.
It
was
a
lovely
sight
,
even
to
me
,
poor
wretch
who
had
*NL*
never
beheld
aught
beautiful
before
.
The
silver
hair
and
benevolent
*NL*
countenance
of
the
aged
cottager
won
my
reverence
,
while
the
gentle
*NL*
manners
of
the
girl
enticed
my
love
.
He
played
a
sweet
mournful
air
*NL*
which
I
perceived
drew
tears
from
the
eyes
of
his
amiable
companion
,
of
*NL*
which
the
old
man
took
no
notice
,
until
she
sobbed
audibly
;
he
then
*NL*
pronounced
a
few
sounds
,
and
the
fair
creature
,
leaving
her
work
,
knelt
*NL*
at
his
feet
.
He
raised
her
and
smiled
with
such
kindness
and
affection
*NL*
that
I
felt
sensations
of
a
peculiar
and
overpowering
nature
;
they
were
*NL*
a
mixture
of
pain
and
pleasure
,
such
as
I
had
never
before
experienced
,
*NL*
either
from
hunger
or
cold
,
warmth
or
food
;
and
I
withdrew
from
the
*NL*
window
,
unable
to
bear
these
emotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
after
this
the
young
man
returned
,
bearing
on
his
shoulders
a
*NL*
load
of
wood
.
The
girl
met
him
at
the
door
,
helped
to
relieve
him
of
*NL*
his
burden
,
and
taking
some
of
the
fuel
into
the
cottage
,
placed
it
on
*NL*
the
fire
;
then
she
and
the
youth
went
apart
into
a
nook
of
the
cottage
,
*NL*
and
he
showed
her
a
large
loaf
and
a
piece
of
cheese
.
She
seemed
*NL*
pleased
and
went
into
the
garden
for
some
roots
and
plants
,
which
she
*NL*
placed
in
water
,
and
then
upon
the
fire
.
She
afterwards
continued
her
*NL*
work
,
whilst
the
young
man
went
into
the
garden
and
appeared
busily
*NL*
employed
in
digging
and
pulling
up
roots
.
After
he
had
been
employed
*NL*
thus
about
an
hour
,
the
young
woman
joined
him
and
they
entered
the
*NL*
cottage
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
man
had
,
in
the
meantime
,
been
pensive
,
but
on
the
appearance
*NL*
of
his
companions
he
assumed
a
more
cheerful
air
,
and
they
sat
down
to
*NL*
eat
.
The
meal
was
quickly
dispatched
.
The
young
woman
was
again
*NL*
occupied
in
arranging
the
cottage
,
the
old
man
walked
before
the
*NL*
cottage
in
the
sun
for
a
few
minutes
,
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
youth
.
*NL*
Nothing
could
exceed
in
beauty
the
contrast
between
these
two
excellent
*NL*
creatures
.
One
was
old
,
with
silver
hairs
and
a
countenance
beaming
*NL*
with
benevolence
and
love
;
the
younger
was
slight
and
graceful
in
his
*NL*
figure
,
and
his
features
were
moulded
with
the
finest
symmetry
,
yet
his
*NL*
eyes
and
attitude
expressed
the
utmost
sadness
and
despondency
.
The
*NL*
old
man
returned
to
the
cottage
,
and
the
youth
,
with
tools
different
*NL*
from
those
he
had
used
in
the
morning
,
directed
his
steps
across
the
*NL*
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Night
quickly
shut
in
,
but
to
my
extreme
wonder
,
I
found
that
the
*NL*
cottagers
had
a
means
of
prolonging
light
by
the
use
of
tapers
,
and
was
*NL*
delighted
to
find
that
the
setting
of
the
sun
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
*NL*
pleasure
I
experienced
in
watching
my
human
neighbours
.
In
the
evening
*NL*
the
young
girl
and
her
companion
were
employed
in
various
occupations
*NL*
which
I
did
not
understand
;
and
the
old
man
again
took
up
the
*NL*
instrument
which
produced
the
divine
sounds
that
had
enchanted
me
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
So
soon
as
he
had
finished
,
the
youth
began
,
not
to
play
,
*NL*
but
to
utter
sounds
that
were
monotonous
,
and
neither
resembling
the
*NL*
harmony
of
the
old
man
's
instrument
nor
the
songs
of
the
birds
;
I
since
*NL*
found
that
he
read
aloud
,
but
at
that
time
I
knew
nothing
of
the
*NL*
science
of
words
or
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
family
,
after
having
been
thus
occupied
for
a
short
time
,
*NL*
extinguished
their
lights
and
retired
,
as
I
conjectured
,
to
rest
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lay
on
my
straw
,
but
I
could
not
sleep
.
I
thought
of
the
*NL*
occurrences
of
the
day
.
What
chiefly
struck
me
was
the
gentle
manners
*NL*
of
these
people
,
and
I
longed
to
join
them
,
but
dared
not
.
I
*NL*
remembered
too
well
the
treatment
I
had
suffered
the
night
before
from
*NL*
the
barbarous
villagers
,
and
resolved
,
whatever
course
of
conduct
I
*NL*
might
hereafter
think
it
right
to
pursue
,
that
for
the
present
I
would
*NL*
remain
quietly
in
my
hovel
,
watching
and
endeavouring
to
discover
the
*NL*
motives
which
influenced
their
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cottagers
arose
the
next
morning
before
the
sun
.
The
young
woman
*NL*
arranged
the
cottage
and
prepared
the
food
,
and
the
youth
departed
*NL*
after
the
first
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
day
was
passed
in
the
same
routine
as
that
which
preceded
it
.
*NL*
The
young
man
was
constantly
employed
out
of
doors
,
and
the
girl
in
*NL*
various
laborious
occupations
within
.
The
old
man
,
whom
I
soon
*NL*
perceived
to
be
blind
,
employed
his
leisure
hours
on
his
instrument
or
*NL*
in
contemplation
.
Nothing
could
exceed
the
love
and
respect
which
the
*NL*
younger
cottagers
exhibited
towards
their
venerable
companion
.
They
*NL*
performed
towards
him
every
little
office
of
affection
and
duty
with
*NL*
gentleness
,
and
he
rewarded
them
by
his
benevolent
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
not
entirely
happy
.
The
young
man
and
his
companion
often
*NL*
went
apart
and
appeared
to
weep
.
I
saw
no
cause
for
their
unhappiness
,
*NL*
but
I
was
deeply
affected
by
it
.
If
such
lovely
creatures
were
*NL*
miserable
,
it
was
less
strange
that
I
,
an
imperfect
and
solitary
being
,
*NL*
should
be
wretched
.
Yet
why
were
these
gentle
beings
unhappy
?
They
*NL*
possessed
a
delightful
house
-LRB-
for
such
it
was
in
my
eyes
-RRB-
and
every
*NL*
luxury
;
they
had
a
fire
to
warm
them
when
chill
and
delicious
viands
*NL*
when
hungry
;
they
were
dressed
in
excellent
clothes
;
and
,
still
more
,
*NL*
they
enjoyed
one
another
's
company
and
speech
,
interchanging
each
day
*NL*
looks
of
affection
and
kindness
.
What
did
their
tears
imply
?
Did
they
*NL*
really
express
pain
?
I
was
at
first
unable
to
solve
these
questions
,
*NL*
but
perpetual
attention
and
time
explained
to
me
many
appearances
which
*NL*
were
at
first
enigmatic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
considerable
period
elapsed
before
I
discovered
one
of
the
causes
of
*NL*
the
uneasiness
of
this
amiable
family
:
it
was
poverty
,
and
they
*NL*
suffered
that
evil
in
a
very
distressing
degree
.
Their
nourishment
*NL*
consisted
entirely
of
the
vegetables
of
their
garden
and
the
milk
of
*NL*
one
cow
,
which
gave
very
little
during
the
winter
,
when
its
masters
*NL*
could
scarcely
procure
food
to
support
it
.
They
often
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
suffered
the
pangs
of
hunger
very
poignantly
,
especially
the
two
*NL*
younger
cottagers
,
for
several
times
they
placed
food
before
the
old
*NL*
man
when
they
reserved
none
for
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
trait
of
kindness
moved
me
sensibly
.
I
had
been
accustomed
,
*NL*
during
the
night
,
to
steal
a
part
of
their
store
for
my
own
*NL*
consumption
,
but
when
I
found
that
in
doing
this
I
inflicted
pain
on
*NL*
the
cottagers
,
I
abstained
and
satisfied
myself
with
berries
,
nuts
,
and
*NL*
roots
which
I
gathered
from
a
neighbouring
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
discovered
also
another
means
through
which
I
was
enabled
to
assist
*NL*
their
labours
.
I
found
that
the
youth
spent
a
great
part
of
each
day
*NL*
in
collecting
wood
for
the
family
fire
,
and
during
the
night
I
often
*NL*
took
his
tools
,
the
use
of
which
I
quickly
discovered
,
and
brought
home
*NL*
firing
sufficient
for
the
consumption
of
several
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
the
first
time
that
I
did
this
,
the
young
woman
,
when
she
*NL*
opened
the
door
in
the
morning
,
appeared
greatly
astonished
on
seeing
a
*NL*
great
pile
of
wood
on
the
outside
.
She
uttered
some
words
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
,
and
the
youth
joined
her
,
who
also
expressed
surprise
.
I
*NL*
observed
,
with
pleasure
,
that
he
did
not
go
to
the
forest
that
day
,
but
*NL*
spent
it
in
repairing
the
cottage
and
cultivating
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
degrees
I
made
a
discovery
of
still
greater
moment
.
I
found
that
*NL*
these
people
possessed
a
method
of
communicating
their
experience
and
*NL*
feelings
to
one
another
by
articulate
sounds
.
I
perceived
that
the
*NL*
words
they
spoke
sometimes
produced
pleasure
or
pain
,
smiles
or
*NL*
sadness
,
in
the
minds
and
countenances
of
the
hearers
.
This
was
indeed
*NL*
a
godlike
science
,
and
I
ardently
desired
to
become
acquainted
with
it
.
*NL*
But
I
was
baffled
in
every
attempt
I
made
for
this
purpose
.
Their
*NL*
pronunciation
was
quick
,
and
the
words
they
uttered
,
not
having
any
*NL*
apparent
connection
with
visible
objects
,
I
was
unable
to
discover
any
*NL*
clue
by
which
I
could
unravel
the
mystery
of
their
reference
.
By
great
*NL*
application
,
however
,
and
after
having
remained
during
the
space
of
*NL*
several
revolutions
of
the
moon
in
my
hovel
,
I
discovered
the
names
*NL*
that
were
given
to
some
of
the
most
familiar
objects
of
discourse
;
I
*NL*
learned
and
applied
the
words
,
`
fire
,
'
`
milk
,
'
`
bread
,
'
and
`
wood
.
'
I
*NL*
learned
also
the
names
of
the
cottagers
themselves
.
The
youth
and
his
*NL*
companion
had
each
of
them
several
names
,
but
the
old
man
had
only
one
,
*NL*
which
was
`
father
.
'
The
girl
was
called
`
sister
'
or
`
Agatha
,
'
and
the
*NL*
youth
`
Felix
,
'
`
brother
,
'
or
`
son
.
'
I
can
not
describe
the
delight
I
*NL*
felt
when
I
learned
the
ideas
appropriated
to
each
of
these
sounds
and
*NL*
was
able
to
pronounce
them
.
I
distinguished
several
other
words
*NL*
without
being
able
as
yet
to
understand
or
apply
them
,
such
as
`
good
,
'
*NL*
`
dearest
,
'
`
unhappy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
spent
the
winter
in
this
manner
.
The
gentle
manners
and
beauty
of
*NL*
the
cottagers
greatly
endeared
them
to
me
;
when
they
were
unhappy
,
I
*NL*
felt
depressed
;
when
they
rejoiced
,
I
sympathized
in
their
joys
.
I
saw
*NL*
few
human
beings
besides
them
,
and
if
any
other
happened
to
enter
the
*NL*
cottage
,
their
harsh
manners
and
rude
gait
only
enhanced
to
me
the
*NL*
superior
accomplishments
of
my
friends
.
The
old
man
,
I
could
perceive
,
*NL*
often
endeavoured
to
encourage
his
children
,
as
sometimes
I
found
that
*NL*
he
called
them
,
to
cast
off
their
melancholy
.
He
would
talk
in
a
*NL*
cheerful
accent
,
with
an
expression
of
goodness
that
bestowed
pleasure
*NL*
even
upon
me
.
Agatha
listened
with
respect
,
her
eyes
sometimes
filled
*NL*
with
tears
,
which
she
endeavoured
to
wipe
away
unperceived
;
but
I
*NL*
generally
found
that
her
countenance
and
tone
were
more
cheerful
after
*NL*
having
listened
to
the
exhortations
of
her
father
.
It
was
not
thus
*NL*
with
Felix
.
He
was
always
the
saddest
of
the
group
,
and
even
to
my
*NL*
unpractised
senses
,
he
appeared
to
have
suffered
more
deeply
than
his
*NL*
friends
.
But
if
his
countenance
was
more
sorrowful
,
his
voice
was
more
*NL*
cheerful
than
that
of
his
sister
,
especially
when
he
addressed
the
old
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
mention
innumerable
instances
which
,
although
slight
,
marked
*NL*
the
dispositions
of
these
amiable
cottagers
.
In
the
midst
of
poverty
*NL*
and
want
,
Felix
carried
with
pleasure
to
his
sister
the
first
little
*NL*
white
flower
that
peeped
out
from
beneath
the
snowy
ground
.
Early
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
before
she
had
risen
,
he
cleared
away
the
snow
that
*NL*
obstructed
her
path
to
the
milk-house
,
drew
water
from
the
well
,
and
*NL*
brought
the
wood
from
the
outhouse
,
where
,
to
his
perpetual
*NL*
astonishment
,
he
found
his
store
always
replenished
by
an
invisible
*NL*
hand
.
In
the
day
,
I
believe
,
he
worked
sometimes
for
a
neighbouring
*NL*
farmer
,
because
he
often
went
forth
and
did
not
return
until
dinner
,
*NL*
yet
brought
no
wood
with
him
.
At
other
times
he
worked
in
the
garden
,
*NL*
but
as
there
was
little
to
do
in
the
frosty
season
,
he
read
to
the
old
*NL*
man
and
Agatha

*NL*
``
This
reading
had
puzzled
me
extremely
at
first
,
but
by
degrees
I
*NL*
discovered
that
he
uttered
many
of
the
same
sounds
when
he
read
as
when
*NL*
he
talked
.
I
conjectured
,
therefore
,
that
he
found
on
the
paper
signs
*NL*
for
speech
which
he
understood
,
and
I
ardently
longed
to
comprehend
*NL*
these
also
;
but
how
was
that
possible
when
I
did
not
even
understand
*NL*
the
sounds
for
which
they
stood
as
signs
?
I
improved
,
however
,
*NL*
sensibly
in
this
science
,
but
not
sufficiently
to
follow
up
any
kind
of
*NL*
conversation
,
although
I
applied
my
whole
mind
to
the
endeavour
,
for
I
*NL*
easily
perceived
that
,
although
I
eagerly
longed
to
discover
myself
to
*NL*
the
cottagers
,
I
ought
not
to
make
the
attempt
until
I
had
first
become
*NL*
master
of
their
language
,
which
knowledge
might
enable
me
to
make
them
*NL*
overlook
the
deformity
of
my
figure
,
for
with
this
also
the
contrast
*NL*
perpetually
presented
to
my
eyes
had
made
me
acquainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
admired
the
perfect
forms
of
my
cottagers
--
their
grace
,
beauty
,
*NL*
and
delicate
complexions
;
but
how
was
I
terrified
when
I
viewed
myself
*NL*
in
a
transparent
pool
!
At
first
I
started
back
,
unable
to
believe
that
*NL*
it
was
indeed
I
who
was
reflected
in
the
mirror
;
and
when
I
became
*NL*
fully
convinced
that
I
was
in
reality
the
monster
that
I
am
,
I
was
*NL*
filled
with
the
bitterest
sensations
of
despondence
and
mortification
.
*NL*
Alas
!
I
did
not
yet
entirely
know
the
fatal
effects
of
this
miserable
*NL*
deformity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the
sun
became
warmer
and
the
light
of
day
longer
,
the
snow
*NL*
vanished
,
and
I
beheld
the
bare
trees
and
the
black
earth
.
From
this
*NL*
time
Felix
was
more
employed
,
and
the
heart-moving
indications
of
*NL*
impending
famine
disappeared
.
Their
food
,
as
I
afterwards
found
,
was
*NL*
coarse
,
but
it
was
wholesome
;
and
they
procured
a
sufficiency
of
it
.
*NL*
Several
new
kinds
of
plants
sprang
up
in
the
garden
,
which
they
*NL*
dressed
;
and
these
signs
of
comfort
increased
daily
as
the
season
*NL*
advanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
man
,
leaning
on
his
son
,
walked
each
day
at
noon
,
when
it
did
*NL*
not
rain
,
as
I
found
it
was
called
when
the
heavens
poured
forth
its
*NL*
waters
.
This
frequently
took
place
,
but
a
high
wind
quickly
dried
the
*NL*
earth
,
and
the
season
became
far
more
pleasant
than
it
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mode
of
life
in
my
hovel
was
uniform
.
During
the
morning
I
*NL*
attended
the
motions
of
the
cottagers
,
and
when
they
were
dispersed
in
*NL*
various
occupations
,
I
slept
;
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
spent
in
*NL*
observing
my
friends
.
When
they
had
retired
to
rest
,
if
there
was
any
*NL*
moon
or
the
night
was
star-light
,
I
went
into
the
woods
and
collected
*NL*
my
own
food
and
fuel
for
the
cottage
.
When
I
returned
,
as
often
as
it
*NL*
was
necessary
,
I
cleared
their
path
from
the
snow
and
performed
those
*NL*
offices
that
I
had
seen
done
by
Felix
.
I
afterwards
found
that
these
*NL*
labours
,
performed
by
an
invisible
hand
,
greatly
astonished
them
;
and
*NL*
once
or
twice
I
heard
them
,
on
these
occasions
,
utter
the
words
`
good
*NL*
spirit
,
'
`
wonderful
'
;
but
I
did
not
then
understand
the
signification
*NL*
of
these
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
thoughts
now
became
more
active
,
and
I
longed
to
discover
the
*NL*
motives
and
feelings
of
these
lovely
creatures
;
I
was
inquisitive
to
*NL*
know
why
Felix
appeared
so
miserable
and
Agatha
so
sad
.
I
thought
*NL*
-LRB-
foolish
wretch
!
-RRB-
that
it
might
be
in
my
power
to
restore
happiness
to
*NL*
these
deserving
people
.
When
I
slept
or
was
absent
,
the
forms
of
the
*NL*
venerable
blind
father
,
the
gentle
Agatha
,
and
the
excellent
Felix
*NL*
flitted
before
me
.
I
looked
upon
them
as
superior
beings
who
would
be
*NL*
the
arbiters
of
my
future
destiny
.
I
formed
in
my
imagination
a
*NL*
thousand
pictures
of
presenting
myself
to
them
,
and
their
reception
of
*NL*
me
.
I
imagined
that
they
would
be
disgusted
,
until
,
by
my
gentle
*NL*
demeanour
and
conciliating
words
,
I
should
first
win
their
favour
and
*NL*
afterwards
their
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
thoughts
exhilarated
me
and
led
me
to
apply
with
fresh
ardour
to
*NL*
the
acquiring
the
art
of
language
.
My
organs
were
indeed
harsh
,
but
*NL*
supple
;
and
although
my
voice
was
very
unlike
the
soft
music
of
their
*NL*
tones
,
yet
I
pronounced
such
words
as
I
understood
with
tolerable
ease
.
*NL*
It
was
as
the
ass
and
the
lap-dog
;
yet
surely
the
gentle
ass
whose
*NL*
intentions
were
affectionate
,
although
his
manners
were
rude
,
deserved
*NL*
better
treatment
than
blows
and
execration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pleasant
showers
and
genial
warmth
of
spring
greatly
altered
the
*NL*
aspect
of
the
earth
.
Men
who
before
this
change
seemed
to
have
been
*NL*
hid
in
caves
dispersed
themselves
and
were
employed
in
various
arts
of
*NL*
cultivation
.
The
birds
sang
in
more
cheerful
notes
,
and
the
leaves
*NL*
began
to
bud
forth
on
the
trees
.
Happy
,
happy
earth
!
Fit
habitation
*NL*
for
gods
,
which
,
so
short
a
time
before
,
was
bleak
,
damp
,
and
*NL*
unwholesome
.
My
spirits
were
elevated
by
the
enchanting
appearance
of
*NL*
nature
;
the
past
was
blotted
from
my
memory
,
the
present
was
tranquil
,
*NL*
and
the
future
gilded
by
bright
rays
of
hope
and
anticipations
of
joy

``
I
now
hasten
to
the
more
moving
part
of
my
story
.
I
shall
relate
*NL*
events
that
impressed
me
with
feelings
which
,
from
what
I
had
been
,
*NL*
have
made
me
what
I
am

*NL*
*NL*
``
Spring
advanced
rapidly
;
the
weather
became
fine
and
the
skies
*NL*
cloudless
.
It
surprised
me
that
what
before
was
desert
and
gloomy
*NL*
should
now
bloom
with
the
most
beautiful
flowers
and
verdure
.
My
*NL*
senses
were
gratified
and
refreshed
by
a
thousand
scents
of
delight
and
*NL*
a
thousand
sights
of
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
on
one
of
these
days
,
when
my
cottagers
periodically
rested
*NL*
from
labour
--
the
old
man
played
on
his
guitar
,
and
the
children
*NL*
listened
to
him
--
that
I
observed
the
countenance
of
Felix
was
*NL*
melancholy
beyond
expression
;
he
sighed
frequently
,
and
once
his
father
*NL*
paused
in
his
music
,
and
I
conjectured
by
his
manner
that
he
inquired
*NL*
the
cause
of
his
son
's
sorrow
.
Felix
replied
in
a
cheerful
accent
,
and
*NL*
the
old
man
was
recommencing
his
music
when
someone
tapped
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
lady
on
horseback
,
accompanied
by
a
country-man
as
a
guide
.
*NL*
The
lady
was
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
and
covered
with
a
thick
black
*NL*
veil
.
Agatha
asked
a
question
,
to
which
the
stranger
only
replied
by
*NL*
pronouncing
,
in
a
sweet
accent
,
the
name
of
Felix
.
Her
voice
was
*NL*
musical
but
unlike
that
of
either
of
my
friends
.
On
hearing
this
word
,
*NL*
Felix
came
up
hastily
to
the
lady
,
who
,
when
she
saw
him
,
threw
up
her
*NL*
veil
,
and
I
beheld
a
countenance
of
angelic
beauty
and
expression
.
Her
*NL*
hair
of
a
shining
raven
black
,
and
curiously
braided
;
her
eyes
were
*NL*
dark
,
but
gentle
,
although
animated
;
her
features
of
a
regular
*NL*
proportion
,
and
her
complexion
wondrously
fair
,
each
cheek
tinged
with
*NL*
a
lovely
pink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felix
seemed
ravished
with
delight
when
he
saw
her
,
every
trait
of
*NL*
sorrow
vanished
from
his
face
,
and
it
instantly
expressed
a
degree
of
*NL*
ecstatic
joy
,
of
which
I
could
hardly
have
believed
it
capable
;
his
*NL*
eyes
sparkled
,
as
his
cheek
flushed
with
pleasure
;
and
at
that
moment
I
*NL*
thought
him
as
beautiful
as
the
stranger
.
She
appeared
affected
by
*NL*
different
feelings
;
wiping
a
few
tears
from
her
lovely
eyes
,
she
held
*NL*
out
her
hand
to
Felix
,
who
kissed
it
rapturously
and
called
her
,
as
*NL*
well
as
I
could
distinguish
,
his
sweet
Arabian
.
She
did
not
appear
to
*NL*
understand
him
,
but
smiled
.
He
assisted
her
to
dismount
,
and
*NL*
dismissing
her
guide
,
conducted
her
into
the
cottage
.
Some
*NL*
conversation
took
place
between
him
and
his
father
,
and
the
young
*NL*
stranger
knelt
at
the
old
man
's
feet
and
would
have
kissed
his
hand
,
*NL*
but
he
raised
her
and
embraced
her
affectionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
soon
perceived
that
although
the
stranger
uttered
articulate
sounds
*NL*
and
appeared
to
have
a
language
of
her
own
,
she
was
neither
understood
*NL*
by
nor
herself
understood
the
cottagers
.
They
made
many
signs
which
I
*NL*
did
not
comprehend
,
but
I
saw
that
her
presence
diffused
gladness
*NL*
through
the
cottage
,
dispelling
their
sorrow
as
the
sun
dissipates
the
*NL*
morning
mists
.
Felix
seemed
peculiarly
happy
and
with
smiles
of
*NL*
delight
welcomed
his
Arabian
.
Agatha
,
the
ever-gentle
Agatha
,
kissed
*NL*
the
hands
of
the
lovely
stranger
,
and
pointing
to
her
brother
,
made
*NL*
signs
which
appeared
to
me
to
mean
that
he
had
been
sorrowful
until
she
*NL*
came
.
Some
hours
passed
thus
,
while
they
,
by
their
countenances
,
*NL*
expressed
joy
,
the
cause
of
which
I
did
not
comprehend
.
Presently
I
*NL*
found
,
by
the
frequent
recurrence
of
some
sound
which
the
stranger
*NL*
repeated
after
them
,
that
she
was
endeavouring
to
learn
their
language
;
*NL*
and
the
idea
instantly
occurred
to
me
that
I
should
make
use
of
the
*NL*
same
instructions
to
the
same
end
.
The
stranger
learned
about
twenty
*NL*
words
at
the
first
lesson
;
most
of
them
,
indeed
,
were
those
which
I
had
*NL*
before
understood
,
but
I
profited
by
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
night
came
on
,
Agatha
and
the
Arabian
retired
early
.
When
they
*NL*
separated
Felix
kissed
the
hand
of
the
stranger
and
said
,
`
Good
night
*NL*
sweet
Safie
.
'
He
sat
up
much
longer
,
conversing
with
his
father
,
and
*NL*
by
the
frequent
repetition
of
her
name
I
conjectured
that
their
lovely
*NL*
guest
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
.
I
ardently
desired
to
*NL*
understand
them
,
and
bent
every
faculty
towards
that
purpose
,
but
found
*NL*
it
utterly
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
morning
Felix
went
out
to
his
work
,
and
after
the
usual
*NL*
occupations
of
Agatha
were
finished
,
the
Arabian
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
*NL*
old
man
,
and
taking
his
guitar
,
played
some
airs
so
entrancingly
*NL*
beautiful
that
they
at
once
drew
tears
of
sorrow
and
delight
from
my
*NL*
eyes
.
She
sang
,
and
her
voice
flowed
in
a
rich
cadence
,
swelling
or
*NL*
dying
away
like
a
nightingale
of
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
she
had
finished
,
she
gave
the
guitar
to
Agatha
,
who
at
first
*NL*
declined
it
.
She
played
a
simple
air
,
and
her
voice
accompanied
it
in
*NL*
sweet
accents
,
but
unlike
the
wondrous
strain
of
the
stranger
.
The
old
*NL*
man
appeared
enraptured
and
said
some
words
which
Agatha
endeavoured
to
*NL*
explain
to
Safie
,
and
by
which
he
appeared
to
wish
to
express
that
she
*NL*
bestowed
on
him
the
greatest
delight
by
her
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
days
now
passed
as
peaceably
as
before
,
with
the
sole
alteration
*NL*
that
joy
had
taken
place
of
sadness
in
the
countenances
of
my
friends
.
*NL*
Safie
was
always
gay
and
happy
;
she
and
I
improved
rapidly
in
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
language
,
so
that
in
two
months
I
began
to
comprehend
most
*NL*
of
the
words
uttered
by
my
protectors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
meanwhile
also
the
black
ground
was
covered
with
herbage
,
and
*NL*
the
green
banks
interspersed
with
innumerable
flowers
,
sweet
to
the
*NL*
scent
and
the
eyes
,
stars
of
pale
radiance
among
the
moonlight
woods
;
*NL*
the
sun
became
warmer
,
the
nights
clear
and
balmy
;
and
my
nocturnal
*NL*
rambles
were
an
extreme
pleasure
to
me
,
although
they
were
considerably
*NL*
shortened
by
the
late
setting
and
early
rising
of
the
sun
,
for
I
never
*NL*
ventured
abroad
during
daylight
,
fearful
of
meeting
with
the
same
*NL*
treatment
I
had
formerly
endured
in
the
first
village
which
I
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
days
were
spent
in
close
attention
,
that
I
might
more
speedily
*NL*
master
the
language
;
and
I
may
boast
that
I
improved
more
rapidly
than
*NL*
the
Arabian
,
who
understood
very
little
and
conversed
in
broken
*NL*
accents
,
whilst
I
comprehended
and
could
imitate
almost
every
word
that
*NL*
was
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
I
improved
in
speech
,
I
also
learned
the
science
of
letters
as
*NL*
it
was
taught
to
the
stranger
,
and
this
opened
before
me
a
wide
field
*NL*
for
wonder
and
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
book
from
which
Felix
instructed
Safie
was
Volney
's
Ruins
of
*NL*
Empires
.
I
should
not
have
understood
the
purport
of
this
book
had
not
*NL*
Felix
,
in
reading
it
,
given
very
minute
explanations
.
He
had
chosen
*NL*
this
work
,
he
said
,
because
the
declamatory
style
was
framed
in
*NL*
imitation
of
the
Eastern
authors
.
Through
this
work
I
obtained
a
*NL*
cursory
knowledge
of
history
and
a
view
of
the
several
empires
at
*NL*
present
existing
in
the
world
;
it
gave
me
an
insight
into
the
manners
,
*NL*
governments
,
and
religions
of
the
different
nations
of
the
earth
.
I
*NL*
heard
of
the
slothful
Asiatics
,
of
the
stupendous
genius
and
mental
*NL*
activity
of
the
Grecians
,
of
the
wars
and
wonderful
virtue
of
the
early
*NL*
Romans
--
of
their
subsequent
degenerating
--
of
the
decline
of
that
mighty
*NL*
empire
,
of
chivalry
,
Christianity
,
and
kings
.
I
heard
of
the
discovery
*NL*
of
the
American
hemisphere
and
wept
with
Safie
over
the
hapless
fate
of
*NL*
its
original
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
wonderful
narrations
inspired
me
with
strange
feelings
.
Was
*NL*
man
,
indeed
,
at
once
so
powerful
,
so
virtuous
and
magnificent
,
yet
so
*NL*
vicious
and
base
?
He
appeared
at
one
time
a
mere
scion
of
the
evil
*NL*
principle
and
at
another
as
all
that
can
be
conceived
of
noble
and
*NL*
godlike
.
To
be
a
great
and
virtuous
man
appeared
the
highest
honour
*NL*
that
can
befall
a
sensitive
being
;
to
be
base
and
vicious
,
as
many
on
*NL*
record
have
been
,
appeared
the
lowest
degradation
,
a
condition
more
*NL*
abject
than
that
of
the
blind
mole
or
harmless
worm
.
For
a
long
time
I
*NL*
could
not
conceive
how
one
man
could
go
forth
to
murder
his
fellow
,
or
*NL*
even
why
there
were
laws
and
governments
;
but
when
I
heard
details
of
*NL*
vice
and
bloodshed
,
my
wonder
ceased
and
I
turned
away
with
disgust
and
*NL*
loathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
conversation
of
the
cottagers
now
opened
new
wonders
to
me
.
*NL*
While
I
listened
to
the
instructions
which
Felix
bestowed
upon
the
*NL*
Arabian
,
the
strange
system
of
human
society
was
explained
to
me
.
I
*NL*
heard
of
the
division
of
property
,
of
immense
wealth
and
squalid
*NL*
poverty
,
of
rank
,
descent
,
and
noble
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
words
induced
me
to
turn
towards
myself
.
I
learned
that
the
*NL*
possessions
most
esteemed
by
your
fellow
creatures
were
high
and
*NL*
unsullied
descent
united
with
riches
.
A
man
might
be
respected
with
*NL*
only
one
of
these
advantages
,
but
without
either
he
was
considered
,
*NL*
except
in
very
rare
instances
,
as
a
vagabond
and
a
slave
,
doomed
to
*NL*
waste
his
powers
for
the
profits
of
the
chosen
few
!
And
what
was
I
?
Of
*NL*
my
creation
and
creator
I
was
absolutely
ignorant
,
but
I
knew
that
I
*NL*
possessed
no
money
,
no
friends
,
no
kind
of
property
.
I
was
,
besides
,
*NL*
endued
with
a
figure
hideously
deformed
and
loathsome
;
I
was
not
even
*NL*
of
the
same
nature
as
man
.
I
was
more
agile
than
they
and
could
*NL*
subsist
upon
coarser
diet
;
I
bore
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
with
*NL*
less
injury
to
my
frame
;
my
stature
far
exceeded
theirs
.
When
I
looked
*NL*
around
I
saw
and
heard
of
none
like
me
.
Was
I
,
then
,
a
monster
,
a
blot
*NL*
upon
the
earth
,
from
which
all
men
fled
and
whom
all
men
disowned
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
describe
to
you
the
agony
that
these
reflections
inflicted
*NL*
upon
me
;
I
tried
to
dispel
them
,
but
sorrow
only
increased
with
*NL*
knowledge
.
Oh
,
that
I
had
forever
remained
in
my
native
wood
,
nor
*NL*
known
nor
felt
beyond
the
sensations
of
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
heat
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
a
strange
nature
is
knowledge
!
It
clings
to
the
mind
when
it
*NL*
has
once
seized
on
it
like
a
lichen
on
the
rock
.
I
wished
sometimes
to
*NL*
shake
off
all
thought
and
feeling
,
but
I
learned
that
there
was
but
one
*NL*
means
to
overcome
the
sensation
of
pain
,
and
that
was
death
--
a
state
*NL*
which
I
feared
yet
did
not
understand
.
I
admired
virtue
and
good
*NL*
feelings
and
loved
the
gentle
manners
and
amiable
qualities
of
my
*NL*
cottagers
,
but
I
was
shut
out
from
intercourse
with
them
,
except
*NL*
through
means
which
I
obtained
by
stealth
,
when
I
was
unseen
and
*NL*
unknown
,
and
which
rather
increased
than
satisfied
the
desire
I
had
of
*NL*
becoming
one
among
my
fellows
.
The
gentle
words
of
Agatha
and
the
*NL*
animated
smiles
of
the
charming
Arabian
were
not
for
me
.
The
mild
*NL*
exhortations
of
the
old
man
and
the
lively
conversation
of
the
loved
*NL*
Felix
were
not
for
me
.
Miserable
,
unhappy
wretch
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other
lessons
were
impressed
upon
me
even
more
deeply
.
I
heard
of
the
*NL*
difference
of
sexes
,
and
the
birth
and
growth
of
children
,
how
the
*NL*
father
doted
on
the
smiles
of
the
infant
,
and
the
lively
sallies
of
the
*NL*
older
child
,
how
all
the
life
and
cares
of
the
mother
were
wrapped
up
*NL*
in
the
precious
charge
,
how
the
mind
of
youth
expanded
and
gained
*NL*
knowledge
,
of
brother
,
sister
,
and
all
the
various
relationships
which
*NL*
bind
one
human
being
to
another
in
mutual
bonds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
were
my
friends
and
relations
?
No
father
had
watched
my
*NL*
infant
days
,
no
mother
had
blessed
me
with
smiles
and
caresses
;
or
if
*NL*
they
had
,
all
my
past
life
was
now
a
blot
,
a
blind
vacancy
in
which
I
*NL*
distinguished
nothing
.
From
my
earliest
remembrance
I
had
been
as
I
*NL*
then
was
in
height
and
proportion
.
I
had
never
yet
seen
a
being
*NL*
resembling
me
or
who
claimed
any
intercourse
with
me
.
What
was
I
?
The
*NL*
question
again
recurred
,
to
be
answered
only
with
groans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
soon
explain
to
what
these
feelings
tended
,
but
allow
me
now
to
*NL*
return
to
the
cottagers
,
whose
story
excited
in
me
such
various
*NL*
feelings
of
indignation
,
delight
,
and
wonder
,
but
which
all
terminated
*NL*
in
additional
love
and
reverence
for
my
protectors
-LRB-
for
so
I
loved
,
in
*NL*
an
innocent
,
half-painful
self-deceit

to
call
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
time
elapsed
before
I
learned
the
history
of
my
friends
.
It
was
*NL*
one
which
could
not
fail
to
impress
itself
deeply
on
my
mind
,
unfolding
*NL*
as
it
did
a
number
of
circumstances
,
each
interesting
and
wonderful
to
*NL*
one
so
utterly
inexperienced
as
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
of
the
old
man
was
De
Lacey
.
He
was
descended
from
a
good
*NL*
family
in
France
,
where
he
had
lived
for
many
years
in
affluence
,
*NL*
respected
by
his
superiors
and
beloved
by
his
equals
.
His
son
was
bred
*NL*
in
the
service
of
his
country
,
and
Agatha
had
ranked
with
ladies
of
the
*NL*
highest
distinction
.
A
few
months
before
my
arrival
they
had
lived
in
*NL*
a
large
and
luxurious
city
called
Paris
,
surrounded
by
friends
and
*NL*
possessed
of
every
enjoyment
which
virtue
,
refinement
of
intellect
,
or
*NL*
taste
,
accompanied
by
a
moderate
fortune
,
could
afford
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
father
of
Safie
had
been
the
cause
of
their
ruin
.
He
was
a
*NL*
Turkish
merchant
and
had
inhabited
Paris
for
many
years
,
when
,
for
some
*NL*
reason
which
I
could
not
learn
,
he
became
obnoxious
to
the
government
.
*NL*
He
was
seized
and
cast
into
prison
the
very
day
that
Safie
arrived
from
*NL*
Constantinople
to
join
him
.
He
was
tried
and
condemned
to
death
.
The
*NL*
injustice
of
his
sentence
was
very
flagrant
;
all
Paris
was
indignant
;
*NL*
and
it
was
judged
that
his
religion
and
wealth
rather
than
the
crime
*NL*
alleged
against
him
had
been
the
cause
of
his
condemnation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felix
had
accidentally
been
present
at
the
trial
;
his
horror
and
*NL*
indignation
were
uncontrollable
when
he
heard
the
decision
of
the
*NL*
court
.
He
made
,
at
that
moment
,
a
solemn
vow
to
deliver
him
and
then
*NL*
looked
around
for
the
means
.
After
many
fruitless
attempts
to
gain
*NL*
admittance
to
the
prison
,
he
found
a
strongly
grated
window
in
an
*NL*
unguarded
part
of
the
building
,
which
lighted
the
dungeon
of
the
*NL*
unfortunate
Muhammadan
,
who
,
loaded
with
chains
,
waited
in
despair
the
*NL*
execution
of
the
barbarous
sentence
.
Felix
visited
the
grate
at
night
*NL*
and
made
known
to
the
prisoner
his
intentions
in
his
favour
.
The
Turk
,
*NL*
amazed
and
delighted
,
endeavoured
to
kindle
the
zeal
of
his
deliverer
*NL*
by
promises
of
reward
and
wealth
.
Felix
rejected
his
offers
with
*NL*
contempt
,
yet
when
he
saw
the
lovely
Safie
,
who
was
allowed
to
visit
*NL*
her
father
and
who
by
her
gestures
expressed
her
lively
gratitude
,
the
*NL*
youth
could
not
help
owning
to
his
own
mind
that
the
captive
possessed
*NL*
a
treasure
which
would
fully
reward
his
toil
and
hazard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Turk
quickly
perceived
the
impression
that
his
daughter
had
made
*NL*
on
the
heart
of
Felix
and
endeavoured
to
secure
him
more
entirely
in
*NL*
his
interests
by
the
promise
of
her
hand
in
marriage
so
soon
as
he
*NL*
should
be
conveyed
to
a
place
of
safety
.
Felix
was
too
delicate
to
*NL*
accept
this
offer
,
yet
he
looked
forward
to
the
probability
of
the
*NL*
event
as
to
the
consummation
of
his
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
During
the
ensuing
days
,
while
the
preparations
were
going
forward
for
*NL*
the
escape
of
the
merchant
,
the
zeal
of
Felix
was
warmed
by
several
*NL*
letters
that
he
received
from
this
lovely
girl
,
who
found
means
to
*NL*
express
her
thoughts
in
the
language
of
her
lover
by
the
aid
of
an
old
*NL*
man
,
a
servant
of
her
father
who
understood
French
.
She
thanked
him
in
*NL*
the
most
ardent
terms
for
his
intended
services
towards
her
parent
,
and
*NL*
at
the
same
time
she
gently
deplored
her
own
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
copies
of
these
letters
,
for
I
found
means
,
during
my
residence
*NL*
in
the
hovel
,
to
procure
the
implements
of
writing
;
and
the
letters
*NL*
were
often
in
the
hands
of
Felix
or
Agatha
.
Before
I
depart
I
will
*NL*
give
them
to
you
;
they
will
prove
the
truth
of
my
tale
;
but
at
present
,
*NL*
as
the
sun
is
already
far
declined
,
I
shall
only
have
time
to
repeat
*NL*
the
substance
of
them
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safie
related
that
her
mother
was
a
Christian
Arab
,
seized
and
made
a
*NL*
slave
by
the
Turks
;
recommended
by
her
beauty
,
she
had
won
the
heart
of
*NL*
the
father
of
Safie
,
who
married
her
.
The
young
girl
spoke
in
high
and
*NL*
enthusiastic
terms
of
her
mother
,
who
,
born
in
freedom
,
spurned
the
*NL*
bondage
to
which
she
was
now
reduced
.
She
instructed
her
daughter
in
*NL*
the
tenets
of
her
religion
and
taught
her
to
aspire
to
higher
powers
of
*NL*
intellect
and
an
independence
of
spirit
forbidden
to
the
female
*NL*
followers
of
Muhammad
.
This
lady
died
,
but
her
lessons
were
indelibly
*NL*
impressed
on
the
mind
of
Safie
,
who
sickened
at
the
prospect
of
again
*NL*
returning
to
Asia
and
being
immured
within
the
walls
of
a
harem
,
*NL*
allowed
only
to
occupy
herself
with
infantile
amusements
,
ill-suited
to
*NL*
the
temper
of
her
soul
,
now
accustomed
to
grand
ideas
and
a
noble
*NL*
emulation
for
virtue
.
The
prospect
of
marrying
a
Christian
and
*NL*
remaining
in
a
country
where
women
were
allowed
to
take
a
rank
in
*NL*
society
was
enchanting
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
for
the
execution
of
the
Turk
was
fixed
,
but
on
the
night
*NL*
previous
to
it
he
quitted
his
prison
and
before
morning
was
distant
*NL*
many
leagues
from
Paris
.
Felix
had
procured
passports
in
the
name
of
*NL*
his
father
,
sister
,
and
himself
.
He
had
previously
communicated
his
*NL*
plan
to
the
former
,
who
aided
the
deceit
by
quitting
his
house
,
under
*NL*
the
pretence
of
a
journey
and
concealed
himself
,
with
his
daughter
,
in
*NL*
an
obscure
part
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felix
conducted
the
fugitives
through
France
to
Lyons
and
across
Mont
*NL*
Cenis
to
Leghorn
,
where
the
merchant
had
decided
to
wait
a
favourable
*NL*
opportunity
of
passing
into
some
part
of
the
Turkish
dominions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safie
resolved
to
remain
with
her
father
until
the
moment
of
his
*NL*
departure
,
before
which
time
the
Turk
renewed
his
promise
that
she
*NL*
should
be
united
to
his
deliverer
;
and
Felix
remained
with
them
in
*NL*
expectation
of
that
event
;
and
in
the
meantime
he
enjoyed
the
society
*NL*
of
the
Arabian
,
who
exhibited
towards
him
the
simplest
and
tenderest
*NL*
affection
.
They
conversed
with
one
another
through
the
means
of
an
*NL*
interpreter
,
and
sometimes
with
the
interpretation
of
looks
;
and
Safie
*NL*
sang
to
him
the
divine
airs
of
her
native
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Turk
allowed
this
intimacy
to
take
place
and
encouraged
the
hopes
*NL*
of
the
youthful
lovers
,
while
in
his
heart
he
had
formed
far
other
*NL*
plans
.
He
loathed
the
idea
that
his
daughter
should
be
united
to
a
*NL*
Christian
,
but
he
feared
the
resentment
of
Felix
if
he
should
appear
*NL*
lukewarm
,
for
he
knew
that
he
was
still
in
the
power
of
his
deliverer
*NL*
if
he
should
choose
to
betray
him
to
the
Italian
state
which
they
*NL*
inhabited
.
He
revolved
a
thousand
plans
by
which
he
should
be
enabled
*NL*
to
prolong
the
deceit
until
it
might
be
no
longer
necessary
,
and
*NL*
secretly
to
take
his
daughter
with
him
when
he
departed
.
His
plans
*NL*
were
facilitated
by
the
news
which
arrived
from
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
government
of
France
were
greatly
enraged
at
the
escape
of
their
*NL*
victim
and
spared
no
pains
to
detect
and
punish
his
deliverer
.
The
*NL*
plot
of
Felix
was
quickly
discovered
,
and
De
Lacey
and
Agatha
were
*NL*
thrown
into
prison
.
The
news
reached
Felix
and
roused
him
from
his
*NL*
dream
of
pleasure
.
His
blind
and
aged
father
and
his
gentle
sister
lay
*NL*
in
a
noisome
dungeon
while
he
enjoyed
the
free
air
and
the
society
of
*NL*
her
whom
he
loved
.
This
idea
was
torture
to
him
.
He
quickly
arranged
*NL*
with
the
Turk
that
if
the
latter
should
find
a
favourable
opportunity
*NL*
for
escape
before
Felix
could
return
to
Italy
,
Safie
should
remain
as
a
*NL*
boarder
at
a
convent
at
Leghorn
;
and
then
,
quitting
the
lovely
Arabian
,
*NL*
he
hastened
to
Paris
and
delivered
himself
up
to
the
vengeance
of
the
*NL*
law
,
hoping
to
free
De
Lacey
and
Agatha
by
this
proceeding

He
did
not
succeed

They
remained
confined
for
five
months
before
the
*NL*
trial
took
place
,
the
result
of
which
deprived
them
of
their
fortune
*NL*
and
condemned
them
to
a
perpetual
exile
from
their
native
country

*NL*
``
They
found
a
miserable
asylum
in
the
cottage
in
Germany
,
where
I
*NL*
discovered
them
.
Felix
soon
learned
that
the
treacherous
Turk
,
for
*NL*
whom
he
and
his
family
endured
such
unheard-of
oppression
,
on
*NL*
discovering
that
his
deliverer
was
thus
reduced
to
poverty
and
ruin
,
*NL*
became
a
traitor
to
good
feeling
and
honour
and
had
quitted
Italy
with
*NL*
his
daughter
,
insultingly
sending
Felix
a
pittance
of
money
to
aid
him
,
*NL*
as
he
said
,
in
some
plan
of
future
maintenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
were
the
events
that
preyed
on
the
heart
of
Felix
and
rendered
*NL*
him
,
when
I
first
saw
him
,
the
most
miserable
of
his
family
.
He
could
*NL*
have
endured
poverty
,
and
while
this
distress
had
been
the
meed
of
his
*NL*
virtue
,
he
gloried
in
it
;
but
the
ingratitude
of
the
Turk
and
the
loss
*NL*
of
his
beloved
Safie
were
misfortunes
more
bitter
and
irreparable
.
The
*NL*
arrival
of
the
Arabian
now
infused
new
life
into
his
soul
.

*NL*
``
When
the
news
reached
Leghorn
that
Felix
was
deprived
of
his
wealth
*NL*
and
rank
,
the
merchant
commanded
his
daughter
to
think
no
more
of
her
*NL*
lover
,
but
to
prepare
to
return
to
her
native
country
.
The
generous
*NL*
nature
of
Safie
was
outraged
by
this
command
;
she
attempted
to
*NL*
expostulate
with
her
father
,
but
he
left
her
angrily
,
reiterating
his
*NL*
tyrannical
mandate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
few
days
after
,
the
Turk
entered
his
daughter
's
apartment
and
told
*NL*
her
hastily
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
his
residence
at
Leghorn
*NL*
had
been
divulged
and
that
he
should
speedily
be
delivered
up
to
the
*NL*
French
government
;
he
had
consequently
hired
a
vessel
to
convey
him
to
*NL*
Constantinople
,
for
which
city
he
should
sail
in
a
few
hours
.
He
*NL*
intended
to
leave
his
daughter
under
the
care
of
a
confidential
*NL*
servant
,
to
follow
at
her
leisure
with
the
greater
part
of
his
*NL*
property
,
which
had
not
yet
arrived
at
Leghorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
alone
,
Safie
resolved
in
her
own
mind
the
plan
of
conduct
that
it
*NL*
would
become
her
to
pursue
in
this
emergency
.
A
residence
in
Turkey
*NL*
was
abhorrent
to
her
;
her
religion
and
her
feelings
were
alike
averse
*NL*
to
it
.
By
some
papers
of
her
father
which
fell
into
her
hands
she
*NL*
heard
of
the
exile
of
her
lover
and
learnt
the
name
of
the
spot
where
*NL*
he
then
resided
.
She
hesitated
some
time
,
but
at
length
she
formed
her
*NL*
determination
.
Taking
with
her
some
jewels
that
belonged
to
her
and
a
*NL*
sum
of
money
,
she
quitted
Italy
with
an
attendant
,
a
native
of
Leghorn
,
*NL*
but
who
understood
the
common
language
of
Turkey
,
and
departed
for
*NL*
Germany
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
arrived
in
safety
at
a
town
about
twenty
leagues
from
the
cottage
*NL*
of
De
Lacey
,
when
her
attendant
fell
dangerously
ill
.
Safie
nursed
her
*NL*
with
the
most
devoted
affection
,
but
the
poor
girl
died
,
and
the
*NL*
Arabian
was
left
alone
,
unacquainted
with
the
language
of
the
country
*NL*
and
utterly
ignorant
of
the
customs
of
the
world
.
She
fell
,
however
,
*NL*
into
good
hands
.
The
Italian
had
mentioned
the
name
of
the
spot
for
*NL*
which
they
were
bound
,
and
after
her
death
the
woman
of
the
house
in
*NL*
which
they
had
lived
took
care
that
Safie
should
arrive
in
safety
at
*NL*
the
cottage
of
her
lover

Chapter
15
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
was
the
history
of
my
beloved
cottagers
.
It
impressed
me
deeply
.
*NL*
I
learned
,
from
the
views
of
social
life
which
it
developed
,
to
admire
*NL*
their
virtues
and
to
deprecate
the
vices
of
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
yet
I
looked
upon
crime
as
a
distant
evil
,
benevolence
and
*NL*
generosity
were
ever
present
before
me
,
inciting
within
me
a
desire
to
*NL*
become
an
actor
in
the
busy
scene
where
so
many
admirable
qualities
*NL*
were
called
forth
and
displayed
.
But
in
giving
an
account
of
the
*NL*
progress
of
my
intellect
,
I
must
not
omit
a
circumstance
which
occurred
*NL*
in
the
beginning
of
the
month
of
August
of
the
same
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
night
during
my
accustomed
visit
to
the
neighbouring
wood
where
I
*NL*
collected
my
own
food
and
brought
home
firing
for
my
protectors
,
I
*NL*
found
on
the
ground
a
leathern
portmanteau
containing
several
articles
*NL*
of
dress
and
some
books
.
I
eagerly
seized
the
prize
and
returned
with
*NL*
it
to
my
hovel
.
Fortunately
the
books
were
written
in
the
language
,
*NL*
the
elements
of
which
I
had
acquired
at
the
cottage
;
they
consisted
of
*NL*
Paradise
Lost
,
a
volume
of
Plutarch
's
Lives
,
and
the
Sorrows
of
Werter
.
*NL*
The
possession
of
these
treasures
gave
me
extreme
delight
;
I
now
*NL*
continually
studied
and
exercised
my
mind
upon
these
histories
,
whilst
*NL*
my
friends
were
employed
in
their
ordinary
occupations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hardly
describe
to
you
the
effect
of
these
books
.
They
produced
*NL*
in
me
an
infinity
of
new
images
and
feelings
,
that
sometimes
raised
me
*NL*
to
ecstasy
,
but
more
frequently
sunk
me
into
the
lowest
dejection
.
In
*NL*
the
Sorrows
of
Werter
,
besides
the
interest
of
its
simple
and
affecting
*NL*
story
,
so
many
opinions
are
canvassed
and
so
many
lights
thrown
upon
*NL*
what
had
hitherto
been
to
me
obscure
subjects
that
I
found
in
it
a
*NL*
never-ending
source
of
speculation
and
astonishment
.
The
gentle
and
*NL*
domestic
manners
it
described
,
combined
with
lofty
sentiments
and
*NL*
feelings
,
which
had
for
their
object
something
out
of
self
,
accorded
*NL*
well
with
my
experience
among
my
protectors
and
with
the
wants
which
*NL*
were
forever
alive
in
my
own
bosom
.
But
I
thought
Werter
himself
a
*NL*
more
divine
being
than
I
had
ever
beheld
or
imagined
;
his
character
*NL*
contained
no
pretension
,
but
it
sank
deep
.
The
disquisitions
upon
*NL*
death
and
suicide
were
calculated
to
fill
me
with
wonder
.
I
did
not
*NL*
pretend
to
enter
into
the
merits
of
the
case
,
yet
I
inclined
towards
*NL*
the
opinions
of
the
hero
,
whose
extinction
I
wept
,
without
precisely
*NL*
understanding
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
read
,
however
,
I
applied
much
personally
to
my
own
feelings
and
*NL*
condition
.
I
found
myself
similar
yet
at
the
same
time
strangely
*NL*
unlike
to
the
beings
concerning
whom
I
read
and
to
whose
conversation
I
*NL*
was
a
listener
.
I
sympathized
with
and
partly
understood
them
,
but
I
*NL*
was
unformed
in
mind
;
I
was
dependent
on
none
and
related
to
none
.
*NL*
`
The
path
of
my
departure
was
free
,
'
and
there
was
none
to
lament
my
*NL*
annihilation
.
My
person
was
hideous
and
my
stature
gigantic
.
What
did
*NL*
this
mean
?
Who
was
I
?
What
was
I
?
Whence
did
I
come
?
What
was
my
*NL*
destination
?
These
questions
continually
recurred
,
but
I
was
unable
to
*NL*
solve
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
volume
of
Plutarch
's
Lives
which
I
possessed
contained
the
*NL*
histories
of
the
first
founders
of
the
ancient
republics
.
This
book
*NL*
had
a
far
different
effect
upon
me
from
the
Sorrows
of
Werter
.
I
*NL*
learned
from
Werter
's
imaginations
despondency
and
gloom
,
but
Plutarch
*NL*
taught
me
high
thoughts
;
he
elevated
me
above
the
wretched
sphere
of
my
*NL*
own
reflections
,
to
admire
and
love
the
heroes
of
past
ages
.
Many
*NL*
things
I
read
surpassed
my
understanding
and
experience
.
I
had
a
very
*NL*
confused
knowledge
of
kingdoms
,
wide
extents
of
country
,
mighty
rivers
,
*NL*
and
boundless
seas
.
But
I
was
perfectly
unacquainted
with
towns
and
*NL*
large
assemblages
of
men
.
The
cottage
of
my
protectors
had
been
the
*NL*
only
school
in
which
I
had
studied
human
nature
,
but
this
book
*NL*
developed
new
and
mightier
scenes
of
action
.
I
read
of
men
concerned
*NL*
in
public
affairs
,
governing
or
massacring
their
species
.
I
felt
the
*NL*
greatest
ardour
for
virtue
rise
within
me
,
and
abhorrence
for
vice
,
as
*NL*
far
as
I
understood
the
signification
of
those
terms
,
relative
as
they
*NL*
were
,
as
I
applied
them
,
to
pleasure
and
pain
alone
.
Induced
by
these
*NL*
feelings
,
I
was
of
course
led
to
admire
peaceable
lawgivers
,
Numa
,
*NL*
Solon
,
and
Lycurgus
,
in
preference
to
Romulus
and
Theseus
.
The
*NL*
patriarchal
lives
of
my
protectors
caused
these
impressions
to
take
a
*NL*
firm
hold
on
my
mind
;
perhaps
,
if
my
first
introduction
to
humanity
had
*NL*
been
made
by
a
young
soldier
,
burning
for
glory
and
slaughter
,
I
should
*NL*
have
been
imbued
with
different
sensations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Paradise
Lost
excited
different
and
far
deeper
emotions
.
I
read
*NL*
it
,
as
I
had
read
the
other
volumes
which
had
fallen
into
my
hands
,
as
*NL*
a
true
history
.
It
moved
every
feeling
of
wonder
and
awe
that
the
*NL*
picture
of
an
omnipotent
God
warring
with
his
creatures
was
capable
of
*NL*
exciting
.
I
often
referred
the
several
situations
,
as
their
similarity
*NL*
struck
me
,
to
my
own
.
Like
Adam
,
I
was
apparently
united
by
no
link
to
*NL*
any
other
being
in
existence
;
but
his
state
was
far
different
from
mine
*NL*
in
every
other
respect
.
He
had
come
forth
from
the
hands
of
God
a
*NL*
perfect
creature
,
happy
and
prosperous
,
guarded
by
the
especial
care
of
*NL*
his
Creator
;
he
was
allowed
to
converse
with
and
acquire
knowledge
from
*NL*
beings
of
a
superior
nature
,
but
I
was
wretched
,
helpless
,
and
alone
.
*NL*
Many
times
I
considered
Satan
as
the
fitter
emblem
of
my
condition
,
for
*NL*
often
,
like
him
,
when
I
viewed
the
bliss
of
my
protectors
,
the
bitter
*NL*
gall
of
envy
rose
within
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
circumstance
strengthened
and
confirmed
these
feelings
.
Soon
*NL*
after
my
arrival
in
the
hovel
I
discovered
some
papers
in
the
pocket
of
*NL*
the
dress
which
I
had
taken
from
your
laboratory
.
At
first
I
had
*NL*
neglected
them
,
but
now
that
I
was
able
to
decipher
the
characters
in
*NL*
which
they
were
written
,
I
began
to
study
them
with
diligence
.
It
was
*NL*
your
journal
of
the
four
months
that
preceded
my
creation
.
You
*NL*
minutely
described
in
these
papers
every
step
you
took
in
the
progress
*NL*
of
your
work
;
this
history
was
mingled
with
accounts
of
domestic
*NL*
occurrences
.
You
doubtless
recollect
these
papers
.
Here
they
are
.
*NL*
Everything
is
related
in
them
which
bears
reference
to
my
accursed
*NL*
origin
;
the
whole
detail
of
that
series
of
disgusting
circumstances
*NL*
which
produced
it
is
set
in
view
;
the
minutest
description
of
my
odious
*NL*
and
loathsome
person
is
given
,
in
language
which
painted
your
own
*NL*
horrors
and
rendered
mine
indelible
.
I
sickened
as
I
read
.
`
Hateful
*NL*
day
when
I
received
life
!
'
I
exclaimed
in
agony
.
`
Accursed
creator
!
*NL*
Why
did
you
form
a
monster
so
hideous
that
even
YOU
turned
from
me
in
*NL*
disgust
?
God
,
in
pity
,
made
man
beautiful
and
alluring
,
after
his
own
*NL*
image
;
but
my
form
is
a
filthy
type
of
yours
,
more
horrid
even
from
the
*NL*
very
resemblance
.
Satan
had
his
companions
,
fellow
devils
,
to
admire
*NL*
and
encourage
him
,
but
I
am
solitary
and
abhorred
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
were
the
reflections
of
my
hours
of
despondency
and
solitude
;
*NL*
but
when
I
contemplated
the
virtues
of
the
cottagers
,
their
amiable
and
*NL*
benevolent
dispositions
,
I
persuaded
myself
that
when
they
should
*NL*
become
acquainted
with
my
admiration
of
their
virtues
they
would
*NL*
compassionate
me
and
overlook
my
personal
deformity
.
Could
they
turn
*NL*
from
their
door
one
,
however
monstrous
,
who
solicited
their
compassion
*NL*
and
friendship
?
I
resolved
,
at
least
,
not
to
despair
,
but
in
every
way
*NL*
to
fit
myself
for
an
interview
with
them
which
would
decide
my
fate
.
I
*NL*
postponed
this
attempt
for
some
months
longer
,
for
the
importance
*NL*
attached
to
its
success
inspired
me
with
a
dread
lest
I
should
fail
.
*NL*
Besides
,
I
found
that
my
understanding
improved
so
much
with
every
*NL*
day
's
experience
that
I
was
unwilling
to
commence
this
undertaking
*NL*
until
a
few
more
months
should
have
added
to
my
sagacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Several
changes
,
in
the
meantime
,
took
place
in
the
cottage
.
The
*NL*
presence
of
Safie
diffused
happiness
among
its
inhabitants
,
and
I
also
*NL*
found
that
a
greater
degree
of
plenty
reigned
there
.
Felix
and
Agatha
*NL*
spent
more
time
in
amusement
and
conversation
,
and
were
assisted
in
*NL*
their
labours
by
servants
.
They
did
not
appear
rich
,
but
they
were
*NL*
contented
and
happy
;
their
feelings
were
serene
and
peaceful
,
while
*NL*
mine
became
every
day
more
tumultuous
.
Increase
of
knowledge
only
*NL*
discovered
to
me
more
clearly
what
a
wretched
outcast
I
was
.
I
*NL*
cherished
hope
,
it
is
true
,
but
it
vanished
when
I
beheld
my
person
*NL*
reflected
in
water
or
my
shadow
in
the
moonshine
,
even
as
that
frail
*NL*
image
and
that
inconstant
shade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
endeavoured
to
crush
these
fears
and
to
fortify
myself
for
the
trial
*NL*
which
in
a
few
months
I
resolved
to
undergo
;
and
sometimes
I
allowed
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
unchecked
by
reason
,
to
ramble
in
the
fields
of
Paradise
,
and
*NL*
dared
to
fancy
amiable
and
lovely
creatures
sympathizing
with
my
*NL*
feelings
and
cheering
my
gloom
;
their
angelic
countenances
breathed
*NL*
smiles
of
consolation
.
But
it
was
all
a
dream
;
no
Eve
soothed
my
*NL*
sorrows
nor
shared
my
thoughts
;
I
was
alone
.
I
remembered
Adam
's
*NL*
supplication
to
his
Creator
.
But
where
was
mine
?
He
had
abandoned
me
,
*NL*
and
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
I
cursed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Autumn
passed
thus
.
I
saw
,
with
surprise
and
grief
,
the
leaves
decay
*NL*
and
fall
,
and
nature
again
assume
the
barren
and
bleak
appearance
it
*NL*
had
worn
when
I
first
beheld
the
woods
and
the
lovely
moon
.
Yet
I
did
*NL*
not
heed
the
bleakness
of
the
weather
;
I
was
better
fitted
by
my
*NL*
conformation
for
the
endurance
of
cold
than
heat
.
But
my
chief
*NL*
delights
were
the
sight
of
the
flowers
,
the
birds
,
and
all
the
gay
*NL*
apparel
of
summer
;
when
those
deserted
me
,
I
turned
with
more
attention
*NL*
towards
the
cottagers
.
Their
happiness
was
not
decreased
by
the
*NL*
absence
of
summer
.
They
loved
and
sympathized
with
one
another
;
and
*NL*
their
joys
,
depending
on
each
other
,
were
not
interrupted
by
the
*NL*
casualties
that
took
place
around
them
.
The
more
I
saw
of
them
,
the
*NL*
greater
became
my
desire
to
claim
their
protection
and
kindness
;
my
*NL*
heart
yearned
to
be
known
and
loved
by
these
amiable
creatures
;
to
see
*NL*
their
sweet
looks
directed
towards
me
with
affection
was
the
utmost
*NL*
limit
of
my
ambition
.
I
dared
not
think
that
they
would
turn
them
from
*NL*
me
with
disdain
and
horror
.
The
poor
that
stopped
at
their
door
were
*NL*
never
driven
away
.
I
asked
,
it
is
true
,
for
greater
treasures
than
a
*NL*
little
food
or
rest
:
I
required
kindness
and
sympathy
;
but
I
did
not
*NL*
believe
myself
utterly
unworthy
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
winter
advanced
,
and
an
entire
revolution
of
the
seasons
had
taken
*NL*
place
since
I
awoke
into
life
.
My
attention
at
this
time
was
solely
*NL*
directed
towards
my
plan
of
introducing
myself
into
the
cottage
of
my
*NL*
protectors
.
I
revolved
many
projects
,
but
that
on
which
I
finally
*NL*
fixed
was
to
enter
the
dwelling
when
the
blind
old
man
should
be
alone
.
*NL*
I
had
sagacity
enough
to
discover
that
the
unnatural
hideousness
of
my
*NL*
person
was
the
chief
object
of
horror
with
those
who
had
formerly
*NL*
beheld
me
.
My
voice
,
although
harsh
,
had
nothing
terrible
in
it
;
I
*NL*
thought
,
therefore
,
that
if
in
the
absence
of
his
children
I
could
gain
*NL*
the
good
will
and
mediation
of
the
old
De
Lacey
,
I
might
by
his
means
*NL*
be
tolerated
by
my
younger
protectors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
,
when
the
sun
shone
on
the
red
leaves
that
strewed
the
ground
*NL*
and
diffused
cheerfulness
,
although
it
denied
warmth
,
Safie
,
Agatha
,
*NL*
and
Felix
departed
on
a
long
country
walk
,
and
the
old
man
,
at
his
own
*NL*
desire
,
was
left
alone
in
the
cottage
.
When
his
children
had
departed
,
*NL*
he
took
up
his
guitar
and
played
several
mournful
but
sweet
airs
,
more
*NL*
sweet
and
mournful
than
I
had
ever
heard
him
play
before
.
At
first
his
*NL*
countenance
was
illuminated
with
pleasure
,
but
as
he
continued
,
*NL*
thoughtfulness
and
sadness
succeeded
;
at
length
,
laying
aside
the
*NL*
instrument
,
he
sat
absorbed
in
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
heart
beat
quick
;
this
was
the
hour
and
moment
of
trial
,
which
*NL*
would
decide
my
hopes
or
realize
my
fears
.
The
servants
were
gone
to
a
*NL*
neighbouring
fair
.
All
was
silent
in
and
around
the
cottage
;
it
was
an
*NL*
excellent
opportunity
;
yet
,
when
I
proceeded
to
execute
my
plan
,
my
*NL*
limbs
failed
me
and
I
sank
to
the
ground
.
Again
I
rose
,
and
exerting
*NL*
all
the
firmness
of
which
I
was
master
,
removed
the
planks
which
I
had
*NL*
placed
before
my
hovel
to
conceal
my
retreat
.
The
fresh
air
revived
*NL*
me
,
and
with
renewed
determination
I
approached
the
door
of
their
*NL*
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knocked
.

Who
is
there

the
old
man

Come
in

*NL*
``
I
entered

`
Pardon
this
intrusion

said
I
;
'
I
am
a
traveller
in

of
a
little
rest

you
would
greatly
oblige
me

remain
a
few
minutes
before
the
fire

Enter

said
De
Lacey
,

I
will
try
in
what
manner
I
can
to
*NL*
relieve
your
wants
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
my
children
are
from
home
,
and
*NL*
as
I
am
blind
,
I
am
afraid
I
shall
find
it
difficult
to
procure
food
*NL*
for
you

Do
not
trouble
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sat
down
,
and
a
silence
ensued
.
I
knew
that
every
minute
was
*NL*
precious
to
me
,
yet
I
remained
irresolute
in
what
manner
to
commence
*NL*
the
interview
,
when
the
old
man
addressed
me
.
`
By
your
language

I
suppose
you
are
my
countryman

are
you
French

''
`
No

I
was
educated
by
a
French

now
going
to
claim
the
protection

I
sincerely
love

whose

have
some
hopes

Germans

No

let
us
change
the
subject

unfortunate

deserted
creature

I
look
around
and
I
have
no
relation

These
amiable
people
to
whom
I
go
have
never
*NL*
seen
me

know
little
of
me
.
I
am
full
of
fears
,

if
I
fail
*NL*
there
,
I
am
an
outcast
in
the
world
forever
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
not
despair

To
be
friendless
is
indeed
to
be
unfortunate
,
but
*NL*
the
hearts
of
men
,
when
unprejudiced
by
any
obvious
self-interest

are
*NL*
full
of
brotherly
love

Rely

these

are
good

not
despair

they

they
are
prejudiced
against

I

been
hitherto
harmless

they
behold
only
a
detestable
*NL*
monster

`
That
is
indeed
unfortunate

not

I

about

the
moment

decision

When
night

in

now
,
no
longer
restrained
by
the
fear

I
gave
vent

my

had
broken

destroying

obstructed

ranging

night
I
passed
!
The
cold
stars
shone
in
mockery

the
bare
trees

waved
their
branches
above
me
;
now
and
then
the
sweet
voice
of
a
bird
*NL*
burst
forth
amidst
the
universal
stillness

I

were
at
rest

in
enjoyment

,
like
the
arch-fiend

bore
a

unsympathized

spread

havoc

sat
down

this
was
a
luxury

fatigued
with
excess
of
bodily
exertion
and
sank
on
the
damp
grass
in
*NL*
the
sick
impotence

despair

There
was
none

myriads

existed

should

No

from

I
declared
everlasting
war

species

more
than
all

I
hid

myself
in

reflection

The
pleasant
sunshine

restored
me
to
some

degree

tranquillity

when
I
considered
what
had
passed
at

cottage

I
could
not
help
believing
that
I
had
been
too
hasty

had
certainly

imprudently

was
apparent

I
was
a

fool

have
familiarized
the

degrees

have
discovered
myself
to
the
rest

been
prepared

I
did
not
believe
my
errors
to
be
*NL*
irretrievable

after
much
consideration
I
resolved
to
return
to
the
*NL*
cottage

seek
the
old
man

by
my
representations
win
him
to
my

party

calmed
me

in
the
afternoon
I
sank
into
a
profound

sleep
;
but
the
fever
of
my
blood
did
not
allow
me
to
be
visited
by
*NL*
peaceful
dreams
.
The
horrible
scene
of
the
preceding
day
was
forever
*NL*
acting
before
my
eyes
;
the
females
were
flying
and
the
enraged
Felix
*NL*
tearing
me
from
his
father
's
feet
.
I
awoke
exhausted
,
and
finding
that
*NL*
it
was
already
night
,
I
crept
forth
from
my
hiding-place
,
and
went
in
*NL*
search
of
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
hunger
was
appeased
,
I
directed
my
steps
towards
the
*NL*
well-known
path
that
conducted
to
the
cottage
.
All
there
was
at
peace
.
*NL*
I
crept
into
my
hovel
and
remained
in
silent
expectation
of
the
*NL*
accustomed
hour
when
the
family
arose
.
That
hour
passed
,
the
sun
*NL*
mounted
high
in
the
heavens
,
but
the
cottagers
did
not
appear
.
I
*NL*
trembled
violently
,
apprehending
some
dreadful
misfortune
.
The
inside
*NL*
of
the
cottage
was
dark
,
and
I
heard
no
motion
;
I
can
not
describe
the
*NL*
agony
of
this
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently
two
countrymen
passed
by
,
but
pausing
near
the
cottage
,
they
*NL*
entered
into
conversation
,
using
violent
gesticulations
;
but
I
did
not
*NL*
understand
what
they
said
,
as
they
spoke
the
language
of
the
country
,
*NL*
which
differed
from
that
of
my
protectors
.
Soon
after
,
however
,
Felix
*NL*
approached
with
another
man
;
I
was
surprised
,
as
I
knew
that
he
had
not
*NL*
quitted
the
cottage
that
morning
,
and
waited
anxiously
to
discover
from
*NL*
his
discourse
the
meaning
of
these
unusual
appearances
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
you
consider
,
'
said
his
companion
to
him
,
`
that
you
will
be
*NL*
obliged
to
pay
three
months
'
rent
and
to
lose
the
produce
of
your
*NL*
garden
?
I
do
not
wish
to
take
any
unfair
advantage
,
and
I
beg
*NL*
therefore
that
you
will
take
some
days
to
consider
of
your
*NL*
determination
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
is
utterly
useless
,
'
replied
Felix
;
`
we
can
never
again
inhabit
*NL*
your
cottage
.
The
life
of
my
father
is
in
the
greatest
danger
,
owing
*NL*
to
the
dreadful
circumstance
that
I
have
related
.
My
wife
and
my
*NL*
sister
will
never
recover
from
their
horror
.
I
entreat
you
not
to
*NL*
reason
with
me
any
more
.
Take
possession
of
your
tenement
and
let
me
*NL*
fly
from
this
place
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felix
trembled
violently
as
he
said
this
.
He
and
his
companion
*NL*
entered
the
cottage
,
in
which
they
remained
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
then
*NL*
departed
.
I
never
saw
any
of
the
family
of
De
Lacey
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
continued
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
my
hovel
in
a
state
of
*NL*
utter
and
stupid
despair
.
My
protectors
had
departed
and
had
broken
*NL*
the
only
link
that
held
me
to
the
world
.
For
the
first
time
the
*NL*
feelings
of
revenge
and
hatred
filled
my
bosom
,
and
I
did
not
strive
to
*NL*
control
them
,
but
allowing
myself
to
be
borne
away
by
the
stream
,
I
*NL*
bent
my
mind
towards
injury
and
death
.
When
I
thought
of
my
friends
,
*NL*
of
the
mild
voice
of
De
Lacey
,
the
gentle
eyes
of
Agatha
,
and
the
*NL*
exquisite
beauty
of
the
Arabian
,
these
thoughts
vanished
and
a
gush
of
*NL*
tears
somewhat
soothed
me
.
But
again
when
I
reflected
that
they
had
*NL*
spurned
and
deserted
me
,
anger
returned
,
a
rage
of
anger
,
and
unable
to
*NL*
injure
anything
human
,
I
turned
my
fury
towards
inanimate
objects
.
As
*NL*
night
advanced
I
placed
a
variety
of
combustibles
around
the
cottage
,
*NL*
and
after
having
destroyed
every
vestige
of
cultivation
in
the
garden
,
*NL*
I
waited
with
forced
impatience
until
the
moon
had
sunk
to
commence
my
*NL*
operations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the
night
advanced
,
a
fierce
wind
arose
from
the
woods
and
quickly
*NL*
dispersed
the
clouds
that
had
loitered
in
the
heavens
;
the
blast
tore
*NL*
along
like
a
mighty
avalanche
and
produced
a
kind
of
insanity
in
my
*NL*
spirits
that
burst
all
bounds
of
reason
and
reflection
.
I
lighted
the
*NL*
dry
branch
of
a
tree
and
danced
with
fury
around
the
devoted
cottage
,
*NL*
my
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
western
horizon
,
the
edge
of
which
the
moon
*NL*
nearly
touched
.
A
part
of
its
orb
was
at
length
hid
,
and
I
waved
my
*NL*
brand
;
it
sank
,
and
with
a
loud
scream
I
fired
the
straw
,
and
heath
,
*NL*
and
bushes
,
which
I
had
collected
.
The
wind
fanned
the
fire
,
and
the
*NL*
cottage
was
quickly
enveloped
by
the
flames
,
which
clung
to
it
and
*NL*
licked
it
with
their
forked
and
destroying
tongues
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
I
was
convinced
that
no
assistance
could
save
any
part
of
*NL*
the
habitation
,
I
quitted
the
scene
and
sought
for
refuge
in
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
with
the
world
before
me
,
whither
should
I
bend
my
steps
?
I
*NL*
resolved
to
fly
far
from
the
scene
of
my
misfortunes
;
but
to
me
,
hated
*NL*
and
despised
,
every
country
must
be
equally
horrible
.
At
length
the
*NL*
thought
of
you
crossed
my
mind
.
I
learned
from
your
papers
that
you
*NL*
were
my
father
,
my
creator
;
and
to
whom
could
I
apply
with
more
fitness
*NL*
than
to
him
who
had
given
me
life
?
Among
the
lessons
that
Felix
had
*NL*
bestowed
upon
Safie
,
geography
had
not
been
omitted
;
I
had
learned
from
*NL*
these
the
relative
situations
of
the
different
countries
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
You
had
mentioned
Geneva
as
the
name
of
your
native
town
,
and
towards
*NL*
this
place
I
resolved
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
was
I
to
direct
myself
?
I
knew
that
I
must
travel
in
a
*NL*
southwesterly
direction
to
reach
my
destination
,
but
the
sun
was
my
*NL*
only
guide
.
I
did
not
know
the
names
of
the
towns
that
I
was
to
pass
*NL*
through
,
nor
could
I
ask
information
from
a
single
human
being
;
but
I
*NL*
did
not
despair
.
From
you
only
could
I
hope
for
succour
,
although
*NL*
towards
you
I
felt
no
sentiment
but
that
of
hatred
.
Unfeeling
,
*NL*
heartless
creator
!
You
had
endowed
me
with
perceptions
and
passions
*NL*
and
then
cast
me
abroad
an
object
for
the
scorn
and
horror
of
mankind
.
*NL*
But
on
you
only
had
I
any
claim
for
pity
and
redress
,
and
from
you
I
*NL*
determined
to
seek
that
justice
which
I
vainly
attempted
to
gain
from
*NL*
any
other
being
that
wore
the
human
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
travels
were
long
and
the
sufferings
I
endured
intense
.
It
was
*NL*
late
in
autumn
when
I
quitted
the
district
where
I
had
so
long
resided
.
*NL*
I
travelled
only
at
night
,
fearful
of
encountering
the
visage
of
a
*NL*
human
being
.
Nature
decayed
around
me
,
and
the
sun
became
heatless
;
*NL*
rain
and
snow
poured
around
me
;
mighty
rivers
were
frozen
;
the
surface
*NL*
of
the
earth
was
hard
and
chill
,
and
bare
,
and
I
found
no
shelter
.
Oh
,
*NL*
earth
!
How
often
did
I
imprecate
curses
on
the
cause
of
my
being
!
The
*NL*
mildness
of
my
nature
had
fled
,
and
all
within
me
was
turned
to
gall
*NL*
and
bitterness
.
The
nearer
I
approached
to
your
habitation
,
the
more
*NL*
deeply
did
I
feel
the
spirit
of
revenge
enkindled
in
my
heart
.
Snow
*NL*
fell
,
and
the
waters
were
hardened
,
but
I
rested
not
.
A
few
incidents
*NL*
now
and
then
directed
me
,
and
I
possessed
a
map
of
the
country
;
but
I
*NL*
often
wandered
wide
from
my
path
.
The
agony
of
my
feelings
allowed
me
*NL*
no
respite
;
no
incident
occurred
from
which
my
rage
and
misery
could
*NL*
not
extract
its
food
;
but
a
circumstance
that
happened
when
I
arrived
*NL*
on
the
confines
of
Switzerland
,
when
the
sun
had
recovered
its
warmth
*NL*
and
the
earth
again
began
to
look
green
,
confirmed
in
an
especial
*NL*
manner
the
bitterness
and
horror
of
my
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
generally
rested
during
the
day
and
travelled
only
when
I
was
*NL*
secured
by
night
from
the
view
of
man
.
One
morning
,
however
,
finding
*NL*
that
my
path
lay
through
a
deep
wood
,
I
ventured
to
continue
my
journey
*NL*
after
the
sun
had
risen
;
the
day
,
which
was
one
of
the
first
of
spring
,
*NL*
cheered
even
me
by
the
loveliness
of
its
sunshine
and
the
balminess
of
*NL*
the
air
.
I
felt
emotions
of
gentleness
and
pleasure
,
that
had
long
*NL*
appeared
dead
,
revive
within
me
.
Half
surprised
by
the
novelty
of
*NL*
these
sensations
,
I
allowed
myself
to
be
borne
away
by
them
,
and
*NL*
forgetting
my
solitude
and
deformity
,
dared
to
be
happy
.
Soft
tears
*NL*
again
bedewed
my
cheeks
,
and
I
even
raised
my
humid
eyes
with
*NL*
thankfulness
towards
the
blessed
sun
,
which
bestowed
such
joy
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
continued
to
wind
among
the
paths
of
the
wood
,
until
I
came
to
its
*NL*
boundary
,
which
was
skirted
by
a
deep
and
rapid
river
,
into
which
many
*NL*
of
the
trees
bent
their
branches
,
now
budding
with
the
fresh
spring
.
*NL*
Here
I
paused
,
not
exactly
knowing
what
path
to
pursue
,
when
I
heard
*NL*
the
sound
of
voices
,
that
induced
me
to
conceal
myself
under
the
shade
*NL*
of
a
cypress
.
I
was
scarcely
hid
when
a
young
girl
came
running
*NL*
towards
the
spot
where
I
was
concealed
,
laughing
,
as
if
she
ran
from
*NL*
someone
in
sport
.
She
continued
her
course
along
the
precipitous
sides
*NL*
of
the
river
,
when
suddenly
her
foot
slipped
,
and
she
fell
into
the
*NL*
rapid
stream
.
I
rushed
from
my
hiding-place
and
with
extreme
labour
,
*NL*
from
the
force
of
the
current
,
saved
her
and
dragged
her
to
shore
.
She
*NL*
was
senseless
,
and
I
endeavoured
by
every
means
in
my
power
to
restore
*NL*
animation
,
when
I
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
a
rustic
,
*NL*
who
was
probably
the
person
from
whom
she
had
playfully
fled
.
On
*NL*
seeing
me
,
he
darted
towards
me
,
and
tearing
the
girl
from
my
arms
,
*NL*
hastened
towards
the
deeper
parts
of
the
wood
.
I
followed
speedily
,
I
*NL*
hardly
knew
why
;
but
when
the
man
saw
me
draw
near
,
he
aimed
a
gun
,
*NL*
which
he
carried
,
at
my
body
and
fired
.
I
sank
to
the
ground
,
and
my
*NL*
injurer
,
with
increased
swiftness
,
escaped
into
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
then
the
reward
of
my
benevolence
!
I
had
saved
a
human
being
*NL*
from
destruction
,
and
as
a
recompense
I
now
writhed
under
the
miserable
*NL*
pain
of
a
wound
which
shattered
the
flesh
and
bone
.
The
feelings
of
*NL*
kindness
and
gentleness
which
I
had
entertained
but
a
few
moments
*NL*
before
gave
place
to
hellish
rage
and
gnashing
of
teeth
.
Inflamed
by
*NL*
pain
,
I
vowed
eternal
hatred
and
vengeance
to
all
mankind
.
But
the
*NL*
agony
of
my
wound
overcame
me
;
my
pulses
paused
,
and
I
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
some
weeks
I
led
a
miserable
life
in
the
woods
,
endeavouring
to
*NL*
cure
the
wound
which
I
had
received
.
The
ball
had
entered
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
I
knew
not
whether
it
had
remained
there
or
passed
through
;
at
any
*NL*
rate
I
had
no
means
of
extracting
it
.
My
sufferings
were
augmented
*NL*
also
by
the
oppressive
sense
of
the
injustice
and
ingratitude
of
their
*NL*
infliction
.
My
daily
vows
rose
for
revenge
--
a
deep
and
deadly
revenge
,
*NL*
such
as
would
alone
compensate
for
the
outrages
and
anguish
I
had
*NL*
endured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
some
weeks
my
wound
healed
,
and
I
continued
my
journey
.
The
*NL*
labours
I
endured
were
no
longer
to
be
alleviated
by
the
bright
sun
or
*NL*
gentle
breezes
of
spring
;
all
joy
was
but
a
mockery
which
insulted
my
*NL*
desolate
state
and
made
me
feel
more
painfully
that
I
was
not
made
for
*NL*
the
enjoyment
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
toils
now
drew
near
a
close
,
and
in
two
months
from
this
time
I
*NL*
reached
the
environs
of
Geneva
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
evening
when
I
arrived
,
and
I
retired
to
a
hiding-place
among
*NL*
the
fields
that
surround
it
to
meditate
in
what
manner
I
should
apply
*NL*
to
you
.
I
was
oppressed
by
fatigue
and
hunger
and
far
too
unhappy
to
*NL*
enjoy
the
gentle
breezes
of
evening
or
the
prospect
of
the
sun
setting
*NL*
behind
the
stupendous
mountains
of
Jura
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
time
a
slight
sleep
relieved
me
from
the
pain
of
reflection
,
*NL*
which
was
disturbed
by
the
approach
of
a
beautiful
child
,
who
came
*NL*
running
into
the
recess
I
had
chosen
,
with
all
the
sportiveness
of
*NL*
infancy
.
Suddenly
,
as
I
gazed
on
him
,
an
idea
seized
me
that
this
*NL*
little
creature
was
unprejudiced
and
had
lived
too
short
a
time
to
have
*NL*
imbibed
a
horror
of
deformity
.
If
,
therefore
,
I
could
seize
him
and
*NL*
educate
him
as
my
companion
and
friend
,
I
should
not
be
so
desolate
in
*NL*
this
peopled
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Urged
by
this
impulse
,
I
seized
on
the
boy
as
he
passed
and
drew
him
*NL*
towards
me
.
As
soon
as
he
beheld
my
form
,
he
placed
his
hands
before
*NL*
his
eyes
and
uttered
a
shrill
scream
;
I
drew
his
hand
forcibly
from
his
*NL*
face
and
said
,
`
Child
,
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
I
do
not
intend
to
*NL*
hurt
you
;
listen
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
struggled
violently
.
`
Let
me
go

he
cried
;
`
monster
!
Ugly
*NL*
wretch
!
You
wish
to
eat
me
and
tear
me
to
pieces
.
You
are
an
ogre

*NL*
Let
me
go
,
or
I
will
tell
my
papa

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Boy
,
you
will
never
see
your
father
again

you
must
come
with

belong
then
to

him
towards
whom
I
have

sworn
eternal
revenge
;

shall
be
my

victim

*NL*
``
The
child
still
struggled
and
loaded
me
with
epithets
which
carried
*NL*
despair
to
my
heart
;
I
grasped
his
throat
to
silence
him
,
and
in
a
*NL*
moment
he
lay
dead
at
my
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gazed
on
my
victim
,
and
my
heart
swelled
with
exultation
and
hellish
*NL*
triumph
;
clapping
my
hands
,
I
exclaimed
,
'
I
too
can
create
desolation
;
*NL*
my
enemy
is
not
invulnerable
;
this
death
will
carry
despair
to
him
,
and
*NL*
a
thousand
other
miseries
shall
torment
and
destroy
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
child
,
I
saw
something
glittering
on
his
*NL*
breast
.
I
took
it
;
it
was
a
portrait
of
a
most
lovely
woman
.
In
spite
*NL*
of
my
malignity
,
it
softened
and
attracted
me
.
For
a
few
moments
I
*NL*
gazed
with
delight
on
her
dark
eyes
,
fringed
by
deep
lashes
,
and
her
*NL*
lovely
lips
;
but
presently
my
rage
returned
;
I
remembered
that
I
was
*NL*
forever
deprived
of
the
delights
that
such
beautiful
creatures
could
*NL*
bestow
and
that
she
whose
resemblance
I
contemplated
would
,
in
*NL*
regarding
me
,
have
changed
that
air
of
divine
benignity
to
one
*NL*
expressive
of
disgust
and
affright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
wonder
that
such
thoughts
transported
me
with
rage
?
I
only
*NL*
wonder
that
at
that
moment
,
instead
of
venting
my
sensations
in
*NL*
exclamations
and
agony
,
I
did
not
rush
among
mankind
and
perish
in
the
*NL*
attempt
to
destroy
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
I
was
overcome
by
these
feelings
,
I
left
the
spot
where
I
had
*NL*
committed
the
murder
,
and
seeking
a
more
secluded
hiding-place
,
I
*NL*
entered
a
barn
which
had
appeared
to
me
to
be
empty
.
A
woman
was
*NL*
sleeping
on
some
straw
;
she
was
young
,
not
indeed
so
beautiful
as
her
*NL*
whose
portrait
I
held
,
but
of
an
agreeable
aspect
and
blooming
in
the
*NL*
loveliness
of
youth
and
health
.
Here
,
I
thought
,
is
one
of
those
whose
*NL*
joy-imparting
smiles
are
bestowed
on
all
but
me
.
And
then
I
bent
over
*NL*
her
and
whispered
,
`
Awake
,
fairest
,
thy
lover
is
near
--
he
who
would
*NL*
give
his
life
but
to
obtain
one
look
of
affection
from
thine
eyes
;
my
*NL*
beloved
,
awake
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sleeper
stirred
;
a
thrill
of
terror
ran
through
me
.
Should
she
*NL*
indeed
awake
,
and
see
me
,
and
curse
me
,
and
denounce
the
murderer
?
Thus
*NL*
would
she
assuredly
act
if
her
darkened
eyes
opened
and
she
beheld
me
.
*NL*
The
thought
was
madness
;
it
stirred
the
fiend
within
me
--
not
I
,
but
*NL*
she
,
shall
suffer
;
the
murder
I
have
committed
because
I
am
forever
*NL*
robbed
of
all
that
she
could
give
me
,
she
shall
atone
.
The
crime
had
*NL*
its
source
in
her
;
be
hers
the
punishment
!
Thanks
to
the
lessons
of
*NL*
Felix
and
the
sanguinary
laws
of
man
,
I
had
learned
now
to
work
*NL*
mischief
.
I
bent
over
her
and
placed
the
portrait
securely
in
one
of
*NL*
the
folds
of
her
dress
.
She
moved
again
,
and
I
fled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
some
days
I
haunted
the
spot
where
these
scenes
had
taken
place
,
*NL*
sometimes
wishing
to
see
you
,
sometimes
resolved
to
quit
the
world
and
*NL*
its
miseries
forever
.
At
length
I
wandered
towards
these
mountains
,
*NL*
and
have
ranged
through
their
immense
recesses
,
consumed
by
a
burning
*NL*
passion
which
you
alone
can
gratify
.
We
may
not
part
until
you
have
*NL*
promised
to
comply
with
my
requisition
.
I
am
alone
and
miserable
;
man
*NL*
will
not
associate
with
me
;
but
one
as
deformed
and
horrible
as
myself
*NL*
would
not
deny
herself
to
me
.
My
companion
must
be
of
the
same
species
*NL*
and
have
the
same
defects
.
This
being
you
must
create
.

The
being
finished
speaking
and
fixed
his
looks
upon
me
in
the
*NL*
expectation
of
a
reply
.
But
I
was
bewildered
,
perplexed
,
and
unable
to
*NL*
arrange
my
ideas
sufficiently
to
understand
the
full
extent
of
his
*NL*
proposition
.
He
continued
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
create
a
female
for
me
with
whom
I
can
live
in
the
*NL*
interchange
of
those
sympathies
necessary
for
my
being
.
This
you
alone
*NL*
can
do
,
and
I
demand
it
of
you
as
a
right
which
you
must
not
refuse
to
*NL*
concede
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
part
of
his
tale
had
kindled
anew
in
me
the
anger
that
had
*NL*
died
away
while
he
narrated
his
peaceful
life
among
the
cottagers
,
and
*NL*
as
he
said
this
I
could
no
longer
suppress
the
rage
that
burned
within
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
refuse
it
,
''
I
replied
;
``
and
no
torture
shall
ever
extort
a
*NL*
consent
from
me
.
You
may
render
me
the
most
miserable
of
men
,
but
you
*NL*
shall
never
make
me
base
in
my
own
eyes
.
Shall
I
create
another
like
*NL*
yourself
,
whose
joint
wickedness
might
desolate
the
world
.
Begone
!
I
*NL*
have
answered
you
;
you
may
torture
me
,
but
I
will
never
consent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
the
wrong
,
''
replied
the
fiend
;
``
and
instead
of
threatening
,
*NL*
I
am
content
to
reason
with
you
.
I
am
malicious
because
I
am
*NL*
miserable
.
Am
I
not
shunned
and
hated
by
all
mankind
?
You
,
my
*NL*
creator
,
would
tear
me
to
pieces
and
triumph
;
remember
that
,
and
tell
*NL*
me
why
I
should
pity
man
more
than
he
pities
me
?
You
would
not
call
it
*NL*
murder
if
you
could
precipitate
me
into
one
of
those
ice-rifts
and
*NL*
destroy
my
frame
,
the
work
of
your
own
hands
.
Shall
I
respect
man
when
*NL*
he
condemns
me
?
Let
him
live
with
me
in
the
interchange
of
kindness
,
*NL*
and
instead
of
injury
I
would
bestow
every
benefit
upon
him
with
tears
*NL*
of
gratitude
at
his
acceptance
.
But
that
can
not
be
;
the
human
senses
*NL*
are
insurmountable
barriers
to
our
union
.
Yet
mine
shall
not
be
the
*NL*
submission

abject
slavery

I
will
revenge
my
injuries
;
if
I
can
not
*NL*
inspire
love

I
will
cause
fear
,
and
chiefly
towards
you
my
arch-enemy

do
I
swear
inextinguishable
hatred

Have
a
care

will
work
at
your
destruction

nor
finish
until
I
desolate
your
heart
,
*NL*
so
that
you
shall
curse
the
hour
of
your
birth

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fiendish
rage
animated
him
as
he
said
this
;
his
face
was
wrinkled
*NL*
into
contortions
too
horrible
for
human
eyes
to
behold
;
but
presently
*NL*
he
calmed
himself
and
proceeded
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
intended
to
reason
.
This
passion
is
detrimental
to
me
,
for
you
do
*NL*
not
reflect
that
YOU
are
the
cause
of
its
excess
.
If
any
being
felt
*NL*
emotions
of
benevolence
towards
me
,
I
should
return
them
a
hundred
and
*NL*
a
hundredfold
;
for
that
one
creature
's
sake
I
would
make
peace
with
the
*NL*
whole
kind
!
But
I
now
indulge
in
dreams
of
bliss
that
can
not
be
*NL*
realized
.
What
I
ask
of
you
is
reasonable
and
moderate
;
I
demand
a
*NL*
creature
of
another
sex
,
but
as
hideous
as
myself
;
the
gratification
is
*NL*
small
,
but
it
is
all
that
I
can
receive
,
and
it
shall
content
me
.
It
*NL*
is
true
,
we
shall
be
monsters
,
cut
off
from
all
the
world
;
but
on
that
*NL*
account
we
shall
be
more
attached
to
one
another
.
Our
lives
will
not
*NL*
be
happy
,
but
they
will
be
harmless
and
free
from
the
misery
I
now
*NL*
feel
.
Oh
!
My
creator
,
make
me
happy
;
let
me
feel
gratitude
towards
*NL*
you
for
one
benefit

Let
me
see
that
I
excite
the
sympathy
of
some
*NL*
existing
thing
;
do
not
deny
me
my
request
!

*NL*
*NL*
I
was
moved
.
I
shuddered
when
I
thought
of
the
possible
consequences
*NL*
of
my
consent
,
but
I
felt
that
there
was
some
justice
in
his
argument
.
*NL*
His
tale
and
the
feelings
he
now
expressed
proved
him
to
be
a
creature
*NL*
of
fine
sensations
,
and
did
I
not
as
his
maker
owe
him
all
the
portion
*NL*
of
happiness
that
it
was
in
my
power
to
bestow
?
He
saw
my
change
of
*NL*
feeling
and
continued
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
consent
,
neither
you
nor
any
other
human
being
shall
ever
see
*NL*
us
again
;
I
will
go
to
the
vast
wilds
of
South
America

My
food
is
not
*NL*
that
of
man
;
I
do
not
destroy
the
lamb
and
the
kid
to
glut
my
appetite
;
*NL*
acorns
and
berries
afford
me
sufficient
nourishment

My
companion
will
*NL*
be
of
the
same
nature

myself

will
be
content
with
the
same
fare

We
shall
make
our
bed
of
dried
leaves
;
the
sun
will
shine
on
us
as
on

man

will
ripen
our
food

The
picture
I
present
to
you
is
peaceful
*NL*
and
human
,

you
must
feel
that
you
could
deny
it

wantonness

compassion

I
so
ardently
desire

replied
I
,

most

*NL*
His
words
had
a
strange
effect
upon
me
.
I
compassionated
him
and
*NL*
sometimes
felt
a
wish
to
console
him
,
but
when
I
looked
upon
him
,
when
*NL*
I
saw
the
filthy
mass
that
moved
and
talked
,
my
heart
sickened
and
my
*NL*
feelings
were
altered
to
those
of
horror
and
hatred
.
I
tried
to
stifle
*NL*
these
sensations
;
I
thought
that
as
I
could
not
sympathize
with
him
,
I
*NL*
had
no
right
to
withhold
from

the
small
portion

happiness

*NL*
was
yet
in
my
power
to
bestow

*NL*
``
You
swear

I
said
,
``
to

have
you
not
already

degree

malice

should
reasonably
make

May
not
*NL*
even
this
be
a
feint
that
will
increase
your
triumph

affording
a

wider
scope

your
revenge

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
this
?
I
must
not
be
trifled
with
,

I
demand
an
answer

If
*NL*
I
have
no
ties
and
no
affections
,
hatred
and
vice
must
be
my
portion
;
*NL*
the
love
of
another
will
destroy
the
cause
of
my
crimes
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
become
a
thing
of
whose
existence
everyone
will
be
ignorant

My
vices
*NL*
are
the
children
of
a
forced
solitude
that
I
abhor
,
and
my
virtues
will
*NL*
necessarily
arise
when
I
live
in
communion
with
an
equal
.
I
shall
feel
*NL*
the
affections
of
a
sensitive
being
and
become
linked
to
the
chain
of
*NL*
existence
and
events
from
which
I
am
now
excluded

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
paused
some
time
to
reflect
on
all
he
had
related
and
the
various
*NL*
arguments
which
he
had
employed
.
I
thought
of
the
promise
of
virtues
*NL*
which
he
had
displayed
on
the
opening
of
his
existence
and
the
*NL*
subsequent
blight
of
all
kindly
feeling
by
the
loathing
and
scorn
which
*NL*
his
protectors
had
manifested
towards
him
.
His
power
and
threats
were
*NL*
not
omitted
in
my
calculations
;
a
creature
who
could
exist
in
the
ice
*NL*
caves
of
the
glaciers
and
hide
himself
from
pursuit
among
the
ridges
of
*NL*
inaccessible
precipices
was
a
being
possessing
faculties
it
would
be
*NL*
vain
to
cope
with
.
After
a
long
pause
of
reflection
I
concluded
that
*NL*
the
justice
due
both
to
him
and
my
fellow
creatures
demanded
of
me
that
*NL*
I
should
comply
with
his
request
.
Turning
to
him
,
therefore
,
I
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consent
to
your
demand

on
your
solemn

quit
Europe
forever

the
neighbourhood
of

as
soon
as
I
shall
*NL*
deliver
into
your
hands
a
female
who
will
accompany
you
in
your
exile

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear

he
cried
,
``

the
sun

fire

my
heart

that
if

grant
my
prayer

*NL*
while
they
exist
you
shall
never
behold
me
again
.
Depart
to
your
home
*NL*
and
commence
your
labours
;
I
shall
watch
their
progress
with
*NL*
unutterable
anxiety
;
and
fear
not
but
that
when
you
are
ready
I
shall
*NL*
appear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Saying
this
,
he
suddenly
quitted
me
,
fearful
,
perhaps
,
of
any
change
in
*NL*
my
sentiments
.
I
saw
him
descend
the
mountain
with
greater
speed
than
*NL*
the
flight
of
an
eagle
,
and
quickly
lost
among
the
undulations
of
the
*NL*
sea
of
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tale
had
occupied
the
whole
day
,
and
the
sun
was
upon
the
verge
of
*NL*
the
horizon
when
he
departed
.
I
knew
that
I
ought
to
hasten
my
descent
*NL*
towards
the
valley
,
as
I
should
soon
be
encompassed
in
darkness
;
but
my
*NL*
heart
was
heavy
,
and
my
steps
slow
.
The
labour
of
winding
among
the
*NL*
little
paths
of
the
mountain
and
fixing
my
feet
firmly
as
I
advanced
*NL*
perplexed
me
,
occupied
as
I
was
by
the
emotions
which
the
occurrences
*NL*
of
the
day
had
produced
.
Night
was
far
advanced
when
I
came
to
the
*NL*
halfway
resting-place
and
seated
myself
beside
the
fountain
.
The
stars
*NL*
shone
at
intervals
as
the
clouds
passed
from
over
them
;
the
dark
pines
*NL*
rose
before
me
,
and
every
here
and
there
a
broken
tree
lay
on
the
*NL*
ground
;
it
was
a
scene
of
wonderful
solemnity
and
stirred
strange
*NL*
thoughts
within
me
.
I
wept
bitterly
,
and
clasping
my
hands
in
agony
,
I
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Oh
!
Stars
and
clouds
and
winds
,
ye
are
all
about
to
mock
*NL*
me
;
if
ye
really
pity
me
,
crush
sensation
and
memory
;
let
me
become
as
*NL*
nought
;
but
if
not
,
depart
,
depart
,
and
leave
me
in
darkness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
wild
and
miserable
thoughts
,
but
I
can
not
describe
to
you
*NL*
how
the
eternal
twinkling
of
the
stars
weighed
upon
me
and
how
I
*NL*
listened
to
every
blast
of
wind
as
if
it
were
a
dull
ugly
siroc
on
its
*NL*
way
to
consume
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
dawned
before
I
arrived
at
the
village
of
Chamounix
;
I
took
no
*NL*
rest
,
but
returned
immediately
to
Geneva
.
Even
in
my
own
heart
I
could
*NL*
give
no
expression
to
my
sensations
--
they
weighed
on
me
with
a
*NL*
mountain
's
weight
and
their
excess
destroyed
my
agony
beneath
them
.
*NL*
Thus
I
returned
home
,
and
entering
the
house
,
presented
myself
to
the
*NL*
family
.
My
haggard
and
wild
appearance
awoke
intense
alarm
,
but
I
*NL*
answered
no
question
,
scarcely
did
I
speak
.
I
felt
as
if
I
were
placed
*NL*
under
a
ban
--
as
if
I
had
no
right
to
claim
their
sympathies
--
as
if
*NL*
never
more
might
I
enjoy
companionship
with
them
.
Yet
even
thus
I
*NL*
loved
them
to
adoration
;
and
to
save
them
,
I
resolved
to
dedicate
*NL*
myself
to
my
most
abhorred
task
.
The
prospect
of
such
an
occupation
*NL*
made
every
other
circumstance
of
existence
pass
before
me
like
a
dream
,
*NL*
and
that
thought
only
had
to
me
the
reality
of
life
.

Chapter
18
*NL*
*NL*
Day
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
passed
away
on
my
return
to
Geneva
;
and
*NL*
I
could
not
collect
the
courage
to
recommence
my
work
.
I
feared
the
*NL*
vengeance
of
the
disappointed
fiend
,
yet
I
was
unable
to
overcome
my
*NL*
repugnance
to
the
task
which
was
enjoined
me
.
I
found
that
I
could
not
*NL*
compose
a
female
without
again
devoting
several
months
to
profound
*NL*
study
and
laborious
disquisition
.
I
had
heard
of
some
discoveries
*NL*
having
been
made
by
an
English
philosopher
,
the
knowledge
of
which
was
*NL*
material
to
my
success
,
and
I
sometimes
thought
of
obtaining
my
*NL*
father
's
consent
to
visit
England
for
this
purpose
;
but
I
clung
to
*NL*
every
pretence
of
delay
and
shrank
from
taking
the
first
step
in
an
*NL*
undertaking
whose
immediate
necessity
began
to
appear
less
absolute
to
*NL*
me
.
A
change
indeed
had
taken
place
in
me
;
my
health
,
which
had
*NL*
hitherto
declined
,
was
now
much
restored
;
and
my
spirits
,
when
*NL*
unchecked
by
the
memory
of
my
unhappy
promise
,
rose
proportionably
.
My
*NL*
father
saw
this
change
with
pleasure
,
and
he
turned
his
thoughts
*NL*
towards
the
best
method
of
eradicating
the
remains
of
my
melancholy
,
*NL*
which
every
now
and
then
would
return
by
fits
,
and
with
a
devouring
*NL*
blackness
overcast
the
approaching
sunshine
.
At
these
moments
I
took
*NL*
refuge
in
the
most
perfect
solitude
.
I
passed
whole
days
on
the
lake
*NL*
alone
in
a
little
boat
,
watching
the
clouds
and
listening
to
the
*NL*
rippling
of
the
waves
,
silent
and
listless
.
But
the
fresh
air
and
*NL*
bright
sun
seldom
failed
to
restore
me
to
some
degree
of
composure
,
and
*NL*
on
my
return
I
met
the
salutations
of
my
friends
with
a
readier
smile
*NL*
and
a
more
cheerful
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
my
return
from
one
of
these
rambles
that
my
father
,
*NL*
calling
me
aside
,
thus
addressed
me
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
happy
to
remark
,
my
dear
son
,
that
you
have
resumed
your
former
*NL*
pleasures
and
seem
to
be
returning
to
yourself
.
And
yet
you
are
still
*NL*
unhappy
and
still
avoid
our
society
.
For
some
time
I
was
lost
in
*NL*
conjecture
as
to
the
cause
of
this
,
but
yesterday
an
idea
struck
me
,
*NL*
and
if
it
is
well
founded
,
I
conjure
you
to
avow
it
.
Reserve
on
such
a
*NL*
point
would
be
not
only
useless
,
but
draw
down
treble
misery
on
us
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
violently
at
his
exordium
,
and
my
father
continued
--
``
I
*NL*
confess
,
my
son
,
that
I
have
always
looked
forward
to
your
marriage
*NL*
with
our
dear
Elizabeth
as
the
tie
of
our
domestic
comfort
and
the
stay
*NL*
of
my
declining
years
.
You
were
attached
to
each
other
from
your
*NL*
earliest
infancy
;
you
studied
together
,
and
appeared
,
in
dispositions
*NL*
and
tastes
,
entirely
suited
to
one
another
.
But
so
blind
is
the
*NL*
experience
of
man
that
what
I
conceived
to
be
the
best
assistants
to
my
*NL*
plan
may
have
entirely
destroyed
it
.
You
,
perhaps
,
regard
her
as
your
*NL*
sister
,
without
any
wish
that
she
might
become
your
wife
.
Nay
,
you
may
*NL*
have
met
with
another
whom
you
may
love
;
and
considering
yourself
as
*NL*
bound
in
honour
to
Elizabeth
,
this
struggle
may
occasion
the
poignant
*NL*
misery
which
you
appear
to
feel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
father
,
reassure
yourself
.
I
love
my
cousin
tenderly
and
*NL*
sincerely
.
I
never
saw
any
woman
who
excited
,
as
Elizabeth
does
,
my
*NL*
warmest
admiration
and
affection
.
My
future
hopes
and
prospects
are
*NL*
entirely
bound
up
in
the
expectation
of
our
union
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
expression
of
your
sentiments
of
this
subject
,
my
dear
Victor
,
*NL*
gives
me
more
pleasure
than
I
have
for
some
time
experienced
.
If
you
*NL*
feel
thus
,
we
shall
assuredly
be
happy
,
however
present
events
may
cast
*NL*
a
gloom
over
us
.
But
it
is
this
gloom
which
appears
to
have
taken
so
*NL*
strong
a
hold
of
your
mind
that
I
wish
to
dissipate
.
Tell
me
,
*NL*
therefore
,
whether
you
object
to
an
immediate
solemnization
of
the
*NL*
marriage
.
We
have
been
unfortunate
,
and
recent
events
have
drawn
us
*NL*
from
that
everyday
tranquillity
befitting
my
years
and
infirmities
.
You
*NL*
are
younger
;
yet
I
do
not
suppose
,
possessed
as
you
are
of
a
competent
*NL*
fortune
,
that
an
early
marriage
would
at
all
interfere
with
any
future
*NL*
plans
of
honour
and
utility
that
you
may
have
formed
.
Do
not
suppose
,
*NL*
however
,
that
I
wish
to
dictate
happiness
to
you
or
that
a
delay
on
*NL*
your
part
would
cause
me
any
serious
uneasiness
.
Interpret
my
words
*NL*
with
candour
and
answer
me
,
I
conjure
you
,
with
confidence
and
*NL*
sincerity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
listened
to
my
father
in
silence
and
remained
for
some
time
incapable
*NL*
of
offering
any
reply
.
I
revolved
rapidly
in
my
mind
a
multitude
of
*NL*
thoughts
and
endeavoured
to
arrive
at
some
conclusion
.
Alas
!
To
me
*NL*
the
idea
of
an
immediate
union
with
my
Elizabeth
was
one
of
horror
and
*NL*
dismay
.
I
was
bound
by
a
solemn
promise
which
I
had
not
yet
fulfilled
*NL*
and
dared
not
break
,
or
if
I
did
,
what
manifold
miseries
might
not
*NL*
impend
over
me
and
my
devoted
family
!
Could
I
enter
into
a
festival
*NL*
with
this
deadly
weight
yet
hanging
round
my
neck
and
bowing
me
to
the
*NL*
ground
?
I
must
perform
my
engagement
and
let
the
monster
depart
with
*NL*
his
mate
before
I
allowed
myself
to
enjoy
the
delight
of
a
union
from
*NL*
which
I
expected
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remembered
also
the
necessity
imposed
upon
me
of
either
journeying
to
*NL*
England
or
entering
into
a
long
correspondence
with
those
philosophers
*NL*
of
that
country
whose
knowledge
and
discoveries
were
of
indispensable
*NL*
use
to
me
in
my
present
undertaking
.
The
latter
method
of
obtaining
*NL*
the
desired
intelligence
was
dilatory
and
unsatisfactory
;
besides
,
I
*NL*
had
an
insurmountable
aversion
to
the
idea
of
engaging
myself
in
my
*NL*
loathsome
task
in
my
father
's
house
while
in
habits
of
familiar
*NL*
intercourse
with
those
I
loved
.
I
knew
that
a
thousand
fearful
*NL*
accidents
might
occur
,
the
slightest
of
which
would
disclose
a
tale
to
*NL*
thrill
all
connected
with
me
with
horror
.
I
was
aware
also
that
I
*NL*
should
often
lose
all
self-command
,
all
capacity
of
hiding
the
*NL*
harrowing
sensations
that
would
possess
me
during
the
progress
of
my
*NL*
unearthly
occupation
.
I
must
absent
myself
from
all
I
loved
while
thus
*NL*
employed
.
Once
commenced
,
it
would
quickly
be
achieved
,
and
I
might
be
*NL*
restored
to
my
family
in
peace
and
happiness
.
My
promise
fulfilled
,
*NL*
the
monster
would
depart
forever
.
Or
-LRB-
so
my
fond
fancy
imaged
-RRB-
some
*NL*
accident
might
meanwhile
occur
to
destroy
him
and
put
an
end
to
my
*NL*
slavery
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
feelings
dictated
my
answer
to
my
father
.
I
expressed
a
wish
to
*NL*
visit
England
,
but
concealing
the
true
reasons
of
this
request
,
I
*NL*
clothed
my
desires
under
a
guise
which
excited
no
suspicion
,
while
I
*NL*
urged
my
desire
with
an
earnestness
that
easily
induced
my
father
to
*NL*
comply
.
After
so
long
a
period
of
an
absorbing
melancholy
that
*NL*
resembled
madness
in
its
intensity
and
effects
,
he
was
glad
to
find
*NL*
that
I
was
capable
of
taking
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
such
a
journey
,
*NL*
and
he
hoped
that
change
of
scene
and
varied
amusement
would
,
before
my
*NL*
return
,
have
restored
me
entirely
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duration
of
my
absence
was
left
to
my
own
choice
;
a
few
months
,
or
*NL*
at
most
a
year
,
was
the
period
contemplated
.
One
paternal
kind
*NL*
precaution
he
had
taken
to
ensure
my
having
a
companion
.
Without
*NL*
previously
communicating
with
me
,
he
had
,
in
concert
with
Elizabeth
,
*NL*
arranged
that
Clerval
should
join
me
at
Strasbourg
.
This
interfered
*NL*
with
the
solitude
I
coveted
for
the
prosecution
of
my
task
;
yet
at
the
*NL*
commencement
of
my
journey
the
presence
of
my
friend
could
in
no
way
be
*NL*
an
impediment
,
and
truly
I
rejoiced
that
thus
I
should
be
saved
many
*NL*
hours
of
lonely
,
maddening
reflection
.
Nay
,
Henry
might
stand
between
*NL*
me
and
the
intrusion
of
my
foe
.
If
I
were
alone
,
would
he
not
at
times
*NL*
force
his
abhorred
presence
on
me
to
remind
me
of
my
task
or
to
*NL*
contemplate
its
progress
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
England
,
therefore
,
I
was
bound
,
and
it
was
understood
that
my
union
*NL*
with
Elizabeth
should
take
place
immediately
on
my
return
.
My
father
's
*NL*
age
rendered
him
extremely
averse
to
delay
.
For
myself
,
there
was
one
*NL*
reward
I
promised
myself
from
my
detested
toils
--
one
consolation
for
my
*NL*
unparalleled
sufferings
;
it
was
the
prospect
of
that
day
when
,
*NL*
enfranchised
from
my
miserable
slavery
,
I
might
claim
Elizabeth
and
*NL*
forget
the
past
in
my
union
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
made
arrangements
for
my
journey
,
but
one
feeling
haunted
me
*NL*
which
filled
me
with
fear
and
agitation
.
During
my
absence
I
should
*NL*
leave
my
friends
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
their
enemy
and
*NL*
unprotected
from
his
attacks
,
exasperated
as
he
might
be
by
my
*NL*
departure
.
But
he
had
promised
to
follow
me
wherever
I
might
go
,
and
*NL*
would
he
not
accompany
me
to
England
?
This
imagination
was
dreadful
in
*NL*
itself
,
but
soothing
inasmuch
as
it
supposed
the
safety
of
my
friends
.
*NL*
I
was
agonized
with
the
idea
of
the
possibility
that
the
reverse
of
*NL*
this
might
happen
.
But
through
the
whole
period
during
which
I
was
the
*NL*
slave
of
my
creature
I
allowed
myself
to
be
governed
by
the
impulses
of
*NL*
the
moment
;
and
my
present
sensations
strongly
intimated
that
the
fiend
*NL*
would
follow
me
and
exempt
my
family
from
the
danger
of
his
*NL*
machinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
latter
end
of
September
that
I
again
quitted
my
native
*NL*
country
.
My
journey
had
been
my
own
suggestion
,
and
Elizabeth
*NL*
therefore
acquiesced
,
but
she
was
filled
with
disquiet
at
the
idea
of
*NL*
my
suffering
,
away
from
her
,
the
inroads
of
misery
and
grief
.
It
had
*NL*
been
her
care
which
provided
me
a
companion
in
Clerval
--
and
yet
a
man
*NL*
is
blind
to
a
thousand
minute
circumstances
which
call
forth
a
woman
's
*NL*
sedulous
attention
.
She
longed
to
bid
me
hasten
my
return
;
a
thousand
*NL*
conflicting
emotions
rendered
her
mute
as
she
bade
me
a
tearful
,
silent
*NL*
farewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
threw
myself
into
the
carriage
that
was
to
convey
me
away
,
hardly
*NL*
knowing
whither
I
was
going
,
and
careless
of
what
was
passing
around
.
*NL*
I
remembered
only
,
and
it
was
with
a
bitter
anguish
that
I
reflected
on
*NL*
it
,
to
order
that
my
chemical
instruments
should
be
packed
to
go
with
*NL*
me
.
Filled
with
dreary
imaginations
,
I
passed
through
many
beautiful
*NL*
and
majestic
scenes
,
but
my
eyes
were
fixed
and
unobserving
.
I
could
*NL*
only
think
of
the
bourne
of
my
travels
and
the
work
which
was
to
occupy
*NL*
me
whilst
they
endured
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
days
spent
in
listless
indolence
,
during
which
I
traversed
*NL*
many
leagues
,
I
arrived
at
Strasbourg
,
where
I
waited
two
days
for
*NL*
Clerval
.
He
came
.
Alas
,
how
great
was
the
contrast
between
us
!
He
*NL*
was
alive
to
every
new
scene
,
joyful
when
he
saw
the
beauties
of
the
*NL*
setting
sun
,
and
more
happy
when
he
beheld
it
rise
and
recommence
a
new
*NL*
day
.
He
pointed
out
to
me
the
shifting
colours
of
the
landscape
and
*NL*
the
appearances
of
the
sky
.
``
This
is
what
it
is
to
live
,
''
he
cried
;
*NL*
``
how
I
enjoy
existence
!
But
you
,
my
dear
Frankenstein
,
wherefore
are
*NL*
you
desponding
and
sorrowful
!
''
In
truth
,
I
was
occupied
by
gloomy
*NL*
thoughts
and
neither
saw
the
descent
of
the
evening
star
nor
the
golden
*NL*
sunrise
reflected
in
the
Rhine
.
And
you
,
my
friend
,
would
be
far
more
*NL*
amused
with
the
journal
of
Clerval
,
who
observed
the
scenery
with
an
*NL*
eye
of
feeling
and
delight
,
than
in
listening
to
my
reflections
.
I
,
a
*NL*
miserable
wretch
,
haunted
by
a
curse
that
shut
up
every
avenue
to
*NL*
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
agreed
to
descend
the
Rhine
in
a
boat
from
Strasbourg
to
*NL*
Rotterdam
,
whence
we
might
take
shipping
for
London
.
During
this
*NL*
voyage
we
passed
many
willowy
islands
and
saw
several
beautiful
towns
.
*NL*
We
stayed
a
day
at
Mannheim
,
and
on
the
fifth
from
our
departure
from
*NL*
Strasbourg
,
arrived
at
Mainz
.
The
course
of
the
Rhine
below
Mainz
*NL*
becomes
much
more
picturesque
.
The
river
descends
rapidly
and
winds
*NL*
between
hills
,
not
high
,
but
steep
,
and
of
beautiful
forms
.
We
saw
*NL*
many
ruined
castles
standing
on
the
edges
of
precipices
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
black
woods
,
high
and
inaccessible
.
This
part
of
the
Rhine
,
indeed
,
*NL*
presents
a
singularly
variegated
landscape
.
In
one
spot
you
view
*NL*
rugged
hills
,
ruined
castles
overlooking
tremendous
precipices
,
with
*NL*
the
dark
Rhine
rushing
beneath
;
and
on
the
sudden
turn
of
a
promontory
,
*NL*
flourishing
vineyards
with
green
sloping
banks
and
a
meandering
river
*NL*
and
populous
towns
occupy
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
travelled
at
the
time
of
the
vintage
and
heard
the
song
of
the
*NL*
labourers
as
we
glided
down
the
stream
.
Even
I
,
depressed
in
mind
,
and
*NL*
my
spirits
continually
agitated
by
gloomy
feelings
,
even
I
was
pleased
.
*NL*
I
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
as
I
gazed
on
the
cloudless
blue
*NL*
sky
,
I
seemed
to
drink
in
a
tranquillity
to
which
I
had
long
been
a
*NL*
stranger
.
And
if
these
were
my
sensations
,
who
can
describe
those
of
*NL*
Henry
?
He
felt
as
if
he
had
been
transported
to
fairy-land
and
enjoyed
*NL*
a
happiness
seldom
tasted
by
man
.
``
I
have
seen
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
most
*NL*
beautiful
scenes
of
my
own
country
;
I
have
visited
the
lakes
of
Lucerne
*NL*
and
Uri
,
where
the
snowy
mountains
descend
almost
perpendicularly
to
*NL*
the
water
,
casting
black
and
impenetrable
shades
,
which
would
cause
a
*NL*
gloomy
and
mournful
appearance
were
it
not
for
the
most
verdant
islands
*NL*
that
believe
the
eye
by
their
gay
appearance
;
I
have
seen
this
lake
*NL*
agitated
by
a
tempest
,
when
the
wind
tore
up
whirlwinds
of
water
and
*NL*
gave
you
an
idea
of
what
the
water-spout
must
be
on
the
great
ocean
;
*NL*
and
the
waves
dash
with
fury
the
base
of
the
mountain
,
where
the
priest
*NL*
and
his
mistress
were
overwhelmed
by
an
avalanche
and
where
their
dying
*NL*
voices
are
still
said
to
be
heard
amid
the
pauses
of
the
nightly
wind
;
*NL*
I
have
seen
the
mountains
of
La
Valais
,
and
the
Pays
de
Vaud
;
but
this
*NL*
country
,
Victor
,
pleases
me
more
than
all
those
wonders
.
The
mountains
*NL*
of
Switzerland
are
more
majestic
and
strange
,
but
there
is
a
charm
in
*NL*
the
banks
of
this
divine
river
that
I
never
before
saw
equalled
.
Look
*NL*
at
that
castle
which
overhangs
yon
precipice
;
and
that
also
on
the
*NL*
island
,
almost
concealed
amongst
the
foliage
of
those
lovely
trees
;
and
*NL*
now
that
group
of
labourers
coming
from
among
their
vines
;
and
that
*NL*
village
half
hid
in
the
recess
of
the
mountain
.
Oh
,
surely
the
spirit
*NL*
that
inhabits
and
guards
this
place
has
a
soul
more
in
harmony
with
man
*NL*
than
those
who
pile
the
glacier
or
retire
to
the
inaccessible
peaks
of
*NL*
the
mountains
of
our
own
country
.
''
Clerval
!
Beloved
friend
!
Even
now
*NL*
it
delights
me
to
record
your
words
and
to
dwell
on
the
praise
of
which
*NL*
you
are
so
eminently
deserving
.
He
was
a
being
formed
in
the
``
very
*NL*
poetry
of
nature
.
''
His
wild
and
enthusiastic
imagination
was
chastened
*NL*
by
the
sensibility
of
his
heart
.
His
soul
overflowed
with
ardent
*NL*
affections
,
and
his
friendship
was
of
that
devoted
and
wondrous
nature
*NL*
that
the
world-minded
teach
us
to
look
for
only
in
the
imagination
.
But
*NL*
even
human
sympathies
were
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
his
eager
mind
.
*NL*
The
scenery
of
external
nature
,
which
others
regard
only
with
*NL*
admiration
,
he
loved
with
ardour
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
sounding
cataract
*NL*
Haunted
him
like
a
passion
:
the
tall
rock
,
*NL*
The
mountain
,
and
the
deep
and
gloomy
wood
,
*NL*
Their
colours
and
their
forms
,
were
then
to
him
*NL*
An
appetite
;
a
feeling
,
and
a
love
,
*NL*
That
had
no
need
of
a
remoter
charm
,
*NL*
By
thought
supplied
,
or
any
interest
*NL*
Unborrow

*NL*
*NL*
And
where
does
he
now
exist
?
Is
this
gentle
and
lovely
being
lost
*NL*
forever
?
Has
this
mind
,
so
replete
with
ideas
,
imaginations
fanciful
*NL*
and
magnificent
,
which
formed
a
world
,
whose
existence
depended
on
the
*NL*
life
of
its
creator
;
--
has
this
mind
perished
?
Does
it
now
only
exist
*NL*
in
my
memory
?
No
,
it
is
not
thus
;
your
form
so
divinely
wrought
,
and
*NL*
beaming
with
beauty
,
has
decayed
,
but
your
spirit
still
visits
and
*NL*
consoles
your
unhappy
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pardon
this
gush
of
sorrow
;
these
ineffectual
words
are
but
a
slight
*NL*
tribute
to
the
unexampled
worth
of
Henry
,
but
they
soothe
my
heart
,
*NL*
overflowing
with
the
anguish
which
his
remembrance
creates
.
I
will
*NL*
proceed
with
my
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
Cologne
we
descended
to
the
plains
of
Holland
;
and
we
resolved
*NL*
to
post
the
remainder
of
our
way
,
for
the
wind
was
contrary
and
the
*NL*
stream
of
the
river
was
too
gentle
to
aid
us
.
Our
journey
here
lost
*NL*
the
interest
arising
from
beautiful
scenery
,
but
we
arrived
in
a
few
*NL*
days
at
Rotterdam
,
whence
we
proceeded
by
sea
to
England
.
It
was
on
a
*NL*
clear
morning
,
in
the
latter
days
of
December
,
that
I
first
saw
the
*NL*
white
cliffs
of
Britain
.
The
banks
of
the
Thames
presented
a
new
*NL*
scene
;
they
were
flat
but
fertile
,
and
almost
every
town
was
marked
by
*NL*
the
remembrance
of
some
story
.
We
saw
Tilbury
Fort
and
remembered
the
*NL*
Spanish
Armada
,
Gravesend
,
Woolwich
,
and
Greenwich
--
places
which
I
had
*NL*
heard
of
even
in
my
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
we
saw
the
numerous
steeples
of
London
,
St.
Paul
's
towering
*NL*
above
all
,
and
the
Tower
famed
in
English
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
London
was
our
present
point
of
rest
;
we
determined
to
remain
several
*NL*
months
in
this
wonderful
and
celebrated
city
.
Clerval
desired
the
*NL*
intercourse
of
the
men
of
genius
and
talent
who
flourished
at
this
*NL*
time
,
but
this
was
with
me
a
secondary
object
;
I
was
principally
*NL*
occupied
with
the
means
of
obtaining
the
information
necessary
for
the
*NL*
completion
of
my
promise
and
quickly
availed
myself
of
the
letters
of
*NL*
introduction
that
I
had
brought
with
me
,
addressed
to
the
most
*NL*
distinguished
natural
philosophers
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
this
journey
had
taken
place
during
my
days
of
study
and
happiness
,
*NL*
it
would
have
afforded
me
inexpressible
pleasure
.
But
a
blight
had
*NL*
come
over
my
existence
,
and
I
only
visited
these
people
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
the
information
they
might
give
me
on
the
subject
in
which
my
interest
*NL*
was
so
terribly
profound
.
Company
was
irksome
to
me
;
when
alone
,
I
*NL*
could
fill
my
mind
with
the
sights
of
heaven
and
earth
;
the
voice
of
*NL*
Henry
soothed
me
,
and
I
could
thus
cheat
myself
into
a
transitory
*NL*
peace
.
But
busy
,
uninteresting
,
joyous
faces
brought
back
despair
to
*NL*
my
heart
.
I
saw
an
insurmountable
barrier
placed
between
me
and
my
*NL*
fellow
men
;
this
barrier
was
sealed
with
the
blood
of
William
and
*NL*
Justine
,
and
to
reflect
on
the
events
connected
with
those
names
filled
*NL*
my
soul
with
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
Clerval
I
saw
the
image
of
my
former
self
;
he
was
inquisitive
*NL*
and
anxious
to
gain
experience
and
instruction
.
The
difference
of
*NL*
manners
which
he
observed
was
to
him
an
inexhaustible
source
of
*NL*
instruction
and
amusement
.
He
was
also
pursuing
an
object
he
had
long
*NL*
had
in
view
.
His
design
was
to
visit
India
,
in
the
belief
that
he
had
*NL*
in
his
knowledge
of
its
various
languages
,
and
in
the
views
he
had
*NL*
taken
of
its
society
,
the
means
of
materially
assisting
the
progress
of
*NL*
European
colonization
and
trade
.
In
Britain
only
could
he
further
the
*NL*
execution
of
his
plan
.
He
was
forever
busy
,
and
the
only
check
to
his
*NL*
enjoyments
was
my
sorrowful
and
dejected
mind
.
I
tried
to
conceal
this
*NL*
as
much
as
possible
,
that
I
might
not
debar
him
from
the
pleasures
*NL*
natural
to
one
who
was
entering
on
a
new
scene
of
life
,
undisturbed
by
*NL*
any
care
or
bitter
recollection
.
I
often
refused
to
accompany
him
,
*NL*
alleging
another
engagement
,
that
I
might
remain
alone
.
I
now
also
*NL*
began
to
collect
the
materials
necessary
for
my
new
creation
,
and
this
*NL*
was
to
me
like
the
torture
of
single
drops
of
water
continually
falling
*NL*
on
the
head
.
Every
thought
that
was
devoted
to
it
was
an
extreme
*NL*
anguish
,
and
every
word
that
I
spoke
in
allusion
to
it
caused
my
lips
*NL*
to
quiver
,
and
my
heart
to
palpitate
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
passing
some
months
in
London
,
we
received
a
letter
from
a
person
*NL*
in
Scotland
who
had
formerly
been
our
visitor
at
Geneva
.
He
mentioned
*NL*
the
beauties
of
his
native
country
and
asked
us
if
those
were
not
*NL*
sufficient
allurements
to
induce
us
to
prolong
our
journey
as
far
north
*NL*
as
Perth
,
where
he
resided
.
Clerval
eagerly
desired
to
accept
this
*NL*
invitation
,
and
I
,
although
I
abhorred
society
,
wished
to
view
again
*NL*
mountains
and
streams
and
all
the
wondrous
works
with
which
Nature
*NL*
adorns
her
chosen
dwelling-places
.
We
had
arrived
in
England
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
October
,
and
it
was
now
February
.
We
accordingly
*NL*
determined
to
commence
our
journey
towards
the
north
at
the
expiration
*NL*
of
another
month
.
In
this
expedition
we
did
not
intend
to
follow
the
*NL*
great
road
to
Edinburgh
,
but
to
visit
Windsor
,
Oxford
,
Matlock
,
and
the
*NL*
Cumberland
lakes
,
resolving
to
arrive
at
the
completion
of
this
tour
*NL*
about
the
end
of
July
.
I
packed
up
my
chemical
instruments
and
the
*NL*
materials
I
had
collected
,
resolving
to
finish
my
labours
in
some
*NL*
obscure
nook
in
the
northern
highlands
of
Scotland
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
quitted
London
on
the
27th
of
March
and
remained
a
few
days
at
*NL*
Windsor
,
rambling
in
its
beautiful
forest
.
This
was
a
new
scene
to
us
*NL*
mountaineers
;
the
majestic
oaks
,
the
quantity
of
game
,
and
the
herds
of
*NL*
stately
deer
were
all
novelties
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
thence
we
proceeded
to
Oxford
.
As
we
entered
this
city
our
minds
*NL*
were
filled
with
the
remembrance
of
the
events
that
had
been
transacted
*NL*
there
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
before
.
It
was
here
that
Charles
*NL*
I.
had
collected
his
forces
.
This
city
had
remained
faithful
to
him
,
*NL*
after
the
whole
nation
had
forsaken
his
cause
to
join
the
standard
of
*NL*
Parliament
and
liberty
.
The
memory
of
that
unfortunate
king
and
his
*NL*
companions
,
the
amiable
Falkland
,
the
insolent
Goring
,
his
queen
,
and
*NL*
son
,
gave
a
peculiar
interest
to
every
part
of
the
city
which
they
*NL*
might
be
supposed
to
have
inhabited
.
The
spirit
of
elder
days
found
a
*NL*
dwelling
here
,
and
we
delighted
to
trace
its
footsteps
.
If
these
*NL*
feelings
had
not
found
an
imaginary
gratification
,
the
appearance
of
*NL*
the
city
had
yet
in
itself
sufficient
beauty
to
obtain
our
admiration
.
*NL*
The
colleges
are
ancient
and
picturesque
;
the
streets
are
almost
*NL*
magnificent
;
and
the
lovely
Isis
,
which
flows
beside
it
through
meadows
*NL*
of
exquisite
verdure
,
is
spread
forth
into
a
placid
expanse
of
waters
,
*NL*
which
reflects
its
majestic
assemblage
of
towers
,
and
spires
,
and
*NL*
domes
,
embosomed
among
aged
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
enjoyed
this
scene
,
and
yet
my
enjoyment
was
embittered
both
by
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
past
and
the
anticipation
of
the
future
.
I
was
formed
*NL*
for
peaceful
happiness
.
During
my
youthful
days
discontent
never
*NL*
visited
my
mind
,
and
if
I
was
ever
overcome
by
ennui
,
the
sight
of
what
*NL*
is
beautiful
in
nature
or
the
study
of
what
is
excellent
and
sublime
in
*NL*
the
productions
of
man
could
always
interest
my
heart
and
communicate
*NL*
elasticity
to
my
spirits
.
But
I
am
a
blasted
tree
;
the
bolt
has
*NL*
entered
my
soul
;
and
I
felt
then
that
I
should
survive
to
exhibit
what
*NL*
I
shall
soon
cease
to
be
--
a
miserable
spectacle
of
wrecked
humanity
,
*NL*
pitiable
to
others
and
intolerable
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
passed
a
considerable
period
at
Oxford
,
rambling
among
its
environs
*NL*
and
endeavouring
to
identify
every
spot
which
might
relate
to
the
most
*NL*
animating
epoch
of
English
history
.
Our
little
voyages
of
discovery
*NL*
were
often
prolonged
by
the
successive
objects
that
presented
*NL*
themselves
.
We
visited
the
tomb
of
the
illustrious
Hampden
and
the
*NL*
field
on
which
that
patriot
fell
.
For
a
moment
my
soul
was
elevated
*NL*
from
its
debasing
and
miserable
fears
to
contemplate
the
divine
ideas
*NL*
of
liberty
and
self
sacrifice
of
which
these
sights
were
the
monuments
*NL*
and
the
remembrancers
.
For
an
instant
I
dared
to
shake
off
my
chains
*NL*
and
look
around
me
with
a
free
and
lofty
spirit
,
but
the
iron
had
eaten
*NL*
into
my
flesh
,
and
I
sank
again
,
trembling
and
hopeless
,
into
my
*NL*
miserable
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
Oxford
with
regret
and
proceeded
to
Matlock
,
which
was
our
next
*NL*
place
of
rest
.
The
country
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
village
*NL*
resembled
,
to
a
greater
degree
,
the
scenery
of
Switzerland
;
but
*NL*
everything
is
on
a
lower
scale
,
and
the
green
hills
want
the
crown
of
*NL*
distant
white
Alps
which
always
attend
on
the
piny
mountains
of
my
*NL*
native
country
.
We
visited
the
wondrous
cave
and
the
little
cabinets
*NL*
of
natural
history
,
where
the
curiosities
are
disposed
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
as
in
the
collections
at
Servox
and
Chamounix
.
The
latter
name
*NL*
made
me
tremble
when
pronounced
by
Henry
,
and
I
hastened
to
quit
*NL*
Matlock
,
with
which
that
terrible
scene
was
thus
associated
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Derby
,
still
journeying
northwards
,
we
passed
two
months
in
*NL*
Cumberland
and
Westmorland
.
I
could
now
almost
fancy
myself
among
the
*NL*
Swiss
mountains
.
The
little
patches
of
snow
which
yet
lingered
on
the
*NL*
northern
sides
of
the
mountains
,
the
lakes
,
and
the
dashing
of
the
*NL*
rocky
streams
were
all
familiar
and
dear
sights
to
me
.
Here
also
we
*NL*
made
some
acquaintances
,
who
almost
contrived
to
cheat
me
into
*NL*
happiness
.
The
delight
of
Clerval
was
proportionably
greater
than
*NL*
mine
;
his
mind
expanded
in
the
company
of
men
of
talent
,
and
he
found
*NL*
in
his
own
nature
greater
capacities
and
resources
than
he
could
have
*NL*
imagined
himself
to
have
possessed
while
he
associated
with
his
*NL*
inferiors
.
``
I
could
pass
my
life
here
,
''
said
he
to
me
;
``
and
among
*NL*
these
mountains
I
should
scarcely
regret
Switzerland
and
the
Rhine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
found
that
a
traveller
's
life
is
one
that
includes
much
pain
*NL*
amidst
its
enjoyments
.
His
feelings
are
forever
on
the
stretch
;
and
*NL*
when
he
begins
to
sink
into
repose
,
he
finds
himself
obliged
to
quit
*NL*
that
on
which
he
rests
in
pleasure
for
something
new
,
which
again
*NL*
engages
his
attention
,
and
which
also
he
forsakes
for
other
novelties
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
scarcely
visited
the
various
lakes
of
Cumberland
and
Westmorland
*NL*
and
conceived
an
affection
for
some
of
the
inhabitants
when
the
period
*NL*
of
our
appointment
with
our
Scotch
friend
approached
,
and
we
left
them
*NL*
to
travel
on
.
For
my
own
part
I
was
not
sorry
.
I
had
now
neglected
my
*NL*
promise
for
some
time
,
and
I
feared
the
effects
of
the
daemon
's
*NL*
disappointment
.
He
might
remain
in
Switzerland
and
wreak
his
vengeance
*NL*
on
my
relatives
.
This
idea
pursued
me
and
tormented
me
at
every
moment
*NL*
from
which
I
might
otherwise
have
snatched
repose
and
peace
.
I
waited
*NL*
for
my
letters
with
feverish
impatience
;
if
they
were
delayed
I
was
*NL*
miserable
and
overcome
by
a
thousand
fears
;
and
when
they
arrived
and
I
*NL*
saw
the
superscription
of
Elizabeth
or
my
father
,
I
hardly
dared
to
*NL*
read
and
ascertain
my
fate
.
Sometimes
I
thought
that
the
fiend
*NL*
followed
me
and
might
expedite
my
remissness
by
murdering
my
companion
.
*NL*
When
these
thoughts
possessed
me
,
I
would
not
quit
Henry
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
but
followed
him
as
his
shadow
,
to
protect
him
from
the
fancied
rage
of
*NL*
his
destroyer
.
I
felt
as
if
I
had
committed
some
great
crime
,
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
which
haunted
me
.
I
was
guiltless
,
but
I
had
indeed
*NL*
drawn
down
a
horrible
curse
upon
my
head
,
as
mortal
as
that
of
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
visited
Edinburgh
with
languid
eyes
and
mind
;
and
yet
that
city
might
*NL*
have
interested
the
most
unfortunate
being
.
Clerval
did
not
like
it
so
*NL*
well
as
Oxford
,
for
the
antiquity
of
the
latter
city
was
more
pleasing
*NL*
to
him
.
But
the
beauty
and
regularity
of
the
new
town
of
Edinburgh
,
*NL*
its
romantic
castle
and
its
environs
,
the
most
delightful
in
the
world
,
*NL*
Arthur
's
Seat
,
St.
Bernard
's
Well
,
and
the
Pentland
Hills
compensated
*NL*
him
for
the
change
and
filled
him
with
cheerfulness
and
admiration
.
But
*NL*
I
was
impatient
to
arrive
at
the
termination
of
my
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
Edinburgh
in
a
week
,
passing
through
Coupar
,
St.
Andrew
's
,
and
*NL*
along
the
banks
of
the
Tay
,
to
Perth
,
where
our
friend
expected
us
.
*NL*
But
I
was
in
no
mood
to
laugh
and
talk
with
strangers
or
enter
into
*NL*
their
feelings
or
plans
with
the
good
humour
expected
from
a
guest
;
and
*NL*
accordingly
I
told
Clerval
that
I
wished
to
make
the
tour
of
Scotland
*NL*
alone
.
``
Do
you
,
''
said
I
,
``
enjoy
yourself
,
and
let
this
be
our
*NL*
rendezvous
.
I
may
be
absent
a
month
or
two
;
but
do
not
interfere
with
*NL*
my
motions
,
I
entreat
you
;
leave
me
to
peace
and
solitude
for
a
short
*NL*
time
;
and
when
I
return
,
I
hope
it
will
be
with
a
lighter
heart
,
more
*NL*
congenial
to
your
own
temper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
wished
to
dissuade
me
,
but
seeing
me
bent
on
this
plan
,
ceased
to
*NL*
remonstrate
.
He
entreated
me
to
write
often
.
``
I
had
rather
be
with
*NL*
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
in
your
solitary
rambles
,
than
with
these
Scotch
*NL*
people
,
whom
I
do
not
know
;
hasten
,
then
,
my
dear
friend
,
to
return
,
*NL*
that
I
may
again
feel
myself
somewhat
at
home
,
which
I
can
not
do
in
*NL*
your
absence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
parted
from
my
friend
,
I
determined
to
visit
some
remote
spot
of
*NL*
Scotland
and
finish
my
work
in
solitude
.
I
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
*NL*
monster
followed
me
and
would
discover
himself
to
me
when
I
should
have
*NL*
finished
,
that
he
might
receive
his
companion
.
With
this
resolution
I
*NL*
traversed
the
northern
highlands
and
fixed
on
one
of
the
remotest
of
*NL*
the
Orkneys
as
the
scene
of
my
labours
.
It
was
a
place
fitted
for
such
*NL*
a
work
,
being
hardly
more
than
a
rock
whose
high
sides
were
continually
*NL*
beaten
upon
by
the
waves
.
The
soil
was
barren
,
scarcely
affording
*NL*
pasture
for
a
few
miserable
cows
,
and
oatmeal
for
its
inhabitants
,
*NL*
which
consisted
of
five
persons
,
whose
gaunt
and
scraggy
limbs
gave
*NL*
tokens
of
their
miserable
fare
.
Vegetables
and
bread
,
when
they
*NL*
indulged
in
such
luxuries
,
and
even
fresh
water
,
was
to
be
procured
*NL*
from
the
mainland
,
which
was
about
five
miles
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
island
there
were
but
three
miserable
huts
,
and
one
of
*NL*
these
was
vacant
when
I
arrived
.
This
I
hired
.
It
contained
but
two
*NL*
rooms
,
and
these
exhibited
all
the
squalidness
of
the
most
miserable
*NL*
penury
.
The
thatch
had
fallen
in
,
the
walls
were
unplastered
,
and
the
*NL*
door
was
off
its
hinges
.
I
ordered
it
to
be
repaired
,
bought
some
*NL*
furniture
,
and
took
possession
,
an
incident
which
would
doubtless
have
*NL*
occasioned
some
surprise
had
not
all
the
senses
of
the
cottagers
been
*NL*
benumbed
by
want
and
squalid
poverty
.
As
it
was
,
I
lived
ungazed
at
*NL*
and
unmolested
,
hardly
thanked
for
the
pittance
of
food
and
clothes
*NL*
which
I
gave
,
so
much
does
suffering
blunt
even
the
coarsest
sensations
*NL*
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
retreat
I
devoted
the
morning
to
labour
;
but
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
when
the
weather
permitted
,
I
walked
on
the
stony
beach
of
the
sea
to
*NL*
listen
to
the
waves
as
they
roared
and
dashed
at
my
feet
.
It
was
a
*NL*
monotonous
yet
ever-changing
scene
.
I
thought
of
Switzerland
;
it
was
*NL*
far
different
from
this
desolate
and
appalling
landscape
.
Its
hills
*NL*
are
covered
with
vines
,
and
its
cottages
are
scattered
thickly
in
the
*NL*
plains
.
Its
fair
lakes
reflect
a
blue
and
gentle
sky
,
and
when
*NL*
troubled
by
the
winds
,
their
tumult
is
but
as
the
play
of
a
lively
*NL*
infant
when
compared
to
the
roarings
of
the
giant
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
I
distributed
my
occupations
when
I
first
arrived
,
but
*NL*
as
I
proceeded
in
my
labour
,
it
became
every
day
more
horrible
and
*NL*
irksome
to
me
.
Sometimes
I
could
not
prevail
on
myself
to
enter
my
*NL*
laboratory
for
several
days
,
and
at
other
times
I
toiled
day
and
night
*NL*
in
order
to
complete
my
work
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
filthy
process
in
*NL*
which
I
was
engaged
.
During
my
first
experiment
,
a
kind
of
*NL*
enthusiastic
frenzy
had
blinded
me
to
the
horror
of
my
employment
;
my
*NL*
mind
was
intently
fixed
on
the
consummation
of
my
labour
,
and
my
eyes
*NL*
were
shut
to
the
horror
of
my
proceedings
.
But
now
I
went
to
it
in
*NL*
cold
blood
,
and
my
heart
often
sickened
at
the
work
of
my
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
situated
,
employed
in
the
most
detestable
occupation
,
immersed
in
*NL*
a
solitude
where
nothing
could
for
an
instant
call
my
attention
from
*NL*
the
actual
scene
in
which
I
was
engaged
,
my
spirits
became
unequal
;
I
*NL*
grew
restless
and
nervous
.
Every
moment
I
feared
to
meet
my
*NL*
persecutor
.
Sometimes
I
sat
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
,
fearing
*NL*
to
raise
them
lest
they
should
encounter
the
object
which
I
so
much
*NL*
dreaded
to
behold
.
I
feared
to
wander
from
the
sight
of
my
fellow
*NL*
creatures
lest
when
alone
he
should
come
to
claim
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mean
time
I
worked
on
,
and
my
labour
was
already
considerably
*NL*
advanced
.
I
looked
towards
its
completion
with
a
tremulous
and
eager
*NL*
hope
,
which
I
dared
not
trust
myself
to
question
but
which
was
*NL*
intermixed
with
obscure
forebodings
of
evil
that
made
my
heart
sicken
*NL*
in
my
bosom
.

Chapter
20
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
one
evening
in
my
laboratory
;
the
sun
had
set
,
and
the
moon
was
*NL*
just
rising
from
the
sea
;
I
had
not
sufficient
light
for
my
employment
,
*NL*
and
I
remained
idle
,
in
a
pause
of
consideration
of
whether
I
should
*NL*
leave
my
labour
for
the
night
or
hasten
its
conclusion
by
an
*NL*
unremitting
attention
to
it
.
As
I
sat
,
a
train
of
reflection
occurred
*NL*
to
me
which
led
me
to
consider
the
effects
of
what
I
was
now
doing
.
*NL*
Three
years
before
,
I
was
engaged
in
the
same
manner
and
had
created
a
*NL*
fiend
whose
unparalleled
barbarity
had
desolated
my
heart
and
filled
it
*NL*
forever
with
the
bitterest
remorse
.
I
was
now
about
to
form
another
*NL*
being
of
whose
dispositions
I
was
alike
ignorant
;
she
might
become
ten
*NL*
thousand
times
more
malignant
than
her
mate
and
delight
,
for
its
own
*NL*
sake
,
in
murder
and
wretchedness
.
He
had
sworn
to
quit
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
man
and
hide
himself
in
deserts
,
but
she
had
not
;
and
*NL*
she
,
who
in
all
probability
was
to
become
a
thinking
and
reasoning
*NL*
animal
,
might
refuse
to
comply
with
a
compact
made
before
her
creation
.
*NL*
They
might
even
hate
each
other
;
the
creature
who
already
lived
loathed
*NL*
his
own
deformity
,
and
might
he
not
conceive
a
greater
abhorrence
for
*NL*
it
when
it
came
before
his
eyes
in
the
female
form
?
She
also
might
*NL*
turn
with
disgust
from
him
to
the
superior
beauty
of
man
;
she
might
*NL*
quit
him
,
and
he
be
again
alone
,
exasperated
by
the
fresh
provocation
*NL*
of
being
deserted
by
one
of
his
own
species
.
Even
if
they
were
to
*NL*
leave
Europe
and
inhabit
the
deserts
of
the
new
world
,
yet
one
of
the
*NL*
first
results
of
those
sympathies
for
which
the
daemon
thirsted
would
*NL*
be
children
,
and
a
race
of
devils
would
be
propagated
upon
the
earth
*NL*
who
might
make
the
very
existence
of
the
species
of
man
a
condition
*NL*
precarious
and
full
of
terror
.
Had
I
right
,
for
my
own
benefit
,
to
*NL*
inflict
this
curse
upon
everlasting
generations
?
I
had
before
been
*NL*
moved
by
the
sophisms
of
the
being
I
had
created
;
I
had
been
struck
*NL*
senseless
by
his
fiendish
threats
;
but
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
*NL*
wickedness
of
my
promise
burst
upon
me
;
I
shuddered
to
think
that
*NL*
future
ages
might
curse
me
as
their
pest
,
whose
selfishness
had
not
*NL*
hesitated
to
buy
its
own
peace
at
the
price
,
perhaps
,
of
the
existence
*NL*
of
the
whole
human
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
and
my
heart
failed
within
me
,
when
,
on
looking
up
,
I
saw
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
moon
the
daemon
at
the
casement
.
A
ghastly
grin
*NL*
wrinkled
his
lips
as
he
gazed
on
me
,
where
I
sat
fulfilling
the
task
*NL*
which
he
had
allotted
to
me
.
Yes
,
he
had
followed
me
in
my
travels
;
he
*NL*
had
loitered
in
forests
,
hid
himself
in
caves
,
or
taken
refuge
in
wide
*NL*
and
desert
heaths
;
and
he
now
came
to
mark
my
progress
and
claim
the
*NL*
fulfilment
of
my
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
looked
on
him
,
his
countenance
expressed
the
utmost
extent
of
*NL*
malice
and
treachery
.
I
thought
with
a
sensation
of
madness
on
my
*NL*
promise
of
creating
another
like
to
him
,
and
trembling
with
passion
,
*NL*
tore
to
pieces
the
thing
on
which
I
was
engaged
.
The
wretch
saw
me
*NL*
destroy
the
creature
on
whose
future
existence
he
depended
for
*NL*
happiness
,
and
with
a
howl
of
devilish
despair
and
revenge
,
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
the
room
,
and
locking
the
door
,
made
a
solemn
vow
in
my
own
*NL*
heart
never
to
resume
my
labours
;
and
then
,
with
trembling
steps
,
I
*NL*
sought
my
own
apartment
.
I
was
alone
;
none
were
near
me
to
dissipate
*NL*
the
gloom
and
relieve
me
from
the
sickening
oppression
of
the
most
*NL*
terrible
reveries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
hours
passed
,
and
I
remained
near
my
window
gazing
on
the
sea
;
*NL*
it
was
almost
motionless
,
for
the
winds
were
hushed
,
and
all
nature
*NL*
reposed
under
the
eye
of
the
quiet
moon
.
A
few
fishing
vessels
alone
*NL*
specked
the
water
,
and
now
and
then
the
gentle
breeze
wafted
the
sound
*NL*
of
voices
as
the
fishermen
called
to
one
another
.
I
felt
the
silence
,
*NL*
although
I
was
hardly
conscious
of
its
extreme
profundity
,
until
my
ear
*NL*
was
suddenly
arrested
by
the
paddling
of
oars
near
the
shore
,
and
a
*NL*
person
landed
close
to
my
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
after
,
I
heard
the
creaking
of
my
door
,
as
if
some
one
*NL*
endeavoured
to
open
it
softly
.
I
trembled
from
head
to
foot
;
I
felt
a
*NL*
presentiment
of
who
it
was
and
wished
to
rouse
one
of
the
peasants
who
*NL*
dwelt
in
a
cottage
not
far
from
mine
;
but
I
was
overcome
by
the
*NL*
sensation
of
helplessness
,
so
often
felt
in
frightful
dreams
,
when
you
*NL*
in
vain
endeavour
to
fly
from
an
impending
danger
,
and
was
rooted
to
*NL*
the
spot
.
Presently
I
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
along
the
passage
;
*NL*
the
door
opened
,
and
the
wretch
whom
I
dreaded
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shutting
the
door
,
he
approached
me
and
said
in
a
smothered
voice
,
``
You
*NL*
have
destroyed
the
work
which
you
began
;
what
is
it
that
you
intend
?
*NL*
Do
you
dare
to
break
your
promise
?
I
have
endured
toil
and
misery
;
I
*NL*
left
Switzerland
with
you
;
I
crept
along
the
shores
of
the
Rhine
,
among
*NL*
its
willow
islands
and
over
the
summits
of
its
hills
.
I
have
dwelt
*NL*
many
months
in
the
heaths
of
England
and
among
the
deserts
of
Scotland
.
*NL*
I
have
endured
incalculable
fatigue
,
and
cold
,
and
hunger
;
do
you
dare
*NL*
destroy
my
hopes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begone
!
I
do
break
my
promise
;
never
will
I
create
another
like
*NL*
yourself
,
equal
in
deformity
and
wickedness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slave
,
I
before
reasoned
with
you
,
but
you
have
proved
yourself
*NL*
unworthy
of
my
condescension
.
Remember
that
I
have
power
;
you
believe
*NL*
yourself
miserable
,
but
I
can
make
you
so
wretched
that
the
light
of
*NL*
day
will
be
hateful
to
you
.
You
are
my
creator
,
but
I
am
your
master
;
*NL*
obey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hour
of
my
irresolution
is
past
,
and
the
period
of
your
power
is
*NL*
arrived
.
Your
threats
can
not
move
me
to
do
an
act
of
wickedness
;
but
*NL*
they
confirm
me
in
a
determination
of
not
creating
you
a
companion
in
*NL*
vice
.
Shall
I
,
in
cool
blood
,
set
loose
upon
the
earth
a
daemon
whose
*NL*
delight
is
in
death
and
wretchedness
?
Begone
!
I
am
firm
,
and
your
*NL*
words
will
only
exasperate
my
rage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
monster
saw
my
determination
in
my
face
and
gnashed
his
teeth
in
*NL*
the
impotence
of
anger
.
``
Shall
each
man
,
''
cried
he
,
``
find
a
wife
for
*NL*
his
bosom
,
and
each
beast
have
his
mate
,
and
I
be
alone
?
I
had
*NL*
feelings
of
affection
,
and
they
were
requited
by
detestation
and
scorn
.
*NL*
Man
!
You
may
hate
,
but
beware
!
Your
hours
will
pass
in
dread
and
*NL*
misery
,
and
soon
the
bolt
will
fall
which
must
ravish
from
you
your
*NL*
happiness
forever
.
Are
you
to
be
happy
while
I
grovel
in
the
intensity
*NL*
of
my
wretchedness
?
You
can
blast
my
other
passions
,
but
revenge
*NL*
remains
--
revenge
,
henceforth
dearer
than
light
or
food
!
I
may
die
,
but
*NL*
first
you
,
my
tyrant
and
tormentor
,
shall
curse
the
sun
that
gazes
on
*NL*
your
misery
.
Beware
,
for
I
am
fearless
and
therefore
powerful
.
I
will
*NL*
watch
with
the
wiliness
of
a
snake
,
that
I
may
sting
with
its
venom
.
*NL*
Man
,
you
shall
repent
of
the
injuries
you
inflict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
,
cease
;
and
do
not
poison
the
air
with
these
sounds
of
malice
.
*NL*
I
have
declared
my
resolution
to
you
,
and
I
am
no
coward
to
bend
*NL*
beneath
words
.
Leave
me
;
I
am
inexorable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
.
I
go
;
but
remember
,
I
shall
be
with
you
on
your
*NL*
wedding-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
started
forward
and
exclaimed
,
``
Villain
!
Before
you
sign
my
*NL*
death-warrant
,
be
sure
that
you
are
yourself
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
seized
him
,
but
he
eluded
me
and
quitted
the
house
with
*NL*
precipitation
.
In
a
few
moments
I
saw
him
in
his
boat
,
which
shot
*NL*
across
the
waters
with
an
arrowy
swiftness
and
was
soon
lost
amidst
the
*NL*
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
again
silent
,
but
his
words
rang
in
my
ears
.
I
burned
with
*NL*
rage
to
pursue
the
murderer
of
my
peace
and
precipitate
him
into
the
*NL*
ocean
.
I
walked
up
and
down
my
room
hastily
and
perturbed
,
while
my
*NL*
imagination
conjured
up
a
thousand
images
to
torment
and
sting
me
.
Why
*NL*
had
I
not
followed
him
and
closed
with
him
in
mortal
strife
?
But
I
had
*NL*
suffered
him
to
depart
,
and
he
had
directed
his
course
towards
the
*NL*
mainland
.
I
shuddered
to
think
who
might
be
the
next
victim
sacrificed
*NL*
to
his
insatiate
revenge
.
And
then
I
thought
again
of
his
words
--
``
I
*NL*
WILL
BE
WITH
YOU
ON
YOUR
WEDDING-NIGHT
.
''
That
,
then
,
was
the
period
*NL*
fixed
for
the
fulfilment
of
my
destiny
.
In
that
hour
I
should
die
and
*NL*
at
once
satisfy
and
extinguish
his
malice
.
The
prospect
did
not
move
*NL*
me
to
fear
;
yet
when
I
thought
of
my
beloved
Elizabeth
,
of
her
tears
*NL*
and
endless
sorrow
,
when
she
should
find
her
lover
so
barbarously
*NL*
snatched
from
her
,
tears
,
the
first
I
had
shed
for
many
months
,
*NL*
streamed
from
my
eyes
,
and
I
resolved
not
to
fall
before
my
enemy
*NL*
without
a
bitter
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
passed
away
,
and
the
sun
rose
from
the
ocean
;
my
feelings
*NL*
became
calmer
,
if
it
may
be
called
calmness
when
the
violence
of
rage
*NL*
sinks
into
the
depths
of
despair
.
I
left
the
house
,
the
horrid
scene
*NL*
of
the
last
night
's
contention
,
and
walked
on
the
beach
of
the
sea
,
*NL*
which
I
almost
regarded
as
an
insuperable
barrier
between
me
and
my
*NL*
fellow
creatures
;
nay
,
a
wish
that
such
should
prove
the
fact
stole
*NL*
across
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
desired
that
I
might
pass
my
life
on
that
barren
rock
,
wearily
,
it
is
*NL*
true
,
but
uninterrupted
by
any
sudden
shock
of
misery
.
If
I
returned
,
*NL*
it
was
to
be
sacrificed
or
to
see
those
whom
I
most
loved
die
under
the
*NL*
grasp
of
a
daemon
whom
I
had
myself
created
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
about
the
isle
like
a
restless
spectre
,
separated
from
all
it
*NL*
loved
and
miserable
in
the
separation
.
When
it
became
noon
,
and
the
*NL*
sun
rose
higher
,
I
lay
down
on
the
grass
and
was
overpowered
by
a
deep
*NL*
sleep
.
I
had
been
awake
the
whole
of
the
preceding
night
,
my
nerves
*NL*
were
agitated
,
and
my
eyes
inflamed
by
watching
and
misery
.
The
sleep
*NL*
into
which
I
now
sank
refreshed
me
;
and
when
I
awoke
,
I
again
felt
as
*NL*
if
I
belonged
to
a
race
of
human
beings
like
myself
,
and
I
began
to
*NL*
reflect
upon
what
had
passed
with
greater
composure
;
yet
still
the
*NL*
words
of
the
fiend
rang
in
my
ears
like
a
death-knell
;
they
appeared
*NL*
like
a
dream
,
yet
distinct
and
oppressive
as
a
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
far
descended
,
and
I
still
sat
on
the
shore
,
satisfying
my
*NL*
appetite
,
which
had
become
ravenous
,
with
an
oaten
cake
,
when
I
saw
a
*NL*
fishing-boat
land
close
to
me
,
and
one
of
the
men
brought
me
a
packet
;
*NL*
it
contained
letters
from
Geneva
,
and
one
from
Clerval
entreating
me
to
*NL*
join
him
.
He
said
that
he
was
wearing
away
his
time
fruitlessly
where
*NL*
he
was
,
that
letters
from
the
friends
he
had
formed
in
London
desired
*NL*
his
return
to
complete
the
negotiation
they
had
entered
into
for
his
*NL*
Indian
enterprise
.
He
could
not
any
longer
delay
his
departure
;
but
as
*NL*
his
journey
to
London
might
be
followed
,
even
sooner
than
he
now
*NL*
conjectured
,
by
his
longer
voyage
,
he
entreated
me
to
bestow
as
much
of
*NL*
my
society
on
him
as
I
could
spare
.
He
besought
me
,
therefore
,
to
*NL*
leave
my
solitary
isle
and
to
meet
him
at
Perth
,
that
we
might
proceed
*NL*
southwards
together
.
This
letter
in
a
degree
recalled
me
to
life
,
and
*NL*
I
determined
to
quit
my
island
at
the
expiration
of
two
days
.
Yet
,
*NL*
before
I
departed
,
there
was
a
task
to
perform
,
on
which
I
shuddered
to
*NL*
reflect
;
I
must
pack
up
my
chemical
instruments
,
and
for
that
purpose
I
*NL*
must
enter
the
room
which
had
been
the
scene
of
my
odious
work
,
and
I
*NL*
must
handle
those
utensils
the
sight
of
which
was
sickening
to
me
.
The
*NL*
next
morning
,
at
daybreak
,
I
summoned
sufficient
courage
and
unlocked
*NL*
the
door
of
my
laboratory
.
The
remains
of
the
half-finished
creature
,
*NL*
whom
I
had
destroyed
,
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
,
and
I
almost
felt
as
*NL*
if
I
had
mangled
the
living
flesh
of
a
human
being
.
I
paused
to
*NL*
collect
myself
and
then
entered
the
chamber
.
With
trembling
hand
I
*NL*
conveyed
the
instruments
out
of
the
room
,
but
I
reflected
that
I
ought
*NL*
not
to
leave
the
relics
of
my
work
to
excite
the
horror
and
suspicion
*NL*
of
the
peasants
;
and
I
accordingly
put
them
into
a
basket
,
with
a
great
*NL*
quantity
of
stones
,
and
laying
them
up
,
determined
to
throw
them
into
*NL*
the
sea
that
very
night
;
and
in
the
meantime
I
sat
upon
the
beach
,
*NL*
employed
in
cleaning
and
arranging
my
chemical
apparatus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
more
complete
than
the
alteration
that
had
taken
place
*NL*
in
my
feelings
since
the
night
of
the
appearance
of
the
daemon
.
I
had
*NL*
before
regarded
my
promise
with
a
gloomy
despair
as
a
thing
that
,
with
*NL*
whatever
consequences
,
must
be
fulfilled
;
but
I
now
felt
as
if
a
film
*NL*
had
been
taken
from
before
my
eyes
and
that
I
for
the
first
time
saw
*NL*
clearly
.
The
idea
of
renewing
my
labours
did
not
for
one
instant
occur
*NL*
to
me
;
the
threat
I
had
heard
weighed
on
my
thoughts
,
but
I
did
not
*NL*
reflect
that
a
voluntary
act
of
mine
could
avert
it
.
I
had
resolved
in
*NL*
my
own
mind
that
to
create
another
like
the
fiend
I
had
first
made
*NL*
would
be
an
act
of
the
basest
and
most
atrocious
selfishness
,
and
I
*NL*
banished
from
my
mind
every
thought
that
could
lead
to
a
different
*NL*
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
the
moon
rose
;
and
I
then
,
putting
*NL*
my
basket
aboard
a
little
skiff
,
sailed
out
about
four
miles
from
the
*NL*
shore
.
The
scene
was
perfectly
solitary
;
a
few
boats
were
returning
*NL*
towards
land
,
but
I
sailed
away
from
them
.
I
felt
as
if
I
was
about
*NL*
the
commission
of
a
dreadful
crime
and
avoided
with
shuddering
anxiety
*NL*
any
encounter
with
my
fellow
creatures
.
At
one
time
the
moon
,
which
*NL*
had
before
been
clear
,
was
suddenly
overspread
by
a
thick
cloud
,
and
I
*NL*
took
advantage
of
the
moment
of
darkness
and
cast
my
basket
into
the
*NL*
sea
;
I
listened
to
the
gurgling
sound
as
it
sank
and
then
sailed
away
*NL*
from
the
spot
.
The
sky
became
clouded
,
but
the
air
was
pure
,
although
*NL*
chilled
by
the
northeast
breeze
that
was
then
rising
.
But
it
refreshed
*NL*
me
and
filled
me
with
such
agreeable
sensations
that
I
resolved
to
*NL*
prolong
my
stay
on
the
water
,
and
fixing
the
rudder
in
a
direct
*NL*
position
,
stretched
myself
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
Clouds
hid
the
*NL*
moon
,
everything
was
obscure
,
and
I
heard
only
the
sound
of
the
boat
as
*NL*
its
keel
cut
through
the
waves
;
the
murmur
lulled
me
,
and
in
a
short
*NL*
time
I
slept
soundly
.
I
do
not
know
how
long
I
remained
in
this
*NL*
situation
,
but
when
I
awoke
I
found
that
the
sun
had
already
mounted
*NL*
considerably
.
The
wind
was
high
,
and
the
waves
continually
threatened
*NL*
the
safety
of
my
little
skiff
.
I
found
that
the
wind
was
northeast
and
*NL*
must
have
driven
me
far
from
the
coast
from
which
I
had
embarked
.
I
*NL*
endeavoured
to
change
my
course
but
quickly
found
that
if
I
again
made
*NL*
the
attempt
the
boat
would
be
instantly
filled
with
water
.
Thus
*NL*
situated
,
my
only
resource
was
to
drive
before
the
wind
.
I
confess
*NL*
that
I
felt
a
few
sensations
of
terror
.
I
had
no
compass
with
me
and
*NL*
was
so
slenderly
acquainted
with
the
geography
of
this
part
of
the
*NL*
world
that
the
sun
was
of
little
benefit
to
me
.
I
might
be
driven
into
*NL*
the
wide
Atlantic
and
feel
all
the
tortures
of
starvation
or
be
*NL*
swallowed
up
in
the
immeasurable
waters
that
roared
and
buffeted
around
*NL*
me
.
I
had
already
been
out
many
hours
and
felt
the
torment
of
a
*NL*
burning
thirst
,
a
prelude
to
my
other
sufferings
.
I
looked
on
the
*NL*
heavens
,
which
were
covered
by
clouds
that
flew
before
the
wind
,
only
*NL*
to
be
replaced
by
others
;
I
looked
upon
the
sea
;
it
was
to
be
my
grave
.
*NL*
``
Fiend
,
''
I
exclaimed
,
``
your
task
is
already
fulfilled
!
''
I
thought
of
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
of
my
father
,
and
of
Clerval
--
all
left
behind
,
on
whom
the
*NL*
monster
might
satisfy
his
sanguinary
and
merciless
passions
.
This
idea
*NL*
plunged
me
into
a
reverie
so
despairing
and
frightful
that
even
now
,
*NL*
when
the
scene
is
on
the
point
of
closing
before
me
forever
,
I
shudder
*NL*
to
reflect
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
hours
passed
thus
;
but
by
degrees
,
as
the
sun
declined
towards
the
*NL*
horizon
,
the
wind
died
away
into
a
gentle
breeze
and
the
sea
became
*NL*
free
from
breakers
.
But
these
gave
place
to
a
heavy
swell
;
I
felt
sick
*NL*
and
hardly
able
to
hold
the
rudder
,
when
suddenly
I
saw
a
line
of
high
*NL*
land
towards
the
south
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
spent
,
as
I
was
,
by
fatigue
and
the
dreadful
suspense
I
endured
*NL*
for
several
hours
,
this
sudden
certainty
of
life
rushed
like
a
flood
of
*NL*
warm
joy
to
my
heart
,
and
tears
gushed
from
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
mutable
are
our
feelings
,
and
how
strange
is
that
clinging
love
we
*NL*
have
of
life
even
in
the
excess
of
misery
!
I
constructed
another
sail
*NL*
with
a
part
of
my
dress
and
eagerly
steered
my
course
towards
the
land
.
*NL*
It
had
a
wild
and
rocky
appearance
,
but
as
I
approached
nearer
I
easily
*NL*
perceived
the
traces
of
cultivation
.
I
saw
vessels
near
the
shore
and
*NL*
found
myself
suddenly
transported
back
to
the
neighbourhood
of
*NL*
civilized
man
.
I
carefully
traced
the
windings
of
the
land
and
hailed
*NL*
a
steeple
which
I
at
length
saw
issuing
from
behind
a
small
promontory
.
*NL*
As
I
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
debility
,
I
resolved
to
sail
directly
*NL*
towards
the
town
,
as
a
place
where
I
could
most
easily
procure
*NL*
nourishment
.
Fortunately
I
had
money
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
turned
the
promontory
I
perceived
a
small
neat
town
and
a
good
*NL*
harbour
,
which
I
entered
,
my
heart
bounding
with
joy
at
my
unexpected
*NL*
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
occupied
in
fixing
the
boat
and
arranging
the
sails
,
several
*NL*
people
crowded
towards
the
spot
.
They
seemed
much
surprised
at
my
*NL*
appearance
,
but
instead
of
offering
me
any
assistance
,
whispered
*NL*
together
with
gestures
that
at
any
other
time
might
have
produced
in
me
*NL*
a
slight
sensation
of
alarm
.
As
it
was
,
I
merely
remarked
that
they
*NL*
spoke
English
,
and
I
therefore
addressed
them
in
that
language
.
``
My
*NL*
good
friends
,
''
said
I
,
``
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
the
name
of
*NL*
this
town
and
inform
me
where
I
am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
know
that
soon
enough
,
''
replied
a
man
with
a
hoarse
voice
.
*NL*
``
Maybe
you
are
come
to
a
place
that
will
not
prove
much
to
your
taste
,
*NL*
but
you
will
not
be
consulted
as
to
your
quarters
,
I
promise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
exceedingly
surprised
on
receiving
so
rude
an
answer
from
a
*NL*
stranger
,
and
I
was
also
disconcerted
on
perceiving
the
frowning
and
*NL*
angry
countenances
of
his
companions
.
``
Why
do
you
answer
me
so
*NL*
roughly
?
''
I
replied
.
``
Surely
it
is
not
the
custom
of
Englishmen
to
*NL*
receive
strangers
so
inhospitably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
what
the
custom
of
the
English
may
be
,
*NL*
but
it
is
the
custom
of
the
Irish
to
hate
villains
.
''
While
this
strange
*NL*
dialogue
continued
,
I
perceived
the
crowd
rapidly
increase
.
Their
*NL*
faces
expressed
a
mixture
of
curiosity
and
anger
,
which
annoyed
and
in
*NL*
some
degree
alarmed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
inquired
the
way
to
the
inn
,
but
no
one
replied
.
I
then
moved
*NL*
forward
,
and
a
murmuring
sound
arose
from
the
crowd
as
they
followed
*NL*
and
surrounded
me
,
when
an
ill-looking
man
approaching
tapped
me
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
and
said
,
``
Come
,
sir
,
you
must
follow
me
to
Mr.
Kirwin
's
to
*NL*
give
an
account
of
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
Mr.
Kirwin
?
Why
am
I
to
give
an
account
of
myself
?
Is
not
*NL*
this
a
free
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
sir
,
free
enough
for
honest
folks
.
Mr.
Kirwin
is
a
magistrate
,
*NL*
and
you
are
to
give
an
account
of
the
death
of
a
gentleman
who
was
*NL*
found
murdered
here
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
answer
startled
me
,
but
I
presently
recovered
myself
.
I
was
*NL*
innocent
;
that
could
easily
be
proved
;
accordingly
I
followed
my
*NL*
conductor
in
silence
and
was
led
to
one
of
the
best
houses
in
the
town
.
*NL*
I
was
ready
to
sink
from
fatigue
and
hunger
,
but
being
surrounded
by
a
*NL*
crowd
,
I
thought
it
politic
to
rouse
all
my
strength
,
that
no
physical
*NL*
debility
might
be
construed
into
apprehension
or
conscious
guilt
.
*NL*
Little
did
I
then
expect
the
calamity
that
was
in
a
few
moments
to
*NL*
overwhelm
me
and
extinguish
in
horror
and
despair
all
fear
of
ignominy
*NL*
or
death
.
I
must
pause
here
,
for
it
requires
all
my
fortitude
to
recall
*NL*
the
memory
of
the
frightful
events
which
I
am
about
to
relate
,
in
*NL*
proper
detail
,
to
my
recollection
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
21
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
soon
introduced
into
the
presence
of
the
magistrate
,
an
old
*NL*
benevolent
man
with
calm
and
mild
manners
.
He
looked
upon
me
,
however
,
*NL*
with
some
degree
of
severity
,
and
then
,
turning
towards
my
conductors
,
*NL*
he
asked
who
appeared
as
witnesses
on
this
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
half
a
dozen
men
came
forward
;
and
,
one
being
selected
by
the
*NL*
magistrate
,
he
deposed
that
he
had
been
out
fishing
the
night
before
*NL*
with
his
son
and
brother-in-law
,
Daniel
Nugent
,
when
,
about
ten
*NL*
o'clock
,
they
observed
a
strong
northerly
blast
rising
,
and
they
*NL*
accordingly
put
in
for
port
.
It
was
a
very
dark
night
,
as
the
moon
had
*NL*
not
yet
risen
;
they
did
not
land
at
the
harbour
,
but
,
as
they
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
,
at
a
creek
about
two
miles
below
.
He
walked
on
first
,
*NL*
carrying
a
part
of
the
fishing
tackle
,
and
his
companions
followed
him
*NL*
at
some
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
proceeding
along
the
sands
,
he
struck
his
foot
against
*NL*
something
and
fell
at
his
length
on
the
ground
.
His
companions
came
up
*NL*
to
assist
him
,
and
by
the
light
of
their
lantern
they
found
that
he
had
*NL*
fallen
on
the
body
of
a
man
,
who
was
to
all
appearance
dead
.
Their
*NL*
first
supposition
was
that
it
was
the
corpse
of
some
person
who
had
*NL*
been
drowned
and
was
thrown
on
shore
by
the
waves
,
but
on
examination
*NL*
they
found
that
the
clothes
were
not
wet
and
even
that
the
body
was
not
*NL*
then
cold
.
They
instantly
carried
it
to
the
cottage
of
an
old
woman
*NL*
near
the
spot
and
endeavoured
,
but
in
vain
,
to
restore
it
to
life
.
It
*NL*
appeared
to
be
a
handsome
young
man
,
about
five
and
twenty
years
of
*NL*
age
.
He
had
apparently
been
strangled
,
for
there
was
no
sign
of
any
*NL*
violence
except
the
black
mark
of
fingers
on
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
part
of
this
deposition
did
not
in
the
least
interest
me
,
but
*NL*
when
the
mark
of
the
fingers
was
mentioned
I
remembered
the
murder
of
*NL*
my
brother
and
felt
myself
extremely
agitated
;
my
limbs
trembled
,
and
a
*NL*
mist
came
over
my
eyes
,
which
obliged
me
to
lean
on
a
chair
for
*NL*
support
.
The
magistrate
observed
me
with
a
keen
eye
and
of
course
drew
*NL*
an
unfavourable
augury
from
my
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
son
confirmed
his
father
's
account
,
but
when
Daniel
Nugent
was
*NL*
called
he
swore
positively
that
just
before
the
fall
of
his
companion
,
*NL*
he
saw
a
boat
,
with
a
single
man
in
it
,
at
a
short
distance
from
the
*NL*
shore
;
and
as
far
as
he
could
judge
by
the
light
of
a
few
stars
,
it
was
*NL*
the
same
boat
in
which
I
had
just
landed
.
A
woman
deposed
that
she
*NL*
lived
near
the
beach
and
was
standing
at
the
door
of
her
cottage
,
*NL*
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
fishermen
,
about
an
hour
before
she
heard
*NL*
of
the
discovery
of
the
body
,
when
she
saw
a
boat
with
only
one
man
in
*NL*
it
push
off
from
that
part
of
the
shore
where
the
corpse
was
afterwards
*NL*
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
woman
confirmed
the
account
of
the
fishermen
having
brought
the
*NL*
body
into
her
house
;
it
was
not
cold
.
They
put
it
into
a
bed
and
*NL*
rubbed
it
,
and
Daniel
went
to
the
town
for
an
apothecary
,
but
life
was
*NL*
quite
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
other
men
were
examined
concerning
my
landing
,
and
they
agreed
*NL*
that
,
with
the
strong
north
wind
that
had
arisen
during
the
night
,
it
*NL*
was
very
probable
that
I
had
beaten
about
for
many
hours
and
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
return
nearly
to
the
same
spot
from
which
I
had
departed
.
*NL*
Besides
,
they
observed
that
it
appeared
that
I
had
brought
the
body
*NL*
from
another
place
,
and
it
was
likely
that
as
I
did
not
appear
to
know
*NL*
the
shore
,
I
might
have
put
into
the
harbour
ignorant
of
the
distance
*NL*
of
the
town
of
--
from
the
place
where
I
had
deposited
the
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kirwin
,
on
hearing
this
evidence
,
desired
that
I
should
be
taken
*NL*
into
the
room
where
the
body
lay
for
interment
,
that
it
might
be
*NL*
observed
what
effect
the
sight
of
it
would
produce
upon
me
.
This
idea
*NL*
was
probably
suggested
by
the
extreme
agitation
I
had
exhibited
when
*NL*
the
mode
of
the
murder
had
been
described
.
I
was
accordingly
*NL*
conducted
,
by
the
magistrate
and
several
other
persons
,
to
the
inn
.
I
*NL*
could
not
help
being
struck
by
the
strange
coincidences
that
had
taken
*NL*
place
during
this
eventful
night
;
but
,
knowing
that
I
had
been
*NL*
conversing
with
several
persons
in
the
island
I
had
inhabited
about
the
*NL*
time
that
the
body
had
been
found
,
I
was
perfectly
tranquil
as
to
the
*NL*
consequences
of
the
affair
.
I
entered
the
room
where
the
corpse
lay
*NL*
and
was
led
up
to
the
coffin
.
How
can
I
describe
my
sensations
on
*NL*
beholding
it
?
I
feel
yet
parched
with
horror
,
nor
can
I
reflect
on
*NL*
that
terrible
moment
without
shuddering
and
agony
.
The
examination
,
*NL*
the
presence
of
the
magistrate
and
witnesses
,
passed
like
a
dream
from
*NL*
my
memory
when
I
saw
the
lifeless
form
of
Henry
Clerval
stretched
*NL*
before
me
.
I
gasped
for
breath
,
and
throwing
myself
on
the
body
,
I
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Have
my
murderous
machinations
deprived
you
also
,
my
*NL*
dearest
Henry
,
of
life
?
Two
I
have
already
destroyed
;
other
victims
*NL*
await
their
destiny
;
but
you
,
Clerval
,
my
friend
,
my
benefactor
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
human
frame
could
no
longer
support
the
agonies
that
I
endured
,
and
*NL*
I
was
carried
out
of
the
room
in
strong
convulsions
.
A
fever
succeeded
*NL*
to
this
.
I
lay
for
two
months
on
the
point
of
death
;
my
ravings
,
as
I
*NL*
afterwards
heard
,
were
frightful
;
I
called
myself
the
murderer
of
*NL*
William
,
of
Justine
,
and
of
Clerval
.
Sometimes
I
entreated
my
*NL*
attendants
to
assist
me
in
the
destruction
of
the
fiend
by
whom
I
was
*NL*
tormented
;
and
at
others
I
felt
the
fingers
of
the
monster
already
*NL*
grasping
my
neck
,
and
screamed
aloud
with
agony
and
terror
.
*NL*
Fortunately
,
as
I
spoke
my
native
language
,
Mr.
Kirwin
alone
understood
*NL*
me
;
but
my
gestures
and
bitter
cries
were
sufficient
to
affright
the
*NL*
other
witnesses
.
Why
did
I
not
die
?
More
miserable
than
man
ever
was
*NL*
before
,
why
did
I
not
sink
into
forgetfulness
and
rest
?
Death
snatches
*NL*
away
many
blooming
children
,
the
only
hopes
of
their
doting
parents
;
*NL*
how
many
brides
and
youthful
lovers
have
been
one
day
in
the
bloom
of
*NL*
health
and
hope
,
and
the
next
a
prey
for
worms
and
the
decay
of
the
*NL*
tomb
!
Of
what
materials
was
I
made
that
I
could
thus
resist
so
many
*NL*
shocks
,
which
,
like
the
turning
of
the
wheel
,
continually
renewed
the
*NL*
torture
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
doomed
to
live
and
in
two
months
found
myself
as
awaking
from
*NL*
a
dream
,
in
a
prison
,
stretched
on
a
wretched
bed
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
jailers
,
turnkeys
,
bolts
,
and
all
the
miserable
apparatus
of
a
dungeon
.
*NL*
It
was
morning
,
I
remember
,
when
I
thus
awoke
to
understanding
;
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
the
particulars
of
what
had
happened
and
only
felt
as
if
some
*NL*
great
misfortune
had
suddenly
overwhelmed
me
;
but
when
I
looked
around
*NL*
and
saw
the
barred
windows
and
the
squalidness
of
the
room
in
which
I
*NL*
was
,
all
flashed
across
my
memory
and
I
groaned
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sound
disturbed
an
old
woman
who
was
sleeping
in
a
chair
beside
*NL*
me
.
She
was
a
hired
nurse
,
the
wife
of
one
of
the
turnkeys
,
and
her
*NL*
countenance
expressed
all
those
bad
qualities
which
often
characterize
*NL*
that
class
.
The
lines
of
her
face
were
hard
and
rude
,
like
that
of
*NL*
persons
accustomed
to
see
without
sympathizing
in
sights
of
misery
.
Her
*NL*
tone
expressed
her
entire
indifference
;
she
addressed
me
in
English
,
*NL*
and
the
voice
struck
me
as
one
that
I
had
heard
during
my
sufferings
.
*NL*
``
Are
you
better
now
,
sir
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
in
the
same
language
,
with
a
feeble
voice
,
``
I
believe
I
am
;
*NL*
but
if
it
be
all
true
,
if
indeed
I
did
not
dream
,
I
am
sorry
that
I
am
*NL*
still
alive
to
feel
this
misery
and
horror
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
that
matter
,
''
replied
the
old
woman
,
``
if
you
mean
about
the
*NL*
gentleman
you
murdered
,
I
believe
that
it
were
better
for
you
if
you
*NL*
were
dead
,
for
I
fancy
it
will
go
hard
with
you
!
However
,
that
's
none
*NL*
of
my
business
;
I
am
sent
to
nurse
you
and
get
you
well
;
I
do
my
duty
*NL*
with
a
safe
conscience
;
it
were
well
if
everybody
did
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
with
loathing
from
the
woman
who
could
utter
so
unfeeling
a
*NL*
speech
to
a
person
just
saved
,
on
the
very
edge
of
death
;
but
I
felt
*NL*
languid
and
unable
to
reflect
on
all
that
had
passed
.
The
whole
series
*NL*
of
my
life
appeared
to
me
as
a
dream
;
I
sometimes
doubted
if
indeed
it
*NL*
were
all
true
,
for
it
never
presented
itself
to
my
mind
with
the
force
*NL*
of
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
images
that
floated
before
me
became
more
distinct
,
I
grew
*NL*
feverish
;
a
darkness
pressed
around
me
;
no
one
was
near
me
who
soothed
*NL*
me
with
the
gentle
voice
of
love
;
no
dear
hand
supported
me
.
The
*NL*
physician
came
and
prescribed
medicines
,
and
the
old
woman
prepared
*NL*
them
for
me
;
but
utter
carelessness
was
visible
in
the
first
,
and
the
*NL*
expression
of
brutality
was
strongly
marked
in
the
visage
of
the
*NL*
second
.
Who
could
be
interested
in
the
fate
of
a
murderer
but
the
*NL*
hangman
who
would
gain
his
fee
?
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
my
first
reflections
,
but
I
soon
learned
that
Mr.
Kirwin
had
*NL*
shown
me
extreme
kindness
.
He
had
caused
the
best
room
in
the
prison
*NL*
to
be
prepared
for
me
-LRB-
wretched
indeed
was
the
best
-RRB-
;
and
it
was
he
who
*NL*
had
provided
a
physician
and
a
nurse
.
It
is
true
,
he
seldom
came
to
*NL*
see
me
,
for
although
he
ardently
desired
to
relieve
the
sufferings
of
*NL*
every
human
creature
,
he
did
not
wish
to
be
present
at
the
agonies
and
*NL*
miserable
ravings
of
a
murderer
.
He
came
,
therefore
,
sometimes
to
see
*NL*
that
I
was
not
neglected
,
but
his
visits
were
short
and
with
long
*NL*
intervals
.
One
day
,
while
I
was
gradually
recovering
,
I
was
seated
in
*NL*
a
chair
,
my
eyes
half
open
and
my
cheeks
livid
like
those
in
death
.
I
*NL*
was
overcome
by
gloom
and
misery
and
often
reflected
I
had
better
seek
*NL*
death
than
desire
to
remain
in
a
world
which
to
me
was
replete
with
*NL*
wretchedness
.
At
one
time
I
considered
whether
I
should
not
declare
*NL*
myself
guilty
and
suffer
the
penalty
of
the
law
,
less
innocent
than
*NL*
poor
Justine
had
been
.
Such
were
my
thoughts
when
the
door
of
my
*NL*
apartment
was
opened
and
Mr.
Kirwin
entered
.
His
countenance
expressed
*NL*
sympathy
and
compassion
;
he
drew
a
chair
close
to
mine
and
addressed
me
*NL*
in
French
,
``
I
fear
that
this
place
is
very
shocking
to
you
;
can
I
do
*NL*
anything
to
make
you
more
comfortable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
but
all
that
you
mention
is
nothing
to
me
;
on
the
whole
*NL*
earth
there
is
no
comfort
which
I
am
capable
of
receiving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
the
sympathy
of
a
stranger
can
be
but
of
little
relief
to
*NL*
one
borne
down
as
you
are
by
so
strange
a
misfortune
.
But
you
will
,
I
*NL*
hope
,
soon
quit
this
melancholy
abode
,
for
doubtless
evidence
can
*NL*
easily
be
brought
to
free
you
from
the
criminal
charge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
least
concern
;
I
am
,
by
a
course
of
strange
events
,
become
*NL*
the
most
miserable
of
mortals
.
Persecuted
and
tortured
as
I
am
and
*NL*
have
been
,
can
death
be
any
evil
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
indeed
could
be
more
unfortunate
and
agonizing
than
the
*NL*
strange
chances
that
have
lately
occurred
.
You
were
thrown
,
by
some
*NL*
surprising
accident
,
on
this
shore
,
renowned
for
its
hospitality
,
*NL*
seized
immediately
,
and
charged
with
murder
.
The
first
sight
that
was
*NL*
presented
to
your
eyes
was
the
body
of
your
friend
,
murdered
in
so
*NL*
unaccountable
a
manner
and
placed
,
as
it
were
,
by
some
fiend
across
*NL*
your
path
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Kirwin
said
this
,
notwithstanding
the
agitation
I
endured
on
*NL*
this
retrospect
of
my
sufferings
,
I
also
felt
considerable
surprise
at
*NL*
the
knowledge
he
seemed
to
possess
concerning
me
.
I
suppose
some
*NL*
astonishment
was
exhibited
in
my
countenance
,
for
Mr.
Kirwin
hastened
*NL*
to
say
,
``
Immediately
upon
your
being
taken
ill
,
all
the
papers
that
*NL*
were
on
your
person
were
brought
me
,
and
I
examined
them
that
I
might
*NL*
discover
some
trace
by
which
I
could
send
to
your
relations
an
account
*NL*
of
your
misfortune
and
illness
.
I
found
several
letters
,
and
,
among
*NL*
others
,
one
which
I
discovered
from
its
commencement
to
be
from
your
*NL*
father
.
I
instantly
wrote
to
Geneva
;
nearly
two
months
have
elapsed
*NL*
since
the
departure
of
my
letter
.
But
you
are
ill
;
even
now
you
*NL*
tremble
;
you
are
unfit
for
agitation
of
any
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
suspense
is
a
thousand
times
worse
than
the
most
horrible
event
;
*NL*
tell
me
what
new
scene
of
death
has
been
acted
,
and
whose
murder
I
am
*NL*
now
to
lament
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
family
is
perfectly
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Kirwin
with
gentleness
;
``
and
*NL*
someone
,
a
friend
,
is
come
to
visit
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
not
by
what
chain
of
thought
the
idea
presented
itself
,
but
it
*NL*
instantly
darted
into
my
mind
that
the
murderer
had
come
to
mock
at
my
*NL*
misery
and
taunt
me
with
the
death
of
Clerval
,
as
a
new
incitement
for
*NL*
me
to
comply
with
his
hellish
desires
.
I
put
my
hand
before
my
eyes
,
*NL*
and
cried
out
in
agony
,
``
Oh
!
Take
him
away
!
I
can
not
see
him
;
for
*NL*
God
's
sake
,
do
not
let
him
enter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kirwin
regarded
me
with
a
troubled
countenance
.
He
could
not
help
*NL*
regarding
my
exclamation
as
a
presumption
of
my
guilt
and
said
in
*NL*
rather
a
severe
tone
,
``
I
should
have
thought
,
young
man
,
that
the
*NL*
presence
of
your
father
would
have
been
welcome
instead
of
inspiring
*NL*
such
violent
repugnance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
!
''
cried
I
,
while
every
feature
and
every
muscle
was
relaxed
*NL*
from
anguish
to
pleasure
.
``
Is
my
father
indeed
come
?
How
kind
,
how
*NL*
very
kind
!
But
where
is
he
,
why
does
he
not
hasten
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
change
of
manner
surprised
and
pleased
the
magistrate
;
perhaps
he
*NL*
thought
that
my
former
exclamation
was
a
momentary
return
of
delirium
,
*NL*
and
now
he
instantly
resumed
his
former
benevolence
.
He
rose
and
*NL*
quitted
the
room
with
my
nurse
,
and
in
a
moment
my
father
entered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
,
at
this
moment
,
could
have
given
me
greater
pleasure
than
the
*NL*
arrival
of
my
father
.
I
stretched
out
my
hand
to
him
and
cried
,
``
Are
*NL*
you
,
then
,
safe
--
and
Elizabeth
--
and
Ernest
?
''
My
father
calmed
me
with
*NL*
assurances
of
their
welfare
and
endeavoured
,
by
dwelling
on
these
*NL*
subjects
so
interesting
to
my
heart
,
to
raise
my
desponding
spirits
;
*NL*
but
he
soon
felt
that
a
prison
can
not
be
the
abode
of
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
place
is
this
that
you
inhabit
,
my
son
!
''
said
he
,
looking
*NL*
mournfully
at
the
barred
windows
and
wretched
appearance
of
the
room
.
*NL*
``
You
travelled
to
seek
happiness
,
but
a
fatality
seems
to
pursue
you
.
*NL*
And
poor
Clerval
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
my
unfortunate
and
murdered
friend
was
an
agitation
too
*NL*
great
to
be
endured
in
my
weak
state
;
I
shed
tears
.
``
Alas
!
Yes
,
my
*NL*
father
,
''
replied
I
;
``
some
destiny
of
the
most
horrible
kind
hangs
over
*NL*
me
,
and
I
must
live
to
fulfil
it
,
or
surely
I
should
have
died
on
the
*NL*
coffin
of
Henry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
not
allowed
to
converse
for
any
length
of
time
,
for
the
*NL*
precarious
state
of
my
health
rendered
every
precaution
necessary
that
*NL*
could
ensure
tranquillity
.
Mr.
Kirwin
came
in
and
insisted
that
my
*NL*
strength
should
not
be
exhausted
by
too
much
exertion
.
But
the
*NL*
appearance
of
my
father
was
to
me
like
that
of
my
good
angel
,
and
I
*NL*
gradually
recovered
my
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
sickness
quitted
me
,
I
was
absorbed
by
a
gloomy
and
black
*NL*
melancholy
that
nothing
could
dissipate
.
The
image
of
Clerval
was
*NL*
forever
before
me
,
ghastly
and
murdered
.
More
than
once
the
agitation
*NL*
into
which
these
reflections
threw
me
made
my
friends
dread
a
dangerous
*NL*
relapse
.
Alas
!
Why
did
they
preserve
so
miserable
and
detested
a
*NL*
life
?
It
was
surely
that
I
might
fulfil
my
destiny
,
which
is
now
*NL*
drawing
to
a
close
.
Soon
,
oh
,
very
soon
,
will
death
extinguish
these
*NL*
throbbings
and
relieve
me
from
the
mighty
weight
of
anguish
that
bears
*NL*
me
to
the
dust
;
and
,
in
executing
the
award
of
justice
,
I
shall
also
*NL*
sink
to
rest
.
Then
the
appearance
of
death
was
distant
,
although
the
*NL*
wish
was
ever
present
to
my
thoughts
;
and
I
often
sat
for
hours
*NL*
motionless
and
speechless
,
wishing
for
some
mighty
revolution
that
*NL*
might
bury
me
and
my
destroyer
in
its
ruins
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
season
of
the
assizes
approached
.
I
had
already
been
three
months
*NL*
in
prison
,
and
although
I
was
still
weak
and
in
continual
danger
of
a
*NL*
relapse
,
I
was
obliged
to
travel
nearly
a
hundred
miles
to
the
country
*NL*
town
where
the
court
was
held
.
Mr.
Kirwin
charged
himself
with
every
*NL*
care
of
collecting
witnesses
and
arranging
my
defence
.
I
was
spared
*NL*
the
disgrace
of
appearing
publicly
as
a
criminal
,
as
the
case
was
not
*NL*
brought
before
the
court
that
decides
on
life
and
death
.
The
grand
*NL*
jury
rejected
the
bill
,
on
its
being
proved
that
I
was
on
the
Orkney
*NL*
Islands
at
the
hour
the
body
of
my
friend
was
found
;
and
a
fortnight
*NL*
after
my
removal
I
was
liberated
from
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
was
enraptured
on
finding
me
freed
from
the
vexations
of
a
*NL*
criminal
charge
,
that
I
was
again
allowed
to
breathe
the
fresh
*NL*
atmosphere
and
permitted
to
return
to
my
native
country
.
I
did
not
*NL*
participate
in
these
feelings
,
for
to
me
the
walls
of
a
dungeon
or
a
*NL*
palace
were
alike
hateful
.
The
cup
of
life
was
poisoned
forever
,
and
*NL*
although
the
sun
shone
upon
me
,
as
upon
the
happy
and
gay
of
heart
,
I
*NL*
saw
around
me
nothing
but
a
dense
and
frightful
darkness
,
penetrated
by
*NL*
no
light
but
the
glimmer
of
two
eyes
that
glared
upon
me
.
Sometimes
*NL*
they
were
the
expressive
eyes
of
Henry
,
languishing
in
death
,
the
dark
*NL*
orbs
nearly
covered
by
the
lids
and
the
long
black
lashes
that
fringed
*NL*
them
;
sometimes
it
was
the
watery
,
clouded
eyes
of
the
monster
,
as
I
*NL*
first
saw
them
in
my
chamber
at
Ingolstadt
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
tried
to
awaken
in
me
the
feelings
of
affection
.
He
talked
*NL*
of
Geneva
,
which
I
should
soon
visit
,
of
Elizabeth
and
Ernest
;
but
*NL*
these
words
only
drew
deep
groans
from
me
.
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
I
felt
a
*NL*
wish
for
happiness
and
thought
with
melancholy
delight
of
my
beloved
*NL*
cousin
or
longed
,
with
a
devouring
maladie
du
pays
,
to
see
once
more
*NL*
the
blue
lake
and
rapid
Rhone
,
that
had
been
so
dear
to
me
in
early
*NL*
childhood
;
but
my
general
state
of
feeling
was
a
torpor
in
which
a
*NL*
prison
was
as
welcome
a
residence
as
the
divinest
scene
in
nature
;
and
*NL*
these
fits
were
seldom
interrupted
but
by
paroxysms
of
anguish
and
*NL*
despair
.
At
these
moments
I
often
endeavoured
to
put
an
end
to
the
*NL*
existence
I
loathed
,
and
it
required
unceasing
attendance
and
vigilance
*NL*
to
restrain
me
from
committing
some
dreadful
act
of
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
one
duty
remained
to
me
,
the
recollection
of
which
finally
*NL*
triumphed
over
my
selfish
despair
.
It
was
necessary
that
I
should
*NL*
return
without
delay
to
Geneva
,
there
to
watch
over
the
lives
of
those
*NL*
I
so
fondly
loved
and
to
lie
in
wait
for
the
murderer
,
that
if
any
*NL*
chance
led
me
to
the
place
of
his
concealment
,
or
if
he
dared
again
to
*NL*
blast
me
by
his
presence
,
I
might
,
with
unfailing
aim
,
put
an
end
to
*NL*
the
existence
of
the
monstrous
image
which
I
had
endued
with
the
*NL*
mockery
of
a
soul
still
more
monstrous
.
My
father
still
desired
to
*NL*
delay
our
departure
,
fearful
that
I
could
not
sustain
the
fatigues
of
a
*NL*
journey
,
for
I
was
a
shattered
wreck
--
the
shadow
of
a
human
being
.
My
*NL*
strength
was
gone
.
I
was
a
mere
skeleton
,
and
fever
night
and
day
*NL*
preyed
upon
my
wasted
frame
.
Still
,
as
I
urged
our
leaving
Ireland
*NL*
with
such
inquietude
and
impatience
,
my
father
thought
it
best
to
*NL*
yield
.
We
took
our
passage
on
board
a
vessel
bound
for
Havre-de-Grace
*NL*
and
sailed
with
a
fair
wind
from
the
Irish
shores
.
It
was
midnight
.
I
*NL*
lay
on
the
deck
looking
at
the
stars
and
listening
to
the
dashing
of
*NL*
the
waves
.
I
hailed
the
darkness
that
shut
Ireland
from
my
sight
,
and
*NL*
my
pulse
beat
with
a
feverish
joy
when
I
reflected
that
I
should
soon
*NL*
see
Geneva
.
The
past
appeared
to
me
in
the
light
of
a
frightful
dream
;
*NL*
yet
the
vessel
in
which
I
was
,
the
wind
that
blew
me
from
the
detested
*NL*
shore
of
Ireland
,
and
the
sea
which
surrounded
me
told
me
too
forcibly
*NL*
that
I
was
deceived
by
no
vision
and
that
Clerval
,
my
friend
and
*NL*
dearest
companion
,
had
fallen
a
victim
to
me
and
the
monster
of
my
*NL*
creation
.
I
repassed
,
in
my
memory
,
my
whole
life
--
my
quiet
happiness
*NL*
while
residing
with
my
family
in
Geneva
,
the
death
of
my
mother
,
and
my
*NL*
departure
for
Ingolstadt
.
I
remembered
,
shuddering
,
the
mad
enthusiasm
*NL*
that
hurried
me
on
to
the
creation
of
my
hideous
enemy
,
and
I
called
to
*NL*
mind
the
night
in
which
he
first
lived
.
I
was
unable
to
pursue
the
*NL*
train
of
thought
;
a
thousand
feelings
pressed
upon
me
,
and
I
wept
*NL*
bitterly
.
Ever
since
my
recovery
from
the
fever
I
had
been
in
the
*NL*
custom
of
taking
every
night
a
small
quantity
of
laudanum
,
for
it
was
*NL*
by
means
of
this
drug
only
that
I
was
enabled
to
gain
the
rest
*NL*
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
life
.
Oppressed
by
the
recollection
*NL*
of
my
various
misfortunes
,
I
now
swallowed
double
my
usual
quantity
and
*NL*
soon
slept
profoundly
.
But
sleep
did
not
afford
me
respite
from
*NL*
thought
and
misery
;
my
dreams
presented
a
thousand
objects
that
scared
*NL*
me
.
Towards
morning
I
was
possessed
by
a
kind
of
nightmare
;
I
felt
the
*NL*
fiend
's
grasp
in
my
neck
and
could
not
free
myself
from
it
;
groans
and
*NL*
cries
rang
in
my
ears
.
My
father
,
who
was
watching
over
me
,
perceiving
*NL*
my
restlessness
,
awoke
me
;
the
dashing
waves
were
around
,
the
cloudy
*NL*
sky
above
,
the
fiend
was
not
here
:
a
sense
of
security
,
a
feeling
that
*NL*
a
truce
was
established
between
the
present
hour
and
the
irresistible
,
*NL*
disastrous
future
imparted
to
me
a
kind
of
calm
forgetfulness
,
of
which
*NL*
the
human
mind
is
by
its
structure
peculiarly
susceptible
.

The
voyage
came
to
an
end
.
We
landed
,
and
proceeded
to
Paris
.
I
soon
*NL*
found
that
I
had
overtaxed
my
strength
and
that
I
must
repose
before
I
*NL*
could
continue
my
journey
.
My
father
's
care
and
attentions
were
*NL*
indefatigable
,
but
he
did
not
know
the
origin
of
my
sufferings
and
*NL*
sought
erroneous
methods
to
remedy
the
incurable
ill
.
He
wished
me
to
*NL*
seek
amusement
in
society
.
I
abhorred
the
face
of
man
.
Oh
,
not
*NL*
abhorred
!
They
were
my
brethren
,
my
fellow
beings
,
and
I
felt
*NL*
attracted
even
to
the
most
repulsive
among
them
,
as
to
creatures
of
an
*NL*
angelic
nature
and
celestial
mechanism
.
But
I
felt
that
I
had
no
right
*NL*
to
share
their
intercourse
.
I
had
unchained
an
enemy
among
them
whose
*NL*
joy
it
was
to
shed
their
blood
and
to
revel
in
their
groans
.
How
they
*NL*
would
,
each
and
all
,
abhor
me
and
hunt
me
from
the
world
did
they
know
*NL*
my
unhallowed
acts
and
the
crimes
which
had
their
source
in
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
yielded
at
length
to
my
desire
to
avoid
society
and
strove
by
*NL*
various
arguments
to
banish
my
despair
.
Sometimes
he
thought
that
I
*NL*
felt
deeply
the
degradation
of
being
obliged
to
answer
a
charge
of
*NL*
murder
,
and
he
endeavoured
to
prove
to
me
the
futility
of
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
My
father
,
''
said
I
,
``
how
little
do
you
know
me
.
Human
beings
,
*NL*
their
feelings
and
passions
,
would
indeed
be
degraded
if
such
a
wretch
*NL*
as
I
felt
pride
.
Justine
,
poor
unhappy
Justine
,
was
as
innocent
as
I
,
*NL*
and
she
suffered
the
same
charge
;
she
died
for
it
;
and
I
am
the
cause
*NL*
of
this
--
I
murdered
her
.
William
,
Justine
,
and
Henry
--
they
all
died
by
*NL*
my
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
had
often
,
during
my
imprisonment
,
heard
me
make
the
same
*NL*
assertion
;
when
I
thus
accused
myself
,
he
sometimes
seemed
to
desire
an
*NL*
explanation
,
and
at
others
he
appeared
to
consider
it
as
the
offspring
*NL*
of
delirium
,
and
that
,
during
my
illness
,
some
idea
of
this
kind
had
*NL*
presented
itself
to
my
imagination
,
the
remembrance
of
which
I
*NL*
preserved
in
my
convalescence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
avoided
explanation
and
maintained
a
continual
silence
concerning
the
*NL*
wretch
I
had
created
.
I
had
a
persuasion
that
I
should
be
supposed
*NL*
mad
,
and
this
in
itself
would
forever
have
chained
my
tongue
.
But
,
*NL*
besides
,
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
disclose
a
secret
which
would
fill
*NL*
my
hearer
with
consternation
and
make
fear
and
unnatural
horror
the
*NL*
inmates
of
his
breast
.
I
checked
,
therefore
,
my
impatient
thirst
for
*NL*
sympathy
and
was
silent
when
I
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
*NL*
confided
the
fatal
secret
.
Yet
,
still
,
words
like
those
I
have
*NL*
recorded
would
burst
uncontrollably
from
me
.
I
could
offer
no
*NL*
explanation
of
them
,
but
their
truth
in
part
relieved
the
burden
of
my
*NL*
mysterious
woe
.
Upon
this
occasion
my
father
said
,
with
an
expression
*NL*
of
unbounded
wonder
,
``
My
dearest
Victor
,
what
infatuation
is
this
?
My
*NL*
dear
son
,
I
entreat
you
never
to
make
such
an
assertion
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
mad
,
''
I
cried
energetically
;
``
the
sun
and
the
heavens
,
who
*NL*
have
viewed
my
operations
,
can
bear
witness
of
my
truth
.
I
am
the
*NL*
assassin
of
those
most
innocent
victims
;
they
died
by
my
machinations
.
*NL*
A
thousand
times
would
I
have
shed
my
own
blood
,
drop
by
drop
,
to
have
*NL*
saved
their
lives
;
but
I
could
not
,
my
father
,
indeed
I
could
not
*NL*
sacrifice
the
whole
human
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conclusion
of
this
speech
convinced
my
father
that
my
ideas
were
*NL*
deranged
,
and
he
instantly
changed
the
subject
of
our
conversation
and
*NL*
endeavoured
to
alter
the
course
of
my
thoughts
.
He
wished
as
much
as
*NL*
possible
to
obliterate
the
memory
of
the
scenes
that
had
taken
place
in
*NL*
Ireland
and
never
alluded
to
them
or
suffered
me
to
speak
of
my
*NL*
misfortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
time
passed
away
I
became
more
calm
;
misery
had
her
dwelling
in
my
*NL*
heart
,
but
I
no
longer
talked
in
the
same
incoherent
manner
of
my
own
*NL*
crimes
;
sufficient
for
me
was
the
consciousness
of
them
.
By
the
utmost
*NL*
self-violence
I
curbed
the
imperious
voice
of
wretchedness
,
which
*NL*
sometimes
desired
to
declare
itself
to
the
whole
world
,
and
my
manners
*NL*
were
calmer
and
more
composed
than
they
had
ever
been
since
my
journey
*NL*
to
the
sea
of
ice
.
A
few
days
before
we
left
Paris
on
our
way
to
*NL*
Switzerland
,
I
received
the
following
letter
from
Elizabeth
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Friend
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gave
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
receive
a
letter
from
my
uncle
*NL*
dated
at
Paris
;
you
are
no
longer
at
a
formidable
distance
,
and
I
may
*NL*
hope
to
see
you
in
less
than
a
fortnight
.
My
poor
cousin
,
how
much
you
*NL*
must
have
suffered
!
I
expect
to
see
you
looking
even
more
ill
than
*NL*
when
you
quitted
Geneva
.
This
winter
has
been
passed
most
miserably
,
*NL*
tortured
as
I
have
been
by
anxious
suspense
;
yet
I
hope
to
see
peace
in
*NL*
your
countenance
and
to
find
that
your
heart
is
not
totally
void
of
*NL*
comfort
and
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
fear
that
the
same
feelings
now
exist
that
made
you
so
miserable
*NL*
a
year
ago
,
even
perhaps
augmented
by
time
.
I
would
not
disturb
you
at
*NL*
this
period
,
when
so
many
misfortunes
weigh
upon
you
,
but
a
*NL*
conversation
that
I
had
with
my
uncle
previous
to
his
departure
renders
*NL*
some
explanation
necessary
before
we
meet
.
Explanation
!
You
may
*NL*
possibly
say
,
What
can
Elizabeth
have
to
explain
?
If
you
really
say
*NL*
this
,
my
questions
are
answered
and
all
my
doubts
satisfied
.
But
you
*NL*
are
distant
from
me
,
and
it
is
possible
that
you
may
dread
and
yet
be
*NL*
pleased
with
this
explanation
;
and
in
a
probability
of
this
being
the
*NL*
case
,
I
dare
not
any
longer
postpone
writing
what
,
during
your
absence
,
*NL*
I
have
often
wished
to
express
to
you
but
have
never
had
the
courage
to
*NL*
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
well
know
,
Victor
,
that
our
union
had
been
the
favourite
plan
of
*NL*
your
parents
ever
since
our
infancy
.
We
were
told
this
when
young
,
and
*NL*
taught
to
look
forward
to
it
as
an
event
that
would
certainly
take
*NL*
place
.
We
were
affectionate
playfellows
during
childhood
,
and
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
dear
and
valued
friends
to
one
another
as
we
grew
older
.
But
*NL*
as
brother
and
sister
often
entertain
a
lively
affection
towards
each
*NL*
other
without
desiring
a
more
intimate
union
,
may
not
such
also
be
our
*NL*
case
?
Tell
me
,
dearest
Victor
.
Answer
me
,
I
conjure
you
by
our
mutual
*NL*
happiness
,
with
simple
truth
--
Do
you
not
love
another
?

You
have
travelled

you
have
spent
several
years
of
your
life
at
*NL*
Ingolstadt

and
I
confess
to
you
,
my
friend
,
that
when
I
saw
you
last
*NL*
autumn
so
unhappy
,
flying
to
solitude
from
the
society
of
every
*NL*
creature
,
I
could
not
help
supposing
that
you
might
regret
our
*NL*
connection
and
believe
yourself
bound
in
honour
to
fulfil
the
wishes
of
*NL*
your
parents
,
although
they
opposed
themselves
to
your
inclinations
.
*NL*
But
this
is
false
reasoning

I
confess
to
you
,
my
friend
,
that
I
love
*NL*
you
and
that
in
my
airy
dreams
of
futurity
you
have
been
my
constant
*NL*
friend
and
companion
.
But
it
is
your
happiness
I
desire
as
well
as
my
*NL*
own
when
I
declare
to
you
that
our
marriage
would
render
me
eternally
*NL*
miserable
unless
it
were
the
dictate
of
your
own
free
choice
.
Even
now
*NL*
I
weep
to
think
that
,
borne
down
as
you
are
by
the
cruellest
*NL*
misfortunes
,
you
may
stifle
,
by
the
word
`
honour
,
'
all
hope
of
that
*NL*
love
and
happiness
which
would
alone
restore
you
to
yourself
.
I
,
who
*NL*
have
so
disinterested
an
affection
for
you
,
may
increase
your
miseries
*NL*
tenfold
by
being
an
obstacle
to
your
wishes
.
Ah
!
Victor
,
be
assured
*NL*
that
your
cousin
and
playmate
has
too
sincere
a
love
for
you
not
to
be
*NL*
made
miserable
by
this
supposition
.
Be
happy
,
my
friend
;
and
if
you
*NL*
obey
me
in
this
one
request
,
remain
satisfied
that
nothing
on
earth
*NL*
will
have
the
power
to
interrupt
my
tranquillity

This

revived
in
my

what
I
had
before
forgotten

the
*NL*
threat
of
the
fiend
--
``
I
WILL
BE
WITH

Such

my
sentence

on

would

employ

*NL*
destroy

and
tear
me
from
the
glimpse

happiness
which
promised
*NL*
partly
to
console
my
sufferings

On
that
night
he
had
determined
to
*NL*
consummate
his
crimes
by
my
death

Well

be

a
deadly

then

victorious
I

his

over
me
be
at
an
end
.
If
he
were
*NL*
vanquished
,
I
should
be
a
free
man
.
Alas
!
What
freedom
?
Such
as
the
*NL*
peasant
enjoys
when
his
family
have
been
massacred
before
his
eyes
,
his
*NL*
cottage
burnt
,
his
lands
laid
waste
,
and
he
is
turned
adrift
,
homeless
,
*NL*
penniless
,
and
alone
,
but
free
.
Such
would
be
my
liberty
except
that
in
*NL*
my
Elizabeth
I
possessed
a
treasure
,
alas
,
balanced
by
those
horrors
of
*NL*
remorse
and
guilt
which
would
pursue
me
until
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sweet
and
beloved
Elizabeth
!
I
read
and
reread
her
letter
,
and
some
*NL*
softened
feelings
stole
into
my
heart
and
dared
to
whisper
paradisiacal
*NL*
dreams
of
love
and
joy
;
but
the
apple
was
already
eaten
,
and
the
*NL*
angel
's
arm
bared
to
drive
me
from
all
hope
.
Yet
I
would
die
to
make
*NL*
her
happy
.
If
the
monster
executed
his
threat
,
death
was
inevitable
;
*NL*
yet
,
again
,
I
considered
whether
my
marriage
would
hasten
my
fate
.
My
*NL*
destruction
might
indeed
arrive
a
few
months
sooner
,
but
if
my
torturer
*NL*
should
suspect
that
I
postponed
it
,
influenced
by
his
menaces
,
he
would
*NL*
surely
find
other
and
perhaps
more
dreadful
means
of
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
vowed
TO
BE
WITH
ME
ON
MY
WEDDING-NIGHT
,
yet
he
did
not
consider
*NL*
that
threat
as
binding
him
to
peace
in
the
meantime
,
for
as
if
to
show
*NL*
me
that
he
was
not
yet
satiated
with
blood
,
he
had
murdered
Clerval
*NL*
immediately
after
the
enunciation
of
his
threats
.
I
resolved
,
*NL*
therefore
,
that
if
my
immediate
union
with
my
cousin
would
conduce
*NL*
either
to
hers
or
my
father
's
happiness
,
my
adversary
's
designs
against
*NL*
my
life
should
not
retard
it
a
single
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
mind
I
wrote
to
Elizabeth
.
My
letter
was
calm
and
*NL*
affectionate
.
``
I
fear
,
my
beloved
girl
,
''
I
said
,
``
little
happiness
*NL*
remains
for
us
on
earth
;
yet
all
that
I
may
one
day
enjoy
is
centred
in
*NL*
you
.
Chase
away
your
idle
fears
;
to
you
alone
do
I
consecrate
my
life
*NL*
and
my
endeavours
for
contentment
.
I
have
one
secret
,
Elizabeth
,
a
*NL*
dreadful
one
;
when
revealed
to
you
,
it
will
chill
your
frame
with
*NL*
horror
,
and
then
,
far
from
being
surprised
at
my
misery
,
you
will
only
*NL*
wonder
that
I
survive
what
I
have
endured
.
I
will
confide
this
tale
of
*NL*
misery
and
terror
to
you
the
day
after
our
marriage
shall
take
place
,
*NL*
for
,
my
sweet
cousin
,
there
must
be
perfect
confidence
between
us
.
But
*NL*
until
then
,
I
conjure
you
,
do
not
mention
or
allude
to
it
.
This
I
most
*NL*
earnestly
entreat
,
and
I
know
you
will
comply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
a
week
after
the
arrival
of
Elizabeth
's
letter
we
returned
to
*NL*
Geneva
.
The
sweet
girl
welcomed
me
with
warm
affection
,
yet
tears
were
*NL*
in
her
eyes
as
she
beheld
my
emaciated
frame
and
feverish
cheeks
.
I
*NL*
saw
a
change
in
her
also
.
She
was
thinner
and
had
lost
much
of
that
*NL*
heavenly
vivacity
that
had
before
charmed
me
;
but
her
gentleness
and
*NL*
soft
looks
of
compassion
made
her
a
more
fit
companion
for
one
blasted
*NL*
and
miserable
as
I
was
.
The
tranquillity
which
I
now
enjoyed
did
not
*NL*
endure
.
Memory
brought
madness
with
it
,
and
when
I
thought
of
what
had
*NL*
passed
,
a
real
insanity
possessed
me
;
sometimes
I
was
furious
and
burnt
*NL*
with
rage
,
sometimes
low
and
despondent
.
I
neither
spoke
nor
looked
at
*NL*
anyone
,
but
sat
motionless
,
bewildered
by
the
multitude
of
miseries
*NL*
that
overcame
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
alone
had
the
power
to
draw
me
from
these
fits
;
her
gentle
*NL*
voice
would
soothe
me
when
transported
by
passion
and
inspire
me
with
*NL*
human
feelings
when
sunk
in
torpor
.
She
wept
with
me
and
for
me
.
When
*NL*
reason
returned
,
she
would
remonstrate
and
endeavour
to
inspire
me
with
*NL*
resignation
.
Ah
!
It
is
well
for
the
unfortunate
to
be
resigned
,
but
*NL*
for
the
guilty
there
is
no
peace
.
The
agonies
of
remorse
poison
the
*NL*
luxury
there
is
otherwise
sometimes
found
in
indulging
the
excess
of
*NL*
grief
.
Soon
after
my
arrival
my
father
spoke
of
my
immediate
marriage
*NL*
with
Elizabeth
.
I
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
,
then
,
some
other
attachment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
on
earth
.
I
love
Elizabeth
and
look
forward
to
our
union
with
*NL*
delight
.
Let
the
day
therefore
be
fixed
;
and
on
it
I
will
consecrate
*NL*
myself
,
in
life
or
death
,
to
the
happiness
of
my
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Victor
,
do
not
speak
thus
.
Heavy
misfortunes
have
befallen
*NL*
us
,
but
let
us
only
cling
closer
to
what
remains
and
transfer
our
love
*NL*
for
those
whom
we
have
lost
to
those
who
yet
live
.
Our
circle
will
be
*NL*
small
but
bound
close
by
the
ties
of
affection
and
mutual
misfortune
.
*NL*
And
when
time
shall
have
softened
your
despair
,
new
and
dear
objects
of
*NL*
care
will
be
born
to
replace
those
of
whom
we
have
been
so
cruelly
*NL*
deprived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
lessons
of
my
father
.
But
to
me
the
remembrance
of
the
*NL*
threat
returned
;
nor
can
you
wonder
that
,
omnipotent
as
the
fiend
had
*NL*
yet
been
in
his
deeds
of
blood
,
I
should
almost
regard
him
as
*NL*
invincible
,
and
that
when
he
had
pronounced
the
words
``
I
SHALL
BE
WITH
*NL*
YOU
ON
YOUR
WEDDING-NIGHT
,
''
I
should
regard
the
threatened
fate
as
*NL*
unavoidable
.
But
death
was
no
evil
to
me
if
the
loss
of
Elizabeth
were
*NL*
balanced
with
it
,
and
I
therefore
,
with
a
contented
and
even
cheerful
*NL*
countenance
,
agreed
with
my
father
that
if
my
cousin
would
consent
,
the
*NL*
ceremony
should
take
place
in
ten
days
,
and
thus
put
,
as
I
imagined
,
*NL*
the
seal
to
my
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
God
!
If
for
one
instant
I
had
thought
what
might
be
the
hellish
*NL*
intention
of
my
fiendish
adversary
,
I
would
rather
have
banished
myself
*NL*
forever
from
my
native
country
and
wandered
a
friendless
outcast
over
*NL*
the
earth
than
have
consented
to
this
miserable
marriage
.
But
,
as
if
*NL*
possessed
of
magic
powers
,
the
monster
had
blinded
me
to
his
real
*NL*
intentions
;
and
when
I
thought
that
I
had
prepared
only
my
own
death
,
I
*NL*
hastened
that
of
a
far
dearer
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
period
fixed
for
our
marriage
drew
nearer
,
whether
from
*NL*
cowardice
or
a
prophetic
feeling
,
I
felt
my
heart
sink
within
me
.
But
*NL*
I
concealed
my
feelings
by
an
appearance
of
hilarity
that
brought
*NL*
smiles
and
joy
to
the
countenance
of
my
father
,
but
hardly
deceived
the
*NL*
ever-watchful
and
nicer
eye
of
Elizabeth
.
She
looked
forward
to
our
*NL*
union
with
placid
contentment
,
not
unmingled
with
a
little
fear
,
which
*NL*
past
misfortunes
had
impressed
,
that
what
now
appeared
certain
and
*NL*
tangible
happiness
might
soon
dissipate
into
an
airy
dream
and
leave
no
*NL*
trace
but
deep
and
everlasting
regret
.
Preparations
were
made
for
the
*NL*
event
,
congratulatory
visits
were
received
,
and
all
wore
a
smiling
*NL*
appearance
.
I
shut
up
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
in
my
own
heart
the
anxiety
*NL*
that
preyed
there
and
entered
with
seeming
earnestness
into
the
plans
*NL*
of
my
father
,
although
they
might
only
serve
as
the
decorations
of
my
*NL*
tragedy
.
Through
my
father
's
exertions
a
part
of
the
inheritance
of
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
been
restored
to
her
by
the
Austrian
government
.
A
small
*NL*
possession
on
the
shores
of
Como
belonged
to
her
.
It
was
agreed
that
,
*NL*
immediately
after
our
union
,
we
should
proceed
to
Villa
Lavenza
and
*NL*
spend
our
first
days
of
happiness
beside
the
beautiful
lake
near
which
*NL*
it
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
I
took
every
precaution
to
defend
my
person
in
case
the
*NL*
fiend
should
openly
attack
me
.
I
carried
pistols
and
a
dagger
*NL*
constantly
about
me
and
was
ever
on
the
watch
to
prevent
artifice
,
and
*NL*
by
these
means
gained
a
greater
degree
of
tranquillity
.
Indeed
,
as
the
*NL*
period
approached
,
the
threat
appeared
more
as
a
delusion
,
not
to
be
*NL*
regarded
as
worthy
to
disturb
my
peace
,
while
the
happiness
I
hoped
for
*NL*
in
my
marriage
wore
a
greater
appearance
of
certainty
as
the
day
fixed
*NL*
for
its
solemnization
drew
nearer
and
I
heard
it
continually
spoken
of
*NL*
as
an
occurrence
which
no
accident
could
possibly
prevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
seemed
happy
;
my
tranquil
demeanour
contributed
greatly
to
*NL*
calm
her
mind
.
But
on
the
day
that
was
to
fulfil
my
wishes
and
my
*NL*
destiny
,
she
was
melancholy
,
and
a
presentiment
of
evil
pervaded
her
;
*NL*
and
perhaps
also
she
thought
of
the
dreadful
secret
which
I
had
*NL*
promised
to
reveal
to
her
on
the
following
day
.
My
father
was
in
the
*NL*
meantime
overjoyed
and
in
the
bustle
of
preparation
only
recognized
in
*NL*
the
melancholy
of
his
niece
the
diffidence
of
a
bride
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
ceremony
was
performed
a
large
party
assembled
at
my
*NL*
father
's
,
but
it
was
agreed
that
Elizabeth
and
I
should
commence
our
*NL*
journey
by
water
,
sleeping
that
night
at
Evian
and
continuing
our
*NL*
voyage
on
the
following
day
.
The
day
was
fair
,
the
wind
favourable
;
*NL*
all
smiled
on
our
nuptial
embarkation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
were
the
last
moments
of
my
life
during
which
I
enjoyed
the
*NL*
feeling
of
happiness
.
We
passed
rapidly
along
;
the
sun
was
hot
,
but
we
*NL*
were
sheltered
from
its
rays
by
a
kind
of
canopy
while
we
enjoyed
the
*NL*
beauty
of
the
scene
,
sometimes
on
one
side
of
the
lake
,
where
we
saw
*NL*
Mont
Saleve
,
the
pleasant
banks
of
Montalegre
,
and
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
surmounting
all
,
the
beautiful
Mont
Blanc
and
the
assemblage
of
snowy
*NL*
mountains
that
in
vain
endeavour
to
emulate
her
;
sometimes
coasting
the
*NL*
opposite
banks
,
we
saw
the
mighty
Jura
opposing
its
dark
side
to
the
*NL*
ambition
that
would
quit
its
native
country
,
and
an
almost
*NL*
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
invader
who
should
wish
to
enslave
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
hand
of
Elizabeth
.
``
You
are
sorrowful
,
my
love
.
Ah
!
If
*NL*
you
knew
what
I
have
suffered
and
what
I
may
yet
endure
,
you
would
*NL*
endeavour
to
let
me
taste
the
quiet
and
freedom
from
despair
that
this
*NL*
one
day
at
least
permits
me
to
enjoy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
happy
,
my
dear
Victor
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
;
``
there
is
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
nothing
to
distress
you
;
and
be
assured
that
if
a
lively
joy
is
not
*NL*
painted
in
my
face
,
my
heart
is
contented
.
Something
whispers
to
me
*NL*
not
to
depend
too
much
on
the
prospect
that
is
opened
before
us
,
but
I
*NL*
will
not
listen
to
such
a
sinister
voice
.
Observe
how
fast
we
move
*NL*
along
and
how
the
clouds
,
which
sometimes
obscure
and
sometimes
rise
*NL*
above
the
dome
of
Mont
Blanc
,
render
this
scene
of
beauty
still
more
*NL*
interesting
.
Look
also
at
the
innumerable
fish
that
are
swimming
in
*NL*
the
clear
waters
,
where
we
can
distinguish
every
pebble
that
lies
at
*NL*
the
bottom
.
What
a
divine
day
!
How
happy
and
serene
all
nature
*NL*
appears
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Elizabeth
endeavoured
to
divert
her
thoughts
and
mine
from
all
*NL*
reflection
upon
melancholy
subjects
.
But
her
temper
was
fluctuating
;
*NL*
joy
for
a
few
instants
shone
in
her
eyes
,
but
it
continually
gave
place
*NL*
to
distraction
and
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
sank
lower
in
the
heavens
;
we
passed
the
river
Drance
and
*NL*
observed
its
path
through
the
chasms
of
the
higher
and
the
glens
of
the
*NL*
lower
hills
.
The
Alps
here
come
closer
to
the
lake
,
and
we
approached
*NL*
the
amphitheatre
of
mountains
which
forms
its
eastern
boundary
.
The
*NL*
spire
of
Evian
shone
under
the
woods
that
surrounded
it
and
the
range
*NL*
of
mountain
above
mountain
by
which
it
was
overhung
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
,
which
had
hitherto
carried
us
along
with
amazing
rapidity
,
*NL*
sank
at
sunset
to
a
light
breeze
;
the
soft
air
just
ruffled
the
water
*NL*
and
caused
a
pleasant
motion
among
the
trees
as
we
approached
the
*NL*
shore
,
from
which
it
wafted
the
most
delightful
scent
of
flowers
and
*NL*
hay
.
The
sun
sank
beneath
the
horizon
as
we
landed
,
and
as
I
touched
*NL*
the
shore
I
felt
those
cares
and
fears
revive
which
soon
were
to
clasp
*NL*
me
and
cling
to
me
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
23
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
eight
o'clock
when
we
landed
;
we
walked
for
a
short
time
on
the
*NL*
shore
,
enjoying
the
transitory
light
,
and
then
retired
to
the
inn
and
*NL*
contemplated
the
lovely
scene
of
waters
,
woods
,
and
mountains
,
obscured
*NL*
in
darkness
,
yet
still
displaying
their
black
outlines
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
,
which
had
fallen
in
the
south
,
now
rose
with
great
violence
*NL*
in
the
west
.
The
moon
had
reached
her
summit
in
the
heavens
and
was
*NL*
beginning
to
descend
;
the
clouds
swept
across
it
swifter
than
the
*NL*
flight
of
the
vulture
and
dimmed
her
rays
,
while
the
lake
reflected
the
*NL*
scene
of
the
busy
heavens
,
rendered
still
busier
by
the
restless
waves
*NL*
that
were
beginning
to
rise
.
Suddenly
a
heavy
storm
of
rain
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
calm
during
the
day
,
but
so
soon
as
night
obscured
the
*NL*
shapes
of
objects
,
a
thousand
fears
arose
in
my
mind
.
I
was
anxious
*NL*
and
watchful
,
while
my
right
hand
grasped
a
pistol
which
was
hidden
in
*NL*
my
bosom
;
every
sound
terrified
me
,
but
I
resolved
that
I
would
sell
my
*NL*
life
dearly
and
not
shrink
from
the
conflict
until
my
own
life
or
that
*NL*
of
my
adversary
was
extinguished
.
Elizabeth
observed
my
agitation
for
*NL*
some
time
in
timid
and
fearful
silence
,
but
there
was
something
in
my
*NL*
glance
which
communicated
terror
to
her
,
and
trembling
,
she
asked
,
*NL*
``
What
is
it
that
agitates
you
,
my
dear
Victor
?
What
is
it
you
fear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Peace
,
peace
,
my
love
,
''
replied
I
;
``
this
night
,
and
all
will
be
*NL*
safe
;
but
this
night
is
dreadful
,
very
dreadful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
an
hour
in
this
state
of
mind
,
when
suddenly
I
reflected
how
*NL*
fearful
the
combat
which
I
momentarily
expected
would
be
to
my
wife
,
*NL*
and
I
earnestly
entreated
her
to
retire
,
resolving
not
to
join
her
*NL*
until
I
had
obtained
some
knowledge
as
to
the
situation
of
my
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
me
,
and
I
continued
some
time
walking
up
and
down
the
passages
*NL*
of
the
house
and
inspecting
every
corner
that
might
afford
a
retreat
to
*NL*
my
adversary
.
But
I
discovered
no
trace
of
him
and
was
beginning
to
*NL*
conjecture
that
some
fortunate
chance
had
intervened
to
prevent
the
*NL*
execution
of
his
menaces
when
suddenly
I
heard
a
shrill
and
dreadful
*NL*
scream
.
It
came
from
the
room
into
which
Elizabeth
had
retired
.
As
I
*NL*
heard
it
,
the
whole
truth
rushed
into
my
mind
,
my
arms
dropped
,
the
*NL*
motion
of
every
muscle
and
fibre
was
suspended
;
I
could
feel
the
blood
*NL*
trickling
in
my
veins
and
tingling
in
the
extremities
of
my
limbs
.
This
*NL*
state
lasted
but
for
an
instant
;
the
scream
was
repeated
,
and
I
rushed
*NL*
into
the
room
.
Great
God
!
Why
did
I
not
then
expire
!
Why
am
I
here
*NL*
to
relate
the
destruction
of
the
best
hope
and
the
purest
creature
on
*NL*
earth
?
She
was
there
,
lifeless
and
inanimate
,
thrown
across
the
bed
,
*NL*
her
head
hanging
down
and
her
pale
and
distorted
features
half
covered
*NL*
by
her
hair
.
Everywhere
I
turn
I
see
the
same
figure
--
her
bloodless
*NL*
arms
and
relaxed
form
flung
by
the
murderer
on
its
bridal
bier
.
Could
*NL*
I
behold
this
and
live
?
Alas
!
Life
is
obstinate
and
clings
closest
*NL*
where
it
is
most
hated
.
For
a
moment
only
did
I
lose
recollection
;
I
*NL*
fell
senseless
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
recovered
I
found
myself
surrounded
by
the
people
of
the
inn
;
*NL*
their
countenances
expressed
a
breathless
terror
,
but
the
horror
of
*NL*
others
appeared
only
as
a
mockery
,
a
shadow
of
the
feelings
that
*NL*
oppressed
me
.
I
escaped
from
them
to
the
room
where
lay
the
body
of
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
my
love
,
my
wife
,
so
lately
living
,
so
dear
,
so
worthy
.
She
*NL*
had
been
moved
from
the
posture
in
which
I
had
first
beheld
her
,
and
*NL*
now
,
as
she
lay
,
her
head
upon
her
arm
and
a
handkerchief
thrown
across
*NL*
her
face
and
neck
,
I
might
have
supposed
her
asleep
.
I
rushed
towards
*NL*
her
and
embraced
her
with
ardour
,
but
the
deadly
languor
and
coldness
*NL*
of
the
limbs
told
me
that
what
I
now
held
in
my
arms
had
ceased
to
be
*NL*
the
Elizabeth
whom
I
had
loved
and
cherished
.
The
murderous
mark
of
*NL*
the
fiend
's
grasp
was
on
her
neck
,
and
the
breath
had
ceased
to
issue
*NL*
from
her
lips
.
While
I
still
hung
over
her
in
the
agony
of
despair
,
I
*NL*
happened
to
look
up
.
The
windows
of
the
room
had
before
been
darkened
,
*NL*
and
I
felt
a
kind
of
panic
on
seeing
the
pale
yellow
light
of
the
moon
*NL*
illuminate
the
chamber
.
The
shutters
had
been
thrown
back
,
and
with
a
*NL*
sensation
of
horror
not
to
be
described
,
I
saw
at
the
open
window
a
*NL*
figure
the
most
hideous
and
abhorred
.
A
grin
was
on
the
face
of
the
*NL*
monster
;
he
seemed
to
jeer
,
as
with
his
fiendish
finger
he
pointed
*NL*
towards
the
corpse
of
my
wife
.
I
rushed
towards
the
window
,
and
*NL*
drawing
a
pistol
from
my
bosom
,
fired
;
but
he
eluded
me
,
leaped
from
*NL*
his
station
,
and
running
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
,
plunged
into
*NL*
the
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
report
of
the
pistol
brought
a
crowd
into
the
room
.
I
pointed
to
*NL*
the
spot
where
he
had
disappeared
,
and
we
followed
the
track
with
*NL*
boats
;
nets
were
cast
,
but
in
vain
.
After
passing
several
hours
,
we
*NL*
returned
hopeless
,
most
of
my
companions
believing
it
to
have
been
a
*NL*
form
conjured
up
by
my
fancy
.
After
having
landed
,
they
proceeded
to
*NL*
search
the
country
,
parties
going
in
different
directions
among
the
*NL*
woods
and
vines
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
attempted
to
accompany
them
and
proceeded
a
short
distance
from
the
*NL*
house
,
but
my
head
whirled
round
,
my
steps
were
like
those
of
a
drunken
*NL*
man
,
I
fell
at
last
in
a
state
of
utter
exhaustion
;
a
film
covered
my
*NL*
eyes
,
and
my
skin
was
parched
with
the
heat
of
fever
.
In
this
state
I
*NL*
was
carried
back
and
placed
on
a
bed
,
hardly
conscious
of
what
had
*NL*
happened
;
my
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
as
if
to
seek
something
that
*NL*
I
had
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
interval
I
arose
,
and
as
if
by
instinct
,
crawled
into
the
room
*NL*
where
the
corpse
of
my
beloved
lay
.
There
were
women
weeping
around
;
I
*NL*
hung
over
it
and
joined
my
sad
tears
to
theirs
;
all
this
time
no
*NL*
distinct
idea
presented
itself
to
my
mind
,
but
my
thoughts
rambled
to
*NL*
various
subjects
,
reflecting
confusedly
on
my
misfortunes
and
their
*NL*
cause
.
I
was
bewildered
,
in
a
cloud
of
wonder
and
horror
.
The
death
*NL*
of
William
,
the
execution
of
Justine
,
the
murder
of
Clerval
,
and
lastly
*NL*
of
my
wife
;
even
at
that
moment
I
knew
not
that
my
only
remaining
*NL*
friends
were
safe
from
the
malignity
of
the
fiend
;
my
father
even
now
*NL*
might
be
writhing
under
his
grasp
,
and
Ernest
might
be
dead
at
his
*NL*
feet
.
This
idea
made
me
shudder
and
recalled
me
to
action
.
I
started
*NL*
up
and
resolved
to
return
to
Geneva
with
all
possible
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
horses
to
be
procured
,
and
I
must
return
by
the
lake
;
but
*NL*
the
wind
was
unfavourable
,
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
.
However
,
it
*NL*
was
hardly
morning
,
and
I
might
reasonably
hope
to
arrive
by
night
.
I
*NL*
hired
men
to
row
and
took
an
oar
myself
,
for
I
had
always
experienced
*NL*
relief
from
mental
torment
in
bodily
exercise
.
But
the
overflowing
*NL*
misery
I
now
felt
,
and
the
excess
of
agitation
that
I
endured
rendered
*NL*
me
incapable
of
any
exertion
.
I
threw
down
the
oar
,
and
leaning
my
*NL*
head
upon
my
hands
,
gave
way
to
every
gloomy
idea
that
arose
.
If
I
*NL*
looked
up
,
I
saw
scenes
which
were
familiar
to
me
in
my
happier
time
*NL*
and
which
I
had
contemplated
but
the
day
before
in
the
company
of
her
*NL*
who
was
now
but
a
shadow
and
a
recollection
.
Tears
streamed
from
my
*NL*
eyes
.
The
rain
had
ceased
for
a
moment
,
and
I
saw
the
fish
play
in
the
*NL*
waters
as
they
had
done
a
few
hours
before
;
they
had
then
been
observed
*NL*
by
Elizabeth
.
Nothing
is
so
painful
to
the
human
mind
as
a
great
and
*NL*
sudden
change
.
The
sun
might
shine
or
the
clouds
might
lower
,
but
*NL*
nothing
could
appear
to
me
as
it
had
done
the
day
before
.
A
fiend
had
*NL*
snatched
from
me
every
hope
of
future
happiness
;
no
creature
had
ever
*NL*
been
so
miserable
as
I
was
;
so
frightful
an
event
is
single
in
the
*NL*
history
of
man
.
But
why
should
I
dwell
upon
the
incidents
that
followed
*NL*
this
last
overwhelming
event
?
Mine
has
been
a
tale
of
horrors
;
I
have
*NL*
reached
their
acme
,
and
what
I
must
now
relate
can
but
be
tedious
to
*NL*
you
.
Know
that
,
one
by
one
,
my
friends
were
snatched
away
;
I
was
left
*NL*
desolate
.
My
own
strength
is
exhausted
,
and
I
must
tell
,
in
a
few
*NL*
words
,
what
remains
of
my
hideous
narration
.
I
arrived
at
Geneva
.
My
*NL*
father
and
Ernest
yet
lived
,
but
the
former
sunk
under
the
tidings
that
*NL*
I
bore
.
I
see
him
now
,
excellent
and
venerable
old
man
!
His
eyes
*NL*
wandered
in
vacancy
,
for
they
had
lost
their
charm
and
their
*NL*
delight
--
his
Elizabeth
,
his
more
than
daughter
,
whom
he
doted
on
with
*NL*
all
that
affection
which
a
man
feels
,
who
in
the
decline
of
life
,
*NL*
having
few
affections
,
clings
more
earnestly
to
those
that
remain
.
*NL*
Cursed
,
cursed
be
the
fiend
that
brought
misery
on
his
grey
hairs
and
*NL*
doomed
him
to
waste
in
wretchedness
!
He
could
not
live
under
the
*NL*
horrors
that
were
accumulated
around
him
;
the
springs
of
existence
*NL*
suddenly
gave
way
;
he
was
unable
to
rise
from
his
bed
,
and
in
a
few
*NL*
days
he
died
in
my
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
then
became
of
me
?
I
know
not
;
I
lost
sensation
,
and
chains
and
*NL*
darkness
were
the
only
objects
that
pressed
upon
me
.
Sometimes
,
*NL*
indeed
,
I
dreamt
that
I
wandered
in
flowery
meadows
and
pleasant
vales
*NL*
with
the
friends
of
my
youth
,
but
I
awoke
and
found
myself
in
a
*NL*
dungeon
.
Melancholy
followed
,
but
by
degrees
I
gained
a
clear
*NL*
conception
of
my
miseries
and
situation
and
was
then
released
from
my
*NL*
prison
.
For
they
had
called
me
mad
,
and
during
many
months
,
as
I
*NL*
understood
,
a
solitary
cell
had
been
my
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Liberty
,
however
,
had
been
a
useless
gift
to
me
,
had
I
not
,
as
I
*NL*
awakened
to
reason
,
at
the
same
time
awakened
to
revenge
.
As
the
*NL*
memory
of
past
misfortunes
pressed
upon
me
,
I
began
to
reflect
on
their
*NL*
cause
--
the
monster
whom
I
had
created
,
the
miserable
daemon
whom
I
had
*NL*
sent
abroad
into
the
world
for
my
destruction
.
I
was
possessed
by
a
*NL*
maddening
rage
when
I
thought
of
him
,
and
desired
and
ardently
prayed
*NL*
that
I
might
have
him
within
my
grasp
to
wreak
a
great
and
signal
*NL*
revenge
on
his
cursed
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
my
hate
long
confine
itself
to
useless
wishes
;
I
began
to
*NL*
reflect
on
the
best
means
of
securing
him
;
and
for
this
purpose
,
about
*NL*
a
month
after
my
release
,
I
repaired
to
a
criminal
judge
in
the
town
*NL*
and
told
him
that
I
had
an
accusation
to
make
,
that
I
knew
the
*NL*
destroyer
of
my
family
,
and
that
I
required
him
to
exert
his
whole
*NL*
authority
for
the
apprehension
of
the
murderer
.
The
magistrate
*NL*
listened
to
me
with
attention
and
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
assured
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
no
pains
or
exertions
on
my
part
shall
be
*NL*
spared
to
discover
the
villain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
''
replied
I
;
``
listen
,
therefore
,
to
the
deposition
that
I
*NL*
have
to
make
.
It
is
indeed
a
tale
so
strange
that
I
should
fear
you
*NL*
would
not
credit
it
were
there
not
something
in
truth
which
,
however
*NL*
wonderful
,
forces
conviction
.
The
story
is
too
connected
to
be
*NL*
mistaken
for
a
dream
,
and
I
have
no
motive
for
falsehood
.
''
My
manner
as
*NL*
I
thus
addressed
him
was
impressive
but
calm
;
I
had
formed
in
my
own
*NL*
heart
a
resolution
to
pursue
my
destroyer
to
death
,
and
this
purpose
*NL*
quieted
my
agony
and
for
an
interval
reconciled
me
to
life
.
I
now
*NL*
related
my
history
briefly
but
with
firmness
and
precision
,
marking
the
*NL*
dates
with
accuracy
and
never
deviating
into
invective
or
exclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
magistrate
appeared
at
first
perfectly
incredulous
,
but
as
I
*NL*
continued
he
became
more
attentive
and
interested
;
I
saw
him
sometimes
*NL*
shudder
with
horror
;
at
others
a
lively
surprise
,
unmingled
with
*NL*
disbelief
,
was
painted
on
his
countenance
.
When
I
had
concluded
my
*NL*
narration
I
said
,
``
This
is
the
being
whom
I
accuse
and
for
whose
*NL*
seizure
and
punishment
I
call
upon
you
to
exert
your
whole
power
.
It
*NL*
is
your
duty
as
a
magistrate
,
and
I
believe
and
hope
that
your
feelings
*NL*
as
a
man
will
not
revolt
from
the
execution
of
those
functions
on
this
*NL*
occasion
.
''
This
address
caused
a
considerable
change
in
the
*NL*
physiognomy
of
my
own
auditor
.
He
had
heard
my
story
with
that
half
*NL*
kind
of
belief
that
is
given
to
a
tale
of
spirits
and
supernatural
*NL*
events
;
but
when
he
was
called
upon
to
act
officially
in
consequence
,
*NL*
the
whole
tide
of
his
incredulity
returned
.
He
,
however
,
answered
*NL*
mildly
,
``
I
would
willingly
afford
you
every
aid
in
your
pursuit
,
but
*NL*
the
creature
of
whom
you
speak
appears
to
have
powers
which
would
put
*NL*
all
my
exertions
to
defiance
.
Who
can
follow
an
animal
which
can
*NL*
traverse
the
sea
of
ice
and
inhabit
caves
and
dens
where
no
man
would
*NL*
venture
to
intrude
?
Besides
,
some
months
have
elapsed
since
the
*NL*
commission
of
his
crimes
,
and
no
one
can
conjecture
to
what
place
he
*NL*
has
wandered
or
what
region
he
may
now
inhabit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
doubt
that
he
hovers
near
the
spot
which
I
inhabit
,
and
if
he
*NL*
has
indeed
taken
refuge
in
the
Alps
,
he
may
be
hunted
like
the
chamois
*NL*
and
destroyed
as
a
beast
of
prey
.
But
I
perceive
your
thoughts
;
you
do
*NL*
not
credit
my
narrative
and
do
not
intend
to
pursue
my
enemy
with
the
*NL*
punishment
which
is
his
desert
.
''
As
I
spoke
,
rage
sparkled
in
my
eyes
;
*NL*
the
magistrate
was
intimidated
.
``
You
are
mistaken
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
will
*NL*
exert
myself
,
and
if
it
is
in
my
power
to
seize
the
monster
,
be
assured
*NL*
that
he
shall
suffer
punishment
proportionate
to
his
crimes
.
But
I
*NL*
fear
,
from
what
you
have
yourself
described
to
be
his
properties
,
that
*NL*
this
will
prove
impracticable
;
and
thus
,
while
every
proper
measure
is
*NL*
pursued
,
you
should
make
up
your
mind
to
disappointment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
can
not
be
;
but
all
that
I
can
say
will
be
of
little
avail
.
My
*NL*
revenge
is
of
no
moment
to
you
;
yet
,
while
I
allow
it
to
be
a
vice
,
I
*NL*
confess
that
it
is
the
devouring
and
only
passion
of
my
soul
.
My
rage
*NL*
is
unspeakable
when
I
reflect
that
the
murderer
,
whom
I
have
turned
*NL*
loose
upon
society
,
still
exists
.
You
refuse
my
just
demand
;
I
have
*NL*
but
one
resource
,
and
I
devote
myself
,
either
in
my
life
or
death
,
to
*NL*
his
destruction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
with
excess
of
agitation
as
I
said
this
;
there
was
a
frenzy
*NL*
in
my
manner
,
and
something
,
I
doubt
not
,
of
that
haughty
fierceness
*NL*
which
the
martyrs
of
old
are
said
to
have
possessed
.
But
to
a
Genevan
*NL*
magistrate
,
whose
mind
was
occupied
by
far
other
ideas
than
those
of
*NL*
devotion
and
heroism
,
this
elevation
of
mind
had
much
the
appearance
of
*NL*
madness
.
He
endeavoured
to
soothe
me
as
a
nurse
does
a
child
and
*NL*
reverted
to
my
tale
as
the
effects
of
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
,
''
I
cried
,
``
how
ignorant
art
thou
in
thy
pride
of
wisdom
!
Cease
;
*NL*
you
know
not
what
it
is
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
broke
from
the
house
angry
and
disturbed
and
retired
to
meditate
on
*NL*
some
other
mode
of
action
.

Chapter
24
*NL*
*NL*
My
present
situation
was
one
in
which
all
voluntary
thought
was
*NL*
swallowed
up
and
lost
.
I
was
hurried
away
by
fury
;
revenge
alone
*NL*
endowed
me
with
strength
and
composure
;
it
moulded
my
feelings
and
*NL*
allowed
me
to
be
calculating
and
calm
at
periods
when
otherwise
*NL*
delirium
or
death
would
have
been
my
portion
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
resolution
was
to
quit
Geneva
forever
;
my
country
,
which
,
when
*NL*
I
was
happy
and
beloved
,
was
dear
to
me
,
now
,
in
my
adversity
,
became
*NL*
hateful
.
I
provided
myself
with
a
sum
of
money
,
together
with
a
few
*NL*
jewels
which
had
belonged
to
my
mother
,
and
departed
.
And
now
my
*NL*
wanderings
began
which
are
to
cease
but
with
life
.
I
have
traversed
a
*NL*
vast
portion
of
the
earth
and
have
endured
all
the
hardships
which
*NL*
travellers
in
deserts
and
barbarous
countries
are
wont
to
meet
.
How
I
*NL*
have
lived
I
hardly
know
;
many
times
have
I
stretched
my
failing
limbs
*NL*
upon
the
sandy
plain
and
prayed
for
death
.
But
revenge
kept
me
alive
;
*NL*
I
dared
not
die
and
leave
my
adversary
in
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
quitted
Geneva
my
first
labour
was
to
gain
some
clue
by
which
I
*NL*
might
trace
the
steps
of
my
fiendish
enemy
.
But
my
plan
was
unsettled
,
*NL*
and
I
wandered
many
hours
round
the
confines
of
the
town
,
uncertain
*NL*
what
path
I
should
pursue
.
As
night
approached
I
found
myself
at
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
cemetery
where
William
,
Elizabeth
,
and
my
father
*NL*
reposed
.
I
entered
it
and
approached
the
tomb
which
marked
their
*NL*
graves
.
Everything
was
silent
except
the
leaves
of
the
trees
,
which
*NL*
were
gently
agitated
by
the
wind
;
the
night
was
nearly
dark
,
and
the
*NL*
scene
would
have
been
solemn
and
affecting
even
to
an
uninterested
*NL*
observer
.
The
spirits
of
the
departed
seemed
to
flit
around
and
to
*NL*
cast
a
shadow
,
which
was
felt
but
not
seen
,
around
the
head
of
the
*NL*
mourner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deep
grief
which
this
scene
had
at
first
excited
quickly
gave
way
*NL*
to
rage
and
despair
.
They
were
dead
,
and
I
lived
;
their
murderer
also
*NL*
lived
,
and
to
destroy
him
I
must
drag
out
my
weary
existence
.
I
knelt
*NL*
on
the
grass
and
kissed
the
earth
and
with
quivering
lips
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
By
the
sacred
earth
on
which
I
kneel
,
by
the
shades
that
wander
near
*NL*
me
,
by
the
deep
and
eternal
grief
that
I
feel
,
I
swear
;
and
by
thee
,
O
*NL*
Night
,
and
the
spirits
that
preside
over
thee
,
to
pursue
the
daemon
who
*NL*
caused
this
misery
,
until
he
or
I
shall
perish
in
mortal
conflict
.
For
*NL*
this
purpose
I
will
preserve
my
life
;
to
execute
this
dear
revenge
will
*NL*
I
again
behold
the
sun
and
tread
the
green
herbage
of
earth
,
which
*NL*
otherwise
should
vanish
from
my
eyes
forever
.
And
I
call
on
you
,
*NL*
spirits
of
the
dead
,
and
on
you
,
wandering
ministers
of
vengeance
,
to
*NL*
aid
and
conduct
me
in
my
work
.
Let
the
cursed
and
hellish
monster
*NL*
drink
deep
of
agony
;
let
him
feel
the
despair
that
now
torments
me
.
''
I
*NL*
had
begun
my
adjuration
with
solemnity
and
an
awe
which
almost
assured
*NL*
me
that
the
shades
of
my
murdered
friends
heard
and
approved
my
*NL*
devotion
,
but
the
furies
possessed
me
as
I
concluded
,
and
rage
choked
*NL*
my
utterance
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
answered
through
the
stillness
of
night
by
a
loud
and
fiendish
*NL*
laugh
.
It
rang
on
my
ears
long
and
heavily
;
the
mountains
re-echoed
*NL*
it
,
and
I
felt
as
if
all
hell
surrounded
me
with
mockery
and
laughter
.
*NL*
Surely
in
that
moment
I
should
have
been
possessed
by
frenzy
and
have
*NL*
destroyed
my
miserable
existence
but
that
my
vow
was
heard
and
that
I
*NL*
was
reserved
for
vengeance
.
The
laughter
died
away
,
when
a
well-known
*NL*
and
abhorred
voice
,
apparently
close
to
my
ear
,
addressed
me
in
an
*NL*
audible
whisper
,
``
I
am
satisfied
,
miserable
wretch
!
You
have
*NL*
determined
to
live
,
and
I
am
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
darted
towards
the
spot
from
which
the
sound
proceeded
,
but
the
devil
*NL*
eluded
my
grasp
.
Suddenly
the
broad
disk
of
the
moon
arose
and
shone
*NL*
full
upon
his
ghastly
and
distorted
shape
as
he
fled
with
more
than
*NL*
mortal
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pursued
him
,
and
for
many
months
this
has
been
my
task
.
Guided
by
a
*NL*
slight
clue
,
I
followed
the
windings
of
the
Rhone
,
but
vainly
.
The
*NL*
blue
Mediterranean
appeared
,
and
by
a
strange
chance
,
I
saw
the
fiend
*NL*
enter
by
night
and
hide
himself
in
a
vessel
bound
for
the
Black
Sea
.
I
*NL*
took
my
passage
in
the
same
ship
,
but
he
escaped
,
I
know
not
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amidst
the
wilds
of
Tartary
and
Russia
,
although
he
still
evaded
me
,
I
*NL*
have
ever
followed
in
his
track
.
Sometimes
the
peasants
,
scared
by
*NL*
this
horrid
apparition
,
informed
me
of
his
path
;
sometimes
he
himself
,
*NL*
who
feared
that
if
I
lost
all
trace
of
him
I
should
despair
and
die
,
*NL*
left
some
mark
to
guide
me
.
The
snows
descended
on
my
head
,
and
I
saw
*NL*
the
print
of
his
huge
step
on
the
white
plain
.
To
you
first
entering
*NL*
on
life
,
to
whom
care
is
new
and
agony
unknown
,
how
can
you
understand
*NL*
what
I
have
felt
and
still
feel
?
Cold
,
want
,
and
fatigue
were
the
*NL*
least
pains
which
I
was
destined
to
endure
;
I
was
cursed
by
some
devil
*NL*
and
carried
about
with
me
my
eternal
hell
;
yet
still
a
spirit
of
good
*NL*
followed
and
directed
my
steps
and
when
I
most
murmured
would
suddenly
*NL*
extricate
me
from
seemingly
insurmountable
difficulties
.
Sometimes
,
*NL*
when
nature
,
overcome
by
hunger
,
sank
under
the
exhaustion
,
a
repast
*NL*
was
prepared
for
me
in
the
desert
that
restored
and
inspirited
me
.
The
*NL*
fare
was
,
indeed
,
coarse
,
such
as
the
peasants
of
the
country
ate
,
but
*NL*
I
will
not
doubt
that
it
was
set
there
by
the
spirits
that
I
had
*NL*
invoked
to
aid
me
.
Often
,
when
all
was
dry
,
the
heavens
cloudless
,
and
*NL*
I
was
parched
by
thirst
,
a
slight
cloud
would
bedim
the
sky
,
shed
the
*NL*
few
drops
that
revived
me
,
and
vanish
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
,
when
I
could
,
the
courses
of
the
rivers
;
but
the
daemon
*NL*
generally
avoided
these
,
as
it
was
here
that
the
population
of
the
*NL*
country
chiefly
collected
.
In
other
places
human
beings
were
seldom
*NL*
seen
,
and
I
generally
subsisted
on
the
wild
animals
that
crossed
my
*NL*
path
.
I
had
money
with
me
and
gained
the
friendship
of
the
villagers
*NL*
by
distributing
it
;
or
I
brought
with
me
some
food
that
I
had
killed
,
*NL*
which
,
after
taking
a
small
part
,
I
always
presented
to
those
who
had
*NL*
provided
me
with
fire
and
utensils
for
cooking
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
life
,
as
it
passed
thus
,
was
indeed
hateful
to
me
,
and
it
was
during
*NL*
sleep
alone
that
I
could
taste
joy
.
O
blessed
sleep
!
Often
,
when
most
*NL*
miserable
,
I
sank
to
repose
,
and
my
dreams
lulled
me
even
to
rapture
.
*NL*
The
spirits
that
guarded
me
had
provided
these
moments
,
or
rather
*NL*
hours
,
of
happiness
that
I
might
retain
strength
to
fulfil
my
*NL*
pilgrimage
.
Deprived
of
this
respite
,
I
should
have
sunk
under
my
*NL*
hardships
.
During
the
day
I
was
sustained
and
inspirited
by
the
hope
*NL*
of
night
,
for
in
sleep
I
saw
my
friends
,
my
wife
,
and
my
beloved
*NL*
country
;
again
I
saw
the
benevolent
countenance
of
my
father
,
heard
the
*NL*
silver
tones
of
my
Elizabeth
's
voice
,
and
beheld
Clerval
enjoying
*NL*
health
and
youth
.
Often
,
when
wearied
by
a
toilsome
march
,
I
persuaded
*NL*
myself
that
I
was
dreaming
until
night
should
come
and
that
I
should
*NL*
then
enjoy
reality
in
the
arms
of
my
dearest
friends
.
What
agonizing
*NL*
fondness
did
I
feel
for
them
!
How
did
I
cling
to
their
dear
forms
,
as
*NL*
sometimes
they
haunted
even
my
waking
hours
,
and
persuade
myself
that
*NL*
they
still
lived
!
At
such
moments
vengeance
,
that
burned
within
me
,
*NL*
died
in
my
heart
,
and
I
pursued
my
path
towards
the
destruction
of
the
*NL*
daemon
more
as
a
task
enjoined
by
heaven
,
as
the
mechanical
impulse
of
*NL*
some
power
of
which
I
was
unconscious
,
than
as
the
ardent
desire
of
my
*NL*
soul
.
What
his
feelings
were
whom
I
pursued
I
can
not
know
.
Sometimes
,
*NL*
indeed
,
he
left
marks
in
writing
on
the
barks
of
the
trees
or
cut
in
*NL*
stone
that
guided
me
and
instigated
my
fury
.
``
My
reign
is
not
yet
*NL*
over
''
--
these
words
were
legible
in
one
of
these
inscriptions
--
``
you
*NL*
live
,
and
my
power
is
complete
.
Follow
me
;
I
seek
the
everlasting
ices
*NL*
of
the
north
,
where
you
will
feel
the
misery
of
cold
and
frost
,
to
*NL*
which
I
am
impassive
.
You
will
find
near
this
place
,
if
you
follow
not
*NL*
too
tardily
,
a
dead
hare
;
eat
and
be
refreshed
.
Come
on
,
my
enemy
;
we
*NL*
have
yet
to
wrestle
for
our
lives
,
but
many
hard
and
miserable
hours
*NL*
must
you
endure
until
that
period
shall
arrive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scoffing
devil
!
Again
do
I
vow
vengeance
;
again
do
I
devote
thee
,
*NL*
miserable
fiend
,
to
torture
and
death
.
Never
will
I
give
up
my
search
*NL*
until
he
or
I
perish
;
and
then
with
what
ecstasy
shall
I
join
my
*NL*
Elizabeth
and
my
departed
friends
,
who
even
now
prepare
for
me
the
*NL*
reward
of
my
tedious
toil
and
horrible
pilgrimage
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
still
pursued
my
journey
to
the
northward
,
the
snows
thickened
and
*NL*
the
cold
increased
in
a
degree
almost
too
severe
to
support
.
The
*NL*
peasants
were
shut
up
in
their
hovels
,
and
only
a
few
of
the
most
hardy
*NL*
ventured
forth
to
seize
the
animals
whom
starvation
had
forced
from
*NL*
their
hiding-places
to
seek
for
prey
.
The
rivers
were
covered
with
*NL*
ice
,
and
no
fish
could
be
procured
;
and
thus
I
was
cut
off
from
my
*NL*
chief
article
of
maintenance
.
The
triumph
of
my
enemy
increased
with
*NL*
the
difficulty
of
my
labours
.
One
inscription
that
he
left
was
in
*NL*
these
words
:
``
Prepare
!
Your
toils
only
begin
;
wrap
yourself
in
furs
*NL*
and
provide
food
,
for
we
shall
soon
enter
upon
a
journey
where
your
*NL*
sufferings
will
satisfy
my
everlasting
hatred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
courage
and
perseverance
were
invigorated
by
these
scoffing
words
;
I
*NL*
resolved
not
to
fail
in
my
purpose
,
and
calling
on
heaven
to
support
*NL*
me
,
I
continued
with
unabated
fervour
to
traverse
immense
deserts
,
*NL*
until
the
ocean
appeared
at
a
distance
and
formed
the
utmost
boundary
*NL*
of
the
horizon
.
Oh
!
How
unlike
it
was
to
the
blue
seasons
of
the
*NL*
south
!
Covered
with
ice
,
it
was
only
to
be
distinguished
from
land
by
*NL*
its
superior
wildness
and
ruggedness
.
The
Greeks
wept
for
joy
when
*NL*
they
beheld
the
Mediterranean
from
the
hills
of
Asia
,
and
hailed
with
*NL*
rapture
the
boundary
of
their
toils
.
I
did
not
weep
,
but
I
knelt
down
*NL*
and
with
a
full
heart
thanked
my
guiding
spirit
for
conducting
me
in
*NL*
safety
to
the
place
where
I
hoped
,
notwithstanding
my
adversary
's
gibe
,
*NL*
to
meet
and
grapple
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
weeks
before
this
period
I
had
procured
a
sledge
and
dogs
and
thus
*NL*
traversed
the
snows
with
inconceivable
speed
.
I
know
not
whether
the
*NL*
fiend
possessed
the
same
advantages
,
but
I
found
that
,
as
before
I
had
*NL*
daily
lost
ground
in
the
pursuit
,
I
now
gained
on
him
,
so
much
so
that
*NL*
when
I
first
saw
the
ocean
he
was
but
one
day
's
journey
in
advance
,
and
*NL*
I
hoped
to
intercept
him
before
he
should
reach
the
beach
.
With
new
*NL*
courage
,
therefore
,
I
pressed
on
,
and
in
two
days
arrived
at
a
wretched
*NL*
hamlet
on
the
seashore
.
I
inquired
of
the
inhabitants
concerning
the
*NL*
fiend
and
gained
accurate
information
.
A
gigantic
monster
,
they
said
,
*NL*
had
arrived
the
night
before
,
armed
with
a
gun
and
many
pistols
,
*NL*
putting
to
flight
the
inhabitants
of
a
solitary
cottage
through
fear
of
*NL*
his
terrific
appearance
.
He
had
carried
off
their
store
of
winter
*NL*
food
,
and
placing
it
in
a
sledge
,
to
draw
which
he
had
seized
on
a
*NL*
numerous
drove
of
trained
dogs
,
he
had
harnessed
them
,
and
the
same
*NL*
night
,
to
the
joy
of
the
horror-struck
villagers
,
had
pursued
his
*NL*
journey
across
the
sea
in
a
direction
that
led
to
no
land
;
and
they
*NL*
conjectured
that
he
must
speedily
be
destroyed
by
the
breaking
of
the
*NL*
ice
or
frozen
by
the
eternal
frosts
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
information
I
suffered
a
temporary
access
of
despair
.
*NL*
He
had
escaped
me
,
and
I
must
commence
a
destructive
and
almost
endless
*NL*
journey
across
the
mountainous
ices
of
the
ocean
,
amidst
cold
that
few
*NL*
of
the
inhabitants
could
long
endure
and
which
I
,
the
native
of
a
*NL*
genial
and
sunny
climate
,
could
not
hope
to
survive
.
Yet
at
the
idea
*NL*
that
the
fiend
should
live
and
be
triumphant
,
my
rage
and
vengeance
*NL*
returned
,
and
like
a
mighty
tide
,
overwhelmed
every
other
feeling
.
*NL*
After
a
slight
repose
,
during
which
the
spirits
of
the
dead
hovered
*NL*
round
and
instigated
me
to
toil
and
revenge
,
I
prepared
for
my
journey
.
*NL*
I
exchanged
my
land-sledge
for
one
fashioned
for
the
inequalities
of
*NL*
the
frozen
ocean
,
and
purchasing
a
plentiful
stock
of
provisions
,
I
*NL*
departed
from
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
guess
how
many
days
have
passed
since
then
,
but
I
have
endured
*NL*
misery
which
nothing
but
the
eternal
sentiment
of
a
just
retribution
*NL*
burning
within
my
heart
could
have
enabled
me
to
support
.
Immense
and
*NL*
rugged
mountains
of
ice
often
barred
up
my
passage
,
and
I
often
heard
*NL*
the
thunder
of
the
ground
sea
,
which
threatened
my
destruction
.
But
*NL*
again
the
frost
came
and
made
the
paths
of
the
sea
secure
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
quantity
of
provision
which
I
had
consumed
,
I
should
guess
that
*NL*
I
had
passed
three
weeks
in
this
journey
;
and
the
continual
protraction
*NL*
of
hope
,
returning
back
upon
the
heart
,
often
wrung
bitter
drops
of
*NL*
despondency
and
grief
from
my
eyes
.
Despair
had
indeed
almost
secured
*NL*
her
prey
,
and
I
should
soon
have
sunk
beneath
this
misery
.
Once
,
after
*NL*
the
poor
animals
that
conveyed
me
had
with
incredible
toil
gained
the
*NL*
summit
of
a
sloping
ice
mountain
,
and
one
,
sinking
under
his
fatigue
,
*NL*
died
,
I
viewed
the
expanse
before
me
with
anguish
,
when
suddenly
my
eye
*NL*
caught
a
dark
speck
upon
the
dusky
plain
.
I
strained
my
sight
to
*NL*
discover
what
it
could
be
and
uttered
a
wild
cry
of
ecstasy
when
I
*NL*
distinguished
a
sledge
and
the
distorted
proportions
of
a
well-known
*NL*
form
within
.
Oh
!
With
what
a
burning
gush
did
hope
revisit
my
heart
!
*NL*
Warm
tears
filled
my
eyes
,
which
I
hastily
wiped
away
,
that
they
might
*NL*
not
intercept
the
view
I
had
of
the
daemon
;
but
still
my
sight
was
*NL*
dimmed
by
the
burning
drops
,
until
,
giving
way
to
the
emotions
that
*NL*
oppressed
me
,
I
wept
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
the
time
for
delay
;
I
disencumbered
the
dogs
of
their
*NL*
dead
companion
,
gave
them
a
plentiful
portion
of
food
,
and
after
an
*NL*
hour
's
rest
,
which
was
absolutely
necessary
,
and
yet
which
was
bitterly
*NL*
irksome
to
me
,
I
continued
my
route
.
The
sledge
was
still
visible
,
nor
*NL*
did
I
again
lose
sight
of
it
except
at
the
moments
when
for
a
short
*NL*
time
some
ice-rock
concealed
it
with
its
intervening
crags
.
I
indeed
*NL*
perceptibly
gained
on
it
,
and
when
,
after
nearly
two
days
'
journey
,
I
*NL*
beheld
my
enemy
at
no
more
than
a
mile
distant
,
my
heart
bounded
within
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
when
I
appeared
almost
within
grasp
of
my
foe
,
my
hopes
were
*NL*
suddenly
extinguished
,
and
I
lost
all
trace
of
him
more
utterly
than
I
*NL*
had
ever
done
before
.
A
ground
sea
was
heard
;
the
thunder
of
its
*NL*
progress
,
as
the
waters
rolled
and
swelled
beneath
me
,
became
every
*NL*
moment
more
ominous
and
terrific
.
I
pressed
on
,
but
in
vain
.
The
wind
*NL*
arose
;
the
sea
roared
;
and
,
as
with
the
mighty
shock
of
an
earthquake
,
*NL*
it
split
and
cracked
with
a
tremendous
and
overwhelming
sound
.
The
*NL*
work
was
soon
finished
;
in
a
few
minutes
a
tumultuous
sea
rolled
*NL*
between
me
and
my
enemy
,
and
I
was
left
drifting
on
a
scattered
piece
*NL*
of
ice
that
was
continually
lessening
and
thus
preparing
for
me
a
*NL*
hideous
death
.
In
this
manner
many
appalling
hours
passed
;
several
of
*NL*
my
dogs
died
,
and
I
myself
was
about
to
sink
under
the
accumulation
of
*NL*
distress
when
I
saw
your
vessel
riding
at
anchor
and
holding
forth
to
*NL*
me
hopes
of
succour
and
life
.
I
had
no
conception
that
vessels
ever
*NL*
came
so
far
north
and
was
astounded
at
the
sight
.
I
quickly
destroyed
*NL*
part
of
my
sledge
to
construct
oars
,
and
by
these
means
was
enabled
,
*NL*
with
infinite
fatigue
,
to
move
my
ice
raft
in
the
direction
of
your
*NL*
ship
.
I
had
determined
,
if
you
were
going
southwards
,
still
to
trust
*NL*
myself
to
the
mercy
of
the
seas
rather
than
abandon
my
purpose
.
I
*NL*
hoped
to
induce
you
to
grant
me
a
boat
with
which
I
could
pursue
my
*NL*
enemy
.
But
your
direction
was
northwards
.
You
took
me
on
board
when
*NL*
my
vigour
was
exhausted
,
and
I
should
soon
have
sunk
under
my
*NL*
multiplied
hardships
into
a
death
which
I
still
dread
,
for
my
task
is
*NL*
unfulfilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
When
will
my
guiding
spirit
,
in
conducting
me
to
the
daemon
,
allow
*NL*
me
the
rest
I
so
much
desire
;
or
must
I
die
,
and
he
yet
live
?
If
I
do
,
*NL*
swear
to
me
,
Walton
,
that
he
shall
not
escape
,
that
you
will
seek
him
*NL*
and
satisfy
my
vengeance
in
his
death
.
And
do
I
dare
to
ask
of
you
to
*NL*
undertake
my
pilgrimage
,
to
endure
the
hardships
that
I
have
undergone
?
*NL*
No
;
I
am
not
so
selfish
.
Yet
,
when
I
am
dead
,
if
he
should
appear
,
if
*NL*
the
ministers
of
vengeance
should
conduct
him
to
you
,
swear
that
he
*NL*
shall
not
live
--
swear
that
he
shall
not
triumph
over
my
accumulated
*NL*
woes
and
survive
to
add
to
the
list
of
his
dark
crimes
.
He
is
eloquent
*NL*
and
persuasive
,
and
once
his
words
had
even
power
over
my
heart
;
but
*NL*
trust
him
not
.
His
soul
is
as
hellish
as
his
form
,
full
of
treachery
*NL*
and
fiend-like
malice
.
Hear
him
not
;
call
on
the
names
of
William
,
*NL*
Justine
,
Clerval
,
Elizabeth
,
my
father
,
and
of
the
wretched
Victor
,
and
*NL*
thrust
your
sword
into
his
heart
.
I
will
hover
near
and
direct
the
*NL*
steel
aright
.

*NL*
*NL*
August
26th
,
17
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
You
have
read
this
strange
and
terrific
story
,
Margaret
;
and
do
you
not
*NL*
feel
your
blood
congeal
with
horror
,
like
that
which
even
now
curdles
*NL*
mine
?
Sometimes
,
seized
with
sudden
agony
,
he
could
not
continue
his
*NL*
tale
;
at
others
,
his
voice
broken
,
yet
piercing
,
uttered
with
*NL*
difficulty
the
words
so
replete
with
anguish
.
His
fine
and
lovely
eyes
*NL*
were
now
lighted
up
with
indignation
,
now
subdued
to
downcast
sorrow
*NL*
and
quenched
in
infinite
wretchedness
.
Sometimes
he
commanded
his
*NL*
countenance
and
tones
and
related
the
most
horrible
incidents
with
a
*NL*
tranquil
voice
,
suppressing
every
mark
of
agitation
;
then
,
like
a
*NL*
volcano
bursting
forth
,
his
face
would
suddenly
change
to
an
expression
*NL*
of
the
wildest
rage
as
he
shrieked
out
imprecations
on
his
persecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tale
is
connected
and
told
with
an
appearance
of
the
simplest
*NL*
truth
,
yet
I
own
to
you
that
the
letters
of
Felix
and
Safie
,
which
he
*NL*
showed
me
,
and
the
apparition
of
the
monster
seen
from
our
ship
,
*NL*
brought
to
me
a
greater
conviction
of
the
truth
of
his
narrative
than
*NL*
his
asseverations
,
however
earnest
and
connected
.
Such
a
monster
has
,
*NL*
then
,
really
existence
!
I
can
not
doubt
it
,
yet
I
am
lost
in
surprise
*NL*
and
admiration
.
Sometimes
I
endeavoured
to
gain
from
Frankenstein
the
*NL*
particulars
of
his
creature
's
formation
,
but
on
this
point
he
was
*NL*
impenetrable
.
``
Are
you
mad
,
my
friend
?
''
said
he
.
``
Or
whither
does
your
*NL*
senseless
curiosity
lead
you
?
Would
you
also
create
for
yourself
and
*NL*
the
world
a
demoniacal
enemy
?
Peace
,
peace
!
Learn
my
miseries
and
do
*NL*
not
seek
to
increase
your
own
.
''
Frankenstein
discovered
that
I
made
*NL*
notes
concerning
his
history
;
he
asked
to
see
them
and
then
himself
*NL*
corrected
and
augmented
them
in
many
places
,
but
principally
in
giving
*NL*
the
life
and
spirit
to
the
conversations
he
held
with
his
enemy
.
``
Since
*NL*
you
have
preserved
my
narration
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
would
not
that
a
*NL*
mutilated
one
should
go
down
to
posterity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
has
a
week
passed
away
,
while
I
have
listened
to
the
strangest
*NL*
tale
that
ever
imagination
formed
.
My
thoughts
and
every
feeling
of
my
*NL*
soul
have
been
drunk
up
by
the
interest
for
my
guest
which
this
tale
*NL*
and
his
own
elevated
and
gentle
manners
have
created
.
I
wish
to
soothe
*NL*
him
,
yet
can
I
counsel
one
so
infinitely
miserable
,
so
destitute
of
*NL*
every
hope
of
consolation
,
to
live
?
Oh
,
no
!
The
only
joy
that
he
can
*NL*
now
know
will
be
when
he
composes
his
shattered
spirit
to
peace
and
*NL*
death
.
Yet
he
enjoys
one
comfort
,
the
offspring
of
solitude
and
*NL*
delirium
;
he
believes
that
when
in
dreams
he
holds
converse
with
his
*NL*
friends
and
derives
from
that
communion
consolation
for
his
miseries
or
*NL*
excitements
to
his
vengeance
,
that
they
are
not
the
creations
of
his
*NL*
fancy
,
but
the
beings
themselves
who
visit
him
from
the
regions
of
a
*NL*
remote
world
.
This
faith
gives
a
solemnity
to
his
reveries
that
render
*NL*
them
to
me
almost
as
imposing
and
interesting
as
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
conversations
are
not
always
confined
to
his
own
history
and
*NL*
misfortunes
.
On
every
point
of
general
literature
he
displays
*NL*
unbounded
knowledge
and
a
quick
and
piercing
apprehension
.
His
*NL*
eloquence
is
forcible
and
touching
;
nor
can
I
hear
him
,
when
he
relates
*NL*
a
pathetic
incident
or
endeavours
to
move
the
passions
of
pity
or
love
,
*NL*
without
tears
.
What
a
glorious
creature
must
he
have
been
in
the
days
*NL*
of
his
prosperity
,
when
he
is
thus
noble
and
godlike
in
ruin
!
He
seems
*NL*
to
feel
his
own
worth
and
the
greatness
of
his
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
younger
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
believed
myself
destined
for
some
great
*NL*
enterprise
.
My
feelings
are
profound
,
but
I
possessed
a
coolness
of
*NL*
judgment
that
fitted
me
for
illustrious
achievements
.
This
sentiment
*NL*
of
the
worth
of
my
nature
supported
me
when
others
would
have
been
*NL*
oppressed
,
for
I
deemed
it
criminal
to
throw
away
in
useless
grief
*NL*
those
talents
that
might
be
useful
to
my
fellow
creatures
.
When
I
*NL*
reflected
on
the
work
I
had
completed
,
no
less
a
one
than
the
creation
*NL*
of
a
sensitive
and
rational
animal
,
I
could
not
rank
myself
with
the
*NL*
herd
of
common
projectors
.
But
this
thought
,
which
supported
me
in
the
*NL*
commencement
of
my
career
,
now
serves
only
to
plunge
me
lower
in
the
*NL*
dust
.
All
my
speculations
and
hopes
are
as
nothing
,
and
like
the
*NL*
archangel
who
aspired
to
omnipotence
,
I
am
chained
in
an
eternal
hell
.
*NL*
My
imagination
was
vivid
,
yet
my
powers
of
analysis
and
application
*NL*
were
intense
;
by
the
union
of
these
qualities
I
conceived
the
idea
and
*NL*
executed
the
creation
of
a
man
.
Even
now
I
can
not
recollect
without
*NL*
passion
my
reveries
while
the
work
was
incomplete
.
I
trod
heaven
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
now
exulting
in
my
powers
,
now
burning
with
the
idea
of
their
*NL*
effects
.
From
my
infancy
I
was
imbued
with
high
hopes
and
a
lofty
*NL*
ambition
;
but
how
am
I
sunk
!
Oh
!
My
friend
,
if
you
had
known
me
as
I
*NL*
once
was
,
you
would
not
recognize
me
in
this
state
of
degradation
.
*NL*
Despondency
rarely
visited
my
heart
;
a
high
destiny
seemed
to
bear
me
*NL*
on
,
until
I
fell
,
never
,
never
again
to
rise
.
''
Must
I
then
lose
this
*NL*
admirable
being
?
I
have
longed
for
a
friend
;
I
have
sought
one
who
*NL*
would
sympathize
with
and
love
me
.
Behold
,
on
these
desert
seas
I
have
*NL*
found
such
a
one
,
but
I
fear
I
have
gained
him
only
to
know
his
value
*NL*
and
lose
him
.
I
would
reconcile
him
to
life
,
but
he
repulses
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
Walton
,
''
he
said
,
``
for
your
kind
intentions
towards
so
*NL*
miserable
a
wretch
;
but
when
you
speak
of
new
ties
and
fresh
*NL*
affections
,
think
you
that
any
can
replace
those
who
are
gone
?
Can
any
*NL*
man
be
to
me
as
Clerval
was
,
or
any
woman
another
Elizabeth
?
Even
*NL*
where
the
affections
are
not
strongly
moved
by
any
superior
excellence
,
*NL*
the
companions
of
our
childhood
always
possess
a
certain
power
over
our
*NL*
minds
which
hardly
any
later
friend
can
obtain
.
They
know
our
*NL*
infantine
dispositions
,
which
,
however
they
may
be
afterwards
modified
,
*NL*
are
never
eradicated
;
and
they
can
judge
of
our
actions
with
more
*NL*
certain
conclusions
as
to
the
integrity
of
our
motives
.
A
sister
or
a
*NL*
brother
can
never
,
unless
indeed
such
symptoms
have
been
shown
early
,
*NL*
suspect
the
other
of
fraud
or
false
dealing
,
when
another
friend
,
*NL*
however
strongly
he
may
be
attached
,
may
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
be
*NL*
contemplated
with
suspicion
.
But
I
enjoyed
friends
,
dear
not
only
*NL*
through
habit
and
association
,
but
from
their
own
merits
;
and
wherever
*NL*
I
am
,
the
soothing
voice
of
my
Elizabeth
and
the
conversation
of
*NL*
Clerval
will
be
ever
whispered
in
my
ear
.
They
are
dead
,
and
but
one
*NL*
feeling
in
such
a
solitude
can
persuade
me
to
preserve
my
life
.
If
I
*NL*
were
engaged
in
any
high
undertaking
or
design
,
fraught
with
extensive
*NL*
utility
to
my
fellow
creatures
,
then
could
I
live
to
fulfil
it
.
But
*NL*
such
is
not
my
destiny
;
I
must
pursue
and
destroy
the
being
to
whom
I
*NL*
gave
existence
;
then
my
lot
on
earth
will
be
fulfilled
and
I
may
die
.

*NL*
My
beloved
Sister
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
write
to
you
,
encompassed
by
peril
and
ignorant
whether
I
am
ever
*NL*
doomed
to
see
again
dear
England
and
the
dearer
friends
that
inhabit
*NL*
it
.
I
am
surrounded
by
mountains
of
ice
which
admit
of
no
escape
and
*NL*
threaten
every
moment
to
crush
my
vessel
.
The
brave
fellows
whom
I
*NL*
have
persuaded
to
be
my
companions
look
towards
me
for
aid
,
but
I
have
*NL*
none
to
bestow
.
There
is
something
terribly
appalling
in
our
*NL*
situation
,
yet
my
courage
and
hopes
do
not
desert
me
.
Yet
it
is
*NL*
terrible
to
reflect
that
the
lives
of
all
these
men
are
endangered
*NL*
through
me
.
If
we
are
lost
,
my
mad
schemes
are
the
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
,
Margaret
,
will
be
the
state
of
your
mind
?
You
will
not
hear
*NL*
of
my
destruction
,
and
you
will
anxiously
await
my
return
.
Years
will
*NL*
pass
,
and
you
will
have
visitings
of
despair
and
yet
be
tortured
by
*NL*
hope
.
Oh
!
My
beloved
sister
,
the
sickening
failing
of
your
heart-felt
*NL*
expectations
is
,
in
prospect
,
more
terrible
to
me
than
my
own
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
you
have
a
husband
and
lovely
children
;
you
may
be
happy
.
Heaven
*NL*
bless
you
and
make
you
so
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
unfortunate
guest
regards
me
with
the
tenderest
compassion
.
He
*NL*
endeavours
to
fill
me
with
hope
and
talks
as
if
life
were
a
possession
*NL*
which
he
valued
.
He
reminds
me
how
often
the
same
accidents
have
*NL*
happened
to
other
navigators
who
have
attempted
this
sea
,
and
in
spite
*NL*
of
myself
,
he
fills
me
with
cheerful
auguries
.
Even
the
sailors
feel
*NL*
the
power
of
his
eloquence
;
when
he
speaks
,
they
no
longer
despair
;
he
*NL*
rouses
their
energies
,
and
while
they
hear
his
voice
they
believe
these
*NL*
vast
mountains
of
ice
are
mole-hills
which
will
vanish
before
the
*NL*
resolutions
of
man
.
These
feelings
are
transitory
;
each
day
of
*NL*
expectation
delayed
fills
them
with
fear
,
and
I
almost
dread
a
mutiny
*NL*
caused
by
this
despair
.

September

*NL*
*NL*
A
scene
has
just
passed
of
such
uncommon
interest
that
,
although
it
is
*NL*
highly
probable
that
these
papers
may
never
reach
you
,
yet
I
can
not
*NL*
forbear
recording
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
still
surrounded
by
mountains
of
ice
,
still
in
imminent
danger
*NL*
of
being
crushed
in
their
conflict
.
The
cold
is
excessive
,
and
many
of
*NL*
my
unfortunate
comrades
have
already
found
a
grave
amidst
this
scene
of
*NL*
desolation
.
Frankenstein
has
daily
declined
in
health
;
a
feverish
fire
*NL*
still
glimmers
in
his
eyes
,
but
he
is
exhausted
,
and
when
suddenly
*NL*
roused
to
any
exertion
,
he
speedily
sinks
again
into
apparent
*NL*
lifelessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mentioned
in
my
last
letter
the
fears
I
entertained
of
a
mutiny
.
*NL*
This
morning
,
as
I
sat
watching
the
wan
countenance
of
my
friend
--
his
*NL*
eyes
half
closed
and
his
limbs
hanging
listlessly
--
I
was
roused
by
half
*NL*
a
dozen
of
the
sailors
,
who
demanded
admission
into
the
cabin
.
They
*NL*
entered
,
and
their
leader
addressed
me
.
He
told
me
that
he
and
his
*NL*
companions
had
been
chosen
by
the
other
sailors
to
come
in
deputation
*NL*
to
me
to
make
me
a
requisition
which
,
in
justice
,
I
could
not
refuse
.
*NL*
We
were
immured
in
ice
and
should
probably
never
escape
,
but
they
*NL*
feared
that
if
,
as
was
possible
,
the
ice
should
dissipate
and
a
free
*NL*
passage
be
opened
,
I
should
be
rash
enough
to
continue
my
voyage
and
*NL*
lead
them
into
fresh
dangers
,
after
they
might
happily
have
surmounted
*NL*
this
.
They
insisted
,
therefore
,
that
I
should
engage
with
a
solemn
*NL*
promise
that
if
the
vessel
should
be
freed
I
would
instantly
direct
my
*NL*
course
southwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
troubled
me
.
I
had
not
despaired
,
nor
had
I
yet
conceived
*NL*
the
idea
of
returning
if
set
free
.
Yet
could
I
,
in
justice
,
or
even
in
*NL*
possibility
,
refuse
this
demand
?
I
hesitated
before
I
answered
,
when
*NL*
Frankenstein
,
who
had
at
first
been
silent
,
and
indeed
appeared
hardly
*NL*
to
have
force
enough
to
attend
,
now
roused
himself
;
his
eyes
sparkled
,
*NL*
and
his
cheeks
flushed
with
momentary
vigour
.
Turning
towards
the
men
,
*NL*
he
said
,
``
What
do
you
mean
?
What
do
you
demand
of
your
captain
?
Are
*NL*
you
,
then
,
so
easily
turned
from
your
design
?
Did
you
not
call
this
a
*NL*
glorious
expedition
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wherefore
was
it
glorious
?
Not
because
the
way
was
smooth
and
*NL*
placid
as
a
southern
sea
,
but
because
it
was
full
of
dangers
and
*NL*
terror
,
because
at
every
new
incident
your
fortitude
was
to
be
called
*NL*
forth
and
your
courage
exhibited
,
because
danger
and
death
surrounded
*NL*
it
,
and
these
you
were
to
brave
and
overcome
.
For
this
was
it
a
*NL*
glorious
,
for
this
was
it
an
honourable
undertaking
.
You
were
*NL*
hereafter
to
be
hailed
as
the
benefactors
of
your
species
,
your
names
*NL*
adored
as
belonging
to
brave
men
who
encountered
death
for
honour
and
*NL*
the
benefit
of
mankind
.
And
now
,
behold
,
with
the
first
imagination
of
*NL*
danger
,
or
,
if
you
will
,
the
first
mighty
and
terrific
trial
of
your
*NL*
courage
,
you
shrink
away
and
are
content
to
be
handed
down
as
men
who
*NL*
had
not
strength
enough
to
endure
cold
and
peril
;
and
so
,
poor
souls
,
*NL*
they
were
chilly
and
returned
to
their
warm
firesides
.
Why
,
that
*NL*
requires
not
this
preparation
;
ye
need
not
have
come
thus
far
and
*NL*
dragged
your
captain
to
the
shame
of
a
defeat
merely
to
prove
*NL*
yourselves
cowards
.
Oh
!
Be
men
,
or
be
more
than
men
.
Be
steady
to
*NL*
your
purposes
and
firm
as
a
rock
.
This
ice
is
not
made
of
such
stuff
as
*NL*
your
hearts
may
be
;
it
is
mutable
and
can
not
withstand
you
if
you
say
*NL*
that
it
shall
not
.
Do
not
return
to
your
families
with
the
stigma
of
*NL*
disgrace
marked
on
your
brows
.
Return
as
heroes
who
have
fought
and
*NL*
conquered
and
who
know
not
what
it
is
to
turn
their
backs
on
the
foe
.
''
*NL*
He
spoke
this
with
a
voice
so
modulated
to
the
different
feelings
*NL*
expressed
in
his
speech
,
with
an
eye
so
full
of
lofty
design
and
*NL*
heroism
,
that
can
you
wonder
that
these
men
were
moved
?
They
looked
at
*NL*
one
another
and
were
unable
to
reply
.
I
spoke
;
I
told
them
to
retire
*NL*
and
consider
of
what
had
been
said
,
that
I
would
not
lead
them
farther
*NL*
north
if
they
strenuously
desired
the
contrary
,
but
that
I
hoped
that
,
*NL*
with
reflection
,
their
courage
would
return
.
They
retired
and
I
turned
*NL*
towards
my
friend
,
but
he
was
sunk
in
languor
and
almost
deprived
of
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
all
this
will
terminate
,
I
know
not
,
but
I
had
rather
die
than
*NL*
return
shamefully
,
my
purpose
unfulfilled
.
Yet
I
fear
such
will
be
my
*NL*
fate
;
the
men
,
unsupported
by
ideas
of
glory
and
honour
,
can
never
*NL*
willingly
continue
to
endure
their
present
hardships
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
September
7th
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
die
is
cast
;
I
have
consented
to
return
if
we
are
not
destroyed
.
*NL*
Thus
are
my
hopes
blasted
by
cowardice
and
indecision
;
I
come
back
*NL*
ignorant
and
disappointed
.
It
requires
more
philosophy
than
I
possess
*NL*
to
bear
this
injustice
with
patience
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
September
12th
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
past
;
I
am
returning
to
England
.
I
have
lost
my
hopes
of
utility
*NL*
and
glory
;
I
have
lost
my
friend
.
But
I
will
endeavour
to
detail
these
*NL*
bitter
circumstances
to
you
,
my
dear
sister
;
and
while
I
am
wafted
*NL*
towards
England
and
towards
you
,
I
will
not
despond
.
*NL*
*NL*
September
9th
,
the
ice
began
to
move
,
and
roarings
like
thunder
were
*NL*
heard
at
a
distance
as
the
islands
split
and
cracked
in
every
*NL*
direction
.
We
were
in
the
most
imminent
peril
,
but
as
we
could
only
*NL*
remain
passive
,
my
chief
attention
was
occupied
by
my
unfortunate
guest
*NL*
whose
illness
increased
in
such
a
degree
that
he
was
entirely
confined
*NL*
to
his
bed
.
The
ice
cracked
behind
us
and
was
driven
with
force
*NL*
towards
the
north
;
a
breeze
sprang
from
the
west
,
and
on
the
11th
the
*NL*
passage
towards
the
south
became
perfectly
free
.
When
the
sailors
saw
*NL*
this
and
that
their
return
to
their
native
country
was
apparently
*NL*
assured
,
a
shout
of
tumultuous
joy
broke
from
them
,
loud
and
*NL*
long-continued
.
Frankenstein
,
who
was
dozing
,
awoke
and
asked
the
*NL*
cause
of
the
tumult
.
``
They
shout
,
''
I
said
,
``
because
they
will
soon
*NL*
return
to
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
,
then
,
really
return
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
Yes
;
I
can
not
withstand
their
demands
.
I
can
not
lead
them
*NL*
unwillingly
to
danger
,
and
I
must
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
so
,
if
you
will
;
but
I
will
not
.
You
may
give
up
your
purpose
,
but
*NL*
mine
is
assigned
to
me
by
heaven
,
and
I
dare
not
.
I
am
weak
,
but
*NL*
surely
the
spirits
who
assist
my
vengeance
will
endow
me
with
*NL*
sufficient
strength
.
''
Saying
this
,
he
endeavoured
to
spring
from
the
*NL*
bed
,
but
the
exertion
was
too
great
for
him
;
he
fell
back
and
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
before
he
was
restored
,
and
I
often
thought
that
life
was
*NL*
entirely
extinct
.
At
length
he
opened
his
eyes
;
he
breathed
with
*NL*
difficulty
and
was
unable
to
speak
.
The
surgeon
gave
him
a
composing
*NL*
draught
and
ordered
us
to
leave
him
undisturbed
.
In
the
meantime
he
*NL*
told
me
that
my
friend
had
certainly
not
many
hours
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
sentence
was
pronounced
,
and
I
could
only
grieve
and
be
patient
.
I
*NL*
sat
by
his
bed
,
watching
him
;
his
eyes
were
closed
,
and
I
thought
he
*NL*
slept
;
but
presently
he
called
to
me
in
a
feeble
voice
,
and
bidding
me
*NL*
come
near
,
said
,
``
Alas
!
The
strength
I
relied
on
is
gone
;
I
feel
that
*NL*
I
shall
soon
die
,
and
he
,
my
enemy
and
persecutor
,
may
still
be
in
*NL*
being
.
Think
not
,
Walton
,
that
in
the
last
moments
of
my
existence
I
*NL*
feel
that
burning
hatred
and
ardent
desire
of
revenge
I
once
expressed
;
*NL*
but
I
feel
myself
justified
in
desiring
the
death
of
my
adversary
.
*NL*
During
these
last
days
I
have
been
occupied
in
examining
my
past
*NL*
conduct
;
nor
do
I
find
it
blamable
.
In
a
fit
of
enthusiastic
madness
I
*NL*
created
a
rational
creature
and
was
bound
towards
him
to
assure
,
as
far
*NL*
as
was
in
my
power
,
his
happiness
and
well-being
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
my
duty
,
but
there
was
another
still
paramount
to
that
.
My
*NL*
duties
towards
the
beings
of
my
own
species
had
greater
claims
to
my
*NL*
attention
because
they
included
a
greater
proportion
of
happiness
or
*NL*
misery
.
Urged
by
this
view
,
I
refused
,
and
I
did
right
in
refusing
,
to
*NL*
create
a
companion
for
the
first
creature
.
He
showed
unparalleled
*NL*
malignity
and
selfishness
in
evil
;
he
destroyed
my
friends
;
he
devoted
*NL*
to
destruction
beings
who
possessed
exquisite
sensations
,
happiness
,
*NL*
and
wisdom
;
nor
do
I
know
where
this
thirst
for
vengeance
may
end
.
*NL*
Miserable
himself
that
he
may
render
no
other
wretched
,
he
ought
to
*NL*
die
.
The
task
of
his
destruction
was
mine
,
but
I
have
failed
.
When
*NL*
actuated
by
selfish
and
vicious
motives
,
I
asked
you
to
undertake
my
*NL*
unfinished
work
,
and
I
renew
this
request
now
,
when
I
am
only
induced
*NL*
by
reason
and
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
can
not
ask
you
to
renounce
your
country
and
friends
to
fulfil
*NL*
this
task
;
and
now
that
you
are
returning
to
England
,
you
will
have
*NL*
little
chance
of
meeting
with
him
.
But
the
consideration
of
these
*NL*
points
,
and
the
well
balancing
of
what
you
may
esteem
your
duties
,
I
*NL*
leave
to
you
;
my
judgment
and
ideas
are
already
disturbed
by
the
near
*NL*
approach
of
death
.
I
dare
not
ask
you
to
do
what
I
think
right
,
for
I
*NL*
may
still
be
misled
by
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
should
live
to
be
an
instrument
of
mischief
disturbs
me
;
in
*NL*
other
respects
,
this
hour
,
when
I
momentarily
expect
my
release
,
is
the
*NL*
only
happy
one
which
I
have
enjoyed
for
several
years
.
The
forms
of
*NL*
the
beloved
dead
flit
before
me
,
and
I
hasten
to
their
arms
.
Farewell
,
*NL*
Walton
!
Seek
happiness
in
tranquillity
and
avoid
ambition
,
even
if
it
*NL*
be
only
the
apparently
innocent
one
of
distinguishing
yourself
in
*NL*
science
and
discoveries
.
Yet
why
do
I
say
this
?
I
have
myself
been
*NL*
blasted
in
these
hopes
,
yet
another
may
succeed

*NL*
His
voice
became
fainter
as
he
spoke
,
and
at
length
,
exhausted
by
his
*NL*
effort
,
he
sank
into
silence
.
About
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
*NL*
attempted
again
to
speak
but
was
unable
;
he
pressed
my
hand
feebly
,
and
*NL*
his
eyes
closed
forever
,
while
the
irradiation
of
a
gentle
smile
passed
*NL*
away
from
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
,
what
comment
can
I
make
on
the
untimely
extinction
of
this
*NL*
glorious
spirit
?
What
can
I
say
that
will
enable
you
to
understand
the
*NL*
depth
of
my
sorrow
?
All
that
I
should
express
would
be
inadequate
and
*NL*
feeble
.
My
tears
flow
;
my
mind
is
overshadowed
by
a
cloud
of
*NL*
disappointment
.
But
I
journey
towards
England
,
and
I
may
there
find
*NL*
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
interrupted
.
What
do
these
sounds
portend
?
It
is
midnight
;
the
*NL*
breeze
blows
fairly
,
and
the
watch
on
deck
scarcely
stir
.
Again
there
*NL*
is
a
sound
as
of
a
human
voice
,
but
hoarser
;
it
comes
from
the
cabin
*NL*
where
the
remains
of
Frankenstein
still
lie
.
I
must
arise
and
examine
.
*NL*
Good
night
,
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
God
!
what
a
scene
has
just
taken
place
!
I
am
yet
dizzy
with
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
it
.
I
hardly
know
whether
I
shall
have
the
power
to
*NL*
detail
it
;
yet
the
tale
which
I
have
recorded
would
be
incomplete
*NL*
without
this
final
and
wonderful
catastrophe
.
I
entered
the
cabin
where
*NL*
lay
the
remains
of
my
ill-fated
and
admirable
friend
.
Over
him
hung
a
*NL*
form
which
I
can
not
find
words
to
describe
--
gigantic
in
stature
,
yet
*NL*
uncouth
and
distorted
in
its
proportions
.
As
he
hung
over
the
coffin
,
*NL*
his
face
was
concealed
by
long
locks
of
ragged
hair
;
but
one
vast
hand
*NL*
was
extended
,
in
colour
and
apparent
texture
like
that
of
a
mummy
.
When
*NL*
he
heard
the
sound
of
my
approach
,
he
ceased
to
utter
exclamations
of
*NL*
grief
and
horror
and
sprung
towards
the
window
.
Never
did
I
behold
a
*NL*
vision
so
horrible
as
his
face
,
of
such
loathsome
yet
appalling
*NL*
hideousness
.
I
shut
my
eyes
involuntarily
and
endeavoured
to
recollect
*NL*
what
were
my
duties
with
regard
to
this
destroyer
.
I
called
on
him
to
*NL*
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
looking
on
me
with
wonder
,
and
again
turning
towards
the
*NL*
lifeless
form
of
his
creator
,
he
seemed
to
forget
my
presence
,
and
*NL*
every
feature
and
gesture
seemed
instigated
by
the
wildest
rage
of
some
*NL*
uncontrollable
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
also
my
victim
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
In
his
murder
my
crimes
are
*NL*
consummated
;
the
miserable
series
of
my
being
is
wound
to
its
close
!
*NL*
Oh
,
Frankenstein
!
Generous
and
self-devoted
being
!
What
does
it
avail
*NL*
that
I
now
ask
thee
to
pardon
me
?
I
,
who
irretrievably
destroyed
thee
*NL*
by
destroying
all
thou
lovedst
.
Alas
!
He
is
cold
,
he
can
not
answer
*NL*
me
.
''
His
voice
seemed
suffocated
,
and
my
first
impulses
,
which
had
*NL*
suggested
to
me
the
duty
of
obeying
the
dying
request
of
my
friend
in
*NL*
destroying
his
enemy
,
were
now
suspended
by
a
mixture
of
curiosity
and
*NL*
compassion
.
I
approached
this
tremendous
being
;
I
dared
not
again
*NL*
raise
my
eyes
to
his
face
,
there
was
something
so
scaring
and
unearthly
*NL*
in
his
ugliness
.
I
attempted
to
speak
,
but
the
words
died
away
on
my
*NL*
lips
.
The
monster
continued
to
utter
wild
and
incoherent
*NL*
self-reproaches
.
At
length
I
gathered
resolution
to
address
him
in
a
*NL*
pause
of
the
tempest
of
his
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
repentance
,
''
I
said
,
``
is
now
superfluous
.
If
you
had
listened
to
*NL*
the
voice
of
conscience
and
heeded
the
stings
of
remorse
before
you
had
*NL*
urged
your
diabolical
vengeance
to
this
extremity
,
Frankenstein
would
*NL*
yet
have
lived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
dream
?
''
said
the
daemon
.
``
Do
you
think
that
I
was
then
*NL*
dead
to
agony
and
remorse
?
He
,
''
he
continued
,
pointing
to
the
corpse
,
*NL*
``
he
suffered
not
in
the
consummation
of
the
deed
.
Oh
!
Not
the
*NL*
ten-thousandth
portion
of
the
anguish
that
was
mine
during
the
*NL*
lingering
detail
of
its
execution
.
A
frightful
selfishness
hurried
me
*NL*
on
,
while
my
heart
was
poisoned
with
remorse
.
Think
you
that
the
*NL*
groans
of
Clerval
were
music
to
my
ears
?
My
heart
was
fashioned
to
be
*NL*
susceptible
of
love
and
sympathy
,
and
when
wrenched
by
misery
to
vice
*NL*
and
hatred
,
it
did
not
endure
the
violence
of
the
change
without
*NL*
torture
such
as
you
can
not
even
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
the
murder
of
Clerval
I
returned
to
Switzerland
,
heart-broken
*NL*
and
overcome
.
I
pitied
Frankenstein
;
my
pity
amounted
to
horror
;
I
*NL*
abhorred
myself
.
But
when
I
discovered
that
he
,
the
author
at
once
of
*NL*
my
existence
and
of
its
unspeakable
torments
,
dared
to
hope
for
*NL*
happiness
,
that
while
he
accumulated
wretchedness
and
despair
upon
me
*NL*
he
sought
his
own
enjoyment
in
feelings
and
passions
from
the
*NL*
indulgence
of
which
I
was
forever
barred
,
then
impotent
envy
and
bitter
*NL*
indignation
filled
me
with
an
insatiable
thirst
for
vengeance
.
I
*NL*
recollected
my
threat
and
resolved
that
it
should
be
accomplished
.
I
*NL*
knew
that
I
was
preparing
for
myself
a
deadly
torture
,
but
I
was
the
*NL*
slave
,
not
the
master
,
of
an
impulse
which
I
detested
yet
could
not
*NL*
disobey
.
Yet
when
she
died
!
Nay
,
then
I
was
not
miserable
.
I
had
*NL*
cast
off
all
feeling
,
subdued
all
anguish
,
to
riot
in
the
excess
of
my
*NL*
despair
.
Evil
thenceforth
became
my
good
.
Urged
thus
far
,
I
had
no
*NL*
choice
but
to
adapt
my
nature
to
an
element
which
I
had
willingly
*NL*
chosen
.
The
completion
of
my
demoniacal
design
became
an
insatiable
*NL*
passion
.
And
now
it
is
ended
;
there
is
my
last
victim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
at
first
touched
by
the
expressions
of
his
misery
;
yet
,
when
I
*NL*
called
to
mind
what
Frankenstein
had
said
of
his
powers
of
eloquence
*NL*
and
persuasion
,
and
when
I
again
cast
my
eyes
on
the
lifeless
form
of
*NL*
my
friend
,
indignation
was
rekindled
within
me
.
``
Wretch
!
''
I
said
.
``
It
*NL*
is
well
that
you
come
here
to
whine
over
the
desolation
that
you
have
*NL*
made
.
You
throw
a
torch
into
a
pile
of
buildings
,
and
when
they
are
*NL*
consumed
,
you
sit
among
the
ruins
and
lament
the
fall
.
Hypocritical
*NL*
fiend
!
If
he
whom
you
mourn
still
lived
,
still
would
he
be
the
object
,
*NL*
again
would
he
become
the
prey
,
of
your
accursed
vengeance
.
It
is
not
*NL*
pity
that
you
feel
;
you
lament
only
because
the
victim
of
your
*NL*
malignity
is
withdrawn
from
your
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
not
thus
--
not
thus
,
''
interrupted
the
being
.
``
Yet
such
must
*NL*
be
the
impression
conveyed
to
you
by
what
appears
to
be
the
purport
of
*NL*
my
actions
.
Yet
I
seek
not
a
fellow
feeling
in
my
misery
.
No
sympathy
*NL*
may
I
ever
find
.
When
I
first
sought
it
,
it
was
the
love
of
virtue
,
*NL*
the
feelings
of
happiness
and
affection
with
which
my
whole
being
*NL*
overflowed
,
that
I
wished
to
be
participated
.
But
now
that
virtue
has
*NL*
become
to
me
a
shadow
,
and
that
happiness
and
affection
are
turned
into
*NL*
bitter
and
loathing
despair
,
in
what
should
I
seek
for
sympathy
?
I
am
*NL*
content
to
suffer
alone
while
my
sufferings
shall
endure
;
when
I
die
,
I
*NL*
am
well
satisfied
that
abhorrence
and
opprobrium
should
load
my
memory
.
*NL*
Once
my
fancy
was
soothed
with
dreams
of
virtue
,
of
fame
,
and
of
*NL*
enjoyment
.
Once
I
falsely
hoped
to
meet
with
beings
who
,
pardoning
my
*NL*
outward
form
,
would
love
me
for
the
excellent
qualities
which
I
was
*NL*
capable
of
unfolding
.
I
was
nourished
with
high
thoughts
of
honour
and
*NL*
devotion
.
But
now
crime
has
degraded
me
beneath
the
meanest
animal
.
No
*NL*
guilt
,
no
mischief
,
no
malignity
,
no
misery
,
can
be
found
comparable
to
*NL*
mine
.
When
I
run
over
the
frightful
catalogue
of
my
sins
,
I
can
not
*NL*
believe
that
I
am
the
same
creature
whose
thoughts
were
once
filled
*NL*
with
sublime
and
transcendent
visions
of
the
beauty
and
the
majesty
of
*NL*
goodness
.
But
it
is
even
so
;
the
fallen
angel
becomes
a
malignant
*NL*
devil
.
Yet
even
that
enemy
of
God
and
man
had
friends
and
associates
*NL*
in
his
desolation
;
I
am
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
who
call
Frankenstein
your
friend
,
seem
to
have
a
knowledge
of
my
*NL*
crimes
and
his
misfortunes
.
But
in
the
detail
which
he
gave
you
of
them
*NL*
he
could
not
sum
up
the
hours
and
months
of
misery
which
I
endured
*NL*
wasting
in
impotent
passions
.
For
while
I
destroyed
his
hopes
,
I
did
*NL*
not
satisfy
my
own
desires
.
They
were
forever
ardent
and
craving
;
still
*NL*
I
desired
love
and
fellowship
,
and
I
was
still
spurned
.
Was
there
no
*NL*
injustice
in
this
?
Am
I
to
be
thought
the
only
criminal
,
when
all
*NL*
humankind
sinned
against
me
?
Why
do
you
not
hate
Felix
,
who
drove
his
*NL*
friend
from
his
door
with
contumely
?
Why
do
you
not
execrate
the
rustic
*NL*
who
sought
to
destroy
the
saviour
of
his
child
?
Nay
,
these
are
virtuous
*NL*
and
immaculate
beings
!
I
,
the
miserable
and
the
abandoned
,
am
an
*NL*
abortion
,
to
be
spurned
at
,
and
kicked
,
and
trampled
on
.
Even
now
my
*NL*
blood
boils
at
the
recollection
of
this
injustice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
true
that
I
am

murdered

have
strangled
the
innocent
as
they
slept
and
grasped
to

death
his
throat
who
never
injured
me

any
other
living

devoted

select
specimen

all

worthy

that
irremediable

not
equal
that
with
which
I
regard
myself

I
look
on
the
*NL*
hands
which
executed
the
deed
;
I
think
on
the
heart
in
which
the
*NL*
imagination
of
it
was
conceived
and
long
for
the
moment
when
these
*NL*

crimes
and
torn
by
the
bitterest
remorse
,
*NL*
where
can
I
find
rest
but
in
death
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
!
I
leave
you
,
and
in
you
the
last
of
humankind
whom
these
*NL*
eyes
will
ever
behold
.
Farewell
,
Frankenstein
!
If
thou
wert
yet
alive
*NL*
and
yet
cherished
a
desire
of
revenge
against
me
,
it
would
be
better
*NL*
satiated
in
my
life
than
in
my
destruction
.
But
it
was
not
so
;
thou
*NL*
didst
seek
my
extinction
,
that
I
might
not
cause
greater
wretchedness
;
*NL*
and
if
yet
,
in
some
mode
unknown
to
me
,
thou
hadst
not
ceased
to
think
*NL*
and
feel
,
thou
wouldst
not
desire
against
me
a
vengeance
greater
than
*NL*
that
which
I
feel
.
Blasted
as
thou
wert
,
my
agony
was
still
superior
to
*NL*
thine
,
for
the
bitter
sting
of
remorse
will
not
cease
to
rankle
in
my
*NL*
wounds
until
death
shall
close
them
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
soon
,
''
he
cried
with
sad
and
solemn
enthusiasm
,
``
I
shall
die
,
and
*NL*
what
I
now
feel
be
no
longer
felt
.
Soon
these
burning
miseries
will
be
*NL*
extinct
.
I
shall
ascend
my
funeral
pile
triumphantly
and
exult
in
the
*NL*
agony
of
the
torturing
flames
.
The
light
of
that
conflagration
will
*NL*
fade
away
;
my
ashes
will
be
swept
into
the
sea
by
the
winds
.
My
spirit
*NL*
will
sleep
in
peace
,
or
if
it
thinks
,
it
will
not
surely
think
thus
.
*NL*
Farewell
.

He
sprang
from
the
cabin
window
as
he
said
this
,
upon
the
ice
raft
*NL*
which
lay
close
to
the
vessel
.
He
was
soon
borne
away
by
the
waves
and
*NL*
lost
in
darkness
and
distance
.
