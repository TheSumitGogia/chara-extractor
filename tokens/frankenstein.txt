PREFACE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
event
on
which
this
fiction
is
founded
has
been
supposed
,
by
Dr.
*NL*
Darwin
,
and
some
of
the
physiological
writers
of
Germany
,
as
not
of
*NL*
impossible
occurrence
.
I
shall
not
be
supposed
as
according
the
remotest
*NL*
degree
of
serious
faith
to
such
an
imagination
;
yet
,
in
assuming
it
as
*NL*
the
basis
of
a
work
of
fancy
,
I
have
not
considered
myself
as
merely
*NL*
weaving
a
series
of
supernatural
terrors
.
The
event
on
which
the
*NL*
interest
of
the
story
depends
is
exempt
from
the
disadvantages
of
a
mere
*NL*
tale
of
spectres
or
enchantment
.
It
was
recommended
by
the
novelty
of
*NL*
the
situations
which
it
developes
;
and
,
however
impossible
as
a
physical
*NL*
fact
,
affords
a
point
of
view
to
the
imagination
for
the
delineating
of
*NL*
human
passions
more
comprehensive
and
commanding
than
any
which
the
*NL*
ordinary
relations
of
existing
events
can
yield
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
thus
endeavoured
to
preserve
the
truth
of
the
elementary
*NL*
principles
of
human
nature
,
while
I
have
not
scrupled
to
innovate
*NL*
upon
their
combinations
.
The
_
Iliad
_
,
the
tragic
poetry
of
*NL*
Greece
,
--
Shakespeare
,
in
the
_
Tempest
_
and
_
Midsummer
Night
's
*NL*
Dream
_
,
--
and
most
especially
Milton
,
in
_
Paradise
Lost
_
,
conform
to
this
*NL*
rule
;
and
the
most
humble
novelist
,
who
seeks
to
confer
or
receive
*NL*
amusement
from
his
labours
,
may
,
without
presumption
,
apply
to
prose
*NL*
fiction
a
licence
,
or
rather
a
rule
,
from
the
adoption
of
which
so
many
*NL*
exquisite
combinations
of
human
feeling
have
resulted
in
the
highest
*NL*
specimens
of
poetry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circumstance
on
which
my
story
rests
was
suggested
in
casual
*NL*
conversation
.
It
was
commenced
,
partly
as
a
source
of
amusement
,
and
*NL*
partly
as
an
expedient
for
exercising
any
untried
resources
of
mind
.
*NL*
Other
motives
were
mingled
with
these
,
as
the
work
proceeded
.
I
am
by
no
*NL*
means
indifferent
to
the
manner
in
which
whatever
moral
tendencies
exist
*NL*
in
the
sentiments
or
characters
it
contains
shall
affect
the
reader
;
yet
*NL*
my
chief
concern
in
this
respect
has
been
limited
to
the
avoiding
of
the
*NL*
enervating
effects
of
the
novels
of
the
present
day
,
and
to
the
*NL*
exhibitions
of
the
amiableness
of
domestic
affection
,
and
the
excellence
*NL*
of
universal
virtue
.
The
opinions
which
naturally
spring
from
the
*NL*
character
and
situation
of
the
hero
are
by
no
means
to
be
conceived
as
*NL*
existing
always
in
my
own
conviction
;
nor
is
any
inference
justly
to
be
*NL*
drawn
from
the
following
pages
as
prejudicing
any
philosophical
doctrine
*NL*
of
whatever
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
subject
also
of
additional
interest
to
the
author
,
that
this
*NL*
story
was
begun
in
the
majestic
region
where
the
scene
is
principally
*NL*
laid
,
and
in
society
which
can
not
cease
to
be
regretted
.
I
passed
the
*NL*
summer
of
1816
in
the
environs
of
Geneva
.
The
season
was
cold
and
rainy
,
*NL*
and
in
the
evenings
we
crowded
around
a
blazing
wood
fire
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
amused
ourselves
with
some
German
stories
of
ghosts
,
which
*NL*
happened
to
fall
into
our
hands
.
These
tales
excited
in
us
a
playful
*NL*
desire
of
imitation
.
Two
other
friends
-LRB-
a
tale
from
the
pen
of
one
of
*NL*
whom
would
be
far
more
acceptable
to
the
public
than
any
thing
I
can
*NL*
ever
hope
to
produce
-RRB-
and
myself
agreed
to
write
each
a
story
,
founded
*NL*
on
some
supernatural
occurrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
weather
,
however
,
suddenly
became
serene
;
and
my
two
friends
left
me
*NL*
on
a
journey
among
the
Alps
,
and
lost
,
in
the
magnificent
scenes
which
*NL*
they
present
,
all
memory
of
their
ghostly
visions
.
The
following
tale
is
*NL*
the
only
one
which
has
been
completed
.

*NL*
*NL*
You
will
rejoice
to
hear
that
no
disaster
has
accompanied
the
*NL*
commencement
of
an
enterprise
which
you
have
regarded
with
such
evil
*NL*
forebodings
.
I
arrived
here
yesterday
;
and
my
first
task
is
to
assure
my
*NL*
dear
sister
of
my
welfare
,
and
increasing
confidence
in
the
success
of
*NL*
my
undertaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
already
far
north
of
London
;
and
as
I
walk
in
the
streets
of
*NL*
Petersburgh
,
I
feel
a
cold
northern
breeze
play
upon
my
cheeks
,
which
*NL*
braces
my
nerves
,
and
fills
me
with
delight
.
Do
you
understand
this
*NL*
feeling
?
This
breeze
,
which
has
travelled
from
the
regions
towards
which
*NL*
I
am
advancing
,
gives
me
a
foretaste
of
those
icy
climes
.
Inspirited
by
*NL*
this
wind
of
promise
,
my
day
dreams
become
more
fervent
and
vivid
.
I
try
*NL*
in
vain
to
be
persuaded
that
the
pole
is
the
seat
of
frost
and
*NL*
desolation
;
it
ever
presents
itself
to
my
imagination
as
the
region
of
*NL*
beauty
and
delight
.
There
,
Margaret
,
the
sun
is
for
ever
visible
;
its
*NL*
broad
disk
just
skirting
the
horizon
,
and
diffusing
a
perpetual
*NL*
splendour
.
There
--
for
with
your
leave
,
my
sister
,
I
will
put
some
trust
*NL*
in
preceding
navigators
--
there
snow
and
frost
are
banished
;
and
,
sailing
*NL*
over
a
calm
sea
,
we
may
be
wafted
to
a
land
surpassing
in
wonders
and
in
*NL*
beauty
every
region
hitherto
discovered
on
the
habitable
globe
.
Its
*NL*
productions
and
features
may
be
without
example
,
as
the
phaenomena
of
the
*NL*
heavenly
bodies
undoubtedly
are
in
those
undiscovered
solitudes
.
What
*NL*
may
not
be
expected
in
a
country
of
eternal
light
?
I
may
there
discover
*NL*
the
wondrous
power
which
attracts
the
needle
;
and
may
regulate
a
*NL*
thousand
celestial
observations
,
that
require
only
this
voyage
to
render
*NL*
their
seeming
eccentricities
consistent
for
ever
.
I
shall
satiate
my
*NL*
ardent
curiosity
with
the
sight
of
a
part
of
the
world
never
before
*NL*
visited
,
and
may
tread
a
land
never
before
imprinted
by
the
foot
of
man
.
*NL*
These
are
my
enticements
,
and
they
are
sufficient
to
conquer
all
fear
of
*NL*
danger
or
death
,
and
to
induce
me
to
commence
this
laborious
voyage
with
*NL*
the
joy
a
child
feels
when
he
embarks
in
a
little
boat
,
with
his
holiday
*NL*
mates
,
on
an
expedition
of
discovery
up
his
native
river
.
But
,
supposing
*NL*
all
these
conjectures
to
be
false
,
you
can
not
contest
the
inestimable
*NL*
benefit
which
I
shall
confer
on
all
mankind
to
the
last
generation
,
by
*NL*
discovering
a
passage
near
the
pole
to
those
countries
,
to
reach
which
*NL*
at
present
so
many
months
are
requisite
;
or
by
ascertaining
the
secret
*NL*
of
the
magnet
,
which
,
if
at
all
possible
,
can
only
be
effected
by
an
*NL*
undertaking
such
as
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
reflections
have
dispelled
the
agitation
with
which
I
began
my
*NL*
letter
,
and
I
feel
my
heart
glow
with
an
enthusiasm
which
elevates
me
to
*NL*
heaven
;
for
nothing
contributes
so
much
to
tranquillize
the
mind
as
a
*NL*
steady
purpose
,
--
a
point
on
which
the
soul
may
fix
its
intellectual
eye
.
*NL*
This
expedition
has
been
the
favourite
dream
of
my
early
years
.
I
have
*NL*
read
with
ardour
the
accounts
of
the
various
voyages
which
have
been
*NL*
made
in
the
prospect
of
arriving
at
the
North
Pacific
Ocean
through
the
*NL*
seas
which
surround
the
pole
.
You
may
remember
,
that
a
history
of
all
*NL*
the
voyages
made
for
purposes
of
discovery
composed
the
whole
of
our
*NL*
good
uncle
Thomas
's
library
.
My
education
was
neglected
,
yet
I
was
*NL*
passionately
fond
of
reading
.
These
volumes
were
my
study
day
and
night
,
*NL*
and
my
familiarity
with
them
increased
that
regret
which
I
had
felt
,
as
*NL*
a
child
,
on
learning
that
my
father
's
dying
injunction
had
forbidden
my
*NL*
uncle
to
allow
me
to
embark
in
a
sea-faring
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
visions
faded
when
I
perused
,
for
the
first
time
,
those
poets
*NL*
whose
effusions
entranced
my
soul
,
and
lifted
it
to
heaven
.
I
also
*NL*
became
a
poet
,
and
for
one
year
lived
in
a
Paradise
of
my
own
creation
;
*NL*
I
imagined
that
I
also
might
obtain
a
niche
in
the
temple
where
the
*NL*
names
of
Homer
and
Shakespeare
are
consecrated
.
You
are
well
acquainted
*NL*
with
my
failure
,
and
how
heavily
I
bore
the
disappointment
.
But
just
at
*NL*
that
time
I
inherited
the
fortune
of
my
cousin
,
and
my
thoughts
were
*NL*
turned
into
the
channel
of
their
earlier
bent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
years
have
passed
since
I
resolved
on
my
present
undertaking
.
I
can
,
*NL*
even
now
,
remember
the
hour
from
which
I
dedicated
myself
to
this
great
*NL*
enterprise
.
I
commenced
by
inuring
my
body
to
hardship
.
I
accompanied
*NL*
the
whale-fishers
on
several
expeditions
to
the
North
Sea
;
I
voluntarily
*NL*
endured
cold
,
famine
,
thirst
,
and
want
of
sleep
;
I
often
worked
harder
*NL*
than
the
common
sailors
during
the
day
,
and
devoted
my
nights
to
the
*NL*
study
of
mathematics
,
the
theory
of
medicine
,
and
those
branches
of
*NL*
physical
science
from
which
a
naval
adventurer
might
derive
the
greatest
*NL*
practical
advantage
.
Twice
I
actually
hired
myself
as
an
under-mate
in
*NL*
a
Greenland
whaler
,
and
acquitted
myself
to
admiration
.
I
must
own
I
*NL*
felt
a
little
proud
,
when
my
captain
offered
me
the
second
dignity
in
*NL*
the
vessel
,
and
entreated
me
to
remain
with
the
greatest
earnestness
;
so
*NL*
valuable
did
he
consider
my
services
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
dear
Margaret
,
do
I
not
deserve
to
accomplish
some
great
*NL*
purpose
.
My
life
might
have
been
passed
in
ease
and
luxury
;
but
I
*NL*
preferred
glory
to
every
enticement
that
wealth
placed
in
my
path
.
Oh
,
*NL*
that
some
encouraging
voice
would
answer
in
the
affirmative
!
My
courage
*NL*
and
my
resolution
is
firm
;
but
my
hopes
fluctuate
,
and
my
spirits
are
*NL*
often
depressed
.
I
am
about
to
proceed
on
a
long
and
difficult
voyage
;
*NL*
the
emergencies
of
which
will
demand
all
my
fortitude
:
I
am
required
not
*NL*
only
to
raise
the
spirits
of
others
,
but
sometimes
to
sustain
my
own
,
*NL*
when
their
's
are
failing
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
most
favourable
period
for
travelling
in
Russia
.
They
fly
*NL*
quickly
over
the
snow
in
their
sledges
;
the
motion
is
pleasant
,
and
,
in
*NL*
my
opinion
,
far
more
agreeable
than
that
of
an
English
stage-coach
.
The
*NL*
cold
is
not
excessive
,
if
you
are
wrapt
in
furs
,
a
dress
which
I
have
*NL*
already
adopted
;
for
there
is
a
great
difference
between
walking
the
*NL*
deck
and
remaining
seated
motionless
for
hours
,
when
no
exercise
*NL*
prevents
the
blood
from
actually
freezing
in
your
veins
.
I
have
no
*NL*
ambition
to
lose
my
life
on
the
post-road
between
St.
Petersburgh
and
*NL*
Archangel
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
depart
for
the
latter
town
in
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
;
and
my
*NL*
intention
is
to
hire
a
ship
there
,
which
can
easily
be
done
by
paying
*NL*
the
insurance
for
the
owner
,
and
to
engage
as
many
sailors
as
I
think
*NL*
necessary
among
those
who
are
accustomed
to
the
whale-fishing
.
I
do
not
*NL*
intend
to
sail
until
the
month
of
June
:
and
when
shall
I
return
?
Ah
,
*NL*
dear
sister
,
how
can
I
answer
this
question
?
If
I
succeed
,
many
,
many
*NL*
months
,
perhaps
years
,
will
pass
before
you
and
I
may
meet
.
If
I
fail
,
*NL*
you
will
see
me
again
soon
,
or
never
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farewell
,
my
dear
,
excellent
,
Margaret
.
Heaven
shower
down
blessings
on
*NL*
you
,
and
save
me
,
that
I
may
again
and
again
testify
my
gratitude
for
*NL*
all
your
love
and
kindness
.

How
slowly
the
time
passes
here
,
encompassed
as
I
am
by
frost
and
snow
;
*NL*
yet
a
second
step
is
taken
towards

I
have

am

those
whom
I

courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
have
one
want
which
I
have
never
yet
been
able
to
satisfy
;
and
the
*NL*
absence
of
the
object
of
which
I
now
feel
as
a
most
severe
evil
.
I
have
*NL*
no
friend
,
Margaret
:
when
I
am
glowing
with
the
enthusiasm
of
success
,
*NL*
there
will
be
none
to
participate
my
joy
;
if
I
am
assailed
by
*NL*
disappointment
,
no
one
will
endeavour
to
sustain
me
in
dejection
.
I
*NL*
shall
commit
my
thoughts
to
paper
,
it
is
true
;
but
that
is
a
poor
medium
*NL*
for
the
communication
of
feeling
.
I
desire
the
company
of
a
man
who
*NL*
could
sympathize
with
me
;
whose
eyes
would
reply
to
mine
.
You
may
deem
*NL*
me
romantic
,
my
dear
sister
,
but
I
bitterly
feel
the
want
of
a
friend
.
I
*NL*
have
no
one
near
me
,
gentle
yet
courageous
,
possessed
of
a
cultivated
as
*NL*
well
as
of
a
capacious
mind
,
whose
tastes
are
like
my
own
,
to
approve
*NL*
or
amend
my
plans
.
How
would
such
a
friend
repair
the
faults
of
your
*NL*
poor
brother
!
I
am
too
ardent
in
execution
,
and
too
impatient
of
*NL*
difficulties
.
But
it
is
a
still
greater
evil
to
me
that
I
am
*NL*
self-educated
:
for
the
first
fourteen
years
of
my
life
I
ran
wild
on
a
*NL*
common
,
and
read
nothing
but
our
uncle
Thomas
's
books
of
voyages
.
At
*NL*
that
age
I
became
acquainted
with
the
celebrated
poets
of
our
own
*NL*
country
;
but
it
was
only
when
it
had
ceased
to
be
in
my
power
to
derive
*NL*
its
most
important
benefits
from
such
a
conviction
,
that
I
perceived
the
*NL*
necessity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
more
languages
than
that
of
my
*NL*
native
country
.
Now
I
am
twenty-eight
,
and
am
in
reality
more
illiterate
*NL*
than
many
school-boys
of
fifteen
.
It
is
true
that
I
have
thought
more
,
*NL*
and
that
my
day
dreams
are
more
extended
and
magnificent
;
but
they
want
*NL*
-LRB-
as
the
painters
call
it
-RRB-
_
keeping
_
;
and
I
greatly
need
a
friend
who
*NL*
would
have
sense
enough
not
to
despise
me
as
romantic
,
and
affection
*NL*
enough
for
me
to
endeavour
to
regulate
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
these
are
useless
complaints
;
I
shall
certainly
find
no
friend
on
*NL*
the
wide
ocean
,
nor
even
here
in
Archangel
,
among
merchants
and
seamen
.
*NL*
Yet
some
feelings
,
unallied
to
the
dross
of
human
nature
,
beat
even
in
*NL*
these
rugged
bosoms
.
My
lieutenant
,
for
instance
,
is
a
man
of
wonderful
*NL*
courage
and
enterprise
;
he
is
madly
desirous
of
glory
.
He
is
an
*NL*
Englishman
,
and
in
the
midst
of
national
and
professional
prejudices
,
*NL*
unsoftened
by
cultivation
,
retains
some
of
the
noblest
endowments
of
*NL*
humanity
.
I
first
became
acquainted
with
him
on
board
a
whale
vessel
:
*NL*
finding
that
he
was
unemployed
in
this
city
,
I
easily
engaged
him
to
*NL*
assist
in
my
enterprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
is
a
person
of
an
excellent
disposition
,
and
is
remarkable
in
*NL*
the
ship
for
his
gentleness
,
and
the
mildness
of
his
discipline
.
He
is
,
*NL*
indeed
,
of
so
amiable
a
nature
,
that
he
will
not
hunt
-LRB-
a
favourite
,
and
*NL*
almost
the
only
amusement
here
-RRB-
,
because
he
can
not
endure
to
spill
*NL*
blood
.
He
is
,
moreover
,
heroically
generous
.
Some
years
ago
he
loved
a
*NL*
young
Russian
lady
,
of
moderate
fortune
;
and
having
amassed
a
*NL*
considerable
sum
in
prize-money
,
the
father
of
the
girl
consented
to
the
*NL*
match
.
He
saw
his
mistress
once
before
the
destined
ceremony
;
but
she
*NL*
was
bathed
in
tears
,
and
,
throwing
herself
at
his
feet
,
entreated
him
to
*NL*
spare
her
,
confessing
at
the
same
time
that
she
loved
another
,
but
that
*NL*
he
was
poor
,
and
that
her
father
would
never
consent
to
the
union
.
My
*NL*
generous
friend
reassured
the
suppliant
,
and
on
being
informed
of
the
*NL*
name
of
her
lover
instantly
abandoned
his
pursuit
.
He
had
already
bought
*NL*
a
farm
with
his
money
,
on
which
he
had
designed
to
pass
the
remainder
of
*NL*
his
life
;
but
he
bestowed
the
whole
on
his
rival
,
together
with
the
*NL*
remains
of
his
prize-money
to
purchase
stock
,
and
then
himself
solicited
*NL*
the
young
woman
's
father
to
consent
to
her
marriage
with
her
lover
.
But
*NL*
the
old
man
decidedly
refused
,
thinking
himself
bound
in
honour
to
my
*NL*
friend
;
who
,
when
he
found
the
father
inexorable
,
quitted
his
country
,
*NL*
nor
returned
until
he
heard
that
his
former
mistress
was
married
*NL*
according
to
her
inclinations
.
``
What
a
noble
fellow
!
''
you
will
exclaim
.
*NL*
He
is
so
;
but
then
he
has
passed
all
his
life
on
board
a
vessel
,
and
has
*NL*
scarcely
an
idea
beyond
the
rope
and
the
shroud
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
do
not
suppose
that
,
because
I
complain
a
little
,
or
because
I
can
*NL*
conceive
a
consolation
for
my
toils
which
I
may
never
know
,
that
I
am
*NL*
wavering
in
my
resolutions
.
Those
are
as
fixed
as
fate
;
and
my
voyage
is
*NL*
only
now
delayed
until
the
weather
shall
permit
my
embarkation
.
The
*NL*
winter
has
been
dreadfully
severe
;
but
the
spring
promises
well
,
and
it
*NL*
is
considered
as
a
remarkably
early
season
;
so
that
,
perhaps
,
I
may
sail
*NL*
sooner
than
I
expected
.
I
shall
do
nothing
rashly
;
you
know
me
*NL*
sufficiently
to
confide
in
my
prudence
and
considerateness
whenever
the
*NL*
safety
of
others
is
committed
to
my
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
describe
to
you
my
sensations
on
the
near
prospect
of
my
*NL*
undertaking
.
It
is
impossible
to
communicate
to
you
a
conception
of
the
*NL*
trembling
sensation
,
half
pleasurable
and
half
fearful
,
with
which
I
am
*NL*
preparing
to
depart
.
I
am
going
to
unexplored
regions
,
to
``
the
land
of
*NL*
mist
and
snow
;
''
but
I
shall
kill
no
albatross
,
therefore
do
not
be
*NL*
alarmed
for
my
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shall
I
meet
you
again
,
after
having
traversed
immense
seas
,
and
*NL*
returned
by
the
most
southern
cape
of
Africa
or
America
?
I
dare
not
*NL*
expect
such
success
,
yet
I
can
not
bear
to
look
on
the
reverse
of
the
*NL*
picture
.
Continue
to
write
to
me
by
every
opportunity
:
I
may
receive
*NL*
your
letters
-LRB-
though
the
chance
is
very
doubtful
-RRB-
on
some
occasions
when
*NL*
I
need
them
most
to
support
my
spirits
.
I
love
you
very
tenderly
.
*NL*
Remember
me
with
affection
,
should
you
never
hear
from
me
again
.

*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
SISTER
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
write
a
few
lines
in
haste
,
to
say
that
I
am
safe
,
and
well
advanced
*NL*
on
my
voyage
.
This
letter
will
reach
England
by
a
merchant-man
now
on
*NL*
its
homeward
voyage
from
Archangel
;
more
fortunate
than
I
,
who
may
not
*NL*
see
my
native
land
,
perhaps
,
for
many
years
.
I
am
,
however
,
in
good
*NL*
spirits
:
my
men
are
bold
,
and
apparently
firm
of
purpose
;
nor
do
the
*NL*
floating
sheets
of
ice
that
continually
pass
us
,
indicating
the
dangers
*NL*
of
the
region
towards
which
we
are
advancing
,
appear
to
dismay
them
.
We
*NL*
have
already
reached
a
very
high
latitude
;
but
it
is
the
height
of
*NL*
summer
,
and
although
not
so
warm
as
in
England
,
the
southern
gales
,
*NL*
which
blow
us
speedily
towards
those
shores
which
I
so
ardently
desire
*NL*
to
attain
,
breathe
a
degree
of
renovating
warmth
which
I
had
not
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
incidents
have
hitherto
befallen
us
,
that
would
make
a
figure
in
a
*NL*
letter
.
One
or
two
stiff
gales
,
and
the
breaking
of
a
mast
,
are
*NL*
accidents
which
experienced
navigators
scarcely
remember
to
record
;
and
*NL*
I
shall
be
well
content
,
if
nothing
worse
happen
to
us
during
our
*NL*
voyage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adieu
,
my
dear
Margaret
.
Be
assured
,
that
for
my
own
sake
,
as
well
as
*NL*
your
's
,
I
will
not
rashly
encounter
danger
.
I
will
be
cool
,
persevering
,
*NL*
and
prudent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Remember
me
to
all
my
English
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
affectionately
yours
,

SAVILLE

_
England
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
August
5th

--
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
strange
an
accident
has
happened
to
us
,
that
I
can
not
forbear
*NL*
recording
it
,
although
it
is
very
probable
that
you
will
see
me
before
*NL*
these
papers
can
come
into
your
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Last
Monday
-LRB-
July
31st
-RRB-
,
we
were
nearly
surrounded
by
ice
,
which
closed
*NL*
in
the
ship
on
all
sides
,
scarcely
leaving
her
the
sea
room
in
which
she
*NL*
floated
.
Our
situation
was
somewhat
dangerous
,
especially
as
we
were
*NL*
compassed
round
by
a
very
thick
fog
.
We
accordingly
lay
to
,
hoping
that
*NL*
some
change
would
take
place
in
the
atmosphere
and
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
o'clock
the
mist
cleared
away
,
and
we
beheld
,
stretched
out
in
*NL*
every
direction
,
vast
and
irregular
plains
of
ice
,
which
seemed
to
have
*NL*
no
end
.
Some
of
my
comrades
groaned
,
and
my
own
mind
began
to
grow
*NL*
watchful
with
anxious
thoughts
,
when
a
strange
sight
suddenly
attracted
*NL*
our
attention
,
and
diverted
our
solicitude
from
our
own
situation
.
We
*NL*
perceived
a
low
carriage
,
fixed
on
a
sledge
and
drawn
by
dogs
,
pass
on
*NL*
towards
the
north
,
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
:
a
being
which
had
the
*NL*
shape
of
a
man
,
but
apparently
of
gigantic
stature
,
sat
in
the
sledge
,
*NL*
and
guided
the
dogs
.
We
watched
the
rapid
progress
of
the
traveller
*NL*
with
our
telescopes
,
until
he
was
lost
among
the
distant
inequalities
of
*NL*
the
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
appearance
excited
our
unqualified
wonder
.
We
were
,
as
we
believed
,
*NL*
many
hundred
miles
from
any
land
;
but
this
apparition
seemed
to
denote
*NL*
that
it
was
not
,
in
reality
,
so
distant
as
we
had
supposed
.
Shut
in
,
*NL*
however
,
by
ice
,
it
was
impossible
to
follow
his
track
,
which
we
had
*NL*
observed
with
the
greatest
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
hours
after
this
occurrence
,
we
heard
the
ground
sea
;
and
*NL*
before
night
the
ice
broke
,
and
freed
our
ship
.
We
,
however
,
lay
to
*NL*
until
the
morning
,
fearing
to
encounter
in
the
dark
those
large
loose
*NL*
masses
which
float
about
after
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
.
I
profited
of
*NL*
this
time
to
rest
for
a
few
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
however
,
as
soon
as
it
was
light
,
I
went
upon
deck
,
and
*NL*
found
all
the
sailors
busy
on
one
side
of
the
vessel
,
apparently
talking
*NL*
to
some
one
in
the
sea
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
a
sledge
,
like
that
we
had
seen
*NL*
before
,
which
had
drifted
towards
us
in
the
night
,
on
a
large
fragment
*NL*
of
ice
.
Only
one
dog
remained
alive
;
but
there
was
a
human
being
within
*NL*
it
,
whom
the
sailors
were
persuading
to
enter
the
vessel
.
He
was
not
,
as
*NL*
the
other
traveller
seemed
to
be
,
a
savage
inhabitant
of
some
*NL*
undiscovered
island
,
but
an
European
.
When
I
appeared
on
deck
,
the
*NL*
master
said
,
``
Here
is
our
captain
,
and
he
will
not
allow
you
to
perish
*NL*
on
the
open
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
perceiving
me
,
the
stranger
addressed
me
in
English
,
although
with
a
*NL*
foreign
accent
.
``
Before
I
come
on
board
your
vessel
,
''
said
he
,
``
will
you
*NL*
have
the
kindness
to
inform
me
whither
you
are
bound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
conceive
my
astonishment
on
hearing
such
a
question
addressed
to
*NL*
me
from
a
man
on
the
brink
of
destruction
,
and
to
whom
I
should
have
*NL*
supposed
that
my
vessel
would
have
been
a
resource
which
he
would
not
*NL*
have
exchanged
for
the
most
precious
wealth
the
earth
can
afford
.
I
*NL*
replied
,
however
,
that
we
were
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
towards
the
*NL*
northern
pole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
hearing
this
he
appeared
satisfied
,
and
consented
to
come
on
board
.
*NL*
Good
God
!
Margaret
,
if
you
had
seen
the
man
who
thus
capitulated
for
his
*NL*
safety
,
your
surprise
would
have
been
boundless
.
His
limbs
were
nearly
*NL*
frozen
,
and
his
body
dreadfully
emaciated
by
fatigue
and
suffering
.
I
*NL*
never
saw
a
man
in
so
wretched
a
condition
.
We
attempted
to
carry
him
*NL*
into
the
cabin
;
but
as
soon
as
he
had
quitted
the
fresh
air
,
he
fainted
.
*NL*
We
accordingly
brought
him
back
to
the
deck
,
and
restored
him
to
*NL*
animation
by
rubbing
him
with
brandy
,
and
forcing
him
to
swallow
a
small
*NL*
quantity
.
As
soon
as
he
shewed
signs
of
life
,
we
wrapped
him
up
in
*NL*
blankets
,
and
placed
him
near
the
chimney
of
the
kitchen-stove
.
By
slow
*NL*
degrees
he
recovered
,
and
ate
a
little
soup
,
which
restored
him
*NL*
wonderfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
passed
in
this
manner
before
he
was
able
to
speak
;
and
I
often
*NL*
feared
that
his
sufferings
had
deprived
him
of
understanding
.
When
he
*NL*
had
in
some
measure
recovered
,
I
removed
him
to
my
own
cabin
,
and
*NL*
attended
on
him
as
much
as
my
duty
would
permit
.
I
never
saw
a
more
*NL*
interesting
creature
:
his
eyes
have
generally
an
expression
of
wildness
,
*NL*
and
even
madness
;
but
there
are
moments
when
,
if
any
one
performs
an
act
*NL*
of
kindness
towards
him
,
or
does
him
any
the
most
trifling
service
,
his
*NL*
whole
countenance
is
lighted
up
,
as
it
were
,
with
a
beam
of
benevolence
*NL*
and
sweetness
that
I
never
saw
equalled
.
But
he
is
generally
melancholy
*NL*
and
despairing
;
and
sometimes
he
gnashes
his
teeth
,
as
if
impatient
of
*NL*
the
weight
of
woes
that
oppresses
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
guest
was
a
little
recovered
,
I
had
great
trouble
to
keep
off
*NL*
the
men
,
who
wished
to
ask
him
a
thousand
questions
;
but
I
would
not
*NL*
allow
him
to
be
tormented
by
their
idle
curiosity
,
in
a
state
of
body
*NL*
and
mind
whose
restoration
evidently
depended
upon
entire
repose
.
Once
,
*NL*
however
,
the
lieutenant
asked
,
Why
he
had
come
so
far
upon
the
ice
in
so
*NL*
strange
a
vehicle
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
countenance
instantly
assumed
an
aspect
of
the
deepest
gloom
;
and
he
*NL*
replied
,
``
To
seek
one
who
fled
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
the
man
whom
you
pursued
travel
in
the
same
fashion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
fancy
we
have
seen
him
;
for
,
the
day
before
we
picked
you
up
,
we
*NL*
saw
some
dogs
drawing
a
sledge
,
with
a
man
in
it
,
across
the
ice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
aroused
the
stranger
's
attention
;
and
he
asked
a
multitude
of
*NL*
questions
concerning
the
route
which
the
daemon
,
as
he
called
him
,
had
*NL*
pursued
.
Soon
after
,
when
he
was
alone
with
me
,
he
said
,
``
I
have
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
excited
your
curiosity
,
as
well
as
that
of
these
good
people
;
*NL*
but
you
are
too
considerate
to
make
inquiries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
it
would
indeed
be
very
impertinent
and
inhuman
in
me
to
*NL*
trouble
you
with
any
inquisitiveness
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
you
rescued
me
from
a
strange
and
perilous
situation
;
you
have
*NL*
benevolently
restored
me
to
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
he
inquired
,
if
I
thought
that
the
breaking
up
of
the
*NL*
ice
had
destroyed
the
other
sledge
?
I
replied
,
that
I
could
not
answer
*NL*
with
any
degree
of
certainty
;
for
the
ice
had
not
broken
until
near
*NL*
midnight
,
and
the
traveller
might
have
arrived
at
a
place
of
safety
*NL*
before
that
time
;
but
of
this
I
could
not
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
the
stranger
seemed
very
eager
to
be
upon
deck
,
to
watch
*NL*
for
the
sledge
which
had
before
appeared
;
but
I
have
persuaded
him
to
*NL*
remain
in
the
cabin
,
for
he
is
far
too
weak
to
sustain
the
rawness
of
*NL*
the
atmosphere
.
But
I
have
promised
that
some
one
should
watch
for
him
,
*NL*
and
give
him
instant
notice
if
any
new
object
should
appear
in
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
my
journal
of
what
relates
to
this
strange
occurrence
up
to
the
*NL*
present
day
.
The
stranger
has
gradually
improved
in
health
,
but
is
very
*NL*
silent
,
and
appears
uneasy
when
any
one
except
myself
enters
his
cabin
.
*NL*
Yet
his
manners
are
so
conciliating
and
gentle
,
that
the
sailors
are
all
*NL*
interested
in
him
,
although
they
have
had
very
little
communication
with
*NL*
him
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
begin
to
love
him
as
a
brother
;
and
his
constant
*NL*
and
deep
grief
fills
me
with
sympathy
and
compassion
.
He
must
have
been
*NL*
a
noble
creature
in
his
better
days
,
being
even
now
in
wreck
so
*NL*
attractive
and
amiable
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
in
one
of
my
letters
,
my
dear
Margaret
,
that
I
should
find
no
*NL*
friend
on
the
wide
ocean
;
yet
I
have
found
a
man
who
,
before
his
spirit
*NL*
had
been
broken
by
misery
,
I
should
have
been
happy
to
have
possessed
as
*NL*
the
brother
of
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
continue
my
journal
concerning
the
stranger
at
intervals
,
should
*NL*
I
have
any
fresh
incidents
to
record
.

August

*NL*
*NL*
My
affection
for
my
guest
increases
every
day
.
He
excites
at
once
my
*NL*
admiration
and
my
pity
to
an
astonishing
degree
.
How
can
I
see
so
noble
*NL*
a
creature
destroyed
by
misery
without
feeling
the
most
poignant
grief
?
*NL*
He
is
so
gentle
,
yet
so
wise
;
his
mind
is
so
cultivated
;
and
when
he
*NL*
speaks
,
although
his
words
are
culled
with
the
choicest
art
,
yet
they
*NL*
flow
with
rapidity
and
unparalleled
eloquence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
now
much
recovered
from
his
illness
,
and
is
continually
on
the
*NL*
deck
,
apparently
watching
for
the
sledge
that
preceded
his
own
.
Yet
,
*NL*
although
unhappy
,
he
is
not
so
utterly
occupied
by
his
own
misery
,
but
*NL*
that
he
interests
himself
deeply
in
the
employments
of
others
.
He
has
*NL*
asked
me
many
questions
concerning
my
design
;
and
I
have
related
my
*NL*
little
history
frankly
to
him
.
He
appeared
pleased
with
the
confidence
,
*NL*
and
suggested
several
alterations
in
my
plan
,
which
I
shall
find
*NL*
exceedingly
useful
.
There
is
no
pedantry
in
his
manner
;
but
all
he
does
*NL*
appears
to
spring
solely
from
the
interest
he
instinctively
takes
in
the
*NL*
welfare
of
those
who
surround
him
.
He
is
often
overcome
by
gloom
,
and
*NL*
then
he
sits
by
himself
,
and
tries
to
overcome
all
that
is
sullen
or
*NL*
unsocial
in
his
humour
.
These
paroxysms
pass
from
him
like
a
cloud
from
*NL*
before
the
sun
,
though
his
dejection
never
leaves
him
.
I
have
*NL*
endeavoured
to
win
his
confidence
;
and
I
trust
that
I
have
succeeded
.
*NL*
One
day
I
mentioned
to
him
the
desire
I
had
always
felt
of
finding
a
*NL*
friend
who
might
sympathize
with
me
,
and
direct
me
by
his
counsel
.
I
*NL*
said
,
I
did
not
belong
to
that
class
of
men
who
are
offended
by
advice
.
*NL*
``
I
am
self-educated
,
and
perhaps
I
hardly
rely
sufficiently
upon
my
own
*NL*
powers
.
I
wish
therefore
that
my
companion
should
be
wiser
and
more
*NL*
experienced
than
myself
,
to
confirm
and
support
me
;
nor
have
I
believed
*NL*
it
impossible
to
find
a
true
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
with
you
,
''
replied
the
stranger
,
``
in
believing
that
friendship
*NL*
is
not
only
a
desirable
,
but
a
possible
acquisition
.
I
once
had
a
*NL*
friend
,
the
most
noble
of
human
creatures
,
and
am
entitled
,
therefore
,
*NL*
to
judge
respecting
friendship
.
You
have
hope
,
and
the
world
before
you
,
*NL*
and
have
no
cause
for
despair
.
But
I
--
I
have
lost
every
thing
,
and
*NL*
can
not
begin
life
anew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
,
his
countenance
became
expressive
of
a
calm
settled
*NL*
grief
,
that
touched
me
to
the
heart
.
But
he
was
silent
,
and
presently
*NL*
retired
to
his
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
broken
in
spirit
as
he
is
,
no
one
can
feel
more
deeply
than
he
does
*NL*
the
beauties
of
nature
.
The
starry
sky
,
the
sea
,
and
every
sight
*NL*
afforded
by
these
wonderful
regions
,
seems
still
to
have
the
power
of
*NL*
elevating
his
soul
from
earth
.
Such
a
man
has
a
double
existence
:
he
may
*NL*
suffer
misery
,
and
be
overwhelmed
by
disappointments
;
yet
when
he
has
*NL*
retired
into
himself
,
he
will
be
like
a
celestial
spirit
,
that
has
a
*NL*
halo
around
him
,
within
whose
circle
no
grief
or
folly
ventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
you
laugh
at
the
enthusiasm
I
express
concerning
this
divine
*NL*
wanderer
?
If
you
do
,
you
must
have
certainly
lost
that
simplicity
which
*NL*
was
once
your
characteristic
charm
.
Yet
,
if
you
will
,
smile
at
the
*NL*
warmth
of
my
expressions
,
while
I
find
every
day
new
causes
for
*NL*
repeating
them
.

*NL*
Yesterday
the
stranger
said
to
me
,
``
You
may
easily
perceive
,
Captain
*NL*
Walton
,
that
I
have
suffered
great
and
unparalleled
misfortunes
.
I
had
*NL*
determined
,
once
,
that
the
memory
of
these
evils
should
die
with
me
;
but
*NL*
you
have
won
me
to
alter
my
determination
.
You
seek
for
knowledge
and
*NL*
wisdom
,
as
I
once
did
;
and
I
ardently
hope
that
the
gratification
of
*NL*
your
wishes
may
not
be
a
serpent
to
sting
you
,
as
mine
has
been
.
I
do
*NL*
not
know
that
the
relation
of
my
misfortunes
will
be
useful
to
you
,
yet
,
*NL*
if
you
are
inclined
,
listen
to
my
tale
.
I
believe
that
the
strange
*NL*
incidents
connected
with
it
will
afford
a
view
of
nature
,
which
may
*NL*
enlarge
your
faculties
and
understanding
.
You
will
hear
of
powers
and
*NL*
occurrences
,
such
as
you
have
been
accustomed
to
believe
impossible
:
but
*NL*
I
do
not
doubt
that
my
tale
conveys
in
its
series
internal
evidence
of
*NL*
the
truth
of
the
events
of
which
it
is
composed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
easily
conceive
that
I
was
much
gratified
by
the
offered
*NL*
communication
;
yet
I
could
not
endure
that
he
should
renew
his
grief
by
*NL*
a
recital
of
his
misfortunes
.
I
felt
the
greatest
eagerness
to
hear
the
*NL*
promised
narrative
,
partly
from
curiosity
,
and
partly
from
a
strong
*NL*
desire
to
ameliorate
his
fate
,
if
it
were
in
my
power
.
I
expressed
these
*NL*
feelings
in
my
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
''
he
replied
,
``
for
your
sympathy
,
but
it
is
useless
;
my
*NL*
fate
is
nearly
fulfilled
.
I
wait
but
for
one
event
,
and
then
I
shall
*NL*
repose
in
peace
.
I
understand
your
feeling
,
''
continued
he
,
perceiving
*NL*
that
I
wished
to
interrupt
him
;
``
but
you
are
mistaken
,
my
friend
,
if
*NL*
thus
you
will
allow
me
to
name
you
;
nothing
can
alter
my
destiny
:
listen
*NL*
to
my
history
,
and
you
will
perceive
how
irrevocably
it
is
determined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
told
me
,
that
he
would
commence
his
narrative
the
next
day
when
*NL*
I
should
be
at
leisure
.
This
promise
drew
from
me
the
warmest
thanks
.
I
*NL*
have
resolved
every
night
,
when
I
am
not
engaged
,
to
record
,
as
nearly
*NL*
as
possible
in
his
own
words
,
what
he
has
related
during
the
day
.
If
I
*NL*
should
be
engaged
,
I
will
at
least
make
notes
.
This
manuscript
will
*NL*
doubtless
afford
you
the
greatest
pleasure
:

to
me
,
who
know
him
,
and
*NL*
who
hear
it
from
his
own
lips

with
what
interest

shall
I

read
it
in

CHAPTER
I.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
by
birth
a
Genevese
;
and
my
family
is
one
of
the
most
distinguished
*NL*
of
that
republic
.
My
ancestors
had
been
for
many
years
counsellors
and
*NL*
syndics
;
and
my
father
had
filled
several
public
situations
with
honour
*NL*
and
reputation
.
He
was
respected
by
all
who
knew
him
for
his
integrity
*NL*
and
indefatigable
attention
to
public
business
.
He
passed
his
younger
*NL*
days
perpetually
occupied
by
the
affairs
of
his
country
;
and
it
was
not
*NL*
until
the
decline
of
life
that
he
thought
of
marrying
,
and
bestowing
on
*NL*
the
state
sons
who
might
carry
his
virtues
and
his
name
down
to
*NL*
posterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
circumstances
of
his
marriage
illustrate
his
character
,
I
can
not
*NL*
refrain
from
relating
them
.
One
of
his
most
intimate
friends
was
a
*NL*
merchant
,
who
,
from
a
flourishing
state
,
fell
,
through
numerous
*NL*
mischances
,
into
poverty
.
This
man
,
whose
name
was
Beaufort
,
was
of
a
*NL*
proud
and
unbending
disposition
,
and
could
not
bear
to
live
in
poverty
*NL*
and
oblivion
in
the
same
country
where
he
had
formerly
been
*NL*
distinguished
for
his
rank
and
magnificence
.
Having
paid
his
debts
,
*NL*
therefore
,
in
the
most
honourable
manner
,
he
retreated
with
his
daughter
*NL*
to
the
town
of
Lucerne
,
where
he
lived
unknown
and
in
wretchedness
.
My
*NL*
father
loved
Beaufort
with
the
truest
friendship
,
and
was
deeply
grieved
*NL*
by
his
retreat
in
these
unfortunate
circumstances
.
He
grieved
also
for
*NL*
the
loss
of
his
society
,
and
resolved
to
seek
him
out
and
endeavour
to
*NL*
persuade
him
to
begin
the
world
again
through
his
credit
and
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beaufort
had
taken
effectual
measures
to
conceal
himself
;
and
it
was
ten
*NL*
months
before
my
father
discovered
his
abode
.
Overjoyed
at
this
*NL*
discovery
,
he
hastened
to
the
house
,
which
was
situated
in
a
mean
*NL*
street
,
near
the
Reuss
.
But
when
he
entered
,
misery
and
despair
alone
*NL*
welcomed
him
.
Beaufort
had
saved
but
a
very
small
sum
of
money
from
the
*NL*
wreck
of
his
fortunes
;
but
it
was
sufficient
to
provide
him
with
*NL*
sustenance
for
some
months
,
and
in
the
mean
time
he
hoped
to
procure
*NL*
some
respectable
employment
in
a
merchant
's
house
.
The
interval
was
*NL*
consequently
spent
in
inaction
;
his
grief
only
became
more
deep
and
*NL*
rankling
,
when
he
had
leisure
for
reflection
;
and
at
length
it
took
so
*NL*
fast
hold
of
his
mind
,
that
at
the
end
of
three
months
he
lay
on
a
bed
*NL*
of
sickness
,
incapable
of
any
exertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
daughter
attended
him
with
the
greatest
tenderness
;
but
she
saw
with
*NL*
despair
that
their
little
fund
was
rapidly
decreasing
,
and
that
there
*NL*
was
no
other
prospect
of
support
.
But
Caroline
Beaufort
possessed
a
mind
*NL*
of
an
uncommon
mould
;
and
her
courage
rose
to
support
her
in
her
*NL*
adversity
.
She
procured
plain
work
;
she
plaited
straw
;
and
by
various
*NL*
means
contrived
to
earn
a
pittance
scarcely
sufficient
to
support
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
months
passed
in
this
manner
.
Her
father
grew
worse
;
her
time
*NL*
was
more
entirely
occupied
in
attending
him
;
her
means
of
subsistence
*NL*
decreased
;
and
in
the
tenth
month
her
father
died
in
her
arms
,
leaving
*NL*
her
an
orphan
and
a
beggar
.
This
last
blow
overcame
her
;
and
she
knelt
*NL*
by
Beaufort
's
coffin
,
weeping
bitterly
,
when
my
father
entered
the
*NL*
chamber
.
He
came
like
a
protecting
spirit
to
the
poor
girl
,
who
*NL*
committed
herself
to
his
care
,
and
after
the
interment
of
his
friend
he
*NL*
conducted
her
to
Geneva
,
and
placed
her
under
the
protection
of
a
*NL*
relation
.
Two
years
after
this
event
Caroline
became
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
father
became
a
husband
and
a
parent
,
he
found
his
time
so
*NL*
occupied
by
the
duties
of
his
new
situation
,
that
he
relinquished
many
*NL*
of
his
public
employments
,
and
devoted
himself
to
the
education
of
his
*NL*
children
.
Of
these
I
was
the
eldest
,
and
the
destined
successor
to
all
*NL*
his
labours
and
utility
.
No
creature
could
have
more
tender
parents
than
*NL*
mine
.
My
improvement
and
health
were
their
constant
care
,
especially
as
*NL*
I
remained
for
several
years
their
only
child
.
But
before
I
continue
my
*NL*
narrative
,
I
must
record
an
incident
which
took
place
when
I
was
four
*NL*
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
had
a
sister
,
whom
he
tenderly
loved
,
and
who
had
married
*NL*
early
in
life
an
Italian
gentleman
.
Soon
after
her
marriage
,
she
had
*NL*
accompanied
her
husband
into
her
native
country
,
and
for
some
years
my
*NL*
father
had
very
little
communication
with
her
.
About
the
time
I
*NL*
mentioned
she
died
;
and
a
few
months
afterwards
he
received
a
letter
*NL*
from
her
husband
,
acquainting
him
with
his
intention
of
marrying
an
*NL*
Italian
lady
,
and
requesting
my
father
to
take
charge
of
the
infant
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
the
only
child
of
his
deceased
sister
.
``
It
is
my
wish
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
that
you
should
consider
her
as
your
own
daughter
,
and
educate
*NL*
her
thus
.
Her
mother
's
fortune
is
secured
to
her
,
the
documents
of
which
*NL*
I
will
commit
to
your
keeping
.
Reflect
upon
this
proposition
;
and
decide
*NL*
whether
you
would
prefer
educating
your
niece
yourself
to
her
being
*NL*
brought
up
by
a
stepmother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
did
not
hestitate
,
and
immediately
went
to
Italy
,
that
he
*NL*
might
accompany
the
little
Elizabeth
to
her
future
home
.
I
have
often
*NL*
heard
my
mother
say
,
that
she
was
at
that
time
the
most
beautiful
child
*NL*
she
had
ever
seen
,
and
shewed
signs
even
then
of
a
gentle
and
*NL*
affectionate
disposition
.
These
indications
,
and
a
desire
to
bind
as
*NL*
closely
as
possible
the
ties
of
domestic
love
,
determined
my
mother
to
*NL*
consider
Elizabeth
as
my
future
wife
;
a
design
which
she
never
found
*NL*
reason
to
repent
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
time
Elizabeth
Lavenza
became
my
playfellow
,
and
,
as
we
grew
*NL*
older
,
my
friend
.
She
was
docile
and
good
tempered
,
yet
gay
and
playful
*NL*
as
a
summer
insect
.
Although
she
was
lively
and
animated
,
her
feelings
*NL*
were
strong
and
deep
,
and
her
disposition
uncommonly
affectionate
.
No
*NL*
one
could
better
enjoy
liberty
,
yet
no
one
could
submit
with
more
grace
*NL*
than
she
did
to
constraint
and
caprice
.
Her
imagination
was
luxuriant
,
*NL*
yet
her
capability
of
application
was
great
.
Her
person
was
the
image
of
*NL*
her
mind
;
her
hazel
eyes
,
although
as
lively
as
a
bird
's
,
possessed
an
*NL*
attractive
softness
.
Her
figure
was
light
and
airy
;
and
,
though
capable
*NL*
of
enduring
great
fatigue
,
she
appeared
the
most
fragile
creature
in
the
*NL*
world
.
While
I
admired
her
understanding
and
fancy
,
I
loved
to
tend
on
*NL*
her
,
as
I
should
on
a
favourite
animal
;
and
I
never
saw
so
much
grace
*NL*
both
of
person
and
mind
united
to
so
little
pretension
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
adored
Elizabeth
.
If
the
servants
had
any
request
to
make
,
it
*NL*
was
always
through
her
intercession
.
We
were
strangers
to
any
species
of
*NL*
disunion
and
dispute
;
for
although
there
was
a
great
dissimilitude
in
*NL*
our
characters
,
there
was
an
harmony
in
that
very
dissimilitude
.
I
was
*NL*
more
calm
and
philosophical
than
my
companion
;
yet
my
temper
was
not
so
*NL*
yielding
.
My
application
was
of
longer
endurance
;
but
it
was
not
so
*NL*
severe
whilst
it
endured
.
I
delighted
in
investigating
the
facts
*NL*
relative
to
the
actual
world
;
she
busied
herself
in
following
the
aerial
*NL*
creations
of
the
poets
.
The
world
was
to
me
a
secret
,
which
I
desired
to
*NL*
discover
;
to
her
it
was
a
vacancy
,
which
she
sought
to
people
with
*NL*
imaginations
of
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
brothers
were
considerably
younger
than
myself
;
but
I
had
a
friend
*NL*
in
one
of
my
schoolfellows
,
who
compensated
for
this
deficiency
.
Henry
*NL*
Clerval
was
the
son
of
a
merchant
of
Geneva
,
an
intimate
friend
of
my
*NL*
father
.
He
was
a
boy
of
singular
talent
and
fancy
.
I
remember
,
when
he
*NL*
was
nine
years
old
,
he
wrote
a
fairy
tale
,
which
was
the
delight
and
*NL*
amazement
of
all
his
companions
.
His
favourite
study
consisted
in
books
*NL*
of
chivalry
and
romance
;
and
when
very
young
,
I
can
remember
,
that
we
*NL*
used
to
act
plays
composed
by
him
out
of
these
favourite
books
,
the
*NL*
principal
characters
of
which
were
Orlando
,
Robin
Hood
,
Amadis
,
and
St.
*NL*
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
youth
could
have
passed
more
happily
than
mine
.
My
parents
were
*NL*
indulgent
,
and
my
companions
amiable
.
Our
studies
were
never
forced
;
and
*NL*
by
some
means
we
always
had
an
end
placed
in
view
,
which
excited
us
to
*NL*
ardour
in
the
prosecution
of
them
.
It
was
by
this
method
,
and
not
by
*NL*
emulation
,
that
we
were
urged
to
application
.
Elizabeth
was
not
incited
*NL*
to
apply
herself
to
drawing
,
that
her
companions
might
not
outstrip
her
;
*NL*
but
through
the
desire
of
pleasing
her
aunt
,
by
the
representation
of
*NL*
some
favourite
scene
done
by
her
own
hand
.
We
learned
Latin
and
English
,
*NL*
that
we
might
read
the
writings
in
those
languages
;
and
so
far
from
*NL*
study
being
made
odious
to
us
through
punishment
,
we
loved
application
,
*NL*
and
our
amusements
would
have
been
the
labours
of
other
children
.
*NL*
Perhaps
we
did
not
read
so
many
books
,
or
learn
languages
so
quickly
,
as
*NL*
those
who
are
disciplined
according
to
the
ordinary
methods
;
but
what
*NL*
we
learned
was
impressed
the
more
deeply
on
our
memories
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
description
of
our
domestic
circle
I
include
Henry
Clerval
;
for
*NL*
he
was
constantly
with
us
.
He
went
to
school
with
me
,
and
generally
*NL*
passed
the
afternoon
at
our
house
;
for
being
an
only
child
,
and
*NL*
destitute
of
companions
at
home
,
his
father
was
well
pleased
that
he
*NL*
should
find
associates
at
our
house
;
and
we
were
never
completely
happy
*NL*
when
Clerval
was
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
feel
pleasure
in
dwelling
on
the
recollections
of
childhood
,
before
*NL*
misfortune
had
tainted
my
mind
,
and
changed
its
bright
visions
of
*NL*
extensive
usefulness
into
gloomy
and
narrow
reflections
upon
self
.
But
,
*NL*
in
drawing
the
picture
of
my
early
days
,
I
must
not
omit
to
record
those
*NL*
events
which
led
,
by
insensible
steps
to
my
after
tale
of
misery
:
for
*NL*
when
I
would
account
to
myself
for
the
birth
of
that
passion
,
which
*NL*
afterwards
ruled
my
destiny
,
I
find
it
arise
,
like
a
mountain
river
,
*NL*
from
ignoble
and
almost
forgotten
sources
;
but
,
swelling
as
it
*NL*
proceeded
,
it
became
the
torrent
which
,
in
its
course
,
has
swept
away
*NL*
all
my
hopes
and
joys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natural
philosophy
is
the
genius
that
has
regulated
my
fate
;
I
desire
*NL*
therefore
,
in
this
narration
,
to
state
those
facts
which
led
to
my
*NL*
predilection
for
that
science
.
When
I
was
thirteen
years
of
age
,
we
all
*NL*
went
on
a
party
of
pleasure
to
the
baths
near
Thonon
:
the
inclemency
of
*NL*
the
weather
obliged
us
to
remain
a
day
confined
to
the
inn
.
In
this
*NL*
house
I
chanced
to
find
a
volume
of
the
works
of
Cornelius
Agrippa
.
I
*NL*
opened
it
with
apathy
;
the
theory
which
he
attempts
to
demonstrate
,
and
*NL*
the
wonderful
facts
which
he
relates
,
soon
changed
this
feeling
into
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
A
new
light
seemed
to
dawn
upon
my
mind
;
and
,
bounding
with
*NL*
joy
,
I
communicated
my
discovery
to
my
father
.
I
can
not
help
remarking
*NL*
here
the
many
opportunities
instructors
possess
of
directing
the
*NL*
attention
of
their
pupils
to
useful
knowledge
,
which
they
utterly
*NL*
neglect
.
My
father
looked
carelessly
at
the
title-page
of
my
book
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Ah
!
Cornelius
Agrippa
!
My
dear
Victor
,
do
not
waste
your
time
*NL*
upon
this
;
it
is
sad
trash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
instead
of
this
remark
,
my
father
had
taken
the
pains
,
to
explain
to
*NL*
me
,
that
the
principles
of
Agrippa
had
been
entirely
exploded
,
and
that
*NL*
a
modern
system
of
science
had
been
introduced
,
which
possessed
much
*NL*
greater
powers
than
the
ancient
,
because
the
powers
of
the
latter
were
*NL*
chimerical
,
while
those
of
the
former
were
real
and
practical
;
under
*NL*
such
circumstances
,
I
should
certainly
have
thrown
Agrippa
aside
,
and
,
*NL*
with
my
imagination
warmed
as
it
was
,
should
probably
have
applied
*NL*
myself
to
the
more
rational
theory
of
chemistry
which
has
resulted
from
*NL*
modern
discoveries
.
It
is
even
possible
,
that
the
train
of
my
ideas
*NL*
would
never
have
received
the
fatal
impulse
that
led
to
my
ruin
.
But
the
*NL*
cursory
glance
my
father
had
taken
of
my
volume
by
no
means
assured
me
*NL*
that
he
was
acquainted
with
its
contents
;
and
I
continued
to
read
with
*NL*
the
greatest
avidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
returned
home
,
my
first
care
was
to
procure
the
whole
works
of
*NL*
this
author
,
and
afterwards
of
Paracelsus
and
Albertus
Magnus
.
I
read
*NL*
and
studied
the
wild
fancies
of
these
writers
with
delight
;
they
*NL*
appeared
to
me
treasures
known
to
few
beside
myself
;
and
although
I
*NL*
often
wished
to
communicate
these
secret
stores
of
knowledge
to
my
*NL*
father
,
yet
his
indefinite
censure
of
my
favourite
Agrippa
always
*NL*
withheld
me
.
I
disclosed
my
discoveries
to
Elizabeth
,
therefore
,
under
a
*NL*
promise
of
strict
secrecy
;
but
she
did
not
interest
herself
in
the
*NL*
subject
,
and
I
was
left
by
her
to
pursue
my
studies
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
appear
very
strange
,
that
a
disciple
of
Albertus
Magnus
should
*NL*
arise
in
the
eighteenth
century
;
but
our
family
was
not
scientifical
,
*NL*
and
I
had
not
attended
any
of
the
lectures
given
at
the
schools
of
*NL*
Geneva
.
My
dreams
were
therefore
undisturbed
by
reality
;
and
I
entered
*NL*
with
the
greatest
diligence
into
the
search
of
the
philosopher
's
stone
*NL*
and
the
elixir
of
life
.
But
the
latter
obtained
my
most
undivided
*NL*
attention
:
wealth
was
an
inferior
object
;
but
what
glory
would
attend
*NL*
the
discovery
,
if
I
could
banish
disease
from
the
human
frame
,
and
*NL*
render
man
invulnerable
to
any
but
a
violent
death
!
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
were
these
my
only
visions
.
The
raising
of
ghosts
or
devils
was
a
*NL*
promise
liberally
accorded
by
my
favourite
authors
,
the
fulfilment
of
*NL*
which
I
most
eagerly
sought
;
and
if
my
incantations
were
always
*NL*
unsuccessful
,
I
attributed
the
failure
rather
to
my
own
inexperience
and
*NL*
mistake
,
than
to
a
want
of
skill
or
fidelity
in
my
instructors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
natural
phaenomena
that
take
place
every
day
before
our
eyes
did
not
*NL*
escape
my
examinations
.
Distillation
,
and
the
wonderful
effects
of
*NL*
steam
,
processes
of
which
my
favourite
authors
were
utterly
ignorant
,
*NL*
excited
my
astonishment
;
but
my
utmost
wonder
was
engaged
by
some
*NL*
experiments
on
an
air-pump
,
which
I
saw
employed
by
a
gentleman
whom
we
*NL*
were
in
the
habit
of
visiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ignorance
of
the
early
philosophers
on
these
and
several
other
*NL*
points
served
to
decrease
their
credit
with
me
:
but
I
could
not
entirely
*NL*
throw
them
aside
,
before
some
other
system
should
occupy
their
place
in
*NL*
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
about
fifteen
years
old
,
we
had
retired
to
our
house
near
*NL*
Belrive
,
when
we
witnessed
a
most
violent
and
terrible
thunder-storm
.
It
*NL*
advanced
from
behind
the
mountains
of
Jura
;
and
the
thunder
burst
at
*NL*
once
with
frightful
loudness
from
various
quarters
of
the
heavens
.
I
*NL*
remained
,
while
the
storm
lasted
,
watching
its
progress
with
curiosity
*NL*
and
delight
.
As
I
stood
at
the
door
,
on
a
sudden
I
beheld
a
stream
of
*NL*
fire
issue
from
an
old
and
beautiful
oak
,
which
stood
about
twenty
yards
*NL*
from
our
house
;
and
so
soon
as
the
dazzling
light
vanished
,
the
oak
had
*NL*
disappeared
,
and
nothing
remained
but
a
blasted
stump
.
When
we
visited
*NL*
it
the
next
morning
,
we
found
the
tree
shattered
in
a
singular
manner
.
*NL*
It
was
not
splintered
by
the
shock
,
but
entirely
reduced
to
thin
*NL*
ribbands
of
wood
.
I
never
beheld
any
thing
so
utterly
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
catastrophe
of
this
tree
excited
my
extreme
astonishment
;
and
I
*NL*
eagerly
inquired
of
my
father
the
nature
and
origin
of
thunder
and
*NL*
lightning
.
He
replied
,
``
Electricity

describing
at
the
same
time
the
*NL*
various
effects
of
that
power
.
He
constructed
a
small
electrical
*NL*
machine
,
and
exhibited
a
few
experiments
;
he
made
also
a
kite
,
with
a
*NL*
wire
and
string
,
which
drew
down
that
fluid
from
the
clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
stroke
completed
the
overthrow
of
Cornelius
Agrippa
,
Albertus
*NL*
Magnus
,
and
Paracelsus
,
who
had
so
long
reigned
the
lords
of
my
*NL*
imagination
.
But
by
some
fatality
I
did
not
feel
inclined
to
commence
*NL*
the
study
of
any
modern
system
;
and
this
disinclination
was
influenced
*NL*
by
the
following
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
expressed
a
wish
that
I
should
attend
a
course
of
lectures
*NL*
upon
natural
philosophy
,
to
which
I
cheerfully
consented
.
Some
accident
*NL*
prevented
my
attending
these
lectures
until
the
course
was
nearly
*NL*
finished
.
The
lecture
,
being
therefore
one
of
the
last
,
was
entirely
*NL*
incomprehensible
to
me
.
The
professor
discoursed
with
the
greatest
*NL*
fluency
of
potassium
and
boron
,
of
sulphates
and
oxyds
,
terms
to
which
I
*NL*
could
affix
no
idea
;
and
I
became
disgusted
with
the
science
of
natural
*NL*
philosophy
,
although
I
still
read
Pliny
and
Buffon
with
delight
,
*NL*
authors
,
in
my
estimation
,
of
nearly
equal
interest
and
utility
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
occupations
at
this
age
were
principally
the
mathematics
,
and
most
of
*NL*
the
branches
of
study
appertaining
to
that
science
.
I
was
busily
*NL*
employed
in
learning
languages
;
Latin
was
already
familiar
to
me
,
and
I
*NL*
began
to
read
some
of
the
easiest
Greek
authors
without
the
help
of
a
*NL*
lexicon
.
I
also
perfectly
understood
English
and
German
.
This
is
the
*NL*
list
of
my
accomplishments
at
the
age
of
seventeen
;
and
you
may
conceive
*NL*
that
my
hours
were
fully
employed
in
acquiring
and
maintaining
a
*NL*
knowledge
of
this
various
literature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
task
also
devolved
upon
me
,
when
I
became
the
instructor
of
my
*NL*
brothers
.
Ernest
was
six
years
younger
than
myself
,
and
was
my
principal
*NL*
pupil
.
He
had
been
afflicted
with
ill
health
from
his
infancy
,
through
*NL*
which
Elizabeth
and
I
had
been
his
constant
nurses
:
his
disposition
was
*NL*
gentle
,
but
he
was
incapable
of
any
severe
application
.
William
,
the
*NL*
youngest
of
our
family
,
was
yet
an
infant
,
and
the
most
beautiful
little
*NL*
fellow
in
the
world
;
his
lively
blue
eyes
,
dimpled
cheeks
,
and
endearing
*NL*
manners
,
inspired
the
tenderest
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
our
domestic
circle
,
from
which
care
and
pain
seemed
for
ever
*NL*
banished
.
My
father
directed
our
studies
,
and
my
mother
partook
of
our
*NL*
enjoyments
.
Neither
of
us
possessed
the
slightest
pre-eminence
over
the
*NL*
other
;
the
voice
of
command
was
never
heard
amongst
us
;
but
mutual
*NL*
affection
engaged
us
all
to
comply
with
and
obey
the
slightest
desire
of
*NL*
each
other
.

CHAPTER
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
attained
the
age
of
seventeen
,
my
parents
resolved
that
I
*NL*
should
become
a
student
at
the
university
of
Ingolstadt
.
I
had
hitherto
*NL*
attended
the
schools
of
Geneva
;
but
my
father
thought
it
necessary
,
for
*NL*
the
completion
of
my
education
,
that
I
should
be
made
acquainted
with
*NL*
other
customs
than
those
of
my
native
country
.
My
departure
was
*NL*
therefore
fixed
at
an
early
date
;
but
,
before
the
day
resolved
upon
*NL*
could
arrive
,
the
first
misfortune
of
my
life
occurred
--
an
omen
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
of
my
future
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
caught
the
scarlet
fever
;
but
her
illness
was
not
severe
,
*NL*
and
she
quickly
recovered
.
During
her
confinement
,
many
arguments
had
*NL*
been
urged
to
persuade
my
mother
to
refrain
from
attending
upon
her
.
She
*NL*
had
,
at
first
,
yielded
to
our
entreaties
;
but
when
she
heard
that
her
*NL*
favourite
was
recovering
,
she
could
no
longer
debar
herself
from
her
*NL*
society
,
and
entered
her
chamber
long
before
the
danger
of
infection
was
*NL*
past
.
The
consequences
of
this
imprudence
were
fatal
.
On
the
third
day
*NL*
my
mother
sickened
;
her
fever
was
very
malignant
,
and
the
looks
of
her
*NL*
attendants
prognosticated
the
worst
event
.
On
her
death-bed
the
*NL*
fortitude
and
benignity
of
this
admirable
woman
did
not
desert
her
.
She
*NL*
joined
the
hands
of
Elizabeth
and
myself
:
``
My
children
,
''
she
said
,
``
my
*NL*
firmest
hopes
of
future
happiness
were
placed
on
the
prospect
of
your
*NL*
union
.
This
expectation
will
now
be
the
consolation
of
your
father
.
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
my
love
,
you
must
supply
my
place
to
your
younger
cousins
.
*NL*
Alas
!
I
regret
that
I
am
taken
from
you
;
and
,
happy
and
beloved
as
I
*NL*
have
been
,
is
it
not
hard
to
quit
you
all
?
But
these
are
not
thoughts
*NL*
befitting
me
;
I
will
endeavour
to
resign
myself
cheerfully
to
death
,
and
*NL*
will
indulge
a
hope
of
meeting
you
in
another
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
died
calmly
;
and
her
countenance
expressed
affection
even
in
death
.
*NL*
I
need
not
describe
the
feelings
of
those
whose
dearest
ties
are
rent
by
*NL*
that
most
irreparable
evil
,
the
void
that
presents
itself
to
the
soul
,
*NL*
and
the
despair
that
is
exhibited
on
the
countenance
.
It
is
so
long
*NL*
before
the
mind
can
persuade
itself
that
she
,
whom
we
saw
every
day
,
and
*NL*
whose
very
existence
appeared
a
part
of
our
own
,
can
have
departed
for
*NL*
ever
--
that
the
brightness
of
a
beloved
eye
can
have
been
extinguished
,
*NL*
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
so
familiar
,
and
dear
to
the
ear
,
can
be
*NL*
hushed
,
never
more
to
be
heard
.
These
are
the
reflections
of
the
first
*NL*
days
;
but
when
the
lapse
of
time
proves
the
reality
of
the
evil
,
then
*NL*
the
actual
bitterness
of
grief
commences
.
Yet
from
whom
has
not
that
*NL*
rude
hand
rent
away
some
dear
connexion
;
and
why
should
I
describe
a
*NL*
sorrow
which
all
have
felt
,
and
must
feel
?
The
time
at
length
arrives
,
*NL*
when
grief
is
rather
an
indulgence
than
a
necessity
;
and
the
smile
that
*NL*
plays
upon
the
lips
,
although
it
may
be
deemed
a
sacrilege
,
is
not
*NL*
banished
.
My
mother
was
dead
,
but
we
had
still
duties
which
we
ought
to
*NL*
perform
;
we
must
continue
our
course
with
the
rest
,
and
learn
to
think
*NL*
ourselves
fortunate
,
whilst
one
remains
whom
the
spoiler
has
not
seized
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
journey
to
Ingolstadt
,
which
had
been
deferred
by
these
events
,
was
*NL*
now
again
determined
upon
.
I
obtained
from
my
father
a
respite
of
some
*NL*
weeks
.
This
period
was
spent
sadly
;
my
mother
's
death
,
and
my
speedy
*NL*
departure
,
depressed
our
spirits
;
but
Elizabeth
endeavoured
to
renew
the
*NL*
spirit
of
cheerfulness
in
our
little
society
.
Since
the
death
of
her
*NL*
aunt
,
her
mind
had
acquired
new
firmness
and
vigour
.
She
determined
to
*NL*
fulfil
her
duties
with
the
greatest
exactness
;
and
she
felt
that
that
*NL*
most
imperious
duty
,
of
rendering
her
uncle
and
cousins
happy
,
had
*NL*
devolved
upon
her
.
She
consoled
me
,
amused
her
uncle
,
instructed
my
*NL*
brothers
;
and
I
never
beheld
her
so
enchanting
as
at
this
time
,
when
she
*NL*
was
continually
endeavouring
to
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
others
,
*NL*
entirely
forgetful
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
of
my
departure
at
length
arrived
.
I
had
taken
leave
of
all
my
*NL*
friends
,
excepting
Clerval
,
who
spent
the
last
evening
with
us
.
He
*NL*
bitterly
lamented
that
he
was
unable
to
accompany
me
:
but
his
father
*NL*
could
not
be
persuaded
to
part
with
him
,
intending
that
he
should
become
*NL*
a
partner
with
him
in
business
,
in
compliance
with
his
favourite
theory
,
*NL*
that
learning
was
superfluous
in
the
commerce
of
ordinary
life
.
Henry
*NL*
had
a
refined
mind
;
he
had
no
desire
to
be
idle
,
and
was
well
pleased
to
*NL*
become
his
father
's
partner
,
but
he
believed
that
a
man
might
be
a
very
*NL*
good
trader
,
and
yet
possess
a
cultivated
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
late
,
listening
to
his
complaints
,
and
making
many
little
*NL*
arrangements
for
the
future
.
The
next
morning
early
I
departed
.
Tears
*NL*
gushed
from
the
eyes
of
Elizabeth
;
they
proceeded
partly
from
sorrow
at
*NL*
my
departure
,
and
partly
because
she
reflected
that
the
same
journey
was
*NL*
to
have
taken
place
three
months
before
,
when
a
mother
's
blessing
would
*NL*
have
accompanied
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
threw
myself
into
the
chaise
that
was
to
convey
me
away
,
and
indulged
*NL*
in
the
most
melancholy
reflections
.
I
,
who
had
ever
been
surrounded
by
*NL*
amiable
companions
,
continually
engaged
in
endeavouring
to
bestow
*NL*
mutual
pleasure
,
I
was
now
alone
.
In
the
university
,
whither
I
was
*NL*
going
,
I
must
form
my
own
friends
,
and
be
my
own
protector
.
My
life
had
*NL*
hitherto
been
remarkably
secluded
and
domestic
;
and
this
had
given
me
*NL*
invincible
repugnance
to
new
countenances
.
I
loved
my
brothers
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
and
Clerval
:
these
were
``
old
familiar
faces
;
''
but
I
believed
*NL*
myself
totally
unfitted
for
the
company
of
strangers
.
Such
were
my
*NL*
reflections
as
I
commenced
my
journey
;
but
as
I
proceeded
,
my
spirits
*NL*
and
hopes
rose
.
I
ardently
desired
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
.
I
had
*NL*
often
,
when
at
home
,
thought
it
hard
to
remain
during
my
youth
cooped
up
*NL*
in
one
place
,
and
had
longed
to
enter
the
world
,
and
take
my
station
*NL*
among
other
human
beings
.
Now
my
desires
were
complied
with
,
and
it
*NL*
would
,
indeed
,
have
been
folly
to
repent
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
sufficient
leisure
for
these
and
many
other
reflections
during
my
*NL*
journey
to
Ingolstadt
,
which
was
long
and
fatiguing
.
At
length
the
high
*NL*
white
steeple
of
the
town
met
my
eyes
.
I
alighted
,
and
was
conducted
to
*NL*
my
solitary
apartment
,
to
spend
the
evening
as
I
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
I
delivered
my
letters
of
introduction
,
and
paid
a
*NL*
visit
to
some
of
the
principal
professors
,
and
among
others
to
M.
*NL*
Krempe
,
professor
of
natural
philosophy
.
He
received
me
with
politeness
,
*NL*
and
asked
me
several
questions
concerning
my
progress
in
the
different
*NL*
branches
of
science
appertaining
to
natural
philosophy
.
I
mentioned
,
it
*NL*
is
true
,
with
fear
and
trembling
,
the
only
authors
I
had
ever
read
upon
*NL*
those
subjects
.
The
professor
stared
:
``
Have
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
really
spent
*NL*
your
time
in
studying
such
nonsense
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
``
Every
minute
,
''
continued
M.
Krempe
with
*NL*
warmth
,
``
every
instant
that
you
have
wasted
on
those
books
is
utterly
*NL*
and
entirely
lost
.
You
have
burdened
your
memory
with
exploded
systems
,
*NL*
and
useless
names
.
Good
God
!
in
what
desert
land
have
you
lived
,
where
*NL*
no
one
was
kind
enough
to
inform
you
that
these
fancies
,
which
you
have
*NL*
so
greedily
imbibed
,
are
a
thousand
years
old
,
and
as
musty
as
they
are
*NL*
ancient
?
I
little
expected
in
this
enlightened
and
scientific
age
to
*NL*
find
a
disciple
of
Albertus
Magnus
and
Paracelsus
.
My
dear
Sir
,
you
must
*NL*
begin
your
studies
entirely
anew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
stept
aside
,
and
wrote
down
a
list
of
several
books
*NL*
treating
of
natural
philosophy
,
which
he
desired
me
to
procure
,
and
*NL*
dismissed
me
,
after
mentioning
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
following
*NL*
week
he
intended
to
commence
a
course
of
lectures
upon
natural
*NL*
philosophy
in
its
general
relations
,
and
that
M.
Waldman
,
a
*NL*
fellow-professor
,
would
lecture
upon
chemistry
the
alternate
days
that
*NL*
he
missed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
home
,
not
disappointed
,
for
I
had
long
considered
those
*NL*
authors
useless
whom
the
professor
had
so
strongly
reprobated
;
but
I
did
*NL*
not
feel
much
inclined
to
study
the
books
which
I
procured
at
his
*NL*
recommendation
.
M.
Krempe
was
a
little
squat
man
,
with
a
gruff
voice
and
*NL*
repulsive
countenance
;
the
teacher
,
therefore
,
did
not
prepossess
me
in
*NL*
favour
of
his
doctrine
.
Besides
,
I
had
a
contempt
for
the
uses
of
modern
*NL*
natural
philosophy
.
It
was
very
different
,
when
the
masters
of
the
*NL*
science
sought
immortality
and
power
;
such
views
,
although
futile
,
were
*NL*
grand
:
but
now
the
scene
was
changed
.
The
ambition
of
the
inquirer
*NL*
seemed
to
limit
itself
to
the
annihilation
of
those
visions
on
which
my
*NL*
interest
in
science
was
chiefly
founded
.
I
was
required
to
exchange
*NL*
chimeras
of
boundless
grandeur
for
realities
of
little
worth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
my
reflections
during
the
first
two
or
three
days
spent
almost
*NL*
in
solitude
.
But
as
the
ensuing
week
commenced
,
I
thought
of
the
*NL*
information
which
M.
Krempe
had
given
me
concerning
the
lectures
.
And
*NL*
although
I
could
not
consent
to
go
and
hear
that
little
conceited
fellow
*NL*
deliver
sentences
out
of
a
pulpit
,
I
recollected
what
he
had
said
of
M.
*NL*
Waldman
,
whom
I
had
never
seen
,
as
he
had
hitherto
been
out
of
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partly
from
curiosity
,
and
partly
from
idleness
,
I
went
into
the
*NL*
lecturing
room
,
which
M.
Waldman
entered
shortly
after
.
This
professor
*NL*
was
very
unlike
his
colleague
.
He
appeared
about
fifty
years
of
age
,
but
*NL*
with
an
aspect
expressive
of
the
greatest
benevolence
;
a
few
gray
hairs
*NL*
covered
his
temples
,
but
those
at
the
back
of
his
head
were
nearly
*NL*
black
.
His
person
was
short
,
but
remarkably
erect
;
and
his
voice
the
*NL*
sweetest
I
had
ever
heard
.
He
began
his
lecture
by
a
recapitulation
of
*NL*
the
history
of
chemistry
and
the
various
improvements
made
by
different
*NL*
men
of
learning
,
pronouncing
with
fervour
the
names
of
the
most
*NL*
distinguished
discoverers
.
He
then
took
a
cursory
view
of
the
present
*NL*
state
of
the
science
,
and
explained
many
of
its
elementary
terms
.
After
*NL*
having
made
a
few
preparatory
experiments
,
he
concluded
with
a
panegyric
*NL*
upon
modern
chemistry
,
the
terms
of
which
I
shall
never
forget
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ancient
teachers
of
this
science
,
''
said
he
,
``
promised
*NL*
impossibilities
,
and
performed
nothing
.
The
modern
masters
promise
very
*NL*
little
;
they
know
that
metals
can
not
be
transmuted
,
and
that
the
elixir
*NL*
of
life
is
a
chimera
.
But
these
philosophers
,
whose
hands
seem
only
made
*NL*
to
dabble
in
dirt
,
and
their
eyes
to
pour
over
the
microscope
or
*NL*
crucible
,
have
indeed
performed
miracles
.
They
penetrate
into
the
*NL*
recesses
of
nature
,
and
shew
how
she
works
in
her
hiding
places
.
They
*NL*
ascend
into
the
heavens
;
they
have
discovered
how
the
blood
circulates
,
*NL*
and
the
nature
of
the
air
we
breathe
.
They
have
acquired
new
and
almost
*NL*
unlimited
powers
;
they
can
command
the
thunders
of
heaven
,
mimic
the
*NL*
earthquake
,
and
even
mock
the
invisible
world
with
its
own
shadows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
departed
highly
pleased
with
the
professor
and
his
lecture
,
and
paid
*NL*
him
a
visit
the
same
evening
.
His
manners
in
private
were
even
more
mild
*NL*
and
attractive
than
in
public
;
for
there
was
a
certain
dignity
in
his
*NL*
mien
during
his
lecture
,
which
in
his
own
house
was
replaced
by
the
*NL*
greatest
affability
and
kindness
.
He
heard
with
attention
my
little
*NL*
narration
concerning
my
studies
,
and
smiled
at
the
names
of
Cornelius
*NL*
Agrippa
,
and
Paracelsus
,
but
without
the
contempt
that
M.
Krempe
had
*NL*
exhibited
.
He
said
,
that
``
these
were
men
to
whose
indefatigable
zeal
*NL*
modern
philosophers
were
indebted
for
most
of
the
foundations
of
their
*NL*
knowledge
.
They
had
left
to
us
,
as
an
easier
task
,
to
give
new
names
,
*NL*
and
arrange
in
connected
classifications
,
the
facts
which
they
in
a
*NL*
great
degree
had
been
the
instruments
of
bringing
to
light
.
The
labours
*NL*
of
men
of
genius
,
however
erroneously
directed
,
scarcely
ever
fail
in
*NL*
ultimately
turning
to
the
solid
advantage
of
mankind
.
''
I
listened
to
his
*NL*
statement
,
which
was
delivered
without
any
presumption
or
affectation
;
*NL*
and
then
added
,
that
his
lecture
had
removed
my
prejudices
against
*NL*
modern
chemists
;
and
I
,
at
the
same
time
,
requested
his
advice
*NL*
concerning
the
books
I
ought
to
procure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
happy
,
''
said
M.
Waldman
,
``
to
have
gained
a
disciple
;
and
if
your
*NL*
application
equals
your
ability
,
I
have
no
doubt
of
your
success
.
*NL*
Chemistry
is
that
branch
of
natural
philosophy
in
which
the
greatest
*NL*
improvements
have
been
and
may
be
made
;
it
is
on
that
account
that
I
*NL*
have
made
it
my
peculiar
study
;
but
at
the
same
time
I
have
not
*NL*
neglected
the
other
branches
of
science
.
A
man
would
make
but
a
very
*NL*
sorry
chemist
,
if
he
attended
to
that
department
of
human
knowledge
*NL*
alone
.
If
your
wish
is
to
become
really
a
man
of
science
,
and
not
merely
*NL*
a
petty
experimentalist
,
I
should
advise
you
to
apply
to
every
branch
of
*NL*
natural
philosophy
,
including
mathematics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
took
me
into
his
laboratory
,
and
explained
to
me
the
uses
of
*NL*
his
various
machines
;
instructing
me
as
to
what
I
ought
to
procure
,
and
*NL*
promising
me
the
use
of
his
own
,
when
I
should
have
advanced
far
enough
*NL*
in
the
science
not
to
derange
their
mechanism
.
He
also
gave
me
the
list
*NL*
of
books
which
I
had
requested
;
and
I
took
my
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
a
day
memorable
to
me
;
it
decided
my
future
destiny
.

CHAPTER
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
day
natural
philosophy
,
and
particularly
chemistry
,
in
the
*NL*
most
comprehensive
sense
of
the
term
,
became
nearly
my
sole
occupation
.
*NL*
I
read
with
ardour
those
works
,
so
full
of
genius
and
discrimination
,
*NL*
which
modern
inquirers
have
written
on
these
subjects
.
I
attended
the
*NL*
lectures
,
and
cultivated
the
acquaintance
,
of
the
men
of
science
of
the
*NL*
university
;
and
I
found
even
in
M.
Krempe
a
great
deal
of
sound
sense
*NL*
and
real
information
,
combined
,
it
is
true
,
with
a
repulsive
physiognomy
*NL*
and
manners
,
but
not
on
that
account
the
less
valuable
.
In
M.
Waldman
I
*NL*
found
a
true
friend
.
His
gentleness
was
never
tinged
by
dogmatism
;
and
*NL*
his
instructions
were
given
with
an
air
of
frankness
and
good
nature
,
*NL*
that
banished
every
idea
of
pedantry
.
It
was
,
perhaps
,
the
amiable
*NL*
character
of
this
man
that
inclined
me
more
to
that
branch
of
natural
*NL*
philosophy
which
he
professed
,
than
an
intrinsic
love
for
the
science
*NL*
itself
.
But
this
state
of
mind
had
place
only
in
the
first
steps
towards
*NL*
knowledge
:
the
more
fully
I
entered
into
the
science
,
the
more
*NL*
exclusively
I
pursued
it
for
its
own
sake
.
That
application
,
which
at
*NL*
first
had
been
a
matter
of
duty
and
resolution
,
now
became
so
ardent
and
*NL*
eager
,
that
the
stars
often
disappeared
in
the
light
of
morning
whilst
*NL*
I
was
yet
engaged
in
my
laboratory
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
applied
so
closely
,
it
may
be
easily
conceived
that
I
improved
*NL*
rapidly
.
My
ardour
was
indeed
the
astonishment
of
the
students
;
and
my
*NL*
proficiency
,
that
of
the
masters
.
Professor
Krempe
often
asked
me
,
with
*NL*
a
sly
smile
,
how
Cornelius
Agrippa
went
on
?
whilst
M.
Waldman
expressed
*NL*
the
most
heart-felt
exultation
in
my
progress
.
Two
years
passed
in
this
*NL*
manner
,
during
which
I
paid
no
visit
to
Geneva
,
but
was
engaged
,
heart
*NL*
and
soul
,
in
the
pursuit
of
some
discoveries
,
which
I
hoped
to
make
.
*NL*
None
but
those
who
have
experienced
them
can
conceive
of
the
enticements
*NL*
of
science
.
In
other
studies
you
go
as
far
as
others
have
gone
before
*NL*
you
,
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
know
;
but
in
a
scientific
pursuit
*NL*
there
is
continual
food
for
discovery
and
wonder
.
A
mind
of
moderate
*NL*
capacity
,
which
closely
pursues
one
study
,
must
infallibly
arrive
at
*NL*
great
proficiency
in
that
study
;
and
I
,
who
continually
sought
the
*NL*
attainment
of
one
object
of
pursuit
,
and
was
solely
wrapt
up
in
this
,
*NL*
improved
so
rapidly
,
that
,
at
the
end
of
two
years
,
I
made
some
*NL*
discoveries
in
the
improvement
of
some
chemical
instruments
,
which
*NL*
procured
me
great
esteem
and
admiration
at
the
university
.
When
I
had
*NL*
arrived
at
this
point
,
and
had
become
as
well
acquainted
with
the
theory
*NL*
and
practice
of
natural
philosophy
as
depended
on
the
lessons
of
any
of
*NL*
the
professors
at
Ingolstadt
,
my
residence
there
being
no
longer
*NL*
conducive
to
my
improvements
,
I
thought
of
returning
to
my
friends
and
*NL*
my
native
town
,
when
an
incident
happened
that
protracted
my
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
phaenonema
which
had
peculiarly
attracted
my
attention
was
the
*NL*
structure
of
the
human
frame
,
and
,
indeed
,
any
animal
endued
with
life
.
*NL*
Whence
,
I
often
asked
myself
,
did
the
principle
of
life
proceed
?
It
was
*NL*
a
bold
question
,
and
one
which
has
ever
been
considered
as
a
mystery
;
*NL*
yet
with
how
many
things
are
we
upon
the
brink
of
becoming
acquainted
,
*NL*
if
cowardice
or
carelessness
did
not
restrain
our
inquiries
.
I
revolved
*NL*
these
circumstances
in
my
mind
,
and
determined
thenceforth
to
apply
*NL*
myself
more
particularly
to
those
branches
of
natural
philosophy
which
*NL*
relate
to
physiology
.
Unless
I
had
been
animated
by
an
almost
*NL*
supernatural
enthusiasm
,
my
application
to
this
study
would
have
been
*NL*
irksome
,
and
almost
intolerable
.
To
examine
the
causes
of
life
,
we
must
*NL*
first
have
recourse
to
death
.
I
became
acquainted
with
the
science
of
*NL*
anatomy
:
but
this
was
not
sufficient
;
I
must
also
observe
the
natural
*NL*
decay
and
corruption
of
the
human
body
.
In
my
education
my
father
had
*NL*
taken
the
greatest
precautions
that
my
mind
should
be
impressed
with
no
*NL*
supernatural
horrors
.
I
do
not
ever
remember
to
have
trembled
at
a
tale
*NL*
of
superstition
,
or
to
have
feared
the
apparition
of
a
spirit
.
Darkness
*NL*
had
no
effect
upon
my
fancy
;
and
a
church-yard
was
to
me
merely
the
*NL*
receptacle
of
bodies
deprived
of
life
,
which
,
from
being
the
seat
of
*NL*
beauty
and
strength
,
had
become
food
for
the
worm
.
Now
I
was
led
to
*NL*
examine
the
cause
and
progress
of
this
decay
,
and
forced
to
spend
days
*NL*
and
nights
in
vaults
and
charnel
houses
.
My
attention
was
fixed
upon
*NL*
every
object
the
most
insupportable
to
the
delicacy
of
the
human
*NL*
feelings
.
I
saw
how
the
fine
form
of
man
was
degraded
and
wasted
;
I
*NL*
beheld
the
corruption
of
death
succeed
to
the
blooming
cheek
of
life
;
I
*NL*
saw
how
the
worm
inherited
the
wonders
of
the
eye
and
brain
.
I
paused
,
*NL*
examining
and
analysing
all
the
minutiae
of
causation
,
as
exemplified
in
*NL*
the
change
from
life
to
death
,
and
death
to
life
,
until
from
the
midst
*NL*
of
this
darkness
a
sudden
light
broke
in
upon
me
--
a
light
so
brilliant
*NL*
and
wondrous
,
yet
so
simple
,
that
while
I
became
dizzy
with
the
*NL*
immensity
of
the
prospect
which
it
illustrated
,
I
was
surprised
that
*NL*
among
so
many
men
of
genius
,
who
had
directed
their
inquiries
towards
*NL*
the
same
science
,
that
I
alone
should
be
reserved
to
discover
so
*NL*
astonishing
a
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Remember
,
I
am
not
recording
the
vision
of
a
madman
.
The
sun
does
not
*NL*
more
certainly
shine
in
the
heavens
,
than
that
which
I
now
affirm
is
*NL*
true
.
Some
miracle
might
have
produced
it
,
yet
the
stages
of
the
*NL*
discovery
were
distinct
and
probable
.
After
days
and
nights
of
*NL*
incredible
labour
and
fatigue
,
I
succeeded
in
discovering
the
cause
of
*NL*
generation
and
life
;
nay
,
more
,
I
became
myself
capable
of
bestowing
*NL*
animation
upon
lifeless
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
astonishment
which
I
had
at
first
experienced
on
this
discovery
soon
*NL*
gave
place
to
delight
and
rapture
.
After
so
much
time
spent
in
painful
*NL*
labour
,
to
arrive
at
once
at
the
summit
of
my
desires
,
was
the
most
*NL*
gratifying
consummation
of
my
toils
.
But
this
discovery
was
so
great
*NL*
and
overwhelming
,
that
all
the
steps
by
which
I
had
been
progressively
*NL*
led
to
it
were
obliterated
,
and
I
beheld
only
the
result
.
What
had
been
*NL*
the
study
and
desire
of
the
wisest
men
since
the
creation
of
the
world
,
*NL*
was
now
within
my
grasp
.
Not
that
,
like
a
magic
scene
,
it
all
opened
*NL*
upon
me
at
once
:
the
information
I
had
obtained
was
of
a
nature
rather
*NL*
to
direct
my
endeavours
so
soon
as
I
should
point
them
towards
the
*NL*
object
of
my
search
,
than
to
exhibit
that
object
already
accomplished
.
I
*NL*
was
like
the
Arabian
who
had
been
buried
with
the
dead
,
and
found
a
*NL*
passage
to
life
aided
only
by
one
glimmering
,
and
seemingly
ineffectual
*NL*
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
by
your
eagerness
,
and
the
wonder
and
hope
which
your
eyes
*NL*
express
,
my
friend
,
that
you
expect
to
be
informed
of
the
secret
with
*NL*
which
I
am
acquainted
;
that
can
not
be
:
listen
patiently
until
the
end
of
*NL*
my
story
,
and
you
will
easily
perceive
why
I
am
reserved
upon
that
*NL*
subject
.
I
will
not
lead
you
on
,
unguarded
and
ardent
as
I
then
was
,
to
*NL*
your
destruction
and
infallible
misery
.
Learn
from
me
,
if
not
by
my
*NL*
precepts
,
at
least
by
my
example
,
how
dangerous
is
the
acquirement
of
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
how
much
happier
that
man
is
who
believes
his
native
town
*NL*
to
be
the
world
,
than
he
who
aspires
to
become
greater
than
his
nature
*NL*
will
allow
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
found
so
astonishing
a
power
placed
within
my
hands
,
I
hesitated
*NL*
a
long
time
concerning
the
manner
in
which
I
should
employ
it
.
Although
*NL*
I
possessed
the
capacity
of
bestowing
animation
,
yet
to
prepare
a
frame
*NL*
for
the
reception
of
it
,
with
all
its
intricacies
of
fibres
,
muscles
,
*NL*
and
veins
,
still
remained
a
work
of
inconceivable
difficulty
and
labour
.
*NL*
I
doubted
at
first
whether
I
should
attempt
the
creation
of
a
being
like
*NL*
myself
or
one
of
simpler
organization
;
but
my
imagination
was
too
much
*NL*
exalted
by
my
first
success
to
permit
me
to
doubt
of
my
ability
to
give
*NL*
life
to
an
animal
as
complex
and
wonderful
as
man
.
The
materials
at
*NL*
present
within
my
command
hardly
appeared
adequate
to
so
arduous
an
*NL*
undertaking
;
but
I
doubted
not
that
I
should
ultimately
succeed
.
I
*NL*
prepared
myself
for
a
multitude
of
reverses
;
my
operations
might
be
*NL*
incessantly
baffled
,
and
at
last
my
work
be
imperfect
:
yet
,
when
I
*NL*
considered
the
improvement
which
every
day
takes
place
in
science
and
*NL*
mechanics
,
I
was
encouraged
to
hope
my
present
attempts
would
at
least
*NL*
lay
the
foundations
of
future
success
.
Nor
could
I
consider
the
*NL*
magnitude
and
complexity
of
my
plan
as
any
argument
of
its
*NL*
impracticability
.
It
was
with
these
feelings
that
I
began
the
creation
*NL*
of
a
human
being
.
As
the
minuteness
of
the
parts
formed
a
great
*NL*
hindrance
to
my
speed
,
I
resolved
,
contrary
to
my
first
intention
,
to
*NL*
make
the
being
of
a
gigantic
stature
;
that
is
to
say
,
about
eight
feet
*NL*
in
height
,
and
proportionably
large
.
After
having
formed
this
*NL*
determination
,
and
having
spent
some
months
in
successfully
collecting
*NL*
and
arranging
my
materials
,
I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
can
conceive
the
variety
of
feelings
which
bore
me
onwards
,
like
*NL*
a
hurricane
,
in
the
first
enthusiasm
of
success
.
Life
and
death
appeared
*NL*
to
me
ideal
bounds
,
which
I
should
first
break
through
,
and
pour
a
*NL*
torrent
of
light
into
our
dark
world
.
A
new
species
would
bless
me
as
*NL*
its
creator
and
source
;
many
happy
and
excellent
natures
would
owe
their
*NL*
being
to
me
.
No
father
could
claim
the
gratitude
of
his
child
so
*NL*
completely
as
I
should
deserve
their
's
.
Pursuing
these
reflections
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
that
if
I
could
bestow
animation
upon
lifeless
matter
,
I
might
*NL*
in
process
of
time
-LRB-
although
I
now
found
it
impossible
-RRB-
renew
life
where
*NL*
death
had
apparently
devoted
the
body
to
corruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
supported
my
spirits
,
while
I
pursued
my
undertaking
with
*NL*
unremitting
ardour
.
My
cheek
had
grown
pale
with
study
,
and
my
person
*NL*
had
become
emaciated
with
confinement
.
Sometimes
,
on
the
very
brink
of
*NL*
certainty
,
I
failed
;
yet
still
I
clung
to
the
hope
which
the
next
day
or
*NL*
the
next
hour
might
realize
.
One
secret
which
I
alone
possessed
was
the
*NL*
hope
to
which
I
had
dedicated
myself
;
and
the
moon
gazed
on
my
midnight
*NL*
labours
,
while
,
with
unrelaxed
and
breathless
eagerness
,
I
pursued
*NL*
nature
to
her
hiding
places
.
Who
shall
conceive
the
horrors
of
my
secret
*NL*
toil
,
as
I
dabbled
among
the
unhallowed
damps
of
the
grave
,
or
tortured
*NL*
the
living
animal
to
animate
the
lifeless
clay
?
My
limbs
now
tremble
,
*NL*
and
my
eyes
swim
with
the
remembrance
;
but
then
a
resistless
,
and
almost
*NL*
frantic
impulse
,
urged
me
forward
;
I
seemed
to
have
lost
all
soul
or
*NL*
sensation
but
for
this
one
pursuit
.
It
was
indeed
but
a
passing
trance
,
*NL*
that
only
made
me
feel
with
renewed
acuteness
so
soon
as
,
the
unnatural
*NL*
stimulus
ceasing
to
operate
,
I
had
returned
to
my
old
habits
.
I
*NL*
collected
bones
from
charnel
houses
;
and
disturbed
,
with
profane
*NL*
fingers
,
the
tremendous
secrets
of
the
human
frame
.
In
a
solitary
*NL*
chamber
,
or
rather
cell
,
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
and
separated
from
all
*NL*
the
other
apartments
by
a
gallery
and
staircase
,
I
kept
my
workshop
of
*NL*
filthy
creation
;
my
eyeballs
were
starting
from
their
sockets
in
*NL*
attending
to
the
details
of
my
employment
.
The
dissecting
room
and
the
*NL*
slaughter-house
furnished
many
of
my
materials
;
and
often
did
my
human
*NL*
nature
turn
with
loathing
from
my
occupation
,
whilst
,
still
urged
on
by
*NL*
an
eagerness
which
perpetually
increased
,
I
brought
my
work
near
to
a
*NL*
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
months
passed
while
I
was
thus
engaged
,
heart
and
soul
,
in
*NL*
one
pursuit
.
It
was
a
most
beautiful
season
;
never
did
the
fields
bestow
*NL*
a
more
plentiful
harvest
,
or
the
vines
yield
a
more
luxuriant
vintage
:
*NL*
but
my
eyes
were
insensible
to
the
charms
of
nature
.
And
the
same
*NL*
feelings
which
made
me
neglect
the
scenes
around
me
caused
me
also
to
*NL*
forget
those
friends
who
were
so
many
miles
absent
,
and
whom
I
had
not
*NL*
seen
for
so
long
a
time
.
I
knew
my
silence
disquieted
them
;
and
I
well
*NL*
remembered
the
words
of
my
father
:
``
I
know
that
while
you
are
pleased
*NL*
with
yourself
,
you
will
think
of
us
with
affection
,
and
we
shall
hear
*NL*
regularly
from
you
.
You
must
pardon
me
,
if
I
regard
any
interruption
in
*NL*
your
correspondence
as
a
proof
that
your
other
duties
are
equally
*NL*
neglected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
well
therefore
what
would
be
my
father
's
feelings
;
but
I
could
*NL*
not
tear
my
thoughts
from
my
employment
,
loathsome
in
itself
,
but
which
*NL*
had
taken
an
irresistible
hold
of
my
imagination
.
I
wished
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
to
procrastinate
all
that
related
to
my
feelings
of
affection
until
the
*NL*
great
object
,
which
swallowed
up
every
habit
of
my
nature
,
should
be
*NL*
completed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
thought
that
my
father
would
be
unjust
if
he
ascribed
my
neglect
*NL*
to
vice
,
or
faultiness
on
my
part
;
but
I
am
now
convinced
that
he
was
*NL*
justified
in
conceiving
that
I
should
not
be
altogether
free
from
blame
.
*NL*
A
human
being
in
perfection
ought
always
to
preserve
a
calm
and
peaceful
*NL*
mind
,
and
never
to
allow
passion
or
a
transitory
desire
to
disturb
his
*NL*
tranquillity
.
I
do
not
think
that
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
is
an
*NL*
exception
to
this
rule
.
If
the
study
to
which
you
apply
yourself
has
a
*NL*
tendency
to
weaken
your
affections
,
and
to
destroy
your
taste
for
those
*NL*
simple
pleasures
in
which
no
alloy
can
possibly
mix
,
then
that
study
is
*NL*
certainly
unlawful
,
that
is
to
say
,
not
befitting
the
human
mind
.
If
*NL*
this
rule
were
always
observed
;
if
no
man
allowed
any
pursuit
*NL*
whatsoever
to
interfere
with
the
tranquillity
of
his
domestic
*NL*
affections
,
Greece
had
not
been
enslaved
;
Caesar
would
have
spared
his
*NL*
country
;
America
would
have
been
discovered
more
gradually
;
and
the
*NL*
empires
of
Mexico
and
Peru
had
not
been
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
forget
that
I
am
moralizing
in
the
most
interesting
part
of
my
*NL*
tale
;
and
your
looks
remind
me
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
made
no
reproach
in
his
letters
;
and
only
took
notice
of
my
*NL*
silence
by
inquiring
into
my
occupations
more
particularly
than
before
.
*NL*
Winter
,
spring
,
and
summer
,
passed
away
during
my
labours
;
but
I
did
not
*NL*
watch
the
blossom
or
the
expanding
leaves
--
sights
which
before
always
*NL*
yielded
me
supreme
delight
,
so
deeply
was
I
engrossed
in
my
occupation
.
*NL*
The
leaves
of
that
year
had
withered
before
my
work
drew
near
to
a
*NL*
close
;
and
now
every
day
shewed
me
more
plainly
how
well
I
had
*NL*
succeeded
.
But
my
enthusiasm
was
checked
by
my
anxiety
,
and
I
appeared
*NL*
rather
like
one
doomed
by
slavery
to
toil
in
the
mines
,
or
any
other
*NL*
unwholesome
trade
,
than
an
artist
occupied
by
his
favourite
employment
.
*NL*
Every
night
I
was
oppressed
by
a
slow
fever
,
and
I
became
nervous
to
a
*NL*
most
painful
degree
;
a
disease
that
I
regretted
the
more
because
I
had
*NL*
hitherto
enjoyed
most
excellent
health
,
and
had
always
boasted
of
the
*NL*
firmness
of
my
nerves
.
But
I
believed
that
exercise
and
amusement
would
*NL*
soon
drive
away
such
symptoms
;
and
I
promised
myself
both
of
these
,
when
*NL*
my
creation
should
be
complete
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
a
dreary
night
of
November
,
that
I
beheld
the
accomplishment
*NL*
of
my
toils
.
With
an
anxiety
that
almost
amounted
to
agony
,
I
collected
*NL*
the
instruments
of
life
around
me
,
that
I
might
infuse
a
spark
of
being
*NL*
into
the
lifeless
thing
that
lay
at
my
feet
.
It
was
already
one
in
the
*NL*
morning
;
the
rain
pattered
dismally
against
the
panes
,
and
my
candle
was
*NL*
nearly
burnt
out
,
when
,
by
the
glimmer
of
the
half-extinguished
light
,
I
*NL*
saw
the
dull
yellow
eye
of
the
creature
open
;
it
breathed
hard
,
and
a
*NL*
convulsive
motion
agitated
its
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
can
I
describe
my
emotions
at
this
catastrophe
,
or
how
delineate
the
*NL*
wretch
whom
with
such
infinite
pains
and
care
I
had
endeavoured
to
form
?
*NL*
His
limbs
were
in
proportion
,
and
I
had
selected
his
features
as
*NL*
beautiful
.
Beautiful
!
--
Great
God
!
His
yellow
skin
scarcely
covered
the
*NL*
work
of
muscles
and
arteries
beneath
;
his
hair
was
of
a
lustrous
black
,
*NL*
and
flowing
;
his
teeth
of
a
pearly
whiteness
;
but
these
luxuriances
only
*NL*
formed
a
more
horrid
contrast
with
his
watery
eyes
,
that
seemed
almost
*NL*
of
the
same
colour
as
the
dun
white
sockets
in
which
they
were
set
,
his
*NL*
shrivelled
complexion
,
and
straight
black
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
different
accidents
of
life
are
not
so
changeable
as
the
feelings
of
*NL*
human
nature
.
I
had
worked
hard
for
nearly
two
years
,
for
the
sole
*NL*
purpose
of
infusing
life
into
an
inanimate
body
.
For
this
I
had
deprived
*NL*
myself
of
rest
and
health
.
I
had
desired
it
with
an
ardour
that
far
*NL*
exceeded
moderation
;
but
now
that
I
had
finished
,
the
beauty
of
the
*NL*
dream
vanished
,
and
breathless
horror
and
disgust
filled
my
heart
.
*NL*
Unable
to
endure
the
aspect
of
the
being
I
had
created
,
I
rushed
out
of
*NL*
the
room
,
and
continued
a
long
time
traversing
my
bed-chamber
,
unable
*NL*
to
compose
my
mind
to
sleep
.
At
length
lassitude
succeeded
to
the
*NL*
tumult
I
had
before
endured
;
and
I
threw
myself
on
the
bed
in
my
*NL*
clothes
,
endeavouring
to
seek
a
few
moments
of
forgetfulness
.
But
it
was
*NL*
in
vain
:
I
slept
indeed
,
but
I
was
disturbed
by
the
wildest
dreams
.
I
*NL*
thought
I
saw
Elizabeth
,
in
the
bloom
of
health
,
walking
in
the
streets
*NL*
of
Ingolstadt
.
Delighted
and
surprised
,
I
embraced
her
;
but
as
I
*NL*
imprinted
the
first
kiss
on
her
lips
,
they
became
livid
with
the
hue
of
*NL*
death
;
her
features
appeared
to
change
,
and
I
thought
that
I
held
the
*NL*
corpse
of
my
dead
mother
in
my
arms
;
a
shroud
enveloped
her
form
,
and
I
*NL*
saw
the
grave-worms
crawling
in
the
folds
of
the
flannel
.
I
started
from
*NL*
my
sleep
with
horror
;
a
cold
dew
covered
my
forehead
,
my
teeth
*NL*
chattered
,
and
every
limb
became
convulsed
;
when
,
by
the
dim
and
yellow
*NL*
light
of
the
moon
,
as
it
forced
its
way
through
the
window-shutters
,
I
*NL*
beheld
the
wretch
--
the
miserable
monster
whom
I
had
created
.
He
held
up
*NL*
the
curtain
of
the
bed
;
and
his
eyes
,
if
eyes
they
may
be
called
,
were
*NL*
fixed
on
me
.
His
jaws
opened
,
and
he
muttered
some
inarticulate
sounds
,
*NL*
while
a
grin
wrinkled
his
cheeks
.
He
might
have
spoken
,
but
I
did
not
*NL*
hear
;
one
hand
was
stretched
out
,
seemingly
to
detain
me
,
but
I
escaped
,
*NL*
and
rushed
down
stairs
.
I
took
refuge
in
the
court-yard
belonging
to
the
*NL*
house
which
I
inhabited
;
where
I
remained
during
the
rest
of
the
night
,
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
in
the
greatest
agitation
,
listening
attentively
,
*NL*
catching
and
fearing
each
sound
as
if
it
were
to
announce
the
approach
*NL*
of
the
demoniacal
corpse
to
which
I
had
so
miserably
given
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
no
mortal
could
support
the
horror
of
that
countenance
.
A
mummy
*NL*
again
endued
with
animation
could
not
be
so
hideous
as
that
wretch
.
I
*NL*
had
gazed
on
him
while
unfinished
;
he
was
ugly
then
;
but
when
those
*NL*
muscles
and
joints
were
rendered
capable
of
motion
,
it
became
a
thing
*NL*
such
as
even
Dante
could
not
have
conceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
the
night
wretchedly
.
Sometimes
my
pulse
beat
so
quickly
and
*NL*
hardly
,
that
I
felt
the
palpitation
of
every
artery
;
at
others
,
I
nearly
*NL*
sank
to
the
ground
through
languor
and
extreme
weakness
.
Mingled
with
*NL*
this
horror
,
I
felt
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
:
dreams
that
had
*NL*
been
my
food
and
pleasant
rest
for
so
long
a
space
,
were
now
become
a
*NL*
hell
to
me
;
and
the
change
was
so
rapid
,
the
overthrow
so
complete
!
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
,
dismal
and
wet
,
at
length
dawned
,
and
discovered
to
my
*NL*
sleepless
and
aching
eyes
the
church
of
Ingolstadt
,
its
white
steeple
*NL*
and
clock
,
which
indicated
the
sixth
hour
.
The
porter
opened
the
gates
*NL*
of
the
court
,
which
had
that
night
been
my
asylum
,
and
I
issued
into
the
*NL*
streets
,
pacing
them
with
quick
steps
,
as
if
I
sought
to
avoid
the
*NL*
wretch
whom
I
feared
every
turning
of
the
street
would
present
to
my
*NL*
view
.
I
did
not
dare
return
to
the
apartment
which
I
inhabited
,
but
felt
*NL*
impelled
to
hurry
on
,
although
wetted
by
the
rain
,
which
poured
from
a
*NL*
black
and
comfortless
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
continued
walking
in
this
manner
for
some
time
,
endeavouring
,
by
*NL*
bodily
exercise
,
to
ease
the
load
that
weighed
upon
my
mind
.
I
*NL*
traversed
the
streets
,
without
any
clear
conception
of
where
I
was
,
or
*NL*
what
I
was
doing
.
My
heart
palpitated
in
the
sickness
of
fear
;
and
I
*NL*
hurried
on
with
irregular
steps
,
not
daring
to
look
about
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
Like
one
who
,
on
a
lonely
road
,
*NL*
Doth
walk
in
fear
and
dread
,
*NL*
And
,
having
once
turn
'd
round
,
walks
on
,
*NL*
And
turns
no
more
his
head
;
*NL*
Because
he
knows
a
frightful
fiend
*NL*
Doth
close
behind
him
tread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Continuing
thus
,
I
came
at
length
opposite
to
the
inn
at
which
the
*NL*
various
diligences
and
carriages
usually
stopped
.
Here
I
paused
,
I
knew
*NL*
not
why
;
but
I
remained
some
minutes
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
a
coach
that
*NL*
was
coming
towards
me
from
the
other
end
of
the
street
.
As
it
drew
*NL*
nearer
,
I
observed
that
it
was
the
Swiss
diligence
:
it
stopped
just
*NL*
where
I
was
standing
;
and
,
on
the
door
being
opened
,
I
perceived
Henry
*NL*
Clerval
,
who
,
on
seeing
me
,
instantly
sprung
out
.
``
My
dear
*NL*
Frankenstein
,
''
exclaimed
he
,
``
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
how
fortunate
*NL*
that
you
should
be
here
at
the
very
moment
of
my
alighting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
equal
my
delight
on
seeing
Clerval
;
his
presence
brought
*NL*
back
to
my
thoughts
my
father
,
Elizabeth
,
and
all
those
scenes
of
home
*NL*
so
dear
to
my
recollection
.
I
grasped
his
hand
,
and
in
a
moment
forgot
*NL*
my
horror
and
misfortune
;
I
felt
suddenly
,
and
for
the
first
time
during
*NL*
many
months
,
calm
and
serene
joy
.
I
welcomed
my
friend
,
therefore
,
in
*NL*
the
most
cordial
manner
,
and
we
walked
towards
my
college
.
Clerval
*NL*
continued
talking
for
some
time
about
our
mutual
friends
,
and
his
own
*NL*
good
fortune
in
being
permitted
to
come
to
Ingolstadt
.
``
You
may
easily
*NL*
believe
,
''
said
he
,
``
how
great
was
the
difficulty
to
persuade
my
father
*NL*
that
it
was
not
absolutely
necessary
for
a
merchant
not
to
understand
*NL*
any
thing
except
book-keeping
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
believe
I
left
him
*NL*
incredulous
to
the
last
,
for
his
constant
answer
to
my
unwearied
*NL*
entreaties
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
Dutch
schoolmaster
in
the
Vicar
*NL*
of
Wakefield
:
'
I
have
ten
thousand
florins
a
year
without
Greek
,
I
eat
*NL*
heartily
without
Greek
.
'
But
his
affection
for
me
at
length
overcame
his
*NL*
dislike
of
learning
,
and
he
has
permitted
me
to
undertake
a
voyage
of
*NL*
discovery
to
the
land
of
knowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gives
me
the
greatest
delight
to
see
you
;
but
tell
me
how
you
left
*NL*
my
father
,
brothers
,
and
Elizabeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
and
very
happy
,
only
a
little
uneasy
that
they
hear
from
you
*NL*
so
seldom
.
By
the
bye
,
I
mean
to
lecture
you
a
little
upon
their
account
*NL*
myself
.
--
But
,
my
dear
Frankenstein
,
''
continued
he
,
stopping
short
,
and
*NL*
gazing
full
in
my
face
,
``
I
did
not
before
remark
how
very
ill
you
*NL*
appear
;
so
thin
and
pale
;
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
watching
for
*NL*
several
nights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
guessed
right
;
I
have
lately
been
so
deeply
engaged
in
one
*NL*
occupation
,
that
I
have
not
allowed
myself
sufficient
rest
,
as
you
see
:
*NL*
but
I
hope
,
I
sincerely
hope
,
that
all
these
employments
are
now
at
an
*NL*
end
,
and
that
I
am
at
length
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
excessively
;
I
could
not
endure
to
think
of
,
and
far
less
to
*NL*
allude
to
the
occurrences
of
the
preceding
night
.
I
walked
with
a
quick
*NL*
pace
,
and
we
soon
arrived
at
my
college
.
I
then
reflected
,
and
the
*NL*
thought
made
me
shiver
,
that
the
creature
whom
I
had
left
in
my
*NL*
apartment
might
still
be
there
,
alive
,
and
walking
about
.
I
dreaded
to
*NL*
behold
this
monster
;
but
I
feared
still
more
that
Henry
should
see
him
.
*NL*
Entreating
him
therefore
to
remain
a
few
minutes
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
stairs
,
I
darted
up
towards
my
own
room
.
My
hand
was
already
on
the
lock
*NL*
of
the
door
before
I
recollected
myself
.
I
then
paused
;
and
a
cold
*NL*
shivering
came
over
me
.
I
threw
the
door
forcibly
open
,
as
children
are
*NL*
accustomed
to
do
when
they
expect
a
spectre
to
stand
in
waiting
for
them
*NL*
on
the
other
side
;
but
nothing
appeared
.
I
stepped
fearfully
in
:
the
*NL*
apartment
was
empty
;
and
my
bedroom
was
also
freed
from
its
hideous
*NL*
guest
.
I
could
hardly
believe
that
so
great
a
good-fortune
could
have
*NL*
befallen
me
;
but
when
I
became
assured
that
my
enemy
had
indeed
fled
,
I
*NL*
clapped
my
hands
for
joy
,
and
ran
down
to
Clerval
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
ascended
into
my
room
,
and
the
servant
presently
brought
breakfast
;
*NL*
but
I
was
unable
to
contain
myself
.
It
was
not
joy
only
that
possessed
*NL*
me
;
I
felt
my
flesh
tingle
with
excess
of
sensitiveness
,
and
my
pulse
*NL*
beat
rapidly
.
I
was
unable
to
remain
for
a
single
instant
in
the
same
*NL*
place
;
I
jumped
over
the
chairs
,
clapped
my
hands
,
and
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
Clerval
at
first
attributed
my
unusual
spirits
to
joy
on
his
arrival
;
*NL*
but
when
he
observed
me
more
attentively
,
he
saw
a
wildness
in
my
eyes
*NL*
for
which
he
could
not
account
;
and
my
loud
,
unrestrained
,
heartless
*NL*
laughter
,
frightened
and
astonished
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Victor
,
''
cried
he
,
``
what
,
for
God
's
sake
,
is
the
matter
?
Do
not
*NL*
laugh
in
that
manner
.
How
ill
you
are
!
What
is
the
cause
of
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
ask
me
,
''
cried
I
,
putting
my
hands
before
my
eyes
,
for
I
thought
*NL*
I
saw
the
dreaded
spectre
glide
into
the
room
;
''
_
he
_
can
tell
.
--
Oh
,
save
*NL*
me
!
save
me
!
''
I
imagined
that
the
monster
seized
me
;
I
struggled
*NL*
furiously
,
and
fell
down
in
a
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Clerval
!
what
must
have
been
his
feelings
?
A
meeting
,
which
he
*NL*
anticipated
with
such
joy
,
so
strangely
turned
to
bitterness
.
But
I
was
*NL*
not
the
witness
of
his
grief
;
for
I
was
lifeless
,
and
did
not
recover
my
*NL*
senses
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
commencement
of
a
nervous
fever
,
which
confined
me
for
*NL*
several
months
.
During
all
that
time
Henry
was
my
only
nurse
.
I
*NL*
afterwards
learned
that
,
knowing
my
father
's
advanced
age
,
and
unfitness
*NL*
for
so
long
a
journey
,
and
how
wretched
my
sickness
would
make
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
he
spared
them
this
grief
by
concealing
the
extent
of
my
*NL*
disorder
.
He
knew
that
I
could
not
have
a
more
kind
and
attentive
nurse
*NL*
than
himself
;
and
,
firm
in
the
hope
he
felt
of
my
recovery
,
he
did
not
*NL*
doubt
that
,
instead
of
doing
harm
,
he
performed
the
kindest
action
that
*NL*
he
could
towards
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
in
reality
very
ill
;
and
surely
nothing
but
the
unbounded
and
*NL*
unremitting
attentions
of
my
friend
could
have
restored
me
to
life
.
The
*NL*
form
of
the
monster
on
whom
I
had
bestowed
existence
was
for
ever
before
*NL*
my
eyes
,
and
I
raved
incessantly
concerning
him
.
Doubtless
my
words
*NL*
surprised
Henry
:
he
at
first
believed
them
to
be
the
wanderings
of
my
*NL*
disturbed
imagination
;
but
the
pertinacity
with
which
I
continually
*NL*
recurred
to
the
same
subject
persuaded
him
that
my
disorder
indeed
owed
*NL*
its
origin
to
some
uncommon
and
terrible
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
very
slow
degrees
,
and
with
frequent
relapses
,
that
alarmed
and
*NL*
grieved
my
friend
,
I
recovered
.
I
remember
the
first
time
I
became
*NL*
capable
of
observing
outward
objects
with
any
kind
of
pleasure
,
I
*NL*
perceived
that
the
fallen
leaves
had
disappeared
,
and
that
the
young
*NL*
buds
were
shooting
forth
from
the
trees
that
shaded
my
window
.
It
was
a
*NL*
divine
spring
;
and
the
season
contributed
greatly
to
my
convalescence
.
I
*NL*
felt
also
sentiments
of
joy
and
affection
revive
in
my
bosom
;
my
gloom
*NL*
disappeared
,
and
in
a
short
time
I
became
as
cheerful
as
before
I
was
*NL*
attacked
by
the
fatal
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
Clerval
,
''
exclaimed
I
,
``
how
kind
,
how
very
good
you
are
to
me
.
*NL*
This
whole
winter
,
instead
of
being
spent
in
study
,
as
you
promised
*NL*
yourself
,
has
been
consumed
in
my
sick
room
.
How
shall
I
ever
repay
*NL*
you
?
I
feel
the
greatest
remorse
for
the
disappointment
of
which
I
have
*NL*
been
the
occasion
;
but
you
will
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
repay
me
entirely
,
if
you
do
not
discompose
yourself
,
but
get
*NL*
well
as
fast
as
you
can
;
and
since
you
appear
in
such
good
spirits
,
I
*NL*
may
speak
to
you
on
one
subject
,
may
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
.
One
subject
!
what
could
it
be
?
Could
he
allude
to
an
object
*NL*
on
whom
I
dared
not
even
think
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Compose
yourself
,
''
said
Clerval
,
who
observed
my
change
of
colour
,
``
I
*NL*
will
not
mention
it
,
if
it
agitates
you
;
but
your
father
and
cousin
*NL*
would
be
very
happy
if
they
received
a
letter
from
you
in
your
own
*NL*
hand-writing
.
They
hardly
know
how
ill
you
have
been
,
and
are
uneasy
at
*NL*
your
long
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
my
dear
Henry
.
How
could
you
suppose
that
my
first
thought
*NL*
would
not
fly
towards
those
dear
,
dear
friends
whom
I
love
,
and
who
are
*NL*
so
deserving
of
my
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
is
your
present
temper
,
my
friend
,
you
will
perhaps
be
glad
to
*NL*
see
a
letter
that
has
been
lying
here
some
days
for
you

it
is
from

put

``
MY
DEAR
COUSIN
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
describe
to
you
the
uneasiness
we
have
all
felt
concerning
*NL*
your
health
.
We
can
not
help
imagining
that
your
friend
Clerval
conceals
*NL*
the
extent
of
your
disorder
:
for
it
is
now
several
months
since
we
have
*NL*
seen
your
hand-writing
;
and
all
this
time
you
have
been
obliged
to
*NL*
dictate
your
letters
to
Henry
.
Surely
,
Victor
,
you
must
have
been
*NL*
exceedingly
ill
;
and
this
makes
us
all
very
wretched
,
as
much
so
nearly
*NL*
as
after
the
death
of
your
dear
mother
.
My
uncle
was
almost
persuaded
*NL*
that
you
were
indeed
dangerously
ill
,
and
could
hardly
be
restrained
*NL*
from
undertaking
a
journey
to
Ingolstadt
.
Clerval
always
writes
that
you
*NL*
are
getting
better
;
I
eagerly
hope
that
you
will
confirm
this
*NL*
intelligence
soon
in
your
own
hand-writing
;
for
indeed
,
indeed
,
Victor
,
*NL*
we
are
all
very
miserable
on
this
account
.
Relieve
us
from
this
fear
,
*NL*
and
we
shall
be
the
happiest
creatures
in
the
world
.
Your
father
's
*NL*
health
is
now
so
vigorous
,
that
he
appears
ten
years
younger
since
last
*NL*
winter
.
Ernest
also
is
so
much
improved
,
that
you
would
hardly
know
him
:
*NL*
he
is
now
nearly
sixteen
,
and
has
lost
that
sickly
appearance
which
he
*NL*
had
some
years
ago
;
he
is
grown
quite
robust
and
active
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
uncle
and
I
conversed
a
long
time
last
night
about
what
profession
*NL*
Ernest
should
follow
.
His
constant
illness
when
young
has
deprived
him
*NL*
of
the
habits
of
application
;
and
now
that
he
enjoys
good
health
,
he
is
*NL*
continually
in
the
open
air
,
climbing
the
hills
,
or
rowing
on
the
lake
.
*NL*
I
therefore
proposed
that
he
should
be
a
farmer
;
which
you
know
,
Cousin
,
*NL*
is
a
favourite
scheme
of
mine
.
A
farmer
's
is
a
very
healthy
happy
life
;
*NL*
and
the
least
hurtful
,
or
rather
the
most
beneficial
profession
of
any
.
*NL*
My
uncle
had
an
idea
of
his
being
educated
as
an
advocate
,
that
through
*NL*
his
interest
he
might
become
a
judge
.
But
,
besides
that
he
is
not
at
all
*NL*
fitted
for
such
an
occupation
,
it
is
certainly
more
creditable
to
*NL*
cultivate
the
earth
for
the
sustenance
of
man
,
than
to
be
the
confidant
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
the
accomplice
,
of
his
vices
;
which
is
the
profession
of
a
*NL*
lawyer
.
I
said
,
that
the
employments
of
a
prosperous
farmer
,
if
they
*NL*
were
not
a
more
honourable
,
they
were
at
least
a
happier
species
of
*NL*
occupation
than
that
of
a
judge
,
whose
misfortune
it
was
always
to
*NL*
meddle
with
the
dark
side
of
human
nature
.
My
uncle
smiled
,
and
said
,
*NL*
that
I
ought
to
be
an
advocate
myself
,
which
put
an
end
to
the
*NL*
conversation
on
that
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
I
must
tell
you
a
little
story
that
will
please
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
amuse
you
.
Do
you
not
remember
Justine
Moritz
?
Probably
you
do
not
;
I
*NL*
will
relate
her
history
,
therefore
,
in
a
few
words
.
Madame
Moritz
,
her
*NL*
mother
,
was
a
widow
with
four
children
,
of
whom
Justine
was
the
third
.
*NL*
This
girl
had
always
been
the
favourite
of
her
father
;
but
,
through
a
*NL*
strange
perversity
,
her
mother
could
not
endure
her
,
and
,
after
the
*NL*
death
of
M.
Moritz
,
treated
her
very
ill
.
My
aunt
observed
this
;
and
,
*NL*
when
Justine
was
twelve
years
of
age
,
prevailed
on
her
mother
to
allow
*NL*
her
to
live
at
her
house
.
The
republican
institutions
of
our
country
*NL*
have
produced
simpler
and
happier
manners
than
those
which
prevail
in
*NL*
the
great
monarchies
that
surround
it
.
Hence
there
is
less
distinction
*NL*
between
the
several
classes
of
its
inhabitants
;
and
the
lower
orders
*NL*
being
neither
so
poor
nor
so
despised
,
their
manners
are
more
refined
*NL*
and
moral
.
A
servant
in
Geneva
does
not
mean
the
same
thing
as
a
servant
*NL*
in
France
and
England
.
Justine
,
thus
received
in
our
family
,
learned
the
*NL*
duties
of
a
servant
;
a
condition
which
,
in
our
fortunate
country
,
does
*NL*
not
include
the
idea
of
ignorance
,
and
a
sacrifice
of
the
dignity
of
a
*NL*
human
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
what
I
have
said
,
I
dare
say
you
well
remember
the
heroine
of
my
*NL*
little
tale
:
for
Justine
was
a
great
favourite
of
your
's
;
and
I
*NL*
recollect
you
once
remarked
,
that
if
you
were
in
an
ill
humour
,
one
*NL*
glance
from
Justine
could
dissipate
it
,
for
the
same
reason
that
Ariosto
*NL*
gives
concerning
the
beauty
of
Angelica
--
she
looked
so
frank-hearted
and
*NL*
happy
.
My
aunt
conceived
a
great
attachment
for
her
,
by
which
she
was
*NL*
induced
to
give
her
an
education
superior
to
that
which
she
had
at
*NL*
first
intended
.
This
benefit
was
fully
repaid
;
Justine
was
the
most
*NL*
grateful
little
creature
in
the
world
:
I
do
not
mean
that
she
made
any
*NL*
professions
,
I
never
heard
one
pass
her
lips
;
but
you
could
see
by
her
*NL*
eyes
that
she
almost
adored
her
protectress
.
Although
her
disposition
*NL*
was
gay
,
and
in
many
respects
inconsiderate
,
yet
she
paid
the
greatest
*NL*
attention
to
every
gesture
of
my
aunt
.
She
thought
her
the
model
of
all
*NL*
excellence
,
and
endeavoured
to
imitate
her
phraseology
and
manners
,
so
*NL*
that
even
now
she
often
reminds
me
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
dearest
aunt
died
,
every
one
was
too
much
occupied
in
their
own
*NL*
grief
to
notice
poor
Justine
,
who
had
attended
her
during
her
illness
*NL*
with
the
most
anxious
affection
.
Poor
Justine
was
very
ill
;
but
other
*NL*
trials
were
reserved
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
by
one
,
her
brothers
and
sister
died
;
and
her
mother
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
her
neglected
daughter
,
was
left
childless
.
The
conscience
*NL*
of
the
woman
was
troubled
;
she
began
to
think
that
the
deaths
of
her
*NL*
favourites
was
a
judgment
from
heaven
to
chastise
her
partiality
.
She
*NL*
was
a
Roman
Catholic
;
and
I
believe
her
confessor
confirmed
the
idea
*NL*
which
she
had
conceived
.
Accordingly
,
a
few
months
after
your
departure
*NL*
for
Ingolstadt
,
Justine
was
called
home
by
her
repentant
mother
.
Poor
*NL*
girl
!
she
wept
when
she
quitted
our
house
:
she
was
much
altered
since
*NL*
the
death
of
my
aunt
;
grief
had
given
softness
and
a
winning
mildness
to
*NL*
her
manners
,
which
had
before
been
remarkable
for
vivacity
.
Nor
was
her
*NL*
residence
at
her
mother
's
house
of
a
nature
to
restore
her
gaiety
.
The
*NL*
poor
woman
was
very
vacillating
in
her
repentance
.
She
sometimes
begged
*NL*
Justine
to
forgive
her
unkindness
,
but
much
oftener
accused
her
of
*NL*
having
caused
the
deaths
of
her
brothers
and
sister
.
Perpetual
fretting
*NL*
at
length
threw
Madame
Moritz
into
a
decline
,
which
at
first
increased
*NL*
her
irritability
,
but
she
is
now
at
peace
for
ever
.
She
died
on
the
*NL*
first
approach
of
cold
weather
,
at
the
beginning
of
this
last
winter
.
*NL*
Justine
has
returned
to
us
;
and
I
assure
you
I
love
her
tenderly
.
She
is
*NL*
very
clever
and
gentle
,
and
extremely
pretty
;
as
I
mentioned
before
,
her
*NL*
mien
and
her
expressions
continually
remind
me
of
my
dear
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
also
a
few
words
to
you
,
my
dear
cousin
,
of
little
darling
*NL*
William
.
I
wish
you
could
see
him
;
he
is
very
tall
of
his
age
,
with
*NL*
sweet
laughing
blue
eyes
,
dark
eye-lashes
,
and
curling
hair
.
When
he
*NL*
smiles
,
two
little
dimples
appear
on
each
cheek
,
which
are
rosy
with
*NL*
health
.
He
has
already
had
one
or
two
little
_
wives
_
,
but
Louisa
Biron
*NL*
is
his
favourite
,
a
pretty
little
girl
of
five
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
dear
Victor
,
I
dare
say
you
wish
to
be
indulged
in
a
little
gossip
*NL*
concerning
the
good
people
of
Geneva
.
The
pretty
Miss
Mansfield
has
*NL*
already
received
the
congratulatory
visits
on
her
approaching
marriage
*NL*
with
a
young
Englishman
,
John
Melbourne
,
Esq.
.
Her
ugly
sister
,
Manon
,
*NL*
married
M.
Duvillard
,
the
rich
banker
,
last
autumn
.
Your
favourite
*NL*
schoolfellow
,
Louis
Manoir
,
has
suffered
several
misfortunes
since
the
*NL*
departure
of
Clerval
from
Geneva
.
But
he
has
already
recovered
his
*NL*
spirits
,
and
is
reported
to
be
on
the
point
of
marrying
a
very
lively
*NL*
pretty
Frenchwoman
,
Madame
Tavernier
.
She
is
a
widow
,
and
much
older
*NL*
than
Manoir
;
but
she
is
very
much
admired
,
and
a
favourite
with
every
*NL*
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
written
myself
into
good
spirits
,
dear
cousin
;
yet
I
can
not
*NL*
conclude
without
again
anxiously
inquiring
concerning
your
health
.
Dear
*NL*
Victor
,
if
you
are
not
very
ill
,
write
yourself
,
and
make
your
father
*NL*
and
all
of
us
happy
;
or
--
I
can
not
bear
to
think
of
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
question
;
my
tears
already
flow
.
Adieu
,
my
dearest
cousin

``
Dear
,
dear
Elizabeth
!
''
I
exclaimed
when
I
had
read
her
letter
,
``
I
will
*NL*
write
instantly
,
and
relieve
them
from
the
anxiety
they
must
feel
.
''
I
*NL*
wrote
,
and
this
exertion
greatly
fatigued
me
;
but
my
convalescence
had
*NL*
commenced
,
and
proceeded
regularly
.
In
another
fortnight
I
was
able
to
*NL*
leave
my
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
my
first
duties
on
my
recovery
was
to
introduce
Clerval
to
the
*NL*
several
professors
of
the
university
.
In
doing
this
,
I
underwent
a
kind
*NL*
of
rough
usage
,
ill
befitting
the
wounds
that
my
mind
had
sustained
.
*NL*
Ever
since
the
fatal
night
,
the
end
of
my
labours
,
and
the
beginning
of
*NL*
my
misfortunes
,
I
had
conceived
a
violent
antipathy
even
to
the
name
of
*NL*
natural
philosophy
.
When
I
was
otherwise
quite
restored
to
health
,
the
*NL*
sight
of
a
chemical
instrument
would
renew
all
the
agony
of
my
nervous
*NL*
symptoms
.
Henry
saw
this
,
and
had
removed
all
my
apparatus
from
my
view
.
*NL*
He
had
also
changed
my
apartment
;
for
he
perceived
that
I
had
acquired
a
*NL*
dislike
for
the
room
which
had
previously
been
my
laboratory
.
But
these
*NL*
cares
of
Clerval
were
made
of
no
avail
when
I
visited
the
professors
.
M.
*NL*
Waldman
inflicted
torture
when
he
praised
,
with
kindness
and
warmth
,
the
*NL*
astonishing
progress
I
had
made
in
the
sciences
.
He
soon
perceived
that
*NL*
I
disliked
the
subject
;
but
,
not
guessing
the
real
cause
,
he
attributed
*NL*
my
feelings
to
modesty
,
and
changed
the
subject
from
my
improvement
to
*NL*
the
science
itself
,
with
a
desire
,
as
I
evidently
saw
,
of
drawing
me
*NL*
out
.
What
could
I
do
?
He
meant
to
please
,
and
he
tormented
me
.
I
felt
as
*NL*
if
he
had
placed
carefully
,
one
by
one
,
in
my
view
those
instruments
*NL*
which
were
to
be
afterwards
used
in
putting
me
to
a
slow
and
cruel
*NL*
death
.
I
writhed
under
his
words
,
yet
dared
not
exhibit
the
pain
I
felt
.
*NL*
Clerval
,
whose
eyes
and
feelings
were
always
quick
in
discerning
the
*NL*
sensations
of
others
,
declined
the
subject
,
alleging
,
in
excuse
,
his
*NL*
total
ignorance
;
and
the
conversation
took
a
more
general
turn
.
I
*NL*
thanked
my
friend
from
my
heart
,
but
I
did
not
speak
.
I
saw
plainly
that
*NL*
he
was
surprised
,
but
he
never
attempted
to
draw
my
secret
from
me
;
and
*NL*
although
I
loved
him
with
a
mixture
of
affection
and
reverence
that
knew
*NL*
no
bounds
,
yet
I
could
never
persuade
myself
to
confide
to
him
that
*NL*
event
which
was
so
often
present
to
my
recollection
,
but
which
I
feared
*NL*
the
detail
to
another
would
only
impress
more
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Krempe
was
not
equally
docile
;
and
in
my
condition
at
that
time
,
of
*NL*
almost
insupportable
sensitiveness
,
his
harsh
blunt
encomiums
gave
me
*NL*
even
more
pain
than
the
benevolent
approbation
of
M.
Waldman
.
``
D
--
n
the
*NL*
fellow
!
''
cried
he
;
``
why
,
M.
Clerval
,
I
assure
you
he
has
outstript
us
*NL*
all
.
Aye
,
stare
if
you
please
;
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
.
A
youngster
*NL*
who
,
but
a
few
years
ago
,
believed
Cornelius
Agrippa
as
firmly
as
the
*NL*
gospel
,
has
now
set
himself
at
the
head
of
the
university
;
and
if
he
is
*NL*
not
soon
pulled
down
,
we
shall
all
be
out
of
countenance
.
--
Aye
,
aye
,
''
*NL*
continued
he
,
observing
my
face
expressive
of
suffering
,
``
M.
*NL*
Frankenstein
is
modest
;
an
excellent
quality
in
a
young
man
.
Young
men
*NL*
should
be
diffident
of
themselves
,
you
know
,
M.
Clerval
;
I
was
myself
*NL*
when
young
:
but
that
wears
out
in
a
very
short
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Krempe
had
now
commenced
an
eulogy
on
himself
,
which
happily
turned
*NL*
the
conversation
from
a
subject
that
was
so
annoying
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clerval
was
no
natural
philosopher
.
His
imagination
was
too
vivid
for
*NL*
the
minutiae
of
science
.
Languages
were
his
principal
study
;
and
he
*NL*
sought
,
by
acquiring
their
elements
,
to
open
a
field
for
*NL*
self-instruction
on
his
return
to
Geneva
.
Persian
,
Arabic
,
and
Hebrew
,
*NL*
gained
his
attention
,
after
he
had
made
himself
perfectly
master
of
*NL*
Greek
and
Latin
.
For
my
own
part
,
idleness
had
ever
been
irksome
to
me
;
*NL*
and
now
that
I
wished
to
fly
from
reflection
,
and
hated
my
former
*NL*
studies
,
I
felt
great
relief
in
being
the
fellow-pupil
with
my
friend
,
*NL*
and
found
not
only
instruction
but
consolation
in
the
works
of
the
*NL*
orientalists
.
Their
melancholy
is
soothing
,
and
their
joy
elevating
to
a
*NL*
degree
I
never
experienced
in
studying
the
authors
of
any
other
country
.
*NL*
When
you
read
their
writings
,
life
appears
to
consist
in
a
warm
sun
and
*NL*
garden
of
roses
,
--
in
the
smiles
and
frowns
of
a
fair
enemy
,
and
the
fire
*NL*
that
consumes
your
own
heart
.
How
different
from
the
manly
and
heroical
*NL*
poetry
of
Greece
and
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
Summer
passed
away
in
these
occupations
,
and
my
return
to
Geneva
was
*NL*
fixed
for
the
latter
end
of
autumn
;
but
being
delayed
by
several
*NL*
accidents
,
winter
and
snow
arrived
,
the
roads
were
deemed
impassable
,
*NL*
and
my
journey
was
retarded
until
the
ensuing
spring
.
I
felt
this
delay
*NL*
very
bitterly
;
for
I
longed
to
see
my
native
town
,
and
my
beloved
*NL*
friends
.
My
return
had
only
been
delayed
so
long
from
an
unwillingness
*NL*
to
leave
Clerval
in
a
strange
place
,
before
he
had
become
acquainted
*NL*
with
any
of
its
inhabitants
.
The
winter
,
however
,
was
spent
cheerfully
;
*NL*
and
although
the
spring
was
uncommonly
late
,
when
it
came
,
its
beauty
*NL*
compensated
for
its
dilatoriness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
month
of
May
had
already
commenced
,
and
I
expected
the
letter
daily
*NL*
which
was
to
fix
the
date
of
my
departure
,
when
Henry
proposed
a
*NL*
pedestrian
tour
in
the
environs
of
Ingolstadt
that
I
might
bid
a
*NL*
personal
farewell
to
the
country
I
had
so
long
inhabited
.
I
acceded
*NL*
with
pleasure
to
this
proposition
:
I
was
fond
of
exercise
,
and
Clerval
*NL*
had
always
been
my
favourite
companion
in
the
rambles
of
this
nature
*NL*
that
I
had
taken
among
the
scenes
of
my
native
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
passed
a
fortnight
in
these
perambulations
:
my
health
and
spirits
had
*NL*
long
been
restored
,
and
they
gained
additional
strength
from
the
*NL*
salubrious
air
I
breathed
,
the
natural
incidents
of
our
progress
,
and
*NL*
the
conversation
of
my
friend
.
Study
had
before
secluded
me
from
the
*NL*
intercourse
of
my
fellow-creatures
,
and
rendered
me
unsocial
;
but
*NL*
Clerval
called
forth
the
better
feelings
of
my
heart
;
he
again
taught
me
*NL*
to
love
the
aspect
of
nature
,
and
the
cheerful
faces
of
children
.
*NL*
Excellent
friend
!
how
sincerely
did
you
love
me
,
and
endeavour
to
*NL*
elevate
my
mind
,
until
it
was
on
a
level
with
your
own
.
A
selfish
*NL*
pursuit
had
cramped
and
narrowed
me
,
until
your
gentleness
and
affection
*NL*
warmed
and
opened
my
senses
;
I
became
the
same
happy
creature
who
,
a
few
*NL*
years
ago
,
loving
and
beloved
by
all
,
had
no
sorrow
or
care
.
When
happy
,
*NL*
inanimate
nature
had
the
power
of
bestowing
on
me
the
most
delightful
*NL*
sensations
.
A
serene
sky
and
verdant
fields
filled
me
with
ecstacy
.
The
*NL*
present
season
was
indeed
divine
;
the
flowers
of
spring
bloomed
in
the
*NL*
hedges
,
while
those
of
summer
were
already
in
bud
:
I
was
undisturbed
by
*NL*
thoughts
which
during
the
preceding
year
had
pressed
upon
me
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
my
endeavours
to
throw
them
off
,
with
an
invincible
*NL*
burden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
rejoiced
in
my
gaiety
,
and
sincerely
sympathized
in
my
feelings
:
*NL*
he
exerted
himself
to
amuse
me
,
while
he
expressed
the
sensations
that
*NL*
filled
his
soul
.
The
resources
of
his
mind
on
this
occasion
were
truly
*NL*
astonishing
:
his
conversation
was
full
of
imagination
;
and
very
often
,
*NL*
in
imitation
of
the
Persian
and
Arabic
writers
,
he
invented
tales
of
*NL*
wonderful
fancy
and
passion
.
At
other
times
he
repeated
my
favourite
*NL*
poems
,
or
drew
me
out
into
arguments
,
which
he
supported
with
great
*NL*
ingenuity
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
returned
to
our
college
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
:
the
peasants
were
*NL*
dancing
,
and
every
one
we
met
appeared
gay
and
happy
.
My
own
spirits
*NL*
were
high
,
and
I
bounded
along
with
feelings
of
unbridled
joy
and
*NL*
hilarity
.

impatiently
for
a
letter
to
fix
the
date
of
*NL*
your
return
to
us
;
and
I
was
at
first
tempted
to
write
only
a
few
lines
,
*NL*
merely
mentioning
the
day
on
which
I
should
expect
you
.
But
that
would
*NL*
be
a
cruel
kindness
,
and
I
dare
not
do
it
.
What
would
be
your
surprise
,
*NL*
my
son
,
when
you
expected
a
happy
and
gay
welcome
,
to
behold
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
tears
and
wretchedness
?
And
how
,
Victor
,
can
I
relate
our
*NL*
misfortune
?
Absence
can
not
have
rendered
you
callous
to
our
joys
and
*NL*
griefs
;
and
how
shall
I
inflict
pain
on
an
absent
child
?
I
wish
to
*NL*
prepare
you
for
the
woeful
news
,
but
I
know
it
is
impossible
;
even
now
*NL*
your
eye
skims
over
the
page
,
to
seek
the
words
which
are
to
convey
to
*NL*
you
the
horrible
tidings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
William
is
dead
!
--
that
sweet
child

smiles
delighted
and
warmed

gentle

so
gay

``
Last
Thursday
-LRB-
May
7th
-RRB-
I
,
my
niece
,
and
your
two
brothers
,
went
to
*NL*
walk
in
Plainpalais
.
The
evening
was
warm
and
serene
,
and
we
prolonged
*NL*
our
walk
farther
than
usual
.
It
was
already
dusk
before
we
thought
of
*NL*
returning
;
and
then
we
discovered
that
William
and
Ernest
,
who
had
gone
*NL*
on
before
,
were
not
to
be
found
.
We
accordingly
rested
on
a
seat
until
*NL*
they
should
return
.
Presently
Ernest
came
,
and
inquired
if
we
had
seen
*NL*
his
brother
:
he
said
,
that
they
had
been
playing
together
,
that
William
*NL*
had
run
away
to
hide
himself
,
and
that
he
vainly
sought
for
him
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
waited
for
him
a
long
time
,
but
that
he
did
not
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
account
rather
alarmed
us
,
and
we
continued
to
search
for
him
*NL*
until
night
fell
,
when
Elizabeth
conjectured
that
he
might
have
returned
*NL*
to
the
house
.
He
was
not
there
.
We
returned
again
,
with
torches
;
for
I
*NL*
could
not
rest
,
when
I
thought
that
my
sweet
boy
had
lost
himself
,
and
*NL*
was
exposed
to
all
the
damps
and
dews
of
night
:
Elizabeth
also
suffered
*NL*
extreme
anguish
.
About
five
in
the
morning
I
discovered
my
lovely
boy
,
*NL*
whom
the
night
before
I
had
seen
blooming
and
active
in
health
,
*NL*
stretched
on
the
grass
livid
and
motionless
:
the
print
of
the
murderer
's
*NL*
finger
was
on
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
conveyed
home
,
and
the
anguish
that
was
visible
in
my
*NL*
countenance
betrayed
the
secret
to
Elizabeth
.
She
was
very
earnest
to
*NL*
see
the
corpse
.
At
first
I
attempted
to
prevent
her
;
but
she
persisted
,
*NL*
and
entering
the
room
where
it
lay
,
hastily
examined
the
neck
of
the
*NL*
victim
,
and
clasping
her
hands
exclaimed
,
'
O
God
!
I
have
murdered
my
*NL*
darling
infant
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
fainted
,
and
was
restored
with
extreme
difficulty
.
When
she
again
*NL*
lived
,
it
was
only
to
weep
and
sigh
.
She
told
me
,
that
that
same
evening
*NL*
William
had
teazed
her
to
let
him
wear
a
very
valuable
miniature
that
*NL*
she
possessed
of
your
mother
.
This
picture
is
gone
,
and
was
doubtless
*NL*
the
temptation
which
urged
the
murderer
to
the
deed
.
We
have
no
trace
of
*NL*
him
at
present
,
although
our
exertions
to
discover
him
are
unremitted
;
*NL*
but
they
will
not
restore
my
beloved
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
dearest
Victor
;
you
alone
can
console
Elizabeth
.
She
weeps
*NL*
continually
,
and
accuses
herself
unjustly
as
the
cause
of
his
death
;
her
*NL*
words
pierce
my
heart
.
We
are
all
unhappy
;
but
will
not
that
be
an
*NL*
additional
motive
for
you
,
my
son
,
to
return
and
be
our
comforter
?
Your
*NL*
dear
mother

Alas
,
Victor
!
I
now
say
,
Thank
God
she
did
not
live
to
*NL*
witness
the
cruel
,
miserable
death
of
her
youngest
darling
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Victor
;
not
brooding
thoughts
of
vengeance
against
the
assassin
,
*NL*
but
with
feelings
of
peace
and
gentleness
,
that
will
heal
,
instead
of
*NL*
festering
the
wounds
of
our
minds
.
Enter
the
house
of
mourning
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
but
with
kindness
and
affection
for
those
who
love
you

with
hatred
for
your
enemies

*NL*
*NL*
Clerval
,
who
had
watched
my
countenance
as
I
read
this
letter
,
was
*NL*
surprised
to
observe
the
despair
that
succeeded
to
the
joy
I
at
first
*NL*
expressed
on
receiving
news
from
my
friends
.
I
threw
the
letter
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Frankenstein

''
exclaimed
Henry
,
when
he
perceived
me
weep
with
*NL*
bitterness
,
``
are
you
always
to
be
unhappy
?
My
dear
friend

what
has
*NL*
happened

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
motioned
to
him
to
take
up
the
letter
,
while
I
walked
up
and
down
the
*NL*
room
in
the
extremest
agitation
.
Tears
also
gushed
from
the
eyes
of
*NL*
Clerval
,
as
he
read
the
account
of
my
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
offer
you
no
consolation
,
my
friend

''
said
he
;
``
your
disaster
is
*NL*
irreparable

What
do
you
intend
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To

''
*NL*
*NL*
During
our
walk
,
Clerval
endeavoured
to
raise
my
spirits
.
He
did
not
do
*NL*
this
by
common
topics
of
consolation
,
but
by
exhibiting
the
truest
*NL*
sympathy
.
``
Poor
William
!
''
said
he
,
``
that
dear
child
;
he
now
sleeps
with
*NL*
his
angel
mother
.
His
friends
mourn
and
weep
,
but
he
is
at
rest
:
he
does
*NL*
not
now
feel
the
murderer
's
grasp
;
a
sod
covers
his
gentle
form
,
and
he
*NL*
knows
no
pain
.
He
can
no
longer
be
a
fit
subject
for
pity
;
the
survivors
*NL*
are
the
greatest
sufferers
,
and
for
them
time
is
the
only
consolation

*NL*
Those
maxims
of
the
Stoics
,
that
death
was
no
evil
,
and
that
the
mind
of
*NL*
man
ought
to
be
superior
to
despair
on
the
eternal
absence
of
a
beloved
*NL*
object
,
ought
not
to
be
urged
.

Cato

over
the

of
his
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Clerval
spoke
thus
as
we
hurried
through
the
streets
;
the
words
*NL*
impressed
themselves
on
my
mind
,
and
I
remembered
them
afterwards
in
*NL*
solitude
.
But
now
,
as
soon
as
the
horses
arrived
,
I
hurried
into
a
*NL*
cabriole
,
and
bade
farewell
to
my
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
journey
was
very
melancholy
.
At
first
I
wished
to
hurry
on
,
for
I
*NL*
longed
to
console
and
sympathize
with
my
loved
and
sorrowing
friends
;
*NL*
but
when
I
drew
near
my
native
town
,
I
slackened
my
progress
.
I
could
*NL*
hardly
sustain
the
multitude
of
feelings
that
crowded
into
my
mind
.
I
*NL*
passed
through
scenes
familiar
to
my
youth
,
but
which
I
had
not
seen
for
*NL*
nearly
six
years
.
How
altered
every
thing
might
be
during
that
time
?
One
*NL*
sudden
and
desolating
change
had
taken
place
;
but
a
thousand
little
*NL*
circumstances
might
have
by
degrees
worked
other
alterations
which
,
*NL*
although
they
were
done
more
tranquilly
,
might
not
be
the
less
decisive
.
*NL*
Fear
overcame
me
;
I
dared
not
advance
,
dreading
a
thousand
nameless
*NL*
evils
that
made
me
tremble
,
although
I
was
unable
to
define
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remained
two
days
at
Lausanne
,
in
this
painful
state
of
mind
.
I
*NL*
contemplated
the
lake
:
the
waters
were
placid
;
all
around
was
calm
,
and
*NL*
the
snowy
mountains
,
``
the
palaces
of
nature
,
''
were
not
changed
.
By
*NL*
degrees
the
calm
and
heavenly
scene
restored
me
,
and
I
continued
my
*NL*
journey
towards
Geneva
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
road
ran
by
the
side
of
the
lake
,
which
became
narrower
as
I
*NL*
approached
my
native
town
.
I
discovered
more
distinctly
the
black
sides
*NL*
of
Jura
,
and
the
bright
summit
of
Mont
Blanc
;
I
wept
like
a
child
:
``
Dear
*NL*
mountains
!
my
own
beautiful
lake
!
how
do
you
welcome
your
wanderer
?
Your
*NL*
summits
are
clear
;
the
sky
and
lake
are
blue
and
placid
.
Is
this
to
*NL*
prognosticate
peace
,
or
to
mock
at
my
unhappiness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
fear
,
my
friend
,
that
I
shall
render
myself
tedious
by
dwelling
on
*NL*
these
preliminary
circumstances
;
but
they
were
days
of
comparative
*NL*
happiness
,
and
I
think
of
them
with
pleasure
.
My
country
,
my
beloved
*NL*
country
!
who
but
a
native
can
tell
the
delight
I
took
in
again
beholding
*NL*
thy
streams
,
thy
mountains
,
and
,
more
than
all
,
thy
lovely
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
as
I
drew
nearer
home
,
grief
and
fear
again
overcame
me
.
Night
also
*NL*
closed
around
;
and
when
I
could
hardly
see
the
dark
mountains
,
I
felt
*NL*
still
more
gloomily
.
The
picture
appeared
a
vast
and
dim
scene
of
evil
,
*NL*
and
I
foresaw
obscurely
that
I
was
destined
to
become
the
most
wretched
*NL*
of
human
beings
.
Alas
!
I
prophesied
truly
,
and
failed
only
in
one
single
*NL*
circumstance
,
that
in
all
the
misery
I
imagined
and
dreaded
,
I
did
not
*NL*
conceive
the
hundredth
part
of
the
anguish
I
was
destined
to
endure
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
completely
dark
when
I
arrived
in
the
environs
of
Geneva
;
the
*NL*
gates
of
the
town
were
already
shut
;
and
I
was
obliged
to
pass
the
night
*NL*
at
Secheron
,
a
village
half
a
league
to
the
east
of
the
city
.
The
sky
*NL*
was
serene
;
and
,
as
I
was
unable
to
rest
,
I
resolved
to
visit
the
spot
*NL*
where
my
poor
William
had
been
murdered
.
As
I
could
not
pass
through
the
*NL*
town
,
I
was
obliged
to
cross
the
lake
in
a
boat
to
arrive
at
*NL*
Plainpalais
.
During
this
short
voyage
I
saw
the
lightnings
playing
on
*NL*
the
summit
of
Mont
Blanc
in
the
most
beautiful
figures
.
The
storm
*NL*
appeared
to
approach
rapidly
;
and
,
on
landing
,
I
ascended
a
low
hill
,
*NL*
that
I
might
observe
its
progress
.
It
advanced
;
the
heavens
were
*NL*
clouded
,
and
I
soon
felt
the
rain
coming
slowly
in
large
drops
,
but
its
*NL*
violence
quickly
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
quitted
my
seat
,
and
walked
on
,
although
the
darkness
and
storm
*NL*
increased
every
minute
,
and
the
thunder
burst
with
a
terrific
crash
*NL*
over
my
head
.
It
was
echoed
from
Saleve
,
the
Juras
,
and
the
Alps
of
*NL*
Savoy
;
vivid
flashes
of
lightning
dazzled
my
eyes
,
illuminating
the
*NL*
lake
,
making
it
appear
like
a
vast
sheet
of
fire
;
then
for
an
instant
*NL*
every
thing
seemed
of
a
pitchy
darkness
,
until
the
eye
recovered
itself
*NL*
from
the
preceding
flash
.
The
storm
,
as
is
often
the
case
in
*NL*
Switzerland
,
appeared
at
once
in
various
parts
of
the
heavens
.
The
most
*NL*
violent
storm
hung
exactly
north
of
the
town
,
over
that
part
of
the
lake
*NL*
which
lies
between
the
promontory
of
Belrive
and
the
village
of
Copet
.
*NL*
Another
storm
enlightened
Jura
with
faint
flashes
;
and
another
darkened
*NL*
and
sometimes
disclosed
the
Mole
,
a
peaked
mountain
to
the
east
of
the
*NL*
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
watched
the
storm
,
so
beautiful
yet
terrific
,
I
wandered
on
with
*NL*
a
hasty
step
.
This
noble
war
in
the
sky
elevated
my
spirits
;
I
clasped
*NL*
my
hands
,
and
exclaimed
aloud
,
``
William
,
dear
angel
!
this
is
thy
*NL*
funeral
,
this
thy
dirge
!
''
As
I
said
these
words
,
I
perceived
in
the
*NL*
gloom
a
figure
which
stole
from
behind
a
clump
of
trees
near
me
;
I
stood
*NL*
fixed
,
gazing
intently
:
I
could
not
be
mistaken
.
A
flash
of
lightning
*NL*
illuminated
the
object
,
and
discovered
its
shape
plainly
to
me
;
its
*NL*
gigantic
stature
,
and
the
deformity
of
its
aspect
,
more
hideous
than
*NL*
belongs
to
humanity
,
instantly
informed
me
that
it
was
the
wretch
,
the
*NL*
filthy
daemon
to
whom
I
had
given
life
.
What
did
he
there
?
Could
he
be
-LRB-
I
*NL*
shuddered
at
the
conception
-RRB-
the
murderer
of
my
brother
?
No
sooner
did
*NL*
that
idea
cross
my
imagination
,
than
I
became
convinced
of
its
truth
;
my
*NL*
teeth
chattered
,
and
I
was
forced
to
lean
against
a
tree
for
support
.
*NL*
The
figure
passed
me
quickly
,
and
I
lost
it
in
the
gloom
.
Nothing
in
*NL*
human
shape
could
have
destroyed
that
fair
child
.
_
He
_
was
the
murderer
!
*NL*
I
could
not
doubt
it
.
The
mere
presence
of
the
idea
was
an
irresistible
*NL*
proof
of
the
fact
.
I
thought
of
pursuing
the
devil
;
but
it
would
have
*NL*
been
in
vain
,
for
another
flash
discovered
him
to
me
hanging
among
the
*NL*
rocks
of
the
nearly
perpendicular
ascent
of
Mont
Saleve
,
a
hill
that
*NL*
bounds
Plainpalais
on
the
south
.
He
soon
reached
the
summit
,
and
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remained
motionless
.
The
thunder
ceased
;
but
the
rain
still
continued
,
*NL*
and
the
scene
was
enveloped
in
an
impenetrable
darkness
.
I
revolved
in
*NL*
my
mind
the
events
which
I
had
until
now
sought
to
forget
:
the
whole
*NL*
train
of
my
progress
towards
the
creation
;
the
appearance
of
the
work
of
*NL*
my
own
hands
alive
at
my
bed
side
;
its
departure
.
Two
years
had
now
*NL*
nearly
elapsed
since
the
night
on
which
he
first
received
life
;
and
was
*NL*
this
his
first
crime
?
Alas
!
I
had
turned
loose
into
the
world
a
depraved
*NL*
wretch
,
whose
delight
was
in
carnage
and
misery
;
had
he
not
murdered
my
*NL*
brother
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
can
conceive
the
anguish
I
suffered
during
the
remainder
of
the
*NL*
night
,
which
I
spent
,
cold
and
wet
,
in
the
open
air
.
But
I
did
not
feel
*NL*
the
inconvenience
of
the
weather
;
my
imagination
was
busy
in
scenes
of
*NL*
evil
and
despair
.
I
considered
the
being
whom
I
had
cast
among
mankind
,
*NL*
and
endowed
with
the
will
and
power
to
effect
purposes
of
horror
,
such
*NL*
as
the
deed
which
he
had
now
done
,
nearly
in
the
light
of
my
own
*NL*
vampire
,
my
own
spirit
let
loose
from
the
grave
,
and
forced
to
destroy
*NL*
all
that
was
dear
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
dawned
;
and
I
directed
my
steps
towards
the
town
.
The
gates
were
*NL*
open
;
and
I
hastened
to
my
father
's
house
.
My
first
thought
was
to
*NL*
discover
what
I
knew
of
the
murderer
,
and
cause
instant
pursuit
to
be
*NL*
made
.
But
I
paused
when
I
reflected
on
the
story
that
I
had
to
tell
.
A
*NL*
being
whom
I
myself
had
formed
,
and
endued
with
life
,
had
met
me
at
*NL*
midnight
among
the
precipices
of
an
inaccessible
mountain
.
I
remembered
*NL*
also
the
nervous
fever
with
which
I
had
been
seized
just
at
the
time
*NL*
that
I
dated
my
creation
,
and
which
would
give
an
air
of
delirium
to
a
*NL*
tale
otherwise
so
utterly
improbable
.
I
well
knew
that
if
any
other
had
*NL*
communicated
such
a
relation
to
me
,
I
should
have
looked
upon
it
as
the
*NL*
ravings
of
insanity
.
Besides
,
the
strange
nature
of
the
animal
would
*NL*
elude
all
pursuit
,
even
if
I
were
so
far
credited
as
to
persuade
my
*NL*
relatives
to
commence
it
.
Besides
,
of
what
use
would
be
pursuit
?
Who
*NL*
could
arrest
a
creature
capable
of
scaling
the
overhanging
sides
of
Mont
*NL*
Saleve
?
These
reflections
determined
me
,
and
I
resolved
to
remain
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
five
in
the
morning
when
I
entered
my
father
's
house
.
I
*NL*
told
the
servants
not
to
disturb
the
family
,
and
went
into
the
library
*NL*
to
attend
their
usual
hour
of
rising
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
years
had
elapsed
,
passed
as
a
dream
but
for
one
indelible
trace
,
*NL*
and
I
stood
in
the
same
place
where
I
had
last
embraced
my
father
before
*NL*
my
departure
for
Ingolstadt
.
Beloved
and
respectable
parent
!
He
still
*NL*
remained
to
me
.
I
gazed
on
the
picture
of
my
mother
,
which
stood
over
*NL*
the
mantle-piece
.
It
was
an
historical
subject
,
painted
at
my
father
's
*NL*
desire
,
and
represented
Caroline
Beaufort
in
an
agony
of
despair
,
*NL*
kneeling
by
the
coffin
of
her
dead
father
.
Her
garb
was
rustic
,
and
her
*NL*
cheek
pale
;
but
there
was
an
air
of
dignity
and
beauty
,
that
hardly
*NL*
permitted
the
sentiment
of
pity
.
Below
this
picture
was
a
miniature
of
*NL*
William
;
and
my
tears
flowed
when
I
looked
upon
it
.
While
I
was
thus
*NL*
engaged
,
Ernest
entered
:
he
had
heard
me
arrive
,
and
hastened
to
welcome
*NL*
me
.
He
expressed
a
sorrowful
delight
to
see
me
:
``
Welcome
,
my
dearest
*NL*
Victor
,
''
said
he
.
``
Ah
!
I
wish
you
had
come
three
months
ago
,
and
then
*NL*
you
would
have
found
us
all
joyous
and
delighted
.
But
we
are
now
*NL*
unhappy
;
and
,
I
am
afraid
,
tears
instead
of
smiles
will
be
your
welcome
.
*NL*
Our
father
looks
so
sorrowful
:
this
dreadful
event
seems
to
have
revived
*NL*
in
his
mind
his
grief
on
the
death
of
Mamma
.
Poor
Elizabeth
also
is
*NL*
quite
inconsolable
.
''
Ernest
began
to
weep
as
he
said
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
,
''
said
I
,
``
welcome
me
thus
;
try
to
be
more
calm
,
that
I
may
not
*NL*
be
absolutely
miserable
the
moment
I
enter
my
father
's
house
after
so
*NL*
long
an
absence
.
But
,
tell
me
,
how
does
my
father
support
his
*NL*
misfortunes
?
and
how
is
my
poor
Elizabeth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
indeed
requires
consolation
;
she
accused
herself
of
having
caused
*NL*
the
death
of
my
brother
,
and
that
made
her
very
wretched
.
But
since
the
*NL*
murderer
has
been
discovered
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
murderer
discovered
!
Good
God
!
how
can
that
be
?
who
could
attempt
*NL*
to
pursue
him
?
It
is
impossible
;
one
might
as
well
try
to
overtake
the
*NL*
winds
,
or
confine
a
mountain-stream
with
a
straw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean

but
we
were
all
very
unhappy
when
she
was
*NL*
discovered

No
one
would
believe
it
at
first
;
and
even
now
Elizabeth
*NL*
will
not
be
convinced
,
notwithstanding
all
the
evidence
.
Indeed
,
who
*NL*
would
credit
that
Justine
Moritz
,
who
was
so
amiable
,
and
fond
of
all
*NL*

all
at

extremely
wicked

poor

is
she
the
accused

it
is

no
one
believes
it

surely

Ernest

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
did
at
first
;
but
several
circumstances
came
out

that
have
*NL*
almost
forced
conviction
upon
us

and
her
own
behaviour
has
been
so
*NL*
confused

as
to
add
to
the
evidence
of
facts
a
weight
that
,
I
fear
,
*NL*
leaves
no
hope
for
doubt

But
she
will
be
tried
to-day

you

*NL*
*NL*
He
related
that
,
the
morning
on
which
the
murder
of
poor
William
had
*NL*
been
discovered
,
Justine
had
been
taken
ill
,
and
confined
to
her
bed
;
*NL*
and
,
after
several
days
,
one
of
the
servants
,
happening
to
examine
the
*NL*
apparel
she
had
worn
on
the
night
of
the
murder
,
had
discovered
in
her
*NL*
pocket
the
picture
of
my
mother
,
which
had
been
judged
to
be
the
*NL*
temptation
of
the
murderer
.
The
servant
instantly
shewed
it
to
one
of
*NL*
the
others
,
who
,
without
saying
a
word
to
any
of
the
family
,
went
to
a
*NL*
magistrate
;
and
,
upon
their
deposition
,
Justine
was
apprehended
.
On
*NL*
being
charged
with
the
fact
,
the
poor
girl
confirmed
the
suspicion
in
a
*NL*
great
measure
by
her
extreme
confusion
of
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
strange
tale
,
but
it
did
not
shake
my
faith
;
and
I
replied
*NL*
earnestly
,
``
You
are
all
mistaken
;
I
know
the
murderer
.
Justine
,
poor
,
*NL*
good
Justine
,
is
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
my
father
entered
.
I
saw
unhappiness
deeply
impressed
on
*NL*
his
countenance
,
but
he
endeavoured
to
welcome
me
cheerfully
;
and
,
after
*NL*
we
had
exchanged
our
mournful
greeting
,
would
have
introduced
some
other
*NL*
topic
than
that
of
our
disaster
,
had
not
Ernest
exclaimed
,
``
Good
God
,
*NL*
Papa
!
Victor
says
that
he
knows
who
was
the
murderer
of
poor
William
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
also
,
unfortunately
,
''
replied
my
father
;
``
for
indeed
I
had
rather
*NL*
have
been
for
ever
ignorant
than
have
discovered
so
much
depravity
and
*NL*
ingratitude
in
one
I
valued
so
highly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
father
,
you
are
mistaken
;
Justine
is
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
is
,
God
forbid
that
she
should
suffer
as
guilty
.
She
is
to
be
*NL*
tried
to-day
,
and
I
hope
,
I
sincerely
hope
,
that
she
will
be
acquitted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
calmed
me
.
I
was
firmly
convinced
in
my
own
mind
that
*NL*
Justine
,
and
indeed
every
human
being
,
was
guiltless
of
this
murder
.
I
*NL*
had
no
fear
,
therefore
,
that
any
circumstantial
evidence
could
be
*NL*
brought
forward
strong
enough
to
convict
her
;
and
,
in
this
assurance
,
I
*NL*
calmed
myself
,
expecting
the
trial
with
eagerness
,
but
without
*NL*
prognosticating
an
evil
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
soon
joined
by
Elizabeth
.
Time
had
made
great
alterations
in
her
*NL*
form
since
I
had
last
beheld
her
.
Six
years
before
she
had
been
a
*NL*
pretty
,
good-humoured
girl
,
whom
every
one
loved
and
caressed
.
She
was
*NL*
now
a
woman
in
stature
and
expression
of
countenance
,
which
was
*NL*
uncommonly
lovely
.
An
open
and
capacious
forehead
gave
indications
of
a
*NL*
good
understanding
,
joined
to
great
frankness
of
disposition
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
were
hazel
,
and
expressive
of
mildness
,
now
through
recent
affliction
*NL*
allied
to
sadness
.
Her
hair
was
of
a
rich
,
dark
auburn
,
her
complexion
*NL*
fair
,
and
her
figure
slight
and
graceful
.
She
welcomed
me
with
the
*NL*
greatest
affection
.
``
Your
arrival
,
my
dear
cousin
,
''
said
she
,
``
fills
me
*NL*
with
hope
.
You
perhaps
will
find
some
means
to
justify
my
poor
guiltless
*NL*
Justine
.
Alas
!
who
is
safe
,
if
she
be
convicted
of
crime
?
I
rely
on
her
*NL*
innocence
as
certainly
as
I
do
upon
my
own
.
Our
misfortune
is
doubly
*NL*
hard
to
us
;
we
have
not
only
lost
that
lovely
darling
boy
,
but
this
poor
*NL*
girl
,
whom
I
sincerely
love
,
is
to
be
torn
away
by
even
a
worse
fate
.
If
*NL*
she
is
condemned
,
I
never
shall
know
joy
more
.
But
she
will
not
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
she
will
not
;
and
then
I
shall
be
happy
again
,
even
after
the
sad
*NL*
death
of
my
little
William
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
innocent
,
my
Elizabeth
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
that
shall
be
proved
;
*NL*
fear
nothing
,
but
let
your
spirits
be
cheered
by
the
assurance
of
her
*NL*
acquittal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
you
are
!
every
one
else
believes
in
her
guilt
,
and
that
made
*NL*
me
wretched
;
for
I
knew
that
it
was
impossible
:
and
to
see
every
one
*NL*
else
prejudiced
in
so
deadly
a
manner
,
rendered
me
hopeless
and
*NL*
despairing
.
''
She
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sweet
niece
,
''
said
my
father
,
``
dry
your
tears
.
If
she
is
,
as
you
*NL*
believe
,
innocent
,
rely
on
the
justice
of
our
judges
,
and
the
activity

with
which
I
shall
prevent
the
slightest
shadow
of
partiality

CHAPTER
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
passed
a
few
sad
hours
,
until
eleven
o'clock
,
when
the
trial
was
to
*NL*
commence
.
My
father
and
the
rest
of
the
family
being
obliged
to
attend
*NL*
as
witnesses
,
I
accompanied
them
to
the
court
.
During
the
whole
of
this
*NL*
wretched
mockery
of
justice
,
I
suffered
living
torture
.
It
was
to
be
*NL*
decided
,
whether
the
result
of
my
curiosity
and
lawless
devices
would
*NL*
cause
the
death
of
two
of
my
fellow-beings
:
one
a
smiling
babe
,
full
of
*NL*
innocence
and
joy
;
the
other
far
more
dreadfully
murdered
,
with
every
*NL*
aggravation
of
infamy
that
could
make
the
murder
memorable
in
horror
.
*NL*
Justine
also
was
a
girl
of
merit
,
and
possessed
qualities
which
promised
*NL*
to
render
her
life
happy
:
now
all
was
to
be
obliterated
in
an
*NL*
ignominious
grave
;
and
I
the
cause
!
A
thousand
times
rather
would
I
have
*NL*
confessed
myself
guilty
of
the
crime
ascribed
to
Justine
;
but
I
was
*NL*
absent
when
it
was
committed
,
and
such
a
declaration
would
have
been
*NL*
considered
as
the
ravings
of
a
madman
,
and
would
not
have
exculpated
her
*NL*
who
suffered
through
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appearance
of
Justine
was
calm
.
She
was
dressed
in
mourning
;
and
her
*NL*
countenance
,
always
engaging
,
was
rendered
,
by
the
solemnity
of
her
*NL*
feelings
,
exquisitely
beautiful
.
Yet
she
appeared
confident
in
*NL*
innocence
,
and
did
not
tremble
,
although
gazed
on
and
execrated
by
*NL*
thousands
;
for
all
the
kindness
which
her
beauty
might
otherwise
have
*NL*
excited
,
was
obliterated
in
the
minds
of
the
spectators
by
the
*NL*
imagination
of
the
enormity
she
was
supposed
to
have
committed
.
She
was
*NL*
tranquil
,
yet
her
tranquillity
was
evidently
constrained
;
and
as
her
*NL*
confusion
had
before
been
adduced
as
a
proof
of
her
guilt
,
she
worked
up
*NL*
her
mind
to
an
appearance
of
courage
.
When
she
entered
the
court
,
she
*NL*
threw
her
eyes
round
it
,
and
quickly
discovered
where
we
were
seated
.
A
*NL*
tear
seemed
to
dim
her
eye
when
she
saw
us
;
but
she
quickly
recovered
*NL*
herself
,
and
a
look
of
sorrowful
affection
seemed
to
attest
her
utter
*NL*
guiltlessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trial
began
;
and
after
the
advocate
against
her
had
stated
the
*NL*
charge
,
several
witnesses
were
called
.
Several
strange
facts
combined
*NL*
against
her
,
which
might
have
staggered
any
one
who
had
not
such
proof
*NL*
of
her
innocence
as
I
had
.
She
had
been
out
the
whole
of
the
night
on
*NL*
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
,
and
towards
morning
had
been
*NL*
perceived
by
a
market-woman
not
far
from
the
spot
where
the
body
of
the
*NL*
murdered
child
had
been
afterwards
found
.
The
woman
asked
her
what
she
*NL*
did
there
;
but
she
looked
very
strangely
,
and
only
returned
a
confused
*NL*
and
unintelligible
answer
.
She
returned
to
the
house
about
eight
*NL*
o'clock
;
and
when
one
inquired
where
she
had
passed
the
night
,
she
*NL*
replied
,
that
she
had
been
looking
for
the
child
,
and
demanded
*NL*
earnestly
,
if
any
thing
had
been
heard
concerning
him
.
When
shewn
the
*NL*
body
,
she
fell
into
violent
hysterics
,
and
kept
her
bed
for
several
*NL*
days
.
The
picture
was
then
produced
,
which
the
servant
had
found
in
her
*NL*
pocket
;
and
when
Elizabeth
,
in
a
faltering
voice
,
proved
that
it
was
the
*NL*
same
which
,
an
hour
before
the
child
had
been
missed
,
she
had
placed
*NL*
round
his
neck
,
a
murmur
of
horror
and
indignation
filled
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
Justine
was
called
on
for
her
defence
.
As
the
trial
had
proceeded
,
her
*NL*
countenance
had
altered
.
Surprise
,
horror
,
and
misery
,
were
strongly
*NL*
expressed
.
Sometimes
she
struggled
with
her
tears
;
but
when
she
was
*NL*
desired
to
plead
,
she
collected
her
powers
,
and
spoke
in
an
audible
*NL*
although
variable
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
,
''
she
said
,
``
how
entirely
I
am
innocent
.
But
I
do
not
pretend
*NL*
that
my
protestations
should
acquit
me
:
I
rest
my
innocence
on
a
plain
*NL*
and
simple
explanation
of
the
facts
which
have
been
adduced
against
me
;
*NL*
and
I
hope
the
character
I
have
always
borne
will
incline
my
judges
to
a
*NL*
favourable
interpretation
,
where
any
circumstance
appears
doubtful
or
*NL*
suspicious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
related
that
,
by
the
permission
of
Elizabeth
,
she
had
passed
*NL*
the
evening
of
the
night
on
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
,
at
the
*NL*
house
of
an
aunt
at
Chene
,
a
village
situated
at
about
a
league
from
*NL*
Geneva
.
On
her
return
,
at
about
nine
o'clock
,
she
met
a
man
,
who
asked
*NL*
her
if
she
had
seen
any
thing
of
the
child
who
was
lost
.
She
was
alarmed
*NL*
by
this
account
,
and
passed
several
hours
in
looking
for
him
,
when
the
*NL*
gates
of
Geneva
were
shut
,
and
she
was
forced
to
remain
several
hours
of
*NL*
the
night
in
a
barn
belonging
to
a
cottage
,
being
unwilling
to
call
up
*NL*
the
inhabitants
,
to
whom
she
was
well
known
.
Unable
to
rest
or
sleep
,
*NL*
she
quitted
her
asylum
early
,
that
she
might
again
endeavour
to
find
my
*NL*
brother
.
If
she
had
gone
near
the
spot
where
his
body
lay
,
it
was
*NL*
without
her
knowledge
.
That
she
had
been
bewildered
when
questioned
by
*NL*
the
market-woman
,
was
not
surprising
,
since
she
had
passed
a
sleepless
*NL*
night
,
and
the
fate
of
poor
William
was
yet
uncertain
.
Concerning
the
*NL*
picture
she
could
give
no
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
continued
the
unhappy
victim
,
``
how
heavily
and
fatally
this
*NL*
one
circumstance
weighs
against
me
,
but
I
have
no
power
of
explaining
*NL*
it
;
and
when
I
have
expressed
my
utter
ignorance
,
I
am
only
left
to
*NL*
conjecture
concerning
the
probabilities
by
which
it
might
have
been
*NL*
placed
in
my
pocket
.
But
here
also
I
am
checked
.
I
believe
that
I
have
*NL*
no
enemy
on
earth
,
and
none
surely
would
have
been
so
wicked
as
to
*NL*
destroy
me
wantonly
.
Did
the
murderer
place
it
there
?
I
know
of
no
*NL*
opportunity
afforded
him
for
so
doing
;
or
if
I
had
,
why
should
he
have
*NL*
stolen
the
jewel
,
to
part
with
it
again
so
soon
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
commit
my
cause
to
the
justice
of
my
judges
,
yet
I
see
no
room
for
*NL*
hope
.
I
beg
permission
to
have
a
few
witnesses
examined
concerning
my
*NL*
character
;
and
if
their
testimony
shall
not
overweigh
my
supposed
guilt
,
*NL*
I
must
be
condemned
,
although
I
would
pledge
my
salvation
on
my
*NL*
innocence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
witnesses
were
called
,
who
had
known
her
for
many
years
,
and
*NL*
they
spoke
well
of
her
;
but
fear
,
and
hatred
of
the
crime
of
which
they
*NL*
supposed
her
guilty
,
rendered
them
timorous
,
and
unwilling
to
come
*NL*
forward
.
Elizabeth
saw
even
this
last
resource
,
her
excellent
*NL*
dispositions
and
irreproachable
conduct
,
about
to
fail
the
accused
,
*NL*
when
,
although
violently
agitated
,
she
desired
permission
to
address
the
*NL*
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
said
she
,
``
the
cousin
of
the
unhappy
child
who
was
murdered
,
or
*NL*
rather
his
sister
,
for
I
was
educated
by
and
have
lived
with
his
parents
*NL*
ever
since
and
even
long
before
his
birth
.
It
may
therefore
be
judged
*NL*
indecent
in
me
to
come
forward
on
this
occasion
;
but
when
I
see
a
*NL*
fellow-creature
about
to
perish
through
the
cowardice
of
her
pretended
*NL*
friends
,
I
wish
to
be
allowed
to
speak
,
that
I
may
say
what
I
know
of
*NL*
her
character
.
I
am
well
acquainted
with
the
accused
.
I
have
lived
in
*NL*
the
same
house
with
her
,
at
one
time
for
five
,
and
at
another
for
nearly
*NL*
two
years
.
During
all
that
period
she
appeared
to
me
the
most
amiable
*NL*
and
benevolent
of
human
creatures
.
She
nursed
Madame
Frankenstein
,
my
*NL*
aunt
,
in
her
last
illness
with
the
greatest
affection
and
care
;
and
*NL*
afterwards
attended
her
own
mother
during
a
tedious
illness
,
in
a
manner
*NL*
that
excited
the
admiration
of
all
who
knew
her
.
After
which
she
again
*NL*
lived
in
my
uncle
's
house
,
where
she
was
beloved
by
all
the
family
.
She
*NL*
was
warmly
attached
to
the
child
who
is
now
dead
,
and
acted
towards
him
*NL*
like
a
most
affectionate
mother
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
do
not
hesitate
to
*NL*
say
,
that
,
notwithstanding
all
the
evidence
produced
against
her
,
I
*NL*
believe
and
rely
on
her
perfect
innocence
.
She
had
no
temptation
for
*NL*
such
an
action
:
as
to
the
bauble
on
which
the
chief
proof
rests
,
if
she
*NL*
had
earnestly
desired
it
,
I
should
have
willingly
given
it
to
her
;
so
*NL*
much
do
I
esteem
and
value
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Excellent
Elizabeth
!
A
murmur
of
approbation
was
heard
;
but
it
was
*NL*
excited
by
her
generous
interference
,
and
not
in
favour
of
poor
Justine
,
*NL*
on
whom
the
public
indignation
was
turned
with
renewed
violence
,
*NL*
charging
her
with
the
blackest
ingratitude
.
She
herself
wept
as
*NL*
Elizabeth
spoke
,
but
she
did
not
answer
.
My
own
agitation
and
anguish
*NL*
was
extreme
during
the
whole
trial
.
I
believed
in
her
innocence
;
I
knew
*NL*
it
.
Could
the
daemon
,
who
had
-LRB-
I
did
not
for
a
minute
doubt
-RRB-
murdered
my
*NL*
brother
,
also
in
his
hellish
sport
have
betrayed
the
innocent
to
death
*NL*
and
ignominy
.
I
could
not
sustain
the
horror
of
my
situation
;
and
when
I
*NL*
perceived
that
the
popular
voice
,
and
the
countenances
of
the
judges
,
*NL*
had
already
condemned
my
unhappy
victim
,
I
rushed
out
of
the
court
in
*NL*
agony
.
The
tortures
of
the
accused
did
not
equal
mine
;
she
was
sustained
*NL*
by
innocence
,
but
the
fangs
of
remorse
tore
my
bosom
,
and
would
not
*NL*
forego
their
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
a
night
of
unmingled
wretchedness
.
In
the
morning
I
went
to
the
*NL*
court
;
my
lips
and
throat
were
parched
.
I
dared
not
ask
the
fatal
*NL*
question
;
but
I
was
known
,
and
the
officer
guessed
the
cause
of
my
*NL*
visit
.
The
ballots
had
been
thrown
;
they
were
all
black
,
and
Justine
was
*NL*
condemned
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
pretend
to
describe
what
I
then
felt
.
I
had
before
experienced
*NL*
sensations
of
horror
;
and
I
have
endeavoured
to
bestow
upon
them
*NL*
adequate
expressions
,
but
words
can
not
convey
an
idea
of
the
*NL*
heart-sickening
despair
that
I
then
endured
.
The
person
to
whom
I
*NL*
addressed
myself
added
,
that
Justine
had
already
confessed
her
guilt
.
*NL*
``
That
evidence
,
''
he
observed
,
``
was
hardly
required
in
so
glaring
a
case
,
*NL*
but
I
am
glad
of
it
;
and
,
indeed
,
none
of
our
judges
like
to
condemn
a
*NL*
criminal
upon
circumstantial
evidence
,
be
it
ever
so
decisive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
returned
home
,
Elizabeth
eagerly
demanded
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cousin
,
''
replied
I
,
``
it
is
decided
as
you
may
have
expected
;
all
*NL*
judges
had
rather
that
ten
innocent
should
suffer
,
than
that
one
guilty
*NL*
should
escape
.
But
she
has
confessed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
dire
blow
to
poor
Elizabeth
,
who
had
relied
with
firmness
*NL*
upon
Justine
's
innocence
.
``
Alas
!
''
said
she
,
``
how
shall
I
ever
again
*NL*
believe
in
human
benevolence
?
Justine
,
whom
I
loved
and
esteemed
as
my
*NL*
sister
,
how
could
she
put
on
those
smiles
of
innocence
only
to
betray
;
*NL*
her
mild
eyes
seemed
incapable
of
any
severity
or
ill-humour
,
and
yet
*NL*
she
has
committed
a
murder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
we
heard
that
the
poor
victim
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
my
*NL*
cousin
.
My
father
wished
her
not
to
go
;
but
said
,
that
he
left
it
to
her
*NL*
own
judgment
and
feelings
to
decide
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
I
will
go
,
*NL*
although
she
is
guilty
;
and
you
,
Victor
,
shall
accompany
me
:
I
can
not
go
*NL*
alone
.
''
The
idea
of
this
visit
was
torture
to
me
,
yet
I
could
not
*NL*
refuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
entered
the
gloomy
prison-chamber
,
and
beheld
Justine
sitting
on
some
*NL*
straw
at
the
further
end
;
her
hands
were
manacled
,
and
her
head
rested
*NL*
on
her
knees
.
She
rose
on
seeing
us
enter
;
and
when
we
were
left
alone
*NL*
with
her
,
she
threw
herself
at
the
feet
of
Elizabeth
,
weeping
bitterly
.
*NL*
My
cousin
wept
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Justine
!
''
said
she
,
``
why
did
you
rob
me
of
my
last
consolation
.
I
*NL*
relied
on
your
innocence
;
and
although
I
was
then
very
wretched
,
I
was
*NL*
not
so
miserable
as
I
am
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
also
believe
that
I
am
so
very
,
very
wicked
?
Do
you
also
*NL*
join
with
my
enemies
to
crush
me
?
''
Her
voice
was
suffocated
with
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rise
,
my
poor
girl
,
''
said
Elizabeth
,
``
why
do
you
kneel
,
if
you
are
*NL*
innocent
?
I
am
not
one
of
your
enemies
;
I
believed
you
guiltless
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
every
evidence
,
until
I
heard
that
you
had
yourself
*NL*
declared
your
guilt
.
That
report
,
you
say
,
is
false
;
and
be
assured
,
*NL*
dear
Justine
,
that
nothing
can
shake
my
confidence
in
you
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
but
your
own
confession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
confess
;
but
I
confessed
a
lie
.
I
confessed
,
that
I
might
obtain
*NL*
absolution
;
but
now
that
falsehood
lies
heavier
at
my
heart
than
all
my
*NL*
other
sins
.
The
God
of
heaven
forgive
me
!
Ever
since
I
was
condemned
,
my
*NL*
confessor
has
besieged
me
;
he
threatened
and
menaced
,
until
I
almost
*NL*
began
to
think
that
I
was
the
monster
that
he
said
I
was
.
He
threatened
*NL*
excommunication
and
hell
fire
in
my
last
moments
,
if
I
continued
*NL*
obdurate
.
Dear
lady
,
I
had
none
to
support
me
;
all
looked
on
me
as
a
*NL*
wretch
doomed
to
ignominy
and
perdition
.
What
could
I
do
?
In
an
evil
*NL*
hour
I
subscribed
to
a
lie
;
and
now
only
am
I
truly
miserable

*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
weeping
,
and
then
continued
--
``
I
thought
with
horror

will
try

this

is
an

bless

when
*NL*
one

is
murdered

reeking

greater

indeed
that

*NL*
Justine
smiled
languidly
.
``
This

*NL*
resignation
.
I
must
not
learn
the
lesson
that
you
would
teach
me
.
Talk
*NL*
of
something
else
,
something
that
will
bring
peace
,
and
not
increase
of
*NL*
misery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
conversation
I
had
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
prison-room
,
*NL*
where
I
could
conceal
the
horrid
anguish
that
possessed
me
.
Despair
!
Who
*NL*
dared
talk
of
that
?
The
poor
victim
,
who
on
the
morrow
was
to
pass
the
*NL*
dreary
boundary
between
life
and
death
,
felt
not
as
I
did
,
such
deep
and
*NL*
bitter
agony
.
I
gnashed
my
teeth
,
and
ground
them
together
,
uttering
a
*NL*
groan
that
came
from
my
inmost
soul
.
Justine
started
.
When
she
saw
who
*NL*
it
was
,
she
approached
me
,
and
said
,
``
Dear
Sir
,
you
are
very
kind
to
*NL*
visit
me
;
you
,
I
hope
,
do
not
believe
that
I
am
guilty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
answer
.
``
No
,
Justine
,
''
said
Elizabeth
;
``
he
is
more
convinced
*NL*
of
your
innocence
than
I
was
;
for
even
when
he
heard
that
you
had
*NL*
confessed
,
he
did
not
credit
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
truly
thank
him
.
In
these
last
moments
I
feel
the
sincerest
gratitude
*NL*
towards
those
who
think
of
me
with
kindness
.
How
sweet
is
the
affection
*NL*
of
others
to
such
a
wretch
as
I
am
!
It
removes
more
than
half
my
*NL*
misfortune
;
and
I
feel
as
if
I
could
die
in
peace
,
now
that
my
innocence
*NL*
is
acknowledged
by
you
,
dear
lady
,
and
your
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
poor
sufferer
tried
to
comfort
others
and
herself
.
She
indeed
*NL*
gained
the
resignation
she
desired
.
But
I
,
the
true
murderer
,
felt
the
*NL*
never-dying
worm
alive
in
my
bosom
,
which
allowed
of
no
hope
or
*NL*
consolation
.
Elizabeth
also
wept
,
and
was
unhappy
;
but
her
's
also
was
*NL*
the
misery
of
innocence
,
which
,
like
a
cloud
that
passes
over
the
fair
*NL*
moon
,
for
a
while
hides
,
but
can
not
tarnish
its
brightness
.
Anguish
and
*NL*
despair
had
penetrated
into
the
core
of
my
heart
;
I
bore
a
hell
within
*NL*
me
,
which
nothing
could
extinguish
.
We
staid
several
hours
with
Justine
;
*NL*
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
Elizabeth
could
tear
herself
away
.
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
cried
she
,
``
that
I
were
to
die
with
you
;
I
can
not
live
in
this
*NL*
world
of
misery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Justine
assumed
an
air
of
cheerfulness
,
while
she
with
difficulty
*NL*
repressed
her
bitter
tears
.
She
embraced
Elizabeth
,
and
said
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
of
half-suppressed
emotion
,
``
Farewell
,
sweet
lady
,
dearest
Elizabeth
,
my
*NL*
beloved
and
only
friend
;
may
heaven
in
its
bounty
bless
and
preserve
*NL*
you
;
may
this
be
the
last
misfortune
that
you
will
ever
suffer
.
Live
,
*NL*
and
be
happy
,
and
make
others
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
returned
,
Elizabeth
said
,
``
You
know
not
,
my
dear
Victor
,
how
much
*NL*
I
am
relieved
,
now
that
I
trust
in
the
innocence
of
this
unfortunate
*NL*
girl
.
I
never
could
again
have
known
peace
,
if
I
had
been
deceived
in
my
*NL*
reliance
on
her
.
For
the
moment
that
I
did
believe
her
guilty
,
I
felt
an
*NL*
anguish
that
I
could
not
have
long
sustained
.
Now
my
heart
is
lightened
.
*NL*
The
innocent
suffers
;
but
she
whom
I
thought
amiable
and
good
has
not
*NL*
betrayed
the
trust
I
reposed
in
her
,
and
I
am
consoled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amiable
cousin
!
such
were
your
thoughts
,
mild
and
gentle
as
your
own
*NL*
dear
eyes
and
voice
.
But
I
--
I
was
a
wretch
,
and
none
ever
conceived
of
*NL*
the
misery
that
I
then
endured

CHAPTER
I.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
more
painful
to
the
human
mind
,
than
,
after
the
feelings
have
*NL*
been
worked
up
by
a
quick
succession
of
events
,
the
dead
calmness
of
*NL*
inaction
and
certainty
which
follows
,
and
deprives
the
soul
both
of
hope
*NL*
and
fear
.
Justine
died
;
she
rested
;
and
I
was
alive
.
The
blood
flowed
*NL*
freely
in
my
veins
,
but
a
weight
of
despair
and
remorse
pressed
on
my
*NL*
heart
,
which
nothing
could
remove
.
Sleep
fled
from
my
eyes
;
I
wandered
*NL*
like
an
evil
spirit
,
for
I
had
committed
deeds
of
mischief
beyond
*NL*
description
horrible
,
and
more
,
much
more
,
-LRB-
I
persuaded
myself
-RRB-
was
yet
*NL*
behind
.
Yet
my
heart
overflowed
with
kindness
,
and
the
love
of
virtue
.
I
*NL*
had
begun
life
with
benevolent
intentions
,
and
thirsted
for
the
moment
*NL*
when
I
should
put
them
in
practice
,
and
make
myself
useful
to
my
*NL*
fellow-beings
.
Now
all
was
blasted
:
instead
of
that
serenity
of
*NL*
conscience
,
which
allowed
me
to
look
back
upon
the
past
with
*NL*
self-satisfaction
,
and
from
thence
to
gather
promise
of
new
hopes
,
I
*NL*
was
seized
by
remorse
and
the
sense
of
guilt
,
which
hurried
me
away
to
*NL*
a
hell
of
intense
tortures
,
such
as
no
language
can
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
state
of
mind
preyed
upon
my
health
,
which
had
entirely
recovered
*NL*
from
the
first
shock
it
had
sustained
.
I
shunned
the
face
of
man
;
all
*NL*
sound
of
joy
or
complacency
was
torture
to
me
;
solitude
was
my
only
*NL*
consolation
--
deep
,
dark
,
death-like
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
observed
with
pain
the
alteration
perceptible
in
my
*NL*
disposition
and
habits
,
and
endeavoured
to
reason
with
me
on
the
folly
*NL*
of
giving
way
to
immoderate
grief
.
``
Do
you
think
,
Victor
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
that
I
do
not
suffer
also
?
No
one
could
love
a
child
more
than
I
loved
*NL*
your
brother
;
''
-LRB-
tears
came
into
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
-RRB-
;
``
but
is
it
not
a
*NL*
duty
to
the
survivors
,
that
we
should
refrain
from
augmenting
their
*NL*
unhappiness
by
an
appearance
of
immoderate
grief
?
It
is
also
a
duty
owed
*NL*
to
yourself
;
for
excessive
sorrow
prevents
improvement
or
enjoyment
,
or
*NL*
even
the
discharge
of
daily
usefulness
,
without
which
no
man
is
fit
for
*NL*
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
advice
,
although
good
,
was
totally
inapplicable
to
my
case
;
I
*NL*
should
have
been
the
first
to
hide
my
grief
,
and
console
my
friends
,
if
*NL*
remorse
had
not
mingled
its
bitterness
with
my
other
sensations
.
Now
I
*NL*
could
only
answer
my
father
with
a
look
of
despair
,
and
endeavour
to
*NL*
hide
myself
from
his
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
we
retired
to
our
house
at
Belrive
.
This
change
was
*NL*
particularly
agreeable
to
me
.
The
shutting
of
the
gates
regularly
at
ten
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
the
impossibility
of
remaining
on
the
lake
after
that
*NL*
hour
,
had
rendered
our
residence
within
the
walls
of
Geneva
very
irksome
*NL*
to
me
.
I
was
now
free
.
Often
,
after
the
rest
of
the
family
had
retired
*NL*
for
the
night
,
I
took
the
boat
,
and
passed
many
hours
upon
the
water
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
with
my
sails
set
,
I
was
carried
by
the
wind
;
and
sometimes
,
*NL*
after
rowing
into
the
middle
of
the
lake
,
I
left
the
boat
to
pursue
its
*NL*
own
course
,
and
gave
way
to
my
own
miserable
reflections
.
I
was
often
*NL*
tempted
,
when
all
was
at
peace
around
me
,
and
I
the
only
unquiet
thing
*NL*
that
wandered
restless
in
a
scene
so
beautiful
and
heavenly
,
if
I
except
*NL*
some
bat
,
or
the
frogs
,
whose
harsh
and
interrupted
croaking
was
heard
*NL*
only
when
I
approached
the
shore
--
often
,
I
say
,
I
was
tempted
to
plunge
*NL*
into
the
silent
lake
,
that
the
waters
might
close
over
me
and
my
*NL*
calamities
for
ever
.
But
I
was
restrained
,
when
I
thought
of
the
heroic
*NL*
and
suffering
Elizabeth
,
whom
I
tenderly
loved
,
and
whose
existence
was
*NL*
bound
up
in
mine
.
I
thought
also
of
my
father
,
and
surviving
brother
:
*NL*
should
I
by
my
base
desertion
leave
them
exposed
and
unprotected
to
the
*NL*
malice
of
the
fiend
whom
I
had
let
loose
among
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
moments
I
wept
bitterly
,
and
wished
that
peace
would
revisit
my
*NL*
mind
only
that
I
might
afford
them
consolation
and
happiness
.
But
that
*NL*
could
not
be
.
Remorse
extinguished
every
hope
.
I
had
been
the
author
of
*NL*
unalterable
evils
;
and
I
lived
in
daily
fear
,
lest
the
monster
whom
I
*NL*
had
created
should
perpetrate
some
new
wickedness
.
I
had
an
obscure
*NL*
feeling
that
all
was
not
over
,
and
that
he
would
still
commit
some
*NL*
signal
crime
,
which
by
its
enormity
should
almost
efface
the
*NL*
recollection
of
the
past
.
There
was
always
scope
for
fear
,
so
long
as
*NL*
any
thing
I
loved
remained
behind
.
My
abhorrence
of
this
fiend
can
not
be
*NL*
conceived
.
When
I
thought
of
him
,
I
gnashed
my
teeth
,
my
eyes
became
*NL*
inflamed
,
and
I
ardently
wished
to
extinguish
that
life
which
I
had
so
*NL*
thoughtlessly
bestowed
.
When
I
reflected
on
his
crimes
and
malice
,
my
*NL*
hatred
and
revenge
burst
all
bounds
of
moderation
.
I
would
have
made
a
*NL*
pilgrimage
to
the
highest
peak
of
the
Andes
,
could
I
,
when
there
,
have
*NL*
precipitated
him
to
their
base
.
I
wished
to
see
him
again
,
that
I
might
*NL*
wreak
the
utmost
extent
of
anger
on
his
head
,
and
avenge
the
deaths
of
*NL*
William
and
Justine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
house
was
the
house
of
mourning
.
My
father
's
health
was
deeply
*NL*
shaken
by
the
horror
of
the
recent
events
.
Elizabeth
was
sad
and
*NL*
desponding
;
she
no
longer
took
delight
in
her
ordinary
occupations
;
all
*NL*
pleasure
seemed
to
her
sacrilege
toward
the
dead
;
eternal
woe
and
tears
*NL*
she
then
thought
was
the
just
tribute
she
should
pay
to
innocence
so
*NL*
blasted
and
destroyed
.
She
was
no
longer
that
happy
creature
,
who
in
*NL*
earlier
youth
wandered
with
me
on
the
banks
of
the
lake
,
and
talked
with
*NL*
ecstacy
of
our
future
prospects
.
She
had
become
grave
,
and
often
*NL*
conversed
of
the
inconstancy
of
fortune
,
and
the
instability
of
human
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
reflect
,
my
dear
cousin
,
''
said
she
,
``
on
the
miserable
death
of
*NL*
Justine
Moritz
,
I
no
longer
see
the
world
and
its
works
as
they
before
*NL*
appeared
to
me
.
Before
,
I
looked
upon
the
accounts
of
vice
and
*NL*
injustice
,
that
I
read
in
books
or
heard
from
others
,
as
tales
of
*NL*
ancient
days
,
or
imaginary
evils
;
at
least
they
were
remote
,
and
more
*NL*
familiar
to
reason
than
to
the
imagination
;
but
now
misery
has
come
*NL*
home
,
and
men
appear
to
me
as
monsters
thirsting
for
each
other
's
blood
.
*NL*
Yet
I
am
certainly
unjust
.
Every
body
believed
that
poor
girl
to
be
*NL*
guilty
;
and
if
she
could
have
committed
the
crime
for
which
she
*NL*
suffered
,
assuredly
she
would
have
been
the
most
depraved
of
human
*NL*
creatures
.
For
the
sake
of
a
few
jewels
,
to
have
murdered
the
son
of
her
*NL*
benefactor
and
friend
,
a
child
whom
she
had
nursed
from
its
birth
,
and
*NL*
appeared
to
love
as
if
it
had
been
her
own
!
I
could
not
consent
to
the
*NL*
death
of
any
human
being
;
but
certainly
I
should
have
thought
such
a
*NL*
creature
unfit
to
remain
in
the
society
of
men
.
Yet
she
was
innocent
.
I
*NL*
know
,
I
feel
she
was
innocent
;
you
are
of
the
same
opinion
,
and
that
*NL*
confirms
me
.
Alas
!
Victor
,
when
falsehood
can
look
so
like
the
truth
,
*NL*
who
can
assure
themselves
of
certain
happiness
?
I
feel
as
if
I
were
*NL*
walking
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
,
towards
which
thousands
are
*NL*
crowding
,
and
endeavouring
to
plunge
me
into
the
abyss
.
William
and
*NL*
Justine
were
assassinated
,
and
the
murderer
escapes
;
he
walks
about
the
*NL*
world
free
,
and
perhaps
respected
.
But
even
if
I
were
condemned
to
*NL*
suffer
on
the
scaffold
for
the
same
crimes
,
I
would
not
change
places
*NL*
with
such
a
wretch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
listened
to
this
discourse
with
the
extremest
agony
.
I
,
not
in
deed
,
*NL*
but
in
effect
,
was
the
true
murderer
.
Elizabeth
read
my
anguish
in
my
*NL*
countenance
,
and
kindly
taking
my
hand
said
,
``
My
dearest
cousin
,
you
*NL*
must
calm
yourself
.
These
events
have
affected
me
,
God
knows
how
deeply
;
*NL*
but
I
am
not
so
wretched
as
you
are
.
There
is
an
expression
of
despair
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
of
revenge
,
in
your
countenance
,
that
makes
me
tremble
.
Be
*NL*
calm
,
my
dear
Victor
;
I
would
sacrifice
my
life
to
your
peace
.
We
surely
*NL*
shall
be
happy
:
quiet
in
our
native
country
,
and
not
mingling
in
the
*NL*
world
,
what
can
disturb
our
tranquillity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shed
tears
as
she
said
this
,
distrusting
the
very
solace
that
she
*NL*
gave
;
but
at
the
same
time
she
smiled
,
that
she
might
chase
away
the
*NL*
fiend
that
lurked
in
my
heart
.
My
father
,
who
saw
in
the
unhappiness
*NL*
that
was
painted
in
my
face
only
an
exaggeration
of
that
sorrow
which
I
*NL*
might
naturally
feel
,
thought
that
an
amusement
suited
to
my
taste
would
*NL*
be
the
best
means
of
restoring
to
me
my
wonted
serenity
.
It
was
from
*NL*
this
cause
that
he
had
removed
to
the
country
;
and
,
induced
by
the
same
*NL*
motive
,
he
now
proposed
that
we
should
all
make
an
excursion
to
the
*NL*
valley
of
Chamounix
.
I
had
been
there
before
,
but
Elizabeth
and
Ernest
*NL*
never
had
;
and
both
had
often
expressed
an
earnest
desire
to
see
the
*NL*
scenery
of
this
place
,
which
had
been
described
to
them
as
so
wonderful
*NL*
and
sublime
.
Accordingly
we
departed
from
Geneva
on
this
tour
about
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
month
of
August
,
nearly
two
months
after
the
death
of
*NL*
Justine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
weather
was
uncommonly
fine
;
and
if
mine
had
been
a
sorrow
to
be
*NL*
chased
away
by
any
fleeting
circumstance
,
this
excursion
would
certainly
*NL*
have
had
the
effect
intended
by
my
father
.
As
it
was
,
I
was
somewhat
*NL*
interested
in
the
scene
;
it
sometimes
lulled
,
although
it
could
not
*NL*
extinguish
my
grief
.
During
the
first
day
we
travelled
in
a
carriage
.
In
*NL*
the
morning
we
had
seen
the
mountains
at
a
distance
,
towards
which
we
*NL*
gradually
advanced
.
We
perceived
that
the
valley
through
which
we
wound
,
*NL*
and
which
was
formed
by
the
river
Arve
,
whose
course
we
followed
,
closed
*NL*
in
upon
us
by
degrees
;
and
when
the
sun
had
set
,
we
beheld
immense
*NL*
mountains
and
precipices
overhanging
us
on
every
side
,
and
heard
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
river
raging
among
rocks
,
and
the
dashing
of
water-falls
*NL*
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
we
pursued
our
journey
upon
mules
;
and
as
we
ascended
still
*NL*
higher
,
the
valley
assumed
a
more
magnificent
and
astonishing
character
.
*NL*
Ruined
castles
hanging
on
the
precipices
of
piny
mountains
;
the
*NL*
impetuous
Arve
,
and
cottages
every
here
and
there
peeping
forth
from
*NL*
among
the
trees
,
formed
a
scene
of
singular
beauty
.
But
it
was
augmented
*NL*
and
rendered
sublime
by
the
mighty
Alps
,
whose
white
and
shining
*NL*
pyramids
and
domes
towered
above
all
,
as
belonging
to
another
earth
,
the
*NL*
habitations
of
another
race
of
beings
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
passed
the
bridge
of
Pelissier
,
where
the
ravine
,
which
the
river
*NL*
forms
,
opened
before
us
,
and
we
began
to
ascend
the
mountain
that
*NL*
overhangs
it
.
Soon
after
we
entered
the
valley
of
Chamounix
.
This
valley
*NL*
is
more
wonderful
and
sublime
,
but
not
so
beautiful
and
picturesque
as
*NL*
that
of
Servox
,
through
which
we
had
just
passed
.
The
high
and
snowy
*NL*
mountains
were
its
immediate
boundaries
;
but
we
saw
no
more
ruined
*NL*
castles
and
fertile
fields
.
Immense
glaciers
approached
the
road
;
we
*NL*
heard
the
rumbling
thunder
of
the
falling
avalanche
,
and
marked
the
*NL*
smoke
of
its
passage
.
Mont
Blanc
,
the
supreme
and
magnificent
Mont
*NL*
Blanc
,
raised
itself
from
the
surrounding
_
aiguilles
_
,
and
its
*NL*
tremendous
_
dome
_
overlooked
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
journey
,
I
sometimes
joined
Elizabeth
,
and
exerted
myself
to
*NL*
point
out
to
her
the
various
beauties
of
the
scene
.
I
often
suffered
my
*NL*
mule
to
lag
behind
,
and
indulged
in
the
misery
of
reflection
.
At
other
*NL*
times
I
spurred
on
the
animal
before
my
companions
,
that
I
might
forget
*NL*
them
,
the
world
,
and
,
more
than
all
,
myself
.
When
at
a
distance
,
I
*NL*
alighted
,
and
threw
myself
on
the
grass
,
weighed
down
by
horror
and
*NL*
despair
.
At
eight
in
the
evening
I
arrived
at
Chamounix
.
My
father
and
*NL*
Elizabeth
were
very
much
fatigued
;
Ernest
,
who
accompanied
us
,
was
*NL*
delighted
,
and
in
high
spirits
:
the
only
circumstance
that
detracted
*NL*
from
his
pleasure
was
the
south
wind
,
and
the
rain
it
seemed
to
promise
*NL*
for
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
retired
early
to
our
apartments
,
but
not
to
sleep
;
at
least
I
did
*NL*
not
.
I
remained
many
hours
at
the
window
,
watching
the
pallid
lightning
*NL*
that
played
above
Mont
Blanc
,
and
listening
to
the
rushing
of
the
Arve
,
*NL*
which
ran
below
my
window
.

CHAPTER
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
contrary
to
the
prognostications
of
our
guides
,
was
fine
,
*NL*
although
clouded
.
We
visited
the
source
of
the
Arveiron
,
and
rode
about
*NL*
the
valley
until
evening
.
These
sublime
and
magnificent
scenes
afforded
*NL*
me
the
greatest
consolation
that
I
was
capable
of
receiving
.
They
*NL*
elevated
me
from
all
littleness
of
feeling
;
and
although
they
did
not
*NL*
remove
my
grief
,
they
subdued
and
tranquillized
it
.
In
some
degree
,
*NL*
also
,
they
diverted
my
mind
from
the
thoughts
over
which
it
had
brooded
*NL*
for
the
last
month
.
I
returned
in
the
evening
,
fatigued
,
but
less
*NL*
unhappy
,
and
conversed
with
my
family
with
more
cheerfulness
than
had
*NL*
been
my
custom
for
some
time
.
My
father
was
pleased
,
and
Elizabeth
*NL*
overjoyed
.
``
My
dear
cousin
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
see
what
happiness
you
*NL*
diffuse
when
you
are
happy
;
do
not
relapse
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
the
rain
poured
down
in
torrents
,
and
thick
mists
*NL*
hid
the
summits
of
the
mountains
.
I
rose
early
,
but
felt
unusually
*NL*
melancholy
.
The
rain
depressed
me
;
my
old
feelings
recurred
,
and
I
was
*NL*
miserable
.
I
knew
how
disappointed
my
father
would
be
at
this
sudden
*NL*
change
,
and
I
wished
to
avoid
him
until
I
had
recovered
myself
so
far
as
*NL*
to
be
enabled
to
conceal
those
feelings
that
overpowered
me
.
I
knew
*NL*
that
they
would
remain
that
day
at
the
inn
;
and
as
I
had
ever
inured
*NL*
myself
to
rain
,
moisture
,
and
cold
,
I
resolved
to
go
alone
to
the
summit
*NL*
of
Montanvert
.
I
remembered
the
effect
that
the
view
of
the
tremendous
*NL*
and
ever-moving
glacier
had
produced
upon
my
mind
when
I
first
saw
it
.
*NL*
It
had
then
filled
me
with
a
sublime
ecstacy
that
gave
wings
to
the
*NL*
soul
,
and
allowed
it
to
soar
from
the
obscure
world
to
light
and
joy
.
*NL*
The
sight
of
the
awful
and
majestic
in
nature
had
indeed
always
the
*NL*
effect
of
solemnizing
my
mind
,
and
causing
me
to
forget
the
passing
*NL*
cares
of
life
.
I
determined
to
go
alone
,
for
I
was
well
acquainted
with
*NL*
the
path
,
and
the
presence
of
another
would
destroy
the
solitary
*NL*
grandeur
of
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ascent
is
precipitous
,
but
the
path
is
cut
into
continual
and
short
*NL*
windings
,
which
enable
you
to
surmount
the
perpendicularity
of
the
*NL*
mountain
.
It
is
a
scene
terrifically
desolate
.
In
a
thousand
spots
the
*NL*
traces
of
the
winter
avalanche
may
be
perceived
,
where
trees
lie
broken
*NL*
and
strewed
on
the
ground
;
some
entirely
destroyed
,
others
bent
,
leaning
*NL*
upon
the
jutting
rocks
of
the
mountain
,
or
transversely
upon
other
*NL*
trees
.
The
path
,
as
you
ascend
higher
,
is
intersected
by
ravines
of
*NL*
snow
,
down
which
stones
continually
roll
from
above
;
one
of
them
is
*NL*
particularly
dangerous
,
as
the
slightest
sound
,
such
as
even
speaking
in
*NL*
a
loud
voice
,
produces
a
concussion
of
air
sufficient
to
draw
*NL*
destruction
upon
the
head
of
the
speaker
.
The
pines
are
not
tall
or
*NL*
luxuriant
,
but
they
are
sombre
,
and
add
an
air
of
severity
to
the
scene
.
*NL*
I
looked
on
the
valley
beneath
;
vast
mists
were
rising
from
the
rivers
*NL*
which
ran
through
it
,
and
curling
in
thick
wreaths
around
the
opposite
*NL*
mountains
,
whose
summits
were
hid
in
the
uniform
clouds
,
while
rain
*NL*
poured
from
the
dark
sky
,
and
added
to
the
melancholy
impression
I
*NL*
received
from
the
objects
around
me
.
Alas
!
why
does
man
boast
of
*NL*
sensibilities
superior
to
those
apparent
in
the
brute
;
it
only
renders
*NL*
them
more
necessary
beings
.
If
our
impulses
were
confined
to
hunger
,
*NL*
thirst
,
and
desire
,
we
might
be
nearly
free
;
but
now
we
are
moved
by
*NL*
every
wind
that
blows
,
and
a
chance
word
or
scene
that
that
word
may
*NL*
convey
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
rest
;
a
dream
has
power
to
poison
sleep
.
*NL*
We
rise
;
one
wand
`
ring
thought
pollutes
the
day
.
*NL*
We
feel
,
conceive
,
or
reason
;
laugh
,
or
weep
,
*NL*
Embrace
fond
woe
,
or
cast
our
cares
away
;
*NL*
It
is
the
same
:
for
,
be
it
joy
or
sorrow
,
*NL*
The
path
of
its
departure
still
is
free
.
*NL*
Man
's
yesterday
may
ne'er
be
like
his
morrow
;
*NL*
Nought
may
endure
but
mutability
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
noon
when
I
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
ascent
.
For
some
*NL*
time
I
sat
upon
the
rock
that
overlooks
the
sea
of
ice
.
A
mist
covered
*NL*
both
that
and
the
surrounding
mountains
.
Presently
a
breeze
dissipated
*NL*
the
cloud
,
and
I
descended
upon
the
glacier
.
The
surface
is
very
uneven
,
*NL*
rising
like
the
waves
of
a
troubled
sea
,
descending
low
,
and
*NL*
interspersed
by
rifts
that
sink
deep
.
The
field
of
ice
is
almost
a
*NL*
league
in
width
,
but
I
spent
nearly
two
hours
in
crossing
it
.
The
*NL*
opposite
mountain
is
a
bare
perpendicular
rock
.
From
the
side
where
I
*NL*
now
stood
Montanvert
was
exactly
opposite
,
at
the
distance
of
a
league
;
*NL*
and
above
it
rose
Mont
Blanc
,
in
awful
majesty
.
I
remained
in
a
recess
*NL*
of
the
rock
,
gazing
on
this
wonderful
and
stupendous
scene
.
The
sea
,
or
*NL*
rather
the
vast
river
of
ice
,
wound
among
its
dependent
mountains
,
whose
*NL*
aerial
summits
hung
over
its
recesses
.
Their
icy
and
glittering
peaks
*NL*
shone
in
the
sunlight
over
the
clouds
.
My
heart
,
which
was
before
*NL*
sorrowful
,
now
swelled
with
something
like
joy
;
I
exclaimed
--
``
Wandering
*NL*
spirits
,
if
indeed
ye
wander
,
and
do
not
rest
in
your
narrow
beds
,
allow
*NL*
me
this
faint
happiness
,
or
take
me
,
as
your
companion
,
away
from
the
*NL*
joys
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
said
this
,
I
suddenly
beheld
the
figure
of
a
man
,
at
some
distance
,
*NL*
advancing
towards
me
with
superhuman
speed
.
He
bounded
over
the
crevices
*NL*
in
the
ice
,
among
which
I
had
walked
with
caution
;
his
stature
also
,
as
*NL*
he
approached
,
seemed
to
exceed
that
of
man
.
I
was
troubled
:
a
mist
came
*NL*
over
my
eyes
,
and
I
felt
a
faintness
seize
me
;
but
I
was
quickly
*NL*
restored
by
the
cold
gale
of
the
mountains
.
I
perceived
,
as
the
shape
*NL*
came
nearer
,
-LRB-
sight
tremendous
and
abhorred
!
-RRB-
that
it
was
the
wretch
*NL*
whom
I
had
created
.
I
trembled
with
rage
and
horror
,
resolving
to
wait
*NL*
his
approach
,
and
then
close
with
him
in
mortal
combat
.
He
approached
;
*NL*
his
countenance
bespoke
bitter
anguish
,
combined
with
disdain
and
*NL*
malignity
,
while
its
unearthly
ugliness
rendered
it
almost
too
horrible
*NL*
for
human
eyes
.
But
I
scarcely
observed
this
;
anger
and
hatred
had
at
*NL*
first
deprived
me
of
utterance
,
and
I
recovered
only
to
overwhelm
him
*NL*
with
words
expressive
of
furious
detestation
and
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
``
do
you
dare
approach
me
?
and
do
not
you
fear
the
*NL*
fierce
vengeance
of
my
arm
wreaked
on
your
miserable
head
?
Begone
,
vile
*NL*
insect
!
or
rather
stay
,
that
I
may
trample
you
to
dust
!
and
,
oh
,
that
I
*NL*
could
,
with
the
extinction
of
your
miserable
existence
,
restore
those
*NL*
victims
whom
you
have
so
diabolically
murdered
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
this
reception
,
''
said
the
daemon
.
``
All
men
hate
the
wretched
;
*NL*
how
then
must
I
be
hated
,
who
am
miserable
beyond
all
living
things
!
Yet
*NL*
you
,
my
creator
,
detest
and
spurn
me
,
thy
creature
,
to
whom
thou
art
*NL*
bound
by
ties
only
dissoluble
by
the
annihilation
of
one
of
us
.
You
*NL*
purpose
to
kill
me
.
How
dare
you
sport
thus
with
life
?
Do
your
duty
*NL*
towards
me
,
and
I
will
do
mine
towards
you
and
the
rest
of
mankind
.
If
*NL*
you
will
comply
with
my
conditions
,
I
will
leave
them
and
you
at
peace
;
*NL*
but
if
you
refuse
,
I
will
glut
the
maw
of
death
,
until
it
be
satiated
*NL*
with
the
blood
of
your
remaining
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Abhorred
monster
!
fiend
that
thou
art
!
the
tortures
of
hell
are
too
*NL*
mild
a
vengeance
for
thy
crimes
.
Wretched
devil
!
you
reproach
me
with
*NL*
your
creation
;
come
on
then
,
that
I
may
extinguish
the
spark
which
I
so
*NL*
negligently
bestowed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
rage
was
without
bounds
;
I
sprang
on
him
,
impelled
by
all
the
*NL*
feelings
which
can
arm
one
being
against
the
existence
of
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
easily
eluded
me
,
and
said
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
calm
!
I
entreat
you
to
hear
me
,
before
you
give
vent
to
your
hatred
*NL*
on
my
devoted
head
.
Have
I
not
suffered
enough
,
that
you
seek
to
*NL*
increase
my
misery
?
Life
,
although
it
may
only
be
an
accumulation
of
*NL*
anguish
,
is
dear
to
me
,
and
I
will
defend
it
.
Remember
,
thou
hast
made
*NL*
me
more
powerful

set
myself

I
will
be
even
mild

docile

thou

even
thy

affection
,
is
most
due

Remember
,
that
I
am
thy
creature

I
ought

be

thy
Adam

I
am
rather
the

for
no
misdeed

Every
where
I
see
bliss

from

*NL*
irrevocably
excluded

I
was
benevolent

good

made
me

I
shall
again
be
virtuous

Believe

I
was
benevolent

glowed
with

I
gather
from
your
fellow-creatures

owe
me
*NL*
nothing

they
spurn
and
hate
me

The
desert

I
have
wandered
here
many

the
caves

ice

do
not

not

These
bleak

hail

If
the

mankind
knew

they
would
do

you
do

arm
themselves

keep
no

I
am
miserable

Yet
it

Listen

bloody

Listen

accuse

placed

I
flung
from

violence

the

high
in

hide
itself
behind
yon
snowy
precipices

illuminate
another

will
have
heard
my
story

can
decide
.
On
you
it
rests
,
whether
I
*NL*
quit
for
ever
the
neighbourhood
of
man
,
and
lead
a
harmless
life
,

become

scourge

the
author
of
your
own
*NL*
speedy
ruin

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
,
he
led
the
way
across
the
ice
:
I
followed
.
My
heart
was
*NL*
full
,
and
I
did
not
answer
him
;
but
,
as
I
proceeded
,
I
weighed
the
*NL*
various
arguments
that
he
had
used
,
and
determined
at
least
to
listen
to
*NL*
his
tale
.
I
was
partly
urged
by
curiosity
,
and
compassion
confirmed
my
*NL*
resolution
.
I
had
hitherto
supposed
him
to
be
the
murderer
of
my
*NL*
brother
,
and
I
eagerly
sought
a
confirmation
or
denial
of
this
opinion
.
*NL*
For
the
first
time
,
also
,
I
felt
what
the
duties
of
a
creator
towards
*NL*
his
creature
were
,
and
that
I
ought
to
render
him
happy
before
I
*NL*
complained
of
his
wickedness
.
These
motives
urged
me
to
comply
with
his
*NL*
demand
.
We
crossed
the
ice
,
therefore
,
and
ascended
the
opposite
rock
.
*NL*
The
air
was
cold
,
and
the
rain
again
began
to
descend
:
we
entered
the
*NL*
hut
,
the
fiend
with
an
air
of
exultation
,
I
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
*NL*
depressed
spirits
.
But
I
consented
to
listen
;
and
,
seating
myself
by
the
*NL*
fire
which
my
odious
companion
had
lighted
,
he
thus
began
his
tale
.

CHAPTER
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
with
considerable
difficulty
that
I
remember
the
original
aera
of
*NL*
my
being
:
all
the
events
of
that
period
appear
confused
and
indistinct
.
*NL*
A
strange
multiplicity
of
sensations
seized
me
,
and
I
saw
,
felt
,
heard
,
*NL*
and
smelt
,
at
the
same
time
;
and
it
was
,
indeed
,
a
long
time
before
I
*NL*
learned
to
distinguish
between
the
operations
of
my
various
senses
.
By
*NL*
degrees
,
I
remember
,
a
stronger
light
pressed
upon
my
nerves
,
so
that
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
shut
my
eyes
.
Darkness
then
came
over
me
,
and
troubled
*NL*
me
;
but
hardly
had
I
felt
this
,
when
,
by
opening
my
eyes
,
as
I
now
*NL*
suppose
,
the
light
poured
in
upon
me
again
.
I
walked
,
and
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
descended
;
but
I
presently
found
a
great
alteration
in
my
sensations
.
*NL*
Before
,
dark
and
opaque
bodies
had
surrounded
me
,
impervious
to
my
touch
*NL*
or
sight
;
but
I
now
found
that
I
could
wander
on
at
liberty
,
with
no
*NL*
obstacles
which
I
could
not
either
surmount
or
avoid
.
The
light
became
*NL*
more
and
more
oppressive
to
me
;
and
,
the
heat
wearying
me
as
I
walked
,
I
*NL*
sought
a
place
where
I
could
receive
shade
.
This
was
the
forest
near
*NL*
Ingolstadt
;
and
here
I
lay
by
the
side
of
a
brook
resting
from
my
*NL*
fatigue
,
until
I
felt
tormented
by
hunger
and
thirst
.
This
roused
me
*NL*
from
my
nearly
dormant
state
,
and
I
ate
some
berries
which
I
found
*NL*
hanging
on
the
trees
,
or
lying
on
the
ground
.
I
slaked
my
thirst
at
the
*NL*
brook
;
and
then
lying
down
,
was
overcome
by
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
dark
when
I
awoke
;
I
felt
cold
also
,
and
half-frightened
as
it
*NL*
were
instinctively
,
finding
myself
so
desolate
.
Before
I
had
quitted
*NL*
your
apartment
,
on
a
sensation
of
cold
,
I
had
covered
myself
with
some
*NL*
clothes
;
but
these
were
insufficient
to
secure
me
from
the
dews
of
*NL*
night
.
I
was
a
poor
,
helpless
,
miserable
wretch
;
I
knew
,
and
could
*NL*
distinguish
,
nothing
;
but
,
feeling
pain
invade
me
on
all
sides
,
I
sat
*NL*
down
and
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
a
gentle
light
stole
over
the
heavens
,
and
gave
me
a
sensation
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
I
started
up
,
and
beheld
a
radiant
form
rise
from
among
the
*NL*
trees
.
I
gazed
with
a
kind
of
wonder
.
It
moved
slowly
,
but
it
*NL*
enlightened
my
path
;
and
I
again
went
out
in
search
of
berries
.
I
was
*NL*
still
cold
,
when
under
one
of
the
trees
I
found
a
huge
cloak
,
with
which
*NL*
I
covered
myself
,
and
sat
down
upon
the
ground
.
No
distinct
ideas
*NL*
occupied
my
mind
;
all
was
confused
.
I
felt
light
,
and
hunger
,
and
*NL*
thirst
,
and
darkness
;
innumerable
sounds
rung
in
my
ears
,
and
on
all
*NL*
sides
various
scents
saluted
me
:
the
only
object
that
I
could
*NL*
distinguish
was
the
bright
moon
,
and
I
fixed
my
eyes
on
that
with
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Several
changes
of
day
and
night
passed
,
and
the
orb
of
night
had
*NL*
greatly
lessened
when
I
began
to
distinguish
my
sensations
from
each
*NL*
other
.
I
gradually
saw
plainly
the
clear
stream
that
supplied
me
with
*NL*
drink
,
and
the
trees
that
shaded
me
with
their
foliage
.
I
was
delighted
*NL*
when
I
first
discovered
that
a
pleasant
sound
,
which
often
saluted
my
*NL*
ears
,
proceeded
from
the
throats
of
the
little
winged
animals
who
had
*NL*
often
intercepted
the
light
from
my
eyes
.
I
began
also
to
observe
,
with
*NL*
greater
accuracy
,
the
forms
that
surrounded
me
,
and
to
perceive
the
*NL*
boundaries
of
the
radiant
roof
of
light
which
canopied
me
.
Sometimes
I
*NL*
tried
to
imitate
the
pleasant
songs
of
the
birds
,
but
was
unable
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
wished
to
express
my
sensations
in
my
own
mode
,
but
the
*NL*
uncouth
and
inarticulate
sounds
which
broke
from
me
frightened
me
into
*NL*
silence
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
moon
had
disappeared
from
the
night
,
and
again
,
with
a
lessened
*NL*
form
,
shewed
itself
,
while
I
still
remained
in
the
forest
.
My
sensations
*NL*
had
,
by
this
time
,
become
distinct
,
and
my
mind
received
every
day
*NL*
additional
ideas
.
My
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
light
,
and
to
*NL*
perceive
objects
in
their
right
forms
;
I
distinguished
the
insect
from
*NL*
the
herb
,
and
,
by
degrees
,
one
herb
from
another
.
I
found
that
the
*NL*
sparrow
uttered
none
but
harsh
notes
,
whilst
those
of
the
blackbird
and
*NL*
thrush
were
sweet
and
enticing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
,
when
I
was
oppressed
by
cold
,
I
found
a
fire
which
had
been
*NL*
left
by
some
wandering
beggars
,
and
was
overcome
with
delight
at
the
*NL*
warmth
I
experienced
from
it
.
In
my
joy
I
thrust
my
hand
into
the
live
*NL*
embers
,
but
quickly
drew
it
out
again
with
a
cry
of
pain
.
How
strange
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
that
the
same
cause
should
produce
such
opposite
effects
!
I
*NL*
examined
the
materials
of
the
fire
,
and
to
my
joy
found
it
to
be
*NL*
composed
of
wood
.
I
quickly
collected
some
branches
;
but
they
were
wet
,
*NL*
and
would
not
burn
.
I
was
pained
at
this
,
and
sat
still
watching
the
*NL*
operation
of
the
fire
.
The
wet
wood
which
I
had
placed
near
the
heat
*NL*
dried
,
and
itself
became
inflamed
.
I
reflected
on
this
;
and
,
by
touching
*NL*
the
various
branches
,
I
discovered
the
cause
,
and
busied
myself
in
*NL*
collecting
a
great
quantity
of
wood
,
that
I
might
dry
it
,
and
have
a
*NL*
plentiful
supply
of
fire
.
When
night
came
on
,
and
brought
sleep
with
it
,
*NL*
I
was
in
the
greatest
fear
lest
my
fire
should
be
extinguished
.
I
*NL*
covered
it
carefully
with
dry
wood
and
leaves
,
and
placed
wet
branches
*NL*
upon
it
;
and
then
,
spreading
my
cloak
,
I
lay
on
the
ground
,
and
sunk
*NL*
into
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
morning
when
I
awoke
,
and
my
first
care
was
to
visit
the
fire
.
I
*NL*
uncovered
it
,
and
a
gentle
breeze
quickly
fanned
it
into
a
flame
.
I
*NL*
observed
this
also
,
and
contrived
a
fan
of
branches
,
which
roused
the
*NL*
embers
when
they
were
nearly
extinguished
.
When
night
came
again
,
I
*NL*
found
,
with
pleasure
,
that
the
fire
gave
light
as
well
as
heat
;
and
that
*NL*
the
discovery
of
this
element
was
useful
to
me
in
my
food
;
for
I
found
*NL*
some
of
the
offals
that
the
travellers
had
left
had
been
roasted
,
and
*NL*
tasted
much
more
savoury
than
the
berries
I
gathered
from
the
trees
.
I
*NL*
tried
,
therefore
,
to
dress
my
food
in
the
same
manner
,
placing
it
on
the
*NL*
live
embers
.
I
found
that
the
berries
were
spoiled
by
this
operation
,
*NL*
and
the
nuts
and
roots
much
improved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Food
,
however
,
became
scarce
;
and
I
often
spent
the
whole
day
searching
*NL*
in
vain
for
a
few
acorns
to
assuage
the
pangs
of
hunger
.
When
I
found
*NL*
this
,
I
resolved
to
quit
the
place
that
I
had
hitherto
inhabited
,
to
*NL*
seek
for
one
where
the
few
wants
I
experienced
would
be
more
easily
*NL*
satisfied
.
In
this
emigration
,
I
exceedingly
lamented
the
loss
of
the
*NL*
fire
which
I
had
obtained
through
accident
,
and
knew
not
how
to
*NL*
re-produce
it
.
I
gave
several
hours
to
the
serious
consideration
of
*NL*
this
difficulty
;
but
I
was
obliged
to
relinquish
all
attempt
to
supply
*NL*
it
;
and
,
wrapping
myself
up
in
my
cloak
,
I
struck
across
the
wood
*NL*
towards
the
setting
sun
.
I
passed
three
days
in
these
rambles
,
and
at
*NL*
length
discovered
the
open
country
.
A
great
fall
of
snow
had
taken
place
*NL*
the
night
before
,
and
the
fields
were
of
one
uniform
white
;
the
*NL*
appearance
was
disconsolate
,
and
I
found
my
feet
chilled
by
the
cold
*NL*
damp
substance
that
covered
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
about
seven
in
the
morning
,
and
I
longed
to
obtain
food
and
*NL*
shelter
;
at
length
I
perceived
a
small
hut
,
on
a
rising
ground
,
which
*NL*
had
doubtless
been
built
for
the
convenience
of
some
shepherd
.
This
was
*NL*
a
new
sight
to
me
;
and
I
examined
the
structure
with
great
curiosity
.
*NL*
Finding
the
door
open
,
I
entered
.
An
old
man
sat
in
it
,
near
a
fire
,
*NL*
over
which
he
was
preparing
his
breakfast
.
He
turned
on
hearing
a
noise
;
*NL*
and
,
perceiving
me
,
shrieked
loudly
,
and
,
quitting
the
hut
,
ran
across
*NL*
the
fields
with
a
speed
of
which
his
debilitated
form
hardly
appeared
*NL*
capable
.
His
appearance
,
different
from
any
I
had
ever
before
seen
,
and
*NL*
his
flight
,
somewhat
surprised
me
.
But
I
was
enchanted
by
the
appearance
*NL*
of
the
hut
:
here
the
snow
and
rain
could
not
penetrate
;
the
ground
was
*NL*
dry
;
and
it
presented
to
me
then
as
exquisite
and
divine
a
retreat
as
*NL*
Pandaemonium
appeared
to
the
daemons
of
hell
after
their
sufferings
in
the
*NL*
lake
of
fire
.
I
greedily
devoured
the
remnants
of
the
shepherd
's
*NL*
breakfast
,
which
consisted
of
bread
,
cheese
,
milk
,
and
wine
;
the
*NL*
latter
,
however
,
I
did
not
like
.
Then
overcome
by
fatigue
,
I
lay
down
*NL*
among
some
straw
,
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
noon
when
I
awoke
;
and
,
allured
by
the
warmth
of
the
sun
,
which
*NL*
shone
brightly
on
the
white
ground
,
I
determined
to
recommence
my
*NL*
travels
;
and
,
depositing
the
remains
of
the
peasant
's
breakfast
in
a
*NL*
wallet
I
found
,
I
proceeded
across
the
fields
for
several
hours
,
until
*NL*
at
sunset
I
arrived
at
a
village
.
How
miraculous
did
this
appear
!
the
*NL*
huts
,
the
neater
cottages
,
and
stately
houses
,
engaged
my
admiration
by
*NL*
turns
.
The
vegetables
in
the
gardens
,
the
milk
and
cheese
that
I
saw
*NL*
placed
at
the
windows
of
some
of
the
cottages
,
allured
my
appetite
.
One
*NL*
of
the
best
of
these
I
entered
;
but
I
had
hardly
placed
my
foot
within
*NL*
the
door
,
before
the
children
shrieked
,
and
one
of
the
women
fainted
.
*NL*
The
whole
village
was
roused
;
some
fled
,
some
attacked
me
,
until
,
*NL*
grievously
bruised
by
stones
and
many
other
kinds
of
missile
weapons
,
I
*NL*
escaped
to
the
open
country
,
and
fearfully
took
refuge
in
a
low
hovel
,
*NL*
quite
bare
,
and
making
a
wretched
appearance
after
the
palaces
I
had
*NL*
beheld
in
the
village
.
This
hovel
,
however
,
joined
a
cottage
of
a
neat
*NL*
and
pleasant
appearance
;
but
,
after
my
late
dearly-bought
experience
,
I
*NL*
dared
not
enter
it
.
My
place
of
refuge
was
constructed
of
wood
,
but
so
*NL*
low
,
that
I
could
with
difficulty
sit
upright
in
it
.
No
wood
,
however
,
*NL*
was
placed
on
the
earth
,
which
formed
the
floor
,
but
it
was
dry
;
and
*NL*
although
the
wind
entered
it
by
innumerable
chinks
,
I
found
it
an
*NL*
agreeable
asylum
from
the
snow
and
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
then
I
retreated
,
and
lay
down
,
happy
to
have
found
a
shelter
,
*NL*
however
miserable
,
from
the
inclemency
of
the
season
,
and
still
more
*NL*
from
the
barbarity
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
morning
dawned
,
I
crept
from
my
kennel
,
that
I
might
view
*NL*
the
adjacent
cottage
,
and
discover
if
I
could
remain
in
the
habitation
I
*NL*
had
found
.
It
was
situated
against
,
the
back
of
the
cottage
,
and
*NL*
surrounded
on
the
sides
which
were
exposed
by
a
pig-stye
and
a
clear
*NL*
pool
of
water
.
One
part
was
open
,
and
by
that
I
had
crept
in
;
but
now
I
*NL*
covered
every
crevice
by
which
I
might
be
perceived
with
stones
and
*NL*
wood
,
yet
in
such
a
manner
that
I
might
move
them
on
occasion
to
pass
*NL*
out
:
all
the
light
I
enjoyed
came
through
the
stye
,
and
that
was
*NL*
sufficient
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
thus
arranged
my
dwelling
,
and
carpeted
it
with
clean
straw
,
I
*NL*
retired
;
for
I
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
at
a
distance
,
and
I
remembered
*NL*
too
well
my
treatment
the
night
before
,
to
trust
myself
in
his
power
.
I
*NL*
had
first
,
however
,
provided
for
my
sustenance
for
that
day
,
by
a
loaf
*NL*
of
coarse
bread
,
which
I
purloined
,
and
a
cup
with
which
I
could
drink
,
*NL*
more
conveniently
than
from
my
hand
,
of
the
pure
water
which
flowed
by
*NL*
my
retreat
.
The
floor
was
a
little
raised
,
so
that
it
was
kept
perfectly
*NL*
dry
,
and
by
its
vicinity
to
the
chimney
of
the
cottage
it
was
tolerably
*NL*
warm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
thus
provided
,
I
resolved
to
reside
in
this
hovel
,
until
*NL*
something
should
occur
which
might
alter
my
determination
.
It
was
indeed
*NL*
a
paradise
,
compared
to
the
bleak
forest
,
my
former
residence
,
the
*NL*
rain-dropping
branches
,
and
dank
earth
.
I
ate
my
breakfast
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
was
about
to
remove
a
plank
to
procure
myself
a
little
*NL*
water
,
when
I
heard
a
step
,
and
,
looking
through
a
small
chink
,
I
beheld
*NL*
a
young
creature
,
with
a
pail
on
her
head
,
passing
before
my
hovel
.
The
*NL*
girl
was
young
and
of
gentle
demeanour
,
unlike
what
I
have
since
found
*NL*
cottagers
and
farm-house
servants
to
be
.
Yet
she
was
meanly
dressed
,
a
*NL*
coarse
blue
petticoat
and
a
linen
jacket
being
her
only
garb
;
her
fair
*NL*
hair
was
plaited
,
but
not
adorned
;
she
looked
patient
,
yet
sad
.
I
lost
*NL*
sight
of
her
;
and
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
returned
,
bearing
*NL*
the
pail
,
which
was
now
partly
filled
with
milk
.
As
she
walked
along
,
*NL*
seemingly
incommoded
by
the
burden
,
a
young
man
met
her
,
whose
*NL*
countenance
expressed
a
deeper
despondence
.
Uttering
a
few
sounds
with
*NL*
an
air
of
melancholy
,
he
took
the
pail
from
her
head
,
and
bore
it
to
the
*NL*
cottage
himself
.
She
followed
,
and
they
disappeared
.
Presently
I
saw
the
*NL*
young
man
again
,
with
some
tools
in
his
hand
,
cross
the
field
behind
the
*NL*
cottage
;
and
the
girl
was
also
busied
,
sometimes
in
the
house
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
in
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
examining
my
dwelling
,
I
found
that
one
of
the
windows
of
the
*NL*
cottage
had
formerly
occupied
a
part
of
it
,
but
the
panes
had
been
*NL*
filled
up
with
wood
.
In
one
of
these
was
a
small
and
almost
*NL*
imperceptible
chink
,
through
which
the
eye
could
just
penetrate
.
Through
*NL*
this
crevice
,
a
small
room
was
visible
,
white-washed
and
clean
,
but
very
*NL*
bare
of
furniture
.
In
one
corner
,
near
a
small
fire
,
sat
an
old
man
,
*NL*
leaning
his
head
on
his
hands
in
a
disconsolate
attitude
.
The
young
girl
*NL*
was
occupied
in
arranging
the
cottage
;
but
presently
she
took
something
*NL*
out
of
a
drawer
,
which
employed
her
hands
,
and
she
sat
down
beside
the
*NL*
old
man
,
who
,
taking
up
an
instrument
,
began
to
play
,
and
to
produce
*NL*
sounds
,
sweeter
than
the
voice
of
the
thrush
or
the
nightingale
.
It
was
*NL*
a
lovely
sight
,
even
to
me
,
poor
wretch
!
who
had
never
beheld
aught
*NL*
beautiful
before
.
The
silver
hair
and
benevolent
countenance
of
the
aged
*NL*
cottager
,
won
my
reverence
;
while
the
gentle
manners
of
the
girl
enticed
*NL*
my
love
.
He
played
a
sweet
mournful
air
,
which
I
perceived
drew
tears
*NL*
from
the
eyes
of
his
amiable
companion
,
of
which
the
old
man
took
no
*NL*
notice
,
until
she
sobbed
audibly
;
he
then
pronounced
a
few
sounds
,
and
*NL*
the
fair
creature
,
leaving
her
work
,
knelt
at
his
feet
.
He
raised
her
,
*NL*
and
smiled
with
such
kindness
and
affection
,
that
I
felt
sensations
of
a
*NL*
peculiar
and
over-powering
nature
:
they
were
a
mixture
of
pain
and
*NL*
pleasure
,
such
as
I
had
never
before
experienced
,
either
from
hunger
or
*NL*
cold
,
warmth
or
food
;
and
I
withdrew
from
the
window
,
unable
to
bear
*NL*
these
emotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
after
this
the
young
man
returned
,
bearing
on
his
shoulders
a
load
*NL*
of
wood
.
The
girl
met
him
at
the
door
,
helped
to
relieve
him
of
his
*NL*
burden
,
and
,
taking
some
of
the
fuel
into
the
cottage
,
placed
it
on
the
*NL*
fire
;
then
she
and
the
youth
went
apart
into
a
nook
of
the
cottage
,
and
*NL*
he
shewed
her
a
large
loaf
and
a
piece
of
cheese
.
She
seemed
pleased
;
*NL*
and
went
into
the
garden
for
some
roots
and
plants
,
which
she
placed
in
*NL*
water
,
and
then
upon
the
fire
.
She
afterwards
continued
her
work
,
whilst
*NL*
the
young
man
went
into
the
garden
,
and
appeared
busily
employed
in
*NL*
digging
and
pulling
up
roots
.
After
he
had
been
employed
thus
about
an
*NL*
hour
,
the
young
woman
joined
him
,
and
they
entered
the
cottage
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
man
had
,
in
the
mean
time
,
been
pensive
;
but
,
on
the
appearance
*NL*
of
his
companions
,
he
assumed
a
more
cheerful
air
,
and
they
sat
down
to
*NL*
eat
.
The
meal
was
quickly
dispatched
.
The
young
woman
was
again
occupied
*NL*
in
arranging
the
cottage
;
the
old
man
walked
before
the
cottage
in
the
*NL*
sun
for
a
few
minutes
,
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
youth
.
Nothing
could
*NL*
exceed
in
beauty
the
contrast
between
these
two
excellent
creatures
.
One
*NL*
was
old
,
with
silver
hairs
and
a
countenance
beaming
with
benevolence
*NL*
and
love
:
the
younger
was
slight
and
graceful
in
his
figure
,
and
his
*NL*
features
were
moulded
with
the
finest
symmetry
;
yet
his
eyes
and
*NL*
attitude
expressed
the
utmost
sadness
and
despondency
.
The
old
man
*NL*
returned
to
the
cottage
;
and
the
youth
,
with
tools
different
from
those
*NL*
he
had
used
in
the
morning
,
directed
his
steps
across
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Night
quickly
shut
in
;
but
,
to
my
extreme
wonder
,
I
found
that
the
*NL*
cottagers
had
a
means
of
prolonging
light
,
by
the
use
of
tapers
,
and
was
*NL*
delighted
to
find
,
that
the
setting
of
the
sun
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
*NL*
pleasure
I
experienced
in
watching
my
human
neighbours
.
In
the
evening
,
*NL*
the
young
girl
and
her
companion
were
employed
in
various
occupations
*NL*
which
I
did
not
understand
;
and
the
old
man
again
took
up
the
*NL*
instrument
,
which
produced
the
divine
sounds
that
had
enchanted
me
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
So
soon
as
he
had
finished
,
the
youth
began
,
not
to
play
,
*NL*
but
to
utter
sounds
that
were
monotonous
,
and
neither
resembling
the
*NL*
harmony
of
the
old
man
's
instrument
or
the
songs
of
the
birds
;
I
since
*NL*
found
that
he
read
aloud
,
but
at
that
time
I
knew
nothing
of
the
science
*NL*
of
words
or
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
family
,
after
having
been
thus
occupied
for
a
short
time
,
*NL*
extinguished
their
lights
,
and
retired
,
as
I
conjectured
,
to
rest
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lay
on
my
straw
,
but
I
could
not
sleep
.
I
thought
of
the
occurrences
*NL*
of
the
day
.
What
chiefly
struck
me
was
the
gentle
manners
of
these
*NL*
people
;
and
I
longed
to
join
them
,
but
dared
not
.
I
remembered
too
well
*NL*
the
treatment
I
had
suffered
the
night
before
from
the
barbarous
*NL*
villagers
,
and
resolved
,
whatever
course
of
conduct
I
might
hereafter
*NL*
think
it
right
to
pursue
,
that
for
the
present
I
would
remain
quietly
in
*NL*
my
hovel
,
watching
,
and
endeavouring
to
discover
the
motives
which
*NL*
influenced
their
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cottagers
arose
the
next
morning
before
the
sun
.
The
young
woman
*NL*
arranged
the
cottage
,
and
prepared
the
food
;
and
the
youth
departed
*NL*
after
the
first
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
day
was
passed
in
the
same
routine
as
that
which
preceded
it
.
The
*NL*
young
man
was
constantly
employed
out
of
doors
,
and
the
girl
in
various
*NL*
laborious
occupations
within
.
The
old
man
,
whom
I
soon
perceived
to
be
*NL*
blind
,
employed
his
leisure
hours
on
his
instrument
,
or
in
*NL*
contemplation
.
Nothing
could
exceed
the
love
and
respect
which
the
*NL*
younger
cottagers
exhibited
towards
their
venerable
companion
.
They
*NL*
performed
towards
him
every
little
office
of
affection
and
duty
with
*NL*
gentleness
;
and
he
rewarded
them
by
his
benevolent
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
not
entirely
happy
.
The
young
man
and
his
companion
often
*NL*
went
apart
,
and
appeared
to
weep
.
I
saw
no
cause
for
their
unhappiness
;
*NL*
but
I
was
deeply
affected
by
it
.
If
such
lovely
creatures
were
*NL*
miserable
,
it
was
less
strange
that
I
,
an
imperfect
and
solitary
being
,
*NL*
should
be
wretched
.
Yet
why
were
these
gentle
beings
unhappy
?
They
*NL*
possessed
a
delightful
house
-LRB-
for
such
it
was
in
my
eyes
-RRB-
,
and
every
*NL*
luxury
;
they
had
a
fire
to
warm
them
when
chill
,
and
delicious
viands
*NL*
when
hungry
;
they
were
dressed
in
excellent
clothes
;
and
,
still
more
,
*NL*
they
enjoyed
one
another
's
company
and
speech
,
interchanging
each
day
*NL*
looks
of
affection
and
kindness
.
What
did
their
tears
imply
?
Did
they
*NL*
really
express
pain
?
I
was
at
first
unable
to
solve
these
questions
;
but
*NL*
perpetual
attention
,
and
time
,
explained
to
me
many
appearances
which
*NL*
were
at
first
enigmatic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
considerable
period
elapsed
before
I
discovered
one
of
the
causes
of
*NL*
the
uneasiness
of
this
amiable
family
;
it
was
poverty
:
and
they
suffered
*NL*
that
evil
in
a
very
distressing
degree
.
Their
nourishment
consisted
*NL*
entirely
of
the
vegetables
of
their
garden
,
and
the
milk
of
one
cow
,
who
*NL*
gave
very
little
during
the
winter
,
when
its
masters
could
scarcely
*NL*
procure
food
to
support
it
.
They
often
,
I
believe
,
suffered
the
pangs
of
*NL*
hunger
very
poignantly
,
especially
the
two
younger
cottagers
;
for
*NL*
several
times
they
placed
food
before
the
old
man
,
when
they
reserved
*NL*
none
for
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
trait
of
kindness
moved
me
sensibly
.
I
had
been
accustomed
,
*NL*
during
the
night
,
to
steal
a
part
of
their
store
for
my
own
consumption
;
*NL*
but
when
I
found
that
in
doing
this
I
inflicted
pain
on
the
cottagers
,
I
*NL*
abstained
,
and
satisfied
myself
with
berries
,
nuts
,
and
roots
,
which
I
*NL*
gathered
from
a
neighbouring
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
discovered
also
another
means
through
which
I
was
enabled
to
assist
*NL*
their
labours
.
I
found
that
the
youth
spent
a
great
part
of
each
day
in
*NL*
collecting
wood
for
the
family
fire
;
and
,
during
the
night
,
I
often
took
*NL*
his
tools
,
the
use
of
which
I
quickly
discovered
,
and
brought
home
*NL*
firing
sufficient
for
the
consumption
of
several
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
the
first
time
that
I
did
this
,
the
young
woman
,
when
she
*NL*
opened
the
door
in
the
morning
,
appeared
greatly
astonished
on
seeing
a
*NL*
great
pile
of
wood
on
the
outside
.
She
uttered
some
words
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
,
and
the
youth
joined
her
,
who
also
expressed
surprise
.
I
*NL*
observed
,
with
pleasure
,
that
he
did
not
go
to
the
forest
that
day
,
but
*NL*
spent
it
in
repairing
the
cottage
,
and
cultivating
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
degrees
I
made
a
discovery
of
still
greater
moment
.
I
found
that
*NL*
these
people
possessed
a
method
of
communicating
their
experience
and
*NL*
feelings
to
one
another
by
articulate
sounds
.
I
perceived
that
the
words
*NL*
they
spoke
sometimes
produced
pleasure
or
pain
,
smiles
or
sadness
,
in
*NL*
the
minds
and
countenances
of
the
hearers
.
This
was
indeed
a
godlike
*NL*
science
,
and
I
ardently
desired
to
become
acquainted
with
it
.
But
I
was
*NL*
baffled
in
every
attempt
I
made
for
this
purpose
.
Their
pronunciation
*NL*
was
quick
;
and
the
words
they
uttered
,
not
having
any
apparent
connexion
*NL*
with
visible
objects
,
I
was
unable
to
discover
any
clue
by
which
I
could
*NL*
unravel
the
mystery
of
their
reference
.
By
great
application
,
however
,
*NL*
and
after
having
remained
during
the
space
of
several
revolutions
of
the
*NL*
moon
in
my
hovel
,
I
discovered
the
names
that
were
given
to
some
of
the
*NL*
most
familiar
objects
of
discourse
:
I
learned
and
applied
the
words
*NL*
_
fire
_
,
_
milk
_
,
_
bread
_
,
and
_
wood
_
.
I
learned
also
the
names
of
the
*NL*
cottagers
themselves
.
The
youth
and
his
companion
had
each
of
them
*NL*
several
names
,
but
the
old
man
had
only
one
,
which
was
_
father
_
.
The
*NL*
girl
was
called
_
sister
_
,
or
_
Agatha
_
;
and
the
youth
_
Felix
_
,
_
brother
_
,
*NL*
or
_
son
_
.
I
can
not
describe
the
delight
I
felt
when
I
learned
the
ideas
*NL*
appropriated
to
each
of
these
sounds
,
and
was
able
to
pronounce
them
.
I
*NL*
distinguished
several
other
words
,
without
being
able
as
yet
to
*NL*
understand
or
apply
them
;
such
as
_
good
_
,
_
dearest
_
,
_
unhappy
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
spent
the
winter
in
this
manner
.
The
gentle
manners
and
beauty
of
the
*NL*
cottagers
greatly
endeared
them
to
me
:
when
they
were
unhappy
,
I
felt
*NL*
depressed
;
when
they
rejoiced
,
I
sympathized
in
their
joys
.
I
saw
few
*NL*
human
beings
beside
them
;
and
if
any
other
happened
to
enter
the
*NL*
cottage
,
their
harsh
manners
and
rude
gait
only
enhanced
to
me
the
*NL*
superior
accomplishments
of
my
friends
.
The
old
man
,
I
could
perceive
,
*NL*
often
endeavoured
to
encourage
his
children
,
as
sometimes
I
found
that
*NL*
he
called
them
,
to
cast
off
their
melancholy
.
He
would
talk
in
a
*NL*
cheerful
accent
,
with
an
expression
of
goodness
that
bestowed
pleasure
*NL*
even
upon
me
.
Agatha
listened
with
respect
,
her
eyes
sometimes
filled
*NL*
with
tears
,
which
she
endeavoured
to
wipe
away
unperceived
;
but
I
*NL*
generally
found
that
her
countenance
and
tone
were
more
cheerful
after
*NL*
having
listened
to
the
exhortations
of
her
father
.
It
was
not
thus
with
*NL*
Felix
.
He
was
always
the
saddest
of
the
groupe
;
and
,
even
to
my
*NL*
unpractised
senses
,
he
appeared
to
have
suffered
more
deeply
than
his
*NL*
friends
.
But
if
his
countenance
was
more
sorrowful
,
his
voice
was
more
*NL*
cheerful
than
that
of
his
sister
,
especially
when
he
addressed
the
old
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
mention
innumerable
instances
,
which
,
although
slight
,
marked
*NL*
the
dispositions
of
these
amiable
cottagers
.
In
the
midst
of
poverty
and
*NL*
want
,
Felix
carried
with
pleasure
to
his
sister
the
first
little
white
*NL*
flower
that
peeped
out
from
beneath
the
snowy
ground
.
Early
in
the
*NL*
morning
before
she
had
risen
,
he
cleared
away
the
snow
that
obstructed
*NL*
her
path
to
the
milk-house
,
drew
water
from
the
well
,
and
brought
the
*NL*
wood
from
the
out-house
,
where
,
to
his
perpetual
astonishment
,
he
found
*NL*
his
store
always
replenished
by
an
invisible
hand
.
In
the
day
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
he
worked
sometimes
for
a
neighbouring
farmer
,
because
he
often
*NL*
went
forth
,
and
did
not
return
until
dinner
,
yet
brought
no
wood
with
*NL*
him
.
At
other
times
he
worked
in
the
garden
;
but
,
as
there
was
little
to
*NL*
do
in
the
frosty
season
,
he
read
to
the
old
man
and
Agatha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
reading
had
puzzled
me
extremely
at
first
;
but
,
by
degrees
,
I
*NL*
discovered
that
he
uttered
many
of
the
same
sounds
when
he
read
as
when
*NL*
he
talked
.
I
conjectured
,
therefore
,
that
he
found
on
the
paper
signs
*NL*
for
speech
which
he
understood
,
and
I
ardently
longed
to
comprehend
*NL*
these
also
;
but
how
was
that
possible
,
when
I
did
not
even
understand
*NL*
the
sounds
for
which
they
stood
as
signs
?
I
improved
,
however
,
sensibly
*NL*
in
this
science
,
but
not
sufficiently
to
follow
up
any
kind
of
*NL*
conversation
,
although
I
applied
my
whole
mind
to
the
endeavour
:
for
I
*NL*
easily
perceived
that
,
although
I
eagerly
longed
to
discover
myself
to
*NL*
the
cottagers
,
I
ought
not
to
make
the
attempt
until
I
had
first
become
*NL*
master
of
their
language
;
which
knowledge
might
enable
me
to
make
them
*NL*
overlook
the
deformity
of
my
figure
;
for
with
this
also
the
contrast
*NL*
perpetually
presented
to
my
eyes
had
made
me
acquainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
admired
the
perfect
forms
of
my
cottagers
--
their
grace
,
beauty
,
*NL*
and
delicate
complexions
:
but
how
was
I
terrified
,
when
I
viewed
myself
*NL*
in
a
transparent
pool
!
At
first
I
started
back
,
unable
to
believe
that
*NL*
it
was
indeed
I
who
was
reflected
in
the
mirror
;
and
when
I
became
fully
*NL*
convinced
that
I
was
in
reality
the
monster
that
I
am
,
I
was
filled
with
*NL*
the
bitterest
sensations
of
despondence
and
mortification
.
Alas
!
I
did
*NL*
not
yet
entirely
know
the
fatal
effects
of
this
miserable
deformity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the
sun
became
warmer
,
and
the
light
of
day
longer
,
the
snow
*NL*
vanished
,
and
I
beheld
the
bare
trees
and
the
black
earth
.
From
this
*NL*
time
Felix
was
more
employed
;
and
the
heart-moving
indications
of
*NL*
impending
famine
disappeared
.
Their
food
,
as
I
afterwards
found
,
was
*NL*
coarse
,
but
it
was
wholesome
;
and
they
procured
a
sufficiency
of
it
.
*NL*
Several
new
kinds
of
plants
sprung
up
in
the
garden
,
which
they
dressed
;
*NL*
and
these
signs
of
comfort
increased
daily
as
the
season
advanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
man
,
leaning
on
his
son
,
walked
each
day
at
noon
,
when
it
did
*NL*
not
rain
,
as
I
found
it
was
called
when
the
heavens
poured
forth
its
*NL*
waters
.
This
frequently
took
place
;
but
a
high
wind
quickly
dried
the
*NL*
earth
,
and
the
season
became
far
more
pleasant
than
it
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mode
of
life
in
my
hovel
was
uniform
.
During
the
morning
I
attended
*NL*
the
motions
of
the
cottagers
;
and
when
they
were
dispersed
in
various
*NL*
occupations
,
I
slept
:
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
spent
in
observing
my
*NL*
friends
.
When
they
had
retired
to
rest
,
if
there
was
any
moon
,
or
the
*NL*
night
was
star-light
,
I
went
into
the
woods
,
and
collected
my
own
food
*NL*
and
fuel
for
the
cottage
.
When
I
returned
,
as
often
as
it
was
necessary
,
*NL*
I
cleared
their
path
from
the
snow
,
and
performed
those
offices
that
I
*NL*
had
seen
done
by
Felix
.
I
afterwards
found
that
these
labours
,
performed
*NL*
by
an
invisible
hand
,
greatly
astonished
them
;
and
once
or
twice
I
heard
*NL*
them
,
on
these
occasions
,
utter
the
words
_
good
spirit
_
,
_
wonderful
_
;
*NL*
but
I
did
not
then
understand
the
signification
of
these
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
thoughts
now
became
more
active
,
and
I
longed
to
discover
the
*NL*
motives
and
feelings
of
these
lovely
creatures
;
I
was
inquisitive
to
*NL*
know
why
Felix
appeared
so
miserable
,
and
Agatha
so
sad
.
I
thought
*NL*
-LRB-
foolish
wretch
!
-RRB-
that
it
might
be
in
my
power
to
restore
happiness
to
*NL*
these
deserving
people
.
When
I
slept
,
or
was
absent
,
the
forms
of
the
*NL*
venerable
blind
father
,
the
gentle
Agatha
,
and
the
excellent
Felix
,
*NL*
flitted
before
me
.
I
looked
upon
them
as
superior
beings
,
who
would
be
*NL*
the
arbiters
of
my
future
destiny
.
I
formed
in
my
imagination
a
thousand
*NL*
pictures
of
presenting
myself
to
them
,
and
their
reception
of
me
.
I
*NL*
imagined
that
they
would
be
disgusted
,
until
,
by
my
gentle
demeanour
and
*NL*
conciliating
words
,
I
should
first
win
their
favour
,
and
afterwards
*NL*
their
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
thoughts
exhilarated
me
,
and
led
me
to
apply
with
fresh
ardour
to
*NL*
the
acquiring
the
art
of
language
.
My
organs
were
indeed
harsh
,
but
*NL*
supple
;
and
although
my
voice
was
very
unlike
the
soft
music
of
their
*NL*
tones
,
yet
I
pronounced
such
words
as
I
understood
with
tolerable
ease
.
*NL*
It
was
as
the
ass
and
the
lap-dog
;
yet
surely
the
gentle
ass
,
whose
*NL*
intentions
were
affectionate
,
although
his
manners
were
rude
,
deserved
*NL*
better
treatment
than
blows
and
execration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pleasant
showers
and
genial
warmth
of
spring
greatly
altered
the
*NL*
aspect
of
the
earth
.
Men
,
who
before
this
change
seemed
to
have
been
hid
*NL*
in
caves
,
dispersed
themselves
,
and
were
employed
in
various
arts
of
*NL*
cultivation
.
The
birds
sang
in
more
cheerful
notes
,
and
the
leaves
*NL*
began
to
bud
forth
on
the
trees

Happy

happy
earth

fit
habitation
for
*NL*
gods

which
,
so
short
a
time
before

was
bleak

damp

and
unwholesome

My
spirits
were
elevated
by
the
enchanting
appearance
of
nature
;
the
*NL*
past
was
blotted
from
my
memory

the
present
was
tranquil

gilded
by
bright

of
hope

CHAPTER
V.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
now
hasten
to
the
more
moving
part
of
my
story
.
I
shall
relate
events
*NL*
that
impressed
me
with
feelings
which
,
from
what
I
was
,
have
made
me
*NL*
what
I
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spring
advanced
rapidly
;
the
weather
became
fine
,
and
the
skies
*NL*
cloudless
.
It
surprised
me
,
that
what
before
was
desert
and
gloomy
*NL*
should
now
bloom
with
the
most
beautiful
flowers
and
verdure
.
My
senses
*NL*
were
gratified
and
refreshed
by
a
thousand
scents
of
delight
,
and
a
*NL*
thousand
sights
of
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
on
one
of
these
days
,
when
my
cottagers
periodically
rested
from
*NL*
labour
--
the
old
man
played
on
his
guitar
,
and
the
children
listened
to
*NL*
him
--
I
observed
that
the
countenance
of
Felix
was
melancholy
beyond
*NL*
expression
:
he
sighed
frequently
;
and
once
his
father
paused
in
his
*NL*
music
,
and
I
conjectured
by
his
manner
that
he
inquired
the
cause
of
his
*NL*
son
's
sorrow
.
Felix
replied
in
a
cheerful
accent
,
and
the
old
man
was
*NL*
recommencing
his
music
,
when
some
one
tapped
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
lady
on
horseback
,
accompanied
by
a
countryman
as
a
guide
.
The
*NL*
lady
was
dressed
in
a
dark
suit
,
and
covered
with
a
thick
black
veil
.
*NL*
Agatha
asked
a
question
;
to
which
the
stranger
only
replied
by
*NL*
pronouncing
,
in
a
sweet
accent
,
the
name
of
Felix
.
Her
voice
was
*NL*
musical
,
but
unlike
that
of
either
of
my
friends
.
On
hearing
this
word
,
*NL*
Felix
came
up
hastily
to
the
lady
;
who
,
when
she
saw
him
,
threw
up
her
*NL*
veil
,
and
I
beheld
a
countenance
of
angelic
beauty
and
expression
.
Her
*NL*
hair
of
a
shining
raven
black
,
and
curiously
braided
;
her
eyes
were
*NL*
dark
,
but
gentle
,
although
animated
;
her
features
of
a
regular
*NL*
proportion
,
and
her
complexion
wondrously
fair
,
each
cheek
tinged
with
a
*NL*
lovely
pink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felix
seemed
ravished
with
delight
when
he
saw
her
,
every
trait
of
*NL*
sorrow
vanished
from
his
face
,
and
it
instantly
expressed
a
degree
of
*NL*
ecstatic
joy
,
of
which
I
could
hardly
have
believed
it
capable
;
his
eyes
*NL*
sparkled
,
as
his
cheek
flushed
with
pleasure
;
and
at
that
moment
I
*NL*
thought
him
as
beautiful
as
the
stranger
.
She
appeared
affected
by
*NL*
different
feelings
;
wiping
a
few
tears
from
her
lovely
eyes
,
she
held
*NL*
out
her
hand
to
Felix
,
who
kissed
it
rapturously
,
and
called
her
,
as
*NL*
well
as
I
could
distinguish
,
his
sweet
Arabian
.
She
did
not
appear
to
*NL*
understand
him
,
but
smiled
.
He
assisted
her
to
dismount
,
and
,
dismissing
*NL*
her
guide
,
conducted
her
into
the
cottage
.
Some
conversation
took
place
*NL*
between
him
and
his
father
;
and
the
young
stranger
knelt
at
the
old
*NL*
man
's
feet
,
and
would
have
kissed
his
hand
,
but
he
raised
her
,
and
*NL*
embraced
her
affectionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
soon
perceived
,
that
although
the
stranger
uttered
articulate
sounds
,
*NL*
and
appeared
to
have
a
language
of
her
own
,
she
was
neither
understood
*NL*
by
,
or
herself
understood
,
the
cottagers
.
They
made
many
signs
which
I
*NL*
did
not
comprehend
;
but
I
saw
that
her
presence
diffused
gladness
*NL*
through
the
cottage
,
dispelling
their
sorrow
as
the
sun
dissipates
the
*NL*
morning
mists
.
Felix
seemed
peculiarly
happy
,
and
with
smiles
of
delight
*NL*
welcomed
his
Arabian
.
Agatha
,
the
ever-gentle
Agatha
,
kissed
the
hands
*NL*
of
the
lovely
stranger
;
and
,
pointing
to
her
brother
,
made
signs
which
*NL*
appeared
to
me
to
mean
that
he
had
been
sorrowful
until
she
came
.
Some
*NL*
hours
passed
thus
,
while
they
,
by
their
countenances
,
expressed
joy
,
the
*NL*
cause
of
which
I
did
not
comprehend
.
Presently
I
found
,
by
the
frequent
*NL*
recurrence
of
one
sound
which
the
stranger
repeated
after
them
,
that
she
*NL*
was
endeavouring
to
learn
their
language
;
and
the
idea
instantly
*NL*
occurred
to
me
,
that
I
should
make
use
of
the
same
instructions
to
the
*NL*
same
end
.
The
stranger
learned
about
twenty
words
at
the
first
lesson
,
*NL*
most
of
them
indeed
were
those
which
I
had
before
understood
,
but
I
*NL*
profited
by
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
night
came
on
,
Agatha
and
the
Arabian
retired
early
.
When
they
*NL*
separated
,
Felix
kissed
the
hand
of
the
stranger
,
and
said
,
`
Good
night
,
*NL*
sweet
Safie
.
'
He
sat
up
much
longer
,
conversing
with
his
father
;
and
,
by
*NL*
the
frequent
repetition
of
her
name
,
I
conjectured
that
their
lovely
*NL*
guest
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
.
I
ardently
desired
to
*NL*
understand
them
,
and
bent
every
faculty
towards
that
purpose
,
but
found
*NL*
it
utterly
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
morning
Felix
went
out
to
his
work
;
and
,
after
the
usual
*NL*
occupations
of
Agatha
were
finished
,
the
Arabian
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
*NL*
old
man
,
and
,
taking
his
guitar
,
played
some
airs
so
entrancingly
*NL*
beautiful
,
that
they
at
once
drew
tears
of
sorrow
and
delight
from
my
*NL*
eyes
.
She
sang
,
and
her
voice
flowed
in
a
rich
cadence
,
swelling
or
*NL*
dying
away
,
like
a
nightingale
of
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
she
had
finished
,
she
gave
the
guitar
to
Agatha
,
who
at
first
*NL*
declined
it
.
She
played
a
simple
air
,
and
her
voice
accompanied
it
in
*NL*
sweet
accents
,
but
unlike
the
wondrous
strain
of
the
stranger
.
The
old
*NL*
man
appeared
enraptured
,
and
said
some
words
,
which
Agatha
endeavoured
*NL*
to
explain
to
Safie
,
and
by
which
he
appeared
to
wish
to
express
that
*NL*
she
bestowed
on
him
the
greatest
delight
by
her
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
days
now
passed
as
peaceably
as
before
,
with
the
sole
alteration
,
*NL*
that
joy
had
taken
place
of
sadness
in
the
countenances
of
my
friends
.
*NL*
Safie
was
always
gay
and
happy
;
she
and
I
improved
rapidly
in
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
language
,
so
that
in
two
months
I
began
to
comprehend
most
*NL*
of
the
words
uttered
by
my
protectors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
meanwhile
also
the
black
ground
was
covered
with
herbage
,
and
*NL*
the
green
banks
interspersed
with
innumerable
flowers
,
sweet
to
the
*NL*
scent
and
the
eyes
,
stars
of
pale
radiance
among
the
moonlight
woods
;
*NL*
the
sun
became
warmer
,
the
nights
clear
and
balmy
;
and
my
nocturnal
*NL*
rambles
were
an
extreme
pleasure
to
me
,
although
they
were
considerably
*NL*
shortened
by
the
late
setting
and
early
rising
of
the
sun
;
for
I
never
*NL*
ventured
abroad
during
daylight
,
fearful
of
meeting
with
the
same
*NL*
treatment
as
I
had
formerly
endured
in
the
first
village
which
I
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
days
were
spent
in
close
attention
,
that
I
might
more
speedily
*NL*
master
the
language
;
and
I
may
boast
that
I
improved
more
rapidly
than
*NL*
the
Arabian
,
who
understood
very
little
,
and
conversed
in
broken
*NL*
accents
,
whilst
I
comprehended
and
could
imitate
almost
every
word
that
*NL*
was
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
I
improved
in
speech
,
I
also
learned
the
science
of
letters
,
as
it
*NL*
was
taught
to
the
stranger
;
and
this
opened
before
me
a
wide
field
for
*NL*
wonder
and
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
book
from
which
Felix
instructed
Safie
was
Volney
's
_
Ruins
of
*NL*
Empires
_
.
I
should
not
have
understood
the
purport
of
this
book
,
had
not
*NL*
Felix
,
in
reading
it
,
given
very
minute
explanations
.
He
had
chosen
this
*NL*
work
,
he
said
,
because
the
declamatory
style
was
framed
in
imitation
of
*NL*
the
eastern
authors
.
Through
this
work
I
obtained
a
cursory
knowledge
of
*NL*
history
,
and
a
view
of
the
several
empires
at
present
existing
in
the
*NL*
world
;
it
gave
me
an
insight
into
the
manners
,
governments
,
and
*NL*
religions
of
the
different
nations
of
the
earth
.
I
heard
of
the
slothful
*NL*
Asiatics
;
of
the
stupendous
genius
and
mental
activity
of
the
Grecians
;
*NL*
of
the
wars
and
wonderful
virtue
of
the
early
Romans
--
of
their
*NL*
subsequent
degeneration
--
of
the
decline
of
that
mighty
empire
;
of
*NL*
chivalry
,
Christianity
,
and
kings
.
I
heard
of
the
discovery
of
the
*NL*
American
hemisphere
,
and
wept
with
Safie
over
the
hapless
fate
of
its
*NL*
original
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
wonderful
narrations
inspired
me
with
strange
feelings
.
Was
man
,
*NL*
indeed
,
at
once
so
powerful
,
so
virtuous
,
and
magnificent
,
yet
so
*NL*
vicious
and
base
?
He
appeared
at
one
time
a
mere
scion
of
the
evil
*NL*
principle
,
and
at
another
as
all
that
can
be
conceived
of
noble
and
*NL*
godlike
.
To
be
a
great
and
virtuous
man
appeared
the
highest
honour
that
*NL*
can
befall
a
sensitive
being
;
to
be
base
and
vicious
,
as
many
on
record
*NL*
have
been
,
appeared
the
lowest
degradation
,
a
condition
more
abject
than
*NL*
that
of
the
blind
mole
or
harmless
worm
.
For
a
long
time
I
could
not
*NL*
conceive
how
one
man
could
go
forth
to
murder
his
fellow
,
or
even
why
*NL*
there
were
laws
and
governments
;
but
when
I
heard
details
of
vice
and
*NL*
bloodshed
,
my
wonder
ceased
,
and
I
turned
away
with
disgust
and
*NL*
loathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
conversation
of
the
cottagers
now
opened
new
wonders
to
me
.
While
*NL*
I
listened
to
the
instructions
which
Felix
bestowed
upon
the
Arabian
,
*NL*
the
strange
system
of
human
society
was
explained
to
me
.
I
heard
of
the
*NL*
division
of
property
,
of
immense
wealth
and
squalid
poverty
;
of
rank
,
*NL*
descent
,
and
noble
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
words
induced
me
to
turn
towards
myself
.
I
learned
that
the
*NL*
possessions
most
esteemed
by
your
fellow-creatures
were
,
high
and
*NL*
unsullied
descent
united
with
riches
.
A
man
might
be
respected
with
only
*NL*
one
of
these
acquisitions
;
but
without
either
he
was
considered
,
except
*NL*
in
very
rare
instances
,
as
a
vagabond
and
a
slave
,
doomed
to
waste
his
*NL*
powers
for
the
profit
of
the
chosen
few
.
And
what
was
I
?
Of
my
creation
*NL*
and
creator
I
was
absolutely
ignorant
;
but
I
knew
that
I
possessed
no
*NL*
money
,
no
friends
,
no
kind
of
property
.
I
was
,
besides
,
endowed
with
a
*NL*
figure
hideously
deformed
and
loathsome
;
I
was
not
even
of
the
same
*NL*
nature
as
man
.
I
was
more
agile
than
they
,
and
could
subsist
upon
*NL*
coarser
diet
;
I
bore
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
with
less
injury
to
*NL*
my
frame
;
my
stature
far
exceeded
their
's
.
When
I
looked
around
,
I
saw
*NL*
and
heard
of
none
like
me
.
Was
I
then
a
monster
,
a
blot
upon
the
earth
,
*NL*
from
which
all
men
fled
,
and
whom
all
men
disowned
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
describe
to
you
the
agony
that
these
reflections
inflicted
*NL*
upon
me
;
I
tried
to
dispel
them
,
but
sorrow
only
increased
with
*NL*
knowledge
.
Oh
,
that
I
had
for
ever
remained
in
my
native
wood
,
nor
known
*NL*
or
felt
beyond
the
sensations
of
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
heat
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
a
strange
nature
is
knowledge
!
It
clings
to
the
mind
,
when
it
*NL*
has
once
seized
on
it
,
like
a
lichen
on
the
rock
.
I
wished
sometimes
to
*NL*
shake
off
all
thought
and
feeling
;
but
I
learned
that
there
was
but
one
*NL*
means
to
overcome
the
sensation
of
pain
,
and
that
was
death
--
a
state
*NL*
which
I
feared
yet
did
not
understand
.
I
admired
virtue
and
good
*NL*
feelings
,
and
loved
the
gentle
manners
and
amiable
qualities
of
my
*NL*
cottagers
;
but
I
was
shut
out
from
intercourse
with
them
,
except
through
*NL*
means
which
I
obtained
by
stealth
,
when
I
was
unseen
and
unknown
,
and
*NL*
which
rather
increased
than
satisfied
the
desire
I
had
of
becoming
one
*NL*
among
my
fellows
.
The
gentle
words
of
Agatha
,
and
the
animated
smiles
of
*NL*
the
charming
Arabian
,
were
not
for
me
.
The
mild
exhortations
of
the
old
*NL*
man
,
and
the
lively
conversation
of
the
loved
Felix
,
were
not
for
me
.
*NL*
Miserable
,
unhappy
wretch
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other
lessons
were
impressed
upon
me
even
more
deeply
.
I
heard
of
the
*NL*
difference
of
sexes
;
of
the
birth
and
growth
of
children
;
how
the
father
*NL*
doated
on
the
smiles
of
the
infant
,
and
the
lively
sallies
of
the
older
*NL*
child
;
how
all
the
life
and
cares
of
the
mother
were
wrapt
up
in
the
*NL*
precious
charge
;
how
the
mind
of
youth
expanded
and
gained
knowledge
;
of
*NL*
brother
,
sister
,
and
all
the
various
relationships
which
bind
one
human
*NL*
being
to
another
in
mutual
bonds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
were
my
friends
and
relations
?
No
father
had
watched
my
*NL*
infant
days
,
no
mother
had
blessed
me
with
smiles
and
caresses
;
or
if
*NL*
they
had
,
all
my
past
life
was
now
a
blot
,
a
blind
vacancy
in
which
I
*NL*
distinguished
nothing
.
From
my
earliest
remembrance
I
had
been
as
I
then
*NL*
was
in
height
and
proportion
.
I
had
never
yet
seen
a
being
resembling
*NL*
me
,
or
who
claimed
any
intercourse
with
me
.
What
was
I
?
The
question
*NL*
again
recurred
,
to
be
answered
only
with
groans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
soon
explain
to
what
these
feelings
tended
;
but
allow
me
now
to
*NL*
return
to
the
cottagers
,
whose
story
excited
in
me
such
various
feelings
*NL*
of
indignation
,
delight
,
and
wonder
,
but
which
all
terminated
in
*NL*
additional
love
and
reverence
for
my
protectors
-LRB-
for
so
I
loved
,
in
an
*NL*
innocent
,
half
painful
self-deceit
,
to
call
them

CHAPTER
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
time
elapsed
before
I
learned
the
history
of
my
friends
.
It
was
*NL*
one
which
could
not
fail
to
impress
itself
deeply
on
my
mind
,
unfolding
*NL*
as
it
did
a
number
of
circumstances
each
interesting
and
wonderful
to
*NL*
one
so
utterly
inexperienced
as
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
of
the
old
man
was
De
Lacey
.
He
was
descended
from
a
good
*NL*
family
in
France
,
where
he
had
lived
for
many
years
in
affluence
,
*NL*
respected
by
his
superiors
,
and
beloved
by
his
equals
.
His
son
was
bred
*NL*
in
the
service
of
his
country
;
and
Agatha
had
ranked
with
ladies
of
the
*NL*
highest
distinction
.
A
few
months
before
my
arrival
,
they
had
lived
in
a
*NL*
large
and
luxurious
city
,
called
Paris
,
surrounded
by
friends
,
and
*NL*
possessed
of
every
enjoyment
which
virtue
,
refinement
of
intellect
,
or
*NL*
taste
,
accompanied
by
a
moderate
fortune
,
could
afford
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
father
of
Safie
had
been
the
cause
of
their
ruin
.
He
was
a
Turkish
*NL*
merchant
,
and
had
inhabited
Paris
for
many
years
,
when
,
for
some
reason
*NL*
which
I
could
not
learn
,
he
became
obnoxious
to
the
government
.
He
was
*NL*
seized
and
cast
into
prison
the
very
day
that
Safie
arrived
from
*NL*
Constantinople
to
join
him
.
He
was
tried
,
and
condemned
to
death
.
The
*NL*
injustice
of
his
sentence
was
very
flagrant
;
all
Paris
was
indignant
;
*NL*
and
it
was
judged
that
his
religion
and
wealth
,
rather
than
the
crime
*NL*
alleged
against
him
,
had
been
the
cause
of
his
condemnation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felix
had
been
present
at
the
trial
;
his
horror
and
indignation
were
*NL*
uncontrollable
,
when
he
heard
the
decision
of
the
court
.
He
made
,
at
*NL*
that
moment
,
a
solemn
vow
to
deliver
him
,
and
then
looked
around
for
the
*NL*
means
.
After
many
fruitless
attempts
to
gain
admittance
to
the
prison
,
*NL*
he
found
a
strongly
grated
window
in
an
unguarded
part
of
the
building
,
*NL*
which
lighted
the
dungeon
of
the
unfortunate
Mahometan
;
who
,
loaded
with
*NL*
chains
,
waited
in
despair
the
execution
of
the
barbarous
sentence
.
Felix
*NL*
visited
the
grate
at
night
,
and
made
known
to
the
prisoner
his
*NL*
intentions
in
his
favour
.
The
Turk
,
amazed
and
delighted
,
endeavoured
to
*NL*
kindle
the
zeal
of
his
deliverer
by
promises
of
reward
and
wealth
.
Felix
*NL*
rejected
his
offers
with
contempt
;
yet
when
he
saw
the
lovely
Safie
,
who
*NL*
was
allowed
to
visit
her
father
,
and
who
,
by
her
gestures
,
expressed
her
*NL*
lively
gratitude
,
the
youth
could
not
help
owning
to
his
own
mind
,
that
*NL*
the
captive
possessed
a
treasure
which
would
fully
reward
his
toil
and
*NL*
hazard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Turk
quickly
perceived
the
impression
that
his
daughter
had
made
on
*NL*
the
heart
of
Felix
,
and
endeavoured
to
secure
him
more
entirely
in
his
*NL*
interests
by
the
promise
of
her
hand
in
marriage
,
so
soon
as
he
should
*NL*
be
conveyed
to
a
place
of
safety
.
Felix
was
too
delicate
to
accept
this
*NL*
offer
;
yet
he
looked
forward
to
the
probability
of
that
event
as
to
the
*NL*
consummation
of
his
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
During
the
ensuing
days
,
while
the
preparations
were
going
forward
for
*NL*
the
escape
of
the
merchant
,
the
zeal
of
Felix
was
warmed
by
several
*NL*
letters
that
he
received
from
this
lovely
girl
,
who
found
means
to
*NL*
express
her
thoughts
in
the
language
of
her
lover
by
the
aid
of
an
old
*NL*
man
,
a
servant
of
her
father
's
,
who
understood
French
.
She
thanked
him
*NL*
in
the
most
ardent
terms
for
his
intended
services
towards
her
father
;
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
she
gently
deplored
her
own
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
copies
of
these
letters
;
for
I
found
means
,
during
my
residence
*NL*
in
the
hovel
,
to
procure
the
implements
of
writing
;
and
the
letters
were
*NL*
often
in
the
hands
of
Felix
or
Agatha
.
Before
I
depart
,
I
will
give
them
*NL*
to
you
,
they
will
prove
the
truth
of
my
tale
;
but
at
present
,
as
the
*NL*
sun
is
already
far
declined
,
I
shall
only
have
time
to
repeat
the
*NL*
substance
of
them
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safie
related
,
that
her
mother
was
a
Christian
Arab
,
seized
and
made
a
*NL*
slave
by
the
Turks
;
recommended
by
her
beauty
,
she
had
won
the
heart
of
*NL*
the
father
of
Safie
,
who
married
her
.
The
young
girl
spoke
in
high
and
*NL*
enthusiastic
terms
of
her
mother
,
who
,
born
in
freedom
spurned
the
*NL*
bondage
to
which
she
was
now
reduced
.
She
instructed
her
daughter
in
the
*NL*
tenets
of
her
religion
,
and
taught
her
to
aspire
to
higher
powers
of
*NL*
intellect
,
and
an
independence
of
spirit
,
forbidden
to
the
female
*NL*
followers
of
Mahomet
.
This
lady
died
;
but
her
lessons
were
indelibly
*NL*
impressed
on
the
mind
of
Safie
,
who
sickened
at
the
prospect
of
again
*NL*
returning
to
Asia
,
and
the
being
immured
within
the
walls
of
a
haram
,
*NL*
allowed
only
to
occupy
herself
with
puerile
amusements
,
ill
suited
to
*NL*
the
temper
of
her
soul
,
now
accustomed
to
grand
ideas
and
a
noble
*NL*
emulation
for
virtue
.
The
prospect
of
marrying
a
Christian
,
and
*NL*
remaining
in
a
country
where
women
were
allowed
to
take
a
rank
in
*NL*
society
,
was
enchanting
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
for
the
execution
of
the
Turk
was
fixed
;
but
,
on
the
night
*NL*
previous
to
it
,
he
had
quitted
prison
,
and
before
morning
was
distant
*NL*
many
leagues
from
Paris
.
Felix
had
procured
passports
in
the
name
of
his
*NL*
father
,
sister
,
and
himself
.
He
had
previously
communicated
his
plan
to
*NL*
the
former
,
who
aided
the
deceit
by
quitting
his
house
,
under
the
*NL*
pretence
of
a
journey
,
and
concealed
himself
,
with
his
daughter
,
in
an
*NL*
obscure
part
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felix
conducted
the
fugitives
through
France
to
Lyons
,
and
across
Mont
*NL*
Cenis
to
Leghorn
,
where
the
merchant
had
decided
to
wait
a
favourable
*NL*
opportunity
of
passing
into
some
part
of
the
Turkish
dominions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safie
resolved
to
remain
with
her
father
until
the
moment
of
his
*NL*
departure
,
before
which
time
the
Turk
renewed
his
promise
that
she
*NL*
should
be
united
to
his
deliverer
;
and
Felix
remained
with
them
in
*NL*
expectation
of
that
event
;
and
in
the
mean
time
he
enjoyed
the
society
*NL*
of
the
Arabian
,
who
exhibited
towards
him
the
simplest
and
tenderest
*NL*
affection
.
They
conversed
with
one
another
through
the
means
of
an
*NL*
interpreter
,
and
sometimes
with
the
interpretation
of
looks
;
and
Safie
*NL*
sang
to
him
the
divine
airs
of
her
native
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Turk
allowed
this
intimacy
to
take
place
,
and
encouraged
the
hopes
*NL*
of
the
youthful
lovers
,
while
in
his
heart
he
had
formed
far
other
*NL*
plans
.
He
loathed
the
idea
that
his
daughter
should
be
united
to
a
*NL*
Christian
;
but
he
feared
the
resentment
of
Felix
if
he
should
appear
*NL*
lukewarm
;
for
he
knew
that
he
was
still
in
the
power
of
his
deliverer
,
*NL*
if
he
should
choose
to
betray
him
to
the
Italian
state
which
they
*NL*
inhabited
.
He
revolved
a
thousand
plans
by
which
he
should
be
enabled
to
*NL*
prolong
the
deceit
until
it
might
be
no
longer
necessary
,
and
secretly
*NL*
to
take
his
daughter
with
him
when
he
departed
.
His
plans
were
greatly
*NL*
facilitated
by
the
news
which
arrived
from
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
government
of
France
were
greatly
enraged
at
the
escape
of
their
*NL*
victim
,
and
spared
no
pains
to
detect
and
punish
his
deliverer
.
The
plot
*NL*
of
Felix
was
quickly
discovered
,
and
De
Lacey
and
Agatha
were
thrown
*NL*
into
prison
.
The
news
reached
Felix
,
and
roused
him
from
his
dream
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
His
blind
and
aged
father
,
and
his
gentle
sister
,
lay
in
a
*NL*
noisome
dungeon
,
while
he
enjoyed
the
free
air
,
and
the
society
of
her
*NL*
whom
he
loved
.
This
idea
was
torture
to
him
.
He
quickly
arranged
with
*NL*
the
Turk
,
that
if
the
latter
should
find
a
favourable
opportunity
for
*NL*
escape
before
Felix
could
return
to
Italy
,
Safie
should
remain
as
a
*NL*
boarder
at
a
convent
at
Leghorn
;
and
then
,
quitting
the
lovely
Arabian
,
*NL*
he
hastened
to
Paris
,
and
delivered
himself
up
to
the
vengeance
of
the
*NL*
law
,
hoping
to
free
De
Lacey
and
Agatha
by
this
proceeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
succeed
.
They
remained
confined
for
five
months
before
the
*NL*
trial
took
place
;
the
result
of
which
deprived
them
of
their
fortune
,
*NL*
and
condemned
them
to
a
perpetual
exile
from
their
native
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
found
a
miserable
asylum
in
the
cottage
in
Germany
,
where
I
*NL*
discovered
them
.
Felix
soon
learned
that
the
treacherous
Turk
,
for
whom
*NL*
he
and
his
family
endured
such
unheard-of
oppression
,
on
discovering
*NL*
that
his
deliverer
was
thus
reduced
to
poverty
and
impotence
,
became
a
*NL*
traitor
to
good
feeling
and
honour
,
and
had
quitted
Italy
with
his
*NL*
daughter
,
insultingly
sending
Felix
a
pittance
of
money
to
aid
him
,
as
*NL*
he
said
,
in
some
plan
of
future
maintenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
were
the
events
that
preyed
on
the
heart
of
Felix
,
and
rendered
*NL*
him
,
when
I
first
saw
him
,
the
most
miserable
of
his
family
.
He
could
*NL*
have
endured
poverty
,
and
when
this
distress
had
been
the
meed
of
his
*NL*
virtue
,
he
would
have
gloried
in
it
:
but
the
ingratitude
of
the
Turk
,
*NL*
and
the
loss
of
his
beloved
Safie
,
were
misfortunes
more
bitter
and
*NL*
irreparable
.
The
arrival
of
the
Arabian
now
infused
new
life
into
his
*NL*
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
news
reached
Leghorn
,
that
Felix
was
deprived
of
his
wealth
*NL*
and
rank
,
the
merchant
commanded
his
daughter
to
think
no
more
of
her
*NL*
lover
,
but
to
prepare
to
return
with
him
to
her
native
country
.
The
*NL*
generous
nature
of
Safie
was
outraged
by
this
command
;
she
attempted
to
*NL*
expostulate
with
her
father
,
but
he
left
her
angrily
,
reiterating
his
*NL*
tyrannical
mandate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
few
days
after
,
the
Turk
entered
his
daughter
's
apartment
,
and
told
*NL*
her
hastily
,
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
his
residence
at
Leghorn
*NL*
had
been
divulged
,
and
that
he
should
speedily
be
delivered
up
to
the
*NL*
French
government
;
he
had
,
consequently
,
hired
a
vessel
to
convey
him
*NL*
to
Constantinople
,
for
which
city
he
should
sail
in
a
few
hours
.
He
*NL*
intended
to
leave
his
daughter
under
the
care
of
a
confidential
servant
,
*NL*
to
follow
at
her
leisure
with
the
greater
part
of
his
property
,
which
*NL*
had
not
yet
arrived
at
Leghorn
.

*NL*
``
When
alone

Safie
resolved
in
her
own
mind
the
plan
of
conduct
that
it
*NL*
would
become
her
to
pursue
in
this
emergency
.
A
residence
in
Turkey
was
*NL*
abhorrent
to
her
;
her
religion
and
feelings
were
alike
adverse
to
it
.
By
*NL*
some
papers
of
her
father
's
,
which
fell
into
her
hands
,
she
heard
of
the
*NL*
exile
of
her
lover
,
and
learnt
the
name
of
the
spot
where
he
then
*NL*
resided
.
She
hesitated
some
time
,
but
at
length
she
formed
her
*NL*
determination
.
Taking
with
her
some
jewels
that
belonged
to
her
,
and
a
*NL*
small
sum
of
money
,
she
quitted
Italy
,
with
an
attendant
,
a
native
of
*NL*
Leghorn
,
but
who
understood
the
common
language
of
Turkey
,
and
departed
*NL*
for
Germany
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
arrived
in
safety
at
a
town
about
twenty
leagues
from
the
cottage
*NL*
of
De
Lacey
,
when
her
attendant
fell
dangerously
ill
.
Safie
nursed
her
*NL*
with
the
most
devoted
affection
;
but
the
poor
girl
died
,
and
the
Arabian
*NL*
was
left
alone
,
unacquainted
with
the
language
of
the
country
,
and
*NL*
utterly
ignorant
of
the
customs
of
the
world
.
She
fell
,
however
,
into
*NL*
good
hands
.
The
Italian
had
mentioned
the
name
of
the
spot
for
which
*NL*
they
were
bound
;
and
,
after
her
death
,
the
woman
of
the
house
in
which
*NL*
they
had
lived
took

CHAPTER
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
was
the
history
of
my
beloved
cottagers
.
It
impressed
me
deeply
.
I
*NL*
learned
,
from
the
views
of
social
life
which
it
developed
,
to
admire
*NL*
their
virtues
,
and
to
deprecate
the
vices
of
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
yet
I
looked
upon
crime
as
a
distant
evil
;
benevolence
and
*NL*
generosity
were
ever
present
before
me
,
inciting
within
me
a
desire
to
*NL*
become
an
actor
in
the
busy
scene
where
so
many
admirable
qualities
were
*NL*
called
forth
and
displayed
.
But
,
in
giving
an
account
of
the
progress
of
*NL*
my
intellect
,
I
must
not
omit
a
circumstance
which
occurred
in
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
month
of
August
of
the
same
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
night
,
during
my
accustomed
visit
to
the
neighbouring
wood
,
where
I
*NL*
collected
my
own
food
,
and
brought
home
firing
for
my
protectors
,
I
*NL*
found
on
the
ground
a
leathern
portmanteau
,
containing
several
articles
*NL*
of
dress
and
some
books
.
I
eagerly
seized
the
prize
,
and
returned
with
*NL*
it
to
my
hovel
.
Fortunately
the
books
were
written
in
the
language
the
*NL*
elements
of
which
I
had
acquired
at
the
cottage
;
they
consisted
of
*NL*
_
Paradise
Lost
_
,
a
volume
of
_
Plutarch
's
Lives
_
,
and
the
_
Sorrows
of
*NL*
Werter
_
.
The
possession
of
these
treasures
gave
me
extreme
delight
;
I
*NL*
now
continually
studied
and
exercised
my
mind
upon
these
histories
,
*NL*
whilst
my
friends
were
employed
in
their
ordinary
occupations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hardly
describe
to
you
the
effect
of
these
books
.
They
produced
*NL*
in
me
an
infinity
of
new
images
and
feelings
,
that
sometimes
raised
me
*NL*
to
ecstacy
,
but
more
frequently
sunk
me
into
the
lowest
dejection
.
In
*NL*
the
_
Sorrows
of
Werter
_
,
besides
the
interest
of
its
simple
and
*NL*
affecting
story
,
so
many
opinions
are
canvassed
,
and
so
many
lights
*NL*
thrown
upon
what
had
hitherto
been
to
me
obscure
subjects
,
that
I
found
*NL*
in
it
a
never-ending
source
of
speculation
and
astonishment
.
The
gentle
*NL*
and
domestic
manners
it
described
,
combined
with
lofty
sentiments
and
*NL*
feelings
,
which
had
for
their
object
something
out
of
self
,
accorded
*NL*
well
with
my
experience
among
my
protectors
,
and
with
the
wants
which
*NL*
were
for
ever
alive
in
my
own
bosom
.
But
I
thought
Werter
himself
a
more
*NL*
divine
being
than
I
had
ever
beheld
or
imagined
;
his
character
contained
*NL*
no
pretension
,
but
it
sunk
deep
.
The
disquisitions
upon
death
and
*NL*
suicide
were
calculated
to
fill
me
with
wonder
.
I
did
not
pretend
to
*NL*
enter
into
the
merits
of
the
case
,
yet
I
inclined
towards
the
opinions
*NL*
of
the
hero
,
whose
extinction
I
wept
,
without
precisely
understanding
*NL*
it
.

As
I
read
,
however
,
I
applied
much
personally
to
my
own
feelings
and
*NL*
condition
.
I
found
myself
similar
,
yet
at
the
same
time
strangely
unlike
*NL*
the
beings
concerning
whom
I
read
,
and
to
whose
conversation
I
was
a
*NL*
listener
.
I
sympathized
with
,
and
partly
understood
them
,
but
I
was
*NL*
unformed
in
mind
;
I
was
dependent
on
none
,
and
related
to
none
.
`
The
*NL*
path
of
my
departure
was
free
;
'
and
there
was
none
to
lament
my
*NL*
annihilation
.
My
person
was
hideous
,
and
my
stature
gigantic
:
what
did
*NL*
this
mean
?
Who
was
I
?
What
was
I
?
Whence
did
I
come
?
What
was
my
*NL*
destination
?
These
questions
continually
recurred
,
but
I
was
unable
to
*NL*
solve
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
volume
of
_
Plutarch
's
Lives
_
which
I
possessed
,
contained
the
*NL*
histories
of
the
first
founders
of
the
ancient
republics
.
This
book
had
*NL*
a
far
different
effect
upon
me
from
the
_
Sorrows
of
Werter
_
.
I
learned
*NL*
from
Werter
's
imaginations
despondency
and
gloom
:
but
Plutarch
taught
me
*NL*
high
thoughts
;
he
elevated
me
above
the
wretched
sphere
of
my
own
*NL*
reflections
,
to
admire
and
love
the
heroes
of
past
ages
.
Many
things
I
*NL*
read
surpassed
my
understanding
and
experience
.
I
had
a
very
confused
*NL*
knowledge
of
kingdoms
,
wide
extents
of
country
,
mighty
rivers
,
and
*NL*
boundless
seas
.
But
I
was
perfectly
unacquainted
with
towns
,
and
large
*NL*
assemblages
of
men
.
The
cottage
of
my
protectors
had
been
the
only
*NL*
school
in
which
I
had
studied
human
nature
;
but
this
book
developed
new
*NL*
and
mightier
scenes
of
action
.
I
read
of
men
concerned
in
public
affairs
*NL*
governing
or
massacring
their
species
.
I
felt
the
greatest
ardour
for
*NL*
virtue
rise
within
me
,
and
abhorrence
for
vice
,
as
far
as
I
understood
*NL*
the
signification
of
those
terms
,
relative
as
they
were
,
as
I
applied
*NL*
them
,
to
pleasure
and
pain
alone
.
Induced
by
these
feelings
,
I
was
of
*NL*
course
led
to
admire
peaceable
law-givers
,
Numa
,
Solon
,
and
Lycurgus
,
*NL*
in
preference
to
Romulus
and
Theseus
.
The
patriarchal
lives
of
my
*NL*
protectors
caused
these
impressions
to
take
a
firm
hold
on
my
mind
;
*NL*
perhaps
,
if
my
first
introduction
to
humanity
had
been
made
by
a
young
*NL*
soldier
,
burning
for
glory
and
slaughter
,
I
should
have
been
imbued
with
*NL*
different
sensations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
_
Paradise
Lost
_
excited
different
and
far
deeper
emotions
.
I
read
*NL*
it
,
as
I
had
read
the
other
volumes
which
had
fallen
into
my
hands
,
as
a
*NL*
true
history
.
It
moved
every
feeling
of
wonder
and
awe
,
that
the
picture
*NL*
of
an
omnipotent
God
warring
with
his
creatures
was
capable
of
exciting
.
*NL*
I
often
referred
the
several
situations
,
as
their
similarity
struck
me
,
*NL*
to
my
own
.
Like
Adam
,
I
was
created
apparently
united
by
no
link
to
any
*NL*
other
being
in
existence
;
but
his
state
was
far
different
from
mine
in
*NL*
every
other
respect
.
He
had
come
forth
from
the
hands
of
God
a
perfect
*NL*
creature
,
happy
and
prosperous
,
guarded
by
the
especial
care
of
his
*NL*
Creator
;
he
was
allowed
to
converse
with
,
and
acquire
knowledge
from
*NL*
beings
of
a
superior
nature
:
but
I
was
wretched
,
helpless
,
and
alone
.
*NL*
Many
times
I
considered
Satan
as
the
fitter
emblem
of
my
condition
;
for
*NL*
often
,
like
him
,
when
I
viewed
the
bliss
of
my
protectors
,
the
bitter
*NL*
gall
of
envy
rose
within
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
circumstance
strengthened
and
confirmed
these
feelings
.
Soon
*NL*
after
my
arrival
in
the
hovel
,
I
discovered
some
papers
in
the
pocket
of
*NL*
the
dress
which
I
had
taken
from
your
laboratory
.
At
first
I
had
*NL*
neglected
them
;
but
now
that
I
was
able
to
decypher
the
characters
in
*NL*
which
they
were
written
,
I
began
to
study
them
with
diligence
.
It
was
*NL*
your
journal
of
the
four
months
that
preceded
my
creation
.
You
minutely
*NL*
described
in
these
papers
every
step
you
took
in
the
progress
of
your
*NL*
work
;
this
history
was
mingled
with
accounts
of
domestic
occurrences
.
*NL*
You
,
doubtless
,
recollect
these
papers
.
Here
they
are
.
Every
thing
is
*NL*
related
in
them
which
bears
reference
to
my
accursed
origin
;
the
whole
*NL*
detail
of
that
series
of
disgusting
circumstances
which
produced
it
is
*NL*
set
in
view
;
the
minutest
description
of
my
odious
and
loathsome
person
*NL*
is
given
,
in
language
which
painted
your
own
horrors
,
and
rendered
mine
*NL*
ineffaceable
.
I
sickened
as
I
read
.
`
Hateful
day
when
I
received
life
!
'
*NL*
I
exclaimed
in
agony
.
`
Cursed
creator
!
Why
did
you
form
a
monster
so
*NL*
hideous
that
even
you
turned
from
me
in
disgust
?
God
in
pity
made
man
*NL*
beautiful
and
alluring
,
after
his
own
image
;
but
my
form
is
a
filthy
*NL*
type
of
your
's
,
more
horrid
from
its
very
resemblance
.
Satan
had
his
*NL*
companions
,
fellow-devils
,
to
admire
and
encourage
him
;
but
I
am
*NL*
solitary
and
detested
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
were
the
reflections
of
my
hours
of
despondency
and
solitude
;
but
*NL*
when
I
contemplated
the
virtues
of
the
cottagers
,
their
amiable
and
*NL*
benevolent
dispositions
,
I
persuaded
myself
that
when
they
should
become
*NL*
acquainted
with
my
admiration
of
their
virtues
,
they
would
compassionate
*NL*
me
,
and
overlook
my
personal
deformity
.
Could
they
turn
from
their
door
*NL*
one
,
however
monstrous
,
who
solicited
their
compassion
and
friendship
?
*NL*
I
resolved
,
at
least
,
not
to
despair
,
but
in
every
way
to
fit
myself
for
*NL*
an
interview
with
them
which
would
decide
my
fate
.
I
postponed
this
*NL*
attempt
for
some
months
longer
;
for
the
importance
attached
to
its
*NL*
success
inspired
me
with
a
dread
lest
I
should
fail
.
Besides
,
I
found
*NL*
that
my
understanding
improved
so
much
with
every
day
's
experience
,
that
*NL*
I
was
unwilling
to
commence
this
undertaking
until
a
few
more
months
*NL*
should
have
added
to
my
wisdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Several
changes
,
in
the
mean
time
,
took
place
in
the
cottage
.
The
*NL*
presence
of
Safie
diffused
happiness
among
its
inhabitants
;
and
I
also
*NL*
found
that
a
greater
degree
of
plenty
reigned
there
.
Felix
and
Agatha
*NL*
spent
more
time
in
amusement
and
conversation
,
and
were
assisted
in
*NL*
their
labours
by
servants
.
They
did
not
appear
rich
,
but
they
were
*NL*
contented
and
happy
;
their
feelings
were
serene
and
peaceful
,
while
mine
*NL*
became
every
day
more
tumultuous
.
Increase
of
knowledge
only
discovered
*NL*
to
me
more
clearly
what
a
wretched
outcast
I
was
.
I
cherished
hope
,
it
*NL*
is
true
;
but
it
vanished
,
when
I
beheld
my
person
reflected
in
water
,
or
*NL*
my
shadow
in
the
moon-shine
,
even
as
that
frail
image
and
that
*NL*
inconstant
shade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
endeavoured
to
crush
these
fears
,
and
to
fortify
myself
for
the
trial
*NL*
which
in
a
few
months
I
resolved
to
undergo
;
and
sometimes
I
allowed
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
unchecked
by
reason
,
to
ramble
in
the
fields
of
Paradise
,
and
*NL*
dared
to
fancy
amiable
and
lovely
creatures
sympathizing
with
my
*NL*
feelings
and
cheering
my
gloom
;
their
angelic
countenances
breathed
*NL*
smiles
of
consolation
.
But
it
was
all
a
dream
:
no
Eve
soothed
my
*NL*
sorrows
,
or
shared
my
thoughts
;
I
was
alone
.
I
remembered
Adam
's
*NL*
supplication
to
his
Creator
;
but
where
was
mine
?
he
had
abandoned
me
,
*NL*
and
,
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
,
I
cursed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Autumn
passed
thus
.
I
saw
,
with
surprise
and
grief
,
the
leaves
decay
*NL*
and
fall
,
and
nature
again
assume
the
barren
and
bleak
appearance
it
had
*NL*
worn
when
I
first
beheld
the
woods
and
the
lovely
moon
.
Yet
I
did
not
*NL*
heed
the
bleakness
of
the
weather
;
I
was
better
fitted
by
my
*NL*
conformation
for
the
endurance
of
cold
than
heat
.
But
my
chief
delights
*NL*
were
the
sight
of
the
flowers
,
the
birds
,
and
all
the
gay
apparel
of
*NL*
summer
;
when
those
deserted
me
,
I
turned
with
more
attention
towards
the
*NL*
cottagers
.
Their
happiness
was
not
decreased
by
the
absence
of
summer
.
*NL*
They
loved
,
and
sympathized
with
one
another
;
and
their
joys
,
depending
*NL*
on
each
other
,
were
not
interrupted
by
the
casualties
that
took
place
*NL*
around
them
.
The
more
I
saw
of
them
,
the
greater
became
my
desire
to
*NL*
claim
their
protection
and
kindness
;
my
heart
yearned
to
be
known
and
*NL*
loved
by
these
amiable
creatures
:
to
see
their
sweet
looks
turned
*NL*
towards
me
with
affection
,
was
the
utmost
limit
of
my
ambition
.
I
dared
*NL*
not
think
that
they
would
turn
them
from
me
with
disdain
and
horror
.
The
*NL*
poor
that
stopped
at
their
door
were
never
driven
away
.
I
asked
,
it
is
*NL*
true
,
for
greater
treasures
than
a
little
food
or
rest
;
I
required
*NL*
kindness
and
sympathy
;
but
I
did
not
believe
myself
utterly
unworthy
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
winter
advanced
,
and
an
entire
revolution
of
the
seasons
had
taken
*NL*
place
since
I
awoke
into
life
.
My
attention
,
at
this
time
,
was
solely
*NL*
directed
towards
my
plan
of
introducing
myself
into
the
cottage
of
my
*NL*
protectors
.
I
revolved
many
projects
;
but
that
on
which
I
finally
fixed
*NL*
was
,
to
enter
the
dwelling
when
the
blind
old
man
should
be
alone
.
I
had
*NL*
sagacity
enough
to
discover
,
that
the
unnatural
hideousness
of
my
person
*NL*
was
the
chief
object
of
horror
with
those
who
had
formerly
beheld
me
.
My
*NL*
voice
,
although
harsh
,
had
nothing
terrible
in
it
;
I
thought
,
therefore
,
*NL*
that
if
,
in
the
absence
of
his
children
,
I
could
gain
the
good-will
and
*NL*
mediation
of
the
old
De
Lacy
,
I
might
,
by
his
means
,
be
tolerated
by
my
*NL*
younger
protectors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
,
when
the
sun
shone
on
the
red
leaves
that
strewed
the
ground
,
*NL*
and
diffused
cheerfulness
,
although
it
denied
warmth
,
Safie
,
Agatha
,
and
*NL*
Felix
,
departed
on
a
long
country
walk
,
and
the
old
man
,
at
his
own
*NL*
desire
,
was
left
alone
in
the
cottage
.
When
his
children
had
departed
,
*NL*
he
took
up
his
guitar
,
and
played
several
mournful
,
but
sweet
airs
,
more
*NL*
sweet
and
mournful
than
I
had
ever
heard
him
play
before
.
At
first
his
*NL*
countenance
was
illuminated
with
pleasure
,
but
,
as
he
continued
,
*NL*
thoughtfulness
and
sadness
succeeded
;
at
length
,
laying
aside
the
*NL*
instrument
,
he
sat
absorbed
in
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
heart
beat
quick
;
this
was
the
hour
and
moment
of
trial
,
which
*NL*
would
decide
my
hopes
,
or
realize
my
fears
.
The
servants
were
gone
to
a
*NL*
neighbouring
fair
.
All
was
silent
in
and
around
the
cottage
:
it
was
an
*NL*
excellent
opportunity
;
yet
,
when
I
proceeded
to
execute
my
plan
,
my
*NL*
limbs
failed
me
,
and
I
sunk
to
the
ground
.
Again
I
rose
;
and
,
exerting
*NL*
all
the
firmness
of
which
I
was
master
,
removed
the
planks
which
I
had
*NL*
placed
before
my
hovel
to
conceal
my
retreat
.
The
fresh
air
revived
me
,
*NL*
and
,
with
renewed
determination
,
I
approached
the
door
of
their
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knocked
.
`
Who
is
there
?

said
the
old
man
--
`
Come
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
entered
;
`
Pardon
this
intrusion

'
said
I
,
'
I
am
a
traveller
in
want

of
a
little
rest

greatly
oblige

remain
a
few
minutes
before

fire

`
Enter

'
said
De
Lacy
;
`
and
I
will
try
in
what
manner
I
can
relieve
*NL*
your
wants
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
my
children
are
from
home
,
and
,
as
I
am
*NL*
blind
,
I
am
afraid
I
shall
find
it
difficult
to
procure
food
for
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
not
trouble
yourself
,
my
kind
host

have
food
;
it
is
warmth
and
*NL*
rest
only
that
I
need
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sat
down
,
and
a
silence
ensued
.
I
knew
that
every
minute
was
precious
*NL*
to
me
,
yet
I
remained
irresolute
in
what
manner
to
commence
the
*NL*
interview
;
when
the
old
man
addressed
me
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
By
your
language
,
stranger
,
I
suppose
you
are
my
countryman
;
--
are
you
*NL*
French
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
No
;
but
I
was
educated
by
a
French
family
,
and
understand
that
*NL*
language
only
.
I
am
now
going
to
claim
the
protection
of
some
friends
,
*NL*
whom
I
sincerely
love
,
and
of
whose
favour
I
have
some
hopes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Are
these
Germans
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
No
,
they
are
French
.
But
let
us
change
the
subject
.
I
am
an
*NL*
unfortunate
and
deserted
creature
;
I
look
around
,
and
I
have
no
relation
*NL*
or
friend
upon
earth
.
These
amiable
people
to
whom
I
go
have
never
seen
*NL*
me
,
and
know
little
of
me
.
I
am
full
of
fears
;
for
if
I
fail
there
,
I
am
*NL*
an
outcast
in
the
world
for
ever
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
not
despair
.
To
be
friendless
is
indeed
to
be
unfortunate
;
but
the
*NL*
hearts
of
men
,
when
unprejudiced
by
any
obvious
self-interest
,
are
full
*NL*
of
brotherly
love
and
charity
.
Rely
,
therefore
,
on
your
hopes
;
and
if
*NL*
these
friends
are
good
and
amiable
,
do
not
despair
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
They

the

the

destroyed
all

sank
on

sobbed
aloud

At

I
heard
the
steps
of
my

I
had
not
a

I
cried

At
that

the

entered

Agatha
fainted
;

Safie
,
unable

attend
to
her

rushed
out

Felix
darted
forward

me

CHAPTER
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cursed
,
cursed
creator
!
Why
did
I
live
?
Why
,
in
that
instant
,
did
I
not
*NL*
extinguish
the
spark
of
existence
which
you
had
so
wantonly
bestowed
?
I
*NL*
know
not
;
despair
had
not
yet
taken
possession
of
me
;
my
feelings
were
*NL*
those
of
rage
and
revenge
.
I
could
with
pleasure
have
destroyed
the
*NL*
cottage
and
its
inhabitants
,
and
have
glutted
myself
with
their
shrieks
*NL*
and
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
night
came
,
I
quitted
my
retreat
,
and
wandered
in
the
wood
;
and
*NL*
now
,
no
longer
restrained
by
the
fear
of
discovery
,
I
gave
vent
to
my
*NL*
anguish
in
fearful
howlings
.
I
was
like
a
wild
beast
that
had
broken
the
*NL*
toils
;
destroying
the
objects
that
obstructed
me
,
and
ranging
through
*NL*
the
wood
with
a
stag-like
swiftness
.
Oh
!
what
a
miserable
night
I
*NL*
passed
!
the
cold
stars
shone
in
mockery
,
and
the
bare
trees
waved
their
*NL*
branches
above
me
:
now
and
then
the
sweet
voice
of
a
bird
burst
forth
*NL*
amidst
the
universal
stillness
.
All
,
save
I
,
were
at
rest
or
in
*NL*
enjoyment
:
I
,
like
the
arch
fiend
,
bore
a
hell
within
me
;
and
,
finding
*NL*
myself
unsympathized
with
,
wished
to
tear
up
the
trees
,
spread
havoc
and
*NL*
destruction
around
me
,
and
then
to
have
sat
down
and
enjoyed
the
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
was
a
luxury
of
sensation
that
could
not
endure
;
I
became
*NL*
fatigued
with
excess
of
bodily
exertion
,
and
sank
on
the
damp
grass
in
*NL*
the
sick
impotence
of
despair
.
There
was
none
among
the
myriads
of
men
*NL*
that
existed
who
would
pity
or
assist
me
;
and
should
I
feel
kindness
*NL*
towards
my
enemies
?
No
:
from
that
moment
I
declared
everlasting
war
*NL*
against
the
species
,
and
,
more
than
all
,
against
him
who
had
formed
me
,
*NL*
and
sent
me
forth
to
this
insupportable
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sun
rose
;
I
heard
the
voices
of
men
,
and
knew
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
return
to
my
retreat
during
that
day
.
Accordingly
I
hid
*NL*
myself
in
some
thick
underwood
,
determining
to
devote
the
ensuing
hours
*NL*
to
reflection
on
my
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pleasant
sunshine
,
and
the
pure
air
of
day
,
restored
me
to
some
*NL*
degree
of
tranquillity
;
and
when
I
considered
what
had
passed
at
the
*NL*
cottage
,
I
could
not
help
believing
that
I
had
been
too
hasty
in
my
*NL*
conclusions
.
I
had
certainly
acted
imprudently
.
It
was
apparent
that
my
*NL*
conversation
had
interested
the
father
in
my
behalf
,
and
I
was
a
fool
in
*NL*
having
exposed
my
person
to
the
horror
of
his
children
.
I
ought
to
have
*NL*
familiarized
the
old
De
Lacy
to
me
,
and
by
degrees
have
discovered
*NL*
myself
to
the
rest
of
his
family
,
when
they
should
have
been
prepared
*NL*
for
my
approach
.
But
I
did
not
believe
my
errors
to
be
irretrievable
;
*NL*
and
,
after
much
consideration
,
I
resolved
to
return
to
the
cottage
,
seek
*NL*
the
old
man
,
and
by
my
representations
win
him
to
my
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
thoughts
calmed
me
,
and
in
the
afternoon
I
sank
into
a
profound
*NL*
sleep
;
but
the
fever
of
my
blood
did
not
allow
me
to
be
visited
by
*NL*
peaceful
dreams
.
The
horrible
scene
of
the
preceding
day
was
for
ever
*NL*
acting
before
my
eyes
;
the
females
were
flying
,
and
the
enraged
Felix
*NL*
tearing
me
from
his
father
's
feet
.
I
awoke
exhausted
;
and
,
finding
that
*NL*
it
was
already
night
,
I
crept
forth
from
my
hiding-place
,
and
went
in
*NL*
search
of
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
hunger
was
appeased
,
I
directed
my
steps
towards
the
well-known
*NL*
path
that
conducted
to
the
cottage
.
All
there
was
at
peace
.
I
crept
into
*NL*
my
hovel
,
and
remained
in
silent
expectation
of
the
accustomed
hour
when
*NL*
the
family
arose
.
That
hour
past
,
the
sun
mounted
high
in
the
heavens
,
*NL*
but
the
cottagers
did
not
appear
.
I
trembled
violently
,
apprehending
*NL*
some
dreadful
misfortune
.
The
inside
of
the
cottage
was
dark
,
and
I
*NL*
heard
no
motion
;
I
can
not
describe
the
agony
of
this
suspence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently
two
countrymen
passed
by
;
but
,
pausing
near
the
cottage
,
they
*NL*
entered
into
conversation
,
using
violent
gesticulations
;
but
I
did
not
*NL*
understand
what
they
said
,
as
they
spoke
the
language
of
the
country
,
*NL*
which
differed
from
that
of
my
protectors
.
Soon
after
,
however
,
Felix
*NL*
approached
with
another
man
:
I
was
surprised
,
as
I
knew
that
he
had
not
*NL*
quitted
the
cottage
that
morning
,
and
waited
anxiously
to
discover
,
from
*NL*
his
discourse
,
the
meaning
of
these
unusual
appearances
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
you
consider
,
'
said
his
companion
to
him
,
`
that
you
will
be
obliged
*NL*
to
pay
three
months
'
rent
,
and
to
lose
the
produce
of
your
garden
?
I
do
*NL*
not
wish
to
take
any
unfair
advantage
,
and
I
beg
therefore
that
you
will
*NL*
take
some
days
to
consider
of
your
determination
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
is
utterly
useless
,
'
replied
Felix
,
`
we
can
never
again
inhabit
*NL*
your
cottage
.
The
life
of
my
father
is
in
the
greatest
danger
,
owing
to
*NL*
the
dreadful
circumstance
that
I
have
related
.
My
wife
and
my
sister
*NL*
will
never
recover
their
horror
.
I
entreat
you
not
to
reason
with
me
any
*NL*
more
.
Take
possession
of
your
tenement
,
and
let
me
fly
from
this
place
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felix
trembled
violently
as
he
said
this
.
He
and
his
companion
entered
*NL*
the
cottage
,
in
which
they
remained
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
then
*NL*
departed
.
I
never
saw
any
of
the
family
of
De
Lacy
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
continued
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
my
hovel
in
a
state
of
*NL*
utter
and
stupid
despair
.
My
protectors
had
departed
,
and
had
broken
the
*NL*
only
link
that
held
me
to
the
world
.
For
the
first
time
the
feelings
of
*NL*
revenge
and
hatred
filled
my
bosom
,
and
I
did
not
strive
to
controul
*NL*
them
;
but
,
allowing
myself
to
be
borne
away
by
the
stream
,
I
bent
my
*NL*
mind
towards
injury
and
death
.
When
I
thought
of
my
friends
,
of
the
mild
*NL*
voice
of
De
Lacy
,
the
gentle
eyes
of
Agatha
,
and
the
exquisite
beauty
of
*NL*
the
Arabian
,
these
thoughts
vanished
,
and
a
gush
of
tears
somewhat
*NL*
soothed
me
.
But
again
,
when
I
reflected
that
they
had
spurned
and
*NL*
deserted
me
,
anger
returned
,
a
rage
of
anger
;
and
,
unable
to
injure
any
*NL*
thing
human
,
I
turned
my
fury
towards
inanimate
objects
.
As
night
*NL*
advanced
,
I
placed
a
variety
of
combustibles
around
the
cottage
;
and
,
*NL*
after
having
destroyed
every
vestige
of
cultivation
in
the
garden
,
I
*NL*
waited
with
forced
impatience
until
the
moon
had
sunk
to
commence
my
*NL*
operations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the
night
advanced
,
a
fierce
wind
arose
from
the
woods
,
and
quickly
*NL*
dispersed
the
clouds
that
had
loitered
in
the
heavens
:
the
blast
tore
*NL*
along
like
a
mighty
avalanche
,
and
produced
a
kind
of
insanity
in
my
*NL*
spirits
,
that
burst
all
bounds
of
reason
and
reflection
.
I
lighted
the
*NL*
dry
branch
of
a
tree
,
and
danced
with
fury
around
the
devoted
cottage
,
*NL*
my
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
western
horizon
,
the
edge
of
which
the
moon
*NL*
nearly
touched
.
A
part
of
its
orb
was
at
length
hid
,
and
I
waved
my
*NL*
brand
;
it
sunk
,
and
,
with
a
loud
scream
,
I
fired
the
straw
,
and
heath
,
*NL*
and
bushes
,
which
I
had
collected
.
The
wind
fanned
the
fire
,
and
the
*NL*
cottage
was
quickly
enveloped
by
the
flames
,
which
clung
to
it
,
and
*NL*
licked
it
with
their
forked
and
destroying
tongues
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
I
was
convinced
that
no
assistance
could
save
any
part
of
*NL*
the
habitation
,
I
quitted
the
scene
,
and
sought
for
refuge
in
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
with
the
world
before
me
,
whither
should
I
bend
my
steps
?
I
*NL*
resolved
to
fly
far
from
the
scene
of
my
misfortunes
;
but
to
me
,
hated
*NL*
and
despised
,
every
country
must
be
equally
horrible
.
At
length
the
*NL*
thought
of
you
crossed
my
mind
.
I
learned
from
your
papers
that
you
were
*NL*
my
father
,
my
creator
;
and
to
whom
could
I
apply
with
more
fitness
than
*NL*
to
him
who
had
given
me
life
?
Among
the
lessons
that
Felix
had
bestowed
*NL*
upon
Safie
geography
had
not
been
omitted
:
I
had
learned
from
these
the
*NL*
relative
situations
of
the
different
countries
of
the
earth
.
You
had
*NL*
mentioned
Geneva
as
the
name
of
your
native
town
;
and
towards
this
place
*NL*
I
resolved
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
was
I
to
direct
myself
?
I
knew
that
I
must
travel
in
a
*NL*
south-westerly
direction
to
reach
my
destination
;
but
the
sun
was
my
*NL*
only
guide
.
I
did
not
know
the
names
of
the
towns
that
I
was
to
pass
*NL*
through
,
nor
could
I
ask
information
from
a
single
human
being
;
but
I
*NL*
did
not
despair
.
From
you
only
could
I
hope
for
succour
,
although
*NL*
towards
you
I
felt
no
sentiment
but
that
of
hatred
.
Unfeeling
,
heartless
*NL*
creator
!
you
had
endowed
me
with
perceptions
and
passions
,
and
then
cast
*NL*
me
abroad
an
object
for
the
scorn
and
horror
of
mankind
.
But
on
you
only
*NL*
had
I
any
claim
for
pity
and
redress
,
and
from
you
I
determined
to
seek
*NL*
that
justice
which
I
vainly
attempted
to
gain
from
any
other
being
that
*NL*
wore
the
human
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
travels
were
long
,
and
the
sufferings
I
endured
intense
.
It
was
late
*NL*
in
autumn
when
I
quitted
the
district
where
I
had
so
long
resided
.
I
*NL*
travelled
only
at
night
,
fearful
of
encountering
the
visage
of
a
human
*NL*
being
.
Nature
decayed
around
me
,
and
the
sun
became
heatless
;
rain
and
*NL*
snow
poured
around
me
;
mighty
rivers
were
frozen
;
the
surface
of
the
*NL*
earth
was
hard
,
and
chill
,
and
bare
,
and
I
found
no
shelter
.
Oh
,
earth
!
*NL*
how
often
did
I
imprecate
curses
on
the
cause
of
my
being
!
The
mildness
*NL*
of
my
nature
had
fled
,
and
all
within
me
was
turned
to
gall
and
*NL*
bitterness
.
The
nearer
I
approached
to
your
habitation
,
the
more
deeply
*NL*
did
I
feel
the
spirit
of
revenge
enkindled
in
my
heart
.
Snow
fell
,
and
*NL*
the
waters
were
hardened
,
but
I
rested
not
.
A
few
incidents
now
and
then
*NL*
directed
me
,
and
I
possessed
a
map
of
the
country
;
but
I
often
wandered
*NL*
wide
from
my
path
.
The
agony
of
my
feelings
allowed
me
no
respite
:
no
*NL*
incident
occurred
from
which
my
rage
and
misery
could
not
extract
its
*NL*
food
;
but
a
circumstance
that
happened
when
I
arrived
on
the
confines
of
*NL*
Switzerland
,
when
the
sun
had
recovered
its
warmth
,
and
the
earth
again
*NL*
began
to
look
green
,
confirmed
in
an
especial
manner
the
bitterness
and
*NL*
horror
of
my
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
generally
rested
during
the
day
,
and
travelled
only
when
I
was
*NL*
secured
by
night
from
the
view
of
man
.
One
morning
,
however
,
finding
*NL*
that
my
path
lay
through
a
deep
wood
,
I
ventured
to
continue
my
journey
*NL*
after
the
sun
had
risen
;
the
day
,
which
was
one
of
the
first
of
spring
,
*NL*
cheered
even
me
by
the
loveliness
of
its
sunshine
and
the
balminess
of
*NL*
the
air
.
I
felt
emotions
of
gentleness
and
pleasure
,
that
had
long
*NL*
appeared
dead
,
revive
within
me
.
Half
surprised
by
the
novelty
of
these
*NL*
sensations
,
I
allowed
myself
to
be
borne
away
by
them
;
and
,
forgetting
*NL*
my
solitude
and
deformity
,
dared
to
be
happy
.
Soft
tears
again
bedewed
*NL*
my
cheeks
,
and
I
even
raised
my
humid
eyes
with
thankfulness
towards
the
*NL*
blessed
sun
which
bestowed
such
joy
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
continued
to
wind
among
the
paths
of
the
wood
,
until
I
came
to
its
*NL*
boundary
,
which
was
skirted
by
a
deep
and
rapid
river
,
into
which
many
*NL*
of
the
trees
bent
their
branches
,
now
budding
with
the
fresh
spring
.
*NL*
Here
I
paused
,
not
exactly
knowing
what
path
to
pursue
,
when
I
heard
the
*NL*
sound
of
voices
,
that
induced
me
to
conceal
myself
under
the
shade
of
a
*NL*
cypress
.
I
was
scarcely
hid
,
when
a
young
girl
came
running
towards
the
*NL*
spot
where
I
was
concealed
,
laughing
as
if
she
ran
from
some
one
in
*NL*
sport
.
She
continued
her
course
along
the
precipitous
sides
of
the
*NL*
river
,
when
suddenly
her
foot
slipt
,
and
she
fell
into
the
rapid
stream
.
*NL*
I
rushed
from
my
hiding
place
,
and
,
with
extreme
labour
from
the
force
*NL*
of
the
current
,
saved
her
,
and
dragged
her
to
shore
.
She
was
senseless
;
*NL*
and
I
endeavoured
,
by
every
means
in
my
power
,
to
restore
animation
,
*NL*
when
I
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
a
rustic
,
who
was
*NL*
probably
the
person
from
whom
she
had
playfully
fled
.
On
seeing
me
,
he
*NL*
darted
towards
me
,
and
,
tearing
the
girl
from
my
arms
,
hastened
towards
*NL*
the
deeper
parts
of
the
wood
.
I
followed
speedily
,
I
hardly
knew
why
;
*NL*
but
when
the
man
saw
me
draw
near
,
he
aimed
a
gun
,
which
he
carried
,
at
*NL*
my
body
,
and
fired
.
I
sunk
to
the
ground
,
and
my
injurer
,
with
increased
*NL*
swiftness
,
escaped
into
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
then
the
reward
of
my
benevolence
!
I
had
saved
a
human
being
*NL*
from
destruction
,
and
,
as
a
recompence
,
I
now
writhed
under
the
*NL*
miserable
pain
of
a
wound
,
which
shattered
the
flesh
and
bone
.
The
*NL*
feelings
of
kindness
and
gentleness
,
which
I
had
entertained
but
a
few
*NL*
moments
before
,
gave
place
to
hellish
rage
and
gnashing
of
teeth
.
*NL*
Inflamed
by
pain
,
I
vowed
eternal
hatred
and
vengeance
to
all
mankind
.
*NL*
But
the
agony
of
my
wound
overcame
me
;
my
pulses
paused
,
and
I
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
some
weeks
I
led
a
miserable
life
in
the
woods
,
endeavouring
to
*NL*
cure
the
wound
which
I
had
received
.
The
ball
had
entered
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
I
knew
not
whether
it
had
remained
there
or
passed
through
;
at
any
*NL*
rate
I
had
no
means
of
extracting
it
.
My
sufferings
were
augmented
also
*NL*
by
the
oppressive
sense
of
the
injustice
and
ingratitude
of
their
*NL*
infliction
.
My
daily
vows
rose
for
revenge
--
a
deep
and
deadly
revenge
,
*NL*
such
as
would
alone
compensate
for
the
outrages
and
anguish
I
had
*NL*
endured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
some
weeks
my
wound
healed
,
and
I
continued
my
journey
.
The
*NL*
labours
I
endured
were
no
longer
to
be
alleviated
by
the
bright
sun
or
*NL*
gentle
breezes
of
spring
;
all
joy
was
but
a
mockery
,
which
insulted
my
*NL*
desolate
state
,
and
made
me
feel
more
painfully
that
I
was
not
made
for
*NL*
the
enjoyment
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
toils
now
drew
near
a
close
and
,
two
months
from
this
time
,
I
*NL*
reached
the
environs
of
Geneva
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
evening
when
I
arrived
,
and
I
retired
to
a
hiding-place
among
*NL*
the
fields
that
surround
it
,
to
meditate
in
what
manner
I
should
apply
*NL*
to
you
.
I
was
oppressed
by
fatigue
and
hunger
,
and
far
too
unhappy
to
*NL*
enjoy
the
gentle
breezes
of
evening
,
or
the
prospect
of
the
sun
setting
*NL*
behind
the
stupendous
mountains
of
Jura
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
time
a
slight
sleep
relieved
me
from
the
pain
of
reflection
,
*NL*
which
was
disturbed
by
the
approach
of
a
beautiful
child
,
who
came
*NL*
running
into
the
recess
I
had
chosen
with
all
the
sportiveness
of
*NL*
infancy
.
Suddenly
,
as
I
gazed
on
him
,
an
idea
seized
me
,
that
this
*NL*
little
creature
was
unprejudiced
,
and
had
lived
too
short
a
time
to
have
*NL*
imbibed
a
horror
of
deformity
.
If
,
therefore
,
I
could
seize
him
,
and
*NL*
educate
him
as
my
companion
and
friend
,
I
should
not
be
so
desolate
in
*NL*
this
peopled
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Urged
by
this
impulse
,
I
seized
on
the
boy
as
he
passed
,
and
drew
him
*NL*
towards
me
.
As
soon
as
he
beheld
my
form
,
he
placed
his
hands
before
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
uttered
a
shrill
scream
:
I
drew
his
hand
forcibly
from
his
*NL*
face
,
and
said
,
`
Child
,
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
I
do
not
intend
to
*NL*
hurt
you
;
listen
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
struggled
violently
;
`
Let
me
go
,
'
he
cried
;
`
monster
!
ugly
wretch
!
*NL*
you
wish
to
eat
me
,
and
tear
me
to
pieces
--
You
are
an
ogre
--
Let
me
go
,
*NL*
or
I
will
tell
my
papa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Boy
,
you
will
never
see
your
father
again
;
you
must
come
with
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Hideous
monster
!
let
me
go
;
My
papa
is
a
Syndic
--
he
is
M.
*NL*
Frankenstein
--
he
would
punish
you
.
You
dare
not
keep
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Frankenstein
!
you
belong
then
to
my
enemy
--
to
him
towards
whom
I
have
*NL*
sworn
eternal
revenge
;
you
shall
be
my
first
victim
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
child
still
struggled
,
and
loaded
me
with
epithets
which
carried
*NL*
despair
to
my
heart
:
I
grasped
his
throat
to
silence
him
,
and
in
a
*NL*
moment
he
lay
dead
at
my
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gazed
on
my
victim
,
and
my
heart
swelled
with
exultation
and
hellish
*NL*
triumph
:
clapping
my
hands
,
I
exclaimed
,
`
I
,
too
,
can
create
desolation
;
*NL*
my
enemy
is
not
impregnable
;
this
death
will
carry
despair
to
him
,
and
a
*NL*
thousand
other
miseries
shall
torment
and
destroy
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
child
,
I
saw
something
glittering
on
his
*NL*
breast
.
I
took
it
;
it
was
a
portrait
of
a
most
lovely
woman
.
In
spite
of
*NL*
my
malignity
,
it
softened
and
attracted
me
.
For
a
few
moments
I
gazed
*NL*
with
delight
on
her
dark
eyes
,
fringed
by
deep
lashes
,
and
her
lovely
*NL*
lips
;
but
presently
my
rage
returned
:
I
remembered
that
I
was
for
ever
*NL*
deprived
of
the
delights
that
such
beautiful
creatures
could
bestow
;
and
*NL*
that
she
whose
resemblance
I
contemplated
would
,
in
regarding
me
,
have
*NL*
changed
that
air
of
divine
benignity
to
one
expressive
of
disgust
and
*NL*
affright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
wonder
that
such
thoughts
transported
me
with
rage
?
I
only
*NL*
wonder
that
at
that
moment
,
instead
of
venting
my
sensations
in
*NL*
exclamations
and
agony
,
I
did
not
rush
among
mankind
,
and
perish
in
the
*NL*
attempt
to
destroy
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
I
was
overcome
by
these
feelings
,
I
left
the
spot
where
I
had
*NL*
committed
the
murder
,
and
was
seeking
a
more
secluded
hiding-place
,
when
*NL*
I
perceived
a
woman
passing
near
me
.
She
was
young
,
not
indeed
so
*NL*
beautiful
as
her
whose
portrait
I
held
,
but
of
an
agreeable
aspect
,
and
*NL*
blooming
in
the
loveliness
of
youth
and
health
.
Here
,
I
thought
,
is
one
*NL*
of
those
whose
smiles
are
bestowed
on
all
but
me
;
she
shall
not
escape
:
*NL*
thanks
to
the
lessons
of
Felix
,
and
the
sanguinary
laws
of
man
,
I
have
*NL*
learned
how
to
work
mischief
.
I
approached
her
unperceived
,
and
placed
*NL*
the
portrait
securely
in
one
of
the
folds
of
her
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
some
days
I
haunted
the
spot
where
these
scenes
had
taken
place
;
*NL*
sometimes
wishing
to
see
you
,
sometimes
resolved
to
quit
the
world
and
*NL*
its
miseries
for
ever
.
At
length
I
wandered
towards
these
mountains
,
and
*NL*
have
ranged
through
their
immense
recesses
,
consumed
by
a
burning
*NL*
passion
which
you
alone
can
gratify
.
We
may
not
part
until
you
have
*NL*
promised
to
comply
with
my
requisition
.
I
am
alone
,
and
miserable
;
man
*NL*
will
not
associate
with
me
;
but
one
as
deformed
and
horrible
as
myself
*NL*
would
not
deny
herself
to
me
.
My
companion
must
be
of
the
same
species
,
*NL*
and
have
the
same
defects
.
This
being
you
must
create

CHAPTER
IX

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
being
finished
speaking
,
and
fixed
his
looks
upon
me
in
expectation
*NL*
of
a
reply
.
But
I
was
bewildered
,
perplexed
,
and
unable
to
arrange
my
*NL*
ideas
sufficiently
to
understand
the
full
extent
of
his
proposition
.
He
*NL*
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
create
a
female
for
me
,
with
whom
I
can
live
in
the
*NL*
interchange
of
those
sympathies
necessary
for
my
being
.
This
you
alone
*NL*
can
do
;
and
I
demand
it
of
you
as
a
right
which
you
must
not
refuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
part
of
his
tale
had
kindled
anew
in
me
the
anger
that
had
*NL*
died
away
while
he
narrated
his
peaceful
life
among
the
cottagers
,
and
,
*NL*
as
he
said
this
,
I
could
no
longer
suppress
the
rage
that
burned
within
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
refuse
it
,
''
I
replied
;
``
and
no
torture
shall
ever
extort
a
consent
*NL*
from
me
.
You
may
render
me
the
most
miserable
of
men
,
but
you
shall
*NL*
never
make
me
base
in
my
own
eyes
.
Shall
I
create
another
like
yourself
,
*NL*
whose
joint
wickedness
might
desolate
the
world
.
Begone
!
I
have
answered
*NL*
you
;
you
may
torture
me
,
but
I
will
never
consent

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
the
wrong
,
''
replied
the
fiend
;
``
and
,
instead
of
threatening
,
*NL*
I
am
content
to
reason
with
you
.
I
am
malicious
because
I
am
miserable
;
*NL*
am
I
not
shunned
and
hated
by
all
mankind
?
You
,
my
creator
,
would
tear
*NL*
me
to
pieces
,
and
triumph
;
remember
that
,
and
tell
me
why
I
should
pity
*NL*
man
more
than
he
pities
me
?
You
would
not
call
it
murder
,
if
you
could
*NL*
precipitate
me
into
one
of
those
ice-rifts
,
and
destroy
my
frame
,
the
*NL*
work
of
your
own
hands

Shall
I
respect
man
,
when
he
contemns
me
?
Let
*NL*
him
live
with
me
in
the
interchange
of
kindness

instead
of
injury

I
would
bestow
every
benefit
upon
him
with
tears
of
gratitude
at
his
*NL*
acceptance

But
that
can
not

the
human

are
insurmountable
*NL*
barriers
to
our
union

Yet
mine
shall
not

the
submission
of
abject
*NL*
slavery

I
will
revenge
my
injuries
:
if
I
can
not
inspire
love

cause
fear
;
and
chiefly
towards
you
my
arch-enemy
,
because
my
creator
,
*NL*
do
I
swear
inextinguishable
hatred
.
Have
a
care
:
I
will
work
at
your
*NL*
destruction
,
nor
finish
until
I
desolate
your
heart
,
so
that
you
curse
*NL*
the
hour
of
your
birth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fiendish
rage
animated
him
as
he
said
this
;
his
face
was
wrinkled
into
*NL*
contortions
too
horrible
for
human
eyes
to
behold
;
but
presently
he
*NL*
calmed
himself
,
and
proceeded
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
intended
to
reason
.
This
passion
is
detrimental
to
me
;
for
you
do
not
*NL*
reflect
that
you
are
the
cause
of
its
excess
.
If
any
being
felt
emotions
*NL*
of
benevolence
towards
me
,
I
should
return
them
an
hundred
and
an
*NL*
hundred
fold
;
for
that
one
creature
's
sake
,
I
would
make
peace
with
the
*NL*
whole
kind
!
But
I
now
indulge
in
dreams
of
bliss
that
can
not
be
*NL*
realized
.
What
I
ask
of
you
is
reasonable
and
moderate
;
I
demand
a
*NL*
creature
of
another
sex
,
but
as
hideous
as
myself
:
the
gratification
is
*NL*
small
,
but
it
is
all
that
I
can
receive
,
and
it
shall
content
me
.
It
is
*NL*
true
,
we
shall
be
monsters
,
cut
off
from
all
the
world
;
but
on
that
*NL*
account
we
shall
be
more
attached
to
one
another
.
Our
lives
will
not
be
*NL*
happy
,
but
they
will
be
harmless
,
and
free
from
the
misery
I
now
feel
.
*NL*
Oh
!
my
creator
,
make
me
happy
;
let
me
feel
gratitude
towards
you
for
one
*NL*
benefit
!
Let
me
see
that
I
excite
the
sympathy
of
some
existing
thing
;
*NL*
do
not
deny
me
my
request
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
moved
.
I
shuddered
when
I
thought
of
the
possible
consequences
of
*NL*
my
consent
;
but
I
felt
that
there
was
some
justice
in
his
argument
.
His
*NL*
tale
,
and
the
feelings
he
now
expressed
,
proved
him
to
be
a
creature
of
*NL*
fine
sensations
;
and
did
I
not
,
as
his
maker
,
owe
him
all
the
portion
of
*NL*
happiness
that
it
was
in
my
power
to
bestow
?
He
saw
my
change
of
*NL*
feeling
,
and
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
consent
,
neither
you
nor
any
other
human
being
shall
ever
see
us
*NL*
again
:
I
will
go
to
the
vast
wilds
of
South
America
.
My
food
is
not
that
*NL*
of
man
;
I
do
not
destroy
the
lamb
and
the
kid
,
to
glut
my
appetite
;
*NL*
acorns
and
berries
afford
me
sufficient
nourishment
.
My
companion
will
*NL*
be
of
the
same
nature
as
myself
,
and
will
be
content
with
the
same
fare
.
*NL*
We
shall
make
our
bed
of
dried
leaves
;
the
sun
will
shine
on
us
as
on
*NL*
man
,
and
will
ripen
our
food
.
The
picture
I
present
to
you
is
peaceful
*NL*
and
human
,
and
you
must
feel
that
you
could
deny
it
only
in
the
*NL*
wantonness
of
power
and
cruelty
.
Pitiless
as
you
have
been
towards
me
,
I
*NL*
now
see
compassion
in
your
eyes
:
let
me
seize
the
favourable
moment
,
and
*NL*
persuade
you
to
promise
what
I
so
ardently
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
propose
,
''
replied
I
,
``
to
fly
from
the
habitations
of
man
,
to
dwell
*NL*
in
those
wilds
where
the
beasts
of
the
field
will
be
your
only
*NL*
companions
.
How
can
you
,
who
long
for
the
love
and
sympathy
of
man
,
*NL*
persevere
in
this
exile
?
You
will
return
,
and
again
seek
their
kindness
,
*NL*
and
you
will
meet
with
their
detestation
;
your
evil
passions
will
be
*NL*
renewed
,
and
you
will
then
have
a
companion
to
aid
you
in
the
task
of
*NL*
destruction
.
This
may
not
be
;
cease
to
argue
the
point
,
for
I
can
not
*NL*
consent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
inconstant
are
your
feelings
!
but
a
moment
ago
you
were
moved
by
my
*NL*
representations
,
and
why
do
you
again
harden
yourself
to
my
complaints
?
*NL*
I
swear
to
you
,
by
the
earth
which
I
inhabit
,
and
by
you
that
made
me
,
*NL*
that
,
with
the
companion
you
bestow
,
I
will
quit
the
neighbourhood
of
*NL*
man
,
and
dwell
,
as
it
may
chance
,
in
the
most
savage
of
places
.
My
evil
*NL*
passions
will
have
fled
,
for
I
shall
meet
with
sympathy
;
my
life
will
*NL*
flow
quietly
away
,
and
,
in
my
dying
moments
,
I
shall
not
curse
my
*NL*
maker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
words
had
a
strange
effect
upon
me
.
I
compassionated
him
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
felt
a
wish
to
console
him
;
but
when
I
looked
upon
him
,
when
I
*NL*
saw
the
filthy
mass
that
moved
and
talked
,
my
heart
sickened
,
and
my
*NL*
feelings
were
altered
to
those
of
horror
and
hatred
.
I
tried
to
stifle
*NL*
these
sensations
;
I
thought
,
that
as
I
could
not
sympathize
with
him
,
I
*NL*
had
no
right
to
withhold
from
him
the
small
portion
of
happiness
which
*NL*
was
yet
in
my
power
to
bestow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
swear
,
''
I
said
,
``
to
be
harmless
;
but
have
you
not
already
shewn
a
*NL*
degree
of
malice
that
should
reasonably
make
me
distrust
you
?
May
not
*NL*
even
this
be
a
feint
that
will
increase
your
triumph
by
affording
a
*NL*
wider
scope
for
your
revenge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
this
?
I
thought
I
had
moved
your
compassion
,
and
yet
you
still
*NL*
refuse
to
bestow
on
me
the
only
benefit
that
can
soften
my
heart
,
and
*NL*
render
me
harmless
.
If
I
have
no
ties
and
no
affections
,
hatred
and
vice
*NL*
must
be
my
portion
;
the
love
of
another
will
destroy
the
cause
of
my
*NL*
crimes
,
and
I
shall
become
a
thing
,
of
whose
existence
every
one
will
be
*NL*
ignorant
.
My
vices
are
the
children
of
a
forced
solitude
that
I
abhor
;
*NL*
and
my
virtues
will
necessarily
arise
when
I
live
in
communion
with
an
*NL*
equal
.
I
shall
feel
the
affections
of
a
sensitive
being
,
and
become
*NL*
linked
to
the
chain
of
existence
and
events
,
from
which
I
am
now
*NL*
excluded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
paused
some
time
to
reflect
on
all
he
had
related
,
and
the
various
*NL*
arguments
which
he
had
employed
.
I
thought
of
the
promise
of
virtues
*NL*
which
he
had
displayed
on
the
opening
of
his
existence
,
and
the
*NL*
subsequent
blight
of
all
kindly
feeling
by
the
loathing
and
scorn
which
*NL*
his
protectors
had
manifested
towards
him
.
His
power
and
threats
were
*NL*
not
omitted
in
my
calculations
:
a
creature
who
could
exist
in
the
ice
*NL*
caves
of
the
glaciers
,
and
hide
himself
from
pursuit
among
the
ridges
of
*NL*
inaccessible
precipices
,
was
a
being
possessing
faculties
it
would
be
*NL*
vain
to
cope
with
.
After
a
long
pause
of
reflection
,
I
concluded
,
that
*NL*
the
justice
due
both
to
him
and
my
fellow-creatures
demanded
of
me
that
*NL*
I
should
comply
with
his
request
.
Turning
to
him
,
therefore
,
I
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consent
to
your
demand
,
on
your
solemn
oath
to
quit
Europe
for
ever
,
*NL*
and
every
other
place
in
the
neighbourhood
of
man
,
as
soon
as
I
shall
*NL*
deliver
into
your
hands
a
female
who
will
accompany
you
in
your
exile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
,
''
he
cried
,
``
by
the
sun
,
and
by
the
blue
sky
of
heaven
,
that
if
*NL*
you
grant
my
prayer
,
while
they
exist
you
shall
never
behold
me
again
.
*NL*
Depart
to
your
home
,
and
commence
your
labours
:
I
shall
watch
their
*NL*
progress
with
unutterable
anxiety
;
and
fear
not
but
that
when
you
are
*NL*
ready
I
shall
appear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Saying
this
,
he
suddenly
quitted
me
,
fearful
,
perhaps
,
of
any
change
in
*NL*
my
sentiments
.
I
saw
him
descend
the
mountain
with
greater
speed
than
*NL*
the
flight
of
an
eagle
,
and
quickly
lost
him
among
the
undulations
of
*NL*
the
sea
of
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tale
had
occupied
the
whole
day
;
and
the
sun
was
upon
the
verge
of
*NL*
the
horizon
when
he
departed
.
I
knew
that
I
ought
to
hasten
my
descent
*NL*
towards
the
valley
,
as
I
should
soon
be
encompassed
in
darkness
;
but
my
*NL*
heart
was
heavy
,
and
my
steps
slow
.
The
labour
of
winding
among
the
*NL*
little
paths
of
the
mountains
,
and
fixing
my
feet
firmly
as
I
advanced
,
*NL*
perplexed
me
,
occupied
as
I
was
by
the
emotions
which
the
occurrences
of
*NL*
the
day
had
produced
.
Night
was
far
advanced
,
when
I
came
to
the
*NL*
half-way
resting-place
,
and
seated
myself
beside
the
fountain
.
The
stars
*NL*
shone
at
intervals
,
as
the
clouds
passed
from
over
them
;
the
dark
pines
*NL*
rose
before
me
,
and
every
here
and
there
a
broken
tree
lay
on
the
*NL*
ground
:
it
was
a
scene
of
wonderful
solemnity
,
and
stirred
strange
*NL*
thoughts
within
me
.
I
wept
bitterly
;
and
,
clasping
my
hands
in
agony
,
I
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Oh
!
stars
,
and
clouds
,
and
winds
,
ye
are
all
about
to
mock
*NL*
me
:
if
ye
really
pity
me
,
crush
sensation
and
memory
;
let
me
become
as
*NL*
nought
;
but
if
not
,
depart
,
depart
and
leave
me
in
darkness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
wild
and
miserable
thoughts
;
but
I
can
not
describe
to
you
how
*NL*
the
eternal
twinkling
of
the
stars
weighed
upon
me
,
and
how
I
listened
*NL*
to
every
blast
of
wind
,
as
if
it
were
a
dull
ugly
siroc
on
its
way
to
*NL*
consume
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
dawned
before
I
arrived
at
the
village
of
Chamounix
;
but
my
*NL*
presence
,
so
haggard
and
strange
,
hardly
calmed
the
fears
of
my
family
,
*NL*
who
had
waited
the
whole
night
in
anxious
expectation
of
my
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
we
returned
to
Geneva
.
The
intention
of
my
father
in
*NL*
coming
had
been
to
divert
my
mind
,
and
to
restore
me
to
my
lost
*NL*
tranquillity
;
but
the
medicine
had
been
fatal
.
And
,
unable
to
account
*NL*
for
the
excess
of
misery
I
appeared
to
suffer
,
he
hastened
to
return
*NL*
home
,
hoping
the
quiet
and
monotony
of
a
domestic
life
would
by
degrees
*NL*
alleviate
my
sufferings
from
whatsoever
cause
they
might
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
myself
,
I
was
passive
in
all
their
arrangements
;
and
the
gentle
*NL*
affection
of
my
beloved
Elizabeth
was
inadequate
to
draw
me
from
the
*NL*
depth
of
my
despair
.
The
promise
I
had
made
to
the
daemon
weighed
upon
my
*NL*
mind
,
like
Dante
's
iron
cowl
on
the
heads
of
the
hellish
hypocrites
.
All
*NL*
pleasures
of
earth
and
sky
passed
before
me
like
a
dream
,
and
that
*NL*
thought
only
had
to
me
the
reality
of
life
.
Can
you
wonder
,
that
*NL*
sometimes
a
kind
of
insanity
possessed
me
,
or
that
I
saw
continually
*NL*
about
me
a
multitude
of
filthy
animals
inflicting
on
me
incessant
*NL*
torture
,
that
often
extorted
screams
and
bitter
groans
?
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
,
however
,
these
feelings
became
calmed
.
I
entered
again
into
*NL*
the
every-day
scene
of
life
,
if
not
with
interest
,
at
least
with
some
*NL*
degree
of
tranquillity
.

CHAPTER
I.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Day
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
passed
away
on
my
return
to
Geneva
;
and
*NL*
I
could
not
collect
the
courage
to
recommence
my
work
.
I
feared
the
*NL*
vengeance
of
the
disappointed
fiend
,
yet
I
was
unable
to
overcome
my
*NL*
repugnance
to
the
task
which
was
enjoined
me
.
I
found
that
I
could
not
*NL*
compose
a
female
without
again
devoting
several
months
to
profound
study
*NL*
and
laborious
disquisition
.
I
had
heard
of
some
discoveries
having
been
*NL*
made
by
an
English
philosopher
,
the
knowledge
of
which
was
material
to
*NL*
my
success
,
and
I
sometimes
thought
of
obtaining
my
father
's
consent
to
*NL*
visit
England
for
this
purpose
;
but
I
clung
to
every
pretence
of
delay
,
*NL*
and
could
not
resolve
to
interrupt
my
returning
tranquillity
.
My
health
,
*NL*
which
had
hitherto
declined
,
was
now
much
restored
;
and
my
spirits
,
when
*NL*
unchecked
by
the
memory
of
my
unhappy
promise
,
rose
proportionably
.
My
*NL*
father
saw
this
change
with
pleasure
,
and
he
turned
his
thoughts
towards
*NL*
the
best
method
of
eradicating
the
remains
of
my
melancholy
,
which
*NL*
every
now
and
then
would
return
by
fits
,
and
with
a
devouring
blackness
*NL*
overcast
the
approaching
sunshine
.
At
these
moments
I
took
refuge
in
the
*NL*
most
perfect
solitude
.
I
passed
whole
days
on
the
lake
alone
in
a
little
*NL*
boat
,
watching
the
clouds
,
and
listening
to
the
rippling
of
the
waves
,
*NL*
silent
and
listless
.
But
the
fresh
air
and
bright
sun
seldom
failed
to
*NL*
restore
me
to
some
degree
of
composure
;
and
,
on
my
return
,
I
met
the
*NL*
salutations
of
my
friends
with
a
readier
smile
and
a
more
cheerful
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
my
return
from
one
of
these
rambles
that
my
father
,
calling
*NL*
me
aside
,
thus
addressed
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
happy
to
remark
,
my
dear
son
,
that
you
have
resumed
your
former
*NL*
pleasures
,
and
seem
to
be
returning
to
yourself
.
And
yet
you
are
still
*NL*
unhappy
,
and
still
avoid
our
society
.
For
some
time
I
was
lost
in
*NL*
conjecture
as
to
the
cause
of
this
;
but
yesterday
an
idea
struck
me
,
and
*NL*
if
it
is
well
founded
,
I
conjure
you
to
avow
it
.
Reserve
on
such
a
point
*NL*
would
be
not
only
useless
,
but
draw
down
treble
misery
on
us
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
violently
at
this
exordium
,
and
my
father
continued
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
my
son
,
that
I
have
always
looked
forward
to
your
marriage
*NL*
with
your
cousin
as
the
tie
of
our
domestic
comfort
,
and
the
stay
of
my
*NL*
declining
years
.
You
were
attached
to
each
other
from
your
earliest
*NL*
infancy
;
you
studied
together
,
and
appeared
,
in
dispositions
and
tastes
,
*NL*
entirely
suited
to
one
another
.
But
so
blind
is
the
experience
of
man
,
*NL*
that
what
I
conceived
to
be
the
best
assistants
to
my
plan
may
have
*NL*
entirely
destroyed
it
.
You
,
perhaps
,
regard
her
as
your
sister
,
without
*NL*
any
wish
that
she
might
become
your
wife
.
Nay
,
you
may
have
met
with
*NL*
another
whom
you
may
love
;
and
,
considering
yourself
as
bound
in
honour
*NL*
to
your
cousin
,
this
struggle
may
occasion
the
poignant
misery
which
you
*NL*
appear
to
feel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
father
,
re-assure
yourself
.
I
love
my
cousin
tenderly
and
*NL*
sincerely
.
I
never
saw
any
woman
who
excited
,
as
Elizabeth
does
,
my
*NL*
warmest
admiration
and
affection
.
My
future
hopes
and
prospects
are
*NL*
entirely
bound
up
in
the
expectation
of
our
union
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
expression
of
your
sentiments
on
this
subject
,
my
dear
Victor
,
*NL*
gives
me
more
pleasure
than
I
have
for
some
time
experienced
.
If
you
*NL*
feel
thus
,
we
shall
assuredly
be
happy
,
however
present
events
may
cast
*NL*
a
gloom
over
us
.
But
it
is
this
gloom
,
which
appears
to
have
taken
so
*NL*
strong
a
hold
of
your
mind
,
that
I
wish
to
dissipate
.
Tell
me
,
*NL*
therefore
,
whether
you
object
to
an
immediate
solemnization
of
the
*NL*
marriage
.
We
have
been
unfortunate
,
and
recent
events
have
drawn
us
from
*NL*
that
every-day
tranquillity
befitting
my
years
and
infirmities
.
You
are
*NL*
younger
;
yet
I
do
not
suppose
,
possessed
as
you
are
of
a
competent
*NL*
fortune
,
that
an
early
marriage
would
at
all
interfere
with
any
future
*NL*
plans
of
honour
and
utility
that
you
may
have
formed
.
Do
not
suppose
,
*NL*
however
,
that
I
wish
to
dictate
happiness
to
you
,
or
that
a
delay
on
*NL*
your
part
would
cause
me
any
serious
uneasiness
.
Interpret
my
words
*NL*
with
candour
,
and
answer
me
,
I
conjure
you
,
with
confidence
and
*NL*
sincerity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
listened
to
my
father
in
silence
,
and
remained
for
some
time
incapable
*NL*
of
offering
any
reply
.
I
revolved
rapidly
in
my
mind
a
multitude
of
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
endeavoured
to
arrive
at
some
conclusion
.
Alas
!
to
me
the
*NL*
idea
of
an
immediate
union
with
my
cousin
was
one
of
horror
and
dismay
.
*NL*
I
was
bound
by
a
solemn
promise
,
which
I
had
not
yet
fulfilled
,
and
*NL*
dared
not
break
;
or
,
if
I
did
,
what
manifold
miseries
might
not
impend
*NL*
over
me
and
my
devoted
family
!
Could
I
enter
into
a
festival
with
this
*NL*
deadly
weight
yet
hanging
round
my
neck
,
and
bowing
me
to
the
ground
.
I
*NL*
must
perform
my
engagement
,
and
let
the
monster
depart
with
his
mate
,
*NL*
before
I
allowed
myself
to
enjoy
the
delight
of
an
union
from
which
I
*NL*
expected
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remembered
also
the
necessity
imposed
upon
me
of
either
journeying
to
*NL*
England
,
or
entering
into
a
long
correspondence
with
those
philosophers
*NL*
of
that
country
,
whose
knowledge
and
discoveries
were
of
indispensable
*NL*
use
to
me
in
my
present
undertaking
.
The
latter
method
of
obtaining
the
*NL*
desired
intelligence
was
dilatory
and
unsatisfactory
:
besides
,
any
*NL*
variation
was
agreeable
to
me
,
and
I
was
delighted
with
the
idea
of
*NL*
spending
a
year
or
two
in
change
of
scene
and
variety
of
occupation
,
in
*NL*
absence
from
my
family
;
during
which
period
some
event
might
happen
*NL*
which
would
restore
me
to
them
in
peace
and
happiness
:
my
promise
might
*NL*
be
fulfilled
,
and
the
monster
have
departed
;
or
some
accident
might
*NL*
occur
to
destroy
him
,
and
put
an
end
to
my
slavery
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
feelings
dictated
my
answer
to
my
father
.
I
expressed
a
wish
to
*NL*
visit
England
;
but
,
concealing
the
true
reasons
of
this
request
,
I
*NL*
clothed
my
desires
under
the
guise
of
wishing
to
travel
and
see
the
*NL*
world
before
I
sat
down
for
life
within
the
walls
of
my
native
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
urged
my
entreaty
with
earnestness
,
and
my
father
was
easily
induced
*NL*
to
comply
;
for
a
more
indulgent
and
less
dictatorial
parent
did
not
*NL*
exist
upon
earth
.
Our
plan
was
soon
arranged
.
I
should
travel
to
*NL*
Strasburgh
,
where
Clerval
would
join
me
.
Some
short
time
would
be
spent
*NL*
in
the
towns
of
Holland
,
and
our
principal
stay
would
be
in
England
.
We
*NL*
should
return
by
France
;
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
tour
should
occupy
*NL*
the
space
of
two
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
pleased
himself
with
the
reflection
,
that
my
union
with
*NL*
Elizabeth
should
take
place
immediately
on
my
return
to
Geneva
.
``
These
*NL*
two
years
,
''
said
he
,
``
will
pass
swiftly
,
and
it
will
be
the
last
delay
*NL*
that
will
oppose
itself
to
your
happiness
.
And
,
indeed
,
I
earnestly
*NL*
desire
that
period
to
arrive
,
when
we
shall
all
be
united
,
and
neither
*NL*
hopes
or
fears
arise
to
disturb
our
domestic
calm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
content
,
''
I
replied
,
``
with
your
arrangement
.
By
that
time
we
shall
*NL*
both
have
become
wiser
,
and
I
hope
happier
,
than
we
at
present
are
.
''
I
*NL*
sighed
;
but
my
father
kindly
forbore
to
question
me
further
concerning
*NL*
the
cause
of
my
dejection
.
He
hoped
that
new
scenes
,
and
the
amusement
*NL*
of
travelling
,
would
restore
my
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
made
arrangements
for
my
journey
;
but
one
feeling
haunted
me
,
*NL*
which
filled
me
with
fear
and
agitation
.
During
my
absence
I
should
*NL*
leave
my
friends
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
their
enemy
,
and
*NL*
unprotected
from
his
attacks
,
exasperated
as
he
might
be
by
my
*NL*
departure
.
But
he
had
promised
to
follow
me
wherever
I
might
go
;
and
*NL*
would
he
not
accompany
me
to
England
?
This
imagination
was
dreadful
in
*NL*
itself
,
but
soothing
,
inasmuch
as
it
supposed
the
safety
of
my
friends
.
*NL*
I
was
agonized
with
the
idea
of
the
possibility
that
the
reverse
of
this
*NL*
might
happen
.
But
through
the
whole
period
during
which
I
was
the
slave
*NL*
of
my
creature
,
I
allowed
myself
to
be
governed
by
the
impulses
of
the
*NL*
moment
;
and
my
present
sensations
strongly
intimated
that
the
fiend
*NL*
would
follow
me
,
and
exempt
my
family
from
the
danger
of
his
*NL*
machinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
latter
end
of
August
that
I
departed
,
to
pass
two
years
of
*NL*
exile
.
Elizabeth
approved
of
the
reasons
of
my
departure
,
and
only
*NL*
regretted
that
she
had
not
the
same
opportunities
of
enlarging
her
*NL*
experience
,
and
cultivating
her
understanding
.
She
wept
,
however
,
as
she
*NL*
bade
me
farewell
,
and
entreated
me
to
return
happy
and
tranquil
.
``
We
*NL*
all
,
''
said
she
,
``
depend
upon
you
;
and
if
you
are
miserable
,
what
must
be
*NL*
our
feelings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
threw
myself
into
the
carriage
that
was
to
convey
me
away
,
hardly
*NL*
knowing
whither
I
was
going
,
and
careless
of
what
was
passing
around
.
I
*NL*
remembered
only
,
and
it
was
with
a
bitter
anguish
that
I
reflected
on
*NL*
it
,
to
order
that
my
chemical
instruments
should
be
packed
to
go
with
*NL*
me
:
for
I
resolved
to
fulfil
my
promise
while
abroad
,
and
return
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
a
free
man
.
Filled
with
dreary
imaginations
,
I
passed
through
*NL*
many
beautiful
and
majestic
scenes
;
but
my
eyes
were
fixed
and
*NL*
unobserving
.
I
could
only
think
of
the
bourne
of
my
travels
,
and
the
*NL*
work
which
was
to
occupy
me
whilst
they
endured
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
days
spent
in
listless
indolence
,
during
which
I
traversed
*NL*
many
leagues
,
I
arrived
at
Strasburgh
,
where
I
waited
two
days
for
*NL*
Clerval
.
He
came
.
Alas
,
how
great
was
the
contrast
between
us
!
He
was
*NL*
alive
to
every
new
scene
;
joyful
when
he
saw
the
beauties
of
the
setting
*NL*
sun
,
and
more
happy
when
he
beheld
it
rise
,
and
recommence
a
new
day
.
He
*NL*
pointed
out
to
me
the
shifting
colours
of
the
landscape
,
and
the
*NL*
appearances
of
the
sky
.
``
This
is
what
it
is
to
live
;
''
he
cried
,
``
now
I
*NL*
enjoy
existence
!
But
you
,
my
dear
Frankenstein
,
wherefore
are
you
*NL*
desponding
and
sorrowful
?
''
In
truth
,
I
was
occupied
by
gloomy
thoughts
,
*NL*
and
neither
saw
the
descent
of
the
evening
star
,
nor
the
golden
sun-rise
*NL*
reflected
in
the
Rhine
.
--
And
you
,
my
friend
,
would
be
far
more
amused
*NL*
with
the
journal
of
Clerval
,
who
observed
the
scenery
with
an
eye
of
*NL*
feeling
and
delight
,
than
to
listen
to
my
reflections
.
I
,
a
miserable
*NL*
wretch
,
haunted
by
a
curse
that
shut
up
every
avenue
to
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
agreed
to
descend
the
Rhine
in
a
boat
from
Strasburgh
to
*NL*
Rotterdam
,
whence
we
might
take
shipping
for
London
.
During
this
voyage
,
*NL*
we
passed
by
many
willowy
islands
,
and
saw
several
beautiful
towns
.
We
*NL*
staid
a
day
at
Manheim
,
and
,
on
the
fifth
from
our
departure
from
*NL*
Strasburgh
,
arrived
at
Mayence
.
The
course
of
the
Rhine
below
Mayence
*NL*
becomes
much
more
picturesque
.
The
river
descends
rapidly
,
and
winds
*NL*
between
hills
,
not
high
,
but
steep
,
and
of
beautiful
forms
.
We
saw
many
*NL*
ruined
castles
standing
on
the
edges
of
precipices
,
surrounded
by
black
*NL*
woods
,
high
and
inaccessible
.
This
part
of
the
Rhine
,
indeed
,
presents
a
*NL*
singularly
variegated
landscape
.
In
one
spot
you
view
rugged
hills
,
*NL*
ruined
castles
overlooking
tremendous
precipices
,
with
the
dark
Rhine
*NL*
rushing
beneath
;
and
,
on
the
sudden
turn
of
a
promontory
,
flourishing
*NL*
vineyards
,
with
green
sloping
banks
,
and
a
meandering
river
,
and
*NL*
populous
towns
,
occupy
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
travelled
at
the
time
of
the
vintage
,
and
heard
the
song
of
the
*NL*
labourers
,
as
we
glided
down
the
stream
.
Even
I
,
depressed
in
mind
,
and
*NL*
my
spirits
continually
agitated
by
gloomy
feelings
,
even
I
was
pleased
.
*NL*
I
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
,
as
I
gazed
on
the
cloudless
blue
*NL*
sky
,
I
seemed
to
drink
in
a
tranquillity
to
which
I
had
long
been
a
*NL*
stranger
.
And
if
these
were
my
sensations
,
who
can
describe
those
of
*NL*
Henry
?
He
felt
as
if
he
had
been
transported
to
Fairy-land
,
and
enjoyed
*NL*
a
happiness
seldom
tasted
by
man
.
``
I
have
seen
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
most
*NL*
beautiful
scenes
of
my
own
country
;
I
have
visited
the
lakes
of
Lucerne
*NL*
and
Uri
,
where
the
snowy
mountains
descend
almost
perpendicularly
to
the
*NL*
water
,
casting
black
and
impenetrable
shades
,
which
would
cause
a
gloomy
*NL*
and
mournful
appearance
,
were
it
not
for
the
most
verdant
islands
that
*NL*
relieve
the
eye
by
their
gay
appearance
;
I
have
seen
this
lake
agitated
*NL*
by
a
tempest
,
when
the
wind
tore
up
whirlwinds
of
water
,
and
gave
you
an
*NL*
idea
of
what
the
water-spout
must
be
on
the
great
ocean
,
and
the
waves
*NL*
dash
with
fury
the
base
of
the
mountain
,
where
the
priest
and
his
*NL*
mistress
were
overwhelmed
by
an
avalanche
,
and
where
their
dying
voices
*NL*
are
still
said
to
be
heard
amid
the
pauses
of
the
nightly
wind
;
I
have
*NL*
seen
the
mountains
of
La
Valais
,
and
the
Pays
de
Vaud
:
but
this
country
,
*NL*
Victor
,
pleases
me
more
than
all
those
wonders
.
The
mountains
of
*NL*
Switzerland
are
more
majestic
and
strange
;
but
there
is
a
charm
in
the
*NL*
banks
of
this
divine
river
,
that
I
never
before
saw
equalled
.
Look
at
*NL*
that
castle
which
overhangs
yon
precipice
;
and
that
also
on
the
island
,
*NL*
almost
concealed
amongst
the
foliage
of
those
lovely
trees
;
and
now
that
*NL*
group
of
labourers
coming
from
among
their
vines
;
and
that
village
*NL*
half-hid
in
the
recess
of
the
mountain
.
Oh
,
surely
,
the
spirit
that
*NL*
inhabits
and
guards
this
place
has
a
soul
more
in
harmony
with
man
,
than
*NL*
those
who
pile
the
glacier
,
or
retire
to
the
inaccessible
peaks
of
the
*NL*
mountains
of
our
own
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clerval
!
beloved
friend
!
even
now
it
delights
me
to
record
your
words
,
*NL*
and
to
dwell
on
the
praise
of
which
you
are
so
eminently
deserving
.
He
*NL*
was
a
being
formed
in
the
``
very
poetry
of
nature
.
''
His
wild
and
*NL*
enthusiastic
imagination
was
chastened
by
the
sensibility
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
His
soul
overflowed
with
ardent
affections
,
and
his
friendship
was
of
*NL*
that
devoted
and
wondrous
nature
that
the
worldly-minded
teach
us
to
*NL*
look
for
only
in
the
imagination
.
But
even
human
sympathies
were
not
*NL*
sufficient
to
satisfy
his
eager
mind
.
The
scenery
of
external
nature
,
*NL*
which
others
regard
only
with
admiration
,
he
loved
with
ardour
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
--
``
The
sounding
cataract
*NL*
Haunted
_
him
_
like
a
passion
:
the
tall
rock
,
*NL*
The
mountain
,
and
the
deep
and
gloomy
wood
,
*NL*
Their
colours
and
their
forms
,
were
then
to
him
*NL*
An
appetite
;
a
feeling
,
and
a
love
,
*NL*
That
had
no
need
of
a
remoter
charm
,
*NL*
By
thought
supplied
,
or
any
interest
*NL*
Unborrowed
from
the
eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
where
does
he
now
exist
?
Is
this
gentle
and
lovely
being
lost
for
*NL*
ever
?
Has
this
mind
so
replete
with
ideas
,
imaginations
fanciful
and
*NL*
magnificent
,
which
formed
a
world
,
whose
existence
depended
on
the
life
*NL*
of
its
creator
;
has
this
mind
perished
?
Does
it
now
only
exist
in
my
*NL*
memory
?
No
,
it
is
not
thus
;
your
form
so
divinely
wrought
,
and
beaming
*NL*
with
beauty
,
has
decayed
,
but
your
spirit
still
visits
and
consoles
your
*NL*
unhappy
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pardon
this
gush
of
sorrow
;
these
ineffectual
words
are
but
a
slight
*NL*
tribute
to
the
unexampled
worth
of
Henry
,
but
they
soothe
my
heart
,
*NL*
overflowing
with
the
anguish
which
his
remembrance
creates
.
I
will
*NL*
proceed
with
my
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
Cologne
we
descended
to
the
plains
of
Holland
;
and
we
resolved
to
*NL*
post
the
remainder
of
our
way
;
for
the
wind
was
contrary
,
and
the
stream
*NL*
of
the
river
was
too
gentle
to
aid
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
journey
here
lost
the
interest
arising
from
beautiful
scenery
;
but
*NL*
we
arrived
in
a
few
days
at
Rotterdam
,
whence
we
proceeded
by
sea
to
*NL*
England
.
It
was
on
a
clear
morning
,
in
the
latter
days
of
December
,
that
*NL*
I
first
saw
the
white
cliffs
of
Britain
.
The
banks
of
the
Thames
*NL*
presented
a
new
scene
;
they
were
flat
,
but
fertile
,
and
almost
every
*NL*
town
was
marked
by
the
remembrance
of
some
story
.
We
saw
Tilbury
Fort
,
*NL*
and
remembered
the
Spanish
armada
;
Gravesend
,
Woolwich
,
and
Greenwich
,
*NL*
places
which
I
had
heard
of
even
in
my
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
we
saw
the
numerous
steeples
of
London
,
St.
Paul
's
towering
*NL*
above
all
,
and
the
Tower
famed
in
English
history
.

CHAPTER
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
London
was
our
present
point
of
rest
;
we
determined
to
remain
several
*NL*
months
in
this
wonderful
and
celebrated
city
.
Clerval
desired
the
*NL*
intercourse
of
the
men
of
genius
and
talent
who
flourished
at
this
time
;
*NL*
but
this
was
with
me
a
secondary
object
;
I
was
principally
occupied
with
*NL*
the
means
of
obtaining
the
information
necessary
for
the
completion
of
*NL*
my
promise
,
and
quickly
availed
myself
of
the
letters
of
introduction
*NL*
that
I
had
brought
with
me
,
addressed
to
the
most
distinguished
natural
*NL*
philosophers
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
this
journey
had
taken
place
during
my
days
of
study
and
happiness
,
*NL*
it
would
have
afforded
me
inexpressible
pleasure
.
But
a
blight
had
come
*NL*
over
my
existence
,
and
I
only
visited
these
people
for
the
sake
of
the
*NL*
information
they
might
give
me
on
the
subject
in
which
my
interest
was
*NL*
so
terribly
profound
.
Company
was
irksome
to
me
;
when
alone
,
I
could
*NL*
fill
my
mind
with
the
sights
of
heaven
and
earth
;
the
voice
of
Henry
*NL*
soothed
me
,
and
I
could
thus
cheat
myself
into
a
transitory
peace
.
But
*NL*
busy
uninteresting
joyous
faces
brought
back
despair
to
my
heart
.
I
saw
*NL*
an
insurmountable
barrier
placed
between
me
and
my
fellow-men
;
this
*NL*
barrier
was
sealed
with
the
blood
of
William
and
Justine
;
and
to
reflect
*NL*
on
the
events
connected
with
those
names
filled
my
soul
with
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
Clerval
I
saw
the
image
of
my
former
self
;
he
was
inquisitive
,
*NL*
and
anxious
to
gain
experience
and
instruction
.
The
difference
of
*NL*
manners
which
he
observed
was
to
him
an
inexhaustible
source
of
*NL*
instruction
and
amusement
.
He
was
for
ever
busy
;
and
the
only
check
to
*NL*
his
enjoyments
was
my
sorrowful
and
dejected
mien
.
I
tried
to
conceal
*NL*
this
as
much
as
possible
,
that
I
might
not
debar
him
from
the
pleasures
*NL*
natural
to
one
who
was
entering
on
a
new
scene
of
life
,
undisturbed
by
*NL*
any
care
or
bitter
recollection
.
I
often
refused
to
accompany
him
,
*NL*
alleging
another
engagement
,
that
I
might
remain
alone
.
I
now
also
began
*NL*
to
collect
the
materials
necessary
for
my
new
creation
,
and
this
was
to
*NL*
me
like
the
torture
of
single
drops
of
water
continually
falling
on
the
*NL*
head
.
Every
thought
that
was
devoted
to
it
was
an
extreme
anguish
,
and
*NL*
every
word
that
I
spoke
in
allusion
to
it
caused
my
lips
to
quiver
,
and
*NL*
my
heart
to
palpitate
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
passing
some
months
in
London
,
we
received
a
letter
from
a
person
*NL*
in
Scotland
,
who
had
formerly
been
our
visitor
at
Geneva
.
He
mentioned
*NL*
the
beauties
of
his
native
country
,
and
asked
us
if
those
were
not
*NL*
sufficient
allurements
to
induce
us
to
prolong
our
journey
as
far
north
*NL*
as
Perth
,
where
he
resided
.
Clerval
eagerly
desired
to
accept
this
*NL*
invitation
;
and
I
,
although
I
abhorred
society
,
wished
to
view
again
*NL*
mountains
and
streams
,
and
all
the
wondrous
works
with
which
Nature
*NL*
adorns
her
chosen
dwelling-places
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
arrived
in
England
at
the
beginning
of
October
,
and
it
was
now
*NL*
February
.
We
accordingly
determined
to
commence
our
journey
towards
the
*NL*
north
at
the
expiration
of
another
month
.
In
this
expedition
we
did
not
*NL*
intend
to
follow
the
great
road
to
Edinburgh
,
but
to
visit
Windsor
,
*NL*
Oxford
,
Matlock
,
and
the
Cumberland
lakes
,
resolving
to
arrive
at
the
*NL*
completion
of
this
tour
about
the
end
of
July
.
I
packed
my
chemical
*NL*
instruments
,
and
the
materials
I
had
collected
,
resolving
to
finish
my
*NL*
labours
in
some
obscure
nook
in
the
northern
highlands
of
Scotland
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
quitted
London
on
the
27th
of
March
,
and
remained
a
few
days
at
*NL*
Windsor
,
rambling
in
its
beautiful
forest
.
This
was
a
new
scene
to
us
*NL*
mountaineers
;
the
majestic
oaks
,
the
quantity
of
game
,
and
the
herds
of
*NL*
stately
deer
,
were
all
novelties
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
thence
we
proceeded
to
Oxford
.
As
we
entered
this
city
,
our
minds
*NL*
were
filled
with
the
remembrance
of
the
events
that
had
been
transacted
*NL*
there
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
before
.
It
was
here
that
Charles
I.
*NL*
had
collected
his
forces
.
This
city
had
remained
faithful
to
him
,
after
*NL*
the
whole
nation
had
forsaken
his
cause
to
join
the
standard
of
*NL*
parliament
and
liberty
.
The
memory
of
that
unfortunate
king
,
and
his
*NL*
companions
,
the
amiable
Falkland
,
the
insolent
Gower
,
his
queen
,
and
*NL*
son
,
gave
a
peculiar
interest
to
every
part
of
the
city
,
which
they
*NL*
might
be
supposed
to
have
inhabited
.
The
spirit
of
elder
days
found
a
*NL*
dwelling
here
,
and
we
delighted
to
trace
its
footsteps
.
If
these
*NL*
feelings
had
not
found
an
imaginary
gratification
,
the
appearance
of
the
*NL*
city
had
yet
in
itself
sufficient
beauty
to
obtain
our
admiration
.
The
*NL*
colleges
are
ancient
and
picturesque
;
the
streets
are
almost
*NL*
magnificent
;
and
the
lovely
Isis
,
which
flows
beside
it
through
meadows
*NL*
of
exquisite
verdure
,
is
spread
forth
into
a
placid
expanse
of
waters
,
*NL*
which
reflects
its
majestic
assemblage
of
towers
,
and
spires
,
and
domes
,
*NL*
embosomed
among
aged
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
enjoyed
this
scene
;
and
yet
my
enjoyment
was
embittered
both
by
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
past
,
and
the
anticipation
of
the
future
.
I
was
formed
for
*NL*
peaceful
happiness
.
During
my
youthful
days
discontent
never
visited
my
*NL*
mind
;
and
if
I
was
ever
overcome
by
_
ennui
_
,
the
sight
of
what
is
*NL*
beautiful
in
nature
,
or
the
study
of
what
is
excellent
and
sublime
in
*NL*
the
productions
of
man
,
could
always
interest
my
heart
,
and
communicate
*NL*
elasticity
to
my
spirits
.
But
I
am
a
blasted
tree
;
the
bolt
has
entered
*NL*
my
soul
;
and
I
felt
then
that
I
should
survive
to
exhibit
,
what
I
shall
*NL*
soon
cease
to
be
--
a
miserable
spectacle
of
wrecked
humanity
,
pitiable
to
*NL*
others
,
and
abhorrent
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
passed
a
considerable
period
at
Oxford
,
rambling
among
its
environs
,
*NL*
and
endeavouring
to
identify
every
spot
which
might
relate
to
the
most
*NL*
animating
epoch
of
English
history
.
Our
little
voyages
of
discovery
were
*NL*
often
prolonged
by
the
successive
objects
that
presented
themselves
.
We
*NL*
visited
the
tomb
of
the
illustrious
Hampden
,
and
the
field
on
which
that
*NL*
patriot
fell
.
For
a
moment
my
soul
was
elevated
from
its
debasing
and
*NL*
miserable
fears
to
contemplate
the
divine
ideas
of
liberty
and
*NL*
self-sacrifice
,
of
which
these
sights
were
the
monuments
and
the
*NL*
remembrancers
.
For
an
instant
I
dared
to
shake
off
my
chains
,
and
look
*NL*
around
me
with
a
free
and
lofty
spirit
;
but
the
iron
had
eaten
into
my
*NL*
flesh
,
and
I
sank
again
,
trembling
and
hopeless
,
into
my
miserable
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
Oxford
with
regret
,
and
proceeded
to
Matlock
,
which
was
our
next
*NL*
place
of
rest
.
The
country
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
village
*NL*
resembled
,
to
a
greater
degree
,
the
scenery
of
Switzerland
;
but
every
*NL*
thing
is
on
a
lower
scale
,
and
the
green
hills
want
the
crown
of
distant
*NL*
white
Alps
,
which
always
attend
on
the
piny
mountains
of
my
native
*NL*
country
.
We
visited
the
wondrous
cave
,
and
the
little
cabinets
of
*NL*
natural
history
,
where
the
curiosities
are
disposed
in
the
same
manner
*NL*
as
in
the
collections
at
Servox
and
Chamounix
.
The
latter
name
made
me
*NL*
tremble
,
when
pronounced
by
Henry
;
and
I
hastened
to
quit
Matlock
,
with
*NL*
which
that
terrible
scene
was
thus
associated
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Derby
still
journeying
northward
,
we
passed
two
months
in
*NL*
Cumberland
and
Westmoreland
.
I
could
now
almost
fancy
myself
among
the
*NL*
Swiss
mountains
.
The
little
patches
of
snow
which
yet
lingered
on
the
*NL*
northern
sides
of
the
mountains
,
the
lakes
,
and
the
dashing
of
the
rocky
*NL*
streams
,
were
all
familiar
and
dear
sights
to
me
.
Here
also
we
made
some
*NL*
acquaintances
,
who
almost
contrived
to
cheat
me
into
happiness
.
The
*NL*
delight
of
Clerval
was
proportionably
greater
than
mine
;
his
mind
*NL*
expanded
in
the
company
of
men
of
talent
,
and
he
found
in
his
own
nature
*NL*
greater
capacities
and
resources
than
he
could
have
imagined
himself
to
*NL*
have
possessed
while
he
associated
with
his
inferiors
.
``
I
could
pass
my
*NL*
life
here
,
''
said
he
to
me
;
``
and
among
these
mountains
I
should
scarcely
*NL*
regret
Switzerland
and
the
Rhine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
found
that
a
traveller
's
life
is
one
that
includes
much
pain
*NL*
amidst
its
enjoyments
.
His
feelings
are
for
ever
on
the
stretch
;
and
*NL*
when
he
begins
to
sink
into
repose
,
he
finds
himself
obliged
to
quit
*NL*
that
on
which
he
rests
in
pleasure
for
something
new
,
which
again
*NL*
engages
his
attention
,
and
which
also
he
forsakes
for
other
novelties
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
scarcely
visited
the
various
lakes
of
Cumberland
and
*NL*
Westmoreland
,
and
conceived
an
affection
for
some
of
the
inhabitants
,
*NL*
when
the
period
of
our
appointment
with
our
Scotch
friend
approached
,
*NL*
and
we
left
them
to
travel
on
.
For
my
own
part
I
was
not
sorry
.
I
had
*NL*
now
neglected
my
promise
for
some
time
,
and
I
feared
the
effects
of
the
*NL*
daemon
's
disappointment
.
He
might
remain
in
Switzerland
,
and
wreak
his
*NL*
vengeance
on
my
relatives
.
This
idea
pursued
me
,
and
tormented
me
at
*NL*
every
moment
from
which
I
might
otherwise
have
snatched
repose
and
*NL*
peace
.
I
waited
for
my
letters
with
feverish
impatience
:
if
they
were
*NL*
delayed
,
I
was
miserable
,
and
overcome
by
a
thousand
fears
;
and
when
*NL*
they
arrived
,
and
I
saw
the
superscription
of
Elizabeth
or
my
father
,
I
*NL*
hardly
dared
to
read
and
ascertain
my
fate
.
Sometimes
I
thought
that
the
*NL*
fiend
followed
me
,
and
might
expedite
my
remissness
by
murdering
my
*NL*
companion
.
When
these
thoughts
possessed
me
,
I
would
not
quit
Henry
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
but
followed
him
as
his
shadow
,
to
protect
him
from
the
*NL*
fancied
rage
of
his
destroyer
.
I
felt
as
if
I
had
committed
some
great
*NL*
crime
,
the
consciousness
of
which
haunted
me
.
I
was
guiltless
,
but
I
had
*NL*
indeed
drawn
down
a
horrible
curse
upon
my
head
,
as
mortal
as
that
of
*NL*
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
visited
Edinburgh
with
languid
eyes
and
mind
;
and
yet
that
city
might
*NL*
have
interested
the
most
unfortunate
being
.
Clerval
did
not
like
it
so
*NL*
well
as
Oxford
;
for
the
antiquity
of
the
latter
city
was
more
pleasing
*NL*
to
him
.
But
the
beauty
and
regularity
of
the
new
town
of
Edinburgh
,
its
*NL*
romantic
castle
,
and
its
environs
,
the
most
delightful
in
the
world
,
*NL*
Arthur
's
Seat
,
St.
Bernard
's
Well
,
and
the
Pentland
Hills
,
compensated
*NL*
him
for
the
change
,
and
filled
him
with
cheerfulness
and
admiration
.
But
*NL*
I
was
impatient
to
arrive
at
the
termination
of
my
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
Edinburgh
in
a
week
,
passing
through
Coupar
,
St.
Andrews
,
and
*NL*
along
the
banks
of
the
Tay
,
to
Perth
,
where
our
friend
expected
us
.
But
*NL*
I
was
in
no
mood
to
laugh
and
talk
with
strangers
,
or
enter
into
their
*NL*
feelings
or
plans
with
the
good
humour
expected
from
a
guest
;
and
*NL*
accordingly
I
told
Clerval
that
I
wished
to
make
the
tour
of
Scotland
*NL*
alone
.
``
Do
you
,
''
said
I
,
``
enjoy
yourself
,
and
let
this
be
our
*NL*
rendezvous
.
I
may
be
absent
a
month
or
two
;
but
do
not
interfere
with
my
*NL*
motions
,
I
entreat
you
:
leave
me
to
peace
and
solitude
for
a
short
time
;
*NL*
and
when
I
return
,
I
hope
it
will
be
with
a
lighter
heart
,
more
*NL*
congenial
to
your
own
temper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
wished
to
dissuade
me
;
but
,
seeing
me
bent
on
this
plan
,
ceased
to
*NL*
remonstrate
.
He
entreated
me
to
write
often
.
``
I
had
rather
be
with
you
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
in
your
solitary
rambles
,
than
with
these
Scotch
people
,
whom
*NL*
I
do
not
know
:
hasten
then
,
my
dear
friend
,
to
return
,
that
I
may
again
*NL*
feel
myself
somewhat
at
home
,
which
I
can
not
do
in
your
absence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
parted
from
my
friend
,
I
determined
to
visit
some
remote
spot
of
*NL*
Scotland
,
and
finish
my
work
in
solitude
.
I
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
*NL*
monster
followed
me
,
and
would
discover
himself
to
me
when
I
should
have
*NL*
finished
,
that
he
might
receive
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
resolution
I
traversed
the
northern
highlands
,
and
fixed
on
*NL*
one
of
the
remotest
of
the
Orkneys
as
the
scene
labours
.
It
was
a
place
*NL*
fitted
for
such
a
work
,
being
hardly
more
than
a
rock
,
whose
high
sides
*NL*
were
continually
beaten
upon
by
the
waves
.
The
soil
was
barren
,
scarcely
*NL*
affording
pasture
for
a
few
miserable
cows
,
and
oatmeal
for
its
*NL*
inhabitants
,
which
consisted
of
five
persons
,
whose
gaunt
and
scraggy
*NL*
limbs
gave
tokens
of
their
miserable
fare
.
Vegetables
and
bread
,
when
*NL*
they
indulged
in
such
luxuries
,
and
even
fresh
water
,
was
to
be
procured
*NL*
from
the
main
land
,
which
was
about
five
miles
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
island
there
were
but
three
miserable
huts
,
and
one
of
*NL*
these
was
vacant
when
I
arrived
.
This
I
hired
.
It
contained
but
two
*NL*
rooms
,
and
these
exhibited
all
the
squalidness
of
the
most
miserable
*NL*
penury
.
The
thatch
had
fallen
in
,
the
walls
were
unplastered
,
and
the
*NL*
door
was
off
its
hinges
.
I
ordered
it
to
be
repaired
,
bought
some
*NL*
furniture
,
and
took
possession
;
an
incident
which
would
,
doubtless
,
have
*NL*
occasioned
some
surprise
,
had
not
all
the
senses
of
the
cottagers
been
*NL*
benumbed
by
want
and
squalid
poverty
.
As
it
was
,
I
lived
ungazed
at
and
*NL*
unmolested
,
hardly
thanked
for
the
pittance
of
food
and
clothes
which
I
*NL*
gave
;
so
much
does
suffering
blunt
even
the
coarsest
sensations
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
retreat
I
devoted
the
morning
to
labour
;
but
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
when
the
weather
permitted
,
I
walked
on
the
stony
beach
of
the
sea
,
to
*NL*
listen
to
the
waves
as
they
roared
,
and
dashed
at
my
feet
.
It
was
a
*NL*
monotonous
,
yet
ever-changing
scene
.
I
thought
of
Switzerland
;
it
was
*NL*
far
different
from
this
desolate
and
appalling
landscape
.
Its
hills
are
*NL*
covered
with
vines
,
and
its
cottages
are
scattered
thickly
in
the
*NL*
plains
.
Its
fair
lakes
reflect
a
blue
and
gentle
sky
;
and
,
when
troubled
*NL*
by
the
winds
,
their
tumult
is
but
as
the
play
of
a
lively
infant
,
when
*NL*
compared
to
the
roarings
of
the
giant
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
I
distributed
my
occupations
when
I
first
arrived
;
but
,
*NL*
as
I
proceeded
in
my
labour
,
it
became
every
day
more
horrible
and
*NL*
irksome
to
me
.
Sometimes
I
could
not
prevail
on
myself
to
enter
my
*NL*
laboratory
for
several
days
;
and
at
other
times
I
toiled
day
and
night
*NL*
in
order
to
complete
my
work
.
It
was
indeed
a
filthy
process
in
which
I
*NL*
was
engaged
.
During
my
first
experiment
,
a
kind
of
enthusiastic
frenzy
*NL*
had
blinded
me
to
the
horror
of
my
employment
;
my
mind
was
intently
*NL*
fixed
on
the
sequel
of
my
labour
,
and
my
eyes
were
shut
to
the
horror
of
*NL*
my
proceedings
.
But
now
I
went
to
it
in
cold
blood
,
and
my
heart
often
*NL*
sickened
at
the
work
of
my
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
situated
,
employed
in
the
most
detestable
occupation
,
immersed
in
a
*NL*
solitude
where
nothing
could
for
an
instant
call
my
attention
from
the
*NL*
actual
scene
in
which
I
was
engaged
,
my
spirits
became
unequal
;
I
grew
*NL*
restless
and
nervous
.
Every
moment
I
feared
to
meet
my
persecutor
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
sat
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
,
fearing
to
raise
them
*NL*
lest
they
should
encounter
the
object
which
I
so
much
dreaded
to
behold
.
*NL*
I
feared
to
wander
from
the
sight
of
my
fellow-creatures
,
lest
when
*NL*
alone
he
should
come
to
claim
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mean
time
I
worked
on
,
and
my
labour
was
already
considerably
*NL*
advanced
.
I
looked
towards
its
completion
with
a
tremulous
and
eager
*NL*
hope
,
which
I
dared
not
trust
myself
to
question
,
but
which
was
*NL*
intermixed
with
obscure
forebodings
of
evil
,
that
made
my
heart
sicken
*NL*
in
my
bosom
.

CHAPTER
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
one
evening
in
my
laboratory
;
the
sun
had
set
,
and
the
moon
was
*NL*
just
rising
from
the
sea
;
I
had
not
sufficient
light
for
my
employment
,
*NL*
and
I
remained
idle
,
in
a
pause
of
consideration
of
whether
I
should
*NL*
leave
my
labour
for
the
night
,
or
hasten
its
conclusion
by
an
*NL*
unremitting
attention
to
it
.
As
I
sat
,
a
train
of
reflection
occurred
to
*NL*
me
,
which
led
me
to
consider
the
effects
of
what
I
was
now
doing
.
Three
*NL*
years
before
I
was
engaged
in
the
same
manner
,
and
had
created
a
fiend
*NL*
whose
unparalleled
barbarity
had
desolated
my
heart
,
and
filled
it
for
*NL*
ever
with
the
bitterest
remorse
.
I
was
now
about
to
form
another
being
,
*NL*
of
whose
dispositions
I
was
alike
ignorant
;
she
might
become
ten
*NL*
thousand
times
more
malignant
than
her
mate
,
and
delight
,
for
its
own
*NL*
sake
,
in
murder
and
wretchedness
.
He
had
sworn
to
quit
the
neighbourhood
*NL*
of
man
,
and
hide
himself
in
deserts
;
but
she
had
not
;
and
she
,
who
in
*NL*
all
probability
was
to
become
a
thinking
and
reasoning
animal
,
might
*NL*
refuse
to
comply
with
a
compact
made
before
her
creation
.
They
might
*NL*
even
hate
each
other
;
the
creature
who
already
lived
loathed
his
own
*NL*
deformity
,
and
might
he
not
conceive
a
greater
abhorence
for
it
when
it
*NL*
came
before
his
eyes
in
the
female
form
?
She
also
might
turn
with
*NL*
disgust
from
him
to
the
superior
beauty
of
man
;
she
might
quit
him
,
and
*NL*
he
be
again
alone
,
exasperated
by
the
fresh
provocation
of
being
*NL*
deserted
by
one
of
his
own
species
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
if
they
were
to
leave
Europe
,
and
inhabit
the
deserts
of
the
new
*NL*
world
,
yet
one
of
the
first
results
of
those
sympathies
for
which
the
*NL*
daemon
thirsted
would
be
children
,
and
a
race
of
devils
would
be
*NL*
propagated
upon
the
earth
,
who
might
make
the
very
existence
of
the
*NL*
species
of
man
a
condition
precarious
and
full
of
terror
.
Had
I
a
right
,
*NL*
for
my
own
benefit
,
to
inflict
this
curse
upon
everlasting
generations
?
*NL*
I
had
before
been
moved
by
the
sophisms
of
the
being
I
had
created
;
I
*NL*
had
been
struck
senseless
by
his
fiendish
threats
:
but
now
,
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
the
wickedness
of
my
promise
burst
upon
me
;
I
shuddered
to
*NL*
think
that
future
ages
might
curse
me
as
their
pest
,
whose
selfishness
*NL*
had
not
hesitated
to
buy
its
own
peace
at
the
price
perhaps
of
the
*NL*
existence
of
the
whole
human
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
,
and
my
heart
failed
within
me
;
when
,
on
looking
up
,
I
saw
,
*NL*
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
the
daemon
at
the
casement
.
A
ghastly
grin
*NL*
wrinkled
his
lips
as
he
gazed
on
me
,
where
I
sat
fulfilling
the
task
*NL*
which
he
had
allotted
to
me
.
Yes
,
he
had
followed
me
in
my
travels
;
he
*NL*
had
loitered
in
forests
,
hid
himself
in
caves
,
or
taken
refuge
in
wide
*NL*
and
desert
heaths
;
and
he
now
came
to
mark
my
progress
,
and
claim
the
*NL*
fulfilment
of
my
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
looked
on
him
,
his
countenance
expressed
the
utmost
extent
of
*NL*
malice
and
treachery
.
I
thought
with
a
sensation
of
madness
on
my
*NL*
promise
of
creating
another
like
to
him
,
and
,
trembling
with
passion
,
*NL*
tore
to
pieces
the
thing
on
which
I
was
engaged
.
The
wretch
saw
me
*NL*
destroy
the
creature
on
whose
future
existence
he
depended
for
*NL*
happiness
,
and
,
with
a
howl
of
devilish
despair
and
revenge
,
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
the
room
,
and
,
locking
the
door
,
made
a
solemn
vow
in
my
own
*NL*
heart
never
to
resume
my
labours
;
and
then
,
with
trembling
steps
,
I
*NL*
sought
my
own
apartment
.
I
was
alone
;
none
were
near
me
to
dissipate
the
*NL*
gloom
,
and
relieve
me
from
the
sickening
oppression
of
the
most
terrible
*NL*
reveries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
hours
past
,
and
I
remained
near
my
window
gazing
on
the
sea
;
it
*NL*
was
almost
motionless
,
for
the
winds
were
hushed
,
and
all
nature
reposed
*NL*
under
the
eye
of
the
quiet
moon
.
A
few
fishing
vessels
alone
specked
the
*NL*
water
,
and
now
and
then
the
gentle
breeze
wafted
the
sound
of
voices
,
as
*NL*
the
fishermen
called
to
one
another
.
I
felt
the
silence
,
although
I
was
*NL*
hardly
conscious
of
its
extreme
profundity
until
my
ear
was
suddenly
*NL*
arrested
by
the
paddling
of
oars
near
the
shore
,
and
a
person
landed
*NL*
close
to
my
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
after
,
I
heard
the
creaking
of
my
door
,
as
if
some
one
*NL*
endeavoured
to
open
it
softly
.
I
trembled
from
head
to
foot
;
I
felt
a
*NL*
presentiment
of
who
it
was
,
and
wished
to
rouse
one
of
the
peasants
who
*NL*
dwelt
in
a
cottage
not
far
from
mine
;
but
I
was
overcome
by
the
*NL*
sensation
of
helplessness
,
so
often
felt
in
frightful
dreams
,
when
you
*NL*
in
vain
endeavour
to
fly
from
an
impending
danger
,
and
was
rooted
to
the
*NL*
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
I
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
along
the
passage
;
the
door
*NL*
opened
,
and
the
wretch
whom
I
dreaded
appeared
.
Shutting
the
door
,
he
*NL*
approached
me
,
and
said
,
in
a
smothered
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
destroyed
the
work
which
you
began
;
what
is
it
that
you
*NL*
intend
?
Do
you
dare
to
break
your
promise
?
I
have
endured
toil
and
*NL*
misery
:
I
left
Switzerland
with
you
;
I
crept
along
the
shores
of
the
*NL*
Rhine
,
among
its
willow
islands
,
and
over
the
summits
of
its
hills
.
I
*NL*
have
dwelt
many
months
in
the
heaths
of
England
,
and
among
the
deserts
*NL*
of
Scotland
.
I
have
endured
incalculable
fatigue
,
and
cold
,
and
hunger
;
*NL*
do
you
dare
destroy
my
hopes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begone
!
I
do
break
my
promise
;
never
will
I
create
another
like
*NL*
yourself
,
equal
in
deformity
and
wickedness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slave
,
I
before
reasoned
with
you
,
but
you
have
proved
yourself
*NL*
unworthy
of
my
condescension
.
Remember
that
I
have
power
;
you
believe
*NL*
yourself
miserable
,
but
I
can
make
you
so
wretched
that
the
light
of
day
*NL*
will
be
hateful
to
you
.
You
are
my
creator
,
but
I
am
your
*NL*
master
;
--
obey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hour
of
my
weakness
is
past
,
and
the
period
of
your
power
is
*NL*
arrived
.
Your
threats
can
not
move
me
to
do
an
act
of
wickedness
;
but
*NL*
they
confirm
me
in
a
resolution
of
not
creating
you
a
companion
in
vice
.
*NL*
Shall
I
,
in
cool
blood
,
set
loose
upon
the
earth
a
daemon
,
whose
delight
*NL*
is
in
death
and
wretchedness
.
Begone
!
I
am
firm
,
and
your
words
will
*NL*
only
exasperate
my
rage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
monster
saw
my
determination
in
my
face
,
and
gnashed
his
teeth
in
*NL*
the
impotence
of
anger
.
``
Shall
each
man
,
''
cried
he
,
``
find
a
wife
for
his
*NL*
bosom
,
and
each
beast
have
his
mate

and
I
be
alone
?
I
had
feelings
of
*NL*
affection
,
and
they
were
requited
by
detestation
and
scorn
.
Man
,
you
may
*NL*
hate
;
but
beware
!
Your
hours
will
pass
in
dread
and
misery
,
and
soon
the
*NL*
bolt
will
fall
which
must
ravish
from
you
your
happiness
for
ever
.
Are
*NL*
you
to
be
happy
,
while
I
grovel
in
the
intensity
of
my
wretchedness
?
You
*NL*
can
blast
my
other
passions
;
but
revenge
remains
--
revenge
,
henceforth
*NL*
dearer
than
light
or
food
!
I
may
die
;
but
first
you
,
my
tyrant
and
*NL*
tormentor
,
shall
curse
the
sun
that
gazes
on
your
misery

Beware
;
for
I

am
fearless

therefore
powerful

I
will
watch
with
the
wiliness
of
a

that
I
may
sting
with
its
venom

you
shall
repent
of
the

injuries
you
inflict

cease

I
*NL*
have
declared
my
resolution
to
you
,
and
I
am
no
coward
to
bend
beneath
*NL*
words
.
Leave
me
;
I
am
inexorable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
.
I
go
;
but
remember
,
I
shall
be
with
you
on
your
*NL*
wedding-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
started
forward
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
Villain
!
before
you
sign
my
*NL*
death-warrant
,
be
sure
that
you
are
yourself
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
seized
him
;
but
he
eluded
me
,
and
quitted
the
house
with
*NL*
precipitation
:
in
a
few
moments
I
saw
him
in
his
boat
,
which
shot
across
*NL*
the
waters
with
an
arrowy
swiftness
,
and
was
soon
lost
amidst
the
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
again
silent
;
but
his
words
rung
in
my
ears
.
I
burned
with
rage
*NL*
to
pursue
the
murderer
of
my
peace
,
and
precipitate
him
into
the
ocean
.
*NL*
I
walked
up
and
down
my
room
hastily
and
perturbed
,
while
my
imagination
*NL*
conjured
up
a
thousand
images
to
torment
and
sting
me
.
Why
had
I
not
*NL*
followed
him
,
and
closed
with
him
in
mortal
strife
?
But
I
had
suffered
*NL*
him
to
depart
,
and
he
had
directed
his
course
towards
the
main
land
.
I
*NL*
shuddered
to
think
who
might
be
the
next
victim
sacrificed
to
his
*NL*
insatiate
revenge
.
And
then
I
thought
again
of
his
words
--
''
_
I
will
be
*NL*
with
you
on
your
wedding-night
.
_
''
That
then
was
the
period
fixed
for
the
*NL*
fulfilment
of
my
destiny
.
In
that
hour
I
should
die
,
and
at
once
satisfy
*NL*
and
extinguish
his
malice
.
The
prospect
did
not
move
me
to
fear
;
yet
*NL*
when
I
thought
of
my
beloved
Elizabeth
,
--
of
her
tears
and
endless
*NL*
sorrow
,
when
she
should
find
her
lover
so
barbarously
snatched
from
*NL*
her
,
--
tears
,
the
first
I
had
shed
for
many
months
,
streamed
from
my
*NL*
eyes
,
and
I
resolved
not
to
fall
before
my
enemy
without
a
bitter
*NL*
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
passed
away
,
and
the
sun
rose
from
the
ocean
;
my
feelings
*NL*
became
calmer
,
if
it
may
be
called
calmness
,
when
the
violence
of
rage
*NL*
sinks
into
the
depths
of
despair
.
I
left
the
house
,
the
horrid
scene
of
*NL*
the
last
night
's
contention
,
and
walked
on
the
beach
of
the
sea
,
which
I
*NL*
almost
regarded
as
an
insuperable
barrier
between
me
and
my
*NL*
fellow-creatures
;
nay
,
a
wish
that
such
should
prove
the
fact
stole
*NL*
across
me
.
I
desired
that
I
might
pass
my
life
on
that
barren
rock
,
*NL*
wearily
it
is
true
,
but
uninterrupted
by
any
sudden
shock
of
misery
.
If
*NL*
I
returned
,
it
was
to
be
sacrificed
,
or
to
see
those
whom
I
most
loved
*NL*
die
under
the
grasp
of
a
daemon
whom
I
had
myself
created
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
about
the
isle
like
a
restless
spectre
,
separated
from
all
it
*NL*
loved
,
and
miserable
in
the
separation
.
When
it
became
noon
,
and
the
sun
*NL*
rose
higher
,
I
lay
down
on
the
grass
,
and
was
overpowered
by
a
deep
*NL*
sleep
.
I
had
been
awake
the
whole
of
the
preceding
night
,
my
nerves
were
*NL*
agitated
,
and
my
eyes
inflamed
by
watching
and
misery
.
The
sleep
into
*NL*
which
I
now
sunk
refreshed
me
;
and
when
I
awoke
,
I
again
felt
as
if
I
*NL*
belonged
to
a
race
of
human
beings
like
myself
,
and
I
began
to
reflect
*NL*
upon
what
had
passed
with
greater
composure
;
yet
still
the
words
of
the
*NL*
fiend
rung
in
my
ears
like
a
death-knell
,
they
appeared
like
a
dream
,
*NL*
yet
distinct
and
oppressive
as
a
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
far
descended
,
and
I
still
sat
on
the
shore
,
satisfying
my
*NL*
appetite
,
which
had
become
ravenous
,
with
an
oaten
cake
,
when
I
saw
a
*NL*
fishing-boat
land
close
to
me
,
and
one
of
the
men
brought
me
a
packet
;
*NL*
it
contained
letters
from
Geneva
,
and
one
from
Clerval
,
entreating
me
to
*NL*
join
him
.
He
said
that
nearly
a
year
had
elapsed
since
we
had
quitted
*NL*
Switzerland
,
and
France
was
yet
unvisited
.
He
entreated
me
,
therefore
,
*NL*
to
leave
my
solitary
isle
,
and
meet
him
at
Perth
,
in
a
week
from
that
*NL*
time
,
when
we
might
arrange
the
plan
of
our
future
proceedings
.
This
*NL*
letter
in
a
degree
recalled
me
to
life
,
and
I
determined
to
quit
my
*NL*
island
at
the
expiration
of
two
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
before
I
departed
,
there
was
a
task
to
perform
,
on
which
I
*NL*
shuddered
to
reflect
:
I
must
pack
my
chemical
instruments
;
and
for
that
*NL*
purpose
I
must
enter
the
room
which
had
been
the
scene
of
my
odious
*NL*
work
,
and
I
must
handle
those
utensils
,
the
sight
of
which
was
sickening
*NL*
to
me
.
The
next
morning
,
at
day-break
,
I
summoned
sufficient
courage
,
*NL*
and
unlocked
the
door
of
my
laboratory
.
The
remains
of
the
half-finished
*NL*
creature
,
whom
I
had
destroyed
,
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
,
and
I
almost
*NL*
felt
as
if
I
had
mangled
the
living
flesh
of
a
human
being
.
I
paused
to
*NL*
collect
myself
,
and
then
entered
the
chamber
.
With
trembling
hand
I
*NL*
conveyed
the
instruments
out
of
the
room
;
but
I
reflected
that
I
ought
*NL*
not
to
leave
the
relics
of
my
work
to
excite
the
horror
and
suspicion
of
*NL*
the
peasants
,
and
I
accordingly
put
them
into
a
basket
,
with
a
great
*NL*
quantity
of
stones
,
and
laying
them
up
,
determined
to
throw
them
into
*NL*
the
sea
that
very
night
;
and
in
the
mean
time
I
sat
upon
the
beach
,
*NL*
employed
in
cleaning
and
arranging
my
chemical
apparatus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
more
complete
than
the
alteration
that
had
taken
place
*NL*
in
my
feelings
since
the
night
of
the
appearance
of
the
daemon
.
I
had
*NL*
before
regarded
my
promise
with
a
gloomy
despair
,
as
a
thing
that
,
with
*NL*
whatever
consequences
,
must
be
fulfilled
;
but
I
now
felt
as
if
a
film
*NL*
had
been
taken
from
before
my
eyes
,
and
that
I
,
for
the
first
time
,
saw
*NL*
clearly
.
The
idea
of
renewing
my
labours
did
not
for
one
instant
occur
*NL*
to
me
;
the
threat
I
had
heard
weighed
on
my
thoughts
,
but
I
did
not
*NL*
reflect
that
a
voluntary
act
of
mine
could
avert
it
.
I
had
resolved
in
*NL*
my
own
mind
,
that
to
create
another
like
the
fiend
I
had
first
made
*NL*
would
be
an
act
of
the
basest
and
most
atrocious
selfishness
;
and
I
*NL*
banished
from
my
mind
every
thought
that
could
lead
to
a
different
*NL*
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
the
moon
rose
;
and
I
then
,
putting
*NL*
my
basket
aboard
a
little
skiff
,
sailed
out
about
four
miles
from
the
*NL*
shore
.
The
scene
was
perfectly
solitary
:
a
few
boats
were
returning
*NL*
towards
land
,
but
I
sailed
away
from
them
.
I
felt
as
if
I
was
about
the
*NL*
commission
of
a
dreadful
crime
,
and
avoided
with
shuddering
anxiety
any
*NL*
encounter
with
my
fellow-creatures
.
At
one
time
the
moon
,
which
had
*NL*
before
been
clear
,
was
suddenly
overspread
by
a
thick
cloud
,
and
I
took
*NL*
advantage
of
the
moment
of
darkness
,
and
cast
my
basket
into
the
sea
;
I
*NL*
listened
to
the
gurgling
sound
as
it
sunk
,
and
then
sailed
away
from
the
*NL*
spot
.
The
sky
became
clouded
;
but
the
air
was
pure
,
although
chilled
by
*NL*
the
north-east
breeze
that
was
then
rising
.
But
it
refreshed
me
,
and
*NL*
filled
me
with
such
agreeable
sensations
,
that
I
resolved
to
prolong
my
*NL*
stay
on
the
water
,
and
fixing
the
rudder
in
a
direct
position
,
stretched
*NL*
myself
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
Clouds
hid
the
moon
,
every
thing
was
*NL*
obscure
,
and
I
heard
only
the
sound
of
the
boat
,
as
its
keel
cut
through
*NL*
the
waves
;
the
murmur
lulled
me
,
and
in
a
short
time
I
slept
soundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
how
long
I
remained
in
this
situation
,
but
when
I
awoke
I
*NL*
found
that
the
sun
had
already
mounted
considerably
.
The
wind
was
high
,
*NL*
and
the
waves
continually
threatened
the
safety
of
my
little
skiff
.
I
*NL*
found
that
the
wind
was
north-east
,
and
must
have
driven
me
far
from
the
*NL*
coast
from
which
I
had
embarked
.
I
endeavoured
to
change
my
course
,
but
*NL*
quickly
found
that
if
I
again
made
the
attempt
the
boat
would
be
*NL*
instantly
filled
with
water
.
Thus
situated
,
my
only
resource
was
to
*NL*
drive
before
the
wind
.
I
confess
that
I
felt
a
few
sensations
of
terror
.
*NL*
I
had
no
compass
with
me
,
and
was
so
little
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
geography
of
this
part
of
the
world
that
the
sun
was
of
little
benefit
*NL*
to
me
.
I
might
be
driven
into
the
wide
Atlantic
,
and
feel
all
the
*NL*
tortures
of
starvation
,
or
be
swallowed
up
in
the
immeasurable
waters
*NL*
that
roared
and
buffeted
around
me
.
I
had
already
been
out
many
hours
,
*NL*
and
felt
the
torment
of
a
burning
thirst
,
a
prelude
to
my
other
*NL*
sufferings
.
I
looked
on
the
heavens
,
which
were
covered
by
clouds
that
*NL*
flew
before
the
wind
only
to
be
replaced
by
others
:
I
looked
upon
the
*NL*
sea
,
it
was
to
be
my
grave
.
``
Fiend
,
''
I
exclaimed
,
``
your
task
is
already
*NL*
fulfilled
!
''
I
thought
of
Elizabeth
,
of
my
father
,
and
of
Clerval
;
and
*NL*
sunk
into
a
reverie
,
so
despairing
and
frightful
,
that
even
now
,
when
*NL*
the
scene
is
on
the
point
of
closing
before
me
for
ever
,
I
shudder
to
*NL*
reflect
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
hours
passed
thus
;
but
by
degrees
,
as
the
sun
declined
towards
the
*NL*
horizon
,
the
wind
died
away
into
a
gentle
breeze
,
and
the
sea
became
*NL*
free
from
breakers
.
But
these
gave
place
to
a
heavy
swell
;
I
felt
sick
,
*NL*
and
hardly
able
to
hold
the
rudder
,
when
suddenly
I
saw
a
line
of
high
*NL*
land
towards
the
south
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
spent
,
as
I
was
,
by
fatigue
,
and
the
dreadful
suspense
I
endured
*NL*
for
several
hours
,
this
sudden
certainty
of
life
rushed
like
a
flood
of
*NL*
warm
joy
to
my
heart
,
and
tears
gushed
from
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
mutable
are
our
feelings
,
and
how
strange
is
that
clinging
love
we
*NL*
have
of
life
even
in
the
excess
of
misery
!
I
constructed
another
sail
*NL*
with
a
part
of
my
dress
,
and
eagerly
steered
my
course
towards
the
land
.
*NL*
It
had
a
wild
and
rocky
appearance
;
but
as
I
approached
nearer
,
I
easily
*NL*
perceived
the
traces
of
cultivation
.
I
saw
vessels
near
the
shore
,
and
*NL*
found
myself
suddenly
transported
back
to
the
neighbourhood
of
civilized
*NL*
man
.
I
eagerly
traced
the
windings
of
the
land
,
and
hailed
a
steeple
*NL*
which
I
at
length
saw
issuing
from
behind
a
small
promontory
.
As
I
was
*NL*
in
a
state
of
extreme
debility
,
I
resolved
to
sail
directly
towards
the
*NL*
town
as
a
place
where
I
could
most
easily
procure
nourishment
.
*NL*
Fortunately
I
had
money
with
me
.
As
I
turned
the
promontory
,
I
perceived
*NL*
a
small
neat
town
and
a
good
harbour
,
which
I
entered
,
my
heart
bounding
*NL*
with
joy
at
my
unexpected
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
occupied
in
fixing
the
boat
and
arranging
the
sails
,
several
*NL*
people
crowded
towards
the
spot
.
They
seemed
very
much
surprised
at
my
*NL*
appearance
;
but
,
instead
of
offering
me
any
assistance
,
whispered
*NL*
together
with
gestures
that
at
any
other
time
might
have
produced
in
me
*NL*
a
slight
sensation
of
alarm
.
As
it
was
,
I
merely
remarked
that
they
*NL*
spoke
English
;
and
I
therefore
addressed
them
in
that
language
:
``
My
good
*NL*
friends
,
''
said
I
,
``
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
the
name
of
this
*NL*
town
,
and
inform
me
where
I
am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
know
that
soon
enough
,
''
replied
a
man
with
a
gruff
voice
.
``
May
*NL*
be
you
are
come
to
a
place
that
will
not
prove
much
to
your
taste
;
but
*NL*
you
will
not
be
consulted
as
to
your
quarters
,
I
promise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
exceedingly
surprised
on
receiving
so
rude
an
answer
from
a
*NL*
stranger
;
and
I
was
also
disconcerted
on
perceiving
the
frowning
and
*NL*
angry
countenances
of
his
companions
.
``
Why
do
you
answer
me
so
roughly
?
''
*NL*
I
replied
:
``
surely
it
is
not
the
custom
of
Englishmen
to
receive
*NL*
strangers
so
inhospitably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
what
the
custom
of
the
English
may
be
;
*NL*
but
it
is
the
custom
of
the
Irish
to
hate
villains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
strange
dialogue
continued
,
I
perceived
the
crowd
rapidly
*NL*
increase
.
Their
faces
expressed
a
mixture
of
curiosity
and
anger
,
which
*NL*
annoyed
,
and
in
some
degree
alarmed
me
.
I
inquired
the
way
to
the
inn
;
*NL*
but
no
one
replied
.
I
then
moved
forward
,
and
a
murmuring
sound
arose
*NL*
from
the
crowd
as
they
followed
and
surrounded
me
;
when
an
ill-looking
*NL*
man
approaching
,
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
,
``
Come
,
Sir
,
you
*NL*
must
follow
me
to
Mr.
Kirwin
's
,
to
give
an
account
of
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
Mr.
Kirwin
?
Why
am
I
to
give
an
account
of
myself
?
Is
not
this
a
*NL*
free
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
Sir
,
free
enough
for
honest
folks
.
Mr.
Kirwin
is
a
magistrate
;
and
*NL*
you
are
to
give
an
account
of
the
death
of
a
gentleman
who
was
found
*NL*
murdered
here
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
answer
startled
me
;
but
I
presently
recovered
myself
.
I
was
*NL*
innocent
;
that
could
easily
be
proved
:
accordingly
I
followed
my
*NL*
conductor
in
silence
,
and
was
led
to
one
of
the
best
houses
in
the
town
.
*NL*
I
was
ready
to
sink
from
fatigue
and
hunger
;
but
,
being
surrounded
by
a
*NL*
crowd
,
I
thought
it
politic
to
rouse
all
my
strength
,
that
no
physical
*NL*
debility
might
be
construed
into
apprehension
or
conscious
guilt
.
Little
*NL*
did
I
then
expect
the
calamity
that
was
in
a
few
moments
to
overwhelm
*NL*
me
,
and
extinguish
in
horror
and
despair
all
fear
of
ignominy
or
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
pause
here
;
for
it
requires
all
my
fortitude
to
recall
the
memory
*NL*
of
the
frightful
events
which
I
am
about
to
relate
,
in
proper
detail
,
to
*NL*
my
recollection
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
soon
introduced
into
the
presence
of
the
magistrate
,
an
old
*NL*
benevolent
man
,
with
calm
and
mild
manners
.
He
looked
upon
me
,
however
,
*NL*
with
some
degree
of
severity
;
and
then
,
turning
towards
my
conductors
,
*NL*
he
asked
who
appeared
as
witnesses
on
this
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
half
a
dozen
men
came
forward
;
and
one
being
selected
by
the
*NL*
magistrate
,
he
deposed
,
that
he
had
been
out
fishing
the
night
before
*NL*
with
his
son
and
brother-in-law
,
Daniel
Nugent
,
when
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
*NL*
they
observed
a
strong
northerly
blast
rising
,
and
they
accordingly
put
*NL*
in
for
port
.
It
was
a
very
dark
night
,
as
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
;
*NL*
they
did
not
land
at
the
harbour
,
but
,
as
they
had
been
accustomed
,
at
a
*NL*
creek
about
two
miles
below
.
He
walked
on
first
,
carrying
a
part
of
the
*NL*
fishing
tackle
,
and
his
companions
followed
him
at
some
distance
.
As
he
*NL*
was
proceeding
along
the
sands
,
he
struck
his
foot
against
something
,
*NL*
and
fell
all
his
length
on
the
ground
.
His
companions
came
up
to
assist
*NL*
him
;
and
,
by
the
light
of
their
lantern
,
they
found
that
he
had
fallen
*NL*
on
the
body
of
a
man
,
who
was
to
all
appearance
dead
.
Their
first
*NL*
supposition
was
,
that
it
was
the
corpse
of
some
person
who
had
been
*NL*
drowned
,
and
was
thrown
on
shore
by
the
waves
;
but
,
upon
examination
,
*NL*
they
found
that
the
clothes
were
not
wet
,
and
even
that
the
body
was
not
*NL*
then
cold
.
They
instantly
carried
it
to
the
cottage
of
an
old
woman
near
*NL*
the
spot
,
and
endeavoured
,
but
in
vain
,
to
restore
it
to
life
.
He
*NL*
appeared
to
be
a
handsome
young
man
,
about
five
and
twenty
years
of
age
.
*NL*
He
had
apparently
been
strangled
;
for
there
was
no
sign
of
any
violence
,
*NL*
except
the
black
mark
of
fingers
on
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
part
of
this
deposition
did
not
in
the
least
interest
me
;
but
*NL*
when
the
mark
of
the
fingers
was
mentioned
,
I
remembered
the
murder
of
*NL*
my
brother
,
and
felt
myself
extremely
agitated
;
my
limbs
trembled
,
and
a
*NL*
mist
came
over
my
eyes
,
which
obliged
me
to
lean
on
a
chair
for
support
.
*NL*
The
magistrate
observed
me
with
a
keen
eye
,
and
of
course
drew
an
*NL*
unfavourable
augury
from
my
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
son
confirmed
his
father
's
account
:
but
when
Daniel
Nugent
was
*NL*
called
,
he
swore
positively
that
,
just
before
the
fall
of
his
companion
,
*NL*
he
saw
a
boat
,
with
a
single
man
in
it
,
at
a
short
distance
from
the
*NL*
shore
;
and
,
as
far
as
he
could
judge
by
the
light
of
a
few
stars
,
it
was
*NL*
the
same
boat
in
which
I
had
just
landed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
deposed
,
that
she
lived
near
the
beach
,
and
was
standing
at
the
*NL*
door
of
her
cottage
,
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
fishermen
,
about
an
*NL*
hour
before
she
heard
of
the
discovery
of
the
body
,
when
she
saw
a
boat
,
*NL*
with
only
one
man
in
it
,
push
off
from
that
part
of
the
shore
where
the
*NL*
corpse
was
afterwards
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
woman
confirmed
the
account
of
the
fishermen
having
brought
the
*NL*
body
into
her
house
;
it
was
not
cold
.
They
put
it
into
a
bed
,
and
rubbed
*NL*
it
;
and
Daniel
went
to
the
town
for
an
apothecary
,
but
life
was
quite
*NL*
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
other
men
were
examined
concerning
my
landing
;
and
they
agreed
,
*NL*
that
,
with
the
strong
north
wind
that
had
arisen
during
the
night
,
it
*NL*
was
very
probable
that
I
had
beaten
about
for
many
hours
,
and
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
return
nearly
to
the
same
spot
from
which
I
had
departed
.
*NL*
Besides
,
they
observed
that
it
appeared
that
I
had
brought
the
body
from
*NL*
another
place
,
and
it
was
likely
,
that
as
I
did
not
appear
to
know
the
*NL*
shore
,
I
might
have
put
into
the
harbour
ignorant
of
the
distance
of
the
*NL*
town
of
--
from
the
place
where
I
had
deposited
the
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kirwin
,
on
hearing
this
evidence
,
desired
that
I
should
be
taken
*NL*
into
the
room
where
the
body
lay
for
interment
that
it
might
be
observed
*NL*
what
effect
the
sight
of
it
would
produce
upon
me
.
This
idea
was
*NL*
probably
suggested
by
the
extreme
agitation
I
had
exhibited
when
the
*NL*
mode
of
the
murder
had
been
described
.
I
was
accordingly
conducted
,
by
*NL*
the
magistrate
and
several
other
persons
,
to
the
inn
.
I
could
not
help
*NL*
being
struck
by
the
strange
coincidences
that
had
taken
place
during
*NL*
this
eventful
night
;
but
,
knowing
that
I
had
been
conversing
with
*NL*
several
persons
in
the
island
I
had
inhabited
about
the
time
that
the
*NL*
body
had
been
found
,
I
was
perfectly
tranquil
as
to
the
consequences
of
*NL*
the
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
entered
the
room
where
the
corpse
lay
,
and
was
led
up
to
the
coffin
.
*NL*
How
can
I
describe
my
sensations
on
beholding
it
?
I
feel
yet
parched
*NL*
with
horror
,
nor
can
I
reflect
on
that
terrible
moment
without
*NL*
shuddering
and
agony
,
that
faintly
reminds
me
of
the
anguish
of
the
*NL*
recognition
.
The
trial
,
the
presence
of
the
magistrate
and
witnesses
,
*NL*
passed
like
a
dream
from
my
memory
,
when
I
saw
the
lifeless
form
of
*NL*
Henry
Clerval
stretched
before
me
.
I
gasped
for
breath
;
and
,
throwing
*NL*
myself
on
the
body
,
I
exclaimed
,
``
Have
my
murderous
machinations
*NL*
deprived
you
also
,
my
dearest
Henry
,
of
life
?
Two
I
have
already
*NL*
destroyed
;
other
victims
await
their
destiny
:
but
you
,
Clerval
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
my
benefactor
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
human
frame
could
no
longer
support
the
agonizing
suffering
that
I
*NL*
endured
,
and
I
was
carried
out
of
the
room
in
strong
convulsions
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fever
succeeded
to
this
.
I
lay
for
two
months
on
the
point
of
death
:
*NL*
my
ravings
,
as
I
afterwards
heard
,
were
frightful
;
I
called
myself
the
*NL*
murderer
of
William
,
of
Justine
,
and
of
Clerval
.
Sometimes
I
entreated
*NL*
my
attendants
to
assist
me
in
the
destruction
of
the
fiend
by
whom
I
was
*NL*
tormented
;
and
,
at
others
,
I
felt
the
fingers
of
the
monster
already
*NL*
grasping
my
neck
,
and
screamed
aloud
with
agony
and
terror
.
Fortunately
,
*NL*
as
I
spoke
my
native
language
,
Mr.
Kirwin
alone
understood
me
;
but
my
*NL*
gestures
and
bitter
cries
were
sufficient
to
affright
the
other
*NL*
witnesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
I
not
die
?
More
miserable
than
man
ever
was
before
,
why
did
I
*NL*
not
sink
into
forgetfulness
and
rest
?
Death
snatches
away
many
blooming
*NL*
children
,
the
only
hopes
of
their
doating
parents
:
how
many
brides
and
*NL*
youthful
lovers
have
been
one
day
in
the
bloom
of
health
and
hope
,
and
*NL*
the
next
a
prey
for
worms
and
the
decay
of
the
tomb
!
Of
what
materials
*NL*
was
I
made
,
that
I
could
thus
resist
so
many
shocks
,
which
,
like
the
*NL*
turning
of
the
wheel
,
continually
renewed
the
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
doomed
to
live
;
and
,
in
two
months
,
found
myself
as
awaking
*NL*
from
a
dream
,
in
a
prison
,
stretched
on
a
wretched
bed
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
gaolers
,
turnkeys
,
bolts
,
and
all
the
miserable
apparatus
of
a
dungeon
.
*NL*
It
was
morning
,
I
remember
,
when
I
thus
awoke
to
understanding
:
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
the
particulars
of
what
had
happened
,
and
only
felt
as
if
some
*NL*
great
misfortune
had
suddenly
overwhelmed
me
;
but
when
I
looked
around
,
*NL*
and
saw
the
barred
windows
,
and
the
squalidness
of
the
room
in
which
I
*NL*
was
,
all
flashed
across
my
memory
,
and
I
groaned
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sound
disturbed
an
old
woman
who
was
sleeping
in
a
chair
beside
me
.
*NL*
She
was
a
hired
nurse
,
the
wife
of
one
of
the
turnkeys
,
and
her
*NL*
countenance
expressed
all
those
bad
qualities
which
often
characterize
*NL*
that
class
.
The
lines
of
her
face
were
hard
and
rude
,
like
that
of
*NL*
persons
accustomed
to
see
without
sympathizing
in
sights
of
misery
.
Her
*NL*
tone
expressed
her
entire
indifference
;
she
addressed
me
in
English
,
and
*NL*
the
voice
struck
me
as
one
that
I
had
heard
during
my
sufferings
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
better
now
,
Sir
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
in
the
same
language
,
with
a
feeble
voice
,
``
I
believe
I
am
;
*NL*
but
if
it
be
all
true
,
if
indeed
I
did
not
dream
,
I
am
sorry
that
I
am
*NL*
still
alive
to
feel
this
misery
and
horror
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
that
matter
,
''
replied
the
old
woman
,
``
if
you
mean
about
the
*NL*
gentleman
you
murdered
,
I
believe
that
it
were
better
for
you
if
you
*NL*
were
dead
,
for
I
fancy
it
will
go
hard
with
you
;
but
you
will
be
hung
*NL*
when
the
next
sessions
come
on
.
However
,
that
's
none
of
my
business
,
I
*NL*
am
sent
to
nurse
you
,
and
get
you
well
;
I
do
my
duty
with
a
safe
*NL*
conscience
,
it
were
well
if
every
body
did
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
with
loathing
from
the
woman
who
could
utter
so
unfeeling
a
*NL*
speech
to
a
person
just
saved
,
on
the
very
edge
of
death
;
but
I
felt
*NL*
languid
,
and
unable
to
reflect
on
all
that
had
passed
.
The
whole
series
*NL*
of
my
life
appeared
to
me
as
a
dream
;
I
sometimes
doubted
if
indeed
it
*NL*
were
all
true
,
for
it
never
presented
itself
to
my
mind
with
the
force
*NL*
of
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
images
that
floated
before
me
became
more
distinct
,
I
grew
*NL*
feverish
;
a
darkness
pressed
around
me
;
no
one
was
near
me
who
soothed
*NL*
me
with
the
gentle
voice
of
love
;
no
dear
hand
supported
me
.
The
*NL*
physician
came
and
prescribed
medicines
,
and
the
old
woman
prepared
them
*NL*
for
me
;
but
utter
carelessness
was
visible
in
the
first
,
and
the
*NL*
expression
of
brutality
was
strongly
marked
in
the
visage
of
the
second
.
*NL*
Who
could
be
interested
in
the
fate
of
a
murderer
,
but
the
hangman
who
*NL*
would
gain
his
fee
?
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
my
first
reflections
;
but
I
soon
learned
that
Mr.
Kirwin
had
*NL*
shewn
me
extreme
kindness
.
He
had
caused
the
best
room
in
the
prison
to
*NL*
be
prepared
for
me
-LRB-
wretched
indeed
was
the
best
-RRB-
;
and
it
was
he
who
had
*NL*
provided
a
physician
and
a
nurse
.
It
is
true
,
he
seldom
came
to
see
me
;
*NL*
for
,
although
he
ardently
desired
to
relieve
the
sufferings
of
every
*NL*
human
creature
,
he
did
not
wish
to
be
present
at
the
agonies
and
*NL*
miserable
ravings
of
a
murderer
.
He
came
,
therefore
,
sometimes
to
see
*NL*
that
I
was
not
neglected
;
but
his
visits
were
short
,
and
at
long
*NL*
intervals
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
I
was
gradually
recovering
,
I
was
seated
in
a
chair
,
my
*NL*
eyes
half
open
,
and
my
cheeks
livid
like
those
in
death
,
I
was
overcome
*NL*
by
gloom
and
misery
,
and
often
reflected
I
had
better
seek
death
than
*NL*
remain
miserably
pent
up
only
to
be
let
loose
in
a
world
replete
with
*NL*
wretchedness
.
At
one
time
I
considered
whether
I
should
not
declare
*NL*
myself
guilty
,
and
suffer
the
penalty
of
the
law
,
less
innocent
than
*NL*
poor
Justine
had
been
.
Such
were
my
thoughts
,
when
the
door
of
my
*NL*
apartment
was
opened
,
and
Mr.
Kirwin
entered
.
His
countenance
expressed
*NL*
sympathy
and
compassion
;
he
drew
a
chair
close
to
mine
,
and
addressed
me
*NL*
in
French
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
that
this
place
is
very
shocking
to
you
;
can
I
do
any
thing
to
*NL*
make
you
more
comfortable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
;
but
all
that
you
mention
is
nothing
to
me
:
on
the
whole
*NL*
earth
there
is
no
comfort
which
I
am
capable
of
receiving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
the
sympathy
of
a
stranger
can
be
but
of
little
relief
to
*NL*
one
borne
down
as
you
are
by
so
strange
a
misfortune
.
But
you
will
,
I
*NL*
hope
,
soon
quit
this
melancholy
abode
;
for
,
doubtless
,
evidence
can
*NL*
easily
be
brought
to
free
you
from
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
least
concern
:
I
am
,
by
a
course
of
strange
events
,
become
*NL*
the
most
miserable
of
mortals
.
Persecuted
and
tortured
as
I
am
and
have
*NL*
been

can
death
be
any
evil

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
indeed
could
be
more
unfortunate
and
agonizing
than
the
strange
*NL*
chances
that
have
lately
occurred
.
You
were
thrown
,
by
some
surprising
*NL*
accident
,
on
this
shore
,
renowned
for
its
hospitality
:
seized
*NL*
immediately
,
and
charged
with
murder
.
The
first
sight
that
was
presented
*NL*
to
your
eyes
was
the
body
of
your
friend
,
murdered
in
so
unaccountable
a
*NL*
manner
,
and
placed
,
as
it
were
,
by
some
fiend
across
your
path
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Kirwin
said
this
,
notwithstanding
the
agitation
I
endured
on
this
*NL*
retrospect
of
my
sufferings
,
I
also
felt
considerable
surprise
at
the
*NL*
knowledge
he
seemed
to
possess
concerning
me
.
I
suppose
some
*NL*
astonishment
was
exhibited
in
my
countenance
;
for
Mr.
Kirwin
hastened
to
*NL*
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
until
a
day
or
two
after
your
illness
that
I
thought
of
*NL*
examining
your
dress
,
that
I
might
discover
some
trace
by
which
I
could
*NL*
send
to
your
relations
an
account
of
your
misfortune
and
illness
.
I
*NL*
found
several
letters
,
and
,
among
others
,
one
which
I
discovered
from
*NL*
its
commencement
to
be
from
your
father
.
I
instantly
wrote
to
Geneva
:
*NL*
nearly
two
months
have
elapsed
since
the
departure
of
my
letter
.
--
But
*NL*
you
are
ill
;
even
now
you
tremble
:
you
are
unfit
for
agitation
of
any
*NL*
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
suspense
is
a
thousand
times
worse
than
the
most
horrible
event
:
*NL*
tell
me
what
new
scene
of
death
has
been
acted
,
and
whose
murder
I
am
*NL*
now
to
lament
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
family
is
perfectly
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Kirwin
,
with
gentleness
;
``
and
*NL*
some
one
,
a
friend
,
is
come
to
visit
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
not
by
what
chain
of
thought
the
idea
presented
itself
,
but
it
*NL*
instantly
darted
into
my
mind
that
the
murderer
had
come
to
mock
at
my
*NL*
misery
,
and
taunt
me
with
the
death
of
Clerval
,
as
a
new
incitement
for
*NL*
me
to
comply
with
his
hellish
desires
.
I
put
my
hand
before
my
eyes
,
and
*NL*
cried
out
in
agony
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
take
him
away
!
I
can
not
see
him
;
for
God
's
sake
,
do
not
let
him
*NL*
enter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kirwin
regarded
me
with
a
troubled
countenance
.
He
could
not
help
*NL*
regarding
my
exclamation
as
a
presumption
of
my
guilt
,
and
said
,
in
*NL*
rather
a
severe
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
thought
,
young
man
,
that
the
presence
of
your
father
*NL*
would
have
been
welcome
,
instead
of
inspiring
such
violent
repugnance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
!
''
cried
I
,
while
every
feature
and
every
muscle
was
relaxed
*NL*
from
anguish
to
pleasure
.
``
Is
my
father
,
indeed
,
come
?
How
kind
,
how
*NL*
very
kind
.
But
where
is
he
,
why
does
he
not
hasten
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
change
of
manner
surprised
and
pleased
the
magistrate
;
perhaps
he
*NL*
thought
that
my
former
exclamation
was
a
momentary
return
of
delirium
,
*NL*
and
now
he
instantly
resumed
his
former
benevolence
.
He
rose
,
and
*NL*
quitted
the
room
with
my
nurse
,
and
in
a
moment
my
father
entered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
,
at
this
moment
,
could
have
given
me
greater
pleasure
than
the
*NL*
arrival
of
my
father
.
I
stretched
out
my
hand
to
him
,
and
cried
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
then
safe
--
and
Elizabeth
--
and
Ernest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
calmed
me
with
assurances
of
their
welfare
,
and
endeavoured
,
*NL*
by
dwelling
on
these
subjects
so
interesting
to
my
heart
,
to
raise
my
*NL*
desponding
spirits
;
but
he
soon
felt
that
a
prison
can
not
be
the
abode
*NL*
of
cheerfulness
.
``
What
a
place
is
this
that
you
inhabit
,
my
son
!
''
said
*NL*
he
,
looking
mournfully
at
the
barred
windows
,
and
wretched
appearance
of
*NL*
the
room
.
``
You
travelled
to
seek
happiness
,
but
a
fatality
seems
to
*NL*
pursue
you
.
And
poor
Clerval
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
my
unfortunate
and
murdered
friend
was
an
agitation
too
*NL*
great
to
be
endured
in
my
weak
state
;
I
shed
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
yes
,
my
father
,
''
replied
I
;
``
some
destiny
of
the
most
horrible
*NL*
kind
hangs
over
me
,
and
I
must
live
to
fulfil
it
,
or
surely
I
should
*NL*
have
died
on
the
coffin
of
Henry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
not
allowed
to
converse
for
any
length
of
time
,
for
the
*NL*
precarious
state
of
my
health
rendered
every
precaution
necessary
that
*NL*
could
insure
tranquillity
.
Mr.
Kirwin
came
in
,
and
insisted
that
my
*NL*
strength
should
not
be
exhausted
by
too
much
exertion
.
But
the
*NL*
appearance
of
my
father
was
to
me
like
that
of
my
good
angel
,
and
I
*NL*
gradually
recovered
my
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
sickness
quitted
me
,
I
was
absorbed
by
a
gloomy
and
black
*NL*
melancholy
,
that
nothing
could
dissipate
.
The
image
of
Clerval
was
for
*NL*
ever
before
me
,
ghastly
and
murdered
.
More
than
once
the
agitation
into
*NL*
which
these
reflections
threw
me
made
my
friends
dread
a
dangerous
*NL*
relapse
.
Alas
!
why
did
they
preserve
so
miserable
and
detested
a
life
?
*NL*
It
was
surely
that
I
might
fulfil
my
destiny
,
which
is
now
drawing
to
a
*NL*
close
.
Soon
,
oh
,
very
soon
,
will
death
extinguish
these
throbbings
,
and
*NL*
relieve
me
from
the
mighty
weight
of
anguish
that
bears
me
to
the
dust
;
*NL*
and
,
in
executing
the
award
of
justice
,
I
shall
also
sink
to
rest
.
Then
*NL*
the
appearance
of
death
was
distant
,
although
the
wish
was
ever
present
*NL*
to
my
thoughts
;
and
I
often
sat
for
hours
motionless
and
speechless
,
*NL*
wishing
for
some
mighty
revolution
that
might
bury
me
and
my
destroyer
*NL*
in
its
ruins
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
season
of
the
assizes
approached
.
I
had
already
been
three
months
*NL*
in
prison
;
and
although
I
was
still
weak
,
and
in
continual
danger
of
a
*NL*
relapse
,
I
was
obliged
to
travel
nearly
a
hundred
miles
to
the
*NL*
county-town
,
where
the
court
was
held
.
Mr.
Kirwin
charged
himself
with
*NL*
every
care
of
collecting
witnesses
,
and
arranging
my
defence
.
I
was
*NL*
spared
the
disgrace
of
appearing
publicly
as
a
criminal
,
as
the
case
was
*NL*
not
brought
before
the
court
that
decides
on
life
and
death
.
The
grand
*NL*
jury
rejected
the
bill
,
on
its
being
proved
that
I
was
on
the
Orkney
*NL*
Islands
at
the
hour
the
body
of
my
friend
was
found
,
and
a
fortnight
*NL*
after
my
removal
I
was
liberated
from
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
was
enraptured
on
finding
me
freed
from
the
vexations
of
a
*NL*
criminal
charge
,
that
I
was
again
allowed
to
breathe
the
fresh
*NL*
atmosphere
,
and
allowed
to
return
to
my
native
country
.
I
did
not
*NL*
participate
in
these
feelings
;
for
to
me
the
walls
of
a
dungeon
or
a
*NL*
palace
were
alike
hateful
.
The
cup
of
life
was
poisoned
for
ever
;
and
*NL*
although
the
sun
shone
upon
me
,
as
upon
the
happy
and
gay
of
heart
,
I
*NL*
saw
around
me
nothing
but
a
dense
and
frightful
darkness
,
penetrated
by
*NL*
no
light
but
the
glimmer
of
two
eyes
that
glared
upon
me
.
Sometimes
they
*NL*
were
the
expressive
eyes
of
Henry
,
languishing
in
death
,
the
dark
orbs
*NL*
nearly
covered
by
the
lids
,
and
the
long
black
lashes
that
fringed
them
;
*NL*
sometimes
it
was
the
watery
clouded
eyes
of
the
monster
,
as
I
first
saw
*NL*
them
in
my
chamber
at
Ingolstadt
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
tried
to
awaken
in
me
the
feelings
of
affection
.
He
talked
of
*NL*
Geneva
,
which
I
should
soon
visit
--
of
Elizabeth
,
and
Ernest
;
but
these
*NL*
words
only
drew
deep
groans
from
me
.
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
I
felt
a
wish
*NL*
for
happiness
;
and
thought
,
with
melancholy
delight
,
of
my
beloved
*NL*
cousin
;
or
longed
,
with
a
devouring
_
maladie
du
pays
_
,
to
see
once
more
*NL*
the
blue
lake
and
rapid
Rhone
,
that
had
been
so
dear
to
me
in
early
*NL*
childhood
:
but
my
general
state
of
feeling
was
a
torpor
,
in
which
a
*NL*
prison
was
as
welcome
a
residence
as
the
divinest
scene
in
nature
;
and
*NL*
these
fits
were
seldom
interrupted
,
but
by
paroxysms
of
anguish
and
*NL*
despair
.
At
these
moments
I
often
endeavoured
to
put
an
end
to
the
*NL*
existence
I
loathed
;
and
it
required
unceasing
attendance
and
vigilance
*NL*
to
restrain
me
from
committing
some
dreadful
act
of
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
,
as
I
quitted
the
prison
,
I
heard
one
of
the
men
say
,
``
He
may
*NL*
be
innocent
of
the
murder
,
but
he
has
certainly
a
bad
conscience
.
''
These
*NL*
words
struck
me
.
A
bad
conscience
!
yes
,
surely
I
had
one
.
William
,
*NL*
Justine
,
and
Clerval
,
had
died
through
my
infernal
machinations
;
``
And
*NL*
whose
death
,
''
cried
I
,
``
is
to
finish
the
tragedy
?
Ah
!
my
father
,
do
not
*NL*
remain
in
this
wretched
country
;
take
me
where
I
may
forget
myself
,
my
*NL*
existence
,
and
all
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
easily
acceded
to
my
desire
;
and
,
after
having
taken
leave
of
*NL*
Mr.
Kirwin
,
we
hastened
to
Dublin
.
I
felt
as
if
I
was
relieved
from
a
*NL*
heavy
weight
,
when
the
packet
sailed
with
a
fair
wind
from
Ireland
,
and
*NL*
I
had
quitted
for
ever
the
country
which
had
been
to
me
the
scene
of
so
*NL*
much
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
midnight
.
My
father
slept
in
the
cabin
;
and
I
lay
on
the
deck
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
stars
,
and
listening
to
the
dashing
of
the
waves
.
I
*NL*
hailed
the
darkness
that
shut
Ireland
from
my
sight
,
and
my
pulse
beat
*NL*
with
a
feverish
joy
,
when
I
reflected
that
I
should
soon
see
Geneva
.
The
*NL*
past
appeared
to
me
in
the
light
of
a
frightful
dream
;
yet
the
vessel
in
*NL*
which
I
was
,
the
wind
that
blew
me
from
the
detested
shore
of
Ireland
,
*NL*
and
the
sea
which
surrounded
me
,
told
me
too
forcibly
that
I
was
*NL*
deceived
by
no
vision
,
and
that
Clerval
,
my
friend
and
dearest
*NL*
companion
,
had
fallen
a
victim
to
me
and
the
monster
of
my
creation
.
I
*NL*
repassed
,
in
my
memory
,
my
whole
life
;
my
quiet
happiness
while
residing
*NL*
with
my
family
in
Geneva
,
the
death
of
my
mother
,
and
my
departure
for
*NL*
Ingolstadt
.
I
remembered
shuddering
at
the
mad
enthusiasm
that
hurried
*NL*
me
on
to
the
creation
of
my
hideous
enemy
,
and
I
called
to
mind
the
*NL*
night
during
which
he
first
lived
.
I
was
unable
to
pursue
the
train
of
*NL*
thought
;
a
thousand
feelings
pressed
upon
me
,
and
I
wept
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
since
my
recovery
from
the
fever
I
had
been
in
the
custom
of
taking
*NL*
every
night
a
small
quantity
of
laudanum
;
for
it
was
by
means
of
this
*NL*
drug
only
that
I
was
enabled
to
gain
the
rest
necessary
for
the
*NL*
preservation
of
life
.
Oppressed
by
the
recollection
of
my
various
*NL*
misfortunes
,
I
now
took
a
double
dose
,
and
soon
slept
profoundly
.
But
*NL*
sleep
did
not
afford
me
respite
from
thought
and
misery
;
my
dreams
*NL*
presented
a
thousand
objects
that
scared
me
.
Towards
morning
I
was
*NL*
possessed
by
a
kind
of
night-mare
;
I
felt
the
fiend
's
grasp
in
my
neck
,
*NL*
and
could
not
free
myself
from
it
;
groans
and
cries
rung
in
my
ears
.
My
*NL*
father
,
who
was
watching
over
me
,
perceiving
my
restlessness
,
awoke
me
,
*NL*
and
pointed
to
the
port
of
Holyhead
,
which
we
were
now
entering
.

CHAPTER
V
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
resolved
not
to
go
to
London
,
but
to
cross
the
country
to
*NL*
Portsmouth
,
and
thence
to
embark
for
Havre
.
I
preferred
this
plan
*NL*
principally
because
I
dreaded
to
see
again
those
places
in
which
I
had
*NL*
enjoyed
a
few
moments
of
tranquillity
with
my
beloved
Clerval
.
I
thought
*NL*
with
horror
of
seeing
again
those
persons
whom
we
had
been
accustomed
to
*NL*
visit
together
,
and
who
might
make
inquiries
concerning
an
event
,
the
*NL*
very
remembrance
of
which
made
me
again
feel
the
pang
I
endured
when
I
*NL*
gazed
on
his
lifeless
form
in
the
inn
at
--
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
my
father
,
his
desires
and
exertions
were
bounded
to
the
again
*NL*
seeing
me
restored
to
health
and
peace
of
mind
.
His
tenderness
and
*NL*
attentions
were
unremitting
;
my
grief
and
gloom
was
obstinate
,
but
he
*NL*
would
not
despair
.
Sometimes
he
thought
that
I
felt
deeply
the
*NL*
degradation
of
being
obliged
to
answer
a
charge
of
murder
,
and
he
*NL*
endeavoured
to
prove
to
me
the
futility
of
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
my
father
,
''
said
I
,
``
how
little
do
you
know
me
.
Human
beings
,
*NL*
their
feelings
and
passions
,
would
indeed
be
degraded
,
if
such
a
wretch
*NL*
as
I
felt
pride
.
Justine
,
poor
unhappy
Justine
,
was
as
innocent
as
I
,
*NL*
and
she
suffered
the
same
charge
;
she
died
for
it
;
and
I
am
the
cause
*NL*
of
this
--
I
murdered
her
.
William
,
Justine
,
and
Henry
--
they
all
died
by
*NL*
my
hands
.

My
father
had
often
,
during
my
imprisonment
,
heard
me
make
the
same
*NL*
assertion
;
when
I
thus
accused
myself
,
he
sometimes
seemed
to
desire
an
*NL*
explanation
,
and
at
others
he
appeared
to
consider
it
as
caused
by
*NL*
delirium
,
and
that
,
during
my
illness
,
some
idea
of
this
kind
had
*NL*
presented
itself
to
my
imagination
,
the
remembrance
of
which
I
preserved
*NL*
in
my
convalescence
.
I
avoided
explanation
,
and
maintained
a
continual
*NL*
silence
concerning
the
wretch
I
had
created
.
I
had
a
feeling
that
I
*NL*
should
be
supposed
mad
,
and
this
for
ever
chained
my
tongue
,
when
I
*NL*
would
have
given
the
whole
world
to
have
confided
the
fatal
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
occasion
my
father
said
,
with
an
expression
of
unbounded
*NL*
wonder
,
``
What
do
you
mean
,
Victor
?
are
you
mad
?
My
dear
son
,
I
entreat
*NL*
you
never
to
make
such
an
assertion
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
mad
,
''
I
cried
energetically
;
``
the
sun
and
the
heavens
,
who
*NL*
have
viewed
my
operations
,
can
bear
witness
of
my
truth
.
I
am
the
*NL*
assassin
of
those
most
innocent
victims
;
they
died
by
my
machinations
.
A
*NL*
thousand
times
would
I
have
shed
my
own
blood
,
drop
by
drop
,
to
have
*NL*
saved
their
lives
;
but
I
could
not
,
my
father
,
indeed
I
could
not
*NL*
sacrifice
the
whole
human
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conclusion
of
this
speech
convinced
my
father
that
my
ideas
were
*NL*
deranged
,
and
he
instantly
changed
the
subject
of
our
conversation
,
and
*NL*
endeavoured
to
alter
the
course
of
my
thoughts
.
He
wished
as
much
as
*NL*
possible
to
obliterate
the
memory
of
the
scenes
that
had
taken
place
in
*NL*
Ireland
,
and
never
alluded
to
them
,
or
suffered
me
to
speak
of
my
*NL*
misfortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
time
passed
away
I
became
more
calm
:
misery
had
her
dwelling
in
my
*NL*
heart
,
but
I
no
longer
talked
in
the
same
incoherent
manner
of
my
own
*NL*
crimes
;
sufficient
for
me
was
the
consciousness
of
them
.
By
the
utmost
*NL*
self-violence
,
I
curbed
the
imperious
voice
of
wretchedness
,
which
*NL*
sometimes
desired
to
declare
itself
to
the
whole
world
;
and
my
manners
*NL*
were
calmer
and
more
composed
than
they
had
ever
been
since
my
journey
*NL*
to
the
sea
of
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
arrived
at
Havre
on
the
8th
of
May
,
and
instantly
proceeded
to
Paris
,
*NL*
where
my
father
had
some
business
which
detained
us
a
few
weeks
.
In
this
*NL*
city
,
I
received
the
following
letter
from
Elizabeth
:
--

_
To

*NL*
*NL*
``
MY
DEAREST
FRIEND
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gave
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
receive
a
letter
from
my
uncle
*NL*
dated
at
Paris
;
you
are
no
longer
at
a
formidable
distance
,
and
I
may
*NL*
hope
to
see
you
in
less
than
a
fortnight
.
My
poor
cousin
,
how
much
you
*NL*
must
have
suffered
!
I
expect
to
see
you
looking
even
more
ill
than
when
*NL*
you
quitted
Geneva
.
This
winter
has
been
passed
most
miserably
,
tortured
*NL*
as
I
have
been
by
anxious
suspense
;
yet
I
hope
to
see
peace
in
your
*NL*
countenance
,
and
to
find
that
your
heart
is
not
totally
devoid
of
*NL*
comfort
and
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
fear
that
the
same
feelings
now
exist
that
made
you
so
miserable
*NL*
a
year
ago
,
even
perhaps
augmented
by
time
.
I
would
not
disturb
you
at
*NL*
this
period
,
when
so
many
misfortunes
weigh
upon
you
;
but
a
conversation
*NL*
that
I
had
with
my
uncle
previous
to
his
departure
renders
some
*NL*
explanation
necessary
before
we
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explanation
!
you
may
possibly
say
;
what
can
Elizabeth
have
to
explain
?
*NL*
If
you
really
say
this
,
my
questions
are
answered
,
and
I
have
no
more
to
*NL*
do
than
to
sign
myself
your
affectionate
cousin
.
But
you
are
distant
*NL*
from
me
,
and
it
is
possible
that
you
may
dread
,
and
yet
be
pleased
with
*NL*
this
explanation
;
and
,
in
a
probability
of
this
being
the
case
,
I
dare
*NL*
not
any
longer
postpone
writing
what
,
during
your
absence
,
I
have
often
*NL*
wished
to
express
to
you
,
but
have
never
had
the
courage
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
well
know
,
Victor
,
that
our
union
had
been
the
favourite
plan
of
*NL*
your
parents
ever
since
our
infancy
.
We
were
told
this
when
young
,
and
*NL*
taught
to
look
forward
to
it
as
an
event
that
would
certainly
take
*NL*
place
.
We
were
affectionate
playfellows
during
childhood
,
and
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
dear
and
valued
friends
to
one
another
as
we
grew
older
.
But
as
*NL*
brother
and
sister
often
entertain
a
lively
affection
towards
each
*NL*
other
,
without
desiring
a
more
intimate
union
,
may
not
such
also
be
our
*NL*
case
?
Tell
me
,
dearest
Victor
.
Answer
me
,
I
conjure
you
,
by
our
mutual
*NL*
happiness
,
with
simple
truth
--
Do
you
not
love
another
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
travelled
;
you
have
spent
several
years
of
your
life
at
*NL*
Ingolstadt
;
and
I
confess
to
you
,
my
friend
,
that
when
I
saw
you
last
*NL*
autumn
so
unhappy
,
flying
to
solitude
,
from
the
society
of
every
*NL*
creature
,
I
could
not
help
supposing
that
you
might
regret
our
*NL*
connexion
,
and
believe
yourself
bound
in
honour
to
fulfil
the
wishes
of
*NL*
your
parents
,
although
they
opposed
themselves
to
your
inclinations
.
But
*NL*
this
is
false
reasoning
.
I
confess
to
you
,
my
cousin
,
that
I
love
you
,
*NL*
and
that
in
my
airy
dreams
of
futurity
you
have
been
my
constant
friend
*NL*
and
companion
.
But
it
is
your
happiness
I
desire
as
well
as
my
own
,
when
*NL*
I
declare
to
you
,
that
our
marriage
would
render
me
eternally
miserable
,
*NL*
unless
it
were
the
dictate
of
your
own
free
choice
.
Even
now
I
weep
to
*NL*
think
,
that
,
borne
down
as
you
are
by
the
cruelest
misfortunes
,
you
may
*NL*
stifle
;
by
the
word
_
honour
_
,
all
hope
of
that
love
and
happiness
which
*NL*
would
alone
restore
you
to
yourself
.
I
,
who
have
so
interested
an
*NL*
affection
for
you
,
may
increase
your
miseries
ten-fold
,
by
being
an
*NL*
obstacle
to
your
wishes
.
Ah
,
Victor
,
be
assured
that
your
cousin
and
*NL*
playmate
has
too
sincere
a
love
for
you
not
to
be
made
miserable
by
this
*NL*
supposition
.
Be
happy
,
my
friend
;
and
if
you
obey
me
in
this
one
*NL*
request
,
remain
satisfied
that
nothing
on
earth
will
have
the
power
to
*NL*
interrupt
my
tranquillity

This
letter
revived
in
my
memory
what
I
had
before
forgotten
,
the
threat
*NL*
of
the
fiend
--
''
_
I
will
be
with
you
on
your
wedding-night
!
_
''
Such
was
my
*NL*
sentence
,
and
on
that
night
would
the
daemon
employ
every
art
to
destroy
*NL*
me
,
and
tear
me
from
the
glimpse
of
happiness
which
promised
partly
to
*NL*
console
my
sufferings
.
On
that
night
he
had
determined
to
consummate
his
*NL*
crimes
by
my
death
.
Well
,
be
it
so
;
a
deadly
struggle
would
then
*NL*
assuredly
take
place
,
in
which
if
he
was
victorious
,
I
should
be
at
*NL*
peace
,
and
his
power
over
me
be
at
an
end
.
If
he
were
vanquished
,
I
*NL*
should
be
a
free
man
.
Alas
!
what
freedom
?
such
as
the
peasant
enjoys
*NL*
when
his
family
have
been
massacred
before
his
eyes
,
his
cottage
burnt
,
*NL*
his
lands
laid
waste
,
and
he
is
turned
adrift
,
homeless
,
pennyless
,
and
*NL*
alone
,
but
free
.
Such
would
be
my
liberty
,
except
that
in
my
Elizabeth
I
*NL*
possessed
a
treasure
;
alas
!
balanced
by
those
horrors
of
remorse
and
*NL*
guilt
,
which
would
pursue
me
until
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sweet
and
beloved
Elizabeth
!
I
read
and
re-read
her
letter
,
and
some
*NL*
softened
feelings
stole
into
my
heart
,
and
dared
to
whisper
paradisaical
*NL*
dreams
of
love
and
joy
;
but
the
apple
was
already
eaten
,
and
the
*NL*
angel
's
arm
bared
to
drive
me
from
all
hope
.
Yet
I
would
die
to
make
her
*NL*
happy
.
If
the
monster
executed
his
threat
,
death
was
inevitable
;
yet
,
*NL*
again
,
I
considered
whether
my
marriage
would
hasten
my
fate
.
My
*NL*
destruction
might
indeed
arrive
a
few
months
sooner
;
but
if
my
torturer
*NL*
should
suspect
that
I
postponed
it
,
influenced
by
his
menaces
,
he
would
*NL*
surely
find
other
,
and
perhaps
more
dreadful
means
of
revenge
.
He
had
*NL*
vowed
_
to
be
with
me
on
my
wedding-night
_
,
yet
he
did
not
consider
that
*NL*
threat
as
binding
him
to
peace
in
the
mean
time
;
for
,
as
if
to
shew
me
*NL*
that
he
was
not
yet
satiated
with
blood
,
he
had
murdered
Clerval
*NL*
immediately
after
the
enunciation
of
his
threats
.
I
resolved
,
therefore
,
*NL*
that
if
my
immediate
union
with
my
cousin
would
conduce
either
to
her
's
*NL*
or
my
father
's
happiness
,
my
adversary
's
designs
against
my
life
should
*NL*
not
retard
it
a
single
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
mind
I
wrote
to
Elizabeth
.
My
letter
was
calm
and
*NL*
affectionate
.
``
I
fear
,
my
beloved
girl
,
''
I
said
,
``
little
happiness
*NL*
remains
for
us
on
earth
;
yet
all
that
I
may
one
day
enjoy
is
concentered
*NL*
in
you
.
Chase
away
your
idle
fears
;
to
you
alone
do
I
consecrate
my
*NL*
life
,
and
my
endeavours
for
contentment
.
I
have
one
secret
,
Elizabeth
,
a
*NL*
dreadful
one
;
when
revealed
to
you
,
it
will
chill
your
frame
with
*NL*
horror
,
and
then
,
far
from
being
surprised
at
my
misery
,
you
will
only
*NL*
wonder
that
I
survive
what
I
have
endured
.
I
will
confide
this
tale
of
*NL*
misery
and
terror
to
you
the
day
after
our
marriage
shall
take
place
;
*NL*
for
,
my
sweet
cousin
,
there
must
be
perfect
confidence
between
us
.
But
*NL*
until
then
,
I
conjure
you
,
do
not
mention
or
allude
to
it
.
This
I
most
*NL*
earnestly
entreat
,
and
I
know
you
will
comply

*NL*
*NL*
In
about
a
week
after
the
arrival
of
Elizabeth
's
letter
,
we
returned
to
*NL*
Geneva
.
My
cousin
welcomed
me
with
warm
affection
;
yet
tears
were
in
her
*NL*
eyes
,
as
she
beheld
my
emaciated
frame
and
feverish
cheeks
.
I
saw
a
*NL*
change
in
her
also
.
She
was
thinner
,
and
had
lost
much
of
that
heavenly
*NL*
vivacity
that
had
before
charmed
me
;
but
her
gentleness
,
and
soft
looks
*NL*
of
compassion
,
made
her
a
more
fit
companion
for
one
blasted
and
*NL*
miserable
as
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tranquillity
which
I
now
enjoyed
did
not
endure
.
Memory
brought
*NL*
madness
with
it
;
and
when
I
thought
on
what
had
passed
,
a
real
insanity
*NL*
possessed
me
;
sometimes
I
was
furious
,
and
burnt
with
rage
,
sometimes
*NL*
low
and
despondent
.
I
neither
spoke
or
looked
,
but
sat
motionless
,
*NL*
bewildered
by
the
multitude
of
miseries
that
overcame
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
alone
had
the
power
to
draw
me
from
these
fits
;
her
gentle
*NL*
voice
would
soothe
me
when
transported
by
passion
,
and
inspire
me
with
*NL*
human
feelings
when
sunk
in
torpor
.
She
wept
with
me
,
and
for
me
.
When
*NL*
reason
returned
,
she
would
remonstrate
,
and
endeavour
to
inspire
me
with
*NL*
resignation
.
Ah
!
it
is
well
for
the
unfortunate
to
be
resigned
,
but
for
*NL*
the
guilty
there
is
no
peace
.
The
agonies
of
remorse
poison
the
luxury
*NL*
there
is
otherwise
sometimes
found
in
indulging
the
excess
of
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
my
arrival
my
father
spoke
of
my
immediate
marriage
with
my
*NL*
cousin
.
I
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
,
then
,
some
other
attachment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
on
earth
.
I
love
Elizabeth
,
and
look
forward
to
our
union
with
*NL*
delight
.
Let
the
day
therefore
be
fixed
;
and
on
it
I
will
consecrate
*NL*
myself
,
in
life
or
death
,
to
the
happiness
of
my
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Victor
,
do
not
speak
thus
.
Heavy
misfortunes
have
befallen
us
;
*NL*
but
let
us
only
cling
closer
to
what
remains
,
and
transfer
our
love
for
*NL*
those
whom
we
have
lost
to
those
who
yet
live
.
Our
circle
will
be
small
,
*NL*
but
bound
close
by
the
ties
of
affection
and
mutual
misfortune
.
And
when
*NL*
time
shall
have
softened
your
despair
,
new
and
dear
objects
of
care
will
*NL*
be
born
to
replace
those
of
whom
we
have
been
so
cruelly
deprived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
lessons
of
my
father
.
But
to
me
the
remembrance
of
the
*NL*
threat
returned
:
nor
can
you
wonder
,
that
,
omnipotent
as
the
fiend
had
*NL*
yet
been
in
his
deeds
of
blood
,
I
should
almost
regard
him
as
*NL*
invincible
;
and
that
when
he
had
pronounced
the
words
,
''
_
I
shall
be
with
*NL*
you
on
your
wedding-night
_
,
''
I
should
regard
the
threatened
fate
as
*NL*
unavoidable
.
But
death
was
no
evil
to
me
,
if
the
loss
of
Elizabeth
were
*NL*
balanced
with
it
;
and
I
therefore
,
with
a
contented
and
even
cheerful
*NL*
countenance
,
agreed
with
my
father
,
that
if
my
cousin
would
consent
,
the
*NL*
ceremony
should
take
place
in
ten
days
,
and
thus
put
,
as
I
imagined
,
the
*NL*
seal
to
my
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
God
!
if
for
one
instant
I
had
thought
what
might
be
the
hellish
*NL*
intention
of
my
fiendish
adversary
,
I
would
rather
have
banished
myself
*NL*
for
ever
from
my
native
country
,
and
wandered
a
friendless
outcast
over
*NL*
the
earth
,
than
have
consented
to
this
miserable
marriage
.
But
,
as
if
*NL*
possessed
of
magic
powers
,
the
monster
had
blinded
me
to
his
real
*NL*
intentions
;
and
when
I
thought
that
I
prepared
only
my
own
death
,
I
*NL*
hastened
that
of
a
far
dearer
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
period
fixed
for
our
marriage
drew
nearer
,
whether
from
cowardice
*NL*
or
a
prophetic
feeling
,
I
felt
my
heart
sink
within
me
.
But
I
concealed
*NL*
my
feelings
by
an
appearance
of
hilarity
,
that
brought
smiles
and
joy
to
*NL*
the
countenance
of
my
father
,
but
hardly
deceived
the
ever-watchful
and
*NL*
nicer
eye
of
Elizabeth
.
She
looked
forward
to
our
union
with
placid
*NL*
contentment
,
not
unmingled
with
a
little
fear
,
which
past
misfortunes
*NL*
had
impressed
,
that
what
now
appeared
certain
and
tangible
happiness
,
*NL*
might
soon
dissipate
into
an
airy
dream
,
and
leave
no
trace
but
deep
and
*NL*
everlasting
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Preparations
were
made
for
the
event
;
congratulatory
visits
were
*NL*
received
;
and
all
wore
a
smiling
appearance
.
I
shut
up
,
as
well
as
I
*NL*
could
,
in
my
own
heart
the
anxiety
that
preyed
there
,
and
entered
with
*NL*
seeming
earnestness
into
the
plans
of
my
father
,
although
they
might
*NL*
only
serve
as
the
decorations
of
my
tragedy
.
A
house
was
purchased
for
*NL*
us
near
Cologny
,
by
which
we
should
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
country
,
*NL*
and
yet
be
so
near
Geneva
as
to
see
my
father
every
day
;
who
would
*NL*
still
reside
within
the
walls
,
for
the
benefit
of
Ernest
,
that
he
might
*NL*
follow
his
studies
at
the
schools
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mean
time
I
took
every
precaution
to
defend
my
person
,
in
case
*NL*
the
fiend
should
openly
attack
me
.
I
carried
pistols
and
a
dagger
*NL*
constantly
about
me
,
and
was
ever
on
the
watch
to
prevent
artifice
;
and
*NL*
by
these
means
gained
a
greater
degree
of
tranquillity
.
Indeed
,
as
the
*NL*
period
approached
,
the
threat
appeared
more
as
a
delusion
,
not
to
be
*NL*
regarded
as
worthy
to
disturb
my
peace
,
while
the
happiness
I
hoped
for
*NL*
in
my
marriage
wore
a
greater
appearance
of
certainty
,
as
the
day
fixed
*NL*
for
its
solemnization
drew
nearer
,
and
I
heard
it
continually
spoken
of
*NL*
as
an
occurrence
which
no
accident
could
possibly
prevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
seemed
happy
;
my
tranquil
demeanour
contributed
greatly
to
*NL*
calm
her
mind
.
But
on
the
day
that
was
to
fulfil
my
wishes
and
my
*NL*
destiny
,
she
was
melancholy
,
and
a
presentiment
of
evil
pervaded
her
;
*NL*
and
perhaps
also
she
thought
of
the
dreadful
secret
,
which
I
had
*NL*
promised
to
reveal
to
her
the
following
day
.
My
father
was
in
the
mean
*NL*
time
overjoyed
,
and
,
in
the
bustle
of
preparation
,
only
observed
in
the
*NL*
melancholy
of
his
niece
the
diffidence
of
a
bride
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
ceremony
was
performed
,
a
large
party
assembled
at
my
*NL*
father
's
;
but
it
was
agreed
that
Elizabeth
and
I
should
pass
the
*NL*
afternoon
and
night
at
Evian
,
and
return
to
Cologny
the
next
morning
.
As
*NL*
the
day
was
fair
,
and
the
wind
favourable
,
we
resolved
to
go
by
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
were
the
last
moments
of
my
life
during
which
I
enjoyed
the
*NL*
feeling
of
happiness
.
We
passed
rapidly
along
:
the
sun
was
hot
,
but
we
*NL*
were
sheltered
from
its
rays
by
a
kind
of
canopy
,
while
we
enjoyed
the
*NL*
beauty
of
the
scene
,
sometimes
on
one
side
of
the
lake
,
where
we
saw
*NL*
Mont
Saleve
,
the
pleasant
banks
of
Montalegre
,
and
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
surmounting
all
,
the
beautiful
Mont
Blanc
,
and
the
assemblage
of
snowy
*NL*
mountains
that
in
vain
endeavour
to
emulate
her
;
sometimes
coasting
the
*NL*
opposite
banks
,
we
saw
the
mighty
Jura
opposing
its
dark
side
to
the
*NL*
ambition
that
would
quit
its
native
country
,
and
an
almost
*NL*
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
invader
who
should
wish
to
enslave
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
hand
of
Elizabeth
:
``
You
are
sorrowful
,
my
love
.
Ah
!
if
you
*NL*
knew
what
I
have
suffered
,
and
what
I
may
yet
endure
,
you
would
*NL*
endeavour
to
let
me
taste
the
quiet
,
and
freedom
from
despair
,
that
this
*NL*
one
day
at
least
permits
me
to
enjoy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
happy
,
my
dear
Victor
,
''
replied
Elizabeth
;
``
there
is
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
nothing
to
distress
you
;
and
be
assured
that
if
a
lively
joy
is
not
*NL*
painted
in
my
face
,
my
heart
is
contented
.
Something
whispers
to
me
not
*NL*
to
depend
too
much
on
the
prospect
that
is
opened
before
us
;
but
I
will
*NL*
not
listen
to
such
a
sinister
voice
.
Observe
how
fast
we
move
along
,
and
*NL*
how
the
clouds
which
sometimes
obscure
,
and
sometimes
rise
above
the
*NL*
dome
of
Mont
Blanc
,
render
this
scene
of
beauty
still
more
interesting
.
*NL*
Look
also
at
the
innumerable
fish
that
are
swimming
in
the
clear
*NL*
waters
,
where
we
can
distinguish
every
pebble
that
lies
at
the
bottom
.
*NL*
What
a
divine
day
!
how
happy
and
serene
all
nature
appears
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Elizabeth
endeavoured
to
divert
her
thoughts
and
mine
from
all
*NL*
reflection
upon
melancholy
subjects
.
But
her
temper
was
fluctuating
;
joy
*NL*
for
a
few
instants
shone
in
her
eyes
,
but
it
continually
gave
place
to
*NL*
distraction
and
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
sunk
lower
in
the
heavens
;
we
passed
the
river
Drance
,
and
*NL*
observed
its
path
through
the
chasms
of
the
higher
,
and
the
glens
of
the
*NL*
lower
hills
.
The
Alps
here
come
closer
to
the
lake
,
and
we
approached
*NL*
the
amphitheatre
of
mountains
which
forms
its
eastern
boundary
.
The
*NL*
spire
of
Evian
shone
under
the
woods
that
surrounded
it
,
and
the
range
*NL*
of
mountain
above
mountain
by
which
it
was
overhung
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
,
which
had
hitherto
carried
us
along
with
amazing
rapidity
,
*NL*
sunk
at
sunset
to
a
light
breeze
;
the
soft
air
just
ruffled
the
water
,
*NL*
and
caused
a
pleasant
motion
among
the
trees
as
we
approached
the
shore
,
*NL*
from
which
it
wafted
the
most
delightful
scent
of
flowers
and
hay
.
The
*NL*
sun
sunk
beneath
the
horizon
as
we
landed
;
and
as
I
touched
the
shore
,
I
*NL*
felt
those
cares
and
fears
revive
,
which
soon
were
to
clasp
me
,
and
*NL*
cling
to
me
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
eight
o'clock
when
we
landed
;
we
walked
for
a
short
time
on
the
*NL*
shore
,
enjoying
the
transitory
light
,
and
then
retired
to
the
inn
,
and
*NL*
contemplated
the
lovely
scene
of
waters
,
woods
,
and
mountains
,
obscured
*NL*
in
darkness
,
yet
still
displaying
their
black
outlines
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
,
which
had
fallen
in
the
south
,
now
rose
with
great
violence
in
*NL*
the
west
.
The
moon
had
reached
her
summit
in
the
heavens
,
and
was
*NL*
beginning
to
descend
;
the
clouds
swept
across
it
swifter
than
the
flight
*NL*
of
the
vulture
,
and
dimmed
her
rays
,
while
the
lake
reflected
the
scene
*NL*
of
the
busy
heavens
,
rendered
still
busier
by
the
restless
waves
that
*NL*
were
beginning
to
rise
.
Suddenly
a
heavy
storm
of
rain
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
calm
during
the
day
;
but
so
soon
as
night
obscured
the
shapes
*NL*
of
objects
,
a
thousand
fears
arose
in
my
mind
.
I
was
anxious
and
*NL*
watchful
,
while
my
right
hand
grasped
a
pistol
which
was
hidden
in
my
*NL*
bosom
;
every
sound
terrified
me
;
but
I
resolved
that
I
would
sell
my
*NL*
life
dearly
,
and
not
relax
the
impending
conflict
until
my
own
life
,
or
*NL*
that
of
my
adversary
,
were
extinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
observed
my
agitation
for
some
time
in
timid
and
fearful
*NL*
silence
;
at
length
she
said
,
``
What
is
it
that
agitates
you
,
my
dear
*NL*
Victor
?
What
is
it
you
fear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
peace
,
peace
,
my
love
,
''
replied
I
,
``
this
night
,
and
all
will
be
*NL*
safe
:
but
this
night
is
dreadful
,
very
dreadful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
passed
an
hour
in
this
state
of
mind
,
when
suddenly
I
reflected
how
*NL*
dreadful
the
combat
which
I
momentarily
expected
would
be
to
my
wife
,
*NL*
and
I
earnestly
entreated
her
to
retire
,
resolving
not
to
join
her
until
*NL*
I
had
obtained
some
knowledge
as
to
the
situation
of
my
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
me
,
and
I
continued
some
time
walking
up
and
down
the
passages
*NL*
of
the
house
,
and
inspecting
every
corner
that
might
afford
a
retreat
to
*NL*
my
adversary
.
But
I
discovered
no
trace
of
him
,
and
was
beginning
to
*NL*
conjecture
that
some
fortunate
chance
had
intervened
to
prevent
the
*NL*
execution
of
his
menaces
;
when
suddenly
I
heard
a
shrill
and
dreadful
*NL*
scream
.
It
came
from
the
room
into
which
Elizabeth
had
retired
.
As
I
*NL*
heard
it
,
the
whole
truth
rushed
into
my
mind
,
my
arms
dropped
,
the
*NL*
motion
of
every
muscle
and
fibre
was
suspended
;
I
could
feel
the
blood
*NL*
trickling
in
my
veins
,
and
tingling
in
the
extremities
of
my
limbs
.
This
*NL*
state
lasted
but
for
an
instant
;
the
scream
was
repeated
,
and
I
rushed
*NL*
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
God
!
why
did
I
not
then
expire
!
Why
am
I
here
to
relate
the
*NL*
destruction
of
the
best
hope
,
and
the
purest
creature
of
earth
.
She
was
*NL*
there
,
lifeless
and
inanimate
,
thrown
across
the
bed
,
her
head
hanging
*NL*
down
,
and
her
pale
and
distorted
features
half
covered
by
her
hair
.
*NL*
Every
where
I
turn
I
see
the
same
figure
--
her
bloodless
arms
and
relaxed
*NL*
form
flung
by
the
murderer
on
its
bridal
bier
.
Could
I
behold
this
,
and
*NL*
live
?
Alas
!
life
is
obstinate
,
and
clings
closest
where
it
is
most
*NL*
hated
.
For
a
moment
only
did
I
lose
recollection
;
I
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
recovered
,
I
found
myself
surrounded
by
the
people
of
the
inn
;
*NL*
their
countenances
expressed
a
breathless
terror
:
but
the
horror
of
*NL*
others
appeared
only
as
a
mockery
,
a
shadow
of
the
feelings
that
*NL*
oppressed
me
.
I
escaped
from
them
to
the
room
where
lay
the
body
of
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
my
love
,
my
wife
,
so
lately
living
,
so
dear
,
so
worthy
.
She
*NL*
had
been
moved
from
the
posture
in
which
I
had
first
beheld
her
;
and
*NL*
now
,
as
she
lay
,
her
head
upon
her
arm
,
and
a
handkerchief
thrown
across
*NL*
her
face
and
neck
,
I
might
have
supposed
her
asleep
.
I
rushed
towards
*NL*
her
,
and
embraced
her
with
ardour
;
but
the
deathly
languor
and
coldness
*NL*
of
the
limbs
told
me
,
that
what
I
now
held
in
my
arms
had
ceased
to
be
*NL*
the
Elizabeth
whom
I
had
loved
and
cherished
.
The
murderous
mark
of
the
*NL*
fiend
's
grasp
was
on
her
neck
,
and
the
breath
had
ceased
to
issue
from
*NL*
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
still
hung
over
her
in
the
agony
of
despair
,
I
happened
to
look
*NL*
up
.
The
windows
of
the
room
had
before
been
darkened
;
and
I
felt
a
kind
*NL*
of
panic
on
seeing
the
pale
yellow
light
of
the
moon
illuminate
the
*NL*
chamber
.
The
shutters
had
been
thrown
back
;
and
,
with
a
sensation
of
*NL*
horror
not
to
be
described
,
I
saw
at
the
open
window
a
figure
the
most
*NL*
hideous
and
abhorred
.
A
grin
was
on
the
face
of
the
monster
;
he
seemed
*NL*
to
jeer
,
as
with
his
fiendish
finger
he
pointed
towards
the
corpse
of
my
*NL*
wife
.
I
rushed
towards
the
window
,
and
drawing
a
pistol
from
my
bosom
,
*NL*
shot
;
but
he
eluded
me
,
leaped
from
his
station
,
and
,
running
with
the
*NL*
swiftness
of
lightning
,
plunged
into
the
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
report
of
the
pistol
brought
a
crowd
into
the
room
.
I
pointed
to
the
*NL*
spot
where
he
had
disappeared
,
and
we
followed
the
track
with
boats
;
*NL*
nets
were
cast
,
but
in
vain
.
After
passing
several
hours
,
we
returned
*NL*
hopeless
,
most
of
my
companions
believing
it
to
have
been
a
form
*NL*
conjured
by
my
fancy
.
After
having
landed
,
they
proceeded
to
search
the
*NL*
country
,
parties
going
in
different
directions
among
the
woods
and
*NL*
vines
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
accompany
them
;
I
was
exhausted
:
a
film
covered
my
eyes
,
and
*NL*
my
skin
was
parched
with
the
heat
of
fever
.
In
this
state
I
lay
on
a
*NL*
bed
,
hardly
conscious
of
what
had
happened
;
my
eyes
wandered
round
the
*NL*
room
,
as
if
to
seek
something
that
I
had
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
I
remembered
that
my
father
would
anxiously
expect
the
return
*NL*
of
Elizabeth
and
myself
,
and
that
I
must
return
alone
.
This
reflection
*NL*
brought
tears
into
my
eyes
,
and
I
wept
for
a
long
time
;
but
my
thoughts
*NL*
rambled
to
various
subjects
,
reflecting
on
my
misfortunes
,
and
their
*NL*
cause
.
I
was
bewildered
in
a
cloud
of
wonder
and
horror
.
The
death
of
*NL*
William
,
the
execution
of
Justine
,
the
murder
of
Clerval
,
and
lastly
of
*NL*
my
wife
;
even
at
that
moment
I
knew
not
that
my
only
remaining
friends
*NL*
were
safe
from
the
malignity
of
the
fiend
;
my
father
even
now
might
be
*NL*
writhing
under
his
grasp
,
and
Ernest
might
be
dead
at
his
feet
.
This
*NL*
idea
made
me
shudder
,
and
recalled
me
to
action
.
I
started
up
,
and
*NL*
resolved
to
return
to
Geneva
with
all
possible
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
horses
to
be
procured
,
and
I
must
return
by
the
lake
;
but
*NL*
the
wind
was
unfavourable
,
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
.
However
,
it
*NL*
was
hardly
morning
,
and
I
might
reasonably
hope
to
arrive
by
night
.
I
*NL*
hired
men
to
row
,
and
took
an
oar
myself
,
for
I
had
always
experienced
*NL*
relief
from
mental
torment
in
bodily
exercise
.
But
the
overflowing
*NL*
misery
I
now
felt
,
and
the
excess
of
agitation
that
I
endured
,
rendered
*NL*
me
incapable
of
any
exertion
.
I
threw
down
the
oar
;
and
,
leaning
my
head
*NL*
upon
my
hands
,
gave
way
to
every
gloomy
idea
that
arose
.
If
I
looked
up
,
*NL*
I
saw
the
scenes
which
were
familiar
to
me
in
my
happier
time
,
and
which
*NL*
I
had
contemplated
but
the
day
before
in
the
company
of
her
who
was
now
*NL*
but
a
shadow
and
a
recollection
.
Tears
streamed
from
my
eyes
.
The
rain
*NL*
had
ceased
for
a
moment
,
and
I
saw
the
fish
play
in
the
waters
as
they
*NL*
had
done
a
few
hours
before
;
they
had
then
been
observed
by
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
Nothing
is
so
painful
to
the
human
mind
as
a
great
and
sudden
change
.
*NL*
The
sun
might
shine
,
or
the
clouds
might
lour
;
but
nothing
could
appear
*NL*
to
me
as
it
had
done
the
day
before
.
A
fiend
had
snatched
from
me
every
*NL*
hope
of
future
happiness
:
no
creature
had
ever
been
so
miserable
as
I
*NL*
was
;
so
frightful
an
event
is
single
in
the
history
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
why
should
I
dwell
upon
the
incidents
that
followed
this
last
*NL*
overwhelming
event
.
Mine
has
been
a
tale
of
horrors
;
I
have
reached
*NL*
their
_
acme
_
,
and
what
I
must
now
relate
can
but
be
tedious
to
you
.
Know
*NL*
that
,
one
by
one
,
my
friends
were
snatched
away
;
I
was
left
desolate
.
My
*NL*
own
strength
is
exhausted
;
and
I
must
tell
,
in
a
few
words
,
what
remains
*NL*
of
my
hideous
narration
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
arrived
at
Geneva
.
My
father
and
Ernest
yet
lived
;
but
the
former
sunk
*NL*
under
the
tidings
that
I
bore
.
I
see
him
now
,
excellent
and
venerable
*NL*
old
man
!
his
eyes
wandered
in
vacancy
,
for
they
had
lost
their
charm
and
*NL*
their
delight
--
his
niece
,
his
more
than
daughter
,
whom
he
doated
on
with
*NL*
all
that
affection
which
a
man
feels
,
who
,
in
the
decline
of
life
,
*NL*
having
few
affections
,
clings
more
earnestly
to
those
that
remain
.
*NL*
Cursed
,
cursed
be
the
fiend
that
brought
misery
on
his
grey
hairs
,
and
*NL*
doomed
him
to
waste
in
wretchedness
!
He
could
not
live
under
the
horrors
*NL*
that
were
accumulated
around
him
;
an
apoplectic
fit
was
brought
on
,
and
*NL*
in
a
few
days
he
died
in
my
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
then
became
of
me
?
I
know
not
;
I
lost
sensation
,
and
chains
and
*NL*
darkness
were
the
only
objects
that
pressed
upon
me
.
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
*NL*
I
dreamt
that
I
wandered
in
flowery
meadows
and
pleasant
vales
with
the
*NL*
friends
of
my
youth
;
but
awoke
,
and
found
myself
in
a
dungeon
.
*NL*
Melancholy
followed
,
but
by
degrees
I
gained
a
clear
conception
of
my
*NL*
miseries
and
situation
,
and
was
then
released
from
my
prison
.
For
they
*NL*
had
called
me
mad
;
and
during
many
months
,
as
I
understood
,
a
solitary
*NL*
cell
had
been
my
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
liberty
had
been
a
useless
gift
to
me
had
I
not
,
as
I
awakened
to
*NL*
reason
,
at
the
same
time
awakened
to
revenge
.
As
the
memory
of
past
*NL*
misfortunes
pressed
upon
me
,
I
began
to
reflect
on
their
cause
--
the
*NL*
monster
whom
I
had
created
,
the
miserable
daemon
whom
I
had
sent
abroad
*NL*
into
the
world
for
my
destruction
.
I
was
possessed
by
a
maddening
rage
*NL*
when
I
thought
of
him
,
and
desired
and
ardently
prayed
that
I
might
have
*NL*
him
within
my
grasp
to
wreak
a
great
and
signal
revenge
on
his
cursed
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
my
hate
long
confine
itself
to
useless
wishes
;
I
began
to
*NL*
reflect
on
the
best
means
of
securing
him
;
and
for
this
purpose
,
about
a
*NL*
month
after
my
release
,
I
repaired
to
a
criminal
judge
in
the
town
,
and
*NL*
told
him
that
I
had
an
accusation
to
make
;
that
I
knew
the
destroyer
of
*NL*
my
family
;
and
that
I
required
him
to
exert
his
whole
authority
for
the
*NL*
apprehension
of
the
murderer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
magistrate
listened
to
me
with
attention
and
kindness
:
``
Be
assured
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
no
pains
or
exertions
on
my
part
shall
be
spared
to
*NL*
discover
the
villain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
''
replied
I
;
``
listen
,
therefore
,
to
the
deposition
that
I
*NL*
have
to
make
.
It
is
indeed
a
tale
so
strange
,
that
I
should
fear
you
*NL*
would
not
credit
it
,
were
there
not
something
in
truth
which
,
however
*NL*
wonderful
,
forces
conviction
.
The
story
is
too
connected
to
be
mistaken
*NL*
for
a
dream
,
and
I
have
no
motive
for
falsehood
.
''
My
manner
,
as
I
thus
*NL*
addressed
him
,
was
impressive
,
but
calm
;
I
had
formed
in
my
own
heart
a
*NL*
resolution
to
pursue
my
destroyer
to
death
;
and
this
purpose
quieted
my
*NL*
agony
,
and
provisionally
reconciled
me
to
life
.
I
now
related
my
history
*NL*
briefly
,
but
with
firmness
and
precision
,
marking
the
dates
with
*NL*
accuracy
,
and
never
deviating
into
invective
or
exclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
magistrate
appeared
at
first
perfectly
incredulous
,
but
as
I
*NL*
continued
he
became
more
attentive
and
interested
;
I
saw
him
sometimes
*NL*
shudder
with
horror
,
at
others
a
lively
surprise
,
unmingled
with
*NL*
disbelief
,
was
painted
on
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
concluded
my
narration
,
I
said
.
``
This
is
the
being
whom
I
*NL*
accuse
,
and
for
whose
detection
and
punishment
I
call
upon
you
to
exert
*NL*
your
whole
power
.
It
is
your
duty
as
a
magistrate
,
and
I
believe
and
*NL*
hope
that
your
feelings
as
a
man
will
not
revolt
from
the
execution
of
*NL*
those
functions
on
this
occasion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
address
caused
a
considerable
change
in
the
physiognomy
of
my
*NL*
auditor
.
He
had
heard
my
story
with
that
half
kind
of
belief
that
is
*NL*
given
to
a
tale
of
spirits
and
supernatural
events
;
but
when
he
was
*NL*
called
upon
to
act
officially
in
consequence
,
the
whole
tide
of
his
*NL*
incredulity
returned
.
He
,
however
,
answered
mildly
,
``
I
would
willingly
*NL*
afford
you
every
aid
in
your
pursuit
;
but
the
creature
of
whom
you
*NL*
speak
appears
to
have
powers
which
would
put
all
my
exertions
to
*NL*
defiance
.
Who
can
follow
an
animal
which
can
traverse
the
sea
of
ice
,
*NL*
and
inhabit
caves
and
dens
,
where
no
man
would
venture
to
intrude
?
*NL*
Besides
,
some
months
have
elapsed
since
the
commission
of
his
crimes
,
*NL*
and
no
one
can
conjecture
to
what
place
he
has
wandered
,
or
what
region
*NL*
he
may
now
inhabit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
doubt
that
he
hovers
near
the
spot
which
I
inhabit
;
and
if
he
*NL*
has
indeed
taken
refuge
in
the
Alps
,
he
may
be
hunted
like
the
chamois
,
*NL*
and
destroyed
as
a
beast
of
prey
.
But
I
perceive
your
thoughts
:
you
do
*NL*
not
credit
my
narrative
,
and
do
not
intend
to
pursue
my
enemy
with
the
*NL*
punishment
which
is
his
desert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
spoke
,
rage
sparkled
in
my
eyes
;
the
magistrate
was
intimidated
;
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
will
exert
myself
;
and
if
it
is
in
my
*NL*
power
to
seize
the
monster
,
be
assured
that
he
shall
suffer
punishment
*NL*
proportionate
to
his
crimes
.
But
I
fear
,
from
what
you
have
yourself
*NL*
described
to
be
his
properties
,
that
this
will
prove
impracticable
,
and
*NL*
that
,
while
every
proper
measure
is
pursued
,
you
should
endeavour
to
*NL*
make
up
your
mind
to
disappointment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
can
not
be
;
but
all
that
I
can
say
will
be
of
little
avail
.
My
*NL*
revenge
is
of
no
moment
to
you
;
yet
,
while
I
allow
it
to
be
a
vice
,
I
*NL*
confess
that
it
is
the
devouring
and
only
passion
of
my
soul
.
My
rage
is
*NL*
unspeakable
,
when
I
reflect
that
the
murderer
,
whom
I
have
turned
loose
*NL*
upon
society
,
still
exists
.
You
refuse
my
just
demand
:
I
have
but
one
*NL*
resource
;
and
I
devote
myself
,
either
in
my
life
or
death
,
to
his
*NL*
destruction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
with
excess
of
agitation
as
I
said
this
;
there
was
a
phrenzy
*NL*
in
my
manner
,
and
something
,
I
doubt
not
,
of
that
haughty
fierceness
,
*NL*
which
the
martyrs
of
old
are
said
to
have
possessed
.
But
to
a
Genevan
*NL*
magistrate
,
whose
mind
was
occupied
by
far
other
ideas
than
those
of
*NL*
devotion
and
heroism
,
this
elevation
of
mind
had
much
the
appearance
of
*NL*
madness
.
He
endeavoured
to
soothe
me
as
a
nurse
does
a
child
,
and
*NL*
reverted
to
my
tale
as
the
effects
of
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
,
''
I
cried
,
``
how
ignorant
art
thou
in
thy
pride
of
wisdom
!
Cease
;
*NL*
you
know
not
what
it
is
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
broke
from
the
house
angry
and
disturbed
,
and
retired
to
meditate
on
*NL*
some
other
mode
of
action
.

CHAPTER
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
present
situation
was
one
in
which
all
voluntary
thought
was
*NL*
swallowed
up
and
lost
.
I
was
hurried
away
by
fury
;
revenge
alone
endowed
*NL*
me
with
strength
and
composure
;
it
modelled
my
feelings
,
and
allowed
me
*NL*
to
be
calculating
and
calm
,
at
periods
when
otherwise
delirium
or
death
*NL*
would
have
been
my
portion
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
resolution
was
to
quit
Geneva
for
ever
;
my
country
,
which
,
when
*NL*
I
was
happy
and
beloved
,
was
dear
to
me
,
now
,
in
my
adversity
,
became
*NL*
hateful
.
I
provided
myself
with
a
sum
of
money
,
together
with
a
few
*NL*
jewels
which
had
belonged
to
my
mother
,
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
my
wanderings
began
,
which
are
to
cease
but
with
life
.
I
have
*NL*
traversed
a
vast
portion
of
the
earth
,
and
have
endured
all
the
*NL*
hardships
which
travellers
,
in
deserts
and
barbarous
countries
,
are
wont
*NL*
to
meet
.
How
I
have
lived
I
hardly
know
;
many
times
have
I
stretched
my
*NL*
failing
limbs
upon
the
sandy
plain
,
and
prayed
for
death
.
But
revenge
*NL*
kept
me
alive
;
I
dared
not
die
,
and
leave
my
adversary
in
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
quitted
Geneva
,
my
first
labour
was
to
gain
some
clue
by
which
I
*NL*
might
trace
the
steps
of
my
fiendish
enemy
.
But
my
plan
was
unsettled
;
*NL*
and
I
wandered
many
hours
around
the
confines
of
the
town
,
uncertain
*NL*
what
path
I
should
pursue
.
As
night
approached
,
I
found
myself
at
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
cemetery
where
William
,
Elizabeth
,
and
my
father
,
*NL*
reposed
.
I
entered
it
,
and
approached
the
tomb
which
marked
their
*NL*
graves
.
Every
thing
was
silent
,
except
the
leaves
of
the
trees
,
which
*NL*
were
gently
agitated
by
the
wind
;
the
night
was
nearly
dark
;
and
the
*NL*
scene
would
have
been
solemn
and
affecting
even
to
an
uninterested
*NL*
observer
.
The
spirits
of
the
departed
seemed
to
flit
around
,
and
to
cast
*NL*
a
shadow
,
which
was
felt
but
seen
not
,
around
the
head
of
the
mourner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deep
grief
which
this
scene
had
at
first
excited
quickly
gave
way
to
*NL*
rage
and
despair
.
They
were
dead
,
and
I
lived
;
their
murderer
also
*NL*
lived
,
and
to
destroy
him
I
must
drag
out
my
weary
existence
.
I
knelt
on
*NL*
the
grass
,
and
kissed
the
earth
,
and
with
quivering
lips
exclaimed
,
``
By
*NL*
the
sacred
earth
on
which
I
kneel
,
by
the
shades
that
wander
near
me
,
by
*NL*
the
deep
and
eternal
grief
that
I
feel
,
I
swear
;
and
by
thee
,
O
Night
,
*NL*
and
by
the
spirits
that
preside
over
thee
,
I
swear
to
pursue
the
daemon
,
*NL*
who
caused
this
misery
,
until
he
or
I
shall
perish
in
mortal
conflict
.
*NL*
For
this
purpose
I
will
preserve
my
life
:
to
execute
this
dear
revenge
,
*NL*
will
I
again
behold
the
sun
,
and
tread
the
green
herbage
of
earth
,
which
*NL*
otherwise
should
vanish
from
my
eyes
for
ever
.
And
I
call
on
you
,
*NL*
spirits
of
the
dead
;
and
on
you
,
wandering
ministers
of
vengeance
,
to
*NL*
aid
and
conduct
me
in
my
work
.
Let
the
cursed
and
hellish
monster
drink
*NL*
deep
of
agony
;
let
him
feel
the
despair
that
now
torments
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
begun
my
adjuration
with
solemnity
,
and
an
awe
which
almost
*NL*
assured
me
that
the
shades
of
my
murdered
friends
heard
and
approved
my
*NL*
devotion
;
but
the
furies
possessed
me
as
I
concluded
,
and
rage
choaked
*NL*
my
utterance
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
answered
through
the
stillness
of
night
by
a
loud
and
fiendish
*NL*
laugh
.
It
rung
on
my
ears
long
and
heavily
;
the
mountains
re-echoed
it
,
*NL*
and
I
felt
as
if
all
hell
surrounded
me
with
mockery
and
laughter
.
*NL*
Surely
in
that
moment
I
should
have
been
possessed
by
phrenzy
,
and
have
*NL*
destroyed
my
miserable
existence
,
but
that
my
vow
was
heard
,
and
that
I
*NL*
was
reserved
for
vengeance
.
The
laughter
died
away
:
when
a
well-known
*NL*
and
abhorred
voice
,
apparently
close
to
my
ear
,
addressed
me
in
an
*NL*
audible
whisper
--
``
I
am
satisfied
:
miserable
wretch
!
you
have
determined
*NL*
to
live
,
and
I
am
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
darted
towards
the
spot
from
which
the
sound
proceeded
;
but
the
devil
*NL*
eluded
my
grasp
.
Suddenly
the
broad
disk
of
the
moon
arose
,
and
shone
*NL*
full
upon
his
ghastly
and
distorted
shape
,
as
he
fled
with
more
than
*NL*
mortal
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pursued
him
;
and
for
many
months
this
has
been
my
task
.
Guided
by
a
*NL*
slight
clue
,
I
followed
the
windings
of
the
Rhone
,
but
vainly
.
The
blue
*NL*
Mediterranean
appeared
;
and
,
by
a
strange
chance
,
I
saw
the
fiend
enter
*NL*
by
night
,
and
hide
himself
in
a
vessel
bound
for
the
Black
Sea
.
I
took
*NL*
my
passage
in
the
same
ship
;
but
he
escaped
,
I
know
not
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amidst
the
wilds
of
Tartary
and
Russia
,
although
he
still
evaded
me
,
I
*NL*
have
ever
followed
in
his
track
.
Sometimes
the
peasants
,
scared
by
this
*NL*
horrid
apparition
,
informed
me
of
his
path
;
sometimes
he
himself
,
who
*NL*
feared
that
if
I
lost
all
trace
I
should
despair
and
die
,
often
left
*NL*
some
mark
to
guide
me
.
The
snows
descended
on
my
head
,
and
I
saw
the
*NL*
print
of
his
huge
step
on
the
white
plain
.
To
you
first
entering
on
*NL*
life
,
to
whom
care
is
new
,
and
agony
unknown
,
how
can
you
understand
*NL*
what
I
have
felt
,
and
still
feel
?
Cold
,
want
,
and
fatigue
,
were
the
least
*NL*
pains
which
I
was
destined
to
endure
;
I
was
cursed
by
some
devil
,
and
*NL*
carried
about
with
me
my
eternal
hell
;
yet
still
a
spirit
of
good
*NL*
followed
and
directed
my
steps
,
and
,
when
I
most
murmured
,
would
*NL*
suddenly
extricate
me
from
seemingly
insurmountable
difficulties
.
*NL*
Sometimes
,
when
nature
,
overcome
by
hunger
,
sunk
under
the
exhaustion
,
a
*NL*
repast
was
prepared
for
me
in
the
desert
,
that
restored
and
inspirited
*NL*
me
.
The
fare
was
indeed
coarse
,
such
as
the
peasants
of
the
country
ate
;
*NL*
but
I
may
not
doubt
that
it
was
set
there
by
the
spirits
that
I
had
*NL*
invoked
to
aid
me
.
Often
,
when
all
was
dry
,
the
heavens
cloudless
,
and
I
*NL*
was
parched
by
thirst
,
a
slight
cloud
would
bedim
the
sky
,
shed
the
few
*NL*
drops
that
revived
me
,
and
vanish
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
,
when
I
could
,
the
courses
of
the
rivers
;
but
the
daemon
*NL*
generally
avoided
these
,
as
it
was
here
that
the
population
of
the
*NL*
country
chiefly
collected
.
In
other
places
human
beings
were
seldom
*NL*
seen
;
and
I
generally
subsisted
on
the
wild
animals
that
crossed
my
*NL*
path
.
I
had
money
with
me
,
and
gained
the
friendship
of
the
villagers
by
*NL*
distributing
it
,
or
bringing
with
me
some
food
that
I
had
killed
,
which
,
*NL*
after
taking
a
small
part
,
I
always
presented
to
those
who
had
provided
*NL*
me
with
fire
and
utensils
for
cooking
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
life
,
as
it
passed
thus
,
was
indeed
hateful
to
me
,
and
it
was
during
*NL*
sleep
alone
that
I
could
taste
joy
.
O
blessed
sleep
!
often
,
when
most
*NL*
miserable
,
I
sank
to
repose
,
and
my
dreams
lulled
me
even
to
rapture
.
*NL*
The
spirits
that
guarded
me
had
provided
these
moments
,
or
rather
hours
,
*NL*
of
happiness
,
that
I
might
retain
strength
to
fulfil
my
pilgrimage
.
*NL*
Deprived
of
this
respite
,
I
should
have
sunk
under
my
hardships
.
During
*NL*
the
day
I
was
sustained
and
inspirited
by
the
hope
of
night
:
for
in
*NL*
sleep
I
saw
my
friends
,
my
wife
,
and
my
beloved
country
;
again
I
saw
the
*NL*
benevolent
countenance
of
my
father
,
heard
the
silver
tones
of
my
*NL*
Elizabeth
's
voice
,
and
beheld
Clerval
enjoying
health
and
youth
.
Often
,
*NL*
when
wearied
by
a
toilsome
march
,
I
persuaded
myself
that
I
was
dreaming
*NL*
until
night
should
come
,
and
that
I
should
then
enjoy
reality
in
the
*NL*
arms
of
my
dearest
friends
.
What
agonizing
fondness
did
I
feel
for
them
!
*NL*
how
did
I
cling
to
their
dear
forms
,
as
sometimes
they
haunted
even
my
*NL*
waking
hours
,
and
persuade
myself
that
they
still
lived
!
At
such
*NL*
moments
vengeance
,
that
burned
within
me
,
died
in
my
heart
,
and
I
*NL*
pursued
my
path
towards
the
destruction
of
the
daemon
,
more
as
a
task
*NL*
enjoined
by
heaven
,
as
the
mechanical
impulse
of
some
power
of
which
I
*NL*
was
unconscious
,
than
as
the
ardent
desire
of
my
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
his
feelings
were
whom
I
pursued
,
I
can
not
know
.
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
*NL*
he
left
marks
in
writing
on
the
barks
of
the
trees
,
or
cut
in
stone
,
*NL*
that
guided
me
,
and
instigated
my
fury
.
``
My
reign
is
not
yet
over
,
''
*NL*
-LRB-
these
words
were
legible
in
one
of
these
inscriptions
-RRB-
;
``
you
live
,
and
*NL*
my
power
is
complete
.
Follow
me
;
I
seek
the
everlasting
ices
of
the
*NL*
north
,
where
you
will
feel
the
misery
of
cold
and
frost
,
to
which
I
am
*NL*
impassive
.
You
will
find
near
this
place
,
if
you
follow
not
too
tardily
,
*NL*
a
dead
hare
;
eat
,
and
be
refreshed
.
Come
on
,
my
enemy
;
we
have
yet
to
*NL*
wrestle
for
our
lives
;
but
many
hard
and
miserable
hours
must
you
*NL*
endure
,
until
that
period
shall
arrive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scoffing
devil
!
Again
do
I
vow
vengeance
;
again
do
I
devote
thee
,
*NL*
miserable
fiend
,
to
torture
and
death
.
Never
will
I
omit
my
search
,
*NL*
until
he
or
I
perish
;
and
then
with
what
ecstacy
shall
I
join
my
*NL*
Elizabeth
,
and
those
who
even
now
prepare
for
me
the
reward
of
my
*NL*
tedious
toil
and
horrible
pilgrimage
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
still
pursued
my
journey
to
the
northward
,
the
snows
thickened
,
and
*NL*
the
cold
increased
in
a
degree
almost
too
severe
to
support
.
The
*NL*
peasants
were
shut
up
in
their
hovels
,
and
only
a
few
of
the
most
hardy
*NL*
ventured
forth
to
seize
the
animals
whom
starvation
had
forced
from
*NL*
their
hiding-places
to
seek
for
prey
.
The
rivers
were
covered
with
ice
,
*NL*
and
no
fish
could
be
procured
;
and
thus
I
was
cut
off
from
my
chief
*NL*
article
of
maintenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
triumph
of
my
enemy
increased
with
the
difficulty
of
my
labours
.
One
*NL*
inscription
that
he
left
was
in
these
words
:
``
Prepare
!
your
toils
only
*NL*
begin
:
wrap
yourself
in
furs
,
and
provide
food
,
for
we
shall
soon
enter
*NL*
upon
a
journey
where
your
sufferings
will
satisfy
my
everlasting
*NL*
hatred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
courage
and
perseverance
were
invigorated
by
these
scoffing
words
;
I
*NL*
resolved
not
to
fail
in
my
purpose
;
and
,
calling
on
heaven
to
support
*NL*
me
,
I
continued
with
unabated
fervour
to
traverse
immense
deserts
,
until
*NL*
the
ocean
appeared
at
a
distance
,
and
formed
the
utmost
boundary
of
the
*NL*
horizon
.
Oh
!
how
unlike
it
was
to
the
blue
seas
of
the
south
!
Covered
*NL*
with
ice
,
it
was
only
to
be
distinguished
from
land
by
its
superior
*NL*
wildness
and
ruggedness
.
The
Greeks
wept
for
joy
when
they
beheld
the
*NL*
Mediterranean
from
the
hills
of
Asia
,
and
hailed
with
rapture
the
*NL*
boundary
of
their
toils
.
I
did
not
weep
;
but
I
knelt
down
,
and
,
with
a
*NL*
full
heart
,
thanked
my
guiding
spirit
for
conducting
me
in
safety
to
the
*NL*
place
where
I
hoped
,
notwithstanding
my
adversary
's
gibe
,
to
meet
and
*NL*
grapple
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
weeks
before
this
period
I
had
procured
a
sledge
and
dogs
,
and
thus
*NL*
traversed
the
snows
with
inconceivable
speed
.
I
know
not
whether
the
*NL*
fiend
possessed
the
same
advantages
;
but
I
found
that
,
as
before
I
had
*NL*
daily
lost
ground
in
the
pursuit
,
I
now
gained
on
him
;
so
much
so
,
that
*NL*
when
I
first
saw
the
ocean
,
he
was
but
one
day
's
journey
in
advance
,
and
*NL*
I
hoped
to
intercept
him
before
he
should
reach
the
beach
.
With
new
*NL*
courage
,
therefore
,
I
pressed
on
,
and
in
two
days
arrived
at
a
wretched
*NL*
hamlet
on
the
seashore
.
I
inquired
of
the
inhabitants
concerning
the
*NL*
fiend
,
and
gained
accurate
information
.
A
gigantic
monster
,
they
said
,
*NL*
had
arrived
the
night
before
,
armed
with
a
gun
and
many
pistols
;
putting
*NL*
to
flight
the
inhabitants
of
a
solitary
cottage
,
through
fear
of
his
*NL*
terrific
appearance
.
He
had
carried
off
their
store
of
winter
food
,
and
,
*NL*
placing
it
in
a
sledge
,
to
draw
which
he
had
seized
on
a
numerous
drove
*NL*
of
trained
dogs
,
he
had
harnessed
them
,
and
the
same
night
,
to
the
joy
*NL*
of
the
horror-struck
villagers
,
had
pursued
his
journey
across
the
sea
*NL*
in
a
direction
that
led
to
no
land
;
and
they
conjectured
that
he
must
*NL*
speedily
be
destroyed
by
the
breaking
of
the
ice
,
or
frozen
by
the
*NL*
eternal
frosts
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
information
,
I
suffered
a
temporary
access
of
despair
.
*NL*
He
had
escaped
me
;
and
I
must
commence
a
destructive
and
almost
endless
*NL*
journey
across
the
mountainous
ices
of
the
ocean
,
--
amidst
cold
that
few
*NL*
of
the
inhabitants
could
long
endure
,
and
which
I
,
the
native
of
a
*NL*
genial
and
sunny
climate
,
could
not
hope
to
survive
.
Yet
at
the
idea
*NL*
that
the
fiend
should
live
and
be
triumphant
,
my
rage
and
vengeance
*NL*
returned
,
and
,
like
a
mighty
tide
,
overwhelmed
every
other
feeling
.
*NL*
After
a
slight
repose
,
during
which
the
spirits
of
the
dead
hovered
*NL*
round
,
and
instigated
me
to
toil
and
revenge
,
I
prepared
for
my
*NL*
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
exchanged
my
land
sledge
for
one
fashioned
for
the
inequalities
of
the
*NL*
frozen
ocean
;
and
,
purchasing
a
plentiful
stock
of
provisions
,
I
*NL*
departed
from
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
guess
how
many
days
have
passed
since
then
;
but
I
have
endured
*NL*
misery
,
which
nothing
but
the
eternal
sentiment
of
a
just
retribution
*NL*
burning
within
my
heart
could
have
enabled
me
to
support
.
Immense
and
*NL*
rugged
mountains
of
ice
often
barred
up
my
passage
,
and
I
often
heard
*NL*
the
thunder
of
the
ground
sea
,
which
threatened
my
destruction
.
But
*NL*
again
the
frost
came
,
and
made
the
paths
of
the
sea
secure
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
quantity
of
provision
which
I
had
consumed
I
should
guess
that
I
*NL*
had
passed
three
weeks
in
this
journey
;
and
the
continual
protraction
of
*NL*
hope
,
returning
back
upon
the
heart
,
often
wrung
bitter
drops
of
*NL*
despondency
and
grief
from
my
eyes
.
Despair
had
indeed
almost
secured
*NL*
her
prey
,
and
I
should
soon
have
sunk
beneath
this
misery
;
when
once
,
*NL*
after
the
poor
animals
that
carried
me
had
with
incredible
toil
gained
*NL*
the
summit
of
a
sloping
ice
mountain
,
and
one
sinking
under
his
fatigue
*NL*
died
,
I
viewed
the
expanse
before
me
with
anguish
,
when
suddenly
my
eye
*NL*
caught
a
dark
speck
upon
the
dusky
plain
.
I
strained
my
sight
to
*NL*
discover
what
it
could
be
,
and
uttered
a
wild
cry
of
ecstacy
when
I
*NL*
distinguished
a
sledge
,
and
the
distorted
proportions
of
a
well-known
*NL*
form
within
.
Oh
!
with
what
a
burning
gush
did
hope
revisit
my
heart
!
*NL*
warm
tears
filled
my
eyes
,
which
I
hastily
wiped
away
,
that
they
might
*NL*
not
intercept
the
view
I
had
of
the
daemon
;
but
still
my
sight
was
dimmed
*NL*
by
the
burning
drops
,
until
,
giving
way
to
the
emotions
that
oppressed
*NL*
me
,
I
wept
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
the
time
for
delay
;
I
disencumbered
the
dogs
of
their
*NL*
dead
companion
,
gave
them
a
plentiful
portion
of
food
;
and
,
after
an
*NL*
hour
's
rest
,
which
was
absolutely
necessary
,
and
yet
which
was
bitterly
*NL*
irksome
to
me
,
I
continued
my
route
.
The
sledge
was
still
visible
;
nor
*NL*
did
I
again
lose
sight
of
it
,
except
at
the
moments
when
for
a
short
*NL*
time
some
ice
rock
concealed
it
with
its
intervening
crags
.
I
indeed
*NL*
perceptibly
gained
on
it
;
and
when
,
after
nearly
two
days
'
journey
,
I
*NL*
beheld
my
enemy
at
no
more
than
a
mile
distant
,
my
heart
bounded
within
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
when
I
appeared
almost
within
grasp
of
my
enemy
,
my
hopes
were
*NL*
suddenly
extinguished
,
and
I
lost
all
trace
of
him
more
utterly
than
I
*NL*
had
ever
done
before
.
A
ground
sea
was
heard
;
the
thunder
of
its
*NL*
progress
,
as
the
waters
rolled
and
swelled
beneath
me
,
became
every
*NL*
moment
more
ominous
and
terrific
.
I
pressed
on
,
but
in
vain
.
The
wind
*NL*
arose
;
the
sea
roared
;
and
,
as
with
the
mighty
shock
of
an
earthquake
,
*NL*
it
split
,
and
cracked
with
a
tremendous
and
overwhelming
sound
.
The
work
*NL*
was
soon
finished
:
in
a
few
minutes
a
tumultuous
sea
rolled
between
me
*NL*
and
my
enemy
,
and
I
was
left
drifting
on
a
scattered
piece
of
ice
,
that
*NL*
was
continually
lessening
,
and
thus
preparing
for
me
a
hideous
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
many
appalling
hours
passed
;
several
of
my
dogs
died
;
and
*NL*
I
myself
was
about
to
sink
under
the
accumulation
of
distress
,
when
I
*NL*
saw
your
vessel
riding
at
anchor
,
and
holding
forth
to
me
hopes
of
*NL*
succour
and
life
.
I
had
no
conception
that
vessels
ever
came
so
far
*NL*
north
,
and
was
astounded
at
the
sight
.
I
quickly
destroyed
part
of
my
*NL*
sledge
to
construct
oars
;
and
by
these
means
was
enabled
,
with
infinite
*NL*
fatigue
,
to
move
my
ice-raft
in
the
direction
of
your
ship
.
I
had
*NL*
determined
,
if
you
were
going
southward
,
still
to
trust
myself
to
the
*NL*
mercy
of
the
seas
,
rather
than
abandon
my
purpose
.
I
hoped
to
induce
you
*NL*
to
grant
me
a
boat
with
which
I
could
still
pursue
my
enemy
.
But
your
*NL*
direction
was
northward
.
You
took
me
on
board
when
my
vigour
was
*NL*
exhausted
,
and
I
should
soon
have
sunk
under
my
multiplied
hardships
*NL*
into
a
death
,
which
I
still
dread
,
--
for
my
task
is
unfulfilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
when
will
my
guiding
spirit
,
in
conducting
me
to
the
daemon
,
allow
me
*NL*
the
rest
I
so
much
desire
;
or
must
I
die
,
and
he
yet
live
?
If
I
do
,
*NL*
swear
to
me
,
Walton
,
that
he
shall
not
escape
;
that
you
will
seek
him
,
*NL*
and
satisfy
my
vengeance
in
his
death
.
Yet
,
do
I
dare
ask
you
to
*NL*
undertake
my
pilgrimage
,
to
endure
the
hardships
that
I
have
undergone
?
*NL*
No
;
I
am
not
so
selfish
.
Yet
,
when
I
am
dead
,
if
he
should
appear
;
if
*NL*
the
ministers
of
vengeance
should
conduct
him
to
you
,
swear
that
he
*NL*
shall
not
live
--
swear
that
he
shall
not
triumph
over
my
accumulated
*NL*
woes
,
and
live
to
make
another
such
a
wretch
as
I
am
.
He
is
eloquent
*NL*
and
persuasive
;
and
once
his
words
had
even
power
over
my
heart
:
but
*NL*
trust
him
not
.
His
soul
is
as
hellish
as
his
form
,
full
of
treachery
and
*NL*
fiend-like
malice
.
Hear
him
not
;
call
on
the
manes
of
William
,
Justine
,
*NL*
Clerval
,
Elizabeth
,
my
father
,
and
of
the
wretched
Victor
,
and
thrust
*NL*
your
sword
into
his
heart
.
I
will
hover
near
,
and
direct
the
steel
*NL*
aright
.

August
26th

--
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
have
read
this
strange
and
terrific
story
,
Margaret
;
and
do
you
not
*NL*
feel
your
blood
congealed
with
horror
,
like
that
which
even
now
curdles
*NL*
mine
?
Sometimes
,
seized
with
sudden
agony
,
he
could
not
continue
his
*NL*
tale
;
at
others
,
his
voice
broken
,
yet
piercing
,
uttered
with
difficulty
*NL*
the
words
so
replete
with
agony
.
His
fine
and
lovely
eyes
were
now
*NL*
lighted
up
with
indignation
,
now
subdued
to
downcast
sorrow
,
and
*NL*
quenched
in
infinite
wretchedness
.
Sometimes
he
commanded
his
*NL*
countenance
and
tones
,
and
related
the
most
horrible
incidents
with
a
*NL*
tranquil
voice
,
suppressing
every
mark
of
agitation
;
then
,
like
a
*NL*
volcano
bursting
forth
,
his
face
would
suddenly
change
to
an
expression
*NL*
of
the
wildest
rage
,
as
he
shrieked
out
imprecations
on
his
persecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tale
is
connected
,
and
told
with
an
appearance
of
the
simplest
*NL*
truth
;
yet
I
own
to
you
that
the
letters
of
Felix
and
Safie
,
which
he
*NL*
shewed
me
,
and
the
apparition
of
the
monster
,
seen
from
our
ship
,
*NL*
brought
to
me
a
greater
conviction
of
the
truth
of
his
narrative
than
*NL*
his
asseverations
,
however
earnest
and
connected
.
Such
a
monster
has
*NL*
then
really
existence
;
I
can
not
doubt
it
;
yet
I
am
lost
in
surprise
and
*NL*
admiration
.
Sometimes
I
endeavoured
to
gain
from
Frankenstein
the
*NL*
particulars
of
his
creature
's
formation
;
but
on
this
point
he
was
*NL*
impenetrable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
mad
,
my
friend
?
''
said
he
,
``
or
whither
does
your
senseless
*NL*
curiosity
lead
you
?
Would
you
also
create
for
yourself
and
the
world
a
*NL*
demoniacal
enemy
?
Or
to
what
do
your
questions
tend
?
Peace
,
peace
!
learn
*NL*
my
miseries
,
and
do
not
seek
to
increase
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frankenstein
discovered
that
I
made
notes
concerning
his
history
:
he
*NL*
asked
to
see
them
,
and
then
himself
corrected
and
augmented
them
in
many
*NL*
places
;
but
principally
in
giving
the
life
and
spirit
to
the
*NL*
conversations
he
held
with
his
enemy
.
``
Since
you
have
preserved
my
*NL*
narration
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
would
not
that
a
mutilated
one
should
go
down
to
*NL*
posterity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
has
a
week
passed
away
,
while
I
have
listened
to
the
strangest
tale
*NL*
that
ever
imagination
formed
.
My
thoughts
,
and
every
feeling
of
my
soul
,
*NL*
have
been
drunk
up
by
the
interest
for
my
guest
,
which
this
tale
,
and
*NL*
his
own
elevated
and
gentle
manners
have
created
.
I
wish
to
soothe
him
;
*NL*
yet
can
I
counsel
one
so
infinitely
miserable
,
so
destitute
of
every
*NL*
hope
of
consolation
,
to
live
?
Oh
,
no
!
the
only
joy
that
he
can
now
know
*NL*
will
be
when
he
composes
his
shattered
feelings
to
peace
and
death
.
Yet
*NL*
he
enjoys
one
comfort
,
the
offspring
of
solitude
and
delirium
:
he
*NL*
believes
,
that
,
when
in
dreams
he
holds
converse
with
his
friends
,
and
*NL*
derives
from
that
communion
consolation
for
his
miseries
,
or
excitements
*NL*
to
his
vengeance
,
that
they
are
not
the
creations
of
his
fancy
,
but
the
*NL*
real
beings
who
visit
him
from
the
regions
of
a
remote
world
.
This
faith
*NL*
gives
a
solemnity
to
his
reveries
that
render
them
to
me
almost
as
*NL*
imposing
and
interesting
as
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
conversations
are
not
always
confined
to
his
own
history
and
*NL*
misfortunes
.
On
every
point
of
general
literature
he
displays
unbounded
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
a
quick
and
piercing
apprehension
.
His
eloquence
is
*NL*
forcible
and
touching
;
nor
can
I
hear
him
,
when
he
relates
a
pathetic
*NL*
incident
,
or
endeavours
to
move
the
passions
of
pity
or
love
,
without
*NL*
tears
.
What
a
glorious
creature
must
he
have
been
in
the
days
of
his
*NL*
prosperity
,
when
he
is
thus
noble
and
godlike
in
ruin
.
He
seems
to
feel
*NL*
his
own
worth
,
and
the
greatness
of
his
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
younger
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
felt
as
if
I
were
destined
for
some
great
*NL*
enterprise
.
My
feelings
are
profound
;
but
I
possessed
a
coolness
of
*NL*
judgment
that
fitted
me
for
illustrious
achievements
.
This
sentiment
of
*NL*
the
worth
of
my
nature
supported
me
,
when
others
would
have
been
*NL*
oppressed
;
for
I
deemed
it
criminal
to
throw
away
in
useless
grief
those
*NL*
talents
that
might
be
useful
to
my
fellow-creatures
.
When
I
reflected
on
*NL*
the
work
I
had
completed
,
no
less
a
one
than
the
creation
of
a
*NL*
sensitive
and
rational
animal
,
I
could
not
rank
myself
with
the
herd
of
*NL*
common
projectors
.
But
this
feeling
,
which
supported
me
in
the
*NL*
commencement
of
my
career
,
now
serves
only
to
plunge
me
lower
in
the
*NL*
dust
.
All
my
speculations
and
hopes
are
as
nothing
;
and
,
like
the
*NL*
archangel
who
aspired
to
omnipotence
,
I
am
chained
in
an
eternal
hell
.
*NL*
My
imagination
was
vivid
,
yet
my
powers
of
analysis
and
application
were
*NL*
intense
;
by
the
union
of
these
qualities
I
conceived
the
idea
,
and
*NL*
executed
the
creation
of
a
man
.
Even
now
I
can
not
recollect
,
without
*NL*
passion
,
my
reveries
while
the
work
was
incomplete
.
I
trod
heaven
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
now
exulting
in
my
powers
,
now
burning
with
the
idea
of
their
*NL*
effects
.
From
my
infancy
I
was
imbued
with
high
hopes
and
a
lofty
*NL*
ambition
;
but
how
am
I
sunk
!
Oh
!
my
friend
,
if
you
had
known
me
as
I
*NL*
once
was
,
you
would
not
recognize
me
in
this
state
of
degradation
.
*NL*
Despondency
rarely
visited
my
heart
;
a
high
destiny
seemed
to
bear
me
*NL*
on
,
until
I
fell
,
never
,
never
again
to
rise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Must
I
then
lose
this
admirable
being
?
I
have
longed
for
a
friend
;
I
*NL*
have
sought
one
who
would
sympathize
with
and
love
me
.
Behold
,
on
these
*NL*
desert
seas
I
have
found
such
a
one
;
but
,
I
fear
,
I
have
gained
him
only
*NL*
to
know
his
value
,
and
lose
him
.
I
would
reconcile
him
to
life
,
but
he
*NL*
repulses
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
Walton
,
''
he
said
,
``
for
your
kind
intentions
towards
so
*NL*
miserable
a
wretch
;
but
when
you
speak
of
new
ties
,
and
fresh
*NL*
affections
,
think
you
that
any
can
replace
those
who
are
gone
?
Can
any
*NL*
man
be
to
me
as
Clerval
was
;
or
any
woman
another
Elizabeth
?
Even
where
*NL*
the
affections
are
not
strongly
moved
by
any
superior
excellence
,
the
*NL*
companions
of
our
childhood
always
possess
a
certain
power
over
our
*NL*
minds
,
which
hardly
any
later
friend
can
obtain
.
They
know
our
infantine
*NL*
dispositions
,
which
,
however
they
may
be
afterwards
modified
,
are
never
*NL*
eradicated
;
and
they
can
judge
of
our
actions
with
more
certain
*NL*
conclusions
as
to
the
integrity
of
our
motives
.
A
sister
or
a
brother
*NL*
can
never
,
unless
indeed
such
symptoms
have
been
shewn
early
,
suspect
*NL*
the
other
of
fraud
or
false
dealing
,
when
another
friend
,
however
*NL*
strongly
he
may
be
attached
,
may
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
be
invaded
with
*NL*
suspicion
.
But
I
enjoyed
friends
,
dear
not
only
through
habit
and
*NL*
association
,
but
from
their
own
merits
;
and
,
wherever
I
am
,
the
soothing
*NL*
voice
of
my
Elizabeth
,
and
the
conversation
of
Clerval
,
will
be
ever
*NL*
whispered
in
my
ear
.
They
are
dead
;
and
but
one
feeling
in
such
a
*NL*
solitude
can
persuade
me
to
preserve
my
life
.
If
I
were
engaged
in
any
*NL*
high
undertaking
or
design
,
fraught
with
extensive
utility
to
my
*NL*
fellow-creatures
,
then
could
I
live
to
fulfil
it
.
But
such
is
not
my
*NL*
destiny
;
I
must
pursue
and
destroy
the
being
to
whom
I
gave
existence
;
*NL*
then
my
lot
on
earth
will
be
fulfilled
,
and
I
may
die
.

MY
BELOVED

*NL*
*NL*
I
write
to
you
,
encompassed
by
peril
,
and
ignorant
whether
I
am
ever
*NL*
doomed
to
see
again
dear
England
,
and
the
dearer
friends
that
inhabit
*NL*
it

I
am
surrounded
by
mountains
of
ice
,
which
admit
of
no
escape
,
and
*NL*
threaten
every
moment
to
crush
my
vessel
.
The
brave
fellows
,
whom
I
have
*NL*
persuaded
to
be
my
companions
,
look
towards
me
for
aid
;
but
I
have
none
*NL*
to
bestow
.
There
is
something
terribly
appalling
in
our
situation
,
yet
*NL*
my
courage
and
hopes
do
not
desert
me

We
may
survive

and
if
we
do
not

*NL*
I
will
repeat
the
lessons
of
my
Seneca
,
and
die
with
a
good
heart

*NL*
*NL*
Yet
what
,
Margaret
,
will
be
the
state
of
your
mind
?
You
will
not
hear
of
*NL*
my
destruction
,
and
you
will
anxiously
await
my
return
.
Years
will
pass
,
*NL*
and
you
will
have
visitings
of
despair
,
and
yet
be
tortured
by
hope
.
Oh

*NL*
my
beloved
sister
,
the
sickening
failings
of
your
heart-felt
*NL*
expectations
are
,
in
prospect
,
more
terrible
to
me
than
my
own
death
.
*NL*
But
you
have
a
husband
,
and
lovely
children

you
may
be
happy

heaven

bless

make

*NL*
*NL*
My
unfortunate
guest
regards
me
with
the
tenderest
compassion
.
He
*NL*
endeavours
to
fill
me
with
hope
;
and
talks
as
if
life
were
a
possession
*NL*
which
he
valued
.
He
reminds
me
how
often
the
same
accidents
have
*NL*
happened
to
other
navigators
,
who
have
attempted
this
sea
,
and
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
myself
,
he
fills
me
with
cheerful
auguries
.
Even
the
sailors
feel
the
*NL*
power
of
his
eloquence
:
when
he
speaks
,
they
no
longer
despair
:
he
*NL*
rouses
their
energies
,
and
,
while
they
hear
his
voice
,
they
believe
*NL*
these
vast
mountains
of
ice
are
mole-hills
,
which
will
vanish
before
the
*NL*
resolutions
of
man
.
These
feelings
are
transitory
;
each
day
's
*NL*
expectation
delayed
fills
them
with
fear
,
and
I
almost
dread
a
mutiny
*NL*
caused
by
this
despair
.

A
scene
has
just
passed
of
such
uncommon
interest
,
that
although
it
is
*NL*
highly
probable
that
these
papers
may
never
reach
you
,
yet
I
can
not
*NL*
forbear
recording
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
still
surrounded
by
mountains
of
ice
,
still
in
imminent
danger
of
*NL*
being
crushed
in
their
conflict
.
The
cold
is
excessive
,
and
many
of
my
*NL*
unfortunate
comrades
have
already
found
a
grave
amidst
this
scene
of
*NL*
desolation
.
Frankenstein
has
daily
declined
in
health
:
a
feverish
fire
*NL*
still
glimmers
in
his
eyes
;
but
he
is
exhausted
,
and
,
when
suddenly
*NL*
roused
to
any
exertion
,
he
speedily
sinks
again
into
apparent
*NL*
lifelessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mentioned
in
my
last
letter
the
fears
I
entertained
of
a
mutiny
.
This
*NL*
morning
,
as
I
sat
watching
the
wan
countenance
of
my
friend
--
his
eyes
*NL*
half
closed
,
and
his
limbs
hanging
listlessly
,
--
I
was
roused
by
half
a
*NL*
dozen
of
the
sailors
,
who
desired
admission
into
the
cabin
.
They
*NL*
entered
;
and
their
leader
addressed
me
.
He
told
me
that
he
and
his
*NL*
companions
had
been
chosen
by
the
other
sailors
to
come
in
deputation
to
*NL*
me
,
to
make
me
a
demand
,
which
,
in
justice
,
I
could
not
refuse
.
We
were
*NL*
immured
in
ice
,
and
should
probably
never
escape
;
but
they
feared
that
*NL*
if
,
as
was
possible
,
the
ice
should
dissipate
,
and
a
free
passage
be
*NL*
opened
,
I
should
be
rash
enough
to
continue
my
voyage
,
and
lead
them
*NL*
into
fresh
dangers
,
after
they
might
happily
have
surmounted
this
.
They
*NL*
desired
,
therefore
,
that
I
should
engage
with
a
solemn
promise
,
that
if
*NL*
the
vessel
should
be
freed
,
I
would
instantly
direct
my
coarse
*NL*
southward
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
troubled
me
.
I
had
not
despaired
;
nor
had
I
yet
conceived
*NL*
the
idea
of
returning
,
if
set
free
.
Yet
could
I
,
in
justice
,
or
even
in
*NL*
possibility
,
refuse
this
demand
?
I
hesitated
before
I
answered
;
when
*NL*
Frankenstein
,
who
had
at
first
been
silent
,
and
,
indeed
,
appeared
hardly
*NL*
to
have
force
enough
to
attend
,
now
roused
himself
;
his
eyes
sparkled
,
*NL*
and
his
cheeks
flushed
with
momentary
vigour
.
Turning
towards
the
men
,
*NL*
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
What
do
you
demand
of
your
captain
?
Are
you
then
so
*NL*
easily
turned
from
your
design
?
Did
you
not
call
this
a
glorious
*NL*
expedition
?
and
wherefore
was
it
glorious
?
Not
because
the
way
was
*NL*
smooth
and
placid
as
a
southern
sea
,
but
because
it
was
full
of
dangers
*NL*
and
terror
;
because
,
at
every
new
incident
,
your
fortitude
was
to
be
*NL*
called
forth
,
and
your
courage
exhibited
;
because
danger
and
death
*NL*
surrounded
,
and
these
dangers
you
were
to
brave
and
overcome
.
For
this
*NL*
was
it
a
glorious
,
for
this
was
it
an
honourable
undertaking
.
You
were
*NL*
hereafter
to
be
hailed
as
the
benefactors
of
your
species
;
your
name
*NL*
adored
,
as
belonging
to
brave
men
who
encountered
death
for
honour
and
*NL*
the
benefit
of
mankind
.
And
now
,
behold
,
with
the
first
imagination
of
*NL*
danger
,
or
,
if
you
will
,
the
first
mighty
and
terrific
trial
of
your
*NL*
courage
,
you
shrink
away
,
and
are
content
to
be
handed
down
as
men
who
*NL*
had
not
strength
enough
to
endure
cold
and
peril
;
and
so
,
poor
souls
,
*NL*
they
were
chilly
,
and
returned
to
their
warm
fire-sides
.
Why
,
that
*NL*
requires
not
this
preparation
;
ye
need
not
have
come
thus
far
,
and
*NL*
dragged
your
captain
to
the
shame
of
a
defeat
,
merely
to
prove
*NL*
yourselves
cowards
.
Oh
!
be
men
,
or
be
more
than
men
.
Be
steady
to
your
*NL*
purposes
,
and
firm
as
a
rock
.
This
ice
is
not
made
of
such
stuff
as
your
*NL*
hearts
might
be
;
it
is
mutable
,
can
not
withstand
you
,
if
you
say
that
it
*NL*
shall
not
.
Do
not
return
to
your
families
with
the
stigma
of
disgrace
*NL*
marked
on
your
brows
.
Return
as
heroes
who
have
fought
and
conquered
,
*NL*
and
who
know
not
what
it
is
to
turn
their
backs
on
the
foe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
this
with
a
voice
so
modulated
to
the
different
feelings
*NL*
expressed
in
his
speech
,
with
an
eye
so
full
of
lofty
design
and
*NL*
heroism
,
that
can
you
wonder
that
these
men
were
moved
.
They
looked
at
*NL*
one
another
,
and
were
unable
to
reply
.
I
spoke
;
I
told
them
to
retire
,
*NL*
and
consider
of
what
had
been
said
:
that
I
would
not
lead
them
further
*NL*
north
,
if
they
strenuously
desired
the
contrary
;
but
that
I
hoped
that
,
*NL*
with
reflection
,
their
courage
would
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
retired
,
and
I
turned
towards
my
friend
;
but
he
was
sunk
in
*NL*
languor
,
and
almost
deprived
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
all
this
will
terminate
,
I
know
not
;
but
I
had
rather
die
,
than
*NL*
return
shamefully
,
--
my
purpose
unfulfilled
.
Yet
I
fear
such
will
be
my
*NL*
fate
;
the
men
,
unsupported
by
ideas
of
glory
and
honour
,
can
never
*NL*
willingly
continue
to
endure
their
present
hardships
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
September
7th
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
die
is
cast
;
I
have
consented
to
return
,
if
we
are
not
destroyed
.
*NL*
Thus
are
my
hopes
blasted
by
cowardice
and
indecision
;
I
come
back
*NL*
ignorant
and
disappointed
.
It
requires
more
philosophy
than
I
possess
,
*NL*
to
bear
this
injustice
with
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*

*
*

*NL*
*NL*
September
12th
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
past
;
I
am
returning
to
England
.
I
have
lost
my
hopes
of
utility
*NL*
and
glory
;
--
I
have
lost
my
friend
.
But
I
will
endeavour
to
detail
these
*NL*
bitter
circumstances
to
you
,
my
dear
sister
;
and
,
while
I
am
wafted
*NL*
towards
England
,
and
towards
you
,
I
will
not
despond
.
*NL*
*NL*
September
19th
,
the
ice
began
to
move
,
and
roarings
like
thunder
were
*NL*
heard
at
a
distance
,
as
the
islands
split
and
cracked
in
every
*NL*
direction
.
We
were
in
the
most
imminent
peril
;
but
,
as
we
could
only
*NL*
remain
passive
,
my
chief
attention
was
occupied
by
my
unfortunate
guest
,
*NL*
whose
illness
increased
in
such
a
degree
,
that
he
was
entirely
confined
*NL*
to
his
bed
.
The
ice
cracked
behind
us
,
and
was
driven
with
force
towards
*NL*
the
north
;
a
breeze
sprung
from
the
west
,
and
on
the
11th
the
passage
*NL*
towards
the
south
became
perfectly
free
.
When
the
sailors
saw
this
,
and
*NL*
that
their
return
to
their
native
country
was
apparently
assured
,
a
*NL*
shout
of
tumultuous
joy
broke
from
,
them
,
loud
and
long-continued
.
*NL*
Frankenstein
,
who
was
dozing
,
awoke
,
and
asked
the
cause
of
the
tumult
.
*NL*
``
They
shout
,
''
I
said
,
``
because
they
will
soon
return
to
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
then
really
return
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
yes
;
I
can
not
withstand
their
demands
.
I
can
not
lead
them
*NL*
unwillingly
to
danger
,
and
I
must
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
so
,
if
you
will
;
but
I
will
not
.
You
may
give
up
your
purpose
;
but
*NL*
mine
is
assigned
to
me
by
heaven
,
and
I
dare
not
.
I
am
weak
;
but
surely
*NL*
the
spirits
who
assist
my
vengeance
will
endow
me
with
sufficient
*NL*
strength
.
''
Saying
this
,
he
endeavoured
to
spring
from
the
bed
,
but
the
*NL*
exertion
was
too
great
for
him
;
he
fell
back
,
and
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
before
he
was
restored
;
and
I
often
thought
that
life
was
*NL*
entirely
extinct
.
At
length
he
opened
his
eyes
,
but
he
breathed
with
*NL*
difficulty
,
and
was
unable
to
speak
.
The
surgeon
gave
him
a
composing
*NL*
draught
,
and
ordered
us
to
leave
him
undisturbed
.
In
the
mean
time
he
*NL*
told
me
,
that
my
friend
had
certainly
not
many
hours
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
sentence
was
pronounced
;
and
I
could
only
grieve
,
and
be
patient
.
I
*NL*
sat
by
his
bed
watching
him
;
his
eyes
were
closed
,
and
I
thought
he
*NL*
slept
;
but
presently
he
called
to
me
in
a
feeble
voice
,
and
,
bidding
me
*NL*
come
near
,
said
--
``
Alas
!
the
strength
I
relied
on
is
gone
;
I
feel
that
I
*NL*
shall
soon
die
,
and
he
,
my
enemy
and
persecutor
,
may
still
be
in
being
.
*NL*
Think
not
,
Walton
,
that
in
the
last
moments
of
my
existence
I
feel
that
*NL*
burning
hatred
,
and
ardent
desire
of
revenge
,
I
once
expressed
,
but
I
*NL*
feel
myself
justified
in
desiring
the
death
of
my
adversary
.
During
*NL*
these
last
days
I
have
been
occupied
in
examining
my
past
conduct
;
nor
*NL*
do
I
find
it
blameable
.
In
a
fit
of
enthusiastic
madness
I
created
a
*NL*
rational
creature
,
and
was
bound
towards
him
,
to
assure
,
as
far
as
was
*NL*
in
my
power
,
his
happiness
and
well-being
.
This
was
my
duty
;
but
there
*NL*
was
another
still
paramount
to
that
.
My
duties
towards
my
*NL*
fellow-creatures
had
greater
claims
to
my
attention
,
because
they
*NL*
included
a
greater
proportion
of
happiness
or
misery
.
Urged
by
this
*NL*
view
,
I
refused
,
and
I
did
right
in
refusing
,
to
create
a
companion
for
*NL*
the
first
creature
.
He
shewed
unparalleled
malignity
and
selfishness
,
in
*NL*
evil
:
he
destroyed
my
friends
;
he
devoted
to
destruction
beings
who
*NL*
possessed
exquisite
sensations
,
happiness
,
and
wisdom
;
nor
do
I
know
*NL*
where
this
thirst
for
vengeance
may
end
.
Miserable
himself
,
that
he
may
*NL*
render
no
other
wretched
,
he
ought
to
die
.
The
task
of
his
destruction
*NL*
was
mine
,
but
I
have
failed
.
When
actuated
by
selfish
and
vicious
*NL*
motives
,
I
asked
you
to
undertake
my
unfinished
work
;
and
I
renew
this
*NL*
request
now
,
when
I
am
only
induced
by
reason
and
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
can
not
ask
you
to
renounce
your
country
and
friends
,
to
fulfil
*NL*
this
task
;
and
now
,
that
you
are
returning
to
England
,
you
will
have
*NL*
little
chance
of
meeting
with
him
.
But
the
consideration
of
these
*NL*
points
,
and
the
well-balancing
of
what
you
may
esteem
your
duties
,
I
*NL*
leave
to
you
;
my
judgment
and
ideas
are
already
disturbed
by
the
near
*NL*
approach
of
death
.
I
dare
not
ask
you
to
do
what
I
think
right
,
for
I
*NL*
may
still
be
misled
by
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
should
live
to
be
an
instrument
of
mischief
disturbs
me
;
in
*NL*
other
respects
this
hour
,
when
I
momentarily
expect
my
release
,
is
the
*NL*
only
happy
one
which
I
have
enjoyed
for
several
years
.
The
forms
of
the
*NL*
beloved
dead
flit
before
me
,
and
I
hasten
to
their
arms
.
Farewell
,
*NL*
Walton
!
Seek
happiness
in
tranquillity
,
and
avoid
ambition
,
even
if
it
*NL*
be
only
the
apparently
innocent
one
of
distinguishing
yourself
in
*NL*
science
and
discoveries
.
Yet
why
do
I
say
this
?
I
have
myself
been
*NL*
blasted
in
these
hopes
,
yet
another
may
succeed
.

*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
became
fainter
as
he
spoke
;
and
at
length
,
exhausted
by
his
*NL*
effort
,
he
sunk
into
silence
.
About
half
an
hour
afterwards
he
attempted
*NL*
again
to
speak
,
but
was
unable
;
he
pressed
my
hand
feebly
,
and
his
eyes
*NL*
closed
for
ever
,
while
the
irradiation
of
a
gentle
smile
passed
away
*NL*
from
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
,
what
comment
can
I
make
on
the
untimely
extinction
of
this
*NL*
glorious
spirit
?
What
can
I
say
,
that
will
enable
you
to
understand
the
*NL*
depth
of
my
sorrow
?
All
that
I
should
express
would
be
inadequate
and
*NL*
feeble
.
My
tears
flow
;
my
mind
is
overshadowed
by
a
cloud
of
*NL*
disappointment
.
But
I
journey
towards
England
,
and
I
may
there
find
*NL*
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
interrupted
.
What
do
these
sounds
portend
?
It
is
midnight
;
the
*NL*
breeze
blows
fairly
,
and
the
watch
on
deck
scarcely
stir
.
Again
;
there
*NL*
is
a
sound
as
of
a
human
voice
,
but
hoarser
;
it
comes
from
the
cabin
*NL*
where
the
remains
of
Frankenstein
still
lie
.
I
must
arise
,
and
examine
.
*NL*
Good
night
,
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
God
!
what
a
scene
has
just
taken
place
!
I
am
yet
dizzy
with
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
it
.
I
hardly
know
whether
I
shall
have
the
power
to
*NL*
detail
it
;
yet
the
tale
which
I
have
recorded
would
be
incomplete
*NL*
without
this
final
and
wonderful
catastrophe
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
entered
the
cabin
,
where
lay
the
remains
of
my
ill-fated
and
admirable
*NL*
friend
.
Over
him
hung
a
form
which
I
can
not
find
words
to
describe
;
*NL*
gigantic
in
stature
,
yet
uncouth
and
distorted
in
its
proportions
.
As
he
*NL*
hung
over
the
coffin
,
his
face
was
concealed
by
long
locks
of
ragged
*NL*
hair
;
but
one
vast
hand
was
extended
,
in
colour
and
apparent
texture
*NL*
like
that
of
a
mummy
.
When
he
heard
the
sound
of
my
approach
,
he
ceased
*NL*
to
utter
exclamations
of
grief
and
horror
,
and
sprung
towards
the
*NL*
window
.
Never
did
I
behold
a
vision
so
horrible
as
his
face
,
of
such
*NL*
loathsome
,
yet
appalling
hideousness
.
I
shut
my
eyes
involuntarily
,
and
*NL*
endeavoured
to
recollect
what
were
my
duties
with
regard
to
this
*NL*
destroyer
.
I
called
on
him
to
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
looking
on
me
with
wonder
;
and
,
again
turning
towards
the
*NL*
lifeless
form
of
his
creator
,
he
seemed
to
forget
my
presence
,
and
every
*NL*
feature
and
gesture
seemed
instigated
by
the
wildest
rage
of
some
*NL*
uncontrollable
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
also
my
victim
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
in
his
murder
my
crimes
are
*NL*
consummated
;
the
miserable
series
of
my
being
is
wound
to
its
close
!
Oh
,
*NL*
Frankenstein
!
generous
and
self-devoted
being
!
what
does
it
avail
that
I
*NL*
now
ask
thee
to
pardon
me
?
I
,
who
irretrievably
destroyed
thee
by
*NL*
destroying
all
thou
lovedst
.
Alas
!
he
is
cold
;
he
may
not
answer
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
seemed
suffocated
;
and
my
first
impulses
,
which
had
suggested
*NL*
to
me
the
duty
of
obeying
the
dying
request
of
my
friend
,
in
destroying
*NL*
his
enemy
,
were
now
suspended
by
a
mixture
of
curiosity
and
compassion
.
*NL*
I
approached
this
tremendous
being
;
I
dared
not
again
raise
my
looks
*NL*
upon
his
face
,
there
was
something
so
scaring
and
unearthly
in
his
*NL*
ugliness
.
I
attempted
to
speak
,
but
the
words
died
away
on
my
lips
.
The
*NL*
monster
continued
to
utter
wild
and
incoherent
self-reproaches
.
At
*NL*
length
I
gathered
resolution
to
address
him
,
in
a
pause
of
the
tempest
*NL*
of
his
passion
:
``
Your
repentance
,
''
I
said
,
``
is
now
superfluous
.
If
you
*NL*
had
listened
to
the
voice
of
conscience
,
and
heeded
the
stings
of
*NL*
remorse
,
before
you
had
urged
your
diabolical
vengeance
to
this
*NL*
extremity
,
Frankenstein
would
yet
have
lived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
dream
?
''
said
the
daemon
;
``
do
you
think
that
I
was
then
dead
*NL*
to
agony
and
remorse
?
--
He
,
''
he
continued
,
pointing
to
the
corpse
,
``
he
*NL*
suffered
not
more
in
the
consummation
of
the
deed
;
--
oh
!
not
the
*NL*
ten-thousandth
portion
of
the
anguish
that
was
mine
during
the
lingering
*NL*
detail
of
its
execution
.
A
frightful
selfishness
hurried
me
on
,
while
*NL*
my
heart
was
poisoned
with
remorse
.
Think
ye
that
the
groans
of
Clerval
*NL*
were
music
to
my
ears
?
My
heart
was
fashioned
to
be
susceptible
of
love
*NL*
and
sympathy
;
and
,
when
wrenched
by
misery
to
vice
and
hatred
,
it
did
*NL*
not
endure
the
violence
of
the
change
without
torture
such
as
you
can
not
*NL*
even
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
the
murder
of
Clerval
,
I
returned
to
Switzerland
,
heart-broken
*NL*
and
overcome
.
I
pitied
Frankenstein
;
my
pity
amounted
to
horror
:
I
*NL*
abhorred
myself
.
But
when
I
discovered
that
he
,
the
author
at
once
of
my
*NL*
existence
and
of
its
unspeakable
torments
,
dared
to
hope
for
happiness
;
*NL*
that
while
he
accumulated
wretchedness
and
despair
upon
me
,
he
sought
*NL*
his
own
enjoyment
in
feelings
and
passions
from
the
indulgence
of
which
*NL*
I
was
for
ever
barred
,
then
impotent
envy
and
bitter
indignation
filled
*NL*
me
with
an
insatiable
thirst
for
vengeance
.
I
recollected
my
threat
,
and
*NL*
resolved
that
it
should
be
accomplished
.
I
knew
that
I
was
preparing
for
*NL*
myself
a
deadly
torture
;
but
I
was
the
slave
,
not
the
master
of
an
*NL*
impulse
,
which
I
detested
,
yet
could
not
disobey
.
Yet
when
she
*NL*
died
!
--
nay
,
then
I
was
not
miserable
.
I
had
cast
off
all
feeling
,
*NL*
subdued
all
anguish
to
riot
in
the
excess
of
my
despair
.
Evil
*NL*
thenceforth
became
my
good
.
Urged
thus
far
,
I
had
no
choice
but
to
adapt
*NL*
my
nature
to
an
element
which
I
had
willingly
chosen
.
The
completion
of
*NL*
my
demoniacal
design
became
an
insatiable
passion
.
And
now
it
is
ended
;
*NL*
there
is
my
last
victim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
at
first
touched
by
the
expressions
of
his
misery
;
yet
when
I
*NL*
called
to
mind
what
Frankenstein
had
said
of
his
powers
of
eloquence
and
*NL*
persuasion
,
and
when
I
again
cast
my
eyes
on
the
lifeless
form
of
my
*NL*
friend
,
indignation
was
re-kindled
within
me
.
``
Wretch
!
''
I
said
,
``
it
is
*NL*
well
that
you
come
here
to
whine
over
the
desolation
that
you
have
made
.
*NL*
You
throw
a
torch
into
a
pile
of
buildings
,
and
when
they
are
consumed
*NL*
you
sit
among
the
ruins
,
and
lament
the
fall
.
Hypocritical
fiend
!
if
he
*NL*
whom
you
mourn
still
lived
,
still
would
he
be
the
object
,
again
would
he
*NL*
become
the
prey
of
your
accursed
vengeance
.
It
is
not
pity
that
you
*NL*
feel
;
you
lament
only
because
the
victim
of
your
malignity
is
withdrawn
*NL*
from
your
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
not
thus
--
not
thus
,
''
interrupted
the
being
;
``
yet
such
must
be
*NL*
the
impression
conveyed
to
you
by
what
appears
to
be
the
purport
of
my
*NL*
actions
.
Yet
I
seek
not
a
fellow-feeling
in
my
misery
.
No
sympathy
may
I
*NL*
ever
find
.
When
I
first
sought
it
,
it
was
the
love
of
virtue
,
the
*NL*
feelings
of
happiness
and
affection
with
which
my
whole
being
*NL*
overflowed
,
that
I
wished
to
be
participated
.
But
now
,
that
virtue
has
*NL*
become
to
me
a
shadow
,
and
that
happiness
and
affection
are
turned
into
*NL*
bitter
and
loathing
despair
,
in
what
should
I
seek
for
sympathy
?
I
am
*NL*
content
to
suffer
alone
,
while
my
sufferings
shall
endure
:
when
I
die
,
I
*NL*
am
well
satisfied
that
abhorrence
and
opprobrium
should
load
my
memory
.
*NL*
Once
my
fancy
was
soothed
with
dreams
of
virtue
,
of
fame
,
and
of
*NL*
enjoyment
.
Once
I
falsely
hoped
to
meet
with
beings
,
who
,
pardoning
my
*NL*
outward
form
,
would
love
me
for
the
excellent
qualities
which
I
was
*NL*
capable
of
bringing
forth
.
I
was
nourished
with
high
thoughts
of
honour
*NL*
and
devotion
.
But
now
vice
has
degraded
me
beneath
the
meanest
animal
.
*NL*
No
crime
,
no
mischief
,
no
malignity
,
no
misery
,
can
be
found
comparable
*NL*
to
mine
.
When
I
call
over
the
frightful
catalogue
of
my
deeds
,
I
can
not
*NL*
believe
that
I
am
he
whose
thoughts
were
once
filled
with
sublime
and
*NL*
transcendant
visions
of
the
beauty
and
the
majesty
of
goodness
.
But
it
*NL*
is
even
so
;
the
fallen
angel
becomes
a
malignant
devil
.
Yet
even
that
*NL*
enemy
of
God
and
man
had
friends
and
associates
in
his
desolation
;
I
am
*NL*
quite
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
who
call
Frankenstein
your
friend
,
seem
to
have
a
knowledge
of
my
*NL*
crimes
and
his
misfortunes
.
But
,
in
the
detail
which
he
gave
you
of
*NL*
them
,
he
could
not
sum
up
the
hours
and
months
of
misery
which
I
*NL*
endured
,
wasting
in
impotent
passions
.
For
whilst
I
destroyed
his
hopes
,
*NL*
I
did
not
satisfy
my
own
desires
.
They
were
for
ever
ardent
and
craving
;
*NL*
still
I
desired
love
and
fellowship
,
and
I
was
still
spurned
.
Was
there
*NL*
no
injustice
in
this
?
Am
I
to
be
thought
the
only
criminal
,
when
all
*NL*
human
kind
sinned
against
me
?
Why
do
you
not
hate
Felix
,
who
drove
his
*NL*
friend
from
his
door
with
contumely
?
Why
do
you
not
execrate
the
rustic
*NL*
who
sought
to
destroy
the
saviour
of
his
child
?
Nay
,
these
are
virtuous
*NL*
and
immaculate
beings
!
I
,
the
miserable
and
the
abandoned
,
am
an
*NL*
abortion
,
to
be
spurned
at
,
and
kicked
,
and
trampled
on
.
Even
now
my
*NL*
blood
boils
at
the
recollection
of
this
injustice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
true
that
I
am
a
wretch
.
I
have
murdered
the
lovely
and
the
*NL*
helpless
;
I
have
strangled
the
innocent
as
they
slept
,
and
grasped
to
*NL*
death
his
throat
who
never
injured
me
or
any
other
living
thing
.
I
have
*NL*
devoted
my
creator
,
the
select
specimen
of
all
that
is
worthy
of
love
*NL*
and
admiration
among
men
,
to
misery
;
I
have
pursued
him
even
to
that
*NL*
irremediable
ruin
.
There
he
lies
,
white
and
cold
in
death
.
You
hate
me
;
*NL*
but
your
abhorrence
can
not
equal
that
with
which
I
regard
myself
.
I
look
*NL*
on
the
hands
which
executed
the
deed
;
I
think
on
the
heart
in
which
the
*NL*
imagination
of
it
was
conceived
,
and
long
for
the
moment
when
they
will
*NL*
meet
my
eyes
,
when
it
will
haunt
my
thoughts
,
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fear
not
that
I
shall
be
the
instrument
of
future
mischief

My
work
is
*NL*
nearly
complete
.
Neither
your
's
nor
any
man
's
death
is
needed
to
*NL*
consummate
the
series
of
my
being
,
and
accomplish
that
which
must
be
*NL*
done
;
but
it
requires
my
own
.
Do
not
think
that
I
shall
be
slow
to
*NL*
perform
this
sacrifice
.
I
shall
quit
your
vessel
on
the
ice-raft
which
*NL*
brought
me
hither
,
and
shall
seek
the
most
northern
extremity
of
the
*NL*
globe
;
I
shall
collect
my
funeral
pile
,
and
consume
to
ashes
this
*NL*
miserable
frame
,
that
its
remains
may
afford
no
light
to
any
curious
and
*NL*
unhallowed
wretch
,
who
would
create
such
another
as
I
have
been
.
I
shall
*NL*
die

I
shall
no
longer
feel
the
agonies
which
now
consume
me
,
or
be
the
*NL*
prey
of
feelings
unsatisfied
,
yet
unquenched

He
is
dead
who
called
me
*NL*
into
being
;
and
when
I
shall
be
no
more
,
the
very
remembrance
of
us
both
*NL*
will
speedily
vanish
.
I
shall
no
longer
see
the
sun
or
stars
,
or
feel
*NL*
the
winds
play
on
my
cheeks
.
Light
,
feeling
,
and
sense
,
will
pass
away
;
*NL*
and
in
this
condition
must
I
find
my
happiness
.
Some
years
ago
,
when
the
*NL*
images
which
this
world
affords
first
opened
upon
me
,
when
I
felt
the
*NL*
cheering
warmth
of
summer
,
and
heard
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
the
*NL*
chirping
of
the
birds
,
and
these
were
all
to
me
,
I
should
have
wept
to
*NL*
die
;
now
it
is
my
only
consolation
.
Polluted
by
crimes
,
and
torn
by
the
*NL*
bitterest
remorse
,
where
can
I
find
rest
but
in
death
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
!
I
leave
you
,
and
in
you
the
last
of
human
kind
whom
these
*NL*
eyes
will
ever
behold
.
Farewell
,
Frankenstein
!
If
thou
wert
yet
alive
,
*NL*
and
yet
cherished
a
desire
of
revenge
against
me
,
it
would
be
better
*NL*
satiated
in
my
life
than
in
my
destruction
.
But
it
was
not
so
;
thou
*NL*
didst
seek
my
extinction
,
that
I
might
not
cause
greater
wretchedness
;
*NL*
and
if
yet
,
in
some
mode
unknown
to
me
,
thou
hast
not
yet
ceased
to
*NL*
think
and
feel

thou
desirest
not
my
life
for
my
own
misery

Blasted
as
*NL*
thou
wert

my
agony
was
still
superior
to
thine

for
the
bitter
sting

*NL*
remorse
may
not
cease

rankle
in
my
wounds

death
shall
close

them

sad

``
I

Soon
these
burning
miseries

I
shall
ascend
my
funeral

triumphantly

exult
in
the
*NL*
agony
of
the
torturing
flames

The
light
of
that
conflagration

fade
*NL*
away
;
my
ashes
will
be
swept
into
the

by
the
winds

sleep
in
peace
