INTRODUCTORY
NOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BENJAMIN
FRANKLIN
was
born
in
Milk
Street
,
Boston
,
on
January
6
,
1706
.
*NL*
His
father
,
Josiah
Franklin
,
was
a
tallow
chandler
who
married
twice
,
*NL*
and
of
his
seventeen
children
Benjamin
was
the
youngest
son
.
His
*NL*
schooling
ended
at
ten
,
and
at
twelve
he
was
bound
apprentice
to
his
*NL*
brother
James
,
a
printer
,
who
published
the
``
New
England
Courant
.
''
To
*NL*
this
journal
he
became
a
contributor
,
and
later
was
for
a
time
its
*NL*
nominal
editor
.
But
the
brothers
quarreled
,
and
Benjamin
ran
away
,
*NL*
going
first
to
New
York
,
and
thence
to
Philadelphia
,
where
he
arrived
*NL*
in
October
,
1723
.
He
soon
obtained
work
as
a
printer
,
but
after
a
few
*NL*
months
he
was
induced
by
Governor
Keith
to
go
to
London
,
where
,
finding
*NL*
Keith
's
promises
empty
,
he
again
worked
as
a
compositor
till
he
was
*NL*
brought
back
to
Philadelphia
by
a
merchant
named
Denman
,
who
gave
him
*NL*
a
position
in
his
business
.
On
Denman
's
death
he
returned
to
his
former
*NL*
trade
,
and
shortly
set
up
a
printing
house
of
his
own
from
which
he
*NL*
published
``
The
Pennsylvania
Gazette
,
''
to
which
he
contributed
many
*NL*
essays
,
and
which
he
made
a
medium
for
agitating
a
variety
of
local
*NL*
reforms
.
In
1732
he
began
to
issue
his
famous
``
Poor
Richard
's
Almanac
''
*NL*
for
the
enrichment
of
which
he
borrowed
or
composed
those
pithy
*NL*
utterances
of
worldly
wisdom
which
are
the
basis
of
a
large
part
of
his
*NL*
popular
reputation
.
In
1758
,
the
year
in
which
he
ceases
writing
for
*NL*
the
Almanac
,
he
printed
in
it
``
Father
Abraham
's
Sermon
,
''
now
regarded
*NL*
as
the
most
famous
piece
of
literature
produced
in
Colonial
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
Franklin
was
concerning
himself
more
and
more
with
public
*NL*
affairs
.
He
set
forth
a
scheme
for
an
Academy
,
which
was
taken
up
*NL*
later
and
finally
developed
into
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
;
and
he
*NL*
founded
an
``
American
Philosophical
Society
''
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
*NL*
scientific
men
to
communicate
their
discoveries
to
one
another
.
He
*NL*
himself
had
already
begun
his
electrical
researches
,
which
,
with
other
*NL*
scientific
inquiries
,
he
called
on
in
the
intervals
of
money-making
and
*NL*
politics
to
the
end
of
his
life
.
In
1748
he
sold
his
business
in
order
*NL*
to
get
leisure
for
study
,
having
now
acquired
comparative
wealth
;
and
*NL*
in
a
few
years
he
had
made
discoveries
that
gave
him
a
reputation
with
*NL*
the
learned
throughout
Europe
.
In
politics
he
proved
very
able
both
as
*NL*
an
administrator
and
as
a
controversialist
;
but
his
record
as
an
*NL*
office-holder
is
stained
by
the
use
he
made
of
his
position
to
advance
*NL*
his
relatives
.
His
most
notable
service
in
home
politics
was
his
*NL*
reform
of
the
postal
system
;
but
his
fame
as
a
statesman
rests
chiefly
*NL*
on
his
services
in
connection
with
the
relations
of
the
Colonies
with
*NL*
Great
Britain
,
and
later
with
France
.
In
1757
he
was
sent
to
England
*NL*
to
protest
against
the
influence
of
the
Penns
in
the
government
of
the
*NL*
colony
,
and
for
five
years
he
remained
there
,
striving
to
enlighten
the
*NL*
people
and
the
ministry
of
England
as
to
Colonial
conditions
.
On
his
*NL*
return
to
America
he
played
an
honorable
part
in
the
Paxton
affair
,
*NL*
through
which
he
lost
his
seat
in
the
Assembly
;
but
in
1764
he
was
*NL*
again
despatched
to
England
as
agent
for
the
colony
,
this
time
to
*NL*
petition
the
King
to
resume
the
government
from
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
proprietors
.
In
London
he
actively
opposed
the
proposed
Stamp
Act
,
but
*NL*
lost
the
credit
for
this
and
much
of
his
popularity
through
his
*NL*
securing
for
a
friend
the
office
of
stamp
agent
in
America
.
Even
his
*NL*
effective
work
in
helping
to
obtain
the
repeal
of
the
act
left
him
*NL*
still
a
suspect
;
but
he
continued
his
efforts
to
present
the
case
for
*NL*
the
Colonies
as
the
troubles
thickened
toward
the
crisis
of
the
*NL*
Revolution
.
In
1767
he
crossed
to
France
,
where
he
was
received
with
*NL*
honor
;
but
before
his
return
home
in
1775
he
lost
his
position
as
*NL*
postmaster
through
his
share
in
divulging
to
Massachusetts
the
famous
*NL*
letter
of
Hutchinson
and
Oliver
.
On
his
arrival
in
Philadelphia
he
was
*NL*
chosen
a
member
of
the
Continental
Congress
and
in
1777
he
was
*NL*
despatched
to
France
as
commissioner
for
the
United
States
.
Here
he
*NL*
remained
till
1785
,
the
favorite
of
French
society
;
and
with
such
*NL*
success
did
he
conduct
the
affairs
of
his
country
that
when
he
finally
*NL*
returned
he
received
a
place
only
second
to
that
of
Washington
as
the
*NL*
champion
of
American
independence
.
He
died
on
April
17
,
1790
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
five
chapters
of
the
Autobiography
were
composed
in
England
*NL*
in
1771
,
continued
in
1784-5
,
and
again
in
1788
,
at
which
date
he
*NL*
brought
it
down
to
1757
.
After
a
most
extraordinary
series
of
*NL*
adventures
,
the
original
form
of
the
manuscript
was
finally
printed
by
*NL*
Mr.
John
Bigelow
,
and
is
here
reproduced
in
recognition
of
its
value
as
*NL*
a
picture
of
one
of
the
most
notable
personalities
of
Colonial
times
,
*NL*
and
of
its
acknowledged
rank
as
one
of
the
great
autobiographies
of
the
*NL*
world

*NL*
DEAR
SON
:
I
have
ever
had
pleasure
in
obtaining
any
little
anecdotes
*NL*
of
my
ancestors
.
You
may
remember
the
inquiries
I
made
among
the
*NL*
remains
of
my
relations
when
you
were
with
me
in
England
,
and
the
*NL*
journey
I
undertook
for
that
purpose
.
Imagining
it
may
be
equally
*NL*
agreeable
to
-LSB-
1
-RSB-
you
to
know
the
circumstances
of
my
life
,
many
of
which
*NL*
you
are
yet
unacquainted
with
,
and
expecting
the
enjoyment
of
a
week
's
*NL*
uninterrupted
leisure
in
my
present
country
retirement
,
I
sit
down
to
*NL*
write
them
for
you
.
To
which
I
have
besides
some
other
inducements
.
*NL*
Having
emerged
from
the
poverty
and
obscurity
in
which
I
was
born
and
*NL*
bred
,
to
a
state
of
affluence
and
some
degree
of
reputation
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
having
gone
so
far
through
life
with
a
considerable
share
of
*NL*
felicity
,
the
conducing
means
I
made
use
of
,
which
with
the
blessing
of
*NL*
God
so
well
succeeded
,
my
posterity
may
like
to
know
,
as
they
may
find
*NL*
some
of
them
suitable
to
their
own
situations
,
and
therefore
fit
to
be
*NL*
imitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
1
-RSB-
After
the
words
``
agreeable
to
''
the
words
``
some
of
''
were
*NL*
interlined
and
afterward
effaced
.
--
B
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
felicity
,
when
I
reflected
on
it
,
has
induced
me
sometimes
to
say
,
*NL*
that
were
it
offered
to
my
choice
,
I
should
have
no
objection
to
a
*NL*
repetition
of
the
same
life
from
its
beginning
,
only
asking
the
*NL*
advantages
authors
have
in
a
second
edition
to
correct
some
faults
of
*NL*
the
first
.
So
I
might
,
besides
correcting
the
faults
,
change
some
*NL*
sinister
accidents
and
events
of
it
for
others
more
favorable
.
But
*NL*
though
this
were
denied
,
I
should
still
accept
the
offer
.
Since
such
a
*NL*
repetition
is
not
to
be
expected
,
the
next
thing
most
like
living
one
's
*NL*
life
over
again
seems
to
be
a
recollection
of
that
life
,
and
to
make
*NL*
that
recollection
as
durable
as
possible
by
putting
it
down
in
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hereby
,
too
,
I
shall
indulge
the
inclination
so
natural
in
old
men
,
to
*NL*
be
talking
of
themselves
and
their
own
past
actions
;
and
I
shall
*NL*
indulge
it
without
being
tiresome
to
others
,
who
,
through
respect
to
*NL*
age
,
might
conceive
themselves
obliged
to
give
me
a
hearing
,
since
this
*NL*
may
be
read
or
not
as
any
one
pleases
.
And
,
lastly
-LRB-
I
may
as
well
*NL*
confess
it
,
since
my
denial
of
it
will
be
believed
by
nobody
-RRB-
,
perhaps
*NL*
I
shall
a
good
deal
gratify
my
own
vanity
.
Indeed
,
I
scarce
ever
heard
*NL*
or
saw
the
introductory
words
,
``
Without
vanity
I
may
say
,
''
&
c.
,
but
*NL*
some
vain
thing
immediately
followed
.
Most
people
dislike
vanity
in
*NL*
others
,
whatever
share
they
have
of
it
themselves
;
but
I
give
it
fair
*NL*
quarter
wherever
I
meet
with
it
,
being
persuaded
that
it
is
often
*NL*
productive
of
good
to
the
possessor
,
and
to
others
that
are
within
his
*NL*
sphere
of
action
;
and
therefore
,
in
many
cases
,
it
would
not
be
*NL*
altogether
absurd
if
a
man
were
to
thank
God
for
his
vanity
among
the
*NL*
other
comforts
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
speak
of
thanking
God
,
I
desire
with
all
humility
to
*NL*
acknowledge
that
I
owe
the
mentioned
happiness
of
my
past
life
to
His
*NL*
kind
providence
,
which
lead
me
to
the
means
I
used
and
gave
them
*NL*
success
.
My
belief
of
this
induces
me
to
hope
,
though
I
must
not
*NL*
presume
,
that
the
same
goodness
will
still
be
exercised
toward
me
,
in
*NL*
continuing
that
happiness
,
or
enabling
me
to
bear
a
fatal
reverse
,
*NL*
which
I
may
experience
as
others
have
done
:
the
complexion
of
my
*NL*
future
fortune
being
known
to
Him
only
in
whose
power
it
is
to
bless
to
*NL*
us
even
our
afflictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
notes
one
of
my
uncles
-LRB-
who
had
the
same
kind
of
curiosity
in
*NL*
collecting
family
anecdotes
-RRB-
once
put
into
my
hands
,
furnished
me
with
*NL*
several
particulars
relating
to
our
ancestors
.
From
these
notes
I
*NL*
learned
that
the
family
had
lived
in
the
same
village
,
Ecton
,
in
*NL*
Northamptonshire
,
for
three
hundred
years
,
and
how
much
longer
he
knew
*NL*
not
-LRB-
perhaps
from
the
time
when
the
name
of
Franklin
,
that
before
was
*NL*
the
name
of
an
order
of
people
,
was
assumed
by
them
as
a
surname
when
*NL*
others
took
surnames
all
over
the
kingdom
-RRB-
,
on
a
freehold
of
about
*NL*
thirty
acres
,
aided
by
the
smith
's
business
,
which
had
continued
in
the
*NL*
family
till
his
time
,
the
eldest
son
being
always
bred
to
that
*NL*
business
;
a
custom
which
he
and
my
father
followed
as
to
their
eldest
*NL*
sons
.
When
I
searched
the
registers
at
Ecton
,
I
found
an
account
of
*NL*
their
births
,
marriages
and
burials
from
the
year
1555
only
,
there
*NL*
being
no
registers
kept
in
that
parish
at
any
time
preceding
.
By
that
*NL*
register
I
perceived
that
I
was
the
youngest
son
of
the
youngest
son
*NL*
for
five
generations
back
.
My
grandfather
Thomas
,
who
was
born
in
*NL*
1598
,
lived
at
Ecton
till
he
grew
too
old
to
follow
business
longer
,
*NL*
when
he
went
to
live
with
his
son
John
,
a
dyer
at
Banbury
,
in
*NL*
Oxfordshire
,
with
whom
my
father
served
an
apprenticeship
.
There
my
*NL*
grandfather
died
and
lies
buried
.
We
saw
his
gravestone
in
1758
.
His
*NL*
eldest
son
Thomas
lived
in
the
house
at
Ecton
,
and
left
it
with
the
*NL*
land
to
his
only
child
,
a
daughter
,
who
,
with
her
husband
,
one
Fisher
,
*NL*
of
Wellingborough
,
sold
it
to
Mr.
Isted
,
now
lord
of
the
manor
there
.
*NL*
My
grandfather
had
four
sons
that
grew
up
,
viz.
:
Thomas
,
John
,
Benjamin
*NL*
and
Josiah
.
I
will
give
you
what
account
I
can
of
them
,
at
this
*NL*
distance
from
my
papers
,
and
if
these
are
not
lost
in
my
absence
,
you
*NL*
will
among
them
find
many
more
particulars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomas
was
bred
a
smith
under
his
father
;
but
,
being
ingenious
,
and
*NL*
encouraged
in
learning
-LRB-
as
all
my
brothers
were
-RRB-
by
an
Esquire
Palmer
,
*NL*
then
the
principal
gentleman
in
that
parish
,
he
qualified
himself
for
*NL*
the
business
of
scrivener
;
became
a
considerable
man
in
the
county
;
was
*NL*
a
chief
mover
of
all
public-spirited
undertakings
for
the
county
or
*NL*
town
of
Northampton
,
and
his
own
village
,
of
which
many
instances
were
*NL*
related
of
him
;
and
much
taken
notice
of
and
patronized
by
the
then
*NL*
Lord
Halifax
.
He
died
in
1702
,
January
6
,
old
style
,
just
four
years
*NL*
to
a
day
before
I
was
born
.
The
account
we
received
of
his
life
and
*NL*
character
from
some
old
people
at
Ecton
,
I
remember
,
struck
you
as
*NL*
something
extraordinary
,
from
its
similarity
to
what
you
knew
of
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
he
died
on
the
same
day
,
''
you
said
,
``
one
might
have
supposed
a
*NL*
transmigration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
John
was
bred
a
dyer
,
I
believe
of
woolens
.
Benjamin
was
bred
a
silk
*NL*
dyer
,
serving
an
apprenticeship
at
London
.
He
was
an
ingenious
man
.
I
*NL*
remember
him
well
,
for
when
I
was
a
boy
he
came
over
to
my
father
in
*NL*
Boston
,
and
lived
in
the
house
with
us
some
years
.
He
lived
to
a
great
*NL*
age
.
His
grandson
,
Samuel
Franklin
,
now
lives
in
Boston
.
He
left
*NL*
behind
him
two
quarto
volumes
,
MS.
,
of
his
own
poetry
,
consisting
of
*NL*
little
occasional
pieces
addressed
to
his
friends
and
relations
,
of
*NL*
which
the
following
,
sent
to
me
,
is
a
specimen
.

He
had
formed
a
*NL*
short-hand
of
his
own
,
which
he
taught
me
,
but
,
never
practising
it
,
I
*NL*
have
now
forgot
it
.
I
was
named
after
this
uncle
,
there
being
a
*NL*
particular
affection
between
him
and
my
father
.
He
was
very
pious
,
a
*NL*
great
attender
of
sermons
of
the
best
preachers
,
which
he
took
down
in
*NL*
his
short-hand
,
and
had
with
him
many
volumes
of
them
.
He
was
also
*NL*
much
of
a
politician
;
too
much
,
perhaps
,
for
his
station
.
There
fell
*NL*
lately
into
my
hands
,
in
London
,
a
collection
he
had
made
of
all
the
*NL*
principal
pamphlets
,
relating
to
public
affairs
,
from
1641
to
1717
;
*NL*
many
of
the
volumes
are
wanting
as
appears
by
the
numbering
,
but
there
*NL*
still
remain
eight
volumes
in
folio
,
and
twenty-four
in
quarto
and
in
*NL*
octavo
.
A
dealer
in
old
books
met
with
them
,
and
knowing
me
by
my
*NL*
sometimes
buying
of
him
,
he
brought
them
to
me
.
It
seems
my
uncle
must
*NL*
have
left
them
here
,
when
he
went
to
America
,
which
was
about
fifty
*NL*
years
since
.
There
are
many
of
his
notes
in
the
margins
.

Here
follow
in
the
margin
the
words
,
in
brackets
,
``
here
*NL*
insert
it
,
''
but
the
poetry
is
not
given
.
Mr.
Sparks
*NL*
informs
us
-LRB-
Life
of
Franklin
,
p.
6
-RRB-
that
these
volumes
*NL*
had
been
preserved
,
and
were
in
possession
of
Mrs.
Emmons
,
*NL*
of
Boston
,
great-granddaughter
of
their
author
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
obscure
family
of
ours
was
early
in
the
Reformation
,
and
continued
*NL*
Protestants
through
the
reign
of
Queen
Mary
,
when
they
were
sometimes
*NL*
in
danger
of
trouble
on
account
of
their
zeal
against
popery
.
They
had
*NL*
got
an
English
Bible
,
and
to
conceal
and
secure
it
,
it
was
fastened
*NL*
open
with
tapes
under
and
within
the
cover
of
a
joint-stool
.
When
my
*NL*
great-great-grandfather
read
it
to
his
family
,
he
turned
up
the
*NL*
joint-stool
upon
his
knees
,
turning
over
the
leaves
then
under
the
*NL*
tapes
.
One
of
the
children
stood
at
the
door
to
give
notice
if
he
saw
*NL*
the
apparitor
coming
,
who
was
an
officer
of
the
spiritual
court
.
In
*NL*
that
case
the
stool
was
turned
down
again
upon
its
feet
,
when
the
Bible
*NL*
remained
concealed
under
it
as
before
.
This
anecdote
I
had
from
my
*NL*
uncle
Benjamin
.
The
family
continued
all
of
the
Church
of
England
till
*NL*
about
the
end
of
Charles
the
Second
's
reign
,
when
some
of
the
ministers
*NL*
that
had
been
outed
for
nonconformity
holding
conventicles
in
*NL*
Northamptonshire
,
Benjamin
and
Josiah
adhered
to
them
,
and
so
continued
*NL*
all
their
lives
:
the
rest
of
the
family
remained
with
the
Episcopal
*NL*
Church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Josiah
,
my
father
,
married
young
,
and
carried
his
wife
with
three
*NL*
children
into
New
England
,
about
1682
.
The
conventicles
having
been
*NL*
forbidden
by
law
,
and
frequently
disturbed
,
induced
some
considerable
*NL*
men
of
his
acquaintance
to
remove
to
that
country
,
and
he
was
prevailed
*NL*
with
to
accompany
them
thither
,
where
they
expected
to
enjoy
their
mode
*NL*
of
religion
with
freedom
.
By
the
same
wife
he
had
four
children
more
*NL*
born
there
,
and
by
a
second
wife
ten
more
,
in
all
seventeen
;
of
which
I
*NL*
remember
thirteen
sitting
at
one
time
at
his
table
,
who
all
grew
up
to
*NL*
be
men
and
women
,
and
married
;
I
was
the
youngest
son
,
and
the
youngest
*NL*
child
but
two
,
and
was
born
in
Boston
,
New
England
.
My
mother
,
the
*NL*
second
wife
,
was
Abiah
Folger
,
daughter
of
Peter
Folger
,
one
of
the
*NL*
first
settlers
of
New
England
,
of
whom
honorable
mention
is
made
by
*NL*
Cotton
Mather
in
his
church
history
of
that
country
,
entitled
Magnalia
*NL*
Christi
Americana
,
as
``
a
godly
,
learned
Englishman
,
''
if
I
remember
the
*NL*
words
rightly
.
I
have
heard
that
he
wrote
sundry
small
occasional
*NL*
pieces
,
but
only
one
of
them
was
printed
,
which
I
saw
now
many
years
*NL*
since
.
It
was
written
in
1675
,
in
the
home-spun
verse
of
that
time
and
*NL*
people
,
and
addressed
to
those
then
concerned
in
the
government
there
.
*NL*
It
was
in
favor
of
liberty
of
conscience
,
and
in
behalf
of
the
*NL*
Baptists
,
Quakers
,
and
other
sectaries
that
had
been
under
persecution
,
*NL*
ascribing
the
Indian
wars
,
and
other
distresses
that
had
befallen
the
*NL*
country
,
to
that
persecution
,
as
so
many
judgments
of
God
to
punish
so
*NL*
heinous
an
offense
,
and
exhorting
a
repeal
of
those
uncharitable
laws
.
*NL*
The
whole
appeared
to
me
as
written
with
a
good
deal
of
decent
*NL*
plainness
and
manly
freedom
.
The
six
concluding
lines
I
remember
,
*NL*
though
I
have
forgotten
the
two
first
of
the
stanza
;
but
the
purport
of
*NL*
them
was
,
that
his
censures
proceeded
from
good-will
,
and
,
therefore
,
*NL*
he
would
be
known
to
be
the
author
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
to
be
a
libeller

he

''
*NL*
*NL*
My
elder
brothers
were
all
put
apprentices
to
different
trades
.
I
was
*NL*
put
to
the
grammar-school
at
eight
years
of
age
,
my
father
intending
to
*NL*
devote
me
,
as
the
tithe
of
his
sons
,
to
the
service
of
the
Church
.
My
*NL*
early
readiness
in
learning
to
read
-LRB-
which
must
have
been
very
early
,
*NL*
as
I
do
not
remember
when
I
could
not
read
-RRB-
,
and
the
opinion
of
all
his
*NL*
friends
,
that
I
should
certainly
make
a
good
scholar
,
encouraged
him
in
*NL*
this
purpose
of
his
.
My
uncle
Benjamin
,
too
,
approved
of
it
,
and
*NL*
proposed
to
give
me
all
his
short-hand
volumes
of
sermons
,
I
suppose
as
*NL*
a
stock
to
set
up
with
,
if
I
would
learn
his
character
.
I
continued
,
*NL*
however
,
at
the
grammar-school
not
quite
one
year
,
though
in
that
time
*NL*
I
had
risen
gradually
from
the
middle
of
the
class
of
that
year
to
be
*NL*
the
head
of
it
,
and
farther
was
removed
into
the
next
class
above
it
,
*NL*
in
order
to
go
with
that
into
the
third
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
But
my
*NL*
father
,
in
the
meantime
,
from
a
view
of
the
expense
of
a
college
*NL*
education
,
which
having
so
large
a
family
he
could
not
well
afford
,
and
*NL*
the
mean
living
many
so
educated
were
afterwards
able
to
*NL*
obtain
--
reasons
that
he
gave
to
his
friends
in
my
hearing
--
altered
his
*NL*
first
intention
,
took
me
from
the
grammar-school
,
and
sent
me
to
a
*NL*
school
for
writing
and
arithmetic
,
kept
by
a
then
famous
man
,
Mr.
*NL*
George
Brownell
,
very
successful
in
his
profession
generally
,
and
that
*NL*
by
mild
,
encouraging
methods
.
Under
him
I
acquired
fair
writing
pretty
*NL*
soon
,
but
I
failed
in
the
arithmetic
,
and
made
no
progress
in
it
.
At
*NL*
ten
years
old
I
was
taken
home
to
assist
my
father
in
his
business
,
*NL*
which
was
that
of
a
tallow-chandler
and
sope-boiler
;
a
business
he
was
*NL*
not
bred
to
,
but
had
assumed
on
his
arrival
in
New
England
,
and
on
*NL*
finding
his
dying
trade
would
not
maintain
his
family
,
being
in
little
*NL*
request
.
Accordingly
,
I
was
employed
in
cutting
wick
for
the
candles
,
*NL*
filling
the
dipping
mold
and
the
molds
for
cast
candles
,
attending
the
*NL*
shop
,
going
of
errands
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
disliked
the
trade
,
and
had
a
strong
inclination
for
the
sea
,
but
my
*NL*
father
declared
against
it
;
however
,
living
near
the
water
,
I
was
much
*NL*
in
and
about
it
,
learnt
early
to
swim
well
,
and
to
manage
boats
;
and
*NL*
when
in
a
boat
or
canoe
with
other
boys
,
I
was
commonly
allowed
to
*NL*
govern
,
especially
in
any
case
of
difficulty
;
and
upon
other
occasions
*NL*
I
was
generally
a
leader
among
the
boys
,
and
sometimes
led
them
into
*NL*
scrapes
,
of
which
I
will
mention
one
instance
,
as
it
shows
an
early
*NL*
projecting
public
spirit
,
tho
'
not
then
justly
conducted
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
salt-marsh
that
bounded
part
of
the
mill-pond
,
on
the
edge
*NL*
of
which
,
at
high
water
,
we
used
to
stand
to
fish
for
minnows
.
By
much
*NL*
trampling
,
we
had
made
it
a
mere
quagmire
.
My
proposal
was
to
build
a
*NL*
wharff
there
fit
for
us
to
stand
upon
,
and
I
showed
my
comrades
a
large
*NL*
heap
of
stones
,
which
were
intended
for
a
new
house
near
the
marsh
,
and
*NL*
which
would
very
well
suit
our
purpose
.
Accordingly
,
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
when
the
workmen
were
gone
,
I
assembled
a
number
of
my
play-fellows
,
*NL*
and
working
with
them
diligently
like
so
many
emmets
,
sometimes
two
or
*NL*
three
to
a
stone
,
we
brought
them
all
away
and
built
our
little
wharff
.
*NL*
The
next
morning
the
workmen
were
surprised
at
missing
the
stones
,
*NL*
which
were
found
in
our
wharff
.
Inquiry
was
made
after
the
removers
;
*NL*
we
were
discovered
and
complained
of
;
several
of
us
were
corrected
by
*NL*
our
fathers
;
and
though
I
pleaded
the
usefulness
of
the
work
,
mine
*NL*
convinced
me
that
nothing
was
useful
which
was
not
honest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
you
may
like
to
know
something
of
his
person
and
character
.
He
*NL*
had
an
excellent
constitution
of
body
,
was
of
middle
stature
,
but
well
*NL*
set
,
and
very
strong
;
he
was
ingenious
,
could
draw
prettily
,
was
*NL*
skilled
a
little
in
music
,
and
had
a
clear
pleasing
voice
,
so
that
when
*NL*
he
played
psalm
tunes
on
his
violin
and
sung
withal
,
as
he
sometimes
*NL*
did
in
an
evening
after
the
business
of
the
day
was
over
,
it
was
*NL*
extremely
agreeable
to
hear
.
He
had
a
mechanical
genius
too
,
and
,
on
*NL*
occasion
,
was
very
handy
in
the
use
of
other
tradesmen
's
tools
;
but
his
*NL*
great
excellence
lay
in
a
sound
understanding
and
solid
judgment
in
*NL*
prudential
matters
,
both
in
private
and
publick
affairs
.
In
the
*NL*
latter
,
indeed
,
he
was
never
employed
,
the
numerous
family
he
had
to
*NL*
educate
and
the
straitness
of
his
circumstances
keeping
him
close
to
*NL*
his
trade
;
but
I
remember
well
his
being
frequently
visited
by
leading
*NL*
people
,
who
consulted
him
for
his
opinion
in
affairs
of
the
town
or
of
*NL*
the
church
he
belonged
to
,
and
showed
a
good
deal
of
respect
for
his
*NL*
judgment
and
advice
:
he
was
also
much
consulted
by
private
persons
*NL*
about
their
affairs
when
any
difficulty
occurred
,
and
frequently
chosen
*NL*
an
arbitrator
between
contending
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
table
he
liked
to
have
,
as
often
as
he
could
,
some
sensible
*NL*
friend
or
neighbor
to
converse
with
,
and
always
took
care
to
start
some
*NL*
ingenious
or
useful
topic
for
discourse
,
which
might
tend
to
improve
*NL*
the
minds
of
his
children
.
By
this
means
he
turned
our
attention
to
*NL*
what
was
good
,
just
,
and
prudent
in
the
conduct
of
life
;
and
little
or
*NL*
no
notice
was
ever
taken
of
what
related
to
the
victuals
on
the
table
,
*NL*
whether
it
was
well
or
ill
dressed
,
in
or
out
of
season
,
of
good
or
bad
*NL*
flavor
,
preferable
or
inferior
to
this
or
that
other
thing
of
the
kind
,
*NL*
so
that
I
was
bro
'
t
up
in
such
a
perfect
inattention
to
those
matters
*NL*
as
to
be
quite
indifferent
what
kind
of
food
was
set
before
me
,
and
so
*NL*
unobservant
of
it
,
that
to
this
day
if
I
am
asked
I
can
scarce
tell
a
*NL*
few
hours
after
dinner
what
I
dined
upon
.
This
has
been
a
convenience
*NL*
to
me
in
travelling
,
where
my
companions
have
been
sometimes
very
*NL*
unhappy
for
want
of
a
suitable
gratification
of
their
more
delicate
,
*NL*
because
better
instructed
,
tastes
and
appetites
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
had
likewise
an
excellent
constitution
:
she
suckled
all
her
*NL*
ten
children
.
I
never
knew
either
my
father
or
mother
to
have
any
*NL*
sickness
but
that
of
which
they
dy
'd
,
he
at
89
,
and
she
at
85
years
of
*NL*
age
.
They
lie
buried
together
at
Boston
,
where
I
some
years
since
*NL*
placed
a
marble
over
their
grave
,
with
this
inscription
:
*NL*
*NL*
JOSIAH
FRANKLIN
,
*NL*
and
*NL*
ABIAH
his
Wife
,
*NL*
lie
here
interred
.
*NL*
They
lived
lovingly
together
in
wedlock
*NL*
fifty-five
years
.
*NL*
Without
an
estate
,
or
any
gainful
employment
,
*NL*
By
constant
labor
and
industry
,
*NL*
with
God
's
blessing
,
*NL*
They
maintained
a
large
family
*NL*
comfortably
,
*NL*
and
brought
up
thirteen
children
*NL*
and
seven
grandchildren
*NL*
reputably
.
*NL*
From
this
instance
,
reader
,
*NL*
Be
encouraged
to
diligence
in
thy
calling
,
*NL*
And
distrust
not
Providence
.
*NL*
He
was
a
pious
and
prudent
man
;
*NL*
She
,

*NL*
*NL*
By
my
rambling
digressions
I
perceive
myself
to
be
grown
old
.
I
us
'd
*NL*
to
write
more
methodically
.
But
one
does
not
dress
for
private
company
*NL*
as
for
a
publick
ball
.
'T
is
perhaps
only
negligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
return
:
I
continued
thus
employed
in
my
father
's
business
for
two
*NL*
years
,
that
is
,
till
I
was
twelve
years
old
;
and
my
brother
John
,
who
*NL*
was
bred
to
that
business
,
having
left
my
father
,
married
,
and
set
up
*NL*
for
himself
at
Rhode
Island
,
there
was
all
appearance
that
I
was
*NL*
destined
to
supply
his
place
,
and
become
a
tallow-chandler
.
But
my
*NL*
dislike
to
the
trade
continuing
,
my
father
was
under
apprehensions
that
*NL*
if
he
did
not
find
one
for
me
more
agreeable
,
I
should
break
away
and
*NL*
get
to
sea
,
as
his
son
Josiah
had
done
,
to
his
great
vexation
.
He
*NL*
therefore
sometimes
took
me
to
walk
with
him
,
and
see
joiners
,
*NL*
bricklayers
,
turners
,
braziers
,
etc.
,
at
their
work
,
that
he
might
*NL*
observe
my
inclination
,
and
endeavor
to
fix
it
on
some
trade
or
other
*NL*
on
land
.
It
has
ever
since
been
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
good
workmen
*NL*
handle
their
tools
;
and
it
has
been
useful
to
me
,
having
learnt
so
much
*NL*
by
it
as
to
be
able
to
do
little
jobs
myself
in
my
house
when
a
workman
*NL*
could
not
readily
be
got
,
and
to
construct
little
machines
for
my
*NL*
experiments
,
while
the
intention
of
making
the
experiment
was
fresh
and
*NL*
warm
in
my
mind
.
My
father
at
last
fixed
upon
the
cutler
's
trade
,
and
*NL*
my
uncle
Benjamin
's
son
Samuel
,
who
was
bred
to
that
business
in
*NL*
London
,
being
about
that
time
established
in
Boston
,
I
was
sent
to
be
*NL*
with
him
some
time
on
liking
.
But
his
expectations
of
a
fee
with
me
*NL*
displeasing
my
father
,
I
was
taken
home
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
child
I
was
fond
of
reading
,
and
all
the
little
money
that
came
*NL*
into
my
hands
was
ever
laid
out
in
books
.
Pleased
with
the
Pilgrim
's
*NL*
Progress
,
my
first
collection
was
of
John
Bunyan
's
works
in
separate
*NL*
little
volumes
.
I
afterward
sold
them
to
enable
me
to
buy
R.
Burton
's
*NL*
Historical
Collections
;
they
were
small
chapmen
's
books
,
and
cheap
,
40
*NL*
or
50
in
all
.
My
father
's
little
library
consisted
chiefly
of
books
in
*NL*
polemic
divinity
,
most
of
which
I
read
,
and
have
since
often
regretted
*NL*
that
,
at
a
time
when
I
had
such
a
thirst
for
knowledge
,
more
proper
*NL*
books
had
not
fallen
in
my
way
since
it
was
now
resolved
I
should
not
*NL*
be
a
clergyman
.
Plutarch
's
Lives
there
was
in
which
I
read
abundantly
,
*NL*
and
I
still
think
that
time
spent
to
great
advantage
.
There
was
also
a
*NL*
book
of
De
Foe
's
,
called
an
Essay
on
Projects
,
and
another
of
Dr.
*NL*
Mather
's
,
called
Essays
to
do
Good
,
which
perhaps
gave
me
a
turn
of
*NL*
thinking
that
had
an
influence
on
some
of
the
principal
future
events
*NL*
of
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
bookish
inclination
at
length
determined
my
father
to
make
me
a
*NL*
printer
,
though
he
had
already
one
son
-LRB-
James
-RRB-
of
that
profession
.
In
*NL*
1717
my
brother
James
returned
from
England
with
a
press
and
letters
to
*NL*
set
up
his
business
in
Boston
.
I
liked
it
much
better
than
that
of
my
*NL*
father
,
but
still
had
a
hankering
for
the
sea
.
To
prevent
the
*NL*
apprehended
effect
of
such
an
inclination
,
my
father
was
impatient
to
*NL*
have
me
bound
to
my
brother
.
I
stood
out
some
time
,
but
at
last
was
*NL*
persuaded
,
and
signed
the
indentures
when
I
was
yet
but
twelve
years
*NL*
old
.
I
was
to
serve
as
an
apprentice
till
I
was
twenty-one
years
of
*NL*
age
,
only
I
was
to
be
allowed
journeyman
's
wages
during
the
last
year
.
*NL*
In
a
little
time
I
made
great
proficiency
in
the
business
,
and
became
a
*NL*
useful
hand
to
my
brother
.
I
now
had
access
to
better
books
.
An
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
apprentices
of
booksellers
enabled
me
sometimes
*NL*
to
borrow
a
small
one
,
which
I
was
careful
to
return
soon
and
clean
.
*NL*
Often
I
sat
up
in
my
room
reading
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
,
when
*NL*
the
book
was
borrowed
in
the
evening
and
to
be
returned
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
lest
it
should
be
missed
or
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
some
time
an
ingenious
tradesman
,
Mr.
Matthew
Adams
,
who
had
*NL*
a
pretty
collection
of
books
,
and
who
frequented
our
printing-house
,
*NL*
took
notice
of
me
,
invited
me
to
his
library
,
and
very
kindly
lent
me
*NL*
such
books
as
I
chose
to
read
.
I
now
took
a
fancy
to
poetry
,
and
made
*NL*
some
little
pieces
;
my
brother
,
thinking
it
might
turn
to
account
,
*NL*
encouraged
me
,
and
put
me
on
composing
occasional
ballads
.
One
was
*NL*
called
The
Lighthouse
Tragedy
,
and
contained
an
account
of
the
drowning
*NL*
of
Captain
Worthilake
,
with
his
two
daughters
:
the
other
was
a
sailor
's
*NL*
song
,
on
the
taking
of
Teach
-LRB-
or
Blackbeard
-RRB-
the
pirate
.
They
were
*NL*
wretched
stuff
,
in
the
Grub-street-ballad
style
;
and
when
they
were
*NL*
printed
he
sent
me
about
the
town
to
sell
them
.
The
first
sold
*NL*
wonderfully
,
the
event
being
recent
,
having
made
a
great
noise
.
This
*NL*
flattered
my
vanity
;
but
my
father
discouraged
me
by
ridiculing
my
*NL*
performances
,
and
telling
me
verse-makers
were
generally
beggars
.
So
I
*NL*
escaped
being
a
poet
,
most
probably
a
very
bad
one
;
but
as
prose
*NL*
writing
had
been
of
great
use
to
me
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
and
was
a
*NL*
principal
means
of
my
advancement
,
I
shall
tell
you
how
,
in
such
a
*NL*
situation
,
I
acquired
what
little
ability
I
have
in
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
bookish
lad
in
the
town
,
John
Collins
by
name
,
with
*NL*
whom
I
was
intimately
acquainted
.
We
sometimes
disputed
,
and
very
fond
*NL*
we
were
of
argument
,
and
very
desirous
of
confuting
one
another
,
which
*NL*
disputatious
turn
,
by
the
way
,
is
apt
to
become
a
very
bad
habit
,
*NL*
making
people
often
extremely
disagreeable
in
company
by
the
*NL*
contradiction
that
is
necessary
to
bring
it
into
practice
;
and
thence
,
*NL*
besides
souring
and
spoiling
the
conversation
,
is
productive
of
*NL*
disgusts
and
,
perhaps
enmities
where
you
may
have
occasion
for
*NL*
friendship
.
I
had
caught
it
by
reading
my
father
's
books
of
dispute
*NL*
about
religion
.
Persons
of
good
sense
,
I
have
since
observed
,
seldom
*NL*
fall
into
it
,
except
lawyers
,
university
men
,
and
men
of
all
sorts
that
*NL*
have
been
bred
at
Edinborough
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
question
was
once
,
somehow
or
other
,
started
between
Collins
and
me
,
*NL*
of
the
propriety
of
educating
the
female
sex
in
learning
,
and
their
*NL*
abilities
for
study
.
He
was
of
opinion
that
it
was
improper
,
and
that
*NL*
they
were
naturally
unequal
to
it
.
I
took
the
contrary
side
,
perhaps
a
*NL*
little
for
dispute
's
sake
.
He
was
naturally
more
eloquent
,
had
a
ready
*NL*
plenty
of
words
;
and
sometimes
,
as
I
thought
,
bore
me
down
more
by
his
*NL*
fluency
than
by
the
strength
of
his
reasons
.
As
we
parted
without
*NL*
settling
the
point
,
and
were
not
to
see
one
another
again
for
some
*NL*
time
,
I
sat
down
to
put
my
arguments
in
writing
,
which
I
copied
fair
*NL*
and
sent
to
him
.
He
answered
,
and
I
replied
.
Three
or
four
letters
of
*NL*
a
side
had
passed
,
when
my
father
happened
to
find
my
papers
and
read
*NL*
them
.
Without
entering
into
the
discussion
,
he
took
occasion
to
talk
*NL*
to
me
about
the
manner
of
my
writing
;
observed
that
,
though
I
had
the
*NL*
advantage
of
my
antagonist
in
correct
spelling
and
pointing
-LRB-
which
I
*NL*
ow
'd
to
the
printing-house
-RRB-
,
I
fell
far
short
in
elegance
of
*NL*
expression
,
in
method
and
in
perspicuity
,
of
which
he
convinced
me
by
*NL*
several
instances
.
I
saw
the
justice
of
his
remark
,
and
thence
grew
*NL*
more
attentive
to
the
manner
in
writing
,
and
determined
to
endeavor
at
*NL*
improvement
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
I
met
with
an
odd
volume
of
the
Spectator
.
It
was
the
*NL*
third
.
I
had
never
before
seen
any
of
them
.
I
bought
it
,
read
it
over
*NL*
and
over
,
and
was
much
delighted
with
it
.
I
thought
the
writing
*NL*
excellent
,
and
wished
,
if
possible
,
to
imitate
it
.
With
this
view
I
*NL*
took
some
of
the
papers
,
and
,
making
short
hints
of
the
sentiment
in
*NL*
each
sentence
,
laid
them
by
a
few
days
,
and
then
,
without
looking
at
*NL*
the
book
,
try
'd
to
compleat
the
papers
again
,
by
expressing
each
hinted
*NL*
sentiment
at
length
,
and
as
fully
as
it
had
been
expressed
before
,
in
*NL*
any
suitable
words
that
should
come
to
hand
.
Then
I
compared
my
*NL*
Spectator
with
the
original
,
discovered
some
of
my
faults
,
and
*NL*
corrected
them
.
But
I
found
I
wanted
a
stock
of
words
,
or
a
readiness
*NL*
in
recollecting
and
using
them
,
which
I
thought
I
should
have
acquired
*NL*
before
that
time
if
I
had
gone
on
making
verses
;
since
the
continual
*NL*
occasion
for
words
of
the
same
import
,
but
of
different
length
,
to
suit
*NL*
the
measure
,
or
of
different
sound
for
the
rhyme
,
would
have
laid
me
*NL*
under
a
constant
necessity
of
searching
for
variety
,
and
also
have
*NL*
tended
to
fix
that
variety
in
my
mind
,
and
make
me
master
of
it
.
*NL*
Therefore
I
took
some
of
the
tales
and
turned
them
into
verse
;
and
,
*NL*
after
a
time
,
when
I
had
pretty
well
forgotten
the
prose
,
turned
them
*NL*
back
again
.
I
also
sometimes
jumbled
my
collections
of
hints
into
*NL*
confusion
,
and
after
some
weeks
endeavored
to
reduce
them
into
the
best
*NL*
order
,
before
I
began
to
form
the
full
sentences
and
compleat
the
*NL*
paper
.
This
was
to
teach
me
method
in
the
arrangement
of
thoughts
.
By
*NL*
comparing
my
work
afterwards
with
the
original
,
I
discovered
many
*NL*
faults
and
amended
them
;
but
I
sometimes
had
the
pleasure
of
fancying
*NL*
that
,
in
certain
particulars
of
small
import
,
I
had
been
lucky
enough
*NL*
to
improve
the
method
or
the
language
,
and
this
encouraged
me
to
think
*NL*
I
might
possibly
in
time
come
to
be
a
tolerable
English
writer
,
of
*NL*
which
I
was
extremely
ambitious
.
My
time
for
these
exercises
and
for
*NL*
reading
was
at
night
,
after
work
or
before
it
began
in
the
morning
,
or
*NL*
on
Sundays
,
when
I
contrived
to
be
in
the
printing-house
alone
,
evading
*NL*
as
much
as
I
could
the
common
attendance
on
public
worship
which
my
*NL*
father
used
to
exact
on
me
when
I
was
under
his
care
,
and
which
indeed
*NL*
I
still
thought
a
duty
,
though
I
could
not
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
afford
*NL*
time
to
practise
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
about
16
years
of
age
I
happened
to
meet
with
a
book
,
written
by
*NL*
one
Tryon
,
recommending
a
vegetable
diet
.
I
determined
to
go
into
it
.
*NL*
My
brother
,
being
yet
unmarried
,
did
not
keep
house
,
but
boarded
*NL*
himself
and
his
apprentices
in
another
family
.
My
refusing
to
eat
*NL*
flesh
occasioned
an
inconveniency
,
and
I
was
frequently
chid
for
my
*NL*
singularity
.
I
made
myself
acquainted
with
Tryon
's
manner
of
preparing
*NL*
some
of
his
dishes
,
such
as
boiling
potatoes
or
rice
,
making
hasty
*NL*
pudding
,
and
a
few
others
,
and
then
proposed
to
my
brother
,
that
if
he
*NL*
would
give
me
,
weekly
,
half
the
money
he
paid
for
my
board
,
I
would
*NL*
board
myself
.
He
instantly
agreed
to
it
,
and
I
presently
found
that
I
*NL*
could
save
half
what
he
paid
me
.
This
was
an
additional
fund
for
*NL*
buying
books
.
But
I
had
another
advantage
in
it
.
My
brother
and
the
*NL*
rest
going
from
the
printing-house
to
their
meals
,
I
remained
there
*NL*
alone
,
and
,
despatching
presently
my
light
repast
,
which
often
was
no
*NL*
more
than
a
bisket
or
a
slice
of
bread
,
a
handful
of
raisins
or
a
tart
*NL*
from
the
pastry-cook
's
,
and
a
glass
of
water
,
had
the
rest
of
the
time
*NL*
till
their
return
for
study
,
in
which
I
made
the
greater
progress
,
from
*NL*
that
greater
clearness
of
head
and
quicker
apprehension
which
usually
*NL*
attend
temperance
in
eating
and
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
it
was
that
,
being
on
some
occasion
made
asham
'd
of
my
*NL*
ignorance
in
figures
,
which
I
had
twice
failed
in
learning
when
at
*NL*
school
,
I
took
Cocker
's
book
of
Arithmetick
,
and
went
through
the
whole
*NL*
by
myself
with
great
ease
.
I
also
read
Seller
's
and
Shermy
's
books
of
*NL*
Navigation
,
and
became
acquainted
with
the
little
geometry
they
*NL*
contain
;
but
never
proceeded
far
in
that
science
.
And
I
read
about
*NL*
this
time
Locke
On
Human
Understanding
,
and
the
Art
of
Thinking
,
by
*NL*
Messrs.
du
Port
Royal
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
intent
on
improving
my
language
,
I
met
with
an
English
*NL*
grammar
-LRB-
I
think
it
was
Greenwood
's
-RRB-
,
at
the
end
of
which
there
were
*NL*
two
little
sketches
of
the
arts
of
rhetoric
and
logic
,
the
latter
*NL*
finishing
with
a
specimen
of
a
dispute
in
the
Socratic
method
;
and
soon
*NL*
after
I
procur
'd
Xenophon
's
Memorable
Things
of
Socrates
,
wherein
there
*NL*
are
many
instances
of
the
same
method
.
I
was
charm
'd
with
it
,
adopted
*NL*
it
,
dropt
my
abrupt
contradiction
and
positive
argumentation
,
and
put
*NL*
on
the
humble
inquirer
and
doubter
.
And
being
then
,
from
reading
*NL*
Shaftesbury
and
Collins
,
become
a
real
doubter
in
many
points
of
our
*NL*
religious
doctrine
,
I
found
this
method
safest
for
myself
and
very
*NL*
embarrassing
to
those
against
whom
I
used
it
;
therefore
I
took
a
*NL*
delight
in
it
,
practis
'd
it
continually
,
and
grew
very
artful
and
*NL*
expert
in
drawing
people
,
even
of
superior
knowledge
,
into
concessions
,
*NL*
the
consequences
of
which
they
did
not
foresee
,
entangling
them
in
*NL*
difficulties
out
of
which
they
could
not
extricate
themselves
,
and
so
*NL*
obtaining
victories
that
neither
myself
nor
my
cause
always
deserved
.
*NL*
I
continu
'd
this
method
some
few
years
,
but
gradually
left
it
,
*NL*
retaining
only
the
habit
of
expressing
myself
in
terms
of
modest
*NL*
diffidence
;
never
using
,
when
I
advanced
any
thing
that
may
possibly
be
*NL*
disputed
,
the
words
certainly
,
undoubtedly
,
or
any
others
that
give
the
*NL*
air
of
positiveness
to
an
opinion
;
but
rather
say
,
I
conceive
or
*NL*
apprehend
a
thing
to
be
so
and
so
;
it
appears
to
me
,
or
I
should
think
*NL*
it
so
or
so
,
for
such
and
such
reasons
;
or
I
imagine
it
to
be
so
;
or
it
*NL*
is
so
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
.
This
habit
,
I
believe
,
has
been
of
great
*NL*
advantage
to
me
when
I
have
had
occasion
to
inculcate
my
opinions
,
and
*NL*
persuade
men
into
measures
that
I
have
been
from
time
to
time
engag
'd
*NL*
in
promoting
;
and
,
as
the
chief
ends
of
conversation
are
to
inform
or
*NL*
to
be
informed
,
to
please
or
to
persuade
,
I
wish
well-meaning
,
sensible
*NL*
men
would
not
lessen
their
power
of
doing
good
by
a
positive
,
assuming
*NL*
manner
,
that
seldom
fails
to
disgust
,
tends
to
create
opposition
,
and
*NL*
to
defeat
every
one
of
those
purposes
for
which
speech
was
given
to
us
,
*NL*
to
wit
,
giving
or
receiving
information
or
pleasure
.
For
,
if
you
would
*NL*
inform
,
a
positive
and
dogmatical
manner
in
advancing
your
sentiments
*NL*
may
provoke
contradiction
and
prevent
a
candid
attention
.
If
you
wish
*NL*
information
and
improvement
from
the
knowledge
of
others
,
and
yet
at
*NL*
the
same
time
express
yourself
as
firmly
fix
'd
in
your
present
*NL*
opinions
,
modest
,
sensible
men
,
who
do
not
love
disputation
,
will
*NL*
probably
leave
you
undisturbed
in
the
possession
of
your
error
.
And
by
*NL*
such
a
manner
,
you
can
seldom
hope
to
recommend
yourself
in
pleasing
*NL*
your
hearers
,
or
to
persuade
those
whose
concurrence
you
desire
.
Pope
*NL*
says
,
judiciously
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
should
be
taught
as
if
you
taught
them
not
,
*NL*
And
things
unknown
propos
'd
as
things
forgot
;
''
*NL*
*NL*
farther
recommending
to
us
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
speak
,
tho
'
sure
,
with
seeming
diffidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
might
have
coupled
with
this
line
that
which
he
has
coupled
with
*NL*
another
,
I
think
,
less
properly
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
want
of
modesty
is
want
of
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
ask
,
Why
less
properly
?
I
must
repeat
the
lines
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immodest
words
admit
of
no
defense
,
*NL*
For
want
of
modesty
is
want
of
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
is
not
want
of
sense
-LRB-
where
a
man
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
want
it
-RRB-
*NL*
some
apology
for
his
want
of
modesty
?
and
would
not
the
lines
stand
*NL*
more
justly
thus
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immodest
words
admit
but
this
defense
,
*NL*
That
want
of
modesty
is
want
of
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
however
,
I
should
submit
to
better
judgments
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
brother
had
,
in
1720
or
1721
,
begun
to
print
a
newspaper
.
It
was
*NL*
the
second
that
appeared
in
America
,
and
was
called
the
New
England
*NL*
Courant
.
The
only
one
before
it
was
the
Boston
News-Letter
.
I
remember
*NL*
his
being
dissuaded
by
some
of
his
friends
from
the
undertaking
,
as
not
*NL*
likely
to
succeed
,
one
newspaper
being
,
in
their
judgment
,
enough
for
*NL*
America
.
At
this
time
-LRB-
1771
-RRB-
there
are
not
less
than
five-and-twenty
.
*NL*
He
went
on
,
however
,
with
the
undertaking
,
and
after
having
worked
in
*NL*
composing
the
types
and
printing
off
the
sheets
,
I
was
employed
to
*NL*
carry
the
papers
thro
'
the
streets
to
the
customers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
some
ingenious
men
among
his
friends
,
who
amus
'd
themselves
by
*NL*
writing
little
pieces
for
this
paper
,
which
gain
'd
it
credit
and
made
*NL*
it
more
in
demand
,
and
these
gentlemen
often
visited
us
.
Hearing
their
*NL*
conversations
,
and
their
accounts
of
the
approbation
their
papers
were
*NL*
received
with
,
I
was
excited
to
try
my
hand
among
them
;
but
,
being
*NL*
still
a
boy
,
and
suspecting
that
my
brother
would
object
to
printing
*NL*
anything
of
mine
in
his
paper
if
he
knew
it
to
be
mine
,
I
contrived
to
*NL*
disguise
my
hand
,
and
,
writing
an
anonymous
paper
,
I
put
it
in
at
night
*NL*
under
the
door
of
the
printing-house
.
It
was
found
in
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
communicated
to
his
writing
friends
when
they
call
'd
in
as
usual
.
They
*NL*
read
it
,
commented
on
it
in
my
hearing
,
and
I
had
the
exquisite
*NL*
pleasure
of
finding
it
met
with
their
approbation
,
and
that
,
in
their
*NL*
different
guesses
at
the
author
,
none
were
named
but
men
of
some
*NL*
character
among
us
for
learning
and
ingenuity
.
I
suppose
now
that
I
*NL*
was
rather
lucky
in
my
judges
,
and
that
perhaps
they
were
not
really
so
*NL*
very
good
ones
as
I
then
esteem
'd
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Encourag
'd
,
however
,
by
this
,
I
wrote
and
convey
'd
in
the
same
way
to
*NL*
the
press
several
more
papers
which
were
equally
approv
'd
;
and
I
kept
*NL*
my
secret
till
my
small
fund
of
sense
for
such
performances
was
pretty
*NL*
well
exhausted
and
then
I
discovered
it
,
when
I
began
to
be
considered
*NL*
a
little
more
by
my
brother
's
acquaintance
,
and
in
a
manner
that
did
*NL*
not
quite
please
him
,
as
he
thought
,
probably
with
reason
,
that
it
*NL*
tended
to
make
me
too
vain
.
And
,
perhaps
,
this
might
be
one
occasion
*NL*
of
the
differences
that
we
began
to
have
about
this
time
.
Though
a
*NL*
brother
,
he
considered
himself
as
my
master
,
and
me
as
his
apprentice
,
*NL*
and
accordingly
,
expected
the
same
services
from
me
as
he
would
from
*NL*
another
,
while
I
thought
he
demean
'd
me
too
much
in
some
he
requir
'd
of
*NL*
me
,
who
from
a
brother
expected
more
indulgence
.
Our
disputes
were
*NL*
often
brought
before
our
father
,
and
I
fancy
I
was
either
generally
in
*NL*
the
right
,
or
else
a
better
pleader
,
because
the
judgment
was
generally
*NL*
in
my
favor
.
But
my
brother
was
passionate
,
and
had
often
beaten
me
,
*NL*
which
I
took
extreamly
amiss
;
and
,
thinking
my
apprenticeship
very
*NL*
tedious
,
I
was
continually
wishing
for
some
opportunity
of
shortening
*NL*
it
,
which
at
length
offered
in
a
manner
unexpected
.

*NL*

I
fancy
his
harsh
and
tyrannical
treatment
of
me
*NL*
might
be
a
means
of
impressing
me
with
that
aversion
*NL*
to
arbitrary
power
that
has
stuck
to
me
through
my
*NL*
whole
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
pieces
in
our
newspaper
on
some
political
point
,
which
I
*NL*
have
now
forgotten
,
gave
offense
to
the
Assembly
.
He
was
taken
up
,
*NL*
censur
'd
,
and
imprison
'd
for
a
month
,
by
the
speaker
's
warrant
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
because
he
would
not
discover
his
author
.
I
too
was
taken
up
*NL*
and
examin
'd
before
the
council
;
but
,
tho
'
I
did
not
give
them
any
*NL*
satisfaction
,
they
content
'd
themselves
with
admonishing
me
,
and
*NL*
dismissed
me
,
considering
me
,
perhaps
,
as
an
apprentice
,
who
was
bound
*NL*
to
keep
his
master
's
secrets
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
my
brother
's
confinement
,
which
I
resented
a
good
deal
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
our
private
differences
,
I
had
the
management
of
the
*NL*
paper
;
and
I
made
bold
to
give
our
rulers
some
rubs
in
it
,
which
my
*NL*
brother
took
very
kindly
,
while
others
began
to
consider
me
in
an
*NL*
unfavorable
light
,
as
a
young
genius
that
had
a
turn
for
libelling
and
*NL*
satyr
.
My
brother
's
discharge
was
accompany
'd
with
an
order
of
the
*NL*
House
-LRB-
a
very
odd
one
-RRB-
,
that
``
James
Franklin
should
no
longer
print
the
*NL*
paper
called
the
New
England
Courant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
consultation
held
in
our
printing-house
among
his
friends
,
*NL*
what
he
should
do
in
this
case
.
Some
proposed
to
evade
the
order
by
*NL*
changing
the
name
of
the
paper
;
but
my
brother
,
seeing
inconveniences
*NL*
in
that
,
it
was
finally
concluded
on
as
a
better
way
,
to
let
it
be
*NL*
printed
for
the
future
under
the
name
of
BENJAMIN
FRANKLIN
;
and
to
*NL*
avoid
the
censure
of
the
Assembly
,
that
might
fall
on
him
as
still
*NL*
printing
it
by
his
apprentice
,
the
contrivance
was
that
my
old
*NL*
indenture
should
be
return
'd
to
me
,
with
a
full
discharge
on
the
back
*NL*
of
it
,
to
be
shown
on
occasion
,
but
to
secure
to
him
the
benefit
of
my
*NL*
service
,
I
was
to
sign
new
indentures
for
the
remainder
of
the
term
,
*NL*
which
were
to
be
kept
private
.
A
very
flimsy
scheme
it
was
;
however
,
*NL*
it
was
immediately
executed
,
and
the
paper
went
on
accordingly
,
under
*NL*
my
name
for
several
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
a
fresh
difference
arising
between
my
brother
and
me
,
I
took
*NL*
upon
me
to
assert
my
freedom
,
presuming
that
he
would
not
venture
to
*NL*
produce
the
new
indentures
.
It
was
not
fair
in
me
to
take
this
*NL*
advantage
,
and
this
I
therefore
reckon
one
of
the
first
errata
of
my
*NL*
life
;
but
the
unfairness
of
it
weighed
little
with
me
,
when
under
the
*NL*
impressions
of
resentment
for
the
blows
his
passion
too
often
urged
him
*NL*
to
bestow
upon
me
,
though
he
was
otherwise
not
an
ill-natur
'd
man
:
*NL*
perhaps
I
was
too
saucy
and
provoking
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
found
I
would
leave
him
,
he
took
care
to
prevent
my
getting
*NL*
employment
in
any
other
printing-house
of
the
town
,
by
going
round
and
*NL*
speaking
to
every
master
,
who
accordingly
refus
'd
to
give
me
work
.
I
*NL*
then
thought
of
going
to
New
York
,
as
the
nearest
place
where
there
was
*NL*
a
printer
;
and
I
was
rather
inclin
'd
to
leave
Boston
when
I
reflected
*NL*
that
I
had
already
made
myself
a
little
obnoxious
to
the
governing
*NL*
party
,
and
,
from
the
arbitrary
proceedings
of
the
Assembly
in
my
*NL*
brother
's
case
,
it
was
likely
I
might
,
if
I
stay
'd
,
soon
bring
myself
*NL*
into
scrapes
;
and
farther
,
that
my
indiscrete
disputations
about
*NL*
religion
began
to
make
me
pointed
at
with
horror
by
good
people
as
an
*NL*
infidel
or
atheist
.
I
determin
'd
on
the
point
,
but
my
father
now
*NL*
siding
with
my
brother
,
I
was
sensible
that
,
if
I
attempted
to
go
*NL*
openly
,
means
would
be
used
to
prevent
me
.
My
friend
Collins
,
*NL*
therefore
,
undertook
to
manage
a
little
for
me
.
He
agreed
with
the
*NL*
captain
of
a
New
York
sloop
for
my
passage
,
under
the
notion
of
my
*NL*
being
a
young
acquaintance
of
his
,
that
had
got
a
naughty
girl
with
*NL*
child
,
whose
friends
would
compel
me
to
marry
her
,
and
therefore
I
*NL*
could
not
appear
or
come
away
publicly
.
So
I
sold
some
of
my
books
to
*NL*
raise
a
little
money
,
was
taken
on
board
privately
,
and
as
we
had
a
*NL*
fair
wind
,
in
three
days
I
found
myself
in
New
York
,
near
300
miles
*NL*
from
home
,
a
boy
of
but
17
,
without
the
least
recommendation
to
,
or
*NL*
knowledge
of
any
person
in
the
place
,
and
with
very
little
money
in
my
*NL*
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
inclinations
for
the
sea
were
by
this
time
worne
out
,
or
I
might
now
*NL*
have
gratify
'd
them
.
But
,
having
a
trade
,
and
supposing
myself
a
*NL*
pretty
good
workman
,
I
offer
'd
my
service
to
the
printer
in
the
place
,
*NL*
old
Mr.
William
Bradford
,
who
had
been
the
first
printer
in
*NL*
Pennsylvania
,
but
removed
from
thence
upon
the
quarrel
of
George
Keith
.
*NL*
He
could
give
me
no
employment
,
having
little
to
do
,
and
help
enough
*NL*
already
;
but
says
he
,
``
My
son
at
Philadelphia
has
lately
lost
his
*NL*
principal
hand
,
Aquila
Rose
,
by
death
;
if
you
go
thither
,
I
believe
he
*NL*
may
employ
you
.
''
Philadelphia
was
a
hundred
miles
further
;
I
set
out
,
*NL*
however
,
in
a
boat
for
Amboy
,
leaving
my
chest
and
things
to
follow
me
*NL*
round
by
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
crossing
the
bay
,
we
met
with
a
squall
that
tore
our
rotten
sails
to
*NL*
pieces
,
prevented
our
getting
into
the
Kill
and
drove
us
upon
Long
*NL*
Island
.
In
our
way
,
a
drunken
Dutchman
,
who
was
a
passenger
too
,
fell
*NL*
overboard
;
when
he
was
sinking
,
I
reached
through
the
water
to
his
*NL*
shock
pate
,
and
drew
him
up
,
so
that
we
got
him
in
again
.
His
ducking
*NL*
sobered
him
a
little
,
and
he
went
to
sleep
,
taking
first
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
a
book
,
which
he
desir
'd
I
would
dry
for
him
.
It
proved
to
be
*NL*
my
old
favorite
author
,
Bunyan
's
Pilgrim
's
Progress
,
in
Dutch
,
finely
*NL*
printed
on
good
paper
,
with
copper
cuts
,
a
dress
better
than
I
had
ever
*NL*
seen
it
wear
in
its
own
language
.
I
have
since
found
that
it
has
been
*NL*
translated
into
most
of
the
languages
of
Europe
,
and
suppose
it
has
*NL*
been
more
generally
read
than
any
other
book
,
except
perhaps
the
Bible
.
*NL*
Honest
John
was
the
first
that
I
know
of
who
mix
'd
narration
and
*NL*
dialogue
;
a
method
of
writing
very
engaging
to
the
reader
,
who
in
the
*NL*
most
interesting
parts
finds
himself
,
as
it
were
,
brought
into
the
*NL*
company
and
present
at
the
discourse
.
De
Foe
in
his
Cruso
,
his
Moll
*NL*
Flanders
,
Religious
Courtship
,
Family
Instructor
,
and
other
pieces
,
has
*NL*
imitated
it
with
success
;
and
Richardson
has
done
the
same
,
in
his
*NL*
Pamela
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
drew
near
the
island
,
we
found
it
was
at
a
place
where
there
*NL*
could
be
no
landing
,
there
being
a
great
surff
on
the
stony
beach
.
So
*NL*
we
dropt
anchor
,
and
swung
round
towards
the
shore
.
Some
people
came
*NL*
down
to
the
water
edge
and
hallow
'd
to
us
,
as
we
did
to
them
;
but
the
*NL*
wind
was
so
high
,
and
the
surff
so
loud
,
that
we
could
not
hear
so
as
*NL*
to
understand
each
other
.
There
were
canoes
on
the
shore
,
and
we
made
*NL*
signs
,
and
hallow
'd
that
they
should
fetch
us
;
but
they
either
did
not
*NL*
understand
us
,
or
thought
it
impracticable
,
so
they
went
away
,
and
*NL*
night
coming
on
,
we
had
no
remedy
but
to
wait
till
the
wind
should
*NL*
abate
;
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
the
boatman
and
I
concluded
to
sleep
,
if
*NL*
we
could
;
and
so
crowded
into
the
scuttle
,
with
the
Dutchman
,
who
was
*NL*
still
wet
,
and
the
spray
beating
over
the
head
of
our
boat
,
leak
'd
*NL*
thro
'
to
us
,
so
that
we
were
soon
almost
as
wet
as
he
.
In
this
manner
*NL*
we
lay
all
night
,
with
very
little
rest
;
but
,
the
wind
abating
the
next
*NL*
day
,
we
made
a
shift
to
reach
Amboy
before
night
,
having
been
thirty
*NL*
hours
on
the
water
,
without
victuals
,
or
any
drink
but
a
bottle
of
*NL*
filthy
rum
,
and
the
water
we
sail
'd
on
being
salt
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
I
found
myself
very
feverish
,
and
went
in
to
bed
;
but
,
*NL*
having
read
somewhere
that
cold
water
drank
plentifully
was
good
for
a
*NL*
fever
,
I
follow
'd
the
prescription
,
sweat
plentiful
most
of
the
night
,
*NL*
my
fever
left
me
,
and
in
the
morning
,
crossing
the
ferry
,
I
proceeded
*NL*
on
my
journey
on
foot
,
having
fifty
miles
to
Burlington
,
where
I
was
*NL*
told
I
should
find
boats
that
would
carry
me
the
rest
of
the
way
to
*NL*
Philadelphia
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
rained
very
hard
all
the
day
;
I
was
thoroughly
soak
'd
,
and
by
noon
a
*NL*
good
deal
tired
;
so
I
stopt
at
a
poor
inn
,
where
I
staid
all
night
,
*NL*
beginning
now
to
wish
that
I
had
never
left
home
.
I
cut
so
miserable
a
*NL*
figure
,
too
,
that
I
found
,
by
the
questions
ask
'd
me
,
I
was
suspected
*NL*
to
be
some
runaway
servant
,
and
in
danger
of
being
taken
up
on
that
*NL*
suspicion
.
However
,
I
proceeded
the
next
day
,
and
got
in
the
evening
*NL*
to
an
inn
,
within
eight
or
ten
miles
of
Burlington
,
kept
by
one
Dr.
*NL*
Brown
.
He
entered
into
conversation
with
me
while
I
took
some
*NL*
refreshment
,
and
,
finding
I
had
read
a
little
,
became
very
sociable
and
*NL*
friendly
.
Our
acquaintance
continu
'd
as
long
as
he
liv
'd
.
He
had
been
,
*NL*
I
imagine
,
an
itinerant
doctor
,
for
there
was
no
town
in
England
,
or
*NL*
country
in
Europe
,
of
which
he
could
not
give
a
very
particular
*NL*
account
.
He
had
some
letters
,
and
was
ingenious
,
but
much
of
an
*NL*
unbeliever
,
and
wickedly
undertook
,
some
years
after
,
to
travestie
the
*NL*
Bible
in
doggrel
verse
,
as
Cotton
had
done
Virgil
.
By
this
means
he
*NL*
set
many
of
the
facts
in
a
very
ridiculous
light
,
and
might
have
hurt
*NL*
weak
minds
if
his
work
had
been
published
;
but
it
never
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
house
I
lay
that
night
,
and
the
next
morning
reach
'd
Burlington
,
*NL*
but
had
the
mortification
to
find
that
the
regular
boats
were
gone
a
*NL*
little
before
my
coming
,
and
no
other
expected
to
go
before
Tuesday
,
*NL*
this
being
Saturday
;
wherefore
I
returned
to
an
old
woman
in
the
town
,
*NL*
of
whom
I
had
bought
gingerbread
to
eat
on
the
water
,
and
ask
'd
her
*NL*
advice
.
She
invited
me
to
lodge
at
her
house
till
a
passage
by
water
*NL*
should
offer
;
and
being
tired
with
my
foot
travelling
,
I
accepted
the
*NL*
invitation
.
She
understanding
I
was
a
printer
,
would
have
had
me
stay
*NL*
at
that
town
and
follow
my
business
,
being
ignorant
of
the
stock
*NL*
necessary
to
begin
with
.
She
was
very
hospitable
,
gave
me
a
dinner
of
*NL*
ox-cheek
with
great
good
will
,
accepting
only
a
pot
of
ale
in
return
;
*NL*
and
I
thought
myself
fixed
till
Tuesday
should
come
.
However
,
walking
*NL*
in
the
evening
by
the
side
of
the
river
,
a
boat
came
by
,
which
I
found
*NL*
was
going
towards
Philadelphia
,
with
several
people
in
her
.
They
took
*NL*
me
in
,
and
,
as
there
was
no
wind
,
we
row
'd
all
the
way
;
and
about
*NL*
midnight
,
not
having
yet
seen
the
city
,
some
of
the
company
were
*NL*
confident
we
must
have
passed
it
,
and
would
row
no
farther
;
the
others
*NL*
knew
not
where
we
were
;
so
we
put
toward
the
shore
,
got
into
a
creek
,
*NL*
landed
near
an
old
fence
,
with
the
rails
of
which
we
made
a
fire
,
the
*NL*
night
being
cold
,
in
October
,
and
there
we
remained
till
daylight
.
*NL*
Then
one
of
the
company
knew
the
place
to
be
Cooper
's
Creek
,
a
little
*NL*
above
Philadelphia
,
which
we
saw
as
soon
as
we
got
out
of
the
creek
,
*NL*
and
arriv
'd
there
about
eight
or
nine
o'clock
on
the
Sunday
morning
,
*NL*
and
landed
at
the
Market-street
wharf
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
been
the
more
particular
in
this
description
of
my
journey
,
and
*NL*
shall
be
so
of
my
first
entry
into
that
city
,
that
you
may
in
your
mind
*NL*
compare
such
unlikely
beginnings
with
the
figure
I
have
since
made
*NL*
there
.
I
was
in
my
working
dress
,
my
best
cloaths
being
to
come
round
*NL*
by
sea
.
I
was
dirty
from
my
journey
;
my
pockets
were
stuff
'd
out
with
*NL*
shirts
and
stockings
,
and
I
knew
no
soul
nor
where
to
look
for
lodging
.
*NL*
I
was
fatigued
with
travelling
,
rowing
,
and
want
of
rest
,
I
was
very
*NL*
hungry
;
and
my
whole
stock
of
cash
consisted
of
a
Dutch
dollar
,
and
*NL*
about
a
shilling
in
copper
.
The
latter
I
gave
the
people
of
the
boat
*NL*
for
my
passage
,
who
at
first
refus
'd
it
,
on
account
of
my
rowing
;
but
I
*NL*
insisted
on
their
taking
it
.
A
man
being
sometimes
more
generous
when
*NL*
he
has
but
a
little
money
than
when
he
has
plenty
,
perhaps
thro
'
fear
*NL*
of
being
thought
to
have
but
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
walked
up
the
street
,
gazing
about
till
near
the
market-house
I
*NL*
met
a
boy
with
bread
.
I
had
made
many
a
meal
on
bread
,
and
,
inquiring
*NL*
where
he
got
it
,
I
went
immediately
to
the
baker
's
he
directed
me
to
,
*NL*
in
Secondstreet
,
and
ask
'd
for
bisket
,
intending
such
as
we
had
in
*NL*
Boston
;
but
they
,
it
seems
,
were
not
made
in
Philadelphia
.
Then
I
*NL*
asked
for
a
three-penny
loaf
,
and
was
told
they
had
none
such
.
So
not
*NL*
considering
or
knowing
the
difference
of
money
,
and
the
greater
*NL*
cheapness
nor
the
names
of
his
bread
,
I
made
him
give
me
three-penny
*NL*
worth
of
any
sort
.
He
gave
me
,
accordingly
,
three
great
puffy
rolls
.
*NL*
I
was
surpriz
'd
at
the
quantity
,
but
took
it
,
and
,
having
no
room
in
my
*NL*
pockets
,
walk
'd
off
with
a
roll
under
each
arm
,
and
eating
the
other
.
*NL*
Thus
I
went
up
Market-street
as
far
as
Fourth-street
,
passing
by
the
*NL*
door
of
Mr.
Read
,
my
future
wife
's
father
;
when
she
,
standing
at
the
*NL*
door
,
saw
me
,
and
thought
I
made
,
as
I
certainly
did
,
a
most
awkward
,
*NL*
ridiculous
appearance
.
Then
I
turned
and
went
down
Chestnut-street
and
*NL*
part
of
Walnut-street
,
eating
my
roll
all
the
way
,
and
,
coming
round
,
*NL*
found
myself
again
at
Market-street
wharf
,
near
the
boat
I
came
in
,
to
*NL*
which
I
went
for
a
draught
of
the
river
water
;
and
,
being
filled
with
*NL*
one
of
my
rolls
,
gave
the
other
two
to
a
woman
and
her
child
that
came
*NL*
down
the
river
in
the
boat
with
us
,
and
were
waiting
to
go
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
refreshed
,
I
walked
again
up
the
street
,
which
by
this
time
had
*NL*
many
clean-dressed
people
in
it
,
who
were
all
walking
the
same
way
.
I
*NL*
joined
them
,
and
thereby
was
led
into
the
great
meeting-house
of
the
*NL*
Quakers
near
the
market
.
I
sat
down
among
them
,
and
,
after
looking
*NL*
round
awhile
and
hearing
nothing
said
,
being
very
drowsy
thro
'
labor
*NL*
and
want
of
rest
the
preceding
night
,
I
fell
fast
asleep
,
and
continued
*NL*
so
till
the
meeting
broke
up
,
when
one
was
kind
enough
to
rouse
me
.
*NL*
This
was
,
therefore
,
the
first
house
I
was
in
,
or
slept
in
,
in
*NL*
Philadelphia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walking
down
again
toward
the
river
,
and
,
looking
in
the
faces
of
*NL*
people
,
I
met
a
young
Quaker
man
,
whose
countenance
I
lik
'd
,
and
,
*NL*
accosting
him
,
requested
he
would
tell
me
where
a
stranger
could
get
*NL*
lodging
.
We
were
then
near
the
sign
of
the
Three
Mariners
.
``
Here
,
''
*NL*
says
he
,
``
is
one
place
that
entertains
strangers
,
but
it
is
not
a
*NL*
reputable
house
;
if
thee
wilt
walk
with
me
,
I
'll
show
thee
a
better
.
''
*NL*
He
brought
me
to
the
Crooked
Billet
in
Water-street
.
Here
I
got
a
*NL*
dinner
;
and
,
while
I
was
eating
it
,
several
sly
questions
were
asked
*NL*
me
,
as
it
seemed
to
be
suspected
from
my
youth
and
appearance
,
that
I
*NL*
might
be
some
runaway
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
my
sleepiness
return
'd
,
and
being
shown
to
a
bed
,
I
lay
*NL*
down
without
undressing
,
and
slept
till
six
in
the
evening
,
was
call
'd
*NL*
to
supper
,
went
to
bed
again
very
early
,
and
slept
soundly
till
next
*NL*
morning
.
Then
I
made
myself
as
tidy
as
I
could
,
and
went
to
Andrew
*NL*
Bradford
the
printer
's
.
I
found
in
the
shop
the
old
man
his
father
,
*NL*
whom
I
had
seen
at
New
York
,
and
who
,
travelling
on
horseback
,
had
got
*NL*
to
Philadelphia
before
me
.
He
introduc
'd
me
to
his
son
,
who
receiv
'd
*NL*
me
civilly
,
gave
me
a
breakfast
,
but
told
me
he
did
not
at
present
want
*NL*
a
hand
,
being
lately
suppli
'd
with
one
;
but
there
was
another
printer
*NL*
in
town
,
lately
set
up
,
one
Keimer
,
who
,
perhaps
,
might
employ
me
;
if
*NL*
not
,
I
should
be
welcome
to
lodge
at
his
house
,
and
he
would
give
me
a
*NL*
little
work
to
do
now
and
then
till
fuller
business
should
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
said
he
would
go
with
me
to
the
new
printer
;
and
when
*NL*
we
found
him
,
``
Neighbor
,
''
says
Bradford
,
``
I
have
brought
to
see
you
a
*NL*
young
man
of
your
business
;
perhaps
you
may
want
such
a
one
.
''
He
ask
'd
*NL*
me
a
few
questions
,
put
a
composing
stick
in
my
hand
to
see
how
I
*NL*
work
'd
,
and
then
said
he
would
employ
me
soon
,
though
he
had
just
then
*NL*
nothing
for
me
to
do
;
and
,
taking
old
Bradford
,
whom
he
had
never
seen
*NL*
before
,
to
be
one
of
the
town
's
people
that
had
a
good
will
for
him
,
*NL*
enter
'd
into
a
conversation
on
his
present
undertaking
and
projects
;
*NL*
while
Bradford
,
not
discovering
that
he
was
the
other
printer
's
father
,
*NL*
on
Keimer
's
saying
he
expected
soon
to
get
the
greatest
part
of
the
*NL*
business
into
his
own
hands
,
drew
him
on
by
artful
questions
,
and
*NL*
starting
little
doubts
,
to
explain
all
his
views
,
what
interests
he
*NL*
reli
'd
on
,
and
in
what
manner
he
intended
to
proceed
.
I
,
who
stood
by
*NL*
and
heard
all
,
saw
immediately
that
one
of
them
was
a
crafty
old
*NL*
sophister
,
and
the
other
a
mere
novice
.
Bradford
left
me
with
Keimer
,
*NL*
who
was
greatly
surpris
'd
when
I
told
him
who
the
old
man
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keimer
's
printing-house
,
I
found
,
consisted
of
an
old
shatter
'd
press
,
*NL*
and
one
small
,
worn-out
font
of
English
which
he
was
then
using
*NL*
himself
,
composing
an
Elegy
on
Aquila
Rose
,
before
mentioned
,
an
*NL*
ingenious
young
man
,
of
excellent
character
,
much
respected
in
the
*NL*
town
,
clerk
of
the
Assembly
,
and
a
pretty
poet
.
Keimer
made
verses
*NL*
too
,
but
very
indifferently
.
He
could
not
be
said
to
write
them
,
for
*NL*
his
manner
was
to
compose
them
in
the
types
directly
out
of
his
head
.
*NL*
So
there
being
no
copy
,
but
one
pair
of
cases
,
and
the
Elegy
likely
to
*NL*
require
all
the
letter
,
no
one
could
help
him
.
I
endeavor
'd
to
put
his
*NL*
press
-LRB-
which
he
had
not
yet
us
'd
,
and
of
which
he
understood
nothing
-RRB-
*NL*
into
order
fit
to
be
work
'd
with
;
and
,
promising
to
come
and
print
off
*NL*
his
Elegy
as
soon
as
he
should
have
got
it
ready
,
I
return
'd
to
*NL*
Bradford
's
,
who
gave
me
a
little
job
to
do
for
the
present
,
and
there
I
*NL*
lodged
and
dieted
.
A
few
days
after
,
Keimer
sent
for
me
to
print
off
*NL*
the
Elegy
.
And
now
he
had
got
another
pair
of
cases
,
and
a
pamphlet
to
*NL*
reprint
,
on
which
he
set
me
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
printers
I
found
poorly
qualified
for
their
business
.
*NL*
Bradford
had
not
been
bred
to
it
,
and
was
very
illiterate
;
and
Keimer
,
*NL*
tho
'
something
of
a
scholar
,
was
a
mere
compositor
,
knowing
nothing
of
*NL*
presswork
.
He
had
been
one
of
the
French
prophets
,
and
could
act
their
*NL*
enthusiastic
agitations
.
At
this
time
he
did
not
profess
any
*NL*
particular
religion
,
but
something
of
all
on
occasion
;
was
very
*NL*
ignorant
of
the
world
,
and
had
,
as
I
afterward
found
,
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
the
knave
in
his
composition
.
He
did
not
like
my
lodging
at
Bradford
's
*NL*
while
I
work
'd
with
him
.
He
had
a
house
,
indeed
,
but
without
*NL*
furniture
,
so
he
could
not
lodge
me
;
but
he
got
me
a
lodging
at
Mr.
*NL*
Read
's
,
before
mentioned
,
who
was
the
owner
of
his
house
;
and
,
my
chest
*NL*
and
clothes
being
come
by
this
time
,
I
made
rather
a
more
respectable
*NL*
appearance
in
the
eyes
of
Miss
Read
than
I
had
done
when
she
first
*NL*
happen
'd
to
see
me
eating
my
roll
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
now
to
have
some
acquaintance
among
the
young
people
of
the
*NL*
town
,
that
were
lovers
of
reading
,
with
whom
I
spent
my
evenings
very
*NL*
pleasantly
;
and
gaining
money
by
my
industry
and
frugality
,
I
lived
*NL*
very
agreeably
,
forgetting
Boston
as
much
as
I
could
,
and
not
desiring
*NL*
that
any
there
should
know
where
I
resided
,
except
my
friend
Collins
,
*NL*
who
was
in
my
secret
,
and
kept
it
when
I
wrote
to
him
.
At
length
,
an
*NL*
incident
happened
that
sent
me
back
again
much
sooner
than
I
had
*NL*
intended
.
I
had
a
brother-in-law
,
Robert
Holmes
,
master
of
a
sloop
*NL*
that
traded
between
Boston
and
Delaware
.
He
being
at
Newcastle
,
forty
*NL*
miles
below
Philadelphia
,
heard
there
of
me
,
and
wrote
me
a
letter
*NL*
mentioning
the
concern
of
my
friends
in
Boston
at
my
abrupt
departure
,
*NL*
assuring
me
of
their
good
will
to
me
,
and
that
every
thing
would
be
*NL*
accommodated
to
my
mind
if
I
would
return
,
to
which
he
exhorted
me
very
*NL*
earnestly
.
I
wrote
an
answer
to
his
letter
,
thank
'd
him
for
his
*NL*
advice
,
but
stated
my
reasons
for
quitting
Boston
fully
and
in
such
a
*NL*
light
as
to
convince
him
I
was
not
so
wrong
as
he
had
apprehended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
William
Keith
,
governor
of
the
province
,
was
then
at
Newcastle
,
and
*NL*
Captain
Holmes
,
happening
to
be
in
company
with
him
when
my
letter
came
*NL*
to
hand
,
spoke
to
him
of
me
,
and
show
'd
him
the
letter
.
The
governor
*NL*
read
it
,
and
seem
'd
surpris
'd
when
he
was
told
my
age
.
He
said
I
*NL*
appear
'd
a
young
man
of
promising
parts
,
and
therefore
should
be
*NL*
encouraged
;
the
printers
at
Philadelphia
were
wretched
ones
;
and
,
if
I
*NL*
would
set
up
there
,
he
made
no
doubt
I
should
succeed
;
for
his
part
,
he
*NL*
would
procure
me
the
public
business
,
and
do
me
every
other
service
in
*NL*
his
power
.
This
my
brother-in-law
afterwards
told
me
in
Boston
,
but
I
*NL*
knew
as
yet
nothing
of
it
;
when
,
one
day
,
Keimer
and
I
being
at
work
*NL*
together
near
the
window
,
we
saw
the
governor
and
another
gentleman
*NL*
-LRB-
which
proved
to
be
Colonel
French
,
of
Newcastle
-RRB-
,
finely
dress
'd
,
come
*NL*
directly
across
the
street
to
our
house
,
and
heard
them
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keimer
ran
down
immediately
,
thinking
it
a
visit
to
him
;
but
the
*NL*
governor
inquir
'd
for
me
,
came
up
,
and
with
a
condescension
of
*NL*
politeness
I
had
been
quite
unus
'd
to
,
made
me
many
compliments
,
*NL*
desired
to
be
acquainted
with
me
,
blam
'd
me
kindly
for
not
having
made
*NL*
myself
known
to
him
when
I
first
came
to
the
place
,
and
would
have
me
*NL*
away
with
him
to
the
tavern
,
where
he
was
going
with
Colonel
French
to
*NL*
taste
,
as
he
said
,
some
excellent
Madeira
.
I
was
not
a
little
*NL*
surprised
,
and
Keimer
star
'd
like
a
pig
poison
'd
.
I
went
,
however
,
*NL*
with
the
governor
and
Colonel
French
to
a
tavern
,
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
Third-street
,
and
over
the
Madeira
he
propos
'd
my
setting
up
my
*NL*
business
,
laid
before
me
the
probabilities
of
success
,
and
both
he
and
*NL*
Colonel
French
assur
'd
me
I
should
have
their
interest
and
influence
in
*NL*
procuring
the
public
business
of
both
governments
.
On
my
doubting
*NL*
whether
my
father
would
assist
me
in
it
,
Sir
William
said
he
would
give
*NL*
me
a
letter
to
him
,
in
which
he
would
state
the
advantages
,
and
he
did
*NL*
not
doubt
of
prevailing
with
him
.
So
it
was
concluded
I
should
return
*NL*
to
Boston
in
the
first
vessel
,
with
the
governor
's
letter
recommending
*NL*
me
to
my
father
.
In
the
mean
time
the
intention
was
to
be
kept
a
*NL*
secret
,
and
I
went
on
working
with
Keimer
as
usual
,
the
governor
*NL*
sending
for
me
now
and
then
to
dine
with
him
,
a
very
great
honor
I
*NL*
thought
it
,
and
conversing
with
me
in
the
most
affable
,
familiar
,
and
*NL*
friendly
manner
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
end
of
April
,
1724
,
a
little
vessel
offer
'd
for
Boston
.
I
*NL*
took
leave
of
Keimer
as
going
to
see
my
friends
.
The
governor
gave
me
*NL*
an
ample
letter
,
saying
many
flattering
things
of
me
to
my
father
,
and
*NL*
strongly
recommending
the
project
of
my
setting
up
at
Philadelphia
as
a
*NL*
thing
that
must
make
my
fortune
.
We
struck
on
a
shoal
in
going
down
*NL*
the
bay
,
and
sprung
a
leak
;
we
had
a
blustering
time
at
sea
,
and
were
*NL*
oblig
'd
to
pump
almost
continually
,
at
which
I
took
my
turn
.
We
*NL*
arriv
'd
safe
,
however
,
at
Boston
in
about
a
fortnight
.
I
had
been
*NL*
absent
seven
months
,
and
my
friends
had
heard
nothing
of
me
;
for
my
br
.
*NL*
Holmes
was
not
yet
return
'd
,
and
had
not
written
about
me
.
My
*NL*
unexpected
appearance
surpriz
'd
the
family
;
all
were
,
however
,
very
*NL*
glad
to
see
me
,
and
made
me
welcome
,
except
my
brother
.
I
went
to
see
*NL*
him
at
his
printing-house
.
I
was
better
dress
'd
than
ever
while
in
his
*NL*
service
,
having
a
genteel
new
suit
from
head
to
foot
,
a
watch
,
and
my
*NL*
pockets
lin
'd
with
near
five
pounds
sterling
in
silver
.
He
receiv
'd
me
*NL*
not
very
frankly
,
look
'd
me
all
over
,
and
turn
'd
to
his
work
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
journeymen
were
inquisitive
where
I
had
been
,
what
sort
of
a
*NL*
country
it
was
,
and
how
I
lik
'd
it
.
I
prais
'd
it
much
,
the
happy
life
*NL*
I
led
in
it
,
expressing
strongly
my
intention
of
returning
to
it
;
and
,
*NL*
one
of
them
asking
what
kind
of
money
we
had
there
,
I
produc
'd
a
*NL*
handful
of
silver
,
and
spread
it
before
them
,
which
was
a
kind
of
*NL*
raree-show
they
had
not
been
us
'd
to
,
paper
being
the
money
of
Boston
.
*NL*
Then
I
took
an
opportunity
of
letting
them
see
my
watch
;
and
,
lastly
*NL*
-LRB-
my
brother
still
grum
and
sullen
-RRB-
,
I
gave
them
a
piece
of
eight
to
*NL*
drink
,
and
took
my
leave
.
This
visit
of
mine
offended
him
extreamly
;
*NL*
for
,
when
my
mother
some
time
after
spoke
to
him
of
a
reconciliation
,
*NL*
and
of
her
wishes
to
see
us
on
good
terms
together
,
and
that
we
might
*NL*
live
for
the
future
as
brothers
,
he
said
I
had
insulted
him
in
such
a
*NL*
manner
before
his
people
that
he
could
never
forget
or
forgive
it
.
In
*NL*
this
,
however
,
he
was
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
received
the
governor
's
letter
with
some
apparent
surprise
,
*NL*
but
said
little
of
it
to
me
for
some
days
,
when
Capt.
Holmes
returning
*NL*
he
showed
it
to
him
,
ask
'd
him
if
he
knew
Keith
,
and
what
kind
of
man
*NL*
he
was
;
adding
his
opinion
that
he
must
be
of
small
discretion
to
think
*NL*
of
setting
a
boy
up
in
business
who
wanted
yet
three
years
of
being
at
*NL*
man
's
estate
.
Holmes
said
what
he
could
in
favor
of
the
project
,
but
*NL*
my
father
was
clear
in
the
impropriety
of
it
,
and
at
last
gave
a
flat
*NL*
denial
to
it
.
Then
he
wrote
a
civil
letter
to
Sir
William
,
thanking
*NL*
him
for
the
patronage
he
had
so
kindly
offered
me
,
but
declining
to
*NL*
assist
me
as
yet
in
setting
up
,
I
being
,
in
his
opinion
,
too
young
to
*NL*
be
trusted
with
the
management
of
a
business
so
important
,
and
for
*NL*
which
the
preparation
must
be
so
expensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
friend
and
companion
Collins
,
who
was
a
clerk
in
the
post-office
,
*NL*
pleas
'd
with
the
account
I
gave
him
of
my
new
country
,
determined
to
go
*NL*
thither
also
;
and
,
while
I
waited
for
my
father
's
determination
,
he
set
*NL*
out
before
me
by
land
to
Rhode
Island
,
leaving
his
books
,
which
were
a
*NL*
pretty
collection
of
mathematicks
and
natural
philosophy
,
to
come
with
*NL*
mine
and
me
to
New
York
,
where
he
propos
'd
to
wait
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
tho
'
he
did
not
approve
Sir
William
's
proposition
,
was
yet
*NL*
pleas
'd
that
I
had
been
able
to
obtain
so
advantageous
a
character
from
*NL*
a
person
of
such
note
where
I
had
resided
,
and
that
I
had
been
so
*NL*
industrious
and
careful
as
to
equip
myself
so
handsomely
in
so
short
a
*NL*
time
;
therefore
,
seeing
no
prospect
of
an
accommodation
between
my
*NL*
brother
and
me
,
he
gave
his
consent
to
my
returning
again
to
*NL*
Philadelphia
,
advis
'd
me
to
behave
respectfully
to
the
people
there
,
*NL*
endeavor
to
obtain
the
general
esteem
,
and
avoid
lampooning
and
*NL*
libeling
,
to
which
he
thought
I
had
too
much
inclination
;
telling
me
,
*NL*
that
by
steady
industry
and
a
prudent
parsimony
I
might
save
enough
by
*NL*
the
time
I
was
one-and-twenty
to
set
me
up
;
and
that
,
if
I
came
near
*NL*
the
matter
,
he
would
help
me
out
with
the
rest
.
This
was
all
I
could
*NL*
obtain
,
except
some
small
gifts
as
tokens
of
his
and
my
mother
's
love
,
*NL*
when
I
embark
'd
again
for
New
York
,
now
with
their
approbation
and
*NL*
their
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sloop
putting
in
at
Newport
,
Rhode
Island
,
I
visited
my
brother
*NL*
John
,
who
had
been
married
and
settled
there
some
years
.
He
received
*NL*
me
very
affectionately
,
for
he
always
lov
'd
me
.
A
friend
of
his
,
one
*NL*
Vernon
,
having
some
money
due
to
him
in
Pensilvania
,
about
thirty-five
*NL*
pounds
currency
,
desired
I
would
receive
it
for
him
,
and
keep
it
till
I
*NL*
had
his
directions
what
to
remit
it
in
.
Accordingly
,
he
gave
me
an
*NL*
order
.
This
afterwards
occasion
'd
me
a
good
deal
of
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Newport
we
took
in
a
number
of
passengers
for
New
York
,
among
which
*NL*
were
two
young
women
,
companions
,
and
a
grave
,
sensible
,
matron-like
*NL*
Quaker
woman
,
with
her
attendants
.
I
had
shown
an
obliging
readiness
*NL*
to
do
her
some
little
services
,
which
impress
'd
her
I
suppose
with
a
*NL*
degree
of
good
will
toward
me
;
therefore
,
when
she
saw
a
daily
growing
*NL*
familiarity
between
me
and
the
two
young
women
,
which
they
appear
'd
to
*NL*
encourage
,
she
took
me
aside
,
and
said
:
``
Young
man
,
I
am
concern
'd
for
*NL*
thee
,
as
thou
has
no
friend
with
thee
,
and
seems
not
to
know
much
of
*NL*
the
world
,
or
of
the
snares
youth
is
expos
'd
to
;
depend
upon
it
,
those
*NL*
are
very
bad
women
;
I
can
see
it
in
all
their
actions
;
and
if
thee
art
*NL*
not
upon
thy
guard
,
they
will
draw
thee
into
some
danger
;
they
are
*NL*
strangers
to
thee
,
and
I
advise
thee
,
in
a
friendly
concern
for
thy
*NL*
welfare
,
to
have
no
acquaintance
with
them
.
''
As
I
seem
'd
at
first
not
*NL*
to
think
so
ill
of
them
as
she
did
,
she
mentioned
some
things
she
had
*NL*
observ
'd
and
heard
that
had
escap
'd
my
notice
,
but
now
convinc
'd
me
she
*NL*
was
right
.
I
thank
'd
her
for
her
kind
advice
,
and
promis
'd
to
follow
*NL*
it
.
When
we
arriv
'd
at
New
York
,
they
told
me
where
they
liv
'd
,
and
*NL*
invited
me
to
come
and
see
them
;
but
I
avoided
it
,
and
it
was
well
I
*NL*
did
;
for
the
next
day
the
captain
miss
'd
a
silver
spoon
and
some
other
*NL*
things
,
that
had
been
taken
out
of
his
cabbin
,
and
,
knowing
that
these
*NL*
were
a
couple
of
strumpets
,
he
got
a
warrant
to
search
their
lodgings
,
*NL*
found
the
stolen
goods
,
and
had
the
thieves
punish
'd
.
So
,
tho
'
we
had
*NL*
escap
'd
a
sunken
rock
,
which
we
scrap
'd
upon
in
the
passage
,
I
thought
*NL*
this
escape
of
rather
more
importance
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
New
York
I
found
my
friend
Collins
,
who
had
arriv
'd
there
some
time
*NL*
before
me
.
We
had
been
intimate
from
children
,
and
had
read
the
same
*NL*
books
together
;
but
he
had
the
advantage
of
more
time
for
reading
and
*NL*
studying
,
and
a
wonderful
genius
for
mathematical
learning
,
in
which
he
*NL*
far
outstript
me
.
While
I
liv
'd
in
Boston
most
of
my
hours
of
leisure
*NL*
for
conversation
were
spent
with
him
,
and
he
continu
'd
a
sober
as
well
*NL*
as
an
industrious
lad
;
was
much
respected
for
his
learning
by
several
*NL*
of
the
clergy
and
other
gentlemen
,
and
seemed
to
promise
making
a
good
*NL*
figure
in
life
.
But
,
during
my
absence
,
he
had
acquir
'd
a
habit
of
*NL*
sotting
with
brandy
;
and
I
found
by
his
own
account
,
and
what
I
heard
*NL*
from
others
,
that
he
had
been
drunk
every
day
since
his
arrival
at
New
*NL*
York
,
and
behav
'd
very
oddly
.
He
had
gam
'd
,
too
,
and
lost
his
money
,
*NL*
so
that
I
was
oblig
'd
to
discharge
his
lodgings
,
and
defray
his
*NL*
expenses
to
and
at
Philadelphia
,
which
prov
'd
extremely
inconvenient
to
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
then
governor
of
New
York
,
Burnet
-LRB-
son
of
Bishop
Burnet
-RRB-
,
hearing
*NL*
from
the
captain
that
a
young
man
,
one
of
his
passengers
,
had
a
great
*NL*
many
books
,
desir
'd
he
would
bring
me
to
see
him
.
I
waited
upon
him
*NL*
accordingly
,
and
should
have
taken
Collins
with
me
but
that
he
was
not
*NL*
sober
.
The
gov
`
r.
treated
me
with
great
civility
,
show
'd
me
his
*NL*
library
,
which
was
a
very
large
one
,
and
we
had
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
conversation
about
books
and
authors
.
This
was
the
second
governor
who
*NL*
had
done
me
the
honor
to
take
notice
of
me
;
which
,
to
a
poor
boy
like
*NL*
me
,
was
very
pleasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
proceeded
to
Philadelphia
.
I
received
on
the
way
Vernon
's
money
,
*NL*
without
which
we
could
hardly
have
finish
'd
our
journey
.
Collins
*NL*
wished
to
be
employ
'd
in
some
counting-house
,
but
,
whether
they
*NL*
discover
'd
his
dramming
by
his
breath
,
or
by
his
behaviour
,
tho
'
he
had
*NL*
some
recommendations
,
he
met
with
no
success
in
any
application
,
and
*NL*
continu
'd
lodging
and
boarding
at
the
same
house
with
me
,
and
at
my
*NL*
expense
.
Knowing
I
had
that
money
of
Vernon
's
,
he
was
continually
*NL*
borrowing
of
me
,
still
promising
repayment
as
soon
as
he
should
be
in
*NL*
business
.
At
length
he
had
got
so
much
of
it
that
I
was
distress
'd
to
*NL*
think
what
I
should
do
in
case
of
being
call
'd
on
to
remit
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
drinking
continu
'd
,
about
which
we
sometimes
quarrell
'd
;
for
,
when
*NL*
a
little
intoxicated
,
he
was
very
fractious
.
Once
,
in
a
boat
on
the
*NL*
Delaware
with
some
other
young
men
,
he
refused
to
row
in
his
turn
.
``
I
*NL*
will
be
row
'd
home
,
''
says
he
.
``
We
will
not
row
you
,
''
says
I.
``
You
*NL*
must
,
or
stay
all
night
on
the
water
,
''
says
he
,
``
just
as
you
please
.
''
*NL*
The
others
said
,
``
Let
us
row
;
what
signifies
it
?
''
But
,
my
mind
being
*NL*
soured
with
his
other
conduct
,
I
continu
'd
to
refuse
.
So
he
swore
he
*NL*
would
make
me
row
,
or
throw
me
overboard
;
and
coming
along
,
stepping
on
*NL*
the
thwarts
,
toward
me
,
when
he
came
up
and
struck
at
me
,
I
clapped
my
*NL*
hand
under
his
crutch
,
and
,
rising
,
pitched
him
head-foremost
into
the
*NL*
river
.
I
knew
he
was
a
good
swimmer
,
and
so
was
under
little
concern
*NL*
about
him
;
but
before
he
could
get
round
to
lay
hold
of
the
boat
,
we
*NL*
had
with
a
few
strokes
pull
'd
her
out
of
his
reach
;
and
ever
when
he
*NL*
drew
near
the
boat
,
we
ask
'd
if
he
would
row
,
striking
a
few
strokes
to
*NL*
slide
her
away
from
him
.
He
was
ready
to
die
with
vexation
,
and
*NL*
obstinately
would
not
promise
to
row
.
However
,
seeing
him
at
last
*NL*
beginning
to
tire
,
we
lifted
him
in
and
brought
him
home
dripping
wet
*NL*
in
the
evening
.
We
hardly
exchang
'd
a
civil
word
afterwards
,
and
a
*NL*
West
India
captain
,
who
had
a
commission
to
procure
a
tutor
for
the
*NL*
sons
of
a
gentleman
at
Barbadoes
,
happening
to
meet
with
him
,
agreed
to
*NL*
carry
him
thither
.
He
left
me
then
,
promising
to
remit
me
the
first
*NL*
money
he
should
receive
in
order
to
discharge
the
debt
;
but
I
never
*NL*
heard
of
him
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breaking
into
this
money
of
Vernon
's
was
one
of
the
first
great
*NL*
errata
of
my
life
;
and
this
affair
show
'd
that
my
father
was
not
much
*NL*
out
in
his
judgment
when
he
suppos
'd
me
too
young
to
manage
business
of
*NL*
importance
.
But
Sir
William
,
on
reading
his
letter
,
said
he
was
too
*NL*
prudent
.
There
was
great
difference
in
persons
;
and
discretion
did
not
*NL*
always
accompany
years
,
nor
was
youth
always
without
it
.
``
And
since
he
*NL*
will
not
set
you
up
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
will
do
it
myself
.
Give
me
an
*NL*
inventory
of
the
things
necessary
to
be
had
from
England
,
and
I
will
*NL*
send
for
them
.
You
shall
repay
me
when
you
are
able
;
I
am
resolv
'd
to
*NL*
have
a
good
printer
here
,
and
I
am
sure
you
must
succeed
.
''
This
was
*NL*
spoken
with
such
an
appearance
of
cordiality
,
that
I
had
not
the
least
*NL*
doubt
of
his
meaning
what
he
said
.
I
had
hitherto
kept
the
proposition
*NL*
of
my
setting
up
,
a
secret
in
Philadelphia
,
and
I
still
kept
it
.
Had
*NL*
it
been
known
that
I
depended
on
the
governor
,
probably
some
friend
,
*NL*
that
knew
him
better
,
would
have
advis
'd
me
not
to
rely
on
him
,
as
I
*NL*
afterwards
heard
it
as
his
known
character
to
be
liberal
of
promises
*NL*
which
he
never
meant
to
keep
.
Yet
,
unsolicited
as
he
was
by
me
,
how
*NL*
could
I
think
his
generous
offers
insincere
?
I
believ
'd
him
one
of
the
*NL*
best
men
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
presented
him
an
inventory
of
a
little
print
`
g-house
,
amounting
by
my
*NL*
computation
to
about
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
.
He
lik
'd
it
,
but
*NL*
ask
'd
me
if
my
being
on
the
spot
in
England
to
chuse
the
types
,
and
see
*NL*
that
every
thing
was
good
of
the
kind
,
might
not
be
of
some
advantage
.
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
says
he
,
``
when
there
,
you
may
make
acquaintances
,
and
establish
*NL*
correspondences
in
the
bookselling
and
stationery
way
.
''
I
agreed
that
*NL*
this
might
be
advantageous
.
``
Then
,
''
says
he
,
``
get
yourself
ready
to
go
*NL*
with
Annis
;
''
which
was
the
annual
ship
,
and
the
only
one
at
that
time
*NL*
usually
passing
between
London
and
Philadelphia
.
But
it
would
be
some
*NL*
months
before
Annis
sail
'd
,
so
I
continu
'd
working
with
Keimer
,
*NL*
fretting
about
the
money
Collins
had
got
from
me
,
and
in
daily
*NL*
apprehensions
of
being
call
'd
upon
by
Vernon
,
which
,
however
,
did
not
*NL*
happen
for
some
years
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
I
have
omitted
mentioning
that
,
in
my
first
voyage
from
*NL*
Boston
,
being
becalm
'd
off
Block
Island
,
our
people
set
about
catching
*NL*
cod
,
and
hauled
up
a
great
many
.
Hitherto
I
had
stuck
to
my
resolution
*NL*
of
not
eating
animal
food
,
and
on
this
occasion
consider
'd
,
with
my
*NL*
master
Tryon
,
the
taking
every
fish
as
a
kind
of
unprovoked
murder
,
*NL*
since
none
of
them
had
,
or
ever
could
do
us
any
injury
that
might
*NL*
justify
the
slaughter
.
All
this
seemed
very
reasonable
.
But
I
had
*NL*
formerly
been
a
great
lover
of
fish
,
and
,
when
this
came
hot
out
of
the
*NL*
frying-pan
,
it
smelt
admirably
well
.
I
balanc
'd
some
time
between
*NL*
principle
and
inclination
,
till
I
recollected
that
,
when
the
fish
were
*NL*
opened
,
I
saw
smaller
fish
taken
out
of
their
stomachs
;
then
thought
I
,
*NL*
``
If
you
eat
one
another
,
I
do
n't
see
why
we
may
n't
eat
you
.
''
So
I
*NL*
din
'd
upon
cod
very
heartily
,
and
continued
to
eat
with
other
people
,
*NL*
returning
only
now
and
then
occasionally
to
a
vegetable
diet
.
So
*NL*
convenient
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
reasonable
creature
,
since
it
enables
*NL*
one
to
find
or
make
a
reason
for
everything
one
has
a
mind
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keimer
and
I
liv
'd
on
a
pretty
good
familiar
footing
,
and
agreed
*NL*
tolerably
well
,
for
he
suspected
nothing
of
my
setting
up
.
He
retained
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
his
old
enthusiasms
and
lov
'd
argumentation
.
We
*NL*
therefore
had
many
disputations
.
I
used
to
work
him
so
with
my
*NL*
Socratic
method
,
and
had
trepann
'd
him
so
often
by
questions
apparently
*NL*
so
distant
from
any
point
we
had
in
hand
,
and
yet
by
degrees
lead
to
*NL*
the
point
,
and
brought
him
into
difficulties
and
contradictions
,
that
*NL*
at
last
he
grew
ridiculously
cautious
,
and
would
hardly
answer
me
the
*NL*
most
common
question
,
without
asking
first
,
``
What
do
you
intend
to
*NL*
infer
from
that
?
''
However
,
it
gave
him
so
high
an
opinion
of
my
*NL*
abilities
in
the
confuting
way
,
that
he
seriously
proposed
my
being
his
*NL*
colleague
in
a
project
he
had
of
setting
up
a
new
sect
.
He
was
to
*NL*
preach
the
doctrines
,
and
I
was
to
confound
all
opponents
.
When
he
*NL*
came
to
explain
with
me
upon
the
doctrines
,
I
found
several
conundrums
*NL*
which
I
objected
to
,
unless
I
might
have
my
way
a
little
too
,
and
*NL*
introduce
some
of
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Keimer
wore
his
beard
at
full
length
,
because
somewhere
in
the
Mosaic
*NL*
law
it
is
said
,
``
Thou
shalt
not
mar
the
corners
of
thy
beard
.
''
He
*NL*
likewise
kept
the
Seventh
day
,
Sabbath
;
and
these
two
points
were
*NL*
essentials
with
him
.
I
dislik
'd
both
;
but
agreed
to
admit
them
upon
*NL*
condition
of
his
adopting
the
doctrine
of
using
no
animal
food
.
``
I
*NL*
doubt
,
''
said
he
,
``
my
constitution
will
not
bear
that
.
''
I
assur
'd
him
*NL*
it
would
,
and
that
he
would
be
the
better
for
it
.
He
was
usually
a
*NL*
great
glutton
,
and
I
promised
myself
some
diversion
in
half
starving
*NL*
him
.
He
agreed
to
try
the
practice
,
if
I
would
keep
him
company
.
I
*NL*
did
so
,
and
we
held
it
for
three
months
.
We
had
our
victuals
dress
'd
,
*NL*
and
brought
to
us
regularly
by
a
woman
in
the
neighborhood
,
who
had
*NL*
from
me
a
list
of
forty
dishes
to
be
prepar
'd
for
us
at
different
*NL*
times
,
in
all
which
there
was
neither
fish
,
flesh
,
nor
fowl
,
and
the
*NL*
whim
suited
me
the
better
at
this
time
from
the
cheapness
of
it
,
not
*NL*
costing
us
above
eighteenpence
sterling
each
per
week
.
I
have
since
*NL*
kept
several
Lents
most
strictly
,
leaving
the
common
diet
for
that
,
and
*NL*
that
for
the
common
,
abruptly
,
without
the
least
inconvenience
,
so
that
*NL*
I
think
there
is
little
in
the
advice
of
making
those
changes
by
easy
*NL*
gradations
.
I
went
on
pleasantly
,
but
poor
Keimer
suffered
grievously
,
*NL*
tired
of
the
project
,
long
'd
for
the
flesh-pots
of
Egypt
,
and
order
'd
a
*NL*
roast
pig
.
He
invited
me
and
two
women
friends
to
dine
with
him
;
but
,
*NL*
it
being
brought
too
soon
upon
table
,
he
could
not
resist
the
*NL*
temptation
,
and
ate
the
whole
before
we
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
made
some
courtship
during
this
time
to
Miss
Read
.
I
had
a
great
*NL*
respect
and
affection
for
her
,
and
had
some
reason
to
believe
she
had
*NL*
the
same
for
me
;
but
,
as
I
was
about
to
take
a
long
voyage
,
and
we
were
*NL*
both
very
young
,
only
a
little
above
eighteen
,
it
was
thought
most
*NL*
prudent
by
her
mother
to
prevent
our
going
too
far
at
present
,
as
a
*NL*
marriage
,
if
it
was
to
take
place
,
would
be
more
convenient
after
my
*NL*
return
,
when
I
should
be
,
as
I
expected
,
set
up
in
my
business
.
*NL*
Perhaps
,
too
,
she
thought
my
expectations
not
so
well
founded
as
I
*NL*
imagined
them
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
chief
acquaintances
at
this
time
were
Charles
Osborne
,
Joseph
*NL*
Watson
,
and
James
Ralph
,
all
lovers
of
reading
.
The
two
first
were
*NL*
clerks
to
an
eminent
scrivener
or
conveyancer
in
the
town
,
Charles
*NL*
Brogden
;
the
other
was
clerk
to
a
merchant
.
Watson
was
a
pious
,
*NL*
sensible
young
man
,
of
great
integrity
;
the
others
rather
more
lax
in
*NL*
their
principles
of
religion
,
particularly
Ralph
,
who
,
as
well
as
*NL*
Collins
,
had
been
unsettled
by
me
,
for
which
they
both
made
me
suffer
.
*NL*
Osborne
was
sensible
,
candid
,
frank
;
sincere
and
affectionate
to
his
*NL*
friends
;
but
,
in
literary
matters
,
too
fond
of
criticising
.
Ralph
was
*NL*
ingenious
,
genteel
in
his
manners
,
and
extremely
eloquent
;
I
think
I
*NL*
never
knew
a
prettier
talker
.
Both
of
them
great
admirers
of
poetry
,
*NL*
and
began
to
try
their
hands
in
little
pieces
.
Many
pleasant
walks
we
*NL*
four
had
together
on
Sundays
into
the
woods
,
near
Schuylkill
,
where
we
*NL*
read
to
one
another
,
and
conferr
'd
on
what
we
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
was
inclin
'd
to
pursue
the
study
of
poetry
,
not
doubting
but
he
*NL*
might
become
eminent
in
it
,
and
make
his
fortune
by
it
,
alleging
that
*NL*
the
best
poets
must
,
when
they
first
began
to
write
,
make
as
many
*NL*
faults
as
he
did
.
Osborne
dissuaded
him
,
assur
'd
him
he
had
no
genius
*NL*
for
poetry
,
and
advis
'd
him
to
think
of
nothing
beyond
the
business
he
*NL*
was
bred
to
;
that
,
in
the
mercantile
way
,
tho
'
he
had
no
stock
,
he
*NL*
might
,
by
his
diligence
and
punctuality
,
recommend
himself
to
*NL*
employment
as
a
factor
,
and
in
time
acquire
wherewith
to
trade
on
his
*NL*
own
account
.
I
approv
'd
the
amusing
one
's
self
with
poetry
now
and
*NL*
then
,
so
far
as
to
improve
one
's
language
,
but
no
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
it
was
propos
'd
that
we
should
each
of
us
,
at
our
next
meeting
,
*NL*
produce
a
piece
of
our
own
composing
,
in
order
to
improve
by
our
mutual
*NL*
observations
,
criticisms
,
and
corrections
.
As
language
and
expression
*NL*
were
what
we
had
in
view
,
we
excluded
all
considerations
of
invention
*NL*
by
agreeing
that
the
task
should
be
a
version
of
the
eighteenth
Psalm
,
*NL*
which
describes
the
descent
of
a
Deity
.
When
the
time
of
our
meeting
*NL*
drew
nigh
,
Ralph
called
on
me
first
,
and
let
me
know
his
piece
was
*NL*
ready
.
I
told
him
I
had
been
busy
,
and
,
having
little
inclination
,
had
*NL*
done
nothing
.
He
then
show
'd
me
his
piece
for
my
opinion
,
and
I
much
*NL*
approv
'd
it
,
as
it
appear
'd
to
me
to
have
great
merit
.
``
Now
,
''
says
he
,
*NL*
``
Osborne
never
will
allow
the
least
merit
in
any
thing
of
mine
,
but
*NL*
makes
1000
criticisms
out
of
mere
envy
.
He
is
not
so
jealous
of
you
;
I
*NL*
wish
,
therefore
,
you
would
take
this
piece
,
and
produce
it
as
yours
;
I
*NL*
will
pretend
not
to
have
had
time
,
and
so
produce
nothing
.
We
shall
*NL*
then
see
what
he
will
say
to
it
.
''
It
was
agreed
,
and
I
immediately
*NL*
transcrib
'd
it
,
that
it
might
appear
in
my
own
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
met
;
Watson
's
performance
was
read
;
there
were
some
beauties
in
it
,
*NL*
but
many
defects
.
Osborne
's
was
read
;
it
was
much
better
;
Ralph
did
it
*NL*
justice
;
remarked
some
faults
,
but
applauded
the
beauties
.
He
himself
*NL*
had
nothing
to
produce
.
I
was
backward
;
seemed
desirous
of
being
*NL*
excused
;
had
not
had
sufficient
time
to
correct
,
etc.
;
but
no
excuse
*NL*
could
be
admitted
;
produce
I
must
.
It
was
read
and
repeated
;
Watson
*NL*
and
Osborne
gave
up
the
contest
,
and
join
'd
in
applauding
it
.
Ralph
*NL*
only
made
some
criticisms
,
and
propos
'd
some
amendments
;
but
I
defended
*NL*
my
text
.
Osborne
was
against
Ralph
,
and
told
him
he
was
no
better
a
*NL*
critic
than
poet
,
so
he
dropt
the
argument
.
As
they
two
went
home
*NL*
together
,
Osborne
expressed
himself
still
more
strongly
in
favor
of
*NL*
what
he
thought
my
production
;
having
restrain
'd
himself
before
,
as
he
*NL*
said
,
lest
I
should
think
it
flattery
.
``
But
who
would
have
imagin
'd
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
that
Franklin
had
been
capable
of
such
a
performance
;
such
*NL*
painting
,
such
force
,
such
fire
!
He
has
even
improv
'd
the
original
.
*NL*
In
his
common
conversation
he
seems
to
have
no
choice
of
words
;
he
*NL*
hesitates
and
blunders
;
and
yet
,
good
God
!
how
he
writes
!
''
When
we
next
*NL*
met
,
Ralph
discovered
the
trick
we
had
plaid
him
,
and
Osborne
was
a
*NL*
little
laught
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
transaction
fixed
Ralph
in
his
resolution
of
becoming
a
poet
.
I
*NL*
did
all
I
could
to
dissuade
him
from
it
,
but
he
continued
scribbling
*NL*
verses
till
Pope
cured
him
.
He
became
,
however
,
a
pretty
good
prose
*NL*
writer
.
More
of
him
hereafter
.
But
,
as
I
may
not
have
occasion
again
*NL*
to
mention
the
other
two
,
I
shall
just
remark
here
,
that
Watson
died
in
*NL*
my
arms
a
few
years
after
,
much
lamented
,
being
the
best
of
our
set
.
*NL*
Osborne
went
to
the
West
Indies
,
where
he
became
an
eminent
lawyer
and
*NL*
made
money
,
but
died
young
.
He
and
I
had
made
a
serious
agreement
,
*NL*
that
the
one
who
happen
'd
first
to
die
should
,
if
possible
,
make
a
*NL*
friendly
visit
to
the
other
,
and
acquaint
him
how
he
found
things
in
*NL*
that
separate
state
.
But
he
never
fulfill
'd
his
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
governor
,
seeming
to
like
my
company
,
had
me
frequently
to
his
*NL*
house
,
and
his
setting
me
up
was
always
mention
'd
as
a
fixed
thing
.
I
*NL*
was
to
take
with
me
letters
recommendatory
to
a
number
of
his
friends
,
*NL*
besides
the
letter
of
credit
to
furnish
me
with
the
necessary
money
for
*NL*
purchasing
the
press
and
types
,
paper
,
etc.
.
For
these
letters
I
was
*NL*
appointed
to
call
at
different
times
,
when
they
were
to
be
ready
,
but
a
*NL*
future
time
was
still
named
.
Thus
he
went
on
till
the
ship
,
whose
*NL*
departure
too
had
been
several
times
postponed
,
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
sailing
.
Then
,
when
I
call
'd
to
take
my
leave
and
receive
the
letters
,
*NL*
his
secretary
,
Dr.
Bard
,
came
out
to
me
and
said
the
governor
was
*NL*
extremely
busy
in
writing
,
but
would
be
down
at
Newcastle
before
the
*NL*
ship
,
and
there
the
letters
would
be
delivered
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
,
though
married
,
and
having
one
child
,
had
determined
to
*NL*
accompany
me
in
this
voyage
.
It
was
thought
he
intended
to
establish
a
*NL*
correspondence
,
and
obtain
goods
to
sell
on
commission
;
but
I
found
*NL*
afterwards
,
that
,
thro
'
some
discontent
with
his
wife
's
relations
,
he
*NL*
purposed
to
leave
her
on
their
hands
,
and
never
return
again
.
Having
*NL*
taken
leave
of
my
friends
,
and
interchang
'd
some
promises
with
Miss
*NL*
Read
,
I
left
Philadelphia
in
the
ship
,
which
anchor
'd
at
Newcastle
.
*NL*
The
governor
was
there
;
but
when
I
went
to
his
lodging
,
the
secretary
*NL*
came
to
me
from
him
with
the
civillest
message
in
the
world
,
that
he
*NL*
could
not
then
see
me
,
being
engaged
in
business
of
the
utmost
*NL*
importance
,
but
should
send
the
letters
to
me
on
board
,
wish
'd
me
*NL*
heartily
a
good
voyage
and
a
speedy
return
,
etc.
.
I
returned
on
board
a
*NL*
little
puzzled
,
but
still
not
doubting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Andrew
Hamilton
,
a
famous
lawyer
of
Philadelphia
,
had
taken
passage
*NL*
in
the
same
ship
for
himself
and
son
,
and
with
Mr.
Denham
,
a
Quaker
*NL*
merchant
,
and
Messrs.
Onion
and
Russel
,
masters
of
an
iron
work
in
*NL*
Maryland
,
had
engag
'd
the
great
cabin
;
so
that
Ralph
and
I
were
forced
*NL*
to
take
up
with
a
berth
in
the
steerage
,
and
none
on
board
knowing
us
,
*NL*
were
considered
as
ordinary
persons
.
But
Mr.
Hamilton
and
his
son
-LRB-
it
*NL*
was
James
,
since
governor
-RRB-
return
'd
from
Newcastle
to
Philadelphia
,
the
*NL*
father
being
recall
'd
by
a
great
fee
to
plead
for
a
seized
ship
;
and
,
*NL*
just
before
we
sail
'd
,
Colonel
French
coming
on
board
,
and
showing
me
*NL*
great
respect
,
I
was
more
taken
notice
of
,
and
,
with
my
friend
Ralph
,
*NL*
invited
by
the
other
gentlemen
to
come
into
the
cabin
,
there
being
now
*NL*
room
.
Accordingly
,
we
remov
'd
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
Understanding
that
Colonel
French
had
brought
on
board
the
governor
's
*NL*
despatches
,
I
ask
'd
the
captain
for
those
letters
that
were
to
be
under
*NL*
my
care
.
He
said
all
were
put
into
the
bag
together
and
he
could
not
*NL*
then
come
at
them
;
but
,
before
we
landed
in
England
,
I
should
have
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
picking
them
out
;
so
I
was
satisfied
for
the
present
,
*NL*
and
we
proceeded
on
our
voyage
.
We
had
a
sociable
company
in
the
*NL*
cabin
,
and
lived
uncommonly
well
,
having
the
addition
of
all
Mr.
*NL*
Hamilton
's
stores
,
who
had
laid
in
plentifully
.
In
this
passage
Mr.
*NL*
Denham
contracted
a
friendship
for
me
that
continued
during
his
life
.
*NL*
The
voyage
was
otherwise
not
a
pleasant
one
,
as
we
had
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
bad
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
into
the
Channel
,
the
captain
kept
his
word
with
me
,
and
*NL*
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
examining
the
bag
for
the
governor
's
letters
.
*NL*
I
found
none
upon
which
my
name
was
put
as
under
my
care
.
I
picked
out
*NL*
six
or
seven
,
that
,
by
the
handwriting
,
I
thought
might
be
the
promised
*NL*
letters
,
especially
as
one
of
them
was
directed
to
Basket
,
the
king
's
*NL*
printer
,
and
another
to
some
stationer
.
We
arriv
'd
in
London
the
24th
*NL*
of
December
,
1724
.
I
waited
upon
the
stationer
,
who
came
first
in
my
*NL*
way
,
delivering
the
letter
as
from
Governor
Keith
.
``
I
do
n't
know
such
*NL*
a
person
,
''
says
he
;
but
,
opening
the
letter
,
``
O
!
this
is
from
*NL*
Riddlesden
.
I
have
lately
found
him
to
be
a
compleat
rascal
,
and
I
*NL*
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
,
nor
receive
any
letters
from
him
.
''
*NL*
So
,
putting
the
letter
into
my
hand
,
he
turn
'd
on
his
heel
and
left
me
*NL*
to
serve
some
customer
.
I
was
surprized
to
find
these
were
not
the
*NL*
governor
's
letters
;
and
,
after
recollecting
and
comparing
*NL*
circumstances
,
I
began
to
doubt
his
sincerity
.
I
found
my
friend
*NL*
Denham
,
and
opened
the
whole
affair
to
him
.
He
let
me
into
Keith
's
*NL*
character
;
told
me
there
was
not
the
least
probability
that
he
had
*NL*
written
any
letters
for
me
;
that
no
one
,
who
knew
him
,
had
the
smallest
*NL*
dependence
on
him
;
and
he
laught
at
the
notion
of
the
governor
's
giving
*NL*
me
a
letter
of
credit
,
having
,
as
he
said
,
no
credit
to
give
.
On
my
*NL*
expressing
some
concern
about
what
I
should
do
,
he
advised
me
to
*NL*
endeavor
getting
some
employment
in
the
way
of
my
business
.
``
Among
the
*NL*
printers
here
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
will
improve
yourself
,
and
when
you
*NL*
return
to
America
,
you
will
set
up
to
greater
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
both
of
us
happen
'd
to
know
,
as
well
as
the
stationer
,
that
*NL*
Riddlesden
,
the
attorney
,
was
a
very
knave
.
He
had
half
ruin
'd
Miss
*NL*
Read
's
father
by
persuading
him
to
be
bound
for
him
.
By
this
letter
it
*NL*
appear
'd
there
was
a
secret
scheme
on
foot
to
the
prejudice
of
Hamilton
*NL*
-LRB-
suppos
'd
to
be
then
coming
over
with
us
-RRB-
;
and
that
Keith
was
concerned
*NL*
in
it
with
Riddlesden
.
Denham
,
who
was
a
friend
of
Hamilton
's
thought
*NL*
he
ought
to
be
acquainted
with
it
;
so
,
when
he
arriv
'd
in
England
,
*NL*
which
was
soon
after
,
partly
from
resentment
and
ill-will
to
Keith
and
*NL*
Riddlesden
,
and
partly
from
good-will
to
him
,
I
waited
on
him
,
and
gave
*NL*
him
the
letter
.
He
thank
'd
me
cordially
,
the
information
being
of
*NL*
importance
to
him
;
and
from
that
time
he
became
my
friend
,
greatly
to
*NL*
my
advantage
afterwards
on
many
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
shall
we
think
of
a
governor
's
playing
such
pitiful
tricks
,
*NL*
and
imposing
so
grossly
on
a
poor
ignorant
boy
!
It
was
a
habit
he
had
*NL*
acquired
.
He
wish
'd
to
please
everybody
;
and
,
having
little
to
give
,
*NL*
he
gave
expectations
.
He
was
otherwise
an
ingenious
,
sensible
man
,
a
*NL*
pretty
good
writer
,
and
a
good
governor
for
the
people
,
tho
'
not
for
*NL*
his
constituents
,
the
proprietaries
,
whose
instructions
he
sometimes
*NL*
disregarded
.
Several
of
our
best
laws
were
of
his
planning
and
passed
*NL*
during
his
administration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ralph
and
I
were
inseparable
companions
.
We
took
lodgings
together
in
*NL*
Little
Britain
at
three
shillings
and
sixpence
a
week
--
as
much
as
we
*NL*
could
then
afford
.
He
found
some
relations
,
but
they
were
poor
,
and
*NL*
unable
to
assist
him
.
He
now
let
me
know
his
intentions
of
remaining
*NL*
in
London
,
and
that
he
never
meant
to
return
to
Philadelphia
.
He
had
*NL*
brought
no
money
with
him
,
the
whole
he
could
muster
having
been
*NL*
expended
in
paying
his
passage
.
I
had
fifteen
pistoles
;
so
he
borrowed
*NL*
occasionally
of
me
to
subsist
,
while
he
was
looking
out
for
business
.
*NL*
He
first
endeavored
to
get
into
the
playhouse
,
believing
himself
*NL*
qualify
'd
for
an
actor
;
but
Wilkes
,
to
whom
he
apply
'd
,
advis
'd
him
*NL*
candidly
not
to
think
of
that
employment
,
as
it
was
impossible
he
*NL*
should
succeed
in
it
.
Then
he
propos
'd
to
Roberts
,
a
publisher
in
*NL*
Paternoster
Row
,
to
write
for
him
a
weekly
paper
like
the
Spectator
,
on
*NL*
certain
conditions
,
which
Roberts
did
not
approve
.
Then
he
endeavored
*NL*
to
get
employment
as
a
hackney
writer
,
to
copy
for
the
stationers
and
*NL*
lawyers
about
the
Temple
,
but
could
find
no
vacancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
immediately
got
into
work
at
Palmer
's
,
then
a
famous
printing-house
*NL*
in
Bartholomew
Close
,
and
here
I
continu
'd
near
a
year
.
I
was
pretty
*NL*
diligent
,
but
spent
with
Ralph
a
good
deal
of
my
earnings
in
going
to
*NL*
plays
and
other
places
of
amusement
.
We
had
together
consumed
all
my
*NL*
pistoles
,
and
now
just
rubbed
on
from
hand
to
mouth
.
He
seem
'd
quite
*NL*
to
forget
his
wife
and
child
,
and
I
,
by
degrees
,
my
engagements
with
*NL*
Miss
Read
,
to
whom
I
never
wrote
more
than
one
letter
,
and
that
was
to
*NL*
let
her
know
I
was
not
likely
soon
to
return
.
This
was
another
of
the
*NL*
great
errata
of
my
life
,
which
I
should
wish
to
correct
if
I
were
to
*NL*
live
it
over
again
.
In
fact
,
by
our
expenses
,
I
was
constantly
kept
*NL*
unable
to
pay
my
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Palmer
's
I
was
employed
in
composing
for
the
second
edition
of
*NL*
Wollaston
's
``
Religion
of
Nature
.
''
Some
of
his
reasonings
not
appearing
*NL*
to
me
well
founded
,
I
wrote
a
little
metaphysical
piece
in
which
I
made
*NL*
remarks
on
them
.
It
was
entitled
``
A
Dissertation
on
Liberty
and
*NL*
Necessity
,
Pleasure
and
Pain
.
''
I
inscribed
it
to
my
friend
Ralph
;
I
*NL*
printed
a
small
number
.
It
occasion
'd
my
being
more
consider
'd
by
Mr.
*NL*
Palmer
as
a
young
man
of
some
ingenuity
,
tho
'
he
seriously
expostulated
*NL*
with
me
upon
the
principles
of
my
pamphlet
,
which
to
him
appear
'd
*NL*
abominable
.
My
printing
this
pamphlet
was
another
erratum
.
While
I
*NL*
lodg
'd
in
Little
Britain
,
I
made
an
acquaintance
with
one
Wilcox
,
a
*NL*
bookseller
,
whose
shop
was
at
the
next
door
.
He
had
an
immense
*NL*
collection
of
second-hand
books
.
Circulating
libraries
were
not
then
*NL*
in
use
;
but
we
agreed
that
,
on
certain
reasonable
terms
,
which
I
have
*NL*
now
forgotten
,
I
might
take
,
read
,
and
return
any
of
his
books
.
This
I
*NL*
esteem
'd
a
great
advantage
,
and
I
made
as
much
use
of
it
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
pamphlet
by
some
means
falling
into
the
hands
of
one
Lyons
,
a
*NL*
surgeon
,
author
of
a
book
entitled
``
The
Infallibility
of
Human
*NL*
Judgment
,
''
it
occasioned
an
acquaintance
between
us
.
He
took
great
*NL*
notice
of
me
,
called
on
me
often
to
converse
on
those
subjects
,
carried
*NL*
me
to
the
Horns
,
a
pale
alehouse
in
--
Lane
,
Cheapside
,
and
*NL*
introduced
me
to
Dr.
Mandeville
,
author
of
the
``
Fable
of
the
Bees
,
''
who
*NL*
had
a
club
there
,
of
which
he
was
the
soul
,
being
a
most
facetious
,
*NL*
entertaining
companion
.
Lyons
,
too
,
introduced
me
to
Dr.
Pemberton
,
at
*NL*
Batson
's
Coffee-house
,
who
promis
'd
to
give
me
an
opportunity
,
some
*NL*
time
or
other
,
of
seeing
Sir
Isaac
Newton
,
of
which
I
was
extreamely
*NL*
desirous
;
but
this
never
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
brought
over
a
few
curiosities
,
among
which
the
principal
was
a
*NL*
purse
made
of
the
asbestos
,
which
purifies
by
fire
.
Sir
Hans
Sloane
*NL*
heard
of
it
,
came
to
see
me
,
and
invited
me
to
his
house
in
Bloomsbury
*NL*
Square
,
where
he
show
'd
me
all
his
curiosities
,
and
persuaded
me
to
let
*NL*
him
add
that
to
the
number
,
for
which
he
paid
me
handsomely
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
our
house
there
lodg
'd
a
young
woman
,
a
milliner
,
who
,
I
think
,
had
*NL*
a
shop
in
the
Cloisters
.
She
had
been
genteelly
bred
,
was
sensible
and
*NL*
lively
,
and
of
most
pleasing
conversation
.
Ralph
read
plays
to
her
in
*NL*
the
evenings
,
they
grew
intimate
,
she
took
another
lodging
,
and
he
*NL*
followed
her
.
They
liv
'd
together
some
time
;
but
,
he
being
still
out
*NL*
of
business
,
and
her
income
not
sufficient
to
maintain
them
with
her
*NL*
child
,
he
took
a
resolution
of
going
from
London
,
to
try
for
a
country
*NL*
school
,
which
he
thought
himself
well
qualified
to
undertake
,
as
he
*NL*
wrote
an
excellent
hand
,
and
was
a
master
of
arithmetic
and
accounts
.
*NL*
This
,
however
,
he
deemed
a
business
below
him
,
and
confident
of
future
*NL*
better
fortune
,
when
he
should
be
unwilling
to
have
it
known
that
he
*NL*
once
was
so
meanly
employed
,
he
changed
his
name
,
and
did
me
the
honor
*NL*
to
assume
mine
;
for
I
soon
after
had
a
letter
from
him
,
acquainting
me
*NL*
that
he
was
settled
in
a
small
village
-LRB-
in
Berkshire
,
I
think
it
was
,
*NL*
where
he
taught
reading
and
writing
to
ten
or
a
dozen
boys
,
at
sixpence
*NL*
each
per
week
-RRB-
,
recommending
Mrs.
T
--
to
my
care
,
and
desiring
me
to
*NL*
write
to
him
,
directing
for
Mr.
Franklin
,
schoolmaster
,
at
such
a
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
write
frequently
,
sending
me
large
specimens
of
an
epic
*NL*
poem
which
he
was
then
composing
,
and
desiring
my
remarks
and
*NL*
corrections
.
These
I
gave
him
from
time
to
time
,
but
endeavor
'd
rather
*NL*
to
discourage
his
proceeding
.
One
of
Young
's
Satires
was
then
just
*NL*
published
.
I
copy
'd
and
sent
him
a
great
part
of
it
,
which
set
in
a
*NL*
strong
light
the
folly
of
pursuing
the
Muses
with
any
hope
of
*NL*
advancement
by
them
.
All
was
in
vain
;
sheets
of
the
poem
continued
to
*NL*
come
by
every
post
.
In
the
mean
time
,
Mrs.
T
--
,
having
on
his
*NL*
account
lost
her
friends
and
business
,
was
often
in
distresses
,
and
*NL*
us
'd
to
send
for
me
,
and
borrow
what
I
could
spare
to
help
her
out
of
*NL*
them
.
I
grew
fond
of
her
company
,
and
,
being
at
that
time
under
no
*NL*
religious
restraint
,
and
presuming
upon
my
importance
to
her
,
I
*NL*
attempted
familiarities
-LRB-
another
erratum
-RRB-
which
she
repuls
'd
with
a
*NL*
proper
resentment
,
and
acquainted
him
with
my
behaviour
.
This
made
a
*NL*
breach
between
us
;
and
,
when
he
returned
again
to
London
,
he
let
me
*NL*
know
he
thought
I
had
cancell
'd
all
the
obligations
he
had
been
under
*NL*
to
me
.
So
I
found
I
was
never
to
expect
his
repaying
me
what
I
lent
to
*NL*
him
,
or
advanc
'd
for
him
.
This
,
however
,
was
not
then
of
much
*NL*
consequence
,
as
he
was
totally
unable
;
and
in
the
loss
of
his
*NL*
friendship
I
found
myself
relieved
from
a
burthen
.
I
now
began
to
*NL*
think
of
getting
a
little
money
beforehand
,
and
,
expecting
better
work
,
*NL*
I
left
Palmer
's
to
work
at
Watts
's
,
near
Lincoln
's
Inn
Fields
,
a
still
*NL*
greater
printing-house
.
Here
I
continued
all
the
rest
of
my
stay
in
*NL*
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
my
first
admission
into
this
printing-house
I
took
to
working
at
*NL*
press
,
imagining
I
felt
a
want
of
the
bodily
exercise
I
had
been
us
'd
*NL*
to
in
America
,
where
presswork
is
mix
'd
with
composing
.
I
drank
only
*NL*
water
;
the
other
workmen
,
near
fifty
in
number
,
were
great
guzzlers
of
*NL*
beer
.
On
occasion
,
I
carried
up
and
down
stairs
a
large
form
of
types
*NL*
in
each
hand
,
when
others
carried
but
one
in
both
hands
.
They
wondered
*NL*
to
see
,
from
this
and
several
instances
,
that
the
Water-American
,
as
*NL*
they
called
me
,
was
stronger
than
themselves
,
who
drank
strong
beer
!
*NL*
We
had
an
alehouse
boy
who
attended
always
in
the
house
to
supply
the
*NL*
workmen
.
My
companion
at
the
press
drank
every
day
a
pint
before
*NL*
breakfast
,
a
pint
at
breakfast
with
his
bread
and
cheese
,
a
pint
*NL*
between
breakfast
and
dinner
,
a
pint
at
dinner
,
a
pint
in
the
afternoon
*NL*
about
six
o'clock
,
and
another
when
he
had
done
his
day
's
work
.
I
*NL*
thought
it
a
detestable
custom
;
but
it
was
necessary
,
he
suppos
'd
,
to
*NL*
drink
strong
beer
,
that
he
might
be
strong
to
labor
.
I
endeavored
to
*NL*
convince
him
that
the
bodily
strength
afforded
by
beer
could
only
be
in
*NL*
proportion
to
the
grain
or
flour
of
the
barley
dissolved
in
the
water
*NL*
of
which
it
was
made
;
that
there
was
more
flour
in
a
pennyworth
of
*NL*
bread
;
and
therefore
,
if
he
would
eat
that
with
a
pint
of
water
,
it
*NL*
would
give
him
more
strength
than
a
quart
of
beer
.
He
drank
on
,
*NL*
however
,
and
had
four
or
five
shillings
to
pay
out
of
his
wages
every
*NL*
Saturday
night
for
that
muddling
liquor
;
an
expense
I
was
free
from
.
*NL*
And
thus
these
poor
devils
keep
themselves
always
under
.
*NL*
*NL*
Watts
,
after
some
weeks
,
desiring
to
have
me
in
the
composing-room
,
I
*NL*
left
the
pressmen
;
a
new
bien
venu
or
sum
for
drink
,
being
five
*NL*
shillings
,
was
demanded
of
me
by
the
compositors
.
I
thought
it
an
*NL*
imposition
,
as
I
had
paid
below
;
the
master
thought
so
too
,
and
forbad
*NL*
my
paying
it
.
I
stood
out
two
or
three
weeks
,
was
accordingly
*NL*
considered
as
an
excommunicate
,
and
had
so
many
little
pieces
of
*NL*
private
mischief
done
me
,
by
mixing
my
sorts
,
transposing
my
pages
,
*NL*
breaking
my
matter
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
if
I
were
ever
so
little
out
of
the
*NL*
room
,
and
all
ascribed
to
the
chappel
ghost
,
which
they
said
ever
*NL*
haunted
those
not
regularly
admitted
,
that
,
notwithstanding
the
*NL*
master
's
protection
,
I
found
myself
oblig
'd
to
comply
and
pay
the
*NL*
money
,
convinc
'd
of
the
folly
of
being
on
ill
terms
with
those
one
is
*NL*
to
live
with
continually
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
on
a
fair
footing
with
them
,
and
soon
acquir
'd
considerable
*NL*
influence
.
I
propos
'd
some
reasonable
alterations
in
their
chappel
-LSB-
4
-RSB-
*NL*
laws
,
and
carried
them
against
all
opposition
.
From
my
example
,
a
*NL*
great
part
of
them
left
their
muddling
breakfast
of
beer
,
and
bread
,
*NL*
and
cheese
,
finding
they
could
with
me
be
suppli
'd
from
a
neighboring
*NL*
house
with
a
large
porringer
of
hot
water-gruel
,
sprinkled
with
pepper
,
*NL*
crumbl
'd
with
bread
,
and
a
bit
of
butter
in
it
,
for
the
price
of
a
pint
*NL*
of
beer
,
viz.
,
three
half-pence
.
This
was
a
more
comfortable
as
well
as
*NL*
cheaper
breakfast
,
and
kept
their
heads
clearer
.
Those
who
continued
*NL*
sotting
with
beer
all
day
,
were
often
,
by
not
paying
,
out
of
credit
at
*NL*
the
alehouse
,
and
us
'd
to
make
interest
with
me
to
get
beer
;
their
*NL*
light
,
as
they
phrased
it
,
being
out
.
I
watch
'd
the
pay-table
on
*NL*
Saturday
night
,
and
collected
what
I
stood
engag
'd
for
them
,
having
to
*NL*
pay
sometimes
near
thirty
shillings
a
week
on
their
account
.
This
,
and
*NL*
my
being
esteem
'd
a
pretty
good
riggite
,
that
is
,
a
jocular
verbal
*NL*
satirist
,
supported
my
consequence
in
the
society
.
My
constant
*NL*
attendance
-LRB-
I
never
making
a
St.
Monday
-RRB-
recommended
me
to
the
master
;
*NL*
and
my
uncommon
quickness
at
composing
occasioned
my
being
put
upon
all
*NL*
work
of
dispatch
,
which
was
generally
better
paid
.
So
I
went
on
now
*NL*
very
agreeably
.

My
lodging
in
Little
Britain
being
too
remote
,
I
found
another
in
*NL*
Duke-street
,
opposite
to
the
Romish
Chapel
.
It
was
two
pair
of
stairs
*NL*
backwards
,
at
an
Italian
warehouse
.
A
widow
lady
kept
the
house
;
she
*NL*
had
a
daughter
,
and
a
maid
servant
,
and
a
journeyman
who
attended
the
*NL*
warehouse
,
but
lodg
'd
abroad
.
After
sending
to
inquire
my
character
at
*NL*
the
house
where
I
last
lodg
'd
she
agreed
to
take
me
in
at
the
same
*NL*
rate
,
3s
.
6d
.
per
week
;
cheaper
,
as
she
said
,
from
the
protection
she
*NL*
expected
in
having
a
man
lodge
in
the
house
.
She
was
a
widow
,
an
*NL*
elderly
woman
;
had
been
bred
a
Protestant
,
being
a
clergyman
's
*NL*
daughter
,
but
was
converted
to
the
Catholic
religion
by
her
husband
,
*NL*
whose
memory
she
much
revered
;
had
lived
much
among
people
of
*NL*
distinction
,
and
knew
a
thousand
anecdotes
of
them
as
far
back
as
the
*NL*
times
of
Charles
the
Second
.
She
was
lame
in
her
knees
with
the
gout
,
*NL*
and
,
therefore
,
seldom
stirred
out
of
her
room
,
so
sometimes
wanted
*NL*
company
;
and
hers
was
so
highly
amusing
to
me
,
that
I
was
sure
to
spend
*NL*
an
evening
with
her
whenever
she
desired
it
.
Our
supper
was
only
half
*NL*
an
anchovy
each
,
on
a
very
little
strip
of
bread
and
butter
,
and
half
a
*NL*
pint
of
ale
between
us
;
but
the
entertainment
was
in
her
conversation
.
*NL*
My
always
keeping
good
hours
,
and
giving
little
trouble
in
the
family
,
*NL*
made
her
unwilling
to
part
with
me
;
so
that
,
when
I
talk
'd
of
a
lodging
*NL*
I
had
heard
of
,
nearer
my
business
,
for
two
shillings
a
week
,
which
,
*NL*
intent
as
I
now
was
on
saving
money
,
made
some
difference
,
she
bid
me
*NL*
not
think
of
it
,
for
she
would
abate
me
two
shillings
a
week
for
the
*NL*
future
;
so
I
remained
with
her
at
one
shilling
and
sixpence
as
long
as
*NL*
I
staid
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
garret
of
her
house
there
lived
a
maiden
lady
of
seventy
,
in
the
*NL*
most
retired
manner
,
of
whom
my
landlady
gave
me
this
account
:
that
she
*NL*
was
a
Roman
Catholic
,
had
been
sent
abroad
when
young
,
and
lodg
'd
in
a
*NL*
nunnery
with
an
intent
of
becoming
a
nun
;
but
,
the
country
not
agreeing
*NL*
with
her
,
she
returned
to
England
,
where
,
there
being
no
nunnery
,
she
*NL*
had
vow
'd
to
lead
the
life
of
a
nun
,
as
near
as
might
be
done
in
those
*NL*
circumstances
.
Accordingly
,
she
had
given
all
her
estate
to
charitable
*NL*
uses
,
reserving
only
twelve
pounds
a
year
to
live
on
,
and
out
of
this
*NL*
sum
she
still
gave
a
great
deal
in
charity
,
living
herself
on
*NL*
water-gruel
only
,
and
using
no
fire
but
to
boil
it
.
She
had
lived
many
*NL*
years
in
that
garret
,
being
permitted
to
remain
there
gratis
by
*NL*
successive
Catholic
tenants
of
the
house
below
,
as
they
deemed
it
a
*NL*
blessing
to
have
her
there
.
A
priest
visited
her
to
confess
her
every
*NL*
day
.
``
I
have
ask
'd
her
,
''
says
my
landlady
,
``
how
she
,
as
she
liv
'd
,
*NL*
could
possibly
find
so
much
employment
for
a
confessor
?
''
``
Oh
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
vain
thoughts
.
''
I
was
permitted
once
*NL*
to
visit
her
,
She
was
chearful
and
polite
,
and
convers
'd
pleasantly
.
*NL*
The
room
was
clean
,
but
had
no
other
furniture
than
a
matras
,
a
table
*NL*
with
a
crucifix
and
book
,
a
stool
which
she
gave
me
to
sit
on
,
and
a
*NL*
picture
over
the
chimney
of
Saint
Veronica
displaying
her
handkerchief
,
*NL*
with
the
miraculous
figure
of
Christ
's
bleeding
face
on
it
,
which
she
*NL*
explained
to
me
with
great
seriousness
.
She
look
'd
pale
,
but
was
never
*NL*
sick
;
and
I
give
it
as
another
instance
on
how
small
an
income
life
and
*NL*
health
may
be
supported
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Watts
's
printing-house
I
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
an
*NL*
ingenious
young
man
,
one
Wygate
,
who
,
having
wealthy
relations
,
had
*NL*
been
better
educated
than
most
printers
;
was
a
tolerable
Latinist
,
*NL*
spoke
French
,
and
lov
'd
reading
.
I
taught
him
and
a
friend
of
his
to
*NL*
swim
at
twice
going
into
the
river
,
and
they
soon
became
good
swimmers
.
*NL*
They
introduc
'd
me
to
some
gentlemen
from
the
country
,
who
went
to
*NL*
Chelsea
by
water
to
see
the
College
and
Don
Saltero
's
curiosities
.
In
*NL*
our
return
,
at
the
request
of
the
company
,
whose
curiosity
Wygate
had
*NL*
excited
,
I
stripped
and
leaped
into
the
river
,
and
swam
from
near
*NL*
Chelsea
to
Blackfryar
's
,
performing
on
the
way
many
feats
of
activity
,
*NL*
both
upon
and
under
water
,
that
surpris
'd
and
pleas
'd
those
to
whom
*NL*
they
were
novelties
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
from
a
child
been
ever
delighted
with
this
exercise
,
had
studied
*NL*
and
practis
'd
all
Thevenot
's
motions
and
positions
,
added
some
of
my
*NL*
own
,
aiming
at
the
graceful
and
easy
as
well
as
the
useful
.
All
these
*NL*
I
took
this
occasion
of
exhibiting
to
the
company
,
and
was
much
*NL*
flatter
'd
by
their
admiration
;
and
Wygate
,
who
was
desirous
of
becoming
*NL*
a
master
,
grew
more
and
more
attach
'd
to
me
on
that
account
,
as
well
as
*NL*
from
the
similarity
of
our
studies
.
He
at
length
proposed
to
me
*NL*
travelling
all
over
Europe
together
,
supporting
ourselves
everywhere
by
*NL*
working
at
our
business
.
I
was
once
inclined
to
it
;
but
,
mentioning
it
*NL*
to
my
good
friend
Mr.
Denham
,
with
whom
I
often
spent
an
hour
when
I
*NL*
had
leisure
,
he
dissuaded
me
from
it
,
advising
me
to
think
only
of
*NL*
returning
to
Pennsilvania
,
which
he
was
now
about
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
record
one
trait
of
this
good
man
's
character
.
He
had
formerly
*NL*
been
in
business
at
Bristol
,
but
failed
in
debt
to
a
number
of
people
,
*NL*
compounded
and
went
to
America
.
There
,
by
a
close
application
to
*NL*
business
as
a
merchant
,
he
acquir
'd
a
plentiful
fortune
in
a
few
years
.
*NL*
Returning
to
England
in
the
ship
with
me
,
he
invited
his
old
creditors
*NL*
to
an
entertainment
,
at
which
he
thank
'd
them
for
the
easy
composition
*NL*
they
had
favored
him
with
,
and
,
when
they
expected
nothing
but
the
*NL*
treat
,
every
man
at
the
first
remove
found
under
his
plate
an
order
on
*NL*
a
banker
for
the
full
amount
of
the
unpaid
remainder
with
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
told
me
he
was
about
to
return
to
Philadelphia
,
and
should
carry
*NL*
over
a
great
quantity
of
goods
in
order
to
open
a
store
there
.
He
*NL*
propos
'd
to
take
me
over
as
his
clerk
,
to
keep
his
books
,
in
which
he
*NL*
would
instruct
me
,
copy
his
letters
,
and
attend
the
store
.
He
added
*NL*
that
,
as
soon
as
I
should
be
acquainted
with
mercantile
business
,
he
*NL*
would
promote
me
by
sending
me
with
a
cargo
of
flour
and
bread
,
etc.
,
*NL*
to
the
West
Indies
,
and
procure
me
commissions
from
others
which
would
*NL*
be
profitable
;
and
,
if
I
manag
'd
well
,
would
establish
me
handsomely
.
*NL*
The
thing
pleas
'd
me
;
for
I
was
grown
tired
of
London
,
remembered
with
*NL*
pleasure
the
happy
months
I
had
spent
in
Pennsylvania
,
and
wish
'd
again
*NL*
to
see
it
;
therefore
I
immediately
agreed
on
the
terms
of
fifty
pounds
*NL*
a
year
,
Pennsylvania
money
;
less
,
indeed
,
than
my
present
gettings
as
a
*NL*
compositor
,
but
affording
a
better
prospect
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
took
leave
of
printing
,
as
I
thought
,
for
ever
,
and
was
daily
*NL*
employed
in
my
new
business
,
going
about
with
Mr.
Denham
among
the
*NL*
tradesmen
to
purchase
various
articles
,
and
seeing
them
pack
'd
up
,
*NL*
doing
errands
,
calling
upon
workmen
to
dispatch
,
etc.
;
and
,
when
all
*NL*
was
on
board
,
I
had
a
few
days
'
leisure
.
On
one
of
these
days
,
I
was
,
*NL*
to
my
surprise
,
sent
for
by
a
great
man
I
knew
only
by
name
,
a
Sir
*NL*
William
Wyndham
,
and
I
waited
upon
him
.
He
had
heard
by
some
means
or
*NL*
other
of
my
swimming
from
Chelsea
to
Blackfriar
's
,
and
of
my
teaching
*NL*
Wygate
and
another
young
man
to
swim
in
a
few
hours
.
He
had
two
sons
,
*NL*
about
to
set
out
on
their
travels
;
he
wish
'd
to
have
them
first
taught
*NL*
swimming
,
and
proposed
to
gratify
me
handsomely
if
I
would
teach
them
.
*NL*
They
were
not
yet
come
to
town
,
and
my
stay
was
uncertain
,
so
I
could
*NL*
not
undertake
it
;
but
,
from
this
incident
,
I
thought
it
likely
that
,
if
*NL*
I
were
to
remain
in
England
and
open
a
swimming-school
,
I
might
get
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
money
;
and
it
struck
me
so
strongly
,
that
,
had
the
*NL*
overture
been
sooner
made
me
,
probably
I
should
not
so
soon
have
*NL*
returned
to
America
.
After
many
years
,
you
and
I
had
something
of
more
*NL*
importance
to
do
with
one
of
these
sons
of
Sir
William
Wyndham
,
become
*NL*
Earl
of
Egremont
,
which
I
shall
mention
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
spent
about
eighteen
months
in
London
;
most
part
of
the
time
I
*NL*
work
'd
hard
at
my
business
,
and
spent
but
little
upon
myself
except
in
*NL*
seeing
plays
and
in
books
.
My
friend
Ralph
had
kept
me
poor
;
he
owed
*NL*
me
about
twenty-seven
pounds
,
which
I
was
now
never
likely
to
receive
;
*NL*
a
great
sum
out
of
my
small
earnings
!
I
lov
'd
him
,
notwithstanding
,
*NL*
for
he
had
many
amiable
qualities
.
I
had
by
no
means
improv
'd
my
*NL*
fortune
;
but
I
had
picked
up
some
very
ingenious
acquaintance
,
whose
*NL*
conversation
was
of
great
advantage
to
me
;
and
I
had
read
considerably
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sail
'd
from
Gravesend
on
the
23d
of
July
,
1726
.
For
the
incidents
*NL*
of
the
voyage
,
I
refer
you
to
my
journal
,
where
you
will
find
them
all
*NL*
minutely
related
.
Perhaps
the
most
important
part
of
that
journal
is
*NL*
the
plan
-LSB-
5
-RSB-
to
be
found
in
it
,
which
I
formed
at
sea
,
for
regulating
my
*NL*
future
conduct
in
life
.
It
is
the
more
remarkable
,
as
being
formed
*NL*
when
I
was
so
young
,
and
yet
being
pretty
faithfully
adhered
to
quite
*NL*
thro
'
to
old
age
.

The
``
Journal
''
was
printed
by
Sparks
,
from
a
copy
made
*NL*
at
Reading
in
1787
.
But
it
does
not
contain
the
Plan

*NL*
*NL*
We
landed
in
Philadelphia
on
the
11th
of
October
,
where
I
found
sundry
*NL*
alterations
.
Keith
was
no
longer
governor
,
being
superseded
by
Major
*NL*
Gordon
.
I
met
him
walking
the
streets
as
a
common
citizen
.
He
seem
'd
*NL*
a
little
asham
'd
at
seeing
me
,
but
pass
'd
without
saying
anything
.
I
*NL*
should
have
been
as
much
asham
'd
at
seeing
Miss
Read
,
had
not
her
*NL*
friends
,
despairing
with
reason
of
my
return
after
the
receipt
of
my
*NL*
letter
,
persuaded
her
to
marry
another
,
one
Rogers
,
a
potter
,
which
was
*NL*
done
in
my
absence
.
With
him
,
however
,
she
was
never
happy
,
and
soon
*NL*
parted
from
him
,
refusing
to
cohabit
with
him
or
bear
his
name
,
it
*NL*
being
now
said
that
he
had
another
wife
.
He
was
a
worthless
fellow
,
*NL*
tho
'
an
excellent
workman
,
which
was
the
temptation
to
her
friends
.
He
*NL*
got
into
debt
,
ran
away
in
1727
or
1728
,
went
to
the
West
Indies
,
and
*NL*
died
there
.
Keimer
had
got
a
better
house
,
a
shop
well
supply
'd
with
*NL*
stationery
,
plenty
of
new
types
,
a
number
of
hands
,
tho
'
none
good
,
and
*NL*
seem
'd
to
have
a
great
deal
of
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Denham
took
a
store
in
Water-street
,
where
we
open
'd
our
goods
;
I
*NL*
attended
the
business
diligently
,
studied
accounts
,
and
grew
,
in
a
*NL*
little
time
,
expert
at
selling
.
We
lodg
'd
and
,
boarded
together
;
he
*NL*
counsell
'd
me
as
a
father
,
having
a
sincere
regard
for
me
.
I
respected
*NL*
and
lov
'd
him
,
and
we
might
have
gone
on
together
very
happy
;
but
,
in
*NL*
the
beginning
of
February
,
1726-7
,
when
I
had
just
pass
'd
my
*NL*
twenty-first
year
,
we
both
were
taken
ill
.
My
distemper
was
a
*NL*
pleurisy
,
which
very
nearly
carried
me
off
.
I
suffered
a
good
deal
,
*NL*
gave
up
the
point
in
my
own
mind
,
and
was
rather
disappointed
when
I
*NL*
found
myself
recovering
,
regretting
,
in
some
degree
,
that
I
must
now
,
*NL*
some
time
or
other
,
have
all
that
disagreeable
work
to
do
over
again
.
*NL*
I
forget
what
his
distemper
was
;
it
held
him
a
long
time
,
and
at
length
*NL*
carried
him
off
.
He
left
me
a
small
legacy
in
a
nuncupative
will
,
as
a
*NL*
token
of
his
kindness
for
me
,
and
he
left
me
once
more
to
the
wide
*NL*
world
;
for
the
store
was
taken
into
the
care
of
his
executors
,
and
my
*NL*
employment
under
him
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
brother-in-law
,
Holmes
,
being
now
at
Philadelphia
,
advised
my
return
*NL*
to
my
business
;
and
Keimer
tempted
me
,
with
an
offer
of
large
wages
by
*NL*
the
year
,
to
come
and
take
the
management
of
his
printing-house
,
that
*NL*
he
might
better
attend
his
stationer
's
shop
.
I
had
heard
a
bad
*NL*
character
of
him
in
London
from
his
wife
and
her
friends
,
and
was
not
*NL*
fond
of
having
any
more
to
do
with
him
.
I
tri
'd
for
farther
employment
*NL*
as
a
merchant
's
clerk
;
but
,
not
readily
meeting
with
any
,
I
clos
'd
*NL*
again
with
Keimer
.
I
found
in
his
house
these
hands
:
Hugh
Meredith
,
a
*NL*
Welsh
Pensilvanian
,
thirty
years
of
age
,
bred
to
country
work
;
honest
,
*NL*
sensible
,
had
a
great
deal
of
solid
observation
,
was
something
of
a
*NL*
reader
,
but
given
to
drink
.
Stephen
Potts
,
a
young
countryman
of
full
*NL*
age
,
bred
to
the
same
,
of
uncommon
natural
parts
,
and
great
wit
and
*NL*
humor
,
but
a
little
idle
.
These
he
had
agreed
with
at
extream
low
*NL*
wages
per
week
,
to
be
rais
'd
a
shilling
every
three
months
,
as
they
*NL*
would
deserve
by
improving
in
their
business
;
and
the
expectation
of
*NL*
these
high
wages
,
to
come
on
hereafter
,
was
what
he
had
drawn
them
in
*NL*
with
.
Meredith
was
to
work
at
press
,
Potts
at
book-binding
,
which
he
,
*NL*
by
agreement
,
was
to
teach
them
,
though
he
knew
neither
one
nor
*NL*
t
`
other
.
John
--
,
a
wild
Irishman
,
brought
up
to
no
business
,
whose
*NL*
service
,
for
four
years
,
Keimer
had
purchased
from
the
captain
of
a
*NL*
ship
;
he
,
too
,
was
to
be
made
a
pressman
.
George
Webb
,
an
Oxford
*NL*
scholar
,
whose
time
for
four
years
he
had
likewise
bought
,
intending
*NL*
him
for
a
compositor
,
of
whom
more
presently
;
and
David
Harry
,
a
*NL*
country
boy
,
whom
he
had
taken
apprentice
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
perceiv
'd
that
the
intention
of
engaging
me
at
wages
so
much
*NL*
higher
than
he
had
been
us
'd
to
give
,
was
,
to
have
these
raw
,
cheap
*NL*
hands
form
'd
thro
'
me
;
and
,
as
soon
as
I
had
instructed
them
,
then
they
*NL*
being
all
articled
to
him
,
he
should
be
able
to
do
without
me
.
I
went
*NL*
on
,
however
,
very
cheerfully
,
put
his
printing-house
in
order
,
which
*NL*
had
been
in
great
confusion
,
and
brought
his
hands
by
degrees
to
mind
*NL*
their
business
and
to
do
it
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
odd
thing
to
find
an
Oxford
scholar
in
the
situation
of
a
*NL*
bought
servant
.
He
was
not
more
than
eighteen
years
of
age
,
and
gave
*NL*
me
this
account
of
himself
;
that
he
was
born
in
Gloucester
,
educated
at
*NL*
a
grammar-school
there
,
had
been
distinguish
'd
among
the
scholars
for
*NL*
some
apparent
superiority
in
performing
his
part
,
when
they
exhibited
*NL*
plays
;
belong
'd
to
the
Witty
Club
there
,
and
had
written
some
pieces
in
*NL*
prose
and
verse
,
which
were
printed
in
the
Gloucester
newspapers
;
*NL*
thence
he
was
sent
to
Oxford
;
where
he
continued
about
a
year
,
but
not
*NL*
well
satisfi
'd
,
wishing
of
all
things
to
see
London
,
and
become
a
*NL*
player
.
At
length
,
receiving
his
quarterly
allowance
of
fifteen
*NL*
guineas
,
instead
of
discharging
his
debts
he
walk
'd
out
of
town
,
hid
*NL*
his
gown
in
a
furze
bush
,
and
footed
it
to
London
,
where
,
having
no
*NL*
friend
to
advise
him
,
he
fell
into
bad
company
,
soon
spent
his
guineas
,
*NL*
found
no
means
of
being
introduc
'd
among
the
players
,
grew
necessitous
,
*NL*
pawn
'd
his
cloaths
,
and
wanted
bread
.
Walking
the
street
very
hungry
,
*NL*
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
,
a
crimp
's
bill
was
put
into
*NL*
his
hand
,
offering
immediate
entertainment
and
encouragement
to
such
as
*NL*
would
bind
themselves
to
serve
in
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
directly
,
sign
'd
the
indentures
,
was
put
into
the
ship
,
and
*NL*
came
over
,
never
writing
a
line
to
acquaint
his
friends
what
was
become
*NL*
of
him
.
He
was
lively
,
witty
,
good-natur
'd
,
and
a
pleasant
companion
,
*NL*
but
idle
,
thoughtless
,
and
imprudent
to
the
last
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
,
the
Irishman
,
soon
ran
away
;
with
the
rest
I
began
to
live
very
*NL*
agreeably
,
for
they
all
respected
me
the
more
,
as
they
found
Keimer
*NL*
incapable
of
instructing
them
,
and
that
from
me
they
learned
something
*NL*
daily
.
We
never
worked
on
Saturday
,
that
being
Keimer
's
Sabbath
,
so
I
*NL*
had
two
days
for
reading
.
My
acquaintance
with
ingenious
people
in
the
*NL*
town
increased
.
Keimer
himself
treated
me
with
great
civility
and
*NL*
apparent
regard
,
and
nothing
now
made
me
uneasy
but
my
debt
to
Vernon
,
*NL*
which
I
was
yet
unable
to
pay
,
being
hitherto
but
a
poor
oeconomist
.
*NL*
He
,
however
,
kindly
made
no
demand
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
printing-house
often
wanted
sorts
,
and
there
was
no
letter-founder
*NL*
in
America
;
I
had
seen
types
cast
at
James
's
in
London
,
but
without
*NL*
much
attention
to
the
manner
;
however
,
I
now
contrived
a
mould
,
made
*NL*
use
of
the
letters
we
had
as
puncheons
,
struck
the
matrices
in
lead
,
*NL*
And
thus
supply
'd
in
a
pretty
tolerable
way
all
deficiencies
.
I
also
*NL*
engrav
'd
several
things
on
occasion
;
I
made
the
ink
;
I
was
*NL*
warehouseman
,
and
everything
,
and
,
in
short
,
quite
a
factotum
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
however
serviceable
I
might
be
,
I
found
that
my
services
became
*NL*
every
day
of
less
importance
,
as
the
other
hands
improv
'd
in
the
*NL*
business
;
and
,
when
Keimer
paid
my
second
quarter
's
wages
,
he
let
me
*NL*
know
that
he
felt
them
too
heavy
,
and
thought
I
should
make
an
*NL*
abatement
.
He
grew
by
degrees
less
civil
,
put
on
more
of
the
master
,
*NL*
frequently
found
fault
,
was
captious
,
and
seem
'd
ready
for
an
*NL*
outbreaking
.
I
went
on
,
nevertheless
,
with
a
good
deal
of
patience
,
*NL*
thinking
that
his
encumber
'd
circumstances
were
partly
the
cause
.
At
*NL*
length
a
trifle
snapt
our
connections
;
for
,
a
great
noise
happening
*NL*
near
the
court-house
,
I
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
to
see
what
was
*NL*
the
matter
.
Keimer
,
being
in
the
street
,
look
'd
up
and
saw
me
,
call
'd
*NL*
out
to
me
in
a
loud
voice
and
angry
tone
to
mind
my
business
,
adding
*NL*
some
reproachful
words
,
that
nettled
me
the
more
for
their
publicity
,
*NL*
all
the
neighbors
who
were
looking
out
on
the
same
occasion
being
*NL*
witnesses
how
I
was
treated
.
He
came
up
immediately
into
the
*NL*
printing-house
,
continu
'd
the
quarrel
,
high
words
pass
'd
on
both
sides
,
*NL*
he
gave
me
the
quarter
's
warning
we
had
stipulated
,
expressing
a
wish
*NL*
that
he
had
not
been
oblig
'd
to
so
long
a
warning
.
I
told
him
his
wish
*NL*
was
unnecessary
,
for
I
would
leave
him
that
instant
;
and
so
,
taking
my
*NL*
hat
,
walk
'd
out
of
doors
,
desiring
Meredith
,
whom
I
saw
below
,
to
take
*NL*
care
of
some
things
I
left
,
and
bring
them
to
my
lodgings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meredith
came
accordingly
in
the
evening
,
when
we
talked
my
affair
*NL*
over
.
He
had
conceiv
'd
a
great
regard
for
me
,
and
was
very
unwilling
*NL*
that
I
should
leave
the
house
while
he
remain
'd
in
it
.
He
dissuaded
me
*NL*
from
returning
to
my
native
country
,
which
I
began
to
think
of
;
he
*NL*
reminded
me
that
Keimer
was
in
debt
for
all
he
possess
'd
;
that
his
*NL*
creditors
began
to
be
uneasy
;
that
he
kept
his
shop
miserably
,
sold
*NL*
often
without
profit
for
ready
money
,
and
often
trusted
without
keeping
*NL*
accounts
;
that
he
must
therefore
fall
,
which
would
make
a
vacancy
I
*NL*
might
profit
of
.
I
objected
my
want
of
money
.
He
then
let
me
know
*NL*
that
his
father
had
a
high
opinion
of
me
,
and
,
from
some
discourse
that
*NL*
had
pass
'd
between
them
,
he
was
sure
would
advance
money
to
set
us
up
,
*NL*
if
I
would
enter
into
partnership
with
him
.
``
My
time
,
''
says
he
,
``
will
*NL*
be
out
with
Keimer
in
the
spring
;
by
that
time
we
may
have
our
press
*NL*
and
types
in
from
London
.
I
am
sensible
I
am
no
workman
;
if
you
like
*NL*
it
,
your
skill
in
the
business
shall
be
set
against
the
stock
I
*NL*
furnish
,
and
we
will
share
the
profits
equally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
proposal
was
agreeable
,
and
I
consented
;
his
father
was
in
town
and
*NL*
approv
'd
of
it
;
the
more
as
he
saw
I
had
great
influence
with
his
son
,
*NL*
had
prevail
'd
on
him
to
abstain
long
from
dram-drinking
,
and
he
hop
'd
*NL*
might
break
him
off
that
wretched
habit
entirely
,
when
we
came
to
be
so
*NL*
closely
connected
.
I
gave
an
inventory
to
the
father
,
who
carry
'd
it
*NL*
to
a
merchant
;
the
things
were
sent
for
,
the
secret
was
to
be
kept
till
*NL*
they
should
arrive
,
and
in
the
mean
time
I
was
to
get
work
,
if
I
could
,
*NL*
at
the
other
printing-house
.
But
I
found
no
vacancy
there
,
and
so
*NL*
remain
'd
idle
a
few
days
,
when
Keimer
,
on
a
prospect
of
being
employ
'd
*NL*
to
print
some
paper
money
in
New
Jersey
,
which
would
require
cuts
and
*NL*
various
types
that
I
only
could
supply
,
and
apprehending
Bradford
might
*NL*
engage
me
and
get
the
jobb
from
him
,
sent
me
a
very
civil
message
,
that
*NL*
old
friends
should
not
part
for
a
few
words
,
the
effect
of
sudden
*NL*
passion
,
and
wishing
me
to
return
.
Meredith
persuaded
me
to
comply
,
as
*NL*
it
would
give
more
opportunity
for
his
improvement
under
my
daily
*NL*
instructions
;
so
I
return
'd
,
and
we
went
on
more
smoothly
than
for
some
*NL*
time
before
.
The
New
Jersey
jobb
was
obtain
'd
,
I
contriv
'd
a
*NL*
copperplate
press
for
it
,
the
first
that
had
been
seen
in
the
country
;
*NL*
I
cut
several
ornaments
and
checks
for
the
bills
.
We
went
together
to
*NL*
Burlington
,
where
I
executed
the
whole
to
satisfaction
;
and
he
received
*NL*
so
large
a
sum
for
the
work
as
to
be
enabled
thereby
to
keep
his
head
*NL*
much
longer
above
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Burlington
I
made
an
acquaintance
with
many
principal
people
of
the
*NL*
province
.
Several
of
them
had
been
appointed
by
the
Assembly
a
*NL*
committee
to
attend
the
press
,
and
take
care
that
no
more
bills
were
*NL*
printed
than
the
law
directed
.
They
were
therefore
,
by
turns
,
*NL*
constantly
with
us
,
and
generally
he
who
attended
,
brought
with
him
a
*NL*
friend
or
two
for
company
.
My
mind
having
been
much
more
improv
'd
by
*NL*
reading
than
Keimer
's
,
I
suppose
it
was
for
that
reason
my
conversation
*NL*
seem
'd
to
be
more
valu
'd
.
They
had
me
to
their
houses
,
introduced
me
to
*NL*
their
friends
,
and
show
'd
me
much
civility
;
while
he
,
tho
'
the
master
,
*NL*
was
a
little
neglected
.
In
truth
,
he
was
an
odd
fish
;
ignorant
of
*NL*
common
life
,
fond
of
rudely
opposing
receiv
'd
opinions
,
slovenly
to
*NL*
extream
dirtiness
,
enthusiastic
in
some
points
of
religion
,
and
a
*NL*
little
knavish
withal
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
continu
'd
there
near
three
months
;
and
by
that
time
I
could
reckon
*NL*
among
my
acquired
friends
,
Judge
Allen
,
Samuel
Bustill
,
the
secretary
*NL*
of
the
Province
,
Isaac
Pearson
,
Joseph
Cooper
,
and
several
of
the
*NL*
Smiths
,
members
of
Assembly
,
and
Isaac
Decow
,
the
surveyor-general
.
The
*NL*
latter
was
a
shrewd
,
sagacious
old
man
,
who
told
me
that
he
began
for
*NL*
himself
,
when
young
,
by
wheeling
clay
for
the
brick-makers
,
learned
to
*NL*
write
after
he
was
of
age
,
carri
'd
the
chain
for
surveyors
,
who
taught
*NL*
him
surveying
,
and
he
had
now
by
his
industry
,
acquir
'd
a
good
estate
;
*NL*
and
says
he
,
``
I
foresee
that
you
will
soon
work
this
man
out
of
*NL*
business
,
and
make
a
fortune
in
it
at
Philadelphia
.
''
He
had
not
then
*NL*
the
least
intimation
of
my
intention
to
set
up
there
or
anywhere
.
*NL*
These
friends
were
afterwards
of
great
use
to
me
,
as
I
occasionally
was
*NL*
to
some
of
them
.
They
all
continued
their
regard
for
me
as
long
as
*NL*
they
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
enter
upon
my
public
appearance
in
business
,
it
may
be
well
to
*NL*
let
you
know
the
then
state
of
my
mind
with
regard
to
my
principles
and
*NL*
morals
,
that
you
may
see
how
far
those
influenc
'd
the
future
events
of
*NL*
my
life
.
My
parents
had
early
given
me
religious
impressions
,
and
*NL*
brought
me
through
my
childhood
piously
in
the
Dissenting
way
.
But
I
*NL*
was
scarce
fifteen
,
when
,
after
doubting
by
turns
of
several
points
,
as
*NL*
I
found
them
disputed
in
the
different
books
I
read
,
I
began
to
doubt
*NL*
of
Revelation
itself
.
Some
books
against
Deism
fell
into
my
hands
;
*NL*
they
were
said
to
be
the
substance
of
sermons
preached
at
Boyle
's
*NL*
Lectures
.
It
happened
that
they
wrought
an
effect
on
me
quite
contrary
*NL*
to
what
was
intended
by
them
;
for
the
arguments
of
the
Deists
,
which
*NL*
were
quoted
to
be
refuted
,
appeared
to
me
much
stronger
than
the
*NL*
refutations
;
in
short
,
I
soon
became
a
thorough
Deist
.
My
arguments
*NL*
perverted
some
others
,
particularly
Collins
and
Ralph
;
but
,
each
of
*NL*
them
having
afterwards
wrong
'd
me
greatly
without
the
least
*NL*
compunction
,
and
recollecting
Keith
's
conduct
towards
me
-LRB-
who
was
*NL*
another
freethinker
-RRB-
,
and
my
own
towards
Vernon
and
Miss
Read
,
which
at
*NL*
times
gave
me
great
trouble
,
I
began
to
suspect
that
this
doctrine
,
*NL*
tho
'
it
might
be
true
,
was
not
very
useful
.
My
London
pamphlet
,
which
*NL*
had
for
its
motto
these
lines
of
Dryden
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
is
,
is
right
.
Though
purblind
man
*NL*
Sees
but
a
part
o
'
the
chain
,
the
nearest
link
:
*NL*
His
eyes
not
carrying
to
the
equal
beam
,
*NL*
That
poises
all
above
;
''
*NL*
*NL*
and
from
the
attributes
of
God
,
his
infinite
wisdom
,
goodness
and
*NL*
power
,
concluded
that
nothing
could
possibly
be
wrong
in
the
world
,
and
*NL*
that
vice
and
virtue
were
empty
distinctions
,
no
such
things
existing
,
*NL*
appear
'd
now
not
so
clever
a
performance
as
I
once
thought
it
;
and
I
*NL*
doubted
whether
some
error
had
not
insinuated
itself
unperceiv
'd
into
*NL*
my
argument
,
so
as
to
infect
all
that
follow
'd
,
as
is
common
in
*NL*
metaphysical
reasonings
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
grew
convinc
'd
that
truth
,
sincerity
and
integrity
in
dealings
*NL*
between
man
and
man
were
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
felicity
of
*NL*
life
;
and
I
form
'd
written
resolutions
,
which
still
remain
in
my
*NL*
journal
book
,
to
practice
them
ever
while
I
lived
.
Revelation
had
*NL*
indeed
no
weight
with
me
,
as
such
;
but
I
entertain
'd
an
opinion
that
,
*NL*
though
certain
actions
might
not
be
bad
because
they
were
forbidden
by
*NL*
it
,
or
good
because
it
commanded
them
,
yet
probably
these
actions
might
*NL*
be
forbidden
because
they
were
bad
for
us
,
or
commanded
because
they
*NL*
were
beneficial
to
us
,
in
their
own
natures
,
all
the
circumstances
of
*NL*
things
considered
.
And
this
persuasion
,
with
the
kind
hand
of
*NL*
Providence
,
or
some
guardian
angel
,
or
accidental
favorable
*NL*
circumstances
and
situations
,
or
all
together
,
preserved
me
,
thro
'
this
*NL*
dangerous
time
of
youth
,
and
the
hazardous
situations
I
was
sometimes
*NL*
in
among
strangers
,
remote
from
the
eye
and
advice
of
my
father
,
*NL*
without
any
willful
gross
immorality
or
injustice
,
that
might
have
been
*NL*
expected
from
my
want
of
religion
.
I
say
willful
,
because
the
*NL*
instances
I
have
mentioned
had
something
of
necessity
in
them
,
from
my
*NL*
youth
,
inexperience
,
and
the
knavery
of
others
.
I
had
therefore
a
*NL*
tolerable
character
to
begin
the
world
with
;
I
valued
it
properly
,
and
*NL*
determin
'd
to
preserve
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
not
been
long
return
'd
to
Philadelphia
before
the
new
types
*NL*
arriv
'd
from
London
.
We
settled
with
Keimer
,
and
left
him
by
his
*NL*
consent
before
he
heard
of
it
.
We
found
a
house
to
hire
near
the
*NL*
market
,
and
took
it
.
To
lessen
the
rent
,
which
was
then
but
*NL*
twenty-four
pounds
a
year
,
tho
'
I
have
since
known
it
to
let
for
*NL*
seventy
,
we
took
in
Thomas
Godfrey
,
a
glazier
,
and
his
family
,
who
were
*NL*
to
pay
a
considerable
part
of
it
to
us
,
and
we
to
board
with
them
.
We
*NL*
had
scarce
opened
our
letters
and
put
our
press
in
order
,
before
George
*NL*
House
,
an
acquaintance
of
mine
,
brought
a
countryman
to
us
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
met
in
the
street
inquiring
for
a
printer
.
All
our
cash
was
now
*NL*
expended
in
the
variety
of
particulars
we
had
been
obliged
to
procure
,
*NL*
and
this
countryman
's
five
shillings
,
being
our
first-fruits
,
and
*NL*
coming
so
seasonably
,
gave
me
more
pleasure
than
any
crown
I
have
since
*NL*
earned
;
and
the
gratitude
I
felt
toward
House
has
made
me
often
more
*NL*
ready
than
perhaps
I
should
otherwise
have
been
to
assist
young
*NL*
beginners
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
croakers
in
every
country
,
always
boding
its
ruin
.
Such
a
*NL*
one
then
lived
in
Philadelphia
;
a
person
of
note
,
an
elderly
man
,
with
*NL*
a
wise
look
and
a
very
grave
manner
of
speaking
;
his
name
was
Samuel
*NL*
Mickle
.
This
gentleman
,
a
stranger
to
me
,
stopt
one
day
at
my
door
,
*NL*
and
asked
me
if
I
was
the
young
man
who
had
lately
opened
a
new
*NL*
printing-house
.
Being
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
he
said
he
was
sorry
*NL*
for
me
,
because
it
was
an
expensive
undertaking
,
and
the
expense
would
*NL*
be
lost
;
for
Philadelphia
was
a
sinking
place
,
the
people
already
*NL*
half-bankrupts
,
or
near
being
so
;
all
appearances
to
the
contrary
,
such
*NL*
as
new
buildings
and
the
rise
of
rents
,
being
to
his
certain
knowledge
*NL*
fallacious
;
for
they
were
,
in
fact
,
among
the
things
that
would
soon
*NL*
ruin
us
.
And
he
gave
me
such
a
detail
of
misfortunes
now
existing
,
or
*NL*
that
were
soon
to
exist
,
that
he
left
me
half
melancholy
.
Had
I
known
*NL*
him
before
I
engaged
in
this
business
,
probably
I
never
should
have
*NL*
done
it
.
This
man
continued
to
live
in
this
decaying
place
,
and
to
*NL*
declaim
in
the
same
strain
,
refusing
for
many
years
to
buy
a
house
*NL*
there
,
because
all
was
going
to
destruction
;
and
at
last
I
had
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
seeing
him
give
five
times
as
much
for
one
as
he
might
have
*NL*
bought
it
for
when
he
first
began
his
croaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
mentioned
before
,
that
,
in
the
autumn
of
the
preceding
*NL*
year
,
I
had
form
'd
most
of
my
ingenious
acquaintance
into
a
club
of
*NL*
mutual
improvement
,
which
we
called
the
JUNTO
;
we
met
on
Friday
*NL*
evenings
.
The
rules
that
I
drew
up
required
that
every
member
,
in
his
*NL*
turn
,
should
produce
one
or
more
queries
on
any
point
of
Morals
,
*NL*
Politics
,
or
Natural
Philosophy
,
to
be
discuss
'd
by
the
company
;
and
*NL*
once
in
three
months
produce
and
read
an
essay
of
his
own
writing
,
on
*NL*
any
subject
he
pleased
.
Our
debates
were
to
be
under
the
direction
of
*NL*
a
president
,
and
to
be
conducted
in
the
sincere
spirit
of
inquiry
after
*NL*
truth
,
without
fondness
for
dispute
,
or
desire
of
victory
;
and
,
to
*NL*
prevent
warmth
,
all
expressions
of
positiveness
in
opinions
,
or
direct
*NL*
contradiction
,
were
after
some
time
made
contraband
,
and
prohibited
*NL*
under
small
pecuniary
penalties
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
members
were
Joseph
Breintnal
,
a
copyer
of
deeds
for
the
*NL*
scriveners
,
a
good-natur
'd
,
friendly
,
middle-ag
'd
man
,
a
great
lover
of
*NL*
poetry
,
reading
all
he
could
meet
with
,
and
writing
some
that
was
*NL*
tolerable
;
very
ingenious
in
many
little
Nicknackeries
,
and
of
sensible
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomas
Godfrey
,
a
self-taught
mathematician
,
great
in
his
way
,
and
*NL*
afterward
inventor
of
what
is
now
called
Hadley
's
Quadrant
.
But
he
*NL*
knew
little
out
of
his
way
,
and
was
not
a
pleasing
companion
;
as
,
like
*NL*
most
great
mathematicians
I
have
met
with
,
he
expected
universal
*NL*
precision
in
everything
said
,
or
was
for
ever
denying
or
distinguishing
*NL*
upon
trifles
,
to
the
disturbance
of
all
conversation
.
He
soon
left
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
Scull
,
a
surveyor
,
afterwards
surveyor-general
,
who
lov
'd
*NL*
books
,
and
sometimes
made
a
few
verses
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
Parsons
,
bred
a
shoemaker
,
but
loving
reading
,
had
acquir
'd
a
*NL*
considerable
share
of
mathematics
,
which
he
first
studied
with
a
view
*NL*
to
astrology
,
that
he
afterwards
laught
at
it
.
He
also
became
*NL*
surveyor-general
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
Maugridge
,
a
joiner
,
a
most
exquisite
mechanic
,
and
a
solid
,
*NL*
sensible
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hugh
Meredith
,
Stephen
Potts
,
and
George
Webb
I
have
characteriz
'd
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
Grace
,
a
young
gentleman
of
some
fortune
,
generous
,
lively
,
and
*NL*
witty
;
a
lover
of
punning
and
of
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
William
Coleman
,
then
a
merchant
's
clerk
,
about
my
age
,
who
had
the
*NL*
coolest
,
dearest
head
,
the
best
heart
,
and
the
exactest
morals
of
*NL*
almost
any
man
I
ever
met
with
.
He
became
afterwards
a
merchant
of
*NL*
great
note
,
and
one
of
our
provincial
judges
.
Our
friendship
continued
*NL*
without
interruption
to
his
death
,
upward
of
forty
years
;
and
the
club
*NL*
continued
almost
as
long
,
and
was
the
best
school
of
philosophy
,
*NL*
morality
,
and
politics
that
then
existed
in
the
province
;
for
our
*NL*
queries
,
which
were
read
the
week
preceding
their
discussion
,
put
us
*NL*
upon
reading
with
attention
upon
the
several
subjects
,
that
we
might
*NL*
speak
more
to
the
purpose
;
and
here
,
too
,
we
acquired
better
habits
of
*NL*
conversation
,
every
thing
being
studied
in
our
rules
which
might
*NL*
prevent
our
disgusting
each
other
.
From
hence
the
long
continuance
of
*NL*
the
club
,
which
I
shall
have
frequent
occasion
to
speak
further
of
*NL*
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
giving
this
account
of
it
here
is
to
show
something
of
the
*NL*
interest
I
had
,
every
one
of
these
exerting
themselves
in
recommending
*NL*
business
to
us
.
Breintnal
particularly
procur
'd
us
from
the
Quakers
*NL*
the
printing
forty
sheets
of
their
history
,
the
rest
being
to
be
done
*NL*
by
Keimer
;
and
upon
this
we
work
'd
exceedingly
hard
,
for
the
price
was
*NL*
low
.
It
was
a
folio
,
pro
patria
size
,
in
pica
,
with
long
primer
notes
.
*NL*
I
compos
'd
of
it
a
sheet
a
day
,
and
Meredith
worked
it
off
at
press
;
it
*NL*
was
often
eleven
at
night
,
and
sometimes
later
,
before
I
had
finished
*NL*
my
distribution
for
the
next
day
's
work
,
for
the
little
jobbs
sent
in
*NL*
by
our
other
friends
now
and
then
put
us
back
.
But
so
determin
'd
I
was
*NL*
to
continue
doing
a
sheet
a
day
of
the
folio
,
that
one
night
,
when
,
*NL*
having
impos
'd
my
forms
,
I
thought
my
day
's
work
over
,
one
of
them
by
*NL*
accident
was
broken
,
and
two
pages
reduced
to
pi
,
I
immediately
*NL*
distributed
and
compos
'd
it
over
again
before
I
went
to
bed
;
and
this
*NL*
industry
,
visible
to
our
neighbors
,
began
to
give
us
character
and
*NL*
credit
;
particularly
,
I
was
told
,
that
mention
being
made
of
the
new
*NL*
printing-office
at
the
merchants
'
Every-night
club
,
the
general
opinion
*NL*
was
that
it
must
fail
,
there
being
already
two
printers
in
the
place
,
*NL*
Keimer
and
Bradford
;
but
Dr.
Baird
-LRB-
whom
you
and
I
saw
many
years
after
*NL*
at
his
native
place
,
St.
Andrew
's
in
Scotland
-RRB-
gave
a
contrary
opinion
:
*NL*
``
For
the
industry
of
that
Franklin
,
''
says
he
,
``
is
superior
to
any
thing
*NL*
I
ever
saw
of
the
kind
;
I
see
him
still
at
work
when
I
go
home
from
*NL*
club
,
and
he
is
at
work
again
before
his
neighbors
are
out
of
bed
.
''
*NL*
This
struck
the
rest
,
and
we
soon
after
had
offers
from
one
of
them
to
*NL*
supply
us
with
stationery
;
but
as
yet
we
did
not
chuse
to
engage
in
*NL*
shop
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mention
this
industry
the
more
particularly
and
the
more
freely
,
tho
'
*NL*
it
seems
to
be
talking
in
my
own
praise
,
that
those
of
my
posterity
,
*NL*
who
shall
read
it
,
may
know
the
use
of
that
virtue
,
when
they
see
its
*NL*
effects
in
my
favour
throughout
this
relation
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Webb
,
who
had
found
a
female
friend
that
lent
him
wherewith
to
*NL*
purchase
his
time
of
Keimer
,
now
came
to
offer
himself
as
a
journeyman
*NL*
to
us
.
We
could
not
then
employ
him
;
but
I
foolishly
let
him
know
as
a
*NL*
secret
that
I
soon
intended
to
begin
a
newspaper
,
and
might
then
have
*NL*
work
for
him
.
My
hopes
of
success
,
as
I
told
him
,
were
founded
on
*NL*
this
,
that
the
then
only
newspaper
,
printed
by
Bradford
,
was
a
paltry
*NL*
thing
,
wretchedly
manag
'd
,
no
way
entertaining
,
and
yet
was
profitable
*NL*
to
him
;
I
therefore
thought
a
good
paper
would
scarcely
fail
of
good
*NL*
encouragement
.
I
requested
Webb
not
to
mention
it
;
but
he
told
it
to
*NL*
Keimer
,
who
immediately
,
to
be
beforehand
with
me
,
published
proposals
*NL*
for
printing
one
himself
,
on
which
Webb
was
to
be
employ
'd
.
I
resented
*NL*
this
;
and
,
to
counteract
them
,
as
I
could
not
yet
begin
our
paper
,
I
*NL*
wrote
several
pieces
of
entertainment
for
Bradford
's
paper
,
under
the
*NL*
title
of
the
BUSY
BODY
,
which
Breintnal
continu
'd
some
months
.
By
this
*NL*
means
the
attention
of
the
publick
was
fixed
on
that
paper
,
and
*NL*
Keimer
's
proposals
,
which
we
burlesqu
'd
and
ridicul
'd
,
were
*NL*
disregarded
.
He
began
his
paper
,
however
,
and
,
after
carrying
it
on
*NL*
three
quarters
of
a
year
,
with
at
most
only
ninety
subscribers
,
he
*NL*
offered
it
to
me
for
a
trifle
;
and
I
,
having
been
ready
some
time
to
go
*NL*
on
with
it
,
took
it
in
hand
directly
;
and
it
prov
'd
in
a
few
years
*NL*
extremely
profitable
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
perceive
that
I
am
apt
to
speak
in
the
singular
number
,
though
our
*NL*
partnership
still
continu
'd
;
the
reason
may
be
that
,
in
fact
,
the
whole
*NL*
management
of
the
business
lay
upon
me
.
Meredith
was
no
compositor
,
a
*NL*
poor
pressman
,
and
seldom
sober
.
My
friends
lamented
my
connection
*NL*
with
him
,
but
I
was
to
make
the
best
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
first
papers
made
a
quite
different
appearance
from
any
before
in
*NL*
the
province
;
a
better
type
,
and
better
printed
;
but
some
spirited
*NL*
remarks
of
my
writing
,
on
the
dispute
then
going
on
between
Governor
*NL*
Burnet
and
the
Massachusetts
Assembly
,
struck
the
principal
people
,
*NL*
occasioned
the
paper
and
the
manager
of
it
to
be
much
talk
'd
of
,
and
in
*NL*
a
few
weeks
brought
them
all
to
be
our
subscribers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
example
was
follow
'd
by
many
,
and
our
number
went
on
growing
*NL*
continually
.
This
was
one
of
the
first
good
effects
of
my
having
*NL*
learnt
a
little
to
scribble
;
another
was
,
that
the
leading
men
,
seeing
*NL*
a
newspaper
now
in
the
hands
of
one
who
could
also
handle
a
pen
,
*NL*
thought
it
convenient
to
oblige
and
encourage
me
.
Bradford
still
*NL*
printed
the
votes
,
and
laws
,
and
other
publick
business
.
He
had
*NL*
printed
an
address
of
the
House
to
the
governor
,
in
a
coarse
,
*NL*
blundering
manner
,
we
reprinted
it
elegantly
and
correctly
,
and
sent
*NL*
one
to
every
member
.
They
were
sensible
of
the
difference
:
it
*NL*
strengthened
the
hands
of
our
friends
in
the
House
,
and
they
voted
us
*NL*
their
printers
for
the
year
ensuing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
my
friends
in
the
House
I
must
not
forget
Mr.
Hamilton
,
before
*NL*
mentioned
,
who
was
then
returned
from
England
,
and
had
a
seat
in
it
.
*NL*
He
interested
himself
for
me
strongly
in
that
instance
,
as
he
did
in
*NL*
many
others
afterward
,
continuing
his
patronage
till
his
death
.

Mr.
Vernon
,
about
this
time
,
put
me
in
mind
of
the
debt
I
ow
'd
him
,
but
*NL*
did
not
press
me
.
I
wrote
him
an
ingenuous
letter
of
acknowledgment
,
*NL*
crav
'd
his
forbearance
a
little
longer
,
which
he
allow
'd
me
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
was
able
,
I
paid
the
principal
with
interest
,
and
many
*NL*
thanks
;
so
that
erratum
was
in
some
degree
corrected
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
another
difficulty
came
upon
me
which
I
had
never
the
least
*NL*
reason
to
expect
.
Mr.
Meredith
's
father
,
who
was
to
have
paid
for
our
*NL*
printing-house
,
according
to
the
expectations
given
me
,
was
able
to
*NL*
advance
only
one
hundred
pounds
currency
,
which
had
been
paid
;
and
a
*NL*
hundred
more
was
due
to
the
merchant
,
who
grew
impatient
,
and
su
'd
us
*NL*
all
.
We
gave
bail
,
but
saw
that
,
if
the
money
could
not
be
rais
'd
in
*NL*
time
,
the
suit
must
soon
come
to
a
judgment
and
execution
,
and
our
*NL*
hopeful
prospects
must
,
with
us
,
be
ruined
,
as
the
press
and
letters
*NL*
must
be
sold
for
payment
,
perhaps
at
half
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
distress
two
true
friends
,
whose
kindness
I
have
never
*NL*
forgotten
,
nor
ever
shall
forget
while
I
can
remember
any
thing
,
came
*NL*
to
me
separately
,
unknown
to
each
other
,
and
,
without
any
application
*NL*
from
me
,
offering
each
of
them
to
advance
me
all
the
money
that
should
*NL*
be
necessary
to
enable
me
to
take
the
whole
business
upon
myself
,
if
*NL*
that
should
be
practicable
;
but
they
did
not
like
my
continuing
the
*NL*
partnership
with
Meredith
,
who
,
as
they
said
,
was
often
seen
drunk
in
*NL*
the
streets
,
and
playing
at
low
games
in
alehouses
,
much
to
our
*NL*
discredit
.
These
two
friends
were
William
Coleman
and
Robert
Grace
.
I
*NL*
told
them
I
could
not
propose
a
separation
while
any
prospect
remain
'd
*NL*
of
the
Merediths
'
fulfilling
their
part
of
our
agreement
,
because
I
*NL*
thought
myself
under
great
obligations
to
them
for
what
they
had
done
,
*NL*
and
would
do
if
they
could
;
but
,
if
they
finally
fail
'd
in
their
*NL*
performance
,
and
our
partnership
must
be
dissolv
'd
,
I
should
then
think
*NL*
myself
at
liberty
to
accept
the
assistance
of
my
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
matter
rested
for
some
time
,
when
I
said
to
my
partner
,
*NL*
``
Perhaps
your
father
is
dissatisfied
at
the
part
you
have
undertaken
in
*NL*
this
affair
of
ours
,
and
is
unwilling
to
advance
for
you
and
me
what
he
*NL*
would
for
you
alone
.
If
that
is
the
case
,
tell
me
,
and
I
will
resign
*NL*
the
whole
to
you
,
and
go
about
my
business
.
''
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
``
my
father
*NL*
has
really
been
disappointed
,
and
is
really
unable
;
and
I
am
unwilling
*NL*
to
distress
him
farther
.
I
see
this
is
a
business
I
am
not
fit
for
.
I
*NL*
was
bred
a
farmer
,
and
it
was
a
folly
in
me
to
come
to
town
,
and
put
*NL*
myself
,
at
thirty
years
of
age
,
an
apprentice
to
learn
a
new
trade
.
*NL*
Many
of
our
Welsh
people
are
going
to
settle
in
North
Carolina
,
where
*NL*
land
is
cheap
.
I
am
inclin
'd
to
go
with
them
,
and
follow
my
old
*NL*
employment
.
You
may
find
friends
to
assist
you
.
If
you
will
take
the
*NL*
debts
of
the
company
upon
you
;
return
to
my
father
the
hundred
pound
he
*NL*
has
advanced
;
pay
my
little
personal
debts
,
and
give
me
thirty
pounds
*NL*
and
a
new
saddle
,
I
will
relinquish
the
partnership
,
and
leave
the
*NL*
whole
in
your
hands
.
''
I
agreed
to
this
proposal
:
it
was
drawn
up
in
*NL*
writing
,
sign
'd
,
and
seal
'd
immediately
.
I
gave
him
what
he
demanded
,
*NL*
and
he
went
soon
after
to
Carolina
,
from
whence
he
sent
me
next
year
*NL*
two
long
letters
,
containing
the
best
account
that
had
been
given
of
*NL*
that
country
,
the
climate
,
the
soil
,
husbandry
,
etc.
,
for
in
those
*NL*
matters
he
was
very
judicious
.
I
printed
them
in
the
papers
,
and
they
*NL*
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
publick
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
I
recurr
'd
to
my
two
friends
;
and
because
I
*NL*
would
not
give
an
unkind
preference
to
either
,
I
took
half
of
what
each
*NL*
had
offered
and
I
wanted
of
one
,
and
half
of
the
other
;
paid
off
the
*NL*
company
's
debts
,
and
went
on
with
the
business
in
my
own
name
,
*NL*
advertising
that
the
partnership
was
dissolved
.
I
think
this
was
in
or
*NL*
about
the
year
1729
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
there
was
a
cry
among
the
people
for
more
paper
money
,
*NL*
only
fifteen
thousand
pounds
being
extant
in
the
province
,
and
that
*NL*
soon
to
be
sunk
.
The
wealthy
inhabitants
oppos
'd
any
addition
,
being
*NL*
against
all
paper
currency
,
from
an
apprehension
that
it
would
*NL*
depreciate
,
as
it
had
done
in
New
England
,
to
the
prejudice
of
all
*NL*
creditors
.
We
had
discuss
'd
this
point
in
our
Junto
,
where
I
was
on
*NL*
the
side
of
an
addition
,
being
persuaded
that
the
first
small
sum
*NL*
struck
in
1723
had
done
much
good
by
increasing
the
trade
,
employment
,
*NL*
and
number
of
inhabitants
in
the
province
,
since
I
now
saw
all
the
old
*NL*
houses
inhabited
,
and
many
new
ones
building
;
whereas
I
remembered
*NL*
well
,
that
when
I
first
walk
'd
about
the
streets
of
Philadelphia
,
*NL*
eating
my
roll
,
I
saw
most
of
the
houses
in
Walnut-street
,
between
*NL*
Second
and
Front
streets
,
with
bills
on
their
doors
,
``
To
be
let
''
;
and
*NL*
many
likewise
in
Chestnut-street
and
other
streets
,
which
made
me
then
*NL*
think
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
were
deserting
it
one
after
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
debates
possess
'd
me
so
fully
of
the
subject
,
that
I
wrote
and
*NL*
printed
an
anonymous
pamphlet
on
it
,
entitled
``
The
Nature
and
Necessity
*NL*
of
a
Paper
Currency
.
''
It
was
well
receiv
'd
by
the
common
people
in
*NL*
general
;
but
the
rich
men
dislik
'd
it
,
for
it
increas
'd
and
*NL*
strengthen
'd
the
clamor
for
more
money
,
and
they
happening
to
have
no
*NL*
writers
among
them
that
were
able
to
answer
it
,
their
opposition
*NL*
slacken
'd
,
and
the
point
was
carried
by
a
majority
in
the
House
.
My
*NL*
friends
there
,
who
conceiv
'd
I
had
been
of
some
service
,
thought
fit
to
*NL*
reward
me
by
employing
me
in
printing
the
money
;
a
very
profitable
jobb
*NL*
and
a
great
help
to
me
.
This
was
another
advantage
gain
'd
by
my
being
*NL*
able
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
utility
of
this
currency
became
by
time
and
experience
so
evident
*NL*
as
never
afterwards
to
be
much
disputed
;
so
that
it
grew
soon
to
*NL*
fifty-five
thousand
pounds
,
and
in
1739
to
eighty
thousand
pounds
,
*NL*
since
which
it
arose
during
war
to
upwards
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
trade
,
building
,
and
inhabitants
all
the
while
*NL*
increasing
,
till
I
now
think
there
are
limits
beyond
which
the
quantity
*NL*
may
be
hurtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
after
obtain
'd
,
thro
'
my
friend
Hamilton
,
the
printing
of
the
*NL*
Newcastle
paper
money
,
another
profitable
jobb
as
I
then
thought
it
;
*NL*
small
things
appearing
great
to
those
in
small
circumstances
;
and
*NL*
these
,
to
me
,
were
really
great
advantages
,
as
they
were
great
*NL*
encouragements
.
He
procured
for
me
,
also
,
the
printing
of
the
laws
and
*NL*
votes
of
that
government
,
which
continu
'd
in
my
hands
as
long
as
I
*NL*
follow
'd
the
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
open
'd
a
little
stationer
's
shop
.
I
had
in
it
blanks
of
all
*NL*
sorts
,
the
correctest
that
ever
appear
'd
among
us
,
being
assisted
in
*NL*
that
by
my
friend
Breintnal
.
I
had
also
paper
,
parchment
,
chapmen
's
*NL*
books
,
etc.
.
One
Whitemash
,
a
compositor
I
had
known
in
London
,
an
*NL*
excellent
workman
,
now
came
to
me
,
and
work
'd
with
me
constantly
and
*NL*
diligently
;
and
I
took
an
apprentice
,
the
son
of
Aquila
Rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
now
gradually
to
pay
off
the
debt
I
was
under
for
the
*NL*
printing-house
.
In
order
to
secure
my
credit
and
character
as
a
*NL*
tradesman
,
I
took
care
not
only
to
be
in
reality
industrious
and
*NL*
frugal
,
but
to
avoid
all
appearances
to
the
contrary
.
I
drest
plainly
;
*NL*
I
was
seen
at
no
places
of
idle
diversion
.
I
never
went
out
a
fishing
*NL*
or
shooting
;
a
book
,
indeed
,
sometimes
debauch
'd
me
from
my
work
,
but
*NL*
that
was
seldom
,
snug
,
and
gave
no
scandal
;
and
,
to
show
that
I
was
not
*NL*
above
my
business
,
I
sometimes
brought
home
the
paper
I
purchas
'd
at
*NL*
the
stores
thro
'
the
streets
on
a
wheelbarrow
.
Thus
being
esteem
'd
an
*NL*
industrious
,
thriving
young
man
,
and
paying
duly
for
what
I
bought
,
the
*NL*
merchants
who
imported
stationery
solicited
my
custom
;
others
proposed
*NL*
supplying
me
with
books
,
and
I
went
on
swimmingly
.
In
the
mean
time
,
*NL*
Keimer
's
credit
and
business
declining
daily
,
he
was
at
last
forc
'd
to
*NL*
sell
his
printing
house
to
satisfy
his
creditors
.
He
went
to
*NL*
Barbadoes
,
and
there
lived
some
years
in
very
poor
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
apprentice
,
David
Harry
,
whom
I
had
instructed
while
I
work
'd
with
*NL*
him
,
set
up
in
his
place
at
Philadelphia
,
having
bought
his
materials
.
*NL*
I
was
at
first
apprehensive
of
a
powerful
rival
in
Harry
,
as
his
*NL*
friends
were
very
able
,
and
had
a
good
deal
of
interest
.
I
therefore
*NL*
propos
'd
a
partner-ship
to
him
which
he
,
fortunately
for
me
,
rejected
*NL*
with
scorn
.
He
was
very
proud
,
dress
'd
like
a
gentleman
,
liv
'd
*NL*
expensively
,
took
much
diversion
and
pleasure
abroad
,
ran
in
debt
,
and
*NL*
neglected
his
business
;
upon
which
,
all
business
left
him
;
and
,
finding
*NL*
nothing
to
do
,
he
followed
Keimer
to
Barbadoes
,
taking
the
*NL*
printing-house
with
him
.
There
this
apprentice
employ
'd
his
former
*NL*
master
as
a
journeyman
;
they
quarrel
'd
often
;
Harry
went
continually
*NL*
behindhand
,
and
at
length
was
forc
'd
to
sell
his
types
and
return
to
*NL*
his
country
work
in
Pensilvania
.
The
person
that
bought
them
employ
'd
*NL*
Keimer
to
use
them
,
but
in
a
few
years
he
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
remained
now
no
competitor
with
me
at
Philadelphia
but
the
old
*NL*
one
,
Bradford
;
who
was
rich
and
easy
,
did
a
little
printing
now
and
*NL*
then
by
straggling
hands
,
but
was
not
very
anxious
about
the
business
.
*NL*
However
,
as
he
kept
the
post-office
,
it
was
imagined
he
had
better
*NL*
opportunities
of
obtaining
news
;
his
paper
was
thought
a
better
*NL*
distributer
of
advertisements
than
mine
,
and
therefore
had
many
,
more
,
*NL*
which
was
a
profitable
thing
to
him
,
and
a
disadvantage
to
me
;
for
,
*NL*
tho
'
I
did
indeed
receive
and
send
papers
by
the
post
,
yet
the
publick
*NL*
opinion
was
otherwise
,
for
what
I
did
send
was
by
bribing
the
riders
,
*NL*
who
took
them
privately
,
Bradford
being
unkind
enough
to
forbid
it
,
*NL*
which
occasion
'd
some
resentment
on
my
part
;
and
I
thought
so
meanly
of
*NL*
him
for
it
,
that
,
when
I
afterward
came
into
his
situation
,
I
took
care
*NL*
never
to
imitate
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
hitherto
continu
'd
to
board
with
Godfrey
,
who
lived
in
part
of
my
*NL*
house
with
his
wife
and
children
,
and
had
one
side
of
the
shop
for
his
*NL*
glazier
's
business
,
tho
'
he
worked
little
,
being
always
absorbed
in
his
*NL*
mathematics
.
Mrs.
Godfrey
projected
a
match
for
me
with
a
relation
's
*NL*
daughter
,
took
opportunities
of
bringing
us
often
together
,
till
a
*NL*
serious
courtship
on
my
part
ensu
'd
,
the
girl
being
in
herself
very
*NL*
deserving
.
The
old
folks
encourag
'd
me
by
continual
invitations
to
*NL*
supper
,
and
by
leaving
us
together
,
till
at
length
it
was
time
to
*NL*
explain
.
Mrs.
Godfrey
manag
'd
our
little
treaty
.
I
let
her
know
that
*NL*
I
expected
as
much
money
with
their
daughter
as
would
pay
off
my
*NL*
remaining
debt
for
the
printing-house
,
which
I
believe
was
not
then
*NL*
above
a
hundred
pounds
.
She
brought
me
word
they
had
no
such
sum
to
*NL*
spare
;
I
said
they
might
mortgage
their
house
in
the
loan-office
.
The
*NL*
answer
to
this
,
after
some
days
,
was
,
that
they
did
not
approve
the
*NL*
match
;
that
,
on
inquiry
of
Bradford
,
they
had
been
inform
'd
the
*NL*
printing
business
was
not
a
profitable
one
;
the
types
would
soon
be
*NL*
worn
out
,
and
more
wanted
;
that
S.
Keimer
and
D.
Harry
had
failed
one
*NL*
after
the
other
,
and
I
should
probably
soon
follow
them
;
and
,
*NL*
therefore
,
I
was
forbidden
the
house
,
and
the
daughter
shut
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
this
was
a
real
change
of
sentiment
or
only
artifice
,
on
a
*NL*
supposition
of
our
being
too
far
engaged
in
affection
to
retract
,
and
*NL*
therefore
that
we
should
steal
a
marriage
,
which
would
leave
them
at
*NL*
liberty
to
give
or
withhold
what
they
pleas
'd
,
I
know
not
;
but
I
*NL*
suspected
the
latter
,
resented
it
,
and
went
no
more
.
Mrs.
Godfrey
*NL*
brought
me
afterward
some
more
favorable
accounts
of
their
disposition
,
*NL*
and
would
have
drawn
me
on
again
;
but
I
declared
absolutely
my
*NL*
resolution
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
that
family
.
This
was
*NL*
resented
by
the
Godfreys
;
we
differ
'd
,
and
they
removed
,
leaving
me
the
*NL*
whole
house
,
and
I
resolved
to
take
no
more
inmates
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
affair
having
turned
my
thoughts
to
marriage
,
I
look
'd
round
*NL*
me
and
made
overtures
of
acquaintance
in
other
places
;
but
soon
found
*NL*
that
,
the
business
of
a
printer
being
generally
thought
a
poor
one
,
I
*NL*
was
not
to
expect
money
with
a
wife
,
unless
with
such
a
one
as
I
should
*NL*
not
otherwise
think
agreeable
.
In
the
mean
time
,
that
*NL*
hard-to-be-governed
passion
of
youth
hurried
me
frequently
into
*NL*
intrigues
with
low
women
that
fell
in
my
way
,
which
were
attended
with
*NL*
some
expense
and
great
inconvenience
,
besides
a
continual
risque
to
my
*NL*
health
by
a
distemper
which
of
all
things
I
dreaded
,
though
by
great
*NL*
good
luck
I
escaped
it
.
A
friendly
correspondence
as
neighbors
and
old
*NL*
acquaintances
had
continued
between
me
and
Mrs.
Read
's
family
,
who
all
*NL*
had
a
regard
for
me
from
the
time
of
my
first
lodging
in
their
house
.
*NL*
I
was
often
invited
there
and
consulted
in
their
affairs
,
wherein
I
*NL*
sometimes
was
of
service
.
I
piti
'd
poor
Miss
Read
's
unfortunate
*NL*
situation
,
who
was
generally
dejected
,
seldom
cheerful
,
and
avoided
*NL*
company
.
I
considered
my
giddiness
and
inconstancy
when
in
London
as
*NL*
in
a
great
degree
the
cause
of
her
unhappiness
,
tho
'
the
mother
was
*NL*
good
enough
to
think
the
fault
more
her
own
than
mine
,
as
she
had
*NL*
prevented
our
marrying
before
I
went
thither
,
and
persuaded
the
other
*NL*
match
in
my
absence
.
Our
mutual
affection
was
revived
,
but
there
were
*NL*
now
great
objections
to
our
union
.
The
match
was
indeed
looked
upon
as
*NL*
invalid
,
a
preceding
wife
being
said
to
be
living
in
England
;
but
this
*NL*
could
not
easily
be
prov
'd
,
because
of
the
distance
;
and
,
tho
'
there
*NL*
was
a
report
of
his
death
,
it
was
not
certain
.
Then
,
tho
'
it
should
be
*NL*
true
,
he
had
left
many
debts
,
which
his
successor
might
be
call
'd
upon
*NL*
to
pay
.
We
ventured
,
however
,
over
all
these
difficulties
,
and
I
took
*NL*
her
to
wife
,
September
1st
,
1730
.
None
of
the
inconveniences
happened
*NL*
that
we
had
apprehended
,
she
proved
a
good
and
faithful
helpmate
,
*NL*
assisted
me
much
by
attending
the
shop
;
we
throve
together
,
and
have
*NL*
ever
mutually
endeavored
to
make
each
other
happy
.
Thus
I
corrected
*NL*
that
great
erratum
as
well
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
,
our
club
meeting
,
not
at
a
tavern
,
but
in
a
little
*NL*
room
of
Mr.
Grace
's
,
set
apart
for
that
purpose
,
a
proposition
was
made
*NL*
by
me
,
that
,
since
our
books
were
often
referr
'd
to
in
our
*NL*
disquisitions
upon
the
queries
,
it
might
be
convenient
to
us
to
have
*NL*
them
altogether
where
we
met
,
that
upon
occasion
they
might
be
*NL*
consulted
;
and
by
thus
clubbing
our
books
to
a
common
library
,
we
*NL*
should
,
while
we
lik
'd
to
keep
them
together
,
have
each
of
us
the
*NL*
advantage
of
using
the
books
of
all
the
other
members
,
which
would
be
*NL*
nearly
as
beneficial
as
if
each
owned
the
whole
.
It
was
lik
'd
and
*NL*
agreed
to
,
and
we
fill
'd
one
end
of
the
room
with
such
books
as
we
*NL*
could
best
spare
.
The
number
was
not
so
great
as
we
expected
;
and
tho
'
*NL*
they
had
been
of
great
use
,
yet
some
inconveniences
occurring
for
want
*NL*
of
due
care
of
them
,
the
collection
,
after
about
a
year
,
was
separated
,
*NL*
and
each
took
his
books
home
again
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
set
on
foot
my
first
project
of
a
public
nature
,
that
for
a
*NL*
subscription
library
.
I
drew
up
the
proposals
,
got
them
put
into
form
*NL*
by
our
great
scrivener
,
Brockden
,
and
,
by
the
help
of
my
friends
in
the
*NL*
Junto
,
procured
fifty
subscribers
of
forty
shillings
each
to
begin
*NL*
with
,
and
ten
shillings
a
year
for
fifty
years
,
the
term
our
company
*NL*
was
to
continue
.
We
afterwards
obtain
'd
a
charter
,
the
company
being
*NL*
increased
to
one
hundred
:
this
was
the
mother
of
all
the
North
*NL*
American
subscription
libraries
,
now
so
numerous
.
It
is
become
a
great
*NL*
thing
itself
,
and
continually
increasing
.
These
libraries
have
*NL*
improved
the
general
conversation
of
the
Americans
,
made
the
common
*NL*
tradesmen
and
farmers
as
intelligent
as
most
gentlemen
from
other
*NL*
countries
,
and
perhaps
have
contributed
in
some
degree
to
the
stand
so
*NL*
generally
made
throughout
the
colonies
in
defense
of
their
privileges
.

Thus
far
was

with

express
'd
in
the
*NL*
beginning
and
therefore
contains
several
little
family
anecdotes
of
no
*NL*
importance
to
others
.
What
follows
was
written
many
years
after
in
*NL*
compliance
with
the
advice
contain
'd
in
these
letters
,
and
accordingly
*NL*
intended
for
the
public

MY
DEAR
AND
HONORED
FRIEND
:
I
have
often
been
desirous
of
writing
to
*NL*
thee
,
but
could
not
be
reconciled
to
the
thought
that
the
letter
might
*NL*
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
British
,
lest
some
printer
or
busy-body
*NL*
should
publish
some
part
of
the
contents
,
and
give
our
friend
pain
,
and
*NL*
myself
censure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
time
since
there
fell
into
my
hands
,
to
my
great
joy
,
about
*NL*
twenty-three
sheets
in
thy
own
handwriting
,
containing
an
account
of
*NL*
the
parentage
and
life
of
thyself
,
directed
to
thy
son
,
ending
in
the
*NL*
year
1730
,
with
which
there
were
notes
,
likewise
in
thy
writing
;
a
copy
*NL*
of
which
I
inclose
,
in
hopes
it
may
be
a
means
,
if
thou
continued
it
up
*NL*
to
a
later
period
,
that
the
first
and
latter
part
may
be
put
together
;
*NL*
and
if
it
is
not
yet
continued
,
I
hope
thee
will
not
delay
it
.
Life
is
*NL*
uncertain
,
as
the
preacher
tells
us
;
and
what
will
the
world
say
if
*NL*
kind
,
humane
,
and
benevolent
Ben
.
Franklin
should
leave
his
friends
*NL*
and
the
world
deprived
of
so
pleasing
and
profitable
a
work
;
a
work
*NL*
which
would
be
useful
and
entertaining
not
only
to
a
few
,
but
to
*NL*
millions
?
The
influence
writings
under
that
class
have
on
the
minds
of
*NL*
youth
is
very
great
,
and
has
nowhere
appeared
to
me
so
plain
,
as
in
our
*NL*
public
friend
's
journals
.
It
almost
insensibly
leads
the
youth
into
*NL*
the
resolution
of
endeavoring
to
become
as
good
and
eminent
as
the
*NL*
journalist
.
Should
thine
,
for
instance
,
when
published
-LRB-
and
I
think
it
*NL*
could
not
fail
of
it
-RRB-
,
lead
the
youth
to
equal
the
industry
and
*NL*
temperance
of
thy
early
youth
,
what
a
blessing
with
that
class
would
*NL*
such
a
work
be
!
I
know
of
no
character
living
,
nor
many
of
them
put
*NL*
together
,
who
has
so
much
in
his
power
as
thyself
to
promote
a
greater
*NL*
spirit
of
industry
and
early
attention
to
business
,
frugality
,
and
*NL*
temperance
with
the
American
youth
.
Not
that
I
think
the
work
would
*NL*
have
no
other
merit
and
use
in
the
world
,
far
from
it
;
but
the
first
is
*NL*
of
such
vast
importance
that
I
know
nothing
that
can
equal
it

the

*NL*
``
PARIS
,
January

*NL*
``
My
DEAREST
SIR
:
When
I
had
read
over
your
sheets
of
minutes
of
the
*NL*
principal
incidents
of
your
life
,
recovered
for
you
by
your
Quaker
*NL*
acquaintance
,
I
told
you
I
would
send
you
a
letter
expressing
my
*NL*
reasons
why
I
thought
it
would
be
useful
to
complete
and
publish
it
as
*NL*
he
desired
.
Various
concerns
have
for
some
time
past
prevented
this
*NL*
letter
being
written
,
and
I
do
not
know
whether
it
was
worth
any
*NL*
expectation
;
happening
to
be
at
leisure
,
however
,
at
present
,
I
shall
*NL*
by
writing
,
at
least
interest
and
instruct
myself
;
but
as
the
terms
I
*NL*
am
inclined
to
use
may
tend
to
offend
a
person
of
your
manners
,
I
shall
*NL*
only
tell
you
how
I
would
address
any
other
person
,
who
was
as
good
and
*NL*
as
great
as
yourself
,
but
less
diffident
.
I
would
say
to
him
,
Sir
,
I
*NL*
solicit
the
history
of
your
life
from
the
following
motives
:
Your
*NL*
history
is
so
remarkable
,
that
if
you
do
not
give
it
,
somebody
else
*NL*
will
certainly
give
it
;
and
perhaps
so
as
nearly
to
do
as
much
harm
,
as
*NL*
your
own
management
of
the
thing
might
do
good
.
It
will
moreover
*NL*
present
a
table
of
the
internal
circumstances
of
your
country
,
which
*NL*
will
very
much
tend
to
invite
to
it
settlers
of
virtuous
and
manly
*NL*
minds
.
And
considering
the
eagerness
with
which
such
information
is
*NL*
sought
by
them
,
and
the
extent
of
your
reputation
,
I
do
not
know
of
a
*NL*
more
efficacious
advertisement
than
your
biography
would
give
.
All
*NL*
that
has
happened
to
you
is
also
connected
with
the
detail
of
the
*NL*
manners
and
situation
of
a
rising
people
;
and
in
this
respect
I
do
not
*NL*
think
that
the
writings
of
Caesar
and
Tacitus
can
be
more
interesting
*NL*
to
a
true
judge
of
human
nature
and
society
.
But
these
,
sir
,
are
small
*NL*
reasons
,
in
my
opinion
,
compared
with
the
chance
which
your
life
will
*NL*
give
for
the
forming
of
future
great
men
;
and
in
conjunction
with
your
*NL*
Art
of
Virtue
-LRB-
which
you
design
to
publish
-RRB-
of
improving
the
features
*NL*
of
private
character
,
and
consequently
of
aiding
all
happiness
,
both
*NL*
public
and
domestic
.
The
two
works
I
allude
to
,
sir
,
will
in
*NL*
particular
give
a
noble
rule
and
example
of
self-education
.
School
and
*NL*
other
education
constantly
proceed
upon
false
principles
,
and
show
a
*NL*
clumsy
apparatus
pointed
at
a
false
mark
;
but
your
apparatus
is
simple
,
*NL*
and
the
mark
a
true
one
;
and
while
parents
and
young
persons
are
left
*NL*
destitute
of
other
just
means
of
estimating
and
becoming
prepared
for
a
*NL*
reasonable
course
in
life
,
your
discovery
that
the
thing
is
in
many
a
*NL*
man
's
private
power
,
will
be
invaluable
!
Influence
upon
the
private
*NL*
character
,
late
in
life
,
is
not
only
an
influence
late
in
life
,
but
a
*NL*
weak
influence
.
It
is
in
youth
that
we
plant
our
chief
habits
and
*NL*
prejudices
;
it
is
in
youth
that
we
take
our
party
as
to
profession
,
*NL*
pursuits
and
matrimony
.
In
youth
,
therefore
,
the
turn
is
given
;
in
*NL*
youth
the
education
even
of
the
next
generation
is
given
;
in
youth
the
*NL*
private
and
public
character
is
determined
;
and
the
term
of
life
*NL*
extending
but
from
youth
to
age
,
life
ought
to
begin
well
from
youth
,
*NL*
and
more
especially
before
we
take
our
party
as
to
our
principal
*NL*
objects
.
But
your
biography
will
not
merely
teach
self-education
,
but
*NL*
the
education
of
a
wise
man
;
and
the
wisest
man
will
receive
lights
and
*NL*
improve
his
progress
,
by
seeing
detailed
the
conduct
of
another
wise
*NL*
man
.
And
why
are
weaker
men
to
be
deprived
of
such
helps
,
when
we
see
*NL*
our
race
has
been
blundering
on
in
the
dark
,
almost
without
a
guide
in
*NL*
this
particular
,
from
the
farthest
trace
of
time
?
Show
then
,
sir
,
how
*NL*
much
is
to
be
done
,
both
to
sons
and
fathers
;
and
invite
all
wise
men
*NL*
to
become
like
yourself
,
and
other
men
to
become
wise
.
When
we
see
how
*NL*
cruel
statesmen
and
warriors
can
be
to
the
human
race
,
and
how
absurd
*NL*
distinguished
men
can
be
to
their
acquaintance
,
it
will
be
instructive
*NL*
to
observe
the
instances
multiply
of
pacific
,
acquiescing
manners
;
and
*NL*
to
find
how
compatible
it
is
to
be
great
and
domestic
,
enviable
and
yet
*NL*
good-humored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
private
incidents
which
you
will
also
have
to
relate
,
will
*NL*
have
considerable
use
,
as
we
want
,
above
all
things
,
rules
of
prudence
*NL*
in
ordinary
affairs
;
and
it
will
be
curious
to
see
how
you
have
acted
*NL*
in
these
.
It
will
be
so
far
a
sort
of
key
to
life
,
and
explain
many
*NL*
things
that
all
men
ought
to
have
once
explained
to
them
,
to
give
,
them
*NL*
a
chance
of
becoming
wise
by
foresight
.
The
nearest
thing
to
having
*NL*
experience
of
one
's
own
,
is
to
have
other
people
's
affairs
brought
*NL*
before
us
in
a
shape
that
is
interesting
;
this
is
sure
to
happen
from
*NL*
your
pen
;
our
affairs
and
management
will
have
an
air
of
simplicity
or
*NL*
importance
that
will
not
fail
to
strike
;
and
I
am
convinced
you
have
*NL*
conducted
them
with
as
much
originality
as
if
you
had
been
conducting
*NL*
discussions
in
politics
or
philosophy
;
and
what
more
worthy
of
*NL*
experiments
and
system
-LRB-
its
importance
and
its
errors
considered
-RRB-
than
*NL*
human
life
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
men
have
been
virtuous
blindly
,
others
have
speculated
*NL*
fantastically
,
and
others
have
been
shrewd
to
bad
purposes
;
but
you
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
am
sure
,
will
give
under
your
hand
,
nothing
but
what
is
at
the
*NL*
same
moment
,
wise
,
practical
and
good
,
your
account
of
yourself
-LRB-
for
I
*NL*
suppose
the
parallel
I
am
drawing
for
Dr.
Franklin
,
will
hold
not
only
*NL*
in
point
of
character
,
but
of
private
history
-RRB-
will
show
that
you
are
*NL*
ashamed
of
no
origin
;
a
thing
the
more
important
,
as
you
prove
how
*NL*
little
necessary
all
origin
is
to
happiness
,
virtue
,
or
greatness
.
As
*NL*
no
end
likewise
happens
without
a
means
,
so
we
shall
find
,
sir
,
that
*NL*
even
you
yourself
framed
a
plan
by
which
you
became
considerable
;
but
*NL*
at
the
same
time
we
may
see
that
though
the
event
is
flattering
,
the
*NL*
means
are
as
simple
as
wisdom
could
make
them
;
that
is
,
depending
upon
*NL*
nature
,
virtue
,
thought
and
habit
.
Another
thing
demonstrated
will
be
*NL*
the
propriety
of
everyman
's
waiting
for
his
time
for
appearing
upon
the
*NL*
stage
of
the
world
.
Our
sensations
being
very
much
fixed
to
the
*NL*
moment
,
we
are
apt
to
forget
that
more
moments
are
to
follow
the
first
,
*NL*
and
consequently
that
man
should
arrange
his
conduct
so
as
to
suit
the
*NL*
whole
of
a
life
.
Your
attribution
appears
to
have
been
applied
to
your
*NL*
life
,
and
the
passing
moments
of
it
have
been
enlivened
with
content
*NL*
and
enjoyment
instead
of
being
tormented
with
foolish
impatience
or
*NL*
regrets
.
Such
a
conduct
is
easy
for
those
who
make
virtue
and
*NL*
themselves
in
countenance
by
examples
of
other
truly
great
men
,
of
whom
*NL*
patience
is
so
often
the
characteristic
.
Your
Quaker
correspondent
,
*NL*
sir
-LRB-
for
here
again
I
will
suppose
the
subject
of
my
letter
resembling
*NL*
Dr.
Franklin
-RRB-
,
praised
your
frugality
,
diligence
and
temperance
,
which
*NL*
he
considered
as
a
pattern
for
all
youth
;
but
it
is
singular
that
he
*NL*
should
have
forgotten
your
modesty
and
your
disinterestedness
,
without
*NL*
which
you
never
could
have
waited
for
your
advancement
,
or
found
your
*NL*
situation
in
the
mean
time
comfortable
;
which
is
a
strong
lesson
to
*NL*
show
the
poverty
of
glory
and
the
importance
of
regulating
our
minds
.
*NL*
If
this
correspondent
had
known
the
nature
of
your
reputation
as
well
*NL*
as
I
do
,
he
would
have
said
,
Your
former
writings
and
measures
would
*NL*
secure
attention
to
your
Biography
,
and
Art
of
Virtue
;
and
your
*NL*
Biography
and
Art
of
Virtue
,
in
return
,
would
secure
attention
to
them
.
*NL*
This
is
an
advantage
attendant
upon
a
various
character
,
and
which
*NL*
brings
all
that
belongs
to
it
into
greater
play
;
and
it
is
the
more
*NL*
useful
,
as
perhaps
more
persons
are
at
a
loss
for
the
means
of
*NL*
improving
their
minds
and
characters
,
than
they
are
for
the
time
or
the
*NL*
inclination
to
do
it
.
But
there
is
one
concluding
reflection
,
sir
,
*NL*
that
will
shew
the
use
of
your
life
as
a
mere
piece
of
biography
.
This
*NL*
style
of
writing
seems
a
little
gone
out
of
vogue
,
and
yet
it
is
a
very
*NL*
useful
one
;
and
your
specimen
of
it
may
be
particularly
serviceable
,
as
*NL*
it
will
make
a
subject
of
comparison
with
the
lives
of
various
public
*NL*
cutthroats
and
intriguers
,
and
with
absurd
monastic
self-tormentors
or
*NL*
vain
literary
triflers
.
If
it
encourages
more
writings
of
the
same
*NL*
kind
with
your
own
,
and
induces
more
men
to
spend
lives
fit
to
be
*NL*
written
,
it
will
be
worth
all
Plutarch
's
Lives
put
together
.
But
being
*NL*
tired
of
figuring
to
myself
a
character
of
which
every
feature
suits
*NL*
only
one
man
in
the
world
,
without
giving
him
the
praise
of
it
,
I
shall
*NL*
end
my
letter
,
my
dear
Dr.
Franklin
,
with
a
personal
application
to
*NL*
your
proper
self
.
I
am
earnestly
desirous
,
then
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
you
*NL*
should
let
the
world
into
the
traits
of
your
genuine
character
,
as
*NL*
civil
broils
may
otherwise
tend
to
disguise
or
traduce
it
.
Considering
*NL*
your
great
age
,
the
caution
of
your
character
,
and
your
peculiar
style
*NL*
of
thinking
,
it
is
not
likely
that
any
one
besides
yourself
can
be
*NL*
sufficiently
master
of
the
facts
of
your
life
,
or
the
intentions
of
*NL*
your
mind
.
Besides
all
this
,
the
immense
revolution
of
the
present
*NL*
period
,
will
necessarily
turn
our
attention
towards
the
author
of
it
,
*NL*
and
when
virtuous
principles
have
been
pretended
in
it
,
it
will
be
*NL*
highly
important
to
shew
that
such
have
really
influenced
;
and
,
as
your
*NL*
own
character
will
be
the
principal
one
to
receive
a
scrutiny
,
it
is
*NL*
proper
-LRB-
even
for
its
effects
upon
your
vast
and
rising
country
,
as
well
*NL*
as
upon
England
and
upon
Europe
-RRB-
that
it
should
stand
respectable
and
*NL*
eternal
.
For
the
furtherance
of
human
happiness
,
I
have
always
*NL*
maintained
that
it
is
necessary
to
prove
that
man
is
not
even
at
*NL*
present
a
vicious
and
detestable
animal
;
and
still
more
to
prove
that
*NL*
good
management
may
greatly
amend
him
;
and
it
is
for
much
the
same
*NL*
reason
,
that
I
am
anxious
to
see
the
opinion
established
,
that
there
*NL*
are
fair
characters
existing
among
the
individuals
of
the
race
;
for
the
*NL*
moment
that
all
men
,
without
exception
,
shall
be
conceived
abandoned
,
*NL*
good
people
will
cease
efforts
deemed
to
be
hopeless
,
and
perhaps
think
*NL*
of
taking
their
share
in
the
scramble
of
life
,
or
at
least
of
making
it
*NL*
comfortable
principally
for
themselves
.
Take
then
,
my
dear
sir
,
this
*NL*
work
most
speedily
into
hand
:
shew
yourself
good
as
you
are
good
;
*NL*
temperate
as
you
are
temperate
;
and
above
all
things
,
prove
yourself
as
*NL*
one
,
who
from
your
infancy
have
loved
justice
,
liberty
and
concord
,
in
*NL*
a
way
that
has
made
it
natural
and
consistent
for
you
to
have
acted
,
as
*NL*
we
have
seen
you
act
in
the
last
seventeen
years
of
your
life
.
Let
*NL*
Englishmen
be
made
not
only
to
respect
,
but
even
to
love
you
.
When
*NL*
they
think
well
of
individuals
in
your
native
country
,
they
will
go
*NL*
nearer
to
thinking
well
of
your
country
;
and
when
your
countrymen
see
*NL*
themselves
well
thought
of
by
Englishmen
,
they
will
go
nearer
to
*NL*
thinking
well
of
England
.
Extend
your
views
even
further
;
do
not
stop
*NL*
at
those
who
speak
the
English
tongue
,
but
after
having
settled
so
many
*NL*
points
in
nature
and
politics
,
think
of
bettering
the
whole
race
of
*NL*
men
.
As
I
have
not
read
any
part
of
the
life
in
question
,
but
know
*NL*
only
the
character
that
lived
it
,
I
write
somewhat
at
hazard
.
I
am
*NL*
sure
,
however
,
that
the
life
and
the
treatise
I
allude
to
-LRB-
on
the
Art
*NL*
of
Virtue
-RRB-
will
necessarily
fulfil
the
chief
of
my
expectations
;
and
*NL*
still
more
so
if
you
take
up
the
measure
of
suiting
these
performances
*NL*
to
the
several
views
above
stated
.
Should
they
even
prove
unsuccessful
*NL*
in
all
that
a
sanguine
admirer
of
yours
hopes
from
them
,
you
will
at
*NL*
least
have
framed
pieces
to
interest
the
human
mind
;
and
whoever
gives
*NL*
a
feeling
of
pleasure
that
is
innocent
to
man
,
has
added
so
much
to
the
*NL*
fair
side
of
a
life
otherwise
too
much
darkened
by
anxiety
and
too
much
*NL*
injured
by
pain
.
In
the
hope
,
therefore
,
that
you
will
listen
to
the
*NL*
prayer
addressed
to
you
in
this
letter
,
I
beg
to
subscribe

Continuation
of
the
Account
of
my
Life
,
begun
at
Passy
,
near
Paris
,
*NL*
1784
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
some
time
since
I
receiv
'd
the
above
letters
,
but
I
have
been
too
*NL*
busy
till
now
to
think
of
complying
with
the
request
they
contain
.
It
*NL*
might
,
too
,
be
much
better
done
if
I
were
at
home
among
my
papers
,
*NL*
which
would
aid
my
memory
,
and
help
to
ascertain
dates
;
but
my
return
*NL*
being
uncertain
and
having
just
now
a
little
leisure
,
I
will
endeavor
*NL*
to
recollect
and
write
what
I
can
;
if
I
live
to
get
home
,
it
may
there
*NL*
be
corrected
and
improv
'd
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
having
any
copy
here
of
what
is
already
written
,
I
know
not
whether
*NL*
an
account
is
given
of
the
means
I
used
to
establish
the
Philadelphia
*NL*
public
library
,
which
,
from
a
small
beginning
,
is
now
become
so
*NL*
considerable
,
though
I
remember
to
have
come
down
to
near
the
time
of
*NL*
that
transaction
-LRB-
1730
-RRB-
.
I
will
therefore
begin
here
with
an
account
of
*NL*
it
,
which
may
be
struck
out
if
found
to
have
been
already
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
I
establish
'd
myself
in
Pennsylvania
,
there
was
not
a
good
*NL*
bookseller
's
shop
in
any
of
the
colonies
to
the
southward
of
Boston
.
*NL*
In
New
York
and
Philad
'
a
the
printers
were
indeed
stationers
;
they
sold
*NL*
only
paper
,
etc.
,
almanacs
,
ballads
,
and
a
few
common
school-books
.
*NL*
Those
who
lov
'd
reading
were
oblig
'd
to
send
for
their
books
from
*NL*
England
;
the
members
of
the
Junto
had
each
a
few
.
We
had
left
the
*NL*
alehouse
,
where
we
first
met
,
and
hired
a
room
to
hold
our
club
in
.
I
*NL*
propos
'd
that
we
should
all
of
us
bring
our
books
to
that
room
,
where
*NL*
they
would
not
only
be
ready
to
consult
in
our
conferences
,
but
become
*NL*
a
common
benefit
,
each
of
us
being
at
liberty
to
borrow
such
as
he
*NL*
wish
'd
to
read
at
home
.
This
was
accordingly
done
,
and
for
some
time
*NL*
contented
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
the
advantage
of
this
little
collection
,
I
propos
'd
to
render
*NL*
the
benefit
from
books
more
common
,
by
commencing
a
public
subscription
*NL*
library
.
I
drew
a
sketch
of
the
plan
and
rules
that
would
be
*NL*
necessary
,
and
got
a
skilful
conveyancer
,
Mr.
Charles
Brockden
,
to
put
*NL*
the
whole
in
form
of
articles
of
agreement
to
be
subscribed
,
by
which
*NL*
each
subscriber
engag
'd
to
pay
a
certain
sum
down
for
the
first
*NL*
purchase
of
books
,
and
an
annual
contribution
for
increasing
them
.
So
*NL*
few
were
the
readers
at
that
time
in
Philadelphia
,
and
the
majority
of
*NL*
us
so
poor
,
that
I
was
not
able
,
with
great
industry
,
to
find
more
than
*NL*
fifty
persons
,
mostly
young
tradesmen
,
willing
to
pay
down
for
this
*NL*
purpose
forty
shillings
each
,
and
ten
shillings
per
annum
.
On
this
*NL*
little
fund
we
began
.
The
books
were
imported
;
the
library
was
opened
*NL*
one
day
in
the
week
for
lending
to
the
subscribers
,
on
their
promissory
*NL*
notes
to
pay
double
the
value
if
not
duly
returned
.
The
institution
*NL*
soon
manifested
its
utility
,
was
imitated
by
other
towns
,
and
in
other
*NL*
provinces
.
The
libraries
were
augmented
by
donations
;
reading
became
*NL*
fashionable
;
and
our
people
,
having
no
publick
amusements
to
divert
*NL*
their
attention
from
study
,
became
better
acquainted
with
books
,
and
in
*NL*
a
few
years
were
observ
'd
by
strangers
to
be
better
instructed
and
more
*NL*
intelligent
than
people
of
the
same
rank
generally
are
in
other
*NL*
countries
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
about
to
sign
the
above-mentioned
articles
,
which
were
to
*NL*
be
binding
upon
us
,
our
heirs
,
etc.
,
for
fifty
years
,
Mr.
Brockden
,
the
*NL*
scrivener
,
said
to
us
,
``
You
are
young
men
,
but
it
is
scarcely
probable
*NL*
that
any
of
you
will
live
to
see
the
expiration
of
the
term
fix
'd
in
*NL*
the
instrument
.
''
A
number
of
us
,
however
,
are
yet
living
;
but
the
*NL*
instrument
was
after
a
few
years
rendered
null
by
a
charter
that
*NL*
incorporated
and
gave
perpetuity
to
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
objections
and
reluctances
I
met
with
in
soliciting
the
*NL*
subscriptions
,
made
me
soon
feel
the
impropriety
of
presenting
one
's
*NL*
self
as
the
proposer
of
any
useful
project
,
that
might
be
suppos
'd
to
*NL*
raise
one
's
reputation
in
the
smallest
degree
above
that
of
one
's
*NL*
neighbors
,
when
one
has
need
of
their
assistance
to
accomplish
that
*NL*
project
.
I
therefore
put
myself
as
much
as
I
could
out
of
sight
,
and
*NL*
stated
it
as
a
scheme
of
a
number
of
friends
,
who
had
requested
me
to
*NL*
go
about
and
propose
it
to
such
as
they
thought
lovers
of
reading
.
In
*NL*
this
way
my
affair
went
on
more
smoothly
,
and
I
ever
after
practis
'd
it
*NL*
on
such
occasions
;
and
,
from
my
frequent
successes
,
can
heartily
*NL*
recommend
it
.
The
present
little
sacrifice
of
your
vanity
will
*NL*
afterwards
be
amply
repaid
.
If
it
remains
a
while
uncertain
to
whom
*NL*
the
merit
belongs
,
some
one
more
vain
than
yourself
will
be
encouraged
*NL*
to
claim
it
,
and
then
even
envy
will
be
disposed
to
do
you
justice
by
*NL*
plucking
those
assumed
feathers
,
and
restoring
them
to
their
right
*NL*
owner
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
library
afforded
me
the
means
of
improvement
by
constant
study
,
*NL*
for
which
I
set
apart
an
hour
or
two
each
day
,
and
thus
repair
'd
in
*NL*
some
degree
the
loss
of
the
learned
education
my
father
once
intended
*NL*
for
me
.
Reading
was
the
only
amusement
I
allow
'd
myself
.
I
spent
no
*NL*
time
in
taverns
,
games
,
or
frolicks
of
any
kind
;
and
my
industry
in
my
*NL*
business
continu
'd
as
indefatigable
as
it
was
necessary
.
I
was
*NL*
indebted
for
my
printing-house
;
I
had
a
young
family
coming
on
to
be
*NL*
educated
,
and
I
had
to
contend
with
for
business
two
printers
,
who
were
*NL*
established
in
the
place
before
me
.
My
circumstances
,
however
,
grew
*NL*
daily
easier
.
My
original
habits
of
frugality
continuing
,
and
my
*NL*
father
having
,
among
his
instructions
to
me
when
a
boy
,
frequently
*NL*
repeated
a
proverb
of
Solomon
,
``
Seest
thou
a
man
diligent
in
his
*NL*
calling
,
he
shall
stand
before
kings
,
he
shall
not
stand
before
mean
*NL*
men
,
''
I
from
thence
considered
industry
as
a
means
of
obtaining
wealth
*NL*
and
distinction
,
which
encourag
'd
me
,
tho
'
I
did
not
think
that
I
*NL*
should
ever
literally
stand
before
kings
,
which
,
however
,
has
since
*NL*
happened
;
for
I
have
stood
before
five
,
and
even
had
the
honor
of
*NL*
sitting
down
with
one
,
the
King
of
Denmark
,
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
an
English
proverb
that
says
,
``
He
that
would
thrive
,
must
ask
*NL*
his
wife
.
''
It
was
lucky
for
me
that
I
had
one
as
much
dispos
'd
to
*NL*
industry
and
frugality
as
myself
.
She
assisted
me
cheerfully
in
my
*NL*
business
,
folding
and
stitching
pamphlets
,
tending
shop
,
purchasing
old
*NL*
linen
rags
for
the
papermakers
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
We
kept
no
idle
servants
,
*NL*
our
table
was
plain
and
simple
,
our
furniture
of
the
cheapest
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
my
breakfast
was
a
long
time
bread
and
milk
-LRB-
no
tea
-RRB-
,
and
I
*NL*
ate
it
out
of
a
twopenny
earthen
porringer
,
with
a
pewter
spoon
.
But
*NL*
mark
how
luxury
will
enter
families
,
and
make
a
progress
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
principle
:
being
call
'd
one
morning
to
breakfast
,
I
found
it
in
a
*NL*
China
bowl
,
with
a
spoon
of
silver
!
They
had
been
bought
for
me
*NL*
without
my
knowledge
by
my
wife
,
and
had
cost
her
the
enormous
sum
of
*NL*
three-and-twenty
shillings
,
for
which
she
had
no
other
excuse
or
*NL*
apology
to
make
,
but
that
she
thought
her
husband
deserv
'd
a
silver
*NL*
spoon
and
China
bowl
as
well
as
any
of
his
neighbors
.
This
was
the
*NL*
first
appearance
of
plate
and
China
in
our
house
,
which
afterward
,
in
a
*NL*
course
of
years
,
as
our
wealth
increas
'd
,
augmented
gradually
to
*NL*
several
hundred
pounds
in
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
religiously
educated
as
a
Presbyterian
;
and
tho
'
some
of
the
*NL*
dogmas
of
that
persuasion
,
such
as
the
eternal
decrees
of
God
,
*NL*
election
,
reprobation
,
etc.
,
appeared
to
me
unintelligible
,
others
*NL*
doubtful
,
and
I
early
absented
myself
from
the
public
assemblies
of
the
*NL*
sect
,
Sunday
being
my
studying
day
,
I
never
was
without
some
religious
*NL*
principles
.
I
never
doubted
,
for
instance
,
the
existence
of
the
Deity
;
*NL*
that
he
made
the
world
,
and
govern
'd
it
by
his
Providence
;
that
the
*NL*
most
acceptable
service
of
God
was
the
doing
good
to
man
;
that
our
*NL*
souls
are
immortal
;
and
that
all
crime
will
be
punished
,
and
virtue
*NL*
rewarded
,
either
here
or
hereafter
.
These
I
esteem
'd
the
essentials
of
*NL*
every
religion
;
and
,
being
to
be
found
in
all
the
religions
we
had
in
*NL*
our
country
,
I
respected
them
all
,
tho
'
with
different
degrees
of
*NL*
respect
,
as
I
found
them
more
or
less
mix
'd
with
other
articles
,
which
,
*NL*
without
any
tendency
to
inspire
,
promote
,
or
confirm
morality
,
serv
'd
*NL*
principally
to
divide
us
,
and
make
us
unfriendly
to
one
another
.
This
*NL*
respect
to
all
,
with
an
opinion
that
the
worst
had
some
good
effects
,
*NL*
induc
'd
me
to
avoid
all
discourse
that
might
tend
to
lessen
the
good
*NL*
opinion
another
might
have
of
his
own
religion
;
and
as
our
province
*NL*
increas
'd
in
people
,
and
new
places
of
worship
were
continually
wanted
,
*NL*
and
generally
erected
by
voluntary
contributions
,
my
mite
for
such
*NL*
purpose
,
whatever
might
be
the
sect
,
was
never
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tho
'
I
seldom
attended
any
public
worship
,
I
had
still
an
opinion
of
*NL*
its
propriety
,
and
of
its
utility
when
rightly
conducted
,
and
I
*NL*
regularly
paid
my
annual
subscription
for
the
support
of
the
only
*NL*
Presbyterian
minister
or
meeting
we
had
in
Philadelphia
.
He
us
'd
to
*NL*
visit
me
sometimes
as
a
friend
,
and
admonish
me
to
attend
his
*NL*
administrations
,
and
I
was
now
and
then
prevail
'd
on
to
do
so
,
once
for
*NL*
five
Sundays
successively
.
Had
he
been
in
my
opinion
a
good
preacher
,
*NL*
perhaps
I
might
have
continued
,
notwithstanding
the
occasion
I
had
for
*NL*
the
Sunday
's
leisure
in
my
course
of
study
;
but
his
discourses
were
*NL*
chiefly
either
polemic
arguments
,
or
explications
of
the
peculiar
*NL*
doctrines
of
our
sect
,
and
were
all
to
me
very
dry
,
uninteresting
,
and
*NL*
unedifying
,
since
not
a
single
moral
principle
was
inculcated
or
*NL*
enforc
'd
,
their
aim
seeming
to
be
rather
to
make
us
Presbyterians
than
*NL*
good
citizens
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
took
for
his
text
that
verse
of
the
fourth
chapter
of
*NL*
Philippians
,
``
Finally
,
brethren
,
whatsoever
things
are
true
,
honest
,
*NL*
just
,
pure
,
lovely
,
or
of
good
report
,
if
there
be
any
virtue
,
or
any
*NL*
praise
,
think
on
these
things
.
''
And
I
imagin
'd
,
in
a
sermon
on
such
a
*NL*
text
,
we
could
not
miss
of
having
some
morality
.
But
he
confin
'd
*NL*
himself
to
five
points
only
,
as
meant
by
the
apostle
,
viz.
:
1
.
Keeping
*NL*
holy
the
Sabbath
day
.
2
.
Being
diligent
in
reading
the
holy
*NL*
Scriptures
.
3
.
Attending
duly
the
publick
worship
.
4
.
Partaking
of
*NL*
the
Sacrament
.
5
.
Paying
a
due
respect
to
God
's
ministers
.
These
*NL*
might
be
all
good
things
;
but
,
as
they
were
not
the
kind
of
good
things
*NL*
that
I
expected
from
that
text
,
I
despaired
of
ever
meeting
with
them
*NL*
from
any
other
,
was
disgusted
,
and
attended
his
preaching
no
more
.
I
*NL*
had
some
years
before
compos
'd
a
little
Liturgy
,
or
form
of
prayer
,
for
*NL*
my
own
private
use
-LRB-
viz.
,
in
1728
-RRB-
,
entitled
,
Articles
of
Belief
and
*NL*
Acts
of
Religion
.
I
return
'd
to
the
use
of
this
,
and
went
no
more
to
*NL*
the
public
assemblies
.
My
conduct
might
be
blameable
,
but
I
leave
it
,
*NL*
without
attempting
further
to
excuse
it
;
my
present
purpose
being
to
*NL*
relate
facts
,
and
not
to
make
apologies
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
this
time
I
conceiv
'd
the
bold
and
arduous
project
of
*NL*
arriving
at
moral
perfection
.
I
wish
'd
to
live
without
committing
any
*NL*
fault
at
any
time
;
I
would
conquer
all
that
either
natural
inclination
,
*NL*
custom
,
or
company
might
lead
me
into
.
As
I
knew
,
or
thought
I
knew
,
*NL*
what
was
right
and
wrong
,
I
did
not
see
why
I
might
not
always
do
the
*NL*
one
and
avoid
the
other
.
But
I
soon
found
I
had
undertaken
a
task
of
*NL*
more
difficulty
than
I
had
imagined
.
While
my
care
was
employ
'd
in
*NL*
guarding
against
one
fault
,
I
was
often
surprised
by
another
;
habit
*NL*
took
the
advantage
of
inattention
;
inclination
was
sometimes
too
strong
*NL*
for
reason
.
I
concluded
,
at
length
,
that
the
mere
speculative
*NL*
conviction
that
it
was
our
interest
to
be
completely
virtuous
,
was
not
*NL*
sufficient
to
prevent
our
slipping
;
and
that
the
contrary
habits
must
*NL*
be
broken
,
and
good
ones
acquired
and
established
,
before
we
can
have
*NL*
any
dependence
on
a
steady
,
uniform
rectitude
of
conduct
.
For
this
*NL*
purpose
I
therefore
contrived
the
following
method
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
various
enumerations
of
the
moral
virtues
I
had
met
with
in
my
*NL*
reading
,
I
found
the
catalogue
more
or
less
numerous
,
as
different
*NL*
writers
included
more
or
fewer
ideas
under
the
same
name
.
Temperance
,
*NL*
for
example
,
was
by
some
confined
to
eating
and
drinking
,
while
by
*NL*
others
it
was
extended
to
mean
the
moderating
every
other
pleasure
,
*NL*
appetite
,
inclination
,
or
passion
,
bodily
or
mental
,
even
to
our
*NL*
avarice
and
ambition
.
I
propos
'd
to
myself
,
for
the
sake
of
clearness
,
*NL*
to
use
rather
more
names
,
with
fewer
ideas
annex
'd
to
each
,
than
a
few
*NL*
names
with
more
ideas
;
and
I
included
under
thirteen
names
of
virtues
*NL*
all
that
at
that
time
occurr
'd
to
me
as
necessary
or
desirable
,
and
*NL*
annexed
to
each
a
short
precept
,
which
fully
express
'd
the
extent
I
*NL*
gave
to
its
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
names
of
virtues
,
with
their
precepts
,
were
:
*NL*
*NL*
1
.
TEMPERANCE

to

.

all
your
things
have
their
places
;
let
each
part
of

your
business
have
its
time

*NL*
*NL*
4
.
RESOLUTION
.
Resolve
to
perform

*NL*
5
.
FRUGALITY
.
Make
no
expense
but

.

.

you
think
they
deserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
10
.
CLEANLINESS

Tolerate
no
uncleanliness
in
body
,
cloaths
,
or
*NL*

.
*NL*
*NL*

.
HUMILITY

Imitate
Jesus
and
Socrates

*NL*
*NL*
My
intention
being
to
acquire
the
habitude
of
all
these
virtues
,
I
*NL*
judg
'd
it
would
be
well
not
to
distract
my
attention
by
attempting
the
*NL*
whole
at
once
,
but
to
fix
it
on
one
of
them
at
a
time
;
and
,
when
I
*NL*
should
be
master
of
that
,
then
to
proceed
to
another
,
and
so
on
,
till
I
*NL*
should
have
gone
thro
'
the
thirteen
;
and
,
as
the
previous
acquisition
*NL*
of
some
might
facilitate
the
acquisition
of
certain
others
,
I
arrang
'd
*NL*
them
with
that
view
,
as
they
stand
above
.
Temperance
first
,
as
it
*NL*
tends
to
procure
that
coolness
and
clearness
of
head
,
which
is
so
*NL*
necessary
where
constant
vigilance
was
to
be
kept
up
,
and
guard
*NL*
maintained
against
the
unremitting
attraction
of
ancient
habits
,
and
*NL*
the
force
of
perpetual
temptations
.
This
being
acquir
'd
and
*NL*
establish
'd
,
Silence
would
be
more
easy
;
and
my
desire
being
to
gain
*NL*
knowledge
at
the
same
time
that
I
improv
'd
in
virtue
,
and
considering
*NL*
that
in
conversation
it
was
obtain
'd
rather
by
the
use
of
the
ears
than
*NL*
of
the
tongue
,
and
therefore
wishing
to
break
a
habit
I
was
getting
*NL*
into
of
prattling
,
punning
,
and
joking
,
which
only
made
me
acceptable
*NL*
to
trifling
company
,
I
gave
Silence
the
second
place
.
This
and
the
*NL*
next
,
Order
,
I
expected
would
allow
me
more
time
for
attending
to
my
*NL*
project
and
my
studies
.
Resolution
,
once
become
habitual
,
would
keep
*NL*
me
firm
in
my
endeavors
to
obtain
all
the
subsequent
virtues
;
Frugality
*NL*
and
Industry
freeing
me
from
my
remaining
debt
,
and
producing
affluence
*NL*
and
independence
,
would
make
more
easy
the
practice
of
Sincerity
and
*NL*
Justice
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
Conceiving
then
,
that
,
agreeably
to
the
advice
of
*NL*
Pythagoras
in
his
Golden
Verses
,
daily
examination
would
be
necessary
,
*NL*
I
contrived
the
following
method
for
conducting
that
examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
a
little
book
,
in
which
I
allotted
a
page
for
each
of
the
*NL*
virtues
.
I
rul
'd
each
page
with
red
ink
,
so
as
to
have
seven
columns
,
*NL*
one
for
each
day
of
the
week
,
marking
each
column
with
a
letter
for
the
*NL*
day
.
I
cross
'd
these
columns
with
thirteen
red
lines
,
marking
the
*NL*
beginning
of
each
line
with
the
first
letter
of
one
of
the
virtues
,
on
*NL*
which
line
,
and
in
its
proper
column
,
I
might
mark
,
by
a
little
black
*NL*
spot
,
every
fault
I
found
upon
examination
to
have
been
committed
*NL*
respecting
that
virtue
upon
that
day
.

I
determined
to
give
a
week
's
strict
attention
to
each
of
the
virtues
*NL*
successively
.
Thus
,
in
the
first
week
,
my
great
guard
was
to
avoid
*NL*
every
the
least
offence
against
Temperance
,
leaving
the
other
virtues
*NL*
to
their
ordinary
chance
,
only
marking
every
evening
the
faults
of
the
*NL*
day
.
Thus
,
if
in
the
first
week
I
could
keep
my
first
line
,
marked
T
,
*NL*
clear
of
spots
,
I
suppos
'd
the
habit
of
that
virtue
so
much
*NL*
strengthen
'd
and
its
opposite
weaken
'd
,
that
I
might
venture
extending
*NL*
my
attention
to
include
the
next
,
and
for
the
following
week
keep
both
*NL*
lines
clear
of
spots
.
Proceeding
thus
to
the
last
,
I
could
go
thro
'
a
*NL*
course
compleat
in
thirteen
weeks
,
and
four
courses
in
a
year
.
And
*NL*
like
him
who
,
having
a
garden
to
weed
,
does
not
attempt
to
eradicate
*NL*
all
the
bad
herbs
at
once
,
which
would
exceed
his
reach
and
his
*NL*
strength
,
but
works
on
one
of
the
beds
at
a
time
,
and
,
having
*NL*
accomplish
'd
the
first
,
proceeds
to
a
second
,
so
I
should
have
,
I
*NL*
hoped
,
the
encouraging
pleasure
of
seeing
on
my
pages
the
progress
I
*NL*
made
in
virtue
,
by
clearing
successively
my
lines
of
their
spots
,
till
*NL*
in
the
end
,
by
a
number
of
courses
,
I
should
be
happy
in
viewing
a
*NL*
clean
book
,
after
a
thirteen
weeks
'
daily
examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
my
little
book
had
for
its
motto
these
lines
from
Addison
's
Cato
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
will
I
hold
.
If
there
's
a
power
above
us
*NL*
-LRB-
And
that
there
is
all
nature
cries
aloud
*NL*
Thro
'
all
her
works
-RRB-
,
He
must
delight
in
virtue
;
*NL*
And
that
which
he
delights
in
must
be
happy
.

from

Another
from
the
Proverbs
of
Solomon
,
speaking
of
wisdom
or
virtue
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Length
of

is
in
her
right
hand
,
and
in
her
left
hand
*NL*
riches
and
honour
.
Her
ways
are
ways
of
pleasantness
,
*NL*
and
all
her
paths
are
peace
.

*NL*
*NL*
And
conceiving
God
to
be
the
fountain
of
wisdom
,
I
thought
it
right
and
*NL*
necessary
to
solicit
his
assistance
for
obtaining
it
;
to
this
end
I
*NL*
formed
the
following
little
prayer
,
which
was
prefix
'd
to
my
tables
of
*NL*
examination
,
for
daily
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
powerful
Goodness
!
bountiful
Father
!
merciful
Guide
!
increase
in
me
*NL*
that
wisdom
which
discovers
my
truest
interest
!
strengthen
my
*NL*
resolutions
to
perform
what
that
wisdom
dictates
.
Accept
my
kind
*NL*
offices
to
thy
other
children
as
the
only
return
in
my
power
for
thy
*NL*
continual
favors
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
used
also
sometimes
a
little
prayer
which
I
took
from
Thomson
's
*NL*
Poems
,
viz.
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
of
light
and
life
,
thou
Good
Supreme
!
*NL*
O
teach
me
what
is
good
;
teach
me
Thyself
!
*NL*
Save
me
from
folly
,
vanity
,
and
vice
,
*NL*
From
every
low
pursuit
;
and
fill
my
soul
*NL*
With
knowledge
,
conscious
peace
,
and
virtue
pure
;
*NL*
Sacred
,
substantial
,
never-fading
bliss
!

I
enter
'd
upon
the
execution
of
this
plan
for
self-examination
,
and
*NL*
continu
'd
it
with
occasional
intermissions
for
some
time
.
I
was
*NL*
surpris
'd
to
find
myself
so
much
fuller
of
faults
than
I
had
imagined
;
*NL*
but
I
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
diminish
.
To
avoid
the
*NL*
trouble
of
renewing
now
and
then
my
little
book
,
which
,
by
scraping
out
*NL*
the
marks
on
the
paper
of
old
faults
to
make
room
for
new
ones
in
a
new
*NL*
course
,
became
full
of
holes
,
I
transferr
'd
my
tables
and
precepts
to
*NL*
the
ivory
leaves
of
a
memorandum
book
,
on
which
the
lines
were
drawn
*NL*
with
red
ink
,
that
made
a
durable
stain
,
and
on
those
lines
I
mark
'd
my
*NL*
faults
with
a
black-lead
pencil
,
which
marks
I
could
easily
wipe
out
*NL*
with
a
wet
sponge
.
After
a
while
I
went
thro
'
one
course
only
in
a
*NL*
year
,
and
afterward
only
one
in
several
years
,
till
at
length
I
omitted
*NL*
them
entirely
,
being
employ
'd
in
voyages
and
business
abroad
,
with
a
*NL*
multiplicity
of
affairs
that
interfered
;
but
I
always
carried
my
little
*NL*
book
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
scheme
of
ORDER
gave
me
the
most
trouble
;
and
I
found
that
,
tho
'
it
*NL*
might
be
practicable
where
a
man
's
business
was
such
as
to
leave
him
*NL*
the
disposition
of
his
time
,
that
of
a
journeyman
printer
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
it
was
not
possible
to
be
exactly
observed
by
a
master
,
who
*NL*
must
mix
with
the
world
,
and
often
receive
people
of
business
at
their
*NL*
own
hours
.
Order
,
too
,
with
regard
to
places
for
things
,
papers
,
etc.
,
*NL*
I
found
extreamly
difficult
to
acquire
.
I
had
not
been
early
*NL*
accustomed
to
it
,
and
,
having
an
exceeding
good
memory
,
I
was
not
so
*NL*
sensible
of
the
inconvenience
attending
want
of
method
.
This
article
,
*NL*
therefore
,
cost
me
so
much
painful
attention
,
and
my
faults
in
it
vexed
*NL*
me
so
much
,
and
I
made
so
little
progress
in
amendment
,
and
had
such
*NL*
frequent
relapses
,
that
I
was
almost
ready
to
give
up
the
attempt
,
and
*NL*
content
myself
with
a
faulty
character
in
that
respect
,
like
the
man
*NL*
who
,
in
buying
an
ax
of
a
smith
,
my
neighbour
,
desired
to
have
the
*NL*
whole
of
its
surface
as
bright
as
the
edge
.
The
smith
consented
to
*NL*
grind
it
bright
for
him
if
he
would
turn
the
wheel
;
he
turn
'd
,
while
*NL*
the
smith
press
'd
the
broad
face
of
the
ax
hard
and
heavily
on
the
*NL*
stone
,
which
made
the
turning
of
it
very
fatiguing
.
The
man
came
every
*NL*
now
and
then
from
the
wheel
to
see
how
the
work
went
on
,
and
at
length
*NL*
would
take
his
ax
as
it
was
,
without
farther
grinding
.
``
No
,
''
said
the
*NL*
smith
,
``
turn
on
,
turn
on
;
we
shall
have
it
bright
by-and-by
;
as
yet
,
it
*NL*
is
only
speckled
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
but
I
think
I
like
a
speckled
*NL*
ax
best
.
''
And
I
believe
this
may
have
been
the
case
with
many
,
who
,
*NL*
having
,
for
want
of
some
such
means
as
I
employ
'd
,
found
the
difficulty
*NL*
of
obtaining
good
and
breaking
bad
habits
in
other
points
of
vice
and
*NL*
virtue
,
have
given
up
the
struggle
,
and
concluded
that
``
a
speckled
ax
*NL*
was
best
''
;
for
something
,
that
pretended
to
be
reason
,
was
every
now
*NL*
and
then
suggesting
to
me
that
such
extream
nicety
as
I
exacted
of
*NL*
myself
might
be
a
kind
of
foppery
in
morals
,
which
,
if
it
were
known
,
*NL*
would
make
me
ridiculous
;
that
a
perfect
character
might
be
attended
*NL*
with
the
inconvenience
of
being
envied
and
hated
;
and
that
a
benevolent
*NL*
man
should
allow
a
few
faults
in
himself
,
to
keep
his
friends
in
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
,
I
found
myself
incorrigible
with
respect
to
Order
;
and
now
I
*NL*
am
grown
old
,
and
my
memory
bad
,
I
feel
very
sensibly
the
want
of
it
.
*NL*
But
,
on
the
whole
,
tho
'
I
never
arrived
at
the
perfection
I
had
been
so
*NL*
ambitious
of
obtaining
,
but
fell
far
short
of
it
,
yet
I
was
,
by
the
*NL*
endeavour
,
a
better
and
a
happier
man
than
I
otherwise
should
have
been
*NL*
if
I
had
not
attempted
it
;
as
those
who
aim
at
perfect
writing
by
*NL*
imitating
the
engraved
copies
,
tho
'
they
never
reach
the
wish
'd
-
for
*NL*
excellence
of
those
copies
,
their
hand
is
mended
by
the
endeavor
,
and
*NL*
is
tolerable
while
it
continues
fair
and
legible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
well
my
posterity
should
be
informed
that
to
this
little
*NL*
artifice
,
with
the
blessing
of
God
,
their
ancestor
ow
'd
the
constant
*NL*
felicity
of
his
life
,
down
to
his
79th
year
,
in
which
this
is
written
.
*NL*
What
reverses
may
attend
the
remainder
is
in
the

,
if
they
arrive
,
the
reflection
on
past
happiness
enjoy
'd
ought
to
*NL*
help
his
bearing
them
with
more
resignation
.
To
Temperance
he
ascribes
*NL*
his
long-continued
health
,
and
what
is
still
left
to
him
of
a
good
*NL*
constitution
;
to
Industry
and
Frugality
,
the
early
easiness
of
his
*NL*
circumstances
and
acquisition
of
his
fortune
,
with
all
that
knowledge
*NL*
that
enabled
him
to
be
a
useful
citizen
,
and
obtained
for
him
some
*NL*
degree
of
reputation
among
the
learned
;
to
Sincerity
and
Justice
,
the
*NL*
confidence
of
his
country
,
and
the
honorable
employs
it
conferred
upon
*NL*
him
;
and
to
the
joint
influence
of
the
whole
mass
of
the
virtues
,
even
*NL*
in
the
imperfect
state
he
was
able
to
acquire
them
,
all
that
evenness
*NL*
of
temper
,
and
that
cheerfulness
in
conversation
,
which
makes
his
*NL*
company
still
sought
for
,
and
agreeable
even
to
his
younger
*NL*
acquaintance
.
I
hope
,
therefore
,
that
some
of
my
descendants
may
*NL*
follow
the
example
and
reap
the
benefit
.

*NL*
It
will
be
remark
'd
that
,
tho
'
my
scheme
was
not
wholly
without
*NL*
religion
,
there
was
in
it
no
mark
of
any
of
the
distinguishing
tenets
*NL*
of
any
particular
sect
.
I
had
purposely
avoided
them
;
for
,
being
fully
*NL*
persuaded
of
the
utility
and
excellency
of
my
method
,
and
that
it
might
*NL*
be
serviceable
to
people
in
all
religions
,
and
intending
some
time
or
*NL*
other
to
publish
it
,
I
would
not
have
any
thing
in
it
that
should
*NL*
prejudice
any
one
,
of
any
sect
,
against
it
.
I
purposed
writing
a
*NL*
little
comment
on
each
virtue
,
in
which
I
would
have
shown
the
*NL*
advantages
of
possessing
it
,
and
the
mischiefs
attending
its
opposite
*NL*
vice
;
and
I
should
have
called
my
book
THE
ART
OF
VIRTUE
,
-LSB-

-RSB-
because
it
*NL*
would
have
shown
the
means
and
manner
of
obtaining
virtue
,
which
would
*NL*
have
distinguished
it
from
the
mere
exhortation
to
be
good
,
that
does
*NL*
not
instruct
and
indicate
the
means
,
but
is
like
the
apostle
's
man
of
*NL*
verbal
charity
,
who
only
without
showing
to
the
naked
and
hungry
how
or
*NL*
where
they
might
get
clothes
or
victuals
,
exhorted
them
to
be
fed
and

clothed

But
it
so
happened
that
my
intention
of
writing
and
publishing
this
*NL*

was
never
fulfilled
.
I
did
,
indeed
,
from
time
to

,
put
*NL*
down
short
hints
of
the
sentiments
,
reasonings
,
etc.
,
to
be
made
use
of
*NL*
in
it
,
some
of
which
I
have
still
by
me
;
but
the
necessary
close
*NL*
attention
to
private
business
in
the
earlier
part
of
thy
life
,
and
*NL*
public
business
since
,
have
occasioned
my
postponing
it
;
for
,
it
being
*NL*
connected
in
my
mind
with
a
great
and
extensive
project
,
that
required
*NL*
the
whole
man
to
execute
,
and
which
an
unforeseen
succession
of
employs
*NL*
prevented
my
attending
to
,
it
has
hitherto
remain
'd
unfinish
'd
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
piece
it
was
my
design
to
explain
and
enforce
this
doctrine
,
*NL*
that
vicious
actions
are
not
hurtful
because
they
are
forbidden
,
but
*NL*
forbidden
because
they
are
hurtful
,
the
nature
of
man
alone
considered
;
*NL*
that
it
was
,
therefore
,
every
one
's
interest
to
be
virtuous
who
wish
'd
*NL*
to
be
happy
even
in
this
world
;
and
I
should
,
from
this
circumstance
*NL*
-LRB-
there
being
always
in
the
world
a
number
of
rich
merchants
,
nobility
,
*NL*
states
,
and
princes
,
who
have
need
of
honest
instruments
for
the
*NL*
management
of
their
affairs
,
and
such
being
so
rare
-RRB-
,
have
endeavored
*NL*
to
convince
young
persons
that
no
qualities
were
so
likely
to
make
a
*NL*
poor
man
's
fortune
as
those
of
probity
and
integrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
list
of
virtues
contain
'd
at
first
but
twelve
;
but
a
Quaker
friend
*NL*
having
kindly
informed
me
that
I
was
generally
thought
proud
;
that
my
*NL*
pride
show
'd
itself
frequently
in
conversation
;
that
I
was
not
content
*NL*
with
being
in
the
right
when
discussing
any
point
,
but
was
overbearing
,
*NL*
and
rather
insolent
,
of
which
he
convinc
'd
me
by
mentioning
several
*NL*
instances
;
I
determined
endeavouring
to
cure
myself
,
if
I
could
,
of
*NL*
this
vice
or
folly
among
the
rest
,
and
I
added
Humility
to
my
list
,
*NL*
giving
an
extensive
meaning
to
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
boast
of
much
success
in
acquiring
the
reality
of
this
virtue
,
*NL*
but
I
had
a
good
deal
with
regard
to
the
appearance
of
it
.
I
made
it
a
*NL*
rule
to
forbear
all
direct
contradiction
to
the
sentiments
of
others
,
*NL*
and
all
positive
assertion
of
my
own
.
I
even
forbid
myself
,
agreeably
*NL*
to
the
old
laws
of
our
Junto
,
the
use
of
every
word
or
expression
in
*NL*
the
language
that
imported
a
fix
'd
opinion
,
such
as
certainly
,
*NL*
undoubtedly
,
etc.
,
and
I
adopted
,
instead
of
them
,
I
conceive
,
I
*NL*
apprehend
,
or
I
imagine
a
thing
to
be
so
or
so
;
or
it
so
appears
to
me
*NL*
at
present
.
When
another
asserted
something
that
I
thought
an
error
,
I
*NL*
deny
'd
myself
the
pleasure
of
contradicting
him
abruptly
,
and
of
*NL*
showing
immediately
some
absurdity
in
his
proposition
;
and
in
answering
*NL*
I
began
by
observing
that
in
certain
cases
or
circumstances
his
opinion
*NL*
would
be
right
,
but
in
the
present
case
there
appear
'd
or
seem
'd
to
me
*NL*
some
difference
,
etc.
.
I
soon
found
the
advantage
of
this
change
in
my
*NL*
manner
;
the
conversations
I
engag
'd
in
went
on
more
pleasantly
.
The
*NL*
modest
way
in
which
I
propos
'd
my
opinions
procur
'd
them
a
readier
*NL*
reception
and
less
contradiction
;
I
had
less
mortification
when
I
was
*NL*
found
to
be
in
the
wrong
,
and
I
more
easily
prevail
'd
with
others
to
*NL*
give
up
their
mistakes
and
join
with
me
when
I
happened
to
be
in
the
*NL*
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
mode
,
which
I
at
first
put
on
with
some
violence
to
natural
*NL*
inclination
,
became
at
length
so
easy
,
and
so
habitual
to
me
,
that
*NL*
perhaps
for
these
fifty
years
past
no
one
has
ever
heard
a
dogmatical
*NL*
expression
escape
me
.
And
to
this
habit
-LRB-
after
my
character
of
*NL*
integrity
-RRB-
I
think
it
principally
owing
that
I
had
early
so
much
weight
*NL*
with
my
fellow-citizens
when
I
proposed
new
institutions
,
or
*NL*
alterations
in
the
old
,
and
so
much
influence
in
public
councils
when
I
*NL*
became
a
member
;
for
I
was
but
a
bad
speaker
,
never
eloquent
,
subject
*NL*
to
much
hesitation
in
my
choice
of
words
,
hardly
correct
in
language
,
*NL*
and
yet
I
generally
carried
my
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
,
there
is
,
perhaps
,
no
one
of
our
natural
passions
so
hard
*NL*
to
subdue
as
pride
.
Disguise
it
,
struggle
with
it
,
beat
it
down
,
*NL*
stifle
it
,
mortify
it
as
much
as
one
pleases
,
it
is
still
alive
,
and
*NL*
will
every
now
and
then
peep
out
and
show
itself
;
you
will
see
it
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
often
in
this
history
;
for
,
even
if
I
could
conceive
that
I
*NL*
had
compleatly
overcome
it
,
I
should
probably
be
proud
of
my
humility

HAVING

here

of

Its

on
pieces

such
thoughts
as
occurr

to
me

respecting
it

Most
of
these
are
lost

I
find
one
purporting

the
substance

an
intended
creed

containing

I
thought

the
*NL*
essentials
of
every
known

being
free

shock

is
express

in

*NL*
``

My

were

that

spread
at

first
among

;
that
each
person
to
be
initiated

should
not
only
declare
his
assent
to
such
creed
,
but
should
have
*NL*
exercised
himself
with
the
thirteen
weeks
'
examination
and
practice
of
*NL*
the
virtues
,
as
in
the
before-mention
'd
model
;
that
the
existence
of
*NL*
such
a
society
should
be
kept
a
secret
,
till
it
was
become
*NL*
considerable
,
to
prevent
solicitations
for
the
admission
of
improper
*NL*
persons
,
but
that
the
members
should
each
of
them
search
among
his
*NL*
acquaintance
for
ingenuous
,
well-disposed
youths
,
to
whom
,
with
prudent
*NL*
caution
,
the
scheme
should
be
gradually
communicated
;
that
the
members
*NL*
should
engage
to
afford
their
advice
,
assistance
,
and
support
to
each
*NL*
other
in
promoting
one
another
's
interests
,
business
,
and
advancement
*NL*
in
life
;
that
,
for
distinction
,
we
should
be
call
'd
The
Society
of
the
*NL*
Free
and
Easy
:
free
,
as
being
,
by
the
general
practice
and
habit
of
*NL*
the
virtues
,
free
from
the
dominion
of
vice
;
and
particularly
by
the
*NL*
practice
of
industry
and
frugality
,
free
from
debt
,
which
exposes
a
man
*NL*
to
confinement
,
and
a
species
of
slavery
to
his
creditors
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
as
much
as
I
can
now
recollect
of
the
project
,
except
that
I
*NL*
communicated
it
in
part
to
two
young
men
,
who
adopted
it
with
some
*NL*
enthusiasm
;
but
my
then
narrow
circumstances
,
and
the
necessity
I
was
*NL*
under
of
sticking
close
to
my
business
,
occasion
'd
my
postponing
the
*NL*
further
prosecution
of
it
at
that
time
;
and
my
multifarious
*NL*
occupations
,
public
and
private
,
induc
'd
me
to
continue
postponing
,
so
*NL*
that
it
has
been
omitted
till
I
have
no
longer
strength
or
activity
*NL*
left
sufficient
for
such
an
enterprise
;
tho
'
I
am
still
of
opinion
that
*NL*
it
was
a
practicable
scheme
,
and
might
have
been
very
useful
,
by
*NL*
forming
a
great
number
of
good
citizens
;

I
was
not
discourag

by
*NL*
the
seeming
magnitude
of

undertaking
,
as
I
have
always
thought
that
*NL*
one
man
of
tolerable
abilities
may
work
great
changes
,
and
accomplish
*NL*
great
affairs
among
mankind
,
if
he
first
forms
a
good
plan
,
and
,
*NL*
cutting
off
all
amusements
or
other
employments
that
would
divert
his
*NL*
attention
,
makes
the
execution
of
that
same
plan
his
sole
study
and
*NL*
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1732
I
first
publish
'd
my
Almanack
,
under
the
name
of
Richard
*NL*
Saunders
;
it
was
continu
'd
by
me
about
twenty-five
years
,
commonly
*NL*
call
'd
Poor
Richard
's
Almanac
.
I
endeavor
'd
to
make
it
both
*NL*
entertaining
and
useful
,
and
it
accordingly
came
to
be
in
such
demand
,
*NL*
that
I
reap
'd
considerable
profit
from
it
,
vending
annually
near
ten
*NL*
thousand
.
And
observing
that
it
was
generally
read
,
scarce
any
*NL*
neighborhood
in
the
province
being
without
it
,
I
consider
'd
it
as
a
*NL*
proper
vehicle
for
conveying
instruction
among
the
common
people
,
who
*NL*
bought
scarcely
any
other
books
;
I
therefore
filled
all
the
little
*NL*
spaces
that
occurr
'd
between
the
remarkable
days
in
the
calendar
with
*NL*
proverbial
sentences
,
chiefly
such
as
inculcated
industry
and
*NL*
frugality
,
as
the
means
of
procuring
wealth
,
and
thereby
securing
*NL*
virtue
;
it
being
more
difficult
for
a
man
in
want
,
to
act
always
*NL*
honestly
,
as
,
to
use
here
one
of
those
proverbs
,
it
is
hard
for
an
*NL*
empty
sack
to
stand
up-right
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
proverbs
,
which
contained
the
wisdom
of
many
ages
and
nations
,
I
*NL*
assembled
and
form
'd
into
a
connected
discourse
prefix
'd
to
the
*NL*
Almanack
of
1757
,
as
the
harangue
of
a
wise
old
man
to
the
people
*NL*
attending
an
auction
.
The
bringing
all
these
scatter
'd
counsels
thus
*NL*
into
a
focus
enabled
them
to
make
greater
impression
.
The
piece
,
being
*NL*
universally
approved
,
was
copied
in
all
the
newspapers
of
the
*NL*
Continent
;
reprinted
in
Britain
on
a
broad
side
,
to
be
stuck
up
in
*NL*
houses
;
two
translations
were
made
of
it
in
French
,
and
great
numbers
*NL*
bought
by
the
clergy
and
gentry
,
to
distribute
gratis
among
their
poor
*NL*
parishioners
and
tenants
.
In
Pennsylvania
,
as
it
discouraged
useless
*NL*
expense
in
foreign
superfluities
,
some
thought
it
had
its
share
of
*NL*
influence
in
producing
that
growing
plenty
of
money
which
was
*NL*
observable
for
several
years
after
its
publication
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
considered
my
newspaper
,
also
,
as
another
means
of
communicating
*NL*
instruction
,
and
in
that
view
frequently
reprinted
in
it
extracts
from
*NL*
the
Spectator
,
and
other
moral
writers
;
and
sometimes
publish
'd
little
*NL*
pieces
of
my
own
,
which
had
been
first
compos
'd
for
reading
in
our
*NL*
Junto
.
Of
these
are
a
Socratic
dialogue
,
tending
to
prove
that
,
*NL*
whatever
might
be
his
parts
and
abilities
,
a
vicious
man
could
not
*NL*
properly
be
called
a
man
of
sense
;
and
a
discourse
on
self-denial
,
*NL*
showing
that
virtue
was
not
secure
till
its
practice
became
a
habitude
,
*NL*
and
was
free
from
the
opposition
of
contrary
inclinations
.
These
may
*NL*
be
found
in
the
papers
about
the
beginning
of
1735
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
conduct
of
my
newspaper
,
I
carefully
excluded
all
libelling
and
*NL*
personal
abuse
,
which
is
of
late
years
become
so
disgraceful
to
our
*NL*
country
.
Whenever
I
was
solicited
to
insert
anything
of
that
kind
,
and
*NL*
the
writers
pleaded
,
as
they
generally
did
,
the
liberty
of
the
press
,
*NL*
and
that
a
newspaper
was
like
a
stagecoach
,
in
which
any
one
who
would
*NL*
pay
had
a
right
to
a
place
,
my
answer
was
,
that
I
would
print
the
piece
*NL*
separately
if
desired
,
and
the
author
might
have
as
many
copies
as
he
*NL*
pleased
to
distribute
himself
,
but
that
I
would
not
take
upon
me
to
*NL*
spread
his
detraction
;
and
that
,
having
contracted
with
my
subscribers
*NL*
to
furnish
them
with
what
might
be
either
useful
or
entertaining
,
I
*NL*
could
not
fill
their
papers
with
private
altercation
,
in
which
they
had
*NL*
no
concern
,
without
doing
them
manifest
injustice
.
Now
,
many
of
our
*NL*
printers
make
no
scruple
of
gratifying
the
malice
of
individuals
by
*NL*
false
accusations
of
the
fairest
characters
among
ourselves
,
augmenting
*NL*
animosity
even
to
the
producing
of
duels
;
and
are
,
moreover
,
so
*NL*
indiscreet
as
to
print
scurrilous
reflections
on
the
government
of
*NL*
neighboring
states
,
and
even
on
the
conduct
of
our
best
national
*NL*
allies
,
which
may
be
attended
with
the
most
pernicious
consequences
.
*NL*
These
things
I
mention
as
a
caution
to
young
printers
,
and
that
they
*NL*
may
be
encouraged
not
to
pollute
their
presses
and
disgrace
their
*NL*
profession
by
such
infamous
practices
,
but
refuse
steadily
,
as
they
may
*NL*
see
by
my
example
that
such
a
course
of
conduct
will
not
,
on
the
whole
,
*NL*
be
injurious
to
their
interests
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1733
I
sent
one
of
my
journeymen
to
Charleston
,
South
Carolina
,
*NL*
where
a
printer
was
wanting
.
I
furnish
'd
him
with
a
press
and
letters
,
*NL*
on
an
agreement
of
partnership
,
by
which
I
was
to
receive
one-third
of
*NL*
the
profits
of
the
business
,
paying
one-third
of
the
expense
.
He
was
a
*NL*
man
of
learning
,
and
honest
but
ignorant
in
matters
of
account
;
and
,
*NL*
tho
'
he
sometimes
made
me
remittances
,
I
could
get
no
account
from
him
,
*NL*
nor
any
satisfactory
state
of
our
partnership
while
he
lived
.
On
his
*NL*
decease
,
the
business
was
continued
by
his
widow
,
who
,
being
born
and
*NL*
bred
in
Holland
,
where
,
as
I
have
been
inform
'd
,
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
accounts
makes
a
part
of
female
education
,
she
not
only
sent
me
as
*NL*
clear
a
state
as
she
could
find
of
the
transactions
past
,
but
continued
*NL*
to
account
with
the
greatest
regularity
and
exactness
every
quarter
*NL*
afterwards
,
and
managed
the
business
with
such
success
,
that
she
not
*NL*
only
brought
up
reputably
a
family
of
children
,
but
,
at
the
expiration
*NL*
of
the
term
,
was
able
to
purchase
of
me
the
printing-house
,
and
*NL*
establish
her
son
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mention
this
affair
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
recommending
that
branch
*NL*
of
education
for
our
young
females
,
as
likely
to
be
of
more
use
to
them
*NL*
and
their
children
,
in
case
of
widowhood
,
than
either
music
or
dancing
,
*NL*
by
preserving
them
from
losses
by
imposition
of
crafty
men
,
and
*NL*
enabling
them
to
continue
,
perhaps
,
a
profitable
mercantile
house
,
with
*NL*
establish
'd
correspondence
,
till
a
son
is
grown
up
fit
to
undertake
and
*NL*
go
on
with
it
,
to
the
lasting
advantage
and
enriching
of
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
year
1734
there
arrived
among
us
from
Ireland
a
young
*NL*
Presbyterian
preacher
,
named
Hemphill
,
who
delivered
with
a
good
voice
,
*NL*
and
apparently
extempore
,
most
excellent
discourses
,
which
drew
*NL*
together
considerable
numbers
of
different
persuasion
,
who
join
'd
in
*NL*
admiring
them
.
Among
the
rest
,
I
became
one
of
his
constant
hearers
,
*NL*
his
sermons
pleasing
me
,
as
they
had
little
of
the
dogmatical
kind
,
but
*NL*
inculcated
strongly
the
practice
of
virtue
,
or
what
in
the
religious
*NL*
stile
are
called
good
works
.
Those
,
however
,
of
our
congregation
,
who
*NL*
considered
themselves
as
orthodox
Presbyterians
,
disapprov
'd
his
*NL*
doctrine
,
and
were
join
'd
by
most
of
the
old
clergy
,
who
arraign
'd
him
*NL*
of
heterodoxy
before
the
synod
,
in
order
to
have
him
silenc
'd
.
I
became
*NL*
his
zealous
partisan
,
and
contributed
all
I
could
to
raise
a
party
in
*NL*
his
favour
,
and
we
combated
for
him
a
while
with
some
hopes
of
success
.
*NL*
There
was
much
scribbling
pro
and
con
upon
the
occasion
;
and
finding
*NL*
that
,
tho
'
an
elegant
preacher
,
he
was
but
a
poor
writer
,
I
lent
him
my
*NL*
pen
and
wrote
for
him
two
or
three
pamphlets
,
and
one
piece
in
the
*NL*
Gazette
of
April
,
1735
.
Those
pamphlets
,
as
is
generally
the
case
with
*NL*
controversial
writings
,
tho
'
eagerly
read
at
the
time
,
were
soon
out
of
*NL*
vogue
,
and
I
question
whether
a
single
copy
of
them
now
exists
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
contest
an
unlucky
occurrence
hurt
his
cause
exceedingly
.
*NL*
One
of
our
adversaries
having
heard
him
preach
a
sermon
that
was
much
*NL*
admired
,
thought
he
had
somewhere
read
the
sermon
before
,
or
at
least
a
*NL*
part
of
it
.
On
search
he
found
that
part
quoted
at
length
,
in
one
of
*NL*
the
British
Reviews
,
from
a
discourse
of
Dr.
Foster
's
.
This
detection
*NL*
gave
many
of
our
party
disgust
,
who
accordingly
abandoned
his
cause
,
*NL*
and
occasion
'd
our
more
speedy
discomfiture
in
the
synod
.
I
stuck
by
*NL*
him
,
however
,
as
I
rather
approv
'd
his
giving
us
good
sermons
compos
'd
*NL*
by
others
,
than
bad
ones
of
his
own
manufacture
,
tho
'
the
latter
was
*NL*
the
practice
of
our
common
teachers
.
He
afterward
acknowledg
'd
to
me
*NL*
that
none
of
those
he
preach
'd
were
his
own
;
adding
,
that
his
memory
*NL*
was
such
as
enabled
him
to
retain
and
repeat
any
sermon
after
one
*NL*
reading
only
.
On
our
defeat
,
he
left
us
in
search
elsewhere
of
better
*NL*
fortune
,
and
I
quitted
the
congregation
,
never
joining
it
after
,
tho
'
I
*NL*
continu
'd
many
years
my
subscription
for
the
support
of
its
ministers
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
begun
in
1733
to
study
languages
;
I
soon
made
myself
so
much
a
*NL*
master
of
the
French
as
to
be
able
to
read
the
books
with
ease
.
I
then
*NL*
undertook
the
Italian
.
An
acquaintance
,
who
was
also
learning
it
,
us
'd
*NL*
often
to
tempt
me
to
play
chess
with
him
.
Finding
this
took
up
too
*NL*
much
of
the
time
I
had
to
spare
for
study
,
I
at
length
refus
'd
to
play
*NL*
any
more
,
unless
on
this
condition
,
that
the
victor
in
every
game
*NL*
should
have
a
right
to
impose
a
task
,
either
in
parts
of
the
grammar
to
*NL*
be
got
by
heart
,
or
in
translations
,
etc.
,
which
tasks
the
vanquish
'd
*NL*
was
to
perform
upon
honour
,
before
our
next
meeting
.
As
we
play
'd
*NL*
pretty
equally
,
we
thus
beat
one
another
into
that
language
.
I
*NL*
afterwards
with
a
little
painstaking
,
acquir
'd
as
much
of
the
Spanish
*NL*
as
to
read
their
books
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
already
mention
'd
that
I
had
only
one
year
's
instruction
in
a
*NL*
Latin
school
,
and
that
when
very
young
,
after
which
I
neglected
that
*NL*
language
entirely
.
But
,
when
I
had
attained
an
acquaintance
with
the
*NL*
French
,
Italian
,
and
Spanish
,
I
was
surpriz
'd
to
find
,
on
looking
over
*NL*
a
Latin
Testament
,
that
I
understood
so
much
more
of
that
language
than
*NL*
I
had
imagined
,
which
encouraged
me
to
apply
myself
again
to
the
study
*NL*
of
it
,
and
I
met
with
more
success
,
as
those
preceding
languages
had
*NL*
greatly
smooth
'd
my
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
these
circumstances
,
I
have
thought
that
there
is
some
*NL*
inconsistency
in
our
common
mode
of
teaching
languages
.
We
are
told
*NL*
that
it
is
proper
to
begin
first
with
the
Latin
,
and
,
having
acquir
'd
*NL*
that
,
it
will
be
more
easy
to
attain
those
modern
languages
which
are
*NL*
deriv
'd
from
it
;
and
yet
we
do
not
begin
with
the
Greek
,
in
order
more
*NL*
easily
to
acquire
the
Latin
.
It
is
true
that
,
if
you
can
clamber
and
*NL*
get
to
the
top
of
a
staircase
without
using
the
steps
,
you
will
more
*NL*
easily
gain
them
in
descending
;
but
certainly
,
if
you
begin
with
the
*NL*
lowest
you
will
with
more
ease
ascend
to
the
top
;
and
I
would
therefore
*NL*
offer
it
to
the
consideration
of
those
who
superintend
the
education
of
*NL*
our
youth
,
whether
,
since
many
of
those
who
begin
with
the
Latin
quit
*NL*
the
same
after
spending
some
years
without
having
made
any
great
*NL*
proficiency
,
and
what
they
have
learnt
becomes
almost
useless
,
so
that
*NL*
their
time
has
been
lost
,
it
would
not
have
been
better
to
have
begun
*NL*
with
the
French
,
proceeding
to
the
Italian
,
etc.
;
for
,
tho
'
,
after
*NL*
spending
the
same
time
,
they
should
quit
the
study
of
languages
and
*NL*
never
arrive
at
the
Latin
,
they
would
,
however
,
have
acquired
another
*NL*
tongue
or
two
,
that
,
being
in
modern
use
,
might
be
serviceable
to
them
*NL*
in
common
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
ten
years
'
absence
from
Boston
,
and
having
become
easy
in
my
*NL*
circumstances
,
I
made
a
journey
thither
to
visit
my
relations
,
which
I
*NL*
could
not
sooner
well
afford
.
In
returning
,
I
call
'd
at
Newport
to
see
*NL*
my
brother
,
then
settled
there
with
his
printing-house
.
Our
former
*NL*
differences
were
forgotten
,
and
our
meeting
was
very
cordial
and
*NL*
affectionate
.
He
was
fast
declining
in
his
health
,
and
requested
of
me
*NL*
that
,
in
case
of
his
death
,
which
he
apprehended
not
far
distant
,
I
*NL*
would
take
home
his
son
,
then
but
ten
years
of
age
,
and
bring
him
up
to
*NL*
the
printing
business
.
This
I
accordingly
perform
'd
,
sending
him
a
few
*NL*
years
to
school
before
I
took
him
into
the
office
.
His
mother
carried
*NL*
on
the
business
till
he
was
grown
up
,
when
I
assisted
him
with
an
*NL*
assortment
of
new
types
,
those
of
his
father
being
in
a
manner
worn
*NL*
out
.
Thus
it
was
that
I
made
my
brother
ample
amends
for
the
service
I
*NL*
had
depriv
'd
him
of
by
leaving
him
so
early
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1736
I
lost
one
of
my
sons
,
a
fine
boy
of
four
years
old
,
by
the
*NL*
small-pox
,
taken
in
the
common
way
.
I
long
regretted
bitterly
,
and
*NL*
still
regret
that
I
had
not
given
it
to
him
by
inoculation
.
This
I
*NL*
mention
for
the
sake
of
parents
who
omit
that
operation
,
on
the
*NL*
supposition
that
they
should
never
forgive
themselves
if
a
child
died
*NL*
under
it
;
my
example
showing
that
the
regret
may
be
the
same
either
*NL*
way
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
the
safer
should
be
chosen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
club
,
the
Junto
,
was
found
so
useful
,
and
afforded
such
*NL*
satisfaction
to
the
members
,
that
several
were
desirous
of
introducing
*NL*
their
friends
,
which
could
not
well
be
done
without
exceeding
what
we
*NL*
had
settled
as
a
convenient
number
,
viz.
,
twelve
.
We
had
from
the
*NL*
beginning
made
it
a
rule
to
keep
our
institution
a
secret
,
which
was
*NL*
pretty
well
observ
'd
;
the
intention
was
to
avoid
applications
of
*NL*
improper
persons
for
admittance
,
some
of
whom
,
perhaps
,
we
might
find
*NL*
it
difficult
to
refuse
.
I
was
one
of
those
who
were
against
any
*NL*
addition
to
our
number
,
but
,
instead
of
it
,
made
in
writing
a
proposal
,
*NL*
that
every
member
separately
should
endeavor
to
form
a
subordinate
*NL*
club
,
with
the
same
rules
respecting
queries
,
etc.
,
and
without
*NL*
informing
them
of
the
connection
with
the
Junto
.
The
advantages
*NL*
proposed
were
,
the
improvement
of
so
many
more
young
citizens
by
the
*NL*
use
of
our
institutions
;
our
better
acquaintance
with
the
general
*NL*
sentiments
of
the
inhabitants
on
any
occasion
,
as
the
Junto
member
*NL*
might
propose
what
queries
we
should
desire
,
and
was
to
report
to
the
*NL*
Junto
what
pass
'd
in
his
separate
club
;
the
promotion
of
our
particular
*NL*
interests
in
business
by
more
extensive
recommendation
,
and
the
*NL*
increase
of
our
influence
in
public
affairs
,
and
our
power
of
doing
*NL*
good
by
spreading
thro
'
the
several
clubs
the
sentiments
of
the
Junto
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
project
was
approv
'd
,
and
every
member
undertook
to
form
his
club
,
*NL*
but
they
did
not
all
succeed
.
Five
or
six
only
were
compleated
,
which
*NL*
were
called
by
different
names
,
as
the
Vine
,
the
Union
,
the
Band
,
etc.
.
*NL*
They
were
useful
to
themselves
,
and
afforded
us
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
amusement
,
information
,
and
instruction
,
besides
answering
,
in
some
*NL*
considerable
degree
,
our
views
of
influencing
the
public
opinion
on
*NL*
particular
occasions
,
of
which
I
shall
give
some
instances
in
course
of
*NL*
time
as
they
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
promotion
was
my
being
chosen
,
in
1736
,
clerk
of
the
General
*NL*
Assembly
.
The
choice
was
made
that
year
without
opposition
;
but
the
*NL*
year
following
,
when
I
was
again
propos
'd
-LRB-
the
choice
,
like
that
of
the
*NL*
members
,
being
annual
-RRB-
,
a
new
member
made
a
long
speech
against
me
,
in
*NL*
order
to
favour
some
other
candidate
.
I
was
,
however
,
chosen
,
which
*NL*
was
the
more
agreeable
to
me
,
as
,
besides
the
pay
for
the
immediate
*NL*
service
as
clerk
,
the
place
gave
me
a
better
opportunity
of
keeping
up
*NL*
an
interest
among
the
members
,
which
secur
'd
to
me
the
business
of
*NL*
printing
the
votes
,
laws
,
paper
money
,
and
other
occasional
jobbs
for
*NL*
the
public
,
that
,
on
the
whole
,
were
very
profitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
therefore
did
not
like
the
opposition
of
this
new
member
,
who
was
a
*NL*
gentleman
of
fortune
and
education
,
with
talents
that
were
likely
to
*NL*
give
him
,
in
time
,
great
influence
in
the
House
,
which
,
indeed
,
*NL*
afterwards
happened
.
I
did
not
,
however
,
aim
at
gaining
his
favour
by
*NL*
paying
any
servile
respect
to
him
,
but
,
after
some
time
,
took
this
*NL*
other
method
.
Having
heard
that
he
had
in
his
library
a
certain
very
*NL*
scarce
and
curious
book
,
I
wrote
a
note
to
him
,
expressing
my
desire
of
*NL*
perusing
that
book
,
and
requesting
he
would
do
me
the
favour
of
lending
*NL*
it
to
me
for
a
few
days
.
He
sent
it
immediately
,
and
I
return
'd
it
in
*NL*
about
a
week
with
another
note
,
expressing
strongly
my
sense
of
the
*NL*
favour
.
When
we
next
met
in
the
House
,
he
spoke
to
me
-LRB-
which
he
had
*NL*
never
done
before
-RRB-
,
and
with
great
civility
;
and
he
ever
after
*NL*
manifested
a
readiness
to
serve
me
on
all
occasions
,
so
that
we
became
*NL*
great
friends
,
and
our
friendship
continued
to
his
death
.
This
is
*NL*
another
instance
of
the
truth
of
an
old
maxim
I
had
learned
,
which
*NL*
says
,
``
He
that
has
once
done
you
a
kindness
will
be
more
ready
to
do
*NL*
you
another
,
than
he
whom
you
yourself
have
obliged
.
''
And
it
shows
how
*NL*
much
more
profitable
it
is
prudently
to
remove
,
than
to
resent
,
return
,
*NL*
and
continue
inimical
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1737
,
Colonel
Spotswood
,
late
governor
of
Virginia
,
and
then
*NL*
postmaster-general
,
being
dissatisfied
with
the
conduct
of
his
deputy
*NL*
at
Philadelphia
,
respecting
some
negligence
in
rendering
,
and
*NL*
inexactitude
of
his
accounts
,
took
from
him
the
commission
and
offered
*NL*
it
to
me
.
I
accepted
it
readily
,
and
found
it
of
great
advantage
;
for
,
*NL*
tho
'
the
salary
was
small
,
it
facilitated
the
correspondence
that
*NL*
improv
'd
my
newspaper
,
increas
'd
the
number
demanded
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
advertisements
to
be
inserted
,
so
that
it
came
to
afford
me
a
*NL*
considerable
income
.
My
old
competitor
's
newspaper
declin
'd
*NL*
proportionably
,
and
I
was
satisfy
'd
without
retaliating
his
refusal
,
*NL*
while
postmaster
,
to
permit
my
papers
being
carried
by
the
riders
.
*NL*
Thus
he
suffer
'd
greatly
from
his
neglect
in
due
accounting
;
and
I
*NL*
mention
it
as
a
lesson
to
those
young
men
who
may
be
employ
'd
in
*NL*
managing
affairs
for
others
,
that
they
should
always
render
accounts
,
*NL*
and
make
remittances
,
with
great
clearness
and
punctuality
.
The
*NL*
character
of
observing
such
a
conduct
is
the
most
powerful
of
all
*NL*
recommendations
to
new
employments
and
increase
of
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
now
to
turn
my
thoughts
a
little
to
public
affairs
,
beginning
,
*NL*
however
,
with
small
matters
.
The
city
watch
was
one
of
the
first
*NL*
things
that
I
conceiv
'd
to
want
regulation
.
It
was
managed
by
the
*NL*
constables
of
the
respective
wards
in
turn
;
the
constable
warned
a
*NL*
number
of
housekeepers
to
attend
him
for
the
night
.
Those
who
chose
*NL*
never
to
attend
paid
him
six
shillings
a
year
to
be
excus
'd
,
which
was
*NL*
suppos
'd
to
be
for
hiring
substitutes
,
but
was
,
in
reality
,
much
more
*NL*
than
was
necessary
for
that
purpose
,
and
made
the
constableship
a
place
*NL*
of
profit
;
and
the
constable
,
for
a
little
drink
,
often
got
such
*NL*
ragamuffins
about
him
as
a
watch
,
that
respectable
housekeepers
did
not
*NL*
choose
to
mix
with
.
Walking
the
rounds
,
too
,
was
often
neglected
,
and
*NL*
most
of
the
nights
spent
in
tippling
.
I
thereupon
wrote
a
paper
,
to
be
*NL*
read
in
Junto
,
representing
these
irregularities
,
but
insisting
more
*NL*
particularly
on
the
inequality
of
this
six-shilling
tax
of
the
*NL*
constables
,
respecting
the
circumstances
of
those
who
paid
it
,
since
a
*NL*
poor
widow
housekeeper
,
all
whose
property
to
be
guarded
by
the
watch
*NL*
did
not
perhaps
exceed
the
value
of
fifty
pounds
,
paid
as
much
as
the
*NL*
wealthiest
merchant
,
who
had
thousands
of
pounds
worth
of
goods
in
his
*NL*
stores
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
,
I
proposed
as
a
more
effectual
watch
,
the
hiring
of
*NL*
proper
men
to
serve
constantly
in
that
business
;
and
as
a
more
*NL*
equitable
way
of
supporting
the
charge
the
levying
a
tax
that
should
be
*NL*
proportion
'd
to
the
property
.
This
idea
,
being
approv
'd
by
the
Junto
,
*NL*
was
communicated
to
the
other
clubs
,
but
as
arising
in
each
of
them
;
*NL*
and
though
the
plan
was
not
immediately
carried
into
execution
,
yet
,
by
*NL*
preparing
the
minds
of
people
for
the
change
,
it
paved
the
way
for
the
*NL*
law
obtained
a
few
years
after
,
when
the
members
of
our
clubs
were
*NL*
grown
into
more
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
I
wrote
a
paper
-LRB-
first
to
be
read
in
Junto
,
but
it
was
*NL*
afterward
publish
'd
-RRB-
on
the
different
accidents
and
carelessnesses
by
*NL*
which
houses
were
set
on
fire
,
with
cautions
against
them
,
and
means
*NL*
proposed
of
avoiding
them
.
This
was
much
spoken
of
as
a
useful
piece
,
*NL*
and
gave
rise
to
a
project
,
which
soon
followed
it
,
of
forming
a
*NL*
company
for
the
more
ready
extinguishing
of
fires
,
and
mutual
*NL*
assistance
in
removing
and
securing
the
goods
when
in
danger
.
*NL*
Associates
in
this
scheme
were
presently
found
,
amounting
to
thirty
.
*NL*
Our
articles
of
agreement
oblig
'd
every
member
to
keep
always
in
good
*NL*
order
,
and
fit
for
use
,
a
certain
number
of
leather
buckets
,
with
*NL*
strong
bags
and
baskets
-LRB-
for
packing
and
transporting
of
goods
-RRB-
,
which
*NL*
were
to
be
brought
to
every
fire
;
and
we
agreed
to
meet
once
a
month
*NL*
and
spend
a
social
evening
together
,
in
discoursing
and
communicating
*NL*
such
ideas
as
occurred
to
us
upon
the
subject
of
fires
,
as
might
be
*NL*
useful
in
our
conduct
on
such
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
utility
of
this
institution
soon
appeared
,
and
many
more
desiring
*NL*
to
be
admitted
than
we
thought
convenient
for
one
company
,
they
were
*NL*
advised
to
form
another
,
which
was
accordingly
done
;
and
this
went
on
,
*NL*
one
new
company
being
formed
after
another
,
till
they
became
so
*NL*
numerous
as
to
include
most
of
the
inhabitants
who
were
men
of
*NL*
property
;
and
now
,
at
the
time
of
my
writing
this
,
tho
'
upward
of
fifty
*NL*
years
since
its
establishment
,
that
which
I
first
formed
,
called
the
*NL*
Union
Fire
Company
,
still
subsists
and
flourishes
,
tho
'
the
first
*NL*
members
are
all
deceas
'd
but
myself
and
one
,
who
is
older
by
a
year
*NL*
than
I
am
.
The
small
fines
that
have
been
paid
by
members
for
absence
*NL*
at
the
monthly
meetings
have
been
apply
'd
to
the
purchase
of
*NL*
fire-engines
,
ladders
,
fire-hooks
,
and
other
useful
implements
for
each
*NL*
company
,
so
that
I
question
whether
there
is
a
city
in
the
world
better
*NL*
provided
with
the
means
of
putting
a
stop
to
beginning
conflagrations
;
*NL*
and
,
in
fact
,
since
these
institutions
,
the
city
has
never
lost
by
fire
*NL*
more
than
one
or
two
houses
at
a
time
,
and
the
flames
have
often
been
*NL*
extinguished
before
the
house
in
which
they
began
has
been
half
*NL*
consumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1739
arrived
among
us
from
Ireland
the
Reverend
Mr.
Whitefield
,
who
*NL*
had
made
himself
remarkable
there
as
an
itinerant
preacher
.
He
was
at
*NL*
first
permitted
to
preach
in
some
of
our
churches
;
but
the
clergy
,
*NL*
taking
a
dislike
to
him
,
soon
refus
'd
him
their
pulpits
,
and
he
was
*NL*
oblig
'd
to
preach
in
the
fields
.
The
multitudes
of
all
sects
and
*NL*
denominations
that
attended
his
sermons
were
enormous
,
and
it
was
*NL*
matter
of
speculation
to
me
,
who
was
one
of
the
number
,
to
observe
the
*NL*
extraordinary
influence
of
his
oratory
on
his
hearers
,
and
how
much
*NL*
they
admir
'd
and
respected
him
,
notwithstanding
his
common
abuse
of
*NL*
them
,
by
assuring
them
that
they
were
naturally
half
beasts
and
half
*NL*
devils
.
It
was
wonderful
to
see
the
change
soon
made
in
the
manners
of
*NL*
our
inhabitants
.
From
being
thoughtless
or
indifferent
about
religion
,
*NL*
it
seem
'd
as
if
all
the
world
were
growing
religious
,
so
that
one
could
*NL*
not
walk
thro
'
the
town
in
an
evening
without
hearing
psalms
sung
in
*NL*
different
families
of
every
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
being
found
inconvenient
to
assemble
in
the
open
air
,
subject
to
*NL*
its
inclemencies
,
the
building
of
a
house
to
meet
in
was
no
sooner
*NL*
propos
'd
,
and
persons
appointed
to
receive
contributions
,
but
*NL*
sufficient
sums
were
soon
receiv
'd
to
procure
the
ground
and
erect
the
*NL*
building
,
which
was
one
hundred
feet
long
and
seventy
broad
,
about
the
*NL*
size
of
Westminster
Hall
;
and
the
work
was
carried
on
with
such
spirit
*NL*
as
to
be
finished
in
a
much
shorter
time
than
could
have
been
expected
.
*NL*
Both
house
and
ground
were
vested
in
trustees
,
expressly
for
the
use
of
*NL*
any
preacher
of
any
religious
persuasion
who
might
desire
to
say
*NL*
something
to
the
people
at
Philadelphia
;
the
design
in
building
not
*NL*
being
to
accommodate
any
particular
sect
,
but
the
inhabitants
in
*NL*
general
;
so
that
even
if
the
Mufti
of
Constantinople
were
to
send
a
*NL*
missionary
to
preach
Mohammedanism
to
us
,
he
would
find
a
pulpit
at
his
*NL*
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Whitefield
,
in
leaving
us
,
went
preaching
all
the
way
thro
'
the
*NL*
colonies
to
Georgia
.
The
settlement
of
that
province
had
lately
been
*NL*
begun
,
but
,
instead
of
being
made
with
hardy
,
industrious
husbandmen
,
*NL*
accustomed
to
labor
,
the
only
people
fit
for
such
an
enterprise
,
it
was
*NL*
with
families
of
broken
shop-keepers
and
other
insolvent
debtors
,
many
*NL*
of
indolent
and
idle
habits
,
taken
out
of
the
jails
,
who
,
being
set
*NL*
down
in
the
woods
,
unqualified
for
clearing
land
,
and
unable
to
endure
*NL*
the
hardships
of
a
new
settlement
,
perished
in
numbers
,
leaving
many
*NL*
helpless
children
unprovided
for
.
The
sight
of
their
miserable
*NL*
situation
inspir
'd
the
benevolent
heart
of
Mr.
Whitefield
with
the
idea
*NL*
of
building
an
Orphan
House
there
,
in
which
they
might
be
supported
and
*NL*
educated
.
Returning
northward
,
he
preach
'd
up
this
charity
,
and
made
*NL*
large
collections
,
for
his
eloquence
had
a
wonderful
power
over
the
*NL*
hearts
and
purses
of
his
hearers
,
of
which
I
myself
was
an
instance
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
disapprove
of
the
design
,
but
,
as
Georgia
was
then
destitute
*NL*
of
materials
and
workmen
,
and
it
was
proposed
to
send
them
from
*NL*
Philadelphia
at
a
great
expense
,
I
thought
it
would
have
been
better
to
*NL*
have
built
the
house
here
,
and
brought
the
children
to
it
.
This
I
*NL*
advis
'd
;
but
he
was
resolute
in
his
first
project
,
rejected
my
counsel
,
*NL*
and
I
therefore
refus
'd
to
contribute
.
I
happened
soon
after
to
attend
*NL*
one
of
his
sermons
,
in
the
course
of
which
I
perceived
he
intended
to
*NL*
finish
with
a
collection
,
and
I
silently
resolved
he
should
get
nothing
*NL*
from
me
,
I
had
in
my
pocket
a
handful
of
copper
money
,
three
or
four
*NL*
silver
dollars
,
and
five
pistoles
in
gold
.
As
he
proceeded
I
began
to
*NL*
soften
,
and
concluded
to
give
the
coppers
.
Another
stroke
of
his
*NL*
oratory
made
me
asham
'd
of
that
,
and
determin
'd
me
to
give
the
silver
;
*NL*
and
he
finish
'd
so
admirably
,
that
I
empty
'd
my
pocket
wholly
into
the
*NL*
collector
's
dish
,
gold
and
all
.
At
this
sermon
there
was
also
one
of
*NL*
our
club
,
who
,
being
of
my
sentiments
respecting
the
building
in
*NL*
Georgia
,
and
suspecting
a
collection
might
be
intended
,
had
,
by
*NL*
precaution
,
emptied
his
pockets
before
he
came
from
home
.
Towards
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
the
discourse
,
however
,
he
felt
a
strong
desire
to
give
,
*NL*
and
apply
'd
to
a
neighbour
,
who
stood
near
him
,
to
borrow
some
money
*NL*
for
the
purpose
.
The
application
was
unfortunately
-LSB-
made
-RSB-
to
perhaps
*NL*
the
only
man
in
the
company
who
had
the
firmness
not
to
be
affected
by
*NL*
the
preacher
.
His
answer
was
,
``
At
any
other
time
,
Friend
Hopkinson
,
I
*NL*
would
lend
to
thee
freely
;
but
not
now
,
for
thee
seems
to
be
out
of
thy
*NL*
right
senses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
Mr.
Whitefield
's
enemies
affected
to
suppose
that
he
would
*NL*
apply
these
collections
to
his
own
private
emolument
;
but
I
who
was
*NL*
intimately
acquainted
with
him
-LRB-
being
employed
in
printing
his
Sermons
*NL*
and
Journals
,
etc.
-RRB-
,
never
had
the
least
suspicion
of
his
integrity
,
*NL*
but
am
to
this
day
decidedly
of
opinion
that
he
was
in
all
his
conduct
*NL*
a
perfectly
honest
man
,
and
methinks
my
testimony
in
his
favour
ought
*NL*
to
have
the
more
weight
,
as
we
had
no
religious
connection
.
He
us
'd
,
*NL*
indeed
,
sometimes
to
pray
for
my
conversion
,
but
never
had
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
believing
that
his
prayers
were
heard
.
Ours
was
a
mere
*NL*
civil
friendship
,
sincere
on
both
sides
,
and
lasted
to
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
instance
will
show
something
of
the
terms
on
which
we
*NL*
stood
.
Upon
one
of
his
arrivals
from
England
at
Boston
,
he
wrote
to
me
*NL*
that
he
should
come
soon
to
Philadelphia
,
but
knew
not
where
he
could
*NL*
lodge
when
there
,
as
he
understood
his
old
friend
and
host
,
Mr.
*NL*
Benezet
,
was
removed
to
Germantown
.
My
answer
was
,
``
You
know
my
house
;
*NL*
if
you
can
make
shift
with
its
scanty
accommodations
,
you
will
be
most
*NL*
heartily
welcome
.
''
He
reply
'd
,
that
if
I
made
that
kind
offer
for
*NL*
Christ
's
sake
,
I
should
not
miss
of
a
reward
.
And
I
returned
,
``
Do
n't
*NL*
let
me
be
mistaken
;
it
was
not
for
Christ
's
sake
,
but
for
your
sake
.
''
*NL*
One
of
our
common
acquaintance
jocosely
remark
'd
,
that
,
knowing
it
to
*NL*
be
the
custom
of
the
saints
,
when
they
received
any
favour
,
to
shift
*NL*
the
burden
of
the
obligation
from
off
their
own
shoulders
,
and
place
it
*NL*
in
heaven
,
I
had
contriv
'd
to
fix
it
on
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
time
I
saw
Mr.
Whitefield
was
in
London
,
when
he
consulted
me
*NL*
about
his
Orphan
House
concern
,
and
his
purpose
of
appropriating
it
to
*NL*
the
establishment
of
a
college
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
loud
and
clear
voice
,
and
articulated
his
words
and
sentences
*NL*
so
perfectly
,
that
he
might
be
heard
and
understood
at
a
great
*NL*
distance
,
especially
as
his
auditories
,
however
numerous
,
observ
'd
the
*NL*
most
exact
silence
.
He
preach
'd
one
evening
from
the
top
of
the
*NL*
Court-house
steps
,
which
are
in
the
middle
of
Market-street
,
and
on
the
*NL*
west
side
of
Second-street
,
which
crosses
it
at
right
angles
.
Both
*NL*
streets
were
fill
'd
with
his
hearers
to
a
considerable
distance
.
Being
*NL*
among
the
hindmost
in
Market-street
,
I
had
the
curiosity
to
learn
how
*NL*
far
he
could
be
heard
,
by
retiring
backwards
down
the
street
towards
*NL*
the
river
;
and
I
found
his
voice
distinct
till
I
came
near
*NL*
Front-street
,
when
some
noise
in
that
street
obscur
'd
it
.
Imagining
*NL*
then
a
semi-circle
,
of
which
my
distance
should
be
the
radius
,
and
that
*NL*
it
were
fill
'd
with
auditors
,
to
each
of
whom
I
allow
'd
two
square
*NL*
feet
,
I
computed
that
he
might
well
be
heard
by
more
than
thirty
*NL*
thousand
.
This
reconcil
'd
me
to
the
newspaper
accounts
of
his
having
*NL*
preach
'd
to
twenty-five
thousand
people
in
the
fields
,
and
to
the
*NL*
antient
histories
of
generals
haranguing
whole
armies
,
of
which
I
had
*NL*
sometimes
doubted
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
hearing
him
often
,
I
came
to
distinguish
easily
between
sermons
*NL*
newly
compos
'd
,
and
those
which
he
had
often
preach
'd
in
the
course
of
*NL*
his
travels
.
His
delivery
of
the
latter
was
so
improv
'd
by
frequent
*NL*
repetitions
that
every
accent
,
every
emphasis
,
every
modulation
of
*NL*
voice
,
was
so
perfectly
well
turn
'd
and
well
plac
'd
,
that
,
without
*NL*
being
interested
in
the
subject
,
one
could
not
help
being
pleas
'd
with
*NL*
the
discourse
;
a
pleasure
of
much
the
same
kind
with
that
receiv
'd
from
*NL*
an
excellent
piece
of
musick
.
This
is
an
advantage
itinerant
preachers
*NL*
have
over
those
who
are
stationary
,
as
the
latter
can
not
well
improve
*NL*
their
delivery
of
a
sermon
by
so
many
rehearsals
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
writing
and
printing
from
time
to
time
gave
great
advantage
to
his
*NL*
enemies
;
unguarded
expressions
,
and
even
erroneous
opinions
,
delivered
*NL*
in
preaching
,
might
have
been
afterwards
explain
'd
or
qualifi
'd
by
*NL*
supposing
others
that
might
have
accompani
'd
them
,
or
they
might
have
*NL*
been
deny
'd
;
but
litera
scripta
monet
.
Critics
attack
'd
his
writings
*NL*
violently
,
and
with
so
much
appearance
of
reason
as
to
diminish
the
*NL*
number
of
his
votaries
and
prevent
their
encrease
;
so
that
I
am
of
*NL*
opinion
if
he
had
never
written
any
thing
,
he
would
have
left
behind
*NL*
him
a
much
more
numerous
and
important
sect
,
and
his
reputation
might
*NL*
in
that
case
have
been
still
growing
,
even
after
his
death
,
as
there
*NL*
being
nothing
of
his
writing
on
which
to
found
a
censure
and
give
him
a
*NL*
lower
character
,
his
proselytes
would
be
left
at
liberty
to
feign
for
*NL*
him
as
great
a
variety
of
excellence
as
their
enthusiastic
admiration
*NL*
might
wish
him
to
have
possessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
business
was
now
continually
augmenting
,
and
my
circumstances
*NL*
growing
daily
easier
,
my
newspaper
having
become
very
profitable
,
as
*NL*
being
for
a
time
almost
the
only
one
in
this
and
the
neighbouring
*NL*
provinces
.
I
experienced
,
too
,
the
truth
of
the
observation
,
``
that
*NL*
after
getting
the
first
hundred
pound
,
it
is
more
easy
to
get
the
*NL*
second
,
''
money
itself
being
of
a
prolific
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
partnership
at
Carolina
having
succeeded
,
I
was
encourag
'd
to
*NL*
engage
in
others
,
and
to
promote
several
of
my
workmen
,
who
had
behaved
*NL*
well
,
by
establishing
them
with
printing-houses
in
different
colonies
,
*NL*
on
the
same
terms
with
that
in
Carolina
.
Most
of
them
did
well
,
being
*NL*
enabled
at
the
end
of
our
term
,
six
years
,
to
purchase
the
types
of
me
*NL*
and
go
on
working
for
themselves
,
by
which
means
several
families
were
*NL*
raised
.
Partnerships
often
finish
in
quarrels
;
but
I
was
happy
in
*NL*
this
,
that
mine
were
all
carried
on
and
ended
amicably
,
owing
,
I
think
,
*NL*
a
good
deal
to
the
precaution
of
having
very
explicitly
settled
,
in
our
*NL*
articles
,
every
thing
to
be
done
by
or
expected
from
each
partner
,
so
*NL*
that
there
was
nothing
to
dispute
,
which
precaution
I
would
therefore
*NL*
recommend
to
all
who
enter
into
partnerships
;
for
,
whatever
esteem
*NL*
partners
may
have
for
,
and
confidence
in
each
other
at
the
time
of
the
*NL*
contract
,
little
jealousies
and
disgusts
may
arise
,
with
ideas
of
*NL*
inequality
in
the
care
and
burden
of
the
business
,
etc.
,
which
are
*NL*
attended
often
with
breach
of
friendship
and
of
the
connection
,
perhaps
*NL*
with
lawsuits
and
other
disagreeable
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
,
on
the
whole
,
abundant
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
my
being
*NL*
established
in
Pennsylvania
.
There
were
,
however
,
two
things
that
I
*NL*
regretted
,
there
being
no
provision
for
defense
,
nor
for
a
compleat
*NL*
education
of
youth
;
no
militia
,
nor
any
college
.
I
therefore
,
in
1743
,
*NL*
drew
up
a
proposal
for
establishing
an
academy
;
and
at
that
time
,
*NL*
thinking
the
Reverend
Mr.
Peters
,
who
was
out
of
employ
,
a
fit
person
*NL*
to
superintend
such
an
institution
,
I
communicated
the
project
to
him
;
*NL*
but
he
,
having
more
profitable
views
in
the
service
of
the
*NL*
proprietaries
,
which
succeeded
,
declin
'd
the
undertaking
;
and
,
not
*NL*
knowing
another
at
that
time
suitable
for
such
a
trust
,
I
let
the
*NL*
scheme
lie
a
while
dormant
.
I
succeeded
better
the
next
year
,
1744
,
in
*NL*
proposing
and
establishing
a
Philosophical
Society
.
The
paper
I
wrote
*NL*
for
that
purpose
will
be
found
among
my
writings
,
when
collected
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
respect
to
defense
,
Spain
having
been
several
years
at
war
against
*NL*
Great
Britain
,
and
being
at
length
join
'd
by
France
,
which
brought
us
*NL*
into
great
danger
;
and
the
laboured
and
long-continued
endeavour
of
our
*NL*
governor
,
Thomas
,
to
prevail
with
our
Quaker
Assembly
to
pass
a
militia
*NL*
law
,
and
make
other
provisions
for
the
security
of
the
province
,
having
*NL*
proved
abortive
,
I
determined
to
try
what
might
be
done
by
a
voluntary
*NL*
association
of
the
people
.
To
promote
this
,
I
first
wrote
and
*NL*
published
a
pamphlet
,
entitled
PLAIN
TRUTH
,
in
which
I
stated
our
*NL*
defenceless
situation
in
strong
lights
,
with
the
necessity
of
union
and
*NL*
discipline
for
our
defense
,
and
promis
'd
to
propose
in
a
few
days
an
*NL*
association
,
to
be
generally
signed
for
that
purpose
.
The
pamphlet
had
*NL*
a
sudden
and
surprising
effect
.
I
was
call
'd
upon
for
the
instrument
*NL*
of
association
,
and
having
settled
the
draft
of
it
with
a
few
friends
,
*NL*
I
appointed
a
meeting
of
the
citizens
in
the
large
building
before
*NL*
mentioned
.
The
house
was
pretty
full
;
I
had
prepared
a
number
of
*NL*
printed
copies
,
and
provided
pens
and
ink
dispers
'd
all
over
the
room
.
*NL*
I
harangued
them
a
little
on
the
subject
,
read
the
paper
,
and
explained
*NL*
it
,
and
then
distributed
the
copies
,
which
were
eagerly
signed
,
not
the
*NL*
least
objection
being
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
company
separated
,
and
the
papers
were
collected
,
we
found
*NL*
above
twelve
hundred
hands
;
and
,
other
copies
being
dispersed
in
the
*NL*
country
,
the
subscribers
amounted
at
length
to
upward
of
ten
thousand
.
*NL*
These
all
furnished
themselves
as
soon
as
they
could
with
arms
,
formed
*NL*
themselves
into
companies
and
regiments
,
chose
their
own
officers
,
and
*NL*
met
every
week
to
be
instructed
in
the
manual
exercise
,
and
other
parts
*NL*
of
military
discipline
.
The
women
,
by
subscriptions
among
themselves
,
*NL*
provided
silk
colors
,
which
they
presented
to
the
companies
,
painted
*NL*
with
different
devices
and
mottos
,
which
I
supplied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
of
the
companies
composing
the
Philadelphia
regiment
,
*NL*
being
met
,
chose
me
for
their
colonel
;
but
,
conceiving
myself
unfit
,
I
*NL*
declin
'd
that
station
,
and
recommended
Mr.
Lawrence
,
a
fine
person
,
and
*NL*
man
of
influence
,
who
was
accordingly
appointed
.
I
then
propos
'd
a
*NL*
lottery
to
defray
the
expense
of
building
a
battery
below
the
town
,
and
*NL*
furnishing
it
with
cannon
.
It
filled
expeditiously
,
and
the
battery
*NL*
was
soon
erected
,
the
merlons
being
fram
'd
of
logs
and
fill
'd
with
*NL*
earth
.
We
bought
some
old
cannon
from
Boston
,
but
,
these
not
being
*NL*
sufficient
,
we
wrote
to
England
for
more
,
soliciting
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
our
proprietaries
for
some
assistance
,
tho
'
without
much
expectation
of
*NL*
obtaining
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Colonel
Lawrence
,
William
Allen
,
Abram
Taylor
,
Esqr.
,
and
*NL*
myself
were
sent
to
New
York
by
the
associators
,
commission
'd
to
borrow
*NL*
some
cannon
of
Governor
Clinton
.
He
at
first
refus
'd
us
peremptorily
;
*NL*
but
at
dinner
with
his
council
,
where
there
was
great
drinking
of
*NL*
Madeira
wine
,
as
the
custom
of
that
place
then
was
,
he
softened
by
*NL*
degrees
,
and
said
he
would
lend
us
six
.
After
a
few
more
bumpers
he
*NL*
advanc
'd
to
ten
;
and
at
length
he
very
good-naturedly
conceded
*NL*
eighteen
.
They
were
fine
cannon
,
eighteen-pounders
,
with
their
*NL*
carriages
,
which
we
soon
transported
and
mounted
on
our
battery
,
where
*NL*
the
associators
kept
a
nightly
guard
while
the
war
lasted
,
and
among
*NL*
the
rest
I
regularly
took
my
turn
of
duty
there
as
a
common
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
activity
in
these
operations
was
agreeable
to
the
governor
and
*NL*
council
;
they
took
me
into
confidence
,
and
I
was
consulted
by
them
in
*NL*
every
measure
wherein
their
concurrence
was
thought
useful
to
the
*NL*
association
.
Calling
in
the
aid
of
religion
,
I
propos
'd
to
them
the
*NL*
proclaiming
a
fast
,
to
promote
reformation
,
and
implore
the
blessing
of
*NL*
Heaven
on
our
undertaking
.
They
embrac
'd
the
motion
;
but
,
as
it
was
*NL*
the
first
fast
ever
thought
of
in
the
province
,
the
secretary
had
no
*NL*
precedent
from
which
to
draw
the
proclamation
.
My
education
in
New
*NL*
England
,
where
a
fast
is
proclaimed
every
year
,
was
here
of
some
*NL*
advantage
:
I
drew
it
in
the
accustomed
stile
,
it
was
translated
into
*NL*
German
,
printed
in
both
languages
,
and
divulg
'd
thro
'
the
province
.
*NL*
This
gave
the
clergy
of
the
different
sects
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
influencing
their
congregations
to
join
in
the
association
,
and
it
*NL*
would
probably
have
been
general
among
all
but
Quakers
if
the
peace
had
*NL*
not
soon
interven
'd
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thought
by
some
of
my
friends
that
,
by
my
activity
in
these
*NL*
affairs
,
I
should
offend
that
sect
,
and
thereby
lose
my
interest
in
the
*NL*
Assembly
of
the
province
,
where
they
formed
a
great
majority
.
A
young
*NL*
gentleman
who
had
likewise
some
friends
in
the
House
,
and
wished
to
*NL*
succeed
me
as
their
clerk
,
acquainted
me
that
it
was
decided
to
*NL*
displace
me
at
the
next
election
;
and
he
,
therefore
,
in
good
will
,
*NL*
advis
'd
me
to
resign
,
as
more
consistent
with
my
honour
than
being
*NL*
turn
'd
out
.
My
answer
to
him
was
,
that
I
had
read
or
heard
of
some
*NL*
public
man
who
made
it
a
rule
never
to
ask
for
an
office
,
and
never
to
*NL*
refuse
one
when
offer
'd
to
him
.
``
I
approve
,
''
says
I
,
``
of
his
rule
,
and
*NL*
will
practice
it
with
a
small
addition
;
I
shall
never
ask
,
never
*NL*
refuse
,
nor
ever
resign
an
office
.
If
they
will
have
my
office
of
*NL*
clerk
to
dispose
of
to
another
,
they
shall
take
it
from
me
.
I
will
*NL*
not
,
by
giving
it
up
,
lose
my
right
of
some
time
or
other
making
*NL*
reprisals
on
my
adversaries
.
''
I
heard
,
however
,
no
more
of
this
;
I
was
*NL*
chosen
again
unanimously
as
usual
at
the
next
election
.
Possibly
,
as
*NL*
they
dislik
'd
my
late
intimacy
with
the
members
of
council
,
who
had
*NL*
join
'd
the
governors
in
all
the
disputes
about
military
preparations
,
*NL*
with
which
the
House
had
long
been
harass
'd
,
they
might
have
been
*NL*
pleas
'd
if
I
would
voluntarily
have
left
them
;
but
they
did
not
care
to
*NL*
displace
me
on
account
merely
of
my
zeal
for
the
association
,
and
they
*NL*
could
not
well
give
another
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
I
had
some
cause
to
believe
that
the
defense
of
the
country
was
*NL*
not
disagreeable
to
any
of
them
,
provided
they
were
not
requir
'd
to
*NL*
assist
in
it
.
And
I
found
that
a
much
greater
number
of
them
than
I
*NL*
could
have
imagined
,
tho
'
against
offensive
war
,
were
clearly
for
the
*NL*
defensive
.
Many
pamphlets
pro
and
con
were
publish
'd
on
the
subject
,
*NL*
and
some
by
good
Quakers
,
in
favour
of
defense
,
which
I
believe
*NL*
convinc
'd
most
of
their
younger
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
transaction
in
our
fire
company
gave
me
some
insight
into
their
*NL*
prevailing
sentiments
.
It
had
been
propos
'd
that
we
should
encourage
*NL*
the
scheme
for
building
a
battery
by
laying
out
the
present
stock
,
then
*NL*
about
sixty
pounds
,
in
tickets
of
the
lottery
.
By
our
rules
,
no
money
*NL*
could
be
dispos
'd
of
till
the
next
meeting
after
the
proposal
.
The
*NL*
company
consisted
of
thirty
members
,
of
which
twenty-two
were
Quakers
,
*NL*
and
eight
only
of
other
persuasions
.
We
eight
punctually
attended
the
*NL*
meeting
;
but
,
tho
'
we
thought
that
some
of
the
Quakers
would
join
us
,
*NL*
we
were
by
no
means
sure
of
a
majority
.
Only
one
Quaker
,
Mr.
James
*NL*
Morris
,
appear
'd
to
oppose
the
measure
.
He
expressed
much
sorrow
that
*NL*
it
had
ever
been
propos
'd
,
as
he
said
Friends
were
all
against
it
,
and
*NL*
it
would
create
such
discord
as
might
break
up
the
company
.
We
told
*NL*
him
that
we
saw
no
reason
for
that
;
we
were
the
minority
,
and
if
*NL*
Friends
were
against
the
measure
,
and
outvoted
us
,
we
must
and
should
,
*NL*
agreeably
to
the
usage
of
all
societies
,
submit
.
When
the
hour
for
*NL*
business
arriv
'd
it
was
mov
'd
to
put
the
vote
;
he
allow
'd
we
might
then
*NL*
do
it
by
the
rules
,
but
,
as
he
could
assure
us
that
a
number
of
members
*NL*
intended
to
be
present
for
the
purpose
of
opposing
it
,
it
would
be
but
*NL*
candid
to
allow
a
little
time
for
their
appearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
disputing
this
,
a
waiter
came
to
tell
me
two
gentlemen
*NL*
below
desir
'd
to
speak
with
me
.
I
went
down
,
and
found
they
were
two
*NL*
of
our
Quaker
members
.
They
told
me
there
were
eight
of
them
assembled
*NL*
at
a
tavern
just
by
;
that
they
were
determin
'd
to
come
and
vote
with
us
*NL*
if
there
should
be
occasion
,
which
they
hop
'd
would
not
be
the
case
,
*NL*
and
desir
'd
we
would
not
call
for
their
assistance
if
we
could
do
*NL*
without
it
,
as
their
voting
for
such
a
measure
might
embroil
them
with
*NL*
their
elders
and
friends
.
Being
thus
secure
of
a
majority
,
I
went
up
,
*NL*
and
after
a
little
seeming
hesitation
,
agreed
to
a
delay
of
another
*NL*
hour
.
This
Mr.
Morris
allow
'd
to
be
extreamly
fair
.
Not
one
of
his
*NL*
opposing
friends
appear
'd
,
at
which
he
express
'd
great
surprize
;
and
,
*NL*
at
the
expiration
of
the
hour
,
we
carry
'd
the
resolution
eight
to
one
;
*NL*
and
as
,
of
the
twenty-two
Quakers
,
eight
were
ready
to
vote
with
us
,
*NL*
and
thirteen
,
by
their
absence
,
manifested
that
they
were
not
inclin
'd
*NL*
to
oppose
the
measure
,
I
afterward
estimated
the
proportion
of
Quakers
*NL*
sincerely
against
defense
as
one
to
twenty-one
only
;
for
these
were
all
*NL*
regular
members
of
that
society
,
and
in
good
reputation
among
them
,
and
*NL*
had
due
notice
of
what
was
propos
'd
at
that
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
honorable
and
learned
Mr.
Logan
,
who
had
always
been
of
that
sect
,
*NL*
was
one
who
wrote
an
address
to
them
,
declaring
his
approbation
of
*NL*
defensive
war
,
and
supporting
his
opinion
by
many
strong
arguments
.
He
*NL*
put
into
my
hands
sixty
pounds
to
be
laid
out
in
lottery
tickets
for
*NL*
the
battery
,
with
directions
to
apply
what
prizes
might
be
drawn
wholly
*NL*
to
that
service
.
He
told
me
the
following
anecdote
of
his
old
master
,
*NL*
William
Penn
,
respecting
defense
.
He
came
over
from
England
,
when
a
*NL*
young
man
,
with
that
proprietary
,
and
as
his
secretary
.
It
was
*NL*
war-time
,
and
their
ship
was
chas
'd
by
an
armed
vessel
,
suppos
'd
to
be
*NL*
an
enemy
.
Their
captain
prepar
'd
for
defense
;
but
told
William
Penn
*NL*
and
his
company
of
Quakers
,
that
he
did
not
expect
their
assistance
,
*NL*
and
they
might
retire
into
the
cabin
,
which
they
did
,
except
James
*NL*
Logan
,
who
chose
to
stay
upon
deck
,
and
was
quarter
'd
to
a
gun
.
The
*NL*
suppos
'd
enemy
prov
'd
a
friend
,
so
there
was
no
fighting
;
but
when
the
*NL*
secretary
went
down
to
communicate
the
intelligence
,
William
Penn
*NL*
rebuk
'd
him
severely
for
staying
upon
deck
,
and
undertaking
to
assist
*NL*
in
defending
the
vessel
,
contrary
to
the
principles
of
Friends
,
*NL*
especially
as
it
had
not
been
required
by
the
captain
.
This
reproof
,
*NL*
being
before
all
the
company
,
piqu
'd
the
secretary
,
who
answer
'd
,
``
I
*NL*
being
thy
servant
,
why
did
thee
not
order
me
to
come
down
?
But
thee
*NL*
was
willing
enough
that
I
should
stay
and
help
to
fight
the
ship
when
*NL*
thee
thought
there
was
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
being
many
years
in
the
Assembly
,
the
majority
of
which
were
*NL*
constantly
Quakers
,
gave
me
frequent
opportunities
of
seeing
the
*NL*
embarrassment
given
them
by
their
principle
against
war
,
whenever
*NL*
application
was
made
to
them
,
by
order
of
the
crown
,
to
grant
aids
for
*NL*
military
purposes
.
They
were
unwilling
to
offend
government
,
on
the
*NL*
one
hand
,
by
a
direct
refusal
;
and
their
friends
,
the
body
of
the
*NL*
Quakers
,
on
the
other
,
by
a
compliance
contrary
to
their
principles
;
*NL*
hence
a
variety
of
evasions
to
avoid
complying
,
and
modes
of
disguising
*NL*
the
compliance
when
it
became
unavoidable
.
The
common
mode
at
last
*NL*
was
,
to
grant
money
under
the
phrase
of
its
being
``
for
the
king
's
use
,
''
*NL*
and
never
to
inquire
how
it
was
applied
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
if
the
demand
was
not
directly
from
the
crown
,
that
phrase
was
*NL*
found
not
so
proper
,
and
some
other
was
to
be
invented
.
As
,
when
*NL*
powder
was
wanting
-LRB-
I
think
it
was
for
the
garrison
at
Louisburg
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
the
government
of
New
England
solicited
a
grant
of
some
from
*NL*
Pennsilvania
,
which
was
much
urg
'd
on
the
House
by
Governor
Thomas
,
*NL*
they
could
not
grant
money
to
buy
powder
,
because
that
was
an
*NL*
ingredient
of
war
;
but
they
voted
an
aid
to
New
England
of
three
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
to
be
put
into
the
hands
of
the
governor
,
and
*NL*
appropriated
it
for
the
purchasing
of
bread
,
flour
,
wheat
,
or
other
*NL*
grain
.
Some
of
the
council
,
desirous
of
giving
the
House
still
further
*NL*
embarrassment
,
advis
'd
the
governor
not
to
accept
provision
,
as
not
*NL*
being
the
thing
he
had
demanded
;
but
be
reply
'd
,
``
I
shall
take
the
*NL*
money
,
for
I
understand
very
well
their
meaning
;
other
grain
is
*NL*
gunpowder
,
''
which
he
accordingly
bought
,
and
they
never
objected
to
*NL*
it
.

It
was
in
allusion
to
this
fact
that
,
when
in
our
fire
company
we
*NL*
feared
the
success
of
our
proposal
in
favour
of
the
lottery
,
and
I
had
*NL*
said
to
my
friend
Mr.
Syng
,
one
of
our
members
,
``
If
we
fail
,
let
us
*NL*
move
the
purchase
of
a
fire-engine
with
the
money
;
the
Quakers
can
have
*NL*
no
objection
to
that
;
and
then
,
if
you
nominate
me
and
I
you
as
a
*NL*
committee
for
that
purpose
,
we
will
buy
a
great
gun
,
which
is
certainly
*NL*
a
fire-engine
.
''
``
I
see
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
have
improv
'd
by
being
so
long
*NL*
in
the
Assembly
;
your
equivocal
project
would
be
just
a
match
for
their
*NL*
wheat
or
other
grain
.

*NL*
These
embarrassments
that
the
Quakers
suffer
'd
from
having
establish
'd
*NL*
and
published
it
as
one
of
their
principles
that
no
kind
of
war
was
*NL*
lawful
,
and
which
,
being
once
published
,
they
could
not
afterwards
,
*NL*
however
they
might
change
their
minds
,
easily
get
rid
of
,
reminds
me
of
*NL*
what
I
think
a
more
prudent
conduct
in
another
sect
among
us
,
that
of
*NL*
the
Dunkers
.
I
was
acquainted
with
one
of
its
founders
,
Michael
*NL*
Welfare
,
soon
after
it
appear
'd
.
He
complain
'd
to
me
that
they
were
*NL*
grievously
calumniated
by
the
zealots
of
other
persuasions
,
and
charg
'd
*NL*
with
abominable
principles
and
practices
,
to
which
they
were
utter
*NL*
strangers
.
I
told
him
this
had
always
been
the
case
with
new
sects
,
*NL*
and
that
,
to
put
a
stop
to
such
abuse
,
I
imagin
'd
it
might
be
well
to
*NL*
publish
the
articles
of
their
belief
,
and
the
rules
of
their
*NL*
discipline
.
He
said
that
it
had
been
propos
'd
among
them
,
but
not
*NL*
agreed
to
,
for
this
reason
:
``
When
we
were
first
drawn
together
as
a
*NL*
society
,
''
says
he
,
``
it
had
pleased
God
to
enlighten
our
minds
so
far
as
*NL*
to
see
that
some
doctrines
,
which
we
once
esteemed
truths
,
were
errors
;
*NL*
and
that
others
,
which
we
had
esteemed
errors
,
were
real
truths
.
From
*NL*
time
to
time
He
has
been
pleased
to
afford
us
farther
light
,
and
our
*NL*
principles
have
been
improving
,
and
our
errors
diminishing
.
Now
we
are
*NL*
not
sure
that
we
are
arrived
at
the
end
of
this
progression
,
and
at
the
*NL*
perfection
of
spiritual
or
theological
knowledge
;
and
we
fear
that
,
if
*NL*
we
should
once
print
our
confession
of
faith
,
we
should
feel
ourselves
*NL*
as
if
bound
and
confin
'd
by
it
,
and
perhaps
be
unwilling
to
receive
*NL*
farther
improvement
,
and
our
successors
still
more
so
,
as
conceiving
*NL*
what
we
their
elders
and
founders
had
done
,
to
be
something
sacred
,
*NL*
never
to
be
departed
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
modesty
in
a
sect
is
perhaps
a
singular
instance
in
the
history
of
*NL*
mankind
,
every
other
sect
supposing
itself
in
possession
of
all
truth
,
*NL*
and
that
those
who
differ
are
so
far
in
the
wrong
;
like
a
man
traveling
*NL*
in
foggy
weather
,
those
at
some
distance
before
him
on
the
road
he
sees
*NL*
wrapped
up
in
the
fog
,
as
well
as
those
behind
him
,
and
also
the
people
*NL*
in
the
fields
on
each
side
,
but
near
him
all
appears
clear
,
tho
'
in
*NL*
truth
he
is
as
much
in
the
fog
as
any
of
them
.
To
avoid
this
kind
of
*NL*
embarrassment
,
the
Quakers
have
of
late
years
been
gradually
declining
*NL*
the
public
service
in
the
Assembly
and
in
the
magistracy
,
choosing
*NL*
rather
to
quit
their
power
than
their
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
of
time
,
I
should
have
mentioned
before
,
that
having
,
in
1742
,
*NL*
invented
an
open
stove
for
the
better
warming
of
rooms
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
saving
fuel
,
as
the
fresh
air
admitted
was
warmed
in
entering
,
I
*NL*
made
a
present
of
the
model
to
Mr.
Robert
Grace
,
one
of
my
early
*NL*
friends
,
who
,
having
an
iron-furnace
,
found
the
casting
of
the
plates
*NL*
for
these
stoves
a
profitable
thing
,
as
they
were
growing
in
demand
.
*NL*
To
promote
that
demand
,
I
wrote
and
published
a
pamphlet
,
entitled
``
An
*NL*
Account
of
the
new-invented
Pennsylvania
Fireplaces
;
wherein
their
*NL*
Construction
and
Manner
of
Operation
is
particularly
explained
;
their
*NL*
Advantages
above
every
other
Method
of
warming
Rooms
demonstrated
;
and
*NL*
all
Objections
that
have
been
raised
against
the
Use
of
them
answered
*NL*
and
obviated
,
''
etc.
.
This
pamphlet
had
a
good
effect
.
Gov
`
r.
Thomas
*NL*
was
so
pleas
'd
with
the
construction
of
this
stove
,
as
described
in
it
,
*NL*
that
he
offered
to
give
me
a
patent
for
the
sole
vending
of
them
for
a
*NL*
term
of
years
;
but
I
declin
'd
it
from
a
principle
which
has
ever
*NL*
weighed
with
me
on
such
occasions
,
viz.
,
That
,
as
we
enjoy
great
*NL*
advantages
from
the
inventions
of
others
,
we
should
be
glad
of
an
*NL*
opportunity
to
serve
others
by
any
invention
of
ours
;
and
this
we
*NL*
should
do
freely
and
generously
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
ironmonger
in
London
however
,
assuming
a
good
deal
of
my
pamphlet
,
*NL*
and
working
it
up
into
his
own
,
and
making
some
small
changes
in
the
*NL*
machine
,
which
rather
hurt
its
operation
,
got
a
patent
for
it
there
,
*NL*
and
made
,
as
I
was
told
,
a
little
fortune
by
it
.
And
this
is
not
the
*NL*
only
instance
of
patents
taken
out
for
my
inventions
by
others
,
tho
'
*NL*
not
always
with
the
same
success
,
which
I
never
contested
,
as
having
no
*NL*
desire
of
profiting
by
patents
myself
,
and
hating
disputes
.
The
use
of
*NL*
these
fireplaces
in
very
many
houses
,
both
of
this
and
the
neighbouring
*NL*
colonies
,
has
been
,
and
is
,
a
great
saving
of
wood
to
the
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peace
being
concluded
,
and
the
association
business
therefore
at
an
*NL*
end
,
I
turn
'd
my
thoughts
again
to
the
affair
of
establishing
an
*NL*
academy
.
The
first
step
I
took
was
to
associate
in
the
design
a
number
*NL*
of
active
friends
,
of
whom
the
Junto
furnished
a
good
part
;
the
next
*NL*
was
to
write
and
publish
a
pamphlet
,
entitled
Proposals
Relating
to
the
*NL*
Education
of
Youth
in
Pennsylvania
.
This
I
distributed
among
the
*NL*
principal
inhabitants
gratis
;
and
as
soon
as
I
could
suppose
their
*NL*
minds
a
little
prepared
by
the
perusal
of
it
,
I
set
on
foot
a
*NL*
subscription
for
opening
and
supporting
an
academy
;
it
was
to
be
paid
*NL*
in
quotas
yearly
for
five
years
;
by
so
dividing
it
,
I
judg
'd
the
*NL*
subscription
might
be
larger
,
and
I
believe
it
was
so
,
amounting
to
no
*NL*
less
,
if
I
remember
right
,
than
five
thousand
pounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
introduction
to
these
proposals
,
I
stated
their
publication
,
not
*NL*
as
an
act
of
mine
,
but
of
some
publick-spirited
gentlemen
,
avoiding
as
*NL*
much
as
I
could
,
according
to
my
usual
rule
,
the
presenting
myself
to
*NL*
the
publick
as
the
author
of
any
scheme
for
their
benefit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subscribers
,
to
carry
the
project
into
immediate
execution
,
chose
*NL*
out
of
their
number
twenty-four
trustees
,
and
appointed
Mr.
Francis
,
*NL*
then
attorney-general
,
and
myself
to
draw
up
constitutions
for
the
*NL*
government
of
the
academy
;
which
being
done
and
signed
,
a
house
was
*NL*
hired
,
masters
engag
'd
,
and
the
schools
opened
,
I
think
,
in
the
same
*NL*
year
,
1749
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scholars
increasing
fast
,
the
house
was
soon
found
too
small
,
and
*NL*
we
were
looking
out
for
a
piece
of
ground
,
properly
situated
,
with
*NL*
intention
to
build
,
when
Providence
threw
into
our
way
a
large
house
*NL*
ready
built
,
which
,
with
a
few
alterations
,
might
well
serve
our
*NL*
purpose
.
This
was
the
building
before
mentioned
,
erected
by
the
*NL*
hearers
of
Mr.
Whitefield
,
and
was
obtained
for
us
in
the
following
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
to
be
noted
that
the
contributions
to
this
building
being
made
by
*NL*
people
of
different
sects
,
care
was
taken
in
the
nomination
of
*NL*
trustees
,
in
whom
the
building
and
ground
was
to
be
vested
,
that
a
*NL*
predominancy
should
not
be
given
to
any
sect
,
lest
in
time
that
*NL*
predominancy
might
be
a
means
of
appropriating
the
whole
to
the
use
of
*NL*
such
sect
,
contrary
to
the
original
intention
.
It
was
therefore
that
*NL*
one
of
each
sect
was
appointed
,
viz.
,
one
Church-of-England
man
,
one
*NL*
Presbyterian
,
one
Baptist
,
one
Moravian
,
etc.
,
those
,
in
case
of
*NL*
vacancy
by
death
,
were
to
fill
it
by
election
from
among
the
*NL*
contributors
.
The
Moravian
happen
'd
not
to
please
his
colleagues
,
and
*NL*
on
his
death
they
resolved
to
have
no
other
of
that
sect
.
The
*NL*
difficulty
then
was
,
how
to
avoid
having
two
of
some
other
sect
,
by
*NL*
means
of
the
new
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
persons
were
named
,
and
for
that
reason
not
agreed
to
.
At
*NL*
length
one
mention
'd
me
,
with
the
observation
that
I
was
merely
an
*NL*
honest
man
,
and
of
no
sect
at
all
,
which
prevail
'd
with
them
to
chuse
*NL*
me
.
The
enthusiasm
which
existed
when
the
house
was
built
had
long
*NL*
since
abated
,
and
its
trustees
had
not
been
able
to
procure
fresh
*NL*
contributions
for
paying
the
ground-rent
,
and
discharging
some
other
*NL*
debts
the
building
had
occasion
'd
,
which
embarrass
'd
them
greatly
.
*NL*
Being
now
a
member
of
both
sets
of
trustees
,
that
for
the
building
and
*NL*
that
for
the
Academy
,
I
had
a
good
opportunity
of
negotiating
with
*NL*
both
,
and
brought
them
finally
to
an
agreement
,
by
which
the
trustees
*NL*
for
the
building
were
to
cede
it
to
those
of
the
academy
,
the
latter
*NL*
undertaking
to
discharge
the
debt
,
to
keep
for
ever
open
in
the
*NL*
building
a
large
hall
for
occasional
preachers
,
according
to
the
*NL*
original
intention
,
and
maintain
a
free
school
for
the
instruction
of
*NL*
poor
children
.
Writings
were
accordingly
drawn
,
and
on
paying
the
*NL*
debts
the
trustees
of
the
academy
were
put
in
possession
of
the
*NL*
premises
;
and
by
dividing
the
great
and
lofty
hall
into
stories
,
and
*NL*
different
rooms
above
and
below
for
the
several
schools
,
and
purchasing
*NL*
some
additional
ground
,
the
whole
was
soon
made
fit
for
our
purpose
,
*NL*
and
the
scholars
remov
'd
into
the
building
.
The
care
and
trouble
of
*NL*
agreeing
with
the
workmen
,
purchasing
materials
,
and
superintending
the
*NL*
work
,
fell
upon
me
;
and
I
went
thro
'
it
the
more
cheerfully
,
as
it
did
*NL*
not
then
interfere
with
my
private
business
,
having
the
year
before
*NL*
taken
a
very
able
,
industrious
,
and
honest
partner
,
Mr.
David
Hall
,
*NL*
with
whose
character
I
was
well
acquainted
,
as
he
had
work
'd
for
me
*NL*
four
years
.
He
took
off
my
hands
all
care
of
the
printing-office
,
*NL*
paying
me
punctually
my
share
of
the
profits
.
This
partnership
*NL*
continued
eighteen
years
,
successfully
for
us
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trustees
of
the
academy
,
after
a
while
,
were
incorporated
by
a
*NL*
charter
from
the
governor
;
their
funds
were
increas
'd
by
contributions
*NL*
in
Britain
and
grants
of
land
from
the
proprietaries
,
to
which
the
*NL*
Assembly
has
since
made
considerable
addition
;
and
thus
was
established
*NL*
the
present
University
of
Philadelphia
.
I
have
been
continued
one
of
*NL*
its
trustees
from
the
beginning
,
now
near
forty
years
,
and
have
had
the
*NL*
very
great
pleasure
of
seeing
a
number
of
the
youth
who
have
receiv
'd
*NL*
their
education
in
it
,
distinguish
'd
by
their
improv
'd
abilities
,
*NL*
serviceable
in
public
stations
and
ornaments
to
their
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
disengaged
myself
,
as
above
mentioned
,
from
private
business
,
I
*NL*
flatter
'd
myself
that
,
by
the
sufficient
tho
'
moderate
fortune
I
had
*NL*
acquir
'd
,
I
had
secured
leisure
during
the
rest
of
my
life
for
*NL*
philosophical
studies
and
amusements
.
I
purchased
all
Dr.
Spence
's
*NL*
apparatus
,
who
had
come
from
England
to
lecture
here
,
and
I
proceeded
*NL*
in
my
electrical
experiments
with
great
alacrity
;
but
the
publick
,
now
*NL*
considering
me
as
a
man
of
leisure
,
laid
hold
of
me
for
their
purposes
,
*NL*
every
part
of
our
civil
government
,
and
almost
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
imposing
some
duty
upon
me
.
The
governor
put
me
into
the
commission
of
*NL*
the
peace
;
the
corporation
of
the
city
chose
me
of
the
common
council
,
*NL*
and
soon
after
an
alderman
;
and
the
citizens
at
large
chose
me
a
*NL*
burgess
to
represent
them
in
Assembly
.
This
latter
station
was
the
*NL*
more
agreeable
to
me
,
as
I
was
at
length
tired
with
sitting
there
to
*NL*
hear
debates
,
in
which
,
as
clerk
,
I
could
take
no
part
,
and
which
were
*NL*
often
so
unentertaining
that
I
was
induc
'd
to
amuse
myself
with
making
*NL*
magic
squares
or
circles
,
or
any
thing
to
avoid
weariness
;
and
I
*NL*
conceiv
'd
my
becoming
a
member
would
enlarge
my
power
of
doing
good
.
I
*NL*
would
not
,
however
,
insinuate
that
my
ambition
was
not
flatter
'd
by
all
*NL*
these
promotions
;
it
certainly
was
;
for
,
considering
my
low
beginning
,
*NL*
they
were
great
things
to
me
;
and
they
were
still
more
pleasing
,
as
*NL*
being
so
many
spontaneous
testimonies
of
the
public
good
opinion
,
and
*NL*
by
me
entirely
unsolicited
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
office
of
justice
of
the
peace
I
try
'd
a
little
,
by
attending
a
few
*NL*
courts
,
and
sitting
on
the
bench
to
hear
causes
;
but
finding
that
more
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
common
law
than
I
possess
'd
was
necessary
to
act
in
*NL*
that
station
with
credit
,
I
gradually
withdrew
from
it
,
excusing
myself
*NL*
by
my
being
oblig
'd
to
attend
the
higher
duties
of
a
legislator
in
the
*NL*
Assembly
.
My
election
to
this
trust
was
repeated
every
year
for
ten
*NL*
years
,
without
my
ever
asking
any
elector
for
his
vote
,
or
signifying
,
*NL*
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
any
desire
of
being
chosen
.
On
taking
*NL*
my
seat
in
the
House
,
my
son
was
appointed
their
clerk
.

The
year
following
,
a
treaty
being
to
be
held
with
the
Indians
at
*NL*
Carlisle
,
the
governor
sent
a
message
to
the
House
,
proposing
that
they
*NL*
should
nominate
some
of
their
members
,
to
be
join
'd
with
some
members
*NL*
of
council
,
as
commissioners
for
that
purpose
.

As
those
people
are
extreamly
apt
to
get
drunk
,
and
,
when
so
,
are
very
*NL*
quarrelsome
and
disorderly
,
we
strictly
forbad
the
selling
any
liquor
*NL*
to
them
;
and
when
they
complain
'd
of
this
restriction
,
we
told
them
*NL*
that
if
they
would
continue
sober
during
the
treaty
,
we
would
give
them
*NL*
plenty
of
rum
when
business
was
over
.
They
promis
'd
this
,
and
they
*NL*
kept
their
promise
,
because
they
could
get
no
liquor
,
and
the
treaty
*NL*
was
conducted
very
orderly
,
and
concluded
to
mutual
satisfaction
.
They
*NL*
then
claim
'd
and
receiv
'd
the
rum
;
this
was
in
the
afternoon
;
they
were
*NL*
near
one
hundred
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
and
were
lodg
'd
in
temporary
*NL*
cabins
,
built
in
the
form
of
a
square
,
just
without
the
town
.
In
the
*NL*
evening
,
hearing
a
great
noise
among
them
,
the
commissioners
walk
'd
out
*NL*
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
We
found
they
had
made
a
great
bonfire
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
square
;
they
were
all
drunk
,
men
and
women
,
*NL*
quarreling
and
fighting
.
Their
dark-colour
'd
bodies
,
half
naked
,
seen
*NL*
only
by
the
gloomy
light
of
the
bonfire
,
running
after
and
beating
one
*NL*
another
with
firebrands
,
accompanied
by
their
horrid
yellings
,
form
'd
a
*NL*
scene
the
most
resembling
our
ideas
of
hell
that
could
well
be
*NL*
imagin
'd
;
there
was
no
appeasing
the
tumult
,
and
we
retired
to
our
*NL*
lodging
.
At
midnight
a
number
of
them
came
thundering
at
our
door
,
*NL*
demanding
more
rum
,
of
which
we
took
no
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
sensible
they
had
misbehav
'd
in
giving
us
that
*NL*
disturbance
,
they
sent
three
of
their
old
counselors
to
make
their
*NL*
apology
.
The
orator
acknowledg
'd
the
fault
,
but
laid
it
upon
the
rum
;
*NL*
and
then
endeavored
to
excuse
the
rum
by
saying
,
``
The
Great
Spirit
,
who
*NL*
made
all
things
,
made
every
thing
for
some
use
,
and
whatever
use
he
*NL*
design
'd
any
thing
for
,
that
use
it
should
always
be
put
to
.
Now
,
when
*NL*
he
made
rum
,
he
said
`
Let
this
be
for
the
Indians
to
get
drunk
with
,
'
*NL*
and
it
must
be
so
.
''
And
,
indeed
,
if
it
be
the
design
of
Providence
to
*NL*
extirpate
these
savages
in
order
to
make
room
for
cultivators
of
the
*NL*
earth
,
it
seems
not
improbable
that
rum
may
be
the
appointed
means
.
It
*NL*
has
already
annihilated
all
the
tribes
who
formerly
inhabited
the
*NL*
sea-coast
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1751
,
Dr.
Thomas
Bond
,
a
particular
friend
of
mine
,
conceived
the
*NL*
idea
of
establishing
a
hospital
in
Philadelphia
-LRB-
a
very
beneficent
*NL*
design
,
which
has
been
ascrib
'd
to
me
,
but
was
originally
his
-RRB-
,
for
the
*NL*
reception
and
cure
of
poor
sick
persons
,
whether
inhabitants
of
the
*NL*
province
or
strangers
.
He
was
zealous
and
active
in
endeavouring
to
*NL*
procure
subscriptions
for
it
,
but
the
proposal
being
a
novelty
in
*NL*
America
,
and
at
first
not
well
understood
,
he
met
with
but
small
*NL*
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
came
to
me
with
the
compliment
that
he
found
there
was
no
*NL*
such
thing
as
carrying
a
public-spirited
project
through
without
my
*NL*
being
concern
'd
in
it
.
``
For
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
am
often
ask
'd
by
those
to
*NL*
whom
I
propose
subscribing
,
Have
you
consulted
Franklin
upon
this
*NL*
business
?
And
what
does
he
think
of
it
?
And
when
I
tell
them
that
I
*NL*
have
not
-LRB-
supposing
it
rather
out
of
your
line
-RRB-
,
they
do
not
subscribe
,
*NL*
but
say
they
will
consider
of
it
.
''
I
enquired
into
the
nature
and
*NL*
probable
utility
of
his
scheme
,
and
receiving
from
him
a
very
*NL*
satisfactory
explanation
,
I
not
only
subscrib
'd
to
it
myself
,
but
*NL*
engag
'd
heartily
in
the
design
of
procuring
subscriptions
from
others
.
*NL*
Previously
,
however
,
to
the
solicitation
,
I
endeavoured
to
prepare
the
*NL*
minds
of
the
people
by
writing
on
the
subject
in
the
newspapers
,
which
*NL*
was
my
usual
custom
in
such
cases
,
but
which
he
had
omitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subscriptions
afterwards
were
more
free
and
generous
;
but
,
*NL*
beginning
to
flag
,
I
saw
they
would
be
insufficient
without
some
*NL*
assistance
from
the
Assembly
,
and
therefore
propos
'd
to
petition
for
*NL*
it
,
which
was
done
.
The
country
members
did
not
at
first
relish
the
*NL*
project
;
they
objected
that
it
could
only
be
serviceable
to
the
city
,
*NL*
and
therefore
the
citizens
alone
should
be
at
the
expense
of
it
;
and
*NL*
they
doubted
whether
the
citizens
themselves
generally
approv
'd
of
it
.
*NL*
My
allegation
on
the
contrary
,
that
it
met
with
such
approbation
as
to
*NL*
leave
no
doubt
of
our
being
able
to
raise
two
thousand
pounds
by
*NL*
voluntary
donations
,
they
considered
as
a
most
extravagant
supposition
,
*NL*
and
utterly
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
I
form
'd
my
plan
;
and
asking
leave
to
bring
in
a
bill
for
*NL*
incorporating
the
contributors
according
to
the
prayer
of
their
*NL*
petition
,
and
granting
them
a
blank
sum
of
money
,
which
leave
was
*NL*
obtained
chiefly
on
the
consideration
that
the
House
could
throw
the
*NL*
bill
out
if
they
did
not
like
it
,
I
drew
it
so
as
to
make
the
important
*NL*
clause
a
conditional
one
,
viz.
,
``
And
be
it
enacted
,
by
the
authority
*NL*
aforesaid
,
that
when
the
said
contributors
shall
have
met
and
chosen
*NL*
their
managers
and
treasurer
,
and
shall
have
raised
by
their
*NL*
contributions
a
capital
stock
of
-----
value
-LRB-
the
yearly
interest
of
*NL*
which
is
to
be
applied
to
the
accommodating
of
the
sick
poor
in
the
*NL*
said
hospital
,
free
of
charge
for
diet
,
attendance
,
advice
,
and
*NL*
medicines
-RRB-
,
and
shall
make
the
same
appear
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
*NL*
speaker
of
the
Assembly
for
the
time
being
,
that
then
it
shall
and
may
*NL*
be
lawful
for
the
said
speaker
,
and
he
is
hereby
required
,
to
sign
an
*NL*
order
on
the
provincial
treasurer
for
the
payment
of
two
thousand
*NL*
pounds
,
in
two
yearly
payments
,
to
the
treasurer
of
the
said
hospital
,
*NL*
to
be
applied
to
the
founding
,
building
,
and
finishing
of
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
condition
carried
the
bill
through
;
for
the
members
,
who
had
*NL*
oppos
'd
the
grant
,
and
now
conceiv
'd
they
might
have
the
credit
of
*NL*
being
charitable
without
the
expence
,
agreed
to
its
passage
;
and
then
,
*NL*
in
soliciting
subscriptions
among
the
people
,
we
urg
'd
the
conditional
*NL*
promise
of
the
law
as
an
additional
motive
to
give
,
since
every
man
's
*NL*
donation
would
be
doubled
;
thus
the
clause
work
'd
both
ways
.
The
*NL*
subscriptions
accordingly
soon
exceeded
the
requisite
sum
,
and
we
*NL*
claim
'd
and
receiv
'd
the
public
gift
,
which
enabled
us
to
carry
the
*NL*
design
into
execution
.
A
convenient
and
handsome
building
was
soon
*NL*
erected
;
the
institution
has
by
constant
experience
been
found
useful
,
*NL*
and
flourishes
to
this
day
;
and
I
do
not
remember
any
of
my
political
*NL*
manoeuvres
,
the
success
of
which
gave
me
at
the
time
more
pleasure
,
or
*NL*
wherein
,
after
thinking
of
it
,
I
more
easily
excus
'd
myself
for
having
*NL*
made
some
use
of
cunning
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
this
time
that
another
projector
,
the
Rev.
Gilbert
*NL*
Tennent
,
came
to
me
with
a
request
that
I
would
assist
him
in
procuring
*NL*
a
subscription
for
erecting
a
new
meeting-house
.
It
was
to
be
for
the
*NL*
use
of
a
congregation
he
had
gathered
among
the
Presbyterians
,
who
were
*NL*
originally
disciples
of
Mr.
Whitefield
.
Unwilling
to
make
myself
*NL*
disagreeable
to
my
fellow-citizens
by
too
frequently
soliciting
their
*NL*
contributions
,
I
absolutely
refus
'd
.
He
then
desired
I
would
furnish
*NL*
him
with
a
list
of
the
names
of
persons
I
knew
by
experience
to
be
*NL*
generous
and
public-spirited
.
I
thought
it
would
be
unbecoming
in
me
,
*NL*
after
their
kind
compliance
with
my
solicitations
,
to
mark
them
out
to
*NL*
be
worried
by
other
beggars
,
and
therefore
refus
'd
also
to
give
such
a
*NL*
list
.
He
then
desir
'd
I
would
at
least
give
him
my
advice
.
``
That
I
*NL*
will
readily
do
,
''
said
I
;
``
and
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
advise
you
to
*NL*
apply
to
all
those
whom
you
know
will
give
something
;
next
,
to
those
*NL*
whom
you
are
uncertain
whether
they
will
give
any
thing
or
not
,
and
*NL*
show
them
the
list
of
those
who
have
given
;
and
,
lastly
,
do
not
neglect
*NL*
those
who
you
are
sure
will
give
nothing
,
for
in
some
of
them
you
may
*NL*
be
mistaken
.
''
He
laugh
'd
and
thank
'd
me
,
and
said
he
would
take
my
*NL*
advice
.
He
did
so
,
for
he
ask
'd
of
everybody
,
and
he
obtained
a
much
*NL*
larger
sum
than
he
expected
,
with
which
he
erected
the
capacious
and
*NL*
very
elegant
meeting-house
that
stands
in
Arch-street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
city
,
tho
'
laid
out
with
a
beautiful
regularity
,
the
streets
large
,
*NL*
strait
,
and
crossing
each
other
at
right
angles
,
had
the
disgrace
of
*NL*
suffering
those
streets
to
remain
long
unpav
'd
,
and
in
wet
weather
the
*NL*
wheels
of
heavy
carriages
plough
'd
them
into
a
quagmire
,
so
that
it
was
*NL*
difficult
to
cross
them
;
and
in
dry
weather
the
dust
was
offensive
.
I
*NL*
had
liv
'd
near
what
was
call
'd
the
Jersey
Market
,
and
saw
with
pain
the
*NL*
inhabitants
wading
in
mud
while
purchasing
their
provisions
.
A
strip
*NL*
of
ground
down
the
middle
of
that
market
was
at
length
pav
'd
with
*NL*
brick
,
so
that
,
being
once
in
the
market
,
they
had
firm
footing
,
but
*NL*
were
often
over
shoes
in
dirt
to
get
there
.
By
talking
and
writing
on
*NL*
the
subject
,
I
was
at
length
instrumental
in
getting
the
street
pav
'd
*NL*
with
stone
between
the
market
and
the
brick
'd
foot-pavement
,
that
was
*NL*
on
each
side
next
the
houses
.
This
,
for
some
time
,
gave
an
easy
access
*NL*
to
the
market
dry-shod
;
but
,
the
rest
of
the
street
not
being
pav
'd
,
*NL*
whenever
a
carriage
came
out
of
the
mud
upon
this
pavement
,
it
shook
*NL*
off
and
left
its
dirt
upon
it
,
and
it
was
soon
cover
'd
with
mire
,
which
*NL*
was
not
remov
'd
,
the
city
as
yet
having
no
scavengers
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
inquiry
I
found
a
poor
industrious
man
,
who
was
willing
to
*NL*
undertake
keeping
the
pavement
clean
,
by
sweeping
it
twice
a
week
,
*NL*
carrying
off
the
dirt
from
before
all
the
neighbours
'
doors
,
for
the
*NL*
sum
of
sixpence
per
month
,
to
be
paid
by
each
house
.
I
then
wrote
and
*NL*
printed
a
paper
setting
forth
the
advantages
to
the
neighbourhood
that
*NL*
might
be
obtain
'd
by
this
small
expense
;
the
greater
ease
in
keeping
*NL*
our
houses
clean
,
so
much
dirt
not
being
brought
in
by
people
's
feet
;
*NL*
the
benefit
to
the
shops
by
more
custom
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
as
buyers
could
*NL*
more
easily
get
at
them
;
and
by
not
having
,
in
windy
weather
,
the
dust
*NL*
blown
in
upon
their
goods
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
I
sent
one
of
these
papers
to
*NL*
each
house
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
went
round
to
see
who
would
subscribe
*NL*
an
agreement
to
pay
these
sixpences
;
it
was
unanimously
sign
'd
,
and
for
*NL*
a
time
well
executed
.
All
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
were
delighted
*NL*
with
the
cleanliness
of
the
pavement
that
surrounded
the
market
,
it
*NL*
being
a
convenience
to
all
,
and
this
rais
'd
a
general
desire
to
have
*NL*
all
the
streets
paved
,
and
made
the
people
more
willing
to
submit
to
a
*NL*
tax
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
time
I
drew
a
bill
for
paving
the
city
,
and
brought
it
into
*NL*
the
Assembly
.
It
was
just
before
I
went
to
England
,
in
1757
,
and
did
*NL*
not
pass
till
I
was
gone
.
-LSB-
12
-RSB-
and
then
with
an
alteration
in
the
mode
*NL*
of
assessment
,
which
I
thought
not
for
the
better
,
but
with
an
*NL*
additional
provision
for
lighting
as
well
as
paving
the
streets
,
which
*NL*
was
a
great
improvement
.
It
was
by
a
private
person
,
the
late
Mr.
John
*NL*
Clifton
,
his
giving
a
sample
of
the
utility
of
lamps
,
by
placing
one
at
*NL*
his
door
,
that
the
people
were
first
impress
'd
with
the
idea
of
*NL*
enlighting
all
the
city
.
The
honour
of
this
public
benefit
has
also
*NL*
been
ascrib
'd
to
me
but
it
belongs
truly
to
that
gentleman
.
I
did
but
*NL*
follow
his
example
,
and
have
only
some
merit
to
claim
respecting
the
*NL*
form
of
our
lamps
,
as
differing
from
the
globe
lamps
we
were
at
first
*NL*
supply
'd
with
from
London
.
Those
we
found
inconvenient
in
these
*NL*
respects
:
they
admitted
no
air
below
;
the
smoke
,
therefore
,
did
not
*NL*
readily
go
out
above
,
but
circulated
in
the
globe
,
lodg
'd
on
its
*NL*
inside
,
and
soon
obstructed
the
light
they
were
intended
to
afford
;
*NL*
giving
,
besides
,
the
daily
trouble
of
wiping
them
clean
;
and
an
*NL*
accidental
stroke
on
one
of
them
would
demolish
it
,
and
render
it
*NL*
totally
useless
.
I
therefore
suggested
the
composing
them
of
four
flat
*NL*
panes
,
with
a
long
funnel
above
to
draw
up
the
smoke
,
and
crevices
*NL*
admitting
air
below
,
to
facilitate
the
ascent
of
the
smoke
;
by
this
*NL*
means
they
were
kept
clean
,
and
did
not
grow
dark
in
a
few
hours
,
as
*NL*
the
London
lamps
do
,
but
continu
'd
bright
till
morning
,
and
an
*NL*
accidental
stroke
would
generally
break
but
a
single
pane
,
easily
*NL*
repair
'd
.

*NL*
*NL*
I
have
sometimes
wonder
'd
that
the
Londoners
did
not
,
from
the
effect
*NL*
holes
in
the
bottom
of
the
globe
lamps
us
'd
at
Vauxhall
have
in
keeping
*NL*
them
clean
,
learn
to
have
such
holes
in
their
street
lamps
.
But
,
these
*NL*
holes
being
made
for
another
purpose
,
viz.
,
to
communicate
flame
more
*NL*
suddenly
to
the
wick
by
a
little
flax
hanging
down
thro
'
them
,
the
*NL*
other
use
,
of
letting
in
air
,
seems
not
to
have
been
thought
of
;
and
*NL*
therefore
,
after
the
lamps
have
been
lit
a
few
hours
,
the
streets
of
*NL*
London
are
very
poorly
illuminated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mention
of
these
improvements
puts
me
in
mind
of
one
I
propos
'd
,
*NL*
when
in
London
,
to
Dr.
Fothergill
,
who
was
among
the
best
men
I
have
*NL*
known
,
and
a
great
promoter
of
useful
projects
.
I
had
observ
'd
that
*NL*
the
streets
,
when
dry
,
were
never
swept
,
and
the
light
dust
carried
*NL*
away
;
but
it
was
suffer
'd
to
accumulate
till
wet
weather
reduc
'd
it
to
*NL*
mud
,
and
then
,
after
lying
some
days
so
deep
on
the
pavement
that
there
*NL*
was
no
crossing
but
in
paths
kept
clean
by
poor
people
with
brooms
,
it
*NL*
was
with
great
labour
rak
'd
together
and
thrown
up
into
carts
open
*NL*
above
,
the
sides
of
which
suffer
'd
some
of
the
slush
at
every
jolt
on
*NL*
the
pavement
to
shake
out
and
fall
,
sometimes
to
the
annoyance
of
*NL*
foot-passengers
.
The
reason
given
for
not
sweeping
the
dusty
streets
*NL*
was
,
that
the
dust
would
fly
into
the
windows
of
shops
and
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
accidental
occurrence
had
instructed
me
how
much
sweeping
might
be
*NL*
done
in
a
little
time
.
I
found
at
my
door
in
Craven-street
,
one
*NL*
morning
,
a
poor
woman
sweeping
my
pavement
with
a
birch
broom
;
she
*NL*
appeared
very
pale
and
feeble
,
as
just
come
out
of
a
fit
of
sickness
.
*NL*
I
ask
'd
who
employ
'd
her
to
sweep
there
;
she
said
,
``
Nobody
,
but
I
am
*NL*
very
poor
and
in
distress
,
and
I
sweeps
before
gentlefolkses
doors
,
and
*NL*
hopes
they
will
give
me
something
.
''
I
bid
her
sweep
the
whole
street
*NL*
clean
,
and
I
would
give
her
a
shilling
;
this
was
at
nine
o'clock
;
at
12
*NL*
she
came
for
the
shilling
.
From
the
slowness
I
saw
at
first
in
her
*NL*
working
,
I
could
scarce
believe
that
the
work
was
done
so
soon
,
and
*NL*
sent
my
servant
to
examine
it
,
who
reported
that
the
whole
street
was
*NL*
swept
perfectly
clean
,
and
all
the
dust
plac
'd
in
the
gutter
,
which
was
*NL*
in
the
middle
;
and
the
next
rain
wash
'd
it
quite
away
,
so
that
the
*NL*
pavement
and
even
the
kennel
were
perfectly
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
judg
'd
that
,
if
that
feeble
woman
could
sweep
such
a
street
in
*NL*
three
hours
,
a
strong
,
active
man
might
have
done
it
in
half
the
time
.
*NL*
And
here
let
me
remark
the
convenience
of
having
but
one
gutter
in
such
*NL*
a
narrow
street
,
running
down
its
middle
,
instead
of
two
,
one
on
each
*NL*
side
,
near
the
footway
;
for
where
all
the
rain
that
falls
on
a
street
*NL*
runs
from
the
sides
and
meets
in
the
middle
,
it
forms
there
a
current
*NL*
strong
enough
to
wash
away
all
the
mud
it
meets
with
;
but
when
divided
*NL*
into
two
channels
,
it
is
often
too
weak
to
cleanse
either
,
and
only
*NL*
makes
the
mud
it
finds
more
fluid
,
so
that
the
wheels
of
carriages
and
*NL*
feet
of
horses
throw
and
dash
it
upon
the
foot-pavement
,
which
is
*NL*
thereby
rendered
foul
and
slippery
,
and
sometimes
splash
it
upon
those
*NL*
who
are
walking
.
My
proposal
,
communicated
to
the
good
doctor
,
was
as
*NL*
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
more
effectual
cleaning
and
keeping
clean
the
streets
of
*NL*
London
and
Westminster
,
it
is
proposed
that
the
several
watchmen
be
*NL*
contracted
with
to
have
the
dust
swept
up
in
dry
seasons
,
and
the
mud
*NL*
rak
'd
up
at
other
times
,
each
in
the
several
streets
and
lanes
of
his
*NL*
round
;
that
they
be
furnish
'd
with
brooms
and
other
proper
instruments
*NL*
for
these
purposes
,
to
be
kept
at
their
respective
stands
,
ready
to
*NL*
furnish
the
poor
people
they
may
employ
in
the
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
in
the
dry
summer
months
the
dust
be
all
swept
up
into
heaps
at
*NL*
proper
distances
,
before
the
shops
and
windows
of
houses
are
usually
*NL*
opened
,
when
the
scavengers
,
with
close-covered
carts
,
shall
also
carry
*NL*
it
all
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
the
mud
,
when
rak
'd
up
,
be
not
left
in
heaps
to
be
spread
abroad
*NL*
again
by
the
wheels
of
carriages
and
trampling
of
horses
,
but
that
the
*NL*
scavengers
be
provided
with
bodies
of
carts
,
not
plac
'd
high
upon
*NL*
wheels
,
but
low
upon
sliders
,
with
lattice
bottoms
,
which
,
being
*NL*
cover
'd
with
straw
,
will
retain
the
mud
thrown
into
them
,
and
permit
*NL*
the
water
to
drain
from
it
,
whereby
it
will
become
much
lighter
,
water
*NL*
making
the
greatest
part
of
its
weight
;
these
bodies
of
carts
to
be
*NL*
plac
'd
at
convenient
distances
,
and
the
mud
brought
to
them
in
*NL*
wheel-barrows
;
they
remaining
where
plac
'd
till
the
mud
is
drain
'd
,
and
*NL*
then
horses
brought
to
draw
them
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
since
had
doubts
of
the
practicability
of
the
latter
part
of
*NL*
this
proposal
,
on
account
of
the
narrowness
of
some
streets
,
and
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
placing
the
draining-sleds
so
as
not
to
encumber
too
much
*NL*
the
passage
;
but
I
am
still
of
opinion
that
the
former
,
requiring
the
*NL*
dust
to
be
swept
up
and
carry
'd
away
before
the
shops
are
open
,
is
very
*NL*
practicable
in
the
summer
,
when
the
days
are
long
;
for
,
in
walking
*NL*
thro
'
the
Strand
and
Fleet-street
one
morning
at
seven
o'clock
,
I
*NL*
observ
'd
there
was
not
one
shop
open
,
tho
'
it
had
been
daylight
and
the
*NL*
sun
up
above
three
hours
;
the
inhabitants
of
London
chusing
voluntarily
*NL*
to
live
much
by
candle-light
,
and
sleep
by
sunshine
,
and
yet
often
*NL*
complain
,
a
little
absurdly
,
of
the
duty
on
candles
and
the
high
price
*NL*
of
tallow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
may
think
these
trifling
matters
not
worth
minding
or
relating
;
*NL*
but
when
they
consider
that
tho
'
dust
blown
into
the
eyes
of
a
single
*NL*
person
,
or
into
a
single
shop
on
a
windy
day
,
is
but
of
small
*NL*
importance
,
yet
the
great
number
of
the
instances
in
a
populous
city
,
*NL*
and
its
frequent
repetitions
give
it
weight
and
consequence
,
perhaps
*NL*
they
will
not
censure
very
severely
those
who
bestow
some
attention
to
*NL*
affairs
of
this
seemingly
low
nature
.
Human
felicity
is
produc
'd
not
*NL*
so
much
by
great
pieces
of
good
fortune
that
seldom
happen
,
as
by
*NL*
little
advantages
that
occur
every
day
.
Thus
,
if
you
teach
a
poor
*NL*
young
man
to
shave
himself
,
and
keep
his
razor
in
order
,
you
may
*NL*
contribute
more
to
the
happiness
of
his
life
than
in
giving
him
a
*NL*
thousand
guineas
.
The
money
may
be
soon
spent
,
the
regret
only
*NL*
remaining
of
having
foolishly
consumed
it
;
but
in
the
other
case
,
he
*NL*
escapes
the
frequent
vexation
of
waiting
for
barbers
,
and
of
their
*NL*
sometimes
dirty
fingers
,
offensive
breaths
,
and
dull
razors
;
he
shaves
*NL*
when
most
convenient
to
him
,
and
enjoys
daily
the
pleasure
of
its
being
*NL*
done
with
a
good
instrument
.
With
these
sentiments
I
have
hazarded
the
*NL*
few
preceding
pages
,
hoping
they
may
afford
hints
which
some
time
or
*NL*
other
may
be
useful
to
a
city
I
love
,
having
lived
many
years
in
it
*NL*
very
happily
,
and
perhaps
to
some
of
our
towns
in
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
been
for
some
time
employed
by
the
postmaster-general
of
America
*NL*
as
his
comptroller
in
regulating
several
offices
,
and
bringing
the
*NL*
officers
to
account
,
I
was
,
upon
his
death
in
1753
,
appointed
,
jointly
*NL*
with
Mr.
William
Hunter
,
to
succeed
him
,
by
a
commission
from
the
*NL*
postmaster-general
in
England
.
The
American
office
never
had
hitherto
*NL*
paid
any
thing
to
that
of
Britain
.
We
were
to
have
six
hundred
pounds
*NL*
a
year
between
us
,
if
we
could
make
that
sum
out
of
the
profits
of
the
*NL*
office
.
To
do
this
,
a
variety
of
improvements
were
necessary
;
some
of
*NL*
these
were
inevitably
at
first
expensive
,
so
that
in
the
first
four
*NL*
years
the
office
became
above
nine
hundred
pounds
in
debt
to
us
.
But
*NL*
it
soon
after
began
to
repay
us
;
and
before
I
was
displac
'd
by
a
freak
*NL*
of
the
ministers
,
of
which
I
shall
speak
hereafter
,
we
had
brought
it
*NL*
to
yield
three
times
as
much
clear
revenue
to
the
crown
as
the
*NL*
postoffice
of
Ireland
.
Since
that
imprudent
transaction
,
they
have
*NL*
receiv
'd
from
it
--
not
one
farthing
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
business
of
the
postoffice
occasion
'd
my
taking
a
journey
this
year
*NL*
to
New
England
,
where
the
College
of
Cambridge
,
of
their
own
motion
,
*NL*
presented
me
with
the
degree
of
Master
of
Arts
.
Yale
College
,
in
*NL*
Connecticut
,
had
before
made
me
a
similar
compliment
.
Thus
,
without
*NL*
studying
in
any
college
,
I
came
to
partake
of
their
honours
.
They
were
*NL*
conferr
'd
in
consideration
of
my
improvements
and
discoveries
in
the
*NL*
electric
branch
of
natural
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1754
,
war
with
France
being
again
apprehended
,
a
congress
of
*NL*
commissioners
from
the
different
colonies
was
,
by
an
order
of
the
Lords
*NL*
of
Trade
,
to
be
assembled
at
Albany
,
there
to
confer
with
the
chiefs
of
*NL*
the
Six
Nations
concerning
the
means
of
defending
both
their
country
*NL*
and
ours
.
Governor
Hamilton
,
having
receiv
'd
this
order
,
acquainted
*NL*
the
House
with
it
,
requesting
they
would
furnish
proper
presents
for
*NL*
the
Indians
,
to
be
given
on
this
occasion
;
and
naming
the
speaker
-LRB-
Mr.
*NL*
Norris
-RRB-
and
myself
to
join
Mr.
Thomas
Penn
and
Mr.
Secretary
Peters
as
*NL*
commissioners
to
act
for
Pennsylvania
.
The
House
approv
'd
the
*NL*
nomination
,
and
provided
the
goods
for
the
present
,
and
tho
'
they
did
*NL*
not
much
like
treating
out
of
the
provinces
;
and
we
met
the
other
*NL*
commissioners
at
Albany
about
the
middle
of
June
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
our
way
thither
,
I
projected
and
drew
a
plan
for
the
union
of
all
*NL*
the
colonies
under
one
government
,
so
far
as
might
be
necessary
for
*NL*
defense
,
and
other
important
general
purposes
.
As
we
pass
'd
thro
'
New
*NL*
York
,
I
had
there
shown
my
project
to
Mr.
James
Alexander
and
Mr.
*NL*
Kennedy
,
two
gentlemen
of
great
knowledge
in
public
affairs
,
and
,
being
*NL*
fortified
by
their
approbation
,
I
ventur
'd
to
lay
it
before
the
*NL*
Congress
.
It
then
appeared
that
several
of
the
commissioners
had
*NL*
form
'd
plans
of
the
same
kind
.
A
previous
question
was
first
taken
,
*NL*
whether
a
union
should
be
established
,
which
pass
'd
in
the
affirmative
*NL*
unanimously
.
A
committee
was
then
appointed
,
one
member
from
each
*NL*
colony
,
to
consider
the
several
plans
and
report
.
Mine
happen
'd
to
be
*NL*
preferr
'd
,
and
,
with
a
few
amendments
,
was
accordingly
reported
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
plan
the
general
government
was
to
be
administered
by
a
*NL*
president-general
,
appointed
and
supported
by
the
crown
,
and
a
grand
*NL*
council
was
to
be
chosen
by
the
representatives
of
the
people
of
the
*NL*
several
colonies
,
met
in
their
respective
assemblies
.
The
debates
upon
*NL*
it
in
Congress
went
on
daily
,
hand
in
hand
with
the
Indian
business
.
*NL*
Many
objections
and
difficulties
were
started
,
but
at
length
they
were
*NL*
all
overcome
,
and
the
plan
was
unanimously
agreed
to
,
and
copies
*NL*
ordered
to
be
transmitted
to
the
Board
of
Trade
and
to
the
assemblies
*NL*
of
the
several
provinces
.
Its
fate
was
singular
:
the
assemblies
did
*NL*
not
adopt
it
,
as
they
all
thought
there
was
too
much
prerogative
in
it
,
*NL*
and
in
England
it
was
judg
'd
to
have
too
much
of
the
democratic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Board
of
Trade
therefore
did
not
approve
of
it
,
nor
recommend
it
*NL*
for
the
approbation
of
his
majesty
;
but
another
scheme
was
form
'd
,
*NL*
supposed
to
answer
the
same
purpose
better
,
whereby
the
governors
of
*NL*
the
provinces
,
with
some
members
of
their
respective
councils
,
were
to
*NL*
meet
and
order
the
raising
of
troops
,
building
of
forts
,
etc.
,
and
to
*NL*
draw
on
the
treasury
of
Great
Britain
for
the
expense
,
which
was
*NL*
afterwards
to
be
refunded
by
an
act
of
Parliament
laying
a
tax
on
*NL*
America
.
My
plan
,
with
my
reasons
in
support
of
it
,
is
to
be
found
*NL*
among
my
political
papers
that
are
printed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
the
winter
following
in
Boston
,
I
had
much
conversation
with
*NL*
Governor
Shirley
upon
both
the
plans
.
Part
of
what
passed
between
us
*NL*
on
the
occasion
may
also
be
seen
among
those
papers
.
The
different
and
*NL*
contrary
reasons
of
dislike
to
my
plan
makes
me
suspect
that
it
was
*NL*
really
the
true
medium
;
and
I
am
still
of
opinion
it
would
have
been
*NL*
happy
for
both
sides
the
water
if
it
had
been
adopted
.
The
colonies
,
*NL*
so
united
,
would
have
been
sufficiently
strong
to
have
defended
*NL*
themselves
;
there
would
then
have
been
no
need
of
troops
from
England
;
*NL*
of
course
,
the
subsequent
pretence
for
taxing
America
,
and
the
bloody
*NL*
contest
it
occasioned
,
would
have
been
avoided
.
But
such
mistakes
are
*NL*
not
new
;
history
is
full
of
the
errors
of
states
and
princes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Look
round
the
habitable
world
,
how
few
*NL*
Know
their
own
good
,
or
,
knowing
it
,
pursue
!
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
govern
,
having
much
business
on
their
hands
,
do
not
generally
*NL*
like
to
take
the
trouble
of
considering
and
carrying
into
execution
new
*NL*
projects
.
The
best
public
measures
are
therefore
seldom
adopted
from
*NL*
previous
wisdom
,
but
forc
'd
by
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Governor
of
Pennsylvania
,
in
sending
it
down
to
the
Assembly
,
*NL*
express
'd
his
approbation
of
the
plan
,
``
as
appearing
to
him
to
be
drawn
*NL*
up
with
great
clearness
and
strength
of
judgment
,
and
therefore
*NL*
recommended
it
as
well
worthy
of
their
closest
and
most
serious
*NL*
attention
.
''
The
House
,
however
,
by
the
management
of
a
certain
member
,
*NL*
took
it
up
when
I
happen
'd
to
be
absent
,
which
I
thought
not
very
fair
,
*NL*
and
reprobated
it
without
paying
any
attention
to
it
at
all
,
to
my
no
*NL*
small
mortification
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
journey
to
Boston
this
year
,
I
met
at
New
York
with
our
new
*NL*
governor
,
Mr.
Morris
,
just
arriv
'd
there
from
England
,
with
whom
I
had
*NL*
been
before
intimately
acquainted
.
He
brought
a
commission
to
*NL*
supersede
Mr.
Hamilton
,
who
,
tir
'd
with
the
disputes
his
proprietary
*NL*
instructions
subjected
him
to
,
had
resign
'd
.
Mr.
Morris
ask
'd
me
if
I
*NL*
thought
he
must
expect
as
uncomfortable
an
administration
.
I
said
,
*NL*
``
No
;
you
may
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
a
very
comfortable
one
,
if
you
will
*NL*
only
take
care
not
to
enter
into
any
dispute
with
the
Assembly
.
''
``
My
*NL*
dear
friend
,
''
says
he
,
pleasantly
,
``
how
can
you
advise
my
avoiding
*NL*
disputes
?
You
know
I
love
disputing
;
it
is
one
of
my
greatest
*NL*
pleasures
;
however
,
to
show
the
regard
I
have
for
your
counsel
,
I
*NL*
promise
you
I
will
,
if
possible
,
avoid
them
.
''
He
had
some
reason
for
*NL*
loving
to
dispute
,
being
eloquent
,
an
acute
sophister
,
and
,
therefore
,
*NL*
generally
successful
in
argumentative
conversation
.
He
had
been
*NL*
brought
up
to
it
from
a
boy
,
his
father
,
as
I
have
heard
,
accustoming
*NL*
his
children
to
dispute
with
one
another
for
his
diversion
,
while
*NL*
sitting
at
table
after
dinner
;
but
I
think
the
practice
was
not
wise
;
*NL*
for
,
in
the
course
of
my
observation
,
these
disputing
,
contradicting
,
*NL*
and
confuting
people
are
generally
unfortunate
in
their
affairs
.
They
*NL*
get
victory
sometimes
,
but
they
never
get
good
will
,
which
would
be
of
*NL*
more
use
to
them
.
We
parted
,
he
going
to
Philadelphia
,
and
I
to
Boston
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
returning
,
I
met
at
New
York
with
the
votes
of
the
Assembly
,
by
*NL*
which
it
appear
'd
that
,
notwithstanding
his
promise
to
me
,
he
and
the
*NL*
House
were
already
in
high
contention
;
and
it
was
a
continual
battle
*NL*
between
them
as
long
as
he
retain
'd
the
government
.
I
had
my
share
of
*NL*
it
;
for
,
as
soon
as
I
got
back
to
my
seat
in
the
Assembly
,
I
was
put
on
*NL*
every
committee
for
answering
his
speeches
and
messages
,
and
by
the
*NL*
committees
always
desired
to
make
the
drafts
.
Our
answers
,
as
well
as
*NL*
his
messages
,
were
often
tart
,
and
sometimes
indecently
abusive
;
and
,
*NL*
as
he
knew
I
wrote
for
the
Assembly
,
one
might
have
imagined
that
,
when
*NL*
we
met
,
we
could
hardly
avoid
cutting
throats
;
but
he
was
so
*NL*
good-natur
'd
a
man
that
no
personal
difference
between
him
and
me
was
*NL*
occasion
'd
by
the
contest
,
and
we
often
din
'd
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
in
the
height
of
this
public
quarrel
,
we
met
in
the
*NL*
street
.
``
Franklin
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
must
go
home
with
me
and
spend
the
*NL*
evening
;
I
am
to
have
some
company
that
you
will
like
;
''
and
,
taking
me
*NL*
by
the
arm
,
he
led
me
to
his
house
.
In
gay
conversation
over
our
wine
,
*NL*
after
supper
,
he
told
us
,
jokingly
,
that
he
much
admir
'd
the
idea
of
*NL*
Sancho
Panza
,
who
,
when
it
was
proposed
to
give
him
a
government
,
*NL*
requested
it
might
be
a
government
of
blacks
,
as
then
,
if
he
could
not
*NL*
agree
with
his
people
,
he
might
sell
them
.
One
of
his
friends
,
who
sat
*NL*
next
to
me
,
says
,
``
Franklin
,
why
do
you
continue
to
side
with
these
*NL*
damn
'd
Quakers
?
Had
not
you
better
sell
them
?
The
proprietor
would
*NL*
give
you
a
good
price
.
''
``
The
governor
,
''
says
I
,
``
has
not
yet
blacked
*NL*
them
enough
.
''
He
,
indeed
,
had
labored
hard
to
blacken
the
Assembly
in
*NL*
all
his
messages
,
but
they
wip
'd
off
his
coloring
as
fast
as
he
laid
it
*NL*
on
,
and
plac
'd
it
,
in
return
,
thick
upon
his
own
face
;
so
that
,
finding
*NL*
he
was
likely
to
be
negrofied
himself
,
he
,
as
well
as
Mr.
Hamilton
,
*NL*
grew
tir
'd
of
the
contest
,
and
quitted
the
government
.

These
public
quarrels
were
all
at
bottom
owing
to
the
*NL*
proprietaries
,
our
hereditary
governors
,
who
,
when
any
expense
was
to
*NL*
be
incurred
for
the
defense
of
their
province
,
with
incredible
meanness
*NL*
instructed
their
deputies
to
pass
no
act
for
levying
the
necessary
*NL*
taxes
,
unless
their
vast
estates
were
in
the
same
act
expressly
*NL*
excused
;
and
they
had
even
taken
bonds
of
these
deputies
to
observe
*NL*
such
instructions
.
The
Assemblies
for
three
years
held
out
against
*NL*
this
injustice
,
tho
'
constrained
to
bend
at
last
.
At
length
Captain
*NL*
Denny
,
who
was
Governor
Morris
's
successor
,
ventured
to
disobey
those
*NL*
instructions
;
how
that
was
brought
about
I
shall
show
hereafter

But
I
am
got
forward
too
fast
with
my
story
:
there
are
still
some
*NL*
transactions
to
be
mention
'd
that
happened
during
the
administration
of
*NL*
Governor
Morris
.
*NL*
*NL*
War
being
in
a
manner
commenced
with
France
,
the
government
of
*NL*
Massachusetts
Bay
projected
an
attack
upon
Crown
Point
,
and
sent
Mr.
*NL*
Quincy
to
Pennsylvania
,
and
Mr.
Pownall
,
afterward
Governor
Pownall
,
to
*NL*
New
York
,
to
solicit
assistance
.
As
I
was
in
the
Assembly
,
knew
its
*NL*
temper
,
and
was
Mr.
Quincy
's
countryman
,
he
appli
'd
to
me
for
my
*NL*
influence
and
assistance
.
I
dictated
his
address
to
them
,
which
was
*NL*
well
receiv
'd
.
They
voted
an
aid
of
ten
thousand
pounds
,
to
be
laid
out
*NL*
in
provisions
.
But
the
governor
refusing
his
assent
to
their
bill
*NL*
-LRB-
which
included
this
with
other
sums
granted
for
the
use
of
the
crown
-RRB-
,
*NL*
unless
a
clause
were
inserted
exempting
the
proprietary
estate
from
*NL*
bearing
any
part
of
the
tax
that
would
be
necessary
,
the
Assembly
,
tho
'
*NL*
very
desirous
of
making
their
grant
to
New
England
effectual
,
were
at
a
*NL*
loss
how
to
accomplish
it
.
Mr.
Quincy
labored
hard
with
the
governor
*NL*
to
obtain
his
assent
,
but
he
was
obstinate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
suggested
a
method
of
doing
the
business
without
the
governor
,
*NL*
by
orders
on
the
trustees
of
the
Loan
Office
,
which
,
by
law
,
the
*NL*
Assembly
had
the
right
of
drawing
.
There
was
,
indeed
,
little
or
no
*NL*
money
at
that
time
in
the
office
,
and
therefore
I
propos
'd
that
the
*NL*
orders
should
be
payable
in
a
year
,
and
to
bear
an
interest
of
five
per
*NL*
cent
.
With
these
orders
I
suppos
'd
the
provisions
might
easily
be
*NL*
purchas
'd
.
The
Assembly
,
with
very
little
hesitation
,
adopted
the
*NL*
proposal
.
The
orders
were
immediately
printed
,
and
I
was
one
of
the
*NL*
committee
directed
to
sign
and
dispose
of
them
.
The
fund
for
paying
*NL*
them
was
the
interest
of
all
the
paper
currency
then
extant
in
the
*NL*
province
upon
loan
,
together
with
the
revenue
arising
from
the
excise
,
*NL*
which
being
known
to
be
more
than
sufficient
,
they
obtain
'd
instant
*NL*
credit
,
and
were
not
only
receiv
'd
in
payment
for
the
provisions
,
but
*NL*
many
money
'd
people
,
who
had
cash
lying
by
them
,
vested
it
in
those
*NL*
orders
,
which
they
found
advantageous
,
as
they
bore
interest
while
upon
*NL*
hand
,
and
might
on
any
occasion
be
used
as
money
;
so
that
they
were
*NL*
eagerly
all
bought
up
,
and
in
a
few
weeks
none
of
them
were
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
Thus
this
important
affair
was
by
my
means
compleated
.
My
Quincy
*NL*
return
'd
thanks
to
the
Assembly
in
a
handsome
memorial
,
went
home
*NL*
highly
pleas
'd
with
the
success
of
his
embassy
,
and
ever
after
bore
for
*NL*
me
the
most
cordial
and
affectionate
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
British
government
,
not
chusing
to
permit
the
union
of
the
colonies
*NL*
as
propos
'd
at
Albany
,
and
to
trust
that
union
with
their
defense
,
lest
*NL*
they
should
thereby
grow
too
military
,
and
feel
their
own
strength
,
*NL*
suspicions
and
jealousies
at
this
time
being
entertain
'd
of
them
,
sent
*NL*
over
General
Braddock
with
two
regiments
of
regular
English
troops
for
*NL*
that
purpose
.
He
landed
at
Alexandria
,
in
Virginia
,
and
thence
march
'd
*NL*
to
Frederictown
,
in
Maryland
,
where
he
halted
for
carriages
.
Our
*NL*
Assembly
apprehending
,
from
some
information
,
that
he
had
conceived
*NL*
violent
prejudices
against
them
,
as
averse
to
the
service
,
wish
'd
me
to
*NL*
wait
upon
him
,
not
as
from
them
,
but
as
postmaster-general
,
under
the
*NL*
guise
of
proposing
to
settle
with
him
the
mode
of
conducting
with
most
*NL*
celerity
and
certainty
the
despatches
between
him
and
the
governors
of
*NL*
the
several
provinces
,
with
whom
he
must
necessarily
have
continual
*NL*
correspondence
,
and
of
which
they
propos
'd
to
pay
the
expense
.
My
son
*NL*
accompanied
me
on
this
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
the
general
at
Frederictown
,
waiting
impatiently
for
the
*NL*
return
of
those
he
had
sent
thro
'
the
back
parts
of
Maryland
and
*NL*
Virginia
to
collect
waggons
.
I
stayed
with
him
several
days
,
din
'd
*NL*
with
him
daily
,
and
had
full
opportunity
of
removing
all
his
*NL*
prejudices
,
by
the
information
of
what
the
Assembly
had
before
his
*NL*
arrival
actually
done
,
and
were
still
willing
to
do
,
to
facilitate
his
*NL*
operations
.
When
I
was
about
to
depart
,
the
returns
of
waggons
to
be
*NL*
obtained
were
brought
in
,
by
which
it
appear
'd
that
they
amounted
only
*NL*
to
twenty-five
,
and
not
all
of
those
were
in
serviceable
condition
.
*NL*
The
general
and
all
the
officers
were
surpris
'd
,
declar
'd
the
*NL*
expedition
was
then
at
an
end
,
being
impossible
,
and
exclaim
'd
against
*NL*
the
ministers
for
ignorantly
landing
them
in
a
country
destitute
of
the
*NL*
means
of
conveying
their
stores
,
baggage
,
etc.
,
not
less
than
one
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
waggons
being
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
happened
to
say
I
thought
it
was
a
pity
they
had
not
been
landed
*NL*
rather
in
Pennsylvania
,
as
in
that
country
almost
every
farmer
had
his
*NL*
waggon
.
The
general
eagerly
laid
hold
of
my
words
,
and
said
,
``
Then
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
who
are
a
man
of
interest
there
,
can
probably
procure
them
*NL*
for
us
;
and
I
beg
you
will
undertake
it
.
''
I
ask
'd
what
terms
were
to
*NL*
be
offer
'd
the
owners
of
the
waggons
;
and
I
was
desir
'd
to
put
on
paper
*NL*
the
terms
that
appeared
to
me
necessary
.
This
I
did
,
and
they
were
*NL*
agreed
to
,
and
a
commission
and
instructions
accordingly
prepar
'd
*NL*
immediately

What
those
terms
were
will
appear
in

I

being

from
the
*NL*
great

sudden

Being
occasionally
at
the
camp
at
Frederic
a
few
days
since
,
I
found
*NL*
the
general
and
officers
extremely
exasperated
on
account
of
their
not
*NL*
being
supplied
with
horses
and
carriages
,
which
had
been
expected
from
*NL*
this
province
,
as
most
able
to
furnish
them
;
but
,
through
the
*NL*
dissensions
between
our
governor
and
Assembly
,
money
had
not
been
*NL*
provided
,
nor
any
steps
taken
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
proposed
to
send
an
armed
force
immediately
into
these
*NL*
counties
,
to
seize
as
many
of
the
best
carriages
and
horses
as
should
*NL*
be
wanted
,
and
compel
as
many
persons
into
the
service
as
would
be
*NL*
necessary
to
drive
and
take
care
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
apprehended
that
the
progress
of
British
soldiers
through
these
*NL*
counties
on
such
an
occasion
,
especially
considering
the
temper
they
*NL*
are
in
,
and
their
resentment
against
us
,
would
be
attended
with
many
*NL*
and
great
inconveniences
to
the
inhabitants
,
and
therefore
more
*NL*
willingly
took
the
trouble
of
trying
first
what
might
be
done
by
fair
*NL*
and
equitable
means
.
The
people
of
these
back
counties
have
lately
*NL*
complained
to
the
Assembly
that
a
sufficient
currency
was
wanting
;
you
*NL*
have
an
opportunity
of
receiving
and
dividing
among
you
a
very
*NL*
considerable
sum
;
for
,
if
the
service
of
this
expedition
should
*NL*
continue
,
as
it
is
more
than
probable
it
will
,
for
one
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty
days
,
the
hire
of
these
waggons
and
horses
will
amount
to
upward
*NL*
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
,
which
will
be
paid
you
in
silver
and
gold
of
*NL*
the
king
's
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
service
will
be
light
and
easy
,
for
the
army
will
scarce
march
*NL*
above
twelve
miles
per
day
,
and
the
waggons
and
baggage-horses
,
as
they
*NL*
carry
those
things
that
are
absolutely
necessary
to
the
welfare
of
the
*NL*

march
with

no

are

for
the
army

*NL*
sake

always
placed
where
they
can
be
most
secure

you
may
now
do
a
most
acceptable

make
it
easy

to
yourselves

for
three
or
four
of
such
as
can
not

a

it
together

one
furnishing

two
horses

divide
the
pay
proportionately

between
you

not
this

your
king

country
*NL*
voluntarily

when
such
good

reasonable
terms

offered
to

your
loyalty

be
strongly
suspected

business
must

be
done

so
many
brave

not

your
backwardness

do
what
may

expected
from
you
;
waggons

horses
must
be
had

violent
measures

will
probably
be
used
,
and
you
will
be
left
to
seek
for
a
recompense
*NL*
where
you
can

perhaps

only

If
this

likely

I
am

*NL*
*NL*
I
received
of
the
general
about
eight
hundred
pounds
,
to
be
disbursed
*NL*
in
advance-money
to
the
waggon
owners
,
etc.
;
but
,
that
sum
being
*NL*
insufficient
,
I
advanc
'd
upward
of
two
hundred
pounds
more
,
and
in
two
*NL*
weeks
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
waggons
,
with
two
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty-nine
carrying
horses
,
were
on
their
march
for
the
camp
.
The
*NL*
advertisement
promised
payment
according
to
the
valuation
,
in
case
any
*NL*
waggon
or
horse
should
be
lost
.
The
owners
,
however
,
alleging
they
did
*NL*
not
know
General
Braddock
,
or
what
dependence
might
be
had
on
his
*NL*
promise
,
insisted
on
my
bond
for
the
performance
,
which
I
accordingly
*NL*
gave
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
at
the
camp
,
supping
one
evening
with
the
officers
of
*NL*
Colonel
Dunbar
's
regiment
,
he
represented
to
me
his
concern
for
the
*NL*
subalterns
,
who
,
he
said
,
were
generally
not
in
affluence
,
and
could
*NL*
ill
afford
,
in
this
dear
country
,
to
lay
in
the
stores
that
might
be
*NL*
necessary
in
so
long
a
march
,
thro
'
a
wilderness
,
where
nothing
was
to
*NL*
be
purchas
'd
.
I
commiserated
their
case
,
and
resolved
to
endeavor
*NL*
procuring
them
some
relief
.
I
said
nothing
,
however
,
to
him
of
my
*NL*
intention
,
but
wrote
the
next
morning
to
the
committee
of
the
Assembly
,
*NL*
who
had
the
disposition
of
some
public
money
,
warmly
recommending
the
*NL*
case
of
these
officers
to
their
consideration
,
and
proposing
that
a
*NL*
present
should
be
sent
them
of
necessaries
and
refreshments
.
My
son
,
*NL*
who
had
some
experience
of
a
camp
life
,
and
of
its
wants
,
drew
up
a
*NL*
list
for
me
,
which
I
enclos
'd
in
my
letter
.
The
committee
approv
'd
,
*NL*
and
used
such
diligence
that
,
conducted
by
my
son
,
the
stores
arrived
*NL*
at
the
camp
as
soon
as
the
waggons
.
They
consisted
of
twenty
parcels
,
*NL*
each
containing
*NL*
*NL*
6
lbs
.
loaf
sugar
.
1
Gloucester

*NL*
*NL*
These
twenty
parcels
,
well
pack
'd
,
were
placed
on
as
many
horses
,
each
*NL*
parcel
,
with
the
horse
,
being
intended
as
a
present
for
one
officer
.
*NL*
They
were
very
thankfully
receiv
'd
,
and
the
kindness
acknowledg
'd
by
*NL*
letters
to
me
from
the
colonels
of
both
regiments
,
in
the
most
grateful
*NL*
terms
.
The
general
,
too
,
was
highly
satisfied
with
my
conduct
in
*NL*
procuring
him
the
waggons
,
etc.
,
and
readily
paid
my
account
of
*NL*
disbursements
,
thanking
me
repeatedly
,
and
requesting
my
farther
*NL*
assistance
in
sending
provisions
after
him
.
I
undertook
this
also
,
and
*NL*
was
busily
employ
'd
in
it
till
we
heard
of
his
defeat
,
advancing
for
*NL*
the
service
of
my
own
money
,
upwards
of
one
thousand
pounds
sterling
,
*NL*
of
which
I
sent
him
an
account
.
It
came
to
his
hands
,
luckily
for
me
,
*NL*
a
few
days
before
the
battle
,
and
he
return
'd
me
immediately
an
order
*NL*
on
the
paymaster
for
the
round
sum
of
one
thousand
pounds
,
leaving
the
*NL*
remainder
to
the
next
account
.
I
consider
this
payment
as
good
luck
,
*NL*
having
never
been
able
to
obtain
that
remainder
,
of
which
more
*NL*
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
general
was
,
I
think
,
a
brave
man
,
and
might
probably
have
made
a
*NL*
figure
as
a
good
officer
in
some
European
war
.
But
he
had
too
much
*NL*
self-confidence
,
too
high
an
opinion
of
the
validity
of
regular
troops
,
*NL*
and
too
mean
a
one
of
both
Americans
and
Indians
.
George
Croghan
,
our
*NL*
Indian
interpreter
,
join
'd
him
on
his
march
with
one
hundred
of
those
*NL*
people
,
who
might
have
been
of
great
use
to
his
army
as
guides
,
scouts
,
*NL*
etc.
,
if
he
had
treated
them
kindly
;
but
he
slighted
and
neglected
*NL*
them
,
and
they
gradually
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
conversation
with
him
one
day
,
he
was
giving
me
some
account
of
his
*NL*
intended
progress
.
``
After
taking
Fort
Duquesne
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
am
to
*NL*
proceed
to
Niagara
;
and
,
having
taken
that
,
to
Frontenac
,
if
the
season
*NL*
will
allow
time
;
and
I
suppose
it
will
,
for
Duquesne
can
hardly
detain
*NL*
me
above
three
or
four
days
;
and
then
I
see
nothing
that
can
obstruct
*NL*
my
march
to
Niagara
.
''
Having
before
revolv
'd
in
my
mind
the
long
line
*NL*
his
army
must
make
in
their
march
by
a
very
narrow
road
,
to
be
cut
for
*NL*
them
thro
'
the
woods
and
bushes
,
and
also
what
I
had
read
of
a
former
*NL*
defeat
of
fifteen
hundred
French
,
who
invaded
the
Iroquois
country
,
I
*NL*
had
conceiv
'd
some
doubts
and
some
fears
for
the
event
of
the
campaign
.
*NL*
But
I
ventur
'd
only
to
say
,
``
To
be
sure
,
sir
,
if
you
arrive
well
before
*NL*
Duquesne
,
with
these
fine
troops
,
so
well
provided
with
artillery
,
that
*NL*
place
not
yet
compleatly
fortified
,
and
as
we
hear
with
no
very
strong
*NL*
garrison
,
can
probably
make
but
a
short
resistance
.
The
only
danger
I
*NL*
apprehend
of
obstruction
to
your
march
is
from
ambuscades
of
Indians
,
*NL*
who
,
by
constant
practice
,
are
dexterous
in
laying
and
executing
them
;
*NL*
and
the
slender
line
,
near
four
miles
long
,
which
your
army
must
make
,
*NL*
may
expose
it
to
be
attack
'd
by
surprise
in
its
flanks
,
and
to
be
cut
*NL*
like
a
thread
into
several
pieces
,
which
,
from
their
distance
,
can
not
*NL*
come
up
in
time
to
support
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smil
'd
at
my
ignorance
,
and
reply
'd
,
``
These
savages
may
,
indeed
,
be
*NL*
a
formidable
enemy
to
your
raw
American
militia
,
but
upon
the
king
's
*NL*
regular
and
disciplin
'd
troops
,
sir
,
it
is
impossible
they
should
make
*NL*
any
impression
.
''
I
was
conscious
of
an
impropriety
in
my
disputing
*NL*
with
a
military
man
in
matters
of
his
profession
,
and
said
no
more
.
*NL*
The
enemy
,
however
,
did
not
take
the
advantage
of
his
army
which
I
*NL*
apprehended
its
long
line
of
march
expos
'd
it
to
,
but
let
it
advance
*NL*
without
interruption
till
within
nine
miles
of
the
place
;
and
then
,
*NL*
when
more
in
a
body
-LRB-
for
it
had
just
passed
a
river
,
where
the
front
*NL*
had
halted
till
all
were
come
over
-RRB-
,
and
in
a
more
open
part
of
the
*NL*
woods
than
any
it
had
pass
'd
,
attack
'd
its
advanced
guard
by
a
heavy
*NL*
fire
from
behind
trees
and
bushes
,
which
was
the
first
intelligence
the
*NL*
general
had
of
an
enemy
's
being
near
him
.
This
guard
being
disordered
,
*NL*
the
general
hurried
the
troops
up
to
their
assistance
,
which
was
done
*NL*
in
great
confusion
,
thro
'
waggons
,
baggage
,
and
cattle
;
and
presently
*NL*
the
fire
came
upon
their
flank
:
the
officers
,
being
on
horseback
,
were
*NL*
more
easily
distinguish
'd
,
pick
'd
out
as
marks
,
and
fell
very
fast
;
and
*NL*
the
soldiers
were
crowded
together
in
a
huddle
,
having
or
hearing
no
*NL*
orders
,
and
standing
to
be
shot
at
till
two-thirds
of
them
were
killed
;
*NL*
and
then
,
being
seiz
'd
with
a
panick
,
the
whole
fled
with
precipitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
waggoners
took
each
a
horse
out
of
his
team
and
scamper
'd
;
their
*NL*
example
was
immediately
followed
by
others
;
so
that
all
the
waggons
,
*NL*
provisions
,
artillery
,
and
stores
were
left
to
the
enemy
.
The
general
,
*NL*
being
wounded
,
was
brought
off
with
difficulty
;
his
secretary
,
Mr.
*NL*
Shirley
,
was
killed
by
his
side
;
and
out
of
eighty-six
officers

*NL*
sixty-three
were
killed
or
wounded
,
and
seven
hundred
and
fourteen
men
*NL*
killed
out
of
eleven
hundred

These
eleven
hundred
had
been
picked
men
*NL*
from
the
whole
army

the
rest
had
been
left
behind
with
Colonel

follow
with
the
heavier
part
of
the
stores
,
provisions
,
and
*NL*
baggage
.
The
flyers
,
not
being
pursu
'd
,
arriv
'd
at
Dunbar
's
camp
,
and
*NL*
the
panick
they
brought
with
them
instantly
seiz
'd
him
and
all
his
*NL*
people
;
and
,
tho
'
he
had
now
above
one
thousand
men
,
and
the
enemy
who
*NL*
had
beaten
Braddock
did
not
at
most
exceed
four
hundred
Indians
and
*NL*
French
together
,
instead
of
proceeding
,
and
endeavoring
to
recover
some
*NL*
of
the
lost
honour
,
he
ordered
all
the
stores
,
ammunition
,
etc.
,
to
be
*NL*
destroy
'd
,
that
he
might
have
more
horses
to
assist
his
flight
towards
*NL*
the
settlements
,
and
less
lumber
to
remove
.
He
was
there
met
with
*NL*
requests
from
the
governors
of
Virginia
,
Maryland
,
and
Pennsylvania
,
*NL*
that
he
would
post
his
troops
on
the
frontiers
,
so
as
to
afford
some
*NL*
protection
to
the
inhabitants
;
but
he
continu
'd
his
hasty
march
thro
'
*NL*
all
the
country
,
not
thinking
himself
safe
till
he
arriv
'd
at
*NL*
Philadelphia
,
where
the
inhabitants
could
protect
him
.
This
whole
*NL*
transaction
gave
us
Americans
the
first
suspicion
that
our
exalted
*NL*
ideas
of
the
prowess
of
British
regulars
had
not
been
well
founded
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
first
march
,
too
,
from
their
landing
till
they
got
beyond
the
*NL*
settlements
,
they
had
plundered
and
stripped
the
inhabitants
,
totally
*NL*
ruining
some
poor
families
,
besides
insulting
,
abusing
,
and
confining
*NL*
the
people
if
they
remonstrated
.
This
was
enough
to
put
us
out
of
*NL*
conceit
of
such
defenders
,
if
we
had
really
wanted
any
.
How
different
*NL*
was
the
conduct
of
our
French
friends
in
1781
,
who
,
during
a
march
*NL*
thro
'
the
most
inhabited
part
of
our
country
from
Rhode
Island
to
*NL*
Virginia
,
near
seven
hundred
miles
,
occasioned
not
the
smallest
*NL*
complaint
for
the
loss
of
a
pig
,
a
chicken
,
or
even
an
apple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Orme
,
who
was
one
of
the
general
's
aids-de-camp
,
and
,
being
*NL*
grievously
wounded
,
was
brought
off
with
him
,
and
continu
'd
with
him
to
*NL*
his
death
,
which
happen
'd
in
a
few
days
,
told
me
that
he
was
totally
*NL*
silent
all
the
first
day
,
and
at
night
only
said
,
``
Who
would
have
*NL*
thought
it
?
''
That
he
was
silent
again
the
following
day
,
saying
only
*NL*
at
last
,
``
We
shall
better
know
how
to
deal
with
them
another
time
;
''
and
*NL*
dy
'd
in
a
few
minutes
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
secretary
's
papers
,
with
all
the
general
's
orders
,
instructions
,
*NL*
and
correspondence
,
falling
into
the
enemy
's
hands
,
they
selected
and
*NL*
translated
into
French
a
number
of
the
articles
,
which
they
printed
,
to
*NL*
prove
the
hostile
intentions
of
the
British
court
before
the
*NL*
declaration
of
war
.
Among
these
I
saw
some
letters
of
the
general
to
*NL*
the
ministry
,
speaking
highly
of
the
great
service
I
had
rendered
the
*NL*
army
,
and
recommending
me
to
their
notice
.
David
Hume
,
too
,
who
was
*NL*
some
years
after
secretary
to
Lord
Hertford
,
when
minister
in
France
,
*NL*
and
afterward
to
General
Conway
,
when
secretary
of
state
,
told
me
he
*NL*
had
seen
among
the
papers
in
that
office
,
letters
from
Braddock
highly
*NL*
recommending
me
.
But
,
the
expedition
having
been
unfortunate
,
my
*NL*
service
,
it
seems
,
was
not
thought
of
much
value
,
for
those
*NL*
recommendations
were
never
of
any
use
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
rewards
from
himself
,
I
ask
'd
only
one
,
which
was
,
that
he
would
*NL*
give
orders
to
his
officers
not
to
enlist
any
more
of
our
bought
*NL*
servants
,
and
that
he
would
discharge
such
as
had
been
already
*NL*
enlisted
.
This
he
readily
granted
,
and
several
were
accordingly
*NL*
return
'd
to
their
masters
,
on
my
application
.
Dunbar
,
when
the
command
*NL*
devolv
'd
on
him
,
was
not
so
generous
.
He
being
at
Philadelphia
,
on
his
*NL*
retreat
,
or
rather
flight
,
I
apply
'd
to
him
for
the
discharge
of
the
*NL*
servants
of
three
poor
farmers
of
Lancaster
county
that
he
had
*NL*
enlisted
,
reminding
him
of
the
late
general
's
orders
on
that
head
.
He
*NL*
promised
me
that
,
if
the
masters
would
come
to
him
at
Trenton
,
where
he
*NL*
should
be
in
a
few
days
on
his
march
to
New
York
,
he
would
there
*NL*
deliver
their
men
to
them
.
They
accordingly
were
at
the
expense
and
*NL*
trouble
of
going
to
Trenton
,
and
there
he
refus
'd
to
perform
his
*NL*
promise
,
to
their
great
loss
and
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
loss
of
the
waggons
and
horses
was
generally
known
,
all
*NL*
the
owners
came
upon
me
for
the
valuation
which
I
had
given
bond
to
*NL*
pay
.
Their
demands
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
,
my
acquainting
*NL*
them
that
the
money
was
ready
in
the
paymaster
's
hands
,
but
that
orders
*NL*
for
paying
it
must
first
be
obtained
from
General
Shirley
,
and
my
*NL*
assuring
them
that
I
had
apply
'd
to
that
general
by
letter
;
but
,
he
*NL*
being
at
a
distance
,
an
answer
could
not
soon
be
receiv
'd
,
and
they
*NL*
must
have
patience
,
all
this
was
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
,
and
some
*NL*
began
to
sue
me
.
General
Shirley
at
length
relieved
me
from
this
*NL*
terrible
situation
by
appointing
commissioners
to
examine
the
claims
,
*NL*
and
ordering
payment
.
They
amounted
to
near
twenty
thousand
pound
,
*NL*
which
to
pay
would
have
ruined
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
had
the
news
of
this
defeat
,
the
two
Doctors
Bond
came
to
me
*NL*
with
a
subscription
paper
for
raising
money
to
defray
the
expense
of
a
*NL*
grand
firework
,
which
it
was
intended
to
exhibit
at
a
rejoicing
on
*NL*
receipt
of
the
news
of
our
taking
Fort
Duquesne
.
I
looked
grave
,
and
*NL*
said
it
would
,
I
thought
,
be
time
enough
to
prepare
for
the
rejoicing
*NL*
when
we
knew
we
should
have
occasion
to
rejoice
.
They
seem
'd
surpris
'd
*NL*
that
I
did
not
immediately
comply
with
their
proposal
.
``
Why
the
d
--
l
!
''
*NL*
says
one
of
them
,
``
you
surely
do
n't
suppose
that
the
fort
will
not
be
*NL*
taken
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
that
it
will
not
be
taken
,
but
I
know
that
the
*NL*
events
of
war
are
subject
to
great
uncertainty
.
''
I
gave
them
the
*NL*
reasons
of
my
doubting
;
the
subscription
was
dropt
,
and
the
projectors
*NL*
thereby
missed
the
mortification
they
would
have
undergone
if
the
*NL*
firework
had
been
prepared
.
Dr.
Bond
,
on
some
other
occasion
*NL*
afterward
,
said
that
he
did
not
like
Franklin
's
forebodings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Governor
Morris
,
who
had
continually
worried
the
Assembly
with
message
*NL*
after
message
before
the
defeat
of
Braddock
,
to
beat
them
into
the
*NL*
making
of
acts
to
raise
money
for
the
defense
of
the
province
,
without
*NL*
taxing
,
among
others
,
the
proprietary
estates
,
and
had
rejected
all
*NL*
their
bills
for
not
having
such
an
exempting
clause
,
now
redoubled
his
*NL*
attacks
with
more
hope
of
success
,
the
danger
and
necessity
being
*NL*
greater
.
The
Assembly
,
however
,
continu
'd
firm
,
believing
they
had
*NL*
justice
on
their
side
,
and
that
it
would
be
giving
up
an
essential
*NL*
right
if
they
suffered
the
governor
to
amend
their
money-bills
.
In
one
*NL*
of
the
last
,
indeed
,
which
was
for
granting
fifty
thousand
pounds
,
his
*NL*
propos
'd
amendment
was
only
of
a
single
word
.
The
bill
expressed
``
that
*NL*
all
estates
,
real
and
personal
,
were
to
be
taxed
,
those
of
the
*NL*
proprietaries
not
excepted
.
''
His
amendment
was
,
for
not
read
only
:
a
*NL*
small
,
but
very
material
alteration
.
However
,
when
the
news
of
this
*NL*
disaster
reached
England
,
our
friends
there
,
whom
we
had
taken
care
to
*NL*
furnish
with
all
the
Assembly
's
answers
to
the
governor
's
messages
,
*NL*
rais
'd
a
clamor
against
the
proprietaries
for
their
meanness
and
*NL*
injustice
in
giving
their
governor
such
instructions
;
some
going
so
far
*NL*
as
to
say
that
,
by
obstructing
the
defense
of
their
province
,
they
*NL*
forfeited
their
right
to
it
.
They
were
intimidated
by
this
,
and
sent
*NL*
orders
to
their
receiver-general
to
add
five
thousand
pounds
of
their
*NL*
money
to
whatever
sum
might
be
given
by
the
Assembly
for
such
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
being
notified
to
the
House
,
was
accepted
in
lieu
of
their
share
*NL*
of
a
general
tax
,
and
a
new
bill
was
form
'd
,
with
an
exempting
clause
,
*NL*
which
passed
accordingly
.
By
this
act
I
was
appointed
one
of
the
*NL*
commissioners
for
disposing
of
the
money
,
sixty
thousand
pounds
.
I
had
*NL*
been
active
in
modelling
the
bill
and
procuring
its
passage
,
and
had
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
drawn
a
bill
for
establishing
and
disciplining
of
a
*NL*
voluntary
militia
,
which
I
carried
thro
'
the
House
without
much
*NL*
difficulty
,
as
care
was
taken
in
it
to
leave
the
Quakers
at
their
*NL*
liberty
.
To
promote
the
association
necessary
to
form
the
militia
,
I
*NL*
wrote
a
dialogue
,
-LSB-

-RSB-
stating
and
answering
all
the
objections
I
could
*NL*
think
of
to
such
a
militia
,
which
was
printed
,
and
had
,
as
I
thought
,
*NL*
great
effect
.

While
the
several
companies
in
the
city
and
country
were
forming
and
*NL*
learning
their
exercise
,
the
governor
prevail
'd
with
me
to
take
charge
*NL*
of
our
North-western
frontier
,
which
was
infested
by
the
enemy
,
and
*NL*
provide
for
the
defense
of
the
inhabitants
by
raising
troops
and
*NL*
building
a
line
of
forts
.
I
undertook
this
military
business
,
tho
'
I
*NL*
did
not
conceive
myself
well
qualified
for
it
.
He
gave
me
a
commission
*NL*
with
full
powers
,
and
a
parcel
of
blank
commissions
for
officers
,
to
be
*NL*
given
to
whom
I
thought
fit
.
I
had
but
little
difficulty
in
raising
*NL*
men
,
having
soon
five
hundred
and
sixty
under
my
command
.
My
son
,
who
*NL*
had
in
the
preceding
war
been
an
officer
in
the
army
rais
'd
against
*NL*
Canada
,
was
my
aid-de-camp
,
and
of
great
use
to
me
.
The
Indians
had
*NL*
burned
Gnadenhut
,
a
village
settled
by
the
Moravians
,
and
massacred
the
*NL*
inhabitants
;
but
the
place
was
thought
a
good
situation
for
one
of
the
*NL*
forts
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
march
thither
,
I
assembled
the
companies
at
Bethlehem
,
the
*NL*
chief
establishment
of
those
people
.
I
was
surprised
to
find
it
in
so
*NL*
good
a
posture
of
defense
;
the
destruction
of
Gnadenhut
had
made
them
*NL*
apprehend
danger
.
The
principal
buildings
were
defended
by
a
stockade
;
*NL*
they
had
purchased
a
quantity
of
arms
and
ammunition
from
New
York
,
and
*NL*
had
even
plac
'd
quantities
of
small
paving
stones
between
the
windows
*NL*
of
their
high
stone
houses
,
for
their
women
to
throw
down
upon
the
*NL*
heads
of
any
Indians
that
should
attempt
to
force
into
them
.
The
armed
*NL*
brethren
,
too
,
kept
watch
,
and
reliev
'd
as
methodically
as
in
any
*NL*
garrison
town
.
In
conversation
with
the
bishop
,
Spangenberg
,
I
*NL*
mention
'd
this
my
surprise
;
for
,
knowing
they
had
obtained
an
act
of
*NL*
Parliament
exempting
them
from
military
duties
in
the
colonies
,
I
had
*NL*
suppos
'd
they
were
conscientiously
scrupulous
of
bearing
arms
.
He
*NL*
answer
'd
me
that
it
was
not
one
of
their
established
principles
,
but
*NL*
that
,
at
the
time
of
their
obtaining
that
act
,
it
was
thought
to
be
a
*NL*
principle
with
many
of
their
people
.
On
this
occasion
,
however
,
they
,
*NL*
to
their
surprise
,
found
it
adopted
by
but
a
few
.
It
seems
they
were
*NL*
either
deceiv
'd
in
themselves
,
or
deceiv
'd
the
Parliament
;
but
common
*NL*
sense
,
aided
by
present
danger
,
will
sometimes
be
too
strong
for
*NL*
whimsical
opinions
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
beginning
of
January
when
we
set
out
upon
this
business
of
*NL*
building
forts
.
I
sent
one
detachment
toward
the
Minisink
,
with
*NL*
instructions
to
erect
one
for
the
security
of
that
upper
part
of
the
*NL*
country
,
and
another
to
the
lower
part
,
with
similar
instructions
;
and
*NL*
I
concluded
to
go
myself
with
the
rest
of
my
force
to
Gnadenhut
,
where
*NL*
a
fort
was
tho
'
t
more
immediately
necessary
.
The
Moravians
procur
'd
me
*NL*
five
waggons
for
our
tools
,
stores
,
baggage
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
before
we
left
Bethlehem
,
eleven
farmers
,
who
had
been
driven
from
*NL*
their
plantations
by
the
Indians
,
came
to
me
requesting
a
supply
of
*NL*
firearms
,
that
they
might
go
back
and
fetch
off
their
cattle
.
I
gave
*NL*
them
each
a
gun
with
suitable
ammunition
.
We
had
not
march
'd
many
*NL*
miles
before
it
began
to
rain
,
and
it
continued
raining
all
day
;
there
*NL*
were
no
habitations
on
the
road
to
shelter
us
,
till
we
arriv
'd
near
*NL*
night
at
the
house
of
a
German
,
where
,
and
in
his
barn
,
we
were
all
*NL*
huddled
together
,
as
wet
as
water
could
make
us
.
It
was
well
we
were
*NL*
not
attack
'd
in
our
march
,
for
our
arms
were
of
the
most
ordinary
sort
,
*NL*
and
our
men
could
not
keep
their
gun
locks
dry
.
The
Indians
are
*NL*
dextrous
in
contrivances
for
that
purpose
,
which
we
had
not
.
They
met
*NL*
that
day
the
eleven
poor
farmers
above
mentioned
,
and
killed
ten
of
*NL*
them
.
The
one
who
escap
'd
inform
'd
that
his
and
his
companions
'
guns
*NL*
would
not
go
off
,
the
priming
being
wet
with
the
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
being
fair
,
we
continu
'd
our
march
,
and
arriv
'd
at
the
*NL*
desolated
Gnadenhut
.
There
was
a
saw-mill
near
,
round
which
were
left
*NL*
several
piles
of
boards
,
with
which
we
soon
hutted
ourselves
;
an
*NL*
operation
the
more
necessary
at
that
inclement
season
,
as
we
had
no
*NL*
tents
.
Our
first
work
was
to
bury
more
effectually
the
dead
we
found
*NL*
there
,
who
had
been
half
interr
'd
by
the
country
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
our
fort
was
plann
'd
and
mark
'd
out
,
the
circumference
*NL*
measuring
four
hundred
and
fifty-five
feet
,
which
would
require
as
many
*NL*
palisades
to
be
made
of
trees
,
one
with
another
,
of
a
foot
diameter
*NL*
each
.
Our
axes
,
of
which
we
had
seventy
,
were
immediately
set
to
work
*NL*
to
cut
down
trees
,
and
,
our
men
being
dextrous
in
the
use
of
them
,
*NL*
great
despatch
was
made
.
Seeing
the
trees
fall
so
fast
,
I
had
the
*NL*
curiosity
to
look
at
my
watch
when
two
men
began
to
cut
at
a
pine
;
in
*NL*
six
minutes
they
had
it
upon
the
ground
,
and
I
found
it
of
fourteen
*NL*
inches
diameter
.
Each
pine
made
three
palisades
of
eighteen
feet
long
,
*NL*
pointed
at
one
end
.
While
these
were
preparing
,
our
other
men
dug
a
*NL*
trench
all
round
,
of
three
feet
deep
,
in
which
the
palisades
were
to
be
*NL*
planted
;
and
,
our
waggons
,
the
bodys
being
taken
off
,
and
the
fore
and
*NL*
hind
wheels
separated
by
taking
out
the
pin
which
united
the
two
parts
*NL*
of
the
perch
,
we
had
ten
carriages
,
with
two
horses
each
,
to
bring
the
*NL*
palisades
from
the
woods
to
the
spot
.
When
they
were
set
up
,
our
*NL*
carpenters
built
a
stage
of
boards
all
round
within
,
about
six
feet
*NL*
high
,
for
the
men
to
stand
on
when
to
fire
thro
'
the
loopholes
.
We
had
*NL*
one
swivel
gun
,
which
we
mounted
on
one
of
the
angles
,
and
fir
'd
it
as
*NL*
soon
as
fix
'd
,
to
let
the
Indians
know
,
if
any
were
within
hearing
,
*NL*
that
we
had
such
pieces
;
and
thus
our
fort
,
if
such
a
magnificent
name
*NL*
may
be
given
to
so
miserable
a
stockade
,
was
finish
'd
in
a
week
,
though
*NL*
it
rain
'd
so
hard
every
other
day
that
the
men
could
not
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gave
me
occasion
to
observe
,
that
,
when
men
are
employ
'd
,
they
are
*NL*
best
content
'd
;
for
on
the
days
they
worked
they
were
good-natur
'd
and
*NL*
cheerful
,
and
,
with
the
consciousness
of
having
done
a
good
day
's
work
,
*NL*
they
spent
the
evening
jollily
;
but
on
our
idle
days
they
were
mutinous
*NL*
and
quarrelsome
,
finding
fault
with
their
pork
,
the
bread
,
etc.
,
and
in
*NL*
continual
ill-humor
,
which
put
me
in
mind
of
a
sea-captain
,
whose
rule
*NL*
it
was
to
keep
his
men
constantly
at
work
;
and
,
when
his
mate
once
told
*NL*
him
that
they
had
done
every
thing
,
and
there
was
nothing
further
to
*NL*
employ
them
about
,
``
Oh
,
''
says
he
,
``
Make
them
scour
the
anchor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
kind
of
fort
,
however
contemptible
,
is
a
sufficient
defense
*NL*
against
Indians
,
who
have
no
cannon
.
Finding
ourselves
now
posted
*NL*
securely
,
and
having
a
place
to
retreat
to
on
occasion
,
we
ventur
'd
out
*NL*
in
parties
to
scour
the
adjacent
country
.
We
met
with
no
Indians
,
but
*NL*
we
found
the
places
on
the
neighboring
hills
where
they
had
lain
to
*NL*
watch
our
proceedings
.
There
was
an
art
in
their
contrivance
of
those
*NL*
places
,
that
seems
worth
mention
.
It
being
winter
,
a
fire
was
*NL*
necessary
for
them
;
but
a
common
fire
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
*NL*
would
by
its
light
have
discovered
their
position
at
a
distance
.
They
*NL*
had
therefore
dug
holes
in
the
ground
about
three
feet
diameter
,
and
*NL*
somewhat
deeper
;
we
saw
where
they
had
with
their
hatchets
cut
off
the
*NL*
charcoal
from
the
sides
of
burnt
logs
lying
in
the
woods
.
With
these
*NL*
coals
they
had
made
small
fires
in
the
bottom
of
the
holes
,
and
we
*NL*
observ
'd
among
the
weeds
and
grass
the
prints
of
their
bodies
,
made
by
*NL*
their
laying
all
round
,
with
their
legs
hanging
down
in
the
holes
to
*NL*
keep
their
feet
warm
,
which
,
with
them
,
is
an
essential
point
.
This
*NL*
kind
of
fire
,
so
manag
'd
,
could
not
discover
them
,
either
by
its
light
,
*NL*
flame
,
sparks
,
or
even
smoke
:
it
appear
'd
that
their
number
was
not
*NL*
great
,
and
it
seems
they
saw
we
were
too
many
to
be
attacked
by
them
*NL*
with
prospect
of
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
for
our
chaplain
a
zealous
Presbyterian
minister
,
Mr.
Beatty
,
*NL*
who
complained
to
me
that
the
men
did
not
generally
attend
his
prayers
*NL*
and
exhortations
.
When
they
enlisted
,
they
were
promised
,
besides
pay
*NL*
and
provisions
,
a
gill
of
rum
a
day
,
which
was
punctually
serv
'd
out
to
*NL*
them
,
half
in
the
morning
,
and
the
other
half
in
the
evening
;
and
I
*NL*
observ
'd
they
were
as
punctual
in
attending
to
receive
it
;
upon
which
I
*NL*
said
to
Mr.
Beatty
,
``
It
is
,
perhaps
,
below
the
dignity
of
your
*NL*
profession
to
act
as
steward
of
the
rum
,
but
if
you
were
to
deal
it
out
*NL*
and
only
just
after
prayers
,
you
would
have
them
all
about
you
.
''
He
*NL*
liked
the
tho
`
t
,
undertook
the
office
,
and
,
with
the
help
of
a
few
*NL*
hands
to
measure
out
the
liquor
,
executed
it
to
satisfaction
,
and
never
*NL*
were
prayers
more
generally
and
more
punctually
attended
;
so
that
I
*NL*
thought
this
method
preferable
to
the
punishment
inflicted
by
some
*NL*
military
laws
for
non-attendance
on
divine
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
hardly
finish
'd
this
business
,
and
got
my
fort
well
stor
'd
with
*NL*
provisions
,
when
I
receiv
'd
a
letter
from
the
governor
,
acquainting
me
*NL*
that
he
had
call
'd
the
Assembly
,
and
wished
my
attendance
there
,
if
the
*NL*
posture
of
affairs
on
the
frontiers
was
such
that
my
remaining
there
*NL*
was
no
longer
necessary
.
My
friends
,
too
,
of
the
Assembly
,
pressing
me
*NL*
by
their
letters
to
be
,
if
possible
,
at
the
meeting
,
and
my
three
*NL*
intended
forts
being
now
compleated
,
and
the
inhabitants
contented
to
*NL*
remain
on
their
farms
under
that
protection
,
I
resolved
to
return
;
the
*NL*
more
willingly
,
as
a
New
England
officer
,
Colonel
Clapham
,
experienced
*NL*
in
Indian
war
,
being
on
a
visit
to
our
establishment
,
consented
to
*NL*
accept
the
command
.
I
gave
him
a
commission
,
and
,
parading
the
*NL*
garrison
,
had
it
read
before
them
,
and
introduc
'd
him
to
them
as
an
*NL*
officer
who
,
from
his
skill
in
military
affairs
,
was
much
more
fit
to
*NL*
command
them
than
myself
;
and
,
giving
them
a
little
exhortation
,
took
*NL*
my
leave
.
I
was
escorted
as
far
as
Bethlehem
,
where
I
rested
a
few
*NL*
days
to
recover
from
the
fatigue
I
had
undergone
.
The
first
night
,
*NL*
being
in
a
good
bed
,
I
could
hardly
sleep
,
it
was
so
different
from
my
*NL*
hard
lodging
on
the
floor
of
our
hut
at
Gnaden
wrapt
only
in
a
blanket
*NL*
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
at
Bethlehem
,
I
inquir
'd
a
little
into
the
practice
of
the
*NL*
Moravians
:
some
of
them
had
accompanied
me
,
and
all
were
very
kind
to
*NL*
me
.
I
found
they
work
'd
for
a
common
stock
,
eat
at
common
tables
,
and
*NL*
slept
in
common
dormitories
,
great
numbers
together
.
In
the
*NL*
dormitories
I
observed
loopholes
,
at
certain
distances
all
along
just
*NL*
under
the
ceiling
,
which
I
thought
judiciously
placed
for
change
of
*NL*
air
.
I
was
at
their
church
,
where
I
was
entertain
'd
with
good
musick
,
*NL*
the
organ
being
accompanied
with
violins
,
hautboys
,
flutes
,
clarinets
,
*NL*
etc.
.
I
understood
that
their
sermons
were
not
usually
preached
to
*NL*
mixed
congregations
of
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
as
is
our
common
*NL*
practice
,
but
that
they
assembled
sometimes
the
married
men
,
at
other
*NL*
times
their
wives
,
then
the
young
men
,
the
young
women
,
and
the
little
*NL*
children
,
each
division
by
itself
.
The
sermon
I
heard
was
to
the
*NL*
latter
,
who
came
in
and
were
plac
'd
in
rows
on
benches
;
the
boys
under
*NL*
the
conduct
of
a
young
man
,
their
tutor
,
and
the
girls
conducted
by
a
*NL*
young
woman
.
The
discourse
seem
'd
well
adapted
to
their
capacities
,
*NL*
and
was
deliver
'd
in
a
pleasing
,
familiar
manner
,
coaxing
them
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
to
be
good
.
They
behav
'd
very
orderly
,
but
looked
pale
and
*NL*
unhealthy
,
which
made
me
suspect
they
were
kept
too
much
within
doors
,
*NL*
or
not
allow
'd
sufficient
exercise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
inquir
'd
concerning
the
Moravian
marriages
,
whether
the
report
was
*NL*
true
that
they
were
by
lot
.
I
was
told
that
lots
were
us
'd
only
in
*NL*
particular
cases
;
that
generally
,
when
a
young
man
found
himself
*NL*
dispos
'd
to
marry
,
he
inform
'd
the
elders
of
his
class
,
who
consulted
*NL*
the
elder
ladies
that
govern
'd
the
young
women
.
As
these
elders
of
the
*NL*
different
sexes
were
well
acquainted
with
the
tempers
and
dispositions
*NL*
of
their
respective
pupils
,
they
could
best
judge
what
matches
were
*NL*
suitable
,
and
their
judgments
were
generally
acquiesc
'd
in
;
but
if
,
for
*NL*
example
,
it
should
happen
that
two
or
three
young
women
were
found
to
*NL*
be
equally
proper
for
the
young
man
,
the
lot
was
then
recurred
to
.
I
*NL*
objected
,
if
the
matches
are
not
made
by
the
mutual
choice
of
the
*NL*
parties
,
some
of
them
may
chance
to
be
very
unhappy
.
``
And
so
they
*NL*
may
,
''
answer
'd
my
informer
,
``
if
you
let
the
parties
chuse
for
*NL*
themselves
;
''
which
,
indeed
,
I
could
not
deny
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
returned
to
Philadelphia
,
I
found
the
association
went
on
*NL*
swimmingly
,
the
inhabitants
that
were
not
Quakers
having
pretty
*NL*
generally
come
into
it
,
formed
themselves
into
companies
,
and
chose
*NL*
their
captains
,
lieutenants
,
and
ensigns
,
according
to
the
new
law
.
*NL*
Dr.
B.
visited
me
,
and
gave
me
an
account
of
the
pains
he
had
taken
to
*NL*
spread
a
general
good
liking
to
the
law
,
and
ascribed
much
to
those
*NL*
endeavors
.
I
had
had
the
vanity
to
ascribe
all
to
my
Dialogue
;
*NL*
however
,
not
knowing
but
that
he
might
be
in
the
right
,
I
let
him
enjoy
*NL*
his
opinion
,
which
I
take
to
be
generally
the
best
way
in
such
cases
.
*NL*
The
officers
,
meeting
,
chose
me
to
be
colonel
of
the
regiment
,
which
I
*NL*
this
time
accepted
.
I
forget
how
many
companies
we
had
,
but
we
paraded
*NL*
about
twelve
hundred
well-looking
men
,
with
a
company
of
artillery
,
who
*NL*
had
been
furnished
with
six
brass
field-pieces
,
which
they
had
become
*NL*
so
expert
in
the
use
of
as
to
fire
twelve
times
in
a
minute
.
The
first
*NL*
time
I
reviewed
my
regiment
they
accompanied
me
to
my
house
,
and
would
*NL*
salute
me
with
some
rounds
fired
before
my
door
,
which
shook
down
and
*NL*
broke
several
glasses
of
my
electrical
apparatus
.
And
my
new
honour
*NL*
proved
not
much
less
brittle
;
for
all
our
commissions
were
soon
after
*NL*
broken
by
a
repeal
of
the
law
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
short
time
of
my
colonelship
,
being
about
to
set
out
on
a
*NL*
journey
to
Virginia
,
the
officers
of
my
regiment
took
it
into
their
*NL*
heads
that
it
would
be
proper
for
them
to
escort
me
out
of
town
,
as
far
*NL*
as
the
Lower
Ferry
.
Just
as
I
was
getting
on
horseback
they
came
to
my
*NL*
door
,
between
thirty
and
forty
,
mounted
,
and
all
in
their
uniforms
.
I
*NL*
had
not
been
previously
acquainted
with
the
project
,
or
I
should
have
*NL*
prevented
it
,
being
naturally
averse
to
the
assuming
of
state
on
any
*NL*
occasion
;
and
I
was
a
good
deal
chagrin
'd
at
their
appearance
,
as
I
*NL*
could
not
avoid
their
accompanying
me
.
What
made
it
worse
was
,
that
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
we
began
to
move
,
they
drew
their
swords
and
rode
with
them
*NL*
naked
all
the
way
.
Somebody
wrote
an
account
of
this
to
the
*NL*
proprietor
,
and
it
gave
him
great
offense
.
No
such
honor
had
been
paid
*NL*
him
when
in
the
province
,
nor
to
any
of
his
governors
;
and
he
said
it
*NL*
was
only
proper
to
princes
of
the
blood
royal
,
which
may
be
true
for
*NL*
aught
I
know
,
who
was
,
and
still
am
,
ignorant
of
the
etiquette
in
such
*NL*
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
silly
affair
,
however
,
greatly
increased
his
rancour
against
me
,
*NL*
which
was
before
not
a
little
,
on
account
of
my
conduct
in
the
Assembly
*NL*
respecting
the
exemption
of
his
estate
from
taxation
,
which
I
had
*NL*
always
oppos
'd
very
warmly
,
and
not
without
severe
reflections
on
his
*NL*
meanness
and
injustice
of
contending
for
it
.
He
accused
me
to
the
*NL*
ministry
as
being
the
great
obstacle
to
the
king
's
service
,
preventing
,
*NL*
by
my
influence
in
the
House
,
the
proper
form
of
the
bills
for
raising
*NL*
money
,
and
he
instanced
this
parade
with
my
officers
as
a
proof
of
my
*NL*
having
an
intention
to
take
the
government
of
the
province
out
of
his
*NL*
hands
by
force
.
He
also
applied
to
Sir
Everard
Fawkener
,
the
*NL*
postmaster-general
,
to
deprive
me
of
my
office
;
but
it
had
no
other
*NL*
effect
than
to
procure
from
Sir
Everard
a
gentle
admonition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
continual
wrangle
between
the
governor
and
the
*NL*
House
,
in
which
I
,
as
a
member
,
had
so
large
a
share
,
there
still
*NL*
subsisted
a
civil
intercourse
between
that
gentleman
and
myself
,
and
we
*NL*
never
had
any
personal
difference
.
I
have
sometimes
since
thought
that
*NL*
his
little
or
no
resentment
against
me
,
for
the
answers
it
was
known
I
*NL*
drew
up
to
his
messages
,
might
be
the
effect
of
professional
habit
,
and
*NL*
that
,
being
bred
a
lawyer
,
he
might
consider
us
both
as
merely
*NL*
advocates
for
contending
clients
in
a
suit
,
he
for
the
proprietaries
*NL*
and
I
for
the
Assembly
.
He
would
,
therefore
,
sometimes
call
in
a
*NL*
friendly
way
to
advise
with
me
on
difficult
points
,
and
sometimes
,
tho
'
*NL*
not
often
,
take
my
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
acted
in
concert
to
supply
Braddock
's
army
with
provisions
;
and
,
*NL*
when
the
shocking
news
arrived
of
his
defeat
,
the
governor
sent
in
*NL*
haste
for
me
,
to
consult
with
him
on
measures
for
preventing
the
*NL*
desertion
of
the
back
counties
.
I
forget
now
the
advice
I
gave
;
but
I
*NL*
think
it
was
,
that
Dunbar
should
be
written
to
,
and
prevail
'd
with
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
to
post
his
troops
on
the
frontiers
for
their
protection
,
*NL*
till
,
by
re-enforcements
from
the
colonies
,
he
might
be
able
to
proceed
*NL*
on
the
expedition
.
And
,
after
my
return
from
the
frontier
,
he
would
*NL*
have
had
me
undertake
the
conduct
of
such
an
expedition
with
provincial
*NL*
troops
,
for
the
reduction
of
Fort
Duquesne
,
Dunbar
and
his
men
being
*NL*
otherwise
employed
;
and
he
proposed
to
commission
me
as
general
.
I
had
*NL*
not
so
good
an
opinion
of
my
military
abilities
as
he
profess
'd
to
*NL*
have
,
and
I
believe
his
professions
must
have
exceeded
his
real
*NL*
sentiments
;
but
probably
he
might
think
that
my
popularity
would
*NL*
facilitate
the
raising
of
the
men
,
and
my
influence
in
Assembly
,
the
*NL*
grant
of
money
to
pay
them
,
and
that
,
perhaps
,
without
taxing
the
*NL*
proprietary
estate
.
Finding
me
not
so
forward
to
engage
as
he
*NL*
expected
,
the
project
was
dropt
,
and
he
soon
after
left
the
government
,
*NL*
being
superseded
by
Captain
Denny
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
proceed
in
relating
the
part
I
had
in
public
affairs
under
*NL*
this
new
governor
's
administration
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
here
to
give
*NL*
some
account
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
my
philosophical
reputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1746
,
being
at
Boston
,
I
met
there
with
a
Dr.
Spence
,
who
was
lately
*NL*
arrived
from
Scotland
,
and
show
'd
me
some
electric
experiments
.
They
*NL*
were
imperfectly
perform
'd
,
as
he
was
not
very
expert
;
but
,
being
on
a
*NL*
subject
quite
new
to
me
,
they
equally
surpris
'd
and
pleased
me
.
Soon
*NL*
after
my
return
to
Philadelphia
,
our
library
company
receiv
'd
from
Mr.
*NL*
P.
Collinson
,
Fellow
of
the
Royal
Society
of
London
,
a
present
of
a
*NL*
glass
tube
,
with
some
account
of
the
use
of
it
in
making
such
*NL*
experiments
.
I
eagerly
seized
the
opportunity
of
repeating
what
I
had
*NL*
seen
at
Boston
;
and
,
by
much
practice
,
acquir
'd
great
readiness
in
*NL*
performing
those
,
also
,
which
we
had
an
account
of
from
England
,
adding
*NL*
a
number
of
new
ones
.
I
say
much
practice
,
for
my
house
was
*NL*
continually
full
,
for
some
time
,
with
people
who
came
to
see
these
new
*NL*
wonders
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
divide
a
little
this
incumbrance
among
my
friends
,
I
caused
a
number
*NL*
of
similar
tubes
to
be
blown
at
our
glass-house
,
with
which
they
*NL*
furnish
'd
themselves
,
so
that
we
had
at
length
several
performers
.
*NL*
Among
these
,
the
principal
was
Mr.
Kinnersley
,
an
ingenious
neighbor
,
*NL*
who
,
being
out
of
business
,
I
encouraged
to
undertake
showing
the
*NL*
experiments
for
money
,
and
drew
up
for
him
two
lectures
,
in
which
the
*NL*
experiments
were
rang
'd
in
such
order
,
and
accompanied
with
such
*NL*
explanations
in
such
method
,
as
that
the
foregoing
should
assist
in
*NL*
comprehending
the
following
.
He
procur
'd
an
elegant
apparatus
for
the
*NL*
purpose
,
in
which
all
the
little
machines
that
I
had
roughly
made
for
*NL*
myself
were
nicely
form
'd
by
instrument-makers
.
His
lectures
were
well
*NL*
attended
,
and
gave
great
satisfaction
;
and
after
some
time
he
went
*NL*
thro
'
the
colonies
,
exhibiting
them
in
every
capital
town
,
and
pick
'd
*NL*
up
some
money
.
In
the
West
India
islands
,
indeed
,
it
was
with
*NL*
difficulty
the
experiments
could
be
made
,
from
the
general
moisture
of
*NL*
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oblig
'd
as
we
were
to
Mr.
Collinson
for
his
present
of
the
tube
,
etc.
,
*NL*
I
thought
it
right
he
should
be
inform
'd
of
our
success
in
using
it
,
*NL*
and
wrote
him
several
letters
containing
accounts
of
our
experiments
.
*NL*
He
got
them
read
in
the
Royal
Society
,
where
they
were
not
at
first
*NL*
thought
worth
so
much
notice
as
to
be
printed
in
their
Transactions
.
*NL*
One
paper
,
which
I
wrote
for
Mr.
Kinnersley
,
on
the
sameness
of
*NL*
lightning
with
electricity
,
I
sent
to
Dr.
Mitchel
,
an
acquaintance
of
*NL*
mine
,
and
one
of
the
members
also
of
that
society
,
who
wrote
me
word
*NL*
that
it
had
been
read
,
but
was
laughed
at
by
the
connoisseurs
.
The
*NL*
papers
,
however
,
being
shown
to
Dr.
Fothergill
,
he
thought
them
of
too
*NL*
much
value
to
be
stifled
,
and
advis
'd
the
printing
of
them
.
Mr.
*NL*
Collinson
then
gave
them
to
Cave
for
publication
in
his
Gentleman
's
*NL*
Magazine
;
but
he
chose
to
print
them
separately
in
a
pamphlet
,
and
Dr.
*NL*
Fothergill
wrote
the
preface
.
Cave
,
it
seems
,
judged
rightly
for
his
*NL*
profit
,
for
by
the
additions
that
arrived
afterward
they
swell
'd
to
a
*NL*
quarto
volume
,
which
has
had
five
editions
,
and
cost
him
nothing
for
*NL*
copy-money
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
however
,
some
time
before
those
papers
were
much
taken
notice
*NL*
of
in
England
.
A
copy
of
them
happening
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
Count
de
Buffon
,
a
philosopher
deservedly
of
great
reputation
in
*NL*
France
,
and
,
indeed
,
all
over
Europe
,
he
prevailed
with
M.
Dalibard
to
*NL*
translate
them
into
French
,
and
they
were
printed
at
Paris
.
The
*NL*
publication
offended
the
Abbe
Nollet
,
preceptor
in
Natural
Philosophy
*NL*
to
the
royal
family
,
and
an
able
experimenter
,
who
had
form
'd
and
*NL*
publish
'd
a
theory
of
electricity
,
which
then
had
the
general
vogue
.
*NL*
He
could
not
at
first
believe
that
such
a
work
came
from
America
,
and
*NL*
said
it
must
have
been
fabricated
by
his
enemies
at
Paris
,
to
decry
his
*NL*
system
.
Afterwards
,
having
been
assur
'd
that
there
really
existed
such
*NL*
a
person
as
Franklin
at
Philadelphia
,
which
he
had
doubted
,
he
wrote
*NL*
and
published
a
volume
of
Letters
,
chiefly
address
'd
to
me
,
defending
*NL*
his
theory
,
and
denying
the
verity
of
my
experiments
,
and
of
the
*NL*
positions
deduc
'd
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
once
purpos
'd
answering
the
abbe
,
and
actually
began
the
answer
;
but
,
*NL*
on
consideration
that
my
writings
contain
'd
a
description
of
*NL*
experiments
which
any
one
might
repeat
and
verify
,
and
if
not
to
be
*NL*
verifi
'd
,
could
not
be
defended
;
or
of
observations
offer
'd
as
*NL*
conjectures
,
and
not
delivered
dogmatically
,
therefore
not
laying
me
*NL*
under
any
obligation
to
defend
them
;
and
reflecting
that
a
dispute
*NL*
between
two
persons
,
writing
in
different
languages
,
might
be
*NL*
lengthened
greatly
by
mistranslations
,
and
thence
misconceptions
of
one
*NL*
another
's
meaning
,
much
of
one
of
the
abbe
's
letters
being
founded
on
*NL*
an
error
in
the
translation
,
I
concluded
to
let
my
papers
shift
for
*NL*
themselves
,
believing
it
was
better
to
spend
what
time
I
could
spare
*NL*
from
public
business
in
making
new
experiments
,
than
in
disputing
about
*NL*
those
already
made
.
I
therefore
never
answered
M.
Nollet
,
and
the
*NL*
event
gave
me
no
cause
to
repent
my
silence
;
for
my
friend
M.
le
Roy
,
*NL*
of
the
Royal
Academy
of
Sciences
,
took
up
my
cause
and
refuted
him
;
my
*NL*
book
was
translated
into
the
Italian
,
German
,
and
Latin
languages
;
and
*NL*
the
doctrine
it
contain
'd
was
by
degrees
universally
adopted
by
the
*NL*
philosophers
of
Europe
,
in
preference
to
that
of
the
abbe
;
so
that
he
*NL*
lived
to
see
himself
the
last
of
his
sect
,
except
Monsieur
B
--
,
of
*NL*
Paris
,
his
eleve
and
immediate
disciple
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
gave
my
book
the
more
sudden
and
general
celebrity
,
was
the
*NL*
success
of
one
of
its
proposed
experiments
,
made
by
Messrs.
Dalibard
*NL*
and
De
Lor
at
Marly
,
for
drawing
lightning
from
the
clouds
.
This
*NL*
engag
'd
the
public
attention
every
where
.
M.
de
Lor
,
who
had
an
*NL*
apparatus
for
experimental
philosophy
,
and
lectur
'd
in
that
branch
of
*NL*
science
,
undertook
to
repeat
what
he
called
the
Philadelphia
*NL*
Experiments
;
and
,
after
they
were
performed
before
the
king
and
court
,
*NL*
all
the
curious
of
Paris
flocked
to
see
them
.
I
will
not
swell
this
*NL*
narrative
with
an
account
of
that
capital
experiment
,
nor
of
the
*NL*
infinite
pleasure
I
receiv
'd
in
the
success
of
a
similar
one
I
made
*NL*
soon
after
with
a
kite
at
Philadelphia
,
as
both
are
to
be
found
in
the
*NL*
histories
of
electricity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Wright
,
an
English
physician
,
when
at
Paris
,
wrote
to
a
friend
,
who
*NL*
was
of
the
Royal
Society
,
an
account
of
the
high
esteem
my
experiments
*NL*
were
in
among
the
learned
abroad
,
and
of
their
wonder
that
my
writings
*NL*
had
been
so
little
noticed
in
England
.
The
society
,
on
this
,
resum
'd
*NL*
the
consideration
of
the
letters
that
had
been
read
to
them
;
and
the
*NL*
celebrated
Dr.
Watson
drew
up
a
summary
account
of
them
,
and
of
all
I
*NL*
had
afterwards
sent
to
England
on
the
subject
,
which
he
accompanied
*NL*
with
some
praise
of
the
writer
.
This
summary
was
then
printed
in
their
*NL*
Transactions
;
and
some
members
of
the
society
in
London
,
particularly
*NL*
the
very
ingenious
Mr.
Canton
,
having
verified
the
experiment
of
*NL*
procuring
lightning
from
the
clouds
by
a
pointed
rod
,
and
acquainting
*NL*
them
with
the
success
,
they
soon
made
me
more
than
amends
for
the
*NL*
slight
with
which
they
had
before
treated
me
.
Without
my
having
made
*NL*
any
application
for
that
honor
,
they
chose
me
a
member
,
and
voted
that
*NL*
I
should
be
excus
'd
the
customary
payments
,
which
would
have
amounted
*NL*
to
twenty-five
guineas
;
and
ever
since
have
given
me
their
Transactions
*NL*
gratis
.
They
also
presented
me
with
the
gold
medal
of
Sir
Godfrey
*NL*
Copley
for
the
year
1753
,
the
delivery
of
which
was
accompanied
by
a
*NL*
very
handsome
speech
of
the
president
,
Lord
Macclesfield
,
wherein
I
was
*NL*
highly
honoured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
new
governor
,
Captain
Denny
,
brought
over
for
me
the
*NL*
before-mentioned
medal
from
the
Royal
Society
,
which
he
presented
to
me
*NL*
at
an
entertainment
given
him
by
the
city
.
He
accompanied
it
with
very
*NL*
polite
expressions
of
his
esteem
for
me
,
having
,
as
he
said
,
been
long
*NL*
acquainted
with
my
character
.
After
dinner
,
when
the
company
,
as
was
*NL*
customary
at
that
time
,
were
engag
'd
in
drinking
,
he
took
me
aside
into
*NL*
another
room
,
and
acquainted
me
that
he
had
been
advis
'd
by
his
friends
*NL*
in
England
to
cultivate
a
friendship
with
me
,
as
one
who
was
capable
of
*NL*
giving
him
the
best
advice
,
and
of
contributing
most
effectually
to
the
*NL*
making
his
administration
easy
;
that
he
therefore
desired
of
all
things
*NL*
to
have
a
good
understanding
with
me
,
and
he
begg
'd
me
to
be
assur
'd
of
*NL*
his
readiness
on
all
occasions
to
render
me
every
service
that
might
be
*NL*
in
his
power
.
He
said
much
to
me
,
also
,
of
the
proprietor
's
good
*NL*
disposition
towards
the
province
,
and
of
the
advantage
it
might
be
to
*NL*
us
all
,
and
to
me
in
particular
,
if
the
opposition
that
had
been
so
*NL*
long
continu
'd
to
his
measures
was
dropt
,
and
harmony
restor
'd
between
*NL*
him
and
the
people
;
in
effecting
which
,
it
was
thought
no
one
could
be
*NL*
more
serviceable
than
myself
;
and
I
might
depend
on
adequate
*NL*
acknowledgments
and
recompenses
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
The
drinkers
,
finding
we
*NL*
did
not
return
immediately
to
the
table
,
sent
us
a
decanter
of
Madeira
,
*NL*
which
the
governor
made
liberal
use
of
,
and
in
proportion
became
more
*NL*
profuse
of
his
solicitations
and
promises
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
answers
were
to
this
purpose
:
that
my
circumstances
,
thanks
to
God
,
*NL*
were
such
as
to
make
proprietary
favours
unnecessary
to
me
;
and
that
,
*NL*
being
a
member
of
the
Assembly
,
I
could
not
possibly
accept
of
any
;
*NL*
that
,
however
,
I
had
no
personal
enmity
to
the
proprietary
,
and
that
,
*NL*
whenever
the
public
measures
he
propos
'd
should
appear
to
be
for
the
*NL*
good
of
the
people
,
no
one
should
espouse
and
forward
them
more
*NL*
zealously
than
myself
;
my
past
opposition
having
been
founded
on
this
,
*NL*
that
the
measures
which
had
been
urged
were
evidently
intended
to
serve
*NL*
the
proprietary
interest
,
with
great
prejudice
to
that
of
the
people
;
*NL*
that
I
was
much
obliged
to
him
-LRB-
the
governor
-RRB-
for
his
professions
of
*NL*
regard
to
me
,
and
that
he
might
rely
on
every
thing
in
my
power
to
make
*NL*
his
administration
as
easy
as
possible
,
hoping
at
the
same
time
that
he
*NL*
had
not
brought
with
him
the
same
unfortunate
instruction
his
*NL*
predecessor
had
been
hamper
'd
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
he
did
not
then
explain
himself
;
but
when
he
afterwards
came
to
*NL*
do
business
with
the
Assembly
,
they
appear
'd
again
,
the
disputes
were
*NL*
renewed
,
and
I
was
as
active
as
ever
in
the
opposition
,
being
the
*NL*
penman
,
first
,
of
the
request
to
have
a
communication
of
the
*NL*
instructions
,
and
then
of
the
remarks
upon
them
,
which
may
be
found
in
*NL*
the
votes
of
the
time
,
and
in
the
Historical
Review
I
afterward
*NL*
publish
'd
.
But
between
us
personally
no
enmity
arose
;
we
were
often
*NL*
together
;
he
was
a
man
of
letters
,
had
seen
much
of
the
world
,
and
was
*NL*
very
entertaining
and
pleasing
in
conversation
.
He
gave
me
the
first
*NL*
information
that
my
old
friend
Jas
.
Ralph
was
still
alive
;
that
he
was
*NL*
esteem
'd
one
of
the
best
political
writers
in
England
;
had
been
*NL*
employ
'd
in
the
dispute
between
Prince
Frederic
and
the
king
,
and
had
*NL*
obtain
'd
a
pension
of
three
hundred
a
year
;
that
his
reputation
was
*NL*
indeed
small
as
a
poet
,
Pope
having
damned
his
poetry
in
the
Dunciad
;
*NL*
but
his
prose
was
thought
as
good
as
any
man
's
.

The
Assembly
finally
finding
the
proprietary
obstinately
persisted
*NL*
in
manacling
their
deputies
with
instructions
inconsistent
not
only
*NL*
with
the
privileges
of
the
people
,
but
with
the
service
of
the
crown
,
*NL*
resolv
'd
to
petition
the
king
against
them
,
and
appointed
me
their
*NL*
agent
to
go
over
to
England
,
to
present
and
support
the
petition
.
The
*NL*
House
had
sent
up
a
bill
to
the
governor
,
granting
a
sum
of
sixty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
for
the
king
's
use
-LRB-
ten
thousand
pounds
of
which
was
*NL*
subjected
to
the
orders
of
the
then
general
,
Lord
Loudoun
-RRB-
,
which
the
*NL*
governor
absolutely
refus
'd
to
pass
,
in
compliance
with
his
*NL*
instructions

*NL*
*NL*
I
had
agreed
with
Captain
Morris
,
of
the
paquet
at
New
York
,
for
my
*NL*
passage
,
and
my
stores
were
put
on
board
,
when
Lord
Loudoun
arriv
'd
at
*NL*
Philadelphia
,
expressly
,
as
he
told
me
,
to
endeavor
an
accommodation
*NL*
between
the
governor
and
Assembly
,
that
his
majesty
's
service
might
not
*NL*
be
obstructed
by
their
dissensions
.
Accordingly
,
he
desir
'd
the
*NL*
governor
and
myself
to
meet
him
,
that
he
might
hear
what
was
to
be
said
*NL*
on
both
sides
.
We
met
and
discuss
'd
the
business
.
In
behalf
of
the
*NL*
Assembly
,
I
urg
'd
all
the
various
arguments
that
may
be
found
in
the
*NL*
public
papers
of
that
time
,
which
were
of
my
writing
,
and
are
printed
*NL*
with
the
minutes
of
the
Assembly
;
and
the
governor
pleaded
his
*NL*
instructions
;
the
bond
he
had
given
to
observe
them
,
and
his
ruin
if
he
*NL*
disobey
'd
,
yet
seemed
not
unwilling
to
hazard
himself
if
Lord
Loudoun
*NL*
would
advise
it
.
This
his
lordship
did
not
chuse
to
do
,
though
I
once
*NL*
thought
I
had
nearly
prevail
'd
with
him
to
do
it
;
but
finally
he
rather
*NL*
chose
to
urge
the
compliance
of
the
Assembly
;
and
he
entreated
me
to
*NL*
use
my
endeavours
with
them
for
that
purpose
,
declaring
that
he
would
*NL*
spare
none
of
the
king
's
troops
for
the
defense
of
our
frontiers
,
and
*NL*
that
,
if
we
did
not
continue
to
provide
for
that
defense
ourselves
,
*NL*
they
must
remain
expos
'd
to
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
acquainted
the
House
with
what
had
pass
'd
,
and
,
presenting
them
with
*NL*
a
set
of
resolutions
I
had
drawn
up
,
declaring
our
rights
,
and
that
we
*NL*
did
not
relinquish
our
claim
to
those
rights
,
but
only
suspended
the
*NL*
exercise
of
them
on
this
occasion
thro
'
force
,
against
which
we
*NL*
protested
,
they
at
length
agreed
to
drop
that
bill
,
and
frame
another
*NL*
conformable
to
the
proprietary
instructions
.
This
of
course
the
*NL*
governor
pass
'd
,
and
I
was
then
at
liberty
to
proceed
on
my
voyage
.
*NL*
But
,
in
the
meantime
,
the
paquet
had
sailed
with
my
sea-stores
,
which
*NL*
was
some
loss
to
me
,
and
my
only
recompense
was
his
lordship
's
thanks
*NL*
for
my
service
,
all
the
credit
of
obtaining
the
accommodation
falling
*NL*
to
his
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
out
for
New
York
before
me
;
and
,
as
the
time
for
dispatching
the
*NL*
paquet-boats
was
at
his
disposition
,
and
there
were
two
then
remaining
*NL*
there
,
one
of
which
,
he
said
,
was
to
sail
very
soon
,
I
requested
to
*NL*
know
the
precise
time
,
that
I
might
not
miss
her
by
any
delay
of
mine
.
*NL*
His
answer
was
,
``
I
have
given
out
that
she
is
to
sail
on
Saturday
next
;
*NL*
but
I
may
let
you
know
,
entre
nous
,
that
if
you
are
there
by
Monday
*NL*
morning
,
you
will
be
in
time
,
but
do
not
delay
longer
.
''
By
some
*NL*
accidental
hinderance
at
a
ferry
,
it
was
Monday
noon
before
I
arrived
,
*NL*
and
I
was
much
afraid
she
might
have
sailed
,
as
the
wind
was
fair
;
but
*NL*
I
was
soon
made
easy
by
the
information
that
she
was
still
in
the
*NL*
harbor
,
and
would
not
move
till
the
next
day
.
One
would
imagine
that
I
*NL*
was
now
on
the
very
point
of
departing
for
Europe
.
I
thought
so
;
but
I
*NL*
was
not
then
so
well
acquainted
with
his
lordship
's
character
,
of
which
*NL*
indecision
was
one
of
the
strongest
features
.
I
shall
give
some
*NL*
instances
.
It
was
about
the
beginning
of
April
that
I
came
to
New
*NL*
York
,
and
I
think
it
was
near
the
end
of
June
before
we
sail
'd
.
There
*NL*
were
then
two
of
the
paquet-boats
,
which
had
been
long
in
port
,
but
*NL*
were
detained
for
the
general
's
letters
,
which
were
always
to
be
ready
*NL*
to-morrow
.
Another
paquet
arriv
'd
;
she
too
was
detain
'd
;
and
,
before
we
*NL*
sail
'd
,
a
fourth
was
expected
.
Ours
was
the
first
to
be
dispatch
'd
,
as
*NL*
having
been
there
longest
.
Passengers
were
engag
'd
in
all
,
and
some
*NL*
extremely
impatient
to
be
gone
,
and
the
merchants
uneasy
about
their
*NL*
letters
,
and
the
orders
they
had
given
for
insurance
-LRB-
it
being
war
*NL*
time
-RRB-
for
fall
goods
!
but
their
anxiety
avail
'd
nothing
;
his
lordship
's
*NL*
letters
were
not
ready
;
and
yet
whoever
waited
on
him
found
him
always
*NL*
at
his
desk
,
pen
in
hand
,
and
concluded
he
must
needs
write
abundantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
myself
one
morning
to
pay
my
respects
,
I
found
in
his
antechamber
*NL*
one
Innis
,
a
messenger
of
Philadelphia
,
who
had
come
from
thence
*NL*
express
with
a
paquet
from
Governor
Denny
for
the
General
.
He
*NL*
delivered
to
me
some
letters
from
my
friends
there
,
which
occasion
'd
my
*NL*
inquiring
when
he
was
to
return
,
and
where
be
lodg
'd
,
that
I
might
send
*NL*
some
letters
by
him
.
He
told
me
he
was
order
'd
to
call
to-morrow
at
*NL*
nine
for
the
general
's
answer
to
the
governor
,
and
should
set
off
*NL*
immediately
.
I
put
my
letters
into
his
hands
the
same
day
.
A
*NL*
fortnight
after
I
met
him
again
in
the
same
place
.
``
So
,
you
are
soon
*NL*
return
'd
,
Innis
?
''
``
Returned
!
no
,
I
am
not
gone
yet
.
''
``
How
so
?
''
``
I
*NL*
have
called
here
by
order
every
morning
these
two
weeks
past
for
his
*NL*
lordship
's
letter
,
and
it
is
not
yet
ready
.
''
``
Is
it
possible
,
when
he
*NL*
is
so
great
a
writer
?
for
I
see
him
constantly
at
his
escritoire
.
''
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
says
Innis
,
``
but
he
is
like
St.
George
on
the
signs
,
always
on
*NL*
horseback
,
and
never
rides
on
!
''
This
observation
of
the
messenger
was
,
*NL*
it
seems
,
well
founded
;
for
,
when
in
England
,
I
understood
that
Mr.
*NL*
Pitt
gave
it
as
one
reason
for
removing
this
general
,
and
sending
*NL*
Generals
Amherst
and
Wolfe
,
that
the
minister
never
heard
from
him
,
and
*NL*
could
not
know
what
he
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
daily
expectation
of
sailing
,
and
all
the
three
paquets
going
down
*NL*
to
Sandy
Hook
,
to
join
the
fleet
there
,
the
passengers
thought
it
best
*NL*
to
be
on
board
,
lest
by
a
sudden
order
the
ships
should
sail
,
and
they
*NL*
be
left
behind
.
There
,
if
I
remember
right
,
we
were
about
six
weeks
,
*NL*
consuming
our
sea-stores
,
and
oblig
'd
to
procure
more
.
At
length
the
*NL*
fleet
sail
'd
,
the
General
and
all
his
army
on
board
,
bound
to
*NL*
Louisburg
,
with
intent
to
besiege
and
take
that
fortress
;
all
the
*NL*
paquet-boats
in
company
ordered
to
attend
the
General
's
ship
,
ready
to
*NL*
receive
his
dispatches
when
they
should
be
ready
.
We
were
out
five
*NL*
days
before
we
got
a
letter
with
leave
to
part
,
and
then
our
ship
*NL*
quitted
the
fleet
and
steered
for
England
.
The
other
two
paquets
he
*NL*
still
detained
,
carried
them
with
him
to
Halifax
,
where
he
stayed
some
*NL*
time
to
exercise
the
men
in
sham
attacks
upon
sham
forts
,
then
alter
'd
*NL*
his
mind
as
to
besieging
Louisburg
,
and
return
'd
to
New
York
,
with
all
*NL*
his
troops
,
together
with
the
two
paquets
above
mentioned
,
and
all
*NL*
their
passengers
!
During
his
absence
the
French
and
savages
had
taken
*NL*
Fort
George
,
on
the
frontier
of
that
province
,
and
the
savages
had
*NL*
massacred
many
of
the
garrison
after
capitulation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
afterwards
in
London
Captain
Bonnell
,
who
commanded
one
of
those
*NL*
paquets
.
He
told
me
that
,
when
he
had
been
detain
'd
a
month
,
he
*NL*
acquainted
his
lordship
that
his
ship
was
grown
foul
,
to
a
degree
that
*NL*
must
necessarily
hinder
her
fast
sailing
,
a
point
of
consequence
for
a
*NL*
paquet-boat
,
and
requested
an
allowance
of
time
to
heave
her
down
and
*NL*
clean
her
bottom
.
He
was
asked
how
long
time
that
would
require
.
He
*NL*
answer
'd
,
three
days
.
The
general
replied
,
``
If
you
can
do
it
in
one
*NL*
day
,
I
give
leave
;
otherwise
not
;
for
you
must
certainly
sail
the
day
*NL*
after
to-morrow
.
''
So
he
never
obtain
'd
leave
,
though
detained
*NL*
afterwards
from
day
to
day
during
full
three
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
also
in
London
one
of
Bonnell
's
passengers
,
who
was
so
enrag
'd
*NL*
against
his
lordship
for
deceiving
and
detaining
him
so
long
at
New
*NL*
York
,
and
then
carrying
him
to
Halifax
and
back
again
,
that
he
swore
he
*NL*
would
sue
for
damages
.
Whether
he
did
or
not
,
I
never
heard
;
but
,
as
*NL*
he
represented
the
injury
to
his
affairs
,
it
was
very
considerable
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
,
I
wonder
'd
much
how
such
a
man
came
to
be
intrusted
with
*NL*
so
important
a
business
as
the
conduct
of
a
great
army
;
but
,
having
*NL*
since
seen
more
of
the
great
world
,
and
the
means
of
obtaining
,
and
*NL*
motives
for
giving
places
,
my
wonder
is
diminished
.
General
Shirley
,
*NL*
on
whom
the
command
of
the
army
devolved
upon
the
death
of
Braddock
,
*NL*
would
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
continued
in
place
,
have
made
a
much
better
*NL*
campaign
than
that
of
Loudoun
in
1757
,
which
was
frivolous
,
expensive
,
*NL*
and
disgraceful
to
our
nation
beyond
conception
;
for
,
tho
'
Shirley
was
*NL*
not
a
bred
soldier
,
he
was
sensible
and
sagacious
in
himself
,
and
*NL*
attentive
to
good
advice
from
others
,
capable
of
forming
judicious
*NL*
plans
,
and
quick
and
active
in
carrying
them
into
execution
.
Loudoun
,
*NL*
instead
of
defending
the
colonies
with
his
great
army
,
left
them
*NL*
totally
expos
'd
while
he
paraded
idly
at
Halifax
,
by
which
means
Fort
*NL*
George
was
lost
,
besides
,
he
derang
'd
all
our
mercantile
operations
,
*NL*
and
distress
'd
our
trade
,
by
a
long
embargo
on
the
exportation
of
*NL*
provisions
,
on
pretence
of
keeping
supplies
from
being
obtain
'd
by
the
*NL*
enemy
,
but
in
reality
for
beating
down
their
price
in
favor
of
the
*NL*
contractors
,
in
whose
profits
,
it
was
said
,
perhaps
from
suspicion
*NL*
only
,
he
had
a
share
.
And
,
when
at
length
the
embargo
was
taken
off
,
*NL*
by
neglecting
to
send
notice
of
it
to
Charlestown
,
the
Carolina
fleet
*NL*
was
detain
'd
near
three
months
longer
,
whereby
their
bottoms
were
so
*NL*
much
damaged
by
the
worm
that
a
great
part
of
them
foundered
in
their
*NL*
passage

*NL*
Shirley
was
,
I
believe
,
sincerely
glad
of
being
relieved
from
so
*NL*
burdensome
a
charge
as
the
conduct
of
an
army
must
be
to
a
man
*NL*
unacquainted
with
military
business
.
I
was
at
the
entertainment
given
*NL*
by
the
city
of
New
York
to
Lord
Loudoun
,
on
his
taking
upon
him
the
*NL*
command
.
Shirley
,
tho
'
thereby
superseded
,
was
present
also
.
There
*NL*
was
a
great
company
of
officers
,
citizens
,
and
strangers
,
and
,
some
*NL*
chairs
having
been
borrowed
in
the
neighborhood
,
there
was
one
among
*NL*
them
very
low
,
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
Mr.
Shirley
.
Perceiving
it
as
*NL*
I
sat
by
him
,
I
said
,
``
They
have
given
you
,
sir
,
too
low
a
seat
.
''
``
No
*NL*
matter
,
''
says
he
,
``
Mr.
Franklin
,
I
find
a
low
seat
the
easiest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
,
as
afore
mention
'd
,
detain
'd
at
New
York
,
I
receiv
'd
all
*NL*
the
accounts
of
the
provisions
,
etc.
,
that
I
had
furnish
'd
to
Braddock
,
*NL*
some
of
which
accounts
could
not
sooner
be
obtain
'd
from
the
different
*NL*
persons
I
had
employ
'd
to
assist
in
the
business
.
I
presented
them
to
*NL*
Lord
Loudoun
,
desiring
to
be
paid
the
ballance
.
He
caus
'd
them
to
be
*NL*
regularly
examined
by
the
proper
officer
,
who
,
after
comparing
every
*NL*
article
with
its
voucher
,
certified
them
to
be
right
;
and
the
balance
*NL*
due
for
which
his
lordship
promis
'd
to
give
me
an
order
on
the
*NL*
paymaster
.
This
was
,
however
,
put
off
from
time
to
time
;
and
,
tho
'
I
*NL*
call
'd
often
for
it
by
appointment
,
I
did
not
get
it
.
At
length
,
just
*NL*
before
my
departure
,
he
told
me
he
had
,
on
better
consideration
,
*NL*
concluded
not
to
mix
his
accounts
with
those
of
his
predecessors
.
``
And
*NL*
you
,
''
says
he
,
``
when
in
England
,
have
only
to
exhibit
your
accounts
at
*NL*
the
treasury
,
and
you
will
be
paid
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
mention
'd
,
but
without
effect
,
the
great
and
unexpected
expense
I
had
*NL*
been
put
to
by
being
detain
'd
so
long
at
New
York
,
as
a
reason
for
my
*NL*
desiring
to
be
presently
paid
;
and
on
my
observing
that
it
was
not
*NL*
right
I
should
be
put
to
any
further
trouble
or
delay
in
obtaining
the
*NL*
money
I
had
advanc
'd
,
as
I
charged
no
commission
for
my
service
,
``
O
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
must
not
think
of
persuading
us
that
you
are
no
*NL*
gainer
;
we
understand
better
those
affairs
,
and
know
that
every
one
*NL*
concerned
in
supplying
the
army
finds
means
,
in
the
doing
it
,
to
fill
*NL*
his
own
pockets
.
''
I
assur
'd
him
that
was
not
my
case
,
and
that
I
had
*NL*
not
pocketed
a
farthing
;
but
he
appear
'd
clearly
not
to
believe
me
;
*NL*
and
,
indeed
,
I
have
since
learnt
that
immense
fortunes
are
often
made
*NL*
in
such
employments
.
As
to
my
ballance
,
I
am
not
paid
it
to
this
day
,
*NL*
of
which
more
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
captain
of
the
paquet
had
boasted
much
,
before
we
sailed
,
of
the
*NL*
swiftness
of
his
ship
;
unfortunately
,
when
we
came
to
sea
,
she
proved
*NL*
the
dullest
of
ninety-six
sail
,
to
his
no
small
mortification
.
After
*NL*
many
conjectures
respecting
the
cause
,
when
we
were
near
another
ship
*NL*
almost
as
dull
as
ours
,
which
,
however
,
gain
'd
upon
us
,
the
captain
*NL*
ordered
all
hands
to
come
aft
,
and
stand
as
near
the
ensign
staff
as
*NL*
possible
.
We
were
,
passengers
included
,
about
forty
persons
.
While
we
*NL*
stood
there
,
the
ship
mended
her
pace
,
and
soon
left
her
neighbour
far
*NL*
behind
,
which
prov
'd
clearly
what
our
captain
suspected
,
that
she
was
*NL*
loaded
too
much
by
the
head
.
The
casks
of
water
,
it
seems
,
had
been
*NL*
all
plac
'd
forward
;
these
he
therefore
order
'd
to
be
mov
'd
further
aft
,
*NL*
on
which
the
ship
recover
'd
her
character
,
and
proved
the
sailer
in
the
*NL*
fleet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
said
she
had
once
gone
at
the
rate
of
thirteen
knots
,
which
*NL*
is
accounted
thirteen
miles
per
hour
.
We
had
on
board
,
as
a
passenger
,
*NL*
Captain
Kennedy
,
of
the
Navy
,
who
contended
that
it
was
impossible
,
and
*NL*
that
no
ship
ever
sailed
so
fast
,
and
that
there
must
have
been
some
*NL*
error
in
the
division
of
the
log-line
,
or
some
mistake
in
heaving
the
*NL*
log
.
A
wager
ensu
'd
between
the
two
captains
,
to
be
decided
when
there
*NL*
should
be
sufficient
wind
.
Kennedy
thereupon
examin
'd
rigorously
the
*NL*
log-line
,
and
,
being
satisfi
'd
with
that
,
he
determin
'd
to
throw
the
*NL*
log
himself
.
Accordingly
some
days
after
,
when
the
wind
blew
very
fair
*NL*
and
fresh
,
and
the
captain
of
the
paquet
,
Lutwidge
,
said
he
believ
'd
*NL*
she
then
went
at
the
rate
of
thirteen
knots
,
Kennedy
made
the
*NL*
experiment
,
and
own
'd
his
wager
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
above
fact
I
give
for
the
sake
of
the
following
observation
.
It
*NL*
has
been
remark
'd
,
as
an
imperfection
in
the
art
of
ship-building
,
that
*NL*
it
can
never
be
known
,
till
she
is
tried
,
whether
a
new
ship
will
or
*NL*
will
not
be
a
good
sailer
;
for
that
the
model
of
a
good-sailing
ship
*NL*
has
been
exactly
follow
'd
in
a
new
one
,
which
has
prov
'd
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
remarkably
dull
.
I
apprehend
that
this
may
partly
be
*NL*
occasion
'd
by
the
different
opinions
of
seamen
respecting
the
modes
of
*NL*
lading
,
rigging
,
and
sailing
of
a
ship
;
each
has
his
system
;
and
the
*NL*
same
vessel
,
laden
by
the
judgment
and
orders
of
one
captain
,
shall
*NL*
sail
better
or
worse
than
when
by
the
orders
of
another
.
Besides
,
it
*NL*
scarce
ever
happens
that
a
ship
is
form
'd
,
fitted
for
the
sea
,
and
*NL*
sail
'd
by
the
same
person
.
One
man
builds
the
hull
,
another
rigs
her
,
*NL*
a
third
lades
and
sails
her
.
No
one
of
these
has
the
advantage
of
*NL*
knowing
all
the
ideas
and
experience
of
the
others
,
and
,
therefore
,
can
*NL*
not
draw
just
conclusions
from
a
combination
of
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
in
the
simple
operation
of
sailing
when
at
sea
,
I
have
often
*NL*
observ
'd
different
judgments
in
the
officers
who
commanded
the
*NL*
successive
watches
,
the
wind
being
the
same
.
One
would
have
the
sails
*NL*
trimm
'd
sharper
or
flatter
than
another
,
so
that
they
seem
'd
to
have
no
*NL*
certain
rule
to
govern
by
.
Yet
I
think
a
set
of
experiments
might
be
*NL*
instituted
,
first
,
to
determine
the
most
proper
form
of
the
hull
for
*NL*
swift
sailing
;
next
,
the
best
dimensions
and
properest
place
for
the
*NL*
masts
:
then
the
form
and
quantity
of
sails
,
and
their
position
,
as
the
*NL*
wind
may
be
;
and
,
lastly
,
the
disposition
of
the
lading
.
This
is
an
*NL*
age
of
experiments
,
and
I
think
a
set
accurately
made
and
combin
'd
*NL*
would
be
of
great
use
.
I
am
persuaded
,
therefore
,
that
ere
long
some
*NL*
ingenious
philosopher
will
undertake
it
,
to
whom
I
wish
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
several
times
chas
'd
in
our
passage
,
but
outsail
'd
every
thing
,
*NL*
and
in
thirty
days
had
soundings
.
We
had
a
good
observation
,
and
the
*NL*
captain
judg
'd
himself
so
near
our
port
,
Falmouth
,
that
,
if
we
made
a
*NL*
good
run
in
the
night
,
we
might
be
off
the
mouth
of
that
harbor
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
by
running
in
the
night
might
escape
the
notice
of
the
*NL*
enemy
's
privateers
,
who
often
crus
'd
near
the
entrance
of
the
channel
.
*NL*
Accordingly
,
all
the
sail
was
set
that
we
could
possibly
make
,
and
the
*NL*
wind
being
very
fresh
and
fair
,
we
went
right
before
it
,
and
made
great
*NL*
way
.
The
captain
,
after
his
observation
,
shap
'd
his
course
,
as
he
*NL*
thought
,
so
as
to
pass
wide
of
the
Scilly
Isles
;
but
it
seems
there
is
*NL*
sometimes
a
strong
indraught
setting
up
St.
George
's
Channel
,
which
*NL*
deceives
seamen
and
caused
the
loss
of
Sir
Cloudesley
Shovel
's
*NL*
squadron
.
This
indraught
was
probably
the
cause
of
what
happened
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
watchman
plac
'd
in
the
bow
,
to
whom
they
often
called
,
``
Look
*NL*
well
out
before
there
,
''
and
he
as
often
answered
,
``
Ay
ay
;
''
but
perhaps
*NL*
had
his
eyes
shut
,
and
was
half
asleep
at
the
time
,
they
sometimes
*NL*
answering
,
as
is
said
,
mechanically
;
for
he
did
not
see
a
light
just
*NL*
before
us
,
which
had
been
hid
by
the
studdingsails
from
the
man
at
the
*NL*
helm
,
and
from
the
rest
of
the
watch
,
but
by
an
accidental
yaw
of
the
*NL*
ship
was
discover
'd
,
and
occasion
'd
a
great
alarm
,
we
being
very
near
*NL*
it
,
the
light
appearing
to
me
as
big
as
a
cart-wheel
.
It
was
midnight
,
*NL*
and
our
captain
fast
asleep
;
but
Captain
Kennedy
,
jumping
upon
deck
,
*NL*
and
seeing
the
danger
,
ordered
the
ship
to
wear
round
,
all
sails
*NL*
standing
;
an
operation
dangerous
to
the
masts
,
but
it
carried
us
clear
,
*NL*
and
we
escaped
shipwreck
,
for
we
were
running
right
upon
the
rocks
on
*NL*
which
the
light-house
was
erected
.
This
deliverance
impressed
me
*NL*
strongly
with
the
utility
of
light-houses
,
and
made
me
resolve
to
*NL*
encourage
the
building
more
of
them
in
America
,
if
I
should
live
to
*NL*
return
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
it
was
found
by
the
soundings
,
etc.
,
that
we
were
near
*NL*
our
port
,
but
a
thick
fog
hid
the
land
from
our
sight
.
About
nine
*NL*
o'clock
the
fog
began
to
rise
,
and
seem
'd
to
be
lifted
up
from
the
*NL*
water
like
the
curtain
at
a
play-house
,
discovering
underneath
,
the
*NL*
town
of
Falmouth
,
the
vessels
in
its
harbor
,
and
the
fields
that
*NL*
surrounded
it
.
This
was
a
most
pleasing
spectacle
to
those
who
had
*NL*
been
so
long
without
any
other
prospects
than
the
uniform
view
of
a
*NL*
vacant
ocean
,
and
it
gave
us
the
more
pleasure
as
we
were
now
free
from
*NL*
the
anxieties
which
the
state
of
war
occasion
'd
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
out
immediately
,
with
my
son
,
for
London
,
and
we
only
stopt
a
*NL*
little
by
the
way
to
view
Stonehenge
on
Salisbury
Plain
,
and
Lord
*NL*
Pembroke
's
house
and
gardens
,
with
his
very
curious
antiquities
at
*NL*
Wilton
.
We
arrived
in
London
the
27th
of
July
,
1757
.

Here
terminates
the
Autobiography
,
as
published
by
*NL*
Wm.
Temple
Franklin
and
his
successors
.
What
follows
*NL*
was
written
in
the
last
year
of
Dr.
Franklin
's
life
,
*NL*
and
was
first
printed
-LRB-
in
English
-RRB-
in
Mr.
Bigelow
's
*NL*
edition
of
1868
.
--
ED

*NL*
*NL*
AS
SOON
as
I
was
settled
in
a
lodging
Mr.
Charles
had
provided
for
me
,
*NL*
I
went
to
visit
Dr.
Fothergill
,
to
whom
I
was
strongly
recommended
,
and
*NL*
whose
counsel
respecting
my
proceedings
I
was
advis
'd
to
obtain
.
He
*NL*
was
against
an
immediate
complaint
to
government
,
and
thought
the
*NL*
proprietaries
should
first
be
personally
appli
'd
to
,
who
might
possibly
*NL*
be
induc
'd
by
the
interposition
and
persuasion
of
some
private
friends
,
*NL*
to
accommodate
matters
amicably
.
I
then
waited
on
my
old
friend
and
*NL*
correspondent
,
Mr.
Peter
Collinson
,
who
told
me
that
John
Hanbury
,
the
*NL*
great
Virginia
merchant
,
had
requested
to
be
informed
when
I
should
*NL*
arrive
,
that
he
might
carry
me
to
Lord
Granville
's
,
who
was
then
*NL*
President
of
the
Council
and
wished
to
see
me
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
*NL*
agreed
to
go
with
him
the
next
morning
.
Accordingly
Mr.
Hanbury
called
*NL*
for
me
and
took
me
in
his
carriage
to
that
nobleman
's
,
who
receiv
'd
me
*NL*
with
great
civility
;
and
after
some
questions
respecting
the
present
*NL*
state
of
affairs
in
America
and
discourse
thereupon
,
he
said
to
me
:
*NL*
``
You
Americans
have
wrong
ideas
of
the
nature
of
your
constitution
;
you
*NL*
contend
that
the
king
's
instructions
to
his
governors
are
not
laws
,
and
*NL*
think
yourselves
at
liberty
to
regard
or
disregard
them
at
your
own
*NL*
discretion
.
But
those
instructions
are
not
like
the
pocket
*NL*
instructions
given
to
a
minister
going
abroad
,
for
regulating
his
*NL*
conduct
in
some
trifling
point
of
ceremony
.
They
are
first
drawn
up
by
*NL*
judges
learned
in
the
laws
;
they
are
then
considered
,
debated
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
amended
in
Council
,
after
which
they
are
signed
by
the
king
.
*NL*
They
are
then
,
so
far
as
they
relate
to
you
,
the
law
of
the
land
,
for
*NL*
the
king
is
the
LEGISLATOR
OF
THE
COLONIES
.
''
I
told
his
lordship
this
*NL*
was
new
doctrine
to
me
.
I
had
always
understood
from
our
charters
that
*NL*
our
laws
were
to
be
made
by
our
Assemblies
,
to
be
presented
indeed
to
*NL*
the
king
for
his
royal
assent
,
but
that
being
once
given
the
king
could
*NL*
not
repeal
or
alter
them
.
And
as
the
Assemblies
could
not
make
*NL*
permanent
laws
without
his
assent
,
so
neither
could
he
make
a
law
for
*NL*
them
without
theirs
.
He
assur
'd
me
I
was
totally
mistaken
.
I
did
not
*NL*
think
so
,
however
,
and
his
lordship
's
conversation
having
a
little
*NL*
alarm
'd
me
as
to
what
might
be
the
sentiments
of
the
court
concerning
*NL*
us
,
I
wrote
it
down
as
soon
as
I
return
'd
to
my
lodgings
.
I
*NL*
recollected
that
about
20
years
before
,
a
clause
in
a
bill
brought
into
*NL*
Parliament
by
the
ministry
had
propos
'd
to
make
the
king
's
instructions
*NL*
laws
in
the
colonies
,
but
the
clause
was
thrown
out
by
the
Commons
,
for
*NL*
which
we
adored
them
as
our
friends
and
friends
of
liberty
,
till
by
*NL*
their
conduct
towards
us
in
1765
it
seem
'd
that
they
had
refus
'd
that
*NL*
point
of
sovereignty
to
the
king
only
that
they
might
reserve
it
for
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
days
,
Dr.
Fothergill
having
spoken
to
the
proprietaries
,
*NL*
they
agreed
to
a
meeting
with
me
at
Mr.
T.
Penn
's
house
in
Spring
*NL*
Garden
.
The
conversation
at
first
consisted
of
mutual
declarations
of
*NL*
disposition
to
reasonable
accommodations
,
but
I
suppose
each
party
had
*NL*
its
own
ideas
of
what
should
be
meant
by
reasonable
.
We
then
went
into
*NL*
consideration
of
our
several
points
of
complaint
,
which
I
enumerated
.
*NL*
The
proprietaries
justify
'd
their
conduct
as
well
as
they
could
,
and
I
*NL*
the
Assembly
's
.
We
now
appeared
very
wide
,
and
so
far
from
each
other
*NL*
in
our
opinions
as
to
discourage
all
hope
of
agreement
.
However
,
it
*NL*
was
concluded
that
I
should
give
them
the
heads
of
our
complaints
in
*NL*
writing
,
and
they
promis
'd
then
to
consider
them
.
I
did
so
soon
after
,
*NL*
but
they
put
the
paper
into
the
hands
of
their
solicitor
,
Ferdinand
*NL*
John
Paris
,
who
managed
for
them
all
their
law
business
in
their
great
*NL*
suit
with
the
neighbouring
proprietary
of
Maryland
,
Lord
Baltimore
,
*NL*
which
had
subsisted
70
years
,
and
wrote
for
them
all
their
papers
and
*NL*
messages
in
their
dispute
with
the
Assembly
.
He
was
a
proud
,
angry
*NL*
man
,
and
as
I
had
occasionally
in
the
answers
of
the
Assembly
treated
*NL*
his
papers
with
some
severity
,
they
being
really
weak
in
point
of
*NL*
argument
and
haughty
in
expression
,
he
had
conceived
a
mortal
enmity
to
*NL*
me
,
which
discovering
itself
whenever
we
met
,
I
declin
'd
the
*NL*
proprietary
's
proposal
that
he
and
I
should
discuss
the
heads
of
*NL*
complaint
between
our
two
selves
,
and
refus
'd
treating
with
any
one
but
*NL*
them
.
They
then
by
his
advice
put
the
paper
into
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
Attorney
and
Solicitor-General
for
their
opinion
and
counsel
upon
it
,
*NL*
where
it
lay
unanswered
a
year
wanting
eight
days
,
during
which
time
I
*NL*
made
frequent
demands
of
an
answer
from
the
proprietaries
,
but
without
*NL*
obtaining
any
other
than
that
they
had
not
yet
received
the
opinion
of
*NL*
the
Attorney
and
Solicitor-General
.
What
it
was
when
they
did
receive
*NL*
it
I
never
learnt
,
for
they
did
not
communicate
it
to
me
,
but
sent
a
*NL*
long
message
to
the
Assembly
drawn
and
signed
by
Paris
,
reciting
my
*NL*
paper
,
complaining
of
its
want
of
formality
,
as
a
rudeness
on
my
part
,
*NL*
and
giving
a
flimsy
justification
of
their
conduct
,
adding
that
they
*NL*
should
be
willing
to
accommodate
matters
if
the
Assembly
would
send
out
*NL*
some
person
of
candour
to
treat
with
them
for
that
purpose
,
intimating
*NL*
thereby
that
I
was
not
such
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
want
of
formality
or
rudeness
was
,
probably
,
my
not
having
*NL*
address
'd
the
paper
to
them
with
their
assum
'd
titles
of
True
and
*NL*
Absolute
Proprietaries
of
the
Province
of
Pennsylvania
,
which
I
omitted
*NL*
as
not
thinking
it
necessary
in
a
paper
,
the
intention
of
which
was
*NL*
only
to
reduce
to
a
certainty
by
writing
,
what
in
conversation
I
had
*NL*
delivered
viva
voce
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
during
this
delay
,
the
Assembly
having
prevailed
with
Gov
'
r
Denny
*NL*
to
pass
an
act
taxing
the
proprietary
estate
in
common
with
the
estates
*NL*
of
the
people
,
which
was
the
grand
point
in
dispute
,
they
omitted
*NL*
answering
the
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
act
however
came
over
,
the
proprietaries
,
counselled
by
*NL*
Paris
,
determined
to
oppose
its
receiving
the
royal
assent
.
*NL*
Accordingly
they
petition
'd
the
king
in
Council
,
and
a
hearing
was
*NL*
appointed
in
which
two
lawyers
were
employ
'd
by
them
against
the
act
,
*NL*
and
two
by
me
in
support
of
it
.
They
alledg
'd
that
the
act
was
*NL*
intended
to
load
the
proprietary
estate
in
order
to
spare
those
of
the
*NL*
people
,
and
that
if
it
were
suffer
'd
to
continue
in
force
,
and
the
*NL*
proprietaries
who
were
in
odium
with
the
people
,
left
to
their
mercy
in
*NL*
proportioning
the
taxes
,
they
would
inevitably
be
ruined
.
We
reply
'd
*NL*
that
the
act
had
no
such
intention
,
and
would
have
no
such
effect
.
*NL*
That
the
assessors
were
honest
and
discreet
men
under
an
oath
to
assess
*NL*
fairly
and
equitably
,
and
that
any
advantage
each
of
them
might
expect
*NL*
in
lessening
his
own
tax
by
augmenting
that
of
the
proprietaries
was
*NL*
too
trifling
to
induce
them
to
perjure
themselves
.
This
is
the
purport
*NL*
of
what
I
remember
as
urged
by
both
sides
,
except
that
we
insisted
*NL*
strongly
on
the
mischievous
consequences
that
must
attend
a
repeal
,
for
*NL*
that
the
money
,
L100
,000
,
being
printed
and
given
to
the
king
's
use
,
*NL*
expended
in
his
service
,
and
now
spread
among
the
people
,
the
repeal
*NL*
would
strike
it
dead
in
their
hands
to
the
ruin
of
many
,
and
the
total
*NL*
discouragement
of
future
grants
,
and
the
selfishness
of
the
proprietors
*NL*
in
soliciting
such
a
general
catastrophe
,
merely
from
a
groundless
fear
*NL*
of
their
estate
being
taxed
too
highly
,
was
insisted
on
in
the
*NL*
strongest
terms
.
On
this
,
Lord
Mansfield
,
one
of
the
counsel
rose
,
and
*NL*
beckoning
me
took
me
into
the
clerk
's
chamber
,
while
the
lawyers
were
*NL*
pleading
,
and
asked
me
if
I
was
really
of
opinion
that
no
injury
would
*NL*
be
done
the
proprietary
estate
in
the
execution
of
the
act
.
I
said
*NL*
certainly
.
``
Then
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
can
have
little
objection
to
enter
*NL*
into
an
engagement
to
assure
that
point
.
''
I
answer
'd
,
``
None
at
all
.
''
*NL*
He
then
call
'd
in
Paris
,
and
after
some
discourse
,
his
lordship
's
*NL*
proposition
was
accepted
on
both
sides
;
a
paper
to
the
purpose
was
*NL*
drawn
up
by
the
Clerk
of
the
Council
,
which
I
sign
'd
with
Mr.
Charles
,
*NL*
who
was
also
an
Agent
of
the
Province
for
their
ordinary
affairs
,
when
*NL*
Lord
Mansfield
returned
to
the
Council
Chamber
,
where
finally
the
law
*NL*
was
allowed
to
pass
.
Some
changes
were
however
recommended
and
we
also
*NL*
engaged
they
should
be
made
by
a
subsequent
law
,
but
the
Assembly
did
*NL*
not
think
them
necessary
;
for
one
year
's
tax
having
been
levied
by
the
*NL*
act
before
the
order
of
Council
arrived
,
they
appointed
a
committee
to
*NL*
examine
the
proceedings
of
the
assessors
,
and
on
this
committee
they
*NL*
put
several
particular
friends
of
the
proprietaries
.
After
a
full
*NL*
enquiry
,
they
unanimously
sign
'd
a
report
that
they
found
the
tax
had
*NL*
been
assess
'd
with
perfect
equity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Assembly
looked
into
my
entering
into
the
first
part
of
the
*NL*
engagement
,
as
an
essential
service
to
the
Province
,
since
it
secured
*NL*
the
credit
of
the
paper
money
then
spread
over
all
the
country
.
They
*NL*
gave
me
their
thanks
in
form
when
I
return
'd
.
But
the
proprietaries
*NL*
were
enraged
at
Governor
Denny
for
having
pass
'd
the
act
,
and
turn
'd
*NL*
him
out
with
threats
of
suing
him
for
breach
of
instructions
which
he
*NL*
had
given
bond
to
observe
.
He
,
however
,
having
done
it
at
the
instance
*NL*
of
the
General
,
and
for
His
Majesty
's
service
,
and
having
some
powerful
*NL*
interest
at
court
,
despis
'd
the
threats
and
they
were
never
put
in
*NL*
execution
.
