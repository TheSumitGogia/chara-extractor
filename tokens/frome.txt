I
had
the
story
,
bit
by
bit
,
from
various
people
,
and
,
as
generally
*NL*
happens
in
such
cases
,
each
time
it
was
a
different
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
know
Starkfield
,
Massachusetts
,
you
know
the
post-office
.
If
you
*NL*
know
the
post-office
you
must
have
seen
Ethan
Frome
drive
up
to
it
,
drop
*NL*
the
reins
on
his
hollow-backed
bay
and
drag
himself
across
the
brick
*NL*
pavement
to
the
white
colonnade
;
and
you
must
have
asked
who
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
there
that
,
several
years
ago
,
I
saw
him
for
the
first
time
;
and
*NL*
the
sight
pulled
me
up
sharp
.
Even
then
he
was
the
most
striking
figure
*NL*
in
Starkfield
,
though
he
was
but
the
ruin
of
a
man
.
It
was
not
so
much
*NL*
his
great
height
that
marked
him
,
for
the
``
natives
''
were
easily
singled
*NL*
out
by
their
lank
longitude
from
the
stockier
foreign
breed
:
it
was
the
*NL*
careless
powerful
look
he
had
,
in
spite
of
a
lameness
checking
each
step
*NL*
like
the
jerk
of
a
chain
.
There
was
something
bleak
and
unapproachable
*NL*
in
his
face
,
and
he
was
so
stiffened
and
grizzled
that
I
took
him
for
an
*NL*
old
man
and
was
surprised
to
hear
that
he
was
not
more
than
fifty-two
.
*NL*
I
had
this
from
Harmon
Gow
,
who
had
driven
the
stage
from
Bettsbridge
*NL*
to
Starkfield
in
pre-trolley
days
and
knew
the
chronicle
of
all
the
*NL*
families
on
his
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
looked
that
way
ever
since
he
had
his
smash-up
;
and
that
's
*NL*
twenty-four
years
ago
come
next
February
,
''
Harmon
threw
out
between
*NL*
reminiscent
pauses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
smash-up
''
it
was
--
I
gathered
from
the
same
informant
--
which
,
besides
*NL*
drawing
the
red
gash
across
Ethan
Frome
's
forehead
,
had
so
shortened
and
*NL*
warped
his
right
side
that
it
cost
him
a
visible
effort
to
take
the
few
*NL*
steps
from
his
buggy
to
the
post-office
window
.
He
used
to
drive
in
*NL*
from
his
farm
every
day
at
about
noon
,
and
as
that
was
my
own
hour
for
*NL*
fetching
my
mail
I
often
passed
him
in
the
porch
or
stood
beside
him
*NL*
while
we
waited
on
the
motions
of
the
distributing
hand
behind
the
*NL*
grating
.
I
noticed
that
,
though
he
came
so
punctually
,
he
seldom
*NL*
received
anything
but
a
copy
of
the
Bettsbridge
Eagle
,
which
he
put
*NL*
without
a
glance
into
his
sagging
pocket
.
At
intervals
,
however
,
the
*NL*
post-master
would
hand
him
an
envelope
addressed
to
Mrs.
Zenobia
--
or
Mrs.
*NL*
Zeena
--
Frome
,
and
usually
bearing
conspicuously
in
the
upper
left-hand
*NL*
corner
the
address
of
some
manufacturer
of
patent
medicine
and
the
name
*NL*
of
his
specific
.
These
documents
my
neighbour
would
also
pocket
without
*NL*
a
glance
,
as
if
too
much
used
to
them
to
wonder
at
their
number
and
*NL*
variety
,
and
would
then
turn
away
with
a
silent
nod
to
the
post-master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
in
Starkfield
knew
him
and
gave
him
a
greeting
tempered
to
*NL*
his
own
grave
mien
;
but
his
taciturnity
was
respected
and
it
was
only
on
*NL*
rare
occasions
that
one
of
the
older
men
of
the
place
detained
him
for
*NL*
a
word
.
When
this
happened
he
would
listen
quietly
,
his
blue
eyes
on
the
*NL*
speaker
's
face
,
and
answer
in
so
low
a
tone
that
his
words
never
reached
*NL*
me
;
then
he
would
climb
stiffly
into
his
buggy
,
gather
up
the
reins
in
*NL*
his
left
hand
and
drive
slowly
away
in
the
direction
of
his
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
pretty
bad
smash-up
?
''
I
questioned
Harmon
,
looking
after
*NL*
Frome
's
retreating
figure
,
and
thinking
how
gallantly
his
lean
brown
*NL*
head
,
with
its
shock
of
light
hair
,
must
have
sat
on
his
strong
*NL*
shoulders
before
they
were
bent
out
of
shape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wust
kind
,
''
my
informant
assented
.
``
More
'n
enough
to
kill
most
men
.
But
*NL*
the
Fromes
are
tough
.
Ethan
'll
likely
touch
a
hundred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
At
the
moment
Ethan
Frome
,
after
climbing
to
*NL*
his
seat
,
had
leaned
over
to
assure
himself
of
the
security
of
a
wooden
*NL*
box
--
also
with
a
druggist
's
label
on
it
--
which
he
had
placed
in
the
back
*NL*
of
the
buggy
,
and
I
saw
his
face
as
it
probably
looked
when
he
thought
*NL*
himself
alone
.
``
That
man
touch
a
hundred
?
He
looks
as
if
he
was
dead
and
*NL*
in
hell
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harmon
drew
a
slab
of
tobacco
from
his
pocket
,
cut
off
a
wedge
and
*NL*
pressed
it
into
the
leather
pouch
of
his
cheek
.
``
Guess
he
's
been
in
*NL*
Starkfield
too
many
winters
.
Most
of
the
smart
ones
get
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
had
to
stay
and
care
for
the
folks
.
There
war
n't
ever
anybody
*NL*
but
Ethan
.
Fust
his
father
--
then
his
mother
--
then
his
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
the
smash-up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harmon
chuckled
sardonically
.
``
That
's
so
.
He
had
to
stay
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
And
since
then
they
've
had
to
care
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harmon
thoughtfully
passed
his
tobacco
to
the
other
cheek
.
``
Oh
,
as
to
*NL*
that
:
I
guess
it
's
always
Ethan
done
the
caring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Harmon
Gow
developed
the
tale
as
far
as
his
mental
and
moral
*NL*
reach
permitted
there
were
perceptible
gaps
between
his
facts
,
and
I
had
*NL*
the
sense
that
the
deeper
meaning
of
the
story
was
in
the
gaps
.
But
*NL*
one
phrase
stuck
in
my
memory
and
served
as
the
nucleus
about
which
I
*NL*
grouped
my
subsequent
inferences
:
``
Guess
he
's
been
in
Starkfield
too
*NL*
many
winters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
my
own
time
there
was
up
I
had
learned
to
know
what
that
meant
.
*NL*
Yet
I
had
come
in
the
degenerate
day
of
trolley
,
bicycle
and
rural
*NL*
delivery
,
when
communication
was
easy
between
the
scattered
mountain
*NL*
villages
,
and
the
bigger
towns
in
the
valleys
,
such
as
Bettsbridge
and
*NL*
Shadd
's
Falls
,
had
libraries
,
theatres
and
Y.
M.
C.
A.
halls
to
which
*NL*
the
youth
of
the
hills
could
descend
for
recreation
.
But
when
winter
*NL*
shut
down
on
Starkfield
and
the
village
lay
under
a
sheet
of
snow
*NL*
perpetually
renewed
from
the
pale
skies
,
I
began
to
see
what
life
*NL*
there
--
or
rather
its
negation
--
must
have
been
in
Ethan
Frome
's
young
*NL*
manhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
sent
up
by
my
employers
on
a
job
connected
with
the
big
*NL*
power-house
at
Corbury
Junction
,
and
a
long-drawn
carpenters
'
strike
*NL*
had
so
delayed
the
work
that
I
found
myself
anchored
at
Starkfield
--
the
*NL*
nearest
habitable
spot
--
for
the
best
part
of
the
winter
.
I
chafed
at
*NL*
first
,
and
then
,
under
the
hypnotising
effect
of
routine
,
gradually
*NL*
began
to
find
a
grim
satisfaction
in
the
life
.
During
the
early
part
of
*NL*
my
stay
I
had
been
struck
by
the
contrast
between
the
vitality
of
*NL*
the
climate
and
the
deadness
of
the
community
.
Day
by
day
,
after
the
*NL*
December
snows
were
over
,
a
blazing
blue
sky
poured
down
torrents
*NL*
of
light
and
air
on
the
white
landscape
,
which
gave
them
back
in
an
*NL*
intenser
glitter
.
One
would
have
supposed
that
such
an
atmosphere
must
*NL*
quicken
the
emotions
as
well
as
the
blood
;
but
it
seemed
to
produce
*NL*
no
change
except
that
of
retarding
still
more
the
sluggish
pulse
of
*NL*
Starkfield
.
When
I
had
been
there
a
little
longer
,
and
had
seen
this
*NL*
phase
of
crystal
clearness
followed
by
long
stretches
of
sunless
cold
;
*NL*
when
the
storms
of
February
had
pitched
their
white
tents
about
the
*NL*
devoted
village
and
the
wild
cavalry
of
March
winds
had
charged
down
to
*NL*
their
support
;
I
began
to
understand
why
Starkfield
emerged
from
its
*NL*
six
months
'
siege
like
a
starved
garrison
capitulating
without
quarter
.
*NL*
Twenty
years
earlier
the
means
of
resistance
must
have
been
far
fewer
,
*NL*
and
the
enemy
in
command
of
almost
all
the
lines
of
access
between
the
*NL*
beleaguered
villages
;
and
,
considering
these
things
,
I
felt
the
sinister
*NL*
force
of
Harmon
's
phrase
:
``
Most
of
the
smart
ones
get
away
.
''
But
if
that
*NL*
were
the
case
,
how
could
any
combination
of
obstacles
have
hindered
the
*NL*
flight
of
a
man
like
Ethan
Frome
?
*NL*
*NL*
During
my
stay
at
Starkfield
I
lodged
with
a
middle-aged
widow
*NL*
colloquially
known
as
Mrs.
Ned
Hale
.
Mrs.
Hale
's
father
had
been
the
*NL*
village
lawyer
of
the
previous
generation
,
and
``
lawyer
Varnum
's
house
,
''
*NL*
where
my
landlady
still
lived
with
her
mother
,
was
the
most
considerable
*NL*
mansion
in
the
village
.
It
stood
at
one
end
of
the
main
street
,
its
*NL*
classic
portico
and
small-paned
windows
looking
down
a
flagged
path
*NL*
between
Norway
spruces
to
the
slim
white
steeple
of
the
Congregational
*NL*
church
.
It
was
clear
that
the
Varnum
fortunes
were
at
the
ebb
,
but
the
*NL*
two
women
did
what
they
could
to
preserve
a
decent
dignity
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Hale
,
in
particular
,
had
a
certain
wan
refinement
not
out
of
keeping
*NL*
with
her
pale
old-fashioned
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
``
best
parlour
,
''
with
its
black
horse-hair
and
mahogany
weakly
*NL*
illuminated
by
a
gurgling
Carcel
lamp
,
I
listened
every
evening
to
*NL*
another
and
more
delicately
shaded
version
of
the
Starkfield
chronicle
.
*NL*
It
was
not
that
Mrs.
Ned
Hale
felt
,
or
affected
,
any
social
superiority
*NL*
to
the
people
about
her
;
it
was
only
that
the
accident
of
a
finer
*NL*
sensibility
and
a
little
more
education
had
put
just
enough
distance
*NL*
between
herself
and
her
neighbours
to
enable
her
to
judge
them
with
*NL*
detachment
.
She
was
not
unwilling
to
exercise
this
faculty
,
and
I
had
*NL*
great
hopes
of
getting
from
her
the
missing
facts
of
Ethan
Frome
's
*NL*
story
,
or
rather
such
a
key
to
his
character
as
should
co-ordinate
the
*NL*
facts
I
knew
.
Her
mind
was
a
store-house
of
innocuous
anecdote
and
any
*NL*
question
about
her
acquaintances
brought
forth
a
volume
of
detail
;
but
*NL*
on
the
subject
of
Ethan
Frome
I
found
her
unexpectedly
reticent
.
There
*NL*
was
no
hint
of
disapproval
in
her
reserve
;
I
merely
felt
in
her
an
*NL*
insurmountable
reluctance
to
speak
of
him
or
his
affairs
,
a
low
``
Yes
,
I
*NL*
knew
them
both
...
it
was
awful
...
''
seeming
to
be
the
utmost
concession
*NL*
that
her
distress
could
make
to
my
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
marked
was
the
change
in
her
manner
,
such
depths
of
sad
initiation
*NL*
did
it
imply
,
that
,
with
some
doubts
as
to
my
delicacy
,
I
put
the
case
*NL*
anew
to
my
village
oracle
,
Harmon
Gow
;
but
got
for
my
pains
only
an
*NL*
uncomprehending
grunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ruth
Varnum
was
always
as
nervous
as
a
rat
;
and
,
come
to
think
of
it
,
*NL*
she
was
the
first
one
to
see
'em
after
they
was
picked
up
.
It
happened
*NL*
right
below
lawyer
Varnum
's
,
down
at
the
bend
of
the
Corbury
road
,
just
*NL*
round
about
the
time
that
Ruth
got
engaged
to
Ned
Hale
.
The
young
folks
*NL*
was
all
friends
,
and
I
guess
she
just
ca
n't
bear
to
talk
about
it
.
She
's
*NL*
had
troubles
enough
of
her
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
dwellers
in
Starkfield
,
as
in
more
notable
communities
,
had
had
*NL*
troubles
enough
of
their
own
to
make
them
comparatively
indifferent
to
*NL*
those
of
their
neighbours
;
and
though
all
conceded
that
Ethan
Frome
's
*NL*
had
been
beyond
the
common
measure
,
no
one
gave
me
an
explanation
of
the
*NL*
look
in
his
face
which
,
as
I
persisted
in
thinking
,
neither
poverty
*NL*
nor
physical
suffering
could
have
put
there
.
Nevertheless
,
I
might
have
*NL*
contented
myself
with
the
story
pieced
together
from
these
hints
had
*NL*
it
not
been
for
the
provocation
of
Mrs.
Hale
's
silence
,
and
--
a
little
*NL*
later
--
for
the
accident
of
personal
contact
with
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
my
arrival
at
Starkfield
,
Denis
Eady
,
the
rich
Irish
grocer
,
who
was
*NL*
the
proprietor
of
Starkfield
's
nearest
approach
to
a
livery
stable
,
had
*NL*
entered
into
an
agreement
to
send
me
over
daily
to
Corbury
Flats
,
where
*NL*
I
had
to
pick
up
my
train
for
the
Junction
.
But
about
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
winter
Eady
's
horses
fell
ill
of
a
local
epidemic
.
The
illness
spread
*NL*
to
the
other
Starkfield
stables
and
for
a
day
or
two
I
was
put
to
it
to
*NL*
find
a
means
of
transport
.
Then
Harmon
Gow
suggested
that
Ethan
Frome
's
*NL*
bay
was
still
on
his
legs
and
that
his
owner
might
be
glad
to
drive
me
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stared
at
the
suggestion
.
``
Ethan
Frome
?
But
I
've
never
even
spoken
to
*NL*
him
.
Why
on
earth
should
he
put
himself
out
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harmon
's
answer
surprised
me
still
more
.
``
I
do
n't
know
as
he
would
;
but
*NL*
I
know
he
would
n't
be
sorry
to
earn
a
dollar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
told
that
Frome
was
poor
,
and
that
the
saw-mill
and
the
arid
*NL*
acres
of
his
farm
yielded
scarcely
enough
to
keep
his
household
through
*NL*
the
winter
;
but
I
had
not
supposed
him
to
be
in
such
want
as
Harmon
's
*NL*
words
implied
,
and
I
expressed
my
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
matters
ai
n't
gone
any
too
well
with
him
,
''
Harmon
said
.
``
When
a
*NL*
man
's
been
setting
round
like
a
hulk
for
twenty
years
or
more
,
seeing
*NL*
things
that
want
doing
,
it
eats
inter
him
,
and
he
loses
his
grit
.
That
*NL*
Frome
farm
was
always
`
bout
as
bare
's
a
milkpan
when
the
cat
's
been
*NL*
round
;
and
you
know
what
one
of
them
old
water-mills
is
wuth
nowadays
.
*NL*
When
Ethan
could
sweat
over
'em
both
from
sunup
to
dark
he
kinder
choked
*NL*
a
living
out
of
'em
;
but
his
folks
ate
up
most
everything
,
even
then
,
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
see
how
he
makes
out
now
.
Fust
his
father
got
a
kick
,
out
*NL*
haying
,
and
went
soft
in
the
brain
,
and
gave
away
money
like
Bible
texts
*NL*
afore
he
died
.
Then
his
mother
got
queer
and
dragged
along
for
years
as
*NL*
weak
as
a
baby
;
and
his
wife
Zeena
,
she
's
always
been
the
greatest
hand
*NL*
at
doctoring
in
the
county
.
Sickness
and
trouble
:
that
's
what
Ethan
's
*NL*
had
his
plate
full
up
with
,
ever
since
the
very
first
helping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
when
I
looked
out
,
I
saw
the
hollow-backed
bay
between
*NL*
the
Varnum
spruces
,
and
Ethan
Frome
,
throwing
back
his
worn
bearskin
,
*NL*
made
room
for
me
in
the
sleigh
at
his
side
.
After
that
,
for
a
week
,
he
*NL*
drove
me
over
every
morning
to
Corbury
Flats
,
and
on
my
return
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
met
me
again
and
carried
me
back
through
the
icy
night
to
*NL*
Starkfield
.
The
distance
each
way
was
barely
three
miles
,
but
the
old
*NL*
bay
's
pace
was
slow
,
and
even
with
firm
snow
under
the
runners
we
were
*NL*
nearly
an
hour
on
the
way
.
Ethan
Frome
drove
in
silence
,
the
reins
*NL*
loosely
held
in
his
left
hand
,
his
brown
seamed
profile
,
under
the
*NL*
helmet-like
peak
of
the
cap
,
relieved
against
the
banks
of
snow
like
the
*NL*
bronze
image
of
a
hero
.
He
never
turned
his
face
to
mine
,
or
*NL*
answered
,
except
in
monosyllables
,
the
questions
I
put
,
or
such
slight
*NL*
pleasantries
as
I
ventured
.
He
seemed
a
part
of
the
mute
melancholy
*NL*
landscape
,
an
incarnation
of
its
frozen
woe
,
with
all
that
was
warm
*NL*
and
sentient
in
him
fast
bound
below
the
surface
;
but
there
was
nothing
*NL*
unfriendly
in
his
silence
.
I
simply
felt
that
he
lived
in
a
depth
of
*NL*
moral
isolation
too
remote
for
casual
access
,
and
I
had
the
sense
that
*NL*
his
loneliness
was
not
merely
the
result
of
his
personal
plight
,
tragic
*NL*
as
I
guessed
that
to
be
,
but
had
in
it
,
as
Harmon
Gow
had
hinted
,
the
*NL*
profound
accumulated
cold
of
many
Starkfield
winters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
once
or
twice
was
the
distance
between
us
bridged
for
a
moment
;
*NL*
and
the
glimpses
thus
gained
confirmed
my
desire
to
know
more
.
Once
I
*NL*
happened
to
speak
of
an
engineering
job
I
had
been
on
the
previous
year
*NL*
in
Florida
,
and
of
the
contrast
between
the
winter
landscape
about
us
*NL*
and
that
in
which
I
had
found
myself
the
year
before
;
and
to
my
surprise
*NL*
Frome
said
suddenly
:
``
Yes
:
I
was
down
there
once
,
and
for
a
good
while
*NL*
afterward
I
could
call
up
the
sight
of
it
in
winter
.
But
now
it
's
all
*NL*
snowed
under
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
no
more
,
and
I
had
to
guess
the
rest
from
the
inflection
of
his
*NL*
voice
and
his
sharp
relapse
into
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
day
,
on
getting
into
my
train
at
the
Flats
,
I
missed
a
volume
*NL*
of
popular
science
--
I
think
it
was
on
some
recent
discoveries
in
*NL*
bio-chemistry
--
which
I
had
carried
with
me
to
read
on
the
way
.
I
thought
*NL*
no
more
about
it
till
I
got
into
the
sleigh
again
that
evening
,
and
saw
*NL*
the
book
in
Frome
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
it
after
you
were
gone
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
the
volume
into
my
pocket
and
we
dropped
back
into
our
usual
*NL*
silence
;
but
as
we
began
to
crawl
up
the
long
hill
from
Corbury
Flats
to
*NL*
the
Starkfield
ridge
I
became
aware
in
the
dusk
that
he
had
turned
his
*NL*
face
to
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
things
in
that
book
that
I
did
n't
know
the
first
word
about
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
less
at
his
words
than
at
the
queer
note
of
resentment
in
*NL*
his
voice
.
He
was
evidently
surprised
and
slightly
aggrieved
at
his
own
*NL*
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
that
sort
of
thing
interest
you
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
used
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
one
or
two
rather
new
things
in
the
book
:
there
have
been
*NL*
some
big
strides
lately
in
that
particular
line
of
research
.
''
I
waited
*NL*
a
moment
for
an
answer
that
did
not
come
;
then
I
said
:
``
If
you
'd
like
to
*NL*
look
the
book
through
I
'd
be
glad
to
leave
it
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
,
and
I
had
the
impression
that
he
felt
himself
about
to
*NL*
yield
to
a
stealing
tide
of
inertia
;
then
,
``
Thank
you
--
I
'll
take
it
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hoped
that
this
incident
might
set
up
some
more
direct
communication
*NL*
between
us
.
Frome
was
so
simple
and
straightforward
that
I
was
sure
his
*NL*
curiosity
about
the
book
was
based
on
a
genuine
interest
in
its
subject
.
*NL*
Such
tastes
and
acquirements
in
a
man
of
his
condition
made
the
contrast
*NL*
more
poignant
between
his
outer
situation
and
his
inner
needs
,
and
I
*NL*
hoped
that
the
chance
of
giving
expression
to
the
latter
might
at
least
*NL*
unseal
his
lips
.
But
something
in
his
past
history
,
or
in
his
present
*NL*
way
of
living
,
had
apparently
driven
him
too
deeply
into
himself
for
any
*NL*
casual
impulse
to
draw
him
back
to
his
kind
.
At
our
next
meeting
he
made
*NL*
no
allusion
to
the
book
,
and
our
intercourse
seemed
fated
to
remain
as
*NL*
negative
and
one-sided
as
if
there
had
been
no
break
in
his
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frome
had
been
driving
me
over
to
the
Flats
for
about
a
week
when
one
*NL*
morning
I
looked
out
of
my
window
into
a
thick
snow-fall
.
The
height
of
*NL*
the
white
waves
massed
against
the
garden-fence
and
along
the
wall
of
*NL*
the
church
showed
that
the
storm
must
have
been
going
on
all
night
,
*NL*
and
that
the
drifts
were
likely
to
be
heavy
in
the
open
.
I
thought
*NL*
it
probable
that
my
train
would
be
delayed
;
but
I
had
to
be
at
the
*NL*
power-house
for
an
hour
or
two
that
afternoon
,
and
I
decided
,
if
Frome
*NL*
turned
up
,
to
push
through
to
the
Flats
and
wait
there
till
my
train
*NL*
came
in
.
I
do
n't
know
why
I
put
it
in
the
conditional
,
however
,
for
I
*NL*
never
doubted
that
Frome
would
appear
.
He
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
be
*NL*
turned
from
his
business
by
any
commotion
of
the
elements
;
and
at
*NL*
the
appointed
hour
his
sleigh
glided
up
through
the
snow
like
a
*NL*
stage-apparition
behind
thickening
veils
of
gauze
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
getting
to
know
him
too
well
to
express
either
wonder
or
gratitude
*NL*
at
his
keeping
his
appointment
;
but
I
exclaimed
in
surprise
as
I
saw
him
*NL*
turn
his
horse
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
of
the
Corbury
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
railroad
's
blocked
by
a
freight-train
that
got
stuck
in
a
drift
*NL*
below
the
Flats
,
''
he
explained
,
as
we
jogged
off
into
the
stinging
*NL*
whiteness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
look
here
--
where
are
you
taking
me
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Straight
to
the
Junction
,
by
the
shortest
way
,
''
he
answered
,
pointing
*NL*
up
School
House
Hill
with
his
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Junction
--
in
this
storm
?
Why
,
it
's
a
good
ten
miles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bay
'll
do
it
if
you
give
him
time
.
You
said
you
had
some
business
*NL*
there
this
afternoon
.
I
'll
see
you
get
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
so
quietly
that
I
could
only
answer
:
``
You
're
doing
me
the
*NL*
biggest
kind
of
a
favour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
he
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Abreast
of
the
schoolhouse
the
road
forked
,
and
we
dipped
down
a
lane
*NL*
to
the
left
,
between
hemlock
boughs
bent
inward
to
their
trunks
by
the
*NL*
weight
of
the
snow
.
I
had
often
walked
that
way
on
Sundays
,
and
knew
*NL*
that
the
solitary
roof
showing
through
bare
branches
near
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
hill
was
that
of
Frome
's
saw-mill
.
It
looked
exanimate
enough
,
with
*NL*
its
idle
wheel
looming
above
the
black
stream
dashed
with
yellow-white
*NL*
spume
,
and
its
cluster
of
sheds
sagging
under
their
white
load
.
Frome
*NL*
did
not
even
turn
his
head
as
we
drove
by
,
and
still
in
silence
we
began
*NL*
to
mount
the
next
slope
.
About
a
mile
farther
,
on
a
road
I
had
never
*NL*
travelled
,
we
came
to
an
orchard
of
starved
apple-trees
writhing
over
*NL*
a
hillside
among
outcroppings
of
slate
that
nuzzled
up
through
the
snow
*NL*
like
animals
pushing
out
their
noses
to
breathe
.
Beyond
the
orchard
*NL*
lay
a
field
or
two
,
their
boundaries
lost
under
drifts
;
and
above
the
*NL*
fields
,
huddled
against
the
white
immensities
of
land
and
sky
,
one
of
*NL*
those
lonely
New
England
farm-houses
that
make
the
landscape
lonelier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
my
place
,
''
said
Frome
,
with
a
sideway
jerk
of
his
lame
elbow
;
*NL*
and
in
the
distress
and
oppression
of
the
scene
I
did
not
know
what
to
*NL*
answer
.
The
snow
had
ceased
,
and
a
flash
of
watery
sunlight
exposed
the
*NL*
house
on
the
slope
above
us
in
all
its
plaintive
ugliness
.
The
black
*NL*
wraith
of
a
deciduous
creeper
flapped
from
the
porch
,
and
the
thin
*NL*
wooden
walls
,
under
their
worn
coat
of
paint
,
seemed
to
shiver
in
the
*NL*
wind
that
had
risen
with
the
ceasing
of
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
was
bigger
in
my
father
's
time
:
I
had
to
take
down
the
`
L
,
'
*NL*
a
while
back
,
''
Frome
continued
,
checking
with
a
twitch
of
the
left
rein
*NL*
the
bay
's
evident
intention
of
turning
in
through
the
broken-down
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
then
that
the
unusually
forlorn
and
stunted
look
of
the
house
was
*NL*
partly
due
to
the
loss
of
what
is
known
in
New
England
as
the
``
L
''
:
*NL*
that
long
deep-roofed
adjunct
usually
built
at
right
angles
to
the
main
*NL*
house
,
and
connecting
it
,
by
way
of
storerooms
and
tool-house
,
with
the
*NL*
wood-shed
and
cow-barn
.
Whether
because
of
its
symbolic
sense
,
the
image
*NL*
it
presents
of
a
life
linked
with
the
soil
,
and
enclosing
in
itself
the
*NL*
chief
sources
of
warmth
and
nourishment
,
or
whether
merely
because
*NL*
of
the
consolatory
thought
that
it
enables
the
dwellers
in
that
harsh
*NL*
climate
to
get
to
their
morning
's
work
without
facing
the
weather
,
it
*NL*
is
certain
that
the
``
L
''
rather
than
the
house
itself
seems
to
be
the
*NL*
centre
,
the
actual
hearth-stone
of
the
New
England
farm
.
Perhaps
this
*NL*
connection
of
ideas
,
which
had
often
occurred
to
me
in
my
rambles
about
*NL*
Starkfield
,
caused
me
to
hear
a
wistful
note
in
Frome
's
words
,
and
to
*NL*
see
in
the
diminished
dwelling
the
image
of
his
own
shrunken
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
kinder
side-tracked
here
now
,
''
he
added
,
``
but
there
was
*NL*
considerable
passing
before
the
railroad
was
carried
through
to
the
*NL*
Flats
.
''
He
roused
the
lagging
bay
with
another
twitch
;
then
,
as
if
the
*NL*
mere
sight
of
the
house
had
let
me
too
deeply
into
his
confidence
for
*NL*
any
farther
pretence
of
reserve
,
he
went
on
slowly
:
``
I
've
always
set
*NL*
down
the
worst
of
mother
's
trouble
to
that
.
When
she
got
the
rheumatism
*NL*
so
bad
she
could
n't
move
around
she
used
to
sit
up
there
and
watch
the
*NL*
road
by
the
hour
;
and
one
year
,
when
they
was
six
months
mending
the
*NL*
Bettsbridge
pike
after
the
floods
,
and
Harmon
Gow
had
to
bring
his
stage
*NL*
round
this
way
,
she
picked
up
so
that
she
used
to
get
down
to
the
gate
*NL*
most
days
to
see
him
.
But
after
the
trains
begun
running
nobody
ever
*NL*
come
by
here
to
speak
of
,
and
mother
never
could
get
it
through
her
head
*NL*
what
had
happened
,
and
it
preyed
on
her
right
along
till
she
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
turned
into
the
Corbury
road
the
snow
began
to
fall
again
,
cutting
*NL*
off
our
last
glimpse
of
the
house
;
and
Frome
's
silence
fell
with
it
,
*NL*
letting
down
between
us
the
old
veil
of
reticence
.
This
time
the
wind
*NL*
did
not
cease
with
the
return
of
the
snow
.
Instead
,
it
sprang
up
to
*NL*
a
gale
which
now
and
then
,
from
a
tattered
sky
,
flung
pale
sweeps
of
*NL*
sunlight
over
a
landscape
chaotically
tossed
.
But
the
bay
was
as
good
*NL*
as
Frome
's
word
,
and
we
pushed
on
to
the
Junction
through
the
wild
white
*NL*
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
the
storm
held
off
,
and
the
clearness
in
the
west
*NL*
seemed
to
my
inexperienced
eye
the
pledge
of
a
fair
evening
.
I
finished
*NL*
my
business
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
we
set
out
for
Starkfield
with
*NL*
a
good
chance
of
getting
there
for
supper
.
But
at
sunset
the
clouds
*NL*
gathered
again
,
bringing
an
earlier
night
,
and
the
snow
began
to
fall
*NL*
straight
and
steadily
from
a
sky
without
wind
,
in
a
soft
universal
*NL*
diffusion
more
confusing
than
the
gusts
and
eddies
of
the
morning
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
the
thickening
darkness
,
to
be
the
winter
night
*NL*
itself
descending
on
us
layer
by
layer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
ray
of
Frome
's
lantern
was
soon
lost
in
this
smothering
*NL*
medium
,
in
which
even
his
sense
of
direction
,
and
the
bay
's
homing
*NL*
instinct
,
finally
ceased
to
serve
us
.
Two
or
three
times
some
ghostly
*NL*
landmark
sprang
up
to
warn
us
that
we
were
astray
,
and
then
was
sucked
*NL*
back
into
the
mist
;
and
when
we
finally
regained
our
road
the
old
horse
*NL*
began
to
show
signs
of
exhaustion
.
I
felt
myself
to
blame
for
having
*NL*
accepted
Frome
's
offer
,
and
after
a
short
discussion
I
persuaded
him
*NL*
to
let
me
get
out
of
the
sleigh
and
walk
along
through
the
snow
at
the
*NL*
bay
's
side
.
In
this
way
we
struggled
on
for
another
mile
or
two
,
and
*NL*
at
last
reached
a
point
where
Frome
,
peering
into
what
seemed
to
me
*NL*
formless
night
,
said
:
``
That
's
my
gate
down
yonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
stretch
had
been
the
hardest
part
of
the
way
.
The
bitter
cold
*NL*
and
the
heavy
going
had
nearly
knocked
the
wind
out
of
me
,
and
I
could
*NL*
feel
the
horse
's
side
ticking
like
a
clock
under
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Frome
,
''
I
began
,
``
there
's
no
earthly
use
in
your
going
any
*NL*
farther
--
''
but
he
interrupted
me
:
``
Nor
you
neither
.
There
's
been
about
*NL*
enough
of
this
for
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
understood
that
he
was
offering
me
a
night
's
shelter
at
the
farm
,
and
*NL*
without
answering
I
turned
into
the
gate
at
his
side
,
and
followed
him
*NL*
to
the
barn
,
where
I
helped
him
to
unharness
and
bed
down
the
tired
*NL*
horse
.
When
this
was
done
he
unhooked
the
lantern
from
the
sleigh
,
*NL*
stepped
out
again
into
the
night
,
and
called
to
me
over
his
shoulder
:
*NL*
``
This
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Far
off
above
us
a
square
of
light
trembled
through
the
screen
of
snow
.
*NL*
Staggering
along
in
Frome
's
wake
I
floundered
toward
it
,
and
in
the
*NL*
darkness
almost
fell
into
one
of
the
deep
drifts
against
the
front
of
*NL*
the
house
.
Frome
scrambled
up
the
slippery
steps
of
the
porch
,
digging
*NL*
a
way
through
the
snow
with
his
heavily
booted
foot
.
Then
he
lifted
his
*NL*
lantern
,
found
the
latch
,
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
.
I
went
*NL*
after
him
into
a
low
unlit
passage
,
at
the
back
of
which
a
ladder-like
*NL*
staircase
rose
into
obscurity
.
On
our
right
a
line
of
light
marked
the
*NL*
door
of
the
room
which
had
sent
its
ray
across
the
night
;
and
behind
the
*NL*
door
I
heard
a
woman
's
voice
droning
querulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frome
stamped
on
the
worn
oil-cloth
to
shake
the
snow
from
his
boots
,
*NL*
and
set
down
his
lantern
on
a
kitchen
chair
which
was
the
only
piece
of
*NL*
furniture
in
the
hall
.
Then
he
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
he
said
;
and
as
he
spoke
the
droning
voice
grew
still
...
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
that
night
that
I
found
the
clue
to
Ethan
Frome
,
and
began
to
put
*NL*
together
this
vision
of
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
village
lay
under
two
feet
of
snow
,
with
drifts
at
the
windy
*NL*
corners
.
In
a
sky
of
iron
the
points
of
the
Dipper
hung
like
icicles
*NL*
and
Orion
flashed
his
cold
fires
.
The
moon
had
set
,
but
the
night
was
*NL*
so
transparent
that
the
white
house-fronts
between
the
elms
looked
gray
*NL*
against
the
snow
,
clumps
of
bushes
made
black
stains
on
it
,
and
the
*NL*
basement
windows
of
the
church
sent
shafts
of
yellow
light
far
across
*NL*
the
endless
undulations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Ethan
Frome
walked
at
a
quick
pace
along
the
deserted
street
,
past
*NL*
the
bank
and
Michael
Eady
's
new
brick
store
and
Lawyer
Varnum
's
house
*NL*
with
the
two
black
Norway
spruces
at
the
gate
.
Opposite
the
Varnum
gate
,
*NL*
where
the
road
fell
away
toward
the
Corbury
valley
,
the
church
reared
*NL*
its
slim
white
steeple
and
narrow
peristyle
.
As
the
young
man
walked
*NL*
toward
it
the
upper
windows
drew
a
black
arcade
along
the
side
wall
of
*NL*
the
building
,
but
from
the
lower
openings
,
on
the
side
where
the
ground
*NL*
sloped
steeply
down
to
the
Corbury
road
,
the
light
shot
its
long
bars
,
*NL*
illuminating
many
fresh
furrows
in
the
track
leading
to
the
basement
*NL*
door
,
and
showing
,
under
an
adjoining
shed
,
a
line
of
sleighs
with
*NL*
heavily
blanketed
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
perfectly
still
,
and
the
air
so
dry
and
pure
that
it
gave
*NL*
little
sensation
of
cold
.
The
effect
produced
on
Frome
was
rather
of
*NL*
a
complete
absence
of
atmosphere
,
as
though
nothing
less
tenuous
than
*NL*
ether
intervened
between
the
white
earth
under
his
feet
and
the
metallic
*NL*
dome
overhead
.
``
It
's
like
being
in
an
exhausted
receiver
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
Four
or
five
years
earlier
he
had
taken
a
year
's
course
at
a
*NL*
technological
college
at
Worcester
,
and
dabbled
in
the
laboratory
with
*NL*
a
friendly
professor
of
physics
;
and
the
images
supplied
by
that
*NL*
experience
still
cropped
up
,
at
unexpected
moments
,
through
the
totally
*NL*
different
associations
of
thought
in
which
he
had
since
been
living
.
His
*NL*
father
's
death
,
and
the
misfortunes
following
it
,
had
put
a
premature
*NL*
end
to
Ethan
's
studies
;
but
though
they
had
not
gone
far
enough
to
be
*NL*
of
much
practical
use
they
had
fed
his
fancy
and
made
him
aware
of
huge
*NL*
cloudy
meanings
behind
the
daily
face
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
strode
along
through
the
snow
the
sense
of
such
meanings
glowed
in
*NL*
his
brain
and
mingled
with
the
bodily
flush
produced
by
his
sharp
tramp
.
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
village
he
paused
before
the
darkened
front
of
the
*NL*
church
.
He
stood
there
a
moment
,
breathing
quickly
,
and
looking
up
and
*NL*
down
the
street
,
in
which
not
another
figure
moved
.
The
pitch
of
*NL*
the
Corbury
road
,
below
lawyer
Varnum
's
spruces
,
was
the
favourite
*NL*
coasting-ground
of
Starkfield
,
and
on
clear
evenings
the
church
corner
*NL*
rang
till
late
with
the
shouts
of
the
coasters
;
but
to-night
not
a
sled
*NL*
darkened
the
whiteness
of
the
long
declivity
.
The
hush
of
midnight
lay
*NL*
on
the
village
,
and
all
its
waking
life
was
gathered
behind
the
church
*NL*
windows
,
from
which
strains
of
dance-music
flowed
with
the
broad
bands
*NL*
of
yellow
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
skirting
the
side
of
the
building
,
went
down
the
slope
*NL*
toward
the
basement
door
.
To
keep
out
of
range
of
the
revealing
rays
*NL*
from
within
he
made
a
circuit
through
the
untrodden
snow
and
gradually
*NL*
approached
the
farther
angle
of
the
basement
wall
.
Thence
,
still
hugging
*NL*
the
shadow
,
he
edged
his
way
cautiously
forward
to
the
nearest
window
,
*NL*
holding
back
his
straight
spare
body
and
craning
his
neck
till
he
got
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seen
thus
,
from
the
pure
and
frosty
darkness
in
which
he
stood
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
be
seething
in
a
mist
of
heat
.
The
metal
reflectors
of
the
*NL*
gas-jets
sent
crude
waves
of
light
against
the
whitewashed
walls
,
and
*NL*
the
iron
flanks
of
the
stove
at
the
end
of
the
hall
looked
as
though
*NL*
they
were
heaving
with
volcanic
fires
.
The
floor
was
thronged
with
*NL*
girls
and
young
men
.
Down
the
side
wall
facing
the
window
stood
a
row
of
*NL*
kitchen
chairs
from
which
the
older
women
had
just
risen
.
By
this
time
*NL*
the
music
had
stopped
,
and
the
musicians
--
a
fiddler
,
and
the
young
lady
*NL*
who
played
the
harmonium
on
Sundays
--
were
hastily
refreshing
themselves
*NL*
at
one
corner
of
the
supper-table
which
aligned
its
devastated
*NL*
pie-dishes
and
ice-cream
saucers
on
the
platform
at
the
end
of
the
hall
.
*NL*
The
guests
were
preparing
to
leave
,
and
the
tide
had
already
set
toward
*NL*
the
passage
where
coats
and
wraps
were
hung
,
when
a
young
man
with
a
*NL*
sprightly
foot
and
a
shock
of
black
hair
shot
into
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
floor
and
clapped
his
hands
.
The
signal
took
instant
effect
.
*NL*
The
musicians
hurried
to
their
instruments
,
the
dancers
--
some
already
*NL*
half-muffled
for
departure
--
fell
into
line
down
each
side
of
the
room
,
*NL*
the
older
spectators
slipped
back
to
their
chairs
,
and
the
lively
young
*NL*
man
,
after
diving
about
here
and
there
in
the
throng
,
drew
forth
a
girl
*NL*
who
had
already
wound
a
cherry-coloured
``
fascinator
''
about
her
head
,
*NL*
and
,
leading
her
up
to
the
end
of
the
floor
,
whirled
her
down
its
length
*NL*
to
the
bounding
tune
of
a
Virginia
reel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frome
's
heart
was
beating
fast
.
He
had
been
straining
for
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
the
dark
head
under
the
cherry-coloured
scarf
and
it
vexed
him
that
*NL*
another
eye
should
have
been
quicker
than
his
.
The
leader
of
the
reel
,
*NL*
who
looked
as
if
he
had
Irish
blood
in
his
veins
,
danced
well
,
and
his
*NL*
partner
caught
his
fire
.
As
she
passed
down
the
line
,
her
light
figure
*NL*
swinging
from
hand
to
hand
in
circles
of
increasing
swiftness
,
the
scarf
*NL*
flew
off
her
head
and
stood
out
behind
her
shoulders
,
and
Frome
,
at
each
*NL*
turn
,
caught
sight
of
her
laughing
panting
lips
,
the
cloud
of
dark
hair
*NL*
about
her
forehead
,
and
the
dark
eyes
which
seemed
the
only
fixed
points
*NL*
in
a
maze
of
flying
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dancers
were
going
faster
and
faster
,
and
the
musicians
,
to
keep
*NL*
up
with
them
,
belaboured
their
instruments
like
jockeys
lashing
their
*NL*
mounts
on
the
home-stretch
;
yet
it
seemed
to
the
young
man
at
the
window
*NL*
that
the
reel
would
never
end
.
Now
and
then
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
*NL*
girl
's
face
to
that
of
her
partner
,
which
,
in
the
exhilaration
of
the
*NL*
dance
,
had
taken
on
a
look
of
almost
impudent
ownership
.
Denis
Eady
was
*NL*
the
son
of
Michael
Eady
,
the
ambitious
Irish
grocer
,
whose
suppleness
*NL*
and
effrontery
had
given
Starkfield
its
first
notion
of
``
smart
''
business
*NL*
methods
,
and
whose
new
brick
store
testified
to
the
success
of
the
*NL*
attempt
.
His
son
seemed
likely
to
follow
in
his
steps
,
and
was
meanwhile
*NL*
applying
the
same
arts
to
the
conquest
of
the
Starkfield
maidenhood
.
*NL*
Hitherto
Ethan
Frome
had
been
content
to
think
him
a
mean
fellow
;
but
*NL*
now
he
positively
invited
a
horse-whipping
.
It
was
strange
that
the
*NL*
girl
did
not
seem
aware
of
it
:
that
she
could
lift
her
rapt
face
to
her
*NL*
dancer
's
,
and
drop
her
hands
into
his
,
without
appearing
to
feel
the
*NL*
offence
of
his
look
and
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frome
was
in
the
habit
of
walking
into
Starkfield
to
fetch
home
his
*NL*
wife
's
cousin
,
Mattie
Silver
,
on
the
rare
evenings
when
some
chance
of
*NL*
amusement
drew
her
to
the
village
.
It
was
his
wife
who
had
suggested
,
*NL*
when
the
girl
came
to
live
with
them
,
that
such
opportunities
should
be
*NL*
put
in
her
way
.
Mattie
Silver
came
from
Stamford
,
and
when
she
entered
*NL*
the
Fromes
'
household
to
act
as
her
cousin
Zeena
's
aid
it
was
thought
*NL*
best
,
as
she
came
without
pay
,
not
to
let
her
feel
too
sharp
a
contrast
*NL*
between
the
life
she
had
left
and
the
isolation
of
a
Starkfield
farm
.
*NL*
But
for
this
--
as
Frome
sardonically
reflected
--
it
would
hardly
have
*NL*
occurred
to
Zeena
to
take
any
thought
for
the
girl
's
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
wife
first
proposed
that
they
should
give
Mattie
an
occasional
*NL*
evening
out
he
had
inwardly
demurred
at
having
to
do
the
extra
two
miles
*NL*
to
the
village
and
back
after
his
hard
day
on
the
farm
;
but
not
long
*NL*
afterward
he
had
reached
the
point
of
wishing
that
Starkfield
might
give
*NL*
all
its
nights
to
revelry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
Silver
had
lived
under
his
roof
for
a
year
,
and
from
early
*NL*
morning
till
they
met
at
supper
he
had
frequent
chances
of
seeing
her
;
*NL*
but
no
moments
in
her
company
were
comparable
to
those
when
,
her
arm
in
*NL*
his
,
and
her
light
step
flying
to
keep
time
with
his
long
stride
,
they
*NL*
walked
back
through
the
night
to
the
farm
.
He
had
taken
to
the
girl
from
*NL*
the
first
day
,
when
he
had
driven
over
to
the
Flats
to
meet
her
,
and
*NL*
she
had
smiled
and
waved
to
him
from
the
train
,
crying
out
,
``
You
must
be
*NL*
Ethan
!
''
as
she
jumped
down
with
her
bundles
,
while
he
reflected
,
looking
*NL*
over
her
slight
person
:
``
She
do
n't
look
much
on
housework
,
but
she
ai
n't
*NL*
a
fretter
,
anyhow
.
''
But
it
was
not
only
that
the
coming
to
his
house
of
*NL*
a
bit
of
hopeful
young
life
was
like
the
lighting
of
a
fire
on
a
cold
*NL*
hearth
.
The
girl
was
more
than
the
bright
serviceable
creature
he
had
*NL*
thought
her
.
She
had
an
eye
to
see
and
an
ear
to
hear
:
he
could
show
her
*NL*
things
and
tell
her
things
,
and
taste
the
bliss
of
feeling
that
all
he
*NL*
imparted
left
long
reverberations
and
echoes
he
could
wake
at
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
their
night
walks
back
to
the
farm
that
he
felt
most
*NL*
intensely
the
sweetness
of
this
communion
.
He
had
always
been
more
*NL*
sensitive
than
the
people
about
him
to
the
appeal
of
natural
beauty
.
His
*NL*
unfinished
studies
had
given
form
to
this
sensibility
and
even
in
his
*NL*
unhappiest
moments
field
and
sky
spoke
to
him
with
a
deep
and
powerful
*NL*
persuasion
.
But
hitherto
the
emotion
had
remained
in
him
as
a
silent
*NL*
ache
,
veiling
with
sadness
the
beauty
that
evoked
it
.
He
did
not
even
*NL*
know
whether
any
one
else
in
the
world
felt
as
he
did
,
or
whether
he
*NL*
was
the
sole
victim
of
this
mournful
privilege
.
Then
he
learned
that
*NL*
one
other
spirit
had
trembled
with
the
same
touch
of
wonder
:
that
at
his
*NL*
side
,
living
under
his
roof
and
eating
his
bread
,
was
a
creature
to
whom
*NL*
he
could
say
:
``
That
's
Orion
down
yonder
;
the
big
fellow
to
the
right
is
*NL*
Aldebaran
,
and
the
bunch
of
little
ones
--
like
bees
swarming
--
they
're
the
*NL*
Pleiades
...
''
or
whom
he
could
hold
entranced
before
a
ledge
of
granite
*NL*
thrusting
up
through
the
fern
while
he
unrolled
the
huge
panorama
of
the
*NL*
ice
age
,
and
the
long
dim
stretches
of
succeeding
time
.
The
fact
that
*NL*
admiration
for
his
learning
mingled
with
Mattie
's
wonder
at
what
he
*NL*
taught
was
not
the
least
part
of
his
pleasure
.
And
there
were
other
*NL*
sensations
,
less
definable
but
more
exquisite
,
which
drew
them
together
*NL*
with
a
shock
of
silent
joy
:
the
cold
red
of
sunset
behind
winter
*NL*
hills
,
the
flight
of
cloud-flocks
over
slopes
of
golden
stubble
,
or
the
*NL*
intensely
blue
shadows
of
hemlocks
on
sunlit
snow
.
When
she
said
to
him
*NL*
once
:
``
It
looks
just
as
if
it
was
painted
!
''
it
seemed
to
Ethan
that
the
*NL*
art
of
definition
could
go
no
farther
,
and
that
words
had
at
last
been
*NL*
found
to
utter
his
secret
soul
...
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
stood
in
the
darkness
outside
the
church
these
memories
came
back
*NL*
with
the
poignancy
of
vanished
things
.
Watching
Mattie
whirl
down
the
*NL*
floor
from
hand
to
hand
he
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
thought
*NL*
that
his
dull
talk
interested
her
.
To
him
,
who
was
never
gay
but
in
her
*NL*
presence
,
her
gaiety
seemed
plain
proof
of
indifference
.
The
face
she
*NL*
lifted
to
her
dancers
was
the
same
which
,
when
she
saw
him
,
always
*NL*
looked
like
a
window
that
has
caught
the
sunset
.
He
even
noticed
two
or
*NL*
three
gestures
which
,
in
his
fatuity
,
he
had
thought
she
kept
for
him
:
*NL*
a
way
of
throwing
her
head
back
when
she
was
amused
,
as
if
to
taste
her
*NL*
laugh
before
she
let
it
out
,
and
a
trick
of
sinking
her
lids
slowly
when
*NL*
anything
charmed
or
moved
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
made
him
unhappy
,
and
his
unhappiness
roused
his
latent
fears
.
*NL*
His
wife
had
never
shown
any
jealousy
of
Mattie
,
but
of
late
she
had
*NL*
grumbled
increasingly
over
the
house-work
and
found
oblique
ways
of
*NL*
attracting
attention
to
the
girl
's
inefficiency
.
Zeena
had
always
been
*NL*
what
Starkfield
called
``
sickly
,
''
and
Frome
had
to
admit
that
,
if
she
*NL*
were
as
ailing
as
she
believed
,
she
needed
the
help
of
a
stronger
arm
*NL*
than
the
one
which
lay
so
lightly
in
his
during
the
night
walks
to
the
*NL*
farm
.
Mattie
had
no
natural
turn
for
housekeeping
,
and
her
training
had
*NL*
done
nothing
to
remedy
the
defect
.
She
was
quick
to
learn
,
but
forgetful
*NL*
and
dreamy
,
and
not
disposed
to
take
the
matter
seriously
.
Ethan
had
*NL*
an
idea
that
if
she
were
to
marry
a
man
she
was
fond
of
the
dormant
*NL*
instinct
would
wake
,
and
her
pies
and
biscuits
become
the
pride
of
the
*NL*
county
;
but
domesticity
in
the
abstract
did
not
interest
her
.
At
first
*NL*
she
was
so
awkward
that
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
her
;
but
she
*NL*
laughed
with
him
and
that
made
them
better
friends
.
He
did
his
best
to
*NL*
supplement
her
unskilled
efforts
,
getting
up
earlier
than
usual
to
light
*NL*
the
kitchen
fire
,
carrying
in
the
wood
overnight
,
and
neglecting
the
*NL*
mill
for
the
farm
that
he
might
help
her
about
the
house
during
the
day
.
*NL*
He
even
crept
down
on
Saturday
nights
to
scrub
the
kitchen
floor
after
*NL*
the
women
had
gone
to
bed
;
and
Zeena
,
one
day
,
had
surprised
him
at
the
*NL*
churn
and
had
turned
away
silently
,
with
one
of
her
queer
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
late
there
had
been
other
signs
of
her
disfavour
,
as
intangible
but
*NL*
more
disquieting
.
One
cold
winter
morning
,
as
he
dressed
in
the
dark
,
*NL*
his
candle
flickering
in
the
draught
of
the
ill-fitting
window
,
he
had
*NL*
heard
her
speak
from
the
bed
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
do
n't
want
I
should
be
left
without
anybody
to
do
for
me
,
''
*NL*
she
said
in
her
flat
whine
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
supposed
her
to
be
asleep
,
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
had
*NL*
startled
him
,
though
she
was
given
to
abrupt
explosions
of
speech
after
*NL*
long
intervals
of
secretive
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
and
looked
at
her
where
she
lay
indistinctly
outlined
under
*NL*
the
dark
calico
quilt
,
her
high-boned
face
taking
a
grayish
tinge
from
*NL*
the
whiteness
of
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
to
do
for
you
?
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
say
you
ca
n't
afford
a
hired
girl
when
Mattie
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frome
turned
away
again
,
and
taking
up
his
razor
stooped
to
catch
the
*NL*
reflection
of
his
stretched
cheek
in
the
blotched
looking-glass
above
*NL*
the
wash-stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
on
earth
should
Mattie
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
she
gets
married
,
I
mean
,
''
his
wife
's
drawl
came
from
behind
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
'd
never
leave
us
as
long
as
you
needed
her
,
''
he
returned
,
*NL*
scraping
hard
at
his
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
ever
have
it
said
that
I
stood
in
the
way
of
a
poor
girl
*NL*
like
Mattie
marrying
a
smart
fellow
like
Denis
Eady
,
''
Zeena
answered
in
*NL*
a
tone
of
plaintive
self-effacement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
,
glaring
at
his
face
in
the
glass
,
threw
his
head
back
to
draw
*NL*
the
razor
from
ear
to
chin
.
His
hand
was
steady
,
but
the
attitude
was
an
*NL*
excuse
for
not
making
an
immediate
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
doctor
do
n't
want
I
should
be
left
without
anybody
,
''
Zeena
*NL*
continued
.
``
He
wanted
I
should
speak
to
you
about
a
girl
he
's
heard
*NL*
about
,
that
might
come
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
laid
down
the
razor
and
straightened
himself
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Denis
Eady
!
If
that
's
all
,
I
guess
there
's
no
such
hurry
to
look
round
*NL*
for
a
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
it
,
''
said
Zeena
obstinately
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
getting
into
his
clothes
in
fumbling
haste
.
``
All
right
.
But
I
*NL*
have
n't
got
the
time
now
;
I
'm
late
as
it
is
,
''
he
returned
,
holding
his
*NL*
old
silver
turnip-watch
to
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
,
apparently
accepting
this
as
final
,
lay
watching
him
in
silence
*NL*
while
he
pulled
his
suspenders
over
his
shoulders
and
jerked
his
arms
*NL*
into
his
coat
;
but
as
he
went
toward
the
door
she
said
,
suddenly
and
*NL*
incisively
:
``
I
guess
you
're
always
late
,
now
you
shave
every
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
thrust
had
frightened
him
more
than
any
vague
insinuations
about
*NL*
Denis
Eady
.
It
was
a
fact
that
since
Mattie
Silver
's
coming
he
had
taken
*NL*
to
shaving
every
day
;
but
his
wife
always
seemed
to
be
asleep
when
he
*NL*
left
her
side
in
the
winter
darkness
,
and
he
had
stupidly
assumed
that
*NL*
she
would
not
notice
any
change
in
his
appearance
.
Once
or
twice
in
the
*NL*
past
he
had
been
faintly
disquieted
by
Zenobia
's
way
of
letting
things
*NL*
happen
without
seeming
to
remark
them
,
and
then
,
weeks
afterward
,
in
*NL*
a
casual
phrase
,
revealing
that
she
had
all
along
taken
her
notes
and
*NL*
drawn
her
inferences
.
Of
late
,
however
,
there
had
been
no
room
in
his
*NL*
thoughts
for
such
vague
apprehensions
.
Zeena
herself
,
from
an
oppressive
*NL*
reality
,
had
faded
into
an
insubstantial
shade
.
All
his
life
was
lived
*NL*
in
the
sight
and
sound
of
Mattie
Silver
,
and
he
could
no
longer
conceive
*NL*
of
its
being
otherwise
.
But
now
,
as
he
stood
outside
the
church
,
and
saw
*NL*
Mattie
spinning
down
the
floor
with
Denis
Eady
,
a
throng
of
disregarded
*NL*
hints
and
menaces
wove
their
cloud
about
his
brain
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
dancers
poured
out
of
the
hall
Frome
,
drawing
back
behind
the
*NL*
projecting
storm-door
,
watched
the
segregation
of
the
grotesquely
*NL*
muffled
groups
,
in
which
a
moving
lantern
ray
now
and
then
lit
up
a
*NL*
face
flushed
with
food
and
dancing
.
The
villagers
,
being
afoot
,
were
*NL*
the
first
to
climb
the
slope
to
the
main
street
,
while
the
country
*NL*
neighbours
packed
themselves
more
slowly
into
the
sleighs
under
the
*NL*
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
you
riding
,
Mattie
?
''
a
woman
's
voice
called
back
from
the
throng
*NL*
about
the
shed
,
and
Ethan
's
heart
gave
a
jump
.
From
where
he
stood
he
*NL*
could
not
see
the
persons
coming
out
of
the
hall
till
they
had
advanced
*NL*
a
few
steps
beyond
the
wooden
sides
of
the
storm-door
;
but
through
its
*NL*
cracks
he
heard
a
clear
voice
answer
:
``
Mercy
no
!
Not
on
such
a
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
there
,
then
,
close
to
him
,
only
a
thin
board
between
.
In
another
*NL*
moment
she
would
step
forth
into
the
night
,
and
his
eyes
,
accustomed
*NL*
to
the
obscurity
,
would
discern
her
as
clearly
as
though
she
stood
in
*NL*
daylight
.
A
wave
of
shyness
pulled
him
back
into
the
dark
angle
of
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
he
stood
there
in
silence
instead
of
making
his
presence
known
*NL*
to
her
.
It
had
been
one
of
the
wonders
of
their
intercourse
that
from
*NL*
the
first
,
she
,
the
quicker
,
finer
,
more
expressive
,
instead
of
crushing
*NL*
him
by
the
contrast
,
had
given
him
something
of
her
own
ease
and
*NL*
freedom
;
but
now
he
felt
as
heavy
and
loutish
as
in
his
student
days
,
*NL*
when
he
had
tried
to
``
jolly
''
the
Worcester
girls
at
a
picnic
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hung
back
,
and
she
came
out
alone
and
paused
within
a
few
yards
of
*NL*
him
.
She
was
almost
the
last
to
leave
the
hall
,
and
she
stood
looking
*NL*
uncertainly
about
her
as
if
wondering
why
he
did
not
show
himself
.
*NL*
Then
a
man
's
figure
approached
,
coming
so
close
to
her
that
under
their
*NL*
formless
wrappings
they
seemed
merged
in
one
dim
outline
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentleman
friend
gone
back
on
you
?
Say
,
Matt
,
that
's
tough
!
No
,
I
*NL*
would
n't
be
mean
enough
to
tell
the
other
girls
.
I
ai
n't
as
low-down
as
*NL*
that
.
''
-LRB-
How
Frome
hated
his
cheap
banter
!
-RRB-
``
But
look
at
here
,
ai
n't
it
*NL*
lucky
I
got
the
old
man
's
cutter
down
there
waiting
for
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frome
heard
the
girl
's
voice
,
gaily
incredulous
:
``
What
on
earth
's
your
*NL*
father
's
cutter
doin
'
down
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
waiting
for
me
to
take
a
ride
.
I
got
the
roan
colt
too
.
I
kinder
*NL*
knew
I
'd
want
to
take
a
ride
to-night
,
''
Eady
,
in
his
triumph
,
tried
to
*NL*
put
a
sentimental
note
into
his
bragging
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
seemed
to
waver
,
and
Frome
saw
her
twirl
the
end
of
her
scarf
*NL*
irresolutely
about
her
fingers
.
Not
for
the
world
would
he
have
made
*NL*
a
sign
to
her
,
though
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
life
hung
on
her
next
*NL*
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
a
minute
while
I
unhitch
the
colt
,
''
Denis
called
to
her
,
*NL*
springing
toward
the
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
perfectly
still
,
looking
after
him
,
in
an
attitude
of
tranquil
*NL*
expectancy
torturing
to
the
hidden
watcher
.
Frome
noticed
that
she
no
*NL*
longer
turned
her
head
from
side
to
side
,
as
though
peering
through
the
*NL*
night
for
another
figure
.
She
let
Denis
Eady
lead
out
the
horse
,
climb
*NL*
into
the
cutter
and
fling
back
the
bearskin
to
make
room
for
her
at
his
*NL*
side
;
then
,
with
a
swift
motion
of
flight
,
she
turned
about
and
darted
*NL*
up
the
slope
toward
the
front
of
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
!
Hope
you
'll
have
a
lovely
ride
!
''
she
called
back
to
him
over
*NL*
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denis
laughed
,
and
gave
the
horse
a
cut
that
brought
him
quickly
abreast
*NL*
of
her
retreating
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
!
Get
in
quick
!
It
's
as
slippery
as
thunder
on
this
turn
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
,
leaning
over
to
reach
out
a
hand
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
back
at
him
:
``
Good-night
!
I
'm
not
getting
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
they
had
passed
beyond
Frome
's
earshot
and
he
could
only
*NL*
follow
the
shadowy
pantomime
of
their
silhouettes
as
they
continued
*NL*
to
move
along
the
crest
of
the
slope
above
him
.
He
saw
Eady
,
after
a
*NL*
moment
,
jump
from
the
cutter
and
go
toward
the
girl
with
the
reins
over
*NL*
one
arm
.
The
other
he
tried
to
slip
through
hers
;
but
she
eluded
him
*NL*
nimbly
,
and
Frome
's
heart
,
which
had
swung
out
over
a
black
void
,
*NL*
trembled
back
to
safety
.
A
moment
later
he
heard
the
jingle
of
departing
*NL*
sleigh
bells
and
discerned
a
figure
advancing
alone
toward
the
empty
*NL*
expanse
of
snow
before
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
black
shade
of
the
Varnum
spruces
he
caught
up
with
her
and
she
*NL*
turned
with
a
quick
``
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
I
'd
forgotten
you
,
Matt
?
''
he
asked
with
sheepish
glee
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
seriously
:
``
I
thought
maybe
you
could
n't
come
back
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
?
What
on
earth
could
stop
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
Zeena
was
n't
feeling
any
too
good
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
's
in
bed
long
ago
.
''
He
paused
,
a
question
struggling
in
him
.
*NL*
``
Then
you
meant
to
walk
home
all
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ai
n't
afraid
!
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
together
in
the
gloom
of
the
spruces
,
an
empty
world
*NL*
glimmering
about
them
wide
and
grey
under
the
stars
.
He
brought
his
*NL*
question
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
thought
I
had
n't
come
,
why
did
n't
you
ride
back
with
Denis
*NL*
Eady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
were
you
?
How
did
you
know
?
I
never
saw
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
wonder
and
his
laughter
ran
together
like
spring
rills
in
a
thaw
.
*NL*
Ethan
had
the
sense
of
having
done
something
arch
and
ingenious
.
To
*NL*
prolong
the
effect
he
groped
for
a
dazzling
phrase
,
and
brought
out
,
in
*NL*
a
growl
of
rapture
:
``
Come
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slipped
an
arm
through
hers
,
as
Eady
had
done
,
and
fancied
it
was
*NL*
faintly
pressed
against
her
side
,
but
neither
of
them
moved
.
It
was
so
*NL*
dark
under
the
spruces
that
he
could
barely
see
the
shape
of
her
head
*NL*
beside
his
shoulder
.
He
longed
to
stoop
his
cheek
and
rub
it
against
*NL*
her
scarf
.
He
would
have
liked
to
stand
there
with
her
all
night
in
the
*NL*
blackness
.
She
moved
forward
a
step
or
two
and
then
paused
again
above
*NL*
the
dip
of
the
Corbury
road
.
Its
icy
slope
,
scored
by
innumerable
*NL*
runners
,
looked
like
a
mirror
scratched
by
travellers
at
an
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
whole
lot
of
them
coasting
before
the
moon
set
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
come
in
and
coast
with
them
some
night
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
would
you
,
Ethan
?
It
would
be
lovely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
come
to-morrow
if
there
's
a
moon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lingered
,
pressing
closer
to
his
side
.
``
Ned
Hale
and
Ruth
Varnum
*NL*
came
just
as
near
running
into
the
big
elm
at
the
bottom
.
We
were
all
*NL*
sure
they
were
killed
.
''
Her
shiver
ran
down
his
arm
.
``
Would
n't
it
have
*NL*
been
too
awful
?
They
're
so
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Ned
ai
n't
much
at
steering
.
I
guess
I
can
take
you
down
all
right
!
''
*NL*
he
said
disdainfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
aware
that
he
was
``
talking
big
,
''
like
Denis
Eady
;
but
his
*NL*
reaction
of
joy
had
unsteadied
him
,
and
the
inflection
with
which
she
*NL*
had
said
of
the
engaged
couple
``
They
're
so
happy
!
''
made
the
words
sound
*NL*
as
if
she
had
been
thinking
of
herself
and
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
elm
is
dangerous
,
though
.
It
ought
to
be
cut
down
,
''
she
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
be
afraid
of
it
,
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
I
ai
n't
the
kind
to
be
afraid
''
she
tossed
back
,
almost
*NL*
indifferently
;
and
suddenly
she
began
to
walk
on
with
a
rapid
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
alterations
of
mood
were
the
despair
and
joy
of
Ethan
Frome
.
The
*NL*
motions
of
her
mind
were
as
incalculable
as
the
flit
of
a
bird
in
the
*NL*
branches
.
The
fact
that
he
had
no
right
to
show
his
feelings
,
and
thus
*NL*
provoke
the
expression
of
hers
,
made
him
attach
a
fantastic
importance
*NL*
to
every
change
in
her
look
and
tone
.
Now
he
thought
she
understood
him
,
*NL*
and
feared
;
now
he
was
sure
she
did
not
,
and
despaired
.
To-night
the
*NL*
pressure
of
accumulated
misgivings
sent
the
scale
drooping
toward
*NL*
despair
,
and
her
indifference
was
the
more
chilling
after
the
flush
of
*NL*
joy
into
which
she
had
plunged
him
by
dismissing
Denis
Eady
.
He
mounted
*NL*
School
House
Hill
at
her
side
and
walked
on
in
silence
till
they
*NL*
reached
the
lane
leading
to
the
saw-mill
;
then
the
need
of
some
definite
*NL*
assurance
grew
too
strong
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
have
found
me
right
off
if
you
had
n't
gone
back
to
have
that
last
*NL*
reel
with
Denis
,
''
he
brought
out
awkwardly
.
He
could
not
pronounce
the
*NL*
name
without
a
stiffening
of
the
muscles
of
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Ethan
,
how
could
I
tell
you
were
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
what
folks
say
is
true
,
''
he
jerked
out
at
her
,
instead
of
*NL*
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
short
,
and
he
felt
,
in
the
darkness
,
that
her
face
was
*NL*
lifted
quickly
to
his
.
``
Why
,
what
do
folks
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
natural
enough
you
should
be
leaving
us
''
he
floundered
on
,
*NL*
following
his
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
they
say
?
''
she
mocked
back
at
him
;
then
,
with
a
sudden
*NL*
drop
of
her
sweet
treble
:
``
You
mean
that
Zeena
--
ai
n't
suited
with
me
any
*NL*
more
?
''
she
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
arms
had
slipped
apart
and
they
stood
motionless
,
each
seeking
to
*NL*
distinguish
the
other
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
ai
n't
anything
like
as
smart
as
I
ought
to
be
,
''
she
went
on
,
*NL*
while
he
vainly
struggled
for
expression
.
``
There
's
lots
of
things
a
*NL*
hired
girl
could
do
that
come
awkward
to
me
still
--
and
I
have
n't
got
much
*NL*
strength
in
my
arms
.
But
if
she
'd
only
tell
me
I
'd
try
.
You
know
she
*NL*
hardly
ever
says
anything
,
and
sometimes
I
can
see
she
ai
n't
suited
,
*NL*
and
yet
I
do
n't
know
why
.
''
She
turned
on
him
with
a
sudden
flash
of
*NL*
indignation
.
``
You
'd
ought
to
tell
me
,
Ethan
Frome
--
you
'd
ought
to
!
Unless
*NL*
you
want
me
to
go
too
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Unless
he
wanted
her
to
go
too
!
The
cry
was
balm
to
his
raw
wound
.
The
*NL*
iron
heavens
seemed
to
melt
and
rain
down
sweetness
.
Again
he
struggled
*NL*
for
the
all-expressive
word
,
and
again
,
his
arm
in
hers
,
found
only
a
*NL*
deep
``
Come
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
in
silence
through
the
blackness
of
the
hemlock-shaded
*NL*
lane
,
where
Ethan
's
sawmill
gloomed
through
the
night
,
and
out
again
*NL*
into
the
comparative
clearness
of
the
fields
.
On
the
farther
side
of
the
*NL*
hemlock
belt
the
open
country
rolled
away
before
them
grey
and
lonely
*NL*
under
the
stars
.
Sometimes
their
way
led
them
under
the
shade
of
an
*NL*
overhanging
bank
or
through
the
thin
obscurity
of
a
clump
of
leafless
*NL*
trees
.
Here
and
there
a
farmhouse
stood
far
back
among
the
fields
,
mute
*NL*
and
cold
as
a
grave-stone
.
The
night
was
so
still
that
they
heard
the
*NL*
frozen
snow
crackle
under
their
feet
.
The
crash
of
a
loaded
branch
*NL*
falling
far
off
in
the
woods
reverberated
like
a
musket-shot
,
and
once
a
*NL*
fox
barked
,
and
Mattie
shrank
closer
to
Ethan
,
and
quickened
her
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
they
sighted
the
group
of
larches
at
Ethan
's
gate
,
and
as
they
*NL*
drew
near
it
the
sense
that
the
walk
was
over
brought
back
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
n't
want
to
leave
us
,
Matt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
stoop
his
head
to
catch
her
stifled
whisper
:
``
Where
'd
I
go
,
if
*NL*
I
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
sent
a
pang
through
him
but
the
tone
suffused
him
with
joy
.
*NL*
He
forgot
what
else
he
had
meant
to
say
and
pressed
her
against
him
so
*NL*
closely
that
he
seemed
to
feel
her
warmth
in
his
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ai
n't
crying
are
you
,
Matt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
of
course
I
'm
not
,
''
she
quavered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
passed
under
the
shaded
knoll
where
,
*NL*
enclosed
in
a
low
fence
,
the
Frome
grave-stones
slanted
at
crazy
angles
*NL*
through
the
snow
.
Ethan
looked
at
them
curiously
.
For
years
that
quiet
*NL*
company
had
mocked
his
restlessness
,
his
desire
for
change
and
freedom
.
*NL*
``
We
never
got
away
--
how
should
you
?
''
seemed
to
be
written
on
every
*NL*
headstone
;
and
whenever
he
went
in
or
out
of
his
gate
he
thought
with
a
*NL*
shiver
:
``
I
shall
just
go
on
living
here
till
I
join
them
.
''
But
now
all
*NL*
desire
for
change
had
vanished
,
and
the
sight
of
the
little
enclosure
*NL*
gave
him
a
warm
sense
of
continuance
and
stability
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
we
'll
never
let
you
go
,
Matt
,
''
he
whispered
,
as
though
even
the
*NL*
dead
,
lovers
once
,
must
conspire
with
him
to
keep
her
;
and
brushing
by
*NL*
the
graves
,
he
thought
:
``
We
'll
always
go
on
living
here
together
,
and
*NL*
some
day
she
'll
lie
there
beside
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
let
the
vision
possess
him
as
they
climbed
the
hill
to
the
house
.
*NL*
He
was
never
so
happy
with
her
as
when
he
abandoned
himself
to
these
*NL*
dreams
.
Half-way
up
the
slope
Mattie
stumbled
against
some
unseen
*NL*
obstruction
and
clutched
his
sleeve
to
steady
herself
.
The
wave
of
*NL*
warmth
that
went
through
him
was
like
the
prolongation
of
his
vision
.
*NL*
For
the
first
time
he
stole
his
arm
about
her
,
and
she
did
not
resist
.
*NL*
They
walked
on
as
if
they
were
floating
on
a
summer
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
always
went
to
bed
as
soon
as
she
had
had
her
supper
,
and
the
*NL*
shutterless
windows
of
the
house
were
dark
.
A
dead
cucumber-vine
dangled
*NL*
from
the
porch
like
the
crape
streamer
tied
to
the
door
for
a
death
,
and
*NL*
the
thought
flashed
through
Ethan
's
brain
:
``
If
it
was
there
for
Zeena
--
''
*NL*
Then
he
had
a
distinct
sight
of
his
wife
lying
in
their
bedroom
asleep
,
*NL*
her
mouth
slightly
open
,
her
false
teeth
in
a
tumbler
by
the
bed
...
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
around
to
the
back
of
the
house
,
between
the
rigid
*NL*
gooseberry
bushes
.
It
was
Zeena
's
habit
,
when
they
came
back
late
from
*NL*
the
village
,
to
leave
the
key
of
the
kitchen
door
under
the
mat
.
Ethan
*NL*
stood
before
the
door
,
his
head
heavy
with
dreams
,
his
arm
still
about
*NL*
Mattie
.
``
Matt
--
''
he
began
,
not
knowing
what
he
meant
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slipped
out
of
his
hold
without
speaking
,
and
he
stooped
down
and
*NL*
felt
for
the
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
there
!
''
he
said
,
straightening
himself
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
strained
their
eyes
at
each
other
through
the
icy
darkness
.
Such
a
*NL*
thing
had
never
happened
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
she
's
forgotten
it
,
''
Mattie
said
in
a
tremulous
whisper
;
but
both
*NL*
of
them
knew
that
it
was
not
like
Zeena
to
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
have
fallen
off
into
the
snow
,
''
Mattie
continued
,
after
a
*NL*
pause
during
which
they
had
stood
intently
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
have
been
pushed
off
,
then
,
''
he
rejoined
in
the
same
tone
.
*NL*
Another
wild
thought
tore
through
him
.
What
if
tramps
had
been
*NL*
there
--
what
if
...
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
listened
,
fancying
he
heard
a
distant
sound
in
the
house
;
then
*NL*
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
a
match
,
and
kneeling
down
,
passed
its
light
*NL*
slowly
over
the
rough
edges
of
snow
about
the
doorstep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
kneeling
when
his
eyes
,
on
a
level
with
the
lower
panel
of
*NL*
the
door
,
caught
a
faint
ray
beneath
it
.
Who
could
be
stirring
in
that
*NL*
silent
house
?
He
heard
a
step
on
the
stairs
,
and
again
for
an
instant
*NL*
the
thought
of
tramps
tore
through
him
.
Then
the
door
opened
and
he
saw
*NL*
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Against
the
dark
background
of
the
kitchen
she
stood
up
tall
and
*NL*
angular
,
one
hand
drawing
a
quilted
counterpane
to
her
flat
breast
,
*NL*
while
the
other
held
a
lamp
.
The
light
,
on
a
level
with
her
chin
,
drew
*NL*
out
of
the
darkness
her
puckered
throat
and
the
projecting
wrist
of
the
*NL*
hand
that
clutched
the
quilt
,
and
deepened
fantastically
the
hollows
and
*NL*
prominences
of
her
high-boned
face
under
its
ring
of
crimping-pins
.
To
*NL*
Ethan
,
still
in
the
rosy
haze
of
his
hour
with
Mattie
,
the
sight
came
*NL*
with
the
intense
precision
of
the
last
dream
before
waking
.
He
felt
as
*NL*
if
he
had
never
before
known
what
his
wife
looked
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
aside
without
speaking
,
and
Mattie
and
Ethan
passed
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
which
had
the
deadly
chill
of
a
vault
after
the
dry
cold
of
the
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guess
you
forgot
about
us
,
Zeena
,
''
Ethan
joked
,
stamping
the
snow
from
*NL*
his
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
just
felt
so
mean
I
could
n't
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
came
forward
,
unwinding
her
wraps
,
the
colour
of
the
cherry
scarf
*NL*
in
her
fresh
lips
and
cheeks
.
``
I
'm
so
sorry
,
Zeena
!
Is
n't
there
anything
*NL*
I
can
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
there
's
nothing
.
''
Zeena
turned
away
from
her
.
``
You
might
`
a
'
shook
*NL*
off
that
snow
outside
,
''
she
said
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
out
of
the
kitchen
ahead
of
them
and
pausing
in
the
hall
*NL*
raised
the
lamp
at
arm
's
-
length
,
as
if
to
light
them
up
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
paused
also
,
affecting
to
fumble
for
the
peg
on
which
he
hung
his
*NL*
coat
and
cap
.
The
doors
of
the
two
bedrooms
faced
each
other
across
the
*NL*
narrow
upper
landing
,
and
to-night
it
was
peculiarly
repugnant
to
him
*NL*
that
Mattie
should
see
him
follow
Zeena
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
I
wo
n't
come
up
yet
awhile
,
''
he
said
,
turning
as
if
to
go
back
*NL*
to
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
stopped
short
and
looked
at
him
.
``
For
the
land
's
sake
--
what
you
*NL*
going
to
do
down
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
the
mill
accounts
to
go
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
to
stare
at
him
,
the
flame
of
the
unshaded
lamp
bringing
*NL*
out
with
microscopic
cruelty
the
fretful
lines
of
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
time
o
'
night
?
You
'll
ketch
your
death
.
The
fire
's
out
long
*NL*
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
answering
he
moved
away
toward
the
kitchen
.
As
he
did
so
his
*NL*
glance
crossed
Mattie
's
and
he
fancied
that
a
fugitive
warning
gleamed
*NL*
through
her
lashes
.
The
next
moment
they
sank
to
her
flushed
cheeks
and
*NL*
she
began
to
mount
the
stairs
ahead
of
Zeena
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
.
It
is
powerful
cold
down
here
,
''
Ethan
assented
;
and
with
*NL*
lowered
head
he
went
up
in
his
wife
's
wake
,
and
followed
her
across
the
*NL*
threshold
of
their
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
hauling
to
be
done
at
the
lower
end
of
the
wood-lot
,
and
*NL*
Ethan
was
out
early
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winter
morning
was
as
clear
as
crystal
.
The
sunrise
burned
red
in
a
*NL*
pure
sky
,
the
shadows
on
the
rim
of
the
wood-lot
were
darkly
blue
,
and
*NL*
beyond
the
white
and
scintillating
fields
patches
of
far-off
forest
hung
*NL*
like
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
early
morning
stillness
,
when
his
muscles
were
swinging
*NL*
to
their
familiar
task
and
his
lungs
expanding
with
long
draughts
of
*NL*
mountain
air
,
that
Ethan
did
his
clearest
thinking
.
He
and
Zeena
had
not
*NL*
exchanged
a
word
after
the
door
of
their
room
had
closed
on
them
.
She
*NL*
had
measured
out
some
drops
from
a
medicine-bottle
on
a
chair
by
the
bed
*NL*
and
,
after
swallowing
them
,
and
wrapping
her
head
in
a
piece
of
yellow
*NL*
flannel
,
had
lain
down
with
her
face
turned
away
.
Ethan
undressed
*NL*
hurriedly
and
blew
out
the
light
so
that
he
should
not
see
her
when
he
*NL*
took
his
place
at
her
side
.
As
he
lay
there
he
could
hear
Mattie
moving
*NL*
about
in
her
room
,
and
her
candle
,
sending
its
small
ray
across
the
*NL*
landing
,
drew
a
scarcely
perceptible
line
of
light
under
his
door
.
He
*NL*
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
light
till
it
vanished
.
Then
the
room
grew
*NL*
perfectly
black
,
and
not
a
sound
was
audible
but
Zeena
's
asthmatic
*NL*
breathing
.
Ethan
felt
confusedly
that
there
were
many
things
he
ought
*NL*
to
think
about
,
but
through
his
tingling
veins
and
tired
brain
only
one
*NL*
sensation
throbbed
:
the
warmth
of
Mattie
's
shoulder
against
his
.
Why
had
*NL*
he
not
kissed
her
when
he
held
her
there
?
A
few
hours
earlier
he
would
*NL*
not
have
asked
himself
the
question
.
Even
a
few
minutes
earlier
,
when
*NL*
they
had
stood
alone
outside
the
house
,
he
would
not
have
dared
to
think
*NL*
of
kissing
her
.
But
since
he
had
seen
her
lips
in
the
lamplight
he
felt
*NL*
that
they
were
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
in
the
bright
morning
air
,
her
face
was
still
before
him
.
It
was
*NL*
part
of
the
sun
's
red
and
of
the
pure
glitter
on
the
snow
.
How
the
*NL*
girl
had
changed
since
she
had
come
to
Starkfield
!
He
remembered
what
a
*NL*
colourless
slip
of
a
thing
she
had
looked
the
day
he
had
met
her
at
the
*NL*
station
.
And
all
the
first
winter
,
how
she
had
shivered
with
cold
when
*NL*
the
northerly
gales
shook
the
thin
clapboards
and
the
snow
beat
like
*NL*
hail
against
the
loose-hung
windows
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
afraid
that
she
would
hate
the
hard
life
,
the
cold
and
*NL*
loneliness
;
but
not
a
sign
of
discontent
escaped
her
.
Zeena
took
the
*NL*
view
that
Mattie
was
bound
to
make
the
best
of
Starkfield
since
she
*NL*
had
n't
any
other
place
to
go
to
;
but
this
did
not
strike
Ethan
as
*NL*
conclusive
.
Zeena
,
at
any
rate
,
did
not
apply
the
principle
in
her
own
*NL*
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
all
the
more
sorry
for
the
girl
because
misfortune
had
,
in
*NL*
a
sense
,
indentured
her
to
them
.
Mattie
Silver
was
the
daughter
of
*NL*
a
cousin
of
Zenobia
Frome
's
,
who
had
inflamed
his
clan
with
mingled
*NL*
sentiments
of
envy
and
admiration
by
descending
from
the
hills
to
*NL*
Connecticut
,
where
he
had
married
a
Stamford
girl
and
succeeded
to
*NL*
her
father
's
thriving
``
drug
''
business
.
Unhappily
Orin
Silver
,
a
man
of
*NL*
far-reaching
aims
,
had
died
too
soon
to
prove
that
the
end
justifies
the
*NL*
means
.
His
accounts
revealed
merely
what
the
means
had
been
;
and
these
*NL*
were
such
that
it
was
fortunate
for
his
wife
and
daughter
that
his
books
*NL*
were
examined
only
after
his
impressive
funeral
.
His
wife
died
of
the
*NL*
disclosure
,
and
Mattie
,
at
twenty
,
was
left
alone
to
make
her
way
on
the
*NL*
fifty
dollars
obtained
from
the
sale
of
her
piano
.
For
this
purpose
her
*NL*
equipment
,
though
varied
,
was
inadequate
.
She
could
trim
a
hat
,
make
*NL*
molasses
candy
,
recite
``
Curfew
shall
not
ring
to-night
,
''
and
play
``
The
*NL*
Lost
Chord
''
and
a
pot-pourri
from
``
Carmen
.
''
When
she
tried
to
extend
the
*NL*
field
of
her
activities
in
the
direction
of
stenography
and
book-keeping
*NL*
her
health
broke
down
,
and
six
months
on
her
feet
behind
the
counter
of
*NL*
a
department
store
did
not
tend
to
restore
it
.
Her
nearest
relations
had
*NL*
been
induced
to
place
their
savings
in
her
father
's
hands
,
and
though
,
*NL*
after
his
death
,
they
ungrudgingly
acquitted
themselves
of
the
Christian
*NL*
duty
of
returning
good
for
evil
by
giving
his
daughter
all
the
advice
*NL*
at
their
disposal
,
they
could
hardly
be
expected
to
supplement
it
by
*NL*
material
aid
.
But
when
Zenobia
's
doctor
recommended
her
looking
about
*NL*
for
some
one
to
help
her
with
the
house-work
the
clan
instantly
saw
the
*NL*
chance
of
exacting
a
compensation
from
Mattie
.
Zenobia
,
though
doubtful
*NL*
of
the
girl
's
efficiency
,
was
tempted
by
the
freedom
to
find
fault
*NL*
without
much
risk
of
losing
her
;
and
so
Mattie
came
to
Starkfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zenobia
's
fault-finding
was
of
the
silent
kind
,
but
not
the
less
*NL*
penetrating
for
that
.
During
the
first
months
Ethan
alternately
burned
*NL*
with
the
desire
to
see
Mattie
defy
her
and
trembled
with
fear
of
the
*NL*
result
.
Then
the
situation
grew
less
strained
.
The
pure
air
,
and
the
*NL*
long
summer
hours
in
the
open
,
gave
back
life
and
elasticity
to
Mattie
,
*NL*
and
Zeena
,
with
more
leisure
to
devote
to
her
complex
ailments
,
grew
*NL*
less
watchful
of
the
girl
's
omissions
;
so
that
Ethan
,
struggling
on
*NL*
under
the
burden
of
his
barren
farm
and
failing
saw-mill
,
could
at
least
*NL*
imagine
that
peace
reigned
in
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
really
,
even
now
,
no
tangible
evidence
to
the
contrary
;
but
*NL*
since
the
previous
night
a
vague
dread
had
hung
on
his
sky-line
.
It
was
*NL*
formed
of
Zeena
's
obstinate
silence
,
of
Mattie
's
sudden
look
of
warning
,
*NL*
of
the
memory
of
just
such
fleeting
imperceptible
signs
as
those
which
*NL*
told
him
,
on
certain
stainless
mornings
,
that
before
night
there
would
*NL*
be
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
dread
was
so
strong
that
,
man-like
,
he
sought
to
postpone
certainty
.
*NL*
The
hauling
was
not
over
till
mid-day
,
and
as
the
lumber
was
to
be
*NL*
delivered
to
Andrew
Hale
,
the
Starkfield
builder
,
it
was
really
easier
*NL*
for
Ethan
to
send
Jotham
Powell
,
the
hired
man
,
back
to
the
farm
on
*NL*
foot
,
and
drive
the
load
down
to
the
village
himself
.
He
had
scrambled
*NL*
up
on
the
logs
,
and
was
sitting
astride
of
them
,
close
over
his
shaggy
*NL*
grays
,
when
,
coming
between
him
and
their
streaming
necks
,
he
had
a
*NL*
vision
of
the
warning
look
that
Mattie
had
given
him
the
night
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
's
going
to
be
any
trouble
I
want
to
be
there
,
''
was
his
vague
*NL*
reflection
,
as
he
threw
to
Jotham
the
unexpected
order
to
unhitch
the
*NL*
team
and
lead
them
back
to
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
slow
trudge
home
through
the
heavy
fields
,
and
when
the
two
*NL*
men
entered
the
kitchen
Mattie
was
lifting
the
coffee
from
the
stove
and
*NL*
Zeena
was
already
at
the
table
.
Her
husband
stopped
short
at
sight
of
*NL*
her
.
Instead
of
her
usual
calico
wrapper
and
knitted
shawl
she
wore
her
*NL*
best
dress
of
brown
merino
,
and
above
her
thin
strands
of
hair
,
which
*NL*
still
preserved
the
tight
undulations
of
the
crimping-pins
,
rose
a
hard
*NL*
perpendicular
bonnet
,
as
to
which
Ethan
's
clearest
notion
was
that
he
*NL*
had
to
pay
five
dollars
for
it
at
the
Bettsbridge
Emporium
.
On
the
floor
*NL*
beside
her
stood
his
old
valise
and
a
bandbox
wrapped
in
newspapers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
are
you
going
,
Zeena
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
my
shooting
pains
so
bad
that
I
'm
going
over
to
Bettsbridge
*NL*
to
spend
the
night
with
Aunt
Martha
Pierce
and
see
that
new
doctor
,
''
she
*NL*
answered
in
a
matter-of-fact
tone
,
as
if
she
had
said
she
was
going
into
*NL*
the
store-room
to
take
a
look
at
the
preserves
,
or
up
to
the
attic
to
go
*NL*
over
the
blankets
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
her
sedentary
habits
such
abrupt
decisions
were
not
without
*NL*
precedent
in
Zeena
's
history
.
Twice
or
thrice
before
she
had
suddenly
*NL*
packed
Ethan
's
valise
and
started
off
to
Bettsbridge
,
or
even
*NL*
Springfield
,
to
seek
the
advice
of
some
new
doctor
,
and
her
husband
had
*NL*
grown
to
dread
these
expeditions
because
of
their
cost
.
Zeena
always
*NL*
came
back
laden
with
expensive
remedies
,
and
her
last
visit
to
*NL*
Springfield
had
been
commemorated
by
her
paying
twenty
dollars
for
an
*NL*
electric
battery
of
which
she
had
never
been
able
to
learn
the
use
.
But
*NL*
for
the
moment
his
sense
of
relief
was
so
great
as
to
preclude
all
other
*NL*
feelings
.
He
had
now
no
doubt
that
Zeena
had
spoken
the
truth
in
saying
,
*NL*
the
night
before
,
that
she
had
sat
up
because
she
felt
``
too
mean
''
to
*NL*
sleep
:
her
abrupt
resolve
to
seek
medical
advice
showed
that
,
as
usual
,
*NL*
she
was
wholly
absorbed
in
her
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
expecting
a
protest
,
she
continued
plaintively
;
``
If
you
're
too
*NL*
busy
with
the
hauling
I
presume
you
can
let
Jotham
Powell
drive
me
over
*NL*
with
the
sorrel
in
time
to
ketch
the
train
at
the
Flats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
hardly
heard
what
she
was
saying
.
During
the
winter
months
*NL*
there
was
no
stage
between
Starkfield
and
Bettsbridge
,
and
the
trains
*NL*
which
stopped
at
Corbury
Flats
were
slow
and
infrequent
.
A
rapid
*NL*
calculation
showed
Ethan
that
Zeena
could
not
be
back
at
the
farm
before
*NL*
the
following
evening
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
'd
supposed
you
'd
`
a
'
made
any
objection
to
Jotham
Powell
's
driving
*NL*
me
over
--
''
she
began
again
,
as
though
his
silence
had
implied
refusal
.
On
*NL*
the
brink
of
departure
she
was
always
seized
with
a
flux
of
words
.
``
All
*NL*
I
know
is
,
''
she
continued
,
``
I
ca
n't
go
on
the
way
I
am
much
longer
.
*NL*
The
pains
are
clear
away
down
to
my
ankles
now
,
or
I
'd
`
a
'
walked
in
to
*NL*
Starkfield
on
my
own
feet
,
sooner
'n
put
you
out
,
and
asked
Michael
Eady
*NL*
to
let
me
ride
over
on
his
wagon
to
the
Flats
,
when
he
sends
to
meet
the
*NL*
train
that
brings
his
groceries
.
I
'd
`
a
'
had
two
hours
to
wait
in
the
*NL*
station
,
but
I
'd
sooner
`
a
'
done
it
,
even
with
this
cold
,
than
to
have
*NL*
you
say
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
Jotham
'll
drive
you
over
,
''
Ethan
roused
himself
to
answer
.
*NL*
He
became
suddenly
conscious
that
he
was
looking
at
Mattie
while
Zeena
*NL*
talked
to
him
,
and
with
an
effort
he
turned
his
eyes
to
his
wife
.
She
*NL*
sat
opposite
the
window
,
and
the
pale
light
reflected
from
the
banks
of
*NL*
snow
made
her
face
look
more
than
usually
drawn
and
bloodless
,
sharpened
*NL*
the
three
parallel
creases
between
ear
and
cheek
,
and
drew
querulous
*NL*
lines
from
her
thin
nose
to
the
corners
of
her
mouth
.
Though
she
was
but
*NL*
seven
years
her
husband
's
senior
,
and
he
was
only
twenty-eight
,
she
was
*NL*
already
an
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
tried
to
say
something
befitting
the
occasion
,
but
there
was
only
*NL*
one
thought
in
his
mind
:
the
fact
that
,
for
the
first
time
since
*NL*
Mattie
had
come
to
live
with
them
,
Zeena
was
to
be
away
for
a
night
.
He
*NL*
wondered
if
the
girl
were
thinking
of
it
too
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
that
Zeena
must
be
wondering
why
he
did
not
offer
to
drive
her
*NL*
to
the
Flats
and
let
Jotham
Powell
take
the
lumber
to
Starkfield
,
and
*NL*
at
first
he
could
not
think
of
a
pretext
for
not
doing
so
;
then
he
said
:
*NL*
``
I
'd
take
you
over
myself
,
only
I
've
got
to
collect
the
cash
for
the
*NL*
lumber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
words
were
spoken
he
regretted
them
,
not
only
because
*NL*
they
were
untrue
--
there
being
no
prospect
of
his
receiving
cash
payment
*NL*
from
Hale
--
but
also
because
he
knew
from
experience
the
imprudence
of
*NL*
letting
Zeena
think
he
was
in
funds
on
the
eve
of
one
of
her
therapeutic
*NL*
excursions
.
At
the
moment
,
however
,
his
one
desire
was
to
avoid
the
long
*NL*
drive
with
her
behind
the
ancient
sorrel
who
never
went
out
of
a
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
made
no
reply
:
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
what
he
had
said
.
She
had
*NL*
already
pushed
her
plate
aside
,
and
was
measuring
out
a
draught
from
a
*NL*
large
bottle
at
her
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
done
me
a
speck
of
good
,
but
I
guess
I
might
as
well
use
it
*NL*
up
,
''
she
remarked
;
adding
,
as
she
pushed
the
empty
bottle
toward
Mattie
:
*NL*
``
If
you
can
get
the
taste
out
it
'll
do
for
pickles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
his
wife
had
driven
off
Ethan
took
his
coat
and
cap
from
the
*NL*
peg
.
Mattie
was
washing
up
the
dishes
,
humming
one
of
the
dance
tunes
*NL*
of
the
night
before
.
He
said
``
So
long
,
Matt
,
''
and
she
answered
gaily
``
So
*NL*
long
,
Ethan
''
;
and
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
warm
and
bright
in
the
kitchen
.
The
sun
slanted
through
the
south
*NL*
window
on
the
girl
's
moving
figure
,
on
the
cat
dozing
in
a
chair
,
and
on
*NL*
the
geraniums
brought
in
from
the
door-way
,
where
Ethan
had
planted
*NL*
them
in
the
summer
to
``
make
a
garden
''
for
Mattie
.
He
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
linger
on
,
watching
her
tidy
up
and
then
settle
down
to
her
sewing
;
but
*NL*
he
wanted
still
more
to
get
the
hauling
done
and
be
back
at
the
farm
*NL*
before
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
down
to
the
village
he
continued
to
think
of
his
return
to
*NL*
Mattie
.
The
kitchen
was
a
poor
place
,
not
``
spruce
''
and
shining
as
his
*NL*
mother
had
kept
it
in
his
boyhood
;
but
it
was
surprising
what
a
homelike
*NL*
look
the
mere
fact
of
Zeena
's
absence
gave
it
.
And
he
pictured
what
it
*NL*
would
be
like
that
evening
,
when
he
and
Mattie
were
there
after
supper
.
*NL*
For
the
first
time
they
would
be
alone
together
indoors
,
and
they
would
*NL*
sit
there
,
one
on
each
side
of
the
stove
,
like
a
married
couple
,
he
in
*NL*
his
stocking
feet
and
smoking
his
pipe
,
she
laughing
and
talking
in
that
*NL*
funny
way
she
had
,
which
was
always
as
new
to
him
as
if
he
had
never
*NL*
heard
her
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sweetness
of
the
picture
,
and
the
relief
of
knowing
that
his
fears
*NL*
of
``
trouble
''
with
Zeena
were
unfounded
,
sent
up
his
spirits
with
a
rush
,
*NL*
and
he
,
who
was
usually
so
silent
,
whistled
and
sang
aloud
as
he
*NL*
drove
through
the
snowy
fields
.
There
was
in
him
a
slumbering
spark
of
*NL*
sociability
which
the
long
Starkfield
winters
had
not
yet
extinguished
.
*NL*
By
nature
grave
and
inarticulate
,
he
admired
recklessness
and
gaiety
in
*NL*
others
and
was
warmed
to
the
marrow
by
friendly
human
intercourse
.
At
*NL*
Worcester
,
though
he
had
the
name
of
keeping
to
himself
and
not
being
*NL*
much
of
a
hand
at
a
good
time
,
he
had
secretly
gloried
in
being
clapped
*NL*
on
the
back
and
hailed
as
``
Old
Ethe
''
or
``
Old
Stiff
''
;
and
the
cessation
*NL*
of
such
familiarities
had
increased
the
chill
of
his
return
to
*NL*
Starkfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
the
silence
had
deepened
about
him
year
by
year
.
Left
alone
,
after
*NL*
his
father
's
accident
,
to
carry
the
burden
of
farm
and
mill
,
he
had
had
*NL*
no
time
for
convivial
loiterings
in
the
village
;
and
when
his
mother
*NL*
fell
ill
the
loneliness
of
the
house
grew
more
oppressive
than
that
*NL*
of
the
fields
.
His
mother
had
been
a
talker
in
her
day
,
but
after
her
*NL*
``
trouble
''
the
sound
of
her
voice
was
seldom
heard
,
though
she
had
not
*NL*
lost
the
power
of
speech
.
Sometimes
,
in
the
long
winter
evenings
,
when
*NL*
in
desperation
her
son
asked
her
why
she
did
n't
``
say
something
,
''
she
*NL*
would
lift
a
finger
and
answer
:
``
Because
I
'm
listening
''
;
and
on
stormy
*NL*
nights
,
when
the
loud
wind
was
about
the
house
,
she
would
complain
,
if
*NL*
he
spoke
to
her
:
``
They
're
talking
so
out
there
that
I
ca
n't
hear
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
when
she
drew
toward
her
last
illness
,
and
his
cousin
*NL*
Zenobia
Pierce
came
over
from
the
next
valley
to
help
him
nurse
her
,
*NL*
that
human
speech
was
heard
again
in
the
house
.
After
the
mortal
silence
*NL*
of
his
long
imprisonment
Zeena
's
volubility
was
music
in
his
ears
.
He
*NL*
felt
that
he
might
have
``
gone
like
his
mother
''
if
the
sound
of
a
new
*NL*
voice
had
not
come
to
steady
him
.
Zeena
seemed
to
understand
his
case
*NL*
at
a
glance
.
She
laughed
at
him
for
not
knowing
the
simplest
sick-bed
*NL*
duties
and
told
him
to
``
go
right
along
out
''
and
leave
her
to
see
to
*NL*
things
.
The
mere
fact
of
obeying
her
orders
,
of
feeling
free
to
go
about
*NL*
his
business
again
and
talk
with
other
men
,
restored
his
shaken
balance
*NL*
and
magnified
his
sense
of
what
he
owed
her
.
Her
efficiency
shamed
and
*NL*
dazzled
him
.
She
seemed
to
possess
by
instinct
all
the
household
wisdom
*NL*
that
his
long
apprenticeship
had
not
instilled
in
him
.
When
the
end
came
*NL*
it
was
she
who
had
to
tell
him
to
hitch
up
and
go
for
the
undertaker
,
*NL*
and
she
thought
it
``
funny
''
that
he
had
not
settled
beforehand
who
was
*NL*
to
have
his
mother
's
clothes
and
the
sewing-machine
.
After
the
funeral
,
*NL*
when
he
saw
her
preparing
to
go
away
,
he
was
seized
with
an
unreasoning
*NL*
dread
of
being
left
alone
on
the
farm
;
and
before
he
knew
what
he
was
*NL*
doing
he
had
asked
her
to
stay
there
with
him
.
He
had
often
thought
*NL*
since
that
it
would
not
have
happened
if
his
mother
had
died
in
spring
*NL*
instead
of
winter
...
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
married
it
was
agreed
that
,
as
soon
as
he
could
straighten
out
*NL*
the
difficulties
resulting
from
Mrs.
Frome
's
long
illness
,
they
would
*NL*
sell
the
farm
and
saw-mill
and
try
their
luck
in
a
large
town
.
Ethan
's
*NL*
love
of
nature
did
not
take
the
form
of
a
taste
for
agriculture
.
He
had
*NL*
always
wanted
to
be
an
engineer
,
and
to
live
in
towns
,
where
there
*NL*
were
lectures
and
big
libraries
and
``
fellows
doing
things
.
''
A
slight
*NL*
engineering
job
in
Florida
,
put
in
his
way
during
his
period
of
study
at
*NL*
Worcester
,
increased
his
faith
in
his
ability
as
well
as
his
eagerness
*NL*
to
see
the
world
;
and
he
felt
sure
that
,
with
a
``
smart
''
wife
like
Zeena
,
*NL*
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
had
made
himself
a
place
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
's
native
village
was
slightly
larger
and
nearer
to
the
railway
*NL*
than
Starkfield
,
and
she
had
let
her
husband
see
from
the
first
that
*NL*
life
on
an
isolated
farm
was
not
what
she
had
expected
when
she
married
.
*NL*
But
purchasers
were
slow
in
coming
,
and
while
he
waited
for
them
Ethan
*NL*
learned
the
impossibility
of
transplanting
her
.
She
chose
to
look
down
*NL*
on
Starkfield
,
but
she
could
not
have
lived
in
a
place
which
looked
*NL*
down
on
her
.
Even
Bettsbridge
or
Shadd
's
Falls
would
not
have
been
*NL*
sufficiently
aware
of
her
,
and
in
the
greater
cities
which
attracted
*NL*
Ethan
she
would
have
suffered
a
complete
loss
of
identity
.
And
within
*NL*
a
year
of
their
marriage
she
developed
the
``
sickliness
''
which
had
since
*NL*
made
her
notable
even
in
a
community
rich
in
pathological
instances
.
*NL*
When
she
came
to
take
care
of
his
mother
she
had
seemed
to
Ethan
like
*NL*
the
very
genius
of
health
,
but
he
soon
saw
that
her
skill
as
a
nurse
had
*NL*
been
acquired
by
the
absorbed
observation
of
her
own
symptoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
too
fell
silent
.
Perhaps
it
was
the
inevitable
effect
of
life
*NL*
on
the
farm
,
or
perhaps
,
as
she
sometimes
said
,
it
was
because
Ethan
*NL*
``
never
listened
.
''
The
charge
was
not
wholly
unfounded
.
When
she
spoke
*NL*
it
was
only
to
complain
,
and
to
complain
of
things
not
in
his
power
to
*NL*
remedy
;
and
to
check
a
tendency
to
impatient
retort
he
had
first
formed
*NL*
the
habit
of
not
answering
her
,
and
finally
of
thinking
of
other
things
*NL*
while
she
talked
.
Of
late
,
however
,
since
he
had
reasons
for
observing
*NL*
her
more
closely
,
her
silence
had
begun
to
trouble
him
.
He
recalled
his
*NL*
mother
's
growing
taciturnity
,
and
wondered
if
Zeena
were
also
turning
*NL*
``
queer
.
''
Women
did
,
he
knew
.
Zeena
,
who
had
at
her
fingers
'
ends
the
*NL*
pathological
chart
of
the
whole
region
,
had
cited
many
cases
of
the
kind
*NL*
while
she
was
nursing
his
mother
;
and
he
himself
knew
of
certain
lonely
*NL*
farm-houses
in
the
neighbourhood
where
stricken
creatures
pined
,
and
*NL*
of
others
where
sudden
tragedy
had
come
of
their
presence
.
At
times
,
*NL*
looking
at
Zeena
's
shut
face
,
he
felt
the
chill
of
such
forebodings
.
*NL*
At
other
times
her
silence
seemed
deliberately
assumed
to
conceal
*NL*
far-reaching
intentions
,
mysterious
conclusions
drawn
from
suspicions
*NL*
and
resentments
impossible
to
guess
.
That
supposition
was
even
more
*NL*
disturbing
than
the
other
;
and
it
was
the
one
which
had
come
to
him
the
*NL*
night
before
,
when
he
had
seen
her
standing
in
the
kitchen
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
her
departure
for
Bettsbridge
had
once
more
eased
his
mind
,
and
all
*NL*
his
thoughts
were
on
the
prospect
of
his
evening
with
Mattie
.
Only
one
*NL*
thing
weighed
on
him
,
and
that
was
his
having
told
Zeena
that
he
was
to
*NL*
receive
cash
for
the
lumber
.
He
foresaw
so
clearly
the
consequences
*NL*
of
this
imprudence
that
with
considerable
reluctance
he
decided
to
ask
*NL*
Andrew
Hale
for
a
small
advance
on
his
load
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Ethan
drove
into
Hale
's
yard
the
builder
was
just
getting
out
of
*NL*
his
sleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Ethe
!
''
he
said
.
``
This
comes
handy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Andrew
Hale
was
a
ruddy
man
with
a
big
gray
moustache
and
a
stubbly
*NL*
double-chin
unconstrained
by
a
collar
;
but
his
scrupulously
clean
shirt
*NL*
was
always
fastened
by
a
small
diamond
stud
.
This
display
of
opulence
*NL*
was
misleading
,
for
though
he
did
a
fairly
good
business
it
was
known
*NL*
that
his
easygoing
habits
and
the
demands
of
his
large
family
frequently
*NL*
kept
him
what
Starkfield
called
``
behind
.
''
He
was
an
old
friend
of
*NL*
Ethan
's
family
,
and
his
house
one
of
the
few
to
which
Zeena
occasionally
*NL*
went
,
drawn
there
by
the
fact
that
Mrs.
Hale
,
in
her
youth
,
had
done
*NL*
more
``
doctoring
''
than
any
other
woman
in
Starkfield
,
and
was
still
a
*NL*
recognised
authority
on
symptoms
and
treatment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hale
went
up
to
the
grays
and
patted
their
sweating
flanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
keep
them
two
as
if
they
was
pets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
set
about
unloading
the
logs
and
when
he
had
finished
his
job
he
*NL*
pushed
open
the
glazed
door
of
the
shed
which
the
builder
used
as
his
*NL*
office
.
Hale
sat
with
his
feet
up
on
the
stove
,
his
back
propped
against
*NL*
a
battered
desk
strewn
with
papers
:
the
place
,
like
the
man
,
was
warm
,
*NL*
genial
and
untidy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
right
down
and
thaw
out
,
''
he
greeted
Ethan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
did
not
know
how
to
begin
,
but
at
length
he
managed
to
bring
*NL*
out
his
request
for
an
advance
of
fifty
dollars
.
The
blood
rushed
to
his
*NL*
thin
skin
under
the
sting
of
Hale
's
astonishment
.
It
was
the
builder
's
*NL*
custom
to
pay
at
the
end
of
three
months
,
and
there
was
no
precedent
*NL*
between
the
two
men
for
a
cash
settlement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
felt
that
if
he
had
pleaded
an
urgent
need
Hale
might
have
made
*NL*
shift
to
pay
him
;
but
pride
,
and
an
instinctive
prudence
,
kept
him
from
*NL*
resorting
to
this
argument
.
After
his
father
's
death
it
had
taken
time
*NL*
to
get
his
head
above
water
,
and
he
did
not
want
Andrew
Hale
,
or
any
one
*NL*
else
in
Starkfield
,
to
think
he
was
going
under
again
.
Besides
,
he
hated
*NL*
lying
;
if
he
wanted
the
money
he
wanted
it
,
and
it
was
nobody
's
business
*NL*
to
ask
why
.
He
therefore
made
his
demand
with
the
awkwardness
of
a
proud
*NL*
man
who
will
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
is
stooping
;
and
he
was
not
*NL*
much
surprised
at
Hale
's
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
builder
refused
genially
,
as
he
did
everything
else
:
he
treated
the
*NL*
matter
as
something
in
the
nature
of
a
practical
joke
,
and
wanted
to
*NL*
know
if
Ethan
meditated
buying
a
grand
piano
or
adding
a
``
cupolo
''
to
his
*NL*
house
;
offering
,
in
the
latter
case
,
to
give
his
services
free
of
cost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
's
arts
were
soon
exhausted
,
and
after
an
embarrassed
pause
he
*NL*
wished
Hale
good
day
and
opened
the
door
of
the
office
.
As
he
passed
out
*NL*
the
builder
suddenly
called
after
him
:
``
See
here
--
you
ai
n't
in
a
tight
*NL*
place
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
,
''
Ethan
's
pride
retorted
before
his
reason
had
time
to
*NL*
intervene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
good
!
Because
I
am
,
a
shade
.
Fact
is
,
I
was
going
to
ask
*NL*
you
to
give
me
a
little
extra
time
on
that
payment
.
Business
is
pretty
*NL*
slack
,
to
begin
with
,
and
then
I
'm
fixing
up
a
little
house
for
Ned
and
*NL*
Ruth
when
they
're
married
.
I
'm
glad
to
do
it
for
'em
,
but
it
costs
.
''
His
*NL*
look
appealed
to
Ethan
for
sympathy
.
``
The
young
people
like
things
nice
.
*NL*
You
know
how
it
is
yourself
:
it
's
not
so
long
ago
since
you
fixed
up
*NL*
your
own
place
for
Zeena
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
left
the
grays
in
Hale
's
stable
and
went
about
some
other
business
*NL*
in
the
village
.
As
he
walked
away
the
builder
's
last
phrase
lingered
in
*NL*
his
ears
,
and
he
reflected
grimly
that
his
seven
years
with
Zeena
seemed
*NL*
to
Starkfield
``
not
so
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
was
drawing
to
an
end
,
and
here
and
there
a
lighted
pane
*NL*
spangled
the
cold
gray
dusk
and
made
the
snow
look
whiter
.
The
bitter
*NL*
weather
had
driven
every
one
indoors
and
Ethan
had
the
long
rural
street
*NL*
to
himself
.
Suddenly
he
heard
the
brisk
play
of
sleigh-bells
and
a
*NL*
cutter
passed
him
,
drawn
by
a
free-going
horse
.
Ethan
recognised
Michael
*NL*
Eady
's
roan
colt
,
and
young
Denis
Eady
,
in
a
handsome
new
fur
cap
,
*NL*
leaned
forward
and
waved
a
greeting
.
``
Hello
,
Ethe
!
''
he
shouted
and
spun
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cutter
was
going
in
the
direction
of
the
Frome
farm
,
and
Ethan
's
*NL*
heart
contracted
as
he
listened
to
the
dwindling
bells
.
What
more
likely
*NL*
than
that
Denis
Eady
had
heard
of
Zeena
's
departure
for
Bettsbridge
,
and
*NL*
was
profiting
by
the
opportunity
to
spend
an
hour
with
Mattie
?
Ethan
was
*NL*
ashamed
of
the
storm
of
jealousy
in
his
breast
.
It
seemed
unworthy
of
*NL*
the
girl
that
his
thoughts
of
her
should
be
so
violent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
to
the
church
corner
and
entered
the
shade
of
the
Varnum
*NL*
spruces
,
where
he
had
stood
with
her
the
night
before
.
As
he
passed
*NL*
into
their
gloom
he
saw
an
indistinct
outline
just
ahead
of
him
.
At
*NL*
his
approach
it
melted
for
an
instant
into
two
separate
shapes
and
then
*NL*
conjoined
again
,
and
he
heard
a
kiss
,
and
a
half-laughing
``
Oh
!
''
provoked
*NL*
by
the
discovery
of
his
presence
.
Again
the
outline
hastily
disunited
*NL*
and
the
Varnum
gate
slammed
on
one
half
while
the
other
hurried
on
ahead
*NL*
of
him
.
Ethan
smiled
at
the
discomfiture
he
had
caused
.
What
did
it
*NL*
matter
to
Ned
Hale
and
Ruth
Varnum
if
they
were
caught
kissing
each
*NL*
other
?
Everybody
in
Starkfield
knew
they
were
engaged
.
It
pleased
Ethan
*NL*
to
have
surprised
a
pair
of
lovers
on
the
spot
where
he
and
Mattie
had
*NL*
stood
with
such
a
thirst
for
each
other
in
their
hearts
;
but
he
felt
a
*NL*
pang
at
the
thought
that
these
two
need
not
hide
their
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fetched
the
grays
from
Hale
's
stable
and
started
on
his
long
climb
*NL*
back
to
the
farm
.
The
cold
was
less
sharp
than
earlier
in
the
day
and
a
*NL*
thick
fleecy
sky
threatened
snow
for
the
morrow
.
Here
and
there
a
star
*NL*
pricked
through
,
showing
behind
it
a
deep
well
of
blue
.
In
an
hour
*NL*
or
two
the
moon
would
push
over
the
ridge
behind
the
farm
,
burn
a
*NL*
gold-edged
rent
in
the
clouds
,
and
then
be
swallowed
by
them
.
A
mournful
*NL*
peace
hung
on
the
fields
,
as
though
they
felt
the
relaxing
grasp
of
the
*NL*
cold
and
stretched
themselves
in
their
long
winter
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
's
ears
were
alert
for
the
jingle
of
sleigh-bells
,
but
not
a
sound
*NL*
broke
the
silence
of
the
lonely
road
.
As
he
drew
near
the
farm
he
saw
,
*NL*
through
the
thin
screen
of
larches
at
the
gate
,
a
light
twinkling
in
*NL*
the
house
above
him
.
``
She
's
up
in
her
room
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
fixing
*NL*
herself
up
for
supper
''
;
and
he
remembered
Zeena
's
sarcastic
stare
when
*NL*
Mattie
,
on
the
evening
of
her
arrival
,
had
come
down
to
supper
with
*NL*
smoothed
hair
and
a
ribbon
at
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
by
the
graves
on
the
knoll
and
turned
his
head
to
glance
at
*NL*
one
of
the
older
headstones
,
which
had
interested
him
deeply
as
a
boy
*NL*
because
it
bore
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
SACRED
TO
THE
MEMORY
OF
*NL*
*NL*
ETHAN
FROME
AND
ENDURANCE
HIS
WIFE
,
*NL*
*NL*
WHO
DWELLED
TOGETHER
IN
PEACE
*NL*
*NL*
FOR
FIFTY
YEARS
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
used
to
think
that
fifty
years
sounded
like
a
long
time
to
live
*NL*
together
;
but
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
might
pass
in
a
flash
.
*NL*
Then
,
with
a
sudden
dart
of
irony
,
he
wondered
if
,
when
their
turn
came
,
*NL*
the
same
epitaph
would
be
written
over
him
and
Zeena
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
barn-door
and
craned
his
head
into
the
obscurity
,
*NL*
half-fearing
to
discover
Denis
Eady
's
roan
colt
in
the
stall
beside
*NL*
the
sorrel
.
But
the
old
horse
was
there
alone
,
mumbling
his
crib
with
*NL*
toothless
jaws
,
and
Ethan
whistled
cheerfully
while
he
bedded
down
the
*NL*
grays
and
shook
an
extra
measure
of
oats
into
their
mangers
.
His
was
not
*NL*
a
tuneful
throat
--
but
harsh
melodies
burst
from
it
as
he
locked
the
barn
*NL*
and
sprang
up
the
hill
to
the
house
.
He
reached
the
kitchen-porch
and
*NL*
turned
the
door-handle
;
but
the
door
did
not
yield
to
his
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Startled
at
finding
it
locked
he
rattled
the
handle
violently
;
then
*NL*
he
reflected
that
Mattie
was
alone
and
that
it
was
natural
she
should
*NL*
barricade
herself
at
nightfall
.
He
stood
in
the
darkness
expecting
to
*NL*
hear
her
step
.
It
did
not
come
,
and
after
vainly
straining
his
ears
he
*NL*
called
out
in
a
voice
that
shook
with
joy
:
``
Hello
,
Matt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
answered
;
but
in
a
minute
or
two
he
caught
a
sound
on
the
stairs
*NL*
and
saw
a
line
of
light
about
the
door-frame
,
as
he
had
seen
it
the
*NL*
night
before
.
So
strange
was
the
precision
with
which
the
incidents
of
*NL*
the
previous
evening
were
repeating
themselves
that
he
half
expected
,
*NL*
when
he
heard
the
key
turn
,
to
see
his
wife
before
him
on
the
threshold
;
*NL*
but
the
door
opened
,
and
Mattie
faced
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
just
as
Zeena
had
stood
,
a
lifted
lamp
in
her
hand
,
against
*NL*
the
black
background
of
the
kitchen
.
She
held
the
light
at
the
same
*NL*
level
,
and
it
drew
out
with
the
same
distinctness
her
slim
young
throat
*NL*
and
the
brown
wrist
no
bigger
than
a
child
's
.
Then
,
striking
upward
,
it
*NL*
threw
a
lustrous
fleck
on
her
lips
,
edged
her
eyes
with
velvet
shade
,
*NL*
and
laid
a
milky
whiteness
above
the
black
curve
of
her
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wore
her
usual
dress
of
darkish
stuff
,
and
there
was
no
bow
at
her
*NL*
neck
;
but
through
her
hair
she
had
run
a
streak
of
crimson
ribbon
.
This
*NL*
tribute
to
the
unusual
transformed
and
glorified
her
.
She
seemed
to
*NL*
Ethan
taller
,
fuller
,
more
womanly
in
shape
and
motion
.
She
stood
aside
,
*NL*
smiling
silently
,
while
he
entered
,
and
then
moved
away
from
him
with
*NL*
something
soft
and
flowing
in
her
gait
.
She
set
the
lamp
on
the
table
,
*NL*
and
he
saw
that
it
was
carefully
laid
for
supper
,
with
fresh
dough-nuts
,
*NL*
stewed
blueberries
and
his
favourite
pickles
in
a
dish
of
gay
red
glass
.
*NL*
A
bright
fire
glowed
in
the
stove
and
the
cat
lay
stretched
before
it
,
*NL*
watching
the
table
with
a
drowsy
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
was
suffocated
with
the
sense
of
well-being
.
He
went
out
into
the
*NL*
passage
to
hang
up
his
coat
and
pull
off
his
wet
boots
.
When
he
came
*NL*
back
Mattie
had
set
the
teapot
on
the
table
and
the
cat
was
rubbing
*NL*
itself
persuasively
against
her
ankles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Puss
!
I
nearly
tripped
over
you
,
''
she
cried
,
the
laughter
*NL*
sparkling
through
her
lashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Ethan
felt
a
sudden
twinge
of
jealousy
.
Could
it
be
his
coming
*NL*
that
gave
her
such
a
kindled
face
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Matt
,
any
visitors
?
''
he
threw
off
,
stooping
down
carelessly
to
*NL*
examine
the
fastening
of
the
stove
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
and
laughed
``
Yes
,
one
,
''
and
he
felt
a
blackness
settling
on
*NL*
his
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
that
?
''
he
questioned
,
raising
himself
up
to
slant
a
glance
at
*NL*
her
beneath
his
scowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
danced
with
malice
.
``
Why
,
Jotham
Powell
.
He
came
in
after
he
*NL*
got
back
,
and
asked
for
a
drop
of
coffee
before
he
went
down
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blackness
lifted
and
light
flooded
Ethan
's
brain
.
``
That
all
?
Well
,
*NL*
I
hope
you
made
out
to
let
him
have
it
.
''
And
after
a
pause
he
felt
it
*NL*
right
to
add
:
``
I
suppose
he
got
Zeena
over
to
the
Flats
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
in
plenty
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
threw
a
chill
between
them
,
and
they
stood
a
moment
looking
*NL*
sideways
at
each
other
before
Mattie
said
with
a
shy
laugh
.
``
I
guess
*NL*
it
's
about
time
for
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
drew
their
seats
up
to
the
table
,
and
the
cat
,
unbidden
,
jumped
*NL*
between
them
into
Zeena
's
empty
chair
.
``
Oh
,
Puss
!
''
said
Mattie
,
and
they
*NL*
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
,
a
moment
earlier
,
had
felt
himself
on
the
brink
of
eloquence
;
*NL*
but
the
mention
of
Zeena
had
paralysed
him
.
Mattie
seemed
to
feel
the
*NL*
contagion
of
his
embarrassment
,
and
sat
with
downcast
lids
,
sipping
her
*NL*
tea
,
while
he
feigned
an
insatiable
appetite
for
dough-nuts
and
sweet
*NL*
pickles
.
At
last
,
after
casting
about
for
an
effective
opening
,
he
took
*NL*
a
long
gulp
of
tea
,
cleared
his
throat
,
and
said
:
``
Looks
as
if
there
'd
*NL*
be
more
snow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
feigned
great
interest
.
``
Is
that
so
?
Do
you
suppose
it
'll
interfere
*NL*
with
Zeena
's
getting
back
?
''
She
flushed
red
as
the
question
escaped
her
,
*NL*
and
hastily
set
down
the
cup
she
was
lifting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
reached
over
for
another
helping
of
pickles
.
``
You
never
can
tell
,
*NL*
this
time
of
year
,
it
drifts
so
bad
on
the
Flats
.
''
The
name
had
benumbed
*NL*
him
again
,
and
once
more
he
felt
as
if
Zeena
were
in
the
room
between
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Puss
,
you
're
too
greedy
!
''
Mattie
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cat
,
unnoticed
,
had
crept
up
on
muffled
paws
from
Zeena
's
seat
to
*NL*
the
table
,
and
was
stealthily
elongating
its
body
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
the
milk-jug
,
which
stood
between
Ethan
and
Mattie
.
The
two
leaned
*NL*
forward
at
the
same
moment
and
their
hands
met
on
the
handle
of
the
jug
.
*NL*
Mattie
's
hand
was
underneath
,
and
Ethan
kept
his
clasped
on
it
a
*NL*
moment
longer
than
was
necessary
.
The
cat
,
profiting
by
this
unusual
*NL*
demonstration
,
tried
to
effect
an
unnoticed
retreat
,
and
in
doing
so
*NL*
backed
into
the
pickle-dish
,
which
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
,
in
an
instant
,
had
sprung
from
her
chair
and
was
down
on
her
*NL*
knees
by
the
fragments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Ethan
,
Ethan
--
it
's
all
to
pieces
!
What
will
Zeena
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
his
courage
was
up
.
``
Well
,
she
'll
have
to
say
it
to
the
*NL*
cat
,
any
way
!
''
he
rejoined
with
a
laugh
,
kneeling
down
at
Mattie
's
side
*NL*
to
scrape
up
the
swimming
pickles
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
stricken
eyes
to
him
.
``
Yes
,
but
,
you
see
,
she
never
meant
it
*NL*
should
be
used
,
not
even
when
there
was
company
;
and
I
had
to
get
up
on
*NL*
the
step-ladder
to
reach
it
down
from
the
top
shelf
of
the
china-closet
,
*NL*
where
she
keeps
it
with
all
her
best
things
,
and
of
course
she
'll
want
*NL*
to
know
why
I
did
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
was
so
serious
that
it
called
forth
all
of
Ethan
's
latent
*NL*
resolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
need
n't
know
anything
about
it
if
you
keep
quiet
.
I
'll
get
another
*NL*
just
like
it
to-morrow
.
Where
did
it
come
from
?
I
'll
go
to
Shadd
's
Falls
*NL*
for
it
if
I
have
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
'll
never
get
another
even
there
!
It
was
a
wedding
present
--
do
n't
*NL*
you
remember
?
It
came
all
the
way
from
Philadelphia
,
from
Zeena
's
aunt
*NL*
that
married
the
minister
.
That
's
why
she
would
n't
ever
use
it
.
Oh
,
*NL*
Ethan
,
Ethan
,
what
in
the
world
shall
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
cry
,
and
he
felt
as
if
every
one
of
her
tears
were
pouring
*NL*
over
him
like
burning
lead
.
``
Do
n't
,
Matt
,
do
n't
--
oh
,
do
n't
!
''
he
implored
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
struggled
to
her
feet
,
and
he
rose
and
followed
her
helplessly
while
*NL*
she
spread
out
the
pieces
of
glass
on
the
kitchen
dresser
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
him
as
if
the
shattered
fragments
of
their
evening
lay
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
give
them
to
me
,
''
he
said
in
a
voice
of
sudden
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
aside
,
instinctively
obeying
his
tone
.
``
Oh
,
Ethan
,
what
are
you
*NL*
going
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
replying
he
gathered
the
pieces
of
glass
into
his
broad
palm
*NL*
and
walked
out
of
the
kitchen
to
the
passage
.
There
he
lit
a
candle-end
,
*NL*
opened
the
china-closet
,
and
,
reaching
his
long
arm
up
to
the
highest
*NL*
shelf
,
laid
the
pieces
together
with
such
accuracy
of
touch
that
a
close
*NL*
inspection
convinced
him
of
the
impossibility
of
detecting
from
below
*NL*
that
the
dish
was
broken
.
If
he
glued
it
together
the
next
morning
*NL*
months
might
elapse
before
his
wife
noticed
what
had
happened
,
and
*NL*
meanwhile
he
might
after
all
be
able
to
match
the
dish
at
Shadd
's
Falls
*NL*
or
Bettsbridge
.
Having
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
no
risk
of
*NL*
immediate
discovery
he
went
back
to
the
kitchen
with
a
lighter
step
,
and
*NL*
found
Mattie
disconsolately
removing
the
last
scraps
of
pickle
from
the
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
Matt
.
Come
back
and
finish
supper
,
''
he
commanded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Completely
reassured
,
she
shone
on
him
through
tear-hung
lashes
,
and
his
*NL*
soul
swelled
with
pride
as
he
saw
how
his
tone
subdued
her
.
She
did
not
*NL*
even
ask
what
he
had
done
.
Except
when
he
was
steering
a
big
log
down
*NL*
the
mountain
to
his
mill
he
had
never
known
such
a
thrilling
sense
of
*NL*
mastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
finished
supper
,
and
while
Mattie
cleared
the
table
Ethan
went
to
*NL*
look
at
the
cows
and
then
took
a
last
turn
about
the
house
.
The
earth
*NL*
lay
dark
under
a
muffled
sky
and
the
air
was
so
still
that
now
and
then
*NL*
he
heard
a
lump
of
snow
come
thumping
down
from
a
tree
far
off
on
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
wood-lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
returned
to
the
kitchen
Mattie
had
pushed
up
his
chair
to
the
*NL*
stove
and
seated
herself
near
the
lamp
with
a
bit
of
sewing
.
The
scene
*NL*
was
just
as
he
had
dreamed
of
it
that
morning
.
He
sat
down
,
drew
his
*NL*
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
stretched
his
feet
to
the
glow
.
His
hard
day
's
*NL*
work
in
the
keen
air
made
him
feel
at
once
lazy
and
light
of
mood
,
and
*NL*
he
had
a
confused
sense
of
being
in
another
world
,
where
all
was
warmth
*NL*
and
harmony
and
time
could
bring
no
change
.
The
only
drawback
to
his
*NL*
complete
well-being
was
the
fact
that
he
could
not
see
Mattie
from
where
*NL*
he
sat
;
but
he
was
too
indolent
to
move
and
after
a
moment
he
said
:
*NL*
``
Come
over
here
and
sit
by
the
stove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
's
empty
rocking-chair
stood
facing
him
.
Mattie
rose
obediently
,
*NL*
and
seated
herself
in
it
.
As
her
young
brown
head
detached
itself
*NL*
against
the
patch-work
cushion
that
habitually
framed
his
wife
's
gaunt
*NL*
countenance
,
Ethan
had
a
momentary
shock
.
It
was
almost
as
if
the
other
*NL*
face
,
the
face
of
the
superseded
woman
,
had
obliterated
that
of
the
*NL*
intruder
.
After
a
moment
Mattie
seemed
to
be
affected
by
the
same
sense
*NL*
of
constraint
.
She
changed
her
position
,
leaning
forward
to
bend
her
*NL*
head
above
her
work
,
so
that
he
saw
only
the
foreshortened
tip
of
her
*NL*
nose
and
the
streak
of
red
in
her
hair
;
then
she
slipped
to
her
feet
,
*NL*
saying
``
I
ca
n't
see
to
sew
,
''
and
went
back
to
her
chair
by
the
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
made
a
pretext
of
getting
up
to
replenish
the
stove
,
and
when
he
*NL*
returned
to
his
seat
he
pushed
it
sideways
that
he
might
get
a
view
of
*NL*
her
profile
and
of
the
lamplight
falling
on
her
hands
.
The
cat
,
who
*NL*
had
been
a
puzzled
observer
of
these
unusual
movements
,
jumped
up
into
*NL*
Zeena
's
chair
,
rolled
itself
into
a
ball
,
and
lay
watching
them
with
*NL*
narrowed
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Deep
quiet
sank
on
the
room
.
The
clock
ticked
above
the
dresser
,
a
piece
*NL*
of
charred
wood
fell
now
and
then
in
the
stove
,
and
the
faint
sharp
*NL*
scent
of
the
geraniums
mingled
with
the
odour
of
Ethan
's
smoke
,
which
*NL*
began
to
throw
a
blue
haze
about
the
lamp
and
to
hang
its
greyish
*NL*
cobwebs
in
the
shadowy
corners
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
constraint
had
vanished
between
the
two
,
and
they
began
to
talk
*NL*
easily
and
simply
.
They
spoke
of
every-day
things
,
of
the
prospect
*NL*
of
snow
,
of
the
next
church
sociable
,
of
the
loves
and
quarrels
of
*NL*
Starkfield
.
The
commonplace
nature
of
what
they
said
produced
in
Ethan
*NL*
an
illusion
of
long-established
intimacy
which
no
outburst
of
emotion
*NL*
could
have
given
,
and
he
set
his
imagination
adrift
on
the
fiction
that
*NL*
they
had
always
spent
their
evenings
thus
and
would
always
go
on
doing
*NL*
so
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
night
we
were
to
have
gone
coasting
,
Matt
,
''
he
said
at
*NL*
length
,
with
the
rich
sense
,
as
he
spoke
,
that
they
could
go
on
any
*NL*
other
night
they
chose
,
since
they
had
all
time
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
back
at
him
.
``
I
guess
you
forgot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
forget
;
but
it
's
as
dark
as
Egypt
outdoors
.
We
might
go
*NL*
to-morrow
if
there
's
a
moon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
with
pleasure
,
her
head
tilted
back
,
the
lamplight
sparkling
*NL*
on
her
lips
and
teeth
.
``
That
would
be
lovely
,
Ethan
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
,
marvelling
at
the
way
her
face
changed
*NL*
with
each
turn
of
their
talk
,
like
a
wheat-field
under
a
summer
breeze
.
*NL*
It
was
intoxicating
to
find
such
magic
in
his
clumsy
words
,
and
he
*NL*
longed
to
try
new
ways
of
using
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
be
scared
to
go
down
the
Corbury
road
with
me
on
a
night
like
*NL*
this
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
cheeks
burned
redder
.
``
I
ai
n't
any
more
scared
than
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'd
be
scared
,
then
;
I
would
n't
do
it
.
That
's
an
ugly
corner
down
*NL*
by
the
big
elm
.
If
a
fellow
did
n't
keep
his
eyes
open
he
'd
go
plumb
into
*NL*
it
.
''
He
luxuriated
in
the
sense
of
protection
and
authority
which
his
*NL*
words
conveyed
.
To
prolong
and
intensify
the
feeling
he
added
:
``
I
guess
*NL*
we
're
well
enough
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
let
her
lids
sink
slowly
,
in
the
way
he
loved
.
``
Yes
,
we
're
well
*NL*
enough
here
,
''
she
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
was
so
sweet
that
he
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
drew
his
*NL*
chair
up
to
the
table
.
Leaning
forward
,
he
touched
the
farther
end
of
*NL*
the
strip
of
brown
stuff
that
she
was
hemming
.
``
Say
,
Matt
,
''
he
began
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
``
what
do
you
think
I
saw
under
the
Varnum
spruces
,
coming
*NL*
along
home
just
now
?
I
saw
a
friend
of
yours
getting
kissed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
had
been
on
his
tongue
all
the
evening
,
but
now
that
he
had
*NL*
spoken
them
they
struck
him
as
inexpressibly
vulgar
and
out
of
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
blushed
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
and
pulled
her
needle
rapidly
*NL*
twice
or
thrice
through
her
work
,
insensibly
drawing
the
end
of
it
away
*NL*
from
him
.
``
I
suppose
it
was
Ruth
and
Ned
,
''
she
said
in
a
low
voice
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
suddenly
touched
on
something
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
had
imagined
that
his
allusion
might
open
the
way
to
the
accepted
*NL*
pleasantries
,
and
these
perhaps
in
turn
to
a
harmless
caress
,
if
only
*NL*
a
mere
touch
on
her
hand
.
But
now
he
felt
as
if
her
blush
had
set
a
*NL*
flaming
guard
about
her
.
He
supposed
it
was
his
natural
awkwardness
that
*NL*
made
him
feel
so
.
He
knew
that
most
young
men
made
nothing
at
all
of
*NL*
giving
a
pretty
girl
a
kiss
,
and
he
remembered
that
the
night
before
,
*NL*
when
he
had
put
his
arm
about
Mattie
,
she
had
not
resisted
.
But
that
had
*NL*
been
out-of-doors
,
under
the
open
irresponsible
night
.
Now
,
in
the
warm
*NL*
lamplit
room
,
with
all
its
ancient
implications
of
conformity
and
order
,
*NL*
she
seemed
infinitely
farther
away
from
him
and
more
unapproachable
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
ease
his
constraint
he
said
:
``
I
suppose
they
'll
be
setting
a
date
*NL*
before
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
should
n't
wonder
if
they
got
married
some
time
along
in
the
*NL*
summer
.
''
She
pronounced
the
word
married
as
if
her
voice
caressed
it
.
*NL*
It
seemed
a
rustling
covert
leading
to
enchanted
glades
.
A
pang
shot
*NL*
through
Ethan
,
and
he
said
,
twisting
away
from
her
in
his
chair
:
``
It
'll
*NL*
be
your
turn
next
,
I
would
n't
wonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
a
little
uncertainly
.
``
Why
do
you
keep
on
saying
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
echoed
her
laugh
.
``
I
guess
I
do
it
to
get
used
to
the
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
up
to
the
table
again
and
she
sewed
on
in
silence
,
with
dropped
*NL*
lashes
,
while
he
sat
in
fascinated
contemplation
of
the
way
in
which
her
*NL*
hands
went
up
and
down
above
the
strip
of
stuff
,
just
as
he
had
seen
*NL*
a
pair
of
birds
make
short
perpendicular
flights
over
a
nest
they
were
*NL*
building
.
At
length
,
without
turning
her
head
or
lifting
her
lids
,
she
*NL*
said
in
a
low
tone
:
``
It
's
not
because
you
think
Zeena
's
got
anything
*NL*
against
me
,
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
former
dread
started
up
full-armed
at
the
suggestion
.
``
Why
,
what
do
*NL*
you
mean
?
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
distressed
eyes
to
his
,
her
work
dropping
on
the
table
*NL*
between
them
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
thought
last
night
she
seemed
to
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
know
what
,
''
he
growled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
can
tell
with
Zeena
.
''
It
was
the
first
time
they
had
ever
spoken
*NL*
so
openly
of
her
attitude
toward
Mattie
,
and
the
repetition
of
the
name
*NL*
seemed
to
carry
it
to
the
farther
corners
of
the
room
and
send
it
back
*NL*
to
them
in
long
repercussions
of
sound
.
Mattie
waited
,
as
if
to
give
the
*NL*
echo
time
to
drop
,
and
then
went
on
:
``
She
has
n't
said
anything
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
.
``
No
,
not
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tossed
the
hair
back
from
her
forehead
with
a
laugh
.
``
I
guess
I
'm
*NL*
just
nervous
,
then
.
I
'm
not
going
to
think
about
it
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
--
do
n't
let
's
think
about
it
,
Matt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sudden
heat
of
his
tone
made
her
colour
mount
again
,
not
with
*NL*
a
rush
,
but
gradually
,
delicately
,
like
the
reflection
of
a
thought
*NL*
stealing
slowly
across
her
heart
.
She
sat
silent
,
her
hands
clasped
on
*NL*
her
work
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
warm
current
flowed
toward
*NL*
him
along
the
strip
of
stuff
that
still
lay
unrolled
between
them
.
*NL*
Cautiously
he
slid
his
hand
palm-downward
along
the
table
till
his
*NL*
finger-tips
touched
the
end
of
the
stuff
.
A
faint
vibration
of
her
*NL*
lashes
seemed
to
show
that
she
was
aware
of
his
gesture
,
and
that
it
had
*NL*
sent
a
counter-current
back
to
her
;
and
she
let
her
hands
lie
motionless
*NL*
on
the
other
end
of
the
strip
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
sat
thus
he
heard
a
sound
behind
him
and
turned
his
head
.
The
*NL*
cat
had
jumped
from
Zeena
's
chair
to
dart
at
a
mouse
in
the
wainscot
,
*NL*
and
as
a
result
of
the
sudden
movement
the
empty
chair
had
set
up
a
*NL*
spectral
rocking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
be
rocking
in
it
herself
this
time
to-morrow
,
''
Ethan
thought
.
*NL*
``
I
've
been
in
a
dream
,
and
this
is
the
only
evening
we
'll
ever
have
*NL*
together
.
''
The
return
to
reality
was
as
painful
as
the
return
to
*NL*
consciousness
after
taking
an
anaesthetic
.
His
body
and
brain
ached
with
*NL*
indescribable
weariness
,
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
or
to
do
*NL*
that
should
arrest
the
mad
flight
of
the
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
alteration
of
mood
seemed
to
have
communicated
itself
to
Mattie
.
She
*NL*
looked
up
at
him
languidly
,
as
though
her
lids
were
weighted
with
sleep
*NL*
and
it
cost
her
an
effort
to
raise
them
.
Her
glance
fell
on
his
hand
,
*NL*
which
now
completely
covered
the
end
of
her
work
and
grasped
it
as
if
it
*NL*
were
a
part
of
herself
.
He
saw
a
scarcely
perceptible
tremor
cross
her
*NL*
face
,
and
without
knowing
what
he
did
he
stooped
his
head
and
kissed
*NL*
the
bit
of
stuff
in
his
hold
.
As
his
lips
rested
on
it
he
felt
it
glide
*NL*
slowly
from
beneath
them
,
and
saw
that
Mattie
had
risen
and
was
silently
*NL*
rolling
up
her
work
.
She
fastened
it
with
a
pin
,
and
then
,
finding
*NL*
her
thimble
and
scissors
,
put
them
with
the
roll
of
stuff
into
the
*NL*
box
covered
with
fancy
paper
which
he
had
once
brought
to
her
from
*NL*
Bettsbridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
also
,
looking
vaguely
about
the
room
.
The
clock
above
the
*NL*
dresser
struck
eleven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
fire
all
right
?
''
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
door
of
the
stove
and
poked
aimlessly
at
the
embers
.
When
*NL*
he
raised
himself
again
he
saw
that
she
was
dragging
toward
the
stove
*NL*
the
old
soap-box
lined
with
carpet
in
which
the
cat
made
its
bed
.
Then
*NL*
she
recrossed
the
floor
and
lifted
two
of
the
geranium
pots
in
her
arms
,
*NL*
moving
them
away
from
the
cold
window
.
He
followed
her
and
brought
the
*NL*
other
geraniums
,
the
hyacinth
bulbs
in
a
cracked
custard
bowl
and
the
*NL*
German
ivy
trained
over
an
old
croquet
hoop
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
nightly
duties
were
performed
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
*NL*
but
to
bring
in
the
tin
candlestick
from
the
passage
,
light
the
candle
*NL*
and
blow
out
the
lamp
.
Ethan
put
the
candlestick
in
Mattie
's
hand
and
*NL*
she
went
out
of
the
kitchen
ahead
of
him
,
the
light
that
she
carried
*NL*
before
her
making
her
dark
hair
look
like
a
drift
of
mist
on
the
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
Matt
,
''
he
said
as
she
put
her
foot
on
the
first
step
of
the
*NL*
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
and
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
``
Good
night
,
Ethan
,
''
she
*NL*
answered
,
and
went
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
door
of
her
room
had
closed
on
her
he
remembered
that
he
had
*NL*
not
even
touched
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
at
breakfast
Jotham
Powell
was
between
them
,
and
Ethan
*NL*
tried
to
hide
his
joy
under
an
air
of
exaggerated
indifference
,
lounging
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
to
throw
scraps
to
the
cat
,
growling
at
the
weather
,
*NL*
and
not
so
much
as
offering
to
help
Mattie
when
she
rose
to
clear
away
*NL*
the
dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
why
he
was
so
irrationally
happy
,
for
nothing
was
*NL*
changed
in
his
life
or
hers
.
He
had
not
even
touched
the
tip
of
her
*NL*
fingers
or
looked
her
full
in
the
eyes
.
But
their
evening
together
had
*NL*
given
him
a
vision
of
what
life
at
her
side
might
be
,
and
he
was
glad
*NL*
now
that
he
had
done
nothing
to
trouble
the
sweetness
of
the
picture
.
He
*NL*
had
a
fancy
that
she
knew
what
had
restrained
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
last
load
of
lumber
to
be
hauled
to
the
village
,
and
Jotham
*NL*
Powell
--
who
did
not
work
regularly
for
Ethan
in
winter
--
had
``
come
round
''
*NL*
to
help
with
the
job
.
But
a
wet
snow
,
melting
to
sleet
,
had
fallen
in
*NL*
the
night
and
turned
the
roads
to
glass
.
There
was
more
wet
in
the
air
*NL*
and
it
seemed
likely
to
both
men
that
the
weather
would
``
milden
''
toward
*NL*
afternoon
and
make
the
going
safer
.
Ethan
therefore
proposed
to
his
*NL*
assistant
that
they
should
load
the
sledge
at
the
wood-lot
,
as
they
had
*NL*
done
on
the
previous
morning
,
and
put
off
the
``
teaming
''
to
Starkfield
*NL*
till
later
in
the
day
.
This
plan
had
the
advantage
of
enabling
him
to
*NL*
send
Jotham
to
the
Flats
after
dinner
to
meet
Zenobia
,
while
he
himself
*NL*
took
the
lumber
down
to
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
Jotham
to
go
out
and
harness
up
the
greys
,
and
for
a
moment
he
*NL*
and
Mattie
had
the
kitchen
to
themselves
.
She
had
plunged
the
breakfast
*NL*
dishes
into
a
tin
dish-pan
and
was
bending
above
it
with
her
slim
arms
*NL*
bared
to
the
elbow
,
the
steam
from
the
hot
water
beading
her
forehead
*NL*
and
tightening
her
rough
hair
into
little
brown
rings
like
the
tendrils
*NL*
on
the
traveller
's
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
stood
looking
at
her
,
his
heart
in
his
throat
.
He
wanted
to
say
:
*NL*
``
We
shall
never
be
alone
again
like
this
.
''
Instead
,
he
reached
down
his
*NL*
tobacco-pouch
from
a
shelf
of
the
dresser
,
put
it
into
his
pocket
and
*NL*
said
:
``
I
guess
I
can
make
out
to
be
home
for
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
``
All
right
,
Ethan
,
''
and
he
heard
her
singing
over
the
*NL*
dishes
as
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
sledge
was
loaded
he
meant
to
send
Jotham
back
to
*NL*
the
farm
and
hurry
on
foot
into
the
village
to
buy
the
glue
for
the
*NL*
pickle-dish
.
With
ordinary
luck
he
should
have
had
time
to
carry
out
*NL*
this
plan
;
but
everything
went
wrong
from
the
start
.
On
the
way
over
*NL*
to
the
wood-lot
one
of
the
greys
slipped
on
a
glare
of
ice
and
cut
his
*NL*
knee
;
and
when
they
got
him
up
again
Jotham
had
to
go
back
to
the
barn
*NL*
for
a
strip
of
rag
to
bind
the
cut
.
Then
,
when
the
loading
finally
*NL*
began
,
a
sleety
rain
was
coming
down
once
more
,
and
the
tree
trunks
were
*NL*
so
slippery
that
it
took
twice
as
long
as
usual
to
lift
them
and
get
*NL*
them
in
place
on
the
sledge
.
It
was
what
Jotham
called
a
sour
morning
*NL*
for
work
,
and
the
horses
,
shivering
and
stamping
under
their
wet
*NL*
blankets
,
seemed
to
like
it
as
little
as
the
men
.
It
was
long
past
the
*NL*
dinner-hour
when
the
job
was
done
,
and
Ethan
had
to
give
up
going
to
the
*NL*
village
because
he
wanted
to
lead
the
injured
horse
home
and
wash
the
*NL*
cut
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
that
by
starting
out
again
with
the
lumber
as
soon
as
he
had
*NL*
finished
his
dinner
he
might
get
back
to
the
farm
with
the
glue
before
*NL*
Jotham
and
the
old
sorrel
had
had
time
to
fetch
Zenobia
from
the
Flats
;
*NL*
but
he
knew
the
chance
was
a
slight
one
.
It
turned
on
the
state
of
*NL*
the
roads
and
on
the
possible
lateness
of
the
Bettsbridge
train
.
*NL*
He
remembered
afterward
,
with
a
grim
flash
of
self-derision
,
what
*NL*
importance
he
had
attached
to
the
weighing
of
these
probabilities
...
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
dinner
was
over
he
set
out
again
for
the
wood-lot
,
not
daring
*NL*
to
linger
till
Jotham
Powell
left
.
The
hired
man
was
still
drying
his
*NL*
wet
feet
at
the
stove
,
and
Ethan
could
only
give
Mattie
a
quick
look
as
*NL*
he
said
beneath
his
breath
:
``
I
'll
be
back
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fancied
that
she
nodded
her
comprehension
;
and
with
that
scant
solace
*NL*
he
had
to
trudge
off
through
the
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
driven
his
load
half-way
to
the
village
when
Jotham
Powell
*NL*
overtook
him
,
urging
the
reluctant
sorrel
toward
the
Flats
.
``
I
'll
have
*NL*
to
hurry
up
to
do
it
,
''
Ethan
mused
,
as
the
sleigh
dropped
down
ahead
*NL*
of
him
over
the
dip
of
the
school-house
hill
.
He
worked
like
ten
at
the
*NL*
unloading
,
and
when
it
was
over
hastened
on
to
Michael
Eady
's
for
the
*NL*
glue
.
Eady
and
his
assistant
were
both
``
down
street
,
''
and
young
Denis
,
*NL*
who
seldom
deigned
to
take
their
place
,
was
lounging
by
the
stove
with
*NL*
a
knot
of
the
golden
youth
of
Starkfield
.
They
hailed
Ethan
with
ironic
*NL*
compliment
and
offers
of
conviviality
;
but
no
one
knew
where
to
find
*NL*
the
glue
.
Ethan
,
consumed
with
the
longing
for
a
last
moment
alone
with
*NL*
Mattie
,
hung
about
impatiently
while
Denis
made
an
ineffectual
search
in
*NL*
the
obscurer
corners
of
the
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looks
as
if
we
were
all
sold
out
.
But
if
you
'll
wait
around
till
the
*NL*
old
man
comes
along
maybe
he
can
put
his
hand
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
obliged
to
you
,
but
I
'll
try
if
I
can
get
it
down
at
Mrs.
Homan
's
,
''
*NL*
Ethan
answered
,
burning
to
be
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denis
's
commercial
instinct
compelled
him
to
aver
on
oath
that
what
*NL*
Eady
's
store
could
not
produce
would
never
be
found
at
the
widow
*NL*
Homan
's
;
but
Ethan
,
heedless
of
this
boast
,
had
already
climbed
to
*NL*
the
sledge
and
was
driving
on
to
the
rival
establishment
.
Here
,
after
*NL*
considerable
search
,
and
sympathetic
questions
as
to
what
he
wanted
*NL*
it
for
,
and
whether
ordinary
flour
paste
would
n't
do
as
well
if
she
*NL*
could
n't
find
it
,
the
widow
Homan
finally
hunted
down
her
solitary
*NL*
bottle
of
glue
to
its
hiding-place
in
a
medley
of
cough-lozenges
and
*NL*
corset-laces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
Zeena
ai
n't
broken
anything
she
sets
store
by
,
''
she
called
after
*NL*
him
as
he
turned
the
greys
toward
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fitful
bursts
of
sleet
had
changed
into
a
steady
rain
and
the
horses
*NL*
had
heavy
work
even
without
a
load
behind
them
.
Once
or
twice
,
hearing
*NL*
sleigh-bells
,
Ethan
turned
his
head
,
fancying
that
Zeena
and
Jotham
*NL*
might
overtake
him
;
but
the
old
sorrel
was
not
in
sight
,
and
he
set
his
*NL*
face
against
the
rain
and
urged
on
his
ponderous
pair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barn
was
empty
when
the
horses
turned
into
it
and
,
after
giving
them
*NL*
the
most
perfunctory
ministrations
they
had
ever
received
from
him
,
he
*NL*
strode
up
to
the
house
and
pushed
open
the
kitchen
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
was
there
alone
,
as
he
had
pictured
her
.
She
was
bending
over
a
*NL*
pan
on
the
stove
;
but
at
the
sound
of
his
step
she
turned
with
a
start
*NL*
and
sprang
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
here
,
Matt
,
I
've
got
some
stuff
to
mend
the
dish
with
!
Let
me
get
*NL*
at
it
quick
,
''
he
cried
,
waving
the
bottle
in
one
hand
while
he
put
her
*NL*
lightly
aside
;
but
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Ethan
--
Zeena
's
come
,
''
she
said
in
a
whisper
,
clutching
his
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
and
stared
at
each
other
,
pale
as
culprits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
sorrel
's
not
in
the
barn
!
''
Ethan
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jotham
Powell
brought
some
goods
over
from
the
Flats
for
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
he
drove
right
on
home
with
them
,
''
she
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
blankly
about
the
kitchen
,
which
looked
cold
and
squalid
in
the
*NL*
rainy
winter
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
she
?
''
he
asked
,
dropping
his
voice
to
Mattie
's
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
away
from
him
uncertainly
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
She
went
right
up
*NL*
to
her
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
n't
say
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
let
out
his
doubts
in
a
low
whistle
and
thrust
the
bottle
back
*NL*
into
his
pocket
.
``
Do
n't
fret
;
I
'll
come
down
and
mend
it
in
the
night
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
He
pulled
on
his
wet
coat
again
and
went
back
to
the
barn
to
*NL*
feed
the
greys
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
there
Jotham
Powell
drove
up
with
the
sleigh
,
and
when
the
*NL*
horses
had
been
attended
to
Ethan
said
to
him
:
``
You
might
as
well
come
*NL*
back
up
for
a
bite
.
''
He
was
not
sorry
to
assure
himself
of
Jotham
's
*NL*
neutralising
presence
at
the
supper
table
,
for
Zeena
was
always
*NL*
``
nervous
''
after
a
journey
.
But
the
hired
man
,
though
seldom
loth
to
*NL*
accept
a
meal
not
included
in
his
wages
,
opened
his
stiff
jaws
to
answer
*NL*
slowly
:
``
I
'm
obliged
to
you
,
but
I
guess
I
'll
go
along
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
looked
at
him
in
surprise
.
``
Better
come
up
and
dry
off
.
Looks
as
*NL*
if
there
'd
be
something
hot
for
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jotham
's
facial
muscles
were
unmoved
by
this
appeal
and
,
his
vocabulary
*NL*
being
limited
,
he
merely
repeated
:
``
I
guess
I
'll
go
along
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Ethan
there
was
something
vaguely
ominous
in
this
stolid
rejection
of
*NL*
free
food
and
warmth
,
and
he
wondered
what
had
happened
on
the
drive
to
*NL*
nerve
Jotham
to
such
stoicism
.
Perhaps
Zeena
had
failed
to
see
the
new
*NL*
doctor
or
had
not
liked
his
counsels
:
Ethan
knew
that
in
such
cases
*NL*
the
first
person
she
met
was
likely
to
be
held
responsible
for
her
*NL*
grievance
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
re-entered
the
kitchen
the
lamp
lit
up
the
same
scene
of
shining
*NL*
comfort
as
on
the
previous
evening
.
The
table
had
been
as
carefully
*NL*
laid
,
a
clear
fire
glowed
in
the
stove
,
the
cat
dozed
in
its
warmth
,
and
*NL*
Mattie
came
forward
carrying
a
plate
of
dough-nuts
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
and
Ethan
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
;
then
she
said
,
as
she
had
*NL*
said
the
night
before
:
``
I
guess
it
's
about
time
for
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
went
out
into
the
passage
to
hang
up
his
wet
garments
.
He
listened
*NL*
for
Zeena
's
step
and
,
not
hearing
it
,
called
her
name
up
the
stairs
.
She
*NL*
did
not
answer
,
and
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
he
went
up
and
opened
*NL*
her
door
.
The
room
was
almost
dark
,
but
in
the
obscurity
he
saw
her
*NL*
sitting
by
the
window
,
bolt
upright
,
and
knew
by
the
rigidity
of
the
*NL*
outline
projected
against
the
pane
that
she
had
not
taken
off
her
*NL*
travelling
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Zeena
,
''
he
ventured
from
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
move
,
and
he
continued
:
``
Supper
's
about
ready
.
Ai
n't
you
*NL*
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
:
``
I
do
n't
feel
as
if
I
could
touch
a
morsel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
consecrated
formula
,
and
he
expected
it
to
be
followed
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
by
her
rising
and
going
down
to
supper
.
But
she
remained
seated
,
*NL*
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
more
felicitous
than
:
``
I
presume
you
're
*NL*
tired
after
the
long
ride
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
her
head
at
this
,
she
answered
solemnly
:
``
I
'm
a
great
deal
*NL*
sicker
than
you
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
words
fell
on
his
ear
with
a
strange
shock
of
wonder
.
He
had
often
*NL*
heard
her
pronounce
them
before
--
what
if
at
last
they
were
true
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
a
step
or
two
into
the
dim
room
.
``
I
hope
that
's
not
so
,
*NL*
Zeena
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
to
gaze
at
him
through
the
twilight
with
a
mien
of
wan
*NL*
authority
,
as
of
one
consciously
singled
out
for
a
great
fate
.
``
I
've
got
*NL*
complications
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
knew
the
word
for
one
of
exceptional
import
.
Almost
everybody
in
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
had
``
troubles
,
''
frankly
localized
and
specified
;
*NL*
but
only
the
chosen
had
``
complications
.
''
To
have
them
was
in
itself
a
*NL*
distinction
,
though
it
was
also
,
in
most
cases
,
a
death-warrant
.
People
*NL*
struggled
on
for
years
with
``
troubles
,
''
but
they
almost
always
succumbed
*NL*
to
``
complications
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
's
heart
was
jerking
to
and
fro
between
two
extremities
of
feeling
,
*NL*
but
for
the
moment
compassion
prevailed
.
His
wife
looked
so
hard
and
*NL*
lonely
,
sitting
there
in
the
darkness
with
such
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
the
new
doctor
told
you
?
''
he
asked
,
instinctively
lowering
*NL*
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
He
says
any
regular
doctor
would
want
me
to
have
an
operation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
was
aware
that
,
in
regard
to
the
important
question
of
surgical
*NL*
intervention
,
the
female
opinion
of
the
neighbourhood
was
divided
,
some
*NL*
glorying
in
the
prestige
conferred
by
operations
while
others
shunned
*NL*
them
as
indelicate
.
Ethan
,
from
motives
of
economy
,
had
always
been
glad
*NL*
that
Zeena
was
of
the
latter
faction
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
agitation
caused
by
the
gravity
of
her
announcement
he
sought
*NL*
a
consolatory
short
cut
.
``
What
do
you
know
about
this
doctor
anyway
?
*NL*
Nobody
ever
told
you
that
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
his
blunder
before
she
could
take
it
up
:
she
wanted
sympathy
,
not
*NL*
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
need
to
have
anybody
tell
me
I
was
losing
ground
every
day
.
*NL*
Everybody
but
you
could
see
it
.
And
everybody
in
Bettsbridge
knows
*NL*
about
Dr.
Buck
.
He
has
his
office
in
Worcester
,
and
comes
over
once
*NL*
a
fortnight
to
Shadd
's
Falls
and
Bettsbridge
for
consultations
.
Eliza
*NL*
Spears
was
wasting
away
with
kidney
trouble
before
she
went
to
him
,
and
*NL*
now
she
's
up
and
around
,
and
singing
in
the
choir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
glad
of
that
.
You
must
do
just
what
he
tells
you
,
''
Ethan
*NL*
answered
sympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
still
looking
at
him
.
``
I
mean
to
,
''
she
said
.
He
was
struck
by
a
*NL*
new
note
in
her
voice
.
It
was
neither
whining
nor
reproachful
,
but
drily
*NL*
resolute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
want
you
should
do
?
''
he
asked
,
with
a
mounting
vision
of
*NL*
fresh
expenses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wants
I
should
have
a
hired
girl
.
He
says
I
ought
n't
to
have
to
do
a
*NL*
single
thing
around
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hired
girl
?
''
Ethan
stood
transfixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
And
Aunt
Martha
found
me
one
right
off
.
Everybody
said
I
was
lucky
*NL*
to
get
a
girl
to
come
away
out
here
,
and
I
agreed
to
give
her
a
dollar
*NL*
extry
to
make
sure
.
She
'll
be
over
to-morrow
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wrath
and
dismay
contended
in
Ethan
.
He
had
foreseen
an
immediate
demand
*NL*
for
money
,
but
not
a
permanent
drain
on
his
scant
resources
.
He
no
*NL*
longer
believed
what
Zeena
had
told
him
of
the
supposed
seriousness
of
*NL*
her
state
:
he
saw
in
her
expedition
to
Bettsbridge
only
a
plot
hatched
*NL*
between
herself
and
her
Pierce
relations
to
foist
on
him
the
cost
of
a
*NL*
servant
;
and
for
the
moment
wrath
predominated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
meant
to
engage
a
girl
you
ought
to
have
told
me
before
you
*NL*
started
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
tell
you
before
I
started
?
How
did
I
know
what
Dr.
Buck
*NL*
would
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Dr.
Buck
--
''
Ethan
's
incredulity
escaped
in
a
short
laugh
.
``
Did
Dr.
*NL*
Buck
tell
you
how
I
was
to
pay
her
wages
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
rose
furiously
with
his
.
``
No
,
he
did
n't
.
For
I
'd
`
a
'
been
*NL*
ashamed
to
tell
him
that
you
grudged
me
the
money
to
get
back
my
health
,
*NL*
when
I
lost
it
nursing
your
own
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
lost
your
health
nursing
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
my
folks
all
told
me
at
the
time
you
could
n't
do
no
less
than
*NL*
marry
me
after
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zeena
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
obscurity
which
hid
their
faces
their
thoughts
seemed
to
*NL*
dart
at
each
other
like
serpents
shooting
venom
.
Ethan
was
seized
*NL*
with
horror
of
the
scene
and
shame
at
his
own
share
in
it
.
It
was
as
*NL*
senseless
and
savage
as
a
physical
fight
between
two
enemies
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
the
shelf
above
the
chimney
,
groped
for
matches
and
lit
the
*NL*
one
candle
in
the
room
.
At
first
its
weak
flame
made
no
impression
on
*NL*
the
shadows
;
then
Zeena
's
face
stood
grimly
out
against
the
uncurtained
*NL*
pane
,
which
had
turned
from
grey
to
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
scene
of
open
anger
between
the
couple
in
their
sad
*NL*
seven
years
together
,
and
Ethan
felt
as
if
he
had
lost
an
irretrievable
*NL*
advantage
in
descending
to
the
level
of
recrimination
.
But
the
practical
*NL*
problem
was
there
and
had
to
be
dealt
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
have
n't
got
the
money
to
pay
for
a
girl
,
Zeena
.
You
'll
have
*NL*
to
send
her
back
:
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
says
it
'll
be
my
death
if
I
go
on
slaving
the
way
I
've
had
*NL*
to
.
He
does
n't
understand
how
I
've
stood
it
as
long
as
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slaving
!
--
''
He
checked
himself
again
,
``
You
sha
'n'
t
lift
a
hand
,
if
he
*NL*
says
so
.
I
'll
do
everything
round
the
house
myself
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
in
:
``
You
're
neglecting
the
farm
enough
already
,
''
and
this
*NL*
being
true
,
he
found
no
answer
,
and
left
her
time
to
add
ironically
:
*NL*
``
Better
send
me
over
to
the
almshouse
and
done
with
it
...
I
guess
*NL*
there
's
been
Fromes
there
afore
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
taunt
burned
into
him
,
but
he
let
it
pass
.
``
I
have
n't
got
the
money
.
*NL*
That
settles
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
's
pause
in
the
struggle
,
as
though
the
combatants
*NL*
were
testing
their
weapons
.
Then
Zeena
said
in
a
level
voice
:
``
I
thought
*NL*
you
were
to
get
fifty
dollars
from
Andrew
Hale
for
that
lumber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
Hale
never
pays
under
three
months
.
''
He
had
hardly
spoken
when
*NL*
he
remembered
the
excuse
he
had
made
for
not
accompanying
his
wife
to
*NL*
the
station
the
day
before
;
and
the
blood
rose
to
his
frowning
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
told
me
yesterday
you
'd
fixed
it
up
with
him
to
pay
cash
down
.
*NL*
You
said
that
was
why
you
could
n't
drive
me
over
to
the
Flats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
had
no
suppleness
in
deceiving
.
He
had
never
before
been
convicted
*NL*
of
a
lie
,
and
all
the
resources
of
evasion
failed
him
.
``
I
guess
that
was
*NL*
a
misunderstanding
,
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ai
n't
got
the
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
ai
n't
going
to
get
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
could
n't
know
that
when
I
engaged
the
girl
,
could
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
He
paused
to
control
his
voice
.
``
But
you
know
it
now
.
I
'm
sorry
,
*NL*
but
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
You
're
a
poor
man
's
wife
,
Zeena
;
but
I
'll
do
the
*NL*
best
I
can
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
while
she
sat
motionless
,
as
if
reflecting
,
her
arms
stretched
*NL*
along
the
arms
of
her
chair
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
.
``
Oh
,
I
guess
*NL*
we
'll
make
out
,
''
she
said
mildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
change
in
her
tone
reassured
him
.
``
Of
course
we
will
!
There
's
a
*NL*
whole
lot
more
I
can
do
for
you
,
and
Mattie
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
,
while
he
spoke
,
seemed
to
be
following
out
some
elaborate
mental
*NL*
calculation
.
She
emerged
from
it
to
say
:
``
There
'll
be
Mattie
's
board
*NL*
less
,
any
how
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
,
supposing
the
discussion
to
be
over
,
had
turned
to
go
down
to
*NL*
supper
.
He
stopped
short
,
not
grasping
what
he
heard
.
``
Mattie
's
board
*NL*
less
--
?
''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
laughed
.
It
was
on
odd
unfamiliar
sound
--
he
did
not
remember
ever
*NL*
having
heard
her
laugh
before
.
``
You
did
n't
suppose
I
was
going
to
keep
*NL*
two
girls
,
did
you
?
No
wonder
you
were
scared
at
the
expense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
had
but
a
confused
sense
of
what
she
was
saying
.
From
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
discussion
he
had
instinctively
avoided
the
mention
of
*NL*
Mattie
's
name
,
fearing
he
hardly
knew
what
:
criticism
,
complaints
,
or
*NL*
vague
allusions
to
the
imminent
probability
of
her
marrying
.
But
the
*NL*
thought
of
a
definite
rupture
had
never
come
to
him
,
and
even
now
could
*NL*
not
lodge
itself
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
''
he
said
.
``
Mattie
Silver
's
not
a
hired
*NL*
girl
.
She
's
your
relation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
pauper
that
's
hung
onto
us
all
after
her
father
'd
done
his
best
*NL*
to
ruin
us
.
I
've
kep
'
her
here
a
whole
year
:
it
's
somebody
else
's
turn
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
shrill
words
shot
out
Ethan
heard
a
tap
on
the
door
,
which
he
had
*NL*
drawn
shut
when
he
turned
back
from
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ethan
--
Zeena
!
''
Mattie
's
voice
sounded
gaily
from
the
landing
,
``
do
you
*NL*
know
what
time
it
is
?
Supper
's
been
ready
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Inside
the
room
there
was
a
moment
's
silence
;
then
Zeena
called
out
from
*NL*
her
seat
:
``
I
'm
not
coming
down
to
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
sorry
!
Are
n't
you
well
?
Sha
'n'
t
I
bring
you
up
a
bite
of
*NL*
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
roused
himself
with
an
effort
and
opened
the
door
.
``
Go
along
down
,
*NL*
Matt
.
Zeena
's
just
a
little
tired
.
I
'm
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
her
``
All
right
!
''
and
her
quick
step
on
the
stairs
;
then
he
*NL*
shut
the
door
and
turned
back
into
the
room
.
His
wife
's
attitude
was
*NL*
unchanged
,
her
face
inexorable
,
and
he
was
seized
with
the
despairing
*NL*
sense
of
his
helplessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ai
n't
going
to
do
it
,
Zeena
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
what
?
''
she
emitted
between
flattened
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
Mattie
away
--
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
bargained
to
take
her
for
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
with
rising
vehemence
:
``
You
ca
n't
put
her
out
of
the
house
*NL*
like
a
thief
--
a
poor
girl
without
friends
or
money
.
She
's
done
her
best
*NL*
for
you
and
she
's
got
no
place
to
go
to
.
You
may
forget
she
's
your
kin
*NL*
but
everybody
else
'll
remember
it
.
If
you
do
a
thing
like
that
what
do
*NL*
you
suppose
folks
'll
say
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
waited
a
moment
,
as
if
giving
him
time
to
feel
the
full
force
*NL*
of
the
contrast
between
his
own
excitement
and
her
composure
.
Then
she
*NL*
replied
in
the
same
smooth
voice
:
``
I
know
well
enough
what
they
say
of
*NL*
my
having
kep
'
her
here
as
long
as
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
's
hand
dropped
from
the
door-knob
,
which
he
had
held
clenched
*NL*
since
he
had
drawn
the
door
shut
on
Mattie
.
His
wife
's
retort
was
like
a
*NL*
knife-cut
across
the
sinews
and
he
felt
suddenly
weak
and
powerless
.
*NL*
He
had
meant
to
humble
himself
,
to
argue
that
Mattie
's
keep
did
n't
cost
*NL*
much
,
after
all
,
that
he
could
make
out
to
buy
a
stove
and
fix
up
a
*NL*
place
in
the
attic
for
the
hired
girl
--
but
Zeena
's
words
revealed
the
*NL*
peril
of
such
pleadings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
tell
her
she
's
got
to
go
--
at
once
?
''
he
faltered
out
,
in
*NL*
terror
of
letting
his
wife
complete
her
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
trying
to
make
him
see
reason
she
replied
impartially
:
``
The
girl
*NL*
will
be
over
from
Bettsbridge
to-morrow
,
and
I
presume
she
's
got
to
have
*NL*
somewheres
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
looked
at
her
with
loathing
.
She
was
no
longer
the
listless
*NL*
creature
who
had
lived
at
his
side
in
a
state
of
sullen
self-absorption
,
*NL*
but
a
mysterious
alien
presence
,
an
evil
energy
secreted
from
the
long
*NL*
years
of
silent
brooding
.
It
was
the
sense
of
his
helplessness
that
*NL*
sharpened
his
antipathy
.
There
had
never
been
anything
in
her
that
*NL*
one
could
appeal
to
;
but
as
long
as
he
could
ignore
and
command
he
had
*NL*
remained
indifferent
.
Now
she
had
mastered
him
and
he
abhorred
her
.
*NL*
Mattie
was
her
relation
,
not
his
:
there
were
no
means
by
which
he
could
*NL*
compel
her
to
keep
the
girl
under
her
roof
.
All
the
long
misery
of
his
*NL*
baffled
past
,
of
his
youth
of
failure
,
hardship
and
vain
effort
,
rose
*NL*
up
in
his
soul
in
bitterness
and
seemed
to
take
shape
before
him
in
the
*NL*
woman
who
at
every
turn
had
barred
his
way
.
She
had
taken
everything
*NL*
else
from
him
;
and
now
she
meant
to
take
the
one
thing
that
made
up
for
*NL*
all
the
others
.
For
a
moment
such
a
flame
of
hate
rose
in
him
that
it
*NL*
ran
down
his
arm
and
clenched
his
fist
against
her
.
He
took
a
wild
step
*NL*
forward
and
then
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
--
you
're
not
coming
down
?
''
he
said
in
a
bewildered
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
guess
I
'll
lay
down
on
the
bed
a
little
while
,
''
she
answered
*NL*
mildly
;
and
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
kitchen
Mattie
was
sitting
by
the
stove
,
the
cat
curled
up
on
her
*NL*
knees
.
She
sprang
to
her
feet
as
Ethan
entered
and
carried
the
covered
*NL*
dish
of
meat-pie
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
Zeena
is
n't
sick
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shone
at
him
across
the
table
.
``
Well
,
sit
right
down
then
.
You
must
*NL*
be
starving
.
''
She
uncovered
the
pie
and
pushed
it
over
to
him
.
So
they
*NL*
were
to
have
one
more
evening
together
,
her
happy
eyes
seemed
to
say
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
helped
himself
mechanically
and
began
to
eat
;
then
disgust
took
him
*NL*
by
the
throat
and
he
laid
down
his
fork
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
's
tender
gaze
was
on
him
and
she
marked
the
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Ethan
,
what
's
the
matter
?
Do
n't
it
taste
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
it
's
first-rate
.
Only
I
--
''
He
pushed
his
plate
away
,
rose
from
his
*NL*
chair
,
and
walked
around
the
table
to
her
side
.
She
started
up
with
*NL*
frightened
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ethan
,
there
's
something
wrong
!
I
knew
there
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
melt
against
him
in
her
terror
,
and
he
caught
her
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
held
her
fast
there
,
felt
her
lashes
beat
his
cheek
like
netted
*NL*
butterflies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
--
what
is
it
?
''
she
stammered
;
but
he
had
found
her
lips
at
*NL*
last
and
was
drinking
unconsciousness
of
everything
but
the
joy
they
*NL*
gave
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lingered
a
moment
,
caught
in
the
same
strong
current
;
then
she
*NL*
slipped
from
him
and
drew
back
a
step
or
two
,
pale
and
troubled
.
Her
*NL*
look
smote
him
with
compunction
,
and
he
cried
out
,
as
if
he
saw
her
*NL*
drowning
in
a
dream
:
``
You
ca
n't
go
,
Matt
!
I
'll
never
let
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
--
go
?
''
she
stammered
.
``
Must
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
went
on
sounding
between
them
as
though
a
torch
of
warning
*NL*
flew
from
hand
to
hand
through
a
black
landscape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
was
overcome
with
shame
at
his
lack
of
self-control
in
flinging
*NL*
the
news
at
her
so
brutally
.
His
head
reeled
and
he
had
to
support
*NL*
himself
against
the
table
.
All
the
while
he
felt
as
if
he
were
still
*NL*
kissing
her
,
and
yet
dying
of
thirst
for
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ethan
,
what
has
happened
?
Is
Zeena
mad
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
cry
steadied
him
,
though
it
deepened
his
wrath
and
pity
.
``
No
,
no
,
''
*NL*
he
assured
her
,
``
it
's
not
that
.
But
this
new
doctor
has
scared
her
about
*NL*
herself
.
You
know
she
believes
all
they
say
the
first
time
she
sees
*NL*
them
.
And
this
one
's
told
her
she
wo
n't
get
well
unless
she
lays
up
and
*NL*
do
n't
do
a
thing
about
the
house
--
not
for
months
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
his
eyes
wandering
from
her
miserably
.
She
stood
silent
a
*NL*
moment
,
drooping
before
him
like
a
broken
branch
.
She
was
so
small
and
*NL*
weak-looking
that
it
wrung
his
heart
;
but
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
*NL*
and
looked
straight
at
him
.
``
And
she
wants
somebody
handier
in
my
place
?
*NL*
Is
that
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
she
says
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
says
it
to-night
she
'll
say
it
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
bowed
to
the
inexorable
truth
:
they
knew
that
Zeena
never
changed
*NL*
her
mind
,
and
that
in
her
case
a
resolve
once
taken
was
equivalent
to
an
*NL*
act
performed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
silence
between
them
;
then
Mattie
said
in
a
low
voice
:
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
too
sorry
,
Ethan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
God
--
oh
,
God
,
''
he
groaned
.
The
glow
of
passion
he
had
felt
for
her
*NL*
had
melted
to
an
aching
tenderness
.
He
saw
her
quick
lids
beating
back
*NL*
the
tears
,
and
longed
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
soothe
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
letting
your
supper
get
cold
,
''
she
admonished
him
with
a
pale
*NL*
gleam
of
gaiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Matt
--
Matt
--
where
'll
you
go
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lids
sank
and
a
tremor
crossed
her
face
.
He
saw
that
for
the
first
*NL*
time
the
thought
of
the
future
came
to
her
distinctly
.
``
I
might
get
*NL*
something
to
do
over
at
Stamford
,
''
she
faltered
,
as
if
knowing
that
he
*NL*
knew
she
had
no
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
back
into
his
seat
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
.
Despair
*NL*
seized
him
at
the
thought
of
her
setting
out
alone
to
renew
the
weary
*NL*
quest
for
work
.
In
the
only
place
where
she
was
known
she
was
surrounded
*NL*
by
indifference
or
animosity
;
and
what
chance
had
she
,
inexperienced
*NL*
and
untrained
,
among
the
million
bread-seekers
of
the
cities
?
There
came
*NL*
back
to
him
miserable
tales
he
had
heard
at
Worcester
,
and
the
faces
*NL*
of
girls
whose
lives
had
begun
as
hopefully
as
Mattie
's
...
It
was
not
*NL*
possible
to
think
of
such
things
without
a
revolt
of
his
whole
being
.
He
*NL*
sprang
up
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
go
,
Matt
!
I
wo
n't
let
you
!
She
's
always
had
her
way
,
but
I
*NL*
mean
to
have
mine
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
lifted
her
hand
with
a
quick
gesture
,
and
he
heard
his
wife
's
*NL*
step
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
came
into
the
room
with
her
dragging
down-at-the-heel
step
,
and
*NL*
quietly
took
her
accustomed
seat
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
a
little
mite
better
,
and
Dr.
Buck
says
I
ought
to
eat
all
I
can
*NL*
to
keep
my
strength
up
,
even
if
I
ai
n't
got
any
appetite
,
''
she
said
in
*NL*
her
flat
whine
,
reaching
across
Mattie
for
the
teapot
.
Her
``
good
''
dress
*NL*
had
been
replaced
by
the
black
calico
and
brown
knitted
shawl
which
*NL*
formed
her
daily
wear
,
and
with
them
she
had
put
on
her
usual
face
and
*NL*
manner
.
She
poured
out
her
tea
,
added
a
great
deal
of
milk
to
it
,
helped
*NL*
herself
largely
to
pie
and
pickles
,
and
made
the
familiar
gesture
of
*NL*
adjusting
her
false
teeth
before
she
began
to
eat
.
The
cat
rubbed
itself
*NL*
ingratiatingly
against
her
,
and
she
said
``
Good
Pussy
,
''
stooped
to
stroke
*NL*
it
and
gave
it
a
scrap
of
meat
from
her
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
sat
speechless
,
not
pretending
to
eat
,
but
Mattie
nibbled
*NL*
valiantly
at
her
food
and
asked
Zeena
one
or
two
questions
about
her
*NL*
visit
to
Bettsbridge
.
Zeena
answered
in
her
every-day
tone
and
,
warming
*NL*
to
the
theme
,
regaled
them
with
several
vivid
descriptions
of
intestinal
*NL*
disturbances
among
her
friends
and
relatives
.
She
looked
straight
at
*NL*
Mattie
as
she
spoke
,
a
faint
smile
deepening
the
vertical
lines
between
*NL*
her
nose
and
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
supper
was
over
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
pressed
her
hand
to
the
*NL*
flat
surface
over
the
region
of
her
heart
.
``
That
pie
of
yours
always
*NL*
sets
a
mite
heavy
,
Matt
,
''
she
said
,
not
ill-naturedly
.
She
seldom
*NL*
abbreviated
the
girl
's
name
,
and
when
she
did
so
it
was
always
a
sign
of
*NL*
affability
.

*NL*
``
I
've
a
good
mind
to
go
and
hunt
up
those
stomach
powders
I
got
last
*NL*
year
over
in
Springfield
,
''
she
continued
.
``
I
ai
n't
tried
them
for
quite
*NL*
a
while
,
and
maybe
they
'll
help
the

*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
lifted
her
eyes
.
``
Ca
n't
I
get
them
for
you
,
Zeena
?
''
she
ventured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
They
're
in
a
place
you
do
n't
know
about
,
''
Zeena
answered
darkly
,
*NL*
with
one
of
her
secret
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
out
of
the
kitchen
and
Mattie
,
rising
,
began
to
clear
the
*NL*
dishes
from
the
table
.
As
she
passed
Ethan
's
chair
their
eyes
met
and
*NL*
clung
together
desolately
.
The
warm
still
kitchen
looked
as
peaceful
as
*NL*
the
night
before
.
The
cat
had
sprung
to
Zeena
's
rocking-chair
,
and
the
*NL*
heat
of
the
fire
was
beginning
to
draw
out
the
faint
sharp
scent
of
the
*NL*
geraniums
.
Ethan
dragged
himself
wearily
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
out
and
take
a
look
around
,
''
he
said
,
going
toward
the
passage
*NL*
to
get
his
lantern
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
reached
the
door
he
met
Zeena
coming
back
into
the
room
,
her
lips
*NL*
twitching
with
anger
,
a
flush
of
excitement
on
her
sallow
face
.
*NL*
The
shawl
had
slipped
from
her
shoulders
and
was
dragging
at
her
*NL*
down-trodden
heels
,
and
in
her
hands
she
carried
the
fragments
of
the
*NL*
red
glass
pickle-dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
know
who
done
this
,
''
she
said
,
looking
sternly
from
Ethan
*NL*
to
Mattie
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
,
and
she
continued
in
a
trembling
voice
:
``
I
went
to
*NL*
get
those
powders
I
'd
put
away
in
father
's
old
spectacle-case
,
top
of
*NL*
the
china-closet
,
where
I
keep
the
things
I
set
store
by
,
so
's
folks
*NL*
sha
n't
meddle
with
them
--
''
Her
voice
broke
,
and
two
small
tears
hung
*NL*
on
her
lashless
lids
and
ran
slowly
down
her
cheeks
.
``
It
takes
the
*NL*
stepladder
to
get
at
the
top
shelf
,
and
I
put
Aunt
Philura
Maple
's
*NL*
pickle-dish
up
there
o
'
purpose
when
we
was
married
,
and
it
's
never
been
*NL*
down
since
,
`
cept
for
the
spring
cleaning
,
and
then
I
always
lifted
it
*NL*
with
my
own
hands
,
so
's
'
t
it
should
n't
get
broke
.
''
She
laid
the
fragments
*NL*
reverently
on
the
table
.
``
I
want
to
know
who
done
this
,
''
she
quavered
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
challenge
Ethan
turned
back
into
the
room
and
faced
her
.
``
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
,
then
.
The
cat
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
hard
,
and
then
turned
her
eyes
to
Mattie
,
who
was
*NL*
carrying
the
dish-pan
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
know
how
the
cat
got
into
my
china-closet
''
'
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chasin
'
mice
,
I
guess
,
''
Ethan
rejoined
.
``
There
was
a
mouse
round
the
*NL*
kitchen
all
last
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
continued
to
look
from
one
to
the
other
;
then
she
emitted
her
*NL*
small
strange
laugh
.
``
I
knew
the
cat
was
a
smart
cat
,
''
she
said
in
a
*NL*
high
voice
,
``
but
I
did
n't
know
he
was
smart
enough
to
pick
up
the
pieces
*NL*
of
my
pickle-dish
and
lay
'em
edge
to
edge
on
the
very
shelf
he
knocked
*NL*
'em
off
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
suddenly
drew
her
arms
out
of
the
steaming
water
.
``
It
was
n't
*NL*
Ethan
's
fault
,
Zeena
!
The
cat
did
break
the
dish
;
but
I
got
it
down
from
*NL*
the
china-closet
,
and
I
'm
the
one
to
blame
for
its
getting
broken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
stood
beside
the
ruin
of
her
treasure
,
stiffening
into
a
stony
*NL*
image
of
resentment
,
``
You
got
down
my
pickle-dish-what
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bright
flush
flew
to
Mattie
's
cheeks
.
``
I
wanted
to
make
the
*NL*
supper-table
pretty
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wanted
to
make
the
supper-table
pretty
;
and
you
waited
till
my
back
*NL*
was
turned
,
and
took
the
thing
I
set
most
store
by
of
anything
I
've
got
,
*NL*
and
would
n't
never
use
it
,
not
even
when
the
minister
come
to
dinner
,
*NL*
or
Aunt
Martha
Pierce
come
over
from
Bettsbridge
--
''
Zeena
paused
with
a
*NL*
gasp
,
as
if
terrified
by
her
own
evocation
of
the
sacrilege
.
``
You
're
a
*NL*
bad
girl
,
Mattie
Silver
,
and
I
always
known
it
.
It
's
the
way
your
father
*NL*
begun
,
and
I
was
warned
of
it
when
I
took
you
,
and
I
tried
to
keep
my
*NL*
things
where
you
could
n't
get
at
'em
--
and
now
you
've
took
from
me
the
one
*NL*
I
cared
for
most
of
all
--
''
She
broke
off
in
a
short
spasm
of
sobs
that
*NL*
passed
and
left
her
more
than
ever
like
a
shape
of
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
'd
`
a
'
listened
to
folks
,
you
'd
`
a
'
gone
before
now
,
and
this
*NL*
would
n't
`
a
'
happened
,
''
she
said
;
and
gathering
up
the
bits
of
broken
*NL*
glass
she
went
out
of
the
room
as
if
she
carried
a
dead
body
...
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Ethan
was
called
back
to
the
farm
by
his
father
's
illness
his
*NL*
mother
gave
him
,
for
his
own
use
,
a
small
room
behind
the
untenanted
*NL*
``
best
parlour
.
''
Here
he
had
nailed
up
shelves
for
his
books
,
built
*NL*
himself
a
box-sofa
out
of
boards
and
a
mattress
,
laid
out
his
papers
on
*NL*
a
kitchen-table
,
hung
on
the
rough
plaster
wall
an
engraving
of
Abraham
*NL*
Lincoln
and
a
calendar
with
``
Thoughts
from
the
Poets
,
''
and
tried
,
with
*NL*
these
meagre
properties
,
to
produce
some
likeness
to
the
study
of
a
*NL*
``
minister
''
who
had
been
kind
to
him
and
lent
him
books
when
he
was
at
*NL*
Worcester
.
He
still
took
refuge
there
in
summer
,
but
when
Mattie
came
to
*NL*
live
at
the
farm
he
had
to
give
her
his
stove
,
and
consequently
the
room
*NL*
was
uninhabitable
for
several
months
of
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
retreat
he
descended
as
soon
as
the
house
was
quiet
,
and
Zeena
's
*NL*
steady
breathing
from
the
bed
had
assured
him
that
there
was
to
be
*NL*
no
sequel
to
the
scene
in
the
kitchen
.
After
Zeena
's
departure
he
and
*NL*
Mattie
had
stood
speechless
,
neither
seeking
to
approach
the
other
.
Then
*NL*
the
girl
had
returned
to
her
task
of
clearing
up
the
kitchen
for
the
*NL*
night
and
he
had
taken
his
lantern
and
gone
on
his
usual
round
outside
*NL*
the
house
.
The
kitchen
was
empty
when
he
came
back
to
it
;
but
his
*NL*
tobacco-pouch
and
pipe
had
been
laid
on
the
table
,
and
under
them
was
*NL*
a
scrap
of
paper
torn
from
the
back
of
a
seedsman
's
catalogue
,
on
which
*NL*
three
words
were
written
:
``
Do
n't
trouble
,
Ethan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Going
into
his
cold
dark
``
study
''
he
placed
the
lantern
on
the
table
*NL*
and
,
stooping
to
its
light
,
read
the
message
again
and
again
.
It
was
the
*NL*
first
time
that
Mattie
had
ever
written
to
him
,
and
the
possession
of
*NL*
the
paper
gave
him
a
strange
new
sense
of
her
nearness
;
yet
it
deepened
*NL*
his
anguish
by
reminding
him
that
henceforth
they
would
have
no
other
*NL*
way
of
communicating
with
each
other
.
For
the
life
of
her
smile
,
the
*NL*
warmth
of
her
voice
,
only
cold
paper
and
dead
words
!
*NL*
*NL*
Confused
motions
of
rebellion
stormed
in
him
.
He
was
too
young
,
too
*NL*
strong
,
too
full
of
the
sap
of
living
,
to
submit
so
easily
to
the
*NL*
destruction
of
his
hopes
.
Must
he
wear
out
all
his
years
at
the
side
*NL*
of
a
bitter
querulous
woman
?
Other
possibilities
had
been
in
him
,
*NL*
possibilities
sacrificed
,
one
by
one
,
to
Zeena
's
narrow-mindedness
*NL*
and
ignorance
.
And
what
good
had
come
of
it
?
She
was
a
hundred
times
*NL*
bitterer
and
more
discontented
than
when
he
had
married
her
:
the
one
*NL*
pleasure
left
her
was
to
inflict
pain
on
him
.
All
the
healthy
instincts
*NL*
of
self-defence
rose
up
in
him
against
such
waste
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
bundled
himself
into
his
old
coon-skin
coat
and
lay
down
on
the
*NL*
box-sofa
to
think
.
Under
his
cheek
he
felt
a
hard
object
with
strange
*NL*
protuberances
.
It
was
a
cushion
which
Zeena
had
made
for
him
when
they
*NL*
were
engaged
--
the
only
piece
of
needlework
he
had
ever
seen
her
do
.
He
*NL*
flung
it
across
the
floor
and
propped
his
head
against
the
wall
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
a
case
of
a
man
over
the
mountain
--
a
young
fellow
of
about
his
*NL*
own
age
--
who
had
escaped
from
just
such
a
life
of
misery
by
going
West
*NL*
with
the
girl
he
cared
for
.
His
wife
had
divorced
him
,
and
he
had
*NL*
married
the
girl
and
prospered
.
Ethan
had
seen
the
couple
the
summer
*NL*
before
at
Shadd
's
Falls
,
where
they
had
come
to
visit
relatives
.
They
*NL*
had
a
little
girl
with
fair
curls
,
who
wore
a
gold
locket
and
was
*NL*
dressed
like
a
princess
.
The
deserted
wife
had
not
done
badly
either
.
*NL*
Her
husband
had
given
her
the
farm
and
she
had
managed
to
sell
it
,
and
*NL*
with
that
and
the
alimony
she
had
started
a
lunch-room
at
Bettsbridge
*NL*
and
bloomed
into
activity
and
importance
.
Ethan
was
fired
by
the
*NL*
thought
.
Why
should
he
not
leave
with
Mattie
the
next
day
,
instead
of
*NL*
letting
her
go
alone
?
He
would
hide
his
valise
under
the
seat
of
the
*NL*
sleigh
,
and
Zeena
would
suspect
nothing
till
she
went
upstairs
for
her
*NL*
afternoon
nap
and
found
a
letter
on
the
bed
...
*NL*
*NL*
His
impulses
were
still
near
the
surface
,
and
he
sprang
up
,
re-lit
the
*NL*
lantern
,
and
sat
down
at
the
table
.
He
rummaged
in
the
drawer
for
a
*NL*
sheet
of
paper
,
found
one
,
and
began
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zeena
,
I
've
done
all
I
could
for
you
,
and
I
do
n't
see
as
it
's
been
any
*NL*
use
.
I
do
n't
blame
you
,
nor
I
do
n't
blame
myself
.
Maybe
both
of
us
will
*NL*
do
better
separate
.
I
'm
going
to
try
my
luck
West
,
and
you
can
sell
the
*NL*
farm
and
mill
,
and
keep
the
money
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
pen
paused
on
the
word
,
which
brought
home
to
him
the
relentless
*NL*
conditions
of
his
lot
.
If
he
gave
the
farm
and
mill
to
Zeena
what
would
*NL*
be
left
him
to
start
his
own
life
with
?
Once
in
the
West
he
was
sure
of
*NL*
picking
up
work
--
he
would
not
have
feared
to
try
his
chance
alone
.
But
*NL*
with
Mattie
depending
on
him
the
case
was
different
.
And
what
of
Zeena
's
*NL*
fate
?
Farm
and
mill
were
mortgaged
to
the
limit
of
their
value
,
and
even
*NL*
if
she
found
a
purchaser
--
in
itself
an
unlikely
chance
--
it
was
doubtful
if
*NL*
she
could
clear
a
thousand
dollars
on
the
sale
.
Meanwhile
,
how
could
*NL*
she
keep
the
farm
going
?
It
was
only
by
incessant
labour
and
personal
*NL*
supervision
that
Ethan
drew
a
meagre
living
from
his
land
,
and
his
wife
,
*NL*
even
if
she
were
in
better
health
than
she
imagined
,
could
never
carry
*NL*
such
a
burden
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
she
could
go
back
to
her
people
,
then
,
and
see
what
they
would
do
*NL*
for
her
.
It
was
the
fate
she
was
forcing
on
Mattie
--
why
not
let
her
try
*NL*
it
herself
?
By
the
time
she
had
discovered
his
whereabouts
,
and
brought
*NL*
suit
for
divorce
,
he
would
probably
--
wherever
he
was
--
be
earning
enough
to
*NL*
pay
her
a
sufficient
alimony
.
And
the
alternative
was
to
let
Mattie
go
*NL*
forth
alone
,
with
far
less
hope
of
ultimate
provision
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scattered
the
contents
of
the
table-drawer
in
his
search
for
a
*NL*
sheet
of
paper
,
and
as
he
took
up
his
pen
his
eye
fell
on
an
old
copy
of
*NL*
the
Bettsbridge
Eagle
.
The
advertising
sheet
was
folded
uppermost
,
and
*NL*
he
read
the
seductive
words
:
``
Trips
to
the
West
:
Reduced
Rates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
the
lantern
nearer
and
eagerly
scanned
the
fares
;
then
the
paper
*NL*
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
pushed
aside
his
unfinished
letter
.
A
moment
*NL*
ago
he
had
wondered
what
he
and
Mattie
were
to
live
on
when
they
reached
*NL*
the
West
;
now
he
saw
that
he
had
not
even
the
money
to
take
her
there
.
*NL*
Borrowing
was
out
of
the
question
:
six
months
before
he
had
given
his
*NL*
only
security
to
raise
funds
for
necessary
repairs
to
the
mill
,
and
*NL*
he
knew
that
without
security
no
one
at
Starkfield
would
lend
him
ten
*NL*
dollars
.
The
inexorable
facts
closed
in
on
him
like
prison-warders
*NL*
handcuffing
a
convict
.
There
was
no
way
out
--
none
.
He
was
a
prisoner
for
*NL*
life
,
and
now
his
one
ray
of
light
was
to
be
extinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crept
back
heavily
to
the
sofa
,
stretching
himself
out
with
limbs
so
*NL*
leaden
that
he
felt
as
if
they
would
never
move
again
.
Tears
rose
in
his
*NL*
throat
and
slowly
burned
their
way
to
his
lids
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
lay
there
,
the
window-pane
that
faced
him
,
growing
gradually
*NL*
lighter
,
inlaid
upon
the
darkness
a
square
of
moon-suffused
sky
.
A
*NL*
crooked
tree-branch
crossed
it
,
a
branch
of
the
apple-tree
under
which
,
*NL*
on
summer
evenings
,
he
had
sometimes
found
Mattie
sitting
when
he
came
*NL*
up
from
the
mill
.
Slowly
the
rim
of
the
rainy
vapours
caught
fire
and
*NL*
burnt
away
,
and
a
pure
moon
swung
into
the
blue
.
Ethan
,
rising
on
his
*NL*
elbow
,
watched
the
landscape
whiten
and
shape
itself
under
the
sculpture
*NL*
of
the
moon
.
This
was
the
night
on
which
he
was
to
have
taken
Mattie
*NL*
coasting
,
and
there
hung
the
lamp
to
light
them
!
He
looked
out
at
the
*NL*
slopes
bathed
in
lustre
,
the
silver-edged
darkness
of
the
woods
,
the
*NL*
spectral
purple
of
the
hills
against
the
sky
,
and
it
seemed
as
*NL*
though
all
the
beauty
of
the
night
had
been
poured
out
to
mock
his
*NL*
wretchedness
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
fell
asleep
,
and
when
he
woke
the
chill
of
the
winter
dawn
was
in
the
*NL*
room
.
He
felt
cold
and
stiff
and
hungry
,
and
ashamed
of
being
hungry
.
*NL*
He
rubbed
his
eyes
and
went
to
the
window
.
A
red
sun
stood
over
the
grey
*NL*
rim
of
the
fields
,
behind
trees
that
looked
black
and
brittle
.
He
said
*NL*
to
himself
:
``
This
is
Matt
's
last
day
,
''
and
tried
to
think
what
the
place
*NL*
would
be
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
stood
there
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
and
she
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Ethan
--
were
you
here
all
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
so
small
and
pinched
,
in
her
poor
dress
,
with
the
red
scarf
*NL*
wound
about
her
,
and
the
cold
light
turning
her
paleness
sallow
,
that
*NL*
Ethan
stood
before
her
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
frozen
,
''
she
went
on
,
fixing
lustreless
eyes
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
a
step
nearer
.
``
How
did
you
know
I
was
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
heard
you
go
down
stairs
again
after
I
went
to
bed
,
and
I
*NL*
listened
all
night
,
and
you
did
n't
come
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
his
tenderness
rushed
to
his
lips
.
He
looked
at
her
and
said
:
``
I
'll
*NL*
come
right
along
and
make
up
the
kitchen
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
back
to
the
kitchen
,
and
he
fetched
the
coal
and
kindlings
*NL*
and
cleared
out
the
stove
for
her
,
while
she
brought
in
the
milk
and
*NL*
the
cold
remains
of
the
meat-pie
.
When
warmth
began
to
radiate
from
the
*NL*
stove
,
and
the
first
ray
of
sunlight
lay
on
the
kitchen
floor
,
Ethan
's
*NL*
dark
thoughts
melted
in
the
mellower
air
.
The
sight
of
Mattie
going
*NL*
about
her
work
as
he
had
seen
her
on
so
many
mornings
made
it
seem
*NL*
impossible
that
she
should
ever
cease
to
be
a
part
of
the
scene
.
He
said
*NL*
to
himself
that
he
had
doubtless
exaggerated
the
significance
of
Zeena
's
*NL*
threats
,
and
that
she
too
,
with
the
return
of
daylight
,
would
come
to
a
*NL*
saner
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
to
Mattie
as
she
bent
above
the
stove
,
and
laid
his
hand
on
*NL*
her
arm
.
``
I
do
n't
want
you
should
trouble
either
,
''
he
said
,
looking
down
*NL*
into
her
eyes
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
up
warmly
and
whispered
back
:
``
No
,
Ethan
,
I
ai
n't
going
to
*NL*
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
things
'll
straighten
out
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
but
a
quick
throb
of
her
lids
,
and
he
went
on
:
``
She
*NL*
ai
n't
said
anything
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
have
n't
seen
her
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
take
any
notice
when
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
injunction
he
left
her
and
went
out
to
the
cow-barn
.
He
saw
*NL*
Jotham
Powell
walking
up
the
hill
through
the
morning
mist
,
and
the
*NL*
familiar
sight
added
to
his
growing
conviction
of
security
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
two
men
were
clearing
out
the
stalls
Jotham
rested
on
his
*NL*
pitch-fork
to
say
:
``
Dan
'
l
Byrne
's
goin
'
over
to
the
Flats
to-day
noon
,
*NL*
an
'
he
c
'd
take
Mattie
's
trunk
along
,
and
make
it
easier
ridin
'
when
I
*NL*
take
her
over
in
the
sleigh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
looked
at
him
blankly
,
and
he
continued
:
``
Mis
'
Frome
said
the
new
*NL*
girl
'd
be
at
the
Flats
at
five
,
and
I
was
to
take
Mattie
then
,
so
's
'
t
*NL*
she
could
ketch
the
six
o'clock
train
for
Stamford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
felt
the
blood
drumming
in
his
temples
.
He
had
to
wait
a
moment
*NL*
before
he
could
find
voice
to
say
:
``
Oh
,
it
ai
n't
so
sure
about
Mattie
's
*NL*
going
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
so
?
''
said
Jotham
indifferently
;
and
they
went
on
with
their
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
returned
to
the
kitchen
the
two
women
were
already
at
*NL*
breakfast
.
Zeena
had
an
air
of
unusual
alertness
and
activity
.
She
drank
*NL*
two
cups
of
coffee
and
fed
the
cat
with
the
scraps
left
in
the
pie-dish
;
*NL*
then
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
,
walking
over
to
the
window
,
snipped
two
*NL*
or
three
yellow
leaves
from
the
geraniums
.
``
Aunt
Martha
's
ai
n't
got
a
*NL*
faded
leaf
on
'em
;
but
they
pine
away
when
they
ai
n't
cared
for
,
''
she
*NL*
said
reflectively
.
Then
she
turned
to
Jotham
and
asked
:
``
What
time
'd
you
*NL*
say
Dan
'
l
Byrne
'd
be
along
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hired
man
threw
a
hesitating
glance
at
Ethan
.
``
Round
about
noon
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
turned
to
Mattie
.
``
That
trunk
of
yours
is
too
heavy
for
the
*NL*
sleigh
,
and
Dan
'
l
Byrne
'll
be
round
to
take
it
over
to
the
Flats
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
,
Zeena
,
''
said
Mattie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
go
over
things
with
you
first
,
''
Zeena
continued
in
an
*NL*
unperturbed
voice
.
``
I
know
there
's
a
huckabuck
towel
missing
;
and
I
*NL*
ca
n't
make
out
what
you
done
with
that
match-safe
'
t
used
to
stand
*NL*
behind
the
stuffed
owl
in
the
parlour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
out
,
followed
by
Mattie
,
and
when
the
men
were
alone
Jotham
*NL*
said
to
his
employer
:
``
I
guess
I
better
let
Dan
'
l
come
round
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
finished
his
usual
morning
tasks
about
the
house
and
barn
;
then
*NL*
he
said
to
Jotham
:
``
I
'm
going
down
to
Starkfield
.
Tell
them
not
to
wait
*NL*
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
passion
of
rebellion
had
broken
out
in
him
again
.
That
which
had
*NL*
seemed
incredible
in
the
sober
light
of
day
had
really
come
to
pass
,
*NL*
and
he
was
to
assist
as
a
helpless
spectator
at
Mattie
's
banishment
.
*NL*
His
manhood
was
humbled
by
the
part
he
was
compelled
to
play
and
by
the
*NL*
thought
of
what
Mattie
must
think
of
him
.
Confused
impulses
struggled
*NL*
in
him
as
he
strode
along
to
the
village
.
He
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
*NL*
something
,
but
he
did
not
know
what
it
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
early
mist
had
vanished
and
the
fields
lay
like
a
silver
shield
*NL*
under
the
sun
.
It
was
one
of
the
days
when
the
glitter
of
winter
shines
*NL*
through
a
pale
haze
of
spring
.
Every
yard
of
the
road
was
alive
with
*NL*
Mattie
's
presence
,
and
there
was
hardly
a
branch
against
the
sky
or
a
*NL*
tangle
of
brambles
on
the
bank
in
which
some
bright
shred
of
memory
was
*NL*
not
caught
.
Once
,
in
the
stillness
,
the
call
of
a
bird
in
a
mountain
ash
*NL*
was
so
like
her
laughter
that
his
heart
tightened
and
then
grew
large
;
*NL*
and
all
these
things
made
him
see
that
something
must
be
done
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
Andrew
Hale
,
who
was
a
kind-hearted
*NL*
man
,
might
be
induced
to
reconsider
his
refusal
and
advance
a
small
sum
*NL*
on
the
lumber
if
he
were
told
that
Zeena
's
ill-health
made
it
necessary
*NL*
to
hire
a
servant
.
Hale
,
after
all
,
knew
enough
of
Ethan
's
situation
*NL*
to
make
it
possible
for
the
latter
to
renew
his
appeal
without
too
much
*NL*
loss
of
pride
;
and
,
moreover
,
how
much
did
pride
count
in
the
ebullition
*NL*
of
passions
in
his
breast
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
he
considered
his
plan
the
more
hopeful
it
seemed
.
If
he
could
*NL*
get
Mrs.
Hale
's
ear
he
felt
certain
of
success
,
and
with
fifty
dollars
*NL*
in
his
pocket
nothing
could
keep
him
from
Mattie
...
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
object
was
to
reach
Starkfield
before
Hale
had
started
for
*NL*
his
work
;
he
knew
the
carpenter
had
a
job
down
the
Corbury
road
and
was
*NL*
likely
to
leave
his
house
early
.
Ethan
's
long
strides
grew
more
rapid
*NL*
with
the
accelerated
beat
of
his
thoughts
,
and
as
he
reached
the
foot
of
*NL*
School
House
Hill
he
caught
sight
of
Hale
's
sleigh
in
the
distance
.
He
*NL*
hurried
forward
to
meet
it
,
but
as
it
drew
nearer
he
saw
that
it
was
*NL*
driven
by
the
carpenter
's
youngest
boy
and
that
the
figure
at
his
side
,
*NL*
looking
like
a
large
upright
cocoon
in
spectacles
,
was
that
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Hale
.
Ethan
signed
to
them
to
stop
,
and
Mrs.
Hale
leaned
forward
,
her
*NL*
pink
wrinkles
twinkling
with
benevolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Hale
?
Why
,
yes
,
you
'll
find
him
down
home
now
.
He
ai
n't
going
to
*NL*
his
work
this
forenoon
.
He
woke
up
with
a
touch
o
'
lumbago
,
and
I
just
*NL*
made
him
put
on
one
of
old
Dr.
Kidder
's
plasters
and
set
right
up
into
*NL*
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beaming
maternally
on
Ethan
,
she
bent
over
to
add
:
``
I
on
'
y
just
heard
*NL*
from
Mr.
Hale
`
bout
Zeena
's
going
over
to
Bettsbridge
to
see
that
new
*NL*
doctor
.
I
'm
real
sorry
she
's
feeling
so
bad
again
!
I
hope
he
thinks
he
*NL*
can
do
something
for
her
.
I
do
n't
know
anybody
round
here
's
had
more
*NL*
sickness
than
Zeena
.
I
always
tell
Mr.
Hale
I
do
n't
know
what
she
'd
`
a
'
*NL*
done
if
she
had
n't
`
a
'
had
you
to
look
after
her
;
and
I
used
to
say
*NL*
the
same
thing
`
bout
your
mother
.
You
've
had
an
awful
mean
time
,
Ethan
*NL*
Frome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
a
last
nod
of
sympathy
while
her
son
chirped
to
the
horse
;
*NL*
and
Ethan
,
as
she
drove
off
,
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
stared
*NL*
after
the
retreating
sleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
time
since
any
one
had
spoken
to
him
as
kindly
as
Mrs.
*NL*
Hale
.
Most
people
were
either
indifferent
to
his
troubles
,
or
disposed
*NL*
to
think
it
natural
that
a
young
fellow
of
his
age
should
have
carried
*NL*
without
repining
the
burden
of
three
crippled
lives
.
But
Mrs.
Hale
had
*NL*
said
,
``
You
've
had
an
awful
mean
time
,
Ethan
Frome
,
''
and
he
felt
less
*NL*
alone
with
his
misery
.
If
the
Hales
were
sorry
for
him
they
would
surely
*NL*
respond
to
his
appeal
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
down
the
road
toward
their
house
,
but
at
the
end
of
a
few
*NL*
yards
he
pulled
up
sharply
,
the
blood
in
his
face
.
For
the
first
time
,
*NL*
in
the
light
of
the
words
he
had
just
heard
,
he
saw
what
he
was
about
to
*NL*
do
.
He
was
planning
to
take
advantage
of
the
Hales
'
sympathy
to
obtain
*NL*
money
from
them
on
false
pretences
.
That
was
a
plain
statement
of
the
*NL*
cloudy
purpose
which
had
driven
him
in
headlong
to
Starkfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
sudden
perception
of
the
point
to
which
his
madness
had
carried
*NL*
him
,
the
madness
fell
and
he
saw
his
life
before
him
as
it
was
.
He
was
a
*NL*
poor
man
,
the
husband
of
a
sickly
woman
,
whom
his
desertion
would
leave
*NL*
alone
and
destitute
;
and
even
if
he
had
had
the
heart
to
desert
her
he
*NL*
could
have
done
so
only
by
deceiving
two
kindly
people
who
had
pitied
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
and
walked
slowly
back
to
the
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
kitchen
door
Daniel
Byrne
sat
in
his
sleigh
behind
a
big-boned
*NL*
grey
who
pawed
the
snow
and
swung
his
long
head
restlessly
from
side
to
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
went
into
the
kitchen
and
found
his
wife
by
the
stove
.
Her
head
*NL*
was
wrapped
in
her
shawl
,
and
she
was
reading
a
book
called
``
Kidney
*NL*
Troubles
and
Their
Cure
''
on
which
he
had
had
to
pay
extra
postage
only
a
*NL*
few
days
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
did
not
move
or
look
up
when
he
entered
,
and
after
a
moment
he
*NL*
asked
:
``
Where
's
Mattie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
page
she
replied
:
``
I
presume
she
's
*NL*
getting
down
her
trunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
his
face
.
``
Getting
down
her
trunk
--
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jotham
Powell
's
down
in
the
wood-lot
,
and
Dan
'
l
Byrne
says
he
dars
n't
*NL*
leave
that
horse
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
,
without
stopping
to
hear
the
end
of
the
phrase
,
had
left
*NL*
the
kitchen
and
sprung
up
the
stairs
.
The
door
of
Mattie
's
room
was
*NL*
shut
,
and
he
wavered
a
moment
on
the
landing
.
``
Matt
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
;
but
there
was
no
answer
,
and
he
put
his
hand
on
the
door-knob
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
never
been
in
her
room
except
once
,
in
the
early
summer
,
when
*NL*
he
had
gone
there
to
plaster
up
a
leak
in
the
eaves
,
but
he
remembered
*NL*
exactly
how
everything
had
looked
:
the
red-and-white
quilt
on
her
narrow
*NL*
bed
,
the
pretty
pin-cushion
on
the
chest
of
drawers
,
and
over
it
the
*NL*
enlarged
photograph
of
her
mother
,
in
an
oxydized
frame
,
with
a
bunch
of
*NL*
dyed
grasses
at
the
back
.
Now
these
and
all
other
tokens
of
her
presence
*NL*
had
vanished
,
and
the
room
looked
as
bare
and
comfortless
as
when
Zeena
*NL*
had
shown
her
into
it
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
.
In
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
floor
stood
her
trunk
,
and
on
the
trunk
she
sat
in
her
Sunday
dress
,
*NL*
her
back
turned
to
the
door
and
her
face
in
her
hands
.
She
had
not
heard
*NL*
Ethan
's
call
because
she
was
sobbing
and
she
did
not
hear
his
step
till
*NL*
he
stood
close
behind
her
and
laid
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matt
--
oh
,
do
n't
--
oh
,
Matt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
up
,
lifting
her
wet
face
to
his
.
``
Ethan
--
I
thought
I
was
n't
*NL*
ever
going
to
see
you
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
in
his
arms
,
pressing
her
close
,
and
with
a
trembling
hand
*NL*
smoothed
away
the
hair
from
her
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
see
me
again
?
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sobbed
out
:
``
Jotham
said
you
told
him
we
was
n't
to
wait
dinner
for
*NL*
you
,
and
I
thought
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
I
meant
to
cut
it
?
''
he
finished
for
her
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
clung
to
him
without
answering
,
and
he
laid
his
lips
on
her
hair
,
*NL*
which
was
soft
yet
springy
,
like
certain
mosses
on
warm
slopes
,
and
had
*NL*
the
faint
woody
fragrance
of
fresh
sawdust
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
door
they
heard
Zeena
's
voice
calling
out
from
below
:
``
Dan
'
l
*NL*
Byrne
says
you
better
hurry
up
if
you
want
him
to
take
that
trunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
drew
apart
with
stricken
faces
.
Words
of
resistance
rushed
to
*NL*
Ethan
's
lips
and
died
there
.
Mattie
found
her
handkerchief
and
dried
her
*NL*
eyes
;
then
,
bending
down
,
she
took
hold
of
a
handle
of
the
trunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
put
her
aside
.
``
You
let
go
,
Matt
,
''
he
ordered
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
:
``
It
takes
two
to
coax
it
round
the
corner
''
;
and
submitting
*NL*
to
this
argument
he
grasped
the
other
handle
,
and
together
they
*NL*
manoeuvred
the
heavy
trunk
out
to
the
landing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
go
,
''
he
repeated
;
then
he
shouldered
the
trunk
and
carried
it
*NL*
down
the
stairs
and
across
the
passage
to
the
kitchen
.
Zeena
,
who
had
*NL*
gone
back
to
her
seat
by
the
stove
,
did
not
lift
her
head
from
her
book
*NL*
as
he
passed
.
Mattie
followed
him
out
of
the
door
and
helped
him
to
lift
*NL*
the
trunk
into
the
back
of
the
sleigh
.
When
it
was
in
place
they
stood
*NL*
side
by
side
on
the
door-step
,
watching
Daniel
Byrne
plunge
off
behind
*NL*
his
fidgety
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Ethan
that
his
heart
was
bound
with
cords
which
an
unseen
*NL*
hand
was
tightening
with
every
tick
of
the
clock
.
Twice
he
opened
his
*NL*
lips
to
speak
to
Mattie
and
found
no
breath
.
At
length
,
as
she
turned
to
*NL*
re-enter
the
house
,
he
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
drive
you
over
,
Matt
,
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
murmured
back
:
``
I
think
Zeena
wants
I
should
go
with
Jotham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
drive
you
over
,
''
he
repeated
;
and
she
went
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
without
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
Ethan
could
not
eat
.
If
he
lifted
his
eyes
they
rested
on
*NL*
Zeena
's
pinched
face
,
and
the
corners
of
her
straight
lips
seemed
to
*NL*
quiver
away
into
a
smile
.
She
ate
well
,
declaring
that
the
mild
weather
*NL*
made
her
feel
better
,
and
pressed
a
second
helping
of
beans
on
Jotham
*NL*
Powell
,
whose
wants
she
generally
ignored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
,
when
the
meal
was
over
,
went
about
her
usual
task
of
clearing
*NL*
the
table
and
washing
up
the
dishes
.
Zeena
,
after
feeding
the
cat
,
*NL*
had
returned
to
her
rocking-chair
by
the
stove
,
and
Jotham
Powell
,
who
*NL*
always
lingered
last
,
reluctantly
pushed
back
his
chair
and
moved
toward
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
threshold
he
turned
back
to
say
to
Ethan
:
``
What
time
'll
I
come
*NL*
round
for
Mattie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
was
standing
near
the
window
,
mechanically
filling
his
pipe
while
*NL*
he
watched
Mattie
move
to
and
fro
.
He
answered
:
``
You
need
n't
come
round
;
*NL*
I
'm
going
to
drive
her
over
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
the
rise
of
the
colour
in
Mattie
's
averted
cheek
,
and
the
quick
*NL*
lifting
of
Zeena
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
should
stay
here
this
afternoon
,
Ethan
,
''
his
wife
said
.
*NL*
``
Jotham
can
drive
Mattie
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
flung
an
imploring
glance
at
him
,
but
he
repeated
curtly
:
``
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
drive
her
over
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zeena
continued
in
the
same
even
tone
:
``
I
wanted
you
should
stay
and
fix
*NL*
up
that
stove
in
Mattie
's
room
afore
the
girl
gets
here
.
It
ai
n't
been
*NL*
drawing
right
for
nigh
on
a
month
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
's
voice
rose
indignantly
.
``
If
it
was
good
enough
for
Mattie
I
*NL*
guess
it
's
good
enough
for
a
hired
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
girl
that
's
coming
told
me
she
was
used
to
a
house
where
they
had
*NL*
a
furnace
,
''
Zeena
persisted
with
the
same
monotonous
mildness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
better
ha
'
stayed
there
then
,
''
he
flung
back
at
her
;
and
turning
*NL*
to
Mattie
he
added
in
a
hard
voice
:
``
You
be
ready
by
three
,
Matt
;
I
've
*NL*
got
business
at
Corbury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jotham
Powell
had
started
for
the
barn
,
and
Ethan
strode
down
after
him
*NL*
aflame
with
anger
.
The
pulses
in
his
temples
throbbed
and
a
fog
was
in
*NL*
his
eyes
.
He
went
about
his
task
without
knowing
what
force
directed
*NL*
him
,
or
whose
hands
and
feet
were
fulfilling
its
orders
.
It
was
not
till
*NL*
he
led
out
the
sorrel
and
backed
him
between
the
shafts
of
the
sleigh
*NL*
that
he
once
more
became
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
.
As
he
passed
*NL*
the
bridle
over
the
horse
's
head
,
and
wound
the
traces
around
the
*NL*
shafts
,
he
remembered
the
day
when
he
had
made
the
same
preparations
*NL*
in
order
to
drive
over
and
meet
his
wife
's
cousin
at
the
Flats
.
It
*NL*
was
little
more
than
a
year
ago
,
on
just
such
a
soft
afternoon
,
with
a
*NL*
``
feel
''
of
spring
in
the
air
.
The
sorrel
,
turning
the
same
big
ringed
eye
*NL*
on
him
,
nuzzled
the
palm
of
his
hand
in
the
same
way
;
and
one
by
one
all
*NL*
the
days
between
rose
up
and
stood
before
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
flung
the
bearskin
into
the
sleigh
,
climbed
to
the
seat
,
and
drove
up
*NL*
to
the
house
.
When
he
entered
the
kitchen
it
was
empty
,
but
Mattie
's
bag
*NL*
and
shawl
lay
ready
by
the
door
.
He
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
*NL*
listened
.
No
sound
reached
him
from
above
,
but
presently
he
thought
he
*NL*
heard
some
one
moving
about
in
his
deserted
study
,
and
pushing
open
the
*NL*
door
he
saw
Mattie
,
in
her
hat
and
jacket
,
standing
with
her
back
to
him
*NL*
near
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
at
his
approach
and
turning
quickly
,
said
:
``
Is
it
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
here
,
Matt
?
''
he
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
timidly
.
``
I
was
just
taking
a
look
round
--
that
's
all
,
''
*NL*
she
answered
,
with
a
wavering
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
back
into
the
kitchen
without
speaking
,
and
Ethan
picked
up
*NL*
her
bag
and
shawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
Zeena
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
went
upstairs
right
after
dinner
.
She
said
she
had
those
shooting
*NL*
pains
again
,
and
did
n't
want
to
be
disturbed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
she
say
good-bye
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
That
was
all
she
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
,
looking
slowly
about
the
kitchen
,
said
to
himself
with
a
shudder
*NL*
that
in
a
few
hours
he
would
be
returning
to
it
alone
.
Then
the
sense
*NL*
of
unreality
overcame
him
once
more
,
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
*NL*
believe
that
Mattie
stood
there
for
the
last
time
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
he
said
almost
gaily
,
opening
the
door
and
putting
her
bag
*NL*
into
the
sleigh
.
He
sprang
to
his
seat
and
bent
over
to
tuck
the
rug
*NL*
about
her
as
she
slipped
into
the
place
at
his
side
.
``
Now
then
,
go
*NL*
`
long
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
shake
of
the
reins
that
sent
the
sorrel
placidly
*NL*
jogging
down
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
got
lots
of
time
for
a
good
ride
,
Matt
!
''
he
cried
,
seeking
her
hand
*NL*
beneath
the
fur
and
pressing
it
in
his
.
His
face
tingled
and
he
felt
*NL*
dizzy
,
as
if
he
had
stopped
in
at
the
Starkfield
saloon
on
a
zero
day
*NL*
for
a
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
gate
,
instead
of
making
for
Starkfield
,
he
turned
the
sorrel
to
*NL*
the
right
,
up
the
Bettsbridge
road
.
Mattie
sat
silent
,
giving
no
sign
*NL*
of
surprise
;
but
after
a
moment
she
said
:
``
Are
you
going
round
by
Shadow
*NL*
Pond
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
and
answered
:
``
I
knew
you
'd
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
closer
under
the
bearskin
,
so
that
,
looking
sideways
around
his
*NL*
coat-sleeve
,
he
could
just
catch
the
tip
of
her
nose
and
a
blown
brown
*NL*
wave
of
hair
.
They
drove
slowly
up
the
road
between
fields
glistening
*NL*
under
the
pale
sun
,
and
then
bent
to
the
right
down
a
lane
edged
with
*NL*
spruce
and
larch
.
Ahead
of
them
,
a
long
way
off
,
a
range
of
hills
*NL*
stained
by
mottlings
of
black
forest
flowed
away
in
round
white
curves
*NL*
against
the
sky
.
The
lane
passed
into
a
pine-wood
with
boles
reddening
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
sun
and
delicate
blue
shadows
on
the
snow
.
As
they
*NL*
entered
it
the
breeze
fell
and
a
warm
stillness
seemed
to
drop
from
the
*NL*
branches
with
the
dropping
needles
.
Here
the
snow
was
so
pure
that
the
*NL*
tiny
tracks
of
wood-animals
had
left
on
it
intricate
lace-like
patterns
,
*NL*
and
the
bluish
cones
caught
in
its
surface
stood
out
like
ornaments
of
*NL*
bronze
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ethan
drove
on
in
silence
till
they
reached
a
part
of
the
wood
where
the
*NL*
pines
were
more
widely
spaced
;
then
he
drew
up
and
helped
Mattie
to
get
*NL*
out
of
the
sleigh
.
They
passed
between
the
aromatic
trunks
,
the
snow
*NL*
breaking
crisply
under
their
feet
,
till
they
came
to
a
small
sheet
*NL*
of
water
with
steep
wooded
sides
.
Across
its
frozen
surface
,
from
the
*NL*
farther
bank
,
a
single
hill
rising
against
the
western
sun
threw
the
*NL*
long
conical
shadow
which
gave
the
lake
its
name
.
It
was
a
shy
secret
*NL*
spot
,
full
of
the
same
dumb
melancholy
that
Ethan
felt
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
and
down
the
little
pebbly
beach
till
his
eye
lit
on
a
*NL*
fallen
tree-trunk
half
submerged
in
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
where
we
sat
at
the
picnic
,
''
he
reminded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entertainment
of
which
he
spoke
was
one
of
the
few
that
they
had
*NL*
taken
part
in
together
:
a
``
church
picnic
''
which
,
on
a
long
afternoon
of
*NL*
the
preceding
summer
,
had
filled
the
retired
place
with
merry-making
.
*NL*
Mattie
had
begged
him
to
go
with
her
but
he
had
refused
.
Then
,
toward
*NL*
sunset
,
coming
down
from
the
mountain
where
he
had
been
felling
timber
,
*NL*
he
had
been
caught
by
some
strayed
revellers
and
drawn
into
the
group
by
*NL*
the
lake
,
where
Mattie
,
encircled
by
facetious
youths
,
and
bright
as
*NL*
a
blackberry
under
her
spreading
hat
,
was
brewing
coffee
over
a
gipsy
*NL*
fire
.
He
remembered
the
shyness
he
had
felt
at
approaching
her
in
his
*NL*
uncouth
clothes
,
and
then
the
lighting
up
of
her
face
,
and
the
way
she
*NL*
had
broken
through
the
group
to
come
to
him
with
a
cup
in
her
hand
.
They
*NL*
had
sat
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
fallen
log
by
the
pond
,
and
she
had
*NL*
missed
her
gold
locket
,
and
set
the
young
men
searching
for
it
;
and
it
*NL*
was
Ethan
who
had
spied
it
in
the
moss
...
That
was
all
;
but
all
their
*NL*
intercourse
had
been
made
up
of
just
such
inarticulate
flashes
,
when
*NL*
they
seemed
to
come
suddenly
upon
happiness
as
if
they
had
surprised
a
*NL*
butterfly
in
the
winter
woods
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
right
there
I
found
your
locket
,
''
he
said
,
pushing
his
foot
into
*NL*
a
dense
tuft
of
blueberry
bushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
anybody
with
such
sharp
eyes
!
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
on
the
tree-trunk
in
the
sun
and
he
sat
down
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
as
pretty
as
a
picture
in
that
pink
hat
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
with
pleasure
.
``
Oh
,
I
guess
it
was
the
hat
!
''
she
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
never
before
avowed
their
inclination
so
openly
,
and
Ethan
,
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
had
the
illusion
that
he
was
a
free
man
,
wooing
the
girl
he
*NL*
meant
to
marry
.
He
looked
at
her
hair
and
longed
to
touch
it
again
,
and
*NL*
to
tell
her
that
it
smelt
of
the
woods
;
but
he
had
never
learned
to
say
*NL*
such
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
said
:
``
We
must
n't
stay
here
any
*NL*
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
gaze
at
her
vaguely
,
only
half-roused
from
his
dream
.
*NL*
``
There
's
plenty
of
time
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
looking
at
each
other
as
if
the
eyes
of
each
were
straining
*NL*
to
absorb
and
hold
fast
the
other
's
image
.
There
were
things
he
had
to
*NL*
say
to
her
before
they
parted
,
but
he
could
not
say
them
in
that
place
*NL*
of
summer
memories
,
and
he
turned
and
followed
her
in
silence
to
*NL*
the
sleigh
.
As
they
drove
away
the
sun
sank
behind
the
hill
and
the
*NL*
pine-boles
turned
from
red
to
grey
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
devious
track
between
the
fields
they
wound
back
to
the
Starkfield
*NL*
road
.
Under
the
open
sky
the
light
was
still
clear
,
with
a
reflection
of
*NL*
cold
red
on
the
eastern
hills
.
The
clumps
of
trees
in
the
snow
seemed
to
*NL*
draw
together
in
ruffled
lumps
,
like
birds
with
their
heads
under
their
*NL*
wings
;
and
the
sky
,
as
it
paled
,
rose
higher
,
leaving
the
earth
more
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
turned
into
the
Starkfield
road
Ethan
said
:
``
Matt
,
what
do
you
*NL*
mean
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
at
once
,
but
at
length
she
said
:
``
I
'll
try
to
get
a
*NL*
place
in
a
store
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
you
ca
n't
do
it
.
The
bad
air
and
the
standing
all
day
nearly
*NL*
killed
you
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
lot
stronger
than
I
was
before
I
came
to
Starkfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
you
're
going
to
throw
away
all
the
good
it
's
done
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
seemed
to
be
no
answer
to
this
,
and
again
they
drove
on
for
a
*NL*
while
without
speaking
.
With
every
yard
of
the
way
some
spot
where
they
*NL*
had
stood
,
and
laughed
together
or
been
silent
,
clutched
at
Ethan
and
*NL*
dragged
him
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
there
any
of
your
father
's
folks
could
help
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
n't
any
of
'em
I
'd
ask
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lowered
his
voice
to
say
:
``
You
know
there
's
nothing
I
would
n't
do
for
*NL*
you
if
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
there
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
,
but
he
felt
a
slight
tremor
in
the
shoulder
against
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Matt
,
''
he
broke
out
,
``
if
I
could
ha
'
gone
with
you
now
I
'd
ha
'
done
*NL*
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
him
,
pulling
a
scrap
of
paper
from
her
breast
.
``
Ethan
--
I
*NL*
found
this
,
''
she
stammered
.
Even
in
the
failing
light
he
saw
it
was
the
*NL*
letter
to
his
wife
that
he
had
begun
the
night
before
and
forgotten
*NL*
to
destroy
.
Through
his
astonishment
there
ran
a
fierce
thrill
of
joy
.
*NL*
``
Matt
--
''
he
cried
;
``
if
I
could
ha
'
done
it
,
would
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Ethan
,
Ethan
--
what
's
the
use
?
''
With
a
sudden
movement
she
tore
the
*NL*
letter
in
shreds
and
sent
them
fluttering
off
into
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
Matt
!
Tell
me
!
''
he
adjured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
for
a
moment
;
then
she
said
,
in
such
a
low
tone
that
he
*NL*
had
to
stoop
his
head
to
hear
her
:
``
I
used
to
think
of
it
sometimes
,
*NL*
summer
nights
when
the
moon
was
so
bright
.
I
could
n't
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
reeled
with
the
sweetness
of
it
.
``
As
long
ago
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
,
as
if
the
date
had
long
been
fixed
for
her
:
``
The
first
*NL*
time
was
at
Shadow
Pond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
why
you
gave
me
my
coffee
before
the
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Did
I
?
I
was
dreadfully
put
out
when
you
would
n't
go
to
*NL*
the
picnic
with
me
;
and
then
,
when
I
saw
you
coming
down
the
road
,
I
*NL*
thought
maybe
you
'd
gone
home
that
way
o
'
purpose
;
and
that
made
me
*NL*
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
again
.
They
had
reached
the
point
where
the
road
*NL*
dipped
to
the
hollow
by
Ethan
's
mill
and
as
they
descended
the
darkness
*NL*
descended
with
them
,
dropping
down
like
a
black
veil
from
the
heavy
*NL*
hemlock
boughs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
tied
hand
and
foot
,
Matt
.
There
is
n't
a
thing
I
can
do
,
''
he
began
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
write
to
me
sometimes
,
Ethan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
good
'll
writing
do
?
I
want
to
put
my
hand
out
and
touch
you
.
I
*NL*
want
to
do
for
you
and
care
for
you
.
I
want
to
be
there
when
you
're
sick
*NL*
and
when
you
're
lonesome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
think
but
what
I
'll
do
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
need
me
,
you
mean
?
I
suppose
you
'll
marry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Ethan
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
you
make
me
feel
,
Matt
.
I
'd
a
`
most
rather
have
*NL*
you
dead
than
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
wish
I
was
,
I
wish
I
was
!
''
she
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
her
weeping
shook
him
out
of
his
dark
anger
,
and
he
felt
*NL*
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
's
talk
that
way
,
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
we
,
when
it
's
true
?
I
've
been
wishing
it
every
minute
of
*NL*
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matt
!
You
be
quiet
!
Do
n't
you
say
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
never
anybody
been
good
to
me
but
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
either
,
when
I
ca
n't
lift
a
hand
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
it
's
true
just
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
reached
the
top
of
School
House
Hill
and
Starkfield
lay
below
*NL*
them
in
the
twilight
.
A
cutter
,
mounting
the
road
from
the
village
,
*NL*
passed
them
by
in
a
joyous
flutter
of
bells
,
and
they
straightened
*NL*
themselves
and
looked
ahead
with
rigid
faces
.
Along
the
main
street
*NL*
lights
had
begun
to
shine
from
the
house-fronts
and
stray
figures
were
*NL*
turning
in
here
and
there
at
the
gates
.
Ethan
,
with
a
touch
of
his
whip
,
*NL*
roused
the
sorrel
to
a
languid
trot
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
drew
near
the
end
of
the
village
the
cries
of
children
reached
*NL*
them
,
and
they
saw
a
knot
of
boys
,
with
sleds
behind
them
,
scattering
*NL*
across
the
open
space
before
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
this
'll
be
their
last
coast
for
a
day
or
two
,
''
Ethan
said
,
*NL*
looking
up
at
the
mild
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mattie
was
silent
,
and
he
added
:
``
We
were
to
have
gone
down
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
she
did
not
speak
and
,
prompted
by
an
obscure
desire
to
*NL*
help
himself
and
her
through
their
miserable
last
hour
,
he
went
on
*NL*
discursively
:
``
Ai
n't
it
funny
we
have
n't
been
down
together
but
just
*NL*
that
once
last
winter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
:
``
It
was
n't
often
I
got
down
to
the
village
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
reached
the
crest
of
the
Corbury
road
,
and
between
the
*NL*
indistinct
white
glimmer
of
the
church
and
the
black
curtain
of
the
*NL*
Varnum
spruces
the
slope
stretched
away
below
them
without
a
sled
on
its
*NL*
length
.
Some
erratic
impulse
prompted
Ethan
to
say
:
``
How
'd
you
like
me
*NL*
to
take
you
down
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
forced
a
laugh
.
``
Why
,
there
is
n't
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
all
the
time
we
want
.
Come
along
!
''
His
one
desire
now
was
to
*NL*
postpone
the
moment
of
turning
the
sorrel
toward
the
Flats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
girl
,
''
she
faltered
.
``
The
girl
'll
be
waiting
at
the
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
her
wait
.
You
'd
have
to
if
she
did
n't
.
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
note
of
authority
in
his
voice
seemed
to
subdue
her
,
and
when
he
*NL*
had
jumped
from
the
sleigh
she
let
him
help
her
out
,
saying
only
,
with
a
*NL*
vague
feint
of
reluctance
:
``
But
there
is
n't
a
sled
round
anywheres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
is
!
Right
over
there
under
the
spruces
.
''
He
threw
the
*NL*
bearskin
over
the
sorrel
,
who
stood
passively
by
the
roadside
,
hanging
*NL*
a
meditative
head
.
Then
he
caught
Mattie
's
hand
and
drew
her
after
him
*NL*
toward
the
sled
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seated
herself
obediently
and
he
took
his
place
behind
her
,
so
close
*NL*
that
her
hair
brushed
his
face
.
``
All
right
,
Matt
?
''
he
called
out
,
as
if
*NL*
the
width
of
the
road
had
been
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
head
to
say
:
``
It
's
dreadfully
dark
.
Are
you
sure
you
can
*NL*
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
contemptuously
:
``
I
could
go
down
this
coast
with
my
*NL*
eyes
tied
!
''
and
she
laughed
with
him
,
as
if
she
liked
his
audacity
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
he
sat
still
a
moment
,
straining
his
eyes
down
the
long
*NL*
hill
,
for
it
was
the
most
confusing
hour
of
the
evening
,
the
hour
when
*NL*
the
last
clearness
from
the
upper
sky
is
merged
with
the
rising
night
in
*NL*
a
blur
that
disguises
landmarks
and
falsifies
distances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sled
started
with
a
bound
,
and
they
flew
on
through
the
dusk
,
*NL*
gathering
smoothness
and
speed
as
they
went
,
with
the
hollow
night
*NL*
opening
out
below
them
and
the
air
singing
by
like
an
organ
.
Mattie
sat
*NL*
perfectly
still
,
but
as
they
reached
the
bend
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
*NL*
where
the
big
elm
thrust
out
a
deadly
elbow
,
he
fancied
that
she
shrank
*NL*
a
little
closer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
scared
,
Matt
!
''
he
cried
exultantly
,
as
they
spun
safely
past
*NL*
it
and
flew
down
the
second
slope
;
and
when
they
reached
the
level
*NL*
ground
beyond
,
and
the
speed
of
the
sled
began
to
slacken
,
he
heard
her
*NL*
give
a
little
laugh
of
glee
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sprang
off
and
started
to
walk
back
up
the
hill
.
Ethan
dragged
the
*NL*
sled
with
one
hand
and
passed
the
other
through
Mattie
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
scared
I
'd
run
you
into
the
elm
?
''
he
asked
with
a
boyish
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
I
was
never
scared
with
you
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strange
exaltation
of
his
mood
had
brought
on
one
of
his
rare
fits
*NL*
of
boastfulness
.
``
It
is
a
tricky
place
,
though
.
The
least
swerve
,
*NL*
and
we
'd
never
ha
'
come
up
again
.
But
I
can
measure
distances
to
a
*NL*
hair
's
-
breadth
--
always
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
murmured
:
``
I
always
say
you
've
got
the
surest
eye
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Deep
silence
had
fallen
with
the
starless
dusk
,
and
they
leaned
on
each
*NL*
other
without
speaking
;
but
at
every
step
of
their
climb
Ethan
said
to
*NL*
himself
:
``
It
's
the
last
time
we
'll
ever
walk
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
mounted
slowly
to
the
top
of
the
hill
.
When
they
were
abreast
of
*NL*
the
church
he
stooped
his
head
to
her
to
ask
:
``
Are
you
tired
?
''
and
she
*NL*
answered
,
breathing
quickly
:
``
It
was
splendid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
pressure
of
his
arm
he
guided
her
toward
the
Norway
spruces
.
``
I
*NL*
guess
this
sled
must
be
Ned
Hale
's
.
Anyhow
I
'll
leave
it
where
I
found
*NL*
it
.
''
He
drew
the
sled
up
to
the
Varnum
gate
and
rested
it
against
the
*NL*
fence
.
As
he
raised
himself
he
suddenly
felt
Mattie
close
to
him
among
*NL*
the
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
where
Ned
and
Ruth
kissed
each
other
?
''
she
whispered
*NL*
breathlessly
,
and
flung
her
arms
about
him
.
Her
lips
,
groping
for
his
,
*NL*
swept
over
his
face
,
and
he
held
her
fast
in
a
rapture
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye-good-bye
,
''
she
stammered
,
and
kissed
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Matt
,
I
ca
n't
let
you
go
!
''
broke
from
him
in
the
same
old
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
freed
herself
from
his
hold
and
he
heard
her
sobbing
.
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
go
either
!
''
she
wailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matt
!
What
'll
we
do
?
What
'll
we
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
clung
to
each
other
's
hands
like
children
,
and
her
body
shook
with
*NL*
desperate
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
stillness
they
heard
the
church
clock
striking
five
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Ethan
,
it
's
time
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
her
back
to
him
.
``
Time
for
what
?
You
do
n't
suppose
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
leave
you
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
missed
my
train
where
'd
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
if
you
catch
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
silent
,
her
hands
lying
cold
and
relaxed
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
good
of
either
of
us
going
anywheres
without
the
other
one
*NL*
now
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
motionless
,
as
if
she
had
not
heard
him
.
Then
she
snatched
*NL*
her
hands
from
his
,
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
,
and
pressed
a
sudden
*NL*
drenched
cheek
against
his
face
.
``
Ethan
!
Ethan
!
I
want
you
to
take
me
*NL*
down
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
coast
.
Right
off
,
''
she
panted
.
``
So
'
t
we
'll
never
come
up
any
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matt
!
What
on
earth
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
lips
close
against
his
ear
to
say
:
``
Right
into
the
big
elm
.
*NL*
You
said
you
could
.
So
'
t
we
'd
never
have
to
leave
each
other
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
are
you
talking
of
?
You
're
crazy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
crazy
;
but
I
will
be
if
I
leave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Matt
,
Matt
--
''
he
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tightened
her
fierce
hold
about
his
neck
.
Her
face
lay
close
to
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ethan
,
where
'll
I
go
if
I
leave
you
?
I
do
n't
know
how
to
get
along
*NL*
alone
.
You
said
so
yourself
just
now
.
Nobody
but
you
was
ever
good
to
*NL*
me
.
And
there
'll
be
that
strange
girl
in
the
house
...
and
she
'll
sleep
*NL*
in
my
bed
,
where
I
used
to
lay
nights
and
listen
to
hear
you
come
up
the
*NL*
stairs
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
were
like
fragments
torn
from
his
heart
.
With
them
came
the
*NL*
hated
vision
of
the
house
he
was
going
back
to
--
of
the
stairs
he
would
*NL*
have
to
go
up
every
night
,
of
the
woman
who
would
wait
for
him
there
.
*NL*
And
the
sweetness
of
Mattie
's
avowal
,
the
wild
wonder
of
knowing
at
*NL*
last
that
all
that
had
happened
to
him
had
happened
to
her
too
,
made
the
*NL*
other
vision
more
abhorrent
,
the
other
life
more
intolerable
to
return
*NL*
to
...
*NL*
*NL*
Her
pleadings
still
came
to
him
between
short
sobs
,
but
he
no
longer
*NL*
heard
what
she
was
saying
.
Her
hat
had
slipped
back
and
he
was
stroking
*NL*
her
hair
.
He
wanted
to
get
the
feeling
of
it
into
his
hand
,
so
that
it
*NL*
would
sleep
there
like
a
seed
in
winter
.
Once
he
found
her
mouth
again
,
*NL*
and
they
seemed
to
be
by
the
pond
together
in
the
burning
August
sun
.
*NL*
But
his
cheek
touched
hers
,
and
it
was
cold
and
full
of
weeping
,
and
he
*NL*
saw
the
road
to
the
Flats
under
the
night
and
heard
the
whistle
of
the
*NL*
train
up
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spruces
swathed
them
in
blackness
and
silence
.
They
might
have
been
*NL*
in
their
coffins
underground
.
He
said
to
himself
:
``
Perhaps
it
'll
feel
*NL*
like
this
...
''
and
then
again
:
``
After
this
I
sha
'n'
t
feel
anything
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
heard
the
old
sorrel
whinny
across
the
road
,
and
thought
:
*NL*
``
He
's
wondering
why
he
does
n't
get
his
supper
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
Mattie
whispered
,
tugging
at
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sombre
violence
constrained
him
:
she
seemed
the
embodied
instrument
*NL*
of
fate
.
He
pulled
the
sled
out
,
blinking
like
a
night-bird
as
he
passed
*NL*
from
the
shade
of
the
spruces
into
the
transparent
dusk
of
the
open
.
The
*NL*
slope
below
them
was
deserted
.
All
Starkfield
was
at
supper
,
and
not
a
*NL*
figure
crossed
the
open
space
before
the
church
.
The
sky
,
swollen
with
*NL*
the
clouds
that
announce
a
thaw
,
hung
as
low
as
before
a
summer
storm
.
*NL*
He
strained
his
eyes
through
the
dimness
,
and
they
seemed
less
keen
,
*NL*
less
capable
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
seat
on
the
sled
and
Mattie
instantly
placed
herself
in
*NL*
front
of
him
.
Her
hat
had
fallen
into
the
snow
and
his
lips
were
in
her
*NL*
hair
.
He
stretched
out
his
legs
,
drove
his
heels
into
the
road
to
keep
*NL*
the
sled
from
slipping
forward
,
and
bent
her
head
back
between
his
*NL*
hands
.
Then
suddenly
he
sprang
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
,
''
he
ordered
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
tone
she
always
heeded
,
but
she
cowered
down
in
her
seat
,
*NL*
repeating
vehemently
:
``
No
,
no
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
sit
in
front
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
How
can
you
steer
in
front
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
have
to
.
We
'll
follow
the
track
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
spoke
in
smothered
whispers
,
as
though
the
night
were
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
!
Get
up
!
''
he
urged
her
;
but
she
kept
on
repeating
:
``
Why
do
you
*NL*
want
to
sit
in
front
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
--
because
I
want
to
feel
you
holding
me
,
''
he
stammered
,
and
*NL*
dragged
her
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
seemed
to
satisfy
her
,
or
else
she
yielded
to
the
power
of
*NL*
his
voice
.
He
bent
down
,
feeling
in
the
obscurity
for
the
glassy
slide
*NL*
worn
by
preceding
coasters
,
and
placed
the
runners
carefully
between
its
*NL*
edges
.
She
waited
while
he
seated
himself
with
crossed
legs
in
the
front
*NL*
of
the
sled
;
then
she
crouched
quickly
down
at
his
back
and
clasped
her
*NL*
arms
about
him
.
Her
breath
in
his
neck
set
him
shuddering
again
,
and
*NL*
he
almost
sprang
from
his
seat
.
But
in
a
flash
he
remembered
the
*NL*
alternative
.
She
was
right
:
this
was
better
than
parting
.
He
leaned
back
*NL*
and
drew
her
mouth
to
his
...
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
they
started
he
heard
the
sorrel
's
whinny
again
,
and
the
*NL*
familiar
wistful
call
,
and
all
the
confused
images
it
brought
with
it
,
*NL*
went
with
him
down
the
first
reach
of
the
road
.
Half-way
down
there
*NL*
was
a
sudden
drop
,
then
a
rise
,
and
after
that
another
long
delirious
*NL*
descent
.
As
they
took
wing
for
this
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
*NL*
flying
indeed
,
flying
far
up
into
the
cloudy
night
,
with
Starkfield
*NL*
immeasurably
below
them
,
falling
away
like
a
speck
in
space
...
Then
the
*NL*
big
elm
shot
up
ahead
,
lying
in
wait
for
them
at
the
bend
of
the
road
,
*NL*
and
he
said
between
his
teeth
:
``
We
can
fetch
it
;
I
know
we
can
fetch
*NL*
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
flew
toward
the
tree
Mattie
pressed
her
arms
tighter
,
and
her
*NL*
blood
seemed
to
be
in
his
veins
.
Once
or
twice
the
sled
swerved
a
little
*NL*
under
them
.
He
slanted
his
body
to
keep
it
headed
for
the
elm
,
repeating
*NL*
to
himself
again
and
again
:
``
I
know
we
can
fetch
it
''
;
and
little
phrases
*NL*
she
had
spoken
ran
through
his
head
and
danced
before
him
on
the
air
.
*NL*
The
big
tree
loomed
bigger
and
closer
,
and
as
they
bore
down
on
it
*NL*
he
thought
:
``
It
's
waiting
for
us
:
it
seems
to
know
.
''
But
suddenly
his
*NL*
wife
's
face
,
with
twisted
monstrous
lineaments
,
thrust
itself
between
*NL*
him
and
his
goal
,
and
he
made
an
instinctive
movement
to
brush
it
aside
.
*NL*
The
sled
swerved
in
response
,
but
he
righted
it
again
,
kept
it
straight
,
*NL*
and
drove
down
on
the
black
projecting
mass
.
There
was
a
last
instant
*NL*
when
the
air
shot
past
him
like
millions
of
fiery
wires
;
and
then
the
*NL*
elm
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
sky
was
still
thick
,
but
looking
straight
up
he
saw
a
single
star
,
*NL*
and
tried
vaguely
to
reckon
whether
it
were
Sirius
,
or
--
or
--
The
effort
*NL*
tired
him
too
much
,
and
he
closed
his
heavy
lids
and
thought
that
he
*NL*
would
sleep
...
The
stillness
was
so
profound
that
he
heard
a
little
*NL*
animal
twittering
somewhere
near
by
under
the
snow
.
It
made
a
small
*NL*
frightened
cheep
like
a
field
mouse
,
and
he
wondered
languidly
if
*NL*
it
were
hurt
.
Then
he
understood
that
it
must
be
in
pain
:
pain
so
*NL*
excruciating
that
he
seemed
,
mysteriously
,
to
feel
it
shooting
through
*NL*
his
own
body
.
He
tried
in
vain
to
roll
over
in
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
sound
,
and
stretched
his
left
arm
out
across
the
snow
.
And
now
it
was
as
*NL*
though
he
felt
rather
than
heard
the
twittering
;
it
seemed
to
be
under
*NL*
his
palm
,
which
rested
on
something
soft
and
springy
.
The
thought
of
*NL*
the
animal
's
suffering
was
intolerable
to
him
and
he
struggled
to
raise
*NL*
himself
,
and
could
not
because
a
rock
,
or
some
huge
mass
,
seemed
to
be
*NL*
lying
on
him
.
But
he
continued
to
finger
about
cautiously
with
his
left
*NL*
hand
,
thinking
he
might
get
hold
of
the
little
creature
and
help
it
;
and
*NL*
all
at
once
he
knew
that
the
soft
thing
he
had
touched
was
Mattie
's
hair
*NL*
and
that
his
hand
was
on
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dragged
himself
to
his
knees
,
the
monstrous
load
on
him
moving
with
*NL*
him
as
he
moved
,
and
his
hand
went
over
and
over
her
face
,
and
he
felt
*NL*
that
the
twittering
came
from
her
lips
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
his
face
down
close
to
hers
,
with
his
ear
to
her
mouth
,
and
in
*NL*
the
darkness
he
saw
her
eyes
open
and
heard
her
say
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Matt
,
I
thought
we
'd
fetched
it
,
''
he
moaned
;
and
far
off
,
up
the
*NL*
hill
,
he
heard
the
sorrel
whinny
,
and
thought
:
``
I
ought
to
be
getting
*NL*
him
his
feed
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
QUERULOUS
DRONE
ceased
as
I
entered
Frome
's
kitchen
,
and
of
the
two
*NL*
women
sitting
there
I
could
not
tell
which
had
been
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
,
on
my
appearing
,
raised
her
tall
bony
figure
from
her
seat
,
*NL*
not
as
if
to
welcome
me
--
for
she
threw
me
no
more
than
a
brief
glance
*NL*
of
surprise
--
but
simply
to
set
about
preparing
the
meal
which
Frome
's
*NL*
absence
had
delayed
.
A
slatternly
calico
wrapper
hung
from
her
shoulders
*NL*
and
the
wisps
of
her
thin
grey
hair
were
drawn
away
from
a
high
forehead
*NL*
and
fastened
at
the
back
by
a
broken
comb
.
She
had
pale
opaque
eyes
*NL*
which
revealed
nothing
and
reflected
nothing
,
and
her
narrow
lips
were
*NL*
of
the
same
sallow
colour
as
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
woman
was
much
smaller
and
slighter
.
She
sat
huddled
in
an
*NL*
arm-chair
near
the
stove
,
and
when
I
came
in
she
turned
her
head
quickly
*NL*
toward
me
,
without
the
least
corresponding
movement
of
her
body
.
*NL*
Her
hair
was
as
grey
as
her
companion
's
,
her
face
as
bloodless
and
*NL*
shrivelled
,
but
amber-tinted
,
with
swarthy
shadows
sharpening
the
nose
*NL*
and
hollowing
the
temples
.
Under
her
shapeless
dress
her
body
kept
its
*NL*
limp
immobility
,
and
her
dark
eyes
had
the
bright
witch-like
stare
that
*NL*
disease
of
the
spine
sometimes
gives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
for
that
part
of
the
country
the
kitchen
was
a
poor-looking
place
.
*NL*
With
the
exception
of
the
dark-eyed
woman
's
chair
,
which
looked
like
a
*NL*
soiled
relic
of
luxury
bought
at
a
country
auction
,
the
furniture
was
of
*NL*
the
roughest
kind
.
Three
coarse
china
plates
and
a
broken-nosed
milk-jug
*NL*
had
been
set
on
a
greasy
table
scored
with
knife-cuts
,
and
a
couple
*NL*
of
straw-bottomed
chairs
and
a
kitchen
dresser
of
unpainted
pine
stood
*NL*
meagrely
against
the
plaster
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
,
it
's
cold
here
!
The
fire
must
be
`
most
out
,
''
Frome
said
,
glancing
*NL*
about
him
apologetically
as
he
followed
me
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
woman
,
who
had
moved
away
from
us
toward
the
dresser
,
took
no
*NL*
notice
;
but
the
other
,
from
her
cushioned
niche
,
answered
complainingly
,
*NL*
in
a
high
thin
voice
.
``
It
's
on
'
y
just
been
made
up
this
very
minute
.
*NL*
Zeena
fell
asleep
and
slep
'
ever
so
long
,
and
I
thought
I
'd
be
frozen
*NL*
stiff
before
I
could
wake
her
up
and
get
her
to
`
tend
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
then
that
it
was
she
who
had
been
speaking
when
we
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
companion
,
who
was
just
coming
back
to
the
table
with
the
remains
*NL*
of
a
cold
mince-pie
in
a
battered
pie-dish
,
set
down
her
unappetising
*NL*
burden
without
appearing
to
hear
the
accusation
brought
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frome
stood
hesitatingly
before
her
as
she
advanced
;
then
he
looked
at
*NL*
me
and
said
:
``
This
is
my
wife
,
Mis
'
Frome
.
''
After
another
interval
he
*NL*
added
,
turning
toward
the
figure
in
the
arm-chair
:
``
And
this
is
Miss
*NL*
Mattie
Silver
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hale
,
tender
soul
,
had
pictured
me
as
lost
in
the
Flats
and
buried
*NL*
under
a
snow-drift
;
and
so
lively
was
her
satisfaction
on
seeing
me
*NL*
safely
restored
to
her
the
next
morning
that
I
felt
my
peril
had
caused
*NL*
me
to
advance
several
degrees
in
her
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
was
her
amazement
,
and
that
of
old
Mrs.
Varnum
,
on
learning
that
*NL*
Ethan
Frome
's
old
horse
had
carried
me
to
and
from
Corbury
Junction
*NL*
through
the
worst
blizzard
of
the
winter
;
greater
still
their
surprise
*NL*
when
they
heard
that
his
master
had
taken
me
in
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
their
wondering
exclamations
I
felt
a
secret
curiosity
to
know
*NL*
what
impressions
I
had
received
from
my
night
in
the
Frome
household
,
*NL*
and
divined
that
the
best
way
of
breaking
down
their
reserve
was
to
let
*NL*
them
try
to
penetrate
mine
.
I
therefore
confined
myself
to
saying
,
in
a
*NL*
matter-of-fact
tone
,
that
I
had
been
received
with
great
kindness
,
and
*NL*
that
Frome
had
made
a
bed
for
me
in
a
room
on
the
ground-floor
which
*NL*
seemed
in
happier
days
to
have
been
fitted
up
as
a
kind
of
writing-room
*NL*
or
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Mrs.
Hale
mused
,
``
in
such
a
storm
I
suppose
he
felt
he
could
n't
*NL*
do
less
than
take
you
in
--
but
I
guess
it
went
hard
with
Ethan
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
but
what
you
're
the
only
stranger
has
set
foot
in
that
house
for
*NL*
over
twenty
years
.
He
's
that
proud
he
do
n't
even
like
his
oldest
friends
*NL*
to
go
there
;
and
I
do
n't
know
as
any
do
,
any
more
,
except
myself
and
the
*NL*
doctor
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
still
go
there
,
Mrs.
Hale
?
''
I
ventured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
go
a
good
deal
after
the
accident
,
when
I
was
first
married
;
*NL*
but
after
awhile
I
got
to
think
it
made
'em
feel
worse
to
see
us
.
And
*NL*
then
one
thing
and
another
came
,
and
my
own
troubles
...
But
I
generally
*NL*
make
out
to
drive
over
there
round
about
New
Year
's
,
and
once
in
the
*NL*
summer
.
Only
I
always
try
to
pick
a
day
when
Ethan
's
off
somewheres
.
*NL*
It
's
bad
enough
to
see
the
two
women
sitting
there
--
but
his
face
,
when
he
*NL*
looks
round
that
bare
place
,
just
kills
me
...
You
see
,
I
can
look
back
*NL*
and
call
it
up
in
his
mother
's
day
,
before
their
troubles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mrs.
Varnum
,
by
this
time
,
had
gone
up
to
bed
,
and
her
daughter
*NL*
and
I
were
sitting
alone
,
after
supper
,
in
the
austere
seclusion
of
*NL*
the
horse-hair
parlour
.
Mrs.
Hale
glanced
at
me
tentatively
,
as
though
*NL*
trying
to
see
how
much
footing
my
conjectures
gave
her
;
and
I
guessed
*NL*
that
if
she
had
kept
silence
till
now
it
was
because
she
had
been
*NL*
waiting
,
through
all
the
years
,
for
some
one
who
should
see
what
she
*NL*
alone
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
to
let
her
trust
in
me
gather
strength
before
I
said
:
``
Yes
,
*NL*
it
's
pretty
bad
,
seeing
all
three
of
them
there
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
her
mild
brows
into
a
frown
of
pain
.
``
It
was
just
awful
from
*NL*
the
beginning
.
I
was
here
in
the
house
when
they
were
carried
up
--
they
*NL*
laid
Mattie
Silver
in
the
room
you
're
in
.
She
and
I
were
great
friends
,
*NL*
and
she
was
to
have
been
my
bridesmaid
in
the
spring
...
When
she
came
*NL*
to
I
went
up
to
her
and
stayed
all
night
.
They
gave
her
things
to
quiet
*NL*
her
,
and
she
did
n't
know
much
till
to
`
rd
morning
,
and
then
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
she
woke
up
just
like
herself
,
and
looked
straight
at
me
out
*NL*
of
her
big
eyes
,
and
said
...
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
why
I
'm
telling
you
all
*NL*
this
,
''
Mrs.
Hale
broke
off
,
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
off
her
spectacles
,
wiped
the
moisture
from
them
,
and
put
them
*NL*
on
again
with
an
unsteady
hand
.
``
It
got
about
the
next
day
,
''
she
went
*NL*
on
,
``
that
Zeena
Frome
had
sent
Mattie
off
in
a
hurry
because
she
had
a
*NL*
hired
girl
coming
,
and
the
folks
here
could
never
rightly
tell
what
she
*NL*
and
Ethan
were
doing
that
night
coasting
,
when
they
'd
ought
to
have
been
*NL*
on
their
way
to
the
Flats
to
ketch
the
train
...
I
never
knew
myself
*NL*
what
Zeena
thought
--
I
do
n't
to
this
day
.
Nobody
knows
Zeena
's
thoughts
.
*NL*
Anyhow
,
when
she
heard
o
'
the
accident
she
came
right
in
and
stayed
with
*NL*
Ethan
over
to
the
minister
's
,
where
they
'd
carried
him
.
And
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
doctors
said
that
Mattie
could
be
moved
,
Zeena
sent
for
her
and
took
*NL*
her
back
to
the
farm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
she
's
been
ever
since
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hale
answered
simply
:
``
There
was
nowhere
else
for
her
to
go
;
''
and
*NL*
my
heart
tightened
at
the
thought
of
the
hard
compulsions
of
the
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
she
's
been
,
''
Mrs.
Hale
continued
,
``
and
Zeena
's
done
for
her
,
*NL*
and
done
for
Ethan
,
as
good
as
she
could
.
It
was
a
miracle
,
considering
*NL*
how
sick
she
was
--
but
she
seemed
to
be
raised
right
up
just
when
the
call
*NL*
came
to
her
.
Not
as
she
's
ever
given
up
doctoring
,
and
she
's
had
sick
*NL*
spells
right
along
;
but
she
's
had
the
strength
given
her
to
care
for
*NL*
those
two
for
over
twenty
years
,
and
before
the
accident
came
she
*NL*
thought
she
could
n't
even
care
for
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hale
paused
a
moment
,
and
I
remained
silent
,
plunged
in
the
vision
*NL*
of
what
her
words
evoked
.
``
It
's
horrible
for
them
all
,
''
I
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
it
's
pretty
bad
.
And
they
ai
n't
any
of
'em
easy
people
either
.
*NL*
Mattie
was
,
before
the
accident
;
I
never
knew
a
sweeter
nature
.
But
*NL*
she
's
suffered
too
much
--
that
's
what
I
always
say
when
folks
tell
me
how
*NL*
she
's
soured
.
And
Zeena
,
she
was
always
cranky
.
Not
but
what
she
bears
*NL*
with
Mattie
wonderful
--
I
've
seen
that
myself
.
But
sometimes
the
two
*NL*
of
them
get
going
at
each
other
,
and
then
Ethan
's
face
'd
break
your
*NL*
heart
...
When
I
see
that
,
I
think
it
's
him
that
suffers
most
...
anyhow
*NL*
it
ai
n't
Zeena
,
because
she
ai
n't
got
the
time
...
It
's
a
pity
,
though
,
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Hale
ended
,
sighing
,
``
that
they
're
all
shut
up
there
'n
that
one
*NL*
kitchen
.
In
the
summertime
,
on
pleasant
days
,
they
move
Mattie
into
*NL*
the
parlour
,
or
out
in
the
door-yard
,
and
that
makes
it
easier
...
but
*NL*
winters
there
's
the
fires
to
be
thought
of
;
and
there
ai
n't
a
dime
to
*NL*
spare
up
at
the
Fromes
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hale
drew
a
deep
breath
,
as
though
her
memory
were
eased
of
its
*NL*
long
burden
,
and
she
had
no
more
to
say
;
but
suddenly
an
impulse
of
*NL*
complete
avowal
seized
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
off
her
spectacles
again
,
leaned
toward
me
across
the
bead-work
*NL*
table-cover
,
and
went
on
with
lowered
voice
:
``
There
was
one
day
,
about
*NL*
a
week
after
the
accident
,
when
they
all
thought
Mattie
could
n't
live
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
say
it
's
a
pity
she
did
.
I
said
it
right
out
to
our
minister
*NL*
once
,
and
he
was
shocked
at
me
.
Only
he
was
n't
with
me
that
morning
*NL*
when
she
first
came
to
...
And
I
say
,
if
she
'd
ha
'
died
,
Ethan
might
ha
'
*NL*
lived
;
and
the
way
they
are
now
,
I
do
n't
see
's
there
's
much
difference
*NL*
between
the
Fromes
up
at
the
farm
and
the
Fromes
down
in
the
graveyard
;
*NL*
`
cept
that
down
there
they
're
all
quiet

and
the
women
have
got
to

their
