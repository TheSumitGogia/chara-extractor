THE
GOOD
SOLDIER
*NL*
*NL*

I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THIS
is
the
saddest
story
I
have
ever
heard
.
We
had
known
the
*NL*
Ashburnhams
for
nine
seasons
of
the
town
of
Nauheim
with
an
extreme
*NL*
intimacy
--
or
,
rather
with
an
acquaintanceship
as
loose
and
easy
and
yet
*NL*
as
close
as
a
good
glove
's
with
your
hand
.
My
wife
and
I
knew
Captain
*NL*
and
Mrs
Ashburnham
as
well
as
it
was
possible
to
know
anybody
,
and
yet
,
*NL*
in
another
sense
,
we
knew
nothing
at
all
about
them
.
This
is
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
a
state
of
things
only
possible
with
English
people
of
whom
,
till
today
,
*NL*
when
I
sit
down
to
puzzle
out
what
I
know
of
this
sad
affair
,
I
knew
*NL*
nothing
whatever
.
Six
months
ago
I
had
never
been
to
England
,
and
,
*NL*
certainly
,
I
had
never
sounded
the
depths
of
an
English
heart
.
I
had
*NL*
known
the
shallows
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
we
were
not
acquainted
with
many
English
*NL*
people
.
Living
,
as
we
perforce
lived
,
in
Europe
,
and
being
,
as
we
*NL*
perforce
were
,
leisured
Americans
,
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
we
*NL*
were
un-American
,
we
were
thrown
very
much
into
the
society
of
the
*NL*
nicer
English
.
Paris
,
you
see
,
was
our
home
.
Somewhere
between
Nice
and
*NL*
Bordighera
provided
yearly
winter
quarters
for
us
,
and
Nauheim
always
*NL*
received
us
from
July
to
September
.
You
will
gather
from
this
statement
*NL*
that
one
of
us
had
,
as
the
saying
is
,
a
``
heart
''
,
and
,
from
the
statement
*NL*
that
my
wife
is
dead
,
that
she
was
the
sufferer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Ashburnham
also
had
a
heart
.
But
,
whereas
a
yearly
month
or
so
*NL*
at
Nauheim
tuned
him
up
to
exactly
the
right
pitch
for
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
twelvemonth
,
the
two
months
or
so
were
only
just
enough
to
keep
*NL*
poor
Florence
alive
from
year
to
year
.
The
reason
for
his
heart
was
,
*NL*
approximately
,
polo
,
or
too
much
hard
sportsmanship
in
his
youth
.
The
*NL*
reason
for
poor
Florence
's
broken
years
was
a
storm
at
sea
upon
our
*NL*
first
crossing
to
Europe
,
and
the
immediate
reasons
for
our
imprisonment
*NL*
in
that
continent
were
doctor
's
orders
.
They
said
that
even
the
short
*NL*
Channel
crossing
might
well
kill
the
poor
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
all
first
met
,
Captain
Ashburnham
,
home
on
sick
leave
from
an
*NL*
India
to
which
he
was
never
to
return
,
was
thirty-three
;
Mrs
Ashburnham
*NL*
Leonora
--
was
thirty-one
.
I
was
thirty-six
and
poor
Florence
thirty
.
*NL*
Thus
today
Florence
would
have
been
thirty-nine
and
Captain
Ashburnham
*NL*
forty-two
;
whereas
I
am
forty-five
and
Leonora
forty
.
You
will
perceive
,
*NL*
therefore
,
that
our
friendship
has
been
a
young-middle-aged
affair
,
*NL*
since
we
were
all
of
us
of
quite
quiet
dispositions
,
the
Ashburnhams
*NL*
being
more
particularly
what
in
England
it
is
the
custom
to
call
``
quite
*NL*
good
people
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
descended
,
as
you
will
probably
expect
,
from
the
Ashburnham
*NL*
who
accompanied
Charles
I
to
the
scaffold
,
and
,
as
you
must
also
expect
*NL*
with
this
class
of
English
people
,
you
would
never
have
noticed
it
.
*NL*
Mrs
Ashburnham
was
a
Powys
;
Florence
was
a
Hurlbird
of
Stamford
,
*NL*
Connecticut
,
where
,
as
you
know
,
they
are
more
old-fashioned
than
even
*NL*
the
inhabitants
of
Cranford
,
England
,
could
have
been
.
I
myself
am
a
*NL*
Dowell
of
Philadelphia
,
Pa.
,
where
,
it
is
historically
true
,
there
*NL*
are
more
old
English
families
than
you
would
find
in
any
six
English
*NL*
counties
taken
together
.
I
carry
about
with
me
,
indeed
--
as
if
it
*NL*
were
the
only
thing
that
invisibly
anchored
me
to
any
spot
upon
the
*NL*
globe
--
the
title
deeds
of
my
farm
,
which
once
covered
several
blocks
*NL*
between
Chestnut
and
Walnut
Streets
.
These
title
deeds
are
of
wampum
,
*NL*
the
grant
of
an
Indian
chief
to
the
first
Dowell
,
who
left
Farnham
in
*NL*
Surrey
in
company
with
William
Penn.
.
Florence
's
people
,
as
is
so
*NL*
often
the
case
with
the
inhabitants
of
Connecticut
,
came
from
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
Fordingbridge
,
where
the
Ashburnhams
'
place
is
.
From
*NL*
there
,
at
this
moment
,
I
am
actually
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
well
ask
why
I
write
.
And
yet
my
reasons
are
quite
many
.
For
it
*NL*
is
not
unusual
in
human
beings
who
have
witnessed
the
sack
of
a
city
or
*NL*
the
falling
to
pieces
of
a
people
to
desire
to
set
down
what
they
have
*NL*
witnessed
for
the
benefit
of
unknown
heirs
or
of
generations
infinitely
*NL*
remote
;
or
,
if
you
please
,
just
to
get
the
sight
out
of
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
has
said
that
the
death
of
a
mouse
from
cancer
is
the
whole
*NL*
sack
of
Rome
by
the
Goths
,
and
I
swear
to
you
that
the
breaking
up
*NL*
of
our
little
four-square
coterie
was
such
another
unthinkable
event
.
*NL*
Supposing
that
you
should
come
upon
us
sitting
together
at
one
of
the
*NL*
little
tables
in
front
of
the
club
house
,
let
us
say
,
at
Homburg
,
taking
*NL*
tea
of
an
afternoon
and
watching
the
miniature
golf
,
you
would
have
said
*NL*
that
,
as
human
affairs
go
,
we
were
an
extraordinarily
safe
castle
.
We
*NL*
were
,
if
you
will
,
one
of
those
tall
ships
with
the
white
sails
upon
a
*NL*
blue
sea
,
one
of
those
things
that
seem
the
proudest
and
the
safest
of
*NL*
all
the
beautiful
and
safe
things
that
God
has
permitted
the
mind
of
men
*NL*
to
frame
.
Where
better
could
one
take
refuge
?
Where
better
?
*NL*
*NL*
Permanence
?
Stability
?
I
ca
n't
believe
it
's
gone
.
I
ca
n't
believe
that
*NL*
that
long
,
tranquil
life
,
which
was
just
stepping
a
minuet
,
vanished
in
*NL*
four
crashing
days
at
the
end
of
nine
years
and
six
weeks
.
Upon
my
word
,
*NL*
yes
,
our
intimacy
was
like
a
minuet
,
simply
because
on
every
possible
*NL*
occasion
and
in
every
possible
circumstance
we
knew
where
to
go
,
where
*NL*
to
sit
,
which
table
we
unanimously
should
choose
;
and
we
could
rise
and
*NL*
go
,
all
four
together
,
without
a
signal
from
any
one
of
us
,
always
to
*NL*
the
music
of
the
Kur
orchestra
,
always
in
the
temperate
sunshine
,
or
,
if
*NL*
it
rained
,
in
discreet
shelters
.
No
,
indeed
,
it
ca
n't
be
gone
.
You
ca
n't
*NL*
kill
a
minuet
de
la
cour
.
You
may
shut
up
the
music-book
,
close
the
*NL*
harpsichord
;
in
the
cupboard
and
presses
the
rats
may
destroy
the
white
*NL*
satin
favours
.
The
mob
may
sack
Versailles
;
the
Trianon
may
fall
,
but
*NL*
surely
the
minuet
--
the
minuet
itself
is
dancing
itself
away
into
the
*NL*
furthest
stars
,
even
as
our
minuet
of
the
Hessian
bathing
places
must
*NL*
be
stepping
itself
still
.
Is
n't
there
any
heaven
where
old
beautiful
*NL*
dances
,
old
beautiful
intimacies
prolong
themselves
?
Is
n't
there
any
*NL*
Nirvana
pervaded
by
the
faint
thrilling
of
instruments
that
have
*NL*
fallen
into
the
dust
of
wormwood
but
that
yet
had
frail
,
tremulous
,
and
*NL*
everlasting
souls
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
by
God
,
it
is
false
!
It
was
n't
a
minuet
that
we
stepped
;
it
was
a
*NL*
prison
--
a
prison
full
of
screaming
hysterics
,
tied
down
so
that
they
*NL*
might
not
outsound
the
rolling
of
our
carriage
wheels
as
we
went
along
*NL*
the
shaded
avenues
of
the
Taunus
Wald
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
I
swear
by
the
sacred
name
of
my
creator
that
it
was
true
.
It
*NL*
was
true
sunshine
;
the
true
music
;
the
true
splash
of
the
fountains
from
*NL*
the
mouth
of
stone
dolphins
.
For
,
if
for
me
we
were
four
people
with
the
*NL*
same
tastes
,
with
the
same
desires
,
acting
--
or
,
no
,
not
acting
--
sitting
*NL*
here
and
there
unanimously
,
is
n't
that
the
truth
?
If
for
nine
years
I
*NL*
have
possessed
a
goodly
apple
that
is
rotten
at
the
core
and
discover
*NL*
its
rottenness
only
in
nine
years
and
six
months
less
four
days
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
true
to
say
that
for
nine
years
I
possessed
a
goodly
apple
?
So
it
may
*NL*
well
be
with
Edward
Ashburnham
,
with
Leonora
his
wife
and
with
poor
dear
*NL*
Florence
.
And
,
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
,
is
n't
it
a
little
odd
that
*NL*
the
physical
rottenness
of
at
least
two
pillars
of
our
four-square
*NL*
house
never
presented
itself
to
my
mind
as
a
menace
to
its
security
?
It
*NL*
does
n't
so
present
itself
now
though
the
two
of
them
are
actually
dead
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
...
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
nothing
--
nothing
in
the
world
--
of
the
hearts
of
men
.
I
only
know
*NL*
that
I
am
alone
--
horribly
alone
.
No
hearthstone
will
ever
again
witness
,
*NL*
for
me
,
friendly
intercourse
.
No
smoking-room
will
ever
be
other
than
*NL*
peopled
with
incalculable
simulacra
amidst
smoke
wreaths
.
Yet
,
in
the
*NL*
name
of
God
,
what
should
I
know
if
I
do
n't
know
the
life
of
the
hearth
*NL*
and
of
the
smoking-room
,
since
my
whole
life
has
been
passed
in
those
*NL*
places
?
The
warm
hearthside
!
--
Well
,
there
was
Florence
:
I
believe
*NL*
that
for
the
twelve
years
her
life
lasted
,
after
the
storm
that
seemed
*NL*
irretrievably
to
have
weakened
her
heart
--
I
do
n't
believe
that
for
one
*NL*
minute
she
was
out
of
my
sight
,
except
when
she
was
safely
tucked
up
in
*NL*
bed
and
I
should
be
downstairs
,
talking
to
some
good
fellow
or
other
in
*NL*
some
lounge
or
smoking-room
or
taking
my
final
turn
with
a
cigar
before
*NL*
going
to
bed
.
I
do
n't
,
you
understand
,
blame
Florence
.
But
how
can
she
*NL*
have
known
what
she
knew
?
How
could
she
have
got
to
know
it
?
To
know
it
*NL*
so
fully
.
Heavens
!
There
does
n't
seem
to
have
been
the
actual
time
.
It
*NL*
must
have
been
when
I
was
taking
my
baths
,
and
my
Swedish
exercises
,
*NL*
being
manicured
.
Leading
the
life
I
did
,
of
the
sedulous
,
strained
*NL*
nurse
,
I
had
to
do
something
to
keep
myself
fit
.
It
must
have
been
then
!
*NL*
Yet
even
that
ca
n't
have
been
enough
time
to
get
the
tremendously
long
*NL*
conversations
full
of
worldly
wisdom
that
Leonora
has
reported
to
*NL*
me
since
their
deaths
.
And
is
it
possible
to
imagine
that
during
our
*NL*
prescribed
walks
in
Nauheim
and
the
neighbourhood
she
found
time
to
*NL*
carry
on
the
protracted
negotiations
which
she
did
carry
on
between
*NL*
Edward
Ashburnham
and
his
wife
?
And
is
n't
it
incredible
that
during
*NL*
all
that
time
Edward
and
Leonora
never
spoke
a
word
to
each
other
in
*NL*
private
?
What
is
one
to
think
of
humanity
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
I
swear
to
you
that
they
were
the
model
couple
.
He
was
as
devoted
*NL*
as
it
was
possible
to
be
without
appearing
fatuous
.
So
well
set
up
,
*NL*
with
such
honest
blue
eyes
,
such
a
touch
of
stupidity
,
such
a
warm
*NL*
goodheartedness
!
And
she
--
so
tall
,
so
splendid
in
the
saddle
,
so
fair
!
*NL*
Yes
,
Leonora
was
extraordinarily
fair
and
so
extraordinarily
the
real
*NL*
thing
that
she
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
.
You
do
n't
,
I
mean
,
as
a
rule
,
*NL*
get
it
all
so
superlatively
together
.
To
be
the
county
family
,
to
look
*NL*
the
county
family
,
to
be
so
appropriately
and
perfectly
wealthy
;
to
be
*NL*
so
perfect
in
manner
--
even
just
to
the
saving
touch
of
insolence
that
*NL*
seems
to
be
necessary
.
To
have
all
that
and
to
be
all
that
!
No
,
it
was
*NL*
too
good
to
be
true
.
And
yet
,
only
this
afternoon
,
talking
over
the
*NL*
whole
matter
she
said
to
me
:
``
Once
I
tried
to
have
a
lover
but
I
was
*NL*
so
sick
at
the
heart
,
so
utterly
worn
out
that
I
had
to
send
him
away
.
''
*NL*
That
struck
me
as
the
most
amazing
thing
I
had
ever
heard
.
She
said
``
I
*NL*
was
actually
in
a
man
's
arms
.
Such
a
nice
chap
!
Such
a
dear
fellow
!
And
*NL*
I
was
saying
to
myself
,
fiercely
,
hissing
it
between
my
teeth
,
as
they
*NL*
say
in
novels
--
and
really
clenching
them
together
:
I
was
saying
to
*NL*
myself
:
`
Now
,
I
'm
in
for
it
and
I
'll
really
have
a
good
time
for
once
in
*NL*
my
life
--
for
once
in
my
life
!
'
It
was
in
the
dark
,
in
a
carriage
,
coming
*NL*
back
from
a
hunt
ball
.
Eleven
miles
we
had
to
drive
!
And
then
suddenly
*NL*
the
bitterness
of
the
endless
poverty
,
of
the
endless
acting
--
it
fell
on
*NL*
me
like
a
blight
,
it
spoilt
everything
.
Yes
,
I
had
to
realize
that
I
had
*NL*
been
spoilt
even
for
the
good
time
when
it
came
.
And
I
burst
out
crying
*NL*
and
I
cried
and
I
cried
for
the
whole
eleven
miles
.
Just
imagine
me
*NL*
crying
!
And
just
imagine
me
making
a
fool
of
the
poor
dear
chap
like
*NL*
that
.
It
certainly
was
n't
playing
the
game
,
was
it
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
;
I
do
n't
know
;
was
that
last
remark
of
hers
the
remark
of
*NL*
a
harlot
,
or
is
it
what
every
decent
woman
,
county
family
or
not
county
*NL*
family
,
thinks
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
?
Or
thinks
all
the
time
for
*NL*
the
matter
of
that
?
Who
knows
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
if
one
does
n't
know
that
at
this
hour
and
day
,
at
this
pitch
of
*NL*
civilization
to
which
we
have
attained
,
after
all
the
preachings
of
*NL*
all
the
moralists
,
and
all
the
teachings
of
all
the
mothers
to
all
the
*NL*
daughters
in
saecula
saeculorum
...
but
perhaps
that
is
what
all
mothers
*NL*
teach
all
daughters
,
not
with
lips
but
with
the
eyes
,
or
with
heart
*NL*
whispering
to
heart
.
And
,
if
one
does
n't
know
as
much
as
that
about
the
*NL*
first
thing
in
the
world
,
what
does
one
know
and
why
is
one
here
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
Mrs
Ashburnham
whether
she
had
told
Florence
that
and
what
*NL*
Florence
had
said
and
she
answered
:
--
``
Florence
did
n't
offer
any
comment
*NL*
at
all
.
What
could
she
say
?
There
was
n't
anything
to
be
said
.
With
the
*NL*
grinding
poverty
we
had
to
put
up
with
to
keep
up
appearances
,
and
the
*NL*
way
the
poverty
came
about
--
you
know
what
I
mean
--
any
woman
would
have
*NL*
been
justified
in
taking
a
lover
and
presents
too
.
Florence
once
said
*NL*
about
a
very
similar
position
--
she
was
a
little
too
well-bred
,
too
*NL*
American
,
to
talk
about
mine
--
that
it
was
a
case
of
perfectly
open
*NL*
riding
and
the
woman
could
just
act
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
She
said
*NL*
it
in
American
of
course
,
but
that
was
the
sense
of
it
.
I
think
her
*NL*
actual
words
were
:
`
That
it
was
up
to
her
to
take
it
or
leave
it
...
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
you
to
think
that
I
am
writing
Teddy
Ashburnham
down
a
*NL*
brute
.
I
do
n't
believe
he
was
.
God
knows
,
perhaps
all
men
are
like
that
.
*NL*
For
as
I
've
said
what
do
I
know
even
of
the
smoking-room
?
Fellows
come
*NL*
in
and
tell
the
most
extraordinarily
gross
stories
--
so
gross
that
they
*NL*
will
positively
give
you
a
pain
.
And
yet
they
'd
be
offended
if
you
*NL*
suggested
that
they
were
n't
the
sort
of
person
you
could
trust
your
wife
*NL*
alone
with
.
And
very
likely
they
'd
be
quite
properly
offended
--
that
is
*NL*
if
you
can
trust
anybody
alone
with
anybody
.
But
that
sort
of
fellow
*NL*
obviously
takes
more
delight
in
listening
to
or
in
telling
gross
*NL*
stories
--
more
delight
than
in
anything
else
in
the
world
.
They
'll
*NL*
hunt
languidly
and
dress
languidly
and
dine
languidly
and
work
without
*NL*
enthusiasm
and
find
it
a
bore
to
carry
on
three
minutes
'
conversation
*NL*
about
anything
whatever
and
yet
,
when
the
other
sort
of
conversation
*NL*
begins
,
they
'll
laugh
and
wake
up
and
throw
themselves
about
in
their
*NL*
chairs
.
Then
,
if
they
so
delight
in
the
narration
,
how
is
it
possible
*NL*
that
they
can
be
offended
--
and
properly
offended
--
at
the
suggestion
*NL*
that
they
might
make
attempts
upon
your
wife
's
honour
?
Or
again
:
*NL*
Edward
Ashburnham
was
the
cleanest
looking
sort
of
chap
;
--
an
excellent
*NL*
magistrate
,
a
first
rate
soldier
,
one
of
the
best
landlords
,
so
they
*NL*
said
,
in
Hampshire
,
England
.
To
the
poor
and
to
hopeless
drunkards
,
as
I
*NL*
myself
have
witnessed
,
he
was
like
a
painstaking
guardian
.
And
he
never
*NL*
told
a
story
that
could
n't
have
gone
into
the
columns
of
the
Field
more
*NL*
than
once
or
twice
in
all
the
nine
years
of
my
knowing
him
.
He
did
n't
*NL*
even
like
hearing
them
;
he
would
fidget
and
get
up
and
go
out
to
buy
a
*NL*
cigar
or
something
of
that
sort
.
You
would
have
said
that
he
was
just
*NL*
exactly
the
sort
of
chap
that
you
could
have
trusted
your
wife
with
.
And
*NL*
I
trusted
mine
and
it
was
madness
.
And
yet
again
you
have
me
.
If
poor
*NL*
Edward
was
dangerous
because
of
the
chastity
of
his
expressions
--
and
*NL*
they
say
that
is
always
the
hall-mark
of
a
libertine
--
what
about
myself
?
*NL*
For
I
solemnly
avow
that
not
only
have
I
never
so
much
as
hinted
at
an
*NL*
impropriety
in
my
conversation
in
the
whole
of
my
days
;
and
more
than
*NL*
that
,
I
will
vouch
for
the
cleanness
of
my
thoughts
and
the
absolute
*NL*
chastity
of
my
life
.
At
what
,
then
,
does
it
all
work
out
?
Is
the
whole
*NL*
thing
a
folly
and
a
mockery
?
Am
I
no
better
than
a
eunuch
or
is
the
*NL*
proper
man
--
the
man
with
the
right
to
existence
--
a
raging
stallion
*NL*
forever
neighing
after
his
neighbour
's
womankind
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
.
And
there
is
nothing
to
guide
us
.
And
if
everything
is
*NL*
so
nebulous
about
a
matter
so
elementary
as
the
morals
of
sex
,
what
*NL*
is
there
to
guide
us
in
the
more
subtle
morality
of
all
other
personal
*NL*
contacts
,
associations
,
and
activities
?
Or
are
we
meant
to
act
on
*NL*
impulse
alone
?
It
is
all
a
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
I
DO
N'T
know
how
it
is
best
to
put
this
thing
down
--
whether
it
would
*NL*
be
better
to
try
and
tell
the
story
from
the
beginning
,
as
if
it
were
a
*NL*
story
;
or
whether
to
tell
it
from
this
distance
of
time
,
as
it
reached
*NL*
me
from
the
lips
of
Leonora
or
from
those
of
Edward
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
shall
just
imagine
myself
for
a
fortnight
or
so
at
one
side
of
the
*NL*
fireplace
of
a
country
cottage
,
with
a
sympathetic
soul
opposite
me
.
*NL*
And
I
shall
go
on
talking
,
in
a
low
voice
while
the
sea
sounds
in
the
*NL*
distance
and
overhead
the
great
black
flood
of
wind
polishes
the
bright
*NL*
stars
.
From
time
to
time
we
shall
get
up
and
go
to
the
door
and
look
out
*NL*
at
the
great
moon
and
say
:
``
Why
,
it
is
nearly
as
bright
as
in
Provence
!
''
*NL*
And
then
we
shall
come
back
to
the
fireside
,
with
just
the
touch
of
a
*NL*
sigh
because
we
are
not
in
that
Provence
where
even
the
saddest
stories
*NL*
are
gay
.
Consider
the
lamentable
history
of
Peire
Vidal
.
Two
years
ago
*NL*
Florence
and
I
motored
from
Biarritz
to
Las
Tours
,
which
is
in
the
Black
*NL*
Mountains
.
In
the
middle
of
a
tortuous
valley
there
rises
up
an
immense
*NL*
pinnacle
and
on
the
pinnacle
are
four
castles
--
Las
Tours
,
the
Towers
.
*NL*
And
the
immense
mistral
blew
down
that
valley
which
was
the
way
from
*NL*
France
into
Provence
so
that
the
silver
grey
olive
leaves
appeared
like
*NL*
hair
flying
in
the
wind
,
and
the
tufts
of
rosemary
crept
into
the
iron
*NL*
rocks
that
they
might
not
be
torn
up
by
the
roots
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
of
course
,
poor
dear
Florence
who
wanted
to
go
to
Las
Tours
.
*NL*
You
are
to
imagine
that
,
however
much
her
bright
personality
came
from
*NL*
Stamford
,
Connecticut
,
she
was
yet
a
graduate
of
Poughkeepsie
.
I
never
*NL*
could
imagine
how
she
did
it
--
the
queer
,
chattery
person
that
she
was
.
*NL*
With
the
far-away
look
in
her
eyes
--
which
was
n't
,
however
,
in
the
least
*NL*
romantic
--
I
mean
that
she
did
n't
look
as
if
she
were
seeing
poetic
*NL*
dreams
,
or
looking
through
you
,
for
she
hardly
ever
did
look
at
*NL*
you
!
--
holding
up
one
hand
as
if
she
wished
to
silence
any
objection
--
or
*NL*
any
comment
for
the
matter
of
that
--
she
would
talk
.
She
would
talk
about
*NL*
William
the
Silent
,
about
Gustave
the
Loquacious
,
about
Paris
frocks
,
*NL*
about
how
the
poor
dressed
in
1337
,
about
Fantin-Latour
,
about
the
*NL*
Paris-Lyons-Mediterranee
train-deluxe
,
about
whether
it
would
be
*NL*
worth
while
to
get
off
at
Tarascon
and
go
across
the
windswept
*NL*
suspension-bridge
,
over
the
Rhone
to
take
another
look
at
Beaucaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
never
did
take
another
look
at
Beaucaire
,
of
course
--
beautiful
*NL*
Beaucaire
,
with
the
high
,
triangular
white
tower
,
that
looked
as
thin
*NL*
as
a
needle
and
as
tall
as
the
Flatiron
,
between
Fifth
and
*NL*
Broadway
--
Beaucaire
with
the
grey
walls
on
the
top
of
the
pinnacle
*NL*
surrounding
an
acre
and
a
half
of
blue
irises
,
beneath
the
tallness
of
*NL*
the
stone
pines
,
What
a
beautiful
thing
the
stone
pine
is
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
we
never
did
go
back
anywhere
.
Not
to
Heidelberg
,
not
to
Hamelin
,
*NL*
not
to
Verona
,
not
to
Mont
Majour
--
not
so
much
as
to
Carcassonne
itself
.
*NL*
We
talked
of
it
,
of
course
,
but
I
guess
Florence
got
all
she
wanted
out
*NL*
of
one
look
at
a
place
.
She
had
the
seeing
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
n't
,
unfortunately
,
so
that
the
world
is
full
of
places
to
which
I
*NL*
want
to
return
--
towns
with
the
blinding
white
sun
upon
them
;
stone
pines
*NL*
against
the
blue
of
the
sky
;
corners
of
gables
,
all
carved
and
painted
*NL*
with
stags
and
scarlet
flowers
and
crowstepped
gables
with
the
little
*NL*
saint
at
the
top
;
and
grey
and
pink
palazzi
and
walled
towns
a
mile
or
*NL*
so
back
from
the
sea
,
on
the
Mediterranean
,
between
Leghorn
and
Naples
.
*NL*
Not
one
of
them
did
we
see
more
than
once
,
so
that
the
whole
world
for
*NL*
me
is
like
spots
of
colour
in
an
immense
canvas
.
Perhaps
if
it
were
n't
*NL*
so
I
should
have
something
to
catch
hold
of
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
all
this
digression
or
is
n't
it
digression
?
Again
I
do
n't
know
.
You
,
*NL*
the
listener
,
sit
opposite
me
.
But
you
are
so
silent
.
You
do
n't
tell
me
*NL*
anything
.
I
am
,
at
any
rate
,
trying
to
get
you
to
see
what
sort
of
life
*NL*
it
was
I
led
with
Florence
and
what
Florence
was
like
.
Well
,
she
was
*NL*
bright
;
and
she
danced
.
She
seemed
to
dance
over
the
floors
of
castles
*NL*
and
over
seas
and
over
and
over
and
over
the
salons
of
modistes
and
over
*NL*
the
plages
of
the
Riviera
--
like
a
gay
tremulous
beam
,
reflected
from
*NL*
water
upon
a
ceiling
.
And
my
function
in
life
was
to
keep
that
bright
*NL*
thing
in
existence
.
And
it
was
almost
as
difficult
as
trying
to
catch
*NL*
with
your
hand
that
dancing
reflection
.
And
the
task
lasted
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Florence
's
aunts
used
to
say
that
I
must
be
the
laziest
man
in
*NL*
Philadelphia
.
They
had
never
been
to
Philadelphia
and
they
had
the
New
*NL*
England
conscience
.
You
see
,
the
first
thing
they
said
to
me
when
I
*NL*
called
in
on
Florence
in
the
little
ancient
,
colonial
,
wooden
house
*NL*
beneath
the
high
,
thin-leaved
elms
--
the
first
question
they
asked
me
was
*NL*
not
how
I
did
but
what
did
I
do
.
And
I
did
nothing
.
I
suppose
I
ought
to
*NL*
have
done
something
,
but
I
did
n't
see
any
call
to
do
it
.
Why
does
one
do
*NL*
things
?
I
just
drifted
in
and
wanted
Florence
.
First
I
had
drifted
in
*NL*
on
Florence
at
a
Browning
tea
,
or
something
of
the
sort
in
Fourteenth
*NL*
Street
,
which
was
then
still
residential
.
I
do
n't
know
why
I
had
gone
*NL*
to
New
York
;
I
do
n't
know
why
I
had
gone
to
the
tea
.
I
do
n't
see
why
*NL*
Florence
should
have
gone
to
that
sort
of
spelling
bee
.
It
was
n't
the
*NL*
place
at
which
,
even
then
,
you
expected
to
find
a
Poughkeepsie
graduate
.
*NL*
I
guess
Florence
wanted
to
raise
the
culture
of
the
Stuyvesant
crowd
and
*NL*
did
it
as
she
might
have
gone
in
slumming
.
Intellectual
slumming
,
that
*NL*
was
what
it
was
.
She
always
wanted
to
leave
the
world
a
little
more
*NL*
elevated
than
she
found
it
.
Poor
dear
thing
,
I
have
heard
her
lecture
*NL*
Teddy
Ashburnham
by
the
hour
on
the
difference
between
a
Franz
Hals
and
*NL*
a
Wouvermans
and
why
the
Pre-Mycenaean
statues
were
cubical
with
knobs
*NL*
on
the
top
.
I
wonder
what
he
made
of
it
?
Perhaps
he
was
thankful
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
I
was
.
For
do
you
understand
my
whole
attentions
,
my
whole
*NL*
endeavours
were
to
keep
poor
dear
Florence
on
to
topics
like
the
finds
*NL*
at
Cnossos
and
the
mental
spirituality
of
Walter
Pater
.
I
had
to
keep
*NL*
her
at
it
,
you
understand
,
or
she
might
die
.
For
I
was
solemnly
informed
*NL*
that
if
she
became
excited
over
anything
or
if
her
emotions
were
really
*NL*
stirred
her
little
heart
might
cease
to
beat
.
For
twelve
years
I
had
to
*NL*
watch
every
word
that
any
person
uttered
in
any
conversation
and
I
had
*NL*
to
head
it
off
what
the
English
call
``
things
''
--
off
love
,
poverty
,
crime
,
*NL*
religion
and
the
rest
of
it
.
Yes
,
the
first
doctor
that
we
had
when
she
*NL*
was
carried
off
the
ship
at
Havre
assured
me
that
this
must
be
done
.
*NL*
Good
God
,
are
all
these
fellows
monstrous
idiots
,
or
is
there
a
*NL*
freemasonry
between
all
of
them
from
end
to
end
of
the
earth
?
...
That
is
*NL*
what
makes
me
think
of
that
fellow
Peire
Vidal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Because
,
of
course
,
his
story
is
culture
and
I
had
to
head
her
towards
*NL*
culture
and
at
the
same
time
it
's
so
funny
and
she
had
n't
got
to
laugh
,
*NL*
and
it
's
so
full
of
love
and
she
was
n't
to
think
of
love
.
Do
you
know
*NL*
the
story
?
Las
Tours
of
the
Four
Castles
had
for
chatelaine
Blanche
*NL*
Somebody-or-other
who
was
called
as
a
term
of
commendation
,
La
*NL*
Louve
--
the
She-Wolf
.
And
Peire
Vidal
the
Troubadour
paid
his
court
to
*NL*
La
Louve
.
And
she
would
n't
have
anything
to
do
with
him
.
So
,
out
of
*NL*
compliment
to
her
--
the
things
people
do
when
they
're
in
love
!
--
he
*NL*
dressed
himself
up
in
wolfskins
and
went
up
into
the
Black
Mountains
.
*NL*
And
the
shepherds
of
the
Montagne
Noire
and
their
dogs
mistook
him
for
*NL*
a
wolf
and
he
was
torn
with
the
fangs
and
beaten
with
clubs
.
So
they
*NL*
carried
him
back
to
Las
Tours
and
La
Louve
was
n't
at
all
impressed
.
They
*NL*
polished
him
up
and
her
husband
remonstrated
seriously
with
her
.
Vidal
*NL*
was
,
you
see
,
a
great
poet
and
it
was
not
proper
to
treat
a
great
poet
*NL*
with
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Peire
Vidal
declared
himself
Emperor
of
Jerusalem
or
somewhere
*NL*
and
the
husband
had
to
kneel
down
and
kiss
his
feet
though
La
Louve
*NL*
would
n't
.
And
Peire
set
sail
in
a
rowing
boat
with
four
companions
to
*NL*
redeem
the
Holy
Sepulchre
.
And
they
struck
on
a
rock
somewhere
,
and
,
*NL*
at
great
expense
,
the
husband
had
to
fit
out
an
expedition
to
fetch
him
*NL*
back
.
And
Peire
Vidal
fell
all
over
the
Lady
's
bed
while
the
husband
,
*NL*
who
was
a
most
ferocious
warrior
,
remonstrated
some
more
about
the
*NL*
courtesy
that
is
due
to
great
poets
.
But
I
suppose
La
Louve
was
the
more
*NL*
ferocious
of
the
two
.
Anyhow
,
that
is
all
that
came
of
it
.
Is
n't
that
a
*NL*
story
?
*NL*
*NL*
You
have
n't
an
idea
of
the
queer
old-fashionedness
of
Florence
's
*NL*
aunts
--
the
Misses
Hurlbird
,
nor
yet
of
her
uncle
.
An
extraordinarily
*NL*
lovable
man
,
that
Uncle
John
.
Thin
,
gentle
,
and
with
a
``
heart
''
that
made
*NL*
his
life
very
much
what
Florence
's
afterwards
became
.
He
did
n't
reside
*NL*
at
Stamford
;
his
home
was
in
Waterbury
where
the
watches
come
from
.
He
*NL*
had
a
factory
there
which
,
in
our
queer
American
way
,
would
change
*NL*
its
functions
almost
from
year
to
year
.
For
nine
months
or
so
it
would
*NL*
manufacture
buttons
out
of
bone
.
Then
it
would
suddenly
produce
brass
*NL*
buttons
for
coachmen
's
liveries
.
Then
it
would
take
a
turn
at
embossed
*NL*
tin
lids
for
candy
boxes
.
The
fact
is
that
the
poor
old
gentleman
,
with
*NL*
his
weak
and
fluttering
heart
,
did
n't
want
his
factory
to
manufacture
*NL*
anything
at
all
.
He
wanted
to
retire
.
And
he
did
retire
when
he
was
*NL*
seventy
.
But
he
was
so
worried
at
having
all
the
street
boys
in
the
town
*NL*
point
after
him
and
exclaim
:
``
There
goes
the
laziest
man
in
Waterbury
!
''
*NL*
that
he
tried
taking
a
tour
round
the
world
.
And
Florence
and
a
young
*NL*
man
called
Jimmy
went
with
him
.
It
appears
from
what
Florence
told
me
*NL*
that
Jimmy
's
function
with
Mr
Hurlbird
was
to
avoid
exciting
topics
for
*NL*
him
.
He
had
to
keep
him
,
for
instance
,
out
of
political
discussions
.
For
*NL*
the
poor
old
man
was
a
violent
Democrat
in
days
when
you
might
travel
*NL*
the
world
over
without
finding
anything
but
a
Republican
.
Anyhow
,
they
*NL*
went
round
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
an
anecdote
is
about
the
best
way
to
give
you
an
idea
of
what
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
was
like
.
For
it
is
perhaps
important
that
you
should
*NL*
know
what
the
old
gentleman
was
;
he
had
a
great
deal
of
influence
in
*NL*
forming
the
character
of
my
poor
dear
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
before
they
set
out
from
San
Francisco
for
the
South
Seas
old
Mr
*NL*
Hurlbird
said
he
must
take
something
with
him
to
make
little
presents
to
*NL*
people
he
met
on
the
voyage
.
And
it
struck
him
that
the
things
to
*NL*
take
for
that
purpose
were
oranges
--
because
California
is
the
orange
*NL*
country
--
and
comfortable
folding
chairs
.
So
he
bought
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
many
cases
of
oranges
--
the
great
cool
California
oranges
,
and
*NL*
half-a-dozen
folding
chairs
in
a
special
case
that
he
always
kept
in
his
*NL*
cabin
.
There
must
have
been
half
a
cargo
of
fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
to
every
person
on
board
the
several
steamers
that
they
*NL*
employed
--
to
every
person
with
whom
he
had
so
much
as
a
nodding
*NL*
acquaintance
,
he
gave
an
orange
every
morning
.
And
they
lasted
him
right
*NL*
round
the
girdle
of
this
mighty
globe
of
ours
.
When
they
were
at
North
*NL*
Cape
,
even
,
he
saw
on
the
horizon
,
poor
dear
thin
man
that
he
was
,
a
*NL*
lighthouse
.
``
Hello
,
''
says
he
to
himself
,
``
these
fellows
must
be
very
*NL*
lonely
.
Let
's
take
them
some
oranges
.
''
So
he
had
a
boatload
of
his
fruit
*NL*
out
and
had
himself
rowed
to
the
lighthouse
on
the
horizon
.
The
folding
*NL*
chairs
he
lent
to
any
lady
that
he
came
across
and
liked
or
who
seemed
*NL*
tired
and
invalidish
on
the
ship
.
And
so
,
guarded
against
his
heart
and
,
*NL*
having
his
niece
with
him
,
he
went
round
the
world
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
n't
obtrusive
about
his
heart
.
You
would
n't
have
known
he
had
one
.
*NL*
He
only
left
it
to
the
physical
laboratory
at
Waterbury
for
the
benefit
*NL*
of
science
,
since
he
considered
it
to
be
quite
an
extraordinary
kind
*NL*
of
heart
.
And
the
joke
of
the
matter
was
that
,
when
,
at
the
age
of
*NL*
eighty-four
,
just
five
days
before
poor
Florence
,
he
died
of
bronchitis
*NL*
there
was
found
to
be
absolutely
nothing
the
matter
with
that
organ
.
It
*NL*
had
certainly
jumped
or
squeaked
or
something
just
sufficiently
to
take
*NL*
in
the
doctors
,
but
it
appears
that
that
was
because
of
an
odd
formation
*NL*
of
the
lungs
.
I
do
n't
much
understand
about
these
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
inherited
his
money
because
Florence
died
five
days
after
him
.
I
wish
*NL*
I
had
n't
.
It
was
a
great
worry
.
I
had
to
go
out
to
Waterbury
just
after
*NL*
Florence
's
death
because
the
poor
dear
old
fellow
had
left
a
good
many
*NL*
charitable
bequests
and
I
had
to
appoint
trustees
.
I
did
n't
like
the
*NL*
idea
of
their
not
being
properly
handled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
a
great
worry
.
And
just
as
I
had
got
things
roughly
settled
*NL*
I
received
the
extraordinary
cable
from
Ashburnham
begging
me
to
come
*NL*
back
and
have
a
talk
with
him
.
And
immediately
afterwards
came
one
from
*NL*
Leonora
saying
,
``
Yes
,
please
do
come
.
You
could
be
so
helpful
.
''
It
was
*NL*
as
if
he
had
sent
the
cable
without
consulting
her
and
had
afterwards
*NL*
told
her
.
Indeed
,
that
was
pretty
much
what
had
happened
,
except
that
*NL*
he
had
told
the
girl
and
the
girl
told
the
wife
.
I
arrived
,
however
,
too
*NL*
late
to
be
of
any
good
if
I
could
have
been
of
any
good
.
And
then
I
had
*NL*
my
first
taste
of
English
life
.
It
was
amazing
.
It
was
overwhelming
.
I
*NL*
never
shall
forget
the
polished
cob
that
Edward
,
beside
me
,
drove
;
the
*NL*
animal
's
action
,
its
high-stepping
,
its
skin
that
was
like
satin
.
And
*NL*
the
peace
!
And
the
red
cheeks
!
And
the
beautiful
,
beautiful
old
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
near
Branshaw
Teleragh
it
was
and
we
descended
on
it
from
the
high
,
*NL*
clear
,
windswept
waste
of
the
New
Forest
.
I
tell
you
it
was
amazing
*NL*
to
arrive
there
from
Waterbury
.
And
it
came
into
my
head
--
for
Teddy
*NL*
Ashburnham
,
you
remember
,
had
cabled
to
me
to
``
come
and
have
a
talk
''
*NL*
with
him
--
that
it
was
unbelievable
that
anything
essentially
calamitous
*NL*
could
happen
to
that
place
and
those
people
.
I
tell
you
it
was
the
very
*NL*
spirit
of
peace
.
And
Leonora
,
beautiful
and
smiling
,
with
her
coils
of
*NL*
yellow
hair
,
stood
on
the
top
doorstep
,
with
a
butler
and
footman
and
a
*NL*
maid
or
so
behind
her
.
And
she
just
said
:
``
So
glad
you
've
come
,
''
as
if
*NL*
I
'd
run
down
to
lunch
from
a
town
ten
miles
away
,
instead
of
having
come
*NL*
half
the
world
over
at
the
call
of
two
urgent
telegrams
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
was
out
with
the
hounds
,
I
think
.
And
that
poor
devil
beside
me
*NL*
was
in
an
agony
.
Absolute
,
hopeless
,
dumb
agony
such
as
passes
the
mind
*NL*
of
man
to
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
a
very
hot
summer
,
in
August
,
1904
;
and
Florence
had
already
been
*NL*
taking
the
baths
for
a
month
.
I
do
n't
know
how
it
feels
to
be
a
patient
*NL*
at
one
of
those
places
.
I
never
was
a
patient
anywhere
.
I
daresay
the
*NL*
patients
get
a
home
feeling
and
some
sort
of
anchorage
in
the
spot
.
They
*NL*
seem
to
like
the
bath
attendants
,
with
their
cheerful
faces
,
their
air
*NL*
of
authority
,
their
white
linen
.
But
,
for
myself
,
to
be
at
Nauheim
*NL*
gave
me
a
sense
--
what
shall
I
say
?
--
a
sense
almost
of
nakedness
--
the
*NL*
nakedness
that
one
feels
on
the
sea-shore
or
in
any
great
open
space
.
*NL*
I
had
no
attachments
,
no
accumulations
.
In
one
's
own
home
it
is
as
if
*NL*
little
,
innate
sympathies
draw
one
to
particular
chairs
that
seem
to
*NL*
enfold
one
in
an
embrace
,
or
take
one
along
particular
streets
that
seem
*NL*
friendly
when
others
may
be
hostile
.
And
,
believe
me
,
that
feeling
is
a
*NL*
very
important
part
of
life
.
I
know
it
well
,
that
have
been
for
so
long
*NL*
a
wanderer
upon
the
face
of
public
resorts
.
And
one
is
too
polished
up
.
*NL*
Heaven
knows
I
was
never
an
untidy
man
.
But
the
feeling
that
I
had
*NL*
when
,
whilst
poor
Florence
was
taking
her
morning
bath
,
I
stood
upon
the
*NL*
carefully
swept
steps
of
the
Englischer
Hof
,
looking
at
the
carefully
*NL*
arranged
trees
in
tubs
upon
the
carefully
arranged
gravel
whilst
*NL*
carefully
arranged
people
walked
past
in
carefully
calculated
gaiety
,
*NL*
at
the
carefully
calculated
hour
,
the
tall
trees
of
the
public
gardens
,
*NL*
going
up
to
the
right
;
the
reddish
stone
of
the
baths
--
or
were
they
*NL*
white
half-timber
chalets
?
Upon
my
word
I
have
forgotten
,
I
who
was
*NL*
there
so
often
.
That
will
give
you
the
measure
of
how
much
I
was
in
*NL*
the
landscape
.
I
could
find
my
way
blindfolded
to
the
hot
rooms
,
to
the
*NL*
douche
rooms
,
to
the
fountain
in
the
centre
of
the
quadrangle
where
the
*NL*
rusty
water
gushes
out
.
Yes
,
I
could
find
my
way
blindfolded
.
I
know
*NL*
the
exact
distances
.
From
the
Hotel
Regina
you
took
one
hundred
and
*NL*
eighty-seven
paces
,
then
,
turning
sharp
,
left-handed
,
four
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty
took
you
straight
down
to
the
fountain
.
From
the
Englischer
Hof
,
*NL*
starting
on
the
sidewalk
,
it
was
ninety-seven
paces
and
the
same
four
*NL*
hundred
and
twenty
,
but
turning
lefthanded
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
you
understand
that
,
having
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
--
but
*NL*
nothing
whatever
!
I
fell
into
the
habit
of
counting
my
footsteps
.
I
*NL*
would
walk
with
Florence
to
the
baths
.
And
,
of
course
,
she
entertained
*NL*
me
with
her
conversation
.
It
was
,
as
I
have
said
,
wonderful
what
she
*NL*
could
make
conversation
out
of
.
She
walked
very
lightly
,
and
her
hair
*NL*
was
very
nicely
done
,
and
she
dressed
beautifully
and
very
expensively
.
*NL*
Of
course
she
had
money
of
her
own
,
but
I
should
n't
have
minded
.
And
yet
*NL*
you
know
I
ca
n't
remember
a
single
one
of
her
dresses
.
Or
I
can
*NL*
remember
just
one
,
a
very
simple
one
of
blue
figured
silk
--
a
Chinese
*NL*
pattern
--
very
full
in
the
skirts
and
broadening
out
over
the
shoulders
.
*NL*
And
her
hair
was
copper-coloured
,
and
the
heels
of
her
shoes
were
*NL*
exceedingly
high
,
so
that
she
tripped
upon
the
points
of
her
toes
.
And
*NL*
when
she
came
to
the
door
of
the
bathing
place
,
and
when
it
opened
to
*NL*
receive
her
,
she
would
look
back
at
me
with
a
little
coquettish
smile
,
*NL*
so
that
her
cheek
appeared
to
be
caressing
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
seem
to
remember
that
,
with
that
dress
,
she
wore
an
immensely
broad
*NL*
Leghorn
hat
--
like
the
Chapeau
de
Paille
of
Rubens
,
only
very
white
.
The
*NL*
hat
would
be
tied
with
a
lightly
knotted
scarf
of
the
same
stuff
as
her
*NL*
dress
.
She
knew
how
to
give
value
to
her
blue
eyes
.
And
round
her
neck
*NL*
would
be
some
simple
pink
,
coral
beads
.
And
her
complexion
had
a
perfect
*NL*
clearness
,
a
perfect
smoothness
...
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
that
is
how
I
most
exactly
remember
her
,
in
that
dress
,
in
that
*NL*
hat
,
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
me
so
that
the
eyes
flashed
very
*NL*
blue
--
dark
pebble
blue
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
what
the
devil
!
For
whose
benefit
did
she
do
it
?
For
that
of
the
*NL*
bath
attendant
?
of
the
passers-by
?
I
do
n't
know
.
Anyhow
,
it
ca
n't
have
*NL*
been
for
me
,
for
never
,
in
all
the
years
of
her
life
,
never
on
any
*NL*
possible
occasion
,
or
in
any
other
place
did
she
so
smile
to
me
,
*NL*
mockingly
,
invitingly
.
Ah
,
she
was
a
riddle
;
but
then
,
all
other
women
*NL*
are
riddles
.
And
it
occurs
to
me
that
some
way
back
I
began
a
sentence
*NL*
that
I
have
never
finished
...
It
was
about
the
feeling
that
I
had
when
*NL*
I
stood
on
the
steps
of
my
hotel
every
morning
before
starting
out
*NL*
to
fetch
Florence
back
from
the
bath
.
Natty
,
precise
,
well-brushed
,
*NL*
conscious
of
being
rather
small
amongst
the
long
English
,
the
lank
*NL*
Americans
,
the
rotund
Germans
,
and
the
obese
Russian
Jewesses
,
I
should
*NL*
stand
there
,
tapping
a
cigarette
on
the
outside
of
my
case
,
surveying
*NL*
for
a
moment
the
world
in
the
sunlight
.
But
a
day
was
to
come
when
I
was
*NL*
never
to
do
it
again
alone
.
You
can
imagine
,
therefore
,
what
the
coming
*NL*
of
the
Ashburnhams
meant
to
me
.
I
have
forgotten
the
aspect
of
many
*NL*
things
,
but
I
shall
never
forget
the
aspect
of
the
dining-room
of
the
*NL*
Hotel
Excelsior
on
that
evening
--
and
on
so
many
other
evenings
.
Whole
*NL*
castles
have
vanished
from
my
memory
,
whole
cities
that
I
have
never
*NL*
visited
again
,
but
that
white
room
,
festooned
with
papier-mache
fruits
*NL*
and
flowers
;
the
tall
windows
;
the
many
tables
;
the
black
screen
round
*NL*
the
door
with
three
golden
cranes
flying
upward
on
each
panel
;
the
*NL*
palm-tree
in
the
centre
of
the
room
;
the
swish
of
the
waiter
's
feet
;
the
*NL*
cold
expensive
elegance
;
the
mien
of
the
diners
as
they
came
in
every
*NL*
evening
--
their
air
of
earnestness
as
if
they
must
go
through
a
meal
*NL*
prescribed
by
the
Kur
authorities
and
their
air
of
sobriety
as
if
they
*NL*
must
seek
not
by
any
means
to
enjoy
their
meals
--
those
things
I
shall
*NL*
not
easily
forget
.
And
then
,
one
evening
,
in
the
twilight
,
I
saw
Edward
*NL*
Ashburnham
lounge
round
the
screen
into
the
room
.
The
head
waiter
,
a
man
*NL*
with
a
face
all
grey
--
in
what
subterranean
nooks
or
corners
do
people
*NL*
cultivate
those
absolutely
grey
complexions
?
--
went
with
the
timorous
*NL*
patronage
of
these
creatures
towards
him
and
held
out
a
grey
ear
to
be
*NL*
whispered
into
.
It
was
generally
a
disagreeable
ordeal
for
newcomers
but
*NL*
Edward
Ashburnham
bore
it
like
an
Englishman
and
a
gentleman
.
I
could
*NL*
see
his
lips
form
a
word
of
three
syllables
--
remember
I
had
nothing
in
*NL*
the
world
to
do
but
to
notice
these
niceties
--
and
immediately
I
knew
*NL*
that
he
must
be
Edward
Ashburnham
,
Captain
,
Fourteenth
Hussars
,
of
*NL*
Branshaw
House
,
Branshaw
Teleragh
.
I
knew
it
because
every
evening
just
*NL*
before
dinner
,
whilst
I
waited
in
the
hall
,
I
used
,
by
the
courtesy
of
*NL*
Monsieur
Schontz
,
the
proprietor
,
to
inspect
the
little
police
reports
*NL*
that
each
guest
was
expected
to
sign
upon
taking
a
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
head
waiter
piloted
him
immediately
to
a
vacant
table
,
three
away
*NL*
from
my
own
--
the
table
that
the
Grenfalls
of
Falls
River
,
N.J.
,
had
*NL*
just
vacated
.
It
struck
me
that
that
was
not
a
very
nice
table
for
the
*NL*
newcomers
,
since
the
sunlight
,
low
though
it
was
,
shone
straight
down
*NL*
upon
it
,
and
the
same
idea
seemed
to
come
at
the
same
moment
into
*NL*
Captain
Ashburnham
's
head
.
His
face
hitherto
had
,
in
the
wonderful
*NL*
English
fashion
,
expressed
nothing
whatever
.
Nothing
.
There
was
in
it
*NL*
neither
joy
nor
despair
;
neither
hope
nor
fear
;
neither
boredom
nor
*NL*
satisfaction
.
He
seemed
to
perceive
no
soul
in
that
crowded
room
;
he
*NL*
might
have
been
walking
in
a
jungle
.
I
never
came
across
such
a
perfect
*NL*
expression
before
and
I
never
shall
again
.
It
was
insolence
and
*NL*
not
insolence
;
it
was
modesty
and
not
modesty
.
His
hair
was
fair
,
*NL*
extraordinarily
ordered
in
a
wave
,
running
from
the
left
temple
to
the
*NL*
right
;
his
face
was
a
light
brick-red
,
perfectly
uniform
in
tint
up
to
*NL*
the
roots
of
the
hair
itself
;
his
yellow
moustache
was
as
stiff
as
a
*NL*
toothbrush
and
I
verily
believe
that
he
had
his
black
smoking
jacket
*NL*
thickened
a
little
over
the
shoulder-blades
so
as
to
give
himself
the
*NL*
air
of
the
slightest
possible
stoop
.
It
would
be
like
him
to
do
that
;
*NL*
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
he
thought
about
.
Martingales
,
Chiffney
bits
,
*NL*
boots
;
where
you
got
the
best
soap
,
the
best
brandy
,
the
name
of
the
*NL*
chap
who
rode
a
plater
down
the
Khyber
cliffs
;
the
spreading
power
of
*NL*
number
three
shot
before
a
charge
of
number
four
powder
...
by
heavens
,
I
*NL*
hardly
ever
heard
him
talk
of
anything
else
.
Not
in
all
the
years
that
*NL*
I
knew
him
did
I
hear
him
talk
of
anything
but
these
subjects
.
Oh
,
yes
,
*NL*
once
he
told
me
that
I
could
buy
my
special
shade
of
blue
ties
cheaper
*NL*
from
a
firm
in
Burlington
Arcade
than
from
my
own
people
in
New
York
.
*NL*
And
I
have
bought
my
ties
from
that
firm
ever
since
.
Otherwise
I
should
*NL*
not
remember
the
name
of
the
Burlington
Arcade
.
I
wonder
what
it
looks
*NL*
like
.
I
have
never
seen
it
.
I
imagine
it
to
be
two
immense
rows
of
*NL*
pillars
,
like
those
of
the
Forum
at
Rome
,
with
Edward
Ashburnham
*NL*
striding
down
between
them
.
But
it
probably
is
n't
--
the
least
like
that
.
*NL*
Once
also
he
advised
me
to
buy
Caledonian
Deferred
,
since
they
were
due
*NL*
to
rise
.
And
I
did
buy
them
and
they
did
rise
.
But
of
how
he
got
the
*NL*
knowledge
I
have
n't
the
faintest
idea
.
It
seemed
to
drop
out
of
the
blue
*NL*
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
was
absolutely
all
that
I
knew
of
him
until
a
month
ago
--
that
*NL*
and
the
profusion
of
his
cases
,
all
of
pigskin
and
stamped
with
his
*NL*
initials
,
E.
F.
A
.
There
were
gun
cases
,
and
collar
cases
,
and
shirt
*NL*
cases
,
and
letter
cases
and
cases
each
containing
four
bottles
of
*NL*
medicine
;
and
hat
cases
and
helmet
cases
.
It
must
have
needed
a
whole
*NL*
herd
of
the
Gadarene
swine
to
make
up
his
outfit
.
And
,
if
I
ever
*NL*
penetrated
into
his
private
room
it
would
be
to
see
him
standing
,
with
*NL*
his
coat
and
waistcoat
off
and
the
immensely
long
line
of
his
perfectly
*NL*
elegant
trousers
from
waist
to
boot
heel
.
And
he
would
have
a
slightly
*NL*
reflective
air
and
he
would
be
just
opening
one
kind
of
case
and
just
*NL*
closing
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
God
,
what
did
they
all
see
in
him
?
for
I
swear
there
was
all
there
*NL*
was
of
him
,
inside
and
out
;
though
they
said
he
was
a
good
soldier
.
Yet
,
*NL*
Leonora
adored
him
with
a
passion
that
was
like
an
agony
,
and
hated
*NL*
him
with
an
agony
that
was
as
bitter
as
the
sea
.
How
could
he
arouse
*NL*
anything
like
a
sentiment
,
in
anybody
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
he
even
talk
to
them
about
--
when
they
were
under
four
*NL*
eyes
?
--
Ah
,
well
,
suddenly
,
as
if
by
a
flash
of
inspiration
,
I
know
.
For
*NL*
all
good
soldiers
are
sentimentalists
--
all
good
soldiers
of
that
type
.
*NL*
Their
profession
,
for
one
thing
,
is
full
of
the
big
words
,
courage
,
*NL*
loyalty
,
honour
,
constancy
.
And
I
have
given
a
wrong
impression
of
*NL*
Edward
Ashburnham
if
I
have
made
you
think
that
literally
never
in
the
*NL*
course
of
our
nine
years
of
intimacy
did
he
discuss
what
he
would
have
*NL*
called
``
the
graver
things
.
''
Even
before
his
final
outburst
to
me
,
at
*NL*
times
,
very
late
at
night
,
say
,
he
has
blurted
out
something
that
gave
*NL*
an
insight
into
the
sentimental
view
of
the
cosmos
that
was
his
.
*NL*
He
would
say
how
much
the
society
of
a
good
woman
could
do
towards
*NL*
redeeming
you
,
and
he
would
say
that
constancy
was
the
finest
of
*NL*
the
virtues
.
He
said
it
very
stiffly
,
of
course
,
but
still
as
if
the
*NL*
statement
admitted
of
no
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Constancy
!
Is
n't
that
the
queer
thought
?
And
yet
,
I
must
add
that
poor
*NL*
dear
Edward
was
a
great
reader
--
he
would
pass
hours
lost
in
novels
of
a
*NL*
sentimental
type
--
novels
in
which
typewriter
girls
married
Marquises
and
*NL*
governesses
Earls
.
And
in
his
books
,
as
a
rule
,
the
course
of
true
love
*NL*
ran
as
smooth
as
buttered
honey
.
And
he
was
fond
of
poetry
,
of
a
certain
*NL*
type
--
and
he
could
even
read
a
perfectly
sad
love
story
.
I
have
seen
his
*NL*
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
reading
of
a
hopeless
parting
.
And
he
loved
,
*NL*
with
a
sentimental
yearning
,
all
children
,
puppies
,
and
the
feeble
*NL*
generally
...
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
you
see
,
he
would
have
plenty
to
gurgle
about
to
a
woman
--
with
*NL*
that
and
his
sound
common
sense
about
martingales
and
his
--
still
*NL*
sentimental
--
experiences
as
a
county
magistrate
;
and
with
his
intense
,
*NL*
optimistic
belief
that
the
woman
he
was
making
love
to
at
the
moment
was
*NL*
the
one
he
was
destined
,
at
last
,
to
be
eternally
constant
to
...
Well
,
*NL*
I
fancy
he
could
put
up
a
pretty
good
deal
of
talk
when
there
was
no
*NL*
man
around
to
make
him
feel
shy
.
And
I
was
quite
astonished
,
during
his
*NL*
final
burst
out
to
me
--
at
the
very
end
of
things
,
when
the
poor
girl
was
*NL*
on
her
way
to
that
fatal
Brindisi
and
he
was
trying
to
persuade
himself
*NL*
and
me
that
he
had
never
really
cared
for
her
--
I
was
quite
astonished
to
*NL*
observe
how
literary
and
how
just
his
expressions
were
.
He
talked
like
*NL*
quite
a
good
book
--
a
book
not
in
the
least
cheaply
sentimental
.
You
see
,
*NL*
I
suppose
he
regarded
me
not
so
much
as
a
man
.
I
had
to
be
regarded
as
*NL*
a
woman
or
a
solicitor
.
Anyhow
,
it
burst
out
of
him
on
that
horrible
*NL*
night
.
And
then
,
next
morning
,
he
took
me
over
to
the
Assizes
and
I
saw
*NL*
how
,
in
a
perfectly
calm
and
business-like
way
,
he
set
to
work
to
secure
*NL*
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
for
a
poor
girl
,
the
daughter
of
one
of
his
*NL*
tenants
,
who
had
been
accused
of
murdering
her
baby
.
He
spent
two
*NL*
hundred
pounds
on
her
defence
...
Well
,
that
was
Edward
Ashburnham
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
forgotten
about
his
eyes
.
They
were
as
blue
as
the
sides
of
a
*NL*
certain
type
of
box
of
matches
.
When
you
looked
at
them
carefully
*NL*
you
saw
that
they
were
perfectly
honest
,
perfectly
straightforward
,
*NL*
perfectly
,
perfectly
stupid
.
But
the
brick
pink
of
his
complexion
,
*NL*
running
perfectly
level
to
the
brick
pink
of
his
inner
eyelids
,
gave
*NL*
them
a
curious
,
sinister
expression
--
like
a
mosaic
of
blue
porcelain
set
*NL*
in
pink
china
.
And
that
chap
,
coming
into
a
room
,
snapped
up
the
gaze
of
*NL*
every
woman
in
it
,
as
dexterously
as
a
conjurer
pockets
billiard
balls
.
*NL*
It
was
most
amazing
.
You
know
the
man
on
the
stage
who
throws
up
sixteen
*NL*
balls
at
once
and
they
all
drop
into
pockets
all
over
his
person
,
on
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
on
his
heels
,
on
the
inner
side
of
his
sleeves
;
and
he
stands
*NL*
perfectly
still
and
does
nothing
.
Well
,
it
was
like
that
.
He
had
rather
*NL*
a
rough
,
hoarse
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
there
he
was
,
standing
by
the
table
.
I
was
looking
at
him
,
with
my
*NL*
back
to
the
screen
.
And
suddenly
,
I
saw
two
distinct
expressions
*NL*
flicker
across
his
immobile
eyes
.
How
the
deuce
did
they
do
it
,
those
*NL*
unflinching
blue
eyes
with
the
direct
gaze
?
For
the
eyes
themselves
*NL*
never
moved
,
gazing
over
my
shoulder
towards
the
screen
.
And
the
gaze
*NL*
was
perfectly
level
and
perfectly
direct
and
perfectly
unchanging
.
I
*NL*
suppose
that
the
lids
really
must
have
rounded
themselves
a
little
and
*NL*
perhaps
the
lips
moved
a
little
too
,
as
if
he
should
be
saying
:
``
There
*NL*
you
are
,
my
dear
.
''
At
any
rate
,
the
expression
was
that
of
pride
,
of
*NL*
satisfaction
,
of
the
possessor
.
I
saw
him
once
afterwards
,
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
gaze
upon
the
sunny
fields
of
Branshaw
and
say
:
``
All
this
is
my
land
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
again
,
the
gaze
was
perhaps
more
direct
,
harder
if
*NL*
possible
--
hardy
too
.
It
was
a
measuring
look
;
a
challenging
look
.
Once
*NL*
when
we
were
at
Wiesbaden
watching
him
play
in
a
polo
match
against
the
*NL*
Bonner
Hussaren
I
saw
the
same
look
come
into
his
eyes
,
balancing
the
*NL*
possibilities
,
looking
over
the
ground
.
The
German
Captain
,
Count
Baron
*NL*
Idigon
von
Leloeffel
,
was
right
up
by
their
goal
posts
,
coming
with
the
*NL*
ball
in
an
easy
canter
in
that
tricky
German
fashion
.
The
rest
of
*NL*
the
field
were
just
anywhere
.
It
was
only
a
scratch
sort
of
affair
.
*NL*
Ashburnham
was
quite
close
to
the
rails
not
five
yards
from
us
and
*NL*
I
heard
him
saying
to
himself
:
``
Might
just
be
done
!
''
And
he
did
it
.
*NL*
Goodness
!
he
swung
that
pony
round
with
all
its
four
legs
spread
out
,
*NL*
like
a
cat
dropping
off
a
roof
...
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
was
just
that
look
that
I
noticed
in
his
eyes
:
``
It
might
,
''
I
*NL*
seem
even
now
to
hear
him
muttering
to
himself
,
``
just
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
round
over
my
shoulder
and
saw
,
tall
,
smiling
brilliantly
and
*NL*
buoyant
--
Leonora
.
And
,
little
and
fair
,
and
as
radiant
as
the
track
of
*NL*
sunlight
along
the
sea
--
my
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
poor
wretch
!
to
think
that
he
was
at
that
moment
in
a
perfect
devil
*NL*
of
a
fix
,
and
there
he
was
,
saying
at
the
back
of
his
mind
:
``
It
might
*NL*
just
be
done
.
''
It
was
like
a
chap
in
the
middle
of
the
eruption
of
a
*NL*
volcano
,
saying
that
he
might
just
manage
to
bolt
into
the
tumult
and
*NL*
set
fire
to
a
haystack
.
Madness
?
Predestination
?
Who
the
devil
knows
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Ashburnham
exhibited
at
that
moment
more
gaiety
than
I
have
*NL*
ever
since
known
her
to
show
.
There
are
certain
classes
of
English
*NL*
people
--
the
nicer
ones
when
they
have
been
to
many
spas
,
who
seem
to
*NL*
make
a
point
of
becoming
much
more
than
usually
animated
when
they
are
*NL*
introduced
to
my
compatriots
.
I
have
noticed
this
often
.
Of
course
,
they
*NL*
must
first
have
accepted
the
Americans
.
But
that
once
done
,
they
seem
to
*NL*
say
to
themselves
:
``
Hallo
,
these
women
are
so
bright
.
We
are
n't
going
to
*NL*
be
outdone
in
brightness
.
''
And
for
the
time
being
they
certainly
are
n't
.
*NL*
But
it
wears
off
.
So
it
was
with
Leonora
--
at
least
until
she
noticed
me
.
*NL*
She
began
,
Leonora
did
--
and
perhaps
it
was
that
that
gave
me
the
idea
of
*NL*
a
touch
of
insolence
in
her
character
,
for
she
never
afterwards
did
any
*NL*
one
single
thing
like
it
--
she
began
by
saying
in
quite
a
loud
voice
and
*NL*
from
quite
a
distance
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
stop
over
by
that
stuffy
old
table
,
Teddy
.
Come
and
sit
by
these
*NL*
nice
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
was
an
extraordinary
thing
to
say
.
Quite
extraordinary
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
for
the
life
of
me
refer
to
total
strangers
as
nice
people
.
*NL*
But
,
of
course
,
she
was
taking
a
line
of
her
own
in
which
I
at
any
*NL*
rate
--
and
no
one
else
in
the
room
,
for
she
too
had
taken
the
trouble
to
*NL*
read
through
the
list
of
guests
--
counted
any
more
than
so
many
clean
,
*NL*
bull
terriers
.
And
she
sat
down
rather
brilliantly
at
a
vacant
table
,
*NL*
beside
ours
--
one
that
was
reserved
for
the
Guggenheimers
.
And
she
just
*NL*
sat
absolutely
deaf
to
the
remonstrances
of
the
head
waiter
with
his
*NL*
face
like
a
grey
ram
's
.
That
poor
chap
was
doing
his
steadfast
duty
too
.
*NL*
He
knew
that
the
Guggenheimers
of
Chicago
,
after
they
had
stayed
there
*NL*
a
month
and
had
worried
the
poor
life
out
of
him
,
would
give
him
two
*NL*
dollars
fifty
and
grumble
at
the
tipping
system
.
And
he
knew
that
Teddy
*NL*
Ashburnham
and
his
wife
would
give
him
no
trouble
whatever
except
what
*NL*
the
smiles
of
Leonora
might
cause
in
his
apparently
unimpressionable
*NL*
bosom
--
though
you
never
can
tell
what
may
go
on
behind
even
a
not
quite
*NL*
spotless
plastron
!
--
And
every
week
Edward
Ashburnham
would
give
him
a
*NL*
solid
,
sound
,
golden
English
sovereign
.
Yet
this
stout
fellow
was
intent
*NL*
on
saving
that
table
for
the
Guggenheimers
of
Chicago
.
It
ended
in
*NL*
Florence
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
we
all
eat
out
of
the
same
trough
?
--
that
's
a
nasty
New
*NL*
York
saying
.
But
I
'm
sure
we
're
all
nice
quiet
people
and
there
can
be
*NL*
four
seats
at
our
table
.
It
's
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
,
as
it
were
,
an
appreciative
gurgle
from
the
Captain
and
I
*NL*
was
perfectly
aware
of
a
slight
hesitation
--
a
quick
sharp
motion
in
Mrs
*NL*
Ashburnham
,
as
if
her
horse
had
checked
.
But
she
put
it
at
the
fence
all
*NL*
right
,
rising
from
the
seat
she
had
taken
and
sitting
down
opposite
me
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
all
in
one
motion
.
I
never
thought
that
Leonora
looked
her
*NL*
best
in
evening
dress
.
She
seemed
to
get
it
too
clearly
cut
,
there
*NL*
was
no
ruffling
.
She
always
affected
black
and
her
shoulders
were
too
*NL*
classical
.
She
seemed
to
stand
out
of
her
corsage
as
a
white
marble
bust
*NL*
might
out
of
a
black
Wedgwood
vase
.
I
do
n't
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
loved
Leonora
always
and
,
today
,
I
would
very
cheerfully
lay
down
my
*NL*
life
,
what
is
left
of
it
,
in
her
service
.
But
I
am
sure
I
never
had
the
*NL*
beginnings
of
a
trace
of
what
is
called
the
sex
instinct
towards
her
.
*NL*
And
I
suppose
--
no
I
am
certain
that
she
never
had
it
towards
me
.
As
far
*NL*
as
I
am
concerned
I
think
it
was
those
white
shoulders
that
did
it
.
I
*NL*
seemed
to
feel
when
I
looked
at
them
that
,
if
ever
I
should
press
my
*NL*
lips
upon
them
that
they
would
be
slightly
cold
--
not
icily
,
not
without
*NL*
a
touch
of
human
heat
,
but
,
as
they
say
of
baths
,
with
the
chill
off
.
I
*NL*
seemed
to
feel
chilled
at
the
end
of
my
lips
when
I
looked
at
her
...
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
Leonora
always
appeared
to
me
at
her
best
in
a
blue
tailor-made
.
*NL*
Then
her
glorious
hair
was
n't
deadened
by
her
white
shoulders
.
Certain
*NL*
women
's
lines
guide
your
eyes
to
their
necks
,
their
eyelashes
,
their
*NL*
lips
,
their
breasts
.
But
Leonora
's
seemed
to
conduct
your
gaze
always
to
*NL*
her
wrist
.
And
the
wrist
was
at
its
best
in
a
black
or
a
dog-skin
glove
*NL*
and
there
was
always
a
gold
circlet
with
a
little
chain
supporting
a
*NL*
very
small
golden
key
to
a
dispatch
box
.
Perhaps
it
was
that
in
which
*NL*
she
locked
up
her
heart
and
her
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anyhow
,
she
sat
down
opposite
me
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
paid
*NL*
any
attention
to
my
existence
.
She
gave
me
,
suddenly
,
yet
deliberately
,
*NL*
one
long
stare
.
Her
eyes
too
were
blue
and
dark
and
the
eyelids
were
so
*NL*
arched
that
they
gave
you
the
whole
round
of
the
irises
.
And
it
was
a
*NL*
most
remarkable
,
a
most
moving
glance
,
as
if
for
a
moment
a
lighthouse
*NL*
had
looked
at
me
.
I
seemed
to
perceive
the
swift
questions
chasing
each
*NL*
other
through
the
brain
that
was
behind
them
.
I
seemed
to
hear
the
brain
*NL*
ask
and
the
eyes
answer
with
all
the
simpleness
of
a
woman
who
was
a
*NL*
good
hand
at
taking
in
qualities
of
a
horse
--
as
indeed
she
was
.
``
Stands
*NL*
well
;
has
plenty
of
room
for
his
oats
behind
the
girth
.
Not
so
much
in
*NL*
the
way
of
shoulders
,
''
and
so
on
.
And
so
her
eyes
asked
:
``
Is
this
man
*NL*
trustworthy
in
money
matters
;
is
he
likely
to
try
to
play
the
lover
;
is
*NL*
he
likely
to
let
his
women
be
troublesome
?
Is
he
,
above
all
,
likely
to
*NL*
babble
about
my
affairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
suddenly
,
into
those
cold
,
slightly
defiant
,
almost
defensive
china
*NL*
blue
orbs
,
there
came
a
warmth
,
a
tenderness
,
a
friendly
recognition
...
*NL*
oh
,
it
was
very
charming
and
very
touching
--
and
quite
mortifying
.
It
was
*NL*
the
look
of
a
mother
to
her
son
,
of
a
sister
to
her
brother
.
It
implied
*NL*
trust
;
it
implied
the
want
of
any
necessity
for
barriers
.
By
God
,
she
*NL*
looked
at
me
as
if
I
were
an
invalid
--
as
any
kind
woman
may
look
at
a
*NL*
poor
chap
in
a
bath
chair
.
And
,
yes
,
from
that
day
forward
she
always
*NL*
treated
me
and
not
Florence
as
if
I
were
the
invalid
.
Why
,
she
would
*NL*
run
after
me
with
a
rug
upon
chilly
days
.
I
suppose
,
therefore
,
that
her
*NL*
eyes
had
made
a
favourable
answer
.
Or
,
perhaps
,
it
was
n't
a
favourable
*NL*
answer
.
And
then
Florence
said
:
``
And
so
the
whole
round
table
is
begun
.
''
*NL*
Again
Edward
Ashburnham
gurgled
slightly
in
his
throat
;
but
Leonora
*NL*
shivered
a
little
,
as
if
a
goose
had
walked
over
her
grave
.
And
I
was
*NL*
passing
her
the
nickel-silver
basket
of
rolls
.
Avanti
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
So
began
those
nine
years
of
uninterrupted
tranquillity
.
They
were
*NL*
characterized
by
an
extraordinary
want
of
any
communicativeness
on
the
*NL*
part
of
the
Ashburnhams
to
which
we
,
on
our
part
,
replied
by
leaving
out
*NL*
quite
as
extraordinarily
,
and
nearly
as
completely
,
the
personal
note
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
you
may
take
it
that
what
characterized
our
relationship
was
an
*NL*
atmosphere
of
taking
everything
for
granted
.
The
given
proposition
was
,
*NL*
that
we
were
all
``
good
people
.
''
We
took
for
granted
that
we
all
liked
*NL*
beef
underdone
but
not
too
underdone
;
that
both
men
preferred
a
good
*NL*
liqueur
brandy
after
lunch
;
that
both
women
drank
a
very
light
Rhine
*NL*
wine
qualified
with
Fachingen
water
--
that
sort
of
thing
.
It
was
also
*NL*
taken
for
granted
that
we
were
both
sufficiently
well
off
to
afford
*NL*
anything
that
we
could
reasonably
want
in
the
way
of
amusements
fitting
*NL*
to
our
station
--
that
we
could
take
motor
cars
and
carriages
by
the
day
;
*NL*
that
we
could
give
each
other
dinners
and
dine
our
friends
and
we
could
*NL*
indulge
if
we
liked
in
economy
.
Thus
,
Florence
was
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
having
the
Daily
Telegraph
sent
to
her
every
day
from
London
.
She
was
*NL*
always
an
Anglo-maniac
,
was
Florence
;
the
Paris
edition
of
the
New
York
*NL*
Herald
was
always
good
enough
for
me
.
But
when
we
discovered
that
*NL*
the
Ashburnhams
'
copy
of
the
London
paper
followed
them
from
England
,
*NL*
Leonora
and
Florence
decided
between
them
to
suppress
one
subscription
*NL*
one
year
and
the
other
the
next
.
Similarly
it
was
the
habit
of
the
Grand
*NL*
Duke
of
Nassau
Schwerin
,
who
came
yearly
to
the
baths
,
to
dine
once
with
*NL*
about
eighteen
families
of
regular
Kur
guests
.
In
return
he
would
give
a
*NL*
dinner
of
all
the
eighteen
at
once
.
And
,
since
these
dinners
were
rather
*NL*
expensive
-LRB-
you
had
to
take
the
Grand
Duke
and
a
good
many
of
his
suite
*NL*
and
any
members
of
the
diplomatic
bodies
that
might
be
there
-RRB-
--
Florence
*NL*
and
Leonora
,
putting
their
heads
together
,
did
n't
see
why
we
should
n't
*NL*
give
the
Grand
Duke
his
dinner
together
.
And
so
we
did
.
I
do
n't
suppose
*NL*
the
Serenity
minded
that
economy
,
or
even
noticed
it
.
At
any
rate
,
our
*NL*
joint
dinner
to
the
Royal
Personage
gradually
assumed
the
aspect
of
a
*NL*
yearly
function
.
Indeed
,
it
grew
larger
and
larger
,
until
it
became
a
*NL*
sort
of
closing
function
for
the
season
,
at
any
rate
as
far
as
we
were
*NL*
concerned
.
I
do
n't
in
the
least
mean
to
say
that
we
were
the
sort
of
*NL*
persons
who
aspired
to
mix
``
with
royalty
.
''
We
did
n't
;
we
had
n't
any
*NL*
claims
;
we
were
just
``
good
people
.
''
But
the
Grand
Duke
was
a
pleasant
,
*NL*
affable
sort
of
royalty
,
like
the
late
King
Edward
VII
,
and
it
was
*NL*
pleasant
to
hear
him
talk
about
the
races
and
,
very
occasionally
,
as
a
*NL*
bonne
bouche
,
about
his
nephew
,
the
Emperor
;
or
to
have
him
pause
for
*NL*
a
moment
in
his
walk
to
ask
after
the
progress
of
our
cures
or
to
be
*NL*
benignantly
interested
in
the
amount
of
money
we
had
put
on
Leloeffel
's
*NL*
hunter
for
the
Frankfurt
Welter
Stakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
know
how
we
put
in
our
time
.
How
does
one
put
*NL*
in
one
's
time
?
How
is
it
possible
to
have
achieved
nine
years
and
to
*NL*
have
nothing
whatever
to
show
for
it
?
Nothing
whatever
,
you
understand
.
*NL*
Not
so
much
as
a
bone
penholder
,
carved
to
resemble
a
chessman
and
with
*NL*
a
hole
in
the
top
through
which
you
could
see
four
views
of
Nauheim
.
*NL*
And
,
as
for
experience
,
as
for
knowledge
of
one
's
fellow
beings
--
nothing
*NL*
either
.
Upon
my
word
,
I
could
n't
tell
you
offhand
whether
the
lady
who
*NL*
sold
the
so
expensive
violets
at
the
bottom
of
the
road
that
leads
to
*NL*
the
station
,
was
cheating
me
or
no
;
I
ca
n't
say
whether
the
porter
who
*NL*
carried
our
traps
across
the
station
at
Leghorn
was
a
thief
or
no
when
*NL*
he
said
that
the
regular
tariff
was
a
lira
a
parcel
.
The
instances
of
*NL*
honesty
that
one
comes
across
in
this
world
are
just
as
amazing
as
the
*NL*
instances
of
dishonesty
.
After
forty-five
years
of
mixing
with
one
's
*NL*
kind
,
one
ought
to
have
acquired
the
habit
of
being
able
to
know
*NL*
something
about
one
's
fellow
beings
.
But
one
does
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
the
modern
civilized
habit
--
the
modern
English
habit
of
taking
*NL*
every
one
for
granted
--
is
a
good
deal
to
blame
for
this
.
I
have
observed
*NL*
this
matter
long
enough
to
know
the
queer
,
subtle
thing
that
it
is
;
to
*NL*
know
how
the
faculty
,
for
what
it
is
worth
,
never
lets
you
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mind
,
I
am
not
saying
that
this
is
not
the
most
desirable
type
of
life
*NL*
in
the
world
;
that
it
is
not
an
almost
unreasonably
high
standard
.
For
*NL*
it
is
really
nauseating
,
when
you
detest
it
,
to
have
to
eat
every
day
*NL*
several
slices
of
thin
,
tepid
,
pink
india
rubber
,
and
it
is
disagreeable
*NL*
to
have
to
drink
brandy
when
you
would
prefer
to
be
cheered
up
by
warm
,
*NL*
sweet
Kuemmel
.
And
it
is
nasty
to
have
to
take
a
cold
bath
in
the
morning
*NL*
when
what
you
want
is
really
a
hot
one
at
night
.
And
it
stirs
a
little
*NL*
of
the
faith
of
your
fathers
that
is
deep
down
within
you
to
have
to
*NL*
have
it
taken
for
granted
that
you
are
an
Episcopalian
when
really
you
*NL*
are
an
old-fashioned
Philadelphia
Quaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
things
have
to
be
done
;
it
is
the
cock
that
the
whole
of
this
*NL*
society
owes
to
AEsculapius
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
odd
,
queer
thing
is
that
the
whole
collection
of
rules
applies
*NL*
to
anybody
--
to
the
anybodies
that
you
meet
in
hotels
,
in
railway
trains
,
*NL*
to
a
less
degree
,
perhaps
,
in
steamers
,
but
even
,
in
the
end
,
upon
*NL*
steamers
.
You
meet
a
man
or
a
woman
and
,
from
tiny
and
intimate
sounds
,
*NL*
from
the
slightest
of
movements
,
you
know
at
once
whether
you
are
*NL*
concerned
with
good
people
or
with
those
who
wo
n't
do
.
You
know
,
this
*NL*
is
to
say
,
whether
they
will
go
rigidly
through
with
the
whole
programme
*NL*
from
the
underdone
beef
to
the
Anglicanism
.
It
wo
n't
matter
whether
they
*NL*
be
short
or
tall
;
whether
the
voice
squeak
like
a
marionette
or
rumble
*NL*
like
a
town
bull
's
;
it
wo
n't
matter
whether
they
are
Germans
,
Austrians
,
*NL*
French
,
Spanish
,
or
even
Brazilians
--
they
will
be
the
Germans
or
*NL*
Brazilians
who
take
a
cold
bath
every
morning
and
who
move
,
roughly
*NL*
speaking
,
in
diplomatic
circles
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
inconvenient
--
well
,
hang
it
all
,
I
will
say
it
--
the
damnable
*NL*
nuisance
of
the
whole
thing
is
,
that
with
all
the
taking
for
granted
,
*NL*
you
never
really
get
an
inch
deeper
than
the
things
I
have
catalogued
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
give
you
a
rather
extraordinary
instance
of
this
.
I
ca
n't
remember
*NL*
whether
it
was
in
our
first
year
--
the
first
year
of
us
four
at
Nauheim
,
*NL*
because
,
of
course
,
it
would
have
been
the
fourth
year
of
Florence
and
*NL*
myself
--
but
it
must
have
been
in
the
first
or
second
year
.
And
that
*NL*
gives
the
measure
at
once
of
the
extraordinariness
of
our
discussion
and
*NL*
of
the
swiftness
with
which
intimacy
had
grown
up
between
us
.
On
the
one
*NL*
hand
we
seemed
to
start
out
on
the
expedition
so
naturally
and
with
*NL*
so
little
preparation
,
that
it
was
as
if
we
must
have
made
many
such
*NL*
excursions
before
;
and
our
intimacy
seemed
so
deep
...
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
place
to
which
we
went
was
obviously
one
to
which
Florence
at
*NL*
least
would
have
wanted
to
take
us
quite
early
,
so
that
you
would
*NL*
almost
think
we
should
have
gone
there
together
at
the
beginning
of
our
*NL*
intimacy
.
Florence
was
singularly
expert
as
a
guide
to
archaeological
*NL*
expeditions
and
there
was
nothing
she
liked
so
much
as
taking
people
*NL*
round
ruins
and
showing
you
the
window
from
which
some
one
looked
down
*NL*
upon
the
murder
of
some
one
else
.
She
only
did
it
once
;
but
she
did
*NL*
it
quite
magnificently
.
She
could
find
her
way
,
with
the
sole
help
*NL*
of
Baedeker
,
as
easily
about
any
old
monument
as
she
could
about
any
*NL*
American
city
where
the
blocks
are
all
square
and
the
streets
all
*NL*
numbered
,
so
that
you
can
go
perfectly
easily
from
Twenty-fourth
to
*NL*
Thirtieth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
happens
that
fifty
minutes
away
from
Nauheim
,
by
a
good
train
,
is
*NL*
the
ancient
city
of
M
--
,
upon
a
great
pinnacle
of
basalt
,
girt
with
*NL*
a
triple
road
running
sideways
up
its
shoulder
like
a
scarf
.
And
at
the
*NL*
top
there
is
a
castle
--
not
a
square
castle
like
Windsor
,
but
a
castle
*NL*
all
slate
gables
and
high
peaks
with
gilt
weathercocks
flashing
*NL*
bravely
--
the
castle
of
St
Elizabeth
of
Hungary
.
It
has
the
disadvantage
*NL*
of
being
in
Prussia
;
and
it
is
always
disagreeable
to
go
into
that
*NL*
country
;
but
it
is
very
old
and
there
are
many
double-spired
churches
*NL*
and
it
stands
up
like
a
pyramid
out
of
the
green
valley
of
the
Lahn
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
suppose
the
Ashburnhams
wanted
especially
to
go
there
and
I
did
n't
*NL*
especially
want
to
go
there
myself
.
But
,
you
understand
,
there
was
no
*NL*
objection
.
It
was
part
of
the
cure
to
make
an
excursion
three
or
four
*NL*
times
a
week
.
So
that
we
were
all
quite
unanimous
in
being
grateful
*NL*
to
Florence
for
providing
the
motive
power
.
Florence
,
of
course
,
had
*NL*
a
motive
of
her
own
.
She
was
at
that
time
engaged
in
educating
Captain
*NL*
Ashburnham
--
oh
,
of
course
,
quite
pour
le
bon
motif
!
She
used
to
say
to
*NL*
Leonora
:
``
I
simply
ca
n't
understand
how
you
can
let
him
live
by
your
*NL*
side
and
be
so
ignorant
!
''
Leonora
herself
always
struck
me
as
being
*NL*
remarkably
well
educated
.
At
any
rate
,
she
knew
beforehand
all
that
*NL*
Florence
had
to
tell
her
.
Perhaps
she
got
it
up
out
of
Baedeker
before
*NL*
Florence
was
up
in
the
morning
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
you
would
ever
*NL*
have
known
that
Leonora
knew
anything
,
but
if
Florence
started
to
tell
*NL*
us
how
Ludwig
the
Courageous
wanted
to
have
three
wives
at
once
--
in
*NL*
which
he
differed
from
Henry
VIII
,
who
wanted
them
one
after
the
other
,
*NL*
and
this
caused
a
good
deal
of
trouble
--
if
Florence
started
to
tell
us
*NL*
this
,
Leonora
would
just
nod
her
head
in
a
way
that
quite
pleasantly
*NL*
rattled
my
poor
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
used
to
exclaim
:
``
Well
,
if
you
knew
it
,
why
have
n't
you
told
it
all
*NL*
already
to
Captain
Ashburnham
?
I
'm
sure
he
finds
it
interesting
!
''
And
*NL*
Leonora
would
look
reflectively
at
her
husband
and
say
:
``
I
have
an
idea
*NL*
that
it
might
injure
his
hand
--
the
hand
,
you
know
,
used
in
connection
*NL*
with
horses
'
mouths
...
''
And
poor
Ashburnham
would
blush
and
mutter
and
*NL*
would
say
:
``
That
's
all
right
.
Do
n't
you
bother
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
fancy
his
wife
's
irony
did
quite
alarm
poor
Teddy
;
because
one
evening
*NL*
he
asked
me
seriously
in
the
smoking-room
if
I
thought
that
having
too
*NL*
much
in
one
's
head
would
really
interfere
with
one
's
quickness
in
polo
.
*NL*
It
struck
him
,
he
said
,
that
brainy
Johnnies
generally
were
rather
muffs
*NL*
when
they
got
on
to
four
legs
.
I
reassured
him
as
best
I
could
.
I
told
*NL*
him
that
he
was
n't
likely
to
take
in
enough
to
upset
his
balance
.
At
*NL*
that
time
the
Captain
was
quite
evidently
enjoying
being
educated
by
*NL*
Florence
.
She
used
to
do
it
about
three
or
four
times
a
week
under
*NL*
the
approving
eyes
of
Leonora
and
myself
.
It
was
n't
,
you
understand
,
*NL*
systematic
.
It
came
in
bursts
.
It
was
Florence
clearing
up
one
of
the
*NL*
dark
places
of
the
earth
,
leaving
the
world
a
little
lighter
than
she
*NL*
had
found
it
.
She
would
tell
him
the
story
of
Hamlet
;
explain
the
form
*NL*
of
a
symphony
,
humming
the
first
and
second
subjects
to
him
,
and
so
on
;
*NL*
she
would
explain
to
him
the
difference
between
Arminians
and
Erastians
;
*NL*
or
she
would
give
him
a
short
lecture
on
the
early
history
of
the
United
*NL*
States
.
And
it
was
done
in
a
way
well
calculated
to
arrest
a
young
*NL*
attention
.
Did
you
ever
read
Mrs
Markham
?
Well
,
it
was
like
that
...
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
our
excursion
to
M
--
was
a
much
larger
,
a
much
more
full
dress
*NL*
affair
.
You
see
,
in
the
archives
of
the
Schloss
in
that
city
there
was
*NL*
a
document
which
Florence
thought
would
finally
give
her
the
chance
to
*NL*
educate
the
whole
lot
of
us
together
.
It
really
worried
poor
Florence
*NL*
that
she
could
n't
,
in
matters
of
culture
,
ever
get
the
better
of
*NL*
Leonora
.
I
do
n't
know
what
Leonora
knew
or
what
she
did
n't
know
,
*NL*
but
certainly
she
was
always
there
whenever
Florence
brought
out
any
*NL*
information
.
And
she
gave
,
somehow
,
the
impression
of
really
knowing
*NL*
what
poor
Florence
gave
the
impression
of
having
only
picked
up
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
exactly
define
it
.
It
was
almost
something
physical
.
Have
you
ever
seen
*NL*
a
retriever
dashing
in
play
after
a
greyhound
?
You
see
the
two
running
*NL*
over
a
green
field
,
almost
side
by
side
,
and
suddenly
the
retriever
*NL*
makes
a
friendly
snap
at
the
other
.
And
the
greyhound
simply
is
n't
*NL*
there
.
You
have
n't
observed
it
quicken
its
speed
or
strain
a
limb
;
but
*NL*
there
it
is
,
just
two
yards
in
front
of
the
retriever
's
outstretched
*NL*
muzzle
.
So
it
was
with
Florence
and
Leonora
in
matters
of
culture
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
this
occasion
I
knew
that
something
was
up
.
I
found
Florence
some
*NL*
days
before
,
reading
books
like
Ranke
's
History
of
the
Popes
,
Symonds
'
*NL*
Renaissance
,
Motley
's
Rise
of
the
Dutch
Republic
and
Luther
's
Table
*NL*
Talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
say
that
,
until
the
astonishment
came
,
I
got
nothing
but
pleasure
*NL*
out
of
the
little
expedition
.
I
like
catching
the
two-forty
;
I
like
the
*NL*
slow
,
smooth
roll
of
the
great
big
trains
--
and
they
are
the
best
trains
*NL*
in
the
world
!
I
like
being
drawn
through
the
green
country
and
looking
*NL*
at
it
through
the
clear
glass
of
the
great
windows
.
Though
,
of
course
,
*NL*
the
country
is
n't
really
green
.
The
sun
shines
,
the
earth
is
blood
red
*NL*
and
purple
and
red
and
green
and
red
.
And
the
oxen
in
the
ploughlands
*NL*
are
bright
varnished
brown
and
black
and
blackish
purple
;
and
the
*NL*
peasants
are
dressed
in
the
black
and
white
of
magpies
;
and
there
are
*NL*
great
Rocks
of
magpies
too
.
Or
the
peasants
'
dresses
in
another
field
*NL*
where
there
are
little
mounds
of
hay
that
will
be
grey-green
on
*NL*
the
sunny
side
and
purple
in
the
shadows
--
the
peasants
'
dresses
are
*NL*
vermilion
with
emerald
green
ribbons
and
purple
skirts
and
white
shirts
*NL*
and
black
velvet
stomachers
.
Still
,
the
impression
is
that
you
are
drawn
*NL*
through
brilliant
green
meadows
that
run
away
on
each
side
to
the
dark
*NL*
purple
fir-woods
;
the
basalt
pinnacles
;
the
immense
forests
.
And
there
*NL*
is
meadowsweet
at
the
edge
of
the
streams
,
and
cattle
.
Why
,
I
remember
*NL*
on
that
afternoon
I
saw
a
brown
cow
hitch
its
horns
under
the
stomach
*NL*
of
a
black
and
white
animal
and
the
black
and
white
one
was
thrown
right
*NL*
into
the
middle
of
a
narrow
stream
.
I
burst
out
laughing
.
But
Florence
*NL*
was
imparting
information
so
hard
and
Leonora
was
listening
so
intently
*NL*
that
no
one
noticed
me
.
As
for
me
,
I
was
pleased
to
be
off
duty
;
I
was
*NL*
pleased
to
think
that
Florence
for
the
moment
was
indubitably
out
of
*NL*
mischief
--
because
she
was
talking
about
Ludwig
the
Courageous
-LRB-
I
think
*NL*
it
was
Ludwig
the
Courageous
but
I
am
not
an
historian
-RRB-
about
Ludwig
*NL*
the
Courageous
of
Hessen
who
wanted
to
have
three
wives
at
once
and
*NL*
patronized
Luther
--
something
like
that
!
--
I
was
so
relieved
to
be
off
*NL*
duty
,
because
she
could
n't
possibly
be
doing
anything
to
excite
herself
*NL*
or
set
her
poor
heart
a-fluttering
--
that
the
incident
of
the
cow
was
a
*NL*
real
joy
to
me
.
I
chuckled
over
it
from
time
to
time
for
the
whole
rest
*NL*
of
the
day
.
Because
it
does
look
very
funny
,
you
know
,
to
see
a
black
*NL*
and
white
cow
land
on
its
back
in
the
middle
of
a
stream
.
It
is
so
just
*NL*
exactly
what
one
does
n't
expect
of
a
cow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
I
ought
to
have
pitied
the
poor
animal
;
but
I
just
did
n't
.
I
*NL*
was
out
for
enjoyment
.
And
I
just
enjoyed
myself
.
It
is
so
pleasant
to
*NL*
be
drawn
along
in
front
of
the
spectacular
towns
with
the
peaked
*NL*
castles
and
the
many
double
spires
.
In
the
sunlight
gleams
come
from
*NL*
the
city
--
gleams
from
the
glass
of
windows
;
from
the
gilt
signs
of
*NL*
apothecaries
;
from
the
ensigns
of
the
student
corps
high
up
in
the
*NL*
mountains
;
from
the
helmets
of
the
funny
little
soldiers
moving
their
*NL*
stiff
little
legs
in
white
linen
trousers
.
And
it
was
pleasant
to
get
*NL*
out
in
the
great
big
spectacular
Prussian
station
with
the
hammered
*NL*
bronze
ornaments
and
the
paintings
of
peasants
and
flowers
and
cows
;
*NL*
and
to
hear
Florence
bargain
energetically
with
the
driver
of
an
ancient
*NL*
droschka
drawn
by
two
lean
horses
.
Of
course
,
I
spoke
German
much
more
*NL*
correctly
than
Florence
,
though
I
never
could
rid
myself
quite
of
the
*NL*
accent
of
the
Pennsylvania
Duitsch
of
my
childhood
.
Anyhow
,
we
were
*NL*
drawn
in
a
sort
of
triumph
,
for
five
marks
without
any
trinkgeld
,
right
*NL*
up
to
the
castle
.
And
we
were
taken
through
the
museum
and
saw
the
*NL*
fire-backs
,
the
old
glass
,
the
old
swords
and
the
antique
contraptions
.
*NL*
And
we
went
up
winding
corkscrew
staircases
and
through
the
Rittersaal
,
*NL*
the
great
painted
hall
where
the
Reformer
and
his
friends
met
for
the
*NL*
first
time
under
the
protection
of
the
gentleman
that
had
three
wives
at
*NL*
once
and
formed
an
alliance
with
the
gentleman
that
had
six
wives
,
one
*NL*
after
the
other
-LRB-
I
'm
not
really
interested
in
these
facts
but
they
have
*NL*
a
bearing
on
my
story
-RRB-
.
And
we
went
through
chapels
,
and
music
rooms
,
*NL*
right
up
immensely
high
in
the
air
to
a
large
old
chamber
,
full
of
*NL*
presses
,
with
heavily-shuttered
windows
all
round
.
And
Florence
became
*NL*
positively
electric
.
She
told
the
tired
,
bored
custodian
what
shutters
*NL*
to
open
;
so
that
the
bright
sunlight
streamed
in
palpable
shafts
into
*NL*
the
dim
old
chamber
.
She
explained
that
this
was
Luther
's
bedroom
and
*NL*
that
just
where
the
sunlight
fell
had
stood
his
bed
.
As
a
matter
of
*NL*
fact
,
I
believe
that
she
was
wrong
and
that
Luther
only
stopped
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
for
lunch
,
in
order
to
evade
pursuit
.
But
,
no
doubt
,
it
would
have
*NL*
been
his
bedroom
if
he
could
have
been
persuaded
to
stop
the
night
.
And
*NL*
then
,
in
spite
of
the
protest
of
the
custodian
,
she
threw
open
another
*NL*
shutter
and
came
tripping
back
to
a
large
glass
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
,
''
she
exclaimed
with
an
accent
of
gaiety
,
of
triumph
,
and
of
*NL*
audacity
.
She
was
pointing
at
a
piece
of
paper
,
like
the
half-sheet
of
a
*NL*
letter
with
some
faint
pencil
scrawls
that
might
have
been
a
jotting
of
*NL*
the
amounts
we
were
spending
during
the
day
.
And
I
was
extremely
happy
*NL*
at
her
gaiety
,
in
her
triumph
,
in
her
audacity
.
Captain
Ashburnham
had
*NL*
his
hands
upon
the
glass
case
.
``
There
it
is
--
the
Protest
.
''
And
then
,
as
*NL*
we
all
properly
stage-managed
our
bewilderment
,
she
continued
:
``
Do
n't
*NL*
you
know
that
is
why
we
were
all
called
Protestants
?
That
is
the
pencil
*NL*
draft
of
the
Protest
they
drew
up
.
You
can
see
the
signatures
of
Martin
*NL*
Luther
,
and
Martin
Bucer
,
and
Zwingli
,
and
Ludwig
the
Courageous
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
may
have
got
some
of
the
names
wrong
,
but
I
know
that
Luther
and
Bucer
*NL*
were
there
.
And
her
animation
continued
and
I
was
glad
.
She
was
better
*NL*
and
she
was
out
of
mischief
.
She
continued
,
looking
up
into
Captain
*NL*
Ashburnham
's
eyes
:
``
It
's
because
of
that
piece
of
paper
that
you
're
*NL*
honest
,
sober
,
industrious
,
provident
,
and
clean-lived
.
If
it
were
n't
*NL*
for
that
piece
of
paper
you
'd
be
like
the
Irish
or
the
Italians
or
the
*NL*
Poles
,
but
particularly
the
Irish
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
laid
one
finger
upon
Captain
Ashburnham
's
wrist
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
aware
of
something
treacherous
,
something
frightful
,
something
*NL*
evil
in
the
day
.
I
ca
n't
define
it
and
ca
n't
find
a
simile
for
it
.
It
*NL*
was
n't
as
if
a
snake
had
looked
out
of
a
hole
.
No
,
it
was
as
if
my
heart
*NL*
had
missed
a
beat
.
It
was
as
if
we
were
going
to
run
and
cry
out
;
all
*NL*
four
of
us
in
separate
directions
,
averting
our
heads
.
In
Ashburnham
's
*NL*
face
I
know
that
there
was
absolute
panic
.
I
was
horribly
frightened
and
*NL*
then
I
discovered
that
the
pain
in
my
left
wrist
was
caused
by
Leonora
's
*NL*
clutching
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stand
this
,
''
she
said
with
a
most
extraordinary
passion
;
``
I
*NL*
must
get
out
of
this
.
''
I
was
horribly
frightened
.
It
came
to
me
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
though
I
had
n't
time
to
think
it
,
that
she
must
be
a
madly
*NL*
jealous
woman
--
jealous
of
Florence
and
Captain
Ashburnham
,
of
all
people
*NL*
in
the
world
!
And
it
was
a
panic
in
which
we
fled
!
We
went
right
down
*NL*
the
winding
stairs
,
across
the
immense
Rittersaal
to
a
little
terrace
*NL*
that
overlooks
the
Lahn
,
the
broad
valley
and
the
immense
plain
into
*NL*
which
it
opens
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
?
''
she
said
,
``
do
n't
you
see
what
's
going
on
?
''
The
panic
*NL*
again
stopped
my
heart
.
I
muttered
,
I
stuttered
--
I
do
n't
know
how
I
got
*NL*
the
words
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
What
's
the
matter
?
Whatever
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
me
straight
in
the
eyes
;
and
for
a
moment
I
had
the
feeling
*NL*
that
those
two
blue
discs
were
immense
,
were
overwhelming
,
were
like
*NL*
a
wall
of
blue
that
shut
me
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
.
I
know
it
*NL*
sounds
absurd
;
but
that
is
what
it
did
feel
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
really
horrible
bitterness
,
with
a
*NL*
really
horrible
lamentation
in
her
voice
,
``
Do
n't
you
see
that
that
's
the
*NL*
cause
of
the
whole
miserable
affair
;
of
the
whole
sorrow
of
the
world
?
*NL*
And
of
the
eternal
damnation
of
you
and
me
and
them
...
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
remember
how
she
went
on
;
I
was
too
frightened
;
I
was
too
*NL*
amazed
.
I
think
I
was
thinking
of
running
to
fetch
assistance
--
a
doctor
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
or
Captain
Ashburnham
.
Or
possibly
she
needed
Florence
's
tender
*NL*
care
,
though
,
of
course
,
it
would
have
been
very
bad
for
Florence
's
*NL*
heart
.
But
I
know
that
when
I
came
out
of
it
she
was
saying
:
``
Oh
,
*NL*
where
are
all
the
bright
,
happy
,
innocent
beings
in
the
world
?
Where
's
*NL*
happiness
?
One
reads
of
it
in
books
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
her
hand
with
a
singular
clawing
motion
upwards
over
her
*NL*
forehead
.
Her
eyes
were
enormously
distended
;
her
face
was
exactly
that
*NL*
of
a
person
looking
into
the
pit
of
hell
and
seeing
horrors
there
.
And
*NL*
then
suddenly
she
stopped
.
She
was
,
most
amazingly
,
just
Mrs
Ashburnham
*NL*
again
.
Her
face
was
perfectly
clear
,
sharp
and
defined
;
her
hair
was
*NL*
glorious
in
its
golden
coils
.
Her
nostrils
twitched
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
contempt
.
She
appeared
to
look
with
interest
at
a
gypsy
caravan
that
was
*NL*
coming
over
a
little
bridge
far
below
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
,
''
she
said
,
in
her
clear
hard
voice
,
``
do
n't
you
know
*NL*
that
I
'm
an
Irish
Catholic
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
THOSE
words
gave
me
the
greatest
relief
that
I
have
ever
had
in
my
*NL*
life
.
They
told
me
,
I
think
,
almost
more
than
I
have
ever
gathered
at
*NL*
any
one
moment
--
about
myself
.
I
do
n't
think
that
before
that
day
I
had
*NL*
ever
wanted
anything
very
much
except
Florence
.
I
have
,
of
course
,
had
*NL*
appetites
,
impatiences
...
Why
,
sometimes
at
a
table
d'hote
,
when
there
*NL*
would
be
,
say
,
caviare
handed
round
,
I
have
been
absolutely
full
of
*NL*
impatience
for
fear
that
when
the
dish
came
to
me
there
should
not
be
*NL*
a
satisfying
portion
left
over
by
the
other
guests
.
I
have
been
*NL*
exceedingly
impatient
at
missing
trains
.
The
Belgian
State
Railway
has
*NL*
a
trick
of
letting
the
French
trains
miss
their
connections
at
Brussels
.
*NL*
That
has
always
infuriated
me
.
I
have
written
about
it
letters
to
The
*NL*
Times
that
The
Times
never
printed
;
those
that
I
wrote
to
the
Paris
*NL*
edition
of
the
New
York
Herald
were
always
printed
,
but
they
never
*NL*
seemed
to
satisfy
me
when
I
saw
them
.
Well
,
that
was
a
sort
of
frenzy
*NL*
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
frenzy
that
now
I
can
hardly
realize
.
I
can
understand
it
*NL*
intellectually
.
You
see
,
in
those
days
I
was
interested
in
people
with
*NL*
``
hearts
.
''
There
was
Florence
,
there
was
Edward
Ashburnham
--
or
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
it
was
Leonora
that
I
was
more
interested
in
.
I
do
n't
mean
in
the
way
of
*NL*
love
.
But
,
you
see
,
we
were
both
of
the
same
profession
--
at
any
rate
as
*NL*
I
saw
it
.
And
the
profession
was
that
of
keeping
heart
patients
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
have
no
idea
how
engrossing
such
a
profession
may
become
.
Just
as
*NL*
the
blacksmith
says
:
``
By
hammer
and
hand
all
Art
doth
stand
,
''
just
as
*NL*
the
baker
thinks
that
all
the
solar
system
revolves
around
his
morning
*NL*
delivery
of
rolls
,
as
the
postmaster-general
believes
that
he
alone
*NL*
is
the
preserver
of
society
--
and
surely
,
surely
,
these
delusions
are
*NL*
necessary
to
keep
us
going
--
so
did
I
and
,
as
I
believed
,
Leonora
,
*NL*
imagine
that
the
whole
world
ought
to
be
arranged
so
as
to
ensure
the
*NL*
keeping
alive
of
heart
patients
.
You
have
no
idea
how
engrossing
such
a
*NL*
profession
may
become
--
how
imbecile
,
in
view
of
that
engrossment
,
appear
*NL*
the
ways
of
princes
,
of
republics
,
of
municipalities
.
A
rough
bit
of
*NL*
road
beneath
the
motor
tyres
,
a
couple
of
succeeding
``
thank
`
ee-marms
''
*NL*
with
their
quick
jolts
would
be
enough
to
set
me
grumbling
to
Leonora
*NL*
against
the
Prince
or
the
Grand
Duke
or
the
Free
City
through
whose
*NL*
territory
we
might
be
passing
.
I
would
grumble
like
a
stockbroker
whose
*NL*
conversations
over
the
telephone
are
incommoded
by
the
ringing
of
bells
*NL*
from
a
city
church
.
I
would
talk
about
medieval
survivals
,
about
the
*NL*
taxes
being
surely
high
enough
.
The
point
,
by
the
way
,
about
the
missing
*NL*
of
the
connections
of
the
Calais
boat
trains
at
Brussels
was
that
the
*NL*
shortest
possible
sea
journey
is
frequently
of
great
importance
to
*NL*
sufferers
from
the
heart
.
Now
,
on
the
Continent
,
there
are
two
special
*NL*
heart
cure
places
,
Nauheim
and
Spa
,
and
to
reach
both
of
these
baths
*NL*
from
England
if
in
order
to
ensure
a
short
sea
passage
,
you
come
by
*NL*
Calais
--
you
have
to
make
the
connection
at
Brussels
.
And
the
Belgian
*NL*
train
never
waits
by
so
much
the
shade
of
a
second
for
the
one
coming
*NL*
from
Calais
or
from
Paris
.
And
even
if
the
French
train
,
are
just
on
*NL*
time
,
you
have
to
run
--
imagine
a
heart
patient
running
!
--
along
the
*NL*
unfamiliar
ways
of
the
Brussels
station
and
to
scramble
up
the
high
*NL*
steps
of
the
moving
train
.
Or
,
if
you
miss
connection
,
you
have
to
wait
*NL*
five
or
six
hours
...
I
used
to
keep
awake
whole
nights
cursing
that
*NL*
abuse
.
My
wife
used
to
run
--
she
never
,
in
whatever
else
she
may
have
*NL*
misled
me
,
tried
to
give
me
the
impression
that
she
was
not
a
gallant
*NL*
soul
.
But
,
once
in
the
German
Express
,
she
would
lean
back
,
with
one
*NL*
hand
to
her
side
and
her
eyes
closed
.
Well
,
she
was
a
good
actress
.
And
*NL*
I
would
be
in
hell
.
In
hell
,
I
tell
you
.
For
in
Florence
I
had
at
once
*NL*
a
wife
and
an
unattained
mistress
--
that
is
what
it
comes
to
--
and
in
*NL*
the
retaining
of
her
in
this
world
I
had
my
occupation
,
my
career
,
my
*NL*
ambition
.
It
is
not
often
that
these
things
are
united
in
one
body
.
*NL*
Leonora
was
a
good
actress
too
.
By
Jove
she
was
good
!
I
tell
you
,
she
*NL*
would
listen
to
me
by
the
hour
,
evolving
my
plans
for
a
shock-proof
*NL*
world
.
It
is
true
that
,
at
times
,
I
used
to
notice
about
her
an
air
*NL*
of
inattention
as
if
she
were
listening
,
a
mother
,
to
the
child
at
her
*NL*
knee
,
or
as
if
,
precisely
,
I
were
myself
the
patient
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
understand
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
Edward
*NL*
Ashburnham
's
heart
--
that
he
had
thrown
up
his
commission
and
had
left
*NL*
India
and
come
half
the
world
over
in
order
to
follow
a
woman
who
had
*NL*
really
had
a
``
heart
''
to
Nauheim
.
That
was
the
sort
of
sentimental
ass
he
*NL*
was
.
For
,
you
understand
,
too
,
that
they
really
needed
to
live
in
India
,
*NL*
to
economize
,
to
let
the
house
at
Branshaw
Teleragh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
at
that
date
,
I
had
never
heard
of
the
Kilsyte
case
.
*NL*
Ashburnham
had
,
you
know
,
kissed
a
servant
girl
in
a
railway
train
,
*NL*
and
it
was
only
the
grace
of
God
,
the
prompt
functioning
of
the
*NL*
communication
cord
and
the
ready
sympathy
of
what
I
believe
you
call
*NL*
the
Hampshire
Bench
,
that
kept
the
poor
devil
out
of
Winchester
Gaol
for
*NL*
years
and
years
.
I
never
heard
of
that
case
until
the
final
stages
of
*NL*
Leonora
's
revelations
...
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
think
of
that
poor
wretch
...
I
,
who
have
surely
the
right
,
beg
*NL*
you
to
think
of
that
poor
wretch
.
Is
it
possible
that
such
a
luckless
*NL*
devil
should
be
so
tormented
by
blind
and
inscrutable
destiny
?
For
there
*NL*
is
no
other
way
to
think
of
it
.
None
.
I
have
the
right
to
say
it
,
since
*NL*
for
years
he
was
my
wife
's
lover
,
since
he
killed
her
,
since
he
broke
*NL*
up
all
the
pleasantnesses
that
there
were
in
my
life
.
There
is
no
priest
*NL*
that
has
the
right
to
tell
me
that
I
must
not
ask
pity
for
him
,
from
*NL*
you
,
silent
listener
beyond
the
hearth-stone
,
from
the
world
,
or
from
*NL*
the
God
who
created
in
him
those
desires
,
those
madnesses
...
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
I
should
not
hear
of
the
Kilsyte
case
.
I
knew
none
of
their
*NL*
friends
;
they
were
for
me
just
good
people
--
fortunate
people
with
broad
*NL*
and
sunny
acres
in
a
southern
county
.
Just
good
people
!
By
heavens
,
I
*NL*
sometimes
think
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
,
poor
dear
,
if
*NL*
the
case
had
been
such
a
one
that
I
must
needs
have
heard
of
it
--
such
a
*NL*
one
as
maids
and
couriers
and
other
Kur
guests
whisper
about
for
years
*NL*
after
,
until
gradually
it
dies
away
in
the
pity
that
there
is
knocking
*NL*
about
here
and
there
in
the
world
.
Supposing
he
had
spent
his
seven
*NL*
years
in
Winchester
Gaol
or
whatever
it
is
that
inscrutable
and
*NL*
blind
justice
allots
to
you
for
following
your
natural
but
ill-timed
*NL*
inclinations
--
there
would
have
arrived
a
stage
when
nodding
gossips
*NL*
on
the
Kursaal
terrace
would
have
said
,
``
Poor
fellow
,
''
thinking
of
his
*NL*
ruined
career
.
He
would
have
been
the
fine
soldier
with
his
back
now
*NL*
bent
...
Better
for
him
,
poor
devil
,
if
his
back
had
been
prematurely
*NL*
bent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
it
would
have
been
a
thousand
times
better
...
For
,
of
course
,
the
*NL*
Kilsyte
case
,
which
came
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
finding
Leonora
*NL*
cold
and
unsympathetic
,
gave
him
a
nasty
jar
.
He
left
servants
alone
*NL*
after
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
turned
him
,
naturally
,
all
the
more
loose
amongst
women
of
his
own
*NL*
class
.
Why
,
Leonora
told
me
that
Mrs
Maidan
--
the
woman
he
followed
from
*NL*
Burma
to
Nauheim
--
assured
her
he
awakened
her
attention
by
swearing
that
*NL*
when
he
kissed
the
servant
in
the
train
he
was
driven
to
it
.
I
daresay
*NL*
he
was
driven
to
it
,
by
the
mad
passion
to
find
an
ultimately
satisfying
*NL*
woman
.
I
daresay
he
was
sincere
enough
.
Heaven
help
me
,
I
daresay
he
was
*NL*
sincere
enough
in
his
love
for
Mrs
Maidan
.
She
was
a
nice
little
thing
,
*NL*
a
dear
little
dark
woman
with
long
lashes
,
of
whom
Florence
grew
quite
*NL*
fond
.
She
had
a
lisp
and
a
happy
smile
.
We
saw
plenty
of
her
for
the
*NL*
first
month
of
our
acquaintance
,
then
she
died
,
quite
quietly
--
of
heart
*NL*
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
you
know
,
poor
little
Mrs
Maidan
--
she
was
so
gentle
,
so
young
.
She
*NL*
can
not
have
been
more
than
twenty-three
and
she
had
a
boy
husband
out
in
*NL*
Chitral
not
more
than
twenty-four
,
I
believe
.
Such
young
things
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
left
alone
.
Of
course
Ashburnham
could
not
leave
her
alone
.
I
*NL*
do
not
believe
that
he
could
.
Why
,
even
I
,
at
this
distance
of
time
am
*NL*
aware
that
I
am
a
little
in
love
with
her
memory
.
I
ca
n't
help
smiling
*NL*
when
I
think
suddenly
of
her
--
as
you
might
at
the
thought
of
something
*NL*
wrapped
carefully
away
in
lavender
,
in
some
drawer
,
in
some
old
house
*NL*
that
you
have
long
left
.
She
was
so
--
so
submissive
.
Why
,
even
to
me
she
*NL*
had
the
air
of
being
submissive
--
to
me
that
not
the
youngest
child
will
*NL*
ever
pay
heed
to
.
Yes
,
this
is
the
saddest
story
...
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
I
can
not
help
wishing
that
Florence
had
left
her
alone
--
with
her
*NL*
playing
with
adultery
.
I
suppose
it
was
;
though
she
was
such
a
child
*NL*
that
one
has
the
impression
that
she
would
hardly
have
known
how
to
*NL*
spell
such
a
word
.
No
,
it
was
just
submissiveness
--
to
the
importunities
,
*NL*
to
the
tempestuous
forces
that
pushed
that
miserable
fellow
on
to
ruin
.
*NL*
And
I
do
not
suppose
that
Florence
really
made
much
difference
.
If
it
*NL*
had
not
been
for
her
that
Ashburnham
left
his
allegiance
for
Mrs
Maidan
,
*NL*
then
it
would
have
been
some
other
woman
.
But
still
,
I
do
not
know
.
*NL*
Perhaps
the
poor
young
thing
would
have
died
--
she
was
bound
to
die
,
*NL*
anyhow
,
quite
soon
--
but
she
would
have
died
without
having
to
soak
her
*NL*
noonday
pillow
with
tears
whilst
Florence
,
below
the
window
,
talked
to
*NL*
Captain
Ashburnham
about
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
...
Yes
,
*NL*
it
would
have
left
a
better
taste
in
the
mouth
if
Florence
had
let
her
*NL*
die
in
peace
...
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
behaved
better
in
a
sense
.
She
just
boxed
Mrs
Maidan
's
*NL*
ears
--
yes
,
she
hit
her
,
in
an
uncontrollable
access
of
rage
,
a
hard
blow
*NL*
on
the
side
of
the
cheek
,
in
the
corridor
of
the
hotel
,
outside
Edward
's
*NL*
rooms
.
It
was
that
,
you
know
,
that
accounted
for
the
sudden
,
odd
*NL*
intimacy
that
sprang
up
between
Florence
and
Mrs
Ashburnham
.
Because
*NL*
it
was
,
of
course
,
an
odd
intimacy
.
If
you
look
at
it
from
the
outside
*NL*
nothing
could
have
been
more
unlikely
than
that
Leonora
,
who
is
*NL*
the
proudest
creature
on
God
's
earth
,
would
have
struck
up
an
*NL*
acquaintanceship
with
two
casual
Yankees
whom
she
could
not
really
have
*NL*
regarded
as
being
much
more
than
a
carpet
beneath
her
feet
.
You
may
*NL*
ask
what
she
had
to
be
proud
of
.
Well
,
she
was
a
Powys
married
to
*NL*
an
Ashburnham
--
I
suppose
that
gave
her
the
right
to
despise
casual
*NL*
Americans
as
long
as
she
did
it
unostentatiously
.
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
anyone
has
to
be
proud
of
.
She
might
have
taken
pride
in
her
patience
,
*NL*
in
her
keeping
her
husband
out
of
the
bankruptcy
court
.
Perhaps
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
rate
that
was
how
Florence
got
to
know
her
.
She
came
round
a
*NL*
screen
at
the
corner
of
the
hotel
corridor
and
found
Leonora
with
the
*NL*
gold
key
that
hung
from
her
wrist
caught
in
Mrs
Maidan
's
hair
just
*NL*
before
dinner
.
There
was
not
a
single
word
spoken
.
Little
Mrs
Maidan
was
*NL*
very
pale
,
with
a
red
mark
down
her
left
cheek
,
and
the
key
would
not
*NL*
come
out
of
her
black
hair
.
It
was
Florence
who
had
to
disentangle
it
,
*NL*
for
Leonora
was
in
such
a
state
that
she
could
not
have
brought
herself
*NL*
to
touch
Mrs
Maidan
without
growing
sick
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
not
a
word
spoken
.
You
see
,
under
those
four
eyes
--
her
own
*NL*
and
Mrs
Maidan
's
--
Leonora
could
just
let
herself
go
as
far
as
to
box
Mrs
*NL*
Maidan
's
ears
.
But
the
moment
a
stranger
came
along
she
pulled
herself
*NL*
wonderfully
up
.
She
was
at
first
silent
and
then
,
the
moment
the
key
was
*NL*
disengaged
by
Florence
she
was
in
a
state
to
say
:
``
So
awkward
of
me
...
I
*NL*
was
just
trying
to
put
the
comb
straight
in
Mrs
Maidan
's
hair
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Maidan
,
however
,
was
not
a
Powys
married
to
an
Ashburnham
;
she
was
*NL*
a
poor
little
O'Flaherty
whose
husband
was
a
boy
of
country
parsonage
*NL*
origin
.
So
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sob
she
let
go
as
she
went
*NL*
desolately
away
along
the
corridor
.
But
Leonora
was
still
going
to
play
*NL*
up
.
She
opened
the
door
of
Ashburnham
's
room
quite
ostentatiously
,
so
*NL*
that
Florence
should
hear
her
address
Edward
in
terms
of
intimacy
and
*NL*
liking
.
``
Edward
,
''
she
called
.
But
there
was
no
Edward
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
understand
that
there
was
no
Edward
there
.
It
was
then
,
for
the
*NL*
only
time
of
her
career
,
that
Leonora
really
compromised
herself
--
She
*NL*
exclaimed
...
``
How
frightful
!
...
Poor
little
Maisie
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
caught
herself
up
at
that
,
but
of
course
it
was
too
late
.
It
was
a
*NL*
queer
sort
of
affair
...
*NL*
*NL*
I
want
to
do
Leonora
every
justice
.
I
love
her
very
dearly
for
one
thing
*NL*
and
in
this
matter
,
which
was
certainly
the
ruin
of
my
small
household
*NL*
cockle-shell
,
she
certainly
tripped
up
.
I
do
not
believe
--
and
Leonora
*NL*
herself
does
not
believe
--
that
poor
little
Maisie
Maidan
was
ever
*NL*
Edward
's
mistress
.
Her
heart
was
really
so
bad
that
she
would
have
*NL*
succumbed
to
anything
like
an
impassioned
embrace
.
That
is
the
plain
*NL*
English
of
it
,
and
I
suppose
plain
English
is
best
.
She
was
really
what
*NL*
the
other
two
,
for
reasons
of
their
own
,
just
pretended
to
be
.
Queer
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
?
Like
one
of
those
sinister
jokes
that
Providence
plays
upon
*NL*
one
.
Add
to
this
that
I
do
not
suppose
that
Leonora
would
much
have
*NL*
minded
,
at
any
other
moment
,
if
Mrs
Maidan
had
been
her
husband
's
*NL*
mistress
.
It
might
have
been
a
relief
from
Edward
's
sentimental
*NL*
gurglings
over
the
lady
and
from
the
lady
's
submissive
acceptance
of
*NL*
those
sounds
.
No
,
she
would
not
have
minded
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
boxing
Mrs
Maidan
's
ears
,
Leonora
was
just
striking
the
face
of
*NL*
an
intolerable
universe
.
For
,
that
afternoon
she
had
had
a
frightfully
*NL*
painful
scene
with
Edward
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
far
as
his
letters
went
,
she
claimed
the
right
to
open
them
when
she
*NL*
chose
.
She
arrogated
to
herself
the
right
because
Edward
's
affairs
were
*NL*
in
such
a
frightful
state
and
he
lied
so
about
them
that
she
claimed
the
*NL*
privilege
of
having
his
secrets
at
her
disposal
.
There
was
not
,
indeed
,
*NL*
any
other
way
,
for
the
poor
fool
was
too
ashamed
of
his
lapses
ever
to
*NL*
make
a
clean
breast
of
anything
.
She
had
to
drag
these
things
out
of
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
have
been
a
pretty
elevating
job
for
her
.
But
that
afternoon
,
*NL*
Edward
being
on
his
bed
for
the
hour
and
a
half
prescribed
by
the
*NL*
Kur
authorities
,
she
had
opened
a
letter
that
she
took
to
come
from
a
*NL*
Colonel
Hervey
.
They
were
going
to
stay
with
him
in
Linlithgowshire
for
*NL*
the
month
of
September
and
she
did
not
know
whether
the
date
fixed
would
*NL*
be
the
eleventh
or
the
eighteenth
.
The
address
on
this
letter
was
,
*NL*
in
handwriting
,
as
like
Colonel
Hervey
's
as
one
blade
of
corn
is
like
*NL*
another
.
So
she
had
at
the
moment
no
idea
of
spying
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
certainly
was
.
For
she
discovered
that
Edward
Ashburnham
was
*NL*
paying
a
blackmailer
of
whom
she
had
never
heard
something
like
three
*NL*
hundred
pounds
a
year
...
It
was
a
devil
of
a
blow
;
it
was
like
death
;
*NL*
for
she
imagined
that
by
that
time
she
had
really
got
to
the
bottom
of
*NL*
her
husband
's
liabilities
.
You
see
,
they
were
pretty
heavy
.
What
had
*NL*
really
smashed
them
up
had
been
a
perfectly
common-place
affair
at
Monte
*NL*
Carlo
--
an
affair
with
a
cosmopolitan
harpy
who
passed
for
the
mistress
*NL*
of
a
Russian
Grand
Duke
.
She
exacted
a
twenty
thousand
pound
pearl
tiara
*NL*
from
him
as
the
price
of
her
favours
for
a
week
or
so
.
It
would
have
*NL*
pipped
him
a
good
deal
to
have
found
so
much
,
and
he
was
not
in
the
*NL*
ordinary
way
a
gambler
.
He
might
,
indeed
,
just
have
found
the
twenty
*NL*
thousand
and
the
not
slight
charges
of
a
week
at
an
hotel
with
the
fair
*NL*
creature
.
He
must
have
been
worth
at
that
date
five
hundred
thousand
*NL*
dollars
and
a
little
over
.
Well
,
he
must
needs
go
to
the
tables
and
lose
*NL*
forty
thousand
pounds
...
Forty
thousand
solid
pounds
,
borrowed
from
*NL*
sharks
!
And
even
after
that
he
must
--
it
was
an
imperative
passion
--
enjoy
*NL*
the
favours
of
the
lady
.
He
got
them
,
of
course
,
when
it
was
a
matter
*NL*
of
solid
bargaining
,
for
far
less
than
twenty
thousand
,
as
he
might
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
have
done
from
the
first
.
I
daresay
ten
thousand
dollars
covered
*NL*
the
bill
.
Anyhow
,
there
was
a
pretty
solid
hole
in
a
fortune
of
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
pounds
or
so
.
And
Leonora
had
to
fix
things
up
;
he
*NL*
would
have
run
from
money-lender
to
money-lender
.
And
that
was
quite
in
*NL*
the
early
days
of
her
discovery
of
his
infidelities
--
if
you
like
to
call
*NL*
them
infidelities
.
And
she
discovered
that
one
from
public
sources
.
God
*NL*
knows
what
would
have
happened
if
she
had
not
discovered
it
from
public
*NL*
sources
.
I
suppose
he
would
have
concealed
it
from
her
until
they
were
*NL*
penniless
.
But
she
was
able
,
by
the
grace
of
God
,
to
get
hold
of
the
*NL*
actual
lenders
of
the
money
,
to
learn
the
exact
sums
that
were
needed
.
*NL*
And
she
went
off
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
she
went
right
off
to
England
to
her
attorney
and
his
while
he
*NL*
was
still
in
the
arms
of
his
Circe
--
at
Antibes
,
to
which
place
they
had
*NL*
retired
.
He
got
sick
of
the
lady
quite
quickly
,
but
not
before
Leonora
*NL*
had
had
such
lessons
in
the
art
of
business
from
her
attorney
that
she
*NL*
had
her
plan
as
clearly
drawn
up
as
was
ever
that
of
General
Trochu
for
*NL*
keeping
the
Prussians
out
of
Paris
in
1870
.
It
was
about
as
effectual
at
*NL*
first
,
or
it
seemed
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
would
have
been
,
you
know
,
in
1895
,
about
nine
years
before
the
*NL*
date
of
which
I
am
talking
--
the
date
of
Florence
's
getting
her
hold
over
*NL*
Leonora
;
for
that
was
what
it
amounted
to
...
Well
,
Mrs
Ashburnham
had
*NL*
simply
forced
Edward
to
settle
all
his
property
upon
her
.
She
could
*NL*
force
him
to
do
anything
;
in
his
clumsy
,
good-natured
,
inarticulate
*NL*
way
he
was
as
frightened
of
her
as
of
the
devil
.
And
he
admired
her
*NL*
enormously
,
and
he
was
as
fond
of
her
as
any
man
could
be
of
any
woman
.
*NL*
She
took
advantage
of
it
to
treat
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
person
whose
*NL*
estates
are
being
managed
by
the
Court
of
Bankruptcy
.
I
suppose
it
was
*NL*
the
best
thing
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anyhow
,
she
had
no
end
of
a
job
for
the
first
three
years
or
so
.
*NL*
Unexpected
liabilities
kept
on
cropping
up
--
and
that
afflicted
fool
did
*NL*
not
make
it
any
easier
.
You
see
,
along
with
the
passion
of
the
chase
*NL*
went
a
frame
of
mind
that
made
him
be
extraordinarily
ashamed
of
*NL*
himself
.
You
may
not
believe
it
,
but
he
really
had
such
a
sort
of
*NL*
respect
for
the
chastity
of
Leonora
's
imagination
that
he
hated
--
he
was
*NL*
positively
revolted
at
the
thought
that
she
should
know
that
the
sort
*NL*
of
thing
that
he
did
existed
in
the
world
.
So
he
would
stick
out
in
an
*NL*
agitated
way
against
the
accusation
of
ever
having
done
anything
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
preserve
the
virginity
of
his
wife
's
thoughts
.
He
told
me
that
*NL*
himself
during
the
long
walks
we
had
at
the
last
--
while
the
girl
was
on
*NL*
the
way
to
Brindisi
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
of
course
,
for
those
three
years
or
so
,
Leonora
had
many
agitations
.
*NL*
And
it
was
then
that
they
really
quarrelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
they
quarrelled
bitterly
.
That
seems
rather
extravagant
.
You
*NL*
might
have
thought
that
Leonora
would
be
just
calmly
loathing
and
he
*NL*
lachrymosely
contrite
.
But
that
was
not
it
a
bit
...
Along
with
Edward
's
*NL*
passions
and
his
shame
for
them
went
the
violent
conviction
of
the
*NL*
duties
of
his
station
--
a
conviction
that
was
quite
unreasonably
*NL*
expensive
.
I
trust
I
have
not
,
in
talking
of
his
liabilities
,
given
the
*NL*
impression
that
poor
Edward
was
a
promiscuous
libertine
.
He
was
not
;
*NL*
he
was
a
sentimentalist
.
The
servant
girl
in
the
Kilsyte
case
had
been
*NL*
pretty
,
but
mournful
of
appearance
.
I
think
that
,
when
he
had
kissed
*NL*
her
,
he
had
desired
rather
to
comfort
her
.
And
,
if
she
had
succumbed
to
*NL*
his
blandishments
I
daresay
he
would
have
set
her
up
in
a
little
house
*NL*
in
Portsmouth
or
Winchester
and
would
have
been
faithful
to
her
for
four
*NL*
or
five
years
.
He
was
quite
capable
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
the
only
two
of
his
affairs
of
the
heart
that
cost
him
money
were
*NL*
that
of
the
Grand
Duke
's
mistress
and
that
which
was
the
subject
of
*NL*
the
blackmailing
letter
that
Leonora
opened
.
That
had
been
a
quite
*NL*
passionate
affair
with
quite
a
nice
woman
.
It
had
succeeded
the
one
with
*NL*
the
Grand
Ducal
lady
.
The
lady
was
the
wife
of
a
brother
officer
and
*NL*
Leonora
had
known
all
about
the
passion
,
which
had
been
quite
a
real
*NL*
passion
and
had
lasted
for
several
years
.
You
see
,
poor
Edward
's
*NL*
passions
were
quite
logical
in
their
progression
upwards
.
They
began
*NL*
with
a
servant
,
went
on
to
a
courtesan
and
then
to
a
quite
nice
woman
,
*NL*
very
unsuitably
mated
.
For
she
had
a
quite
nasty
husband
who
,
by
means
*NL*
of
letters
and
things
,
went
on
blackmailing
poor
Edward
to
the
tune
of
*NL*
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
--
with
threats
of
the
Divorce
Court
.
And
*NL*
after
this
lady
came
Maisie
Maidan
,
and
after
poor
Maisie
only
one
more
*NL*
affair
and
then
--
the
real
passion
of
his
life
.
His
marriage
with
Leonora
*NL*
had
been
arranged
by
his
parents
and
,
though
he
always
admired
her
*NL*
immensely
,
he
had
hardly
ever
pretended
to
be
much
more
than
tender
to
*NL*
her
,
though
he
desperately
needed
her
moral
support
,
too
...
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
really
trying
liabilities
were
mostly
in
the
nature
of
*NL*
generosities
proper
to
his
station
.
He
was
,
according
to
Leonora
,
always
*NL*
remitting
his
tenants
'
rents
and
giving
the
tenants
to
understand
that
*NL*
the
reduction
would
be
permanent
;
he
was
always
redeeming
drunkards
*NL*
who
came
before
his
magisterial
bench
;
he
was
always
trying
to
put
*NL*
prostitutes
into
respectable
places
--
and
he
was
a
perfect
maniac
about
*NL*
children
.
I
do
n't
know
how
many
ill-used
people
he
did
not
pick
up
and
*NL*
provide
with
careers
--
Leonora
has
told
me
,
but
I
daresay
she
exaggerated
*NL*
and
the
figure
seems
so
preposterous
that
I
will
not
put
it
down
.
*NL*
All
these
things
,
and
the
continuance
of
them
seemed
to
him
to
be
his
*NL*
duty
--
along
with
impossible
subscriptions
to
hospitals
and
Boy
Scouts
*NL*
and
to
provide
prizes
at
cattle
shows
and
antivivisection
societies
...
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
Leonora
saw
to
it
that
most
of
these
things
were
not
continued
.
*NL*
They
could
not
possibly
keep
up
Branshaw
Manor
at
that
rate
after
the
*NL*
money
had
gone
to
the
Grand
Duke
's
mistress
.
She
put
the
rents
back
at
*NL*
their
old
figures
;
discharged
the
drunkards
from
their
homes
,
and
sent
*NL*
all
the
societies
notice
that
they
were
to
expect
no
more
subscriptions
.
*NL*
To
the
children
,
she
was
more
tender
;
nearly
all
of
them
she
supported
*NL*
till
the
age
of
apprenticeship
or
domestic
service
.
You
see
,
she
was
*NL*
childless
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
childless
herself
,
and
she
considered
herself
to
be
to
blame
.
*NL*
She
had
come
of
a
penniless
branch
of
the
Powys
family
,
and
they
had
*NL*
forced
upon
her
poor
dear
Edward
without
making
the
stipulation
that
*NL*
the
children
should
be
brought
up
as
Catholics
.
And
that
,
of
course
,
*NL*
was
spiritual
death
to
Leonora
.
I
have
given
you
a
wrong
impression
if
*NL*
I
have
not
made
you
see
that
Leonora
was
a
woman
of
a
strong
,
cold
*NL*
conscience
,
like
all
English
Catholics
.
-LRB-
I
can
not
,
myself
,
help
*NL*
disliking
this
religion
;
there
is
always
,
at
the
bottom
of
my
mind
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
Leonora
,
the
feeling
of
shuddering
at
the
Scarlet
Woman
,
*NL*
that
filtered
in
upon
me
in
the
tranquility
of
the
little
old
Friends
'
*NL*
Meeting
House
in
Arch
Street
,
Philadelphia
.
-RRB-
So
I
do
set
down
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
Leonora
's
mismanagement
of
poor
dear
Edward
's
case
to
the
*NL*
peculiarly
English
form
of
her
religion
.
Because
,
of
course
,
the
only
*NL*
thing
to
have
done
for
Edward
would
have
been
to
let
him
sink
down
until
*NL*
he
became
a
tramp
of
gentlemanly
address
,
having
,
maybe
,
chance
love
*NL*
affairs
upon
the
highways
.
He
would
have
done
so
much
less
harm
;
he
*NL*
would
have
been
much
less
agonized
too
.
At
any
rate
,
he
would
have
*NL*
had
fewer
chances
of
ruining
and
of
remorse
.
For
Edward
was
great
*NL*
at
remorse
.
But
Leonora
's
English
Catholic
conscience
,
her
rigid
*NL*
principles
,
her
coldness
,
even
her
very
patience
,
were
,
I
can
not
help
*NL*
thinking
,
all
wrong
in
this
special
case
.
She
quite
seriously
and
*NL*
naively
imagined
that
the
Church
of
Rome
disapproves
of
divorce
;
she
*NL*
quite
seriously
and
naively
believed
that
her
church
could
be
such
*NL*
a
monstrous
and
imbecile
institution
as
to
expect
her
to
take
on
the
*NL*
impossible
job
of
making
Edward
Ashburnham
a
faithful
husband
.
She
had
,
*NL*
as
the
English
would
say
,
the
Nonconformist
temperament
.
In
the
United
*NL*
States
of
North
America
we
call
it
the
New
England
conscience
.
For
,
of
*NL*
course
,
that
frame
of
mind
has
been
driven
in
on
the
English
Catholics
.
*NL*
The
centuries
that
they
have
gone
through
--
centuries
of
blind
and
*NL*
malignant
oppression
,
of
ostracism
from
public
employment
,
of
being
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
a
small
beleagured
garrison
in
a
hostile
country
,
and
therefore
*NL*
having
to
act
with
great
formality
--
all
these
things
have
combined
to
*NL*
perform
that
conjuring
trick
.
And
I
suppose
that
Papists
in
England
are
*NL*
even
technically
Nonconformists
.
*NL*
*NL*
Continental
Papists
are
a
dirty
,
jovial
and
unscrupulous
crew
.
But
that
,
*NL*
at
least
,
lets
them
be
opportunists
.
They
would
have
fixed
poor
dear
*NL*
Edward
up
all
right
.
-LRB-
Forgive
my
writing
of
these
monstrous
things
in
*NL*
this
frivolous
manner
.
If
I
did
not
I
should
break
down
and
cry
.
-RRB-
In
*NL*
Milan
,
say
,
or
in
Paris
,
Leonora
would
have
had
her
marriage
dissolved
*NL*
in
six
months
for
two
hundred
dollars
paid
in
the
right
quarter
.
And
*NL*
Edward
would
have
drifted
about
until
he
became
a
tramp
of
the
kind
I
*NL*
have
suggested
.
Or
he
would
have
married
a
barmaid
who
would
have
made
*NL*
him
such
frightful
scenes
in
public
places
and
would
so
have
torn
out
*NL*
his
moustache
and
left
visible
signs
upon
his
face
that
he
would
have
*NL*
been
faithful
to
her
for
the
rest
of
his
days
.
That
was
what
he
wanted
*NL*
to
redeem
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
along
with
his
passions
and
his
shames
there
went
the
dread
of
*NL*
scenes
in
public
places
,
of
outcry
,
of
excited
physical
violence
;
of
*NL*
publicity
,
in
short
.
Yes
,
the
barmaid
would
have
cured
him
.
And
it
would
*NL*
have
been
all
the
better
if
she
drank
;
he
would
have
been
kept
busy
*NL*
looking
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
that
I
am
right
in
this
.
I
know
it
because
of
the
Kilsyte
case
.
*NL*
You
see
,
the
servant
girl
that
he
then
kissed
was
nurse
in
the
family
of
*NL*
the
Nonconformist
head
of
the
county
--
whatever
that
post
may
be
called
.
*NL*
And
that
gentleman
was
so
determined
to
ruin
Edward
,
who
was
the
*NL*
chairman
of
the
Tory
caucus
,
or
whatever
it
is
--
that
the
poor
dear
*NL*
sufferer
had
the
very
devil
of
a
time
.
They
asked
questions
about
it
*NL*
in
the
House
of
Commons
;
they
tried
to
get
the
Hampshire
magistrates
*NL*
degraded
;
they
suggested
to
the
War
Ministry
that
Edward
was
not
the
*NL*
proper
person
to
hold
the
King
's
commission
.
Yes
,
he
got
it
hot
and
*NL*
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
you
have
heard
.
He
was
completely
cured
of
philandering
*NL*
amongst
the
lower
classes
.
And
that
seemed
a
real
blessing
to
Leonora
.
*NL*
It
did
not
revolt
her
so
much
to
be
connected
--
it
is
a
sort
of
*NL*
connection
--
with
people
like
Mrs
Maidan
,
instead
of
with
a
little
*NL*
kitchenmaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
dim
sort
of
way
,
Leonora
was
almost
contented
when
she
arrived
at
*NL*
Nauheim
,
that
evening
...
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
got
things
nearly
straight
by
the
long
years
of
scraping
in
*NL*
little
stations
in
Chitral
and
Burma
--
stations
where
living
is
cheap
*NL*
in
comparison
with
the
life
of
a
county
magnate
,
and
where
,
moreover
,
*NL*
liaisons
of
one
sort
or
another
are
normal
and
inexpensive
too
.
So
that
,
*NL*
when
Mrs
Maidan
came
along
--
and
the
Maidan
affair
might
have
caused
*NL*
trouble
out
there
because
of
the
youth
of
the
husband
--
Leonora
had
just
*NL*
resigned
herself
to
coming
home
.
With
pushing
and
scraping
and
with
*NL*
letting
Branshaw
Teleragh
,
and
with
selling
a
picture
and
a
relic
of
*NL*
Charles
I
or
so
,
had
got
--
and
,
poor
dear
,
she
had
never
had
a
really
*NL*
decent
dress
to
her
back
in
all
those
years
and
years
--
she
had
got
,
as
*NL*
she
imagined
,
her
poor
dear
husband
back
into
much
the
same
financial
*NL*
position
as
had
been
his
before
the
mistress
of
the
Grand
Duke
had
*NL*
happened
along
.
And
,
of
course
,
Edward
himself
had
helped
her
a
little
*NL*
on
the
financial
side
.
He
was
a
fellow
that
many
men
liked
.
He
was
so
*NL*
presentable
and
quite
ready
to
lend
you
his
cigar
puncher
--
that
sort
*NL*
of
thing
.
So
,
every
now
and
then
some
financier
whom
he
met
about
would
*NL*
give
him
a
good
,
sound
,
profitable
tip
.
And
Leonora
was
never
afraid
of
*NL*
a
bit
of
a
gamble
--
English
Papists
seldom
are
,
I
do
not
know
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
nearly
all
her
investment
turned
up
trumps
,
and
Edward
was
really
in
*NL*
fit
case
to
reopen
Branshaw
Manor
and
once
more
to
assume
his
position
*NL*
in
the
county
.
Thus
Leonora
had
accepted
Maisie
Maidan
almost
with
*NL*
resignation
--
almost
with
a
sigh
of
relief
.
She
really
liked
the
poor
*NL*
child
--
she
had
to
like
somebody
.
And
,
at
any
rate
,
she
felt
she
could
*NL*
trust
Maisie
--
she
could
trust
her
not
to
rook
Edward
for
several
*NL*
thousands
a
week
,
for
Maisie
had
refused
to
accept
so
much
as
a
trinket
*NL*
ring
from
him
.
It
is
true
that
Edward
gurgled
and
raved
about
the
girl
*NL*
in
a
way
that
she
had
never
yet
experienced
.
But
that
,
too
,
was
almost
a
*NL*
relief
.
I
think
she
would
really
have
welcomed
it
if
he
could
have
come
*NL*
across
the
love
of
his
life
.
It
would
have
given
her
a
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
could
not
have
been
anyone
better
than
poor
little
Mrs
Maidan
;
*NL*
she
was
so
ill
she
could
not
want
to
be
taken
on
expensive
jaunts
...
*NL*
It
was
Leonora
herself
who
paid
Maisie
's
expenses
to
Nauheim
.
She
handed
*NL*
over
the
money
to
the
boy
husband
,
for
Maisie
would
never
have
allowed
*NL*
it
;
but
the
husband
was
in
agonies
of
fear
.
Poor
devil
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
fancy
that
,
on
the
voyage
from
India
,
Leonora
was
as
happy
as
ever
she
*NL*
had
been
in
her
life
.
Edward
was
wrapped
up
,
completely
,
in
his
girl
--
he
*NL*
was
almost
like
a
father
with
a
child
,
trotting
about
with
rugs
and
*NL*
physic
and
things
,
from
deck
to
deck
.
He
behaved
,
however
,
with
great
*NL*
circumspection
,
so
that
nothing
leaked
through
to
the
other
passengers
.
*NL*
And
Leonora
had
almost
attained
to
the
attitude
of
a
mother
towards
Mrs
*NL*
Maidan
.
So
it
had
looked
very
well
--
the
benevolent
,
wealthy
couple
of
*NL*
good
people
,
acting
as
saviours
to
the
poor
,
dark-eyed
,
dying
young
*NL*
thing
.
And
that
attitude
of
Leonora
's
towards
Mrs
Maidan
no
doubt
partly
*NL*
accounted
for
the
smack
in
the
face
.
She
was
hitting
a
naughty
child
who
*NL*
had
been
stealing
chocolates
at
an
inopportune
moment
.
It
was
certainly
*NL*
an
inopportune
moment
.
For
,
with
the
opening
of
that
blackmailing
letter
*NL*
from
that
injured
brother
officer
,
all
the
old
terrors
had
redescended
*NL*
upon
Leonora
.
Her
road
had
again
seemed
to
stretch
out
endless
;
she
*NL*
imagined
that
there
might
be
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
such
things
*NL*
that
Edward
was
concealing
from
her
--
that
they
might
necessitate
more
*NL*
mortgagings
,
more
pawnings
of
bracelets
,
more
and
always
more
horrors
.
*NL*
She
had
spent
an
excruciating
afternoon
.
The
matter
was
one
of
a
divorce
*NL*
case
,
of
course
,
and
she
wanted
to
avoid
publicity
as
much
as
Edward
*NL*
did
,
so
that
she
saw
the
necessity
of
continuing
the
payments
.
And
she
*NL*
did
not
so
much
mind
that
.
They
could
find
three
hundred
a
year
.
But
it
*NL*
was
the
horror
of
there
being
more
such
obligations
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
had
no
conversation
with
Edward
for
many
years
--
none
that
went
*NL*
beyond
the
mere
arrangements
for
taking
trains
or
engaging
servants
.
But
*NL*
that
afternoon
she
had
to
let
him
have
it
.
And
he
had
been
just
the
same
*NL*
as
ever
.
It
was
like
opening
a
book
after
a
decade
to
find
the
words
the
*NL*
same
.
He
had
the
same
motives
.
He
had
not
wished
to
tell
her
about
the
*NL*
case
because
he
had
not
wished
her
to
sully
her
mind
with
the
idea
*NL*
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
brother
officer
who
could
be
a
*NL*
blackmailer
--
and
he
had
wanted
to
protect
the
credit
of
his
old
light
*NL*
of
love
.
That
lady
was
certainly
not
concerned
with
her
husband
.
And
he
*NL*
swore
,
and
swore
,
and
swore
,
that
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
world
*NL*
against
him
.
She
did
not
believe
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
done
it
once
too
often
--
and
she
was
wrong
for
the
first
time
,
so
*NL*
that
he
acted
a
rather
creditable
part
in
the
matter
.
For
he
went
right
*NL*
straight
out
to
the
post-office
and
spent
several
hours
in
coding
a
*NL*
telegram
to
his
solicitor
,
bidding
that
hard-headed
man
to
threaten
to
*NL*
take
out
at
once
a
warrant
against
the
fellow
who
was
on
his
track
.
He
*NL*
said
afterwards
that
it
was
a
bit
too
thick
on
poor
old
Leonora
to
*NL*
be
ballyragged
any
more
.
That
was
really
the
last
of
his
outstanding
*NL*
accounts
,
and
he
was
ready
to
take
his
personal
chance
of
the
Divorce
*NL*
Court
if
the
blackmailer
turned
nasty
.
He
would
face
it
out
--
the
*NL*
publicity
,
the
papers
,
the
whole
bally
show
.
Those
were
his
simple
*NL*
words
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
made
,
however
,
the
mistake
of
not
telling
Leonora
where
he
was
*NL*
going
,
so
that
,
having
seen
him
go
to
his
room
to
fetch
the
code
for
*NL*
the
telegram
,
and
seeing
,
two
hours
later
,
Maisie
Maidan
come
out
of
his
*NL*
room
,
Leonora
imagined
that
the
two
hours
she
had
spent
in
silent
agony
*NL*
Edward
had
spent
with
Maisie
Maidan
in
his
arms
.
That
seemed
to
her
to
*NL*
be
too
much
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
Maisie
's
being
in
Edward
's
room
had
*NL*
been
the
result
,
partly
of
poverty
,
partly
of
pride
,
partly
of
sheer
*NL*
innocence
.
She
could
not
,
in
the
first
place
,
afford
a
maid
;
she
*NL*
refrained
as
much
as
possible
from
sending
the
hotel
servants
on
*NL*
errands
,
since
every
penny
was
of
importance
to
her
,
and
she
feared
to
*NL*
have
to
pay
high
tips
at
the
end
of
her
stay
.
Edward
had
lent
her
one
*NL*
of
his
fascinating
cases
containing
fifteen
different
sizes
of
scissors
,
*NL*
and
,
having
seen
from
her
window
,
his
departure
for
the
post-office
,
she
*NL*
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
returning
the
case
.
She
could
not
see
why
*NL*
she
should
not
,
though
she
felt
a
certain
remorse
at
the
thought
that
*NL*
she
had
kissed
the
pillows
of
his
bed
.
That
was
the
way
it
took
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Leonora
could
see
that
,
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
,
the
incident
*NL*
gave
Florence
a
hold
over
her
.
It
let
Florence
into
things
and
Florence
*NL*
was
the
only
created
being
who
had
any
idea
that
the
Ashburnhams
were
*NL*
not
just
good
people
with
nothing
to
their
tails
.
She
determined
at
*NL*
once
,
not
so
much
to
give
Florence
the
privilege
of
her
intimacy
--
which
*NL*
would
have
been
the
payment
of
a
kind
of
blackmail
--
as
to
keep
Florence
*NL*
under
observation
until
she
could
have
demonstrated
to
Florence
that
*NL*
she
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
of
poor
Maisie
.
So
that
was
why
she
*NL*
had
entered
the
dining-room
arm
in
arm
with
my
wife
,
and
why
she
had
so
*NL*
markedly
planted
herself
at
our
table
.
She
never
left
us
,
indeed
,
for
a
*NL*
minute
that
night
,
except
just
to
run
up
to
Mrs
Maidan
's
room
to
beg
her
*NL*
pardon
and
to
beg
her
also
to
let
Edward
take
her
very
markedly
out
into
*NL*
the
gardens
that
night
.
She
said
herself
,
when
Mrs
Maidan
came
rather
*NL*
wistfully
down
into
the
lounge
where
we
were
all
sitting
:
``
Now
,
Edward
,
*NL*
get
up
and
take
Maisie
to
the
Casino
.
I
want
Mrs
Dowell
to
tell
me
all
*NL*
about
the
families
in
Connecticut
who
came
from
Fordingbridge
.
''
For
it
*NL*
had
been
discovered
that
Florence
came
of
a
line
that
had
actually
owned
*NL*
Branshaw
Teleragh
for
two
centuries
before
the
Ashburnhams
came
there
.
*NL*
And
there
she
sat
with
me
in
that
hall
,
long
after
Florence
had
gone
to
*NL*
bed
,
so
that
I
might
witness
her
gay
reception
of
that
pair
.
She
could
*NL*
play
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
enables
me
to
fix
exactly
the
day
of
our
going
to
the
town
of
*NL*
M
--
.
For
it
was
the
very
day
poor
Mrs
Maidan
died
.
We
found
her
dead
*NL*
when
we
got
back
--
pretty
awful
,
that
,
when
you
come
to
figure
out
what
*NL*
it
all
means
...
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
rate
the
measure
of
my
relief
when
Leonora
said
that
she
was
an
*NL*
Irish
Catholic
gives
you
the
measure
of
my
affection
for
that
couple
.
*NL*
It
was
an
affection
so
intense
that
even
to
this
day
I
can
not
think
of
*NL*
Edward
without
sighing
.
I
do
not
believe
that
I
could
have
gone
on
any
*NL*
more
with
them
.
I
was
getting
too
tired
.
And
I
verily
believe
,
too
,
if
*NL*
my
suspicion
that
Leonora
was
jealous
of
Florence
had
been
the
reason
*NL*
she
gave
for
her
outburst
I
should
have
turned
upon
Florence
with
the
*NL*
maddest
kind
of
rage
.
Jealousy
would
have
been
incurable
.
But
Florence
's
*NL*
mere
silly
jibes
at
the
Irish
and
at
the
Catholics
could
be
apologized
*NL*
out
of
existence
.
And
that
I
appeared
to
fix
up
in
two
minutes
or
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
for
a
long
time
rather
fixedly
and
queerly
while
I
was
*NL*
doing
it
.
And
at
last
I
worked
myself
up
to
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
accept
the
situation
.
I
confess
that
I
do
not
like
your
religion
.
*NL*
But
I
like
you
so
intensely
.
I
do
n't
mind
saying
that
I
have
never
had
*NL*
anyone
to
be
really
fond
of
,
and
I
do
not
believe
that
anyone
has
ever
*NL*
been
fond
of
me
,
as
I
believe
you
really
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
fond
enough
of
you
,
''
she
said
.
``
Fond
enough
to
say
that
I
wish
*NL*
every
man
was
like
you
.
But
there
are
others
to
be
considered
.
''
She
was
*NL*
thinking
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
of
poor
Maisie
.
She
picked
a
little
piece
*NL*
of
pellitory
out
of
the
breast-high
wall
in
front
of
us
.
She
chafed
it
*NL*
for
a
long
minute
between
her
finger
and
thumb
,
then
she
threw
it
over
*NL*
the
coping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
accept
the
situation
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
if
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
I
REMEMBER
laughing
at
the
phrase
,
``
accept
the
situation
''
,
which
she
*NL*
seemed
to
repeat
with
a
gravity
too
intense
.
I
said
to
her
something
*NL*
like
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
hardly
as
much
as
that
.
I
mean
,
that
I
must
claim
the
liberty
of
a
*NL*
free
American
citizen
to
think
what
I
please
about
your
co-religionists
.
*NL*
And
I
suppose
that
Florence
must
have
liberty
to
think
what
she
pleases
*NL*
and
to
say
what
politeness
allows
her
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
better
,
''
Leonora
answered
,
``
not
say
one
single
word
against
*NL*
my
people
or
my
faith
.
''
It
struck
me
at
the
time
,
that
there
was
an
*NL*
unusual
,
an
almost
threatening
,
hardness
in
her
voice
.
It
was
almost
*NL*
as
if
she
were
trying
to
convey
to
Florence
,
through
me
,
that
she
*NL*
would
seriously
harm
my
wife
if
Florence
went
to
something
that
was
an
*NL*
extreme
.
Yes
,
I
remember
thinking
at
the
time
that
it
was
almost
as
if
*NL*
Leonora
were
saying
,
through
me
to
Florence
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
outrage
me
as
you
will
;
you
may
take
all
that
I
personally
*NL*
possess
,
but
do
not
you
care
to
say
one
single
thing
in
view
of
the
*NL*
situation
that
that
will
set
up
--
against
the
faith
that
makes
me
become
*NL*
the
doormat
for
your
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
obviously
,
as
I
saw
it
,
that
could
not
be
her
meaning
.
Good
people
,
*NL*
be
they
ever
so
diverse
in
creed
,
do
not
threaten
each
other
.
So
that
I
*NL*
read
Leonora
's
words
to
mean
just
no
more
than
:
``
It
would
be
better
if
*NL*
Florence
said
nothing
at
all
against
my
co-religionists
,
because
it
is
a
*NL*
point
that
I
am
touchy
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
hint
that
,
accordingly
,
I
conveyed
to
Florence
when
,
*NL*
shortly
afterwards
,
she
and
Edward
came
down
from
the
tower
.
And
I
want
*NL*
you
to
understand
that
,
from
that
moment
until
after
Edward
and
the
girl
*NL*
and
Florence
were
all
dead
together
,
I
had
never
the
remotest
glimpse
,
*NL*
not
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
,
that
there
was
anything
wrong
,
as
the
*NL*
saying
is
.
For
five
minutes
,
then
,
I
entertained
the
possibility
that
*NL*
Leonora
might
be
jealous
;
but
there
was
never
another
flicker
in
that
*NL*
flame-like
personality
.
How
in
the
world
should
I
get
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
all
that
time
,
I
was
just
a
male
sick
nurse
.
And
what
chance
had
I
*NL*
against
those
three
hardened
gamblers
,
who
were
all
in
league
to
conceal
*NL*
their
hands
from
me
?
What
earthly
chance
?
They
were
three
to
one
--
and
*NL*
they
made
me
happy
.
Oh
God
,
they
made
me
so
happy
that
I
doubt
if
even
*NL*
paradise
,
that
shall
smooth
out
all
temporal
wrongs
,
shall
ever
give
me
*NL*
the
like
.
And
what
could
they
have
done
better
,
or
what
could
they
have
*NL*
done
that
could
have
been
worse
?
I
do
n't
know
...
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
that
,
during
all
that
time
I
was
a
deceived
husband
and
that
*NL*
Leonora
was
pimping
for
Edward
.
That
was
the
cross
that
she
had
to
take
*NL*
up
during
her
long
Calvary
of
a
life
...
*NL*
*NL*
You
ask
how
it
feels
to
be
a
deceived
husband
.
Just
Heavens
,
I
do
not
*NL*
know
.
It
feels
just
nothing
at
all
.
It
is
not
Hell
,
certainly
it
is
not
*NL*
necessarily
Heaven
.
So
I
suppose
it
is
the
intermediate
stage
.
What
*NL*
do
they
call
it
?
Limbo
.
No
,
I
feel
nothing
at
all
about
that
.
They
are
*NL*
dead
;
they
have
gone
before
their
Judge
who
,
I
hope
,
will
open
to
them
*NL*
the
springs
of
His
compassion
.
It
is
not
my
business
to
think
about
*NL*
it
.
It
is
simply
my
business
to
say
,
as
Leonora
's
people
say
:
``
Requiem
*NL*
aeternam
dona
eis
,
Do
mine
,
et
lux
perpetua
luceat
eis
.
In
memoria
*NL*
aeterna
erit
...
''
But
what
were
they
?
The
just
?
The
unjust
?
God
knows
!
I
*NL*
think
that
the
pair
of
them
were
only
poor
wretches
,
creeping
over
this
*NL*
earth
in
the
shadow
of
an
eternal
wrath
.
It
is
very
terrible
...
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
almost
too
terrible
,
the
picture
of
that
judgement
,
as
it
appears
*NL*
to
me
sometimes
,
at
nights
.
It
is
probably
the
suggestion
of
some
*NL*
picture
that
I
have
seen
somewhere
.
But
upon
an
immense
plain
,
suspended
*NL*
in
mid-air
,
I
seem
to
see
three
figures
,
two
of
them
clasped
close
in
an
*NL*
intense
embrace
,
and
one
intolerably
solitary
.
It
is
in
black
and
white
,
*NL*
my
picture
of
that
judgement
,
an
etching
,
perhaps
;
only
I
can
not
tell
an
*NL*
etching
from
a
photographic
reproduction
.
And
the
immense
plain
is
the
*NL*
hand
of
God
,
stretching
out
for
miles
and
miles
,
with
great
spaces
above
*NL*
it
and
below
it
.
And
they
are
in
the
sight
of
God
,
and
it
is
Florence
*NL*
that
is
alone
...
And
,
do
you
know
,
at
the
thought
of
that
intense
*NL*
solitude
I
feel
an
overwhelming
desire
to
rush
forward
and
comfort
her
.
*NL*
You
can
not
,
you
see
,
have
acted
as
nurse
to
a
person
for
twelve
years
*NL*
without
wishing
to
go
on
nursing
them
,
even
though
you
hate
them
with
*NL*
the
hatred
of
the
adder
,
and
even
in
the
palm
of
God
.
But
,
in
the
*NL*
nights
,
with
that
vision
of
judgement
before
me
,
I
know
that
I
hold
*NL*
myself
back
.
For
I
hate
Florence
.
I
hate
Florence
with
such
a
hatred
*NL*
that
I
would
not
spare
her
an
eternity
of
loneliness
.
She
need
not
have
*NL*
done
what
she
did
.
She
was
an
American
,
a
New
Englander
.
She
had
not
the
*NL*
hot
passions
of
these
Europeans
.
She
cut
out
that
poor
imbecile
of
an
*NL*
Edward
--
and
I
pray
God
that
he
is
really
at
peace
,
clasped
close
in
the
*NL*
arms
of
that
poor
,
poor
girl
!
And
,
no
doubt
,
Maisie
Maidan
will
find
her
*NL*
young
husband
again
,
and
Leonora
will
burn
,
clear
and
serene
,
a
northern
*NL*
light
and
one
of
the
archangels
of
God
.
And
me
...
Well
,
perhaps
,
they
*NL*
will
find
me
an
elevator
to
run
...
But
Florence
...
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
should
not
have
done
it
.
She
should
not
have
done
it
.
It
was
playing
*NL*
it
too
low
down
.
She
cut
out
poor
dear
Edward
from
sheer
vanity
;
*NL*
she
meddled
between
him
and
Leonora
from
a
sheer
,
imbecile
spirit
of
*NL*
district
visiting
.
Do
you
understand
that
,
whilst
she
was
Edward
's
*NL*
mistress
,
she
was
perpetually
trying
to
reunite
him
to
his
wife
?
She
*NL*
would
gabble
on
to
Leonora
about
forgiveness
--
treating
the
subject
from
*NL*
the
bright
,
American
point
of
view
.
And
Leonora
would
treat
her
like
the
*NL*
whore
she
was
.
Once
she
said
to
Florence
in
the
early
morning
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
to
me
straight
out
of
his
bed
to
tell
me
that
that
is
my
*NL*
proper
place
.
I
know
it
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
that
could
not
stop
Florence
.
She
went
on
saying
that
it
was
*NL*
her
ambition
to
leave
this
world
a
little
brighter
by
the
passage
of
her
*NL*
brief
life
,
and
how
thankfully
she
would
leave
Edward
,
whom
she
thought
*NL*
she
had
brought
to
a
right
frame
of
mind
,
if
Leonora
would
only
give
him
*NL*
a
chance
.
He
needed
,
she
said
,
tenderness
beyond
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Leonora
would
answer
--
for
she
put
up
with
this
outrage
for
*NL*
years
--
Leonora
,
as
I
understand
,
would
answer
something
like
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
would
give
him
up
.
And
you
would
go
on
writing
to
each
other
*NL*
in
secret
,
and
committing
adultery
in
hired
rooms
.
I
know
the
pair
*NL*
of
you
,
you
know
.
No
.
I
prefer
the
situation
as
it
is
.
''
Half
the
time
*NL*
Florence
would
ignore
Leonora
's
remarks
.
She
would
think
they
were
not
*NL*
quite
ladylike
.
The
other
half
of
the
time
she
would
try
to
persuade
*NL*
Leonora
that
her
love
for
Edward
was
quite
spiritual
--
on
account
of
her
*NL*
heart
.
Once
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
can
believe
that
of
Maisie
Maidan
,
as
you
say
you
do
,
why
can
not
*NL*
you
believe
it
of
me
?
''
Leonora
was
,
I
understand
,
doing
her
hair
at
*NL*
that
time
in
front
of
the
mirror
in
her
bedroom
.
And
she
looked
round
*NL*
at
Florence
,
to
whom
she
did
not
usually
vouchsafe
a
glance
,
--
she
looked
*NL*
round
coolly
and
calmly
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
do
you
dare
to
mention
Mrs
Maidan
's
name
again
.
You
murdered
her
.
*NL*
You
and
I
murdered
her
between
us
.
I
am
as
much
a
scoundrel
as
you
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
to
be
reminded
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Florence
went
off
at
once
into
a
babble
of
how
could
she
have
hurt
a
*NL*
person
whom
she
hardly
knew
,
a
person
whom
with
the
best
intentions
,
in
*NL*
pursuance
of
her
efforts
to
leave
the
world
a
little
brighter
,
she
had
*NL*
tried
to
save
from
Edward
.
That
was
how
she
figured
it
out
to
herself
.
*NL*
She
really
thought
that
...
So
Leonora
said
patiently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
just
put
it
that
I
killed
her
and
that
it
's
a
painful
*NL*
subject
.
One
does
not
like
to
think
that
one
had
killed
someone
.
*NL*
Naturally
not
.
I
ought
never
to
have
brought
her
from
India
.
''
And
that
,
*NL*
indeed
,
is
exactly
how
Leonora
looked
at
it
.
It
is
stated
a
little
*NL*
baldly
,
but
Leonora
was
always
a
great
one
for
bald
statements
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
happened
on
the
day
of
our
jaunt
to
the
ancient
city
of
M
--
*NL*
had
been
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
,
who
had
been
even
then
filled
with
pity
and
contrition
for
the
*NL*
poor
child
,
on
returning
to
our
hotel
had
gone
straight
to
Mrs
Maidan
's
*NL*
room
.
She
had
wanted
just
to
pet
her
.
And
she
had
perceived
at
first
*NL*
only
,
on
the
clear
,
round
table
covered
with
red
velvet
,
a
letter
*NL*
addressed
to
her
.
It
ran
something
like
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mrs
Ashburnham
,
how
could
you
have
done
it
?
I
trusted
you
so
.
You
*NL*
never
talked
to
me
about
me
and
Edward
,
but
I
trusted
you
.
How
could
you
*NL*
buy
me
from
my
husband
?
I
have
just
heard
how
you
have
--
in
the
hall
they
*NL*
were
talking
about
it
,
Edward
and
the
American
lady
.
You
paid
the
*NL*
money
for
me
to
come
here
.
Oh
,
how
could
you
?
How
could
you
?
I
am
going
*NL*
straight
back
to
Bunny
...
''
Bunny
was
Mrs
Maidan
's
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Leonora
said
that
,
as
she
went
on
reading
the
letter
,
she
had
,
*NL*
without
looking
round
her
,
a
sense
that
that
hotel
room
was
cleared
,
*NL*
that
there
were
no
papers
on
the
table
,
that
there
were
no
clothes
on
*NL*
the
hooks
,
and
that
there
was
a
strained
silence
--
a
silence
,
she
said
,
*NL*
as
if
there
were
something
in
the
room
that
drank
up
such
sounds
as
*NL*
there
were
.
She
had
to
fight
against
that
feeling
,
whilst
she
read
the
*NL*
postscript
of
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
you
wanted
me
for
an
adulteress
,
''
the
postscript
began
.
*NL*
The
poor
child
was
hardly
literate
.
``
It
was
surely
not
right
of
you
and
*NL*
I
never
wanted
to
be
one
.
And
I
heard
Edward
call
me
a
poor
little
rat
*NL*
to
the
American
lady
.
He
always
called
me
a
little
rat
in
private
,
and
*NL*
I
did
not
mind
.
But
,
if
he
called
me
it
to
her
,
I
think
he
does
not
love
*NL*
me
any
more
.
Oh
,
Mrs
Ashburnham
,
you
knew
the
world
and
I
knew
nothing
.
*NL*
I
thought
it
would
be
all
right
if
you
thought
it
could
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
you
would
not
have
brought
me
if
you
did
not
,
too
.
You
should
not
have
*NL*
done
it
,
and
we
out
of
the
same
convent
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
said
that
she
screamed
when
she
read
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
saw
that
Maisie
's
boxes
were
all
packed
,
and
she
began
a
*NL*
search
for
Mrs
Maidan
herself
--
all
over
the
hotel
.
The
manager
said
that
*NL*
Mrs
Maidan
had
paid
her
bill
,
and
had
gone
up
to
the
station
to
ask
the
*NL*
Reiseverkehrsbureau
to
make
her
out
a
plan
for
her
immediate
return
*NL*
to
Chitral
.
He
imagined
that
he
had
seen
her
come
back
,
but
he
was
not
*NL*
quite
certain
.
No
one
in
the
large
hotel
had
bothered
his
head
about
the
*NL*
child
.
And
she
,
wandering
solitarily
in
the
hall
,
had
no
doubt
sat
down
*NL*
beside
a
screen
that
had
Edward
and
Florence
on
the
other
side
.
I
never
*NL*
heard
then
or
after
what
had
passed
between
that
precious
couple
.
I
*NL*
fancy
Florence
was
just
about
beginning
her
cutting
out
of
poor
dear
*NL*
Edward
by
addressing
to
him
some
words
of
friendly
warning
as
to
the
*NL*
ravages
he
might
be
making
in
the
girl
's
heart
.
That
would
be
the
sort
*NL*
of
way
she
would
begin
.
And
Edward
would
have
sentimentally
assured
her
*NL*
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
;
that
Maisie
was
just
a
poor
little
rat
*NL*
whose
passage
to
Nauheim
his
wife
had
paid
out
of
her
own
pocket
.
That
*NL*
would
have
been
enough
to
do
the
trick
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
trick
was
pretty
efficiently
done
.
Leonora
,
with
panic
growing
*NL*
and
with
contrition
very
large
in
her
heart
,
visited
every
one
of
*NL*
the
public
rooms
of
the
hotel
--
the
dining-room
,
the
lounge
,
the
*NL*
schreibzimmer
,
the
winter
garden
.
God
knows
what
they
wanted
with
a
*NL*
winter
garden
in
an
hotel
that
is
only
open
from
May
till
October
.
But
*NL*
there
it
was
.
And
then
Leonora
ran
--
yes
,
she
ran
up
the
stairs
--
to
see
*NL*
if
Maisie
had
not
returned
to
her
rooms
.
She
had
determined
to
take
that
*NL*
child
right
away
from
that
hideous
place
.
It
seemed
to
her
to
be
all
*NL*
unspeakable
.
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
she
was
not
quite
cool
about
it
.
*NL*
Leonora
was
always
Leonora
.
But
the
cold
justice
of
the
thing
demanded
*NL*
that
she
should
play
the
part
of
mother
to
this
child
who
had
come
from
*NL*
the
same
convent
.
She
figured
it
out
to
amount
to
that
.
She
would
leave
*NL*
Edward
to
Florence
and
to
me
--
and
she
would
devote
all
her
time
to
*NL*
providing
that
child
with
an
atmosphere
of
love
until
she
could
be
*NL*
returned
to
her
poor
young
husband
.
It
was
naturally
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
cared
to
look
round
Maisie
's
rooms
at
first
.
Now
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
came
in
,
she
perceived
,
sticking
out
beyond
the
bed
,
a
small
pair
of
*NL*
feet
in
high-heeled
shoes
.
Maisie
had
died
in
the
effort
to
strap
up
a
*NL*
great
portmanteau
.
She
had
died
so
grotesquely
that
her
little
body
had
*NL*
fallen
forward
into
the
trunk
,
and
it
had
closed
upon
her
,
like
the
jaws
*NL*
of
a
gigantic
alligator
.
The
key
was
in
her
hand
.
Her
dark
hair
,
like
*NL*
the
hair
of
a
Japanese
,
had
come
down
and
covered
her
body
and
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
lifted
her
up
--
she
was
the
merest
featherweight
--
and
laid
her
*NL*
on
the
bed
with
her
hair
about
her
.
She
was
smiling
,
as
if
she
had
just
*NL*
scored
a
goal
in
a
hockey
match
.
You
understand
she
had
not
committed
*NL*
suicide
.
Her
heart
had
just
stopped
.
I
saw
her
,
with
the
long
lashes
on
*NL*
the
cheeks
,
with
the
smile
about
the
lips
,
with
the
flowers
all
about
*NL*
her
.
The
stem
of
a
white
lily
rested
in
her
hand
so
that
the
spike
of
*NL*
flowers
was
upon
her
shoulder
.
She
looked
like
a
bride
in
the
sunlight
*NL*
of
the
mortuary
candles
that
were
all
about
her
,
and
the
white
coifs
of
*NL*
the
two
nuns
that
knelt
at
her
feet
with
their
faces
hidden
might
have
*NL*
been
two
swans
that
were
to
bear
her
away
to
kissing-kindness
land
,
or
*NL*
wherever
it
is
.
Leonora
showed
her
to
me
.
She
would
not
let
either
of
*NL*
the
others
see
her
.
She
wanted
,
you
know
,
to
spare
poor
dear
Edward
's
*NL*
feelings
.
He
never
could
bear
the
sight
of
a
corpse
.
And
,
since
she
*NL*
never
gave
him
an
idea
that
Maisie
had
written
to
her
,
he
imagined
that
*NL*
the
death
had
been
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
.
He
soon
got
over
*NL*
it
.
Indeed
,
it
was
the
one
affair
of
his
about
which
he
never
felt
much
*NL*
remorse
.

*NL*
PART
II
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
death
of
Mrs
Maidan
occurred
on
the
4th
of
August
,
1904
.
And
then
*NL*
nothing
happened
until
the
4th
of
August
,
1913
.
There
is
the
curious
*NL*
coincidence
of
dates
,
but
I
do
not
know
whether
that
is
one
of
those
*NL*
sinister
,
as
if
half
jocular
and
altogether
merciless
proceedings
on
the
*NL*
part
of
a
cruel
Providence
that
we
call
a
coincidence
.
Because
it
may
*NL*
just
as
well
have
been
the
superstitious
mind
of
Florence
that
forced
*NL*
her
to
certain
acts
,
as
if
she
had
been
hypnotized
.
It
is
,
however
,
*NL*
certain
that
the
4th
of
August
always
proved
a
significant
date
for
her
.
*NL*
To
begin
with
,
she
was
born
on
the
4th
of
August
.
Then
,
on
that
date
,
in
*NL*
the
year
1899
,
she
set
out
with
her
uncle
for
the
tour
round
the
world
*NL*
in
company
with
a
young
man
called
Jimmy
.
But
that
was
not
merely
a
*NL*
coincidence
.
Her
kindly
old
uncle
,
with
the
supposedly
damaged
heart
,
*NL*
was
in
his
delicate
way
,
offering
her
,
in
this
trip
,
a
birthday
present
*NL*
to
celebrate
her
coming
of
age
.
Then
,
on
the
4th
of
August
,
1900
,
she
*NL*
yielded
to
an
action
that
certainly
coloured
her
whole
life
--
as
well
*NL*
as
mine
.
She
had
no
luck
.
She
was
probably
offering
herself
a
birthday
*NL*
present
that
morning
...
On
the
4th
of
August
,
1901
,
she
married
me
,
and
*NL*
set
sail
for
Europe
in
a
great
gale
of
wind
--
the
gale
that
affected
her
*NL*
heart
.
And
no
doubt
there
,
again
,
she
was
offering
herself
a
birthday
*NL*
gift
--
the
birthday
gift
of
my
miserable
life
.
It
occurs
to
me
that
I
*NL*
have
never
told
you
anything
about
my
marriage
.
That
was
like
this
:
*NL*
I
have
told
you
,
as
I
think
,
that
I
first
met
Florence
at
the
*NL*
Stuyvesants
'
,
in
Fourteenth
Street
.
And
,
from
that
moment
,
I
determined
*NL*
with
all
the
obstinacy
of
a
possibly
weak
nature
,
if
not
to
make
her
*NL*
mine
,
at
least
to
marry
her
.
I
had
no
occupation
--
I
had
no
business
*NL*
affairs
.
I
simply
camped
down
there
in
Stamford
,
in
a
vile
hotel
,
and
*NL*
just
passed
my
days
in
the
house
,
or
on
the
verandah
of
the
Misses
*NL*
Hurlbird
.
The
Misses
Hurlbird
,
in
an
odd
,
obstinate
way
,
did
not
like
*NL*
my
presence
.
But
they
were
hampered
by
the
national
manners
of
these
*NL*
occasions
.
Florence
had
her
own
sitting-room
.
She
could
ask
to
it
whom
*NL*
she
liked
,
and
I
simply
walked
into
that
apartment
.
I
was
as
timid
as
*NL*
you
will
,
but
in
that
matter
I
was
like
a
chicken
that
is
determined
*NL*
to
get
across
the
road
in
front
of
an
automobile
.
I
would
walk
into
*NL*
Florence
's
pretty
,
little
,
old-fashioned
room
,
take
off
my
hat
,
and
sit
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Florence
had
,
of
course
,
several
other
fellows
,
too
--
strapping
young
*NL*
New
Englanders
,
who
worked
during
the
day
in
New
York
and
spent
only
the
*NL*
evenings
in
the
village
of
their
birth
.
And
,
in
the
evenings
,
they
*NL*
would
march
in
on
Florence
with
almost
as
much
determination
as
I
myself
*NL*
showed
.
And
I
am
bound
to
say
that
they
were
received
with
as
much
*NL*
disfavour
as
was
my
portion
--
from
the
Misses
Hurlbird
...
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
curious
old
creatures
,
those
two
.
It
was
almost
as
if
they
*NL*
were
members
of
an
ancient
family
under
some
curse
--
they
were
so
*NL*
gentlewomanly
,
so
proper
,
and
they
sighed
so
.
Sometimes
I
would
see
*NL*
tears
in
their
eyes
.
I
do
not
know
that
my
courtship
of
Florence
made
*NL*
much
progress
at
first
.
Perhaps
that
was
because
it
took
place
almost
*NL*
entirely
during
the
daytime
,
on
hot
afternoons
,
when
the
clouds
of
dust
*NL*
hung
like
fog
,
right
up
as
high
as
the
tops
of
the
thin-leaved
elms
.
The
*NL*
night
,
I
believe
,
is
the
proper
season
for
the
gentle
feats
of
love
,
not
*NL*
a
Connecticut
July
afternoon
,
when
any
sort
of
proximity
is
an
almost
*NL*
appalling
thought
.
But
,
if
I
never
so
much
as
kissed
Florence
,
she
let
*NL*
me
discover
very
easily
,
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
,
her
simple
wants
.
*NL*
And
I
could
supply
those
wants
...
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
marry
a
gentleman
of
leisure
;
she
wanted
a
European
*NL*
establishment
.
She
wanted
her
husband
to
have
an
English
accent
,
*NL*
an
income
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
year
from
real
estate
and
no
*NL*
ambitions
to
increase
that
income
.
And
--
she
faintly
hinted
--
she
did
*NL*
not
want
much
physical
passion
in
the
affair
.
Americans
,
you
know
,
can
*NL*
envisage
such
unions
without
blinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
cut
this
information
in
floods
of
bright
talk
--
she
would
pop
a
*NL*
little
bit
of
it
into
comments
over
a
view
of
the
Rialto
,
Venice
,
and
,
*NL*
whilst
she
was
brightly
describing
Balmoral
Castle
,
she
would
say
that
*NL*
her
ideal
husband
would
he
one
who
could
get
her
received
at
the
British
*NL*
Court
.
She
had
spent
,
it
seemed
,
two
months
in
Great
Britain
--
seven
*NL*
weeks
in
touring
from
Stratford
to
Strathpeffer
,
and
one
as
paying
*NL*
guest
in
an
old
English
family
near
Ledbury
,
an
impoverished
,
but
still
*NL*
stately
family
,
called
Bagshawe
.
They
were
to
have
spent
two
months
*NL*
more
in
that
tranquil
bosom
,
but
inopportune
events
,
apparently
in
her
*NL*
uncle
's
business
,
had
caused
their
rather
hurried
return
to
Stamford
.
*NL*
The
young
man
called
Jimmy
had
remained
in
Europe
to
perfect
his
*NL*
knowledge
of
that
continent
.
He
certainly
did
:
he
was
most
useful
to
us
*NL*
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
point
that
came
out
--
that
there
was
no
mistaking
--
was
that
*NL*
Florence
was
coldly
and
calmly
determined
to
take
no
look
at
any
man
who
*NL*
could
not
give
her
a
European
settlement
.
Her
glimpse
of
English
home
*NL*
life
had
effected
this
.
She
meant
,
on
her
marriage
,
to
have
a
year
*NL*
in
Paris
,
and
then
to
have
her
husband
buy
some
real
estate
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
Fordingbridge
,
from
which
place
the
Hurlbirds
had
come
*NL*
in
the
year
1688
.
On
the
strength
of
that
she
was
going
to
take
her
*NL*
place
in
the
ranks
of
English
county
society
.
That
was
fixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
used
to
feel
mightily
elevated
when
I
considered
these
details
,
for
*NL*
I
could
not
figure
out
that
amongst
her
acquaintances
in
Stamford
there
*NL*
was
any
fellow
that
would
fill
the
bill
.
The
most
of
them
were
not
*NL*
as
wealthy
as
I
,
and
those
that
were
were
not
the
type
to
give
up
the
*NL*
fascinations
of
Wall
Street
even
for
the
protracted
companionship
of
*NL*
Florence
.
But
nothing
really
happened
during
the
month
of
July
.
On
the
*NL*
1st
of
August
Florence
apparently
told
her
aunts
that
she
intended
to
*NL*
marry
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
told
me
so
,
but
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
aunts
,
for
,
on
*NL*
that
afternoon
,
Miss
Florence
Hurlbird
,
Senior
,
stopped
me
on
my
way
to
*NL*
Florence
's
sitting-room
and
took
me
,
agitatedly
,
into
the
parlour
.
It
*NL*
was
a
singular
interview
,
in
that
old-fashioned
colonial
room
,
with
the
*NL*
spindle-legged
furniture
,
the
silhouettes
,
the
miniatures
,
the
portrait
*NL*
of
General
Braddock
,
and
the
smell
of
lavender
.
You
see
,
the
two
poor
*NL*
maiden
ladies
were
in
agonies
--
and
they
could
not
say
one
single
thing
*NL*
direct
.
They
would
almost
wring
their
hands
and
ask
if
I
had
considered
*NL*
such
a
thing
as
different
temperaments
.
I
assure
you
they
were
almost
*NL*
affectionate
,
concerned
for
me
even
,
as
if
Florence
were
too
bright
for
*NL*
my
solid
and
serious
virtues
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
they
had
discovered
in
me
solid
and
serious
virtues
.
That
might
*NL*
have
been
because
I
had
once
dropped
the
remark
that
I
preferred
General
*NL*
Braddock
to
General
Washington
.
For
the
Hurlbirds
had
backed
the
losing
*NL*
side
in
the
War
of
Independence
,
and
had
been
seriously
impoverished
and
*NL*
quite
efficiently
oppressed
for
that
reason
.
The
Misses
Hurlbird
could
*NL*
never
forget
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
they
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
a
European
career
for
*NL*
myself
and
Florence
.
Each
of
them
really
wailed
when
they
heard
that
*NL*
that
was
what
I
hoped
to
give
their
niece
.
That
may
have
been
partly
*NL*
because
they
regarded
Europe
as
a
sink
of
iniquity
,
where
strange
*NL*
laxities
prevailed
.
They
thought
the
Mother
Country
as
Erastian
as
any
*NL*
other
.
And
they
carried
their
protests
to
extraordinary
lengths
,
for
*NL*
them
...
*NL*
*NL*
They
even
,
almost
,
said
that
marriage
was
a
sacrament
;
but
neither
Miss
*NL*
Florence
nor
Miss
Emily
could
quite
bring
herself
to
utter
the
word
.
*NL*
And
they
almost
brought
themselves
to
say
that
Florence
's
early
life
had
*NL*
been
characterized
by
flirtations
--
something
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
I
ended
the
interview
by
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
.
If
Florence
has
robbed
a
bank
I
am
going
to
marry
her
and
*NL*
take
her
to
Europe
.
''
And
at
that
Miss
Emily
wailed
and
fainted
.
But
Miss
*NL*
Florence
,
in
spite
of
the
state
of
her
sister
,
threw
herself
on
my
neck
*NL*
and
cried
out
:
``
Do
n't
do
it
,
John
.
Do
n't
do
it
.
You
're
a
good
young
*NL*
man
,
''
and
she
added
,
whilst
I
was
getting
out
of
the
room
to
send
*NL*
Florence
to
her
aunt
's
rescue
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ought
to
tell
you
more
.
But
she
's
our
dear
sister
's
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Florence
,
I
remember
,
received
me
with
a
chalk-pale
face
and
the
*NL*
exclamation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
those
old
cats
been
saying
anything
against
me
?
''
But
I
assured
*NL*
her
that
they
had
not
and
hurried
her
into
the
room
of
her
strangely
*NL*
afflicted
relatives
.
I
had
really
forgotten
all
about
that
exclamation
*NL*
of
Florence
's
until
this
moment
.
She
treated
me
so
very
well
--
with
such
*NL*
tact
--
that
,
if
I
ever
thought
of
it
afterwards
I
put
it
down
to
her
deep
*NL*
affection
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
evening
,
when
I
went
to
fetch
her
for
a
buggy-ride
,
she
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
I
did
not
lose
any
time
.
I
went
into
New
York
and
engaged
*NL*
berths
on
the
``
Pocahontas
''
,
that
was
to
sail
on
the
evening
of
the
*NL*
fourth
of
the
month
,
and
then
,
returning
to
Stamford
,
I
tracked
out
,
in
*NL*
the
course
of
the
day
,
that
Florence
had
been
driven
to
Rye
Station
.
*NL*
And
there
I
found
that
she
had
taken
the
cars
to
Waterbury
.
She
had
,
of
*NL*
course
,
gone
to
her
uncle
's
.
The
old
man
received
me
with
a
stony
,
husky
*NL*
face
.
I
was
not
to
see
Florence
;
she
was
ill
;
she
was
keeping
her
room
.
*NL*
And
,
from
something
that
he
let
drop
--
an
odd
Biblical
phrase
that
I
have
*NL*
forgotten
--
I
gathered
that
all
that
family
simply
did
not
intend
her
to
*NL*
marry
ever
in
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
procured
at
once
the
name
of
the
nearest
minister
and
a
rope
*NL*
ladder
--
you
have
no
idea
how
primitively
these
matters
were
arranged
in
*NL*
those
days
in
the
United
States
.
I
daresay
that
may
be
so
still
.
And
*NL*
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
of
the
4th
of
August
I
was
standing
in
*NL*
Florence
's
bedroom
.
I
was
so
one-minded
in
my
purpose
that
it
never
*NL*
struck
me
there
was
anything
improper
in
being
,
at
one
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
in
Florence
's
bedroom
.
I
just
wanted
to
wake
her
up
.
She
was
*NL*
not
,
however
,
asleep
.
She
expected
me
,
and
her
relatives
had
only
just
*NL*
left
her
.
She
received
me
with
an
embrace
of
a
warmth
...
Well
,
it
was
*NL*
the
first
time
I
had
ever
been
embraced
by
a
woman
--
and
it
was
the
last
*NL*
when
a
woman
's
embrace
has
had
in
it
any
warmth
for
me
...
I
suppose
it
*NL*
was
my
own
fault
,
what
followed
.
At
any
rate
,
I
was
in
such
a
hurry
*NL*
to
get
the
wedding
over
,
and
was
so
afraid
of
her
relatives
finding
me
*NL*
there
,
that
I
must
have
received
her
advances
with
a
certain
amount
of
*NL*
absence
of
mind
.
I
was
out
of
that
room
and
down
the
ladder
in
under
*NL*
half
a
minute
.
She
kept
me
waiting
at
the
foot
an
unconscionable
*NL*
time
--
it
was
certainly
three
in
the
morning
before
we
knocked
up
that
*NL*
minister
.
And
I
think
that
that
wait
was
the
only
sign
Florence
ever
*NL*
showed
of
having
a
conscience
as
far
as
I
was
concerned
,
unless
her
*NL*
lying
for
some
moments
in
my
arms
was
also
a
sign
of
conscience
.
I
fancy
*NL*
that
,
if
I
had
shown
warmth
then
,
she
would
have
acted
the
proper
wife
*NL*
to
me
,
or
would
have
put
me
back
again
.
But
,
because
I
acted
like
a
*NL*
Philadelphia
gentleman
,
she
made
me
,
I
suppose
,
go
through
with
the
part
*NL*
of
a
male
nurse
.
Perhaps
she
thought
that
I
should
not
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
as
I
gather
,
she
had
not
any
more
remorse
.
She
was
only
*NL*
anxious
to
carry
out
her
plans
.
For
,
just
before
she
came
down
the
*NL*
ladder
,
she
called
me
to
the
top
of
that
grotesque
implement
that
I
went
*NL*
up
and
down
like
a
tranquil
jumping-jack
.
I
was
perfectly
collected
.
She
*NL*
said
to
me
with
a
certain
fierceness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
determined
that
we
sail
at
four
this
afternoon
?
You
are
not
lying
*NL*
about
having
taken
berths
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
understood
that
she
would
naturally
be
anxious
to
get
away
from
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
her
apparently
insane
relatives
,
so
that
I
readily
*NL*
excused
her
for
thinking
that
I
should
be
capable
of
lying
about
such
*NL*
a
thing
.
I
made
it
,
therefore
,
plain
to
her
that
it
was
my
fixed
*NL*
determination
to
sail
by
the
``
Pocahontas
''
.
She
said
then
--
it
was
a
*NL*
moonlit
morning
,
and
she
was
whispering
in
my
ear
whilst
I
stood
on
*NL*
the
ladder
.
The
hills
that
surround
Waterbury
showed
,
extraordinarily
*NL*
tranquil
,
around
the
villa
.
She
said
,
almost
coldly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
know
,
so
as
to
pack
my
trunks
.
''
And
she
added
:
``
I
may
be
*NL*
ill
,
you
know
.
I
guess
my
heart
is
a
little
like
Uncle
Hurlbird
's
.
It
*NL*
runs
in
families
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
whispered
that
the
``
Pocahontas
''
was
an
extraordinarily
steady
boat
...
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
wonder
what
had
passed
through
Florence
's
mind
during
the
two
*NL*
hours
that
she
had
kept
me
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
.
I
would
*NL*
give
not
a
little
to
know
.
Till
then
,
I
fancy
she
had
had
no
settled
*NL*
plan
in
her
mind
.
She
certainly
never
mentioned
her
heart
till
that
*NL*
time
.
Perhaps
the
renewed
sight
of
her
Uncle
Hurlbird
had
given
her
the
*NL*
idea
.
Certainly
her
Aunt
Emily
,
who
had
come
over
with
her
to
Waterbury
,
*NL*
would
have
rubbed
into
her
,
for
hours
and
hours
,
the
idea
that
any
*NL*
accentuated
discussions
would
kill
the
old
gentleman
.
That
would
recall
*NL*
to
her
mind
all
the
safeguards
against
excitement
with
which
the
poor
*NL*
silly
old
gentleman
had
been
hedged
in
during
their
trip
round
the
*NL*
world
.
That
,
perhaps
,
put
it
into
her
head
.
Still
,
I
believe
there
was
*NL*
some
remorse
on
my
account
,
too
.
Leonora
told
me
that
Florence
said
*NL*
there
was
--
for
Leonora
knew
all
about
it
,
and
once
went
so
far
as
to
*NL*
ask
her
how
she
could
do
a
thing
so
infamous
.
She
excused
herself
on
*NL*
the
score
of
an
overmastering
passion
.
Well
,
I
always
say
that
an
*NL*
overmastering
passion
is
a
good
excuse
for
feelings
.
You
can
not
help
*NL*
them
.
And
it
is
a
good
excuse
for
straight
actions
--
she
might
have
*NL*
bolted
with
the
fellow
,
before
or
after
she
married
me
.
And
,
if
they
had
*NL*
not
enough
money
to
get
along
with
,
they
might
have
cut
their
throats
,
*NL*
or
sponged
on
her
family
,
though
,
of
course
,
Florence
wanted
such
a
lot
*NL*
that
it
would
have
suited
her
very
badly
to
have
for
a
husband
a
clerk
*NL*
in
a
dry-goods
store
,
which
was
what
old
Hurlbird
would
have
made
of
*NL*
that
fellow
.
He
hated
him
.
No
,
I
do
not
think
that
there
is
much
excuse
*NL*
for
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
God
knows
.
She
was
a
frightened
fool
,
and
she
was
fantastic
,
and
I
*NL*
suppose
that
,
at
that
time
,
she
really
cared
for
that
imbecile
.
He
*NL*
certainly
did
n't
care
for
her
.
Poor
thing
...
At
any
rate
,
after
I
had
*NL*
assured
her
that
the
``
Pocahontas
''
was
a
steady
ship
,
she
just
said
:
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
look
after
me
in
certain
ways
--
like
Uncle
Hurlbird
is
*NL*
looked
after
.
I
will
tell
you
how
to
do
it
.
''
And
then
she
stepped
over
*NL*
the
sill
,
as
if
she
were
stepping
on
board
a
boat
.
I
suppose
she
had
*NL*
burnt
hers
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
,
no
doubt
,
eye-openers
enough
.
When
we
re-entered
the
Hurlbird
*NL*
mansion
at
eight
o'clock
the
Hurlbirds
were
just
exhausted
.
Florence
had
*NL*
a
hard
,
triumphant
air
.
We
had
got
married
about
four
in
the
morning
*NL*
and
had
sat
about
in
the
woods
above
the
town
till
then
,
listening
to
a
*NL*
mocking-bird
imitate
an
old
tom-cat
.
So
I
guess
Florence
had
not
found
*NL*
getting
married
to
me
a
very
stimulating
process
.
I
had
not
found
*NL*
anything
much
more
inspiring
to
say
than
how
glad
I
was
,
with
*NL*
variations
.
I
think
I
was
too
dazed
.
Well
,
the
Hurlbirds
were
too
dazed
*NL*
to
say
much
.
We
had
breakfast
together
,
and
then
Florence
went
to
pack
*NL*
her
grips
and
things
.
Old
Hurlbird
took
the
opportunity
to
read
me
a
*NL*
full-blooded
lecture
,
in
the
style
of
an
American
oration
,
as
to
the
*NL*
perils
for
young
American
girlhood
lurking
in
the
European
jungle
.
He
*NL*
said
that
Paris
was
full
of
snakes
in
the
grass
,
of
which
he
had
had
*NL*
bitter
experience
.
He
concluded
,
as
they
always
do
,
poor
,
dear
old
*NL*
things
,
with
the
aspiration
that
all
American
women
should
one
day
be
*NL*
sexless
--
though
that
is
not
the
way
they
put
it
.
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
we
made
the
ship
all
right
by
one-thirty
--
an
there
was
a
tempest
*NL*
blowing
.
That
helped
Florence
a
good
deal
.
For
we
were
not
ten
minutes
*NL*
out
from
Sandy
Hook
before
Florence
went
down
into
her
cabin
and
her
*NL*
heart
took
her
.
An
agitated
stewardess
came
running
up
to
me
,
and
I
went
*NL*
running
down
.
I
got
my
directions
how
to
behave
to
my
wife
.
Most
of
them
*NL*
came
from
her
,
though
it
was
the
ship
doctor
who
discreetly
suggested
*NL*
to
me
that
I
had
better
refrain
from
manifestations
of
affection
.
I
was
*NL*
ready
enough
.
I
was
,
of
course
,
full
of
remorse
.
It
occurred
to
me
that
*NL*
her
heart
was
the
reason
for
the
Hurlbirds
'
mysterious
desire
to
keep
*NL*
their
youngest
and
dearest
unmarried
.
Of
course
,
they
would
be
*NL*
too
refined
to
put
the
motive
into
words
.
They
were
old
stock
New
*NL*
Englanders
.
They
would
not
want
to
have
to
suggest
that
a
husband
must
*NL*
not
kiss
the
back
of
his
wife
's
neck
.
They
would
not
like
to
suggest
*NL*
that
he
might
,
for
the
matter
of
that
.
I
wonder
,
though
,
how
Florence
*NL*
got
the
doctor
to
enter
the
conspiracy
--
the
several
doctors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
her
heart
squeaked
a
bit
--
she
had
the
same
configuration
of
*NL*
the
lungs
as
her
Uncle
Hurlbird
.
And
,
in
his
company
,
she
must
have
*NL*
heard
a
great
deal
of
heart
talk
from
specialists
.
Anyhow
,
she
and
they
*NL*
tied
me
pretty
well
down
--
and
Jimmy
,
of
course
,
that
dreary
boy
--
what
in
*NL*
the
world
did
she
see
in
him
?
He
was
lugubrious
,
silent
,
morose
.
He
had
*NL*
no
talent
as
a
painter
.
He
was
very
sallow
and
dark
,
and
he
never
shaved
*NL*
sufficiently
.
He
met
us
at
Havre
,
and
he
proceeded
to
make
himself
*NL*
useful
for
the
next
two
years
,
during
which
he
lived
in
our
flat
in
*NL*
Paris
,
whether
we
were
there
or
not
.
He
studied
painting
at
Julien
's
,
or
*NL*
some
such
place
...
*NL*
*NL*
That
fellow
had
his
hands
always
in
the
pockets
of
his
odious
,
*NL*
square-shouldered
,
broad-hipped
,
American
coats
,
and
his
dark
eyes
were
*NL*
always
full
of
ominous
appearances
.
He
was
,
besides
,
too
fat
.
Why
,
I
was
*NL*
much
the
better
man
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
daresay
Florence
would
have
given
me
the
better
.
She
showed
signs
*NL*
of
it
.
I
think
,
perhaps
,
the
enigmatic
smile
with
which
she
used
to
look
*NL*
back
at
me
over
her
shoulder
when
she
went
into
the
bathing
place
was
a
*NL*
sort
of
invitation
.
I
have
mentioned
that
.
It
was
as
if
she
were
saying
:
*NL*
``
I
am
going
in
here
.
I
am
going
to
stand
so
stripped
and
white
and
*NL*
straight
--
and
you
are
a
man
...
''
Perhaps
it
was
that
...
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
she
can
not
have
liked
that
fellow
long
.
He
looked
like
sallow
putty
.
*NL*
I
understand
that
he
had
been
slim
and
dark
and
very
graceful
at
*NL*
the
time
of
her
first
disgrace
.
But
,
loafing
about
in
Paris
,
on
her
*NL*
pocket-money
and
on
the
allowance
that
old
Hurlbird
made
him
to
keep
out
*NL*
of
the
United
States
,
had
given
him
a
stomach
like
a
man
of
forty
,
and
*NL*
dyspeptic
irritation
on
top
of
it
.
God
,
how
they
worked
me
!
It
was
*NL*
those
two
between
them
who
really
elaborated
the
rules
.
I
have
told
you
*NL*
something
about
them
--
how
I
had
to
head
conversations
,
for
all
those
*NL*
eleven
years
,
off
such
topics
as
love
,
poverty
,
crime
,
and
so
on
.
But
,
*NL*
looking
over
what
I
have
written
,
I
see
that
I
have
unintentionally
*NL*
misled
you
when
I
said
that
Florence
was
never
out
of
my
sight
.
Yet
*NL*
that
was
the
impression
that
I
really
had
until
just
now
.
When
I
come
to
*NL*
think
of
it
she
was
out
of
my
sight
most
of
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
that
fellow
impressed
upon
me
that
what
Florence
needed
most
*NL*
of
all
were
sleep
and
privacy
.
I
must
never
enter
her
room
without
*NL*
knocking
,
or
her
poor
little
heart
might
flutter
away
to
its
doom
.
He
*NL*
said
these
things
with
his
lugubrious
croak
,
and
his
black
eyes
like
*NL*
a
crow
's
,
so
that
I
seemed
to
see
poor
Florence
die
ten
times
a
day
--
a
*NL*
little
,
pale
,
frail
corpse
.
Why
,
I
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
*NL*
entering
her
room
without
her
permission
as
of
burgling
a
church
.
I
*NL*
would
sooner
have
committed
that
crime
.
I
would
certainly
have
done
it
*NL*
if
I
had
thought
the
state
of
her
heart
demanded
the
sacrilege
.
So
at
*NL*
ten
o'clock
at
night
the
door
closed
upon
Florence
,
who
had
gently
,
*NL*
and
,
as
if
reluctantly
,
backed
up
that
fellow
's
recommendations
;
and
*NL*
she
would
wish
me
good
night
as
if
she
were
a
cinquecento
Italian
lady
*NL*
saying
good-bye
to
her
lover
.
And
at
ten
o'clock
of
the
next
morning
*NL*
there
she
would
come
out
the
door
of
her
room
as
fresh
as
Venus
rising
*NL*
from
any
of
the
couches
that
are
mentioned
in
Greek
legends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
room
door
was
locked
because
she
was
nervous
about
thieves
;
but
*NL*
an
electric
contrivance
on
a
cord
was
understood
to
be
attached
to
her
*NL*
little
wrist
.
She
had
only
to
press
a
bulb
to
raise
the
house
.
And
I
was
*NL*
provided
with
an
axe
--
an
axe
!
--
great
gods
,
with
which
to
break
down
her
*NL*
door
in
case
she
ever
failed
to
answer
my
knock
,
after
I
knocked
really
*NL*
loud
several
times
.
It
was
pretty
well
thought
out
,
you
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
n't
so
well
thought
out
were
the
ultimate
consequences
--
our
*NL*
being
tied
to
Europe
.
For
that
young
man
rubbed
it
so
well
into
me
that
*NL*
Florence
would
die
if
she
crossed
the
Channel
--
he
impressed
it
so
fully
*NL*
on
my
mind
that
,
when
later
Florence
wanted
to
go
to
Fordingbridge
,
I
*NL*
cut
the
proposal
short
--
absolutely
short
,
with
a
curt
no
.
It
fixed
her
*NL*
and
it
frightened
her
.
I
was
even
backed
up
by
all
the
doctors
.
I
seemed
*NL*
to
have
had
endless
interviews
with
doctor
after
doctor
,
cool
,
quiet
*NL*
men
,
who
would
ask
,
in
reasonable
tones
,
whether
there
was
any
reason
*NL*
for
our
going
to
England
--
any
special
reason
.
And
since
I
could
not
see
*NL*
any
special
reason
,
they
would
give
the
verdict
:
``
Better
not
,
then
.
''
I
*NL*
daresay
they
were
honest
enough
,
as
things
go
.
They
probably
imagined
*NL*
that
the
mere
associations
of
the
steamer
might
have
effects
on
*NL*
Florence
's
nerves
.
That
would
be
enough
,
that
and
a
conscientious
desire
*NL*
to
keep
our
money
on
the
Continent
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
have
rattled
poor
Florence
pretty
considerably
,
for
you
see
,
the
*NL*
main
idea
--
the
only
main
idea
of
her
heart
,
that
was
otherwise
cold
--
was
*NL*
to
get
to
Fordingbridge
and
be
a
county
lady
in
the
home
of
her
*NL*
ancestors
.
But
Jimmy
got
her
,
there
:
he
shut
on
her
the
door
of
the
*NL*
Channel
;
even
on
the
fairest
day
of
blue
sky
,
with
the
cliffs
of
England
*NL*
shining
like
mother
of
pearl
in
full
view
of
Calais
,
I
would
not
have
*NL*
let
her
cross
the
steamer
gangway
to
save
her
life
.
I
tell
you
it
fixed
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
fixed
her
beautifully
,
because
she
could
not
announce
herself
*NL*
as
cured
,
since
that
would
have
put
an
end
to
the
locked
bedroom
*NL*
arrangements
.
And
,
by
the
time
she
was
sick
of
Jimmy
--
which
happened
in
*NL*
the
year
1903
--
she
had
taken
on
Edward
Ashburnham
.
Yes
,
it
was
a
bad
*NL*
fix
for
her
,
because
Edward
could
have
taken
her
to
Fordingbridge
,
and
,
*NL*
though
he
could
not
give
her
Branshaw
Manor
,
that
home
of
her
ancestors
*NL*
being
settled
on
his
wife
,
she
could
at
least
have
pretty
considerably
*NL*
queened
it
there
or
thereabouts
,
what
with
our
money
and
the
support
of
*NL*
the
Ashburnhams
.
Her
uncle
,
as
soon
as
he
considered
that
she
had
really
*NL*
settled
down
with
me
--
and
I
sent
him
only
the
most
glowing
accounts
of
*NL*
her
virtue
and
constancy
--
made
over
to
her
a
very
considerable
part
of
*NL*
his
fortune
for
which
he
had
no
use
.
I
suppose
that
we
had
,
between
us
,
*NL*
fifteen
thousand
a
year
in
English
money
,
though
I
never
quite
knew
*NL*
how
much
of
hers
went
to
Jimmy
.
At
any
rate
,
we
could
have
shone
in
*NL*
Fordingbridge
.
I
never
quite
knew
,
either
,
how
she
and
Edward
got
rid
*NL*
of
Jimmy
.
I
fancy
that
fat
and
disreputable
raven
must
have
had
his
six
*NL*
golden
front
teeth
knocked
down
his
throat
by
Edward
one
morning
whilst
*NL*
I
had
gone
out
to
buy
some
flowers
in
the
Rue
de
la
Paix
,
leaving
*NL*
Florence
and
the
flat
in
charge
of
those
two
.
And
serve
him
very
right
,
*NL*
is
all
that
I
can
say
.
He
was
a
bad
sort
of
blackmailer
;
I
hope
Florence
*NL*
does
not
have
his
company
in
the
next
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
God
is
my
Judge
,
I
do
not
believe
that
I
would
have
separated
those
*NL*
two
if
I
had
known
that
they
really
and
passionately
loved
each
other
.
*NL*
I
do
not
know
where
the
public
morality
of
the
case
comes
in
,
and
,
of
*NL*
course
,
no
man
really
knows
what
he
would
have
done
in
any
given
case
.
*NL*
But
I
truly
believe
that
I
would
have
united
them
,
observing
ways
and
*NL*
means
as
decent
as
I
could
.
I
believe
that
I
should
have
given
them
*NL*
money
to
live
upon
and
that
I
should
have
consoled
myself
somehow
.
At
*NL*
that
date
I
might
have
found
some
young
thing
,
like
Maisie
Maidan
,
or
*NL*
the
poor
girl
,
and
I
might
have
had
some
peace
.
For
peace
I
never
had
*NL*
with
Florence
,
and
hardly
believe
that
I
cared
for
her
in
the
way
of
*NL*
love
after
a
year
or
two
of
it
.
She
became
for
me
a
rare
and
fragile
*NL*
object
,
something
burdensome
,
but
very
frail
.
Why
it
was
as
if
I
*NL*
had
been
given
a
thin-shelled
pullet
's
egg
to
carry
on
my
palm
from
*NL*
Equatorial
Africa
to
Hoboken
.
Yes
,
she
became
for
me
,
as
it
were
,
the
*NL*
subject
of
a
bet
--
the
trophy
of
an
athlete
's
achievement
,
a
parsley
*NL*
crown
that
is
the
symbol
of
his
chastity
,
his
soberness
,
his
*NL*
abstentions
,
and
of
his
inflexible
will
.
Of
intrinsic
value
as
a
wife
,
*NL*
I
think
she
had
none
at
all
for
me
.
I
fancy
I
was
not
even
proud
of
the
*NL*
way
she
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
passion
for
Jimmy
was
not
even
a
passion
,
and
,
mad
as
the
*NL*
suggestion
may
appear
,
she
was
frightened
for
her
life
.
Yes
,
she
was
*NL*
afraid
of
me
.
I
will
tell
you
how
that
happened
.
I
had
,
in
the
old
days
,
*NL*
a
darky
servant
,
called
Julius
,
who
valeted
me
,
and
waited
on
me
,
and
*NL*
loved
me
,
like
the
crown
of
his
head
.
Now
,
when
we
left
Waterbury
to
go
*NL*
to
the
``
Pocahontas
''
,
Florence
entrusted
to
me
one
very
special
and
very
*NL*
precious
leather
grip
.
She
told
me
that
her
life
might
depend
on
that
*NL*
grip
,
which
contained
her
drugs
against
heart
attacks
.
And
,
since
I
was
*NL*
never
much
of
a
hand
at
carrying
things
,
I
entrusted
this
,
in
turn
,
to
*NL*
Julius
,
who
was
a
grey-haired
chap
of
sixty
or
so
,
and
very
picturesque
*NL*
at
that
.
He
made
so
much
impression
on
Florence
that
she
regarded
him
as
*NL*
a
sort
of
father
,
and
absolutely
refused
to
let
me
take
him
to
Paris
.
He
*NL*
would
have
inconvenienced
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
Julius
was
so
overcome
with
grief
at
being
left
behind
that
he
*NL*
must
needs
go
and
drop
the
precious
grip
.
I
saw
red
,
I
saw
purple
.
I
*NL*
flew
at
Julius
.
On
the
ferry
,
it
was
,
I
filled
up
one
of
his
eyes
;
I
*NL*
threatened
to
strangle
him
.
And
,
since
an
unresisting
negro
can
make
*NL*
a
deplorable
noise
and
a
deplorable
spectacle
,
and
,
since
that
was
*NL*
Florence
's
first
adventure
in
the
married
state
,
she
got
a
pretty
idea
*NL*
of
my
character
.
It
affirmed
in
her
the
desperate
resolve
to
conceal
*NL*
from
me
the
fact
that
she
was
not
what
she
would
have
called
``
a
pure
*NL*
woman
''
.
For
that
was
really
the
mainspring
of
her
fantastic
actions
.
She
*NL*
was
afraid
that
I
should
murder
her
...
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
got
up
the
heart
attack
,
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
,
on
*NL*
board
the
liner
.
Perhaps
she
was
not
so
very
much
to
be
blamed
.
You
must
*NL*
remember
that
she
was
a
New
Englander
,
and
that
New
England
had
not
yet
*NL*
come
to
loathe
darkies
as
it
does
now
.
Whereas
,
if
she
had
come
from
*NL*
even
so
little
south
as
Philadelphia
,
and
had
been
an
oldish
family
,
she
*NL*
would
have
seen
that
for
me
to
kick
Julius
was
not
so
outrageous
an
act
*NL*
as
for
her
cousin
,
Reggie
Hurlbird
,
to
say
--
as
I
have
heard
him
say
to
*NL*
his
English
butler
--
that
for
two
cents
he
would
bat
him
on
the
pants
.
*NL*
Besides
,
the
medicine-grip
did
not
bulk
as
largely
in
her
eyes
as
it
did
*NL*
in
mine
,
where
it
was
the
symbol
of
the
existence
of
an
adored
wife
of
a
*NL*
day
.
To
her
it
was
just
a
useful
lie
...
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
there
you
have
the
position
,
as
clear
as
I
can
make
it
--
the
*NL*
husband
an
ignorant
fool
,
the
wife
a
cold
sensualist
with
imbecile
*NL*
fears
--
for
I
was
such
a
fool
that
I
should
never
have
known
what
she
was
*NL*
or
was
not
--
and
the
blackmailing
lover
.
And
then
the
other
lover
came
*NL*
along
...
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
Edward
Ashburnham
was
worth
having
.
Have
I
conveyed
to
you
the
*NL*
splendid
fellow
that
he
was
--
the
fine
soldier
,
the
excellent
landlord
,
*NL*
the
extraordinarily
kind
,
careful
and
industrious
magistrate
,
the
*NL*
upright
,
honest
,
fair-dealing
,
fair-thinking
,
public
character
?
I
*NL*
suppose
I
have
not
conveyed
it
to
you
.
The
truth
is
,
that
I
never
*NL*
knew
it
until
the
poor
girl
came
along
--
the
poor
girl
who
was
just
as
*NL*
straight
,
as
splendid
and
as
upright
as
he
.
I
swear
she
was
.
I
suppose
*NL*
I
ought
to
have
known
.
I
suppose
that
was
,
really
,
why
I
liked
him
so
*NL*
much
--
so
infinitely
much
.
Come
to
think
of
it
,
I
can
remember
a
thousand
*NL*
little
acts
of
kindliness
,
of
thoughtfulness
for
his
inferiors
,
even
*NL*
on
the
Continent
.
Look
here
,
I
know
of
two
families
of
dirty
,
*NL*
unpicturesque
,
Hessian
paupers
that
that
fellow
,
with
an
infinite
*NL*
patience
,
rooted
up
,
got
their
police
reports
,
set
on
their
feet
,
or
*NL*
exported
to
my
patient
land
.
And
he
would
do
it
quite
inarticulately
,
*NL*
set
in
motion
by
seeing
a
child
crying
in
the
street
.
He
would
wrestle
*NL*
with
dictionaries
,
in
that
unfamiliar
tongue
...
Well
,
he
could
not
bear
*NL*
to
see
a
child
cry
.
Perhaps
he
could
not
bear
to
see
a
woman
and
not
*NL*
give
her
the
comfort
of
his
physical
attractions
.
But
,
although
I
liked
*NL*
him
so
intensely
,
I
was
rather
apt
to
take
these
things
for
granted
.
*NL*
They
made
me
feel
comfortable
with
him
,
good
towards
him
;
they
made
me
*NL*
trust
him
.
But
I
guess
I
thought
it
was
part
of
the
character
of
any
*NL*
English
gentleman
.
Why
,
one
day
he
got
it
into
his
head
that
the
head
*NL*
waiter
at
the
Excelsior
had
been
crying
--
the
fellow
with
the
grey
*NL*
face
and
grey
whiskers
.
And
then
he
spent
the
best
part
of
a
week
,
in
*NL*
correspondence
and
up
at
the
British
consul
's
,
in
getting
the
fellow
's
*NL*
wife
to
come
back
from
London
and
bring
back
his
girl
baby
.
She
had
*NL*
bolted
with
a
Swiss
scullion
.
If
she
had
not
come
inside
the
week
he
*NL*
would
have
gone
to
London
himself
to
fetch
her
.
He
was
like
that
.
Edward
*NL*
Ashburnham
was
like
that
,
and
I
thought
it
was
only
the
duty
of
his
rank
*NL*
and
station
.
Perhaps
that
was
all
that
it
was
--
but
I
pray
God
to
make
*NL*
me
discharge
mine
as
well
.
And
,
but
for
the
poor
girl
,
I
daresay
that
I
*NL*
should
never
have
seen
it
,
however
much
the
feeling
might
have
been
over
*NL*
me
.
She
had
for
him
such
enthusiasm
that
,
although
even
now
I
do
not
*NL*
understand
the
technicalities
of
English
life
,
I
can
gather
enough
.
She
*NL*
was
with
them
during
the
whole
of
our
last
stay
at
Nauheim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
Rufford
was
her
name
;
she
was
Leonora
's
only
friend
's
only
child
,
*NL*
and
Leonora
was
her
guardian
,
if
that
is
the
correct
term
.
She
had
lived
*NL*
with
the
Ashburnhams
ever
since
she
had
been
of
the
age
of
thirteen
,
*NL*
when
her
mother
was
said
to
have
committed
suicide
owing
to
the
*NL*
brutalities
of
her
father
.
Yes
,
it
is
a
cheerful
story
...
Edward
always
*NL*
called
her
``
the
girl
''
,
and
it
was
very
pretty
,
the
evident
affection
*NL*
he
had
for
her
and
she
for
him
.
And
Leonora
's
feet
she
would
have
*NL*
kissed
--
those
two
were
for
her
the
best
man
and
the
best
woman
on
*NL*
earth
--
and
in
heaven
.
I
think
that
she
had
not
a
thought
of
evil
in
her
*NL*
head
--
the
poor
girl
...
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
anyhow
,
she
chanted
Edward
's
praises
to
me
for
the
hour
together
,
*NL*
but
,
as
I
have
said
,
I
could
not
make
much
of
it
.
It
appeared
that
he
*NL*
had
the
D.S.O.
,
and
that
his
troop
loved
him
beyond
the
love
of
men
.
*NL*
You
never
saw
such
a
troop
as
his
.
And
he
had
the
Royal
Humane
Society
's
*NL*
medal
with
a
clasp
.
That
meant
,
apparently
,
that
he
had
twice
jumped
off
*NL*
the
deck
of
a
troopship
to
rescue
what
the
girl
called
``
Tommies
''
,
who
*NL*
had
fallen
overboard
in
the
Red
Sea
and
such
places
.
He
had
been
twice
*NL*
recommended
for
the
V.C.
,
whatever
that
might
mean
,
and
,
although
owing
*NL*
to
some
technicalities
he
had
never
received
that
apparently
coveted
*NL*
order
,
he
had
some
special
place
about
his
sovereign
at
the
coronation
.
*NL*
Or
perhaps
it
was
some
post
in
the
Beefeaters
'
.
She
made
him
out
like
a
*NL*
cross
between
Lohengrin
and
the
Chevalier
Bayard
.
Perhaps
he
was
...
But
*NL*
he
was
too
silent
a
fellow
to
make
that
side
of
him
really
decorative
.
I
*NL*
remember
going
to
him
at
about
that
time
and
asking
him
what
the
D.S.O.
*NL*
was
,
and
he
grunted
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
sort
of
a
thing
they
give
grocers
who
've
honourably
supplied
the
*NL*
troops
with
adulterated
coffee
in
war-time
''
--
something
of
that
sort
.
He
*NL*
did
not
quite
carry
conviction
to
me
,
so
,
in
the
end
,
I
put
it
directly
*NL*
to
Leonora
.
I
asked
her
fully
and
squarely
--
prefacing
the
question
with
*NL*
some
remarks
,
such
as
those
that
I
have
already
given
you
,
as
to
the
*NL*
difficulty
one
has
in
really
getting
to
know
people
when
one
's
intimacy
*NL*
is
conducted
as
an
English
acquaintanceship
--
I
asked
her
whether
her
*NL*
husband
was
not
really
a
splendid
fellow
--
along
at
least
the
lines
*NL*
of
his
public
functions
.
She
looked
at
me
with
a
slightly
awakened
*NL*
air
--
with
an
air
that
would
have
been
almost
startled
if
Leonora
could
*NL*
ever
have
been
startled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
know
?
''
she
asked
.
``
If
I
come
to
think
of
it
there
is
not
*NL*
a
more
splendid
fellow
in
any
three
counties
,
pick
them
where
you
*NL*
will
--
along
those
lines
.
''
And
she
added
,
after
she
had
looked
at
me
*NL*
reflectively
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
do
my
husband
justice
there
could
not
be
a
better
man
on
the
earth
.
*NL*
There
would
not
be
room
for
it
--
along
those
lines
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
said
,
``
then
he
must
really
be
Lohengrin
and
the
Cid
in
one
*NL*
body
.
For
there
are
not
any
other
lines
that
count
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
looked
at
me
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
your
opinion
that
there
are
no
other
lines
that
count
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
answered
gaily
,
``
you
're
not
going
to
accuse
him
of
not
being
a
*NL*
good
husband
,
or
of
not
being
a
good
guardian
to
your
ward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
then
,
slowly
,
like
a
person
who
is
listening
to
the
sounds
*NL*
in
a
sea-shell
held
to
her
ear
--
and
,
would
you
believe
it
?
--
she
told
me
*NL*
afterwards
that
,
at
that
speech
of
mine
,
for
the
first
time
she
had
a
*NL*
vague
inkling
of
the
tragedy
that
was
to
follow
so
soon
--
although
the
*NL*
girl
had
lived
with
them
for
eight
years
or
so
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
thinking
of
saying
that
he
is
not
the
best
of
husbands
,
or
*NL*
that
he
is
not
very
fond
of
the
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
I
said
something
like
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Leonora
,
a
man
sees
more
of
these
things
than
even
a
wife
.
And
,
*NL*
let
me
tell
you
,
that
in
all
the
years
I
've
known
Edward
he
has
never
,
*NL*
in
your
absence
,
paid
a
moment
's
attention
to
any
other
woman
--
not
by
*NL*
the
quivering
of
an
eyelash
.
I
should
have
noticed
.
And
he
talks
of
you
*NL*
as
if
you
were
one
of
the
angels
of
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
came
up
to
the
scratch
,
as
you
could
be
sure
Leonora
would
*NL*
always
come
up
to
the
scratch
,
``
I
am
perfectly
sure
that
he
always
*NL*
speaks
nicely
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
daresay
she
had
practice
in
that
sort
of
scene
--
people
must
have
been
*NL*
always
complimenting
her
on
her
husband
's
fidelity
and
adoration
.
For
*NL*
half
the
world
--
the
whole
of
the
world
that
knew
Edward
and
Leonora
*NL*
believed
that
his
conviction
in
the
Kilsyte
affair
had
been
a
*NL*
miscarriage
of
justice
--
a
conspiracy
of
false
evidence
,
got
together
by
*NL*
Nonconformist
adversaries
.
But
think
of
the
fool
that
I
was
...
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
LET
me
think
where
we
were
.
Oh
,
yes
...
that
conversation
took
place
on
*NL*
the
4th
of
August
,
1913
.
I
remember
saying
to
her
that
,
on
that
day
,
*NL*
exactly
nine
years
before
,
I
had
made
their
acquaintance
,
so
that
it
had
*NL*
seemed
quite
appropriate
and
like
a
birthday
speech
to
utter
my
little
*NL*
testimonial
to
my
friend
Edward
.
I
could
quite
confidently
say
that
,
*NL*
though
we
four
had
been
about
together
in
all
sorts
of
places
,
for
all
*NL*
that
length
of
time
,
I
had
not
,
for
my
part
,
one
single
complaint
to
*NL*
make
of
either
of
them
.
And
I
added
,
that
that
was
an
unusual
record
for
*NL*
people
who
had
been
so
much
together
.
You
are
not
to
imagine
that
it
was
*NL*
only
at
Nauheim
that
we
met
.
That
would
not
have
suited
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
find
,
on
looking
at
my
diaries
,
that
on
the
4th
of
September
,
1904
,
*NL*
Edward
accompanied
Florence
and
myself
to
Paris
,
where
we
put
him
up
*NL*
till
the
twenty-first
of
that
month
.
He
made
another
short
visit
to
us
*NL*
in
December
of
that
year
--
the
first
year
of
our
acquaintance
.
It
must
*NL*
have
been
during
this
visit
that
he
knocked
Mr
Jimmy
's
teeth
down
his
*NL*
throat
.
I
daresay
Florence
had
asked
him
to
come
over
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
In
1905
he
was
in
Paris
three
times
--
once
with
Leonora
,
who
wanted
some
*NL*
frocks
.
In
1906
we
spent
the
best
part
of
six
weeks
together
at
Mentone
,
*NL*
and
Edward
stayed
with
us
in
Paris
on
his
way
back
to
London
.
That
was
*NL*
how
it
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
that
in
Florence
the
poor
wretch
had
got
hold
of
a
Tartar
,
*NL*
compared
with
whom
Leonora
was
a
sucking
kid
.
He
must
have
had
a
hell
of
*NL*
a
time
.
Leonora
wanted
to
keep
him
for
--
what
shall
I
say
--
for
the
good
*NL*
of
her
church
,
as
it
were
,
to
show
that
Catholic
women
do
not
lose
their
*NL*
men
.
Let
it
go
at
that
,
for
the
moment
.
I
will
write
more
about
her
*NL*
motives
later
,
perhaps
.
But
Florence
was
sticking
on
to
the
proprietor
*NL*
of
the
home
of
her
ancestors
.
No
doubt
he
was
also
a
very
passionate
*NL*
lover
.
But
I
am
convinced
that
he
was
sick
of
Florence
within
three
*NL*
years
of
even
interrupted
companionship
and
the
life
that
she
led
*NL*
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
If
ever
Leonora
so
much
as
mentioned
in
a
letter
that
they
had
had
a
*NL*
woman
staying
with
them
--
or
,
if
she
so
much
as
mentioned
a
woman
's
name
*NL*
in
a
letter
to
me
--
off
would
go
a
desperate
cable
in
cipher
to
that
poor
*NL*
wretch
at
Branshaw
,
commanding
him
on
pain
of
an
instant
and
horrible
*NL*
disclosure
to
come
over
and
assure
her
of
his
fidelity
.
I
daresay
he
*NL*
would
have
faced
it
out
;
I
daresay
he
would
have
thrown
over
Florence
*NL*
and
taken
the
risk
of
exposure
.
But
there
he
had
Leonora
to
deal
with
.
*NL*
And
Leonora
assured
him
that
,
if
the
minutest
fragment
of
the
real
*NL*
situation
ever
got
through
to
my
senses
,
she
would
wreak
upon
him
the
*NL*
most
terrible
vengeance
that
she
could
think
of
.
And
he
did
not
have
a
*NL*
very
easy
job
.
Florence
called
for
more
and
more
attentions
from
him
as
*NL*
the
time
went
on
.
She
would
make
him
kiss
her
at
any
moment
of
the
day
;
*NL*
and
it
was
only
by
his
making
it
plain
that
a
divorced
lady
could
never
*NL*
assume
a
position
in
the
county
of
Hampshire
that
he
could
prevent
*NL*
her
from
making
a
bolt
of
it
with
him
in
her
train
.
Oh
,
yes
,
it
was
a
*NL*
difficult
job
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Florence
,
if
you
please
,
gaining
in
time
a
more
composed
view
of
*NL*
nature
,
and
overcome
by
her
habits
of
garrulity
,
arrived
at
a
frame
*NL*
of
mind
in
which
she
found
it
almost
necessary
to
tell
me
all
about
*NL*
it
--
nothing
less
than
that
.
She
said
that
her
situation
was
too
*NL*
unbearable
with
regard
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
proposed
to
tell
me
all
,
secure
a
divorce
from
me
,
and
go
with
*NL*
Edward
and
settle
in
California
...
I
do
not
suppose
that
she
was
really
*NL*
serious
in
this
.
It
would
have
meant
the
extinction
of
all
hopes
of
*NL*
Branshaw
Manor
for
her
.
Besides
she
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
*NL*
Leonora
,
who
was
as
sound
as
a
roach
,
was
consumptive
.
She
was
always
*NL*
begging
Leonora
,
before
me
,
to
go
and
see
a
doctor
.
But
,
none
the
less
,
*NL*
poor
Edward
seems
to
have
believed
in
her
determination
to
carry
him
*NL*
off
.
He
would
not
have
gone
;
he
cared
for
his
wife
too
much
.
But
,
if
*NL*
Florence
had
put
him
at
it
,
that
would
have
meant
my
getting
to
know
of
*NL*
it
,
and
his
incurring
Leonora
's
vengeance
.
And
she
could
have
made
it
*NL*
pretty
hot
for
him
in
ten
or
a
dozen
different
ways
.
And
she
assured
me
*NL*
that
she
would
have
used
every
one
of
them
.
She
was
determined
to
spare
*NL*
my
feelings
.
And
she
was
quite
aware
that
,
at
that
date
,
the
hottest
she
*NL*
could
have
made
it
for
him
would
have
been
to
refuse
,
herself
,
ever
to
*NL*
see
him
again
...
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
think
I
have
made
it
pretty
clear
.
Let
me
come
to
the
4th
of
*NL*
August
,
1913
,
the
last
day
of
my
absolute
ignorance
--
and
,
I
assure
you
,
*NL*
of
my
perfect
happiness
.
For
the
coming
of
that
dear
girl
only
added
to
*NL*
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
4th
of
August
I
was
sitting
in
the
lounge
with
a
rather
odious
*NL*
Englishman
called
Bagshawe
,
who
had
arrived
that
night
,
too
late
for
*NL*
dinner
.
Leonora
had
just
gone
to
bed
and
I
was
waiting
for
Florence
and
*NL*
Edward
and
the
girl
to
come
back
from
a
concert
at
the
Casino
.
They
had
*NL*
not
gone
there
all
together
.
Florence
,
I
remember
,
had
said
at
first
*NL*
that
she
would
remain
with
Leonora
,
and
me
,
and
Edward
and
the
girl
*NL*
had
gone
off
alone
.
And
then
Leonora
had
said
to
Florence
with
perfect
*NL*
calmness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
go
with
those
two
.
I
think
the
girl
ought
to
have
the
*NL*
appearance
of
being
chaperoned
with
Edward
in
these
places
.
I
think
the
*NL*
time
has
come
.
''
So
Florence
,
with
her
light
step
,
had
slipped
out
after
*NL*
them
.
She
was
all
in
black
for
some
cousin
or
other
.
Americans
are
*NL*
particular
in
those
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
gone
on
sitting
in
the
lounge
till
towards
ten
,
when
Leonora
had
*NL*
gone
up
to
bed
.
It
had
been
a
very
hot
day
,
but
there
it
was
cool
.
The
*NL*
man
called
Bagshawe
had
been
reading
The
Times
on
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
room
,
but
then
he
moved
over
to
me
with
some
trifling
question
as
*NL*
a
prelude
to
suggesting
an
acquaintance
.
I
fancy
he
asked
me
something
*NL*
About
the
poll-tax
on
Kur-guests
,
and
whether
it
could
not
be
sneaked
*NL*
out
of
.
He
was
that
sort
of
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
was
an
unmistakable
man
,
with
a
military
figure
,
rather
*NL*
exaggerated
,
with
bulbous
eyes
that
avoided
your
own
,
and
a
pallid
*NL*
complexion
that
suggested
vices
practised
in
secret
along
with
an
uneasy
*NL*
desire
for
making
acquaintance
at
whatever
cost
...
The
filthy
toad
...
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
by
telling
me
that
he
came
from
Ludlow
Manor
,
near
Ledbury
.
*NL*
The
name
had
a
slightly
familiar
sound
,
though
I
could
not
fix
it
in
*NL*
my
mind
.
Then
he
began
to
talk
about
a
duty
on
hops
,
about
Californian
*NL*
hops
,
about
Los
Angeles
,
where
he
had
been
.
He
fencing
for
a
topic
with
*NL*
which
he
might
gain
my
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
quite
suddenly
,
in
the
bright
light
of
the
street
,
I
saw
*NL*
Florence
running
.
It
was
like
that
--
I
saw
Florence
running
with
a
face
*NL*
whiter
than
paper
and
her
hand
on
the
black
stuff
over
her
heart
.
I
tell
*NL*
you
,
my
own
heart
stood
still
;
I
tell
you
I
could
not
move
.
She
rushed
*NL*
in
at
the
swing
doors
.
She
looked
round
that
place
of
rush
chairs
,
cane
*NL*
tables
and
newspapers
.
She
saw
me
and
opened
her
lips
.
She
saw
the
*NL*
man
who
was
talking
to
me
.
She
stuck
her
hands
over
her
face
as
if
she
*NL*
wished
to
push
her
eyes
out
.
And
she
was
not
there
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
move
;
I
could
not
stir
a
finger
.
And
then
that
man
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
:
Florry
Hurlbird
.
''
He
turned
upon
me
with
an
oily
and
uneasy
*NL*
sound
meant
for
a
laugh
.
He
was
really
going
to
ingratiate
himself
with
*NL*
me
.
``
Do
you
know
who
that
is
?
''
he
asked
.
``
The
last
time
I
saw
that
girl
*NL*
she
was
coming
out
of
the
bedroom
of
a
young
man
called
Jimmy
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
In
my
house
at
Ledbury
.
You
saw
her
recognize
*NL*
me
.
''
He
was
standing
on
his
feet
,
looking
down
at
me
.
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
I
looked
like
.
At
any
rate
,
he
gave
a
sort
of
gurgle
and
then
stuttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
...
''
Those
were
the
last
words
I
ever
heard
of
Mr
Bagshawe
's
.
*NL*
A
long
time
afterwards
I
pulled
myself
out
of
the
lounge
and
went
up
to
*NL*
Florence
's
room
.
She
had
not
locked
the
door
--
for
the
first
time
of
*NL*
our
married
life
.
She
was
lying
,
quite
respectably
arranged
,
unlike
*NL*
Mrs
Maidan
,
on
her
bed
.
She
had
a
little
phial
that
rightly
should
have
*NL*
contained
nitrate
of
amyl
,
in
her
right
hand
.
That
was
on
the
4th
of
*NL*
August
,
1913
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
PART
III
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
odd
thing
is
that
what
sticks
out
in
my
recollection
of
the
rest
of
*NL*
that
evening
was
Leonora
's
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
might
marry
her
,
''
and
,
when
I
asked
whom
,
she
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
is
to
me
a
very
amazing
thing
--
amazing
for
the
light
of
*NL*
possibilities
that
it
casts
into
the
human
heart
.
For
I
had
never
had
*NL*
the
slightest
conscious
idea
of
marrying
the
girl
;
I
never
had
the
*NL*
slightest
idea
even
of
caring
for
her
.
I
must
have
talked
in
an
odd
way
,
*NL*
as
people
do
who
are
recovering
from
an
anaesthetic
.
It
is
as
if
one
had
*NL*
a
dual
personality
,
the
one
I
being
entirely
unconscious
of
the
other
.
*NL*
I
had
thought
nothing
;
I
had
said
such
an
extraordinary
thing
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
that
analysis
of
my
own
psychology
matters
at
all
to
this
story
.
*NL*
I
should
say
that
it
did
n't
or
,
at
any
rate
,
that
I
had
given
enough
of
*NL*
it
.
But
that
odd
remark
of
mine
had
a
strong
influence
upon
what
came
*NL*
after
.
I
mean
,
that
Leonora
would
probably
never
have
spoken
to
me
at
*NL*
all
about
Florence
's
relations
with
Edward
if
I
had
n't
said
,
two
hours
*NL*
after
my
wife
's
death
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
can
marry
the
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
,
then
,
taken
it
for
granted
that
I
had
been
suffering
all
that
*NL*
she
had
been
suffering
,
or
,
at
least
,
that
I
had
permitted
all
that
she
*NL*
had
permitted
.
So
that
,
a
month
ago
,
about
a
week
after
the
funeral
of
*NL*
poor
Edward
,
she
could
say
to
me
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
--
I
*NL*
had
been
talking
about
the
duration
of
my
stay
at
Branshaw
--
she
said
*NL*
with
her
clear
,
reflective
intonation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
stop
here
for
ever
and
ever
if
you
can
.
''
And
then
she
added
,
``
You
*NL*
could
n't
be
more
of
a
brother
to
me
,
or
more
of
a
counsellor
,
or
more
of
*NL*
a
support
.
You
are
all
the
consolation
I
have
in
the
world
.
And
is
n't
*NL*
it
odd
to
think
that
if
your
wife
had
n't
been
my
husband
's
mistress
,
you
*NL*
would
probably
never
have
been
here
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
how
I
got
the
news
--
full
in
the
face
,
like
that
.
I
did
n't
say
*NL*
anything
and
I
do
n't
suppose
I
felt
anything
,
unless
maybe
it
was
with
*NL*
that
mysterious
and
unconscious
self
that
underlies
most
people
.
Perhaps
*NL*
one
day
when
I
am
unconscious
or
walking
in
my
sleep
I
may
go
and
spit
*NL*
upon
poor
Edward
's
grave
.
It
seems
about
the
most
unlikely
thing
I
could
*NL*
do
;
but
there
it
is
.
No
,
I
remember
no
emotion
of
any
sort
,
but
just
the
*NL*
clear
feeling
that
one
has
from
time
to
time
when
one
hears
that
some
*NL*
Mrs
So-and-So
is
au
mieux
with
a
certain
gentleman
.
It
made
things
*NL*
plainer
,
suddenly
,
to
my
curiosity
.
It
was
as
if
I
thought
,
at
that
*NL*
moment
,
of
a
windy
November
evening
,
that
,
when
I
came
to
think
it
over
*NL*
afterwards
,
a
dozen
unexplained
things
would
fit
themselves
into
place
.
*NL*
But
I
was
n't
thinking
things
over
then
.
I
remember
that
distinctly
.
I
*NL*
was
just
sitting
back
,
rather
stiffly
,
in
a
deep
arm-chair
.
That
is
what
*NL*
I
remember
.
It
was
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Branshaw
Manor
lies
in
a
little
hollow
with
lawns
across
it
and
*NL*
pine-woods
on
the
fringe
of
the
dip
.
The
immense
wind
,
coming
from
*NL*
across
the
forest
,
roared
overhead
.
But
the
view
from
the
window
was
*NL*
perfectly
quiet
and
grey
.
Not
a
thing
stirred
,
except
a
couple
of
*NL*
rabbits
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
lawn
.
It
was
Leonora
's
own
little
*NL*
study
that
we
were
in
and
we
were
waiting
for
the
tea
to
be
brought
.
I
,
*NL*
as
I
said
,
was
sitting
in
the
deep
chair
,
Leonora
was
standing
in
the
*NL*
window
twirling
the
wooden
acorn
at
the
end
of
the
window-blind
cord
*NL*
desultorily
round
and
round
.
She
looked
across
the
lawn
and
said
,
as
far
*NL*
as
I
can
remember
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edward
has
been
dead
only
ten
days
and
yet
there
are
rabbits
on
the
*NL*
lawn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
understand
that
rabbits
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
to
the
short
grass
in
*NL*
England
.
And
then
she
turned
round
to
me
and
said
without
any
adornment
*NL*
at
all
,
for
I
remember
her
exact
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
was
stupid
of
Florence
to
commit
suicide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
tell
you
the
extraordinary
sense
of
leisure
that
we
two
seemed
*NL*
to
have
at
that
moment
.
It
was
n't
as
if
we
were
waiting
for
a
train
,
*NL*
it
was
n't
as
if
we
were
waiting
for
a
meal
--
it
was
just
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
wait
for
.
Nothing
.
There
was
an
extreme
stillness
with
the
*NL*
remote
and
intermittent
sound
of
the
wind
.
There
was
the
grey
light
in
*NL*
that
brown
,
small
room
.
And
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
else
in
the
*NL*
world
.
I
knew
then
that
Leonora
was
about
to
let
me
into
her
full
*NL*
confidence
.
It
was
as
if
--
or
no
,
it
was
the
actual
fact
that
--
Leonora
*NL*
with
an
odd
English
sense
of
decency
had
determined
to
wait
until
Edward
*NL*
had
been
in
his
grave
for
a
full
week
before
she
spoke
.
And
with
some
*NL*
vague
motive
of
giving
her
an
idea
of
the
extent
to
which
she
must
*NL*
permit
herself
to
make
confidences
,
I
said
slowly
--
and
these
words
too
I
*NL*
remember
with
exactitude
--
``
Did
Florence
commit
suicide
?
I
did
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
just
,
you
understand
,
trying
to
let
her
know
that
,
if
she
were
*NL*
going
to
speak
she
would
have
to
talk
about
a
much
wider
range
of
things
*NL*
than
she
had
before
thought
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
that
was
the
first
knowledge
I
had
that
Florence
had
committed
*NL*
suicide
.
It
had
never
entered
my
head
.
You
may
think
that
I
had
been
*NL*
singularly
lacking
in
suspiciousness
;
you
may
consider
me
even
to
have
*NL*
been
an
imbecile
.
But
consider
the
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
circumstances
of
clamour
,
of
outcry
,
of
the
crash
of
many
*NL*
people
running
together
,
of
the
professional
reticence
of
such
people
*NL*
as
hotel-keepers
,
the
traditional
reticence
of
such
``
good
people
''
as
the
*NL*
Ashburnhams
--
in
such
circumstances
it
is
some
little
material
object
,
*NL*
always
,
that
catches
the
eye
and
that
appeals
to
the
imagination
.
I
had
*NL*
no
possible
guide
to
the
idea
of
suicide
and
the
sight
of
the
little
*NL*
flask
of
nitrate
of
amyl
in
Florence
's
hand
suggested
instantly
to
*NL*
my
mind
the
idea
of
the
failure
of
her
heart
.
Nitrate
of
amyl
,
you
*NL*
understand
,
is
the
drug
that
is
given
to
relieve
sufferers
from
angina
*NL*
pectoris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
Florence
,
as
I
had
seen
her
,
running
with
a
white
face
and
*NL*
with
one
hand
held
over
her
heart
,
and
seeing
her
,
as
I
immediately
*NL*
afterwards
saw
her
,
lying
upon
her
bed
with
the
so
familiar
little
brown
*NL*
flask
clenched
in
her
fingers
,
it
was
natural
enough
for
my
mind
to
*NL*
frame
the
idea
.
As
happened
now
and
again
,
I
thought
,
she
had
gone
out
*NL*
without
her
remedy
and
,
having
felt
an
attack
coming
on
whilst
she
was
*NL*
in
the
gardens
,
she
had
run
in
to
get
the
nitrate
in
order
,
as
quickly
*NL*
as
possible
,
to
obtain
relief
.
And
it
was
equally
inevitable
my
mind
*NL*
should
frame
the
thought
that
her
heart
,
unable
to
stand
the
strain
*NL*
of
the
running
,
should
have
broken
in
her
side
.
How
could
I
have
known
*NL*
that
,
during
all
the
years
of
our
married
life
,
that
little
brown
*NL*
flask
had
contained
,
not
nitrate
of
amyl
,
but
prussic
acid
?
It
was
*NL*
inconceivable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
not
even
Edward
Ashburnham
,
who
was
,
after
all
more
intimate
with
*NL*
her
than
I
was
,
had
an
inkling
of
the
truth
.
He
just
thought
that
she
*NL*
had
dropped
dead
of
heart
disease
.
Indeed
,
I
fancy
that
the
only
people
*NL*
who
ever
knew
that
Florence
had
committed
suicide
were
Leonora
,
the
*NL*
Grand
Duke
,
the
head
of
the
police
and
the
hotel-keeper
.
I
mention
these
*NL*
last
three
because
my
recollection
of
that
night
is
only
the
sort
of
*NL*
pinkish
effulgence
from
the
electric-lamps
in
the
hotel
lounge
.
There
*NL*
seemed
to
bob
into
my
consciousness
,
like
floating
globes
,
the
faces
of
*NL*
those
three
.
Now
it
would
be
the
bearded
,
monarchical
,
benevolent
head
*NL*
of
the
Grand
Duke
;
then
the
sharp-featured
,
brown
,
cavalry-moustached
*NL*
feature
of
the
chief
of
police
;
then
the
globular
,
polished
and
*NL*
high-collared
vacuousness
that
represented
Monsieur
Schontz
,
the
*NL*
proprietor
of
the
hotel
.
At
times
one
head
would
be
there
alone
,
at
*NL*
another
the
spiked
helmet
of
the
official
would
be
close
to
the
healthy
*NL*
baldness
of
the
prince
;
then
M.
Schontz
's
oiled
locks
would
push
in
*NL*
between
the
two
.
The
sovereign
's
soft
,
exquisitely
trained
voice
would
*NL*
say
,
``
Ja
,
ja
,
ja
!
''
each
word
dropping
out
like
so
many
soft
pellets
*NL*
of
suet
;
the
subdued
rasp
of
the
official
would
come
:
``
Zum
Befehl
*NL*
Durchlaucht
,
''
like
five
revolver-shots
;
the
voice
of
M.
Schontz
would
go
*NL*
on
and
on
under
its
breath
like
that
of
an
unclean
priest
reciting
*NL*
from
his
breviary
in
the
corner
of
a
railway-carriage
.
That
was
how
it
*NL*
presented
itself
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
me
;
I
do
n't
suppose
that
I
was
even
*NL*
addressed
by
one
of
them
.
But
,
as
long
as
one
or
the
other
,
or
all
three
*NL*
of
them
were
there
,
they
stood
between
me
as
if
,
I
being
the
titular
*NL*
possessor
of
the
corpse
,
had
a
right
to
be
present
at
their
conferences
.
*NL*
Then
they
all
went
away
and
I
was
left
alone
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
thought
nothing
;
absolutely
nothing
.
I
had
no
ideas
;
I
had
no
*NL*
strength
.
I
felt
no
sorrow
,
no
desire
for
action
,
no
inclination
to
*NL*
go
upstairs
and
fall
upon
the
body
of
my
wife
.
I
just
saw
the
pink
*NL*
effulgence
,
the
cane
tables
,
the
palms
,
the
globular
match-holders
,
the
*NL*
indented
ash-trays
.
And
then
Leonora
came
to
me
and
it
appears
that
I
*NL*
addressed
to
her
that
singular
remark
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
can
marry
the
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
have
given
you
absolutely
the
whole
of
my
recollection
of
that
*NL*
evening
,
as
it
is
the
whole
of
my
recollection
of
the
succeeding
three
*NL*
or
four
days
.
I
was
in
a
state
just
simply
cataleptic
.
They
put
me
to
*NL*
bed
and
I
stayed
there
;
they
brought
me
my
clothes
and
I
dressed
;
they
*NL*
led
me
to
an
open
grave
and
I
stood
beside
it
.
If
they
had
taken
me
to
*NL*
the
edge
of
a
river
,
or
if
they
had
flung
me
beneath
a
railway
train
,
*NL*
I
should
have
been
drowned
or
mangled
in
the
same
spirit
.
I
was
the
*NL*
walking
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
those
are
my
impressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
actually
happened
had
been
this
.
I
pieced
it
together
*NL*
afterwards
.
You
will
remember
I
said
that
Edward
Ashburnham
and
the
girl
*NL*
had
gone
off
,
that
night
,
to
a
concert
at
the
Casino
and
that
Leonora
*NL*
had
asked
Florence
,
almost
immediately
after
their
departure
,
to
follow
*NL*
them
and
to
perform
the
office
of
chaperone
.
Florence
,
you
may
also
*NL*
remember
,
was
all
in
black
,
being
the
mourning
that
she
wore
for
a
*NL*
deceased
cousin
,
Jean
Hurlbird
.
It
was
a
very
black
night
and
the
girl
*NL*
was
dressed
in
cream-coloured
muslin
,
that
must
have
glimmered
under
the
*NL*
tall
trees
of
the
dark
park
like
a
phosphorescent
fish
in
a
cupboard
.
*NL*
You
could
n't
have
had
a
better
beacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
appears
that
Edward
Ashburnham
led
the
girl
not
up
the
straight
*NL*
allee
that
leads
to
the
Casino
,
but
in
under
the
dark
trees
of
the
park
.
*NL*
Edward
Ashburnham
told
me
all
this
in
his
final
outburst
.
I
have
told
*NL*
you
that
,
upon
that
occasion
,
he
became
deucedly
vocal
.
I
did
n't
pump
*NL*
him
.
I
had
n't
any
motive
.
At
that
time
I
did
n't
in
the
least
connect
him
*NL*
with
my
wife
.
But
the
fellow
talked
like
a
cheap
novelist
.
--
Or
like
a
*NL*
very
good
novelist
for
the
matter
of
that
,
if
it
's
the
business
of
a
*NL*
novelist
to
make
you
see
things
clearly
.
And
I
tell
you
I
see
that
thing
*NL*
as
clearly
as
if
it
were
a
dream
that
never
left
me
.
It
appears
that
,
*NL*
not
very
far
from
the
Casino
,
he
and
the
girl
sat
down
in
the
darkness
*NL*
upon
a
public
bench
.
The
lights
from
that
place
of
entertainment
must
*NL*
have
reached
them
through
the
tree-trunks
,
since
,
Edward
said
,
he
could
*NL*
quite
plainly
see
the
girl
's
face
--
that
beloved
face
with
the
high
*NL*
forehead
,
the
queer
mouth
,
the
tortured
eyebrows
,
and
the
direct
eyes
.
*NL*
And
to
Florence
,
creeping
up
behind
them
,
they
must
have
presented
the
*NL*
appearance
of
silhouettes
.
For
I
take
it
that
Florence
came
creeping
up
*NL*
behind
them
over
the
short
grass
to
a
tree
that
,
I
quite
well
remember
,
*NL*
was
immediately
behind
that
public
seat
.
It
was
not
a
very
difficult
*NL*
feat
for
a
woman
instinct
with
jealousy
.
The
Casino
orchestra
was
,
as
*NL*
Edward
remembered
to
tell
me
,
playing
the
Rakocsy
march
,
and
although
*NL*
it
was
not
loud
enough
,
at
that
distance
,
to
drown
the
voice
of
Edward
*NL*
Ashburnham
it
was
certainly
sufficiently
audible
to
efface
,
amongst
the
*NL*
noises
of
the
night
,
the
slight
brushings
and
rustlings
that
might
have
*NL*
been
made
by
the
feet
of
Florence
or
by
her
gown
in
coming
over
the
*NL*
short
grass
.
And
that
miserable
woman
must
have
got
it
in
the
face
,
*NL*
good
and
strong
.
It
must
have
been
horrible
for
her
.
Horrible
!
Well
,
I
*NL*
suppose
she
deserved
all
that
she
got
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anyhow
,
there
you
have
the
picture
,
the
immensely
tall
trees
,
elms
most
*NL*
of
them
,
towering
and
feathering
away
up
into
the
black
mistiness
that
*NL*
trees
seem
to
gather
about
them
at
night
;
the
silhouettes
of
those
two
*NL*
upon
the
seat
;
the
beams
of
light
coming
from
the
Casino
,
the
woman
all
*NL*
in
black
peeping
with
fear
behind
the
tree-trunk
.
It
is
melodrama
;
but
I
*NL*
ca
n't
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
it
appears
,
something
happened
to
Edward
Ashburnham
.
He
*NL*
assured
me
--
and
I
see
no
reason
for
disbelieving
him
--
that
until
that
*NL*
moment
he
had
had
no
idea
whatever
of
caring
for
the
girl
.
He
said
that
*NL*
he
had
regarded
her
exactly
as
he
would
have
regarded
a
daughter
.
He
*NL*
certainly
loved
her
,
but
with
a
very
deep
,
very
tender
and
very
tranquil
*NL*
love
.
He
had
missed
her
when
she
went
away
to
her
convent-school
;
he
*NL*
had
been
glad
when
she
had
returned
.
But
of
more
than
that
he
had
been
*NL*
totally
unconscious
.
Had
he
been
conscious
of
it
,
he
assured
me
,
he
*NL*
would
have
fled
from
it
as
from
a
thing
accursed
.
He
realized
that
it
*NL*
was
the
last
outrage
upon
Leonora
.
But
the
real
point
was
his
entire
*NL*
unconsciousness
.
He
had
gone
with
her
into
that
dark
park
with
no
*NL*
quickening
of
the
pulse
,
with
no
desire
for
the
intimacy
of
solitude
.
*NL*
He
had
gone
,
intending
to
talk
about
polo-ponies
,
and
tennis-racquets
;
*NL*
about
the
temperament
of
the
reverend
Mother
at
the
convent
she
had
left
*NL*
and
about
whether
her
frock
for
a
party
when
they
got
home
should
be
*NL*
white
or
blue
.
It
had
n't
come
into
his
head
that
they
would
talk
about
a
*NL*
single
thing
that
they
had
n't
always
talked
about
;
it
had
not
even
*NL*
come
into
his
head
that
the
tabu
which
extended
around
her
was
not
*NL*
inviolable
.
And
then
,
suddenly
,
that
--
He
was
very
careful
to
assure
me
*NL*
that
at
that
time
there
was
no
physical
motive
about
his
declaration
.
It
*NL*
did
not
appear
to
him
to
be
a
matter
of
a
dark
night
and
a
propinquity
*NL*
and
so
on
.
No
,
it
was
simply
of
her
effect
on
the
moral
side
of
his
life
*NL*
that
he
appears
to
have
talked
.
He
said
that
he
never
had
the
slightest
*NL*
notion
to
enfold
her
in
his
arms
or
so
much
as
to
touch
her
hand
.
He
*NL*
swore
that
he
did
not
touch
her
hand
.
He
said
that
they
sat
,
she
at
one
*NL*
end
of
the
bench
,
he
at
the
other
;
he
leaning
slightly
towards
her
*NL*
and
she
looking
straight
towards
the
light
of
the
Casino
,
her
face
*NL*
illuminated
by
the
lamps
.
The
expression
upon
her
face
he
could
only
*NL*
describe
as
``
queer
''
.
At
another
time
,
indeed
,
he
made
it
appear
that
he
*NL*
thought
she
was
glad
.
It
is
easy
to
imagine
that
she
was
glad
,
since
*NL*
at
that
time
she
could
have
had
no
idea
of
what
was
really
happening
.
*NL*
Frankly
,
she
adored
Edward
Ashburnham
.
He
was
for
her
,
in
everything
*NL*
that
she
said
at
that
time
,
the
model
of
humanity
,
the
hero
,
the
*NL*
athlete
,
the
father
of
his
country
,
the
law-giver
.
So
that
for
her
,
*NL*
to
be
suddenly
,
intimately
and
overwhelmingly
praised
must
have
been
*NL*
a
matter
for
mere
gladness
,
however
overwhelming
it
were
.
It
must
have
*NL*
been
as
if
a
god
had
approved
her
handiwork
or
a
king
her
loyalty
.
She
*NL*
just
sat
still
and
listened
,
smiling
.
And
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
the
*NL*
bitterness
of
her
childhood
,
the
terrors
of
her
tempestuous
father
,
the
*NL*
bewailings
of
her
cruel-tongued
mother
were
suddenly
atoned
for
.
She
*NL*
had
her
recompense
at
last
.
Because
,
of
course
,
if
you
come
to
figure
*NL*
it
out
,
a
sudden
pouring
forth
of
passion
by
a
man
whom
you
regard
as
a
*NL*
cross
between
a
pastor
and
a
father
might
,
to
a
woman
,
have
the
aspect
*NL*
of
mere
praise
for
good
conduct
.
It
would
n't
,
I
mean
,
appear
at
all
in
*NL*
the
light
of
an
attempt
to
gain
possession
.
The
girl
,
at
least
,
regarded
*NL*
him
as
firmly
anchored
to
his
Leonora
.
She
had
not
the
slightest
inkling
*NL*
of
any
infidelities
.
He
had
always
spoken
to
her
of
his
wife
in
terms
of
*NL*
reverence
and
deep
affection
.
He
had
given
her
the
idea
that
he
regarded
*NL*
Leonora
as
absolutely
impeccable
and
as
absolutely
satisfying
.
Their
*NL*
union
had
appeared
to
her
to
be
one
of
those
blessed
things
that
are
*NL*
spoken
of
and
contemplated
with
reverence
by
her
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
,
when
he
spoke
of
her
as
being
the
person
he
cared
most
for
in
*NL*
the
world
,
she
naturally
thought
that
he
meant
to
except
Leonora
and
*NL*
she
was
just
glad
.
It
was
like
a
father
saying
that
he
approved
of
a
*NL*
marriageable
daughter
...
And
Edward
,
when
he
realized
what
he
was
doing
,
*NL*
curbed
his
tongue
at
once
.
She
was
just
glad
and
she
went
on
being
just
*NL*
glad
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
that
that
was
the
most
monstrously
wicked
thing
that
Edward
*NL*
Ashburnham
ever
did
in
his
life
.
And
yet
I
am
so
near
to
all
these
*NL*
people
that
I
can
not
think
any
of
them
wicked
.
It
is
impossible
of
me
*NL*
to
think
of
Edward
Ashburnham
as
anything
but
straight
,
upright
and
*NL*
honourable
.
That
,
I
mean
,
is
,
in
spite
of
everything
,
my
permanent
view
*NL*
of
him
.
I
try
at
times
by
dwelling
on
some
of
the
things
that
he
did
*NL*
to
push
that
image
of
him
away
,
as
you
might
try
to
push
aside
a
large
*NL*
pendulum
.
But
it
always
comes
back
--
the
memory
of
his
innumerable
acts
*NL*
of
kindness
,
of
his
efficiency
,
of
his
unspiteful
tongue
.
He
was
such
a
*NL*
fine
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
feel
myself
forced
to
attempt
to
excuse
him
in
this
as
in
so
many
*NL*
other
things
.
It
is
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
a
most
monstrous
thing
to
attempt
*NL*
to
corrupt
a
young
girl
just
out
of
a
convent
.
But
I
think
Edward
had
*NL*
no
idea
at
all
of
corrupting
her
.
I
believe
that
he
simply
loved
her
.
*NL*
He
said
that
that
was
the
way
of
it
and
I
,
at
least
,
believe
him
and
I
*NL*
believe
too
that
she
was
the
only
woman
he
ever
really
loved
.
He
said
*NL*
that
that
was
so
;
and
he
did
enough
to
prove
it
.
And
Leonora
said
that
*NL*
it
was
so
and
Leonora
knew
him
to
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
come
to
be
very
much
of
a
cynic
in
these
matters
;
I
mean
that
it
*NL*
is
impossible
to
believe
in
the
permanence
of
man
's
or
woman
's
love
.
Or
,
*NL*
at
any
rate
,
it
is
impossible
to
believe
in
the
permanence
of
any
early
*NL*
passion
.
As
I
see
it
,
at
least
,
with
regard
to
man
,
a
love
affair
,
a
*NL*
love
for
any
definite
woman
--
is
something
in
the
nature
of
a
widening
*NL*
of
the
experience
.
With
each
new
woman
that
a
man
is
attracted
to
*NL*
there
appears
to
come
a
broadening
of
the
outlook
,
or
,
if
you
like
,
an
*NL*
acquiring
of
new
territory
.
A
turn
of
the
eyebrow
,
a
tone
of
the
voice
,
*NL*
a
queer
characteristic
gesture
--
all
these
things
,
and
it
is
these
things
*NL*
that
cause
to
arise
the
passion
of
love
--
all
these
things
are
like
so
*NL*
many
objects
on
the
horizon
of
the
landscape
that
tempt
a
man
to
walk
*NL*
beyond
the
horizon
,
to
explore
.
He
wants
to
get
,
as
it
were
,
behind
*NL*
those
eyebrows
with
the
peculiar
turn
,
as
if
he
desired
to
see
the
world
*NL*
with
the
eyes
that
they
overshadow
.
He
wants
to
hear
that
voice
applying
*NL*
itself
to
every
possible
proposition
,
to
every
possible
topic
;
he
wants
*NL*
to
see
those
characteristic
gestures
against
every
possible
background
.
*NL*
Of
the
question
of
the
sex-instinct
I
know
very
little
and
I
do
not
*NL*
think
that
it
counts
for
very
much
in
a
really
great
passion
.
It
can
be
*NL*
aroused
by
such
nothings
--
by
an
untied
shoelace
,
by
a
glance
of
the
*NL*
eye
in
passing
--
that
I
think
it
might
be
left
out
of
the
calculation
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
any
great
passion
can
exist
without
a
desire
for
*NL*
consummation
.
That
seems
to
me
to
be
a
commonplace
and
to
be
therefore
a
*NL*
matter
needing
no
comment
at
all
.
It
is
a
thing
,
with
all
its
accidents
,
*NL*
that
must
be
taken
for
granted
,
as
,
in
a
novel
,
or
a
biography
,
you
*NL*
take
it
for
granted
that
the
characters
have
their
meals
with
some
*NL*
regularity
.
But
the
real
fierceness
of
desire
,
the
real
heat
of
a
*NL*
passion
long
continued
and
withering
up
the
soul
of
a
man
is
the
craving
*NL*
for
identity
with
the
woman
that
he
loves
.
He
desires
to
see
with
the
*NL*
same
eyes
,
to
touch
with
the
same
sense
of
touch
,
to
hear
with
the
*NL*
same
ears
,
to
lose
his
identity
,
to
be
enveloped
,
to
be
supported
.
For
,
*NL*
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
relation
of
the
sexes
,
there
is
no
man
who
*NL*
loves
a
woman
that
does
not
desire
to
come
to
her
for
the
renewal
of
his
*NL*
courage
,
for
the
cutting
asunder
of
his
difficulties
.
And
that
will
be
*NL*
the
mainspring
of
his
desire
for
her
.
We
are
all
so
afraid
,
we
are
*NL*
all
so
alone
,
we
all
so
need
from
the
outside
the
assurance
of
our
own
*NL*
worthiness
to
exist
.
So
,
for
a
time
,
if
such
a
passion
come
to
fruition
,
*NL*
the
man
will
get
what
he
wants
.
He
will
get
the
moral
support
,
the
*NL*
encouragement
,
the
relief
from
the
sense
of
loneliness
,
the
assurance
of
*NL*
his
own
worth
.
But
these
things
pass
away
;
inevitably
they
pass
away
as
*NL*
the
shadows
pass
across
sundials
.
It
is
sad
,
but
it
is
so
.
The
pages
*NL*
of
the
book
will
become
familiar
;
the
beautiful
corner
of
the
road
will
*NL*
have
been
turned
too
many
times
.
Well
,
this
is
the
saddest
story
.
And
*NL*
yet
I
do
believe
that
for
every
man
there
comes
at
last
a
woman
--
or
no
,
*NL*
that
is
the
wrong
way
of
formulating
it
.
For
every
man
there
comes
*NL*
at
last
a
time
of
life
when
the
woman
who
then
sets
her
seal
upon
his
*NL*
imagination
has
set
her
seal
for
good
.
He
will
travel
over
no
more
*NL*
horizons
;
he
will
never
again
set
the
knapsack
over
his
shoulders
;
he
*NL*
will
retire
from
those
scenes
.
He
will
have
gone
out
of
the
business
.
*NL*
That
at
any
rate
was
the
case
with
Edward
and
the
poor
girl
.
It
was
*NL*
quite
literally
the
case
.
It
was
quite
literally
the
case
that
his
*NL*
passions
--
for
the
mistress
of
the
Grand
Duke
,
for
Mrs
Basil
,
for
little
*NL*
Mrs
Maidan
,
for
Florence
,
for
whom
you
will
--
these
passions
were
merely
*NL*
preliminary
canters
compared
to
his
final
race
with
death
for
her
.
I
*NL*
am
certain
of
that
.
I
am
not
going
to
be
so
American
as
to
say
that
all
*NL*
true
love
demands
some
sacrifice
.
It
does
n't
.
But
I
think
that
love
will
*NL*
be
truer
and
more
permanent
in
which
self-sacrifice
has
been
exacted
.
*NL*
And
,
in
the
case
of
the
other
women
,
Edward
just
cut
in
and
cut
them
*NL*
out
as
he
did
with
the
polo-ball
from
under
the
nose
of
Count
Baron
von
*NL*
Leloeffel
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
he
did
n't
wear
himself
as
thin
as
a
*NL*
lath
in
the
endeavour
to
capture
the
other
women
;
but
over
her
he
wore
*NL*
himself
to
rags
and
tatters
and
death
--
in
the
effort
to
leave
her
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
in
speaking
to
her
on
that
night
,
he
was
n't
,
I
am
convinced
,
*NL*
committing
a
baseness
.
It
was
as
if
his
passion
for
her
had
n't
existed
;
*NL*
as
if
the
very
words
that
he
spoke
,
without
knowing
that
he
spoke
them
,
*NL*
created
the
passion
as
they
went
along
.
Before
he
spoke
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
;
afterwards
,
it
was
the
integral
fact
of
his
life
.
Well
,
I
must
*NL*
get
back
to
my
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
story
was
concerning
itself
with
Florence
--
with
Florence
,
*NL*
who
heard
those
words
from
behind
the
tree
.
That
of
course
is
only
*NL*
conjecture
,
but
I
think
the
conjecture
is
pretty
well
justified
.
You
*NL*
have
the
fact
that
those
two
went
out
,
that
she
followed
them
almost
*NL*
immediately
afterwards
through
the
darkness
and
,
a
little
later
,
she
*NL*
came
running
back
to
the
hotel
with
that
pallid
face
and
the
hand
*NL*
clutching
her
dress
over
her
heart
.
It
ca
n't
have
been
only
Bagshawe
.
*NL*
Her
face
was
contorted
with
agony
before
ever
her
eyes
fell
upon
me
*NL*
or
upon
him
beside
me
.
But
I
dare
say
Bagshawe
may
have
been
the
*NL*
determining
influence
in
her
suicide
.
Leonora
says
that
she
had
that
*NL*
flask
,
apparently
of
nitrate
of
amyl
,
but
actually
of
prussic
acid
,
for
*NL*
many
years
and
that
she
was
determined
to
use
it
if
ever
I
discovered
*NL*
the
nature
of
her
relationship
with
that
fellow
Jimmy
.
You
see
,
the
*NL*
mainspring
of
her
nature
must
have
been
vanity
.
There
is
no
reason
why
*NL*
it
should
n't
have
been
;
I
guess
it
is
vanity
that
makes
most
of
us
keep
*NL*
straight
,
if
we
do
keep
straight
,
in
this
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
been
merely
a
matter
of
Edward
's
relations
with
the
girl
I
*NL*
dare
say
Florence
would
have
faced
it
out
.
She
would
no
doubt
have
made
*NL*
him
scenes
,
have
threatened
him
,
have
appealed
to
his
sense
of
humour
,
*NL*
to
his
promises
.
But
Mr
Bagshawe
and
the
fact
that
the
date
was
the
4th
*NL*
of
August
must
have
been
too
much
for
her
superstitious
mind
.
You
see
,
*NL*
she
had
two
things
that
she
wanted
.
She
wanted
to
be
a
great
lady
,
*NL*
installed
in
Branshaw
Teleragh
.
She
wanted
also
to
retain
my
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
,
that
is
to
say
,
to
retain
my
respect
for
as
long
as
she
*NL*
lived
with
me
.
I
suppose
,
if
she
had
persuaded
Edward
Ashburnham
to
bolt
*NL*
with
her
she
would
have
let
the
whole
thing
go
with
a
run
.
Or
perhaps
*NL*
she
would
have
tried
to
exact
from
me
a
new
respect
for
the
greatness
of
*NL*
her
passion
on
the
lines
of
all
for
love
and
the
world
well
lost
.
That
*NL*
would
be
just
like
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
matrimonial
associations
there
is
,
I
believe
,
one
constant
*NL*
factor
--
a
desire
to
deceive
the
person
with
whom
one
lives
as
to
some
*NL*
weak
spot
in
one
's
character
or
in
one
's
career
.
For
it
is
intolerable
*NL*
to
live
constantly
with
one
human
being
who
perceives
one
's
small
*NL*
meannesses
.
It
is
really
death
to
do
so
--
that
is
why
so
many
marriages
*NL*
turn
out
unhappily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
for
instance
,
am
a
rather
greedy
man
;
I
have
a
taste
for
good
*NL*
cookery
and
a
watering
tooth
at
the
mere
sound
of
the
names
of
certain
*NL*
comestibles
.
If
Florence
had
discovered
this
secret
of
mine
I
should
*NL*
have
found
her
knowledge
of
it
so
unbearable
that
I
never
could
have
*NL*
supported
all
the
other
privations
of
the
regime
that
she
extracted
from
*NL*
me
.
I
am
bound
to
say
that
Florence
never
discovered
this
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
she
never
alluded
to
it
;
I
dare
say
she
never
took
sufficient
*NL*
interest
in
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
secret
weakness
of
Florence
--
the
weakness
that
she
could
not
*NL*
bear
to
have
me
discover
,
was
just
that
early
escapade
with
the
fellow
*NL*
called
Jimmy
.
Let
me
,
as
this
is
in
all
probability
the
last
time
I
*NL*
shall
mention
Florence
's
name
,
dwell
a
little
upon
the
change
that
had
*NL*
taken
place
in
her
psychology
.
She
would
not
,
I
mean
,
have
minded
if
I
*NL*
had
discovered
that
she
was
the
mistress
of
Edward
Ashburnham
.
She
would
*NL*
rather
have
liked
it
.
Indeed
,
the
chief
trouble
of
poor
Leonora
in
those
*NL*
days
was
to
keep
Florence
from
making
,
before
me
,
theatrical
displays
,
*NL*
on
one
line
or
another
,
of
that
very
fact
.
She
wanted
,
in
one
mood
,
*NL*
to
come
rushing
to
me
,
to
cast
herself
on
her
knees
at
my
feet
and
to
*NL*
declaim
a
carefully
arranged
,
frightfully
emotional
,
outpouring
as
to
*NL*
her
passion
.
That
was
to
show
that
she
was
like
one
of
the
great
erotic
*NL*
women
of
whom
history
tells
us
.
In
another
mood
she
would
desire
to
come
*NL*
to
me
disdainfully
and
to
tell
me
that
I
was
considerably
less
than
a
*NL*
man
and
that
what
had
happened
was
what
must
happen
when
a
real
male
*NL*
came
along
.
She
wanted
to
say
that
in
cool
,
balanced
and
sarcastic
*NL*
sentences
.
That
was
when
she
wished
to
appear
like
the
heroine
of
a
*NL*
French
comedy
.
Because
of
course
she
was
always
play
acting
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
she
did
n't
want
me
to
know
was
the
fact
of
her
first
escapade
*NL*
with
the
fellow
called
Jimmy
.
She
had
arrived
at
figuring
out
the
sort
*NL*
of
low-down
Bowery
tough
that
that
fellow
was
.
Do
you
know
what
it
is
to
*NL*
shudder
,
in
later
life
,
for
some
small
,
stupid
action
--
usually
for
some
*NL*
small
,
quite
genuine
piece
of
emotionalism
--
of
your
early
life
?
Well
,
it
*NL*
was
that
sort
of
shuddering
that
came
over
Florence
at
the
thought
that
*NL*
she
had
surrendered
to
such
a
low
fellow
.
I
do
n't
know
that
she
need
*NL*
have
shuddered
.
It
was
her
footling
old
uncle
's
work
;
he
ought
never
to
*NL*
have
taken
those
two
round
the
world
together
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
*NL*
cabin
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
.
Anyhow
,
I
am
convinced
that
the
*NL*
sight
of
Mr
Bagshawe
and
the
thought
that
Mr
Bagshawe
--
for
she
knew
that
*NL*
unpleasant
and
toadlike
personality
--
the
thought
that
Mr
Bagshawe
would
*NL*
almost
certainly
reveal
to
me
that
he
had
caught
her
coming
out
of
*NL*
Jimmy
's
bedroom
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
the
4th
of
August
,
*NL*
1900
--
that
was
the
determining
influence
in
her
suicide
.
And
no
doubt
*NL*
the
effect
of
the
date
was
too
much
for
her
superstitious
personality
.
*NL*
She
had
been
born
on
the
4th
of
August
;
she
had
started
to
go
round
the
*NL*
world
on
the
4th
of
August
;
she
had
become
a
low
fellow
's
mistress
on
*NL*
the
4th
of
August
.
On
the
same
day
of
the
year
she
had
married
me
;
on
*NL*
that
4th
she
had
lost
Edward
's
love
,
and
Bagshawe
had
appeared
like
a
*NL*
sinister
omen
--
like
a
grin
on
the
face
of
Fate
.
It
was
the
last
straw
.
*NL*
She
ran
upstairs
,
arranged
herself
decoratively
upon
her
bed
--
she
was
a
*NL*
sweetly
pretty
woman
with
smooth
pink
and
white
cheeks
,
long
hair
,
*NL*
the
eyelashes
falling
like
a
tiny
curtain
on
her
cheeks
.
She
drank
the
*NL*
little
phial
of
prussic
acid
and
there
she
lay
.
--
Oh
,
extremely
charming
*NL*
and
clear-cut
--
looking
with
a
puzzled
expression
at
the
electric-light
*NL*
bulb
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
,
or
perhaps
through
it
,
to
the
stars
*NL*
above
.
Who
knows
?
Anyhow
,
there
was
an
end
of
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
have
no
idea
how
quite
extraordinarily
for
me
that
was
the
end
of
*NL*
Florence
.
From
that
day
to
this
I
have
never
given
her
another
thought
;
*NL*
I
have
not
bestowed
upon
her
so
much
as
a
sigh
.
Of
course
,
when
it
has
*NL*
been
necessary
to
talk
about
her
to
Leonora
,
or
when
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
these
writings
I
have
tried
to
figure
her
out
,
I
have
thought
about
her
*NL*
as
I
might
do
about
a
problem
in
algebra
.
But
it
has
always
been
as
a
*NL*
matter
for
study
,
not
for
remembrance
.
She
just
went
completely
out
of
*NL*
existence
,
like
yesterday
's
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
deadly
tired
.
And
I
dare
say
that
my
week
or
ten
days
of
*NL*
affaissement
--
of
what
was
practically
catalepsy
--
was
just
the
repose
*NL*
that
my
exhausted
nature
claimed
after
twelve
years
of
the
repression
of
*NL*
my
instincts
,
after
twelve
years
of
playing
the
trained
poodle
.
For
*NL*
that
was
all
that
I
had
been
.
I
suppose
that
it
was
the
shock
that
did
*NL*
it
--
the
several
shocks
.
But
I
am
unwilling
to
attribute
my
feelings
*NL*
at
that
time
to
anything
so
concrete
as
a
shock
.
It
was
a
feeling
so
*NL*
tranquil
.
It
was
as
if
an
immensely
heavy
--
an
unbearably
heavy
knapsack
,
*NL*
supported
upon
my
shoulders
by
straps
,
had
fallen
off
and
left
my
*NL*
shoulders
themselves
that
the
straps
had
cut
into
,
numb
and
without
*NL*
sensation
of
life
.
I
tell
you
,
I
had
no
regret
.
What
had
I
to
regret
?
*NL*
I
suppose
that
my
inner
soul
--
my
dual
personality
--
had
realized
long
*NL*
before
that
Florence
was
a
personality
of
paper
--
that
she
represented
a
*NL*
real
human
being
with
a
heart
,
with
feelings
,
with
sympathies
and
with
*NL*
emotions
only
as
a
bank-note
represents
a
certain
quantity
of
gold
.
I
*NL*
know
that
sort
of
feeling
came
to
the
surface
in
me
the
moment
the
*NL*
man
Bagshawe
told
me
that
he
had
seen
her
coming
out
of
that
fellow
's
*NL*
bedroom
.
I
thought
suddenly
that
she
was
n't
real
;
she
was
just
a
mass
*NL*
of
talk
out
of
guidebooks
,
of
drawings
out
of
fashion-plates
.
It
is
even
*NL*
possible
that
,
if
that
feeling
had
not
possessed
me
,
I
should
have
run
*NL*
up
sooner
to
her
room
and
might
have
prevented
her
drinking
the
prussic
*NL*
acid
.
But
I
just
could
n't
do
it
;
it
would
have
been
like
chasing
a
scrap
*NL*
of
paper
--
an
occupation
ignoble
for
a
grown
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
as
it
began
,
so
that
matter
has
remained
.
I
did
n't
care
whether
*NL*
she
had
come
out
of
that
bedroom
or
whether
she
had
n't
.
It
simply
did
n't
*NL*
interest
me
.
Florence
did
n't
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
you
will
retort
that
I
was
in
love
with
Nancy
Rufford
and
that
*NL*
my
indifference
was
therefore
discreditable
.
Well
,
I
am
not
seeking
to
*NL*
avoid
discredit
.
I
was
in
love
with
Nancy
Rufford
as
I
am
in
love
with
*NL*
the
poor
child
's
memory
,
quietly
and
quite
tenderly
in
my
American
sort
*NL*
of
way
.
I
had
never
thought
about
it
until
I
heard
Leonora
state
that
I
*NL*
might
now
marry
her
.
But
,
from
that
moment
until
her
worse
than
death
,
I
*NL*
do
not
suppose
that
I
much
thought
about
anything
else
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
*NL*
say
that
I
sighed
about
her
or
groaned
;
I
just
wanted
to
marry
her
as
*NL*
some
people
want
to
go
to
Carcassonne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
you
understand
the
feeling
--
the
sort
of
feeling
that
you
must
get
*NL*
certain
matters
out
of
the
way
,
smooth
out
certain
fairly
negligible
*NL*
complications
before
you
can
go
to
a
place
that
has
,
during
all
your
*NL*
life
,
been
a
sort
of
dream
city
?
I
did
n't
attach
much
importance
to
my
*NL*
superior
years
.
I
was
forty-five
,
and
she
,
poor
thing
,
was
only
just
*NL*
rising
twenty-two
.
But
she
was
older
than
her
years
and
quieter
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
have
an
odd
quality
of
sainthood
,
as
if
she
must
inevitably
*NL*
end
in
a
convent
with
a
white
coif
framing
her
face
.
But
she
had
*NL*
frequently
told
me
that
she
had
no
vocation
;
it
just
simply
was
n't
*NL*
there
--
the
desire
to
become
a
nun
.
Well
,
I
guess
that
I
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
convent
myself
;
it
seemed
fairly
proper
that
she
should
make
her
vows
to
*NL*
me
.
No
,
I
did
n't
see
any
impediment
on
the
score
of
age
.
I
dare
say
no
*NL*
man
does
and
I
was
pretty
confident
that
with
a
little
preparation
,
I
*NL*
could
make
a
young
girl
happy
.
I
could
spoil
her
as
few
young
girls
have
*NL*
ever
been
spoiled
;
and
I
could
n't
regard
myself
as
personally
repulsive
.
*NL*
No
man
can
,
or
if
he
ever
comes
to
do
so
,
that
is
the
end
of
him
.
But
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
came
out
of
my
catalepsy
,
I
seemed
to
perceive
that
my
*NL*
problem
--
that
what
I
had
to
do
to
prepare
myself
for
getting
into
*NL*
contact
with
her
,
was
just
to
get
back
into
contact
with
life
.
I
had
*NL*
been
kept
for
twelve
years
in
a
rarefied
atmosphere
;
what
I
then
had
*NL*
to
do
was
a
little
fighting
with
real
life
,
some
wrestling
with
men
*NL*
of
business
,
some
travelling
amongst
larger
cities
,
something
harsh
,
*NL*
something
masculine
.
I
did
n't
want
to
present
myself
to
Nancy
Rufford
as
*NL*
a
sort
of
an
old
maid
.
That
was
why
,
just
a
fortnight
after
Florence
's
*NL*
suicide
,
I
set
off
for
the
United
States
.
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
IMMEDIATELY
after
Florence
's
death
Leonora
began
to
put
the
leash
upon
*NL*
Nancy
Rufford
and
Edward
.
She
had
guessed
what
had
happened
under
the
*NL*
trees
near
the
Casino
.
They
stayed
at
Nauheim
some
weeks
after
I
went
,
*NL*
and
Leonora
has
told
me
that
that
was
the
most
deadly
time
of
her
*NL*
existence
.
It
seemed
like
a
long
,
silent
duel
with
invisible
weapons
,
*NL*
so
she
said
.
And
it
was
rendered
all
the
more
difficult
by
the
girl
's
*NL*
entire
innocence
.
For
Nancy
was
always
trying
to
go
off
alone
with
*NL*
Edward
--
as
she
had
been
doing
all
her
life
,
whenever
she
was
home
for
*NL*
holidays
.
She
just
wanted
him
to
say
nice
things
to
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
the
position
was
extremely
complicated
.
It
was
as
complicated
*NL*
as
it
well
could
be
,
along
delicate
lines
.
There
was
the
complication
*NL*
caused
by
the
fact
that
Edward
and
Leonora
never
spoke
to
each
other
*NL*
except
when
other
people
were
present
.
Then
,
as
I
have
said
,
their
*NL*
demeanours
were
quite
perfect
.
There
was
the
complication
caused
by
the
*NL*
girl
's
entire
innocence
;
there
was
the
further
complication
that
both
*NL*
Edward
and
Leonora
really
regarded
the
girl
as
their
daughter
.
Or
it
*NL*
might
be
more
precise
to
say
that
they
regarded
her
as
being
Leonora
's
*NL*
daughter
.
And
Nancy
was
a
queer
girl
;
it
is
very
difficult
to
describe
*NL*
her
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
tall
and
strikingly
thin
;
she
had
a
tortured
mouth
,
agonized
*NL*
eyes
,
and
a
quite
extraordinary
sense
of
fun
.
You
,
might
put
it
that
*NL*
at
times
she
was
exceedingly
grotesque
and
at
times
extraordinarily
*NL*
beautiful
.
Why
,
she
had
the
heaviest
head
of
black
hair
that
I
have
ever
*NL*
come
across
;
I
used
to
wonder
how
she
could
bear
the
weight
of
it
.
She
*NL*
was
just
over
twenty-one
and
at
times
she
seemed
as
old
as
the
hills
,
at
*NL*
times
not
much
more
than
sixteen
.
At
one
moment
she
would
be
talking
of
*NL*
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
at
the
next
she
would
be
tumbling
all
over
*NL*
the
lawn
with
the
St
Bernard
puppy
.
She
could
ride
to
hounds
like
*NL*
a
Maenad
and
she
could
sit
for
hours
perfectly
still
,
steeping
*NL*
handkerchief
after
handkerchief
in
vinegar
when
Leonora
had
one
of
her
*NL*
headaches
.
She
was
,
in
short
,
a
miracle
of
patience
who
could
be
almost
*NL*
miraculously
impatient
.
It
was
,
no
doubt
,
the
convent
training
that
*NL*
effected
that
.
I
remember
that
one
of
her
letters
to
me
,
when
she
was
*NL*
about
sixteen
,
ran
something
like
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Corpus
Christi
''
--
or
it
may
have
been
some
other
saint
's
day
,
I
*NL*
can
not
keep
these
things
in
my
head
--
``
our
school
played
Roehampton
at
*NL*
Hockey
.
And
,
seeing
that
our
side
was
losing
,
being
three
goals
to
*NL*
one
against
us
at
halftime
,
we
retired
into
the
chapel
and
prayed
for
*NL*
victory
.
We
won
by
five
goals
to
three
.
''
And
I
remember
that
she
seemed
*NL*
to
describe
afterwards
a
sort
of
saturnalia
.
Apparently
,
when
the
*NL*
victorious
fifteen
or
eleven
came
into
the
refectory
for
supper
,
the
*NL*
whole
school
jumped
upon
the
tables
and
cheered
and
broke
the
chairs
on
*NL*
the
floor
and
smashed
the
crockery
--
for
a
given
time
,
until
the
*NL*
Reverend
Mother
rang
a
hand-bell
.
That
is
of
course
the
Catholic
*NL*
tradition
--
saturnalia
that
can
end
in
a
moment
,
like
the
crack
of
a
*NL*
whip
.
I
do
n't
,
of
course
,
like
the
tradition
,
but
I
am
bound
to
say
that
*NL*
it
gave
Nancy
--
or
at
any
rate
Nancy
had
--
a
sense
of
rectitude
that
I
*NL*
have
never
seen
surpassed
.
It
was
a
thing
like
a
knife
that
looked
*NL*
out
of
her
eyes
and
that
spoke
with
her
voice
,
just
now
and
then
.
It
*NL*
positively
frightened
me
.
I
suppose
that
I
was
almost
afraid
to
be
in
a
*NL*
world
where
there
could
be
so
fine
a
standard
.
I
remember
when
she
was
*NL*
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
on
going
back
to
the
convent
I
once
gave
her
*NL*
a
couple
of
English
sovereigns
as
a
tip
.
She
thanked
me
in
a
peculiarly
*NL*
heartfelt
way
,
saying
that
it
would
come
in
extremely
handy
.
I
asked
her
*NL*
why
and
she
explained
.
There
was
a
rule
at
the
school
that
the
pupils
*NL*
were
not
to
speak
when
they
walked
through
the
garden
from
the
chapel
*NL*
to
the
refectory
.
And
,
since
this
rule
appeared
to
be
idiotic
and
*NL*
arbitrary
,
she
broke
it
on
purpose
day
after
day
.
In
the
evening
the
*NL*
children
were
all
asked
if
they
had
committed
any
faults
during
the
day
,
*NL*
and
every
evening
Nancy
confessed
that
she
had
broken
this
particular
*NL*
rule
.
It
cost
her
sixpence
a
time
,
that
being
the
fine
attached
to
the
*NL*
offence
.
Just
for
the
information
I
asked
her
why
she
always
confessed
,
*NL*
and
she
answered
in
these
exact
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
the
girls
of
the
Holy
Child
have
always
been
noted
for
their
*NL*
truthfulness
.
It
's
a
beastly
bore
,
but
I
've
got
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
dare
say
that
the
miserable
nature
of
her
childhood
,
coming
before
the
*NL*
mixture
of
saturnalia
and
discipline
that
was
her
convent
life
,
added
*NL*
something
to
her
queernesses
.
Her
father
was
a
violent
madman
of
*NL*
a
fellow
,
a
major
of
one
of
what
I
believe
are
called
the
Highland
*NL*
regiments
.
He
did
n't
drink
,
but
he
had
an
ungovernable
temper
,
and
the
*NL*
first
thing
that
Nancy
could
remember
was
seeing
her
father
strike
her
*NL*
mother
with
his
clenched
fist
so
that
her
mother
fell
over
sideways
*NL*
from
the
breakfast-table
and
lay
motionless
.
The
mother
was
no
doubt
an
*NL*
irritating
woman
and
the
privates
of
that
regiment
appeared
to
have
been
*NL*
irritating
,
too
,
so
that
the
house
was
a
place
of
outcries
and
perpetual
*NL*
disturbances
.
Mrs
Rufford
was
Leonora
's
dearest
friend
and
Leonora
*NL*
could
be
cutting
enough
at
times
.
But
I
fancy
she
was
as
nothing
to
Mrs
*NL*
Rufford
.
The
Major
would
come
in
to
lunch
harassed
and
already
spitting
*NL*
out
oaths
after
an
unsatisfactory
morning
's
drilling
of
his
stubborn
men
*NL*
beneath
a
hot
sun
.
And
then
Mrs
Rufford
would
make
some
cutting
remark
*NL*
and
pandemonium
would
break
loose
.
Once
,
when
she
had
been
about
twelve
,
*NL*
Nancy
had
tried
to
intervene
between
the
pair
of
them
.
Her
father
had
*NL*
struck
her
full
upon
the
forehead
a
blow
so
terrible
that
she
had
lain
*NL*
unconscious
for
three
days
.
Nevertheless
,
Nancy
seemed
to
prefer
her
*NL*
father
to
her
mother
.
She
remembered
rough
kindnesses
from
him
.
Once
*NL*
or
twice
when
she
had
been
quite
small
he
had
dressed
her
in
a
clumsy
,
*NL*
impatient
,
but
very
tender
way
.
It
was
nearly
always
impossible
to
get
*NL*
a
servant
to
stay
in
the
family
and
,
for
days
at
a
time
,
apparently
,
Mrs
*NL*
Rufford
would
be
incapable
.
I
fancy
she
drank
.
At
any
rate
,
she
had
so
*NL*
cutting
a
tongue
that
even
Nancy
was
afraid
of
her
--
she
so
made
fun
of
*NL*
any
tenderness
,
she
so
sneered
at
all
emotional
displays
.
Nancy
must
*NL*
have
been
a
very
emotional
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
one
day
,
quite
suddenly
,
on
her
return
from
a
ride
at
Fort
William
,
*NL*
Nancy
had
been
sent
,
with
her
governess
,
who
had
a
white
face
,
right
*NL*
down
South
to
that
convent
school
.
She
had
been
expecting
to
go
there
in
*NL*
two
months
'
time
.
Her
mother
disappeared
from
her
life
at
that
time
.
A
*NL*
fortnight
later
Leonora
came
to
the
convent
and
told
her
that
her
mother
*NL*
was
dead
.
Perhaps
she
was
.
At
any
rate
,
I
never
heard
until
the
very
end
*NL*
what
became
of
Mrs
Rufford
.
Leonora
never
spoke
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Major
Rufford
went
to
India
,
from
which
he
returned
very
seldom
*NL*
and
only
for
very
short
visits
;
and
Nancy
lived
herself
gradually
into
*NL*
the
life
at
Branshaw
Teleragh
.
I
think
that
,
from
that
time
onwards
,
she
*NL*
led
a
very
happy
life
,
till
the
end
.
There
were
dogs
and
horses
and
old
*NL*
servants
and
the
Forest
.
And
there
were
Edward
and
Leonora
,
who
loved
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
known
her
all
the
time
--
I
mean
,
that
she
always
came
to
the
*NL*
Ashburnhams
'
at
Nauheim
for
the
last
fortnight
of
their
stay
--
and
I
*NL*
watched
her
gradually
growing
.
She
was
very
cheerful
with
me
.
She
always
*NL*
even
kissed
me
,
night
and
morning
,
until
she
was
about
eighteen
.
And
she
*NL*
would
skip
about
and
fetch
me
things
and
laugh
at
my
tales
of
life
in
*NL*
Philadelphia
.
But
,
beneath
her
gaiety
,
I
fancy
that
there
lurked
some
*NL*
terrors
.
I
remember
one
day
,
when
she
was
just
eighteen
,
during
one
of
*NL*
her
father
's
rare
visits
to
Europe
,
we
were
sitting
in
the
gardens
,
near
*NL*
the
iron-stained
fountain
.
Leonora
had
one
of
her
headaches
and
we
were
*NL*
waiting
for
Florence
and
Edward
to
come
from
their
baths
.
You
have
no
*NL*
idea
how
beautiful
Nancy
looked
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
talking
about
the
desirability
of
taking
tickets
in
*NL*
lotteries
--
of
the
moral
side
of
it
,
I
mean
.
She
was
all
in
white
,
and
*NL*
so
tall
and
fragile
;
and
she
had
only
just
put
her
hair
up
,
so
that
*NL*
the
carriage
of
her
neck
had
that
charming
touch
of
youth
and
of
*NL*
unfamiliarity
.
Over
her
throat
there
played
the
reflection
from
a
little
*NL*
pool
of
water
,
left
by
a
thunderstorm
of
the
night
before
,
and
all
the
*NL*
rest
of
her
features
were
in
the
diffused
and
luminous
shade
of
her
*NL*
white
parasol
.
Her
dark
hair
just
showed
beneath
her
broad
,
white
hat
*NL*
of
pierced
,
chip
straw
;
her
throat
was
very
long
and
leaned
forward
,
and
*NL*
her
eyebrows
,
arching
a
little
as
she
laughed
at
some
old-fashionedness
*NL*
in
my
phraseology
,
had
abandoned
their
tense
line
.
And
there
was
a
*NL*
little
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
light
in
her
deep
blue
eyes
.
And
to
*NL*
think
that
that
vivid
white
thing
,
that
saintly
and
swanlike
being
--
to
*NL*
think
that
...
Why
,
she
was
like
the
sail
of
a
ship
,
so
white
and
so
*NL*
definite
in
her
movements
.
And
to
think
that
she
will
never
...
Why
,
she
*NL*
will
never
do
anything
again
.
I
ca
n't
believe
it
...
*NL*
*NL*
Anyhow
,
we
were
chattering
away
about
the
morality
of
lotteries
.
And
*NL*
then
,
suddenly
,
there
came
from
the
arcades
behind
us
the
overtones
of
*NL*
her
father
's
unmistakable
voice
;
it
was
as
if
a
modified
foghorn
had
*NL*
boomed
with
a
reed
inside
it
.
I
looked
round
to
catch
sight
of
him
.
A
*NL*
tall
,
fair
,
stiffly
upright
man
of
fifty
,
he
was
walking
away
with
an
*NL*
Italian
baron
who
had
had
much
to
do
with
the
Belgian
Congo
.
They
must
*NL*
have
been
talking
about
the
proper
treatment
of
natives
,
for
I
heard
him
*NL*
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hang
humanity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
looked
again
at
Nancy
her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
face
was
more
*NL*
pallid
than
her
dress
,
which
had
at
least
some
pinkish
reflections
from
*NL*
the
gravel
.
It
was
dreadful
to
see
her
with
her
eyes
closed
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
and
her
hand
that
had
appeared
to
be
groping
,
*NL*
settled
for
a
moment
on
my
arm
.
``
Never
speak
of
it
.
Promise
never
to
*NL*
tell
my
father
of
it
.
It
brings
back
those
dreadful
dreams
...
''
And
,
when
*NL*
she
opened
her
eyes
she
looked
straight
into
mine
.
``
The
blessed
saints
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
``
you
would
think
they
would
spare
you
such
things
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
all
the
sinning
in
the
world
could
make
one
deserve
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
say
the
poor
thing
was
always
allowed
a
light
at
night
,
even
in
her
*NL*
bedroom
...
And
yet
,
no
young
girl
could
more
archly
and
lovingly
have
*NL*
played
with
an
adored
father
.
She
was
always
holding
him
by
both
coat
*NL*
lapels
;
cross-questioning
him
as
to
how
he
spent
his
time
;
kissing
the
*NL*
top
of
his
head
.
Ah
,
she
was
well-bred
,
if
ever
anyone
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
,
wretched
man
cringed
before
her
--
but
she
could
not
have
done
*NL*
more
to
put
him
at
his
ease
.
Perhaps
she
had
had
lessons
in
it
at
her
*NL*
convent
.
It
was
only
that
peculiar
note
of
his
voice
,
used
when
he
was
*NL*
overbearing
or
dogmatic
,
that
could
unman
her
--
and
that
was
only
visible
*NL*
when
it
came
unexpectedly
.
That
was
because
the
bad
dreams
that
the
*NL*
blessed
saints
allowed
her
to
have
for
her
sins
always
seemed
to
her
*NL*
to
herald
themselves
by
the
booming
sound
of
her
father
's
voice
.
It
*NL*
was
that
sound
that
had
always
preceded
his
entrance
for
the
terrible
*NL*
lunches
of
her
childhood
...
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
reported
,
earlier
in
this
chapter
,
that
Leonora
said
,
during
that
*NL*
remainder
of
their
stay
at
Nauheim
,
after
I
had
left
,
it
had
seemed
to
*NL*
her
that
she
was
fighting
a
long
duel
with
unseen
weapons
against
silent
*NL*
adversaries
.
Nancy
,
as
I
have
also
said
,
was
always
trying
to
go
off
*NL*
with
Edward
alone
.
That
had
been
her
habit
for
years
.
And
Leonora
found
*NL*
it
to
be
her
duty
to
stop
that
.
It
was
very
difficult
.
Nancy
was
used
*NL*
to
having
her
own
way
,
and
for
years
she
had
been
used
to
going
off
*NL*
with
Edward
,
ratting
,
rabbiting
,
catching
salmon
down
at
Fordingbridge
,
*NL*
district-visiting
of
the
sort
that
Edward
indulged
in
,
or
calling
on
the
*NL*
tenants
.
And
at
Nauheim
she
and
Edward
had
always
gone
up
to
the
Casino
*NL*
alone
in
the
evenings
--
at
any
rate
,
whenever
Florence
did
not
call
for
*NL*
his
attendance
.
It
shows
the
obviously
innocent
nature
of
the
regard
of
*NL*
those
two
that
even
Florence
had
never
had
any
idea
of
jealousy
.
Leonora
*NL*
had
cultivated
the
habit
of
going
to
bed
at
ten
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
how
she
managed
it
,
but
,
for
all
the
time
they
were
at
*NL*
Nauheim
,
she
contrived
never
to
let
those
two
be
alone
together
,
except
*NL*
in
broad
daylight
,
in
very
crowded
places
.
If
a
Protestant
had
done
that
*NL*
it
would
no
doubt
have
awakened
a
self-consciousness
in
the
girl
.
But
*NL*
Catholics
,
who
have
always
reservations
and
queer
spots
of
secrecy
,
can
*NL*
manage
these
things
better
.
And
I
dare
say
that
two
things
made
this
*NL*
easier
--
the
death
of
Florence
and
the
fact
that
Edward
was
obviously
*NL*
sickening
.
He
appeared
,
indeed
,
to
be
very
ill
;
his
shoulders
began
*NL*
to
be
bowed
;
there
were
pockets
under
his
eyes
;
he
had
extraordinary
*NL*
moments
of
inattention
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Leonora
describes
herself
as
watching
him
as
a
fierce
cat
watches
an
*NL*
unconscious
pigeon
in
a
roadway
.
In
that
silent
watching
,
again
,
I
think
*NL*
she
was
a
Catholic
--
of
a
people
that
can
think
thoughts
alien
to
ours
*NL*
and
keep
them
to
themselves
.
And
the
thoughts
passed
through
her
mind
;
*NL*
some
of
them
even
got
through
to
Edward
with
never
a
word
spoken
.
At
*NL*
first
she
thought
that
it
might
be
remorse
,
or
grief
,
for
the
death
*NL*
of
Florence
that
was
oppressing
him
.
But
she
watched
and
watched
,
and
*NL*
uttered
apparently
random
sentences
about
Florence
before
the
girl
,
and
*NL*
she
perceived
that
he
had
no
grief
and
no
remorse
.
He
had
not
any
idea
*NL*
that
Florence
could
have
committed
suicide
without
writing
at
least
a
*NL*
tirade
to
him
.
The
absence
of
that
made
him
certain
that
it
had
been
*NL*
heart
disease
.
For
Florence
had
never
undeceived
him
on
that
point
.
She
*NL*
thought
it
made
her
seem
more
romantic
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
Edward
had
no
remorse
.
He
was
able
to
say
to
himself
that
he
had
*NL*
treated
Florence
with
gallant
attentiveness
of
the
kind
that
she
desired
*NL*
until
two
hours
before
her
death
.
Leonora
gathered
that
from
the
look
in
*NL*
his
eyes
,
and
from
the
way
he
straightened
his
shoulders
over
her
as
*NL*
she
lay
in
her
coffin
--
from
that
and
a
thousand
other
little
things
.
She
*NL*
would
speak
suddenly
about
Florence
to
the
girl
and
he
would
not
start
*NL*
in
the
least
;
he
would
not
even
pay
attention
,
but
would
sit
with
*NL*
bloodshot
eyes
gazing
at
the
tablecloth
.
He
drank
a
good
deal
,
at
that
*NL*
time
--
a
steady
soaking
of
drink
every
evening
till
long
after
they
had
*NL*
gone
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Leonora
made
the
girl
go
to
bed
at
ten
,
unreasonable
though
that
*NL*
seemed
to
Nancy
.
She
would
understand
that
,
whilst
they
were
in
a
*NL*
sort
of
half
mourning
for
Florence
,
she
ought
not
to
be
seen
at
public
*NL*
places
,
like
the
Casino
;
but
she
could
not
see
why
she
should
not
*NL*
accompany
her
uncle
upon
his
evening
strolls
though
the
park
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
Leonora
put
up
as
an
excuse
--
something
,
I
fancy
,
in
the
nature
*NL*
of
a
nightly
orison
that
she
made
the
girl
and
herself
perform
for
the
*NL*
soul
of
Florence
.
And
then
,
one
evening
,
about
a
fortnight
later
,
when
*NL*
the
girl
,
growing
restive
at
even
devotional
exercises
,
clamoured
once
*NL*
more
to
be
allowed
to
go
for
a
walk
with
Edward
,
and
when
Leonora
was
*NL*
really
at
her
wits
'
end
,
Edward
gave
himself
into
her
hands
.
He
was
just
*NL*
standing
up
from
dinner
and
had
his
face
averted
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
turned
his
heavy
head
and
his
bloodshot
eyes
upon
his
wife
and
*NL*
looked
full
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
von
Hauptmann
,
''
he
said
,
``
has
ordered
me
to
go
to
bed
*NL*
immediately
after
dinner
.
My
heart
's
much
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
look
at
Leonora
for
a
long
minute
--
with
a
sort
of
heavy
*NL*
contempt
.
And
Leonora
understood
that
,
with
his
speech
,
he
was
giving
*NL*
her
the
excuse
that
she
needed
for
separating
him
from
the
girl
,
and
*NL*
with
his
eyes
he
was
reproaching
her
for
thinking
that
he
would
try
to
*NL*
corrupt
Nancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
silently
up
to
his
room
and
sat
there
for
a
long
time
--
until
*NL*
the
girl
was
well
in
bed
--
reading
in
the
Anglican
prayer-book
.
And
about
*NL*
half-past
ten
she
heard
his
footsteps
pass
her
door
,
going
outwards
.
Two
*NL*
and
a
half
hours
later
they
came
back
,
stumbling
heavily
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
,
reflecting
upon
this
position
until
the
last
night
of
*NL*
their
stay
at
Nauheim
.
Then
she
suddenly
acted
.
For
,
just
in
the
same
*NL*
way
,
suddenly
after
dinner
,
she
looked
at
him
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Teddy
,
do
n't
you
think
you
could
take
a
night
off
from
your
doctor
's
*NL*
orders
and
go
with
Nancy
to
the
Casino
.
The
poor
child
has
had
her
visit
*NL*
so
spoiled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
in
turn
for
a
long
,
balancing
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
jumped
out
of
her
chair
and
kissed
him
.
Those
two
words
,
Leonora
*NL*
said
,
gave
her
the
greatest
relief
of
any
two
syllables
she
had
ever
*NL*
heard
in
her
life
.
For
she
realized
that
Edward
was
breaking
up
,
not
*NL*
under
the
desire
for
possession
,
but
from
the
dogged
determination
to
*NL*
hold
his
hand
.
She
could
relax
some
of
her
vigilance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
she
sat
in
the
darkness
behind
her
half-closed
jalousies
,
*NL*
looking
over
the
street
and
the
night
and
the
trees
until
,
very
late
,
*NL*
she
could
hear
Nancy
's
clear
voice
coming
closer
and
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
look
an
old
guy
with
that
false
nose
.
''
There
had
been
some
sort
*NL*
of
celebration
of
a
local
holiday
up
in
the
Kursaal
.
And
Edward
replied
*NL*
with
his
sort
of
sulky
good
nature
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
you
,
you
looked
like
old
Mother
Sideacher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
came
swinging
along
,
a
silhouette
beneath
a
gas-lamp
;
Edward
,
*NL*
another
,
slouched
at
her
side
.
They
were
talking
just
as
they
had
talked
*NL*
any
time
since
the
girl
had
been
seventeen
;
with
the
same
tones
,
the
*NL*
same
joke
about
an
old
beggar
woman
who
always
amused
them
at
Branshaw
.
*NL*
The
girl
,
a
little
later
,
opened
Leonora
's
door
whilst
she
was
still
*NL*
kissing
Edward
on
the
forehead
as
she
had
done
every
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
had
a
most
glorious
time
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
's
ever
so
much
better
.
*NL*
He
raced
me
for
twenty
yards
home
.
Why
are
you
all
in
the
dark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
could
hear
Edward
going
about
in
his
room
,
but
,
owing
to
the
*NL*
girl
's
chatter
,
she
could
not
tell
whether
he
went
out
again
or
not
.
*NL*
And
then
,
very
much
later
,
because
she
thought
that
if
he
were
drinking
*NL*
again
something
must
be
done
to
stop
it
,
she
opened
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
and
very
softly
,
the
never-opened
door
between
their
rooms
.
She
wanted
*NL*
to
see
if
he
had
gone
out
again
.
Edward
was
kneeling
beside
his
bed
with
*NL*
his
head
hidden
in
the
counterpane
.
His
arms
,
outstretched
,
held
out
*NL*
before
him
a
little
image
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
--
a
tawdry
,
scarlet
and
*NL*
Prussian
blue
affair
that
the
girl
had
given
him
on
her
first
return
*NL*
from
the
convent
.
His
shoulders
heaved
convulsively
three
times
,
and
*NL*
heavy
sobs
came
from
him
before
she
could
close
the
door
.
He
was
not
a
*NL*
Catholic
;
but
that
was
the
way
it
took
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
slept
for
the
first
time
that
night
with
a
sleep
from
which
she
*NL*
never
once
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
AND
then
Leonora
completely
broke
down
--
on
the
day
that
they
returned
*NL*
to
Branshaw
Teleragh
.
It
is
the
infliction
of
our
miserable
minds
--
it
is
*NL*
the
scourge
of
atrocious
but
probably
just
destiny
that
no
grief
comes
*NL*
by
itself
.
No
,
any
great
grief
,
though
the
grief
itself
may
have
gone
,
*NL*
leaves
in
its
place
a
train
of
horrors
,
of
misery
,
and
despair
.
For
*NL*
Leonora
was
,
in
herself
,
relieved
.
She
felt
that
she
could
trust
Edward
*NL*
with
the
girl
and
she
knew
that
Nancy
could
be
absolutely
trusted
.
And
*NL*
then
,
with
the
slackening
of
her
vigilance
,
came
the
slackening
of
*NL*
her
entire
mind
.
This
is
perhaps
the
most
miserable
part
of
the
entire
*NL*
story
.
For
it
is
miserable
to
see
a
clean
intelligence
waver
;
and
*NL*
Leonora
wavered
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
to
understand
that
Leonora
loved
Edward
with
a
passion
that
was
*NL*
yet
like
an
agony
of
hatred
.
And
she
had
lived
with
him
for
years
and
*NL*
years
without
addressing
to
him
one
word
of
tenderness
.
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
she
could
do
it
.
At
the
beginning
of
that
relationship
she
had
been
*NL*
just
married
off
to
him
.
She
had
been
one
of
seven
daughters
in
a
bare
,
*NL*
untidy
Irish
manor-house
to
which
she
had
returned
from
the
convent
I
*NL*
have
so
often
spoken
of
.
She
had
left
it
just
a
year
and
she
was
just
*NL*
nineteen
.
It
is
impossible
to
imagine
such
inexperience
as
was
hers
.
*NL*
You
might
almost
say
that
she
had
never
spoken
to
a
man
except
a
priest
.
*NL*
Coming
straight
from
the
convent
,
she
had
gone
in
behind
the
high
walls
*NL*
of
the
manor-house
that
was
almost
more
cloistral
than
any
convent
could
*NL*
have
been
.
There
were
the
seven
girls
,
there
was
the
strained
mother
,
*NL*
there
was
the
worried
father
at
whom
,
three
times
in
the
course
of
that
*NL*
year
,
the
tenants
took
pot-shots
from
behind
a
hedge
.
The
women-folk
,
*NL*
upon
the
whole
,
the
tenants
respected
.
Once
a
week
each
of
the
girls
,
*NL*
since
there
were
seven
of
them
,
took
a
drive
with
the
mother
in
the
old
*NL*
basketwork
chaise
drawn
by
a
very
fat
,
very
lumbering
pony
.
They
paid
*NL*
occasionally
a
call
,
but
even
these
were
so
rare
that
,
Leonora
has
*NL*
assured
me
,
only
three
times
in
the
year
that
succeeded
her
coming
home
*NL*
from
the
convent
did
she
enter
another
person
's
house
.
For
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
time
the
seven
sisters
ran
about
in
the
neglected
gardens
between
*NL*
the
unpruned
espaliers
.
Or
they
played
lawn-tennis
or
fives
in
an
angle
*NL*
of
a
great
wall
that
surrounded
the
garden
--
an
angle
from
which
the
*NL*
fruit
trees
had
long
died
away
.
They
painted
in
water-colour
;
they
*NL*
embroidered
;
they
copied
verses
into
albums
.
Once
a
week
they
went
to
*NL*
Mass
;
once
a
week
to
the
confessional
,
accompanied
by
an
old
nurse
.
They
*NL*
were
happy
since
they
had
known
no
other
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
to
them
a
singular
extravagance
when
,
one
day
,
a
*NL*
photographer
was
brought
over
from
the
county
town
and
photographed
them
*NL*
standing
,
all
seven
,
in
the
shadow
of
an
old
apple
tree
with
the
grey
*NL*
lichen
on
the
raddled
trunk
.
But
it
was
n't
an
extravagance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
weeks
before
Colonel
Powys
had
written
to
Colonel
Ashburnham
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Harry
,
could
n't
your
Edward
marry
one
of
my
girls
?
It
would
be
*NL*
a
god-send
to
me
,
for
I
'm
at
the
end
of
my
tether
and
,
once
one
girl
*NL*
begins
to
go
off
,
the
rest
of
them
will
follow
.
''
He
went
on
to
say
that
*NL*
all
his
daughters
were
tall
,
upstanding
,
clean-limbed
and
absolutely
*NL*
pure
,
and
he
reminded
Colonel
Ashburnham
that
,
they
having
been
married
*NL*
on
the
same
day
,
though
in
different
churches
,
since
the
one
was
a
*NL*
Catholic
and
the
other
an
Anglican
--
they
had
said
to
each
other
,
the
*NL*
night
before
,
that
,
when
the
time
came
,
one
of
their
sons
should
marry
*NL*
one
of
their
daughters
.
Mrs
Ashburnham
had
been
a
Powys
and
remained
*NL*
Mrs
Powys
'
dearest
friend
.
They
had
drifted
about
the
world
as
English
*NL*
soldiers
do
,
seldom
meeting
,
but
their
women
always
in
correspondence
*NL*
one
with
another
.
They
wrote
about
minute
things
such
as
the
teething
of
*NL*
Edward
and
of
the
earlier
daughters
or
the
best
way
to
repair
a
Jacob
's
*NL*
ladder
in
a
stocking
.
And
,
if
they
met
seldom
,
yet
it
was
often
enough
*NL*
to
keep
each
other
's
personalities
fresh
in
their
minds
,
gradually
*NL*
growing
a
little
stiff
in
the
joints
,
but
always
with
enough
to
talk
*NL*
about
and
with
a
store
of
reminiscences
.
Then
,
as
his
girls
began
*NL*
to
come
of
age
when
they
must
leave
the
convent
in
which
they
were
*NL*
regularly
interned
during
his
years
of
active
service
,
Colonel
Powys
*NL*
retired
from
the
army
with
the
necessity
of
making
a
home
for
them
.
It
*NL*
happened
that
the
Ashburnhams
had
never
seen
any
of
the
Powys
girls
,
*NL*
though
,
whenever
the
four
parents
met
in
London
,
Edward
Ashburnham
was
*NL*
always
of
the
party
.
He
was
at
that
time
twenty-two
and
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
almost
as
pure
in
mind
as
Leonora
herself
.
It
is
odd
how
a
boy
can
have
*NL*
his
virgin
intelligence
untouched
in
this
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
partly
due
to
the
careful
handling
of
his
mother
,
partly
to
the
*NL*
fact
that
the
house
to
which
he
went
at
Winchester
had
a
particularly
*NL*
pure
tone
and
partly
to
Edward
's
own
peculiar
aversion
from
anything
*NL*
like
coarse
language
or
gross
stories
.
At
Sandhurst
he
had
just
kept
*NL*
out
of
the
way
of
that
sort
of
thing
.
He
was
keen
on
soldiering
,
keen
on
*NL*
mathematics
,
on
land-surveying
,
on
politics
and
,
by
a
queer
warp
of
his
*NL*
mind
,
on
literature
.
Even
when
he
was
twenty-two
he
would
pass
hours
*NL*
reading
one
of
Scott
's
novels
or
the
Chronicles
of
Froissart
.
Mrs
*NL*
Ashburnham
considered
that
she
was
to
be
congratulated
,
and
almost
every
*NL*
week
she
wrote
to
Mrs
Powys
,
dilating
upon
her
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
one
day
,
taking
a
walk
down
Bond
Street
with
her
son
,
after
having
*NL*
been
at
Lord
's
,
she
noticed
Edward
suddenly
turn
his
head
round
to
take
*NL*
a
second
look
at
a
well-dressed
girl
who
had
passed
them
.
She
wrote
*NL*
about
that
,
too
,
to
Mrs
Powys
,
and
expressed
some
alarm
.
It
had
been
,
*NL*
on
Edward
's
part
,
the
merest
reflex
action
.
He
was
so
very
abstracted
at
*NL*
that
time
owing
to
the
pressure
his
crammer
was
putting
upon
him
that
he
*NL*
certainly
had
n't
known
what
he
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
letter
of
Mrs
Ashburnham
's
to
Mrs
Powys
that
had
caused
*NL*
the
letter
from
Colonel
Powys
to
Colonel
Ashburnham
--
a
letter
that
was
*NL*
half-humorous
,
half
longing
.
Mrs
Ashburnham
caused
her
husband
to
*NL*
reply
,
with
a
letter
a
little
more
jocular
--
something
to
the
effect
*NL*
that
Colonel
Powys
ought
to
give
them
some
idea
of
the
goods
that
he
*NL*
was
marketing
.
That
was
the
cause
of
the
photograph
.
I
have
seen
it
,
the
*NL*
seven
girls
,
all
in
white
dresses
,
all
very
much
alike
in
feature
--
all
,
*NL*
except
Leonora
,
a
little
heavy
about
the
chins
and
a
little
stupid
about
*NL*
the
eyes
.
I
dare
say
it
would
have
made
Leonora
,
too
,
look
a
little
*NL*
heavy
and
a
little
stupid
,
for
it
was
not
a
good
photograph
.
But
the
*NL*
black
shadow
from
one
of
the
branches
of
the
apple
tree
cut
right
*NL*
across
her
face
,
which
is
all
but
invisible
.
There
followed
an
extremely
*NL*
harassing
time
for
Colonel
and
Mrs
Powys
.
Mrs
Ashburnham
had
written
*NL*
to
say
that
,
quite
sincerely
,
nothing
would
give
greater
ease
to
*NL*
her
maternal
anxieties
than
to
have
her
son
marry
one
of
Mrs
Powys
'
*NL*
daughters
if
only
he
showed
some
inclination
to
do
so
.
For
,
she
added
,
*NL*
nothing
but
a
love-match
was
to
be
thought
of
in
her
Edward
's
case
.
*NL*
But
the
poor
Powys
couple
had
to
run
things
so
very
fine
that
even
the
*NL*
bringing
together
of
the
young
people
was
a
desperate
hazard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mere
expenditure
upon
sending
one
of
the
girls
over
from
Ireland
to
*NL*
Branshaw
was
terrifying
to
them
;
and
whichever
girl
they
selected
might
*NL*
not
be
the
one
to
ring
Edward
's
bell
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
expenditure
*NL*
upon
mere
food
and
extra
sheets
for
a
visit
from
the
Ashburnhams
to
them
*NL*
was
terrifying
,
too
.
It
would
mean
,
mathematically
,
going
short
in
so
*NL*
many
meals
themselves
,
afterwards
.
Nevertheless
,
they
chanced
it
,
and
*NL*
all
the
three
Ashburnhams
came
on
a
visit
to
the
lonely
manor-house
.
*NL*
They
could
give
Edward
some
rough
shooting
,
some
rough
fishing
and
*NL*
a
whirl
of
femininity
;
but
I
should
say
the
girls
made
really
more
*NL*
impression
upon
Mrs
Ashburnham
than
upon
Edward
himself
.
They
appeared
*NL*
to
her
to
be
so
clean
run
and
so
safe
.
They
were
indeed
so
clean
run
*NL*
that
,
in
a
faint
sort
of
way
,
Edward
seems
to
have
regarded
them
rather
*NL*
as
boys
than
as
girls
.
And
then
,
one
evening
,
Mrs
Ashburnham
had
with
*NL*
her
boy
one
of
those
conversations
that
English
mothers
have
with
*NL*
English
sons
.
It
seems
to
have
been
a
criminal
sort
of
proceeding
,
*NL*
though
I
do
n't
know
what
took
place
at
it
.
Anyhow
,
next
morning
Colonel
*NL*
Ashburnham
asked
on
behalf
of
his
son
for
the
hand
of
Leonora
.
This
*NL*
caused
some
consternation
to
the
Powys
couple
,
since
Leonora
was
the
*NL*
third
daughter
and
Edward
ought
to
have
married
the
eldest
.
Mrs
Powys
,
*NL*
with
her
rigid
sense
of
the
proprieties
,
almost
wished
to
reject
the
*NL*
proposal
.
But
the
Colonel
,
her
husband
,
pointed
out
that
the
visit
would
*NL*
have
cost
them
sixty
pounds
,
what
with
the
hire
of
an
extra
servant
,
*NL*
of
a
horse
and
car
,
and
with
the
purchase
of
beds
and
bedding
and
extra
*NL*
tablecloths
.
There
was
nothing
else
for
it
but
the
marriage
.
In
that
way
*NL*
Edward
and
Leonora
became
man
and
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
that
a
very
minute
study
of
their
progress
towards
complete
*NL*
disunion
is
necessary
.
Perhaps
it
is
.
But
there
are
many
things
that
*NL*
I
can
not
well
make
out
,
about
which
I
can
not
well
question
Leonora
,
or
*NL*
about
which
Edward
did
not
tell
me
.
I
do
not
know
that
there
was
ever
*NL*
any
question
of
love
from
Edward
to
her
.
He
regarded
her
,
certainly
,
as
*NL*
desirable
amongst
her
sisters
.
He
was
obstinate
to
the
extent
of
saying
*NL*
that
if
he
could
not
have
her
he
would
not
have
any
of
them
.
And
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
before
the
marriage
,
he
made
her
pretty
speeches
out
of
books
*NL*
that
he
had
read
.
But
,
as
far
as
he
could
describe
his
feelings
at
all
,
*NL*
later
,
it
seems
that
,
calmly
and
without
any
quickening
of
the
pulse
,
he
*NL*
just
carried
the
girl
off
,
there
being
no
opposition
.
It
had
,
however
,
*NL*
been
all
so
long
ago
that
it
seemed
to
him
,
at
the
end
of
his
poor
life
,
*NL*
a
dim
and
misty
affair
.
He
had
the
greatest
admiration
for
Leonora
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
the
very
greatest
admiration
.
He
admired
her
for
her
*NL*
truthfulness
,
for
her
cleanness
of
mind
,
and
the
clean-run-ness
of
her
*NL*
limbs
,
for
her
efficiency
,
for
the
fairness
of
her
skin
,
for
the
gold
of
*NL*
her
hair
,
for
her
religion
,
for
her
sense
of
duty
.
It
was
a
satisfaction
*NL*
to
take
her
about
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
not
for
him
a
touch
of
magnetism
.
I
suppose
,
really
,
he
did
*NL*
not
love
her
because
she
was
never
mournful
;
what
really
made
him
*NL*
feel
good
in
life
was
to
comfort
somebody
who
would
be
darkly
and
*NL*
mysteriously
mournful
.
That
he
had
never
had
to
do
for
Leonora
.
Perhaps
,
*NL*
also
,
she
was
at
first
too
obedient
.
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
she
was
*NL*
submissive
--
that
she
deferred
,
in
her
judgements
,
to
his
.
She
did
not
.
*NL*
But
she
had
been
handed
over
to
him
,
like
some
patient
medieval
virgin
;
*NL*
she
had
been
taught
all
her
life
that
the
first
duty
of
a
woman
is
to
*NL*
obey
.
And
there
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
,
at
least
,
admiration
for
his
qualities
very
soon
became
love
of
*NL*
the
deepest
description
.
If
his
pulses
never
quickened
she
,
so
I
have
*NL*
been
told
,
became
what
is
called
an
altered
being
when
he
approached
her
*NL*
from
the
other
side
of
a
dancing-floor
.
Her
eyes
followed
him
about
full
*NL*
of
trustfulness
,
of
admiration
,
of
gratitude
,
and
of
love
.
He
was
also
,
*NL*
in
a
great
sense
,
her
pastor
and
guide
--
and
he
guided
her
into
what
,
*NL*
for
a
girl
straight
out
of
a
convent
,
was
almost
heaven
.
I
have
not
the
*NL*
least
idea
of
what
an
English
officer
's
wife
's
existence
may
be
like
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
,
there
were
feasts
,
and
chatterings
,
and
nice
men
who
gave
her
*NL*
the
right
sort
of
admiration
,
and
nice
women
who
treated
her
as
if
she
*NL*
had
been
a
baby
.
And
her
confessor
approved
of
her
life
,
and
Edward
let
*NL*
her
give
little
treats
to
the
girls
of
the
convent
she
had
left
,
and
*NL*
the
Reverend
Mother
approved
of
him
.
There
could
not
have
been
a
happier
*NL*
girl
for
five
or
six
years
.
For
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
that
time
*NL*
that
clouds
began
,
as
the
saying
is
,
to
arise
.
She
was
then
about
*NL*
twenty-three
,
and
her
purposeful
efficiency
made
her
perhaps
have
a
*NL*
desire
for
mastery
.
She
began
to
perceive
that
Edward
was
extravagant
in
*NL*
his
largesses
.
His
parents
died
just
about
that
time
,
and
Edward
,
though
*NL*
they
both
decided
that
he
should
continue
his
soldiering
,
gave
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
attention
to
the
management
of
Branshaw
through
a
steward
.
*NL*
Aldershot
was
not
very
far
away
,
and
they
spent
all
his
leaves
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
suddenly
,
she
seemed
to
begin
to
perceive
that
his
generosities
*NL*
were
almost
fantastic
.
He
subscribed
much
too
much
to
things
connected
*NL*
with
his
mess
,
he
pensioned
off
his
father
's
servants
,
old
or
new
,
much
*NL*
too
generously
.
They
had
a
large
income
,
but
every
now
and
then
they
*NL*
would
find
themselves
hard
up
.
He
began
to
talk
of
mortgaging
a
farm
or
*NL*
two
,
though
it
never
actually
came
to
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
tentative
efforts
at
remonstrating
with
him
.
Her
father
,
whom
*NL*
she
saw
now
and
then
,
said
that
Edward
was
much
too
generous
to
his
*NL*
tenants
;
the
wives
of
his
brother
officers
remonstrated
with
her
in
*NL*
private
;
his
large
subscriptions
made
it
difficult
for
their
husbands
*NL*
to
keep
up
with
them
.
Ironically
enough
,
the
first
real
trouble
between
*NL*
them
came
from
his
desire
to
build
a
Roman
Catholic
chapel
at
Branshaw
.
*NL*
He
wanted
to
do
it
to
honour
Leonora
,
and
he
proposed
to
do
it
very
*NL*
expensively
.
Leonora
did
not
want
it
;
she
could
perfectly
well
drive
*NL*
from
Branshaw
to
the
nearest
Catholic
Church
as
often
as
she
liked
.
*NL*
There
were
no
Roman
Catholic
tenants
and
no
Roman
Catholic
servants
*NL*
except
her
old
nurse
who
could
always
drive
with
her
.
She
had
as
many
*NL*
priests
to
stay
with
her
as
could
be
needed
--
and
even
the
priests
did
*NL*
not
want
a
gorgeous
chapel
in
that
place
where
it
would
have
merely
*NL*
seemed
an
invidious
instance
of
ostentation
.
They
were
perfectly
*NL*
ready
to
celebrate
Mass
for
Leonora
and
her
nurse
,
when
they
stayed
at
*NL*
Branshaw
,
in
a
cleaned-up
outhouse
.
But
Edward
was
as
obstinate
as
a
hog
*NL*
about
it
.
He
was
truly
grieved
at
his
wife
's
want
of
sentiment
--
at
her
*NL*
refusal
to
receive
that
amount
of
public
homage
from
him
.
She
appeared
*NL*
to
him
to
be
wanting
in
imagination
--
to
be
cold
and
hard
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
exactly
know
what
part
her
priests
played
in
the
tragedy
that
it
all
*NL*
became
;
I
dare
say
they
behaved
quite
creditably
but
mistakenly
.
But
*NL*
then
,
who
would
not
have
been
mistaken
with
Edward
?
I
believe
he
was
*NL*
even
hurt
that
Leonora
's
confessor
did
not
make
strenuous
efforts
to
*NL*
convert
him
.
There
was
a
period
when
he
was
quite
ready
to
become
an
*NL*
emotional
Catholic
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
why
they
did
not
take
him
on
the
hop
;
but
they
have
queer
*NL*
sorts
of
wisdoms
,
those
people
,
and
queer
sorts
of
tact
.
Perhaps
they
*NL*
thought
that
Edward
's
too
early
conversion
would
frighten
off
other
*NL*
Protestant
desirables
from
marrying
Catholic
girls
.
Perhaps
they
saw
*NL*
deeper
into
Edward
than
he
saw
himself
and
thought
that
he
would
make
*NL*
a
not
very
creditable
convert
.
At
any
rate
they
--
and
Leonora
--
left
him
*NL*
very
much
alone
.
It
mortified
him
very
considerably
.
He
has
told
me
that
*NL*
if
Leonora
had
then
taken
his
aspirations
seriously
everything
would
*NL*
have
been
different
.
But
I
dare
say
that
was
nonsense
.
At
any
rate
,
it
*NL*
was
over
the
question
of
the
chapel
that
they
had
their
first
and
*NL*
really
disastrous
quarrel
.
Edward
at
that
time
was
not
well
;
he
supposed
*NL*
himself
to
be
overworked
with
his
regimental
affairs
--
he
was
managing
*NL*
the
mess
at
the
time
.
And
Leonora
was
not
well
--
she
was
beginning
to
*NL*
fear
that
their
union
might
be
sterile
.
And
then
her
father
came
over
*NL*
from
Glasmoyle
to
stay
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
were
troublesome
times
in
Ireland
,
I
understand
.
At
any
rate
,
*NL*
Colonel
Powys
had
tenants
on
the
brain
--
his
own
tenants
having
shot
at
*NL*
him
with
shot-guns
.
And
,
in
conversation
with
Edward
's
land-steward
,
*NL*
he
got
it
into
his
head
that
Edward
managed
his
estates
with
a
*NL*
mad
generosity
towards
his
tenants
.
I
understand
,
also
,
that
those
*NL*
years
--
the
`
nineties
--
were
very
bad
for
farming
.
Wheat
was
fetching
only
*NL*
a
few
shillings
the
hundred
;
the
price
of
meat
was
so
low
that
cattle
*NL*
hardly
paid
for
raising
;
whole
English
counties
were
ruined
.
And
Edward
*NL*
allowed
his
tenants
very
high
rebates
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
do
both
justice
Leonora
has
since
acknowledged
that
she
was
in
the
*NL*
wrong
at
that
time
and
that
Edward
was
following
out
a
more
far-seeing
*NL*
policy
in
nursing
his
really
very
good
tenants
over
a
bad
period
.
It
was
*NL*
not
as
if
the
whole
of
his
money
came
from
the
land
;
a
good
deal
of
it
*NL*
was
in
rails
.
But
old
Colonel
Powys
had
that
bee
in
his
bonnet
and
,
if
*NL*
he
never
directly
approached
Edward
himself
on
the
subject
,
he
preached
*NL*
unceasingly
,
whenever
he
had
the
opportunity
,
to
Leonora
.
His
pet
idea
*NL*
was
that
Edward
ought
to
sack
all
his
own
tenants
and
import
a
set
of
*NL*
farmers
from
Scotland
.
That
was
what
they
were
doing
in
Essex
.
He
was
of
*NL*
opinion
that
Edward
was
riding
hotfoot
to
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
worried
Leonora
very
much
--
it
worried
her
dreadfully
;
she
lay
*NL*
awake
nights
;
she
had
an
anxious
line
round
her
mouth
.
And
that
,
again
,
*NL*
worried
Edward
.
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
Leonora
actually
spoke
to
*NL*
Edward
about
his
tenants
--
but
he
got
to
know
that
some
one
,
probably
*NL*
her
father
,
had
been
talking
to
her
about
the
matter
.
He
got
to
know
it
*NL*
because
it
was
the
habit
of
his
steward
to
look
in
on
them
every
morning
*NL*
about
breakfast-time
to
report
any
little
happenings
.
And
there
was
a
*NL*
farmer
called
Mumford
who
had
only
paid
half
his
rent
for
the
last
*NL*
three
years
.
One
morning
the
land-steward
reported
that
Mumford
would
be
*NL*
unable
to
pay
his
rent
at
all
that
year
.
Edward
reflected
for
a
moment
*NL*
and
then
he
said
something
like
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
,
he
's
an
old
fellow
and
his
family
have
been
our
tenants
for
*NL*
over
two
hundred
years
.
Let
him
off
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Leonora
--
you
must
remember
that
she
had
reason
for
being
very
*NL*
nervous
and
unhappy
at
that
time
--
let
out
a
sound
that
was
very
like
a
*NL*
groan
.
It
startled
Edward
,
who
more
than
suspected
what
was
passing
in
*NL*
her
mind
--
it
startled
him
into
a
state
of
anger
.
He
said
sharply
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
have
me
turn
out
people
who
've
been
earning
money
for
us
*NL*
for
centuries
--
people
to
whom
we
have
responsibilities
--
and
let
in
a
*NL*
pack
of
Scotch
farmers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
,
Leonora
said
,
with
what
was
practically
a
glance
of
*NL*
hatred
and
then
,
precipitately
,
he
left
the
breakfast-table
.
Leonora
*NL*
knew
that
it
probably
made
it
all
the
worse
that
he
had
been
betrayed
*NL*
into
a
manifestation
of
anger
before
a
third
party
.
It
was
the
first
and
*NL*
last
time
that
he
ever
was
betrayed
into
such
a
manifestation
of
anger
.
*NL*
The
land-steward
,
a
moderate
and
well-balanced
man
whose
family
also
had
*NL*
been
with
the
Ashburnhams
for
over
a
century
,
took
it
upon
himself
to
*NL*
explain
that
he
considered
Edward
was
pursuing
a
perfectly
proper
course
*NL*
with
his
tenants
.
He
erred
perhaps
a
little
on
the
side
of
generosity
,
*NL*
but
hard
times
were
hard
times
,
and
every
one
had
to
feel
the
pinch
,
*NL*
landlord
as
well
as
tenants
.
The
great
thing
was
not
to
let
the
land
*NL*
get
into
a
poor
state
of
cultivation
.
Scotch
farmers
just
skinned
your
*NL*
fields
and
let
them
go
down
and
down
.
But
Edward
had
a
very
good
set
of
*NL*
tenants
who
did
their
best
for
him
and
for
themselves
.
These
arguments
*NL*
at
that
time
carried
very
little
conviction
to
Leonora
.
She
was
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
much
concerned
by
Edward
's
outburst
of
anger
.
The
fact
is
*NL*
that
Leonora
had
been
practising
economies
in
her
department
.
Two
of
the
*NL*
under-housemaids
had
gone
and
she
had
not
replaced
them
;
she
had
spent
*NL*
much
less
that
year
upon
dress
.
The
fare
she
had
provided
at
the
dinners
*NL*
they
gave
had
been
much
less
bountiful
and
not
nearly
so
costly
as
*NL*
had
been
the
case
in
preceding
years
,
and
Edward
began
to
perceive
a
*NL*
hardness
and
determination
in
his
wife
's
character
.
He
seemed
to
see
a
*NL*
net
closing
round
him
--
a
net
in
which
they
would
be
forced
to
live
like
*NL*
one
of
the
comparatively
poor
county
families
of
the
neighbourhood
.
And
,
*NL*
in
the
mysterious
way
in
which
two
people
,
living
together
,
get
to
know
*NL*
each
other
's
thoughts
without
a
word
spoken
,
he
had
known
,
even
before
*NL*
his
outbreak
,
that
Leonora
was
worrying
about
his
managing
of
the
*NL*
estates
.
This
appeared
to
him
to
be
intolerable
.
He
had
,
too
,
a
great
*NL*
feeling
of
self-contempt
because
he
had
been
betrayed
into
speaking
*NL*
harshly
to
Leonora
before
that
land-steward
.
She
imagined
that
his
nerve
*NL*
must
be
deserting
him
,
and
there
can
have
been
few
men
more
miserable
*NL*
than
Edward
was
at
that
period
.
You
see
,
he
was
really
a
very
simple
*NL*
soul
--
very
simple
.
He
imagined
that
no
man
can
satisfactorily
accomplish
*NL*
his
life
's
work
without
loyal
and
whole-hearted
cooperation
of
the
woman
*NL*
he
lives
with
.
And
he
was
beginning
to
perceive
dimly
that
,
whereas
*NL*
his
own
traditions
were
entirely
collective
,
his
wife
was
a
sheer
*NL*
individualist
.
His
own
theory
--
the
feudal
theory
of
an
over-lord
doing
*NL*
his
best
by
his
dependents
,
the
dependents
meanwhile
doing
their
best
*NL*
for
the
over-lord
--
this
theory
was
entirely
foreign
to
Leonora
's
nature
.
*NL*
She
came
of
a
family
of
small
Irish
landlords
--
that
hostile
garrison
in
*NL*
a
plundered
country
.
And
she
was
thinking
unceasingly
of
the
children
*NL*
she
wished
to
have
.
I
do
n't
know
why
they
never
had
any
children
--
not
*NL*
that
I
really
believe
that
children
would
have
made
any
difference
.
The
*NL*
dissimilarity
of
Edward
and
Leonora
was
too
profound
.
It
will
give
you
*NL*
some
idea
of
the
extraordinary
naivete
of
Edward
Ashburnham
that
,
at
the
*NL*
time
of
his
marriage
and
for
perhaps
a
couple
of
years
after
,
he
did
not
*NL*
really
know
how
children
are
produced
.
Neither
did
Leonora
.
I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
to
say
that
this
state
of
things
continued
,
but
there
it
was
.
I
dare
say
*NL*
it
had
a
good
deal
of
influence
on
their
mentalities
.
At
any
rate
,
they
*NL*
never
had
a
child
.
It
was
the
Will
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
certainly
presented
itself
to
Leonora
as
being
the
Will
of
God
--
as
*NL*
being
a
mysterious
and
awful
chastisement
of
the
Almighty
.
For
she
had
*NL*
discovered
shortly
before
this
period
that
her
parents
had
not
exacted
*NL*
from
Edward
's
family
the
promise
that
any
children
she
should
bear
*NL*
should
be
brought
up
as
Catholics
.
She
herself
had
never
talked
of
the
*NL*
matter
with
either
her
father
,
her
mother
,
or
her
husband
.
When
at
last
*NL*
her
father
had
let
drop
some
words
leading
her
to
believe
that
that
was
*NL*
the
fact
,
she
tried
desperately
to
extort
the
promise
from
Edward
.
She
*NL*
encountered
an
unexpected
obstinacy
.
Edward
was
perfectly
willing
*NL*
that
the
girls
should
be
Catholic
;
the
boys
must
be
Anglican
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
the
bearing
of
these
things
in
English
society
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
Englishmen
seem
to
me
to
be
a
little
mad
in
matters
of
politics
or
of
*NL*
religion
.
In
Edward
it
was
particularly
queer
because
he
himself
was
*NL*
perfectly
ready
to
become
a
Romanist
.
He
seemed
,
however
,
to
contemplate
*NL*
going
over
to
Rome
himself
and
yet
letting
his
boys
be
educated
in
the
*NL*
religion
of
their
immediate
ancestors
.
This
may
appear
illogical
,
but
*NL*
I
dare
say
it
is
not
so
illogical
as
it
looks
.
Edward
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
regarded
himself
as
having
his
own
body
and
soul
at
his
own
disposal
.
*NL*
But
his
loyalty
to
the
traditions
of
his
family
would
not
permit
him
to
*NL*
bind
any
future
inheritors
of
his
name
or
beneficiaries
by
the
death
*NL*
of
his
ancestors
.
About
the
girls
it
did
not
so
much
matter
.
They
would
*NL*
know
other
homes
and
other
circumstances
.
Besides
,
it
was
the
usual
*NL*
thing
.
But
the
boys
must
be
given
the
opportunity
of
choosing
--
and
*NL*
they
must
have
first
of
all
the
Anglican
teaching
.
He
was
perfectly
*NL*
unshakable
about
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
was
in
an
agony
during
all
this
time
.
You
will
have
to
remember
*NL*
she
seriously
believed
that
children
who
might
be
born
to
her
went
in
*NL*
danger
,
if
not
absolutely
of
damnation
,
at
any
rate
of
receiving
false
*NL*
doctrine
.
It
was
an
agony
more
terrible
than
she
could
describe
.
She
*NL*
did
n't
indeed
attempt
to
describe
it
,
but
I
could
tell
from
her
voice
*NL*
when
she
said
,
almost
negligently
,
``
I
used
to
lie
awake
whole
nights
.
It
*NL*
was
no
good
my
spiritual
advisers
trying
to
console
me
.
''
I
knew
from
her
*NL*
voice
how
terrible
and
how
long
those
nights
must
have
seemed
and
of
*NL*
how
little
avail
were
the
consolations
of
her
spiritual
advisers
.
Her
*NL*
spiritual
advisers
seemed
to
have
taken
the
matter
a
little
more
calmly
.
*NL*
They
certainly
told
her
that
she
must
not
consider
herself
in
any
way
*NL*
to
have
sinned
.
Nay
,
they
seem
even
to
have
extorted
,
to
have
threatened
*NL*
her
,
with
a
view
to
getting
her
out
of
what
they
considered
to
be
a
*NL*
morbid
frame
of
mind
.
She
would
just
have
to
make
the
best
of
things
,
*NL*
to
influence
the
children
when
they
came
,
not
by
propaganda
,
but
by
*NL*
personality
.
And
they
warned
her
that
she
would
be
committing
a
sin
if
*NL*
she
continued
to
think
that
she
had
sinned
.
Nevertheless
,
she
continued
*NL*
to
think
that
she
had
sinned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
could
not
be
aware
that
the
man
whom
she
loved
passionately
*NL*
and
whom
,
nevertheless
,
she
was
beginning
to
try
to
rule
with
a
rod
of
*NL*
iron
--
that
this
man
was
becoming
more
and
more
estranged
from
her
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
regard
her
as
being
not
only
physically
and
mentally
cold
,
but
*NL*
even
as
being
actually
wicked
and
mean
.
There
were
times
when
he
would
*NL*
almost
shudder
if
she
spoke
to
him
.
And
she
could
not
understand
how
*NL*
he
could
consider
her
wicked
or
mean
.
It
only
seemed
to
her
a
sort
of
*NL*
madness
in
him
that
he
should
try
to
take
upon
his
own
shoulders
the
*NL*
burden
of
his
troop
,
of
his
regiment
,
of
his
estate
and
of
half
of
his
*NL*
country
.
She
could
not
see
that
in
trying
to
curb
what
she
regarded
as
*NL*
megalomania
she
was
doing
anything
wicked
.
She
was
just
trying
to
keep
*NL*
things
together
for
the
sake
of
the
children
who
did
not
come
.
And
,
*NL*
little
by
little
,
the
whole
of
their
intercourse
became
simply
one
of
*NL*
agonized
discussion
as
to
whether
Edward
should
subscribe
to
this
or
*NL*
that
institution
or
should
try
to
reclaim
this
or
that
drunkard
.
She
*NL*
simply
could
not
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
this
really
terrible
position
of
strain
,
from
which
there
appeared
*NL*
to
be
no
issue
,
the
Kilsyte
case
came
almost
as
a
relief
.
It
is
part
*NL*
of
the
peculiar
irony
of
things
that
Edward
would
certainly
never
have
*NL*
kissed
that
nurse-maid
if
he
had
not
been
trying
to
please
Leonora
.
*NL*
Nurse-maids
do
not
travel
first-class
,
and
,
that
day
,
Edward
travelled
*NL*
in
a
third-class
carriage
in
order
to
prove
to
Leonora
that
he
was
*NL*
capable
of
economies
.
I
have
said
that
the
Kilsyte
case
came
almost
as
a
*NL*
relief
to
the
strained
situation
that
then
existed
between
them
.
It
*NL*
gave
Leonora
an
opportunity
of
backing
him
up
in
a
whole-hearted
and
*NL*
absolutely
loyal
manner
.
It
gave
her
the
opportunity
of
behaving
to
him
*NL*
as
he
considered
a
wife
should
behave
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
Edward
found
himself
in
a
railway
carriage
with
a
quite
pretty
*NL*
girl
of
about
nineteen
.
And
the
quite
pretty
girl
of
about
nineteen
,
*NL*
with
dark
hair
and
red
cheeks
and
blue
eyes
,
was
quietly
weeping
.
Edward
*NL*
had
been
sitting
in
his
corner
thinking
about
nothing
at
all
.
He
had
*NL*
chanced
to
look
at
the
nurse-maid
;
two
large
,
pretty
tears
came
out
of
*NL*
her
eyes
and
dropped
into
her
lap
.
He
immediately
felt
that
he
had
*NL*
got
to
do
something
to
comfort
her
.
That
was
his
job
in
life
.
He
was
*NL*
desperately
unhappy
himself
and
it
seemed
to
him
the
most
natural
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
that
they
should
pool
their
sorrows
.
He
was
quite
*NL*
democratic
;
the
idea
of
the
difference
in
their
station
never
seems
to
*NL*
have
occurred
to
him
.
He
began
to
talk
to
her
.
He
discovered
that
her
*NL*
young
man
had
been
seen
walking
out
with
Annie
of
Number
54
.
He
moved
*NL*
over
to
her
side
of
the
carriage
.
He
told
her
that
the
report
probably
*NL*
was
n't
true
;
that
,
after
all
,
a
young
man
might
take
a
walk
with
Annie
*NL*
from
Number
54
without
its
denoting
anything
very
serious
.
And
he
*NL*
assured
me
that
he
felt
at
least
quite
half-fatherly
when
he
put
his
arm
*NL*
around
her
waist
and
kissed
her
.
The
girl
,
however
,
had
not
forgotten
*NL*
the
difference
of
her
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
her
life
,
by
her
mother
,
by
other
girls
,
by
schoolteachers
,
by
the
*NL*
whole
tradition
of
her
class
she
had
been
warned
against
gentlemen
.
She
*NL*
was
being
kissed
by
a
gentleman
.
She
screamed
,
tore
herself
away
;
sprang
*NL*
up
and
pulled
a
communication
cord
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
came
fairly
well
out
of
the
affair
in
the
public
estimation
;
but
*NL*
it
did
him
,
mentally
,
a
good
deal
of
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
IT
is
very
difficult
to
give
an
all-round
impression
of
a
man
.
I
wonder
*NL*
how
far
I
have
succeeded
with
Edward
Ashburnham
.
I
dare
say
I
have
n't
*NL*
succeeded
at
all
.
It
is
ever
very
difficult
to
see
how
such
things
*NL*
matter
.
Was
it
the
important
point
about
poor
Edward
that
he
was
very
*NL*
well
built
,
carried
himself
well
,
was
moderate
at
the
table
and
led
a
*NL*
regular
life
--
that
he
had
,
in
fact
,
all
the
virtues
that
are
usually
*NL*
accounted
English
?
Or
have
I
in
the
least
succeeded
in
conveying
that
*NL*
he
was
all
those
things
and
had
all
those
virtues
?
He
certainly
was
them
*NL*
and
had
them
up
to
the
last
months
of
his
life
.
They
were
the
things
*NL*
that
one
would
set
upon
his
tombstone
.
They
will
,
indeed
,
be
set
upon
*NL*
his
tombstone
by
his
widow
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
have
I
,
I
wonder
,
given
the
due
impression
of
how
his
life
was
*NL*
portioned
and
his
time
laid
out
?
Because
,
until
the
very
last
,
the
*NL*
amount
of
time
taken
up
by
his
various
passions
was
relatively
small
.
I
*NL*
have
been
forced
to
write
very
much
about
his
passions
,
but
you
have
to
*NL*
consider
--
I
should
like
to
be
able
to
make
you
consider
--
that
he
rose
*NL*
every
morning
at
seven
,
took
a
cold
bath
,
breakfasted
at
eight
,
was
*NL*
occupied
with
his
regiment
from
nine
until
one
;
played
polo
or
cricket
*NL*
with
the
men
when
it
was
the
season
for
cricket
,
till
tea-time
.
*NL*
Afterwards
he
would
occupy
himself
with
the
letters
from
his
*NL*
land-steward
or
with
the
affairs
of
his
mess
,
till
dinner-time
.
He
*NL*
would
dine
and
pass
the
evening
playing
cards
,
or
playing
billiards
with
*NL*
Leonora
or
at
social
functions
of
one
kind
or
another
.
And
the
greater
*NL*
part
of
his
life
was
taken
up
by
that
--
by
far
the
greater
part
of
his
*NL*
life
.
His
love-affairs
,
until
the
very
end
,
were
sandwiched
in
at
*NL*
odd
moments
or
took
place
during
the
social
evenings
,
the
dances
and
*NL*
dinners
.
But
I
guess
I
have
made
it
hard
for
you
,
O
silent
listener
,
to
*NL*
get
that
impression
.
Anyhow
,
I
hope
I
have
not
given
you
the
idea
that
*NL*
Edward
Ashburnham
was
a
pathological
case
.
He
was
n't
.
He
was
just
a
*NL*
normal
man
and
very
much
of
a
sentimentalist
.
I
dare
say
the
quality
*NL*
of
his
youth
,
the
nature
of
his
mother
's
influence
,
his
ignorances
,
the
*NL*
crammings
that
he
received
at
the
hands
of
army
coaches
--
I
dare
say
that
*NL*
all
these
excellent
influences
upon
his
adolescence
were
very
bad
for
*NL*
him
.
But
we
all
have
to
put
up
with
that
sort
of
thing
and
no
doubt
it
*NL*
is
very
bad
for
all
of
us
.
Nevertheless
,
the
outline
of
Edward
's
*NL*
life
was
an
outline
perfectly
normal
of
the
life
of
a
hard-working
,
*NL*
sentimental
and
efficient
professional
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
question
of
first
impressions
has
always
bothered
me
a
good
*NL*
deal
--
but
quite
academically
.
I
mean
that
,
from
time
to
time
I
have
*NL*
wondered
whether
it
were
or
were
not
best
to
trust
to
one
's
first
*NL*
impressions
in
dealing
with
people
.
But
I
never
had
anybody
to
deal
with
*NL*
except
waiters
and
chambermaids
and
the
Ashburnhams
,
with
whom
I
*NL*
did
n't
know
that
I
was
having
any
dealings
.
And
,
as
far
as
waiters
*NL*
and
chambermaids
were
concerned
,
I
have
generally
found
that
my
first
*NL*
impressions
were
correct
enough
.
If
my
first
idea
of
a
man
was
that
he
*NL*
was
civil
,
obliging
,
and
attentive
,
he
generally
seemed
to
go
on
being
*NL*
all
those
things
.
Once
,
however
,
at
our
Paris
flat
we
had
a
maid
*NL*
who
appeared
to
be
charming
and
transparently
honest
.
She
stole
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
one
of
Florence
's
diamond
rings
.
She
did
it
,
however
,
*NL*
to
save
her
young
man
from
going
to
prison
.
So
here
,
as
somebody
says
*NL*
somewhere
,
was
a
special
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
even
in
my
short
incursion
into
American
business
life
--
an
*NL*
incursion
that
lasted
during
part
of
August
and
nearly
the
whole
of
*NL*
September
--
I
found
that
to
rely
upon
first
impressions
was
the
best
*NL*
thing
I
could
do
.
I
found
myself
automatically
docketing
and
labelling
*NL*
each
man
as
he
was
introduced
to
me
,
by
the
run
of
his
features
and
by
*NL*
the
first
words
that
he
spoke
.
I
ca
n't
,
however
,
be
regarded
as
really
*NL*
doing
business
during
the
time
that
I
spent
in
the
United
States
.
I
was
*NL*
just
winding
things
up
.
If
it
had
n't
been
for
my
idea
of
marrying
the
*NL*
girl
I
might
possibly
have
looked
for
something
to
do
in
my
own
country
.
*NL*
For
my
experiences
there
were
vivid
and
amusing
.
It
was
exactly
as
if
I
*NL*
had
come
out
of
a
museum
into
a
riotous
fancy-dress
ball
.
During
my
life
*NL*
with
Florence
I
had
almost
come
to
forget
that
there
were
such
things
as
*NL*
fashions
or
occupations
or
the
greed
of
gain
.
I
had
,
in
fact
,
forgotten
*NL*
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
dollar
and
that
a
dollar
can
be
*NL*
extremely
desirable
if
you
do
n't
happen
to
possess
one
.
And
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
,
too
,
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
gossip
that
mattered
.
*NL*
In
that
particular
,
Philadelphia
was
the
most
amazing
place
I
have
ever
*NL*
been
in
in
my
life
.
I
was
not
in
that
city
for
more
than
a
week
or
ten
*NL*
days
and
I
did
n't
there
transact
anything
much
in
the
way
of
business
;
*NL*
nevertheless
,
the
number
of
times
that
I
was
warned
by
everybody
against
*NL*
everybody
else
was
simply
amazing
.
A
man
I
did
n't
know
would
come
up
*NL*
behind
my
lounge
chair
in
the
hotel
,
and
,
whispering
cautiously
beside
*NL*
my
ear
,
would
warn
me
against
some
other
man
that
I
equally
did
n't
know
*NL*
but
who
would
be
standing
by
the
bar
.
I
do
n't
know
what
they
thought
I
*NL*
was
there
to
do
--
perhaps
to
buy
out
the
city
's
debt
or
get
a
controlling
*NL*
hold
of
some
railway
interest
.
Or
,
perhaps
,
they
imagined
that
I
wanted
*NL*
to
buy
a
newspaper
,
for
they
were
either
politicians
or
reporters
,
*NL*
which
,
of
course
,
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
my
*NL*
property
in
Philadelphia
was
mostly
real
estate
in
the
old-fashioned
*NL*
part
of
the
city
and
all
I
wanted
to
do
there
was
just
to
satisfy
myself
*NL*
that
the
houses
were
in
good
repair
and
the
doors
kept
properly
painted
.
*NL*
I
wanted
also
to
see
my
relations
,
of
whom
I
had
a
few
.
These
were
*NL*
mostly
professional
people
and
they
were
mostly
rather
hard
up
because
*NL*
of
the
big
bank
failure
in
1907
or
thereabouts
.
Still
,
they
were
very
*NL*
nice
.
They
would
have
been
nicer
still
if
they
had
n't
,
all
of
them
,
had
*NL*
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
mania
that
what
they
called
influences
*NL*
were
working
against
them
.
At
any
rate
,
the
impression
of
that
city
was
*NL*
one
of
old-fashioned
rooms
,
rather
English
than
American
in
type
,
*NL*
in
which
handsome
but
careworn
ladies
,
cousins
of
my
own
,
talked
*NL*
principally
about
mysterious
movements
that
were
going
on
against
them
.
*NL*
I
never
got
to
know
what
it
was
all
about
;
perhaps
they
thought
I
knew
*NL*
or
perhaps
there
were
n't
any
movements
at
all
.
It
was
all
very
secret
*NL*
and
subtle
and
subterranean
.
But
there
was
a
nice
young
fellow
called
*NL*
Carter
who
was
a
sort
of
second-nephew
of
mine
,
twice
removed
.
He
was
*NL*
handsome
and
dark
and
gentle
and
tall
and
modest
.
I
understand
also
that
*NL*
he
was
a
good
cricketer
.
He
was
employed
by
the
real-estate
agents
*NL*
who
collected
my
rents
.
It
was
he
,
therefore
,
who
took
me
over
my
own
*NL*
property
and
I
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
and
of
a
nice
girl
called
Mary
,
to
*NL*
whom
he
was
engaged
.
At
that
time
I
did
,
what
I
certainly
should
n't
do
*NL*
now
--
I
made
some
careful
inquiries
as
to
his
character
.
I
discovered
*NL*
from
his
employers
that
he
was
just
all
that
he
appeared
,
honest
,
*NL*
industrious
,
high-spirited
,
friendly
and
ready
to
do
anyone
a
good
turn
.
*NL*
His
relatives
,
however
,
as
they
were
mine
,
too
--
seemed
to
have
something
*NL*
darkly
mysterious
against
him
.
I
imagined
that
he
must
have
been
mixed
*NL*
up
in
some
case
of
graft
or
that
he
had
at
least
betrayed
several
*NL*
innocent
and
trusting
maidens
.
I
pushed
,
however
,
that
particular
*NL*
mystery
home
and
discovered
it
was
only
that
he
was
a
Democrat
.
My
own
*NL*
people
were
mostly
Republicans
.
It
seemed
to
make
it
worse
and
more
*NL*
darkly
mysterious
to
them
that
young
Carter
was
what
they
called
a
sort
*NL*
of
a
Vermont
Democrat
which
was
the
whole
ticket
and
no
mistake
.
But
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
it
means
.
Anyhow
,
I
suppose
that
my
money
will
go
to
*NL*
him
when
I
die
--
I
like
the
recollection
of
his
friendly
image
and
of
the
*NL*
nice
girl
he
was
engaged
to
.
May
Fate
deal
very
kindly
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
said
just
now
that
,
in
my
present
frame
of
mind
,
nothing
would
*NL*
ever
make
me
make
inquiries
as
to
the
character
of
any
man
that
I
liked
*NL*
at
first
sight
.
-LRB-
The
little
digression
as
to
my
Philadelphia
experiences
*NL*
was
really
meant
to
lead
around
to
this
.
-RRB-
For
who
in
this
world
can
*NL*
give
anyone
a
character
?
Who
in
this
world
knows
anything
of
any
other
*NL*
heart
--
or
of
his
own
?
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
one
can
not
form
an
*NL*
average
estimate
of
the
way
a
person
will
behave
.
But
one
can
not
be
*NL*
certain
of
the
way
any
man
will
behave
in
every
case
--
and
until
one
can
*NL*
do
that
a
``
character
''
is
of
no
use
to
anyone
.
That
,
for
instance
,
was
*NL*
the
way
with
Florence
's
maid
in
Paris
.
We
used
to
trust
that
girl
with
*NL*
blank
cheques
for
the
payment
of
the
tradesmen
.
For
quite
a
time
she
was
*NL*
so
trusted
by
us
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
she
stole
a
ring
.
We
should
not
have
*NL*
believed
her
capable
of
it
;
she
would
not
have
believed
herself
capable
*NL*
of
it
.
It
was
nothing
in
her
character
.
So
,
perhaps
,
it
was
with
Edward
*NL*
Ashburnham
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
,
perhaps
,
it
was
n't
.
No
,
I
rather
think
it
was
n't
.
It
is
difficult
*NL*
to
figure
out
.
I
have
said
that
the
Kilsyte
case
eased
the
immediate
*NL*
tension
for
him
and
Leonora
.
It
let
him
see
that
she
was
capable
of
*NL*
loyalty
to
him
;
it
gave
her
her
chance
to
show
that
she
believed
in
him
.
*NL*
She
accepted
without
question
his
statement
that
,
in
kissing
the
girl
,
*NL*
he
was
n't
trying
to
do
more
than
administer
fatherly
comfort
to
*NL*
a
weeping
child
.
And
,
indeed
,
his
own
world
--
including
the
*NL*
magistrates
--
took
that
view
of
the
case
.
Whatever
people
say
,
one
's
*NL*
world
can
be
perfectly
charitable
at
times
...
But
,
again
,
as
I
have
*NL*
said
,
it
did
Edward
a
great
deal
of
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
,
at
least
,
was
his
view
of
it
.
He
assured
me
that
,
before
that
*NL*
case
came
on
and
was
wrangled
about
by
counsel
with
all
sorts
of
*NL*
dirty-mindedness
that
counsel
in
that
sort
of
case
can
impute
,
he
*NL*
had
not
had
the
least
idea
that
he
was
capable
of
being
unfaithful
to
*NL*
Leonora
.
But
,
in
the
midst
of
that
tumult
--
he
says
that
it
came
suddenly
*NL*
into
his
head
whilst
he
was
in
the
witness-box
--
in
the
midst
of
those
*NL*
august
ceremonies
of
the
law
there
came
suddenly
into
his
mind
the
*NL*
recollection
of
the
softness
of
the
girl
's
body
as
he
had
pressed
her
*NL*
to
him
.
And
,
from
that
moment
,
that
girl
appeared
desirable
to
him
--
and
*NL*
Leonora
completely
unattractive
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
indulge
in
day-dreams
in
which
he
approached
the
nurse-maid
*NL*
more
tactfully
and
carried
the
matter
much
further
.
Occasionally
he
*NL*
thought
of
other
women
in
terms
of
wary
courtship
--
or
,
perhaps
,
it
*NL*
would
be
more
exact
to
say
that
he
thought
of
them
in
terms
of
tactful
*NL*
comforting
,
ending
in
absorption
.
That
was
his
own
view
of
the
case
.
He
*NL*
saw
himself
as
the
victim
of
the
law
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
he
saw
*NL*
himself
as
a
kind
of
Dreyfus
.
The
law
,
practically
,
was
quite
kind
to
*NL*
him
.
It
stated
that
in
its
view
Captain
Ashburnham
had
been
misled
by
an
*NL*
ill-placed
desire
to
comfort
a
member
of
the
opposite
sex
,
and
it
fined
*NL*
him
five
shilling
for
his
want
of
tact
,
or
of
knowledge
of
the
world
.
*NL*
But
Edward
maintained
that
it
had
put
ideas
into
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
though
he
certainly
did
.
He
was
twenty-seven
then
,
*NL*
and
his
wife
was
out
of
sympathy
with
him
--
some
crash
was
inevitable
.
*NL*
There
was
between
them
a
momentary
rapprochement
;
but
it
could
not
last
.
*NL*
It
made
it
,
probably
,
all
the
worse
that
,
in
that
particular
matter
,
*NL*
Leonara
had
come
so
very
well
up
to
the
scratch
.
For
,
whilst
Edward
*NL*
respected
her
more
and
was
grateful
to
her
,
it
made
her
seem
by
so
*NL*
much
the
more
cold
in
other
matters
that
were
near
his
heart
--
his
*NL*
responsibilities
,
his
career
,
his
tradition
.
It
brought
his
despair
of
*NL*
her
up
to
a
point
of
exasperation
--
and
it
riveted
on
him
the
idea
that
*NL*
he
might
find
some
other
woman
who
would
give
him
the
moral
support
that
*NL*
he
needed
.
He
wanted
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
sort
of
Lohengrin
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
,
he
says
,
he
went
about
deliberately
looking
for
some
woman
*NL*
who
could
help
him
.
He
found
several
--
for
there
were
quite
a
number
of
*NL*
ladies
in
his
set
who
were
capable
of
agreeing
with
this
handsome
and
*NL*
fine
fellow
that
the
duties
of
a
feudal
gentleman
were
feudal
.
He
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
pass
his
days
talking
to
one
or
other
of
these
ladies
.
But
*NL*
there
was
always
an
obstacle
--
if
the
lady
were
married
there
would
be
a
*NL*
husband
who
claimed
the
greater
part
of
her
time
and
attention
.
If
,
on
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
it
were
an
unmarried
girl
,
he
could
not
see
very
much
of
*NL*
her
for
fear
of
compromising
her
.
At
that
date
,
you
understand
,
he
had
*NL*
not
the
least
idea
of
seducing
any
one
of
these
ladies
.
He
wanted
*NL*
only
moral
support
at
the
hands
of
some
female
,
because
he
found
men
*NL*
difficult
to
talk
to
about
ideals
.
Indeed
,
I
do
not
believe
that
he
had
,
*NL*
at
any
time
,
any
idea
of
making
any
one
his
mistress
.
That
sounds
queer
;
*NL*
but
I
believe
it
is
quite
true
as
a
statement
of
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
I
believe
,
one
of
Leonora
's
priests
--
a
man
of
the
world
--
who
*NL*
suggested
that
she
should
take
him
to
Monte
Carlo
.
He
had
the
idea
that
*NL*
what
Edward
needed
,
in
order
to
fit
him
for
the
society
of
Leonora
,
*NL*
was
a
touch
of
irresponsibility
.
For
Edward
,
at
that
date
,
had
much
the
*NL*
aspect
of
a
prig
.
I
mean
that
,
if
he
played
polo
and
was
an
excellent
*NL*
dancer
he
did
the
one
for
the
sake
of
keeping
himself
fit
and
the
other
*NL*
because
it
was
a
social
duty
to
show
himself
at
dances
,
and
,
when
there
,
*NL*
to
dance
well
.
He
did
nothing
for
fun
except
what
he
considered
to
be
*NL*
his
work
in
life
.
As
the
priest
saw
it
,
this
must
for
ever
estrange
him
*NL*
from
Leonora
--
not
because
Leonora
set
much
store
by
the
joy
of
life
,
but
*NL*
because
she
was
out
of
sympathy
with
Edward
's
work
.
On
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
Leonora
did
like
to
have
a
good
time
,
now
and
then
,
and
,
as
the
priest
*NL*
saw
it
,
if
Edward
could
be
got
to
like
having
a
good
time
now
and
then
,
*NL*
too
,
there
would
be
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
them
.
It
was
a
good
idea
,
*NL*
but
it
worked
out
wrongly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
worked
out
,
in
fact
,
in
the
mistress
of
the
Grand
Duke
.
In
anyone
*NL*
less
sentimental
than
Edward
that
would
not
have
mattered
.
With
Edward
*NL*
it
was
fatal
.
For
,
such
was
his
honourable
nature
,
that
for
him
to
enjoy
*NL*
a
woman
's
favours
made
him
feel
that
she
had
a
bond
on
him
for
life
.
*NL*
That
was
the
way
it
worked
out
in
practice
.
Psychologically
it
meant
*NL*
that
he
could
not
have
a
mistress
without
falling
violently
in
love
with
*NL*
her
.
He
was
a
serious
person
--
and
in
this
particular
case
it
was
*NL*
very
expensive
.
The
mistress
of
the
Grand
Duke
--
a
Spanish
dancer
of
*NL*
passionate
appearance
--
singled
out
Edward
for
her
glances
at
a
ball
that
*NL*
was
held
in
their
common
hotel
.
Edward
was
tall
,
handsome
,
blond
and
*NL*
very
wealthy
as
she
understood
--
and
Leonora
went
up
to
bed
early
.
She
*NL*
did
not
care
for
public
dances
,
but
she
was
relieved
to
see
that
Edward
*NL*
appeared
to
be
having
a
good
time
with
several
amiable
girls
.
And
that
*NL*
was
the
end
of
Edward
--
for
the
Spanish
dancer
of
passionate
appearance
*NL*
wanted
one
night
of
him
for
his
beaux
yeux
.
He
took
her
into
the
dark
*NL*
gardens
and
,
remembering
suddenly
the
girl
of
the
Kilsyte
case
,
he
*NL*
kissed
her
.
He
kissed
her
passionately
,
violently
,
with
a
sudden
*NL*
explosion
of
the
passion
that
had
been
bridled
all
his
life
--
for
*NL*
Leonora
was
cold
,
or
at
any
rate
,
well
behaved
.
La
Dolciquita
liked
this
*NL*
reversion
,
and
he
passed
the
night
in
her
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
palpitating
creature
was
at
last
asleep
in
his
arms
he
*NL*
discovered
that
he
was
madly
,
was
passionately
,
was
overwhelmingly
in
*NL*
love
with
her
.
It
was
a
passion
that
had
arisen
like
fire
in
dry
corn
.
*NL*
He
could
think
of
nothing
else
;
he
could
live
for
nothing
else
.
But
La
*NL*
Dolciquita
was
a
reasonable
creature
without
an
ounce
of
passion
in
*NL*
her
.
She
wanted
a
certain
satisfaction
of
her
appetites
and
Edward
had
*NL*
appealed
to
her
the
night
before
.
Now
that
was
done
with
,
and
,
quite
*NL*
coldly
,
she
said
that
she
wanted
money
if
he
was
to
have
any
more
of
*NL*
her
.
It
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
commercial
transaction
.
She
did
not
*NL*
care
two
buttons
for
Edward
or
for
any
man
and
he
was
asking
her
to
*NL*
risk
a
very
good
situation
with
the
Grand
Duke
.
If
Edward
could
put
up
*NL*
sufficient
money
to
serve
as
a
kind
of
insurance
against
accident
she
*NL*
was
ready
to
like
Edward
for
a
time
that
would
be
covered
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
by
the
policy
.
She
was
getting
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
year
from
her
*NL*
Grand
Duke
;
Edward
would
have
to
pay
a
premium
of
two
years
'
hire
for
a
*NL*
month
of
her
society
.
There
would
not
be
much
risk
of
the
Grand
Duke
's
*NL*
finding
it
out
and
it
was
not
certain
that
he
would
give
her
the
keys
of
*NL*
the
street
if
he
did
find
out
.
But
there
was
the
risk
--
a
twenty
per
cent
*NL*
risk
,
as
she
figured
it
out
.
She
talked
to
Edward
as
if
she
had
been
a
*NL*
solicitor
with
an
estate
to
sell
--
perfectly
quietly
and
perfectly
coldly
*NL*
without
any
inflections
in
her
voice
.
She
did
not
want
to
be
unkind
*NL*
to
him
;
but
she
could
see
no
reason
for
being
kind
to
him
.
She
was
a
*NL*
virtuous
business
woman
with
a
mother
and
two
sisters
and
her
own
old
*NL*
age
to
be
provided
comfortably
for
.
She
did
not
expect
more
than
a
five
*NL*
years
'
further
run
.
She
was
twenty-four
and
,
as
she
said
:
``
We
Spanish
*NL*
women
are
horrors
at
thirty
.
''
Edward
swore
that
he
would
provide
for
her
*NL*
for
life
if
she
would
come
to
him
and
leave
off
talking
so
horribly
;
but
*NL*
she
only
shrugged
one
shoulder
slowly
and
contemptuously
.
He
tried
*NL*
to
convince
this
woman
,
who
,
as
he
saw
it
,
had
surrendered
to
him
her
*NL*
virtue
,
that
he
regarded
it
as
in
any
case
his
duty
to
provide
for
her
,
*NL*
and
to
cherish
her
and
even
to
love
her
--
for
life
.
In
return
for
her
*NL*
sacrifice
he
would
do
that
.
In
return
,
again
,
for
his
honourable
love
*NL*
she
would
listen
for
ever
to
the
accounts
of
his
estate
.
That
was
how
he
*NL*
figured
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shrugged
the
same
shoulder
with
the
same
gesture
and
held
out
her
*NL*
left
hand
with
the
elbow
at
her
side
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enfin
,
mon
ami
,
''
she
said
,
``
put
in
this
hand
the
price
of
that
tiara
at
*NL*
Forli
's
or
...
''
And
she
turned
her
back
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
went
mad
;
his
world
stood
on
its
head
;
the
palms
in
front
of
the
*NL*
blue
sea
danced
grotesque
dances
.
You
see
,
he
believed
in
the
virtue
,
*NL*
tenderness
and
moral
support
of
women
.
He
wanted
more
than
anything
to
*NL*
argue
with
La
Dolciquita
;
to
retire
with
her
to
an
island
and
point
out
*NL*
to
her
the
damnation
of
her
point
of
view
and
how
salvation
can
only
*NL*
be
found
in
true
love
and
the
feudal
system
.
She
had
once
been
his
*NL*
mistress
,
he
reflected
,
and
by
all
the
moral
laws
she
ought
to
have
gone
*NL*
on
being
his
mistress
or
at
the
very
least
his
sympathetic
confidante
.
*NL*
But
her
rooms
were
closed
to
him
;
she
did
not
appear
in
the
hotel
.
*NL*
Nothing
:
blank
silence
.
To
break
that
down
he
had
to
have
twenty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
.
You
have
heard
what
happened
.
He
spent
a
week
of
*NL*
madness
;
he
hungered
;
his
eyes
sank
in
;
he
shuddered
at
Leonora
's
touch
.
*NL*
I
dare
say
that
nine-tenths
of
what
he
took
to
be
his
passion
for
*NL*
La
Dolciquita
was
really
discomfort
at
the
thought
that
he
had
been
*NL*
unfaithful
to
Leonora
.
He
felt
uncommonly
bad
,
that
is
to
say
--
oh
,
*NL*
unbearably
bad
,
and
he
took
it
all
to
be
love
.
Poor
devil
,
he
was
*NL*
incredibly
naive
.
He
drank
like
a
fish
after
Leonora
was
in
bed
and
he
*NL*
spread
himself
over
the
tables
,
and
this
went
on
for
about
a
fortnight
.
*NL*
Heaven
knows
what
would
have
happened
;
he
would
have
thrown
away
every
*NL*
penny
that
he
possessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
night
after
he
had
lost
about
forty
thousand
pounds
and
whilst
*NL*
the
whole
hotel
was
whispering
about
it
,
La
Dolciquita
walked
composedly
*NL*
into
his
bedroom
.
He
was
too
drunk
to
recognize
her
,
and
she
sat
in
his
*NL*
arm-chair
,
knitting
and
holding
smelling
salts
to
her
nose
--
for
he
was
*NL*
pretty
far
gone
with
alcoholic
poisoning
--
and
,
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
*NL*
understand
her
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
mon
ami
,
do
not
go
to
the
tables
again
.
Take
a
good
sleep
*NL*
now
and
come
and
see
me
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slept
till
the
lunch-hour
.
By
that
time
Leonora
had
heard
the
news
.
*NL*
A
Mrs
Colonel
Whelan
had
told
her
.
Mrs
Colonel
Whelan
seems
to
have
been
*NL*
the
only
sensible
person
who
was
ever
connected
with
the
Ashburnhams
.
*NL*
She
had
argued
it
out
that
there
must
be
a
woman
of
the
harpy
variety
*NL*
connected
with
Edward
's
incredible
behaviour
and
mien
;
and
she
advised
*NL*
Leonora
to
go
straight
off
to
Town
--
which
might
have
the
effect
of
*NL*
bringing
Edward
to
his
senses
--
and
to
consult
her
solicitor
and
her
*NL*
spiritual
adviser
.
She
had
better
go
that
very
morning
;
it
was
no
good
*NL*
arguing
with
a
man
in
Edward
's
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
,
indeed
,
did
not
know
that
she
had
gone
.
As
soon
as
he
awoke
he
*NL*
went
straight
to
La
Dolciquita
's
room
and
she
stood
him
his
lunch
in
her
*NL*
own
apartments
.
He
fell
on
her
neck
and
wept
,
and
she
put
up
with
it
for
*NL*
a
time
.
She
was
quite
a
good-natured
woman
.
And
,
when
she
had
calmed
*NL*
him
down
with
Eau
de
Melisse
,
she
said
:
``
Look
here
,
my
friend
,
how
much
*NL*
money
have
you
left
?
Five
thousand
dollars
?
Ten
?
''
For
the
rumour
went
*NL*
that
Edward
had
lost
two
kings
'
ransoms
a
night
for
fourteen
nights
and
*NL*
she
imagined
that
he
must
be
near
the
end
of
his
resources
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Eau
de
Melisse
had
calmed
Edward
to
such
an
extent
that
,
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
he
really
had
a
head
on
his
shoulders
.
He
did
nothing
more
than
*NL*
grunt
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
she
answered
,
``
I
may
just
as
well
have
the
ten
thousand
dollars
*NL*
as
the
tables
.
I
will
go
with
you
to
Antibes
for
a
week
for
that
sum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
grunted
:
``
Five
.
''
She
tried
to
get
seven
thousand
five
hundred
;
*NL*
but
he
stuck
to
his
five
thousand
and
the
hotel
expenses
at
Antibes
.
The
*NL*
sedative
carried
him
just
as
far
as
that
and
then
he
collapsed
again
.
He
*NL*
had
to
leave
for
Antibes
at
three
;
he
could
not
do
without
it
.
He
left
a
*NL*
note
for
Leonora
saying
that
he
had
gone
off
for
a
week
with
the
Clinton
*NL*
Morleys
,
yachting
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
enjoy
himself
very
much
at
Antibes
.
La
Dolciquita
could
*NL*
talk
of
nothing
with
any
enthusiasm
except
money
,
and
she
tired
*NL*
him
unceasingly
,
during
every
waking
hour
,
for
presents
of
the
most
*NL*
expensive
description
.
And
,
at
the
end
of
a
week
,
she
just
quietly
*NL*
kicked
him
out
.
He
hung
about
in
Antibes
for
three
days
.
He
was
cured
*NL*
of
the
idea
that
he
had
any
duties
towards
La
Dolciquita
--
feudal
or
*NL*
otherwise
.
But
his
sentimentalism
required
of
him
an
attitude
of
Byronic
*NL*
gloom
--
as
if
his
court
had
gone
into
half-mourning
.
Then
his
appetite
*NL*
suddenly
returned
,
and
he
remembered
Leonora
.
He
found
at
his
hotel
at
*NL*
Monte
Carlo
a
telegram
from
Leonora
,
dispatched
from
London
,
saying
;
*NL*
``
Please
return
as
soon
as
convenient
.
''
He
could
not
understand
why
*NL*
Leonora
should
have
abandoned
him
so
precipitately
when
she
only
thought
*NL*
that
he
had
gone
yachting
with
the
Clinton
Morleys
.
Then
he
discovered
*NL*
that
she
had
left
the
hotel
before
he
had
written
the
note
.
He
had
*NL*
a
pretty
rocky
journey
back
to
town
;
he
was
frightened
out
of
his
*NL*
life
--
and
Leonora
had
never
seemed
so
desirable
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
I
CALL
this
the
Saddest
Story
,
rather
than
``
The
Ashburnham
Tragedy
''
,
*NL*
just
because
it
is
so
sad
,
just
because
there
was
no
current
to
draw
*NL*
things
along
to
a
swift
and
inevitable
end
.
There
is
about
it
none
of
*NL*
the
elevation
that
accompanies
tragedy
;
there
is
about
it
no
nemesis
,
no
*NL*
destiny
.
Here
were
two
noble
people
--
for
I
am
convinced
that
both
Edward
*NL*
and
Leonora
had
noble
natures
--
here
,
then
,
were
two
noble
natures
,
*NL*
drifting
down
life
,
like
fireships
afloat
on
a
lagoon
and
causing
*NL*
miseries
,
heart-aches
,
agony
of
the
mind
and
death
.
And
they
themselves
*NL*
steadily
deteriorated
.
And
why
?
For
what
purpose
?
To
point
what
lesson
?
*NL*
It
is
all
a
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
not
even
any
villain
in
the
story
--
for
even
Major
Basil
,
the
*NL*
husband
of
the
lady
who
next
,
and
really
,
comforted
the
unfortunate
*NL*
Edward
--
even
Major
Basil
was
not
a
villain
in
this
piece
.
He
was
a
*NL*
slack
,
loose
,
shiftless
sort
of
fellow
--
but
he
did
not
do
anything
to
*NL*
Edward
.
Whilst
they
were
in
the
same
station
in
Burma
he
borrowed
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
money
--
though
,
really
,
since
Major
Basil
had
no
*NL*
particular
vices
,
it
was
difficult
to
know
why
he
wanted
it
.
He
*NL*
collected
--
different
types
of
horses
'
bits
from
the
earliest
times
to
*NL*
the
present
day
--
but
,
since
he
did
not
prosecute
even
this
occupation
*NL*
with
any
vigour
,
he
can
not
have
needed
much
money
for
the
acquirement
,
*NL*
say
,
of
the
bit
of
Genghis
Khan
's
charger
--
if
Genghis
Khan
had
a
*NL*
charger
.
And
when
I
say
that
he
borrowed
a
good
deal
of
money
from
*NL*
Edward
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
had
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
from
*NL*
him
during
the
five
years
that
the
connection
lasted
.
Edward
,
of
course
,
*NL*
did
not
have
a
great
deal
of
money
;
Leonora
was
seeing
to
that
.
Still
,
*NL*
he
may
have
had
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
English
,
for
his
menus
*NL*
plaisirs
--
for
his
regimental
subscriptions
and
for
keeping
his
men
*NL*
smart
.
Leonora
hated
that
;
she
would
have
preferred
to
buy
dresses
for
*NL*
herself
or
to
have
devoted
the
money
to
paying
off
a
mortgage
.
Still
,
*NL*
with
her
sense
of
justice
,
she
saw
that
,
since
she
was
managing
*NL*
a
property
bringing
in
three
thousand
a
year
with
a
view
to
*NL*
re-establishing
it
as
a
property
of
five
thousand
a
year
and
since
the
*NL*
property
really
,
if
not
legally
,
belonged
to
Edward
,
it
was
reasonable
*NL*
and
just
that
Edward
should
get
a
slice
of
his
own
.
Of
course
she
had
*NL*
the
devil
of
a
job
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
got
the
financial
details
exactly
right
.
I
am
*NL*
a
pretty
good
head
at
figures
,
but
my
mind
,
still
,
sometimes
mixes
up
*NL*
pounds
with
dollars
and
I
get
a
figure
wrong
.
Anyhow
,
the
proposition
*NL*
was
something
like
this
:
Properly
worked
and
without
rebates
to
the
*NL*
tenants
and
keeping
up
schools
and
things
,
the
Branshaw
estate
should
*NL*
have
brought
in
about
five
thousand
a
year
when
Edward
had
it
.
It
*NL*
brought
in
actually
about
four
.
-LRB-
I
am
talking
in
pounds
,
not
dollars
.
-RRB-
*NL*
Edward
's
excesses
with
the
Spanish
Lady
had
reduced
its
value
to
about
*NL*
three
--
as
the
maximum
figure
,
without
reductions
.
Leonora
wanted
to
get
*NL*
it
back
to
five
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
,
of
course
,
very
young
to
be
faced
with
such
a
*NL*
proposition
--
twenty-four
is
not
a
very
advanced
age
.
So
she
did
things
*NL*
with
a
youthful
vigour
that
she
would
,
very
likely
,
have
made
more
*NL*
merciful
,
if
she
had
known
more
about
life
.
She
got
Edward
remarkably
on
*NL*
the
hop
.
He
had
to
face
her
in
a
London
hotel
,
when
he
crept
back
from
*NL*
Monte
Carlo
with
his
poor
tail
between
his
poor
legs
.
As
far
as
I
can
*NL*
make
out
she
cut
short
his
first
mumblings
and
his
first
attempts
at
*NL*
affectionate
speech
with
words
something
like
:
``
We
're
on
the
verge
*NL*
of
ruin
.
Do
you
intend
to
let
me
pull
things
together
?
If
not
I
shall
*NL*
retire
to
Hendon
on
my
jointure
.
''
-LRB-
Hendon
represented
a
convent
to
*NL*
which
she
occasionally
went
for
what
is
called
a
``
retreat
''
in
Catholic
*NL*
circles
.
-RRB-
And
poor
dear
Edward
knew
nothing
--
absolutely
nothing
.
He
did
*NL*
not
know
how
much
money
he
had
,
as
he
put
it
,
``
blued
''
at
the
tables
.
It
*NL*
might
have
been
a
quarter
of
a
million
for
all
he
remembered
.
He
did
not
*NL*
know
whether
she
knew
about
La
Dolciquita
or
whether
she
imagined
that
*NL*
he
had
gone
off
yachting
or
had
stayed
at
Monte
Carlo
.
He
was
just
dumb
*NL*
and
he
just
wanted
to
get
into
a
hole
and
not
have
to
talk
.
Leonora
did
*NL*
not
make
him
talk
and
she
said
nothing
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
much
about
English
legal
procedure
--
I
can
not
,
I
mean
,
give
*NL*
technical
details
of
how
they
tied
him
up
.
But
I
know
that
,
two
days
*NL*
later
,
without
her
having
said
more
than
I
have
reported
to
you
,
Leonora
*NL*
and
her
attorney
had
become
the
trustees
,
as
I
believe
it
is
called
,
*NL*
of
all
Edward
's
property
,
and
there
was
an
end
of
Edward
as
the
good
*NL*
landlord
and
father
of
his
people
.
He
went
out
.
Leonora
then
had
three
*NL*
thousand
a
year
at
her
disposal
.
She
occupied
Edward
with
getting
*NL*
himself
transferred
to
a
part
of
his
regiment
that
was
in
Burma
--
if
that
*NL*
is
the
right
way
to
put
it
.
She
herself
had
an
interview
,
lasting
a
*NL*
week
or
so
--
with
Edward
's
land-steward
.
She
made
him
understand
that
the
*NL*
estate
would
have
to
yield
up
to
its
last
penny
.
Before
they
left
for
*NL*
India
she
had
let
Branshaw
for
seven
years
at
a
thousand
a
year
.
She
*NL*
sold
two
Vandykes
and
a
little
silver
for
eleven
thousand
pounds
and
*NL*
she
raised
,
on
mortgage
,
twenty-nine
thousand
.
That
went
to
Edward
's
*NL*
money-lending
friends
in
Monte
Carlo
.
So
she
had
to
get
the
twenty-nine
*NL*
thousand
back
,
for
she
did
not
regard
the
Vandykes
and
the
silver
*NL*
as
things
she
would
have
to
replace
.
They
were
just
frills
to
the
*NL*
Ashburnham
vanity
.
Edward
cried
for
two
days
over
the
disappearance
of
*NL*
his
ancestors
and
then
she
wished
she
had
not
done
it
;
but
it
did
not
*NL*
teach
her
anything
and
it
lessened
such
esteem
as
she
had
for
him
.
She
*NL*
did
not
also
understand
that
to
let
Branshaw
affected
him
with
a
feeling
*NL*
of
physical
soiling
--
that
it
was
almost
as
bad
for
him
as
if
a
woman
*NL*
belonging
to
him
had
become
a
prostitute
.
That
was
how
it
did
affect
*NL*
him
;
but
I
dare
say
she
felt
just
as
bad
about
the
Spanish
dancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
went
at
it
.
They
were
eight
years
in
India
,
and
during
the
whole
*NL*
of
that
time
she
insisted
that
they
must
be
self-supporting
--
they
had
*NL*
to
live
on
his
Captain
's
pay
,
plus
the
extra
allowance
for
being
at
the
*NL*
front
.
She
gave
him
the
five
hundred
a
year
for
Ashburnham
frills
,
as
*NL*
she
called
it
to
herself
--
and
she
considered
she
was
doing
him
very
*NL*
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
in
a
way
,
she
did
him
very
well
--
but
it
was
not
his
way
.
She
was
*NL*
always
buying
him
expensive
things
which
,
as
it
were
,
she
took
off
her
*NL*
own
back
.
I
have
,
for
instance
,
spoken
of
Edward
's
leather
cases
.
Well
,
*NL*
they
were
not
Edward
's
at
all
;
they
were
Leonora
's
manifestations
.
He
*NL*
liked
to
be
clean
,
but
he
preferred
,
as
it
were
,
to
be
threadbare
.
She
*NL*
never
understood
that
,
and
all
that
pigskin
was
her
idea
of
a
reward
to
*NL*
him
for
putting
her
up
to
a
little
speculation
by
which
she
made
eleven
*NL*
hundred
pounds
.
She
did
,
herself
,
the
threadbare
business
.
When
they
*NL*
went
up
to
a
place
called
Simla
,
where
,
as
I
understand
,
it
is
cool
in
*NL*
the
summer
and
very
social
--
when
they
went
up
to
Simla
for
their
healths
*NL*
it
was
she
who
had
him
prancing
around
,
as
we
should
say
in
the
United
*NL*
States
,
on
a
thousand-dollar
horse
with
the
gladdest
of
glad
rags
all
*NL*
over
him
.
She
herself
used
to
go
into
``
retreat
''
.
I
believe
that
was
very
*NL*
good
for
her
health
and
it
was
also
very
inexpensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
probably
also
very
good
for
Edward
's
health
,
because
he
pranced
*NL*
about
mostly
with
Mrs
Basil
,
who
was
a
nice
woman
and
very
,
very
kind
to
*NL*
him
.
I
suppose
she
was
his
mistress
,
but
I
never
heard
it
from
Edward
,
*NL*
of
course
.
I
seem
to
gather
that
they
carried
it
on
in
a
high
romantic
*NL*
fashion
,
very
proper
to
both
of
them
--
or
,
at
any
rate
,
for
Edward
;
she
*NL*
seems
to
have
been
a
tender
and
gentle
soul
who
did
what
he
wanted
.
I
do
*NL*
not
mean
to
say
that
she
was
without
character
;
that
was
her
job
,
to
*NL*
do
what
Edward
wanted
.
So
I
figured
it
out
,
that
for
those
five
years
,
*NL*
Edward
wanted
long
passages
of
deep
affection
kept
up
in
long
,
long
*NL*
talks
and
that
every
now
and
then
they
``
fell
,
''
which
would
give
Edward
*NL*
an
opportunity
for
remorse
and
an
excuse
to
lend
the
Major
another
*NL*
fifty
.
I
do
n't
think
that
Mrs
Basil
considered
it
to
be
``
falling
''
;
she
*NL*
just
pitied
him
and
loved
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
Leonora
and
Edward
had
to
talk
about
something
during
all
these
*NL*
years
.
You
can
not
be
absolutely
dumb
when
you
live
with
a
person
unless
*NL*
you
are
an
inhabitant
of
the
North
of
England
or
the
State
of
Maine
.
So
*NL*
Leonora
imagined
the
cheerful
device
of
letting
him
see
the
accounts
of
*NL*
his
estate
and
discussing
them
with
him
.
He
did
not
discuss
them
much
;
*NL*
he
was
trying
to
behave
prettily
.
But
it
was
old
Mr
Mumford
--
the
farmer
*NL*
who
did
not
pay
his
rent
--
that
threw
Edward
into
Mrs
Basil
's
arms
.
Mrs
*NL*
Basil
came
upon
Edward
in
the
dusk
,
in
the
Burmese
garden
,
with
all
*NL*
sorts
of
flowers
and
things
.
And
he
was
cutting
up
that
crop
--
with
his
*NL*
sword
,
not
a
walking-stick
.
He
was
also
carrying
on
and
cursing
in
a
way
*NL*
you
would
not
believe
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ascertained
that
an
old
gentleman
called
Mumford
had
been
ejected
*NL*
from
his
farm
and
had
been
given
a
little
cottage
rent-free
,
where
*NL*
he
lived
on
ten
shillings
a
week
from
a
farmers
'
benevolent
society
,
*NL*
supplemented
by
seven
that
was
being
allowed
him
by
the
Ashburnham
*NL*
trustees
.
Edward
had
just
discovered
that
fact
from
the
estate
accounts
.
*NL*
Leonora
had
left
them
in
his
dressing-room
and
he
had
begun
to
read
*NL*
them
before
taking
off
his
marching-kit
.
That
was
how
he
came
to
have
a
*NL*
sword
.
Leonora
considered
that
she
had
been
unusually
generous
to
old
Mr
*NL*
Mumford
in
allowing
him
to
inhabit
a
cottage
,
rent-free
,
and
in
giving
*NL*
him
seven
shillings
a
week
.
Anyhow
,
Mrs
Basil
had
never
seen
a
man
in
*NL*
such
a
state
as
Edward
was
.
She
had
been
passionately
in
love
with
*NL*
him
for
quite
a
time
,
and
he
had
been
longing
for
her
sympathy
and
*NL*
admiration
with
a
passion
as
deep
.
That
was
how
they
came
to
speak
about
*NL*
it
,
in
the
Burmese
garden
,
under
the
pale
sky
,
with
sheaves
of
severed
*NL*
vegetation
,
misty
and
odorous
,
in
the
night
around
their
feet
.
I
think
*NL*
they
behaved
themselves
with
decorum
for
quite
a
time
after
that
,
though
*NL*
Mrs
Basil
spent
so
many
hours
over
the
accounts
of
the
Ashburnham
estate
*NL*
that
she
got
the
name
of
every
field
by
heart
.
Edward
had
a
huge
map
of
*NL*
his
lands
in
his
harness-room
and
Major
Basil
did
not
seem
to
mind
.
I
*NL*
believe
that
people
do
not
mind
much
in
lonely
stations
.
It
might
*NL*
have
lasted
for
ever
if
the
Major
had
not
been
made
what
is
called
a
*NL*
brevet-colonel
during
the
shuffling
of
troops
that
went
on
just
before
*NL*
the
South
African
War
.
He
was
sent
off
somewhere
else
and
,
of
course
,
*NL*
Mrs
Basil
could
not
stay
with
Edward
.
Edward
ought
,
I
suppose
,
to
have
*NL*
gone
to
the
Transvaal
.
It
would
have
done
him
a
great
deal
of
good
to
*NL*
get
killed
.
But
Leonora
would
not
let
him
;
she
had
heard
awful
stories
*NL*
of
the
extravagance
of
the
hussar
regiment
in
war-time
--
how
they
left
*NL*
hundred-bottle
cases
of
champagne
,
at
five
guineas
a
bottle
,
on
the
*NL*
veldt
and
so
on
.
Besides
,
she
preferred
to
see
how
Edward
was
spending
*NL*
his
five
hundred
a
year
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
Edward
had
any
*NL*
grievance
in
that
.
He
was
never
a
man
of
the
deeds
of
heroism
sort
and
*NL*
it
was
just
as
good
for
him
to
be
sniped
at
up
in
the
hills
of
the
North
*NL*
Western
frontier
,
as
to
be
shot
at
by
an
old
gentleman
in
a
tophat
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
some
spruit
.
Those
are
more
or
less
his
words
about
it
.
I
*NL*
believe
he
quite
distinguished
himself
over
there
.
At
any
rate
,
he
had
*NL*
had
his
D.S.O.
and
was
made
a
brevet-major
.
Leonora
,
however
,
was
not
in
*NL*
the
least
keen
on
his
soldiering
.
She
hated
also
his
deeds
of
heroism
.
*NL*
One
of
their
bitterest
quarrels
came
after
he
had
,
for
the
second
*NL*
time
,
in
the
Red
Sea
,
jumped
overboard
from
the
troopship
and
rescued
a
*NL*
private
soldier
.
She
stood
it
the
first
time
and
even
complimented
him
.
*NL*
But
the
Red
Sea
was
awful
,
that
trip
,
and
the
private
soldiers
seemed
*NL*
to
develop
a
suicidal
craze
.
It
got
on
Leonora
's
nerves
;
she
figured
*NL*
Edward
,
for
the
rest
of
that
trip
,
jumping
overboard
every
ten
minutes
.
*NL*
And
the
mere
cry
of
``
Man
overboard
''
is
a
disagreeable
,
alarming
and
*NL*
disturbing
thing
.
The
ship
gets
stopped
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
*NL*
shouts
.
And
Edward
would
not
promise
not
to
do
it
again
,
though
,
*NL*
fortunately
,
they
struck
a
streak
of
cooler
weather
when
they
were
*NL*
in
the
Persian
Gulf
.
Leonora
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
Edward
was
*NL*
trying
to
commit
suicide
,
so
I
guess
it
was
pretty
awful
for
her
when
*NL*
he
would
not
give
the
promise
.
Leonora
ought
never
to
have
been
on
that
*NL*
troopship
;
but
she
got
there
somehow
,
as
an
economy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Major
Basil
discovered
his
wife
's
relation
with
Edward
just
before
*NL*
he
was
sent
to
his
other
station
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
that
was
a
*NL*
blackmailer
's
adroitness
or
just
a
trick
of
destiny
.
He
may
have
known
*NL*
of
it
all
the
time
or
he
may
not
.
At
any
rate
,
he
got
hold
of
,
just
*NL*
about
then
,
some
letters
and
things
.
It
cost
Edward
three
hundred
pounds
*NL*
immediately
.
I
do
not
know
how
it
was
arranged
;
I
can
not
imagine
how
*NL*
even
a
blackmailer
can
make
his
demands
.
I
suppose
there
is
some
sort
of
*NL*
way
of
saving
your
face
.
I
figure
the
Major
as
disclosing
the
letters
*NL*
to
Edward
with
furious
oaths
,
then
accepting
his
explanations
that
the
*NL*
letters
were
perfectly
innocent
if
the
wrong
construction
were
not
put
*NL*
upon
them
.
Then
the
Major
would
say
:
``
I
say
,
old
chap
,
I
'm
deuced
hard
*NL*
up
.
Could
n't
you
lend
me
three
hundred
or
so
?
''
I
fancy
that
was
how
it
*NL*
was
.
And
,
year
by
year
,
after
that
there
would
come
a
letter
from
the
*NL*
Major
,
saying
that
he
was
deuced
hard
up
and
could
n't
Edward
lend
him
*NL*
three
hundred
or
so
?
Edward
was
pretty
hard
hit
when
Mrs
Basil
had
to
go
*NL*
away
.
He
really
had
been
very
fond
of
her
,
and
he
remained
faithful
to
*NL*
her
memory
for
quite
a
long
time
.
And
Mrs
Basil
had
loved
him
very
much
*NL*
and
continued
to
cherish
a
hope
of
reunion
with
him
.
Three
days
ago
*NL*
there
came
a
quite
proper
but
very
lamentable
letter
from
her
to
*NL*
Leonora
,
asking
to
be
given
particulars
as
to
Edward
's
death
.
She
had
*NL*
read
the
advertisement
of
it
in
an
Indian
paper
.
I
think
she
must
have
*NL*
been
a
very
nice
woman
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
Ashburnhams
were
moved
somewhere
up
towards
a
place
or
a
*NL*
district
called
Chitral
.
I
am
no
good
at
geography
of
the
Indian
Empire
.
*NL*
By
that
time
they
had
settled
down
into
a
model
couple
and
they
never
*NL*
spoke
in
private
to
each
other
.
Leonora
had
given
up
even
showing
the
*NL*
accounts
of
the
Ashburnham
estate
to
Edward
.
He
thought
that
that
was
*NL*
because
she
had
piled
up
such
a
lot
of
money
that
she
did
not
want
him
*NL*
to
know
how
she
was
getting
on
any
more
.
But
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
after
*NL*
five
or
six
years
it
had
penetrated
to
her
mind
that
it
was
painful
to
*NL*
Edward
to
have
to
look
on
at
the
accounts
of
his
estate
and
have
no
hand
*NL*
in
the
management
of
it
.
She
was
trying
to
do
him
a
kindness
.
And
,
up
in
*NL*
Chitral
,
poor
dear
little
Maisie
Maidan
came
along
...
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
most
unsettling
to
Edward
of
all
his
affairs
.
It
made
him
*NL*
suspect
that
he
was
inconstant
.
The
affair
with
the
Dolciquita
he
had
*NL*
sized
up
as
a
short
attack
of
madness
like
hydrophobia
.
His
relations
*NL*
with
Mrs
Basil
had
not
seemed
to
him
to
imply
moral
turpitude
of
a
*NL*
gross
kind
.
The
husband
had
been
complaisant
;
they
had
really
loved
each
*NL*
other
;
his
wife
was
very
cruel
to
him
and
had
long
ceased
to
be
a
wife
*NL*
to
him
.
He
thought
that
Mrs
Basil
had
been
his
soul-mate
,
separated
from
*NL*
him
by
an
unkind
fate
--
something
sentimental
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
discovered
that
,
whilst
he
was
still
writing
long
weekly
letters
*NL*
to
Mrs
Basil
,
he
was
beginning
to
be
furiously
impatient
if
he
missed
*NL*
seeing
Maisie
Maidan
during
the
course
of
the
day
.
He
discovered
himself
*NL*
watching
the
doorways
with
impatience
;
he
discovered
that
he
disliked
*NL*
her
boy
husband
very
much
for
hours
at
a
time
.
He
discovered
that
he
*NL*
was
getting
up
at
unearthly
hours
in
order
to
have
time
,
later
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
to
go
for
a
walk
with
Maisie
Maidan
.
He
discovered
himself
*NL*
using
little
slang
words
that
she
used
and
attaching
a
sentimental
value
*NL*
to
those
words
.
These
,
you
understand
,
were
discoveries
that
came
so
*NL*
late
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
drift
.
He
was
losing
weight
;
his
eyes
*NL*
were
beginning
to
fall
in
;
he
had
touches
of
bad
fever
.
He
was
,
as
he
*NL*
described
it
,
pipped
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
one
ghastly
hot
day
,
he
suddenly
heard
himself
say
to
Leonora
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
could
n't
we
take
Mrs
Maidan
with
us
to
Europe
and
drop
her
at
*NL*
Nauheim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
n't
had
the
least
idea
of
saying
that
to
Leonora
.
He
had
merely
*NL*
been
standing
,
looking
at
an
illustrated
paper
,
waiting
for
dinner
.
*NL*
Dinner
was
twenty
minutes
late
or
the
Ashburnhams
would
not
have
been
*NL*
alone
together
.
No
,
he
had
n't
had
the
least
idea
of
framing
that
speech
.
*NL*
He
had
just
been
standing
in
a
silent
agony
of
fear
,
of
longing
,
of
*NL*
heat
,
of
fever
.
He
was
thinking
that
they
were
going
back
to
Branshaw
in
*NL*
a
month
and
that
Maisie
Maidan
was
going
to
remain
behind
and
die
.
And
*NL*
then
,
that
had
come
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
punkah
swished
in
the
darkened
room
;
Leonora
lay
exhausted
and
*NL*
motionless
in
her
cane
lounge
;
neither
of
them
stirred
.
They
were
both
*NL*
at
that
time
very
ill
in
indefinite
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
Leonora
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
promised
it
to
Charlie
Maidan
this
afternoon
.
I
have
offered
to
*NL*
pay
her
ex
's
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
just
saved
himself
from
saying
:
``
Good
God
!
''
You
see
,
he
had
not
*NL*
the
least
idea
of
what
Leonora
knew
--
about
Maisie
,
about
Mrs
Basil
,
even
*NL*
about
La
Dolciquita
.
It
was
a
pretty
enigmatic
situation
for
him
.
It
*NL*
struck
him
that
Leonora
must
be
intending
to
manage
his
loves
as
she
*NL*
managed
his
money
affairs
and
it
made
her
more
hateful
to
him
--
and
more
*NL*
worthy
of
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
,
at
any
rate
,
had
managed
his
money
to
some
purpose
.
She
had
*NL*
spoken
to
him
,
a
week
before
,
for
the
first
time
in
several
years
--
about
*NL*
money
.
She
had
made
twenty-two
thousand
pounds
out
of
the
Branshaw
*NL*
land
and
seven
by
the
letting
of
Branshaw
furnished
.
By
fortunate
*NL*
investments
--
in
which
Edward
had
helped
her
--
she
had
made
another
six
or
*NL*
seven
thousand
that
might
well
become
more
.
The
mortgages
were
all
*NL*
paid
off
,
so
that
,
except
for
the
departure
of
the
two
Vandykes
and
the
*NL*
silver
,
they
were
as
well
off
as
they
had
been
before
the
Dolciquita
*NL*
had
acted
the
locust
.
It
was
Leonora
's
great
achievement
.
She
laid
the
*NL*
figures
before
Edward
,
who
maintained
an
unbroken
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
propose
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
you
should
resign
from
the
Army
and
that
*NL*
we
should
go
back
to
Branshaw
.
We
are
both
too
ill
to
stay
here
any
*NL*
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
said
nothing
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
Leonora
continued
passionlessly
,
``
is
the
great
day
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
managed
the
job
amazingly
.
You
are
a
wonderful
woman
.
''
He
*NL*
was
thinking
that
if
they
went
back
to
Branshaw
they
would
leave
*NL*
Maisie
Maidan
behind
.
That
thought
occupied
him
exclusively
.
They
must
,
*NL*
undoubtedly
,
return
to
Branshaw
;
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
Leonora
*NL*
was
too
ill
to
stay
in
that
place
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
that
the
management
of
the
whole
of
the
expenditure
of
*NL*
the
income
will
be
in
your
hands
.
There
will
be
five
thousand
a
year
.
''
*NL*
She
thought
that
he
cared
very
much
about
the
expenditure
of
an
income
*NL*
of
five
thousand
a
year
and
that
the
fact
that
she
had
done
so
much
*NL*
for
him
would
rouse
in
him
some
affection
for
her
.
But
he
was
thinking
*NL*
exclusively
of
Maisie
Maidan
--
of
Maisie
,
thousands
of
miles
away
from
*NL*
him
.
He
was
seeing
the
mountains
between
them
--
blue
mountains
and
the
*NL*
sea
and
sunlit
plains
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
generous
of
you
.
''
And
she
did
not
know
whether
that
were
*NL*
praise
or
a
sneer
.
That
had
been
a
week
before
.
And
all
that
week
he
had
*NL*
passed
in
an
increasing
agony
at
the
thought
that
those
mountains
,
that
*NL*
sea
,
and
those
sunlit
plains
would
be
between
him
and
Maisie
Maidan
.
*NL*
That
thought
shook
him
in
the
burning
nights
:
the
sweat
poured
from
him
*NL*
and
he
trembled
with
cold
,
in
the
burning
noons
--
at
that
thought
.
He
*NL*
had
no
minute
's
rest
;
his
bowels
turned
round
and
round
within
him
:
his
*NL*
tongue
was
perpetually
dry
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
breath
between
*NL*
his
teeth
was
like
air
from
a
pest-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
no
thought
to
Leonora
at
all
;
he
had
sent
in
his
papers
.
They
*NL*
were
to
leave
in
a
month
.
It
seemed
to
him
to
be
his
duty
to
leave
that
*NL*
place
and
to
go
away
,
to
support
Leonora
.
He
did
his
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
horrible
,
in
their
relationship
at
that
time
,
that
whatever
she
*NL*
did
caused
him
to
hate
her
.
He
hated
her
when
he
found
that
she
proposed
*NL*
to
set
him
up
as
the
Lord
of
Branshaw
again
--
as
a
sort
of
dummy
lord
,
*NL*
in
swaddling
clothes
.
He
imagined
that
she
had
done
this
in
order
to
*NL*
separate
him
from
Maisie
Maidan
.
Hatred
hung
in
all
the
heavy
nights
and
*NL*
filled
the
shadowy
corners
of
the
room
.
So
when
he
heard
that
she
*NL*
had
offered
to
the
Maidan
boy
to
take
his
wife
to
Europe
with
him
,
*NL*
automatically
he
hated
her
since
he
hated
all
that
she
did
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
him
,
at
that
time
,
that
she
could
never
be
other
than
cruel
even
if
,
by
*NL*
accident
,
an
act
of
hers
were
kind
...
Yes
,
it
was
a
horrible
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
cool
breezes
of
the
ocean
seemed
to
clear
up
that
hatred
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
a
curtain
.
They
seemed
to
give
him
back
admiration
for
her
,
*NL*
and
respect
.
The
agreeableness
of
having
money
lavishly
at
command
,
*NL*
the
fact
that
it
had
bought
for
him
the
companionship
of
Maisie
*NL*
Maidan
--
these
things
began
to
make
him
see
that
his
wife
might
have
been
*NL*
right
in
the
starving
and
scraping
upon
which
she
had
insisted
.
He
was
*NL*
at
ease
;
he
was
even
radiantly
happy
when
he
carried
cups
of
bouillon
*NL*
for
Maisie
Maidan
along
the
deck
.
One
night
,
when
he
was
leaning
beside
*NL*
Leonora
,
over
the
ship
's
side
,
he
said
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
jove
,
you
're
the
finest
woman
in
the
world
.
I
wish
we
could
be
*NL*
better
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
just
turned
away
without
a
word
and
went
to
her
cabin
.
Still
,
she
*NL*
was
very
much
better
in
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
I
suppose
,
I
must
give
you
Leonora
's
side
of
the
case
...
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
very
difficult
.
For
Leonora
,
if
she
preserved
an
unchanged
*NL*
front
,
changed
very
frequently
her
point
of
view
.
She
had
been
*NL*
drilled
--
in
her
tradition
,
in
her
upbringing
--
to
keep
her
mouth
shut
.
*NL*
But
there
were
times
,
she
said
,
when
she
was
so
near
yielding
to
the
*NL*
temptation
of
speaking
that
afterwards
she
shuddered
to
think
of
those
*NL*
times
.
You
must
postulate
that
what
she
desired
above
all
things
was
*NL*
to
keep
a
shut
mouth
to
the
world
;
to
Edward
and
to
the
women
that
he
*NL*
loved
.
If
she
spoke
she
would
despise
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
of
his
unfaithfulness
with
La
Dolciquita
she
never
acted
*NL*
the
part
of
wife
to
Edward
.
It
was
not
that
she
intended
to
keep
herself
*NL*
from
him
as
a
principle
,
for
ever
.
Her
spiritual
advisers
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
forbade
that
.
But
she
stipulated
that
he
must
,
in
some
way
,
perhaps
*NL*
symbolical
,
come
back
to
her
.
She
was
not
very
clear
as
to
what
she
*NL*
meant
;
probably
she
did
not
know
herself
.
Or
perhaps
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
moments
when
he
seemed
to
be
coming
back
to
her
;
there
were
*NL*
moments
when
she
was
within
a
hair
of
yielding
to
her
physical
passion
*NL*
for
him
.
In
just
the
same
way
,
at
moments
,
she
almost
yielded
to
the
*NL*
temptation
to
denounce
Mrs
Basil
to
her
husband
or
Maisie
Maidan
*NL*
to
hers
.
She
desired
then
to
cause
the
horrors
and
pains
of
public
*NL*
scandals
.
For
,
watching
Edward
more
intently
and
with
more
straining
of
*NL*
ears
than
that
which
a
cat
bestows
upon
a
bird
overhead
,
she
was
aware
*NL*
of
the
progress
of
his
passion
for
each
of
these
ladies
.
She
was
aware
*NL*
of
it
from
the
way
in
which
his
eyes
returned
to
doors
and
gateways
;
she
*NL*
knew
from
his
tranquillities
when
he
had
received
satisfactions
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
she
imagined
herself
to
see
more
than
was
warranted
.
She
*NL*
imagined
that
Edward
was
carrying
on
intrigues
with
other
women
--
with
*NL*
two
at
once
;
with
three
.
For
whole
periods
she
imagined
him
to
be
a
*NL*
monster
of
libertinage
and
she
could
not
see
that
he
could
have
anything
*NL*
against
her
.
She
left
him
his
liberty
;
she
was
starving
herself
to
build
*NL*
up
his
fortunes
;
she
allowed
herself
none
of
the
joys
of
femininity
--
no
*NL*
dresses
,
no
jewels
--
hardly
even
friendships
,
for
fear
they
should
cost
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
oddly
,
she
could
not
but
be
aware
that
both
Mrs
Basil
and
*NL*
Maisie
Maidan
were
nice
women
.
The
curious
,
discounting
eye
which
one
*NL*
woman
can
turn
on
another
did
not
prevent
her
seeing
that
Mrs
Basil
was
*NL*
very
good
to
Edward
and
Mrs
Maidan
very
good
for
him
.
That
seemed
her
to
*NL*
be
a
monstrous
and
incomprehensible
working
of
Fate
's
.
Incomprehensible
!
*NL*
Why
,
she
asked
herself
again
and
again
,
did
none
of
the
good
deeds
that
*NL*
she
did
for
her
husband
ever
come
through
to
him
,
or
appear
to
him
as
*NL*
good
deeds
?
By
what
trick
of
mania
could
not
he
let
her
be
as
good
to
*NL*
him
as
Mrs
Basil
was
?
Mrs
Basil
was
not
so
extraordinarily
dissimilar
to
*NL*
herself
.
She
was
,
it
was
true
,
tall
,
dark
,
with
soft
mournful
voice
and
*NL*
a
great
kindness
of
manner
for
every
created
thing
,
from
punkah
men
to
*NL*
flowers
on
the
trees
.
But
she
was
not
so
well
read
as
Lenora
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
in
learned
books
.
Leonora
could
not
stand
novels
.
But
,
even
with
*NL*
all
her
differences
,
Mrs
Basil
did
not
appear
to
Leonora
to
differ
so
*NL*
very
much
from
herself
.
She
was
truthful
,
honest
and
,
for
the
rest
,
just
*NL*
a
woman
.
And
Leonora
had
a
vague
sort
of
idea
that
,
to
a
man
,
all
women
*NL*
are
the
same
after
three
weeks
of
close
intercourse
.
She
thought
that
*NL*
the
kindness
should
no
longer
appeal
,
the
soft
and
mournful
voice
no
*NL*
longer
thrill
,
the
tall
darkness
no
longer
give
a
man
the
illusion
*NL*
that
he
was
going
into
the
depths
of
an
unexplored
wood
.
She
could
not
*NL*
understand
how
Edward
could
go
on
and
on
maundering
over
Mrs
Basil
.
She
*NL*
could
not
see
why
he
should
continue
to
write
her
long
letters
after
*NL*
their
separation
.
After
that
,
indeed
,
she
had
a
very
bad
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
at
that
period
what
I
will
call
the
``
monstrous
''
theory
of
*NL*
Edward
.
She
was
always
imagining
him
ogling
at
every
woman
that
he
came
*NL*
across
.
She
did
not
,
that
year
,
go
into
``
retreat
''
at
Simla
because
she
*NL*
was
afraid
that
he
would
corrupt
her
maid
in
her
absence
.
She
imagined
*NL*
him
carrying
on
intrigues
with
native
women
or
Eurasians
.
At
dances
she
*NL*
was
in
a
fever
of
watchfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
persuaded
herself
that
this
was
because
she
had
a
dread
of
scandals
.
*NL*
Edward
might
get
himself
mixed
up
with
a
marriageable
daughter
of
some
*NL*
man
who
would
make
a
row
or
some
husband
who
would
matter
.
But
,
really
,
*NL*
she
acknowledged
afterwards
to
herself
,
she
was
hoping
that
,
Mrs
Basil
*NL*
being
out
of
the
way
,
the
time
might
have
come
when
Edward
should
return
*NL*
to
her
.
All
that
period
she
passed
in
an
agony
of
jealousy
and
fear
--
the
*NL*
fear
that
Edward
might
really
become
promiscuous
in
his
habits
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
,
in
an
odd
way
,
she
was
glad
when
Maisie
Maidan
came
along
--
and
*NL*
she
realized
that
she
had
not
,
before
,
been
afraid
of
husbands
and
*NL*
of
scandals
,
since
,
then
,
she
did
her
best
to
keep
Maisie
's
husband
*NL*
unsuspicious
.
She
wished
to
appear
so
trustful
of
Edward
that
Maidan
*NL*
could
not
possibly
have
any
suspicions
.
It
was
an
evil
position
for
*NL*
her
.
But
Edward
was
very
ill
and
she
wanted
to
see
him
smile
again
.
She
*NL*
thought
that
if
he
could
smile
again
through
her
agency
he
might
return
,
*NL*
through
gratitude
and
satisfied
love
--
to
her
.
At
that
time
she
thought
*NL*
that
Edward
was
a
person
of
light
and
fleeting
passions
.
And
she
could
*NL*
understand
Edward
's
passion
for
Maisie
,
since
Maisie
was
one
of
those
*NL*
women
to
whom
other
women
will
allow
magnetism
.
She
was
very
pretty
;
she
*NL*
was
very
young
;
in
spite
of
her
heart
she
was
very
gay
and
light
on
her
*NL*
feet
.
And
Leonora
was
really
very
fond
of
Maisie
,
who
was
fond
enough
of
*NL*
Leonora
.
Leonora
,
indeed
,
imagined
that
she
could
manage
this
affair
*NL*
all
right
.
She
had
no
thought
of
Maisie
's
being
led
into
adultery
;
she
*NL*
imagined
that
if
she
could
take
Maisie
and
Edward
to
Nauheim
,
Edward
*NL*
would
see
enough
of
her
to
get
tired
of
her
pretty
little
chatterings
,
*NL*
and
of
the
pretty
little
motions
of
her
hands
and
feet
.
And
she
thought
*NL*
she
could
trust
Edward
.
For
there
was
not
any
doubt
of
Maisie
's
passion
*NL*
for
Edward
.
She
raved
about
him
to
Leonora
as
Leonora
had
heard
girls
*NL*
rave
about
drawing
masters
in
schools
.
She
was
perpetually
asking
her
*NL*
boy
husband
why
he
could
not
dress
,
ride
,
shoot
,
play
polo
,
or
even
*NL*
recite
sentimental
poems
,
like
their
major
.
And
young
Maidan
had
the
*NL*
greatest
admiration
for
Edward
,
and
he
adored
,
was
bewildered
by
and
*NL*
entirely
trusted
his
wife
.
It
appeared
to
him
that
Edward
was
devoted
*NL*
to
Leonora
.
And
Leonora
imagined
that
when
poor
Maisie
was
cured
of
her
*NL*
heart
and
Edward
had
seen
enough
of
her
,
he
would
return
to
her
.
She
had
*NL*
the
vague
,
passionate
idea
that
,
when
Edward
had
exhausted
a
number
of
*NL*
other
types
of
women
he
must
turn
to
her
.
Why
should
not
her
type
have
*NL*
its
turn
in
his
heart
?
She
imagined
that
,
by
now
,
she
understood
him
*NL*
better
,
that
she
understood
better
his
vanities
and
that
,
by
making
him
*NL*
happier
,
she
could
arouse
his
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Florence
knocked
all
that
on
the
head
...

PART
IV
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
I
HAVE
,
I
am
aware
,
told
this
story
in
a
very
rambling
way
so
that
it
*NL*
may
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
find
their
path
through
what
may
be
a
*NL*
sort
of
maze
.
I
can
not
help
it
.
I
have
stuck
to
my
idea
of
being
in
a
*NL*
country
cottage
with
a
silent
listener
,
hearing
between
the
gusts
of
the
*NL*
wind
and
amidst
the
noises
of
the
distant
sea
,
the
story
as
it
comes
.
*NL*
And
,
when
one
discusses
an
affair
--
a
long
,
sad
affair
--
one
goes
back
,
*NL*
one
goes
forward
.
One
remembers
points
that
one
has
forgotten
and
one
*NL*
explains
them
all
the
more
minutely
since
one
recognizes
that
one
has
*NL*
forgotten
to
mention
them
in
their
proper
places
and
that
one
may
have
*NL*
given
,
by
omitting
them
,
a
false
impression
.
I
console
myself
with
*NL*
thinking
that
this
is
a
real
story
and
that
,
after
all
,
real
stories
are
*NL*
probably
told
best
in
the
way
a
person
telling
a
story
would
tell
them
.
*NL*
They
will
then
seem
most
real
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
rate
,
I
think
I
have
brought
my
story
up
to
the
date
of
Maisie
*NL*
Maidan
's
death
.
I
mean
that
I
have
explained
everything
that
went
before
*NL*
it
from
the
several
points
of
view
that
were
necessary
--
from
Leonora
's
,
*NL*
from
Edward
's
and
,
to
some
extent
,
from
my
own
.
You
have
the
facts
for
*NL*
the
trouble
of
finding
them
;
you
have
the
points
of
view
as
far
as
I
*NL*
could
ascertain
or
put
them
.
Let
me
imagine
myself
back
,
then
,
at
*NL*
the
day
of
Maisie
's
death
--
or
rather
at
the
moment
of
Florence
's
*NL*
dissertation
on
the
Protest
,
up
in
the
old
Castle
of
the
town
of
*NL*
M
--
.
Let
us
consider
Leonora
's
point
of
view
with
regard
to
Florence
;
*NL*
Edward
's
,
of
course
,
I
can
not
give
you
,
for
Edward
naturally
never
spoke
*NL*
of
his
affair
with
my
wife
.
-LRB-
I
may
,
in
what
follows
,
be
a
little
hard
*NL*
on
Florence
;
but
you
must
remember
that
I
have
been
writing
away
at
this
*NL*
story
now
for
six
months
and
reflecting
longer
and
longer
upon
these
*NL*
affairs
.
-RRB-
And
the
longer
I
think
about
them
the
more
certain
I
*NL*
become
that
Florence
was
a
contaminating
influence
--
she
depressed
and
*NL*
deteriorated
poor
Edward
;
she
deteriorated
,
hopelessly
,
the
miserable
*NL*
Leonora
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
she
caused
Leonora
's
character
to
*NL*
deteriorate
.
If
there
was
a
fine
point
about
Leonora
it
was
that
she
*NL*
was
proud
and
that
she
was
silent
.
But
that
pride
and
that
silence
broke
*NL*
when
she
made
that
extraordinary
outburst
,
in
the
shadowy
room
that
*NL*
contained
the
Protest
,
and
in
the
little
terrace
looking
over
the
river
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
she
was
doing
a
wrong
thing
.
She
was
certainly
*NL*
doing
right
in
trying
to
warn
me
that
Florence
was
making
eyes
at
her
*NL*
husband
.
But
,
if
she
did
the
right
thing
,
she
was
doing
it
in
the
wrong
*NL*
way
.
Perhaps
she
should
have
reflected
longer
;
she
should
have
spoken
,
*NL*
if
she
wanted
to
speak
,
only
after
reflection
.
Or
it
would
have
been
*NL*
better
if
she
had
acted
--
if
,
for
instance
,
she
had
so
chaperoned
*NL*
Florence
that
private
communication
between
her
and
Edward
became
*NL*
impossible
.
She
should
have
gone
eavesdropping
;
she
should
have
watched
*NL*
outside
bedroom
doors
.
It
is
odious
;
but
that
is
the
way
the
job
is
*NL*
done
.
She
should
have
taken
Edward
away
the
moment
Maisie
was
dead
.
*NL*
No
,
she
acted
wrongly
...
And
yet
,
poor
thing
,
is
it
for
me
to
condemn
*NL*
her
--
and
what
did
it
matter
in
the
end
?
If
it
had
not
been
Florence
,
it
*NL*
would
have
been
some
other
...
Still
,
it
might
have
been
a
better
woman
*NL*
than
my
wife
.
For
Florence
was
vulgar
;
Florence
was
a
common
flirt
who
*NL*
would
not
,
at
the
last
,
lacher
prise
;
and
Florence
was
an
unstoppable
*NL*
talker
.
You
could
not
stop
her
;
nothing
would
stop
her
.
Edward
and
*NL*
Leonora
were
at
least
proud
and
reserved
people
.
Pride
and
reserve
are
*NL*
not
the
only
things
in
life
;
perhaps
they
are
not
even
the
best
things
.
*NL*
But
if
they
happen
to
be
your
particular
virtues
you
will
go
all
to
*NL*
pieces
if
you
let
them
go
.
And
Leonora
let
them
go
.
She
let
them
go
*NL*
before
poor
Edward
did
even
.
Consider
her
position
when
she
burst
out
*NL*
over
the
Luther-Protest
...
Consider
her
agonies
...
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
to
remember
that
the
main
passion
of
her
life
was
to
get
Edward
*NL*
back
;
she
had
never
,
till
that
moment
,
despaired
of
getting
him
back
.
*NL*
That
may
seem
ignoble
;
but
you
have
also
to
remember
that
her
getting
*NL*
him
back
represented
to
her
not
only
a
victory
for
herself
.
It
would
,
as
*NL*
it
appeared
to
her
,
have
been
a
victory
for
all
wives
and
a
victory
for
*NL*
her
Church
.
That
was
how
it
presented
itself
to
her
.
These
things
are
a
*NL*
little
inscrutable
.
I
do
n't
know
why
the
getting
back
of
Edward
should
*NL*
have
represented
to
her
a
victory
for
all
wives
,
for
Society
and
for
*NL*
her
Church
.
Or
,
maybe
,
I
have
a
glimmering
of
it
.
She
saw
life
as
a
*NL*
perpetual
sex-battle
between
husbands
who
desire
to
be
unfaithful
to
*NL*
their
wives
,
and
wives
who
desire
to
recapture
their
husbands
in
the
*NL*
end
.
That
was
her
sad
and
modest
view
of
matrimony
.
Man
,
for
her
,
was
a
*NL*
sort
of
brute
who
must
have
his
divagations
,
his
moments
of
excess
,
his
*NL*
nights
out
,
his
,
let
us
say
,
rutting
seasons
.
She
had
read
few
novels
,
*NL*
so
that
the
idea
of
a
pure
and
constant
love
succeeding
the
sound
of
*NL*
wedding
bells
had
never
been
very
much
presented
to
her
.
She
went
,
*NL*
numbed
and
terrified
,
to
the
Mother
Superior
of
her
childhood
's
convent
*NL*
with
the
tale
of
Edward
's
infidelities
with
the
Spanish
dancer
,
and
all
*NL*
that
the
old
nun
,
who
appeared
to
her
to
be
infinitely
wise
,
mystic
and
*NL*
reverend
,
had
done
had
been
to
shake
her
head
sadly
and
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
are
like
that
.
By
the
blessing
of
God
it
will
all
come
right
in
the
*NL*
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
what
was
put
before
her
by
her
spiritual
advisers
as
her
*NL*
programme
in
life
.
Or
,
at
any
rate
,
that
was
how
their
teachings
came
*NL*
through
to
her
--
that
was
the
lesson
she
told
me
she
had
learned
of
them
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
exactly
what
they
taught
her
.
The
lot
of
women
was
patience
*NL*
and
patience
and
again
patience
--
ad
majorem
Dei
gloriam
--
until
upon
the
*NL*
appointed
day
,
if
God
saw
fit
,
she
should
have
her
reward
.
If
then
,
in
*NL*
the
end
,
she
should
have
succeeded
in
getting
Edward
back
she
would
have
*NL*
kept
her
man
within
the
limits
that
are
all
that
wifehood
has
to
expect
.
*NL*
She
was
even
taught
that
such
excesses
in
men
are
natural
,
excusable
--
as
*NL*
if
they
had
been
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
great
thing
was
that
there
should
be
no
scandal
before
the
*NL*
congregation
.
So
she
had
clung
to
the
idea
of
getting
Edward
back
with
a
*NL*
fierce
passion
that
was
like
an
agony
.
She
had
looked
the
other
way
;
she
*NL*
had
occupied
herself
solely
with
one
idea
.
That
was
the
idea
of
having
*NL*
Edward
appear
,
when
she
did
get
him
back
,
wealthy
,
glorious
as
it
were
,
*NL*
on
account
of
his
lands
,
and
upright
.
She
would
show
,
in
fact
,
that
in
*NL*
an
unfaithful
world
one
Catholic
woman
had
succeeded
in
retaining
the
*NL*
fidelity
of
her
husband
.
And
she
thought
she
had
come
near
her
desires
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
plan
with
regard
to
Maisie
had
appeared
to
be
working
admirably
.
*NL*
Edward
had
seemed
to
be
cooling
off
towards
the
girl
.
He
did
not
*NL*
hunger
to
pass
every
minute
of
the
time
at
Nauheirn
beside
the
child
's
*NL*
recumbent
form
;
he
went
out
to
polo
matches
;
he
played
auction
bridge
*NL*
in
the
evenings
;
he
was
cheerful
and
bright
.
She
was
certain
that
he
was
*NL*
not
trying
to
seduce
that
poor
child
;
she
was
beginning
to
think
that
*NL*
he
had
never
tried
to
do
so
.
He
seemed
in
fact
to
be
dropping
back
*NL*
into
what
he
had
been
for
Maisie
in
the
beginning
--
a
kind
,
attentive
,
*NL*
superior
officer
in
the
regiment
,
paying
gallant
attentions
to
a
bride
.
*NL*
They
were
as
open
in
their
little
flirtations
as
the
dayspring
from
on
*NL*
high
.
And
Maisie
had
not
appeared
to
fret
when
he
went
off
on
excursions
*NL*
with
us
;
she
had
to
lie
down
for
so
many
hours
on
her
bed
every
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
she
had
not
appeared
to
crave
for
the
attentions
of
*NL*
Edward
at
those
times
.
And
Edward
was
beginning
to
make
little
advances
*NL*
to
Leonora
.
Once
or
twice
,
in
private
--
for
he
often
did
it
before
*NL*
people
--
he
had
said
:
``
How
nice
you
look
!
''
or
``
What
a
pretty
dress
!
''
*NL*
She
had
gone
with
Florence
to
Frankfurt
,
where
they
dress
as
well
as
*NL*
in
Paris
,
and
had
got
herself
a
gown
or
two
.
She
could
afford
it
,
and
*NL*
Florence
was
an
excellent
adviser
as
to
dress
.
She
seemed
to
have
got
*NL*
hold
of
the
clue
to
the
riddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
Leonora
seemed
to
have
got
hold
of
the
clue
to
the
riddle
.
She
*NL*
imagined
herself
to
have
been
in
the
wrong
to
some
extent
in
the
past
.
*NL*
She
should
not
have
kept
Edward
on
such
a
tight
rein
with
regard
to
*NL*
money
.
She
thought
she
was
on
the
right
tack
in
letting
him
--
as
she
*NL*
had
done
only
with
fear
and
irresolution
--
have
again
the
control
of
his
*NL*
income
.
He
came
even
a
step
towards
her
and
acknowledged
,
spontaneously
,
*NL*
that
she
had
been
right
in
husbanding
,
for
all
those
years
,
their
*NL*
resources
.
He
said
to
her
one
day
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
done
right
,
old
girl
.
There
's
nothing
I
like
so
much
as
to
have
*NL*
a
little
to
chuck
away
.
And
I
can
do
it
,
thanks
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
really
,
she
said
,
the
happiest
moment
of
her
life
.
And
he
,
*NL*
seeming
to
realize
it
,
had
ventured
to
pat
her
on
the
shoulder
.
He
had
,
*NL*
ostensibly
,
come
in
to
borrow
a
safety-pin
of
her
.
And
the
occasion
of
*NL*
her
boxing
Maisie
's
ears
,
had
,
after
it
was
over
,
riveted
in
her
mind
*NL*
the
idea
that
there
was
no
intrigue
between
Edward
and
Mrs
Maidan
.
She
*NL*
imagined
that
,
from
henceforward
,
all
that
she
had
to
do
was
to
keep
him
*NL*
well
supplied
with
money
and
his
mind
amused
with
pretty
girls
.
She
was
*NL*
convinced
that
he
was
coming
back
to
her
.
For
that
month
she
no
longer
*NL*
repelled
his
timid
advances
that
never
went
very
far
.
For
he
certainly
*NL*
made
timid
advances
.
He
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
;
he
whispered
into
*NL*
her
ear
little
jokes
about
the
odd
figures
that
they
saw
up
at
the
*NL*
Casino
.
It
was
not
much
to
make
a
little
joke
--
but
the
whispering
of
it
*NL*
was
a
precious
intimacy
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
--
smash
--
it
all
went
.
It
went
to
pieces
at
the
moment
when
*NL*
Florence
laid
her
hand
upon
Edward
's
wrist
,
as
it
lay
on
the
glass
*NL*
sheltering
the
manuscript
of
the
Protest
,
up
in
the
high
tower
with
the
*NL*
shutters
where
the
sunlight
here
and
there
streamed
in
.
Or
,
rather
,
it
*NL*
went
when
she
noticed
the
look
in
Edward
's
eyes
as
he
gazed
back
into
*NL*
Florence
's
.
She
knew
that
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
known
--
since
the
first
moment
of
their
meeting
,
since
the
moment
*NL*
of
our
all
sitting
down
to
dinner
together
--
that
Florence
was
*NL*
making
eyes
at
Edward
.
But
she
had
seen
so
many
women
make
eyes
at
*NL*
Edward
--
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
women
,
in
railway
trains
,
in
hotels
,
*NL*
aboard
liners
,
at
street
corners
.
And
she
had
arrived
at
thinking
that
*NL*
Edward
took
little
stock
in
women
that
made
eyes
at
him
.
She
had
formed
*NL*
what
was
,
at
that
time
,
a
fairly
correct
estimate
of
the
methods
of
,
*NL*
the
reasons
for
,
Edward
's
loves
.
She
was
certain
that
hitherto
they
had
*NL*
consisted
of
the
short
passion
for
the
Dolciquita
,
the
real
sort
of
*NL*
love
for
Mrs
Basil
,
and
what
she
deemed
the
pretty
courtship
of
Maisie
*NL*
Maidan
.
Besides
she
despised
Florence
so
haughtily
that
she
could
not
*NL*
imagine
Edward
's
being
attracted
by
her
.
And
she
and
Maisie
were
a
*NL*
sort
of
bulwark
round
him
.
She
wanted
,
besides
,
to
keep
her
eyes
on
*NL*
Florence
--
for
Florence
knew
that
she
had
boxed
Maisie
's
ears
.
And
*NL*
Leonora
desperately
desired
that
her
union
with
Edward
should
appear
to
*NL*
be
flawless
.
But
all
that
went
...
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
answering
gaze
of
Edward
into
Florence
's
blue
and
uplifted
*NL*
eyes
,
she
knew
that
it
had
all
gone
.
She
knew
that
that
gaze
meant
that
*NL*
those
two
had
had
long
conversations
of
an
intimate
kind
--
about
their
*NL*
likes
and
dislikes
,
about
their
natures
,
about
their
views
of
marriage
.
*NL*
She
knew
what
it
meant
that
she
,
when
we
all
four
walked
out
together
,
*NL*
had
always
been
with
me
ten
yards
ahead
of
Florence
and
Edward
.
She
did
*NL*
not
imagine
that
it
had
gone
further
than
talks
about
their
likes
and
*NL*
dislikes
,
about
their
natures
or
about
marriage
as
an
institution
.
But
,
*NL*
having
watched
Edward
all
her
life
,
she
knew
that
that
laying
on
of
*NL*
hands
,
that
answering
of
gaze
with
gaze
,
meant
that
the
thing
was
*NL*
unavoidable
.
Edward
was
such
a
serious
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
that
any
attempt
on
her
part
to
separate
those
two
would
be
to
*NL*
rivet
on
Edward
an
irrevocable
passion
;
that
,
as
I
have
before
told
*NL*
you
,
it
was
a
trick
of
Edward
's
nature
to
believe
that
the
seducing
of
a
*NL*
woman
gave
her
an
irrevocable
hold
over
him
for
life
.
And
that
touching
*NL*
of
hands
,
she
knew
,
would
give
that
woman
an
irrevocable
claim
--
to
be
*NL*
seduced
.
And
she
so
despised
Florence
that
she
would
have
preferred
it
*NL*
to
be
a
parlour-maid
.
There
are
very
decent
parlour-maids
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
suddenly
,
there
came
into
her
mind
the
conviction
that
Maisie
*NL*
Maidan
had
a
real
passion
for
Edward
;
that
this
would
break
her
*NL*
heart
--
and
that
she
,
Leonora
,
would
be
responsible
for
that
.
She
went
,
*NL*
for
the
moment
,
mad
.
She
clutched
me
by
the
wrist
;
she
dragged
me
down
*NL*
those
stairs
and
across
that
whispering
Rittersaal
with
the
high
painted
*NL*
pillars
,
the
high
painted
chimney-piece
.
I
guess
she
did
not
go
mad
*NL*
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ought
to
have
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
wife
is
a
harlot
who
is
going
to
be
my
husband
's
mistress
.
.
.
''
*NL*
That
might
have
done
the
trick
.
But
,
even
in
her
madness
,
she
was
*NL*
afraid
to
go
as
far
as
that
.
She
was
afraid
that
,
if
she
did
,
Edward
and
*NL*
Florence
would
make
a
bolt
of
it
,
and
that
,
if
they
did
that
,
she
would
*NL*
lose
forever
all
chance
of
getting
him
back
in
the
end
.
She
acted
very
*NL*
badly
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
she
was
a
tortured
soul
who
put
her
Church
before
the
interests
of
*NL*
a
Philadelphia
Quaker
.
That
is
all
right
--
I
daresay
the
Church
of
Rome
*NL*
is
the
more
important
of
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
after
Maisie
Maidan
's
death
she
was
aware
that
Florence
had
*NL*
become
Edward
's
mistress
.
She
waited
outside
Florence
's
door
and
met
*NL*
Edward
as
he
came
away
.
She
said
nothing
and
he
only
grunted
.
But
I
*NL*
guess
he
had
a
bad
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
the
mental
deterioration
that
Florence
worked
in
Leonora
was
*NL*
extraordinary
;
it
smashed
up
her
whole
life
and
all
her
chances
.
It
*NL*
made
her
,
in
the
first
place
,
hopeless
--
for
she
could
not
see
how
,
after
*NL*
that
,
Edward
could
return
to
her
--
after
a
vulgar
intrigue
with
a
vulgar
*NL*
woman
.
His
affair
with
Mrs
Basil
,
which
was
now
all
that
she
had
to
*NL*
bring
,
in
her
heart
,
against
him
,
she
could
not
find
it
in
her
to
call
*NL*
an
intrigue
.
It
was
a
love
affair
--
a
pure
enough
thing
in
its
way
.
But
*NL*
this
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
horror
--
a
wantonness
,
all
the
more
detestable
*NL*
to
her
,
because
she
so
detested
Florence
.
And
Florence
talked
...
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
what
was
terrible
,
because
Florence
forced
Leonora
herself
to
*NL*
abandon
her
high
reserve
--
Florence
and
the
situation
.
It
appears
that
*NL*
Florence
was
in
two
minds
whether
to
confess
to
me
or
to
Leonora
.
*NL*
Confess
she
had
to
.
And
she
pitched
at
last
on
Leonora
,
because
if
it
*NL*
had
been
me
she
would
have
had
to
confess
a
great
deal
more
.
Or
,
at
*NL*
least
,
I
might
have
guessed
a
great
deal
more
,
about
her
``
heart
''
,
*NL*
and
about
Jimmy
.
So
she
went
to
Leonora
one
day
and
began
hinting
and
*NL*
hinting
.
And
she
enraged
Leonora
to
such
an
extent
that
at
last
Leonora
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
tell
me
that
you
are
Edward
's
mistress
.
You
can
be
.
I
have
*NL*
no
use
for
him
.
''
That
was
really
a
calamity
for
Leonora
,
because
,
once
*NL*
started
,
there
was
no
stopping
the
talking
.
She
tried
to
stop
--
but
*NL*
it
was
not
to
be
done
.
She
found
it
necessary
to
send
Edward
messages
*NL*
through
Florence
;
for
she
would
not
speak
to
him
.
She
had
to
give
him
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
to
understand
that
if
I
ever
came
to
know
of
his
intrigue
*NL*
she
would
ruin
him
beyond
repair
.
And
it
complicated
matters
a
good
deal
*NL*
that
Edward
,
at
about
this
time
,
was
really
a
little
in
love
with
her
.
*NL*
He
thought
that
he
had
treated
her
so
badly
;
that
she
was
so
fine
.
She
*NL*
was
so
mournful
that
he
longed
to
comfort
her
,
and
he
thought
himself
*NL*
such
a
blackguard
that
there
was
nothing
he
would
not
have
done
to
make
*NL*
amends
.
And
Florence
communicated
these
items
of
information
to
Leonora
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
in
the
least
blame
Leonora
for
her
coarseness
to
Florence
;
it
*NL*
must
have
done
Florence
a
world
of
good
.
But
I
do
blame
her
for
giving
*NL*
way
to
what
was
in
the
end
a
desire
for
communicativeness
.
You
see
that
*NL*
business
cut
her
off
from
her
Church
.
She
did
not
want
to
confess
what
*NL*
she
was
doing
because
she
was
afraid
that
her
spiritual
advisers
*NL*
would
blame
her
for
deceiving
me
.
I
rather
imagine
that
she
would
have
*NL*
preferred
damnation
to
breaking
my
heart
.
That
is
what
it
works
out
at
.
*NL*
She
need
not
have
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
having
no
priests
to
talk
to
,
she
had
to
talk
to
someone
,
and
*NL*
as
Florence
insisted
on
talking
to
her
,
she
talked
back
,
in
short
,
*NL*
explosive
sentences
,
like
one
of
the
damned
.
Precisely
like
one
of
the
*NL*
damned
.
Well
,
if
a
pretty
period
in
hell
on
this
earth
can
spare
her
*NL*
any
period
of
pain
in
Eternity
--
where
there
are
not
any
periods
--
I
guess
*NL*
Leonora
will
escape
hell
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
conversations
with
Florence
would
be
like
this
.
Florence
would
*NL*
happen
in
on
her
,
whilst
she
was
doing
her
wonderful
hair
,
with
a
*NL*
proposition
from
Edward
,
who
seems
about
that
time
to
have
conceived
the
*NL*
naive
idea
that
he
might
become
a
polygamist
.
I
daresay
it
was
Florence
*NL*
who
put
it
into
his
head
.
Anyhow
,
I
am
not
responsible
for
the
oddities
*NL*
of
the
human
psychology
.
But
it
certainly
appears
that
at
about
that
*NL*
date
Edward
cared
more
for
Leonora
than
he
had
ever
done
before
--
or
,
*NL*
at
any
rate
,
for
a
long
time
.
And
,
if
Leonora
had
been
a
person
to
play
*NL*
cards
and
if
she
had
played
her
cards
well
,
and
if
she
had
had
no
sense
*NL*
of
shame
and
so
on
,
she
might
then
have
shared
Edward
with
Florence
*NL*
until
the
time
came
for
jerking
that
poor
cuckoo
out
of
the
nest
.
Well
,
*NL*
Florence
would
come
to
Leonora
with
some
such
proposition
.
I
do
not
mean
*NL*
to
say
that
she
put
it
baldly
,
like
that
.
She
stood
out
that
she
was
not
*NL*
Edward
's
mistress
until
Leonora
said
that
she
had
seen
Edward
coming
out
*NL*
of
her
room
at
an
advanced
hour
of
the
night
.
That
checked
Florence
*NL*
a
bit
;
but
she
fell
back
upon
her
``
heart
''
and
stuck
out
that
she
had
*NL*
merely
been
conversing
with
Edward
in
order
to
bring
him
to
a
better
*NL*
frame
of
mind
.
Florence
had
,
of
course
,
to
stick
to
that
story
;
for
even
*NL*
Florence
would
not
have
had
the
face
to
implore
Leonora
to
grant
her
*NL*
favours
to
Edward
if
she
had
admitted
that
she
was
Edward
's
mistress
.
*NL*
That
could
not
be
done
.
At
the
same
time
Florence
had
such
a
pressing
*NL*
desire
to
talk
about
something
.
There
would
have
been
nothing
else
to
*NL*
talk
about
but
a
rapprochement
between
that
estranged
pair
.
So
Florence
*NL*
would
go
on
babbling
and
Leonora
would
go
on
brushing
her
hair
.
And
then
*NL*
Leonora
would
say
suddenly
something
like
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
myself
defiled
if
Edward
touched
me
now
that
he
has
*NL*
touched
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
would
discourage
Florence
a
bit
;
but
after
a
week
or
so
,
on
another
*NL*
morning
she
would
have
another
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
even
in
other
things
Leonora
deteriorated
.
She
had
promised
Edward
*NL*
to
leave
the
spending
of
his
own
income
in
his
own
hands
.
And
she
had
*NL*
fully
meant
to
do
that
.
I
daresay
she
would
have
done
it
too
;
though
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
she
would
have
spied
upon
his
banking
account
in
secret
.
She
*NL*
was
not
a
Roman
Catholic
for
nothing
.
But
she
took
so
serious
a
view
*NL*
of
Edward
's
unfaithfulness
to
the
memory
of
poor
little
Maisie
that
she
*NL*
could
not
trust
him
any
more
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
when
she
got
back
to
Branshaw
she
started
,
after
less
than
a
month
,
*NL*
to
worry
him
about
the
minutest
items
of
his
expenditure
.
She
allowed
*NL*
him
to
draw
his
own
cheques
,
but
there
was
hardly
a
cheque
that
she
did
*NL*
not
scrutinize
--
except
for
a
private
account
of
about
five
hundred
a
*NL*
year
which
,
tacitly
,
she
allowed
him
to
keep
for
expenditure
on
his
*NL*
mistress
or
mistresses
.
He
had
to
have
his
jaunts
to
Paris
;
he
had
to
*NL*
send
expensive
cables
in
cipher
to
Florence
about
twice
a
week
.
But
she
*NL*
worried
him
about
his
expenditure
on
wines
,
on
fruit
trees
,
on
harness
,
*NL*
on
gates
,
on
the
account
at
his
blacksmith
's
for
work
done
to
a
new
*NL*
patent
Army
stirrup
that
he
was
trying
to
invent
.
She
could
not
see
*NL*
why
he
should
bother
to
invent
a
new
Army
stirrup
,
and
she
was
really
*NL*
enraged
when
,
after
the
invention
was
mature
,
he
made
a
present
to
the
*NL*
War
Office
of
the
designs
and
the
patent
rights
.
It
was
a
remarkably
*NL*
good
stirrup
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
told
you
,
I
think
,
that
Edward
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
,
*NL*
and
about
two
hundred
pounds
for
law
fees
on
getting
a
poor
girl
,
the
*NL*
daughter
of
one
of
his
gardeners
,
acquitted
of
a
charge
of
murdering
her
*NL*
baby
.
That
was
positively
the
last
act
of
Edward
's
life
.
It
came
at
a
*NL*
time
when
Nancy
Rufford
was
on
her
way
to
India
;
when
the
most
horrible
*NL*
gloom
was
over
the
household
;
when
Edward
himself
was
in
an
agony
and
*NL*
behaving
as
prettily
as
he
knew
how
.
Yet
even
then
Leonora
made
him
a
*NL*
terrible
scene
about
this
expenditure
of
time
and
trouble
.
She
sort
of
*NL*
had
the
vague
idea
that
what
had
passed
with
the
girl
and
the
rest
of
*NL*
it
ought
to
have
taught
Edward
a
lesson
--
the
lesson
of
economy
.
She
*NL*
threatened
to
take
his
banking
account
away
from
him
again
.
I
guess
that
*NL*
made
him
cut
his
throat
.
He
might
have
stuck
it
out
otherwise
--
but
the
*NL*
thought
that
he
had
lost
Nancy
and
that
,
in
addition
,
there
was
nothing
*NL*
left
for
him
but
a
dreary
,
dreary
succession
of
days
in
which
he
could
*NL*
be
of
no
public
service
...
Well
,
it
finished
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
those
years
that
Leonora
tried
to
get
up
a
love
affair
of
*NL*
her
own
with
a
fellow
called
Bayham
--
a
decent
sort
of
fellow
.
A
really
*NL*
nice
man
.
But
the
affair
was
no
sort
of
success
.
I
have
told
you
about
*NL*
it
already
...
.
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
WELL
,
that
about
brings
me
up
to
the
date
of
my
receiving
,
in
Waterbury
,
*NL*
the
laconic
cable
from
Edward
to
the
effect
that
he
wanted
me
to
go
to
*NL*
Branshaw
and
have
a
chat
.
I
was
pretty
busy
at
the
time
and
I
was
half
*NL*
minded
to
send
him
a
reply
cable
to
the
effect
that
I
would
start
in
*NL*
a
fortnight
.
But
I
was
having
a
long
interview
with
old
Mr
Hurlbird
's
*NL*
attorneys
and
immediately
afterwards
I
had
to
have
a
long
interview
with
*NL*
the
Misses
Hurlbird
,
so
I
delayed
cabling
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
expected
to
find
the
Misses
Hurlbird
excessively
old
--
in
the
*NL*
nineties
or
thereabouts
.
The
time
had
passed
so
slowly
that
I
had
the
*NL*
impression
that
it
must
have
been
thirty
years
since
I
had
been
in
the
*NL*
United
States
.
It
was
only
twelve
years
.
Actually
Miss
Hurlbird
was
just
*NL*
sixty-one
and
Miss
Florence
Hurlbird
fifty-nine
,
and
they
were
both
,
*NL*
mentally
and
physically
,
as
vigorous
as
could
be
desired
.
They
were
,
*NL*
indeed
,
more
vigorous
,
mentally
,
than
suited
my
purpose
,
which
was
to
*NL*
get
away
from
the
United
States
as
quickly
as
I
could
.
The
Hurlbirds
*NL*
were
an
exceedingly
united
family
--
exceedingly
united
except
on
one
set
*NL*
of
points
.
Each
of
the
three
of
them
had
a
separate
doctor
,
whom
they
*NL*
trusted
implicitly
--
and
each
had
a
separate
attorney
.
And
each
of
them
*NL*
distrusted
the
other
's
doctor
and
the
other
's
attorney
.
And
,
naturally
,
*NL*
the
doctors
and
the
attorneys
warned
one
all
the
time
--
against
each
*NL*
other
.
You
can
not
imagine
how
complicated
it
all
became
for
me
.
Of
*NL*
course
I
had
an
attorney
of
my
own
--
recommended
to
me
by
young
Carter
,
*NL*
my
Philadelphia
nephew
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
there
was
any
unpleasantness
of
a
grasping
*NL*
kind
.
The
problem
was
quite
another
one
--
a
moral
dilemma
.
You
see
,
old
*NL*
Mr
Hurlbird
had
left
all
his
property
to
Florence
with
the
mere
request
*NL*
that
she
would
have
erected
to
him
in
the
city
of
Waterbury
,
Ill.
,
a
*NL*
memorial
that
should
take
the
form
of
some
sort
of
institution
for
the
*NL*
relief
of
sufferers
from
the
heart
.
Florence
's
money
had
all
come
to
*NL*
me
--
and
with
it
old
Mr
Hurlbird
's
.
He
had
died
just
five
days
before
*NL*
Florence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
was
quite
ready
to
spend
a
round
million
dollars
on
the
relief
*NL*
of
sufferers
from
the
heart
.
The
old
gentleman
had
left
about
a
million
*NL*
and
a
half
;
Florence
had
been
worth
about
eight
hundred
thousand
--
and
*NL*
as
I
figured
it
out
,
I
should
cut
up
at
about
a
million
myself
.
Anyhow
,
*NL*
there
was
ample
money
.
But
I
naturally
wanted
to
consult
the
wishes
of
*NL*
his
surviving
relatives
and
then
the
trouble
really
began
.
You
see
,
it
*NL*
had
been
discovered
that
Mr
Hurlbird
had
had
nothing
whatever
the
matter
*NL*
with
his
heart
.
His
lungs
had
been
a
little
affected
all
through
his
*NL*
life
and
he
had
died
of
bronchitis
.
It
struck
Miss
Florence
Hurlbird
*NL*
that
,
since
her
brother
had
died
of
lungs
and
not
of
heart
,
his
money
*NL*
ought
to
go
to
lung
patients
.
That
,
she
considered
,
was
what
her
brother
*NL*
would
have
wished
.
On
the
other
hand
,
by
a
kink
,
that
I
could
not
at
the
*NL*
time
understand
,
Miss
Hurlbird
insisted
that
I
ought
to
keep
the
money
*NL*
all
to
myself
.
She
said
that
she
did
not
wish
for
any
monuments
to
the
*NL*
Hurlbird
family
.
At
the
time
I
thought
that
that
was
because
of
a
New
*NL*
England
dislike
for
necrological
ostentation
.
But
I
can
figure
out
now
,
*NL*
when
I
remember
certain
insistent
and
continued
questions
that
she
put
*NL*
to
me
,
about
Edward
Ashburnham
,
that
there
was
another
idea
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
And
Leonora
has
told
me
that
,
on
Florence
's
dressing-table
,
beside
her
*NL*
dead
body
,
there
had
lain
a
letter
to
Miss
Hurlbird
--
a
letter
which
*NL*
Leonora
posted
without
telling
me
.
I
do
n't
know
how
Florence
had
time
to
*NL*
write
to
her
aunt
;
but
I
can
quite
understand
that
she
would
not
like
*NL*
to
go
out
of
the
world
without
making
some
comments
.
So
I
guess
Florence
*NL*
had
told
Miss
Hurlbird
a
good
bit
about
Edward
Ashburnham
in
a
few
*NL*
scrawled
words
--
and
that
that
was
why
the
old
lady
did
not
wish
the
name
*NL*
of
Hurlbird
perpetuated
.
Perhaps
also
she
thought
that
I
had
earned
the
*NL*
Hurlbird
money
.
It
meant
a
pretty
tidy
lot
of
discussing
,
what
with
the
*NL*
doctors
warning
each
other
about
the
bad
effects
of
discussions
on
the
*NL*
health
of
the
old
ladies
,
and
warning
me
covertly
against
each
other
,
*NL*
and
saying
that
old
Mr
Hurlbird
might
have
died
of
heart
,
after
all
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
diagnosis
of
his
doctor
.
And
the
solicitors
all
had
*NL*
separate
methods
of
arranging
about
how
the
money
should
be
invested
and
*NL*
entrusted
and
bound
.
Personally
,
I
wanted
to
invest
the
money
so
that
*NL*
the
interest
could
be
used
for
the
relief
of
sufferers
from
the
heart
.
*NL*
If
old
Mr
Hurlbird
had
not
died
of
any
defects
in
that
organ
he
had
*NL*
considered
that
it
was
defective
.
Moreover
,
Florence
had
certainly
died
*NL*
of
her
heart
,
as
I
saw
it
.
And
when
Miss
Florence
Hurlbird
stood
out
*NL*
that
the
money
ought
to
go
to
chest
sufferers
I
was
brought
to
thinking
*NL*
that
there
ought
to
be
a
chest
institution
too
,
and
I
advanced
the
sum
*NL*
that
I
was
ready
to
provide
to
a
million
and
a
half
of
dollars
.
That
*NL*
would
have
given
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
to
each
class
of
*NL*
invalid
.
I
did
not
want
money
at
all
badly
.
All
I
wanted
it
for
was
to
*NL*
be
able
to
give
Nancy
Rufford
a
good
time
.
I
did
not
know
much
about
*NL*
housekeeping
expenses
in
England
where
,
I
presumed
,
she
would
wish
*NL*
to
live
.
I
knew
that
her
needs
at
that
time
were
limited
to
good
*NL*
chocolates
,
and
a
good
horse
or
two
,
and
simple
,
pretty
frocks
.
Probably
*NL*
she
would
want
more
than
that
later
on
.
But
even
if
I
gave
a
million
and
*NL*
a
half
dollars
to
these
institutions
I
should
still
have
the
equivalent
*NL*
of
about
twenty
thousand
a
year
English
,
and
I
considered
that
Nancy
*NL*
could
have
a
pretty
good
time
on
that
or
less
.
Anyhow
,
we
had
a
stiff
*NL*
set
of
arguments
up
at
the
Hurlbird
mansion
which
stands
on
a
bluff
*NL*
over
the
town
.
It
may
strike
you
,
silent
listener
,
as
being
funny
if
you
*NL*
happen
to
be
European
.
But
moral
problems
of
that
description
and
the
*NL*
giving
of
millions
to
institutions
are
immensely
serious
matters
in
my
*NL*
country
.
Indeed
,
they
are
the
staple
topics
for
consideration
amongst
*NL*
the
wealthy
classes
.
We
have
n't
got
peerage
and
social
climbing
to
*NL*
occupy
us
much
,
and
decent
people
do
not
take
interest
in
politics
or
*NL*
elderly
people
in
sport
.
So
that
there
were
real
tears
shed
by
both
*NL*
Miss
Hurlbird
and
Miss
Florence
before
I
left
that
city
.
I
left
it
quite
*NL*
abruptly
.
Four
hours
after
Edward
's
telegram
came
another
from
Leonora
,
*NL*
saying
:
``
Yes
,
do
come
.
You
could
be
so
helpful
.
''
I
simply
told
my
*NL*
attorney
that
there
was
the
million
and
a
half
;
that
he
could
invest
*NL*
it
as
he
liked
,
and
that
the
purposes
must
be
decided
by
the
Misses
*NL*
Hurlbird
.
I
was
,
anyhow
,
pretty
well
worn
out
by
all
the
discussions
.
*NL*
And
,
as
I
have
never
heard
yet
from
the
Misses
Hurlbird
,
I
rather
*NL*
think
that
Miss
Hurlbird
,
either
by
revelations
or
by
moral
force
,
has
*NL*
persuaded
Miss
Florence
that
no
memorial
to
their
names
shall
be
erected
*NL*
in
the
city
of
Waterbury
,
Conn.
.
Miss
Hurlbird
wept
dreadfully
when
she
*NL*
heard
that
I
was
going
to
stay
with
the
Ashburnhams
,
but
she
did
not
*NL*
make
any
comments
.
I
was
aware
,
at
that
date
,
that
her
niece
had
been
*NL*
seduced
by
that
fellow
Jimmy
before
I
had
married
her
--
but
I
contrived
*NL*
to
produce
on
her
the
impression
that
I
thought
Florence
had
been
a
*NL*
model
wife
.
Why
,
at
that
date
I
still
believed
that
Florence
had
been
*NL*
perfectly
virtuous
after
her
marriage
to
me
.
I
had
not
figured
it
out
*NL*
that
she
could
have
played
it
so
low
down
as
to
continue
her
intrigue
*NL*
with
that
fellow
under
my
roof
.
Well
,
I
was
a
fool
.
But
I
did
not
think
*NL*
much
about
Florence
at
that
date
.
My
mind
was
occupied
with
what
was
*NL*
happening
at
Branshaw
.
I
had
got
it
into
my
head
that
the
telegrams
had
*NL*
something
to
do
with
Nancy
.
It
struck
me
that
she
might
have
shown
signs
*NL*
of
forming
an
attachment
for
some
undesirable
fellow
and
that
Leonora
*NL*
wanted
me
to
come
back
and
marry
her
out
of
harm
's
way
.
That
was
what
*NL*
was
pretty
firmly
in
my
mind
.
And
it
remained
in
my
mind
for
nearly
ten
*NL*
days
after
my
arrival
at
that
beautiful
old
place
.
Neither
Edward
nor
*NL*
Leonora
made
any
motion
to
talk
to
me
about
anything
other
than
the
*NL*
weather
and
the
crops
.
Yet
,
although
there
were
several
young
fellows
*NL*
about
,
I
could
not
see
that
any
one
in
particular
was
distinguished
by
*NL*
the
girl
's
preference
.
She
certainly
appeared
illish
and
nervous
,
except
*NL*
when
she
woke
up
to
talk
gay
nonsense
to
me
.
Oh
,
the
pretty
thing
that
*NL*
she
was
...
*NL*
*NL*
I
imagined
that
what
must
have
happened
was
that
the
undesirable
young
*NL*
man
had
been
forbidden
the
place
and
that
Nancy
was
fretting
a
little
.
*NL*
What
had
happened
was
just
Hell
.
Leonora
had
spoken
to
Nancy
;
Nancy
had
*NL*
spoken
to
Edward
;
Edward
had
spoken
to
Leonora
--
and
they
had
talked
and
*NL*
talked
.
And
talked
.
You
have
to
imagine
horrible
pictures
of
gloom
and
*NL*
half
lights
,
and
emotions
running
through
silent
nights
--
through
whole
*NL*
nights
.
You
have
to
imagine
my
beautiful
Nancy
appearing
suddenly
to
*NL*
Edward
,
rising
up
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
,
with
her
long
hair
falling
,
*NL*
like
a
split
cone
of
shadow
,
in
the
glimmer
of
a
night-light
that
burned
*NL*
beside
him
.
You
have
to
imagine
her
,
a
silent
,
a
no
doubt
agonized
*NL*
figure
,
like
a
spectre
,
suddenly
offering
herself
to
him
--
to
save
his
*NL*
reason
!
And
you
have
to
imagine
his
frantic
refusal
--
and
talk
.
And
talk
!
*NL*
My
God
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
to
me
,
living
in
the
house
,
enveloped
with
the
charm
of
the
*NL*
quiet
and
ordered
living
,
with
the
silent
,
skilled
servants
whose
mere
*NL*
laying
out
of
my
dress
clothes
was
like
a
caress
--
to
me
who
was
hourly
*NL*
with
them
they
appeared
like
tender
,
ordered
and
devoted
people
,
*NL*
smiling
,
absenting
themselves
at
the
proper
intervals
;
driving
me
to
*NL*
meets
--
just
good
people
!
How
the
devil
--
how
the
devil
do
they
do
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
one
evening
Leonora
said
--
she
had
just
opened
a
telegram
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nancy
will
be
going
to
India
,
tomorrow
,
to
be
with
her
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
spoke
.
Nancy
looked
at
her
plate
;
Edward
went
on
eating
his
*NL*
pheasant
.
I
felt
very
bad
;
I
imagined
that
it
would
be
up
to
me
to
*NL*
propose
to
Nancy
that
evening
.
It
appeared
to
me
to
be
queer
that
they
*NL*
had
not
given
me
any
warning
of
Nancy
's
departure
--
But
I
thought
that
*NL*
that
was
only
English
manners
--
some
sort
of
delicacy
that
I
had
not
got
*NL*
the
hang
of
.
You
must
remember
that
at
that
moment
I
trusted
in
Edward
*NL*
and
Leonora
and
in
Nancy
Rufford
,
and
in
the
tranquility
of
ancient
*NL*
haunts
of
peace
,
as
I
had
trusted
in
my
mother
's
love
.
And
that
evening
*NL*
Edward
spoke
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
in
the
interval
had
happened
had
been
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
her
return
from
Nauheim
Leonora
had
completely
broken
down
--
because
*NL*
she
knew
she
could
trust
Edward
.
That
seems
odd
but
,
if
you
know
*NL*
anything
about
breakdowns
,
you
will
know
that
by
the
ingenious
torments
*NL*
that
fate
prepares
for
us
,
these
things
come
as
soon
as
,
a
strain
having
*NL*
relaxed
,
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
.
It
is
after
a
husband
's
long
*NL*
illness
and
death
that
a
widow
goes
to
pieces
;
it
is
at
the
end
of
a
*NL*
long
rowing
contest
that
a
crew
collapses
and
lies
forward
upon
its
*NL*
oars
.
And
that
was
what
happened
to
Leonora
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
certain
tones
in
Edward
's
voice
;
from
the
long
,
steady
stare
that
*NL*
he
had
given
her
from
his
bloodshot
eyes
on
rising
from
the
dinner
table
*NL*
in
the
Nauheim
hotel
,
she
knew
that
,
in
the
affair
of
the
poor
girl
,
*NL*
this
was
a
case
in
which
Edward
's
moral
scruples
,
or
his
social
code
,
*NL*
or
his
idea
that
it
would
be
playing
it
too
low
down
,
rendered
Nancy
*NL*
perfectly
safe
.
The
girl
,
she
felt
sure
,
was
in
no
danger
at
all
from
*NL*
Edward
.
And
in
that
she
was
perfectly
right
.
The
smash
was
to
come
from
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
relaxed
;
she
broke
;
she
drifted
,
at
first
quickly
,
then
with
an
*NL*
increasing
momentum
,
down
the
stream
of
destiny
.
You
may
put
it
that
,
*NL*
having
been
cut
off
from
the
restraints
of
her
religion
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
her
life
,
she
acted
along
the
lines
of
her
instinctive
desires
.
*NL*
I
do
not
know
whether
to
think
that
,
in
that
she
was
no
longer
herself
;
*NL*
or
that
,
having
let
loose
the
bonds
of
her
standards
,
her
conventions
*NL*
and
her
traditions
,
she
was
being
,
for
the
first
time
,
her
own
natural
*NL*
self
.
She
was
torn
between
her
intense
,
maternal
love
for
the
girl
and
*NL*
an
intense
jealousy
of
the
woman
who
realizes
that
the
man
she
loves
has
*NL*
met
what
appears
to
be
the
final
passion
of
his
life
.
She
was
divided
*NL*
between
an
intense
disgust
for
Edward
's
weakness
in
conceiving
this
*NL*
passion
,
an
intense
pity
for
the
miseries
that
he
was
enduring
,
and
a
*NL*
feeling
equally
intense
,
but
one
that
she
hid
from
herself
--
a
feeling
of
*NL*
respect
for
Edward
's
determination
to
keep
himself
,
in
this
particular
*NL*
affair
,
unspotted
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
human
heart
is
a
very
mysterious
thing
.
It
is
impossible
to
say
*NL*
that
Leonora
,
in
acting
as
she
then
did
,
was
not
filled
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
hatred
of
Edward
's
final
virtue
.
She
wanted
,
I
think
,
to
despise
him
.
He
*NL*
was
,
she
realized
gone
from
her
for
good
.
Then
let
him
suffer
,
let
him
*NL*
agonize
;
let
him
,
if
possible
,
break
and
go
to
that
Hell
that
is
the
*NL*
abode
of
broken
resolves
.
She
might
have
taken
a
different
line
.
It
*NL*
would
have
been
so
easy
to
send
the
girl
away
to
stay
with
some
friends
;
*NL*
to
have
taken
her
away
herself
upon
some
pretext
or
other
.
That
would
*NL*
not
have
cured
things
but
it
would
have
been
the
decent
line
,
...
But
,
at
*NL*
that
date
,
poor
Leonora
was
incapable
of
taking
any
line
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pitied
Edward
frightfully
at
one
time
--
and
then
she
acted
along
*NL*
the
lines
of
pity
;
she
loathed
him
at
another
and
then
she
acted
as
her
*NL*
loathing
dictated
.
She
gasped
,
as
a
person
dying
of
tuberculosis
gasps
*NL*
for
air
.
She
craved
madly
for
communication
with
some
other
human
soul
.
*NL*
And
the
human
soul
that
she
selected
was
that
of
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Nancy
was
the
only
person
that
she
could
have
talked
to
.
With
*NL*
her
necessity
for
reticences
,
with
her
coldness
of
manner
,
Leonora
had
*NL*
singularly
few
intimates
.
She
had
none
at
all
,
with
the
exception
of
*NL*
the
Mrs
Colonel
Whelen
,
who
had
advised
her
about
the
affair
with
La
*NL*
Dolciquita
,
and
the
one
or
two
religious
,
who
had
guided
her
through
*NL*
life
.
The
Colonel
's
wife
was
at
that
time
in
Madeira
;
the
religious
she
*NL*
now
avoided
.
Her
visitors
'
book
had
seven
hundred
names
in
it
;
there
was
*NL*
not
a
soul
that
she
could
speak
to
.
She
was
Mrs
Ashburnham
of
Branshaw
*NL*
Teleragh
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
great
Mrs
Ashburnham
of
Branshaw
and
she
lay
all
day
upon
*NL*
her
bed
in
her
marvellous
,
light
,
airy
bedroom
with
the
chintzes
and
*NL*
the
Chippendale
and
the
portraits
of
deceased
Ashburnhams
by
Zoffany
and
*NL*
Zucchero
.
When
there
was
a
meet
she
would
struggle
up
--
supposing
it
were
*NL*
within
driving
distance
--
and
let
Edward
drive
her
and
the
girl
to
the
*NL*
cross-roads
or
the
country
house
.
She
would
drive
herself
back
alone
;
*NL*
Edward
would
ride
off
with
the
girl
.
Ride
Leonora
could
not
,
that
*NL*
season
--
her
head
was
too
bad
.
Each
pace
of
her
mare
was
an
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
drove
with
efficiency
and
precision
;
she
smiled
at
the
Gimmers
*NL*
and
Ffoulkes
and
the
Hedley
Seatons
.
She
threw
with
exactitude
pennies
*NL*
to
the
boys
who
opened
gates
for
her
;
she
sat
upright
on
the
seat
of
the
*NL*
high
dog-cart
;
she
waved
her
hands
to
Edward
and
Nancy
as
they
rode
off
*NL*
with
the
hounds
,
and
every
one
could
hear
her
clear
,
high
voice
,
in
the
*NL*
chilly
weather
,
saying
:
``
Have
a
good
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
forlorn
woman
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
however
,
one
spark
of
consolation
.
It
came
from
the
fact
that
*NL*
Rodney
Bayham
,
of
Bayham
,
followed
her
always
with
his
eyes
.
It
had
been
*NL*
three
years
since
she
had
tried
her
abortive
love-affair
with
him
.
Yet
*NL*
still
,
on
the
winter
mornings
he
would
ride
up
to
her
shafts
and
just
*NL*
say
:
``
Good
day
,
''
and
look
at
her
with
eyes
that
were
not
imploring
,
*NL*
but
seemed
to
say
:
``
You
see
,
I
am
still
,
as
the
Germans
say
,
A.
D.
--
at
*NL*
disposition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
consolation
,
not
because
she
proposed
ever
to
take
him
*NL*
up
again
,
but
because
it
showed
her
that
there
was
in
the
world
one
*NL*
faithful
soul
in
riding-breeches
.
And
it
showed
her
that
she
was
not
*NL*
losing
her
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
she
was
not
losing
her
looks
.
She
was
forty
,
but
she
was
as
*NL*
clean
run
as
on
the
day
she
had
left
the
convent
--
as
clear
in
outline
,
*NL*
as
clear
coloured
in
the
hair
,
as
dark
blue
in
the
eyes
.
She
thought
*NL*
that
her
looking-glass
told
her
this
;
but
there
are
always
the
*NL*
doubts
...
Rodney
Bayham
's
eyes
took
them
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
very
singular
that
Leonora
should
not
have
aged
at
all
.
I
suppose
*NL*
that
there
are
some
types
of
beauty
and
even
of
youth
made
for
the
*NL*
embellishments
that
come
with
enduring
sorrow
.
That
is
too
elaborately
*NL*
put
.
I
mean
that
Leonora
,
if
everything
had
prospered
,
might
have
*NL*
become
too
hard
and
,
maybe
,
overbearing
.
As
it
was
she
was
tuned
down
*NL*
to
appearing
efficient
--
and
yet
sympathetic
.
That
is
the
rarest
of
all
*NL*
blends
.
And
yet
I
swear
that
Leonora
,
in
her
restrained
way
,
gave
the
*NL*
impression
of
being
intensely
sympathetic
.
When
she
listened
to
you
she
*NL*
appeared
also
to
be
listening
to
some
sound
that
was
going
on
in
the
*NL*
distance
.
But
still
,
she
listened
to
you
and
took
in
what
you
said
,
*NL*
which
,
since
the
record
of
humanity
is
a
record
of
sorrows
,
was
,
as
a
*NL*
rule
,
something
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
that
she
must
have
taken
Nancy
through
many
terrors
of
the
night
*NL*
and
many
bad
places
of
the
day
.
And
that
would
account
for
the
girl
's
*NL*
passionate
love
for
the
elder
woman
.
For
Nancy
's
love
for
Leonora
was
an
*NL*
admiration
that
is
awakened
in
Catholics
by
their
feeling
for
the
Virgin
*NL*
Mary
and
for
various
of
the
saints
.
It
is
too
little
to
say
that
the
*NL*
girl
would
have
laid
her
life
at
Leonora
's
feet
.
Well
,
she
laid
*NL*
there
the
offer
of
her
virtue
--
and
her
reason
.
Those
were
sufficient
*NL*
instalments
of
her
life
.
It
would
today
be
much
better
for
Nancy
Rufford
*NL*
if
she
were
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
all
these
reflections
are
a
nuisance
;
but
they
crowd
on
me
.
I
*NL*
will
try
to
tell
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
--
when
she
came
back
from
Nauheim
Leonora
began
to
have
her
*NL*
headaches
--
headaches
lasting
through
whole
days
,
during
which
she
could
*NL*
speak
no
word
and
could
bear
to
hear
no
sound
.
And
,
day
after
day
,
*NL*
Nancy
would
sit
with
her
,
silent
and
motionless
for
hours
,
steeping
*NL*
handkerchiefs
in
vinegar
and
water
,
and
thinking
her
own
thoughts
.
It
*NL*
must
have
been
very
bad
for
her
--
and
her
meals
alone
with
Edward
must
*NL*
have
been
bad
for
her
too
--
and
beastly
bad
for
Edward
.
Edward
,
of
*NL*
course
,
wavered
in
his
demeanour
,
What
else
could
he
do
?
At
times
he
*NL*
would
sit
silent
and
dejected
over
his
untouched
food
.
He
would
utter
*NL*
nothing
but
monosyllables
when
Nancy
spoke
to
him
.
Then
he
was
simply
*NL*
afraid
of
the
girl
falling
in
love
with
him
.
At
other
times
he
would
*NL*
take
a
little
wine
;
pull
himself
together
;
attempt
to
chaff
Nancy
about
*NL*
a
stake
and
binder
hedge
that
her
mare
had
checked
at
,
or
talk
about
the
*NL*
habits
of
the
Chitralis
.
That
was
when
he
was
thinking
that
it
was
*NL*
rough
on
the
poor
girl
that
he
should
have
become
a
dull
companion
.
He
*NL*
realized
that
his
talking
to
her
in
the
park
at
Nauheim
had
done
her
no
*NL*
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
that
was
doing
a
great
deal
of
harm
to
Nancy
.
It
gradually
*NL*
opened
her
eyes
to
the
fact
that
Edward
was
a
man
with
his
ups
and
downs
*NL*
and
not
an
invariably
gay
uncle
like
a
nice
dog
,
a
trustworthy
horse
or
*NL*
a
girl
friend
.
She
would
find
him
in
attitudes
of
frightful
dejection
,
*NL*
sunk
into
his
armchair
in
the
study
that
was
half
a
gun-room
.
She
would
*NL*
notice
through
the
open
door
that
his
face
was
the
face
of
an
old
,
dead
*NL*
man
,
when
he
had
no
one
to
talk
to
.
Gradually
it
forced
itself
upon
her
*NL*
attention
that
there
were
profound
differences
between
the
pair
that
she
*NL*
regarded
as
her
uncle
and
her
aunt
.
It
was
a
conviction
that
came
very
*NL*
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
with
Edward
's
giving
an
oldish
horse
to
a
young
fellow
called
*NL*
Selmes
.
Selmes
'
father
had
been
ruined
by
a
fraudulent
solicitor
and
the
*NL*
Selmes
family
had
had
to
sell
their
hunters
.
It
was
a
case
that
had
*NL*
excited
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
in
that
part
of
the
county
.
And
Edward
,
*NL*
meeting
the
young
man
one
day
,
unmounted
,
and
seeing
him
to
be
very
*NL*
unhappy
,
had
offered
to
give
him
an
old
Irish
cob
upon
which
he
was
*NL*
riding
.
It
was
a
silly
sort
of
thing
to
do
really
.
The
horse
was
worth
*NL*
from
thirty
to
forty
pounds
and
Edward
might
have
known
that
the
gift
*NL*
would
upset
his
wife
.
But
Edward
just
had
to
comfort
that
unhappy
young
*NL*
man
whose
father
he
had
known
all
his
life
.
And
what
made
it
all
the
*NL*
worse
was
that
young
Selmes
could
not
afford
to
keep
the
horse
even
.
*NL*
Edward
recollected
this
,
immediately
after
he
had
made
the
offer
,
and
*NL*
said
quickly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
mean
that
you
should
stable
the
horse
at
Branshaw
until
you
*NL*
have
time
to
turn
round
or
want
to
sell
him
and
get
a
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
went
straight
home
and
told
all
this
to
Leonora
who
was
lying
*NL*
down
.
She
regarded
it
as
a
splendid
instance
of
Edward
's
quick
*NL*
consideration
for
the
feelings
and
the
circumstances
of
the
distressed
.
*NL*
She
thought
it
would
cheer
Leonora
up
--
because
it
ought
to
cheer
any
*NL*
woman
up
to
know
that
she
had
such
a
splendid
husband
.
That
was
the
last
*NL*
girlish
thought
she
ever
had
.
For
Leonora
,
whose
headache
had
left
her
*NL*
collected
but
miserably
weak
,
turned
upon
her
bed
and
uttered
words
that
*NL*
were
amazing
to
the
girl
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
God
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
he
was
your
husband
,
and
not
mine
.
We
*NL*
shall
be
ruined
.
We
shall
be
ruined
.
Am
I
never
to
have
a
chance
?
''
And
*NL*
suddenly
Leonora
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
.
She
pushed
herself
up
*NL*
from
the
pillows
with
one
elbow
and
sat
there
--
crying
,
crying
,
crying
,
*NL*
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
and
the
tears
falling
through
her
*NL*
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
flushed
,
stammered
and
whimpered
as
if
she
had
been
personally
*NL*
insulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
Uncle
Edward
...
''
she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
,
''
said
Leonora
,
with
an
extraordinary
bitterness
,
``
would
give
*NL*
the
shirt
off
his
back
and
off
mine
--
and
off
yours
to
any
...
''
She
could
*NL*
not
finish
the
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
she
had
been
feeling
an
extraordinary
hatred
and
contempt
*NL*
for
her
husband
.
All
the
morning
and
all
the
afternoon
she
had
been
*NL*
lying
there
thinking
that
Edward
and
the
girl
were
together
--
in
the
*NL*
field
and
hacking
it
home
at
dusk
.
She
had
been
digging
her
sharp
nails
*NL*
into
her
palms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
had
been
very
silent
in
the
drooping
winter
weather
.
And
then
,
*NL*
after
an
eternity
of
torture
,
there
had
invaded
it
the
sound
of
opening
*NL*
doors
,
of
the
girl
's
gay
voice
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
only
under
the
mistletoe
.
''
...
And
there
was
Edward
's
gruff
*NL*
undertone
.
Then
Nancy
had
come
in
,
with
feet
that
had
hastened
up
the
*NL*
stairs
and
that
tiptoed
as
they
approached
the
open
door
of
Leonora
's
*NL*
room
.
Branshaw
had
a
great
big
hall
with
oak
floors
and
tiger
skins
.
*NL*
Round
this
hall
there
ran
a
gallery
upon
which
Leonora
's
doorway
gave
.
*NL*
And
even
when
she
had
the
worst
of
her
headaches
she
liked
to
have
her
*NL*
door
open
--
I
suppose
so
that
she
might
hear
the
approaching
footsteps
*NL*
of
ruin
and
disaster
.
At
any
rate
she
hated
to
be
in
a
room
with
a
shut
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Leonora
hated
Edward
with
a
hatred
that
was
like
hell
,
*NL*
and
she
would
have
liked
to
bring
her
riding-whip
down
across
the
girl
's
*NL*
face
.
What
right
had
Nancy
to
be
young
and
slender
and
dark
,
and
gay
at
*NL*
times
,
at
times
mournful
?
What
right
had
she
to
be
exactly
the
woman
*NL*
to
make
Leonora
's
husband
happy
?
For
Leonora
knew
that
Nancy
would
have
*NL*
made
Edward
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
Leonora
wished
to
bring
her
riding-whip
down
on
Nancy
's
young
face
.
*NL*
She
imagined
the
pleasure
she
would
feel
when
the
lash
fell
across
those
*NL*
queer
features
;
the
pleasure
she
would
feel
at
drawing
the
handle
at
*NL*
the
same
moment
toward
her
,
so
as
to
cut
deep
into
the
flesh
and
to
*NL*
leave
a
lasting
wheal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
she
left
a
lasting
wheal
,
and
her
words
cut
deeply
into
the
girl
's
*NL*
mind
...
*NL*
*NL*
They
neither
of
them
spoke
about
that
again
.
A
fortnight
went
by
--
a
*NL*
fortnight
of
deep
rains
,
of
heavy
fields
,
of
bad
scent
.
Leonora
's
*NL*
headaches
seemed
to
have
gone
for
good
.
She
hunted
once
or
twice
,
*NL*
letting
herself
be
piloted
by
Bayham
,
whilst
Edward
looked
after
the
*NL*
girl
.
Then
,
one
evening
,
when
those
three
were
dining
alone
,
Edward
*NL*
said
,
in
the
queer
,
deliberate
,
heavy
tones
that
came
out
of
him
in
*NL*
those
days
-LRB-
he
was
looking
at
the
table
-RRB-
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
that
Nancy
ought
to
do
more
for
her
father
.
He
is
*NL*
getting
an
old
man
.
I
have
written
to
Colonel
Rufford
,
suggesting
that
*NL*
she
should
go
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
?
How
dare
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
put
her
hand
over
her
heart
and
cried
out
:
``
Oh
,
my
sweet
*NL*
Saviour
,
help
me
''
That
was
the
queer
way
she
thought
within
her
mind
,
*NL*
and
the
words
forced
themselves
to
her
lips
.
Edward
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
night
,
by
a
merciless
trick
of
the
devil
that
pays
attention
*NL*
to
this
sweltering
hell
of
ours
,
Nancy
Rufford
had
a
letter
from
her
*NL*
mother
.
It
came
whilst
Leonora
was
talking
to
Edward
,
or
Leonora
would
*NL*
have
intercepted
it
as
she
had
intercepted
others
.
It
was
an
amazing
and
*NL*
a
horrible
letter
.
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
it
contained
.
I
just
average
out
from
its
effects
on
*NL*
Nancy
that
her
mother
,
having
eloped
with
some
worthless
sort
of
fellow
,
*NL*
had
done
what
is
called
``
sinking
lower
and
lower
''
.
Whether
she
was
*NL*
actually
on
the
streets
I
do
not
know
,
but
I
rather
think
that
she
eked
*NL*
out
a
small
allowance
that
she
had
from
her
husband
by
that
means
of
*NL*
livelihood
.
And
I
think
that
she
stated
as
much
in
her
letter
to
Nancy
*NL*
and
upbraided
the
girl
with
living
in
luxury
whilst
her
mother
starved
.
*NL*
And
it
must
have
been
horrible
in
tone
,
for
Mrs
Rufford
was
a
cruel
sort
*NL*
of
woman
at
the
best
of
times
.
It
must
have
seemed
to
that
poor
girl
,
*NL*
opening
her
letter
,
for
distraction
from
another
grief
,
up
in
her
*NL*
bedroom
,
like
the
laughter
of
a
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
just
can
not
bear
to
think
of
my
poor
dear
girl
at
that
moment
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
at
the
same
time
,
Leonora
was
lashing
,
like
a
cold
fiend
,
into
the
*NL*
unfortunate
Edward
.
Or
,
perhaps
,
he
was
not
so
unfortunate
;
because
he
*NL*
had
done
what
he
knew
to
be
the
right
thing
,
he
may
be
deemed
happy
.
*NL*
I
leave
it
to
you
.
At
any
rate
,
he
was
sitting
in
his
deep
chair
,
and
*NL*
Leonora
came
into
his
room
--
for
the
first
time
in
nine
years
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
most
atrocious
thing
you
have
done
in
your
atrocious
*NL*
life
.
''
He
never
moved
and
he
never
looked
at
her
.
God
knows
what
was
in
*NL*
Leonora
's
mind
exactly
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
like
to
think
that
,
uppermost
in
it
was
concern
and
horror
at
the
*NL*
thought
of
the
poor
girl
's
going
back
to
a
father
whose
voice
made
*NL*
her
shriek
in
the
night
.
And
,
indeed
,
that
motive
was
very
strong
with
*NL*
Leonora
.
But
I
think
there
was
also
present
the
thought
that
she
wanted
*NL*
to
go
on
torturing
Edward
with
the
girl
's
presence
.
She
was
,
at
that
*NL*
time
,
capable
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
was
sunk
in
his
chair
;
there
were
in
the
room
two
candles
,
hidden
*NL*
by
green
glass
shades
.
The
green
shades
were
reflected
in
the
glasses
*NL*
of
the
book-cases
that
contained
not
books
but
guns
with
gleaming
brown
*NL*
barrels
and
fishing-rods
in
green
baize
over-covers
.
There
was
dimly
to
*NL*
be
seen
,
above
a
mantelpiece
encumbered
with
spurs
,
hooves
and
bronze
*NL*
models
of
horses
,
a
dark-brown
picture
of
a
white
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
think
,
''
Leonora
said
,
``
that
I
do
not
know
that
you
are
in
love
*NL*
with
the
girl
...
''
She
began
spiritedly
,
but
she
could
not
find
any
*NL*
ending
for
the
sentence
.
Edward
did
not
stir
;
he
never
spoke
.
And
then
*NL*
Leonora
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
want
me
to
divorce
you
,
I
will
.
You
can
marry
her
then
.
She
's
in
*NL*
love
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
groaned
at
that
,
a
little
,
Leonora
said
.
Then
she
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heaven
knows
what
happened
in
Leonora
after
that
.
She
certainly
does
not
*NL*
herself
know
.
She
probably
said
a
good
deal
more
to
Edward
than
I
have
*NL*
been
able
to
report
;
but
that
is
all
that
she
has
told
me
and
I
am
not
*NL*
going
to
make
up
speeches
.
To
follow
her
psychological
development
of
*NL*
that
moment
I
think
we
must
allow
that
she
upbraided
him
for
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
their
past
life
,
whilst
Edward
sat
absolutely
silent
.
And
,
*NL*
indeed
,
in
speaking
of
it
afterwards
,
she
has
said
several
times
:
``
I
*NL*
said
a
great
deal
more
to
him
than
I
wanted
to
,
just
because
he
was
so
*NL*
silent
.
''
She
talked
,
in
fact
,
in
the
endeavour
to
sting
him
into
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
must
have
said
so
much
that
,
with
the
expression
of
her
grievance
,
*NL*
her
mood
changed
.
She
went
back
to
her
own
room
in
the
gallery
,
and
sat
*NL*
there
for
a
long
time
thinking
.
And
she
thought
herself
into
a
mood
*NL*
of
absolute
unselfishness
,
of
absolute
self-contempt
,
too
.
She
said
to
*NL*
herself
that
she
was
no
good
;
that
she
had
failed
in
all
her
efforts
--
in
*NL*
her
efforts
to
get
Edward
back
as
in
her
efforts
to
make
him
curb
his
*NL*
expenditure
.
She
imagined
herself
to
be
exhausted
;
she
imagined
herself
*NL*
to
be
done
.
Then
a
great
fear
came
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
that
Edward
,
after
what
she
had
said
to
him
,
must
have
*NL*
committed
suicide
.
She
went
out
on
to
the
gallery
and
listened
;
there
*NL*
was
no
sound
in
all
the
house
except
the
regular
beat
of
the
great
clock
*NL*
in
the
hall
.
But
,
even
in
her
debased
condition
,
she
was
not
the
person
*NL*
to
hang
about
.
She
acted
.
She
went
straight
to
Edward
's
room
,
opened
the
*NL*
door
,
and
looked
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
oiling
the
breech
action
of
a
gun
.
It
was
an
unusual
thing
for
*NL*
him
to
do
,
at
that
time
of
night
,
in
his
evening
clothes
.
It
never
*NL*
occurred
to
her
,
nevertheless
,
that
he
was
going
to
shoot
himself
with
*NL*
that
implement
.
She
knew
that
he
was
doing
it
just
for
occupation
--
to
*NL*
keep
himself
from
thinking
.
He
looked
up
when
she
opened
the
door
,
his
*NL*
face
illuminated
by
the
light
cast
upwards
from
the
round
orifices
in
*NL*
the
green
candle
shades
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
imagine
that
I
should
find
Nancy
here
.
''
She
thought
that
she
*NL*
owed
that
to
him
.
He
answered
then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
imagine
that
you
did
imagine
it
.
''
Those
were
the
only
words
*NL*
he
spoke
that
night
.
She
went
,
like
a
lame
duck
,
back
through
the
long
*NL*
corridors
;
she
stumbled
over
the
familiar
tiger
skins
in
the
dark
hall
.
*NL*
She
could
hardly
drag
one
limb
after
the
other
.
In
the
gallery
she
*NL*
perceived
that
Nancy
's
door
was
half
open
and
that
there
was
a
light
in
*NL*
the
girl
's
room
.
A
sudden
madness
possessed
her
,
a
desire
for
action
,
a
*NL*
thirst
for
self-explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
rooms
all
gave
on
to
the
gallery
;
Leonora
's
to
the
east
,
the
*NL*
girl
's
next
,
then
Edward
's
.
The
sight
of
those
three
open
doors
,
side
by
*NL*
side
,
gaping
to
receive
whom
the
chances
of
the
black
night
might
bring
,
*NL*
made
Leonora
shudder
all
over
her
body
.
She
went
into
Nancy
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
was
sitting
perfectly
still
in
an
armchair
,
very
upright
,
as
*NL*
she
had
been
taught
to
sit
at
the
convent
.
She
appeared
to
be
as
calm
*NL*
as
a
church
;
her
hair
fell
,
black
and
like
a
pall
,
down
over
both
her
*NL*
shoulders
.
The
fire
beside
her
was
burning
brightly
;
she
must
have
just
*NL*
put
coals
on
.
She
was
in
a
white
silk
kimono
that
covered
her
to
the
*NL*
feet
.
The
clothes
that
she
had
taken
off
were
exactly
folded
upon
the
*NL*
proper
seats
.
Her
long
hands
were
one
upon
each
arm
of
the
chair
that
*NL*
had
a
pink
and
white
chintz
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
told
me
these
things
.
She
seemed
to
think
it
extraordinary
that
*NL*
the
girl
could
have
done
such
orderly
things
as
fold
up
the
clothes
she
*NL*
had
taken
off
upon
such
a
night
--
when
Edward
had
announced
that
he
was
*NL*
going
to
send
her
to
her
father
,
and
when
,
from
her
mother
,
she
had
*NL*
received
that
letter
.
The
letter
,
in
its
envelope
,
was
in
her
right
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
did
not
at
first
perceive
it
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
so
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
answered
:
``
Just
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
seemed
to
think
in
whispers
and
to
speak
below
their
breaths
.
Then
*NL*
Leonora
's
eyes
fell
on
the
envelope
,
and
she
recognized
Mrs
Rufford
's
*NL*
handwriting
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
those
moments
when
thinking
was
impossible
,
Leonora
said
.
*NL*
It
was
as
if
stones
were
being
thrown
at
her
from
every
direction
and
*NL*
she
could
only
run
.
She
heard
herself
exclaim
:
``
Edward
's
dying
--
because
*NL*
of
you
.
He
's
dying
.
He
's
worth
more
than
either
of
us
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
looked
past
her
at
the
panels
of
the
half-closed
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
father
,
''
she
said
,
``
my
poor
father
.
''
``
You
must
stay
here
,
''
*NL*
Leonora
answered
fiercely
.
``
You
must
stay
here
.
I
tell
you
you
must
stay
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
Glasgow
,
''
Nancy
answered
.
``
I
shall
go
to
Glasgow
tomorrow
*NL*
morning
.
My
mother
is
in
Glasgow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
appears
that
it
was
in
Glasgow
that
Mrs
Rufford
pursued
her
*NL*
disorderly
life
.
She
had
selected
that
city
,
not
because
it
was
more
*NL*
profitable
but
because
it
was
the
natal
home
of
her
husband
to
whom
she
*NL*
desired
to
cause
as
much
pain
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
stay
here
,
''
Leonora
began
,
``
to
save
Edward
.
He
's
dying
for
*NL*
love
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
turned
her
calm
eyes
upon
Leonora
.
``
I
know
it
,
''
she
said
.
``
And
*NL*
I
am
dying
for
love
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
uttered
an
``
Ah
,
''
that
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
was
an
``
Ah
''
of
*NL*
horror
and
of
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
why
,
''
the
girl
continued
,
``
I
am
going
to
Glasgow
--
to
take
my
*NL*
mother
away
from
there
.
''
She
added
,
``
To
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
''
for
,
if
*NL*
the
last
months
had
made
her
nature
that
of
a
woman
,
her
phrases
were
*NL*
still
romantically
those
of
a
schoolgirl
.
It
was
as
if
she
had
grown
*NL*
up
so
quickly
that
there
had
not
been
time
to
put
her
hair
up
.
But
she
*NL*
added
:
``
We
're
no
good
--
my
mother
and
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
said
,
with
her
fierce
calmness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
No
.
You
're
not
no
good
.
It
's
I
that
am
no
good
.
You
ca
n't
let
that
*NL*
man
go
on
to
ruin
for
want
of
you
.
You
must
belong
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
,
she
said
,
smiled
at
her
with
a
queer
,
far-away
smile
--
as
if
*NL*
she
were
a
thousand
years
old
,
as
if
Leonora
were
a
tiny
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
would
come
to
that
,
''
she
said
,
very
slowly
.
``
But
we
are
not
*NL*
worth
it
--
Edward
and
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
NANCY
had
,
in
fact
,
been
thinking
ever
since
Leonora
had
made
that
*NL*
comment
over
the
giving
of
the
horse
to
young
Selmes
.
She
had
been
*NL*
thinking
and
thinking
,
because
she
had
had
to
sit
for
many
days
silent
*NL*
beside
her
aunt
's
bed
.
-LRB-
She
had
always
thought
of
Leonora
as
her
aunt
.
-RRB-
*NL*
And
she
had
had
to
sit
thinking
during
many
silent
meals
with
Edward
.
*NL*
And
then
,
at
times
,
with
his
bloodshot
eyes
and
creased
,
heavy
mouth
,
*NL*
he
would
smile
at
her
.
And
gradually
the
knowledge
had
come
to
her
*NL*
that
Edward
did
not
love
Leonora
and
that
Leonora
hated
Edward
.
Several
*NL*
things
contributed
to
form
and
to
harden
this
conviction
.
She
was
*NL*
allowed
to
read
the
papers
in
those
days
--
or
,
rather
,
since
Leonora
was
*NL*
always
on
her
bed
and
Edward
breakfasted
alone
and
went
out
early
,
over
*NL*
the
estate
,
she
was
left
alone
with
the
papers
.
One
day
,
in
the
papers
,
*NL*
she
saw
the
portrait
of
a
woman
she
knew
very
well
.
Beneath
it
she
read
*NL*
the
words
:
``
The
Hon.
Mrs
Brand
,
plaintiff
in
the
remarkable
divorce
case
*NL*
reported
on
p.
8
.
''
Nancy
hardly
knew
what
a
divorce
case
was
.
She
had
*NL*
been
so
remarkably
well
brought
up
,
and
Roman
Catholics
do
not
practise
*NL*
divorce
.
I
do
n't
know
how
Leonora
had
done
it
exactly
.
I
suppose
she
had
*NL*
always
impressed
it
on
Nancy
's
mind
that
nice
women
did
not
read
these
*NL*
things
,
and
that
would
have
been
enough
to
make
Nancy
skip
those
pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
read
,
at
any
rate
,
the
account
of
the
Brand
divorce
*NL*
case
--
principally
because
she
wanted
to
tell
Leonora
about
it
.
She
*NL*
imagined
that
Leonora
,
when
her
headache
left
her
,
would
like
to
know
*NL*
what
was
happening
to
Mrs
Brand
,
who
lived
at
Christchurch
,
and
whom
*NL*
they
both
liked
very
well
.
The
case
occupied
three
days
,
and
the
report
*NL*
that
Nancy
first
came
upon
was
that
of
the
third
day
.
Edward
,
however
,
*NL*
kept
the
papers
of
the
week
,
after
his
methodical
fashion
,
in
a
rack
in
*NL*
his
gun-room
,
and
when
she
had
finished
her
breakfast
Nancy
went
to
*NL*
that
quiet
apartment
and
had
what
she
would
have
called
a
good
read
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
queer
affair
.
She
could
not
understand
why
one
*NL*
counsel
should
be
so
anxious
to
know
all
about
the
movements
of
Mr
Brand
*NL*
upon
a
certain
day
;
she
could
not
understand
why
a
chart
of
the
bedroom
*NL*
accommodation
at
Christchurch
Old
Hall
should
be
produced
in
court
.
*NL*
She
did
not
even
see
why
they
should
want
to
know
that
,
upon
a
certain
*NL*
occasion
,
the
drawing-room
door
was
locked
.
It
made
her
laugh
;
it
*NL*
appeared
to
be
all
so
senseless
that
grown
people
should
occupy
*NL*
themselves
with
such
matters
.
It
struck
her
,
nevertheless
,
as
odd
that
*NL*
one
of
the
counsel
should
cross-question
Mr
Brand
so
insistently
and
so
*NL*
impertinently
as
to
his
feelings
for
Miss
Lupton
.
Nancy
knew
Miss
Lupton
*NL*
of
Ringwood
very
well
--
a
jolly
girl
,
who
rode
a
horse
with
two
white
*NL*
fetlocks
.
Mr
Brand
persisted
that
he
did
not
love
Miss
Lupton
...
Well
,
*NL*
of
course
he
did
not
love
Miss
Lupton
;
he
was
a
married
man
.
You
might
*NL*
as
well
think
of
Uncle
Edward
loving
...
loving
anybody
but
Leonora
.
When
*NL*
people
were
married
there
was
an
end
of
loving
.
There
were
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
people
who
misbehaved
--
but
they
were
poor
people
--
or
people
not
like
*NL*
those
she
knew
.
So
these
matters
presented
themselves
to
Nancy
's
mind
.
*NL*
But
later
on
in
the
case
she
found
that
Mr
Brand
had
to
confess
to
a
*NL*
``
guilty
intimacy
''
with
some
one
or
other
.
Nancy
imagined
that
he
must
*NL*
have
been
telling
some
one
his
wife
's
secrets
;
she
could
not
*NL*
understand
why
that
was
a
serious
offence
.
Of
course
it
was
not
very
*NL*
gentlemanly
--
it
lessened
her
opinion
of
Mrs
Brand
.
But
since
she
found
*NL*
that
Mrs
Brand
had
condoned
that
offence
,
she
imagined
that
they
could
*NL*
not
have
been
very
serious
secrets
that
Mr
Brand
had
told
.
And
then
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
it
was
forced
on
her
conviction
that
Mr
Brand
--
the
mild
*NL*
Mr
Brand
that
she
had
seen
a
month
or
two
before
their
departure
to
*NL*
Nauheim
,
playing
``
Blind
Man
's
Buff
''
with
his
children
and
kissing
his
*NL*
wife
when
he
caught
her
--
Mr
Brand
and
Mrs
Brand
had
been
on
the
worst
*NL*
possible
terms
.
That
was
incredible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
there
it
was
--
in
black
and
white
.
Mr
Brand
drank
;
Mr
Brand
had
*NL*
struck
Mrs
Brand
to
the
ground
when
he
was
drunk
.
Mr
Brand
was
adjudged
,
*NL*
in
two
or
three
abrupt
words
,
at
the
end
of
columns
and
columns
of
*NL*
paper
,
to
have
been
guilty
of
cruelty
to
his
wife
and
to
have
*NL*
committed
adultery
with
Miss
Lupton
.
The
last
words
conveyed
nothing
to
*NL*
Nancy
--
nothing
real
,
that
is
to
say
.
She
knew
that
one
was
commanded
not
*NL*
to
commit
adultery
--
but
why
,
she
thought
,
should
one
?
It
was
probably
*NL*
something
like
catching
salmon
out
of
season
--
a
thing
one
did
not
do
.
*NL*
She
gathered
it
had
something
to
do
with
kissing
,
or
holding
some
one
in
*NL*
your
arms
.
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
the
whole
effect
of
that
reading
upon
Nancy
was
mysterious
,
*NL*
terrifying
and
evil
.
She
felt
a
sickness
--
a
sickness
that
grew
as
she
*NL*
read
.
Her
heart
beat
painfully
;
she
began
to
cry
.
She
asked
God
how
He
*NL*
could
permit
such
things
to
be
.
And
she
was
more
certain
that
Edward
did
*NL*
not
love
Leonora
and
that
Leonora
hated
Edward
.
Perhaps
,
then
,
Edward
*NL*
loved
some
one
else
.
It
was
unthinkable
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
could
love
some
one
else
than
Leonora
,
her
fierce
unknown
heart
*NL*
suddenly
spoke
in
her
side
,
why
could
it
not
be
herself
?
And
he
did
not
*NL*
love
her
...
This
had
occurred
about
a
month
before
she
got
the
letter
*NL*
from
her
mother
.
She
let
the
matter
rest
until
the
sick
feeling
went
*NL*
off
;
it
did
that
in
a
day
or
two
.
Then
,
finding
that
Leonora
's
headaches
*NL*
had
gone
,
she
suddenly
told
Leonora
that
Mrs
Brand
had
divorced
her
*NL*
husband
.
She
asked
what
,
exactly
,
it
all
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
the
hall
;
she
was
feeling
so
weak
that
*NL*
she
could
hardly
find
the
words
.
She
answered
just
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
that
Mr
Brand
will
be
able
to
marry
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
...
but
...
''
and
then
:
``
He
will
be
able
to
marry
Miss
Lupton
.
''
*NL*
Leonora
just
moved
a
hand
in
assent
.
Her
eyes
were
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
...
''
Nancy
began
.
Her
blue
eyes
were
full
of
horror
:
her
brows
were
*NL*
tight
above
them
;
the
lines
of
pain
about
her
mouth
were
very
distinct
.
*NL*
In
her
eyes
the
whole
of
that
familiar
,
great
hall
had
a
changed
aspect
.
*NL*
The
andirons
with
the
brass
flowers
at
the
ends
appeared
unreal
;
the
*NL*
burning
logs
were
just
logs
that
were
burning
and
not
the
comfortable
*NL*
symbols
of
an
indestructible
mode
of
life
.
The
flame
fluttered
before
*NL*
the
high
fireback
;
the
St
Bernard
sighed
in
his
sleep
.
Outside
the
*NL*
winter
rain
fell
and
fell
.
And
suddenly
she
thought
that
Edward
might
*NL*
marry
some
one
else
;
and
she
nearly
screamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
opened
her
eyes
,
lying
sideways
,
with
her
face
upon
the
black
*NL*
and
gold
pillow
of
the
sofa
that
was
drawn
half
across
the
great
*NL*
fireplace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
''
Nancy
said
,
``
I
never
imagined
...
Are
n't
marriages
*NL*
sacraments
?
Are
n't
they
indissoluble
?
I
thought
you
were
married
.
.
.
*NL*
and
...
''
She
was
sobbing
.
``
I
thought
you
were
married
or
not
married
as
*NL*
you
are
alive
or
dead
.
''
``
That
,
''
Leonora
said
,
``
is
the
law
of
the
church
.
*NL*
It
is
not
the
law
of
the
land
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
Nancy
said
,
``
the
Brands
are
Protestants
.
''
She
felt
a
sudden
*NL*
safeness
descend
upon
her
,
and
for
an
hour
or
so
her
mind
was
at
rest
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
her
idiotic
not
to
have
remembered
Henry
VIII
and
the
basis
*NL*
upon
which
Protestantism
rests
.
She
almost
laughed
at
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
long
afternoon
wore
on
;
the
flames
still
fluttered
when
the
maid
*NL*
made
up
the
fire
;
the
St
Bernard
awoke
and
lolloped
away
towards
the
*NL*
kitchen
.
And
then
Leonora
opened
her
eyes
and
said
almost
coldly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
Do
n't
you
think
you
will
get
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
unlike
Leonora
that
,
for
the
moment
,
the
girl
was
frightened
*NL*
in
the
dusk
.
But
then
,
again
,
it
seemed
a
perfectly
reasonable
question
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
do
n't
know
that
anyone
wants
to
marry
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Several
people
want
to
marry
you
,
''
Leonora
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
want
to
marry
,
''
Nancy
answered
.
``
I
should
like
to
go
on
*NL*
living
with
you
and
Edward
.
I
do
n't
think
I
am
in
the
way
or
that
I
am
*NL*
really
an
expense
.
If
I
went
you
would
have
to
have
a
companion
.
Or
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
I
ought
to
earn
my
living
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
n't
thinking
of
that
,
''
Leonora
answered
in
the
same
dull
tone
.
*NL*
``
You
will
have
money
enough
from
your
father
.
But
most
people
want
to
be
*NL*
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
that
she
then
asked
the
girl
if
she
would
not
like
to
marry
*NL*
me
,
and
that
Nancy
answered
that
she
would
marry
me
if
she
were
told
to
;
*NL*
but
that
she
wanted
to
go
on
living
there
.
She
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
married
anyone
I
should
want
him
to
be
like
Edward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
frightened
out
of
her
life
.
Leonora
writhed
on
her
couch
and
*NL*
called
out
:
``
Oh
,
God
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
ran
for
the
maid
;
for
tablets
of
aspirin
;
for
wet
handkerchiefs
.
*NL*
It
never
occurred
to
her
that
Leonora
's
expression
of
agony
was
for
*NL*
anything
else
than
physical
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
to
remember
that
all
this
happened
a
month
before
Leonora
went
*NL*
into
the
girl
's
room
at
night
.
I
have
been
casting
back
again
;
but
I
*NL*
can
not
help
it
.
It
is
so
difficult
to
keep
all
these
people
going
.
I
*NL*
tell
you
about
Leonora
and
bring
her
up
to
date
;
then
about
Edward
,
who
*NL*
has
fallen
behind
.
And
then
the
girl
gets
hopelessly
left
behind
.
I
wish
*NL*
I
could
put
it
down
in
diary
form
.
Thus
:
On
the
1st
of
September
they
*NL*
returned
from
Nauheim
.
Leonora
at
once
took
to
her
bed
.
By
the
1st
*NL*
of
October
they
were
all
going
to
meets
together
.
Nancy
had
already
*NL*
observed
very
fully
that
Edward
was
strange
in
his
manner
.
About
the
6th
*NL*
of
that
month
Edward
gave
the
horse
to
young
Selmes
,
and
Nancy
had
cause
*NL*
to
believe
that
her
aunt
did
not
love
her
uncle
.
On
the
20th
she
read
*NL*
the
account
of
the
divorce
case
,
which
is
reported
in
the
papers
of
the
*NL*
18th
and
the
two
following
days
.
On
the
23rd
she
had
the
conversation
*NL*
with
her
aunt
in
the
hall
--
about
marriage
in
general
and
about
her
own
*NL*
possible
marriage
,
her
aunt
's
coming
to
her
bedroom
did
not
occur
until
*NL*
the
12th
of
November
...
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
she
had
three
weeks
for
introspection
--
for
introspection
beneath
*NL*
gloomy
skies
,
in
that
old
house
,
rendered
darker
by
the
fact
that
it
lay
*NL*
in
a
hollow
crowned
by
fir
trees
with
their
black
shadows
.
It
was
not
*NL*
a
good
situation
for
a
girl
.
She
began
thinking
about
love
,
she
who
had
*NL*
never
before
considered
it
as
anything
other
than
a
rather
humorous
,
*NL*
rather
nonsensical
matter
.
She
remembered
chance
passages
in
chance
*NL*
books
--
things
that
had
not
really
affected
her
at
all
at
the
time
.
She
*NL*
remembered
someone
's
love
for
the
Princess
Badrulbadour
;
she
remembered
*NL*
to
have
heard
that
love
was
a
flame
,
a
thirst
,
a
withering
up
of
the
*NL*
vitals
--
though
she
did
not
know
what
the
vitals
were
.
She
had
a
vague
*NL*
recollection
that
love
was
said
to
render
a
hopeless
lover
's
eyes
*NL*
hopeless
;
she
remembered
a
character
in
a
book
who
was
said
to
have
*NL*
taken
to
drink
through
love
;
she
remembered
that
lovers
'
existences
*NL*
were
said
to
be
punctuated
with
heavy
sighs
.
Once
she
went
to
the
little
*NL*
cottage
piano
that
was
in
the
corner
of
the
hall
and
began
to
play
.
It
*NL*
was
a
tinkly
,
reedy
instrument
,
for
none
of
that
household
had
any
turn
*NL*
for
music
.
Nancy
herself
could
play
a
few
simple
songs
,
and
she
found
*NL*
herself
playing
.
She
had
been
sitting
on
the
window
seat
,
looking
out
on
*NL*
the
fading
day
.
Leonora
had
gone
to
pay
some
calls
;
Edward
was
looking
*NL*
after
some
planting
up
in
the
new
spinney
.
Thus
she
found
herself
*NL*
playing
on
the
old
piano
.
She
did
not
know
how
she
came
to
be
doing
it
.
*NL*
A
silly
lilting
wavering
tune
came
from
before
her
in
the
dusk
--
a
tune
*NL*
in
which
major
notes
with
their
cheerful
insistence
wavered
and
melted
*NL*
into
minor
sounds
,
as
,
beneath
a
bridge
,
the
high
lights
on
dark
waters
*NL*
melt
and
waver
and
disappear
into
black
depths
.
Well
,
it
was
a
silly
old
*NL*
tune
...
*NL*
*NL*
It
goes
with
the
words
--
they
are
about
a
willow
tree
,
I
think
:
Thou
art
*NL*
to
all
lost
loves
the
best
The
only
true
plant
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
sort
of
thing
.
It
is
Herrick
,
I
believe
,
and
the
music
with
the
*NL*
reedy
,
irregular
,
lilting
sound
that
goes
with
Herrick
,
And
it
was
*NL*
dusk
;
the
heavy
,
hewn
,
dark
pillars
that
supported
the
gallery
were
like
*NL*
mourning
presences
;
the
fire
had
sunk
to
nothing
--
a
mere
glow
amongst
*NL*
white
ashes
...
It
was
a
sentimental
sort
of
place
and
light
and
*NL*
hour
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
Nancy
found
that
she
was
crying
.
She
was
crying
quietly
;
*NL*
she
went
on
to
cry
with
long
convulsive
sobs
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
everything
gay
,
everything
charming
,
all
light
,
all
sweetness
,
had
gone
*NL*
out
of
life
.
Unhappiness
;
unhappiness
;
unhappiness
was
all
around
her
.
*NL*
She
seemed
to
know
no
happy
being
and
she
herself
was
agonizing
...
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
that
Edward
's
eyes
were
hopeless
;
she
was
certain
that
he
*NL*
was
drinking
too
much
;
at
times
he
sighed
deeply
.
He
appeared
as
a
man
*NL*
who
was
burning
with
inward
flame
;
drying
up
in
the
soul
with
thirst
;
*NL*
withering
up
in
the
vitals
.
Then
,
the
torturing
conviction
came
to
*NL*
her
--
the
conviction
that
had
visited
her
again
and
again
--
that
Edward
*NL*
must
love
some
one
other
than
Leonora
.
With
her
little
,
pedagogic
*NL*
sectarianism
she
remembered
that
Catholics
do
not
do
this
thing
.
But
*NL*
Edward
was
a
Protestant
.
Then
Edward
loved
somebody
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
after
that
thought
,
her
eyes
grew
hopeless
;
she
sighed
as
the
old
*NL*
St
Bernard
beside
her
did
.
At
meals
she
would
feel
an
intolerable
desire
*NL*
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
then
another
and
then
a
third
.
Then
she
*NL*
would
find
herself
grow
gay
...
But
in
half
an
hour
the
gaiety
went
;
she
*NL*
felt
like
a
person
who
is
burning
up
with
an
inward
flame
;
desiccating
*NL*
at
the
soul
with
thirst
;
withering
up
in
the
vitals
.
One
evening
she
*NL*
went
into
Edward
's
gun-room
--
he
had
gone
to
a
meeting
of
the
National
*NL*
Reserve
Committee
.
On
the
table
beside
his
chair
was
a
decanter
of
*NL*
whisky
.
She
poured
out
a
wineglassful
and
drank
it
off
.
Flame
then
*NL*
really
seemed
to
fill
her
body
;
her
legs
swelled
;
her
face
grew
*NL*
feverish
.
She
dragged
her
tall
height
up
to
her
room
and
lay
in
the
*NL*
dark
.
The
bed
reeled
beneath
her
;
she
gave
way
to
the
thought
that
she
*NL*
was
in
Edward
's
arms
;
that
he
was
kissing
her
on
her
face
that
burned
;
*NL*
on
her
shoulders
that
burned
,
and
on
her
neck
that
was
on
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
touched
alcohol
again
.
Not
once
after
that
did
she
have
such
*NL*
thoughts
.
They
died
out
of
her
mind
;
they
left
only
a
feeling
of
shame
*NL*
so
insupportable
that
her
brain
could
not
take
it
in
and
they
vanished
.
*NL*
She
imagined
that
her
anguish
at
the
thought
of
Edward
's
love
for
*NL*
another
person
was
solely
sympathy
for
Leonora
;
she
determined
that
*NL*
the
rest
of
her
life
must
be
spent
in
acting
as
Leonora
's
*NL*
handmaiden
--
sweeping
,
tending
,
embroidering
,
like
some
Deborah
,
some
*NL*
medieval
saint
--
I
am
not
,
unfortunately
,
up
in
the
Catholic
hagiology
.
*NL*
But
I
know
that
she
pictured
herself
as
some
personage
with
a
depressed
,
*NL*
earnest
face
and
tightly
closed
lips
,
in
a
clear
white
room
,
watering
*NL*
flowers
or
tending
an
embroidery
frame
.
Or
,
she
desired
to
go
with
*NL*
Edward
to
Africa
and
to
throw
herself
in
the
path
of
a
charging
lion
so
*NL*
that
Edward
might
be
saved
for
Leonora
at
the
cost
of
her
life
.
*NL*
Well
,
along
with
her
sad
thoughts
she
had
her
childish
ones
.
She
knew
*NL*
nothing
--
nothing
of
life
,
except
that
one
must
live
sadly
.
That
she
now
*NL*
knew
.
What
happened
to
her
on
the
night
when
she
received
at
once
the
*NL*
blow
that
Edward
wished
her
to
go
to
her
father
in
India
and
the
blow
*NL*
of
the
letter
from
her
mother
was
this
.
She
called
first
upon
her
sweet
*NL*
Saviour
--
and
she
thought
of
Our
Lord
as
her
sweet
Saviour
!
--
that
He
*NL*
might
make
it
impossible
that
she
should
go
to
India
.
Then
she
realized
*NL*
from
Edward
's
demeanour
that
he
was
determined
that
she
should
go
to
*NL*
India
.
It
must
then
be
right
that
she
should
go
.
Edward
was
always
right
*NL*
in
his
determinations
.
He
was
the
Cid
;
he
was
Lohengrin
;
he
was
the
*NL*
Chevalier
Bayard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
her
mind
mutinied
and
revolted
.
She
could
not
leave
that
*NL*
house
.
She
imagined
that
he
wished
her
gone
that
she
might
not
witness
*NL*
his
amours
with
another
girl
.
Well
,
she
was
prepared
to
tell
him
that
*NL*
she
was
ready
to
witness
his
amours
with
another
young
girl
.
She
would
*NL*
stay
there
--
to
comfort
Leonora
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
desperate
shock
of
the
letter
from
her
mother
.
Her
mother
*NL*
said
,
I
believe
,
something
like
:
``
You
have
no
right
to
go
on
living
your
*NL*
life
of
prosperity
and
respect
.
You
ought
to
be
on
the
streets
with
me
.
*NL*
How
do
you
know
that
you
are
even
Colonel
Rufford
's
daughter
?
''
She
did
*NL*
not
know
what
these
words
meant
.
She
thought
of
her
mother
as
sleeping
*NL*
beneath
the
arches
whilst
the
snow
fell
.
That
was
the
impression
*NL*
conveyed
to
her
mind
by
the
words
``
on
the
streets
''
.
A
Platonic
sense
of
*NL*
duty
gave
her
the
idea
that
she
ought
to
go
to
comfort
her
mother
--
the
*NL*
mother
that
bore
her
,
though
she
hardly
knew
what
the
words
meant
.
At
*NL*
the
same
time
she
knew
that
her
mother
had
left
her
father
with
another
*NL*
man
--
therefore
she
pitied
her
father
,
and
thought
it
terrible
in
herself
*NL*
that
she
trembled
at
the
sound
of
her
father
's
voice
.
If
her
mother
*NL*
was
that
sort
of
woman
it
was
natural
that
her
father
should
have
had
*NL*
accesses
of
madness
in
which
he
had
struck
herself
to
the
ground
.
And
*NL*
the
voice
of
her
conscience
said
to
her
that
her
first
duty
was
to
her
*NL*
parents
.
It
was
in
accord
with
this
awakened
sense
of
duty
that
she
*NL*
undressed
with
great
care
and
meticulously
folded
the
clothes
that
she
*NL*
took
off
.
Sometimes
,
but
not
very
often
,
she
threw
them
helter-skelter
*NL*
about
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
sense
of
duty
was
her
prevailing
mood
when
Leonora
,
tall
,
*NL*
clean-run
,
golden-haired
,
all
in
black
,
appeared
in
her
doorway
,
and
*NL*
told
her
that
Edward
was
dying
of
love
for
her
.
She
knew
then
with
her
*NL*
conscious
mind
what
she
had
known
within
herself
for
months
--
that
Edward
*NL*
was
dying
--
actually
and
physically
dying
--
of
love
for
her
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
her
that
for
one
short
moment
her
spirit
could
say
:
``
Domine
,
nunc
*NL*
dimittis
,
...
Lord
,
now
,
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
.
''
She
*NL*
imagined
that
she
could
cheerfully
go
away
to
Glasgow
and
rescue
her
*NL*
fallen
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
AND
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
in
tune
with
the
mood
,
with
the
hour
,
and
*NL*
with
the
woman
in
front
of
her
to
say
that
she
knew
Edward
was
dying
of
*NL*
love
for
her
and
that
she
was
dying
of
love
for
Edward
.
For
that
fact
*NL*
had
suddenly
slipped
into
place
and
become
real
for
her
as
the
niched
*NL*
marker
on
a
whist
tablet
slips
round
with
the
pressure
of
your
thumb
.
*NL*
That
rubber
at
least
was
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
Leonora
seemed
to
have
become
different
and
she
seemed
to
*NL*
have
become
different
in
her
attitude
towards
Leonora
.
It
was
as
if
*NL*
she
,
in
her
frail
,
white
,
silken
kimono
,
sat
beside
her
fire
,
but
upon
a
*NL*
throne
.
It
was
as
if
Leonora
,
in
her
close
dress
of
black
lace
,
with
the
*NL*
gleaming
white
shoulders
and
the
coiled
yellow
hair
that
the
girl
had
*NL*
always
considered
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
--
it
was
as
*NL*
if
Leonora
had
become
pinched
,
shrivelled
,
blue
with
cold
,
shivering
,
*NL*
suppliant
.
Yet
Leonora
was
commanding
her
.
It
was
no
good
commanding
*NL*
her
.
She
was
going
on
the
morrow
to
her
mother
who
was
in
Glasgow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
went
on
saying
that
she
must
stay
there
to
save
Edward
,
who
was
*NL*
dying
of
love
for
her
.
And
,
proud
and
happy
in
the
thought
that
Edward
*NL*
loved
her
,
and
that
she
loved
him
,
she
did
not
even
listen
to
what
*NL*
Leonora
said
.
It
appeared
to
her
that
it
was
Leonora
's
business
to
save
*NL*
her
husband
's
body
;
she
,
Nancy
,
possessed
his
soul
--
a
precious
thing
*NL*
that
she
would
shield
and
bear
away
up
in
her
arms
--
as
if
Leonora
were
*NL*
a
hungry
dog
,
trying
to
spring
up
at
a
lamb
that
she
was
carrying
.
Yes
,
*NL*
she
felt
as
if
Edward
's
love
were
a
precious
lamb
that
she
were
bearing
*NL*
away
from
a
cruel
and
predatory
beast
.
For
,
at
that
time
,
Leonora
*NL*
appeared
to
her
as
a
cruel
and
predatory
beast
.
Leonora
,
Leonora
with
*NL*
her
hunger
,
with
her
cruelty
had
driven
Edward
to
madness
.
He
must
be
*NL*
sheltered
by
his
love
for
her
and
by
her
love
--
her
love
from
a
great
*NL*
distance
and
unspoken
,
enveloping
him
,
surrounding
him
,
upholding
him
;
*NL*
by
her
voice
speaking
from
Glasgow
,
saying
that
she
loved
,
that
she
*NL*
adored
,
that
she
passed
no
moment
without
longing
,
loving
,
quivering
at
*NL*
the
thought
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
said
loudly
,
insistently
,
with
a
bitterly
imperative
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
stay
here
;
you
must
belong
to
Edward
.
I
will
divorce
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Church
does
not
allow
of
divorce
.
I
can
not
belong
to
your
husband
.
*NL*
I
am
going
to
Glasgow
to
rescue
my
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
half-opened
door
opened
noiselessly
to
the
full
.
Edward
was
there
.
*NL*
His
devouring
,
doomed
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
girl
's
face
;
his
shoulders
*NL*
slouched
forward
;
he
was
undoubtedly
half
drunk
and
he
had
the
whisky
*NL*
decanter
in
one
hand
,
a
slanting
candlestick
in
the
other
.
He
said
,
with
*NL*
a
heavy
ferocity
,
to
Nancy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forbid
you
to
talk
about
these
things
.
You
are
to
stay
here
until
I
*NL*
hear
from
your
father
.
Then
you
will
go
to
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
women
,
looking
at
each
other
,
like
beasts
about
to
spring
,
*NL*
hardly
gave
a
glance
to
him
.
He
leaned
against
the
door-post
.
He
said
*NL*
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nancy
,
I
forbid
you
to
talk
about
these
things
.
I
am
the
master
of
this
*NL*
house
.
''
And
,
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
heavy
,
male
,
coming
from
a
deep
*NL*
chest
,
in
the
night
with
the
blackness
behind
him
,
Nancy
felt
as
if
her
*NL*
spirit
bowed
before
him
,
with
folded
hands
.
She
felt
that
she
would
go
*NL*
to
India
,
and
that
she
desired
never
again
to
talk
of
these
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonora
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
that
it
is
your
duty
to
belong
to
him
.
He
must
not
be
allowed
*NL*
to
go
on
drinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nancy
did
not
answer
.
Edward
was
gone
;
they
heard
him
slipping
and
*NL*
shambling
on
the
polished
oak
of
the
stairs
.
Nancy
screamed
when
there
*NL*
came
the
sound
of
a
heavy
fall
.
Leonora
said
again
:
``
You
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sounds
went
on
from
the
hall
below
;
the
light
of
the
candle
Edward
*NL*
held
flickered
up
between
the
hand
rails
of
the
gallery
.
Then
they
heard
*NL*
his
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
Glasgow
...
Glasgow
,
in
Scotland
.
.
I
want
the
number
of
a
man
*NL*
called
White
,
of
Simrock
Park
,
Glasgow
...
Edward
White
,
Simrock
Park
,
*NL*
Glasgow
...
ten
minutes
...
at
this
time
of
night
...
''
His
voice
was
*NL*
quite
level
,
normal
,
and
patient
.
Alcohol
took
him
in
the
legs
,
not
the
*NL*
speech
.
``
I
can
wait
,
''
his
voice
came
again
.
``
Yes
,
I
know
they
have
a
*NL*
number
.
I
have
been
in
communication
with
them
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
going
to
telephone
to
your
mother
,
''
Leonora
said
.
``
He
will
make
*NL*
it
all
right
for
her
.
''
She
got
up
and
closed
the
door
.
She
came
back
*NL*
to
the
fire
,
and
added
bitterly
:
``
He
can
always
make
it
all
right
for
*NL*
everybody
,
except
me
--
excepting
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
said
nothing
.
She
sat
there
in
a
blissful
dream
.
She
seemed
to
*NL*
see
her
lover
sitting
as
he
always
sat
,
in
a
round-backed
chair
,
in
*NL*
the
dark
hall
--
sitting
low
,
with
the
receiver
at
his
ear
,
talking
in
a
*NL*
gentle
,
slow
voice
,
that
he
reserved
for
the
telephone
--
and
saving
*NL*
the
world
and
her
,
in
the
black
darkness
.
She
moved
her
hand
over
the
*NL*
bareness
of
the
base
of
her
throat
,
to
have
the
warmth
of
flesh
upon
it
*NL*
and
upon
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
nothing
;
Leonora
went
on
talking
...
*NL*
*NL*
God
knows
what
Leonora
said
.
She
repeated
that
the
girl
must
belong
*NL*
to
her
husband
.
She
said
that
she
used
that
phrase
because
,
though
*NL*
she
might
have
a
divorce
,
or
even
a
dissolution
of
the
marriage
by
the
*NL*
Church
,
it
would
still
be
adultery
that
the
girl
and
Edward
would
be
*NL*
committing
.
But
she
said
that
that
was
necessary
;
it
was
the
price
that
*NL*
the
girl
must
pay
for
the
sin
of
having
made
Edward
love
her
,
for
the
*NL*
sin
of
loving
her
husband
.
She
talked
on
and
on
,
beside
the
fire
.
The
*NL*
girl
must
become
an
adulteress
;
she
had
wronged
Edward
by
being
so
*NL*
beautiful
,
so
gracious
,
so
good
.
It
was
sinful
to
be
so
good
.
She
must
*NL*
pay
the
price
so
as
to
save
the
man
she
had
wronged
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
between
her
pauses
the
girl
could
hear
the
voice
of
Edward
,
droning
*NL*
on
,
indistinguishably
,
with
jerky
pauses
for
replies
.
It
made
her
glow
*NL*
with
pride
;
the
man
she
loved
was
working
for
her
.
He
at
least
was
*NL*
resolved
;
was
malely
determined
;
knew
the
right
thing
.
Leonora
talked
*NL*
on
with
her
eyes
boring
into
Nancy
's
.
The
girl
hardly
looked
at
her
and
*NL*
hardly
heard
her
.
After
a
long
time
Nancy
said
--
after
hours
and
hours
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
go
to
India
as
soon
as
Edward
hears
from
my
father
.
I
can
not
*NL*
talk
about
these
things
,
because
Edward
does
not
wish
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
Leonora
screamed
out
and
wavered
swiftly
towards
the
closed
*NL*
door
.
And
Nancy
found
that
she
was
springing
out
of
her
chair
with
*NL*
her
white
arms
stretched
wide
.
She
was
clasping
the
other
woman
to
her
*NL*
breast
;
she
was
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
poor
dear
;
oh
,
my
poor
dear
.
''
And
they
sat
,
crouching
together
*NL*
in
each
other
's
arms
,
and
crying
and
crying
;
and
they
lay
down
in
the
*NL*
same
bed
,
talking
and
talking
,
all
through
the
night
.
And
all
through
*NL*
the
night
Edward
could
hear
their
voices
through
the
wall
.
That
was
how
*NL*
it
went
...
Next
morning
they
were
all
three
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
*NL*
Towards
eleven
Edward
came
to
Nancy
,
who
was
arranging
some
Christmas
*NL*
roses
in
a
silver
bowl
.
He
put
a
telegram
beside
her
on
the
table
.
``
You
*NL*
can
uncode
it
for
yourself
,
''
he
said
.
Then
,
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
,
*NL*
he
said
:
``
You
can
tell
your
aunt
I
have
cabled
to
Mr
Dowell
to
come
*NL*
over
.
He
will
make
things
easier
till
you
leave
.
''
The
telegram
when
it
*NL*
was
uncoded
,
read
,
as
far
as
I
can
remember
:
``
Will
take
Mrs
Rufford
to
*NL*
Italy
.
Undertake
to
do
this
for
certain
.
Am
devotedly
attached
to
Mrs
*NL*
Rufford
.
Have
no
need
of
financial
assistance
.
Did
not
know
there
was
a
*NL*
daughter
,
and
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
pointing
out
my
duty
.
--
White
.
''
*NL*
It
was
something
like
that
.
Then
the
household
resumed
its
wonted
course
*NL*
of
days
until
my
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
IT
is
this
part
of
the
story
that
makes
me
saddest
of
all
.
For
I
ask
*NL*
myself
unceasingly
,
my
mind
going
round
and
round
in
a
weary
,
baffled
*NL*
space
of
pain
--
what
should
these
people
have
done
?
What
,
in
the
name
of
*NL*
God
,
should
they
have
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
end
was
perfectly
plain
to
each
of
them
--
it
was
perfectly
manifest
*NL*
at
this
stage
that
,
if
the
girl
did
not
,
in
Leonora
's
phrase
,
``
belong
to
*NL*
Edward
,
''
Edward
must
die
,
the
girl
must
lose
her
reason
because
Edward
*NL*
died
--
and
,
that
after
a
time
,
Leonora
,
who
was
the
coldest
and
the
*NL*
strongest
of
the
three
,
would
console
herself
by
marrying
Rodney
Bayham
*NL*
and
have
a
quiet
,
comfortable
,
good
time
.
That
end
,
on
that
night
,
*NL*
whilst
Leonora
sat
in
the
girl
's
bedroom
and
Edward
telephoned
down
*NL*
below
--
that
end
was
plainly
manifest
.
The
girl
,
plainly
,
was
half-mad
*NL*
already
;
Edward
was
half
dead
;
only
Leonora
,
active
,
persistent
,
*NL*
instinct
with
her
cold
passion
of
energy
,
was
``
doing
things
''
.
What
then
,
*NL*
should
they
have
done
?
worked
out
in
the
extinction
of
two
very
splendid
*NL*
personalities
--
for
Edward
and
the
girl
were
splendid
personalities
,
in
*NL*
order
that
a
third
personality
,
more
normal
,
should
have
,
after
a
long
*NL*
period
of
trouble
,
a
quiet
,
comfortable
,
good
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
writing
this
,
now
,
I
should
say
,
a
full
eighteen
months
after
*NL*
the
words
that
end
my
last
chapter
.
Since
writing
the
words
``
until
*NL*
my
arrival
''
,
which
I
see
end
that
paragraph
,
I
have
seen
again
for
a
*NL*
glimpse
,
from
a
swift
train
,
Beaucaire
with
the
beautiful
white
tower
,
*NL*
Tarascon
with
the
square
castle
,
the
great
Rhone
,
the
immense
stretches
*NL*
of
the
Crau
.
I
have
rushed
through
all
Provence
--
and
all
Provence
no
*NL*
longer
matters
.
It
is
no
longer
in
the
olive
hills
that
I
shall
find
my
*NL*
Heaven
;
because
there
is
only
Hell
...
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
is
dead
;
the
girl
is
gone
--
oh
,
utterly
gone
;
Leonora
is
having
*NL*
a
good
time
with
Rodney
Bayham
,
and
I
sit
alone
in
Branshaw
Teleragh
.
I
*NL*
have
been
through
Provence
;
I
have
seen
Africa
;
I
have
visited
Asia
to
*NL*
see
,
in
Ceylon
,
in
a
darkened
room
,
my
poor
girl
,
sitting
motionless
,
*NL*
with
her
wonderful
hair
about
her
,
looking
at
me
with
eyes
that
did
*NL*
not
see
me
,
and
saying
distinctly
:
``
Credo
in
unum
Deum
omnipotentem
...
*NL*
Credo
in
unum
Deum
omnipotentem
.
''
Those
are
the
only
reasonable
words
*NL*
she
uttered
;
those
are
the
only
words
,
it
appears
,
that
she
ever
*NL*
will
utter
.
I
suppose
that
they
are
reasonable
words
;
it
must
be
*NL*
extraordinarily
reasonable
for
her
,
if
she
can
say
that
she
believes
in
*NL*
an
Omnipotent
Deity
.
Well
,
there
it
is
.
I
am
very
tired
of
it
all
...
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
I
daresay
,
all
this
may
sound
romantic
,
but
it
is
tiring
,
tiring
,
*NL*
tiring
to
have
been
in
the
midst
of
it
;
to
have
taken
the
tickets
;
to
*NL*
have
caught
the
trains
;
to
have
chosen
the
cabins
;
to
have
consulted
*NL*
the
purser
and
the
stewards
as
to
diet
for
the
quiescent
patient
who
did
*NL*
nothing
but
announce
her
belief
in
an
Omnipotent
Deity
.
That
may
sound
*NL*
romantic
--
but
it
is
just
a
record
of
fatigue
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
always
be
selected
to
be
serviceable
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
resent
it
--
but
I
have
never
been
the
least
good
.
Florence
selected
me
*NL*
for
her
own
purposes
,
and
I
was
no
good
to
her
;
Edward
called
me
to
come
*NL*
and
have
a
chat
with
him
,
and
I
could
n't
stop
him
cutting
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
one
day
eighteen
months
ago
,
I
was
quietly
writing
in
my
*NL*
room
at
Branshaw
when
Leonora
came
to
me
with
a
letter
.
It
was
a
very
*NL*
pathetic
letter
from
Colonel
Rufford
about
Nancy
.
Colonel
Rufford
had
*NL*
left
the
army
and
had
taken
up
an
appointment
at
a
tea-planting
*NL*
estate
in
Ceylon
.
His
letter
was
pathetic
because
it
was
so
brief
,
so
*NL*
inarticulate
,
and
so
business-like
.
He
had
gone
down
to
the
boat
to
meet
*NL*
his
daughter
,
and
had
found
his
daughter
quite
mad
.
It
appears
that
at
*NL*
Aden
Nancy
had
seen
in
a
local
paper
the
news
of
Edward
's
suicide
.
In
*NL*
the
Red
Sea
she
had
gone
mad
.
She
had
remarked
to
Mrs
Colonel
Luton
,
*NL*
who
was
chaperoning
her
,
that
she
believed
in
an
Omnipotent
Deity
.
She
*NL*
had
n't
made
any
fuss
;
her
eyes
were
quite
dry
and
glassy
.
Even
when
she
*NL*
was
mad
Nancy
could
behave
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Rufford
said
the
doctor
did
not
anticipate
that
there
was
any
*NL*
chance
of
his
child
's
recovery
.
It
was
,
nevertheless
,
possible
that
if
*NL*
she
could
see
someone
from
Branshaw
it
might
soothe
her
and
it
might
*NL*
have
a
good
effect
.
And
he
just
simply
wrote
to
Leonora
:
``
Please
come
*NL*
and
see
if
you
can
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
seem
to
have
lost
all
sense
of
the
pathetic
;
but
still
,
that
simple
,
*NL*
enormous
request
of
the
old
colonel
strikes
me
as
pathetic
.
He
was
*NL*
cursed
by
his
atrocious
temper
;
he
had
been
cursed
by
a
half-mad
wife
,
*NL*
who
drank
and
went
on
the
streets
.
His
daughter
was
totally
mad
--
and
yet
*NL*
he
believed
in
the
goodness
of
human
nature
.
He
believed
that
Leonora
*NL*
would
take
the
trouble
to
go
all
the
way
to
Ceylon
in
order
to
soothe
*NL*
his
daughter
.
Leonora
would
n't
.
Leonora
did
n't
ever
want
to
see
Nancy
*NL*
again
.
I
daresay
that
that
,
in
the
circumstances
,
was
natural
enough
.
*NL*
At
the
same
time
she
agreed
,
as
it
were
,
on
public
grounds
,
that
someone
*NL*
soothing
ought
to
go
from
Branshaw
to
Ceylon
.
She
sent
me
and
her
old
*NL*
nurse
,
who
had
looked
after
Nancy
from
the
time
when
the
girl
,
a
child
*NL*
of
thirteen
,
had
first
come
to
Branshaw
.
So
off
I
go
,
rushing
through
*NL*
Provence
,
to
catch
the
steamer
at
Marseilles
.
And
I
was
n't
the
least
*NL*
good
when
I
got
to
Ceylon
;
and
the
nurse
was
n't
the
least
good
.
Nothing
*NL*
has
been
the
least
good
.
The
doctors
said
,
at
Kandy
,
that
if
Nancy
could
*NL*
be
brought
to
England
,
the
sea
air
,
the
change
of
climate
,
the
voyage
,
*NL*
and
all
the
usual
sort
of
things
,
might
restore
her
reason
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
they
have
n't
restored
her
reason
.
She
is
,
I
am
aware
,
sitting
in
the
*NL*
hall
,
forty
paces
from
where
I
am
now
writing
.
I
do
n't
want
to
be
in
the
*NL*
least
romantic
about
it
.
She
is
very
well
dressed
;
she
is
quite
quiet
;
*NL*
she
is
very
beautiful
.
The
old
nurse
looks
after
her
very
efficiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
you
have
the
makings
of
a
situation
here
,
but
it
is
all
very
*NL*
humdrum
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
.
I
should
marry
Nancy
if
her
reason
*NL*
were
ever
sufficiently
restored
to
let
her
appreciate
the
meaning
of
the
*NL*
Anglican
marriage
service
.
But
it
is
probable
that
her
reason
will
*NL*
never
be
sufficiently
restored
to
let
her
appreciate
the
meaning
of
the
*NL*
Anglican
marriage
service
.
Therefore
I
can
not
marry
her
,
according
to
*NL*
the
law
of
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
here
I
am
very
much
where
I
started
thirteen
years
ago
.
I
am
the
*NL*
attendant
,
not
the
husband
,
of
a
beautiful
girl
,
who
pays
no
attention
*NL*
to
me
.
I
am
estranged
from
Leonora
,
who
married
Rodney
Bayham
in
my
*NL*
absence
and
went
to
live
at
Bayham
.
Leonora
rather
dislikes
me
,
because
*NL*
she
has
got
it
into
her
head
that
I
disapprove
of
her
marriage
with
*NL*
Rodney
Bayham
.
Well
,
I
disapprove
of
her
marriage
.
Possibly
I
am
*NL*
jealous
.
Yes
,
no
doubt
I
am
jealous
.
In
my
fainter
sort
of
way
I
seem
to
*NL*
perceive
myself
following
the
lines
of
Edward
Ashburnham
.
I
suppose
that
*NL*
I
should
really
like
to
be
a
polygamist
;
with
Nancy
,
and
with
Leonora
,
*NL*
and
with
Maisie
Maidan
and
possibly
even
with
Florence
.
I
am
no
doubt
*NL*
like
every
other
man
;
only
,
probably
because
of
my
American
origin
I
am
*NL*
fainter
.
At
the
same
time
I
am
able
to
assure
you
that
I
am
a
strictly
*NL*
respectable
person
.
I
have
never
done
anything
that
the
most
anxious
*NL*
mother
of
a
daughter
or
the
most
careful
dean
of
a
cathedral
would
*NL*
object
to
.
I
have
only
followed
,
faintly
,
and
in
my
unconscious
desires
,
*NL*
Edward
Ashburnham
.
Well
,
it
is
all
over
.
Not
one
of
us
has
got
what
he
*NL*
really
wanted
.
Leonora
wanted
Edward
,
and
she
has
got
Rodney
Bayham
,
a
*NL*
pleasant
enough
sort
of
sheep
.
Florence
wanted
Branshaw
,
and
it
is
I
*NL*
who
have
bought
it
from
Leonora
.
I
did
n't
really
want
it
;
what
I
*NL*
wanted
mostly
was
to
cease
being
a
nurse-attendant
.
Well
,
I
am
a
*NL*
nurse-attendant
.
Edward
wanted
Nancy
Rufford
,
and
I
have
got
her
.
Only
*NL*
she
is
mad
.
It
is
a
queer
and
fantastic
world
.
Why
ca
n't
people
have
*NL*
what
they
want
?
The
things
were
all
there
to
content
everybody
;
yet
*NL*
everybody
has
the
wrong
thing
.
Perhaps
you
can
make
head
or
tail
of
it
;
*NL*
it
is
beyond
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
there
any
terrestial
paradise
where
,
amidst
the
whispering
of
the
*NL*
olive-leaves
,
people
can
be
with
whom
they
like
and
have
what
they
like
*NL*
and
take
their
ease
in
shadows
and
in
coolness
?
Or
are
all
men
's
lives
*NL*
like
the
lives
of
us
good
people
--
like
the
lives
of
the
Ashburnhams
,
*NL*
of
the
Dowells
,
of
the
Ruffords
--
broken
,
tumultuous
,
agonized
,
and
*NL*
unromantic
,
lives
,
periods
punctuated
by
screams
,
by
imbecilities
,
by
*NL*
deaths
,
by
agonies
?
Who
the
devil
knows
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
there
was
a
great
deal
of
imbecility
about
the
closing
scenes
of
the
*NL*
Ashburnham
tragedy
.
Neither
of
those
two
women
knew
what
they
wanted
.
It
*NL*
was
only
Edward
who
took
a
perfectly
clear
line
,
and
he
was
drunk
most
*NL*
of
the
time
.
But
,
drunk
or
sober
,
he
stuck
to
what
was
demanded
by
*NL*
convention
and
by
the
traditions
of
his
house
.
Nancy
Rufford
had
to
be
*NL*
exported
to
India
,
and
Nancy
Rufford
had
n't
to
hear
a
word
of
love
from
*NL*
him
.
She
was
exported
to
India
and
she
never
heard
a
word
from
Edward
*NL*
Ashburnham
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
conventional
line
;
it
was
in
tune
with
the
tradition
of
*NL*
Edward
's
house
.
I
daresay
it
worked
out
for
the
greatest
good
of
the
*NL*
body
politic
.
Conventions
and
traditions
,
I
suppose
,
work
blindly
but
*NL*
surely
for
the
preservation
of
the
normal
type
;
for
the
extinction
of
*NL*
proud
,
resolute
and
unusual
individuals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
was
the
normal
man
,
but
there
was
too
much
of
the
sentimentalist
*NL*
about
him
;
and
society
does
not
need
too
many
sentimentalists
.
Nancy
was
*NL*
a
splendid
creature
,
but
she
had
about
her
a
touch
of
madness
.
Society
*NL*
does
not
need
individuals
with
touches
of
madness
about
them
.
So
Edward
*NL*
and
Nancy
found
themselves
steamrolled
out
and
Leonora
survives
,
the
*NL*
perfectly
normal
type
,
married
to
a
man
who
is
rather
like
a
rabbit
.
*NL*
For
Rodney
Bayham
is
rather
like
a
rabbit
,
and
I
hear
that
Leonora
is
*NL*
expected
to
have
a
baby
in
three
months
'
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
those
splendid
and
tumultuous
creatures
with
their
magnetism
and
*NL*
their
passions
--
those
two
that
I
really
loved
--
have
gone
from
this
*NL*
earth
.
It
is
no
doubt
best
for
them
.
What
would
Nancy
have
made
of
*NL*
Edward
if
she
had
succeeded
in
living
with
him
;
what
would
Edward
have
*NL*
made
of
her
?
For
there
was
about
Nancy
a
touch
of
cruelty
--
a
touch
of
*NL*
definite
actual
cruelty
that
made
her
desire
to
see
people
suffer
.
Yes
,
*NL*
she
desired
to
see
Edward
suffer
.
And
,
by
God
,
she
gave
him
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
an
unimaginable
hell
.
Those
two
women
pursued
that
poor
*NL*
devil
and
flayed
the
skin
off
him
as
if
they
had
done
it
with
whips
.
I
*NL*
tell
you
his
mind
bled
almost
visibly
.
I
seem
to
see
him
stand
,
naked
to
*NL*
the
waist
,
his
forearms
shielding
his
eyes
,
and
flesh
hanging
from
him
*NL*
in
rags
.
I
tell
you
that
is
no
exaggeration
of
what
I
feel
.
It
was
as
*NL*
if
Leonora
and
Nancy
banded
themselves
together
to
do
execution
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
humanity
,
upon
the
body
of
a
man
who
was
at
their
disposal
.
They
*NL*
were
like
a
couple
of
Sioux
who
had
got
hold
of
an
Apache
and
had
him
*NL*
well
tied
to
a
stake
.
I
tell
you
there
was
no
end
to
the
tortures
they
*NL*
inflicted
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
after
night
he
would
hear
them
talking
;
talking
;
maddened
,
*NL*
sweating
,
seeking
oblivion
in
drink
,
he
would
lie
there
and
hear
the
*NL*
voices
going
on
and
on
.
And
day
after
day
Leonora
would
come
to
him
and
*NL*
would
announce
the
results
of
their
deliberations
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
like
judges
debating
over
the
sentence
upon
a
criminal
;
they
*NL*
were
like
ghouls
with
an
immobile
corpse
in
a
tomb
beside
them
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
that
Leonora
was
any
more
to
blame
than
the
girl
--
though
Leonora
*NL*
was
the
more
active
of
the
two
.
Leonora
,
as
I
have
said
,
was
the
*NL*
perfectly
normal
woman
.
I
mean
to
say
that
in
normal
circumstances
her
*NL*
desires
were
those
of
the
woman
who
is
needed
by
society
.
She
desired
*NL*
children
,
decorum
,
an
establishment
;
she
desired
to
avoid
waste
,
she
*NL*
desired
to
keep
up
appearances
.
She
was
utterly
and
entirely
normal
even
*NL*
in
her
utterly
undeniable
beauty
.
But
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
she
acted
*NL*
perfectly
normally
in
this
perfectly
abnormal
situation
.
All
the
world
*NL*
was
mad
around
her
and
she
herself
,
agonized
,
took
on
the
complexion
of
*NL*
a
mad
woman
;
of
a
woman
very
wicked
;
of
the
villain
of
the
piece
.
What
*NL*
would
you
have
?
Steel
is
a
normal
,
hard
,
polished
substance
.
But
,
if
you
*NL*
put
it
in
a
hot
fire
it
will
become
red
,
soft
,
and
not
to
be
handled
.
If
*NL*
you
put
it
in
a
fire
still
more
hot
it
will
drip
away
.
It
was
like
*NL*
that
with
Leonora
.
She
was
made
for
normal
circumstances
--
for
Mr
Rodney
*NL*
Bayham
,
who
will
keep
a
separate
establishment
,
secretly
,
in
Portsmouth
,
*NL*
and
make
occasional
trips
to
Paris
and
to
Budapest
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
case
of
Edward
and
the
girl
,
Leonora
broke
and
simply
went
all
*NL*
over
the
place
.
She
adopted
unfamiliar
and
therefore
extraordinary
and
*NL*
ungraceful
attitudes
of
mind
.
At
one
moment
she
was
all
for
revenge
.
*NL*
After
haranguing
the
girl
for
hours
through
the
night
she
harangued
for
*NL*
hours
of
the
day
the
silent
Edward
.
And
Edward
just
once
tripped
up
,
and
*NL*
that
was
his
undoing
.
Perhaps
he
had
had
too
much
whisky
that
afternoon
.
*NL*
She
asked
him
perpetually
what
he
wanted
.
What
did
he
want
?
What
did
he
*NL*
want
?
And
all
he
ever
answered
was
:
``
I
have
told
you
''
.
He
meant
that
*NL*
he
wanted
the
girl
to
go
to
her
father
in
India
as
soon
as
her
father
*NL*
should
cable
that
he
was
ready
to
receive
her
.
But
just
once
he
tripped
*NL*
up
.
To
Leonora
's
eternal
question
he
answered
that
all
he
desired
in
*NL*
life
was
that
--
that
he
could
pick
himself
together
again
and
go
on
with
*NL*
his
daily
occupations
if
--
the
girl
,
being
five
thousand
miles
away
,
*NL*
would
continue
to
love
him
.
He
wanted
nothing
more
,
He
prayed
his
God
*NL*
for
nothing
more
.
Well
,
he
was
a
sentimentalist
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
moment
that
she
heard
that
,
Leonora
determined
that
the
girl
*NL*
should
not
go
five
thousand
miles
away
and
that
she
should
not
continue
*NL*
to
love
Edward
.
The
way
she
worked
it
was
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
to
tell
the
girl
that
she
must
belong
to
Edward
;
she
was
*NL*
going
to
get
a
divorce
;
she
was
going
to
get
a
dissolution
of
marriage
*NL*
from
Rome
.
But
she
considered
it
to
be
her
duty
to
warn
the
girl
of
the
*NL*
sort
of
monster
that
Edward
was
.
She
told
the
girl
of
La
Dolciquita
,
of
*NL*
Mrs
Basil
,
of
Maisie
Maidan
,
of
Florence
.
She
spoke
of
the
agonies
*NL*
that
she
had
endured
during
her
life
with
the
man
,
who
was
violent
,
*NL*
overbearing
,
vain
,
drunken
,
arrogant
,
and
monstrously
a
prey
to
his
*NL*
sexual
necessities
.
And
,
at
hearing
of
the
miseries
her
aunt
had
*NL*
suffered
--
for
Leonora
once
more
had
the
aspect
of
an
aunt
to
the
*NL*
girl
--
with
the
swift
cruelty
of
youth
and
,
with
the
swift
solidarity
*NL*
that
attaches
woman
to
woman
,
the
girl
made
her
resolves
.
Her
aunt
said
*NL*
incessantly
:
``
You
must
save
Edward
's
life
;
you
must
save
his
life
.
All
*NL*
that
he
needs
is
a
little
period
of
satisfaction
from
you
.
Then
he
will
*NL*
tire
of
you
as
he
has
of
the
others
.
But
you
must
save
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
all
the
while
,
that
wretched
fellow
knew
--
by
a
curious
instinct
*NL*
that
runs
between
human
beings
living
together
--
exactly
what
was
going
*NL*
on
.
And
he
remained
dumb
;
he
stretched
out
no
finger
to
help
himself
.
*NL*
All
that
he
required
to
keep
himself
a
decent
member
of
society
was
,
*NL*
that
the
girl
,
five
thousand
miles
away
,
should
continue
to
love
him
.
*NL*
They
were
putting
a
stopper
upon
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
told
you
that
the
girl
came
one
night
to
his
room
.
And
that
*NL*
was
the
real
hell
for
him
.
That
was
the
picture
that
never
left
his
*NL*
imagination
--
the
girl
,
in
the
dim
light
,
rising
up
at
the
foot
of
his
*NL*
bed
.
He
said
that
it
seemed
to
have
a
greenish
sort
of
effect
as
if
*NL*
there
were
a
greenish
tinge
in
the
shadows
of
the
tall
bedposts
that
*NL*
framed
her
body
.
And
she
looked
at
him
with
her
straight
eyes
of
an
*NL*
unflinching
cruelty
and
she
said
:
``
I
am
ready
to
belong
to
you
--
to
save
*NL*
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
:
``
I
do
n't
want
it
;
I
do
n't
want
it
;
I
do
n't
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
says
that
he
did
n't
want
it
;
that
he
would
have
hated
himself
;
*NL*
that
it
was
unthinkable
.
And
all
the
while
he
had
the
immense
temptation
*NL*
to
do
the
unthinkable
thing
,
not
from
the
physical
desire
but
because
of
*NL*
a
mental
certitude
.
He
was
certain
that
if
she
had
once
submitted
to
him
*NL*
she
would
remain
his
for
ever
.
He
knew
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
thinking
that
her
aunt
had
said
he
had
desired
her
to
love
him
*NL*
from
a
distance
of
five
thousand
miles
.
She
said
:
``
I
can
never
love
you
*NL*
now
I
know
the
kind
of
man
you
are
.
I
will
belong
to
you
to
save
your
*NL*
life
.
But
I
can
never
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fantastic
display
of
cruelty
.
She
did
n't
in
the
least
know
*NL*
what
it
meant
--
to
belong
to
a
man
.
But
,
at
that
Edward
pulled
himself
*NL*
together
.
He
spoke
in
his
normal
tones
;
gruff
,
husky
,
overbearing
,
as
he
*NL*
would
have
done
to
a
servant
or
to
a
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
back
to
your
room
,
''
he
said
.
``
Go
back
to
your
room
and
go
to
sleep
.
*NL*
This
is
all
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
baffled
,
those
two
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
I
came
on
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
MY
coming
on
the
scene
certainly
calmed
things
down
--
for
the
whole
*NL*
fortnight
that
intervened
between
my
arrival
and
the
girl
's
departure
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
the
endless
talking
did
not
go
on
at
night
or
*NL*
that
Leonora
did
not
send
me
out
with
the
girl
and
,
in
the
interval
,
*NL*
give
Edward
a
hell
of
a
time
.
Having
discovered
what
he
wanted
--
that
*NL*
the
girl
should
go
five
thousand
miles
away
and
love
him
steadfastly
*NL*
as
people
do
in
sentimental
novels
,
she
was
determined
to
smash
that
*NL*
aspiration
.
And
she
repeated
to
Edward
in
every
possible
tone
that
the
*NL*
girl
did
not
love
him
;
that
the
girl
detested
him
for
his
brutality
,
his
*NL*
overbearingness
,
his
drinking
habits
.
She
pointed
out
that
Edward
in
the
*NL*
girl
's
eyes
,
was
already
pledged
three
or
four
deep
.
He
was
pledged
to
*NL*
Leonora
herself
,
to
Mrs
Basil
,
and
to
the
memories
of
Maisie
Maidan
and
*NL*
to
Florence
.
Edward
never
said
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
the
girl
love
Edward
,
or
did
n't
she
?
I
do
n't
know
.
At
that
time
I
*NL*
daresay
she
did
n't
though
she
certainly
had
done
so
before
Leonora
had
*NL*
got
to
work
upon
his
reputation
.
She
certainly
had
loved
him
for
what
*NL*
I
call
the
public
side
of
his
record
--
for
his
good
soldiering
,
for
his
*NL*
saving
lives
at
sea
,
for
the
excellent
landlord
that
he
was
and
the
good
*NL*
sportsman
.
But
it
is
quite
possible
that
all
those
things
came
to
*NL*
appear
as
nothing
in
her
eyes
when
she
discovered
that
he
was
n't
a
good
*NL*
husband
.
For
,
though
women
,
as
I
see
them
,
have
little
or
no
feeling
of
*NL*
responsibility
towards
a
county
or
a
country
or
a
career
--
although
they
*NL*
may
be
entirely
lacking
in
any
kind
of
communal
solidarity
--
they
have
*NL*
an
immense
and
automatically
working
instinct
that
attaches
them
to
the
*NL*
interest
of
womanhood
.
It
is
,
of
course
,
possible
for
any
woman
to
cut
*NL*
out
and
to
carry
off
any
other
woman
's
husband
or
lover
.
But
I
rather
*NL*
think
that
a
woman
will
only
do
this
if
she
has
reason
to
believe
that
*NL*
the
other
woman
has
given
her
husband
a
bad
time
.
I
am
certain
that
*NL*
if
she
thinks
the
man
has
been
a
brute
to
his
wife
she
will
,
with
her
*NL*
instinctive
feeling
for
suffering
femininity
,
``
put
him
back
''
,
as
*NL*
the
saying
is
.
I
do
n't
attach
any
particular
importance
to
these
*NL*
generalizations
of
mine
.
They
may
be
right
,
they
may
be
wrong
;
I
am
only
*NL*
an
ageing
American
with
very
little
knowledge
of
life
.
You
may
take
my
*NL*
generalizations
or
leave
them
.
But
I
am
pretty
certain
that
I
am
right
*NL*
in
the
case
of
Nancy
Rufford
--
that
she
had
loved
Edward
Ashburnham
very
*NL*
deeply
and
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
nothing
to
the
point
that
she
let
him
have
it
good
and
strong
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
discovered
that
he
had
been
unfaithful
to
Leonora
and
that
*NL*
his
public
services
had
cost
more
than
Leonora
thought
they
ought
to
*NL*
have
cost
.
Nancy
would
be
bound
to
let
him
have
it
good
and
strong
then
.
*NL*
She
would
owe
that
to
feminine
public
opinion
;
she
would
be
driven
to
it
*NL*
by
the
instinct
for
self-preservation
,
since
she
might
well
imagine
*NL*
that
if
Edward
had
been
unfaithful
to
Leonora
,
to
Mrs
Basil
and
to
the
*NL*
memories
of
the
other
two
,
he
might
be
unfaithful
to
herself
.
And
,
*NL*
no
doubt
,
she
had
her
share
of
the
sex
instinct
that
makes
women
be
*NL*
intolerably
cruel
to
the
beloved
person
.
Anyhow
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
,
*NL*
at
this
point
,
Nancy
Rufford
loved
Edward
Ashburnham
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
whether
she
even
loved
him
when
,
on
getting
,
at
Aden
,
the
news
of
his
*NL*
suicide
she
went
mad
.
Because
that
may
just
as
well
have
been
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
Leonora
as
for
the
sake
of
Edward
.
Or
it
may
have
been
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
both
of
them
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
know
nothing
.
I
am
very
tired
.
*NL*
Leonora
held
passionately
the
doctrine
that
the
girl
did
n't
love
Edward
.
*NL*
She
wanted
desperately
to
believe
that
.
It
was
a
doctrine
as
necessary
*NL*
to
her
existence
as
a
belief
in
the
personal
immortality
of
the
soul
.
*NL*
She
said
that
it
was
impossible
that
Nancy
could
have
loved
Edward
*NL*
after
she
had
given
the
girl
her
view
of
Edward
's
career
and
character
.
*NL*
Edward
,
on
the
other
hand
,
believed
maunderingly
that
some
essential
*NL*
attractiveness
in
himself
must
have
made
the
girl
continue
to
go
on
*NL*
loving
him
--
to
go
on
loving
him
,
as
it
were
,
in
underneath
her
official
*NL*
aspect
of
hatred
.
He
thought
she
only
pretended
to
hate
him
in
order
*NL*
to
save
her
face
and
he
thought
that
her
quite
atrocious
telegram
from
*NL*
Brindisi
was
only
another
attempt
to
do
that
--
to
prove
that
she
had
*NL*
feelings
creditable
to
a
member
of
the
feminine
commonweal
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
.
I
leave
it
to
you
.
There
is
another
point
that
worries
me
a
good
*NL*
deal
in
the
aspects
of
this
sad
affair
.
Leonora
says
that
,
in
desiring
*NL*
that
the
girl
should
go
five
thousand
miles
away
and
yet
continue
to
*NL*
love
him
,
Edward
was
a
monster
of
selfishness
.
He
was
desiring
the
ruin
*NL*
of
a
young
life
.
Edward
on
the
other
hand
put
it
to
me
that
,
supposing
*NL*
that
the
girl
's
love
was
a
necessity
to
his
existence
,
and
,
if
he
did
*NL*
nothing
by
word
or
by
action
to
keep
Nancy
's
love
alive
,
he
could
n't
be
*NL*
called
selfish
.
Leonora
replied
that
showed
he
had
an
abominably
selfish
*NL*
nature
even
though
his
actions
might
be
perfectly
correct
.
I
ca
n't
make
*NL*
out
which
of
them
was
right
.
I
leave
it
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
,
at
any
rate
,
certain
that
Edward
's
actions
were
perfectly
--
were
*NL*
monstrously
,
were
cruelly
--
correct
.
He
sat
still
and
let
Leonora
take
*NL*
away
his
character
,
and
let
Leonora
damn
him
to
deepest
hell
,
without
*NL*
stirring
a
finger
.
I
daresay
he
was
a
fool
;
I
do
n't
see
what
object
*NL*
there
was
in
letting
the
girl
think
worse
of
him
than
was
necessary
.
*NL*
Still
there
it
is
.
And
there
it
is
also
that
all
those
three
presented
*NL*
to
the
world
the
spectacle
of
being
the
best
of
good
people
.
I
assure
*NL*
you
that
during
my
stay
for
that
fortnight
in
that
fine
old
house
,
I
*NL*
never
so
much
as
noticed
a
single
thing
that
could
have
affected
that
*NL*
good
opinion
.
And
even
when
I
look
back
,
knowing
the
circumstances
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
remember
a
single
thing
any
of
them
said
that
could
have
betrayed
*NL*
them
.
I
ca
n't
remember
,
right
up
to
the
dinner
,
when
Leonora
read
out
*NL*
that
telegram
--
not
the
tremor
of
an
eyelash
,
not
the
shaking
of
a
hand
.
*NL*
It
was
just
a
pleasant
country
house-party
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Leonora
kept
it
up
jolly
well
,
for
even
longer
than
that
--
she
kept
*NL*
it
up
as
far
as
I
was
concerned
until
eight
days
after
Edward
's
funeral
.
*NL*
Immediately
after
that
particular
dinner
--
the
dinner
at
which
I
*NL*
received
the
announcement
that
Nancy
was
going
to
leave
for
India
on
the
*NL*
following
day
--
I
asked
Leonora
to
let
me
have
a
word
with
her
.
She
took
*NL*
me
into
her
little
sitting-room
and
I
then
said
--
I
spare
you
the
record
*NL*
of
my
emotions
--
that
she
was
aware
that
I
wished
to
marry
Nancy
;
that
*NL*
she
had
seemed
to
favour
my
suit
and
that
it
appeared
to
be
rather
a
*NL*
waste
of
money
upon
tickets
and
rather
a
waste
of
time
upon
travel
to
*NL*
let
the
girl
go
to
India
if
Leonora
thought
that
there
was
any
chance
of
*NL*
her
marrying
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Leonora
,
I
assure
you
,
was
the
absolutely
perfect
British
matron
.
*NL*
She
said
that
she
quite
favoured
my
suit
;
that
she
could
not
desire
for
*NL*
the
girl
a
better
husband
;
but
that
she
considered
that
the
girl
ought
*NL*
to
see
a
little
more
of
life
before
taking
such
an
important
step
.
Yes
,
*NL*
Leonora
used
the
words
``
taking
such
an
important
step
''
.
She
was
perfect
.
*NL*
Actually
,
I
think
she
would
have
liked
the
girl
to
marry
me
enough
but
*NL*
my
programme
included
the
buying
of
the
Kershaw
's
house
about
a
mile
*NL*
away
upon
the
Fordingbridge
road
,
and
settling
down
there
with
the
girl
.
*NL*
That
did
n't
at
all
suit
Leonora
.
She
did
n't
want
to
have
the
girl
within
*NL*
a
mile
and
a
half
of
Edward
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
.
Still
,
I
think
*NL*
she
might
have
managed
to
let
me
know
,
in
some
periphrasis
or
other
,
*NL*
that
I
might
have
the
girl
if
I
would
take
her
to
Philadelphia
or
*NL*
Timbuctoo
.
I
loved
Nancy
very
much
--
and
Leonora
knew
it
.
However
,
I
left
*NL*
it
at
that
.
I
left
it
with
the
understanding
that
Nancy
was
going
*NL*
away
to
India
on
probation
.
It
seemed
to
me
a
perfectly
reasonable
*NL*
arrangement
and
I
am
a
reasonable
sort
of
man
.
I
simply
said
that
I
*NL*
should
follow
Nancy
out
to
India
after
six
months
'
time
or
so
.
Or
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
after
a
year
.
Well
,
you
see
,
I
did
follow
Nancy
out
to
India
*NL*
after
a
year
...
I
must
confess
to
having
felt
a
little
angry
with
*NL*
Leonora
for
not
having
warned
me
earlier
that
the
girl
would
be
going
.
*NL*
I
took
it
as
one
of
the
queer
,
not
very
straight
methods
that
Roman
*NL*
Catholics
seem
to
adopt
in
dealing
with
matters
of
this
world
.
I
took
*NL*
it
that
Leonora
had
been
afraid
I
should
propose
to
the
girl
or
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
,
have
made
considerably
greater
advances
to
her
than
I
did
,
if
I
*NL*
had
known
earlier
that
she
was
going
away
so
soon
.
Perhaps
Leonora
*NL*
was
right
;
perhaps
Roman
Catholics
,
with
their
queer
,
shifty
ways
,
are
*NL*
always
right
.
They
are
dealing
with
the
queer
,
shifty
thing
that
is
*NL*
human
nature
.
For
it
is
quite
possible
that
,
if
I
had
known
Nancy
was
*NL*
going
away
so
soon
,
I
should
have
tried
making
love
to
her
.
And
that
*NL*
would
have
produced
another
complication
.
It
may
have
been
just
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
queer
the
fantastic
things
that
quite
good
people
will
do
in
order
*NL*
to
keep
up
their
appearance
of
calm
pococurantism
.
For
Edward
Ashburnham
*NL*
and
his
wife
called
me
half
the
world
over
in
order
to
sit
on
the
back
*NL*
seat
of
a
dog-cart
whilst
Edward
drove
the
girl
to
the
railway
station
*NL*
from
which
she
was
to
take
her
departure
to
India
.
They
wanted
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
to
have
a
witness
of
the
calmness
of
that
function
.
The
girl
's
*NL*
luggage
had
been
already
packed
and
sent
off
before
.
Her
berth
on
the
*NL*
steamer
had
been
taken
.
They
had
timed
it
all
so
exactly
that
it
went
*NL*
like
clockwork
.
They
had
known
the
date
upon
which
Colonel
Rufford
would
*NL*
get
Edward
's
letter
and
they
had
known
almost
exactly
the
hour
at
which
*NL*
they
would
receive
his
telegram
asking
his
daughter
to
come
to
him
.
It
*NL*
had
all
been
quite
beautifully
and
quite
mercilessly
arranged
,
by
Edward
*NL*
himself
.
They
gave
Colonel
Rufford
,
as
a
reason
for
telegraphing
,
the
*NL*
fact
that
Mrs
Colonel
Somebody
or
other
would
be
travelling
by
that
ship
*NL*
and
that
she
would
serve
as
an
efficient
chaperon
for
the
girl
.
It
was
a
*NL*
most
amazing
business
,
and
I
think
that
it
would
have
been
better
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
God
if
they
had
all
attempted
to
gouge
out
each
other
's
eyes
*NL*
with
carving
knives
.
But
they
were
``
good
people
''
.
After
my
interview
*NL*
with
Leonora
I
went
desultorily
into
Edward
's
gun-room
.
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
where
the
girl
was
and
I
thought
I
might
find
her
there
.
I
suppose
I
had
*NL*
a
vague
idea
of
proposing
to
her
in
spite
of
Leonora
.
So
,
I
presume
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
come
of
quite
such
good
people
as
the
Ashburnhams
.
Edward
was
*NL*
lounging
in
his
chair
smoking
a
cigar
and
he
said
nothing
for
quite
five
*NL*
minutes
.
The
candles
glowed
in
the
green
shades
;
the
reflections
were
*NL*
green
in
the
glasses
of
the
book-cases
that
held
guns
and
fishing-rods
.
*NL*
Over
the
mantelpiece
was
the
brownish
picture
of
the
white
horse
.
Those
*NL*
were
the
quietest
moments
that
I
have
ever
known
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
Edward
*NL*
looked
me
straight
in
the
eyes
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
old
man
,
I
wish
you
would
drive
with
Nancy
and
me
to
the
*NL*
station
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
that
of
course
I
would
drive
with
him
and
Nancy
to
the
station
on
*NL*
the
morrow
.
He
lay
there
for
a
long
time
,
looking
along
the
line
of
his
*NL*
knees
at
the
fluttering
fire
,
and
then
suddenly
,
in
a
perfectly
calm
*NL*
voice
,
and
without
lifting
his
eyes
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
desperately
in
love
with
Nancy
Rufford
that
I
am
dying
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
devil
--
he
had
n't
meant
to
speak
of
it
.
But
I
guess
he
just
had
to
*NL*
speak
to
somebody
and
I
appeared
to
be
like
a
woman
or
a
solicitor
.
He
*NL*
talked
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
carried
out
the
programme
to
the
last
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
clear
winter
morning
,
with
a
good
deal
of
frost
in
it
.
*NL*
The
sun
was
quite
bright
,
the
winding
road
between
the
heather
and
the
*NL*
bracken
was
very
hard
.
I
sat
on
the
back-seat
of
the
dog-cart
;
Nancy
was
*NL*
beside
Edward
.
They
talked
about
the
way
the
cob
went
;
Edward
pointed
*NL*
out
with
the
whip
a
cluster
of
deer
upon
a
coombe
three-quarters
of
a
*NL*
mile
away
.
We
passed
the
hounds
in
the
level
bit
of
road
beside
the
high
*NL*
trees
going
into
Fordingbridge
and
Edward
pulled
up
the
dog-cart
so
that
*NL*
Nancy
might
say
good-bye
to
the
huntsman
and
cap
him
a
last
sovereign
.
*NL*
She
had
ridden
with
those
hounds
ever
since
she
had
been
thirteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
was
five
minutes
late
and
they
imagined
that
that
was
because
*NL*
it
was
market-day
at
Swindon
or
wherever
the
train
came
from
.
That
was
*NL*
the
sort
of
thing
they
talked
about
.
The
train
came
in
;
Edward
found
her
*NL*
a
first-class
carriage
with
an
elderly
woman
in
it
.
The
girl
entered
the
*NL*
carriage
,
Edward
closed
the
door
and
then
she
put
out
her
hand
to
shake
*NL*
mine
.
There
was
upon
those
people
's
faces
no
expression
of
any
kind
*NL*
whatever
.
The
signal
for
the
train
's
departure
was
a
very
bright
red
;
*NL*
that
is
about
as
passionate
a
statement
as
I
can
get
into
that
scene
.
*NL*
She
was
not
looking
her
best
;
she
had
on
a
cap
of
brown
fur
that
did
not
*NL*
very
well
match
her
hair
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
,
''
to
Edward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
answered
:
``
So
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
swung
round
on
his
heel
and
,
large
,
slouching
,
and
walking
with
a
*NL*
heavy
deliberate
pace
,
he
went
out
of
the
station
.
I
followed
him
*NL*
and
got
up
beside
him
in
the
high
dog-cart
.
It
was
the
most
horrible
*NL*
performance
I
have
ever
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
after
that
,
a
holy
peace
,
like
the
peace
of
God
which
passes
all
*NL*
understanding
,
descended
upon
Branshaw
Teleragh
.
Leonora
went
about
her
*NL*
daily
duties
with
a
sort
of
triumphant
smile
--
a
very
faint
smile
,
but
*NL*
quite
triumphant
.
I
guess
she
had
so
long
since
given
up
any
idea
of
*NL*
getting
her
man
back
that
it
was
enough
for
her
to
have
got
the
girl
out
*NL*
of
the
house
and
well
cured
of
her
infatuation
.
Once
,
in
the
hall
,
*NL*
when
Leonora
was
going
out
,
Edward
said
,
beneath
his
breath
--
but
I
just
*NL*
caught
the
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
conquered
,
O
pale
Galilean
.
''
It
was
like
his
sentimentality
*NL*
to
quote
Swinburne
.
But
he
was
perfectly
quiet
and
he
had
given
up
*NL*
drinking
.
The
only
thing
that
he
ever
said
to
me
after
that
drive
to
the
*NL*
station
was
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
odd
.
I
think
I
ought
to
tell
you
,
Dowell
,
that
I
have
n't
any
*NL*
feelings
at
all
about
the
girl
now
it
's
all
over
.
Do
n't
you
worry
about
*NL*
me
.
I
'm
all
right
.
''
A
long
time
afterwards
he
said
:
``
I
guess
it
was
only
*NL*
a
flash
in
the
pan
.
''
He
began
to
look
after
the
estates
again
;
he
*NL*
took
all
that
trouble
over
getting
off
the
gardener
's
daughter
who
had
*NL*
murdered
her
baby
.
He
shook
hands
smilingly
with
every
farmer
in
the
*NL*
market-place
.
He
addressed
two
political
meetings
;
he
hunted
twice
.
*NL*
Leonora
made
him
a
frightful
scene
about
spending
the
two
hundred
pounds
*NL*
on
getting
the
gardener
's
daughter
acquitted
.
Everything
went
on
as
if
*NL*
the
girl
had
never
existed
.
It
was
very
still
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
that
is
the
end
of
the
story
.
And
,
when
I
come
to
look
at
it
I
see
*NL*
that
it
is
a
happy
ending
with
wedding
bells
and
all
.
The
villains
--
for
*NL*
obviously
Edward
and
the
girl
were
villains
--
have
been
punished
by
*NL*
suicide
and
madness
.
The
heroine
--
the
perfectly
normal
,
virtuous
and
*NL*
slightly
deceitful
heroine
--
has
become
the
happy
wife
of
a
perfectly
*NL*
normal
,
virtuous
and
slightly
deceitful
husband
.
She
will
shortly
become
*NL*
a
mother
of
a
perfectly
normal
,
virtuous
slightly
deceitful
son
or
*NL*
daughter
.
A
happy
ending
,
that
is
what
it
works
out
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
conceal
from
myself
the
fact
that
I
now
dislike
Leonora
.
*NL*
Without
doubt
I
am
jealous
of
Rodney
Bayham
.
But
I
do
n't
know
whether
*NL*
it
is
merely
a
jealousy
arising
from
the
fact
that
I
desired
myself
to
*NL*
possess
Leonora
or
whether
it
is
because
to
her
were
sacrificed
the
only
*NL*
two
persons
that
I
have
ever
really
loved
--
Edward
Ashburnham
and
Nancy
*NL*
Rufford
.
In
order
to
set
her
up
in
a
modern
mansion
,
replete
with
*NL*
every
convenience
and
dominated
by
a
quite
respectable
and
eminently
*NL*
economical
master
of
the
house
,
it
was
necessary
that
Edward
and
Nancy
*NL*
Rufford
should
become
,
for
me
at
least
,
no
more
than
tragic
shades
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
seem
to
see
poor
Edward
,
naked
and
reclining
amidst
darkness
,
upon
*NL*
cold
rocks
,
like
one
of
the
ancient
Greek
damned
,
in
Tartarus
or
*NL*
wherever
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
for
Nancy
...
Well
,
yesterday
at
lunch
she
said
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shuttlecocks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
repeated
the
word
``
shuttlecocks
''
three
times
.
I
know
what
was
*NL*
passing
in
her
mind
,
if
she
can
be
said
to
have
a
mind
,
for
Leonora
has
*NL*
told
me
that
,
once
,
the
poor
girl
said
she
felt
like
a
shuttlecock
*NL*
being
tossed
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
violent
personalities
of
*NL*
Edward
and
his
wife
.
Leonora
,
she
said
,
was
always
trying
to
deliver
her
*NL*
over
to
Edward
,
and
Edward
tacitly
and
silently
forced
her
back
again
.
*NL*
And
the
odd
thing
was
that
Edward
himself
considered
that
those
two
*NL*
women
used
him
like
a
shuttlecock
.
Or
,
rather
,
he
said
that
they
sent
*NL*
him
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
blooming
parcel
that
someone
did
n't
*NL*
want
to
pay
the
postage
on
.
And
Leonora
also
imagined
that
Edward
and
*NL*
Nancy
picked
her
up
and
threw
her
down
as
suited
their
purely
vagrant
*NL*
moods
.
So
there
you
have
the
pretty
picture
.
Mind
,
I
am
not
preaching
*NL*
anything
contrary
to
accepted
morality
.
I
am
not
advocating
free
love
in
*NL*
this
or
any
other
case
.
Society
must
go
on
,
I
suppose
,
and
society
can
*NL*
only
exist
if
the
normal
,
if
the
virtuous
,
and
the
slightly
deceitful
*NL*
flourish
,
and
if
the
passionate
,
the
headstrong
,
and
the
too-truthful
*NL*
are
condemned
to
suicide
and
to
madness
.
But
I
guess
that
I
myself
,
*NL*
in
my
fainter
way
,
come
into
the
category
of
the
passionate
,
of
the
*NL*
headstrong
,
and
the
too-truthful
.
For
I
ca
n't
conceal
from
myself
the
*NL*
fact
that
I
loved
Edward
Ashburnham
--
and
that
I
love
him
because
he
was
*NL*
just
myself
.
If
I
had
had
the
courage
and
virility
and
possibly
also
the
*NL*
physique
of
Edward
Ashburnham
I
should
,
I
fancy
,
have
done
much
what
*NL*
he
did
.
He
seems
to
me
like
a
large
elder
brother
who
took
me
out
on
*NL*
several
excursions
and
did
many
dashing
things
whilst
I
just
watched
him
*NL*
robbing
the
orchards
,
from
a
distance
.
And
,
you
see
,
I
am
just
as
much
*NL*
of
a
sentimentalist
as
he
was
.
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
society
must
go
on
;
it
must
breed
,
like
rabbits
.
That
is
what
we
*NL*
are
here
for
.
But
then
,
I
do
n't
like
society
--
much
.
I
am
that
absurd
*NL*
figure
,
an
American
millionaire
,
who
has
bought
one
of
the
ancient
*NL*
haunts
of
English
peace
.
I
sit
here
,
in
Edward
's
gun-room
,
all
day
and
*NL*
all
day
in
a
house
that
is
absolutely
quiet
.
No
one
visits
me
,
for
I
*NL*
visit
no
one
.
No
one
is
interested
in
me
,
for
I
have
no
interests
.
In
*NL*
twenty
minutes
or
so
I
shall
walk
down
to
the
village
,
beneath
my
own
*NL*
oaks
,
alongside
my
own
clumps
of
gorse
,
to
get
the
American
mail
.
My
*NL*
tenants
,
the
village
boys
and
the
tradesmen
will
touch
their
hats
to
me
.
*NL*
So
life
peters
out
.
I
shall
return
to
dine
and
Nancy
will
sit
opposite
*NL*
me
with
the
old
nurse
standing
behind
her
.
Enigmatic
,
silent
,
utterly
*NL*
well-behaved
as
far
as
her
knife
and
fork
go
,
Nancy
will
stare
in
front
*NL*
of
her
with
the
blue
eyes
that
have
over
them
strained
,
stretched
brows
.
*NL*
Once
,
or
perhaps
twice
,
during
the
meal
her
knife
and
fork
will
be
*NL*
suspended
in
mid-air
as
if
she
were
trying
to
think
of
something
that
*NL*
she
had
forgotten
.
Then
she
will
say
that
she
believes
in
an
Omnipotent
*NL*
Deity
or
she
will
utter
the
one
word
``
shuttle-cocks
''
,
perhaps
.
It
is
*NL*
very
extraordinary
to
see
the
perfect
flush
of
health
on
her
cheeks
,
to
*NL*
see
the
lustre
of
her
coiled
black
hair
,
the
poise
of
the
head
upon
*NL*
the
neck
,
the
grace
of
the
white
hands
--
and
to
think
that
it
all
means
*NL*
nothing
--
that
it
is
a
picture
without
a
meaning
.
Yes
,
it
is
queer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
at
any
rate
,
there
is
always
Leonora
to
cheer
you
up
;
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
sadden
you
.
Her
husband
is
quite
an
economical
person
of
so
normal
*NL*
a
figure
that
he
can
get
quite
a
large
proportion
of
his
clothes
*NL*
ready-made
.
That
is
the
great
desideratum
of
life
,
and
that
is
the
end
*NL*
of
my
story
.
The
child
is
to
be
brought
up
as
a
Romanist
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
suddenly
occurs
to
me
that
I
have
forgotten
to
say
how
Edward
met
*NL*
his
death
.
You
remember
that
peace
had
descended
upon
the
house
;
that
*NL*
Leonora
was
quietly
triumphant
and
that
Edward
said
his
love
for
the
*NL*
girl
had
been
merely
a
passing
phase
.
Well
,
one
afternoon
we
were
in
*NL*
the
stables
together
,
looking
at
a
new
kind
of
flooring
that
Edward
was
*NL*
trying
in
a
loose-box
.
Edward
was
talking
with
a
good
deal
of
animation
*NL*
about
the
necessity
of
getting
the
numbers
of
the
Hampshire
territorials
*NL*
up
to
the
proper
standard
.
He
was
quite
sober
,
quite
quiet
,
his
skin
*NL*
was
clear-coloured
;
his
hair
was
golden
and
perfectly
brushed
;
the
*NL*
level
brick-dust
red
of
his
complexion
went
clean
up
to
the
rims
of
his
*NL*
eyelids
;
his
eyes
were
porcelain
blue
and
they
regarded
me
frankly
and
*NL*
directly
.
His
face
was
perfectly
expressionless
;
his
voice
was
deep
and
*NL*
rough
.
He
stood
well
back
upon
his
legs
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ought
to
get
them
up
to
two
thousand
three
hundred
and
fifty
.
''
*NL*
A
stable-boy
brought
him
a
telegram
and
went
away
.
He
opened
it
*NL*
negligently
,
regarded
it
without
emotion
,
and
,
in
complete
silence
,
*NL*
handed
it
to
me
.
On
the
pinkish
paper
in
a
sprawled
handwriting
I
read
:
*NL*
``
Safe
Brindisi
.
Having
rattling
good
time
.
Nancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
Edward
was
the
English
gentleman
;
but
he
was
also
,
to
the
last
,
*NL*
a
sentimentalist
,
whose
mind
was
compounded
of
indifferent
poems
and
*NL*
novels
.
He
just
looked
up
to
the
roof
of
the
stable
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
looking
to
Heaven
,
and
whispered
something
that
I
did
not
catch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
put
two
fingers
into
the
waistcoat
pocket
of
his
grey
,
frieze
*NL*
suit
;
they
came
out
with
a
little
neat
pen-knife
--
quite
a
small
*NL*
pen-knife
.
He
said
to
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
just
take
that
wire
to
Leonora
.
''
And
he
looked
at
me
with
a
*NL*
direct
,
challenging
,
brow-beating
glare
.
I
guess
he
could
see
in
my
eyes
*NL*
that
I
did
n't
intend
to
hinder
him
.
Why
should
I
hinder
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
think
he
was
wanted
in
the
world
,
let
his
confounded
tenants
,
*NL*
his
rifle-associations
,
his
drunkards
,
reclaimed
and
unreclaimed
,
get
on
*NL*
as
they
liked
.
Not
all
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
deserved
that
*NL*
that
poor
devil
should
go
on
suffering
for
their
sakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
that
I
did
not
intend
to
interfere
with
him
his
eyes
became
*NL*
soft
and
almost
affectionate
.
He
remarked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
,
old
man
,
I
must
have
a
bit
of
a
rest
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
know
what
to
say
.
I
wanted
to
say
,
``
God
bless
you
''
,
for
I
also
*NL*
am
a
sentimentalist
.
But
I
thought
that
perhaps
that
would
not
be
quite
*NL*
English
good
form
,
so
I
trotted
off
with
the
telegram
to
Leonora
.
She
*NL*
was
quite
pleased
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
