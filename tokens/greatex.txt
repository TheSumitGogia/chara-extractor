Chapter
I
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
's
family
name
being
Pirrip
,
and
my
Christian
name
Philip
,
my
*NL*
infant
tongue
could
make
of
both
names
nothing
longer
or
more
explicit
*NL*
than
Pip
.
So
,
I
called
myself
Pip
,
and
came
to
be
called
Pip
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
give
Pirrip
as
my
father
's
family
name
,
on
the
authority
of
his
*NL*
tombstone
and
my
sister
,
--
Mrs.
Joe
Gargery
,
who
married
the
blacksmith
.
*NL*
As
I
never
saw
my
father
or
my
mother
,
and
never
saw
any
likeness
*NL*
of
either
of
them
-LRB-
for
their
days
were
long
before
the
days
of
*NL*
photographs
-RRB-
,
my
first
fancies
regarding
what
they
were
like
were
*NL*
unreasonably
derived
from
their
tombstones
.
The
shape
of
the
letters
on
*NL*
my
father
's
,
gave
me
an
odd
idea
that
he
was
a
square
,
stout
,
dark
man
,
*NL*
with
curly
black
hair
.
From
the
character
and
turn
of
the
inscription
,
*NL*
``
Also
Georgiana
Wife
of
the
Above
,
''
I
drew
a
childish
conclusion
that
*NL*
my
mother
was
freckled
and
sickly
.
To
five
little
stone
lozenges
,
each
*NL*
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
,
which
were
arranged
in
a
neat
row
beside
*NL*
their
grave
,
and
were
sacred
to
the
memory
of
five
little
brothers
of
*NL*
mine
,
--
who
gave
up
trying
to
get
a
living
,
exceedingly
early
in
*NL*
that
universal
struggle
,
--
I
am
indebted
for
a
belief
I
religiously
*NL*
entertained
that
they
had
all
been
born
on
their
backs
with
their
hands
*NL*
in
their
trousers-pockets
,
and
had
never
taken
them
out
in
this
state
of
*NL*
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ours
was
the
marsh
country
,
down
by
the
river
,
within
,
as
the
river
*NL*
wound
,
twenty
miles
of
the
sea
.
My
first
most
vivid
and
broad
impression
*NL*
of
the
identity
of
things
seems
to
me
to
have
been
gained
on
a
memorable
*NL*
raw
afternoon
towards
evening
.
At
such
a
time
I
found
out
for
certain
*NL*
that
this
bleak
place
overgrown
with
nettles
was
the
churchyard
;
and
*NL*
that
Philip
Pirrip
,
late
of
this
parish
,
and
also
Georgiana
wife
of
the
*NL*
above
,
were
dead
and
buried
;
and
that
Alexander
,
Bartholomew
,
Abraham
,
*NL*
Tobias
,
and
Roger
,
infant
children
of
the
aforesaid
,
were
also
dead
*NL*
and
buried
;
and
that
the
dark
flat
wilderness
beyond
the
churchyard
,
*NL*
intersected
with
dikes
and
mounds
and
gates
,
with
scattered
cattle
*NL*
feeding
on
it
,
was
the
marshes
;
and
that
the
low
leaden
line
beyond
*NL*
was
the
river
;
and
that
the
distant
savage
lair
from
which
the
wind
was
*NL*
rushing
was
the
sea
;
and
that
the
small
bundle
of
shivers
growing
afraid
*NL*
of
it
all
and
beginning
to
cry
,
was
Pip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
noise
!
''
cried
a
terrible
voice
,
as
a
man
started
up
from
*NL*
among
the
graves
at
the
side
of
the
church
porch
.
``
Keep
still
,
you
*NL*
little
devil
,
or
I
'll
cut
your
throat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fearful
man
,
all
in
coarse
gray
,
with
a
great
iron
on
his
leg
.
A
man
*NL*
with
no
hat
,
and
with
broken
shoes
,
and
with
an
old
rag
tied
round
his
*NL*
head
.
A
man
who
had
been
soaked
in
water
,
and
smothered
in
mud
,
and
*NL*
lamed
by
stones
,
and
cut
by
flints
,
and
stung
by
nettles
,
and
torn
by
*NL*
briars
;
who
limped
,
and
shivered
,
and
glared
,
and
growled
;
and
whose
*NL*
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
as
he
seized
me
by
the
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Do
n't
cut
my
throat
,
sir
,
''
I
pleaded
in
terror
.
``
Pray
do
n't
do
it
,
*NL*
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
us
your
name
!
''
said
the
man
.
``
Quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
more
,
''
said
the
man
,
staring
at
me
.
``
Give
it
mouth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
.
Pip
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
us
where
you
live
,
''
said
the
man
.
``
Pint
out
the
place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
pointed
to
where
our
village
lay
,
on
the
flat
in-shore
among
the
*NL*
alder-trees
and
pollards
,
a
mile
or
more
from
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
,
after
looking
at
me
for
a
moment
,
turned
me
upside
down
,
and
*NL*
emptied
my
pockets
.
There
was
nothing
in
them
but
a
piece
of
bread
.
When
*NL*
the
church
came
to
itself
,
--
for
he
was
so
sudden
and
strong
that
he
*NL*
made
it
go
head
over
heels
before
me
,
and
I
saw
the
steeple
under
my
*NL*
feet
,
--
when
the
church
came
to
itself
,
I
say
,
I
was
seated
on
a
high
*NL*
tombstone
,
trembling
while
he
ate
the
bread
ravenously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
young
dog
,
''
said
the
man
,
licking
his
lips
,
``
what
fat
cheeks
you
*NL*
ha
'
got
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
they
were
fat
,
though
I
was
at
that
time
undersized
for
my
*NL*
years
,
and
not
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darn
me
if
I
could
n't
eat
em
,
''
said
the
man
,
with
a
threatening
shake
*NL*
of
his
head
,
``
and
if
I
ha
n't
half
a
mind
to
`
t
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
earnestly
expressed
my
hope
that
he
would
n't
,
and
held
tighter
to
*NL*
the
tombstone
on
which
he
had
put
me
;
partly
,
to
keep
myself
upon
it
;
*NL*
partly
,
to
keep
myself
from
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
lookee
here
!
''
said
the
man
.
``
Where
's
your
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
sir
!
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
,
made
a
short
run
,
and
stopped
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
sir
!
''
I
timidly
explained
.
``
Also
Georgiana
.
That
's
my
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
he
,
coming
back
.
``
And
is
that
your
father
alonger
your
*NL*
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
I
;
``
him
too
;
late
of
this
parish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
he
muttered
then
,
considering
.
``
Who
d'ye
live
with
,
--
supposin
'
*NL*
you
're
kindly
let
to
live
,
which
I
ha
n't
made
up
my
mind
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
,
sir
,
--
Mrs.
Joe
Gargery
,
--
wife
of
Joe
Gargery
,
the
*NL*
blacksmith
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blacksmith
,
eh
?
''
said
he
.
And
looked
down
at
his
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
darkly
looking
at
his
leg
and
me
several
times
,
he
came
closer
*NL*
to
my
tombstone
,
took
me
by
both
arms
,
and
tilted
me
back
as
far
as
he
*NL*
could
hold
me
;
so
that
his
eyes
looked
most
powerfully
down
into
mine
,
*NL*
and
mine
looked
most
helplessly
up
into
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
lookee
here
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
question
being
whether
you
're
to
be
let
*NL*
to
live
.
You
know
what
a
file
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
what
wittles
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
each
question
he
tilted
me
over
a
little
more
,
so
as
to
give
me
a
*NL*
greater
sense
of
helplessness
and
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
get
me
a
file
.
''
He
tilted
me
again
.
``
And
you
get
me
wittles
.
''
He
*NL*
tilted
me
again
.
``
You
bring
'em
both
to
me
.
''
He
tilted
me
again
.
``
Or
*NL*
I
'll
have
your
heart
and
liver
out
.
''
He
tilted
me
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
dreadfully
frightened
,
and
so
giddy
that
I
clung
to
him
with
both
*NL*
hands
,
and
said
,
``
If
you
would
kindly
please
to
let
me
keep
upright
,
*NL*
sir
,
perhaps
I
should
n't
be
sick
,
and
perhaps
I
could
attend
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
a
most
tremendous
dip
and
roll
,
so
that
the
church
jumped
*NL*
over
its
own
weathercock
.
Then
,
he
held
me
by
the
arms
,
in
an
upright
*NL*
position
on
the
top
of
the
stone
,
and
went
on
in
these
fearful
terms
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bring
me
,
to-morrow
morning
early
,
that
file
and
them
wittles
.
You
*NL*
bring
the
lot
to
me
,
at
that
old
Battery
over
yonder
.
You
do
it
,
and
you
*NL*
never
dare
to
say
a
word
or
dare
to
make
a
sign
concerning
your
having
*NL*
seen
such
a
person
as
me
,
or
any
person
sumever
,
and
you
shall
be
let
to
*NL*
live
.
You
fail
,
or
you
go
from
my
words
in
any
partickler
,
no
matter
how
*NL*
small
it
is
,
and
your
heart
and
your
liver
shall
be
tore
out
,
roasted
,
*NL*
and
ate
.
Now
,
I
ai
n't
alone
,
as
you
may
think
I
am
.
There
's
a
young
man
*NL*
hid
with
me
,
in
comparison
with
which
young
man
I
am
a
Angel
.
That
young
*NL*
man
hears
the
words
I
speak
.
That
young
man
has
a
secret
way
pecooliar
*NL*
to
himself
,
of
getting
at
a
boy
,
and
at
his
heart
,
and
at
his
liver
.
It
*NL*
is
in
wain
for
a
boy
to
attempt
to
hide
himself
from
that
young
man
.
A
*NL*
boy
may
lock
his
door
,
may
be
warm
in
bed
,
may
tuck
himself
up
,
may
draw
*NL*
the
clothes
over
his
head
,
may
think
himself
comfortable
and
safe
,
but
*NL*
that
young
man
will
softly
creep
and
creep
his
way
to
him
and
tear
him
*NL*
open
.
I
am
a
keeping
that
young
man
from
harming
of
you
at
the
present
*NL*
moment
,
with
great
difficulty
.
I
find
it
wery
hard
to
hold
that
young
*NL*
man
off
of
your
inside
.
Now
,
what
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
that
I
would
get
him
the
file
,
and
I
would
get
him
what
broken
*NL*
bits
of
food
I
could
,
and
I
would
come
to
him
at
the
Battery
,
early
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
Lord
strike
you
dead
if
you
do
n't
!
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
so
,
and
he
took
me
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
you
remember
what
you
've
undertook
,
and
you
remember
*NL*
that
young
man
,
and
you
get
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goo-good
night
,
sir
,
''
I
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
of
that
!
''
said
he
,
glancing
about
him
over
the
cold
wet
flat
.
``
I
*NL*
wish
I
was
a
frog
.
Or
a
eel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
he
hugged
his
shuddering
body
in
both
his
*NL*
arms
,
--
clasping
himself
,
as
if
to
hold
himself
together
,
--
and
limped
*NL*
towards
the
low
church
wall
.
As
I
saw
him
go
,
picking
his
way
among
the
*NL*
nettles
,
and
among
the
brambles
that
bound
the
green
mounds
,
he
looked
*NL*
in
my
young
eyes
as
if
he
were
eluding
the
hands
of
the
dead
people
,
*NL*
stretching
up
cautiously
out
of
their
graves
,
to
get
a
twist
upon
his
*NL*
ankle
and
pull
him
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
to
the
low
church
wall
,
he
got
over
it
,
like
a
man
whose
*NL*
legs
were
numbed
and
stiff
,
and
then
turned
round
to
look
for
me
.
When
I
*NL*
saw
him
turning
,
I
set
my
face
towards
home
,
and
made
the
best
use
of
*NL*
my
legs
.
But
presently
I
looked
over
my
shoulder
,
and
saw
him
going
on
*NL*
again
towards
the
river
,
still
hugging
himself
in
both
arms
,
and
picking
*NL*
his
way
with
his
sore
feet
among
the
great
stones
dropped
into
the
*NL*
marshes
here
and
there
,
for
stepping-places
when
the
rains
were
heavy
or
*NL*
the
tide
was
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marshes
were
just
a
long
black
horizontal
line
then
,
as
I
stopped
*NL*
to
look
after
him
;
and
the
river
was
just
another
horizontal
line
,
not
*NL*
nearly
so
broad
nor
yet
so
black
;
and
the
sky
was
just
a
row
of
long
*NL*
angry
red
lines
and
dense
black
lines
intermixed
.
On
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
river
I
could
faintly
make
out
the
only
two
black
things
in
all
the
*NL*
prospect
that
seemed
to
be
standing
upright
;
one
of
these
was
the
beacon
*NL*
by
which
the
sailors
steered
,
--
like
an
unhooped
cask
upon
a
pole
,
--
an
*NL*
ugly
thing
when
you
were
near
it
;
the
other
,
a
gibbet
,
with
some
chains
*NL*
hanging
to
it
which
had
once
held
a
pirate
.
The
man
was
limping
on
*NL*
towards
this
latter
,
as
if
he
were
the
pirate
come
to
life
,
and
come
*NL*
down
,
and
going
back
to
hook
himself
up
again
.
It
gave
me
a
terrible
*NL*
turn
when
I
thought
so
;
and
as
I
saw
the
cattle
lifting
their
heads
to
*NL*
gaze
after
him
,
I
wondered
whether
they
thought
so
too
.
I
looked
all
*NL*
round
for
the
horrible
young
man
,
and
could
see
no
signs
of
him
.
But
now
*NL*
I
was
frightened
again
,
and

Chapter
II
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
,
Mrs.
Joe
Gargery
,
was
more
than
twenty
years
older
than
I
,
*NL*
and
had
established
a
great
reputation
with
herself
and
the
neighbors
*NL*
because
she
had
brought
me
up
``
by
hand
.
''
Having
at
that
time
to
find
out
*NL*
for
myself
what
the
expression
meant
,
and
knowing
her
to
have
a
hard
and
*NL*
heavy
hand
,
and
to
be
much
in
the
habit
of
laying
it
upon
her
husband
as
*NL*
well
as
upon
me
,
I
supposed
that
Joe
Gargery
and
I
were
both
brought
up
*NL*
by
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
a
good-looking
woman
,
my
sister
;
and
I
had
a
general
*NL*
impression
that
she
must
have
made
Joe
Gargery
marry
her
by
hand
.
Joe
*NL*
was
a
fair
man
,
with
curls
of
flaxen
hair
on
each
side
of
his
smooth
*NL*
face
,
and
with
eyes
of
such
a
very
undecided
blue
that
they
seemed
*NL*
to
have
somehow
got
mixed
with
their
own
whites
.
He
was
a
mild
,
*NL*
good-natured
,
sweet-tempered
,
easy-going
,
foolish
,
dear
fellow
,
--
a
sort
*NL*
of
Hercules
in
strength
,
and
also
in
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
,
Mrs.
Joe
,
with
black
hair
and
eyes
,
had
such
a
prevailing
*NL*
redness
of
skin
that
I
sometimes
used
to
wonder
whether
it
was
possible
*NL*
she
washed
herself
with
a
nutmeg-grater
instead
of
soap
.
She
was
tall
*NL*
and
bony
,
and
almost
always
wore
a
coarse
apron
,
fastened
over
her
*NL*
figure
behind
with
two
loops
,
and
having
a
square
impregnable
bib
in
*NL*
front
,
that
was
stuck
full
of
pins
and
needles
.
She
made
it
a
powerful
*NL*
merit
in
herself
,
and
a
strong
reproach
against
Joe
,
that
she
wore
this
*NL*
apron
so
much
.
Though
I
really
see
no
reason
why
she
should
have
worn
it
*NL*
at
all
;
or
why
,
if
she
did
wear
it
at
all
,
she
should
not
have
taken
it
*NL*
off
,
every
day
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
's
forge
adjoined
our
house
,
which
was
a
wooden
house
,
as
many
of
the
*NL*
dwellings
in
our
country
were
,
--
most
of
them
,
at
that
time
.
When
I
ran
*NL*
home
from
the
churchyard
,
the
forge
was
shut
up
,
and
Joe
was
sitting
*NL*
alone
in
the
kitchen
.
Joe
and
I
being
fellow-sufferers
,
and
having
*NL*
confidences
as
such
,
Joe
imparted
a
confidence
to
me
,
the
moment
I
*NL*
raised
the
latch
of
the
door
and
peeped
in
at
him
opposite
to
it
,
*NL*
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Joe
has
been
out
a
dozen
times
,
looking
for
you
,
Pip
.
And
she
's
*NL*
out
now
,
making
it
a
baker
's
dozen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
;
``
and
what
's
worse
,
she
's
got
Tickler
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
dismal
intelligence
,
I
twisted
the
only
button
on
my
waistcoat
*NL*
round
and
round
,
and
looked
in
great
depression
at
the
fire
.
Tickler
*NL*
was
a
wax-ended
piece
of
cane
,
worn
smooth
by
collision
with
my
tickled
*NL*
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
sot
down
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
and
she
got
up
,
and
she
made
a
grab
at
*NL*
Tickler
,
and
she
Ram-paged
out
.
That
's
what
she
did
,
''
said
Joe
,
slowly
*NL*
clearing
the
fire
between
the
lower
bars
with
the
poker
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
it
;
``
she
Ram-paged
out
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
been
gone
long
,
Joe
?
''
I
always
treated
him
as
a
larger
species
*NL*
of
child
,
and
as
no
more
than
my
equal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Joe
,
glancing
up
at
the
Dutch
clock
,
``
she
's
been
on
the
*NL*
Ram-page
,
this
last
spell
,
about
five
minutes
,
Pip
.
She
's
a
coming
!
Get
*NL*
behind
the
door
,
old
chap
,
and
have
the
jack-towel
betwixt
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
advice
.
My
sister
,
Mrs.
Joe
,
throwing
the
door
wide
open
,
*NL*
and
finding
an
obstruction
behind
it
,
immediately
divined
the
cause
,
and
*NL*
applied
Tickler
to
its
further
investigation
.
She
concluded
by
throwing
*NL*
me
--
I
often
served
as
a
connubial
missile
--
at
Joe
,
who
,
glad
to
get
hold
*NL*
of
me
on
any
terms
,
passed
me
on
into
the
chimney
and
quietly
fenced
me
*NL*
up
there
with
his
great
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
,
you
young
monkey
?
''
said
Mrs.
Joe
,
stamping
her
*NL*
foot
.
``
Tell
me
directly
what
you
've
been
doing
to
wear
me
away
with
fret
*NL*
and
fright
and
worrit
,
or
I
'd
have
you
out
of
that
corner
if
you
was
*NL*
fifty
Pips
,
and
he
was
five
hundred
Gargerys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
been
to
the
churchyard
,
''
said
I
,
from
my
stool
,
crying
and
*NL*
rubbing
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Churchyard
!
''
repeated
my
sister
.
``
If
it
war
n't
for
me
you
'd
have
been
*NL*
to
the
churchyard
long
ago
,
and
stayed
there
.
Who
brought
you
up
by
*NL*
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
I
do
it
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
''
exclaimed
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
whimpered
,
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
!
''
said
my
sister
.
``
I
'd
never
do
it
again
!
I
know
that
.
I
may
*NL*
truly
say
I
've
never
had
this
apron
of
mine
off
since
born
you
were
.
*NL*
It
's
bad
enough
to
be
a
blacksmith
's
wife
-LRB-
and
him
a
Gargery
-RRB-
without
*NL*
being
your
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
thoughts
strayed
from
that
question
as
I
looked
disconsolately
at
*NL*
the
fire
.
For
the
fugitive
out
on
the
marshes
with
the
ironed
leg
,
the
*NL*
mysterious
young
man
,
the
file
,
the
food
,
and
the
dreadful
pledge
I
was
*NL*
under
to
commit
a
larceny
on
those
sheltering
premises
,
rose
before
me
*NL*
in
the
avenging
coals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hah
!
''
said
Mrs.
Joe
,
restoring
Tickler
to
his
station
.
``
Churchyard
,
*NL*
indeed
!
You
may
well
say
churchyard
,
you
two
.
''
One
of
us
,
by
the
by
,
had
*NL*
not
said
it
at
all
.
``
You
'll
drive
me
to
the
churchyard
betwixt
you
,
one
*NL*
of
these
days
,
and
O
,
a
pr-r-recious
pair
you
'd
be
without
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
applied
herself
to
set
the
tea-things
,
Joe
peeped
down
at
me
*NL*
over
his
leg
,
as
if
he
were
mentally
casting
me
and
himself
up
,
and
*NL*
calculating
what
kind
of
pair
we
practically
should
make
,
under
the
*NL*
grievous
circumstances
foreshadowed
.
After
that
,
he
sat
feeling
his
*NL*
right-side
flaxen
curls
and
whisker
,
and
following
Mrs.
Joe
about
with
*NL*
his
blue
eyes
,
as
his
manner
always
was
at
squally
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
had
a
trenchant
way
of
cutting
our
bread
and
butter
for
us
,
*NL*
that
never
varied
.
First
,
with
her
left
hand
she
jammed
the
loaf
hard
*NL*
and
fast
against
her
bib
,
--
where
it
sometimes
got
a
pin
into
it
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
a
needle
,
which
we
afterwards
got
into
our
mouths
.
Then
she
*NL*
took
some
butter
-LRB-
not
too
much
-RRB-
on
a
knife
and
spread
it
on
the
loaf
,
in
*NL*
an
apothecary
kind
of
way
,
as
if
she
were
making
a
plaster
,
--
using
both
*NL*
sides
of
the
knife
with
a
slapping
dexterity
,
and
trimming
and
moulding
*NL*
the
butter
off
round
the
crust
.
Then
,
she
gave
the
knife
a
final
smart
*NL*
wipe
on
the
edge
of
the
plaster
,
and
then
sawed
a
very
thick
round
off
*NL*
the
loaf
:
which
she
finally
,
before
separating
from
the
loaf
,
hewed
into
*NL*
two
halves
,
of
which
Joe
got
one
,
and
I
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
present
occasion
,
though
I
was
hungry
,
I
dared
not
eat
my
*NL*
slice
.
I
felt
that
I
must
have
something
in
reserve
for
my
dreadful
*NL*
acquaintance
,
and
his
ally
the
still
more
dreadful
young
man
.
I
knew
*NL*
Mrs.
Joe
's
housekeeping
to
be
of
the
strictest
kind
,
and
that
my
*NL*
larcenous
researches
might
find
nothing
available
in
the
safe
.
Therefore
*NL*
I
resolved
to
put
my
hunk
of
bread
and
butter
down
the
leg
of
my
*NL*
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effort
of
resolution
necessary
to
the
achievement
of
this
purpose
I
*NL*
found
to
be
quite
awful
.
It
was
as
if
I
had
to
make
up
my
mind
to
leap
*NL*
from
the
top
of
a
high
house
,
or
plunge
into
a
great
depth
of
water
.
*NL*
And
it
was
made
the
more
difficult
by
the
unconscious
Joe
.
In
*NL*
our
already-mentioned
freemasonry
as
fellow-sufferers
,
and
in
his
*NL*
good-natured
companionship
with
me
,
it
was
our
evening
habit
to
compare
*NL*
the
way
we
bit
through
our
slices
,
by
silently
holding
them
up
to
each
*NL*
other
's
admiration
now
and
then
,
--
which
stimulated
us
to
new
exertions
.
*NL*
To-night
,
Joe
several
times
invited
me
,
by
the
display
of
his
fast
*NL*
diminishing
slice
,
to
enter
upon
our
usual
friendly
competition
;
but
*NL*
he
found
me
,
each
time
,
with
my
yellow
mug
of
tea
on
one
knee
,
and
*NL*
my
untouched
bread
and
butter
on
the
other
.
At
last
,
I
desperately
*NL*
considered
that
the
thing
I
contemplated
must
be
done
,
and
that
it
*NL*
had
best
be
done
in
the
least
improbable
manner
consistent
with
the
*NL*
circumstances
.
I
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
Joe
had
just
looked
at
*NL*
me
,
and
got
my
bread
and
butter
down
my
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
was
evidently
made
uncomfortable
by
what
he
supposed
to
be
my
loss
*NL*
of
appetite
,
and
took
a
thoughtful
bite
out
of
his
slice
,
which
he
*NL*
did
n't
seem
to
enjoy
.
He
turned
it
about
in
his
mouth
much
longer
than
*NL*
usual
,
pondering
over
it
a
good
deal
,
and
after
all
gulped
it
down
like
*NL*
a
pill
.
He
was
about
to
take
another
bite
,
and
had
just
got
his
head
on
*NL*
one
side
for
a
good
purchase
on
it
,
when
his
eye
fell
on
me
,
and
he
saw
*NL*
that
my
bread
and
butter
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wonder
and
consternation
with
which
Joe
stopped
on
the
threshold
*NL*
of
his
bite
and
stared
at
me
,
were
too
evident
to
escape
my
sister
's
*NL*
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
now
?
''
said
she
,
smartly
,
as
she
put
down
her
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
you
know
!
''
muttered
Joe
,
shaking
his
head
at
me
in
very
serious
*NL*
remonstrance
.
``
Pip
,
old
chap
!
You
'll
do
yourself
a
mischief
.
It
'll
stick
*NL*
somewhere
.
You
ca
n't
have
chawed
it
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
now
?
''
repeated
my
sister
,
more
sharply
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
can
cough
any
trifle
on
it
up
,
Pip
,
I
'd
recommend
you
to
do
it
,
''
*NL*
said
Joe
,
all
aghast
.
``
Manners
is
manners
,
but
still
your
elth
's
your
*NL*
elth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
,
my
sister
was
quite
desperate
,
so
she
pounced
on
Joe
,
*NL*
and
,
taking
him
by
the
two
whiskers
,
knocked
his
head
for
a
little
while
*NL*
against
the
wall
behind
him
,
while
I
sat
in
the
corner
,
looking
guiltily
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
perhaps
you
'll
mention
what
's
the
matter
,
''
said
my
sister
,
out
of
*NL*
breath
,
``
you
staring
great
stuck
pig
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
looked
at
her
in
a
helpless
way
,
then
took
a
helpless
bite
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
me
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
,
solemnly
,
with
his
last
bite
in
his
cheek
,
*NL*
and
speaking
in
a
confidential
voice
,
as
if
we
two
were
quite
alone
,
*NL*
``
you
and
me
is
always
friends
,
and
I
'd
be
the
last
to
tell
upon
you
,
*NL*
any
time
.
But
such
a
--
''
he
moved
his
chair
and
looked
about
the
floor
*NL*
between
us
,
and
then
again
at
me
--
``
such
a
most
oncommon
Bolt
as
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Been
bolting
his
food
,
has
he
?
''
cried
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
old
chap
,
''
said
Joe
,
looking
at
me
,
and
not
at
Mrs.
Joe
,
*NL*
with
his
bite
still
in
his
cheek
,
``
I
Bolted
,
myself
,
when
I
was
your
*NL*
age
--
frequent
--
and
as
a
boy
I
've
been
among
a
many
Bolters
;
but
I
never
*NL*
see
your
Bolting
equal
yet
,
Pip
,
and
it
's
a
mercy
you
ai
n't
Bolted
*NL*
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
made
a
dive
at
me
,
and
fished
me
up
by
the
hair
,
saying
*NL*
nothing
more
than
the
awful
words
,
``
You
come
along
and
be
dosed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
medical
beast
had
revived
Tar-water
in
those
days
as
a
fine
*NL*
medicine
,
and
Mrs.
Joe
always
kept
a
supply
of
it
in
the
cupboard
;
*NL*
having
a
belief
in
its
virtues
correspondent
to
its
nastiness
.
At
the
*NL*
best
of
times
,
so
much
of
this
elixir
was
administered
to
me
as
a
choice
*NL*
restorative
,
that
I
was
conscious
of
going
about
,
smelling
like
a
new
*NL*
fence
.
On
this
particular
evening
the
urgency
of
my
case
demanded
a
*NL*
pint
of
this
mixture
,
which
was
poured
down
my
throat
,
for
my
greater
*NL*
comfort
,
while
Mrs.
Joe
held
my
head
under
her
arm
,
as
a
boot
would
*NL*
be
held
in
a
bootjack
.
Joe
got
off
with
half
a
pint
;
but
was
made
to
*NL*
swallow
that
-LRB-
much
to
his
disturbance
,
as
he
sat
slowly
munching
and
*NL*
meditating
before
the
fire
-RRB-
,
``
because
he
had
had
a
turn
.
''
Judging
from
*NL*
myself
,
I
should
say
he
certainly
had
a
turn
afterwards
,
if
he
had
had
*NL*
none
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Conscience
is
a
dreadful
thing
when
it
accuses
man
or
boy
;
but
when
,
in
*NL*
the
case
of
a
boy
,
that
secret
burden
co-operates
with
another
secret
*NL*
burden
down
the
leg
of
his
trousers
,
it
is
-LRB-
as
I
can
testify
-RRB-
a
great
*NL*
punishment
.
The
guilty
knowledge
that
I
was
going
to
rob
Mrs.
Joe
--
I
*NL*
never
thought
I
was
going
to
rob
Joe
,
for
I
never
thought
of
any
of
the
*NL*
housekeeping
property
as
his
--
united
to
the
necessity
of
always
keeping
*NL*
one
hand
on
my
bread
and
butter
as
I
sat
,
or
when
I
was
ordered
about
*NL*
the
kitchen
on
any
small
errand
,
almost
drove
me
out
of
my
mind
.
Then
,
*NL*
as
the
marsh
winds
made
the
fire
glow
and
flare
,
I
thought
I
heard
the
*NL*
voice
outside
,
of
the
man
with
the
iron
on
his
leg
who
had
sworn
me
to
*NL*
secrecy
,
declaring
that
he
could
n't
and
would
n't
starve
until
to-morrow
,
*NL*
but
must
be
fed
now
.
At
other
times
,
I
thought
,
What
if
the
young
man
*NL*
who
was
with
so
much
difficulty
restrained
from
imbruing
his
hands
in
me
*NL*
should
yield
to
a
constitutional
impatience
,
or
should
mistake
the
time
,
*NL*
and
should
think
himself
accredited
to
my
heart
and
liver
to-night
,
*NL*
instead
of
to-morrow
!
If
ever
anybody
's
hair
stood
on
end
with
terror
,
*NL*
mine
must
have
done
so
then
.
But
,
perhaps
,
nobody
's
ever
did
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Christmas
Eve
,
and
I
had
to
stir
the
pudding
for
next
day
,
with
*NL*
a
copper-stick
,
from
seven
to
eight
by
the
Dutch
clock
.
I
tried
it
with
*NL*
the
load
upon
my
leg
-LRB-
and
that
made
me
think
afresh
of
the
man
with
the
*NL*
load
on
HIS
leg
-RRB-
,
and
found
the
tendency
of
exercise
to
bring
the
bread
*NL*
and
butter
out
at
my
ankle
,
quite
unmanageable
.
Happily
I
slipped
away
,
*NL*
and
deposited
that
part
of
my
conscience
in
my
garret
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
!
''
said
I
,
when
I
had
done
my
stirring
,
and
was
taking
a
final
warm
*NL*
in
the
chimney
corner
before
being
sent
up
to
bed
;
``
was
that
great
guns
,
*NL*
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Joe
.
``
There
's
another
conwict
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
mean
,
Joe
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Joe
,
who
always
took
explanations
upon
herself
,
said
,
snappishly
,
*NL*
``
Escaped
.
Escaped
.
''
Administering
the
definition
like
Tar-water
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Mrs.
Joe
sat
with
her
head
bending
over
her
needlework
,
I
put
my
*NL*
mouth
into
the
forms
of
saying
to
Joe
,
``
What
's
a
convict
?
''
Joe
put
his
*NL*
mouth
into
the
forms
of
returning
such
a
highly
elaborate
answer
,
that
I
*NL*
could
make
out
nothing
of
it
but
the
single
word
``
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
conwict
off
last
night
,
''
said
Joe
,
aloud
,
``
after
*NL*
sunset-gun
.
And
they
fired
warning
of
him
.
And
now
it
appears
they
're
*NL*
firing
warning
of
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
firing
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drat
that
boy
,
''
interposed
my
sister
,
frowning
at
me
over
her
work
,
*NL*
``
what
a
questioner
he
is
.
Ask
no
questions
,
and
you
'll
be
told
no
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
very
polite
to
herself
,
I
thought
,
to
imply
that
I
should
be
*NL*
told
lies
by
her
even
if
I
did
ask
questions
.
But
she
never
was
polite
*NL*
unless
there
was
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
Joe
greatly
augmented
my
curiosity
by
taking
the
utmost
*NL*
pains
to
open
his
mouth
very
wide
,
and
to
put
it
into
the
form
of
a
word
*NL*
that
looked
to
me
like
``
sulks
.
''
Therefore
,
I
naturally
pointed
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Joe
,
and
put
my
mouth
into
the
form
of
saying
,
``
her
?
''
But
Joe
would
n't
*NL*
hear
of
that
,
at
all
,
and
again
opened
his
mouth
very
wide
,
and
shook
*NL*
the
form
of
a
most
emphatic
word
out
of
it
.
But
I
could
make
nothing
of
*NL*
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Joe
,
''
said
I
,
as
a
last
resort
,
``
I
should
like
to
know
--
if
you
*NL*
would
n't
much
mind
--
where
the
firing
comes
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bless
the
boy
!
''
exclaimed
my
sister
,
as
if
she
did
n't
quite
mean
*NL*
that
but
rather
the
contrary
.
``
From
the
Hulks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh-h
!
''
said
I
,
looking
at
Joe
.
``
Hulks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
gave
a
reproachful
cough
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
Well
,
I
told
you
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
please
,
what
's
Hulks
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
with
this
boy
!
''
exclaimed
my
sister
,
pointing
me
out
*NL*
with
her
needle
and
thread
,
and
shaking
her
head
at
me
.
``
Answer
him
one
*NL*
question
,
and
he
'll
ask
you
a
dozen
directly
.
Hulks
are
prison-ships
,
*NL*
right
`
cross
th
'
meshes
.
''
We
always
used
that
name
for
marshes
,
in
our
*NL*
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
who
's
put
into
prison-ships
,
and
why
they
're
put
there
?
''
said
*NL*
I
,
in
a
general
way
,
and
with
quiet
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
much
for
Mrs.
Joe
,
who
immediately
rose
.
``
I
tell
you
what
,
*NL*
young
fellow
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
did
n't
bring
you
up
by
hand
to
badger
*NL*
people
's
lives
out
.
It
would
be
blame
to
me
and
not
praise
,
if
I
had
.
*NL*
People
are
put
in
the
Hulks
because
they
murder
,
and
because
they
rob
,
*NL*
and
forge
,
and
do
all
sorts
of
bad
;
and
they
always
begin
by
asking
*NL*
questions
.
Now
,
you
get
along
to
bed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
never
allowed
a
candle
to
light
me
to
bed
,
and
,
as
I
went
upstairs
*NL*
in
the
dark
,
with
my
head
tingling
,
--
from
Mrs.
Joe
's
thimble
*NL*
having
played
the
tambourine
upon
it
,
to
accompany
her
last
words
,
--
I
*NL*
felt
fearfully
sensible
of
the
great
convenience
that
the
hulks
were
*NL*
handy
for
me
.
I
was
clearly
on
my
way
there
.
I
had
begun
by
asking
*NL*
questions
,
and
I
was
going
to
rob
Mrs.
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
that
time
,
which
is
far
enough
away
now
,
I
have
often
thought
*NL*
that
few
people
know
what
secrecy
there
is
in
the
young
under
terror
.
*NL*
No
matter
how
unreasonable
the
terror
,
so
that
it
be
terror
.
I
was
in
*NL*
mortal
terror
of
the
young
man
who
wanted
my
heart
and
liver
;
I
was
*NL*
in
mortal
terror
of
my
interlocutor
with
the
iron
leg
;
I
was
in
mortal
*NL*
terror
of
myself
,
from
whom
an
awful
promise
had
been
extracted
;
I
had
*NL*
no
hope
of
deliverance
through
my
all-powerful
sister
,
who
repulsed
*NL*
me
at
every
turn
;
I
am
afraid
to
think
of
what
I
might
have
done
on
*NL*
requirement
,
in
the
secrecy
of
my
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
slept
at
all
that
night
,
it
was
only
to
imagine
myself
drifting
*NL*
down
the
river
on
a
strong
spring-tide
,
to
the
Hulks
;
a
ghostly
*NL*
pirate
calling
out
to
me
through
a
speaking-trumpet
,
as
I
passed
the
*NL*
gibbet-station
,
that
I
had
better
come
ashore
and
be
hanged
there
at
*NL*
once
,
and
not
put
it
off
.
I
was
afraid
to
sleep
,
even
if
I
had
been
*NL*
inclined
,
for
I
knew
that
at
the
first
faint
dawn
of
morning
I
must
rob
*NL*
the
pantry
.
There
was
no
doing
it
in
the
night
,
for
there
was
no
getting
*NL*
a
light
by
easy
friction
then
;
to
have
got
one
I
must
have
struck
it
out
*NL*
of
flint
and
steel
,
and
have
made
a
noise
like
the
very
pirate
himself
*NL*
rattling
his
chains
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
great
black
velvet
pall
outside
my
little
window
was
shot
*NL*
with
gray
,
I
got
up
and
went
downstairs
;
every
board
upon
the
way
,
and
*NL*
every
crack
in
every
board
calling
after
me
,
``
Stop
thief
!
''
and
``
Get
up
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Joe
!
''
In
the
pantry
,
which
was
far
more
abundantly
supplied
than
*NL*
usual
,
owing
to
the
season
,
I
was
very
much
alarmed
by
a
hare
hanging
*NL*
up
by
the
heels
,
whom
I
rather
thought
I
caught
,
when
my
back
was
half
*NL*
turned
,
winking
.
I
had
no
time
for
verification
,
no
time
for
selection
,
*NL*
no
time
for
anything
,
for
I
had
no
time
to
spare
.
I
stole
some
bread
,
*NL*
some
rind
of
cheese
,
about
half
a
jar
of
mincemeat
-LRB-
which
I
tied
up
in
*NL*
my
pocket-handkerchief
with
my
last
night
's
slice
-RRB-
,
some
brandy
from
a
*NL*
stone
bottle
-LRB-
which
I
decanted
into
a
glass
bottle
I
had
secretly
used
*NL*
for
making
that
intoxicating
fluid
,
Spanish-liquorice-water
,
up
in
my
*NL*
room
:
diluting
the
stone
bottle
from
a
jug
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
-RRB-
,
*NL*
a
meat
bone
with
very
little
on
it
,
and
a
beautiful
round
compact
pork
*NL*
pie
.
I
was
nearly
going
away
without
the
pie
,
but
I
was
tempted
to
mount
*NL*
upon
a
shelf
,
to
look
what
it
was
that
was
put
away
so
carefully
in
a
*NL*
covered
earthenware
dish
in
a
corner
,
and
I
found
it
was
the
pie
,
and
*NL*
I
took
it
in
the
hope
that
it
was
not
intended
for
early
use
,
and
would
*NL*
not
be
missed
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
door
in
the
kitchen
,
communicating
with
the
forge
;
I
*NL*
unlocked
and
unbolted
that
door
,
and
got
a
file
from
among
Joe
's
tools
.
*NL*
Then
I
put
the
fastenings
as
I
had
found
them
,
opened
the
door
at
which
*NL*
I
had
entered
when
I
ran
home
last
night
,
shut
it
,
and
ran
for
the
misty
*NL*
marshes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
III
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
rimy
morning
,
and
very
damp
.
I
had
seen
the
damp
lying
on
the
*NL*
outside
of
my
little
window
,
as
if
some
goblin
had
been
crying
there
all
*NL*
night
,
and
using
the
window
for
a
pocket-handkerchief
.
Now
,
I
saw
the
*NL*
damp
lying
on
the
bare
hedges
and
spare
grass
,
like
a
coarser
sort
of
*NL*
spiders
'
webs
;
hanging
itself
from
twig
to
twig
and
blade
to
blade
.
On
*NL*
every
rail
and
gate
,
wet
lay
clammy
,
and
the
marsh
mist
was
so
thick
,
*NL*
that
the
wooden
finger
on
the
post
directing
people
to
our
village
--
a
*NL*
direction
which
they
never
accepted
,
for
they
never
came
there
--
was
*NL*
invisible
to
me
until
I
was
quite
close
under
it
.
Then
,
as
I
looked
up
*NL*
at
it
,
while
it
dripped
,
it
seemed
to
my
oppressed
conscience
like
a
*NL*
phantom
devoting
me
to
the
Hulks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mist
was
heavier
yet
when
I
got
out
upon
the
marshes
,
so
that
*NL*
instead
of
my
running
at
everything
,
everything
seemed
to
run
at
me
.
*NL*
This
was
very
disagreeable
to
a
guilty
mind
.
The
gates
and
dikes
and
*NL*
banks
came
bursting
at
me
through
the
mist
,
as
if
they
cried
as
plainly
*NL*
as
could
be
,
``
A
boy
with
somebody
else
's
pork
pie
!
Stop
him
!
''
The
*NL*
cattle
came
upon
me
with
like
suddenness
,
staring
out
of
their
eyes
,
*NL*
and
steaming
out
of
their
nostrils
,
``
Halloa
,
young
thief
!
''
One
black
*NL*
ox
,
with
a
white
cravat
on
,
--
who
even
had
to
my
awakened
conscience
*NL*
something
of
a
clerical
air
,
--
fixed
me
so
obstinately
with
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
moved
his
blunt
head
round
in
such
an
accusatory
manner
as
I
moved
*NL*
round
,
that
I
blubbered
out
to
him
,
``
I
could
n't
help
it
,
sir
!
It
was
n't
*NL*
for
myself
I
took
it
!
''
Upon
which
he
put
down
his
head
,
blew
a
cloud
of
*NL*
smoke
out
of
his
nose
,
and
vanished
with
a
kick-up
of
his
hind-legs
and
*NL*
a
flourish
of
his
tail
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
,
I
was
getting
on
towards
the
river
;
but
however
fast
I
*NL*
went
,
I
could
n't
warm
my
feet
,
to
which
the
damp
cold
seemed
riveted
,
as
*NL*
the
iron
was
riveted
to
the
leg
of
the
man
I
was
running
to
meet
.
I
knew
*NL*
my
way
to
the
Battery
,
pretty
straight
,
for
I
had
been
down
there
on
a
*NL*
Sunday
with
Joe
,
and
Joe
,
sitting
on
an
old
gun
,
had
told
me
that
when
*NL*
I
was
`
prentice
to
him
,
regularly
bound
,
we
would
have
such
Larks
there
!
*NL*
However
,
in
the
confusion
of
the
mist
,
I
found
myself
at
last
too
far
to
*NL*
the
right
,
and
consequently
had
to
try
back
along
the
river-side
,
on
the
*NL*
bank
of
loose
stones
above
the
mud
and
the
stakes
that
staked
the
tide
*NL*
out
.
Making
my
way
along
here
with
all
despatch
,
I
had
just
crossed
a
*NL*
ditch
which
I
knew
to
be
very
near
the
Battery
,
and
had
just
scrambled
*NL*
up
the
mound
beyond
the
ditch
,
when
I
saw
the
man
sitting
before
me
.
*NL*
His
back
was
towards
me
,
and
he
had
his
arms
folded
,
and
was
nodding
*NL*
forward
,
heavy
with
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
he
would
be
more
glad
if
I
came
upon
him
with
his
breakfast
,
*NL*
in
that
unexpected
manner
,
so
I
went
forward
softly
and
touched
him
on
*NL*
the
shoulder
.
He
instantly
jumped
up
,
and
it
was
not
the
same
man
,
but
*NL*
another
man
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
this
man
was
dressed
in
coarse
gray
,
too
,
and
had
a
great
iron
*NL*
on
his
leg
,
and
was
lame
,
and
hoarse
,
and
cold
,
and
was
everything
that
*NL*
the
other
man
was
;
except
that
he
had
not
the
same
face
,
and
had
a
flat
*NL*
broad-brimmed
low-crowned
felt
hat
on
.
All
this
I
saw
in
a
moment
,
for
*NL*
I
had
only
a
moment
to
see
it
in
:
he
swore
an
oath
at
me
,
made
a
hit
at
*NL*
me
,
--
it
was
a
round
weak
blow
that
missed
me
and
almost
knocked
himself
*NL*
down
,
for
it
made
him
stumble
,
--
and
then
he
ran
into
the
mist
,
stumbling
*NL*
twice
as
he
went
,
and
I
lost
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
young
man
!
''
I
thought
,
feeling
my
heart
shoot
as
I
identified
*NL*
him
.
I
dare
say
I
should
have
felt
a
pain
in
my
liver
,
too
,
if
I
had
*NL*
known
where
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
soon
at
the
Battery
after
that
,
and
there
was
the
right
*NL*
man
,
--
hugging
himself
and
limping
to
and
fro
,
as
if
he
had
never
all
*NL*
night
left
off
hugging
and
limping
,
--
waiting
for
me
.
He
was
awfully
*NL*
cold
,
to
be
sure
.
I
half
expected
to
see
him
drop
down
before
my
face
*NL*
and
die
of
deadly
cold
.
His
eyes
looked
so
awfully
hungry
too
,
that
when
*NL*
I
handed
him
the
file
and
he
laid
it
down
on
the
grass
,
it
occurred
to
*NL*
me
he
would
have
tried
to
eat
it
,
if
he
had
not
seen
my
bundle
.
He
did
*NL*
not
turn
me
upside
down
this
time
to
get
at
what
I
had
,
but
left
me
*NL*
right
side
upwards
while
I
opened
the
bundle
and
emptied
my
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
in
the
bottle
,
boy
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brandy
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
already
handing
mincemeat
down
his
throat
in
the
most
curious
*NL*
manner
,
--
more
like
a
man
who
was
putting
it
away
somewhere
in
a
violent
*NL*
hurry
,
than
a
man
who
was
eating
it
,
--
but
he
left
off
to
take
some
of
*NL*
the
liquor
.
He
shivered
all
the
while
so
violently
,
that
it
was
quite
*NL*
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
keep
the
neck
of
the
bottle
between
his
teeth
,
*NL*
without
biting
it
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
have
got
the
ague
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
much
of
your
opinion
,
boy
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
bad
about
here
,
''
I
told
him
.
``
You
've
been
lying
out
on
the
meshes
,
*NL*
and
they
're
dreadful
aguish
.
Rheumatic
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
eat
my
breakfast
afore
they
're
the
death
of
me
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
'd
do
*NL*
that
,
if
I
was
going
to
be
strung
up
to
that
there
gallows
as
there
is
*NL*
over
there
,
directly
afterwards
.
I
'll
beat
the
shivers
so
far
,
I
'll
bet
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
gobbling
mincemeat
,
meatbone
,
bread
,
cheese
,
and
pork
pie
,
all
*NL*
at
once
:
staring
distrustfully
while
he
did
so
at
the
mist
all
round
*NL*
us
,
and
often
stopping
--
even
stopping
his
jaws
--
to
listen
.
Some
real
or
*NL*
fancied
sound
,
some
clink
upon
the
river
or
breathing
of
beast
upon
the
*NL*
marsh
,
now
gave
him
a
start
,
and
he
said
,
suddenly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
a
deceiving
imp
?
You
brought
no
one
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
!
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
giv
'
no
one
the
office
to
follow
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
believe
you
.
You
'd
be
but
a
fierce
young
hound
*NL*
indeed
,
if
at
your
time
of
life
you
could
help
to
hunt
a
wretched
*NL*
warmint
hunted
as
near
death
and
dunghill
as
this
poor
wretched
warmint
*NL*
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
clicked
in
his
throat
as
if
he
had
works
in
him
like
a
clock
,
*NL*
and
was
going
to
strike
.
And
he
smeared
his
ragged
rough
sleeve
over
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pitying
his
desolation
,
and
watching
him
as
he
gradually
settled
down
*NL*
upon
the
pie
,
I
made
bold
to
say
,
``
I
am
glad
you
enjoy
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
I
was
glad
you
enjoyed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
,
my
boy
.
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
often
watched
a
large
dog
of
ours
eating
his
food
;
and
I
now
*NL*
noticed
a
decided
similarity
between
the
dog
's
way
of
eating
,
and
the
*NL*
man
's
.
The
man
took
strong
sharp
sudden
bites
,
just
like
the
dog
.
He
*NL*
swallowed
,
or
rather
snapped
up
,
every
mouthful
,
too
soon
and
too
fast
;
*NL*
and
he
looked
sideways
here
and
there
while
he
ate
,
as
if
he
thought
*NL*
there
was
danger
in
every
direction
of
somebody
's
coming
to
take
the
pie
*NL*
away
.
He
was
altogether
too
unsettled
in
his
mind
over
it
,
to
appreciate
*NL*
it
comfortably
I
thought
,
or
to
have
anybody
to
dine
with
him
,
without
*NL*
making
a
chop
with
his
jaws
at
the
visitor
.
In
all
of
which
particulars
*NL*
he
was
very
like
the
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
you
wo
n't
leave
any
of
it
for
him
,
''
said
I
,
timidly
;
after
*NL*
a
silence
during
which
I
had
hesitated
as
to
the
politeness
of
making
*NL*
the
remark
.
``
There
's
no
more
to
be
got
where
that
came
from
.
''
It
was
the
*NL*
certainty
of
this
fact
that
impelled
me
to
offer
the
hint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
any
for
him
?
Who
's
him
?
''
said
my
friend
,
stopping
in
his
*NL*
crunching
of
pie-crust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
man
.
That
you
spoke
of
.
That
was
hid
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
ah
!
''
he
returned
,
with
something
like
a
gruff
laugh
.
``
Him
?
Yes
,
yes
!
*NL*
He
do
n't
want
no
wittles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
he
looked
as
if
he
did
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
stopped
eating
,
and
regarded
me
with
the
keenest
scrutiny
and
*NL*
the
greatest
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looked
?
When
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yonder
,
''
said
I
,
pointing
;
``
over
there
,
where
I
found
him
nodding
*NL*
asleep
,
and
thought
it
was
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
me
by
the
collar
and
stared
at
me
so
,
that
I
began
to
think
his
*NL*
first
idea
about
cutting
my
throat
had
revived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dressed
like
you
,
you
know
,
only
with
a
hat
,
''
I
explained
,
trembling
;
*NL*
``
and
--
and
''
--
I
was
very
anxious
to
put
this
delicately
--
``
and
with
--
the
*NL*
same
reason
for
wanting
to
borrow
a
file
.
Did
n't
you
hear
the
cannon
*NL*
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
was
firing
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
you
should
n't
have
been
sure
of
that
,
''
I
returned
,
``
for
*NL*
we
heard
it
up
at
home
,
and
that
's
farther
away
,
and
we
were
shut
in
*NL*
besides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
see
now
!
''
said
he
.
``
When
a
man
's
alone
on
these
flats
,
with
a
*NL*
light
head
and
a
light
stomach
,
perishing
of
cold
and
want
,
he
hears
*NL*
nothin
'
all
night
,
but
guns
firing
,
and
voices
calling
.
Hears
?
He
sees
*NL*
the
soldiers
,
with
their
red
coats
lighted
up
by
the
torches
carried
*NL*
afore
,
closing
in
round
him
.
Hears
his
number
called
,
hears
himself
*NL*
challenged
,
hears
the
rattle
of
the
muskets

hears
the
orders

Make
*NL*
ready

Present

Cover
him
steady
,
men

and
is
laid
hands
on

and
*NL*
there
's
nothin

Why

if
I
see
one
pursuing
party
last
night

coming
up
*NL*
in
order

Damn
'em
,
with
their
tramp

tramp

I
see
a
hundred

And
as
to
*NL*
firing
!
Why
,
I
see
the
mist
shake
with
the
cannon
,
arter
it
was
broad
*NL*
day
,
--
But
this
man
''
;
he
had
said
all
the
rest
,
as
if
he
had
forgotten
my
*NL*
being
there
;
``
did
you
notice
anything
in
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
a
badly
bruised
face
,
''
said
I
,
recalling
what
I
hardly
knew
I
*NL*
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
here
?
''
exclaimed
the
man
,
striking
his
left
cheek
mercilessly
,
with
*NL*
the
flat
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
He
crammed
what
little
food
was
left
,
into
the
breast
of
*NL*
his
gray
jacket
.
``
Show
me
the
way
he
went
.
I
'll
pull
him
down
,
like
a
*NL*
bloodhound
.
Curse
this
iron
on
my
sore
leg
!
Give
us
hold
of
the
file
,
*NL*
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
indicated
in
what
direction
the
mist
had
shrouded
the
other
man
,
*NL*
and
he
looked
up
at
it
for
an
instant
.
But
he
was
down
on
the
rank
wet
*NL*
grass
,
filing
at
his
iron
like
a
madman
,
and
not
minding
me
or
minding
*NL*
his
own
leg
,
which
had
an
old
chafe
upon
it
and
was
bloody
,
but
which
he
*NL*
handled
as
roughly
as
if
it
had
no
more
feeling
in
it
than
the
file
.
I
*NL*
was
very
much
afraid
of
him
again
,
now
that
he
had
worked
himself
into
*NL*
this
fierce
hurry
,
and
I
was
likewise
very
much
afraid
of
keeping
away
*NL*
from
home
any
longer
.
I
told
him
I
must
go
,
but
he
took
no
notice
,
so
*NL*
I
thought
the
best
thing
I
could
do
was
to
slip
off
.
The
last
I
saw
*NL*
of
him
,
his
head
was
bent
over
his
knee
and
he
was
working
hard
at
his
*NL*
fetter
,
muttering
impatient
imprecations
at
it
and
at
his
leg
.
The
last
*NL*
I
heard
of
him
,
I
stopped
in
the
mist
to
listen
,
and
the
file
was
still
*NL*
going
.

Chapter
IV
*NL*
*NL*
I
fully
expected
to
find
a
Constable
in
the
kitchen
,
waiting
to
take
me
*NL*
up
.
But
not
only
was
there
no
Constable
there
,
but
no
discovery
had
yet
*NL*
been
made
of
the
robbery
.
Mrs.
Joe
was
prodigiously
busy
in
getting
the
*NL*
house
ready
for
the
festivities
of
the
day
,
and
Joe
had
been
put
upon
*NL*
the
kitchen
doorstep
to
keep
him
out
of
the
dust-pan
,
--
an
article
into
*NL*
which
his
destiny
always
led
him
,
sooner
or
later
,
when
my
sister
was
*NL*
vigorously
reaping
the
floors
of
her
establishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
the
deuce
ha
'
you
been
?
''
was
Mrs.
Joe
's
Christmas
salutation
,
*NL*
when
I
and
my
conscience
showed
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
had
been
down
to
hear
the
Carols
.
``
Ah
!
well
!
''
observed
Mrs.
*NL*
Joe
.
``
You
might
ha
'
done
worse
.
''
Not
a
doubt
of
that
I
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
if
I
war
n't
a
blacksmith
's
wife
,
and
-LRB-
what
's
the
same
thing
-RRB-
a
*NL*
slave
with
her
apron
never
off
,
I
should
have
been
to
hear
the
Carols
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Joe
.
``
I
'm
rather
partial
to
Carols
,
myself
,
and
that
's
the
*NL*
best
of
reasons
for
my
never
hearing
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
,
who
had
ventured
into
the
kitchen
after
me
as
the
dustpan
had
*NL*
retired
before
us
,
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
nose
with
a
*NL*
conciliatory
air
,
when
Mrs.
Joe
darted
a
look
at
him
,
and
,
when
her
eyes
*NL*
were
withdrawn
,
secretly
crossed
his
two
forefingers
,
and
exhibited
them
*NL*
to
me
,
as
our
token
that
Mrs.
Joe
was
in
a
cross
temper
.
This
was
so
*NL*
much
her
normal
state
,
that
Joe
and
I
would
often
,
for
weeks
together
,
*NL*
be
,
as
to
our
fingers
,
like
monumental
Crusaders
as
to
their
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
to
have
a
superb
dinner
,
consisting
of
a
leg
of
pickled
pork
and
*NL*
greens
,
and
a
pair
of
roast
stuffed
fowls
.
A
handsome
mince-pie
had
*NL*
been
made
yesterday
morning
-LRB-
which
accounted
for
the
mincemeat
not
*NL*
being
missed
-RRB-
,
and
the
pudding
was
already
on
the
boil
.
These
extensive
*NL*
arrangements
occasioned
us
to
be
cut
off
unceremoniously
in
respect
of
*NL*
breakfast
;
``
for
I
ai
n't
,
''
said
Mrs.
Joe
,
--
``
I
ai
n't
a
going
to
have
*NL*
no
formal
cramming
and
busting
and
washing
up
now
,
with
what
I
've
got
*NL*
before
me
,
I
promise
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
we
had
our
slices
served
out
,
as
if
we
were
two
thousand
troops
on
a
*NL*
forced
march
instead
of
a
man
and
boy
at
home
;
and
we
took
gulps
of
milk
*NL*
and
water
,
with
apologetic
countenances
,
from
a
jug
on
the
dresser
.
In
*NL*
the
meantime
,
Mrs.
Joe
put
clean
white
curtains
up
,
and
tacked
a
new
*NL*
flowered
flounce
across
the
wide
chimney
to
replace
the
old
one
,
and
*NL*
uncovered
the
little
state
parlor
across
the
passage
,
which
was
never
*NL*
uncovered
at
any
other
time
,
but
passed
the
rest
of
the
year
in
a
cool
*NL*
haze
of
silver
paper
,
which
even
extended
to
the
four
little
white
*NL*
crockery
poodles
on
the
mantel-shelf
,
each
with
a
black
nose
and
a
*NL*
basket
of
flowers
in
his
mouth
,
and
each
the
counterpart
of
the
other
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Joe
was
a
very
clean
housekeeper
,
but
had
an
exquisite
art
of
*NL*
making
her
cleanliness
more
uncomfortable
and
unacceptable
than
dirt
*NL*
itself
.
Cleanliness
is
next
to
Godliness
,
and
some
people
do
the
same
by
*NL*
their
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
,
having
so
much
to
do
,
was
going
to
church
vicariously
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
Joe
and
I
were
going
.
In
his
working
-
*NL*
well-knit
characteristic-looking
blacksmith
;
in
his
holiday
clothes
,
*NL*
he
was
more
like
a
scarecrow
in
good
circumstances
,
than
anything
else
.
*NL*
Nothing
that
he
wore
then
fitted
him
or
seemed
to
belong
to
him
;
and
*NL*
everything
that
he
wore
then
grazed
him
.
On
the
present
festive
occasion
*NL*
he
emerged
from
his
room
,
when
the
blithe
bells
were
going
,
the
picture
*NL*
of
misery
,
in
a
full
suit
of
Sunday
penitentials
.
As
to
me
,
I
think
my
*NL*
sister
must
have
had
some
general
idea
that
I
was
a
young
offender
whom
*NL*
an
Accoucheur
Policeman
had
taken
up
-LRB-
on
my
birthday
-RRB-
and
delivered
over
*NL*
to
her
,
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
the
outraged
majesty
of
the
law
.
*NL*
I
was
always
treated
as
if
I
had
insisted
on
being
born
in
opposition
*NL*
to
the
dictates
of
reason
,
religion
,
and
morality
,
and
against
the
*NL*
dissuading
arguments
of
my
best
friends
.
Even
when
I
was
taken
to
have
*NL*
a
new
suit
of
clothes
,
the
tailor
had
orders
to
make
them
like
a
kind
of
*NL*
Reformatory
,
and
on
no
account
to
let
me
have
the
free
use
of
my
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
and
I
going
to
church
,
therefore
,
must
have
been
a
moving
spectacle
*NL*
for
compassionate
minds
.
Yet
,
what
I
suffered
outside
was
nothing
to
*NL*
what
I
underwent
within
.
The
terrors
that
had
assailed
me
whenever
*NL*
Mrs.
Joe
had
gone
near
the
pantry
,
or
out
of
the
room
,
were
only
to
be
*NL*
equalled
by
the
remorse
with
which
my
mind
dwelt
on
what
my
hands
had
*NL*
done
.
Under
the
weight
of
my
wicked
secret
,
I
pondered
whether
the
*NL*
Church
would
be
powerful
enough
to
shield
me
from
the
vengeance
of
the
*NL*
terrible
young
man
,
if
I
divulged
to
that
establishment
.
I
conceived
the
*NL*
idea
that
the
time
when
the
banns
were
read
and
when
the
clergyman
said
,
*NL*
``
Ye
are
now
to
declare
it
!
''
would
be
the
time
for
me
to
rise
and
propose
*NL*
a
private
conference
in
the
vestry
.
I
am
far
from
being
sure
that
I
*NL*
might
not
have
astonished
our
small
congregation
by
resorting
to
this
*NL*
extreme
measure
,
but
for
its
being
Christmas
Day
and
no
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
,
the
clerk
at
church
,
was
to
dine
with
us
;
and
Mr.
Hubble
*NL*
the
wheelwright
and
Mrs.
Hubble
;
and
Uncle
Pumblechook
-LRB-
Joe
's
uncle
,
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Joe
appropriated
him
-RRB-
,
who
was
a
well-to-do
cornchandler
in
*NL*
the
nearest
town
,
and
drove
his
own
chaise-cart
.
The
dinner
hour
was
*NL*
half-past
one
.
When
Joe
and
I
got
home
,
we
found
the
table
laid
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Joe
dressed
,
and
the
dinner
dressing
,
and
the
front
door
unlocked
*NL*
-LRB-
it
never
was
at
any
other
time
-RRB-
for
the
company
to
enter
by
,
and
*NL*
everything
most
splendid
.
And
still
,
not
a
word
of
the
robbery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
came
,
without
bringing
with
it
any
relief
to
my
feelings
,
and
*NL*
the
company
came
.
Mr.
Wopsle
,
united
to
a
Roman
nose
and
a
large
shining
*NL*
bald
forehead
,
had
a
deep
voice
which
he
was
uncommonly
proud
of
;
indeed
*NL*
it
was
understood
among
his
acquaintance
that
if
you
could
only
give
him
*NL*
his
head
,
he
would
read
the
clergyman
into
fits
;
he
himself
confessed
*NL*
that
if
the
Church
was
``
thrown
open
,
''
meaning
to
competition
,
he
would
*NL*
not
despair
of
making
his
mark
in
it
.
The
Church
not
being
``
thrown
*NL*
open
,
''
he
was
,
as
I
have
said
,
our
clerk
.
But
he
punished
the
Amens
*NL*
tremendously
;
and
when
he
gave
out
the
psalm
,
--
always
giving
the
whole
*NL*
verse
,
--
he
looked
all
round
the
congregation
first
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
*NL*
``
You
have
heard
my
friend
overhead
;
oblige
me
with
your
opinion
of
this
*NL*
style
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
opened
the
door
to
the
company
,
--
making
believe
that
it
was
a
habit
*NL*
of
ours
to
open
that
door
,
--
and
I
opened
it
first
to
Mr.
Wopsle
,
next
*NL*
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hubble
,
and
last
of
all
to
Uncle
Pumblechook
.
N.B.
I
was
*NL*
not
allowed
to
call
him
uncle
,
under
the
severest
penalties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Joe
,
''
said
Uncle
Pumblechook
,
a
large
hard-breathing
middle-aged
*NL*
slow
man
,
with
a
mouth
like
a
fish
,
dull
staring
eyes
,
and
sandy
hair
*NL*
standing
upright
on
his
head
,
so
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
just
been
*NL*
all
but
choked
,
and
had
that
moment
come
to
,
``
I
have
brought
you
as
the
*NL*
compliments
of
the
season
--
I
have
brought
you
,
Mum
,
a
bottle
of
sherry
*NL*
wine
--
and
I
have
brought
you
,
Mum
,
a
bottle
of
port
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
Christmas
Day
he
presented
himself
,
as
a
profound
novelty
,
with
*NL*
exactly
the
same
words
,
and
carrying
the
two
bottles
like
dumb-bells
.
*NL*
Every
Christmas
Day
,
Mrs.
Joe
replied
,
as
she
now
replied
,
``
O
,
Un
--
cle
*NL*
Pum-ble
--
chook
!
This
is
kind
!
''
Every
Christmas
Day
,
he
retorted
,
as
*NL*
he
now
retorted
,
``
It
's
no
more
than
your
merits
.
And
now
are
you
all
*NL*
bobbish
,
and
how
's
Sixpennorth
of
halfpence
?
''
meaning
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
dined
on
these
occasions
in
the
kitchen
,
and
adjourned
,
for
the
nuts
*NL*
and
oranges
and
apples
to
the
parlor
;
which
was
a
change
very
like
*NL*
Joe
's
change
from
his
working-clothes
to
his
Sunday
dress
.
My
sister
was
*NL*
uncommonly
lively
on
the
present
occasion
,
and
indeed
was
generally
more
*NL*
gracious
in
the
society
of
Mrs.
Hubble
than
in
other
company
.
I
remember
*NL*
Mrs.
Hubble
as
a
little
curly
sharp-edged
person
in
sky-blue
,
who
held
a
*NL*
conventionally
juvenile
position
,
because
she
had
married
Mr.
Hubble
,
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
at
what
remote
period
,
--
when
she
was
much
younger
than
he
.
I
*NL*
remember
Mr
Hubble
as
a
tough
,
high-shouldered
,
stooping
old
man
,
of
a
*NL*
sawdusty
fragrance
,
with
his
legs
extraordinarily
wide
apart
:
so
that
in
*NL*
my
short
days
I
always
saw
some
miles
of
open
country
between
them
when
*NL*
I
met
him
coming
up
the
lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
this
good
company
I
should
have
felt
myself
,
even
if
I
had
n't
*NL*
robbed
the
pantry
,
in
a
false
position
.
Not
because
I
was
squeezed
in
*NL*
at
an
acute
angle
of
the
tablecloth
,
with
the
table
in
my
chest
,
and
the
*NL*
Pumblechookian
elbow
in
my
eye
,
nor
because
I
was
not
allowed
to
speak
*NL*
-LRB-
I
did
n't
want
to
speak
-RRB-
,
nor
because
I
was
regaled
with
the
scaly
tips
*NL*
of
the
drumsticks
of
the
fowls
,
and
with
those
obscure
corners
of
pork
*NL*
of
which
the
pig
,
when
living
,
had
had
the
least
reason
to
be
vain
.
No
;
*NL*
I
should
not
have
minded
that
,
if
they
would
only
have
left
me
alone
.
*NL*
But
they
would
n't
leave
me
alone
.
They
seemed
to
think
the
opportunity
*NL*
lost
,
if
they
failed
to
point
the
conversation
at
me
,
every
now
and
*NL*
then
,
and
stick
the
point
into
me
.
I
might
have
been
an
unfortunate
*NL*
little
bull
in
a
Spanish
arena
,
I
got
so
smartingly
touched
up
by
these
*NL*
moral
goads
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
the
moment
we
sat
down
to
dinner
.
Mr.
Wopsle
said
grace
with
*NL*
theatrical
declamation
,
--
as
it
now
appears
to
me
,
something
like
a
*NL*
religious
cross
of
the
Ghost
in
Hamlet
with
Richard
the
Third
,
--
and
*NL*
ended
with
the
very
proper
aspiration
that
we
might
be
truly
grateful
.
*NL*
Upon
which
my
sister
fixed
me
with
her
eye
,
and
said
,
in
a
low
*NL*
reproachful
voice
,
``
Do
you
hear
that
?
Be
grateful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Especially
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
``
be
grateful
,
boy
,
to
them
which
*NL*
brought
you
up
by
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hubble
shook
her
head
,
and
contemplating
me
with
a
mournful
*NL*
presentiment
that
I
should
come
to
no
good
,
asked
,
``
Why
is
it
that
the
*NL*
young
are
never
grateful
?
''
This
moral
mystery
seemed
too
much
for
*NL*
the
company
until
Mr.
Hubble
tersely
solved
it
by
saying
,
``
Naterally
*NL*
wicious
.
''
Everybody
then
murmured
``
True
!
''
and
looked
at
me
in
a
*NL*
particularly
unpleasant
and
personal
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
's
station
and
influence
were
something
feebler
-LRB-
if
possible
-RRB-
when
*NL*
there
was
company
than
when
there
was
none
.
But
he
always
aided
and
*NL*
comforted
me
when
he
could
,
in
some
way
of
his
own
,
and
he
always
did
so
*NL*
at
dinner-time
by
giving
me
gravy
,
if
there
were
any
.
There
being
plenty
*NL*
of
gravy
to-day
,
Joe
spooned
into
my
plate
,
at
this
point
,
about
half
a
*NL*
pint
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
later
on
in
the
dinner
,
Mr.
Wopsle
reviewed
the
sermon
with
*NL*
some
severity
,
and
intimated
--
in
the
usual
hypothetical
case
of
the
*NL*
Church
being
``
thrown
open
''
--
what
kind
of
sermon
he
would
have
given
*NL*
them
.
After
favoring
them
with
some
heads
of
that
discourse
,
he
remarked
*NL*
that
he
considered
the
subject
of
the
day
's
homily
,
ill
chosen
;
which
*NL*
was
the
less
excusable
,
he
added
,
when
there
were
so
many
subjects
*NL*
``
going
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
again
,
''
said
Uncle
Pumblechook
.
``
You
've
hit
it
,
sir
!
Plenty
of
*NL*
subjects
going
about
,
for
them
that
know
how
to
put
salt
upon
their
*NL*
tails
.
That
's
what
's
wanted
.
A
man
need
n't
go
far
to
find
a
subject
,
*NL*
if
he
's
ready
with
his
salt-box
.
''
Mr.
Pumblechook
added
,
after
a
short
*NL*
interval
of
reflection
,
``
Look
at
Pork
alone
.
There
's
a
subject
!
If
you
*NL*
want
a
subject
,
look
at
Pork
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
sir
.
Many
a
moral
for
the
young
,
''
returned
Mr.
Wopsle
,
--
and
I
*NL*
knew
he
was
going
to
lug
me
in
,
before
he
said
it
;
``
might
be
deduced
*NL*
from
that
text
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
You
listen
to
this
,
''
said
my
sister
to
me
,
in
a
severe
parenthesis
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
gave
me
some
more
gravy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Swine
,
''
pursued
Mr.
Wopsle
,
in
his
deepest
voice
,
and
pointing
his
fork
*NL*
at
my
blushes
,
as
if
he
were
mentioning
my
Christian
name
,
--
``
swine
were
*NL*
the
companions
of
the
prodigal
.
The
gluttony
of
Swine
is
put
before
us
,
*NL*
as
an
example
to
the
young
.
''
-LRB-
I
thought
this
pretty
well
in
him
who
*NL*
had
been
praising
up
the
pork
for
being
so
plump
and
juicy
.
-RRB-
``
What
is
*NL*
detestable
in
a
pig
is
more
detestable
in
a
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
girl
,
''
suggested
Mr.
Hubble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
or
girl
,
Mr.
Hubble
,
''
assented
Mr.
Wopsle
,
rather
irritably
,
*NL*
``
but
there
is
no
girl
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
turning
sharp
on
me
,
``
think
what
you
've
*NL*
got
to
be
grateful

been
born

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
,
if
ever
a
child

said
my
sister
,
most
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
gave
me
some
more
gravy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
I
mean
a
four-footed
Squeaker

said
Mr.
Pumblechook
.
``
If

had
been
born

,
would
you

``
Unless
in
that
form
,
''
said
Mr.
Wopsle
,
nodding
towards
the
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
mean
in
that
form
,
sir
,
''
returned
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
who
had
*NL*
an
objection
to
being
interrupted
;
``
I
mean
,
enjoying
himself
with
his
*NL*
elders
and
betters
,
and
improving
himself
with
their
conversation
,
and
*NL*
rolling
in
the
lap
of
luxury
.
Would
he
have
been
doing
that
?
No
,
he
*NL*
would
n't
.
And
what
would
have
been
your
destination
?
''
turning
on
me
*NL*
again
.
``
You
would
have
been
disposed
of
for
so
many
shillings
according
*NL*
to
the
market
price
of
the
article
,
and
Dunstable
the
butcher
would
have
*NL*
come
up
to
you
as
you
lay
in
your
straw
,
and
he
would
have
whipped
you
*NL*
under
his
left
arm
,
and
with
his
right
he
would
have
tucked
up
his
frock
*NL*
to
get
a
penknife
from
out
of
his
waistcoat-pocket
,
and
he
would
have
*NL*
shed
your
blood
and
had
your
life
.
No
bringing
up
by
hand
then
.
Not
a
*NL*
bit
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
offered
me
more
gravy
,
which
I
was
afraid
to
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
world
of
trouble
to
you
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hubble
,
*NL*
commiserating
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trouble
?
''
echoed
my
sister
;
``
trouble
?
''
and
then
entered
on
a
fearful
*NL*
catalogue
of
all
the
illnesses
I
had
been
guilty
of
,
and
all
the
acts
*NL*
of
sleeplessness
I
had
committed
,
and
all
the
high
places
I
had
tumbled
*NL*
from
,
and
all
the
low
places
I
had
tumbled
into
,
and
all
the
injuries
I
*NL*
had
done
myself
,
and
all
the
times
she
had
wished
me
in
my
grave
,
and
I
*NL*
had
contumaciously
refused
to
go
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
the
Romans
must
have
aggravated
one
another
very
much
,
with
*NL*
their
noses
.
Perhaps
,
they
became
the
restless
people
they
were
,
in
*NL*
consequence
.
Anyhow
,
Mr.
Wopsle
's
Roman
nose
so
aggravated
me
,
during
*NL*
the
recital
of
my
misdemeanours
,
that
I
should
have
liked
to
pull
it
*NL*
until
he
howled
.
But
,
all
I
had
endured
up
to
this
time
was
nothing
in
*NL*
comparison
with
the
awful
feelings
that
took
possession
of
me
when
the
*NL*
pause
was
broken
which
ensued
upon
my
sister
's
recital
,
and
in
which
*NL*
pause
everybody
had
looked
at
me
-LRB-
as
I
felt
painfully
conscious
-RRB-
with
*NL*
indignation
and
abhorrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
leading
the
company
gently
back
to
the
*NL*
theme
from
which
they
had
strayed
,
``
Pork
--
regarded
as
biled
--
is
rich
,
*NL*
too
;
ai
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
a
little
brandy
,
uncle
,
''
said
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
Heavens
,
it
had
come
at
last
!
He
would
find
it
was
weak
,
he
would
say
*NL*
it
was
weak
,
and
I
was
lost
!
I
held
tight
to
the
leg
of
the
table
under
*NL*
the
cloth
,
with
both
hands
,
and
awaited
my
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
went
for
the
stone
bottle
,
came
back
with
the
stone
bottle
,
*NL*
and
poured
his
brandy
out
:
no
one
else
taking
any
.
The
wretched
man
*NL*
trifled
with
his
glass
,
--
took
it
up
,
looked
at
it
through
the
light
,
*NL*
put
it
down
,
--
prolonged
my
misery
.
All
this
time
Mrs.
Joe
and
Joe
were
*NL*
briskly
clearing
the
table
for
the
pie
and
pudding
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
keep
my
eyes
off
him
.
Always
holding
tight
by
the
leg
of
the
*NL*
table
with
my
hands
and
feet
,
I
saw
the
miserable
creature
finger
his
*NL*
glass
playfully
,
take
it
up
,
smile
,
throw
his
head
back
,
and
drink
*NL*
the
brandy
off
.
Instantly
afterwards
,
the
company
were
seized
with
*NL*
unspeakable
consternation
,
owing
to
his
springing
to
his
feet
,
turning
*NL*
round
several
times
in
an
appalling
spasmodic
whooping-cough
dance
,
*NL*
and
rushing
out
at
the
door
;
he
then
became
visible
through
the
window
,
*NL*
violently
plunging
and
expectorating
,
making
the
most
hideous
faces
,
and
*NL*
apparently
out
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
held
on
tight
,
while
Mrs.
Joe
and
Joe
ran
to
him
.
I
did
n't
know
how
*NL*
I
had
done
it
,
but
I
had
no
doubt
I
had
murdered
him
somehow
.
In
my
*NL*
dreadful
situation
,
it
was
a
relief
when
he
was
brought
back
,
and
*NL*
surveying
the
company
all
round
as
if
they
had
disagreed
with
him
,
sank
*NL*
down
into
his
chair
with
the
one
significant
gasp
,
``
Tar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
filled
up
the
bottle
from
the
tar-water
jug
.
I
knew
he
would
be
*NL*
worse
by
and
by
.
I
moved
the
table
,
like
a
Medium
of
the
present
day
,
by
*NL*
the
vigor
of
my
unseen
hold
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tar
!
''
cried
my
sister
,
in
amazement
.
``
Why
,
how
ever
could
Tar
come
*NL*
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
Uncle
Pumblechook
,
who
was
omnipotent
in
that
kitchen
,
would
n't
*NL*
hear
the
word
,
would
n't
hear
of
the
subject
,
imperiously
waved
it
all
*NL*
away
with
his
hand
,
and
asked
for
hot
gin
and
water
.
My
sister
,
who
had
*NL*
begun
to
be
alarmingly
meditative
,
had
to
employ
herself
actively
in
*NL*
getting
the
gin
,
the
hot
water
,
the
sugar
,
and
the
lemon-peel
,
and
mixing
*NL*
them
.
For
the
time
being
at
least
,
I
was
saved
.
I
still
held
on
to
the
*NL*
leg
of
the
table
,
but
clutched
it
now
with
the
fervor
of
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
,
I
became
calm
enough
to
release
my
grasp
and
partake
of
*NL*
pudding
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
partook
of
pudding
.
All
partook
of
pudding
.
*NL*
The
course
terminated
,
and
Mr.
Pumblechook
had
begun
to
beam
under
the
*NL*
genial
influence
of
gin
and
water
.
I
began
to
think
I
should
get
over
*NL*
the
day
,
when
my
sister
said
to
Joe
,
``
Clean
plates
,
--
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
clutched
the
leg
of
the
table
again
immediately
,
and
pressed
it
to
my
*NL*
bosom
as
if
it
had
been
the
companion
of
my
youth
and
friend
of
my
soul
.
*NL*
I
foresaw
what
was
coming
,
and
I
felt
that
this
time
I
really
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
taste
,
''
said
my
sister
,
addressing
the
guests
with
her
best
*NL*
grace
--
``
you
must
taste
,
to
finish
with
,
such
a
delightful
and
delicious
*NL*
present
of
Uncle
Pumblechook
's
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Must
they
!
Let
them
not
hope
to
taste
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
know
,
''
said
my
sister
,
rising
,
``
it
's
a
pie
;
a
savory
pork
*NL*
pie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
murmured
their
compliments
.
Uncle
Pumblechook
,
sensible
of
*NL*
having
deserved
well
of
his
fellow-creatures
,
said
,
--
quite
vivaciously
,
*NL*
all
things
considered
,
--
``
Well
,
Mrs.
Joe
,
we
'll
do
our
best
endeavors
;
*NL*
let
us
have
a
cut
at
this
same
pie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
went
out
to
get
it
.
I
heard
her
steps
proceed
to
the
pantry
.
I
*NL*
saw
Mr.
Pumblechook
balance
his
knife
.
I
saw
reawakening
appetite
in
the
*NL*
Roman
nostrils
of
Mr.
Wopsle
.
I
heard
Mr.
Hubble
remark
that
``
a
bit
of
*NL*
savory
pork
pie
would
lay
atop
of
anything
you
could
mention
,
and
do
*NL*
no
harm
,
''
and
I
heard
Joe
say
,
``
You
shall
have
some
,
Pip
.
''
I
have
never
*NL*
been
absolutely
certain
whether
I
uttered
a
shrill
yell
of
terror
,
*NL*
merely
in
spirit
,
or
in
the
bodily
hearing
of
the
company
.
I
felt
that
I
*NL*
could
bear
no
more
,
and
that
I
must
run
away
.
I
released
the
leg
of
the
*NL*
table
,
and
ran
for
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
ran
no
farther
than
the
house
door
,
for
there
I
ran
head-foremost
*NL*
into
a
party
of
soldiers
with
their
muskets
,
one
of
whom
held
out
a
pair
*NL*
of
handcuffs
to
me
,
saying
,
``
Here
you
are
,
look
sharp
,
come
on
!

Chapter
V
*NL*
*NL*
The
apparition
of
a
file
of
soldiers
ringing
down
the
but-ends
of
their
*NL*
loaded
muskets
on
our
door-step
,
caused
the
dinner-party
to
rise
*NL*
from
table
in
confusion
,
and
caused
Mrs.
Joe
re-entering
the
kitchen
*NL*
empty-handed
,
to
stop
short
and
stare
,
in
her
wondering
lament
of
*NL*
``
Gracious
goodness
gracious
me
,
what
's
gone
--
with
the
--
pie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
and
I
were
in
the
kitchen
when
Mrs.
Joe
stood
staring
;
*NL*
at
which
crisis
I
partially
recovered
the
use
of
my
senses
.
It
was
*NL*
the
sergeant
who
had
spoken
to
me
,
and
he
was
now
looking
round
at
the
*NL*
company
,
with
his
handcuffs
invitingly
extended
towards
them
in
his
*NL*
right
hand
,
and
his
left
on
my
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
ladies
and
gentleman
,
''
said
the
sergeant
,
``
but
as
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
at
the
door
to
this
smart
young
shaver
,
''
-LRB-
which
he
had
n't
-RRB-
,
``
I
*NL*
am
on
a
chase
in
the
name
of
the
king
,
and
I
want
the
blacksmith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
what
might
you
want
with
him
?
''
retorted
my
sister
,
quick
to
*NL*
resent
his
being
wanted
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Missis
,
''
returned
the
gallant
sergeant
,
``
speaking
for
myself
,
I
should
*NL*
reply
,
the
honor
and
pleasure
of
his
fine
wife
's
acquaintance
;
speaking
*NL*
for
the
king
,
I
answer
,
a
little
job
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
received
as
rather
neat
in
the
sergeant
;
insomuch
that
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
cried
audibly
,
``
Good
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
blacksmith
,
''
said
the
sergeant
,
who
had
by
this
time
picked
*NL*
out
Joe
with
his
eye
,
``
we
have
had
an
accident
with
these
,
and
I
find
*NL*
the
lock
of
one
of
'em
goes
wrong
,
and
the
coupling
do
n't
act
pretty
.
*NL*
As
they
are
wanted
for
immediate
service
,
will
you
throw
your
eye
over
*NL*
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
threw
his
eye
over
them
,
and
pronounced
that
the
job
would
*NL*
necessitate
the
lighting
of
his
forge
fire
,
and
would
take
nearer
*NL*
two
hours
than
one
.
``
Will
it
?
Then
will
you
set
about
it
at
once
,
*NL*
blacksmith
?
''
said
the
off-hand
sergeant
,
``
as
it
's
on
his
Majesty
's
*NL*
service
.
And
if
my
men
can
bear
a
hand
anywhere
,
they
'll
make
themselves
*NL*
useful
.
''
With
that
,
he
called
to
his
men
,
who
came
trooping
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
one
after
another
,
and
piled
their
arms
in
a
corner
.
And
then
*NL*
they
stood
about
,
as
soldiers
do
;
now
,
with
their
hands
loosely
clasped
*NL*
before
them
;
now
,
resting
a
knee
or
a
shoulder
;
now
,
easing
a
belt
or
a
*NL*
pouch
;
now
,
opening
the
door
to
spit
stiffly
over
their
high
stocks
,
out
*NL*
into
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
things
I
saw
without
then
knowing
that
I
saw
them
,
for
I
*NL*
was
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
.
But
beginning
to
perceive
that
the
*NL*
handcuffs
were
not
for
me
,
and
that
the
military
had
so
far
got
the
*NL*
better
of
the
pie
as
to
put
it
in
the
background
,
I
collected
a
little
*NL*
more
of
my
scattered
wits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
give
me
the
time
?
''
said
the
sergeant
,
addressing
himself
to
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
as
to
a
man
whose
appreciative
powers
justified
the
*NL*
inference
that
he
was
equal
to
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
gone
half
past
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
so
bad
,
''
said
the
sergeant
,
reflecting
;
``
even
if
I
was
*NL*
forced
to
halt
here
nigh
two
hours
,
that
'll
do
.
How
far
might
you
call
*NL*
yourselves
from
the
marshes
,
hereabouts
?
Not
above
a
mile
,
I
reckon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
mile
,
''
said
Mrs.
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
do
.
We
begin
to
close
in
upon
'em
about
dusk
.
A
little
before
*NL*
dusk

my
orders
are
.
That
'll
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Convicts
,
sergeant
?
''
asked
Mr.
Wopsle
,
in
a
matter-of-course
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
''
returned
the
sergeant
,
``
two
.
They
're
pretty
well
known
to
be
out
*NL*
on
the
marshes
still
,
and
they
wo
n't
try
to
get
clear
of
'em
before
*NL*
dusk
.
Anybody
here
seen
anything
of
any
such
game
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
,
myself
excepted
,
said
no
,
with
confidence
.
Nobody
thought
of
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
the
sergeant
,
``
they
'll
find
themselves
trapped
in
a
circle

I
expect

sooner
than
they
count
on

Now
,
blacksmith
!
If
you
're
ready
,
*NL*
his
Majesty
the
King
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
had
got
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
cravat
off
,
and
his
leather
apron
*NL*
on
,
and
passed
into
the
forge
.
One
of
the
soldiers
opened
its
wooden
*NL*
windows
,
another
lighted
the
fire
,
another
turned
to
at
the
bellows
,
the
*NL*
rest
stood
round
the
blaze
,
which
was
soon
roaring
.
Then
Joe
began
to
*NL*
hammer
and
clink
,
hammer
and
clink
,
and
we
all
looked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interest
of
the
impending
pursuit
not
only
absorbed
the
general
*NL*
attention
,
but
even
made
my
sister
liberal
.
She
drew
a
pitcher
of
beer
*NL*
from
the
cask
for
the
soldiers
,
and
invited
the
sergeant
to
take
a
glass
*NL*
of
brandy
.
But
Mr.
Pumblechook
said
,
sharply
,
``
Give
him
wine
,
Mum
.
I
'll
*NL*
engage
there
's
no
tar
in
that
:
''
so
,
the
sergeant
thanked
him
and
said
*NL*
that
as
he
preferred
his
drink
without
tar
,
he
would
take
wine
,
if
it
*NL*
was
equally
convenient
.
When
it
was
given
him
,
he
drank
his
Majesty
's
*NL*
health
and
compliments
of
the
season
,
and
took
it
all
at
a
mouthful
and
*NL*
smacked
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
stuff
,
eh
,
sergeant
?
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
something
,
''
returned
the
sergeant
;
``
I
suspect
that
*NL*
stuff
's
of
your
providing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
with
a
fat
sort
of
laugh
,
said
,
``
Ay
,
ay
?
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
returned
the
sergeant
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
,
``
you
're
*NL*
a
man
that
knows
what
's
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'ye
think
so
?
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
with
his
former
laugh
.
``
Have
*NL*
another
glass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
you
.
Hob
and
nob
,
''
returned
the
sergeant
.
``
The
top
of
mine
to
the
*NL*
foot
of
yours
,
--
the
foot
of
yours
to
the
top
of
mine
,
--
Ring
once
,
ring
*NL*
twice
,
--
the
best
tune
on
the
Musical
Glasses
!
Your
health
.
May
you
live
*NL*
a
thousand
years
,
and
never
be
a
worse
judge
of
the
right
sort
than
you
*NL*
are
at
the
present
moment
of
your
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
tossed
off
his
glass
again
and
seemed
quite
ready
for
*NL*
another
glass
.
I
noticed
that
Mr.
Pumblechook
in
his
hospitality
*NL*
appeared
to
forget
that
he
had
made
a
present
of
the
wine
,
but
took
the
*NL*
bottle
from
Mrs.
Joe
and
had
all
the
credit
of
handing
it
about
in
a
*NL*
gush
of
joviality
.
Even
I
got
some
.
And
he
was
so
very
free
of
the
wine
*NL*
that
he
even
called
for
the
other
bottle
,
and
handed
that
about
with
the
*NL*
same
liberality
,
when
the
first
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
watched
them
while
they
all
stood
clustering
about
the
forge
,
*NL*
enjoying
themselves
so
much
,
I
thought
what
terrible
good
sauce
for
*NL*
a
dinner
my
fugitive
friend
on
the
marshes
was
.
They
had
not
enjoyed
*NL*
themselves
a
quarter
so
much
,
before
the
entertainment
was
brightened
*NL*
with
the
excitement
he
furnished
.
And
now
,
when
they
were
all
in
lively
*NL*
anticipation
of
``
the
two
villains
''
being
taken
,
and
when
the
bellows
*NL*
seemed
to
roar
for
the
fugitives
,
the
fire
to
flare
for
them
,
the
smoke
*NL*
to
hurry
away
in
pursuit
of
them
,
Joe
to
hammer
and
clink
for
them
,
*NL*
and
all
the
murky
shadows
on
the
wall
to
shake
at
them
in
menace
as
the
*NL*
blaze
rose
and
sank
,
and
the
red-hot
sparks
dropped
and
died
,
the
pale
*NL*
afternoon
outside
almost
seemed
in
my
pitying
young
fancy
to
have
turned
*NL*
pale
on
their
account
,
poor
wretches
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
Joe
's
job
was
done
,
and
the
ringing
and
roaring
stopped
.
As
Joe
*NL*
got
on
his
coat
,
he
mustered
courage
to
propose
that
some
of
us
should
*NL*
go
down
with
the
soldiers
and
see
what
came
of
the
hunt
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
*NL*
and
Mr.
Hubble
declined
,
on
the
plea
of
a
pipe
and
ladies
'
society
;
but
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
said
he
would
go
,
if
Joe
would
.
Joe
said
he
was
agreeable
,
*NL*
and
would
take
me
,
if
Mrs.
Joe
approved
.
We
never
should
have
got
leave
*NL*
to
go
,
I
am
sure
,
but
for
Mrs.
Joe
's
curiosity
to
know
all
about
it
and
*NL*
how
it
ended
.
As
it
was
,
she
merely
stipulated
,
``
If
you
bring
the
boy
*NL*
back
with
his
head
blown
to
bits
by
a
musket
,
do
n't
look
to
me
to
put
it
*NL*
together
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
took
a
polite
leave
of
the
ladies
,
and
parted
from
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
as
from
a
comrade
;
though
I
doubt
if
he
were
quite
as
fully
*NL*
sensible
of
that
gentleman
's
merits
under
arid
conditions
,
as
when
*NL*
something
moist
was
going
.
His
men
resumed
their
muskets
and
fell
in
.
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
,
Joe
,
and
I
,
received
strict
charge
to
keep
in
the
rear
,
and
*NL*
to
speak
no
word
after
we
reached
the
marshes
.
When
we
were
all
out
in
*NL*
the
raw
air
and
were
steadily
moving
towards
our
business
,
I
treasonably
*NL*
whispered
to
Joe
,
``
I
hope
,
Joe
,
we
sha
n't
find
them
.
''
and
Joe
whispered
*NL*
to
me
,
``
I
'd
give
a
shilling
if
they
had
cut
and
run
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
joined
by
no
stragglers
from
the
village
,
for
the
weather
was
*NL*
cold
and
threatening
,
the
way
dreary
,
the
footing
bad
,
darkness
coming
*NL*
on
,
and
the
people
had
good
fires
in-doors
and
were
keeping
the
day
.
A
*NL*
few
faces
hurried
to
glowing
windows
and
looked
after
us
,
but
none
came
*NL*
out
.
We
passed
the
finger-post
,
and
held
straight
on
to
the
churchyard
.
*NL*
There
we
were
stopped
a
few
minutes
by
a
signal
from
the
sergeant
's
*NL*
hand
,
while
two
or
three
of
his
men
dispersed
themselves
among
the
*NL*
graves
,
and
also
examined
the
porch
.
They
came
in
again
without
finding
*NL*
anything
,
and
then
we
struck
out
on
the
open
marshes
,
through
the
gate
*NL*
at
the
side
of
the
churchyard
.
A
bitter
sleet
came
rattling
against
us
*NL*
here
on
the
east
wind
,
and
Joe
took
me
on
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
we
were
out
upon
the
dismal
wilderness
where
they
little
*NL*
thought
I
had
been
within
eight
or
nine
hours
and
had
seen
both
men
*NL*
hiding
,
I
considered
for
the
first
time
,
with
great
dread
,
if
we
should
*NL*
come
upon
them
,
would
my
particular
convict
suppose
that
it
was
I
who
*NL*
had
brought
the
soldiers
there
?
He
had
asked
me
if
I
was
a
deceiving
*NL*
imp
,
and
he
had
said
I
should
be
a
fierce
young
hound
if
I
joined
the
*NL*
hunt
against
him
.
Would
he
believe
that
I
was
both
imp
and
hound
in
*NL*
treacherous
earnest
,
and
had
betrayed
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
of
no
use
asking
myself
this
question
now
.
There
I
was
,
on
Joe
's
*NL*
back
,
and
there
was
Joe
beneath
me
,
charging
at
the
ditches
like
a
*NL*
hunter
,
and
stimulating
Mr.
Wopsle
not
to
tumble
on
his
Roman
nose
,
and
*NL*
to
keep
up
with
us
.
The
soldiers
were
in
front
of
us
,
extending
into
a
*NL*
pretty
wide
line
with
an
interval
between
man
and
man
.
We
were
taking
*NL*
the
course
I
had
begun
with
,
and
from
which
I
had
diverged
in
the
mist
.
*NL*
Either
the
mist
was
not
out
again
yet
,
or
the
wind
had
dispelled
it
.
*NL*
Under
the
low
red
glare
of
sunset
,
the
beacon
,
and
the
gibbet
,
and
the
*NL*
mound
of
the
Battery
,
and
the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
,
were
plain
,
*NL*
though
all
of
a
watery
lead
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
my
heart
thumping
like
a
blacksmith
at
Joe
's
broad
shoulder
,
I
*NL*
looked
all
about
for
any
sign
of
the
convicts
.
I
could
see
none
,
I
could
*NL*
hear
none
.
Mr.
Wopsle
had
greatly
alarmed
me
more
than
once
,
by
his
*NL*
blowing
and
hard
breathing
;
but
I
knew
the
sounds
by
this
time
,
and
*NL*
could
dissociate
them
from
the
object
of
pursuit
.
I
got
a
dreadful
*NL*
start
,
when
I
thought
I
heard
the
file
still
going
;
but
it
was
only
a
*NL*
sheep-bell
.
The
sheep
stopped
in
their
eating
and
looked
timidly
at
*NL*
us
;
and
the
cattle
,
their
heads
turned
from
the
wind
and
sleet
,
stared
*NL*
angrily
as
if
they
held
us
responsible
for
both
annoyances
;
but
,
except
*NL*
these
things
,
and
the
shudder
of
the
dying
day
in
every
blade
of
grass
,
*NL*
there
was
no
break
in
the
bleak
stillness
of
the
marshes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
were
moving
on
in
the
direction
of
the
old
Battery
,
and
we
*NL*
were
moving
on
a
little
way
behind
them
,
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
we
all
*NL*
stopped
.
For
there
had
reached
us
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
and
rain
,
a
*NL*
long
shout
.
It
was
repeated
.
It
was
at
a
distance
towards
the
east
,
but
*NL*
it
was
long
and
loud
.
Nay
,
there
seemed
to
be
two
or
more
shouts
raised
*NL*
together
,
--
if
one
might
judge
from
a
confusion
in
the
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
effect
the
sergeant
and
the
nearest
men
were
speaking
under
*NL*
their
breath
,
when
Joe
and
I
came
up
.
After
another
moment
's
listening
,
*NL*
Joe
-LRB-
who
was
a
good
judge
-RRB-
agreed
,
and
Mr.
Wopsle
-LRB-
who
was
a
bad
judge
-RRB-
*NL*
agreed
.
The
sergeant
,
a
decisive
man
,
ordered
that
the
sound
should
not
*NL*
be
answered
,
but
that
the
course
should
be
changed
,
and
that
his
men
*NL*
should
make
towards
it
``
at
the
double
.
''
So
we
slanted
to
the
right
*NL*
-LRB-
where
the
East
was
-RRB-
,
and
Joe
pounded
away
so
wonderfully
,
that
I
had
to
*NL*
hold
on
tight
to
keep
my
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
run
indeed
now
,
and
what
Joe
called
,
in
the
only
two
words
he
*NL*
spoke
all
the
time
,
``
a
Winder
.
''
Down
banks
and
up
banks
,
and
over
gates
,
*NL*
and
splashing
into
dikes
,
and
breaking
among
coarse
rushes
:
no
man
cared
*NL*
where
he
went
.
As
we
came
nearer
to
the
shouting
,
it
became
more
and
*NL*
more
apparent
that
it
was
made
by
more
than
one
voice
.
Sometimes
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
stop
altogether
,
and
then
the
soldiers
stopped
.
When
it
broke
*NL*
out
again
,
the
soldiers
made
for
it
at
a
greater
rate
than
ever
,
and
we
*NL*
after
them
.
After
a
while
,
we
had
so
run
it
down
,
that
we
could
hear
one
*NL*
voice
calling
``
Murder
!
''
and
another
voice
,
``
Convicts
!
Runaways
!
Guard
!
*NL*
This
way
for
the
runaway
convicts
!
''
Then
both
voices
would
seem
to
be
*NL*
stifled
in
a
struggle
,
and
then
would
break
out
again
.
And
when
it
had
*NL*
come
to
this
,
the
soldiers
ran
like
deer
,
and
Joe
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
ran
in
first
,
when
we
had
run
the
noise
quite
down
,
and
two
*NL*
of
his
men
ran
in
close
upon
him
.
Their
pieces
were
cocked
and
levelled
*NL*
when
we
all
ran
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
both
men
!
''
panted
the
sergeant
,
struggling
at
the
bottom
of
a
*NL*
ditch
.
``
Surrender
,
you
two
!
and
confound
you
for
two
wild
beasts
!
Come
*NL*
asunder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Water
was
splashing
,
and
mud
was
flying
,
and
oaths
were
being
sworn
,
and
*NL*
blows
were
being
struck
,
when
some
more
men
went
down
into
the
ditch
to
*NL*
help
the
sergeant
,
and
dragged
out
,
separately
,
my
convict
and
the
other
*NL*
one
.
Both
were
bleeding
and
panting
and
execrating
and
struggling
;
but
*NL*
of
course
I
knew
them
both
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
!
''
said
my
convict
,
wiping
blood
from
his
face
with
his
ragged
*NL*
sleeves
,
and
shaking
torn
hair
from
his
fingers
:
``
I
took
him
!
I
give
him
*NL*
up
to
you
!
Mind
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
much
to
be
particular
about
,
''
said
the
sergeant
;
``
it
'll
do
you
*NL*
small
good
,
my
man
,
being
in
the
same
plight
yourself
.
Handcuffs
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
expect
it
to
do
me
any
good
.
I
do
n't
want
it
to
do
me
more
good
*NL*
than
it
does
now
,
''
said
my
convict
,
with
a
greedy
laugh
.
``
I
took
him
.
He
*NL*
knows
it
.
That
's
enough
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
convict
was
livid
to
look
at
,
and
,
in
addition
to
the
old
*NL*
bruised
left
side
of
his
face
,
seemed
to
be
bruised
and
torn
all
over
.
*NL*
He
could
not
so
much
as
get
his
breath
to
speak
,
until
they
were
both
*NL*
separately
handcuffed
,
but
leaned
upon
a
soldier
to
keep
himself
from
*NL*
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
notice
,
guard
,
--
he
tried
to
murder
me
,
''
were
his
first
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tried
to
murder
him
?
''
said
my
convict
,
disdainfully
.
``
Try
,
and
not
*NL*
do
it
?
I
took
him
,
and
giv
'
him
up
;
that
's
what
I
done
.
I
not
only
*NL*
prevented
him
getting
off
the
marshes
,
but
I
dragged
him
here
,
--
dragged
*NL*
him
this
far
on
his
way
back
.
He
's
a
gentleman
,
if
you
please
,
this
*NL*
villain
.
Now
,
the
Hulks
has
got
its
gentleman
again
,
through
me
.
Murder
*NL*
him
?
Worth
my
while
,
too
,
to
murder
him
,
when
I
could
do
worse
and
drag
*NL*
him
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
one
still
gasped
,
``
He
tried
--
he
tried-to
--
murder
me
.
*NL*
Bear
--
bear
witness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookee
here
!
''
said
my
convict
to
the
sergeant
.
``
Single-handed
I
got
*NL*
clear
of
the
prison-ship
;
I
made
a
dash
and
I
done
it
.
I
could
ha
'
got
*NL*
clear
of
these
death-cold
flats
likewise
--
look
at
my
leg
:
you
wo
n't
find
*NL*
much
iron
on
it
--
if
I
had
n't
made
the
discovery
that
he
was
here
.
Let
*NL*
him
go
free
?
Let
him
profit
by
the
means
as
I
found
out
?
Let
him
make
a
*NL*
tool
of
me
afresh
and
again
?
Once
more
?
No
,
no
,
no
.
If
I
had
died
at
*NL*
the
bottom
there
,
''
and
he
made
an
emphatic
swing
at
the
ditch
with
his
*NL*
manacled
hands
,
``
I
'd
have
held
to
him
with
that
grip
,
that
you
should
*NL*
have
been
safe
to
find
him
in
my
hold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
fugitive
,
who
was
evidently
in
extreme
horror
of
his
*NL*
companion
,
repeated
,
``
He
tried
to
murder
me
.
I
should
have
been
a
dead
*NL*
man
if
you
had
not
come
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
lies
!
''
said
my
convict
,
with
fierce
energy
.
``
He
's
a
liar
born
,
and
*NL*
he
'll
die
a
liar
.
Look
at
his
face
;
ai
n't
it
written
there
?
Let
him
turn
*NL*
those
eyes
of
his
on
me
.
I
defy
him
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
,
with
an
effort
at
a
scornful
smile
,
which
could
not
,
however
,
*NL*
collect
the
nervous
working
of
his
mouth
into
any
set
expression
,
looked
*NL*
at
the
soldiers
,
and
looked
about
at
the
marshes
and
at
the
sky
,
but
*NL*
certainly
did
not
look
at
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
him
?
''
pursued
my
convict
.
``
Do
you
see
what
a
villain
he
is
?
*NL*
Do
you
see
those
grovelling
and
wandering
eyes
?
That
's
how
he
looked
*NL*
when
we
were
tried
together
.
He
never
looked
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
,
always
working
and
working
his
dry
lips
and
turning
his
eyes
*NL*
restlessly
about
him
far
and
near
,
did
at
last
turn
them
for
a
moment
on
*NL*
the
speaker
,
with
the
words
,
``
You
are
not
much
to
look
at
,
''
and
with
*NL*
a
half-taunting
glance
at
the
bound
hands
.
At
that
point
,
my
convict
*NL*
became
so
frantically
exasperated
,
that
he
would
have
rushed
upon
him
*NL*
but
for
the
interposition
of
the
soldiers
.
``
Did
n't
I
tell
you
,
''
said
the
*NL*
other
convict
then
,
``
that
he
would
murder
me
,
if
he
could
?
''
And
any
one
*NL*
could
see
that
he
shook
with
fear
,
and
that
there
broke
out
upon
his
*NL*
lips
curious
white
flakes
,
like
thin
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
of
this
parley
,
''
said
the
sergeant
.
``
Light
those
torches
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
one
of
the
soldiers
,
who
carried
a
basket
in
lieu
of
a
gun
,
went
down
*NL*
on
his
knee
to
open
it
,
my
convict
looked
round
him
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
and
saw
me
.
I
had
alighted
from
Joe
's
back
on
the
brink
of
the
ditch
*NL*
when
we
came
up
,
and
had
not
moved
since
.
I
looked
at
him
eagerly
when
*NL*
he
looked
at
me
,
and
slightly
moved
my
hands
and
shook
my
head
.
I
had
*NL*
been
waiting
for
him
to
see
me
that
I
might
try
to
assure
him
of
my
*NL*
innocence
.
It
was
not
at
all
expressed
to
me
that
he
even
comprehended
*NL*
my
intention
,
for
he
gave
me
a
look
that
I
did
not
understand
,
and
it
*NL*
all
passed
in
a
moment
.
But
if
he
had
looked
at
me
for
an
hour
or
for
*NL*
a
day
,
I
could
not
have
remembered
his
face
ever
afterwards
,
as
having
*NL*
been
more
attentive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
with
the
basket
soon
got
a
light
,
and
lighted
three
or
four
*NL*
torches
,
and
took
one
himself
and
distributed
the
others
.
It
had
been
*NL*
almost
dark
before
,
but
now
it
seemed
quite
dark
,
and
soon
afterwards
*NL*
very
dark
.
Before
we
departed
from
that
spot
,
four
soldiers
standing
in
*NL*
a
ring
,
fired
twice
into
the
air
.
Presently
we
saw
other
torches
kindled
*NL*
at
some
distance
behind
us
,
and
others
on
the
marshes
on
the
opposite
*NL*
bank
of
the
river
.
``
All
right
,
''
said
the
sergeant
.
``
March
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
not
gone
far
when
three
cannon
were
fired
ahead
of
us
with
a
*NL*
sound
that
seemed
to
burst
something
inside
my
ear
.
``
You
are
expected
*NL*
on
board
,
''
said
the
sergeant
to
my
convict
;
``
they
know
you
are
coming
.
*NL*
Do
n't
straggle
,
my
man
.
Close
up
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
were
kept
apart
,
and
each
walked
surrounded
by
a
separate
guard
.
*NL*
I
had
hold
of
Joe
's
hand
now
,
and
Joe
carried
one
of
the
torches
.
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
had
been
for
going
back
,
but
Joe
was
resolved
to
see
it
out
,
so
*NL*
we
went
on
with
the
party
.
There
was
a
reasonably
good
path
now
,
mostly
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
the
river
,
with
a
divergence
here
and
there
where
a
dike
*NL*
came
,
with
a
miniature
windmill
on
it
and
a
muddy
sluice-gate
.
When
*NL*
I
looked
round
,
I
could
see
the
other
lights
coming
in
after
us
.
The
*NL*
torches
we
carried
dropped
great
blotches
of
fire
upon
the
track
,
and
*NL*
I
could
see
those
,
too
,
lying
smoking
and
flaring
.
I
could
see
nothing
*NL*
else
but
black
darkness
.
Our
lights
warmed
the
air
about
us
with
their
*NL*
pitchy
blaze
,
and
the
two
prisoners
seemed
rather
to
like
that
,
as
they
*NL*
limped
along
in
the
midst
of
the
muskets
.
We
could
not
go
fast
,
because
*NL*
of
their
lameness
;
and
they
were
so
spent
,
that
two
or
three
times
we
*NL*
had
to
halt
while
they
rested
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
hour
or
so
of
this
travelling
,
we
came
to
a
rough
wooden
hut
*NL*
and
a
landing-place
.
There
was
a
guard
in
the
hut
,
and
they
challenged
,
*NL*
and
the
sergeant
answered
.
Then
,
we
went
into
the
hut
,
where
there
was
*NL*
a
smell
of
tobacco
and
whitewash
,
and
a
bright
fire
,
and
a
lamp
,
and
*NL*
a
stand
of
muskets
,
and
a
drum
,
and
a
low
wooden
bedstead
,
like
an
*NL*
overgrown
mangle
without
the
machinery
,
capable
of
holding
about
a
dozen
*NL*
soldiers
all
at
once
.
Three
or
four
soldiers
who
lay
upon
it
in
their
*NL*
great-coats
were
not
much
interested
in
us
,
but
just
lifted
their
heads
*NL*
and
took
a
sleepy
stare
,
and
then
lay
down
again
.
The
sergeant
made
some
*NL*
kind
of
report
,
and
some
entry
in
a
book
,
and
then
the
convict
whom
I
*NL*
call
the
other
convict
was
drafted
off
with
his
guard
,
to
go
on
board
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
convict
never
looked
at
me
,
except
that
once
.
While
we
stood
in
the
*NL*
hut
,
he
stood
before
the
fire
looking
thoughtfully
at
it
,
or
putting
up
*NL*
his
feet
by
turns
upon
the
hob
,
and
looking
thoughtfully
at
them
as
if
*NL*
he
pitied
them
for
their
recent
adventures
.
Suddenly
,
he
turned
to
the
*NL*
sergeant
,
and
remarked
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
say
something
respecting
this
escape
.
It
may
prevent
some
*NL*
persons
laying
under
suspicion
alonger
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
say
what
you
like
,
''
returned
the
sergeant
,
standing
coolly
*NL*
looking
at
him
with
his
arms
folded
,
``
but
you
have
no
call
to
say
it
*NL*
here
.
You
'll
have
opportunity
enough
to
say
about
it
,
and
hear
about
it
,
*NL*
before
it
's
done
with
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
but
this
is
another
pint
,
a
separate
matter
.
A
man
ca
n't
*NL*
starve
;
at
least
I
ca
n't
.
I
took
some
wittles
,
up
at
the
willage
over
*NL*
yonder
,
--
where
the
church
stands
a
`
most
out
on
the
marshes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
stole
,
''
said
the
sergeant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
tell
you
where
from
.
From
the
blacksmith
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
''
said
the
sergeant
,
staring
at
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
,
Pip
!
''
said
Joe
,
staring
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
some
broken
wittles
--
that
's
what
it
was
--
and
a
dram
of
liquor
,
*NL*
and
a
pie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
happened
to
miss
such
an
article
as
a
pie
,
blacksmith
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
sergeant
,
confidentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
did
,
at
the
very
moment
when
you
came
in
.
Do
n't
you
know
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
my
convict
,
turning
his
eyes
on
Joe
in
a
moody
manner
,
and
*NL*
without
the
least
glance
at
me
,
--
``
so
you
're
the
blacksmith
,
are
you
?
*NL*
Than
I
'm
sorry
to
say
,
I
've
eat
your
pie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
knows
you
're
welcome
to
it
,
--
so
far
as
it
was
ever
mine
,
''
returned
*NL*
Joe
,
with
a
saving
remembrance
of
Mrs.
Joe
.
``
We
do
n't
know
what
you
have
*NL*
done
,
but
we
would
n't
have
you
starved
to
death
for
it
,
poor
miserable
*NL*
fellow-creatur
.
--
Would
us
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
something
that
I
had
noticed
before
,
clicked
in
the
man
's
throat
*NL*
again
,
and
he
turned
his
back
.
The
boat
had
returned
,
and
his
guard
were
*NL*
ready
,
so
we
followed
him
to
the
landing-place
made
of
rough
stakes
*NL*
and
stones
,
and
saw
him
put
into
the
boat
,
which
was
rowed
by
a
crew
of
*NL*
convicts
like
himself
.
No
one
seemed
surprised
to
see
him
,
or
interested
*NL*
in
seeing
him
,
or
glad
to
see
him
,
or
sorry
to
see
him
,
or
spoke
a
word
,
*NL*
except
that
somebody
in
the
boat
growled
as
if
to
dogs
,
``
Give
way
,
*NL*
you
!
''
which
was
the
signal
for
the
dip
of
the
oars
.
By
the
light
of
the
*NL*
torches
,
we
saw
the
black
Hulk
lying
out
a
little
way
from
the
mud
of
*NL*
the
shore
,
like
a
wicked
Noah
's
ark
.
Cribbed
and
barred
and
moored
by
*NL*
massive
rusty
chains
,
the
prison-ship
seemed
in
my
young
eyes
to
be
*NL*
ironed
like
the
prisoners
.
We
saw
the
boat
go
alongside
,
and
we
saw
*NL*
him
taken
up
the
side
and
disappear
.
Then
,
the
ends
of
the
torches
were
*NL*
flung
hissing
into
the
water
,
and
went
out
,
as
if
it
were
all
over
with
*NL*
him
.

*NL*
Chapter
VI
*NL*
*NL*
My
state
of
mind
regarding
the
pilfering
from
which
I
had
been
so
*NL*
unexpectedly
exonerated
did
not
impel
me
to
frank
disclosure
;
but
I
hope
*NL*
it
had
some
dregs
of
good
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
recall
that
I
felt
any
tenderness
of
conscience
in
reference
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Joe
,
when
the
fear
of
being
found
out
was
lifted
off
me
.
But
*NL*
I
loved
Joe
,
--
perhaps
for
no
better
reason
in
those
early
days
than
*NL*
because
the
dear
fellow
let
me
love
him
,
--
and
,
as
to
him
,
my
inner
self
*NL*
was
not
so
easily
composed
.
It
was
much
upon
my
mind
-LRB-
particularly
when
*NL*
I
first
saw
him
looking
about
for
his
file
-RRB-
that
I
ought
to
tell
Joe
the
*NL*
whole
truth
.
Yet
I
did
not
,
and
for
the
reason
that
I
mistrusted
that
*NL*
if
I
did
,
he
would
think
me
worse
than
I
was
.
The
fear
of
losing
Joe
's
*NL*
confidence
,
and
of
thenceforth
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
at
night
*NL*
staring
drearily
at
my
forever
lost
companion
and
friend
,
tied
up
my
*NL*
tongue
.
I
morbidly
represented
to
myself
that
if
Joe
knew
it
,
I
never
*NL*
afterwards
could
see
him
at
the
fireside
feeling
his
fair
whisker
,
*NL*
without
thinking
that
he
was
meditating
on
it
.
That
,
if
Joe
knew
it
,
I
*NL*
never
afterwards
could
see
him
glance
,
however
casually
,
at
yesterday
's
*NL*
meat
or
pudding
when
it
came
on
to-day
's
table
,
without
thinking
that
he
*NL*
was
debating
whether
I
had
been
in
the
pantry
.
That
,
if
Joe
knew
it
,
and
*NL*
at
any
subsequent
period
of
our
joint
domestic
life
remarked
that
his
*NL*
beer
was
flat
or
thick
,
the
conviction
that
he
suspected
tar
in
it
,
*NL*
would
bring
a
rush
of
blood
to
my
face
.
In
a
word
,
I
was
too
cowardly
*NL*
to
do
what
I
knew
to
be
right
,
as
I
had
been
too
cowardly
to
avoid
doing
*NL*
what
I
knew
to
be
wrong
.
I
had
had
no
intercourse
with
the
world
at
*NL*
that
time
,
and
I
imitated
none
of
its
many
inhabitants
who
act
in
this
*NL*
manner
.
Quite
an
untaught
genius
,
I
made
the
discovery
of
the
line
of
*NL*
action
for
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
sleepy
before
we
were
far
away
from
the
prison-ship
,
Joe
took
*NL*
me
on
his
back
again
and
carried
me
home
.
He
must
have
had
a
tiresome
*NL*
journey
of
it
,
for
Mr.
Wopsle
,
being
knocked
up
,
was
in
such
a
very
bad
*NL*
temper
that
if
the
Church
had
been
thrown
open
,
he
would
probably
have
*NL*
excommunicated
the
whole
expedition
,
beginning
with
Joe
and
myself
.
In
*NL*
his
lay
capacity
,
he
persisted
in
sitting
down
in
the
damp
to
such
*NL*
an
insane
extent
,
that
when
his
coat
was
taken
off
to
be
dried
at
the
*NL*
kitchen
fire
,
the
circumstantial
evidence
on
his
trousers
would
have
*NL*
hanged
him
,
if
it
had
been
a
capital
offence
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
that
time
,
I
was
staggering
on
the
kitchen
floor
like
a
little
*NL*
drunkard
,
through
having
been
newly
set
upon
my
feet
,
and
through
having
*NL*
been
fast
asleep
,
and
through
waking
in
the
heat
and
lights
and
noise
of
*NL*
tongues
.
As
I
came
to
myself
-LRB-
with
the
aid
of
a
heavy
thump
between
the
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
the
restorative
exclamation
``
Yah
!
Was
there
ever
such
*NL*
a
boy
as
this
!
''
from
my
sister
,
-RRB-
I
found
Joe
telling
them
about
the
*NL*
convict
's
confession
,
and
all
the
visitors
suggesting
different
ways
*NL*
by
which
he
had
got
into
the
pantry
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
made
out
,
after
*NL*
carefully
surveying
the
premises
,
that
he
had
first
got
upon
the
roof
of
*NL*
the
forge
,
and
had
then
got
upon
the
roof
of
the
house
,
and
had
then
let
*NL*
himself
down
the
kitchen
chimney
by
a
rope
made
of
his
bedding
cut
*NL*
into
strips
;
and
as
Mr.
Pumblechook
was
very
positive
and
drove
his
*NL*
own
chaise-cart
--
over
everybody
--
it
was
agreed
that
it
must
be
so
.
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
,
indeed
,
wildly
cried
out
,
``
No
!
''
with
the
feeble
malice
of
a
*NL*
tired
man
;
but
,
as
he
had
no
theory
,
and
no
coat
on
,
he
was
unanimously
*NL*
set
at
naught
,
--
not
to
mention
his
smoking
hard
behind
,
as
he
stood
*NL*
with
his
back
to
the
kitchen
fire
to
draw
the
damp
out
:
which
was
not
*NL*
calculated
to
inspire
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
I
heard
that
night
before
my
sister
clutched
me
,
as
a
*NL*
slumberous
offence
to
the
company
's
eyesight
,
and
assisted
me
up
to
bed
*NL*
with
such
a
strong
hand
that
I
seemed
to
have
fifty
boots
on
,
and
to
be
*NL*
dangling
them
all
against
the
edges
of
the
stairs
.
My
state
of
mind
,
as
*NL*
I
have
described
it
,
began
before
I
was
up
in
the
morning
,
and
lasted
*NL*
long
after
the
subject
had
died
out
,
and
had
ceased
to
be
mentioned
*NL*
saving
on
exceptional
occasions
.

*NL*
Chapter
VII
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
when
I
stood
in
the
churchyard
reading
the
family
*NL*
tombstones
,
I
had
just
enough
learning
to
be
able
to
spell
them
out
.
My
*NL*
construction
even
of
their
simple
meaning
was
not
very
correct
,
for
I
*NL*
read
``
wife
of
the
Above
''
as
a
complimentary
reference
to
my
father
's
*NL*
exaltation
to
a
better
world
;
and
if
any
one
of
my
deceased
relations
*NL*
had
been
referred
to
as
``
Below
,
''
I
have
no
doubt
I
should
have
formed
*NL*
the
worst
opinions
of
that
member
of
the
family
.
Neither
were
my
notions
*NL*
of
the
theological
positions
to
which
my
Catechism
bound
me
,
at
*NL*
all
accurate
;
for
,
I
have
a
lively
remembrance
that
I
supposed
my
*NL*
declaration
that
I
was
to
``
walk
in
the
same
all
the
days
of
my
life
,
''
*NL*
laid
me
under
an
obligation
always
to
go
through
the
village
from
our
*NL*
house
in
one
particular
direction
,
and
never
to
vary
it
by
turning
down
*NL*
by
the
wheelwright
's
or
up
by
the
mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
old
enough
,
I
was
to
be
apprenticed
to
Joe
,
and
until
I
could
*NL*
assume
that
dignity
I
was
not
to
be
what
Mrs.
Joe
called
``
Pompeyed
,
''
or
*NL*
-LRB-
as
I
render
it
-RRB-
pampered
.
Therefore
,
I
was
not
only
odd-boy
about
the
*NL*
forge
,
but
if
any
neighbor
happened
to
want
an
extra
boy
to
frighten
*NL*
birds
,
or
pick
up
stones
,
or
do
any
such
job
,
I
was
favored
with
the
*NL*
employment
.
In
order
,
however
,
that
our
superior
position
might
not
be
*NL*
compromised
thereby
,
a
money-box
was
kept
on
the
kitchen
mantel-shelf
,
*NL*
into
which
it
was
publicly
made
known
that
all
my
earnings
were
*NL*
dropped
.
I
have
an
impression
that
they
were
to
be
contributed
*NL*
eventually
towards
the
liquidation
of
the
National
Debt
,
but
I
know
I
*NL*
had
no
hope
of
any
personal
participation
in
the
treasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
kept
an
evening
school
in
the
village
;
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
she
was
a
ridiculous
old
woman
of
limited
means
and
unlimited
*NL*
infirmity
,
who
used
to
go
to
sleep
from
six
to
seven
every
evening
,
in
*NL*
the
society
of
youth
who
paid
two
pence
per
week
each
,
for
the
improving
*NL*
opportunity
of
seeing
her
do
it
.
She
rented
a
small
cottage
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
had
the
room
upstairs
,
where
we
students
used
to
overhear
him
*NL*
reading
aloud
in
a
most
dignified
and
terrific
manner
,
and
occasionally
*NL*
bumping
on
the
ceiling
.
There
was
a
fiction
that
Mr.
Wopsle
``
examined
''
*NL*
the
scholars
once
a
quarter
.
What
he
did
on
those
occasions
was
to
turn
*NL*
up
his
cuffs
,
stick
up
his
hair
,
and
give
us
Mark
Antony
's
oration
over
*NL*
the
body
of
Caesar
.
This
was
always
followed
by
Collins
's
Ode
on
*NL*
the
Passions
,
wherein
I
particularly
venerated
Mr.
Wopsle
as
Revenge
*NL*
throwing
his
blood-stained
sword
in
thunder
down
,
and
taking
the
*NL*
War-denouncing
trumpet
with
a
withering
look
.
It
was
not
with
me
then
,
*NL*
as
it
was
in
later
life
,
when
I
fell
into
the
society
of
the
Passions
,
*NL*
and
compared
them
with
Collins
and
Wopsle
,
rather
to
the
disadvantage
of
*NL*
both
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
,
besides
keeping
this
Educational
Institution
,
*NL*
kept
in
the
same
room
--
a
little
general
shop
.
She
had
no
idea
what
stock
*NL*
she
had
,
or
what
the
price
of
anything
in
it
was
;
but
there
was
a
little
*NL*
greasy
memorandum-book
kept
in
a
drawer
,
which
served
as
a
Catalogue
*NL*
of
Prices
,
and
by
this
oracle
Biddy
arranged
all
the
shop
transactions
.
*NL*
Biddy
was
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
's
granddaughter
;
I
confess
myself
*NL*
quite
unequal
to
the
working
out
of
the
problem
,
what
relation
she
was
*NL*
to
Mr.
Wopsle
.
She
was
an
orphan
like
myself
;
like
me
,
too
,
had
been
*NL*
brought
up
by
hand
.
She
was
most
noticeable
,
I
thought
,
in
respect
of
*NL*
her
extremities
;
for
,
her
hair
always
wanted
brushing
,
her
hands
always
*NL*
wanted
washing
,
and
her
shoes
always
wanted
mending
and
pulling
up
at
*NL*
heel
.
This
description
must
be
received
with
a
week-day
limitation
.
On
*NL*
Sundays
,
she
went
to
church
elaborated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
of
my
unassisted
self
,
and
more
by
the
help
of
Biddy
than
of
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
,
I
struggled
through
the
alphabet
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
a
bramble-bush
;
getting
considerably
worried
and
scratched
by
every
*NL*
letter
.
After
that
I
fell
among
those
thieves
,
the
nine
figures
,
who
*NL*
seemed
every
evening
to
do
something
new
to
disguise
themselves
and
*NL*
baffle
recognition
.
But
,
at
last
I
began
,
in
a
purblind
groping
way
,
to
*NL*
read
,
write
,
and
cipher
,
on
the
very
smallest
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
I
was
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
with
my
slate
,
expending
*NL*
great
efforts
on
the
production
of
a
letter
to
Joe
.
I
think
it
must
have
*NL*
been
a
full
year
after
our
hunt
upon
the
marshes
,
for
it
was
a
long
*NL*
time
after
,
and
it
was
winter
and
a
hard
frost
.
With
an
alphabet
on
the
*NL*
hearth
at
my
feet
for
reference
,
I
contrived
in
an
hour
or
two
to
print
*NL*
and
smear
this
epistle
:
--
*NL*
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
indispensable
necessity
for
my
communicating
with
Joe
by
*NL*
letter
,
inasmuch
as
he
sat
beside
me
and
we
were
alone
.
But
I
delivered
*NL*
this
written
communication
-LRB-
slate
and
all
-RRB-
with
my
own
hand
,
and
Joe
*NL*
received
it
as
a
miracle
of
erudition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Pip
,
old
chap
!
''
cried
Joe
,
opening
his
blue
eyes
wide
,
``
what
a
*NL*
scholar
you
are
!
A
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
be
,
''
said
I
,
glancing
at
the
slate
as
he
held
it
;
with
*NL*
a
misgiving
that
the
writing
was
rather
hilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
here
's
a
J
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
and
a
O
equal
to
anythink
!
Here
's
a
J
and
*NL*
a
O
,
Pip
,
and
a
J-O
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
heard
Joe
read
aloud
to
any
greater
extent
than
this
*NL*
monosyllable
,
and
I
had
observed
at
church
last
Sunday
,
when
I
*NL*
accidentally
held
our
Prayer-Book
upside
down
,
that
it
seemed
to
suit
*NL*
his
convenience
quite
as
well
as
if
it
had
been
all
right
.
Wishing
to
*NL*
embrace
the
present
occasion
of
finding
out
whether
in
teaching
Joe
,
I
*NL*
should
have
to
begin
quite
at
the
beginning
,
I
said
,
``
Ah
!
But
read
the
*NL*
rest
,
Jo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rest
,
eh
,
Pip
?
''
said
Joe
,
looking
at
it
with
a
slow
,
searching
eye
,
*NL*
``
One
,
two
,
three
.
Why
,
here
's
three
Js
,
and

Os
,
and

J-O
,
*NL*
Joes

it
,
Pip

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
leaned
over
Joe
,
and
,
with
the
aid
of
my
forefinger
read
him
the
whole
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Astonishing
!
''
said
Joe
,
when
I
had
finished
.
``
You
ARE
a
scholar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
spell
Gargery
,
Joe
?
''
I
asked
him
,
with
a
modest
patronage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
spell
it
at
all
,
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
supposing
you
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
be
supposed
,
''
said
Joe
.
``
Tho
'
I
'm
uncommon
fond
of
reading
,
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
,
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On-common
.
Give
me
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
a
good
book
,
or
a
good
newspaper
,
and
*NL*
sit
me
down
afore
a
good
fire
,
and
I
ask
no
better
.
Lord
!
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
after
rubbing
his
knees
a
little
,
``
when
you
do
come
to
a
J
and
a
O

and
*NL*
says

Here

,
is
a
J-O
,
Joe
,
'
how
interesting
reading
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
derived
from
this
,
that
Joe
's
education
,
like
Steam
,
was
yet
in
its
*NL*
infancy
.
Pursuing
the
subject
,
I
inquired
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
ever
go
to
school
,
Joe
,
when
you
were
as
little
as
me
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

when
you
were
as
little

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
,
taking
up
the
poker
,
and
settling
himself
to
*NL*
his
usual
occupation
when
he
was
thoughtful
,
of
slowly
raking
the
fire
*NL*
between
the
lower
bars
;
``
I
'll
tell
you
.
My
father
,
Pip
,
he
were
given
*NL*
to
drink
,
and
when
he
were
overtook
with
drink
,
he
hammered
away
at
*NL*
my
mother
,
most
onmerciful
.
It
were
a
`
most
the
only
hammering
he
did
,
*NL*
indeed
,
`
xcepting
at
myself
.
And
he
hammered
at
me
with
a
wigor
only
*NL*
to
be
equalled
by
the
wigor
with
which
he
did
n't
hammer
at
his
*NL*
anwil

You
're
a
listening
and
understanding
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Consequence
,
my
mother
and
me
we
ran
away
from
my
father
several
*NL*
times
;
and
then
my
mother
she
'd
go
out
to
work
,
and
she
'd
say
,
``
Joe
,
''
*NL*
she
'd
say
,
``
now
,
please
God
,
you
shall
have
some
schooling
,
child
,
''
and
*NL*
she
'd
put
me
to
school
.
But
my
father
were
that
good
in
his
hart
that
*NL*
he
could
n't
abear
to
be
without
us
.
So
,
he
'd
come
with
a
most
tremenjous
*NL*
crowd
and
make
such
a
row
at
the
doors
of
the
houses
where
we
was
,
that
*NL*
they
used
to
be
obligated
to
have
no
more
to
do
with
us
and
to
give
us
*NL*
up
to
him
.
And
then
he
took
us
home
and
hammered
us
.
Which
,
you
see
,
*NL*
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
,
pausing
in
his
meditative
raking
of
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
looking
at
me
,
``
were
a
drawback
on
my
learning

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
poor
Joe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
mind
you

''
said
Joe
,
with
a
judicial
touch
or
two
of
the
*NL*
poker
on
the
top
bar
,
``
rendering
unto
all
their
doo

and
maintaining

*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
see
;
but
I
did
n't
say
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Joe
pursued
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
that
,
and
said
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Consequence
,
my
father
did
n't
make
objections
to
my
going
to
work
;
so
*NL*
I
went
to
work
at
my
present
calling
,
which
were
his
too
,
if
he
*NL*
would
have
followed
it
,
and
I
worked
tolerable
hard
,
I
assure
you
,
Pip
.
*NL*
In
time
I
were
able
to
keep
him
,
and
I
kep
him
till
he
went
off
in
a
*NL*
purple
leptic
fit
.
And
it
were
my
intentions
to
have
had
put
upon
his
*NL*
tombstone
that
,
Whatsume'er
the
failings
on
his
part
,
Remember
reader
he
*NL*
were
that
good
in
his
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
recited
this
couplet
with
such
manifest
pride
and
careful
*NL*
perspicuity
,
that
I
asked
him
if
he
had
made
it
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
it
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
my
own
self
.
I
made
it
in
a
moment
.
It
was
like
*NL*
striking
out
a
horseshoe
complete
,
in
a
single
blow
.
I
never
was
so
much
*NL*
surprised
in
all
my
life
,
--
could
n't
credit
my
own
ed
,
--
to
tell
you
the
*NL*
truth
,
hardly
believed
it
were
my
own
ed
.
As
I
was
saying
,
Pip
,
it
were
*NL*
my
intentions
to
have
had
it
cut
over
him
;
but
poetry
costs
money
,
cut
*NL*
it
how
you
will
,
small
or
large
,
and
it
were
not
done
.
Not
to
mention
*NL*
bearers
,
all
the
money
that
could
be
spared
were
wanted
for
my
mother
.
*NL*
She
were
in
poor
elth
,
and
quite
broke
.
She
were
n't
long
of
following

poor
soul

her
share
of
peace
come
round
at
last

*NL*
*NL*
Joe
's
blue
eyes
turned
a
little
watery
;
he
rubbed
first
one
of
them
,
and
*NL*
then
the
other
,
in
a
most
uncongenial
and
uncomfortable
manner
,
with
the
*NL*
round
knob
on
the
top
of
the
poker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
were
but
lonesome
then
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
living
here
alone
,
and
I
got
*NL*
acquainted
with
your
sister

Now
,
Pip
,
''
--
Joe
looked
firmly
at
me
as
*NL*
if
he
knew
I
was
not
going
to
agree
with
him
;
--
``
your
sister
is
a
fine
*NL*
figure
of
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
looking
at
the
fire
,
in
an
obvious
state
of
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever

Joe
tapped
the
top
bar
with
the
*NL*
poker
after
every
word
following
,
``
a-fine-figure
--
of
--
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
say
than
``
I
am
glad
you
think
so
,
*NL*
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I

returned
Joe
,
catching
me
up
.
``
I
am
glad
I
think
so

A
*NL*
little
redness
or
a
little
matter
of
Bone

here
or
there
,
what
does
it
*NL*
signify
to
Me

*NL*
*NL*
I
sagaciously
observed
,
if
it
did
n't
signify
to
him
,
to
whom
did
it
*NL*
signify
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
!

assented
Joe
.
``
That
's
it
.
You
're
right

When
I

got
acquainted
with

it
were
the
talk
how
she
was
bringing
*NL*
you
up
by
hand

Very
kind
of
her
too
,
all
the
folks
said
,
and
I
said
,
*NL*
along
with
all
the
folks
.
As
to
you
,
''
Joe
pursued
with
a
countenance
*NL*
expressive
of
seeing
something
very
nasty
indeed
,
``
if
you
could
have
*NL*
been
aware
how
small

flabby

mean
you

'd
have
*NL*
formed
the
most
contemptible
opinion
of
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
exactly
relishing
this
,
I
said
,
``
Never
mind
me
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
did
mind
you

he
returned
with
tender
simplicity
.
``
When
*NL*
I
offered
to
your
sister
to
keep
company
,
and
to
be
asked
in
church
at
*NL*
such
times
as
she
was
willing
and
ready
to
come
to
the
forge
,
I
said
to
*NL*
her
,
`
And
bring
the
poor
little

God
bless
the
poor
little
child

*NL*
I
said
to
your
sister
,
`
there
's
room
for
him
at
the
forge

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
broke
out
crying
and
begging
pardon
,
and
hugged
Joe
round
the
neck
:
*NL*
who
dropped
the
poker
to
hug
me
,
and
to
say
,
``
Ever
the
best
of
friends

*NL*
a
n't
us

Pip
?
Do
n't
cry
,

*NL*
*NL*
When
this
little
interruption
was
over
,
Joe
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
Pip

here
we

That
's
about

I
tell
*NL*
you
beforehand

am
awful

most
awful
dull

Mrs.
Joe
must
n't
see
*NL*
too
much
of
what
we
're
up
to

It
must
be
done
,
as
I
may
say
,
on
the
sly
.
*NL*
And
why
on
the
sly
?
I
'll
tell
you
why
,
Pip

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
taken
up
the
poker
again
;
without
which
,
I
doubt
if
he
could
have
*NL*
proceeded
in
his
demonstration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
is
given
to
government

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Given
to
government
,
Joe
?
''
I
was
startled
,
for
I
had
some
shadowy
idea
*NL*
-LRB-
and
I
am
afraid
I
must
add
,
hope
-RRB-
that
Joe
had
divorced
her
in
a
favor
*NL*
of
the
Lords
of
the
Admiralty
,
or
Treasury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Given

said
Joe
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
a
n't
over
partial

on

Joe
*NL*
continued
,
``
and
in
partickler
would
not
be
over
partial
to
my
being
a
*NL*
scholar

for

as
I
might
rise
.
Like
a
sort
of
rebel
,
do
n't
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
to
retort
with
an
inquiry
,
and
had
got
as
far
as
``
Why
--
''
*NL*
when
Joe
stopped
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
a
bit

I
know
what

going

do
n't
*NL*
deny
that
your

comes
the
Mo-gul
over
us

now
and
again

I
do
n't
*NL*
deny
that
she
do
throw
us
back-falls
,
and
that
she
do
drop
down
upon
us
*NL*
heavy
.
At
such
times
as
when
your
sister
is
on
the
Ram-page
,
Pip
,
''
Joe
*NL*
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
glanced
at
the
door
,
``
candor
compels
fur
*NL*
to
admit
that
she
is
a
Buster
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
pronounced
this
word
,
as
if
it
began
with
at
least
twelve
capital
*NL*
Bs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
I
rise

That
were
your
observation

I
broke
it
off
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Joe
,
passing
the
poker
into
his
left
hand
,
that
he
might
*NL*
feel
his
whisker
;
and
I
had
no
hope
of
him
whenever
he
took
to
that
*NL*
placid
occupation
;
``
your
sister
's
a
master-mind
.
A
master-mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
I
asked
,
in
some
hope
of
bringing
him
to
a
stand
.
But
*NL*
Joe
was
readier
with
his
definition
than
I
had
expected
,
and
completely
*NL*
stopped
me
by
arguing
circularly
,
and
answering
with
a
fixed
look
,
*NL*
``
Her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
ai
n't
a
master-mind
,
''
Joe
resumed
,
when
he
had
unfixed
his
look
,
*NL*
and
got
back
to
his
whisker
.
``
And
last
of
all
,
Pip
,
--
and
this
I
want
to
*NL*
say
very
serious
to
you
,
old
chap
,
--
I
see
so
much
in
my
poor
mother
,
*NL*
of
a
woman
drudging
and
slaving
and
breaking
her
honest
hart
and
never
*NL*
getting
no
peace
in
her
mortal
days
,
that
I
'm
dead
afeerd
of
going
wrong
*NL*
in
the
way
of
not
doing
what
's
right
by
a
woman
,
and
I
'd
fur
rather
*NL*
of
the
two
go
wrong
the
t
`
other
way
,
and
be
a
little
ill-conwenienced
*NL*
myself
.
I
wish
it
was
only
me
that
got
put
out
,
Pip
;
I
wish
there
war
n't
*NL*
no
Tickler
for
you
,
old
chap
;
I
wish
I
could
take
it
all
on
myself
;
*NL*
but
this
is
the
up-and-down-and-straight
on
it
,
Pip
,
and
I
hope
you
'll
*NL*
overlook
shortcomings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Young
as
I
was
,
I
believe
that
I
dated
a
new
admiration
of
Joe
from
that
*NL*
night
.
We
were
equals
afterwards
,
as
we
had
been
before
;
but
,
afterwards
*NL*
at
quiet
times
when
I
sat
looking
at
Joe
and
thinking
about
him
,
I
had
*NL*
a
new
sensation
of
feeling
conscious
that
I
was
looking
up
to
Joe
in
my
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
''
said
Joe
,
rising
to
replenish
the
fire
;
``
here
's
the
*NL*
Dutch-clock
a
working
himself
up
to
being
equal
to
strike
Eight
of
'em
,
*NL*
and
she
's
not
come
home
yet
!
I
hope
Uncle
Pumblechook
's
mare
may
n't
have
*NL*
set
a
forefoot
on
a
piece
o
'
ice
,
and
gone
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Joe
made
occasional
trips
with
Uncle
Pumblechook
on
market-days
,
*NL*
to
assist
him
in
buying
such
household
stuffs
and
goods
as
required
a
*NL*
woman
's
judgment
;
Uncle
Pumblechook
being
a
bachelor
and
reposing
no
*NL*
confidences
in
his
domestic
servant
.
This
was
market-day
,
and
Mrs.
Joe
*NL*
was
out
on
one
of
these
expeditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
made
the
fire
and
swept
the
hearth
,
and
then
we
went
to
the
door
to
*NL*
listen
for
the
chaise-cart
.
It
was
a
dry
cold
night
,
and
the
wind
blew
*NL*
keenly
,
and
the
frost
was
white
and
hard
.
A
man
would
die
to-night
of
*NL*
lying
out
on
the
marshes
,
I
thought
.
And
then
I
looked
at
the
stars
,
and
*NL*
considered
how
awful
it
would
be
for
a
man
to
turn
his
face
up
to
them
*NL*
as
he
froze
to
death
,
and
see
no
help
or
pity
in
all
the
glittering
*NL*
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
comes
the
mare
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
ringing
like
a
peal
of
bells
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
her
iron
shoes
upon
the
hard
road
was
quite
musical
,
as
she
*NL*
came
along
at
a
much
brisker
trot
than
usual
.
We
got
a
chair
out
,
ready
*NL*
for
Mrs.
Joe
's
alighting
,
and
stirred
up
the
fire
that
they
might
see
a
*NL*
bright
window
,
and
took
a
final
survey
of
the
kitchen
that
nothing
might
*NL*
be
out
of
its
place
.
When
we
had
completed
these
preparations
,
they
*NL*
drove
up
,
wrapped
to
the
eyes
.
Mrs.
Joe
was
soon
landed
,
and
Uncle
*NL*
Pumblechook
was
soon
down
too
,
covering
the
mare
with
a
cloth
,
and
we
*NL*
were
soon
all
in
the
kitchen
,
carrying
so
much
cold
air
in
with
us
that
*NL*
it
seemed
to
drive
all
the
heat
out
of
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Mrs.
Joe
,
unwrapping
herself
with
haste
and
excitement
,
and
*NL*
throwing
her
bonnet
back
on
her
shoulders
where
it
hung
by
the
strings
,
*NL*
``
if
this
boy
ai
n't
grateful
this
night
,
he
never
will
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
as
grateful
as
any
boy
possibly
could
,
who
was
wholly
*NL*
uninformed
why
he
ought
to
assume
that
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
to
be
hoped
,
''
said
my
sister
,
``
that
he
wo
n't
be
Pompeyed
.
But
*NL*
I
have
my
fears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ai
n't
in
that
line
,
Mum
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
.
``
She
knows
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
?
I
looked
at
Joe
,
making
the
motion
with
my
lips
and
eyebrows
,
*NL*
``
She
?
''
Joe
looked
at
me
,
making
the
motion
with
his
lips
and
eyebrows
,
*NL*
``
She
?
''
My
sister
catching
him
in
the
act
,
he
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
*NL*
across
his
nose
with
his
usual
conciliatory
air
on
such
occasions
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
my
sister
,
in
her
snappish
way
.
``
What
are
you
staring
at
?
*NL*
Is
the
house
afire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Which
some
individual
,

Joe
politely
hinted
,
``
mentioned
--
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
is
a
she
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
my
sister
.
``
Unless
you
call
Miss
*NL*
Havisham

he

And
I
doubt
if
even
you
'll
go
so
far
as
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Havisham

up
town

said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
Miss
Havisham
down
town
?

returned
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wants
this
boy
to
go
and
play
there

And
of
course
he
's
going

And
*NL*
he
had
better
play
there
,
''
said
my
sister
,
shaking
her
head
at
me
as
an
*NL*
encouragement
to
be
extremely
light
and
sportive
,
``
or
I
'll
work
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
heard
of
Miss
Havisham
up
town
,
--
everybody
for
miles
round
had
*NL*
heard
of
Miss
Havisham
up
town
,
--
as
an
immensely
rich
and
grim
lady
who
*NL*
lived
in
a
large
and
dismal
house
barricaded
against
robbers
,
and
who
*NL*
led
a
life
of
seclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
to
be
sure
!
''
said
Joe
,
astounded
.
``
I
wonder
how
she
come
to
know
*NL*
Pip
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Noodle
!
''
cried
my
sister
.
``
Who
said
she
knew
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Which
some
individual
,
''
Joe
again
politely
hinted
,
``
mentioned
that
*NL*
she
wanted
him
to
go
and
play
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
could
n't
she
ask
Uncle
Pumblechook
if
he
knew
of
a
boy
to
go
and
*NL*
play
there
?
Is
n't
it
just
barely
possible
that
Uncle
Pumblechook
may
be
*NL*
a
tenant
of
hers
,
and
that
he
may
sometimes
--
we
wo
n't
say
quarterly
*NL*
or
half-yearly
,
for
that
would
be
requiring
too
much
of
you
--
but
*NL*
sometimes
--
go
there
to
pay
his
rent
?
And
could
n't
she
then
ask
Uncle
*NL*
Pumblechook
if
he
knew
of
a
boy
to
go
and
play
there
?
And
could
n't
Uncle
*NL*
Pumblechook
,
being
always
considerate
and
thoughtful
for
us
--
though
you
*NL*
may
not
think
it
,
Joseph
,
''
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
reproach
,
as
if
*NL*
he
were
the
most
callous
of
nephews
,
``
then
mention
this
boy
,
standing
*NL*
Prancing
here
''
--
which
I
solemnly
declare
I
was
not
doing
--
``
that
I
have
*NL*
for
ever
been
a
willing
slave
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
again
!
''
cried
Uncle
Pumblechook
.
``
Well
put
!
Prettily
pointed
!
Good
*NL*
indeed
!
Now
Joseph
,
you
know
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Joseph
,
''
said
my
sister
,
still
in
a
reproachful
manner
,
while
Joe
*NL*
apologetically
drew
the
back
of
his
hand
across
and
across
his
nose
,
*NL*
``
you
do
not
yet
--
though
you
may
not
think
it
--
know
the
case

You
may
*NL*
consider
that
you
do
,
but
you
do
not
,
Joseph
.
For
you
do
not
know
that
*NL*
Uncle
Pumblechook
,
being
sensible
that
for
anything
we
can
tell
,
this
*NL*
boy
's
fortune
may
be
made
by
his
going
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
has
offered
*NL*
to
take
him
into
town
to-night
in
his
own
chaise-cart
,
and
to
keep
*NL*
him
to-night
,
and
to
take
him
with
his
own
hands
to
Miss
Havisham
's
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
.
And
Lor-a-mussy
me
!
''
cried
my
sister
,
casting
off
her
*NL*
bonnet
in
sudden
desperation
,
``
here
I
stand
talking
to
mere
Mooncalfs
,
*NL*
with
Uncle
Pumblechook
waiting
,
and
the
mare
catching
cold
at
the
door
,
*NL*
and
the
boy
grimed
with
crock
and
dirt
from
the
hair
of
his
head
to
the
*NL*
sole
of
his
foot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
she
pounced
upon
me
,
like
an
eagle
on
a
lamb
,
and
my
face
was
*NL*
squeezed
into
wooden
bowls
in
sinks
,
and
my
head
was
put
under
taps
of
*NL*
water-butts
,
and
I
was
soaped
,
and
kneaded
,
and
towelled
,
and
thumped
,
*NL*
and
harrowed
,
and
rasped
,
until
I
really
was
quite
beside
myself
.
-LRB-
I
*NL*
may
here
remark
that
I
suppose
myself
to
be
better
acquainted
than
*NL*
any
living
authority
,
with
the
ridgy
effect
of
a
wedding-ring
,
passing
*NL*
unsympathetically
over
the
human
countenance
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
ablutions
were
completed
,
I
was
put
into
clean
linen
of
the
*NL*
stiffest
character
,
like
a
young
penitent
into
sackcloth
,
and
was
*NL*
trussed
up
in
my
tightest
and
fearfullest
suit
.
I
was
then
delivered
*NL*
over
to
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
who
formally
received
me
as
if
he
were
the
*NL*
Sheriff
,
and
who
let
off
upon
me
the
speech
that
I
knew
he
had
been
*NL*
dying
to
make
all
along
:
``
Boy
,
be
forever
grateful
to
all
friends
,
but
*NL*
especially
unto
them
which
brought
you
up
by
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Joe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
Pip
,
old
chap
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
parted
from
him
before
,
and
what
with
my
feelings
and
what
*NL*
with
soapsuds
,
I
could
at
first
see
no
stars
from
the
chaise-cart
.
*NL*
But
they
twinkled
out
one
by
one
,
without
throwing
any
light
on
the
*NL*
questions
why
on
earth
I
was
going
to
play
at
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
what
*NL*
on
earth
I
was
expected
to
play
at
.

Chapter
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
premises
in
the
High
Street
of
the
market
town
,
*NL*
were
of
a
peppercorny
and
farinaceous
character
,
as
the
premises
of
a
*NL*
cornchandler
and
seedsman
should
be
.
It
appeared
to
me
that
he
must
be
a
*NL*
very
happy
man
indeed
,
to
have
so
many
little
drawers
in
his
shop
;
and
*NL*
I
wondered
when
I
peeped
into
one
or
two
on
the
lower
tiers
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
tied-up
brown
paper
packets
inside
,
whether
the
flower-seeds
and
bulbs
*NL*
ever
wanted
of
a
fine
day
to
break
out
of
those
jails
,
and
bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
early
morning
after
my
arrival
that
I
entertained
this
*NL*
speculation
.
On
the
previous
night
,
I
had
been
sent
straight
to
bed
in
*NL*
an
attic
with
a
sloping
roof
,
which
was
so
low
in
the
corner
where
the
*NL*
bedstead
was
,
that
I
calculated
the
tiles
as
being
within
a
foot
of
my
*NL*
eyebrows
.
In
the
same
early
morning
,
I
discovered
a
singular
affinity
*NL*
between
seeds
and
corduroys
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
wore
corduroys
,
and
so
did
*NL*
his
shopman
;
and
somehow
,
there
was
a
general
air
and
flavor
about
the
*NL*
corduroys
,
so
much
in
the
nature
of
seeds
,
and
a
general
air
and
flavor
*NL*
about
the
seeds
,
so
much
in
the
nature
of
corduroys
,
that
I
hardly
knew
*NL*
which
was
which
.
The
same
opportunity
served
me
for
noticing
that
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
appeared
to
conduct
his
business
by
looking
across
the
*NL*
street
at
the
saddler
,
who
appeared
to
transact
his
business
by
keeping
*NL*
his
eye
on
the
coachmaker
,
who
appeared
to
get
on
in
life
by
putting
his
*NL*
hands
in
his
pockets
and
contemplating
the
baker
,
who
in
his
turn
folded
*NL*
his
arms
and
stared
at
the
grocer
,
who
stood
at
his
door
and
yawned
at
*NL*
the
chemist
.
The
watchmaker
,
always
poring
over
a
little
desk
with
*NL*
a
magnifying-glass
at
his
eye
,
and
always
inspected
by
a
group
of
*NL*
smock-frocks
poring
over
him
through
the
glass
of
his
shop-window
,
*NL*
seemed
to
be
about
the
only
person
in
the
High
Street
whose
trade
*NL*
engaged
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
and
I
breakfasted
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
parlor
behind
*NL*
the
shop
,
while
the
shopman
took
his
mug
of
tea
and
hunch
of
bread
*NL*
and
butter
on
a
sack
of
peas
in
the
front
premises
.
I
considered
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
wretched
company
.
Besides
being
possessed
by
my
sister
's
*NL*
idea
that
a
mortifying
and
penitential
character
ought
to
be
imparted
*NL*
to
my
diet
,
--
besides
giving
me
as
much
crumb
as
possible
in
combination
*NL*
with
as
little
butter
,
and
putting
such
a
quantity
of
warm
water
into
*NL*
my
milk
that
it
would
have
been
more
candid
to
have
left
the
milk
out
*NL*
altogether
,
--
his
conversation
consisted
of
nothing
but
arithmetic
.
On
*NL*
my
politely
bidding
him
Good
morning
,
he
said
,
pompously
,
``
Seven
times
*NL*
nine
,
boy
?
''
And
how
should
I
be
able
to
answer
,
dodged
in
that
way
,
in
*NL*
a
strange
place
,
on
an
empty
stomach
!
I
was
hungry
,
but
before
I
had
*NL*
swallowed
a
morsel
,
he
began
a
running
sum
that
lasted
all
through
the
*NL*
breakfast
.
``
Seven
?
''
``
And
four
?
''
``
And
eight
?
''
``
And
six
?
''
``
And
two
?
''
``
And
*NL*
ten
?
''
And
so
on
.
And
after
each
figure
was
disposed
of
,
it
was
as
much
*NL*
as
I
could
do
to
get
a
bite
or
a
sup
,
before
the
next
came
;
while
he
sat
*NL*
at
his
ease
guessing
nothing
,
and
eating
bacon
and
hot
roll
,
in
-LRB-
if
I
*NL*
may
be
allowed
the
expression
-RRB-
a
gorging
and
gormandizing
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
such
reasons
,
I
was
very
glad
when
ten
o'clock
came
and
we
started
*NL*
for
Miss
Havisham
's
;
though
I
was
not
at
all
at
my
ease
regarding
the
*NL*
manner
in
which
I
should
acquit
myself
under
that
lady
's
roof
.
Within
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
came
to
Miss
Havisham
's
house
,
which
was
of
old
*NL*
brick
,
and
dismal
,
and
had
a
great
many
iron
bars
to
it
.
Some
of
the
*NL*
windows
had
been
walled
up
;
of
those
that
remained
,
all
the
lower
were
*NL*
rustily
barred
.
There
was
a
courtyard
in
front
,
and
that
was
barred
;
so
*NL*
we
had
to
wait
,
after
ringing
the
bell
,
until
some
one
should
come
*NL*
to
open
it
.
While
we
waited
at
the
gate
,
I
peeped
in
-LRB-
even
then
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
said
,
``
And
fourteen
?
''
but
I
pretended
not
to
hear
him
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
saw
that
at
the
side
of
the
house
there
was
a
large
brewery
.
No
brewing
*NL*
was
going
on
in
it
,
and
none
seemed
to
have
gone
on
for
a
long
long
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
window
was
raised
,
and
a
clear
voice
demanded
``
What
name
?
''
To
which
my
*NL*
conductor
replied
,
``
Pumblechook
.
''
The
voice
returned
,
``
Quite
right
,
''
and
*NL*
the
window
was
shut
again
,
and
a
young
lady
came
across
the
court-yard
,
*NL*
with
keys
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
``
is
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Pip
,
is
it
?
''
returned
the
young
lady
,
who
was
very
pretty
and
*NL*
seemed
very
proud
;
``
come
in
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
was
coming
in
also
,
when
she
stopped
him
with
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
said
.
``
Did
you
wish
to
see
Miss
Havisham
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Miss
Havisham
wished
to
see
me
,
''
returned
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
*NL*
discomfited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
girl
;
``
but
you
see
she
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
it
so
finally
,
and
in
such
an
undiscussible
way
,
that
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
,
though
in
a
condition
of
ruffled
dignity
,
could
not
*NL*
protest
.
But
he
eyed
me
severely
,
--
as
if
I
had
done
anything
to
*NL*
him
!
--
and
departed
with
the
words
reproachfully
delivered
:
``
Boy
!
Let
*NL*
your
behavior
here
be
a
credit
unto
them
which
brought
you
up
by
hand
!
''
*NL*
I
was
not
free
from
apprehension
that
he
would
come
back
to
propound
*NL*
through
the
gate
,
``
And
sixteen
?
''
But
he
did
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
young
conductress
locked
the
gate
,
and
we
went
across
the
courtyard
.
*NL*
It
was
paved
and
clean
,
but
grass
was
growing
in
every
crevice
.
The
*NL*
brewery
buildings
had
a
little
lane
of
communication
with
it
,
and
the
*NL*
wooden
gates
of
that
lane
stood
open
,
and
all
the
brewery
beyond
stood
*NL*
open
,
away
to
the
high
enclosing
wall
;
and
all
was
empty
and
disused
.
*NL*
The
cold
wind
seemed
to
blow
colder
there
than
outside
the
gate
;
and
*NL*
it
made
a
shrill
noise
in
howling
in
and
out
at
the
open
sides
of
the
*NL*
brewery
,
like
the
noise
of
wind
in
the
rigging
of
a
ship
at
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
me
looking
at
it
,
and
she
said
,
``
You
could
drink
without
hurt
*NL*
all
the
strong
beer
that
's
brewed
there
now
,
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
I
could
,
miss
,
''
said
I
,
in
a
shy
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
not
try
to
brew
beer
there
now
,
or
it
would
turn
out
sour
,
boy
;
*NL*
do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
like
it
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
anybody
means
to
try
,
''
she
added
,
``
for
that
's
all
done
with
,
*NL*
and
the
place
will
stand
as
idle
as
it
is
till
it
falls
.
As
to
strong
*NL*
beer
,
there
's
enough
of
it
in
the
cellars
already
,
to
drown
the
Manor
*NL*
House
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
name
of
this
house
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
its
names
,
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
more
than
one
,
then
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
more
.
Its
other
name
was
Satis
;
which
is
Greek
,
or
Latin
,
or
*NL*
Hebrew
,
or
all
three
--
or
all
one
to
me
--
for
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
House
,
''
said
I
;
``
that
's
a
curious
name
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
;
``
but
it
meant
more
than
it
said
.
It
meant
,
when
it
*NL*
was
given
,
that
whoever
had
this
house
could
want
nothing
else
.
They
*NL*
must
have
been
easily
satisfied
in
those
days
,
I
should
think
.
But
do
n't
*NL*
loiter
,
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
called
me
``
boy
''
so
often
,
and
with
a
carelessness
that
was
*NL*
far
from
complimentary
,
she
was
of
about
my
own
age
.
She
seemed
much
*NL*
older
than
I
,
of
course
,
being
a
girl
,
and
beautiful
and
self-possessed
;
*NL*
and
she
was
as
scornful
of
me
as
if
she
had
been
one-and-twenty
,
and
a
*NL*
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
into
the
house
by
a
side
door
,
the
great
front
entrance
had
two
*NL*
chains
across
it
outside
,
--
and
the
first
thing
I
noticed
was
,
that
the
*NL*
passages
were
all
dark
,
and
that
she
had
left
a
candle
burning
there
.
*NL*
She
took
it
up
,
and
we
went
through
more
passages
and
up
a
staircase
,
*NL*
and
still
it
was
all
dark
,
and
only
the
candle
lighted
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
we
came
to
the
door
of
a
room
,
and
she
said
,
``
Go
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
more
in
shyness
than
politeness
,
``
After
you
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
she
returned
:
``
Do
n't
be
ridiculous
,
boy
;
I
am
not
going
in
.
''
And
*NL*
scornfully
walked
away
,
and
--
what
was
worse
--
took
the
candle
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
very
uncomfortable
,
and
I
was
half
afraid
.
However
,
the
only
*NL*
thing
to
be
done
being
to
knock
at
the
door
,
I
knocked
,
and
was
told
*NL*
from
within
to
enter
.
I
entered
,
therefore
,
and
found
myself
in
a
pretty
*NL*
large
room
,
well
lighted
with
wax
candles
.
No
glimpse
of
daylight
was
to
*NL*
be
seen
in
it
.
It
was
a
dressing-room
,
as
I
supposed
from
the
furniture
,
*NL*
though
much
of
it
was
of
forms
and
uses
then
quite
unknown
to
me
.
But
*NL*
prominent
in
it
was
a
draped
table
with
a
gilded
looking-glass
,
and
that
*NL*
I
made
out
at
first
sight
to
be
a
fine
lady
's
dressing-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
I
should
have
made
out
this
object
so
soon
if
there
had
been
no
*NL*
fine
lady
sitting
at
it
,
I
can
not
say
.
In
an
arm-chair
,
with
an
*NL*
elbow
resting
on
the
table
and
her
head
leaning
on
that
hand
,
sat
the
*NL*
strangest
lady
I
have
ever
seen
,
or
shall
ever
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
dressed
in
rich
materials
,
--
satins
,
and
lace
,
and
silks
,
--
all
*NL*
of
white
.
Her
shoes
were
white
.
And
she
had
a
long
white
veil
dependent
*NL*
from
her
hair
,
and
she
had
bridal
flowers
in
her
hair
,
but
her
hair
was
*NL*
white
.
Some
bright
jewels
sparkled
on
her
neck
and
on
her
hands
,
and
*NL*
some
other
jewels
lay
sparkling
on
the
table
.
Dresses
,
less
splendid
*NL*
than
the
dress
she
wore
,
and
half-packed
trunks
,
were
scattered
about
.
*NL*
She
had
not
quite
finished
dressing
,
for
she
had
but
one
shoe
on
,
--
the
*NL*
other
was
on
the
table
near
her
hand
,
--
her
veil
was
but
half
arranged
,
*NL*
her
watch
and
chain
were
not
put
on
,
and
some
lace
for
her
bosom
lay
*NL*
with
those
trinkets
,
and
with
her
handkerchief
,
and
gloves
,
and
*NL*
some
flowers
,
and
a
Prayer-Book
all
confusedly
heaped
about
the
*NL*
looking-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
in
the
first
few
moments
that
I
saw
all
these
things
,
though
*NL*
I
saw
more
of
them
in
the
first
moments
than
might
be
supposed
.
But
I
*NL*
saw
that
everything
within
my
view
which
ought
to
be
white
,
had
been
*NL*
white
long
ago
,
and
had
lost
its
lustre
and
was
faded
and
yellow
.
I
saw
*NL*
that
the
bride
within
the
bridal
dress
had
withered
like
the
dress
,
and
*NL*
like
the
flowers
,
and
had
no
brightness
left
but
the
brightness
of
her
*NL*
sunken
eyes
.
I
saw
that
the
dress
had
been
put
upon
the
rounded
figure
*NL*
of
a
young
woman
,
and
that
the
figure
upon
which
it
now
hung
loose
had
*NL*
shrunk
to
skin
and
bone
.
Once
,
I
had
been
taken
to
see
some
ghastly
*NL*
waxwork
at
the
Fair
,
representing
I
know
not
what
impossible
personage
*NL*
lying
in
state
.
Once
,
I
had
been
taken
to
one
of
our
old
marsh
churches
*NL*
to
see
a
skeleton
in
the
ashes
of
a
rich
dress
that
had
been
dug
out
of
*NL*
a
vault
under
the
church
pavement
.
Now
,
waxwork
and
skeleton
seemed
to
*NL*
have
dark
eyes
that
moved
and
looked
at
me
.
I
should
have
cried
out
,
if
*NL*
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
?
''
said
the
lady
at
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
boy
,
ma'am
.
Come
--
to
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
nearer
;
let
me
look
at
you
.
Come
close
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
when
I
stood
before
her
,
avoiding
her
eyes
,
that
I
took
note
of
*NL*
the
surrounding
objects
in
detail
,
and
saw
that
her
watch
had
stopped
*NL*
at
twenty
minutes
to
nine
,
and
that
a
clock
in
the
room
had
stopped
at
*NL*
twenty
minutes
to
nine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
me
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
.
``
You
are
not
afraid
of
a
woman
who
has
*NL*
never
seen
the
sun
since
you
were
born
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
regret
to
state
that
I
was
not
afraid
of
telling
the
enormous
lie
*NL*
comprehended
in
the
answer
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
I
touch
here
?
''
she
said
,
laying
her
hands
,
one
upon
*NL*
the
other
,
on
her
left
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
''
-LRB-
It
made
me
think
of
the
young
man
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
touch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Broken
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
uttered
the
word
with
an
eager
look
,
and
with
strong
emphasis
,
and
*NL*
with
a
weird
smile
that
had
a
kind
of
boast
in
it
.
Afterwards
she
kept
*NL*
her
hands
there
for
a
little
while
,
and
slowly
took
them
away
as
if
they
*NL*
were
heavy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
tired
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
.
``
I
want
diversion
,
and
I
have
done
*NL*
with
men
and
women
.
Play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
it
will
be
conceded
by
my
most
disputatious
reader
,
that
she
*NL*
could
hardly
have
directed
an
unfortunate
boy
to
do
anything
in
the
wide
*NL*
world
more
difficult
to
be
done
under
the
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
have
sick
fancies
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
and
I
have
a
sick
fancy
*NL*
that
I
want
to
see
some
play
.
There
,
there
!
''
with
an
impatient
movement
*NL*
of
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
;
``
play
,
play
,
play
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
,
with
the
fear
of
my
sister
's
working
me
before
my
eyes
,
I
*NL*
had
a
desperate
idea
of
starting
round
the
room
in
the
assumed
character
*NL*
of
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
chaise-cart
.
But
I
felt
myself
so
unequal
to
the
*NL*
performance
that
I
gave
it
up
,
and
stood
looking
at
Miss
Havisham
in
*NL*
what
I
suppose
she
took
for
a
dogged
manner
,
inasmuch
as
she
said
,
when
*NL*
we
had
taken
a
good
look
at
each
other
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sullen
and
obstinate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
,
I
am
very
sorry
for
you
,
and
very
sorry
I
ca
n't
play
just
*NL*
now
.
If
you
complain
of
me
I
shall
get
into
trouble
with
my
sister
,
so
*NL*
I
would
do
it
if
I
could
;
but
it
's
so
new
here
,
and
so
strange
,
and
so
*NL*
fine
,
--
and
melancholy
--
.
''
I
stopped
,
fearing
I
might
say
too
much
,
or
*NL*
had
already
said
it
,
and
we
took
another
look
at
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
she
spoke
again
,
she
turned
her
eyes
from
me
,
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
dress
she
wore
,
and
at
the
dressing-table
,
and
finally
at
herself
in
the
*NL*
looking-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
new
to
him
,
''
she
muttered
,
``
so
old
to
me
;
so
strange
to
him
,
so
*NL*
familiar
to
me
;
so
melancholy
to
both
of
us
!
Call
Estella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
still
looking
at
the
reflection
of
herself
,
I
thought
she
was
*NL*
still
talking
to
herself
,
and
kept
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
Estella
,
''
she
repeated
,
flashing
a
look
at
me
.
``
You
can
do
that
.
*NL*
Call
Estella
.
At
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
stand
in
the
dark
in
a
mysterious
passage
of
an
unknown
house
,
*NL*
bawling
Estella
to
a
scornful
young
lady
neither
visible
nor
responsive
,
*NL*
and
feeling
it
a
dreadful
liberty
so
to
roar
out
her
name
,
was
almost
*NL*
as
bad
as
playing
to
order
.
But
she
answered
at
last
,
and
her
light
came
*NL*
along
the
dark
passage
like
a
star
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
beckoned
her
to
come
close
,
and
took
up
a
jewel
from
the
*NL*
table
,
and
tried
its
effect
upon
her
fair
young
bosom
and
against
her
*NL*
pretty
brown
hair
.
``
Your
own
,
one
day
,
my
dear
,
and
you
will
use
it
*NL*
well
.
Let
me
see
you
play
cards
with
this
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
boy
?
Why
,
he
is
a
common
laboring
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
I
overheard
Miss
Havisham
answer
,
--
only
it
seemed
so
*NL*
unlikely
,
--
``
Well
?
You
can
break
his
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
play
,
boy
?
''
asked
Estella
of
myself
,
with
the
greatest
*NL*
disdain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
but
beggar
my
neighbor
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beggar
him
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
to
Estella
.
So
we
sat
down
to
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
I
began
to
understand
that
everything
in
the
room
had
*NL*
stopped
,
like
the
watch
and
the
clock
,
a
long
time
ago
.
I
noticed
that
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
put
down
the
jewel
exactly
on
the
spot
from
which
she
had
*NL*
taken
it
up
.
As
Estella
dealt
the
cards
,
I
glanced
at
the
dressing-table
*NL*
again
,
and
saw
that
the
shoe
upon
it
,
once
white
,
now
yellow
,
had
never
*NL*
been
worn
.
I
glanced
down
at
the
foot
from
which
the
shoe
was
absent
,
*NL*
and
saw
that
the
silk
stocking
on
it
,
once
white
,
now
yellow
,
had
been
*NL*
trodden
ragged
.
Without
this
arrest
of
everything
,
this
standing
still
*NL*
of
all
the
pale
decayed
objects
,
not
even
the
withered
bridal
dress
on
*NL*
the
collapsed
form
could
have
looked
so
like
grave-clothes
,
or
the
long
*NL*
veil
so
like
a
shroud
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
sat
,
corpse-like
,
as
we
played
at
cards
;
the
frillings
and
*NL*
trimmings
on
her
bridal
dress
,
looking
like
earthy
paper
.
I
knew
nothing
*NL*
then
of
the
discoveries
that
are
occasionally
made
of
bodies
buried
in
*NL*
ancient
times
,
which
fall
to
powder
in
the
moment
of
being
distinctly
*NL*
seen
;
but
,
I
have
often
thought
since
,
that
she
must
have
looked
as
if
*NL*
the
admission
of
the
natural
light
of
day
would
have
struck
her
to
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
calls
the
knaves
Jacks
,
this
boy
!
''
said
Estella
with
disdain
,
before
*NL*
our
first
game
was
out
.
``
And
what
coarse
hands
he
has
!
And
what
thick
*NL*
boots
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
thought
of
being
ashamed
of
my
hands
before
;
but
I
began
*NL*
to
consider
them
a
very
indifferent
pair
.
Her
contempt
for
me
was
so
*NL*
strong
,
that
it
became
infectious
,
and
I
caught
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
won
the
game
,
and
I
dealt
.
I
misdealt
,
as
was
only
natural
,
when
I
*NL*
knew
she
was
lying
in
wait
for
me
to
do
wrong
;
and
she
denounced
me
for
*NL*
a
stupid
,
clumsy
laboring-boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
nothing
of
her
,
''
remarked
Miss
Havisham
to
me
,
as
she
looked
*NL*
on
.
``
She
says
many
hard
things
of
you
,
but
you
say
nothing
of
her
.
What
*NL*
do
you
think
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
say
,
''
I
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
in
my
ear
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
bending
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
is
very
proud
,
''
I
replied
,
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
is
very
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
is
very
insulting
.
''
-LRB-
She
was
looking
at
me
then
with
a
look
*NL*
of
supreme
aversion
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
should
like
to
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
never
see
her
again
,
though
she
is
so
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sure
that
I
should
n't
like
to
see
her
again
,
but
I
should
like
*NL*
to
go
home
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
go
soon
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
aloud
.
``
Play
the
game
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Saving
for
the
one
weird
smile
at
first
,
I
should
have
felt
almost
*NL*
sure
that
Miss
Havisham
's
face
could
not
smile
.
It
had
dropped
into
a
*NL*
watchful
and
brooding
expression
,
--
most
likely
when
all
the
things
about
*NL*
her
had
become
transfixed
,
--
and
it
looked
as
if
nothing
could
ever
lift
*NL*
it
up
again
.
Her
chest
had
dropped
,
so
that
she
stooped
;
and
her
voice
*NL*
had
dropped
,
so
that
she
spoke
low
,
and
with
a
dead
lull
upon
her
;
*NL*
altogether
,
she
had
the
appearance
of
having
dropped
body
and
soul
,
*NL*
within
and
without
,
under
the
weight
of
a
crushing
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
played
the
game
to
an
end
with
Estella
,
and
she
beggared
me
.
She
*NL*
threw
the
cards
down
on
the
table
when
she
had
won
them
all
,
as
if
she
*NL*
despised
them
for
having
been
won
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
shall
I
have
you
here
again
?
''
said
Miss
Havisham
.
``
Let
me
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
beginning
to
remind
her
that
to-day
was
Wednesday
,
when
she
*NL*
checked
me
with
her
former
impatient
movement
of
the
fingers
of
her
*NL*
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
!
I
know
nothing
of
days
of
the
week
;
I
know
nothing
of
*NL*
weeks
of
the
year
.
Come
again
after
six
days
.
You
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Estella
,
take
him
down
.
Let
him
have
something
to
eat
,
and
let
him
roam
*NL*
and
look
about
him
while
he
eats
.
Go
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
followed
the
candle
down
,
as
I
had
followed
the
candle
up
,
and
she
*NL*
stood
it
in
the
place
where
we
had
found
it
.
Until
she
opened
the
*NL*
side
entrance
,
I
had
fancied
,
without
thinking
about
it
,
that
it
must
*NL*
necessarily
be
night-time
.
The
rush
of
the
daylight
quite
confounded
me
,
*NL*
and
made
me
feel
as
if
I
had
been
in
the
candlelight
of
the
strange
room
*NL*
many
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
to
wait
here
,
you
boy
,
''
said
Estella
;
and
disappeared
and
*NL*
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
opportunity
of
being
alone
in
the
courtyard
to
look
at
my
*NL*
coarse
hands
and
my
common
boots
.
My
opinion
of
those
accessories
was
*NL*
not
favorable
.
They
had
never
troubled
me
before
,
but
they
troubled
*NL*
me
now
,
as
vulgar
appendages
.
I
determined
to
ask
Joe
why
he
had
ever
*NL*
taught
me
to
call
those
picture-cards
Jacks
,
which
ought
to
be
called
*NL*
knaves
.
I
wished
Joe
had
been
rather
more
genteelly
brought
up
,
and
then
*NL*
I
should
have
been
so
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
back
,
with
some
bread
and
meat
and
a
little
mug
of
beer
.
She
*NL*
put
the
mug
down
on
the
stones
of
the
yard
,
and
gave
me
the
bread
*NL*
and
meat
without
looking
at
me
,
as
insolently
as
if
I
were
a
dog
in
*NL*
disgrace
.
I
was
so
humiliated
,
hurt
,
spurned
,
offended
,
angry
,
sorry
,
--
I
*NL*
can
not
hit
upon
the
right
name
for
the
smart
--
God
knows
what
its
name
*NL*
was
,
--
that
tears
started
to
my
eyes
.
The
moment
they
sprang
there
,
the
*NL*
girl
looked
at
me
with
a
quick
delight
in
having
been
the
cause
of
them
.
*NL*
This
gave
me
power
to
keep
them
back
and
to
look
at
her
:
so
,
she
gave
a
*NL*
contemptuous
toss
--
but
with
a
sense
,
I
thought
,
of
having
made
too
sure
*NL*
that
I
was
so
wounded
--
and
left
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
was
gone
,
I
looked
about
me
for
a
place
to
hide
my
face
*NL*
in
,
and
got
behind
one
of
the
gates
in
the
brewery-lane
,
and
leaned
my
*NL*
sleeve
against
the
wall
there
,
and
leaned
my
forehead
on
it
and
cried
.
*NL*
As
I
cried
,
I
kicked
the
wall
,
and
took
a
hard
twist
at
my
hair
;
so
*NL*
bitter
were
my
feelings
,
and
so
sharp
was
the
smart
without
a
name
,
that
*NL*
needed
counteraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
's
bringing
up
had
made
me
sensitive
.
In
the
little
world
in
*NL*
which
children
have
their
existence
whosoever
brings
them
up
,
there
is
*NL*
nothing
so
finely
perceived
and
so
finely
felt
as
injustice
.
It
may
be
*NL*
only
small
injustice
that
the
child
can
be
exposed
to
;
but
the
child
*NL*
is
small
,
and
its
world
is
small
,
and
its
rocking-horse
stands
as
many
*NL*
hands
high
,
according
to
scale
,
as
a
big-boned
Irish
hunter
.
Within
*NL*
myself
,
I
had
sustained
,
from
my
babyhood
,
a
perpetual
conflict
with
*NL*
injustice
.
I
had
known
,
from
the
time
when
I
could
speak
,
that
my
*NL*
sister
,
in
her
capricious
and
violent
coercion
,
was
unjust
to
me
.
I
had
*NL*
cherished
a
profound
conviction
that
her
bringing
me
up
by
hand
gave
her
*NL*
no
right
to
bring
me
up
by
jerks
.
Through
all
my
punishments
,
disgraces
,
*NL*
fasts
,
and
vigils
,
and
other
penitential
performances
,
I
had
nursed
*NL*
this
assurance
;
and
to
my
communing
so
much
with
it
,
in
a
solitary
and
*NL*
unprotected
way
,
I
in
great
part
refer
the
fact
that
I
was
morally
timid
*NL*
and
very
sensitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
rid
of
my
injured
feelings
for
the
time
by
kicking
them
into
the
*NL*
brewery
wall
,
and
twisting
them
out
of
my
hair
,
and
then
I
smoothed
my
*NL*
face
with
my
sleeve
,
and
came
from
behind
the
gate
.
The
bread
and
meat
*NL*
were
acceptable
,
and
the
beer
was
warming
and
tingling
,
and
I
was
soon
*NL*
in
spirits
to
look
about
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
,
it
was
a
deserted
place
,
down
to
the
pigeon-house
in
the
*NL*
brewery-yard
,
which
had
been
blown
crooked
on
its
pole
by
some
high
*NL*
wind
,
and
would
have
made
the
pigeons
think
themselves
at
sea
,
if
there
*NL*
had
been
any
pigeons
there
to
be
rocked
by
it
.
But
there
were
no
pigeons
*NL*
in
the
dove-cot
,
no
horses
in
the
stable
,
no
pigs
in
the
sty
,
no
malt
in
*NL*
the
storehouse
,
no
smells
of
grains
and
beer
in
the
copper
or
the
vat
.
*NL*
All
the
uses
and
scents
of
the
brewery
might
have
evaporated
with
its
*NL*
last
reek
of
smoke
.
In
a
by-yard
,
there
was
a
wilderness
of
empty
casks
,
*NL*
which
had
a
certain
sour
remembrance
of
better
days
lingering
about
*NL*
them
;
but
it
was
too
sour
to
be
accepted
as
a
sample
of
the
beer
that
*NL*
was
gone
,
--
and
in
this
respect
I
remember
those
recluses
as
being
like
*NL*
most
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
the
furthest
end
of
the
brewery
,
was
a
rank
garden
with
an
old
*NL*
wall
;
not
so
high
but
that
I
could
struggle
up
and
hold
on
long
enough
*NL*
to
look
over
it
,
and
see
that
the
rank
garden
was
the
garden
of
the
*NL*
house
,
and
that
it
was
overgrown
with
tangled
weeds
,
but
that
there
was
*NL*
a
track
upon
the
green
and
yellow
paths
,
as
if
some
one
sometimes
walked
*NL*
there
,
and
that
Estella
was
walking
away
from
me
even
then
.
But
she
*NL*
seemed
to
be
everywhere
.
For
when
I
yielded
to
the
temptation
presented
*NL*
by
the
casks
,
and
began
to
walk
on
them
,
I
saw
her
walking
on
them
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
yard
of
casks
.
She
had
her
back
towards
me
,
and
held
her
*NL*
pretty
brown
hair
spread
out
in
her
two
hands
,
and
never
looked
round
,
*NL*
and
passed
out
of
my
view
directly
.
So
,
in
the
brewery
itself
,
--
by
which
*NL*
I
mean
the
large
paved
lofty
place
in
which
they
used
to
make
the
beer
,
*NL*
and
where
the
brewing
utensils
still
were
.
When
I
first
went
into
it
,
*NL*
and
,
rather
oppressed
by
its
gloom
,
stood
near
the
door
looking
about
*NL*
me
,
I
saw
her
pass
among
the
extinguished
fires
,
and
ascend
some
light
*NL*
iron
stairs
,
and
go
out
by
a
gallery
high
overhead
,
as
if
she
were
going
*NL*
out
into
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
this
place
,
and
at
this
moment
,
that
a
strange
thing
happened
*NL*
to
my
fancy
.
I
thought
it
a
strange
thing
then
,
and
I
thought
it
a
*NL*
stranger
thing
long
afterwards
.
I
turned
my
eyes
--
a
little
dimmed
by
*NL*
looking
up
at
the
frosty
light
--
towards
a
great
wooden
beam
in
a
low
*NL*
nook
of
the
building
near
me
on
my
right
hand
,
and
I
saw
a
figure
*NL*
hanging
there
by
the
neck
.
A
figure
all
in
yellow
white
,
with
but
*NL*
one
shoe
to
the
feet
;
and
it
hung
so
,
that
I
could
see
that
the
faded
*NL*
trimmings
of
the
dress
were
like
earthy
paper
,
and
that
the
face
was
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
's
,
with
a
movement
going
over
the
whole
countenance
as
if
*NL*
she
were
trying
to
call
to
me
.
In
the
terror
of
seeing
the
figure
,
*NL*
and
in
the
terror
of
being
certain
that
it
had
not
been
there
a
moment
*NL*
before
,
I
at
first
ran
from
it
,
and
then
ran
towards
it
.
And
my
terror
*NL*
was
greatest
of
all
when
I
found
no
figure
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
less
than
the
frosty
light
of
the
cheerful
sky
,
the
sight
of
*NL*
people
passing
beyond
the
bars
of
the
court-yard
gate
,
and
the
reviving
*NL*
influence
of
the
rest
of
the
bread
and
meat
and
beer
,
would
have
brought
*NL*
me
round
.
Even
with
those
aids
,
I
might
not
have
come
to
myself
as
soon
*NL*
as
I
did
,
but
that
I
saw
Estella
approaching
with
the
keys
,
to
let
*NL*
me
out
.
She
would
have
some
fair
reason
for
looking
down
upon
me
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
if
she
saw
me
frightened
;
and
she
would
have
no
fair
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
me
a
triumphant
glance
in
passing
me
,
as
if
she
rejoiced
that
*NL*
my
hands
were
so
coarse
and
my
boots
were
so
thick
,
and
she
opened
the
*NL*
gate
,
and
stood
holding
it
.
I
was
passing
out
without
looking
at
her
,
*NL*
when
she
touched
me
with
a
taunting
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
cry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
,
''
said
she
.
``
You
have
been
crying
till
you
are
half
blind
,
and
*NL*
you
are
near
crying
again
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
contemptuously
,
pushed
me
out
,
and
locked
the
gate
upon
me
.
*NL*
I
went
straight
to
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
,
and
was
immensely
relieved
to
find
*NL*
him
not
at
home
.
So
,
leaving
word
with
the
shopman
on
what
day
I
was
*NL*
wanted
at
Miss
Havisham
's
again
,
I
set
off
on
the
four-mile
walk
to
*NL*
our
forge
;
pondering
,
as
I
went
along
,
on
all
I
had
seen
,
and
deeply
*NL*
revolving
that
I
was
a
common
laboring-boy
;
that
my
hands
were
coarse
;
*NL*
that
my
boots
were
thick
;
that
I
had
fallen
into
a
despicable
habit
*NL*
of
calling
knaves
Jacks
;
that
I
was
much
more
ignorant
than
I
had
*NL*
considered
myself
last
night
,
and
generally
that
I
was
in
a
low-lived
*NL*
bad
way
.

Chapter
IX
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
reached
home
,
my
sister
was
very
curious
to
know
all
about
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
's
,
and
asked
a
number
of
questions
.
And
I
soon
found
myself
*NL*
getting
heavily
bumped
from
behind
in
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
the
small
*NL*
of
the
back
,
and
having
my
face
ignominiously
shoved
against
the
kitchen
*NL*
wall
,
because
I
did
not
answer
those
questions
at
sufficient
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
a
dread
of
not
being
understood
be
hidden
in
the
breasts
of
other
*NL*
young
people
to
anything
like
the
extent
to
which
it
used
to
be
hidden
*NL*
in
mine
,
--
which
I
consider
probable
,
as
I
have
no
particular
reason
*NL*
to
suspect
myself
of
having
been
a
monstrosity
,
--
it
is
the
key
to
many
*NL*
reservations
.
I
felt
convinced
that
if
I
described
Miss
Havisham
's
as
my
*NL*
eyes
had
seen
it
,
I
should
not
be
understood
.
Not
only
that
,
but
I
felt
*NL*
convinced
that
Miss
Havisham
too
would
not
be
understood
;
and
although
*NL*
she
was
perfectly
incomprehensible
to
me
,
I
entertained
an
impression
*NL*
that
there
would
be
something
coarse
and
treacherous
in
my
dragging
*NL*
her
as
she
really
was
-LRB-
to
say
nothing
of
Miss
Estella
-RRB-
before
the
*NL*
contemplation
of
Mrs.
Joe
.
Consequently
,
I
said
as
little
as
I
could
,
*NL*
and
had
my
face
shoved
against
the
kitchen
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
worst
of
it
was
that
that
bullying
old
Pumblechook
,
preyed
upon
by
*NL*
a
devouring
curiosity
to
be
informed
of
all
I
had
seen
and
heard
,
came
*NL*
gaping
over
in
his
chaise-cart
at
tea-time
,
to
have
the
details
divulged
*NL*
to
him
.
And
the
mere
sight
of
the
torment
,
with
his
fishy
eyes
and
mouth
*NL*
open
,
his
sandy
hair
inquisitively
on
end
,
and
his
waistcoat
heaving
*NL*
with
windy
arithmetic
,
made
me
vicious
in
my
reticence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
boy
,
''
Uncle
Pumblechook
began
,
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
in
the
*NL*
chair
of
honor
by
the
fire
.
``
How
did
you
get
on
up
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
``
Pretty
well
,
sir
,
''
and
my
sister
shook
her
fist
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
?
''
Mr.
Pumblechook
repeated
.
``
Pretty
well
is
no
answer
.
Tell
*NL*
us
what
you
mean
by
pretty
well
,
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whitewash
on
the
forehead
hardens
the
brain
into
a
state
of
obstinacy
*NL*
perhaps
.
Anyhow
,
with
whitewash
from
the
wall
on
my
forehead
,
my
*NL*
obstinacy
was
adamantine
.
I
reflected
for
some
time
,
and
then
answered
*NL*
as
if
I
had
discovered
a
new
idea
,
``
I
mean
pretty
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
was
going
to
fly
at
me
,
--
I
*NL*
had
no
shadow
of
defence
,
for
Joe
was
busy
in
the
forge
,
--
when
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
interposed
with
``
No
!
Do
n't
lose
your
temper
.
Leave
this
*NL*
lad
to
me
,
ma'am
;
leave
this
lad
to
me
.
''
Mr.
Pumblechook
then
turned
me
*NL*
towards
him
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
cut
my
hair
,
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
-LRB-
to
get
our
thoughts
in
order
-RRB-
:
Forty-three
pence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
calculated
the
consequences
of
replying
``
Four
Hundred
Pound
,
''
and
*NL*
finding
them
against
me
,
went
as
near
the
answer
as
I
could
--
which
was
*NL*
somewhere
about
eightpence
off
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
then
put
me
through
my
*NL*
pence-table
from
``
twelve
pence
make
one
shilling
,
''
up
to
``
forty
pence
*NL*
make
three
and
fourpence
,
''
and
then
triumphantly
demanded
,
as
if
he
had
*NL*
done
for
me
,
``
Now
!
How
much
is
forty-three
pence
?
''
To
which
I
replied
,
*NL*
after
a
long
interval
of
reflection
,
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
And
I
was
so
*NL*
aggravated
that
I
almost
doubt
if
I
did
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
worked
his
head
like
a
screw
to
screw
it
out
of
me
,
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Is
forty-three
pence
seven
and
sixpence
three
fardens
,
for
*NL*
instance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
said
I.
And
although
my
sister
instantly
boxed
my
ears
,
it
was
*NL*
highly
gratifying
to
me
to
see
that
the
answer
spoilt
his
joke
,
and
*NL*
brought
him
to
a
dead
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boy
!
What
like
is
Miss
Havisham
?
''
Mr.
Pumblechook
began
again
when
*NL*
he
had
recovered
;
folding
his
arms
tight
on
his
chest
and
applying
the
*NL*
screw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
tall
and
dark
,
''
I
told
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
,
uncle
?
''
asked
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
winked
assent
;
from
which
I
at
once
inferred
that
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
Miss
Havisham
,
for
she
was
nothing
of
the
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
conceitedly
.
-LRB-
``
This
is
the
way
to
have
him
!
*NL*
We
are
beginning
to
hold
our
own

?
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
uncle

''
returned
Mrs.
Joe
,
``
I
wish
you
had
him
always
;
you
*NL*
know
so
well
how
to
deal
with
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
boy
!
What
was
she
a
doing
of
,
when
you
went
in
today
?
''
asked
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
sitting
,
''
I
answered
,
``
in
a
black
velvet
coach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
and
Mrs.
Joe
stared
at
one
another
--
as
they
well
*NL*
might
--
and
both
repeated
,
``
In
a
black
velvet
coach
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I.
``
And
Miss
Estella

that

her
niece

I
think

handed
her
*NL*
in
cake
and
wine
at
the
coach-window
,
on
a
gold
plate
.
And
we
all
had
*NL*
cake
and
wine
on
gold
plates
.
And
I
got
up
behind
the
coach
to
eat
mine
,
*NL*
because
she
told
me
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
anybody
else
there
?
''
asked
Mr.
Pumblechook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
dogs

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Large
or
small
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immense
,
''
said
I.
``
And
they
fought

veal-cutlets
out
of
a
silver
*NL*
basket

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
and
Mrs.
Joe
stared
at
one
another
again
,
in
utter
*NL*
amazement
.
I
was
perfectly
frantic
,
--
a
reckless
witness
under
the
*NL*
torture
,
--
and
would
have
told
them
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
was
this
coach
,
in
the
name
of
gracious
?
''
asked
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Miss
Havisham
's
room
.
''
They
stared
again
.
``
But
there
were
n't
any
*NL*
horses
to
it
.
''
I
added
this
saving
clause
,
in
the
moment
of
rejecting
*NL*
four
richly
caparisoned
coursers
which
I
had
had
wild
thoughts
of
*NL*
harnessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
this
be
possible
,
uncle
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Joe
.
``
What
can
the
boy
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you

said
Mr.
Pumblechook
.
``
My
opinion

it

a

sedan-chair

She
's
flighty

very
flighty

quite
flighty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever

asked
Mrs.

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
,
''
he
returned
,
forced
to
the
admission
,
``
when
I
never
see
*NL*
her
in
my
life
?
Never
clapped
eyes
upon
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness

And
yet
you
have
spoken
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
n't
you
know
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
testily
,
``
that
when
I
have
*NL*
been
there

took
up

the
door
*NL*
has
stood
ajar

and
she
has
spoke
to

that
way

Do
n't
say
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
that

Mum

Howsever
,
the

went
there
to

What
did
you
play
*NL*
at
,
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
played
with
flags

''
I
said
.
-LRB-
I
beg
to
observe
that
I
think
of
myself
*NL*
with
amazement
,
when
I
recall
the
lies
I
told
on
this
occasion
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flags
!
''
echoed
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I.
``
Estella
waved
a
blue
flag
,
and
I
waved
a
red
one
,
and
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
waved
one
sprinkled
all
over
with
little
gold
stars
,
out
*NL*
at
the
coach-window
.
And
then
we
all
waved
our
swords
and
hurrahed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Swords
!
''
repeated
my
sister
.
``
Where
did
you
get
swords
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
a
cupboard
,
''
said
I.
``
And
I
saw
pistols
in
it
,
--
and
jam
,
--
and
*NL*
pills
.
And
there
was
no
daylight
in
the
room
,
but
it
was
all
lighted
up
*NL*
with
candles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
Mum
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
with
a
grave
nod
.
``
That
's
the
*NL*
state
of
the
case
,
for
that
much
I
've
seen
myself
.
''
And
then
they
*NL*
both
stared
at
me
,
and
I
,
with
an
obtrusive
show
of
artlessness
on
my
*NL*
countenance
,
stared
at
them
,
and
plaited
the
right
leg
of
my
trousers
*NL*
with
my
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
they
had
asked
me
any
more
questions
,
I
should
undoubtedly
have
*NL*
betrayed
myself
,
for
I
was
even
then
on
the
point
of
mentioning
that
*NL*
there
was
a
balloon
in
the
yard
,
and
should
have
hazarded
the
statement
*NL*
but
for
my
invention
being
divided
between
that
phenomenon
and
a
bear
*NL*
in
the
brewery
.
They
were
so
much
occupied
,
however
,
in
discussing
the
*NL*
marvels
I
had
already
presented
for
their
consideration
,
that
I
escaped
.
*NL*
The
subject
still
held
them
when
Joe
came
in
from
his
work
to
have
a
cup
*NL*
of
tea
.
To
whom
my
sister
,
more
for
the
relief
of
her
own
mind
than
for
*NL*
the
gratification
of
his
,
related
my
pretended
experiences
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
when
I
saw
Joe
open
his
blue
eyes
and
roll
them
all
round
the
*NL*
kitchen
in
helpless
amazement
,
I
was
overtaken
by
penitence
;
but
only
as
*NL*
regarded
him
,
--
not
in
the
least
as
regarded
the
other
two
.
Towards
*NL*
Joe
,
and
Joe
only
,
I
considered
myself
a
young
monster
,
while
they
sat
*NL*
debating
what
results
would
come
to
me
from
Miss
Havisham
's
acquaintance
*NL*
and
favor
.
They
had
no
doubt
that
Miss
Havisham
would
``
do
something
''
*NL*
for
me
;
their
doubts
related
to
the
form
that
something
would
take
.
*NL*
My
sister
stood
out
for
``
property
.
''
Mr.
Pumblechook
was
in
favor
of
a
*NL*
handsome
premium
for
binding
me
apprentice
to
some
genteel
trade
,
--
say
,
*NL*
the
corn
and
seed
trade
,
for
instance
.
Joe
fell
into
the
deepest
*NL*
disgrace
with
both
,
for
offering
the
bright
suggestion
that
I
might
only
*NL*
be
presented
with
one
of
the
dogs
who
had
fought
for
the
veal-cutlets
.
*NL*
``
If
a
fool
's
head
ca
n't
express
better
opinions
than
that
,
''
said
my
*NL*
sister
,
``
and
you
have
got
any
work
to
do
,
you
had
better
go
and
do
it
.
''
*NL*
So
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Mr.
Pumblechook
had
driven
off
,
and
when
my
sister
was
washing
up
,
*NL*
I
stole
into
the
forge
to
Joe
,
and
remained
by
him
until
he
had
done
for
*NL*
the
night
.
Then
I
said
,
``
Before
the
fire
goes
out
,
Joe
,
I
should
like
to
*NL*
tell
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
,
Pip
?
''
said
Joe
,
drawing
his
shoeing-stool
near
the
forge
.
*NL*
``
Then
tell
us
.
What
is
it
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joe
,
''
said
I
,
taking
hold
of
his
rolled-up
shirt
sleeve
,
and
twisting
*NL*
it
between
my
finger
and
thumb
,
``
you
remember
all
that
about
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
?
''
said
Joe
.
``
I
believe
you
!
Wonderful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
terrible
thing
,
Joe
;
it
ai
n't
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
telling
of
,
Pip
?
''
cried
Joe
,
falling
back
in
the
greatest
*NL*
amazement
.
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
it
's

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
I
do
;
it
's
lies
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
all
of
it
?
Why
sure
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
,
Pip
,
that
there
was
*NL*
no
black
welwet
co
--
eh
?
''
For
,
I
stood
shaking
my
head
.
``
But
at
least
*NL*
there
was
dogs
,
Pip
?
Come
,
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
,
persuasively
,
``
if
there
*NL*
war
n't
no
weal-cutlets
,
at
least
there
was
dogs

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

said
Joe
.
``
A

Come

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Joe
,
there
was
nothing
at
all
of
the
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
fixed
my
eyes
hopelessly
on
Joe
,
Joe
contemplated
me
in
dismay
.
*NL*
``
Pip
,
old
chap
!
This
wo
n't
do

old
fellow
!
I
say
!
Where
do

*NL*
go
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
terrible
,
Joe
;
ai
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Terrible

''
cried
Joe
.
``
Awful
!
What
possessed
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
possessed
me
,
Joe
,
''
I
replied
,
letting
his
shirt
*NL*
sleeve
go
,
and
sitting
down
in
the
ashes
at
his
feet
,
hanging
my
head
;
*NL*
``
but
I
wish
you
had
n't
taught
me
to
call
Knaves
at
cards
Jacks

and
I
*NL*
wish

boots
were
n't
so
thick
nor
my
hands
so
coarse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
I
told
Joe
that
I
felt
very
miserable
,
and
that
I
had
n't
been
*NL*
able
to
explain
myself
to
Mrs.
Joe
and
Pumblechook
,
who
were
so
rude
to
*NL*
me
,
and
that
there
had
been
a
beautiful
young
lady
at
Miss
Havisham
's
*NL*
who
was
dreadfully
proud
,
and
that
she
had
said
I
was
common
,
and
that
I
*NL*
knew
I
was
common
,
and
that
I
wished
I
was
not
common
,
and
that
the
lies
*NL*
had
come
of
it
somehow
,
though
I
did
n't
know
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
case
of
metaphysics
,
at
least
as
difficult
for
Joe
to
deal
*NL*
with
as
for
me
.
But
Joe
took
the
case
altogether
out
of
the
region
of
*NL*
metaphysics
,
and
by
that
means
vanquished
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
thing
you
may
be
sure
of
,
Pip

''
said
Joe
,
after
some
*NL*
rumination
,
``
namely

that
lies

they

out

full
of

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some

in
this

encouraged

me

``

reflectively

reminds

Whether

be

is
a
thing

ca

be
looked
into
now

without
putting
*NL*
your

on
the

that
's
a
thing
not

being
done

Lookee

at

When
I
got
up
to
my
little
room
and
said
my
prayers
,
I
did
not
forget
*NL*
Joe
's
recommendation
,
and
yet
my
young
mind
was
in
that
disturbed
and
*NL*
unthankful
state
,
that
I
thought
long
after
I
laid
me
down
,
how
common
*NL*
Estella
would
consider
Joe
,
a
mere
blacksmith
;
how
thick
his
boots
,
and
*NL*
how
coarse
his
hands
.
I
thought
how
Joe
and
my
sister
were
then
sitting
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
,
and
how
I
had
come
up
to
bed
from
the
kitchen
,
and
how
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
never
sat
in
a
kitchen
,
but
were
far
above
the
*NL*
level
of
such
common
doings
.
I
fell
asleep
recalling
what
I
``
used
to
*NL*
do
''
when
I
was
at
Miss
Havisham
's
;
as
though
I
had
been
there
weeks
or
*NL*
months
,
instead
of
hours
;
and
as
though
it
were
quite
an
old
subject
of
*NL*
remembrance
,
instead
of
one
that
had
arisen
only
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
memorable
day
to
me
,
for
it
made
great
changes
in
me
.
But
it
*NL*
is
the
same
with
any
life
.
Imagine
one
selected
day
struck
out
of
it
,
*NL*
and
think
how
different
its
course
would
have
been
.
Pause
you
who
read
*NL*
this
,
and
think
for
a
moment
of
the
long
chain
of
iron
or
gold
,
*NL*
of
thorns
or
flowers
,
that
would
never
have
bound
you
,
but
for
the
*NL*
formation
of
the
first
link
on
one
memorable
day

Chapter
X
*NL*
*NL*
The
felicitous
idea
occurred
to
me
a
morning
or
two
later
when
I
woke
,
*NL*
that
the
best
step
I
could
take
towards
making
myself
uncommon
was
to
*NL*
get
out
of
Biddy
everything
she
knew
.
In
pursuance
of
this
luminous
*NL*
conception
I
mentioned
to
Biddy
when
I
went
to
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
's
*NL*
at
night
,
that
I
had
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
get
on
in
life
,
*NL*
and
that
I
should
feel
very
much
obliged
to
her
if
she
would
impart
*NL*
all
her
learning
to
me
.
Biddy
,
who
was
the
most
obliging
of
girls
,
*NL*
immediately
said
she
would
,
and
indeed
began
to
carry
out
her
promise
*NL*
within
five
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Educational
scheme
or
Course
established
by
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
*NL*
may
be
resolved
into
the
following
synopsis
.
The
pupils
ate
apples
*NL*
and
put
straws
down
one
another
's
backs
,
until
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
*NL*
collected
her
energies
,
and
made
an
indiscriminate
totter
at
them
with
*NL*
a
birch-rod
.
After
receiving
the
charge
with
every
mark
of
derision
,
the
*NL*
pupils
formed
in
line
and
buzzingly
passed
a
ragged
book
from
hand
to
*NL*
hand
.
The
book
had
an
alphabet
in
it
,
some
figures
and
tables
,
and
*NL*
a
little
spelling
,
--
that
is
to
say
,
it
had
had
once
.
As
soon
as
this
*NL*
volume
began
to
circulate
,
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
fell
into
a
state
of
*NL*
coma
,
arising
either
from
sleep
or
a
rheumatic
paroxysm
.
The
pupils
then
*NL*
entered
among
themselves
upon
a
competitive
examination
on
the
subject
*NL*
of
Boots
,
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
who
could
tread
the
hardest
upon
*NL*
whose
toes
.
This
mental
exercise
lasted
until
Biddy
made
a
rush
at
*NL*
them
and
distributed
three
defaced
Bibles
-LRB-
shaped
as
if
they
had
been
*NL*
unskilfully
cut
off
the
chump
end
of
something
-RRB-
,
more
illegibly
printed
*NL*
at
the
best
than
any
curiosities
of
literature
I
have
since
met
with
,
*NL*
speckled
all
over
with
ironmould
,
and
having
various
specimens
of
the
*NL*
insect
world
smashed
between
their
leaves
.
This
part
of
the
Course
was
*NL*
usually
lightened
by
several
single
combats
between
Biddy
and
refractory
*NL*
students
.
When
the
fights
were
over
,
Biddy
gave
out
the
number
of
a
*NL*
page
,
and
then
we
all
read
aloud
what
we
could
,
--
or
what
we
could
n't
--
in
*NL*
a
frightful
chorus
;
Biddy
leading
with
a
high
,
shrill
,
monotonous
voice
,
*NL*
and
none
of
us
having
the
least
notion
of
,
or
reverence
for
,
what
we
*NL*
were
reading
about
.
When
this
horrible
din
had
lasted
a
certain
time
,
*NL*
it
mechanically
awoke
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
,
who
staggered
at
a
boy
*NL*
fortuitously
,
and
pulled
his
ears
.
This
was
understood
to
terminate
*NL*
the
Course
for
the
evening
,
and
we
emerged
into
the
air
with
shrieks
of
*NL*
intellectual
victory
.
It
is
fair
to
remark
that
there
was
no
prohibition
*NL*
against
any
pupil
's
entertaining
himself
with
a
slate
or
even
with
the
*NL*
ink
-LRB-
when
there
was
any
-RRB-
,
but
that
it
was
not
easy
to
pursue
that
branch
*NL*
of
study
in
the
winter
season
,
on
account
of
the
little
general
shop
*NL*
in
which
the
classes
were
holden
--
and
which
was
also
Mr.
Wopsle
's
*NL*
great-aunt
's
sitting-room
and
bedchamber
--
being
but
faintly
illuminated
*NL*
through
the
agency
of
one
low-spirited
dip-candle
and
no
snuffers
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
to
me
that
it
would
take
time
to
become
uncommon
,
under
*NL*
these
circumstances
:
nevertheless
,
I
resolved
to
try
it
,
and
that
*NL*
very
evening
Biddy
entered
on
our
special
agreement
,
by
imparting
some
*NL*
information
from
her
little
catalogue
of
Prices
,
under
the
head
of
moist
*NL*
sugar
,
and
lending
me
,
to
copy
at
home
,
a
large
old
English
D
which
she
*NL*
had
imitated
from
the
heading
of
some
newspaper
,
and
which
I
supposed
,
*NL*
until
she
told
me
what
it
was
,
to
be
a
design
for
a
buckle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
there
was
a
public-house
in
the
village
,
and
of
course
Joe
*NL*
liked
sometimes
to
smoke
his
pipe
there
.
I
had
received
strict
orders
*NL*
from
my
sister
to
call
for
him
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
that
*NL*
evening
,
on
my
way
from
school
,
and
bring
him
home
at
my
peril
.
To
the
*NL*
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
therefore
,
I
directed
my
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
bar
at
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
with
some
alarmingly
long
chalk
*NL*
scores
in
it
on
the
wall
at
the
side
of
the
door
,
which
seemed
to
me
to
*NL*
be
never
paid
off
.
They
had
been
there
ever
since
I
could
remember
,
and
*NL*
had
grown
more
than
I
had
.
But
there
was
a
quantity
of
chalk
about
our
*NL*
country
,
and
perhaps
the
people
neglected
no
opportunity
of
turning
it
*NL*
to
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
being
Saturday
night
,
I
found
the
landlord
looking
rather
grimly
*NL*
at
these
records
;
but
as
my
business
was
with
Joe
and
not
with
him
,
I
*NL*
merely
wished
him
good
evening
,
and
passed
into
the
common
room
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
passage
,
where
there
was
a
bright
large
kitchen
fire
,
*NL*
and
where
Joe
was
smoking
his
pipe
in
company
with
Mr.
Wopsle
and
a
*NL*
stranger
.
Joe
greeted
me
as
usual
with
``
Halloa
,
Pip
,
old
chap
!
''
and
the
*NL*
moment
he
said
that
,
the
stranger
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
secret-looking
man
whom
I
had
never
seen
before
.
His
head
was
*NL*
all
on
one
side
,
and
one
of
his
eyes
was
half
shut
up
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
taking
aim
at
something
with
an
invisible
gun
.
He
had
a
pipe
in
his
*NL*
mouth
,
and
he
took
it
out
,
and
,
after
slowly
blowing
all
his
smoke
away
*NL*
and
looking
hard
at
me
all
the
time
,
nodded
.
So
,
I
nodded
,
and
then
he
*NL*
nodded
again
,
and
made
room
on
the
settle
beside
him
that
I
might
sit
*NL*
down
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
I
was
used
to
sit
beside
Joe
whenever
I
entered
that
place
of
*NL*
resort
,
I
said
``
No
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
''
and
fell
into
the
space
Joe
made
*NL*
for
me
on
the
opposite
settle
.
The
strange
man
,
after
glancing
at
Joe
,
*NL*
and
seeing
that
his
attention
was
otherwise
engaged
,
nodded
to
me
again
*NL*
when
I
had
taken
my
seat
,
and
then
rubbed
his
leg
--
in
a
very
odd
way
,
as
*NL*
it
struck
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
was
saying
,
''
said
the
strange
man
,
turning
to
Joe
,
``
that
you
was
a
*NL*
blacksmith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
said
it
,
you
know
,
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
'll
you
drink
,
Mr.
--
?
You
did
n't
mention
your
name
,
by
the
bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
mentioned
it
now
,
and
the
strange
man
called
him
by
it
.
``
What
'll
you
*NL*
drink
,
Mr.
Gargery
?
At
my
expense
?
To
top
up
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
ai
n't
much
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
drinking
at
anybody
's
expense
but
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Habit
?
No

''
returned
the
stranger
,
``
but
once
and
away
,
and
on
a
*NL*
Saturday
night
too
.
Come
!
Put
a
name
to
it

Mr.
Gargery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
wish
to
be
stiff
company
,
''
said
Joe
.
``
Rum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rum
,
''
repeated
the
stranger
.
``
And
will
the
other
gentleman
originate
a
*NL*
sentiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rum
,
''
said
Mr.
Wopsle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
Rums
!
''
cried
the
stranger
,
calling
to
the
landlord
.
``
Glasses
*NL*
round
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
other
gentleman
,
''
observed
Joe
,
by
way
of
introducing
Mr.
Wopsle
,
*NL*
``
is
a
gentleman
that
you
would
like
to
hear
give
it
out
.
Our
clerk
at
*NL*
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
''
said
the
stranger
,
quickly
,
and
cocking
his
eye
at
me
.
``
The
*NL*
lonely
church
,
right
out
on
the
marshes
,
with
graves
round
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
,
with
a
comfortable
kind
of
grunt
over
his
pipe
,
put
*NL*
his
legs
up
on
the
settle
that
he
had
to
himself
.
He
wore
a
flapping
*NL*
broad-brimmed
traveller
's
hat
,
and
under
it
a
handkerchief
tied
over
his
*NL*
head
in
the
manner
of
a
cap
:
so
that
he
showed
no
hair
.
As
he
looked
*NL*
at
the
fire
,
I
thought
I
saw
a
cunning
expression
,
followed
by
a
*NL*
half-laugh
,
come
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
acquainted
with
this
country
,
gentlemen
,
but
it
seems
a
*NL*
solitary
country
towards

river

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
marshes
is
solitary

said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

Do
you

out
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Joe
;
``
none

and
then

And

Eh

Mr.
Wopsle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
,
with
a
majestic
remembrance
of
old
discomfiture
,
assented
;
*NL*
but
not
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seems
you
have
been
out
after
such
?

asked
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once

returned
Joe
.
``
Not

The

looked
at
me
again
,
--
still
cocking
his
eye
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
expressly
taking
aim
at
me
with
his
invisible
gun
,
--
and
said
,
``
He
's
a
*NL*
likely
young
parcel
of
bones
that
.
What
is
it
you
call
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christened
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
christened
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surname
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
it
's
a
kind
of
family
name
what
he
gave
himself
when
a
*NL*
infant
,
and
is
called
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Son
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Joe
,
meditatively
,
not
,
of
course
,
that
it
could
be
in
*NL*
anywise
necessary
to
consider
about
it
,
but
because
it
was
the
way
at
*NL*
the
Jolly
Bargemen
to
seem
to
consider
deeply
about
everything
that
was
*NL*
discussed
over
pipes
,
--
``
well
--
no
.
No
,
he
ai
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevvy
?
''
said
the
strange
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Joe
,
with
the
same
appearance
of
profound
cogitation
,
``
he
*NL*
is
not
--
no
,
not
to
deceive
you
,
he
is
not
--
my
nevvy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
Blue
Blazes
is
he
?
''
asked
the
stranger
.
Which
appeared
to
me
*NL*
to
be
an
inquiry
of
unnecessary
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
struck
in
upon
that
;
as
one
who
knew
all
about
relationships
,
*NL*
having
professional
occasion
to
bear
in
mind
what
female
relations
a
man
*NL*
might
not
marry
;
and
expounded
the
ties
between
me
and
Joe
.
Having
*NL*
his
hand
in
,
Mr.
Wopsle
finished
off
with
a
most
terrifically
snarling
*NL*
passage
from
Richard
the
Third
,
and
seemed
to
think
he
had
done
quite
*NL*
enough
to
account
for
it
when
he
added
,
''
--
as
the
poet
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
I
may
remark
that
when
Mr.
Wopsle
referred
to
me
,
he
considered
*NL*
it
a
necessary
part
of
such
reference
to
rumple
my
hair
and
poke
it
into
*NL*
my
eyes
.
I
can
not
conceive
why
everybody
of
his
standing
who
visited
*NL*
at
our
house
should
always
have
put
me
through
the
same
inflammatory
*NL*
process
under
similar
circumstances
.
Yet
I
do
not
call
to
mind
that
I
*NL*
was
ever
in
my
earlier
youth
the
subject
of
remark
in
our
social
family
*NL*
circle
,
but
some
large-handed
person
took
some
such
ophthalmic
steps
to
*NL*
patronize
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
,
the
strange
man
looked
at
nobody
but
me
,
and
looked
at
*NL*
me
as
if
he
were
determined
to
have
a
shot
at
me
at
last
,
and
bring
me
*NL*
down
.
But
he
said
nothing
after
offering
his
Blue
Blazes
observation
,
*NL*
until
the
glasses
of
rum
and
water
were
brought
;
and
then
he
made
his
*NL*
shot
,
and
a
most
extraordinary
shot
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
verbal
remark
,
but
a
proceeding
in
dumb-show
,
and
was
*NL*
pointedly
addressed
to
me
.
He
stirred
his
rum
and
water
pointedly
at
me
,
*NL*
and
he
tasted
his
rum
and
water
pointedly
at
me
.
And
he
stirred
it
and
*NL*
he
tasted
it
;
not
with
a
spoon
that
was
brought
to
him
,
but
with
a
file
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
this
so
that
nobody
but
I
saw
the
file
;
and
when
he
had
done
it
*NL*
he
wiped
the
file
and
put
it
in
a
breast-pocket
.
I
knew
it
to
be
*NL*
Joe
's
file
,
and
I
knew
that
he
knew
my
convict
,
the
moment
I
saw
the
*NL*
instrument
.
I
sat
gazing
at
him
,
spell-bound
.
But
he
now
reclined
on
his
*NL*
settle
,
taking
very
little
notice
of
me
,
and
talking
principally
about
*NL*
turnips
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
delicious
sense
of
cleaning-up
and
making
a
quiet
pause
*NL*
before
going
on
in
life
afresh
,
in
our
village
on
Saturday
nights
,
which
*NL*
stimulated
Joe
to
dare
to
stay
out
half
an
hour
longer
on
Saturdays
*NL*
than
at
other
times
.
The
half-hour
and
the
rum
and
water
running
out
*NL*
together
,
Joe
got
up
to
go
,
and
took
me
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
half
a
moment
,
Mr.
Gargery
,
''
said
the
strange
man
.
``
I
think
I
've
*NL*
got
a
bright
new
shilling
somewhere
in
my
pocket
,
and
if
I
have
,
the
boy
*NL*
shall
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
it
out
from
a
handful
of
small
change
,
folded
it
in
some
*NL*
crumpled
paper
,
and
gave
it
to
me
.
``
Yours
!
''
said
he
.
``
Mind
!
Your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
,
staring
at
him
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
good
manners
,
*NL*
and
holding
tight
to
Joe
.
He
gave
Joe
good-night
,
and
he
gave
Mr.
Wopsle
*NL*
good-night
-LRB-
who
went
out
with
us
-RRB-
,
and
he
gave
me
only
a
look
with
his
*NL*
aiming
eye
,
--
no
,
not
a
look
,
for
he
shut
it
up
,
but
wonders
may
be
done
*NL*
with
an
eye
by
hiding
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
home
,
if
I
had
been
in
a
humor
for
talking
,
the
talk
must
*NL*
have
been
all
on
my
side
,
for
Mr.
Wopsle
parted
from
us
at
the
door
of
*NL*
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
and
Joe
went
all
the
way
home
with
his
mouth
wide
*NL*
open
,
to
rinse
the
rum
out
with
as
much
air
as
possible
.
But
I
was
in
*NL*
a
manner
stupefied
by
this
turning
up
of
my
old
misdeed
and
old
*NL*
acquaintance
,
and
could
think
of
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
was
not
in
a
very
bad
temper
when
we
presented
ourselves
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
and
Joe
was
encouraged
by
that
unusual
circumstance
to
tell
*NL*
her
about
the
bright
shilling
.
``
A
bad
un
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
''
said
Mrs.
Joe
*NL*
triumphantly
,
``
or
he
would
n't
have
given
it
to
the
boy
!
Let
's
look
at
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
it
out
of
the
paper
,
and
it
proved
to
be
a
good
one
.
``
But
what
's
*NL*
this
?
''
said
Mrs.
Joe
,
throwing
down
the
shilling
and
catching
up
the
*NL*
paper
.
``
Two
One-Pound
notes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
less
than
two
fat
sweltering
one-pound
notes
that
seemed
to
have
*NL*
been
on
terms
of
the
warmest
intimacy
with
all
the
cattle-markets
in
*NL*
the
county
.
Joe
caught
up
his
hat
again
,
and
ran
with
them
to
the
Jolly
*NL*
Bargemen
to
restore
them
to
their
owner
.
While
he
was
gone
,
I
sat
down
*NL*
on
my
usual
stool
and
looked
vacantly
at
my
sister
,
feeling
pretty
sure
*NL*
that
the
man
would
not
be
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
Joe
came
back
,
saying
that
the
man
was
gone
,
but
that
he
,
*NL*
Joe
,
had
left
word
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
concerning
the
notes
.
*NL*
Then
my
sister
sealed
them
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
put
them
under
*NL*
some
dried
rose-leaves
in
an
ornamental
teapot
on
the
top
of
a
press
in
*NL*
the
state
parlor
.
There
they
remained
,
a
nightmare
to
me
,
many
and
many
*NL*
a
night
and
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
sadly
broken
sleep
when
I
got
to
bed
,
through
thinking
of
the
*NL*
strange
man
taking
aim
at
me
with
his
invisible
gun
,
and
of
the
guiltily
*NL*
coarse
and
common
thing
it
was
,
to
be
on
secret
terms
of
conspiracy
with
*NL*
convicts
,
--
a
feature
in
my
low
career
that
I
had
previously
forgotten
.
*NL*
I
was
haunted
by
the
file
too
.
A
dread
possessed
me
that
when
I
least
*NL*
expected
it
,
the
file
would
reappear
.
I
coaxed
myself
to
sleep
by
*NL*
thinking
of
Miss
Havisham
's
,
next
Wednesday
;
and
in
my
sleep
I
saw
*NL*
the
file
coming
at
me
out
of
a
door
,
without
seeing
who
held
it
,
and
I
*NL*
screamed
myself
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XI
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
appointed
time
I
returned
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
my
hesitating
*NL*
ring
at
the
gate
brought
out
Estella
.
She
locked
it
after
admitting
*NL*
me
,
as
she
had
done
before
,
and
again
preceded
me
into
the
dark
passage
*NL*
where
her
candle
stood
.
She
took
no
notice
of
me
until
she
had
the
*NL*
candle
in
her
hand
,
when
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
,
superciliously
*NL*
saying
,
``
You
are
to
come
this
way
to-day
,
''
and
took
me
to
quite
another
*NL*
part
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
passage
was
a
long
one
,
and
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
square
*NL*
basement
of
the
Manor
House
.
We
traversed
but
one
side
of
the
square
,
*NL*
however
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
she
stopped
,
and
put
her
candle
down
and
*NL*
opened
a
door
.
Here
,
the
daylight
reappeared
,
and
I
found
myself
in
*NL*
a
small
paved
courtyard
,
the
opposite
side
of
which
was
formed
by
a
*NL*
detached
dwelling-house
,
that
looked
as
if
it
had
once
belonged
to
the
*NL*
manager
or
head
clerk
of
the
extinct
brewery
.
There
was
a
clock
in
the
*NL*
outer
wall
of
this
house
.
Like
the
clock
in
Miss
Havisham
's
room
,
and
*NL*
like
Miss
Havisham
's
watch
,
it
had
stopped
at
twenty
minutes
to
nine
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
in
at
the
door
,
which
stood
open
,
and
into
a
gloomy
room
with
a
*NL*
low
ceiling
,
on
the
ground-floor
at
the
back
.
There
was
some
company
in
*NL*
the
room
,
and
Estella
said
to
me
as
she
joined
it
,
``
You
are
to
go
and
*NL*
stand
there
boy
,
till
you
are
wanted
.
''
``
There
''
,
being
the
window
,
I
*NL*
crossed
to
it
,
and
stood
``
there
,
''
in
a
very
uncomfortable
state
of
mind
,
*NL*
looking
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
opened
to
the
ground
,
and
looked
into
a
most
miserable
corner
of
the
*NL*
neglected
garden
,
upon
a
rank
ruin
of
cabbage-stalks
,
and
one
box-tree
*NL*
that
had
been
clipped
round
long
ago
,
like
a
pudding
,
and
had
a
new
*NL*
growth
at
the
top
of
it
,
out
of
shape
and
of
a
different
color
,
as
if
*NL*
that
part
of
the
pudding
had
stuck
to
the
saucepan
and
got
burnt
.
This
*NL*
was
my
homely
thought
,
as
I
contemplated
the
box-tree
.
There
had
been
*NL*
some
light
snow
,
overnight
,
and
it
lay
nowhere
else
to
my
knowledge
;
*NL*
but
,
it
had
not
quite
melted
from
the
cold
shadow
of
this
bit
of
garden
,
*NL*
and
the
wind
caught
it
up
in
little
eddies
and
threw
it
at
the
window
,
*NL*
as
if
it
pelted
me
for
coming
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
divined
that
my
coming
had
stopped
conversation
in
the
room
,
and
that
*NL*
its
other
occupants
were
looking
at
me
.
I
could
see
nothing
of
the
room
*NL*
except
the
shining
of
the
fire
in
the
window-glass
,
but
I
stiffened
in
*NL*
all
my
joints
with
the
consciousness
that
I
was
under
close
inspection
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
three
ladies
in
the
room
and
one
gentleman
.
Before
I
had
been
*NL*
standing
at
the
window
five
minutes
,
they
somehow
conveyed
to
me
that
*NL*
they
were
all
toadies
and
humbugs
,
but
that
each
of
them
pretended
not
*NL*
to
know
that
the
others
were
toadies
and
humbugs
:
because
the
admission
*NL*
that
he
or
she
did
know
it
,
would
have
made
him
or
her
out
to
be
a
toady
*NL*
and
humbug
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
had
a
listless
and
dreary
air
of
waiting
somebody
's
pleasure
,
*NL*
and
the
most
talkative
of
the
ladies
had
to
speak
quite
rigidly
to
*NL*
repress
a
yawn
.
This
lady
,
whose
name
was
Camilla
,
very
much
reminded
*NL*
me
of
my
sister
,
with
the
difference
that
she
was
older
,
and
-LRB-
as
I
found
*NL*
when
I
caught
sight
of
her
-RRB-
of
a
blunter
cast
of
features
.
Indeed
,
when
*NL*
I
knew
her
better
I
began
to
think
it
was
a
Mercy
she
had
any
features
*NL*
at
all
,
so
very
blank
and
high
was
the
dead
wall
of
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
dear
soul
!
''
said
this
lady
,
with
an
abruptness
of
manner
quite
my
*NL*
sister
's
.
``
Nobody
's
enemy
but
his
own
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
much
more
commendable
to
be
somebody
else
's
enemy
,
''
said
*NL*
the
gentleman
;
``
far
more
natural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin
Raymond
,
''
observed
another
lady
,
``
we
are
to
love
our
neighbor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sarah
Pocket
,
''
returned
Cousin
Raymond
,
``
if
a
man
is
not
his
own
*NL*
neighbor
,
who
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Pocket
laughed
,
and
Camilla
laughed
and
said
-LRB-
checking
a
yawn
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
The
idea
!
''
But
I
thought
they
seemed
to
think
it
rather
a
good
*NL*
idea
too
.
The
other
lady
,
who
had
not
spoken
yet
,
said
gravely
and
*NL*
emphatically
,
``
Very
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
soul
!
''
Camilla
presently
went
on
-LRB-
I
knew
they
had
all
been
looking
*NL*
at
me
in
the
mean
time
-RRB-
,
``
he
is
so
very
strange
!
Would
anyone
believe
*NL*
that
when
Tom
's
wife
died
,
he
actually
could
not
be
induced
to
see
the
*NL*
importance
of
the
children
's
having
the
deepest
of
trimmings
to
their
*NL*
mourning
?
`
Good
Lord
!
'
says
he
,
`
Camilla
,
what
can
it
signify
so
long
*NL*
as
the
poor
bereaved
little
things
are
in
black
?
'
So
like
Matthew
!
The
*NL*
idea

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
points
in

,
good
points
in
him
,
''
said
Cousin
Raymond
;
``
Heaven
*NL*
forbid
I
should
deny
good
points
in
him
;
but
he
never
had
,
and
he
never
*NL*
will
have
,
any
sense
of
the
proprieties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
was
obliged
,
''
said
Camilla
,
--
``
I
was
obliged
to
be
firm
.
I
*NL*
said
,
`
It
WILL
NOT
DO
,
for
the
credit
of
the
family
.
'
I
told
him
that
,
*NL*
without
deep
trimmings
,
the
family
was
disgraced
.
I
cried
about
it
from
*NL*
breakfast
till
dinner
.
I
injured
my
digestion
.
And
at
last
he
flung
out
*NL*
in
his
violent
way
,
and
said
,
with
a
D
,
`
Then
do
as
you
like
.
'
Thank
*NL*
Goodness
it
will
always
be
a
consolation
to
me
to
know
that
I
instantly
*NL*
went
out
in
a
pouring
rain
and
bought
the
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
paid
for
them
,
did
he
not
?
''
asked
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
question
,
my
dear
child
,
who
paid
for
them
,
''
returned
*NL*
Camilla
.
``
I
bought
them
.
And
I
shall
often
think
of
that
with
peace
,
*NL*
when
I
wake
up
in
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ringing
of
a
distant
bell
,
combined
with
the
echoing
of
some
cry
or
*NL*
call
along
the
passage
by
which
I
had
come
,
interrupted
the
conversation
*NL*
and
caused
Estella
to
say
to
me
,
``
Now
,
boy
!
''
On
my
turning
round
,
they
*NL*
all
looked
at
me
with
the
utmost
contempt
,
and
,
as
I
went
out
,
I
heard
*NL*
Sarah
Pocket
say
,
``
Well
I
am
sure
!
What
next
!
''
and
Camilla
add
,
with
*NL*
indignation
,
``
Was
there
ever
such
a
fancy
!
The
i-de-a
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
going
with
our
candle
along
the
dark
passage
,
Estella
stopped
*NL*
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
,
facing
round
,
said
in
her
taunting
manner
,
with
*NL*
her
face
quite
close
to
mine
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
miss
?
''
I
answered
,
almost
falling
over
her
and
checking
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
looking
at
me
,
and
,
of
course
,
I
stood
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
think
you
are
very
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
insulting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
much
so
as
you
were
last
time
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
much
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fired
when
she
asked
the
last
question
,
and
she
slapped
my
face
with
*NL*
such
force
as
she
had
,
when
I
answered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
?
''
said
she
.
``
You
little
coarse
monster
,
what
do
you
think
of
me
*NL*
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
are
going
to
tell
upstairs
.
Is
that
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
's
not
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
cry
again
,
you
little
wretch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
'll
never
cry
for
you
again
,
''
said
I.
Which
was
,
I
suppose
,
as
*NL*
false
a
declaration
as
ever
was
made
;
for
I
was
inwardly
crying
for
her
*NL*
then
,
and
I
know
what
I
know
of
the
pain
she
cost
me
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
on
our
way
upstairs
after
this
episode
;
and
,
as
we
were
going
*NL*
up
,
we
met
a
gentleman
groping
his
way
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
have
we
here
?
''
asked
the
gentleman
,
stopping
and
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
boy
,
''
said
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
burly
man
of
an
exceedingly
dark
complexion
,
with
an
*NL*
exceedingly
large
head
,
and
a
corresponding
large
hand
.
He
took
my
chin
*NL*
in
his
large
hand
and
turned
up
my
face
to
have
a
look
at
me
by
the
*NL*
light
of
the
candle
.
He
was
prematurely
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
,
and
*NL*
had
bushy
black
eyebrows
that
would
n't
lie
down
but
stood
up
bristling
.
*NL*
His
eyes
were
set
very
deep
in
his
head
,
and
were
disagreeably
sharp
and
*NL*
suspicious
.
He
had
a
large
watch-chain
,
and
strong
black
dots
where
his
*NL*
beard
and
whiskers
would
have
been
if
he
had
let
them
.
He
was
nothing
*NL*
to
me
,
and
I
could
have
had
no
foresight
then
,
that
he
ever
would
be
*NL*
anything
to
me
,
but
it
happened
that
I
had
this
opportunity
of
observing
*NL*
him
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boy
of
the
neighborhood
?
Hey
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
come
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Havisham
sent
for
me
,
sir
,
''
I
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
Behave
yourself
.
I
have
a
pretty
large
experience
of
boys
,
and
*NL*
you
're
a
bad
set
of
fellows
.
Now
mind
!
''
said
he
,
biting
the
side
of
his
*NL*
great
forefinger
as
he
frowned
at
me
,
``
you
behave
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
those
words
,
he
released
me
--
which
I
was
glad
of
,
for
his
hand
*NL*
smelt
of
scented
soap
--
and
went
his
way
downstairs
.
I
wondered
whether
*NL*
he
could
be
a
doctor
;
but
no
,
I
thought
;
he
could
n't
be
a
doctor
,
or
he
*NL*
would
have
a
quieter
and
more
persuasive
manner
.
There
was
not
much
time
*NL*
to
consider
the
subject
,
for
we
were
soon
in
Miss
Havisham
's
room
,
where
*NL*
she
and
everything
else
were
just
as
I
had
left
them
.
Estella
left
me
*NL*
standing
near
the
door
,
and
I
stood
there
until
Miss
Havisham
cast
her
*NL*
eyes
upon
me
from
the
dressing-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
!
''
she
said
,
without
being
startled
or
surprised
:
``
the
days
have
worn
*NL*
away
,
have
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
.
To-day
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
,
there
!
''
with
the
impatient
movement
of
her
fingers
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
know
.
Are
you
ready
to
play
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
answer
in
some
confusion
,
``
I
do
n't
think
I
am
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
cards
again
?
''
she
demanded
,
with
a
searching
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
;
I
could
do
that
,
if
I
was
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
this
house
strikes
you
old
and
grave
,
boy
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
*NL*
impatiently
,
``
and
you
are
unwilling
to
play
,
are
you
willing
to
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
answer
this
inquiry
with
a
better
heart
than
I
had
been
able
to
*NL*
find
for
the
other
question
,
and
I
said
I
was
quite
willing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
go
into
that
opposite
room
,
''
said
she
,
pointing
at
the
door
behind
*NL*
me
with
her
withered
hand
,
``
and
wait
there
till
I
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
crossed
the
staircase
landing
,
and
entered
the
room
she
indicated
.
*NL*
From
that
room
,
too
,
the
daylight
was
completely
excluded
,
and
it
had
an
*NL*
airless
smell
that
was
oppressive
.
A
fire
had
been
lately
kindled
in
*NL*
the
damp
old-fashioned
grate
,
and
it
was
more
disposed
to
go
out
than
*NL*
to
burn
up
,
and
the
reluctant
smoke
which
hung
in
the
room
seemed
colder
*NL*
than
the
clearer
air
,
--
like
our
own
marsh
mist
.
Certain
wintry
branches
*NL*
of
candles
on
the
high
chimney-piece
faintly
lighted
the
chamber
;
or
it
*NL*
would
be
more
expressive
to
say
,
faintly
troubled
its
darkness
.
It
was
*NL*
spacious
,
and
I
dare
say
had
once
been
handsome
,
but
every
discernible
*NL*
thing
in
it
was
covered
with
dust
and
mould
,
and
dropping
to
pieces
.
The
*NL*
most
prominent
object
was
a
long
table
with
a
tablecloth
spread
on
it
,
*NL*
as
if
a
feast
had
been
in
preparation
when
the
house
and
the
clocks
all
*NL*
stopped
together
.
An
epergne
or
centre-piece
of
some
kind
was
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
this
cloth
;
it
was
so
heavily
overhung
with
cobwebs
that
its
*NL*
form
was
quite
undistinguishable
;
and
,
as
I
looked
along
the
yellow
*NL*
expanse
out
of
which
I
remember
its
seeming
to
grow
,
like
a
black
*NL*
fungus
,
I
saw
speckle-legged
spiders
with
blotchy
bodies
running
home
*NL*
to
it
,
and
running
out
from
it
,
as
if
some
circumstances
of
the
greatest
*NL*
public
importance
had
just
transpired
in
the
spider
community
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
the
mice
too
,
rattling
behind
the
panels
,
as
if
the
same
*NL*
occurrence
were
important
to
their
interests
.
But
the
black
beetles
took
*NL*
no
notice
of
the
agitation
,
and
groped
about
the
hearth
in
a
ponderous
*NL*
elderly
way
,
as
if
they
were
short-sighted
and
hard
of
hearing
,
and
not
*NL*
on
terms
with
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
crawling
things
had
fascinated
my
attention
,
and
I
was
watching
*NL*
them
from
a
distance
,
when
Miss
Havisham
laid
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
.
*NL*
In
her
other
hand
she
had
a
crutch-headed
stick
on
which
she
leaned
,
and
*NL*
she
looked
like
the
Witch
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
said
she
,
pointing
to
the
long
table
with
her
stick
,
``
is
where
I
*NL*
will
be
laid
when
I
am
dead
.
They
shall
come
and
look
at
me
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
some
vague
misgiving
that
she
might
get
upon
the
table
then
and
*NL*
there
and
die
at
once
,
the
complete
realization
of
the
ghastly
waxwork
*NL*
at
the
Fair
,
I
shrank
under
her
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
that
is
?
''
she
asked
me
,
again
pointing
with
her
*NL*
stick
;
``
that
,
where
those
cobwebs
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
guess
what
it
is
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
great
cake
.
A
bride-cake
.
Mine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
all
round
the
room
in
a
glaring
manner
,
and
then
said
,
*NL*
leaning
on
me
while
her
hand
twitched
my
shoulder
,
``
Come
,
come
,
come
!
*NL*
Walk
me
,
walk
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
out
from
this
,
that
the
work
I
had
to
do
,
was
to
walk
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
round
and
round
the
room
.
Accordingly
,
I
started
at
once
,
and
*NL*
she
leaned
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
we
went
away
at
a
pace
that
might
have
*NL*
been
an
imitation
-LRB-
founded
on
my
first
impulse
under
that
roof
-RRB-
of
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
's
chaise-cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
physically
strong
,
and
after
a
little
time
said
,
``
Slower
!
''
*NL*
Still
,
we
went
at
an
impatient
fitful
speed
,
and
as
we
went
,
she
*NL*
twitched
the
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
worked
her
mouth
,
and
led
me
to
*NL*
believe
that
we
were
going
fast
because
her
thoughts
went
fast
.
After
a
*NL*
while
she
said
,
``
Call
Estella
!
''
so
I
went
out
on
the
landing
and
*NL*
roared
that
name
as
I
had
done
on
the
previous
occasion
.
When
her
light
*NL*
appeared
,
I
returned
to
Miss
Havisham
,
and
we
started
away
again
round
*NL*
and
round
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
only
Estella
had
come
to
be
a
spectator
of
our
proceedings
,
I
should
*NL*
have
felt
sufficiently
discontented
;
but
as
she
brought
with
her
the
*NL*
three
ladies
and
the
gentleman
whom
I
had
seen
below
,
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
do
.
In
my
politeness
,
I
would
have
stopped
;
but
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
twitched
my
shoulder
,
and
we
posted
on
,
--
with
a
shame-faced
*NL*
consciousness
on
my
part
that
they
would
think
it
was
all
my
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Miss
Havisham
,
''
said
Miss
Sarah
Pocket
.
``
How
well
you
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
,
''
returned
Miss
Havisham
.
``
I
am
yellow
skin
and
bone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Camilla
brightened
when
Miss
Pocket
met
with
this
rebuff
;
and
she
*NL*
murmured
,
as
she
plaintively
contemplated
Miss
Havisham
,
``
Poor
dear
*NL*
soul
!
Certainly
not
to
be
expected
to
look
well
,
poor
thing
.
The
idea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
are
you
?
''
said
Miss
Havisham
to
Camilla
.
As
we
were
close
to
*NL*
Camilla
then
,
I
would
have
stopped
as
a
matter
of
course
,
only
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
would
n't
stop
.
We
swept
on
,
and
I
felt
that
I
was
highly
*NL*
obnoxious
to
Camilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Miss
Havisham
,
''
she
returned
,
``
I
am
as
well
as
can
be
*NL*
expected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
asked
Miss
Havisham
,
with
exceeding
*NL*
sharpness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
worth
mentioning
,
''
replied
Camilla
.
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
make
a
*NL*
display
of
my
feelings
,
but
I
have
habitually
thought
of
you
more
in
the
*NL*
night
than
I
am
quite
equal
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
think
of
me
,
''
retorted
Miss
Havisham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
easily
said
!
''
remarked
Camilla
,
amiably
repressing
a
sob
,
while
a
*NL*
hitch
came
into
her
upper
lip
,
and
her
tears
overflowed
.
``
Raymond
is
a
*NL*
witness
what
ginger
and
sal
volatile
I
am
obliged
to
take
in
the
night
.
*NL*
Raymond
is
a
witness
what
nervous
jerkings
I
have
in
my
legs
.
Chokings
*NL*
and
nervous
jerkings
,
however
,
are
nothing
new
to
me
when
I
think
with
*NL*
anxiety
of
those
I
love
.
If
I
could
be
less
affectionate
and
sensitive
,
*NL*
I
should
have
a
better
digestion
and
an
iron
set
of
nerves
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
I
wish
it
could
be
so
.
But
as
to
not
thinking
of
you
in
the
night
--
The
*NL*
idea
!
''
Here
,
a
burst
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Raymond
referred
to
,
I
understood
to
be
the
gentleman
present
,
and
*NL*
him
I
understood
to
be
Mr.
Camilla
.
He
came
to
the
rescue
at
this
point
,
*NL*
and
said
in
a
consolatory
and
complimentary
voice
,
``
Camilla
,
my
dear
,
it
*NL*
is
well
known
that
your
family
feelings
are
gradually
undermining
you
to
*NL*
the
extent
of
making
one
of
your
legs
shorter
than
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
aware
,
''
observed
the
grave
lady
whose
voice
I
had
heard
but
*NL*
once
,
``
that
to
think
of
any
person
is
to
make
a
great
claim
upon
that
*NL*
person
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Sarah
Pocket
,
whom
I
now
saw
to
be
a
little
dry
,
brown
,
corrugated
*NL*
old
woman
,
with
a
small
face
that
might
have
been
made
of
walnut-shells
,
*NL*
and
a
large
mouth
like
a
cat
's
without
the
whiskers
,
supported
this
*NL*
position
by
saying
,
``
No
,
indeed
,
my
dear
.
Hem
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thinking
is
easy
enough
,
''
said
the
grave
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
easier
,
you
know
?
''
assented
Miss
Sarah
Pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
!
''
cried
Camilla
,
whose
fermenting
feelings
appeared
to
*NL*
rise
from
her
legs
to
her
bosom
.
``
It
's
all
very
true
!
It
's
a
weakness
*NL*
to
be
so
affectionate
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
No
doubt
my
health
would
be
*NL*
much
better
if
it
was
otherwise
,
still
I
would
n't
change
my
disposition
*NL*
if
I
could
.
It
's
the
cause
of
much
suffering
,
but
it
's
a
consolation
to
*NL*
know
I
posses
it
,
when
I
wake
up
in
the
night
.
''
Here
another
burst
of
*NL*
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
and
I
had
never
stopped
all
this
time
,
but
kept
going
*NL*
round
and
round
the
room
;
now
brushing
against
the
skirts
of
the
*NL*
visitors
,
now
giving
them
the
whole
length
of
the
dismal
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Matthew
!
''
said
Camilla
.
``
Never
mixing
with
any
natural
ties
,
*NL*
never
coming
here
to
see
how
Miss
Havisham
is
!
I
have
taken
to
the
sofa
*NL*
with
my
staylace
cut
,
and
have
lain
there
hours
insensible
,
with
my
head
*NL*
over
the
side
,
and
my
hair
all
down
,
and
my
feet
I
do
n't
know
where
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Much
higher
than
your
head
,
my
love
,
''
said
Mr.
Camilla
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
gone
off
into
that
state
,
hours
and
hours
,
on
account
of
*NL*
Matthew
's
strange
and
inexplicable
conduct
,
and
nobody
has
thanked
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
I
must
say
I
should
think
not
!
''
interposed
the
grave
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
dear
,
''
added
Miss
Sarah
Pocket
-LRB-
a
blandly
vicious
*NL*
personage
-RRB-
,
``
the
question
to
put
to
yourself
is
,
who
did
you
expect
to
*NL*
thank
you
,
my
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
expecting
any
thanks
,
or
anything
of
the
sort
,
''
resumed
*NL*
Camilla
,
``
I
have
remained
in
that
state
,
hours
and
hours
,
and
Raymond
*NL*
is
a
witness
of
the
extent
to
which
I
have
choked
,
and
what
the
total
*NL*
inefficacy
of
ginger
has
been
,
and
I
have
been
heard
at
the
piano-forte
*NL*
tuner
's
across
the
street
,
where
the
poor
mistaken
children
have
even
*NL*
supposed
it
to
be
pigeons
cooing
at
a
distance
,
--
and
now
to
be
told
--
''
*NL*
Here
Camilla
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
,
and
began
to
be
quite
chemical
*NL*
as
to
the
formation
of
new
combinations
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
same
Matthew
was
mentioned
,
Miss
Havisham
stopped
me
and
*NL*
herself
,
and
stood
looking
at
the
speaker
.
This
change
had
a
great
*NL*
influence
in
bringing
Camilla
's
chemistry
to
a
sudden
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
will
come
and
see
me
at
last
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
sternly
,
*NL*
``
when
I
am
laid
on
that
table
.
That
will
be
his
place
,
--
there
,
''
striking
*NL*
the
table
with
her
stick
,
``
at
my
head
!
And
yours
will
be
there
!
And
your
*NL*
husband
's
there
!
And
Sarah
Pocket
's
there
!
And
Georgiana
's
there
!
Now
*NL*
you
all
know
where
to
take
your
stations
when
you
come
to
feast
upon
me
.
*NL*
And
now
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
mention
of
each
name
,
she
had
struck
the
table
with
her
stick
in
*NL*
a
new
place
.
She
now
said
,
``
Walk
me
,
walk
me
!
''
and
we
went
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
there
's
nothing
to
be
done
,
''
exclaimed
Camilla
,
``
but
comply
*NL*
and
depart
.
It
's
something
to
have
seen
the
object
of
one
's
love
and
*NL*
duty
for
even
so
short
a
time
.
I
shall
think
of
it
with
a
melancholy
*NL*
satisfaction
when
I
wake
up
in
the
night
.
I
wish
Matthew
could
have
*NL*
that
comfort
,
but
he
sets
it
at
defiance
.
I
am
determined
not
to
make
a
*NL*
display
of
my
feelings
,
but
it
's
very
hard
to
be
told
one
wants
to
feast
*NL*
on
one
's
relations
,
--
as
if
one
was
a
Giant
,
--
and
to
be
told
to
go
.
The
*NL*
bare
idea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Camilla
interposing
,
as
Mrs.
Camilla
laid
her
hand
upon
her
heaving
*NL*
bosom
,
that
lady
assumed
an
unnatural
fortitude
of
manner
which
I
*NL*
supposed
to
be
expressive
of
an
intention
to
drop
and
choke
when
out
of
*NL*
view
,
and
kissing
her
hand
to
Miss
Havisham
,
was
escorted
forth
.
Sarah
*NL*
Pocket
and
Georgiana
contended
who
should
remain
last
;
but
Sarah
was
*NL*
too
knowing
to
be
outdone
,
and
ambled
round
Georgiana
with
that
artful
*NL*
slipperiness
that
the
latter
was
obliged
to
take
precedence
.
Sarah
*NL*
Pocket
then
made
her
separate
effect
of
departing
with
,
``
Bless
you
,
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
dear
!
''
and
with
a
smile
of
forgiving
pity
on
her
walnut-shell
*NL*
countenance
for
the
weaknesses
of
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Estella
was
away
lighting
them
down
,
Miss
Havisham
still
walked
*NL*
with
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
but
more
and
more
slowly
.
At
last
she
*NL*
stopped
before
the
fire
,
and
said
,
after
muttering
and
looking
at
it
*NL*
some
seconds
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
birthday
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
to
wish
her
many
happy
returns
,
when
she
lifted
her
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suffer
it
to
be
spoken
of
.
I
do
n't
suffer
those
who
were
here
*NL*
just
now
,
or
any
one
to
speak
of
it
.
They
come
here
on
the
day
,
but
they
*NL*
dare
not
refer
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
made
no
further
effort
to
refer
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
this
day
of
the
year
,
long
before
you
were
born
,
this
heap
of
*NL*
decay
,
''
stabbing
with
her
crutched
stick
at
the
pile
of
cobwebs
on
the
*NL*
table
,
but
not
touching
it
,
``
was
brought
here
.
It
and
I
have
worn
away
*NL*
together
.
The
mice
have
gnawed
at
it
,
and
sharper
teeth
than
teeth
of
*NL*
mice
have
gnawed
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
the
head
of
her
stick
against
her
heart
as
she
stood
looking
*NL*
at
the
table
;
she
in
her
once
white
dress
,
all
yellow
and
withered
;
the
*NL*
once
white
cloth
all
yellow
and
withered
;
everything
around
in
a
state
*NL*
to
crumble
under
a
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
ruin
is
complete
,
''
said
she
,
with
a
ghastly
look
,
``
and
when
*NL*
they
lay
me
dead
,
in
my
bride
's
dress
on
the
bride
's
table
,
--
which
shall
*NL*
be
done
,
and
which
will
be
the
finished
curse
upon
him
,
--
so
much
the
*NL*
better
if
it
is
done
on
this
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
looking
at
the
table
as
if
she
stood
looking
at
her
own
figure
*NL*
lying
there
.
I
remained
quiet
.
Estella
returned
,
and
she
too
remained
*NL*
quiet
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
we
continued
thus
for
a
long
time
.
In
*NL*
the
heavy
air
of
the
room
,
and
the
heavy
darkness
that
brooded
in
its
*NL*
remoter
corners
,
I
even
had
an
alarming
fancy
that
Estella
and
I
might
*NL*
presently
begin
to
decay
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
not
coming
out
of
her
distraught
state
by
degrees
,
but
in
an
*NL*
instant
,
Miss
Havisham
said
,
``
Let
me
see
you
two
play
cards
;
why
have
*NL*
you
not
begun
?
''
With
that
,
we
returned
to
her
room
,
and
sat
down
as
*NL*
before
;
I
was
beggared
,
as
before
;
and
again
,
as
before
,
Miss
Havisham
*NL*
watched
us
all
the
time
,
directed
my
attention
to
Estella
's
beauty
,
and
*NL*
made
me
notice
it
the
more
by
trying
her
jewels
on
Estella
's
breast
and
*NL*
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Estella
,
for
her
part
,
likewise
treated
me
as
before
,
except
that
she
*NL*
did
not
condescend
to
speak
.
When
we
had
played
some
half-dozen
games
,
*NL*
a
day
was
appointed
for
my
return
,
and
I
was
taken
down
into
the
yard
*NL*
to
be
fed
in
the
former
dog-like
manner
.
There
,
too
,
I
was
again
left
to
*NL*
wander
about
as
I
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
much
to
the
purpose
whether
a
gate
in
that
garden
wall
which
*NL*
I
had
scrambled
up
to
peep
over
on
the
last
occasion
was
,
on
that
last
*NL*
occasion
,
open
or
shut
.
Enough
that
I
saw
no
gate
then
,
and
that
I
*NL*
saw
one
now
.
As
it
stood
open
,
and
as
I
knew
that
Estella
had
let
*NL*
the
visitors
out
,
--
for
she
had
returned
with
the
keys
in
her
hand
,
--
I
*NL*
strolled
into
the
garden
,
and
strolled
all
over
it
.
It
was
quite
a
*NL*
wilderness
,
and
there
were
old
melon-frames
and
cucumber-frames
in
it
,
*NL*
which
seemed
in
their
decline
to
have
produced
a
spontaneous
growth
of
*NL*
weak
attempts
at
pieces
of
old
hats
and
boots
,
with
now
and
then
a
weedy
*NL*
offshoot
into
the
likeness
of
a
battered
saucepan
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
exhausted
the
garden
and
a
greenhouse
with
nothing
in
it
but
*NL*
a
fallen-down
grape-vine
and
some
bottles
,
I
found
myself
in
the
dismal
*NL*
corner
upon
which
I
had
looked
out
of
the
window
.
Never
questioning
for
*NL*
a
moment
that
the
house
was
now
empty
,
I
looked
in
at
another
window
,
*NL*
and
found
myself
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
exchanging
a
broad
stare
with
a
*NL*
pale
young
gentleman
with
red
eyelids
and
light
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
pale
young
gentleman
quickly
disappeared
,
and
reappeared
beside
me
.
*NL*
He
had
been
at
his
books
when
I
had
found
myself
staring
at
him
,
and
I
*NL*
now
saw
that
he
was
inky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
''
said
he
,
``
young
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Halloa
being
a
general
observation
which
I
had
usually
observed
to
*NL*
be
best
answered
by
itself
,
I
said
,
``
Halloa
!
''
politely
omitting
young
*NL*
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
let
you
in
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Estella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
gave
you
leave
to
prowl
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Estella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
fight
,
''
said
the
pale
young
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
I
do
but
follow
him
?
I
have
often
asked
myself
the
question
*NL*
since
;
but
what
else
could
I
do
?
His
manner
was
so
final
,
and
I
was
*NL*
so
astonished
,
that
I
followed
where
he
led
,
as
if
I
had
been
under
a
*NL*
spell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
minute
,
though
,
''
he
said
,
wheeling
round
before
we
had
gone
many
*NL*
paces
.
``
I
ought
to
give
you
a
reason
for
fighting
,
too
.
There
it
is
!
''
*NL*
In
a
most
irritating
manner
he
instantly
slapped
his
hands
against
one
*NL*
another
,
daintily
flung
one
of
his
legs
up
behind
him
,
pulled
my
hair
,
*NL*
slapped
his
hands
again
,
dipped
his
head
,
and
butted
it
into
my
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bull-like
proceeding
last
mentioned
,
besides
that
it
was
*NL*
unquestionably
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
liberty
,
was
*NL*
particularly
disagreeable
just
after
bread
and
meat
.
I
therefore
hit
out
*NL*
at
him
and
was
going
to
hit
out
again
,
when
he
said
,
``
Aha
!
Would
you
?
''
*NL*
and
began
dancing
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
manner
quite
unparalleled
*NL*
within
my
limited
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laws
of
the
game
!
''
said
he
.
Here
,
he
skipped
from
his
left
leg
on
to
*NL*
his
right
.
``
Regular
rules
!
''
Here
,
he
skipped
from
his
right
leg
on
to
*NL*
his
left
.
``
Come
to
the
ground
,
and
go
through
the
preliminaries
!
''
Here
,
*NL*
he
dodged
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
did
all
sorts
of
things
while
I
*NL*
looked
helplessly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
secretly
afraid
of
him
when
I
saw
him
so
dexterous
;
but
I
felt
*NL*
morally
and
physically
convinced
that
his
light
head
of
hair
could
have
*NL*
had
no
business
in
the
pit
of
my
stomach
,
and
that
I
had
a
right
to
*NL*
consider
it
irrelevant
when
so
obtruded
on
my
attention
.
Therefore
,
I
*NL*
followed
him
without
a
word
,
to
a
retired
nook
of
the
garden
,
formed
by
*NL*
the
junction
of
two
walls
and
screened
by
some
rubbish
.
On
his
asking
me
*NL*
if
I
was
satisfied
with
the
ground
,
and
on
my
replying
Yes
,
he
begged
my
*NL*
leave
to
absent
himself
for
a
moment
,
and
quickly
returned
with
a
bottle
*NL*
of
water
and
a
sponge
dipped
in
vinegar
.
``
Available
for
both
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
placing
these
against
the
wall
.
And
then
fell
to
pulling
off
,
not
*NL*
only
his
jacket
and
waistcoat
,
but
his
shirt
too
,
in
a
manner
at
once
*NL*
light-hearted
,
business-like
,
and
bloodthirsty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
he
did
not
look
very
healthy
,
--
having
pimples
on
his
face
,
and
*NL*
a
breaking
out
at
his
mouth
,
--
these
dreadful
preparations
quite
appalled
*NL*
me
.
I
judged
him
to
be
about
my
own
age
,
but
he
was
much
taller
,
and
he
*NL*
had
a
way
of
spinning
himself
about
that
was
full
of
appearance
.
For
*NL*
the
rest
,
he
was
a
young
gentleman
in
a
gray
suit
-LRB-
when
not
denuded
*NL*
for
battle
-RRB-
,
with
his
elbows
,
knees
,
wrists
,
and
heels
considerably
in
*NL*
advance
of
the
rest
of
him
as
to
development
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
failed
me
when
I
saw
him
squaring
at
me
with
every
*NL*
demonstration
of
mechanical
nicety
,
and
eyeing
my
anatomy
as
if
he
were
*NL*
minutely
choosing
his
bone
.
I
never
have
been
so
surprised
in
my
life
,
*NL*
as
I
was
when
I
let
out
the
first
blow
,
and
saw
him
lying
on
his
*NL*
back
,
looking
up
at
me
with
a
bloody
nose
and
his
face
exceedingly
*NL*
fore-shortened
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
he
was
on
his
feet
directly
,
and
after
sponging
himself
with
*NL*
a
great
show
of
dexterity
began
squaring
again
.
The
second
greatest
*NL*
surprise
I
have
ever
had
in
my
life
was
seeing
him
on
his
back
again
,
*NL*
looking
up
at
me
out
of
a
black
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
spirit
inspired
me
with
great
respect
.
He
seemed
to
have
no
*NL*
strength
,
and
he
never
once
hit
me
hard
,
and
he
was
always
knocked
down
;
*NL*
but
he
would
be
up
again
in
a
moment
,
sponging
himself
or
drinking
out
*NL*
of
the
water-bottle
,
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
seconding
himself
*NL*
according
to
form
,
and
then
came
at
me
with
an
air
and
a
show
that
made
*NL*
me
believe
he
really
was
going
to
do
for
me
at
last
.
He
got
heavily
*NL*
bruised
,
for
I
am
sorry
to
record
that
the
more
I
hit
him
,
the
harder
I
*NL*
hit
him
;
but
he
came
up
again
and
again
and
again
,
until
at
last
he
got
*NL*
a
bad
fall
with
the
back
of
his
head
against
the
wall
.
Even
after
that
*NL*
crisis
in
our
affairs
,
he
got
up
and
turned
round
and
round
confusedly
a
*NL*
few
times
,
not
knowing
where
I
was
;
but
finally
went
on
his
knees
to
his
*NL*
sponge
and
threw
it
up
:
at
the
same
time
panting
out
,
``
That
means
you
*NL*
have
won
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
so
brave
and
innocent
,
that
although
I
had
not
proposed
the
*NL*
contest
,
I
felt
but
a
gloomy
satisfaction
in
my
victory
.
Indeed
,
I
go
*NL*
so
far
as
to
hope
that
I
regarded
myself
while
dressing
as
a
species
of
*NL*
savage
young
wolf
or
other
wild
beast
.
However
,
I
got
dressed
,
darkly
*NL*
wiping
my
sanguinary
face
at
intervals
,
and
I
said
,
``
Can
I
help
you
?
''
*NL*
and
he
said
``
No
thankee
,
''
and
I
said
``
Good
afternoon
,
''
and
he
said
``
Same
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
into
the
courtyard
,
I
found
Estella
waiting
with
the
keys
.
*NL*
But
she
neither
asked
me
where
I
had
been
,
nor
why
I
had
kept
her
*NL*
waiting
;
and
there
was
a
bright
flush
upon
her
face
,
as
though
something
*NL*
had
happened
to
delight
her
.
Instead
of
going
straight
to
the
gate
,
too
,
*NL*
she
stepped
back
into
the
passage
,
and
beckoned
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
!
You
may
kiss
me
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
kissed
her
cheek
as
she
turned
it
to
me
.
I
think
I
would
have
gone
*NL*
through
a
great
deal
to
kiss
her
cheek
.
But
I
felt
that
the
kiss
was
*NL*
given
to
the
coarse
common
boy
as
a
piece
of
money
might
have
been
,
and
*NL*
that
it
was
worth
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
with
the
birthday
visitors
,
and
what
with
the
cards
,
and
what
with
*NL*
the
fight
,
my
stay
had
lasted
so
long
,
that
when
I
neared
home
the
light
*NL*
on
the
spit
of
sand
off
the
point
on
the
marshes
was
gleaming
against
*NL*
a
black
night-sky
,
and
Joe
's
furnace
was
flinging
a
path
of
fire
across
*NL*
the
road
.

Chapter
XII
*NL*
*NL*
My
mind
grew
very
uneasy
on
the
subject
of
the
pale
young
gentleman
.
The
*NL*
more
I
thought
of
the
fight
,
and
recalled
the
pale
young
gentleman
on
*NL*
his
back
in
various
stages
of
puffy
and
incrimsoned
countenance
,
the
*NL*
more
certain
it
appeared
that
something
would
be
done
to
me
.
I
felt
that
*NL*
the
pale
young
gentleman
's
blood
was
on
my
head
,
and
that
the
Law
would
*NL*
avenge
it
.
Without
having
any
definite
idea
of
the
penalties
I
had
*NL*
incurred
,
it
was
clear
to
me
that
village
boys
could
not
go
stalking
*NL*
about
the
country
,
ravaging
the
houses
of
gentlefolks
and
pitching
into
*NL*
the
studious
youth
of
England
,
without
laying
themselves
open
to
severe
*NL*
punishment
.
For
some
days
,
I
even
kept
close
at
home
,
and
looked
out
at
*NL*
the
kitchen
door
with
the
greatest
caution
and
trepidation
before
going
*NL*
on
an
errand
,
lest
the
officers
of
the
County
Jail
should
pounce
upon
*NL*
me
.
The
pale
young
gentleman
's
nose
had
stained
my
trousers
,
and
I
tried
*NL*
to
wash
out
that
evidence
of
my
guilt
in
the
dead
of
night
.
I
had
cut
*NL*
my
knuckles
against
the
pale
young
gentleman
's
teeth
,
and
I
twisted
my
*NL*
imagination
into
a
thousand
tangles
,
as
I
devised
incredible
ways
of
*NL*
accounting
for
that
damnatory
circumstance
when
I
should
be
haled
before
*NL*
the
Judges
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
day
came
round
for
my
return
to
the
scene
of
the
deed
of
*NL*
violence
,
my
terrors
reached
their
height
.
Whether
myrmidons
of
Justice
,
*NL*
specially
sent
down
from
London
,
would
be
lying
in
ambush
behind
the
*NL*
gate
;
--
whether
Miss
Havisham
,
preferring
to
take
personal
vengeance
for
*NL*
an
outrage
done
to
her
house
,
might
rise
in
those
grave-clothes
of
hers
,
*NL*
draw
a
pistol
,
and
shoot
me
dead
:
--
whether
suborned
boys
--
a
numerous
*NL*
band
of
mercenaries
--
might
be
engaged
to
fall
upon
me
in
the
brewery
,
*NL*
and
cuff
me
until
I
was
no
more
;
--
it
was
high
testimony
to
my
confidence
*NL*
in
the
spirit
of
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
that
I
never
imagined
him
*NL*
accessory
to
these
retaliations
;
they
always
came
into
my
mind
as
the
*NL*
acts
of
injudicious
relatives
of
his
,
goaded
on
by
the
state
of
his
*NL*
visage
and
an
indignant
sympathy
with
the
family
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
go
to
Miss
Havisham
's
I
must
,
and
go
I
did
.
And
behold
!
nothing
*NL*
came
of
the
late
struggle
.
It
was
not
alluded
to
in
any
way
,
and
no
pale
*NL*
young
gentleman
was
to
be
discovered
on
the
premises
.
I
found
the
same
*NL*
gate
open
,
and
I
explored
the
garden
,
and
even
looked
in
at
the
windows
*NL*
of
the
detached
house
;
but
my
view
was
suddenly
stopped
by
the
closed
*NL*
shutters
within
,
and
all
was
lifeless
.
Only
in
the
corner
where
*NL*
the
combat
had
taken
place
could
I
detect
any
evidence
of
the
young
*NL*
gentleman
's
existence
.
There
were
traces
of
his
gore
in
that
spot
,
and
I
*NL*
covered
them
with
garden-mould
from
the
eye
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
broad
landing
between
Miss
Havisham
's
own
room
and
that
other
*NL*
room
in
which
the
long
table
was
laid
out
,
I
saw
a
garden-chair
,
--
a
*NL*
light
chair
on
wheels
,
that
you
pushed
from
behind
.
It
had
been
placed
*NL*
there
since
my
last
visit
,
and
I
entered
,
that
same
day
,
on
a
regular
*NL*
occupation
of
pushing
Miss
Havisham
in
this
chair
-LRB-
when
she
was
tired
of
*NL*
walking
with
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
-RRB-
round
her
own
room
,
and
across
*NL*
the
landing
,
and
round
the
other
room
.
Over
and
over
and
over
again
,
*NL*
we
would
make
these
journeys
,
and
sometimes
they
would
last
as
long
as
*NL*
three
hours
at
a
stretch
.
I
insensibly
fall
into
a
general
mention
of
*NL*
these
journeys
as
numerous
,
because
it
was
at
once
settled
that
I
should
*NL*
return
every
alternate
day
at
noon
for
these
purposes
,
and
because
I
am
*NL*
now
going
to
sum
up
a
period
of
at
least
eight
or
ten
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
began
to
be
more
used
to
one
another
,
Miss
Havisham
talked
more
*NL*
to
me
,
and
asked
me
such
questions
as
what
had
I
learnt
and
what
was
*NL*
I
going
to
be
?
I
told
her
I
was
going
to
be
apprenticed
to
Joe
,
I
*NL*
believed
;
and
I
enlarged
upon
my
knowing
nothing
and
wanting
to
know
*NL*
everything
,
in
the
hope
that
she
might
offer
some
help
towards
that
*NL*
desirable
end
.
But
she
did
not
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
seemed
to
prefer
my
*NL*
being
ignorant
.
Neither
did
she
ever
give
me
any
money
,
--
or
anything
*NL*
but
my
daily
dinner
,
--
nor
ever
stipulate
that
I
should
be
paid
for
my
*NL*
services
.
*NL*
*NL*
Estella
was
always
about
,
and
always
let
me
in
and
out
,
but
never
told
*NL*
me
I
might
kiss
her
again
.
Sometimes
,
she
would
coldly
tolerate
me
;
*NL*
sometimes
,
she
would
condescend
to
me
;
sometimes
,
she
would
be
quite
*NL*
familiar
with
me
;
sometimes
,
she
would
tell
me
energetically
that
she
*NL*
hated
me
.
Miss
Havisham
would
often
ask
me
in
a
whisper
,
or
when
we
were
*NL*
alone
,
``
Does
she
grow
prettier
and
prettier
,
Pip
?
''
And
when
I
said
yes
*NL*
-LRB-
for
indeed
she
did
-RRB-
,
would
seem
to
enjoy
it
greedily
.
Also
,
when
we
*NL*
played
at
cards
Miss
Havisham
would
look
on
,
with
a
miserly
relish
of
*NL*
Estella
's
moods
,
whatever
they
were
.
And
sometimes
,
when
her
moods
were
*NL*
so
many
and
so
contradictory
of
one
another
that
I
was
puzzled
what
*NL*
to
say
or
do
,
Miss
Havisham
would
embrace
her
with
lavish
fondness
,
*NL*
murmuring
something
in
her
ear
that
sounded
like
``
Break
their
hearts
my
*NL*
pride
and
hope
,
break
their
hearts
and
have
no
mercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
song
Joe
used
to
hum
fragments
of
at
the
forge
,
of
which
the
*NL*
burden
was
Old
Clem
.
This
was
not
a
very
ceremonious
way
of
rendering
*NL*
homage
to
a
patron
saint
,
but
I
believe
Old
Clem
stood
in
that
relation
*NL*
towards
smiths
.
It
was
a
song
that
imitated
the
measure
of
beating
upon
*NL*
iron
,
and
was
a
mere
lyrical
excuse
for
the
introduction
of
Old
Clem
's
*NL*
respected
name
.
Thus
,
you
were
to
hammer
boys
round
--
Old
Clem
!
With
a
*NL*
thump
and
a
sound
--
Old
Clem
!
Beat
it
out
,
beat
it
out
--
Old
Clem
!
With
a
*NL*
clink
for
the
stout
--
Old
Clem
!
Blow
the
fire
,
blow
the
fire
--
Old
*NL*
Clem
!
Roaring
dryer
,
soaring
higher
--
Old
Clem
!
One
day
soon
after
the
*NL*
appearance
of
the
chair
,
Miss
Havisham
suddenly
saying
to
me
,
with
the
*NL*
impatient
movement
of
her
fingers
,
``
There
,
there
,
there
!
Sing
!
''
I
was
*NL*
surprised
into
crooning
this
ditty
as
I
pushed
her
over
the
floor
.
It
*NL*
happened
so
to
catch
her
fancy
that
she
took
it
up
in
a
low
brooding
*NL*
voice
as
if
she
were
singing
in
her
sleep
.
After
that
,
it
became
*NL*
customary
with
us
to
have
it
as
we
moved
about
,
and
Estella
would
often
*NL*
join
in
;
though
the
whole
strain
was
so
subdued
,
even
when
there
were
*NL*
three
of
us
,
that
it
made
less
noise
in
the
grim
old
house
than
the
*NL*
lightest
breath
of
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
I
become
with
these
surroundings
?
How
could
my
character
fail
*NL*
to
be
influenced
by
them
?
Is
it
to
be
wondered
at
if
my
thoughts
were
*NL*
dazed
,
as
my
eyes
were
,
when
I
came
out
into
the
natural
light
from
the
*NL*
misty
yellow
rooms
?
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
I
might
have
told
Joe
about
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
if
I
had
*NL*
not
previously
been
betrayed
into
those
enormous
inventions
to
which
*NL*
I
had
confessed
.
Under
the
circumstances
,
I
felt
that
Joe
could
hardly
*NL*
fail
to
discern
in
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
an
appropriate
passenger
*NL*
to
be
put
into
the
black
velvet
coach
;
therefore
,
I
said
nothing
of
him
.
*NL*
Besides
,
that
shrinking
from
having
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
discussed
,
*NL*
which
had
come
upon
me
in
the
beginning
,
grew
much
more
potent
as
time
*NL*
went
on
.
I
reposed
complete
confidence
in
no
one
but
Biddy
;
but
I
told
*NL*
poor
Biddy
everything
.
Why
it
came
natural
to
me
to
do
so
,
and
why
Biddy
*NL*
had
a
deep
concern
in
everything
I
told
her
,
I
did
not
know
then
,
though
*NL*
I
think
I
know
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
councils
went
on
in
the
kitchen
at
home
,
fraught
with
*NL*
almost
insupportable
aggravation
to
my
exasperated
spirit
.
That
ass
,
*NL*
Pumblechook
,
used
often
to
come
over
of
a
night
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
discussing
my
prospects
with
my
sister
;
and
I
really
do
believe
-LRB-
to
*NL*
this
hour
with
less
penitence
than
I
ought
to
feel
-RRB-
,
that
if
these
hands
*NL*
could
have
taken
a
linchpin
out
of
his
chaise-cart
,
they
would
have
done
*NL*
it
.
The
miserable
man
was
a
man
of
that
confined
stolidity
of
mind
,
that
*NL*
he
could
not
discuss
my
prospects
without
having
me
before
him
,
--
as
it
*NL*
were
,
to
operate
upon
,
--
and
he
would
drag
me
up
from
my
stool
-LRB-
usually
*NL*
by
the
collar
-RRB-
where
I
was
quiet
in
a
corner
,
and
,
putting
me
before
the
*NL*
fire
as
if
I
were
going
to
be
cooked
,
would
begin
by
saying
,
``
Now
,
Mum
,
*NL*
here
is
this
boy
!
Here
is
this
boy
which
you
brought
up
by
hand
.
Hold
up
*NL*
your
head
,
boy
,
and
be
forever
grateful
unto
them
which
so
did
do
.
Now
,
*NL*
Mum
,
with
respections
to
this
boy
!
''
And
then
he
would
rumple
my
hair
*NL*
the
wrong
way
,
--
which
from
my
earliest
remembrance
,
as
already
hinted
,
*NL*
I
have
in
my
soul
denied
the
right
of
any
fellow-creature
to
do
,
--
and
*NL*
would
hold
me
before
him
by
the
sleeve
,
--
a
spectacle
of
imbecility
only
*NL*
to
be
equalled
by
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
he
and
my
sister
would
pair
off
in
such
nonsensical
speculations
*NL*
about
Miss
Havisham
,
and
about
what
she
would
do
with
me
and
for
me
,
*NL*
that
I
used
to
want
--
quite
painfully
--
to
burst
into
spiteful
tears
,
fly
*NL*
at
Pumblechook
,
and
pummel
him
all
over
.
In
these
dialogues
,
my
sister
*NL*
spoke
to
me
as
if
she
were
morally
wrenching
one
of
my
teeth
out
at
*NL*
every
reference
;
while
Pumblechook
himself
,
self-constituted
my
patron
,
*NL*
would
sit
supervising
me
with
a
depreciatory
eye
,
like
the
architect
of
*NL*
my
fortunes
who
thought
himself
engaged
on
a
very
unremunerative
job
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
discussions
,
Joe
bore
no
part
.
But
he
was
often
talked
at
,
*NL*
while
they
were
in
progress
,
by
reason
of
Mrs.
Joe
's
perceiving
that
*NL*
he
was
not
favorable
to
my
being
taken
from
the
forge
.
I
was
fully
old
*NL*
enough
now
to
be
apprenticed
to
Joe
;
and
when
Joe
sat
with
the
poker
on
*NL*
his
knees
thoughtfully
raking
out
the
ashes
between
the
lower
bars
,
my
*NL*
sister
would
so
distinctly
construe
that
innocent
action
into
opposition
*NL*
on
his
part
,
that
she
would
dive
at
him
,
take
the
poker
out
of
his
*NL*
hands
,
shake
him
,
and
put
it
away
.
There
was
a
most
irritating
end
to
*NL*
every
one
of
these
debates
.
All
in
a
moment
,
with
nothing
to
lead
up
to
*NL*
it
,
my
sister
would
stop
herself
in
a
yawn
,
and
catching
sight
of
me
as
*NL*
it
were
incidentally
,
would
swoop
upon
me
with
,
``
Come
!
there
's
enough
of
*NL*
you
!
You
get
along
to
bed
;
you
've
given
trouble
enough
for
one
night
,
I
*NL*
hope
!
''
As
if
I
had
besought
them
as
a
favor
to
bother
my
life
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
,
and
it
seemed
likely
that
we
*NL*
should
continue
to
go
on
in
this
way
for
a
long
time
,
when
one
day
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
stopped
short
as
she
and
I
were
walking
,
she
leaning
on
my
*NL*
shoulder
;
and
said
with
some
displeasure
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
growing
tall
,
Pip
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
best
to
hint
,
through
the
medium
of
a
meditative
look
,
that
*NL*
this
might
be
occasioned
by
circumstances
over
which
I
had
no
control
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
no
more
at
the
time
;
but
she
presently
stopped
and
looked
at
me
*NL*
again
;
and
presently
again
;
and
after
that
,
looked
frowning
and
moody
.
*NL*
On
the
next
day
of
my
attendance
,
when
our
usual
exercise
was
over
,
and
*NL*
I
had
landed
her
at
her
dressing-table
,
she
stayed
me
with
a
movement
of
*NL*
her
impatient
fingers
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
the
name
again
of
that
blacksmith
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joe
Gargery
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meaning
the
master
you
were
to
be
apprenticed
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
be
apprenticed
at
once
.
Would
Gargery
come
here
with
*NL*
you
,
and
bring
your
indentures
,
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
signified
that
I
had
no
doubt
he
would
take
it
as
an
honor
to
be
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
him
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
particular
time
,
Miss
Havisham
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
!
I
know
nothing
about
times
.
Let
him
come
soon
,
and
come
*NL*
along
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
home
at
night
,
and
delivered
this
message
for
Joe
,
my
sister
*NL*
``
went
on
the
Rampage
,
''
in
a
more
alarming
degree
than
at
any
previous
*NL*
period
.
She
asked
me
and
Joe
whether
we
supposed
she
was
door-mats
under
*NL*
our
feet
,
and
how
we
dared
to
use
her
so
,
and
what
company
we
graciously
*NL*
thought
she
was
fit
for
?
When
she
had
exhausted
a
torrent
of
such
*NL*
inquiries
,
she
threw
a
candlestick
at
Joe
,
burst
into
a
loud
sobbing
,
*NL*
got
out
the
dustpan
,
--
which
was
always
a
very
bad
sign
,
--
put
on
her
*NL*
coarse
apron
,
and
began
cleaning
up
to
a
terrible
extent
.
Not
satisfied
*NL*
with
a
dry
cleaning
,
she
took
to
a
pail
and
scrubbing-brush
,
and
cleaned
*NL*
us
out
of
house
and
home
,
so
that
we
stood
shivering
in
the
back-yard
.
*NL*
It
was
ten
o'clock
at
night
before
we
ventured
to
creep
in
again
,
and
*NL*
then
she
asked
Joe
why
he
had
n't
married
a
Negress
Slave
at
once
?
*NL*
Joe
offered
no
answer
,
poor
fellow
,
but
stood
feeling
his
whisker
and
*NL*
looking
dejectedly
at
me
,
as
if
he
thought
it
really
might
have
been
a
*NL*
better
speculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
trial
to
my
feelings
,
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
to
see
*NL*
Joe
arraying
himself
in
his
Sunday
clothes
to
accompany
me
to
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
's
.
However
,
as
he
thought
his
court-suit
necessary
to
the
*NL*
occasion
,
it
was
not
for
me
to
tell
him
that
he
looked
far
better
in
his
*NL*
working-dress
;
the
rather
,
because
I
knew
he
made
himself
so
dreadfully
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
entirely
on
my
account
,
and
that
it
was
for
me
he
pulled
*NL*
up
his
shirt-collar
so
very
high
behind
,
that
it
made
the
hair
on
the
*NL*
crown
of
his
head
stand
up
like
a
tuft
of
feathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast-time
my
sister
declared
her
intention
of
going
to
town
with
*NL*
us
,
and
being
left
at
Uncle
Pumblechook
's
and
called
for
``
when
we
had
*NL*
done
with
our
fine
ladies
''
--
a
way
of
putting
the
case
,
from
which
Joe
*NL*
appeared
inclined
to
augur
the
worst
.
The
forge
was
shut
up
for
the
day
,
*NL*
and
Joe
inscribed
in
chalk
upon
the
door
-LRB-
as
it
was
his
custom
to
do
on
*NL*
the
very
rare
occasions
when
he
was
not
at
work
-RRB-
the
monosyllable
*NL*
HOUT
,
accompanied
by
a
sketch
of
an
arrow
supposed
to
be
flying
in
the
*NL*
direction
he
had
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
to
town
,
my
sister
leading
the
way
in
a
very
large
beaver
*NL*
bonnet
,
and
carrying
a
basket
like
the
Great
Seal
of
England
in
plaited
*NL*
Straw
,
a
pair
of
pattens
,
a
spare
shawl
,
and
an
umbrella
,
though
it
*NL*
was
a
fine
bright
day
.
I
am
not
quite
clear
whether
these
articles
were
*NL*
carried
penitentially
or
ostentatiously
;
but
I
rather
think
they
were
*NL*
displayed
as
articles
of
property
,
--
much
as
Cleopatra
or
any
other
*NL*
sovereign
lady
on
the
Rampage
might
exhibit
her
wealth
in
a
pageant
or
*NL*
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
to
Pumblechook
's
,
my
sister
bounced
in
and
left
us
.
As
it
*NL*
was
almost
noon
,
Joe
and
I
held
straight
on
to
Miss
Havisham
's
house
.
*NL*
Estella
opened
the
gate
as
usual
,
and
,
the
moment
she
appeared
,
Joe
took
*NL*
his
hat
off
and
stood
weighing
it
by
the
brim
in
both
his
hands
;
as
if
*NL*
he
had
some
urgent
reason
in
his
mind
for
being
particular
to
half
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
ounce
.
*NL*
*NL*
Estella
took
no
notice
of
either
of
us
,
but
led
us
the
way
that
I
knew
*NL*
so
well
.
I
followed
next
to
her
,
and
Joe
came
last
.
When
I
looked
back
*NL*
at
Joe
in
the
long
passage
,
he
was
still
weighing
his
hat
with
the
*NL*
greatest
care
,
and
was
coming
after
us
in
long
strides
on
the
tips
of
*NL*
his
toes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Estella
told
me
we
were
both
to
go
in
,
so
I
took
Joe
by
the
coat-cuff
*NL*
and
conducted
him
into
Miss
Havisham
's
presence
.
She
was
seated
at
her
*NL*
dressing-table
,
and
looked
round
at
us
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
she
to
Joe
.
``
You
are
the
husband
of
the
sister
of
this
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hardly
have
imagined
dear
old
Joe
looking
so
unlike
himself
or
*NL*
so
like
some
extraordinary
bird
;
standing
as
he
did
speechless
,
with
his
*NL*
tuft
of
feathers
ruffled
,
and
his
mouth
open
as
if
he
wanted
a
worm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
husband
,
''
repeated
Miss
Havisham
,
``
of
the
sister
of
this
*NL*
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
aggravating
;
but
,
throughout
the
interview
,
Joe
persisted
in
*NL*
addressing
Me
instead
of
Miss
Havisham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
I
meantersay
,
Pip
,
''
Joe
now
observed
in
a
manner
that
was
at
*NL*
once
expressive
of
forcible
argumentation
,
strict
confidence
,
and
great
*NL*
politeness
,
``
as
I
hup
and
married
your
sister
,
and
I
were
at
the
time
*NL*
what
you
might
call
-LRB-
if
you
was
anyways
inclined
-RRB-
a
single
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Miss
Havisham
.
``
And
you
have
reared
the
boy
,
with
the
*NL*
intention
of
taking
him
for
your
apprentice
;
is
that
so
,
Mr.
Gargery
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Pip
,
''
replied
Joe
,
``
as
you
and
me
were
ever
friends
,
and
it
*NL*
were
looked
for
`
ard
to
betwixt
us
,
as
being
calc
`
lated
to
lead
to
*NL*
larks
.
Not
but
what
,
Pip
,
if
you
had
ever
made
objections
to
the
*NL*
business
,
--
such
as
its
being
open
to
black
and
sut
,
or
such-like
,
--
not
*NL*
but
what
they
would
have
been
attended
to
,
do
n't
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
the
boy
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
``
ever
made
any
objection
?
Does
he
*NL*
like
the
trade
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
it
is
well
beknown
to
yourself
,
Pip
,
''
returned
Joe
,
strengthening
*NL*
his
former
mixture
of
argumentation
,
confidence
,
and
politeness
,
``
that
*NL*
it
were
the
wish
of
your
own
hart
.
''
-LRB-
I
saw
the
idea
suddenly
break
upon
*NL*
him
that
he
would
adapt
his
epitaph
to
the
occasion
,
before
he
went
on
*NL*
to
say
-RRB-
``
And
there
were
n't
no
objection
on
your
part
,
and
Pip
it
were
*NL*
the
great
wish
of
your
hart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
in
vain
for
me
to
endeavor
to
make
him
sensible
that
he
*NL*
ought
to
speak
to
Miss
Havisham
.
The
more
I
made
faces
and
gestures
*NL*
to
him
to
do
it
,
the
more
confidential
,
argumentative
,
and
polite
,
he
*NL*
persisted
in
being
to
Me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
brought
his
indentures
with
you
?
''
asked
Miss
Havisham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Pip
,
you
know
,
''
replied
Joe
,
as
if
that
were
a
little
*NL*
unreasonable
,
``
you
yourself
see
me
put
'em
in
my
`
at
,
and
therefore
you
*NL*
know
as
they
are
here
.
''
With
which
he
took
them
out
,
and
gave
them
,
not
*NL*
to
Miss
Havisham
,
but
to
me
.
I
am
afraid
I
was
ashamed
of
the
dear
good
*NL*
fellow
,
--
I
know
I
was
ashamed
of
him
,
--
when
I
saw
that
Estella
stood
*NL*
at
the
back
of
Miss
Havisham
's
chair
,
and
that
her
eyes
laughed
*NL*
mischievously
.
I
took
the
indentures
out
of
his
hand
and
gave
them
to
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
expected
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
as
she
looked
them
over
,
``
no
premium
*NL*
with
the
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joe
!
''
I
remonstrated
,
for
he
made
no
reply
at
all
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
*NL*
answer
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
''
returned
Joe
,
cutting
me
short
as
if
he
were
hurt
,
``
which
I
*NL*
meantersay
that
were
not
a
question
requiring
a
answer
betwixt
yourself
*NL*
and
me

which
you
know
the
answer
to
be
full
well
No
.
You
know
it
to
*NL*
be
No

Pip
,
and
wherefore
should
I
say
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
glanced
at
him
as
if
she
understood
what
he
really
was
*NL*
better
than
I
had
thought
possible
,
seeing
what
he
was
there
;
and
took
*NL*
up
a
little
bag
from
the
table
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
has
earned
a
premium
here
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
here
it
is
.
There
are
*NL*
five-and-twenty
guineas
in
this
bag
.
Give
it
to
your
master
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
he
were
absolutely
out
of
his
mind
with
the
wonder
awakened
in
*NL*
him
by
her
strange
figure
and
the
strange
room
,
Joe
,
even
at
this
pass
,
*NL*
persisted
in
addressing
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
wery
liberal
on
your
part
,
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
and
it
is
as
such
*NL*
received
and
grateful
welcome
,
though
never
looked
for
,
far
nor
near
,
*NL*
nor
nowheres
.
And
now
,
old
chap
,
''
said
Joe
,
conveying
to
me
a
sensation
,
*NL*
first
of
burning
and
then
of
freezing
,
for
I
felt
as
if
that
familiar
*NL*
expression
were
applied
to
Miss
Havisham
,
--
``
and
now
,
old
chap
,
may
we
*NL*
do
our
duty
!
May
you
and
me
do
our
duty
,
both
on
us
,
by
one
and
another
,
*NL*
and
by
them
which
your
liberal
present
--
have-conweyed
--
to
be
--
for
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
mind-of
--
them
as
never
--
''
here
Joe
showed
that
he
felt
*NL*
he
had
fallen
into
frightful
difficulties
,
until
he
triumphantly
rescued
*NL*
himself
with
the
words
,
``
and
from
myself
far
be
it
!
''
These
words
had
*NL*
such
a
round
and
convincing
sound
for
him
that
he
said
them
twice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Pip
!
''
said
Miss
Havisham
.
``
Let
them
out
,
Estella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
come
again
,
Miss
Havisham
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Gargery
is
your
master
now
.
Gargery
!
One
word
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
calling
him
back
as
I
went
out
of
the
door
,
I
heard
her
say
to
Joe
*NL*
in
a
distinct
emphatic
voice
,
``
The
boy
has
been
a
good
boy
here
,
and
*NL*
that
is
his
reward
.
Of
course
,
as
an
honest
man
,
you
will
expect
no
*NL*
other
and
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
Joe
got
out
of
the
room
,
I
have
never
been
able
to
determine
;
but
*NL*
I
know
that
when
he
did
get
out
he
was
steadily
proceeding
upstairs
*NL*
instead
of
coming
down
,
and
was
deaf
to
all
remonstrances
until
I
went
*NL*
after
him
and
laid
hold
of
him
.
In
another
minute
we
were
outside
the
*NL*
gate
,
and
it
was
locked
,
and
Estella
was
gone
.
When
we
stood
in
the
*NL*
daylight
alone
again
,
Joe
backed
up
against
a
wall
,
and
said
to
me
,
*NL*
``
Astonishing
!
''
And
there
he
remained
so
long
saying
,
``
Astonishing
''
at
*NL*
intervals
,
so
often
,
that
I
began
to
think
his
senses
were
never
coming
*NL*
back
.
At
length
he
prolonged
his
remark
into
``
Pip
,
I
do
assure
you
this
*NL*
is
as-TON-ishing
!
''
and
so
,
by
degrees
,
became
conversational
and
able
to
*NL*
walk
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
reason
to
think
that
Joe
's
intellects
were
brightened
by
the
*NL*
encounter
they
had
passed
through
,
and
that
on
our
way
to
Pumblechook
's
*NL*
he
invented
a
subtle
and
deep
design
.
My
reason
is
to
be
found
in
*NL*
what
took
place
in
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
parlor
:
where
,
on
our
presenting
*NL*
ourselves
,
my
sister
sat
in
conference
with
that
detested
seedsman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
cried
my
sister
,
addressing
us
both
at
once
.
``
And
what
's
*NL*
happened
to
you
?
I
wonder
you
condescend
to
come
back
to
such
poor
*NL*
society
as
this
,
I
am
sure
I
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Havisham
,
''
said
Joe
,
with
a
fixed
look
at
me
,
like
an
effort
of
*NL*
remembrance
,
``
made
it
wery
partick
`
ler
that
we
should
give
her
--
were
it
*NL*
compliments
or
respects

Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Compliments
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
that
were
my
own
belief
,
''
answered
Joe
;
``
her
compliments
to
Mrs.
*NL*
J.
Gargery
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
good
they
'll
do

observed
my
sister
;
but
rather
gratified
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wishing
,
''
pursued
Joe
,
with
another
fixed
look
at
me
,
like
another
*NL*
effort
of
remembrance
,
``
that
the
state
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

the
pleasure

''
I
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

said
Joe
.
And
drew
a
long
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
cried
my
sister
,
with
a
mollified
glance
at
Mr.
Pumblechook
.
*NL*
``
She
might
have
had
the
politeness
to
send
that
message
at
first
,
but
*NL*
it
's
better

never

And
what
did
she
give
young
Rantipole
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
giv

him

said
Joe
,
``
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Joe
was
going
to
break
out
,
but
Joe
went
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

said
Joe
,
``

her
words

She
may

added
Joe
,
with
an
appearance
of
reflection
,
``
whether
it
*NL*
were
Joe
,
or
Jorge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
looked
at
Pumblechook
:
who
smoothed
the
elbows
of
his
wooden
*NL*
arm-chair
,
and
nodded
at
her
and
at
the
fire
,
as
if
he
had
known
all
*NL*
about
it
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
have
you
got
?
''
asked
my
sister
,
laughing
.
Positively
*NL*
laughing
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
present
company
say
to
ten
pound
?
''
demanded
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'd
say
,
''
returned
my
sister
,
curtly
,
``
pretty
well

Not
too
much
,
*NL*
but
pretty
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
more
than
that
,
then
,
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
fearful
Impostor
,
Pumblechook
,
immediately
nodded
,
and
said
,
as
he
*NL*
rubbed
the
arms
of
his
chair
,
``
It
's
more
than
that
,
Mum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
--
''
began
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
I
do
,
Mum
,
''
said
Pumblechook
;
``
but
wait
a
bit
.
Go
on
,
Joseph
.
Good
*NL*
in
you
!
Go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
present
company
say
,
''
proceeded
Joe
,
``
to
twenty
pound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
would
be
the
word

returned
my
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
It
's
more
than
twenty

*NL*
*NL*
That
abject
hypocrite
,
Pumblechook
,
nodded
again
,
and
said
,
with
a
*NL*
patronizing
laugh
,
``
It
's
more
than
that
,
Mum
.
Good
again
!
Follow
her
up
,
*NL*
Joseph
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
to
make
an
end
of
it
,
''
said
Joe
,
delightedly
handing
the
bag
to
my
*NL*
sister
;
``
it
's
five-and-twenty
pound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
five-and-twenty
pound
,
Mum
,
''
echoed
that
basest
of
swindlers
,
*NL*
Pumblechook
,
rising
to
shake
hands
with
her
;
``
and
it
's
no
more
than
your
*NL*
merits
-LRB-
as
I
said
when
my
opinion
was
asked

,
and
I
wish
you
joy
of
the
*NL*
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
villain
had
stopped
here
,
his
case
would
have
been
sufficiently
*NL*
awful
,
but
he
blackened
his
guilt
by
proceeding
to
take
me
into
custody
,
*NL*
with
a
right
of
patronage
that
left
all
his
former
criminality
far
*NL*
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
see
,
Joseph
and
wife

said
Pumblechook
,
as
he
took
me
by
the
*NL*
arm
above
the
elbow
,
``
I
am
one
of
them
that
always
go
right
through
with

what

've
begun

be
bound

out

's
my

*NL*
Bound
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
knows

Uncle

said
my
sister
-LRB-
grasping
the
*NL*
money
-RRB-
,
``
we
're
deeply
beholden
to
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
me
,
Mum
,
''
returned
that
diabolical
cornchandler
.
``
A
*NL*
pleasure
's
a
pleasure
all
the
world
over
.
But
this
boy
,
you
know
;
we
*NL*
must
have
him
bound

I
said
I
'd
see
to
it
--
to
tell
you
the
truth

*NL*
*NL*
The
Justices
were
sitting
in
the
Town
Hall
near
at
hand
,
and
we
at
*NL*
once
went
over
to
have
me
bound
apprentice
to
Joe
in
the
Magisterial
*NL*
presence
.
I
say
we
went
over
,
but
I
was
pushed
over
by
Pumblechook
,
*NL*
exactly
as
if
I
had
that
moment
picked
a
pocket
or
fired
a
rick
;
indeed
,
*NL*
it
was
the
general
impression
in
Court
that
I
had
been
taken
red-handed
;
*NL*
for
,
as
Pumblechook
shoved
me
before
him
through
the
crowd
,
I
heard
some
*NL*
people
say
,
``
What
's
he
done
?
''
and
others
,
``
He
's
a
young
`
un
,
too
,
but
*NL*
looks
bad
,
do
n't
he
?
''
One
person
of
mild
and
benevolent
aspect
even
gave
*NL*
me
a
tract
ornamented
with
a
woodcut
of
a
malevolent
young
man
fitted
*NL*
up
with
a
perfect
sausage-shop
of
fetters
,
and
entitled
TO
BE
READ
IN
MY
*NL*
CELL
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hall
was
a
queer
place
,
I
thought
,
with
higher
pews
in
it
than
a
*NL*
church
,
--
and
with
people
hanging
over
the
pews
looking
on
,
--
and
with
*NL*
mighty
Justices
-LRB-
one
with
a
powdered
head
-RRB-
leaning
back
in
chairs
,
with
*NL*
folded
arms
,
or
taking
snuff
,
or
going
to
sleep
,
or
writing
,
or
reading
*NL*
the
newspapers
,
--
and
with
some
shining
black
portraits
on
the
walls
,
*NL*
which
my
unartistic
eye
regarded
as
a
composition
of
hardbake
and
*NL*
sticking-plaster
.
Here
,
in
a
corner
my
indentures
were
duly
signed
and
*NL*
attested
,
and
I
was
``
bound
''
;
Mr.
Pumblechook
holding
me
all
the
while
*NL*
as
if
we
had
looked
in
on
our
way
to
the
scaffold
,
to
have
those
little
*NL*
preliminaries
disposed
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
come
out
again
,
and
had
got
rid
of
the
boys
who
had
been
put
*NL*
into
great
spirits
by
the
expectation
of
seeing
me
publicly
tortured
,
*NL*
and
who
were
much
disappointed
to
find
that
my
friends
were
merely
*NL*
rallying
round
me
,
we
went
back
to
Pumblechook
's
.
And
there
my
sister
*NL*
became
so
excited
by
the
twenty-five
guineas
,
that
nothing
would
serve
*NL*
her
but
we
must
have
a
dinner
out
of
that
windfall
at
the
Blue
Boar
,
and
*NL*
that
Pumblechook
must
go
over
in
his
chaise-cart
,
and
bring
the
Hubbles
*NL*
and
Mr.
Wopsle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
agreed
to
be
done
;
and
a
most
melancholy
day
I
passed
.
For
,
*NL*
it
inscrutably
appeared
to
stand
to
reason
,
in
the
minds
of
the
whole
*NL*
company
,
that
I
was
an
excrescence
on
the
entertainment
.
And
to
make
it
*NL*
worse
,
they
all
asked
me
from
time
to
time
,
--
in
short
,
whenever
they
*NL*
had
nothing
else
to
do
,
--
why
I
did
n't
enjoy
myself
?
And
what
could
I
*NL*
possibly
do
then
,
but
say
I
was
enjoying
myself
,
--
when
I
was
n't
!
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
they
were
grown
up
and
had
their
own
way
,
and
they
made
the
*NL*
most
of
it
.
That
swindling
Pumblechook
,
exalted
into
the
beneficent
*NL*
contriver
of
the
whole
occasion
,
actually
took
the
top
of
the
table
;
*NL*
and
,
when
he
addressed
them
on
the
subject
of
my
being
bound
,
and
had
*NL*
fiendishly
congratulated
them
on
my
being
liable
to
imprisonment
if
I
*NL*
played
at
cards
,
drank
strong
liquors
,
kept
late
hours
or
bad
company
,
*NL*
or
indulged
in
other
vagaries
which
the
form
of
my
indentures
appeared
*NL*
to
contemplate
as
next
to
inevitable
,
he
placed
me
standing
on
a
chair
*NL*
beside
him
to
illustrate
his
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
only
other
remembrances
of
the
great
festival
are
,
That
they
would
n't
*NL*
let
me
go
to
sleep
,
but
whenever
they
saw
me
dropping
off
,
woke
me
up
*NL*
and
told
me
to
enjoy
myself
.
That
,
rather
late
in
the
evening
Mr.
Wopsle
*NL*
gave
us
Collins
's
ode
,
and
threw
his
bloodstained
sword
in
thunder
*NL*
down
,
with
such
effect
,
that
a
waiter
came
in
and
said
,
``
The
Commercials
*NL*
underneath
sent
up
their
compliments
,
and
it
was
n't
the
Tumblers
'
Arms
.
''
*NL*
That
,
they
were
all
in
excellent
spirits
on
the
road
home
,
and
sang
,
O
*NL*
Lady
Fair
!
Mr.
Wopsle
taking
the
bass
,
and
asserting
with
a
tremendously
*NL*
strong
voice
-LRB-
in
reply
to
the
inquisitive
bore
who
leads
that
piece
*NL*
of
music
in
a
most
impertinent
manner
,
by
wanting
to
know
all
about
*NL*
everybody
's
private
affairs
-RRB-
that
he
was
the
man
with
his
white
locks
*NL*
flowing
,
and
that
he
was
upon
the
whole
the
weakest
pilgrim
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
I
remember
that
when
I
got
into
my
little
bedroom
,
I
was
truly
*NL*
wretched
,
and
had
a
strong
conviction
on
me
that
I
should
never
like
*NL*
Joe
's
trade
.
I
had
liked
it
once
,
but
once
was
not
now
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
most
miserable
thing
to
feel
ashamed
of
home
.
There
may
be
black
*NL*
ingratitude
in
the
thing
,
and
the
punishment
may
be
retributive
and
well
*NL*
deserved
;
but
that
it
is
a
miserable
thing
,
I
can
testify
.
*NL*
*NL*
Home
had
never
been
a
very
pleasant
place
to
me
,
because
of
my
sister
's
*NL*
temper
.
But
,
Joe
had
sanctified
it
,
and
I
had
believed
in
it
.
I
had
*NL*
believed
in
the
best
parlor
as
a
most
elegant
saloon
;
I
had
believed
*NL*
in
the
front
door
,
as
a
mysterious
portal
of
the
Temple
of
State
whose
*NL*
solemn
opening
was
attended
with
a
sacrifice
of
roast
fowls
;
I
had
*NL*
believed
in
the
kitchen
as
a
chaste
though
not
magnificent
apartment
;
*NL*
I
had
believed
in
the
forge
as
the
glowing
road
to
manhood
and
*NL*
independence
.
Within
a
single
year
all
this
was
changed
.
Now
it
was
all
*NL*
coarse
and
common
,
and
I
would
not
have
had
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
*NL*
see
it
on
any
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
much
of
my
ungracious
condition
of
mind
may
have
been
my
own
fault
,
*NL*
how
much
Miss
Havisham
's
,
how
much
my
sister
's
,
is
now
of
no
moment
to
*NL*
me
or
to
any
one
.
The
change
was
made
in
me
;
the
thing
was
done
.
Well
or
*NL*
ill
done
,
excusably
or
inexcusably
,
it
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
when
I
should
at
last
roll
up
my
*NL*
shirt-sleeves
and
go
into
the
forge
,
Joe
's
`
prentice
,
I
should
be
*NL*
distinguished
and
happy
.
Now
the
reality
was
in
my
hold
,
I
only
felt
*NL*
that
I
was
dusty
with
the
dust
of
small-coal
,
and
that
I
had
a
weight
*NL*
upon
my
daily
remembrance
to
which
the
anvil
was
a
feather
.
There
have
*NL*
been
occasions
in
my
later
life
-LRB-
I
suppose
as
in
most
lives
-RRB-
when
I
have
*NL*
felt
for
a
time
as
if
a
thick
curtain
had
fallen
on
all
its
interest
*NL*
and
romance
,
to
shut
me
out
from
anything
save
dull
endurance
any
more
.
*NL*
Never
has
that
curtain
dropped
so
heavy
and
blank
,
as
when
my
way
in
*NL*
life
lay
stretched
out
straight
before
me
through
the
newly
entered
road
*NL*
of
apprenticeship
to
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
that
at
a
later
period
of
my
``
time
,
''
I
used
to
stand
about
*NL*
the
churchyard
on
Sunday
evenings
when
night
was
falling
,
comparing
my
*NL*
own
perspective
with
the
windy
marsh
view
,
and
making
out
some
likeness
*NL*
between
them
by
thinking
how
flat
and
low
both
were
,
and
how
on
both
*NL*
there
came
an
unknown
way
and
a
dark
mist
and
then
the
sea
.
I
was
quite
*NL*
as
dejected
on
the
first
working-day
of
my
apprenticeship
as
in
that
*NL*
after-time
;
but
I
am
glad
to
know
that
I
never
breathed
a
murmur
to
Joe
*NL*
while
my
indentures
lasted
.
It
is
about
the
only
thing
I
am
glad
to
know
*NL*
of
myself
in
that
connection
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
though
it
includes
what
I
proceed
to
add
,
all
the
merit
of
what
I
*NL*
proceed
to
add
was
Joe
's
.
It
was
not
because
I
was
faithful
,
but
because
*NL*
Joe
was
faithful
,
that
I
never
ran
away
and
went
for
a
soldier
or
*NL*
a
sailor
.
It
was
not
because
I
had
a
strong
sense
of
the
virtue
of
*NL*
industry
,
but
because
Joe
had
a
strong
sense
of
the
virtue
of
industry
,
*NL*
that
I
worked
with
tolerable
zeal
against
the
grain
.
It
is
not
possible
*NL*
to
know
how
far
the
influence
of
any
amiable
honest-hearted
duty-doing
*NL*
man
flies
out
into
the
world
;
but
it
is
very
possible
to
know
how
it
has
*NL*
touched
one
's
self
in
going
by
,
and
I
know
right
well
that
any
good
that
*NL*
intermixed
itself
with
my
apprenticeship
came
of
plain
contented
Joe
,
*NL*
and
not
of
restlessly
aspiring
discontented
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
wanted
,
who
can
say
?
How
can
I
say
,
when
I
never
knew
?
What
*NL*
I
dreaded
was
,
that
in
some
unlucky
hour
I
,
being
at
my
grimiest
and
*NL*
commonest
,
should
lift
up
my
eyes
and
see
Estella
looking
in
at
one
*NL*
of
the
wooden
windows
of
the
forge
.
I
was
haunted
by
the
fear
that
she
*NL*
would
,
sooner
or
later
,
find
me
out
,
with
a
black
face
and
hands
,
doing
*NL*
the
coarsest
part
of
my
work
,
and
would
exult
over
me
and
despise
me
.
*NL*
Often
after
dark
,
when
I
was
pulling
the
bellows
for
Joe
,
and
we
were
*NL*
singing
Old
Clem
,
and
when
the
thought
how
we
used
to
sing
it
at
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
's
would
seem
to
show
me
Estella
's
face
in
the
fire
,
with
her
*NL*
pretty
hair
fluttering
in
the
wind
and
her
eyes
scorning
me
,
--
often
at
*NL*
such
a
time
I
would
look
towards
those
panels
of
black
night
in
the
wall
*NL*
which
the
wooden
windows
then
were
,
and
would
fancy
that
I
saw
her
just
*NL*
drawing
her
face
away
,
and
would
believe
that
she
had
come
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
when
we
went
in
to
supper
,
the
place
and
the
meal
would
have
*NL*
a
more
homely
look
than
ever
,
and
I
would
feel
more
ashamed
of
home
than
*NL*
ever
,
in
my
own
ungracious
breast
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
getting
too
big
for
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
's
room
,
my
*NL*
education
under
that
preposterous
female
terminated
.
Not
,
however
,
until
*NL*
Biddy
had
imparted
to
me
everything
she
knew
,
from
the
little
catalogue
*NL*
of
prices
,
to
a
comic
song
she
had
once
bought
for
a
half-penny
.
*NL*
Although
the
only
coherent
part
of
the
latter
piece
of
literature
were
*NL*
the
opening
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
went
to
Lunnon
town
sirs
,
*NL*
Too
rul

*NL*
Too

*NL*
Was
n't
I
done
very
brown
sirs
?
*NL*
Too

*NL*
Too
rul
loo
rul
*NL*
*NL*
--
still
,
in
my
desire
to
be
wiser
,
I
got
this
composition
by
heart
with
the
utmost
gravity
;
nor
do
I
recollect
that
I
questioned
its
merit
,
except
that
I
*NL*
thought
-LRB-
as
I
still
do
-RRB-
the
amount
of
Too
rul
somewhat
in
excess
of
the
*NL*
poetry
.
In
my
hunger
for
information
,
I
made
proposals
to
Mr.
Wopsle
to
*NL*
bestow
some
intellectual
crumbs
upon
me
,
with
which
he
kindly
complied
.
*NL*
As
it
turned
out
,
however
,
that
he
only
wanted
me
for
a
dramatic
*NL*
lay-figure
,
to
be
contradicted
and
embraced
and
wept
over
and
bullied
*NL*
and
clutched
and
stabbed
and
knocked
about
in
a
variety
of
ways
,
I
soon
*NL*
declined
that
course
of
instruction
;
though
not
until
Mr.
Wopsle
in
his
*NL*
poetic
fury
had
severely
mauled
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
I
acquired
,
I
tried
to
impart
to
Joe
.
This
statement
sounds
so
*NL*
well
,
that
I
can
not
in
my
conscience
let
it
pass
unexplained
.
I
wanted
*NL*
to
make
Joe
less
ignorant
and
common
,
that
he
might
be
worthier
of
my
*NL*
society
and
less
open
to
Estella
's
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
Battery
out
on
the
marshes
was
our
place
of
study
,
and
a
broken
*NL*
slate
and
a
short
piece
of
slate-pencil
were
our
educational
implements
:
*NL*
to
which
Joe
always
added
a
pipe
of
tobacco
.
I
never
knew
Joe
to
*NL*
remember
anything
from
one
Sunday
to
another
,
or
to
acquire
,
under
my
*NL*
tuition
,
any
piece
of
information
whatever
.
Yet
he
would
smoke
his
pipe
*NL*
at
the
Battery
with
a
far
more
sagacious
air
than
anywhere
else
,
--
even
*NL*
with
a
learned
air
,
--
as
if
he
considered
himself
to
be
advancing
*NL*
immensely
.
Dear
fellow
,
I
hope
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
pleasant
and
quiet
,
out
there
with
the
sails
on
the
river
passing
*NL*
beyond
the
earthwork
,
and
sometimes
,
when
the
tide
was
low
,
looking
*NL*
as
if
they
belonged
to
sunken
ships
that
were
still
sailing
on
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
water
.
Whenever
I
watched
the
vessels
standing
out
to
sea
*NL*
with
their
white
sails
spread
,
I
somehow
thought
of
Miss
Havisham
and
*NL*
Estella
;
and
whenever
the
light
struck
aslant
,
afar
off
,
upon
a
cloud
*NL*
or
sail
or
green
hillside
or
water-line
,
it
was
just
the
same
.
--
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
and
Estella
and
the
strange
house
and
the
strange
life
appeared
*NL*
to
have
something
to
do
with
everything
that
was
picturesque
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Sunday
when
Joe
,
greatly
enjoying
his
pipe
,
had
so
plumed
himself
on
*NL*
being
``
most
awful
dull
,
''
that
I
had
given
him
up
for
the
day
,
I
lay
on
*NL*
the
earthwork
for
some
time
with
my
chin
on
my
hand
,
descrying
traces
of
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
all
over
the
prospect
,
in
the
sky
and
in
the
*NL*
water
,
until
at
last
I
resolved
to
mention
a
thought
concerning
them
*NL*
that
had
been
much
in
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joe
,
''
said
I
;
``
do
n't
you
think
I
ought
to
make
Miss
Havisham
a
visit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Pip
,
''
returned
Joe
,
slowly
considering
.
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
,
Joe
?
What
is
any
visit
made
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
some
wisits
p
`
r
`
aps
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
as
for
ever
remains
open
to
*NL*
the
question
,
Pip
.
But
in
regard
to
wisiting
Miss
Havisham
.
She
might
*NL*
think
you
wanted
something
,
--
expected
something
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
I
might
say
that
I
did
not
,
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
,
old
chap
,
''
said
Joe
.
``
And
she
might
credit
it
.
Similarly
she
*NL*
might
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
felt
,
as
I
did
,
that
he
had
made
a
point
there
,
and
he
pulled
hard
*NL*
at
his
pipe
to
keep
himself
from
weakening
it
by
repetition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Pip
,
''
Joe
pursued
,
as
soon
as
he
was
past
that
danger
,
``
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
done
the
handsome
thing
by
you
.
When
Miss
Havisham
done
the
*NL*
handsome
thing
by
you
,
she
called
me
back
to
say
to
me
as
that
were
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Joe
.
I
heard
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
ALL
,
''
Joe
repeated
,
very
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Joe
.
I
tell
you
,
I
heard
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
I
meantersay
,
Pip
,
it
might
be
that
her
meaning
were

As

North

and
you

Keep

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
thought
of
that
too
,
and
it
was
very
far
from
comforting
to
me
*NL*
to
find
that
he
had
thought
of
it
;
for
it
seemed
to
render
it
more
*NL*
probable

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
But
Joe
had
got
the
idea

in
his
head

must
harp
upon
it
.
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

Joe

I
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Joe
,
still
harping
on
it
as
though
I
had
particularly
*NL*
pressed
it
,
``

said
*NL*
Joe
,
steadfastly
impressing
it
upon
me
,
as
if
he
were
endeavouring
to
*NL*
rouse
me
from
a
fixed
delusion
,
``
and
you
may
haim
at
what
you
like
,
but
*NL*
a
gridiron
it
will
come
out

either
by
your
leave
or
again
your
leave

*NL*
and
you
ca
n't
help
yourself
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Joe
,
''
I
cried
,
in
desperation
,
taking
hold
of
his
coat
,
``
do
n't
*NL*
go
on
in
that
way
.
I
never
thought
of
making
Miss
Havisham
any
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Pip
,
''
Joe
assented
,
as
if
he
had
been
contending
for
that
,
all
*NL*
along
;
``
and
what
I
say
to
you
is
,
you
are
right
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Joe
;
but
what
I
wanted
to
say
,
was
,
that
as
we
are
rather
slack
*NL*
just
now
,
if
you
would
give
me
a
half-holiday
to-morrow
,
I
think
I
would
*NL*
go
uptown
and
make
a
call
on
Miss
Est
--
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
her
name
,
''
said
Joe
,
gravely
,
``
ai
n't
Estavisham
,
Pip
,
unless
she
*NL*
have
been
rechris
`
ened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
Joe
,
I
know
.
It
was
a
slip
of
mine
.
What
do
you
think
of
it
,
*NL*
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
brief
,
Joe
thought
that
if
I
thought
well
of
it
,
he
thought
well
of
*NL*
it
.
But
,
he
was
particular
in
stipulating
that
if
I
were
not
received
*NL*
with
cordiality
,
or
if
I
were
not
encouraged
to
repeat
my
visit
as
a
*NL*
visit
which
had
no
ulterior
object
but
was
simply
one
of
gratitude
for
a
*NL*
favor
received
,
then
this
experimental
trip
should
have
no
successor
.
By
*NL*
these
conditions
I
promised
to
abide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Joe
kept
a
journeyman
at
weekly
wages
whose
name
was
Orlick
.
*NL*
He
pretended
that
his
Christian
name
was
Dolge
,
--
a
clear
*NL*
Impossibility
,
--
but
he
was
a
fellow
of
that
obstinate
disposition
that
I
*NL*
believe
him
to
have
been
the
prey
of
no
delusion
in
this
particular
,
but
*NL*
wilfully
to
have
imposed
that
name
upon
the
village
as
an
affront
to
its
*NL*
understanding
.
He
was
a
broadshouldered
loose-limbed
swarthy
fellow
of
*NL*
great
strength
,
never
in
a
hurry
,
and
always
slouching
.
He
never
even
*NL*
seemed
to
come
to
his
work
on
purpose
,
but
would
slouch
in
as
if
by
mere
*NL*
accident
;
and
when
he
went
to
the
Jolly
Bargemen
to
eat
his
dinner
,
or
*NL*
went
away
at
night
,
he
would
slouch
out
,
like
Cain
or
the
Wandering
Jew
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
no
idea
where
he
was
going
and
no
intention
of
ever
*NL*
coming
back
.
He
lodged
at
a
sluice-keeper
's
out
on
the
marshes
,
and
on
*NL*
working-days
would
come
slouching
from
his
hermitage
,
with
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
and
his
dinner
loosely
tied
in
a
bundle
round
his
neck
*NL*
and
dangling
on
his
back
.
On
Sundays
he
mostly
lay
all
day
on
the
*NL*
sluice-gates
,
or
stood
against
ricks
and
barns
.
He
always
slouched
,
*NL*
locomotively
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
;
and
,
when
accosted
or
*NL*
otherwise
required
to
raise
them
,
he
looked
up
in
a
half-resentful
,
*NL*
half-puzzled
way
,
as
though
the
only
thought
he
ever
had
was
,
that
it
*NL*
was
rather
an
odd
and
injurious
fact
that
he
should
never
be
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
morose
journeyman
had
no
liking
for
me
.
When
I
was
very
small
and
*NL*
timid
,
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
Devil
lived
in
a
black
corner
*NL*
of
the
forge
,
and
that
he
knew
the
fiend
very
well
:
also
that
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
make
up
the
fire
,
once
in
seven
years
,
with
a
live
boy
,
and
*NL*
that
I
might
consider
myself
fuel
.
When
I
became
Joe
's
`
prentice
,
Orlick
*NL*
was
perhaps
confirmed
in
some
suspicion
that
I
should
displace
him
;
*NL*
howbeit
,
he
liked
me
still
less
.
Not
that
he
ever
said
anything
,
or
did
*NL*
anything
,
openly
importing
hostility
;
I
only
noticed
that
he
always
beat
*NL*
his
sparks
in
my
direction
,
and
that
whenever
I
sang
Old
Clem
,
he
came
*NL*
in
out
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolge
Orlick
was
at
work
and
present
,
next
day
,
when
I
reminded
Joe
of
*NL*
my
half-holiday
.
He
said
nothing
at
the
moment
,
for
he
and
Joe
had
just
*NL*
got
a
piece
of
hot
iron
between
them
,
and
I
was
at
the
bellows
;
but
by
*NL*
and
by
he
said
,
leaning
on
his
hammer
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
master
!
Sure
you
're
not
a
going
to
favor
only
one
of
us
.
If
Young
*NL*
Pip
has
a
half-holiday
,
do
as
much
for
Old
Orlick
.
''
I
suppose
he
was
*NL*
about
five-and-twenty
,
but
he
usually
spoke
of
himself
as
an
ancient
*NL*
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
'll
you
do
with
a
half-holiday
,
if
you
get
it
?
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
'll
I
do
with
it
!
What
'll
he
do
with
it
?
I
'll
do
as
much
with
it
as
*NL*
him
,
''
said
Orlick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
Pip
,
he
's
going
up
town
,
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
as
to
Old
Orlick
,
he
's
a
going
up
town
,
''
retorted
that
*NL*
worthy
.
``
Two
can
go
up
town
.
Tai
n't
only
one
wot
can
go
up
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
lose
your
temper
,
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
if
I
like
,
''
growled
Orlick
.
``
Some
and
their
uptowning
!
Now
,
*NL*
master
!
Come

No
favoring
in
this
shop

Be
a
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
refusing
to
entertain
the
subject
until
the
journeyman
was
in
*NL*
a
better
temper
,
Orlick
plunged
at
the
furnace
,
drew
out
a
red-hot
*NL*
bar
,
made
at
me
with
it
as
if
he
were
going
to
run
it
through
my
body
,
*NL*
whisked
it
round
my
head
,
laid
it
on
the
anvil
,
hammered
it
out
,
--
as
*NL*
if
it
were
I
,
I
thought
,
and
the
sparks
were
my
spirting
blood
,
--
and
*NL*
finally
said
,
when
he
had
hammered
himself
hot
and
the
iron
cold
,
and
he
*NL*
again
leaned
on
his
hammer
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
master
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
all
right
now
?
''
demanded
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
am
all
right
,
''
said
gruff
Old
Orlick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
as
in
general
you
stick
to
your
work
as
well
as
most
men
,
''
said
*NL*
Joe
,
``
let
it
be
a
half-holiday
for
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
had
been
standing
silent
in
the
yard
,
within
hearing
,
--
she
was
*NL*
a
most
unscrupulous
spy
and
listener
,
--
and
she
instantly
looked
in
at
*NL*
one
of
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
you
,
you
fool
!
''
said
she
to
Joe
,
``
giving
holidays
to
great
idle
*NL*
hulkers
like
that

You
are
a
rich
man
,
upon
my
life

to
waste
wages
in
*NL*
that
way

I
wish
I

his
master

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
be
everybody
's
master

if
you
durst

retorted
Orlick
,
with
an
*NL*
ill-favored
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Let
her
alone

said
Joe
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
be
a
match
for
all
noodles
and
all
rogues

returned
my
sister
,
*NL*
beginning
to
work
herself
into
a
mighty
rage
.
``
And
I
could
n't
be
a
*NL*
match

the
noodles

without
being
a
match
for
your

who
's
the
*NL*
dunder-headed
king
of
the
noodles
.
And
I
could
n't
be
a
match
for
the
*NL*
rogues
,
without
being
a
match
for
you
,
who
are
the
blackest-looking
and
*NL*
the
worst
rogue
between
this
and
France
.
Now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
foul
shrew
,
Mother
Gargery
,
''
growled
the
journeyman
.
``
If
that
*NL*
makes
a
judge
of
rogues
,
you
ought
to
be
a
good
`

''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Let
her
alone
,
will
you
?
''
said
Joe
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
?
''
cried
my
sister
,
beginning
to
scream
.
``
What
did
you
*NL*
say
?
What
did
that
fellow
Orlick
say
to

What
did
he
call
me
,
*NL*
with
my
husband
standing
by
?
Oh
!
oh
!
oh
!
''
Each
of
these
exclamations
was
*NL*
a
shriek
;
and
I
must
remark
of
my
sister
,
what
is
equally
true
of
all
*NL*
the
violent
women
I
have
ever
seen
,
that
passion
was
no
excuse
for
*NL*
her
,
because
it
is
undeniable
that
instead
of
lapsing
into
passion
,
she
*NL*
consciously
and
deliberately
took
extraordinary
pains
to
force
herself
*NL*
into
it
,
and
became
blindly
furious
by
regular
stages
;
``
what
was
the
*NL*
name
he
gave
me
before
the
base
man
who
swore
to
defend
me
?
Oh
!
Hold
me
!
*NL*
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah-h-h
!
''
growled
the
journeyman
,
between
his
teeth
,
``
I
'd
hold
you
,
if
*NL*
you
was
my
wife
.
I
'd
hold
you
under
the
pump
,
and
choke
it
out
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
I
tell
you
,
let
her
alone
,
''
said
Joe
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
To
hear
him
!
''
cried
my
sister
,
with
a
clap
of
her
hands
and
a
*NL*
scream
together
,
--
which
was
her
next
stage
.
``
To
hear
the
names
he
's
*NL*
giving
me
!
That
Orlick
!
In
my
own
house
!
Me
,
a
married
woman
!
With
my
*NL*
husband
standing
by
!
Oh
!
Oh
!
''
Here
my
sister
,
after
a
fit
of
clappings
*NL*
and
screamings
,
beat
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
and
upon
her
knees
,
and
*NL*
threw
her
cap
off
,
and
pulled
her
hair
down
,
--
which
were
the
last
stages
*NL*
on
her
road
to
frenzy
.
Being
by
this
time
a
perfect
Fury
and
a
complete
*NL*
success
,
she
made
a
dash
at
the
door
which
I
had
fortunately
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
the
wretched
Joe
do
now
,
after
his
disregarded
parenthetical
*NL*
interruptions
,
but
stand
up
to
his
journeyman
,
and
ask
him
what
he
meant
*NL*
by
interfering
betwixt
himself
and
Mrs.
Joe
;
and
further
whether
he
was
*NL*
man
enough
to
come
on
?
Old
Orlick
felt
that
the
situation
admitted
of
*NL*
nothing
less
than
coming
on
,
and
was
on
his
defence
straightway
;
so
,
*NL*
without
so
much
as
pulling
off
their
singed
and
burnt
aprons
,
they
went
*NL*
at
one
another
,
like
two
giants
.
But
,
if
any
man
in
that
neighborhood
*NL*
could
stand
uplong
against
Joe
,
I
never
saw
the
man
.
Orlick
,
as
if
he
*NL*
had
been
of
no
more
account
than
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
was
very
*NL*
soon
among
the
coal-dust
,
and
in
no
hurry
to
come
out
of
it
.
Then
Joe
*NL*
unlocked
the
door
and
picked
up
my
sister
,
who
had
dropped
insensible
*NL*
at
the
window
-LRB-
but
who
had
seen
the
fight
first
,
I
think
-RRB-
,
and
who
was
*NL*
carried
into
the
house
and
laid
down
,
and
who
was
recommended
to
revive
,
*NL*
and
would
do
nothing
but
struggle
and
clench
her
hands
in
Joe
's
hair
.
*NL*
Then
,
came
that
singular
calm
and
silence
which
succeed
all
uproars
;
and
*NL*
then
,
with
the
vague
sensation
which
I
have
always
connected
with
such
*NL*
a
lull
,
--
namely
,
that
it
was
Sunday
,
and
somebody
was
dead
,
--
I
went
upstairs
*NL*
stto
dress
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
down
again
,
I
found
Joe
and
Orlick
sweeping
up
,
without
any
*NL*
other
traces
of
discomposure
than
a
slit
in
one
of
Orlick
's
nostrils
,
*NL*
which
was
neither
expressive
nor
ornamental
.
A
pot
of
beer
had
appeared
*NL*
from
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
and
they
were
sharing
it
by
turns
in
a
*NL*
peaceable
manner
.
The
lull
had
a
sedative
and
philosophical
influence
on
*NL*
Joe
,
who
followed
me
out
into
the
road
to
say
,
as
a
parting
observation
*NL*
that
might
do
me
good
,
``
On
the
Rampage
,
Pip
,
and
off
the
Rampage
,
*NL*
Pip
:
--
such
is
Life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
what
absurd
emotions
-LRB-
for
we
think
the
feelings
that
are
very
*NL*
serious
in
a
man
quite
comical
in
a
boy
-RRB-
I
found
myself
again
going
to
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
's
,
matters
little
here
.
Nor
,
how
I
passed
and
repassed
*NL*
the
gate
many
times
before
I
could
make
up
my
mind
to
ring
.
Nor
,
how
*NL*
I
debated
whether
I
should
go
away
without
ringing
;
nor
,
how
I
should
*NL*
undoubtedly
have
gone
,
if
my
time
had
been
my
own
,
to
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Sarah
Pocket
came
to
the
gate
.
No
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
then
?
You
here
again
?
''
said
Miss
Pocket
.
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
said
that
I
only
came
to
see
how
Miss
Havisham
was
,
Sarah
*NL*
evidently
deliberated
whether
or
no
she
should
send
me
about
my
*NL*
business
.
But
unwilling
to
hazard
the
responsibility
,
she
let
me
in
,
and
*NL*
presently
brought
the
sharp
message
that
I
was
to
``
come
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
unchanged
,
and
Miss
Havisham
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
she
,
fixing
her
eyes
upon
me
.
``
I
hope
you
want
nothing
?
*NL*
You
'll
get
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
indeed
,
Miss
Havisham
.
I
only
wanted
you
to
know
that
I
am
doing
*NL*
very
well
in
my
apprenticeship
,
and
am
always
much
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
!
''
with
the
old
restless
fingers
.
``
Come
now
and
then
;
come
*NL*
on
your
birthday
.
--
Ay
!
''
she
cried
suddenly
,
turning
herself
and
her
*NL*
chair
towards
me
,
``
You
are
looking
round
for
Estella
?
Hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
looking
round
,
--
in
fact
,
for
Estella
,
--
and
I
stammered
that
I
*NL*
hoped
she
was
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Abroad
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
;
``
educating
for
a
lady
;
far
out
of
reach
;
*NL*
prettier
than
ever
;
admired
by
all
who
see
her
.
Do
you
feel
that
you
*NL*
have
lost
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
a
malignant
enjoyment
in
her
utterance
of
the
last
words
,
*NL*
and
she
broke
into
such
a
disagreeable
laugh
,
that
I
was
at
a
loss
what
*NL*
to
say
.
She
spared
me
the
trouble
of
considering
,
by
dismissing
me
.
When
*NL*
the
gate
was
closed
upon
me
by
Sarah
of
the
walnut-shell
countenance
,
I
*NL*
felt
more
than
ever
dissatisfied
with
my
home
and
with
my
trade
and
with
*NL*
everything
;
and
that
was
all
I
took
by
that
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
loitering
along
the
High
Street
,
looking
in
disconsolately
at
*NL*
the
shop
windows
,
and
thinking
what
I
would
buy
if
I
were
a
gentleman
,
*NL*
who
should
come
out
of
the
bookshop
but
Mr.
Wopsle
.
Mr.
Wopsle
had
in
*NL*
his
hand
the
affecting
tragedy
of
George
Barnwell
,
in
which
he
had
that
*NL*
moment
invested
sixpence
,
with
the
view
of
heaping
every
word
of
it
on
*NL*
the
head
of
Pumblechook
,
with
whom
he
was
going
to
drink
tea
.
No
sooner
*NL*
did
he
see
me
,
than
he
appeared
to
consider
that
a
special
Providence
*NL*
had
put
a
`
prentice
in
his
way
to
be
read
at
;
and
he
laid
hold
of
me
,
*NL*
and
insisted
on
my
accompanying
him
to
the
Pumblechookian
parlor
.
As
I
*NL*
knew
it
would
be
miserable
at
home
,
and
as
the
nights
were
dark
and
the
*NL*
way
was
dreary
,
and
almost
any
companionship
on
the
road
was
better
*NL*
than
none
,
I
made
no
great
resistance
;
consequently
,
we
turned
into
*NL*
Pumblechook
's
just
as
the
street
and
the
shops
were
lighting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
never
assisted
at
any
other
representation
of
George
Barnwell
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
long
it
may
usually
take
;
but
I
know
very
well
that
it
*NL*
took
until
half-past
nine
o
'
clock
that
night
,
and
that
when
Mr.
Wopsle
*NL*
got
into
Newgate
,
I
thought
he
never
would
go
to
the
scaffold
,
he
became
*NL*
so
much
slower
than
at
any
former
period
of
his
disgraceful
career
.
I
*NL*
thought
it
a
little
too
much
that
he
should
complain
of
being
cut
short
*NL*
in
his
flower
after
all
,
as
if
he
had
not
been
running
to
seed
,
leaf
*NL*
after
leaf
,
ever
since
his
course
began
.
This
,
however
,
was
a
*NL*
mere
question
of
length
and
wearisomeness
.
What
stung
me
,
was
the
*NL*
identification
of
the
whole
affair
with
my
unoffending
self
.
When
*NL*
Barnwell
began
to
go
wrong
,
I
declare
that
I
felt
positively
apologetic
,
*NL*
Pumblechook
's
indignant
stare
so
taxed
me
with
it
.
Wopsle
,
too
,
took
*NL*
pains
to
present
me
in
the
worst
light
.
At
once
ferocious
and
maudlin
,
I
*NL*
was
made
to
murder
my
uncle
with
no
extenuating
circumstances
whatever
;
*NL*
Millwood
put
me
down
in
argument
,
on
every
occasion
;
it
became
sheer
*NL*
monomania
in
my
master
's
daughter
to
care
a
button
for
me
;
and
all
I
can
*NL*
say
for
my
gasping
and
procrastinating
conduct
on
the
fatal
morning
,
is
,
*NL*
that
it
was
worthy
of
the
general
feebleness
of
my
character
.
Even
after
*NL*
I
was
happily
hanged
and
Wopsle
had
closed
the
book
,
Pumblechook
sat
*NL*
staring
at
me
,
and
shaking
his
head
,
and
saying
,
``
Take
warning
,
boy
,
*NL*
take
warning
!
''
as
if
it
were
a
well-known
fact
that
I
contemplated
*NL*
murdering
a
near
relation
,
provided
I
could
only
induce
one
to
have
the
*NL*
weakness
to
become
my
benefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
dark
night
when
it
was
all
over
,
and
when
I
set
out
with
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
on
the
walk
home
.
Beyond
town
,
we
found
a
heavy
mist
out
,
and
*NL*
it
fell
wet
and
thick
.
The
turnpike
lamp
was
a
blur
,
quite
out
of
the
*NL*
lamp
's
usual
place
apparently
,
and
its
rays
looked
solid
substance
on
*NL*
the
fog
.
We
were
noticing
this
,
and
saying
how
that
the
mist
rose
with
a
*NL*
change
of
wind
from
a
certain
quarter
of
our
marshes
,
when
we
came
upon
*NL*
a
man
,
slouching
under
the
lee
of
the
turnpike
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
''
we
said
,
stopping
.
``
Orlick
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
answered
,
slouching
out
.
``
I
was
standing
by
a
minute
,
on
the
*NL*
chance
of
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
late
,
''
I
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Orlick
not
unnaturally
answered
,
``
Well
?
And
you
're
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
,
''
said
Mr.
Wopsle
,
exalted
with
his
late
performance
,
--
``
we
*NL*
have
been
indulging
,
Mr.
Orlick
,
in
an
intellectual
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Orlick
growled
,
as
if
he
had
nothing
to
say
about
that
,
and
we
all
*NL*
went
on
together
.
I
asked
him
presently
whether
he
had
been
spending
his
*NL*
half-holiday
up
and
down
town
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
``
all
of
it
.
I
come
in
behind
yourself
.
I
did
n't
see
you
,
*NL*
but
I
must
have
been
pretty
close
behind
you
.
By
the
by
,
the
guns
is
*NL*
going
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Hulks
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
There
's
some
of
the
birds
flown
from
the
cages
.
The
guns
have
been
*NL*
going
since
dark
,
about
.
You
'll
hear
one
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
effect
,
we
had
not
walked
many
yards
further
,
when
the
*NL*
well-remembered
boom
came
towards
us
,
deadened
by
the
mist
,
and
heavily
*NL*
rolled
away
along
the
low
grounds
by
the
river
,
as
if
it
were
pursuing
*NL*
and
threatening
the
fugitives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
night
for
cutting
off
in
,
''
said
Orlick
.
``
We
'd
be
puzzled
how
to
*NL*
bring
down
a
jail-bird
on
the
wing
,
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
was
a
suggestive
one
to
me
,
and
I
thought
about
it
in
*NL*
silence
.
Mr.
Wopsle
,
as
the
ill-requited
uncle
of
the
evening
's
tragedy
,
*NL*
fell
to
meditating
aloud
in
his
garden
at
Camberwell
.
Orlick
,
with
his
*NL*
hands
in
his
pockets
,
slouched
heavily
at
my
side
.
It
was
very
dark
,
*NL*
very
wet
,
very
muddy
,
and
so
we
splashed
along
.
Now
and
then
,
the
sound
*NL*
of
the
signal
cannon
broke
upon
us
again
,
and
again
rolled
sulkily
along
*NL*
the
course
of
the
river
.
I
kept
myself
to
myself
and
my
thoughts
.
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
died
amiably
at
Camberwell
,
and
exceedingly
game
on
Bosworth
*NL*
Field
,
and
in
the
greatest
agonies
at
Glastonbury
.
Orlick
sometimes
*NL*
growled
,
``
Beat
it
out
,
beat
it
out
,
--
Old
Clem
!
With
a
clink
for
the
*NL*
stout
,
--
Old
Clem
!
''
I
thought
he
had
been
drinking
,
but
he
was
not
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
we
came
to
the
village
.
The
way
by
which
we
approached
it
took
us
*NL*
past
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
which
we
were
surprised
to
find
--
it
being
*NL*
eleven
o'clock
--
in
a
state
of
commotion
,
with
the
door
wide
open
,
and
*NL*
unwonted
lights
that
had
been
hastily
caught
up
and
put
down
scattered
*NL*
about
.
Mr.
Wopsle
dropped
in
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
-LRB-
surmising
that
*NL*
a
convict
had
been
taken
-RRB-
,
but
came
running
out
in
a
great
hurry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
something
wrong
,
''
said
he
,
without
stopping
,
``
up
at
your
place
,
*NL*
Pip
.
Run
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
I
asked
,
keeping
up
with
him
.
So
did
Orlick
,
at
my
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
quite
understand
.
The
house
seems
to
have
been
violently
*NL*
entered
when
Joe
Gargery
was
out
.
Supposed
by
convicts
.
Somebody
has
*NL*
been
attacked
and
hurt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
running
too
fast
to
admit
of
more
being
said
,
and
we
made
no
*NL*
stop
until
we
got
into
our
kitchen
.
It
was
full
of
people
;
the
whole
*NL*
village
was
there
,
or
in
the
yard
;
and
there
was
a
surgeon
,
and
there
*NL*
was
Joe
,
and
there
were
a
group
of
women
,
all
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
kitchen
.
The
unemployed
bystanders
drew
back
when
they
saw
me
,
*NL*
and
so
I
became
aware
of
my
sister
,
--
lying
without
sense
or
movement
on
*NL*
the
bare
boards
where
she
had
been
knocked
down
by
a
tremendous
blow
*NL*
on
the
back
of
the
head
,
dealt
by
some
unknown
hand
when
her
face
was
*NL*
turned
towards
the
fire
,
--
destined
never
to
be
on
the
Rampage
again
,
*NL*
while
she
was
the
wife
of
Joe
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
With
my
head
full
of
George
Barnwell
,
I
was
at
first
disposed
to
believe
*NL*
that
I
must
have
had
some
hand
in
the
attack
upon
my
sister
,
or
at
*NL*
all
events
that
as
her
near
relation
,
popularly
known
to
be
under
*NL*
obligations
to
her
,
I
was
a
more
legitimate
object
of
suspicion
than
*NL*
any
one
else
.
But
when
,
in
the
clearer
light
of
next
morning
,
I
began
to
*NL*
reconsider
the
matter
and
to
hear
it
discussed
around
me
on
all
sides
,
I
*NL*
took
another
view
of
the
case
,
which
was
more
reasonable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
had
been
at
the
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
,
smoking
his
pipe
,
from
a
*NL*
quarter
after
eight
o'clock
to
a
quarter
before
ten
.
While
he
was
there
,
*NL*
my
sister
had
been
seen
standing
at
the
kitchen
door
,
and
had
exchanged
*NL*
Good
Night
with
a
farm-laborer
going
home
.
The
man
could
not
be
more
*NL*
particular
as
to
the
time
at
which
he
saw
her
-LRB-
he
got
into
dense
*NL*
confusion
when
he
tried
to
be
-RRB-
,
than
that
it
must
have
been
before
nine
.
*NL*
When
Joe
went
home
at
five
minutes
before
ten
,
he
found
her
struck
down
*NL*
on
the
floor
,
and
promptly
called
in
assistance
.
The
fire
had
not
then
*NL*
burnt
unusually
low
,
nor
was
the
snuff
of
the
candle
very
long
;
the
*NL*
candle
,
however
,
had
been
blown
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
had
been
taken
away
from
any
part
of
the
house
.
Neither
,
beyond
*NL*
the
blowing
out
of
the
candle
,
--
which
stood
on
a
table
between
the
door
*NL*
and
my
sister
,
and
was
behind
her
when
she
stood
facing
the
fire
and
was
*NL*
struck
,
--
was
there
any
disarrangement
of
the
kitchen
,
excepting
such
*NL*
as
she
herself
had
made
,
in
falling
and
bleeding
.
But
,
there
was
one
*NL*
remarkable
piece
of
evidence
on
the
spot
.
She
had
been
struck
with
*NL*
something
blunt
and
heavy
,
on
the
head
and
spine
;
after
the
blows
were
*NL*
dealt
,
something
heavy
had
been
thrown
down
at
her
with
considerable
*NL*
violence
,
as
she
lay
on
her
face
.
And
on
the
ground
beside
her
,
when
Joe
*NL*
picked
her
up
,
was
a
convict
's
leg-iron
which
had
been
filed
asunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Joe
,
examining
this
iron
with
a
smith
's
eye
,
declared
it
to
have
*NL*
been
filed
asunder
some
time
ago
.
The
hue
and
cry
going
off
to
the
*NL*
Hulks
,
and
people
coming
thence
to
examine
the
iron
,
Joe
's
opinion
*NL*
was
corroborated
.
They
did
not
undertake
to
say
when
it
had
left
the
*NL*
prison-ships
to
which
it
undoubtedly
had
once
belonged
;
but
they
claimed
*NL*
to
know
for
certain
that
that
particular
manacle
had
not
been
worn
by
*NL*
either
of
the
two
convicts
who
had
escaped
last
night
.
Further
,
one
of
*NL*
those
two
was
already
retaken
,
and
had
not
freed
himself
of
his
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Knowing
what
I
knew
,
I
set
up
an
inference
of
my
own
here
.
I
believed
*NL*
the
iron
to
be
my
convict
's
iron
,
--
the
iron
I
had
seen
and
heard
him
*NL*
filing
at
,
on
the
marshes
,
--
but
my
mind
did
not
accuse
him
of
having
put
*NL*
it
to
its
latest
use
.
For
I
believed
one
of
two
other
persons
to
have
*NL*
become
possessed
of
it
,
and
to
have
turned
it
to
this
cruel
account
.
*NL*
Either
Orlick
,
or
the
strange
man
who
had
shown
me
the
file
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
to
Orlick
;
he
had
gone
to
town
exactly
as
he
told
us
when
we
*NL*
picked
him
up
at
the
turnpike
,
he
had
been
seen
about
town
all
the
*NL*
evening
,
he
had
been
in
divers
companies
in
several
public-houses
,
and
*NL*
he
had
come
back
with
myself
and
Mr.
Wopsle
.
There
was
nothing
against
*NL*
him
,
save
the
quarrel
;
and
my
sister
had
quarrelled
with
him
,
and
with
*NL*
everybody
else
about
her
,
ten
thousand
times
.
As
to
the
strange
man
;
if
*NL*
he
had
come
back
for
his
two
bank-notes
there
could
have
been
no
dispute
*NL*
about
them
,
because
my
sister
was
fully
prepared
to
restore
them
.
*NL*
Besides
,
there
had
been
no
altercation
;
the
assailant
had
come
in
so
*NL*
silently
and
suddenly
,
that
she
had
been
felled
before
she
could
look
*NL*
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
horrible
to
think
that
I
had
provided
the
weapon
,
however
*NL*
undesignedly
,
but
I
could
hardly
think
otherwise
.
I
suffered
unspeakable
*NL*
trouble
while
I
considered
and
reconsidered
whether
I
should
at
last
*NL*
dissolve
that
spell
of
my
childhood
and
tell
Joe
all
the
story
.
For
*NL*
months
afterwards
,
I
every
day
settled
the
question
finally
in
the
*NL*
negative
,
and
reopened
and
reargued
it
next
morning
.
The
contention
*NL*
came
,
after
all
,
to
this
;
--
the
secret
was
such
an
old
one
now
,
had
so
*NL*
grown
into
me
and
become
a
part
of
myself
,
that
I
could
not
tear
it
*NL*
away
.
In
addition
to
the
dread
that
,
having
led
up
to
so
much
mischief
,
*NL*
it
would
be
now
more
likely
than
ever
to
alienate
Joe
from
me
if
he
*NL*
believed
it
,
I
had
a
further
restraining
dread
that
he
would
not
believe
*NL*
it
,
but
would
assort
it
with
the
fabulous
dogs
and
veal-cutlets
as
a
*NL*
monstrous
invention
.
However
,
I
temporized
with
myself
,
of
course
--
for
,
*NL*
was
I
not
wavering
between
right
and
wrong
,
when
the
thing
is
always
*NL*
done
?
--
and
resolved
to
make
a
full
disclosure
if
I
should
see
any
*NL*
such
new
occasion
as
a
new
chance
of
helping
in
the
discovery
of
the
*NL*
assailant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Constables
and
the
Bow
Street
men
from
London
--
for
,
this
happened
in
*NL*
the
days
of
the
extinct
red-waistcoated
police
--
were
about
the
house
for
*NL*
a
week
or
two
,
and
did
pretty
much
what
I
have
heard
and
read
of
like
*NL*
authorities
doing
in
other
such
cases
.
They
took
up
several
obviously
*NL*
wrong
people
,
and
they
ran
their
heads
very
hard
against
wrong
ideas
,
*NL*
and
persisted
in
trying
to
fit
the
circumstances
to
the
ideas
,
instead
*NL*
of
trying
to
extract
ideas
from
the
circumstances
.
Also
,
they
stood
*NL*
about
the
door
of
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
with
knowing
and
reserved
looks
*NL*
that
filled
the
whole
neighborhood
with
admiration
;
and
they
had
a
*NL*
mysterious
manner
of
taking
their
drink
,
that
was
almost
as
good
as
*NL*
taking
the
culprit
.
But
not
quite
,
for
they
never
did
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
after
these
constitutional
powers
had
dispersed
,
my
sister
lay
very
*NL*
ill
in
bed
.
Her
sight
was
disturbed
,
so
that
she
saw
objects
multiplied
,
*NL*
and
grasped
at
visionary
teacups
and
wineglasses
instead
of
the
*NL*
realities
;
her
hearing
was
greatly
impaired
;
her
memory
also
;
and
her
*NL*
speech
was
unintelligible
.
When
,
at
last
,
she
came
round
so
far
as
to
*NL*
be
helped
downstairs
,
it
was
still
necessary
to
keep
my
slate
always
by
*NL*
her
,
that
she
might
indicate
in
writing
what
she
could
not
indicate
in
*NL*
speech
.
As
she
was
-LRB-
very
bad
handwriting
apart
-RRB-
a
more
than
indifferent
*NL*
speller
,
and
as
Joe
was
a
more
than
indifferent
reader
,
extraordinary
*NL*
complications
arose
between
them
which
I
was
always
called
in
to
solve
.
*NL*
The
administration
of
mutton
instead
of
medicine
,
the
substitution
of
*NL*
Tea
for
Joe
,
and
the
baker
for
bacon
,
were
among
the
mildest
of
my
own
*NL*
mistakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
her
temper
was
greatly
improved
,
and
she
was
patient
.
A
*NL*
tremulous
uncertainty
of
the
action
of
all
her
limbs
soon
became
a
*NL*
part
of
her
regular
state
,
and
afterwards
,
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
*NL*
months
,
she
would
often
put
her
hands
to
her
head
,
and
would
then
remain
*NL*
for
about
a
week
at
a
time
in
some
gloomy
aberration
of
mind
.
We
were
*NL*
at
a
loss
to
find
a
suitable
attendant
for
her
,
until
a
circumstance
*NL*
happened
conveniently
to
relieve
us
.
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
conquered
a
*NL*
confirmed
habit
of
living
into
which
she
had
fallen
,
and
Biddy
became
a
*NL*
part
of
our
establishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
have
been
about
a
month
after
my
sister
's
reappearance
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
when
Biddy
came
to
us
with
a
small
speckled
box
containing
the
*NL*
whole
of
her
worldly
effects
,
and
became
a
blessing
to
the
household
.
*NL*
Above
all
,
she
was
a
blessing
to
Joe
,
for
the
dear
old
fellow
was
sadly
*NL*
cut
up
by
the
constant
contemplation
of
the
wreck
of
his
wife
,
and
had
*NL*
been
accustomed
,
while
attending
on
her
of
an
evening
,
to
turn
to
me
*NL*
every
now
and
then
and
say
,
with
his
blue
eyes
moistened
,
``
Such
a
fine
*NL*
figure
of
a
woman
as
she
once
were
,
Pip
!
''
Biddy
instantly
taking
the
*NL*
cleverest
charge
of
her
as
though
she
had
studied
her
from
infancy
;
Joe
*NL*
became
able
in
some
sort
to
appreciate
the
greater
quiet
of
his
life
,
*NL*
and
to
get
down
to
the
Jolly
Bargemen
now
and
then
for
a
change
that
did
*NL*
him
good
.
It
was
characteristic
of
the
police
people
that
they
had
all
*NL*
more
or
less
suspected
poor
Joe
-LRB-
though
he
never
knew
it
-RRB-
,
and
that
they
*NL*
had
to
a
man
concurred
in
regarding
him
as
one
of
the
deepest
spirits
*NL*
they
had
ever
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
's
first
triumph
in
her
new
office
,
was
to
solve
a
difficulty
*NL*
that
had
completely
vanquished
me
.
I
had
tried
hard
at
it
,
but
had
made
*NL*
nothing
of
it
.
Thus
it
was
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Again
and
again
and
again
,
my
sister
had
traced
upon
the
slate
,
a
*NL*
character
that
looked
like
a
curious
T
,
and
then
with
the
utmost
*NL*
eagerness
had
called
our
attention
to
it
as
something
she
particularly
*NL*
wanted
.
I
had
in
vain
tried
everything
producible
that
began
with
a
T
,
*NL*
from
tar
to
toast
and
tub
.
At
length
it
had
come
into
my
head
that
the
*NL*
sign
looked
like
a
hammer
,
and
on
my
lustily
calling
that
word
in
my
*NL*
sister
's
ear
,
she
had
begun
to
hammer
on
the
table
and
had
expressed
a
*NL*
qualified
assent
.
Thereupon
,
I
had
brought
in
all
our
hammers
,
one
after
*NL*
another
,
but
without
avail
.
Then
I
bethought
me
of
a
crutch
,
the
shape
*NL*
being
much
the
same
,
and
I
borrowed
one
in
the
village
,
and
displayed
*NL*
it
to
my
sister
with
considerable
confidence
.
But
she
shook
her
head
to
*NL*
that
extent
when
she
was
shown
it
,
that
we
were
terrified
lest
in
her
*NL*
weak
and
shattered
state
she
should
dislocate
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
sister
found
that
Biddy
was
very
quick
to
understand
her
,
this
*NL*
mysterious
sign
reappeared
on
the
slate
.
Biddy
looked
thoughtfully
*NL*
at
it
,
heard
my
explanation
,
looked
thoughtfully
at
my
sister
,
looked
*NL*
thoughtfully
at
Joe
-LRB-
who
was
always
represented
on
the
slate
by
his
*NL*
initial
letter
-RRB-
,
and
ran
into
the
forge
,
followed
by
Joe
and
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
!
''
cried
Biddy
,
with
an
exultant
face
.
``
Do
n't
you
see
?
*NL*
It
's
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Orlick
,
without
a
doubt
!
She
had
lost
his
name
,
and
could
only
signify
*NL*
him
by
his
hammer
.
We
told
him
why
we
wanted
him
to
come
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
and
he
slowly
laid
down
his
hammer
,
wiped
his
brow
with
his
*NL*
arm
,
took
another
wipe
at
it
with
his
apron
,
and
came
slouching
*NL*
out
,
with
a
curious
loose
vagabond
bend
in
the
knees
that
strongly
*NL*
distinguished
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
that
I
expected
to
see
my
sister
denounce
him
,
and
that
I
*NL*
was
disappointed
by
the
different
result
.
She
manifested
the
greatest
*NL*
anxiety
to
be
on
good
terms
with
him
,
was
evidently
much
pleased
by
his
*NL*
being
at
length
produced
,
and
motioned
that
she
would
have
him
*NL*
given
something
to
drink
.
She
watched
his
countenance
as
if
she
were
*NL*
particularly
wishful
to
be
assured
that
he
took
kindly
to
his
reception
,
*NL*
she
showed
every
possible
desire
to
conciliate
him
,
and
there
was
an
air
*NL*
of
humble
propitiation
in
all
she
did
,
such
as
I
have
seen
pervade
the
*NL*
bearing
of
a
child
towards
a
hard
master
.
After
that
day
,
a
day
rarely
*NL*
passed
without
her
drawing
the
hammer
on
her
slate
,
and
without
Orlick
's
*NL*
slouching
in
and
standing
doggedly
before
her
,
as
if
he
knew
no
more
*NL*
than
I
did
what
to
make
of
it
.
*NL*

*NL*
Chapter
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
fell
into
a
regular
routine
of
apprenticeship
life
,
which
was
*NL*
varied
beyond
the
limits
of
the
village
and
the
marshes
,
by
no
more
*NL*
remarkable
circumstance
than
the
arrival
of
my
birthday
and
my
paying
*NL*
another
visit
to
Miss
Havisham
.
I
found
Miss
Sarah
Pocket
still
on
duty
*NL*
at
the
gate
;
I
found
Miss
Havisham
just
as
I
had
left
her
,
and
she
spoke
*NL*
of
Estella
in
the
very
same
way
,
if
not
in
the
very
same
words
.
The
*NL*
interview
lasted
but
a
few
minutes
,
and
she
gave
me
a
guinea
when
I
was
*NL*
going
,
and
told
me
to
come
again
on
my
next
birthday
.
I
may
mention
at
*NL*
once
that
this
became
an
annual
custom
.
I
tried
to
decline
taking
the
*NL*
guinea
on
the
first
occasion
,
but
with
no
better
effect
than
causing
her
*NL*
to
ask
me
very
angrily
,
if
I
expected
more
?
Then
,
and
after
that
,
I
took
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
unchanging
was
the
dull
old
house
,
the
yellow
light
in
the
darkened
*NL*
room
,
the
faded
spectre
in
the
chair
by
the
dressing-table
glass
,
that
*NL*
I
felt
as
if
the
stopping
of
the
clocks
had
stopped
Time
in
that
*NL*
mysterious
place
,
and
,
while
I
and
everything
else
outside
it
grew
*NL*
older
,
it
stood
still
.
Daylight
never
entered
the
house
as
to
my
*NL*
thoughts
and
remembrances
of
it
,
any
more
than
as
to
the
actual
fact
.
It
*NL*
bewildered
me
,
and
under
its
influence
I
continued
at
heart
to
hate
my
*NL*
trade
and
to
be
ashamed
of
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Imperceptibly
I
became
conscious
of
a
change
in
Biddy
,
however
.
Her
*NL*
shoes
came
up
at
the
heel
,
her
hair
grew
bright
and
neat
,
her
hands
were
*NL*
always
clean
.
She
was
not
beautiful
,
--
she
was
common
,
and
could
not
be
*NL*
like
Estella
,
--
but
she
was
pleasant
and
wholesome
and
sweet-tempered
.
*NL*
She
had
not
been
with
us
more
than
a
year
-LRB-
I
remember
her
being
newly
*NL*
out
of
mourning
at
the
time
it
struck
me
-RRB-
,
when
I
observed
to
myself
one
*NL*
evening
that
she
had
curiously
thoughtful
and
attentive
eyes
;
eyes
that
*NL*
were
very
pretty
and
very
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
of
my
lifting
up
my
own
eyes
from
a
task
I
was
poring
*NL*
at
--
writing
some
passages
from
a
book
,
to
improve
myself
in
two
ways
at
*NL*
once
by
a
sort
of
stratagem
--
and
seeing
Biddy
observant
of
what
I
was
*NL*
about
.
I
laid
down
my
pen
,
and
Biddy
stopped
in
her
needlework
without
*NL*
laying
it
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
how
do
you
manage
it
?
Either
I
am
very
stupid
,
or
you
*NL*
are
very
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
that
I
manage
?
I
do
n't
know
,
''
returned
Biddy
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
managed
our
whole
domestic
life
,
and
wonderfully
too
;
but
I
did
not
*NL*
mean
that
,
though
that
made
what
I
did
mean
more
surprising
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
manage
,
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
learn
everything
that
I
learn
,
*NL*
and
always
to
keep
up
with
me
?
''
I
was
beginning
to
be
rather
vain
of
*NL*
my
knowledge
,
for
I
spent
my
birthday
guineas
on
it
,
and
set
aside
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
my
pocket-money
for
similar
investment
;
though
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
,
now
,
that
the
little
I
knew
was
extremely
dear
at
the
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
as
well
ask
you
,
''
said
Biddy
,
``
how
you
manage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
because
when
I
come
in
from
the
forge
of
a
night
,
any
one
can
see
*NL*
me
turning
to
at
it
.
But
you
never
turn
to
at
it
,
Biddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
must
catch
it
like
a
cough
,
''
said
Biddy
,
quietly
;
and
went
*NL*
on
with
her
sewing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pursuing
my
idea
as
I
leaned
back
in
my
wooden
chair
,
and
looked
at
*NL*
Biddy
sewing
away
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
I
began
to
think
her
rather
*NL*
an
extraordinary
girl
.
For
I
called
to
mind
now
,
that
she
was
equally
*NL*
accomplished
in
the
terms
of
our
trade
,
and
the
names
of
our
different
*NL*
sorts
of
work
,
and
our
various
tools
.
In
short
,
whatever
I
knew
,
Biddy
*NL*
knew
.
Theoretically
,
she
was
already
as
good
a
blacksmith
as
I
,
or
*NL*
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
one
of
those
,
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
who
make
the
most
of
every
*NL*
chance
.
You
never
had
a
chance
before
you
came
here
,
and
see
how
*NL*
improved
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
looked
at
me
for
an
instant
,
and
went
on
with
her
sewing
.
``
I
was
*NL*
your
first
teacher
though
;
was
n't
I
?
''
said
she
,
as
she
sewed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
in
amazement
.
``
Why
,
you
are
crying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
I
am
not
,
''
said
Biddy
,
looking
up
and
laughing
.
``
What
put
that
in
*NL*
your
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
have
put
it
in
my
head
but
the
glistening
of
a
tear
as
it
*NL*
dropped
on
her
work
?
I
sat
silent
,
recalling
what
a
drudge
she
had
been
*NL*
until
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
successfully
overcame
that
bad
habit
of
*NL*
living
,
so
highly
desirable
to
be
got
rid
of
by
some
people
.
I
recalled
*NL*
the
hopeless
circumstances
by
which
she
had
been
surrounded
in
the
*NL*
miserable
little
shop
and
the
miserable
little
noisy
evening
school
,
*NL*
with
that
miserable
old
bundle
of
incompetence
always
to
be
dragged
and
*NL*
shouldered
.
I
reflected
that
even
in
those
untoward
times
there
must
*NL*
have
been
latent
in
Biddy
what
was
now
developing
,
for
,
in
my
first
*NL*
uneasiness
and
discontent
I
had
turned
to
her
for
help
,
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
.
Biddy
sat
quietly
sewing
,
shedding
no
more
tears
,
and
while
I
*NL*
looked
at
her
and
thought
about
it
all
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
*NL*
I
had
not
been
sufficiently
grateful
to
Biddy
.
I
might
have
been
too
*NL*
reserved
,
and
should
have
patronized
her
more
-LRB-
though
I
did
not
use
that
*NL*
precise
word
in
my
meditations
-RRB-
with
my
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Biddy
,
''
I
observed
,
when
I
had
done
turning
it
over
,
``
you
were
my
*NL*
first
teacher
,
and
that
at
a
time
when
we
little
thought
of
ever
being
*NL*
together
like
this
,
in
this
kitchen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
poor
thing
!
''
replied
Biddy
.
It
was
like
her
self-forgetfulness
to
*NL*
transfer
the
remark
to
my
sister
,
and
to
get
up
and
be
busy
about
her
,
*NL*
making
her
more
comfortable
;
``
that
's
sadly
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
I
,
``
we
must
talk
together
a
little
more
,
as
we
used
to
do
.
*NL*
And
I
must
consult
you
a
little
more
,
as
I
used
to
do
.
Let
us
have
a
*NL*
quiet
walk
on
the
marshes
next
Sunday
,
Biddy
,
and
a
long
chat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
was
never
left
alone
now
;
but
Joe
more
than
readily
undertook
*NL*
the
care
of
her
on
that
Sunday
afternoon
,
and
Biddy
and
I
went
out
*NL*
together
.
It
was
summer-time
,
and
lovely
weather
.
When
we
had
passed
the
*NL*
village
and
the
church
and
the
churchyard
,
and
were
out
on
the
marshes
*NL*
and
began
to
see
the
sails
of
the
ships
as
they
sailed
on
,
I
began
to
*NL*
combine
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
with
the
prospect
,
in
my
usual
way
.
*NL*
When
we
came
to
the
river-side
and
sat
down
on
the
bank
,
with
the
water
*NL*
rippling
at
our
feet
,
making
it
all
more
quiet
than
it
would
have
been
*NL*
without
that
sound
,
I
resolved
that
it
was
a
good
time
and
place
for
the
*NL*
admission
of
Biddy
into
my
inner
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
after
binding
her
to
secrecy
,
``
I
want
to
be
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
would
n't
,
if
I
was
you
!
''
she
returned
.
``
I
do
n't
think
it
would
*NL*
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
with
some
severity
,
``
I
have
particular
reasons
for
*NL*
wanting
to
be
a
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
best
,
Pip
;
but
do
n't
you
think
you
are
happier
as
you
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
I
exclaimed
,
impatiently
,
``
I
am
not
at
all
happy
as
I
am
.
I
*NL*
am
disgusted
with
my
calling
and
with
my
life
.
I
have
never
taken
to
*NL*
either
,
since
I
was
bound
.
Do
n't
be
absurd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
absurd
?
''
said
Biddy
,
quietly
raising
her
eyebrows
;
``
I
am
sorry
*NL*
for
that
;
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
.
I
only
want
you
to
do
well
,
and
to
be
*NL*
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
understand
once
for
all
that
I
never
shall
or
can
be
*NL*
comfortable
--
or
anything
but
miserable
--
there
,
Biddy
!
--
unless
I
can
lead
*NL*
a
very
different
sort
of
life
from
the
life
I
lead
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
pity
!
''
said
Biddy
,
shaking
her
head
with
a
sorrowful
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
I
too
had
so
often
thought
it
a
pity
,
that
,
in
the
singular
kind
of
*NL*
quarrel
with
myself
which
I
was
always
carrying
on
,
I
was
half
inclined
*NL*
to
shed
tears
of
vexation
and
distress
when
Biddy
gave
utterance
to
her
*NL*
sentiment
and
my
own
.
I
told
her
she
was
right
,
and
I
knew
it
was
much
*NL*
to
be
regretted
,
but
still
it
was
not
to
be
helped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
have
settled
down
,
''
I
said
to
Biddy
,
plucking
up
the
short
*NL*
grass
within
reach
,
much
as
I
had
once
upon
a
time
pulled
my
feelings
*NL*
out
of
my
hair
and
kicked
them
into
the
brewery
wall
,
--
``
if
I
could
have
*NL*
settled
down
and
been
but
half
as
fond
of
the
forge
as
I
was
when
I
was
*NL*
little
,
I
know
it
would
have
been
much
better
for
me
.
You
and
I
and
Joe
*NL*
would
have
wanted
nothing
then
,
and
Joe
and
I
would
perhaps
have
gone
*NL*
partners
when
I
was
out
of
my
time
,
and
I
might
even
have
grown
up
to
*NL*
keep
company
with
you
,
and
we
might
have
sat
on
this
very
bank
on
a
fine
*NL*
Sunday
,
quite
different
people
.
I
should
have
been
good
enough
for
you
;
*NL*
should
n't
I
,
Biddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
sighed
as
she
looked
at
the
ships
sailing
on
,
and
returned
for
*NL*
answer
,
``
Yes
;
I
am
not
over-particular
.
''
It
scarcely
sounded
flattering
,
*NL*
but
I
knew
she
meant
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Instead
of
that
,
''
said
I
,
plucking
up
more
grass
and
chewing
a
blade
or
*NL*
two
,
``
see
how
I
am
going
on
.
Dissatisfied
,
and
uncomfortable
,
and
--
what
*NL*
would
it
signify
to
me
,
being
coarse
and
common
,
if
nobody
had
told
me
*NL*
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
turned
her
face
suddenly
towards
mine
,
and
looked
far
more
*NL*
attentively
at
me
than
she
had
looked
at
the
sailing
ships
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
neither
a
very
true
nor
a
very
polite
thing
to
say
,
''
she
*NL*
remarked
,
directing
her
eyes
to
the
ships
again
.
``
Who
said
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
disconcerted
,
for
I
had
broken
away
without
quite
seeing
where
*NL*
I
was
going
to
.
It
was
not
to
be
shuffled
off
now
,
however
,
and
I
*NL*
answered
,
``
The
beautiful
young
lady
at
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
she
's
more
*NL*
beautiful
than
anybody
ever
was
,
and
I
admire
her
dreadfully
,
and
I
want
*NL*
to
be
a
gentleman
on
her
account
.
''
Having
made
this
lunatic
confession
,
*NL*
I
began
to
throw
my
torn-up
grass
into
the
river
,
as
if
I
had
some
*NL*
thoughts
of
following
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
be
a
gentleman
,
to
spite
her
or
to
gain
her
over
?
''
Biddy
*NL*
quietly
asked
me
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
I
moodily
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
if
it
is
to
spite
her
,
''
Biddy
pursued
,
``
I
should
think
--
but
*NL*
you
know
best
--
that
might
be
better
and
more
independently
done
by
*NL*
caring
nothing
for
her
words
.
And
if
it
is
to
gain
her
over
,
I
should
*NL*
think
--
but
you
know
best
--
she
was
not
worth
gaining
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Exactly
what
I
myself
had
thought
,
many
times
.
Exactly
what
was
*NL*
perfectly
manifest
to
me
at
the
moment
.
But
how
could
I
,
a
poor
dazed
*NL*
village
lad
,
avoid
that
wonderful
inconsistency
into
which
the
best
and
*NL*
wisest
of
men
fall
every
day
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
all
quite
true
,
''
said
I
to
Biddy
,
``
but
I
admire
her
*NL*
dreadfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
turned
over
on
my
face
when
I
came
to
that
,
and
got
a
good
*NL*
grasp
on
the
hair
on
each
side
of
my
head
,
and
wrenched
it
well
.
All
the
*NL*
while
knowing
the
madness
of
my
heart
to
be
so
very
mad
and
misplaced
,
*NL*
that
I
was
quite
conscious
it
would
have
served
my
face
right
,
if
I
*NL*
had
lifted
it
up
by
my
hair
,
and
knocked
it
against
the
pebbles
as
a
*NL*
punishment
for
belonging
to
such
an
idiot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
was
the
wisest
of
girls
,
and
she
tried
to
reason
no
more
with
me
.
*NL*
She
put
her
hand
,
which
was
a
comfortable
hand
though
roughened
by
work
,
*NL*
upon
my
hands
,
one
after
another
,
and
gently
took
them
out
of
my
hair
.
*NL*
Then
she
softly
patted
my
shoulder
in
a
soothing
way
,
while
with
my
face
*NL*
upon
my
sleeve
I
cried
a
little
,
--
exactly
as
I
had
done
in
the
brewery
*NL*
yard
,
--
and
felt
vaguely
convinced
that
I
was
very
much
ill-used
by
*NL*
somebody
,
or
by
everybody
;
I
ca
n't
say
which
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
one
thing
,
''
said
Biddy
,
``
and
that
is
,
that
you
have
felt
*NL*
you
could
give
me
your
confidence
,
Pip
.
And
I
am
glad
of
another
thing
,
*NL*
and
that
is
,
that
of
course
you
know
you
may
depend
upon
my
keeping
it
*NL*
and
always
so
far
deserving
it
.
If
your
first
teacher
-LRB-
dear
!
such
a
poor
*NL*
one
,
and
so
much
in
need
of
being
taught
herself
!
-RRB-
had
been
your
teacher
*NL*
at
the
present
time
,
she
thinks
she
knows
what
lesson
she
would
set
.
But
*NL*
it
would
be
a
hard
one
to
learn
,
and
you
have
got
beyond
her
,
and
it
's
*NL*
of
no
use
now
.
''
So
,
with
a
quiet
sigh
for
me
,
Biddy
rose
from
the
bank
,
*NL*
and
said
,
with
a
fresh
and
pleasant
change
of
voice
,
``
Shall
we
walk
a
*NL*
little
farther
,
or
go
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
I
cried
,
getting
up
,
putting
my
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
giving
*NL*
her
a
kiss
,
``
I
shall
always
tell
you
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
you
're
a
gentleman
,
''
said
Biddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
never
shall
be
,
so
that
's
always
.
Not
that
I
have
any
*NL*
occasion
to
tell
you
anything
,
for
you
know
everything
I
know
,
--
as
I
*NL*
told
you
at
home
the
other
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Biddy
,
quite
in
a
whisper
,
as
she
looked
away
at
the
ships
.
*NL*
And
then
repeated
,
with
her
former
pleasant
change
,
``
shall
we
walk
a
*NL*
little
farther
,
or
go
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
to
Biddy
we
would
walk
a
little
farther
,
and
we
did
so
,
and
the
*NL*
summer
afternoon
toned
down
into
the
summer
evening
,
and
it
was
very
*NL*
beautiful
.
I
began
to
consider
whether
I
was
not
more
naturally
and
*NL*
wholesomely
situated
,
after
all
,
in
these
circumstances
,
than
playing
*NL*
beggar
my
neighbor
by
candle-light
in
the
room
with
the
stopped
clocks
,
*NL*
and
being
despised
by
Estella
.
I
thought
it
would
be
very
good
for
me
if
*NL*
I
could
get
her
out
of
my
head
,
with
all
the
rest
of
those
remembrances
*NL*
and
fancies
,
and
could
go
to
work
determined
to
relish
what
I
had
to
do
,
*NL*
and
stick
to
it
,
and
make
the
best
of
it
.
I
asked
myself
the
question
*NL*
whether
I
did
not
surely
know
that
if
Estella
were
beside
me
at
that
*NL*
moment
instead
of
Biddy
,
she
would
make
me
miserable
?
I
was
obliged
to
*NL*
admit
that
I
did
know
it
for
a
certainty
,
and
I
said
to
myself
,
``
Pip
,
*NL*
what
a
fool
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
talked
a
good
deal
as
we
walked
,
and
all
that
Biddy
said
seemed
*NL*
right
.
Biddy
was
never
insulting
,
or
capricious
,
or
Biddy
to-day
and
*NL*
somebody
else
to-morrow
;
she
would
have
derived
only
pain
,
and
no
*NL*
pleasure
,
from
giving
me
pain
;
she
would
far
rather
have
wounded
her
own
*NL*
breast
than
mine
.
How
could
it
be
,
then
,
that
I
did
not
like
her
much
*NL*
the
better
of
the
two
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
when
we
were
walking
homeward
,
``
I
wish
you
could
put
me
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
!
''
said
Biddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
only
get
myself
to
fall
in
love
with
you
,
--
you
do
n't
mind
my
*NL*
speaking
so
openly
to
such
an
old
acquaintance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
not
at
all
!
''
said
Biddy
.
``
Do
n't
mind
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
only
get
myself
to
do
it
,
that
would
be
the
thing
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
never
will
,
you
see
,
''
said
Biddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
appear
quite
so
unlikely
to
me
that
evening
,
as
it
would
have
*NL*
done
if
we
had
discussed
it
a
few
hours
before
.
I
therefore
observed
*NL*
I
was
not
quite
sure
of
that
.
But
Biddy
said
she
was
,
and
she
said
it
*NL*
decisively
.
In
my
heart
I
believed
her
to
be
right
;
and
yet
I
took
it
*NL*
rather
ill
,
too
,
that
she
should
be
so
positive
on
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
near
the
churchyard
,
we
had
to
cross
an
embankment
,
and
*NL*
get
over
a
stile
near
a
sluice-gate
.
There
started
up
,
from
the
gate
,
or
*NL*
from
the
rushes
,
or
from
the
ooze
-LRB-
which
was
quite
in
his
stagnant
way
-RRB-
,
*NL*
Old
Orlick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
''
he
growled
,
``
where
are
you
two
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
should
we
be
going
,
but
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
'm
jiggered
if
I
do
n't
see
you
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
penalty
of
being
jiggered
was
a
favorite
supposititious
case
of
*NL*
his
.
He
attached
no
definite
meaning
to
the
word
that
I
am
aware
of
,
but
*NL*
used
it
,
like
his
own
pretended
Christian
name
,
to
affront
mankind
,
and
*NL*
convey
an
idea
of
something
savagely
damaging
.
When
I
was
younger
,
I
*NL*
had
had
a
general
belief
that
if
he
had
jiggered
me
personally
,
he
would
*NL*
have
done
it
with
a
sharp
and
twisted
hook
.
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
was
much
against
his
going
with
us
,
and
said
to
me
in
a
whisper
,
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
him
come
;
I
do
n't
like
him
.
''
As
I
did
not
like
him
either
,
*NL*
I
took
the
liberty
of
saying
that
we
thanked
him
,
but
we
did
n't
want
*NL*
seeing
home
.
He
received
that
piece
of
information
with
a
yell
of
*NL*
laughter
,
and
dropped
back
,
but
came
slouching
after
us
at
a
little
*NL*
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curious
to
know
whether
Biddy
suspected
him
of
having
had
a
hand
in
*NL*
that
murderous
attack
of
which
my
sister
had
never
been
able
to
give
any
*NL*
account
,
I
asked
her
why
she
did
not
like
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
replied
,
glancing
over
her
shoulder
as
he
slouched
after
us
,
*NL*
``
because
I
--
I
am
afraid
he
likes
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
ever
tell
you
he
liked
you
?
''
I
asked
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Biddy
,
glancing
over
her
shoulder
again
,
``
he
never
told
me
*NL*
so
;
but
he
dances
at
me
,
whenever
he
can
catch
my
eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
novel
and
peculiar
this
testimony
of
attachment
,
I
did
not
*NL*
doubt
the
accuracy
of
the
interpretation
.
I
was
very
hot
indeed
upon
*NL*
Old
Orlick
's
daring
to
admire
her
;
as
hot
as
if
it
were
an
outrage
on
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
,
you
know
,
''
said
Biddy
,
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Biddy
,
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
;
only
I
do
n't
like
it
;
I
do
n't
*NL*
approve
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
neither
,
''
said
Biddy
.
``
Though
that
makes
no
difference
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
''
said
I
;
``
but
I
must
tell
you
I
should
have
no
opinion
of
you
,
*NL*
Biddy
,
if
he
danced
at
you
with
your
own
consent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
an
eye
on
Orlick
after
that
night
,
and
,
whenever
circumstances
*NL*
were
favorable
to
his
dancing
at
Biddy
,
got
before
him
to
obscure
that
*NL*
demonstration
.
He
had
struck
root
in
Joe
's
establishment
,
by
reason
*NL*
of
my
sister
's
sudden
fancy
for
him
,
or
I
should
have
tried
to
get
him
*NL*
dismissed
.
He
quite
understood
and
reciprocated
my
good
intentions
,
as
I
*NL*
had
reason
to
know
thereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
because
my
mind
was
not
confused
enough
before
,
I
complicated
*NL*
its
confusion
fifty
thousand-fold
,
by
having
states
and
seasons
when
I
*NL*
was
clear
that
Biddy
was
immeasurably
better
than
Estella
,
and
that
the
*NL*
plain
honest
working
life
to
which
I
was
born
had
nothing
in
it
to
*NL*
be
ashamed
of
,
but
offered
me
sufficient
means
of
self-respect
*NL*
and
happiness
.
At
those
times
,
I
would
decide
conclusively
that
my
*NL*
disaffection
to
dear
old
Joe
and
the
forge
was
gone
,
and
that
I
was
*NL*
growing
up
in
a
fair
way
to
be
partners
with
Joe
and
to
keep
company
*NL*
with
Biddy
,
--
when
all
in
a
moment
some
confounding
remembrance
of
the
*NL*
Havisham
days
would
fall
upon
me
like
a
destructive
missile
,
and
scatter
*NL*
my
wits
again
.
Scattered
wits
take
a
long
time
picking
up
;
and
often
*NL*
before
I
had
got
them
well
together
,
they
would
be
dispersed
in
all
*NL*
directions
by
one
stray
thought
,
that
perhaps
after
all
Miss
Havisham
*NL*
was
going
to
make
my
fortune
when
my
time
was
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
my
time
had
run
out
,
it
would
have
left
me
still
at
the
height
of
my
*NL*
perplexities
,
I
dare
say
.
It
never
did
run
out
,
however
,
but
was
brought
*NL*
to
a
premature
end
,
as
I
proceed
to
relate
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
fourth
year
of
my
apprenticeship
to
Joe
,
and
it
was
a
*NL*
Saturday
night
.
There
was
a
group
assembled
round
the
fire
at
the
Three
*NL*
Jolly
Bargemen
,
attentive
to
Mr.
Wopsle
as
he
read
the
newspaper
aloud
.
*NL*
Of
that
group
I
was
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
highly
popular
murder
had
been
committed
,
and
Mr.
Wopsle
was
imbrued
*NL*
in
blood
to
the
eyebrows
.
He
gloated
over
every
abhorrent
adjective
*NL*
in
the
description
,
and
identified
himself
with
every
witness
at
the
*NL*
Inquest
.
He
faintly
moaned
,
``
I
am
done
for
,
''
as
the
victim
,
and
he
*NL*
barbarously
bellowed
,
``
I
'll
serve
you
out
,
''
as
the
murderer
.
He
gave
the
*NL*
medical
testimony
,
in
pointed
imitation
of
our
local
practitioner
;
and
*NL*
he
piped
and
shook
,
as
the
aged
turnpike-keeper
who
had
heard
blows
,
to
*NL*
an
extent
so
very
paralytic
as
to
suggest
a
doubt
regarding
the
mental
*NL*
competency
of
that
witness
.
The
coroner
,
in
Mr.
Wopsle
's
hands
,
became
*NL*
Timon
of
Athens
;
the
beadle
,
Coriolanus
.
He
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
,
*NL*
and
we
all
enjoyed
ourselves
,
and
were
delightfully
comfortable
.
In
this
*NL*
cosey
state
of
mind
we
came
to
the
verdict
Wilful
Murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
and
not
sooner
,
I
became
aware
of
a
strange
gentleman
leaning
over
*NL*
the
back
of
the
settle
opposite
me
,
looking
on
.
There
was
an
expression
*NL*
of
contempt
on
his
face
,
and
he
bit
the
side
of
a
great
forefinger
as
he
*NL*
watched
the
group
of
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
the
stranger
to
Mr.
Wopsle
,
when
the
reading
was
done
,
``
you
*NL*
have
settled
it
all
to
your
own
satisfaction
,
I
have
no
doubt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
started
and
looked
up
,
as
if
it
were
the
murderer
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
everybody
coldly
and
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guilty
,
of
course
?
''
said
he
.
``
Out
with
it
.
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
returned
Mr.
Wopsle
,
``
without
having
the
honor
of
your
*NL*
acquaintance
,
I
do
say
Guilty
.
''
Upon
this
we
all
took
courage
to
unite
*NL*
in
a
confirmatory
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
do
,
''
said
the
stranger
;
``
I
knew
you
would
.
I
told
you
so
.
*NL*
But
now
I
'll
ask
you
a
question
.
Do
you
know
,
or
do
you
not
know
,
*NL*
that
the
law
of
England
supposes
every
man
to
be
innocent
,
until
he
is
*NL*
proved
--
proved
--
to
be
guilty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
Mr.
Wopsle
began
to
reply
,
``
as
an
Englishman
myself
,
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
the
stranger
,
biting
his
forefinger
at
him
.
``
Do
n't
evade
*NL*
the
question
.
Either
you
know
it
,
or
you
do
n't
know
it
.
Which
is
it
to
*NL*
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
himself
on
one
side
,
in
a
*NL*
bullying
,
interrogative
manner
,
and
he
threw
his
forefinger
at
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
,
--
as
it
were
to
mark
him
out
--
before
biting
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
!
''
said
he
.
``
Do
you
know
it
,
or
do
n't
you
know
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
know
it
,
''
replied
Mr.
Wopsle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
you
know
it
.
Then
why
did
n't
you
say
so
at
first
?
Now
,
I
'll
*NL*
ask
you
another
question
,
''
--
taking
possession
of
Mr.
Wopsle
,
as
if
he
*NL*
had
a
right
to
him
,
--
``
do
you
know
that
none
of
these
witnesses
have
yet
*NL*
been
cross-examined
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
was
beginning
,
``
I
can
only
say
--
''
when
the
stranger
stopped
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
You
wo
n't
answer
the
question
,
yes
or
no
?
Now
,
I
'll
try
you
*NL*
again
.
''
Throwing
his
finger
at
him
again
.
``
Attend
to
me
.
Are
you
*NL*
aware
,
or
are
you
not
aware

that
none
of
these
witnesses

yet
been
*NL*
cross-examined
?
Come
,
I
only
want
one
word
from
you
.
Yes
,
or
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
hesitated
,
and
we
all
began
to
conceive
rather
a
poor
opinion
*NL*
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
the
stranger
,
``
I
'll
help
you

You
do
n't
deserve
help

I
'll

*NL*
``

Mr.
Wopsle
,
eyeing
it

much
at
a
loss

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it

pursued
the
stranger
in
his
most
sarcastic
and
suspicious

manner

the
printed

have
just
been

*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly

*NL*

``

Now
,
turn
to
that
paper
,

tell

whether
it
distinctly

states

said

``

Mr.

pleaded

-LRB-
We
all
began
to
think
Mr.
Wopsle
full
of
*NL*
subterfuge
.
-RRB-
``
Well
?
Have
you
found
it

*NL*

``

Mr.

answered

looking
round
at

extended

*NL*
*NL*
We
all
began
to
suspect
that
Mr.

was
not
the

had
thought

him

that
he
was
beginning

pursued
the

,
throwing
his

finger
at
Mr.
Wopsle
heavily
,

``
that

be
summoned
as
a

juryman
upon

committed

might
return

''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
all
deeply
persuaded
that
the
unfortunate
Wopsle
had
gone
too
*NL*
far
,

had
better
stop
in
his
reckless
career

there
was

with

manner
expressive
of
knowing
something
secret
about
every
one
of
*NL*
us
that
would
effectually
do
for
each
individual
if
he
chose
to
disclose
*NL*
it
,
left
the
back
of
the
settle
,
and
came
into
the
space
between
the
two
*NL*
settles
,
in
front
of
the
fire
,
where
he
remained
standing
,
his
left
hand
*NL*
in
his
pocket
,
and
he
biting
the
forefinger
of
his
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
information
I
have
received
,
''
said
he
,
looking
round
at
us
as
we
*NL*
all
quailed
before
him
,
``
I
have
reason
to
believe
there
is
a
blacksmith
*NL*
among
you
,
by
name
Joseph
--
or
Joe
--
Gargery
.
Which
is
the
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
man
,
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strange
gentleman
beckoned
him
out
of
his
place
,
and
Joe
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
an
apprentice
,
''
pursued
the
stranger
,
``
commonly
known
as
Pip
?
*NL*
Is
he
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
!
''
I
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
did
not
recognize
me
,
but
I
recognized
him
as
the
gentleman
*NL*
I
had
met
on
the
stairs
,
on
the
occasion
of
my
second
visit
to
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
.
I
had
known
him
the
moment
I
saw
him
looking
over
the
settle
,
*NL*
and
now
that
I
stood
confronting
him
with
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
I
checked
off
again
in
detail
his
large
head
,
his
dark
complexion
,
his
*NL*
deep-set
eyes
,
his
bushy
black
eyebrows
,
his
large
watch-chain
,
his
*NL*
strong
black
dots
of
beard
and
whisker
,
and
even
the
smell
of
scented
*NL*
soap
on
his
great
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
have
a
private
conference
with
you
two
,
''
said
he
,
when
he
had
*NL*
surveyed
me
at
his
leisure
.
``
It
will
take
a
little
time
.
Perhaps
we
*NL*
had
better
go
to
your
place
of
residence
.
I
prefer
not
to
anticipate
my
*NL*
communication
here
;
you
will
impart
as
much
or
as
little
of
it
as
you
*NL*
please
to
your
friends
afterwards
;
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amidst
a
wondering
silence
,
we
three
walked
out
of
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
*NL*
and
in
a
wondering
silence
walked
home
.
While
going
along
,
the
strange
*NL*
gentleman
occasionally
looked
at
me
,
and
occasionally
bit
the
side
of
*NL*
his
finger
.
As
we
neared
home
,
Joe
vaguely
acknowledging
the
occasion
as
*NL*
an
impressive
and
ceremonious
one
,
went
on
ahead
to
open
the
front
door
.
*NL*
Our
conference
was
held
in
the
state
parlor
,
which
was
feebly
lighted
by
*NL*
one
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
with
the
strange
gentleman
's
sitting
down
at
the
table
,
drawing
*NL*
the
candle
to
him
,
and
looking
over
some
entries
in
his
pocket-book
.
*NL*
He
then
put
up
the
pocket-book
and
set
the
candle
a
little
aside
,
after
*NL*
peering
round
it
into
the
darkness
at
Joe
and
me
,
to
ascertain
which
was
*NL*
which
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
Jaggers
,
and
I
am
a
lawyer
in
London
.
I
am
*NL*
pretty
well
known
.
I
have
unusual
business
to
transact
with
you
,
and
I
*NL*
commence
by
explaining
that
it
is
not
of
my
originating
.
If
my
advice
*NL*
had
been
asked
,
I
should
not
have
been
here
.
It
was
not
asked
,
and
you
*NL*
see
me
here
.
What
I
have
to
do
as
the
confidential
agent
of
another
,
I
*NL*
do
.
No
less
,
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
that
he
could
not
see
us
very
well
from
where
he
sat
,
he
got
*NL*
up
,
and
threw
one
leg
over
the
back
of
a
chair
and
leaned
upon
it
;
thus
*NL*
having
one
foot
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
,
and
one
foot
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Joseph
Gargery
,
I
am
the
bearer
of
an
offer
to
relieve
you
of
*NL*
this
young
fellow
your
apprentice
.
You
would
not
object
to
cancel
his
*NL*
indentures
at
his
request
and
for
his
good
?
You
would
want
nothing
for
*NL*
so
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
forbid
that
I
should
want
anything
for
not
standing
in
Pip
's
way
,
''
*NL*
said
Joe
,
staring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
forbidding
is
pious
,
but
not
to
the
purpose
,
''
returned
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
.
``
The
question
is
,
Would
you
want
anything
?
Do
you
want
*NL*
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
answer
is
,
''
returned
Joe
,
sternly
,
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
Mr.
Jaggers
glanced
at
Joe
,
as
if
he
considered
him
a
fool
for
*NL*
his
disinterestedness
.
But
I
was
too
much
bewildered
between
breathless
*NL*
curiosity
and
surprise
,
to
be
sure
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
Recollect
the
admission
you
have
made
,
*NL*
and
do
n't
try
to
go
from
it
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
a
going
to
try
?
''
retorted
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
say
anybody
is
.
Do
you
keep
a
dog
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
keep
a
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bear
in
mind
then
,
that
Brag
is
a
good
dog
,
but
Holdfast
is
a
better
.
*NL*
Bear
that
in
mind
,
will
you
?
''
repeated
Mr.
Jaggers
,
shutting
his
eyes
*NL*
and
nodding
his
head
at
Joe
,
as
if
he
were
forgiving
him
something
.
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
return
to
this
young
fellow
.
And
the
communication
I
have
got
to
*NL*
make
is
,
that
he
has
great
expectations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
and
I
gasped
,
and
looked
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
instructed
to
communicate
to
him
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
throwing
*NL*
his
finger
at
me
sideways
,
``
that
he
will
come
into
a
handsome
property
.
*NL*
Further
,
that
it
is
the
desire
of
the
present
possessor
of
that
*NL*
property
,
that
he
be
immediately
removed
from
his
present
sphere
of
life
*NL*
and
from
this
place
,
and
be
brought
up
as
a
gentleman
,
--
in
a
word
,
as
a
*NL*
young
fellow
of
great
expectations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
dream
was
out
;
my
wild
fancy
was
surpassed
by
sober
reality
;
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
was
going
to
make
my
fortune
on
a
grand
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
pursued
the
lawyer
,
``
I
address
the
rest
of
what
I
have
*NL*
to
say
,
to
you
.
You
are
to
understand
,
first
,
that
it
is
the
request
*NL*
of
the
person
from
whom
I
take
my
instructions
that
you
always
bear
*NL*
the
name
of
Pip
.
You
will
have
no
objection
,
I
dare
say
,
to
your
great
*NL*
expectations
being
encumbered
with
that
easy
condition
.
But
if
you
have
*NL*
any
objection
,
this
is
the
time
to
mention
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
was
beating
so
fast
,
and
there
was
such
a
singing
in
my
ears
,
*NL*
that
I
could
scarcely
stammer
I
had
no
objection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
not
!
Now
you
are
to
understand
,
secondly
,
Mr.
Pip
,
that
*NL*
the
name
of
the
person
who
is
your
liberal
benefactor
remains
a
profound
*NL*
secret
,
until
the
person
chooses
to
reveal
it
.
I
am
empowered
to
mention
*NL*
that
it
is
the
intention
of
the
person
to
reveal
it
at
first
hand
by
*NL*
word
of
mouth
to
yourself
.
When
or
where
that
intention
may
be
carried
*NL*
out
,
I
can
not
say
;
no
one
can
say
.
It
may
be
years
hence
.
Now
,
you
are
*NL*
distinctly
to
understand
that
you
are
most
positively
prohibited
from
*NL*
making
any
inquiry
on
this
head
,
or
any
allusion
or
reference
,
however
*NL*
distant
,
to
any
individual
whomsoever
as
the
individual
,
in
all
the
*NL*
communications
you
may
have
with
me
.
If
you
have
a
suspicion
in
your
own
*NL*
breast
,
keep
that
suspicion
in
your
own
breast
.
It
is
not
the
least
to
*NL*
the
purpose
what
the
reasons
of
this
prohibition
are
;
they
may
be
the
*NL*
strongest
and
gravest
reasons
,
or
they
may
be
mere
whim
.
This
is
not
for
*NL*
you
to
inquire
into
.
The
condition
is
laid
down
.
Your
acceptance
of
it
,
*NL*
and
your
observance
of
it
as
binding
,
is
the
only
remaining
condition
*NL*
that
I
am
charged
with
,
by
the
person
from
whom
I
take
my
instructions
,
*NL*
and
for
whom
I
am
not
otherwise
responsible
.
That
person
is
the
person
*NL*
from
whom
you
derive
your
expectations
,
and
the
secret
is
solely
held
by
*NL*
that
person
and
by
me
.
Again
,
not
a
very
difficult
condition
with
which
*NL*
to
encumber
such
a
rise
in
fortune
;
but
if
you
have
any
objection
to
it
,
*NL*
this
is
the
time
to
mention
it
.
Speak
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
,
I
stammered
with
difficulty
that
I
had
no
objection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
not
!
Now
,
Mr.
Pip
,
I
have
done
with
stipulations
.
''
*NL*
Though
he
called
me
Mr.
Pip
,
and
began
rather
to
make
up
to
me
,
he
still
*NL*
could
not
get
rid
of
a
certain
air
of
bullying
suspicion
;
and
even
now
*NL*
he
occasionally
shut
his
eyes
and
threw
his
finger
at
me
while
he
*NL*
spoke
,
as
much
as
to
express
that
he
knew
all
kinds
of
things
to
my
*NL*
disparagement
,
if
he
only
chose
to
mention
them
.
``
We
come
next
,
to
mere
*NL*
details
of
arrangement
.
You
must
know
that
,
although
I
have
used
*NL*
the
term
`
expectations
'
more
than
once
,
you
are
not
endowed
with
*NL*
expectations
only
.
There
is
already
lodged
in
my
hands
a
sum
of
money
*NL*
amply
sufficient
for
your
suitable
education
and
maintenance
.
You
will
*NL*
please
consider
me
your
guardian
.
Oh
!
''
for
I
was
going
to
thank
him
,
``
I
*NL*
tell
you
at
once
,
I
am
paid
for
my
services
,
or
I
should
n't
render
them
.
*NL*
It
is
considered
that
you
must
be
better
educated
,
in
accordance
with
*NL*
your
altered
position
,
and
that
you
will
be
alive
to
the
importance
and
*NL*
necessity
of
at
once
entering
on
that
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
had
always
longed
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
what
you
have
always
longed
for
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
he
retorted
;
*NL*
``
keep
to
the
record
.
If
you
long
for
it
now
,
that
's
enough
.
Am
I
*NL*
answered
that
you
are
ready
to
be
placed
at
once
under
some
proper
*NL*
tutor
?
Is
that
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stammered
yes
,
that
was
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
.
Now
,
your
inclinations
are
to
be
consulted
.
I
do
n't
think
that
*NL*
wise

mind
,
but
it
's
my
trust
.
Have
you
ever
heard
of
any
tutor
whom
you
*NL*
would
prefer
to
another
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
heard
of
any
tutor
but
Biddy
and
Mr.
Wopsle
's
great-aunt
;
*NL*
so
,
I
replied
in
the
negative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
certain
tutor

I
have
some
knowledge

said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
I
do
n't
recommend
him
,
*NL*
observe
;
because
I
never
recommend
anybody

The
gentleman
I

is
*NL*
one
Mr.
Matthew
Pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
!
I
caught
at
the
name
directly
.
Miss
Havisham
's
relation
.
The
Matthew
*NL*
whom
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Camilla
had
spoken
of
.
The
Matthew
whose
place
was
to
*NL*
be
at
Miss
Havisham
's
head
,
when
she
lay
dead
,
in
her
bride
's
dress
on
*NL*
the
bride
's
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
name

said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
looking
shrewdly
at
me
,
and
then
*NL*
shutting
up
his
eyes
while
he
waited
for
my
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
answer
was
,
that
I
had
heard
of
the
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
he
.
``
You
have
heard
of
the
name

But
the
question
is
,
what
do
*NL*
you
say
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
or
tried
to
say
,
that
I
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
*NL*
recommendation
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my
young
friend

''
he
interrupted
,
shaking
his
great
head
very
*NL*
slowly
.
``
Recollect
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
recollecting
myself
,
I
began
again
that
I
was
much
obliged
to
him
*NL*
for
his
recommendation
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my
young

he
interrupted
,
shaking
his
head

frowning
and
*NL*
smiling
both
at
once
,

``
no

no

no

very
well
done

n't

Recommendation
is
not
the
word

*NL*
Mr.
Pip

Try
another

*NL*
*NL*
Correcting
myself
,
I
said
that
I
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
mention
*NL*
of
Mr.
Matthew
Pocket

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Mr.

And
-LRB-
I
added
-RRB-
,
I
would
*NL*
gladly
try
that
gentleman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

You
had
better

The

prepared

you
can
see
his

who
is
in
London

When

will
you
come
to
London
?

*NL*
*NL*
I
said
-LRB-
glancing
at
Joe
,
who
stood
looking
on
,
motionless
-RRB-
,
that
I
*NL*
supposed
I
could
come
directly

*NL*
*NL*
``
First

said
Mr.

,
``
you
should
have
some
new

You
'll
want

some
money

Shall
I
leave
you
twenty
guineas

*NL*
*NL*
He
produced
a
long
purse
,
with
the
greatest
coolness
,
and
counted
them
*NL*
out
on
the
table
and
pushed
them
over
to
me
.
This
was
the
first
time
he
*NL*
had
taken
his
leg
from
the
chair
.
He
sat
astride
of
the
chair
when
he
*NL*
had
pushed
the
money
over
,
and
sat
swinging
his
purse
and
eyeing
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Joseph
Gargery
?
You
look
dumbfoundered
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
!
''
said
Joe
,
in
a
very
decided
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
understood
that
you
wanted
nothing
for
yourself
,
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
were
understood
,
''
said
Joe
.
``
And
it
are
understood
.
And
it
ever
will
*NL*
be
similar
according
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
swinging
his
purse
,
--
``
what
if
it
was
in
my
*NL*
instructions
to
make
you
a
present
,
as
compensation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
compensation
what
for
?
''
Joe
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
loss
of
his
services
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
with
the
touch
of
a
woman
.
I
have
*NL*
often
thought
him
since
,
like
the
steam-hammer
that
can
crush
a
man
or
*NL*
pat
an
egg-shell
,
in
his
combination
of
strength
with
gentleness
.
``
Pip
*NL*
is
that
hearty
welcome
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
to
go
free
with
his
services
,
to
*NL*
honor
and
fortun
'
,
as
no
words
can
tell
him
.
But
if
you
think
as
Money
*NL*
can
make
compensation
to
me
for
the
loss
of
the
little
child
--
what
come
*NL*
to
the
forge
--
and
ever
the
best
of
friends
!
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
O
dear
good
Joe
,
whom
I
was
so
ready
to
leave
and
so
unthankful
to
,
I
*NL*
see
you
again
,
with
your
muscular
blacksmith
's
arm
before
your
eyes
,
*NL*
and
your
broad
chest
heaving
,
and
your
voice
dying
away
.
O
dear
good
*NL*
faithful
tender
Joe
,
I
feel
the
loving
tremble
of
your
hand
upon
my
arm
,
*NL*
as
solemnly
this
day
as
if
it
had
been
the
rustle
of
an
angel
's
wing
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
encouraged
Joe
at
the
time
.
I
was
lost
in
the
mazes
of
my
future
*NL*
fortunes
,
and
could
not
retrace
the
by-paths
we
had
trodden
together
.
I
*NL*
begged
Joe
to
be
comforted
,
for
-LRB-
as
he
said
-RRB-
we
had
ever
been
the
best
*NL*
of
friends
,
and
-LRB-
as
I
said
-RRB-
we
ever
would
be
so
.
Joe
scooped
his
eyes
*NL*
with
his
disengaged
wrist
,
as
if
he
were
bent
on
gouging
himself
,
but
*NL*
said
not
another
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
had
looked
on
at
this
,
as
one
who
recognized
in
Joe
the
*NL*
village
idiot
,
and
in
me
his
keeper
.
When
it
was
over
,
he
said
,
weighing
*NL*
in
his
hand
the
purse
he
had
ceased
to
swing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Joseph
Gargery
,
I
warn
you
this
is
your
last
chance
.
No
half
*NL*
measures
with
me
.
If
you
mean
to
take
a
present
that
I
have
it
in
charge
*NL*
to
make
you
,
speak
out
,
and
you
shall
have
it
.
If
on
the
contrary
you
*NL*
mean
to
say
--
''
Here
,
to
his
great
amazement
,
he
was
stopped
by
Joe
's
*NL*
suddenly
working
round
him
with
every
demonstration
of
a
fell
pugilistic
*NL*
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
I
meantersay
,
''
cried
Joe
,
``
that
if
you
come
into
my
place
*NL*
bull-baiting
and
badgering
me
,
come
out
!
Which
I
meantersay
as
sech
if
*NL*
you
're
a
man
,
come
on
!
Which
I
meantersay
that
what
I
say
,
I
meantersay
*NL*
and
stand
or
fall
by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
drew
Joe
away
,
and
he
immediately
became
placable
;
merely
stating
to
*NL*
me
,
in
an
obliging
manner
and
as
a
polite
expostulatory
notice
to
any
*NL*
one
whom
it
might
happen
to
concern
,
that
he
were
not
a
going
to
be
*NL*
bull-baited
and
badgered
in
his
own
place
.
Mr.
Jaggers
had
risen
when
*NL*
Joe
demonstrated
,
and
had
backed
near
the
door
.
Without
evincing
*NL*
any
inclination
to
come
in
again
,
he
there
delivered
his
valedictory
*NL*
remarks
.
They
were
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Pip
,
I
think
the
sooner
you
leave
here
--
as
you
are
to
be
a
*NL*
gentleman
--
the
better
.
Let
it
stand
for
this
day
week
,
and
you
shall
*NL*
receive
my
printed
address
in
the
meantime
.
You
can
take
a
hackney-coach
*NL*
at
the
stage-coach
office
in
London
,
and
come
straight
to
me
.
*NL*
Understand
,
that
I
express
no
opinion
,
one
way
or
other
,
on
the
trust
*NL*
I
undertake
.
I
am
paid
for
undertaking
it
,
and
I
do
so
.
Now
,
understand
*NL*
that
,
finally
.
Understand
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
throwing
his
finger
at
both
of
us
,
and
I
think
would
have
gone
*NL*
on
,
but
for
his
seeming
to
think
Joe
dangerous
,
and
going
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
came
into
my
head
which
induced
me
to
run
after
him
,
as
he
was
*NL*
going
down
to
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
where
he
had
left
a
hired
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Jaggers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
''
said
he
,
facing
round
,
``
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
be
quite
right
,
Mr.
Jaggers
,
and
to
keep
to
your
directions
;
*NL*
so
I
thought
I
had
better
ask
.
Would
there
be
any
objection
to
my
taking
*NL*
leave
of
any
one
I
know
,
about
here
,
before
I
go
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
looking
as
if
he
hardly
understood
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
in
the
village
only
,
but
up
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
.
``
No
objection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
and
ran
home
again
,
and
there
I
found
that
Joe
had
already
*NL*
locked
the
front
door
and
vacated
the
state
parlor
,
and
was
seated
*NL*
by
the
kitchen
fire
with
a
hand
on
each
knee
,
gazing
intently
at
the
*NL*
burning
coals
.
I
too
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
gazed
at
the
coals
,
*NL*
and
nothing
was
said
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
sister
was
in
her
cushioned
chair
in
her
corner
,
and
Biddy
sat
at
her
*NL*
needle-work
before
the
fire
,
and
Joe
sat
next
Biddy
,
and
I
sat
next
Joe
*NL*
in
the
corner
opposite
my
sister
.
The
more
I
looked
into
the
glowing
*NL*
coals
,
the
more
incapable
I
became
of
looking
at
Joe
;
the
longer
the
*NL*
silence
lasted
,
the
more
unable
I
felt
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
I
got
out
,
``
Joe
,
have
you
told
Biddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Pip
,
''
returned
Joe
,
still
looking
at
the
fire
,
and
holding
his
*NL*
knees
tight
,
as
if
he
had
private
information
that
they
intended
to
make
*NL*
off
somewhere
,
``
which
I
left
it
to
yourself
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
you
told
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
's
a
gentleman
of
fortun
'
then
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
and
God
bless
him
in
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
dropped
her
work
,
and
looked
at
me
.
Joe
held
his
knees
and
looked
*NL*
at
me
.
I
looked
at
both
of
them
.
After
a
pause
,
they
both
heartily
*NL*
congratulated
me
;
but
there
was
a
certain
touch
of
sadness
in
their
*NL*
congratulations
that
I
rather
resented
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
it
upon
myself
to
impress
Biddy
-LRB-
and
through
Biddy
,
Joe
-RRB-
with
the
*NL*
grave
obligation
I
considered
my
friends
under
,
to
know
nothing
and
say
*NL*
nothing
about
the
maker
of
my
fortune
.
It
would
all
come
out
in
good
*NL*
time
,
I
observed
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
nothing
was
to
be
said
,
save
*NL*
that
I
had
come
into
great
expectations
from
a
mysterious
patron
.
Biddy
*NL*
nodded
her
head
thoughtfully
at
the
fire
as
she
took
up
her
work
again
,
*NL*
and
said
she
would
be
very
particular
;
and
Joe
,
still
detaining
his
*NL*
knees
,
said
,
``
Ay
,
ay
,
I
'll
be
ekervally
partickler
,
Pip
;
''
and
then
they
*NL*
congratulated
me
again
,
and
went
on
to
express
so
much
wonder
at
the
*NL*
notion
of
my
being
a
gentleman
that
I
did
n't
half
like
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Infinite
pains
were
then
taken
by
Biddy
to
convey
to
my
sister
some
idea
*NL*
of
what
had
happened
.
To
the
best
of
my
belief
,
those
efforts
entirely
*NL*
failed
.
She
laughed
and
nodded
her
head
a
great
many
times
,
and
even
*NL*
repeated
after
Biddy
,
the
words
``
Pip
''
and
``
Property
.
''
But
I
doubt
if
*NL*
they
had
more
meaning
in
them
than
an
election
cry
,
and
I
can
not
suggest
*NL*
a
darker
picture
of
her
state
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
could
have
believed
it
without
experience
,
but
as
Joe
and
*NL*
Biddy
became
more
at
their
cheerful
ease
again
,
I
became
quite
gloomy
.
*NL*
Dissatisfied
with
my
fortune
,
of
course
I
could
not
be
;
but
it
is
*NL*
possible
that
I
may
have
been
,
without
quite
knowing
it
,
dissatisfied
*NL*
with
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
how
,
I
sat
with
my
elbow
on
my
knee
and
my
face
upon
my
hand
,
*NL*
looking
into
the
fire
,
as
those
two
talked
about
my
going
away
,
and
*NL*
about
what
they
should
do
without
me
,
and
all
that
.
And
whenever
I
*NL*
caught
one
of
them
looking
at
me
,
though
never
so
pleasantly
-LRB-
and
they
*NL*
often
looked
at
me
,
--
particularly
Biddy
-RRB-
,
I
felt
offended
:
as
if
they
*NL*
were
expressing
some
mistrust
of
me
.
Though
Heaven
knows
they
never
did
*NL*
by
word
or
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
those
times
I
would
get
up
and
look
out
at
the
door
;
for
our
kitchen
*NL*
door
opened
at
once
upon
the
night
,
and
stood
open
on
summer
evenings
to
*NL*
air
the
room
.
The
very
stars
to
which
I
then
raised
my
eyes
,
I
am
afraid
*NL*
I
took
to
be
but
poor
and
humble
stars
for
glittering
on
the
rustic
*NL*
objects
among
which
I
had
passed
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saturday
night
,
''
said
I
,
when
we
sat
at
our
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
*NL*
and
beer
.
``
Five
more
days
,
and
then
the
day
before
the
day
!
They
'll
soon
*NL*
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Pip
,
''
observed
Joe
,
whose
voice
sounded
hollow
in
his
beer-mug
.
*NL*
``
They
'll
soon
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
,
soon
go
,
''
said
Biddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
,
Joe
,
that
when
I
go
down
town
on
Monday
,
and
*NL*
order
my
new
clothes
,
I
shall
tell
the
tailor
that
I
'll
come
and
put
*NL*
them
on
there
,
or
that
I
'll
have
them
sent
to
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
.
It
*NL*
would
be
very
disagreeable
to
be
stared
at
by
all
the
people
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hubble
might
like
to
see
you
in
your
new
gen-teel
figure
*NL*
too
,
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
,
industriously
cutting
his
bread
,
with
his
cheese
on
*NL*
it
,
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
,
and
glancing
at
my
untasted
supper
*NL*
as
if
he
thought
of
the
time
when
we
used
to
compare
slices
.
``
So
might
*NL*
Wopsle
.
And
the
Jolly
Bargemen
might
take
it
as
a
compliment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
do
n't
want
,
Joe
.
They
would
make
such
a
business
of
*NL*
it
,
--
such
a
coarse
and
common
business
,
--
that
I
could
n't
bear
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
indeed
,
Pip
!
''
said
Joe
.
``
If
you
could
n't
abear
yourself
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
asked
me
here
,
as
she
sat
holding
my
sister
's
plate
,
``
Have
you
*NL*
thought
about
when
you
'll
show
yourself
to
Mr.
Gargery
,
and
your
sister
*NL*
and
me
?
You
will
show
yourself
to
us
;
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
I
returned
with
some
resentment
,
``
you
are
so
exceedingly
quick
*NL*
that
it
's
difficult
to
keep
up
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
She
always
were
quick
,
''
observed
Joe
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
waited
another
moment
,
Biddy
,
you
would
have
heard
me
say
*NL*
that
I
shall
bring
my
clothes
here
in
a
bundle
one
evening
,
--
most
likely
*NL*
on
the
evening
before
I
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
said
no
more
.
Handsomely
forgiving
her
,
I
soon
exchanged
an
*NL*
affectionate
good
night
with
her
and
Joe
,
and
went
up
to
bed
.
When
I
got
*NL*
into
my
little
room
,
I
sat
down
and
took
a
long
look
at
it
,
as
a
mean
*NL*
little
room
that
I
should
soon
be
parted
from
and
raised
above
,
for
*NL*
ever
.
It
was
furnished
with
fresh
young
remembrances
too
,
and
even
at
*NL*
the
same
moment
I
fell
into
much
the
same
confused
division
of
mind
*NL*
between
it
and
the
better
rooms
to
which
I
was
going
,
as
I
had
been
in
*NL*
so
often
between
the
forge
and
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
Biddy
and
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
been
shining
brightly
all
day
on
the
roof
of
my
attic
,
and
*NL*
the
room
was
warm
.
As
I
put
the
window
open
and
stood
looking
out
,
I
saw
*NL*
Joe
come
slowly
forth
at
the
dark
door
,
below
,
and
take
a
turn
or
two
*NL*
in
the
air
;
and
then
I
saw
Biddy
come
,
and
bring
him
a
pipe
and
light
*NL*
it
for
him
.
He
never
smoked
so
late
,
and
it
seemed
to
hint
to
me
that
he
*NL*
wanted
comforting
,
for
some
reason
or
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
presently
stood
at
the
door
immediately
beneath
me
,
smoking
his
pipe
,
*NL*
and
Biddy
stood
there
too
,
quietly
talking
to
him
,
and
I
knew
that
they
*NL*
talked
of
me
,
for
I
heard
my
name
mentioned
in
an
endearing
tone
by
both
*NL*
of
them
more
than
once
.
I
would
not
have
listened
for
more
,
if
I
could
*NL*
have
heard
more
;
so
I
drew
away
from
the
window
,
and
sat
down
in
my
one
*NL*
chair
by
the
bedside
,
feeling
it
very
sorrowful
and
strange
that
this
*NL*
first
night
of
my
bright
fortunes
should
be
the
loneliest
I
had
ever
*NL*
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
towards
the
open
window
,
I
saw
light
wreaths
from
Joe
's
pipe
*NL*
floating
there
,
and
I
fancied
it
was
like
a
blessing
from
Joe
,
--
not
*NL*
obtruded
on
me
or
paraded
before
me
,
but
pervading
the
air
we
shared
*NL*
together
.
I
put
my
light
out
,
and
crept
into
bed
;
and
it
was
an
uneasy
*NL*
bed
now
,
and
I
never
slept
the
old
sound
sleep
in
it
any
more
.

Chapter
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
made
a
considerable
difference
in
my
general
prospect
of
Life
,
*NL*
and
brightened
it
so
much
that
it
scarcely
seemed
the
same
.
What
lay
*NL*
heaviest
on
my
mind
was
,
the
consideration
that
six
days
intervened
*NL*
between
me
and
the
day
of
departure
;
for
I
could
not
divest
myself
of
*NL*
a
misgiving
that
something
might
happen
to
London
in
the
meanwhile
,
and
*NL*
that
,
when
I
got
there
,
it
would
be
either
greatly
deteriorated
or
clean
*NL*
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
and
Biddy
were
very
sympathetic
and
pleasant
when
I
spoke
of
our
*NL*
approaching
separation
;
but
they
only
referred
to
it
when
I
did
.
After
*NL*
breakfast
,
Joe
brought
out
my
indentures
from
the
press
in
the
best
*NL*
parlor
,
and
we
put
them
in
the
fire
,
and
I
felt
that
I
was
free
.
With
*NL*
all
the
novelty
of
my
emancipation
on
me
,
I
went
to
church
with
Joe
,
and
*NL*
thought
perhaps
the
clergyman
would
n't
have
read
that
about
the
rich
man
*NL*
and
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
,
if
he
had
known
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
our
early
dinner
,
I
strolled
out
alone
,
purposing
to
finish
off
*NL*
the
marshes
at
once
,
and
get
them
done
with
.
As
I
passed
the
church
,
I
*NL*
felt
-LRB-
as
I
had
felt
during
service
in
the
morning
-RRB-
a
sublime
compassion
*NL*
for
the
poor
creatures
who
were
destined
to
go
there
,
Sunday
after
*NL*
Sunday
,
all
their
lives
through
,
and
to
lie
obscurely
at
last
among
the
*NL*
low
green
mounds
.
I
promised
myself
that
I
would
do
something
for
them
*NL*
one
of
these
days
,
and
formed
a
plan
in
outline
for
bestowing
a
*NL*
dinner
of
roast-beef
and
plum-pudding
,
a
pint
of
ale
,
and
a
gallon
of
*NL*
condescension
,
upon
everybody
in
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
had
often
thought
before
,
with
something
allied
to
shame
,
of
my
*NL*
companionship
with
the
fugitive
whom
I
had
once
seen
limping
among
those
*NL*
graves
,
what
were
my
thoughts
on
this
Sunday
,
when
the
place
recalled
*NL*
the
wretch
,
ragged
and
shivering
,
with
his
felon
iron
and
badge
!
My
*NL*
comfort
was
,
that
it
happened
a
long
time
ago
,
and
that
he
had
doubtless
*NL*
been
transported
a
long
way
off
,
and
that
he
was
dead
to
me
,
and
might
*NL*
be
veritably
dead
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
more
low
,
wet
grounds
,
no
more
dikes
and
sluices
,
no
more
of
these
*NL*
grazing
cattle
,
--
though
they
seemed
,
in
their
dull
manner
,
to
wear
a
*NL*
more
respectful
air
now
,
and
to
face
round
,
in
order
that
they
*NL*
might
stare
as
long
as
possible
at
the
possessor
of
such
great
*NL*
expectations
,
--
farewell
,
monotonous
acquaintances
of
my
childhood
,
*NL*
henceforth
I
was
for
London
and
greatness
;
not
for
smith
's
work
in
*NL*
general
,
and
for
you
!
I
made
my
exultant
way
to
the
old
Battery
,
and
,
*NL*
lying
down
there
to
consider
the
question
whether
Miss
Havisham
intended
*NL*
me
for
Estella
,
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
awoke
,
I
was
much
surprised
to
find
Joe
sitting
beside
me
,
*NL*
smoking
his
pipe
.
He
greeted
me
with
a
cheerful
smile
on
my
opening
my
*NL*
eyes
,
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
being
the
last
time
,
Pip
,
I
thought
I
'd
foller
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Joe
,
I
am
very
glad
you
did
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
sure
,
dear
Joe
,
''
I
went
on
,
after
we
had
shaken
hands
,
``
that
*NL*
I
shall
never
forget
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Pip
!
''
said
Joe
,
in
a
comfortable
tone
,
``
I
'm
sure
of
that
.
Ay
,
*NL*
ay
,
old
chap
!
Bless
you
,
it
were
only
necessary
to
get
it
well
round
in
*NL*
a
man
's
mind
,
to
be
certain
on
it
.
But
it
took
a
bit
of
time
to
get
it
*NL*
well
round
,
the
change
come
so
oncommon
plump
;
did
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
,
I
was
not
best
pleased
with
Joe
's
being
so
mightily
secure
of
*NL*
me
.
I
should
have
liked
him
to
have
betrayed
emotion
,
or
to
have
said
,
*NL*
``
It
does
you
credit
,
Pip
,
''
or
something
of
that
sort
.
Therefore
,
I
made
*NL*
no
remark
on
Joe
's
first
head
;
merely
saying
as
to
his
second
,
that
the
*NL*
tidings
had
indeed
come
suddenly
,
but
that
I
had
always
wanted
to
be
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
had
often
and
often
speculated
on
what
I
would
do
,
if
I
*NL*
were
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
though
?
''
said
Joe
.
``
Astonishing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
now
,
Joe
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
you
did
not
get
on
a
little
more
,
*NL*
when
we
had
our
lessons
here
;
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
returned
Joe
.
``
I
'm
so
awful
dull
.
I
'm
only
master
*NL*
of
my
own
trade
.
It
were
always
a
pity
as
I
was
so
awful
dull
;
but
it
's
*NL*
no
more
of
a
pity
now
,
than
it
was
--
this
day
twelvemonth
--
do
n't
you
*NL*
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
had
meant
was
,
that
when
I
came
into
my
property
and
was
able
to
*NL*
do
something
for
Joe
,
it
would
have
been
much
more
agreeable
if
he
*NL*
had
been
better
qualified
for
a
rise
in
station
.
He
was
so
perfectly
*NL*
innocent
of
my
meaning
,
however
,
that
I
thought
I
would
mention
it
to
*NL*
Biddy
in
preference
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
when
we
had
walked
home
and
had
had
tea
,
I
took
Biddy
into
our
*NL*
little
garden
by
the
side
of
the
lane
,
and
,
after
throwing
out
in
a
*NL*
general
way
for
the
elevation
of
her
spirits
,
that
I
should
never
forget
*NL*
her
,
said
I
had
a
favor
to
ask
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
is
,
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
you
will
not
omit
any
opportunity
of
*NL*
helping
Joe
on
,
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
helping
him
on
?
''
asked
Biddy
,
with
a
steady
sort
of
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
Joe
is
a
dear
good
fellow
,
--
in
fact
,
I
think
he
is
the
dearest
*NL*
fellow
that
ever
lived
,
--
but
he
is
rather
backward
in
some
things
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
Biddy
,
in
his
learning
and
his
manners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
was
looking
at
Biddy
as
I
spoke
,
and
although
she
opened
her
*NL*
eyes
very
wide
when
I
had
spoken
,
she
did
not
look
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
his
manners
!
wo
n't
his
manners
do
then
?
''
asked
Biddy
,
plucking
a
*NL*
black-currant
leaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Biddy
,
they
do
very
well
here
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
they
do
very
well
here
?
''
interrupted
Biddy
,
looking
closely
at
the
*NL*
leaf
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
me
out
,
--
but
if
I
were
to
remove
Joe
into
a
higher
sphere
,
as
I
*NL*
shall
hope
to
remove
him
when
I
fully
come
into
my
property
,
they
would
*NL*
hardly
do
him
justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
think
he
knows
that
?
''
asked
Biddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
such
a
very
provoking
question
-LRB-
for
it
had
never
in
the
most
*NL*
distant
manner
occurred
to
me
-RRB-
,
that
I
said
,
snappishly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
,
having
rubbed
the
leaf
to
pieces
between
her
hands
,
--
and
the
*NL*
smell
of
a
black-currant
bush
has
ever
since
recalled
to
me
that
evening
*NL*
in
the
little
garden
by
the
side
of
the
lane
,
--
said
,
``
Have
you
never
*NL*
considered
that
he
may
be
proud
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proud
?
''
I
repeated
,
with
disdainful
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
there
are
many
kinds
of
pride
,
''
said
Biddy
,
looking
full
at
me
and
*NL*
shaking
her
head
;
``
pride
is
not
all
of
one
kind
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
What
are
you
stopping
for
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
all
of
one
kind
,
''
resumed
Biddy
.
``
He
may
be
too
proud
to
let
any
*NL*
one
take
him
out
of
a
place
that
he
is
competent
to
fill
,
and
fills
well
*NL*
and
with
respect
.
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
think
he
is
;
though
it
sounds
*NL*
bold
in
me
to
say
so
,
for
you
must
know
him
far
better
than
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
very
sorry
to
see
this
in
you
.
I
did
not
*NL*
expect
to
see
this
in
you
.
You
are
envious
,
Biddy
,
and
grudging
.
You
*NL*
are
dissatisfied
on
account
of
my
rise
in
fortune
,
and
you
ca
n't
help
*NL*
showing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
the
heart
to
think
so
,
''
returned
Biddy
,
``
say
so
.
Say
so
*NL*
over
and
over
again
,
if
you
have
the
heart
to
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
the
heart
to
be
so
,
you
mean
,
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
in
a
virtuous
*NL*
and
superior
tone
;
``
do
n't
put
it
off
upon
me
.
I
am
very
sorry
to
see
it
,
*NL*
and
it
's
a
--
it
's
a
bad
side
of
human
nature
.
I
did
intend
to
ask
you
*NL*
to
use
any
little
opportunities
you
might
have
after
I
was
gone
,
of
*NL*
improving
dear
Joe
.
But
after
this
I
ask
you
nothing
.
I
am
extremely
*NL*
sorry
to
see
this
in
you
,
Biddy
,
''
I
repeated
.
``
It
's
a
--
it
's
a
bad
side
*NL*
of
human
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
you
scold
me
or
approve
of
me
,
''
returned
poor
Biddy
,
``
you
may
*NL*
equally
depend
upon
my
trying
to
do
all
that
lies
in
my
power
,
here
,
*NL*
at
all
times
.
And
whatever
opinion
you
take
away
of
me
,
shall
make
*NL*
no
difference
in
my
remembrance
of
you
.
Yet
a
gentleman
should
not
be
*NL*
unjust
neither
,
''
said
Biddy
,
turning
away
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
again
warmly
repeated
that
it
was
a
bad
side
of
human
nature
-LRB-
in
which
*NL*
sentiment
,
waiving
its
application
,
I
have
since
seen
reason
to
think
I
*NL*
was
right
-RRB-
,
and
I
walked
down
the
little
path
away
from
Biddy
,
and
*NL*
Biddy
went
into
the
house
,
and
I
went
out
at
the
garden
gate
and
took
a
*NL*
dejected
stroll
until
supper-time
;
again
feeling
it
very
sorrowful
and
*NL*
strange
that
this
,
the
second
night
of
my
bright
fortunes
,
should
be
as
*NL*
lonely
and
unsatisfactory
as
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
morning
once
more
brightened
my
view
,
and
I
extended
my
clemency
to
*NL*
Biddy
,
and
we
dropped
the
subject
.
Putting
on
the
best
clothes
I
had
,
*NL*
I
went
into
town
as
early
as
I
could
hope
to
find
the
shops
open
,
*NL*
and
presented
myself
before
Mr.
Trabb
,
the
tailor
,
who
was
having
his
*NL*
breakfast
in
the
parlor
behind
his
shop
,
and
who
did
not
think
it
worth
*NL*
his
while
to
come
out
to
me
,
but
called
me
in
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Mr.
Trabb
,
in
a
hail-fellow-well-met
kind
of
way
.
``
How
are
*NL*
you
,
and
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Trabb
had
sliced
his
hot
roll
into
three
feather-beds
,
and
was
*NL*
slipping
butter
in
between
the
blankets
,
and
covering
it
up
.
He
was
a
*NL*
prosperous
old
bachelor
,
and
his
open
window
looked
into
a
prosperous
*NL*
little
garden
and
orchard
,
and
there
was
a
prosperous
iron
safe
let
into
*NL*
the
wall
at
the
side
of
his
fireplace
,
and
I
did
not
doubt
that
heaps
of
*NL*
his
prosperity
were
put
away
in
it
in
bags
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Trabb
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
's
an
unpleasant
thing
to
have
to
mention
,
*NL*
because
it
looks
like
boasting
;
but
I
have
come
into
a
handsome
*NL*
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
change
passed
over
Mr.
Trabb
.
He
forgot
the
butter
in
bed
,
got
up
from
*NL*
the
bedside
,
and
wiped
his
fingers
on
the
tablecloth
,
exclaiming
,
``
Lord
*NL*
bless
my
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
up
to
my
guardian
in
London
,
''
said
I
,
casually
drawing
some
*NL*
guineas
out
of
my
pocket
and
looking
at
them
;
``
and
I
want
a
fashionable
*NL*
suit
of
clothes
to
go
in
.
I
wish
to
pay
for
them
,
''
I
added
--
otherwise
I
*NL*
thought
he
might
only
pretend
to
make
them
,
``
with
ready
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Trabb
,
as
he
respectfully
bent
his
body
,
opened
*NL*
his
arms
,
and
took
the
liberty
of
touching
me
on
the
outside
of
each
*NL*
elbow
,
``
do
n't
hurt
me
by
mentioning
that
.
May
I
venture
to
congratulate
*NL*
you
?
Would
you
do
me
the
favor
of
stepping
into
the
shop
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Trabb
's
boy
was
the
most
audacious
boy
in
all
that
country-side
.
*NL*
When
I
had
entered
he
was
sweeping
the
shop
,
and
he
had
sweetened
his
*NL*
labors
by
sweeping
over
me
.
He
was
still
sweeping
when
I
came
out
into
*NL*
the
shop
with
Mr.
Trabb
,
and
he
knocked
the
broom
against
all
possible
*NL*
corners
and
obstacles
,
to
express
-LRB-
as
I
understood
it
-RRB-
equality
with
any
*NL*
blacksmith
,
alive
or
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
that
noise
,
''
said
Mr.
Trabb
,
with
the
greatest
sternness
,
``
or
I
'll
*NL*
knock
your
head
off
!
--
Do
me
the
favor
to
be
seated
,
sir
.
Now
,
this
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Trabb
,
taking
down
a
roll
of
cloth
,
and
tiding
it
out
in
a
*NL*
flowing
manner
over
the
counter
,
preparatory
to
getting
his
hand
under
*NL*
it
to
show
the
gloss
,
``
is
a
very
sweet
article
.
I
can
recommend
it
for
*NL*
your
purpose
,
sir
,
because
it
really
is
extra
super
.
But
you
shall
*NL*
see
some
others
.
Give
me
Number
Four
,
you
!
''
-LRB-
To
the
boy
,
and
with
a
*NL*
dreadfully
severe
stare
;
foreseeing
the
danger
of
that
miscreant
's
*NL*
brushing
me
with
it
,
or
making
some
other
sign
of
familiarity
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Trabb
never
removed
his
stern
eye
from
the
boy
until
he
had
*NL*
deposited
number
four
on
the
counter
and
was
at
a
safe
distance
again
.
*NL*
Then
he
commanded
him
to
bring
number
five
,
and
number
eight
.
``
And
let
*NL*
me
have
none
of
your
tricks
here
,
''
said
Mr.
Trabb
,
``
or
you
shall
repent
*NL*
it
,
you
young
scoundrel
,
the
longest
day
you
have
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Trabb
then
bent
over
number
four
,
and
in
a
sort
of
deferential
*NL*
confidence
recommended
it
to
me
as
a
light
article
for
summer
wear
,
an
*NL*
article
much
in
vogue
among
the
nobility
and
gentry
,
an
article
that
*NL*
it
would
ever
be
an
honor
to
him
to
reflect
upon
a
distinguished
*NL*
fellow-townsman
's
-LRB-
if
he
might
claim
me
for
a
fellow-townsman
-RRB-
having
*NL*
worn
.
``
Are
you
bringing
numbers
five
and
eight
,
you
vagabond
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Trabb
to
the
boy
after
that
,
``
or
shall
I
kick
you
out
of
the
shop
and
*NL*
bring
them
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
selected
the
materials
for
a
suit
,
with
the
assistance
of
Mr.
Trabb
's
*NL*
judgment
,
and
re-entered
the
parlor
to
be
measured
.
For
although
Mr.
*NL*
Trabb
had
my
measure
already
,
and
had
previously
been
quite
contented
*NL*
with
it
,
he
said
apologetically
that
it
``
would
n't
do
under
existing
*NL*
circumstances
,
sir
,
--
would
n't
do
at
all
.
''
So
,
Mr.
Trabb
measured
and
*NL*
calculated
me
in
the
parlor
,
as
if
I
were
an
estate
and
he
the
finest
*NL*
species
of
surveyor
,
and
gave
himself
such
a
world
of
trouble
that
*NL*
I
felt
that
no
suit
of
clothes
could
possibly
remunerate
him
for
his
*NL*
pains
.
When
he
had
at
last
done
and
had
appointed
to
send
the
articles
*NL*
to
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
on
the
Thursday
evening
,
he
said
,
with
his
hand
*NL*
upon
the
parlor
lock
,
``
I
know
,
sir
,
that
London
gentlemen
can
not
be
*NL*
expected
to
patronize
local
work
,
as
a
rule
;
but
if
you
would
give
me
a
*NL*
turn
now
and
then
in
the
quality
of
a
townsman
,
I
should
greatly
esteem
*NL*
it
.
Good
morning
,
sir
,
much
obliged
.
--
Door
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
word
was
flung
at
the
boy
,
who
had
not
the
least
notion
what
*NL*
it
meant
.
But
I
saw
him
collapse
as
his
master
rubbed
me
out
with
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
my
first
decided
experience
of
the
stupendous
power
of
money
*NL*
was
,
that
it
had
morally
laid
upon
his
back
Trabb
's
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
memorable
event
,
I
went
to
the
hatter
's
,
and
the
bootmaker
's
,
*NL*
and
the
hosier
's
,
and
felt
rather
like
Mother
Hubbard
's
dog
whose
outfit
*NL*
required
the
services
of
so
many
trades
.
I
also
went
to
the
coach-office
*NL*
and
took
my
place
for
seven
o'clock
on
Saturday
morning
.
It
was
*NL*
not
necessary
to
explain
everywhere
that
I
had
come
into
a
handsome
*NL*
property
;
but
whenever
I
said
anything
to
that
effect
,
it
followed
that
*NL*
the
officiating
tradesman
ceased
to
have
his
attention
diverted
through
*NL*
the
window
by
the
High
Street
,
and
concentrated
his
mind
upon
me
.
When
*NL*
I
had
ordered
everything
I
wanted
,
I
directed
my
steps
towards
*NL*
Pumblechook
's
,
and
,
as
I
approached
that
gentleman
's
place
of
business
,
*NL*
I
saw
him
standing
at
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
waiting
for
me
with
great
impatience
.
He
had
been
out
early
with
*NL*
the
chaise-cart
,
and
had
called
at
the
forge
and
heard
the
news
.
He
had
*NL*
prepared
a
collation
for
me
in
the
Barnwell
parlor
,
and
he
too
ordered
*NL*
his
shopman
to
``
come
out
of
the
gangway
''
as
my
sacred
person
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
taking
me
by
both
hands
,
when
*NL*
he
and
I
and
the
collation
were
alone
,
``
I
give
you
joy
of
your
good
*NL*
fortune
.
Well
deserved
,
well
deserved
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
coming
to
the
point
,
and
I
thought
it
a
sensible
way
of
*NL*
expressing
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
after
snorting
admiration
at
me
for
*NL*
some
moments
,
``
that
I
should
have
been
the
humble
instrument
of
leading
*NL*
up
to
this
,
is
a
proud
reward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
begged
Mr.
Pumblechook
to
remember
that
nothing
was
to
be
ever
said
or
*NL*
hinted
,
on
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
young
friend
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
;
``
if
you
will
allow
me
to
*NL*
call
you
so
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
murmured
``
Certainly
,
''
and
Mr.
Pumblechook
took
me
by
both
hands
again
,
*NL*
and
communicated
a
movement
to
his
waistcoat
,
which
had
an
emotional
*NL*
appearance
,
though
it
was
rather
low
down
,
``
My
dear
young
friend
,
rely
*NL*
upon
my
doing
my
little
all
in
your
absence
,
by
keeping
the
fact
before
*NL*
the
mind
of
Joseph
.
--
Joseph
!
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
in
the
way
of
a
*NL*
compassionate
adjuration
.
``
Joseph
!!
Joseph
!!!
''
Thereupon
he
shook
his
*NL*
head
and
tapped
it
,
expressing
his
sense
of
deficiency
in
Joseph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
dear
young
friend
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
``
you
must
be
hungry
,
*NL*
you
must
be
exhausted
.
Be
seated
.
Here
is
a
chicken
had
round
from
the
*NL*
Boar
,
here
is
a
tongue
had
round
from
the
Boar
,
here
's
one
or
two
little
*NL*
things
had
round
from
the
Boar
,
that
I
hope
you
may
not
despise
.
But
do
*NL*
I
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
getting
up
again
the
moment
after
he
had
sat
*NL*
down
,
``
see
afore
me
,
him
as
I
ever
sported
with
in
his
times
of
happy
*NL*
infancy
?
And
may
I
--
may
I
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
May
I
,
meant
might
he
shake
hands
?
I
consented
,
and
he
was
fervent
,
*NL*
and
then
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
wine
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
.
``
Let
us
drink
,
Thanks
to
Fortune
,
*NL*
and
may
she
ever
pick
out
her
favorites
with
equal
judgment
!
And
yet
I
*NL*
can
not

''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
getting
up
again
,
``
see
afore
me
One
--
and
*NL*
likewise
drink
to
One

without
again
expressing
--
May
I

may
I

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
he
might
,
and
he
shook
hands
with
me
again
,
and
emptied
his
glass
*NL*
and
turned
it
upside
down
.
I
did
the
same
;
and
if
I
had
turned
myself
*NL*
upside
down
before
drinking
,
the
wine
could
not
have
gone
more
direct
to
*NL*
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pumblechook
helped
me
to
the
liver
wing
,
and
to
the
best
slice
of
*NL*
tongue
-LRB-
none
of
those
out-of-the-way
No
Thoroughfares
of
Pork
now
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
took
,
comparatively
speaking
,
no
care
of
himself
at
all
.
``
Ah
!
poultry
,
*NL*
poultry
!
You
little
thought
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
apostrophizing
the
*NL*
fowl
in
the
dish
,
``
when
you
was
a
young
fledgling
,
what
was
in
store
for
*NL*
you
.
You
little
thought
you
was
to
be
refreshment
beneath
this
humble
*NL*
roof
for
one
as

Call
it
a
weakness

if
you
will

''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
*NL*
getting
up
again
,
``
but
may
I
?
may
I
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
to
be
unnecessary
to
repeat
the
form
of
saying
he
might
,
so
*NL*
he
did
it
at
once
.
How
he
ever
did
it
so
often
without
wounding
himself
*NL*
with
my
knife
,
I
do
n't
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
sister

''
he
resumed
,
after
a
little
steady
eating
,
``
which
had
*NL*
the
honor
of
bringing
you
up
by

It
's
a
sad
picter

that
*NL*
she
's
no
longer
equal
to
fully
understanding
the
honor

May

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
he
was
about
to
come
at
me
again
,
and
I
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
drink
her
health
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
quite
flaccid
*NL*
with
admiration
,
``
that
's
the
way
you
know
'em
,
sir
!
''
-LRB-
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
who
Sir
was
,
but
he
certainly
was
not
I
,
and
there
was
no
third
person
*NL*
present
-RRB-
;
``
that
's
the
way
you
know
the
noble-minded
,
sir
!
Ever
forgiving
*NL*
and
ever
affable
.
It
might
,
''
said
the
servile
Pumblechook
,
putting
down
*NL*
his
untasted
glass
in
a
hurry
and
getting
up
again
,
``
to
a
common
person
,
*NL*
have
the
appearance
of
repeating
--
but
may
I
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
done
it
,
he
resumed
his
seat
and
drank
to
my
sister
.
``
Let
us
*NL*
never
be
blind
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
``
to
her
faults
of
temper
,
but
it
*NL*
is
to
be
hoped
she
meant
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
this
time
,
I
began
to
observe
that
he
was
getting
flushed
in
*NL*
the
face
;
as
to
myself
,
I
felt
all
face
,
steeped
in
wine
and
smarting
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mentioned
to
Mr.
Pumblechook
that
I
wished
to
have
my
new
clothes
*NL*
sent
to
his
house
,
and
he
was
ecstatic
on
my
so
distinguishing
him
.
I
*NL*
mentioned
my
reason
for
desiring
to
avoid
observation
in
the
village
,
*NL*
and
he
lauded
it
to
the
skies
.
There
was
nobody
but
himself
,
he
*NL*
intimated
,
worthy
of
my
confidence
,
and
--
in
short
,
might
he
?
Then
he
*NL*
asked
me
tenderly
if
I
remembered
our
boyish
games
at
sums
,
and
how
we
*NL*
had
gone
together
to
have
me
bound
apprentice
,
and
,
in
effect
,
how
he
*NL*
had
ever
been
my
favorite
fancy
and
my
chosen
friend
?
If
I
had
taken
*NL*
ten
times
as
many
glasses
of
wine
as
I
had
,
I
should
have
known
that
he
*NL*
never
had
stood
in
that
relation
towards
me
,
and
should
in
my
heart
of
*NL*
hearts
have
repudiated
the
idea
.
Yet
for
all
that
,
I
remember
feeling
*NL*
convinced
that
I
had
been
much
mistaken
in
him
,
and
that
he
was
a
*NL*
sensible
,
practical
,
good-hearted
prime
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
he
fell
to
reposing
such
great
confidence
in
me
,
as
to
ask
my
*NL*
advice
in
reference
to
his
own
affairs
.
He
mentioned
that
there
was
an
*NL*
opportunity
for
a
great
amalgamation
and
monopoly
of
the
corn
and
seed
*NL*
trade
on
those
premises
,
if
enlarged
,
such
as
had
never
occurred
*NL*
before
in
that
or
any
other
neighborhood
.
What
alone
was
wanting
to
the
*NL*
realization
of
a
vast
fortune
,
he
considered
to
be
More
Capital
.
*NL*
Those
were
the
two
little
words
,
more
capital
.
Now
it
appeared
to
him
*NL*
-LRB-
Pumblechook
-RRB-
that
if
that
capital
were
got
into
the
business
,
through
a
*NL*
sleeping
partner
,
sir
,
--
which
sleeping
partner
would
have
nothing
to
*NL*
do
but
walk
in
,
by
self
or
deputy
,
whenever
he
pleased
,
and
examine
*NL*
the
books
,
--
and
walk
in
twice
a
year
and
take
his
profits
away
in
his
*NL*
pocket
,
to
the
tune
of
fifty
per
cent
,
--
it
appeared
to
him
that
that
*NL*
might
be
an
opening
for
a
young
gentleman
of
spirit
combined
with
*NL*
property
,
which
would
be
worthy
of
his
attention
.
But
what
did
I
think
?
*NL*
He
had
great
confidence
in
my
opinion
,
and
what
did
I
think
?
I
gave
it
*NL*
as
my
opinion
.
``
Wait
a
bit
!
''
The
united
vastness
and
distinctness
of
*NL*
this
view
so
struck
him
,
that
he
no
longer
asked
if
he
might
shake
hands
*NL*
with
me
,
but
said
he
really
must
,
--
and
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
drank
all
the
wine
,
and
Mr.
Pumblechook
pledged
himself
over
and
over
*NL*
again
to
keep
Joseph
up
to
the
mark
-LRB-
I
do
n't
know
what
mark
-RRB-
,
and
to
*NL*
render
me
efficient
and
constant
service
-LRB-
I
do
n't
know
what
service
-RRB-
.
He
*NL*
also
made
known
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
and
certainly
after
*NL*
having
kept
his
secret
wonderfully
well
,
that
he
had
always
said
of
me
,
*NL*
``
That
boy
is
no
common
boy
,
and
mark
me
,
his
fortun
'
will
be
no
common
*NL*
fortun
'
.
''
He
said
with
a
tearful
smile
that
it
was
a
singular
thing
to
*NL*
think
of
now
,
and
I
said
so
too
.
Finally
,
I
went
out
into
the
air
,
with
*NL*
a
dim
perception
that
there
was
something
unwonted
in
the
conduct
of
the
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
found
that
I
had
slumberously
got
to
the
turnpike
without
*NL*
having
taken
any
account
of
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
I
was
roused
by
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
hailing
me
.
He
was
a
long
way
*NL*
down
the
sunny
street
,
and
was
making
expressive
gestures
for
me
to
*NL*
stop
.
I
stopped
,
and
he
came
up
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
said
he
,
when
he
had
recovered
wind
for
speech
.
*NL*
``
Not
if
I
can
help
it
.
This
occasion
shall
not
entirely
pass
without
*NL*
that
affability
on
your
part
.
--
May
I
,
as
an
old
friend
and
well-wisher
?
*NL*
May
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
shook
hands
for
the
hundredth
time
at
least
,
and
he
ordered
a
young
*NL*
carter
out
of
my
way
with
the
greatest
indignation
.
Then
,
he
blessed
*NL*
me
and
stood
waving
his
hand
to
me
until
I
had
passed
the
crook
in
the
*NL*
road
;
and
then
I
turned
into
a
field
and
had
a
long
nap
under
a
hedge
*NL*
before
I
pursued
my
way
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
scant
luggage
to
take
with
me
to
London
,
for
little
of
the
little
*NL*
I
possessed
was
adapted
to
my
new
station
.
But
I
began
packing
that
same
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
wildly
packed
up
things
that
I
knew
I
should
want
next
*NL*
morning
,
in
a
fiction
that
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
,
and
Thursday
,
passed
;
and
on
Friday
morning
I
*NL*
went
to
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
,
to
put
on
my
new
clothes
and
pay
my
visit
to
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
own
room
was
given
up
to
me
to
dress
*NL*
in
,
and
was
decorated
with
clean
towels
expressly
for
the
event
.
My
*NL*
clothes
were
rather
a
disappointment
,
of
course
.
Probably
every
new
*NL*
and
eagerly
expected
garment
ever
put
on
since
clothes
came
in
,
fell
*NL*
a
trifle
short
of
the
wearer
's
expectation
.
But
after
I
had
had
my
*NL*
new
suit
on
some
half
an
hour
,
and
had
gone
through
an
immensity
of
*NL*
posturing
with
Mr.
Pumblechook
's
very
limited
dressing-glass
,
in
the
*NL*
futile
endeavor
to
see
my
legs
,
it
seemed
to
fit
me
better
.
It
being
*NL*
market
morning
at
a
neighboring
town
some
ten
miles
off
,
Mr.
Pumblechook
*NL*
was
not
at
home
.
I
had
not
told
him
exactly
when
I
meant
to
leave
,
and
*NL*
was
not
likely
to
shake
hands
with
him
again
before
departing
.
This
was
*NL*
all
as
it
should
be
,
and
I
went
out
in
my
new
array
,
fearfully
ashamed
*NL*
of
having
to
pass
the
shopman
,
and
suspicious
after
all
that
I
was
at
a
*NL*
personal
disadvantage
,
something
like
Joe
's
in
his
Sunday
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
circuitously
to
Miss
Havisham
's
by
all
the
back
ways
,
and
rang
*NL*
at
the
bell
constrainedly
,
on
account
of
the
stiff
long
fingers
of
my
*NL*
gloves
.
Sarah
Pocket
came
to
the
gate
,
and
positively
reeled
back
when
*NL*
she
saw
me
so
changed
;
her
walnut-shell
countenance
likewise
turned
from
*NL*
brown
to
green
and
yellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
said
she
.
``
You
?
Good
gracious
!
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
London
,
Miss
Pocket
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
want
to
say
good-bye
to
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
expected
,
for
she
left
me
locked
in
the
yard
,
while
she
went
*NL*
to
ask
if
I
were
to
be
admitted
.
After
a
very
short
delay
,
she
returned
*NL*
and
took
me
up
,
staring
at
me
all
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
was
taking
exercise
in
the
room
with
the
long
spread
*NL*
table
,
leaning
on
her
crutch
stick
.
The
room
was
lighted
as
of
yore
,
and
*NL*
at
the
sound
of
our
entrance
,
she
stopped
and
turned
.
She
was
then
just
*NL*
abreast
of
the
rotted
bride-cake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
,
Sarah
,
''
she
said
.
``
Well
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
start
for
London
,
Miss
Havisham
,
to-morrow
,
''
I
was
exceedingly
*NL*
careful
what
I
said
,
``
and
I
thought
you
would
kindly
not
mind
my
taking
*NL*
leave
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
gay
figure
,
Pip
,
''
said
she
,
making
her
crutch
stick
play
*NL*
round
me
,
as
if
she
,
the
fairy
godmother
who
had
changed
me
,
were
*NL*
bestowing
the
finishing
gift
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
into
such
good
fortune
since
I
saw
you
last
,
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
,
''
I
murmured
.
``
And
I
am
so
grateful
for
it
,
Miss
Havisham
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
!
''
said
she
,
looking
at
the
discomfited
and
envious
Sarah
,
with
*NL*
delight
.
``
I
have
seen
Mr.
Jaggers
.
I
have
heard
about
it
,
Pip
.
So
you
go
*NL*
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
adopted
by
a
rich
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
named
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Miss
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mr.
Jaggers
is
made
your
guardian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
quite
gloated
on
these
questions
and
answers
,
so
keen
was
her
*NL*
enjoyment
of
Sarah
Pocket
's
jealous
dismay
.
``
Well
!
''
she
went
on
;
``
you
*NL*
have
a
promising
career
before
you
.
Be
good
--
deserve
it
--
and
abide
by
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
's
instructions
.
''
She
looked
at
me
,
and
looked
at
Sarah
,
and
*NL*
Sarah
's
countenance
wrung
out
of
her
watchful
face
a
cruel
smile
.
``
Good-bye
,
*NL*
Pip
!
--
you
will
always
keep
the
name
of
Pip
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Miss
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Pip
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stretched
out
her
hand
,
and
I
went
down
on
my
knee
and
put
it
to
*NL*
my
lips
.
I
had
not
considered
how
I
should
take
leave
of
her
;
it
came
*NL*
naturally
to
me
at
the
moment
to
do
this
.
She
looked
at
Sarah
Pocket
*NL*
with
triumph
in
her
weird
eyes
,
and
so
I
left
my
fairy
godmother
,
with
*NL*
both
her
hands
on
her
crutch
stick
,
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
dimly
*NL*
lighted
room
beside
the
rotten
bride-cake
that
was
hidden
in
cobwebs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sarah
Pocket
conducted
me
down
,
as
if
I
were
a
ghost
who
must
be
seen
*NL*
out
.
She
could
not
get
over
my
appearance
,
and
was
in
the
last
degree
*NL*
confounded
.
I
said
``
Good-bye
,
Miss
Pocket
;
''
but
she
merely
stared
,
and
*NL*
did
not
seem
collected
enough
to
know
that
I
had
spoken
.
Clear
of
the
*NL*
house
,
I
made
the
best
of
my
way
back
to
Pumblechook
's
,
took
off
my
new
*NL*
clothes
,
made
them
into
a
bundle
,
and
went
back
home
in
my
older
dress
,
*NL*
carrying
it
--
to
speak
the
truth
--
much
more
at
my
ease
too
,
though
I
had
*NL*
the
bundle
to
carry
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
those
six
days
which
were
to
have
run
out
so
slowly
,
had
*NL*
run
out
fast
and
were
gone
,
and
to-morrow
looked
me
in
the
face
more
*NL*
steadily
than
I
could
look
at
it
.
As
the
six
evenings
had
dwindled
*NL*
away
,
to
five
,
to
four
,
to
three
,
to
two
,
I
had
become
more
and
more
*NL*
appreciative
of
the
society
of
Joe
and
Biddy
.
On
this
last
evening
,
I
*NL*
dressed
my
self
out
in
my
new
clothes
for
their
delight
,
and
sat
in
my
*NL*
splendor
until
bedtime
.
We
had
a
hot
supper
on
the
occasion
,
graced
by
*NL*
the
inevitable
roast
fowl
,
and
we
had
some
flip
to
finish
with
.
We
were
*NL*
all
very
low
,
and
none
the
higher
for
pretending
to
be
in
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
to
leave
our
village
at
five
in
the
morning
,
carrying
my
little
*NL*
hand-portmanteau
,
and
I
had
told
Joe
that
I
wished
to
walk
away
all
*NL*
alone
.
I
am
afraid
--
sore
afraid
--
that
this
purpose
originated
in
my
*NL*
sense
of
the
contrast
there
would
be
between
me
and
Joe
,
if
we
went
to
*NL*
the
coach
together
.
I
had
pretended
with
myself
that
there
was
nothing
*NL*
of
this
taint
in
the
arrangement
;
but
when
I
went
up
to
my
little
room
*NL*
on
this
last
night
,
I
felt
compelled
to
admit
that
it
might
be
so
,
and
*NL*
had
an
impulse
upon
me
to
go
down
again
and
entreat
Joe
to
walk
with
me
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
I
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
night
there
were
coaches
in
my
broken
sleep
,
going
to
wrong
places
*NL*
instead
of
to
London
,
and
having
in
the
traces
,
now
dogs
,
now
cats
,
now
*NL*
pigs
,
now
men
,
--
never
horses
.
Fantastic
failures
of
journeys
occupied
*NL*
me
until
the
day
dawned
and
the
birds
were
singing
.
Then
,
I
got
up
and
*NL*
partly
dressed
,
and
sat
at
the
window
to
take
a
last
look
out
,
and
in
*NL*
taking
it
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
was
astir
so
early
to
get
my
breakfast
,
that
,
although
I
did
not
*NL*
sleep
at
the
window
an
hour
,
I
smelt
the
smoke
of
the
kitchen
fire
when
*NL*
I
started
up
with
a
terrible
idea
that
it
must
be
late
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
But
long
after
that
,
and
long
after
I
had
heard
the
clinking
of
the
*NL*
teacups
and
was
quite
ready
,
I
wanted
the
resolution
to
go
downstairs
.
*NL*
After
all
,
I
remained
up
there
,
repeatedly
unlocking
and
unstrapping
*NL*
my
small
portmanteau
and
locking
and
strapping
it
up
again
,
until
Biddy
*NL*
called
to
me
that
I
was
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
hurried
breakfast
with
no
taste
in
it
.
I
got
up
from
the
meal
,
*NL*
saying
with
a
sort
of
briskness
,
as
if
it
had
only
just
occurred
to
me
,
*NL*
``
Well
!
I
suppose
I
must
be
off
!
''
and
then
I
kissed
my
sister
who
was
*NL*
laughing
and
nodding
and
shaking
in
her
usual
chair
,
and
kissed
*NL*
Biddy
,
and
threw
my
arms
around
Joe
's
neck
.
Then
I
took
up
my
little
*NL*
portmanteau
and
walked
out
.
The
last
I
saw
of
them
was
,
when
I
presently
*NL*
heard
a
scuffle
behind
me
,
and
looking
back
,
saw
Joe
throwing
an
old
*NL*
shoe
after
me
and
Biddy
throwing
another
old
shoe
.
I
stopped
then
,
to
*NL*
wave
my
hat
,
and
dear
old
Joe
waved
his
strong
right
arm
above
his
head
,
*NL*
crying
huskily
``
Hooroar
!
''
and
Biddy
put
her
apron
to
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
away
at
a
good
pace
,
thinking
it
was
easier
to
go
than
I
had
*NL*
supposed
it
would
be
,
and
reflecting
that
it
would
never
have
done
to
*NL*
have
had
an
old
shoe
thrown
after
the
coach
,
in
sight
of
all
the
High
*NL*
Street
.
I
whistled
and
made
nothing
of
going
.
But
the
village
was
very
*NL*
peaceful
and
quiet
,
and
the
light
mists
were
solemnly
rising
,
as
if
to
*NL*
show
me
the
world
,
and
I
had
been
so
innocent
and
little
there
,
and
all
*NL*
beyond
was
so
unknown
and
great
,
that
in
a
moment
with
a
strong
heave
*NL*
and
sob
I
broke
into
tears
.
It
was
by
the
finger-post
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
village
,
and
I
laid
my
hand
upon
it
,
and
said
,
``
Good-bye
,
O
my
dear
,
dear
*NL*
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Heaven
knows
we
need
never
be
ashamed
of
our
tears
,
for
they
are
rain
*NL*
upon
the
blinding
dust
of
earth
,
overlying
our
hard
hearts
.
I
was
*NL*
better
after
I
had
cried
than
before
,
--
more
sorry
,
more
aware
of
my
own
*NL*
ingratitude
,
more
gentle
.
If
I
had
cried
before
,
I
should
have
had
Joe
*NL*
with
me
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
subdued
I
was
by
those
tears
,
and
by
their
breaking
out
again
in
the
*NL*
course
of
the
quiet
walk
,
that
when
I
was
on
the
coach
,
and
it
was
clear
*NL*
of
the
town
,
I
deliberated
with
an
aching
heart
whether
I
would
not
get
*NL*
down
when
we
changed
horses
and
walk
back
,
and
have
another
evening
at
*NL*
home
,
and
a
better
parting
.
We
changed
,
and
I
had
not
made
up
my
mind
,
*NL*
and
still
reflected
for
my
comfort
that
it
would
be
quite
practicable
to
*NL*
get
down
and
walk
back
,
when
we
changed
again
.
And
while
I
was
occupied
*NL*
with
these
deliberations
,
I
would
fancy
an
exact
resemblance
to
Joe
*NL*
in
some
man
coming
along
the
road
towards
us
,
and
my
heart
would
beat
*NL*
high
.
--
As
if
he
could
possibly
be
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
We
changed
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
it
was
now
too
late
and
too
far
to
*NL*
go
back
,
and
I
went
on
.
And
the
mists
had
all
solemnly
risen
now
,
and
*NL*
the
world
lay
spread
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
end
of
the
first
stage
of
Pip
's
expectations
.

Chapter
XX
*NL*
*NL*
The
journey
from
our
town
to
the
metropolis
was
a
journey
of
about
five
*NL*
hours
.
It
was
a
little
past
midday
when
the
four-horse
stage-coach
by
*NL*
which
I
was
a
passenger
,
got
into
the
ravel
of
traffic
frayed
out
about
*NL*
the
Cross
Keys
,
Wood
Street
,
Cheapside
,
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
Britons
had
at
that
time
particularly
settled
that
it
was
treasonable
*NL*
to
doubt
our
having
and
our
being
the
best
of
everything
:
otherwise
,
*NL*
while
I
was
scared
by
the
immensity
of
London
,
I
think
I
might
have
had
*NL*
some
faint
doubts
whether
it
was
not
rather
ugly
,
crooked
,
narrow
,
and
*NL*
dirty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
had
duly
sent
me
his
address
;
it
was
,
Little
Britain
,
and
he
*NL*
had
written
after
it
on
his
card
,
``
just
out
of
Smithfield
,
and
close
by
*NL*
the
coach-office
.
''
Nevertheless
,
a
hackney-coachman
,
who
seemed
to
have
*NL*
as
many
capes
to
his
greasy
great-coat
as
he
was
years
old
,
packed
me
*NL*
up
in
his
coach
and
hemmed
me
in
with
a
folding
and
jingling
barrier
of
*NL*
steps
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
take
me
fifty
miles
.
His
getting
on
his
*NL*
box
,
which
I
remember
to
have
been
decorated
with
an
old
weather-stained
*NL*
pea-green
hammercloth
moth-eaten
into
rags
,
was
quite
a
work
of
time
.
*NL*
It
was
a
wonderful
equipage
,
with
six
great
coronets
outside
,
and
ragged
*NL*
things
behind
for
I
do
n't
know
how
many
footmen
to
hold
on
by
,
and
*NL*
a
harrow
below
them
,
to
prevent
amateur
footmen
from
yielding
to
the
*NL*
temptation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
scarcely
had
time
to
enjoy
the
coach
and
to
think
how
like
a
*NL*
straw-yard
it
was
,
and
yet
how
like
a
rag-shop
,
and
to
wonder
why
*NL*
the
horses
'
nose-bags
were
kept
inside
,
when
I
observed
the
coachman
*NL*
beginning
to
get
down
,
as
if
we
were
going
to
stop
presently
.
And
stop
*NL*
we
presently
did
,
in
a
gloomy
street
,
at
certain
offices
with
an
open
*NL*
door
,
whereon
was
painted
MR.
JAGGERS
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
I
asked
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
answered
,
``
A
shilling
--
unless
you
wish
to
make
it
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
naturally
said
I
had
no
wish
to
make
it
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
must
be
a
shilling
,
''
observed
the
coachman
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
get
into
trouble
.
I
know
him
!
''
He
darkly
closed
an
eye
at
Mr.
Jaggers
's
*NL*
name
,
and
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
got
his
shilling
,
and
had
in
course
of
time
completed
the
*NL*
ascent
to
his
box
,
and
had
got
away
-LRB-
which
appeared
to
relieve
his
*NL*
mind
-RRB-
,
I
went
into
the
front
office
with
my
little
portmanteau
in
my
*NL*
hand
and
asked
,
Was
Mr.
Jaggers
at
home
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
,
''
returned
the
clerk
.
``
He
is
in
Court
at
present
.
Am
I
*NL*
addressing
Mr.
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
signified
that
he
was
addressing
Mr.
Pip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jaggers
left
word
,
would
you
wait
in
his
room
.
He
could
n't
say
how
*NL*
long
he
might
be
,
having
a
case
on
.
But
it
stands
to
reason
,
his
time
*NL*
being
valuable
,
that
he
wo
n't
be
longer
than
he
can
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
those
words
,
the
clerk
opened
a
door
,
and
ushered
me
into
an
inner
*NL*
chamber
at
the
back
.
Here
,
we
found
a
gentleman
with
one
eye
,
in
a
*NL*
velveteen
suit
and
knee-breeches
,
who
wiped
his
nose
with
his
sleeve
on
*NL*
being
interrupted
in
the
perusal
of
the
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
wait
outside
,
Mike
,
''
said
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
say
that
I
hoped
I
was
not
interrupting
,
when
the
clerk
*NL*
shoved
this
gentleman
out
with
as
little
ceremony
as
I
ever
saw
used
,
*NL*
and
tossing
his
fur
cap
out
after
him
,
left
me
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
's
room
was
lighted
by
a
skylight
only
,
and
was
a
most
dismal
*NL*
place
;
the
skylight
,
eccentrically
pitched
like
a
broken
head
,
and
the
*NL*
distorted
adjoining
houses
looking
as
if
they
had
twisted
themselves
to
*NL*
peep
down
at
me
through
it
.
There
were
not
so
many
papers
about
,
as
I
*NL*
should
have
expected
to
see
;
and
there
were
some
odd
objects
about
,
that
*NL*
I
should
not
have
expected
to
see
,
--
such
as
an
old
rusty
pistol
,
a
*NL*
sword
in
a
scabbard
,
several
strange-looking
boxes
and
packages
,
and
*NL*
two
dreadful
casts
on
a
shelf
,
of
faces
peculiarly
swollen
,
and
twitchy
*NL*
about
the
nose
.
Mr.
Jaggers
's
own
high-backed
chair
was
of
deadly
black
*NL*
horsehair
,
with
rows
of
brass
nails
round
it
,
like
a
coffin
;
and
I
*NL*
fancied
I
could
see
how
he
leaned
back
in
it
,
and
bit
his
forefinger
at
*NL*
the
clients
.
The
room
was
but
small
,
and
the
clients
seemed
to
have
had
*NL*
a
habit
of
backing
up
against
the
wall
;
the
wall
,
especially
opposite
to
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
's
chair
,
being
greasy
with
shoulders
.
I
recalled
,
too
,
that
*NL*
the
one-eyed
gentleman
had
shuffled
forth
against
the
wall
when
I
was
*NL*
the
innocent
cause
of
his
being
turned
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
in
the
cliental
chair
placed
over
against
Mr.
Jaggers
's
*NL*
chair
,
and
became
fascinated
by
the
dismal
atmosphere
of
the
place
.
I
*NL*
called
to
mind
that
the
clerk
had
the
same
air
of
knowing
something
to
*NL*
everybody
else
's
disadvantage
,
as
his
master
had
.
I
wondered
how
many
*NL*
other
clerks
there
were
upstairs
,
and
whether
they
all
claimed
to
have
*NL*
the
same
detrimental
mastery
of
their
fellow-creatures
.
I
wondered
what
*NL*
was
the
history
of
all
the
odd
litter
about
the
room
,
and
how
it
came
*NL*
there
.
I
wondered
whether
the
two
swollen
faces
were
of
Mr.
Jaggers
's
*NL*
family
,
and
,
if
he
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
had
a
pair
of
such
*NL*
ill-looking
relations
,
why
he
stuck
them
on
that
dusty
perch
for
the
*NL*
blacks
and
flies
to
settle
on
,
instead
of
giving
them
a
place
at
home
.
*NL*
Of
course
I
had
no
experience
of
a
London
summer
day
,
and
my
spirits
may
*NL*
have
been
oppressed
by
the
hot
exhausted
air
,
and
by
the
dust
and
grit
*NL*
that
lay
thick
on
everything
.
But
I
sat
wondering
and
waiting
in
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
's
close
room
,
until
I
really
could
not
bear
the
two
casts
on
the
*NL*
shelf
above
Mr.
Jaggers
's
chair
,
and
got
up
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
told
the
clerk
that
I
would
take
a
turn
in
the
air
while
I
*NL*
waited
,
he
advised
me
to
go
round
the
corner
and
I
should
come
into
*NL*
Smithfield
.
So
I
came
into
Smithfield
;
and
the
shameful
place
,
being
all
*NL*
asmear
with
filth
and
fat
and
blood
and
foam
,
seemed
to
stick
to
me
.
So
,
*NL*
I
rubbed
it
off
with
all
possible
speed
by
turning
into
a
street
where
*NL*
I
saw
the
great
black
dome
of
Saint
Paul
's
bulging
at
me
from
behind
a
*NL*
grim
stone
building
which
a
bystander
said
was
Newgate
Prison
.
Following
*NL*
the
wall
of
the
jail
,
I
found
the
roadway
covered
with
straw
to
deaden
*NL*
the
noise
of
passing
vehicles
;
and
from
this
,
and
from
the
quantity
of
*NL*
people
standing
about
smelling
strongly
of
spirits
and
beer
,
I
inferred
*NL*
that
the
trials
were
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
looked
about
me
here
,
an
exceedingly
dirty
and
partially
drunk
*NL*
minister
of
justice
asked
me
if
I
would
like
to
step
in
and
hear
a
*NL*
trial
or
so
:
informing
me
that
he
could
give
me
a
front
place
for
half
a
*NL*
crown
,
whence
I
should
command
a
full
view
of
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
in
*NL*
his
wig
and
robes
,
--
mentioning
that
awful
personage
like
waxwork
,
and
*NL*
presently
offering
him
at
the
reduced
price
of
eighteen-pence
.
As
I
*NL*
declined
the
proposal
on
the
plea
of
an
appointment
,
he
was
so
good
as
*NL*
to
take
me
into
a
yard
and
show
me
where
the
gallows
was
kept
,
and
also
*NL*
where
people
were
publicly
whipped
,
and
then
he
showed
me
the
Debtors
'
*NL*
Door
,
out
of
which
culprits
came
to
be
hanged
;
heightening
the
interest
*NL*
of
that
dreadful
portal
by
giving
me
to
understand
that
``
four
on
'em
''
*NL*
would
come
out
at
that
door
the
day
after
to-morrow
at
eight
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
to
be
killed
in
a
row
.
This
was
horrible
,
and
gave
me
a
*NL*
sickening
idea
of
London
;
the
more
so
as
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
's
*NL*
proprietor
wore
-LRB-
from
his
hat
down
to
his
boots
and
up
again
to
his
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
inclusive
-RRB-
mildewed
clothes
which
had
evidently
*NL*
not
belonged
to
him
originally
,
and
which
I
took
it
into
my
head
he
had
*NL*
bought
cheap
of
the
executioner
.
Under
these
circumstances
I
thought
*NL*
myself
well
rid
of
him
for
a
shilling
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dropped
into
the
office
to
ask
if
Mr.
Jaggers
had
come
in
yet
,
and
I
*NL*
found
he
had
not
,
and
I
strolled
out
again
.
This
time
,
I
made
the
tour
*NL*
of
Little
Britain
,
and
turned
into
Bartholomew
Close
;
and
now
I
became
*NL*
aware
that
other
people
were
waiting
about
for
Mr.
Jaggers
,
as
well
*NL*
as
I
.
There
were
two
men
of
secret
appearance
lounging
in
Bartholomew
*NL*
Close
,
and
thoughtfully
fitting
their
feet
into
the
cracks
of
the
*NL*
pavement
as
they
talked
together
,
one
of
whom
said
to
the
other
when
*NL*
they
first
passed
me
,
that
``
Jaggers
would
do
it
if
it
was
to
be
done
.
''
*NL*
There
was
a
knot
of
three
men
and
two
women
standing
at
a
corner
,
and
*NL*
one
of
the
women
was
crying
on
her
dirty
shawl
,
and
the
other
comforted
*NL*
her
by
saying
,
as
she
pulled
her
own
shawl
over
her
shoulders
,
``
Jaggers
*NL*
is
for
him
,
`
Melia
,
and
what
more
could
you
have
?
''
There
was
a
red-eyed
*NL*
little
Jew
who
came
into
the
Close
while
I
was
loitering
there
,
in
*NL*
company
with
a
second
little
Jew
whom
he
sent
upon
an
errand
;
and
*NL*
while
the
messenger
was
gone
,
I
remarked
this
Jew
,
who
was
of
a
highly
*NL*
excitable
temperament
,
performing
a
jig
of
anxiety
under
a
lamp-post
and
*NL*
accompanying
himself
,
in
a
kind
of
frenzy
,
with
the
words
,
``
O
Jaggerth
,
*NL*
Jaggerth
,
Jaggerth
!
all
otherth
ith
Cag-Maggerth
,
give
me
Jaggerth
!
''
*NL*
These
testimonies
to
the
popularity
of
my
guardian
made
a
deep
*NL*
impression
on
me
,
and
I
admired
and
wondered
more
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
as
I
was
looking
out
at
the
iron
gate
of
Bartholomew
Close
*NL*
into
Little
Britain
,
I
saw
Mr.
Jaggers
coming
across
the
road
towards
*NL*
me
.
All
the
others
who
were
waiting
saw
him
at
the
same
time
,
and
there
*NL*
was
quite
a
rush
at
him
.
Mr.
Jaggers
,
putting
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
*NL*
and
walking
me
on
at
his
side
without
saying
anything
to
me
,
addressed
*NL*
himself
to
his
followers
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
he
took
the
two
secret
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
throwing
his
*NL*
finger
at
them
.
``
I
want
to
know
no
more
than
I
know
.
As
to
the
result
,
*NL*
it
's
a
toss-up
.
I
told
you
from
the
first
it
was
a
toss-up
.
Have
you
*NL*
paid
Wemmick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
made
the
money
up
this
morning
,
sir
,
''
said
one
of
the
men
,
*NL*
submissively
,
while
the
other
perused
Mr.
Jaggers
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
ask
you
when
you
made
it
up
,
or
where
,
or
whether
you
made
it
*NL*
up
at
all
.
Has
Wemmick
got
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
both
the
men
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
then
you
may
go
.
Now
,
I
wo
n't
have
it
!
''
said
Mr
Jaggers
,
*NL*
waving
his
hand
at
them
to
put
them
behind
him
.
``
If
you
say
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought

Mr.
Jaggers
--

one
of
the
men
began
,
pulling
off
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
told
you
not
to
do

''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
You
thought

I
*NL*
think
for

that
's

for

If

I

I
do

Now
I
wo

I
wo
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
looked
at
one
another
as
Mr.
Jaggers
waved
them
behind
*NL*
again
,
and
humbly
fell
back
and
were
heard
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
you
!
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
suddenly
stopping
,
and
turning
on
*NL*
the
two
women
with
the
shawls
,
from
whom
the
three
men
had
meekly
*NL*
separated
,
--
``
Oh
!
Amelia
,
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mr.
Jaggers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
remember
,
''
retorted
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
that
but
for
me
you
*NL*
would
n't
be
here
and
could
n't
be
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
sir

''
exclaimed
both
women
together
.
``
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
,
well
*NL*
we
knows
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
do
you
come
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Bill

!
''
the
crying
woman
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
tell
you
what
!
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
Once
for
all
.
If

And
if

*NL*

I
'll
make
an

*NL*
*NL*
This
terrible
threat
caused
the
two
women
to
fall
off
immediately
.
*NL*
No
one
remained
now
but
the
excitable
Jew
,
who
had
already
raised
the
*NL*
skirts
of
Mr.
Jaggers
's
coat
to
his
lips
several
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
in
the
same
devastating
*NL*
strain
:
``

*NL*
*NL*

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
The
suitor

kissing
the
hem
of

again
before
relinquishing

it

replied

*NL*

My
guardian
threw
his
supplicant
off
with
supreme
indifference
,
and
*NL*
left
him
dancing
on
the
pavement
as
if
it
were
red
hot
.
Without
further
*NL*
interruption
,
we
reached
the
front
office
,
where
we
found
the
clerk
and
*NL*
the
man
in
velveteen
with
the
fur
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Mike
,
''
said
the
clerk
,
getting
down
from
his
stool
,
and
*NL*
approaching
Mr.
Jaggers
confidentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
turning
to
the
man
,
who
was
pulling
a
lock
of
*NL*
hair
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
,
like
the
Bull
in
Cock
Robin
pulling
*NL*
at
the
bell-rope
;
``
your

on
this
afternoon
.
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mas

Jaggers

''
returned
Mike
,
in
the
voice
of
a
sufferer
from
a
*NL*
constitutional
cold
;
``
arter
a
deal

I
've
found

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Mike
,
wiping
his
nose
on
his
fur
cap
this
*NL*
time
;
``
in
a
general
way

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
suddenly
became
most
irate
.
``
Now
,
I
warned
you
before
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
throwing
his
forefinger
at
the
terrified
client
,
``
that
if
you
ever
*NL*
presumed

talk

here

You
*NL*
infernal
scoundrel
,
how
dare
you
tell
ME
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
client
looked
scared
,
but
bewildered
too
,
as
if
he
were
unconscious
*NL*
what
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spooney
!
''
said
the
clerk
,
in
a
low
voice
,
giving
him
a
stir
with
his
*NL*
elbow
.
``
Soft
Head
!
Need
you
say
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

I
ask

said
my

very
sternly
,
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mike
looked
hard
at
my
guardian
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
learn
a
lesson
*NL*
from
his
face
,
and
slowly
replied
,
``
Ayther
to

,
or
to

*NL*
been
in

company
and
never
left

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
be
careful
.
In
what
station
of
life
is
this
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mike
looked
at
his
cap
,
and
looked
at
the
floor
,
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
ceiling
,
and
looked
at
the
clerk
,
and
even
looked
at
me
,
before
*NL*
beginning
to
reply
in
a
nervous
manner
,
``
We
've
dressed
him
up
like
--
''
*NL*
when
my
guardian
blustered
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
You
WILL
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Spooney
!
''
added
the
clerk
again
,
with
another
stir
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
helpless
casting
about
,
Mike
brightened
and
began
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dressed
like
a
`
spectable
pieman
.
A
sort
of
a
pastry-cook
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
here
?
''
asked
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
him
,
''
said
Mike
,
``
a
setting
on
some
doorsteps
round
the
corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
him
past
that
window
,
and
let
me
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
window
indicated
was
the
office
window
.
We
all
three
went
to
*NL*
it
,
behind
the
wire
blind
,
and
presently
saw
the
client
go
by
in
an
*NL*
accidental
manner
,
with
a
murderous-looking
tall
individual
,
in
a
short
*NL*
suit
of
white
linen
and
a
paper
cap
.
This
guileless
confectioner
was
not
*NL*
by
any
means
sober
,
and
had
a
black
eye
in
the
green
stage
of
recovery
,
*NL*
which
was
painted
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
to
take
his
witness
away
directly
,
''
said
my
guardian
to
the
*NL*
clerk
,
in
extreme
disgust
,
``
and
ask
him
what
he
means
by
bringing
such
a
*NL*
fellow
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
then
took
me
into
his
own
room
,
and
while
he
lunched
,
*NL*
standing
,
from
a
sandwich-box
and
a
pocket-flask
of
sherry
-LRB-
he
seemed
to
*NL*
bully
his
very
sandwich
as
he
ate
it
-RRB-
,
informed
me
what
arrangements
he
*NL*
had
made
for
me
.
I
was
to
go
to
``
Barnard
's
Inn
,
''
to
young
Mr.
Pocket
's
*NL*
rooms
,
where
a
bed
had
been
sent
in
for
my
accommodation
;
I
was
to
*NL*
remain
with
young
Mr.
Pocket
until
Monday
;
on
Monday
I
was
to
go
with
*NL*
him
to
his
father
's
house
on
a
visit
,
that
I
might
try
how
I
liked
it
.
*NL*
Also
,
I
was
told
what
my
allowance
was
to
be
,
--
it
was
a
very
liberal
*NL*
one
,
--
and
had
handed
to
me
from
one
of
my
guardian
's
drawers
,
the
cards
*NL*
of
certain
tradesmen
with
whom
I
was
to
deal
for
all
kinds
of
clothes
,
*NL*
and
such
other
things
as
I
could
in
reason
want
.
``
You
will
find
your
*NL*
credit
good
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
whose
flask
of
sherry
smelt
*NL*
like
a
whole
caskful
,
as
he
hastily
refreshed
himself
,
``
but
I
shall
by
*NL*
this
means
be
able
to
check
your
bills
,
and
to
pull
you
up
if
I
find
you
*NL*
outrunning
the
constable
.
Of
course
you
'll
go
wrong
somehow
,
but
that
's
*NL*
no
fault
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
pondered
a
little
over
this
encouraging
sentiment
,
I
asked
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
if
I
could
send
for
a
coach
?
He
said
it
was
not
worth
while
,
*NL*
I
was
so
near
my
destination
;
Wemmick
should
walk
round
with
me
,
if
I
*NL*
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
then
found
that
Wemmick
was
the
clerk
in
the
next
room
.
Another
clerk
*NL*
was
rung
down
from
upstairs
to
take
his
place
while
he
was
out
,
and
I
*NL*
accompanied
him
into
the
street
,
after
shaking
hands
with
my
guardian
.
*NL*
We
found
a
new
set
of
people
lingering
outside
,
but
Wemmick
made
a
way
*NL*
among
them
by
saying
coolly
yet
decisively
,
``
I
tell
you
it
's
no
use
;
he
*NL*
wo
n't
have
a
word
to
say
to
one
of
you
;
''
and
we
soon
got
clear
of
them
,
*NL*
and
went
on
side
by
side
.

Chapter
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
Casting
my
eyes
on
Mr.
Wemmick
as
we
went
along
,
to
see
what
he
was
*NL*
like
in
the
light
of
day
,
I
found
him
to
be
a
dry
man
,
rather
short
in
*NL*
stature
,
with
a
square
wooden
face
,
whose
expression
seemed
to
have
been
*NL*
imperfectly
chipped
out
with
a
dull-edged
chisel
.
There
were
some
marks
*NL*
in
it
that
might
have
been
dimples
,
if
the
material
had
been
softer
and
*NL*
the
instrument
finer
,
but
which
,
as
it
was
,
were
only
dints
.
The
chisel
*NL*
had
made
three
or
four
of
these
attempts
at
embellishment
over
his
nose
,
*NL*
but
had
given
them
up
without
an
effort
to
smooth
them
off
.
I
judged
him
*NL*
to
be
a
bachelor
from
the
frayed
condition
of
his
linen
,
and
he
appeared
*NL*
to
have
sustained
a
good
many
bereavements
;
for
he
wore
at
least
four
*NL*
mourning
rings
,
besides
a
brooch
representing
a
lady
and
a
weeping
*NL*
willow
at
a
tomb
with
an
urn
on
it
.
I
noticed
,
too
,
that
several
rings
*NL*
and
seals
hung
at
his
watch-chain
,
as
if
he
were
quite
laden
with
*NL*
remembrances
of
departed
friends
.
He
had
glittering
eyes
,
--
small
,
keen
,
*NL*
and
black
,
--
and
thin
wide
mottled
lips
.
He
had
had
them
,
to
the
best
of
*NL*
my
belief
,
from
forty
to
fifty
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
were
never
in
London
before
?
''
said
Mr.
Wemmick
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
new
here
once
,
''
said
Mr.
Wemmick
.
``
Rum
to
think
of
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
well
acquainted
with
it
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Wemmick
.
``
I
know
the
moves
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
very
wicked
place
?
''
I
asked
,
more
for
the
sake
of
saying
*NL*
something
than
for
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
get
cheated
,
robbed
,
and
murdered
in
London
.
But
there

*NL*
plenty

who
'll
do
that
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
bad
blood
between
you
and
them
,
''
said
I
,
to
soften
it
off
a
*NL*
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
I
do
n't
know
about
bad
blood
,
''
returned
Mr.
Wemmick
;
``
there
's
not
*NL*
much
bad
blood
about

They
'll
do
it
,
if
there
's
anything

be
got
by
*NL*
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
it
worse

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

returned
Mr.
Wemmick
.
``
Much
about
the
same

I
should
*NL*
say

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wore
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
looked
straight
before
him
:
*NL*
walking
in
a
self-contained
way
as
if
there
were
nothing
in
the
streets
*NL*
to
claim
his
attention
.
His
mouth
was
such
a
post-office
of
a
mouth
*NL*
that
he
had
a
mechanical
appearance
of
smiling
.
We
had
got
to
the
top
of
*NL*
Holborn
Hill
before
I
knew
that
it
was
merely
a
mechanical
appearance
,
*NL*
and
that
he
was
not
smiling
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

Mr.
Matthew
Pocket
lives

I
asked
Mr.
Wemmick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
nodding
in
the
direction
.
``
At
Hammersmith
,
west
of
*NL*
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
Say
five
miles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
're
a
regular
cross-examiner
!
''
said
Mr.
Wemmick
,
looking
at
me
*NL*
with
an
approving
air
.
``
Yes
,
I
know
him
.
I
know
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
air
of
toleration
or
depreciation
about
his
utterance
of
*NL*
these
words
that
rather
depressed
me
;
and
I
was
still
looking
sideways
*NL*
at
his
block
of
a
face
in
search
of
any
encouraging
note
to
the
text
,
*NL*
when
he
said
here
we
were
at
Barnard
's
Inn
.
My
depression
was
not
*NL*
alleviated
by
the
announcement
,
for
,
I
had
supposed
that
establishment
*NL*
to
be
an
hotel
kept
by
Mr.
Barnard
,
to
which
the
Blue
Boar
in
our
town
*NL*
was
a
mere
public-house
.
Whereas
I
now
found
Barnard
to
be
a
disembodied
*NL*
spirit
,
or
a
fiction
,
and
his
inn
the
dingiest
collection
of
shabby
*NL*
buildings
ever
squeezed
together
in
a
rank
corner
as
a
club
for
*NL*
Tom-cats
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
entered
this
haven
through
a
wicket-gate
,
and
were
disgorged
by
an
*NL*
introductory
passage
into
a
melancholy
little
square
that
looked
to
me
*NL*
like
a
flat
burying-ground
.
I
thought
it
had
the
most
dismal
trees
in
*NL*
it
,
and
the
most
dismal
sparrows
,
and
the
most
dismal
cats
,
and
the
most
*NL*
dismal
houses
-LRB-
in
number
half
a
dozen
or
so
-RRB-
,
that
I
had
ever
seen
.
I
*NL*
thought
the
windows
of
the
sets
of
chambers
into
which
those
houses
were
*NL*
divided
were
in
every
stage
of
dilapidated
blind
and
curtain
,
crippled
*NL*
flower-pot
,
cracked
glass
,
dusty
decay
,
and
miserable
makeshift
;
while
*NL*
To
Let
,
To
Let
,
To
Let
,
glared
at
me
from
empty
rooms
,
as
if
no
new
*NL*
wretches
ever
came
there
,
and
the
vengeance
of
the
soul
of
Barnard
were
*NL*
being
slowly
appeased
by
the
gradual
suicide
of
the
present
occupants
*NL*
and
their
unholy
interment
under
the
gravel
.
A
frowzy
mourning
of
soot
*NL*
and
smoke
attired
this
forlorn
creation
of
Barnard
,
and
it
had
strewn
*NL*
ashes
on
its
head
,
and
was
undergoing
penance
and
humiliation
as
a
mere
*NL*
dust-hole
.
Thus
far
my
sense
of
sight
;
while
dry
rot
and
wet
rot
and
all
*NL*
the
silent
rots
that
rot
in
neglected
roof
and
cellar
,
--
rot
of
rat
*NL*
and
mouse
and
bug
and
coaching-stables
near
at
hand
besides
--
addressed
*NL*
themselves
faintly
to
my
sense
of
smell
,
and
moaned
,
``
Try
Barnard
's
*NL*
Mixture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
imperfect
was
this
realization
of
the
first
of
my
great
expectations
,
*NL*
that
I
looked
in
dismay
at
Mr.
Wemmick
.
``
Ah
!
''
said
he
,
mistaking
me
;
*NL*
``
the
retirement
reminds
you
of
the
country
.
So
it
does
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
led
me
into
a
corner
and
conducted
me
up
a
flight
of
stairs
,
--
which
*NL*
appeared
to
me
to
be
slowly
collapsing
into
sawdust
,
so
that
one
of
*NL*
those
days
the
upper
lodgers
would
look
out
at
their
doors
and
find
*NL*
themselves
without
the
means
of
coming
down
,
--
to
a
set
of
chambers
on
*NL*
the
top
floor
.
MR.
POCKET
,
JUN.
,
was
painted
on
the
door
,
and
there
was
*NL*
a
label
on
the
letter-box
,
``
Return
shortly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
hardly
thought
you
'd
come
so
soon
,
''
Mr.
Wemmick
explained
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
want
me
any
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
keep
the
cash
,
''
Mr.
Wemmick
observed
,
``
we
shall
most
likely
meet
*NL*
pretty
often
.
Good
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
out
my
hand
,
and
Mr.
Wemmick
at
first
looked
at
it
as
if
he
*NL*
thought
I
wanted
something
.
Then
he
looked
at
me
,
and
said
,
correcting
*NL*
himself
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
!
Yes
.
You
're
in
the
habit
of
shaking
hands
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
rather
confused
,
thinking
it
must
be
out
of
the
London
fashion
,
*NL*
but
said
yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
got
so
out
of
it
!
''
said
Mr.
Wemmick
,
--
``
except
at
last
.
Very
*NL*
glad
,
I
'm
sure
,
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
Good
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
shaken
hands
and
he
was
gone
,
I
opened
the
staircase
window
*NL*
and
had
nearly
beheaded
myself
,
for
,
the
lines
had
rotted
away
,
and
it
*NL*
came
down
like
the
guillotine
.
Happily
it
was
so
quick
that
I
had
not
*NL*
put
my
head
out
.
After
this
escape
,
I
was
content
to
take
a
foggy
view
*NL*
of
the
Inn
through
the
window
's
encrusting
dirt
,
and
to
stand
dolefully
*NL*
looking
out
,
saying
to
myself
that
London
was
decidedly
overrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pocket
,
Junior
's
,
idea
of
Shortly
was
not
mine
,
for
I
had
nearly
*NL*
maddened
myself
with
looking
out
for
half
an
hour
,
and
had
written
*NL*
my
name
with
my
finger
several
times
in
the
dirt
of
every
pane
in
the
*NL*
window
,
before
I
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
.
Gradually
there
arose
*NL*
before
me
the
hat
,
head
,
neckcloth
,
waistcoat
,
trousers
,
boots
,
of
a
*NL*
member
of
society
of
about
my
own
standing
.
He
had
a
paper-bag
under
*NL*
each
arm
and
a
pottle
of
strawberries
in
one
hand
,
and
was
out
of
*NL*
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Pip
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Pocket
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
I
am
extremely
sorry
;
but
I
knew
there
was
a
*NL*
coach
from
your
part
of
the
country
at
midday
,
and
I
thought
you
would
*NL*
come
by
that
one
.
The
fact
is
,
I
have
been
out
on
your
account
,
--
not
*NL*
that
that
is
any
excuse
,
--
for
I
thought
,
coming
from
the
country
,
you
*NL*
might
like
a
little
fruit
after
dinner
,
and
I
went
to
Covent
Garden
*NL*
Market
to
get
it
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
reason
that
I
had
,
I
felt
as
if
my
eyes
would
start
out
of
my
*NL*
head
.
I
acknowledged
his
attention
incoherently
,
and
began
to
think
this
*NL*
was
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
Mr.
Pocket
,
Junior
.
``
This
door
sticks
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
fast
making
jam
of
his
fruit
by
wrestling
with
the
door
while
*NL*
the
paper-bags
were
under
his
arms
,
I
begged
him
to
allow
me
to
hold
*NL*
them
.
He
relinquished
them
with
an
agreeable
smile
,
and
combated
with
*NL*
the
door
as
if
it
were
a
wild
beast
.
It
yielded
so
suddenly
at
last
,
*NL*
that
he
staggered
back
upon
me
,
and
I
staggered
back
upon
the
opposite
*NL*
door
,
and
we
both
laughed
.
But
still
I
felt
as
if
my
eyes
must
start
out
*NL*
of
my
head
,
and
as
if
this
must
be
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
come
in
,
''
said
Mr.
Pocket
,
Junior
.
``
Allow
me
to
lead
the
way
.
I
am
*NL*
rather
bare
here
,
but
I
hope
you
'll
be
able
to
make
out
tolerably
well
*NL*
till
Monday
.
My
father
thought
you
would
get
on
more
agreeably
through
*NL*
to-morrow
with
me
than
with
him
,
and
might
like
to
take
a
walk
about
*NL*
London
.
I
am
sure
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
show
London
to
you
.
As
to
our
*NL*
table
,
you
wo
n't
find
that
bad
,
I
hope
,
for
it
will
be
supplied
from
our
*NL*
coffee-house
here
,
and
-LRB-
it
is
only
right
I
should
add
-RRB-
at
your
expense
,
*NL*
such
being
Mr.
Jaggers
's
directions
.
As
to
our
lodging
,
it
's
not
by
*NL*
any
means
splendid
,
because
I
have
my
own
bread
to
earn
,
and
my
father
*NL*
has
n't
anything
to
give
me
,
and
I
should
n't
be
willing
to
take
it
,
if
he
*NL*
had
.
This
is
our
sitting-room
,
--
just
such
chairs
and
tables
and
carpet
*NL*
and
so
forth
,
you
see
,
as
they
could
spare
from
home
.
You
must
n't
give
*NL*
me
credit
for
the
tablecloth
and
spoons
and
castors
,
because
they
come
*NL*
for
you
from
the
coffee-house
.
This
is
my
little
bedroom
;
rather
musty
,
*NL*
but
Barnard
's
is
musty
.
This
is
your
bedroom
;
the
furniture
's
hired
for
*NL*
the
occasion
,
but
I
trust
it
will
answer
the
purpose
;
if
you
should
want
*NL*
anything
,
I
'll
go
and
fetch
it
.
The
chambers
are
retired
,
and
we
shall
*NL*
be
alone
together
,
but
we
sha
n't
fight
,
I
dare
say
.
But
dear
me
,
I
beg
*NL*
your
pardon
,
you
're
holding
the
fruit
all
this
time
.
Pray
let
me
take
*NL*
these
bags
from
you
.
I
am
quite
ashamed

*NL*
*NL*
As
I
stood
opposite
to
Mr.
Pocket
,
Junior
,
delivering
him
the
bags
,
One
,
*NL*
Two
,
I
saw
the
starting
appearance
come
into
his
own
eyes
that
I
knew
to
*NL*
be
in
mine
,
and
he
said
,
falling
back
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
bless
me
,
you
're
the
prowling
boy
!

Chapter
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
The
pale
young
gentleman
and
I
stood
contemplating
one
another
in
*NL*
Barnard
's
Inn
,
until
we
both
burst
out
laughing
.
``
The
idea
of
its
*NL*
being
you
!
''
said
he
.
``
The
idea
of
its
being
you

said
I.
And
then
we
*NL*
contemplated
one
another
afresh
,
and
laughed
again
.
``
Well
!
''
said
the
*NL*
pale
young
gentleman
,
reaching
out
his
hand
good-humoredly
,
``
it
's
all
*NL*
over
now
,
I
hope

and
it
will
be
magnanimous
in
you
if
you
'll
forgive
me
*NL*
for
having
knocked
you
about
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
derived
from
this
speech
that
Mr.
Herbert
Pocket
-LRB-
for
Herbert
was
the
*NL*
pale
young
gentleman
's
name
-RRB-
still
rather
confounded
his
intention
with
*NL*
his
execution
.
But
I
made
a
modest
reply
,
and
we
shook
hands
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
n't
come
into
your
good
fortune

that
time

said
Herbert
*NL*
Pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
he
acquiesced
:
``
I
heard
it
had
happened
very
lately

I
was
rather
*NL*
on
the
lookout
for
good
fortune
then

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Miss
Havisham
had
sent
for

to

But
she
could
n't

at

did

*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
polite
to
remark
that
I
was
surprised
to
hear
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
taste

''
said
Herbert
,
laughing
,
``

a
fact

Yes

me

come
out

I
*NL*
suppose

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

I
asked

with
sudden
gravity

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
arranging
his
fruit
in
plates
while
we
talked
,
which
divided
his
*NL*
attention

was
the
cause
of
his
having
made
this
lapse
of
a
word

*NL*
``
Affianced

he
explained
,
still
busy
with
the
fruit

``

Any

*NL*
``
How

burst

out

and
has
*NL*
her
confidence
when
nobody
else
has
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
bringing
me
-LRB-
I
felt
-RRB-
towards
dangerous
ground
.
I
answered
with
*NL*
a
constraint
I
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
,
that
I
had
seen
Mr.
Jaggers
*NL*
in
Miss
Havisham
's
house
on
the
very
day
of
our
combat
,
but
never
at
any
*NL*
other
time
,
and
that
I
believed
he
had
no
recollection
of
having
ever
*NL*
seen
me
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
so
obliging
as
to
suggest
my
father
for
your
tutor
,
and
he
*NL*
called
on
my
father
to
propose
it
.
Of
course
he
knew
about
my
father
*NL*
from
his
connection
with
Miss
Havisham
.
My
father
is
Miss
Havisham
's
*NL*
cousin
;
not
that
that
implies
familiar
intercourse
between
them
,
for
he
*NL*
is
a
bad
courtier
and
will
not
propitiate
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
Pocket
had
a
frank
and
easy
way
with
him
that
was
very
taking
.
*NL*
I
had
never
seen
any
one
then
,
and
I
have
never
seen
any
one
since
,
*NL*
who
more
strongly
expressed
to
me
,
in
every
look
and
tone
,
a
natural
*NL*
incapacity
to
do
anything
secret
and
mean
.
There
was
something
*NL*
wonderfully
hopeful
about
his
general
air
,
and
something
that
at
the
*NL*
same
time
whispered
to
me
he
would
never
be
very
successful
or
rich
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
this
was
.
I
became
imbued
with
the
notion
on
that
first
*NL*
occasion
before
we
sat
down
to
dinner
,
but
I
can
not
define
by
what
*NL*
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
a
pale
young
gentleman
,
and
had
a
certain
conquered
languor
*NL*
about
him
in
the
midst
of
his
spirits
and
briskness
,
that
did
not
seem
*NL*
indicative
of
natural
strength
.
He
had
not
a
handsome
face
,
but
it
was
*NL*
better
than
handsome
:
being
extremely
amiable
and
cheerful
.
His
figure
*NL*
was
a
little
ungainly
,
as
in
the
days
when
my
knuckles
had
taken
such
*NL*
liberties
with
it
,
but
it
looked
as
if
it
would
always
be
light
and
*NL*
young
.
Whether
Mr.
Trabb
's
local
work
would
have
sat
more
gracefully
on
*NL*
him
than
on
me
,
may
be
a
question
;
but
I
am
conscious
that
he
carried
*NL*
off
his
rather
old
clothes
much
better
than
I
carried
off
my
new
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
so
communicative
,
I
felt
that
reserve
on
my
part
would
be
a
*NL*
bad
return
unsuited
to
our
years
.
I
therefore
told
him
my
small
story
,
*NL*
and
laid
stress
on
my
being
forbidden
to
inquire
who
my
benefactor
was
.
*NL*
I
further
mentioned
that
as
I
had
been
brought
up
a
blacksmith
in
a
*NL*
country
place
,
and
knew
very
little
of
the
ways
of
politeness
,
I
would
*NL*
take
it
as
a
great
kindness
in
him
if
he
would
give
me
a
hint
whenever
*NL*
he
saw
me
at
a
loss
or
going
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
pleasure
,
''
said
he
,
``
though
I
venture
to
prophesy
that
you
'll
want
*NL*
very
few
hints
.
I
dare
say
we
shall
be
often
together
,
and
I
should
like
*NL*
to
banish
any
needless
restraint
between
us
.
Will
you
do
me
the
favour
*NL*
to
begin
at
once
to
call
me
by
my
Christian
name
,
Herbert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
and
said
I
would
.
I
informed
him
in
exchange
that
my
*NL*
Christian
name
was
Philip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
take
to
Philip
,
''
said
he
,
smiling
,
``
for
it
sounds
like
a
moral
*NL*
boy
out
of
the
spelling-book
,
who
was
so
lazy
that
he
fell
into
a
pond
,
*NL*
or
so
fat
that
he
could
n't
see
out
of
his
eyes
,
or
so
avaricious
that
*NL*
he
locked
up
his
cake
till
the
mice
ate
it
,
or
so
determined
to
go
a
*NL*
bird
's
-
nesting
that
he
got
himself
eaten
by
bears
who
lived
handy
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
.
I
tell
you
what
I
should
like
.
We
are
so
harmonious
,
and
*NL*
you
have
been
a
blacksmith
,
--
would
you
mind
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
mind
anything
that
you
propose
,
''
I
answered
,
``
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
Handel
for
a
familiar
name
?
There
's
a
charming
piece
of
*NL*
music
by
Handel
,
called
the
Harmonious
Blacksmith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
it
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
my
dear
Handel
,
''
said
he
,
turning
round
as
the
door
opened
,
*NL*
``
here
is
the
dinner
,
and
I
must
beg
of
you
to
take
the
top
of
the
table
,
*NL*
because
the
dinner
is
of
your
providing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
would
not
hear
of
,
so
he
took
the
top
,
and
I
faced
him
.
It
was
a
*NL*
nice
little
dinner
,
--
seemed
to
me
then
a
very
Lord
Mayor
's
Feast
,
--
and
*NL*
it
acquired
additional
relish
from
being
eaten
under
those
independent
*NL*
circumstances
,
with
no
old
people
by
,
and
with
London
all
around
us
.
*NL*
This
again
was
heightened
by
a
certain
gypsy
character
that
set
the
*NL*
banquet
off
;
for
while
the
table
was
,
as
Mr.
Pumblechook
might
have
*NL*
said
,
the
lap
of
luxury
,
--
being
entirely
furnished
forth
from
the
*NL*
coffee-house
,
--
the
circumjacent
region
of
sitting-room
was
of
a
*NL*
comparatively
pastureless
and
shifty
character
;
imposing
on
the
waiter
*NL*
the
wandering
habits
of
putting
the
covers
on
the
floor
-LRB-
where
he
*NL*
fell
over
them
-RRB-
,
the
melted
butter
in
the
arm-chair
,
the
bread
on
the
*NL*
bookshelves
,
the
cheese
in
the
coal-scuttle
,
and
the
boiled
fowl
into
my
*NL*
bed
in
the
next
room
,
--
where
I
found
much
of
its
parsley
and
butter
in
*NL*
a
state
of
congelation
when
I
retired
for
the
night
.
All
this
made
the
*NL*
feast
delightful
,
and
when
the
waiter
was
not
there
to
watch
me
,
my
*NL*
pleasure
was
without
alloy
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
made
some
progress
in
the
dinner
,
when
I
reminded
Herbert
of
his
*NL*
promise
to
tell
me
about
Miss
Havisham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
he
replied
.
``
I
'll
redeem
it
at
once
.
Let
me
introduce
the
topic
,
*NL*
Handel
,
by
mentioning
that
in
London
it
is
not
the
custom
to
put
the
*NL*
knife
in
the
mouth
,
--
for
fear
of
accidents
,
--
and
that
while
the
fork
is
*NL*
reserved
for
that
use
,
it
is
not
put
further
in
than
necessary
.
It
is
*NL*
scarcely
worth
mentioning
,
only
it
's
as
well
to
do
as
other
people
do
.
*NL*
Also
,
the
spoon
is
not
generally
used
over-hand
,
but
under
.
This
has
*NL*
two
advantages
.
You
get
at
your
mouth
better
-LRB-
which
after
all
is
the
*NL*
object
-RRB-
,
and
you
save
a
good
deal
of
the
attitude
of
opening
oysters
,
on
*NL*
the
part
of
the
right
elbow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
offered
these
friendly
suggestions
in
such
a
lively
way
,
that
we
both
*NL*
laughed
and
I
scarcely
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
concerning
Miss
Havisham
.
Miss
Havisham
,
you
must
*NL*
know
,
was
a
spoilt
child
.
Her
mother
died
when
she
was
a
baby
,
and
her
*NL*
father
denied
her
nothing
.
Her
father
was
a
country
gentleman
down
in
*NL*
your
part
of
the
world
,
and
was
a
brewer
.
I
do
n't
know
why
it
should
*NL*
be
a
crack
thing
to
be
a
brewer
;
but
it
is
indisputable
that
while
you
*NL*
can
not
possibly
be
genteel
and
bake
,
you
may
be
as
genteel
as
never
was
*NL*
and
brew
.
You
see
it
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
a
gentleman
may
not
keep
a
public-house
;
may
he
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
on
any
account
,
''
returned
Herbert
;
``
but
a
public-house
may
keep
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
Well
!
Mr.
Havisham
was
very
rich
and
very
proud
.
So
was
his
*NL*
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Havisham
was
an
only
child
?
''
I
hazarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
moment
,
I
am
coming
to
that
.
No
,
she
was
not
an
only
child
;
*NL*
she
had
a
half-brother
.
Her
father
privately
married
again
--
his
cook
,
I
*NL*
rather
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
he
was
proud
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
Handel
,
so
he
was
.
He
married
his
second
wife
privately
,
*NL*
because
he
was
proud
,
and
in
course
of
time
she
died
.
When
she
was
dead
,
*NL*
I
apprehend
he
first
told
his
daughter
what
he
had
done
,
and
then
*NL*
the
son
became
a
part
of
the
family
,
residing
in
the
house
you
are
*NL*
acquainted
with
.
As
the
son
grew
a
young
man
,
he
turned
out
riotous
,
*NL*
extravagant
,
undutiful
,
--
altogether
bad
.
At
last
his
father
disinherited
*NL*
him
;
but
he
softened
when
he
was
dying
,
and
left
him
well
off
,
though
*NL*
not
nearly
so
well
off
as
Miss
Havisham
.
--
Take
another
glass
of
wine
,
*NL*
and
excuse
my
mentioning
that
society
as
a
body
does
not
expect
one
*NL*
to
be
so
strictly
conscientious
in
emptying
one
's
glass
,
as
to
turn
it
*NL*
bottom
upwards
with
the
rim
on
one
's
nose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
doing
this
,
in
an
excess
of
attention
to
his
recital
.
I
*NL*
thanked
him
,
and
apologized
.
He
said
,
``
Not
at
all
,
''
and
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Havisham
was
now
an
heiress
,
and
you
may
suppose
was
looked
after
*NL*
as
a
great
match
.
Her
half-brother
had
now
ample
means
again
,
but
what
*NL*
with
debts
and
what
with
new
madness
wasted
them
most
fearfully
again
.
*NL*
There
were
stronger
differences
between
him
and
her
than
there
had
been
*NL*
between
him
and
his
father
,
and
it
is
suspected
that
he
cherished
a
deep
*NL*
and
mortal
grudge
against
her
as
having
influenced
the
father
's
anger
.
*NL*
Now
,
I
come
to
the
cruel
part
of
the
story
,
--
merely
breaking
off
,
my
*NL*
dear
Handel
,
to
remark
that
a
dinner-napkin
will
not
go
into
a
tumbler
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Why
I
was
trying
to
pack
mine
into
my
tumbler
,
I
am
wholly
unable
to
*NL*
say
.
I
only
know
that
I
found
myself
,
with
a
perseverance
worthy
of
a
*NL*
much
better
cause
,
making
the
most
strenuous
exertions
to
compress
it
*NL*
within
those
limits
.
Again
I
thanked
him
and
apologized
,
and
again
he
*NL*
said
in
the
cheerfullest
manner
,
``
Not
at
all
,
I
am
sure
!
''
and
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
appeared
upon
the
scene
--
say
at
the
races
,
or
the
public
*NL*
balls
,
or
anywhere
else
you
like
--
a
certain
man
,
who
made
love
to
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
.
I
never
saw
him
-LRB-
for
this
happened
five-and-twenty
years
ago
,
*NL*
before
you
and
I
were
,
Handel
-RRB-
,
but
I
have
heard
my
father
mention
that
*NL*
he
was
a
showy
man
,
and
the
kind
of
man
for
the
purpose
.
But
that
he
was
*NL*
not
to
be
,
without
ignorance
or
prejudice
,
mistaken
for
a
gentleman
,
my
*NL*
father
most
strongly
asseverates
;
because
it
is
a
principle
of
his
that
*NL*
no
man
who
was
not
a
true
gentleman
at
heart
ever
was
,
since
the
world
*NL*
began
,
a
true
gentleman
in
manner
.
He
says
,
no
varnish
can
hide
the
*NL*
grain
of
the
wood
;
and
that
the
more
varnish
you
put
on
,
the
more
the
*NL*
grain
will
express
itself
.
Well
!
This
man
pursued
Miss
Havisham
closely
,
*NL*
and
professed
to
be
devoted
to
her
.
I
believe
she
had
not
shown
much
*NL*
susceptibility
up
to
that
time
;
but
all
the
susceptibility
she
possessed
*NL*
certainly
came
out
then
,
and
she
passionately
loved
him
.
There
is
no
*NL*
doubt
that
she
perfectly
idolized
him
.
He
practised
on
her
affection
in
*NL*
that
systematic
way
,
that
he
got
great
sums
of
money
from
her
,
and
he
*NL*
induced
her
to
buy
her
brother
out
of
a
share
in
the
brewery
-LRB-
which
had
*NL*
been
weakly
left
him
by
his
father
-RRB-
at
an
immense
price
,
on
the
plea
*NL*
that
when
he
was
her
husband
he
must
hold
and
manage
it
all
.
Your
*NL*
guardian
was
not
at
that
time
in
Miss
Havisham
's
counsels
,
and
she
was
*NL*
too
haughty
and
too
much
in
love
to
be
advised
by
any
one
.
Her
relations
*NL*
were
poor
and
scheming
,
with
the
exception
of
my
father
;
he
was
poor
*NL*
enough
,
but
not
time-serving
or
jealous
.
The
only
independent
one
among
*NL*
them
,
he
warned
her
that
she
was
doing
too
much
for
this
man
,
and
*NL*
was
placing
herself
too
unreservedly
in
his
power
.
She
took
the
first
*NL*
opportunity
of
angrily
ordering
my
father
out
of
the
house
,
in
his
*NL*
presence
,
and
my
father
has
never
seen
her
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
of
her
having
said
,
``
Matthew
will
come
and
see
me
at
last
when
*NL*
I
am
laid
dead
upon
that
table
;
''
and
I
asked
Herbert
whether
his
father
*NL*
was
so
inveterate
against
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
that
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
she
charged
him
,
in
the
presence
of
her
*NL*
intended
husband
,
with
being
disappointed
in
the
hope
of
fawning
upon
*NL*
her
for
his
own
advancement
,
and
,
if
he
were
to
go
to
her
now
,
it
would
*NL*
look
true
--
even
to
him
--
and
even
to
her
.
To
return
to
the
man
and
make
*NL*
an
end
of
him
.
The
marriage
day
was
fixed
,
the
wedding
dresses
were
*NL*
bought
,
the
wedding
tour
was
planned
out
,
the
wedding
guests
were
*NL*
invited
.
The
day
came
,
but
not
the
bridegroom
.
He
wrote
her
a
letter
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
she
received
,
''
I
struck
in
,
``
when
she
was
dressing
for
her
*NL*
marriage
?
At
twenty
minutes
to
nine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
hour
and
minute
,
''
said
Herbert
,
nodding
,
``
at
which
she
*NL*
afterwards
stopped
all
the
clocks
.
What
was
in
it
,
further
than
that
*NL*
it
most
heartlessly
broke
the
marriage
off
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
because
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
.
When
she
recovered
from
a
bad
illness
that
she
had
,
she
*NL*
laid
the
whole
place
waste
,
as
you
have
seen
it
,
and
she
has
never
since
*NL*
looked
upon
the
light
of
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
the
story
?
''
I
asked
,
after
considering
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
know
of
it
;
and
indeed
I
only
know
so
much
,
through
piecing
it
*NL*
out
for
myself
;
for
my
father
always
avoids
it
,
and
,
even
when
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
invited
me
to
go
there
,
told
me
no
more
of
it
than
it
was
*NL*
absolutely
requisite
I
should
understand
.
But
I
have
forgotten
one
*NL*
thing
.
It
has
been
supposed
that
the
man
to
whom
she
gave
her
misplaced
*NL*
confidence
acted
throughout
in
concert
with
her
half-brother
;
that
it
*NL*
was
a
conspiracy
between
them
;
and
that
they
shared
the
profits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
he
did
n't
marry
her
and
get
all
the
property
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
have
been
married
already
,
and
her
cruel
mortification
may
have
*NL*
been
a
part
of
her
half-brother
's
scheme
,
''
said
Herbert
.
``
Mind
!
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
became
of
the
two
men
?
''
I
asked
,
after
again
considering
the
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
fell
into
deeper
shame
and
degradation
--
if
there
can
be
*NL*
deeper
--
and
ruin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
alive
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
just
now
that
Estella
was
not
related
to
Miss
Havisham
,
but
*NL*
adopted
.
When
adopted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
There
has
always
been
an
Estella
,
since
*NL*
I
have
heard
of
a
Miss
Havisham
.
I
know
no
more
.
And
now
,
Handel
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
finally
throwing
off
the
story
as
it
were
,
``
there
is
a
perfectly
*NL*
open
understanding
between
us
.
All
that
I
know
about
Miss
Havisham
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
all
that
I
know
,
''
I
retorted
,
``
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fully
believe
it
.
So
there
can
be
no
competition
or
perplexity
*NL*
between
you
and
me
.
And
as
to
the
condition
on
which
you
hold
your
*NL*
advancement
in
life
,
--
namely
,
that
you
are
not
to
inquire
or
discuss
to
*NL*
whom
you
owe
it
,
--
you
may
be
very
sure
that
it
will
never
be
encroached
*NL*
upon
,
or
even
approached
,
by
me
,
or
by
any
one
belonging
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
,
he
said
this
with
so
much
delicacy
,
that
I
felt
the
subject
*NL*
done
with
,
even
though
I
should
be
under
his
father
's
roof
for
years
and
*NL*
years
to
come
.
Yet
he
said
it
with
so
much
meaning
,
too
,
that
I
felt
*NL*
he
as
perfectly
understood
Miss
Havisham
to
be
my
benefactress
,
as
I
*NL*
understood
the
fact
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
,
that
he
had
led
up
to
the
theme
for
*NL*
the
purpose
of
clearing
it
out
of
our
way
;
but
we
were
so
much
the
*NL*
lighter
and
easier
for
having
broached
it
,
that
I
now
perceived
this
*NL*
to
be
the
case
.
We
were
very
gay
and
sociable
,
and
I
asked
him
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
conversation
,
what
he
was
?
He
replied
,
``
A
capitalist
,
--
an
*NL*
Insurer
of
Ships
.
''
I
suppose
he
saw
me
glancing
about
the
room
in
search
*NL*
of
some
tokens
of
Shipping
,
or
capital
,
for
he
added
,
``
In
the
City
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
grand
ideas
of
the
wealth
and
importance
of
Insurers
of
Ships
in
*NL*
the
City
,
and
I
began
to
think
with
awe
of
having
laid
a
young
Insurer
*NL*
on
his
back
,
blackened
his
enterprising
eye
,
and
cut
his
responsible
*NL*
head
open
.
But
again
there
came
upon
me
,
for
my
relief
,
that
odd
*NL*
impression
that
Herbert
Pocket
would
never
be
very
successful
or
rich
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
rest
satisfied
with
merely
employing
my
capital
in
insuring
*NL*
ships
.
I
shall
buy
up
some
good
Life
Assurance
shares
,
and
cut
into
the
*NL*
Direction
.
I
shall
also
do
a
little
in
the
mining
way
.
None
of
these
*NL*
things
will
interfere
with
my
chartering
a
few
thousand
tons
on
my
own
*NL*
account
.
I
think
I
shall
trade
,
''
said
he
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
``
to
*NL*
the
East
Indies
,
for
silks
,
shawls
,
spices
,
dyes
,
drugs
,
and
precious
*NL*
woods
.
It
's
an
interesting
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
profits
are
large
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tremendous
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wavered
again
,
and
began
to
think
here
were
greater
expectations
than
*NL*
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
shall
trade
,
also
,
''
said
he
,
putting
his
thumbs
in
his
*NL*
waist-coat
pockets
,
``
to
the
West
Indies
,
for
sugar
,
tobacco
,
and
rum
.
*NL*
Also
to
Ceylon
,
specially
for
elephants
'
tusks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
want
a
good
many
ships
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
perfect
fleet
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
overpowered
by
the
magnificence
of
these
transactions
,
I
asked
him
*NL*
where
the
ships
he
insured
mostly
traded
to
at
present
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
begun
insuring
yet
,
''
he
replied
.
``
I
am
looking
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
,
that
pursuit
seemed
more
in
keeping
with
Barnard
's
Inn
.
I
said
*NL*
-LRB-
in
a
tone
of
conviction
-RRB-
,
``
Ah-h
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
am
in
a
counting-house
,
and
looking
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
a
counting-house
profitable
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
--
do
you
mean
to
the
young
fellow
who
's
in
it
?
''
he
asked
,
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
n-no
;
not
to
me
.
''
He
said
this
with
the
air
of
one
carefully
*NL*
reckoning
up
and
striking
a
balance
.
``
Not
directly
profitable
.
That
is
,
*NL*
it
does
n't
pay
me
anything
,
and
I
have
to
--
keep
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
certainly
had
not
a
profitable
appearance
,
and
I
shook
my
head
as
*NL*
if
I
would
imply
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
lay
by
much
accumulative
*NL*
capital
from
such
a
source
of
income
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
thing
is
,
''
said
Herbert
Pocket
,
``
that
you
look
about
you
.
*NL*
That
's
the
grand
thing
.
You
are
in
a
counting-house
,
you
know
,
and
you
*NL*
look
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
me
as
a
singular
implication
that
you
could
n't
be
out
of
a
*NL*
counting-house
,
you
know
,
and
look
about
you
;
but
I
silently
deferred
to
*NL*
his
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
time
comes
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
when
you
see
your
opening
.
And
you
*NL*
go
in
,
and
you
swoop
upon
it
and
you
make
your
capital
,
and
then
there
*NL*
you
are
!
When
you
have
once
made
your
capital
,
you
have
nothing
to
do
*NL*
but
employ
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
very
like
his
way
of
conducting
that
encounter
in
the
garden
;
*NL*
very
like
.
His
manner
of
bearing
his
poverty
,
too
,
exactly
corresponded
*NL*
to
his
manner
of
bearing
that
defeat
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
he
took
all
*NL*
blows
and
buffets
now
with
just
the
same
air
as
he
had
taken
mine
*NL*
then
.
It
was
evident
that
he
had
nothing
around
him
but
the
simplest
*NL*
necessaries
,
for
everything
that
I
remarked
upon
turned
out
to
have
been
*NL*
sent
in
on
my
account
from
the
coffee-house
or
somewhere
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
having
already
made
his
fortune
in
his
own
mind
,
he
was
so
*NL*
unassuming
with
it
that
I
felt
quite
grateful
to
him
for
not
being
*NL*
puffed
up
.
It
was
a
pleasant
addition
to
his
naturally
pleasant
ways
,
*NL*
and
we
got
on
famously
.
In
the
evening
we
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
*NL*
streets
,
and
went
half-price
to
the
Theatre
;
and
next
day
we
went
to
*NL*
church
at
Westminster
Abbey
,
and
in
the
afternoon
we
walked
in
the
*NL*
Parks
;
and
I
wondered
who
shod
all
the
horses
there
,
and
wished
Joe
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
moderate
computation
,
it
was
many
months
,
that
Sunday
,
since
I
had
*NL*
left
Joe
and
Biddy
.
The
space
interposed
between
myself
and
them
partook
*NL*
of
that
expansion
,
and
our
marshes
were
any
distance
off
.
That
I
could
*NL*
have
been
at
our
old
church
in
my
old
church-going
clothes
,
on
the
very
*NL*
last
Sunday
that
ever
was
,
seemed
a
combination
of
impossibilities
,
*NL*
geographical
and
social
,
solar
and
lunar
.
Yet
in
the
London
streets
so
*NL*
crowded
with
people
and
so
brilliantly
lighted
in
the
dusk
of
evening
,
*NL*
there
were
depressing
hints
of
reproaches
for
that
I
had
put
the
poor
*NL*
old
kitchen
at
home
so
far
away
;
and
in
the
dead
of
night
,
the
footsteps
*NL*
of
some
incapable
impostor
of
a
porter
mooning
about
Barnard
's
Inn
,
*NL*
under
pretence
of
watching
it
,
fell
hollow
on
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Monday
morning
at
a
quarter
before
nine
,
Herbert
went
to
*NL*
the
counting-house
to
report
himself
,
--
to
look
about
him
,
too
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
--
and
I
bore
him
company
.
He
was
to
come
away
in
an
hour
or
*NL*
two
to
attend
me
to
Hammersmith
,
and
I
was
to
wait
about
for
him
.
It
*NL*
appeared
to
me
that
the
eggs
from
which
young
Insurers
were
hatched
were
*NL*
incubated
in
dust
and
heat
,
like
the
eggs
of
ostriches
,
judging
from
the
*NL*
places
to
which
those
incipient
giants
repaired
on
a
Monday
morning
.
Nor
*NL*
did
the
counting-house
where
Herbert
assisted
,
show
in
my
eyes
as
at
*NL*
all
a
good
Observatory
;
being
a
back
second
floor
up
a
yard
,
of
a
grimy
*NL*
presence
in
all
particulars
,
and
with
a
look
into
another
back
second
*NL*
floor
,
rather
than
a
look
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
about
until
it
was
noon
,
and
I
went
upon
`
Change
,
and
I
saw
*NL*
fluey
men
sitting
there
under
the
bills
about
shipping
,
whom
I
took
to
*NL*
be
great
merchants
,
though
I
could
n't
understand
why
they
should
all
be
*NL*
out
of
spirits
.
When
Herbert
came
,
we
went
and
had
lunch
at
a
celebrated
*NL*
house
which
I
then
quite
venerated
,
but
now
believe
to
have
been
the
*NL*
most
abject
superstition
in
Europe
,
and
where
I
could
not
help
noticing
,
*NL*
even
then
,
that
there
was
much
more
gravy
on
the
tablecloths
and
knives
*NL*
and
waiters
'
clothes
,
than
in
the
steaks
.
This
collation
disposed
of
at
*NL*
a
moderate
price
-LRB-
considering
the
grease
,
which
was
not
charged
for
-RRB-
,
we
*NL*
went
back
to
Barnard
's
Inn
and
got
my
little
portmanteau
,
and
then
took
*NL*
coach
for
Hammersmith
.
We
arrived
there
at
two
or
three
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
,
and
had
very
little
way
to
walk
to
Mr.
Pocket
's
house
.
*NL*
Lifting
the
latch
of
a
gate
,
we
passed
direct
into
a
little
garden
*NL*
overlooking
the
river
,
where
Mr.
Pocket
's
children
were
playing
*NL*
about
.
And
unless
I
deceive
myself
on
a
point
where
my
interests
or
*NL*
prepossessions
are
certainly
not
concerned
,
I
saw
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocket
's
children
were
not
growing
up
or
being
brought
up
,
but
were
*NL*
tumbling
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocket
was
sitting
on
a
garden
chair
under
a
tree
,
reading
,
with
*NL*
her
legs
upon
another
garden
chair
;
and
Mrs.
Pocket
's
two
nurse-maids
*NL*
were
looking
about
them
while
the
children
played
.
``
Mamma
,
''
said
*NL*
Herbert
,
``
this
is
young
Mr.
Pip
.
''
Upon
which
Mrs.
Pocket
received
me
*NL*
with
an
appearance
of
amiable
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Alick
and
Miss
Jane
,
''
cried
one
of
the
nurses
to
two
of
the
*NL*
children
,
``
if
you
go
a
bouncing
up
against
them
bushes
you
'll
fall
over
*NL*
into
the
river
and
be
drownded
,
and
what
'll
your
pa
say
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
this
nurse
picked
up
Mrs.
Pocket
's
handkerchief
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
If
that
do
n't
make
six
times
you
've
dropped
it
,
Mum
!
''
Upon
which
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocket
laughed
and
said
,
``
Thank
you
,
Flopson
,
''
and
settling
herself
*NL*
in
one
chair
only
,
resumed
her
book
.
Her
countenance
immediately
assumed
*NL*
a
knitted
and
intent
expression
as
if
she
had
been
reading
for
a
week
,
*NL*
but
before
she
could
have
read
half
a
dozen
lines
,
she
fixed
her
eyes
*NL*
upon
me
,
and
said
,
``
I
hope
your
mamma
is
quite
well
?
''
This
unexpected
*NL*
inquiry
put
me
into
such
a
difficulty
that
I
began
saying
in
the
*NL*
absurdest
way
that
if
there
had
been
any
such
person
I
had
no
doubt
she
*NL*
would
have
been
quite
well
and
would
have
been
very
much
obliged
and
*NL*
would
have
sent
her
compliments
,
when
the
nurse
came
to
my
rescue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
she
cried
,
picking
up
the
pocket-handkerchief
,
``
if
that
do
n't
*NL*
make
seven
times
!
What
ARE
you
a
doing
of
this
afternoon
,
Mum
!
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocket
received
her
property
,
at
first
with
a
look
of
unutterable
*NL*
surprise
as
if
she
had
never
seen
it
before
,
and
then
with
a
laugh
of
*NL*
recognition
,
and
said
,
``
Thank
you
,
Flopson
,
''
and
forgot
me
,
and
went
on
*NL*
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
,
now
I
had
leisure
to
count
them
,
that
there
were
no
fewer
than
*NL*
six
little
Pockets
present
,
in
various
stages
of
tumbling
up
.
I
had
*NL*
scarcely
arrived
at
the
total
when
a
seventh
was
heard
,
as
in
the
region
*NL*
of
air
,
wailing
dolefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
ai
n't
Baby
!
''
said
Flopson
,
appearing
to
think
it
most
*NL*
surprising
.
``
Make
haste
up
,
Millers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Millers
,
who
was
the
other
nurse
,
retired
into
the
house
,
and
by
degrees
*NL*
the
child
's
wailing
was
hushed
and
stopped
,
as
if
it
were
a
young
*NL*
ventriloquist
with
something
in
its
mouth
.
Mrs.
Pocket
read
all
the
*NL*
time
,
and
I
was
curious
to
know
what
the
book
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
waiting
,
I
supposed
,
for
Mr.
Pocket
to
come
out
to
us
;
at
any
*NL*
rate
we
waited
there
,
and
so
I
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
*NL*
remarkable
family
phenomenon
that
whenever
any
of
the
children
strayed
*NL*
near
Mrs.
Pocket
in
their
play
,
they
always
tripped
themselves
up
and
*NL*
tumbled
over
her
,
--
always
very
much
to
her
momentary
astonishment
,
and
*NL*
their
own
more
enduring
lamentation
.
I
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
*NL*
this
surprising
circumstance
,
and
could
not
help
giving
my
mind
to
*NL*
speculations
about
it
,
until
by
and
by
Millers
came
down
with
the
baby
,
*NL*
which
baby
was
handed
to
Flopson
,
which
Flopson
was
handing
it
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocket
,
when
she
too
went
fairly
head
foremost
over
Mrs.
Pocket
,
baby
*NL*
and
all
,
and
was
caught
by
Herbert
and
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
me
,
Flopson
!
''
said
Mrs.
Pocket
,
looking
off
her
book
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
``
everybody
's
tumbling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
you
,
indeed
,
Mum
!
''
returned
Flopson
,
very
red
in
the
face
;
*NL*
``
what
have
you
got
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
here
,
Flopson
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
it
ai
n't
your
footstool
!
''
cried
Flopson
.
``
And
if
you
keep
it
*NL*
under
your
skirts
like
that
,
who
's
to
help
tumbling
?
Here
!
Take
the
*NL*
baby
,
Mum
,
and
give
me
your
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocket
acted
on
the
advice
,
and
inexpertly
danced
the
infant
a
*NL*
little
in
her
lap
,
while
the
other
children
played
about
it
.
This
had
*NL*
lasted
but
a
very
short
time
,
when
Mrs.
Pocket
issued
summary
orders
*NL*
that
they
were
all
to
be
taken
into
the
house
for
a
nap
.
Thus
I
made
the
*NL*
second
discovery
on
that
first
occasion
,
that
the
nurture
of
the
little
*NL*
Pockets
consisted
of
alternately
tumbling
up
and
lying
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
these
circumstances
,
when
Flopson
and
Millers
had
got
the
children
*NL*
into
the
house
,
like
a
little
flock
of
sheep
,
and
Mr.
Pocket
came
out
*NL*
of
it
to
make
my
acquaintance
,
I
was
not
much
surprised
to
find
that
Mr.
*NL*
Pocket
was
a
gentleman
with
a
rather
perplexed
expression
of
face
,
and
*NL*
with
his
very
gray
hair
disordered
on
his
head
,
as
if
he
did
n't
quite
*NL*
see
his
way
to
putting
anything
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pocket
said
he
was
glad
to
see
me
,
and
he
hoped
I
was
not
sorry
to
*NL*
see
him
.
``
For
,
I
really
am
not
,
''
he
added
,
with
his
son
's
smile
,
*NL*
``
an
alarming
personage
.
''
He
was
a
young-looking
man
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
his
perplexities
and
his
very
gray
hair
,
and
his
manner
seemed
quite
*NL*
natural
.
I
use
the
word
natural
,
in
the
sense
of
its
being
unaffected
;
*NL*
there
was
something
comic
in
his
distraught
way
,
as
though
it
would
have
*NL*
been
downright
ludicrous
but
for
his
own
perception
that
it
was
very
*NL*
near
being
so
.
When
he
had
talked
with
me
a
little
,
he
said
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocket
,
with
a
rather
anxious
contraction
of
his
eyebrows
,
which
were
*NL*
black
and
handsome
,
``
Belinda
,
I
hope
you
have
welcomed
Mr.
Pip
?
''
And
she
*NL*
looked
up
from
her
book
,
and
said
,
``
Yes
.
''
She
then
smiled
upon
me
in
an
*NL*
absent
state
of
mind
,
and
asked
me
if
I
liked
the
taste
of
orange-flower
*NL*
water
?
As
the
question
had
no
bearing
,
near
or
remote
,
on
any
foregone
*NL*
or
subsequent
transaction
,
I
consider
it
to
have
been
thrown
out
,
like
*NL*
her
previous
approaches
,
in
general
conversational
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
out
within
a
few
hours
,
and
may
mention
at
once
,
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocket
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
certain
quite
accidental
deceased
*NL*
Knight
,
who
had
invented
for
himself
a
conviction
that
his
deceased
*NL*
father
would
have
been
made
a
Baronet
but
for
somebody
's
determined
*NL*
opposition
arising
out
of
entirely
personal
motives
,
--
I
forget
whose
,
*NL*
if
I
ever
knew
,
--
the
Sovereign
's
,
the
Prime
Minister
's
,
the
Lord
*NL*
Chancellor
's
,
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
's
,
anybody
's
,
--
and
had
*NL*
tacked
himself
on
to
the
nobles
of
the
earth
in
right
of
this
quite
*NL*
supposititious
fact
.
I
believe
he
had
been
knighted
himself
for
storming
*NL*
the
English
grammar
at
the
point
of
the
pen
,
in
a
desperate
address
*NL*
engrossed
on
vellum
,
on
the
occasion
of
the
laying
of
the
first
stone
of
*NL*
some
building
or
other
,
and
for
handing
some
Royal
Personage
either
the
*NL*
trowel
or
the
mortar
.
Be
that
as
it
may
,
he
had
directed
Mrs.
Pocket
to
*NL*
be
brought
up
from
her
cradle
as
one
who
in
the
nature
of
things
*NL*
must
marry
a
title
,
and
who
was
to
be
guarded
from
the
acquisition
of
*NL*
plebeian
domestic
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
successful
a
watch
and
ward
had
been
established
over
the
young
lady
*NL*
by
this
judicious
parent
,
that
she
had
grown
up
highly
ornamental
,
but
*NL*
perfectly
helpless
and
useless
.
With
her
character
thus
happily
formed
,
*NL*
in
the
first
bloom
of
her
youth
she
had
encountered
Mr.
Pocket
:
who
was
*NL*
also
in
the
first
bloom
of
youth
,
and
not
quite
decided
whether
to
mount
*NL*
to
the
Woolsack
,
or
to
roof
himself
in
with
a
mitre
.
As
his
doing
the
*NL*
one
or
the
other
was
a
mere
question
of
time
,
he
and
Mrs.
Pocket
had
*NL*
taken
Time
by
the
forelock
-LRB-
when
,
to
judge
from
its
length
,
it
would
*NL*
seem
to
have
wanted
cutting
-RRB-
,
and
had
married
without
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
judicious
parent
.
The
judicious
parent
,
having
nothing
to
bestow
or
*NL*
withhold
but
his
blessing
,
had
handsomely
settled
that
dower
upon
them
*NL*
after
a
short
struggle
,
and
had
informed
Mr.
Pocket
that
his
wife
was
``
a
*NL*
treasure
for
a
Prince
.
''
Mr.
Pocket
had
invested
the
Prince
's
treasure
*NL*
in
the
ways
of
the
world
ever
since
,
and
it
was
supposed
to
have
brought
*NL*
him
in
but
indifferent
interest
.
Still
,
Mrs.
Pocket
was
in
general
the
*NL*
object
of
a
queer
sort
of
respectful
pity
,
because
she
had
not
married
*NL*
a
title
;
while
Mr.
Pocket
was
the
object
of
a
queer
sort
of
forgiving
*NL*
reproach
,
because
he
had
never
got
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pocket
took
me
into
the
house
and
showed
me
my
room
:
which
was
a
*NL*
pleasant
one
,
and
so
furnished
as
that
I
could
use
it
with
comfort
for
*NL*
my
own
private
sitting-room
.
He
then
knocked
at
the
doors
of
two
other
*NL*
similar
rooms
,
and
introduced
me
to
their
occupants
,
by
name
Drummle
*NL*
and
Startop
.
Drummle
,
an
old-looking
young
man
of
a
heavy
order
of
*NL*
architecture
,
was
whistling
.
Startop
,
younger
in
years
and
appearance
,
*NL*
was
reading
and
holding
his
head
,
as
if
he
thought
himself
in
danger
of
*NL*
exploding
it
with
too
strong
a
charge
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pocket
had
such
a
noticeable
air
of
being
in
somebody
*NL*
else
's
hands
,
that
I
wondered
who
really
was
in
possession
of
the
house
*NL*
and
let
them
live
there
,
until
I
found
this
unknown
power
to
be
the
*NL*
servants
.
It
was
a
smooth
way
of
going
on
,
perhaps
,
in
respect
of
saving
*NL*
trouble
;
but
it
had
the
appearance
of
being
expensive
,
for
the
servants
*NL*
felt
it
a
duty
they
owed
to
themselves
to
be
nice
in
their
eating
and
*NL*
drinking
,
and
to
keep
a
deal
of
company
downstairs
.
They
allowed
a
very
*NL*
liberal
table
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pocket
,
yet
it
always
appeared
to
me
that
*NL*
by
far
the
best
part
of
the
house
to
have
boarded
in
would
have
been
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
--
always
supposing
the
boarder
capable
of
self-defence
,
for
,
*NL*
before
I
had
been
there
a
week
,
a
neighboring
lady
with
whom
the
family
*NL*
were
personally
unacquainted
,
wrote
in
to
say
that
she
had
seen
Millers
*NL*
slapping
the
baby
.
This
greatly
distressed
Mrs.
Pocket
,
who
burst
into
*NL*
tears
on
receiving
the
note
,
and
said
that
it
was
an
extraordinary
thing
*NL*
that
the
neighbors
could
n't
mind
their
own
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
I
learnt
,
and
chiefly
from
Herbert
,
that
Mr.
Pocket
had
been
*NL*
educated
at
Harrow
and
at
Cambridge
,
where
he
had
distinguished
himself
;
*NL*
but
that
when
he
had
had
the
happiness
of
marrying
Mrs.
Pocket
very
*NL*
early
in
life
,
he
had
impaired
his
prospects
and
taken
up
the
calling
*NL*
of
a
Grinder
.
After
grinding
a
number
of
dull
blades
,
--
of
whom
it
was
*NL*
remarkable
that
their
fathers
,
when
influential
,
were
always
going
to
*NL*
help
him
to
preferment
,
but
always
forgot
to
do
it
when
the
blades
had
*NL*
left
the
Grindstone
,
--
he
had
wearied
of
that
poor
work
and
had
come
to
*NL*
London
.
Here
,
after
gradually
failing
in
loftier
hopes
,
he
had
``
read
''
*NL*
with
divers
who
had
lacked
opportunities
or
neglected
them
,
and
had
*NL*
refurbished
divers
others
for
special
occasions
,
and
had
turned
his
*NL*
acquirements
to
the
account
of
literary
compilation
and
correction
,
*NL*
and
on
such
means
,
added
to
some
very
moderate
private
resources
,
still
*NL*
maintained
the
house
I
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pocket
had
a
toady
neighbor
;
a
widow
lady
of
that
highly
*NL*
sympathetic
nature
that
she
agreed
with
everybody
,
blessed
everybody
,
*NL*
and
shed
smiles
and
tears
on
everybody
,
according
to
circumstances
.
This
*NL*
lady
's
name
was
Mrs.
Coiler
,
and
I
had
the
honor
of
taking
her
down
to
*NL*
dinner
on
the
day
of
my
installation
.
She
gave
me
to
understand
on
the
*NL*
stairs
,
that
it
was
a
blow
to
dear
Mrs.
Pocket
that
dear
Mr.
Pocket
*NL*
should
be
under
the
necessity
of
receiving
gentlemen
to
read
with
him
.
*NL*
That
did
not
extend
to
me
,
she
told
me
in
a
gush
of
love
and
confidence
*NL*
-LRB-
at
that
time
,
I
had
known
her
something
less
than
five
minutes
-RRB-
;
if
*NL*
they
were
all
like
Me
,
it
would
be
quite
another
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
dear
Mrs.
Pocket
,
''
said
Mrs.
Coiler
,
``
after
her
early
*NL*
disappointment
-LRB-
not
that
dear
Mr.
Pocket
was
to
blame
in
that
-RRB-
,
requires
*NL*
so
much
luxury
and
elegance
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
''
I
said
,
to
stop
her
,
for
I
was
afraid
she
was
going
to
*NL*
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
is
of
so
aristocratic
a
disposition
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
''
I
said
again
,
with
the
same
object
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
That
it
is
hard
,
''
said
Mrs.
Coiler
,
``
to
have
dear
Mr.
Pocket
's
time
*NL*
and
attention
diverted
from
dear
Mrs.
Pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
thinking
that
it
might
be
harder
if
the
butcher
's
time
*NL*
and
attention
were
diverted
from
dear
Mrs.
Pocket
;
but
I
said
nothing
,
*NL*
and
indeed
had
enough
to
do
in
keeping
a
bashful
watch
upon
my
company
*NL*
manners
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
to
my
knowledge
,
through
what
passed
between
Mrs.
Pocket
and
*NL*
Drummle
while
I
was
attentive
to
my
knife
and
fork
,
spoon
,
glasses
,
and
*NL*
other
instruments
of
self-destruction
,
that
Drummle
,
whose
Christian
*NL*
name
was
Bentley
,
was
actually
the
next
heir
but
one
to
a
baronetcy
.
*NL*
It
further
appeared
that
the
book
I
had
seen
Mrs.
Pocket
reading
in
the
*NL*
garden
was
all
about
titles
,
and
that
she
knew
the
exact
date
at
which
*NL*
her
grandpapa
would
have
come
into
the
book
,
if
he
ever
had
come
at
all
.
*NL*
Drummle
did
n't
say
much
,
but
in
his
limited
way
-LRB-
he
struck
me
as
a
sulky
*NL*
kind
of
fellow
-RRB-
he
spoke
as
one
of
the
elect
,
and
recognized
Mrs.
Pocket
*NL*
as
a
woman
and
a
sister
.
No
one
but
themselves
and
Mrs.
Coiler
the
toady
*NL*
neighbor
showed
any
interest
in
this
part
of
the
conversation
,
and
it
*NL*
appeared
to
me
that
it
was
painful
to
Herbert
;
but
it
promised
to
last
*NL*
a
long
time
,
when
the
page
came
in
with
the
announcement
of
a
domestic
*NL*
affliction
.
It
was
,
in
effect
,
that
the
cook
had
mislaid
the
beef
.
To
my
*NL*
unutterable
amazement
,
I
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
saw
Mr.
Pocket
*NL*
relieve
his
mind
by
going
through
a
performance
that
struck
me
as
very
*NL*
extraordinary
,
but
which
made
no
impression
on
anybody
else
,
and
*NL*
with
which
I
soon
became
as
familiar
as
the
rest
.
He
laid
down
the
*NL*
carving-knife
and
fork
,
--
being
engaged
in
carving
,
at
the
moment
,
--
put
*NL*
his
two
hands
into
his
disturbed
hair
,
and
appeared
to
make
an
*NL*
extraordinary
effort
to
lift
himself
up
by
it
.
When
he
had
done
this
,
*NL*
and
had
not
lifted
himself
up
at
all
,
he
quietly
went
on
with
what
he
*NL*
was
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Coiler
then
changed
the
subject
and
began
to
flatter
me
.
I
liked
*NL*
it
for
a
few
moments
,
but
she
flattered
me
so
very
grossly
that
the
*NL*
pleasure
was
soon
over
.
She
had
a
serpentine
way
of
coming
close
at
*NL*
me
when
she
pretended
to
be
vitally
interested
in
the
friends
and
*NL*
localities
I
had
left
,
which
was
altogether
snaky
and
fork-tongued
;
and
*NL*
when
she
made
an
occasional
bounce
upon
Startop
-LRB-
who
said
very
little
to
*NL*
her
-RRB-
,
or
upon
Drummle
-LRB-
who
said
less
-RRB-
,
I
rather
envied
them
for
being
on
*NL*
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
the
children
were
introduced
,
and
Mrs.
Coiler
made
admiring
*NL*
comments
on
their
eyes
,
noses
,
and
legs
,
--
a
sagacious
way
of
improving
*NL*
their
minds
.
There
were
four
little
girls
,
and
two
little
boys
,
besides
*NL*
the
baby
who
might
have
been
either
,
and
the
baby
's
next
successor
who
*NL*
was
as
yet
neither
.
They
were
brought
in
by
Flopson
and
Millers
,
much
as
*NL*
though
those
two
non-commissioned
officers
had
been
recruiting
somewhere
*NL*
for
children
and
had
enlisted
these
,
while
Mrs.
Pocket
looked
at
the
*NL*
young
Nobles
that
ought
to
have
been
as
if
she
rather
thought
she
had
*NL*
had
the
pleasure
of
inspecting
them
before
,
but
did
n't
quite
know
what
*NL*
to
make
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
Give
me
your
fork
,
Mum
,
and
take
the
baby
,
''
said
Flopson
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
take
it
that
way
,
or
you
'll
get
its
head
under
the
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
advised
,
Mrs.
Pocket
took
it
the
other
way
,
and
got
its
head
*NL*
upon
the
table
;
which
was
announced
to
all
present
by
a
prodigious
*NL*
concussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
!
Give
it
me
back
,
Mum
,
''
said
Flopson
;
``
and
Miss
Jane
,
come
*NL*
and
dance
to
baby
,
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
little
girls
,
a
mere
mite
who
seemed
to
have
prematurely
*NL*
taken
upon
herself
some
charge
of
the
others
,
stepped
out
of
her
place
*NL*
by
me
,
and
danced
to
and
from
the
baby
until
it
left
off
crying
,
and
*NL*
laughed
.
Then
,
all
the
children
laughed
,
and
Mr.
Pocket
-LRB-
who
in
the
*NL*
meantime
had
twice
endeavored
to
lift
himself
up
by
the
hair
-RRB-
laughed
,
*NL*
and
we
all
laughed
and
were
glad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Flopson
,
by
dint
of
doubling
the
baby
at
the
joints
like
a
Dutch
doll
,
*NL*
then
got
it
safely
into
Mrs.
Pocket
's
lap
,
and
gave
it
the
nut-crackers
*NL*
to
play
with
;
at
the
same
time
recommending
Mrs.
Pocket
to
take
notice
*NL*
that
the
handles
of
that
instrument
were
not
likely
to
agree
with
its
*NL*
eyes
,
and
sharply
charging
Miss
Jane
to
look
after
the
same
.
Then
,
the
*NL*
two
nurses
left
the
room
,
and
had
a
lively
scuffle
on
the
staircase
with
*NL*
a
dissipated
page
who
had
waited
at
dinner
,
and
who
had
clearly
lost
*NL*
half
his
buttons
at
the
gaming-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
made
very
uneasy
in
my
mind
by
Mrs.
Pocket
's
falling
into
a
*NL*
discussion
with
Drummle
respecting
two
baronetcies
,
while
she
ate
a
*NL*
sliced
orange
steeped
in
sugar
and
wine
,
and
,
forgetting
all
about
the
*NL*
baby
on
her
lap
,
who
did
most
appalling
things
with
the
nut-crackers
.
At
*NL*
length
little
Jane
,
perceiving
its
young
brains
to
be
imperilled
,
softly
*NL*
left
her
place
,
and
with
many
small
artifices
coaxed
the
dangerous
*NL*
weapon
away
.
Mrs.
Pocket
finishing
her
orange
at
about
the
same
time
,
*NL*
and
not
approving
of
this
,
said
to
Jane
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
naughty
child
,
how
dare
you
?
Go
and
sit
down
this
instant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
dear
,
''
lisped
the
little
girl
,
``
baby
ood
have
put
hith
eyeth
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
tell
me
so
?
''
retorted
Mrs.
Pocket
.
``
Go
and
sit
down
in
*NL*
your
chair
this
moment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocket
's
dignity
was
so
crushing
,
that
I
felt
quite
abashed
,
as
if
*NL*
I
myself
had
done
something
to
rouse
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Belinda
,
''
remonstrated
Mr.
Pocket
,
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
*NL*
``
how
can
you
be
so
unreasonable
?
Jane
only
interfered
for
the
protection
*NL*
of
baby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
allow
anybody
to
interfere
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pocket
.
``
I
am
*NL*
surprised
,
Matthew
,
that
you
should
expose
me
to
the
affront
of
*NL*
interference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
cried
Mr.
Pocket
,
in
an
outbreak
of
desolate
desperation
.
*NL*
``
Are
infants
to
be
nut-crackered
into
their
tombs
,
and
is
nobody
to
save
*NL*
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
be
interfered
with
by
Jane
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pocket
,
with
a
*NL*
majestic
glance
at
that
innocent
little
offender
.
``
I
hope
I
know
my
poor
*NL*
grandpapa
's
position
.
Jane
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pocket
got
his
hands
in
his
hair
again
,
and
this
time
really
did
*NL*
lift
himself
some
inches
out
of
his
chair
.
``
Hear
this
!
''
he
helplessly
*NL*
exclaimed
to
the
elements
.
``
Babies
are
to
be
nut-crackered
dead
,
for
*NL*
people
's
poor
grandpapa
's
positions
!
''
Then
he
let
himself
down
again
,
*NL*
and
became
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
looked
awkwardly
at
the
tablecloth
while
this
was
going
on
.
A
*NL*
pause
succeeded
,
during
which
the
honest
and
irrepressible
baby
made
a
*NL*
series
of
leaps
and
crows
at
little
Jane
,
who
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
*NL*
only
member
of
the
family
-LRB-
irrespective
of
servants
-RRB-
with
whom
it
had
*NL*
any
decided
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Drummle
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pocket
,
``
will
you
ring
for
Flopson
?
Jane
,
you
*NL*
undutiful
little
thing
,
go
and
lie
down
.
Now
,
baby
darling
,
come
with
*NL*
ma
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
baby
was
the
soul
of
honor
,
and
protested
with
all
its
might
.
It
*NL*
doubled
itself
up
the
wrong
way
over
Mrs.
Pocket
's
arm
,
exhibited
a
pair
*NL*
of
knitted
shoes
and
dimpled
ankles
to
the
company
in
lieu
of
its
soft
*NL*
face
,
and
was
carried
out
in
the
highest
state
of
mutiny
.
And
it
gained
*NL*
its
point
after
all
,
for
I
saw
it
through
the
window
within
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
being
nursed
by
little
Jane
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
that
the
other
five
children
were
left
behind
at
the
*NL*
dinner-table
,
through
Flopson
's
having
some
private
engagement
,
and
*NL*
their
not
being
anybody
else
's
business
.
I
thus
became
aware
of
the
*NL*
mutual
relations
between
them
and
Mr.
Pocket
,
which
were
exemplified
in
*NL*
the
following
manner
.
Mr.
Pocket
,
with
the
normal
perplexity
of
his
face
*NL*
heightened
and
his
hair
rumpled
,
looked
at
them
for
some
minutes
,
as
if
*NL*
he
could
n't
make
out
how
they
came
to
be
boarding
and
lodging
in
that
*NL*
establishment
,
and
why
they
had
n't
been
billeted
by
Nature
on
*NL*
somebody
else
.
Then
,
in
a
distant
Missionary
way
he
asked
them
certain
*NL*
questions
,
--
as
why
little
Joe
had
that
hole
in
his
frill
,
who
said
,
Pa
,
*NL*
Flopson
was
going
to
mend
it
when
she
had
time
,
--
and
how
little
Fanny
*NL*
came
by
that
whitlow
,
who
said
,
Pa
,
Millers
was
going
to
poultice
it
*NL*
when
she
did
n't
forget
.
Then
,
he
melted
into
parental
tenderness
,
and
*NL*
gave
them
a
shilling
apiece
and
told
them
to
go
and
play
;
and
then
as
*NL*
they
went
out
,
with
one
very
strong
effort
to
lift
himself
up
by
the
*NL*
hair
he
dismissed
the
hopeless
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
there
was
rowing
on
the
river
.
As
Drummle
and
Startop
had
*NL*
each
a
boat
,
I
resolved
to
set
up
mine
,
and
to
cut
them
both
out
.
I
was
*NL*
pretty
good
at
most
exercises
in
which
country
boys
are
adepts
,
but
as
*NL*
I
was
conscious
of
wanting
elegance
of
style
for
the
Thames
,
--
not
to
say
*NL*
for
other
waters
,
--
I
at
once
engaged
to
place
myself
under
the
tuition
*NL*
of
the
winner
of
a
prize-wherry
who
plied
at
our
stairs
,
and
to
whom
I
*NL*
was
introduced
by
my
new
allies
.
This
practical
authority
confused
me
*NL*
very
much
by
saying
I
had
the
arm
of
a
blacksmith
.
If
he
could
have
*NL*
known
how
nearly
the
compliment
lost
him
his
pupil
,
I
doubt
if
he
would
*NL*
have
paid
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
supper-tray
after
we
got
home
at
night
,
and
I
think
we
*NL*
should
all
have
enjoyed
ourselves
,
but
for
a
rather
disagreeable
*NL*
domestic
occurrence
.
Mr.
Pocket
was
in
good
spirits
,
when
a
housemaid
*NL*
came
in
,
and
said
,
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
I
should
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
your
master
?
''
said
Mrs.
Pocket
,
whose
dignity
was
roused
*NL*
again
.
``
How
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
?
Go
and
speak
to
Flopson
.
Or
*NL*
speak
to
me
--
at
some
other
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begging
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
''
returned
the
housemaid
,
``
I
should
wish
to
*NL*
speak
at
once
,
and
to
speak
to
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
,
Mr.
Pocket
went
out
of
the
room
,
and
we
made
the
best
of
*NL*
ourselves
until
he
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
pretty
thing
,
Belinda
!
''
said
Mr.
Pocket
,
returning
with
a
*NL*
countenance
expressive
of
grief
and
despair
.
``
Here
's
the
cook
lying
*NL*
insensibly
drunk
on
the
kitchen
floor
,
with
a
large
bundle
of
fresh
*NL*
butter
made
up
in
the
cupboard
ready
to
sell
for
grease
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocket
instantly
showed
much
amiable
emotion
,
and
said
,
``
This
is
*NL*
that
odious
Sophia
's
doing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
Belinda
?
''
demanded
Mr.
Pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sophia
has
told
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pocket
.
``
Did
I
not
see
her
with
my
own
*NL*
eyes
and
hear
her
with
my
own
ears
,
come
into
the
room
just
now
and
ask
*NL*
to
speak
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
has
she
not
taken
me
downstairs
,
Belinda
,
''
returned
Mr.
Pocket
,
*NL*
``
and
shown
me
the
woman
,
and
the
bundle
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
defend
her
,
Matthew
,
''
said
Mrs.
Pocket
,
``
for
making
*NL*
mischief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pocket
uttered
a
dismal
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
,
grandpapa
's
granddaughter
,
to
be
nothing
in
the
house
?
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocket
.
``
Besides
,
the
cook
has
always
been
a
very
nice
respectful
woman
,
*NL*
and
said
in
the
most
natural
manner
when
she
came
to
look
after
the
*NL*
situation
,
that
she
felt
I
was
born
to
be
a
Duchess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sofa
where
Mr.
Pocket
stood
,
and
he
dropped
upon
it
in
the
*NL*
attitude
of
the
Dying
Gladiator
.
Still
in
that
attitude
he
said
,
with
a
*NL*
hollow
voice
,
``
Good
night
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
when
I
deemed
it
advisable
to
go
to
*NL*
bed
and
leave
him
.

Chapter
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
After
two
or
three
days
,
when
I
had
established
myself
in
my
room
and
*NL*
had
gone
backwards
and
forwards
to
London
several
times
,
and
had
ordered
*NL*
all
I
wanted
of
my
tradesmen
,
Mr.
Pocket
and
I
had
a
long
talk
together
.
*NL*
He
knew
more
of
my
intended
career
than
I
knew
myself
,
for
he
referred
*NL*
to
his
having
been
told
by
Mr.
Jaggers
that
I
was
not
designed
for
any
*NL*
profession
,
and
that
I
should
be
well
enough
educated
for
my
destiny
*NL*
if
I
could
``
hold
my
own
''
with
the
average
of
young
men
in
prosperous
*NL*
circumstances
.
I
acquiesced
,
of
course
,
knowing
nothing
to
the
contrary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
advised
my
attending
certain
places
in
London
,
for
the
acquisition
of
*NL*
such
mere
rudiments
as
I
wanted
,
and
my
investing
him
with
the
functions
*NL*
of
explainer
and
director
of
all
my
studies
.
He
hoped
that
with
*NL*
intelligent
assistance
I
should
meet
with
little
to
discourage
me
,
and
*NL*
should
soon
be
able
to
dispense
with
any
aid
but
his
.
Through
his
way
*NL*
of
saying
this
,
and
much
more
to
similar
purpose
,
he
placed
himself
on
*NL*
confidential
terms
with
me
in
an
admirable
manner
;
and
I
may
state
*NL*
at
once
that
he
was
always
so
zealous
and
honorable
in
fulfilling
his
*NL*
compact
with
me
,
that
he
made
me
zealous
and
honorable
in
fulfilling
*NL*
mine
with
him
.
If
he
had
shown
indifference
as
a
master
,
I
have
no
doubt
*NL*
I
should
have
returned
the
compliment
as
a
pupil
;
he
gave
me
no
such
*NL*
excuse
,
and
each
of
us
did
the
other
justice
.
Nor
did
I
ever
regard
*NL*
him
as
having
anything
ludicrous
about
him
--
or
anything
but
what
was
*NL*
serious
,
honest
,
and
good
--
in
his
tutor
communication
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
points
were
settled
,
and
so
far
carried
out
as
that
I
had
*NL*
begun
to
work
in
earnest
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
I
could
retain
my
*NL*
bedroom
in
Barnard
's
Inn
,
my
life
would
be
agreeably
varied
,
while
my
*NL*
manners
would
be
none
the
worse
for
Herbert
's
society
.
Mr.
Pocket
did
*NL*
not
object
to
this
arrangement
,
but
urged
that
before
any
step
could
*NL*
possibly
be
taken
in
it
,
it
must
be
submitted
to
my
guardian
.
I
felt
*NL*
that
this
delicacy
arose
out
of
the
consideration
that
the
plan
would
*NL*
save
Herbert
some
expense
,
so
I
went
off
to
Little
Britain
and
imparted
*NL*
my
wish
to
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
buy
the
furniture
now
hired
for
me
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
one
or
two
*NL*
other
little
things
,
I
should
be
quite
at
home
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
it
!
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
with
a
short
laugh
.
``
I
told
you
you
'd
get
on
.
*NL*
Well
!
How
much
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
did
n't
know
how
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
retorted
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
How
much
?
Fifty
pounds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
not
nearly
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
pounds
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
such
a
great
fall
,
that
I
said
in
discomfiture
,
``
O
,
more
than
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
that
,
eh
!
''
retorted
Mr.
Jaggers
,
lying
in
wait
for
me
,
with
*NL*
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
his
eyes
on
the
wall
*NL*
behind
me
;
``
how
much
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
difficult
to
fix
a
sum
,
''
said
I
,
hesitating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
Let
's
get
at
it
.
Twice
five
;
will
that
do
?
*NL*
Three
times
five
;
will
that
do
?
Four
times
five
;
will
that
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
thought
that
would
do
handsomely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
times
five
will
do
handsomely
,
will
it
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
*NL*
knitting
his
brows
.
``
Now
,
what
do
you
make
of
four
times
five
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
make
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
;
``
how
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
make
it
twenty
pounds
,
''
said
I
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
what
I
make
it
,
my
friend
,
''
observed
Mr.
Jaggers
,
with
a
*NL*
knowing
and
contradictory
toss
of
his
head
.
``
I
want
to
know
what
you
*NL*
make
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
pounds
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wemmick
!
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
opening
his
office
door
.
``
Take
Mr.
Pip
's
*NL*
written
order
,
and
pay
him
twenty
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
strongly
marked
way
of
doing
business
made
a
strongly
marked
*NL*
impression
on
me
,
and
that
not
of
an
agreeable
kind
.
Mr.
Jaggers
never
*NL*
laughed
;
but
he
wore
great
bright
creaking
boots
,
and
,
in
poising
*NL*
himself
on
these
boots
,
with
his
large
head
bent
down
and
his
eyebrows
*NL*
joined
together
,
awaiting
an
answer
,
he
sometimes
caused
the
boots
to
*NL*
creak
,
as
if
they
laughed
in
a
dry
and
suspicious
way
.
As
he
happened
*NL*
to
go
out
now
,
and
as
Wemmick
was
brisk
and
talkative
,
I
said
to
Wemmick
*NL*
that
I
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
Mr.
Jaggers
's
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
that
,
and
he
'll
take
it
as
a
compliment
,
''
answered
Wemmick
;
*NL*
``
he
do
n't
mean
that
you
should
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
--
Oh
!
''
for
*NL*
I
looked
surprised
,
``
it
's
not
personal
;
it
's
professional
:
only
*NL*
professional
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
was
at
his
desk
,
lunching
--
and
crunching
--
on
a
dry
hard
biscuit
;
*NL*
pieces
of
which
he
threw
from
time
to
time
into
his
slit
of
a
mouth
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
posting
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
seems
to
me
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
as
if
he
had
set
a
man-trap
and
was
*NL*
watching
it
.
Suddenly-click
--
you
're
caught
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
remarking
that
man-traps
were
not
among
the
amenities
of
life
,
I
*NL*
said
I
supposed
he
was
very
skilful
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deep
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
as
Australia
.
''
Pointing
with
his
pen
at
the
*NL*
office
floor
,
to
express
that
Australia
was
understood
,
for
the
purposes
*NL*
of
the
figure
,
to
be
symmetrically
on
the
opposite
spot
of
the
globe
.
*NL*
``
If
there
was
anything
deeper
,
''
added
Wemmick
,
bringing
his
pen
to
*NL*
paper
,
``
he
'd
be
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
I
said
I
supposed
he
had
a
fine
business
,
and
Wemmick
said
,
*NL*
``
Ca-pi-tal
!
''
Then
I
asked
if
there
were
many
clerks
?
to
which
he
*NL*
replied
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
run
much
into
clerks
,
because
there
's
only
one
Jaggers
,
and
*NL*
people
wo
n't
have
him
at
second
hand
.
There
are
only
four
of
us
.
Would
*NL*
you
like
to
see
'em
?
You
are
one
of
us
,
as
I
may
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
accepted
the
offer
.
When
Mr.
Wemmick
had
put
all
the
biscuit
into
the
*NL*
post
,
and
had
paid
me
my
money
from
a
cash-box
in
a
safe
,
the
key
*NL*
of
which
safe
he
kept
somewhere
down
his
back
and
produced
from
his
*NL*
coat-collar
like
an
iron-pigtail
,
we
went
upstairs
.
The
house
was
dark
*NL*
and
shabby
,
and
the
greasy
shoulders
that
had
left
their
mark
in
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
's
room
seemed
to
have
been
shuffling
up
and
down
the
staircase
*NL*
for
years
.
In
the
front
first
floor
,
a
clerk
who
looked
something
*NL*
between
a
publican
and
a
rat-catcher
--
a
large
pale
,
puffed
,
swollen
*NL*
man
--
was
attentively
engaged
with
three
or
four
people
of
shabby
*NL*
appearance
,
whom
he
treated
as
unceremoniously
as
everybody
seemed
to
*NL*
be
treated
who
contributed
to
Mr.
Jaggers
's
coffers
.
``
Getting
evidence
*NL*
together
,
''
said
Mr.
Wemmick
,
as
we
came
out
,
``
for
the
Bailey
.
''
In
the
*NL*
room
over
that
,
a
little
flabby
terrier
of
a
clerk
with
dangling
hair
*NL*
-LRB-
his
cropping
seemed
to
have
been
forgotten
when
he
was
a
puppy
-RRB-
was
*NL*
similarly
engaged
with
a
man
with
weak
eyes
,
whom
Mr.
Wemmick
presented
*NL*
to
me
as
a
smelter
who
kept
his
pot
always
boiling
,
and
who
would
melt
*NL*
me
anything
I
pleased
,
--
and
who
was
in
an
excessive
white-perspiration
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
been
trying
his
art
on
himself
.
In
a
back
room
,
a
*NL*
high-shouldered
man
with
a
face-ache
tied
up
in
dirty
flannel
,
who
was
*NL*
dressed
in
old
black
clothes
that
bore
the
appearance
of
having
been
*NL*
waxed
,
was
stooping
over
his
work
of
making
fair
copies
of
the
notes
of
*NL*
the
other
two
gentlemen
,
for
Mr.
Jaggers
's
own
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
the
establishment
.
When
we
went
downstairs
again
,
Wemmick
*NL*
led
me
into
my
guardian
's
room
,
and
said
,
``
This
you
've
seen
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
''
said
I
,
as
the
two
odious
casts
with
the
twitchy
leer
upon
them
*NL*
caught
my
sight
again
,
``
whose
likenesses
are
those
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
?
''
said
Wemmick
,
getting
upon
a
chair
,
and
blowing
the
dust
off
*NL*
the
horrible
heads
before
bringing
them
down
.
``
These
are
two
celebrated
*NL*
ones
.
Famous
clients
of
ours
that
got
us
a
world
of
credit
.
This
chap
*NL*
-LRB-
why
you
must
have
come
down
in
the
night
and
been
peeping
into
the
*NL*
inkstand
,
to
get
this
blot
upon
your
eyebrow
,
you
old
rascal
!
-RRB-
murdered
*NL*
his
master
,
and
,
considering
that
he
was
n't
brought
up
to
evidence
,
*NL*
did
n't
plan
it
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
like
him
?
''
I
asked
,
recoiling
from
the
brute
,
as
Wemmick
spat
*NL*
upon
his
eyebrow
and
gave
it
a
rub
with
his
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
him
?
It
's
himself
,
you
know
.
The
cast
was
made
in
Newgate
,
*NL*
directly
after
he
was
taken
down
.
You
had
a
particular
fancy
for
*NL*
me
,
had
n't
you
,
Old
Artful
?
''
said
Wemmick
.
He
then
explained
this
*NL*
affectionate
apostrophe
,
by
touching
his
brooch
representing
the
lady
*NL*
and
the
weeping
willow
at
the
tomb
with
the
urn
upon
it
,
and
saying
,
*NL*
``
Had
it
made
for
me
,
express
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
lady
anybody
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
returned
Wemmick
.
``
Only
his
game
.
-LRB-
You
liked
your
bit
of
game
,
*NL*
did
n't
you
?
-RRB-
No
;
deuce
a
bit
of
a
lady
in
the
case
,
Mr.
Pip
,
except
*NL*
one
,
--
and
she
was
n't
of
this
slender
lady-like
sort
,
and
you
would
n't
*NL*
have
caught
her
looking
after
this
urn
,
unless
there
was
something
to
*NL*
drink
in
it
.
''
Wemmick
's
attention
being
thus
directed
to
his
brooch
,
he
*NL*
put
down
the
cast
,
and
polished
the
brooch
with
his
pocket-handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
that
other
creature
come
to
the
same
end
?
''
I
asked
.
``
He
has
the
*NL*
same
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
,
''
said
Wemmick
;
``
it
's
the
genuine
look
.
Much
as
if
one
*NL*
nostril
was
caught
up
with
a
horse-hair
and
a
little
fish-hook
.
Yes
,
*NL*
he
came
to
the
same
end
;
quite
the
natural
end
here
,
I
assure
you
.
*NL*
He
forged
wills
,
this
blade
did
,
if
he
did
n't
also
put
the
supposed
*NL*
testators
to
sleep
too
.
You
were
a
gentlemanly
Cove
,
though
''
-LRB-
Mr.
*NL*
Wemmick
was
again
apostrophizing
-RRB-
,
``
and
you
said
you
could
write
Greek
.
*NL*
Yah
,
Bounceable
!
What
a
liar
you
were
!
I
never
met
such
a
liar
as
you
!
''
*NL*
Before
putting
his
late
friend
on
his
shelf
again
,
Wemmick
touched
the
*NL*
largest
of
his
mourning
rings
and
said
,
``
Sent
out
to
buy
it
for
me
,
only
*NL*
the
day
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
putting
up
the
other
cast
and
coming
down
from
the
chair
,
*NL*
the
thought
crossed
my
mind
that
all
his
personal
jewelry
was
derived
*NL*
from
like
sources
.
As
he
had
shown
no
diffidence
on
the
subject
,
I
*NL*
ventured
on
the
liberty
of
asking
him
the
question
,
when
he
stood
before
*NL*
me
,
dusting
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
''
he
returned
,
``
these
are
all
gifts
of
that
kind
.
One
brings
*NL*
another
,
you
see
;
that
's
the
way
of
it
.
I
always
take
'em
.
They
're
*NL*
curiosities
.
And
they
're
property
.
They
may
not
be
worth
much
,
but
,
*NL*
after
all
,
they
're
property
and
portable

It
do
n't
signify
to
you
with
*NL*
your
brilliant
lookout

but
as
to
myself

my
guiding-star
always
is
,
*NL*
`
Get
hold

property

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
rendered
homage
to
this
light
,
he
went
on
to
say
,
in
a
*NL*
friendly
manner
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
at
any
odd
time

you
have
nothing
better

you
would

coming
over
to
see
me
at
Walworth
,
I
could
offer
you
a
bed
,
and
I
*NL*
should
consider
it
an
honor
.
I
have
not
much
to
show
you
;
but
such
two
*NL*
or
three
curiosities
as
I
have
got
you
might
like
to
look
over

I
am
*NL*
fond
of
a
bit
of
garden
and
a
summer-house

*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
should
be
delighted
to
accept
his
hospitality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee

said
he
;
``
then

'll
consider

uncommon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
you
'll
see
a
wild
beast
tamed
.
Not
so
very
*NL*
uncommon
,
you
'll
tell
me
.
I
reply
,
that
depends
on
the
original
wildness
*NL*
of
the
beast
,
and
the
amount
of
taming
.
It
wo
n't
lower
your
opinion
of
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
's
powers
.
Keep
your
eye
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
would
do
so
,
with
all
the
interest
and
curiosity
that
his
*NL*
preparation
awakened
.
As
I
was
taking
my
departure
,
he
asked
me
if
I
*NL*
would
like
to
devote
five
minutes
to
seeing
Mr.
Jaggers
``
at
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
reasons
,
and
not
least
because
I
did
n't
clearly
know
what
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
would
be
found
to
be
``
at
,
''
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
We
dived
into
the
City
,
and
came
up
in
a
crowded
police-court
,
where
*NL*
a
blood-relation
-LRB-
in
the
murderous
sense
-RRB-
of
the
deceased
,
with
the
*NL*
fanciful
taste
in
brooches
,
was
standing
at
the
bar
,
uncomfortably
*NL*
chewing
something
;
while
my
guardian
had
a
woman
under
examination
or
*NL*
cross-examination
,
--
I
do
n't
know
which
,
--
and
was
striking
her
,
and
*NL*
the
bench
,
and
everybody
present
,
with
awe
.
If
anybody
,
of
whatsoever
*NL*
degree
,
said
a
word
that
he
did
n't
approve
of
,
he
instantly
required
to
*NL*
have
it
``
taken
down
.
''
If
anybody
would
n't
make
an
admission
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
it
out
of
you
!
''
and
if
anybody
made
an
admission
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Now
I
have
got
you
!
''
The
magistrates
shivered
under
a
single
bite
of
*NL*
his
finger
.
Thieves
and
thief-takers
hung
in
dread
rapture
on
his
words
,
*NL*
and
shrank
when
a
hair
of
his
eyebrows
turned
in
their
direction
.
Which
*NL*
side
he
was
on
I
could
n't
make
out
,
for
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
grinding
*NL*
the
whole
place
in
a
mill
;
I
only
know
that
when
I
stole
out
on
tiptoe
,
*NL*
he
was
not
on
the
side
of
the
bench
;
for
,
he
was
making
the
legs
of
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
who
presided
,
quite
convulsive
under
the
table
,
by
his
*NL*
denunciations
of
his
conduct
as
the
representative
of
British
law
and
*NL*
justice
in
that
chair
that
day

Chapter
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
Bentley
Drummle
,
who
was
so
sulky
a
fellow
that
he
even
took
up
a
book
*NL*
as
if
its
writer
had
done
him
an
injury
,
did
not
take
up
an
*NL*
acquaintance
in
a
more
agreeable
spirit
.
Heavy
in
figure
,
movement
,
*NL*
and
comprehension
,
--
in
the
sluggish
complexion
of
his
face
,
and
in
*NL*
the
large
,
awkward
tongue
that
seemed
to
loll
about
in
his
mouth
as
*NL*
he
himself
lolled
about
in
a
room
,
--
he
was
idle
,
proud
,
niggardly
,
*NL*
reserved
,
and
suspicious
.
He
came
of
rich
people
down
in
Somersetshire
,
*NL*
who
had
nursed
this
combination
of
qualities
until
they
made
the
*NL*
discovery
that
it
was
just
of
age
and
a
blockhead
.
Thus
,
Bentley
Drummle
*NL*
had
come
to
Mr.
Pocket
when
he
was
a
head
taller
than
that
gentleman
,
*NL*
and
half
a
dozen
heads
thicker
than
most
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Startop
had
been
spoilt
by
a
weak
mother
and
kept
at
home
when
he
*NL*
ought
to
have
been
at
school
,
but
he
was
devotedly
attached
to
her
,
and
*NL*
admired
her
beyond
measure
.
He
had
a
woman
's
delicacy
of
feature
,
*NL*
and
was
--
``
as
you
may
see
,
though
you
never
saw
her
,
''
said
Herbert
to
*NL*
me
--
``
exactly
like
his
mother
.
''
It
was
but
natural
that
I
should
take
to
*NL*
him
much
more
kindly
than
to
Drummle
,
and
that
,
even
in
the
earliest
*NL*
evenings
of
our
boating
,
he
and
I
should
pull
homeward
abreast
of
one
*NL*
another
,
conversing
from
boat
to
boat
,
while
Bentley
Drummle
came
up
*NL*
in
our
wake
alone
,
under
the
overhanging
banks
and
among
the
rushes
.
He
*NL*
would
always
creep
in-shore
like
some
uncomfortable
amphibious
creature
,
*NL*
even
when
the
tide
would
have
sent
him
fast
upon
his
way
;
and
I
always
*NL*
think
of
him
as
coming
after
us
in
the
dark
or
by
the
back-water
,
*NL*
when
our
own
two
boats
were
breaking
the
sunset
or
the
moonlight
in
*NL*
mid-stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
was
my
intimate
companion
and
friend
.
I
presented
him
with
a
*NL*
half-share
in
my
boat
,
which
was
the
occasion
of
his
often
coming
down
*NL*
to
Hammersmith
;
and
my
possession
of
a
half-share
in
his
chambers
often
*NL*
took
me
up
to
London
.
We
used
to
walk
between
the
two
places
at
all
*NL*
hours
.
I
have
an
affection
for
the
road
yet
-LRB-
though
it
is
not
so
*NL*
pleasant
a
road
as
it
was
then
-RRB-
,
formed
in
the
impressibility
of
untried
*NL*
youth
and
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
been
in
Mr.
Pocket
's
family
a
month
or
two
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Camilla
turned
up
.
Camilla
was
Mr.
Pocket
's
sister
.
Georgiana
,
whom
I
*NL*
had
seen
at
Miss
Havisham
's
on
the
same
occasion
,
also
turned
up
.
She
*NL*
was
a
cousin
,
--
an
indigestive
single
woman
,
who
called
her
rigidity
*NL*
religion
,
and
her
liver
love
.
These
people
hated
me
with
the
hatred
of
*NL*
cupidity
and
disappointment
.
As
a
matter
of
course
,
they
fawned
upon
*NL*
me
in
my
prosperity
with
the
basest
meanness
.
Towards
Mr.
Pocket
,
as
*NL*
a
grown-up
infant
with
no
notion
of
his
own
interests
,
they
showed
the
*NL*
complacent
forbearance
I
had
heard
them
express
.
Mrs.
Pocket
they
*NL*
held
in
contempt
;
but
they
allowed
the
poor
soul
to
have
been
heavily
*NL*
disappointed
in
life
,
because
that
shed
a
feeble
reflected
light
upon
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
surroundings
among
which
I
settled
down
,
and
applied
*NL*
myself
to
my
education
.
I
soon
contracted
expensive
habits
,
and
began
*NL*
to
spend
an
amount
of
money
that
within
a
few
short
months
I
should
have
*NL*
thought
almost
fabulous
;
but
through
good
and
evil
I
stuck
to
my
books
.
*NL*
There
was
no
other
merit
in
this
,
than
my
having
sense
enough
to
feel
*NL*
my
deficiencies
.
Between
Mr.
Pocket
and
Herbert
I
got
on
fast
;
and
,
with
*NL*
one
or
the
other
always
at
my
elbow
to
give
me
the
start
I
wanted
,
and
*NL*
clear
obstructions
out
of
my
road
,
I
must
have
been
as
great
a
dolt
as
*NL*
Drummle
if
I
had
done
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
seen
Mr.
Wemmick
for
some
weeks
,
when
I
thought
I
would
write
*NL*
him
a
note
and
propose
to
go
home
with
him
on
a
certain
evening
.
He
*NL*
replied
that
it
would
give
him
much
pleasure
,
and
that
he
would
expect
*NL*
me
at
the
office
at
six
o'clock
.
Thither
I
went
,
and
there
I
found
him
,
*NL*
putting
the
key
of
his
safe
down
his
back
as
the
clock
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
think
of
walking
down
to
Walworth
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
you
approve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
,
''
was
Wemmick
's
reply
,
``
for
I
have
had
my
legs
under
the
desk
*NL*
all
day
,
and
shall
be
glad
to
stretch
them
.
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
*NL*
have
got
for
supper
,
Mr.
Pip
.
I
have
got
a
stewed
steak
,
--
which
is
*NL*
of
home
preparation
,
--
and
a
cold
roast
fowl
,
--
which
is
from
the
*NL*
cook
's
-
shop
.
I
think
it
's
tender
,
because
the
master
of
the
shop
was
a
*NL*
Juryman
in
some
cases
of
ours
the
other
day
,
and
we
let
him
down
easy
.
*NL*
I
reminded
him
of
it
when
I
bought
the
fowl
,
and
I
said
,
``
Pick
us
out
*NL*
a
good
one
,
old
Briton
,
because
if
we
had
chosen
to
keep
you
in
the
box
*NL*
another
day
or
two
,
we
could
easily
have
done
it
.
''
He
said
to
that
,
*NL*
``
Let
me
make
you
a
present
of
the
best
fowl
in
the
shop
.
''
I
let
him
,
of
*NL*
course
.
As
far
as
it
goes
,
it
's
property
and
portable
.
You
do
n't
object
*NL*
to
an
aged
parent
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
thought
he
was
still
speaking
of
the
fowl
,
until
he
added
,
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
got
an
aged
parent
at
my
place
.
''
I
then
said
what
*NL*
politeness
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
you
have
n't
dined
with
Mr.
Jaggers
yet
?
''
he
pursued
,
as
we
walked
*NL*
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
told
me
so
this
afternoon
when
he
heard
you
were
coming
.
I
expect
*NL*
you
'll
have
an
invitation
to-morrow
.
He
's
going
to
ask
your
pals
,
too
.
*NL*
Three
of
'em
;
ai
n't
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
was
not
in
the
habit
of
counting
Drummle
as
one
of
my
*NL*
intimate
associates
,
I
answered
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
's
going
to
ask
the
whole
gang
,
''
--
I
hardly
felt
complimented
by
*NL*
the
word
,
--
``
and
whatever
he
gives
you
,
he
'll
give
you
good
.
Do
n't
look
*NL*
forward
to
variety
,
but
you
'll
have
excellence
.
And
there
's
another
rum
*NL*
thing
in
his
house
,
''
proceeded
Wemmick
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
as
if
*NL*
the
remark
followed
on
the
housekeeper
understood
;
``
he
never
lets
a
door
*NL*
or
window
be
fastened
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
never
robbed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
!
''
returned
Wemmick
.
``
He
says
,
and
gives
it
out
publicly
,
``
I
*NL*
want
to
see
the
man
who
'll
rob
me
.
''
Lord
bless
you
,
I
have
heard
him
,
a
*NL*
hundred
times
,
if
I
have
heard
him
once
,
say
to
regular
cracksmen
in
our
*NL*
front
office
,
``
You
know
where
I
live
;
now
,
no
bolt
is
ever
drawn
there
;
*NL*
why
do
n't
you
do
a
stroke
of
business
with
me
?
Come
;
ca
n't
I
tempt
you
?
''
*NL*
Not
a
man
of
them
,
sir
,
would
be
bold
enough
to
try
it
on
,
for
love
or
*NL*
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
dread
him
so
much
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dread
him
,
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
I
believe
you
they
dread
him
.
Not
but
what
*NL*
he
's
artful
,
even
in
his
defiance
of
them
.
No
silver
,
sir
.
Britannia
*NL*
metal
,
every
spoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
they
would
n't
have
much
,
''
I
observed
,
``
even
if
they
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
But
he
would
have
much
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
cutting
me
short
,
``
and
they
*NL*
know
it
.
He
'd
have
their
lives
,
and
the
lives
of
scores
of
'em
.
He
'd
*NL*
have
all
he
could
get
.
And
it
's
impossible
to
say
what
he
could
n't
get
,
*NL*
if
he
gave
his
mind
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
falling
into
meditation
on
my
guardian
's
greatness
,
when
Wemmick
*NL*
remarked
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
absence
of
plate
,
that
's
only
his
natural
depth
,
you
know
.
*NL*
A
river
's
its
natural
depth
,
and
he
's
his
natural
depth
.
Look
at
his
*NL*
watch-chain
.
That
's
real
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
massive
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Massive
?
''
repeated
Wemmick
.
``
I
think
so
.
And
his
watch
is
a
gold
*NL*
repeater
,
and
worth
a
hundred
pound
if
it
's
worth
a
penny
.
Mr.
Pip
,
*NL*
there
are
about
seven
hundred
thieves
in
this
town
who
know
all
about
*NL*
that
watch
;
there
's
not
a
man
,
a
woman
,
or
a
child
,
among
them
,
who
*NL*
would
n't
identify
the
smallest
link
in
that
chain
,
and
drop
it
as
if
it
*NL*
was
red
hot
,
if
inveigled
into
touching
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
with
such
discourse
,
and
afterwards
with
conversation
of
a
more
*NL*
general
nature
,
did
Mr.
Wemmick
and
I
beguile
the
time
and
the
road
,
*NL*
until
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
we
had
arrived
in
the
district
of
*NL*
Walworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
to
be
a
collection
of
back
lanes
,
ditches
,
and
little
*NL*
gardens
,
and
to
present
the
aspect
of
a
rather
dull
retirement
.
*NL*
Wemmick
's
house
was
a
little
wooden
cottage
in
the
midst
of
plots
of
*NL*
garden
,
and
the
top
of
it
was
cut
out
and
painted
like
a
battery
mounted
*NL*
with
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
doing
,
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
Looks
pretty
;
do
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
highly
commended
it
,
I
think
it
was
the
smallest
house
I
ever
saw
;
*NL*
with
the
queerest
gothic
windows
-LRB-
by
far
the
greater
part
of
them
sham
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
a
gothic
door
almost
too
small
to
get
in
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
real
flagstaff
,
you
see
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
and
on
Sundays
I
*NL*
run
up
a
real
flag
.
Then
look
here
.
After
I
have
crossed
this
bridge
,
I
*NL*
hoist
it
up
--
so
--
and
cut
off
the
communication
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bridge
was
a
plank
,
and
it
crossed
a
chasm
about
four
feet
wide
*NL*
and
two
deep
.
But
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
the
pride
with
which
he
*NL*
hoisted
it
up
and
made
it
fast
;
smiling
as
he
did
so
,
with
a
relish
and
*NL*
not
merely
mechanically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
nine
o'clock
every
night
,
Greenwich
time
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
the
gun
*NL*
fires
.
There
he
is
,
you
see
!
And
when
you
hear
him
go
,
I
think
you
'll
*NL*
say
he
's
a
Stinger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
piece
of
ordnance
referred
to
,
was
mounted
in
a
separate
fortress
,
*NL*
constructed
of
lattice-work
.
It
was
protected
from
the
weather
by
an
*NL*
ingenious
little
tarpaulin
contrivance
in
the
nature
of
an
umbrella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
at
the
back
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
out
of
sight
,
so
as
not
to
impede
*NL*
the
idea
of
fortifications
,
--
for
it
's
a
principle
with
me
,
if
you
have
*NL*
an
idea
,
carry
it
out
and
keep
it
up
,
--
I
do
n't
know
whether
that
's
your
*NL*
opinion
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
At
the
back
,
there
's
a
pig
,
and
there
are
fowls
and
rabbits
;
then
,
*NL*
I
knock
together
my
own
little
frame
,
you
see
,
and
grow
cucumbers
;
and
*NL*
you
'll
judge
at
supper
what
sort
of
a
salad
I
can
raise
.
So
,
sir
,
''
said
*NL*
Wemmick
,
smiling
again
,
but
seriously
too
,
as
he
shook
his
head
,
``
if
you
*NL*
can
suppose
the
little
place
besieged
,
it
would
hold
out
a
devil
of
a
*NL*
time
in
point
of
provisions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
he
conducted
me
to
a
bower
about
a
dozen
yards
off
,
but
which
was
*NL*
approached
by
such
ingenious
twists
of
path
that
it
took
quite
a
long
*NL*
time
to
get
at
;
and
in
this
retreat
our
glasses
were
already
set
forth
.
*NL*
Our
punch
was
cooling
in
an
ornamental
lake
,
on
whose
margin
the
bower
*NL*
was
raised
.
This
piece
of
water
-LRB-
with
an
island
in
the
middle
which
*NL*
might
have
been
the
salad
for
supper
-RRB-
was
of
a
circular
form
,
and
he
had
*NL*
constructed
a
fountain
in
it
,
which
,
when
you
set
a
little
mill
going
*NL*
and
took
a
cork
out
of
a
pipe
,
played
to
that
powerful
extent
that
it
*NL*
made
the
back
of
your
hand
quite
wet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
my
own
engineer
,
and
my
own
carpenter
,
and
my
own
plumber
,
and
*NL*
my
own
gardener
,
and
my
own
Jack
of
all
Trades
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
in
*NL*
acknowledging
my
compliments
.
``
Well
;
it
's
a
good
thing
,
you
know
.
It
*NL*
brushes
the
Newgate
cobwebs
away
,
and
pleases
the
Aged
.
You
would
n't
*NL*
mind
being
at
once
introduced
to
the
Aged
,
would
you
?
It
would
n't
put
*NL*
you
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
expressed
the
readiness
I
felt
,
and
we
went
into
the
castle
.
There
*NL*
we
found
,
sitting
by
a
fire
,
a
very
old
man
in
a
flannel
coat
:
clean
,
*NL*
cheerful
,
comfortable
,
and
well
cared
for
,
but
intensely
deaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
aged
parent
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
shaking
hands
with
him
in
a
cordial
*NL*
and
jocose
way
,
``
how
am
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
John
;
all
right
!
''
replied
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Mr.
Pip
,
aged
parent
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
and
I
wish
you
could
hear
*NL*
his
name
.
Nod
away
at
him
,
Mr.
Pip
;
that
's
what
he
likes
.
Nod
away
at
*NL*
him
,
if
you
please
,
like
winking
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
fine
place
of
my
son
's
,
sir
,
''
cried
the
old
man
,
while
I
*NL*
nodded
as
hard
as
I
possibly
could
.
``
This
is
a
pretty
pleasure-ground
,
*NL*
sir
.
This
spot
and
these
beautiful
works
upon
it
ought
to
be
kept
*NL*
together
by
the
Nation
,
after
my
son
's
time
,
for
the
people
's
*NL*
enjoyment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
as
proud
of
it
as
Punch
;
ai
n't
you
,
Aged
?
''
said
Wemmick
,
*NL*
contemplating
the
old
man
,
with
his
hard
face
really
softened
;
``
there
's
*NL*
a
nod
for
you
;
''
giving
him
a
tremendous
one
;
``
there
's
another
for
you
;
''
*NL*
giving
him
a
still
more
tremendous
one
;
``
you
like
that
,
do
n't
you
?
If
*NL*
you
're
not
tired
,
Mr.
Pip
--
though
I
know
it
's
tiring
to
strangers
--
will
*NL*
you
tip
him
one
more
?
You
ca
n't
think
how
it
pleases
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tipped
him
several
more
,
and
he
was
in
great
spirits
.
We
left
him
*NL*
bestirring
himself
to
feed
the
fowls
,
and
we
sat
down
to
our
punch
in
*NL*
the
arbor
;
where
Wemmick
told
me
,
as
he
smoked
a
pipe
,
that
it
had
taken
*NL*
him
a
good
many
years
to
bring
the
property
up
to
its
present
pitch
of
*NL*
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
your
own
,
Mr.
Wemmick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
I
have
got
hold
of
it
,
a
bit
at
a
time
.
It
's
a
*NL*
freehold
,
by
George
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
indeed
?
I
hope
Mr.
Jaggers
admires
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
seen
it
,
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
Never
heard
of
it
.
Never
seen
the
Aged
.
*NL*
Never
heard
of
him
.
No
;
the
office
is
one
thing
,
and
private
life
is
*NL*
another
.
When
I
go
into
the
office
,
I
leave
the
Castle
behind
me
,
and
*NL*
when
I
come
into
the
Castle
,
I
leave
the
office
behind
me
.
If
it
's
not
*NL*
in
any
way
disagreeable
to
you
,
you
'll
oblige
me
by
doing
the
same
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
wish
it
professionally
spoken
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
felt
my
good
faith
involved
in
the
observance
of
his
*NL*
request
.
The
punch
being
very
nice
,
we
sat
there
drinking
it
and
*NL*
talking
,
until
it
was
almost
nine
o'clock
.
``
Getting
near
gun-fire
,
''
said
*NL*
Wemmick
then
,
as
he
laid
down
his
pipe
;
``
it
's
the
Aged
's
treat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Proceeding
into
the
Castle
again
,
we
found
the
Aged
heating
the
poker
,
*NL*
with
expectant
eyes
,
as
a
preliminary
to
the
performance
of
this
great
*NL*
nightly
ceremony
.
Wemmick
stood
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
until
the
*NL*
moment
was
come
for
him
to
take
the
red-hot
poker
from
the
Aged
,
and
*NL*
repair
to
the
battery
.
He
took
it
,
and
went
out
,
and
presently
the
*NL*
Stinger
went
off
with
a
Bang
that
shook
the
crazy
little
box
of
a
*NL*
cottage
as
if
it
must
fall
to
pieces
,
and
made
every
glass
and
teacup
in
*NL*
it
ring
.
Upon
this
,
the
Aged
--
who
I
believe
would
have
been
blown
out
*NL*
of
his
arm-chair
but
for
holding
on
by
the
elbows
--
cried
out
exultingly
,
*NL*
``
He
's
fired
!
I
heerd
him
!
''
and
I
nodded
at
the
old
gentleman
until
it
is
*NL*
no
figure
of
speech
to
declare
that
I
absolutely
could
not
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interval
between
that
time
and
supper
Wemmick
devoted
to
showing
*NL*
me
his
collection
of
curiosities
.
They
were
mostly
of
a
felonious
*NL*
character
;
comprising
the
pen
with
which
a
celebrated
forgery
had
been
*NL*
committed
,
a
distinguished
razor
or
two
,
some
locks
of
hair
,
and
several
*NL*
manuscript
confessions
written
under
condemnation
,
--
upon
which
Mr.
*NL*
Wemmick
set
particular
value
as
being
,
to
use
his
own
words
,
``
every
one
*NL*
of
'em
Lies
,
sir
.
''
These
were
agreeably
dispersed
among
small
specimens
*NL*
of
china
and
glass
,
various
neat
trifles
made
by
the
proprietor
of
the
*NL*
museum
,
and
some
tobacco-stoppers
carved
by
the
Aged
.
They
were
all
*NL*
displayed
in
that
chamber
of
the
Castle
into
which
I
had
been
first
*NL*
inducted
,
and
which
served
,
not
only
as
the
general
sitting-room
but
*NL*
as
the
kitchen
too
,
if
I
might
judge
from
a
saucepan
on
the
hob
,
and
*NL*
a
brazen
bijou
over
the
fireplace
designed
for
the
suspension
of
a
*NL*
roasting-jack
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
neat
little
girl
in
attendance
,
who
looked
after
the
Aged
in
*NL*
the
day
.
When
she
had
laid
the
supper-cloth
,
the
bridge
was
lowered
to
*NL*
give
her
means
of
egress
,
and
she
withdrew
for
the
night
.
The
supper
was
*NL*
excellent
;
and
though
the
Castle
was
rather
subject
to
dry-rot
insomuch
*NL*
that
it
tasted
like
a
bad
nut
,
and
though
the
pig
might
have
been
*NL*
farther
off
,
I
was
heartily
pleased
with
my
whole
entertainment
.
Nor
was
*NL*
there
any
drawback
on
my
little
turret
bedroom
,
beyond
there
being
such
*NL*
a
very
thin
ceiling
between
me
and
the
flagstaff
,
that
when
I
lay
down
*NL*
on
my
back
in
bed
,
it
seemed
as
if
I
had
to
balance
that
pole
on
my
*NL*
forehead
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
was
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
I
am
afraid
I
heard
him
*NL*
cleaning
my
boots
.
After
that
,
he
fell
to
gardening
,
and
I
saw
him
from
*NL*
my
gothic
window
pretending
to
employ
the
Aged
,
and
nodding
at
him
in
*NL*
a
most
devoted
manner
.
Our
breakfast
was
as
good
as
the
supper
,
and
at
*NL*
half-past
eight
precisely
we
started
for
Little
Britain
.
By
degrees
,
*NL*
Wemmick
got
dryer
and
harder
as
we
went
along
,
and
his
mouth
tightened
*NL*
into
a
post-office
again
.
At
last
,
when
we
got
to
his
place
of
business
*NL*
and
he
pulled
out
his
key
from
his
coat-collar
,
he
looked
as
unconscious
*NL*
of
his
Walworth
property
as
if
the
Castle
and
the
drawbridge
and
the
*NL*
arbor
and
the
lake
and
the
fountain
and
the
Aged
,
had
all
been
blown
*NL*
into
space
together
by
the
last
discharge
of
the
Stinger
.

Chapter
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
It
fell
out
as
Wemmick
had
told
me
it
would
,
that
I
had
an
early
*NL*
opportunity
of
comparing
my
guardian
's
establishment
with
that
of
his
*NL*
cashier
and
clerk
.
My
guardian
was
in
his
room
,
washing
his
hands
with
*NL*
his
scented
soap
,
when
I
went
into
the
office
from
Walworth
;
and
he
*NL*
called
me
to
him
,
and
gave
me
the
invitation
for
myself
and
friends
*NL*
which
Wemmick
had
prepared
me
to
receive
.
``
No
ceremony
,
''
he
stipulated
,
*NL*
``
and
no
dinner
dress
,
and
say
to-morrow
.
''
I
asked
him
where
we
should
*NL*
come
to
-LRB-
for
I
had
no
idea
where
he
lived
-RRB-
,
and
I
believe
it
was
in
his
*NL*
general
objection
to
make
anything
like
an
admission
,
that
he
replied
,
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
and
I
'll
take
you
home
with
me
.
''
I
embrace
this
opportunity
*NL*
of
remarking
that
he
washed
his
clients
off
,
as
if
he
were
a
surgeon
or
*NL*
a
dentist
.
He
had
a
closet
in
his
room
,
fitted
up
for
the
purpose
,
which
*NL*
smelt
of
the
scented
soap
like
a
perfumer
's
shop
.
It
had
an
unusually
*NL*
large
jack-towel
on
a
roller
inside
the
door
,
and
he
would
wash
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
wipe
them
and
dry
them
all
over
this
towel
,
whenever
he
came
*NL*
in
from
a
police
court
or
dismissed
a
client
from
his
room
.
When
I
and
*NL*
my
friends
repaired
to
him
at
six
o'clock
next
day
,
he
seemed
to
have
*NL*
been
engaged
on
a
case
of
a
darker
complexion
than
usual
,
for
we
found
*NL*
him
with
his
head
butted
into
this
closet
,
not
only
washing
his
hands
,
*NL*
but
laving
his
face
and
gargling
his
throat
.
And
even
when
he
had
*NL*
done
all
that
,
and
had
gone
all
round
the
jack-towel
,
he
took
out
his
*NL*
penknife
and
scraped
the
case
out
of
his
nails
before
he
put
his
coat
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
people
slinking
about
as
usual
when
we
passed
out
into
*NL*
the
street
,
who
were
evidently
anxious
to
speak
with
him
;
but
there
was
*NL*
something
so
conclusive
in
the
halo
of
scented
soap
which
encircled
*NL*
his
presence
,
that
they
gave
it
up
for
that
day
.
As
we
walked
along
*NL*
westward
,
he
was
recognized
ever
and
again
by
some
face
in
the
crowd
of
*NL*
the
streets
,
and
whenever
that
happened
he
talked
louder
to
me
;
but
*NL*
he
never
otherwise
recognized
anybody
,
or
took
notice
that
anybody
*NL*
recognized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
conducted
us
to
Gerrard
Street
,
Soho
,
to
a
house
on
the
south
side
of
*NL*
that
street
.
Rather
a
stately
house
of
its
kind
,
but
dolefully
in
want
*NL*
of
painting
,
and
with
dirty
windows
.
He
took
out
his
key
and
opened
the
*NL*
door
,
and
we
all
went
into
a
stone
hall
,
bare
,
gloomy
,
and
little
used
.
*NL*
So
,
up
a
dark
brown
staircase
into
a
series
of
three
dark
brown
rooms
on
*NL*
the
first
floor
.
There
were
carved
garlands
on
the
panelled
walls
,
and
*NL*
as
he
stood
among
them
giving
us
welcome
,
I
know
what
kind
of
loops
I
*NL*
thought
they
looked
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
was
laid
in
the
best
of
these
rooms
;
the
second
was
his
*NL*
dressing-room
;
the
third
,
his
bedroom
.
He
told
us
that
he
held
the
whole
*NL*
house
,
but
rarely
used
more
of
it
than
we
saw
.
The
table
was
comfortably
*NL*
laid
--
no
silver
in
the
service
,
of
course
--
and
at
the
side
of
his
chair
*NL*
was
a
capacious
dumb-waiter
,
with
a
variety
of
bottles
and
decanters
on
*NL*
it
,
and
four
dishes
of
fruit
for
dessert
.
I
noticed
throughout
,
that
he
*NL*
kept
everything
under
his
own
hand
,
and
distributed
everything
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
bookcase
in
the
room
;
I
saw
from
the
backs
of
the
books
,
*NL*
that
they
were
about
evidence
,
criminal
law
,
criminal
biography
,
trials
,
*NL*
acts
of
Parliament
,
and
such
things
.
The
furniture
was
all
very
solid
*NL*
and
good
,
like
his
watch-chain
.
It
had
an
official
look
,
however
,
and
*NL*
there
was
nothing
merely
ornamental
to
be
seen
.
In
a
corner
was
a
little
*NL*
table
of
papers
with
a
shaded
lamp
:
so
that
he
seemed
to
bring
the
*NL*
office
home
with
him
in
that
respect
too
,
and
to
wheel
it
out
of
an
*NL*
evening
and
fall
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
scarcely
seen
my
three
companions
until
now
,
--
for
he
and
I
had
*NL*
walked
together
,
--
he
stood
on
the
hearth-rug
,
after
ringing
the
bell
,
*NL*
and
took
a
searching
look
at
them
.
To
my
surprise
,
he
seemed
at
once
to
*NL*
be
principally
if
not
solely
interested
in
Drummle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
''
said
he
,
putting
his
large
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
moving
me
to
*NL*
the
window
,
``
I
do
n't
know
one
from
the
other
.
Who
's
the
Spider
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
spider
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
blotchy
,
sprawly
,
sulky
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Bentley
Drummle
,
''
I
replied
;
``
the
one
with
the
delicate
face
is
*NL*
Startop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
making
the
least
account
of
``
the
one
with
the
delicate
face
,
''
he
*NL*
returned
,
``
Bentley
Drummle
is
his
name
,
is
it
?
I
like
the
look
of
that
*NL*
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
began
to
talk
to
Drummle
:
not
at
all
deterred
by
his
*NL*
replying
in
his
heavy
reticent
way
,
but
apparently
led
on
by
it
to
screw
*NL*
discourse
out
of
him
.
I
was
looking
at
the
two
,
when
there
came
between
*NL*
me
and
them
the
housekeeper
,
with
the
first
dish
for
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
woman
of
about
forty
,
I
supposed
,
--
but
I
may
have
thought
her
*NL*
younger
than
she
was
.
Rather
tall
,
of
a
lithe
nimble
figure
,
extremely
*NL*
pale
,
with
large
faded
eyes
,
and
a
quantity
of
streaming
hair
.
I
can
not
*NL*
say
whether
any
diseased
affection
of
the
heart
caused
her
lips
to
be
*NL*
parted
as
if
she
were
panting
,
and
her
face
to
bear
a
curious
expression
*NL*
of
suddenness
and
flutter
;
but
I
know
that
I
had
been
to
see
Macbeth
at
*NL*
the
theatre
,
a
night
or
two
before
,
and
that
her
face
looked
to
me
as
if
*NL*
it
were
all
disturbed
by
fiery
air
,
like
the
faces
I
had
seen
rise
out
*NL*
of
the
Witches
'
caldron
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
the
dish
on
,
touched
my
guardian
quietly
on
the
arm
with
a
*NL*
finger
to
notify
that
dinner
was
ready
,
and
vanished
.
We
took
our
seats
*NL*
at
the
round
table
,
and
my
guardian
kept
Drummle
on
one
side
of
him
,
*NL*
while
Startop
sat
on
the
other
.
It
was
a
noble
dish
of
fish
that
the
*NL*
housekeeper
had
put
on
table
,
and
we
had
a
joint
of
equally
choice
*NL*
mutton
afterwards
,
and
then
an
equally
choice
bird
.
Sauces
,
wines
,
all
*NL*
the
accessories
we
wanted
,
and
all
of
the
best
,
were
given
out
by
our
*NL*
host
from
his
dumb-waiter
;
and
when
they
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
*NL*
table
,
he
always
put
them
back
again
.
Similarly
,
he
dealt
us
clean
*NL*
plates
and
knives
and
forks
,
for
each
course
,
and
dropped
those
just
*NL*
disused
into
two
baskets
on
the
ground
by
his
chair
.
No
other
attendant
*NL*
than
the
housekeeper
appeared
.
She
set
on
every
dish
;
and
I
always
saw
*NL*
in
her
face
,
a
face
rising
out
of
the
caldron
.
Years
afterwards
,
I
made
*NL*
a
dreadful
likeness
of
that
woman
,
by
causing
a
face
that
had
no
other
*NL*
natural
resemblance
to
it
than
it
derived
from
flowing
hair
to
pass
*NL*
behind
a
bowl
of
flaming
spirits
in
a
dark
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Induced
to
take
particular
notice
of
the
housekeeper
,
both
by
her
*NL*
own
striking
appearance
and
by
Wemmick
's
preparation
,
I
observed
*NL*
that
whenever
she
was
in
the
room
she
kept
her
eyes
attentively
on
my
*NL*
guardian
,
and
that
she
would
remove
her
hands
from
any
dish
she
put
*NL*
before
him
,
hesitatingly
,
as
if
she
dreaded
his
calling
her
back
,
and
*NL*
wanted
him
to
speak
when
she
was
nigh
,
if
he
had
anything
to
say
.
I
*NL*
fancied
that
I
could
detect
in
his
manner
a
consciousness
of
this
,
and
a
*NL*
purpose
of
always
holding
her
in
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
went
off
gayly
,
and
although
my
guardian
seemed
to
follow
rather
*NL*
than
originate
subjects
,
I
knew
that
he
wrenched
the
weakest
part
of
*NL*
our
dispositions
out
of
us
.
For
myself
,
I
found
that
I
was
expressing
my
*NL*
tendency
to
lavish
expenditure
,
and
to
patronize
Herbert
,
and
to
boast
*NL*
of
my
great
prospects
,
before
I
quite
knew
that
I
had
opened
my
lips
.
*NL*
It
was
so
with
all
of
us
,
but
with
no
one
more
than
Drummle
:
the
*NL*
development
of
whose
inclination
to
gird
in
a
grudging
and
suspicious
*NL*
way
at
the
rest
,
was
screwed
out
of
him
before
the
fish
was
taken
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
then
,
but
when
we
had
got
to
the
cheese
,
that
our
*NL*
conversation
turned
upon
our
rowing
feats
,
and
that
Drummle
was
rallied
*NL*
for
coming
up
behind
of
a
night
in
that
slow
amphibious
way
of
his
.
*NL*
Drummle
upon
this
,
informed
our
host
that
he
much
preferred
our
room
to
*NL*
our
company
,
and
that
as
to
skill
he
was
more
than
our
master
,
and
that
*NL*
as
to
strength
he
could
scatter
us
like
chaff
.
By
some
invisible
agency
,
*NL*
my
guardian
wound
him
up
to
a
pitch
little
short
of
ferocity
about
this
*NL*
trifle
;
and
he
fell
to
baring
and
spanning
his
arm
to
show
how
muscular
*NL*
it
was
,
and
we
all
fell
to
baring
and
spanning
our
arms
in
a
ridiculous
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
housekeeper
was
at
that
time
clearing
the
table
;
my
guardian
,
*NL*
taking
no
heed
of
her
,
but
with
the
side
of
his
face
turned
from
her
,
*NL*
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
biting
the
side
of
his
forefinger
and
*NL*
showing
an
interest
in
Drummle
,
that
,
to
me
,
was
quite
inexplicable
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
he
clapped
his
large
hand
on
the
housekeeper
's
,
like
a
trap
,
*NL*
as
she
stretched
it
across
the
table
.
So
suddenly
and
smartly
did
he
do
*NL*
this
,
that
we
all
stopped
in
our
foolish
contention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
talk
of
strength
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
I
'll
show
you
a
wrist
.
*NL*
Molly
,
let
them
see
your
wrist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
entrapped
hand
was
on
the
table
,
but
she
had
already
put
her
other
*NL*
hand
behind
her
waist
.
``
Master
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
with
her
eyes
*NL*
attentively
and
entreatingly
fixed
upon
him
.
``
Do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
show
you
a
wrist
,
''
repeated
Mr.
Jaggers
,
with
an
immovable
*NL*
determination
to
show
it
.
``
Molly
,
let
them
see
your
wrist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
,
''
she
again
murmured
.
``
Please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Molly
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
not
looking
at
her
,
but
obstinately
looking
*NL*
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
,
``
let
them
see
both
your
wrists
.
Show
*NL*
them
.
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
hand
from
hers
,
and
turned
that
wrist
up
on
the
table
.
She
*NL*
brought
her
other
hand
from
behind
her
,
and
held
the
two
out
side
by
*NL*
side
.
The
last
wrist
was
much
disfigured
,
--
deeply
scarred
and
scarred
*NL*
across
and
across
.
When
she
held
her
hands
out
she
took
her
eyes
from
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
,
and
turned
them
watchfully
on
every
one
of
the
rest
of
us
*NL*
in
succession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
power
here
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
coolly
tracing
out
the
sinews
*NL*
with
his
forefinger
.
``
Very
few
men
have
the
power
of
wrist
that
this
*NL*
woman
has
.
It
's
remarkable
what
mere
force
of
grip
there
is
in
these
*NL*
hands
.
I
have
had
occasion
to
notice
many
hands
;
but
I
never
saw
*NL*
stronger
in
that
respect
,
man
's
or
woman
's
,
than
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
said
these
words
in
a
leisurely
,
critical
style
,
she
continued
*NL*
to
look
at
every
one
of
us
in
regular
succession
as
we
sat
.
The
moment
*NL*
he
ceased
,
she
looked
at
him
again
.
``
That
'll
do
,
Molly
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
,
giving
her
a
slight
nod
;
``
you
have
been
admired
,
and
can
*NL*
go
.
''
She
withdrew
her
hands
and
went
out
of
the
room
,
and
Mr.
Jaggers
,
*NL*
putting
the
decanters
on
from
his
dumb-waiter
,
filled
his
glass
and
*NL*
passed
round
the
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
half-past
nine
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
must
break
up
.
Pray
make
*NL*
the
best
use
of
your
time
.
I
am
glad
to
see
you
all
.
Mr.
Drummle
,
I
*NL*
drink
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
his
object
in
singling
out
Drummle
were
to
bring
him
out
still
more
,
*NL*
it
perfectly
succeeded
.
In
a
sulky
triumph
,
Drummle
showed
his
morose
*NL*
depreciation
of
the
rest
of
us
,
in
a
more
and
more
offensive
degree
,
*NL*
until
he
became
downright
intolerable
.
Through
all
his
stages
,
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
followed
him
with
the
same
strange
interest
.
He
actually
seemed
*NL*
to
serve
as
a
zest
to
Mr.
Jaggers
's
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
our
boyish
want
of
discretion
I
dare
say
we
took
too
much
to
drink
,
*NL*
and
I
know
we
talked
too
much
.
We
became
particularly
hot
upon
some
*NL*
boorish
sneer
of
Drummle
's
,
to
the
effect
that
we
were
too
free
with
our
*NL*
money
.
It
led
to
my
remarking
,
with
more
zeal
than
discretion
,
that
it
*NL*
came
with
a
bad
grace
from
him
,
to
whom
Startop
had
lent
money
in
my
*NL*
presence
but
a
week
or
so
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
retorted
Drummle
;
``
he
'll
be
paid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
to
imply
that
he
wo
n't
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
it
might
make
you
*NL*
hold
your
tongue
about
us
and
our
money
,
I
should
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
think
!
''
retorted
Drummle
.
``
Oh
Lord
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
,
''
I
went
on
,
meaning
to
be
very
severe
,
``
that
you
would
n't
*NL*
lend
money
to
any
of
us
if
we
wanted
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
Drummle
.
``
I
would
n't
lend
one
of
you
a
sixpence
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
lend
anybody
a
sixpence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
mean
to
borrow
under
those
circumstances
,
I
should
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
say
,
''
repeated
Drummle
.
``
Oh
Lord
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
so
very
aggravating
--
the
more
especially
as
I
found
myself
*NL*
making
no
way
against
his
surly
obtuseness
--
that
I
said
,
disregarding
*NL*
Herbert
's
efforts
to
check
me
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Mr.
Drummle
,
since
we
are
on
the
subject
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
*NL*
passed
between
Herbert
here
and
me
,
when
you
borrowed
that
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
know
what
passed
between
Herbert
there
and
you
,
''
*NL*
growled
Drummle
.
And
I
think
he
added
in
a
lower
growl
,
that
we
might
*NL*
both
go
to
the
devil
and
shake
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
however
,
''
said
I
,
``
whether
you
want
to
know
or
not
.
We
*NL*
said
that
as
you
put
it
in
your
pocket
very
glad
to
get
it
,
you
seemed
*NL*
to
be
immensely
amused
at
his
being
so
weak
as
to
lend
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drummle
laughed
outright
,
and
sat
laughing
in
our
faces
,
with
his
hands
*NL*
in
his
pockets
and
his
round
shoulders
raised
;
plainly
signifying
that
*NL*
it
was
quite
true
,
and
that
he
despised
us
as
asses
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
Startop
took
him
in
hand
,
though
with
a
much
better
grace
than
*NL*
I
had
shown
,
and
exhorted
him
to
be
a
little
more
agreeable
.
Startop
,
*NL*
being
a
lively
,
bright
young
fellow
,
and
Drummle
being
the
exact
*NL*
opposite
,
the
latter
was
always
disposed
to
resent
him
as
a
direct
*NL*
personal
affront
.
He
now
retorted
in
a
coarse
,
lumpish
way
,
and
Startop
*NL*
tried
to
turn
the
discussion
aside
with
some
small
pleasantry
that
made
*NL*
us
all
laugh
.
Resenting
this
little
success
more
than
anything
,
Drummle
,
*NL*
without
any
threat
or
warning
,
pulled
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
,
*NL*
dropped
his
round
shoulders
,
swore
,
took
up
a
large
glass
,
and
would
*NL*
have
flung
it
at
his
adversary
's
head
,
but
for
our
entertainer
's
*NL*
dexterously
seizing
it
at
the
instant
when
it
was
raised
for
that
*NL*
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
deliberately
putting
down
the
glass
,
and
*NL*
hauling
out
his
gold
repeater
by
its
massive
chain
,
``
I
am
exceedingly
*NL*
sorry
to
announce
that
it
's
half
past
nine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
hint
we
all
rose
to
depart
.
Before
we
got
to
the
street
door
,
*NL*
Startop
was
cheerily
calling
Drummle
``
old
boy
,
''
as
if
nothing
had
*NL*
happened
.
But
the
old
boy
was
so
far
from
responding
,
that
he
would
not
*NL*
even
walk
to
Hammersmith
on
the
same
side
of
the
way
;
so
Herbert
and
I
,
*NL*
who
remained
in
town
,
saw
them
going
down
the
street
on
opposite
sides
;
*NL*
Startop
leading
,
and
Drummle
lagging
behind
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
,
*NL*
much
as
he
was
wont
to
follow
in
his
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
door
was
not
yet
shut
,
I
thought
I
would
leave
Herbert
there
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
and
run
upstairs
again
to
say
a
word
to
my
guardian
.
I
found
*NL*
him
in
his
dressing-room
surrounded
by
his
stock
of
boots
,
already
hard
*NL*
at
it
,
washing
his
hands
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
had
come
up
again
to
say
how
sorry
I
was
that
anything
*NL*
disagreeable
should
have
occurred
,
and
that
I
hoped
he
would
not
blame
*NL*
me
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
''
said
he
,
sluicing
his
face
,
and
speaking
through
the
*NL*
water-drops
;
``
it
's
nothing
,
Pip
.
I
like
that
Spider
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
turned
towards
me
now
,
and
was
shaking
his
head
,
and
blowing
,
and
*NL*
towelling
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
like
him
,
sir
,
''
said
I
--
``
but
I
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
my
guardian
assented
;
``
do
n't
have
too
much
to
do
with
him
.
*NL*
Keep
as
clear
of
him
as
you
can
.
But
I
like
the
fellow
,
Pip
;
he
is
one
*NL*
of
the
true
sort
.
Why
,
if
I
was
a
fortune-teller
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
out
of
the
towel
,
he
caught
my
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
not
a
fortune-teller
,
''
he
said
,
letting
his
head
drop
into
a
*NL*
festoon
of
towel
,
and
towelling
away
at
his
two
ears
.
``
You
know
what
I
*NL*
am
,
do
n't
you
?
Good
night
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
a
month
after
that
,
the
Spider
's
time
with
Mr.
Pocket
was
up
*NL*
for
good
,
and
,
to
the
great
relief
of
all
the
house
but
Mrs.
Pocket
,
he
*NL*
went
home
to
the
family
hole

MY

*NL*
*NL*

for
to

London
in
company
with
Mr.

and
would
be
glad
if
*NL*
agreeable
to
be
allowed

see
you

He
would
call
at
Barnard

Tuesday

at
nine
o'clock

when
if
not
agreeable
please
leave
*NL*

Your
poor

is
much
the
same
as
when
you
left

We
talk
of
you
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
every
night
,
and
wonder
what
you
are
saying

doing

If
*NL*
now
considered
in
the
light
of
a
liberty

excuse
it
for
the
love
of
*NL*
poor
old

,
excepting

last
little
*NL*
sentence
,
and

wishes
me
most
particular
to
write

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
received
this
letter
by
the
post
on
Monday
morning
,
and
therefore
its
*NL*
appointment
was
for
next
day
.
Let
me
confess
exactly
with
what
feelings
*NL*
I
looked
forward
to
Joe
's
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
with
pleasure
,
though
I
was
bound
to
him
by
so
many
ties
;
no
;
*NL*
with
considerable
disturbance
,
some
mortification
,
and
a
keen
sense
of
*NL*
incongruity
.
If
I
could
have
kept
him
away
by
paying
money
,
I
certainly
*NL*
would
have
paid
money
.
My
greatest
reassurance
was
that
he
was
coming
*NL*
to
Barnard
's
Inn
,
not
to
Hammersmith
,
and
consequently
would
not
fall
*NL*
in
Bentley
Drummle
's
way
.
I
had
little
objection
to
his
being
seen
by
*NL*
Herbert
or
his
father
,
for
both
of
whom
I
had
a
respect
;
but
I
had
the
*NL*
sharpest
sensitiveness
as
to
his
being
seen
by
Drummle
,
whom
I
held
in
*NL*
contempt
.
So
,
throughout
life
,
our
worst
weaknesses
and
meannesses
are
*NL*
usually
committed
for
the
sake
of
the
people
whom
we
most
despise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
begun
to
be
always
decorating
the
chambers
in
some
quite
*NL*
unnecessary
and
inappropriate
way
or
other
,
and
very
expensive
those
*NL*
wrestles
with
Barnard
proved
to
be
.
By
this
time
,
the
rooms
were
*NL*
vastly
different
from
what
I
had
found
them
,
and
I
enjoyed
the
honor
*NL*
of
occupying
a
few
prominent
pages
in
the
books
of
a
neighboring
*NL*
upholsterer
.
I
had
got
on
so
fast
of
late
,
that
I
had
even
started
a
boy
*NL*
in
boots
,
--
top
boots
,
--
in
bondage
and
slavery
to
whom
I
might
have
been
*NL*
said
to
pass
my
days
.
For
,
after
I
had
made
the
monster
-LRB-
out
of
the
*NL*
refuse
of
my
washerwoman
's
family
-RRB-
,
and
had
clothed
him
with
a
blue
*NL*
coat
,
canary
waistcoat
,
white
cravat
,
creamy
breeches
,
and
the
boots
*NL*
already
mentioned
,
I
had
to
find
him
a
little
to
do
and
a
great
deal
*NL*
to
eat
;
and
with
both
of
those
horrible
requirements
he
haunted
my
*NL*
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
avenging
phantom
was
ordered
to
be
on
duty
at
eight
on
Tuesday
*NL*
morning
in
the
hall
,
-LRB-
it
was
two
feet
square
,
as
charged
for
*NL*
floorcloth
,
-RRB-
and
Herbert
suggested
certain
things
for
breakfast
that
he
*NL*
thought
Joe
would
like
.
While
I
felt
sincerely
obliged
to
him
for
being
*NL*
so
interested
and
considerate
,
I
had
an
odd
half-provoked
sense
of
*NL*
suspicion
upon
me
,
that
if
Joe
had
been
coming
to
see
him
,
he
would
n't
*NL*
have
been
quite
so
brisk
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
came
into
town
on
the
Monday
night
to
be
ready
for
Joe
,
and
*NL*
I
got
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
caused
the
sitting-room
and
*NL*
breakfast-table
to
assume
their
most
splendid
appearance
.
Unfortunately
*NL*
the
morning
was
drizzly
,
and
an
angel
could
not
have
concealed
the
fact
*NL*
that
Barnard
was
shedding
sooty
tears
outside
the
window
,
like
some
weak
*NL*
giant
of
a
Sweep
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
time
approached
I
should
have
liked
to
run
away
,
but
the
Avenger
*NL*
pursuant
to
orders
was
in
the
hall
,
and
presently
I
heard
Joe
on
*NL*
the
staircase
.
I
knew
it
was
Joe
,
by
his
clumsy
manner
of
coming
upstairs
,
*NL*
--
his
state
boots
being
always
too
big
for
him
,
--
and
by
the
time
*NL*
it
took
him
to
read
the
names
on
the
other
floors
in
the
course
of
*NL*
his
ascent
.
When
at
last
he
stopped
outside
our
door
,
I
could
hear
his
*NL*
finger
tracing
over
the
painted
letters
of
my
name
,
and
I
afterwards
*NL*
distinctly
heard
him
breathing
in
at
the
keyhole
.
Finally
he
gave
a
*NL*
faint
single
rap
,
and
Pepper
--
such
was
the
compromising
name
of
the
*NL*
avenging
boy
--
announced
``
Mr.
Gargery
!
''
I
thought
he
never
would
have
*NL*
done
wiping
his
feet
,
and
that
I
must
have
gone
out
to
lift
him
off
the
*NL*
mat
,
but
at
last
he
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joe
,
how
are
you
,
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
how
AIR
you
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
his
good
honest
face
all
glowing
and
shining
,
and
his
hat
put
*NL*
down
on
the
floor
between
us
,
he
caught
both
my
hands
and
worked
them
*NL*
straight
up
and
down
,
as
if
I
had
been
the
last-patented
Pump
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
Joe
.
Give
me
your
hat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Joe
,
taking
it
up
carefully
with
both
hands
,
like
a
bird
's
-
nest
with
*NL*
eggs
in
it
,
would
n't
hear
of
parting
with
that
piece
of
property
,
and
*NL*
persisted
in
standing
talking
over
it
in
a
most
uncomfortable
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
you
have
that
growed
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
and
that
swelled
,
and
that
*NL*
gentle-folked
;
''
Joe
considered
a
little
before
he
discovered
this
word
;
*NL*
``
as
to
be
sure
you
are
a
honor
to
your
king
and
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Joe
,
look
wonderfully
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
I
'm
ekerval
to
most
.
And
your
sister
,
she
's
*NL*
no
worse
than
she
were

And
Biddy
,

right
and

's
had

*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
-LRB-
still
with
both
hands
taking
great
care
of
the
*NL*
bird
's
-
nest
-RRB-
,
Joe
was
rolling
his
eyes
round
and
round
the
room
,
and
*NL*
round
and
round
the
flowered
pattern
of
my
dressing-gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
a
drop
,
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
yes
,
''
said
Joe
,
lowering
his
voice
,
``
he
's
left
the
Church
and
went
*NL*
into
the
playacting

Which
the
playacting
have
likeways
brought
him
*NL*
to
London
along
with
me
.
And
his
wish

''
said
Joe
,
getting
the
*NL*
bird
's
-
nest
under
his
left
arm
for
the
moment
,
and
groping
in
it
for
an
*NL*
egg
with
his
right
;
``
if
no
offence
,
as
I
would
`
and
you
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
what
Joe
gave
me
,
and
found
it
to
be
the
crumpled
play-bill
of
*NL*
a
small
metropolitan
theatre
,
announcing
the
first
appearance
,
in
that
*NL*
very
week
,
of
``
the
celebrated
Provincial
Amateur
of
Roscian
renown
,
*NL*
whose
unique
performance
in
the
highest
tragic
walk
of

Bard
*NL*
has
lately
occasioned
so
great
a
sensation
in
local
dramatic
circles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
at

performance
,
Joe
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
were

''
said
Joe
,
with
emphasis
and
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
there
a
great
sensation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
yes
,
there
certainly
were
a
peck
of
orange-peel

*NL*

I
put
it
to
yourself

*NL*
whether
it
were
calc
`
lated
to
keep
a
man
up
to
his
work
with
a
good
*NL*
hart
,
to
be
continiwally
cutting
in
betwixt
him
and
the
Ghost
with
*NL*
``
Amen
!
''
A
man
may
have
had
a
misfortun
'
and
been
in
the
Church
,
''
said
*NL*
Joe
,
lowering
his
voice
to
an
argumentative
and
feeling
tone
,
``
but
*NL*
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
put
him
out
at
such
a
time

I
*NL*
meantersay
,
if
the
ghost

a
man
's
own
father
can
not
be
allowed
to
*NL*
claim
his
attention
,
what
can
,
Sir

Still
more
,
when
his
mourning
`
at
*NL*
is
unfortunately
made
so
small
as
that
the
weight
of
the
black
feathers
*NL*
brings
it
off
,
try
to
keep
it
on
how
you
may

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
ghost-seeing
effect
in
Joe
's
own
countenance
informed
me
that
Herbert
*NL*
had
entered
the
room
.
So
,
I
presented
Joe
to
Herbert
,
who
held
out
his
*NL*
hand
;
but
Joe
backed
from
it
,
and
held
on
by
the
bird
's
-
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
servant
,
Sir

said
Joe
,
``
which
I
hope
as
you
and
Pip

--
here
his
*NL*
eye
fell
on
the
Avenger
,
who
was
putting
some
toast
on
table
,
and
so
*NL*
plainly
denoted
an
intention
to
make
that
young
gentleman
one
of
the
*NL*
family
,
that
I
frowned
it
down
and
confused
him
more
--
``
I
meantersay
,
you
*NL*
two
gentlemen

which
I
hope
as
you
get
your

the
present
may
be

good

opinions

*NL*
said
Joe
,
confidentially
,
``
and
I
believe
its
character
do
stand
it
;
but
I
*NL*
would
n't
keep
a

not
in

*NL*
*NL*
Having
borne
this
flattering
testimony
to
the
merits
of
our
*NL*
dwelling-place
,
and
having
incidentally
shown
this
tendency
to
call
me
*NL*
``
sir
,
''
Joe
,
being
invited
to
sit
down
to
table
,
looked
all
round
the
*NL*
room
for
a
suitable
spot
on
which
to
deposit
his
hat
,
--
as
if
it
were
*NL*
only
on
some
very
few
rare
substances
in
nature
that
it
could
find
a
*NL*
resting
place
,

and
ultimately
stood
it
on
an
extreme
corner
of
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
from
which
it
ever
afterwards
fell
off
at
intervals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
take
tea
,
or
coffee
,
Mr.
Gargery
?
''
asked
Herbert
,
who
always
*NL*
presided
of
a
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
,
Sir
,
''
said
Joe
,
stiff
from
head
to
foot
,
``
I
'll
take
whichever
*NL*
is
most
agreeable
to
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
to
coffee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
,
Sir
,
''
returned
Joe
,
evidently
dispirited
by
the
proposal
,
*NL*
``
since
you
are
so
kind
as
make
chice
of
coffee
,
I
will
not
run
contrairy
*NL*
to
your
own
opinions
.
But
do
n't
you
never
find
it
a
little
`
eating
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
tea
then
,
''
said
Herbert
,
pouring
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Joe
's
hat
tumbled
off
the
mantel-piece
,
and
he
started
out
of
his
*NL*
chair
and
picked
it
up
,
and
fitted
it
to
the
same
exact
spot
.
As
if
it
*NL*
were
an
absolute
point
of
good
breeding
that
it
should
tumble
off
again
*NL*
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
come
to
town
,
Mr.
Gargery
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
it
yesterday
afternoon
?
''
said
Joe
,
after
coughing
behind
his
hand
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
had
time
to
catch
the
whooping-cough
since
he
came
.
``
No
*NL*
it
were
not
.
Yes
it
were
.
Yes
.
It
were
yesterday
afternoon
''
-LRB-
with
an
*NL*
appearance
of
mingled
wisdom
,
relief
,
and
strict
impartiality
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
anything
of
London
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
Sir
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
me
and
Wopsle
went
off
straight
to
look
at
*NL*
the
Blacking
Ware'us
.
But
we
did
n't
find
that
it
come
up
to
its
likeness
*NL*
in
the
red
bills
at
the
shop
doors
;
which
I
meantersay
,
''
added
Joe
,
in
*NL*
an
explanatory
manner
,
``
as
it
is
there
drawd
too
architectooralooral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
believe
Joe
would
have
prolonged
this
word
-LRB-
mightily
expressive
*NL*
to
my
mind
of
some
architecture
that
I
know
-RRB-
into
a
perfect
Chorus
,
but
*NL*
for
his
attention
being
providentially
attracted
by
his
hat
,
which
*NL*
was
toppling
.
Indeed
,
it
demanded
from
him
a
constant
attention
,
and
a
*NL*
quickness
of
eye
and
hand
,
very
like
that
exacted
by
wicket-keeping
.
*NL*
He
made
extraordinary
play
with
it
,
and
showed
the
greatest
skill
;
now
,
*NL*
rushing
at
it
and
catching
it
neatly
as
it
dropped
;
now
,
merely
stopping
*NL*
it
midway
,
beating
it
up
,
and
humoring
it
in
various
parts
of
the
room
*NL*
and
against
a
good
deal
of
the
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
,
*NL*
before
he
felt
it
safe
to
close
with
it
;
finally
splashing
it
into
the
*NL*
slop-basin
,
where
I
took
the
liberty
of
laying
hands
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
his
shirt-collar
,
and
his
coat-collar
,
they
were
perplexing
to
*NL*
reflect
upon
,
--
insoluble
mysteries
both
.
Why
should
a
man
scrape
himself
*NL*
to
that
extent
,
before
he
could
consider
himself
full
dressed
?
Why
*NL*
should
he
suppose
it
necessary
to
be
purified
by
suffering
for
*NL*
his
holiday
clothes
?
Then
he
fell
into
such
unaccountable
fits
of
*NL*
meditation
,
with
his
fork
midway
between
his
plate
and
his
mouth
;
had
*NL*
his
eyes
attracted
in
such
strange
directions
;
was
afflicted
with
such
*NL*
remarkable
coughs
;
sat
so
far
from
the
table
,
and
dropped
so
much
*NL*
more
than
he
ate
,
and
pretended
that
he
had
n't
dropped
it
;
that
I
was
*NL*
heartily
glad
when
Herbert
left
us
for
the
City
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
neither
the
good
sense
nor
the
good
feeling
to
know
that
this
was
*NL*
all
my
fault
,
and
that
if
I
had
been
easier
with
Joe
,
Joe
would
have
*NL*
been
easier
with
me
.
I
felt
impatient
of
him
and
out
of
temper
with
him
;
*NL*
in
which
condition
he
heaped
coals
of
fire
on
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Us
two
being
now
alone
,
sir
,
''
--
began
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joe
,
''
I
interrupted
,
pettishly
,
``
how
can
you
call
me
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
looked
at
me
for
a
single
instant
with
something
faintly
like
*NL*
reproach
.
Utterly
preposterous
as
his
cravat
was
,
and
as
his
collars
*NL*
were
,
I
was
conscious
of
a
sort
of
dignity
in
the
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Us
two
being
now
alone
,
''
resumed
Joe
,
``
and
me
having
the
intentions
and
*NL*
abilities
to
stay
not
many
minutes
more
,
I
will
now
conclude
--
leastways
*NL*
begin
--
to
mention
what
have
led
to
my
having
had
the
present
honor
.
For
*NL*
was
it
not
,
''
said
Joe
,
with
his
old
air
of
lucid
exposition
,
``
that
my
*NL*
only
wish
were
to
be
useful
to
you

I
should
not
have
had
the

breaking
wittles
in

company
and

of

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
unwilling
to
see
the
look
again
,
that
I
made
no
remonstrance
*NL*
against
this
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

pursued
Joe
,
``

--
whenever
he
subsided
into
affection
,
he
called
me
*NL*
Pip
,
and
whenever
he
relapsed
into
politeness
he
called
me

going
down
a
new
track

were
making
his

*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
my
face
fire
up
as
I
looked
at

I
hope
one
remote

Joe

rising
from

``

*NL*
*NL*
Our

met
,
and
all
the
``

''
melted
out
of
that
manly
heart
as
he
gave
*NL*
me
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
dear
old
chap
,
life
is
made
of
ever
so
many
partings
welded
*NL*
together
,
as
I
may
say
,
and
one
man
's
a
blacksmith
,
and
one
's
a
*NL*
whitesmith
,
and
one
's
a
goldsmith
,
and
one
's
a
coppersmith
.
Diwisions
*NL*
among
such
must
come
,
and
must
be
met
as
they
come
.
If
there
's
been
*NL*
any
fault
at
all
to-day

it

mine

You
and
me
is
not
two
figures

*NL*
be
together
in
London
;
nor
yet
anywheres
else
but
what
is
private
,
and
*NL*
beknown
,
and
understood
among
friends

It
ai
n't
that
I
am
proud
,
but
*NL*
that
I
want
to
be
right
,
as
you
shall
never
see
me
no
more
in
these
*NL*
clothes

I
'm
wrong
in
these
clothes

I
'm
wrong
out
of
the
forge

the

kitchen

or
off

You
wo
n't
find
half
so
much

you
think

my

You

supposing
as
you
*NL*
should
ever
wish
to
see
me
,
you
come
and
put
your
head
in
at

window

there

at
the
old
anvil

in
the
old
*NL*
burnt
apron

sticking
to
the
old
work

I
'm
awful
dull

I
hope
I
've
*NL*
beat
out
something
nigh
the
rights

this
at

bless

you

old

*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
been
mistaken
in
my
fancy
that
there
was
a
simple
dignity
*NL*
in
him
.
The
fashion
of
his
dress
could
no
more
come
in
its
way
when
he
*NL*
spoke
these
words
than
it
could
come
in
its
way
in
Heaven
.
He
touched
me
*NL*
gently
on
the
forehead
,
and
went
out
.
As
soon
as
I
could
recover
*NL*
myself
sufficiently
,
I
hurried
out
after
him
and
looked
for
him
in
the
*NL*
neighboring
streets
;
but
he
was
gone
.
*NL*

*NL*
Chapter
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
clear
that
I
must
repair
to
our
town
next
day
,
and
in
the
first
*NL*
flow
of
my
repentance
,
it
was
equally
clear
that
I
must
stay
at
Joe
's
.
*NL*
But
,
when
I
had
secured
my
box-place
by
to-morrow
's
coach
,
and
had
been
*NL*
down
to
Mr.
Pocket
's
and
back
,
I
was
not
by
any
means
convinced
on
the
*NL*
last
point
,
and
began
to
invent
reasons
and
make
excuses
for
putting
*NL*
up
at
the
Blue
Boar
.
I
should
be
an
inconvenience
at
Joe
's
;
I
was
not
*NL*
expected
,
and
my
bed
would
not
be
ready
;
I
should
be
too
far
from
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
's
,
and
she
was
exacting
and
might
n't
like
it
.
All
other
*NL*
swindlers
upon
earth
are
nothing
to
the
self-swindlers
,
and
with
such
*NL*
pretences
did
I
cheat
myself
.
Surely
a
curious
thing
.
That
I
should
*NL*
innocently
take
a
bad
half-crown
of
somebody
else
's
manufacture
is
*NL*
reasonable
enough
;
but
that
I
should
knowingly
reckon
the
spurious
coin
*NL*
of
my
own
make
as
good
money
!
An
obliging
stranger
,
under
pretence
of
*NL*
compactly
folding
up
my
bank-notes
for
security
's
sake
,
abstracts
the
*NL*
notes
and
gives
me
nutshells
;
but
what
is
his
sleight
of
hand
to
mine
,
*NL*
when
I
fold
up
my
own
nutshells
and
pass
them
on
myself
as
notes
!
*NL*
*NL*
Having
settled
that
I
must
go
to
the
Blue
Boar
,
my
mind
was
much
*NL*
disturbed
by
indecision
whether
or
not
to
take
the
Avenger
.
It
was
*NL*
tempting
to
think
of
that
expensive
Mercenary
publicly
airing
his
boots
*NL*
in
the
archway
of
the
Blue
Boar
's
posting-yard
;
it
was
almost
solemn
to
*NL*
imagine
him
casually
produced
in
the
tailor
's
shop
,
and
confounding
*NL*
the
disrespectful
senses
of
Trabb
's
boy
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Trabb
's
boy
*NL*
might
worm
himself
into
his
intimacy
and
tell
him
things
;
or
,
reckless
*NL*
and
desperate
wretch
as
I
knew
he
could
be
,
might
hoot
him
in
the
High
*NL*
Street
.
My
patroness
,
too
,
might
hear
of
him
,
and
not
approve
.
On
the
*NL*
whole
,
I
resolved
to
leave
the
Avenger
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
afternoon
coach
by
which
I
had
taken
my
place
,
and
,
as
winter
*NL*
had
now
come
round
,
I
should
not
arrive
at
my
destination
until
two
or
*NL*
three
hours
after
dark
.
Our
time
of
starting
from
the
Cross
Keys
was
*NL*
two
o'clock
.
I
arrived
on
the
ground
with
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare
,
*NL*
attended
by
the
Avenger
,
--
if
I
may
connect
that
expression
with
one
who
*NL*
never
attended
on
me
if
he
could
possibly
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
it
was
customary
to
carry
Convicts
down
to
the
dock-yards
*NL*
by
stage-coach
.
As
I
had
often
heard
of
them
in
the
capacity
of
outside
*NL*
passengers
,
and
had
more
than
once
seen
them
on
the
high
road
dangling
*NL*
their
ironed
legs
over
the
coach
roof
,
I
had
no
cause
to
be
surprised
*NL*
when
Herbert
,
meeting
me
in
the
yard
,
came
up
and
told
me
there
were
two
*NL*
convicts
going
down
with
me
.
But
I
had
a
reason
that
was
an
old
reason
*NL*
now
for
constitutionally
faltering
whenever
I
heard
the
word
``
convict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mind
them
,
Handel
?
''
said
Herbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
seemed
as
if
you
did
n't
like
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
pretend
that
I
do
like
them
,
and
I
suppose
you
do
n't
*NL*
particularly
.
But
I
do
n't
mind
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
There
they
are
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
coming
out
of
the
Tap
.
What
a
*NL*
degraded
and
vile
sight
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
treating
their
guard
,
I
suppose
,
for
they
had
a
gaoler
*NL*
with
them
,
and
all
three
came
out
wiping
their
mouths
on
their
hands
.
*NL*
The
two
convicts
were
handcuffed
together
,
and
had
irons
on
their
*NL*
legs
,
--
irons
of
a
pattern
that
I
knew
well
.
They
wore
the
dress
that
I
*NL*
likewise
knew
well
.
Their
keeper
had
a
brace
of
pistols
,
and
carried
*NL*
a
thick-knobbed
bludgeon
under
his
arm
;
but
he
was
on
terms
of
good
*NL*
understanding
with
them
,
and
stood
with
them
beside
him
,
looking
on
at
*NL*
the
putting-to
of
the
horses
,
rather
with
an
air
as
if
the
convicts
were
*NL*
an
interesting
Exhibition
not
formally
open
at
the
moment
,
and
he
the
*NL*
Curator
.
One
was
a
taller
and
stouter
man
than
the
other
,
and
appeared
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
course
,
according
to
the
mysterious
ways
of
the
world
,
*NL*
both
convict
and
free
,
to
have
had
allotted
to
him
the
smaller
suit
of
*NL*
clothes
.
His
arms
and
legs
were
like
great
pincushions
of
those
shapes
,
*NL*
and
his
attire
disguised
him
absurdly
;
but
I
knew
his
half-closed
eye
*NL*
at
one
glance
.
There
stood
the
man
whom
I
had
seen
on
the
settle
at
the
*NL*
Three
Jolly
Bargemen
on
a
Saturday
night
,
and
who
had
brought
me
down
*NL*
with
his
invisible
gun
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
make
sure
that
as
yet
he
knew
me
no
more
than
if
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
me
in
his
life
.
He
looked
across
at
me
,
and
his
eye
appraised
*NL*
my
watch-chain
,
and
then
he
incidentally
spat
and
said
something
to
the
*NL*
other
convict
,
and
they
laughed
and
slued
themselves
round
with
a
clink
*NL*
of
their
coupling
manacle
,
and
looked
at
something
else
.
The
great
*NL*
numbers
on
their
backs
,
as
if
they
were
street
doors
;
their
coarse
mangy
*NL*
ungainly
outer
surface
,
as
if
they
were
lower
animals
;
their
ironed
*NL*
legs
,
apologetically
garlanded
with
pocket-handkerchiefs
;
and
the
way
*NL*
in
which
all
present
looked
at
them
and
kept
from
them
;
made
them
-LRB-
as
*NL*
Herbert
had
said
-RRB-
a
most
disagreeable
and
degraded
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
the
worst
of
it
.
It
came
out
that
the
whole
of
the
back
*NL*
of
the
coach
had
been
taken
by
a
family
removing
from
London
,
and
that
*NL*
there
were
no
places
for
the
two
prisoners
but
on
the
seat
in
front
*NL*
behind
the
coachman
.
Hereupon
,
a
choleric
gentleman
,
who
had
taken
the
*NL*
fourth
place
on
that
seat
,
flew
into
a
most
violent
passion
,
and
said
*NL*
that
it
was
a
breach
of
contract
to
mix
him
up
with
such
villainous
*NL*
company
,
and
that
it
was
poisonous
,
and
pernicious
,
and
infamous
,
and
*NL*
shameful
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
else
.
At
this
time
the
coach
was
ready
*NL*
and
the
coachman
impatient
,
and
we
were
all
preparing
to
get
up
,
and
*NL*
the
prisoners
had
come
over
with
their
keeper
,
--
bringing
with
them
that
*NL*
curious
flavor
of
bread-poultice
,
baize
,
rope-yarn
,
and
hearthstone
,
*NL*
which
attends
the
convict
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
take
it
so
much
amiss
,
sir
,
''
pleaded
the
keeper
to
the
angry
*NL*
passenger
;
``
I
'll
sit
next
you
myself
.
I
'll
put
'em
on
the
outside
of
*NL*
the
row
.
They
wo
n't
interfere
with
you
,
sir
.
You
need
n't
know
they
're
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
blame
me
,
''
growled
the
convict
I
had
recognized
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
go
.
I
am
quite
ready
to
stay
behind
.
As
fur
as
I
am
concerned
*NL*
any
one
's
welcome
to
my
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
mine
,
''
said
the
other
,
gruffly
.
``
I
would
n't
have
incommoded
none
*NL*
of
you
,
if
I
'd
had
my
way
.
''
Then
they
both
laughed
,
and
began
cracking
*NL*
nuts
,
and
spitting
the
shells
about
.
--
As
I
really
think
I
should
have
*NL*
liked
to
do
myself
,
if
I
had
been
in
their
place
and
so
despised
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
it
was
voted
that
there
was
no
help
for
the
angry
gentleman
,
*NL*
and
that
he
must
either
go
in
his
chance
company
or
remain
behind
.
So
he
*NL*
got
into
his
place
,
still
making
complaints
,
and
the
keeper
got
into
the
*NL*
place
next
him
,
and
the
convicts
hauled
themselves
up
as
well
as
they
*NL*
could
,
and
the
convict
I
had
recognized
sat
behind
me
with
his
breath
on
*NL*
the
hair
of
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Handel
!
''
Herbert
called
out
as
we
started
.
I
thought
what
a
*NL*
blessed
fortune
it
was
,
that
he
had
found
another
name
for
me
than
Pip
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
express
with
what
acuteness
I
felt
the
convict
's
*NL*
breathing
,
not
only
on
the
back
of
my
head
,
but
all
along
my
spine
.
The
*NL*
sensation
was
like
being
touched
in
the
marrow
with
some
pungent
and
*NL*
searching
acid
,
it
set
my
very
teeth
on
edge
.
He
seemed
to
have
more
*NL*
breathing
business
to
do
than
another
man
,
and
to
make
more
noise
in
*NL*
doing
it
;
and
I
was
conscious
of
growing
high-shouldered
on
one
side
,
in
*NL*
my
shrinking
endeavors
to
fend
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
weather
was
miserably
raw
,
and
the
two
cursed
the
cold
.
It
made
us
*NL*
all
lethargic
before
we
had
gone
far
,
and
when
we
had
left
the
Half-way
*NL*
House
behind
,
we
habitually
dozed
and
shivered
and
were
silent
.
I
dozed
*NL*
off
,
myself
,
in
considering
the
question
whether
I
ought
to
restore
a
*NL*
couple
of
pounds
sterling
to
this
creature
before
losing
sight
of
him
,
*NL*
and
how
it
could
best
be
done
.
In
the
act
of
dipping
forward
as
if
I
*NL*
were
going
to
bathe
among
the
horses
,
I
woke
in
a
fright
and
took
the
*NL*
question
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
must
have
lost
it
longer
than
I
had
thought
,
since
,
although
*NL*
I
could
recognize
nothing
in
the
darkness
and
the
fitful
lights
and
*NL*
shadows
of
our
lamps
,
I
traced
marsh
country
in
the
cold
damp
wind
that
*NL*
blew
at
us
.
Cowering
forward
for
warmth
and
to
make
me
a
screen
against
*NL*
the
wind
,
the
convicts
were
closer
to
me
than
before
.
The
very
first
*NL*
words
I
heard
them
interchange
as
I
became
conscious
,
were
the
words
of
*NL*
my
own
thought
,
``
Two
One
Pound
notes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
he
get
'em
?
''
said
the
convict
I
had
never
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
know
?
''
returned
the
other
.
``
He
had
'em
stowed
away
*NL*
somehows
.
Giv
him
by
friends
,
I
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
said
the
other
,
with
a
bitter
curse
upon
the
cold
,
``
that
I
had
*NL*
'em
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
one
pound
notes
,
or
friends
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
one
pound
notes
.
I
'd
sell
all
the
friends
I
ever
had
for
one
,
and
*NL*
think
it
a
blessed
good
bargain
.
Well
?
So
he
says
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
says
,
''
resumed
the
convict
I
had
recognized
,
--
``
it
was
all
*NL*
said
and
done
in
half
a
minute
,
behind
a
pile
of
timber
in
the
*NL*
Dock-yard
,
--
`
You
're
a
going
to
be
discharged
?
'
Yes
,
I
was
.
Would
I
find
*NL*
out
that
boy
that
had
fed
him
and
kep
his
secret
,
and
give
him
them
two
*NL*
one
pound
notes
?
Yes
,
I
would
.
And
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
fool
you
,
''
growled
the
other
.
``
I
'd
have
spent
'em
on
a
Man
,
in
*NL*
wittles
and
drink
.
He
must
have
been
a
green
one
.
Mean
to
say
he
knowed
*NL*
nothing
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
ha
`
porth
.
Different
gangs
and
different
ships
.
He
was
tried
again
*NL*
for
prison
breaking
,
and
got
made
a
Lifer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
that
--
Honor
!
--
the
only
time
you
worked
out
,
in
this
part
of
the
*NL*
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
might
have
been
your
opinion
of
the
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
beastly
place
.
Mudbank
,
mist
,
swamp
,
and
work
;
work
,
swamp
,
*NL*
mist
,
and
mudbank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
execrated
the
place
in
very
strong
language
,
and
gradually
*NL*
growled
themselves
out
,
and
had
nothing
left
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
overhearing
this
dialogue
,
I
should
assuredly
have
got
down
and
*NL*
been
left
in
the
solitude
and
darkness
of
the
highway
,
but
for
feeling
*NL*
certain
that
the
man
had
no
suspicion
of
my
identity
.
Indeed
,
I
was
not
*NL*
only
so
changed
in
the
course
of
nature
,
but
so
differently
dressed
and
*NL*
so
differently
circumstanced
,
that
it
was
not
at
all
likely
he
could
*NL*
have
known
me
without
accidental
help
.
Still
,
the
coincidence
of
our
*NL*
being
together
on
the
coach
,
was
sufficiently
strange
to
fill
me
with
a
*NL*
dread
that
some
other
coincidence
might
at
any
moment
connect
me
,
in
his
*NL*
hearing
,
with
my
name
.
For
this
reason
,
I
resolved
to
alight
as
soon
as
*NL*
we
touched
the
town
,
and
put
myself
out
of
his
hearing
.
This
device
I
*NL*
executed
successfully
.
My
little
portmanteau
was
in
the
boot
under
my
*NL*
feet
;
I
had
but
to
turn
a
hinge
to
get
it
out
;
I
threw
it
down
before
*NL*
me
,
got
down
after
it
,
and
was
left
at
the
first
lamp
on
the
first
*NL*
stones
of
the
town
pavement
.
As
to
the
convicts
,
they
went
their
way
*NL*
with
the
coach
,
and
I
knew
at
what
point
they
would
be
spirited
off
to
*NL*
the
river
.
In
my
fancy
,
I
saw
the
boat
with
its
convict
crew
waiting
for
*NL*
them
at
the
slime-washed
stairs
,
--
again
heard
the
gruff
``
Give
way
,
you
!
''
*NL*
like
and
order
to
dogs
,
--
again
saw
the
wicked
Noah
's
Ark
lying
out
on
*NL*
the
black
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
have
said
what
I
was
afraid
of
,
for
my
fear
was
altogether
*NL*
undefined
and
vague
,
but
there
was
great
fear
upon
me
.
As
I
walked
on
to
*NL*
the
hotel
,
I
felt
that
a
dread
,
much
exceeding
the
mere
apprehension
of
*NL*
a
painful
or
disagreeable
recognition
,
made
me
tremble
.
I
am
confident
*NL*
that
it
took
no
distinctness
of
shape
,
and
that
it
was
the
revival
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
of
the
terror
of
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coffee-room
at
the
Blue
Boar
was
empty
,
and
I
had
not
only
ordered
*NL*
my
dinner
there
,
but
had
sat
down
to
it
,
before
the
waiter
knew
me
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
he
had
apologized
for
the
remissness
of
his
memory
,
he
asked
me
*NL*
if
he
should
send
Boots
for
Mr.
Pumblechook
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
,
``
certainly
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
-LRB-
it
was
he
who
had
brought
up
the
Great
Remonstrance
from
the
*NL*
Commercials
,
on
the
day
when
I
was
bound
-RRB-
appeared
surprised
,
and
*NL*
took
the
earliest
opportunity
of
putting
a
dirty
old
copy
of
a
local
*NL*
newspaper
so
directly
in
my
way
,
that
I
took
it
up
and
read
this
*NL*
paragraph
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Our
readers
will
learn
,
not
altogether
without
interest
,
in
reference
to
*NL*
the
recent
romantic
rise
in
fortune
of
a
young
artificer
in
iron
of
this
*NL*
neighborhood
-LRB-
what
a
theme
,
by
the
way
,
for
the
magic
pen
of
our
as
yet
*NL*
not
universally
acknowledged
townsman
TOOBY
,
the
poet
of
our
columns
!
-RRB-
*NL*
that
the
youth
's
earliest
patron
,
companion
,
and
friend
,
was
a
highly
*NL*
respected
individual
not
entirely
unconnected
with
the
corn
and
seed
*NL*
trade
,
and
whose
eminently
convenient
and
commodious
business
premises
*NL*
are
situate
within
a
hundred
miles
of
the
High
Street
.
It
is
not
wholly
*NL*
irrespective
of
our
personal
feelings
that
we
record
HIM
as
the
Mentor
*NL*
of
our
young
Telemachus
,
for
it
is
good
to
know
that
our
town
produced
*NL*
the
founder
of
the
latter
's
fortunes
.
Does
the
thought-contracted
brow
*NL*
of
the
local
Sage
or
the
lustrous
eye
of
local
Beauty
inquire
whose
*NL*
fortunes
?
We
believe
that
Quintin
Matsys
was
the
BLACKSMITH
of
Antwerp

*NL*
I
entertain
a
conviction
,
based
upon
large
experience
,
that
if
in
the
*NL*
days
of
my
prosperity
I
had
gone
to
the
North
Pole
,
I
should
have
met
*NL*
somebody
there
,
wandering
Esquimaux
or
civilized
man
,
who
would
have
*NL*
told
me
that
Pumblechook
was
my
earliest
patron
and
the
founder
of
my
*NL*
fortunes
.

Chapter
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
Betimes
in
the
morning
I
was
up
and
out
.
It
was
too
early
yet
to
go
to
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
's
,
so
I
loitered
into
the
country
on
Miss
Havisham
's
*NL*
side
of
town
,
--
which
was
not
Joe
's
side
;
I
could
go
there
*NL*
to-morrow
,
--
thinking
about
my
patroness
,
and
painting
brilliant
pictures
*NL*
of
her
plans
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
adopted
Estella
,
she
had
as
good
as
adopted
me
,
and
it
could
not
*NL*
fail
to
be
her
intention
to
bring
us
together
.
She
reserved
it
for
me
to
*NL*
restore
the
desolate
house
,
admit
the
sunshine
into
the
dark
rooms
,
*NL*
set
the
clocks
a-going
and
the
cold
hearths
a-blazing
,
tear
down
the
*NL*
cobwebs
,
destroy
the
vermin
,
--
in
short
,
do
all
the
shining
deeds
of
the
*NL*
young
Knight
of
romance
,
and
marry
the
Princess
.
I
had
stopped
to
*NL*
look
at
the
house
as
I
passed
;
and
its
seared
red
brick
walls
,
blocked
*NL*
windows
,
and
strong
green
ivy
clasping
even
the
stacks
of
chimneys
with
*NL*
its
twigs
and
tendons
,
as
if
with
sinewy
old
arms
,
had
made
up
a
rich
*NL*
attractive
mystery
,
of
which
I
was
the
hero
.
Estella
was
the
inspiration
*NL*
of
it
,
and
the
heart
of
it
,
of
course
.
But
,
though
she
had
taken
such
*NL*
strong
possession
of
me
,
though
my
fancy
and
my
hope
were
so
set
upon
*NL*
her
,
though
her
influence
on
my
boyish
life
and
character
had
been
*NL*
all-powerful
,
I
did
not
,
even
that
romantic
morning
,
invest
her
with
any
*NL*
attributes
save
those
she
possessed
.
I
mention
this
in
this
place
,
of
a
*NL*
fixed
purpose
,
because
it
is
the
clew
by
which
I
am
to
be
followed
into
*NL*
my
poor
labyrinth
.
According
to
my
experience
,
the
conventional
notion
*NL*
of
a
lover
can
not
be
always
true
.
The
unqualified
truth
is
,
that
when
I
*NL*
loved
Estella
with
the
love
of
a
man
,
I
loved
her
simply
because
I
found
*NL*
her
irresistible
.
Once
for
all
;
I
knew
to
my
sorrow
,
often
and
often
,
*NL*
if
not
always
,
that
I
loved
her
against
reason
,
against
promise
,
against
*NL*
peace
,
against
hope
,
against
happiness
,
against
all
discouragement
that
*NL*
could
be
.
Once
for
all
;
I
loved
her
none
the
less
because
I
knew
it
,
*NL*
and
it
had
no
more
influence
in
restraining
me
than
if
I
had
devoutly
*NL*
believed
her
to
be
human
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
so
shaped
out
my
walk
as
to
arrive
at
the
gate
at
my
old
time
.
When
*NL*
I
had
rung
at
the
bell
with
an
unsteady
hand
,
I
turned
my
back
upon
the
*NL*
gate
,
while
I
tried
to
get
my
breath
and
keep
the
beating
of
my
heart
*NL*
moderately
quiet
.
I
heard
the
side-door
open
,
and
steps
come
across
the
*NL*
courtyard
;
but
I
pretended
not
to
hear
,
even
when
the
gate
swung
on
its
*NL*
rusty
hinges
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
at
last
touched
on
the
shoulder
,
I
started
and
turned
.
I
started
*NL*
much
more
naturally
then
,
to
find
myself
confronted
by
a
man
in
a
sober
*NL*
gray
dress
.
The
last
man
I
should
have
expected
to
see
in
that
place
of
*NL*
porter
at
Miss
Havisham
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Orlick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
young
master
,
there
's
more
changes
than
yours
.
But
come
in
,
come
*NL*
in
.
It
's
opposed
to
my
orders
to
hold
the
gate
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
entered
and
he
swung
it
,
and
locked
it
,
and
took
the
key
out
.
``
Yes
!
''
*NL*
said
he
,
facing
round
,
after
doggedly
preceding
me
a
few
steps
towards
*NL*
the
house
.
``
Here
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
come
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
her
,
''
he
retorted
,
``
on
my
legs
.
I
had
my
box
brought
alongside
*NL*
me
in
a
barrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
here
for
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ai
n't
here
for
harm
,
young
master
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
so
sure
of
that
.
I
had
leisure
to
entertain
the
retort
in
my
*NL*
mind
,
while
he
slowly
lifted
his
heavy
glance
from
the
pavement
,
up
my
*NL*
legs
and
arms
,
to
my
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
left
the
forge
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
this
look
like
a
forge
?
''
replied
Orlick
,
sending
his
glance
all
*NL*
round
him
with
an
air
of
injury
.
``
Now
,
do
it
look
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
how
long
he
had
left
Gargery
's
forge
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
is
so
like
another
here
,
''
he
replied
,
``
that
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
without
casting
it
up
.
However
,
I
come
here
some
time
since
you
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
have
told
you
that
,
Orlick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
he
,
dryly
.
``
But
then
you
've
got
to
be
a
scholar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
we
had
come
to
the
house
,
where
I
found
his
room
to
be
one
*NL*
just
within
the
side-door
,
with
a
little
window
in
it
looking
on
the
*NL*
courtyard
.
In
its
small
proportions
,
it
was
not
unlike
the
kind
of
place
*NL*
usually
assigned
to
a
gate-porter
in
Paris
.
Certain
keys
were
hanging
on
*NL*
the
wall
,
to
which
he
now
added
the
gate
key
;
and
his
patchwork-covered
*NL*
bed
was
in
a
little
inner
division
or
recess
.
The
whole
had
a
slovenly
,
*NL*
confined
,
and
sleepy
look
,
like
a
cage
for
a
human
dormouse
;
while
he
,
*NL*
looming
dark
and
heavy
in
the
shadow
of
a
corner
by
the
window
,
looked
*NL*
like
the
human
dormouse
for
whom
it
was
fitted
up
,
--
as
indeed
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
this
room
before
,
''
I
remarked
;
``
but
there
used
to
be
no
*NL*
Porter
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
;
``
not
till
it
got
about
that
there
was
no
protection
on
*NL*
the
premises
,
and
it
come
to
be
considered
dangerous
,
with
convicts
and
*NL*
Tag
and
Rag
and
Bobtail
going
up
and
down
.
And
then
I
was
recommended
to
*NL*
the
place
as
a
man
who
could
give
another
man
as
good
as
he
brought
,
and
*NL*
I
took
it
.
It
's
easier
than
bellowsing
and
hammering
.
--
That
's
loaded
,
*NL*
that
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
eye
had
been
caught
by
a
gun
with
a
brass-bound
stock
over
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
and
his
eye
had
followed
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
not
desirous
of
more
conversation
,
``
shall
I
go
up
to
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burn
me
,
if
I
know
!
''
he
retorted
,
first
stretching
himself
and
then
*NL*
shaking
himself
;
``
my
orders
ends
here
,
young
master
.
I
give
this
here
*NL*
bell
a
rap
with
this
here
hammer
,
and
you
go
on
along
the
passage
till
*NL*
you
meet
somebody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
expected
,
I
believe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burn
me
twice
over
,
if
I
can
say
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
that
,
I
turned
down
the
long
passage
which
I
had
first
trodden
in
*NL*
my
thick
boots
,
and
he
made
his
bell
sound
.
At
the
end
of
the
passage
,
*NL*
while
the
bell
was
still
reverberating
,
I
found
Sarah
Pocket
,
who
*NL*
appeared
to
have
now
become
constitutionally
green
and
yellow
by
reason
*NL*
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
she
.
``
You
,
is
it
,
Mr.
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
Miss
Pocket
.
I
am
glad
to
tell
you
that
Mr.
Pocket
and
family
*NL*
are
all
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
any
wiser
?
''
said
Sarah
,
with
a
dismal
shake
of
the
head
;
``
they
*NL*
had
better
be
wiser
,
than
well
.
Ah
,
Matthew
,
Matthew
!
You
know
your
way
,
*NL*
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tolerably
,
for
I
had
gone
up
the
staircase
in
the
dark
,
many
a
time
.
I
*NL*
ascended
it
now
,
in
lighter
boots
than
of
yore
,
and
tapped
in
my
old
*NL*
way
at
the
door
of
Miss
Havisham
's
room
.
``
Pip
's
rap
,
''
I
heard
her
say
,
*NL*
immediately
;
``
come
in
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
her
chair
near
the
old
table
,
in
the
old
dress
,
with
her
two
*NL*
hands
crossed
on
her
stick
,
her
chin
resting
on
them
,
and
her
eyes
on
*NL*
the
fire
.
Sitting
near
her
,
with
the
white
shoe
,
that
had
never
been
*NL*
worn
,
in
her
hand
,
and
her
head
bent
as
she
looked
at
it
,
was
an
elegant
*NL*
lady
whom
I
had
never
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
Pip
,
''
Miss
Havisham
continued
to
mutter
,
without
looking
round
*NL*
or
up
;
``
come
in
,
Pip
,
how
do
you
do
,
Pip
?
so
you
kiss
my
hand
as
if
I
*NL*
were
a
queen
,
eh
?
--
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
at
me
suddenly
,
only
moving
her
eyes
,
and
repeated
in
a
*NL*
grimly
playful
manner
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
,
Miss
Havisham
,
''
said
I
,
rather
at
a
loss
,
``
that
you
were
so
*NL*
kind
as
to
wish
me
to
come
and
see
you
,
and
I
came
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
whom
I
had
never
seen
before
,
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
looked
*NL*
archly
at
me
,
and
then
I
saw
that
the
eyes
were
Estella
's
eyes
.
But
she
*NL*
was
so
much
changed
,
was
so
much
more
beautiful
,
so
much
more
womanly
,
*NL*
in
all
things
winning
admiration
,
had
made
such
wonderful
advance
,
*NL*
that
I
seemed
to
have
made
none
.
I
fancied
,
as
I
looked
at
her
,
that
*NL*
I
slipped
hopelessly
back
into
the
coarse
and
common
boy
again
.
O
*NL*
the
sense
of
distance
and
disparity
that
came
upon
me
,
and
the
*NL*
inaccessibility
that
came
about
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
me
her
hand
.
I
stammered
something
about
the
pleasure
I
felt
in
*NL*
seeing
her
again
,
and
about
my
having
looked
forward
to
it
,
for
a
long
,
*NL*
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
find
her
much
changed
,
Pip
?
''
asked
Miss
Havisham
,
with
her
*NL*
greedy
look
,
and
striking
her
stick
upon
a
chair
that
stood
between
*NL*
them
,
as
a
sign
to
me
to
sit
down
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
came
in
,
Miss
Havisham
,
I
thought
there
was
nothing
of
Estella
*NL*
in
the
face
or
figure
;
but
now
it
all
settles
down
so
curiously
into
the
*NL*
old
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
You
are
not
going
to
say
into
the
old
Estella
?
''
Miss
Havisham
*NL*
interrupted
.
``
She
was
proud
and
insulting
,
and
you
wanted
to
go
away
*NL*
from
her
.
Do
n't
you
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
confusedly
that
that
was
long
ago
,
and
that
I
knew
no
better
*NL*
then
,
and
the
like
.
Estella
smiled
with
perfect
composure
,
and
said
she
*NL*
had
no
doubt
of
my
having
been
quite
right
,
and
of
her
having
been
very
*NL*
disagreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
changed
?
''
Miss
Havisham
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
,
''
said
Estella
,
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Less
coarse
and
common
?
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
playing
with
Estella
's
*NL*
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Estella
laughed
,
and
looked
at
the
shoe
in
her
hand
,
and
laughed
again
,
*NL*
and
looked
at
me
,
and
put
the
shoe
down
.
She
treated
me
as
a
boy
still
,
*NL*
but
she
lured
me
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
in
the
dreamy
room
among
the
old
strange
influences
which
had
*NL*
so
wrought
upon
me
,
and
I
learnt
that
she
had
but
just
come
home
from
*NL*
France
,
and
that
she
was
going
to
London
.
Proud
and
wilful
as
of
old
,
*NL*
she
had
brought
those
qualities
into
such
subjection
to
her
beauty
that
*NL*
it
was
impossible
and
out
of
nature
--
or
I
thought
so
--
to
separate
them
*NL*
from
her
beauty
.
Truly
it
was
impossible
to
dissociate
her
presence
*NL*
from
all
those
wretched
hankerings
after
money
and
gentility
that
had
*NL*
disturbed
my
boyhood
,
--
from
all
those
ill-regulated
aspirations
that
had
*NL*
first
made
me
ashamed
of
home
and
Joe
,
--
from
all
those
visions
that
had
*NL*
raised
her
face
in
the
glowing
fire
,
struck
it
out
of
the
iron
on
the
*NL*
anvil
,
extracted
it
from
the
darkness
of
night
to
look
in
at
the
wooden
*NL*
window
of
the
forge
,
and
flit
away
.
In
a
word
,
it
was
impossible
for
me
*NL*
to
separate
her
,
in
the
past
or
in
the
present
,
from
the
innermost
life
*NL*
of
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
settled
that
I
should
stay
there
all
the
rest
of
the
day
,
and
*NL*
return
to
the
hotel
at
night
,
and
to
London
to-morrow
.
When
we
had
*NL*
conversed
for
a
while
,
Miss
Havisham
sent
us
two
out
to
walk
in
the
*NL*
neglected
garden
:
on
our
coming
in
by
and
by
,
she
said
,
I
should
wheel
*NL*
her
about
a
little
,
as
in
times
of
yore
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
Estella
and
I
went
out
into
the
garden
by
the
gate
through
which
I
*NL*
had
strayed
to
my
encounter
with
the
pale
young
gentleman
,
now
Herbert
;
*NL*
I
,
trembling
in
spirit
and
worshipping
the
very
hem
of
her
dress
;
she
,
*NL*
quite
composed
and
most
decidedly
not
worshipping
the
hem
of
mine
.
As
we
*NL*
drew
near
to
the
place
of
encounter
,
she
stopped
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
have
been
a
singular
little
creature
to
hide
and
see
that
fight
*NL*
that
day
;
but
I
did
,
and
I
enjoyed
it
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
rewarded
me
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
?
''
she
replied
,
in
an
incidental
and
forgetful
way
.
``
I
remember
I
*NL*
entertained
a
great
objection
to
your
adversary
,
because
I
took
it
ill
*NL*
that
he
should
be
brought
here
to
pester
me
with
his
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
and
I
are
great
friends
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
?
I
think
I
recollect
though
,
that
you
read
with
his
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
the
admission
with
reluctance
,
for
it
seemed
to
have
a
boyish
*NL*
look
,
and
she
already
treated
me
more
than
enough
like
a
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
your
change
of
fortune
and
prospects
,
you
have
changed
your
*NL*
companions
,
''
said
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
necessarily
,
''
she
added
,
in
a
haughty
tone
;
``
what
was
fit
company
*NL*
for
you
once
,
would
be
quite
unfit
company
for
you
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
conscience
,
I
doubt
very
much
whether
I
had
any
lingering
*NL*
intention
left
of
going
to
see
Joe
;
but
if
I
had
,
this
observation
put
*NL*
it
to
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
no
idea
of
your
impending
good
fortune
,
in
those
times
?
''
said
*NL*
Estella
,
with
a
slight
wave
of
her
hand
,
signifying
in
the
fighting
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
of
completeness
and
superiority
with
which
she
walked
at
my
*NL*
side
,
and
the
air
of
youthfulness
and
submission
with
which
I
walked
at
*NL*
hers
,
made
a
contrast
that
I
strongly
felt
.
It
would
have
rankled
in
me
*NL*
more
than
it
did
,
if
I
had
not
regarded
myself
as
eliciting
it
by
being
*NL*
so
set
apart
for
her
and
assigned
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
was
too
overgrown
and
rank
for
walking
in
with
ease
,
and
*NL*
after
we
had
made
the
round
of
it
twice
or
thrice
,
we
came
out
again
*NL*
into
the
brewery
yard
.
I
showed
her
to
a
nicety
where
I
had
seen
her
*NL*
walking
on
the
casks
,
that
first
old
day
,
and
she
said
,
with
a
cold
and
*NL*
careless
look
in
that
direction
,
``
Did
I
?
''
I
reminded
her
where
she
had
*NL*
come
out
of
the
house
and
given
me
my
meat
and
drink
,
and
she
said
,
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
remember
.
''
``
Not
remember
that
you
made
me
cry
?
''
said
I.
``
No
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
and
shook
her
head
and
looked
about
her
.
I
verily
believe
that
*NL*
her
not
remembering
and
not
minding
in
the
least
,
made
me
cry
again
,
*NL*
inwardly
,
--
and
that
is
the
sharpest
crying
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
know
,
''
said
Estella
,
condescending
to
me
as
a
brilliant
and
*NL*
beautiful
woman
might
,
``
that
I
have
no
heart
,
--
if
that
has
anything
to
*NL*
do
with
my
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
through
some
jargon
to
the
effect
that
I
took
the
liberty
of
*NL*
doubting
that
.
That
I
knew
better
.
That
there
could
be
no
such
beauty
*NL*
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
have
a
heart
to
be
stabbed
in
or
shot
in
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
''
said
*NL*
Estella
,
``
and
of
course
if
it
ceased
to
beat
I
should
cease
*NL*
to
be
.
But
you
know
what
I
mean
.
I
have
no
softness
there
,
*NL*
no
--
sympathy
--
sentiment
--
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
it
that
was
borne
in
upon
my
mind
when
she
stood
still
and
*NL*
looked
attentively
at
me
?
Anything
that
I
had
seen
in
Miss
Havisham
?
No
.
*NL*
In
some
of
her
looks
and
gestures
there
was
that
tinge
of
resemblance
*NL*
to
Miss
Havisham
which
may
often
be
noticed
to
have
been
acquired
by
*NL*
children
,
from
grown
person
with
whom
they
have
been
much
associated
and
*NL*
secluded
,
and
which
,
when
childhood
is
passed
,
will
produce
a
remarkable
*NL*
occasional
likeness
of
expression
between
faces
that
are
otherwise
quite
*NL*
different
.
And
yet
I
could
not
trace
this
to
Miss
Havisham
.
I
looked
*NL*
again
,
and
though
she
was
still
looking
at
me
,
the
suggestion
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
serious
,
''
said
Estella
,
not
so
much
with
a
frown
-LRB-
for
her
brow
was
*NL*
smooth
-RRB-
as
with
a
darkening
of
her
face
;
``
if
we
are
to
be
thrown
much
*NL*
together
,
you
had
better
believe
it
at
once
.
No
!
''
imperiously
stopping
*NL*
me
as
I
opened
my
lips
.
``
I
have
not
bestowed
my
tenderness
anywhere
.
I
*NL*
have
never
had
any
such
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
moment
we
were
in
the
brewery
,
so
long
disused
,
and
she
*NL*
pointed
to
the
high
gallery
where
I
had
seen
her
going
out
on
that
same
*NL*
first
day
,
and
told
me
she
remembered
to
have
been
up
there
,
and
to
have
*NL*
seen
me
standing
scared
below
.
As
my
eyes
followed
her
white
hand
,
again
*NL*
the
same
dim
suggestion
that
I
could
not
possibly
grasp
crossed
me
.
My
*NL*
involuntary
start
occasioned
her
to
lay
her
hand
upon
my
arm
.
Instantly
*NL*
the
ghost
passed
once
more
and
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
Estella
.
``
Are
you
scared
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
,
if
I
believed
what
you
said
just
now
,
''
I
replied
,
to
turn
*NL*
it
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
n't
?
Very
well
.
It
is
said
,
at
any
rate
.
Miss
Havisham
will
*NL*
soon
be
expecting
you
at
your
old
post
,
though
I
think
that
might
be
*NL*
laid
aside
now
,
with
other
old
belongings
.
Let
us
make
one
more
round
*NL*
of
the
garden
,
and
then
go
in
.
Come
!
You
shall
not
shed
tears
for
my
*NL*
cruelty
to-day
;
you
shall
be
my
Page
,
and
give
me
your
shoulder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
handsome
dress
had
trailed
upon
the
ground
.
She
held
it
in
one
hand
*NL*
now
,
and
with
the
other
lightly
touched
my
shoulder
as
we
walked
.
We
*NL*
walked
round
the
ruined
garden
twice
or
thrice
more
,
and
it
was
all
in
*NL*
bloom
for
me
.
If
the
green
and
yellow
growth
of
weed
in
the
chinks
of
*NL*
the
old
wall
had
been
the
most
precious
flowers
that
ever
blew
,
it
could
*NL*
not
have
been
more
cherished
in
my
remembrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
discrepancy
of
years
between
us
to
remove
her
far
from
me
;
*NL*
we
were
of
nearly
the
same
age
,
though
of
course
the
age
told
for
more
*NL*
in
her
case
than
in
mine
;
but
the
air
of
inaccessibility
which
her
*NL*
beauty
and
her
manner
gave
her
,
tormented
me
in
the
midst
of
my
delight
,
*NL*
and
at
the
height
of
the
assurance
I
felt
that
our
patroness
had
chosen
*NL*
us
for
one
another
.
Wretched
boy
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
we
went
back
into
the
house
,
and
there
I
heard
,
with
surprise
,
*NL*
that
my
guardian
had
come
down
to
see
Miss
Havisham
on
business
,
and
*NL*
would
come
back
to
dinner
.
The
old
wintry
branches
of
chandeliers
in
*NL*
the
room
where
the
mouldering
table
was
spread
had
been
lighted
while
we
*NL*
were
out
,
and
Miss
Havisham
was
in
her
chair
and
waiting
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
pushing
the
chair
itself
back
into
the
past
,
when
we
began
*NL*
the
old
slow
circuit
round
about
the
ashes
of
the
bridal
feast
.
But
,
*NL*
in
the
funereal
room
,
with
that
figure
of
the
grave
fallen
back
in
the
*NL*
chair
fixing
its
eyes
upon
her
,
Estella
looked
more
bright
and
beautiful
*NL*
than
before
,
and
I
was
under
stronger
enchantment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
so
melted
away
,
that
our
early
dinner-hour
drew
close
at
hand
,
*NL*
and
Estella
left
us
to
prepare
herself
.
We
had
stopped
near
the
centre
*NL*
of
the
long
table
,
and
Miss
Havisham
,
with
one
of
her
withered
arms
*NL*
stretched
out
of
the
chair
,
rested
that
clenched
hand
upon
the
yellow
*NL*
cloth
.
As
Estella
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
before
going
out
at
the
*NL*
door
,
Miss
Havisham
kissed
that
hand
to
her
,
with
a
ravenous
intensity
*NL*
that
was
of
its
kind
quite
dreadful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
Estella
being
gone
and
we
two
left
alone
,
she
turned
to
me
,
and
*NL*
said
in
a
whisper
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
beautiful
,
graceful
,
well-grown
?
Do
you
admire
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
must
who
sees
her
,
Miss
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
an
arm
round
my
neck
,
and
drew
my
head
close
down
to
hers
as
*NL*
she
sat
in
the
chair
.
``
Love
her
,
love
her
,
love
her
!
How
does
she
use
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
could
answer
-LRB-
if
I
could
have
answered
so
difficult
a
question
*NL*
at
all
-RRB-
she
repeated
,
``
Love
her
,
love
her
,
love
her
!
If
she
favors
*NL*
you
,
love
her
.
If
she
wounds
you
,
love
her
.
If
she
tears
your
heart
to
*NL*
pieces
,
--
and
as
it
gets
older
and
stronger
it
will
tear
deeper
,
--
love
*NL*
her
,
love
her
,
love
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
I
seen
such
passionate
eagerness
as
was
joined
to
her
*NL*
utterance
of
these
words
.
I
could
feel
the
muscles
of
the
thin
arm
round
*NL*
my
neck
swell
with
the
vehemence
that
possessed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
me
,
Pip
!
I
adopted
her
,
to
be
loved
.
I
bred
her
and
educated
her
,
*NL*
to
be
loved
.
I
developed
her
into
what
she
is
,
that
she
might
be
loved
.
*NL*
Love
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
the
word
often
enough
,
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
she
*NL*
meant
to
say
it
;
but
if
the
often
repeated
word
had
been
hate
instead
of
*NL*
love
--
despair
--
revenge
--
dire
death
--
it
could
not
have
sounded
from
her
*NL*
lips
more
like
a
curse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
said
she
,
in
the
same
hurried
passionate
whisper
,
``
what
*NL*
real
love
is
.
It
is
blind
devotion
,
unquestioning
self-humiliation
,
*NL*
utter
submission
,
trust
and
belief
against
yourself
and
against
the
*NL*
whole
world
,
giving
up
your
whole
heart
and
soul
to
the
smiter
--
as
I
*NL*
did
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
to
that
,
and
to
a
wild
cry
that
followed
that
,
I
caught
*NL*
her
round
the
waist
.
For
she
rose
up
in
the
chair
,
in
her
shroud
of
a
*NL*
dress
,
and
struck
at
the
air
as
if
she
would
as
soon
have
struck
herself
*NL*
against
the
wall
and
fallen
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
passed
in
a
few
seconds
.
As
I
drew
her
down
into
her
chair
,
I
*NL*
was
conscious
of
a
scent
that
I
knew
,
and
turning
,
saw
my
guardian
in
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
always
carried
-LRB-
I
have
not
yet
mentioned
it
,
I
think
-RRB-
a
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
of
rich
silk
and
of
imposing
proportions
,
which
was
*NL*
of
great
value
to
him
in
his
profession
.
I
have
seen
him
so
terrify
a
*NL*
client
or
a
witness
by
ceremoniously
unfolding
this
pocket-handkerchief
*NL*
as
if
he
were
immediately
going
to
blow
his
nose
,
and
then
pausing
,
*NL*
as
if
he
knew
he
should
not
have
time
to
do
it
before
such
client
*NL*
or
witness
committed
himself
,
that
the
self-committal
has
followed
*NL*
directly
,
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
.
When
I
saw
him
in
the
room
he
had
*NL*
this
expressive
pocket-handkerchief
in
both
hands
,
and
was
looking
at
*NL*
us
.
On
meeting
my
eye
,
he
said
plainly
,
by
a
momentary
and
silent
pause
*NL*
in
that
attitude
,
``
Indeed
?
Singular
!
''
and
then
put
the
handkerchief
to
*NL*
its
right
use
with
wonderful
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
had
seen
him
as
soon
as
I
,
and
was
-LRB-
like
everybody
*NL*
else
-RRB-
afraid
of
him
.
She
made
a
strong
attempt
to
compose
herself
,
and
*NL*
stammered
that
he
was
as
punctual
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
punctual
as
ever
,
''
he
repeated
,
coming
up
to
us
.
''
-LRB-
How
do
you
do
,
*NL*
Pip
?
Shall
I
give
you
a
ride
,
Miss
Havisham
?
Once
round
?
-RRB-
And
so
you
are
*NL*
here
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
when
I
had
arrived
,
and
how
Miss
Havisham
had
wished
me
to
*NL*
come
and
see
Estella
.
To
which
he
replied
,
``
Ah
!
Very
fine
young
lady
!
''
*NL*
Then
he
pushed
Miss
Havisham
in
her
chair
before
him
,
with
one
of
his
*NL*
large
hands
,
and
put
the
other
in
his
trousers-pocket
as
if
the
pocket
*NL*
were
full
of
secrets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Pip
!
How
often
have
you
seen
Miss
Estella
before
?
''
said
he
,
when
*NL*
he
came
to
a
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
often
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
How
many
times
?
Ten
thousand
times
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Certainly
not
so
many
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jaggers
,
''
interposed
Miss
Havisham
,
much
to
my
relief
,
``
leave
my
Pip
*NL*
alone
,
and
go
with
him
to
your
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
complied
,
and
we
groped
our
way
down
the
dark
stairs
together
.
While
*NL*
we
were
still
on
our
way
to
those
detached
apartments
across
the
paved
*NL*
yard
at
the
back
,
he
asked
me
how
often
I
had
seen
Miss
Havisham
eat
*NL*
and
drink
;
offering
me
a
breadth
of
choice
,
as
usual
,
between
a
hundred
*NL*
times
and
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
considered
,
and
said
,
``
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
never
will
,
Pip
,
''
he
retorted
,
with
a
frowning
smile
.
``
She
has
*NL*
never
allowed
herself
to
be
seen
doing
either
,
since
she
lived
this
*NL*
present
life
of
hers
.
She
wanders
about
in
the
night
,
and
then
lays
*NL*
hands
on
such
food
as
she
takes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
may
I
ask
you
a
question
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
I
may
decline
to
answer
it
.
Put
your
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Estella
's
name
.
Is
it
Havisham
or
--
?
''
I
had
nothing
to
add
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
what
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Havisham
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Havisham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
brought
us
to
the
dinner-table
,
where
she
and
Sarah
Pocket
awaited
*NL*
us
.
Mr.
Jaggers
presided
,
Estella
sat
opposite
to
him
,
I
faced
my
*NL*
green
and
yellow
friend
.
We
dined
very
well
,
and
were
waited
on
by
a
*NL*
maid-servant
whom
I
had
never
seen
in
all
my
comings
and
goings
,
but
*NL*
who
,
for
anything
I
know
,
had
been
in
that
mysterious
house
the
whole
*NL*
time
.
After
dinner
a
bottle
of
choice
old
port
was
placed
before
my
*NL*
guardian
-LRB-
he
was
evidently
well
acquainted
with
the
vintage
-RRB-
,
and
the
*NL*
two
ladies
left
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anything
to
equal
the
determined
reticence
of
Mr.
Jaggers
under
that
*NL*
roof
I
never
saw
elsewhere
,
even
in
him
.
He
kept
his
very
looks
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
scarcely
directed
his
eyes
to
Estella
's
face
once
during
*NL*
dinner
.
When
she
spoke
to
him
,
he
listened
,
and
in
due
course
answered
,
*NL*
but
never
looked
at
her
,
that
I
could
see
.
On
the
other
hand
,
she
often
*NL*
looked
at
him
,
with
interest
and
curiosity
,
if
not
distrust
,
but
his
*NL*
face
never
showed
the
least
consciousness
.
Throughout
dinner
he
took
*NL*
a
dry
delight
in
making
Sarah
Pocket
greener
and
yellower
,
by
often
*NL*
referring
in
conversation
with
me
to
my
expectations
;
but
here
,
*NL*
again
,
he
showed
no
consciousness
,
and
even
made
it
appear
that
he
*NL*
extorted
--
and
even
did
extort
,
though
I
do
n't
know
how
--
those
references
*NL*
out
of
my
innocent
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
he
and
I
were
left
alone
together
,
he
sat
with
an
air
upon
him
*NL*
of
general
lying
by
in
consequence
of
information
he
possessed
,
that
*NL*
really
was
too
much
for
me
.
He
cross-examined
his
very
wine
when
he
had
*NL*
nothing
else
in
hand
.
He
held
it
between
himself
and
the
candle
,
tasted
*NL*
the
port
,
rolled
it
in
his
mouth
,
swallowed
it
,
looked
at
his
*NL*
glass
again
,
smelt
the
port
,
tried
it
,
drank
it
,
filled
again
,
and
*NL*
cross-examined
the
glass
again
,
until
I
was
as
nervous
as
if
I
had
known
*NL*
the
wine
to
be
telling
him
something
to
my
disadvantage
.
Three
or
four
*NL*
times
I
feebly
thought
I
would
start
conversation
;
but
whenever
he
saw
*NL*
me
going
to
ask
him
anything
,
he
looked
at
me
with
his
glass
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
rolling
his
wine
about
in
his
mouth
,
as
if
requesting
me
to
*NL*
take
notice
that
it
was
of
no
use
,
for
he
could
n't
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
Miss
Pocket
was
conscious
that
the
sight
of
me
involved
her
*NL*
in
the
danger
of
being
goaded
to
madness
,
and
perhaps
tearing
off
her
*NL*
cap
,
--
which
was
a
very
hideous
one
,
in
the
nature
of
a
muslin
mop
,
--
and
*NL*
strewing
the
ground
with
her
hair
,
--
which
assuredly
had
never
grown
*NL*
on
her
head
.
She
did
not
appear
when
we
afterwards
went
up
to
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
's
room
,
and
we
four
played
at
whist
.
In
the
interval
,
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
,
in
a
fantastic
way
,
had
put
some
of
the
most
beautiful
jewels
*NL*
from
her
dressing-table
into
Estella
's
hair
,
and
about
her
bosom
and
*NL*
arms
;
and
I
saw
even
my
guardian
look
at
her
from
under
his
thick
*NL*
eyebrows
,
and
raise
them
a
little
,
when
her
loveliness
was
before
him
,
*NL*
with
those
rich
flushes
of
glitter
and
color
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
manner
and
extent
to
which
he
took
our
trumps
into
custody
,
and
*NL*
came
out
with
mean
little
cards
at
the
ends
of
hands
,
before
which
the
*NL*
glory
of
our
Kings
and
Queens
was
utterly
abased
,
I
say
nothing
;
nor
,
of
*NL*
the
feeling
that
I
had
,
respecting
his
looking
upon
us
personally
in
the
*NL*
light
of
three
very
obvious
and
poor
riddles
that
he
had
found
out
long
*NL*
ago
.
What
I
suffered
from
,
was
the
incompatibility
between
his
cold
*NL*
presence
and
my
feelings
towards
Estella
.
It
was
not
that
I
knew
I
could
*NL*
never
bear
to
speak
to
him
about
her
,
that
I
knew
I
could
never
bear
to
*NL*
hear
him
creak
his
boots
at
her
,
that
I
knew
I
could
never
bear
to
see
*NL*
him
wash
his
hands
of
her
;
it
was
,
that
my
admiration
should
be
within
*NL*
a
foot
or
two
of
him
,
--
it
was
,
that
my
feelings
should
be
in
the
same
*NL*
place
with
him
,
--
that
,
was
the
agonizing
circumstance
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
played
until
nine
o'clock
,
and
then
it
was
arranged
that
when
Estella
*NL*
came
to
London
I
should
be
forewarned
of
her
coming
and
should
meet
her
*NL*
at
the
coach
;
and
then
I
took
leave
of
her
,
and
touched
her
and
left
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
guardian
lay
at
the
Boar
in
the
next
room
to
mine
.
Far
into
the
*NL*
night
,
Miss
Havisham
's
words
,
``
Love
her
,
love
her
,
love
her
!
''
sounded
in
*NL*
my
ears
.
I
adapted
them
for
my
own
repetition
,
and
said
to
my
pillow
,
``
I
*NL*
love
her
,
I
love
her
,
I
love
her
!
''
hundreds
of
times
.
Then
,
a
burst
of
*NL*
gratitude
came
upon
me
,
that
she
should
be
destined
for
me
,
once
the
*NL*
blacksmith
's
boy
.
Then
I
thought
if
she
were
,
as
I
feared
,
by
no
means
*NL*
rapturously
grateful
for
that
destiny
yet
,
when
would
she
begin
to
be
*NL*
interested
in
me
?
When
should
I
awaken
the
heart
within
her
that
was
*NL*
mute
and
sleeping
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
me
!
I
thought
those
were
high
and
great
emotions
.
But
I
never
thought
*NL*
there
was
anything
low
and
small
in
my
keeping
away
from
Joe
,
because
*NL*
I
knew
she
would
be
contemptuous
of
him
.
It
was
but
a
day
gone
,
and
Joe
*NL*
had
brought
the
tears
into
my
eyes
;
they
had
soon
dried
,
God
forgive
me
!
*NL*
soon
dried
.

Chapter
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
After
well
considering
the
matter
while
I
was
dressing
at
the
Blue
Boar
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
I
resolved
to
tell
my
guardian
that
I
doubted
Orlick
's
*NL*
being
the
right
sort
of
man
to
fill
a
post
of
trust
at
Miss
Havisham
's
.
*NL*
``
Why
of
course
he
is
not
the
right
sort
of
man
,
Pip
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
*NL*
comfortably
satisfied
beforehand
on
the
general
head
,
``
because
the
man
*NL*
who
fills
the
post
of
trust
never
is
the
right
sort
of
man
.
''
It
seemed
*NL*
quite
to
put
him
into
spirits
to
find
that
this
particular
post
was
*NL*
not
exceptionally
held
by
the
right
sort
of
man
,
and
he
listened
in
a
*NL*
satisfied
manner
while
I
told
him
what
knowledge
I
had
of
Orlick
.
``
Very
*NL*
good
,
Pip
,
''
he
observed
,
when
I
had
concluded
,
``
I
'll
go
round
presently
,
*NL*
and
pay
our
friend
off
.
''
Rather
alarmed
by
this
summary
action
,
I
was
*NL*
for
a
little
delay
,
and
even
hinted
that
our
friend
himself
might
be
*NL*
difficult
to
deal
with
.
``
Oh
no
he
wo
n't
,
''
said
my
guardian
,
making
his
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief-point
,
with
perfect
confidence
;
``
I
should
like
to
*NL*
see
him
argue
the
question
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
going
back
together
to
London
by
the
midday
coach
,
and
as
I
*NL*
breakfasted
under
such
terrors
of
Pumblechook
that
I
could
scarcely
hold
*NL*
my
cup
,
this
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
saying
that
I
wanted
a
walk
,
and
*NL*
that
I
would
go
on
along
the
London
road
while
Mr.
Jaggers
was
occupied
,
*NL*
if
he
would
let
the
coachman
know
that
I
would
get
into
my
place
when
*NL*
overtaken
.
I
was
thus
enabled
to
fly
from
the
Blue
Boar
immediately
*NL*
after
breakfast
.
By
then
making
a
loop
of
about
a
couple
of
miles
into
*NL*
the
open
country
at
the
back
of
Pumblechook
's
premises
,
I
got
round
into
*NL*
the
High
Street
again
,
a
little
beyond
that
pitfall
,
and
felt
myself
in
*NL*
comparative
security
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
interesting
to
be
in
the
quiet
old
town
once
more
,
and
it
was
not
*NL*
disagreeable
to
be
here
and
there
suddenly
recognized
and
stared
after
.
*NL*
One
or
two
of
the
tradespeople
even
darted
out
of
their
shops
and
went
*NL*
a
little
way
down
the
street
before
me
,
that
they
might
turn
,
as
if
they
*NL*
had
forgotten
something
,
and
pass
me
face
to
face
,
--
on
which
occasions
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
whether
they
or
I
made
the
worse
pretence
;
they
of
not
doing
*NL*
it
,
or
I
of
not
seeing
it
.
Still
my
position
was
a
distinguished
one
,
*NL*
and
I
was
not
at
all
dissatisfied
with
it
,
until
Fate
threw
me
in
the
*NL*
way
of
that
unlimited
miscreant
,
Trabb
's
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Casting
my
eyes
along
the
street
at
a
certain
point
of
my
progress
,
I
*NL*
beheld
Trabb
's
boy
approaching
,
lashing
himself
with
an
empty
blue
bag
.
*NL*
Deeming
that
a
serene
and
unconscious
contemplation
of
him
would
best
*NL*
beseem
me
,
and
would
be
most
likely
to
quell
his
evil
mind
,
I
advanced
*NL*
with
that
expression
of
countenance
,
and
was
rather
congratulating
*NL*
myself
on
my
success
,
when
suddenly
the
knees
of
Trabb
's
boy
smote
*NL*
together
,
his
hair
uprose
,
his
cap
fell
off
,
he
trembled
violently
in
*NL*
every
limb
,
staggered
out
into
the
road
,
and
crying
to
the
populace
,
*NL*
``
Hold
me
!
I
'm
so
frightened
!
''
feigned
to
be
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
and
*NL*
contrition
,
occasioned
by
the
dignity
of
my
appearance
.
As
I
passed
him
,
*NL*
his
teeth
loudly
chattered
in
his
head
,
and
with
every
mark
of
extreme
*NL*
humiliation
,
he
prostrated
himself
in
the
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
hard
thing
to
bear
,
but
this
was
nothing
.
I
had
not
advanced
*NL*
another
two
hundred
yards
when
,
to
my
inexpressible
terror
,
amazement
,
*NL*
and
indignation
,
I
again
beheld
Trabb
's
boy
approaching
.
He
was
coming
*NL*
round
a
narrow
corner
.
His
blue
bag
was
slung
over
his
shoulder
,
honest
*NL*
industry
beamed
in
his
eyes
,
a
determination
to
proceed
to
Trabb
's
with
*NL*
cheerful
briskness
was
indicated
in
his
gait
.
With
a
shock
he
became
*NL*
aware
of
me
,
and
was
severely
visited
as
before
;
but
this
time
his
*NL*
motion
was
rotatory
,
and
he
staggered
round
and
round
me
with
knees
*NL*
more
afflicted
,
and
with
uplifted
hands
as
if
beseeching
for
mercy
.
His
*NL*
sufferings
were
hailed
with
the
greatest
joy
by
a
knot
of
spectators
,
*NL*
and
I
felt
utterly
confounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
got
as
much
further
down
the
street
as
the
post-office
,
when
I
*NL*
again
beheld
Trabb
's
boy
shooting
round
by
a
back
way
.
This
time
,
he
was
*NL*
entirely
changed
.
He
wore
the
blue
bag
in
the
manner
of
my
great-coat
,
*NL*
and
was
strutting
along
the
pavement
towards
me
on
the
opposite
side
of
*NL*
the
street
,
attended
by
a
company
of
delighted
young
friends
to
whom
he
*NL*
from
time
to
time
exclaimed
,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
,
``
Do
n't
know
yah
!
''
*NL*
Words
can
not
state
the
amount
of
aggravation
and
injury
wreaked
upon
*NL*
me
by
Trabb
's
boy
,
when
passing
abreast
of
me
,
he
pulled
up
his
*NL*
shirt-collar
,
twined
his
side-hair
,
stuck
an
arm
akimbo
,
and
smirked
*NL*
extravagantly
by
,
wriggling
his
elbows
and
body
,
and
drawling
to
his
*NL*
attendants
,
``
Do
n't
know
yah
,
do
n't
know
yah
,
`
pon
my
soul
do
n't
know
*NL*
yah
!
''
The
disgrace
attendant
on
his
immediately
afterwards
taking
*NL*
to
crowing
and
pursuing
me
across
the
bridge
with
crows
,
as
from
an
*NL*
exceedingly
dejected
fowl
who
had
known
me
when
I
was
a
blacksmith
,
*NL*
culminated
the
disgrace
with
which
I
left
the
town
,
and
was
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
ejected
by
it
into
the
open
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
unless
I
had
taken
the
life
of
Trabb
's
boy
on
that
occasion
,
I
*NL*
really
do
not
even
now
see
what
I
could
have
done
save
endure
.
To
*NL*
have
struggled
with
him
in
the
street
,
or
to
have
exacted
any
lower
*NL*
recompense
from
him
than
his
heart
's
best
blood
,
would
have
been
*NL*
futile
and
degrading
.
Moreover
,
he
was
a
boy
whom
no
man
could
hurt
;
an
*NL*
invulnerable
and
dodging
serpent
who
,
when
chased
into
a
corner
,
flew
*NL*
out
again
between
his
captor
's
legs
,
scornfully
yelping
.
I
wrote
,
*NL*
however
,
to
Mr.
Trabb
by
next
day
's
post
,
to
say
that
Mr.
Pip
must
*NL*
decline
to
deal
further
with
one
who
could
so
far
forget
what
he
owed
to
*NL*
the
best
interests
of
society
,
as
to
employ
a
boy
who
excited
Loathing
*NL*
in
every
respectable
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
,
with
Mr.
Jaggers
inside
,
came
up
in
due
time
,
and
I
took
my
*NL*
box-seat
again
,
and
arrived
in
London
safe
,
--
but
not
sound
,
for
my
heart
*NL*
was
gone
.
As
soon
as
I
arrived
,
I
sent
a
penitential
codfish
and
barrel
*NL*
of
oysters
to
Joe
-LRB-
as
reparation
for
not
having
gone
myself
-RRB-
,
and
then
*NL*
went
on
to
Barnard
's
Inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
Herbert
dining
on
cold
meat
,
and
delighted
to
welcome
me
back
.
*NL*
Having
despatched
The
Avenger
to
the
coffee-house
for
an
addition
to
the
*NL*
dinner
,
I
felt
that
I
must
open
my
breast
that
very
evening
to
my
friend
*NL*
and
chum
.
As
confidence
was
out
of
the
question
with
The
Avenger
in
the
*NL*
hall
,
which
could
merely
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
an
antechamber
to
*NL*
the
keyhole
,
I
sent
him
to
the
Play
.
A
better
proof
of
the
severity
*NL*
of
my
bondage
to
that
taskmaster
could
scarcely
be
afforded
,
than
*NL*
the
degrading
shifts
to
which
I
was
constantly
driven
to
find
him
*NL*
employment
.
So
mean
is
extremity
,
that
I
sometimes
sent
him
to
Hyde
Park
*NL*
corner
to
see
what
o'clock
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
done
and
we
sitting
with
our
feet
upon
the
fender
,
I
said
to
*NL*
Herbert
,
``
My
dear
Herbert
,
I
have
something
very
particular
to
tell
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Handel
,
''
he
returned
,
``
I
shall
esteem
and
respect
your
*NL*
confidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
concerns
myself
,
Herbert
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
one
other
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
crossed
his
feet
,
looked
at
the
fire
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
*NL*
and
having
looked
at
it
in
vain
for
some
time
,
looked
at
me
because
I
*NL*
did
n't
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Herbert
,
''
said
I
,
laying
my
hand
upon
his
knee
,
``
I
love
--
I
*NL*
adore
--
Estella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
being
transfixed
,
Herbert
replied
in
an
easy
matter-of-course
*NL*
way
,
``
Exactly
.
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Herbert
?
Is
that
all
you
say
?
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
,
I
mean
?
''
said
Herbert
.
``
Of
course
I
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
it
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
I
know
it
,
Handel
?
Why
,
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Told
me
!
You
have
never
told
me
when
you
have
got
your
hair
cut
,
but
I
*NL*
have
had
senses
to
perceive
it
.
You
have
always
adored
her
,
ever
since
*NL*
I
have
known
you
.
You
brought
your
adoration
and
your
portmanteau
here
*NL*
together
.
Told
me
!
Why
,
you
have
always
told
me
all
day
long
.
When
you
*NL*
told
me
your
own
story
,
you
told
me
plainly
that
you
began
adoring
her
*NL*
the
first
time
you
saw
her
,
when
you
were
very
young
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
''
said
I
,
to
whom
this
was
a
new
and
not
unwelcome
*NL*
light
,
``
I
have
never
left
off
adoring
her
.
And
she
has
come
back
,
a
most
*NL*
beautiful
and
most
elegant
creature
.
And
I
saw
her
yesterday
.
And
if
I
*NL*
adored
her
before
,
I
now
doubly
adore
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucky
for
you
then
,
Handel
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
that
you
are
picked
out
for
*NL*
her
and
allotted
to
her
.
Without
encroaching
on
forbidden
ground
,
we
*NL*
may
venture
to
say
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
between
ourselves
of
*NL*
that
fact
.
Have
you
any
idea
yet
,
of
Estella
's
views
on
the
adoration
*NL*
question
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
gloomily
.
``
Oh
!
She
is
thousands
of
miles
away
,
from
me
,
''
*NL*
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patience
,
my
dear
Handel
:
time
enough

time
enough

But
you
have
*NL*
something
more
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ashamed
to
say
it
,
''
I
returned
,
``
and
yet
it
's
no
worse
to
say
it
*NL*
than
to
think
it

You
call
me
a
lucky
fellow
.
Of
course
,
I
am

I
was
a
*NL*
blacksmith
's
boy
but
yesterday
;
I
am

what
shall
I
say
I
am

to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
a
good
fellow
,
if
you
want
a
phrase

''
returned
Herbert
,
smiling
,
*NL*
and
clapping
his
hand
on
the
back
of
mine
--
``
a
good
fellow
,
with
*NL*
impetuosity
and
hesitation
,
boldness
and
diffidence
,
action
and
*NL*
dreaming
,
curiously
mixed
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stopped
for
a
moment
to
consider
whether
there
really
was
this
mixture
*NL*
in
my
character
.
On
the
whole
,
I
by
no
means
recognized
the
analysis
,
*NL*
but
thought
it
not
worth
disputing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
ask
what
I
am
to
call
myself
to-day
,
Herbert
,
''
I
went
on
,
``
I
*NL*
suggest
what
I
have
in
my
thoughts
.
You
say
I
am
lucky
.
I
know
I
have
*NL*
done
nothing
to
raise
myself
in
life
,
and
that
Fortune
alone
has
raised
*NL*
me
;
that
is
being
very
lucky
.
And
yet
,
when
I
think
of
Estella
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
And
when
do
n't
you
,
you
know
?
''
Herbert
threw
in
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
*NL*
fire
;
which
I
thought
kind
and
sympathetic
of
him
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Then
,
my
dear
Herbert
,
I
can
not
tell
you
how
dependent
and
uncertain
*NL*
I
feel
,
and
how
exposed
to
hundreds
of
chances
.
Avoiding
forbidden
*NL*
ground
,
as
you
did
just
now
,
I
may
still
say
that
on
the
constancy
of
*NL*
one
person
-LRB-
naming
no
person
-RRB-
all
my
expectations
depend
.
And
at
the
*NL*
best
,
how
indefinite
and
unsatisfactory
,
only
to
know
so
vaguely
what
*NL*
they
are
!
''
In
saying
this
,
I
relieved
my
mind
of
what
had
always
been
*NL*
there
,
more
or
less
,
though
no
doubt
most
since
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Handel
,
''
Herbert
replied
,
in
his
gay
,
hopeful
way
,
``
it
seems
to
me
*NL*
that
in
the
despondency
of
the
tender
passion
,
we
are
looking
into
our
*NL*
gift-horse
's
mouth
with
a
magnifying-glass
.
Likewise
,
it
seems
to
me
*NL*
that
,
concentrating
our
attention
on
the
examination
,
we
altogether
*NL*
overlook
one
of
the
best
points
of
the
animal
.
Did
n't
you
tell
me
that
*NL*
your
guardian
,
Mr.
Jaggers
,
told
you
in
the
beginning
,
that
you
were
*NL*
not
endowed
with
expectations
only
?
And
even
if
he
had
not
told
you
*NL*
so
,
--
though
that
is
a
very
large
If
,
I
grant
,
--
could
you
believe
that
of
*NL*
all
men
in
London
,
Mr.
Jaggers
is
the
man
to
hold
his
present
relations
*NL*
towards
you
unless
he
were
sure
of
his
ground
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
could
not
deny
that
this
was
a
strong
point
.
I
said
it
-LRB-
people
*NL*
often
do
so
,
in
such
cases
-RRB-
like
a
rather
reluctant
concession
to
truth
*NL*
and
justice
;
--
as
if
I
wanted
to
deny
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
was
a
strong
point
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
and
I
should
*NL*
think
you
would
be
puzzled
to
imagine
a
stronger

as
to
the
rest

you
*NL*
must
bide
your
guardian
's
time
,
and
he
must
bide
his
client
's
time
.
*NL*
You
'll
be
one-and-twenty
before
you
know
where
you
are
,
and
then
perhaps
*NL*
you
'll
get
some
further
enlightenment
.
At
all
events
,
you
'll
be
nearer
*NL*
getting
it
,
for
it
must
come
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
hopeful
disposition
you
have

said
I
,
gratefully
admiring
his
*NL*
cheery
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
have

''
said
Herbert
,
``
for
I
have
not
much

I
must
*NL*
acknowledge

by

the
good

what
I
have
just
said
is
*NL*
not
my
own

my
father

The
only
remark
I
ever
heard
him
make
on

your
story

was
the
final
one

``

--
though
he
spoke
in
this
light
tone

he
was
*NL*
very
much
in

,
--
``
I
have
been

right
in

Never

*NL*
``
Never

``
Now

Not

can
you
not

I
told
you
I
should
be
disagreeable

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
my
head
aside
,
for
,
with
a
rush
and
a
sweep
,
like
the
old
marsh
*NL*
winds
coming
up
from
the
sea
,
a
feeling
like
that
which
had
subdued
*NL*
me
on
the
morning
when
I
left
the
forge
,
when
the
mists
were
solemnly
*NL*
rising
,
and
when
I
laid
my
hand
upon
the
village
finger-post
,
smote
upon
*NL*
my
heart
again

There
was
silence
between
us
for
a
little
while

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Herbert
went
on

as
if
we
had
been
talking

*NL*
instead
of
silent
,
``
its
having
been
so
strongly
rooted
in
the
breast

a

nature

renders
it
very
*NL*
serious

Think
of
her
bringing-up
,
and
think
of
Miss
Havisham
.
Think
of
*NL*
what
she
is
herself
-LRB-
now
I
am
repulsive

you
abominate

This
may

lead

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
I
,
with
my
head
still
turned
away
,
``

up

asleep

stirring
the
fire
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
So
he
went
round
the
room
and
shook
the
curtains
out
,
put
the
chairs
*NL*
in
their
places
,
tidied
the
books

so
forth
that
were
lying
about

*NL*
looked
into
the
hall

peeped
into
the
letter-box

shut
the
door

and
*NL*
came
back
to
his
chair
by
the
fire

where
he
sat
down
,
nursing
his
left
*NL*
leg
in
both
arms

*NL*
*NL*
``

my
*NL*
father
's
son
.
I
am
afraid
it
is
scarcely
necessary
for
my
father
's
son
*NL*
to
remark
that
my
father
's
establishment
is
not
particularly
brilliant
*NL*
in
its
housekeeping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
always
plenty
,
Herbert
,
''
said
I
,
to
say
something
encouraging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
!
and
so
the
dustman
says
,
I
believe
,
with
the
strongest
approval
,
*NL*
and
so
does
the
marine-store
shop
in
the
back
street
.
Gravely
,
Handel
,
*NL*
for
the
subject
is
grave
enough
,
you
know
how
it
is
as
well
as
I
do
.
I
*NL*
suppose
there
was
a
time
once
when
my
father
had
not
given
matters
up
;
*NL*
but
if
ever
there
was
,
the
time
is
gone
.
May
I
ask
you
if
you
have
ever
*NL*
had
an
opportunity
of
remarking
,
down
in
your
part
of
the
country
,
*NL*
that
the
children
of
not
exactly
suitable
marriages
are
always
most
*NL*
particularly
anxious
to
be
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
such
a
singular
question
,
that
I
asked
him
in
return
,
``
Is
it
*NL*
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
that
's
what
I
want
to
know
.
Because
it
*NL*
is
decidedly
the
case
with
us
.
My
poor
sister
Charlotte
,
who
was
next
me
*NL*
and
died
before
she
was
fourteen
,
was
a
striking
example
.
Little
Jane
*NL*
is
the
same
.
In
her
desire
to
be
matrimonially
established
,
you
*NL*
might
suppose
her
to
have
passed
her
short
existence
in
the
perpetual
*NL*
contemplation
of
domestic
bliss
.
Little
Alick
in
a
frock
has
already
*NL*
made
arrangements
for
his
union
with
a
suitable
young
person
at
Kew
.
And
*NL*
indeed
,
I
think
we
are
all
engaged
,
except
the
baby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
said
Herbert
;
``
but
it
's
a
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
assured
him
of
my
keeping
the
secret
,
and
begged
to
be
favored
with
*NL*
further
particulars
.
He
had
spoken
so
sensibly
and
feelingly
of
my
*NL*
weakness
that
I
wanted
to
know
something
about
his
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
the
name
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
of
Clara
,
''
said
Herbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Live
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perhaps
I
ought
to
mention
,
''
said
Herbert
,
who
had
become
*NL*
curiously
crestfallen
and
meek
,
since
we
entered
on
the
interesting
*NL*
theme
,
``
that
she
is
rather
below
my
mother
's
nonsensical
family
notions
.
*NL*
Her
father
had
to
do
with
the
victualling
of
passenger-ships
.
I
think
he
*NL*
was
a
species
of
purser
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
now
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
invalid
now
,
''
replied
Herbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Living
on
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
first
floor
,
''
said
Herbert
.
Which
was
not
at
all
what
I
meant
,
*NL*
for
I
had
intended
my
question
to
apply
to
his
means
.
``
I
have
never
seen
*NL*
him
,
for
he
has
always
kept
his
room
overhead
,
since
I
have
known
Clara
.
*NL*
But
I
have
heard
him
constantly
.
He
makes
tremendous
rows
,
--
roars
,
and
*NL*
pegs
at
the
floor
with
some
frightful
instrument
.
''
In
looking
at
me
and
*NL*
then
laughing
heartily
,
Herbert
for
the
time
recovered
his
usual
lively
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
expect
to
see
him
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
I
constantly
expect
to
see
him
,
''
returned
Herbert
,
``
because
*NL*
I
never
hear
him
,
without
expecting
him
to
come
tumbling
through
the
*NL*
ceiling
.
But
I
do
n't
know
how
long
the
rafters
may
hold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
once
more
laughed
heartily
,
he
became
meek
again
,
and
told
*NL*
me
that
the
moment
he
began
to
realize
Capital
,
it
was
his
intention
*NL*
to
marry
this
young
lady
.
He
added
as
a
self-evident
proposition
,
*NL*
engendering
low
spirits
,
``
But
you
ca
n't
marry
,
you
know
,
while
you
're
*NL*
looking
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
contemplated
the
fire
,
and
as
I
thought
what
a
difficult
vision
to
*NL*
realize
this
same
Capital
sometimes
was
,
I
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
.
*NL*
A
folded
piece
of
paper
in
one
of
them
attracting
my
attention
,
I
opened
*NL*
it
and
found
it
to
be
the
play-bill
I
had
received
from
Joe
,
relative
*NL*
to
the
celebrated
provincial
amateur
of
Roscian
renown
.
``
And
bless
my
*NL*
heart
,
''
I
involuntarily
added
aloud
,
``
it
's
to-night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
changed
the
subject
in
an
instant
,
and
made
us
hurriedly
resolve
*NL*
to
go
to
the
play
.
So
,
when
I
had
pledged
myself
to
comfort
and
abet
*NL*
Herbert
in
the
affair
of
his
heart
by
all
practicable
and
impracticable
*NL*
means
,
and
when
Herbert
had
told
me
that
his
affianced
already
knew
me
*NL*
by
reputation
and
that
I
should
be
presented
to
her
,
and
when
we
had
*NL*
warmly
shaken
hands
upon
our
mutual
confidence
,
we
blew
out
our
candles
,
*NL*
made
up
our
fire
,
locked
our
door
,
and
issued
forth
in
quest
of
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
and
Denmark
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
arrival
in
Denmark
,
we
found
the
king
and
queen
of
that
country
*NL*
elevated
in
two
arm-chairs
on
a
kitchen-table
,
holding
a
Court
.
The
*NL*
whole
of
the
Danish
nobility
were
in
attendance
;
consisting
of
a
noble
*NL*
boy
in
the
wash-leather
boots
of
a
gigantic
ancestor
,
a
venerable
Peer
*NL*
with
a
dirty
face
who
seemed
to
have
risen
from
the
people
late
in
life
,
*NL*
and
the
Danish
chivalry
with
a
comb
in
its
hair
and
a
pair
of
white
*NL*
silk
legs
,
and
presenting
on
the
whole
a
feminine
appearance
.
My
gifted
*NL*
townsman
stood
gloomily
apart
,
with
folded
arms
,
and
I
could
have
wished
*NL*
that
his
curls
and
forehead
had
been
more
probable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
curious
little
circumstances
transpired
as
the
action
proceeded
.
*NL*
The
late
king
of
the
country
not
only
appeared
to
have
been
troubled
*NL*
with
a
cough
at
the
time
of
his
decease
,
but
to
have
taken
it
with
him
*NL*
to
the
tomb
,
and
to
have
brought
it
back
.
The
royal
phantom
also
carried
*NL*
a
ghostly
manuscript
round
its
truncheon
,
to
which
it
had
the
appearance
*NL*
of
occasionally
referring
,
and
that
too
,
with
an
air
of
anxiety
and
a
*NL*
tendency
to
lose
the
place
of
reference
which
were
suggestive
of
a
state
*NL*
of
mortality
.
It
was
this
,
I
conceive
,
which
led
to
the
Shade
's
being
*NL*
advised
by
the
gallery
to
``
turn
over
!
''
--
a
recommendation
which
it
took
*NL*
extremely
ill
.
It
was
likewise
to
be
noted
of
this
majestic
spirit
,
that
*NL*
whereas
it
always
appeared
with
an
air
of
having
been
out
a
long
time
*NL*
and
walked
an
immense
distance
,
it
perceptibly
came
from
a
closely
*NL*
contiguous
wall
.
This
occasioned
its
terrors
to
be
received
derisively
.
*NL*
The
Queen
of
Denmark
,
a
very
buxom
lady
,
though
no
doubt
historically
*NL*
brazen
,
was
considered
by
the
public
to
have
too
much
brass
about
her
;
*NL*
her
chin
being
attached
to
her
diadem
by
a
broad
band
of
that
metal
-LRB-
as
*NL*
if
she
had
a
gorgeous
toothache
-RRB-
,
her
waist
being
encircled
by
another
,
*NL*
and
each
of
her
arms
by
another
,
so
that
she
was
openly
mentioned
*NL*
as
``
the
kettle-drum
.
''
The
noble
boy
in
the
ancestral
boots
was
*NL*
inconsistent
,
representing
himself
,
as
it
were
in
one
breath
,
as
an
able
*NL*
seaman
,
a
strolling
actor
,
a
grave-digger
,
a
clergyman
,
and
a
person
*NL*
of
the
utmost
importance
at
a
Court
fencing-match
,
on
the
authority
*NL*
of
whose
practised
eye
and
nice
discrimination
the
finest
strokes
were
*NL*
judged
.
This
gradually
led
to
a
want
of
toleration
for
him
,
and
even
--
on
*NL*
his
being
detected
in
holy
orders
,
and
declining
to
perform
the
funeral
*NL*
service
--
to
the
general
indignation
taking
the
form
of
nuts
.
Lastly
,
*NL*
Ophelia
was
a
prey
to
such
slow
musical
madness
,
that
when
,
in
course
of
*NL*
time
,
she
had
taken
off
her
white
muslin
scarf
,
folded
it
up
,
and
buried
*NL*
it
,
a
sulky
man
who
had
been
long
cooling
his
impatient
nose
against
an
*NL*
iron
bar
in
the
front
row
of
the
gallery
,
growled
,
``
Now
the
baby
's
put
*NL*
to
bed
let
's
have
supper
!
''
Which
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
,
was
out
of
*NL*
keeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
my
unfortunate
townsman
all
these
incidents
accumulated
with
*NL*
playful
effect
.
Whenever
that
undecided
Prince
had
to
ask
a
question
or
*NL*
state
a
doubt
,
the
public
helped
him
out
with
it
.
As
for
example
;
on
the
*NL*
question
whether
't
was
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
,
some
roared
yes
,
*NL*
and
some
no
,
and
some
inclining
to
both
opinions
said
``
Toss
up
for
*NL*
it
;
''
and
quite
a
Debating
Society
arose
.
When
he
asked
what
should
such
*NL*
fellows
as
he
do
crawling
between
earth
and
heaven
,
he
was
encouraged
*NL*
with
loud
cries
of
``
Hear
,
hear
!
''
When
he
appeared
with
his
stocking
*NL*
disordered
-LRB-
its
disorder
expressed
,
according
to
usage
,
by
one
very
neat
*NL*
fold
in
the
top
,
which
I
suppose
to
be
always
got
up
with
a
flat
iron
-RRB-
,
*NL*
a
conversation
took
place
in
the
gallery
respecting
the
paleness
of
his
*NL*
leg
,
and
whether
it
was
occasioned
by
the
turn
the
ghost
had
given
him
.
*NL*
On
his
taking
the
recorders
,
--
very
like
a
little
black
flute
that
had
*NL*
just
been
played
in
the
orchestra
and
handed
out
at
the
door
,
--
he
was
*NL*
called
upon
unanimously
for
Rule
Britannia
.
When
he
recommended
the
*NL*
player
not
to
saw
the
air
thus
,
the
sulky
man
said
,
``
And
do
n't
you
do
*NL*
it
,
neither
;
you
're
a
deal
worse
than
him
!
''
And
I
grieve
to
add
that
*NL*
peals
of
laughter
greeted
Mr.
Wopsle
on
every
one
of
these
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
greatest
trials
were
in
the
churchyard
,
which
had
the
appearance
*NL*
of
a
primeval
forest
,
with
a
kind
of
small
ecclesiastical
wash-house
*NL*
on
one
side
,
and
a
turnpike
gate
on
the
other
.
Mr.
Wopsle
in
a
*NL*
comprehensive
black
cloak
,
being
descried
entering
at
the
turnpike
,
*NL*
the
gravedigger
was
admonished
in
a
friendly
way
,
``
Look
out
!
Here
's
the
*NL*
undertaker
a
coming
,
to
see
how
you
're
a
getting
on
with
your
work
!
''
*NL*
I
believe
it
is
well
known
in
a
constitutional
country
that
Mr.
Wopsle
*NL*
could
not
possibly
have
returned
the
skull
,
after
moralizing
over
it
,
*NL*
without
dusting
his
fingers
on
a
white
napkin
taken
from
his
breast
;
*NL*
but
even
that
innocent
and
indispensable
action
did
not
pass
without
the
*NL*
comment
,
``
Wai-ter
!
''
The
arrival
of
the
body
for
interment
-LRB-
in
an
empty
*NL*
black
box
with
the
lid
tumbling
open
-RRB-
,
was
the
signal
for
a
general
*NL*
joy
,
which
was
much
enhanced
by
the
discovery
,
among
the
bearers
,
of
*NL*
an
individual
obnoxious
to
identification
.
The
joy
attended
Mr.
Wopsle
*NL*
through
his
struggle
with
Laertes
on
the
brink
of
the
orchestra
and
*NL*
the
grave
,
and
slackened
no
more
until
he
had
tumbled
the
king
off
the
*NL*
kitchen-table
,
and
had
died
by
inches
from
the
ankles
upward
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
made
some
pale
efforts
in
the
beginning
to
applaud
Mr.
Wopsle
;
*NL*
but
they
were
too
hopeless
to
be
persisted
in
.
Therefore
we
had
sat
,
*NL*
feeling
keenly
for
him
,
but
laughing
,
nevertheless
,
from
ear
to
ear
.
I
*NL*
laughed
in
spite
of
myself
all
the
time
,
the
whole
thing
was
so
droll
;
*NL*
and
yet
I
had
a
latent
impression
that
there
was
something
decidedly
*NL*
fine
in
Mr.
Wopsle
's
elocution
,
--
not
for
old
associations
'
sake
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid
,
but
because
it
was
very
slow
,
very
dreary
,
very
uphill
and
*NL*
downhill
,
and
very
unlike
any
way
in
which
any
man
in
any
natural
*NL*
circumstances
of
life
or
death
ever
expressed
himself
about
anything
.
*NL*
When
the
tragedy
was
over
,
and
he
had
been
called
for
and
hooted
,
I
said
*NL*
to
Herbert
,
``
Let
us
go
at
once
,
or
perhaps
we
shall
meet
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
all
the
haste
we
could
downstairs
,
but
we
were
not
quick
enough
*NL*
either
.
Standing
at
the
door
was
a
Jewish
man
with
an
unnatural
heavy
*NL*
smear
of
eyebrow
,
who
caught
my
eyes
as
we
advanced
,
and
said
,
when
we
*NL*
came
up
with
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Pip
and
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Identity
of
Mr.
Pip
and
friend
confessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Waldengarver
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
would
be
glad
to
have
the
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waldengarver
?
''
I
repeated
--
when
Herbert
murmured
in
my
ear
,
``
Probably
*NL*
Wopsle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
I.
``
Yes
.
Shall
we
follow
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
few
steps
,
please
.
''
When
we
were
in
a
side
alley
,
he
turned
and
*NL*
asked
,
``
How
did
you
think
he
looked
?
--
I
dressed
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
he
had
looked
like
,
except
a
funeral
;
with
the
*NL*
addition
of
a
large
Danish
sun
or
star
hanging
round
his
neck
by
a
*NL*
blue
ribbon
,
that
had
given
him
the
appearance
of
being
insured
in
some
*NL*
extraordinary
Fire
Office
.
But
I
said
he
had
looked
very
nice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
he
come
to
the
grave
,
''
said
our
conductor
,
``
he
showed
his
cloak
*NL*
beautiful
.
But
,
judging
from
the
wing
,
it
looked
to
me
that
when
he
*NL*
see
the
ghost
in
the
queen
's
apartment
,
he
might
have
made
more
of
his
*NL*
stockings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
modestly
assented
,
and
we
all
fell
through
a
little
dirty
swing
door
,
*NL*
into
a
sort
of
hot
packing-case
immediately
behind
it
.
Here
Mr.
Wopsle
*NL*
was
divesting
himself
of
his
Danish
garments
,
and
here
there
was
just
*NL*
room
for
us
to
look
at
him
over
one
another
's
shoulders
,
by
keeping
the
*NL*
packing-case
door
,
or
lid
,
wide
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Mr.
Wopsle
,
``
I
am
proud
to
see
you
.
I
hope
,
Mr.
Pip
,
*NL*
you
will
excuse
my
sending
round
.
I
had
the
happiness
to
know
you
in
*NL*
former
times
,
and
the
Drama
has
ever
had
a
claim
which
has
ever
been
*NL*
acknowledged
,
on
the
noble
and
the
affluent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Mr.
Waldengarver
,
in
a
frightful
perspiration
,
was
trying
to
*NL*
get
himself
out
of
his
princely
sables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Skin
the
stockings
off
Mr.
Waldengarver
,
''
said
the
owner
of
that
*NL*
property
,
``
or
you
'll
bust
'em
.
Bust
'em
,
and
you
'll
bust
five-and-thirty
*NL*
shillings
.
Shakspeare
never
was
complimented
with
a
finer
pair
.
Keep
*NL*
quiet
in
your
chair
now
,
and
leave
'em
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
he
went
upon
his
knees
,
and
began
to
flay
his
victim
;
who
,
on
*NL*
the
first
stocking
coming
off
,
would
certainly
have
fallen
over
backward
*NL*
with
his
chair
,
but
for
there
being
no
room
to
fall
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
afraid
until
then
to
say
a
word
about
the
play
.
But
then
,
Mr.
*NL*
Waldengarver
looked
up
at
us
complacently
,
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
how
did
it
seem
to
you
,
to
go
,
in
front
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
said
from
behind
-LRB-
at
the
same
time
poking
me
-RRB-
,
``
Capitally
.
''
So
I
*NL*
said
``
Capitally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
like
my
reading
of
the
character
,
gentlemen
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Waldengarver
,
almost
,
if
not
quite
,
with
patronage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
said
from
behind
-LRB-
again
poking
me
-RRB-
,
``
Massive
and
concrete
.
''
So
I
*NL*
said
boldly
,
as
if
I
had
originated
it
,
and
must
beg
to
insist
upon
it
,
*NL*
``
Massive
and
concrete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
have
your
approbation
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Mr.
Waldengarver
,
*NL*
with
an
air
of
dignity
,
in
spite
of
his
being
ground
against
the
wall
at
*NL*
the
time
,
and
holding
on
by
the
seat
of
the
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
tell
you
one
thing
,
Mr.
Waldengarver
,
''
said
the
man
who
was
on
*NL*
his
knees
,
``
in
which
you
're
out
in
your
reading
.
Now
mind
!
I
do
n't
care
*NL*
who
says
contrairy
;
I
tell
you
so
.
You
're
out
in
your
reading
of
Hamlet
*NL*
when
you
get
your
legs
in
profile
.
The
last
Hamlet
as
I
dressed
,
made
*NL*
the
same
mistakes
in
his
reading
at
rehearsal
,
till
I
got
him
to
put
a
*NL*
large
red
wafer
on
each
of
his
shins
,
and
then
at
that
rehearsal
-LRB-
which
*NL*
was
the
last
-RRB-
I
went
in
front
,
sir
,
to
the
back
of
the
pit
,
and
whenever
*NL*
his
reading
brought
him
into
profile
,
I
called
out
``
I
do
n't
see
no
*NL*
wafers
!
''
And
at
night
his
reading
was
lovely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Waldengarver
smiled
at
me
,
as
much
as
to
say
``
a
faithful
*NL*
Dependent
--
I
overlook
his
folly
;
''
and
then
said
aloud
,
``
My
view
is
a
*NL*
little
classic
and
thoughtful
for
them
here
;
but
they
will
improve
,
they
*NL*
will
improve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
and
I
said
together
,
O
,
no
doubt
they
would
improve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
observe
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Mr.
Waldengarver
,
``
that
there
was
a
*NL*
man
in
the
gallery
who
endeavored
to
cast
derision
on
the
service
,
--
I
*NL*
mean
,
the
representation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
basely
replied
that
we
rather
thought
we
had
noticed
such
a
man
.
I
*NL*
added
,
``
He
was
drunk
,
no
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
dear
no
,
sir
,
''
said
Mr.
Wopsle
,
``
not
drunk
.
His
employer
would
see
to
*NL*
that
,
sir
.
His
employer
would
not
allow
him
to
be
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
his
employer
?
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
shut
his
eyes
,
and
opened
them
again
;
performing
both
*NL*
ceremonies
very
slowly
.
``
You
must
have
observed
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
an
ignorant
and
a
blatant
ass
,
with
a
rasping
throat
and
a
countenance
*NL*
expressive
of
low
malignity
,
who
went
through
--
I
will
not
say
*NL*
sustained
--
the
role
-LRB-
if
I
may
use
a
French
expression
-RRB-
of
Claudius
,
King
*NL*
of
Denmark
.
That
is
his
employer
,
gentlemen
.
Such
is
the
profession
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
distinctly
knowing
whether
I
should
have
been
more
sorry
for
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
if
he
had
been
in
despair
,
I
was
so
sorry
for
him
as
it
was
,
*NL*
that
I
took
the
opportunity
of
his
turning
round
to
have
his
braces
*NL*
put
on
,
--
which
jostled
us
out
at
the
doorway
,
--
to
ask
Herbert
what
he
*NL*
thought
of
having
him
home
to
supper
?
Herbert
said
he
thought
it
would
*NL*
be
kind
to
do
so
;
therefore
I
invited
him
,
and
he
went
to
Barnard
's
*NL*
with
us
,
wrapped
up
to
the
eyes
,
and
we
did
our
best
for
him
,
and
he
sat
*NL*
until
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
reviewing
his
success
and
developing
*NL*
his
plans
.
I
forget
in
detail
what
they
were
,
but
I
have
a
general
*NL*
recollection
that
he
was
to
begin
with
reviving
the
Drama
,
and
to
end
*NL*
with
crushing
it
;
inasmuch
as
his
decease
would
leave
it
utterly
bereft
*NL*
and
without
a
chance
or
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miserably
I
went
to
bed
after
all
,
and
miserably
thought
of
Estella
,
and
*NL*
miserably
dreamed
that
my
expectations
were
all
cancelled
,
and
that
I
*NL*
had
to
give
my
hand
in
marriage
to
Herbert
's
Clara
,
or
play
Hamlet
to
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
's
Ghost
,
before
twenty
thousand
people
,
without
knowing
*NL*
twenty
words
of
it
.

*NL*
Chapter
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
I
was
busy
with
my
books
and
Mr.
Pocket
,
I
received
a
note
*NL*
by
the
post
,
the
mere
outside
of
which
threw
me
into
a
great
flutter
;
*NL*
for
,
though
I
had
never
seen
the
handwriting
in
which
it
was
addressed
,
*NL*
I
divined
whose
hand
it
was
.
It
had
no
set
beginning
,
as
Dear
Mr.
Pip
,
*NL*
or
Dear
Pip
,
or
Dear
Sir
,
or
Dear
Anything
,
but
ran
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
to
come
to
London
the
day
after
to-morrow
by
the
midday
coach
.
I
*NL*
believe
it
was
settled
you
should
meet
me
?
At
all
events
Miss
Havisham
*NL*
has
that
impression
,
and
I
write
in
obedience
to
it
.
She
sends
you
her
*NL*
regard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yours
,
ESTELLA
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
had
been
time
,
I
should
probably
have
ordered
several
suits
*NL*
of
clothes
for
this
occasion
;
but
as
there
was
not
,
I
was
fain
to
be
*NL*
content
with
those
I
had
.
My
appetite
vanished
instantly
,
and
I
knew
*NL*
no
peace
or
rest
until
the
day
arrived
.
Not
that
its
arrival
brought
*NL*
me
either
;
for
,
then
I
was
worse
than
ever
,
and
began
haunting
the
*NL*
coach-office
in
Wood
Street
,
Cheapside
,
before
the
coach
had
left
the
*NL*
Blue
Boar
in
our
town
.
For
all
that
I
knew
this
perfectly
well
,
I
still
*NL*
felt
as
if
it
were
not
safe
to
let
the
coach-office
be
out
of
my
sight
*NL*
longer
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
;
and
in
this
condition
of
unreason
I
*NL*
had
performed
the
first
half-hour
of
a
watch
of
four
or
five
hours
,
when
*NL*
Wemmick
ran
against
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
said
he
;
``
how
do
you
do
?
I
should
hardly
have
thought
*NL*
this
was
your
beat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
explained
that
I
was
waiting
to
meet
somebody
who
was
coming
up
by
*NL*
coach
,
and
I
inquired
after
the
Castle
and
the
Aged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
flourishing
thankye
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
and
particularly
the
Aged
.
*NL*
He
's
in
wonderful
feather
.
He
'll
be
eighty-two
next
birthday
.
I
have
*NL*
a
notion
of
firing
eighty-two
times
,
if
the
neighborhood
should
n't
*NL*
complain
,
and
that
cannon
of
mine
should
prove
equal
to
the
pressure
.
*NL*
However
,
this
is
not
London
talk
.
Where
do
you
think
I
am
going
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
office
?
''
said
I
,
for
he
was
tending
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
thing
to
it
,
''
returned
Wemmick
,
``
I
am
going
to
Newgate
.
We
are
in
*NL*
a
banker
's
-
parcel
case
just
at
present
,
and
I
have
been
down
the
road
*NL*
taking
a
squint
at
the
scene
of
action
,
and
thereupon
must
have
a
word
*NL*
or
two
with
our
client
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
your
client
commit
the
robbery
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
your
soul
and
body
,
no
,
''
answered
Wemmick
,
very
drily
.
``
But
he
*NL*
is
accused
of
it
.
So
might
you
or
I
be
.
Either
of
us
might
be
accused
of
*NL*
it
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
neither
of
us
is
,
''
I
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yah
!
''
said
Wemmick
,
touching
me
on
the
breast
with
his
forefinger
;
*NL*
``
you
're
a
deep
one
,
Mr.
Pip
!
Would
you
like
to
have
a
look
at
Newgate
?
*NL*
Have
you
time
to
spare
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
so
much
time
to
spare
,
that
the
proposal
came
as
a
relief
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
its
irreconcilability
with
my
latent
desire
to
keep
my
*NL*
eye
on
the
coach-office
.
Muttering
that
I
would
make
the
inquiry
whether
*NL*
I
had
time
to
walk
with
him
,
I
went
into
the
office
,
and
ascertained
*NL*
from
the
clerk
with
the
nicest
precision
and
much
to
the
trying
of
his
*NL*
temper
,
the
earliest
moment
at
which
the
coach
could
be
expected
,
--
which
*NL*
I
knew
beforehand
,
quite
as
well
as
he
.
I
then
rejoined
Mr.
Wemmick
,
and
*NL*
affecting
to
consult
my
watch
,
and
to
be
surprised
by
the
information
I
*NL*
had
received
,
accepted
his
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
at
Newgate
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
we
passed
through
the
lodge
*NL*
where
some
fetters
were
hanging
up
on
the
bare
walls
among
the
prison
*NL*
rules
,
into
the
interior
of
the
jail
.
At
that
time
jails
were
much
*NL*
neglected
,
and
the
period
of
exaggerated
reaction
consequent
on
*NL*
all
public
wrongdoing
--
and
which
is
always
its
heaviest
and
longest
*NL*
punishment
--
was
still
far
off
.
So
,
felons
were
not
lodged
and
fed
better
*NL*
than
soldiers
-LRB-
to
say
nothing
of
paupers
-RRB-
,
and
seldom
set
fire
to
their
*NL*
prisons
with
the
excusable
object
of
improving
the
flavor
of
their
soup
.
*NL*
It
was
visiting
time
when
Wemmick
took
me
in
,
and
a
potman
was
going
his
*NL*
rounds
with
beer
;
and
the
prisoners
,
behind
bars
in
yards
,
were
buying
*NL*
beer
,
and
talking
to
friends
;
and
a
frowzy
,
ugly
,
disorderly
,
depressing
*NL*
scene
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
me
that
Wemmick
walked
among
the
prisoners
much
as
a
gardener
*NL*
might
walk
among
his
plants
.
This
was
first
put
into
my
head
by
his
*NL*
seeing
a
shoot
that
had
come
up
in
the
night
,
and
saying
,
``
What
,
Captain
*NL*
Tom
?
Are
you
there
?
Ah
,
indeed
!
''
and
also
,
``
Is
that
Black
Bill
behind
*NL*
the
cistern
?
Why
I
did
n't
look
for
you
these
two
months
;
how
do
you
find
*NL*
yourself
?
''
Equally
in
his
stopping
at
the
bars
and
attending
to
*NL*
anxious
whisperers
,
--
always
singly
,
--
Wemmick
with
his
post-office
in
*NL*
an
immovable
state
,
looked
at
them
while
in
conference
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
taking
particular
notice
of
the
advance
they
had
made
,
since
last
*NL*
observed
,
towards
coming
out
in
full
blow
at
their
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
highly
popular
,
and
I
found
that
he
took
the
familiar
department
*NL*
of
Mr.
Jaggers
's
business
;
though
something
of
the
state
of
Mr.
Jaggers
*NL*
hung
about
him
too
,
forbidding
approach
beyond
certain
limits
.
His
*NL*
personal
recognition
of
each
successive
client
was
comprised
in
a
nod
,
*NL*
and
in
his
settling
his
hat
a
little
easier
on
his
head
with
both
*NL*
hands
,
and
then
tightening
the
post-office
,
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
pockets
.
In
one
or
two
instances
there
was
a
difficulty
respecting
the
*NL*
raising
of
fees
,
and
then
Mr.
Wemmick
,
backing
as
far
as
possible
from
*NL*
the
insufficient
money
produced
,
said
,
``
it
's
no
use
,
my
boy

I
'm
only
*NL*
a
subordinate

I
ca
n't

it

Do
n't
go
on
in
that
way
with
a
*NL*
subordinate
.
If
you
are
unable
to
make
up
your
quantum
,
my
boy
,
you
had
*NL*
better
address
yourself
to
a
principal
;
there
are
plenty
of
principals
*NL*
in
the
profession
,
you
know
,
and
what
is
not
worth
the
while
of
one
,
may
*NL*
be
worth
the
while
of
another
;
that
's
my
recommendation
to
you
,
speaking
*NL*
as
a
subordinate

Do
n't
try
on
useless
measures
.
Why
should
you
?
Now
,
*NL*
who
's
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
we
walked
through
Wemmick
's
greenhouse
,
until
he
turned
to
me
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Notice
the
man
I
shall
shake
hands
with
.
''
I
should
have
done
so
,
*NL*
without
the
preparation
,
as
he
had
shaken
hands
with
no
one
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
,
a
portly
upright
man
-LRB-
whom
I
can
*NL*
see
now
,
as
I
write
-RRB-
in
a
well-worn
olive-colored
frock-coat
,
with
a
*NL*
peculiar
pallor
overspreading
the
red
in
his
complexion
,
and
eyes
that
*NL*
went
wandering
about
when
he
tried
to
fix
them
,
came
up
to
a
corner
*NL*
of
the
bars
,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
hat
--
which
had
a
greasy
and
fatty
*NL*
surface
like
cold
broth
--
with
a
half-serious
and
half-jocose
military
*NL*
salute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
,
to
you
!
''
said
Wemmick
;
``
how
are
you
,
Colonel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
Mr.
Wemmick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
,
but
the
evidence
was
too
strong
*NL*
for
us
,
Colonel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
too
strong
,
sir
,
--
but
I
do
n't
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
coolly
,
``
you
do
n't
care
.
''
Then
,
turning
to
me
,
*NL*
``
Served
His
Majesty
this
man
.
Was
a
soldier
in
the
line
and
bought
his
*NL*
discharge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
``
Indeed
?
''
and
the
man
's
eyes
looked
at
me
,
and
then
looked
over
*NL*
my
head
,
and
then
looked
all
round
me
,
and
then
he
drew
his
hand
across
*NL*
his
lips
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
shall
be
out
of
this
on
Monday
,
sir
,
''
he
said
to
Wemmick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
returned
my
friend
,
``
but
there
's
no
knowing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
have
the
chance
of
bidding
you
good-bye
,
Mr.
Wemmick
,
''
said
*NL*
the
man
,
stretching
out
his
hand
between
two
bars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankye
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
shaking
hands
with
him
.
``
Same
to
you
,
Colonel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
what
I
had
upon
me
when
taken
had
been
real
,
Mr.
Wemmick
,
''
said
the
*NL*
man
,
unwilling
to
let
his
hand
go
,
``
I
should
have
asked
the
favor
of
*NL*
your
wearing
another
ring
--
in
acknowledgment
of
your
attentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
accept
the
will
for
the
deed
,
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
By
the
by
;
you
were
*NL*
quite
a
pigeon-fancier
.
''
The
man
looked
up
at
the
sky
.
``
I
am
told
you
*NL*
had
a
remarkable
breed
of
tumblers
.
Could
you
commission
any
friend
of
*NL*
yours
to
bring
me
a
pair
,
if
you
've
no
further
use
for
'em
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
done
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
they
shall
be
taken
care
of
.
Good
afternoon
,
*NL*
Colonel
.
Good-bye
!
''
They
shook
hands
again
,
and
as
we
walked
away
Wemmick
*NL*
said
to
me
,
``
A
Coiner
,
a
very
good
workman
.
The
Recorder
's
report
is
*NL*
made
to-day
,
and
he
is
sure
to
be
executed
on
Monday
.
Still
you
see
,
as
*NL*
far
as
it
goes
,
a
pair
of
pigeons
are
portable
property
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
With
that
,
he
looked
back
,
and
nodded
at
this
dead
plant
,
and
then
cast
*NL*
his
eyes
about
him
in
walking
out
of
the
yard
,
as
if
he
were
considering
*NL*
what
other
pot
would
go
best
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
came
out
of
the
prison
through
the
lodge
,
I
found
that
the
great
*NL*
importance
of
my
guardian
was
appreciated
by
the
turnkeys
,
no
less
*NL*
than
by
those
whom
they
held
in
charge
.
``
Well
,
Mr.
Wemmick
,
''
said
the
*NL*
turnkey
,
who
kept
us
between
the
two
studded
and
spiked
lodge
gates
,
*NL*
and
who
carefully
locked
one
before
he
unlocked
the
other
,
``
what
's
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
going
to
do
with
that
water-side
murder
?
Is
he
going
to
make
it
*NL*
manslaughter
,
or
what
's
he
going
to
make
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
ask
him
?
''
returned
Wemmick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
I
dare
say
!
''
said
the
turnkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
that
's
the
way
with
them
here
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
remarked
Wemmick
,
turning
*NL*
to
me
with
his
post-office
elongated
.
``
They
do
n't
mind
what
they
ask
of
*NL*
me
,
the
subordinate
;
but
you
'll
never
catch
'em
asking
any
questions
of
*NL*
my
principal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
young
gentleman
one
of
the
`
prentices
or
articled
ones
of
your
*NL*
office
?
''
asked
the
turnkey
,
with
a
grin
at
Mr.
Wemmick
's
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
goes
again
,
you
see
!
''
cried
Wemmick
,
``
I
told
you
so
!
Asks
*NL*
another
question
of
the
subordinate
before
his
first
is
dry
!
Well
,
*NL*
supposing
Mr.
Pip
is
one
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
then
,
''
said
the
turnkey
,
grinning
again
,
``
he
knows
what
Mr.
Jaggers
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yah
!
''
cried
Wemmick
,
suddenly
hitting
out
at
the
turnkey
in
a
facetious
*NL*
way
,
``
you
're
dumb
as
one
of
your
own
keys
when
you
have
to
do
with
my
*NL*
principal
,
you
know
you
are
.
Let
us
out
,
you
old
fox
,
or
I
'll
get
him
to
*NL*
bring
an
action
against
you
for
false
imprisonment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
turnkey
laughed
,
and
gave
us
good
day
,
and
stood
laughing
at
us
over
*NL*
the
spikes
of
the
wicket
when
we
descended
the
steps
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
gravely
in
my
ear
,
as
he
took
my
arm
*NL*
to
be
more
confidential
;
``
I
do
n't
know
that
Mr.
Jaggers
does
a
better
*NL*
thing
than
the
way
in
which
he
keeps
himself
so
high
.
He
's
always
so
*NL*
high
.
His
constant
height
is
of
a
piece
with
his
immense
abilities
.
That
*NL*
Colonel
durst
no
more
take
leave
of
him
,
than
that
turnkey
durst
ask
him
*NL*
his
intentions
respecting
a
case
.
Then
,
between
his
height
and
them
,
he
*NL*
slips
in
his
subordinate
,
--
do
n't
you
see
?
--
and
so
he
has
'em
,
soul
and
*NL*
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
much
impressed
,
and
not
for
the
first
time
,
by
my
guardian
's
*NL*
subtlety
.
To
confess
the
truth
,
I
very
heartily
wished
,
and
not
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
that
I
had
had
some
other
guardian
of
minor
abilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Wemmick
and
I
parted
at
the
office
in
Little
Britain
,
where
*NL*
suppliants
for
Mr.
Jaggers
's
notice
were
lingering
about
as
usual
,
and
I
*NL*
returned
to
my
watch
in
the
street
of
the
coach-office
,
with
some
three
*NL*
hours
on
hand
.
I
consumed
the
whole
time
in
thinking
how
strange
it
*NL*
was
that
I
should
be
encompassed
by
all
this
taint
of
prison
and
crime
;
*NL*
that
,
in
my
childhood
out
on
our
lonely
marshes
on
a
winter
evening
,
I
*NL*
should
have
first
encountered
it
;
that
,
it
should
have
reappeared
on
two
*NL*
occasions
,
starting
out
like
a
stain
that
was
faded
but
not
gone
;
that
,
*NL*
it
should
in
this
new
way
pervade
my
fortune
and
advancement
.
While
my
*NL*
mind
was
thus
engaged
,
I
thought
of
the
beautiful
young
Estella
,
proud
*NL*
and
refined
,
coming
towards
me
,
and
I
thought
with
absolute
abhorrence
*NL*
of
the
contrast
between
the
jail
and
her
.
I
wished
that
Wemmick
had
not
*NL*
met
me
,
or
that
I
had
not
yielded
to
him
and
gone
with
him
,
so
that
,
*NL*
of
all
days
in
the
year
on
this
day
,
I
might
not
have
had
Newgate
in
*NL*
my
breath
and
on
my
clothes
.
I
beat
the
prison
dust
off
my
feet
as
I
*NL*
sauntered
to
and
fro
,
and
I
shook
it
out
of
my
dress
,
and
I
exhaled
*NL*
its
air
from
my
lungs
.
So
contaminated
did
I
feel
,
remembering
who
was
*NL*
coming
,
that
the
coach
came
quickly
after
all
,
and
I
was
not
yet
free
*NL*
from
the
soiling
consciousness
of
Mr.
Wemmick
's
conservatory
,
when
I
saw
*NL*
her
face
at
the
coach
window
and
her
hand
waving
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
the
nameless
shadow
which
again
in
that
one
instant
had
passed
?

Chapter
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
furred
travelling-dress
,
Estella
seemed
more
delicately
beautiful
*NL*
than
she
had
ever
seemed
yet
,
even
in
my
eyes
.
Her
manner
was
more
*NL*
winning
than
she
had
cared
to
let
it
be
to
me
before
,
and
I
thought
I
*NL*
saw
Miss
Havisham
's
influence
in
the
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stood
in
the
Inn
Yard
while
she
pointed
out
her
luggage
to
me
,
and
*NL*
when
it
was
all
collected
I
remembered
--
having
forgotten
everything
but
*NL*
herself
in
the
meanwhile
--
that
I
knew
nothing
of
her
destination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
Richmond
,
''
she
told
me
.
``
Our
lesson
is
,
that
there
are
*NL*
two
Richmonds
,
one
in
Surrey
and
one
in
Yorkshire
,
and
that
mine
is
the
*NL*
Surrey
Richmond
.
The
distance
is
ten
miles
.
I
am
to
have
a
carriage
,
and
*NL*
you
are
to
take
me
.
This
is
my
purse
,
and
you
are
to
pay
my
charges
out
*NL*
of
it
.
O
,
you
must
take
the
purse
!
We
have
no
choice
,
you
and
I
,
but
to
*NL*
obey
our
instructions
.
We
are
not
free
to
follow
our
own
devices
,
you
*NL*
and
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
looked
at
me
in
giving
me
the
purse
,
I
hoped
there
was
an
*NL*
inner
meaning
in
her
words
.
She
said
them
slightingly
,
but
not
with
*NL*
displeasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
carriage
will
have
to
be
sent
for
,
Estella
.
Will
you
rest
here
a
*NL*
little
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
to
rest
here
a
little
,
and
I
am
to
drink
some
tea
,
and
you
*NL*
are
to
take
care
of
me
the
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
her
arm
through
mine
,
as
if
it
must
be
done
,
and
I
requested
a
*NL*
waiter
who
had
been
staring
at
the
coach
like
a
man
who
had
never
seen
*NL*
such
a
thing
in
his
life
,
to
show
us
a
private
sitting-room
.
Upon
that
,
*NL*
he
pulled
out
a
napkin
,
as
if
it
were
a
magic
clew
without
which
he
*NL*
could
n't
find
the
way
upstairs
,
and
led
us
to
the
black
hole
of
the
*NL*
establishment
,
fitted
up
with
a
diminishing
mirror
-LRB-
quite
a
superfluous
*NL*
article
,
considering
the
hole
's
proportions
-RRB-
,
an
anchovy
sauce-cruet
,
*NL*
and
somebody
's
pattens
.
On
my
objecting
to
this
retreat
,
he
took
us
into
*NL*
another
room
with
a
dinner-table
for
thirty
,
and
in
the
grate
a
scorched
*NL*
leaf
of
a
copy-book
under
a
bushel
of
coal-dust
.
Having
looked
at
this
*NL*
extinct
conflagration
and
shaken
his
head
,
he
took
my
order
;
which
,
*NL*
proving
to
be
merely
,
``
Some
tea
for
the
lady
,
''
sent
him
out
of
the
room
*NL*
in
a
very
low
state
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
,
and
I
am
,
sensible
that
the
air
of
this
chamber
,
in
its
strong
*NL*
combination
of
stable
with
soup-stock
,
might
have
led
one
to
infer
that
*NL*
the
coaching
department
was
not
doing
well
,
and
that
the
enterprising
*NL*
proprietor
was
boiling
down
the
horses
for
the
refreshment
department
.
*NL*
Yet
the
room
was
all
in
all
to
me
,
Estella
being
in
it
.
I
thought
that
*NL*
with
her
I
could
have
been
happy
there
for
life
.
-LRB-
I
was
not
at
all
happy
*NL*
there
at
the
time
,
observe
,
and
I
knew
it
well
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
to
,
at
Richmond
?
''
I
asked
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
live
,
''
said
she
,
``
at
a
great
expense
,
with
a
lady
there
,
*NL*
who
has
the
power
--
or
says
she
has
--
of
taking
me
about
,
and
introducing
*NL*
me
,
and
showing
people
to
me
and
showing
me
to
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
will
be
glad
of
variety
and
admiration
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
suppose
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
so
carelessly
,
that
I
said
,
``
You
speak
of
yourself
as
if
*NL*
you
were
some
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
learn
how
I
speak
of
others
?
Come
,
come

said
Estella
,
*NL*
smiling
delightfully
,
``
you
must
not
expect
me
to
go
to
school
to
you
;
I
*NL*
must
talk
in
my
own
way
.
How
do
you
thrive
with
Mr.
Pocket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
live
quite
pleasantly
there
;
at
least
--
''
It
appeared
to
me
that
I
was
*NL*
losing
a
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
?
''
repeated
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
pleasantly
as
I
could
anywhere
,
away
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
silly
boy
,
''
said
Estella
,
quite
composedly
,
``
how
can
you
talk
such
*NL*
nonsense
?
Your
friend
Mr.
Matthew
,
I
believe
,
is
superior
to
the
rest
of
*NL*
his
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
superior
indeed
.
He
is
nobody
's
enemy
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
add
but
his
own
,
''
interposed
Estella
,
``
for
I
hate
that
class
of
*NL*
man
.
But
he
really
is
disinterested
,
and
above
small
jealousy
and
spite
,
*NL*
I
have
heard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
have
every
reason
to
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
every
reason
to
say
so
of
the
rest
of
his
people
,
''
said
*NL*
Estella
,
nodding
at
me
with
an
expression
of
face
that
was
at
once
*NL*
grave
and
rallying
,
``
for
they
beset
Miss
Havisham
with
reports
and
*NL*
insinuations
to
your
disadvantage
.
They
watch
you
,
misrepresent
you
,
*NL*
write
letters
about
you
-LRB-
anonymous
sometimes
-RRB-
,
and
you
are
the
torment
*NL*
and
the
occupation
of
their
lives
.
You
can
scarcely
realize
to
yourself
*NL*
the
hatred
those
people
feel
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
me
no
harm
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
answering
,
Estella
burst
out
laughing
.
This
was
very
singular
*NL*
to
me
,
and
I
looked
at
her
in
considerable
perplexity
.
When
she
left
*NL*
off
--
and
she
had
not
laughed
languidly
,
but
with
real
enjoyment
--
I
said
,
*NL*
in
my
diffident
way
with
her
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
may
suppose
that
you
would
not
be
amused
if
they
did
me
any
*NL*
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
you
may
be
sure
of
that
,
''
said
Estella
.
``
You
may
be
certain
that
*NL*
I
laugh
because
they
fail
.
O
,
those
people
with
Miss
Havisham
,
and
the
*NL*
tortures
they
undergo
!
''
She
laughed
again
,
and
even
now
when
she
had
*NL*
told
me
why
,
her
laughter
was
very
singular
to
me
,
for
I
could
not
*NL*
doubt
its
being
genuine
,
and
yet
it
seemed
too
much
for
the
occasion
.
*NL*
I
thought
there
must
really
be
something
more
here
than
I
knew
;
she
saw
*NL*
the
thought
in
my
mind
,
and
answered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
easy
for
even
you
.
''
said
Estella
,
``
to
know
what
satisfaction
*NL*
it
gives
me
to
see
those
people
thwarted
,
or
what
an
enjoyable
sense
of
*NL*
the
ridiculous
I
have
when
they
are
made
ridiculous
.
For
you
were
not
*NL*
brought
up
in
that
strange
house
from
a
mere
baby
.
I
was
.
You
had
not
*NL*
your
little
wits
sharpened
by
their
intriguing
against
you
,
suppressed
*NL*
and
defenceless
,
under
the
mask
of
sympathy
and
pity
and
what
not
that
*NL*
is
soft
and
soothing
.
I
had
.
You
did
not
gradually
open
your
round
*NL*
childish
eyes
wider
and
wider
to
the
discovery
of
that
impostor
of
a
*NL*
woman
who
calculates
her
stores
of
peace
of
mind
for
when
she
wakes
up
*NL*
in
the
night
.
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
laughing
matter
with
Estella
now
,
nor
was
she
summoning
these
*NL*
remembrances
from
any
shallow
place
.
I
would
not
have
been
the
cause
of
*NL*
that
look
of
hers
for
all
my
expectations
in
a
heap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
things
I
can
tell
you
,
''
said
Estella
.
``
First
,
notwithstanding
the
*NL*
proverb
that
constant
dropping
will
wear
away
a
stone
,
you
may
set
*NL*
your
mind
at
rest
that
these
people
never
will
--
never
would
,
in
hundred
*NL*
years
--
impair
your
ground
with
Miss
Havisham
,
in
any
particular
,
great
*NL*
or
small
.
Second
,
I
am
beholden
to
you
as
the
cause
of
their
being
so
*NL*
busy
and
so
mean
in
vain
,
and
there
is
my
hand
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
gave
it
to
me
playfully
,
--
for
her
darker
mood
had
been
but
*NL*
Momentary
,
--
I
held
it
and
put
it
to
my
lips
.
``
You
ridiculous
boy
,
''
said
*NL*
Estella
,
``
will
you
never
take
warning
?
Or
do
you
kiss
my
hand
in
the
*NL*
same
spirit
in
which
I
once
let
you
kiss
my
cheek
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
spirit
was
that
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
think
a
moment
.
A
spirit
of
contempt
for
the
fawners
and
*NL*
plotters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
say
yes
,
may
I
kiss
the
cheek
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
asked
before
you
touched
the
hand
.
But
,
yes
,
if
you
*NL*
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
leaned
down
,
and
her
calm
face
was
like
a
statue
's
.
``
Now
,
''
said
*NL*
Estella
,
gliding
away
the
instant
I
touched
her
cheek
,
``
you
are
to
take
*NL*
care
that
I
have
some
tea
,
and
you
are
to
take
me
to
Richmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
reverting
to
this
tone
as
if
our
association
were
forced
upon
*NL*
us
,
and
we
were
mere
puppets
,
gave
me
pain
;
but
everything
in
our
*NL*
intercourse
did
give
me
pain
.
Whatever
her
tone
with
me
happened
to
be
,
*NL*
I
could
put
no
trust
in
it
,
and
build
no
hope
on
it
;
and
yet
I
went
on
*NL*
against
trust
and
against
hope
.
Why
repeat
it
a
thousand
times
?
So
it
*NL*
always
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
rang
for
the
tea
,
and
the
waiter
,
reappearing
with
his
magic
clew
,
*NL*
brought
in
by
degrees
some
fifty
adjuncts
to
that
refreshment
,
but
of
*NL*
tea
not
a
glimpse
.
A
teaboard
,
cups
and
saucers
,
plates
,
knives
and
*NL*
forks
-LRB-
including
carvers
-RRB-
,
spoons
-LRB-
various
-RRB-
,
saltcellars
,
a
meek
little
*NL*
muffin
confined
with
the
utmost
precaution
under
a
strong
iron
cover
,
*NL*
Moses
in
the
bulrushes
typified
by
a
soft
bit
of
butter
in
a
quantity
of
*NL*
parsley
,
a
pale
loaf
with
a
powdered
head
,
two
proof
impressions
of
*NL*
the
bars
of
the
kitchen
fireplace
on
triangular
bits
of
bread
,
and
*NL*
ultimately
a
fat
family
urn
;
which
the
waiter
staggered
in
with
,
*NL*
expressing
in
his
countenance
burden
and
suffering
.
After
a
prolonged
*NL*
absence
at
this
stage
of
the
entertainment
,
he
at
length
came
back
with
*NL*
a
casket
of
precious
appearance
containing
twigs
.
These
I
steeped
in
hot
*NL*
water
,
and
so
from
the
whole
of
these
appliances
extracted
one
cup
of
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
for
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bill
paid
,
and
the
waiter
remembered
,
and
the
ostler
not
forgotten
,
*NL*
and
the
chambermaid
taken
into
consideration
,
--
in
a
word
,
the
whole
*NL*
house
bribed
into
a
state
of
contempt
and
animosity
,
and
Estella
's
purse
*NL*
much
lightened
,
--
we
got
into
our
post-coach
and
drove
away
.
Turning
into
*NL*
Cheapside
and
rattling
up
Newgate
Street
,
we
were
soon
under
the
walls
*NL*
of
which
I
was
so
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
place
is
that
?
''
Estella
asked
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
a
foolish
pretence
of
not
at
first
recognizing
it
,
and
then
*NL*
told
her
.
As
she
looked
at
it
,
and
drew
in
her
head
again
,
*NL*
murmuring
,
``
Wretches
!
''
I
would
not
have
confessed
to
my
visit
for
any
*NL*
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jaggers
,
''
said
I
,
by
way
of
putting
it
neatly
on
somebody
else
,
*NL*
``
has
the
reputation
of
being
more
in
the
secrets
of
that
dismal
place
*NL*
than
any
man
in
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
more
in
the
secrets
of
every
place
,
I
think
,
''
said
Estella
,
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
accustomed
to
see
him
often
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
accustomed
to
see
him
at
uncertain
intervals
,
ever
since
*NL*
I
can
remember
.
But
I
know
him
no
better
now
,
than
I
did
before
I
could
*NL*
speak
plainly
.
What
is
your
own
experience
of
him
?
Do
you
advance
with
*NL*
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
habituated
to
his
distrustful
manner
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
have
done
very
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
intimate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
dined
with
him
at
his
private
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
,
''
said
Estella
,
shrinking
``
that
must
be
a
curious
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
curious
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
been
chary
of
discussing
my
guardian
too
freely
even
with
*NL*
her
;
but
I
should
have
gone
on
with
the
subject
so
far
as
to
describe
*NL*
the
dinner
in
Gerrard
Street
,
if
we
had
not
then
come
into
a
sudden
*NL*
glare
of
gas
.
It
seemed
,
while
it
lasted
,
to
be
all
alight
and
alive
*NL*
with
that
inexplicable
feeling
I
had
had
before
;
and
when
we
were
out
of
*NL*
it
,
I
was
as
much
dazed
for
a
few
moments
as
if
I
had
been
in
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
fell
into
other
talk
,
and
it
was
principally
about
the
way
by
*NL*
which
we
were
travelling
,
and
about
what
parts
of
London
lay
on
this
*NL*
side
of
it
,
and
what
on
that
.
The
great
city
was
almost
new
to
her
,
she
*NL*
told
me
,
for
she
had
never
left
Miss
Havisham
's
neighborhood
until
she
*NL*
had
gone
to
France
,
and
she
had
merely
passed
through
London
then
in
*NL*
going
and
returning
.
I
asked
her
if
my
guardian
had
any
charge
of
her
*NL*
while
she
remained
here
?
To
that
she
emphatically
said
``
God
forbid
!
''
and
*NL*
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
avoid
seeing
that
she
cared
to
attract
me
;
*NL*
that
she
made
herself
winning
,
and
would
have
won
me
even
if
the
task
*NL*
had
needed
pains
.
Yet
this
made
me
none
the
happier
,
for
even
if
she
had
*NL*
not
taken
that
tone
of
our
being
disposed
of
by
others
,
I
should
have
*NL*
felt
that
she
held
my
heart
in
her
hand
because
she
wilfully
chose
to
do
*NL*
it
,
and
not
because
it
would
have
wrung
any
tenderness
in
her
to
crush
*NL*
it
and
throw
it
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
passed
through
Hammersmith
,
I
showed
her
where
Mr.
Matthew
*NL*
Pocket
lived
,
and
said
it
was
no
great
way
from
Richmond
,
and
that
I
*NL*
hoped
I
should
see
her
sometimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
you
are
to
see
me
;
you
are
to
come
when
you
think
proper
;
you
*NL*
are
to
be
mentioned
to
the
family
;
indeed
you
are
already
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
inquired
was
it
a
large
household
she
was
going
to
be
a
member
of
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
there
are
only
two
;
mother
and
daughter
.
The
mother
is
a
lady
of
*NL*
some
station
,
though
not
averse
to
increasing
her
income
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
Miss
Havisham
could
part
with
you
again
so
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
part
of
Miss
Havisham
's
plans
for
me
,
Pip
,
''
said
Estella
,
with
*NL*
a
sigh
,
as
if
she
were
tired
;
``
I
am
to
write
to
her
constantly
and
see
*NL*
her
regularly
and
report
how
I
go
on
,
--
I
and
the
jewels
,
--
for
they
are
*NL*
nearly
all
mine
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
called
me
by
my
name
.
Of
course
she
*NL*
did
so
purposely
,
and
knew
that
I
should
treasure
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
to
Richmond
all
too
soon
,
and
our
destination
there
was
a
house
*NL*
by
the
green
,
--
a
staid
old
house
,
where
hoops
and
powder
and
patches
,
*NL*
embroidered
coats
,
rolled
stockings
,
ruffles
and
swords
,
had
had
their
*NL*
court
days
many
a
time
.
Some
ancient
trees
before
the
house
were
still
*NL*
cut
into
fashions
as
formal
and
unnatural
as
the
hoops
and
wigs
and
*NL*
stiff
skirts
;
but
their
own
allotted
places
in
the
great
procession
of
*NL*
the
dead
were
not
far
off
,
and
they
would
soon
drop
into
them
and
go
the
*NL*
silent
way
of
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
bell
with
an
old
voice
--
which
I
dare
say
in
its
time
had
often
said
*NL*
to
the
house
,
Here
is
the
green
farthingale
,
Here
is
the
diamond-hilted
*NL*
sword
,
Here
are
the
shoes
with
red
heels
and
the
blue
solitaire
--
sounded
*NL*
gravely
in
the
moonlight
,
and
two
cherry-colored
maids
came
fluttering
*NL*
out
to
receive
Estella
.
The
doorway
soon
absorbed
her
boxes
,
and
she
*NL*
gave
me
her
hand
and
a
smile
,
and
said
good
night
,
and
was
absorbed
*NL*
likewise
.
And
still
I
stood
looking
at
the
house
,
thinking
how
happy
I
*NL*
should
be
if
I
lived
there
with
her
,
and
knowing
that
I
never
was
happy
*NL*
with
her
,
but
always
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
into
the
carriage
to
be
taken
back
to
Hammersmith
,
and
I
got
in
*NL*
with
a
bad
heart-ache
,
and
I
got
out
with
a
worse
heart-ache
.
At
our
*NL*
own
door
,
I
found
little
Jane
Pocket
coming
home
from
a
little
party
*NL*
escorted
by
her
little
lover
;
and
I
envied
her
little
lover
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
his
being
subject
to
Flopson
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pocket
was
out
lecturing
;
for
,
he
was
a
most
delightful
lecturer
on
*NL*
domestic
economy
,
and
his
treatises
on
the
management
of
children
and
*NL*
servants
were
considered
the
very
best
text-books
on
those
themes
.
But
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocket
was
at
home
,
and
was
in
a
little
difficulty
,
on
account
of
*NL*
the
baby
's
having
been
accommodated
with
a
needle-case
to
keep
him
quiet
*NL*
during
the
unaccountable
absence
-LRB-
with
a
relative
in
the
Foot
Guards
-RRB-
*NL*
of
Millers
.
And
more
needles
were
missing
than
it
could
be
regarded
*NL*
as
quite
wholesome
for
a
patient
of
such
tender
years
either
to
apply
*NL*
externally
or
to
take
as
a
tonic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pocket
being
justly
celebrated
for
giving
most
excellent
practical
*NL*
advice
,
and
for
having
a
clear
and
sound
perception
of
things
and
a
*NL*
highly
judicious
mind
,
I
had
some
notion
in
my
heart-ache
of
begging
him
*NL*
to
accept
my
confidence
.
But
happening
to
look
up
at
Mrs.
Pocket
as
she
*NL*
sat
reading
her
book
of
dignities
after
prescribing
Bed
as
a
sovereign
*NL*
remedy
for
baby
,
I
thought
--
Well
--
No
,
I
would
n't
.

Chapter
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
had
grown
accustomed
to
my
expectations
,
I
had
insensibly
begun
to
*NL*
notice
their
effect
upon
myself
and
those
around
me
.
Their
influence
on
*NL*
my
own
character
I
disguised
from
my
recognition
as
much
as
possible
,
*NL*
but
I
knew
very
well
that
it
was
not
all
good
.
I
lived
in
a
state
of
*NL*
chronic
uneasiness
respecting
my
behavior
to
Joe
.
My
conscience
was
not
*NL*
by
any
means
comfortable
about
Biddy
.
When
I
woke
up
in
the
night
,
--
like
*NL*
Camilla
,
--
I
used
to
think
,
with
a
weariness
on
my
spirits
,
that
I
should
*NL*
have
been
happier
and
better
if
I
had
never
seen
Miss
Havisham
's
face
,
*NL*
and
had
risen
to
manhood
content
to
be
partners
with
Joe
in
the
honest
*NL*
old
forge
.
Many
a
time
of
an
evening
,
when
I
sat
alone
looking
at
the
*NL*
fire
,
I
thought
,
after
all
there
was
no
fire
like
the
forge
fire
and
the
*NL*
kitchen
fire
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Estella
was
so
inseparable
from
all
my
restlessness
and
disquiet
of
*NL*
mind
,
that
I
really
fell
into
confusion
as
to
the
limits
of
my
own
part
*NL*
in
its
production
.
That
is
to
say
,
supposing
I
had
had
no
expectations
,
*NL*
and
yet
had
had
Estella
to
think
of
,
I
could
not
make
out
to
my
*NL*
satisfaction
that
I
should
have
done
much
better
.
Now
,
concerning
the
*NL*
influence
of
my
position
on
others
,
I
was
in
no
such
difficulty
,
and
so
*NL*
I
perceived
--
though
dimly
enough
perhaps
--
that
it
was
not
beneficial
*NL*
to
anybody
,
and
,
above
all
,
that
it
was
not
beneficial
to
Herbert
.
*NL*
My
lavish
habits
led
his
easy
nature
into
expenses
that
he
could
not
*NL*
afford
,
corrupted
the
simplicity
of
his
life
,
and
disturbed
his
peace
*NL*
with
anxieties
and
regrets
.
I
was
not
at
all
remorseful
for
having
*NL*
unwittingly
set
those
other
branches
of
the
Pocket
family
to
the
poor
*NL*
arts
they
practised
;
because
such
littlenesses
were
their
natural
*NL*
bent
,
and
would
have
been
evoked
by
anybody
else
,
if
I
had
left
them
*NL*
slumbering
.
But
Herbert
's
was
a
very
different
case
,
and
it
often
caused
*NL*
me
a
twinge
to
think
that
I
had
done
him
evil
service
in
crowding
his
*NL*
sparely
furnished
chambers
with
incongruous
upholstery
work
,
and
placing
*NL*
the
Canary-breasted
Avenger
at
his
disposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
now
,
as
an
infallible
way
of
making
little
ease
great
ease
,
I
began
*NL*
to
contract
a
quantity
of
debt
.
I
could
hardly
begin
but
Herbert
*NL*
must
begin
too
,
so
he
soon
followed
.
At
Startop
's
suggestion
,
we
put
*NL*
ourselves
down
for
election
into
a
club
called
The
Finches
of
the
Grove
:
*NL*
the
object
of
which
institution
I
have
never
divined
,
if
it
were
not
*NL*
that
the
members
should
dine
expensively
once
a
fortnight
,
to
quarrel
*NL*
among
themselves
as
much
as
possible
after
dinner
,
and
to
cause
six
*NL*
waiters
to
get
drunk
on
the
stairs
.
I
know
that
these
gratifying
social
*NL*
ends
were
so
invariably
accomplished
,
that
Herbert
and
I
understood
*NL*
nothing
else
to
be
referred
to
in
the
first
standing
toast
of
the
*NL*
society
:
which
ran
``
Gentlemen
,
may
the
present
promotion
of
good
feeling
*NL*
ever
reign
predominant
among
the
Finches
of
the
Grove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Finches
spent
their
money
foolishly
-LRB-
the
Hotel
we
dined
at
was
*NL*
in
Covent
Garden
-RRB-
,
and
the
first
Finch
I
saw
when
I
had
the
honor
of
*NL*
joining
the
Grove
was
Bentley
Drummle
,
at
that
time
floundering
about
*NL*
town
in
a
cab
of
his
own
,
and
doing
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
the
posts
*NL*
at
the
street
corners
.
Occasionally
,
he
shot
himself
out
of
his
equipage
*NL*
headforemost
over
the
apron
;
and
I
saw
him
on
one
occasion
deliver
*NL*
himself
at
the
door
of
the
Grove
in
this
unintentional
way
--
like
coals
.
*NL*
But
here
I
anticipate
a
little
,
for
I
was
not
a
Finch
,
and
could
not
be
,
*NL*
according
to
the
sacred
laws
of
the
society
,
until
I
came
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
confidence
in
my
own
resources
,
I
would
willingly
have
taken
*NL*
Herbert
's
expenses
on
myself
;
but
Herbert
was
proud
,
and
I
could
make
*NL*
no
such
proposal
to
him
.
So
he
got
into
difficulties
in
every
direction
,
*NL*
and
continued
to
look
about
him
.
When
we
gradually
fell
into
keeping
*NL*
late
hours
and
late
company
,
I
noticed
that
he
looked
about
him
with
a
*NL*
desponding
eye
at
breakfast-time
;
that
he
began
to
look
about
him
more
*NL*
hopefully
about
mid-day
;
that
he
drooped
when
he
came
into
dinner
;
*NL*
that
he
seemed
to
descry
Capital
in
the
distance
,
rather
clearly
,
after
*NL*
dinner
;
that
he
all
but
realized
Capital
towards
midnight
;
and
that
at
*NL*
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
he
became
so
deeply
despondent
again
*NL*
as
to
talk
of
buying
a
rifle
and
going
to
America
,
with
a
general
*NL*
purpose
of
compelling
buffaloes
to
make
his
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
usually
at
Hammersmith
about
half
the
week
,
and
when
I
was
at
*NL*
Hammersmith
I
haunted
Richmond
,
whereof
separately
by
and
by
.
Herbert
*NL*
would
often
come
to
Hammersmith
when
I
was
there
,
and
I
think
at
those
*NL*
seasons
his
father
would
occasionally
have
some
passing
perception
that
*NL*
the
opening
he
was
looking
for
,
had
not
appeared
yet
.
But
in
the
general
*NL*
tumbling
up
of
the
family
,
his
tumbling
out
in
life
somewhere
,
was
*NL*
a
thing
to
transact
itself
somehow
.
In
the
meantime
Mr.
Pocket
grew
*NL*
grayer
,
and
tried
oftener
to
lift
himself
out
of
his
perplexities
by
the
*NL*
hair
.
While
Mrs.
Pocket
tripped
up
the
family
with
her
footstool
,
read
*NL*
her
book
of
dignities
,
lost
her
pocket-handkerchief
,
told
us
about
her
*NL*
grandpapa
,
and
taught
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
,
by
shooting
it
into
*NL*
bed
whenever
it
attracted
her
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
am
now
generalizing
a
period
of
my
life
with
the
object
of
clearing
*NL*
my
way
before
me
,
I
can
scarcely
do
so
better
than
by
at
once
completing
*NL*
the
description
of
our
usual
manners
and
customs
at
Barnard
's
Inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
spent
as
much
money
as
we
could
,
and
got
as
little
for
it
as
people
*NL*
could
make
up
their
minds
to
give
us
.
We
were
always
more
or
less
*NL*
miserable
,
and
most
of
our
acquaintance
were
in
the
same
condition
.
*NL*
There
was
a
gay
fiction
among
us
that
we
were
constantly
enjoying
*NL*
ourselves
,
and
a
skeleton
truth
that
we
never
did
.
To
the
best
of
my
*NL*
belief
,
our
case
was
in
the
last
aspect
a
rather
common
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
,
with
an
air
ever
new
,
Herbert
went
into
the
City
to
look
*NL*
about
him
.
I
often
paid
him
a
visit
in
the
dark
back-room
in
which
*NL*
he
consorted
with
an
ink-jar
,
a
hat-peg
,
a
coal-box
,
a
string-box
,
an
*NL*
almanac
,
a
desk
and
stool
,
and
a
ruler
;
and
I
do
not
remember
that
I
*NL*
ever
saw
him
do
anything
else
but
look
about
him
.
If
we
all
did
what
*NL*
we
undertake
to
do
,
as
faithfully
as
Herbert
did
,
we
might
live
in
a
*NL*
Republic
of
the
Virtues
.
He
had
nothing
else
to
do
,
poor
fellow
,
except
*NL*
at
a
certain
hour
of
every
afternoon
to
``
go
to
Lloyd
's
''
--
in
observance
*NL*
of
a
ceremony
of
seeing
his
principal
,
I
think
.
He
never
did
anything
*NL*
else
in
connection
with
Lloyd
's
that
I
could
find
out
,
except
come
back
*NL*
again
.
When
he
felt
his
case
unusually
serious
,
and
that
he
positively
*NL*
must
find
an
opening
,
he
would
go
on
`
Change
at
a
busy
time
,
and
walk
in
*NL*
and
out
,
in
a
kind
of
gloomy
country
dance
figure
,
among
the
assembled
*NL*
magnates
.
``
For
,
''
says
Herbert
to
me
,
coming
home
to
dinner
on
one
*NL*
of
those
special
occasions
,
``
I
find
the
truth
to
be
,
Handel
,
that
an
*NL*
opening
wo
n't
come
to
one
,
but
one
must
go
to
it
,
--
so
I
have
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
had
been
less
attached
to
one
another
,
I
think
we
must
have
hated
*NL*
one
another
regularly
every
morning
.
I
detested
the
chambers
beyond
*NL*
expression
at
that
period
of
repentance
,
and
could
not
endure
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
Avenger
's
livery
;
which
had
a
more
expensive
and
a
*NL*
less
remunerative
appearance
then
than
at
any
other
time
in
the
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
.
As
we
got
more
and
more
into
debt
,
breakfast
*NL*
became
a
hollower
and
hollower
form
,
and
,
being
on
one
occasion
at
*NL*
breakfast-time
threatened
-LRB-
by
letter
-RRB-
with
legal
proceedings
,
``
not
*NL*
unwholly
unconnected
,
''
as
my
local
paper
might
put
it
,
``
with
jewelery
,
''
*NL*
I
went
so
far
as
to
seize
the
Avenger
by
his
blue
collar
and
shake
*NL*
him
off
his
feet
,
--
so
that
he
was
actually
in
the
air
,
like
a
booted
*NL*
Cupid
,
--
for
presuming
to
suppose
that
we
wanted
a
roll
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
certain
times
--
meaning
at
uncertain
times
,
for
they
depended
on
our
*NL*
humor
--
I
would
say
to
Herbert
,
as
if
it
were
a
remarkable
discovery
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Herbert
,
we
are
getting
on
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Handel
,
''
Herbert
would
say
to
me
,
in
all
sincerity
,
``
if
you
will
*NL*
believe
me
,
those
very
words
were
on
my
lips
,
by
a
strange
coincidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Herbert
,
''
I
would
respond
,
``
let
us
look
into
our
affairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
always
derived
profound
satisfaction
from
making
an
appointment
for
*NL*
this
purpose
.
I
always
thought
this
was
business
,
this
was
the
way
to
*NL*
confront
the
thing
,
this
was
the
way
to
take
the
foe
by
the
throat
.
And
*NL*
I
know
Herbert
thought
so
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
ordered
something
rather
special
for
dinner
,
with
a
bottle
of
*NL*
something
similarly
out
of
the
common
way
,
in
order
that
our
minds
might
*NL*
be
fortified
for
the
occasion
,
and
we
might
come
well
up
to
the
mark
.
*NL*
Dinner
over
,
we
produced
a
bundle
of
pens
,
a
copious
supply
of
ink
,
and
*NL*
a
goodly
show
of
writing
and
blotting
paper
.
For
there
was
something
*NL*
very
comfortable
in
having
plenty
of
stationery
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
then
take
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
write
across
the
top
of
it
,
in
a
*NL*
neat
hand
,
the
heading
,
``
Memorandum
of
Pip
's
debts
''
;
with
Barnard
's
Inn
*NL*
and
the
date
very
carefully
added
.
Herbert
would
also
take
a
sheet
of
*NL*
paper
,
and
write
across
it
with
similar
formalities
,
``
Memorandum
of
*NL*
Herbert
's
debts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Each
of
us
would
then
refer
to
a
confused
heap
of
papers
at
his
side
,
*NL*
which
had
been
thrown
into
drawers
,
worn
into
holes
in
pockets
,
half
*NL*
burnt
in
lighting
candles
,
stuck
for
weeks
into
the
looking-glass
,
and
*NL*
otherwise
damaged
.
The
sound
of
our
pens
going
refreshed
us
exceedingly
,
*NL*
insomuch
that
I
sometimes
found
it
difficult
to
distinguish
between
this
*NL*
edifying
business
proceeding
and
actually
paying
the
money
.
In
point
of
*NL*
meritorious
character
,
the
two
things
seemed
about
equal
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
written
a
little
while
,
I
would
ask
Herbert
how
he
got
on
?
*NL*
Herbert
probably
would
have
been
scratching
his
head
in
a
most
rueful
*NL*
manner
at
the
sight
of
his
accumulating
figures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
mounting
up
,
Handel
,
''
Herbert
would
say
;
``
upon
my
life
,
they
*NL*
are
mounting
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
firm
,
Herbert
,
''
I
would
retort
,
plying
my
own
pen
with
great
*NL*
assiduity
.
``
Look
the
thing
in
the
face
.
Look
into
your
affairs
.
Stare
*NL*
them
out
of
countenance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
would
,
Handel
,
only
they
are
staring
me
out
of
countenance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
my
determined
manner
would
have
its
effect
,
and
Herbert
would
*NL*
fall
to
work
again
.
After
a
time
he
would
give
up
once
more
,
on
the
plea
*NL*
that
he
had
not
got
Cobbs
's
bill
,
or
Lobbs
's
,
or
Nobbs
's
,
as
the
case
*NL*
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Herbert
,
estimate
;
estimate
it
in
round
numbers
,
and
put
it
*NL*
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fellow
of
resource
you
are
!
''
my
friend
would
reply
,
with
*NL*
admiration
.
``
Really
your
business
powers
are
very
remarkable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
so
too
.
I
established
with
myself
,
on
these
occasions
,
*NL*
the
reputation
of
a
first-rate
man
of
business
,
--
prompt
,
decisive
,
*NL*
energetic
,
clear
,
cool-headed
.
When
I
had
got
all
my
responsibilities
*NL*
down
upon
my
list
,
I
compared
each
with
the
bill
,
and
ticked
it
off
.
My
*NL*
self-approval
when
I
ticked
an
entry
was
quite
a
luxurious
sensation
.
*NL*
When
I
had
no
more
ticks
to
make
,
I
folded
all
my
bills
up
uniformly
,
*NL*
docketed
each
on
the
back
,
and
tied
the
whole
into
a
symmetrical
*NL*
bundle
.
Then
I
did
the
same
for
Herbert
-LRB-
who
modestly
said
he
had
not
my
*NL*
administrative
genius
-RRB-
,
and
felt
that
I
had
brought
his
affairs
into
a
*NL*
focus
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
business
habits
had
one
other
bright
feature
,
which
I
called
``
leaving
*NL*
a
Margin
.
''
For
example
;
supposing
Herbert
's
debts
to
be
one
hundred
and
*NL*
sixty-four
pounds
four-and-twopence
,
I
would
say
,
``
Leave
a
margin
,
and
*NL*
put
them
down
at
two
hundred
.
''
Or
,
supposing
my
own
to
be
four
times
as
*NL*
much
,
I
would
leave
a
margin
,
and
put
them
down
at
seven
hundred
.
I
had
*NL*
the
highest
opinion
of
the
wisdom
of
this
same
Margin
,
but
I
am
bound
*NL*
to
acknowledge
that
on
looking
back
,
I
deem
it
to
have
been
an
expensive
*NL*
device
.
For
,
we
always
ran
into
new
debt
immediately
,
to
the
full
extent
*NL*
of
the
margin
,
and
sometimes
,
in
the
sense
of
freedom
and
solvency
it
*NL*
imparted
,
got
pretty
far
on
into
another
margin
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
a
calm
,
a
rest
,
a
virtuous
hush
,
consequent
on
these
*NL*
examinations
of
our
affairs
that
gave
me
,
for
the
time
,
an
admirable
*NL*
opinion
of
myself
.
Soothed
by
my
exertions
,
my
method
,
and
Herbert
's
*NL*
compliments
,
I
would
sit
with
his
symmetrical
bundle
and
my
own
on
the
*NL*
table
before
me
among
the
stationary
,
and
feel
like
a
Bank
of
some
sort
,
*NL*
rather
than
a
private
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shut
our
outer
door
on
these
solemn
occasions
,
in
order
that
we
might
*NL*
not
be
interrupted
.
I
had
fallen
into
my
serene
state
one
evening
,
when
*NL*
we
heard
a
letter
dropped
through
the
slit
in
the
said
door
,
and
fall
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
``
It
's
for
you
,
Handel
,
''
said
Herbert
,
going
out
and
coming
*NL*
back
with
it
,
``
and
I
hope
there
is
nothing
the
matter
.
''
This
was
in
*NL*
allusion
to
its
heavy
black
seal
and
border
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
signed
Trabb
&
Co.
,
and
its
contents
were
simply
,
that
*NL*
I
was
an
honored
sir
,
and
that
they
begged
to
inform
me
that
Mrs.
J.
*NL*
Gargery
had
departed
this
life
on
Monday
last
at
twenty
minutes
past
six
*NL*
in
the
evening
,
and
that
my
attendance
was
requested
at
the
interment
on
*NL*
Monday
next
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.

Chapter
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
that
a
grave
had
opened
in
my
road
of
life
,
and
*NL*
the
gap
it
made
in
the
smooth
ground
was
wonderful
.
The
figure
of
my
*NL*
sister
in
her
chair
by
the
kitchen
fire
,
haunted
me
night
and
day
.
That
*NL*
the
place
could
possibly
be
,
without
her
,
was
something
my
mind
seemed
*NL*
unable
to
compass
;
and
whereas
she
had
seldom
or
never
been
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
of
late
,
I
had
now
the
strangest
ideas
that
she
was
coming
*NL*
towards
me
in
the
street
,
or
that
she
would
presently
knock
at
the
door
.
*NL*
In
my
rooms
too
,
with
which
she
had
never
been
at
all
associated
,
there
*NL*
was
at
once
the
blankness
of
death
and
a
perpetual
suggestion
of
the
*NL*
sound
of
her
voice
or
the
turn
of
her
face
or
figure
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
still
alive
and
had
been
often
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
my
fortunes
might
have
been
,
I
could
scarcely
have
recalled
my
*NL*
sister
with
much
tenderness
.
But
I
suppose
there
is
a
shock
of
regret
*NL*
which
may
exist
without
much
tenderness
.
Under
its
influence
-LRB-
and
*NL*
perhaps
to
make
up
for
the
want
of
the
softer
feeling
-RRB-
I
was
seized
with
*NL*
a
violent
indignation
against
the
assailant
from
whom
she
had
suffered
*NL*
so
much
;
and
I
felt
that
on
sufficient
proof
I
could
have
revengefully
*NL*
pursued
Orlick
,
or
any
one
else
,
to
the
last
extremity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
written
to
Joe
,
to
offer
him
consolation
,
and
to
assure
him
*NL*
that
I
would
come
to
the
funeral
,
I
passed
the
intermediate
days
in
*NL*
the
curious
state
of
mind
I
have
glanced
at
.
I
went
down
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
alighted
at
the
Blue
Boar
in
good
time
to
walk
over
to
the
*NL*
forge
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fine
summer
weather
again
,
and
,
as
I
walked
along
,
the
times
*NL*
when
I
was
a
little
helpless
creature
,
and
my
sister
did
not
spare
me
,
*NL*
vividly
returned
.
But
they
returned
with
a
gentle
tone
upon
them
that
*NL*
softened
even
the
edge
of
Tickler
.
For
now
,
the
very
breath
of
the
beans
*NL*
and
clover
whispered
to
my
heart
that
the
day
must
come
when
it
would
*NL*
be
well
for
my
memory
that
others
walking
in
the
sunshine
should
be
*NL*
softened
as
they
thought
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
I
came
within
sight
of
the
house
,
and
saw
that
Trabb
and
Co.
had
*NL*
put
in
a
funereal
execution
and
taken
possession
.
Two
dismally
absurd
*NL*
persons
,
each
ostentatiously
exhibiting
a
crutch
done
up
in
a
black
*NL*
bandage
,
--
as
if
that
instrument
could
possibly
communicate
any
comfort
*NL*
to
anybody
,
--
were
posted
at
the
front
door
;
and
in
one
of
them
I
*NL*
recognized
a
postboy
discharged
from
the
Boar
for
turning
a
young
couple
*NL*
into
a
sawpit
on
their
bridal
morning
,
in
consequence
of
intoxication
*NL*
rendering
it
necessary
for
him
to
ride
his
horse
clasped
round
the
neck
*NL*
with
both
arms
.
All
the
children
of
the
village
,
and
most
of
the
women
,
*NL*
were
admiring
these
sable
warders
and
the
closed
windows
of
the
house
*NL*
and
forge
;
and
as
I
came
up
,
one
of
the
two
warders
-LRB-
the
postboy
-RRB-
*NL*
knocked
at
the
door
,
--
implying
that
I
was
far
too
much
exhausted
by
*NL*
grief
to
have
strength
remaining
to
knock
for
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
sable
warder
-LRB-
a
carpenter
,
who
had
once
eaten
two
geese
for
a
*NL*
wager
-RRB-
opened
the
door
,
and
showed
me
into
the
best
parlor
.
Here
,
Mr.
*NL*
Trabb
had
taken
unto
himself
the
best
table
,
and
had
got
all
the
leaves
*NL*
up
,
and
was
holding
a
kind
of
black
Bazaar
,
with
the
aid
of
a
quantity
*NL*
of
black
pins
.
At
the
moment
of
my
arrival
,
he
had
just
finished
putting
*NL*
somebody
's
hat
into
black
long-clothes
,
like
an
African
baby
;
so
he
held
*NL*
out
his
hand
for
mine
.
But
I
,
misled
by
the
action
,
and
confused
by
the
*NL*
occasion
,
shook
hands
with
him
with
every
testimony
of
warm
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
dear
Joe
,
entangled
in
a
little
black
cloak
tied
in
a
large
bow
*NL*
under
his
chin
,
was
seated
apart
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
;
where
,
*NL*
as
chief
mourner
,
he
had
evidently
been
stationed
by
Trabb
.
When
I
bent
*NL*
down
and
said
to
him
,
``
Dear
Joe
,
how
are
you
?
''
he
said
,
``
Pip
,
old
chap
,
*NL*
you
knowed
her
when
she
were
a
fine
figure
of
a
--
''
and
clasped
my
hand
*NL*
and
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
,
looking
very
neat
and
modest
in
her
black
dress
,
went
quietly
*NL*
here
and
there
,
and
was
very
helpful
.
When
I
had
spoken
to
Biddy
,
as
*NL*
I
thought
it
not
a
time
for
talking
I
went
and
sat
down
near
Joe
,
and
*NL*
there
began
to
wonder
in
what
part
of
the
house
it
--
she
--
my
sister
--
was
.
*NL*
The
air
of
the
parlor
being
faint
with
the
smell
of
sweet-cake
,
I
looked
*NL*
about
for
the
table
of
refreshments
;
it
was
scarcely
visible
until
one
*NL*
had
got
accustomed
to
the
gloom
,
but
there
was
a
cut-up
plum
cake
upon
*NL*
it
,
and
there
were
cut-up
oranges
,
and
sandwiches
,
and
biscuits
,
and
two
*NL*
decanters
that
I
knew
very
well
as
ornaments
,
but
had
never
seen
used
*NL*
in
all
my
life
;
one
full
of
port
,
and
one
of
sherry
.
Standing
at
this
*NL*
table
,
I
became
conscious
of
the
servile
Pumblechook
in
a
black
cloak
*NL*
and
several
yards
of
hatband
,
who
was
alternately
stuffing
himself
,
*NL*
and
making
obsequious
movements
to
catch
my
attention
.
The
moment
he
*NL*
succeeded
,
he
came
over
to
me
-LRB-
breathing
sherry
and
crumbs
-RRB-
,
and
said
*NL*
in
a
subdued
voice
,
``
May
I
,
dear
sir
?
''
and
did
.
I
then
descried
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Hubble
;
the
last-named
in
a
decent
speechless
paroxysm
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
We
were
all
going
to
``
follow
,
''
and
were
all
in
course
of
being
tied
up
*NL*
separately
-LRB-
by
Trabb
-RRB-
into
ridiculous
bundles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
I
meantersay
,
Pip
,
''
Joe
whispered
me
,
as
we
were
being
what
Mr.
*NL*
Trabb
called
``
formed
''
in
the
parlor
,
two
and
two
,
--
and
it
was
dreadfully
*NL*
like
a
preparation
for
some
grim
kind
of
dance
;
``
which
I
meantersay
,
*NL*
sir
,
as
I
would
in
preference
have
carried
her
to
the
church
myself
,
*NL*
along
with
three
or
four
friendly
ones
wot
come
to
it
with
willing
harts
*NL*
and
arms
,
but
it
were
considered
wot
the
neighbors
would
look
down
on
*NL*
such
and
would
be
of
opinions
as
it
were
wanting
in
respect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pocket-handkerchiefs
out
,
all
!
''
cried
Mr.
Trabb
at
this
point
,
in
a
*NL*
depressed
business-like
voice
.
``
Pocket-handkerchiefs
out
!
We
are
ready
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
all
put
our
pocket-handkerchiefs
to
our
faces
,
as
if
our
*NL*
noses
were
bleeding
,
and
filed
out
two
and
two
;
Joe
and
I
;
Biddy
and
*NL*
Pumblechook
;
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hubble
.
The
remains
of
my
poor
sister
had
been
*NL*
brought
round
by
the
kitchen
door
,
and
,
it
being
a
point
of
Undertaking
*NL*
ceremony
that
the
six
bearers
must
be
stifled
and
blinded
under
a
*NL*
horrible
black
velvet
housing
with
a
white
border
,
the
whole
looked
like
*NL*
a
blind
monster
with
twelve
human
legs
,
shuffling
and
blundering
along
,
*NL*
under
the
guidance
of
two
keepers
,
--
the
postboy
and
his
comrade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighborhood
,
however
,
highly
approved
of
these
arrangements
,
and
we
*NL*
were
much
admired
as
we
went
through
the
village
;
the
more
youthful
and
*NL*
vigorous
part
of
the
community
making
dashes
now
and
then
to
cut
us
off
,
*NL*
and
lying
in
wait
to
intercept
us
at
points
of
vantage
.
At
such
times
*NL*
the
more
exuberant
among
them
called
out
in
an
excited
manner
on
our
*NL*
emergence
round
some
corner
of
expectancy
,
``
Here
they
come
!
''
``
Here
they
*NL*
are
!
''
and
we
were
all
but
cheered
.
In
this
progress
I
was
much
annoyed
*NL*
by
the
abject
Pumblechook
,
who
,
being
behind
me
,
persisted
all
the
way
*NL*
as
a
delicate
attention
in
arranging
my
streaming
hatband
,
and
smoothing
*NL*
my
cloak
.
My
thoughts
were
further
distracted
by
the
excessive
pride
of
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hubble
,
who
were
surpassingly
conceited
and
vainglorious
in
*NL*
being
members
of
so
distinguished
a
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
range
of
marshes
lay
clear
before
us
,
with
the
sails
of
the
*NL*
ships
on
the
river
growing
out
of
it
;
and
we
went
into
the
churchyard
,
*NL*
close
to
the
graves
of
my
unknown
parents
,
Philip
Pirrip
,
late
of
this
*NL*
parish
,
and
Also
Georgiana
,
Wife
of
the
Above
.
And
there
,
my
sister
was
*NL*
laid
quietly
in
the
earth
,
while
the
larks
sang
high
above
it
,
and
the
*NL*
light
wind
strewed
it
with
beautiful
shadows
of
clouds
and
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
conduct
of
the
worldly
minded
Pumblechook
while
this
was
doing
,
*NL*
I
desire
to
say
no
more
than
it
was
all
addressed
to
me
;
and
that
even
*NL*
when
those
noble
passages
were
read
which
remind
humanity
how
it
brought
*NL*
nothing
into
the
world
and
can
take
nothing
out
,
and
how
it
fleeth
like
*NL*
a
shadow
and
never
continueth
long
in
one
stay
,
I
heard
him
cough
a
*NL*
reservation
of
the
case
of
a
young
gentleman
who
came
unexpectedly
into
*NL*
large
property
.
When
we
got
back
,
he
had
the
hardihood
to
tell
me
that
*NL*
he
wished
my
sister
could
have
known
I
had
done
her
so
much
honor
,
and
*NL*
to
hint
that
she
would
have
considered
it
reasonably
purchased
at
the
*NL*
price
of
her
death
.
After
that
,
he
drank
all
the
rest
of
the
sherry
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Hubble
drank
the
port
,
and
the
two
talked
-LRB-
which
I
have
since
*NL*
observed
to
be
customary
in
such
cases
-RRB-
as
if
they
were
of
quite
another
*NL*
race
from
the
deceased
,
and
were
notoriously
immortal
.
Finally
,
he
went
*NL*
away
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hubble
,
--
to
make
an
evening
of
it
,
I
felt
sure
,
*NL*
and
to
tell
the
Jolly
Bargemen
that
he
was
the
founder
of
my
fortunes
*NL*
and
my
earliest
benefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
all
gone
,
and
when
Trabb
and
his
men
--
but
not
his
Boy
;
I
*NL*
looked
for
him
--
had
crammed
their
mummery
into
bags
,
and
were
gone
too
,
*NL*
the
house
felt
wholesomer
.
Soon
afterwards
,
Biddy
,
Joe
,
and
I
,
had
a
*NL*
cold
dinner
together
;
but
we
dined
in
the
best
parlor
,
not
in
the
old
*NL*
kitchen
,
and
Joe
was
so
exceedingly
particular
what
he
did
with
his
*NL*
knife
and
fork
and
the
saltcellar
and
what
not
,
that
there
was
great
*NL*
restraint
upon
us
.
But
after
dinner
,
when
I
made
him
take
his
pipe
,
*NL*
and
when
I
had
loitered
with
him
about
the
forge
,
and
when
we
sat
down
*NL*
together
on
the
great
block
of
stone
outside
it
,
we
got
on
better
.
I
*NL*
noticed
that
after
the
funeral
Joe
changed
his
clothes
so
far
,
as
to
*NL*
make
a
compromise
between
his
Sunday
dress
and
working
dress
;
in
which
*NL*
the
dear
fellow
looked
natural
,
and
like
the
Man
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
much
pleased
by
my
asking
if
I
might
sleep
in
my
own
little
*NL*
room
,
and
I
was
pleased
too
;
for
I
felt
that
I
had
done
rather
a
great
*NL*
thing
in
making
the
request
.
When
the
shadows
of
evening
were
closing
*NL*
in
,
I
took
an
opportunity
of
getting
into
the
garden
with
Biddy
for
a
*NL*
little
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
think
you
might
have
written
to
me
about
these
sad
*NL*
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
,
Mr.
Pip
?
''
said
Biddy
.
``
I
should
have
written
if
I
had
thought
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
suppose
that
I
mean
to
be
unkind
,
Biddy
,
when
I
say
I
consider
*NL*
that
you
ought
to
have
thought
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
,
Mr.
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
quiet
,
and
had
such
an
orderly
,
good
,
and
pretty
way
with
*NL*
her
,
that
I
did
not
like
the
thought
of
making
her
cry
again
.
After
*NL*
looking
a
little
at
her
downcast
eyes
as
she
walked
beside
me
,
I
gave
up
*NL*
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
will
be
difficult
for
you
to
remain
here
now
,
Biddy
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
ca
n't
do
so
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
said
Biddy
,
in
a
tone
of
regret
but
still
*NL*
of
quiet
conviction
.
``
I
have
been
speaking
to
Mrs.
Hubble
,
and
I
am
*NL*
going
to
her
to-morrow
.
I
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
take
some
care
of
Mr.
*NL*
Gargery
,
together
,
until
he
settles
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
going
to
live
,
Biddy
?
If
you
want
any
mo
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
going
to
live
?
''
repeated
Biddy
,
striking
in
,
with
a
momentary
*NL*
flush
upon
her
face
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
Mr.
Pip
.
I
am
going
to
try
to
get
*NL*
the
place
of
mistress
in
the
new
school
nearly
finished
here
.
I
can
be
*NL*
well
recommended
by
all
the
neighbors
,
and
I
hope
I
can
be
industrious
*NL*
and
patient
,
and
teach
myself
while
I
teach
others
.
You
know
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
*NL*
pursued
Biddy
,
with
a
smile
,
as
she
raised
her
eyes
to
my
face
,
``
the
new
*NL*
schools
are
not
like
the
old
,
but
I
learnt
a
good
deal
from
you
after
*NL*
that
time
,
and
have
had
time
since
then
to
improve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
would
always
improve
,
Biddy
,
under
any
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Except
in
my
bad
side
of
human
nature
,
''
murmured
Biddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
so
much
a
reproach
as
an
irresistible
thinking
aloud
.
Well
!
*NL*
I
thought
I
would
give
up
that
point
too
.
So
,
I
walked
a
little
further
*NL*
with
Biddy
,
looking
silently
at
her
downcast
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
heard
the
particulars
of
my
sister
's
death
,
Biddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
very
slight
,
poor
thing
.
She
had
been
in
one
of
her
bad
*NL*
states
--
though
they
had
got
better
of
late
,
rather
than
worse
--
for
four
*NL*
days
,
when
she
came
out
of
it
in
the
evening
,
just
at
tea-time
,
and
said
*NL*
quite
plainly
,
`
Joe
.
'
As
she
had
never
said
any
word
for
a
long
while
,
I
*NL*
ran
and
fetched
in
Mr.
Gargery
from
the
forge
.
She
made
signs
to
me
that
*NL*
she
wanted
him
to
sit
down
close
to
her
,
and
wanted
me
to
put
her
arms
*NL*
round
his
neck
.
So
I
put
them
round
his
neck
,
and
she
laid
her
head
down
*NL*
on
his
shoulder
quite
content
and
satisfied
.
And
so
she
presently
said
*NL*
`
Joe
'
again
,
and
once
`
Pardon
,
'
and
once
`
Pip
.
'
And
so
she
never
lifted
*NL*
her
head
up
any
more
,
and
it
was
just
an
hour
later
when
we
laid
it
down
*NL*
on
her
own
bed
,
because
we
found
she
was
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
cried
;
the
darkening
garden
,
and
the
lane
,
and
the
stars
that
were
*NL*
coming
out
,
were
blurred
in
my
own
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
was
ever
discovered
,
Biddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
is
become
of
Orlick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
from
the
color
of
his
clothes
that
he
is
working
in
the
*NL*
quarries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
have
seen
him
then
?
--
Why
are
you
looking
at
that
dark
*NL*
tree
in
the
lane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
him
there
,
on
the
night
she
died
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
not
the
last
time
either
,
Biddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
have
seen
him
there
,
since
we
have
been
walking
here
.
--
It
is
of
*NL*
no
use
,
''
said
Biddy
,
laying
her
hand
upon
my
arm
,
as
I
was
for
running
*NL*
out
,
``
you
know
I
would
not
deceive
you
;
he
was
not
there
a
minute
,
and
*NL*
he
is
gone

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
revived
my
utmost
indignation
to
find
that
she
was
still
pursued
by
*NL*
this
fellow
,
and
I
felt
inveterate
against
him
.
I
told
her
so
,
and
told
*NL*
her
that
I
would
spend
any
money
or
take
any
pains
to
drive
him
out
of
*NL*
that
country
.
By
degrees
she
led
me
into
more
temperate
talk
,
and
she
*NL*
told
me
how
Joe
loved
me
,
and
how
Joe
never
complained
of
anything
,
--
she
*NL*
did
n't
say
,
of
me
;
she
had
no
need
;
I
knew
what
she
meant
,
--
but
ever
did
*NL*
his
duty
in
his
way
of
life
,
with
a
strong
hand
,
a
quiet
tongue
,
and
a
*NL*
gentle
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
it
would
be
hard
to
say
too
much
for
him
,
''
said
I
;
``
and
Biddy
,
*NL*
we
must
often
speak
of
these
things
,
for
of
course
I
shall
be
often
down
*NL*
here
now
.
I
am
not
going
to
leave
poor
Joe
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
said
never
a
single
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
do
n't
you
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mr.
Pip

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
mention
your
calling
me
Mr.
Pip
,
--
which
appears
to
me
to
be
in
*NL*
bad
taste
,
Biddy
,
--
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
mean
?
''
asked
Biddy
,
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
in
a
virtuously
self-asserting
manner
,
``
I
must
request
*NL*
to
know
what
you
mean
by
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
this
?
''
said
Biddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
n't
echo
,
''
I
retorted
.
``
You
used
not
to
echo
,
Biddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Used
not
!
''
said
Biddy
.
``
O
Mr.
Pip
!
Used
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
!
I
rather
thought
I
would
give
up
that
point
too
.
After
another
*NL*
silent
turn
in
the
garden
,
I
fell
back
on
the
main
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
made
a
remark
respecting
my
coming
down
here
often
,
*NL*
to
see
Joe
,
which
you
received
with
a
marked
silence
.
Have
the
goodness
,
*NL*
Biddy
,
to
tell
me
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
sure
,
then
,
that
you
WILL
come
to
see
him
often
?
''
asked
*NL*
Biddy
,
stopping
in
the
narrow
garden
walk
,
and
looking
at
me
under
the
*NL*
stars
with
a
clear
and
honest
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
dear
me
!
''
said
I
,
as
if
I
found
myself
compelled
to
give
up
Biddy
in
*NL*
despair
.
``
This
really
is
a
very
bad
side
of
human
nature
!
Do
n't
say
any
*NL*
more
,
if
you
please
,
Biddy
.
This
shocks
me
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
which
cogent
reason
I
kept
Biddy
at
a
distance
during
supper
,
and
*NL*
when
I
went
up
to
my
own
old
little
room
,
took
as
stately
a
leave
of
her
*NL*
as
I
could
,
in
my
murmuring
soul
,
deem
reconcilable
with
the
churchyard
*NL*
and
the
event
of
the
day
.
As
often
as
I
was
restless
in
the
night
,
and
*NL*
that
was
every
quarter
of
an
hour
,
I
reflected
what
an
unkindness
,
what
*NL*
an
injury
,
what
an
injustice
,
Biddy
had
done
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
I
was
to
go
.
Early
in
the
morning
I
was
out
,
and
*NL*
looking
in
,
unseen
,
at
one
of
the
wooden
windows
of
the
forge
.
There
*NL*
I
stood
,
for
minutes
,
looking
at
Joe
,
already
at
work
with
a
glow
of
*NL*
health
and
strength
upon
his
face
that
made
it
show
as
if
the
bright
sun
*NL*
of
the
life
in
store
for
him
were
shining
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
dear
Joe
!

No
,
do
n't
wipe
it
off

for
God
's
sake
,
give
me
your
*NL*
blackened
hand
!

I
shall
be
down
soon
and
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
too
soon
,
sir
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
and
never
too
often
,
Pip

''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
kitchen
door
,
with
a
mug
of
new
milk
and
*NL*
a
crust
of
bread
.
``
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
when
I
gave
her
my
hand
at
parting
,
*NL*
``
I
am
not
angry
,
but
I
am
hurt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
be
hurt
,
''
she
pleaded
quite
pathetically
;
``
let
only
me
be
*NL*
hurt
,
if
I
have
been
ungenerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
,
the
mists
were
rising
as
I
walked
away
.
If
they
disclosed
to
*NL*
me
,
as
I
suspect
they
did
,
that
I
should
not
come
back
,
and
that
Biddy
*NL*
was
quite
right
,
all
I
can
say
is
,

they
were
quite
right
too

Chapter
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
and
I
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
,
in
the
way
of
increasing
our
*NL*
debts
,
looking
into
our
affairs
,
leaving
Margins
,
and
the
like
exemplary
*NL*
transactions
;
and
Time
went
on
,
whether
or
no
,
as
he
has
a
way
of
doing
;
*NL*
and
I
came
of
age
,
--
in
fulfilment
of
Herbert
's
prediction
,
that
I
should
*NL*
do
so
before
I
knew
where
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
himself
had
come
of
age
eight
months
before
me
.
As
he
had
*NL*
nothing
else
than
his
majority
to
come
into
,
the
event
did
not
make
a
*NL*
profound
sensation
in
Barnard
's
Inn
.
But
we
had
looked
forward
to
*NL*
my
one-and-twentieth
birthday
,
with
a
crowd
of
speculations
and
*NL*
anticipations
,
for
we
had
both
considered
that
my
guardian
could
hardly
*NL*
help
saying
something
definite
on
that
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
taken
care
to
have
it
well
understood
in
Little
Britain
when
my
*NL*
birthday
was
.
On
the
day
before
it
,
I
received
an
official
note
from
*NL*
Wemmick
,
informing
me
that
Mr.
Jaggers
would
be
glad
if
I
would
call
*NL*
upon
him
at
five
in
the
afternoon
of
the
auspicious
day
.
This
convinced
*NL*
us
that
something
great
was
to
happen
,
and
threw
me
into
an
unusual
*NL*
flutter
when
I
repaired
to
my
guardian
's
office
,
a
model
of
punctuality
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
outer
office
Wemmick
offered
me
his
congratulations
,
and
*NL*
incidentally
rubbed
the
side
of
his
nose
with
a
folded
piece
of
*NL*
tissue-paper
that
I
liked
the
look
of
.
But
he
said
nothing
respecting
*NL*
it
,
and
motioned
me
with
a
nod
into
my
guardian
's
room
.
It
was
November
,
*NL*
and
my
guardian
was
standing
before
his
fire
leaning
his
back
against
*NL*
the
chimney-piece
,
with
his
hands
under
his
coattails
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Pip
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
must
call
you
Mr.
Pip
to-day
.
Congratulations
,
*NL*
Mr.
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
shook
hands
,
--
he
was
always
a
remarkably
short
shaker
,
--
and
I
thanked
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
chair

Pip

''
said
my
guardian
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
sat
down
,
and
he
preserved
his
attitude
and
bent
his
brows
at
his
*NL*
boots
,
I
felt
at
a
disadvantage
,
which
reminded
me
of
that
old
time
when
*NL*
I
had
been
put
upon
a
tombstone
.
The
two
ghastly
casts
on
the
shelf
*NL*
were
not
far
from
him
,
and
their
expression
was
as
if
they
were
making
a
*NL*
stupid
apoplectic
attempt
to
attend
to
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
my
young
friend
,
''
my
guardian
began
,
as
if
I
were
a
witness
in
the
*NL*
box
,
``
I
am
going
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
suppose
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
bending
forward
to
look
at
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
then
throwing
his
head
back
to
look
at
the
ceiling
,
--
``
what
*NL*
do
you
suppose
you
are
living
at
the
rate
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
rate
of
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
,
''
repeated
Mr.
Jaggers
,
still
looking
at
the
ceiling
,
*NL*
``
the
--
rate
--
of
?
''
And
then
looked
all
round
the
room
,
and
paused
with
his
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
in
his
hand
,
half-way
to
his
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
looked
into
my
affairs
so
often
,
that
I
had
thoroughly
destroyed
*NL*
any
slight
notion
I
might
ever
have
had
of
their
bearings
.
Reluctantly
,
*NL*
I
confessed
myself
quite
unable
to
answer
the
question
.
This
reply
*NL*
seemed
agreeable
to
Mr.
Jaggers
,
who
said
,
``
I
thought
so
!
''
and
blew
his
*NL*
nose
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
have
asked
you
a
question
,
my
friend
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
Have
*NL*
you
anything
to
ask
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
would
be
a
great
relief
to
me
to
ask
you
several
*NL*
questions
,
sir
;
but
I
remember
your
prohibition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
one
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
my
benefactor
to
be
made
known
to
me
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Ask
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
confidence
to
be
imparted
to
me
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waive
that
,
a
moment
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
and
ask
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
about
me
,
but
there
appeared
to
be
now
no
possible
escape
from
*NL*
the
inquiry
,
``
Have-I
--
anything
to
receive
,
sir
?
''
On
that
,
Mr.
Jaggers
*NL*
said
,
triumphantly
,
``
I
thought
we
should
come
to
it
!
''
and
called
to
*NL*
Wemmick
to
give
him
that
piece
of
paper
.
Wemmick
appeared
,
handed
it
in
,
*NL*
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
attend
,
if
you
please
.
You
have
been
*NL*
drawing
pretty
freely
here
;
your
name
occurs
pretty
often
in
Wemmick
's
*NL*
cash-book
;
but
you
are
in
debt
,
of
course
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
must
say
yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know

said
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
ask
you
what
you

because
you

and
if
you

know

you
would
n't
tell
me
;
you
would
say
less
.
Yes

yes

my
friend

''
*NL*
cried
Mr.
Jaggers
,
waving
his
forefinger
to
stop
me
as
I
made
a
show
*NL*
of
protesting
:
``
it
's
likely
enough
that
you
think
you
would
n't
,
but
*NL*
you
would

You
'll
excuse
me
,
but
I
know
better
than
you
.
Now
,
take
this
*NL*
piece
of
paper
in
your
hand
.
You
have
got
it
?
Very
good
.
Now
,
unfold
it
*NL*
and
tell
me
what
it
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
bank-note
,
''
said
I
,
``
for
five
hundred
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
bank-note
,
''
repeated
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
for
five
hundred
pounds
.
*NL*
And
a
very
handsome
sum
of
money
too
,
I
think
.
You
consider
it
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
do
otherwise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
But
answer
the
question
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
consider
it
,
undoubtedly
,
a
handsome
sum
of
money

Now
,
that
*NL*
handsome
sum
of
money
,
Pip
,
is
your
own
.
It
is
a
present
to
you
on
this
*NL*
day
,
in
earnest
of
your
expectations
.
And
at
the
rate
of
that
handsome
*NL*
sum
of
money
per
annum
,
and
at
no
higher
rate
,
you
are
to
live
until
the
*NL*
donor
of
the
whole
appears
.
That
is
to
say
,
you
will
now
take
your
money
*NL*
affairs
entirely
into
your
own
hands
,
and
you
will
draw
from
Wemmick
*NL*
one
hundred

twenty-five
pounds
per
quarter
,
until
you
are
in
*NL*
communication
with
the
fountain-head

no
longer
with
the

As
I
have
told
you
before

I
am
the
mere
agent

I
execute
my
*NL*
instructions

and
I
am
paid
for
doing
so

I
think
them
injudicious
,
but
*NL*
I
am
not
paid
for
giving
any
opinion
on
their
merits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
beginning
to
express
my
gratitude
to
my
benefactor
for
the
great
*NL*
liberality
with
which
I
was
treated
,
when
Mr.
Jaggers
stopped
me
.
``
I
am
*NL*
not
paid
,
Pip
,
''
said
he
,
coolly
,
``
to
carry
your
words
to
any
one
;
''
and
*NL*
then
gathered
up
his
coat-tails
,
as
he
had
gathered
up
the
subject
,
and
*NL*
stood
frowning
at
his
boots
as
if
he
suspected
them
of
designs
against
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
,
I
hinted
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
question
just
now
,
Mr.
Jaggers
,
which
you
desired
me
to
*NL*
waive
for
a
moment
.
I
hope
I
am
doing
nothing
wrong
in
asking
it
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
might
have
known
that
he
would
never
help
me
out
;
but
it
took
me
aback
*NL*
to
have
to
shape
the
question
afresh
,
as
if
it
were
quite
new
.
``
Is
it
*NL*
likely
,
''
I
said
,
after
hesitating
,
``
that
my
patron
,
the
fountain-head
*NL*
you
have
spoken
of
,
Mr.
Jaggers
,
will
soon

''
there
I
delicately
*NL*
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
soon
what
?
''
asked
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
That
's
no
question
as
it
stands
,
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
soon
come
to
London
,
''
said
I
,
after
casting
about
for
a
precise
*NL*
form
of
words
,
``
or
summon
me
anywhere
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
here
,
''
replied
Mr.
Jaggers
,
fixing
me
for
the
first
time
with
*NL*
his
dark
deep-set
eyes
,
``
we
must
revert
to
the
evening
when
we
first
*NL*
encountered
one
another
in
your
village
.
What
did
I
tell
you
then
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
me
,
Mr.
Jaggers
,
that
it
might
be
years
hence
when
that
person
*NL*
appeared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
that
's
my
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
looked
full
at
one
another
,
I
felt
my
breath
come
quicker
in
my
*NL*
strong
desire
to
get
something
out
of
him
.
And
as
I
felt
that
it
came
*NL*
quicker
,
and
as
I
felt
that
he
saw
that
it
came
quicker
,
I
felt
that
I
*NL*
had
less
chance
than
ever
of
getting
anything
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
it
will
still
be
years
hence
,
Mr.
Jaggers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
shook
his
head
,
--
not
in
negativing
the
question
,
but
in
*NL*
altogether
negativing
the
notion
that
he
could
anyhow
be
got
to
answer
*NL*
it
,
--
and
the
two
horrible
casts
of
the
twitched
faces
looked
,
when
*NL*
my
eyes
strayed
up
to
them
,
as
if
they
had
come
to
a
crisis
in
their
*NL*
suspended
attention
,
and
were
going
to
sneeze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
warming
the
backs
of
his
legs
with
the
backs
*NL*
of
his
warmed
hands
,
``
I
'll
be
plain
with
you
,
my
friend
Pip
.
That
's
a
*NL*
question
I
must
not
be
asked
.
You
'll
understand
that
better
,
when
I
tell
*NL*
you
it
's
a
question
that
might
compromise
me
.
Come
!
I
'll
go
a
little
*NL*
further
with
you
;
I
'll
say
something
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
down
so
low
to
frown
at
his
boots
,
that
he
was
able
to
rub
the
*NL*
calves
of
his
legs
in
the
pause
he
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
that
person
discloses
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
straightening
himself
,
*NL*
``
you
and
that
person
will
settle
your
own
affairs
.
When
that
person
*NL*
discloses
,
my
part
in
this
business
will
cease
and
determine
.
When
that
*NL*
person
discloses
,
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
know
anything
about
*NL*
it
.
And
that
's
all
I
have
got
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
at
one
another
until
I
withdrew
my
eyes
,
and
looked
*NL*
thoughtfully
at
the
floor
.
From
this
last
speech
I
derived
the
notion
*NL*
that
Miss
Havisham
,
for
some
reason
or
no
reason
,
had
not
taken
him
*NL*
into
her
confidence
as
to
her
designing
me
for
Estella
;
that
he
resented
*NL*
this
,
and
felt
a
jealousy
about
it
;
or
that
he
really
did
object
to
*NL*
that
scheme
,
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
When
I
raised
my
eyes
*NL*
again
,
I
found
that
he
had
been
shrewdly
looking
at
me
all
the
time
,
and
*NL*
was
doing
so
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
all
you
have
to
say
,
sir
,
''
I
remarked
,
``
there
can
be
nothing
*NL*
left
for
me
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
assent
,
and
pulled
out
his
thief-dreaded
watch
,
and
asked
me
*NL*
where
I
was
going
to
dine
?
I
replied
at
my
own
chambers
,
with
Herbert
.
*NL*
As
a
necessary
sequence
,
I
asked
him
if
he
would
favor
us
with
his
*NL*
company
,
and
he
promptly
accepted
the
invitation
.
But
he
insisted
on
*NL*
walking
home
with
me
,
in
order
that
I
might
make
no
extra
preparation
*NL*
for
him
,
and
first
he
had
a
letter
or
two
to
write
,
and
-LRB-
of
course
-RRB-
had
*NL*
his
hands
to
wash
.
So
I
said
I
would
go
into
the
outer
office
and
talk
*NL*
to
Wemmick
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
,
that
when
the
five
hundred
pounds
had
come
into
my
pocket
,
*NL*
a
thought
had
come
into
my
head
which
had
been
often
there
before
;
*NL*
and
it
appeared
to
me
that
Wemmick
was
a
good
person
to
advise
with
*NL*
concerning
such
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
already
locked
up
his
safe
,
and
made
preparations
for
going
home
.
*NL*
He
had
left
his
desk
,
brought
out
his
two
greasy
office
candlesticks
and
*NL*
stood
them
in
line
with
the
snuffers
on
a
slab
near
the
door
,
ready
to
*NL*
be
extinguished
;
he
had
raked
his
fire
low
,
put
his
hat
and
great-coat
*NL*
ready
,
and
was
beating
himself
all
over
the
chest
with
his
safe-key
,
as
*NL*
an
athletic
exercise
after
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Wemmick
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
want
to
ask
your
opinion
.
I
am
very
desirous
*NL*
to
serve
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
tightened
his
post-office
and
shook
his
head
,
as
if
his
opinion
*NL*
were
dead
against
any
fatal
weakness
of
that
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
friend
,
''
I
pursued
,
``
is
trying
to
get
on
in
commercial
life
,
*NL*
but
has
no
money
,
and
finds
it
difficult
and
disheartening
to
make
a
*NL*
beginning
.
Now
I
want
somehow
to
help
him
to
a
beginning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
money
down
?
''
said
Wemmick
,
in
a
tone
drier
than
any
sawdust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
some
money
down
,
''
I
replied
,
for
an
uneasy
remembrance
shot
across
*NL*
me
of
that
symmetrical
bundle
of
papers
at
home
--
``
with
some
money
down
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
some
anticipation
of
my
expectations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Pip
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
I
should
like
just
to
run
over
with
you
on
my
*NL*
fingers
,
if
you
please
,
the
names
of
the
various
bridges
up
as
high
*NL*
as
Chelsea
Reach
.
Let
's
see
;
there
's
London
,
one
;
Southwark
,
two
;
*NL*
Blackfriars
,
three
;
Waterloo
,
four
;
Westminster
,
five
;
Vauxhall
,
six
.
''
*NL*
He
had
checked
off
each
bridge
in
its
turn
,
with
the
handle
of
his
*NL*
safe-key
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
``
There
's
as
many
as
six

you
see
,
to
*NL*
choose
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Choose
your
bridge

Mr.
Pip

returned
Wemmick
,
``
and
take
a
walk
upon
*NL*
your
bridge

and
pitch
your
money
into
the
Thames
over
the
centre
arch

of
your
bridge

and
you
know
the
end

it

you
may
know
the
end

but
it
's
a
less
pleasant

profitable

*NL*
*NL*
I
could
have
posted
a
newspaper
in
his
mouth
,
he
made
it
so
wide
after
*NL*
saying
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
very
discouraging
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meant
to
be
so
,
''
said
Wemmick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
is
it
your
opinion
,
''
I
inquired
,
with
some
little
indignation
,
*NL*
``
that
a
man
should
never
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Invest
portable
property
in
a
friend
?
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
Certainly
*NL*
he
should
not
.
Unless
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
friend
,
--
and
then
it
*NL*
becomes
a
question
how
much
portable
property
it
may
be
worth
to
get
rid
*NL*
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
,
''
said
I
,
``
is
your
deliberate
opinion
,
Mr.
Wemmick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
he
returned
,
``
is
my
deliberate
opinion
in
this
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
I
,
pressing
him
,
for
I
thought
I
saw
him
near
a
loophole
*NL*
here
;
``
but
would
that
be
your
opinion
at
Walworth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Pip
,
''
he
replied
,
with
gravity
,
``
Walworth
is
one
place
,
and
this
*NL*
office
is
another
.
Much
as
the
Aged
is
one
person
,
and
Mr.
Jaggers
is
*NL*
another
.
They
must
not
be
confounded
together
.
My
Walworth
sentiments
*NL*
must
be
taken
at
Walworth
;
none
but
my
official
sentiments
can
be
taken
*NL*
in
this
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
I
,
much
relieved
,
``
then
I
shall
look
you
up
at
*NL*
Walworth
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Pip
,
''
he
returned
,
``
you
will
be
welcome
there
,
in
a
private
and
*NL*
personal
capacity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
held
this
conversation
in
a
low
voice
,
well
knowing
my
guardian
's
*NL*
ears
to
be
the
sharpest
of
the
sharp
.
As
he
now
appeared
in
his
doorway
,
*NL*
towelling
his
hands
,
Wemmick
got
on
his
great-coat
and
stood
by
to
snuff
*NL*
out
the
candles
.
We
all
three
went
into
the
street
together
,
and
from
*NL*
the
door-step
Wemmick
turned
his
way
,
and
Mr.
Jaggers
and
I
turned
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
help
wishing
more
than
once
that
evening
,
that
Mr.
Jaggers
*NL*
had
had
an
Aged
in
Gerrard
Street
,
or
a
Stinger
,
or
a
Something
,
or
*NL*
a
Somebody
,
to
unbend
his
brows
a
little
.
It
was
an
uncomfortable
*NL*
consideration
on
a
twenty-first
birthday
,
that
coming
of
age
at
all
*NL*
seemed
hardly
worth
while
in
such
a
guarded
and
suspicious
world
as
he
*NL*
made
of
it
.
He
was
a
thousand
times
better
informed
and
cleverer
than
*NL*
Wemmick
,
and
yet
I
would
a
thousand
times
rather
have
had
Wemmick
to
*NL*
dinner
.
And
Mr.
Jaggers
made
not
me
alone
intensely
melancholy
,
because
,
*NL*
after
he
was
gone
,
Herbert
said
of
himself
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
*NL*
fire
,
that
he
thought
he
must
have
committed
a
felony
and
forgotten
the
*NL*
details
of
it
,
he
felt
so
dejected
and
guilty
.

Chapter
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
Deeming
Sunday
the
best
day
for
taking
Mr.
Wemmick
's
Walworth
*NL*
sentiments
,
I
devoted
the
next
ensuing
Sunday
afternoon
to
a
pilgrimage
*NL*
to
the
Castle
.
On
arriving
before
the
battlements
,
I
found
the
Union
*NL*
Jack
flying
and
the
drawbridge
up
;
but
undeterred
by
this
show
of
*NL*
defiance
and
resistance
,
I
rang
at
the
gate
,
and
was
admitted
in
a
most
*NL*
pacific
manner
by
the
Aged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
,
sir
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
after
securing
the
drawbridge
,
``
rather
*NL*
had
it
in
his
mind
that
you
might
happen
to
drop
in
,
and
he
left
word
*NL*
that
he
would
soon
be
home
from
his
afternoon
's
walk
.
He
is
very
regular
*NL*
in
his
walks
,
is
my
son
.
Very
regular
in
everything
,
is
my
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
nodded
at
the
old
gentleman
as
Wemmick
himself
might
have
nodded
,
and
*NL*
we
went
in
and
sat
down
by
the
fireside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
made
acquaintance
with
my
son
,
sir
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
in
his
*NL*
chirping
way
,
while
he
warmed
his
hands
at
the
blaze
,
``
at
his
office
,
I
*NL*
expect
?
''
I
nodded
.
``
Hah
!
I
have
heerd
that
my
son
is
a
wonderful
hand
at
*NL*
his
business
,
sir
?
''
I
nodded
hard
.
``
Yes
;
so
they
tell
me
.
His
business
*NL*
is
the
Law
?
''
I
nodded
harder
.
``
Which
makes
it
more
surprising
in
my
*NL*
son
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
for
he
was
not
brought
up
to
the
Law
,
but
to
*NL*
the
Wine-Coopering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Curious
to
know
how
the
old
gentleman
stood
informed
concerning
the
*NL*
reputation
of
Mr.
Jaggers
,
I
roared
that
name
at
him
.
He
threw
me
into
*NL*
the
greatest
confusion
by
laughing
heartily
and
replying
in
a
very
*NL*
sprightly
manner
,
``
No
,
to
be
sure
;
you
're
right
.
''
And
to
this
hour
I
*NL*
have
not
the
faintest
notion
what
he
meant
,
or
what
joke
he
thought
I
*NL*
had
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
could
not
sit
there
nodding
at
him
perpetually
,
without
making
*NL*
some
other
attempt
to
interest
him
,
I
shouted
at
inquiry
whether
his
own
*NL*
calling
in
life
had
been
``
the
Wine-Coopering
.
''
By
dint
of
straining
that
*NL*
term
out
of
myself
several
times
and
tapping
the
old
gentleman
on
the
*NL*
chest
to
associate
it
with
him
,
I
at
last
succeeded
in
making
my
meaning
*NL*
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
;
``
the
warehousing
,
the
warehousing
.
First
,
*NL*
over
yonder
;
''
he
appeared
to
mean
up
the
chimney
,
but
I
believe
he
*NL*
intended
to
refer
me
to
Liverpool
;
``
and
then
in
the
City
of
London
here
.
*NL*
However
,
having
an
infirmity
--
for
I
am
hard
of
hearing
,
sir
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
expressed
in
pantomime
the
greatest
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Yes
,
hard
of
hearing
;
having
that
infirmity
coming
upon
me
,
my
son
he
*NL*
went
into
the
Law
,
and
he
took
charge
of
me
,
and
he
by
little
and
little
*NL*
made
out
this
elegant
and
beautiful
property
.
But
returning
to
what
you
*NL*
said
,
you
know
,
''
pursued
the
old
man
,
again
laughing
heartily
,
``
what
I
*NL*
say
is
,
No
to
be
sure
;
you
're
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
modestly
wondering
whether
my
utmost
ingenuity
would
have
enabled
*NL*
me
to
say
anything
that
would
have
amused
him
half
as
much
as
this
*NL*
imaginary
pleasantry
,
when
I
was
startled
by
a
sudden
click
in
the
wall
*NL*
on
one
side
of
the
chimney
,
and
the
ghostly
tumbling
open
of
a
little
*NL*
wooden
flap
with
``
JOHN
''
upon
it
.
The
old
man
,
following
my
eyes
,
cried
*NL*
with
great
triumph
,
``
My
son
's
come
home
!
''
and
we
both
went
out
to
the
*NL*
drawbridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
worth
any
money
to
see
Wemmick
waving
a
salute
to
me
from
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
moat
,
when
we
might
have
shaken
hands
across
it
with
*NL*
the
greatest
ease
.
The
Aged
was
so
delighted
to
work
the
drawbridge
,
*NL*
that
I
made
no
offer
to
assist
him
,
but
stood
quiet
until
Wemmick
had
*NL*
come
across
,
and
had
presented
me
to
Miss
Skiffins
;
a
lady
by
whom
he
*NL*
was
accompanied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Skiffins
was
of
a
wooden
appearance
,
and
was
,
like
her
escort
,
in
*NL*
the
post-office
branch
of
the
service
.
She
might
have
been
some
two
or
*NL*
three
years
younger
than
Wemmick
,
and
I
judged
her
to
stand
possessed
*NL*
of
portable
property
.
The
cut
of
her
dress
from
the
waist
upward
,
both
*NL*
before
and
behind
,
made
her
figure
very
like
a
boy
's
kite
;
and
I
might
*NL*
have
pronounced
her
gown
a
little
too
decidedly
orange
,
and
her
gloves
a
*NL*
little
too
intensely
green
.
But
she
seemed
to
be
a
good
sort
of
fellow
,
*NL*
and
showed
a
high
regard
for
the
Aged
.
I
was
not
long
in
discovering
*NL*
that
she
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
Castle
;
for
,
on
our
going
in
,
*NL*
and
my
complimenting
Wemmick
on
his
ingenious
contrivance
for
announcing
*NL*
himself
to
the
Aged
,
he
begged
me
to
give
my
attention
for
a
moment
to
*NL*
the
other
side
of
the
chimney
,
and
disappeared
.
Presently
another
click
*NL*
came
,
and
another
little
door
tumbled
open
with
``
Miss
Skiffins
''
on
it
;
*NL*
then
Miss
Skiffins
shut
up
and
John
tumbled
open
;
then
Miss
Skiffins
*NL*
and
John
both
tumbled
open
together
,
and
finally
shut
up
together
.
On
*NL*
Wemmick
's
return
from
working
these
mechanical
appliances
,
I
expressed
*NL*
the
great
admiration
with
which
I
regarded
them
,
and
he
said
,
``
Well
,
you
*NL*
know
,
they
're
both
pleasant
and
useful
to
the
Aged
.
And
by
George
,
sir
,
*NL*
it
's
a
thing
worth
mentioning
,
that
of
all
the
people
who
come
to
*NL*
this
gate
,
the
secret
of
those
pulls
is
only
known
to
the
Aged
,
Miss
*NL*
Skiffins
,
and
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mr.
Wemmick
made
them
,
''
added
Miss
Skiffins
,
``
with
his
own
hands
*NL*
out
of
his
own
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Miss
Skiffins
was
taking
off
her
bonnet
-LRB-
she
retained
her
green
*NL*
gloves
during
the
evening
as
an
outward
and
visible
sign
that
there
was
*NL*
company
-RRB-
,
Wemmick
invited
me
to
take
a
walk
with
him
round
the
property
,
*NL*
and
see
how
the
island
looked
in
wintertime
.
Thinking
that
he
did
this
*NL*
to
give
me
an
opportunity
of
taking
his
Walworth
sentiments
,
I
seized
*NL*
the
opportunity
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
the
Castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thought
of
the
matter
with
care
,
I
approached
my
subject
as
if
I
*NL*
had
never
hinted
at
it
before
.
I
informed
Wemmick
that
I
was
anxious
in
*NL*
behalf
of
Herbert
Pocket
,
and
I
told
him
how
we
had
first
met
,
and
how
*NL*
we
had
fought
.
I
glanced
at
Herbert
's
home
,
and
at
his
character
,
and
*NL*
at
his
having
no
means
but
such
as
he
was
dependent
on
his
father
for
;
*NL*
those
,
uncertain
and
unpunctual
.
I
alluded
to
the
advantages
I
had
*NL*
derived
in
my
first
rawness
and
ignorance
from
his
society
,
and
I
*NL*
confessed
that
I
feared
I
had
but
ill
repaid
them
,
and
that
he
might
*NL*
have
done
better
without
me
and
my
expectations
.
Keeping
Miss
Havisham
*NL*
in
the
background
at
a
great
distance
,
I
still
hinted
at
the
possibility
*NL*
of
my
having
competed
with
him
in
his
prospects
,
and
at
the
certainty
of
*NL*
his
possessing
a
generous
soul
,
and
being
far
above
any
mean
distrusts
,
*NL*
retaliations
,
or
designs
.
For
all
these
reasons
-LRB-
I
told
Wemmick
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
because
he
was
my
young
companion
and
friend
,
and
I
had
a
great
*NL*
affection
for
him
,
I
wished
my
own
good
fortune
to
reflect
some
rays
*NL*
upon
him
,
and
therefore
I
sought
advice
from
Wemmick
's
experience
and
*NL*
knowledge
of
men
and
affairs
,
how
I
could
best
try
with
my
resources
to
*NL*
help
Herbert
to
some
present
income
,
--
say
of
a
hundred
a
year
,
to
keep
*NL*
him
in
good
hope
and
heart
,
--
and
gradually
to
buy
him
on
to
some
small
*NL*
partnership
.
I
begged
Wemmick
,
in
conclusion
,
to
understand
that
my
help
*NL*
must
always
be
rendered
without
Herbert
's
knowledge
or
suspicion
,
and
*NL*
that
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
world
with
whom
I
could
advise
.
I
*NL*
wound
up
by
laying
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
saying
,
``
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
confiding
in
you
,
though
I
know
it
must
be
troublesome
to
you
;
but
that
*NL*
is
your
fault
,
in
having
ever
brought
me
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
was
silent
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
with
a
kind
of
*NL*
start
,
``
Well
you
know
,
Mr.
Pip
,
I
must
tell
you
one
thing
.
This
is
*NL*
devilish
good
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
you
'll
help
me
to
be
good
then
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ecod
,
''
replied
Wemmick
,
shaking
his
head
,
``
that
's
not
my
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
is
this
your
trading-place
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
he
returned
.
``
You
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
Mr.
Pip
,
*NL*
I
'll
put
on
my
considering-cap
,
and
I
think
all
you
want
to
do
may
be
*NL*
done
by
degrees
.
Skiffins
-LRB-
that
's
her
brother
-RRB-
is
an
accountant
and
*NL*
agent
.
I
'll
look
him
up
and
go
to
work
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
ten
thousand
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
thank
you
,
for
though
we
are
strictly
in
*NL*
our
private
and
personal
capacity
,
still
it
may
be
mentioned
that
there
*NL*
are
Newgate
cobwebs
about
,
and
it
brushes
them
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
further
conversation
to
the
same
effect
,
we
returned
into
*NL*
the
Castle
where
we
found
Miss
Skiffins
preparing
tea
.
The
responsible
*NL*
duty
of
making
the
toast
was
delegated
to
the
Aged
,
and
that
excellent
*NL*
old
gentleman
was
so
intent
upon
it
that
he
seemed
to
me
in
some
danger
*NL*
of
melting
his
eyes
.
It
was
no
nominal
meal
that
we
were
going
to
make
,
*NL*
but
a
vigorous
reality
.
The
Aged
prepared
such
a
hay-stack
of
buttered
*NL*
toast
,
that
I
could
scarcely
see
him
over
it
as
it
simmered
on
an
iron
*NL*
stand
hooked
on
to
the
top-bar
;
while
Miss
Skiffins
brewed
such
a
jorum
*NL*
of
tea
,
that
the
pig
in
the
back
premises
became
strongly
excited
,
and
*NL*
repeatedly
expressed
his
desire
to
participate
in
the
entertainment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flag
had
been
struck
,
and
the
gun
had
been
fired
,
at
the
right
*NL*
moment
of
time
,
and
I
felt
as
snugly
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
Walworth
*NL*
as
if
the
moat
were
thirty
feet
wide
by
as
many
deep
.
Nothing
disturbed
*NL*
the
tranquillity
of
the
Castle
,
but
the
occasional
tumbling
open
of
*NL*
John
and
Miss
Skiffins
:
which
little
doors
were
a
prey
to
some
spasmodic
*NL*
infirmity
that
made
me
sympathetically
uncomfortable
until
I
got
used
*NL*
to
it
.
I
inferred
from
the
methodical
nature
of
Miss
Skiffins
's
*NL*
arrangements
that
she
made
tea
there
every
Sunday
night
;
and
I
rather
*NL*
suspected
that
a
classic
brooch
she
wore
,
representing
the
profile
of
an
*NL*
undesirable
female
with
a
very
straight
nose
and
a
very
new
moon
,
was
a
*NL*
piece
of
portable
property
that
had
been
given
her
by
Wemmick
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
ate
the
whole
of
the
toast
,
and
drank
tea
in
proportion
,
and
it
was
*NL*
delightful
to
see
how
warm
and
greasy
we
all
got
after
it
.
The
Aged
*NL*
especially
,
might
have
passed
for
some
clean
old
chief
of
a
savage
*NL*
tribe
,
just
oiled
.
After
a
short
pause
of
repose
,
Miss
Skiffins
--
in
the
*NL*
absence
of
the
little
servant
who
,
it
seemed
,
retired
to
the
bosom
of
*NL*
her
family
on
Sunday
afternoons
--
washed
up
the
tea-things
,
in
a
trifling
*NL*
lady-like
amateur
manner
that
compromised
none
of
us
.
Then
,
she
put
on
*NL*
her
gloves
again
,
and
we
drew
round
the
fire
,
and
Wemmick
said
,
``
Now
,
*NL*
Aged
Parent
,
tip
us
the
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
explained
to
me
while
the
Aged
got
his
spectacles
out
,
that
this
*NL*
was
according
to
custom
,
and
that
it
gave
the
old
gentleman
infinite
*NL*
satisfaction
to
read
the
news
aloud
.
``
I
wo
n't
offer
an
apology
,
''
said
*NL*
Wemmick
,
``
for
he
is
n't
capable
of
many
pleasures
--
are
you
,
Aged
P.
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
John
,
all
right
,
''
returned
the
old
man
,
seeing
himself
*NL*
spoken
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
tip
him
a
nod
every
now
and
then
when
he
looks
off
his
paper
,
''
*NL*
said
Wemmick
,
``
and
he
'll
be
as
happy
as
a
king
.
We
are
all
attention
,
*NL*
Aged
One
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
John
,
all
right
!
''
returned
the
cheerful
old
man
,
so
busy
and
*NL*
so
pleased
,
that
it
really
was
quite
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Aged
's
reading
reminded
me
of
the
classes
at
Mr.
Wopsle
's
*NL*
great-aunt
's
,
with
the
pleasanter
peculiarity
that
it
seemed
to
come
*NL*
through
a
keyhole
.
As
he
wanted
the
candles
close
to
him
,
and
as
he
was
*NL*
always
on
the
verge
of
putting
either
his
head
or
the
newspaper
into
*NL*
them
,
he
required
as
much
watching
as
a
powder-mill
.
But
Wemmick
was
*NL*
equally
untiring
and
gentle
in
his
vigilance
,
and
the
Aged
read
on
,
*NL*
quite
unconscious
of
his
many
rescues
.
Whenever
he
looked
at
us
,
we
*NL*
all
expressed
the
greatest
interest
and
amazement
,
and
nodded
until
he
*NL*
resumed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Wemmick
and
Miss
Skiffins
sat
side
by
side
,
and
as
I
sat
in
a
shadowy
*NL*
corner
,
I
observed
a
slow
and
gradual
elongation
of
Mr.
Wemmick
's
mouth
,
*NL*
powerfully
suggestive
of
his
slowly
and
gradually
stealing
his
arm
round
*NL*
Miss
Skiffins
's
waist
.
In
course
of
time
I
saw
his
hand
appear
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
Miss
Skiffins
;
but
at
that
moment
Miss
Skiffins
neatly
*NL*
stopped
him
with
the
green
glove
,
unwound
his
arm
again
as
if
it
were
*NL*
an
article
of
dress
,
and
with
the
greatest
deliberation
laid
it
on
the
*NL*
table
before
her
.
Miss
Skiffins
's
composure
while
she
did
this
was
one
*NL*
of
the
most
remarkable
sights
I
have
ever
seen
,
and
if
I
could
have
*NL*
thought
the
act
consistent
with
abstraction
of
mind
,
I
should
have
*NL*
deemed
that
Miss
Skiffins
performed
it
mechanically
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
,
I
noticed
Wemmick
's
arm
beginning
to
disappear
again
,
and
*NL*
gradually
fading
out
of
view
.
Shortly
afterwards
,
his
mouth
began
to
*NL*
widen
again
.
After
an
interval
of
suspense
on
my
part
that
was
quite
*NL*
enthralling
and
almost
painful
,
I
saw
his
hand
appear
on
the
other
side
*NL*
of
Miss
Skiffins
.
Instantly
,
Miss
Skiffins
stopped
it
with
the
neatness
*NL*
of
a
placid
boxer
,
took
off
that
girdle
or
cestus
as
before
,
and
laid
*NL*
it
on
the
table
.
Taking
the
table
to
represent
the
path
of
virtue
,
I
am
*NL*
justified
in
stating
that
during
the
whole
time
of
the
Aged
's
reading
,
*NL*
Wemmick
's
arm
was
straying
from
the
path
of
virtue
and
being
recalled
to
*NL*
it
by
Miss
Skiffins
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
the
Aged
read
himself
into
a
light
slumber
.
This
was
the
time
*NL*
for
Wemmick
to
produce
a
little
kettle
,
a
tray
of
glasses
,
and
a
*NL*
black
bottle
with
a
porcelain-topped
cork
,
representing
some
clerical
*NL*
dignitary
of
a
rubicund
and
social
aspect
.
With
the
aid
of
these
*NL*
appliances
we
all
had
something
warm
to
drink
,
including
the
Aged
,
who
*NL*
was
soon
awake
again
.
Miss
Skiffins
mixed
,
and
I
observed
that
she
and
*NL*
Wemmick
drank
out
of
one
glass
.
Of
course
I
knew
better
than
to
offer
to
*NL*
see
Miss
Skiffins
home
,
and
under
the
circumstances
I
thought
I
had
best
*NL*
go
first
;
which
I
did
,
taking
a
cordial
leave
of
the
Aged
,
and
having
*NL*
passed
a
pleasant
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
a
week
was
out
,
I
received
a
note
from
Wemmick
,
dated
Walworth
,
*NL*
stating
that
he
hoped
he
had
made
some
advance
in
that
matter
*NL*
appertaining
to
our
private
and
personal
capacities
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
be
glad
if
I
could
come
and
see
him
again
upon
it
.
So
,
I
went
out
*NL*
to
Walworth
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
I
saw
him
by
*NL*
appointment
in
the
City
several
times
,
but
never
held
any
communication
*NL*
with
him
on
the
subject
in
or
near
Little
Britain
.
The
upshot
was
,
*NL*
that
we
found
a
worthy
young
merchant
or
shipping-broker
,
not
long
*NL*
established
in
business
,
who
wanted
intelligent
help
,
and
who
wanted
*NL*
capital
,
and
who
in
due
course
of
time
and
receipt
would
want
a
partner
.
*NL*
Between
him
and
me
,
secret
articles
were
signed
of
which
Herbert
was
the
*NL*
subject
,
and
I
paid
him
half
of
my
five
hundred
pounds
down
,
and
engaged
*NL*
for
sundry
other
payments
:
some
,
to
fall
due
at
certain
dates
out
of
my
*NL*
income
:
some
,
contingent
on
my
coming
into
my
property
.
Miss
Skiffins
's
*NL*
brother
conducted
the
negotiation
.
Wemmick
pervaded
it
throughout
,
but
*NL*
never
appeared
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
business
was
so
cleverly
managed
,
that
Herbert
had
not
the
*NL*
least
suspicion
of
my
hand
being
in
it
.
I
never
shall
forget
the
radiant
*NL*
face
with
which
he
came
home
one
afternoon
,
and
told
me
,
as
a
mighty
*NL*
piece
of
news
,
of
his
having
fallen
in
with
one
Clarriker
-LRB-
the
young
*NL*
merchant
's
name
-RRB-
,
and
of
Clarriker
's
having
shown
an
extraordinary
*NL*
inclination
towards
him
,
and
of
his
belief
that
the
opening
had
come
at
*NL*
last
.
Day
by
day
as
his
hopes
grew
stronger
and
his
face
brighter
,
he
*NL*
must
have
thought
me
a
more
and
more
affectionate
friend
,
for
I
had
the
*NL*
greatest
difficulty
in
restraining
my
tears
of
triumph
when
I
saw
him
so
*NL*
happy
.
At
length
,
the
thing
being
done
,
and
he
having
that
day
entered
*NL*
Clarriker
's
House
,
and
he
having
talked
to
me
for
a
whole
evening
in
a
*NL*
flush
of
pleasure
and
success
,
I
did
really
cry
in
good
earnest
when
*NL*
I
went
to
bed
,
to
think
that
my
expectations
had
done
some
good
to
*NL*
somebody
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
event
in
my
life
,
the
turning
point
of
my
life
,
now
opens
on
my
*NL*
view
.
But
,
before
I
proceed
to
narrate
it
,
and
before
I
pass
on
to
all
*NL*
the
changes
it
involved
,
I
must
give
one
chapter
to
Estella
.
It
is
not
*NL*
much
to
give
to
the
theme
that
so
long
filled
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
If
that
staid
old
house
near
the
Green
at
Richmond
should
ever
come
to
*NL*
be
haunted
when
I
am
dead
,
it
will
be
haunted
,
surely
,
by
my
ghost
.
O
*NL*
the
many
,
many
nights
and
days
through
which
the
unquiet
spirit
within
*NL*
me
haunted
that
house
when
Estella
lived
there
!
Let
my
body
be
where
it
*NL*
would
,
my
spirit
was
always
wandering
,
wandering
,
wandering
,
about
that
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
with
whom
Estella
was
placed
,
Mrs.
Brandley
by
name
,
was
a
*NL*
widow
,
with
one
daughter
several
years
older
than
Estella
.
The
mother
*NL*
looked
young
,
and
the
daughter
looked
old
;
the
mother
's
complexion
was
*NL*
pink
,
and
the
daughter
's
was
yellow
;
the
mother
set
up
for
frivolity
,
*NL*
and
the
daughter
for
theology
.
They
were
in
what
is
called
a
good
*NL*
position
,
and
visited
,
and
were
visited
by
,
numbers
of
people
.
Little
,
*NL*
if
any
,
community
of
feeling
subsisted
between
them
and
Estella
,
but
the
*NL*
understanding
was
established
that
they
were
necessary
to
her
,
and
*NL*
that
she
was
necessary
to
them
.
Mrs.
Brandley
had
been
a
friend
of
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
's
before
the
time
of
her
seclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Mrs.
Brandley
's
house
and
out
of
Mrs.
Brandley
's
house
,
I
suffered
*NL*
every
kind
and
degree
of
torture
that
Estella
could
cause
me
.
The
*NL*
nature
of
my
relations
with
her
,
which
placed
me
on
terms
of
familiarity
*NL*
without
placing
me
on
terms
of
favor
,
conduced
to
my
distraction
.
*NL*
She
made
use
of
me
to
tease
other
admirers
,
and
she
turned
the
very
*NL*
familiarity
between
herself
and
me
to
the
account
of
putting
a
constant
*NL*
slight
on
my
devotion
to
her
.
If
I
had
been
her
secretary
,
steward
,
*NL*
half-brother
,
poor
relation
,
--
if
I
had
been
a
younger
brother
of
her
*NL*
appointed
husband
,
--
I
could
not
have
seemed
to
myself
further
from
my
*NL*
hopes
when
I
was
nearest
to
her
.
The
privilege
of
calling
her
by
her
*NL*
name
and
hearing
her
call
me
by
mine
became
,
under
the
circumstances
*NL*
an
aggravation
of
my
trials
;
and
while
I
think
it
likely
that
it
almost
*NL*
maddened
her
other
lovers
,
I
know
too
certainly
that
it
almost
maddened
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
admirers
without
end
.
No
doubt
my
jealousy
made
an
admirer
of
*NL*
every
one
who
went
near
her
;
but
there
were
more
than
enough
of
them
*NL*
without
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
her
often
at
Richmond
,
I
heard
of
her
often
in
town
,
and
I
used
*NL*
often
to
take
her
and
the
Brandleys
on
the
water
;
there
were
picnics
,
*NL*
fete
days
,
plays
,
operas
,
concerts
,
parties
,
all
sorts
of
pleasures
,
*NL*
through
which
I
pursued
her
,
--
and
they
were
all
miseries
to
me
.
I
never
*NL*
had
one
hour
's
happiness
in
her
society
,
and
yet
my
mind
all
round
the
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
was
harping
on
the
happiness
of
having
her
with
me
*NL*
unto
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
this
part
of
our
intercourse
,
--
and
it
lasted
,
as
will
*NL*
presently
be
seen
,
for
what
I
then
thought
a
long
time
,
--
she
habitually
*NL*
reverted
to
that
tone
which
expressed
that
our
association
was
forced
*NL*
upon
us
.
There
were
other
times
when
she
would
come
to
a
sudden
check
in
*NL*
this
tone
and
in
all
her
many
tones
,
and
would
seem
to
pity
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
Pip
,
''
she
said
one
evening
,
coming
to
such
a
check
,
when
we
sat
*NL*
apart
at
a
darkening
window
of
the
house
in
Richmond
;
``
will
you
never
*NL*
take
warning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Warning
not
to
be
attracted
by
you
,
do
you
mean
,
Estella
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
mean
!
If
you
do
n't
know
what
I
mean
,
you
are
blind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
replied
that
Love
was
commonly
reputed
blind
,
but
for
the
*NL*
reason
that
I
always
was
restrained
--
and
this
was
not
the
least
of
my
*NL*
miseries
--
by
a
feeling
that
it
was
ungenerous
to
press
myself
upon
her
,
*NL*
when
she
knew
that
she
could
not
choose
but
obey
Miss
Havisham
.
My
*NL*
dread
always
was
,
that
this
knowledge
on
her
part
laid
me
under
a
heavy
*NL*
disadvantage
with
her
pride
,
and
made
me
the
subject
of
a
rebellious
*NL*
struggle
in
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
have
no
warning
given
me
just
now
,
for
you
*NL*
wrote
to
me
to
come
to
you
,
this
time
.

That
's
true
,
''
said
Estella
,
with
a
cold
careless
smile
that
always
*NL*
chilled
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
looking
at
the
twilight
without
,
for
a
little
while
,
she
went
on
*NL*
to
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
has
come
round
when
Miss
Havisham
wishes
to
have
me
for
a
day
*NL*
at
Satis
.
You
are
to
take
me
there
,
and
bring
me
back
,
if
you
will
.
She
*NL*
would
rather
I
did
not
travel
alone
,
and
objects
to
receiving
my
maid
,
*NL*
for
she
has
a
sensitive
horror
of
being
talked
of
by
such
people
.
Can
*NL*
you
take
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
take
you
,
Estella
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
then
?
The
day
after
to-morrow
,
if
you
please
.
You
are
to
pay
*NL*
all
charges
out
of
my
purse
,
You
hear
the
condition
of
your
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
must
obey
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
the
preparation
I
received
for
that
visit
,
or
for
others
*NL*
like
it
;
Miss
Havisham
never
wrote
to
me
,
nor
had
I
ever
so
much
as
seen
*NL*
her
handwriting
.
We
went
down
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
and
we
found
her
*NL*
in
the
room
where
I
had
first
beheld
her
,
and
it
is
needless
to
add
that
*NL*
there
was
no
change
in
Satis
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
even
more
dreadfully
fond
of
Estella
than
she
had
been
when
*NL*
I
last
saw
them
together
;
I
repeat
the
word
advisedly
,
for
there
was
*NL*
something
positively
dreadful
in
the
energy
of
her
looks
and
embraces
.
*NL*
She
hung
upon
Estella
's
beauty
,
hung
upon
her
words
,
hung
upon
her
*NL*
gestures
,
and
sat
mumbling
her
own
trembling
fingers
while
she
looked
at
*NL*
her
,
as
though
she
were
devouring
the
beautiful
creature
she
had
reared
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Estella
she
looked
at
me
,
with
a
searching
glance
that
seemed
to
*NL*
pry
into
my
heart
and
probe
its
wounds
.
``
How
does
she
use
you
,
Pip
;
how
*NL*
does
she
use
you
?
''
she
asked
me
again
,
with
her
witch-like
eagerness
,
*NL*
even
in
Estella
's
hearing
.
But
,
when
we
sat
by
her
flickering
fire
*NL*
at
night
,
she
was
most
weird
;
for
then
,
keeping
Estella
's
hand
drawn
*NL*
through
her
arm
and
clutched
in
her
own
hand
,
she
extorted
from
her
,
*NL*
by
dint
of
referring
back
to
what
Estella
had
told
her
in
her
regular
*NL*
letters
,
the
names
and
conditions
of
the
men
whom
she
had
fascinated
;
*NL*
and
as
Miss
Havisham
dwelt
upon
this
roll
,
with
the
intensity
of
a
mind
*NL*
mortally
hurt
and
diseased
,
she
sat
with
her
other
hand
on
her
crutch
*NL*
stick
,
and
her
chin
on
that
,
and
her
wan
bright
eyes
glaring
at
me
,
a
*NL*
very
spectre
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
in
this
,
wretched
though
it
made
me
,
and
bitter
the
sense
of
*NL*
dependence
and
even
of
degradation
that
it
awakened
,
--
I
saw
in
this
that
*NL*
Estella
was
set
to
wreak
Miss
Havisham
's
revenge
on
men
,
and
that
she
*NL*
was
not
to
be
given
to
me
until
she
had
gratified
it
for
a
term
.
I
saw
*NL*
in
this
,
a
reason
for
her
being
beforehand
assigned
to
me
.
Sending
her
*NL*
out
to
attract
and
torment
and
do
mischief
,
Miss
Havisham
sent
her
with
*NL*
the
malicious
assurance
that
she
was
beyond
the
reach
of
all
admirers
,
*NL*
and
that
all
who
staked
upon
that
cast
were
secured
to
lose
.
I
saw
in
*NL*
this
that
I
,
too
,
was
tormented
by
a
perversion
of
ingenuity
,
even
while
*NL*
the
prize
was
reserved
for
me
.
I
saw
in
this
the
reason
for
my
being
*NL*
staved
off
so
long
and
the
reason
for
my
late
guardian
's
declining
to
*NL*
commit
himself
to
the
formal
knowledge
of
such
a
scheme
.
In
a
word
,
I
*NL*
saw
in
this
Miss
Havisham
as
I
had
her
then
and
there
before
my
eyes
,
*NL*
and
always
had
had
her
before
my
eyes
;
and
I
saw
in
this
,
the
distinct
*NL*
shadow
of
the
darkened
and
unhealthy
house
in
which
her
life
was
hidden
*NL*
from
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
candles
that
lighted
that
room
of
hers
were
placed
in
sconces
on
*NL*
the
wall
.
They
were
high
from
the
ground
,
and
they
burnt
with
the
steady
*NL*
dulness
of
artificial
light
in
air
that
is
seldom
renewed
.
As
I
looked
*NL*
round
at
them
,
and
at
the
pale
gloom
they
made
,
and
at
the
stopped
*NL*
clock
,
and
at
the
withered
articles
of
bridal
dress
upon
the
table
and
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
at
her
own
awful
figure
with
its
ghostly
reflection
*NL*
thrown
large
by
the
fire
upon
the
ceiling
and
the
wall
,
I
saw
in
*NL*
everything
the
construction
that
my
mind
had
come
to
,
repeated
and
*NL*
thrown
back
to
me
.
My
thoughts
passed
into
the
great
room
across
the
*NL*
landing
where
the
table
was
spread
,
and
I
saw
it
written
,
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
the
falls
of
the
cobwebs
from
the
centre-piece
,
in
the
crawlings
of
the
*NL*
spiders
on
the
cloth
,
in
the
tracks
of
the
mice
as
they
betook
their
*NL*
little
quickened
hearts
behind
the
panels
,
and
in
the
gropings
and
*NL*
pausings
of
the
beetles
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
on
the
occasion
of
this
visit
that
some
sharp
words
arose
*NL*
between
Estella
and
Miss
Havisham
.
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
seen
*NL*
them
opposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
seated
by
the
fire
,
as
just
now
described
,
and
Miss
Havisham
*NL*
still
had
Estella
's
arm
drawn
through
her
own
,
and
still
clutched
*NL*
Estella
's
hand
in
hers
,
when
Estella
gradually
began
to
detach
herself
.
*NL*
She
had
shown
a
proud
impatience
more
than
once
before
,
and
had
rather
*NL*
endured
that
fierce
affection
than
accepted
or
returned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
flashing
her
eyes
upon
her
,
``
are
you
tired
*NL*
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
little
tired
of
myself
,
''
replied
Estella
,
disengaging
her
arm
,
*NL*
and
moving
to
the
great
chimney-piece
,
where
she
stood
looking
down
at
*NL*
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
the
truth
,
you
ingrate
!
''
cried
Miss
Havisham
,
passionately
*NL*
striking
her
stick
upon
the
floor
;
``
you
are
tired
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Estella
looked
at
her
with
perfect
composure
,
and
again
looked
down
*NL*
at
the
fire
.
Her
graceful
figure
and
her
beautiful
face
expressed
a
*NL*
self-possessed
indifference
to
the
wild
heat
of
the
other
,
that
was
*NL*
almost
cruel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stock
and
stone
!
''
exclaimed
Miss
Havisham
.
``
You
cold
,
cold
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Estella
,
preserving
her
attitude
of
indifference
as
she
*NL*
leaned
against
the
great
chimney-piece
and
only
moving
her
eyes
;
``
do
you
*NL*
reproach
me
for
being
cold
?
You
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
?
''
was
the
fierce
retort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
know
,
''
said
Estella
.
``
I
am
what
you
have
made
me
.
Take
*NL*
all
the
praise
,
take
all
the
blame
;
take
all
the
success
,
take
all
the
*NL*
failure
;
in
short
,
take
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
look
at
her
,
look
at
her
!
''
cried
Miss
Havisham
,
bitterly
;
``
Look
at
*NL*
her
so
hard
and
thankless
,
on
the
hearth
where
she
was
reared
!
Where
I
*NL*
took
her
into
this
wretched
breast
when
it
was
first
bleeding
from
its
*NL*
stabs
,
and
where
I
have
lavished
years
of
tenderness
upon
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
I
was
no
party
to
the
compact
,
''
said
Estella
,
``
for
if
I
could
*NL*
walk
and
speak
,
when
it
was
made
,
it
was
as
much
as
I
could
do
.
But
what
*NL*
would
you
have
?
You
have
been
very
good
to
me
,
and
I
owe
everything
to
*NL*
you
.
What
would
you
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
,
''
replied
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
by
adoption
,
''
retorted
Estella
,
never
departing
from
the
easy
*NL*
grace
of
her
attitude
,
never
raising
her
voice
as
the
other
did
,
never
*NL*
yielding
either
to
anger
or
tenderness
,
--
``
mother
by
adoption
,
I
have
*NL*
said
that
I
owe
everything
to
you
.
All
I
possess
is
freely
yours
.
All
*NL*
that
you
have
given
me
,
is
at
your
command
to
have
again
.
Beyond
that
,
I
*NL*
have
nothing

And
if
you
ask
me
to
give
you
,
what
you
never
gave
me
,
my
*NL*
gratitude
and
duty
can
not
do
impossibilities

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
never
give
her
love
!
''
cried
Miss
Havisham
,
turning
wildly
to
me
.
*NL*
``
Did
I
never
give
her
a
burning
love

inseparable
from
jealousy
at
all
*NL*
times

from
sharp
pain
,
while
she
speaks
thus
to
me
!
Let
her
call

mad

let
her
call
me
mad

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
call
you
mad

returned
Estella
,
``
I

she
touched
her
bosom
with

excluded

Miss

pushing
away
her
gray
hair

with
both
her
hands

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

former
action

Miss

quite
shrieked

she
*NL*
stretched
out
her
arms
.
``
Estella

Estella

*NL*
*NL*
Estella
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
with
a
kind
of
calm
wonder
,
but
was
*NL*
not
otherwise
disturbed
;
when
the
moment
was
past
,
she
looked
down
at
*NL*
the
fire
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
think

said
Estella
,
raising
her
eyes
after
a
silence
``
why
*NL*
you
should
be
so
unreasonable
when
I
come
to
see
you
after
a
separation

never
forgotten
your
wrongs

their
causes

I
have
never

*NL*
``
Would
it
be
weakness

Miss
Havisham

``
But
*NL*
yes

yes

she
would
call
it
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
begin
to
think

''
said
Estella
,
in
a
musing
way
,
after
another
moment
*NL*
of
calm
wonder
,
``
that
I
almost
understand
how
this
comes
about

up
your
adopted
daughter

in

dark
confinement
of

these
rooms

had
never
let
her
know
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as

the
daylight

which
she
had
never
once
seen
your
face

done

daylight

disappointed

angry

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
,
with
her
head
in
her
hands
,
sat
making
a
low
moaning
,
and
*NL*
swaying
herself
on
her
chair
,
but
gave
no
answer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Or

said
Estella
,

``

is
a
nearer

from
the
dawn

with
your
utmost
energy

might

*NL*
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
daylight

that
it
was
made
to
be
her

enemy

destroyer

she
must
always
turn
against

blighted

*NL*
Miss

sat
listening
-LRB-

it
seemed
so

still
made
no

Miss

had
settled
down
,
I
hardly
knew
how
,
upon
the
floor
,
among
*NL*
the
faded
bridal
relics
with
which
it
was
strewn
.
I
took
advantage
of
*NL*
the
moment
--
I
had
sought
one
from
the
first
--
to
leave
the
room
,
after
*NL*
beseeching
Estella
's
attention
to
her
,
with
a
movement
of
my
hand
.
When
*NL*
I
left
,
Estella
was
yet
standing
by
the
great
chimney-piece
,
just
as
she
*NL*
had
stood
throughout
.
Miss
Havisham
's
gray
hair
was
all
adrift
upon
the
*NL*
ground
,
among
the
other
bridal
wrecks
,
and
was
a
miserable
sight
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
a
depressed
heart
that
I
walked
in
the
starlight
for
an
*NL*
hour
and
more
,
about
the
courtyard
,
and
about
the
brewery
,
and
about
*NL*
the
ruined
garden
.
When
I
at
last
took
courage
to
return
to
the
room
,
I
*NL*
found
Estella
sitting
at
Miss
Havisham
's
knee
,
taking
up
some
stitches
*NL*
in
one
of
those
old
articles
of
dress
that
were
dropping
to
pieces
,
and
*NL*
of
which
I
have
often
been
reminded
since
by
the
faded
tatters
of
old
*NL*
banners
that
I
have
seen
hanging
up
in
cathedrals
.
Afterwards
,
Estella
*NL*
and
I
played
at
cards
,
as
of
yore
,
--
only
we
were
skilful
now
,
and
played
*NL*
French
games
,
--
and
so
the
evening
wore
away
,
and
I
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
in
that
separate
building
across
the
courtyard
.
It
was
the
first
*NL*
time
I
had
ever
lain
down
to
rest
in
Satis
House
,
and
sleep
refused
to
*NL*
come
near
me
.
A
thousand
Miss
Havishams
haunted
me
.
She
was
on
this
side
*NL*
of
my
pillow
,
on
that
,
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
at
the
foot
,
behind
the
*NL*
half-opened
door
of
the
dressing-room
,
in
the
dressing-room
,
in
the
room
*NL*
overhead
,
in
the
room
beneath
,
--
everywhere
.
At
last
,
when
the
night
was
*NL*
slow
to
creep
on
towards
two
o'clock
,
I
felt
that
I
absolutely
could
no
*NL*
longer
bear
the
place
as
a
place
to
lie
down
in
,
and
that
I
must
get
up
.
*NL*
I
therefore
got
up
and
put
on
my
clothes
,
and
went
out
across
the
yard
*NL*
into
the
long
stone
passage
,
designing
to
gain
the
outer
courtyard
and
*NL*
walk
there
for
the
relief
of
my
mind
.
But
I
was
no
sooner
in
the
passage
*NL*
than
I
extinguished
my
candle
;
for
I
saw
Miss
Havisham
going
along
it
*NL*
in
a
ghostly
manner
,
making
a
low
cry
.
I
followed
her
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
and
saw
her
go
up
the
staircase
.
She
carried
a
bare
candle
in
her
hand
,
*NL*
which
she
had
probably
taken
from
one
of
the
sconces
in
her
own
room
,
*NL*
and
was
a
most
unearthly
object
by
its
light
.
Standing
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
staircase
,
I
felt
the
mildewed
air
of
the
feast-chamber
,
without
*NL*
seeing
her
open
the
door
,
and
I
heard
her
walking
there
,
and
so
across
*NL*
into
her
own
room
,
and
so
across
again
into
that
,
never
ceasing
the
low
*NL*
cry
.
After
a
time
,
I
tried
in
the
dark
both
to
get
out
,
and
to
go
back
,
*NL*
but
I
could
do
neither
until
some
streaks
of
day
strayed
in
and
showed
*NL*
me
where
to
lay
my
hands
.
During
the
whole
interval
,
whenever
I
went
to
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
,
I
heard
her
footstep
,
saw
her
light
pass
*NL*
above
,
and
heard
her
ceaseless
low
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
left
next
day
,
there
was
no
revival
of
the
difference
between
*NL*
her
and
Estella
,
nor
was
it
ever
revived
on
any
similar
occasion
;
and
*NL*
there
were
four
similar
occasions
,
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
.
Nor
,
*NL*
did
Miss
Havisham
's
manner
towards
Estella
in
anywise
change
,
except
*NL*
that
I
believed
it
to
have
something
like
fear
infused
among
its
former
*NL*
characteristics
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
turn
this
leaf
of
my
life
,
without
putting
Bentley
*NL*
Drummle
's
name
upon
it
;
or
I
would
,
very
gladly
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
certain
occasion
when
the
Finches
were
assembled
in
force
,
and
when
*NL*
good
feeling
was
being
promoted
in
the
usual
manner
by
nobody
's
agreeing
*NL*
with
anybody
else
,
the
presiding
Finch
called
the
Grove
to
order
,
*NL*
forasmuch
as
Mr.
Drummle
had
not
yet
toasted
a
lady
;
which
,
according
*NL*
to
the
solemn
constitution
of
the
society
,
it
was
the
brute
's
turn
to
*NL*
do
that
day
.
I
thought
I
saw
him
leer
in
an
ugly
way
at
me
while
the
*NL*
decanters
were
going
round
,
but
as
there
was
no
love
lost
between
us
,
*NL*
that
might
easily
be
.
What
was
my
indignant
surprise
when
he
called
upon
*NL*
the
company
to
pledge
him
to
``
Estella
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Estella
who
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
you
mind
,
''
retorted
Drummle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Estella
of
where
?
''
said
I.
``
You
are
bound
to
say
of
where
.
''
Which
he
*NL*
was
,
as
a
Finch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
Richmond
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Drummle
,
putting
me
out
of
the
question
,
*NL*
``
and
a
peerless
beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Much
he
knew
about
peerless
beauties
,
a
mean
,
miserable
idiot
!
I
*NL*
whispered
Herbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
lady
,
''
said
Herbert
,
across
the
table
,
when
the
toast
had
*NL*
been
honored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
''
said
Drummle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
do
I
,
''
I
added
,
with
a
scarlet
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
''
said
Drummle
.
``
O
,
Lord
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
only
retort
--
except
glass
or
crockery
--
that
the
heavy
*NL*
creature
was
capable
of
making
;
but
,
I
became
as
highly
incensed
by
it
*NL*
as
if
it
had
been
barbed
with
wit
,
and
I
immediately
rose
in
my
place
*NL*
and
said
that
I
could
not
but
regard
it
as
being
like
the
honorable
*NL*
Finch
's
impudence
to
come
down
to
that
Grove
,
--
we
always
talked
*NL*
about
coming
down
to
that
Grove
,
as
a
neat
Parliamentary
turn
of
*NL*
expression
,
--
down
to
that
Grove
,
proposing
a
lady
of
whom
he
knew
*NL*
nothing
.
Mr.
Drummle
,
upon
this
,
starting
up
,
demanded
what
I
meant
by
*NL*
that
?
Whereupon
I
made
him
the
extreme
reply
that
I
believed
he
knew
*NL*
where
I
was
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
possible
in
a
Christian
country
to
get
on
without
blood
,
*NL*
after
this
,
was
a
question
on
which
the
Finches
were
divided
.
The
debate
*NL*
upon
it
grew
so
lively
,
indeed
,
that
at
least
six
more
honorable
members
*NL*
told
six
more
,
during
the
discussion
,
that
they
believed
they
knew
where
*NL*
they
were
to
be
found
.
However
,
it
was
decided
at
last
-LRB-
the
Grove
being
*NL*
a
Court
of
Honor
-RRB-
that
if
Mr.
Drummle
would
bring
never
so
slight
*NL*
a
certificate
from
the
lady
,
importing
that
he
had
the
honor
of
her
*NL*
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Pip
must
express
his
regret
,
as
a
gentleman
and
a
*NL*
Finch
,
for
``
having
been
betrayed
into
a
warmth
which
.
''
Next
day
was
*NL*
appointed
for
the
production
-LRB-
lest
our
honor
should
take
cold
from
*NL*
delay
-RRB-
,
and
next
day
Drummle
appeared
with
a
polite
little
avowal
in
*NL*
Estella
's
hand
,
that
she
had
had
the
honor
of
dancing
with
him
several
*NL*
times
.
This
left
me
no
course
but
to
regret
that
I
had
been
``
betrayed
*NL*
into
a
warmth
which
,
''
and
on
the
whole
to
repudiate
,
as
untenable
,
the
*NL*
idea
that
I
was
to
be
found
anywhere
.
Drummle
and
I
then
sat
snorting
*NL*
at
one
another
for
an
hour
,
while
the
Grove
engaged
in
indiscriminate
*NL*
contradiction
,
and
finally
the
promotion
of
good
feeling
was
declared
to
*NL*
have
gone
ahead
at
an
amazing
rate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
tell
this
lightly
,
but
it
was
no
light
thing
to
me
.
For
,
I
can
not
*NL*
adequately
express
what
pain
it
gave
me
to
think
that
Estella
should
*NL*
show
any
favor
to
a
contemptible
,
clumsy
,
sulky
booby
,
so
very
far
below
*NL*
the
average
.
To
the
present
moment
,
I
believe
it
to
have
been
referable
*NL*
to
some
pure
fire
of
generosity
and
disinterestedness
in
my
love
for
*NL*
her
,
that
I
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
her
stooping
to
that
hound
.
*NL*
No
doubt
I
should
have
been
miserable
whomsoever
she
had
favored
;
but
*NL*
a
worthier
object
would
have
caused
me
a
different
kind
and
degree
of
*NL*
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
for
me
to
find
out
,
and
I
did
soon
find
out
,
that
Drummle
*NL*
had
begun
to
follow
her
closely
,
and
that
she
allowed
him
to
do
it
.
A
*NL*
little
while
,
and
he
was
always
in
pursuit
of
her
,
and
he
and
I
crossed
*NL*
one
another
every
day
.
He
held
on
,
in
a
dull
persistent
way
,
and
Estella
*NL*
held
him
on
;
now
with
encouragement
,
now
with
discouragement
,
now
almost
*NL*
flattering
him
,
now
openly
despising
him
,
now
knowing
him
very
well
,
now
*NL*
scarcely
remembering
who
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spider
,
as
Mr.
Jaggers
had
called
him
,
was
used
to
lying
in
wait
,
*NL*
however
,
and
had
the
patience
of
his
tribe
.
Added
to
that
,
he
had
a
*NL*
blockhead
confidence
in
his
money
and
in
his
family
greatness
,
*NL*
which
sometimes
did
him
good
service
,
--
almost
taking
the
place
of
*NL*
concentration
and
determined
purpose
.
So
,
the
Spider
,
doggedly
watching
*NL*
Estella
,
outwatched
many
brighter
insects
,
and
would
often
uncoil
*NL*
himself
and
drop
at
the
right
nick
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
certain
Assembly
Ball
at
Richmond
-LRB-
there
used
to
be
Assembly
Balls
*NL*
at
most
places
then
-RRB-
,
where
Estella
had
outshone
all
other
beauties
,
*NL*
this
blundering
Drummle
so
hung
about
her
,
and
with
so
much
toleration
*NL*
on
her
part
,
that
I
resolved
to
speak
to
her
concerning
him
.
I
took
the
*NL*
next
opportunity
;
which
was
when
she
was
waiting
for
Mrs.
Blandley
to
*NL*
take
her
home
,
and
was
sitting
apart
among
some
flowers
,
ready
to
go
.
*NL*
I
was
with
her
,
for
I
almost
always
accompanied
them
to
and
from
such
*NL*
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
tired
,
Estella
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
rather
,
I
should
not
be
;
for
I
have
my
letter
to
Satis
House
to
*NL*
write
,
before
I
go
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Recounting
to-night
's
triumph
?
''
said
I.
``
Surely
a
very
poor
one
,
*NL*
Estella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
I
did
n't
know
there
had
been
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Estella
,
''
said
I
,
``
do
look
at
that
fellow
in
the
corner
yonder
,
who
is
*NL*
looking
over
here
at
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
look
at
him
?
''
returned
Estella
,
with
her
eyes
on
me
*NL*
instead
.
``
What
is
there
in
that
fellow
in
the
corner
yonder
,
--
to
use
*NL*
your
words
,
--
that
I
need
look
at
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
that
is
the
very
question
I
want
to
ask
you
,
''
said
I.
``
For
he
*NL*
has
been
hovering
about
you
all
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moths
,
and
all
sorts
of
ugly
creatures
,
''
replied
Estella
,
with
a
glance
*NL*
towards
him
,
``
hover
about
a
lighted
candle
.
Can
the
candle
help
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
returned
;
``
but
can
not
the
Estella
help
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
she
,
laughing
,
after
a
moment
,
``
perhaps
.
Yes
.
Anything
you
*NL*
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Estella
,
do
hear
me
speak

It
makes
me
wretched
that
you
should
*NL*
encourage
a
man
so
generally
despised
as
Drummle
.
You
know
he
is
*NL*
despised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

as
ungainly

ill-tempered

fellow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
he
has
nothing
to
recommend
him
but
money
and
a
ridiculous

roll

addle-headed
predecessors

now
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
she
again
;
and
each
time
she
said
it
,
she
opened
her
lovely
*NL*
eyes
the
wider
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
overcome
the
difficulty
of
getting
past
that
monosyllable
,
I
took
it
*NL*
from
her
,
and
said
,
repeating
it
with
emphasis
,
``
Well
!
Then
,
that
is
why
*NL*
it
makes
me
wretched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
if
I
could
have
believed
that
she
favored
Drummle
with
any
idea
of
*NL*
making
me-me
--
wretched
,
I
should
have
been
in
better
heart
about
it
;
*NL*
but
in
that
habitual
way
of
hers
,
she
put
me
so
entirely
out
of
the
*NL*
question
,
that
I
could
believe
nothing
of
the
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip

''
said
Estella
,
casting
her
glance
over
the
room
,
``
do
n't
be
foolish

about
its
effect

you

It
may
have
its
effect
on
others

may
be
*NL*
meant
to
have

It
's
not
worth
discussing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
it
is

said
I
,
``
because
I
can
not
bear
that
people
should
say

`
she
*NL*
throws
away
her
graces
and
attractions
on
a
mere
boor

the
lowest
in
the
*NL*
crowd

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
bear
it

said
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
do
n't
be
so
proud
,
Estella
,
and
so
inflexible

*NL*
*NL*
``
Calls
me
proud
and
inflexible
in
this
breath

said
Estella
,
opening
*NL*
her
hands
.
``
And
in
his
last
breath
reproached
me
for
stooping
to
a
*NL*
boor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
doubt
you
do
,
''
said
I
,
something
hurriedly
,
``
for
I
have
*NL*
seen
you
give
him
looks
and
smiles
this
very
night
,
such
as
you
never
*NL*
give
to
--
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
then
,
''
said
Estella
,
turning
suddenly
with
a
fixed
and
*NL*
serious
,
if
not
angry
,
look
,
``
to
deceive
and
entrap
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
deceive
and
entrap
him

Estella

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
many
others

all
of
them

you

Here
is
Mrs.
Brandley

I
'll
*NL*
say
no
more

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
And
now
that
I
have
given
the
one
chapter
to
the
theme
that
so
filled
my
*NL*
heart
,
and
so
often
made
it
ache
and
ache
again
,
I
pass
on
unhindered
,
*NL*
to
the
event
that
had
impended
over
me
longer
yet
;
the
event
that
had
*NL*
begun
to
be
prepared
for
,
before
I
knew
that
the
world
held
Estella
,
*NL*
and
in
the
days
when
her
baby
intelligence
was
receiving
its
first
*NL*
distortions
from
Miss
Havisham
's
wasting
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Eastern
story
,
the
heavy
slab
that
was
to
fall
on
the
bed
of
*NL*
state
in
the
flush
of
conquest
was
slowly
wrought
out
of
the
quarry
,
the
*NL*
tunnel
for
the
rope
to
hold
it
in
its
place
was
slowly
carried
through
*NL*
the
leagues
of
rock
,
the
slab
was
slowly
raised
and
fitted
in
the
roof
,
*NL*
the
rope
was
rove
to
it
and
slowly
taken
through
the
miles
of
hollow
to
*NL*
the
great
iron
ring
.
All
being
made
ready
with
much
labor
,
and
the
hour
*NL*
come
,
the
sultan
was
aroused
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
and
the
sharpened
*NL*
axe
that
was
to
sever
the
rope
from
the
great
iron
ring
was
put
into
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
he
struck
with
it
,
and
the
rope
parted
and
rushed
away
,
and
*NL*
the
ceiling
fell
.
So
,
in
my
case
;
all
the
work
,
near
and
afar
,
that
*NL*
tended
to
the
end
,
had
been
accomplished
;
and
in
an
instant
the
blow
was
*NL*
struck
,
and
the
roof
of
my
stronghold
dropped
upon
me
.

Chapter
XXXIX
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
three-and-twenty
years
of
age
.
Not
another
word
had
I
heard
to
*NL*
enlighten
me
on
the
subject
of
my
expectations
,
and
my
twenty-third
*NL*
birthday
was
a
week
gone
.
We
had
left
Barnard
's
Inn
more
than
a
year
,
*NL*
and
lived
in
the
Temple
.
Our
chambers
were
in
Garden-court
,
down
by
the
*NL*
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pocket
and
I
had
for
some
time
parted
company
as
to
our
original
*NL*
relations
,
though
we
continued
on
the
best
terms
.
Notwithstanding
my
*NL*
inability
to
settle
to
anything
,
--
which
I
hope
arose
out
of
the
restless
*NL*
and
incomplete
tenure
on
which
I
held
my
means
,
--
I
had
a
taste
for
*NL*
reading
,
and
read
regularly
so
many
hours
a
day
.
That
matter
of
*NL*
Herbert
's
was
still
progressing
,
and
everything
with
me
was
as
I
have
*NL*
brought
it
down
to
the
close
of
the
last
preceding
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Business
had
taken
Herbert
on
a
journey
to
Marseilles
.
I
was
alone
,
and
*NL*
had
a
dull
sense
of
being
alone
.
Dispirited
and
anxious
,
long
hoping
*NL*
that
to-morrow
or
next
week
would
clear
my
way
,
and
long
disappointed
,
I
*NL*
sadly
missed
the
cheerful
face
and
ready
response
of
my
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
wretched
weather
;
stormy
and
wet
,
stormy
and
wet
;
and
mud
,
mud
,
*NL*
mud
,
deep
in
all
the
streets
.
Day
after
day
,
a
vast
heavy
veil
had
been
*NL*
driving
over
London
from
the
East
,
and
it
drove
still
,
as
if
in
the
East
*NL*
there
were
an
Eternity
of
cloud
and
wind
.
So
furious
had
been
the
gusts
,
*NL*
that
high
buildings
in
town
had
had
the
lead
stripped
off
their
roofs
;
*NL*
and
in
the
country
,
trees
had
been
torn
up
,
and
sails
of
windmills
*NL*
carried
away
;
and
gloomy
accounts
had
come
in
from
the
coast
,
of
*NL*
shipwreck
and
death
.
Violent
blasts
of
rain
had
accompanied
these
rages
*NL*
of
wind
,
and
the
day
just
closed
as
I
sat
down
to
read
had
been
the
*NL*
worst
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alterations
have
been
made
in
that
part
of
the
Temple
since
that
time
,
*NL*
and
it
has
not
now
so
lonely
a
character
as
it
had
then
,
nor
is
it
so
*NL*
exposed
to
the
river
.
We
lived
at
the
top
of
the
last
house
,
and
the
*NL*
wind
rushing
up
the
river
shook
the
house
that
night
,
like
discharges
*NL*
of
cannon
,
or
breakings
of
a
sea
.
When
the
rain
came
with
it
and
dashed
*NL*
against
the
windows
,
I
thought
,
raising
my
eyes
to
them
as
they
*NL*
rocked
,
that
I
might
have
fancied
myself
in
a
storm-beaten
lighthouse
.
*NL*
Occasionally
,
the
smoke
came
rolling
down
the
chimney
as
though
it
could
*NL*
not
bear
to
go
out
into
such
a
night
;
and
when
I
set
the
doors
open
and
*NL*
looked
down
the
staircase
,
the
staircase
lamps
were
blown
out
;
and
when
*NL*
I
shaded
my
face
with
my
hands
and
looked
through
the
black
windows
*NL*
-LRB-
opening
them
ever
so
little
was
out
of
the
question
in
the
teeth
of
*NL*
such
wind
and
rain
-RRB-
,
I
saw
that
the
lamps
in
the
court
were
blown
out
,
*NL*
and
that
the
lamps
on
the
bridges
and
the
shore
were
shuddering
,
and
*NL*
that
the
coal-fires
in
barges
on
the
river
were
being
carried
away
*NL*
before
the
wind
like
red-hot
splashes
in
the
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
read
with
my
watch
upon
the
table
,
purposing
to
close
my
book
*NL*
at
eleven
o'clock
.
As
I
shut
it
,
Saint
Paul
's
,
and
all
the
many
*NL*
church-clocks
in
the
City
--
some
leading
,
some
accompanying
,
some
*NL*
following
--
struck
that
hour
.
The
sound
was
curiously
flawed
by
the
wind
;
*NL*
and
I
was
listening
,
and
thinking
how
the
wind
assailed
and
tore
it
,
*NL*
when
I
heard
a
footstep
on
the
stair
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
nervous
folly
made
me
start
,
and
awfully
connect
it
with
the
*NL*
footstep
of
my
dead
sister
,
matters
not
.
It
was
past
in
a
moment
,
and
I
*NL*
listened
again
,
and
heard
the
footstep
stumble
in
coming
on
.
*NL*
Remembering
then
,
that
the
staircase-lights
were
blown
out
,
I
took
up
*NL*
my
reading-lamp
and
went
out
to
the
stair-head
.
Whoever
was
below
had
*NL*
stopped
on
seeing
my
lamp
,
for
all
was
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
some
one
down
there
,
is
there
not
?
''
I
called
out
,
looking
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
a
voice
from
the
darkness
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
floor
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
top
.
Mr.
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
name
.
--
There
is
nothing
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
the
matter
,
''
returned
the
voice
.
And
the
man
came
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
with
my
lamp
held
out
over
the
stair-rail
,
and
he
came
slowly
*NL*
within
its
light
.
It
was
a
shaded
lamp
,
to
shine
upon
a
book
,
and
its
*NL*
circle
of
light
was
very
contracted
;
so
that
he
was
in
it
for
a
mere
*NL*
instant
,
and
then
out
of
it
.
In
the
instant
,
I
had
seen
a
face
that
was
*NL*
strange
to
me
,
looking
up
with
an
incomprehensible
air
of
being
touched
*NL*
and
pleased
by
the
sight
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moving
the
lamp
as
the
man
moved
,
I
made
out
that
he
was
substantially
*NL*
dressed
,
but
roughly
,
like
a
voyager
by
sea
.
That
he
had
long
iron-gray
*NL*
hair
.
That
his
age
was
about
sixty
.
That
he
was
a
muscular
man
,
strong
*NL*
on
his
legs
,
and
that
he
was
browned
and
hardened
by
exposure
to
*NL*
weather
.
As
he
ascended
the
last
stair
or
two
,
and
the
light
of
my
lamp
*NL*
included
us
both
,
I
saw
,
with
a
stupid
kind
of
amazement
,
that
he
was
*NL*
holding
out
both
his
hands
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
what
is
your
business
?
''
I
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
business
?
''
he
repeated
,
pausing
.
``
Ah
!
Yes
.
I
will
explain
my
*NL*
business
,
by
your
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
;
``
I
wish
to
come
in
,
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
asked
him
the
question
inhospitably
enough
,
for
I
resented
the
*NL*
sort
of
bright
and
gratified
recognition
that
still
shone
in
his
face
.
*NL*
I
resented
it
,
because
it
seemed
to
imply
that
he
expected
me
to
respond
*NL*
to
it
.
But
I
took
him
into
the
room
I
had
just
left
,
and
,
having
set
the
*NL*
lamp
on
the
table
,
asked
him
as
civilly
as
I
could
to
explain
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
about
him
with
the
strangest
air
,
--
an
air
of
wondering
*NL*
pleasure
,
as
if
he
had
some
part
in
the
things
he
admired
,
--
and
he
*NL*
pulled
off
a
rough
outer
coat
,
and
his
hat
.
Then
,
I
saw
that
his
head
*NL*
was
furrowed
and
bald
,
and
that
the
long
iron-gray
hair
grew
only
on
*NL*
its
sides
.
But
,
I
saw
nothing
that
in
the
least
explained
him
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
I
saw
him
next
moment
,
once
more
holding
out
both
his
hands
to
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
said
I
,
half
suspecting
him
to
be
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
in
his
looking
at
me
,
and
slowly
rubbed
his
right
hand
over
*NL*
his
head
.
``
It
's
disapinting
to
a
man
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
coarse
broken
*NL*
voice
,
``
arter
having
looked
for
`
ard
so
distant
,
and
come
so
fur
;
but
*NL*
you
're
not
to
blame
for
that
,
--
neither
on
us
is
to
blame
for
that
.
I
'll
*NL*
speak
in
half
a
minute
.
Give
me
half
a
minute
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
on
a
chair
that
stood
before
the
fire
,
and
covered
his
*NL*
forehead
with
his
large
brown
veinous
hands
.
I
looked
at
him
attentively
*NL*
then
,
and
recoiled
a
little
from
him
;
but
I
did
not
know
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
one
nigh
,
''
said
he
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
;
``
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
,
a
stranger
coming
into
my
rooms
at
this
time
of
the
night
,
*NL*
ask
that
question
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
game
one
,
''
he
returned
,
shaking
his
head
at
me
with
a
*NL*
deliberate
affection
,
at
once
most
unintelligible
and
most
exasperating
;
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
've
grow
'd
up
,
a
game
one
!
But
do
n't
catch
hold
of
me
.
*NL*
You
'd
be
sorry
arterwards
to
have
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
relinquished
the
intention
he
had
detected
,
for
I
knew
him
!
Even
yet
*NL*
I
could
not
recall
a
single
feature
,
but
I
knew
him
!
If
the
wind
and
*NL*
the
rain
had
driven
away
the
intervening
years
,
had
scattered
all
the
*NL*
intervening
objects
,
had
swept
us
to
the
churchyard
where
we
first
stood
*NL*
face
to
face
on
such
different
levels
,
I
could
not
have
known
my
convict
*NL*
more
distinctly
than
I
knew
him
now
as
he
sat
in
the
chair
before
the
*NL*
fire
.
No
need
to
take
a
file
from
his
pocket
and
show
it
to
me
;
no
need
*NL*
to
take
the
handkerchief
from
his
neck
and
twist
it
round
his
head
;
no
*NL*
need
to
hug
himself
with
both
his
arms
,
and
take
a
shivering
turn
across
*NL*
the
room
,
looking
back
at
me
for
recognition
.
I
knew
him
before
he
gave
*NL*
me
one
of
those
aids
,
though
,
a
moment
before
,
I
had
not
been
conscious
*NL*
of
remotely
suspecting
his
identity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
back
to
where
I
stood
,
and
again
held
out
both
his
hands
.
*NL*
Not
knowing
what
to
do
,
--
for
,
in
my
astonishment
I
had
lost
my
*NL*
self-possession
,
--
I
reluctantly
gave
him
my
hands
.
He
grasped
them
*NL*
heartily
,
raised
them
to
his
lips
,
kissed
them
,
and
still
held
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
acted
noble
,
my
boy
,
''
said
he
.
``
Noble
,
Pip
!
And
I
have
never
forgot
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
change
in
his
manner
as
if
he
were
even
going
to
embrace
me
,
I
laid
*NL*
a
hand
upon
his
breast
and
put
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
''
said
I.
``
Keep
off
!
If
you
are
grateful
to
me
for
what
I
did
when
*NL*
I
was
a
little
child
,
I
hope
you
have
shown
your
gratitude
by
mending
*NL*
your
way
of
life
.
If
you
have
come
here
to
thank
me
,
it
was
not
*NL*
necessary
.
Still
,
however
you
have
found
me
out
,
there
must
be
something
*NL*
good
in
the
feeling
that
has
brought
you
here
,
and
I
will
not
repulse
*NL*
you
;
but
surely
you
must
understand
that
--
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
attention
was
so
attracted
by
the
singularity
of
his
fixed
look
at
*NL*
me
,
that
the
words
died
away
on
my
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
was
a
saying
,
''
he
observed
,
when
we
had
confronted
one
another
*NL*
in
silence
,
``
that
surely
I
must
understand
.
What
,
surely
must
I
*NL*
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
not
wish
to
renew
that
chance
intercourse
with

of
long
*NL*
ago
,
under
these

.
I
am
glad
to
believe
you

*NL*
repented

recovered
yourself

I

have
come
to

But
*NL*
our

are
different
ways
,
none
the
less

You
are
wet
,
and
you
look
*NL*
weary

Will
you
drink
something
before

go

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
replaced
his
neckerchief
loosely
,
and
had
stood
,
keenly
observant
*NL*
of
me
,
biting
a
long
end
of
it
.
``
I
think
,
''
he
answered
,
still
with
the
*NL*
end
at
his
mouth
and
still
observant
of
me
,
``
that
I
will
drink
-LRB-
I
thank
*NL*
you
-RRB-
afore
I
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
tray
ready
on
a
side-table
.
I
brought
it
to
the
table
*NL*
near
the
fire
,
and
asked
him
what
he
would
have
?
He
touched
one
of
the
*NL*
bottles
without
looking
at
it
or
speaking
,
and
I
made
him
some
hot
rum
*NL*
and
water
.
I
tried
to
keep
my
hand
steady
while
I
did
so
,
but
his
look
*NL*
at
me
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
the
long
draggled
end
of
his
*NL*
neckerchief
between
his
teeth
--
evidently
forgotten
--
made
my
hand
very
*NL*
difficult
to
master
.
When
at
last
I
put
the
glass
to
him
,
I
saw
with
*NL*
amazement
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
this
time
I
had
remained
standing
,
not
to
disguise
that
I
wished
*NL*
him
gone
.
But
I
was
softened
by
the
softened
aspect
of
the
man
,
and
felt
*NL*
a
touch
of
reproach
.
``
I
hope
,
''
said
I
,
hurriedly
putting
something
into
*NL*
a
glass
for
myself
,
and
drawing
a
chair
to
the
table
,
``
that
you
will
not
*NL*
think
I
spoke
harshly
to
you
just
now
.
I
had
no
intention
of
doing
it
,
*NL*
and
I
am
sorry
for
it
if
I
did
.
I
wish
you
well
and
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
put
my
glass
to
my
lips
,
he
glanced
with
surprise
at
the
end
of
his
*NL*
neckerchief
,
dropping
from
his
mouth
when
he
opened
it
,
and
stretched
*NL*
out
his
hand
.
I
gave
him
mine
,
and
then
he
drank
,
and
drew
his
sleeve
*NL*
across
his
eyes
and
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
living
?
''
I
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
a
sheep-farmer
,
stock-breeder
,
other
trades
besides

away
in

the

''
said
he
;
``
many
a
thousand
mile
of
stormy
water
off
from
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

no

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
Without
stopping
to
try
to
understand
those
words
or
the
tone
in
which
*NL*
they
were
spoken
,
I
turned
off
to
a
point
that
had
just
come
into
my
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
seen
a
messenger
you
once
sent
to
me
,
''
I
inquired
,
``
since
*NL*
he
undertook
that
trust
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
set
eyes
upon

I
war
n't
likely
to
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
faithfully
,
and
he
brought
me
the
two
one-pound
notes
.
I
was
*NL*
a
poor
boy
then
,
as
you
know
,
and
to
a
poor
boy
they
were
a
little
*NL*
fortune
.
But
,
like
you
,
I
have
done
well
since
,
and
you
must
let
me
pay
*NL*
them
back
.
You
can
put
them
to
some
other
poor
boy
's
use

''
I
took
out
my
*NL*
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
me
as
I
laid
my
purse
upon
the
table
and
opened
it
,
and
he
*NL*
watched
me
as
I
separated
two
one-pound
notes
from
its
contents
.
They
*NL*
were
clean
and
new
,
and
I
spread
them
out
and
handed
them
over
to
*NL*
him
.
Still
watching
me
,
he
laid
them
one
upon
the
other
,
folded
them
*NL*
long-wise
,
gave
them
a
twist
,
set
fire
to
them
at
the
lamp
,
and
dropped
*NL*
the
ashes
into
the
tray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
make
so
bold
,
''
he
said
then
,
with
a
smile
that
was
like
a
frown
,
*NL*
and
with
a
frown
that
was
like
a
smile
,
``
as
ask
you
how
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

*NL*
*NL*
He
emptied
his
glass
,
got
up
,
and
stood
at
the
side
of
the
fire
,
with
*NL*
his
heavy
brown
hand
on
the
mantel-shelf
.
He
put
a
foot
up
to
the
bars
,
*NL*
to
dry
and
warm
it
,
and
the
wet
boot
began
to
steam
;
but
,
he
neither
*NL*
looked
at
it

nor
at
the
fire

but
steadily
looked
at
me
.
It
was
only
*NL*
now
that
I
began
to
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
lips
had
parted
,
and
had
shaped
some
words
that
were
*NL*
without
sound
,
I
forced
myself
to
tell
him
-LRB-
though
I
could
not
do
it
*NL*
distinctly
-RRB-
,
that
I
had
been
chosen
to
succeed
to
some
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
a

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
faltered
,
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
I
faltered
again

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
Convict
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
With
my
heart
beating
like
a
heavy
hammer
of
disordered
action
,
I
rose
*NL*
out
of
my
chair
,
and
stood
with
my
hand
upon
the
back
of
it

looking
*NL*
wildly
at
him

*NL*
``

went
on

Would

*NL*
*NL*
All
the
truth
of
my
position
came
flashing
on
me
;
and
its
*NL*
disappointments
,
dangers
,
disgraces

consequences

rushed
*NL*
in
in
such
a

to
struggle

for
every

I
drew

*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
have
spoken
one
word
,
though
it
had
been
to
save
my
life

*NL*
I
stood
,
with
a
hand
on
the
chair-back
and
a
hand
on
my
breast
,
where
*NL*
I
seemed
to
be
suffocating

I
stood
so
,
looking
wildly
at
him
,
until
I
*NL*
grasped
at
the
chair
,
when
the
room
began
to
surge
and
turn
.
He
caught
*NL*
me
,
drew
me
to
the
sofa
,
put
me
up
against
the
cushions
,
and
bent
on
one
*NL*
knee
before
me

bringing
the
face

I

well
remembered

I

very

mine

*NL*
*NL*
The
abhorrence
in

I
held
the

the
dread
I
had
of
him
,
the
*NL*
repugnance
with
which
I
shrank
from

could

*NL*
In
his
heat
and
triumph
,
and
in
his
knowledge
that
I
had
been
nearly
*NL*
fainting
,
he
did
not
remark

It

turning

recoiled
from

touch
as

turning

round
the

Again

cold

he

bright

you

the

thoughts
on

*NL*
*NL*
O
Estella

Estella
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
shall
be
yourn
,
dear
boy
,
if
money
can
buy
'em

Not
that
a
*NL*
gentleman
like
you
,
so
well
set
up
as
you
,

n't

'em
off
of
his

but
money
shall
back

Let
me
finish
wot
I
was
a
telling
you
,
*NL*
dear
boy
.
From
that
there
hut
and
that
there
hiring-out
,
I
got
money
*NL*
left
me
by
my
master
-LRB-
which
died
,
and
had
been
the
same
as
me
-RRB-
,
and
got
*NL*
my
liberty
and
went
for
myself
.
In
every
single
thing
I
went
for
,
I
went
*NL*
for
you
.
`
Lord
strike
a
blight
upon
it
,
'
I
says
,
wotever
it
was
I
went
*NL*
for
,
`
if
it
ai
n't
for
him
!
'
It
all
prospered
wonderful
.
As
I
giv
'
you
*NL*
to
understand
just
now
,
I
'm
famous
for
it
.
It
was
the
money
left
me
,
and
*NL*
the
gains
of
the
first
few
year
wot
I
sent
home
to
Mr.
Jaggers
--
all
for
*NL*
you
--
when
he
first
come
arter
you
,
agreeable
to
my
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
O
that
he
had
never
come
!
That
he
had
left
me
at
the
forge
,
--
far
from
*NL*
contented
,
yet
,
by
comparison
happy
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
dear
boy
,
it
was
a
recompense
to
me
,
look
`
ee
here
,
to
know
in
*NL*
secret
that
I
was
making
a
gentleman
.
The
blood
horses
of
them
colonists
*NL*
might
fling
up
the
dust
over
me
as
I
was
walking
;
what
do
I
say
?
I
says
*NL*
to
myself
,
`
I
'm
making
a
better
gentleman
nor
ever
you
'll
be
!
'
When
*NL*
one
of
'em
says
to
another
,
`
He
was
a
convict
,
a
few
year
ago
,
and
is
a
*NL*
ignorant
common
fellow
now
,
for
all
he
's
lucky
,

what
do
I
say
?
I
says
*NL*
to
myself

If
I
ai
n't
a

yet
ai
n't
got
no

I

*NL*
the
owner

such
.
All
on
you
owns
stock
and
land
;
which
on
you
owns
a
*NL*
brought-up
London
gentleman
?
'
This
way
I
kep
myself
a
going
.
And
this
*NL*
way
I
held
steady
afore
my
mind
that
I
would
for
certain
come
one
day
*NL*
and
see
my
boy
,
and
make
myself
known
to
him
,
on
his
own
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
.
I
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
for
*NL*
anything
I
knew
,
his
hand
might
be
stained
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

easy

for
me

But
I
held
to
it
,
and
the
harder
it
was
,
the
stronger
I
held
,
for
*NL*
I
was
determined
,
and
my
mind
firm
made
up
.
At
last
I
done
it
.
Dear
boy
,
*NL*
I
done
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
collect
my
thoughts
,
but
I
was
stunned
.
Throughout
,
I
had
*NL*
seemed
to
myself
to
attend
more
to
the
wind
and
the
rain
than
to
him
;
*NL*
even
now
,
I
could
not
separate
his
voice
from
those
voices
,
though
those
*NL*
were
loud
and
his
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
will
you
put
me
?
''
he
asked
,
presently
.
``
I
must
be
put
somewheres
,
*NL*
dear
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
sleep
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
And
to
sleep
long
and
sound
,
''
he
answered
;
``
for
I
've
been
*NL*
sea-tossed
and
sea-washed
,
months
and
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
and
companion

''
said
I
,
rising
from
the
sofa
,
``
is
absent
;
you
*NL*
must
have
his
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
come
back
to-morrow
;
will
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
,
answering
almost
mechanically
,
in
spite
of
my
utmost
*NL*
efforts
;
``
not
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
look
`
ee
here
,
dear
boy
,
''
he
said
,
dropping
his
voice
,
and
*NL*
laying
a
long
finger
on
my
breast
in
an
impressive
manner
,
``
caution
is
*NL*
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
Caution
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
By

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
death
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sent
for
life

It
's
death
to
come
back
.
There
's
been
overmuch
*NL*
coming
back
of
late
years
,
and
I
should
of
a
certainty
be
hanged
if
*NL*
took
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
needed
but
this
;
the
wretched
man
,
after
loading
wretched
me
*NL*
with
his
gold
and
silver
chains
for
years
,
had
risked
his
life
to
come
*NL*
to
me
,
and
I
held
it
there
in
my
keeping
!
If
I
had
loved
him
instead
*NL*
of
abhorring
him
;
if
I
had
been
attracted
to
him
by
the
strongest
*NL*
admiration
and
affection
,
instead
of
shrinking
from
him
with
the
*NL*
strongest
repugnance
;
it
could
have
been
no
worse
.
On
the
contrary
,
it
*NL*
would
have
been
better
,
for
his
preservation
would
then
have
naturally
*NL*
and
tenderly
addressed
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
care
was
to
close
the
shutters
,
so
that
no
light
might
be
seen
*NL*
from
without
,
and
then
to
close
and
make
fast
the
doors
.
While
I
did
so
,
*NL*
he
stood
at
the
table
drinking
rum
and
eating
biscuit
;
and
when
I
saw
*NL*
him
thus
engaged
,
I
saw
my
convict
on
the
marshes
at
his
meal
again
.
It
*NL*
almost
seemed
to
me
as
if
he
must
stoop
down
presently
,
to
file
at
his
*NL*
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
gone
into
Herbert
's
room
,
and
had
shut
off
any
other
*NL*
communication
between
it
and
the
staircase
than
through
the
room
in
*NL*
which
our
conversation
had
been
held
,
I
asked
him
if
he
would
go
to
bed
?
*NL*
He
said
yes
,
but
asked
me
for
some
of
my
``
gentleman
's
linen
''
to
put
*NL*
on
in
the
morning
.
I
brought
it
out
,
and
laid
it
ready
for
him
,
and
my
*NL*
blood
again
ran
cold
when
he
again
took
me
by
both
hands
to
give
me
good
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
away
from
him
,
without
knowing
how
I
did
it
,
and
mended
the
fire
*NL*
in
the
room
where
we
had
been
together
,
and
sat
down
by
it
,
afraid
to
go
*NL*
to
bed
.
For
an
hour
or
more
,
I
remained
too
stunned
to
think
;
and
it
*NL*
was
not
until
I
began
to
think
,
that
I
began
fully
to
know
how
wrecked
I
*NL*
was
,
and
how
the
ship
in
which
I
had
sailed
was
gone
to
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
's
intentions
towards
me
,
all
a
mere
dream
;
Estella
not
*NL*
designed
for
me
;
I
only
suffered
in
Satis
House
as
a
convenience
,
a
*NL*
sting
for
the
greedy
relations
,
a
model
with
a
mechanical
heart
to
*NL*
practise
on
when
no
other
practice
was
at
hand
;
those
were
the
first
*NL*
smarts
I
had
.
But
,
sharpest
and
deepest
pain
of
all
,
--
it
was
for
the
*NL*
convict
,
guilty
of
I
knew
not
what
crimes
,
and
liable
to
be
taken
out
*NL*
of
those
rooms
where
I
sat
thinking
,
and
hanged
at
the
Old
Bailey
door
,
*NL*
that
I
had
deserted
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
have
gone
back
to
Joe
now
,
I
would
not
have
gone
back
to
*NL*
Biddy
now
,
for
any
consideration
;
simply
,
I
suppose
,
because
my
sense
of
*NL*
my
own
worthless
conduct
to
them
was
greater
than
every
consideration
.
*NL*
No
wisdom
on
earth
could
have
given
me
the
comfort
that
I
should
have
*NL*
derived
from
their
simplicity
and
fidelity
;
but
I
could
never
,
never
,
*NL*
undo
what
I
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
every
rage
of
wind
and
rush
of
rain
,
I
heard
pursuers
.
Twice
,
I
could
*NL*
have
sworn
there
was
a
knocking
and
whispering
at
the
outer
door
.
With
*NL*
these
fears
upon
me
,
I
began
either
to
imagine
or
recall
that
I
had
had
*NL*
mysterious
warnings
of
this
man
's
approach
.
That
,
for
weeks
gone
by
,
I
*NL*
had
passed
faces
in
the
streets
which
I
had
thought
like
his
.
That
these
*NL*
likenesses
had
grown
more
numerous
,
as
he
,
coming
over
the
sea
,
had
*NL*
drawn
nearer
.
That
his
wicked
spirit
had
somehow
sent
these
messengers
*NL*
to
mine
,
and
that
now
on
this
stormy
night
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
,
*NL*
and
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crowding
up
with
these
reflections
came
the
reflection
that
I
had
seen
*NL*
him
with
my
childish
eyes
to
be
a
desperately
violent
man
;
that
I
had
*NL*
heard
that
other
convict
reiterate
that
he
had
tried
to
murder
him
;
that
*NL*
I
had
seen
him
down
in
the
ditch
tearing
and
fighting
like
a
wild
*NL*
beast
.
Out
of
such
remembrances
I
brought
into
the
light
of
the
fire
a
*NL*
half-formed
terror
that
it
might
not
be
safe
to
be
shut
up
there
with
*NL*
him
in
the
dead
of
the
wild
solitary
night
.
This
dilated
until
it
filled
*NL*
the
room
,
and
impelled
me
to
take
a
candle
and
go
in
and
look
at
my
*NL*
dreadful
burden
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
rolled
a
handkerchief
round
his
head
,
and
his
face
was
set
and
*NL*
lowering
in
his
sleep
.
But
he
was
asleep
,
and
quietly
too
,
though
he
had
*NL*
a
pistol
lying
on
the
pillow
.
Assured
of
this
,
I
softly
removed
the
key
*NL*
to
the
outside
of
his
door
,
and
turned
it
on
him
before
I
again
sat
down
*NL*
by
the
fire
.
Gradually
I
slipped
from
the
chair
and
lay
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
When
I
awoke
without
having
parted
in
my
sleep
with
the
perception
of
*NL*
my
wretchedness
,
the
clocks
of
the
Eastward
churches
were
striking
five
,
*NL*
the
candles
were
wasted
out
,
the
fire
was
dead
,
and
the
wind
and
rain
*NL*
intensified
the
thick
black
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
THIS
IS
THE
END
OF
THE
SECOND
STAGE
OF
PIP
'S
EXPECTATIONS
.

*NL*
Chapter
XL
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fortunate
for
me
that
I
had
to
take
precautions
to
ensure
-LRB-
so
far
*NL*
as
I
could
-RRB-
the
safety
of
my
dreaded
visitor
;
for
,
this
thought
pressing
*NL*
on
me
when
I
awoke
,
held
other
thoughts
in
a
confused
concourse
at
a
*NL*
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impossibility
of
keeping
him
concealed
in
the
chambers
was
*NL*
self-evident
.
It
could
not
be
done
,
and
the
attempt
to
do
it
would
*NL*
inevitably
engender
suspicion
.
True
,
I
had
no
Avenger
in
my
service
now
,
*NL*
but
I
was
looked
after
by
an
inflammatory
old
female
,
assisted
by
an
*NL*
animated
rag-bag
whom
she
called
her
niece
,
and
to
keep
a
room
secret
*NL*
from
them
would
be
to
invite
curiosity
and
exaggeration
.
They
both
had
*NL*
weak
eyes
,
which
I
had
long
attributed
to
their
chronically
looking
in
*NL*
at
keyholes
,
and
they
were
always
at
hand
when
not
wanted
;
indeed
that
*NL*
was
their
only
reliable
quality
besides
larceny
.
Not
to
get
up
a
mystery
*NL*
with
these
people
,
I
resolved
to
announce
in
the
morning
that
my
uncle
*NL*
had
unexpectedly
come
from
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
course
I
decided
on
while
I
was
yet
groping
about
in
the
darkness
*NL*
for
the
means
of
getting
a
light
.
Not
stumbling
on
the
means
after
all
,
*NL*
I
was
fain
to
go
out
to
the
adjacent
Lodge
and
get
the
watchman
there
to
*NL*
come
with
his
lantern
.
Now
,
in
groping
my
way
down
the
black
staircase
I
*NL*
fell
over
something
,
and
that
something
was
a
man
crouching
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
man
made
no
answer
when
I
asked
him
what
he
did
there
,
but
eluded
*NL*
my
touch
in
silence
,
I
ran
to
the
Lodge
and
urged
the
watchman
to
come
*NL*
quickly
;
telling
him
of
the
incident
on
the
way
back
.
The
wind
being
as
*NL*
fierce
as
ever
,
we
did
not
care
to
endanger
the
light
in
the
lantern
by
*NL*
rekindling
the
extinguished
lamps
on
the
staircase
,
but
we
examined
the
*NL*
staircase
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
and
found
no
one
there
.
It
then
*NL*
occurred
to
me
as
possible
that
the
man
might
have
slipped
into
my
*NL*
rooms
;
so
,
lighting
my
candle
at
the
watchman
's
,
and
leaving
him
*NL*
standing
at
the
door
,
I
examined
them
carefully
,
including
the
room
in
*NL*
which
my
dreaded
guest
lay
asleep
.
All
was
quiet
,
and
assuredly
no
other
*NL*
man
was
in
those
chambers
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
troubled
me
that
there
should
have
been
a
lurker
on
the
stairs
,
on
*NL*
that
night
of
all
nights
in
the
year
,
and
I
asked
the
watchman
,
on
the
*NL*
chance
of
eliciting
some
hopeful
explanation
as
I
handed
him
a
dram
*NL*
at
the
door
,
whether
he
had
admitted
at
his
gate
any
gentleman
who
had
*NL*
perceptibly
been
dining
out
?
Yes
,
he
said
;
at
different
times
of
the
*NL*
night
,
three
.
One
lived
in
Fountain
Court
,
and
the
other
two
lived
in
*NL*
the
Lane
,
and
he
had
seen
them
all
go
home
.
Again
,
the
only
other
man
*NL*
who
dwelt
in
the
house
of
which
my
chambers
formed
a
part
had
been
in
*NL*
the
country
for
some
weeks
,
and
he
certainly
had
not
returned
in
the
*NL*
night
,
because
we
had
seen
his
door
with
his
seal
on
it
as
we
came
*NL*
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
night
being
so
bad
,
sir
,
''
said
the
watchman
,
as
he
gave
me
back
*NL*
my
glass
,
``
uncommon
few
have
come
in
at
my
gate
.
Besides
them
three
*NL*
gentlemen
that
I
have
named
,
I
do
n't
call
to
mind
another
since
about
*NL*
eleven
o'clock
,
when
a
stranger
asked
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
uncle
,
''
I
muttered
.
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
him
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Oh
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Likewise
the
person
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Person
with
him
!
''
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
judged
the
person
to
be
with
him
,
''
returned
the
watchman
.
``
The
person
*NL*
stopped
,
when
he
stopped
to
make
inquiry
of
me
,
and
the
person
took
this
*NL*
way
when
he
took
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
watchman
had
not
particularly
noticed
;
he
should
say
a
working
*NL*
person
;
to
the
best
of
his
belief
,
he
had
a
dust-colored
kind
of
clothes
*NL*
on
,
under
a
dark
coat
.
The
watchman
made
more
light
of
the
matter
than
I
*NL*
did
,
and
naturally
;
not
having
my
reason
for
attaching
weight
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
got
rid
of
him
,
which
I
thought
it
well
to
do
without
*NL*
prolonging
explanations
,
my
mind
was
much
troubled
by
these
two
*NL*
circumstances
taken
together
.
Whereas
they
were
easy
of
innocent
*NL*
solution
apart
,
--
as
,
for
instance
,
some
diner
out
or
diner
at
home
,
*NL*
who
had
not
gone
near
this
watchman
's
gate
,
might
have
strayed
to
my
*NL*
staircase
and
dropped
asleep
there
,
--
and
my
nameless
visitor
might
have
*NL*
brought
some
one
with
him
to
show
him
the
way
,
--
still
,
joined
,
they
had
*NL*
an
ugly
look
to
one
as
prone
to
distrust
and
fear
as
the
changes
of
a
*NL*
few
hours
had
made
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lighted
my
fire
,
which
burnt
with
a
raw
pale
flare
at
that
time
of
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
fell
into
a
doze
before
it
.
I
seemed
to
have
been
dozing
a
*NL*
whole
night
when
the
clocks
struck
six
.
As
there
was
full
an
hour
and
*NL*
a
half
between
me
and
daylight
,
I
dozed
again
;
now
,
waking
up
uneasily
,
*NL*
with
prolix
conversations
about
nothing
,
in
my
ears
;
now
,
making
thunder
*NL*
of
the
wind
in
the
chimney
;
at
length
,
falling
off
into
a
profound
sleep
*NL*
from
which
the
daylight
woke
me
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
I
had
never
been
able
to
consider
my
own
situation
,
nor
*NL*
could
I
do
so
yet
.
I
had
not
the
power
to
attend
to
it
.
I
was
greatly
*NL*
dejected
and
distressed
,
but
in
an
incoherent
wholesale
sort
of
way
.
*NL*
As
to
forming
any
plan
for
the
future
,
I
could
as
soon
have
formed
an
*NL*
elephant
.
When
I
opened
the
shutters
and
looked
out
at
the
wet
wild
*NL*
morning
,
all
of
a
leaden
hue
;
when
I
walked
from
room
to
room
;
when
I
*NL*
sat
down
again
shivering
,
before
the
fire
,
waiting
for
my
laundress
to
*NL*
appear
;
I
thought
how
miserable
I
was
,
but
hardly
knew
why
,
or
how
long
*NL*
I
had
been
so
,
or
on
what
day
of
the
week
I
made
the
reflection
,
or
even
*NL*
who
I
was
that
made
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
the
old
woman
and
the
niece
came
in
,
--
the
latter
with
a
head
*NL*
not
easily
distinguishable
from
her
dusty
broom
,
--
and
testified
surprise
*NL*
at
sight
of
me
and
the
fire
.
To
whom
I
imparted
how
my
uncle
had
come
in
*NL*
the
night
and
was
then
asleep
,
and
how
the
breakfast
preparations
were
*NL*
to
be
modified
accordingly
.
Then
I
washed
and
dressed
while
they
knocked
*NL*
the
furniture
about
and
made
a
dust
;
and
so
,
in
a
sort
of
dream
*NL*
or
sleep-waking
,
I
found
myself
sitting
by
the
fire
again
,
waiting
*NL*
for
--
Him
--
to
come
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
,
his
door
opened
and
he
came
out
.
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
*NL*
bear
the
sight
of
him
,
and
I
thought
he
had
a
worse
look
by
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
even
know
,
''
said
I
,
speaking
low
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
*NL*
table
,
``
by
what
name
to
call
you
.
I
have
given
out
that
you
are
my
*NL*
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
dear
boy
!
Call
me
uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
assumed
some
name
,
I
suppose
,
on
board
ship
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
boy
.
I
took
the
name
of
Provis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
keep
that
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
dear
boy
,
it
's
as
good
as
another
,
--
unless
you
'd
like
*NL*
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
real
name
?
''
I
asked
him
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Magwitch
,
''
he
answered
,
in
the
same
tone
;
``
chrisen
'd
Abel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
brought
up
to
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
warmint
,
dear
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
quite
seriously
,
and
used
the
word
as
if
it
denoted
some
*NL*
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
came
into
the
Temple
last
night
--
''
said
I
,
pausing
to
wonder
*NL*
whether
that
could
really
have
been
last
night
,
which
seemed
so
long
*NL*
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
came
in
at
the
gate
and
asked
the
watchman
the
way
here
,
had
*NL*
you
any
one
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
?
No
,
dear
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
was
some
one
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
take
particular
notice
,
''
he
said
,
dubiously
,
``
not
knowing
the
*NL*
ways
of
the
place
.
But
I
think
there
was
a
person
,
too
,
come
in
alonger
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
known
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
!
''
said
he
,
giving
his
neck
a
jerk
with
his
forefinger
that
*NL*
made
me
turn
hot
and
sick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
known
in
London
,
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
over
and
above
,
dear
boy
.
I
was
in
the
provinces
mostly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
--
tried
--
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
time
?
''
said
he
,
with
a
sharp
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
.
``
First
knowed
Mr.
Jaggers
that
way
.
Jaggers
was
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
my
lips
to
ask
him
what
he
was
tried
for
,
but
he
took
up
*NL*
a
knife
,
gave
it
a
flourish
,
and
with
the
words
,
``
And
what
I
done
is
*NL*
worked
out
and
paid
for
!
''
fell
to
at
his
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ate
in
a
ravenous
way
that
was
very
disagreeable
,
and
all
his
actions
*NL*
were
uncouth
,
noisy
,
and
greedy
.
Some
of
his
teeth
had
failed
him
since
*NL*
I
saw
him
eat
on
the
marshes
,
and
as
he
turned
his
food
in
his
mouth
,
*NL*
and
turned
his
head
sideways
to
bring
his
strongest
fangs
to
bear
upon
*NL*
it
,
he
looked
terribly
like
a
hungry
old
dog
.
If
I
had
begun
with
any
*NL*
appetite
,
he
would
have
taken
it
away
,
and
I
should
have
sat
much
as
*NL*
I
did
,
--
repelled
from
him
by
an
insurmountable
aversion
,
and
gloomily
*NL*
looking
at
the
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
heavy
grubber
,
dear
boy
,
''
he
said
,
as
a
polite
kind
of
apology
*NL*
when
he
made
an
end
of
his
meal
,
``
but
I
always
was
.
If
it
had
been
in
*NL*
my
constitution
to
be
a
lighter
grubber
,
I
might
ha
'
got
into
lighter
*NL*
trouble
.
Similarly
,
I
must
have
my
smoke
.
When
I
was
first
hired
out
as
*NL*
shepherd
t
`
other
side
the
world
,
it
's
my
belief
I
should
ha
'
turned
into
*NL*
a
molloncolly-mad
sheep
myself
,
if
I
had
n't
a
had
my
smoke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
so
,
he
got
up
from
table
,
and
putting
his
hand
into
the
*NL*
breast
of
the
pea-coat
he
wore
,
brought
out
a
short
black
pipe
,
and
a
*NL*
handful
of
loose
tobacco
of
the
kind
that
is
called
Negro-head
.
Having
*NL*
filled
his
pipe
,
he
put
the
surplus
tobacco
back
again
,
as
if
his
pocket
*NL*
were
a
drawer
.
Then
,
he
took
a
live
coal
from
the
fire
with
the
tongs
,
*NL*
and
lighted
his
pipe
at
it
,
and
then
turned
round
on
the
hearth-rug
with
*NL*
his
back
to
the
fire
,
and
went
through
his
favorite
action
of
holding
*NL*
out
both
his
hands
for
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
,
''
said
he
,
dandling
my
hands
up
and
down
in
his
,
as
he
puffed
*NL*
at
his
pipe
,
--
``
and
this
is
the
gentleman
what
I
made

The
real
genuine
*NL*

does
me
good

look

All
I
stip
`

,
is

to
*NL*
stand
by
and
look
at
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
released
my
hands
as
soon
as
I
could
,
and
found
that
I
was
beginning
*NL*
slowly
to
settle
down
to
the
contemplation
of
my
condition
.
What
I
was
*NL*
chained
to
,
and
how
heavily
,
became
intelligible
to
me
,
as
I
heard
his
*NL*
hoarse
voice
,
and
sat
looking
up
at
his
furrowed
bald
head
with
its
iron
*NL*
gray
hair
at
the
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
n't

to

of
shoes

Pip
;

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
great
thick
pocket-book
,
bursting
with
*NL*
papers
,
and
tossed
it
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
he
wound
up
,
looking
round
the
room
and
snapping
his
fingers
once
with
*NL*
a
loud
snap
,
``

said
I
,
almost
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
and
dislike
,
``

*NL*
``

said
he

laying
his

on
my
arm
in
a
suddenly

altered
and
subdued
manner
;
``

half
groaning

*NL*
*NL*
``

in

*NL*
Some
sense
of
the
grimly-ludicrous
moved
me
to
a
fretful
laugh
,
as
I
*NL*
replied
,
``

*NL*
``
Well

he
returned
,

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
he
,
taking
his
black
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
and
dropping
*NL*
his
jaw
as
he
stared
at
me
.
``

I.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear

he
returned
,

your

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
take

''
said
I
,
``
but
you
were
very
serious
last

swore

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
I
swear
it
is
Death

''
said
he
,
putting
his
pipe
back
in
his
*NL*
mouth
,
``
and
Death
by
the
rope
,
in
the
open
street
not

from

and
*NL*
it
's
serious
that
you
should
fully

's

Pip

I

here

because
I
've
meant

As

I
'm
a

has

I

And
now
let
me
have
a
look
at
my
gentleman
agen

''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
,
he
took
me
by
both
hands
and
surveyed
me
with
an
air
of
*NL*
admiring
proprietorship
:
smoking
with
great
complacency
all
the
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
to
me
that
I
could
do
no
better
than
secure
him
some
*NL*
quiet
lodging
hard
by
,
of
which
he
might
take
possession
when
Herbert
*NL*
returned
:
whom
I
expected
in
two
or
three
days
.
That
the
secret
must
*NL*
be
confided
to
Herbert
as
a
matter
of
unavoidable
necessity
,
even
if
I
*NL*
could
have
put
the
immense
relief
I
should
derive
from
sharing
it
with
*NL*
him
out
of
the
question
,
was
plain
to
me
.
But
it
was
by
no
means
so
*NL*
plain
to
Mr.
Provis
-LRB-
I
resolved
to
call
him
by
that
name
-RRB-
,
who
reserved
*NL*
his
consent
to
Herbert
's
participation
until
he
should
have
seen
him
*NL*
and
formed
a
favorable
judgment
of
his
physiognomy
.
``
And
even
then
,
dear
*NL*
boy
,
''
said
he
,
pulling
a
greasy
little
clasped
black
Testament
out
of
*NL*
his
pocket
,
``
we
'll
have
him
on
his
oath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
state
that
my
terrible
patron
carried
this
little
black
book
about
*NL*
the
world
solely
to
swear
people
on
in
cases
of
emergency
,
would
be
to
*NL*
state
what
I
never
quite
established
;
but
this
I
can
say
,
that
I
never
*NL*
knew
him
put
it
to
any
other
use
.
The
book
itself
had
the
appearance
of
*NL*
having
been
stolen
from
some
court
of
justice
,
and
perhaps
his
knowledge
*NL*
of
its
antecedents
,
combined
with
his
own
experience
in
that
wise
,
gave
*NL*
him
a
reliance
on
its
powers
as
a
sort
of
legal
spell
or
charm
.
On
this
*NL*
first
occasion
of
his
producing
it
,
I
recalled
how
he
had
made
me
swear
*NL*
fidelity
in
the
churchyard
long
ago
,
and
how
he
had
described
himself
*NL*
last
night
as
always
swearing
to
his
resolutions
in
his
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
at
present
dressed
in
a
seafaring
slop
suit
,
in
which
he
*NL*
looked
as
if
he
had
some
parrots
and
cigars
to
dispose
of
,
I
next
*NL*
discussed
with
him
what
dress
he
should
wear
.
He
cherished
an
*NL*
extraordinary
belief
in
the
virtues
of
``
shorts
''
as
a
disguise
,
and
had
*NL*
in
his
own
mind
sketched
a
dress
for
himself
that
would
have
made
*NL*
him
something
between
a
dean
and
a
dentist
.
It
was
with
considerable
*NL*
difficulty
that
I
won
him
over
to
the
assumption
of
a
dress
more
like
a
*NL*
prosperous
farmer
's
;
and
we
arranged
that
he
should
cut
his
hair
close
,
*NL*
and
wear
a
little
powder
.
Lastly
,
as
he
had
not
yet
been
seen
by
the
*NL*
laundress
or
her
niece
,
he
was
to
keep
himself
out
of
their
view
until
*NL*
his
change
of
dress
was
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
seem
a
simple
matter
to
decide
on
these
precautions
;
but
in
my
*NL*
dazed
,
not
to
say
distracted
,
state
,
it
took
so
long
,
that
I
did
not
*NL*
get
out
to
further
them
until
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon
.
He
was
to
*NL*
remain
shut
up
in
the
chambers
while
I
was
gone
,
and
was
on
no
account
*NL*
to
open
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
being
to
my
knowledge
a
respectable
lodging-house
in
Essex
Street
,
*NL*
the
back
of
which
looked
into
the
Temple
,
and
was
almost
within
hail
of
*NL*
my
windows
,
I
first
of
all
repaired
to
that
house
,
and
was
so
fortunate
*NL*
as
to
secure
the
second
floor
for
my
uncle
,
Mr.
Provis
.
I
then
went
from
*NL*
shop
to
shop
,
making
such
purchases
as
were
necessary
to
the
change
in
*NL*
his
appearance
.
This
business
transacted
,
I
turned
my
face
,
on
my
own
*NL*
account
,
to
Little
Britain
.
Mr.
Jaggers
was
at
his
desk
,
but
,
seeing
me
*NL*
enter
,
got
up
immediately
and
stood
before
his
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Pip
,
''
said
he
,
``
be
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
sir
,
''
I
returned
.
For
,
coming
along
I
had
thought
well
of
what
*NL*
I
was
going
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
commit
yourself
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
and
do
n't
commit
any
one
.
*NL*
You
understand
--
any
one
.
Do
n't
tell
me
anything
:
I
do
n't
want
to
know
*NL*
anything
;
I
am
not
curious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
saw
that
he
knew
the
man
was
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
merely
want
,
Mr.
Jaggers
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
assure
myself
that
what
I
have
*NL*
been
told
is
true
.
I
have
no
hope
of
its
being
untrue
,
but
at
least
I
*NL*
may
verify
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
nodded
.
``
But
did
you
say
`
told
'
or
`
informed
'
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
me
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
not
looking
at
me
,
but
looking
in
*NL*
a
listening
way
at
the
floor
.
``
Told
would
seem
to
imply
verbal
*NL*
communication

n't

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
I
have
been

long
unknown
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

Mr.

I.

*NL*
``

Mr.

always
supposed

*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
Mr.
Jaggers
,
turning
his
eyes
upon
*NL*
me
coolly

and
taking
a
bite
at
his
forefinger
,

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
pleaded
with
a
downcast
heart

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
particle

said
Mr.

shaking
his
head

gathering
up
his
skirts

*NL*
``
I
have
no

said
I
,
with
a
sigh

after
standing
silent
for
*NL*
a
little
while
.
``
I
have
verified
my
information

's
an
end

*NL*
``

said
Mr.

There

departure

that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
communicated

in

when
he
first
wrote
to

the
caution
that
he
must
not
expect
me
ever
to
*NL*
deviate
from
the
strict
line
of
fact

I
also
communicated
to
him
another
*NL*
caution

appeared
to
me
to
have
obscurely
hinted
in
his
letter
at
*NL*
some
distant
idea
he
had
of
seeing
you

I
cautioned

him

I
must
hear
no
more

;
that
he
was
not

likely
to
*NL*
obtain
a
pardon

that
he
was
expatriated
for
the
term

life

that

presenting

country
would
be
an
act
of
*NL*
felony

rendering
him
liable
to
the
extreme
penalty

I
gave
*NL*
Magwitch
that
caution

said
Mr.

looking
hard
at
me

I
wrote

it

He
guided
himself
by
it

no

``
No

I.

still
looking

hard
at

*NL*
*NL*
We
shook
hands
,
and
he
looked
hard
at
me
as
long
as
he
could
see
me
.
I
*NL*
turned
at
the
door
,
and
he
was
still
looking
hard
at
me
,
while
the
two
*NL*
vile
casts
on
the
shelf
seemed
to
be
trying
to
get
their
eyelids
open
,
*NL*
and
to
force
out
of
their
swollen
throats
,
``
O
,
what
a
man
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
was
out
,
and
though
he
had
been
at
his
desk
he
could
have
done
*NL*
nothing
for
me
.
I
went
straight
back
to
the
Temple
,
where
I
found
*NL*
the
terrible
Provis
drinking
rum
and
water
and
smoking
negro-head
,
in
*NL*
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
clothes
I
had
ordered
all
came
home
,
and
he
put
them
on
.
*NL*
Whatever
he
put
on
,
became
him
less
-LRB-
it
dismally
seemed
to
me
-RRB-
than
what
*NL*
he
had
worn
before
.
To
my
thinking
,
there
was
something
in
him
that
made
*NL*
it
hopeless
to
attempt
to
disguise
him
.
The
more
I
dressed
him
and
the
*NL*
better
I
dressed
him
,
the
more
he
looked
like
the
slouching
fugitive
on
*NL*
the
marshes
.
This
effect
on
my
anxious
fancy
was
partly
referable
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
to
his
old
face
and
manner
growing
more
familiar
to
me
;
but
I
*NL*
believe
too
that
he
dragged
one
of
his
legs
as
if
there
were
still
a
*NL*
weight
of
iron
on
it
,
and
that
from
head
to
foot
there
was
Convict
in
*NL*
the
very
grain
of
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
influences
of
his
solitary
hut-life
were
upon
him
besides
,
and
*NL*
gave
him
a
savage
air
that
no
dress
could
tame
;
added
to
these
were
the
*NL*
influences
of
his
subsequent
branded
life
among
men
,
and
,
crowning
all
,
*NL*
his
consciousness
that
he
was
dodging
and
hiding
now
.
In
all
his
ways
of
*NL*
sitting
and
standing
,
and
eating
and
drinking
,
--
of
brooding
about
in
a
*NL*
high-shouldered
reluctant
style
,
--
of
taking
out
his
great
horn-handled
*NL*
jackknife
and
wiping
it
on
his
legs
and
cutting
his
food
,
--
of
*NL*
lifting
light
glasses
and
cups
to
his
lips
,
as
if
they
were
clumsy
*NL*
pannikins
,
--
of
chopping
a
wedge
off
his
bread
,
and
soaking
up
with
it
*NL*
the
last
fragments
of
gravy
round
and
round
his
plate
,
as
if
to
make
the
*NL*
most
of
an
allowance
,
and
then
drying
his
finger-ends
on
it
,
and
then
*NL*
swallowing
it
,
--
in
these
ways
and
a
thousand
other
small
nameless
*NL*
instances
arising
every
minute
in
the
day
,
there
was
Prisoner
,
Felon
,
*NL*
Bondsman
,
plain
as
plain
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
his
own
idea
to
wear
that
touch
of
powder
,
and
I
had
*NL*
conceded
the
powder
after
overcoming
the
shorts
.
But
I
can
compare
the
*NL*
effect
of
it
,
when
on
,
to
nothing
but
the
probable
effect
of
rouge
upon
*NL*
the
dead
;
so
awful
was
the
manner
in
which
everything
in
him
that
it
was
*NL*
most
desirable
to
repress
,
started
through
that
thin
layer
of
pretence
,
*NL*
and
seemed
to
come
blazing
out
at
the
crown
of
his
head
.
It
was
*NL*
abandoned
as
soon
as
tried
,
and
he
wore
his
grizzled
hair
cut
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
Words
can
not
tell
what
a
sense
I
had
,
at
the
same
time
,
of
the
dreadful
*NL*
mystery
that
he
was
to
me
.
When
he
fell
asleep
of
an
evening
,
with
his
*NL*
knotted
hands
clenching
the
sides
of
the
easy-chair
,
and
his
bald
head
*NL*
tattooed
with
deep
wrinkles
falling
forward
on
his
breast
,
I
would
sit
*NL*
and
look
at
him
,
wondering
what
he
had
done
,
and
loading
him
with
all
*NL*
the
crimes
in
the
Calendar
,
until
the
impulse
was
powerful
on
me
to
*NL*
start
up
and
fly
from
him
.
Every
hour
so
increased
my
abhorrence
of
*NL*
him
,
that
I
even
think
I
might
have
yielded
to
this
impulse
in
the
first
*NL*
agonies
of
being
so
haunted
,
notwithstanding
all
he
had
done
for
me
and
*NL*
the
risk
he
ran
,
but
for
the
knowledge
that
Herbert
must
soon
come
back
.
*NL*
Once
,
I
actually
did
start
out
of
bed
in
the
night
,
and
begin
to
dress
*NL*
myself
in
my
worst
clothes
,
hurriedly
intending
to
leave
him
there
with
*NL*
everything
else
I
possessed
,
and
enlist
for
India
as
a
private
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
doubt
if
a
ghost
could
have
been
more
terrible
to
me
,
up
in
those
*NL*
lonely
rooms
in
the
long
evenings
and
long
nights
,
with
the
wind
and
the
*NL*
rain
always
rushing
by
.
A
ghost
could
not
have
been
taken
and
hanged
on
*NL*
my
account
,
and
the
consideration
that
he
could
be
,
and
the
dread
that
*NL*
he
would
be
,
were
no
small
addition
to
my
horrors
.
When
he
was
not
*NL*
asleep
,
or
playing
a
complicated
kind
of
Patience
with
a
ragged
pack
of
*NL*
cards
of
his
own
,
--
a
game
that
I
never
saw
before
or
since
,
and
in
which
*NL*
he
recorded
his
winnings
by
sticking
his
jackknife
into
the
table
,
--
when
*NL*
he
was
not
engaged
in
either
of
these
pursuits
,
he
would
ask
me
to
*NL*
read
to
him
,
--
``
Foreign
language
,
dear
boy
!
''
While
I
complied
,
he
,
not
*NL*
comprehending
a
single
word
,
would
stand
before
the
fire
surveying
me
*NL*
with
the
air
of
an
Exhibitor
,
and
I
would
see
him
,
between
the
fingers
*NL*
of
the
hand
with
which
I
shaded
my
face
,
appealing
in
dumb
show
to
*NL*
the
furniture
to
take
notice
of
my
proficiency
.
The
imaginary
student
*NL*
pursued
by
the
misshapen
creature
he
had
impiously
made
,
was
not
more
*NL*
wretched
than
I
,
pursued
by
the
creature
who
had
made
me
,
and
recoiling
*NL*
from
him
with
a
stronger
repulsion
,
the
more
he
admired
me
and
the
*NL*
fonder
he
was
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
written
of
,
I
am
sensible
,
as
if
it
had
lasted
a
year
.
It
lasted
*NL*
about
five
days
.
Expecting
Herbert
all
the
time
,
I
dared
not
go
out
,
*NL*
except
when
I
took
Provis
for
an
airing
after
dark
.
At
length
,
one
*NL*
evening
when
dinner
was
over
and
I
had
dropped
into
a
slumber
quite
*NL*
worn
out
,
--
for
my
nights
had
been
agitated
and
my
rest
broken
by
fearful
*NL*
dreams
,
--
I
was
roused
by
the
welcome
footstep
on
the
staircase
.
Provis
,
*NL*
who
had
been
asleep
too
,
staggered
up
at
the
noise
I
made
,
and
in
an
*NL*
instant
I
saw
his
jackknife
shining
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quiet
!
It
's
Herbert
!
''
I
said
;
and
Herbert
came
bursting
in
,
with
the
*NL*
airy
freshness
of
six
hundred
miles
of
France
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handel
,
my
dear
fellow
,
how
are
you
,
and
again
how
are
you
,
and
again
*NL*
how
are
you
?
I
seem
to
have
been
gone
a
twelvemonth
!
Why
,
so
I
must
have
*NL*
been
,
for
you
have
grown
quite
thin
and
pale
!
Handel
,
my
--
Halloa
!
I
beg
*NL*
your
pardon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
stopped
in
his
running
on
and
in
his
shaking
hands
with
me
,
by
*NL*
seeing
Provis
.
Provis
,
regarding
him
with
a
fixed
attention
,
was
slowly
*NL*
putting
up
his
jackknife
,
and
groping
in
another
pocket
for
something
*NL*
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Herbert
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
said
I
,
shutting
the
double
doors
,
while
*NL*
Herbert
stood
staring
and
wondering
,
``
something
very
strange
has
*NL*
happened
.
This
is
--
a
visitor
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
dear
boy
!
''
said
Provis
coming
forward
,
with
his
little
*NL*
clasped
black
book
,
and
then
addressing
himself
to
Herbert
.
``
Take
it
in
*NL*
your
right
hand
.
Lord
strike
you
dead
on
the
spot
,
if
ever
you
split
in
*NL*
any
way
sumever
!
Kiss
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
so
,
as
he
wishes
it
,
''
I
said
to
Herbert
.
So
,
Herbert
,
looking
at
*NL*
me
with
a
friendly
uneasiness
and
amazement
,
complied
,
and
Provis
*NL*
immediately
shaking
hands
with
him
,
said
,
``
Now
you
're
on
your
oath
,
you
*NL*
know
.
And
never
believe
me
on
mine
,
if
Pip
sha
n't
make
a
gentleman
on
*NL*
you
!

Chapter
XLI
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
should
I
attempt
to
describe
the
astonishment
and
disquiet
*NL*
of
Herbert
,
when
he
and
I
and
Provis
sat
down
before
the
fire
,
and
I
*NL*
recounted
the
whole
of
the
secret
.
Enough
,
that
I
saw
my
own
feelings
*NL*
reflected
in
Herbert
's
face
,
and
not
least
among
them
,
my
repugnance
*NL*
towards
the
man
who
had
done
so
much
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
alone
have
set
a
division
between
that
man
and
us
,
if
there
*NL*
had
been
no
other
dividing
circumstance
,
was
his
triumph
in
my
story
.
*NL*
Saving
his
troublesome
sense
of
having
been
``
low
''
on
one
occasion
since
*NL*
his
return
,
--
on
which
point
he
began
to
hold
forth
to
Herbert
,
the
*NL*
moment
my
revelation
was
finished
,
--
he
had
no
perception
of
the
*NL*
possibility
of
my
finding
any
fault
with
my
good
fortune
.
His
boast
that
*NL*
he
had
made
me
a
gentleman
,
and
that
he
had
come
to
see
me
support
the
*NL*
character
on
his
ample
resources
,
was
made
for
me
quite
as
much
as
for
*NL*
himself
.
And
that
it
was
a
highly
agreeable
boast
to
both
of
us
,
*NL*
and
that
we
must
both
be
very
proud
of
it
,
was
a
conclusion
quite
*NL*
established
in
his
own
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
,
look
`
ee
here
,
Pip
's
comrade
,
''
he
said
to
Herbert
,
after
having
*NL*
discoursed
for
some
time
,
``
I
know
very
well
that
once
since
I
come
*NL*
back
--
for
half
a
minute
--
I
've
been
low
.
I
said
to
Pip
,
I
knowed
as
I
had
*NL*
been
low
.
But
do
n't
you
fret
yourself
on
that
score
.
I
ai
n't
made
Pip
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
Pip
ai
n't
a
going
to
make
you
a
gentleman
,
not
fur
me
not
*NL*
to
know
what
's
due
to
ye
both
.
Dear
boy
,
and
Pip
's
comrade
,
you
two
may
*NL*
count
upon
me
always
having
a
gen-teel
muzzle
on
.
Muzzled
I
have
been
*NL*
since
that
half
a
minute
when
I
was
betrayed
into
lowness
,
muzzled
I
am
*NL*
at
the
present
time
,
muzzled
I
ever
will
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
said
,
``
Certainly
,
''
but
looked
as
if
there
were
no
specific
*NL*
consolation
in
this
,
and
remained
perplexed
and
dismayed
.
We
were
*NL*
anxious
for
the
time
when
he
would
go
to
his
lodging
and
leave
us
*NL*
together
,
but
he
was
evidently
jealous
of
leaving
us
together
,
and
sat
*NL*
late
.
It
was
midnight
before
I
took
him
round
to
Essex
Street
,
and
*NL*
saw
him
safely
in
at
his
own
dark
door
.
When
it
closed
upon
him
,
I
*NL*
experienced
the
first
moment
of
relief
I
had
known
since
the
night
of
*NL*
his
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
quite
free
from
an
uneasy
remembrance
of
the
man
on
the
stairs
,
*NL*
I
had
always
looked
about
me
in
taking
my
guest
out
after
dark
,
and
in
*NL*
bringing
him
back
;
and
I
looked
about
me
now
.
Difficult
as
it
is
in
a
*NL*
large
city
to
avoid
the
suspicion
of
being
watched
,
when
the
mind
is
*NL*
conscious
of
danger
in
that
regard
,
I
could
not
persuade
myself
that
any
*NL*
of
the
people
within
sight
cared
about
my
movements
.
The
few
who
were
*NL*
passing
passed
on
their
several
ways
,
and
the
street
was
empty
when
I
*NL*
turned
back
into
the
Temple
.
Nobody
had
come
out
at
the
gate
with
us
,
*NL*
nobody
went
in
at
the
gate
with
me
.
As
I
crossed
by
the
fountain
,
I
saw
*NL*
his
lighted
back
windows
looking
bright
and
quiet
,
and
,
when
I
stood
for
*NL*
a
few
moments
in
the
doorway
of
the
building
where
I
lived
,
before
going
*NL*
up
the
stairs
,
Garden
Court
was
as
still
and
lifeless
as
the
staircase
*NL*
was
when
I
ascended
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
received
me
with
open
arms
,
and
I
had
never
felt
before
so
*NL*
blessedly
what
it
is
to
have
a
friend
.
When
he
had
spoken
some
sound
*NL*
words
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
,
we
sat
down
to
consider
the
*NL*
question
,
What
was
to
be
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
chair
that
Provis
had
occupied
still
remaining
where
it
had
*NL*
stood
,
--
for
he
had
a
barrack
way
with
him
of
hanging
about
one
spot
,
in
*NL*
one
unsettled
manner
,
and
going
through
one
round
of
observances
with
*NL*
his
pipe
and
his
negro-head
and
his
jackknife
and
his
pack
of
cards
,
*NL*
and
what
not
,
as
if
it
were
all
put
down
for
him
on
a
slate
,
--
I
say
his
*NL*
chair
remaining
where
it
had
stood
,
Herbert
unconsciously
took
it
,
but
*NL*
next
moment
started
out
of
it
,
pushed
it
away
,
and
took
another
.
He
had
*NL*
no
occasion
to
say
after
that
that
he
had
conceived
an
aversion
for
my
*NL*
patron
,
neither
had
I
occasion
to
confess
my
own
.
We
interchanged
that
*NL*
confidence
without
shaping
a
syllable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
''
said
I
to
Herbert
,
when
he
was
safe
in
another
chair
,
--
``
what
is
*NL*
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
dear
Handel
,
''
he
replied
,
holding
his
head
,
``
I
am
too
stunned
*NL*
to
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
was
I
,
Herbert
,
when
the
blow
first
fell
.
Still
,
something
must
be
*NL*
done
.
He
is
intent
upon
various
new
expenses
,
--
horses
,
and
carriages
,
*NL*
and
lavish
appearances
of
all
kinds
.
He
must
be
stopped
somehow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
you
ca
n't
accept
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
?
''
I
interposed
,
as
Herbert
paused
.
``
Think
of
him
!
Look
at
*NL*
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
involuntary
shudder
passed
over
both
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
am
afraid
the
dreadful
truth
is
,
Herbert
,
that
he
is
attached
to
*NL*
me
,
strongly
attached
to
me
.
Was
there
ever
such
a
fate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
dear
Handel
,
''
Herbert
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
I
,
``
after
all
,
stopping
short
here
,
never
taking
another
*NL*
penny
from
him
,
think
what
I
owe
him
already
!
Then
again
:
I
am
heavily
*NL*
in
debt
,
--
very
heavily
for
me
,
who
have
now
no
expectations
,
--
and
I
have
*NL*
been
bred
to
no
calling
,
and
I
am
fit
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
well
!
''
Herbert
remonstrated
.
``
Do
n't
say
fit
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
fit
for
?
I
know
only
one
thing
that
I
am
fit
for
,
and
that
*NL*
is
,
to
go
for
a
soldier
.
And
I
might
have
gone
,
my
dear
Herbert
,
but
for
*NL*
the
prospect
of
taking
counsel
with
your
friendship
and
affection
.

*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
broke
down
there
:
and
of
course
Herbert
,
beyond
seizing
a
*NL*
warm
grip
of
my
hand
,
pretended
not
to
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
my
dear
Handel
,
''
said
he
presently
,
``
soldiering
wo
n't
do

If
*NL*
you
were
to
renounce
this
patronage
and
these
favors
,
I
suppose
you
*NL*
would
do
so
with
some
faint
hope
of
one
day
repaying
what
you
have
*NL*
already
had
.
Not
very
strong
,
that
hope
,
if
you
went
soldiering
!
*NL*
Besides
,
it
's
absurd
.
You
would
be
infinitely
better
in
Clarriker
's
*NL*
house
,
small
as
it
is
.
I
am
working
up
towards
a
partnership
,
you
know

*NL*
*NL*
Poor
fellow
!
He
little
suspected
with
whose
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
is
another
question
,
''
said
Herbert
.
``
This
is
an
ignorant
,
*NL*
determined
man
,
who
has
long
had
one
fixed
idea
.
More
than
that
,
he
*NL*
seems
to
me
-LRB-
I
may
misjudge
him
-RRB-
to
be
a
man
of
a
desperate
and
fierce
*NL*
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
he
is
,
''
I
returned
.
``
Let
me
tell
you
what
evidence
I
have
seen
*NL*
of
it
.
''
And
I
told
him
what
I
had
not
mentioned
in
my
narrative
,
of
that
*NL*
encounter
with
the
other
convict
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
then
,
''
said
Herbert
;
``
think
of
this
!
He
comes
here
at
the
peril
*NL*
of
his
life
,
for
the
realization
of
his
fixed
idea
.
In
the
moment
of
*NL*
realization
,
after
all
his
toil
and
waiting
,
you
cut
the
ground
from
*NL*
under
his
feet
,
destroy
his
idea
,
and
make
his
gains
worthless
to
him
.
*NL*
Do
you
see
nothing
that
he
might
do
,
under
the
disappointment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
it
,
Herbert
,
and
dreamed
of
it
,
ever
since
the
fatal
night
*NL*
of
his
arrival
.
Nothing
has
been
in
my
thoughts
so
distinctly
as
his
*NL*
putting
himself
in
the
way
of
being
taken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
may
rely
upon
it
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
that
there
would
be
great
*NL*
danger
of
his
doing
it
.
That
is
his
power
over
you
as
long
as
he
remains
*NL*
in
England
,
and
that
would
be
his
reckless
course
if
you
forsook
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
struck
by
the
horror
of
this
idea
,
which
had
weighed
upon
*NL*
me
from
the
first
,
and
the
working
out
of
which
would
make
me
regard
*NL*
myself
,
in
some
sort
,
as
his
murderer
,
that
I
could
not
rest
in
my
*NL*
chair
,
but
began
pacing
to
and
fro
.
I
said
to
Herbert
,
meanwhile
,
that
*NL*
even
if
Provis
were
recognized
and
taken
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
I
should
*NL*
be
wretched
as
the
cause
,
however
innocently
.
Yes
;
even
though
I
was
so
*NL*
wretched
in
having
him
at
large
and
near
me
,
and
even
though
I
would
*NL*
far
rather
have
worked
at
the
forge
all
the
days
of
my
life
than
I
would
*NL*
ever
have
come
to
this
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
staving
off
the
question
,
What
was
to
be
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
and
the
main
thing
to
be
done
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
is
to
get
him
*NL*
out
of
England
.
You
will
have
to
go
with
him
,
and
then
he
may
be
induced
*NL*
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
get
him
where
I
will
,
could
I
prevent
his
coming
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
Handel
,
is
it
not
obvious
that
with
Newgate
in
the
next
street
,
*NL*
there
must
be
far
greater
hazard
in
your
breaking
your
mind
to
him
and
*NL*
making
him
reckless
,
here
,
than
elsewhere
?
If
a
pretext
to
get
him
away
*NL*
could
be
made
out
of
that
other
convict
,
or
out
of
anything
else
in
his
*NL*
life

now

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
again

said
I
,
stopping
before
Herbert
,
with
my
open
hands
held
*NL*
out
,
as
if
they
contained
the
desperation
of
the
case
.
``
I
know
nothing
*NL*
of
his

It
has
almost
made
me
mad
to
sit
here
of
a
night

see
*NL*
him
before
me
,
so
bound
up
with
my
fortunes
and
misfortunes
,
and
yet
so
*NL*
unknown
to

the
miserable
wretch
who
terrified
me
two
days
*NL*
in

childhood

*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
got
up
,
and
linked
his
arm
in
mine
,
and
we
slowly
walked
to
and
*NL*
fro
together
,
studying
the
carpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handel

''
said
Herbert
,
stopping
,
``

feel
convinced
that
you
can
take
*NL*
no
further
benefits
from
him
;
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fully

Surely
you

*NL*

*NL*
``

you
ask
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you

that
you
must
save

away

Then
you
must
get
him
out

stir

extricate

That

extricate

we
'll
see
it
out
together

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
comfort
to
shake
hands
upon
it
,
and
walk
up
and
down
again
,
*NL*
with
only
that
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Herbert

''
said
I
,
``
with
reference
to
gaining
some
knowledge
of
*NL*
his
history

There
is
but
one
way
that
I
know

I
must
ask
him
point
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Ask
him

said
Herbert
,
``
when

sit
at
breakfast
in
the
morning

*NL*
For
he
had
said
,
on
taking
leave
of
Herbert
,
that
he
would
come
to
*NL*
breakfast
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
project
formed
,
we
went
to
bed
.
I
had
the
wildest
dreams
*NL*
concerning
him
,
and
woke
unrefreshed
;
I
woke
,
too
,
to
recover
the
fear
*NL*
which
I
had
lost
in
the
night
,
of
his
being
found
out
as
a
returned
*NL*
transport
.
Waking
,
I
never
lost
that
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
round
at
the
appointed
time
,
took
out
his
jackknife
,
and
sat
*NL*
down
to
his
meal
.
He
was
full
of
plans
``
for
his
gentleman
's
coming
out
*NL*
strong
,
and
like
a
gentleman
,
''
and
urged
me
to
begin
speedily
upon
*NL*
the
pocket-book
which
he
had
left
in
my
possession
.
He
considered
the
*NL*
chambers
and
his
own
lodging
as
temporary
residences
,
and
advised
me
to
*NL*
look
out
at
once
for
a
``
fashionable
crib
''
near
Hyde
Park
,
in
which
he
*NL*
could
have
``
a
shake-down
.

When
he
had
made
an
end
of
his
breakfast
,
*NL*
and
was
wiping
his
knife
on
his
leg
,
I
said
to
him
,
without
a
word
of
*NL*
preface
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
you
were
gone

I
told

came
up

*NL*

particularly

I
was
able

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
He
took
out
his
black
pipe
and
was
going
to
fill
it
with
negro-head
,
*NL*
when
,
looking
at
the
tangle
of
tobacco
in
his
hand
,
he
seemed
to
think
*NL*
it
might
perplex
the
thread
of
his
narrative

He
put
it
back
again
,
*NL*
stuck
his
pipe
in
a
button-hole
of
his
coat
,
spread
a
hand
on
each
knee
,
*NL*
and
after
turning
an
angry
eye
on
the
fire
for
a
few
silent
moments

*NL*
looked
round
at

said

But
to
give
it
you
short
and
handy
,
I
'll
*NL*
put
it
at
once
into
a
mouthful
of
English

In
jail

out

in

Him

some
more

a
sitting
among

I
went
in

the
landlord
-LRB-
which
had
a
knowledge
of
me

was
a
*NL*

called
him
out

said

Compeyson

*NL*
``
I

next

Compeyson
took

man

pardner
.
And
what
was
Compeyson
's
business
in
which
we
*NL*
was
to
go

Compeyson
's
business
was
the
swindling

forging

stolen

such-like

All

keep

out

get

the
profits
from
and
let
another

in
for

Compeyson
's
business

*NL*
He
'd
no
more
heart
than
a
iron
file
,
he
was
as
cold
as
death
,
and
he
had
*NL*
the
head
of
the
Devil
afore
mentioned

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
another
in
with
Compeyson
,
as
was
called
Arthur
,
--
not
as
*NL*
being
so
chrisen
'd
,
but
as
a
surname
.
He
was
in
a
Decline
,
and
was
a
*NL*
shadow
to
look
at
.
Him
and
Compeyson
had
been
in
a
bad
thing
with
a
*NL*
rich
lady
some
years
afore
,
and
they
'd
made
a
pot
of
money
by
it
;
but
*NL*
Compeyson
betted
and
gamed
,
and
he
'd
have
run
through
the
king
's
taxes
.
*NL*
So
,
Arthur
was
a
dying
,
and
a
dying
poor
and
with
the
horrors
on
him
,
*NL*
and
Compeyson
's
wife
-LRB-
which
Compeyson
kicked
mostly
-RRB-
was
a
having
pity
*NL*
on
him
when
she
could
,
and
Compeyson
was
a
having
pity
on
nothing
and
*NL*
nobody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
a
took
warning
by
Arthur
,
but
I
did
n't
;
and
I
wo
n't

*NL*
was
partick
`

--
for
where
`
ud
be
the
good
on
it
,
dear
boy

comrade

*NL*
So
I
begun
wi
'
Compeyson
,
and
a
poor
tool
I
was
in
his
hands

Arthur
*NL*
lived
at
the
top
of
Compeyson
's
house
-LRB-
over
nigh
Brentford
it
was
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
Compeyson
kept
a
careful
account
agen
him
for
board
and
lodging
,
in
case
*NL*
he
should
ever
get
better
to
work
it
out
.
But
Arthur
soon
settled
the
*NL*
account
.
The
second
or
third
time
as
ever
I
see
him
,
he
come
a
tearing
*NL*
down
into
Compeyson
's
parlor
late
at
night
,
in
only
a
flannel
gown
,
with
*NL*
his
hair
all
in
a
sweat
,
and
he
says
to
Compeyson
's
wife
,
`
Sally
,
she
*NL*
really
is
upstairs
alonger
me
,
now
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
rid

her

She
's
*NL*
all
in
white

'
he
says
,
`
wi
'
white
flowers
in
her
hair
,
and
she
's
awful
*NL*
mad
,
and
she
's
got
a
shroud
hanging
over
her
arm

and
she
says
she
'll
*NL*
put
it
on
me
at
five
in
the
morning

*NL*
*NL*
``
Says
Compeyson
:

And
how

up

'
I
do

Arthur

shivering
dreadful
with

the
horrors

she
's
standing
in
the
corner
at
the
foot
of
the
bed

*NL*
awful
mad

And
over
where
her

's
broke

you

there
's
*NL*
drops
of
blood

*NL*
*NL*
``
Compeyson
spoke
hardy

he
was
always
a

Go
up

drivelling

says

lost

turned

off

once

all
's
said

Did
I
tell
you
as
I
was
tried
,
alone
,
for
misdemeanor
,
*NL*
while
with
Compeyson
?

*NL*
*NL*
I
answered
,
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
he
said
,
``
I
was
,
and
got
convicted

As
to
took
up
on
suspicion
,
*NL*
that
was
twice
or
three
times
in
the
four
or
five
year
that
it
lasted
;
*NL*
but
evidence
was
wanting
.
At
last
,
me
and
Compeyson
was
both
committed
*NL*
for
felony
,
--
on
a
charge
of
putting
stolen
notes
in
circulation
,
--
and
*NL*
there
was
other
charges
behind
.
Compeyson
says
to
me
,
`
Separate
*NL*
defences
,
no
communication
,
'
and
that
was
all
.
And
I
was
so
miserable
*NL*
poor
,
that
I
sold
all
the
clothes
I
had
,
except
what
hung
on
my
back
,
*NL*
afore
I
could
get
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
was
put
in
the
dock
,
I
noticed
first
of
all
what
a
gentleman
*NL*
Compeyson
looked
,
wi
'
his
curly
hair
and
his
black
clothes
and
his
white
*NL*
pocket-handkercher
,
and
what
a
common
sort
of
a
wretch
I
looked
.
When
*NL*
the
prosecution
opened
and
the
evidence
was
put
short
,
aforehand
,
I
*NL*
noticed
how
heavy
it
all
bore
on
me
,
and
how
light
on
him
.
When
the
*NL*
evidence
was
giv
in
the
box
,
I
noticed
how
it
was
always
me
that
had
*NL*
come
for
`
ard
,
and
could
be
swore
to
,
how
it
was
always
me
that
the
money
*NL*
had
been
paid
to
,
how
it
was
always
me
that
had
seemed
to
work
the
thing
*NL*
and
get
the
profit
.
But
when
the
defence
come
on
,
then
I
see
the
plan
*NL*
plainer
;
for
,
says
the
counsellor
for
Compeyson
,
`
My
lord
and
gentlemen
,
*NL*
here
you
has
afore
you
,
side
by
side
,
two
persons
as
your
eyes
can
*NL*
separate
wide
;
one
,
the
younger
,
well
brought
up
,
who
will
be
spoke
to
*NL*
as
such
;
one
,
the
elder
,
ill
brought
up
,
who
will
be
spoke
to
as
such
;
*NL*
one
,
the
younger
,
seldom
if
ever
seen
in
these
here
transactions
,
and
*NL*
only
suspected
;
t
`
other
,
the
elder
,
always
seen
in
'em
and
always
wi
'
his
*NL*
guilt
brought
home
.
Can
you
doubt
,
if
there
is
but
one
in
it
,
which
is
*NL*
the
one
,
and
,
if
there
is
two
in
it
,
which
is
much
the
worst
one
?
'
And
*NL*
such-like
.
And
when
it
come
to
character
,
war
n't
it
Compeyson
as
had
*NL*
been
to
the
school
,
and
war
n't
it
his
schoolfellows
as
was
in
this
*NL*
position
and
in
that
,
and
war
n't
it
him
as
had
been
know
'd
by
witnesses
*NL*
in
such
clubs
and
societies
,
and
nowt
to
his
disadvantage
?
And
war
n't
it
*NL*
me
as
had
been
tried
afore
,
and
as
had
been
know
'd
up
hill
and
down
dale
*NL*
in
Bridewells
and
Lock-Ups
!
And
when
it
come
to
speech-making
,
war
n't
it
*NL*
Compeyson
as
could
speak
to
'em
wi
'
his
face
dropping
every
now
and
then
*NL*
into
his
white
pocket-handkercher
,
--
ah
!
and
wi
'
verses
in
his
speech
,
*NL*
too
,
--
and
war
n't
it
me
as
could
only
say
,
`
Gentlemen
,
this
man
at
my
*NL*
side
is
a
most
precious
rascal

?
And
when
the
verdict
come
,
war
n't
it
*NL*
Compeyson
as
was
recommended
to
mercy
on
account
of
good
character

bad
company

giving
up
all
the
information
he
could
agen
me

*NL*

war
n't
it
me
as
got
never
a

And
when
I
says
to

Compeyson
,
`
Once
out

'll
smash

He
had
worked
himself
into

checked

out
his
hand
towards
me
said
,
in
a
reassuring
manner
,
``
I
ai
n't
a
going
*NL*
to
be
low
,
dear
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
so
heated
himself
that
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
*NL*
face
and
head
and
neck
and
hands
,
before
he
could
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
said
to
Compeyson
that
I
'd
smash
that
face
of
his
,
and
I
swore
*NL*
Lord
smash
mine
!
to
do
it
.
We
was
in
the
same
prison-ship
,
but
I
*NL*
could
n't
get
at
him
for
long
,
though
I
tried
.
At
last
I
come
behind
him
*NL*
and
hit
him
on
the
cheek
to
turn
him
round
and
get
a
smashing
one
at
*NL*
him
,
when
I
was
seen
and
seized
.
The
black-hole
of
that
ship
war
n't
*NL*
a
strong
one
,
to
a
judge
of
black-holes
that
could
swim
and
dive
.
I
*NL*
escaped
to
the
shore
,
and
I
was
a
hiding
among
the
graves
there
,
envying
*NL*
them
as
was
in
'em
and
all
over
,
when
I
first
see
my
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
regarded
me
with
a
look
of
affection
that
made
him
almost
abhorrent
*NL*
to
me
again
,
though
I
had
felt
great
pity
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
boy
,
I
was
giv
to
understand
as
Compeyson
was
out
on
them
marshes
*NL*
too
.
Upon
my
soul
,
I
half
believe
he
escaped
in
his
terror
,
to
get
quit
*NL*
of
me
,
not
knowing
it
was
me
as
had
got
ashore
.
I
hunted
him
down
.
I
*NL*
smashed
his
face
.
`
And
now
,
'
says
I
`
as
the
worst
thing
I
can
do
,
caring
*NL*
nothing
for
myself
,
I
'll
drag
you
back
.
'
And
I
'd
have
swum
off
,
towing
*NL*
him
by
the
hair
,
if
it
had
come
to
that
,
and
I
'd
a
got
him
aboard
*NL*
without
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
'd
much
the
best
of
it
to
the
last
,
--
his
character
was
so
*NL*
good
.
He
had
escaped
when
he
was
made
half
wild
by
me
and
my
murderous
*NL*
intentions
;
and
his
punishment
was
light
.
I
was
put
in
irons
,
brought
*NL*
to
trial
again
,
and
sent
for
life
.
I
did
n't
stop
for
life
,
dear
boy
and
*NL*
Pip
's
comrade
,
being
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wiped
himself
again
,
as
he
had
done
before
,
and
then
slowly
took
*NL*
his
tangle
of
tobacco
from
his
pocket
,
and
plucked
his
pipe
from
his
*NL*
button-hole
,
and
slowly
filled
it
,
and
began
to
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
dead
?
''
I
asked
,
after
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
who
dead

dear
boy

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

with

fierce
look

``

never

*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
had
been
writing
with
his
pencil
in
the
cover
of
a
book
.
He
*NL*
softly
pushed
the
book
over
to
me
,
as
Provis
stood
smoking
with
his
eyes
*NL*
on
the
fire
,
and
I
read
in
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
Havisham
's
name
was
Arthur
.
Compeyson
is
the
man
who
professed
to

be
Miss

's
lover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shut
the
book
and
nodded
slightly
to
Herbert
,
and
put
the
book
by
;
but
*NL*
we
neither
of
us
said
anything
,
and
both
looked
at
Provis
as
he
stood

smoking
by

Chapter
XLIII
*NL*
*NL*
Why
should
I
pause
to
ask
how
much
of
my
shrinking
from
Provis
might
be
*NL*
traced
to
Estella
?
Why
should
I
loiter
on
my
road
,
to
compare
the
state
*NL*
of
mind
in
which
I
had
tried
to
rid
myself
of
the
stain
of
the
prison
*NL*
before
meeting
her
at
the
coach-office
,
with
the
state
of
mind
in
which
*NL*
I
now
reflected
on
the
abyss
between
Estella
in
her
pride
and
beauty
,
*NL*
and
the
returned
transport
whom
I
harbored
?
The
road
would
be
none
the
*NL*
smoother
for
it
,
the
end
would
be
none
the
better
for
it
,
he
would
not
*NL*
be
helped
,
nor
I
extenuated
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
fear
had
been
engendered
in
my
mind
by
his
narrative
;
or
rather
,
*NL*
his
narrative
had
given
form
and
purpose
to
the
fear
that
was
already
*NL*
there
.
If
Compeyson
were
alive
and
should
discover
his
return
,
I
could
*NL*
hardly
doubt
the
consequence
.
That
Compeyson
stood
in
mortal
fear
of
*NL*
him
,
neither
of
the
two
could
know
much
better
than
I
;
and
that
any
*NL*
such
man
as
that
man
had
been
described
to
be
would
hesitate
to
release
*NL*
himself
for
good
from
a
dreaded
enemy
by
the
safe
means
of
becoming
an
*NL*
informer
was
scarcely
to
be
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
I
breathed
,
and
never
would
I
breathe
--
or
so
I
resolved
--
a
*NL*
word
of
Estella
to
Provis
.
But
,
I
said
to
Herbert
that
,
before
I
could
*NL*
go
abroad
,
I
must
see
both
Estella
and
Miss
Havisham
.
This
was
when
we
*NL*
were
left
alone
on
the
night
of
the
day
when
Provis
told
us
his
story
.
I
*NL*
resolved
to
go
out
to
Richmond
next
day
,
and
I
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
my
presenting
myself
at
Mrs.
Brandley
's
,
Estella
's
maid
was
called
to
*NL*
tell
that
Estella
had
gone
into
the
country
.
Where
?
To
Satis
House
,
as
*NL*
usual
.
Not
as
usual
,
I
said
,
for
she
had
never
yet
gone
there
without
*NL*
me
;
when
was
she
coming
back
?
There
was
an
air
of
reservation
in
the
*NL*
answer
which
increased
my
perplexity
,
and
the
answer
was
,
that
her
maid
*NL*
believed
she
was
only
coming
back
at
all
for
a
little
while
.
I
could
*NL*
make
nothing
of
this
,
except
that
it
was
meant
that
I
should
make
*NL*
nothing
of
it
,
and
I
went
home
again
in
complete
discomfiture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
night
consultation
with
Herbert
after
Provis
was
gone
home
-LRB-
I
*NL*
always
took
him
home
,
and
always
looked
well
about
me
-RRB-
,
led
us
to
the
*NL*
conclusion
that
nothing
should
be
said
about
going
abroad
until
I
came
*NL*
back
from
Miss
Havisham
's
.
In
the
mean
time
,
Herbert
and
I
were
to
*NL*
consider
separately
what
it
would
be
best
to
say
;
whether
we
should
*NL*
devise
any
pretence
of
being
afraid
that
he
was
under
suspicious
*NL*
observation
;
or
whether
I
,
who
had
never
yet
been
abroad
,
should
propose
*NL*
an
expedition
.
We
both
knew
that
I
had
but
to
propose
anything
,
and
he
*NL*
would
consent
.
We
agreed
that
his
remaining
many
days
in
his
present
*NL*
hazard
was
not
to
be
thought
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
I
had
the
meanness
to
feign
that
I
was
under
a
binding
promise
*NL*
to
go
down
to
Joe
;
but
I
was
capable
of
almost
any
meanness
towards
Joe
*NL*
or
his
name
.
Provis
was
to
be
strictly
careful
while
I
was
gone
,
and
*NL*
Herbert
was
to
take
the
charge
of
him
that
I
had
taken
.
I
was
to
be
*NL*
absent
only
one
night
,
and
,
on
my
return
,
the
gratification
of
his
*NL*
impatience
for
my
starting
as
a
gentleman
on
a
greater
scale
was
to
*NL*
be
begun
.
It
occurred
to
me
then
,
and
as
I
afterwards
found
to
*NL*
Herbert
also
,
that
he
might
be
best
got
away
across
the
water
,
on
that
*NL*
pretence
,
--
as
,
to
make
purchases
,
or
the
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
cleared
the
way
for
my
expedition
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
I
set
*NL*
off
by
the
early
morning
coach
before
it
was
yet
light
,
and
was
out
*NL*
on
the
open
country
road
when
the
day
came
creeping
on
,
halting
and
*NL*
whimpering
and
shivering
,
and
wrapped
in
patches
of
cloud
and
rags
of
*NL*
mist
,
like
a
beggar
.
When
we
drove
up
to
the
Blue
Boar
after
a
drizzly
*NL*
ride
,
whom
should
I
see
come
out
under
the
gateway
,
toothpick
in
hand
,
*NL*
to
look
at
the
coach
,
but
Bentley
Drummle
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
pretended
not
to
see
me
,
I
pretended
not
to
see
him
.
It
was
a
very
*NL*
lame
pretence
on
both
sides
;
the
lamer
,
because
we
both
went
into
the
*NL*
coffee-room
,
where
he
had
just
finished
his
breakfast
,
and
where
I
*NL*
ordered
mine
.
It
was
poisonous
to
me
to
see
him
in
the
town
,
for
I
very
*NL*
well
knew
why
he
had
come
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pretending
to
read
a
smeary
newspaper
long
out
of
date
,
which
had
*NL*
nothing
half
so
legible
in
its
local
news
,
as
the
foreign
matter
of
*NL*
coffee
,
pickles
,
fish
sauces
,
gravy
,
melted
butter
,
and
wine
with
which
*NL*
it
was
sprinkled
all
over
,
as
if
it
had
taken
the
measles
in
a
highly
*NL*
irregular
form
,
I
sat
at
my
table
while
he
stood
before
the
fire
.
By
*NL*
degrees
it
became
an
enormous
injury
to
me
that
he
stood
before
the
*NL*
fire
.
And
I
got
up
,
determined
to
have
my
share
of
it
.
I
had
to
put
my
*NL*
hand
behind
his
legs
for
the
poker
when
I
went
up
to
the
fireplace
to
*NL*
stir
the
fire
,
but
still
pretended
not
to
know
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
a
cut
?
''
said
Mr.
Drummle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
I
,
poker
in
hand
;
``
it
's
you
,
is
it
?
How
do
you
do
?
I
was
*NL*
wondering
who
it
was
,
who
kept
the
fire
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
I
poked
tremendously
,
and
having
done
so
,
planted
myself
side
*NL*
by
side
with
Mr.
Drummle
,
my
shoulders
squared
and
my
back
to
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
just
come
down
?
''
said
Mr.
Drummle
,
edging
me
a
little
away
*NL*
with
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I
,
edging
him
a
little
away
with
my
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beastly
place
,
''
said
Drummle
.
``
Your
part
of
the
country
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
assented
.
``
I
am
told
it
's
very
like
your
Shropshire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least
like
it
,
''
said
Drummle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr.
Drummle
looked
at
his
boots
and
I
looked
at
mine
,
and
then
Mr.
*NL*
Drummle
looked
at
my
boots
,
and
I
looked
at
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
here
long
?
''
I
asked
,
determined
not
to
yield
an
inch
of
*NL*
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
enough
to
be
tired
of
it
,
''
returned
Drummle
,
pretending
to
yawn
,
*NL*
but
equally
determined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
stay
here
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
say
,
''
answered
Mr.
Drummle
.
``
Do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
say
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
here
,
through
a
tingling
in
my
blood
,
that
if
Mr.
Drummle
's
*NL*
shoulder
had
claimed
another
hair
's
breadth
of
room
,
I
should
have
*NL*
jerked
him
into
the
window
;
equally
,
that
if
my
own
shoulder
had
urged
a
*NL*
similar
claim
,
Mr.
Drummle
would
have
jerked
me
into
the
nearest
box
.
He
*NL*
whistled
a
little
.
So
did
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Large
tract
of
marshes
about
here
,
I
believe
?
''
said
Drummle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
What
of
that
?
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Drummle
looked
at
me
,
and
then
at
my
boots
,
and
then
said
,
``
Oh
!
''
and
*NL*
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
amused
,
Mr.
Drummle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
``
not
particularly
.
I
am
going
out
for
a
ride
in
the
*NL*
saddle
.
I
mean
to
explore
those
marshes
for
amusement
.
Out-of-the-way
*NL*
villages
there
,
they
tell
me
.
Curious
little
public-houses
--
and
*NL*
smithies
--
and
that

Waiter

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
horse
of
mine
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brought
round
to
the
door
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
.
Look
here

you
sir

The
lady
wo
n't

wo

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
Drummle
glanced
at
me
,
with
an
insolent
triumph
on
his
*NL*
great-jowled
face
that
cut
me
to
the
heart
,
dull
as
he
was
,
and
so
*NL*
exasperated
me
,
that
I
felt
inclined
to
take
him
in
my
arms
-LRB-
as
the
*NL*
robber
in
the
story-book
is
said
to
have
taken
the
old
lady
-RRB-
and
seat
*NL*
him
on
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
was
manifest
to
both
of
us
,
and
that
was
,
that
until
relief
*NL*
came
,
neither
of
us
could
relinquish
the
fire
.
There
we
stood
,
well
*NL*
squared
up
before
it
,
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
foot
to
foot
,
with
our
*NL*
hands
behind
us
,
not
budging
an
inch
.
The
horse
was
visible
outside
in
*NL*
the
drizzle
at
the
door
,
my
breakfast
was
put
on
the
table
,
Drummle
's
*NL*
was
cleared
away
,
the
waiter
invited
me
to
begin
,
I
nodded
,
we
both
*NL*
stood
our
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
to
the
Grove
since
?
''
said
Drummle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
had
quite
enough
of
the
Finches
the
last
time
I
was
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
when
we
had
a
difference
of
opinion

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
I
replied
,
very
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
!
They
let
you
off
easily
enough

sneered
Drummle
.
``
You

should
n't
have
lost
your
temper

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Drummle

said
I
,
``
you
are
not
competent
to
give
advice
on
that

subject

When
I
lose
my
temper
-LRB-
not
that
I
admit
having
done
so
on
that

occasion

,
I
do
n't
throw
glasses

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
said
Drummle
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
glancing
at
him
once
or
twice
,
in
an
increased
state
of
*NL*
smouldering
ferocity
,
I
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Drummle
,
I
did
not
seek
this
conversation
,
and
I
do
n't
think
it
an
*NL*
agreeable
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
it
's
not
,
''
said
he
,
superciliously
over
his
shoulder
;
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
anything
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
therefore
,
''
I
went
on
,
``
with
your
leave
,
I
will
suggest
that
we
*NL*
hold
no
kind
of
communication
in
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
my
opinion
,
''
said
Drummle
,
``
and
what
I
should
have
suggested
*NL*
myself
,
or
done
--
more
likely
--
without
suggesting
.
But
do
n't
lose
your
*NL*
temper
.
Have
n't
you
lost
enough
without
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waiter
!
''
said
Drummle
,
by
way
of
answering
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
you
sir
.
You
quite
understand
that
the
young
lady
do
n't
ride
*NL*
to-day
,
and
that
I
dine
at
the
young
lady
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
waiter
had
felt
my
fast-cooling
teapot
with
the
palm
of
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
had
looked
imploringly
at
me
,
and
had
gone
out
,
Drummle
,
*NL*
careful
not
to
move
the
shoulder
next
me
,
took
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
*NL*
and
bit
the
end
off
,
but
showed
no
sign
of
stirring
.
Choking
and
*NL*
boiling
as
I
was
,
I
felt
that
we
could
not
go
a
word
further
,
without
*NL*
introducing
Estella
's
name
,
which
I
could
not
endure
to
hear
him
utter
;
*NL*
and
therefore
I
looked
stonily
at
the
opposite
wall
,
as
if
there
were
*NL*
no
one
present
,
and
forced
myself
to
silence
.
How
long
we
might
have
*NL*
remained
in
this
ridiculous
position
it
is
impossible
to
say
,
but
*NL*
for
the
incursion
of
three
thriving
farmers
--
laid
on
by
the
waiter
,
I
*NL*
think
--
who
came
into
the
coffee-room
unbuttoning
their
great-coats
and
*NL*
rubbing
their
hands
,
and
before
whom
,
as
they
charged
at
the
fire
,
we
*NL*
were
obliged
to
give
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
him
through
the
window
,
seizing
his
horse
's
mane
,
and
mounting
in
*NL*
his
blundering
brutal
manner
,
and
sidling
and
backing
away
.
I
thought
*NL*
he
was
gone
,
when
he
came
back
,
calling
for
a
light
for
the
cigar
in
his
*NL*
mouth
,
which
he
had
forgotten
.
A
man
in
a
dust-colored
dress
appeared
*NL*
with
what
was
wanted
,
--
I
could
not
have
said
from
where
:
whether
from
*NL*
the
inn
yard
,
or
the
street
,
or
where
not
,
--
and
as
Drummle
leaned
down
*NL*
from
the
saddle
and
lighted
his
cigar
and
laughed
,
with
a
jerk
of
his
*NL*
head
towards
the
coffee-room
windows
,
the
slouching
shoulders
and
ragged
*NL*
hair
of
this
man
whose
back
was
towards
me
reminded
me
of
Orlick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Too
heavily
out
of
sorts
to
care
much
at
the
time
whether
it
were
he
or
*NL*
no
,
or
after
all
to
touch
the
breakfast
,
I
washed
the
weather
and
the
*NL*
journey
from
my
face
and
hands
,
and
went
out
to
the
memorable
old
house
*NL*
that
it
would
have
been
so
much
the
better
for
me
never
to
have
entered
,
*NL*
never
to
have
seen
.

Chapter
XLIV
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
room
where
the
dressing-table
stood
,
and
where
the
wax-candles
*NL*
burnt
on
the
wall
,
I
found
Miss
Havisham
and
Estella
;
Miss
Havisham
*NL*
seated
on
a
settee
near
the
fire
,
and
Estella
on
a
cushion
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
Estella
was
knitting
,
and
Miss
Havisham
was
looking
on
.
They
both
raised
*NL*
their
eyes
as
I
went
in
,
and
both
saw
an
alteration
in
me
.
I
derived
*NL*
that
,
from
the
look
they
interchanged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
wind
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
``
blows
you
here
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
looked
steadily
at
me
,
I
saw
that
she
was
rather
confused
.
*NL*
Estella
,
pausing
a
moment
in
her
knitting
with
her
eyes
upon
me
,
and
*NL*
then
going
on
,
I
fancied
that
I
read
in
the
action
of
her
fingers
,
as
*NL*
plainly
as
if
she
had
told
me
in
the
dumb
alphabet
,
that
she
perceived
I
*NL*
had
discovered
my
real
benefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Havisham
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
went
to
Richmond
yesterday
,
to
speak
to
*NL*
Estella
;
and
finding
that
some
wind
had
blown
her
here
,
I
followed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
motioning
to
me
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
to
sit
down
,
*NL*
I
took
the
chair
by
the
dressing-table
,
which
I
had
often
seen
her
*NL*
occupy
.
With
all
that
ruin
at
my
feet
and
about
me
,
it
seemed
a
natural
*NL*
place
for
me
,
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
had
to
say
to
Estella
,
Miss
Havisham
,
I
will
say
before
you
,
*NL*
presently
--
in
a
few
moments
.
It
will
not
surprise
you
,
it
will
not
*NL*
displease
you
.
I
am
as
unhappy
as
you
can
ever
have
meant
me
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
continued
to
look
steadily
at
me
.
I
could
see
in
the
*NL*
action
of
Estella
's
fingers
as
they
worked
that
she
attended
to
what
I
*NL*
said
;
but
she
did
not
look
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
found
out
who
my
patron
is
.
It
is
not
a
fortunate
discovery
,
*NL*
and
is
not
likely
ever
to
enrich
me
in
reputation
,
station
,
fortune
,
*NL*
anything
.
There
are
reasons
why
I
must
say
no
more
of
that
.
It
is
not
my
*NL*
secret
,
but
another
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
silent
for
a
while
,
looking
at
Estella
and
considering
how
to
*NL*
go
on
,
Miss
Havisham
repeated
,
``
It
is
not
your
secret
,
but
another
's
.
*NL*
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
first
caused
me
to
be
brought
here
,
Miss
Havisham
,
when
I
*NL*
belonged
to
the
village
over
yonder
,
that
I
wish
I
had
never
left
,
*NL*
I
suppose
I
did
really
come
here
,
as
any
other
chance
boy
might
have
*NL*
come
,
--
as
a
kind
of
servant
,
to
gratify
a
want
or
a
whim
,
and
to
be
paid
*NL*
for
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
Pip
,
''
replied
Miss
Havisham
,
steadily
nodding
her
head
;
``
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
Mr.
Jaggers
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jaggers
,
''
said
Miss
Havisham
,
taking
me
up
in
a
firm
tone
,
``
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
and
knew
nothing
of
it
.
His
being
my
lawyer
,
and
*NL*
his
being
the
lawyer
of
your
patron
is
a
coincidence
.
He
holds
the
same
*NL*
relation
towards
numbers
of
people
,
and
it
might
easily
arise
.
Be
that
*NL*
as
it
may
,
it
did
arise
,
and
was
not
brought
about
by
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
might
have
seen
in
her
haggard
face
that
there
was
no
*NL*
suppression
or
evasion
so
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
I
fell
into
the
mistake
I
have
so
long
remained
in
,
at
least
*NL*
you
led
me
on
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
returned
,
again
nodding
steadily
,
``
I
let
you
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
kind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
am
I
,
''
cried
Miss
Havisham
,
striking
her
stick
upon
the
floor
*NL*
and
flashing
into
wrath
so
suddenly
that
Estella
glanced
up
at
her
in
*NL*
surprise
,
--
``
who
am
I
,
for
God
's
sake
,
that
I
should
be
kind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
weak
complaint
to
have
made
,
and
I
had
not
meant
to
make
it
.
I
*NL*
told
her
so
,
as
she
sat
brooding
after
this
outburst
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
well
!
''
she
said
.
``
What
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
liberally
paid
for
my
old
attendance
here
,
''
I
said
,
to
soothe
*NL*
her
,
``
in
being
apprenticed
,
and
I
have
asked
these
questions
only
for
*NL*
my
own
information

What
follows
has
another
-LRB-
and
I
hope
more
*NL*
disinterested
-RRB-
purpose
.
In
humoring
my
mistake
,
Miss
Havisham
,
you
*NL*
punished
--
practised
on
--
perhaps
you
will
supply
whatever
term
expresses
*NL*
your
intention
,
without
offence
--
your
self-seeking
relations
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
.
Why

they
would
have
it
so
!
So
would
you

What
has
been
my
*NL*
history
,
that
I
should
be
at
the
pains
of
entreating
either
them
or
you
*NL*
not
to
have
it
so
!
You
made
your
own
snares

I
never
made

*NL*
*NL*
Waiting
until
she
was
quiet
again
,
--
for
this
,
too
,
flashed
out
of
her
in
*NL*
a
wild
and
sudden
way
,
--
I
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thrown
among

family
of
your
relations

been
constantly
among
them
since
I
went
to
London

I
know
them
*NL*
to
have
been
as
honestly
under
my
delusion
as
I
myself
.
And
I
should
be
*NL*
false
and
base
if
I
did
not
tell
you
,
whether
it
is
acceptable
to
you
or
*NL*
no
,
and
whether
you
are
inclined
to
give
credence
to
it
or
no
,
that
you
*NL*
deeply
wrong
both
Mr.
Matthew
Pocket
and
his
son
Herbert
,
if
you
suppose
*NL*
them
to
be
otherwise
than
generous
,
upright
,
open
,
and
incapable
of
*NL*
anything
designing
or
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
your
friends

said
Miss
Havisham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
made
themselves
my
friends

said
I
,
``
when
they
supposed
me
*NL*

have
superseded
them

and
when
Sarah
Pocket

Georgiana

Mistress
Camilla
were
not
my
friends

I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
contrasting
of
them
with
the
rest
seemed
,
I
was
glad
to
see
,
to
do
*NL*
them
good
with
her
.
She
looked
at
me
keenly
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
*NL*
said
quietly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Only

said
I
,
``

not
confound

may
be
of

believe
me

they
are
not

*NL*
*NL*
Still
looking
at
me
keenly
,
Miss
Havisham
repeated
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not

cunning

you
see

I
said
,
in
answer
,
conscious
that
I
*NL*
reddened
a
little
,
``
as
that
I
could
hide
from
you

desired

Havisham
,
if
you
would
spare
the
money
*NL*
to
do
my
friend
Herbert
a
lasting
service
in
life
,
but
which
from
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
case
must
be
done
without
his
knowledge

I
could
show
you
*NL*
how

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
must
it
be
done
without
his
knowledge

''
she
asked
,
settling
her
*NL*
hands
upon
her
stick
,
that
she
might
regard
me
the
more
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

said
I
,
``
I
began
the
service
myself

more
than
two
years

*NL*
without

I
do
n't
want
to
be
betrayed
.
Why
I
fail
in
my
*NL*
ability
to
finish
it
,
I
can
not
explain
.
It
is
a
part
of
the
secret
which
*NL*
is
another

not
mine

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gradually
withdrew
her
eyes
from
me
,
and
turned
them
on
the
fire
.
*NL*
After
watching
it
for
what
appeared
in
the
silence
and
by
the
light
*NL*
of
the
slowly
wasting
candles
to
be
a
long
time
,
she
was
roused
by
*NL*
the
collapse
of
some
of
the
red
coals
,
and
looked
towards
me
again
--
at
*NL*
first
,
vacantly
--
then
,
with
a
gradually
concentrating
attention
.
All
*NL*
this
time
Estella
knitted
on
.
When
Miss
Havisham
had
fixed
her
*NL*
attention
on
me
,
she
said
,
speaking
as
if
there
had
been
no
lapse
in
our
*NL*
dialogue
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Estella
,
''
said
I
,
turning
to
her
now
,
and
trying
to
command
my
*NL*
trembling
voice
,
``
you
know
I
love
you
.
You
know
that
I
have
loved
you
*NL*
long
and
dearly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
eyes
to
my
face
,
on
being
thus
addressed
,
and
her
fingers
*NL*
plied
their
work
,
and
she
looked
at
me
with
an
unmoved
countenance
.
I
*NL*
saw
that
Miss
Havisham
glanced
from
me
to
her
,
and
from
her
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
said
this
sooner
,
but
for
my
long
mistake
.
It
induced
me
*NL*
to
hope
that
Miss
Havisham
meant
us
for
one
another
.
While
I
thought
you
*NL*
could
not
help
yourself
,
as
it
were
,
I
refrained
from
saying
it
.
But
I
*NL*
must
say
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Preserving
her
unmoved
countenance
,
and
with
her
fingers
still
going
,
*NL*
Estella
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
said
I
,
in
answer
to
that
action
,
--
``
I
know
.
I
have
no
hope
*NL*
that
I
shall
ever
call
you
mine
,
Estella
.
I
am
ignorant
what
may
become
*NL*
of
me
very
soon
,
how
poor
I
may
be
,
or
where
I
may
go
.
Still
,
I
love
*NL*
you
.
I
have
loved
you
ever
since
I
first
saw
you
in
this
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
at
me
perfectly
unmoved
and
with
her
fingers
busy
,
she
shook
her
*NL*
head
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
been
cruel
in
Miss
Havisham
,
horribly
cruel
,
to
practise
*NL*
on
the
susceptibility
of
a
poor
boy
,
and
to
torture
me
through
all
these
*NL*
years
with
a
vain
hope
and
an
idle
pursuit
,
if
she
had
reflected
on
the
*NL*
gravity
of
what
she
did
.
But
I
think
she
did
not
.
I
think
that
,
in
the
*NL*
endurance
of
her
own
trial
,
she
forgot
mine
,
Estella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
Miss
Havisham
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
and
hold
it
there
,
as
she
*NL*
sat
looking
by
turns
at
Estella
and
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
,
''
said
Estella
,
very
calmly
,
``
that
there
are
sentiments
,
*NL*
fancies
,
--
I
do
n't
know
how
to
call
them
,
--
which
I
am
not
able
to
*NL*
comprehend
.
When
you
say
you
love
me
,
I
know
what
you
mean
,
as
a
form
*NL*
of
words
;
but
nothing
more
.
You
address
nothing
in
my
breast
,
you
touch
*NL*
nothing
there
.
I
do
n't
care
for
what
you
say
at
all
.
I
have
tried
to
*NL*
warn
you
of
this
;
now
,
have
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
in
a
miserable
manner
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
you
would
not
be
warned
,
for
you
thought
I
did
not
mean
it

*NL*
Now
,
did
you
not
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought

hoped
you
could
not

You
,
so
young

untried

and
*NL*
beautiful
,
Estella
!
Surely
it
is
not
in
Nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
in
my
nature
,
''
she
returned
.
And
then
she
added
,
with
a
stress
*NL*
upon
the
words
,
``
It
is
in
the
nature
formed
within
me
.
I
make
a
great
*NL*
difference
between
you
and
all
other
people
when
I
say
so
much
.
I
can
do
*NL*
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
not
true
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
Bentley
Drummle
is
in
town
here
,
and
*NL*
pursuing
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
true

''
she
replied
,
referring
to
him
with
the
indifference
*NL*
of
utter
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
encourage
him
,
and
ride
out
with
him
,
and
that
he
dines
with
*NL*
you
this
very
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
a
little
surprised
that
I
should
know
it
,
but
again
replied
,
*NL*
``
Quite
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
love
him
,
Estella
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fingers
stopped
for
the
first
time
,
as
she
retorted
rather
angrily
,
*NL*
``
What
have
I
told
you
?
Do
you
still
think
,
in
spite
of
it
,
that
I
do
not
*NL*
mean
what
I
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
never
marry
him
,
Estella
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
towards
Miss
Havisham
,
and
considered
for
a
moment
with
her
*NL*
work
in
her
hands
.
Then
she
said
,
``
Why
not
tell
you
the
truth
?
I
am
*NL*
going
to
be
married
to
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
dropped
my
face
into
my
hands
,
but
was
able
to
control
myself
better
*NL*
than
I
could
have
expected
,
considering
what
agony
it
gave
me
to
hear
*NL*
her
say
those
words
.
When
I
raised
my
face
again
,
there
was
such
a
*NL*
ghastly
look
upon
Miss
Havisham
's
,
that
it
impressed
me
,
even
in
my
*NL*
passionate
hurry
and
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Estella
,
dearest
Estella
,
do
not
let
Miss
Havisham
lead
you
into
this
*NL*
fatal
step
.
Put
me
aside
for
ever
,
--
you
have
done
so
,
I
well
know
,
--
but
*NL*
bestow
yourself
on
some
worthier
person
than
Drummle
.
Miss
Havisham
*NL*
gives
you
to
him
,
as
the
greatest
slight
and
injury
that
could
be
done
*NL*
to
the
many
far
better
men
who
admire
you
,
and
to
the
few
who
truly
*NL*
love
you
.
Among
those
few
there
may
be
one
who
loves
you
even
as
dearly
,
*NL*
though
he
has
not
loved
you
as
long
,
as
I.
Take
him
,
and
I
can
bear
it
*NL*
better
,
for
your
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
earnestness
awoke
a
wonder
in
her
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
have
*NL*
been
touched
with
compassion
,
if
she
could
have
rendered
me
at
all
*NL*
intelligible
to
her
own
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
,
''
she
said
again
,
in
a
gentler
voice
,
``
to
be
married
to
*NL*
him
.
The
preparations
for
my
marriage
are
making
,
and
I
shall
be
*NL*
married
soon
.
Why
do
you
injuriously
introduce
the
name
of
my
mother
by
*NL*
adoption
?
It
is
my
own
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
own
act
,
Estella
,
to
fling
yourself
away
upon
a
brute

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
whom
should
I
fling
myself
away
?
''
she
retorted
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
``
Should
I
fling
myself
away
upon
the
man
who
would
the
soonest
feel
-LRB-

*NL*
people
do

such
things
-RRB-
that
I
took
nothing

him
?
There
!
It
is
*NL*
done
.
I
shall
do
well
enough
,
and
so
will
my
husband
.
As
to
leading
*NL*
me
into
what
you
call
this
fatal
step
,
Miss
Havisham
would
have
had
me
*NL*
wait
,
and
not
marry
yet
;
but
I
am
tired
of
the
life
I
have
led
,
which
*NL*
has
very
few
charms
for
me
,
and
I
am
willing
enough
to
change
it

Say
no

more

We
shall
never
understand
each
other

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
mean
brute
,
such
a
stupid
brute

I
urged
,
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
my
being
a
blessing
to
him

said
Estella
;
``
I

*NL*
not

Come

Here
is
my

visionary

boy

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Estella

I
answered
,
as
my
bitter
tears
fell
fast
on
her
hand
,
do
*NL*
what
I
would
to
restrain
them
;
``
even
if
I
remained
in
England

could
*NL*
hold
my
head
up
with
the
rest

how

you
Drummle
's
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
''
she
returned
,
--
``
nonsense

This
will
pass
in
no
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
Estella
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
get
me
out
of
your
thoughts
in
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
my
thoughts
!
You
are
part
of
my
existence
,
part
of
myself
.
You
*NL*
have
been
in
every
line
I
have
ever
read
since
I
first
came
here
,
the
*NL*
rough
common
boy
whose
poor
heart
you
wounded
even
then
.
You
have
been
*NL*
in
every
prospect
I
have
ever
seen
since
,
--
on
the
river
,
on
the
sails
of
*NL*
the
ships
,
on
the
marshes
,
in
the
clouds
,
in
the
light
,
in
the
darkness
,
*NL*
in
the
wind
,
in
the
woods
,
in
the
sea
,
in
the
streets
.
You
have
been
*NL*
the
embodiment
of
every
graceful
fancy
that
my
mind
has
ever
become
*NL*
acquainted
with
.
The
stones
of
which
the
strongest
London
buildings
*NL*
are
made
are
not
more
real
,
or
more
impossible
to
be
displaced
by
your
*NL*
hands
,
than
your
presence
and
influence
have
been
to
me
,
there
and
*NL*
everywhere
,
and
will
be
.
Estella
,
to
the
last
hour
of
my
life
,
you
*NL*
can
not
choose
but
remain
part
of
my
character
,
part
of
the
little
good
*NL*
in
me
,
part
of
the
evil
.
But
,
in
this
separation
,
I
associate
you
only
*NL*
with
the
good
;
and
I
will
faithfully
hold
you
to
that
always
,
for
you
*NL*
must
have
done
me
far
more
good
than
harm
,
let
me
feel
now
what
sharp
*NL*
distress
I
may
.
O
God
bless
you
,
God
forgive
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
what
ecstasy
of
unhappiness
I
got
these
broken
words
out
of
myself
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
.
The
rhapsody
welled
up
within
me
,
like
blood
from
an
*NL*
inward
wound
,
and
gushed
out
.
I
held
her
hand
to
my
lips
some
lingering
*NL*
moments
,
and
so
I
left
her
.
But
ever
afterwards
,
I
remembered
,
--
and
soon
*NL*
afterwards
with
stronger
reason
,
--
that
while
Estella
looked
at
me
merely
*NL*
with
incredulous
wonder
,
the
spectral
figure
of
Miss
Havisham
,
her
hand
*NL*
still
covering
her
heart
,
seemed
all
resolved
into
a
ghastly
stare
of
*NL*
pity
and
remorse
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
done
,
all
gone
!
So
much
was
done
and
gone
,
that
when
I
went
out
at
*NL*
the
gate
,
the
light
of
the
day
seemed
of
a
darker
color
than
when
I
went
*NL*
in
.
For
a
while
,
I
hid
myself
among
some
lanes
and
by-paths
,
and
then
*NL*
struck
off
to
walk
all
the
way
to
London
.
For
,
I
had
by
that
time
come
*NL*
to
myself
so
far
as
to
consider
that
I
could
not
go
back
to
the
inn
and
*NL*
see
Drummle
there
;
that
I
could
not
bear
to
sit
upon
the
coach
and
*NL*
be
spoken
to
;
that
I
could
do
nothing
half
so
good
for
myself
as
tire
*NL*
myself
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
midnight
when
I
crossed
London
Bridge
.
Pursuing
the
narrow
*NL*
intricacies
of
the
streets
which
at
that
time
tended
westward
near
the
*NL*
Middlesex
shore
of
the
river
,
my
readiest
access
to
the
Temple
was
*NL*
close
by
the
river-side
,
through
Whitefriars
.
I
was
not
expected
till
*NL*
to-morrow
;
but
I
had
my
keys
,
and
,
if
Herbert
were
gone
to
bed
,
could
*NL*
get
to
bed
myself
without
disturbing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
seldom
happened
that
I
came
in
at
that
Whitefriars
gate
after
the
*NL*
Temple
was
closed
,
and
as
I
was
very
muddy
and
weary
,
I
did
not
take
it
*NL*
ill
that
the
night-porter
examined
me
with
much
attention
as
he
held
the
*NL*
gate
a
little
way
open
for
me
to
pass
in
.
To
help
his
memory
I
mentioned
*NL*
my
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
quite
sure
,
sir
,
but
I
thought
so
.
Here
's
a
note
,
sir
.
The
*NL*
messenger
that
brought
it
,
said
would
you
be
so
good
as
read
it
by
my
*NL*
lantern
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Much
surprised
by
the
request
,
I
took
the
note
.
It
was
directed
to
*NL*
Philip
Pip
,
Esquire
,
and
on
the
top
of
the
superscription
were
the
*NL*
words
,
``
PLEASE
READ
THIS
,
HERE
.
''
I
opened
it
,
the
watchman
holding
up
*NL*
his
light
,
and
read
inside
,
in
Wemmick
's
writing
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
DO
N'T
GO
HOME

Chapter
XLV
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
from
the
Temple
gate
as
soon
as
I
had
read
the
warning
,
I
made
*NL*
the
best
of
my
way
to
Fleet
Street
,
and
there
got
a
late
hackney
chariot
*NL*
and
drove
to
the
Hummums
in
Covent
Garden
.
In
those
times
a
bed
was
*NL*
always
to
be
got
there
at
any
hour
of
the
night
,
and
the
chamberlain
,
*NL*
letting
me
in
at
his
ready
wicket
,
lighted
the
candle
next
in
order
on
*NL*
his
shelf
,
and
showed
me
straight
into
the
bedroom
next
in
order
on
his
*NL*
list
.
It
was
a
sort
of
vault
on
the
ground
floor
at
the
back
,
with
a
*NL*
despotic
monster
of
a
four-post
bedstead
in
it
,
straddling
over
the
*NL*
whole
place
,
putting
one
of
his
arbitrary
legs
into
the
fireplace
*NL*
and
another
into
the
doorway
,
and
squeezing
the
wretched
little
*NL*
washing-stand
in
quite
a
Divinely
Righteous
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
had
asked
for
a
night-light
,
the
chamberlain
had
brought
me
in
,
*NL*
before
he
left
me
,
the
good
old
constitutional
rushlight
of
those
*NL*
virtuous
days
--
an
object
like
the
ghost
of
a
walking-cane
,
which
*NL*
instantly
broke
its
back
if
it
were
touched
,
which
nothing
could
ever
be
*NL*
lighted
at
,
and
which
was
placed
in
solitary
confinement
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
a
high
tin
tower
,
perforated
with
round
holes
that
made
a
staringly
*NL*
wide-awake
pattern
on
the
walls
.
When
I
had
got
into
bed
,
and
lay
there
*NL*
footsore
,
weary
,
and
wretched
,
I
found
that
I
could
no
more
close
my
own
*NL*
eyes
than
I
could
close
the
eyes
of
this
foolish
Argus
.
And
thus
,
in
the
*NL*
gloom
and
death
of
the
night
,
we
stared
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
doleful
night
!
How
anxious
,
how
dismal
,
how
long
!
There
was
an
*NL*
inhospitable
smell
in
the
room
,
of
cold
soot
and
hot
dust
;
and
,
as
I
*NL*
looked
up
into
the
corners
of
the
tester
over
my
head
,
I
thought
what
*NL*
a
number
of
blue-bottle
flies
from
the
butchers
'
,
and
earwigs
from
the
*NL*
market
,
and
grubs
from
the
country
,
must
be
holding
on
up
there
,
lying
*NL*
by
for
next
summer
.
This
led
me
to
speculate
whether
any
of
them
ever
*NL*
tumbled
down
,
and
then
I
fancied
that
I
felt
light
falls
on
my
face
,
--
a
*NL*
disagreeable
turn
of
thought
,
suggesting
other
and
more
objectionable
*NL*
approaches
up
my
back
.
When
I
had
lain
awake
a
little
while
,
those
*NL*
extraordinary
voices
with
which
silence
teems
began
to
make
themselves
*NL*
audible
.
The
closet
whispered
,
the
fireplace
sighed
,
the
little
*NL*
washing-stand
ticked
,
and
one
guitar-string
played
occasionally
in
the
*NL*
chest
of
drawers
.
At
about
the
same
time
,
the
eyes
on
the
wall
acquired
*NL*
a
new
expression
,
and
in
every
one
of
those
staring
rounds
I
saw
*NL*
written
,
DO
N'T
GO
HOME
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
night-fancies
and
night-noises
crowded
on
me
,
they
never
warded
*NL*
off
this
DO
N'T
GO
HOME
.
It
plaited
itself
into
whatever
I
thought
of
,
*NL*
as
a
bodily
pain
would
have
done
.
Not
long
before
,
I
had
read
in
the
*NL*
newspapers
,
how
a
gentleman
unknown
had
come
to
the
Hummums
in
the
*NL*
night
,
and
had
gone
to
bed
,
and
had
destroyed
himself
,
and
had
been
*NL*
found
in
the
morning
weltering
in
blood
.
It
came
into
my
head
that
he
*NL*
must
have
occupied
this
very
vault
of
mine
,
and
I
got
out
of
bed
to
*NL*
assure
myself
that
there
were
no
red
marks
about
;
then
opened
the
door
*NL*
to
look
out
into
the
passages
,
and
cheer
myself
with
the
companionship
*NL*
of
a
distant
light
,
near
which
I
knew
the
chamberlain
to
be
dozing
.
But
*NL*
all
this
time
,
why
I
was
not
to
go
home
,
and
what
had
happened
at
home
,
*NL*
and
when
I
should
go
home
,
and
whether
Provis
was
safe
at
home
,
were
*NL*
questions
occupying
my
mind
so
busily
,
that
one
might
have
supposed
*NL*
there
could
be
no
more
room
in
it
for
any
other
theme
.
Even
when
I
*NL*
thought
of
Estella
,
and
how
we
had
parted
that
day
forever
,
and
when
*NL*
I
recalled
all
the
circumstances
of
our
parting
,
and
all
her
looks
and
*NL*
tones
,
and
the
action
of
her
fingers
while
she
knitted
,
--
even
then
I
*NL*
was
pursuing
,
here
and
there
and
everywhere
,
the
caution
,
Do
n't
go
home
.
*NL*
When
at
last
I
dozed
,
in
sheer
exhaustion
of
mind
and
body
,
it
became
*NL*
a
vast
shadowy
verb
which
I
had
to
conjugate
.
Imperative
mood
,
present
*NL*
tense
:
Do
not
thou
go
home
,
let
him
not
go
home
,
let
us
not
go
home
,
do
*NL*
not
ye
or
you
go
home
,
let
not
them
go
home
.
Then
potentially
:
I
may
not
*NL*
and
I
can
not
go
home
;
and
I
might
not
,
could
not
,
would
not
,
and
should
*NL*
not
go
home
;
until
I
felt
that
I
was
going
distracted
,
and
rolled
over
*NL*
on
the
pillow
,
and
looked
at
the
staring
rounds
upon
the
wall
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
left
directions
that
I
was
to
be
called
at
seven
;
for
it
was
plain
*NL*
that
I
must
see
Wemmick
before
seeing
any
one
else
,
and
equally
plain
*NL*
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
his
Walworth
sentiments
only
could
be
*NL*
taken
.
It
was
a
relief
to
get
out
of
the
room
where
the
night
had
been
*NL*
so
miserable
,
and
I
needed
no
second
knocking
at
the
door
to
startle
me
*NL*
from
my
uneasy
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Castle
battlements
arose
upon
my
view
at
eight
o'clock
.
The
little
*NL*
servant
happening
to
be
entering
the
fortress
with
two
hot
rolls
,
I
*NL*
passed
through
the
postern
and
crossed
the
drawbridge
in
her
company
,
*NL*
and
so
came
without
announcement
into
the
presence
of
Wemmick
as
he
was
*NL*
making
tea
for
himself
and
the
Aged
.
An
open
door
afforded
a
perspective
*NL*
view
of
the
Aged
in
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
,
Mr.
Pip
!
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
You
did
come
home
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
returned
;
``
but
I
did
n't
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
said
he
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
``
I
left
a
note
for
you
*NL*
at
each
of
the
Temple
gates
,
on
the
chance
.
Which
gate
did
you
come
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
round
to
the
others
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
destroy
the
*NL*
notes
,
''
said
Wemmick
;
``
it
's
a
good
rule
never
to
leave
documentary
*NL*
evidence
if
you
can
help
it
,
because
you
do
n't
know
when
it
may
be
put
*NL*
in
.
I
'm
going
to
take
a
liberty
with
you
.
Would
you
mind
toasting
this
*NL*
sausage
for
the
Aged
P.
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
should
be
delighted
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
can
go
about
your
work
,
Mary
Anne
,
''
said
Wemmick
to
the
little
*NL*
servant
;
``
which
leaves
us
to
ourselves
,
do
n't
you
see
,
Mr.
Pip
?
''
he
*NL*
added
,
winking
,
as
she
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
for
his
friendship
and
caution
,
and
our
discourse
*NL*
proceeded
in
a
low
tone
,
while
I
toasted
the
Aged
's
sausage
and
he
*NL*
buttered
the
crumb
of
the
Aged
's
roll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mr.
Pip
,
you
know
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
you
and
I
understand
one
*NL*
another
.
We
are
in
our
private
and
personal
capacities
,
and
we
have
been
*NL*
engaged
in
a
confidential
transaction
before
to-day
.
Official
sentiments
*NL*
are
one
thing
.
We
are
extra
official
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
cordially
assented
.
I
was
so
very
nervous
,
that
I
had
already
lighted
*NL*
the
Aged
's
sausage
like
a
torch
,
and
been
obliged
to
blow
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
accidentally
heard
,
yesterday
morning
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
being
in
a
*NL*
certain
place
where
I
once
took
you
,
--
even
between
you
and
me
,
it
's
as
*NL*
well
not
to
mention
names
when
avoidable
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
better
not
,
''
said
I.
``
I
understand
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
there
by
chance
,
yesterday
morning
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
that
*NL*
a
certain
person
not
altogether
of
uncolonial
pursuits
,
and
not
*NL*
unpossessed
of
portable
property
,
--
I
do
n't
know
who
it
may
really
*NL*
be
,
--
we
wo
n't
name
this
person

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
necessary
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Had
made
some
little
stir
in
a
certain
part
of
the
world
where
a
good
*NL*
many
people
go
,
not
always
in
gratification
of
their
own
inclinations
,
*NL*
and
not
quite
irrespective
of
the
government
expense
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
watching
his
face
,
I
made
quite
a
firework
of
the
Aged
's
sausage
,
*NL*
and
greatly
discomposed
both
my
own
attention
and
Wemmick
's
;
for
which
I
*NL*
apologized
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
By
disappearing
from
such
place
,
and
being
no
more
heard
of
*NL*
thereabouts
.
From
which
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
conjectures
had
been
raised
and
*NL*
theories
formed
.
I
also
heard
that
you
at
your
chambers
in
Garden
Court
,
*NL*
Temple
,
had
been
watched
,
and
might
be
watched
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
whom
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
go
into
that
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
evasively
,
``
it
might
clash
with
*NL*
official
responsibilities
.
I
heard
it
,
as
I
have
in
my
time
heard
other
*NL*
curious
things
in
the
same
place
.
I
do
n't
tell
it
you
on
information
*NL*
received
.
I
heard
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
toasting-fork
and
sausage
from
me
as
he
spoke
,
and
set
forth
*NL*
the
Aged
's
breakfast
neatly
on
a
little
tray
.
Previous
to
placing
it
*NL*
before
him
,
he
went
into
the
Aged
's
room
with
a
clean
white
cloth
,
and
*NL*
tied
the
same
under
the
old
gentleman
's
chin
,
and
propped
him
up
,
and
*NL*
put
his
nightcap
on
one
side
,
and
gave
him
quite
a
rakish
air
.
Then
he
*NL*
placed
his
breakfast
before
him
with
great
care
,
and
said
,
``
All
right
,
*NL*
ai
n't
you
,
Aged
P.
?
''
To
which
the
cheerful
Aged
replied
,
``
All
right
,
*NL*
John
,
my
boy
,
all
right
!
''
As
there
seemed
to
be
a
tacit
understanding
*NL*
that
the
Aged
was
not
in
a
presentable
state
,
and
was
therefore
to
be
*NL*
considered
invisible
,
I
made
a
pretence
of
being
in
complete
ignorance
*NL*
of
these
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
watching
of
me
at
my
chambers
-LRB-
which
I
have
once
had
reason
to
*NL*
suspect
-RRB-
,
''
I
said
to
Wemmick
when
he
came
back
,
``
is
inseparable
from
the
*NL*
person
to
whom
you
have
adverted
;
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
looked
very
serious
.
``
I
could
n't
undertake
to
say
that
,
of
my
*NL*
own
knowledge
.
I
mean
,
I
could
n't
undertake
to
say
it
was
at
first
.
But
*NL*
it
either
is
,
or
it
will
be
,
or
it
's
in
great
danger
of
being
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
saw
that
he
was
restrained
by
fealty
to
Little
Britain
from
saying
*NL*
as
much
as
he
could
,
and
as
I
knew
with
thankfulness
to
him
how
far
out
*NL*
of
his
way
he
went
to
say
what
he
did
,
I
could
not
press
him
.
But
I
told
*NL*
him
,
after
a
little
meditation
over
the
fire
,
that
I
would
like
to
ask
*NL*
him
a
question
,
subject
to
his
answering
or
not
answering
,
as
he
*NL*
deemed
right
,
and
sure
that
his
course
would
be
right
.
He
paused
in
his
*NL*
breakfast
,
and
crossing
his
arms
,
and
pinching
his
shirt-sleeves
-LRB-
his
*NL*
notion
of
in-door
comfort
was
to
sit
without
any
coat
-RRB-
,
he
nodded
to
me
*NL*
once
,
to
put
my
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
heard
of
a
man
of
bad
character
,
whose
true
name
is
*NL*
Compeyson
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
with
one
other
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
other
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
me
one
other
nod
,
compressed
the
post-office
exceedingly
,
gave
*NL*
me
one
last
nod
,
and
went
on
with
his
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
questioning
being
over
,
''
which
he
emphasized
and
*NL*
repeated
for
my
guidance
,
``
I
come
to
what
I
did
,
after
hearing
what
I
*NL*
heard
.
I
went
to
Garden
Court
to
find
you
;
not
finding
you
,
I
went
to
*NL*
Clarriker
's
to
find
Mr.
Herbert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
him
you
found
?
''
said
I
,
with
great
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
him
I
found
.
Without
mentioning
any
names
or
going
into
any
*NL*
details

I
gave
him
to
understand
that
if
he
was
aware
of
anybody
--
Tom
,
*NL*
Jack
,
or
Richard
--
being
about
the
chambers
,
or
about
the
immediate
*NL*
neighborhood
,
he
had
better
get
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
out
of
the
way
*NL*
while
you
were
out
of
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
be
greatly
puzzled
what
to
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
puzzled
what
to
do
;
not
the
less
,
because
I
gave
him
my
opinion

that
it
was
not
safe
to
try
to
get
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
too
far
out
*NL*
of
the
way
at
present
.
Mr.
Pip
,
I
'll
tell
you
something
.
Under
existing
*NL*
circumstances
,
there
is
no
place
like
a
great
city
when
you
are
once
*NL*
in
it
.
Do
n't
break
cover
too
soon
.
Lie
close
.
Wait
till
things
slacken
,
*NL*
before
you
try
the
open
,
even
for
foreign
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
for
his
valuable
advice
,
and
asked
him
what
Herbert
had
*NL*
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Herbert
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
after
being
all
of
a
heap
for
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
struck
out
a
plan
.
He
mentioned
to
me
as
a
secret
,
that
he
is
*NL*
courting
a
young
lady
who
has
,
as
no
doubt
you
are
aware
,
a
bedridden
*NL*
Pa.
.
Which
Pa
,
having
been
in
the
Purser
line
of
life
,
lies
a-bed
in
a
*NL*
bow-window
where
he
can
see
the
ships
sail
up
and
down
the
river
.
You
*NL*
are
acquainted
with
the
young
lady
,
most
probably
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
personally
,
''
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
was
,
that
she
had
objected
to
me
as
an
expensive
companion
*NL*
who
did
Herbert
no
good
,
and
that
,
when
Herbert
had
first
proposed
to
*NL*
present
me
to
her
,
she
had
received
the
proposal
with
such
very
moderate
*NL*
warmth
,
that
Herbert
had
felt
himself
obliged
to
confide
the
state
of
*NL*
the
case
to
me
,
with
a
view
to
the
lapse
of
a
little
time
before
I
made
*NL*
her
acquaintance
.
When
I
had
begun
to
advance
Herbert
's
prospects
by
*NL*
stealth
,
I
had
been
able
to
bear
this
with
cheerful
philosophy
:
he
and
*NL*
his
affianced
,
for
their
part
,
had
naturally
not
been
very
anxious
to
*NL*
introduce
a
third
person
into
their
interviews
;
and
thus
,
although
I
was
*NL*
assured
that
I
had
risen
in
Clara
's
esteem
,
and
although
the
young
*NL*
lady
and
I
had
long
regularly
interchanged
messages
and
remembrances
by
*NL*
Herbert
,
I
had
never
seen
her
.
However
,
I
did
not
trouble
Wemmick
with
*NL*
these
particulars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
with
the
bow-window
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
being
by
the
river-side
,
*NL*
down
the
Pool
there
between
Limehouse
and
Greenwich
,
and
being
kept
,
it
*NL*
seems
,
by
a
very
respectable
widow
who
has
a
furnished
upper
floor
to
*NL*
let
,
Mr.
Herbert
put
it
to
me
,
what
did
I
think
of
that
as
a
temporary
*NL*
tenement
for
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
?
Now
,
I
thought
very
well
of
it
,
for
*NL*
three
reasons
I
'll
give
you
.
That
is
to
say
:
Firstly
.
It
's
altogether
*NL*
out
of
all
your
beats
,
and
is
well
away
from
the
usual
heap
of
streets
*NL*
great
and
small
.
Secondly
.
Without
going
near
it
yourself
,
you
could
*NL*
always
hear
of
the
safety
of
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
,
through
Mr.
Herbert
.
*NL*
Thirdly
.
After
a
while
and
when
it
might
be
prudent
,
if
you
should
want
*NL*
to
slip
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
on
board
a
foreign
packet-boat
,
there
he
*NL*
is
--
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Much
comforted
by
these
considerations
,
I
thanked
Wemmick
again
and
*NL*
again
,
and
begged
him
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
!
Mr.
Herbert
threw
himself
into
the
business
with
a
will
,
and
*NL*
by
nine
o'clock
last
night
he
housed
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
,
--
whichever
*NL*
it
may
be
,
--
you
and
I
do
n't
want
to
know
,
--
quite
successfully
.
At
the
*NL*
old
lodgings
it
was
understood
that
he
was
summoned
to
Dover
,
and
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
he
was
taken
down
the
Dover
road
and
cornered
out
of
it
.
Now
,
*NL*
another
great
advantage
of
all
this
is
,
that
it
was
done
without
you
,
*NL*
and
when
,
if
any
one
was
concerning
himself
about
your
movements
,
you
*NL*
must
be
known
to
be
ever
so
many
miles
off
and
quite
otherwise
engaged
.
*NL*
This
diverts
suspicion
and
confuses
it
;
and
for
the
same
reason
I
*NL*
recommended
that
,
even
if
you
came
back
last
night
,
you
should
not
go
*NL*
home
.
It
brings
in
more
confusion
,
and
you
want
confusion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
,
having
finished
his
breakfast
,
here
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
*NL*
began
to
get
his
coat
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
said
he
,
with
his
hands
still
in
the
sleeves
,
``
I
*NL*
have
probably
done
the
most
I
can
do
;
but
if
I
can
ever
do
more
,
--
from
*NL*
a
Walworth
point
of
view
,
and
in
a
strictly
private
and
personal
*NL*
capacity
,
--
I
shall
be
glad
to
do
it
.
Here
's
the
address
.
There
can
be
*NL*
no
harm
in
your
going
here
to-night
,
and
seeing
for
yourself
that
all
is
*NL*
well
with
Tom
,
Jack
,
or
Richard
,
before
you
go
home
,
--
which
is
another
*NL*
reason
for
your
not
going
home
last
night
.
But
,
after
you
have
gone
*NL*
home
,
do
n't
go
back
here
.
You
are
very
welcome
,
I
am
sure
,
Mr.
Pip
''
;
his
*NL*
hands
were
now
out
of
his
sleeves
,
and
I
was
shaking
them
;
``
and
let
me
*NL*
finally
impress
one
important
point
upon
you
.
''
He
laid
his
hands
upon
*NL*
my
shoulders
,
and
added
in
a
solemn
whisper
:
``
Avail
yourself
of
this
*NL*
evening
to
lay
hold
of
his
portable
property
.
You
do
n't
know
what
may
*NL*
happen
to
him
.
Do
n't
let
anything
happen
to
the
portable
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
despairing
of
making
my
mind
clear
to
Wemmick
on
this
point
,
I
*NL*
forbore
to
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Time
's
up
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
and
I
must
be
off
.
If
you
had
nothing
more
*NL*
pressing
to
do
than
to
keep
here
till
dark
,
that
's
what
I
should
advise
.
*NL*
You
look
very
much
worried
,
and
it
would
do
you
good
to
have
a
perfectly
*NL*
quiet
day
with
the
Aged
,
--
he
'll
be
up
presently
,
--
and
a
little
bit
*NL*
of
--
you
remember
the
pig
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
and
a
little
bit
of
him
.
That
sausage
you
toasted
was
his
,
and
*NL*
he
was
in
all
respects
a
first-rater
.
Do
try
him
,
if
it
is
only
for
old
*NL*
acquaintance
sake
.
Good-bye
,
Aged
Parent
!
''
in
a
cheery
shout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
John
;
all
right
,
my
boy
!
''
piped
the
old
man
from
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
soon
fell
asleep
before
Wemmick
's
fire
,
and
the
Aged
and
I
enjoyed
one
*NL*
another
's
society
by
falling
asleep
before
it
more
or
less
all
day
.
*NL*
We
had
loin
of
pork
for
dinner
,
and
greens
grown
on
the
estate
;
and
*NL*
I
nodded
at
the
Aged
with
a
good
intention
whenever
I
failed
to
do
it
*NL*
drowsily
.
When
it
was
quite
dark
,
I
left
the
Aged
preparing
the
fire
for
*NL*
toast
;
and
I
inferred
from
the
number
of
teacups
,
as
well
as
from
his
*NL*
glances
at
the
two
little
doors
in
the
wall
,
that
Miss
Skiffins
was
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XLVI
*NL*
*NL*
Eight
o'clock
had
struck
before
I
got
into
the
air
,
that
was
scented
,
*NL*
not
disagreeably
,
by
the
chips
and
shavings
of
the
long-shore
*NL*
boat-builders
,
and
mast
,
oar
,
and
block
makers
.
All
that
water-side
*NL*
region
of
the
upper
and
lower
Pool
below
Bridge
was
unknown
ground
to
*NL*
me
;
and
when
I
struck
down
by
the
river
,
I
found
that
the
spot
I
wanted
*NL*
was
not
where
I
had
supposed
it
to
be
,
and
was
anything
but
easy
to
*NL*
find
.
It
was
called
Mill
Pond
Bank
,
Chinks
's
Basin
;
and
I
had
no
other
*NL*
guide
to
Chinks
's
Basin
than
the
Old
Green
Copper
Rope-walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
matters
not
what
stranded
ships
repairing
in
dry
docks
I
lost
myself
*NL*
among
,
what
old
hulls
of
ships
in
course
of
being
knocked
to
pieces
,
*NL*
what
ooze
and
slime
and
other
dregs
of
tide
,
what
yards
of
ship-builders
*NL*
and
ship-breakers
,
what
rusty
anchors
blindly
biting
into
the
ground
,
*NL*
though
for
years
off
duty
,
what
mountainous
country
of
accumulated
casks
*NL*
and
timber
,
how
many
rope-walks
that
were
not
the
Old
Green
Copper
.
After
*NL*
several
times
falling
short
of
my
destination
and
as
often
overshooting
*NL*
it
,
I
came
unexpectedly
round
a
corner
,
upon
Mill
Pond
Bank
.
It
was
a
*NL*
fresh
kind
of
place
,
all
circumstances
considered
,
where
the
wind
from
*NL*
the
river
had
room
to
turn
itself
round
;
and
there
were
two
or
three
*NL*
trees
in
it
,
and
there
was
the
stump
of
a
ruined
windmill
,
and
there
*NL*
was
the
Old
Green
Copper
Rope-walk
,
--
whose
long
and
narrow
vista
I
could
*NL*
trace
in
the
moonlight
,
along
a
series
of
wooden
frames
set
in
the
*NL*
ground
,
that
looked
like
superannuated
haymaking-rakes
which
had
grown
*NL*
old
and
lost
most
of
their
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Selecting
from
the
few
queer
houses
upon
Mill
Pond
Bank
a
house
with
a
*NL*
wooden
front
and
three
stories
of
bow-window
-LRB-
not
bay-window
,
which
is
*NL*
another
thing
-RRB-
,
I
looked
at
the
plate
upon
the
door
,
and
read
there
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Whimple
.
That
being
the
name
I
wanted
,
I
knocked
,
and
an
elderly
*NL*
woman
of
a
pleasant
and
thriving
appearance
responded
.
She
was
*NL*
immediately
deposed
,
however
,
by
Herbert
,
who
silently
led
me
into
*NL*
the
parlor
and
shut
the
door
.
It
was
an
odd
sensation
to
see
his
very
*NL*
familiar
face
established
quite
at
home
in
that
very
unfamiliar
room
*NL*
and
region
;
and
I
found
myself
looking
at
him
,
much
as
I
looked
at
*NL*
the
corner-cupboard
with
the
glass
and
china
,
the
shells
upon
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
and
the
colored
engravings
on
the
wall
,
representing
the
*NL*
death
of
Captain
Cook
,
a
ship-launch
,
and
his
Majesty
King
George
the
*NL*
Third
in
a
state
coachman
's
wig
,
leather-breeches
,
and
top-boots
,
on
the
*NL*
terrace
at
Windsor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
well
,
Handel
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
and
he
is
quite
satisfied
,
though
*NL*
eager
to
see
you
.
My
dear
girl
is
with
her
father
;
and
if
you
'll
wait
*NL*
till
she
comes
down
,
I
'll
make
you
known
to
her
,
and
then
we
'll
go
upstairs
.
That
's
her
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
become
aware
of
an
alarming
growling
overhead
,
and
had
probably
*NL*
expressed
the
fact
in
my
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
he
is
a
sad
old
rascal
,
''
said
Herbert
,
smiling
,
``
but
I
have
*NL*
never
seen
him
.
Do
n't
you
smell
rum
?
He
is
always
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
rum
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Herbert
,
``
and
you
may
suppose
how
mild
it
makes
his
*NL*
gout
.
He
persists
,
too
,
in
keeping
all
the
provisions
upstairs
in
his
*NL*
room
,
and
serving
them
out
.
He
keeps
them
on
shelves
over
his
head
,
and
*NL*
will
weigh
them
all
.
His
room
must
be
like
a
chandler
's
shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
thus
spoke
,
the
growling
noise
became
a
prolonged
roar
,
and
*NL*
then
died
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
can
be
the
consequence
,
''
said
Herbert
,
in
explanation
,
``
if
*NL*
he
will
cut
the
cheese
?
A
man
with
the
gout
in
his
right
hand
--
and
*NL*
everywhere
else
--
ca
n't
expect
to
get
through
a
Double
Gloucester
without
*NL*
hurting
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
have
hurt
himself
very
much
,
for
he
gave
another
furious
*NL*
roar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
have
Provis
for
an
upper
lodger
is
quite
a
godsend
to
Mrs.
Whimple
,
''
*NL*
said
Herbert
,
``
for
of
course
people
in
general
wo
n't
stand
that
noise
.
A
*NL*
curious
place
,
Handel
;
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
curious
place
,
indeed
;
but
remarkably
well
kept
and
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Whimple
,
''
said
Herbert
,
when
I
told
him
so
,
``
is
the
best
of
*NL*
housewives
,
and
I
really
do
not
know
what
my
Clara
would
do
without
*NL*
her
motherly
help
.
For
,
Clara
has
no
mother
of
her
own
,
Handel
,
and
no
*NL*
relation
in
the
world
but
old
Gruffandgrim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
that
's
not
his
name
,
Herbert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
that
's
my
name
for
him
.
His
name
is
Mr.
Barley
.
*NL*
But
what
a
blessing
it
is
for
the
son
of
my
father
and
mother
to
love
a
*NL*
girl
who
has
no
relations
,
and
who
can
never
bother
herself
or
anybody
*NL*
else
about
her
family
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
had
told
me
on
former
occasions
,
and
now
reminded
me
,
that
he
*NL*
first
knew
Miss
Clara
Barley
when
she
was
completing
her
education
at
*NL*
an
establishment
at
Hammersmith
,
and
that
on
her
being
recalled
home
*NL*
to
nurse
her
father
,
he
and
she
had
confided
their
affection
to
the
*NL*
motherly
Mrs.
Whimple
,
by
whom
it
had
been
fostered
and
regulated
*NL*
with
equal
kindness
and
discretion
,
ever
since
.
It
was
understood
that
*NL*
nothing
of
a
tender
nature
could
possibly
be
confided
to
old
Barley
,
by
*NL*
reason
of
his
being
totally
unequal
to
the
consideration
of
any
subject
*NL*
more
psychological
than
Gout
,
Rum
,
and
Purser
's
stores
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
thus
conversing
in
a
low
tone
while
Old
Barley
's
sustained
*NL*
growl
vibrated
in
the
beam
that
crossed
the
ceiling
,
the
room
door
*NL*
opened
,
and
a
very
pretty
,
slight
,
dark-eyed
girl
of
twenty
or
so
came
*NL*
in
with
a
basket
in
her
hand
:
whom
Herbert
tenderly
relieved
of
the
*NL*
basket
,
and
presented
,
blushing
,
as
``
Clara
.
''
She
really
was
a
most
*NL*
charming
girl
,
and
might
have
passed
for
a
captive
fairy
,
whom
that
*NL*
truculent
Ogre
,
Old
Barley
,
had
pressed
into
his
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
''
said
Herbert
,
showing
me
the
basket
,
with
a
compassionate
*NL*
and
tender
smile
,
after
we
had
talked
a
little
;
``
here
's
poor
Clara
's
*NL*
supper
,
served
out
every
night
.
Here
's
her
allowance
of
bread
,
and
*NL*
here
's
her
slice
of
cheese
,
and
here
's
her
rum
,
--
which
I
drink
.
This
*NL*
is
Mr.
Barley
's
breakfast
for
to-morrow
,
served
out
to
be
cooked
.
Two
*NL*
mutton-chops
,
three
potatoes
,
some
split
peas
,
a
little
flour
,
two
*NL*
ounces
of
butter
,
a
pinch
of
salt
,
and
all
this
black
pepper
.
It
's
*NL*
stewed
up
together
,
and
taken
hot
,
and
it
's
a
nice
thing
for
the
gout
,
I
*NL*
should
think
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
so
natural
and
winning
in
Clara
's
resigned
way
of
*NL*
looking
at
these
stores
in
detail
,
as
Herbert
pointed
them
out
;
and
*NL*
something
so
confiding
,
loving
,
and
innocent
in
her
modest
manner
of
*NL*
yielding
herself
to
Herbert
's
embracing
arm
;
and
something
so
gentle
in
*NL*
her
,
so
much
needing
protection
on
Mill
Pond
Bank
,
by
Chinks
's
Basin
,
*NL*
and
the
Old
Green
Copper
Rope-walk
,
with
Old
Barley
growling
in
the
*NL*
beam
,
--
that
I
would
not
have
undone
the
engagement
between
her
and
*NL*
Herbert
for
all
the
money
in
the
pocket-book
I
had
never
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
looking
at
her
with
pleasure
and
admiration
,
when
suddenly
the
*NL*
growl
swelled
into
a
roar
again
,
and
a
frightful
bumping
noise
was
heard
*NL*
above
,
as
if
a
giant
with
a
wooden
leg
were
trying
to
bore
it
through
*NL*
the
ceiling
to
come
at
us
.
Upon
this
Clara
said
to
Herbert
,
``
Papa
wants
*NL*
me
,
darling
!
''
and
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
an
unconscionable
old
shark
for
you
!
''
said
Herbert
.
``
What
do
*NL*
you
suppose
he
wants
now
,
Handel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
I.
``
Something
to
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
!
''
cried
Herbert
,
as
if
I
had
made
a
guess
of
extraordinary
*NL*
merit
.
``
He
keeps
his
grog
ready
mixed
in
a
little
tub
on
the
table
.
*NL*
Wait
a
moment
,
and
you
'll
hear
Clara
lift
him
up
to
take
some
.
There
*NL*
he
goes
!
''
Another
roar
,
with
a
prolonged
shake
at
the
end
.
``
Now
,
''
said
*NL*
Herbert
,
as
it
was
succeeded
by
silence
,
``
he
's
drinking
.
Now
,
''
said
*NL*
Herbert
,
as
the
growl
resounded
in
the
beam
once
more
,
``
he
's
down
again
*NL*
on
his
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
returned
soon
afterwards
,
and
Herbert
accompanied
me
upstairs
to
*NL*
see
our
charge
.
As
we
passed
Mr.
Barley
's
door
,
he
was
heard
hoarsely
*NL*
muttering
within
,
in
a
strain
that
rose
and
fell
like
wind
,
the
*NL*
following
Refrain
,
in
which
I
substitute
good
wishes
for
something
quite
*NL*
the
reverse
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ahoy
!
Bless
your
eyes
,
here
's
old
Bill
Barley
.
Here
's
old
Bill
Barley
,
*NL*
bless
your
eyes
.
Here
's
old
Bill
Barley
on
the
flat
of
his
back
,
by
the
*NL*
Lord
.
Lying
on
the
flat
of
his
back
like
a
drifting
old
dead
flounder
,
*NL*
here
's
your
old
Bill
Barley
,
bless
your
eyes
.
Ahoy
!
Bless
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
strain
of
consolation
,
Herbert
informed
me
the
invisible
Barley
*NL*
would
commune
with
himself
by
the
day
and
night
together
;
Often
,
while
*NL*
it
was
light
,
having
,
at
the
same
time
,
one
eye
at
a
telescope
which
was
*NL*
fitted
on
his
bed
for
the
convenience
of
sweeping
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
two
cabin
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
which
were
fresh
and
*NL*
airy
,
and
in
which
Mr.
Barley
was
less
audible
than
below
,
I
found
*NL*
Provis
comfortably
settled
.
He
expressed
no
alarm
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
feel
none
that
was
worth
mentioning
;
but
it
struck
me
that
he
was
*NL*
softened
,
--
indefinably
,
for
I
could
not
have
said
how
,
and
could
never
*NL*
afterwards
recall
how
when
I
tried
,
but
certainly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
opportunity
that
the
day
's
rest
had
given
me
for
reflection
had
*NL*
resulted
in
my
fully
determining
to
say
nothing
to
him
respecting
*NL*
Compeyson
.
For
anything
I
knew
,
his
animosity
towards
the
man
*NL*
might
otherwise
lead
to
his
seeking
him
out
and
rushing
on
his
own
*NL*
destruction
.
Therefore
,
when
Herbert
and
I
sat
down
with
him
by
his
*NL*
fire
,
I
asked
him
first
of
all
whether
he
relied
on
Wemmick
's
judgment
*NL*
and
sources
of
information
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
dear
boy
!
''
he
answered
,
with
a
grave
nod
,
``
Jaggers
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
I
have
talked
with
Wemmick
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
have
come
to
tell
you
*NL*
what
caution
he
gave
me
and
what
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
did
accurately
,
with
the
reservation
just
mentioned
;
and
I
told
*NL*
him
how
Wemmick
had
heard
,
in
Newgate
prison
-LRB-
whether
from
officers
or
*NL*
prisoners
I
could
not
say
-RRB-
,
that
he
was
under
some
suspicion
,
and
that
*NL*
my
chambers
had
been
watched
;
how
Wemmick
had
recommended
his
keeping
*NL*
close
for
a
time
,
and
my
keeping
away
from
him
;
and
what
Wemmick
had
*NL*
said
about
getting
him
abroad
.
I
added
,
that
of
course
,
when
the
time
*NL*
came
,
I
should
go
with
him
,
or
should
follow
close
upon
him
,
as
might
*NL*
be
safest
in
Wemmick
's
judgment
.
What
was
to
follow
that
I
did
not
touch
*NL*
upon
;
neither
,
indeed
,
was
I
at
all
clear
or
comfortable
about
it
in
my
*NL*
own
mind
,
now
that
I
saw
him
in
that
softer
condition
,
and
in
declared
*NL*
peril
for
my
sake
.
As
to
altering
my
way
of
living
by
enlarging
my
*NL*
expenses
,
I
put
it
to
him
whether
in
our
present
unsettled
and
difficult
*NL*
circumstances
,
it
would
not
be
simply
ridiculous
,
if
it
were
no
worse
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
deny
this
,
and
indeed
was
very
reasonable
throughout
.
His
*NL*
coming
back
was
a
venture
,
he
said
,
and
he
had
always
known
it
to
be
a
*NL*
venture
.
He
would
do
nothing
to
make
it
a
desperate
venture
,
and
he
had
*NL*
very
little
fear
of
his
safety
with
such
good
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
,
who
had
been
looking
at
the
fire
and
pondering
,
here
said
*NL*
that
something
had
come
into
his
thoughts
arising
out
of
Wemmick
's
*NL*
suggestion
,
which
it
might
be
worth
while
to
pursue
.
``
We
are
both
good
*NL*
watermen
,
Handel
,
and
could
take
him
down
the
river
ourselves
when
the
*NL*
right
time
comes
.
No
boat
would
then
be
hired
for
the
purpose
,
and
no
*NL*
boatmen
;
that
would
save
at
least
a
chance
of
suspicion
,
and
any
chance
*NL*
is
worth
saving
.
Never
mind
the
season
;
do
n't
you
think
it
might
be
a
*NL*
good
thing
if
you
began
at
once
to
keep
a
boat
at
the
Temple
stairs
,
and
*NL*
were
in
the
habit
of
rowing
up
and
down
the
river
?
You
fall
into
that
*NL*
habit
,
and
then
who
notices
or
minds
?
Do
it
twenty
or
fifty
times
,
*NL*
and
there
is
nothing
special
in
your
doing
it
the
twenty-first
or
*NL*
fifty-first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
liked
this
scheme
,
and
Provis
was
quite
elated
by
it
.
We
agreed
*NL*
that
it
should
be
carried
into
execution
,
and
that
Provis
should
never
*NL*
recognize
us
if
we
came
below
Bridge
,
and
rowed
past
Mill
Pond
Bank
.
But
*NL*
we
further
agreed
that
he
should
pull
down
the
blind
in
that
part
of
his
*NL*
window
which
gave
upon
the
east
,
whenever
he
saw
us
and
all
was
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
conference
being
now
ended
,
and
everything
arranged
,
I
rose
to
go
;
*NL*
remarking
to
Herbert
that
he
and
I
had
better
not
go
home
together
,
and
*NL*
that
I
would
take
half
an
hour
's
start
of
him
.
``
I
do
n't
like
to
leave
*NL*
you
here
,
''
I
said
to
Provis
,
``
though
I
can
not
doubt
your
being
safer
*NL*
here
than
near
me
.
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
boy
,
''
he
answered
,
clasping
my
hands
,
``
I
do
n't
know
when
we
may
*NL*
meet
again
,
and
I
do
n't
like
good-bye
.
Say
good
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
!
Herbert
will
go
regularly
between
us
,
and
when
the
time
*NL*
comes
you
may
be
certain
I
shall
be
ready
.
Good
night
,
good
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
thought
it
best
that
he
should
stay
in
his
own
rooms
;
and
we
left
him
*NL*
on
the
landing
outside
his
door
,
holding
a
light
over
the
stair-rail
to
*NL*
light
us
downstairs
.
Looking
back
at
him
,
I
thought
of
the
first
night
*NL*
of
his
return
,
when
our
positions
were
reversed
,
and
when
I
little
*NL*
supposed
my
heart
could
ever
be
as
heavy
and
anxious
at
parting
from
him
*NL*
as
it
was
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Barley
was
growling
and
swearing
when
we
repassed
his
door
,
with
no
*NL*
appearance
of
having
ceased
or
of
meaning
to
cease
.
When
we
got
to
the
*NL*
foot
of
the
stairs
,
I
asked
Herbert
whether
he
had
preserved
the
name
of
*NL*
Provis
.
He
replied
,
certainly
not
,
and
that
the
lodger
was
Mr.
Campbell
.
*NL*
He
also
explained
that
the
utmost
known
of
Mr.
Campbell
there
was
,
*NL*
that
he
-LRB-
Herbert
-RRB-
had
Mr.
Campbell
consigned
to
him
,
and
felt
a
strong
*NL*
personal
interest
in
his
being
well
cared
for
,
and
living
a
secluded
*NL*
life
.
So
,
when
we
went
into
the
parlor
where
Mrs.
Whimple
and
Clara
were
*NL*
seated
at
work
,
I
said
nothing
of
my
own
interest
in
Mr.
Campbell
,
but
*NL*
kept
it
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
taken
leave
of
the
pretty
,
gentle
,
dark-eyed
girl
,
and
of
the
*NL*
motherly
woman
who
had
not
outlived
her
honest
sympathy
with
a
little
*NL*
affair
of
true
love
,
I
felt
as
if
the
Old
Green
Copper
Rope-walk
had
*NL*
grown
quite
a
different
place
.
Old
Barley
might
be
as
old
as
the
hills
,
*NL*
and
might
swear
like
a
whole
field
of
troopers
,
but
there
were
redeeming
*NL*
youth
and
trust
and
hope
enough
in
Chinks
's
Basin
to
fill
it
to
*NL*
overflowing
.
And
then
I
thought
of
Estella
,
and
of
our
parting
,
and
went
*NL*
home
very
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
things
were
as
quiet
in
the
Temple
as
ever
I
had
seen
them
.
The
*NL*
windows
of
the
rooms
on
that
side
,
lately
occupied
by
Provis
,
were
dark
*NL*
and
still
,
and
there
was
no
lounger
in
Garden
Court
.
I
walked
past
the
*NL*
fountain
twice
or
thrice
before
I
descended
the
steps
that
were
between
*NL*
me
and
my
rooms
,
but
I
was
quite
alone
.
Herbert
,
coming
to
my
*NL*
bedside
when
he
came
in
,
--
for
I
went
straight
to
bed
,
dispirited
and
*NL*
fatigued
,
--
made
the
same
report
.
Opening
one
of
the
windows
after
that
,
*NL*
he
looked
out
into
the
moonlight
,
and
told
me
that
the
pavement
was
as
*NL*
solemnly
empty
as
the
pavement
of
any
cathedral
at
that
same
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
I
set
myself
to
get
the
boat
.
It
was
soon
done
,
and
the
boat
*NL*
was
brought
round
to
the
Temple
stairs
,
and
lay
where
I
could
reach
*NL*
her
within
a
minute
or
two
.
Then
,
I
began
to
go
out
as
for
training
and
*NL*
practice
:
sometimes
alone
,
sometimes
with
Herbert
.
I
was
often
out
in
*NL*
cold
,
rain
,
and
sleet
,
but
nobody
took
much
note
of
me
after
I
had
been
*NL*
out
a
few
times
.
At
first
,
I
kept
above
Blackfriars
Bridge
;
but
as
the
*NL*
hours
of
the
tide
changed
,
I
took
towards
London
Bridge
.
It
was
Old
*NL*
London
Bridge
in
those
days
,
and
at
certain
states
of
the
tide
there
*NL*
was
a
race
and
fall
of
water
there
which
gave
it
a
bad
reputation
.
But
I
*NL*
knew
well
enough
how
to
`
shoot
'
the
bridge
after
seeing
it
done
,
and
so
*NL*
began
to
row
about
among
the
shipping
in
the
Pool
,
and
down
to
Erith
.
*NL*
The
first
time
I
passed
Mill
Pond
Bank
,
Herbert
and
I
were
pulling
a
*NL*
pair
of
oars
;
and
,
both
in
going
and
returning
,
we
saw
the
blind
towards
*NL*
the
east
come
down
.
Herbert
was
rarely
there
less
frequently
than
three
*NL*
times
in
a
week
,
and
he
never
brought
me
a
single
word
of
intelligence
*NL*
that
was
at
all
alarming
.
Still
,
I
knew
that
there
was
cause
for
alarm
,
*NL*
and
I
could
not
get
rid
of
the
notion
of
being
watched
.
Once
received
,
*NL*
it
is
a
haunting
idea
;
how
many
undesigning
persons
I
suspected
of
*NL*
watching
me
,
it
would
be
hard
to
calculate
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
was
always
full
of
fears
for
the
rash
man
who
was
in
hiding
.
*NL*
Herbert
had
sometimes
said
to
me
that
he
found
it
pleasant
to
stand
at
*NL*
one
of
our
windows
after
dark
,
when
the
tide
was
running
down
,
and
to
*NL*
think
that
it
was
flowing
,
with
everything
it
bore
,
towards
Clara
.
But
*NL*
I
thought
with
dread
that
it
was
flowing
towards
Magwitch
,
and
that
*NL*
any
black
mark
on
its
surface
might
be
his
pursuers
,
going
swiftly
,
*NL*
silently
,
and
surely
,
to
take
him
.

Chapter
XLVII
*NL*
*NL*
Some
weeks
passed
without
bringing
any
change
.
We
waited
for
Wemmick
,
*NL*
and
he
made
no
sign
.
If
I
had
never
known
him
out
of
Little
Britain
,
and
*NL*
had
never
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
being
on
a
familiar
footing
at
the
*NL*
Castle
,
I
might
have
doubted
him
;
not
so
for
a
moment
,
knowing
him
as
I
*NL*
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
worldly
affairs
began
to
wear
a
gloomy
appearance
,
and
I
was
pressed
*NL*
for
money
by
more
than
one
creditor
.
Even
I
myself
began
to
know
the
*NL*
want
of
money
-LRB-
I
mean
of
ready
money
in
my
own
pocket
-RRB-
,
and
to
relieve
*NL*
it
by
converting
some
easily
spared
articles
of
jewelery
into
cash
.
But
*NL*
I
had
quite
determined
that
it
would
be
a
heartless
fraud
to
take
more
*NL*
money
from
my
patron
in
the
existing
state
of
my
uncertain
thoughts
and
*NL*
plans
.
Therefore
,
I
had
sent
him
the
unopened
pocket-book
by
Herbert
,
to
*NL*
hold
in
his
own
keeping
,
and
I
felt
a
kind
of
satisfaction
--
whether
it
*NL*
was
a
false
kind
or
a
true
,
I
hardly
know
--
in
not
having
profited
by
his
*NL*
generosity
since
his
revelation
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
time
wore
on
,
an
impression
settled
heavily
upon
me
that
Estella
*NL*
was
married
.
Fearful
of
having
it
confirmed
,
though
it
was
all
but
a
*NL*
conviction
,
I
avoided
the
newspapers
,
and
begged
Herbert
-LRB-
to
whom
I
had
*NL*
confided
the
circumstances
of
our
last
interview
-RRB-
never
to
speak
of
her
*NL*
to
me
.
Why
I
hoarded
up
this
last
wretched
little
rag
of
the
robe
of
*NL*
hope
that
was
rent
and
given
to
the
winds
,
how
do
I
know
?
Why
did
you
*NL*
who
read
this
,
commit
that
not
dissimilar
inconsistency
of
your
own
last
*NL*
year
,
last
month
,
last
week
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
unhappy
life
that
I
lived
;
and
its
one
dominant
anxiety
,
*NL*
towering
over
all
its
other
anxieties
,
like
a
high
mountain
above
a
*NL*
range
of
mountains
,
never
disappeared
from
my
view
.
Still
,
no
new
cause
*NL*
for
fear
arose
.
Let
me
start
from
my
bed
as
I
would
,
with
the
terror
*NL*
fresh
upon
me
that
he
was
discovered
;
let
me
sit
listening
,
as
I
would
*NL*
with
dread
,
for
Herbert
's
returning
step
at
night
,
lest
it
should
be
*NL*
fleeter
than
ordinary
,
and
winged
with
evil
news
,
--
for
all
that
,
and
*NL*
much
more
to
like
purpose
,
the
round
of
things
went
on
.
Condemned
to
*NL*
inaction
and
a
state
of
constant
restlessness
and
suspense
,
I
rowed
*NL*
about
in
my
boat
,
and
waited
,
waited
,
waited
,
as
I
best
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
states
of
the
tide
when
,
having
been
down
the
river
,
I
could
*NL*
not
get
back
through
the
eddy-chafed
arches
and
starlings
of
old
London
*NL*
Bridge
;
then
,
I
left
my
boat
at
a
wharf
near
the
Custom
House
,
to
be
*NL*
brought
up
afterwards
to
the
Temple
stairs
.
I
was
not
averse
to
doing
*NL*
this
,
as
it
served
to
make
me
and
my
boat
a
commoner
incident
among
the
*NL*
water-side
people
there
.
From
this
slight
occasion
sprang
two
meetings
*NL*
that
I
have
now
to
tell
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
late
in
the
month
of
February
,
I
came
ashore
at
the
wharf
*NL*
at
dusk
.
I
had
pulled
down
as
far
as
Greenwich
with
the
ebb
tide
,
and
*NL*
had
turned
with
the
tide
.
It
had
been
a
fine
bright
day
,
but
had
become
*NL*
foggy
as
the
sun
dropped
,
and
I
had
had
to
feel
my
way
back
among
the
*NL*
shipping
,
pretty
carefully
.
Both
in
going
and
returning
,
I
had
seen
the
*NL*
signal
in
his
window
,
All
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
was
a
raw
evening
,
and
I
was
cold
,
I
thought
I
would
comfort
*NL*
myself
with
dinner
at
once
;
and
as
I
had
hours
of
dejection
and
solitude
*NL*
before
me
if
I
went
home
to
the
Temple
,
I
thought
I
would
afterwards
go
*NL*
to
the
play
.
The
theatre
where
Mr.
Wopsle
had
achieved
his
questionable
*NL*
triumph
was
in
that
water-side
neighborhood
-LRB-
it
is
nowhere
now
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
to
that
theatre
I
resolved
to
go
.
I
was
aware
that
Mr.
Wopsle
had
*NL*
not
succeeded
in
reviving
the
Drama
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
rather
*NL*
partaken
of
its
decline
.
He
had
been
ominously
heard
of
,
through
the
*NL*
play-bills
,
as
a
faithful
Black
,
in
connection
with
a
little
girl
of
*NL*
noble
birth
,
and
a
monkey
.
And
Herbert
had
seen
him
as
a
predatory
*NL*
Tartar
of
comic
propensities
,
with
a
face
like
a
red
brick
,
and
an
*NL*
outrageous
hat
all
over
bells
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dined
at
what
Herbert
and
I
used
to
call
a
geographical
chop-house
,
*NL*
where
there
were
maps
of
the
world
in
porter-pot
rims
on
every
half-yard
*NL*
of
the
tablecloths
,
and
charts
of
gravy
on
every
one
of
the
knives
,
--
to
*NL*
this
day
there
is
scarcely
a
single
chop-house
within
the
Lord
Mayor
's
*NL*
dominions
which
is
not
geographical
,
--
and
wore
out
the
time
in
dozing
*NL*
over
crumbs
,
staring
at
gas
,
and
baking
in
a
hot
blast
of
dinners
.
By
*NL*
and
by
,
I
roused
myself
,
and
went
to
the
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
I
found
a
virtuous
boatswain
in
His
Majesty
's
service
,
--
a
most
*NL*
excellent
man
,
though
I
could
have
wished
his
trousers
not
quite
so
*NL*
tight
in
some
places
,
and
not
quite
so
loose
in
others
,
--
who
knocked
all
*NL*
the
little
men
's
hats
over
their
eyes
,
though
he
was
very
generous
and
*NL*
brave
,
and
who
would
n't
hear
of
anybody
's
paying
taxes
,
though
he
was
*NL*
very
patriotic
.
He
had
a
bag
of
money
in
his
pocket
,
like
a
pudding
in
*NL*
the
cloth
,
and
on
that
property
married
a
young
person
in
bed-furniture
,
*NL*
with
great
rejoicings
;
the
whole
population
of
Portsmouth
-LRB-
nine
in
*NL*
number
at
the
last
census
-RRB-
turning
out
on
the
beach
to
rub
their
own
*NL*
hands
and
shake
everybody
else
's
,
and
sing
``
Fill
,
fill
!
''
A
certain
*NL*
dark-complexioned
Swab
,
however
,
who
would
n't
fill
,
or
do
anything
else
*NL*
that
was
proposed
to
him
,
and
whose
heart
was
openly
stated
-LRB-
by
the
*NL*
boatswain
-RRB-
to
be
as
black
as
his
figure-head
,
proposed
to
two
other
*NL*
Swabs
to
get
all
mankind
into
difficulties
;
which
was
so
effectually
*NL*
done
-LRB-
the
Swab
family
having
considerable
political
influence
-RRB-
that
it
*NL*
took
half
the
evening
to
set
things
right
,
and
then
it
was
only
brought
*NL*
about
through
an
honest
little
grocer
with
a
white
hat
,
black
gaiters
,
*NL*
and
red
nose
,
getting
into
a
clock
,
with
a
gridiron
,
and
listening
,
and
*NL*
coming
out
,
and
knocking
everybody
down
from
behind
with
the
gridiron
*NL*
whom
he
could
n't
confute
with
what
he
had
overheard
.
This
led
to
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
's
-LRB-
who
had
never
been
heard
of
before
-RRB-
coming
in
with
a
star
*NL*
and
garter
on
,
as
a
plenipotentiary
of
great
power
direct
from
the
*NL*
Admiralty
,
to
say
that
the
Swabs
were
all
to
go
to
prison
on
the
spot
,
*NL*
and
that
he
had
brought
the
boatswain
down
the
Union
Jack
,
as
a
slight
*NL*
acknowledgment
of
his
public
services
.
The
boatswain
,
unmanned
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
respectfully
dried
his
eyes
on
the
Jack
,
and
then
cheering
*NL*
up
,
and
addressing
Mr.
Wopsle
as
Your
Honor
,
solicited
permission
to
*NL*
take
him
by
the
fin
.
Mr.
Wopsle
,
conceding
his
fin
with
a
gracious
*NL*
dignity
,
was
immediately
shoved
into
a
dusty
corner
,
while
everybody
*NL*
danced
a
hornpipe
;
and
from
that
corner
,
surveying
the
public
with
a
*NL*
discontented
eye
,
became
aware
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
piece
was
the
last
new
grand
comic
Christmas
pantomime
,
in
*NL*
the
first
scene
of
which
,
it
pained
me
to
suspect
that
I
detected
*NL*
Mr.
Wopsle
with
red
worsted
legs
under
a
highly
magnified
phosphoric
*NL*
countenance
and
a
shock
of
red
curtain-fringe
for
his
hair
,
engaged
*NL*
in
the
manufacture
of
thunderbolts
in
a
mine
,
and
displaying
great
*NL*
cowardice
when
his
gigantic
master
came
home
-LRB-
very
hoarse
-RRB-
to
dinner
.
*NL*
But
he
presently
presented
himself
under
worthier
circumstances
;
for
,
*NL*
the
Genius
of
Youthful
Love
being
in
want
of
assistance
,
--
on
account
of
*NL*
the
parental
brutality
of
an
ignorant
farmer
who
opposed
the
choice
*NL*
of
his
daughter
's
heart
,
by
purposely
falling
upon
the
object
,
in
a
*NL*
flour-sack
,
out
of
the
first-floor
window
,
--
summoned
a
sententious
*NL*
Enchanter
;
and
he
,
coming
up
from
the
antipodes
rather
unsteadily
,
after
*NL*
an
apparently
violent
journey
,
proved
to
be
Mr.
Wopsle
in
a
high-crowned
*NL*
hat
,
with
a
necromantic
work
in
one
volume
under
his
arm
.
The
business
*NL*
of
this
enchanter
on
earth
being
principally
to
be
talked
at
,
sung
at
,
*NL*
butted
at
,
danced
at
,
and
flashed
at
with
fires
of
various
colors
,
*NL*
he
had
a
good
deal
of
time
on
his
hands
.
And
I
observed
,
with
great
*NL*
surprise
,
that
he
devoted
it
to
staring
in
my
direction
as
if
he
were
*NL*
lost
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
so
remarkable
in
the
increasing
glare
of
Mr.
*NL*
Wopsle
's
eye
,
and
he
seemed
to
be
turning
so
many
things
over
in
his
*NL*
mind
and
to
grow
so
confused
,
that
I
could
not
make
it
out
.
I
sat
*NL*
thinking
of
it
long
after
he
had
ascended
to
the
clouds
in
a
large
*NL*
watch-case
,
and
still
I
could
not
make
it
out
.
I
was
still
thinking
*NL*
of
it
when
I
came
out
of
the
theatre
an
hour
afterwards
,
and
found
him
*NL*
waiting
for
me
near
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
?
''
said
I
,
shaking
hands
with
him
as
we
turned
down
the
*NL*
street
together
.
``
I
saw
that
you
saw
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saw
you
,
Mr.
Pip
!
''
he
returned
.
``
Yes
,
of
course
I
saw
you
.
But
who
else
*NL*
was
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
strangest
thing
,
''
said
Mr.
Wopsle
,
drifting
into
his
lost
*NL*
look
again
;
``
and
yet
I
could
swear
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Becoming
alarmed
,
I
entreated
Mr.
Wopsle
to
explain
his
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
I
should
have
noticed
him
at
first
but
for
your
being
there
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Wopsle
,
going
on
in
the
same
lost
way
,
``
I
ca
n't
be
positive
;
*NL*
yet
I
think
I
should
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Involuntarily
I
looked
round
me
,
as
I
was
accustomed
to
look
round
me
*NL*
when
I
went
home
;
for
these
mysterious
words
gave
me
a
chill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
He
ca
n't
be
in
sight
,
''
said
Mr.
Wopsle
.
``
He
went
out
before
I
went
*NL*
off
.
I
saw
him
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
the
reason
that
I
had
for
being
suspicious
,
I
even
suspected
*NL*
this
poor
actor
.
I
mistrusted
a
design
to
entrap
me
into
some
admission
.
*NL*
Therefore
I
glanced
at
him
as
we
walked
on
together
,
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
ridiculous
fancy
that
he
must
be
with
you
,
Mr.
Pip
,
till
I
saw
*NL*
that
you
were
quite
unconscious
of
him
,
sitting
behind
you
there
like
a
*NL*
ghost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
former
chill
crept
over
me
again
,
but
I
was
resolved
not
to
speak
*NL*
yet
,
for
it
was
quite
consistent
with
his
words
that
he
might
be
set
on
*NL*
to
induce
me
to
connect
these
references
with
Provis
.
Of
course
,
I
was
*NL*
perfectly
sure
and
safe
that
Provis
had
not
been
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
wonder
at
me
,
Mr.
Pip
;
indeed
,
I
see
you
do
.
But
it
is
*NL*
so
very
strange
!
You
'll
hardly
believe
what
I
am
going
to
tell
you
.
I
*NL*
could
hardly
believe
it
myself
,
if
you
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
.
Mr.
Pip
,
you
remember
in
old
times
a
certain
Christmas
Day
,
*NL*
when
you
were
quite
a
child
,
and
I
dined
at
Gargery
's
,
and
some
soldiers
*NL*
came
to
the
door
to
get
a
pair
of
handcuffs
mended
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
it
very
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
remember
that
there
was
a
chase
after
two
convicts
,
and
that
we
*NL*
joined
in
it

that
Gargery
took
you
on
his
back
,
and
that
I
took
the
*NL*
lead

you
kept
up
with
me
as
well
as
you
could
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
it
all
very
well

Better
than
he
thought
,

except
the
last
*NL*
clause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
remember
that
we
came
up
with
the
two
in
a
ditch

that

there
was
a
scuffle
between
them
,
and
that

been
severely
*NL*
handled

much
mauled
about

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
it
all
before
me

*NL*
``
And
that

soldiers
lighted
torches

went
on
to
see
the
last
of

over

with
the
torchlight
shining
on

am
particular
about

torchlight

was
an

outer
ring

dark
night
all
about
us

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
I.

I
remember
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Mr.

him

your

``
Steady

asked
him
then

said

nothing

I
can
not
exaggerate
the
enhanced
disquiet

this
conversation

threw
me

the
special

peculiar
terror
I
felt
at
Compeyson
's
*NL*
having
been
behind
me
``
like
a
ghost
.
''
For
if
he
had
ever
been
out
of
my
*NL*
thoughts
for
a
few
moments
together
since
the
hiding
had
begun
,
it
was
*NL*
in
those
very
moments
when
he
was
closest
to
me
;
and
to
think
that
I
*NL*
should
be
so
unconscious
and
off
my
guard
after
all
my
care
was
as
if
*NL*
I
had
shut
an
avenue
of
a
hundred
doors
to
keep
him
out
,
and
then
had
*NL*
found
him
at
my
elbow
.
I
could
not
doubt
,
either
,
that
he
was
there
,
*NL*
because
I
was
there
,
and
that
,
however
slight
an
appearance
of
danger
*NL*
there
might
be
about
us
,
danger
was
always
near
and
active
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
such
questions
to
Mr.
Wopsle
as
,
When
did
the
man
come
in
?
He
*NL*
could
not
tell
me
that
;
he
saw
me
,
and
over
my
shoulder
he
saw
the
man
.
*NL*
It
was
not
until
he
had
seen
him
for
some
time
that
he
began
to
identify
*NL*
him
;
but
he
had
from
the
first
vaguely
associated
him
with
me
,
and
*NL*
known
him
as
somehow
belonging
to
me
in
the
old
village
time
.
How
was
*NL*
he
dressed
?
Prosperously
,
but
not
noticeably
otherwise
;
he
thought
,
in
*NL*
black
.
Was
his
face
at
all
disfigured
?
No
,
he
believed
not
.
I
believed
*NL*
not
too
,
for
,
although
in
my
brooding
state
I
had
taken
no
especial
*NL*
notice
of
the
people
behind
me
,
I
thought
it
likely
that
a
face
at
all
*NL*
disfigured
would
have
attracted
my
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Wopsle
had
imparted
to
me
all
that
he
could
recall
or
I
*NL*
extract
,
and
when
I
had
treated
him
to
a
little
appropriate
refreshment
,
*NL*
after
the
fatigues
of
the
evening
,
we
parted
.
It
was
between
twelve
and
*NL*
one
o'clock
when
I
reached
the
Temple
,
and
the
gates
were
shut
.
No
one
*NL*
was
near
me
when
I
went
in
and
went
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
had
come
in
,
and
we
held
a
very
serious
council
by
the
fire
.
But
*NL*
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
,
saving
to
communicate
to
Wemmick
what
I
*NL*
had
that
night
found
out
,
and
to
remind
him
that
we
waited
for
his
hint
.
*NL*
As
I
thought
that
I
might
compromise
him
if
I
went
too
often
to
the
*NL*
Castle
,
I
made
this
communication
by
letter
.
I
wrote
it
before
I
went
to
*NL*
bed
,
and
went
out
and
posted
it
;
and
again
no
one
was
near
me
.
Herbert
*NL*
and
I
agreed
that
we
could
do
nothing
else
but
be
very
cautious
.
And
*NL*
we
were
very
cautious
indeed
,
--
more
cautious
than
before
,
if
that
were
*NL*
possible
,
--
and
I
for
my
part
never
went
near
Chinks
's
Basin
,
except
*NL*
when
I
rowed
by
,
and
then
I
only
looked
at
Mill
Pond
Bank
as
I
looked
at
*NL*
anything
else
.

Chapter
XLVIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
of
the
two
meetings
referred
to
in
the
last
chapter
occurred
*NL*
about
a
week
after
the
first
.
I
had
again
left
my
boat
at
the
wharf
*NL*
below
Bridge
;
the
time
was
an
hour
earlier
in
the
afternoon
;
and
,
*NL*
undecided
where
to
dine
,
I
had
strolled
up
into
Cheapside
,
and
was
*NL*
strolling
along
it
,
surely
the
most
unsettled
person
in
all
the
busy
*NL*
concourse
,
when
a
large
hand
was
laid
upon
my
shoulder
by
some
one
*NL*
overtaking
me
.
It
was
Mr.
Jaggers
's
hand
,
and
he
passed
it
through
my
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
we
are
going
in
the
same
direction
,
Pip
,
we
may
walk
together
.
Where
*NL*
are
you
bound
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
Temple
,
I
think
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
returned
,
glad
for
once
to
get
the
better
of
him
in
*NL*
cross-examination
,
``
I
do
not
know
,
for
I
have
not
made
up
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
to
dine
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
You
do
n't
mind
admitting
*NL*
that
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
returned
,
``
I
do
n't
mind
admitting
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
not
engaged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
admitting
also
that
I
am
not
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
come
and
dine
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
to
excuse
myself
,
when
he
added
,
``
Wemmick
's
coming
.
''
So
*NL*
I
changed
my
excuse
into
an
acceptance
,
--
the
few
words
I
had
uttered
,
*NL*
serving
for
the
beginning
of
either
,
--
and
we
went
along
Cheapside
*NL*
and
slanted
off
to
Little
Britain
,
while
the
lights
were
springing
up
*NL*
brilliantly
in
the
shop
windows
,
and
the
street
lamp-lighters
,
scarcely
*NL*
finding
ground
enough
to
plant
their
ladders
on
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
's
bustle
,
were
skipping
up
and
down
and
running
in
and
out
,
*NL*
opening
more
red
eyes
in
the
gathering
fog
than
my
rushlight
tower
at
*NL*
the
Hummums
had
opened
white
eyes
in
the
ghostly
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
office
in
Little
Britain
there
was
the
usual
letter-writing
,
*NL*
hand-washing
,
candle-snuffing
,
and
safe-locking
,
that
closed
the
*NL*
business
of
the
day
.
As
I
stood
idle
by
Mr.
Jaggers
's
fire
,
its
rising
*NL*
and
falling
flame
made
the
two
casts
on
the
shelf
look
as
if
they
were
*NL*
playing
a
diabolical
game
at
bo-peep
with
me
;
while
the
pair
of
coarse
,
*NL*
fat
office
candles
that
dimly
lighted
Mr.
Jaggers
as
he
wrote
in
a
*NL*
corner
were
decorated
with
dirty
winding-sheets
,
as
if
in
remembrance
of
*NL*
a
host
of
hanged
clients
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
to
Gerrard
Street
,
all
three
together
,
in
a
hackney-coach
:
And
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
we
got
there
,
dinner
was
served
.
Although
I
should
not
have
*NL*
thought
of
making
,
in
that
place
,
the
most
distant
reference
by
so
much
*NL*
as
a
look
to
Wemmick
's
Walworth
sentiments
,
yet
I
should
have
had
no
*NL*
objection
to
catching
his
eye
now
and
then
in
a
friendly
way
.
But
it
*NL*
was
not
to
be
done
.
He
turned
his
eyes
on
Mr.
Jaggers
whenever
he
raised
*NL*
them
from
the
table
,
and
was
as
dry
and
distant
to
me
as
if
there
were
*NL*
twin
Wemmicks
,
and
this
was
the
wrong
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
send
that
note
of
Miss
Havisham
's
to
Mr.
Pip
,
Wemmick
?
''
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
asked
,
soon
after
we
began
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
returned
Wemmick
;
``
it
was
going
by
post
,
when
you
brought
Mr.
*NL*
Pip
into
the
office
.
Here
it
is
.
''
He
handed
it
to
his
principal
instead
*NL*
of
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
note
of
two
lines
,
Pip
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
handing
it
on
,
``
sent
*NL*
up
to
me
by
Miss
Havisham
on
account
of
her
not
being
sure
of
your
*NL*
address
.
She
tells
me
that
she
wants
to
see
you
on
a
little
matter
of
*NL*
business
you
mentioned
to
her
.
You
'll
go
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I
,
casting
my
eyes
over
the
note
,
which
was
exactly
in
those
*NL*
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
think
of
going
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
an
impending
engagement
,
''
said
I
,
glancing
at
Wemmick
,
who
was
*NL*
putting
fish
into
the
post-office
,
``
that
renders
me
rather
uncertain
of
*NL*
my
time
.
At
once
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Mr.
Pip
has
the
intention
of
going
at
once
,
''
said
Wemmick
to
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
,
``
he
need
n't
write
an
answer
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Receiving
this
as
an
intimation
that
it
was
best
not
to
delay
,
I
settled
*NL*
that
I
would
go
to-morrow
,
and
said
so
.
Wemmick
drank
a
glass
of
wine
,
*NL*
and
looked
with
a
grimly
satisfied
air
at
Mr.
Jaggers
,
but
not
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
Pip
!
Our
friend
the
Spider
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
has
played
his
*NL*
cards
.
He
has
won
the
pool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
much
as
I
could
do
to
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hah
!
He
is
a
promising
fellow
--
in
his
way
--
but
he
may
not
have
it
all
*NL*
his
own
way
.
The
stronger
will
win
in
the
end
,
but
the
stronger
has
to
*NL*
be
found
out
first
.
If
he
should
turn
to
,
and
beat
her
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
''
I
interrupted
,
with
a
burning
face
and
heart
,
``
you
do
not
*NL*
seriously
think
that
he
is
scoundrel
enough
for
that
,
Mr.
Jaggers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
so
,
Pip
.
I
am
putting
a
case
.
If
he
should
turn
to
and
*NL*
beat
her
,
he
may
possibly
get
the
strength
on
his
side
;
if
it
should
be
*NL*
a
question
of
intellect
,
he
certainly
will
not
.
It
would
be
chance
*NL*
work
to
give
an
opinion
how
a
fellow
of
that
sort
will
turn
out
in
such
*NL*
circumstances
,
because
it
's
a
toss-up
between
two
results
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
what
they
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fellow
like
our
friend
the
Spider
,
''
answered
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
either
*NL*
beats
or
cringes
.
He
may
cringe
and
growl
,
or
cringe
and
not
growl
;
but
*NL*
he
either
beats
or
cringes
.
Ask
Wemmick
his
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Either
beats
or
cringes
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
not
at
all
addressing
himself
*NL*
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
here
's
to
Mrs.
Bentley
Drummle
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
taking
a
decanter
*NL*
of
choicer
wine
from
his
dumb-waiter
,
and
filling
for
each
of
us
and
*NL*
for
himself
,
``
and
may
the
question
of
supremacy
be
settled
to
the
lady
's
*NL*
satisfaction
!
To
the
satisfaction
of
the
lady
and
the
gentleman
,
*NL*
it
never
will
be
.
Now
,
Molly
,
Molly
,
Molly
,
Molly
,
how
slow
you
are
*NL*
to-day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
at
his
elbow
when
he
addressed
her
,
putting
a
dish
upon
the
*NL*
table
.
As
she
withdrew
her
hands
from
it
,
she
fell
back
a
step
or
two
,
*NL*
nervously
muttering
some
excuse
.
And
a
certain
action
of
her
fingers
,
as
*NL*
she
spoke
,
arrested
my
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
Only
the
subject
we
were
speaking
of
,
''
said
I
,
``
was
rather
*NL*
painful
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
action
of
her
fingers
was
like
the
action
of
knitting
.
She
stood
*NL*
looking
at
her
master
,
not
understanding
whether
she
was
free
to
go
,
or
*NL*
whether
he
had
more
to
say
to
her
and
would
call
her
back
if
she
did
go
.
*NL*
Her
look
was
very
intent
.
Surely
,
I
had
seen
exactly
such
eyes
and
such
*NL*
hands
on
a
memorable
occasion
very
lately
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
dismissed
her
,
and
she
glided
out
of
the
room
.
But
she
remained
*NL*
before
me
as
plainly
as
if
she
were
still
there
.
I
looked
at
those
*NL*
hands
,
I
looked
at
those
eyes
,
I
looked
at
that
flowing
hair
;
and
I
*NL*
compared
them
with
other
hands
,
other
eyes
,
other
hair
,
that
I
knew
of
,
*NL*
and
with
what
those
might
be
after
twenty
years
of
a
brutal
husband
*NL*
and
a
stormy
life
.
I
looked
again
at
those
hands
and
eyes
of
the
*NL*
housekeeper
,
and
thought
of
the
inexplicable
feeling
that
had
come
over
*NL*
me
when
I
last
walked
--
not
alone
--
in
the
ruined
garden
,
and
through
the
*NL*
deserted
brewery
.
I
thought
how
the
same
feeling
had
come
back
when
I
*NL*
saw
a
face
looking
at
me
,
and
a
hand
waving
to
me
from
a
stage-coach
*NL*
window
;
and
how
it
had
come
back
again
and
had
flashed
about
me
like
*NL*
lightning
,
when
I
had
passed
in
a
carriage
--
not
alone
--
through
a
sudden
*NL*
glare
of
light
in
a
dark
street
.
I
thought
how
one
link
of
association
*NL*
had
helped
that
identification
in
the
theatre
,
and
how
such
a
link
,
*NL*
wanting
before
,
had
been
riveted
for
me
now
,
when
I
had
passed
by
a
*NL*
chance
swift
from
Estella
's
name
to
the
fingers
with
their
knitting
*NL*
action
,
and
the
attentive
eyes
.
And
I
felt
absolutely
certain
that
this
*NL*
woman
was
Estella
's
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
had
seen
me
with
Estella
,
and
was
not
likely
to
have
missed
*NL*
the
sentiments
I
had
been
at
no
pains
to
conceal
.
He
nodded
when
I
said
*NL*
the
subject
was
painful
to
me
,
clapped
me
on
the
back
,
put
round
the
*NL*
wine
again
,
and
went
on
with
his
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
twice
more
did
the
housekeeper
reappear
,
and
then
her
stay
in
the
*NL*
room
was
very
short
,
and
Mr.
Jaggers
was
sharp
with
her
.
But
her
hands
*NL*
were
Estella
's
hands
,
and
her
eyes
were
Estella
's
eyes
,
and
if
she
had
*NL*
reappeared
a
hundred
times
I
could
have
been
neither
more
sure
nor
less
*NL*
sure
that
my
conviction
was
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
dull
evening
,
for
Wemmick
drew
his
wine
,
when
it
came
round
,
*NL*
quite
as
a
matter
of
business
,
--
just
as
he
might
have
drawn
his
salary
*NL*
when
that
came
round
,
--
and
with
his
eyes
on
his
chief
,
sat
in
a
state
of
*NL*
perpetual
readiness
for
cross-examination
.
As
to
the
quantity
of
wine
,
*NL*
his
post-office
was
as
indifferent
and
ready
as
any
other
post-office
*NL*
for
its
quantity
of
letters
.
From
my
point
of
view
,
he
was
the
wrong
*NL*
twin
all
the
time
,
and
only
externally
like
the
Wemmick
of
Walworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
took
our
leave
early
,
and
left
together
.
Even
when
we
were
groping
*NL*
among
Mr.
Jaggers
's
stock
of
boots
for
our
hats
,
I
felt
that
the
right
*NL*
twin
was
on
his
way
back
;
and
we
had
not
gone
half
a
dozen
yards
down
*NL*
Gerrard
Street
in
the
Walworth
direction
,
before
I
found
that
I
was
*NL*
walking
arm
in
arm
with
the
right
twin
,
and
that
the
wrong
twin
had
*NL*
evaporated
into
the
evening
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
that
's
over
!
He
's
a
wonderful
man
,
without
his
*NL*
living
likeness
;
but
I
feel
that
I
have
to
screw
myself
up
when
I
dine
*NL*
with
him
,
--
and
I
dine
more
comfortably
unscrewed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
that
this
was
a
good
statement
of
the
case
,
and
told
him
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
say
it
to
anybody
but
yourself
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
know
that
*NL*
what
is
said
between
you
and
me
goes
no
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
seen
Miss
Havisham
's
adopted
daughter
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Bentley
Drummle
.
He
said
no
.
To
avoid
being
too
abrupt
,
I
then
spoke
*NL*
of
the
Aged
and
of
Miss
Skiffins
.
He
looked
rather
sly
when
I
mentioned
*NL*
Miss
Skiffins
,
and
stopped
in
the
street
to
blow
his
nose
,
with
a
roll
*NL*
of
the
head
,
and
a
flourish
not
quite
free
from
latent
boastfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wemmick
,
''
said
I
,
``
do
you
remember
telling
me
,
before
I
first
went
to
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
's
private
house

that
housekeeper
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
?
''
he
replied
.
``
Ah
,
I
dare
say
I
did

Deuce

me

he
added
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
``
I
know
I
did

I
find
I
am
not
quite
unscrewed
yet

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

Wemmick
replied
,
``

I
do

Of

``
A
score
or
so
of
years
ago
,
that
woman
was
tried
at
the
Old
Bailey
for
*NL*
murder
,
and
was
acquitted
.
She
was
a
very
handsome
young
woman
,
and
I
*NL*
believe
had
some
gypsy
blood
in
her
.
Anyhow
,
it
was
hot
enough
when
it
*NL*
was
up
,
as
you
may
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
was
acquitted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jaggers
was
for
her
,
''
pursued
Wemmick
,
with
a
look
full
of
meaning
,
*NL*
``
and
worked
the
case
in
a
way
quite
astonishing
.
It
was
a
desperate
*NL*
case
,
and
it
was
comparatively
early
days
with
him
then
,
and
he
worked
*NL*
it
to
general
admiration
;
in
fact
,
it
may
almost
be
said
to
have
made
*NL*
him
.
He
worked
it
himself
at
the
police-office
,
day
after
day
for
many
*NL*
days
,
contending
against
even
a
committal
;
and
at
the
trial
where
he
*NL*
could
n't
work
it
himself
,
sat
under
counsel
,
and
--
every
one
knew
--
put
*NL*
in
all
the
salt
and
pepper
.
The
murdered
person
was
a
woman
,
--
a
woman
a
*NL*
good
ten
years
older
,
very
much
larger
,
and
very
much
stronger
.
It
was
*NL*
a
case
of
jealousy
.
They
both
led
tramping
lives
,
and
this
woman
in
*NL*
Gerrard
Street
here
had
been
married
very
young
,
over
the
broomstick
-LRB-
as
*NL*
we
say
-RRB-
,
to
a
tramping
man
,
and
was
a
perfect
fury
in
point
of
jealousy
.
*NL*
The
murdered
woman
,
--
more
a
match
for
the
man
,
certainly
,
in
point
of
*NL*
years
--
was
found
dead
in
a
barn
near
Hounslow
Heath
.
There
had
been
a
*NL*
violent
struggle
,
perhaps
a
fight
.
She
was
bruised
and
scratched
and
*NL*
torn
,
and
had
been
held
by
the
throat
,
at
last
,
and
choked
.
Now
,
there
*NL*
was
no
reasonable
evidence
to
implicate
any
person
but
this
woman
,
and
*NL*
on
the
improbabilities
of
her
having
been
able
to
do
it
Mr.
Jaggers
*NL*
principally
rested
his
case
.
You
may
be
sure
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
touching
me
*NL*
on
the
sleeve
,
``
that
he
never
dwelt
upon
the
strength
of
her
hands
then
,
*NL*
though
he
sometimes
does
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
told
Wemmick
of
his
showing
us
her
wrists
,
that
day
of
the
dinner
*NL*
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
!
''
Wemmick
went
on
;
``
it
happened
--
happened
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
see
?
--
that
this
woman
was
so
very
artfully
dressed
from
the
time
of
*NL*
her
apprehension
,
that
she
looked
much
slighter
than
she
really
was
;
in
*NL*
particular
,
her
sleeves
are
always
remembered
to
have
been
so
skilfully
*NL*
contrived
that
her
arms
had
quite
a
delicate
look
.
She
had
only
a
bruise
*NL*
or
two
about
her
,
--
nothing
for
a
tramp
,
--
but
the
backs
of
her
hands
*NL*
were
lacerated
,
and
the
question
was
,
Was
it
with
finger-nails
?
Now
,
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
showed
that
she
had
struggled
through
a
great
lot
of
brambles
*NL*
which
were
not
as
high
as
her
face
;
but
which
she
could
not
have
got
*NL*
through
and
kept
her
hands
out
of
;
and
bits
of
those
brambles
were
*NL*
actually
found
in
her
skin
and
put
in
evidence
,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
*NL*
the
brambles
in
question
were
found
on
examination
to
have
been
broken
*NL*
through
,
and
to
have
little
shreds
of
her
dress
and
little
spots
of
*NL*
blood
upon
them
here
and
there
.
But
the
boldest
point
he
made
was
this
:
*NL*
it
was
attempted
to
be
set
up
,
in
proof
of
her
jealousy
,
that
she
was
*NL*
under
strong
suspicion
of
having
,
at
about
the
time
of
the
murder
,
*NL*
frantically
destroyed
her
child
by
this
man
--
some
three
years
old
--
to
*NL*
revenge
herself
upon
him
.
Mr.
Jaggers
worked
that
in
this
way
:
``
We
say
*NL*
these
are
not
marks
of
finger-nails
,
but
marks
of
brambles
,
and
we
show
*NL*
you
the
brambles
.
You
say
they
are
marks
of
finger-nails
,
and
you
set
*NL*
up
the
hypothesis
that
she
destroyed
her
child
.
You
must
accept
all
*NL*
consequences
of
that
hypothesis
.
For
anything
we
know
,
she
may
have
*NL*
destroyed
her
child
,
and
the
child
in
clinging
to
her
may
have
scratched
*NL*
her
hands
.
What
then
?
You
are
not
trying
her
for
the
murder
of
her
*NL*
child
;
why
do
n't
you
?
As
to
this
case
,
if
you
will
have
scratches
,
*NL*
we
say
that
,
for
anything
we
know
,
you
may
have
accounted
for
them
,
*NL*
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
you
have
not
invented
them
?
''
``
To
*NL*
sum
up
,
sir
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
Mr.
Jaggers
was
altogether
too
many
for
the
*NL*
jury
,
and
they
gave
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
been
in
his
service
ever
since
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
not
only
that
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
she
went
into
his
service
*NL*
immediately
after
her
acquittal
,
tamed
as
she
is
now
.
She
has
since
been
*NL*
taught
one
thing
and
another
in
the
way
of
her
duties
,
but
she
was
tamed
*NL*
from
the
beginning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
the
sex
of
the
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Said
to
have
been
a
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
me
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
I
got
your
letter
and
destroyed
it
.
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
exchanged
a
cordial
good-night
,
and
I
went
home
,
with
new
matter
for
*NL*
my
thoughts
,
though
with
no
relief
from
the
old

Chapter
XLIX
*NL*
*NL*
Putting
Miss
Havisham
's
note
in
my
pocket
,
that
it
might
serve
as
*NL*
my
credentials
for
so
soon
reappearing
at
Satis
House
,
in
case
her
*NL*
waywardness
should
lead
her
to
express
any
surprise
at
seeing
me
,
I
went
*NL*
down
again
by
the
coach
next
day
.
But
I
alighted
at
the
Halfway
House
,
*NL*
and
breakfasted
there
,
and
walked
the
rest
of
the
distance
;
for
I
sought
*NL*
to
get
into
the
town
quietly
by
the
unfrequented
ways
,
and
to
leave
it
*NL*
in
the
same
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
best
light
of
the
day
was
gone
when
I
passed
along
the
quiet
echoing
*NL*
courts
behind
the
High
Street
.
The
nooks
of
ruin
where
the
old
monks
had
*NL*
once
had
their
refectories
and
gardens
,
and
where
the
strong
walls
were
*NL*
now
pressed
into
the
service
of
humble
sheds
and
stables
,
were
almost
*NL*
as
silent
as
the
old
monks
in
their
graves
.
The
cathedral
chimes
had
at
*NL*
once
a
sadder
and
a
more
remote
sound
to
me
,
as
I
hurried
on
avoiding
*NL*
observation
,
than
they
had
ever
had
before
;
so
,
the
swell
of
the
old
*NL*
organ
was
borne
to
my
ears
like
funeral
music
;
and
the
rooks
,
as
they
*NL*
hovered
about
the
gray
tower
and
swung
in
the
bare
high
trees
of
the
*NL*
priory
garden
,
seemed
to
call
to
me
that
the
place
was
changed
,
and
that
*NL*
Estella
was
gone
out
of
it
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
elderly
woman
,
whom
I
had
seen
before
as
one
of
the
servants
who
*NL*
lived
in
the
supplementary
house
across
the
back
courtyard
,
opened
the
*NL*
gate
.
The
lighted
candle
stood
in
the
dark
passage
within
,
as
of
old
,
*NL*
and
I
took
it
up
and
ascended
the
staircase
alone
.
Miss
Havisham
was
not
*NL*
in
her
own
room
,
but
was
in
the
larger
room
across
the
landing
.
Looking
*NL*
in
at
the
door
,
after
knocking
in
vain
,
I
saw
her
sitting
on
the
hearth
*NL*
in
a
ragged
chair
,
close
before
,
and
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
,
the
*NL*
ashy
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doing
as
I
had
often
done
,
I
went
in
,
and
stood
touching
the
old
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
where
she
could
see
me
when
she
raised
her
eyes
.
There
*NL*
was
an
air
of
utter
loneliness
upon
her
,
that
would
have
moved
me
to
*NL*
pity
though
she
had
wilfully
done
me
a
deeper
injury
than
I
could
charge
*NL*
her
with
.
As
I
stood
compassionating
her
,
and
thinking
how
,
in
the
*NL*
progress
of
time
,
I
too
had
come
to
be
a
part
of
the
wrecked
fortunes
of
*NL*
that
house
,
her
eyes
rested
on
me
.
She
stared
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
,
*NL*
``
Is
it
real
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
,
Pip
.
Mr.
Jaggers
gave
me
your
note
yesterday
,
and
I
have
lost
*NL*
no
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
Thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
brought
another
of
the
ragged
chairs
to
the
hearth
and
sat
down
,
I
*NL*
remarked
a
new
expression
on
her
face
,
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
pursue
that
subject
you
mentioned
to
me
when
you
*NL*
were
last
here
,
and
to
show
you
that
I
am
not
all
stone
.
But
perhaps
you
*NL*
can
never
believe
,
now
,
that
there
is
anything
human
in
my
heart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
said
some
reassuring
words
,
she
stretched
out
her
tremulous
right
*NL*
hand
,
as
though
she
was
going
to
touch
me
;
but
she
recalled
it
again
*NL*
before
I
understood
the
action
,
or
knew
how
to
receive
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
,
speaking
for
your
friend
,
that
you
could
tell
me
how
to
do
*NL*
something
useful
and
good
.
Something
that
you
would
like
done
,
is
it
*NL*
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
that
I
would
like
done
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
explaining
to
her
that
secret
history
of
the
partnership
.
I
had
*NL*
not
got
far
into
it
,
when
I
judged
from
her
looks
that
she
was
thinking
*NL*
in
a
discursive
way
of
me
,
rather
than
of
what
I
said
.
It
seemed
to
be
*NL*
so
;
for
,
when
I
stopped
speaking
,
many
moments
passed
before
she
showed
*NL*
that
she
was
conscious
of
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
break
off
,
''
she
asked
then
,
with
her
former
air
of
being
afraid
*NL*
of
me
,
``
because
you
hate
me
too
much
to
bear
to
speak
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
I
answered
,
``
how
can
you
think
so
,
Miss
Havisham
!
I
stopped
*NL*
because
I
thought
you
were
not
following
what
I
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
was
not
,
''
she
answered
,
putting
a
hand
to
her
head
.
``
Begin
*NL*
again
,
and
let
me
look
at
something
else
.
Stay
!
Now
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
her
hand
upon
her
stick
in
the
resolute
way
that
sometimes
was
*NL*
habitual
to
her
,
and
looked
at
the
fire
with
a
strong
expression
of
*NL*
forcing
herself
to
attend
.
I
went
on
with
my
explanation
,
and
told
her
*NL*
how
I
had
hoped
to
complete
the
transaction
out
of
my
means
,
but
how
*NL*
in
this
I
was
disappointed
.
That
part
of
the
subject
-LRB-
I
reminded
her
-RRB-
*NL*
involved
matters
which
could
form
no
part
of
my
explanation
,
for
they
*NL*
were
the
weighty
secrets
of
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
!
''
said
she
,
assenting
with
her
head
,
but
not
looking
at
me
.
``
And
how
*NL*
much
money
is
wanting
to
complete
the
purchase
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
rather
afraid
of
stating
it
,
for
it
sounded
a
large
sum
.
``
Nine
*NL*
hundred
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
give
you
the
money
for
this
purpose
,
will
you
keep
my
secret
as
*NL*
you
have
kept
your
own
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
as
faithfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
mind
will
be
more
at
rest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
more
at
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
unhappy
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
this
question
,
still
without
looking
at
me
,
but
in
an
unwonted
*NL*
tone
of
sympathy
.
I
could
not
reply
at
the
moment
,
for
my
voice
failed
*NL*
me
.
She
put
her
left
arm
across
the
head
of
her
stick
,
and
softly
laid
*NL*
her
forehead
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
far
from
happy
,
Miss
Havisham
;
but
I
have
other
causes
of
disquiet
*NL*
than
any
you
know
of
.
They
are
the
secrets
I
have
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
while
,
she
raised
her
head
,
and
looked
at
the
fire
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
noble
in
you
to
tell
me
that
you
have
other
causes
of
*NL*
unhappiness
.
Is
it
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
only
serve
you
,
Pip
,
by
serving
your
friend
?
Regarding
that
as
*NL*
done
,
is
there
nothing
I
can
do
for
you
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
I
thank
you
for
the
question
.
I
thank
you
even
more
for
the
*NL*
tone
of
the
question
.
But
there
is
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
presently
rose
from
her
seat
,
and
looked
about
the
blighted
room
*NL*
for
the
means
of
writing
.
There
were
none
there
,
and
she
took
from
her
*NL*
pocket
a
yellow
set
of
ivory
tablets
,
mounted
in
tarnished
gold
,
and
*NL*
wrote
upon
them
with
a
pencil
in
a
case
of
tarnished
gold
that
hung
from
*NL*
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
still
on
friendly
terms
with
Mr.
Jaggers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
.
I
dined
with
him
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
an
authority
to
him
to
pay
you
that
money
,
to
lay
out
at
your
*NL*
irresponsible
discretion

your
friend
.
I
keep
no
money
here
;
but
if
*NL*
you
would
rather
Mr.
Jaggers
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
,
I
will
send
it
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Miss
Havisham
;
I
have
not
the
least
objection
to
receiving
*NL*
it
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
read
me
what
she
had
written
;
and
it
was
direct
and
clear
,
and
*NL*
evidently
intended
to
absolve
me
from
any
suspicion
of
profiting
by
the
*NL*
receipt
of
the
money
.
I
took
the
tablets
from
her
hand
,
and
it
trembled
*NL*
again
,
and
it
trembled
more
as
she
took
off
the
chain
to
which
the
*NL*
pencil
was
attached
,
and
put
it
in
mine
.
All
this
she
did
without
*NL*
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
on
the
first
leaf
.
If
you
can
ever
write
under
my
name
,
``
I
*NL*

her

''
though
ever
so
long
after
my
broken
heart
is
dust
pray
do
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Miss
Havisham
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
can
do
it
now
.
There
have
been
sore
*NL*
mistakes
;
and
my
life
has
been
a
blind
and
thankless
one
;
and
I
want
*NL*
forgiveness
and
direction
far
too
much
,
to
be
bitter
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
face
to
me
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
averted
it
,
*NL*
and
,
to
my
amazement
,
I
may
even
add
to
my
terror
,
dropped
on
her
knees
*NL*
at
my
feet
;
with
her
folded
hands
raised
to
me
in
the
manner
in
which
,
*NL*
when
her
poor
heart
was
young
and
fresh
and
whole
,
they
must
often
have
*NL*
been
raised
to
heaven
from
her
mother
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
see
her
with
her
white
hair
and
her
worn
face
kneeling
at
my
feet
*NL*
gave
me
a
shock
through
all
my
frame
.
I
entreated
her
to
rise
,
and
got
*NL*
my
arms
about
her
to
help
her
up
;
but
she
only
pressed
that
hand
of
mine
*NL*
which
was
nearest
to
her
grasp
,
and
hung
her
head
over
it
and
wept
.
I
*NL*
had
never
seen
her
shed
a
tear
before
,
and
,
in
the
hope
that
the
*NL*
relief
might
do
her
good
,
I
bent
over
her
without
speaking
.
She
was
not
*NL*
kneeling
now
,
but
was
down
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
''
she
cried
,
despairingly
.
``
What
have
I
done
!
What
have
I
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
,
Miss
Havisham
,
what
have
you
done
to
injure
me
,
let
me
*NL*
answer
.
Very
little
.
I
should
have
loved
her
under
any
circumstances
.
Is
*NL*
she
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
needless
question
,
for
a
new
desolation
in
the
desolate
house
*NL*
had
told
me
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
done
!
What
have
I
done
!
''
She
wrung
her
hands
,
and
crushed
*NL*
her
white
hair
,
and
returned
to
this
cry
over
and
over
again
.
``
What
have
*NL*
I
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
not
how
to
answer
,
or
how
to
comfort
her
.
That
she
had
done
a
*NL*
grievous
thing
in
taking
an
impressionable
child
to
mould
into
the
form
*NL*
that
her
wild
resentment
,
spurned
affection
,
and
wounded
pride
found
*NL*
vengeance
in
,
I
knew
full
well
.
But
that
,
in
shutting
out
the
light
*NL*
of
day
,
she
had
shut
out
infinitely
more
;
that
,
in
seclusion
,
she
had
*NL*
secluded
herself
from
a
thousand
natural
and
healing
influences
;
that
,
*NL*
her
mind
,
brooding
solitary
,
had
grown
diseased
,
as
all
minds
do
and
*NL*
must
and
will
that
reverse
the
appointed
order
of
their
Maker
,
I
knew
*NL*
equally
well
.
And
could
I
look
upon
her
without
compassion
,
seeing
her
*NL*
punishment
in
the
ruin
she
was
,
in
her
profound
unfitness
for
this
earth
*NL*
on
which
she
was
placed
,
in
the
vanity
of
sorrow
which
had
become
a
*NL*
master
mania
,
like
the
vanity
of
penitence
,
the
vanity
of
remorse
,
the
*NL*
vanity
of
unworthiness
,
and
other
monstrous
vanities
that
have
been
*NL*
curses
in
this
world
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Until
you
spoke
to
her
the
other
day
,
and
until
I
saw
in
you
a
*NL*
looking-glass
that
showed
me
what
I
once
felt
myself
,
I
did
not
know
*NL*
what
I
had
done
.
What
have
I
done
!
What
have
I
done
!
''
And
so
again
,
*NL*
twenty
,
fifty
times
over
,
What
had
she
done
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Havisham
,
''
I
said
,
when
her
cry
had
died
away
,
``
you
may
dismiss
me
*NL*
from
your
mind
and
conscience
.
But
Estella
is
a
different
case
,
and
if
*NL*
you
can
ever
undo
any
scrap
of
what
you
have
done
amiss
in
keeping
a
*NL*
part
of
her
right
nature
away
from
her
,
it
will
be
better
to
do
that
*NL*
than
to
bemoan
the
past
through
a
hundred
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
it
.
But
,
Pip
--
my
dear
!
''
There
was
an
earnest
womanly
*NL*
compassion
for
me
in
her
new
affection
.
``
My
dear
!
Believe
this
:
when
she
*NL*
first
came
to
me
,
I
meant
to
save
her
from
misery
like
my
own
.
At
first
,
*NL*
I
meant
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
I.
``
I
hope
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
she
grew
,
and
promised
to
be
very
beautiful
,
I
gradually
did
*NL*
worse
,
and
with
my
praises
,
and
with
my
jewels
,
and
with
my
teachings
,
*NL*
and
with
this
figure
of
myself
always
before
her
,
a
warning
to
back
and
*NL*
point
my
lessons
,
I
stole
her
heart
away
,
and
put
ice
in
its
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
,
''
I
could
not
help
saying
,
``
to
have
left
her
a
natural
heart
,
*NL*
even
to
be
bruised
or
broken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
Miss
Havisham
looked
distractedly
at
me
for
a
while
,
and
then
*NL*
burst
out
again
,
What
had
she
done
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
knew
all
my
story
,
''
she
pleaded
,
``
you
would
have
some
compassion
*NL*
for
me
and
a
better
understanding
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Havisham
,
''
I
answered
,
as
delicately
as
I
could
,
``
I
believe
I
may
*NL*
say
that
I
do
know
your
story
,
and
have
known
it
ever
since
I
first
left
*NL*
this
neighborhood
.
It
has
inspired
me
with
great
commiseration
,
and
I
*NL*
hope
I
understand
it
and
its
influences
.
Does
what
has
passed
between
us
*NL*
give
me
any
excuse
for
asking
you
a
question
relative
to
Estella
?
Not
as
*NL*
she
is
,
but
as
she
was
when
she
first
came
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
seated
on
the
ground
,
with
her
arms
on
the
ragged
chair
,
and
*NL*
her
head
leaning
on
them
.
She
looked
full
at
me
when
I
said
this
,
and
*NL*
replied
,
``
Go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
child
was
Estella
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mr.
Jaggers
brought
her
here
,
or
sent
her
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brought
her
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
tell
me
how
that
came
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
in
a
low
whisper
and
with
caution
:
``
I
had
been
shut
up
in
*NL*
these
rooms
a
long
time
-LRB-
I
do
n't
know
how
long
;
you
know
what
time
the
*NL*
clocks
keep
here
-RRB-
,
when
I
told
him
that
I
wanted
a
little
girl
to
rear
*NL*
and
love
,
and
save
from
my
fate
.
I
had
first
seen
him
when
I
sent
*NL*
for
him
to
lay
this
place
waste
for
me
;
having
read
of
him
in
the
*NL*
newspapers
,
before
I
and
the
world
parted
.
He
told
me
that
he
would
*NL*
look
about
him
for
such
an
orphan
child
.
One
night
he
brought
her
here
*NL*
asleep
,
and
I
called
her
Estella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
I
ask
her
age
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
or
three
.
She
herself
knows
nothing
,
but
that
she
was
left
an
*NL*
orphan
and
I
adopted
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
convinced
I
was
of
that
woman
's
being
her
mother
,
that
I
wanted
*NL*
no
evidence
to
establish
the
fact
in
my
own
mind
.
But
,
to
any
mind
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
the
connection
here
was
clear
and
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
more
could
I
hope
to
do
by
prolonging
the
interview
?
I
had
*NL*
succeeded
on
behalf
of
Herbert
,
Miss
Havisham
had
told
me
all
she
knew
*NL*
of
Estella
,
I
had
said
and
done
what
I
could
to
ease
her
mind
.
No
matter
*NL*
with
what
other
words
we
parted
;
we
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twilight
was
closing
in
when
I
went
downstairs
into
the
natural
air
.
I
*NL*
called
to
the
woman
who
had
opened
the
gate
when
I
entered
,
that
I
would
*NL*
not
trouble
her
just
yet
,
but
would
walk
round
the
place
before
leaving
.
*NL*
For
I
had
a
presentiment
that
I
should
never
be
there
again
,
and
I
felt
*NL*
that
the
dying
light
was
suited
to
my
last
view
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
wilderness
of
casks
that
I
had
walked
on
long
ago
,
and
on
which
*NL*
the
rain
of
years
had
fallen
since
,
rotting
them
in
many
places
,
and
*NL*
leaving
miniature
swamps
and
pools
of
water
upon
those
that
stood
on
*NL*
end
,
I
made
my
way
to
the
ruined
garden
.
I
went
all
round
it
;
round
by
*NL*
the
corner
where
Herbert
and
I
had
fought
our
battle
;
round
by
the
paths
*NL*
where
Estella
and
I
had
walked
.
So
cold
,
so
lonely
,
so
dreary
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
the
brewery
on
my
way
back
,
I
raised
the
rusty
latch
of
a
little
*NL*
door
at
the
garden
end
of
it
,
and
walked
through
.
I
was
going
out
at
the
*NL*
opposite
door
,
--
not
easy
to
open
now
,
for
the
damp
wood
had
started
and
*NL*
swelled
,
and
the
hinges
were
yielding
,
and
the
threshold
was
encumbered
*NL*
with
a
growth
of
fungus
,
--
when
I
turned
my
head
to
look
back
.
A
childish
*NL*
association
revived
with
wonderful
force
in
the
moment
of
the
slight
*NL*
action
,
and
I
fancied
that
I
saw
Miss
Havisham
hanging
to
the
beam
.
So
*NL*
strong
was
the
impression
,
that
I
stood
under
the
beam
shuddering
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
before
I
knew
it
was
a
fancy
,
--
though
to
be
sure
I
was
*NL*
there
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mournfulness
of
the
place
and
time
,
and
the
great
terror
of
*NL*
this
illusion
,
though
it
was
but
momentary
,
caused
me
to
feel
an
*NL*
indescribable
awe
as
I
came
out
between
the
open
wooden
gates
where
I
*NL*
had
once
wrung
my
hair
after
Estella
had
wrung
my
heart
.
Passing
on
into
*NL*
the
front
courtyard
,
I
hesitated
whether
to
call
the
woman
to
let
me
out
*NL*
at
the
locked
gate
of
which
she
had
the
key
,
or
first
to
go
upstairs
*NL*
and
assure
myself
that
Miss
Havisham
was
as
safe
and
well
as
I
had
left
*NL*
her
.
I
took
the
latter
course
and
went
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
into
the
room
where
I
had
left
her
,
and
I
saw
her
seated
in
the
*NL*
ragged
chair
upon
the
hearth
close
to
the
fire
,
with
her
back
towards
*NL*
me
.
In
the
moment
when
I
was
withdrawing
my
head
to
go
quietly
away
,
*NL*
I
saw
a
great
flaming
light
spring
up
.
In
the
same
moment
I
saw
her
*NL*
running
at
me
,
shrieking
,
with
a
whirl
of
fire
blazing
all
about
her
,
*NL*
and
soaring
at
least
as
many
feet
above
her
head
as
she
was
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
double-caped
great-coat
on
,
and
over
my
arm
another
thick
coat
.
*NL*
That
I
got
them
off
,
closed
with
her
,
threw
her
down
,
and
got
them
over
*NL*
her
;
that
I
dragged
the
great
cloth
from
the
table
for
the
same
purpose
,
*NL*
and
with
it
dragged
down
the
heap
of
rottenness
in
the
midst
,
and
*NL*
all
the
ugly
things
that
sheltered
there
;
that
we
were
on
the
ground
*NL*
struggling
like
desperate
enemies
,
and
that
the
closer
I
covered
her
,
*NL*
the
more
wildly
she
shrieked
and
tried
to
free
herself
,
--
that
this
*NL*
occurred
I
knew
through
the
result
,
but
not
through
anything
I
felt
,
or
*NL*
thought
,
or
knew
I
did
.
I
knew
nothing
until
I
knew
that
we
were
on
the
*NL*
floor
by
the
great
table
,
and
that
patches
of
tinder
yet
alight
were
*NL*
floating
in
the
smoky
air
,
which
,
a
moment
ago
,
had
been
her
faded
*NL*
bridal
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
I
looked
round
and
saw
the
disturbed
beetles
and
spiders
running
*NL*
away
over
the
floor
,
and
the
servants
coming
in
with
breathless
cries
*NL*
at
the
door
.
I
still
held
her
forcibly
down
with
all
my
strength
,
like
*NL*
a
prisoner
who
might
escape
;
and
I
doubt
if
I
even
knew
who
she
was
,
or
*NL*
why
we
had
struggled
,
or
that
she
had
been
in
flames
,
or
that
the
flames
*NL*
were
out
,
until
I
saw
the
patches
of
tinder
that
had
been
her
garments
*NL*
no
longer
alight
but
falling
in
a
black
shower
around
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
insensible
,
and
I
was
afraid
to
have
her
moved
,
or
even
*NL*
touched
.
Assistance
was
sent
for
,
and
I
held
her
until
it
came
,
as
if
*NL*
I
unreasonably
fancied
-LRB-
I
think
I
did
-RRB-
that
,
if
I
let
her
go
,
the
fire
*NL*
would
break
out
again
and
consume
her
.
When
I
got
up
,
on
the
surgeon
's
*NL*
coming
to
her
with
other
aid
,
I
was
astonished
to
see
that
both
my
hands
*NL*
were
burnt
;
for
,
I
had
no
knowledge
of
it
through
the
sense
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
examination
it
was
pronounced
that
she
had
received
serious
hurts
,
*NL*
but
that
they
of
themselves
were
far
from
hopeless
;
the
danger
lay
*NL*
mainly
in
the
nervous
shock
.
By
the
surgeon
's
directions
,
her
bed
was
*NL*
carried
into
that
room
and
laid
upon
the
great
table
,
which
happened
to
*NL*
be
well
suited
to
the
dressing
of
her
injuries
.
When
I
saw
her
again
,
an
*NL*
hour
afterwards
,
she
lay
,
indeed
,
where
I
had
seen
her
strike
her
stick
,
*NL*
and
had
heard
her
say
that
she
would
lie
one
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
every
vestige
of
her
dress
was
burnt
,
as
they
told
me
,
she
*NL*
still
had
something
of
her
old
ghastly
bridal
appearance
;
for
,
they
had
*NL*
covered
her
to
the
throat
with
white
cotton-wool
,
and
as
she
lay
with
*NL*
a
white
sheet
loosely
overlying
that
,
the
phantom
air
of
something
that
*NL*
had
been
and
was
changed
was
still
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
,
on
questioning
the
servants
,
that
Estella
was
in
Paris
,
and
I
*NL*
got
a
promise
from
the
surgeon
that
he
would
write
to
her
by
the
*NL*
next
post
.
Miss
Havisham
's
family
I
took
upon
myself
;
intending
to
*NL*
communicate
with
Mr.
Matthew
Pocket
only
,
and
leave
him
to
do
as
he
*NL*
liked
about
informing
the
rest
.
This
I
did
next
day
,
through
Herbert
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
returned
to
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stage
,
that
evening
,
when
she
spoke
collectedly
of
what
had
*NL*
happened
,
though
with
a
certain
terrible
vivacity
.
Towards
midnight
she
*NL*
began
to
wander
in
her
speech
;
and
after
that
it
gradually
set
in
that
*NL*
she
said
innumerable
times
in
a
low
solemn
voice
,
``
What
have
I
done
!
''
*NL*
And
then
,
``
When
she
first
came
,
I
meant
to
save
her
from
misery
like
*NL*
mine
.
''
And
then
,
``
Take
the
pencil
and
write
under
my
name
,
'
I
forgive
*NL*
her
!
'
''
She
never
changed
the
order
of
these
three
sentences
,
but
she
*NL*
sometimes
left
out
a
word
in
one
or
other
of
them
;
never
putting
in
*NL*
another
word
,
but
always
leaving
a
blank
and
going
on
to
the
next
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
could
do
no
service
there
,
and
as
I
had
,
nearer
home
,
that
pressing
*NL*
reason
for
anxiety
and
fear
which
even
her
wanderings
could
not
drive
*NL*
out
of
my
mind
,
I
decided
,
in
the
course
of
the
night
that
I
would
*NL*
return
by
the
early
morning
coach
,
walking
on
a
mile
or
so
,
and
being
*NL*
taken
up
clear
of
the
town
.
At
about
six
o'clock
of
the
morning
,
*NL*
therefore
,
I
leaned
over
her
and
touched
her
lips
with
mine
,
just
as
*NL*
they
said
,
not
stopping
for
being
touched
,
``
Take
the
pencil
and
write
*NL*
under
my
name
,
'
I
forgive
her
.

Chapter
L
*NL*
*NL*
My
hands
had
been
dressed
twice
or
thrice
in
the
night
,
and
again
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
My
left
arm
was
a
good
deal
burned
to
the
elbow
,
and
,
less
*NL*
severely
,
as
high
as
the
shoulder
;
it
was
very
painful
,
but
the
flames
*NL*
had
set
in
that
direction
,
and
I
felt
thankful
it
was
no
worse
.
My
right
*NL*
hand
was
not
so
badly
burnt
but
that
I
could
move
the
fingers
.
It
was
*NL*
bandaged
,
of
course
,
but
much
less
inconveniently
than
my
left
hand
and
*NL*
arm
;
those
I
carried
in
a
sling
;
and
I
could
only
wear
my
coat
like
a
*NL*
cloak
,
loose
over
my
shoulders
and
fastened
at
the
neck
.
My
hair
had
*NL*
been
caught
by
the
fire
,
but
not
my
head
or
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Herbert
had
been
down
to
Hammersmith
and
seen
his
father
,
he
came
*NL*
back
to
me
at
our
chambers
,
and
devoted
the
day
to
attending
on
me
.
He
*NL*
was
the
kindest
of
nurses
,
and
at
stated
times
took
off
the
bandages
,
*NL*
and
steeped
them
in
the
cooling
liquid
that
was
kept
ready
,
and
put
them
*NL*
on
again
,
with
a
patient
tenderness
that
I
was
deeply
grateful
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
as
I
lay
quiet
on
the
sofa
,
I
found
it
painfully
difficult
,
I
*NL*
might
say
impossible
,
to
get
rid
of
the
impression
of
the
glare
of
the
*NL*
flames
,
their
hurry
and
noise
,
and
the
fierce
burning
smell
.
If
I
*NL*
dozed
for
a
minute
,
I
was
awakened
by
Miss
Havisham
's
cries
,
and
by
her
*NL*
running
at
me
with
all
that
height
of
fire
above
her
head
.
This
pain
*NL*
of
the
mind
was
much
harder
to
strive
against
than
any
bodily
pain
I
*NL*
suffered
;
and
Herbert
,
seeing
that
,
did
his
utmost
to
hold
my
attention
*NL*
engaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
of
us
spoke
of
the
boat
,
but
we
both
thought
of
it
.
That
*NL*
was
made
apparent
by
our
avoidance
of
the
subject
,
and
by
our
*NL*
agreeing
--
without
agreement
--
to
make
my
recovery
of
the
use
of
my
hands
*NL*
a
question
of
so
many
hours
,
not
of
so
many
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
question
when
I
saw
Herbert
had
been
of
course
,
whether
all
*NL*
was
well
down
the
river
?
As
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
with
perfect
*NL*
confidence
and
cheerfulness
,
we
did
not
resume
the
subject
until
the
day
*NL*
was
wearing
away
.
But
then
,
as
Herbert
changed
the
bandages
,
more
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
fire
than
by
the
outer
light
,
he
went
back
to
it
*NL*
spontaneously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sat
with
Provis
last
night
,
Handel
,
two
good
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
was
Clara
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
little
thing
!
''
said
Herbert
.
``
She
was
up
and
down
with
*NL*
Gruffandgrim
all
the
evening
.
He
was
perpetually
pegging
at
the
floor
*NL*
the
moment
she
left
his
sight
.
I
doubt
if
he
can
hold
out
long
,
though
.
*NL*
What
with
rum
and
pepper
,
--
and
pepper
and
rum
,
--
I
should
think
his
*NL*
pegging
must
be
nearly
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
you
will
be
married
,
Herbert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
take
care
of
the
dear
child

Lay
your
arm
out
upon
*NL*
the
back
of
the
sofa
,
my
dear
boy
,
and
I
'll
sit
down
here
,
and
get
the
*NL*
bandage
off
so
gradually
that
you
shall
not
know
when
it
comes
.
I
was
*NL*
speaking
of
Provis
.
Do
you
know

he
improves
?

said
to

softened

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
did

And
so
he
is

He
was
very
communicative
last
night

told
me
more
of
his
life

You
remember
his
breaking
off
here
about
some
*NL*
woman
that
he
had
had
great
trouble
with
.

Did
I
hurt
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
I
had
started
,
but
not
under
his
touch
.
His
words
had
given
me
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
forgotten
that
,
Herbert
,
but
I
remember
it
now

speak
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

went
into
that
part
of
his
life

a
dark
wild

now

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
Herbert
bent
forward
to
look
at
me
more
nearly
,
as
if
my
reply
had
been
*NL*
rather
more
hurried
or
more
eager
than
he
could
quite
account
for
.
``
Your

he
said
,
touching
it

I.

now
there
remains
but
the
right
*NL*
hand
,
which
is
a
far
easier
job
.
I
can
do
it
better
by
this
light
*NL*
than
by
a
stronger
,
for
my
hand
is
steadiest
when
I
do
n't
see
the
poor
*NL*
blistered
patches
too
distinctly
.
--
You
do
n't
think
your
breathing
is
*NL*
affected
,
my
dear
boy
?
You
seem
to
breathe
quickly
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
do

Herbert

Did
the
woman
keep
her
oath
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
comes
the
darkest
part

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

returned
Herbert
,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
,
*NL*
and
again
bending
forward
to
get
a
nearer
look
at
me
.
``
He
says
it
all

I
*NL*
have
no
other
information

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

to
be
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
whether

''
pursued
Herbert
,
``
he
had
used
the
child
's
mother
ill
,
or
*NL*
whether
he
had
used
the
child
's
mother
well
,
Provis
does
n't
say
;
but
she
*NL*
had
shared
some
four
or
five
years
of
the
wretched
life
he
described
*NL*
to
us
at
this
fireside
,
and
he
seems
to
have
felt
pity
for
her
,
and
*NL*
forbearance
towards
her
.
Therefore
,
fearing
he
should
be
called
upon
to
*NL*
depose
about
this
destroyed
child
,
and
so
be
the
cause
of
her
death
,
he
*NL*
hid
himself
-LRB-
much
as
he
grieved
for
the
child
-RRB-
,
kept
himself
dark
,
as
he
*NL*
says
,
out
of
the
way
and
out
of
the
trial
,
and
was
only
vaguely
talked
*NL*
of
as
a
certain
man
called
Abel
,
out
of
whom
the
jealousy
arose
.
After
*NL*
the
acquittal
she
disappeared
,
and
thus
he
lost
the
child

the
*NL*
child
's
mother

in

Chapter
LI
*NL*
*NL*
What
purpose
I
had
in
view
when
I
was
hot
on
tracing
out
and
proving
*NL*
Estella
's
parentage
,
I
can
not
say
.
It
will
presently
be
seen
that
the
*NL*
question
was
not
before
me
in
a
distinct
shape
until
it
was
put
before
*NL*
me
by
a
wiser
head
than
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Herbert
and
I
had
held
our
momentous
conversation
,
I
was
seized
*NL*
with
a
feverish
conviction
that
I
ought
to
hunt
the
matter
down
,
--
that
I
*NL*
ought
not
to
let
it
rest
,
but
that
I
ought
to
see
Mr.
Jaggers
,
and
come
*NL*
at
the
bare
truth
.
I
really
do
not
know
whether
I
felt
that
I
did
this
*NL*
for
Estella
's
sake
,
or
whether
I
was
glad
to
transfer
to
the
man
in
*NL*
whose
preservation
I
was
so
much
concerned
some
rays
of
the
romantic
*NL*
interest
that
had
so
long
surrounded
me
.
Perhaps
the
latter
possibility
*NL*
may
be
the
nearer
to
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
way
,
I
could
scarcely
be
withheld
from
going
out
to
Gerrard
Street
*NL*
that
night
.
Herbert
's
representations
that
,
if
I
did
,
I
should
probably
*NL*
be
laid
up
and
stricken
useless
,
when
our
fugitive
's
safety
would
depend
*NL*
upon
me
,
alone
restrained
my
impatience
.
On
the
understanding
,
again
*NL*
and
again
reiterated
,
that
,
come
what
would
,
I
was
to
go
to
Mr.
Jaggers
*NL*
to-morrow
,
I
at
length
submitted
to
keep
quiet
,
and
to
have
my
hurts
*NL*
looked
after
,
and
to
stay
at
home
.
Early
next
morning
we
went
out
*NL*
together
,
and
at
the
corner
of
Giltspur
Street
by
Smithfield
,
I
left
*NL*
Herbert
to
go
his
way
into
the
City
,
and
took
my
way
to
Little
Britain
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
periodical
occasions
when
Mr.
Jaggers
and
Wemmick
went
over
*NL*
the
office
accounts
,
and
checked
off
the
vouchers
,
and
put
all
things
*NL*
straight
.
On
these
occasions
,
Wemmick
took
his
books
and
papers
into
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
's
room
,
and
one
of
the
upstairs
clerks
came
down
into
the
outer
*NL*
office
.
Finding
such
clerk
on
Wemmick
's
post
that
morning
,
I
knew
*NL*
what
was
going
on
;
but
I
was
not
sorry
to
have
Mr.
Jaggers
and
Wemmick
*NL*
together
,
as
Wemmick
would
then
hear
for
himself
that
I
said
nothing
to
*NL*
compromise
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
appearance
,
with
my
arm
bandaged
and
my
coat
loose
over
my
shoulders
,
*NL*
favored
my
object
.
Although
I
had
sent
Mr.
Jaggers
a
brief
account
of
*NL*
the
accident
as
soon
as
I
had
arrived
in
town
,
yet
I
had
to
give
him
all
*NL*
the
details
now
;
and
the
speciality
of
the
occasion
caused
our
talk
*NL*
to
be
less
dry
and
hard
,
and
less
strictly
regulated
by
the
rules
of
*NL*
evidence
,
than
it
had
been
before
.
While
I
described
the
disaster
,
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
stood
,
according
to
his
wont
,
before
the
fire
.
Wemmick
leaned
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
,
staring
at
me
,
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
*NL*
trousers
,
and
his
pen
put
horizontally
into
the
post
.
The
two
brutal
*NL*
casts
,
always
inseparable
in
my
mind
from
the
official
proceedings
,
*NL*
seemed
to
be
congestively
considering
whether
they
did
n't
smell
fire
at
*NL*
the
present
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
narrative
finished
,
and
their
questions
exhausted
,
I
then
produced
*NL*
Miss
Havisham
's
authority
to
receive
the
nine
hundred
pounds
for
*NL*
Herbert
.
Mr.
Jaggers
's
eyes
retired
a
little
deeper
into
his
head
when
*NL*
I
handed
him
the
tablets
,
but
he
presently
handed
them
over
to
Wemmick
,
*NL*
with
instructions
to
draw
the
check
for
his
signature
.
While
that
was
*NL*
in
course
of
being
done
,
I
looked
on
at
Wemmick
as
he
wrote
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
,
poising
and
swaying
himself
on
his
well-polished
boots
,
looked
*NL*
on
at
me
.
``
I
am
sorry
,
Pip
,
''
said
he
,
as
I
put
the
check
in
my
pocket
,
*NL*
when
he
had
signed
it
,
``
that
we
do
nothing
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Havisham
was
good
enough
to
ask
me
,
''
I
returned
,
``
whether
she
*NL*
could
do
nothing
for
me
,
and
I
told
her
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
should
know
his
own
business
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
And
I
saw
*NL*
Wemmick
's
lips
form
the
words
``
portable
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
told
her
No
,
if
I
had
been
you
,
''
said
Mr
Jaggers
;
*NL*
``
but
every
man
ought
to
know
his
own
business
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
man
's
business
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
rather
reproachfully
towards
me
,
*NL*
``
is
portable
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
thought
the
time
was
now
come
for
pursuing
the
theme
I
had
at
*NL*
heart
,
I
said
,
turning
on
Mr.
Jaggers
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
ask
something
of
Miss
Havisham
,
however
,
sir
.
I
asked
her
to
give
*NL*
me
some
information
relative
to
her
adopted
daughter
,
and
she
gave
me
*NL*
all
she
possessed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
bending
forward
to
look
at
his
boots
and
*NL*
then
straightening
himself
.
``
Hah
!
I
do
n't
think
I
should
have
done
so
,
*NL*
if
I
had
been
Miss
Havisham
.
But
she
ought
to
know
her
own
business
*NL*
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
more
of
the
history
of
Miss
Havisham
's
adopted
child
than
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
herself
does
,
sir
.
I
know
her
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
looked
at
me
inquiringly
,
and
repeated
``
Mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
her
mother
within
these
three
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
have
you
,
sir
.
And
you
have
seen
her
still
more
recently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
know
more
of
Estella
's
history
than
even
you
do
,
''
said
I.
``
I
*NL*
know
her
father
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
stop
that
Mr.
Jaggers
came
to
in
his
manner
--
he
was
too
*NL*
self-possessed
to
change
his
manner
,
but
he
could
not
help
its
being
*NL*
brought
to
an
indefinably
attentive
stop
--
assured
me
that
he
did
not
*NL*
know
who
her
father
was
.
This
I
had
strongly
suspected
from
Provis
's
*NL*
account
-LRB-
as
Herbert
had
repeated
it
-RRB-
of
his
having
kept
himself
dark
;
*NL*
which
I
pieced
on
to
the
fact
that
he
himself
was
not
Mr.
Jaggers
's
*NL*
client
until
some
four
years
later
,
and
when
he
could
have
no
reason
for
*NL*
claiming
his
identity
.
But
,
I
could
not
be
sure
of
this
unconsciousness
*NL*
on
Mr.
Jaggers
's
part
before
,
though
I
was
quite
sure
of
it
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
!
You
know
the
young
lady
's
father
,
Pip
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
replied
,
``
and
his
name
is
Provis
--
from
New
South
Wales
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Mr.
Jaggers
started
when
I
said
those
words
.
It
was
the
slightest
*NL*
start
that
could
escape
a
man
,
the
most
carefully
repressed
and
the
*NL*
sooner
checked
,
but
he
did
start
,
though
he
made
it
a
part
of
the
*NL*
action
of
taking
out
his
pocket-handkerchief
.
How
Wemmick
received
the
*NL*
announcement
I
am
unable
to
say
;
for
I
was
afraid
to
look
at
him
just
*NL*
then
,
lest
Mr.
Jaggers
's
sharpness
should
detect
that
there
had
been
*NL*
some
communication
unknown
to
him
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
on
what
evidence
,
Pip
,
''
asked
Mr.
Jaggers
,
very
coolly
,
as
he
*NL*
paused
with
his
handkerchief
half
way
to
his
nose
,
``
does
Provis
make
*NL*
this
claim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
not
make
it
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
has
never
made
it
,
and
has
no
*NL*
knowledge
or
belief
that
his
daughter
is
in
existence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
once
,
the
powerful
pocket-handkerchief
failed
.
My
reply
was
so
*NL*
unexpected
,
that
Mr.
Jaggers
put
the
handkerchief
back
into
his
pocket
*NL*
without
completing
the
usual
performance
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
looked
*NL*
with
stern
attention
at
me
,
though
with
an
immovable
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
told
him
all
I
knew
,
and
how
I
knew
it
;
with
the
one
reservation
*NL*
that
I
left
him
to
infer
that
I
knew
from
Miss
Havisham
what
I
in
fact
*NL*
knew
from
Wemmick
.
I
was
very
careful
indeed
as
to
that
.
Nor
did
I
look
*NL*
towards
Wemmick
until
I
had
finished
all
I
had
to
tell
,
and
had
been
for
*NL*
some
time
silently
meeting
Mr.
Jaggers
's
look
.
When
I
did
at
last
turn
*NL*
my
eyes
in
Wemmick
's
direction
,
I
found
that
he
had
unposted
his
pen
,
*NL*
and
was
intent
upon
the
table
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hah
!
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
at
last
,
as
he
moved
towards
the
papers
on
the
*NL*
table
.
``
What
item
was
it
you
were
at
,
Wemmick
,
when
Mr.
Pip
came
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
could
not
submit
to
be
thrown
off
in
that
way
,
and
I
made
a
*NL*
passionate
,
almost
an
indignant
appeal
,
to
him
to
be
more
frank
and
*NL*
manly
with
me
.
I
reminded
him
of
the
false
hopes
into
which
I
had
*NL*
lapsed
,
the
length
of
time
they
had
lasted
,
and
the
discovery
I
had
*NL*
made
:
and
I
hinted
at
the
danger
that
weighed
upon
my
spirits
.
I
*NL*
represented
myself
as
being
surely
worthy
of
some
little
confidence
from
*NL*
him
,
in
return
for
the
confidence
I
had
just
now
imparted
.
I
said
that
*NL*
I
did
not
blame
him
,
or
suspect
him
,
or
mistrust
him
,
but
I
wanted
*NL*
assurance
of
the
truth
from
him
.
And
if
he
asked
me
why
I
wanted
it
,
*NL*
and
why
I
thought
I
had
any
right
to
it
,
I
would
tell
him
,
little
as
he
*NL*
cared
for
such
poor
dreams
,
that
I
had
loved
Estella
dearly
and
long
,
*NL*
and
that
although
I
had
lost
her
,
and
must
live
a
bereaved
life
,
*NL*
whatever
concerned
her
was
still
nearer
and
dearer
to
me
than
anything
*NL*
else
in
the
world
.
And
seeing
that
Mr.
Jaggers
stood
quite
still
and
*NL*
silent
,
and
apparently
quite
obdurate
,
under
this
appeal
,
I
turned
to
*NL*
Wemmick
,
and
said
,
``
Wemmick
,
I
know
you
to
be
a
man
with
a
gentle
*NL*
heart
.
I
have
seen
your
pleasant
home
,
and
your
old
father
,
and
all
the
*NL*
innocent
,
cheerful
playful
ways
with
which
you
refresh
your
business
*NL*
life
.
And
I
entreat
you
to
say
a
word
for
me
to
Mr.
Jaggers
,
and
to
*NL*
represent
to
him
that
,
all
circumstances
considered
,
he
ought
to
be
more
*NL*
open
with
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
never
seen
two
men
look
more
oddly
at
one
another
than
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
and
Wemmick
did
after
this
apostrophe
.
At
first
,
a
misgiving
*NL*
crossed
me
that
Wemmick
would
be
instantly
dismissed
from
his
*NL*
employment
;
but
it
melted
as
I
saw
Mr.
Jaggers
relax
into
something
like
*NL*
a
smile
,
and
Wemmick
become
bolder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
all
this
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
``
You
with
an
old
father
,
and
you
*NL*
with
pleasant
and
playful
ways
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
returned
Wemmick
.
``
If
I
do
n't
bring
'em
here
,
what
does
it
*NL*
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
laying
his
hand
upon
my
arm
,
and
smiling
*NL*
openly
,
``
this
man
must
be
the
most
cunning
impostor
in
all
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
''
returned
Wemmick
,
growing
bolder
and
bolder
.
``
I
think
*NL*
you
're
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
they
exchanged
their
former
odd
looks
,
each
apparently
still
*NL*
distrustful
that
the
other
was
taking
him
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
with
a
pleasant
home
?
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
it
do
n't
interfere
with
business
,
''
returned
Wemmick
,
``
let
it
be
*NL*
so
.
Now
,
I
look
at
you
,
sir
,
I
should
n't
wonder
if
you
might
be
planning
*NL*
and
contriving
to
have
a
pleasant
home
of
your
own
one
of
these
days
,
*NL*
when
you
're
tired
of
all
this
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jaggers
nodded
his
head
retrospectively
two
or
three
times
,
and
*NL*
actually
drew
a
sigh
.
``
Pip
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
wo
n't
talk
about
`
poor
*NL*
dreams
;
'
you
know
more
about
such
things
than
I
,
having
much
fresher
*NL*
experience
of
that
kind
.
But
now
about
this
other
matter
.
I
'll
put
a
*NL*
case
to
you
.
Mind
!
I
admit
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
for
me
to
declare
that
I
quite
understood
that
he
expressly
*NL*
said
that
he
admitted
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Pip

''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
``
put
this

Put
the
case

a

under
such
circumstances

her
child
*NL*
concealed
,

was
obliged
to
communicate
the

stood
about
that

at
the

held

find
a

rich

to
adopt
and
bring
up
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
follow
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
the
case
that
he
lived
in
an

saw
of

their
being
generated
in
great

destruction

he
often

children
solemnly

out

could

no

over

``
I
ask

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
whose

the
better
for

For

I

think

she
had
done
such
a
deed
she
would
be
safer
where
she
was

For
the

I
think
it
would
hardly
serve
her
to
establish
her

parentage
for
the
information
of
her
husband

and
to
drag
her
back
to

disgrace

after

escape
of
twenty

pretty
secure
to
last
for

life

But
add
the
case
that
you
had
loved
her
,
Pip

and
had
made
her
the
*NL*
subject
of
those
`
poor
dreams

have
,
at
one
time

another
,
been
*NL*
in

heads

more

I
tell
you
that
you
*NL*
had
better

would
much
sooner

you
had
thought
well

it

chop
*NL*
off
that
bandaged
left
hand
of
yours
with
your
bandaged
right
hand
,
and
*NL*
then
pass
the
chopper
on
to
Wemmick
there
,
to
cut
that
off
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
Wemmick
,
whose
face
was
very
grave
.
He
gravely
touched
his
*NL*
lips
with
his
forefinger
.
I
did
the
same
.
Mr.
Jaggers
did
the
same
.
*NL*
``
Now
,
Wemmick
,
''
said
the
latter
then
,
resuming
his
usual
manner
,
``
what
*NL*
item
was
it
you
were
at
when
Mr.
Pip
came
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
by
for
a
little
,
while
they
were
at
work
,
I
observed
that
the
*NL*
odd
looks
they
had
cast
at
one
another
were
repeated
several
times
:
with
*NL*
this
difference
now
,
that
each
of
them
seemed
suspicious
,
not
to
say
*NL*
conscious
,
of
having
shown
himself
in
a
weak
and
unprofessional
light
to
*NL*
the
other
.
For
this
reason
,
I
suppose
,
they
were
now
inflexible
with
one
*NL*
another
;
Mr.
Jaggers
being
highly
dictatorial
,
and
Wemmick
obstinately
*NL*
justifying
himself
whenever
there
was
the
smallest
point
in
abeyance
for
*NL*
a
moment
.
I
had
never
seen
them
on
such
ill
terms
;
for
generally
they
*NL*
got
on
very
well
indeed
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
were
both
happily
relieved
by
the
opportune
appearance
of
Mike
,
*NL*
the
client
with
the
fur
cap
and
the
habit
of
wiping
his
nose
on
his
*NL*
sleeve
,
whom
I
had
seen
on
the
very
first
day
of
my
appearance
within
*NL*
those
walls
.
This
individual
,
who
,
either
in
his
own
person
or
in
that
*NL*
of
some
member
of
his
family
,
seemed
to
be
always
in
trouble
-LRB-
which
in
*NL*
that
place
meant
Newgate
-RRB-
,
called
to
announce
that
his
eldest
daughter
*NL*
was
taken
up
on
suspicion
of
shoplifting
.
As
he
imparted
this
melancholy
*NL*
circumstance
to
Wemmick
,
Mr.
Jaggers
standing
magisterially
before
the
*NL*
fire
and
taking
no
share
in
the
proceedings
,
Mike
's
eye
happened
to
*NL*
twinkle
with
a
tear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
about
?
''
demanded
Wemmick
,
with
the
utmost
indignation
.
*NL*
``
What
do
you
come
snivelling
here
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
go
to
do
it
,
Mr.
Wemmick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
,
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
How
dare
you
?
You
're
not
in
a
fit
state
to
*NL*
come
here
,
if
you
ca
n't
come
here
without
spluttering
like
a
bad
pen
.
*NL*
What
do
you
mean
by
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
ca
n't
help
his
feelings
,
Mr.
Wemmick
,
''
pleaded
Mike
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
what
?
''
demanded
Wemmick
,
quite
savagely
.
``
Say
that
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
look
here
my
man
,
''
said
Mr.
Jaggers
,
advancing
a
step
,
and
pointing
*NL*
to
the
door
.
``
Get
out
of
this
office
.
I
'll
have
no
feelings
here
.
Get
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
serves
you
right
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
Get
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
the
unfortunate
Mike
very
humbly
withdrew
,
and
Mr.
Jaggers
and
*NL*
Wemmick
appeared
to
have
re-established
their
good
understanding
,
and
*NL*
went
to
work
again
with
an
air
of
refreshment
upon
them
as
if
they
had
*NL*
just
had
lunch
.

*NL*
*NL*
From
Little
Britain
I
went
,
with
my
check
in
my
pocket
,
to
Miss
*NL*
Skiffins
's
brother
,
the
accountant
;
and
Miss
Skiffins
's
brother
,
the
*NL*
accountant
,
going
straight
to
Clarriker
's
and
bringing
Clarriker
to
me
,
*NL*
I
had
the
great
satisfaction
of
concluding
that
arrangement
.
It
was
the
*NL*
only
good
thing
I
had
done
,
and
the
only
completed
thing
I
had
done
,
*NL*
since
I
was
first
apprised
of
my
great
expectations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clarriker
informing
me
on
that
occasion
that
the
affairs
of
the
House
*NL*
were
steadily
progressing
,
that
he
would
now
be
able
to
establish
a
*NL*
small
branch-house
in
the
East
which
was
much
wanted
for
the
extension
*NL*
of
the
business
,
and
that
Herbert
in
his
new
partnership
capacity
would
*NL*
go
out
and
take
charge
of
it
,
I
found
that
I
must
have
prepared
for
*NL*
a
separation
from
my
friend
,
even
though
my
own
affairs
had
been
more
*NL*
settled
.
And
now
,
indeed
,
I
felt
as
if
my
last
anchor
were
loosening
its
*NL*
hold
,
and
I
should
soon
be
driving
with
the
winds
and
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
recompense
in
the
joy
with
which
Herbert
would
come
home
*NL*
of
a
night
and
tell
me
of
these
changes
,
little
imagining
that
he
told
*NL*
me
no
news
,
and
would
sketch
airy
pictures
of
himself
conducting
Clara
*NL*
Barley
to
the
land
of
the
Arabian
Nights
,
and
of
me
going
out
to
join
*NL*
them
-LRB-
with
a
caravan
of
camels
,
I
believe
-RRB-
,
and
of
our
all
going
up
the
*NL*
Nile
and
seeing
wonders
.
Without
being
sanguine
as
to
my
own
part
in
*NL*
those
bright
plans
,
I
felt
that
Herbert
's
way
was
clearing
fast
,
and
*NL*
that
old
Bill
Barley
had
but
to
stick
to
his
pepper
and
rum
,
and
his
*NL*
daughter
would
soon
be
happily
provided
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
now
got
into
the
month
of
March
.
My
left
arm
,
though
it
presented
*NL*
no
bad
symptoms
,
took
,
in
the
natural
course
,
so
long
to
heal
that
I
*NL*
was
still
unable
to
get
a
coat
on
.
My
right
arm
was
tolerably
restored
;
*NL*
disfigured
,
but
fairly
serviceable
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
Monday
morning
,
when
Herbert
and
I
were
at
breakfast
,
I
received
*NL*
the
following
letter
from
Wemmick
by
the
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walworth
.
Burn
this
as
soon
as
read
.
Early
in
the
week
,
or
say
*NL*
Wednesday
,
you
might
do
what
you
know
of
,
if
you
felt
disposed
to
try
*NL*
it
.
Now
burn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
shown
this
to
Herbert
and
had
put
it
in
the
fire
--
but
not
*NL*
before
we
had
both
got
it
by
heart
--
we
considered
what
to
do
.
For
,
of
*NL*
course
my
being
disabled
could
now
be
no
longer
kept
out
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
it
over
again
and
again
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
and
I
think
I
*NL*
know
a
better
course
than
taking
a
Thames
waterman
.
Take
Startop
.
A
good
*NL*
fellow
,
a
skilled
hand
,
fond
of
us
,
and
enthusiastic
and
honorable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
thought
of
him
more
than
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
much
would
you
tell
him
,
Herbert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
necessary
to
tell
him
very
little
.
Let
him
suppose
it
a
mere
*NL*
freak
,
but
a
secret
one
,
until
the
morning
comes
:
then
let
him
know
that
*NL*
there
is
urgent
reason
for
your
getting
Provis
aboard
and
away
.
You
go
*NL*
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
seemed
to
me
,
in
the
many
anxious
considerations
I
had
given
the
*NL*
point
,
almost
indifferent
what
port
we
made
for
,
--
Hamburg
,
Rotterdam
,
*NL*
Antwerp
,
--
the
place
signified
little
,
so
that
he
was
out
of
England
.
Any
*NL*
foreign
steamer
that
fell
in
our
way
and
would
take
us
up
would
do
.
*NL*
I
had
always
proposed
to
myself
to
get
him
well
down
the
river
in
the
*NL*
boat
;
certainly
well
beyond
Gravesend
,
which
was
a
critical
place
for
*NL*
search
or
inquiry
if
suspicion
were
afoot
.
As
foreign
steamers
would
*NL*
leave
London
at
about
the
time
of
high-water
,
our
plan
would
be
to
get
*NL*
down
the
river
by
a
previous
ebb-tide
,
and
lie
by
in
some
quiet
spot
*NL*
until
we
could
pull
off
to
one
.
The
time
when
one
would
be
due
where
we
*NL*
lay
,
wherever
that
might
be
,
could
be
calculated
pretty
nearly
,
if
we
*NL*
made
inquiries
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
assented
to
all
this
,
and
we
went
out
immediately
after
*NL*
breakfast
to
pursue
our
investigations
.
We
found
that
a
steamer
for
*NL*
Hamburg
was
likely
to
suit
our
purpose
best
,
and
we
directed
our
*NL*
thoughts
chiefly
to
that
vessel
.
But
we
noted
down
what
other
foreign
*NL*
steamers
would
leave
London
with
the
same
tide
,
and
we
satisfied
*NL*
ourselves
that
we
knew
the
build
and
color
of
each
.
We
then
separated
*NL*
for
a
few
hours
:
I
,
to
get
at
once
such
passports
as
were
necessary
;
*NL*
Herbert
,
to
see
Startop
at
his
lodgings
.
We
both
did
what
we
had
to
do
*NL*
without
any
hindrance
,
and
when
we
met
again
at
one
o'clock
reported
*NL*
it
done
.
I
,
for
my
part
,
was
prepared
with
passports
;
Herbert
had
seen
*NL*
Startop
,
and
he
was
more
than
ready
to
join
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
two
should
pull
a
pair
of
oars
,
we
settled
,
and
I
would
steer
;
our
*NL*
charge
would
be
sitter
,
and
keep
quiet
;
as
speed
was
not
our
object
,
we
*NL*
should
make
way
enough
.
We
arranged
that
Herbert
should
not
come
home
to
*NL*
dinner
before
going
to
Mill
Pond
Bank
that
evening
;
that
he
should
*NL*
not
go
there
at
all
to-morrow
evening
,
Tuesday
;
that
he
should
prepare
*NL*
Provis
to
come
down
to
some
stairs
hard
by
the
house
,
on
Wednesday
,
when
*NL*
he
saw
us
approach
,
and
not
sooner
;
that
all
the
arrangements
with
*NL*
him
should
be
concluded
that
Monday
night
;
and
that
he
should
be
*NL*
communicated
with
no
more
in
any
way
,
until
we
took
him
on
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
precautions
well
understood
by
both
of
us
,
I
went
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
opening
the
outer
door
of
our
chambers
with
my
key
,
I
found
a
letter
*NL*
in
the
box
,
directed
to
me
;
a
very
dirty
letter
,
though
not
ill-written
.
*NL*
It
had
been
delivered
by
hand
-LRB-
of
course
,
since
I
left
home
-RRB-
,
and
its
*NL*
contents
were
these
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
not
afraid
to
come
to
the
old
marshes
to-night
or
to-morrow
*NL*
night
at
nine
,
and
to
come
to
the
little
sluice-house
by
the
limekiln
,
*NL*
you
had
better
come
.
If
you
want
information
regarding
your
uncle
*NL*
Provis
,
you
had
much
better
come
and
tell
no
one
,
and
lose
no
time
.
You
*NL*
must
come
alone
.
Bring
this
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
had
load
enough
upon
my
mind
before
the
receipt
of
this
strange
*NL*
letter
.
What
to
do
now
,
I
could
not
tell
.
And
the
worst
was
,
that
I
must
*NL*
decide
quickly
,
or
I
should
miss
the
afternoon
coach
,
which
would
take
*NL*
me
down
in
time
for
to-night
.
To-morrow
night
I
could
not
think
of
*NL*
going
,
for
it
would
be
too
close
upon
the
time
of
the
flight
.
And
again
,
*NL*
for
anything
I
knew
,
the
proffered
information
might
have
some
important
*NL*
bearing
on
the
flight
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
had
had
ample
time
for
consideration
,
I
believe
I
should
still
have
*NL*
gone
.
Having
hardly
any
time
for
consideration
,
--
my
watch
showing
me
*NL*
that
the
coach
started
within
half
an
hour
,
--
I
resolved
to
go
.
I
should
*NL*
certainly
not
have
gone
,
but
for
the
reference
to
my
Uncle
Provis
.
That
,
*NL*
coming
on
Wemmick
's
letter
and
the
morning
's
busy
preparation
,
turned
*NL*
the
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
so
difficult
to
become
clearly
possessed
of
the
contents
of
almost
*NL*
any
letter
,
in
a
violent
hurry
,
that
I
had
to
read
this
mysterious
*NL*
epistle
again
twice
,
before
its
injunction
to
me
to
be
secret
got
*NL*
mechanically
into
my
mind
.
Yielding
to
it
in
the
same
mechanical
kind
of
*NL*
way
,
I
left
a
note
in
pencil
for
Herbert
,
telling
him
that
as
I
should
*NL*
be
so
soon
going
away
,
I
knew
not
for
how
long
,
I
had
decided
to
hurry
*NL*
down
and
back
,
to
ascertain
for
myself
how
Miss
Havisham
was
faring
.
*NL*
I
had
then
barely
time
to
get
my
great-coat
,
lock
up
the
chambers
,
*NL*
and
make
for
the
coach-office
by
the
short
by-ways
.
If
I
had
taken
a
*NL*
hackney-chariot
and
gone
by
the
streets
,
I
should
have
missed
my
aim
;
*NL*
going
as
I
did
,
I
caught
the
coach
just
as
it
came
out
of
the
yard
.
I
*NL*
was
the
only
inside
passenger
,
jolting
away
knee-deep
in
straw
,
when
I
*NL*
came
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
I
really
had
not
been
myself
since
the
receipt
of
the
letter
;
it
had
*NL*
so
bewildered
me
,
ensuing
on
the
hurry
of
the
morning
.
The
morning
hurry
*NL*
and
flutter
had
been
great
;
for
,
long
and
anxiously
as
I
had
waited
for
*NL*
Wemmick
,
his
hint
had
come
like
a
surprise
at
last
.
And
now
I
began
*NL*
to
wonder
at
myself
for
being
in
the
coach
,
and
to
doubt
whether
I
had
*NL*
sufficient
reason
for
being
there
,
and
to
consider
whether
I
should
*NL*
get
out
presently
and
go
back
,
and
to
argue
against
ever
heeding
an
*NL*
anonymous
communication
,
and
,
in
short
,
to
pass
through
all
those
phases
*NL*
of
contradiction
and
indecision
to
which
I
suppose
very
few
hurried
*NL*
people
are
strangers
.
Still
,
the
reference
to
Provis
by
name
mastered
*NL*
everything
.
I
reasoned
as
I
had
reasoned
already
without
knowing
it
,
--
if
*NL*
that
be
reasoning
,
--
in
case
any
harm
should
befall
him
through
my
not
*NL*
going
,
how
could
I
ever
forgive
myself
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dark
before
we
got
down
,
and
the
journey
seemed
long
and
dreary
*NL*
to
me
,
who
could
see
little
of
it
inside
,
and
who
could
not
go
outside
*NL*
in
my
disabled
state
.
Avoiding
the
Blue
Boar
,
I
put
up
at
an
inn
of
*NL*
minor
reputation
down
the
town
,
and
ordered
some
dinner
.
While
it
was
*NL*
preparing
,
I
went
to
Satis
House
and
inquired
for
Miss
Havisham
;
she
was
*NL*
still
very
ill
,
though
considered
something
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
inn
had
once
been
a
part
of
an
ancient
ecclesiastical
house
,
and
I
*NL*
dined
in
a
little
octagonal
common-room
,
like
a
font
.
As
I
was
not
able
*NL*
to
cut
my
dinner
,
the
old
landlord
with
a
shining
bald
head
did
it
for
*NL*
me
.
This
bringing
us
into
conversation
,
he
was
so
good
as
to
entertain
*NL*
me
with
my
own
story
,
--
of
course
with
the
popular
feature
that
*NL*
Pumblechook
was
my
earliest
benefactor
and
the
founder
of
my
fortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
the
young
man
?
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
him
!
''
repeated
the
landlord
.
``
Ever
since
he
was
--
no
height
at
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
ever
come
back
to
this
neighborhood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
he
comes
back
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
``
to
his
great
friends
,
now
and
*NL*
again
,
and
gives
the
cold
shoulder
to
the
man
that
made
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
man
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Him
that
I
speak
of
,
''
said
the
landlord
.
``
Mr.
Pumblechook
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
ungrateful
to
no
one
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
he
would
be
,
if
he
could
,
''
returned
the
landlord
,
``
but
he
*NL*
ca
n't
.
And
why
?
Because
Pumblechook
done
everything
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
Pumblechook
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
so
!
''
replied
the
landlord
.
``
He
ha
n't
no
call
to
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
does
he
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
turn
a
man
's
blood
to
white
wine
winegar
to
hear
him
tell
of
*NL*
it
,
sir
,
''
said
the
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
,
``
Yet
Joe
,
dear
Joe
,
you
never
tell
of
it
.
Long-suffering
and
*NL*
loving
Joe
,
you
never
complain
.
Nor
you
,
sweet-tempered
Biddy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
appetite
's
been
touched
like
by
your
accident
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
*NL*
glancing
at
the
bandaged
arm
under
my
coat
.
``
Try
a
tenderer
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
I
replied
,
turning
from
the
table
to
brood
over
the
*NL*
fire
.
``
I
can
eat
no
more
.
Please
take
it
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
been
struck
at
so
keenly
,
for
my
thanklessness
to
Joe
,
as
*NL*
through
the
brazen
impostor
Pumblechook
.
The
falser
he
,
the
truer
Joe
;
*NL*
the
meaner
he
,
the
nobler
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
was
deeply
and
most
deservedly
humbled
as
I
mused
over
the
fire
*NL*
for
an
hour
or
more
.
The
striking
of
the
clock
aroused
me
,
but
not
from
*NL*
my
dejection
or
remorse
,
and
I
got
up
and
had
my
coat
fastened
round
*NL*
my
neck
,
and
went
out
.
I
had
previously
sought
in
my
pockets
for
the
*NL*
letter
,
that
I
might
refer
to
it
again
;
but
I
could
not
find
it
,
and
*NL*
was
uneasy
to
think
that
it
must
have
been
dropped
in
the
straw
of
*NL*
the
coach
.
I
knew
very
well
,
however
,
that
the
appointed
place
was
the
*NL*
little
sluice-house
by
the
limekiln
on
the
marshes
,
and
the
hour
nine
.
*NL*
Towards
the
marshes
I
now
went
straight
,
having
no
time
to
spare
.
*NL*

*NL*
Chapter
LIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
dark
night
,
though
the
full
moon
rose
as
I
left
the
enclosed
*NL*
lands
,
and
passed
out
upon
the
marshes
.
Beyond
their
dark
line
there
was
*NL*
a
ribbon
of
clear
sky
,
hardly
broad
enough
to
hold
the
red
large
moon
.
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
she
had
ascended
out
of
that
clear
field
,
in
among
the
*NL*
piled
mountains
of
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
melancholy
wind
,
and
the
marshes
were
very
dismal
.
A
*NL*
stranger
would
have
found
them
insupportable
,
and
even
to
me
they
were
*NL*
so
oppressive
that
I
hesitated
,
half
inclined
to
go
back
.
But
I
knew
*NL*
them
well
,
and
could
have
found
my
way
on
a
far
darker
night
,
and
had
*NL*
no
excuse
for
returning
,
being
there
.
So
,
having
come
there
against
my
*NL*
inclination
,
I
went
on
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
direction
that
I
took
was
not
that
in
which
my
old
home
lay
,
nor
*NL*
that
in
which
we
had
pursued
the
convicts
.
My
back
was
turned
towards
*NL*
the
distant
Hulks
as
I
walked
on
,
and
,
though
I
could
see
the
old
lights
*NL*
away
on
the
spits
of
sand
,
I
saw
them
over
my
shoulder
.
I
knew
the
*NL*
limekiln
as
well
as
I
knew
the
old
Battery
,
but
they
were
miles
apart
;
*NL*
so
that
,
if
a
light
had
been
burning
at
each
point
that
night
,
there
*NL*
would
have
been
a
long
strip
of
the
blank
horizon
between
the
two
bright
*NL*
specks
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
I
had
to
shut
some
gates
after
me
,
and
now
and
then
to
stand
*NL*
still
while
the
cattle
that
were
lying
in
the
banked-up
pathway
arose
*NL*
and
blundered
down
among
the
grass
and
reeds
.
But
after
a
little
while
I
*NL*
seemed
to
have
the
whole
flats
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
another
half-hour
before
I
drew
near
to
the
kiln
.
The
lime
was
*NL*
burning
with
a
sluggish
stifling
smell
,
but
the
fires
were
made
up
and
*NL*
left
,
and
no
workmen
were
visible
.
Hard
by
was
a
small
stone-quarry
.
It
*NL*
lay
directly
in
my
way
,
and
had
been
worked
that
day
,
as
I
saw
by
the
*NL*
tools
and
barrows
that
were
lying
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
up
again
to
the
marsh
level
out
of
this
excavation
,
--
for
the
rude
*NL*
path
lay
through
it
,
--
I
saw
a
light
in
the
old
sluice-house
.
I
quickened
*NL*
my
pace
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
with
my
hand
.
Waiting
for
some
reply
,
*NL*
I
looked
about
me
,
noticing
how
the
sluice
was
abandoned
and
broken
,
and
*NL*
how
the
house
--
of
wood
with
a
tiled
roof
--
would
not
be
proof
against
the
*NL*
weather
much
longer
,
if
it
were
so
even
now
,
and
how
the
mud
and
ooze
*NL*
were
coated
with
lime
,
and
how
the
choking
vapor
of
the
kiln
crept
in
a
*NL*
ghostly
way
towards
me
.
Still
there
was
no
answer
,
and
I
knocked
again
.
*NL*
No
answer
still
,
and
I
tried
the
latch
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
rose
under
my
hand
,
and
the
door
yielded
.
Looking
in
,
I
saw
a
lighted
*NL*
candle
on
a
table
,
a
bench
,
and
a
mattress
on
a
truckle
bedstead
.
As
*NL*
there
was
a
loft
above
,
I
called
,
``
Is
there
any
one
here
?
''
but
no
voice
*NL*
answered
.
Then
I
looked
at
my
watch
,
and
,
finding
that
it
was
past
nine
,
*NL*
called
again
,
``
Is
there
any
one
here
?
''
There
being
still
no
answer
,
I
*NL*
went
out
at
the
door
,
irresolute
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
beginning
to
rain
fast
.
Seeing
nothing
save
what
I
had
seen
*NL*
already
,
I
turned
back
into
the
house
,
and
stood
just
within
the
shelter
*NL*
of
the
doorway
,
looking
out
into
the
night
.
While
I
was
considering
that
*NL*
some
one
must
have
been
there
lately
and
must
soon
be
coming
back
,
or
*NL*
the
candle
would
not
be
burning
,
it
came
into
my
head
to
look
if
the
*NL*
wick
were
long
.
I
turned
round
to
do
so
,
and
had
taken
up
the
candle
in
*NL*
my
hand
,
when
it
was
extinguished
by
some
violent
shock
;
and
the
next
*NL*
thing
I
comprehended
was
,
that
I
had
been
caught
in
a
strong
running
*NL*
noose
,
thrown
over
my
head
from
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
a
suppressed
voice
with
an
oath
,
``
I
've
got
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
?
''
I
cried
,
struggling
.
``
Who
is
it
?
Help
,
help
,
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
were
my
arms
pulled
close
to
my
sides
,
but
the
pressure
on
*NL*
my
bad
arm
caused
me
exquisite
pain
.
Sometimes
,
a
strong
man
's
hand
,
*NL*
sometimes
a
strong
man
's
breast
,
was
set
against
my
mouth
to
deaden
*NL*
my
cries
,
and
with
a
hot
breath
always
close
to
me
,
I
struggled
*NL*
ineffectually
in
the
dark
,
while
I
was
fastened
tight
to
the
wall
.
``
And
*NL*
now
,
''
said
the
suppressed
voice
with
another
oath
,
``
call
out
again
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
make
short
work
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Faint
and
sick
with
the
pain
of
my
injured
arm
,
bewildered
by
the
*NL*
surprise
,
and
yet
conscious
how
easily
this
threat
could
be
put
in
*NL*
execution
,
I
desisted
,
and
tried
to
ease
my
arm
were
it
ever
so
little
.
*NL*
But
,
it
was
bound
too
tight
for
that
.
I
felt
as
if
,
having
been
burnt
*NL*
before
,
it
were
now
being
boiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sudden
exclusion
of
the
night
,
and
the
substitution
of
black
*NL*
darkness
in
its
place
,
warned
me
that
the
man
had
closed
a
shutter
.
*NL*
After
groping
about
for
a
little
,
he
found
the
flint
and
steel
he
*NL*
wanted
,
and
began
to
strike
a
light
.
I
strained
my
sight
upon
the
sparks
*NL*
that
fell
among
the
tinder
,
and
upon
which
he
breathed
and
breathed
,
*NL*
match
in
hand
,
but
I
could
only
see
his
lips
,
and
the
blue
point
of
*NL*
the
match
;
even
those
but
fitfully
.
The
tinder
was
damp
,
--
no
wonder
*NL*
there
,
--
and
one
after
another
the
sparks
died
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
was
in
no
hurry
,
and
struck
again
with
the
flint
and
steel
.
As
*NL*
the
sparks
fell
thick
and
bright
about
him
,
I
could
see
his
hands
,
and
*NL*
touches
of
his
face
,
and
could
make
out
that
he
was
seated
and
bending
*NL*
over
the
table
;
but
nothing
more
.
Presently
I
saw
his
blue
lips
again
,
*NL*
breathing
on
the
tinder
,
and
then
a
flare
of
light
flashed
up
,
and
*NL*
showed
me
Orlick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whom
I
had
looked
for
,
I
do
n't
know
.
I
had
not
looked
for
him
.
Seeing
*NL*
him
,
I
felt
that
I
was
in
a
dangerous
strait
indeed
,
and
I
kept
my
eyes
*NL*
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lighted
the
candle
from
the
flaring
match
with
great
deliberation
,
*NL*
and
dropped
the
match
,
and
trod
it
out
.
Then
he
put
the
candle
away
from
*NL*
him
on
the
table
,
so
that
he
could
see
me
,
and
sat
with
his
arms
folded
*NL*
on
the
table
and
looked
at
me
.
I
made
out
that
I
was
fastened
to
a
stout
*NL*
perpendicular
ladder
a
few
inches
from
the
wall
,
--
a
fixture
there
,
--
the
*NL*
means
of
ascent
to
the
loft
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
when
we
had
surveyed
one
another
for
some
time
,
``
I
've
*NL*
got
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unbind
me
.
Let
me
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
returned
,
``
I
'll
let
you
go
.
I
'll
let
you
go
to
the
moon
,
I
'll
*NL*
let
you
go
to
the
stars
.
All
in
good
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
lured
me
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
?
''
said
he
,
with
a
deadly
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
set
upon
me
in
the
dark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
mean
to
do
it
all
myself
.
One
keeps
a
secret
better
than
two
.
*NL*
O
you
enemy
,
you
enemy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
enjoyment
of
the
spectacle
I
furnished
,
as
he
sat
with
his
arms
*NL*
folded
on
the
table
,
shaking
his
head
at
me
and
hugging
himself
,
had
a
*NL*
malignity
in
it
that
made
me
tremble
.
As
I
watched
him
in
silence
,
*NL*
he
put
his
hand
into
the
corner
at
his
side
,
and
took
up
a
gun
with
a
*NL*
brass-bound
stock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
this
?
''
said
he
,
making
as
if
he
would
take
aim
at
me
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
know
where
you
saw
it
afore
?
Speak
,
wolf
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
cost
me
that
place
.
You
did
.
Speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
could
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
that
,
and
that
would
be
enough
,
without
more
.
How
dared
you
to
*NL*
come
betwixt
me
and
a
young
woman
I
liked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
n't
you
?
It
was
you
as
always
give
Old
Orlick
a
bad
name
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
gave
it
to
yourself
;
you
gained
it
for
yourself
.
I
could
have
done
*NL*
you
no
harm
,
if
you
had
done
yourself
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
liar
.
And
you
'll
take
any
pains
,
and
spend
any
money
,
to
drive
*NL*
me
out
of
this
country
,
will
you
?
''
said
he
,
repeating
my
words
to
Biddy
*NL*
in
the
last
interview
I
had
with
her
.
``
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
a
piece
of
*NL*
information
.
It
was
never
so
well
worth
your
while
to
get
me
out
of
this
*NL*
country
as
it
is
to-night
.
Ah
!
If
it
was
all
your
money
twenty
times
*NL*
told
,
to
the
last
brass
farden
!
''
As
he
shook
his
heavy
hand
at
me
,
with
*NL*
his
mouth
snarling
like
a
tiger
's
,
I
felt
that
it
was
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
going
,
''
said
he
,
bringing
his
fist
down
upon
the
table
with
a
*NL*
heavy
blow
,
and
rising
as
the
blow
fell
to
give
it
greater
force
,
--
``
I
'm
*NL*
a
going
to
have
your
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
forward
staring
at
me
,
slowly
unclenched
his
hand
and
drew
it
*NL*
across
his
mouth
as
if
his
mouth
watered
for
me
,
and
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
was
always
in
Old
Orlick
's
way
since
ever
you
was
a
child
.
You
goes
*NL*
out
of
his
way
this
present
night
.
He
'll
have
no
more
on
you
.
You
're
*NL*
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
had
come
to
the
brink
of
my
grave
.
For
a
moment
I
looked
*NL*
wildly
round
my
trap
for
any
chance
of
escape
;
but
there
was
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
that
,
''
said
he
,
folding
his
arms
on
the
table
again
,
``
I
wo
n't
*NL*
have
a
rag
of
you
,
I
wo
n't
have
a
bone
of
you
,
left
on
earth
.
I
'll
put
*NL*
your
body
in
the
kiln
,
--
I
'd
carry
two
such
to
it
,
on
my
Shoulders
,
--
and
,
*NL*
let
people
suppose
what
they
may
of
you
,
they
shall
never
know
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mind
,
with
inconceivable
rapidity
followed
out
all
the
consequences
*NL*
of
such
a
death
.
Estella
's
father
would
believe
I
had
deserted
him
,
*NL*
would
be
taken
,
would
die
accusing
me
;
even
Herbert
would
doubt
me
,
*NL*
when
he
compared
the
letter
I
had
left
for
him
with
the
fact
that
I
had
*NL*
called
at
Miss
Havisham
's
gate
for
only
a
moment
;
Joe
and
Biddy
would
*NL*
never
know
how
sorry
I
had
been
that
night
,
none
would
ever
know
what
*NL*
I
had
suffered
,
how
true
I
had
meant
to
be
,
what
an
agony
I
had
passed
*NL*
through
.
The
death
close
before
me
was
terrible
,
but
far
more
terrible
*NL*
than
death
was
the
dread
of
being
misremembered
after
death
.
And
*NL*
so
quick
were
my
thoughts
,
that
I
saw
myself
despised
by
unborn
*NL*
generations
,
--
Estella
's
children
,
and
their
children
,
--
while
the
*NL*
wretch
's
words
were
yet
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
wolf
,
''
said
he
,
``
afore
I
kill
you
like
any
other
beast
,
--
which
is
*NL*
wot
I
mean
to
do
and
wot
I
have
tied
you
up
for
,
--
I
'll
have
a
good
look
*NL*
at
you
and
a
good
goad
at
you
.
O
you
enemy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
passed
through
my
thoughts
to
cry
out
for
help
again
;
though
*NL*
few
could
know
better
than
I
,
the
solitary
nature
of
the
spot
,
and
the
*NL*
hopelessness
of
aid
.
But
as
he
sat
gloating
over
me
,
I
was
supported
by
*NL*
a
scornful
detestation
of
him
that
sealed
my
lips
.
Above
all
things
,
I
*NL*
resolved
that
I
would
not
entreat
him
,
and
that
I
would
die
making
some
*NL*
last
poor
resistance
to
him
.
Softened
as
my
thoughts
of
all
the
rest
of
*NL*
men
were
in
that
dire
extremity
;
humbly
beseeching
pardon
,
as
I
did
,
of
*NL*
Heaven
;
melted
at
heart
,
as
I
was
,
by
the
thought
that
I
had
taken
no
*NL*
farewell
,
and
never
now
could
take
farewell
of
those
who
were
dear
to
*NL*
me
,
or
could
explain
myself
to
them
,
or
ask
for
their
compassion
on
my
*NL*
miserable
errors
,
--
still
,
if
I
could
have
killed
him
,
even
in
dying
,
I
*NL*
would
have
done
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
drinking
,
and
his
eyes
were
red
and
bloodshot
.
Around
his
*NL*
neck
was
slung
a
tin
bottle
,
as
I
had
often
seen
his
meat
and
drink
*NL*
slung
about
him
in
other
days
.
He
brought
the
bottle
to
his
lips
,
and
*NL*
took
a
fiery
drink
from
it
;
and
I
smelt
the
strong
spirits
that
I
saw
*NL*
flash
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wolf
!
''
said
he
,
folding
his
arms
again
,
``
Old
Orlick
's
a
going
to
tell
*NL*
you
somethink
.
It
was
you
as
did
for
your
shrew
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
my
mind
,
with
its
former
inconceivable
rapidity
,
had
exhausted
the
*NL*
whole
subject
of
the
attack
upon
my
sister
,
her
illness
,
and
her
death
,
*NL*
before
his
slow
and
hesitating
speech
had
formed
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
you
,
villain
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
it
was
your
doing
,
--
I
tell
you
it
was
done
through
you
,
''
he
*NL*
retorted
,
catching
up
the
gun
,
and
making
a
blow
with
the
stock
at
the
*NL*
vacant
air
between
us
.
``
I
come
upon
her
from
behind
,
as
I
come
upon
you
*NL*
to-night
.
I
giv
'
it
her
!
I
left
her
for
dead
,
and
if
there
had
been
a
*NL*
limekiln
as
nigh
her
as
there
is
now
nigh
you
,
she
should
n't
have
come
*NL*
to
life
again
.
But
it
war
n't
Old
Orlick
as
did
it
;
it
was
you
.
You
was
*NL*
favored
,
and
he
was
bullied
and
beat
.
Old
Orlick
bullied
and
beat
,
eh
?
*NL*
Now
you
pays
for
it
.
You
done
it
;
now
you
pays
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drank
again
,
and
became
more
ferocious
.
I
saw
by
his
tilting
of
*NL*
the
bottle
that
there
was
no
great
quantity
left
in
it
.
I
distinctly
*NL*
understood
that
he
was
working
himself
up
with
its
contents
to
make
an
*NL*
end
of
me
.
I
knew
that
every
drop
it
held
was
a
drop
of
my
life
.
I
knew
*NL*
that
when
I
was
changed
into
a
part
of
the
vapor
that
had
crept
towards
*NL*
me
but
a
little
while
before
,
like
my
own
warning
ghost
,
he
would
do
*NL*
as
he
had
done
in
my
sister
's
case
,
--
make
all
haste
to
the
town
,
and
*NL*
be
seen
slouching
about
there
drinking
at
the
alehouses
.
My
rapid
mind
*NL*
pursued
him
to
the
town
,
made
a
picture
of
the
street
with
him
in
it
,
*NL*
and
contrasted
its
lights
and
life
with
the
lonely
marsh
and
the
white
*NL*
vapor
creeping
over
it
,
into
which
I
should
have
dissolved
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
only
that
I
could
have
summed
up
years
and
years
and
years
*NL*
while
he
said
a
dozen
words
,
but
that
what
he
did
say
presented
pictures
*NL*
to
me
,
and
not
mere
words
.
In
the
excited
and
exalted
state
of
my
brain
,
*NL*
I
could
not
think
of
a
place
without
seeing
it
,
or
of
persons
without
*NL*
seeing
them
.
It
is
impossible
to
overstate
the
vividness
of
these
*NL*
images
,
and
yet
I
was
so
intent
,
all
the
time
,
upon
him
himself
,
--
who
*NL*
would
not
be
intent
on
the
tiger
crouching
to
spring
!
--
that
I
knew
of
*NL*
the
slightest
action
of
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
drunk
this
second
time
,
he
rose
from
the
bench
on
which
*NL*
he
sat
,
and
pushed
the
table
aside
.
Then
,
he
took
up
the
candle
,
and
,
*NL*
shading
it
with
his
murderous
hand
so
as
to
throw
its
light
on
me
,
stood
*NL*
before
me
,
looking
at
me
and
enjoying
the
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wolf

I
'll
tell
you
something
more

It
was
Old
Orlick

you
tumbled
*NL*
over
on
your
stairs
that
night

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
the
staircase
with
its
extinguished
lamps
.
I
saw
the
shadows
of
*NL*
the
heavy
stair-rails
,
thrown
by
the
watchman
's
lantern
on
the
wall
.
*NL*
I
saw
the
rooms
that
I
was
never
to
see
again
;
here
,
a
door
half
open
;
*NL*
there

a

around

You

pretty
well
hunted
me
out

so
far

getting
a

I

*NL*
*NL*
In
his
savage
taunting
,
he
flared
the
candle
so
close
at
me
that
I
*NL*
turned
my
face
aside
to
save
it
from
the
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

cried
,
laughing
,
after
doing
it
again
,
``

Ware

Magwitch

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
flared
the
candle
at
me
again
,
smoking
my
face
and
hair
,
and
for
an
*NL*
instant
blinding
me
,
and
turned
his
powerful
back
as
he
replaced
the
*NL*
light
on
the
table
.
I
had
thought
a
prayer
,
and
had
been
with
Joe
and
*NL*
Biddy
and
Herbert
,
before
he
turned
towards
me
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
clear
space
of
a
few
feet
between
the
table
and
the
opposite
*NL*
wall
.
Within
this
space
,
he
now
slouched
backwards
and
forwards
.
His
*NL*
great
strength
seemed
to
sit
stronger
upon
him
than
ever
before
,
as
he
*NL*
did
this
with
his
hands
hanging
loose
and
heavy
at
his
sides
,
and
with
*NL*
his
eyes
scowling
at
me
.
I
had
no
grain
of
hope
left
.
Wild
as
my
inward
*NL*
hurry
was
,
and
wonderful
the
force
of
the
pictures
that
rushed
by
me
*NL*
instead
of
thoughts
,
I
could
yet
clearly
understand
that
,
unless
he
had
*NL*
resolved
that
I
was
within
a
few
moments
of
surely
perishing
out
of
all
*NL*
human
knowledge
,
he
would
never
have
told
me
what
he
had
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
sudden
,
he
stopped
,
took
the
cork
out
of
his
bottle
,
and
tossed
*NL*
it
away
.
Light
as
it
was
,
I
heard
it
fall
like
a
plummet
.
He
swallowed
*NL*
slowly
,
tilting
up
the
bottle
by
little
and
little
,
and
now
he
looked
at
*NL*
me
no
more
.
The
last
few
drops
of
liquor
he
poured
into
the
palm
of
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
licked
up
.
Then
,
with
a
sudden
hurry
of
violence
and
swearing
*NL*
horribly
,
he
threw
the
bottle
from
him
,
and
stooped
;
and
I
saw
in
his
*NL*
hand
a
stone-hammer
with
a
long
heavy
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
resolution
I
had
made
did
not
desert
me
,
for
,
without
uttering
*NL*
one
vain
word
of
appeal
to
him
,
I
shouted
out
with
all
my
might
,
and
*NL*
struggled
with
all
my
might
.
It
was
only
my
head
and
my
legs
that
I
*NL*
could
move
,
but
to
that
extent
I
struggled
with
all
the
force
,
until
*NL*
then
unknown
,
that
was
within
me
.
In
the
same
instant
I
heard
responsive
*NL*
shouts
,
saw
figures
and
a
gleam
of
light
dash
in
at
the
door
,
heard
*NL*
voices
and
tumult
,
and
saw
Orlick
emerge
from
a
struggle
of
men
,
as
if
*NL*
it
were
tumbling
water
,
clear
the
table
at
a
leap
,
and
fly
out
into
the
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
blank
,
I
found
that
I
was
lying
unbound
,
on
the
floor
,
in
the
*NL*
same
place
,
with
my
head
on
some
one
's
knee
.
My
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
*NL*
ladder
against
the
wall
,
when
I
came
to
myself
,
--
had
opened
on
it
before
*NL*
my
mind
saw
it
,
--
and
thus
as
I
recovered
consciousness
,
I
knew
that
I
*NL*
was
in
the
place
where
I
had
lost
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Too
indifferent
at
first
,
even
to
look
round
and
ascertain
who
supported
*NL*
me
,
I
was
lying
looking
at
the
ladder
,
when
there
came
between
me
and
it
*NL*
a
face
.
The
face
of
Trabb
's
boy
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
's
all
right
!
''
said
Trabb
's
boy
,
in
a
sober
voice
;
``
but
ai
n't
*NL*
he
just
pale
though
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
,
the
face
of
him
who
supported
me
looked
over
into
mine
,
*NL*
and
I
saw
my
supporter
to
be
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Herbert
!
Great
Heaven
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Softly
,
''
said
Herbert
.
``
Gently
,
Handel
.
Do
n't
be
too
eager
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
our
old
comrade
,
Startop
!
''
I
cried
,
as
he
too
bent
over
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
what
he
is
going
to
assist
us
in
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
and
be
*NL*
calm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
allusion
made
me
spring
up
;
though
I
dropped
again
from
the
pain
*NL*
in
my
arm
.
``
The
time
has
not
gone
by
,
Herbert
,
has
it
?
What
night
is
*NL*
to-night
?
How
long
have
I
been
here
?
''
For
,
I
had
a
strange
and
*NL*
strong
misgiving
that
I
had
been
lying
there
a
long
time
--
a
day
and
a
*NL*
night
,
--
two
days
and
nights
,
--
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
has
not
gone
by
.
It
is
still
Monday
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
all
to-morrow
,
Tuesday
,
to
rest
in
,
''
said
Herbert
.
``
But
*NL*
you
ca
n't
help
groaning
,
my
dear
Handel
.
What
hurt
have
you
got
?
Can
you
*NL*
stand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
can
walk
.
I
have
no
hurt
but
in
this
throbbing
*NL*
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
laid
it
bare
,
and
did
what
they
could
.
It
was
violently
swollen
and
*NL*
inflamed
,
and
I
could
scarcely
endure
to
have
it
touched
.
But
,
they
tore
*NL*
up
their
handkerchiefs
to
make
fresh
bandages
,
and
carefully
replaced
*NL*
it
in
the
sling
,
until
we
could
get
to
the
town
and
obtain
some
cooling
*NL*
lotion
to
put
upon
it
.
In
a
little
while
we
had
shut
the
door
of
the
*NL*
dark
and
empty
sluice-house
,
and
were
passing
through
the
quarry
on
our
*NL*
way
back
.
Trabb
's
boy
--
Trabb
's
overgrown
young
man
now
--
went
before
us
*NL*
with
a
lantern
,
which
was
the
light
I
had
seen
come
in
at
the
door
.
But
,
*NL*
the
moon
was
a
good
two
hours
higher
than
when
I
had
last
seen
the
sky
,
*NL*
and
the
night
,
though
rainy
,
was
much
lighter
.
The
white
vapor
of
the
*NL*
kiln
was
passing
from
us
as
we
went
by
,
and
as
I
had
thought
a
prayer
*NL*
before
,
I
thought
a
thanksgiving
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Entreating
Herbert
to
tell
me
how
he
had
come
to
my
rescue
,
--
which
at
*NL*
first
he
had
flatly
refused
to
do
,
but
had
insisted
on
my
remaining
*NL*
quiet
,
--
I
learnt
that
I
had
in
my
hurry
dropped
the
letter
,
open
,
in
our
*NL*
chambers
,
where
he
,
coming
home
to
bring
with
him
Startop
whom
he
had
*NL*
met
in
the
street
on
his
way
to
me
,
found
it
,
very
soon
after
I
*NL*
was
gone
.
Its
tone
made
him
uneasy
,
and
the
more
so
because
of
the
*NL*
inconsistency
between
it
and
the
hasty
letter
I
had
left
for
him
.
His
*NL*
uneasiness
increasing
instead
of
subsiding
,
after
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
's
consideration
,
he
set
off
for
the
coach-office
with
Startop
,
who
*NL*
volunteered
his
company
,
to
make
inquiry
when
the
next
coach
went
*NL*
down
.
Finding
that
the
afternoon
coach
was
gone
,
and
finding
that
his
*NL*
uneasiness
grew
into
positive
alarm
,
as
obstacles
came
in
his
way
,
he
*NL*
resolved
to
follow
in
a
post-chaise
.
So
he
and
Startop
arrived
at
the
*NL*
Blue
Boar
,
fully
expecting
there
to
find
me
,
or
tidings
of
me
;
but
,
*NL*
finding
neither
,
went
on
to
Miss
Havisham
's
,
where
they
lost
me
.
*NL*
Hereupon
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
-LRB-
doubtless
at
about
the
time
when
*NL*
I
was
hearing
the
popular
local
version
of
my
own
story
-RRB-
to
refresh
*NL*
themselves
and
to
get
some
one
to
guide
them
out
upon
the
marshes
.
Among
*NL*
the
loungers
under
the
Boar
's
archway
happened
to
be
Trabb
's
Boy
,
--
true
*NL*
to
his
ancient
habit
of
happening
to
be
everywhere
where
he
had
no
*NL*
business
,
--
and
Trabb
's
boy
had
seen
me
passing
from
Miss
Havisham
's
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
my
dining-place
.
Thus
Trabb
's
boy
became
their
guide
,
*NL*
and
with
him
they
went
out
to
the
sluice-house
,
though
by
the
town
way
*NL*
to
the
marshes
,
which
I
had
avoided
.
Now
,
as
they
went
along
,
Herbert
*NL*
reflected
,
that
I
might
,
after
all
,
have
been
brought
there
on
some
*NL*
genuine
and
serviceable
errand
tending
to
Provis
's
safety
,
and
,
*NL*
bethinking
himself
that
in
that
case
interruption
must
be
mischievous
,
*NL*
left
his
guide
and
Startop
on
the
edge
of
the
quarry
,
and
went
on
by
*NL*
himself
,
and
stole
round
the
house
two
or
three
times
,
endeavouring
to
*NL*
ascertain
whether
all
was
right
within
.
As
he
could
hear
nothing
but
*NL*
indistinct
sounds
of
one
deep
rough
voice
-LRB-
this
was
while
my
mind
was
so
*NL*
busy
-RRB-
,
he
even
at
last
began
to
doubt
whether
I
was
there
,
when
suddenly
*NL*
I
cried
out
loudly
,
and
he
answered
the
cries
,
and
rushed
in
,
closely
*NL*
followed
by
the
other
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
told
Herbert
what
had
passed
within
the
house
,
he
was
for
our
*NL*
immediately
going
before
a
magistrate
in
the
town
,
late
at
night
as
it
*NL*
was
,
and
getting
out
a
warrant
.
But
,
I
had
already
considered
that
such
*NL*
a
course
,
by
detaining
us
there
,
or
binding
us
to
come
back
,
might
*NL*
be
fatal
to
Provis
.
There
was
no
gainsaying
this
difficulty
,
and
we
*NL*
relinquished
all
thoughts
of
pursuing
Orlick
at
that
time
.
For
the
*NL*
present
,
under
the
circumstances
,
we
deemed
it
prudent
to
make
rather
*NL*
light
of
the
matter
to
Trabb
's
boy
;
who
,
I
am
convinced
,
would
have
been
*NL*
much
affected
by
disappointment
,
if
he
had
known
that
his
intervention
*NL*
saved
me
from
the
limekiln
.
Not
that
Trabb
's
boy
was
of
a
malignant
*NL*
nature
,
but
that
he
had
too
much
spare
vivacity
,
and
that
it
was
in
his
*NL*
constitution
to
want
variety
and
excitement
at
anybody
's
expense
.
When
*NL*
we
parted
,
I
presented
him
with
two
guineas
-LRB-
which
seemed
to
meet
his
*NL*
views
-RRB-
,
and
told
him
that
I
was
sorry
ever
to
have
had
an
ill
opinion
of
*NL*
him
-LRB-
which
made
no
impression
on
him
at
all
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wednesday
being
so
close
upon
us
,
we
determined
to
go
back
to
London
*NL*
that
night
,
three
in
the
post-chaise
;
the
rather
,
as
we
should
then
be
*NL*
clear
away
before
the
night
's
adventure
began
to
be
talked
of
.
Herbert
*NL*
got
a
large
bottle
of
stuff
for
my
arm
;
and
by
dint
of
having
this
stuff
*NL*
dropped
over
it
all
the
night
through
,
I
was
just
able
to
bear
its
pain
*NL*
on
the
journey
.
It
was
daylight
when
we
reached
the
Temple
,
and
I
went
*NL*
at
once
to
bed
,
and
lay
in
bed
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
terror
,
as
I
lay
there
,
of
falling
ill
,
and
being
unfitted
for
*NL*
to-morrow
,
was
so
besetting
,
that
I
wonder
it
did
not
disable
me
of
*NL*
itself
.
It
would
have
done
so
,
pretty
surely
,
in
conjunction
with
the
*NL*
mental
wear
and
tear
I
had
suffered
,
but
for
the
unnatural
strain
upon
*NL*
me
that
to-morrow
was
.
So
anxiously
looked
forward
to
,
charged
with
such
*NL*
consequences
,
its
results
so
impenetrably
hidden
,
though
so
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
precaution
could
have
been
more
obvious
than
our
refraining
*NL*
from
communication
with
him
that
day
;
yet
this
again
increased
my
*NL*
restlessness
.
I
started
at
every
footstep
and
every
sound
,
believing
*NL*
that
he
was
discovered
and
taken
,
and
this
was
the
messenger
to
tell
*NL*
me
so
.
I
persuaded
myself
that
I
knew
he
was
taken
;
that
there
was
*NL*
something
more
upon
my
mind
than
a
fear
or
a
presentiment
;
that
the
fact
*NL*
had
occurred
,
and
I
had
a
mysterious
knowledge
of
it
.
As
the
days
wore
*NL*
on
,
and
no
ill
news
came
,
as
the
day
closed
in
and
darkness
fell
,
*NL*
my
overshadowing
dread
of
being
disabled
by
illness
before
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
altogether
mastered
me
.
My
burning
arm
throbbed
,
and
my
burning
*NL*
head
throbbed
,
and
I
fancied
I
was
beginning
to
wander
.
I
counted
up
to
*NL*
high
numbers
,
to
make
sure
of
myself
,
and
repeated
passages
that
I
knew
*NL*
in
prose
and
verse
.
It
happened
sometimes
that
in
the
mere
escape
of
a
*NL*
fatigued
mind
,
I
dozed
for
some
moments
or
forgot
;
then
I
would
say
to
*NL*
myself
with
a
start
,
``
Now
it
has
come
,
and
I
am
turning
delirious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
kept
me
very
quiet
all
day
,
and
kept
my
arm
constantly
dressed
,
and
*NL*
gave
me
cooling
drinks
.
Whenever
I
fell
asleep
,
I
awoke
with
the
notion
*NL*
I
had
had
in
the
sluice-house
,
that
a
long
time
had
elapsed
and
the
*NL*
opportunity
to
save
him
was
gone
.
About
midnight
I
got
out
of
bed
*NL*
and
went
to
Herbert
,
with
the
conviction
that
I
had
been
asleep
for
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
,
and
that
Wednesday
was
past
.
It
was
the
last
*NL*
self-exhausting
effort
of
my
fretfulness
,
for
after
that
I
slept
*NL*
soundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wednesday
morning
was
dawning
when
I
looked
out
of
window
.
The
winking
*NL*
lights
upon
the
bridges
were
already
pale
,
the
coming
sun
was
like
a
*NL*
marsh
of
fire
on
the
horizon
.
The
river
,
still
dark
and
mysterious
,
was
*NL*
spanned
by
bridges
that
were
turning
coldly
gray
,
with
here
and
there
*NL*
at
top
a
warm
touch
from
the
burning
in
the
sky
.
As
I
looked
along
*NL*
the
clustered
roofs
,
with
church-towers
and
spires
shooting
into
the
*NL*
unusually
clear
air
,
the
sun
rose
up
,
and
a
veil
seemed
to
be
drawn
from
*NL*
the
river
,
and
millions
of
sparkles
burst
out
upon
its
waters
.
From
me
*NL*
too
,
a
veil
seemed
to
be
drawn
,
and
I
felt
strong
and
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
lay
asleep
in
his
bed
,
and
our
old
fellow-student
lay
asleep
on
*NL*
the
sofa
.
I
could
not
dress
myself
without
help
;
but
I
made
up
the
fire
,
*NL*
which
was
still
burning
,
and
got
some
coffee
ready
for
them
.
In
good
*NL*
time
they
too
started
up
strong
and
well
,
and
we
admitted
the
sharp
*NL*
morning
air
at
the
windows
,
and
looked
at
the
tide
that
was
still
*NL*
flowing
towards
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
it
turns
at
nine
o'clock
,
''
said
Herbert
,
cheerfully
,
``
look
out
for
*NL*
us
,
and
stand
ready
,
you
over
there
at
Mill
Pond
Bank
!

Chapter
LIV
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
those
March
days
when
the
sun
shines
hot
and
the
wind
*NL*
blows
cold
:
when
it
is
summer
in
the
light
,
and
winter
in
the
shade
.
*NL*
We
had
our
pea-coats
with
us
,
and
I
took
a
bag
.
Of
all
my
worldly
*NL*
possessions
I
took
no
more
than
the
few
necessaries
that
filled
the
*NL*
bag
.
Where
I
might
go
,
what
I
might
do
,
or
when
I
might
return
,
were
*NL*
questions
utterly
unknown
to
me
;
nor
did
I
vex
my
mind
with
them
,
for
*NL*
it
was
wholly
set
on
Provis
's
safety
.
I
only
wondered
for
the
passing
*NL*
moment
,
as
I
stopped
at
the
door
and
looked
back
,
under
what
altered
*NL*
circumstances
I
should
next
see
those
rooms
,
if
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
loitered
down
to
the
Temple
stairs
,
and
stood
loitering
there
,
as
if
*NL*
we
were
not
quite
decided
to
go
upon
the
water
at
all
.
Of
course
,
I
had
*NL*
taken
care
that
the
boat
should
be
ready
and
everything
in
order
.
After
*NL*
a
little
show
of
indecision
,
which
there
were
none
to
see
but
the
two
*NL*
or
three
amphibious
creatures
belonging
to
our
Temple
stairs
,
we
went
*NL*
on
board
and
cast
off
;
Herbert
in
the
bow
,
I
steering
.
It
was
then
about
*NL*
high-water
,
--
half-past
eight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
plan
was
this
.
The
tide
,
beginning
to
run
down
at
nine
,
and
being
*NL*
with
us
until
three
,
we
intended
still
to
creep
on
after
it
had
turned
,
*NL*
and
row
against
it
until
dark
.
We
should
then
be
well
in
those
long
*NL*
reaches
below
Gravesend
,
between
Kent
and
Essex
,
where
the
river
is
*NL*
broad
and
solitary
,
where
the
water-side
inhabitants
are
very
few
,
and
*NL*
where
lone
public-houses
are
scattered
here
and
there
,
of
which
we
could
*NL*
choose
one
for
a
resting-place
.
There
,
we
meant
to
lie
by
all
night
.
*NL*
The
steamer
for
Hamburg
and
the
steamer
for
Rotterdam
would
start
from
*NL*
London
at
about
nine
on
Thursday
morning
.
We
should
know
at
what
time
*NL*
to
expect
them
,
according
to
where
we
were
,
and
would
hail
the
first
;
*NL*
so
that
,
if
by
any
accident
we
were
not
taken
abroad
,
we
should
have
*NL*
another
chance
.
We
knew
the
distinguishing
marks
of
each
vessel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
relief
of
being
at
last
engaged
in
the
execution
of
the
purpose
*NL*
was
so
great
to
me
that
I
felt
it
difficult
to
realize
the
condition
in
*NL*
which
I
had
been
a
few
hours
before
.
The
crisp
air
,
the
sunlight
,
the
*NL*
movement
on
the
river
,
and
the
moving
river
itself
,
--
the
road
that
ran
*NL*
with
us
,
seeming
to
sympathize
with
us
,
animate
us
,
and
encourage
us
*NL*
on
,
--
freshened
me
with
new
hope
.
I
felt
mortified
to
be
of
so
little
use
*NL*
in
the
boat
;
but
,
there
were
few
better
oarsmen
than
my
two
friends
,
and
*NL*
they
rowed
with
a
steady
stroke
that
was
to
last
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
,
the
steam-traffic
on
the
Thames
was
far
below
its
present
*NL*
extent
,
and
watermen
's
boats
were
far
more
numerous
.
Of
barges
,
sailing
*NL*
colliers
,
and
coasting-traders
,
there
were
perhaps
,
as
many
as
now
;
*NL*
but
of
steam-ships
,
great
and
small
,
not
a
tithe
or
a
twentieth
part
*NL*
so
many
.
Early
as
it
was
,
there
were
plenty
of
scullers
going
here
and
*NL*
there
that
morning
,
and
plenty
of
barges
dropping
down
with
the
tide
;
*NL*
the
navigation
of
the
river
between
bridges
,
in
an
open
boat
,
was
a
much
*NL*
easier
and
commoner
matter
in
those
days
than
it
is
in
these
;
and
we
*NL*
went
ahead
among
many
skiffs
and
wherries
briskly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
London
Bridge
was
soon
passed
,
and
old
Billingsgate
Market
with
its
*NL*
oyster-boats
and
Dutchmen
,
and
the
White
Tower
and
Traitor
's
Gate
,
and
*NL*
we
were
in
among
the
tiers
of
shipping
.
Here
were
the
Leith
,
Aberdeen
,
*NL*
and
Glasgow
steamers
,
loading
and
unloading
goods
,
and
looking
immensely
*NL*
high
out
of
the
water
as
we
passed
alongside
;
here
,
were
colliers
by
the
*NL*
score
and
score
,
with
the
coal-whippers
plunging
off
stages
on
deck
,
as
*NL*
counterweights
to
measures
of
coal
swinging
up
,
which
were
then
rattled
*NL*
over
the
side
into
barges
;
here
,
at
her
moorings
was
to-morrow
's
steamer
*NL*
for
Rotterdam
,
of
which
we
took
good
notice
;
and
here
to-morrow
's
for
*NL*
Hamburg
,
under
whose
bowsprit
we
crossed
.
And
now
I
,
sitting
in
the
*NL*
stern
,
could
see
,
with
a
faster
beating
heart
,
Mill
Pond
Bank
and
Mill
*NL*
Pond
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
there
?
''
said
Herbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
!
He
was
not
to
come
down
till
he
saw
us
.
Can
you
see
his
signal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
well
from
here
;
but
I
think
I
see
it
.
--
Now
I
see
him
!
Pull
both
.
*NL*
Easy
,
Herbert
.
Oars
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
touched
the
stairs
lightly
for
a
single
moment
,
and
he
was
on
board
,
*NL*
and
we
were
off
again
.
He
had
a
boat-cloak
with
him
,
and
a
black
canvas
*NL*
bag
;
and
he
looked
as
like
a
river-pilot
as
my
heart
could
have
wished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
boy
!
''
he
said
,
putting
his
arm
on
my
shoulder
,
as
he
took
his
*NL*
seat
.
``
Faithful
dear
boy
,
well
done
.
Thankye
,
thankye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
among
the
tiers
of
shipping
,
in
and
out
,
avoiding
rusty
*NL*
chain-cables
frayed
hempen
hawsers
and
bobbing
buoys

sinking
for
the

moment
floating
broken

scattering
floating

of

*NL*
and

,
cleaving
floating
scum
of
coal
,
in
and
out
,
under
the
*NL*
figure-head
of
the
John
of
Sunderland
making
a
speech
to
the
winds
-LRB-
as
*NL*
is
done
by
many
Johns
-RRB-
,
and
the
Betsy
of
Yarmouth
with
a
firm
formality
*NL*
of
bosom
and
her
knobby
eyes
starting
two
inches
out
of
her
head
;
in
*NL*
and
out
,
hammers
going
in
ship-builders
'
yards
,

*NL*
clashing

going
at

unknown
,

going

leaky

,
*NL*

going
,

,
and
unintelligible
sea-creatures
*NL*
roaring
curses
over
the
bulwarks
at
respondent
lightermen
,
in
and
*NL*
out
,
--
out
at
last
upon
the
clearer
river
,
where
the
ships
'
boys
might
*NL*
take
their
fenders
in
,
no
longer
fishing
in
troubled
waters
with
them
*NL*
over
the
side
,
and
where
the
festooned
sails
might
fly
out
to
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
stairs
where
we
had
taken
him
abroad
,
and
ever
since
,
I
had
*NL*
looked
warily
for
any
token
of
our
being
suspected
.
I
had
seen
none
.
We
*NL*
certainly
had
not
been
,
and
at
that
time
as
certainly
we
were
not
either
*NL*
attended
or
followed
by
any
boat
.
If
we
had
been
waited
on
by
any
boat
,
*NL*
I
should
have
run
in
to
shore
,
and
have
obliged
her
to
go
on
,
or
to
*NL*
make
her
purpose
evident
.
But
we
held
our
own
without
any
appearance
of
*NL*
molestation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
his
boat-cloak
on
him
,
and
looked
,
as
I
have
said
,
a
natural
part
*NL*
of
the
scene
.
It
was
remarkable
-LRB-
but
perhaps
the
wretched
life
he
had
*NL*
led
accounted
for
it
-RRB-
that
he
was
the
least
anxious
of
any
of
us
.
He
*NL*
was
not
indifferent
,
for
he
told
me
that
he
hoped
to
live
to
see
his
*NL*
gentleman
one
of
the
best
of
gentlemen
in
a
foreign
country
;
he
was
not
*NL*
disposed
to
be
passive
or
resigned
,
as
I
understood
it
;
but
he
had
no
*NL*
notion
of
meeting
danger
half
way
.
When
it
came
upon
him
,
he
confronted
*NL*
it
,
but
it
must
come
before
he
troubled
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
knowed
,
dear
boy
,
''
he
said
to
me
,
``
what
it
is
to
sit
here
*NL*
alonger
my
dear
boy
and
have
my
smoke
,
arter
having
been
day
by
day
*NL*
betwixt
four
walls
,
you
'd
envy
me
.
But
you
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
know
the
delights
of
freedom
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
he
,
shaking
his
head
gravely
.
``
But
you
do
n't
know
it
equal
to
*NL*
me
.
You
must
have
been
under
lock
and
key
,
dear
boy
,
to
know
it
equal
to
*NL*
me
,
--
but
I
ai
n't
a
going
to
be
low
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
occurred
to
me
as
inconsistent
,
that
,
for
any
mastering
idea
,
he
*NL*
should
have
endangered
his
freedom
,
and
even
his
life
.
But
I
reflected
*NL*
that
perhaps
freedom
without
danger
was
too
much
apart
from
all
the
*NL*
habit
of
his
existence
to
be
to
him
what
it
would
be
to
another
man
.
I
*NL*
was
not
far
out
,
since
he
said
,
after
smoking
a
little
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
dear
boy
,
when
I
was
over
yonder
,
t
`
other
side
the
world
,
I
*NL*
was
always
a
looking
to
this
side
;
and
it
come
flat
to
be
there
,
for
*NL*
all
I
was
a
growing
rich
.
Everybody
knowed
Magwitch
,
and
Magwitch
could
*NL*
come
,
and
Magwitch
could
go
,
and
nobody
's
head
would
be
troubled
about
*NL*
him
.
They
ai
n't
so
easy
concerning
me
here
,
dear
boy
,
--
would
n't
be
,
*NL*
leastwise
,
if
they
knowed
where
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
all
goes
well
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
will
be
perfectly
free
and
safe
again
*NL*
within
a
few
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
returned
,
drawing
a
long
breath
,
``
I
hope
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dipped
his
hand
in
the
water
over
the
boat
's
gunwale
,
and
said
,
*NL*
smiling
with
that
softened
air
upon
him
which
was
not
new
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
I
s
`
pose
I
think
so
,
dear
boy
.
We
'd
be
puzzled
to
be
more
quiet
*NL*
and
easy-going
than
we
are
at
present
.
But
--
it
's
a
flowing
so
soft
*NL*
and
pleasant
through
the
water
,
p
`
raps
,
as
makes
me
think
it
--
I
was
*NL*
a
thinking
through
my
smoke
just
then
,
that
we
can
no
more
see
to
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
next
few
hours
than
we
can
see
to
the
bottom
of
this
river
*NL*
what
I
catches
hold
of
.
Nor
yet
we
ca
n't
no
more
hold
their
tide
than
*NL*
I
can
hold
this
.
And
it
's
run
through
my
fingers
and
gone
,
you
see
!
''
*NL*
holding
up
his
dripping
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
your
face
I
should
think
you
were
a
little
despondent
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
on
it
,
dear
boy
!
It
comes
of
flowing
on
so
quiet
,
and
of
that
*NL*
there
rippling
at
the
boat
's
head
making
a
sort
of
a
Sunday
tune
.
Maybe
*NL*
I
'm
a
growing
a
trifle
old
besides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
pipe
back
in
his
mouth
with
an
undisturbed
expression
of
*NL*
face
,
and
sat
as
composed
and
contented
as
if
we
were
already
out
of
*NL*
England
.
Yet
he
was
as
submissive
to
a
word
of
advice
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
in
constant
terror
;
for
,
when
we
ran
ashore
to
get
some
bottles
of
beer
*NL*
into
the
boat
,
and
he
was
stepping
out
,
I
hinted
that
I
thought
he
would
*NL*
be
safest
where
he
was
,
and
he
said
.
``
Do
you
,
dear
boy
?
''
and
quietly
sat
*NL*
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
felt
cold
upon
the
river
,
but
it
was
a
bright
day
,
and
the
*NL*
sunshine
was
very
cheering
.
The
tide
ran
strong
,
I
took
care
to
lose
*NL*
none
of
it
,
and
our
steady
stroke
carried
us
on
thoroughly
well
.
By
*NL*
imperceptible
degrees
,
as
the
tide
ran
out
,
we
lost
more
and
more
of
the
*NL*
nearer
woods
and
hills
,
and
dropped
lower
and
lower
between
the
muddy
*NL*
banks
,
but
the
tide
was
yet
with
us
when
we
were
off
Gravesend
.
As
our
*NL*
charge
was
wrapped
in
his
cloak
,
I
purposely
passed
within
a
boat
or
*NL*
two
's
length
of
the
floating
Custom
House
,
and
so
out
to
catch
the
*NL*
stream
,
alongside
of
two
emigrant
ships
,
and
under
the
bows
of
a
large
*NL*
transport
with
troops
on
the
forecastle
looking
down
at
us
.
And
soon
*NL*
the
tide
began
to
slacken
,
and
the
craft
lying
at
anchor
to
swing
,
*NL*
and
presently
they
had
all
swung
round
,
and
the
ships
that
were
taking
*NL*
advantage
of
the
new
tide
to
get
up
to
the
Pool
began
to
crowd
upon
us
*NL*
in
a
fleet
,
and
we
kept
under
the
shore
,
as
much
out
of
the
strength
of
*NL*
the
tide
now
as
we
could
,
standing
carefully
off
from
low
shallows
and
*NL*
mudbanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
oarsmen
were
so
fresh
,
by
dint
of
having
occasionally
let
her
drive
*NL*
with
the
tide
for
a
minute
or
two
,
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
rest
*NL*
proved
full
as
much
as
they
wanted
.
We
got
ashore
among
some
slippery
*NL*
stones
while
we
ate
and
drank
what
we
had
with
us
,
and
looked
about
.
*NL*
It
was
like
my
own
marsh
country
,
flat
and
monotonous
,
and
with
a
*NL*
dim
horizon
;
while
the
winding
river
turned
and
turned
,
and
the
great
*NL*
floating
buoys
upon
it
turned
and
turned
,
and
everything
else
seemed
*NL*
stranded
and
still
.
For
now
the
last
of
the
fleet
of
ships
was
round
*NL*
the
last
low
point
we
had
headed
;
and
the
last
green
barge
,
straw-laden
,
*NL*
with
a
brown
sail
,
had
followed
;
and
some
ballast-lighters
,
shaped
like
*NL*
a
child
's
first
rude
imitation
of
a
boat
,
lay
low
in
the
mud
;
and
a
*NL*
little
squat
shoal-lighthouse
on
open
piles
stood
crippled
in
the
mud
*NL*
on
stilts
and
crutches
;
and
slimy
stakes
stuck
out
of
the
mud
,
and
slimy
*NL*
stones
stuck
out
of
the
mud
,
and
red
landmarks
and
tidemarks
stuck
*NL*
out
of
the
mud
,
and
an
old
landing-stage
and
an
old
roofless
building
*NL*
slipped
into
the
mud
,
and
all
about
us
was
stagnation
and
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
pushed
off
again
,
and
made
what
way
we
could
.
It
was
much
harder
work
*NL*
now
,
but
Herbert
and
Startop
persevered
,
and
rowed
and
rowed
and
rowed
*NL*
until
the
sun
went
down
.
By
that
time
the
river
had
lifted
us
a
little
,
*NL*
so
that
we
could
see
above
the
bank
.
There
was
the
red
sun
,
on
the
low
*NL*
level
of
the
shore
,
in
a
purple
haze
,
fast
deepening
into
black
;
and
*NL*
there
was
the
solitary
flat
marsh
;
and
far
away
there
were
the
rising
*NL*
grounds
,
between
which
and
us
there
seemed
to
be
no
life
,
save
here
and
*NL*
there
in
the
foreground
a
melancholy
gull
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
night
was
fast
falling
,
and
as
the
moon
,
being
past
the
full
,
*NL*
would
not
rise
early
,
we
held
a
little
council
;
a
short
one
,
for
clearly
*NL*
our
course
was
to
lie
by
at
the
first
lonely
tavern
we
could
find
.
So
,
*NL*
they
plied
their
oars
once
more
,
and
I
looked
out
for
anything
like
a
*NL*
house
.
Thus
we
held
on
,
speaking
little
,
for
four
or
five
dull
miles
.
It
*NL*
was
very
cold
,
and
,
a
collier
coming
by
us
,
with
her
galley-fire
smoking
*NL*
and
flaring
,
looked
like
a
comfortable
home
.
The
night
was
as
dark
by
*NL*
this
time
as
it
would
be
until
morning
;
and
what
light
we
had
,
seemed
*NL*
to
come
more
from
the
river
than
the
sky
,
as
the
oars
in
their
dipping
*NL*
struck
at
a
few
reflected
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
dismal
time
we
were
evidently
all
possessed
by
the
idea
that
*NL*
we
were
followed
.
As
the
tide
made
,
it
flapped
heavily
at
irregular
*NL*
intervals
against
the
shore
;
and
whenever
such
a
sound
came
,
one
or
*NL*
other
of
us
was
sure
to
start
,
and
look
in
that
direction
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
,
the
set
of
the
current
had
worn
down
the
bank
into
a
little
*NL*
creek
,
and
we
were
all
suspicious
of
such
places
,
and
eyed
them
*NL*
nervously
.
Sometimes
,
``
What
was
that
ripple
?
''
one
of
us
would
say
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
.
Or
another
,
``
Is
that
a
boat
yonder
?
''
And
afterwards
we
would
*NL*
fall
into
a
dead
silence
,
and
I
would
sit
impatiently
thinking
with
what
*NL*
an
unusual
amount
of
noise
the
oars
worked
in
the
thowels
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
we
descried
a
light
and
a
roof
,
and
presently
afterwards
ran
*NL*
alongside
a
little
causeway
made
of
stones
that
had
been
picked
up
hard
*NL*
by
.
Leaving
the
rest
in
the
boat
,
I
stepped
ashore
,
and
found
the
light
*NL*
to
be
in
a
window
of
a
public-house
.
It
was
a
dirty
place
enough
,
and
I
*NL*
dare
say
not
unknown
to
smuggling
adventurers
;
but
there
was
a
good
*NL*
fire
in
the
kitchen
,
and
there
were
eggs
and
bacon
to
eat
,
and
various
*NL*
liquors
to
drink
.
Also
,
there
were
two
double-bedded
rooms
,
--
``
such
as
*NL*
they
were
,
''
the
landlord
said
.
No
other
company
was
in
the
house
than
*NL*
the
landlord
,
his
wife
,
and
a
grizzled
male
creature
,
the
``
Jack
''
of
the
*NL*
little
causeway
,
who
was
as
slimy
and
smeary
as
if
he
had
been
low-water
*NL*
mark
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
assistant
,
I
went
down
to
the
boat
again
,
and
we
all
came
*NL*
ashore
,
and
brought
out
the
oars
,
and
rudder
and
boat-hook
,
and
all
*NL*
else
,
and
hauled
her
up
for
the
night
.
We
made
a
very
good
meal
by
the
*NL*
kitchen
fire
,
and
then
apportioned
the
bedrooms
:
Herbert
and
Startop
*NL*
were
to
occupy
one
;
I
and
our
charge
the
other
.
We
found
the
air
as
*NL*
carefully
excluded
from
both
,
as
if
air
were
fatal
to
life
;
and
there
*NL*
were
more
dirty
clothes
and
bandboxes
under
the
beds
than
I
should
have
*NL*
thought
the
family
possessed
.
But
we
considered
ourselves
well
off
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
,
for
a
more
solitary
place
we
could
not
have
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
comforting
ourselves
by
the
fire
after
our
meal
,
the
*NL*
Jack
--
who
was
sitting
in
a
corner
,
and
who
had
a
bloated
pair
of
shoes
*NL*
on
,
which
he
had
exhibited
while
we
were
eating
our
eggs
and
bacon
,
as
*NL*
interesting
relics
that
he
had
taken
a
few
days
ago
from
the
feet
of
*NL*
a
drowned
seaman
washed
ashore
--
asked
me
if
we
had
seen
a
four-oared
*NL*
galley
going
up
with
the
tide
?
When
I
told
him
No
,
he
said
she
must
have
*NL*
gone
down
then
,
and
yet
she
``
took
up
too
,
''
when
she
left
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
must
ha
'
thought
better
o
n't
for
some
reason
or
another
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Jack
,
``
and
gone
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
four-oared
galley
,
did
you

I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
four
,
''
said
the
Jack
,
``
and
two
sitters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
they
come
ashore
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
put
in
with
a
stone
two-gallon
jar
for
some
beer
.
I
'd
ha

been
*NL*
glad
to
pison
the
beer
myself
,
''
said
the
Jack
,
``
or
put
some
rattling
*NL*
physic
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
why
,
''
said
the
Jack
.
He
spoke
in
a
slushy
voice
,
as
if
much
mud
*NL*
had
washed
into
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
a
weakly
meditative
man
with
a
pale
eye
,
*NL*
who
seemed
to
rely
greatly
on
his
Jack
,
--
``
he
thinks
they
was
,
what
they
*NL*
was
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knows
what
I
thinks
,
''
observed
the
Jack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thinks
Custum
`
Us
,
Jack
?
''
said
the
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
said
the
Jack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
're
wrong
,
Jack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
AM
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
infinite
meaning
of
his
reply
and
his
boundless
confidence
in
*NL*
his
views
,
the
Jack
took
one
of
his
bloated
shoes
off
,
looked
into
*NL*
it
,
knocked
a
few
stones
out
of
it
on
the
kitchen
floor
,
and
put
it
on
*NL*
again
.
He
did
this
with
the
air
of
a
Jack
who
was
so
right
that
he
could
*NL*
afford
to
do
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
do
you
make
out
that
they
done
with
their
buttons
then
,
*NL*
Jack
?
''
asked
the
landlord
,
vacillating
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
with
their
buttons
?
''
returned
the
Jack
.
``
Chucked
'em
overboard
.
*NL*
Swallered
'em
.
Sowed
'em
,
to
come
up
small
salad
.
Done
with
their
*NL*
buttons
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
cheeky
,
Jack
,
''
remonstrated
the
landlord
,
in
a
melancholy
and
*NL*
pathetic
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Custum
`
Us
officer
knows
what
to
do
with
his
Buttons
,
''
said
the
Jack
,
*NL*
repeating
the
obnoxious
word
with
the
greatest
contempt
,
``
when
they
*NL*
comes
betwixt
him
and
his
own
light
.
A
four
and
two
sitters
do
n't
go
*NL*
hanging
and
hovering
,
up
with
one
tide
and
down
with
another
,
and
both
*NL*
with
and
against
another
,
without
there
being
Custum
`
Us
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
it
.
''
Saying
which
he
went
out
in
disdain
;
and
the
landlord
,
having
no
*NL*
one
to
reply
upon
,
found
it
impracticable
to
pursue
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dialogue
made
us
all
uneasy
,
and
me
very
uneasy
.
The
dismal
wind
*NL*
was
muttering
round
the
house
,
the
tide
was
flapping
at
the
shore
,
and
*NL*
I
had
a
feeling
that
we
were
caged
and
threatened
.
A
four-oared
galley
*NL*
hovering
about
in
so
unusual
a
way
as
to
attract
this
notice
was
an
ugly
*NL*
circumstance
that
I
could
not
get
rid
of
.
When
I
had
induced
Provis
to
*NL*
go
up
to
bed
,
I
went
outside
with
my
two
companions
-LRB-
Startop
by
this
*NL*
time
knew
the
state
of
the
case
-RRB-
,
and
held
another
council
.
Whether
we
*NL*
should
remain
at
the
house
until
near
the
steamer
's
time
,
which
would
*NL*
be
about
one
in
the
afternoon
,
or
whether
we
should
put
off
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
was
the
question
we
discussed
.
On
the
whole
we
deemed
it
the
*NL*
better
course
to
lie
where
we
were
,
until
within
an
hour
or
so
of
the
*NL*
steamer
's
time
,
and
then
to
get
out
in
her
track
,
and
drift
easily
with
*NL*
the
tide
.
Having
settled
to
do
this
,
we
returned
into
the
house
and
went
*NL*
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
down
with
the
greater
part
of
my
clothes
on
,
and
slept
well
for
a
*NL*
few
hours
.
When
I
awoke
,
the
wind
had
risen
,
and
the
sign
of
the
house
*NL*
-LRB-
the
Ship
-RRB-
was
creaking
and
banging
about
,
with
noises
that
startled
*NL*
me
.
Rising
softly
,
for
my
charge
lay
fast
asleep
,
I
looked
out
of
the
*NL*
window
.
It
commanded
the
causeway
where
we
had
hauled
up
our
boat
,
and
,
*NL*
as
my
eyes
adapted
themselves
to
the
light
of
the
clouded
moon
,
I
saw
*NL*
two
men
looking
into
her
.
They
passed
by
under
the
window
,
looking
at
*NL*
nothing
else
,
and
they
did
not
go
down
to
the
landing-place
which
I
*NL*
could
discern
to
be
empty
,
but
struck
across
the
marsh
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
the
Nore
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
impulse
was
to
call
up
Herbert
,
and
show
him
the
two
men
going
*NL*
away
.
But
reflecting
,
before
I
got
into
his
room
,
which
was
at
the
back
*NL*
of
the
house
and
adjoined
mine
,
that
he
and
Startop
had
had
a
harder
day
*NL*
than
I
,
and
were
fatigued
,
I
forbore
.
Going
back
to
my
window
,
I
could
*NL*
see
the
two
men
moving
over
the
marsh
.
In
that
light
,
however
,
I
soon
*NL*
lost
them
,
and
,
feeling
very
cold
,
lay
down
to
think
of
the
matter
,
and
*NL*
fell
asleep
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
up
early
.
As
we
walked
to
and
fro
,
all
four
together
,
before
*NL*
breakfast
,
I
deemed
it
right
to
recount
what
I
had
seen
.
Again
our
*NL*
charge
was
the
least
anxious
of
the
party
.
It
was
very
likely
that
the
*NL*
men
belonged
to
the
Custom
House
,
he
said
quietly
,
and
that
they
had
no
*NL*
thought
of
us
.
I
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
it
was
so
,
--
as
,
indeed
,
*NL*
it
might
easily
be
.
However
,
I
proposed
that
he
and
I
should
walk
away
*NL*
together
to
a
distant
point
we
could
see
,
and
that
the
boat
should
take
*NL*
us
aboard
there
,
or
as
near
there
as
might
prove
feasible
,
at
about
*NL*
noon
.
This
being
considered
a
good
precaution
,
soon
after
breakfast
he
*NL*
and
I
set
forth
,
without
saying
anything
at
the
tavern
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smoked
his
pipe
as
we
went
along
,
and
sometimes
stopped
to
clap
me
on
*NL*
the
shoulder
.
One
would
have
supposed
that
it
was
I
who
was
in
danger
,
*NL*
not
he
,
and
that
he
was
reassuring
me
.
We
spoke
very
little
.
As
we
*NL*
approached
the
point
,
I
begged
him
to
remain
in
a
sheltered
place
,
while
*NL*
I
went
on
to
reconnoitre
;
for
it
was
towards
it
that
the
men
had
passed
*NL*
in
the
night
.
He
complied
,
and
I
went
on
alone
.
There
was
no
boat
off
*NL*
the
point
,
nor
any
boat
drawn
up
anywhere
near
it
,
nor
were
there
any
*NL*
signs
of
the
men
having
embarked
there
.
But
,
to
be
sure
,
the
tide
was
*NL*
high
,
and
there
might
have
been
some
footpints
under
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
looked
out
from
his
shelter
in
the
distance
,
and
saw
that
I
*NL*
waved
my
hat
to
him
to
come
up
,
he
rejoined
me
,
and
there
we
waited
;
*NL*
sometimes
lying
on
the
bank
,
wrapped
in
our
coats
,
and
sometimes
moving
*NL*
about
to
warm
ourselves
,
until
we
saw
our
boat
coming
round
.
We
got
*NL*
aboard
easily
,
and
rowed
out
into
the
track
of
the
steamer
.
By
that
time
*NL*
it
wanted
but
ten
minutes
of
one
o'clock
,
and
we
began
to
look
out
for
*NL*
her
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
it
was
half-past
one
before
we
saw
her
smoke
,
and
soon
afterwards
*NL*
we
saw
behind
it
the
smoke
of
another
steamer
.
As
they
were
coming
on
*NL*
at
full
speed
,
we
got
the
two
bags
ready
,
and
took
that
opportunity
*NL*
of
saying
good-bye
to
Herbert
and
Startop
.
We
had
all
shaken
hands
*NL*
cordially
,
and
neither
Herbert
's
eyes
nor
mine
were
quite
dry
,
when
I
*NL*
saw
a
four-oared
galley
shoot
out
from
under
the
bank
but
a
little
way
*NL*
ahead
of
us
,
and
row
out
into
the
same
track
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stretch
of
shore
had
been
as
yet
between
us
and
the
steamer
's
smoke
,
*NL*
by
reason
of
the
bend
and
wind
of
the
river
;
but
now
she
was
visible
,
*NL*
coming
head
on
.
I
called
to
Herbert
and
Startop
to
keep
before
the
tide
,
*NL*
that
she
might
see
us
lying
by
for
her
,
and
I
adjured
Provis
to
sit
*NL*
quite
still
,
wrapped
in
his
cloak
.
He
answered
cheerily
,
``
Trust
to
me
,
*NL*
dear
boy
,
''
and
sat
like
a
statue
.
Meantime
the
galley
,
which
was
very
*NL*
skilfully
handled
,
had
crossed
us
,
let
us
come
up
with
her
,
and
fallen
*NL*
alongside
.
Leaving
just
room
enough
for
the
play
of
the
oars
,
she
kept
*NL*
alongside
,
drifting
when
we
drifted
,
and
pulling
a
stroke
or
two
when
we
*NL*
pulled
.
Of
the
two
sitters
one
held
the
rudder-lines
,
and
looked
at
us
*NL*
attentively
,
--
as
did
all
the
rowers
;
the
other
sitter
was
wrapped
up
,
*NL*
much
as
Provis
was
,
and
seemed
to
shrink
,
and
whisper
some
instruction
*NL*
to
the
steerer
as
he
looked
at
us
.
Not
a
word
was
spoken
in
either
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Startop
could
make
out
,
after
a
few
minutes
,
which
steamer
was
first
,
*NL*
and
gave
me
the
word
``
Hamburg
,
''
in
a
low
voice
,
as
we
sat
face
to
face
.
*NL*
She
was
nearing
us
very
fast
,
and
the
beating
of
her
peddles
grew
louder
*NL*
and
louder
.
I
felt
as
if
her
shadow
were
absolutely
upon
us
,
when
the
*NL*
galley
hailed
us
.
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
returned
Transport
there
,
''
said
the
man
who
held
the
lines
.
*NL*
``
That
's
the
man
,
wrapped
in
the
cloak
.
His
name
is
Abel
Magwitch
,
*NL*
otherwise
Provis
.
I
apprehend
that
man
,
and
call
upon
him
to
surrender
,
*NL*
and
you
to
assist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
,
without
giving
any
audible
direction
to
his
crew
,
*NL*
he
ran
the
galley
abroad
of
us
.
They
had
pulled
one
sudden
stroke
ahead
,
*NL*
had
got
their
oars
in
,
had
run
athwart
us
,
and
were
holding
on
to
*NL*
our
gunwale
,
before
we
knew
what
they
were
doing
.
This
caused
great
*NL*
confusion
on
board
the
steamer
,
and
I
heard
them
calling
to
us
,
and
*NL*
heard
the
order
given
to
stop
the
paddles
,
and
heard
them
stop
,
but
felt
*NL*
her
driving
down
upon
us
irresistibly
.
In
the
same
moment
,
I
saw
the
*NL*
steersman
of
the
galley
lay
his
hand
on
his
prisoner
's
shoulder
,
and
saw
*NL*
that
both
boats
were
swinging
round
with
the
force
of
the
tide
,
and
*NL*
saw
that
all
hands
on
board
the
steamer
were
running
forward
quite
*NL*
frantically
.
Still
,
in
the
same
moment
,
I
saw
the
prisoner
start
*NL*
up
,
lean
across
his
captor
,
and
pull
the
cloak
from
the
neck
of
the
*NL*
shrinking
sitter
in
the
galley
.
Still
in
the
same
moment
,
I
saw
that
the
*NL*
face
disclosed
,
was
the
face
of
the
other
convict
of
long
ago
.
Still
,
in
*NL*
the
same
moment
,
I
saw
the
face
tilt
backward
with
a
white
terror
on
it
*NL*
that
I
shall
never
forget
,
and
heard
a
great
cry
on
board
the
steamer
,
*NL*
and
a
loud
splash
in
the
water
,
and
felt
the
boat
sink
from
under
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
but
for
an
instant
that
I
seemed
to
struggle
with
a
thousand
*NL*
mill-weirs
and
a
thousand
flashes
of
light
;
that
instant
past
,
I
was
*NL*
taken
on
board
the
galley
.
Herbert
was
there
,
and
Startop
was
there
;
but
*NL*
our
boat
was
gone
,
and
the
two
convicts
were
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
with
the
cries
aboard
the
steamer
,
and
the
furious
blowing
off
of
*NL*
her
steam
,
and
her
driving
on
,
and
our
driving
on
,
I
could
not
at
first
*NL*
distinguish
sky
from
water
or
shore
from
shore
;
but
the
crew
of
the
*NL*
galley
righted
her
with
great
speed
,
and
,
pulling
certain
swift
strong
*NL*
strokes
ahead
,
lay
upon
their
oars
,
every
man
looking
silently
and
*NL*
eagerly
at
the
water
astern
.
Presently
a
dark
object
was
seen
in
it
,
*NL*
bearing
towards
us
on
the
tide
.
No
man
spoke
,
but
the
steersman
held
up
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
all
softly
backed
water
,
and
kept
the
boat
straight
and
*NL*
true
before
it
.
As
it
came
nearer
,
I
saw
it
to
be
Magwitch
,
swimming
,
*NL*
but
not
swimming
freely
.
He
was
taken
on
board
,
and
instantly
manacled
*NL*
at
the
wrists
and
ankles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
galley
was
kept
steady
,
and
the
silent
,
eager
look-out
at
the
water
*NL*
was
resumed
.
But
,
the
Rotterdam
steamer
now
came
up
,
and
apparently
not
*NL*
understanding
what
had
happened
,
came
on
at
speed
.
By
the
time
she
had
*NL*
been
hailed
and
stopped
,
both
steamers
were
drifting
away
from
us
,
and
*NL*
we
were
rising
and
falling
in
a
troubled
wake
of
water
.
The
look-out
was
*NL*
kept
,
long
after
all
was
still
again
and
the
two
steamers
were
gone
;
but
*NL*
everybody
knew
that
it
was
hopeless
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
we
gave
it
up
,
and
pulled
under
the
shore
towards
the
tavern
*NL*
we
had
lately
left
,
where
we
were
received
with
no
little
surprise
.
Here
*NL*
I
was
able
to
get
some
comforts
for
Magwitch
,
--
Provis
no
longer
,
--
who
*NL*
had
received
some
very
severe
injury
in
the
Chest
,
and
a
deep
cut
in
the
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
that
he
believed
himself
to
have
gone
under
the
keel
of
the
*NL*
steamer
,
and
to
have
been
struck
on
the
head
in
rising
.
The
injury
to
*NL*
his
chest
-LRB-
which
rendered
his
breathing
extremely
painful
-RRB-
he
thought
*NL*
he
had
received
against
the
side
of
the
galley
.
He
added
that
he
did
not
*NL*
pretend
to
say
what
he
might
or
might
not
have
done
to
Compeyson
,
but
*NL*
that
,
in
the
moment
of
his
laying
his
hand
on
his
cloak
to
identify
him
,
*NL*
that
villain
had
staggered
up
and
staggered
back
,
and
they
had
both
gone
*NL*
overboard
together
,
when
the
sudden
wrenching
of
him
-LRB-
Magwitch
-RRB-
out
of
*NL*
our
boat
,
and
the
endeavor
of
his
captor
to
keep
him
in
it
,
had
capsized
*NL*
us
.
He
told
me
in
a
whisper
that
they
had
gone
down
fiercely
locked
in
*NL*
each
other
's
arms
,
and
that
there
had
been
a
struggle
under
water
,
and
*NL*
that
he
had
disengaged
himself
,
struck
out
,
and
swum
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
had
any
reason
to
doubt
the
exact
truth
of
what
he
thus
told
me
.
*NL*
The
officer
who
steered
the
galley
gave
the
same
account
of
their
going
*NL*
overboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
asked
this
officer
's
permission
to
change
the
prisoner
's
*NL*
wet
clothes
by
purchasing
any
spare
garments
I
could
get
at
the
*NL*
public-house
,
he
gave
it
readily
:
merely
observing
that
he
must
take
*NL*
charge
of
everything
his
prisoner
had
about
him
.
So
the
pocket-book
*NL*
which
had
once
been
in
my
hands
passed
into
the
officer
's
.
He
further
*NL*
gave
me
leave
to
accompany
the
prisoner
to
London
;
but
declined
to
*NL*
accord
that
grace
to
my
two
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jack
at
the
Ship
was
instructed
where
the
drowned
man
had
gone
*NL*
down
,
and
undertook
to
search
for
the
body
in
the
places
where
it
was
*NL*
likeliest
to
come
ashore
.
His
interest
in
its
recovery
seemed
to
me
to
*NL*
be
much
heightened
when
he
heard
that
it
had
stockings
on
.
Probably
,
it
*NL*
took
about
a
dozen
drowned
men
to
fit
him
out
completely
;
and
that
may
*NL*
have
been
the
reason
why
the
different
articles
of
his
dress
were
in
*NL*
various
stages
of
decay
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
remained
at
the
public-house
until
the
tide
turned
,
and
then
Magwitch
*NL*
was
carried
down
to
the
galley
and
put
on
board
.
Herbert
and
Startop
*NL*
were
to
get
to
London
by
land
,
as
soon
as
they
could
.
We
had
a
doleful
*NL*
parting
,
and
when
I
took
my
place
by
Magwitch
's
side
,
I
felt
that
that
*NL*
was
my
place
henceforth
while
he
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
now
,
my
repugnance
to
him
had
all
melted
away
;
and
in
the
hunted
,
*NL*
wounded
,
shackled
creature
who
held
my
hand
in
his
,
I
only
saw
a
man
*NL*
who
had
meant
to
be
my
benefactor
,
and
who
had
felt
affectionately
,
*NL*
gratefully
,
and
generously
,
towards
me
with
great
constancy
through
a
*NL*
series
of
years
.
I
only
saw
in
him
a
much
better
man
than
I
had
been
to
*NL*
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
breathing
became
more
difficult
and
painful
as
the
night
drew
on
,
*NL*
and
often
he
could
not
repress
a
groan
.
I
tried
to
rest
him
on
the
arm
*NL*
I
could
use
,
in
any
easy
position
;
but
it
was
dreadful
to
think
that
*NL*
I
could
not
be
sorry
at
heart
for
his
being
badly
hurt
,
since
it
was
*NL*
unquestionably
best
that
he
should
die
.
That
there
were
,
still
living
,
*NL*
people
enough
who
were
able
and
willing
to
identify
him
,
I
could
not
*NL*
doubt
.
That
he
would
be
leniently
treated
,
I
could
not
hope
.
He
who
had
*NL*
been
presented
in
the
worst
light
at
his
trial
,
who
had
since
broken
*NL*
prison
and
had
been
tried
again
,
who
had
returned
from
transportation
*NL*
under
a
life
sentence
,
and
who
had
occasioned
the
death
of
the
man
who
*NL*
was
the
cause
of
his
arrest
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
returned
towards
the
setting
sun
we
had
yesterday
left
behind
us
,
*NL*
and
as
the
stream
of
our
hopes
seemed
all
running
back
,
I
told
him
how
*NL*
grieved
I
was
to
think
that
he
had
come
home
for
my
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
boy
,
''
he
answered
,
``
I
'm
quite
content
to
take
my
chance
.
I
've
seen
*NL*
my
boy
,
and
he
can
be
a
gentleman
without
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
I
had
thought
about
that
,
while
we
had
been
there
side
by
side
.
No
.
*NL*
Apart
from
any
inclinations
of
my
own
,
I
understood
Wemmick
's
hint
now
.
*NL*
I
foresaw
that
,
being
convicted
,
his
possessions
would
be
forfeited
to
*NL*
the
Crown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookee
here
,
dear
boy
,
''
said
he
``
It
's
best
as
a
gentleman
should
not
be
*NL*
knowed
to
belong
to
me
now
.
Only
come
to
see
me
as
if
you
come
by
chance
*NL*
alonger
Wemmick
.
Sit
where
I
can
see
you
when
I
am
swore
to
,
for
the
*NL*
last
o
'
many
times
,
and
I
do
n't
ask
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
never
stir
from
your
side
,
''
said
I
,
``
when
I
am
suffered
to
be
*NL*
near
you
.
Please
God
,
I
will
be
as
true
to
you
as
you
have
been
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
his
hand
tremble
as
it
held
mine
,
and
he
turned
his
face
away
*NL*
as
he
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
I
heard
that
old
sound
in
his
*NL*
throat
,
--
softened
now
,
like
all
the
rest
of
him
.
It
was
a
good
thing
*NL*
that
he
had
touched
this
point
,
for
it
put
into
my
mind
what
I
might
not
*NL*
otherwise
have
thought
of
until
too
late
,
--
that
he
need
never
know
how
*NL*
his
hopes
of
enriching
me
had
perished
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
LV
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
taken
to
the
Police
Court
next
day
,
and
would
have
been
*NL*
immediately
committed
for
trial
,
but
that
it
was
necessary
to
send
down
*NL*
for
an
old
officer
of
the
prison-ship
from
which
he
had
once
escaped
,
to
*NL*
speak
to
his
identity
.
Nobody
doubted
it
;
but
Compeyson
,
who
had
meant
*NL*
to
depose
to
it
,
was
tumbling
on
the
tides
,
dead
,
and
it
happened
that
*NL*
there
was
not
at
that
time
any
prison
officer
in
London
who
could
give
*NL*
the
required
evidence
.
I
had
gone
direct
to
Mr.
Jaggers
at
his
private
*NL*
house
,
on
my
arrival
over
night
,
to
retain
his
assistance
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
on
the
prisoner
's
behalf
would
admit
nothing
.
It
was
the
sole
*NL*
resource
;
for
he
told
me
that
the
case
must
be
over
in
five
minutes
*NL*
when
the
witness
was
there
,
and
that
no
power
on
earth
could
prevent
its
*NL*
going
against
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
imparted
to
Mr.
Jaggers
my
design
of
keeping
him
in
ignorance
of
the
*NL*
fate
of
his
wealth
.
Mr.
Jaggers
was
querulous
and
angry
with
me
for
*NL*
having
``
let
it
slip
through
my
fingers
,
''
and
said
we
must
memorialize
*NL*
by
and
by
,
and
try
at
all
events
for
some
of
it
.
But
he
did
not
conceal
*NL*
from
me
that
,
although
there
might
be
many
cases
in
which
the
forfeiture
*NL*
would
not
be
exacted
,
there
were
no
circumstances
in
this
case
to
make
*NL*
it
one
of
them
.
I
understood
that
very
well
.
I
was
not
related
to
the
*NL*
outlaw
,
or
connected
with
him
by
any
recognizable
tie
;
he
had
put
his
*NL*
hand
to
no
writing
or
settlement
in
my
favor
before
his
apprehension
,
*NL*
and
to
do
so
now
would
be
idle
.
I
had
no
claim
,
and
I
finally
resolved
,
*NL*
and
ever
afterwards
abided
by
the
resolution
,
that
my
heart
should
never
*NL*
be
sickened
with
the
hopeless
task
of
attempting
to
establish
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
appeared
to
be
reason
for
supposing
that
the
drowned
informer
*NL*
had
hoped
for
a
reward
out
of
this
forfeiture
,
and
had
obtained
some
*NL*
accurate
knowledge
of
Magwitch
's
affairs
.
When
his
body
was
found
,
many
*NL*
miles
from
the
scene
of
his
death
,
and
so
horribly
disfigured
that
he
*NL*
was
only
recognizable
by
the
contents
of
his
pockets
,
notes
were
still
*NL*
legible
,
folded
in
a
case
he
carried
.
Among
these
were
the
name
of
a
*NL*
banking-house
in
New
South
Wales
,
where
a
sum
of
money
was
,
and
the
*NL*
designation
of
certain
lands
of
considerable
value
.
Both
these
heads
of
*NL*
information
were
in
a
list
that
Magwitch
,
while
in
prison
,
gave
to
Mr.
*NL*
Jaggers
,
of
the
possessions
he
supposed
I
should
inherit
.
His
ignorance
,
*NL*
poor
fellow
,
at
last
served
him
;
he
never
mistrusted
but
that
my
*NL*
inheritance
was
quite
safe
,
with
Mr.
Jaggers
's
aid
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
three
days
'
delay
,
during
which
the
crown
prosecution
stood
over
*NL*
for
the
production
of
the
witness
from
the
prison-ship
,
the
witness
*NL*
came
,
and
completed
the
easy
case
.
He
was
committed
to
take
his
trial
at
*NL*
the
next
Sessions
,
which
would
come
on
in
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
dark
time
of
my
life
that
Herbert
returned
home
one
*NL*
evening
,
a
good
deal
cast
down
,
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Handel
,
I
fear
I
shall
soon
have
to
leave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
partner
having
prepared
me
for
that
,
I
was
less
surprised
than
he
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
lose
a
fine
opportunity
if
I
put
off
going
to
Cairo
,
and
I
am
*NL*
very
much
afraid
I
must
go
,
Handel
,
when
you
most
need
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Herbert
,
I
shall
always
need
you
,
because
I
shall
always
love
you
;
but
*NL*
my
need
is
no
greater
now
than
at
another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
so
lonely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
leisure
to
think
of
that
,
''
said
I.
``
You
know
that
I
am
*NL*
always
with
him
to
the
full
extent
of
the
time
allowed
,
and
that
I
*NL*
should
be
with
him
all
day
long
,
if
I
could
.
And
when
I
come
away
from
*NL*
him
,
you
know
that
my
thoughts
are
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dreadful
condition
to
which
he
was
brought
,
was
so
appalling
to
both
*NL*
of
us
,
that
we
could
not
refer
to
it
in
plainer
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Herbert
,
``
let
the
near
prospect
of
our
*NL*
separation
--
for
,
it
is
very
near
--
be
my
justification
for
troubling
you
*NL*
about
yourself
.
Have
you
thought
of
your
future
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
for
I
have
been
afraid
to
think
of
any
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
yours
can
not
be
dismissed
;
indeed
,
my
dear
dear
Handel
,
it
must
not
*NL*
be
dismissed

I
wish
you
would
enter
on
it
now
,
as
far
as
a
few
friendly
*NL*
words
go
,
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
branch
house
of
ours
,
Handel
,
we
must
have
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
that
his
delicacy
was
avoiding
the
right
word
,
so
I
said
,
``
A
*NL*
clerk

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
clerk

And
I
hope
it
is
not
at
all
unlikely
that
he
may
expand
-LRB-
as
*NL*
a
clerk
of
your
acquaintance
has
expanded
-RRB-
into
a
partner
.
Now
,
*NL*
Handel
,
--
in
short
,
my
dear
boy
,
will
you
come
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
charmingly
cordial
and
engaging
in
the
manner
in
*NL*
which
after
saying
``
Now
,
Handel
,
''
as
if
it
were
the
grave
beginning
of
*NL*
a
portentous
business
exordium
,
he
had
suddenly
given
up
that
tone
,
*NL*
stretched
out
his
honest
hand
,
and
spoken
like
a
schoolboy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
and
I
have
talked
about
it
again
and
again

''
Herbert
pursued
,
*NL*
``
and
the
dear
little
thing
begged
me
only
this
evening

with
tears
in

best

happy

he
is
her
friend
too

We
should
get
on
so
well

Handel

*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
her
heartily
,
and
I
thanked
him
heartily
,
but
said
I
could
not
*NL*
yet
make
sure
of
joining
him
as
he
so
kindly
offered
.
Firstly
,
my
*NL*
mind
was
too
preoccupied
to
be
able
to
take
in
the
subject
clearly
.
*NL*
Secondly
,
--
Yes
!
Secondly
,
there
was
a
vague
something
lingering
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
that
will
come
out
very
near
the
end
of
this
slight
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
thought

Herbert
,
that
you
could

without
doing
any
injury

to
your

leave
the
question
open
for
a
little
while

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
any

cried
Herbert
.
``
Six
months

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
long

said
I.
``
Two

*NL*
*NL*
Herbert
was
highly
delighted
when
we
shook
hands
on
this
arrangement
,
*NL*
and
said
he
could
now
take
courage
to
tell
me
that
he
believed
he
must
*NL*
go
away
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Clara

said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

little
thing

returned
Herbert
,
``
holds
dutifully
to

wo
n't
last
long
.
Mrs.
Whimple
*NL*
confides
to
me
that
he
is
certainly
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
say
an
unfeeling
thing
,
''
said
I
,
``
he
can
not
do
better
than
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
that
must
be
admitted
,
''
said
Herbert
;
``
and
then
I
shall
*NL*
come
back
for
the
dear
little
thing
,
and
the
dear
little
thing
and
I
*NL*
will
walk
quietly
into
the
nearest
church
.
Remember
!
The
blessed
darling
*NL*
comes
of
no
family
,
my
dear
Handel
,
and
never
looked
into
the
red
book
,
*NL*
and
has
n't
a
notion
about
her
grandpapa
.
What
a
fortune
for
the
son
of
*NL*
my
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Saturday
in
that
same
week
,
I
took
my
leave
of
Herbert
,
--
full
*NL*
of
bright
hope
,
but
sad
and
sorry
to
leave
me
,
--
as
he
sat
on
one
of
the
*NL*
seaport
mail
coaches
.
I
went
into
a
coffee-house
to
write
a
little
note
*NL*
to
Clara
,
telling
her
he
had
gone
off
,
sending
his
love
to
her
over
and
*NL*
over
again
,
and
then
went
to
my
lonely
home
,
--
if
it
deserved
the
name
;
*NL*
for
it
was
now
no
home
to
me
,
and
I
had
no
home
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
stairs
I
encountered
Wemmick
,
who
was
coming
down
,
after
an
*NL*
unsuccessful
application
of
his
knuckles
to
my
door
.
I
had
not
seen
him
*NL*
alone
since
the
disastrous
issue
of
the
attempted
flight
;
and
he
had
*NL*
come
,
in
his
private
and
personal
capacity
,
to
say
a
few
words
of
*NL*
explanation
in
reference
to
that
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
late
Compeyson
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
``
had
by
little
and
little
got
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
half
of
the
regular
business
now
transacted
;
and
it
was
from
*NL*
the
talk
of
some
of
his
people
in
trouble
-LRB-
some
of
his
people
being
*NL*
always
in
trouble
-RRB-
that
I
heard
what
I
did
.
I
kept
my
ears
open
,
seeming
*NL*
to
have
them
shut
,
until
I
heard
that
he
was
absent
,
and
I
thought
that
*NL*
would
be
the
best
time
for
making
the
attempt
.
I
can
only
suppose
now
,
*NL*
that
it
was
a
part
of
his
policy
,
as
a
very
clever
man
,
habitually
to
*NL*
deceive
his
own
instruments
.
You
do
n't
blame
me
,
I
hope
,
Mr.
Pip
?
I
am
*NL*
sure
I
tried
to
serve
you
,
with
all
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
as
sure
of
that
,
Wemmick
,
as
you
can
be
,
and
I
thank
you
most
*NL*
earnestly
for
all
your
interest
and
friendship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
thank
you
very
much
.
It
's
a
bad
job
,
''
said
Wemmick
,
*NL*
scratching
his
head
,
``
and
I
assure
you
I
have
n't
been
so
cut
up
for
a
*NL*
long
time
.
What
I
look
at
is
the
sacrifice
of
so
much
portable
property
.
*NL*
Dear
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
think
of
,
Wemmick
,
is
the
poor
owner
of
the
property
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
Of
course
,
there
can
be
no
objection
*NL*
to
your
being
sorry
for
him
,
and
I
'd
put
down
a
five-pound
note
myself
*NL*
to
get
him
out
of
it
.
But
what
I
look
at
is
this
.
The
late
Compeyson
*NL*
having
been
beforehand
with
him
in
intelligence
of
his
return
,
and
being
*NL*
so
determined
to
bring
him
to
book
,
I
do
not
think
he
could
have
been
*NL*
saved
.
Whereas
,
the
portable
property
certainly
could
have
been
saved
.
*NL*
That
's
the
difference
between
the
property
and
the
owner
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
invited
Wemmick
to
come
upstairs
,
and
refresh
himself
with
a
glass
*NL*
of
grog
before
walking
to
Walworth
.
He
accepted
the
invitation
.
While
he
*NL*
was
drinking
his
moderate
allowance
,
he
said
,
with
nothing
to
lead
up
to
*NL*
it
,
and
after
having
appeared
rather
fidgety
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
my
meaning
to
take
a
holiday
on
Monday
,
Mr.
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
suppose
you
have
not
done
such
a
thing
these
twelve
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
twelve
years
,
more
likely
,
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
Yes
.
I
'm
going
to
take
*NL*
a
holiday
.
More
than
that
;
I
'm
going
to
take
a
walk
.
More
than
that
;
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
ask
you
to
take
a
walk
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
about
to
excuse
myself
,
as
being
but
a
bad
companion
just
then
,
*NL*
when
Wemmick
anticipated
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
your
engagements
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
I
know
you
are
out
of
sorts
,
*NL*
Mr.
Pip
.
But
if
you
could
oblige
me
,
I
should
take
it
as
a
kindness
.
*NL*
It
ai
n't
a
long
walk
,
and
it
's
an
early
one
.
Say
it
might
occupy
you
*NL*
-LRB-
including
breakfast
on
the
walk
-RRB-
from
eight
to
twelve
.
Could
n't
you
*NL*
stretch
a
point
and
manage
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
done
so
much
for
me
at
various
times
,
that
this
was
very
little
*NL*
to
do
for
him
.
I
said
I
could
manage
it
,
--
would
manage
it
,
--
and
he
was
*NL*
so
very
much
pleased
by
my
acquiescence
,
that
I
was
pleased
too
.
At
his
*NL*
particular
request
,
I
appointed
to
call
for
him
at
the
Castle
at
half
*NL*
past
eight
on
Monday
morning
,
and
so
we
parted
for
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Punctual
to
my
appointment
,
I
rang
at
the
Castle
gate
on
the
Monday
*NL*
morning
,
and
was
received
by
Wemmick
himself
,
who
struck
me
as
looking
*NL*
tighter
than
usual
,
and
having
a
sleeker
hat
on
.
Within
,
there
were
two
*NL*
glasses
of
rum
and
milk
prepared
,
and
two
biscuits
.
The
Aged
must
have
*NL*
been
stirring
with
the
lark
,
for
,
glancing
into
the
perspective
of
his
*NL*
bedroom
,
I
observed
that
his
bed
was
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
fortified
ourselves
with
the
rum
and
milk
and
biscuits
,
and
*NL*
were
going
out
for
the
walk
with
that
training
preparation
on
us
,
I
was
*NL*
considerably
surprised
to
see
Wemmick
take
up
a
fishing-rod
,
and
put
*NL*
it
over
his
shoulder
.
``
Why
,
we
are
not
going
fishing
!
''
said
I.
``
No
,
''
*NL*
returned
Wemmick
,
``
but
I
like
to
walk
with
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
this
odd
;
however
,
I
said
nothing
,
and
we
set
off
.
We
went
*NL*
towards
Camberwell
Green
,
and
when
we
were
thereabouts
,
Wemmick
said
*NL*
suddenly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
Here
's
a
church
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
very
surprising
in
that
;
but
again
,
I
was
rather
*NL*
surprised
,
when
he
said
,
as
if
he
were
animated
by
a
brilliant
idea
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
in
,
Wemmick
leaving
his
fishing-rod
in
the
porch
,
and
looked
all
*NL*
round
.
In
the
mean
time
,
Wemmick
was
diving
into
his
coat-pockets
,
and
*NL*
getting
something
out
of
paper
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
''
said
he
.
``
Here
's
a
couple
of
pair
of
gloves
!
Let
's
put
'em
*NL*
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
gloves
were
white
kid
gloves
,
and
as
the
post-office
was
widened
*NL*
to
its
utmost
extent
,
I
now
began
to
have
my
strong
suspicions
.
They
*NL*
were
strengthened
into
certainty
when
I
beheld
the
Aged
enter
at
a
side
*NL*
door
,
escorting
a
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloa
!
''
said
Wemmick
.
``
Here
's
Miss
Skiffins
!
Let
's
have
a
wedding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
discreet
damsel
was
attired
as
usual
,
except
that
she
was
now
*NL*
engaged
in
substituting
for
her
green
kid
gloves
a
pair
of
white
.
The
*NL*
Aged
was
likewise
occupied
in
preparing
a
similar
sacrifice
for
*NL*
the
altar
of
Hymen
.
The
old
gentleman
,
however
,
experienced
so
much
*NL*
difficulty
in
getting
his
gloves
on
,
that
Wemmick
found
it
necessary
*NL*
to
put
him
with
his
back
against
a
pillar
,
and
then
to
get
behind
the
*NL*
pillar
himself
and
pull
away
at
them
,
while
I
for
my
part
held
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
round
the
waist
,
that
he
might
present
an
equal
and
safe
*NL*
resistance
.
By
dint
of
this
ingenious
scheme
,
his
gloves
were
got
on
to
*NL*
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
and
clergyman
then
appearing
,
we
were
ranged
in
order
at
*NL*
those
fatal
rails
.
True
to
his
notion
of
seeming
to
do
it
all
without
*NL*
preparation
,
I
heard
Wemmick
say
to
himself
,
as
he
took
something
out
of
*NL*
his
waistcoat-pocket
before
the
service
began
,
``
Halloa
!
Here
's
a
ring
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
acted
in
the
capacity
of
backer
,
or
best-man
,
to
the
bridegroom
;
while
*NL*
a
little
limp
pew-opener
in
a
soft
bonnet
like
a
baby
's
,
made
a
feint
*NL*
of
being
the
bosom
friend
of
Miss
Skiffins
.
The
responsibility
of
giving
*NL*
the
lady
away
devolved
upon
the
Aged
,
which
led
to
the
clergyman
's
being
*NL*
unintentionally
scandalized
,
and
it
happened
thus
.
When
he
said
,
``
Who
*NL*
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
?
''
the
old
gentleman
,
not
in
*NL*
the
least
knowing
what
point
of
the
ceremony
we
had
arrived
at
,
stood
*NL*
most
amiably
beaming
at
the
ten
commandments
.
Upon
which
,
the
clergyman
*NL*
said
again
,
``
WHO
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
?
''
The
old
*NL*
gentleman
being
still
in
a
state
of
most
estimable
unconsciousness
,
the
*NL*
bridegroom
cried
out
in
his
accustomed
voice
,
``
Now
Aged
P.
you
know
;
who
*NL*
giveth
?
''
To
which
the
Aged
replied
with
great
briskness
,
before
saying
*NL*
that
he
gave
,
``
All
right
,
John
,
all
right
,
my
boy
!
''
And
the
clergyman
*NL*
came
to
so
gloomy
a
pause
upon
it
,
that
I
had
doubts
for
the
moment
*NL*
whether
we
should
get
completely
married
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
completely
done
,
however
,
and
when
we
were
going
out
of
church
*NL*
Wemmick
took
the
cover
off
the
font
,
and
put
his
white
gloves
in
it
,
and
*NL*
put
the
cover
on
again
.
Mrs.
Wemmick
,
more
heedful
of
the
future
,
put
*NL*
her
white
gloves
in
her
pocket
and
assumed
her
green
.
``
Now
,
Mr.
Pip
,
''
*NL*
said
Wemmick
,
triumphantly
shouldering
the
fishing-rod
as
we
came
*NL*
out
,
``
let
me
ask
you
whether
anybody
would
suppose
this
to
be
a
*NL*
wedding-party
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Breakfast
had
been
ordered
at
a
pleasant
little
tavern
,
a
mile
or
so
*NL*
away
upon
the
rising
ground
beyond
the
green
;
and
there
was
a
bagatelle
*NL*
board
in
the
room
,
in
case
we
should
desire
to
unbend
our
minds
after
*NL*
the
solemnity
.
It
was
pleasant
to
observe
that
Mrs.
Wemmick
no
longer
*NL*
unwound
Wemmick
's
arm
when
it
adapted
itself
to
her
figure
,
but
sat
in
a
*NL*
high-backed
chair
against
the
wall
,
like
a
violoncello
in
its
case
,
and
*NL*
submitted
to
be
embraced
as
that
melodious
instrument
might
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
an
excellent
breakfast
,
and
when
any
one
declined
anything
on
*NL*
table
,
Wemmick
said
,
``
Provided
by
contract
,
you
know
;
do
n't
be
afraid
of
*NL*
it
!
''
I
drank
to
the
new
couple
,
drank
to
the
Aged
,
drank
to
the
Castle
,
*NL*
saluted
the
bride
at
parting
,
and
made
myself
as
agreeable
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
came
down
to
the
door
with
me
,
and
I
again
shook
hands
with
him
,
*NL*
and
wished
him
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thankee
!
''
said
Wemmick
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
``
She
's
such
a
manager
*NL*
of
fowls
,
you
have
no
idea
.
You
shall
have
some
eggs
,
and
judge
for
*NL*
yourself
.
I
say
,
Mr.
Pip
!
''
calling
me
back
,
and
speaking
low
.
``
This
is
*NL*
altogether
a
Walworth
sentiment
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
.
Not
to
be
mentioned
in
Little
Britain
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Wemmick
nodded
.
``
After
what
you
let
out
the
other
day
,
Mr.
Jaggers
*NL*
may
as
well
not
know
of
it
.
He
might
think
my
brain
was
softening
,
or
*NL*
something
of
the
kind

Chapter
LVI
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
in
prison
very
ill
,
during
the
whole
interval
between
his
*NL*
committal
for
trial
and
the
coming
round
of
the
Sessions
.
He
had
broken
*NL*
two
ribs
,
they
had
wounded
one
of
his
lungs
,
and
he
breathed
with
great
*NL*
pain
and
difficulty
,
which
increased
daily
.
It
was
a
consequence
of
his
*NL*
hurt
that
he
spoke
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
;
therefore
he
spoke
*NL*
very
little
.
But
he
was
ever
ready
to
listen
to
me
;
and
it
became
the
*NL*
first
duty
of
my
life
to
say
to
him
,
and
read
to
him
,
what
I
knew
he
*NL*
ought
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
far
too
ill
to
remain
in
the
common
prison
,
he
was
removed
,
after
*NL*
the
first
day
or
so
,
into
the
infirmary
.
This
gave
me
opportunities
*NL*
of
being
with
him
that
I
could
not
otherwise
have
had
.
And
but
for
*NL*
his
illness
he
would
have
been
put
in
irons
,
for
he
was
regarded
as
a
*NL*
determined
prison-breaker
,
and
I
know
not
what
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
saw
him
every
day
,
it
was
for
only
a
short
time
;
hence
,
the
*NL*
regularly
recurring
spaces
of
our
separation
were
long
enough
to
record
*NL*
on
his
face
any
slight
changes
that
occurred
in
his
physical
state
.
I
*NL*
do
not
recollect
that
I
once
saw
any
change
in
it
for
the
better
;
he
*NL*
wasted
,
and
became
slowly
weaker
and
worse
,
day
by
day
,
from
the
day
*NL*
when
the
prison
door
closed
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kind
of
submission
or
resignation
that
he
showed
was
that
of
a
man
*NL*
who
was
tired
out
.
I
sometimes
derived
an
impression
,
from
his
manner
*NL*
or
from
a
whispered
word
or
two
which
escaped
him
,
that
he
pondered
*NL*
over
the
question
whether
he
might
have
been
a
better
man
under
better
*NL*
circumstances
.
But
he
never
justified
himself
by
a
hint
tending
that
*NL*
way
,
or
tried
to
bend
the
past
out
of
its
eternal
shape
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
on
two
or
three
occasions
in
my
presence
,
that
his
desperate
*NL*
reputation
was
alluded
to
by
one
or
other
of
the
people
in
attendance
on
*NL*
him
.
A
smile
crossed
his
face
then
,
and
he
turned
his
eyes
on
me
with
*NL*
a
trustful
look
,
as
if
he
were
confident
that
I
had
seen
some
small
*NL*
redeeming
touch
in
him
,
even
so
long
ago
as
when
I
was
a
little
child
.
*NL*
As
to
all
the
rest
,
he
was
humble
and
contrite
,
and
I
never
knew
him
*NL*
complain
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Sessions
came
round
,
Mr.
Jaggers
caused
an
application
to
be
*NL*
made
for
the
postponement
of
his
trial
until
the
following
Sessions
.
It
*NL*
was
obviously
made
with
the
assurance
that
he
could
not
live
so
long
,
*NL*
and
was
refused
.
The
trial
came
on
at
once
,
and
,
when
he
was
put
to
the
*NL*
bar
,
he
was
seated
in
a
chair
.
No
objection
was
made
to
my
getting
*NL*
close
to
the
dock
,
on
the
outside
of
it
,
and
holding
the
hand
that
he
*NL*
stretched
forth
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trial
was
very
short
and
very
clear
.
Such
things
as
could
be
said
*NL*
for
him
were
said
,
--
how
he
had
taken
to
industrious
habits
,
and
had
*NL*
thriven
lawfully
and
reputably
.
But
nothing
could
unsay
the
fact
that
*NL*
he
had
returned
,
and
was
there
in
presence
of
the
Judge
and
Jury
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
to
try
him
for
that
,
and
do
otherwise
than
find
him
guilty
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
,
it
was
the
custom
-LRB-
as
I
learnt
from
my
terrible
experience
*NL*
of
that
Sessions
-RRB-
to
devote
a
concluding
day
to
the
passing
of
*NL*
Sentences
,
and
to
make
a
finishing
effect
with
the
Sentence
of
Death
.
*NL*
But
for
the
indelible
picture
that
my
remembrance
now
holds
before
me
,
*NL*
I
could
scarcely
believe
,
even
as
I
write
these
words
,
that
I
saw
*NL*
two-and-thirty
men
and
women
put
before
the
Judge
to
receive
that
*NL*
sentence
together
.
Foremost
among
the
two-and-thirty
was
he
;
seated
,
*NL*
that
he
might
get
breath
enough
to
keep
life
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
scene
starts
out
again
in
the
vivid
colors
of
the
moment
,
down
*NL*
to
the
drops
of
April
rain
on
the
windows
of
the
court
,
glittering
in
*NL*
the
rays
of
April
sun
.
Penned
in
the
dock
,
as
I
again
stood
outside
it
*NL*
at
the
corner
with
his
hand
in
mine
,
were
the
two-and-thirty
men
*NL*
and
women
;
some
defiant
,
some
stricken
with
terror
,
some
sobbing
and
*NL*
weeping
,
some
covering
their
faces
,
some
staring
gloomily
about
.
There
*NL*
had
been
shrieks
from
among
the
women
convicts
;
but
they
had
been
*NL*
stilled
,
and
a
hush
had
succeeded
.
The
sheriffs
with
their
great
chains
*NL*
and
nosegays
,
other
civic
gewgaws
and
monsters
,
criers
,
ushers
,
a
great
*NL*
gallery
full
of
people
,
--
a
large
theatrical
audience
,
--
looked
on
,
as
the
*NL*
two-and-thirty
and
the
Judge
were
solemnly
confronted
.
Then
the
Judge
*NL*
addressed
them
.
Among
the
wretched
creatures
before
him
whom
he
must
*NL*
single
out
for
special
address
was
one
who
almost
from
his
infancy
had
*NL*
been
an
offender
against
the
laws
;
who
,
after
repeated
imprisonments
and
*NL*
punishments
,
had
been
at
length
sentenced
to
exile
for
a
term
of
years
;
*NL*
and
who
,
under
circumstances
of
great
violence
and
daring
,
had
made
his
*NL*
escape
and
been
re-sentenced
to
exile
for
life
.
That
miserable
man
would
*NL*
seem
for
a
time
to
have
become
convinced
of
his
errors
,
when
far
removed
*NL*
from
the
scenes
of
his
old
offences
,
and
to
have
lived
a
peaceable
and
*NL*
honest
life
.
But
in
a
fatal
moment
,
yielding
to
those
propensities
and
*NL*
passions
,
the
indulgence
of
which
had
so
long
rendered
him
a
scourge
to
*NL*
society
,
he
had
quitted
his
haven
of
rest
and
repentance
,
and
had
*NL*
come
back
to
the
country
where
he
was
proscribed
.
Being
here
presently
*NL*
denounced
,
he
had
for
a
time
succeeded
in
evading
the
officers
of
*NL*
Justice
,
but
being
at
length
seized
while
in
the
act
of
flight
,
he
had
*NL*
resisted
them
,
and
had
--
he
best
knew
whether
by
express
design
,
or
in
*NL*
the
blindness
of
his
hardihood
--
caused
the
death
of
his
denouncer
,
to
*NL*
whom
his
whole
career
was
known
.
The
appointed
punishment
for
his
return
*NL*
to
the
land
that
had
cast
him
out
,
being
Death
,
and
his
case
being
this
*NL*
aggravated
case
,
he
must
prepare
himself
to
Die
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
striking
in
at
the
great
windows
of
the
court
,
through
the
*NL*
glittering
drops
of
rain
upon
the
glass
,
and
it
made
a
broad
shaft
of
*NL*
light
between
the
two-and-thirty
and
the
Judge
,
linking
both
together
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
reminding
some
among
the
audience
how
both
were
passing
on
,
*NL*
with
absolute
equality
,
to
the
greater
Judgment
that
knoweth
all
things
,
*NL*
and
can
not
err
.
Rising
for
a
moment
,
a
distinct
speck
of
face
in
this
*NL*
way
of
light
,
the
prisoner
said
,
``
My
Lord
,
I
have
received
my
sentence
*NL*
of
Death
from
the
Almighty
,
but
I
bow
to
yours
,
''
and
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
There
was
some
hushing
,
and
the
Judge
went
on
with
what
he
had
to
say
*NL*
to
the
rest
.
Then
they
were
all
formally
doomed
,
and
some
of
them
were
*NL*
supported
out
,
and
some
of
them
sauntered
out
with
a
haggard
look
of
*NL*
bravery
,
and
a
few
nodded
to
the
gallery
,
and
two
or
three
shook
hands
,
*NL*
and
others
went
out
chewing
the
fragments
of
herb
they
had
taken
from
*NL*
the
sweet
herbs
lying
about
.
He
went
last
of
all
,
because
of
having
to
*NL*
be
helped
from
his
chair
,
and
to
go
very
slowly
;
and
he
held
my
hand
*NL*
while
all
the
others
were
removed
,
and
while
the
audience
got
up
*NL*
-LRB-
putting
their
dresses
right
,
as
they
might
at
church
or
elsewhere
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
pointed
down
at
this
criminal
or
at
that
,
and
most
of
all
at
him
and
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
earnestly
hoped
and
prayed
that
he
might
die
before
the
Recorder
's
*NL*
Report
was
made
;
but
,
in
the
dread
of
his
lingering
on
,
I
began
that
*NL*
night
to
write
out
a
petition
to
the
Home
Secretary
of
State
,
setting
*NL*
forth
my
knowledge
of
him
,
and
how
it
was
that
he
had
come
back
for
my
*NL*
sake
.
I
wrote
it
as
fervently
and
pathetically
as
I
could
;
and
when
I
*NL*
had
finished
it
and
sent
it
in
,
I
wrote
out
other
petitions
to
such
men
*NL*
in
authority
as
I
hoped
were
the
most
merciful
,
and
drew
up
one
to
the
*NL*
Crown
itself
.
For
several
days
and
nights
after
he
was
sentenced
I
took
*NL*
no
rest
except
when
I
fell
asleep
in
my
chair
,
but
was
wholly
absorbed
*NL*
in
these
appeals
.
And
after
I
had
sent
them
in
,
I
could
not
keep
away
*NL*
from
the
places
where
they
were
,
but
felt
as
if
they
were
more
*NL*
hopeful
and
less
desperate
when
I
was
near
them
.
In
this
unreasonable
*NL*
restlessness
and
pain
of
mind
I
would
roam
the
streets
of
an
evening
,
*NL*
wandering
by
those
offices
and
houses
where
I
had
left
the
petitions
.
To
*NL*
the
present
hour
,
the
weary
western
streets
of
London
on
a
cold
,
dusty
*NL*
spring
night
,
with
their
ranges
of
stern
,
shut-up
mansions
,
and
their
*NL*
long
rows
of
lamps
,
are
melancholy
to
me
from
this
association
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
daily
visits
I
could
make
him
were
shortened
now
,
and
he
was
more
*NL*
strictly
kept
.
Seeing
,
or
fancying
,
that
I
was
suspected
of
an
intention
*NL*
of
carrying
poison
to
him
,
I
asked
to
be
searched
before
I
sat
down
*NL*
at
his
bedside
,
and
told
the
officer
who
was
always
there
,
that
I
was
*NL*
willing
to
do
anything
that
would
assure
him
of
the
singleness
of
my
*NL*
designs
.
Nobody
was
hard
with
him
or
with
me
.
There
was
duty
to
be
*NL*
done
,
and
it
was
done
,
but
not
harshly
.
The
officer
always
gave
me
the
*NL*
assurance
that
he
was
worse
,
and
some
other
sick
prisoners
in
the
*NL*
room
,
and
some
other
prisoners
who
attended
on
them
as
sick
nurses
,
*NL*
-LRB-
malefactors
,
but
not
incapable
of
kindness
,
God
be
thanked
!
-RRB-
always
*NL*
joined
in
the
same
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
days
went
on
,
I
noticed
more
and
more
that
he
would
lie
placidly
*NL*
looking
at
the
white
ceiling
,
with
an
absence
of
light
in
his
face
*NL*
until
some
word
of
mine
brightened
it
for
an
instant
,
and
then
it
would
*NL*
subside
again
.
Sometimes
he
was
almost
or
quite
unable
to
speak
,
then
*NL*
he
would
answer
me
with
slight
pressures
on
my
hand
,
and
I
grew
to
*NL*
understand
his
meaning
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
number
of
the
days
had
risen
to
ten
,
when
I
saw
a
greater
change
*NL*
in
him
than
I
had
seen
yet
.
His
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
door
,
and
*NL*
lighted
up
as
I
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
boy
,
''
he
said
,
as
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
:
``
I
thought
you
was
late
.
*NL*
But
I
knowed
you
could
n't
be
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
just
the
time
,
''
said
I.
``
I
waited
for
it
at
the
gate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
waits
at
the
gate
;
do
n't
you
,
dear
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Not
to
lose
a
moment
of
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
`
ee
dear
boy
,
thank
`
ee
.
God
bless
you
!
You
've
never
deserted
me
,
*NL*
dear
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
pressed
his
hand
in
silence
,
for
I
could
not
forget
that
I
had
once
*NL*
meant
to
desert
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
's
the
best
of
all
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
've
been
more
comfortable
*NL*
alonger
me
,
since
I
was
under
a
dark
cloud
,
than
when
the
sun
shone
.
*NL*
That
's
best
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
on
his
back
,
breathing
with
great
difficulty
.
Do
what
he
would
,
*NL*
and
love
me
though
he
did
,
the
light
left
his
face
ever
and
again
,
and
a
*NL*
film
came
over
the
placid
look
at
the
white
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
in
much
pain
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
complain
of
none
,
dear
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
do
complain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spoken
his
last
words
.
He
smiled
,
and
I
understood
his
touch
to
*NL*
mean
that
he
wished
to
lift
my
hand
,
and
lay
it
on
his
breast
.
I
laid
it
*NL*
there
,
and
he
smiled
again
,
and
put
both
his
hands
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
allotted
time
ran
out
,
while
we
were
thus
;
but
,
looking
round
,
I
*NL*
found
the
governor
of
the
prison
standing
near
me
,
and
he
whispered
,
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
go
yet
.
''
I
thanked
him
gratefully
,
and
asked
,
``
Might
I
*NL*
speak
to
him
,
if
he
can
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
governor
stepped
aside
,
and
beckoned
the
officer
away
.
The
change
,
*NL*
though
it
was
made
without
noise
,
drew
back
the
film
from
the
placid
*NL*
look
at
the
white
ceiling
,
and
he
looked
most
affectionately
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Magwitch
,
I
must
tell
you
now
,
at
last
.
You
understand
what
I
*NL*
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
gentle
pressure
on
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
a
child
once
,
whom
you
loved
and
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
stronger
pressure
on
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
lived
,
and
found
powerful
friends
.
She
is
living
now
.
She
is
a
lady
*NL*
and
very
beautiful
.
And
I
love
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
last
faint
effort
,
which
would
have
been
powerless
but
for
my
*NL*
yielding
to
it
and
assisting
it
,
he
raised
my
hand
to
his
lips
.
Then
,
*NL*
he
gently
let
it
sink
upon
his
breast
again
,
with
his
own
hands
lying
on
*NL*
it
.
The
placid
look
at
the
white
ceiling
came
back
,
and
passed
away
,
and
*NL*
his
head
dropped
quietly
on
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mindful
,
then
,
of
what
we
had
read
together
,
I
thought
of
the
two
men
*NL*
who
went
up
into
the
Temple
to
pray
,
and
I
knew
there
were
no
better
*NL*
words
that
I
could
say
beside
his
bed
,
than
``
O
Lord
,

Chapter
LVII
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
I
was
left
wholly
to
myself
,
I
gave
notice
of
my
intention
*NL*
to
quit
the
chambers
in
the
Temple
as
soon
as
my
tenancy
could
legally
*NL*
determine
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
to
underlet
them
.
At
once
I
put
bills
*NL*
up
in
the
windows
;
for
,
I
was
in
debt
,
and
had
scarcely
any
money
,
and
*NL*
began
to
be
seriously
alarmed
by
the
state
of
my
affairs
.
I
ought
*NL*
rather
to
write
that
I
should
have
been
alarmed
if
I
had
had
energy
and
*NL*
concentration
enough
to
help
me
to
the
clear
perception
of
any
truth
*NL*
beyond
the
fact
that
I
was
falling
very
ill
.
The
late
stress
upon
me
had
*NL*
enabled
me
to
put
off
illness
,
but
not
to
put
it
away
;
I
knew
that
it
*NL*
was
coming
on
me
now
,
and
I
knew
very
little
else
,
and
was
even
careless
*NL*
as
to
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
day
or
two
,
I
lay
on
the
sofa
,
or
on
the
floor
,
--
anywhere
,
*NL*
according
as
I
happened
to
sink
down
,
--
with
a
heavy
head
and
aching
*NL*
limbs
,
and
no
purpose
,
and
no
power
.
Then
there
came
,
one
night
which
*NL*
appeared
of
great
duration
,
and
which
teemed
with
anxiety
and
horror
;
*NL*
and
when
in
the
morning
I
tried
to
sit
up
in
my
bed
and
think
of
it
,
I
*NL*
found
I
could
not
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
I
really
had
been
down
in
Garden
Court
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
*NL*
groping
about
for
the
boat
that
I
supposed
to
be
there
;
whether
I
had
*NL*
two
or
three
times
come
to
myself
on
the
staircase
with
great
terror
,
*NL*
not
knowing
how
I
had
got
out
of
bed
;
whether
I
had
found
myself
*NL*
lighting
the
lamp
,
possessed
by
the
idea
that
he
was
coming
up
*NL*
the
stairs
,
and
that
the
lights
were
blown
out
;
whether
I
had
been
*NL*
inexpressibly
harassed
by
the
distracted
talking
,
laughing
,
and
groaning
*NL*
of
some
one
,
and
had
half
suspected
those
sounds
to
be
of
my
own
making
;
*NL*
whether
there
had
been
a
closed
iron
furnace
in
a
dark
corner
of
*NL*
the
room
,
and
a
voice
had
called
out
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
Miss
*NL*
Havisham
was
consuming
within
it
,
--
these
were
things
that
I
tried
to
*NL*
settle
with
myself
and
get
into
some
order
,
as
I
lay
that
morning
on
*NL*
my
bed
.
But
the
vapor
of
a
limekiln
would
come
between
me
and
them
,
*NL*
disordering
them
all
,
and
it
was
through
the
vapor
at
last
that
I
saw
*NL*
two
men
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
I
asked
,
starting
;
``
I
do
n't
know
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
returned
one
of
them
,
bending
down
and
touching
me
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
,
``
this
is
a
matter
that
you
'll
soon
arrange
,
I
dare
say
,
but
*NL*
you
're
arrested
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
debt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hundred
and
twenty-three
pound
,
fifteen
,
six
.
Jeweller
's
account
,
I
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
come
to
my
house
,
''
said
the
man
.
``
I
keep
a
very
nice
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
some
attempt
to
get
up
and
dress
myself
.
When
I
next
attended
*NL*
to
them
,
they
were
standing
a
little
off
from
the
bed
,
looking
at
me
.
I
*NL*
still
lay
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
my
state
,
''
said
I.
``
I
would
come
with
you
if
I
could
;
but
*NL*
indeed
I
am
quite
unable
.
If
you
take
me
from
here
,
I
think
I
shall
die
*NL*
by
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
they
replied
,
or
argued
the
point
,
or
tried
to
encourage
me
to
*NL*
believe
that
I
was
better
than
I
thought
.
Forasmuch
as
they
hang
in
*NL*
my
memory
by
only
this
one
slender
thread
,
I
do
n't
know
what
they
did
,
*NL*
except
that
they
forbore
to
remove
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
I
had
a
fever
and
was
avoided
,
that
I
suffered
greatly
,
that
*NL*
I
often
lost
my
reason
,
that
the
time
seemed
interminable
,
that
I
*NL*
confounded
impossible
existences
with
my
own
identity
;
that
I
was
a
*NL*
brick
in
the
house-wall
,
and
yet
entreating
to
be
released
from
the
*NL*
giddy
place
where
the
builders
had
set
me
;
that
I
was
a
steel
beam
of
a
*NL*
vast
engine
,
clashing
and
whirling
over
a
gulf
,
and
yet
that
I
implored
*NL*
in
my
own
person
to
have
the
engine
stopped
,
and
my
part
in
it
hammered
*NL*
off
;
that
I
passed
through
these
phases
of
disease
,
I
know
of
my
own
*NL*
remembrance
,
and
did
in
some
sort
know
at
the
time
.
That
I
sometimes
*NL*
struggled
with
real
people
,
in
the
belief
that
they
were
murderers
,
and
*NL*
that
I
would
all
at
once
comprehend
that
they
meant
to
do
me
good
,
and
*NL*
would
then
sink
exhausted
in
their
arms
,
and
suffer
them
to
lay
me
*NL*
down
,
I
also
knew
at
the
time
.
But
,
above
all
,
I
knew
that
there
was
a
*NL*
constant
tendency
in
all
these
people
,
--
who
,
when
I
was
very
ill
,
would
*NL*
present
all
kinds
of
extraordinary
transformations
of
the
human
face
,
*NL*
and
would
be
much
dilated
in
size
,
--
above
all
,
I
say
,
I
knew
that
there
*NL*
was
an
extraordinary
tendency
in
all
these
people
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
*NL*
settle
down
into
the
likeness
of
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
turned
the
worst
point
of
my
illness
,
I
began
to
notice
that
*NL*
while
all
its
other
features
changed
,
this
one
consistent
feature
did
*NL*
not
change
.
Whoever
came
about
me
,
still
settled
down
into
Joe
.
I
opened
*NL*
my
eyes
in
the
night
,
and
I
saw
,
in
the
great
chair
at
the
bedside
,
Joe
.
*NL*
I
opened
my
eyes
in
the
day
,
and
,
sitting
on
the
window-seat
,
smoking
*NL*
his
pipe
in
the
shaded
open
window
,
still
I
saw
Joe
.
I
asked
for
cooling
*NL*
drink
,
and
the
dear
hand
that
gave
it
me
was
Joe
's
.
I
sank
back
on
*NL*
my
pillow
after
drinking
,
and
the
face
that
looked
so
hopefully
and
*NL*
tenderly
upon
me
was
the
face
of
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
one
day
,
I
took
courage
,
and
said
,
``
Is
it
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
dear
old
home-voice
answered
,
``
Which
it
air
,
old
chap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Joe
,
you
break
my
heart
!
Look
angry
at
me
,
Joe
.
Strike
me
,
Joe
.
Tell
*NL*
me
of
my
ingratitude
.
Do
n't
be
so
good
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
Joe
had
actually
laid
his
head
down
on
the
pillow
at
my
side
,
and
*NL*
put
his
arm
round
my
neck
,
in
his
joy
that
I
knew
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
dear
old
Pip
,
old
chap
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
you
and
me
was
ever
friends
.
*NL*
And
when
you
're
well
enough
to
go
out
for
a
ride
--
what
larks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
which
,
Joe
withdrew
to
the
window
,
and
stood
with
his
back
towards
*NL*
me
,
wiping
his
eyes
.
And
as
my
extreme
weakness
prevented
me
from
*NL*
getting
up
and
going
to
him
,
I
lay
there
,
penitently
whispering
,
``
O
God
*NL*
bless
him
!
O
God
bless
this
gentle
Christian
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
's
eyes
were
red
when
I
next
found
him
beside
me
;
but
I
was
holding
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
we
both
felt
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
,
dear
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
you
meantersay
,
Pip
,
how
long
have
your
illness
lasted
,
dear
old
*NL*
chap
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
end
of
May
,
Pip
.
To-morrow
is
the
first
of
June
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
been
here
all
that
time
,
dear
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
nigh
,
old
chap
.
For
,
as
I
says
to
Biddy
when
the
news
of
your
*NL*
being
ill
were
brought
by
letter
,
which
it
were
brought
by
the
post
,
and
*NL*
being
formerly
single
he
is
now
married
though
underpaid
for
a
deal
of
*NL*
walking
and
shoe-leather
,
but
wealth
were
not
a
object
on
his
part
,
and
*NL*
marriage
were
the
great
wish
of
his
hart
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
delightful
to
hear
you
,
Joe
!
But
I
interrupt
you
in
what
you
*NL*
said
to
Biddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
it
were
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
that
how
you
might
be
amongst
strangers
,
and
*NL*
that
how
you
and
me
having
been
ever
friends
,
a
wisit
at
such
a
moment
*NL*
might
not
prove
unacceptabobble
.
And
Biddy
,
her
word
were
,
`
Go
to
him
,
*NL*
without
loss
of
time
.
'
That
,
''
said
Joe
,
summing
up
with
his
judicial
*NL*
air
,
``
were
the
word
of
Biddy
.
`
Go
to
him
,
'
Biddy
say
,
`
without
loss
of
*NL*
time
.
'
In
short
,
I
should
n't
greatly
deceive
you
,
''
Joe
added
,
after
a
*NL*
little
grave
reflection
,
``
if
I
represented
to
you
that
the
word
of
that
*NL*
young
woman
were
,
`
without
a
minute
's
loss
of
time
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
Joe
cut
himself
short
,
and
informed
me
that
I
was
to
be
talked
*NL*
to
in
great
moderation
,
and
that
I
was
to
take
a
little
nourishment
at
*NL*
stated
frequent
times
,
whether
I
felt
inclined
for
it
or
not
,
and
that
*NL*
I
was
to
submit
myself
to
all
his
orders
.
So
I
kissed
his
hand
,
and
lay
*NL*
quiet
,
while
he
proceeded
to
indite
a
note
to
Biddy
,
with
my
love
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
Biddy
had
taught
Joe
to
write
.
As
I
lay
in
bed
looking
at
him
,
*NL*
it
made
me
,
in
my
weak
state
,
cry
again
with
pleasure
to
see
the
*NL*
pride
with
which
he
set
about
his
letter
.
My
bedstead
,
divested
of
its
*NL*
curtains
,
had
been
removed
,
with
me
upon
it
,
into
the
sitting-room
,
as
*NL*
the
airiest
and
largest
,
and
the
carpet
had
been
taken
away
,
and
*NL*
the
room
kept
always
fresh
and
wholesome
night
and
day
.
At
my
own
*NL*
writing-table
,
pushed
into
a
corner
and
cumbered
with
little
bottles
,
*NL*
Joe
now
sat
down
to
his
great
work
,
first
choosing
a
pen
from
the
*NL*
pen-tray
as
if
it
were
a
chest
of
large
tools
,
and
tucking
up
his
*NL*
sleeves
as
if
he
were
going
to
wield
a
crow-bar
or
sledgehammer
.
It
was
*NL*
necessary
for
Joe
to
hold
on
heavily
to
the
table
with
his
left
elbow
,
*NL*
and
to
get
his
right
leg
well
out
behind
him
,
before
he
could
begin
;
and
*NL*
when
he
did
begin
he
made
every
downstroke
so
slowly
that
it
might
*NL*
have
been
six
feet
long
,
while
at
every
upstroke
I
could
hear
his
pen
*NL*
spluttering
extensively
.
He
had
a
curious
idea
that
the
inkstand
was
*NL*
on
the
side
of
him
where
it
was
not
,
and
constantly
dipped
his
pen
into
*NL*
space
,
and
seemed
quite
satisfied
with
the
result
.
Occasionally
,
he
was
*NL*
tripped
up
by
some
orthographical
stumbling-block
;
but
on
the
whole
*NL*
he
got
on
very
well
indeed
;
and
when
he
had
signed
his
name
,
and
had
*NL*
removed
a
finishing
blot
from
the
paper
to
the
crown
of
his
head
with
*NL*
his
two
forefingers
,
he
got
up
and
hovered
about
the
table
,
trying
the
*NL*
effect
of
his
performance
from
various
points
of
view
,
as
it
lay
there
,
*NL*
with
unbounded
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
to
make
Joe
uneasy
by
talking
too
much
,
even
if
I
had
been
able
to
*NL*
talk
much
,
I
deferred
asking
him
about
Miss
Havisham
until
next
day
.
He
*NL*
shook
his
head
when
I
then
asked
him
if
she
had
recovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
dead
,
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
you
see
,
old
chap
,
''
said
Joe
,
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
,
and
by
way
*NL*
of
getting
at
it
by
degrees
,
``
I
would
n't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
,
for
*NL*
that
's
a
deal
to
say
;
but
she
ai
n't
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Living
,
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nigher
where
it
is
,
''
said
Joe
;
``
she
ai
n't
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
linger
long
,
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arter
you
was
took
ill
,
pretty
much
about
what
you
might
call
-LRB-
if
you
*NL*
was
put
to
it
-RRB-
a
week
,
''
said
Joe
;
still
determined
,
on
my
account
,
to
*NL*
come
at
everything
by
degrees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Joe
,
have
you
heard
what
becomes
of
her
property
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
old
chap
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
it
do
appear
that
she
had
settled
the
most
*NL*
of
it
,
which
I
meantersay
tied
it
up
,
on
Miss
Estella
.
But
she
had
*NL*
wrote
out
a
little
coddleshell
in
her
own
hand
a
day
or
two
afore
the
*NL*
accident
,
leaving
a
cool
four
thousand
to
Mr.
Matthew
Pocket
.
And
why
,
*NL*
do
you
suppose
,
above
all
things
,
Pip
,
she
left
that
cool
four
thousand
*NL*
unto
him
?
`
Because
of
Pip
's
account
of
him
,
the
said
Matthew
.
'
I
am
told
*NL*
by
Biddy
,
that
air
the
writing
,
''
said
Joe
,
repeating
the
legal
turn
as
*NL*
if
it
did
him
infinite
good
,
''
`
account
of
him
the
said
Matthew
.
'
And
a
*NL*
cool
four
thousand
,
Pip
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
discovered
from
whom
Joe
derived
the
conventional
temperature
of
*NL*
the
four
thousand
pounds
;
but
it
appeared
to
make
the
sum
of
money
more
*NL*
to
him
,
and
he
had
a
manifest
relish
in
insisting
on
its
being
cool
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
account
gave
me
great
joy
,
as
it
perfected
the
only
good
thing
I
*NL*
had
done
.
I
asked
Joe
whether
he
had
heard
if
any
of
the
other
relations
*NL*
had
any
legacies
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Sarah
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
she
have
twenty-five

*NL*

,
on

's
the

of

beasts

old
*NL*
chap
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Camels
?
''
said
I
,
wondering
why
he
could
possibly
want
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
nodded
.
``
Mrs.
Camels
,
''
by
which
I
presently
understood
he
meant
*NL*
Camilla
,
``
she
have
five
pound

rushlights
to
put
her
in
*NL*
spirits
when
she
wake
up
in
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
accuracy
of
these
recitals
was
sufficiently
obvious
to
me
,
to
give
*NL*
me
great
confidence
in
Joe
's
information
.
``
And
now
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
you
*NL*
ai
n't

I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

grant
you
,
but

said
*NL*
Joe
,
apologetically
;
``

And
wotsume'er
*NL*
the
failings
on
his
part

he
were

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it

has
been
broken
into
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
;
``
and
they
took
his
till
,
and
they
took
his
*NL*
cash-box
,
and
they
drinked
his
wine
,
and
they
partook
of
his
wittles
,
*NL*
and
they
slapped
his
face
,
and
they
pulled
his
nose
,
and
they
tied
him
*NL*
up
to
his
bedpust

and
they
giv

him
a

and
they
stuffed

But
he
knowed
*NL*

and
Orlick

county
jail

''
*NL*
*NL*
By
these
approaches
we
arrived
at
unrestricted
conversation
.
I
was
slow
*NL*
to
gain
strength
,
but
I
did
slowly
and
surely
become
less
weak
,
and
Joe
*NL*
stayed
with
me
,
and
I
fancied
I
was
little
Pip
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
tenderness
of
Joe
was
so
beautifully
proportioned
to
my
need
,
*NL*
that
I
was
like
a
child
in
his
hands
.
He
would
sit
and
talk
to
me
in
the
*NL*
old
confidence
,
and
with
the
old
simplicity
,
and
in
the
old
unassertive
*NL*
protecting
way
,
so
that
I
would
half
believe
that
all
my
life
since
the
*NL*
days
of
the
old
kitchen
was
one
of
the
mental
troubles
of
the
fever
that
*NL*
was
gone
.
He
did
everything
for
me
except
the
household
work
,
for
which
*NL*
he
had
engaged
a
very
decent
woman
,
after
paying
off
the
laundress
on
*NL*
his
first
arrival
.
``
Which
I
do
assure
you
,
Pip
,
''
he
would
often
say
,
in
*NL*
explanation
of
that
liberty
;
``
I
found
her
a
tapping
the
spare
bed
,
like
*NL*
a
cask
of
beer
,
and
drawing
off
the
feathers
in
a
bucket
,
for
sale
.
*NL*
Which
she
would
have
tapped
yourn
next
,
and
draw
'd
it
off
with
you
a
*NL*
laying
on
it
,
and
was
then
a
carrying
away
the
coals
gradiwally
in
*NL*
the
soup-tureen
and
wegetable-dishes
,
and
the
wine
and
spirits
in
your
*NL*
Wellington
boots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
forward
to
the
day
when
I
should
go
out
for
a
ride
,
as
we
had
*NL*
once
looked
forward
to
the
day
of
my
apprenticeship
.
And
when
the
day
*NL*
came
,
and
an
open
carriage
was
got
into
the
Lane
,
Joe
wrapped
me
up
,
*NL*
took
me
in
his
arms
,
carried
me
down
to
it
,
and
put
me
in
,
as
if
I
were
*NL*
still
the
small
helpless
creature
to
whom
he
had
so
abundantly
given
of
*NL*
the
wealth
of
his
great
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Joe
got
in
beside
me
,
and
we
drove
away
together
into
the
country
,
*NL*
where
the
rich
summer
growth
was
already
on
the
trees
and
on
the
grass
,
*NL*
and
sweet
summer
scents
filled
all
the
air
.
The
day
happened
to
be
*NL*
Sunday
,
and
when
I
looked
on
the
loveliness
around
me
,
and
thought
*NL*
how
it
had
grown
and
changed
,
and
how
the
little
wild-flowers
had
been
*NL*
forming
,
and
the
voices
of
the
birds
had
been
strengthening
,
by
day
and
*NL*
by
night
,
under
the
sun
and
under
the
stars
,
while
poor
I
lay
burning
*NL*
and
tossing
on
my
bed
,
the
mere
remembrance
of
having
burned
and
tossed
*NL*
there
came
like
a
check
upon
my
peace
.
But
when
I
heard
the
Sunday
*NL*
bells
,
and
looked
around
a
little
more
upon
the
outspread
beauty
,
I
felt
*NL*
that
I
was
not
nearly
thankful
enough
,
--
that
I
was
too
weak
yet
to
be
*NL*
even
that
,
--
and
I
laid
my
head
on
Joe
's
shoulder
,
as
I
had
laid
it
long
*NL*
ago
when
he
had
taken
me
to
the
Fair
or
where
not
,
and
it
was
too
much
*NL*
for
my
young
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
composure
came
to
me
after
a
while
,
and
we
talked
as
we
used
*NL*
to
talk
,
lying
on
the
grass
at
the
old
Battery
.
There
was
no
change
*NL*
whatever
in
Joe
.
Exactly
what
he
had
been
in
my
eyes
then
,
he
was
in
my
*NL*
eyes
still
;
just
as
simply
faithful
,
and
as
simply
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
back
again
,
and
he
lifted
me
out
,
and
carried
me
--
so
*NL*
easily
!
--
across
the
court
and
up
the
stairs
,
I
thought
of
that
eventful
*NL*
Christmas
Day
when
he
had
carried
me
over
the
marshes
.
We
had
not
yet
*NL*
made
any
allusion
to
my
change
of
fortune
,
nor
did
I
know
how
much
of
*NL*
my
late
history
he
was
acquainted
with
.
I
was
so
doubtful
of
myself
now
,
*NL*
and
put
so
much
trust
in
him
,
that
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
whether
I
*NL*
ought
to
refer
to
it
when
he
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
,
Joe
,
''
I
asked
him
that
evening
,
upon
further
*NL*
consideration
,
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
at
the
window
,
``
who
my
patron
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heerd
,
''
returned
Joe
,
``
as
it
were
not
Miss
Havisham
,
old
chap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
who
it
was
,
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
I
heerd
as
it
were
a
person
what

you
*NL*

at
the
Jolly
Bargemen
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Astonishing
!
''
said
Joe
,
in
the
placidest
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
that
he
was
dead
,
Joe
?
''
I
presently
asked
,
with
increasing
*NL*
diffidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
Him
as
sent
the
bank-notes
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Joe
,
after
meditating
a
long
time
,
and
looking
rather
*NL*
evasively
at
the
window-seat
,
``
as
I
did
hear
tell
that
how
he
were
*NL*
something
or
another
in
a
general
way
in
that
direction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
anything
of
his
circumstances
,
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
partickler
,
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
like
to
hear
,
Joe
--
''
I
was
beginning
,
when
Joe
got
up
and
*NL*
came
to
my
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookee
here
,
old
chap
,
''
said
Joe
,
bending
over
me
.
``
Ever
the
best
of
*NL*
friends
;
ai
n't
us
,
Pip
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
ashamed
to
answer
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wery
good
,
then
,
''
said
Joe
,
as
if
I
had
answered
;
``
that
's
all
right
;
*NL*
that
's
agreed
upon

Then
why
go
into
subjects

as
*NL*
betwixt

must
be

There
's
subjects
enough
*NL*
as
betwixt
two
sech
,
without
onnecessary
ones
.
Lord
!
To
think
of
your
*NL*
poor
sister
and
her
Rampages
!
And
do
n't
you
remember
Tickler
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
indeed
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookee
here
,
old
chap
,
''
said
Joe
.
``
I
done
what
I
could
to
keep
you
*NL*
and
Tickler
in
sunders
,
but
my
power
were
not
always
fully
equal
to
my
*NL*
inclinations
.
For
when
your
poor
sister
had
a
mind
to
drop
into
you
,
it
*NL*
were
not
so
much
,
''
said
Joe
,
in
his
favorite
argumentative
way
,
``
that
*NL*
she
dropped
into
me
too
,
if
I
put
myself
in
opposition
to
her
,
but
that
*NL*
she
dropped
into
you
always
heavier
for
it
.
I
noticed
that
.
It
ai
n't
a
*NL*
grab
at
a
man

whisker
,
not
yet
a
shake

put

But
when
that

is
dropped
into
*NL*
heavier
for
that
grab
of
whisker

shaking
,
then
that
man
naterally
up

says
to
himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

I
observed
,
as
Joe
waited
for
me
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

Joe
assented
.
``
Is

right

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear

he
is
always

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Joe
,
``
then
abide
by
your

If
he

right

which
in
general
he

likely
wrong
-RRB-
,
he
's
right
when
he
says
*NL*
this
:
Supposing
ever
you
kep
any

when
you
*NL*
was
a

J.
Gargery
's
*NL*
power
to

Tickler
in
sunders
were
not
fully

this
light
,

I
should
*NL*
so
put
it

Both
of
which
,

said
Joe
,
quite
charmed
with
his
logical
*NL*
arrangement
,
``
being
done
,
now
this
to
you
a
true
friend

say
.
Namely
.
*NL*
You
must
n't
go
a
overdoing
on
it
,
but
you
must
have
your
supper
and
your
*NL*
wine
and
water
,
and
you
must
be
put
betwixt
the
sheets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
delicacy
with
which
Joe
dismissed
this
theme
,
and
the
sweet
tact
and
*NL*
kindness
with
which
Biddy
--
who
with
her
woman
's
wit
had
found
me
out
so
*NL*
soon
--
had
prepared
him
for
it
,
made
a
deep
impression
on
my
mind
.
But
*NL*
whether
Joe
knew
how
poor
I
was
,
and
how
my
great
expectations
had
*NL*
all
dissolved
,
like
our
own
marsh
mists
before
the
sun
,
I
could
not
*NL*
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
thing
in
Joe
that
I
could
not
understand
when
it
first
began
to
*NL*
develop
itself
,
but
which
I
soon
arrived
at
a
sorrowful
comprehension
*NL*
of
,
was
this
:
As
I
became
stronger
and
better
,
Joe
became
a
little
less
*NL*
easy
with
me
.
In
my
weakness
and
entire
dependence
on
him
,
the
dear
*NL*
fellow
had
fallen
into
the
old
tone
,
and
called
me
by
the
old
names
,
*NL*
the
dear
``
old
Pip
,
old
chap
,
''
that
now
were
music
in
my
ears
.
I
too
had
*NL*
fallen
into
the
old
ways
,
only
happy
and
thankful
that
he
let
me
.
But
,
*NL*
imperceptibly
,
though
I
held
by
them
fast
,
Joe
's
hold
upon
them
began
*NL*
to
slacken
;
and
whereas
I
wondered
at
this
,
at
first
,
I
soon
began
to
*NL*
understand
that
the
cause
of
it
was
in
me
,
and
that
the
fault
of
it
was
*NL*
all
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
!
Had
I
given
Joe
no
reason
to
doubt
my
constancy
,
and
to
think
that
*NL*
in
prosperity
I
should
grow
cold
to
him
and
cast
him
off
?
Had
I
given
*NL*
Joe
's
innocent
heart
no
cause
to
feel
instinctively
that
as
I
got
*NL*
stronger
,
his
hold
upon
me
would
be
weaker
,
and
that
he
had
better
*NL*
loosen
it
in
time
and
let
me
go
,
before
I
plucked
myself
away
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
third
or
fourth
occasion
of
my
going
out
walking
in
the
*NL*
Temple
Gardens
leaning
on
Joe
's
arm
,
that
I
saw
this
change
in
him
very
*NL*
plainly
.
We
had
been
sitting
in
the
bright
warm
sunlight
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
river
,
and
I
chanced
to
say
as
we
got
up
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
Joe
!
I
can
walk
quite
strongly
.
Now
,
you
shall
see
me
walk
back
by
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
do
not
overdo
it
,
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
;
``
but
I
shall
be
happy
fur
to
*NL*
see
you
able
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
word
grated
on
me
;
but
how
could
I
remonstrate
!
I
walked
no
*NL*
further
than
the
gate
of
the
gardens
,
and
then
pretended
to
be
*NL*
weaker
than
I
was
,
and
asked
Joe
for
his
arm
.
Joe
gave
it
me
,
but
was
*NL*
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
for
my
part
,
was
thoughtful
too
;
for
,
how
best
to
check
this
growing
*NL*
change
in
Joe
was
a
great
perplexity
to
my
remorseful
thoughts
.
That
I
*NL*
was
ashamed
to
tell
him
exactly
how
I
was
placed
,
and
what
I
had
come
*NL*
down
to
,
I
do
not
seek
to
conceal
;
but
I
hope
my
reluctance
was
not
*NL*
quite
an
unworthy
one
.
He
would
want
to
help
me
out
of
his
little
*NL*
savings
,
I
knew
,
and
I
knew
that
he
ought
not
to
help
me
,
and
that
I
*NL*
must
not
suffer
him
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
thoughtful
evening
with
both
of
us
.
But
,
before
we
went
to
*NL*
bed
,
I
had
resolved
that
I
would
wait
over
to-morrow
,
--
to-morrow
being
*NL*
Sunday
,
--
and
would
begin
my
new
course
with
the
new
week
.
On
Monday
*NL*
morning
I
would
speak
to
Joe
about
this
change
,
I
would
lay
aside
this
*NL*
last
vestige
of
reserve
,
I
would
tell
him
what
I
had
in
my
thoughts
*NL*
-LRB-
that
Secondly
,
not
yet
arrived
at
-RRB-
,
and
why
I
had
not
decided
to
go
*NL*
out
to
Herbert
,
and
then
the
change
would
be
conquered
for
ever
.
As
I
*NL*
cleared
,
Joe
cleared
,
and
it
seemed
as
though
he
had
sympathetically
*NL*
arrived
at
a
resolution
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
quiet
day
on
the
Sunday
,
and
we
rode
out
into
the
country
,
and
*NL*
then
walked
in
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
thankful
that
I
have
been
ill
,
Joe
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
old
Pip
,
old
chap
,
you
're
a
`
most
come
round
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
a
memorable
time
for
me
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Likeways
for
myself
,
sir
,
''
Joe
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
had
a
time
together
,
Joe
,
that
I
can
never
forget
.
There
were
*NL*
days
once
,
I
know
,
that
I
did
for
a
while
forget
;
but
I
never
shall
*NL*
forget
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pip
,
''
said
Joe
,
appearing
a
little
hurried
and
troubled
,
``
there
has
*NL*
been
larks
.
And
,
dear
sir
,
what
have
been
betwixt
us
--
have
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
night
,
when
I
had
gone
to
bed
,
Joe
came
into
my
room
,
as
he
had
done
*NL*
all
through
my
recovery
.
He
asked
me
if
I
felt
sure
that
I
was
as
well
*NL*
as
in
the
morning
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
Joe
,
quite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
always
a
getting
stronger
,
old
chap
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
Joe
,
steadily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
patted
the
coverlet
on
my
shoulder
with
his
great
good
hand
,
and
*NL*
said
,
in
what
I
thought
a
husky
voice
,
``
Good
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
up
in
the
morning
,
refreshed
and
stronger
yet
,
I
was
full
of
*NL*
my
resolution
to
tell
Joe
all
,
without
delay
.
I
would
tell
him
before
*NL*
breakfast
.
I
would
dress
at
once
and
go
to
his
room
and
surprise
him
;
*NL*
for
,
it
was
the
first
day
I
had
been
up
early
.
I
went
to
his
room
,
and
*NL*
he
was
not
there
.
Not
only
was
he
not
there
,
but
his
box
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hurried
then
to
the
breakfast-table
,
and
on
it
found
a
letter
.
These
*NL*
were
its
brief
contents
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
wishful
to
intrude
I
have
departured
fur
you
are
well
again
dear
*NL*
Pip
and
will
do
better
without
JO
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
P.S.
Ever
the
best
of
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enclosed
in
the
letter
was
a
receipt
for
the
debt
and
costs
on
which
I
*NL*
had
been
arrested
.
Down
to
that
moment
,
I
had
vainly
supposed
that
my
*NL*
creditor
had
withdrawn
,
or
suspended
proceedings
until
I
should
be
quite
*NL*
recovered
.
I
had
never
dreamed
of
Joe
's
having
paid
the
money
;
but
Joe
*NL*
had
paid
it
,
and
the
receipt
was
in
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
remained
for
me
now
,
but
to
follow
him
to
the
dear
old
forge
,
and
*NL*
there
to
have
out
my
disclosure
to
him
,
and
my
penitent
remonstrance
*NL*
with
him
,
and
there
to
relieve
my
mind
and
heart
of
that
reserved
*NL*
Secondly
,
which
had
begun
as
a
vague
something
lingering
in
my
thoughts
,
*NL*
and
had
formed
into
a
settled
purpose
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
purpose
was
,
that
I
would
go
to
Biddy
,
that
I
would
show
her
how
*NL*
humbled
and
repentant
I
came
back
,
that
I
would
tell
her
how
I
had
lost
*NL*
all
I
once
hoped
for
,
that
I
would
remind
her
of
our
old
confidences
in
*NL*
my
first
unhappy
time
.
Then
I
would
say
to
her
,
``
Biddy
,
I
think
you
once
*NL*
liked
me
very
well
,
when
my
errant
heart
,
even
while
it
strayed
away
*NL*
from
you
,
was
quieter
and
better
with
you
than
it
ever
has
been
since
.
*NL*
If
you
can
like
me
only
half
as
well
once
more
,
if
you
can
take
me
with
*NL*
all
my
faults
and
disappointments
on
my
head
,
if
you
can
receive
me
like
*NL*
a
forgiven
child
-LRB-
and
indeed
I
am
as
sorry
,
Biddy
,
and
have
as
much
need
*NL*
of
a
hushing
voice
and
a
soothing
hand
-RRB-
,
I
hope
I
am
a
little
worthier
*NL*
of
you
that
I
was
,
--
not
much
,
but
a
little
.
And
,
Biddy
,
it
shall
rest
*NL*
with
you
to
say
whether
I
shall
work
at
the
forge
with
Joe
,
or
whether
I
*NL*
shall
try
for
any
different
occupation
down
in
this
country
,
or
whether
*NL*
we
shall
go
away
to
a
distant
place
where
an
opportunity
awaits
me
which
*NL*
I
set
aside
,
when
it
was
offered
,
until
I
knew
your
answer
.
And
now
,
*NL*
dear
Biddy
,
if
you
can
tell
me
that
you
will
go
through
the
world
with
*NL*
me
,
you
will
surely
make
it
a
better
world
for
me
,
and
me
a
better
man
*NL*
for
it
,
and
I
will
try
hard
to
make
it
a
better
world
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
my
purpose
.
After
three
days
more
of
recovery
,
I
went
down
to
*NL*
the
old
place
to
put
it
in
execution
.
And
how
I
sped
in
it
is
all
I
have
*NL*
left
to
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
LVIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
tidings
of
my
high
fortunes
having
had
a
heavy
fall
had
got
down
*NL*
to
my
native
place
and
its
neighborhood
before
I
got
there
.
I
found
the
*NL*
Blue
Boar
in
possession
of
the
intelligence
,
and
I
found
that
it
made
a
*NL*
great
change
in
the
Boar
's
demeanour
.
Whereas
the
Boar
had
cultivated
*NL*
my
good
opinion
with
warm
assiduity
when
I
was
coming
into
property
,
*NL*
the
Boar
was
exceedingly
cool
on
the
subject
now
that
I
was
going
out
of
*NL*
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evening
when
I
arrived
,
much
fatigued
by
the
journey
I
had
so
*NL*
often
made
so
easily
.
The
Boar
could
not
put
me
into
my
usual
bedroom
,
*NL*
which
was
engaged
-LRB-
probably
by
some
one
who
had
expectations
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
could
only
assign
me
a
very
indifferent
chamber
among
the
pigeons
and
*NL*
post-chaises
up
the
yard
.
But
I
had
as
sound
a
sleep
in
that
lodging
as
*NL*
in
the
most
superior
accommodation
the
Boar
could
have
given
me
,
and
the
*NL*
quality
of
my
dreams
was
about
the
same
as
in
the
best
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
,
while
my
breakfast
was
getting
ready
,
I
strolled
*NL*
round
by
Satis
House
.
There
were
printed
bills
on
the
gate
and
on
bits
*NL*
of
carpet
hanging
out
of
the
windows
,
announcing
a
sale
by
auction
of
*NL*
the
Household
Furniture
and
Effects
,
next
week
.
The
House
itself
was
to
*NL*
be
sold
as
old
building
materials
,
and
pulled
down
.
LOT
1
was
marked
in
*NL*
whitewashed
knock-knee
letters
on
the
brew
house
;
LOT
2
on
that
part
of
*NL*
the
main
building
which
had
been
so
long
shut
up
.
Other
lots
were
marked
*NL*
off
on
other
parts
of
the
structure
,
and
the
ivy
had
been
torn
down
to
*NL*
make
room
for
the
inscriptions
,
and
much
of
it
trailed
low
in
the
dust
*NL*
and
was
withered
already
.
Stepping
in
for
a
moment
at
the
open
gate
,
and
*NL*
looking
around
me
with
the
uncomfortable
air
of
a
stranger
who
had
no
*NL*
business
there
,
I
saw
the
auctioneer
's
clerk
walking
on
the
casks
and
*NL*
telling
them
off
for
the
information
of
a
catalogue-compiler
,
pen
in
*NL*
hand
,
who
made
a
temporary
desk
of
the
wheeled
chair
I
had
so
often
*NL*
pushed
along
to
the
tune
of
Old
Clem
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
back
to
my
breakfast
in
the
Boar
's
coffee-room
,
I
found
Mr.
*NL*
Pumblechook
conversing
with
the
landlord
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
-LRB-
not
improved
*NL*
in
appearance
by
his
late
nocturnal
adventure
-RRB-
was
waiting
for
me
,
and
*NL*
addressed
me
in
the
following
terms
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
man
,
I
am
sorry
to
see
you
brought
low
.
But
what
else
could
be
*NL*
expected
!
what
else
could
be
expected
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
extended
his
hand
with
a
magnificently
forgiving
air
,
and
as
I
was
*NL*
broken
by
illness
and
unfit
to
quarrel
,
I
took
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
William
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
to
the
waiter
,
``
put
a
muffin
on
table
.
*NL*
And
has
it
come
to
this
!
Has
it
come
to
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
frowningly
sat
down
to
my
breakfast
.
Mr.
Pumblechook
stood
over
me
and
*NL*
poured
out
my
tea
--
before
I
could
touch
the
teapot
--
with
the
air
of
a
*NL*
benefactor
who
was
resolved
to
be
true
to
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
William
,
''
said
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
mournfully
,
``
put
the
salt
on
.
In
*NL*
happier
times
,
''
addressing
me
,
``
I
think
you
took
sugar
?
And
did
you
take
*NL*
milk
?
You
did
.
Sugar
and
milk
.
William
,
bring
a
watercress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
I
,
shortly
,
``
but
I
do
n't
eat
watercresses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
eat
'em
,
''
returned
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
sighing
and
nodding
*NL*
his
head
several
times
,
as
if
he
might
have
expected
that
,
and
as
if
*NL*
abstinence
from
watercresses
were
consistent
with
my
downfall
.
``
True
.
*NL*
The
simple
fruits
of
the
earth
.
No
.
You
need
n't
bring
any
,
William
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
on
with
my
breakfast
,
and
Mr.
Pumblechook
continued
to
stand
over
*NL*
me
,
staring
fishily
and
breathing
noisily
,
as
he
always
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
more
than
skin
and
bone
!
''
mused
Mr.
Pumblechook
,
aloud
.
``
And
yet
*NL*
when
he
went
from
here
-LRB-
I
may
say
with
my
blessing
-RRB-
,
and
I
spread
afore
*NL*
him
my
humble
store
,
like
the
Bee
,
he
was
as
plump
as
a
Peach
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
reminded
me
of
the
wonderful
difference
between
the
servile
manner
*NL*
in
which
he
had
offered
his
hand
in
my
new
prosperity
,
saying
,
``
May
I
?
''
*NL*
and
the
ostentatious
clemency
with
which
he
had
just
now
exhibited
the
*NL*
same
fat
five
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hah
!
''
he
went
on
,
handing
me
the
bread
and
butter
.
``
And
air
you
a
going
*NL*
to
Joseph
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
heaven
's
name
,
''
said
I
,
firing
in
spite
of
myself
,
``
what
does
it
*NL*
matter
to
you
where
I
am
going
?
Leave
that
teapot
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
worst
course
I
could
have
taken
,
because
it
gave
Pumblechook
*NL*
the
opportunity
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
young
man
,
''
said
he
,
releasing
the
handle
of
the
article
in
*NL*
question
,
retiring
a
step
or
two
from
my
table
,
and
speaking
for
the
*NL*
behoof
of
the
landlord
and
waiter
at
the
door
,
``
I
will
leave
that
teapot
*NL*
alone
.
You
are
right
,
young
man
.
For
once
you
are
right
.
I
forgit
myself
*NL*
when
I
take
such
an
interest
in
your
breakfast
,
as
to
wish
your
frame
,
*NL*
exhausted
by
the
debilitating
effects
of
prodigygality
,
to
be
stimilated
*NL*
by
the
`
olesome
nourishment
of
your
forefathers
.
And
yet
,
''
said
*NL*
Pumblechook
,
turning
to
the
landlord
and
waiter
,
and
pointing
me
out
at
*NL*
arm
's
length
,
``
this
is
him
as
I
ever
sported
with
in
his
days
of
happy
*NL*
infancy
!
Tell
me
not
it
can
not
be
;
I
tell
you
this
is
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
low
murmur
from
the
two
replied
.
The
waiter
appeared
to
be
*NL*
particularly
affected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
him
,
''
said
Pumblechook
,
``
as
I
have
rode
in
my
shay-cart
.
This
*NL*
is
him
as
I
have
seen
brought
up
by
hand
.
This
is
him
untoe
the
sister
*NL*
of
which
I
was
uncle
by
marriage
,
as
her
name
was
Georgiana
M'ria
from
*NL*
her
own
mother
,
let
him
deny
it
if
he
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
seemed
convinced
that
I
could
not
deny
it
,
and
that
it
gave
*NL*
the
case
a
black
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
man
,
''
said
Pumblechook
,
screwing
his
head
at
me
in
the
old
*NL*
fashion
,
``
you
air
a
going
to
Joseph
.
What
does
it
matter
to
me
,
you
*NL*
ask
me
,
where
you
air
a
going
?
I
say
to
you
,
Sir
,
you
air
a
going
to
*NL*
Joseph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
coughed
,
as
if
he
modestly
invited
me
to
get
over
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Pumblechook
,
and
all
this
with
a
most
exasperating
air
*NL*
of
saying
in
the
cause
of
virtue
what
was
perfectly
convincing
and
*NL*
conclusive
,
``
I
will
tell
you
what
to
say
to
Joseph
.
Here
is
Squires
of
*NL*
the
Boar
present
,
known
and
respected
in
this
town
,
and
here
is
William
,
*NL*
which
his
father
's
name
was
Potkins
if
I
do
not
deceive
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
,
sir
,
''
said
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
their
presence

''
pursued
Pumblechook
,
``
I
will
tell
you

young

man

what

Says
you

Joseph

I
have
this

will
name
no

Joseph

so
they
are
pleased
to
call
him
up
town

and
I
have
*NL*
seen
that
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
I
do

see
him
here

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
that
likewise
,
''
retorted
Pumblechook
.
``
Say
you
said
that
,
and
even
*NL*
Joseph
will
probably
betray
surprise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
quite
mistake
him

said
I.
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

Pumblechook
went
on
,
''
`
Joseph
,
I
have
seen
that
man
,
and
*NL*
that
man
bears
you
no
malice
and
bears
me
no
malice
.
He
knows
your
*NL*
character
,
Joseph
,
and
is
well
acquainted
with
your
pig-headedness
and
*NL*
ignorance
;
and
he
knows
my
character
,
Joseph
,
and
he
knows
my
want
of

gratitoode
.
Yes
,
Joseph
,

says
you
,
''
here
Pumblechook
shook
his
head
and
*NL*
hand
at
me
,
''

he
knows
my
total
deficiency
of
common
human
gratitoode

*NL*
He
knows
it
,
Joseph

as
none
can
.
You
do
not
know
it
,
Joseph
,
having
no
*NL*
call
to
know
it
,
but
that
man
do
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Windy
donkey
as
he
was
,
it
really
amazed
me
that
he
could
have
the
face
*NL*
to
talk
thus
to
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Says
you
,
`
Joseph
,
he
gave
me
a
little
message
,
which
I
will
now
*NL*
repeat
.
It
was
that
,
in
my
being
brought
low
,
he
saw
the
finger
of
*NL*
Providence
.
He
knowed
that
finger
when
he
saw
Joseph
,
and
he
saw
it
*NL*
plain
.
It
pinted
out
this
writing
,
Joseph
.
Reward
of
ingratitoode
to
his
*NL*
earliest
benefactor
,
and
founder
of
fortun
's
.
But
that
man
said
he
did
*NL*
not
repent
of
what
he
had
done
,
Joseph
.
Not
at
all
.
It
was
right
to
do
*NL*
it
,
it
was
kind
to
do
it
,
it
was
benevolent
to
do
it
,
and
he
would
do
it
*NL*
again
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
pity
,
''
said
I
,
scornfully
,
as
I
finished
my
interrupted
breakfast
,
*NL*
``
that
the
man
did
not
say
what
he
had
done
and
would
do
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Squires
of
the
Boar
!
''
Pumblechook
was
now
addressing
the
landlord
,
``
and
*NL*
William
!
I
have
no
objections
to
your
mentioning
,
either
up
town
or
down
*NL*
town
,
if
such
should
be
your
wishes
,
that
it
was
right
to
do
it
,
kind
to
*NL*
do
it
,
benevolent
to
do
it
,
and
that
I
would
do
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
those
words
the
Impostor
shook
them
both
by
the
hand
,
with
an
air
,
*NL*
and
left
the
house
;
leaving
me
much
more
astonished
than
delighted
by
*NL*
the
virtues
of
that
same
indefinite
``
it
.
''
I
was
not
long
after
him
in
*NL*
leaving
the
house
too
,
and
when
I
went
down
the
High
Street
I
saw
him
*NL*
holding
forth
-LRB-
no
doubt
to
the
same
effect
-RRB-
at
his
shop
door
to
a
select
*NL*
group
,
who
honored
me
with
very
unfavorable
glances
as
I
passed
on
the
*NL*
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
it
was
only
the
pleasanter
to
turn
to
Biddy
and
to
Joe
,
whose
*NL*
great
forbearance
shone
more
brightly
than
before
,
if
that
could
be
,
*NL*
contrasted
with
this
brazen
pretender
.
I
went
towards
them
slowly
,
for
*NL*
my
limbs
were
weak
,
but
with
a
sense
of
increasing
relief
as
I
drew
*NL*
nearer
to
them
,
and
a
sense
of
leaving
arrogance
and
untruthfulness
*NL*
further
and
further
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
June
weather
was
delicious
.
The
sky
was
blue
,
the
larks
were
soaring
*NL*
high
over
the
green
corn
,
I
thought
all
that
countryside
more
beautiful
*NL*
and
peaceful
by
far
than
I
had
ever
known
it
to
be
yet
.
Many
pleasant
*NL*
pictures
of
the
life
that
I
would
lead
there
,
and
of
the
change
for
the
*NL*
better
that
would
come
over
my
character
when
I
had
a
guiding
spirit
at
*NL*
my
side
whose
simple
faith
and
clear
home
wisdom
I
had
proved
,
beguiled
*NL*
my
way
.
They
awakened
a
tender
emotion
in
me
;
for
my
heart
was
softened
*NL*
by
my
return
,
and
such
a
change
had
come
to
pass
,
that
I
felt
like
one
*NL*
who
was
toiling
home
barefoot
from
distant
travel
,
and
whose
wanderings
*NL*
had
lasted
many
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
schoolhouse
where
Biddy
was
mistress
I
had
never
seen
;
but
,
the
*NL*
little
roundabout
lane
by
which
I
entered
the
village
,
for
quietness
'
*NL*
sake
,
took
me
past
it
.
I
was
disappointed
to
find
that
the
day
was
a
*NL*
holiday
;
no
children
were
there
,
and
Biddy
's
house
was
closed
.
Some
*NL*
hopeful
notion
of
seeing
her
,
busily
engaged
in
her
daily
duties
,
before
*NL*
she
saw
me
,
had
been
in
my
mind
and
was
defeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
forge
was
a
very
short
distance
off
,
and
I
went
towards
it
under
*NL*
the
sweet
green
limes
,
listening
for
the
clink
of
Joe
's
hammer
.
Long
*NL*
after
I
ought
to
have
heard
it
,
and
long
after
I
had
fancied
I
heard
it
*NL*
and
found
it
but
a
fancy
,
all
was
still
.
The
limes
were
there
,
and
the
*NL*
white
thorns
were
there
,
and
the
chestnut-trees
were
there
,
and
their
*NL*
leaves
rustled
harmoniously
when
I
stopped
to
listen
;
but
,
the
clink
of
*NL*
Joe
's
hammer
was
not
in
the
midsummer
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
fearing
,
without
knowing
why
,
to
come
in
view
of
the
forge
,
I
saw
*NL*
it
at
last
,
and
saw
that
it
was
closed
.
No
gleam
of
fire
,
no
glittering
*NL*
shower
of
sparks
,
no
roar
of
bellows
;
all
shut
up
,
and
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
house
was
not
deserted
,
and
the
best
parlor
seemed
to
be
in
use
,
*NL*
for
there
were
white
curtains
fluttering
in
its
window
,
and
the
window
*NL*
was
open
and
gay
with
flowers
.
I
went
softly
towards
it
,
meaning
to
peep
*NL*
over
the
flowers
,
when
Joe
and
Biddy
stood
before
me
,
arm
in
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Biddy
gave
a
cry
,
as
if
she
thought
it
was
my
apparition
,
but
*NL*
in
another
moment
she
was
in
my
embrace
.
I
wept
to
see
her
,
and
she
wept
*NL*
to
see
me
;
I
,
because
she
looked
so
fresh
and
pleasant
;
she
,
because
I
*NL*
looked
so
worn
and
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
dear
Biddy
,
how
smart
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
Pip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Joe
,
how
smart
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
old
Pip
,
old
chap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
both
of
them
,
from
one
to
the
other
,
and
then
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
wedding-day
!
''
cried
Biddy
,
in
a
burst
of
happiness
,
``
and
I
am
*NL*
married
to
Joe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
taken
me
into
the
kitchen
,
and
I
had
laid
my
head
down
on
*NL*
the
old
deal
table
.
Biddy
held
one
of
my
hands
to
her
lips
,
and
Joe
's
*NL*
restoring
touch
was
on
my
shoulder
.
``
Which
he
war
n't
strong
enough
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
fur
to
be
surprised
,
''
said
Joe
.
And
Biddy
said
,
``
I
ought
to
*NL*
have
thought
of
it
,
dear
Joe
,
but
I
was
too
happy
.
''
They
were
both
so
*NL*
overjoyed
to
see
me
,
so
proud
to
see
me
,
so
touched
by
my
coming
to
*NL*
them
,
so
delighted
that
I
should
have
come
by
accident
to
make
their
day
*NL*
complete
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
thought
was
one
of
great
thankfulness
that
I
had
never
breathed
*NL*
this
last
baffled
hope
to
Joe
.
How
often
,
while
he
was
with
me
in
my
*NL*
illness
,
had
it
risen
to
my
lips
!
How
irrevocable
would
have
been
his
*NL*
knowledge
of
it
,
if
he
had
remained
with
me
but
another
hour
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
have
the
best
husband
in
the
whole
world
,
*NL*
and
if
you
could
have
seen
him
by
my
bed
you
would
have
--
But
no
,
you
*NL*
could
n't
love
him
better
than
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
could
n't
indeed
,
''
said
Biddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
dear
Joe
,
you
have
the
best
wife
in
the
whole
world
,
and
she
will
*NL*
make
you
as
happy
as
even
you
deserve
to
be
,
you
dear
,
good
,
noble
Joe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
looked
at
me
with
a
quivering
lip
,
and
fairly
put
his
sleeve
before
*NL*
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Joe
and
Biddy
both
,
as
you
have
been
to
church
to-day
,
and
are
in
*NL*
charity
and
love
with
all
mankind
,
receive
my
humble
thanks
for
all
you
*NL*
have
done
for
me
,
and
all
I
have
so
ill
repaid
!
And
when
I
say
that
I
am
*NL*
going
away
within
the
hour
,
for
I
am
soon
going
abroad
,
and
that
I
shall
*NL*
never
rest
until
I
have
worked
for
the
money
with
which
you
have
kept
me
*NL*
out
of
prison
,
and
have
sent
it
to
you
,
do
n't
think
,
dear
Joe
and
Biddy
,
*NL*
that
if
I
could
repay
it
a
thousand
times
over
,
I
suppose
I
could
cancel
*NL*
a
farthing
of
the
debt
I
owe
you
,
or
that
I
would
do
so
if
I
could
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
melted
by
these
words
,
and
both
entreated
me
to
say
no
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
say
more
.
Dear
Joe
,
I
hope
you
will
have
children
to
love
,
*NL*
and
that
some
little
fellow
will
sit
in
this
chimney-corner
of
a
winter
*NL*
night
,
who
may
remind
you
of
another
little
fellow
gone
out
of
it
for
*NL*
ever
.
Do
n't
tell
him
,
Joe
,
that
I
was
thankless
;
do
n't
tell
him
,
Biddy
,
*NL*
that
I
was
ungenerous
and
unjust
;
only
tell
him
that
I
honored
you
both
,
*NL*
because
you
were
both
so
good
and
true
,
and
that
,
as
your
child
,
I
said
*NL*
it
would
be
natural
to
him
to
grow
up
a
much
better
man
than
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ai
n't

said
Joe
,
from
behind
his
sleeve
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now

both

Pray

me
hear

say
the
words

that
I
may
carry
the
sound
of

away
with

then

I
shall
be
able

*NL*
*NL*
``

echoed
Biddy

``

*NL*
good-bye

*NL*
I
sold
all
I
had
,
and
put
aside
as
much
as
I
could
,
for
a
composition
*NL*
with
my
creditors
,
--
who
gave
me
ample
time
to
pay
them
in
full
,
--
and
I
*NL*
went
out
and
joined
Herbert
.
Within
a
month
,
I
had
quitted
England
,
*NL*
and
within
two
months
I
was
clerk
to
Clarriker
and
Co.
,
and
within
four
*NL*
months
I
assumed
my
first
undivided
responsibility
.
For
the
beam
across
*NL*
the
parlor
ceiling
at
Mill
Pond
Bank
had
then
ceased
to
tremble
under
*NL*
old
Bill
Barley
's
growls
and
was
at
peace
,
and
Herbert
had
gone
away
to
*NL*
marry
Clara
,
and
I
was
left
in
sole
charge
of
the
Eastern
Branch
until
*NL*
he
brought
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
a
year
went
round
before
I
was
a
partner
in
the
House
;
but
I
lived
*NL*
happily
with
Herbert
and
his
wife
,
and
lived
frugally
,
and
paid
my
*NL*
debts
,
and
maintained
a
constant
correspondence
with
Biddy
and
Joe
.
It
*NL*
was
not
until
I
became
third
in
the
Firm
,
that
Clarriker
betrayed
me
to
*NL*
Herbert
;
but
he
then
declared
that
the
secret
of
Herbert
's
partnership
*NL*
had
been
long
enough
upon
his
conscience
,
and
he
must
tell
it
.
So
he
*NL*
told
it
,
and
Herbert
was
as
much
moved
as
amazed
,
and
the
dear
fellow
*NL*
and
I
were
not
the
worse
friends
for
the
long
concealment
.
I
must
not
*NL*
leave
it
to
be
supposed
that
we
were
ever
a
great
House
,
or
that
we
made
*NL*
mints
of
money
.
We
were
not
in
a
grand
way
of
business
,
but
we
had
a
*NL*
good
name
,
and
worked
for
our
profits
,
and
did
very
well
.
We
owed
so
*NL*
much
to
Herbert
's
ever
cheerful
industry
and
readiness
,
that
I
often
*NL*
wondered
how
I
had
conceived
that
old
idea
of
his
inaptitude
,
until
I
*NL*
was
one
day
enlightened
by
the
reflection
,
that
perhaps
the
inaptitude
*NL*
had
never
been
in
him
at
all
,
but
had
been
in
me
.

Chapter
LIX
*NL*
*NL*
For
eleven
years
,
I
had
not
seen
Joe
nor
Biddy
with
my
bodily
*NL*
eyes
,
--
though
they
had
both
been
often
before
my
fancy
in
the
*NL*
East
,
--
when
,
upon
an
evening
in
December
,
an
hour
or
two
after
dark
,
I
*NL*
laid
my
hand
softly
on
the
latch
of
the
old
kitchen
door
.
I
touched
it
*NL*
so
softly
that
I
was
not
heard
,
and
looked
in
unseen
.
There
,
smoking
his
*NL*
pipe
in
the
old
place
by
the
kitchen
firelight
,
as
hale
and
as
strong
as
*NL*
ever
,
though
a
little
gray
,
sat
Joe
;
and
there
,
fenced
into
the
corner
*NL*
with
Joe
's
leg
,
and
sitting
on
my
own
little
stool
looking
at
the
fire
,
*NL*
was
--
I
again
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
giv
'
him
the
name
of
Pip
for
your
sake
,
dear
old
chap
,
''
said
Joe
,
*NL*
delighted
,
when
I
took
another
stool
by
the
child
's
side
-LRB-
but
I
did
not
*NL*
rumple
his
hair
-RRB-
,
``
and
we
hoped
he
might
grow
a
little
bit
like
you
,
and
*NL*
we
think
he
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
so
too
,
and
I
took
him
out
for
a
walk
next
morning
,
and
we
*NL*
talked
immensely
,
understanding
one
another
to
perfection
.
And
I
took
*NL*
him
down
to
the
churchyard
,
and
set
him
on
a
certain
tombstone
there
,
*NL*
and
he
showed
me
from
that
elevation
which
stone
was
sacred
to
the
*NL*
memory
of
Philip
Pirrip
,
late
of
this
Parish
,
and
Also
Georgiana
,
Wife
*NL*
of
the
Above
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biddy
,
''
said
I
,
when
I
talked
with
her
after
dinner
,
as
her
little
girl
*NL*
lay
sleeping
in
her
lap
,
``
you
must
give
Pip
to
me
one
of
these
days
;
or
*NL*
lend
him
,
at
all
events
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Biddy
,
gently
.
``
You
must
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
Herbert
and
Clara
say
,
but
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
,
Biddy
.
I
have
so
*NL*
settled
down
in
their
home
,
that
it
's
not
at
all
likely
.
I
am
already
*NL*
quite
an
old
bachelor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Biddy
looked
down
at
her
child
,
and
put
its
little
hand
to
her
lips
,
and
*NL*
then
put
the
good
matronly
hand
with
which
she
had
touched
it
into
mine
.
*NL*
There
was
something
in
the
action
,
and
in
the
light
pressure
of
Biddy
's
*NL*
wedding-ring
,
that
had
a
very
pretty
eloquence
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Pip
,
''
said
Biddy
,
``
you
are
sure
you
do
n't
fret
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
,
--
I
think
not
,
Biddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
as
an
old
,
old
friend
.
Have
you
quite
forgotten
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Biddy
,
I
have
forgotten
nothing
in
my
life
that
ever
had
a
*NL*
foremost
place
there
,
and
little
that
ever
had
any
place
there
.
But
that
*NL*
poor
dream
,
as
I
once
used
to
call
it
,
has
all
gone
by
,
Biddy
,
--
all
gone
*NL*
by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
I
knew
,
while
I
said
those
words
,
that
I
secretly
intended
*NL*
to
revisit
the
site
of
the
old
house
that
evening
,
alone
,
for
her
sake
.
*NL*
Yes
,
even
so
.
For
Estella
's
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
heard
of
her
as
leading
a
most
unhappy
life
,
and
as
being
*NL*
separated
from
her
husband
,
who
had
used
her
with
great
cruelty
,
and
who
*NL*
had
become
quite
renowned
as
a
compound
of
pride
,
avarice
,
brutality
,
*NL*
and
meanness
.
And
I
had
heard
of
the
death
of
her
husband
,
from
an
*NL*
accident
consequent
on
his
ill-treatment
of
a
horse
.
This
release
had
*NL*
befallen
her
some
two
years
before
;
for
anything
I
knew
,
she
was
married
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
early
dinner
hour
at
Joe
's
,
left
me
abundance
of
time
,
without
*NL*
hurrying
my
talk
with
Biddy
,
to
walk
over
to
the
old
spot
before
dark
.
*NL*
But
,
what
with
loitering
on
the
way
to
look
at
old
objects
and
to
think
*NL*
of
old
times
,
the
day
had
quite
declined
when
I
came
to
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
house
now
,
no
brewery
,
no
building
whatever
left
,
but
the
*NL*
wall
of
the
old
garden
.
The
cleared
space
had
been
enclosed
with
a
rough
*NL*
fence
,
and
looking
over
it
,
I
saw
that
some
of
the
old
ivy
had
struck
*NL*
root
anew
,
and
was
growing
green
on
low
quiet
mounds
of
ruin
.
A
gate
in
*NL*
the
fence
standing
ajar
,
I
pushed
it
open
,
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cold
silvery
mist
had
veiled
the
afternoon
,
and
the
moon
was
not
yet
*NL*
up
to
scatter
it
.
But
,
the
stars
were
shining
beyond
the
mist
,
and
the
*NL*
moon
was
coming
,
and
the
evening
was
not
dark
.
I
could
trace
out
where
*NL*
every
part
of
the
old
house
had
been
,
and
where
the
brewery
had
been
,
*NL*
and
where
the
gates
,
and
where
the
casks
.
I
had
done
so
,
and
was
looking
*NL*
along
the
desolate
garden
walk
,
when
I
beheld
a
solitary
figure
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
figure
showed
itself
aware
of
me
,
as
I
advanced
.
It
had
been
moving
*NL*
towards
me
,
but
it
stood
still
.
As
I
drew
nearer
,
I
saw
it
to
be
the
*NL*
figure
of
a
woman
.
As
I
drew
nearer
yet
,
it
was
about
to
turn
away
,
when
*NL*
it
stopped
,
and
let
me
come
up
with
it
.
Then
,
it
faltered
,
as
if
much
*NL*
surprised
,
and
uttered
my
name
,
and
I
cried
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Estella
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
greatly
changed
.
I
wonder
you
know
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
freshness
of
her
beauty
was
indeed
gone
,
but
its
indescribable
*NL*
majesty
and
its
indescribable
charm
remained
.
Those
attractions
in
it
,
*NL*
I
had
seen
before
;
what
I
had
never
seen
before
,
was
the
saddened
,
*NL*
softened
light
of
the
once
proud
eyes
;
what
I
had
never
felt
before
was
*NL*
the
friendly
touch
of
the
once
insensible
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
down
on
a
bench
that
was
near
,
and
I
said
,
``
After
so
many
years
,
*NL*
it
is
strange
that
we
should
thus
meet
again
,
Estella
,
here
where
our
*NL*
first
meeting
was
!
Do
you
often
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
been
here
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
began
to
rise
,
and
I
thought
of
the
placid
look
at
the
white
*NL*
ceiling
,
which
had
passed
away
.
The
moon
began
to
rise
,
and
I
thought
of
*NL*
the
pressure
on
my
hand
when
I
had
spoken
the
last
words
he
had
heard
on
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Estella
was
the
next
to
break
the
silence
that
ensued
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
very
often
hoped
and
intended
to
come
back
,
but
have
been
*NL*
prevented
by
many
circumstances
.
Poor
,
poor
old
place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
silvery
mist
was
touched
with
the
first
rays
of
the
moonlight
,
and
*NL*
the
same
rays
touched
the
tears
that
dropped
from
her
eyes
.
Not
knowing
*NL*
that
I
saw
them
,
and
setting
herself
to
get
the
better
of
them
,
she
said
*NL*
quietly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
wondering
,
as
you
walked
along
,
how
it
came
to
be
left
in
this
*NL*
condition
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Estella
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ground
belongs
to
me
.
It
is
the
only
possession
I
have
not
*NL*
relinquished
.
Everything
else
has
gone
from
me
,
little
by
little
,
but
I
*NL*
have
kept
this
.
It
was
the
subject
of
the
only
determined
resistance
I
*NL*
made
in
all
the
wretched
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
to
be
built
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
,
it
is
.
I
came
here
to
take
leave
of
it
before
its
change
.
And
*NL*
you
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
voice
of
touching
interest
to
a
wanderer
,
--
``
you
*NL*
live
abroad
still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
well
,
I
am
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
work
pretty
hard
for
a
sufficient
living
,
and
therefore
--
yes
,
I
do
*NL*
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
often
thought
of
you

said
Estella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
late
,
very
often

There
was
a
long
hard
time
when
I
kept
far
from
me
*NL*
the
remembrance
of
what
I
had
thrown
away
when
I
was
quite
ignorant
*NL*
of
its
worth
.
But
since
my
duty
has
not
been
incompatible
with
the
*NL*
admission
of
that
remembrance
,
I
have
given
it
a
place
in
my
heart

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
always
held
your
place
in
my
heart

I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
were
silent
again
until
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
little
thought
,

said
Estella
,
``
that
I
should
take
leave
of
you
in
*NL*
taking
leave
of
this
spot

I
am
very
glad
to
do
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
part
again

To

parting
is
a
painful
thing

To
me
,
*NL*
the
remembrance
of
our
last
parting
has
been
ever
mournful
and
painful

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
to
me

returned
Estella
,
very
earnestly
,
''
`
God
bless
you

God
forgive
you

And
if
you
could
say
that
to
me
then
,
you
will
not
*NL*
hesitate
to
say
that
to
me
now

now

when
suffering
has
been
stronger
*NL*
than
all
other
teaching

has
taught
me
to
understand
what
your
heart
*NL*
used
to
be
.
I
have
been
bent
and
broken
,

--
I
hope

into
a
better

Be
as
considerate

good

tell
me
we

friends

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
friends

said
I
,
rising
and
bending
over
her
,
as
she
rose
from
*NL*
the
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
continue
friends
apart

said
Estella

*NL*
*NL*
I
took
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
we
went
out
of
the
ruined
place
;
and
,
as
*NL*
the
morning
mists
had
risen
long
ago
when
I
first
left
the
forge
,
so
the
*NL*
evening
mists
were
rising
now
,
and
in
all
the
broad
expanse
of
tranquil
*NL*
light
they
showed
to
me

I
saw
no
shadow
of
another
parting
from
