I
*NL*
THE
ONE
THING
NEEDFUL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
NOW
,
what
I
want
is
,
Facts
.
Teach
these
boys
and
girls
nothing
but
*NL*
Facts
.
Facts
alone
are
wanted
in
life
.
Plant
nothing
else
,
and
root
out
*NL*
everything
else
.
You
can
only
form
the
minds
of
reasoning
animals
upon
*NL*
Facts
:
nothing
else
will
ever
be
of
any
service
to
them
.
This
is
the
*NL*
principle
on
which
I
bring
up
my
own
children
,
and
this
is
the
principle
*NL*
on
which
I
bring
up
these
children
.
Stick
to
Facts
,
sir
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
was
a
plain
,
bare
,
monotonous
vault
of
a
school-room
,
and
the
*NL*
speaker
's
square
forefinger
emphasized
his
observations
by
underscoring
*NL*
every
sentence
with
a
line
on
the
schoolmaster
's
sleeve
.
The
emphasis
*NL*
was
helped
by
the
speaker
's
square
wall
of
a
forehead
,
which
had
his
*NL*
eyebrows
for
its
base
,
while
his
eyes
found
commodious
cellarage
in
two
*NL*
dark
caves
,
overshadowed
by
the
wall
.
The
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
*NL*
speaker
's
mouth
,
which
was
wide
,
thin
,
and
hard
set
.
The
emphasis
was
*NL*
helped
by
the
speaker
's
voice
,
which
was
inflexible
,
dry
,
and
*NL*
dictatorial
.
The
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
speaker
's
hair
,
which
*NL*
bristled
on
the
skirts
of
his
bald
head
,
a
plantation
of
firs
to
keep
the
*NL*
wind
from
its
shining
surface
,
all
covered
with
knobs
,
like
the
crust
of
*NL*
a
plum
pie
,
as
if
the
head
had
scarcely
warehouse-room
for
the
hard
facts
*NL*
stored
inside
.
The
speaker
's
obstinate
carriage
,
square
coat
,
square
*NL*
legs
,
square
shoulders
,
--
nay
,
his
very
neckcloth
,
trained
to
take
him
by
*NL*
the
throat
with
an
unaccommodating
grasp
,
like
a
stubborn
fact
,
as
it
*NL*
was
,
--
all
helped
the
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
this
life
,
we
want
nothing
but
Facts
,
sir
;
nothing
but
Facts
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
speaker
,
and
the
schoolmaster
,
and
the
third
grown
person
present
,
*NL*
all
backed
a
little
,
and
swept
with
their
eyes
the
inclined
plane
of
*NL*
little
vessels
then
and
there
arranged
in
order
,
ready
to
have
imperial
*NL*
gallons
of
facts
poured
into
them
until
they
were
full
to
the
brim
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
MURDERING
THE
INNOCENTS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THOMAS
GRADGRIND
,
sir
.
A
man
of
realities
.
A
man
of
facts
and
*NL*
calculations
.
A
man
who
proceeds
upon
the
principle
that
two
and
two
are
*NL*
four
,
and
nothing
over
,
and
who
is
not
to
be
talked
into
allowing
for
*NL*
anything
over
.
Thomas
Gradgrind
,
sir
--
peremptorily
Thomas
--
Thomas
*NL*
Gradgrind
.
With
a
rule
and
a
pair
of
scales
,
and
the
multiplication
*NL*
table
always
in
his
pocket
,
sir
,
ready
to
weigh
and
measure
any
parcel
of
*NL*
human
nature
,
and
tell
you
exactly
what
it
comes
to
.
It
is
a
mere
*NL*
question
of
figures
,
a
case
of
simple
arithmetic
.
You
might
hope
to
get
*NL*
some
other
nonsensical
belief
into
the
head
of
George
Gradgrind
,
or
*NL*
Augustus
Gradgrind
,
or
John
Gradgrind
,
or
Joseph
Gradgrind
-LRB-
all
*NL*
supposititious
,
non-existent
persons
-RRB-
,
but
into
the
head
of
Thomas
*NL*
Gradgrind
--
no
,
sir
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
terms
Mr.
Gradgrind
always
mentally
introduced
himself
,
whether
*NL*
to
his
private
circle
of
acquaintance
,
or
to
the
public
in
general
.
In
*NL*
such
terms
,
no
doubt
,
substituting
the
words
`
boys
and
girls
,
'
for
`
sir
,
'
*NL*
Thomas
Gradgrind
now
presented
Thomas
Gradgrind
to
the
little
pitchers
*NL*
before
him
,
who
were
to
be
filled
so
full
of
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
as
he
eagerly
sparkled
at
them
from
the
cellarage
before
*NL*
mentioned
,
he
seemed
a
kind
of
cannon
loaded
to
the
muzzle
with
facts
,
*NL*
and
prepared
to
blow
them
clean
out
of
the
regions
of
childhood
at
one
*NL*
discharge
.
He
seemed
a
galvanizing
apparatus
,
too
,
charged
with
a
grim
*NL*
mechanical
substitute
for
the
tender
young
imaginations
that
were
to
be
*NL*
stormed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Girl
number
twenty
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
squarely
pointing
with
his
*NL*
square
forefinger
,
'
I
do
n't
know
that
girl
.
Who
is
that
girl
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sissy
Jupe
,
sir
,
'
explained
number
twenty
,
blushing
,
standing
up
,
and
*NL*
curtseying
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sissy
is
not
a
name
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
Do
n't
call
yourself
Sissy
.
*NL*
Call
yourself
Cecilia
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
father
as
calls
me
Sissy
,
sir
,
'
returned
the
young
girl
in
a
*NL*
trembling
voice
,
and
with
another
curtsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
he
has
no
business
to
do
it
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
Tell
him
he
*NL*
must
n't
.
Cecilia
Jupe
.
Let
me
see
.
What
is
your
father
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
belongs
to
the
horse-riding
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
frowned
,
and
waved
off
the
objectionable
calling
with
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
do
n't
want
to
know
anything
about
that
,
here
.
You
must
n't
tell
us
*NL*
about
that
,
here
.
Your
father
breaks
horses
,
do
n't
he
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
please
,
sir
,
when
they
can
get
any
to
break
,
they
do
break
horses
*NL*
in
the
ring
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
n't
tell
us
about
the
ring
,
here
.
Very
well
,
then
.
Describe
*NL*
your
father
as
a
horsebreaker
.
He
doctors
sick
horses
,
I
dare
say
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
yes
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
well
,
then
.
He
is
a
veterinary
surgeon
,
a
farrier
,
and
*NL*
horsebreaker
.
Give
me
your
definition
of
a
horse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Sissy
Jupe
thrown
into
the
greatest
alarm
by
this
demand
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
Girl
number
twenty
unable
to
define
a
horse
!
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
for
*NL*
the
general
behoof
of
all
the
little
pitchers
.
`
Girl
number
twenty
*NL*
possessed
of
no
facts
,
in
reference
to
one
of
the
commonest
of
animals
!
*NL*
Some
boy
's
definition
of
a
horse
.
Bitzer
,
yours
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
square
finger
,
moving
here
and
there
,
lighted
suddenly
on
Bitzer
,
*NL*
perhaps
because
he
chanced
to
sit
in
the
same
ray
of
sunlight
which
,
*NL*
darting
in
at
one
of
the
bare
windows
of
the
intensely
white-washed
room
,
*NL*
irradiated
Sissy
.
For
,
the
boys
and
girls
sat
on
the
face
of
the
*NL*
inclined
plane
in
two
compact
bodies
,
divided
up
the
centre
by
a
narrow
*NL*
interval
;
and
Sissy
,
being
at
the
corner
of
a
row
on
the
sunny
side
,
came
*NL*
in
for
the
beginning
of
a
sunbeam
,
of
which
Bitzer
,
being
at
the
corner
*NL*
of
a
row
on
the
other
side
,
a
few
rows
in
advance
,
caught
the
end
.
But
,
*NL*
whereas
the
girl
was
so
dark-eyed
and
dark-haired
,
that
she
seemed
to
*NL*
receive
a
deeper
and
more
lustrous
colour
from
the
sun
,
when
it
shone
*NL*
upon
her
,
the
boy
was
so
light-eyed
and
light-haired
that
the
self-same
*NL*
rays
appeared
to
draw
out
of
him
what
little
colour
he
ever
possessed
.
*NL*
His
cold
eyes
would
hardly
have
been
eyes
,
but
for
the
short
ends
of
*NL*
lashes
which
,
by
bringing
them
into
immediate
contrast
with
something
*NL*
paler
than
themselves
,
expressed
their
form
.
His
short-cropped
hair
*NL*
might
have
been
a
mere
continuation
of
the
sandy
freckles
on
his
forehead
*NL*
and
face
.
His
skin
was
so
unwholesomely
deficient
in
the
natural
tinge
,
*NL*
that
he
looked
as
though
,
if
he
were
cut
,
he
would
bleed
white
.
*NL*
*NL*

Mr.

*NL*
She
curtseyed
again
,
and
would
have
blushed
deeper
,
if
she
could
have
*NL*
blushed
deeper
than
she
had
blushed
all
this
time
.
Bitzer
,
after
rapidly
*NL*
blinking
at
Thomas
Gradgrind
with
both
eyes
at
once
,
and
so
catching
the
*NL*
light
upon
his
quivering
ends
of
lashes
that
they
looked
like
the
antennae
*NL*
of
busy
insects
,
put
his
knuckles
to
his
freckled
forehead
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
gentleman
now
stepped
forth
.
A
mighty
man
at
cutting
and
*NL*
drying
,
he
was
;
a
government
officer
;
in
his
way
-LRB-
and
in
most
other
*NL*
people
's
too
-RRB-
,
a
professed
pugilist
;
always
in
training
,
always
with
a
*NL*
system
to
force
down
the
general
throat
like
a
bolus
,
always
to
be
heard
*NL*
of
at
the
bar
of
his
little
Public-office
,
ready
to
fight
all
England
.
*NL*
To
continue
in
fistic
phraseology
,
he
had
a
genius
for
coming
up
to
the
*NL*
scratch
,
wherever
and
whatever
it
was
,
and
proving
himself
an
ugly
*NL*
customer
.
He
would
go
in
and
damage
any
subject
whatever
with
his
right
,
*NL*
follow
up
with
his
left
,
stop
,
exchange
,
counter
,
bore
his
opponent
-LRB-
he
*NL*
always
fought
All
England
-RRB-
to
the
ropes
,
and
fall
upon
him
neatly
.
He
*NL*
was
certain
to
knock
the
wind
out
of
common
sense
,
and
render
that
*NL*
unlucky
adversary
deaf
to
the
call
of
time
.
And
he
had
it
in
charge
from
*NL*
high
authority
to
bring
about
the
great
public-office
Millennium
,
when
*NL*
Commissioners
should
reign
upon
earth
.

`
Very
well
,
'
said
this
gentleman
,
briskly
smiling
,
and
folding
his
arms
.
*NL*
`
That
's
a
horse
.
Now
,
let
me
ask
you
girls
and
boys
,
Would
you
paper
a
*NL*
room
with
representations
of
horses
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
,
one
half
of
the
children
cried
in
chorus
,
`
Yes
,
sir
!
'
*NL*
Upon
which
the
other
half
,
seeing
in
the
gentleman
's
face
that
Yes
was
*NL*
wrong
,
cried
out
in
chorus
,
`
No
,
sir
!
'
--
as
the
custom
is
,
in
these
*NL*
examinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
,
No
.
Why
would
n't
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
pause
.
One
corpulent
slow
boy
,
with
a
wheezy
manner
of
breathing
,
*NL*
ventured
the
answer
,
Because
he
would
n't
paper
a
room
at
all
,
but
would
*NL*
paint
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
_
must
_
paper
it
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
rather
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
paper
it
,
'
said
Thomas
Gradgrind
,
`
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.
*NL*
Do
n't
tell
_
us
_
you
would
n't
paper
it
.
What
do
you
mean
,
boy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
explain
to
you
,
then
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
after
another
and
a
*NL*
dismal
pause
,
`
why
you
would
n't
paper
a
room
with
representations
of
*NL*
horses
.
Do
you
ever
see
horses
walking
up
and
down
the
sides
of
rooms
in
*NL*
reality
--
in
fact
?
Do
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
!
'
from
one
half
.
`
No
,
sir
!
'
from
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
no
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
with
an
indignant
look
at
the
wrong
*NL*
half
.
`
Why
,
then
,
you
are
not
to
see
anywhere
,
what
you
do
n't
see
in
*NL*
fact
;
you
are
not
to
have
anywhere
,
what
you
do
n't
have
in
fact
.
What
is
*NL*
called
Taste
,
is
only
another
name
for
Fact
.
'
Thomas
Gradgrind
nodded
*NL*
his
approbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
a
new
principle
,
a
discovery
,
a
great
discovery
,
'
said
the
*NL*
gentleman
.
`
Now
,
I
'll
try
you
again
.
Suppose
you
were
going
to
carpet
a
*NL*
room
.
Would
you
use
a
carpet
having
a
representation
of
flowers
upon
*NL*
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
being
a
general
conviction
by
this
time
that
`
No
,
sir
!
'
was
always
*NL*
the
right
answer
to
this
gentleman
,
the
chorus
of
NO
was
very
strong
.
*NL*
Only
a
few
feeble
stragglers
said
Yes
:
among
them
Sissy
Jupe
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Girl
number
twenty
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
smiling
in
the
calm
strength
of
*NL*
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sissy
blushed
,
and
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
you
would
carpet
your
room
--
or
your
husband
's
room
,
if
you
were
a
*NL*
grown
woman
,
and
had
a
husband
--
with
representations
of
flowers
,
would
*NL*
you
?
'
said
the
gentleman
.
`
Why
would
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
please
,
sir
,
I
am
very
fond
of
flowers
,
'
returned
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
is
that
why
you
would
put
tables
and
chairs
upon
them
,
and
have
*NL*
people
walking
over
them
with
heavy
boots
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
would
n't
hurt
them
,
sir
.
They
would
n't
crush
and
wither
,
if
you
*NL*
please
,
sir
.
They
would
be
the
pictures
of
what
was
very
pretty
and
*NL*
pleasant
,
and
I
would
fancy
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
ay
,
ay
!
But
you
must
n't
fancy
,
'
cried
the
gentleman
,
quite
elated
*NL*
by
coming
so
happily
to
his
point
.
`
That
's
it
!
You
are
never
to
fancy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
not
,
Cecilia
Jupe
,
'
Thomas
Gradgrind
solemnly
repeated
,
`
to
do
*NL*
anything
of
that
kind
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fact
,
fact
,
fact
!
'
said
the
gentleman
.
And
`
Fact
,
fact
,
fact
!
'
repeated
*NL*
Thomas
Gradgrind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
to
be
in
all
things
regulated
and
governed
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
*NL*
`
by
fact
.
We
hope
to
have
,
before
long
,
a
board
of
fact
,
composed
of
*NL*
commissioners
of
fact
,
who
will
force
the
people
to
be
a
people
of
fact
,
*NL*
and
of
nothing
but
fact
.
You
must
discard
the
word
Fancy
altogether
.
*NL*
You
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
You
are
not
to
have
,
in
any
object
of
*NL*
use
or
ornament
,
what
would
be
a
contradiction
in
fact
.
You
do
n't
walk
*NL*
upon
flowers
in
fact
;
you
can
not
be
allowed
to
walk
upon
flowers
in
*NL*
carpets
.
You
do
n't
find
that
foreign
birds
and
butterflies
come
and
*NL*
perch
upon
your
crockery
;
you
can
not
be
permitted
to
paint
foreign
birds
*NL*
and
butterflies
upon
your
crockery
.
You
never
meet
with
quadrupeds
going
*NL*
up
and
down
walls
;
you
must
not
have
quadrupeds
represented
upon
walls
.
*NL*
You
must
use
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
`
for
all
these
purposes
,
combinations
*NL*
and
modifications
-LRB-
in
primary
colours
-RRB-
of
mathematical
figures
which
are
*NL*
susceptible
of
proof
and
demonstration
.
This
is
the
new
discovery
.
This
*NL*
is
fact
.
This
is
taste
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
curtseyed
,
and
sat
down
.
She
was
very
young
,
and
she
looked
as
*NL*
if
she
were
frightened
by
the
matter-of-fact
prospect
the
world
afforded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
if
Mr.
M'Choakumchild
,
'
said
the
gentleman
,
`
will
proceed
to
give
*NL*
his
first
lesson
here
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
I
shall
be
happy
,
at
your
request
,
*NL*
to
observe
his
mode
of
procedure
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
was
much
obliged
.
`
Mr.
M'Choakumchild
,
we
only
wait
for
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
Mr.
M'Choakumchild
began
in
his
best
manner
.
He
and
some
one
hundred
*NL*
and
forty
other
schoolmasters
,
had
been
lately
turned
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
in
the
same
factory
,
on
the
same
principles
,
like
so
many
pianoforte
*NL*
legs
.
He
had
been
put
through
an
immense
variety
of
paces
,
and
had
*NL*
answered
volumes
of
head-breaking
questions
.
Orthography
,
etymology
,
*NL*
syntax
,
and
prosody
,
biography
,
astronomy
,
geography
,
and
general
*NL*
cosmography
,
the
sciences
of
compound
proportion
,
algebra
,
land-surveying
*NL*
and
levelling
,
vocal
music
,
and
drawing
from
models
,
were
all
at
the
ends
*NL*
of
his
ten
chilled
fingers
.
He
had
worked
his
stony
way
into
Her
*NL*
Majesty
's
most
Honourable
Privy
Council
's
Schedule
B
,
and
had
taken
the
*NL*
bloom
off
the
higher
branches
of
mathematics
and
physical
science
,
*NL*
French
,
German
,
Latin
,
and
Greek
.
He
knew
all
about
all
the
Water
Sheds
*NL*
of
all
the
world
-LRB-
whatever
they
are
-RRB-
,
and
all
the
histories
of
all
the
*NL*
peoples
,
and
all
the
names
of
all
the
rivers
and
mountains
,
and
all
the
*NL*
productions
,
manners
,
and
customs
of
all
the
countries
,
and
all
their
*NL*
boundaries
and
bearings
on
the
two
and
thirty
points
of
the
compass
.
Ah
,
*NL*
rather
overdone
,
M'Choakumchild
.
If
he
had
only
learnt
a
little
less
,
*NL*
how
infinitely
better
he
might
have
taught
much
more
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
work
in
this
preparatory
lesson
,
not
unlike
Morgiana
in
the
*NL*
Forty
Thieves
:
looking
into
all
the
vessels
ranged
before
him
,
one
after
*NL*
another
,
to
see
what
they
contained
.
Say
,
good
M'Choakumchild
.
When
*NL*
from
thy
boiling
store
,
thou
shalt
fill
each
jar
brim
full
by-and-by
,
*NL*
dost
thou
think
that
thou
wilt
always
kill
outright
the
robber
Fancy
*NL*
lurking
within
--
or
sometimes
only
maim
him
and
distort
him
!

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
A
LOOPHOLE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
GRADGRIND
walked
homeward
from
the
school
,
in
a
state
of
considerable
*NL*
satisfaction
.
It
was
his
school
,
and
he
intended
it
to
be
a
model
.
He
*NL*
intended
every
child
in
it
to
be
a
model
--
just
as
the
young
Gradgrinds
*NL*
were
all
models
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
five
young
Gradgrinds
,
and
they
were
models
every
one
.
They
*NL*
had
been
lectured
at
,
from
their
tenderest
years
;
coursed
,
like
little
*NL*
hares
.
Almost
as
soon
as
they
could
run
alone
,
they
had
been
made
to
run
*NL*
to
the
lecture-room
.
The
first
object
with
which
they
had
an
*NL*
association
,
or
of
which
they
had
a
remembrance
,
was
a
large
black
board
*NL*
with
a
dry
Ogre
chalking
ghastly
white
figures
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
they
knew
,
by
name
or
nature
,
anything
about
an
Ogre
Fact
*NL*
forbid
!
I
only
use
the
word
to
express
a
monster
in
a
lecturing
castle
,
*NL*
with
Heaven
knows
how
many
heads
manipulated
into
one
,
taking
childhood
*NL*
captive
,
and
dragging
it
into
gloomy
statistical
dens
by
the
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
little
Gradgrind
had
ever
seen
a
face
in
the
moon
;
it
was
up
in
the
*NL*
moon
before
it
could
speak
distinctly
.
No
little
Gradgrind
had
ever
*NL*
learnt
the
silly
jingle
,
Twinkle
,
twinkle
,
little
star
;
how
I
wonder
what
*NL*
you
are
!
No
little
Gradgrind
had
ever
known
wonder
on
the
subject
,
each
*NL*
little
Gradgrind
having
at
five
years
old
dissected
the
Great
Bear
like
a
*NL*
Professor
Owen
,
and
driven
Charles
's
Wain
like
a
locomotive
*NL*
engine-driver
.
No
little
Gradgrind
had
ever
associated
a
cow
in
a
field
*NL*
with
that
famous
cow
with
the
crumpled
horn
who
tossed
the
dog
who
*NL*
worried
the
cat
who
killed
the
rat
who
ate
the
malt
,
or
with
that
yet
*NL*
more
famous
cow
who
swallowed
Tom
Thumb
:
it
had
never
heard
of
those
*NL*
celebrities
,
and
had
only
been
introduced
to
a
cow
as
a
graminivorous
*NL*
ruminating
quadruped
with
several
stomachs
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
matter-of-fact
home
,
which
was
called
Stone
Lodge
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
*NL*
directed
his
steps
.
He
had
virtually
retired
from
the
wholesale
hardware
*NL*
trade
before
he
built
Stone
Lodge
,
and
was
now
looking
about
for
a
*NL*
suitable
opportunity
of
making
an
arithmetical
figure
in
Parliament
.
*NL*
Stone
Lodge
was
situated
on
a
moor
within
a
mile
or
two
of
a
great
*NL*
town
--
called
Coketown
in
the
present
faithful
guide-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
regular
feature
on
the
face
of
the
country
,
Stone
Lodge
was
.
Not
*NL*
the
least
disguise
toned
down
or
shaded
off
that
uncompromising
fact
in
*NL*
the
landscape
.
A
great
square
house
,
with
a
heavy
portico
darkening
the
*NL*
principal
windows
,
as
its
master
's
heavy
brows
overshadowed
his
eyes
.
A
*NL*
calculated
,
cast
up
,
balanced
,
and
proved
house
.
Six
windows
on
this
*NL*
side
of
the
door
,
six
on
that
side
;
a
total
of
twelve
in
this
wing
,
a
*NL*
total
of
twelve
in
the
other
wing
;
four-and-twenty
carried
over
to
the
*NL*
back
wings
.
A
lawn
and
garden
and
an
infant
avenue
,
all
ruled
straight
*NL*
like
a
botanical
account-book
.
Gas
and
ventilation
,
drainage
and
*NL*
water-service
,
all
of
the
primest
quality
.
Iron
clamps
and
girders
,
*NL*
fire-proof
from
top
to
bottom
;
mechanical
lifts
for
the
housemaids
,
with
*NL*
all
their
brushes
and
brooms
;
everything
that
heart
could
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
?
Well
,
I
suppose
so
.
The
little
Gradgrinds
had
cabinets
in
*NL*
various
departments
of
science
too
.
They
had
a
little
conchological
*NL*
cabinet
,
and
a
little
metallurgical
cabinet
,
and
a
little
mineralogical
*NL*
cabinet
;
and
the
specimens
were
all
arranged
and
labelled
,
and
the
bits
*NL*
of
stone
and
ore
looked
as
though
they
might
have
been
broken
from
the
*NL*
parent
substances
by
those
tremendously
hard
instruments
their
own
names
;
*NL*
and
,
to
paraphrase
the
idle
legend
of
Peter
Piper
,
who
had
never
found
*NL*
his
way
into
their
nursery
,
If
the
greedy
little
Gradgrinds
grasped
at
*NL*
more
than
this
,
what
was
it
for
good
gracious
goodness
'
sake
,
that
the
*NL*
greedy
little
Gradgrinds
grasped
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
Their
father
walked
on
in
a
hopeful
and
satisfied
frame
of
mind
.
He
was
*NL*
an
affectionate
father
,
after
his
manner
;
but
he
would
probably
have
*NL*
described
himself
-LRB-
if
he
had
been
put
,
like
Sissy
Jupe
,
upon
a
*NL*
definition
-RRB-
as
`
an
eminently
practical
'
father
.
He
had
a
particular
*NL*
pride
in
the
phrase
eminently
practical
,
which
was
considered
to
have
a
*NL*
special
application
to
him
.
Whatsoever
the
public
meeting
held
in
*NL*
Coketown
,
and
whatsoever
the
subject
of
such
meeting
,
some
Coketowner
was
*NL*
sure
to
seize
the
occasion
of
alluding
to
his
eminently
practical
friend
*NL*
Gradgrind
.
This
always
pleased
the
eminently
practical
friend
.
He
knew
*NL*
it
to
be
his
due
,
but
his
due
was
acceptable
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
reached
the
neutral
ground
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
town
,
which
*NL*
was
neither
town
nor
country
,
and
yet
was
either
spoiled
,
when
his
ears
*NL*
were
invaded
by
the
sound
of
music
.
The
clashing
and
banging
band
*NL*
attached
to
the
horse-riding
establishment
,
which
had
there
set
up
its
*NL*
rest
in
a
wooden
pavilion
,
was
in
full
bray
.
A
flag
,
floating
from
the
*NL*
summit
of
the
temple
,
proclaimed
to
mankind
that
it
was
`
Sleary
's
*NL*
Horse-riding
'
which
claimed
their
suffrages
.
Sleary
himself
,
a
stout
*NL*
modern
statue
with
a
money-box
at
its
elbow
,
in
an
ecclesiastical
niche
*NL*
of
early
Gothic
architecture
,
took
the
money
.
Miss
Josephine
Sleary
,
as
*NL*
some
very
long
and
very
narrow
strips
of
printed
bill
announced
,
was
then
*NL*
inaugurating
the
entertainments
with
her
graceful
equestrian
Tyrolean
*NL*
flower-act
.
Among
the
other
pleasing
but
always
strictly
moral
wonders
*NL*
which
must
be
seen
to
be
believed
,
Signor
Jupe
was
that
afternoon
to
*NL*
`
elucidate
the
diverting
accomplishments
of
his
highly
trained
performing
*NL*
dog
Merrylegs
.
'
He
was
also
to
exhibit
`
his
astounding
feat
of
throwing
*NL*
seventy-five
hundred-weight
in
rapid
succession
backhanded
over
his
head
,
*NL*
thus
forming
a
fountain
of
solid
iron
in
mid-air
,
a
feat
never
before
*NL*
attempted
in
this
or
any
other
country
,
and
which
having
elicited
such
*NL*
rapturous
plaudits
from
enthusiastic
throngs
it
can
not
be
withdrawn
.
'
*NL*
The
same
Signor
Jupe
was
to
`
enliven
the
varied
performances
at
frequent
*NL*
intervals
with
his
chaste
Shaksperean
quips
and
retorts
.
'
Lastly
,
he
was
*NL*
to
wind
them
up
by
appearing
in
his
favourite
character
of
Mr.
William
*NL*
Button
,
of
Tooley
Street
,
in
`
the
highly
novel
and
laughable
*NL*
hippo-comedietta
of
The
Tailor
's
Journey
to
Brentford
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thomas
Gradgrind
took
no
heed
of
these
trivialities
of
course
,
but
passed
*NL*
on
as
a
practical
man
ought
to
pass
on
,
either
brushing
the
noisy
insects
*NL*
from
his
thoughts
,
or
consigning
them
to
the
House
of
Correction
.
But
,
*NL*
the
turning
of
the
road
took
him
by
the
back
of
the
booth
,
and
at
the
*NL*
back
of
the
booth
a
number
of
children
were
congregated
in
a
number
of
*NL*
stealthy
attitudes
,
striving
to
peep
in
at
the
hidden
glories
of
the
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
brought
him
to
a
stop
.
`
Now
,
to
think
of
these
vagabonds
,
'
said
he
,
*NL*
`
attracting
the
young
rabble
from
a
model
school
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
space
of
stunted
grass
and
dry
rubbish
being
between
him
and
the
young
*NL*
rabble
,
he
took
his
eyeglass
out
of
his
waistcoat
to
look
for
any
child
*NL*
he
knew
by
name
,
and
might
order
off
.
Phenomenon
almost
incredible
*NL*
though
distinctly
seen
,
what
did
he
then
behold
but
his
own
metallurgical
*NL*
Louisa
,
peeping
with
all
her
might
through
a
hole
in
a
deal
board
,
and
*NL*
his
own
mathematical
Thomas
abasing
himself
on
the
ground
to
catch
but
a
*NL*
hoof
of
the
graceful
equestrian
Tyrolean
flower-act
!
*NL*
*NL*
Dumb
with
amazement
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
crossed
to
the
spot
where
his
family
*NL*
was
thus
disgraced
,
laid
his
hand
upon
each
erring
child
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
!!
Thomas
!!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Both
rose
,
red
and
disconcerted
.
But
,
Louisa
looked
at
her
father
with
*NL*
more
boldness
than
Thomas
did
.
Indeed
,
Thomas
did
not
look
at
him
,
but
*NL*
gave
himself
up
to
be
taken
home
like
a
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
the
name
of
wonder
,
idleness
,
and
folly
!
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
leading
*NL*
each
away
by
a
hand
;
`
what
do
you
do
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
,
'
returned
Louisa
,
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
it
was
like
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
father
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
air
of
jaded
sullenness
in
them
both
,
and
particularly
in
*NL*
the
girl
:
yet
,
struggling
through
the
dissatisfaction
of
her
face
,
there
*NL*
was
a
light
with
nothing
to
rest
upon
,
a
fire
with
nothing
to
burn
,
a
*NL*
starved
imagination
keeping
life
in
itself
somehow
,
which
brightened
its
*NL*
expression
.
Not
with
the
brightness
natural
to
cheerful
youth
,
but
with
*NL*
uncertain
,
eager
,
doubtful
flashes
,
which
had
something
painful
in
them
,
*NL*
analogous
to
the
changes
on
a
blind
face
groping
its
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
child
now
,
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
;
but
at
no
distant
day
would
*NL*
seem
to
become
a
woman
all
at
once
.
Her
father
thought
so
as
he
looked
*NL*
at
her
.
She
was
pretty
.
Would
have
been
self-willed
-LRB-
he
thought
in
his
*NL*
eminently
practical
way
-RRB-
but
for
her
bringing-up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thomas
,
though
I
have
the
fact
before
me
,
I
find
it
difficult
to
believe
*NL*
that
you
,
with
your
education
and
resources
,
should
have
brought
your
*NL*
sister
to
a
scene
like
this
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
brought
_
him
_
,
father
,
'
said
Louisa
,
quickly
.
'
I
asked
him
to
come
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
.
I
am
very
sorry
indeed
to
hear
it
.
It
makes
*NL*
Thomas
no
better
,
and
it
makes
you
worse
,
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
her
father
again
,
but
no
tear
fell
down
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
!
Thomas
and
you
,
to
whom
the
circle
of
the
sciences
is
open
;
Thomas
*NL*
and
you
,
who
may
be
said
to
be
replete
with
facts
;
Thomas
and
you
,
who
*NL*
have
been
trained
to
mathematical
exactness
;
Thomas
and
you
,
here
!
'
cried
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
In
this
degraded
position
!
I
am
amazed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
tired
,
father
.
I
have
been
tired
a
long
time
,
'
said
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tired
?
Of
what
?
'
asked
the
astonished
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
of
what
--
of
everything
,
I
think
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Say
not
another
word
,
'
returned
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
You
are
childish
.
I
*NL*
will
hear
no
more
.
'
He
did
not
speak
again
until
they
had
walked
some
*NL*
half-a-mile
in
silence
,
when
he
gravely
broke
out
with
:
`
What
would
your
*NL*
best
friends
say
,
Louisa
?
Do
you
attach
no
value
to
their
good
opinion
?
*NL*
What
would
Mr.
Bounderby
say
?
'
At
the
mention
of
this
name
,
his
daughter
*NL*
stole
a
look
at
him
,
remarkable
for
its
intense
and
searching
character
.
*NL*
He
saw
nothing
of
it
,
for
before
he
looked
at
her
,
she
had
again
cast
*NL*
down
her
eyes
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
,
'
he
repeated
presently
,
`
would
Mr.
Bounderby
say
?
'
All
the
way
to
*NL*
Stone
Lodge
,
as
with
grave
indignation
he
led
the
two
delinquents
home
,
*NL*
he
repeated
at
intervals
`
What
would
Mr.
Bounderby
say
?
'
--
as
if
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
had
been
Mrs.
Grundy
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
MR.
BOUNDERBY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
NOT
being
Mrs.
Grundy
,
who
_
was
_
Mr.
Bounderby
?
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
Mr.
Bounderby
was
as
near
being
Mr.
Gradgrind
's
bosom
friend
,
as
a
*NL*
man
perfectly
devoid
of
sentiment
can
approach
that
spiritual
*NL*
relationship
towards
another
man
perfectly
devoid
of
sentiment
.
So
near
*NL*
was
Mr.
Bounderby
--
or
,
if
the
reader
should
prefer
it
,
so
far
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
rich
man
:
banker
,
merchant
,
manufacturer
,
and
what
not
.
A
big
,
*NL*
loud
man
,
with
a
stare
,
and
a
metallic
laugh
.
A
man
made
out
of
a
coarse
*NL*
material
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
stretched
to
make
so
much
of
him
.
A
*NL*
man
with
a
great
puffed
head
and
forehead
,
swelled
veins
in
his
temples
,
*NL*
and
such
a
strained
skin
to
his
face
that
it
seemed
to
hold
his
eyes
*NL*
open
,
and
lift
his
eyebrows
up
.
A
man
with
a
pervading
appearance
on
him
*NL*
of
being
inflated
like
a
balloon
,
and
ready
to
start
.
A
man
who
could
*NL*
never
sufficiently
vaunt
himself
a
self-made
man
.
A
man
who
was
always
*NL*
proclaiming
,
through
that
brassy
speaking-trumpet
of
a
voice
of
his
,
his
*NL*
old
ignorance
and
his
old
poverty
.
A
man
who
was
the
Bully
of
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
year
or
two
younger
than
his
eminently
practical
friend
,
Mr.
Bounderby
*NL*
looked
older
;
his
seven
or
eight
and
forty
might
have
had
the
seven
or
*NL*
eight
added
to
it
again
,
without
surprising
anybody
.
He
had
not
much
*NL*
hair
.
One
might
have
fancied
he
had
talked
it
off
;
and
that
what
was
*NL*
left
,
all
standing
up
in
disorder
,
was
in
that
condition
from
being
*NL*
constantly
blown
about
by
his
windy
boastfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
formal
drawing-room
of
Stone
Lodge
,
standing
on
the
hearthrug
,
*NL*
warming
himself
before
the
fire
,
Mr.
Bounderby
delivered
some
*NL*
observations
to
Mrs.
Gradgrind
on
the
circumstance
of
its
being
his
*NL*
birthday
.
He
stood
before
the
fire
,
partly
because
it
was
a
cool
spring
*NL*
afternoon
,
though
the
sun
shone
;
partly
because
the
shade
of
Stone
Lodge
*NL*
was
always
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
damp
mortar
;
partly
because
he
thus
*NL*
took
up
a
commanding
position
,
from
which
to
subdue
Mrs.
Gradgrind
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
had
n't
a
shoe
to
my
foot
.
As
to
a
stocking
,
I
did
n't
know
such
a
*NL*
thing
by
name
.
I
passed
the
day
in
a
ditch
,
and
the
night
in
a
pigsty
.
*NL*
That
's
the
way
I
spent
my
tenth
birthday
.
Not
that
a
ditch
was
new
to
*NL*
me
,
for
I
was
born
in
a
ditch
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
a
little
,
thin
,
white
,
pink-eyed
bundle
of
shawls
,
of
*NL*
surpassing
feebleness
,
mental
and
bodily
;
who
was
always
taking
physic
*NL*
without
any
effect
,
and
who
,
whenever
she
showed
a
symptom
of
coming
to
*NL*
life
,
was
invariably
stunned
by
some
weighty
piece
of
fact
tumbling
on
*NL*
her
;
Mrs.
Gradgrind
hoped
it
was
a
dry
ditch
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
As
wet
as
a
sop
.
A
foot
of
water
in
it
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Enough
to
give
a
baby
cold
,
'
Mrs.
Gradgrind
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cold
?
I
was
born
with
inflammation
of
the
lungs
,
and
of
everything
*NL*
else
,
I
believe
,
that
was
capable
of
inflammation
,
'
returned
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
.
`
For
years
,
ma'am
,
I
was
one
of
the
most
miserable
little
*NL*
wretches
ever
seen
.
I
was
so
sickly
,
that
I
was
always
moaning
and
*NL*
groaning
.
I
was
so
ragged
and
dirty
,
that
you
would
n't
have
touched
me
*NL*
with
a
pair
of
tongs
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gradgrind
faintly
looked
at
the
tongs
,
as
the
most
appropriate
thing
*NL*
her
imbecility
could
think
of
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
I
fought
through
it
,
_
I
_
do
n't
know
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
'
I
was
*NL*
determined
,
I
suppose
.
I
have
been
a
determined
character
in
later
life
,
*NL*
and
I
suppose
I
was
then
.
Here
I
am
,
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
anyhow
,
and
nobody
*NL*
to
thank
for
my
being
here
,
but
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gradgrind
meekly
and
weakly
hoped
that
his
mother
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
My
_
mother
?
Bolted
,
ma'am
!
'
said
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
stunned
as
usual
,
collapsed
and
gave
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
mother
left
me
to
my
grandmother
,
'
said
Bounderby
;
`
and
,
according
to
*NL*
the
best
of
my
remembrance
,
my
grandmother
was
the
wickedest
and
the
*NL*
worst
old
woman
that
ever
lived
.
If
I
got
a
little
pair
of
shoes
by
any
*NL*
chance
,
she
would
take
'em
off
and
sell
'em
for
drink
.
Why
,
I
have
known
*NL*
that
grandmother
of
mine
lie
in
her
bed
and
drink
her
four-teen
glasses
*NL*
of
liquor
before
breakfast
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
weakly
smiling
,
and
giving
no
other
sign
of
vitality
,
*NL*
looked
-LRB-
as
she
always
did
-RRB-
like
an
indifferently
executed
transparency
of
*NL*
a
small
female
figure
,
without
enough
light
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
kept
a
chandler
's
shop
,
'
pursued
Bounderby
,
`
and
kept
me
in
an
*NL*
egg-box
.
That
was
the
cot
of
_
my
_
infancy
;
an
old
egg-box
.
As
soon
as
I
*NL*
was
big
enough
to
run
away
,
of
course
I
ran
away
.
Then
I
became
a
young
*NL*
vagabond
;
and
instead
of
one
old
woman
knocking
me
about
and
starving
me
,
*NL*
everybody
of
all
ages
knocked
me
about
and
starved
me
.
They
were
right
;
*NL*
they
had
no
business
to
do
anything
else
.
I
was
a
nuisance
,
an
*NL*
incumbrance
,
and
a
pest
.
I
know
that
very
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
His
pride
in
having
at
any
time
of
his
life
achieved
such
a
great
social
*NL*
distinction
as
to
be
a
nuisance
,
an
incumbrance
,
and
a
pest
,
was
only
to
*NL*
be
satisfied
by
three
sonorous
repetitions
of
the
boast
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
to
pull
through
it
,
I
suppose
,
Mrs.
Gradgrind
.
Whether
I
was
to
*NL*
do
it
or
not
,
ma'am
,
I
did
it
.
I
pulled
through
it
,
though
nobody
threw
*NL*
me
out
a
rope
.
Vagabond

vagabond
,
labourer
,
porter
,
clerk
,
*NL*
chief
manager
,
small
partner
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
.
Those
are
*NL*
the
antecedents
,
and
the
culmination
.
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
*NL*
learnt
his
letters
from
the
outsides
of
the
shops
,
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
and
*NL*
was
first
able
to
tell
the
time
upon
a
dial-plate
,
from
studying
the
*NL*
steeple
clock
of
St.
Giles
's
Church
,
London
,
under
the
direction
of
a
*NL*
drunken
cripple
,
who
was
a
convicted
thief
,
and
an
incorrigible
vagrant
.
*NL*
Tell
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
of
your
district
schools
and
your
*NL*
model
schools
,
and
your
training
schools
,
and
your
whole
kettle-of-fish
*NL*
of
schools
;
and
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
tells
you
plainly
,
all
*NL*
right
,
all
correct
--
he
had
n't
such
advantages
--
but
let
us
have
hard-headed
,
*NL*
solid-fisted
people
--
the
education
that
made
him
wo
n't
do
for
everybody
,
*NL*
he
knows
well
--
such
and
such
his
education
was
,
however
,
and
you
may
force
*NL*
him
to
swallow
boiling
fat
,
but
you
shall
never
force
him
to
suppress
the
*NL*
facts
of
his
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Being
heated
when
he
arrived
at
this
climax
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
*NL*
stopped
.
He
stopped
just
as
his
eminently
practical
friend
,
still
*NL*
accompanied
by
the
two
young
culprits
,
entered
the
room
.
His
eminently
*NL*
practical
friend
,
on
seeing
him
,
stopped
also
,
and
gave
Louisa
a
*NL*
reproachful
look
that
plainly
said
,
`
Behold
your
Bounderby
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
blustered
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
what
's
the
matter
?
What
is
young
*NL*
Thomas
in
the
dumps
about
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
of
young
Thomas
,
but
he
looked
at
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
were
peeping
at
the
circus
,
'
muttered
Louisa
,
haughtily
,
without
*NL*
lifting
up
her
eyes
,
`
and
father
caught
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
,
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
'
said
her
husband
in
a
lofty
manner
,
'
I
should
as
*NL*
soon
have
expected
to
find
my
children
reading
poetry
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
me
,
'
whimpered
Mrs.
Gradgrind
.
`
How
can
you
,
Louisa
and
Thomas
!
I
*NL*
wonder
at
you
.
I
declare
you
're
enough
to
make
one
regret
ever
having
*NL*
had
a
family
at
all
.
I
have
a
great
mind
to
say
I
wish
I
had
n't
.
_
Then
_
*NL*
what
would
you
have
done
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
did
not
seem
favourably
impressed
by
these
cogent
remarks
.
*NL*
He
frowned
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
if
,
with
my
head
in
its
present
throbbing
state
,
you
could
n't
go
and
*NL*
look
at
the
shells
and
minerals
and
things
provided
for
you
,
instead
of
*NL*
circuses
!
'
said
Mrs.
Gradgrind
.
`
You
know
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
no
young
*NL*
people
have
circus
masters
,
or
keep
circuses
in
cabinets
,
or
attend
*NL*
lectures
about
circuses
.
What
can
you
possibly
want
to
know
of
circuses
*NL*
then
?
I
am
sure
you
have
enough
to
do
,
if
that
's
what
you
want
.
With
my
*NL*
head
in
its
present
state
,
I
could
n't
remember
the
mere
names
of
half
the
*NL*
facts
you
have
got
to
attend
to
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
the
reason
!
'
pouted
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
tell
me
that
's
the
reason
,
because
it
ca
n't
be
nothing
of
the
*NL*
sort
,
'
said
Mrs.
Gradgrind
.
`
Go
and
be
somethingological
directly
.
'
*NL*
Mrs.
Gradgrind
was
not
a
scientific
character
,
and
usually
dismissed
her
*NL*
children
to
their
studies
with
this
general
injunction
to
choose
their
*NL*
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
,
Mrs.
Gradgrind
's
stock
of
facts
in
general
was
woefully
*NL*
defective
;
but
Mr.
Gradgrind
in
raising
her
to
her
high
matrimonial
*NL*
position
,
had
been
influenced
by
two
reasons
.
Firstly
,
she
was
most
*NL*
satisfactory
as
a
question
of
figures
;
and
,
secondly
,
she
had
`
no
*NL*
nonsense
'
about
her
.
By
nonsense
he
meant
fancy
;
and
truly
it
is
*NL*
probable
she
was
as
free
from
any
alloy
of
that
nature
,
as
any
human
*NL*
being
not
arrived
at
the
perfection
of
an
absolute
idiot
,
ever
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
simple
circumstance
of
being
left
alone
with
her
husband
and
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
was
sufficient
to
stun
this
admirable
lady
again
without
*NL*
collision
between
herself
and
any
other
fact
.
So
,
she
once
more
died
*NL*
away
,
and
nobody
minded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bounderby
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
drawing
a
chair
to
the
fireside
,
`
you
*NL*
are
always
so
interested
in
my
young
people
--
particularly
in
Louisa
--
that
I
*NL*
make
no
apology
for
saying
to
you
,
I
am
very
much
vexed
by
this
*NL*
discovery
.
I
have
systematically
devoted
myself
-LRB-
as
you
know
-RRB-
to
the
*NL*
education
of
the
reason
of
my
family
.
The
reason
is
-LRB-
as
you
know
-RRB-
the
*NL*
only
faculty
to
which
education
should
be
addressed
.
`
And
yet
,
*NL*
Bounderby
,
it
would
appear
from
this
unexpected
circumstance
of
to-day
,
*NL*
though
in
itself
a
trifling
one
,
as
if
something
had
crept
into
Thomas
's
*NL*
and
Louisa
's
minds
which
is
--
or
rather
,
which
is
not
--
I
do
n't
know
that
I
*NL*
can
express
myself
better
than
by
saying
--
which
has
never
been
intended
to
*NL*
be
developed
,
and
in
which
their
reason
has
no
part
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
certainly
is
no
reason
in
looking
with
interest
at
a
parcel
of
*NL*
vagabonds
,
'
returned
Bounderby
.
`
When
I
was
a
vagabond
myself
,
nobody
*NL*
looked
with
any
interest
at
_
me
_
;
I
know
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
comes
the
question
;
said
the
eminently
practical
father
,
with
his
*NL*
eyes
on
the
fire
,
`
in
what
has
this
vulgar
curiosity
its
rise
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
you
in
what
.
In
idle
imagination
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
not
,
'
said
the
eminently
practical
;
'
I
confess
,
however
,
that
the
*NL*
misgiving
_
has
_
crossed
me
on
my
way
home
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
idle
imagination
,
Gradgrind
,
'
repeated
Bounderby
.
'
A
very
bad
thing
*NL*
for
anybody
,
but
a
cursed
bad
thing
for
a
girl
like
Louisa
.
I
should
ask
*NL*
Mrs.
Gradgrind
's
pardon
for
strong
expressions
,
but
that
she
knows
very
*NL*
well
I
am
not
a
refined
character
.
Whoever
expects
refinement
in
_
me
_
*NL*
will
be
disappointed
.
I
had
n't
a
refined
bringing
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whether
,
'
said
Gradgrind
,
pondering
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
*NL*
his
cavernous
eyes
on
the
fire
,
`
whether
any
instructor
or
servant
can
*NL*
have
suggested
anything
?
Whether
Louisa
or
Thomas
can
have
been
reading
*NL*
anything
?
Whether
,
in
spite
of
all
precautions
,
any
idle
story-book
can
*NL*
have
got
into
the
house
?
Because
,
in
minds
that
have
been
practically
*NL*
formed
by
rule
and
line
,
from
the
cradle
upwards
,
this
is
so
curious
,
so
*NL*
incomprehensible
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
a
bit
!
'
cried
Bounderby
,
who
all
this
time
had
been
standing
,
as
*NL*
before
,
on
the
hearth
,
bursting
at
the
very
furniture
of
the
room
with
*NL*
explosive
humility
.
`
You
have
one
of
those
strollers
'
children
in
the
*NL*
school
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cecilia
Jupe
,
by
name
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
with
something
of
a
stricken
*NL*
look
at
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
stop
a
bit
!
'
cried
Bounderby
again
.
`
How
did
she
come
there
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
I
saw
the
girl
myself
,
for
the
first
time
,
only
just
*NL*
now
.
She
specially
applied
here
at
the
house
to
be
admitted
,
as
not
*NL*
regularly
belonging
to
our
town
,
and
--
yes
,
you
are
right
,
Bounderby
,
you
*NL*
are
right
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
stop
a
bit
!
'
cried
Bounderby
,
once
more
.
`
Louisa
saw
her
when
she
*NL*
came
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
certainly
did
see
her
,
for
she
mentioned
the
application
to
me
.
*NL*
But
Louisa
saw
her
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
in
Mrs.
Gradgrind
's
presence
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pray
,
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
what
passed
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
my
poor
health
!
'
returned
Mrs.
Gradgrind
.
`
The
girl
wanted
to
come
*NL*
to
the
school
,
and
Mr.
Gradgrind
wanted
girls
to
come
to
the
school
,
and
*NL*
Louisa
and
Thomas
both
said
that
the
girl
wanted
to
come
,
and
that
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
wanted
girls
to
come
,
and
how
was
it
possible
to
contradict
*NL*
them
when
such
was
the
fact
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
I
tell
you
what
,
Gradgrind
!
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
Turn
this
girl
to
*NL*
the
right
about
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
much
of
your
opinion
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
it
at
once
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
has
always
been
my
motto
from
a
child
.
*NL*
When
I
thought
I
would
run
away
from
my
egg-box
and
my
grandmother
,
I
did
*NL*
it
at
once
.
Do
you
the
same
.
Do
this
at
once
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
walking
?
'
asked
his
friend
.
'
I
have
the
father
's
address
.
*NL*
Perhaps
you
would
not
mind
walking
to
town
with
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
the
least
in
the
world
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
as
long
as
you
do
it
*NL*
at
once
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
Mr.
Bounderby
threw
on
his
hat
--
he
always
threw
it
on
,
as
expressing
a
*NL*
man
who
had
been
far
too
busily
employed
in
making
himself
,
to
acquire
*NL*
any
fashion
of
wearing
his
hat
--
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
*NL*
sauntered
out
into
the
hall
.
'
I
never
wear
gloves
,
'
it
was
his
custom
to
*NL*
say
.
'
I
did
n't
climb
up
the
ladder
in
_
them
_
.
--
Should
n't
be
so
high
up
,
*NL*
if
I
had
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Being
left
to
saunter
in
the
hall
a
minute
or
two
while
Mr.
Gradgrind
*NL*
went
up-stairs
for
the
address
,
he
opened
the
door
of
the
children
's
*NL*
study
and
looked
into
that
serene
floor-clothed
apartment
,
which
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
its
book-cases
and
its
cabinets
and
its
variety
of
*NL*
learned
and
philosophical
appliances
,
had
much
of
the
genial
aspect
of
a
*NL*
room
devoted
to
hair-cutting
.
Louisa
languidly
leaned
upon
the
window
*NL*
looking
out
,
without
looking
at
anything
,
while
young
Thomas
stood
*NL*
sniffing
revengefully
at
the
fire
.
Adam
Smith
and
Malthus
,
two
younger
*NL*
Gradgrinds
,
were
out
at
lecture
in
custody
;
and
little
Jane
,
after
*NL*
manufacturing
a
good
deal
of
moist
pipe-clay
on
her
face
with
*NL*
slate-pencil
and
tears
,
had
fallen
asleep
over
vulgar
fractions
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
all
right
now
,
Louisa
:
it
's
all
right
,
young
Thomas
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
;
`
you
wo
n't
do
so
any
more
.
I
'll
answer
for
it
's
being
all
*NL*
over
with
father
.
Well
,
Louisa
,
that
's
worth
a
kiss
,
is
n't
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
can
take
one
,
Mr.
Bounderby
,
'
returned
Louisa
,
when
she
had
coldly
*NL*
paused
,
and
slowly
walked
across
the
room
,
and
ungraciously
raised
her
*NL*
cheek
towards
him
,
with
her
face
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Always
my
pet
;
ai
n't
you
,
Louisa
?
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
Good-bye
,
*NL*
Louisa
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
his
way
,
but
she
stood
on
the
same
spot
,
rubbing
the
cheek
he
had
*NL*
kissed
,
with
her
handkerchief
,
until
it
was
burning
red
.
She
was
still
*NL*
doing
this
,
five
minutes
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
are
you
about

Loo
?
'
her
brother
sulkily
remonstrated
.
`
You
'll
rub
*NL*
a
hole
in
your
face

*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
cut

piece
out

penknife

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
THE
KEYNOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
COKETOWN
,
to
which
Messrs.
Bounderby
and
Gradgrind
now
walked
,
was
a
*NL*
triumph
of
fact
;
it
had
no
greater
taint
of
fancy
in
it
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Gradgrind
herself
.
Let
us
strike
the
key-note
,
Coketown
,
before
pursuing
*NL*
our
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
town
of
red
brick
,
or
of
brick
that
would
have
been
red
if
the
*NL*
smoke
and
ashes
had
allowed
it
;
but
as
matters
stood
,
it
was
a
town
of
*NL*
unnatural
red
and
black
like
the
painted
face
of
a
savage
.
It
was
a
town
*NL*
of
machinery
and
tall
chimneys
,
out
of
which
interminable
serpents
of
*NL*
smoke
trailed
themselves
for
ever
and
ever
,
and
never
got
uncoiled
.
It
*NL*
had
a
black
canal
in
it
,
and
a
river
that
ran
purple
with
ill-smelling
*NL*
dye
,
and
vast
piles
of
building
full
of
windows
where
there
was
a
*NL*
rattling
and
a
trembling
all
day
long
,
and
where
the
piston
of
the
*NL*
steam-engine
worked
monotonously
up
and
down
,
like
the
head
of
an
*NL*
elephant
in
a
state
of
melancholy
madness
.
It
contained
several
large
*NL*
streets
all
very
like
one
another
,
and
many
small
streets
still
more
like
*NL*
one
another
,
inhabited
by
people
equally
like
one
another
,
who
all
went
*NL*
in
and
out
at
the
same
hours
,
with
the
same
sound
upon
the
same
*NL*
pavements
,
to
do
the
same
work
,
and
to
whom
every
day
was
the
same
as
*NL*
yesterday
and
to-morrow
,
and
every
year
the
counterpart
of
the
last
and
*NL*
the
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
attributes
of
Coketown
were
in
the
main
inseparable
from
the
work
*NL*
by
which
it
was
sustained
;
against
them
were
to
be
set
off
,
comforts
of
*NL*
life
which
found
their
way
all
over
the
world
,
and
elegancies
of
life
*NL*
which
made
,
we
will
not
ask
how
much
of
the
fine
lady
,
who
could
scarcely
*NL*
bear
to
hear
the
place
mentioned
.
The
rest
of
its
features
were
*NL*
voluntary
,
and
they
were
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
saw
nothing
in
Coketown
but
what
was
severely
workful
.
If
the
*NL*
members
of
a
religious
persuasion
built
a
chapel
there
--
as
the
members
of
*NL*
eighteen
religious
persuasions
had
done
--
they
made
it
a
pious
warehouse
of
*NL*
red
brick
,
with
sometimes
-LRB-
but
this
is
only
in
highly
ornamental
*NL*
examples
-RRB-
a
bell
in
a
birdcage
on
the
top
of
it
.
The
solitary
exception
*NL*
was
the
New
Church
;
a
stuccoed
edifice
with
a
square
steeple
over
the
*NL*
door
,
terminating
in
four
short
pinnacles
like
florid
wooden
legs
.
All
*NL*
the
public
inscriptions
in
the
town
were
painted
alike
,
in
severe
*NL*
characters
of
black
and
white
.
The
jail
might
have
been
the
infirmary
,
*NL*
the
infirmary
might
have
been
the
jail
,
the
town-hall
might
have
been
*NL*
either
,
or
both
,
or
anything
else
,
for
anything
that
appeared
to
the
*NL*
contrary
in
the
graces
of
their
construction
.
Fact
,
fact
,
fact
,
*NL*
everywhere
in
the
material
aspect
of
the
town
;
fact
,
fact
,
fact
,
*NL*
everywhere
in
the
immaterial
.
The
M'Choakumchild
school
was
all
fact
,
*NL*
and
the
school
of
design
was
all
fact
,
and
the
relations
between
master
*NL*
and
man
were
all
fact
,
and
everything
was
fact
between
the
lying-in
*NL*
hospital
and
the
cemetery
,
and
what
you
could
n't
state
in
figures
,
or
*NL*
show
to
be
purchaseable
in
the
cheapest
market
and
saleable
in
the
*NL*
dearest
,
was
not
,
and
never
should
be
,
world
without
end
,
Amen
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
town
so
sacred
to
fact
,
and
so
triumphant
in
its
assertion
,
of
course
*NL*
got
on
well
?
Why
no
,
not
quite
well
.
No
?
Dear
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
Coketown
did
not
come
out
of
its
own
furnaces
,
in
all
respects
like
*NL*
gold
that
had
stood
the
fire
.
First
,
the
perplexing
mystery
of
the
place
*NL*
was
,
Who
belonged
to
the
eighteen
denominations
?
Because
,
whoever
did
,
*NL*
the
labouring
people
did
not
.
It
was
very
strange
to
walk
through
the
*NL*
streets
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
and
note
how
few
of
_
them
_
the
barbarous
*NL*
jangling
of
bells
that
was
driving
the
sick
and
nervous
mad
,
called
away
*NL*
from
their
own
quarter
,
from
their
own
close
rooms
,
from
the
corners
of
*NL*
their
own
streets
,
where
they
lounged
listlessly
,
gazing
at
all
the
*NL*
church
and
chapel
going
,
as
at
a
thing
with
which
they
had
no
manner
of
*NL*
concern
.
Nor
was
it
merely
the
stranger
who
noticed
this
,
because
there
*NL*
was
a
native
organization
in
Coketown
itself
,
whose
members
were
to
be
*NL*
heard
of
in
the
House
of
Commons
every
session
,
indignantly
petitioning
*NL*
for
acts
of
parliament
that
should
make
these
people
religious
by
main
*NL*
force
.
Then
came
the
Teetotal
Society
,
who
complained
that
these
same
*NL*
people
_
would
_
get
drunk
,
and
showed
in
tabular
statements
that
they
did
*NL*
get
drunk
,
and
proved
at
tea
parties
that
no
inducement
,
human
or
Divine
*NL*
-LRB-
except
a
medal
-RRB-
,
would
induce
them
to
forego
their
custom
of
getting
*NL*
drunk
.
Then
came
the
chemist
and
druggist
,
with
other
tabular
*NL*
statements
,
showing
that
when
they
did
n't
get
drunk
,
they
took
opium
.
*NL*
Then
came
the
experienced
chaplain
of
the
jail
,
with
more
tabular
*NL*
statements
,
outdoing
all
the
previous
tabular
statements
,
and
showing
*NL*
that
the
same
people
_
would
_
resort
to
low
haunts
,
hidden
from
the
public
*NL*
eye
,
where
they
heard
low
singing
and
saw
low
dancing
,
and
mayhap
joined
*NL*
in
it
;
and
where
A.
B.
,
aged
twenty-four
next
birthday
,
and
committed
for
*NL*
eighteen
months
'
solitary
,
had
himself
said
-LRB-
not
that
he
had
ever
shown
*NL*
himself
particularly
worthy
of
belief
-RRB-
his
ruin
began
,
as
he
was
*NL*
perfectly
sure
and
confident
that
otherwise
he
would
have
been
a
tip-top
*NL*
moral
specimen
.
Then
came
Mr.
Gradgrind
and
Mr.
Bounderby
,
the
two
*NL*
gentlemen
at
this
present
moment
walking
through
Coketown
,
and
both
*NL*
eminently
practical
,
who
could
,
on
occasion
,
furnish
more
tabular
*NL*
statements
derived
from
their
own
personal
experience
,
and
illustrated
by
*NL*
cases
they
had
known
and
seen
,
from
which
it
clearly
appeared
--
in
short
,
*NL*
it
was
the
only
clear
thing
in
the
case
--
that
these
same
people
were
a
bad
*NL*
lot
altogether
,
gentlemen
;
that
do
what
you
would
for
them
they
were
*NL*
never
thankful
for
it
,
gentlemen
;
that
they
were
restless
,
gentlemen
;
*NL*
that
they
never
knew
what
they
wanted
;
that
they
lived
upon
the
best
,
and
*NL*
bought
fresh
butter
;
and
insisted
on
Mocha
coffee
,
and
rejected
all
but
*NL*
prime
parts
of
meat
,
and
yet
were
eternally
dissatisfied
and
*NL*
unmanageable
.
In
short
,
it
was
the
moral
of
the
old
nursery
fable
:
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
old
woman
,
and
what
do
you
think
?
*NL*
She
lived
upon
nothing
but
victuals
and
drink
;
*NL*
Victuals
and
drink
were
the
whole
of
her
diet
,
*NL*
And
yet
this
old
woman
would
NEVER
be
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
it
possible
,
I
wonder
,
that
there
was
any
analogy
between
the
case
of
*NL*
the
Coketown
population
and
the
case
of
the
little
Gradgrinds
?
Surely
,
*NL*
none
of
us
in
our
sober
senses
and
acquainted
with
figures
,
are
to
be
*NL*
told
at
this
time
of
day
,
that
one
of
the
foremost
elements
in
the
*NL*
existence
of
the
Coketown
working-people
had
been
for
scores
of
years
,
*NL*
deliberately
set
at
nought
?
That
there
was
any
Fancy
in
them
demanding
*NL*
to
be
brought
into
healthy
existence
instead
of
struggling
on
in
*NL*
convulsions
?
That
exactly
in
the
ratio
as
they
worked
long
and
*NL*
monotonously
,
the
craving
grew
within
them
for
some
physical
relief
--
some
*NL*
relaxation
,
encouraging
good
humour
and
good
spirits
,
and
giving
them
a
*NL*
vent
--
some
recognized
holiday
,
though
it
were
but
for
an
honest
dance
to
a
*NL*
stirring
band
of
music
--
some
occasional
light
pie
in
which
even
*NL*
M'Choakumchild
had
no
finger
--
which
craving
must
and
would
be
satisfied
*NL*
aright
,
or
must
and
would
inevitably
go
wrong
,
until
the
laws
of
the
*NL*
Creation
were
repealed
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
man
lives
at
Pod
's
End
,
and
I
do
n't
quite
know
Pod
's
End
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
.
`
Which
is
it
,
Bounderby
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
knew
it
was
somewhere
down
town
,
but
knew
no
more
*NL*
respecting
it
.
So
they
stopped
for
a
moment
,
looking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
as
they
did
so
,
there
came
running
round
the
corner
of
the
street
*NL*
at
a
quick
pace
and
with
a
frightened
look
,
a
girl
whom
Mr.
Gradgrind
*NL*
recognized
.
`
Halloa
!
'
said
he
.
`
Stop
!
Where
are
you
going
!
Stop
!
'
*NL*
Girl
number
twenty
stopped
then
,
palpitating
,
and
made
him
a
curtsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
are
you
tearing
about
the
streets
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
in
this
*NL*
improper
manner
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
--
I
was
run
after
,
sir
,
'
the
girl
panted
,
`
and
I
wanted
to
get
*NL*
away
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Run
after
?
'
repeated
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
Who
would
run
after
_
you
_
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
was
unexpectedly
and
suddenly
answered
for
her
,
by
the
*NL*
colourless
boy
,
Bitzer
,
who
came
round
the
corner
with
such
blind
speed
*NL*
and
so
little
anticipating
a
stoppage
on
the
pavement
,
that
he
brought
*NL*
himself
up
against
Mr.
Gradgrind
's
waistcoat
and
rebounded
into
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
,
boy
?
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
What
are
you
doing
?
How
*NL*
dare
you
dash
against
--
everybody
--
in
this
manner
?
'
Bitzer
picked
up
his
*NL*
cap
,
which
the
concussion
had
knocked
off
;
and
backing
,
and
knuckling
his
*NL*
forehead
,
pleaded
that
it
was
an
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Was
this
boy
running
after
you
,
Jupe
?
'
asked
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
said
the
girl
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
was
n't
,
sir
!
'
cried
Bitzer
.
`
Not
till
she
run
away
from
me
.
But
*NL*
the
horse-riders
never
mind
what
they
say
,
sir
;
they
're
famous
for
it
.
*NL*
You
know
the
horse-riders
are
famous
for
never
minding
what
they
say
,
'
*NL*
addressing
Sissy
.
`
It
's
as
well
known
in
the
town
as
--
please
,
sir
,
as
the
*NL*
multiplication
table
is
n't
known
to
the
horse-riders
.
'
Bitzer
tried
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
with
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
frightened
me
so
,
'
said
the
girl
,
`
with
his
cruel
faces
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
cried
Bitzer
.
`
Oh
!
A
n't
you
one
of
the
rest
!
A
n't
you
a
*NL*
horse-rider
!
I
never
looked
at
her
,
sir
.
I
asked
her
if
she
would
know
*NL*
how
to
define
a
horse
to-morrow
,
and
offered
to
tell
her
again
,
and
she
*NL*
ran
away
,
and
I
ran
after
her
,
sir
,
that
she
might
know
how
to
answer
*NL*
when
she
was
asked
.
You
would
n't
have
thought
of
saying
such
mischief
if
*NL*
you
had
n't
been
a
horse-rider
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Her
calling
seems
to
be
pretty
well
known
among
'em
,
'
observed
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
.
`
You
'd
have
had
the
whole
school
peeping
in
a
row
,
in
a
*NL*
week
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Truly
,
I
think
so
,
'
returned
his
friend
.
`
Bitzer
,
turn
you
about
and
*NL*
take
yourself
home
.
Jupe
,
stay
here
a
moment
.
Let
me
hear
of
your
*NL*
running
in
this
manner
any
more
,
boy
,
and
you
will
hear
of
me
through
the
*NL*
master
of
the
school
.
You
understand
what
I
mean
.
Go
along
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
stopped
in
his
rapid
blinking
,
knuckled
his
forehead
again
,
*NL*
glanced
at
Sissy
,
turned
about
,
and
retreated
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
girl
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
take
this
gentleman
and
me
to
your
*NL*
father
's
;
we
are
going
there
.
What
have
you
got
in
that
bottle
you
are
*NL*
carrying

*NL*
*NL*
`
Gin

'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
,
no
,
sir
!
It
's
the
nine
oils
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
what
?
'
cried
Mr.
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
nine
oils
,
sir
,
to
rub
father
with
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
with
a
loud
short
laugh
,
`
what
the
devil
do
*NL*
you
rub
your
father
with
nine
oils
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
what
our
people
aways
use
,
sir
,
when
they
get
any
hurts
in
the
*NL*
ring
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
looking
over
her
shoulder
,
to
assure
herself
*NL*
that
her
pursuer
was
gone
.
`
They
bruise
themselves
very
bad
sometimes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Serve
'em
right
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
for
being
idle
.
'
She
glanced
up
*NL*
at
his
face
,
with
mingled
astonishment
and
dread
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
George
!
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
when
I
was
four
or
five
years
younger
*NL*
than
you
,
I
had
worse
bruises
upon
me
than
ten
oils
,
twenty
oils
,
forty
*NL*
oils
,
would
have
rubbed
off
.
I
did
n't
get
'em
by
posture-making
,
but
by
*NL*
being
banged
about
.
There
was
no
rope-dancing
for
me
;
I
danced
on
the
*NL*
bare
ground
and
was
larruped
with
the
rope
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
though
hard
enough
,
was
by
no
means
so
rough
a
man
as
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
.
His
character
was
not
unkind
,
all
things
considered
;
it
might
*NL*
have
been
a
very
kind
one
indeed
,
if
he
had
only
made
some
round
mistake
*NL*
in
the
arithmetic
that
balanced
it
,
years
ago
.
He
said
,
in
what
he
meant
*NL*
for
a
reassuring
tone
,
as
they
turned
down
a
narrow
road
,
`
And
this
is
*NL*
Pod
's
End
;
is
it
,
Jupe
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
it
,
sir
,
and
--
if
you
would
n't
mind
,
sir
--
this
is
the
house
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
,
at
twilight
,
at
the
door
of
a
mean
little
public-house
,
with
*NL*
dim
red
lights
in
it
.
As
haggard
and
as
shabby
,
as
if
,
for
want
of
*NL*
custom
,
it
had
itself
taken
to
drinking
,
and
had
gone
the
way
all
*NL*
drunkards
go
,
and
was
very
near
the
end
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
only
crossing
the
bar
,
sir
,
and
up
the
stairs
,
if
you
would
n't
*NL*
mind
,
and
waiting
there
for
a
moment
till
I
get
a
candle
.
If
you
should
*NL*
hear
a
dog
,
sir

it
's
only
Merrylegs

he
only
barks

*NL*
*NL*
`
Merrylegs
and
nine
oils

'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
entering
last
with
his

metallic
laugh

`
Pretty
well
this

CHAPTER

SLEARY
'S
HORSEMANSHIP
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
name
of
the
public-house
was
the
Pegasus
's
Arms
.
The
Pegasus
's
legs
*NL*
might
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
;
but
,
underneath
the
winged
horse
*NL*
upon
the
sign-board
,
the
Pegasus
's
Arms
was
inscribed
in
Roman
letters
.
*NL*
Beneath
that
inscription
again
,
in
a
flowing
scroll
,
the
painter
had
*NL*
touched
off
the
lines
:
*NL*
*NL*
Good
malt
makes
good
beer
,
*NL*
Walk
in
,
and
they
'll
draw
it
here
;
*NL*
Good
wine
makes
good
brandy
,
*NL*
Give
us
a
call
,
and
you
'll
find
it
handy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Framed
and
glazed
upon
the
wall
behind
the
dingy
little
bar
,
was
another
*NL*
Pegasus
--
a
theatrical
one
--
with
real
gauze
let
in
for
his
wings
,
golden
*NL*
stars
stuck
on
all
over
him
,
and
his
ethereal
harness
made
of
red
silk
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
had
grown
too
dusky
without
,
to
see
the
sign
,
and
as
it
had
not
*NL*
grown
light
enough
within
to
see
the
picture
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
and
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
received
no
offence
from
these
idealities
.
They
followed
the
*NL*
girl
up
some
steep
corner-stairs
without
meeting
any
one
,
and
stopped
in
*NL*
the
dark
while
she
went
on
for
a
candle
.
They
expected
every
moment
to
*NL*
hear
Merrylegs
give
tongue
,
but
the
highly
trained
performing
dog
had
not
*NL*
barked
when
the
girl
and
the
candle
appeared
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
is
not
in
our
room
,
sir
,
'
she
said
,
with
a
face
of
great
*NL*
surprise
.
`
If
you
would
n't
mind
walking
in
,
I
'll
find
him
directly
.
'
*NL*
They
walked
in
;
and
Sissy
,
having
set
two
chairs
for
them
,
sped
away
with
*NL*
a
quick
light
step
.
It
was
a
mean
,
shabbily
furnished
room
,
with
a
bed
*NL*
in
it
.
The
white
night-cap
,
embellished
with
two
peacock
's
feathers
and
*NL*
a
pigtail
bolt
upright
,
in
which
Signor
Jupe
had
that
very
afternoon
*NL*
enlivened
the
varied
performances
with
his
chaste
Shaksperean
quips
and
*NL*
retorts
,
hung
upon
a
nail
;
but
no
other
portion
of
his
wardrobe
,
or
other
*NL*
token
of
himself
or
his
pursuits
,
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
.
As
to
*NL*
Merrylegs
,
that
respectable
ancestor
of
the
highly
trained
animal
who
*NL*
went
aboard
the
ark
,
might
have
been
accidentally
shut
out
of
it
,
for
any
*NL*
sign
of
a
dog
that
was
manifest
to
eye
or
ear
in
the
Pegasus
's
Arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
the
doors
of
rooms
above
,
opening
and
shutting
as
Sissy
went
*NL*
from
one
to
another
in
quest
of
her
father
;
and
presently
they
heard
*NL*
voices
expressing
surprise
.
She
came
bounding
down
again
in
a
great
*NL*
hurry
,
opened
a
battered
and
mangy
old
hair
trunk
,
found
it
empty
,
and
*NL*
looked
round
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
face
full
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
must
have
gone
down
to
the
Booth
,
sir
.
I
do
n't
know
why
he
*NL*
should
go
there
,
but
he
must
be
there
;
I
'll
bring
him
in
a
minute
!
'
She
*NL*
was
gone
directly
,
without
her
bonnet
;
with
her
long
,
dark
,
childish
hair
*NL*
streaming
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
does
she
mean
!
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
Back
in
a
minute
?
It
's
more
*NL*
than
a
mile
off
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Mr.
Bounderby
could
reply
,
a
young
man
appeared
at
the
door
,
and
*NL*
introducing
himself
with
the
words
,
`
By
your
leaves
,
gentlemen
!
'
walked
*NL*
in
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
His
face
,
close-shaven
,
thin
,
and
*NL*
sallow
,
was
shaded
by
a
great
quantity
of
dark
hair
,
brushed
into
a
roll
*NL*
all
round
his
head
,
and
parted
up
the
centre
.
His
legs
were
very
robust
,
*NL*
but
shorter
than
legs
of
good
proportions
should
have
been
.
His
chest
*NL*
and
back
were
as
much
too
broad
,
as
his
legs
were
too
short
.
He
was
*NL*
dressed
in
a
Newmarket
coat
and
tight-fitting
trousers
;
wore
a
shawl
*NL*
round
his
neck
;
smelt
of
lamp-oil
,
straw
,
orange-peel
,
horses
'
provender
,
*NL*
and
sawdust
;
and
looked
a
most
remarkable
sort
of
Centaur
,
compounded
of
*NL*
the
stable
and
the
play-house
.
Where
the
one
began
,
and
the
other
ended
,
*NL*
nobody
could
have
told
with
any
precision
.
This
gentleman
was
mentioned
*NL*
in
the
bills
of
the
day
as
Mr.
E.
W.
B.
Childers
,
so
justly
celebrated
*NL*
for
his
daring
vaulting
act
as
the
Wild
Huntsman
of
the
North
American
*NL*
Prairies
;
in
which
popular
performance
,
a
diminutive
boy
with
an
old
*NL*
face
,
who
now
accompanied
him
,
assisted
as
his
infant
son
:
being
carried
*NL*
upside
down
over
his
father
's
shoulder
,
by
one
foot
,
and
held
by
the
*NL*
crown
of
his
head
,
heels
upwards
,
in
the
palm
of
his
father
's
hand
,
*NL*
according
to
the
violent
paternal
manner
in
which
wild
huntsmen
may
be
*NL*
observed
to
fondle
their
offspring
.
Made
up
with
curls
,
wreaths
,
wings
,
*NL*
white
bismuth
,
and
carmine
,
this
hopeful
young
person
soared
into
so
*NL*
pleasing
a
Cupid
as
to
constitute
the
chief
delight
of
the
maternal
part
*NL*
of
the
spectators
;
but
in
private
,
where
his
characteristics
were
a
*NL*
precocious
cutaway
coat
and
an
extremely
gruff
voice
,
he
became
of
the
*NL*
Turf
,
turfy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
your
leaves
,
gentlemen
,
'
said
Mr.
E.
W.
B.
Childers
,
glancing
round
*NL*
the
room
.
`
It
was
you
,
I
believe
,
that
were
wishing
to
see
Jupe
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
His
daughter
has
gone
to
fetch
him
,
but
I
*NL*
ca
n't
wait
;
therefore
,
if
you
please
,
I
will
leave
a
message
for
him
with
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
see
,
my
friend
,
'
Mr.
Bounderby
put
in
,
`
we
are
the
kind
of
people
*NL*
who
know
the
value
of
time
,
and
you
are
the
kind
of
people
who
do
n't
know
*NL*
the
value
of
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
not
,
'
retorted
Mr.
Childers
,
after
surveying
him
from
head
to
*NL*
foot
,
`
the
honour
of
knowing
_
you
_
,
--
but
if
you
mean
that
you
can
make
*NL*
more
money
of
your
time
than
I
can
of
mine
,
I
should
judge
from
your
*NL*
appearance
,
that
you
are
about
right
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
when
you
have
made
it
,
you
can
keep
it
too
,
I
should
think
,
'
said
*NL*
Cupid
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Kidderminster
,
stow
that
!
'
said
Mr.
Childers
.
-LRB-
Master
Kidderminster
was
*NL*
Cupid
's
mortal
name
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
does
he
come
here
cheeking
us
for
,
then
?
'
cried
Master
*NL*
Kidderminster
,
showing
a
very
irascible
temperament
.
`
If
you
want
to
*NL*
cheek
us
,
pay
your
ochre
at
the
doors
and
take
it
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Kidderminster
,
'
said
Mr.
Childers
,
raising
his
voice
,
`
stow
that
!
--
Sir
,
'
*NL*
to
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
'
I
was
addressing
myself
to
you
.
You
may
or
you
may
*NL*
not
be
aware
-LRB-
for
perhaps
you
have
not
been
much
in
the
audience
-RRB-
,
that
*NL*
Jupe
has
missed
his
tip
very
often
,
lately
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
--
what
has
he
missed
?
'
asked
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
glancing
at
the
potent
*NL*
Bounderby
for
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Missed
his
tip
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Offered
at
the
Garters
four
times
last
night
,
and
never
done
'em
once
,
'
*NL*
said
Master
Kidderminster
.
`
Missed
his
tip
at
the
banners
,
too
,
and
was
*NL*
loose
in
his
ponging
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
n't
do
what
he
ought
to
do
.
Was
short
in
his
leaps
and
bad
in
his
*NL*
tumbling
,
'
Mr.
Childers
interpreted
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
that
is
tip
,
is
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
a
general
way
that
's
missing
his
tip
,
'
Mr.
E.
W.
B.
Childers
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nine
oils
,
Merrylegs
,
missing
tips
,
garters
,
banners
,
and
Ponging
,
eh
!
'
*NL*
ejaculated
Bounderby
,
with
his
laugh
of
laughs
.
`
Queer
sort
of
company
,
*NL*
too
,
for
a
man
who
has
raised
himself
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lower
yourself
,
then
,
'
retorted
Cupid
.
`
Oh
Lord
!
if
you
've
raised
*NL*
yourself
so
high
as
all
that
comes
to
,
let
yourself
down
a
bit
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
a
very
obtrusive
lad
!
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
turning
,
and
knitting
*NL*
his
brows
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
'd
have
had
a
young
gentleman
to
meet
you
,
if
we
had
known
you
were
*NL*
coming
,
'
retorted
Master
Kidderminster
,
nothing
abashed
.
`
It
's
a
pity
*NL*
you
do
n't
have
a
bespeak
,
being
so
particular
.
You
're
on
the
Tight-Jeff
,
*NL*
ai
n't
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
does
this
unmannerly
boy
mean
,
'
asked
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
eyeing
him
in
*NL*
a
sort
of
desperation
,
`
by
Tight-Jeff
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
!
Get
out
,
get
out
!
'
said
Mr.
Childers
,
thrusting
his
young
friend
*NL*
from
the
room
,
rather
in
the
prairie
manner
.
`
Tight-Jeff
or
Slack-Jeff
,
*NL*
it
do
n't
much
signify
:
it
's
only
tight-rope
and
slack-rope
.
You
were
*NL*
going
to
give
me
a
message
for
Jupe
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
'
continued
Mr.
Childers
,
quickly
,
`
my
opinion
is
,
he
will
never
*NL*
receive
it
.
Do
you
know
much
of
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
saw
the
man
in
my
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
doubt
if
you
ever
_
will
_
see
him
now
.
It
's
pretty
plain
to
me
,
he
's
*NL*
off
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
mean
that
he
has
deserted
his
daughter
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
!
I
mean
,
'
said
Mr.
Childers
,
with
a
nod
,
`
that
he
has
cut
.
He
was
*NL*
goosed
last
night
,
he
was
goosed
the
night
before
last
,
he
was
goosed
*NL*
to-day
.
He
has
lately
got
in
the
way
of
being
always
goosed
,
and
he
*NL*
ca
n't
stand
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
has
he
been
--
so
very
much
--
Goosed
?
'
asked
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
forcing
the
*NL*
word
out
of
himself
,
with
great
solemnity
and
reluctance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
joints
are
turning
stiff
,
and
he
is
getting
used
up
,
'
said
Childers
.
*NL*
`
He
has
his
points
as
a
Cackler
still
,
but
he
ca
n't
get
a
living
out
of
*NL*
_
them
_
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
Cackler
!
'
Bounderby
repeated
.
`
Here
we
go
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
speaker
,
if
the
gentleman
likes
it
better
,
'
said
Mr.
E.
W.
B.
*NL*
Childers
,
superciliously
throwing
the
interpretation
over
his
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
accompanying
it
with
a
shake
of
his
long
hair
--
which
all
shook
at
*NL*
once
.
`
Now
,
it
's
a
remarkable
fact
,
sir
,
that
it
cut
that
man
deeper
,
to
*NL*
know
that
his
daughter
knew
of
his
being
goosed
,
than
to
go
through
with
*NL*
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
!
'
interrupted
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
This
is
good
,
Gradgrind
!
A
man
so
*NL*
fond
of
his
daughter
,
that
he
runs
away
from
her
!
This
is
devilish
good
!
*NL*
Ha
!
ha
!
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
young
man
.
I
have
n't
always
occupied
*NL*
my
present
station
of
life
.
I
know
what
these
things
are
.
You
may
be
*NL*
astonished
to
hear
it
,
but
my
mother
--
ran
away
from
_
me
_
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
E.
W.
B.
Childers
replied
pointedly
,
that
he
was
not
at
all
astonished
to
*NL*
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
well
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
'
I
was
born
in
a
ditch
,
and
my
mother
ran
*NL*
away
from
me
.
Do
I
excuse
her
for
it
?
No
.
Have
I
ever
excused
her
for
*NL*
it
?
Not
I
.
What
do
I
call
her
for
it
?
I
call
her
probably
the
very
*NL*
worst
woman
that
ever
lived
in
the
world
,
except
my
drunken
grandmother
.
*NL*
There
's
no
family
pride
about
me
,
there
's
no
imaginative
sentimental
*NL*
humbug
about
me
.
I
call
a
spade
a
spade
;
and
I
call
the
mother
of
Josiah
*NL*
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
without
any
fear
or
any
favour
,
what
I
should
call
*NL*
her
if
she
had
been
the
mother
of
Dick
Jones
of
Wapping
.
So
,
with
this
*NL*
man
.
He
is
a
runaway
rogue
and
a
vagabond
,
that
's
what
he
is
,
in
*NL*
English
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
all
the
same
to
me
what
he
is
or
what
he
is
not
,
whether
in
English
*NL*
or
whether
in
French
,
'
retorted
Mr.
E.
W.
B.
Childers
,
facing
about
.
'
I
*NL*
am
telling
your
friend
what
's
the
fact
;
if
you
do
n't
like
to
hear
it
,
you
*NL*
can
avail
yourself
of
the
open
air
.
You
give
it
mouth
enough
,
you
do
;
*NL*
but
give
it
mouth
in
your
own
building
at
least
,

remonstrated
E.
W.
B.
*NL*
with
stern
irony
.
`
Do
n't
give
it
mouth
in
this
building
,
till
you
're
*NL*
called
upon
.
You
have
got
some
building
of
your
own
I
dare
say
,
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
so
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bounderby
,
rattling
his
money
and
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
give
it
mouth
in
your
own
building
,
will
you
,
if
you
please
?
'
said
*NL*
Childers
.
`
Because
this
is
n't
a
strong
building
,
and
too
much
of
you
*NL*
might
bring
it
down
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Eyeing
Mr.
Bounderby
from
head
to
foot
again
,
he
turned
from
him
,
as
from
*NL*
a
man
finally
disposed
of
,
to
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jupe
sent
his
daughter
out
on
an
errand
not
an
hour
ago
,
and
then
was
*NL*
seen
to
slip
out
himself
,
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
and
a
bundle
tied
*NL*
up
in
a
handkerchief
under
his
arm
.
She
will
never
believe
it
of
him
,
*NL*
but
he
has
cut
away
and
left
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pray
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
why
will
she
never
believe
it
of
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
those
two
were
one
.
Because
they
were
never
asunder
.
Because
,
*NL*
up
to
this
time
,
he
seemed
to
dote
upon
her
,
'
said
Childers
,
taking
a
*NL*
step
or
two
to
look
into
the
empty
trunk
.
Both
Mr.
Childers
and
Master
*NL*
Kidderminster
walked
in
a
curious
manner
;
with
their
legs
wider
apart
*NL*
than
the
general
run
of
men
,
and
with
a
very
knowing
assumption
of
being
*NL*
stiff
in
the
knees
.
This
walk
was
common
to
all
the
male
members
of
*NL*
Sleary
's
company
,
and
was
understood
to
express
,
that
they
were
always
on
*NL*
horseback
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
Sissy
!
He
had
better
have
apprenticed
her
,
'
said
Childers
,
giving
*NL*
his
hair
another
shake
,
as
he
looked
up
from
the
empty
box
.
`
Now
,
he
*NL*
leaves
her
without
anything
to
take
to
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
creditable
to
you
,
who
have
never
been
apprenticed
,
to
express
*NL*
that
opinion
,
'
returned
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
approvingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
never
apprenticed
?
I
was
apprenticed
when
I
was
seven
year
old
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
Indeed
?
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
rather
resentfully
,
as
having
been
*NL*
defrauded
of
his
good
opinion
.
'
I
was
not
aware
of
its
being
the
custom
*NL*
to
apprentice
young
persons
to
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Idleness
,
'
Mr.
Bounderby
put
in
with
a
loud
laugh
.
`
No
,
by
the
Lord
*NL*
Harry
!
Nor
I
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Her
father
always
had
it
in
his
head
,
'
resumed
Childers
,
feigning
*NL*
unconsciousness
of
Mr.
Bounderby
's
existence
,
`
that
she
was
to
be
taught
*NL*
the
deuce-and-all
of
education
.
How
it
got
into
his
head
,
I
ca
n't
say
;
I
*NL*
can
only
say
that
it
never
got
out
.
He
has
been
picking
up
a
bit
of
*NL*
reading
for
her
,
here
--
and
a
bit
of
writing
for
her
,
there
--
and
a
bit
of
*NL*
ciphering
for
her
,
somewhere
else
--
these
seven
years
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
E.
W.
B.
Childers
took
one
of
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
,
stroked
*NL*
his
face
and
chin
,
and
looked
,
with
a
good
deal
of
doubt
and
a
little
*NL*
hope
,
at
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
From
the
first
he
had
sought
to
conciliate
that
*NL*
gentleman
,
for
the
sake
of
the
deserted
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
Sissy
got
into
the
school
here
,
'
he
pursued
,
`
her
father
was
as
*NL*
pleased
as
Punch
.
I
could
n't
altogether
make
out
why
,
myself
,
as
we
were
*NL*
not
stationary
here
,
being
but
comers
and
goers
anywhere
.
I
suppose
,
*NL*
however
,
he
had
this
move
in
his
mind
--
he
was
always
half-cracked
--
and
then
*NL*
considered
her
provided
for
.
If
you
should
happen
to
have
looked
in
*NL*
to-night
,
for
the
purpose
of
telling
him
that
you
were
going
to
do
her
*NL*
any
little
service
,
'
said
Mr.
Childers
,
stroking
his
face
again
,
and
*NL*
repeating
his
look
,
`
it
would
be
very
fortunate
and
well-timed
;
very
*NL*
fortunate
and
well-timed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
On
the
contrary
,
'
returned
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
'
I
came
to
tell
him
that
her
*NL*
connections
made
her
not
an
object
for
the
school
,
and
that
she
must
not
*NL*
attend
any
more
.
Still
,
if
her
father
really
has
left
her
,
without
any
*NL*
connivance
on
her
part
--
Bounderby
,
let
me
have
a
word
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
,
Mr.
Childers
politely
betook
himself
,
with
his
equestrian
*NL*
walk
,
to
the
landing
outside
the
door
,
and
there
stood
stroking
his
face
,
*NL*
and
softly
whistling
.
While
thus
engaged
,
he
overheard
such
phrases
in
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
's
voice
as
`
No
.
_
I
_
say
no
.
I
advise
you
not
.
I
say
by
*NL*
no
means
.
'
While
,
from
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
he
heard
in
his
much
lower
tone
*NL*
the
words
,
`
But
even
as
an
example
to
Louisa
,
of
what
this
pursuit
which
*NL*
has
been
the
subject
of
a
vulgar
curiosity
,
leads
to
and
ends
in
.
Think
*NL*
of
it
,
Bounderby
,
in
that
point
of
view
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
various
members
of
Sleary
's
company
gradually
gathered
*NL*
together
from
the
upper
regions
,
where
they
were
quartered
,
and
,
from
*NL*
standing
about
,
talking
in
low
voices
to
one
another
and
to
Mr.
Childers
,
*NL*
gradually
insinuated
themselves
and
him
into
the
room
.
There
were
two
or
*NL*
three
handsome
young
women
among
them
,
with
their
two
or
three
husbands
,
*NL*
and
their
two
or
three
mothers
,
and
their
eight
or
nine
little
children
,
*NL*
who
did
the
fairy
business
when
required
.
The
father
of
one
of
the
*NL*
families
was
in
the
habit
of
balancing
the
father
of
another
of
the
*NL*
families
on
the
top
of
a
great
pole
;
the
father
of
a
third
family
often
*NL*
made
a
pyramid
of
both
those
fathers
,
with
Master
Kidderminster
for
the
*NL*
apex
,
and
himself
for
the
base
;
all
the
fathers
could
dance
upon
rolling
*NL*
casks
,
stand
upon
bottles
,
catch
knives
and
balls
,
twirl
hand-basins
,
*NL*
ride
upon
anything
,
jump
over
everything
,
and
stick
at
nothing
.
All
the
*NL*
mothers
could
-LRB-
and
did
-RRB-
dance
,
upon
the
slack
wire
and
the
tight-rope
,
*NL*
and
perform
rapid
acts
on
bare-backed
steeds
;
none
of
them
were
at
all
*NL*
particular
in
respect
of
showing
their
legs
;
and
one
of
them
,
alone
in
a
*NL*
Greek
chariot
,
drove
six
in
hand
into
every
town
they
came
to
.
They
all
*NL*
assumed
to
be
mighty
rakish
and
knowing
,
they
were
not
very
tidy
in
their
*NL*
private
dresses
,
they
were
not
at
all
orderly
in
their
domestic
*NL*
arrangements
,
and
the
combined
literature
of
the
whole
company
would
have
*NL*
produced
but
a
poor
letter
on
any
subject
.
Yet
there
was
a
remarkable
*NL*
gentleness
and
childishness
about
these
people
,
a
special
inaptitude
for
*NL*
any
kind
of
sharp
practice
,
and
an
untiring
readiness
to
help
and
pity
*NL*
one
another
,
deserving
often
of
as
much
respect
,
and
always
of
as
much
*NL*
generous
construction
,
as
the
every-day
virtues
of
any
class
of
people
in
*NL*
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Last
of
all
appeared
Mr.
Sleary
:
a
stout
man
as
already
mentioned
,
with
*NL*
one
fixed
eye
,
and
one
loose
eye
,
a
voice
-LRB-
if
it
can
be
called
so
-RRB-
like
*NL*
the
efforts
of
a
broken
old
pair
of
bellows
,
a
flabby
surface
,
and
a
*NL*
muddled
head
which
was
never
sober
and
never
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thquire
!
'
said
Mr.
Sleary
,
who
was
troubled
with
asthma
,
and
whose
*NL*
breath
came
far
too
thick
and
heavy
for
the
letter
s
,

taking
off

with

,
which
he
kept
inside
for

*NL*
*NL*
Here
his
daughter
Josephine
--
a
pretty
fair-haired
girl
of
eighteen
,
who
*NL*
had
been
tied
on
a
horse
at
two
years
old
,
and
had
made
a
will
at
twelve
,
*NL*
which
she
always
carried
about
with
her
,
expressive
of
her
dying
desire
*NL*
to
be
drawn
to
the
grave
by
the
two
piebald
ponies
--
cried
,
`
Father

hush

*NL*
she
has
come

'
Then
came
Sissy
Jupe
,
running
into
the
room
as
she
*NL*
had
run
out
of
it
.
And
when
she
saw
them
all
assembled
,
and
saw
their
*NL*
looks
,
and
saw
no
father
there
,
she
broke
into
a
most
deplorable
cry
,
and
*NL*
took
refuge
on
the
bosom
of
the
most
accomplished
tight-rope
lady
*NL*
-LRB-
herself
in
the
family-way
-RRB-
,
who
knelt
down
on
the
floor
to
nurse

to
weep
over

many

upward

stretched

out

*NL*
*NL*
They
cared
so
little
for
plain

these

were
in
that

advanced
state
of
degeneracy
on

that
instead
of
being
*NL*
impressed
by
the
speaker
's
strong
common
sense
,
they
took
it
in
*NL*
extraordinary
dudgeon

muttered
`

in

Mr.

being
restrained
by

mild
suggestion

Mr.

found
an

,

Well

I

*NL*
The
only
condition
-LRB-
over

above

good

I
make
is
,
that
*NL*
you
decide
now
,
at

,
whether
to
accompany

remain
here

Also
,
*NL*
that

now

it
is
understood
that
you
communicate
no
*NL*
more
with
any
of

These
observations

comprise
the

of

At

Sleary
,

I
mutht
put
in
my
word

tho
*NL*
that
both

of

If
you

you

Emma

,
in

you

*NL*

I
*NL*
do
n't
pretend
to
be
of

,
and
I
do
n't
thay
but
what
,
*NL*
when
you
mith

,
you
'd
find
me
cut
up

,

an

But
what
I
thay

,
ith
,
that
good

or
bad
*NL*
tempered
,
I
never
did
a

no

than

that
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
part
of
this
speech
was
addressed
to
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
who
*NL*
received
it
with
a
grave
inclination
of
his
head
,
and
then
remarked
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
only
observation
I
will
make
to
you
,
Jupe
,
in
the
way
of
influencing
*NL*
your
decision
,
is
,
that
it
is
highly
desirable
to
have
a
sound
practical
*NL*
education
,
and
that
even
your
father
himself
-LRB-
from
what
I
understand
-RRB-
*NL*
appears
,
on
your
behalf
,
to
have
known
and
felt
that
much
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
had
a
visible
effect
upon
her
.
She
stopped
in
her
wild
*NL*
crying
,
a
little
detached
herself
from
Emma
Gordon
,
and
turned
her
face
*NL*
full
upon
her
patron
.
The
whole
company
perceived
the
force
of
the
*NL*
change
,
and
drew
a
long
breath
together
,
that
plainly
said
,
`
she
will
*NL*
go
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Be
sure
you
know
your
own
mind
,
Jupe
,
'
Mr.
Gradgrind
cautioned
her
;
'
I
*NL*
say
no
more
.
Be
sure
you
know
your
own
mind
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
father
comes
back
,
'
cried
the
girl
,
bursting
into
tears
again
after
*NL*
a
minute
's
silence
,
`
how
will
he
ever
find
me
if
I
go
away
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
be
quite
at
ease
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
calmly
;
he
worked
out
the
*NL*
whole
matter
like
a
sum
:
`
you
may
be
quite
at
ease
,
Jupe
,
on
that
score
.
*NL*
In
such
a
case
,
your
father
,
I
apprehend
,
must
find
out
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
`
Must
find
out
Mr.
Sleary
,
who
would
then
let
him
know
where
you
went
.
I
*NL*
should
have
no
power
of
keeping
you
against
his
wish
,
and
he
would
have
*NL*
no
difficulty
,
at
any
time
,
in
finding
Mr.
Thomas
Gradgrind
of
Coketown
.
*NL*
I
am
well
known
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
known
,
'
assented
Mr.
Sleary
,
rolling
his
loose
eye
.
`
You
're

the

But
never

at

'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
silence
;
and
then
she
exclaimed
,
sobbing
with
her
hands
*NL*
before
her
face
,
`
Oh
,
give
me
my
clothes
,
give
me
my
clothes
,
and
let
me
*NL*
go
away
before
I
break
my
heart
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
sadly
bestirred
themselves
to
get
the
clothes
together
--
it
was
*NL*
soon
done
,
for
they
were
not
many
--
and
to
pack
them
in
a
basket
which
had
*NL*
often
travelled
with
them
.
Sissy
sat
all
the
time
upon
the
ground
,
still
*NL*
sobbing
,
and
covering
her
eyes
.
Mr.
Gradgrind
and
his
friend
Bounderby
*NL*
stood
near
the
door
,
ready
to
take
her
away
.
Mr.
Sleary
stood
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
,
with
the
male
members
of
the
company
about
him
,
*NL*
exactly
as
he
would
have
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
during
his
*NL*
daughter
Josephine
's
performance
.
He
wanted
nothing
but
his
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
basket
packed
in
silence
,
they
brought
her
bonnet
to
her
,
and
*NL*
smoothed
her
disordered
hair
,
and
put
it
on
.
Then
they
pressed
about
*NL*
her
,
and
bent
over
her
in
very
natural
attitudes
,
kissing
and
embracing
*NL*
her
:
and
brought
the
children
to
take
leave
of
her
;
and
were
a
*NL*
tender-hearted
,
simple
,
foolish
set
of
women
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Jupe
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
If
you
are
quite
determined
,
come
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
to
take
her
farewell
of
the
male
part
of
the
company
yet
,
and
*NL*
every
one
of
them
had
to
unfold
his
arms
-LRB-
for
they
all
assumed
the
*NL*
professional
attitude
when
they
found
themselves
near
Sleary
-RRB-
,
and
give
*NL*
her
a
parting
kiss
--
Master
Kidderminster
excepted
,
in
whose
young
nature
*NL*
there
was
an
original
flavour
of
the
misanthrope
,
who
was
also
known
to
*NL*
have
harboured
matrimonial
views
,
and
who
moodily
withdrew
.
Mr.
Sleary
*NL*
was
reserved
until
the
last
.
Opening
his
arms
wide
he
took
her
by
both
*NL*
her
hands
,
and
would
have
sprung
her
up
and
down
,
after
the
riding-master
*NL*
manner
of
congratulating
young
ladies
on
their
dismounting
from
a
rapid
*NL*
act
;
but
there
was
no
rebound
in
Sissy
,
and
she
only
stood
before
him
*NL*
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good-bye
,
my
dear
!
'
said
Sleary
.
`
You
'll
make
your
fortun
,
I
hope
,
and
*NL*
none
of
our
poor
folkth
will
ever
trouble

'll
pound

'
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
regarded
her
attentively
with
his
fixed
eye
,
surveyed
his
*NL*
company
with
his
loose
one
,
kissed
her
,
shook
his
head
,
and
handed
her
to
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
as
to
a
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
the
ith
,
Thquire

'
he
said
,
sweeping
her
with
a
professional
*NL*
glance
as
if
she
were
being
adjusted
in
her
seat
,
`
and
the
'll

Good-bye

'
In
a
*NL*
variety
of
voices
from
all
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
riding-master
eye
had
observed
the
bottle
of
the
nine
oils
in
her
*NL*
bosom
,
and
he
now
interposed
with
`
Leave
the
bottle

*NL*
*NL*
`
No

she
said
,
in
another
burst
of
tears
.
`
Oh

no

He
will
want

when

comes

back

He
had
never
thought
of
going
away
,
when
he
sent
me
for
it
.
I
*NL*
must
keep
it
for

The
Sleary
philosophy
was
propounded
as
they
went
downstairs
and
the
*NL*
fixed
eye
of
Philosophy
--
and
its
rolling
eye
,
too
--
soon
lost
the

in

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
MRS.
SPARSIT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
BOUNDERBY
being
a
bachelor
,
an
elderly
lady
presided
over
his
*NL*
establishment
,
in
consideration
of
a
certain
annual
stipend
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
was
this
lady
's
name
;
and
she
was
a
prominent
figure
in
*NL*
attendance
on
Mr.
Bounderby
's
car
,
as
it
rolled
along
in
triumph
with
the
*NL*
Bully
of
humility
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
had
not
only
seen
different
days
,
but
was
highly
*NL*
connected
.
She
had
a
great
aunt
living
in
these
very
times
called
Lady
*NL*
Scadgers
.
Mr.
Sparsit
,
deceased
,
of
whom
she
was
the
relict
,
had
been
by
*NL*
the
mother
's
side
what
Mrs.
Sparsit
still
called
'
a
Powler
.
'
Strangers
*NL*
of
limited
information
and
dull
apprehension
were
sometimes
observed
not
*NL*
to
know
what
a
Powler
was
,
and
even
to
appear
uncertain
whether
it
might
*NL*
be
a
business
,
or
a
political
party
,
or
a
profession
of
faith
.
The
*NL*
better
class
of
minds
,
however
,
did
not
need
to
be
informed
that
the
*NL*
Powlers
were
an
ancient
stock
,
who
could
trace
themselves
so
exceedingly
*NL*
far
back
that
it
was
not
surprising
if
they
sometimes
lost
*NL*
themselves
--
which
they
had
rather
frequently
done
,
as
respected
*NL*
horse-flesh
,
blind-hookey
,
Hebrew
monetary
transactions
,
and
the
*NL*
Insolvent
Debtors
'
Court
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
late
Mr.
Sparsit
,
being
by
the
mother
's
side
a
Powler
,
married
this
*NL*
lady
,
being
by
the
father
's
side
a
Scadgers
.
Lady
Scadgers
-LRB-
an
immensely
*NL*
fat
old
woman
,
with
an
inordinate
appetite
for
butcher
's
meat
,
and
a
*NL*
mysterious
leg
which
had
now
refused
to
get
out
of
bed
for
fourteen
*NL*
years
-RRB-
contrived
the
marriage
,
at
a
period
when
Sparsit
was
just
of
age
,
*NL*
and
chiefly
noticeable
for
a
slender
body
,
weakly
supported
on
two
long
*NL*
slim
props
,
and
surmounted
by
no
head
worth
mentioning
.
He
inherited
a
*NL*
fair
fortune
from
his
uncle
,
but
owed
it
all
before
he
came
into
it
,
and
*NL*
spent
it
twice
over
immediately
afterwards
.
Thus
,
when
he
died
,
at
*NL*
twenty-four
-LRB-
the
scene
of
his
decease
,
Calais
,
and
the
cause
,
brandy
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
did
not
leave
his
widow
,
from
whom
he
had
been
separated
soon
after
the
*NL*
honeymoon
,
in
affluent
circumstances
.
That
bereaved
lady
,
fifteen
years
*NL*
older
than
he
,
fell
presently
at
deadly
feud
with
her
only
relative
,
Lady
*NL*
Scadgers
;
and
,
partly
to
spite
her
ladyship
,
and
partly
to
maintain
*NL*
herself
,
went
out
at
a
salary
.
And
here
she
was
now
,
in
her
elderly
*NL*
days
,
with
the
Coriolanian
style
of
nose
and
the
dense
black
eyebrows
*NL*
which
had
captivated
Sparsit
,
making
Mr.
Bounderby
's
tea
as
he
took
his
*NL*
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Bounderby
had
been
a
Conqueror
,
and
Mrs.
Sparsit
a
captive
Princess
*NL*
whom
he
took
about
as
a
feature
in
his
state-processions
,
he
could
not
*NL*
have
made
a
greater
flourish
with
her
than
he
habitually
did
.
Just
as
it
*NL*
belonged
to
his
boastfulness
to
depreciate
his
own
extraction
,
so
it
*NL*
belonged
to
it
to
exalt
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
.
In
the
measure
that
he
would
not
*NL*
allow
his
own
youth
to
have
been
attended
by
a
single
favourable
*NL*
circumstance
,
he
brightened
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
juvenile
career
with
every
*NL*
possible
advantage
,
and
showered
waggon-loads
of
early
roses
all
over
*NL*
that
lady
's
path
.
`
And
yet
,
sir
,
'
he
would
say
,
`
how
does
it
turn
out
*NL*
after
all
?
Why
here
she
is
at
a
hundred
a
year
-LRB-
I
give
her
a
hundred
,
*NL*
which
she
is
pleased
to
term
handsome
-RRB-
,
keeping
the
house
of
Josiah
*NL*
Bounderby
of
Coketown
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nay
,
he
made
this
foil
of
his
so
very
widely
known
,
that
third
parties
*NL*
took
it
up
,
and
handled
it
on
some
occasions
with
considerable
briskness
.
*NL*
It
was
one
of
the
most
exasperating
attributes
of
Bounderby
,
that
he
not
*NL*
only
sang
his
own
praises
but
stimulated
other
men
to
sing
them
.
There
*NL*
was
a
moral
infection
of
clap-trap
in
him
.
Strangers
,
modest
enough
*NL*
elsewhere
,
started
up
at
dinners
in
Coketown
,
and
boasted
,
in
quite
a
*NL*
rampant
way
,
of
Bounderby
.
They
made
him
out
to
be
the
Royal
arms
,
the
*NL*
Union-Jack
,
Magna
Charta
,
John
Bull
,
Habeas
Corpus
,
the
Bill
of
Rights
,
*NL*
An
Englishman
's
house
is
his
castle
,
Church
and

,
and

save
the
*NL*
Queen
,
all
put
together
.
And
as
often
-LRB-
and
it
was
very
often
-RRB-
as
an
*NL*
orator
of
this
kind
brought
into
his
peroration

*NL*
`
Princes

flourish

A
breath

a
breath
has
made
,
'
*NL*
*NL*
--
it
was
,
for
certain
,
more
or
less
understood
among
the
company
that
he
*NL*
had
heard
of
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bounderby
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
you
are
unusually
slow
,
sir
,
with
*NL*
your
breakfast
this
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
ma'am
,
'
he
returned
,
'
I
am
thinking
about
Tom
Gradgrind
's
whim
;
'
*NL*
Tom
Gradgrind
,
for
a
bluff
independent
manner
of
speaking
--
as
if
somebody
*NL*
were
always
endeavouring
to
bribe
him
with
immense
sums
to
say
Thomas
,
*NL*
and
he
would
n't
;
`
Tom
Gradgrind
's
whim
,
ma'am
,
of
bringing
up
the
*NL*
tumbling-girl
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
girl
is
now
waiting
to
know
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
whether
she
is
to
*NL*
go
straight
to
the
school
,
or
up
to
the
Lodge
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
must
wait
,
ma'am
,
'
answered
Bounderby
,
'till
I
know
myself
.
We
*NL*
shall
have
Tom
Gradgrind
down
here
presently
,
I
suppose
.
If
he
should
*NL*
wish
her
to
remain
here
a
day
or
two
longer
,
of
course
she
can
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
she
can
if
you
wish
it
,
Mr.
Bounderby
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
told
him
I
would
give
her
a
shake-down
here
,
last
night
,
in
order
that
*NL*
he
might
sleep
on
it
before
he
decided
to
let
her
have
any
association
*NL*
with
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
,
Mr.
Bounderby
?
Very
thoughtful
of
you
!
'
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
*NL*
Coriolanian
nose
underwent
a
slight
expansion
of
the
nostrils
,
and
her
*NL*
black
eyebrows
contracted
as
she
took
a
sip
of
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
tolerably
clear
to
_
me
_
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
that
the
little
puss
can
*NL*
get
small
good
out
of
such
companionship
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
speaking
of
young
Miss
Gradgrind
,
Mr.
Bounderby
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
ma'am
,
I
'm
speaking
of
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
observation
being
limited
to
``
little
puss
,
''
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
*NL*
`
and
there
being
two
little
girls
in
question
,
I
did
not
know
which
might
*NL*
be
indicated
by
that
expression
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
,
'
repeated
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
Louisa
,
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
quite
another
father
to
Louisa
,
sir
.
'
Mrs.
Sparsit
took
a
*NL*
little
more
tea
;
and
,
as
she
bent
her
again
contracted
eyebrows
over
her
*NL*
steaming
cup
,
rather
looked
as
if
her
classical
countenance
were
invoking
*NL*
the
infernal
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
had
said
I
was
another
father
to
Tom
--
young
Tom
,
I
mean
,
not
my
*NL*
friend
Tom
Gradgrind
--
you
might
have
been
nearer
the
mark
.
I
am
going
to
*NL*
take
young
Tom
into
my
office
.
Going
to
have
him
under
my
wing
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
?
Rather
young
for
that
,
is
he
not
,
sir
?
'
Mrs.
Spirit
's
`
sir
,
'
*NL*
in
addressing
Mr.
Bounderby
,
was
a
word
of
ceremony
,
rather
exacting
*NL*
consideration
for
herself
in
the
use
,
than
honouring
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
going
to
take
him
at
once
;
he
is
to
finish
his
educational
*NL*
cramming
before
then
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
`
By
the
Lord
Harry
,
he
'll
have
*NL*
enough
of
it
,
first
and
last
!
He
'd
open
his
eyes
,
that
boy
would
,
if
he
*NL*
knew
how
empty
of
learning
_
my
_
young
maw
was
,
at
his
time
of
life
.
'
*NL*
Which
,
by
the
by
,
he
probably
did
know
,
for
he
had
heard
of
it
often
*NL*
enough
.
`
But
it
's
extraordinary
the
difficulty
I
have
on
scores
of
such
*NL*
subjects
,
in
speaking
to
any
one
on
equal
terms
.
Here
,
for
example
,
I
*NL*
have
been
speaking
to
you
this
morning
about
tumblers
.
Why
,
what
do
*NL*
_
you
_
know
about
tumblers
?
At
the
time
when
,
to
have
been
a
tumbler
in
*NL*
the
mud
of
the
streets
,
would
have
been
a
godsend
to
me
,
a
prize
in
the
*NL*
lottery
to
me
,
you
were
at
the
Italian
Opera
.
You
were
coming
out
of
the
*NL*
Italian
Opera
,
ma'am
,
in
white
satin
and
jewels
,
a
blaze
of
splendour
,
*NL*
when
I
had
n't
a
penny
to
buy
a
link
to
light
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
certainly
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
a
dignity
serenely
*NL*
mournful
,
`
was
familiar
with
the
Italian
Opera
at
a
very
early
age
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Egad
,
ma'am
,
so
was
I
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
'
--
with
the
wrong
side
of
it
.
A
*NL*
hard
bed
the
pavement
of
its
Arcade
used
to
make
,
I
assure
you
.
People
*NL*
like
you
,
ma'am
,
accustomed
from
infancy
to
lie
on
Down
feathers
,
have
no
*NL*
idea
_
how
_
hard
a
paving-stone
is
,
without
trying
it
.
No
,
no
,
it
's
of
no
*NL*
use
my
talking
to
_
you
_
about
tumblers
.
I
should
speak
of
foreign
*NL*
dancers
,
and
the
West
End
of
London
,
and
May
Fair
,
and
lords
and
ladies
*NL*
and
honourables
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
trust
,
sir
,
'
rejoined
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
decent
resignation
,
`
it
is
*NL*
not
necessary
that
you
should
do
anything
of
that
kind
.
I
hope
I
have
*NL*
learnt
how
to
accommodate
myself
to
the
changes
of
life
.
If
I
have
*NL*
acquired
an
interest
in
hearing
of
your
instructive
experiences
,
and
can
*NL*
scarcely
hear
enough
of
them
,
I
claim
no
merit
for
that
,
since
I
believe
*NL*
it
is
a
general
sentiment
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
ma'am
,
'
said
her
patron
,
`
perhaps
some
people
may
be
pleased
to
*NL*
say
that
they
do
like
to
hear
,
in
his
own
unpolished
way
,
what
Josiah
*NL*
Bounderby
,
of
Coketown
,
has
gone
through
.
But
you
must
confess
that
you
*NL*
were
born
in
the
lap
of
luxury
,
yourself
.
Come
,
ma'am
,
you
know
you
were
*NL*
born
in
the
lap
of
luxury
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
not
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
with
a
shake
of
her
head
,
`
deny
*NL*
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
was
obliged
to
get
up
from
table
,
and
stand
with
his
back
*NL*
to
the
fire
,
looking
at
her
;
she
was
such
an
enhancement
of
his
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
were
in
crack
society
.
Devilish
high
society
,
'
he
said
,
warming
*NL*
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
true
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
an
affectation
of
humility
*NL*
the
very
opposite
of
his
,
and
therefore
in
no
danger
of
jostling
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
were
in
the
tiptop
fashion
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
a
kind
of
social
widowhood
upon
*NL*
her
.
`
It
is
unquestionably
true
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
bending
himself
at
the
knees
,
literally
embraced
his
legs
*NL*
in
his
great
satisfaction
and
laughed
aloud
.
Mr.
and
Miss
Gradgrind
*NL*
being
then
announced
,
he
received
the
former
with
a
shake
of
the
hand
,
*NL*
and
the
latter
with
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Can
Jupe
be
sent
here
,
Bounderby
?
'
asked
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
.
So
Jupe
was
sent
there
.
On
coming
in
,
she
curtseyed
to
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
and
to
his
friend
Tom
Gradgrind
,
and
also
to
Louisa
;
but
in
*NL*
her
confusion
unluckily
omitted
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
Observing
this
,
the
*NL*
blustrous
Bounderby
had
the
following
remarks
to
make
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
I
tell
you
what
,
my
girl
.
The
name
of
that
lady
by
the
teapot
,
is
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
That
lady
acts
as
mistress
of
this
house
,
and
she
is
a
*NL*
highly
connected
lady
.
Consequently
,
if
ever
you
come
again
into
any
*NL*
room
in
this
house
,
you
will
make
a
short
stay
in
it
if
you
do
n't
behave
*NL*
towards
that
lady
in
your
most
respectful
manner
.
Now
,
I
do
n't
care
a
*NL*
button
what
you
do
to
_
me
_
,
because
I
do
n't
affect
to
be
anybody
.
So
far
*NL*
from
having
high
connections
I
have
no
connections
at
all
,
and
I
come
of
*NL*
the
scum
of
the
earth
.
But
towards
that
lady
,
I
do
care
what
you
do
;
and
*NL*
you
shall
do
what
is
deferential
and
respectful
,
or
you
shall
not
come
*NL*
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
,
Bounderby
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
in
a
conciliatory
voice
,
`
that
*NL*
this
was
merely
an
oversight
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
friend
Tom
Gradgrind
suggests
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
that
*NL*
this
was
merely
an
oversight
.
Very
likely
.
However
,
as
you
are
aware
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
I
do
n't
allow
of
even
oversights
towards
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
very
good
indeed
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
shaking
her
head
*NL*
with
her
State
humility
.
`
It
is
not
worth
speaking
of
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sissy
,
who
all
this
time
had
been
faintly
excusing
herself
with
tears
in
*NL*
her
eyes
,
was
now
waved
over
by
the
master
of
the
house
to
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
*NL*
She
stood
looking
intently
at
him
,
and
Louisa
stood
coldly
by
,
with
her
*NL*
eyes
upon
the
ground
,
while
he
proceeded
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jupe
,
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
take
you
into
my
house
;
and
,
when
you
*NL*
are
not
in
attendance
at
the
school
,
to
employ
you
about
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
*NL*
who
is
rather
an
invalid
.
I
have
explained
to
Miss
Louisa
--
this
is
Miss
*NL*
Louisa
--
the
miserable
but
natural
end
of
your
late
career
;
and
you
are
to
*NL*
expressly
understand
that
the
whole
of
that
subject
is
past
,
and
is
not
*NL*
to
be
referred
to
any
more
.
From
this
time
you
begin
your
history
.
You
*NL*
are
,
at
present
,
ignorant
,
I
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
very
,
'
she
answered
,
curtseying
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
causing
you
to
be
strictly
educated
;
*NL*
and
you
will
be
a
living
proof
to
all
who
come
into
communication
with
*NL*
you
,
of
the
advantages
of
the
training
you
will
receive
.
You
will
be
*NL*
reclaimed
and
formed
.
You
have
been
in
the
habit
now
of
reading
to
your
*NL*
father
,
and
those
people
I
found
you
among
,
I
dare
say
?
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
,
beckoning
her
nearer
to
him
before
he
said
so
,
and
dropping
*NL*
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
to
father
and
Merrylegs
,
sir
.
At
least
I
mean
to
father
,
when
*NL*
Merrylegs
was
always
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
Merrylegs
,
Jupe
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
with
a
passing
frown
.
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
ask
about
him
.
I
understand
you
to
have
been
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
reading
to
your
father
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
O
,
yes
,
sir
,
thousands
of
times
.
They
were
the
happiest
--
O
,
of
all
the
*NL*
happy
times
we
had
together
,
sir
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
now
when
her
sorrow
broke
out
,
that
Louisa
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
,
'
asked
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
in
a
still
lower
voice
,
`
did
you
read
to
*NL*
your
father
,
Jupe
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
the
Fairies
,
sir
,
and
the
Dwarf
,
and
the
Hunchback
,
and
the
*NL*
Genies
,
'
she
sobbed
out
;
`
and
about
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
that
is
enough
.
Never
breathe
a
word
of
*NL*
such
destructive
nonsense
any
more
.
Bounderby
,
this
is
a
case
for
rigid
*NL*
training
,
and
I
shall
observe
it
with
interest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
returned
Mr.
Bounderby
,
'
I
have
given
you
my
opinion
already
,
and
*NL*
I
should
n't
do
as
you
do
.
But
,
very
well
,
very
well
.
Since
you
are
bent
*NL*
upon
it
,
_
very
_
well
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
and
his
daughter
took
Cecilia
Jupe
off
with
them
to
*NL*
Stone
Lodge
,
and
on
the
way
Louisa
never
spoke
one
word
,
good
or
bad
.
*NL*
And
Mr.
Bounderby
went
about
his
daily
pursuits
.
And
Mrs.
Sparsit
got
*NL*
behind
her
eyebrows
and
meditated
in
the
gloom
of
that
retreat
,
all
the
*NL*

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
NEVER
WONDER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
LET
us
strike
the
key-note
again
,
before
pursuing
the
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
half
a
dozen
years
younger
,
Louisa
had
been
overheard
to
*NL*
begin
a
conversation
with
her
brother
one
day
,
by
saying
`
Tom
,
I
*NL*
wonder
'
--
upon
which
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
who
was
the
person
overhearing
,
stepped
*NL*
forth
into
the
light
and
said
,
`
Louisa
,
never
wonder
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Herein
lay
the
spring
of
the
mechanical
art
and
mystery
of
educating
the
*NL*
reason
without
stooping
to
the
cultivation
of
the
sentiments
and
*NL*
affections
.
Never
wonder
.
By
means
of
addition
,
subtraction
,
*NL*
multiplication
,
and
division
,
settle
everything
somehow
,
and
never
*NL*
wonder
.
Bring
to
me
,
says
M'Choakumchild
,
yonder
baby
just
able
to
walk
,
*NL*
and
I
will
engage
that
it
shall
never
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
besides
very
many
babies
just
able
to
walk
,
there
happened
to
be
in
*NL*
Coketown
a
considerable
population
of
babies
who
had
been
walking
against
*NL*
time
towards
the
infinite
world
,
twenty
,
thirty
,
forty
,
fifty
years
and
*NL*
more
.
These
portentous
infants
being
alarming
creatures
to
stalk
about
*NL*
in
any
human
society
,
the
eighteen
denominations
incessantly
scratched
*NL*
one
another
's
faces
and
pulled
one
another
's
hair
by
way
of
agreeing
on
*NL*
the
steps
to
be
taken
for
their
improvement
--
which
they
never
did
;
a
*NL*
surprising
circumstance
,
when
the
happy
adaptation
of
the
means
to
the
*NL*
end
is
considered
.
Still
,
although
they
differed
in
every
other
*NL*
particular
,
conceivable
and
inconceivable
-LRB-
especially
inconceivable
-RRB-
,
*NL*
they
were
pretty
well
united
on
the
point
that
these
unlucky
infants
were
*NL*
never
to
wonder
.
Body
number
one
,
said
they
must
take
everything
on
*NL*
trust
.
Body
number
two
,
said
they
must
take
everything
on
political
*NL*
economy
.
Body
number
three
,
wrote
leaden
little
books
for
them
,
showing
*NL*
how
the
good
grown-up
baby
invariably
got
to
the
Savings-bank
,
and
the
*NL*
bad
grown-up
baby
invariably
got
transported
.
Body
number
four
,
under
*NL*
dreary
pretences
of
being
droll
-LRB-
when
it
was
very
melancholy
indeed
-RRB-
,
*NL*
made
the
shallowest
pretences
of
concealing
pitfalls
of
knowledge
,
into
*NL*
which
it
was
the
duty
of
these
babies
to
be
smuggled
and
inveigled
.
But
,
*NL*
all
the
bodies
agreed
that
they
were
never
to
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
library
in
Coketown
,
to
which
general
access
was
easy
.
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
greatly
tormented
his
mind
about
what
the
people
read
in
this
*NL*
library
:
a
point
whereon
little
rivers
of
tabular
statements
periodically
*NL*
flowed
into
the
howling
ocean
of
tabular
statements
,
which
no
diver
ever
*NL*
got
to
any
depth
in
and
came
up
sane
.
It
was
a
disheartening
*NL*
circumstance
,
but
a
melancholy
fact
,
that
even
these
readers
persisted
in
*NL*
wondering
.
They
wondered
about
human
nature
,
human
passions
,
human
hopes
*NL*
and
fears
,
the
struggles
,
triumphs
and
defeats
,
the
cares
and
joys
and
*NL*
sorrows
,
the
lives
and
deaths
of
common
men
and
women
!
They
sometimes
,
*NL*
after
fifteen
hours
'
work
,
sat
down
to
read
mere
fables
about
men
and
*NL*
women
,
more
or
less
like
themselves
,
and
about
children
,
more
or
less
*NL*
like
their
own
.
They
took
De
Foe
to
their
bosoms
,
instead
of
Euclid
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
be
on
the
whole
more
comforted
by
Goldsmith
than
by
Cocker
.
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
was
for
ever
working
,
in
print
and
out
of
print
,
at
this
*NL*
eccentric
sum
,
and
he
never
could
make
out
how
it
yielded
this
*NL*
unaccountable
product
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
sick
of
my
life
,
Loo
.
I
,
hate
it
altogether
,
and
I
hate
everybody
*NL*
except
you
,
'
said
the
unnatural
young
Thomas
Gradgrind
in
the
*NL*
hair-cutting
chamber
at
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
hate
Sissy
,
Tom
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hate
to
be
obliged
to
call
her
Jupe
.
And
she
hates
me
,
'
said
Tom
,
*NL*
moodily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
she
does
not
,
Tom
,
I
am
sure
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
must
,
'
said
Tom
.
`
She
must
just
hate
and
detest
the
whole
set-out
*NL*
of
us
.
They
'll
bother
her
head
off
,
I
think
,
before
they
have
done
with
*NL*
her
.
Already
she
's
getting
as
pale
as
wax
,
and
as
heavy
as
--
I
am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Thomas
expressed
these
sentiments
sitting
astride
of
a
chair
before
*NL*
the
fire
,
with
his
arms
on
the
back
,
and
his
sulky
face
on
his
arms
.
His
*NL*
sister
sat
in
the
darker
corner
by
the
fireside
,
now
looking
at
him
,
now
*NL*
looking
at
the
bright
sparks
as
they
dropped
upon
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
to
me
,
'
said
Tom
,
tumbling
his
hair
all
manner
of
ways
with
his
sulky
*NL*
hands
,
'
I
am
a
Donkey
,
that
's
what
_
I
_
am
.
I
am
as
obstinate
as
one
,
I
*NL*
am
more
stupid
than
one
,
I
get
as
much
pleasure
as
one
,
and
I
should
like
*NL*
to
kick
like
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
me
,
I
hope
,
Tom
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Loo
;
I
would
n't
hurt
_
you
_
.
I
made
an
exception
of
you
at
first
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
this
--
jolly
old
--
Jaundiced
Jail
,
'
Tom
had
paused
to
find
a
*NL*
sufficiently
complimentary
and
expressive
name
for
the
parental
roof
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
relieve
his
mind
for
a
moment
by
the
strong
alliteration
of
*NL*
this
one
,
`
would
be
without
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
,
Tom
?
Do
you
really
and
truly
say
so
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
of
course
I
do
.
What
's
the
use
of
talking
about
it
!
'
returned
Tom
,
*NL*
chafing
his
face
on
his
coat-sleeve
,
as
if
to
mortify
his
flesh
,
and
have
*NL*
it
in
unison
with
his
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
,
Tom
,
'
said
his
sister
,
after
silently
watching
the
sparks
*NL*
awhile
,
`
as
I
get
older
,
and
nearer
growing
up
,
I
often
sit
wondering
*NL*
here
,
and
think
how
unfortunate
it
is
for
me
that
I
ca
n't
reconcile
you
*NL*
to
home
better
than
I
am
able
to
do
.
I
do
n't
know
what
other
girls
know
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
play
to
you
,
or
sing
to
you
.
I
ca
n't
talk
to
you
so
as
to
*NL*
lighten
your
mind
,
for
I
never
see
any
amusing
sights
or
read
any
amusing
*NL*
books
that
it
would
be
a
pleasure
or
a
relief
to
you
to
talk
about
,
when
*NL*
you
are
tired
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
no
more
do
I.
I
am
as
bad
as
you
in
that
respect
;
and
I
am
a
Mule
*NL*
too
,
which
you
're
not
.
If
father
was
determined
to
make
me
either
a
Prig
*NL*
or
a
Mule
,
and
I
am
not
a
Prig
,
why
,
it
stands
to
reason
,
I
must
be
a
*NL*
Mule
.
And
so
I
am
,
'
said
Tom
,
desperately
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
great
pity
,
'
said
Louisa
,
after
another
pause
,
and
speaking
*NL*
thoughtfully
out
of
her
dark
corner
:
`
it
's
a
great
pity
,
Tom
.
It
's
very
*NL*
unfortunate
for
both
of
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
You
,
'
said
Tom
;
`
you
are
a
girl
,
Loo
,
and
a
girl
comes
out
of
it
*NL*
better
than
a
boy
does
.
I
do
n't
miss
anything
in
you
.
You
are
the
only
*NL*
pleasure
I
have
--
you
can
brighten
even
this
place
--
and
you
can
always
lead
*NL*
me
as
you
like
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
a
dear
brother
,
Tom
;
and
while
you
think
I
can
do
such
things
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
so
much
mind
knowing
better
.
Though
I
do
know
better
,
Tom
,
and
am
*NL*
very
sorry
for
it
.
'
She
came
and
kissed
him
,
and
went
back
into
her
*NL*
corner
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
I
could
collect
all
the
Facts
we
hear
so
much
about
,
'
said
Tom
,
*NL*
spitefully
setting
his
teeth
,
`
and
all
the
Figures
,
and
all
the
people
*NL*
who
found
them
out
:
and
I
wish
I
could
put
a
thousand
barrels
of
*NL*
gunpowder
under
them
,
and
blow
them
all
up
together
!
However
,
when
I
go
*NL*
to
live
with
old
Bounderby
,
I
'll
have
my
revenge
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
revenge
,
Tom
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
mean
,
I
'll
enjoy
myself
a
little
,
and
go
about
and
see
something
,
and
*NL*
hear
something
.
I
'll
recompense
myself
for
the
way
in
which
I
have
been
*NL*
brought
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
do
n't
disappoint
yourself
beforehand
,
Tom
.
Mr.
Bounderby
thinks
as
*NL*
father
thinks
,
and
is
a
great
deal
rougher
,
and
not
half
so
kind
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
said
Tom
,
laughing
;
'
I
do
n't
mind
that
.
I
shall
very
well
know
how
*NL*
to
manage
and
smooth
old
Bounderby
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Their
shadows
were
defined
upon
the
wall
,
but
those
of
the
high
presses
*NL*
in
the
room
were
all
blended
together
on
the
wall
and
on
the
ceiling
,
as
*NL*
if
the
brother
and
sister
were
overhung
by
a
dark
cavern
.
Or
,
a
fanciful
*NL*
imagination
--
if
such
treason
could
have
been
there
--
might
have
made
it
out
*NL*
to
be
the
shadow
of
their
subject
,
and
of
its
lowering
association
with
*NL*
their
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
your
great
mode
of
smoothing
and
managing
,
Tom
?
Is
it
a
*NL*
secret
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
said
Tom
,
`
if
it
is
a
secret
,
it
's
not
far
off
.
It
's
you
.
You
are
*NL*
his
little
pet
,
you
are
his
favourite
;
he
'll
do
anything
for
you
.
When
*NL*
he
says
to
me
what
I
do
n't
like
,
I
shall
say
to
him
,
``
My
sister
Loo
will
*NL*
be
hurt
and
disappointed
,
Mr.
Bounderby
.
She
always
used
to
tell
me
she
*NL*
was
sure
you
would
be
easier
with
me
than
this
.
''
That
'll
bring
him
*NL*
about
,
or
nothing
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
waiting
for
some
answering
remark
,
and
getting
none
,
Tom
wearily
*NL*
relapsed
into
the
present
time
,
and
twined
himself
yawning
round
and
*NL*
about
the
rails
of
his
chair
,
and
rumpled
his
head
more
and
more
,
until
*NL*
he
suddenly
looked
up
,
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
gone
to
sleep
,
Loo
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Tom
.
I
am
looking
at
the
fire
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
seem
to
find
more
to
look
at
in
it
than
ever
I
could
find
,
'
said
*NL*
Tom
.
`
Another
of
the
advantages
,
I
suppose
,
of
being
a
girl
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tom
,
'
enquired
his
sister
,
slowly
,
and
in
a
curious
tone
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
reading
what
she
asked
in
the
fire
,
and
it
was
not
quite
plainly
written
*NL*
there
,
`
do
you
look
forward
with
any
satisfaction
to
this
change
to
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
's
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
there
's
one
thing
to
be
said
of
it
,
'
returned
Tom
,
pushing
his
*NL*
chair
from
him
,
and
standing
up
;
`
it
will
be
getting
away
from
home
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
one
thing
to
be
said
of
it
,
'
Louisa
repeated
in
her
former
*NL*
curious
tone
;
`
it
will
be
getting
away
from
home
.
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
but
what
I
shall
be
very
unwilling
,
both
to
leave
you
,
Loo
,
and
to
*NL*
leave
you
here
.
But
I
must
go
,
you
know
,
whether
I
like
it
or
not
;
and
I
*NL*
had
better
go
where
I
can
take
with
me
some
advantage
of
your
influence
,
*NL*
than
where
I
should
lose
it
altogether
.
Do
n't
you
see
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Tom
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
was
so
long
in
coming
,
though
there
was
no
indecision
in
it
,
*NL*
that
Tom
went
and
leaned
on
the
back
of
her
chair
,
to
contemplate
the
*NL*
fire
which
so
engrossed
her
,
from
her
point
of
view
,
and
see
what
he
*NL*
could
make
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Except
that
it
is
a
fire
,
'
said
Tom
,
`
it
looks
to
me
as
stupid
and
blank
*NL*
as
everything
else
looks
.
What
do
you
see
in
it
?
Not
a
circus
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
see
anything
in
it
,
Tom
,
particularly
.
But
since
I
have
been
*NL*
looking
at
it
,
I
have
been
wondering
about
you
and
me
,
grown
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wondering
again
!
'
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
such
unmanageable
thoughts
,
'
returned
his
sister
,
`
that
they
*NL*
_
will
_
wonder
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
beg
of
you
,
Louisa
,
'
said
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
who
had
opened
the
door
*NL*
without
being
heard
,
`
to
do
nothing
of
that
description
,
for
goodness
'
*NL*
sake
,
you
inconsiderate
girl
,
or
I
shall
never
hear
the
last
of
it
from
*NL*
your
father
.
And
,
Thomas
,
it
is
really
shameful
,
with
my
poor
head
*NL*
continually
wearing
me
out
,
that
a
boy
brought
up
as
you
have
been
,
and
*NL*
whose
education
has
cost
what
yours
has

should
be
found
encouraging
his
*NL*
sister
to
wonder
,
when
he
knows
his
father
has
expressly
said
that
she
is
*NL*
not
to
do
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
denied
Tom
's
participation
in
the
offence
;
but
her
mother
stopped
*NL*
her
with
the
conclusive
answer
,
`
Louisa
,
do
n't
tell
me
,
in
my
state
of
*NL*
health
;
for
unless
you
had
been
encouraged
,
it
is
morally
and
physically
*NL*
impossible
that
you
could
have
done
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
encouraged
by
nothing
,
mother
,
but
by
looking
at
the
red
sparks
*NL*
dropping
out
of
the
fire
,
and
whitening
and
dying
.
It
made
me
think
,
*NL*
after
all
,
how
short
my
life
would
be
,
and
how
little
I
could
hope
to
do
*NL*
in
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nonsense
!
'
said
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
rendered
almost
energetic
.
`
Nonsense
!
*NL*
Do
n't
stand
there
and
tell
me
such
stuff
,
Louisa
,
to
my
face
,
when
you
*NL*
know
very
well
that
if
it
was
ever
to
reach
your
father
's
ears
I
should
*NL*
never
hear
the
last
of
it
.
After
all
the
trouble
that
has
been
taken
*NL*
with
you
!
After
the
lectures
you
have
attended
,
and
the
experiments
you
*NL*
have
seen
!
After
I
have
heard
you
myself
,
when
the
whole
of
my
right
*NL*
side
has
been
benumbed
,
going
on
with
your
master
about
combustion
,
and
*NL*
calcination
,
and
calorification
,
and
I
may
say
every
kind
of
ation
that
*NL*
could
drive
a
poor
invalid
distracted
,
to
hear
you
talking
in
this
absurd
*NL*
way
about
sparks
and
ashes
!
I
wish
,
'
whimpered
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
taking
a
*NL*
chair
,
and
discharging
her
strongest
point
before
succumbing
under
these
*NL*
mere
shadows
of
facts
,
`
yes
,
I
really
_
do
_
wish
that
I
had
never
had
a
*NL*
family
,
and
then
you
would
have
known
what
it
was
to
do
without
me

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
SISSY
'S
PROGRESS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SISSY
JUPE
had
not
an
easy
time
of
it
,
between
Mr.
M'Choakumchild
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
and
was
not
without
strong
impulses
,
in
the
first
months
*NL*
of
her
probation
,
to
run
away
.
It
hailed
facts
all
day
long
so
very
*NL*
hard
,
and
life
in
general
was
opened
to
her
as
such
a
closely
ruled
*NL*
ciphering-book
,
that
assuredly
she
would
have
run
away
,
but
for
only
one
*NL*
restraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
lamentable
to
think
of
;
but
this
restraint
was
the
result
of
no
*NL*
arithmetical
process
,
was
self-imposed
in
defiance
of
all
calculation
,
*NL*
and
went
dead
against
any
table
of
probabilities
that
any
Actuary
would
*NL*
have
drawn
up
from
the
premises
.
The
girl
believed
that
her
father
had
*NL*
not
deserted
her
;
she
lived
in
the
hope
that
he
would
come
back
,
and
in
*NL*
the
faith
that
he
would
be
made
the
happier
by
her
remaining
where
she
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wretched
ignorance
with
which
Jupe
clung
to
this
consolation
,
*NL*
rejecting
the
superior
comfort
of
knowing
,
on
a
sound
arithmetical
basis
,
*NL*
that
her
father
was
an
unnatural
vagabond
,
filled
Mr.
Gradgrind
with
*NL*
pity
.
Yet
,
what
was
to
be
done
?
M'Choakumchild
reported
that
she
had
a
*NL*
very
dense
head
for
figures
;
that
,
once
possessed
with
a
general
idea
of
*NL*
the
globe
,
she
took
the
smallest
conceivable
interest
in
its
exact
*NL*
measurements
;
that
she
was
extremely
slow
in
the
acquisition
of
dates
,
*NL*
unless
some
pitiful
incident
happened
to
be
connected
therewith
;
that
she
*NL*
would
burst
into
tears
on
being
required
-LRB-
by
the
mental
process
-RRB-
*NL*
immediately
to
name
the
cost
of
two
hundred
and
forty-seven
muslin
caps
*NL*
at
fourteen-pence
halfpenny
;
that
she
was
as
low
down
,
in
the
school
,
as
*NL*
low
could
be
;
that
after
eight
weeks
of
induction
into
the
elements
of
*NL*
Political
Economy
,
she
had
only
yesterday
been
set
right
by
a
prattler
*NL*
three
feet
high
,
for
returning
to
the
question
,
`
What
is
the
first
*NL*
principle
of
this
science
?
'
the
absurd
answer
,
`
To
do
unto
others
as
I
*NL*
would
that
they
should
do
unto
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
observed
,
shaking
his
head
,
that
all
this
was
very
bad
;
*NL*
that
it
showed
the
necessity
of
infinite
grinding
at
the
mill
of
*NL*
knowledge
,
as
per
system
,
schedule
,
blue
book
,
report
,
and
tabular
*NL*
statements
A
to
Z
;
and
that
Jupe
`
must
be
kept
to
it
.
'
So
Jupe
was
kept
*NL*
to
it
,
and
became
low-spirited
,
but
no
wiser
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
be
you
,
Miss
Louisa
!
'
she
said
,
one
night
,
*NL*
when
Louisa
had
endeavoured
to
make
her
perplexities
for
next
day
*NL*
something
clearer
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
think
so
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
know
so
much
,
Miss
Louisa
.
All
that
is
difficult
to
me
now
,
*NL*
would
be
so
easy
then
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
might
not
be
the
better
for
it
,
Sissy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sissy
submitted
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
'
I
should
not
be
the
worse
,
*NL*
Miss
Louisa
.
'
To
which
Miss
Louisa
answered
,
'
I
do
n't
know
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
so
little
communication
between
these
two
--
both
because
*NL*
life
at
Stone
Lodge
went
monotonously
round
like
a
piece
of
machinery
*NL*
which
discouraged
human
interference
,
and
because
of
the
prohibition
*NL*
relative
to
Sissy
's
past
career
--
that
they
were
still
almost
strangers
.
*NL*
Sissy
,
with
her
dark
eyes
wonderingly
directed
to
Louisa
's
face
,
was
*NL*
uncertain
whether
to
say
more
or
to
remain
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
more
useful
to
my
mother
,
and
more
pleasant
with
her
than
I
can
*NL*
ever
be
,
'
Louisa
resumed
.
`
You
are
pleasanter
to
yourself
,
than
_
I
_
am
*NL*
to
_
my_self
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
if
you
please
,
Miss
Louisa
,
'
Sissy
pleaded
,
'
I
am
--
O
so
stupid
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
,
with
a
brighter
laugh
than
usual
,
told
her
she
would
be
wiser
*NL*
by-and-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
know
,
'
said
Sissy
,
half
crying
,
`
what
a
stupid
girl
I
am
.
All
*NL*
through
school
hours
I
make
mistakes
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
M'Choakumchild
call
*NL*
me
up
,
over
and
over
again
,
regularly
to
make
mistakes
.
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
them
.
They
seem
to
come
natural
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
and
Mrs.
M'Choakumchild
never
make
any
mistakes
themselves
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
Sissy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
no
!
'
she
eagerly
returned
.
`
They
know
everything
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
me
some
of
your
mistakes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
almost
ashamed
,
'
said
Sissy
,
with
reluctance
.
`
But
to-day
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
Mr.
M'Choakumchild
was
explaining
to
us
about
Natural
*NL*
Prosperity
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
National
,
I
think
it
must
have
been
,
'
observed
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
it
was
.
--
But
is
n't
it
the
same
?
'
she
timidly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
had
better
say
,
National
,
as
he
said
so
,
'
returned
Louisa
,
with
her
*NL*
dry
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
National
Prosperity
.
And
he
said
,
Now
,
this
schoolroom
is
a
Nation
.
*NL*
And
in
this
nation
,
there
are
fifty
millions
of
money
.
Is
n't
this
a
*NL*
prosperous
nation
?
Girl
number
twenty
,
is
n't
this
a
prosperous
nation
,
*NL*
and
a
'n'
t
you
in
a
thriving
state
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
did
you
say
?
'
asked
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Miss
Louisa
,
I
said
I
did
n't
know
.
I
thought
I
could
n't
know
whether
it
*NL*
was
a
prosperous
nation
or
not
,
and
whether
I
was
in
a
thriving
state
or
*NL*
not
,
unless
I
knew
who
had
got
the
money
,
and
whether
any
of
it
was
mine
.
*NL*
But
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
It
was
not
in
the
figures
at
all
,
'
*NL*
said
Sissy
,
wiping
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
was
a
great
mistake
of
yours
,
'
observed
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Miss
Louisa
,
I
know
it
was
,
now
.
Then
Mr.
M'Choakumchild
said
he
*NL*
would
try
me
again
.
And
he
said
,
This
schoolroom
is
an
immense
town
,
and
*NL*
in
it
there
are
a
million
of
inhabitants
,
and
only
five-and-twenty
are
*NL*
starved
to
death
in
the
streets
,
in
the
course
of
a
year
.
What
is
your
*NL*
remark
on
that
proportion
?
And
my
remark
was
--
for
I
could
n't
think
of
a
*NL*
better
one
--
that
I
thought
it
must
be
just
as
hard
upon
those
who
were
*NL*
starved
,
whether
the
others
were
a
million
,
or
a
million
million
.
And
*NL*
that
was
wrong
,
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
it
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
Mr.
M'Choakumchild
said
he
would
try
me
once
more
.
And
he
said
,
*NL*
Here
are
the
stutterings
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Statistics
,
'
said
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Miss
Louisa
--
they
always
remind
me
of
stutterings
,
and
that
's
*NL*
another
of
my
mistakes
--
of
accidents
upon
the
sea
.
And
I
find
-LRB-
Mr.
*NL*
M'Choakumchild
said
-RRB-
that
in
a
given
time
a
hundred
thousand
persons
went
*NL*
to
sea
on
long
voyages
,
and
only
five
hundred
of
them
were
drowned
or
*NL*
burnt
to
death
.
What
is
the
percentage
?
And
I
said
,
Miss
;
'
here
Sissy
*NL*
fairly
sobbed
as
confessing
with
extreme
contrition
to
her
greatest
*NL*
error
;
'
I
said
it
was
nothing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
Sissy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
Miss
--
to
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
people
who
were
*NL*
killed
.
I
shall
never
learn
,
'
said
Sissy
.
`
And
the
worst
of
all
is
,
*NL*
that
although
my
poor
father
wished
me
so
much
to
learn
,
and
although
I
*NL*
am
so
anxious
to
learn
,
because
he
wished
me
to
,
I
am
afraid
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
stood
looking
at
the
pretty
modest
head
,
as
it
drooped
abashed
*NL*
before
her
,
until
it
was
raised
again
to
glance
at
her
face
.
Then
she
*NL*
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
your
father
know
so
much
himself
,
that
he
wished
you
to
be
well
*NL*
taught
too
,
Sissy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sissy
hesitated
before
replying
,
and
so
plainly
showed
her
sense
that
*NL*
they
were
entering
on
forbidden
ground
,
that
Louisa
added
,
`
No
one
hears
*NL*
us
;
and
if
any
one
did
,
I
am
sure
no
harm
could
be
found
in
such
an
*NL*
innocent
question
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Miss
Louisa
,
'
answered
Sissy
,
upon
this
encouragement
,
shaking
her
*NL*
head
;
`
father
knows
very
little
indeed
.
It
's
as
much
as
he
can
do
to
*NL*
write
;
and
it
's
more
than
people
in
general
can
do
to
read
his
writing
.
*NL*
Though
it
's
plain
to
_
me
_
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
mother
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
says
she
was
quite
a
scholar
.
She
died
when
I
was
born
.
She
*NL*
was
;
'
Sissy
made
the
terrible
communication
nervously
;
`
she
was
a
*NL*
dancer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
your
father
love
her
?
'
Louisa
asked
these
questions
with
a
strong
,
*NL*
wild
,
wandering
interest
peculiar
to
her
;
an
interest
gone
astray
like
a
*NL*
banished
creature
,
and
hiding
in
solitary
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
yes
!
As
dearly
as
he
loves
me
.
Father
loved
me
,
first
,
for
her
sake
.
*NL*
He
carried
me
about
with
him
when
I
was
quite
a
baby
.
We
have
never
been
*NL*
asunder
from
that
time
.

*NL*
`
Yet
he
leaves
you
now
,
Sissy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
for
my
good
.
Nobody
understands
him
as
I
do
;
nobody
knows
him
as
I
*NL*
do
.
When
he
left
me
for
my
good
--
he
never
would
have
left
me
for
his
*NL*
own
--
I
know
he
was
almost
broken-hearted
with
the
trial
.
He
will
not
be
*NL*
happy
for
a
single
minute
,
till
he
comes
back
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
me
more
about
him
,
'
said
Louisa
,
'
I
will
never
ask
you
again
.
*NL*
Where
did
you
live
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
travelled
about
the
country
,
and
had
no
fixed
place
to
live
in
.
*NL*
Father
's
a
;
'
Sissy
whispered
the
awful
word
,
'
a
clown
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
make
the
people
laugh
?
'
said
Louisa
,
with
a
nod
of
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
But
they
would
n't
laugh
sometimes
,
and
then
father
cried
.
Lately
,
*NL*
they
very
often
would
n't
laugh
,
and
he
used
to
come
home
despairing
.
*NL*
Father
's
not
like
most
.
Those
who
did
n't
know
him
as
well
as
I
do
,
and
*NL*
did
n't
love
him
as
dearly
as
I
do
,
might
believe
he
was
not
quite
right
.
*NL*
Sometimes
they
played
tricks
upon
him
;
but
they
never
knew
how
he
felt
*NL*
them
,
and
shrunk
up
,
when
he
was
alone
with
me
.
He
was
far
,
far
timider
*NL*
than
they
thought
!

*NL*
*NL*

And
you
were
his
comfort
through
everything

*NL*
She
nodded
,
with
the
tears
rolling
down
her
face
.
'
I
hope
so
,
and
father
*NL*
said
I
was
.
It
was
because
he
grew
so
scared
and
trembling
,
and
because
*NL*
he
felt
himself
to
be
a
poor
,
weak
,
ignorant
,
helpless
man
-LRB-
those
used
to
*NL*
be
his
words
-RRB-
,
that
he
wanted
me
so
much
to
know
a
great
deal
,
and
be
*NL*
different
from
him
.
I
used
to
read
to
him
to
cheer
his
courage
,
and
he
*NL*
was
very
fond
of
that
.
They
were
wrong
books
--
I
am
never
to
speak
of
them
*NL*
here
--
but
we
did
n't
know
there
was
any
harm
in
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
he
liked
them
?
'
said
Louisa
,
with
a
searching
gaze
on
Sissy
all
this
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
very
much
!
They
kept
him
,
many
times
,
from
what
did
him
real
harm
.
*NL*
And
often
and
often
of
a
night
,
he
used
to
forget
all
his
troubles
in
*NL*
wondering
whether
the
Sultan
would
let
the
lady
go
on
with
the
story
,
or
*NL*
would
have
her
head
cut
off
before
it
was
finished
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
your
father
was
always
kind
?
To
the
last
?
'
asked
Louisa
*NL*
contravening
the
great
principle
,
and
wondering
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Always
,
always
!
'
returned
Sissy
,
clasping
her
hands
.
`
Kinder
and
kinder
*NL*
than
I
can
tell
.
He
was
angry
only
one
night
,
and
that
was
not
to
me
,
*NL*
but
Merrylegs
.
Merrylegs
;
'
she
whispered
the
awful
fact
;
`
is
his
*NL*
performing
dog
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
was
he
angry
with
the
dog
?
'
Louisa
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
soon
after
they
came
home
from
performing
,
told
Merrylegs
to
*NL*
jump
up
on
the
backs
of
the
two
chairs
and
stand
across
them
--
which
is
one
*NL*
of
his
tricks
.
He
looked
at
father
,
and
did
n't
do
it
at
once
.
*NL*
Everything
of
father
's
had
gone
wrong
that
night
,
and
he
had
n't
pleased
*NL*
the
public
at
all
.
He
cried
out
that
the
very
dog
knew
he
was
failing
,
*NL*
and
had
no
compassion
on
him
.
Then
he
beat
the
dog
,
and
I
was
*NL*
frightened
,
and
said
,
``
Father
,
father
!
Pray
do
n't
hurt
the
creature
who
*NL*
is
so
fond
of
you
!
O
Heaven
forgive
you
,
father
,
stop
!
''
And
he
stopped
,
*NL*
and
the
dog
was
bloody
,
and
father
lay
down
crying
on
the
floor
with
the
*NL*
dog
in
his
arms
,
and
the
dog
licked
his
face
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
saw
that
she
was
sobbing
;
and
going
to
her
,
kissed
her
,
took
her
*NL*
hand
,
and
sat
down
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Finish
by
telling
me
how
your
father
left
you
,
Sissy
.
Now
that
I
have
*NL*
asked
you
so
much
,
tell
me
the
end
.
The
blame
,
if
there
is
any
blame
,
is
*NL*
mine
,
not
yours
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
Miss
Louisa
,
'
said
Sissy
,
covering
her
eyes
,
and
sobbing
yet
;
'
I
*NL*
came
home
from
the
school
that
afternoon
,
and
found
poor
father
just
come
*NL*
home
too
,
from
the
booth
.
And
he
sat
rocking
himself
over
the
fire
,
as
*NL*
if
he
was
in
pain
.
And
I
said
,
``
Have
you
hurt
yourself
,
father
?
''
-LRB-
as
he
*NL*
did
sometimes
,
like
they
all
did
-RRB-
,
and
he
said
,
``
A
little
,
my
darling
.
''
*NL*
And
when
I
came
to
stoop
down
and
look
up
at
his
face
,
I
saw
that
he
was
*NL*
crying
.
The
more
I
spoke
to
him
,
the
more
he
hid
his
face
;
and
at
first
*NL*
he
shook
all
over
,
and
said
nothing
but
``
My
darling
;
''
and
``
My
love
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Tom
came
lounging
in
,
and
stared
at
the
two
with
a
coolness
not
*NL*
particularly
savouring
of
interest
in
anything
but
himself
,
and
not
much
*NL*
of
that
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
asking
Sissy
a
few
questions
,
Tom
,
'
observed
his
sister
.
`
You
have
*NL*
no
occasion
to
go
away
;
but
do
n't
interrupt
us
for
a
moment
,
Tom
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
very
well
!
'
returned
Tom
.
`
Only
father
has
brought
old
Bounderby
*NL*
home
,
and
I
want
you
to
come
into
the
drawing-room
.
Because
if
you
come
,
*NL*
there
's
a
good
chance
of
old
Bounderby
's
asking
me
to
dinner
;
and
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
,
there
's
none
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
come
directly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
wait
for
you
,
'
said
Tom
,
`
to
make
sure
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sissy
resumed
in
a
lower
voice
.
`
At
last
poor
father
said
that
he
had
*NL*
given
no
satisfaction
again
,
and
never
did
give
any
satisfaction
now
,
and
*NL*
that
he
was
a
shame
and
disgrace
,
and
I
should
have
done
better
without
*NL*
him
all
along
.
I
said
all
the
affectionate
things
to
him
that
came
into
*NL*
my
heart
,
and
presently
he
was
quiet
and
I
sat
down
by
him
,
and
told
him
*NL*
all
about
the
school
and
everything
that
had
been
said
and
done
there
.
*NL*
When
I
had
no
more
left
to
tell
,
he
put
his
arms
round
my
neck
,
and
*NL*
kissed
me
a
great
many
times
.
Then
he
asked
me
to
fetch
some
of
the
*NL*
stuff
he
used
,
for
the
little
hurt
he
had
had
,
and
to
get
it
at
the
best
*NL*
place
,
which
was
at
the
other
end
of
town
from
there
;
and
then
,
after
*NL*
kissing
me
again
,
he
let
me
go
.
When
I
had
gone
down-stairs
,
I
turned
*NL*
back
that
I
might
be
a
little
bit
more
company
to
him
yet
,
and
looked
in
*NL*
at
the
door
,
and
said
,
``
Father
dear
,
shall
I
take
Merrylegs
?
''
Father
*NL*
shook
his
head
and
said
,
``
No
,
Sissy
,
no
;
take
nothing
that
's
known
to
be
*NL*
mine
,
my
darling
;
''
and
I
left
him
sitting
by
the
fire
.
Then
the
thought
*NL*
must
have
come
upon
him
,
poor
,
poor
father
!
of
going
away
to
try
*NL*
something
for
my
sake
;
for
when
I
came
back
,
he
was
gone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
!
Look
sharp
for
old
Bounderby
,
Loo
!
'
Tom
remonstrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
no
more
to
tell
,
Miss
Louisa
.
I
keep
the
nine
oils
ready
for
*NL*
him
,
and
I
know
he
will
come
back
.
Every
letter
that
I
see
in
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
's
hand
takes
my
breath
away
and
blinds
my
eyes
,
for
I
think
it
*NL*
comes
from
father
,
or
from
Mr.
Sleary
about
father
.
Mr.
Sleary
promised
*NL*
to
write
as
soon
as
ever
father
should
be
heard
of
,
and
I
trust
to
him
to
*NL*
keep
his
word
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
look
sharp
for
old
Bounderby
,
Loo
!
'
said
Tom
,
with
an
impatient
*NL*
whistle
.
`
He
'll
be
off
if
you
do
n't
look
sharp
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
whenever
Sissy
dropped
a
curtsey
to
Mr.
Gradgrind
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
his
family
,
and
said
in
a
faltering
way
,
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
*NL*
sir
,
for
being
troublesome
--
but
--
have
you
had
any
letter
yet
about
me
?
'
*NL*
Louisa
would
suspend
the
occupation
of
the
moment
,
whatever
it
was
,
and
*NL*
look
for
the
reply
as
earnestly
as
Sissy
did
.
And
when
Mr.
Gradgrind
*NL*
regularly
answered
,
`
No
,
Jupe
,
nothing
of
the
sort
,
'
the
trembling
of
*NL*
Sissy
's
lip
would
be
repeated
in
Louisa
's
face
,
and
her
eyes
would
follow
*NL*
Sissy
with
compassion
to
the
door
.
Mr.
Gradgrind
usually
improved
these
*NL*
occasions
by
remarking
,
when
she
was
gone
,
that
if
Jupe
had
been
properly
*NL*
trained
from
an
early
age
she
would
have
remonstrated
to
herself
on
sound
*NL*
principles
the
baselessness
of
these
fantastic
hopes
.
Yet
it
did
seem
*NL*
-LRB-
though
not
to
him
,
for
he
saw
nothing
of
it
-RRB-
as
if
fantastic
hope
could
*NL*
take
as
strong
a
hold
as
Fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
observation
must
be
limited
exclusively
to
his
daughter
.
As
to
Tom
,
*NL*
he
was
becoming
that
not
unprecedented
triumph
of
calculation
which
is
*NL*
usually
at
work
on
number
one
.
As
to
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
if
she
said
*NL*
anything
on
the
subject
,
she
would
come
a
little
way
out
of
her
wrappers
,
*NL*
like
a
feminine
dormouse
,
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
gracious
bless
me
,
how
my
poor
head
is
vexed
and
worried
by
that
*NL*
girl
Jupe
's
so
perseveringly
asking
,
over
and
over
again
,
about
her
*NL*
tiresome
letters
!
Upon
my
word
and
honour
I
seem
to
be
fated
,
and
*NL*
destined
,
and
ordained
,
to
live
in
the
midst
of
things
that
I
am
never
to
*NL*
hear
the
last
of
.
It
really
is
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
that
it
*NL*
appears
as
if
I
never
was
to
hear
the
last
of
anything
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
this
point
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
's
eye
would
fall
upon
her
;
and
under
*NL*
the
influence
of
that
wintry
piece
of
fact
,
she
would
become
torpid
*NL*
again
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
STEPHEN
BLACKPOOL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
ENTERTAIN
a
weak
idea
that
the
English
people
are
as
hard-worked
as
any
*NL*
people
upon
whom
the
sun
shines
.
I
acknowledge
to
this
ridiculous
*NL*
idiosyncrasy
,
as
a
reason
why
I
would
give
them
a
little
more
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hardest
working
part
of
Coketown
;
in
the
innermost
fortifications
*NL*
of
that
ugly
citadel
,
where
Nature
was
as
strongly
bricked
out
as
killing
*NL*
airs
and
gases
were
bricked
in
;
at
the
heart
of
the
labyrinth
of
narrow
*NL*
courts
upon
courts
,
and
close
streets
upon
streets
,
which
had
come
into
*NL*
existence
piecemeal
,
every
piece
in
a
violent
hurry
for
some
one
man
's
*NL*
purpose
,
and
the
whole
an
unnatural
family
,
shouldering
,
and
trampling
,
*NL*
and
pressing
one
another
to
death
;
in
the
last
close
nook
of
this
great
*NL*
exhausted
receiver
,
where
the
chimneys
,
for
want
of
air
to
make
a
*NL*
draught
,
were
built
in
an
immense
variety
of
stunted
and
crooked
shapes
,
*NL*
as
though
every
house
put
out
a
sign
of
the
kind
of
people
who
might
be
*NL*
expected
to
be
born
in
it
;
among
the
multitude
of
Coketown
,
generically
*NL*
called
`
the
Hands
,
'
--
a
race
who
would
have
found
more
favour
with
some
*NL*
people
,
if
Providence
had
seen
fit
to
make
them
only
hands
,
or
,
like
the
*NL*
lower
creatures
of
the
seashore
,
only
hands
and
stomachs
--
lived
a
certain
*NL*
Stephen
Blackpool
,
forty
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
looked
older
,
but
he
had
had
a
hard
life
.
It
is
said
that
every
*NL*
life
has
its
roses
and
thorns
;
there
seemed
,
however
,
to
have
been
a
*NL*
misadventure
or
mistake
in
Stephen
's
case
,
whereby
somebody
else
had
*NL*
become
possessed
of
his
roses
,
and
he
had
become
possessed
of
the
same
*NL*
somebody
else
's
thorns
in
addition
to
his
own
.
He
had
known
,
to
use
his
*NL*
words
,
a
peck
of
trouble
.
He
was
usually
called
Old
Stephen
,
in
a
kind
*NL*
of
rough
homage
to
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rather
stooping
man
,
with
a
knitted
brow
,
a
pondering
expression
of
*NL*
face
,
and
a
hard-looking
head
sufficiently
capacious
,
on
which
his
*NL*
iron-grey
hair
lay
long
and
thin
,
Old
Stephen
might
have
passed
for
a
*NL*
particularly
intelligent
man
in
his
condition
.
Yet
he
was
not
.
He
took
*NL*
no
place
among
those
remarkable
`
Hands
,
'
who
,
piecing
together
their
*NL*
broken
intervals
of
leisure
through
many
years
,
had
mastered
difficult
*NL*
sciences
,
and
acquired
a
knowledge
of
most
unlikely
things
.
He
held
no
*NL*
station
among
the
Hands
who
could
make
speeches
and
carry
on
debates
.
*NL*
Thousands
of
his
compeers
could
talk
much
better
than
he
,
at
any
time
.
*NL*
He
was
a
good
power-loom
weaver
,
and
a
man
of
perfect
integrity
.
What
*NL*
more
he
was
,
or
what
else
he
had
in
him
,
if
anything
,
let
him
show
for
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lights
in
the
great
factories
,
which
looked
,
when
they
were
*NL*
illuminated
,
like
Fairy
palaces
--
or
the
travellers
by
express-train
said
*NL*
so
--
were
all
extinguished
;
and
the
bells
had
rung
for
knocking
off
for
the
*NL*
night
,
and
had
ceased
again
;
and
the
Hands
,
men
and
women
,
boy
and
girl
,
*NL*
were
clattering
home
.
Old
Stephen
was
standing
in
the
street
,
with
the
*NL*
old
sensation
upon
him
which
the
stoppage
of
the
machinery
always
*NL*
produced
--
the
sensation
of
its
having
worked
and
stopped
in
his
own
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yet
I
do
n't
see
Rachael
,
still
!
'
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
wet
night
,
and
many
groups
of
young
women
passed
him
,
with
their
*NL*
shawls
drawn
over
their
bare
heads
and
held
close
under
their
chins
to
*NL*
keep
the
rain
out
.
He
knew
Rachael
well
,
for
a
glance
at
any
one
of
*NL*
these
groups
was
sufficient
to
show
him
that
she
was
not
there
.
At
last
,
*NL*
there
were
no
more
to
come
;
and
then
he
turned
away
,
saying
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
disappointment
,
`
Why
,
then
,
ha
'
missed
her
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
he
had
not
gone
the
length
of
three
streets
,
when
he
saw
another
of
*NL*
the
shawled
figures
in
advance
of
him
,
at
which
he
looked
so
keenly
that
*NL*
perhaps
its
mere
shadow
indistinctly
reflected
on
the
wet
pavement
--
if
he
*NL*
could
have
seen
it
without
the
figure
itself
moving
along
from
lamp
to
*NL*
lamp
,
brightening
and
fading
as
it
went
--
would
have
been
enough
to
tell
*NL*
him
who
was
there
.
Making
his
pace
at
once
much
quicker
and
much
softer
,
*NL*
he
darted
on
until
he
was
very
near
this
figure
,
then
fell
into
his
*NL*
former
walk
,
and
called
`
Rachael
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
,
being
then
in
the
brightness
of
a
lamp
;
and
raising
her
hood
*NL*
a
little
,
showed
a
quiet
oval
face
,
dark
and
rather
delicate
,
irradiated
*NL*
by
a
pair
of
very
gentle
eyes
,
and
further
set
off
by
the
perfect
order
*NL*
of
her
shining
black
hair
.
It
was
not
a
face
in
its
first
bloom
;
she
was
*NL*
a
woman
five
and
thirty
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
lad
!
'T
is
thou
?
'
When
she
had
said
this
,
with
a
smile
which
would
*NL*
have
been
quite
expressed
,
though
nothing
of
her
had
been
seen
but
her
*NL*
pleasant
eyes
,
she
replaced
her
hood
again
,
and
they
went
on
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
thou
wast
ahind
me
,
Rachael
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No

never

*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor

Rachael

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Stephen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
with
some
disappointment
in
his
face
,
but
with
a
*NL*
respectful
and
patient
conviction
that
she
must
be
right
in
whatever
she
*NL*
did
.
The
expression
was
not
lost
upon
her
;
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
*NL*
his
arm
a
moment
as
if
to
thank
him
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
are
such
true
friends
,
lad
,
and
such
old
friends

now

*NL*
`
No

Rachael
,
thou
`
rt
as
young
as
ever
thou
wast
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
One
of
us
would
be
puzzled
how
to
get
old
,
Stephen
,
without
'
t
other
*NL*
getting
so
too
,
both
being
alive
,
'
she
answered
,
laughing
;
`
but
,
anyways
,
*NL*
we
're
such
old
friends
,
and
t
'
hide
a
word
of
honest
truth
fro
'
one
*NL*
another
would
be
a
sin
and
a
pity
.
'T
is
better
not
to
walk
too
much
*NL*
together
.
`
Times
,
yes
!
`
Twould
be
hard
,
indeed
,
if
't
was
not
to
be
at
*NL*
all
,
'
she
said
,
with
a
cheerfulness
she
sought
to
communicate
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
Tis
hard
,
anyways
,
Rachael
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Try
to
think
not
;
and
`

seem

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
tried
a
long
time

got
better

But
thou
`

right
;
'
t
*NL*
might
mak
fok
talk

even
of
thee
.
Thou
hast
been
that
to
me
,
Rachael
,
*NL*
through
so
many
year
:
thou
hast
done
me
so
much
good
,
and
heartened
of
me
*NL*
in
that
cheering
way
,
that
thy
word
is
a
law
to
me
.
Ah
,
lass
,
and
a
*NL*
bright
good
law
!
Better
than
some
real
ones
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
fret
about
them
,
Stephen
,
'
she
answered
quickly
,
and
not
without
*NL*
an
anxious
glance
at
his
face
.
`
Let
the
laws
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
he
said
,
with
a
slow
nod
or
two
.
`
Let
'em
be
.
Let
everything
be
.
*NL*
Let
all
sorts
alone
.
'T
is
a
muddle
,
and
that
's
aw
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Always
a
muddle
?
'
said
Rachael
,
with
another
gentle
touch
upon
his
arm
,
*NL*
as
if
to
recall
him
out
of
the
thoughtfulness
,
in
which
he
was
biting
the
*NL*
long
ends
of
his
loose
neckerchief
as
he
walked
along
.
The
touch
had
its
*NL*
instantaneous
effect
.
He
let
them
fall
,
turned
a
smiling
face
upon
her
,
*NL*
and
said
,
as
he
broke
into
a
good-humoured
laugh
,
`
Ay
,
Rachael
,
lass
,
*NL*
awlus
a
muddle
.
That
's
where
I
stick
.
I
come
to
the
muddle
many
times
*NL*
and
agen
,
and
I
never
get
beyond
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
walked
some
distance
,
and
were
near
their
own
homes
.
The
*NL*
woman
's
was
the
first
reached
.
It
was
in
one
of
the
many
small
streets
*NL*
for
which
the
favourite
undertaker
-LRB-
who
turned
a
handsome
sum
out
of
the
*NL*
one
poor
ghastly
pomp
of
the
neighbourhood
-RRB-
kept
a
black
ladder
,
in
order
*NL*
that
those
who
had
done
their
daily
groping
up
and
down
the
narrow
stairs
*NL*
might
slide
out
of
this
working
world
by
the
windows
.
She
stopped
at
the
*NL*
corner
,
and
putting
her
hand
in
his
,
wished
him
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
night
,
dear
lass
;
good
night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
,
with
her
neat
figure
and
her
sober
womanly
step
,
down
the
dark
*NL*
street
,
and
he
stood
looking
after
her
until
she
turned
into
one
of
the
*NL*
small
houses
.
There
was
not
a
flutter
of
her
coarse
shawl
,
perhaps
,
but
*NL*
had
its
interest
in
this
man
's
eyes
;
not
a
tone
of
her
voice
but
had
its
*NL*
echo
in
his
innermost
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
lost
to
his
view
,
he
pursued
his
homeward
way
,
glancing
up
*NL*
sometimes
at
the
sky
,
where
the
clouds
were
sailing
fast
and
wildly
.
*NL*
But
,
they
were
broken
now
,
and
the
rain
had
ceased
,
and
the
moon
*NL*
shone
,
--
looking
down
the
high
chimneys
of
Coketown
on
the
deep
furnaces
*NL*
below
,
and
casting
Titanic
shadows
of
the
steam-engines
at
rest
,
upon
the
*NL*
walls
where
they
were
lodged
.
The
man
seemed
to
have
brightened
with
the
*NL*
night
,
as
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
home
,
in
such
another
street
as
the
first
,
saving
that
it
was
*NL*
narrower
,
was
over
a
little
shop
.
How
it
came
to
pass
that
any
people
*NL*
found
it
worth
their
while
to
sell
or
buy
the
wretched
little
toys
,
mixed
*NL*
up
in
its
window
with
cheap
newspapers
and
pork
-LRB-
there
was
a
leg
to
be
*NL*
raffled
for
to-morrow-night
-RRB-
,
matters
not
here
.
He
took
his
end
of
*NL*
candle
from
a
shelf
,
lighted
it
at
another
end
of
candle
on
the
counter
,
*NL*
without
disturbing
the
mistress
of
the
shop
who
was
asleep
in
her
little
*NL*
room
,
and
went
upstairs
into
his
lodging
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
room
,
not
unacquainted
with
the
black
ladder
under
various
*NL*
tenants
;
but
as
neat
,
at
present
,
as
such
a
room
could
be
.
A
few
books
*NL*
and
writings
were
on
an
old
bureau
in
a
corner
,
the
furniture
was
decent
*NL*
and
sufficient
,
and
,
though
the
atmosphere
was
tainted
,
the
room
was
*NL*
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
to
the
hearth
to
set
the
candle
down
upon
a
round
three-legged
*NL*
table
standing
there
,
he
stumbled
against
something
.
As
he
recoiled
,
*NL*
looking
down
at
it
,
it
raised
itself
up
into
the
form
of
a
woman
in
a
*NL*
sitting
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heaven
's
mercy
,
woman
!
'
he
cried
,
falling
farther
off
from
the
figure
.
*NL*
`
Hast
thou
come
back
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
woman
!
A
disabled
,
drunken
creature
,
barely
able
to
preserve
her
*NL*
sitting
posture
by
steadying
herself
with
one
begrimed
hand
on
the
floor
,
*NL*
while
the
other
was
so
purposeless
in
trying
to
push
away
her
tangled
*NL*
hair
from
her
face
,
that
it
only
blinded
her
the
more
with
the
dirt
upon
*NL*
it
.
A
creature
so
foul
to
look
at
,
in
her
tatters
,
stains
and
splashes
,
*NL*
but
so
much
fouler
than
that
in
her
moral
infamy
,
that
it
was
a
shameful
*NL*
thing
even
to
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
impatient
oath
or
two
,
and
some
stupid
clawing
of
herself
with
*NL*
the
hand
not
necessary
to
her
support
,
she
got
her
hair
away
from
her
*NL*
eyes
sufficiently
to
obtain
a
sight
of
him
.
Then
she
sat
swaying
her
*NL*
body
to
and
fro
,
and
making
gestures
with
her
unnerved
arm
,
which
seemed
*NL*
intended
as
the
accompaniment
to
a
fit
of
laughter
,
though
her
face
was
*NL*
stolid
and
drowsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Eigh
,
lad
?
What
,
yo
'
r
there
?
'
Some
hoarse
sounds
meant
for
this
,
came
*NL*
mockingly
out
of
her
at
last
;
and
her
head
dropped
forward
on
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Back
agen
?
'
she
screeched
,
after
some
minutes
,
as
if
he
had
that
moment
*NL*
said
it
.
`
Yes
!
And
back
agen
.
Back
agen
ever
and
ever
so
often
.
Back
?
*NL*
Yes
,
back
.
Why
not
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Roused
by
the
unmeaning
violence
with
which
she
cried
it
out
,
she
*NL*
scrambled
up
,
and
stood
supporting
herself
with
her
shoulders
against
the
*NL*
wall
;
dangling
in
one
hand
by
the
string
,
a
dunghill-fragment
of
a
*NL*
bonnet
,
and
trying
to
look
scornfully
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
sell
thee
off
again
,
and
I
'll
sell
thee
off
again
,
and
I
'll
sell
*NL*
thee
off
a
score
of
times
!
'
she
cried
,
with
something
between
a
furious
*NL*
menace
and
an
effort
at
a
defiant
dance
.
`
Come
awa
'
from
th
'
bed
!
'
He
*NL*
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
it
,
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
.
`
Come
*NL*
awa
!
from
`
t.
'T
is
mine
,
and
I
've
a
right
to
t
'
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
staggered
to
it
,
he
avoided
her
with
a
shudder
,
and
passed
--
his
*NL*
face
still
hidden
--
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
.
She
threw
herself
*NL*
upon
the
bed
heavily
,
and
soon
was
snoring
hard
.
He
sunk
into
a
chair
,
*NL*
and
moved
but
once
all
that
night
.
It
was
to
throw
a
covering
over
her
;
*NL*
as
if
his
hands
were
not
enough
to
hide
her
,
even
in
the
darkness
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
NO
WAY
OUT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
Fairy
palaces
burst
into
illumination
,
before
pale
morning
showed
the
*NL*
monstrous
serpents
of
smoke
trailing
themselves
over
Coketown
.
A
*NL*
clattering
of
clogs
upon
the
pavement
;
a
rapid
ringing
of
bells
;
and
all
*NL*
the
melancholy
mad
elephants
,
polished
and
oiled
up
for
the
day
's
*NL*
monotony
,
were
at
their
heavy
exercise
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
bent
over
his
loom
,
quiet
,
watchful
,
and
steady
.
A
special
*NL*
contrast
,
as
every
man
was
in
the
forest
of
looms
where
Stephen
worked
,
*NL*
to
the
crashing
,
smashing
,
tearing
piece
of
mechanism
at
which
he
*NL*
laboured
.
Never
fear
,
good
people
of
an
anxious
turn
of
mind
,
that
Art
*NL*
will
consign
Nature
to
oblivion
.
Set
anywhere
,
side
by
side
,
the
work
of
*NL*
GOD
and
the
work
of
man
;
and
the
former
,
even
though
it
be
a
troop
of
*NL*
Hands
of
very
small
account
,
will
gain
in
dignity
from
the
comparison
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
many
hundred
Hands
in
this
Mill
;
so
many
hundred
horse
Steam
Power
.
*NL*
It
is
known
,
to
the
force
of
a
single
pound
weight
,
what
the
engine
will
*NL*
do
;
but
,
not
all
the
calculators
of
the
National
Debt
can
tell
me
the
*NL*
capacity
for
good
or
evil
,
for
love
or
hatred
,
for
patriotism
or
*NL*
discontent
,
for
the
decomposition
of
virtue
into
vice
,
or
the
reverse
,
at
*NL*
any
single
moment
in
the
soul
of
one
of
these
its
quiet
servants
,
with
*NL*
the
composed
faces
and
the
regulated
actions
.
There
is
no
mystery
in
it
;
*NL*
there
is
an
unfathomable
mystery
in
the
meanest
of
them
,
for
*NL*
ever
.
--
Supposing
we
were
to
reverse
our
arithmetic
for
material
objects
,
*NL*
and
to
govern
these
awful
unknown
quantities
by
other
means
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
grew
strong
,
and
showed
itself
outside
,
even
against
the
flaming
*NL*
lights
within
.
The
lights
were
turned
out
,
and
the
work
went
on
.
The
*NL*
rain
fell
,
and
the
Smoke-serpents
,
submissive
to
the
curse
of
all
that
*NL*
tribe
,
trailed
themselves
upon
the
earth
.
In
the
waste-yard
outside
,
the
*NL*
steam
from
the
escape
pipe
,
the
litter
of
barrels
and
old
iron
,
the
*NL*
shining
heaps
of
coals
,
the
ashes
everywhere
,
were
shrouded
in
a
veil
of
*NL*
mist
and
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
work
went
on
,
until
the
noon-bell
rang
.
More
clattering
upon
the
*NL*
pavements
.
The
looms
,
and
wheels
,
and
Hands
all
out
of
gear
for
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
came
out
of
the
hot
mill
into
the
damp
wind
and
cold
wet
streets
,
*NL*
haggard
and
worn
.
He
turned
from
his
own
class
and
his
own
quarter
,
*NL*
taking
nothing
but
a
little
bread
as
he
walked
along
,
towards
the
hill
on
*NL*
which
his
principal
employer
lived
,
in
a
red
house
with
black
outside
*NL*
shutters
,
green
inside
blinds
,
a
black
street
door
,
up
two
white
steps
,
*NL*
BOUNDERBY
-LRB-
in
letters
very
like
himself
-RRB-
upon
a
brazen
plate
,
and
a
round
*NL*
brazen
door-handle
underneath
it
,
like

*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
was
at
his
lunch
.
So
Stephen
had
expected
.
Would
his
*NL*
servant
say
that
one
of
the
Hands
begged
leave
to
speak
to
him
?
Message
*NL*
in
return
,
requiring
name
of
such
Hand

Stephen
Blackpool
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
troublesome
against
Stephen
Blackpool
;
yes
,
he
might
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
Blackpool
in
the
parlour
.
Mr.
Bounderby
-LRB-
whom
he
just
knew
by
*NL*
sight
-RRB-
,
at
lunch
on
chop
and
sherry
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
netting
at
the
*NL*
fireside
,
in
a
side-saddle
attitude
,
with
one
foot
in
a
cotton
stirrup
.
*NL*
It
was
a
part
,
at
once
of
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
dignity
and
service
,
not
to
*NL*
lunch
.
She
supervised
the
meal
officially
,
but
implied
that
in
her
own
*NL*
stately
person
she
considered
lunch
a
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Stephen
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
what
's
the
matter
with
_
you
_
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
made
a
bow
.
Not
a
servile
one
--
these
Hands
will
never
do
that
!
*NL*
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
,
you
'll
never
catch
them
at
that
,
if
they
have
been
*NL*
with
you
twenty
years
!
--
and
,
as
a
complimentary
toilet
for
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
*NL*
tucked
his
neckerchief
ends
into
his
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
you
know
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
taking
some
sherry
,
`
we
have
never
*NL*
had
any
difficulty
with
you
,
and
you
have
never
been
one
of
the
*NL*
unreasonable
ones
.
You
do
n't
expect
to
be
set
up
in
a
coach
and
six
,
and
*NL*
to
be
fed
on
turtle
soup
and
venison
,
with
a
gold
spoon
,
as
a
good
many
*NL*
of
'em
do
!
'
Mr.
Bounderby
always
represented
this
to
be
the
sole
,
*NL*
immediate
,
and
direct
object
of
any
Hand
who
was
not
entirely
satisfied
;
*NL*
`
and
therefore
I
know
already
that
you
have
not
come
here
to
make
a
*NL*
complaint
.
Now
,
you
know
,
I
am
certain
of
that
,
beforehand

*NL*
*NL*
`
No

I

'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
seemed
agreeably
surprised
,
notwithstanding
his
previous
*NL*
strong
conviction
.
`
Very
well
,
'
he
returned
.
`
You
're
a
steady
Hand
,
and
*NL*
I
was
not
mistaken
.
Now
,
let
me
hear
what
it
's
all
about
.
As
it
's
not
*NL*
that
,
let
me
hear
what
it
is
.
What
have
you
got
to
say
?
Out
with
it
,
*NL*
lad
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
happened
to
glance
towards
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
'
I
can
go
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
if
you
wish
it
,
'
said
that
self-sacrificing
lady
,
making
a
*NL*
feint
of
taking
her
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
stayed
her
,
by
holding
a
mouthful
of
chop
in
suspension
*NL*
before
swallowing
it
,
and
putting
out
his
left
hand
.
Then
,
withdrawing
*NL*
his
hand
and
swallowing
his
mouthful
of
chop
,
he
said
to
Stephen
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
you
know
,
this
good
lady
is
a
born
lady
,
a
high
lady
.
You
are
not
*NL*
to
suppose
because
she
keeps
my
house
for
me
,
that
she
has
n't
been
very
*NL*
high
up
the
tree
--
ah
,
up
at
the
top
of
the
tree
!
Now
,
if
you
have
got
*NL*
anything
to
say
that
ca
n't
be
said
before
a
born
lady
,
this

will
*NL*
leave
the
room

If

this

*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir

I

,
'
was
the
reply
,
accompanied
with
a
slight
flush
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
well

'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
pushing
away
his
plate
,
and
leaning
*NL*
back
.
`
Fire
away
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I

,
'
Stephen
began
,
raising
his
eyes
from
the
floor
,
after
a
*NL*
moment
's
consideration
,
`
to
ask
yo
yor
advice
.
I
need
'
t
overmuch
.
I
*NL*
were
married
on
Eas
'
r
Monday
nineteen

long
and
dree

She
were
*NL*
a
young
lass
--
pretty
enow
--
wi
'
good
accounts
of
herseln
.
Well
!
She
went
*NL*
bad
--
soon
.
Not
along
of
me
.
Gonnows
I
were
not
a
unkind
husband
to
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
heard
all
this
before
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
She
took
to
*NL*
drinking
,
left
off
working
,
sold
the
furniture
,
pawned
the
clothes
,
and
*NL*
played
old
Gooseberry
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
were
patient
wi
'
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
`
The
more
fool
you

I
think
,
'
said
Mr.

,
in
confidence
to
his
*NL*
wine-glass
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
were
very
patient
wi
'
her
.
I
tried
to
wean
her
fra

ower
and
ower
*NL*
agen

I
tried
this
,
I
tried
that
,
I
tried
t
`
other
.
I
ha
'
gone
home
,
*NL*
many
's
the
time
,
and
found
all
vanished
as
I
had
in
the
world
,
and
her
*NL*
without
a
sense
left
to
bless
herseln
lying
on
bare
ground
.
I
ha
'
dun
'
t
*NL*
not
once
,
not
twice
--
twenty
time
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Every
line
in
his
face
deepened
as
he
said
it
,
and
put
in
its
affecting
*NL*
evidence
of
the
suffering
he
had
undergone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
From
bad
to
worse

from

She

She

What

hinder

I

nights
long

ere

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
easily
ambling
along
with
her
netting-needles
,
raised
the
*NL*
Coriolanian
eyebrows
and
shook
her
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
`
The
great

Please

*NL*

hard

*NL*
not
ashamed

fearfo

a
'
the

o

Last
night
,
I
went
*NL*
home
.
There
she
lay
upon
my
har-stone
!
There
she
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
strength
of
his
misfortune
,
and
the
energy
of
his
distress
,
he
*NL*
fired
for
the
moment
like
a
proud
man
.
In
another
moment
,
he
stood
as
he
*NL*
had
stood
all
the
time
--
his
usual
stoop
upon
him
;
his
pondering
face
*NL*
addressed
to
Mr.
Bounderby
,
with
a
curious
expression
on
it
,
half
shrewd
,
*NL*
half
perplexed
,
as
if
his
mind
were
set
upon
unravelling
something
very
*NL*
difficult
;
his
hat
held
tight
in
his
left
hand
,
which
rested
on
his
hip
;
*NL*
his
right
arm
,
with
a
rugged
propriety
and
force
of
action
,
very
*NL*
earnestly
emphasizing
what
he
said
:
not
least
so
when
it
always
paused
,
a
*NL*
little
bent
,
but
not
withdrawn
,
as
he
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
acquainted
with
all
this
,
you
know
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
except
*NL*
the
last
clause
,
long
ago
.
It
's
a
bad
job
;
that
's
what
it
is
.
You
had
*NL*
better
have
been
satisfied
as
you
were
,
and
not
have
got
married
.
*NL*
However
,
it
's
too
late
to
say
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Was
it
an
unequal
marriage
,
sir
,
in
point
of
years
?
'
asked
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
hear
what
this
lady
asks
.
Was
it
an
unequal
marriage
in
point
of

years

this
unlucky
job
of
yours
?
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
e
`

so

I
were
one-and-twenty
myseln
;
she

twenty
nighbut
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
,
sir
?
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
to
her
Chief
,
with
great
placidity
.
'
I
*NL*
inferred
,
from
its
being
so
miserable
a
marriage
,
that
it
was
probably
an
*NL*
unequal
one
in
point
of
years
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
looked
very
hard
at
the
good
lady
in
a
side-long
way
that
*NL*
had
an
odd
sheepishness
about
it
.
He
fortified
himself
with
a
little
*NL*
more
sherry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
?
Why
do
n't
you
go
on
?
'
he
then
asked
,
turning
rather
irritably
on
*NL*
Stephen
Blackpool
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ha
'
coom
to
ask
yo
,
sir
,
how
I
am
to
be
ridded
o
'
this
woman
.
'
*NL*
Stephen
infused
a
yet
deeper
gravity
into
the
mixed
expression
of
his
*NL*
attentive
face
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
uttered
a
gentle
ejaculation
,
as
having
*NL*
received
a
moral
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
said
Bounderby
,
getting
up
to
lean
his
back
against
*NL*
the
chimney-piece
.
`
What
are
you
talking
about
?
You
took
her
for
better
*NL*
for
worse

*NL*
*NL*

I

be
ridden

so
long

Haply

battering
mad

He

be
free

to
marry
the
female
of
whom
he
speaks
,
I
fear
,
*NL*
sir
,
'
observed
Mrs.
Sparsit
in
an
undertone
,
and
much
dejected
by
the
*NL*
immorality
of
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
.
The
lady
says
what
's
right

I
do

they

be

fro

their

misfortnet

When

Bounderby
,
putting
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
pockets
.
`
There
_
is
_
such
a
law
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
subsiding
into
his
quiet
manner
,
and
never
wandering
in
his
*NL*
attention
,
gave
a
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
's
not
for
you
at
all
.
It
costs
money
.
It
costs
a
mint
of
*NL*
money
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
much
might
that
be
?
'
Stephen
calmly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
'd
have
to
go
to
Doctors
'
Commons
with
a
suit
,
and
you
'd
have
to
*NL*
go
to
a
court
of
Common
Law
with
a
suit
,
and
you
'd
have
to
go
to
the
*NL*
House
of
Lords
with
a
suit
,
and
you
'd
have
to
get
an
Act
of
Parliament
to
*NL*
enable
you
to
marry
again
,
and
it
would
cost
you
-LRB-
if
it
was
a
case
of
*NL*
very
plain
sailing
-RRB-
,
I
suppose
from
a
thousand
to
fifteen
hundred
pound
,
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
Perhaps
twice
the
money
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
no
other
law
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
then
,
sir
,
'
said
Stephen
,
turning
white
,
and
motioning
with
that
*NL*
right
hand
of
his
,
as
if
he
gave
everything
to
the
four
winds
,
''
_
tis
_
a
*NL*
muddle
.
'T
is
just
a
muddle
a
`
toogether
,
an
'
the
sooner
I
am
dead
,
the
*NL*
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Mrs.
Sparsit
again
dejected
by
the
impiety
of
the
people
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pooh
,
pooh
!
Do
n't
you
talk
nonsense
,
my
good
fellow
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
`
about
things
you
do
n't
understand
;
and
do
n't
you
call
the
*NL*
Institutions
of
your
country
a
muddle
,
or
you
'll
get
yourself
into
a
real
*NL*
muddle
one
of
these
fine
mornings
.
The
institutions
of
your
country
are
*NL*
not
your
piece-work
,
and
the
only
thing
you
have
got
to
do
,
is
,
to
mind
*NL*
your
piece-work
.
You
did
n't
take
your
wife
for
fast
and
for
loose
;
but
*NL*
for
better
for
worse
.
If
she
has
turned
out
worse
--
why
,
all
we
have
got
*NL*
to
say
is
,
she
might
have
turned
out
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
Tis
a
muddle
,
'
said
Stephen
,
shaking
his
head
as
he
moved
to
the
door
.
*NL*
''
Tis
a
'
a
muddle
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
!
'
Mr.
Bounderby
resumed
,
as
a
valedictory
*NL*
address
.
`
With
what
I
shall
call
your
unhallowed
opinions
,
you
have
been
*NL*
quite
shocking
this
lady
:
who
,
as
I
have
already
told
you
,
is
a
born
*NL*
lady
,
and
who
,
as
I
have
not
already
told
you
,
has
had
her
own
marriage
*NL*
misfortunes
to
the
tune
of
tens
of
thousands
of
pounds
--
tens
of
Thousands
*NL*
of
Pounds
!
'
-LRB-
he
repeated
it
with
great
relish
-RRB-
.
`
Now
,
you
have
always
*NL*
been
a
steady
Hand
hitherto
;
but
my
opinion
is
,
and
so
I
tell
you
*NL*
plainly
,
that
you
are
turning
into
the
wrong
road
.
You
have
been
*NL*
listening
to
some
mischievous
stranger
or
other
--
they
're
always
about
--
and
*NL*
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
,
to
come
out
of
that
.
Now
you
know
;
'
here
*NL*
his
countenance
expressed
marvellous
acuteness
;
'
I
can
see
as
far
into
a
*NL*
grindstone
as
another
man
;
farther
than
a
good
many
,
perhaps
,
because
I
*NL*
had
my
nose
well
kept
to
it
when
I
was
young
.
I
see
traces
of
the
turtle
*NL*
soup
,
and
venison
,
and
gold
spoon
in
this
.
Yes
,
I
do
!
'
cried
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
shaking
his
head
with
obstinate
cunning
.
`
By
the
Lord
Harry
,
*NL*
I
do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
very
different
shake
of
the
head
and
deep
sigh
,
Stephen
said
,
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
sir
,
I
wish
you
good
day

'
So
he
left
Mr.
Bounderby
swelling
*NL*
at
his
own
portrait
on
the
wall
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
explode
himself
*NL*
into
it
;
and
Mrs.
Sparsit
still
ambling
on
with
her
foot
in
her
stirrup
,
*NL*
looking
quite
cast
down
by
the
popular
vices
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
THE
OLD
WOMAN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
OLD
STEPHEN
descended
the
two
white
steps
,
shutting
the
black
door
with
*NL*
the
brazen
door-plate
,
by
the
aid
of
the
brazen
full-stop
,
to
which
he
*NL*
gave
a
parting
polish
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
,
observing
that
his
hot
*NL*
hand
clouded
it
.
He
crossed
the
street
with
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
thus
was
walking
sorrowfully
away
,
when
he
felt
a
touch
upon
*NL*
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
the
touch
he
needed
most
at
such
a
moment
--
the
touch
that
could
*NL*
calm
the
wild
waters
of
his
soul
,
as
the
uplifted
hand
of
the
sublimest
*NL*
love
and
patience
could
abate
the
raging
of
the
sea
--
yet
it
was
a
woman
's
*NL*
hand
too
.
It
was
an
old
woman
,
tall
and
shapely
still
,
though
withered
*NL*
by
time
,
on
whom
his
eyes
fell
when
he
stopped
and
turned
.
She
was
very
*NL*
cleanly
and
plainly
dressed
,
had
country
mud
upon
her
shoes
,
and
was
*NL*
newly
come
from
a
journey
.
The
flutter
of
her
manner
,
in
the
unwonted
*NL*
noise
of
the
streets
;
the
spare
shawl
,
carried
unfolded
on
her
arm
;
the
*NL*
heavy
umbrella
,
and
little
basket
;
the
loose
long-fingered
gloves
,
to
*NL*
which
her
hands
were
unused
;
all
bespoke
an
old
woman
from
the
country
,
*NL*
in
her
plain
holiday
clothes
,
come
into
Coketown
on
an
expedition
of
rare
*NL*
occurrence
.
Remarking
this
at
a
glance
,
with
the
quick
observation
of
*NL*
his
class
,
Stephen
Blackpool
bent
his
attentive
face
--
his
face
,
which
,
*NL*
like
the
faces
of
many
of
his
order
,
by
dint
of
long
working
with
eyes
*NL*
and
hands
in
the
midst
of
a
prodigious
noise
,
had
acquired
the
*NL*
concentrated
look
with
which
we
are
familiar
in
the
countenances
of
the
*NL*
deaf
--
the
better
to
hear
what
she
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pray
,
sir
,
'
said
the
old
woman
,
`
did
n't
I
see
you
come
out
of
that
*NL*
gentleman
's
house
?
'
pointing
back
to
Mr.
Bounderby
's
.
'
I
believe
it
was
*NL*
you
,
unless
I
have
had
the
bad
luck
to
mistake
the
person
in
following
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
missus
,
'
returned
Stephen
,
`
it
were
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
--
you
'll
excuse
an
old
woman
's
curiosity
--
have
you
seen
the
*NL*
gentleman
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
missus
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
how
did
he
look
,
sir
?
Was
he
portly
,
bold
,
outspoken
,
and
hearty
?
'
*NL*
As
she
straightened
her
own
figure
,
and
held
up
her
head
in
adapting
her
*NL*
action
to
her
words
,
the
idea
crossed
Stephen
that
he
had
seen
this
old
*NL*
woman
before
,
and
had
not
quite
liked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
yes
,
'
he
returned
,
observing
her
more
attentively
,
`
he
were
all
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
healthy
,
'
said
the
old
woman
,
`
as
the
fresh
wind
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
returned
Stephen
.
`
He
were
ett
'n
and
drinking
--
as
large
and
as
*NL*
loud
as
a
Hummobee
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
!
'
said
the
old
woman
,
with
infinite
content
.
`
Thank
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
certainly
never
had
seen
this
old
woman
before
.
Yet
there
was
a
vague
*NL*
remembrance
in
his
mind
,
as
if
he
had
more
than
once
dreamed
of
some
old
*NL*
woman
like
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
along
at
his
side
,
and
,
gently
accommodating
himself
to
her
*NL*
humour
,
he
said
Coketown
was
a
busy
place
,
was
it
not
?
To
which
she
*NL*
answered
`
Eigh
sure
!
Dreadful
busy
!
'
Then
he
said
,
she
came
from
the
*NL*
country
,
he
saw
?
To
which
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
Parliamentary
,
this
morning
.
I
came
forty
mile
by
Parliamentary
this
*NL*
morning
,
and
I
'm
going
back
the
same
forty
mile
this
afternoon
.
I
walked
*NL*
nine
mile
to
the
station
this
morning
,
and
if
I
find
nobody
on
the
road
*NL*
to
give
me
a
lift
,
I
shall
walk
the
nine
mile
back
to-night
.
That
's
*NL*
pretty
well
,
sir
,
at
my
age
!
'
said
the
chatty
old
woman
,
her
eye
*NL*
brightening
with
exultation
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
Deed
't
is
.
Do
n't
do
'
t
too
often
,
missus
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
.
Once
a
year
,
'
she
answered
,
shaking
her
head
.
'
I
spend
my
*NL*
savings
so
,
once
every
year
.
I
come
regular
,
to
tramp
about
the
streets
,
*NL*
and
see
the
gentlemen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
to
see
'em
?
'
returned
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
enough
for
me
,
'
she
replied
,
with
great
earnestness
and
interest
*NL*
of
manner
.
'
I
ask
no
more
!
I
have
been
standing
about
,
on
this
side
of
*NL*
the
way
,
to
see
that
gentleman
,
'
turning
her
head
back
towards
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
's
again
,
`
come
out
.
But
,
he
's
late
this
year
,
and
I
have
not
*NL*
seen
him
.
You
came
out
instead
.
Now
,
if
I
am
obliged
to
go
back
without
*NL*
a
glimpse
of
him
--
I
only
want
a
glimpse
--
well
!
I
have
seen
you
,
and
you
*NL*
have
seen
him
,
and
I
must
make
that
do
.
'
Saying
this
,
she
looked
at
*NL*
Stephen
as
if
to
fix
his
features
in
her
mind
,
and
her
eye
was
not
so
*NL*
bright
as
it
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
large
allowance
for
difference
of
tastes
,
and
with
all
submission
*NL*
to
the
patricians
of
Coketown
,
this
seemed
so
extraordinary
a
source
of
*NL*
interest
to
take
so
much
trouble
about
,
that
it
perplexed
him
.
But
they
*NL*
were
passing
the
church
now
,
and
as
his
eye
caught
the
clock
,
he
*NL*
quickened
his
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
going
to
his
work
?
the
old
woman
said
,
quickening
hers
,
too
,
quite
*NL*
easily
.
Yes
,
time
was
nearly
out
.
On
his
telling
her
where
he
worked
,
*NL*
the
old
woman
became
a
more
singular
old
woman
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
A
n't
you
happy
?
'
she
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
--
there
's
awmost
nobbody
but
has
their
troubles
,
missus
.
'
He
answered
*NL*
evasively
,
because
the
old
woman
appeared
to
take
it
for
granted
that
he
*NL*
would
be
very
happy
indeed
,
and
he
had
not
the
heart
to
disappoint
her
.
*NL*
He
knew
that
there
was
trouble
enough
in
the
world
;
and
if
the
old
woman
*NL*
had
lived
so
long
,
and
could
count
upon
his
having
so
little
,
why
so
much
*NL*
the
better
for
her
,
and
none
the
worse
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
ay
!
You
have
your
troubles
at
home
,
you
mean
?
'
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Times
.
Just
now
and
then
,
'
he
answered
,
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
working
under
such
a
gentleman
,
they
do
n't
follow
you
to
the
*NL*
Factory
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
no
;
they
did
n't
follow
him
there
,
said
Stephen
.
All
correct
there
.
*NL*
Everything
accordant
there
.
-LRB-
He
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
for
her
*NL*
pleasure
,
that
there
was
a
sort
of
Divine
Right
there
;
but
,
I
have
heard
*NL*
claims
almost
as
magnificent
of
late
years
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
now
in
the
black
by-road
near
the
place
,
and
the
Hands
were
*NL*
crowding
in
.
The
bell
was
ringing
,
and
the
Serpent
was
a
Serpent
of
many
*NL*
coils
,
and
the
Elephant
was
getting
ready
.
The
strange
old
woman
was
*NL*
delighted
with
the
very
bell
.
It
was
the
beautifullest
bell
she
had
ever
*NL*
heard
,
she
said
,
and
sounded
grand
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
him
,
when
he
stopped
good-naturedly
to
shake
hands
with
her
*NL*
before
going
in
,
how
long
he
had
worked
there
?
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
dozen
year
,
'
he
told
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
must
kiss
the
hand
,
'
said
she
,
`
that
has
worked
in
this
fine
factory
*NL*
for
a
dozen
year
!
'
And
she
lifted
it
,
though
he
would
have
prevented
*NL*
her
,
and
put
it
to
her
lips
.
What
harmony
,
besides
her
age
and
her
*NL*
simplicity
,
surrounded
her
,
he
did
not
know
,
but
even
in
this
fantastic
*NL*
action
there
was
a
something
neither
out
of
time
nor
place
:
a
something
*NL*
which
it
seemed
as
if
nobody
else
could
have
made
as
serious
,
or
done
*NL*
with
such
a
natural
and
touching
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
at
his
loom
full
half
an
hour
,
thinking
about
this
old
woman
,
*NL*
when
,
having
occasion
to
move
round
the
loom
for
its
adjustment
,
he
*NL*
glanced
through
a
window
which
was
in
his
corner
,
and
saw
her
still
*NL*
looking
up
at
the
pile
of
building
,
lost
in
admiration
.
Heedless
of
the
*NL*
smoke
and
mud
and
wet
,
and
of
her
two
long
journeys
,
she
was
gazing
at
*NL*
it
,
as
if
the
heavy
thrum
that
issued
from
its
many
stories
were
proud
*NL*
music
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
gone
by
and
by
,
and
the
day
went
after
her
,
and
the
lights
sprung
*NL*
up
again
,
and
the
Express
whirled
in
full
sight
of
the
Fairy
Palace
over
*NL*
the
arches
near
:
little
felt
amid
the
jarring
of
the
machinery
,
and
*NL*
scarcely
heard
above
its
crash
and
rattle
.
Long
before
then
his
thoughts
*NL*
had
gone
back
to
the
dreary
room
above
the
little
shop
,
and
to
the
*NL*
shameful
figure
heavy
on
the
bed
,
but
heavier
on
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Machinery
slackened
;
throbbing
feebly
like
a
fainting
pulse
;
stopped
.
*NL*
The
bell
again
;
the
glare
of
light
and
heat
dispelled
;
the
factories
,
*NL*
looming
heavy
in
the
black
wet
night
--
their
tall
chimneys
rising
up
into
*NL*
the
air
like
competing
Towers
of
Babel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spoken
to
Rachael
only
last
night
,
it
was
true
,
and
had
walked
*NL*
with
her
a
little
way
;
but
he
had
his
new
misfortune
on
him
,
in
which
no
*NL*
one
else
could
give
him
a
moment
's
relief
,
and
,
for
the
sake
of
it
,
and
*NL*
because
he
knew
himself
to
want
that
softening
of
his
anger
which
no
*NL*
voice
but
hers
could
effect
,
he
felt
he
might
so
far
disregard
what
she
*NL*
had
said
as
to
wait
for
her
again
.
He
waited
,
but
she
had
eluded
him
.
*NL*
She
was
gone
.
On
no
other
night
in
the
year
could
he
so
ill
have
spared
*NL*
her
patient
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
!
Better
to
have
no
home
in
which
to
lay
his
head
,
than
to
have
a
home
*NL*
and
dread
to
go
to
it
,
through
such
a
cause
.
He
ate
and
drank
,
for
he
*NL*
was
exhausted
--
but
he
little
knew
or
cared
what
;
and
he
wandered
about
in
*NL*
the
chill
rain
,
thinking
and
thinking
,
and
brooding
and
brooding
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
word
of
a
new
marriage
had
ever
passed
between
them
;
but
Rachael
had
*NL*
taken
great
pity
on
him
years
ago
,
and
to
her
alone
he
had
opened
his
*NL*
closed
heart
all
this
time
,
on
the
subject
of
his
miseries
;
and
he
knew
*NL*
very
well
that
if
he
were
free
to
ask
her
,
she
would
take
him
.
He
*NL*
thought
of
the
home
he
might
at
that
moment
have
been
seeking
with
*NL*
pleasure
and
pride
;
of
the
different
man
he
might
have
been
that
night
;
*NL*
of
the
lightness
then
in
his
now
heavy-laden
breast
;
of
the
then
restored
*NL*
honour
,
self-respect
,
and
tranquillity
all
torn
to
pieces
.
He
thought
of
*NL*
the
waste
of
the
best
part
of
his
life
,
of
the
change
it
made
in
his
*NL*
character
for
the
worse
every
day
,
of
the
dreadful
nature
of
his
*NL*
existence
,
bound
hand
and
foot
,
to
a
dead
woman
,
and
tormented
by
a
demon
*NL*
in
her
shape
.
He
thought
of
Rachael
,
how
young
when
they
were
first
*NL*
brought
together
in
these
circumstances
,
how
mature
now
,
how
soon
to
grow
*NL*
old
.
He
thought
of
the
number
of
girls
and
women
she
had
seen
marry
,
how
*NL*
many
homes
with
children
in
them
she
had
seen
grow
up
around
her
,
how
she
*NL*
had
contentedly
pursued
her
own
lone
quiet
path
--
for
him
--
and
how
he
had
*NL*
sometimes
seen
a
shade
of
melancholy
on
her
blessed
face
,
that
smote
him
*NL*
with
remorse
and
despair
.
He
set
the
picture
of
her
up
,
beside
the
*NL*
infamous
image
of
last
night
;
and
thought
,
Could
it
be
,
that
the
whole
*NL*
earthly
course
of
one
so
gentle
,
good
,
and
self-denying
,
was
subjugate
to
*NL*
such
a
wretch
as
that
!
*NL*
*NL*
Filled
with
these
thoughts
--
so
filled
that
he
had
an
unwholesome
sense
of
*NL*
growing
larger
,
of
being
placed
in
some
new
and
diseased
relation
towards
*NL*
the
objects
among
which
he
passed
,
of
seeing
the
iris
round
every
misty
*NL*
light
turn
red
--
he
went
home
for
shelter
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
RACHAEL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
CANDLE
faintly
burned
in
the
window
,
to
which
the
black
ladder
had
*NL*
often
been
raised
for
the
sliding
away
of
all
that
was
most
precious
in
*NL*
this
world
to
a
striving
wife
and
a
brood
of
hungry
babies
;
and
Stephen
*NL*
added
to
his
other
thoughts
the
stern
reflection
,
that
of
all
the
*NL*
casualties
of
this
existence
upon
earth
,
not
one
was
dealt
out
with
so
*NL*
unequal
a
hand
as
Death
.
The
inequality
of
Birth
was
nothing
to
it
.
*NL*
For
,
say
that
the
child
of
a
King
and
the
child
of
a
Weaver
were
born
*NL*
to-night
in
the
same
moment
,
what
was
that
disparity
,
to
the
death
of
any
*NL*
human
creature
who
was
serviceable
to
,
or
beloved
by
,
another
,
while
this
*NL*
abandoned
woman
lived
on
!
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
outside
of
his
home
he
gloomily
passed
to
the
inside
,
with
*NL*
suspended
breath
and
with
a
slow
footstep
.
He
went
up
to
his
door
,
*NL*
opened
it
,
and
so
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quiet
and
peace
were
there
.
Rachael
was
there
,
sitting
by
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
head
,
and
the
light
of
her
face
shone
in
upon
the
midnight
*NL*
of
his
mind
.
She
sat
by
the
bed
,
watching
and
tending
his
wife
.
That
is
*NL*
to
say
,
he
saw
that
some
one
lay
there
,
and
he
knew
too
well
it
must
be
*NL*
she
;
but
Rachael
's
hands
had
put
a
curtain
up
,
so
that
she
was
screened
*NL*
from
his
eyes
.
Her
disgraceful
garments
were
removed
,
and
some
of
*NL*
Rachael
's
were
in
the
room
.
Everything
was
in
its
place
and
order
as
he
*NL*
had
always
kept
it
,
the
little
fire
was
newly
trimmed
,
and
the
hearth
was
*NL*
freshly
swept
.
It
appeared
to
him
that
he
saw
all
this
in
Rachael
's
*NL*
face
,
and
looked
at
nothing
besides
.
While
looking
at
it
,
it
was
shut
*NL*
out
from
his
view
by
the
softened
tears
that
filled
his
eyes
;
but
not
*NL*
before
he
had
seen
how
earnestly
she
looked
at
him
,
and
how
her
own
eyes
*NL*
were
filled
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
again
towards
the
bed
,
and
satisfying
herself
that
all
was
*NL*
quiet
there
,
spoke
in
a
low
,
calm
,
cheerful
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
glad
you
have
come
at
last
,
Stephen
.
You
are
very
late
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ha
'
been
walking
up
an
'
down
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
so
.
But
't
is
too
bad
a
night
for
that
.
The
rain
falls
very
*NL*
heavy
,
and
the
wind
has
risen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
?
True
.
It
was
blowing
hard
.
Hark
to
the
thundering
in
the
*NL*
chimney
,
and
the
surging
noise
!
To
have
been
out
in
such
a
wind
,
and
not
*NL*
to
have
known
it
was
blowing
!
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
been
here
once
before
,
to-day
,
Stephen
.
Landlady
came
round
for
*NL*
me
at
dinner-time
.
There
was
some
one
here
that
needed
looking
to
,
she
*NL*
said
.
And
`
deed
she
was
right
.
All
wandering
and
lost
,
Stephen
.
*NL*
Wounded
too
,
and
bruised
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
slowly
moved
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
,
drooping
his
head
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
came
to
do
what
little
I
could
,
Stephen
;
first
,
for
that
she
worked
*NL*
with
me
when
we
were
girls
both
,
and
for
that
you
courted
her
and
married
*NL*
her
when
I
was
her
friend
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
his
furrowed
forehead
on
his
hand
,
with
a
low
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
next
,
for
that
I
know
your
heart
,
and
am
right
sure
and
certain
that
*NL*
't
is
far
too
merciful
to
let
her
die
,
or
even
so
much
as
suffer
,
for
want
*NL*
of
aid
.
Thou
knowest
who
said
,
``
Let
him
who
is
without
sin
among
you
*NL*
cast
the
first
stone
at
her
!
''
There
have
been
plenty
to
do
that
.
Thou
*NL*
art
not
the
man
to
cast
the
last
stone
,
Stephen
,
when
she
is
brought
so
*NL*
low
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
Rachael
,
Rachael
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thou
hast
been
a
cruel
sufferer
,
Heaven
reward
thee
!
'
she
said
,
in
*NL*
compassionate
accents
.
'
I
am
thy
poor
friend
,
with
all
my
heart
and
*NL*
mind
.

*NL*
The
wounds
of
which
she
had
spoken
,
seemed
to
be
about
the
neck
of
the
*NL*
self-made
outcast
.
She
dressed
them
now
,
still
without
showing
her
.
She
*NL*
steeped
a
piece
of
linen
in
a
basin
,
into
which
she
poured
some
liquid
*NL*
from
a
bottle
,
and
laid
it
with
a
gentle
hand
upon
the
sore
.
The
*NL*
three-legged
table
had
been
drawn
close
to
the
bedside
,
and
on
it
there
*NL*
were
two
bottles
.
This
was
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
so
far
off
,
but
that
Stephen
,
following
her
hands
with
his
*NL*
eyes
,
could
read
what
was
printed
on
it
in
large
letters
.
He
turned
of
a
*NL*
deadly
hue
,
and
a
sudden
horror
seemed
to
fall
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
stay
here
,
Stephen
,

said
Rachael
,
quietly
resuming
her
seat
,
*NL*
'till
the
bells
go
Three

'T
is
to
be
done
again
at
three

may
be
left

But
thy
rest

to-morrow
's
work

*NL*

I
slept
sound
last
night

I
can
wake
many
nights

when
I
am
put
to
it

*NL*
'T
is
thou
who
art
in
need

rest

so
white
and
tired
.
Try
to
sleep
in
*NL*
the
chair
there
,
while
I
watch

Thou
hadst
no
sleep
last
night
,
I
can
*NL*
well
believe

To-morrow
's
work

far
harder
for
thee
than
for
me

*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
thundering
and
surging
out
of
doors
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
*NL*
if
his
late
angry
mood
were
going
about
trying
to
get
at
him
.
She
had
*NL*
cast
it
out
;
she
would
keep
it
out
;
he
trusted
to
her
to
defend
him
from
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
do
n't
know
me
,
Stephen
;
she
just
drowsily
mutters
and
stares
.
I
*NL*
have
spoken
to
her
times
and
again
,
but
she
do
n't
notice
!
'T
is
as
well
*NL*
so

When
she
comes
to
her
right
mind
once
more

I
shall
have
done
what
I
*NL*
can
,
and
she
never
the

*NL*
*NL*
`
How
long

Rachael

is
'

looked
for

that
she
'll
be
so

Doctor
said
she

haply
come

His
eyes
fell
again
on
the
bottle
,
and
a
tremble
passed
over
him
,
causing
*NL*
him
to
shiver
in
every
limb
.
She
thought
he
was
chilled
with
the
wet
.
*NL*
`
No
,
'
he
said
,
`
it
was
not
that
.
He
had
had
a
fright

*NL*

A
fright

'
*NL*

`
Ay

coming
in

When
I
were
walking
.
When
I
were
thinking

When
*NL*
I
--
'
It
seized
him
again
;
and
he
stood
up
,
holding
by
the
mantel-shelf
,
*NL*
as
he
pressed
his
dank
cold
hair
down
with
a
hand
that
shook
as
if
it
*NL*
were
palsied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stephen
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
coming
to
him
,
but
he
stretched
out
his
arm
to
stop
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
Do
n't

do

thee

so

Never

never

'
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
violent
fit
of
trembling
,
and
then
sunk
into
his
chair
.
After
a
*NL*
time
he
controlled
himself
,
and
,
resting
with
an
elbow
on
one
knee
,
and
*NL*
his
head
upon
that
hand
,
could
look
towards
Rachael
.
Seen
across
the
dim
*NL*
candle
with
his
moistened
eyes
,
she
looked
as
if
she
had
a
glory
shining
*NL*
round
her
head
.
He
could
have
believed
she
had
.
He
did
believe
it
,
as
*NL*
the
noise
without
shook
the
window
,
rattled
at
the
door
below
,
and
went
*NL*
about
the
house
clamouring
and
lamenting
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
she
gets
better
,
Stephen
,
't
is
to
be
hoped
she
'll
leave
thee
to

thyself
again
,
and
do
thee
no
more
hurt
.
Anyways
we
will
hope
so
now
.
*NL*
And
now
I
shall
keep
silence
,
for
I
want
thee
to
sleep
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
eyes
,
more
to
please
her
than
to
rest
his
weary
head
;
but
,
*NL*
by
slow
degrees
as
he
listened
to
the
great
noise
of
the
wind
,
he
ceased
*NL*
to
hear
it
,
or
it
changed
into
the
working
of
his
loom
,
or
even
into
the
*NL*
voices
of
the
day
-LRB-
his
own
included
-RRB-
saying
what
had
been
really
said
.
*NL*
Even
this
imperfect
consciousness
faded
away
at
last
,
and
he
dreamed
a
*NL*
long
,
troubled
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
that
he
,
and
some
one
on
whom
his
heart
had
long
been
set
--
but
*NL*
she
was
not
Rachael
,
and
that
surprised
him
,
even
in
the
midst
of
his
*NL*
imaginary
happiness
--
stood
in
the
church
being
married
.
While
the
*NL*
ceremony
was
performing
,
and
while
he
recognized
among
the
witnesses
some
*NL*
whom
he
knew
to
be
living
,
and
many
whom
he
knew
to
be
dead
,
darkness
*NL*
came
on
,
succeeded
by
the
shining
of
a
tremendous
light
.
It
broke
from
*NL*
one
line
in
the
table
of
commandments
at
the
altar
,
and
illuminated
the
*NL*
building
with
the
words
.
They
were
sounded
through
the
church
,
too
,
as
*NL*
if
there
were
voices
in
the
fiery
letters
.
Upon
this
,
the
whole
*NL*
appearance
before
him
and
around
him
changed
,
and
nothing
was
left
as
it
*NL*
had
been
,
but
himself
and
the
clergyman
.
They
stood
in
the
daylight
*NL*
before
a
crowd
so
vast
,
that
if
all
the
people
in
the
world
could
have
*NL*
been
brought
together
into
one
space
,
they
could
not
have
looked
,
he
*NL*
thought
,
more
numerous
;
and
they
all
abhorred
him
,
and
there
was
not
one
*NL*
pitying
or
friendly
eye
among
the
millions
that
were
fastened
on
his
*NL*
face
.
He
stood
on
a
raised
stage
,
under
his
own
loom
;
and
,
looking
up
at
*NL*
the
shape
the
loom
took
,
and
hearing
the
burial
service
distinctly
read
,
*NL*
he
knew
that
he
was
there
to
suffer
death
.
In
an
instant
what
he
stood
*NL*
on
fell
below
him
,
and
he
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Out
of
what
mystery
he
came
back
to
his
usual
life
,
and
to
places
that
*NL*
he
knew
,
he
was
unable
to
consider
;
but
he
was
back
in
those
places
by
*NL*
some
means
,
and
with
this
condemnation
upon
him
,
that
he
was
never
,
in
*NL*
this
world
or
the
next
,
through
all
the
unimaginable
ages
of
eternity
,
to
*NL*
look
on
Rachael
's
face
or
hear
her
voice
.
Wandering
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
unceasingly
,
without
hope
,
and
in
search
of
he
knew
not
what
-LRB-
he
only
*NL*
knew
that
he
was
doomed
to
seek
it
-RRB-
,
he
was
the
subject
of
a
nameless
,
*NL*
horrible
dread
,
a
mortal
fear
of
one
particular
shape
which
everything
*NL*
took
.
Whatsoever
he
looked
at
,
grew
into
that
form
sooner
or
later
.
The
*NL*
object
of
his
miserable
existence
was
to
prevent
its
recognition
by
any
*NL*
one
among
the
various
people
he
encountered
.
Hopeless
labour
!
If
he
led
*NL*
them
out
of
rooms
where
it
was
,
if
he
shut
up
drawers
and
closets
where
*NL*
it
stood
,
if
he
drew
the
curious
from
places
where
he
knew
it
to
be
*NL*
secreted
,
and
got
them
out
into
the
streets
,
the
very
chimneys
of
the
*NL*
mills
assumed
that
shape
,
and
round
them
was
the
printed
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
was
blowing
again
,
the
rain
was
beating
on
the
house-tops
,
and
*NL*
the
larger
spaces
through
which
he
had
strayed
contracted
to
the
four
*NL*
walls
of
his
room
.
Saving
that
the
fire
had
died
out
,
it
was
as
his
eyes
*NL*
had
closed
upon
it
.
Rachael
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
a
doze
,
in
the
*NL*
chair
by
the
bed
.
She
sat
wrapped
in
her
shawl
,
perfectly
still
.
The
*NL*
table
stood
in
the
same
place
,
close
by
the
bedside
,
and
on
it
,
in
its
*NL*
real
proportions
and
appearance
,
was
the
shape
so
often
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
he
saw
the
curtain
move
.
He
looked
again
,
and
he
was
sure
it
*NL*
moved
.
He
saw
a
hand
come
forth
and
grope
about
a
little
.
Then
the
*NL*
curtain
moved
more
perceptibly
,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
put
it
back
,
and
*NL*
sat
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
woful
eyes
,
so
haggard
and
wild
,
so
heavy
and
large
,
she
looked
*NL*
all
round
the
room
,
and
passed
the
corner
where
he
slept
in
his
chair
.
*NL*
Her
eyes
returned
to
that
corner
,
and
she
put
her
hand
over
them
as
a
*NL*
shade
,
while
she
looked
into
it
.
Again
they
went
all
round
the
room
,
*NL*
scarcely
heeding
Rachael
if
at
all
,
and
returned
to
that
corner
.
He
*NL*
thought
,
as
she
once
more
shaded
them
--
not
so
much
looking
at
him
,
as
*NL*
looking
for
him
with
a
brutish
instinct
that
he
was
there
--
that
no
single
*NL*
trace
was
left
in
those
debauched
features
,
or
in
the
mind
that
went
*NL*
along
with
them
,
of
the
woman
he
had
married
eighteen
years
before
.
But
*NL*
that
he
had
seen
her
come
to
this
by
inches
,
he
never
could
have
believed
*NL*
her
to
be
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
,
as
if
a
spell
were
on
him
,
he
was
motionless
and
*NL*
powerless
,
except
to
watch
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stupidly
dozing
,
or
communing
with
her
incapable
self
about
nothing
,
she
*NL*
sat
for
a
little
while
with
her
hands
at
her
ears
,
and
her
head
resting
*NL*
on
them
.
Presently
,
she
resumed
her
staring
round
the
room
.
And
now
,
*NL*
for
the
first
time
,
her
eyes
stopped
at
the
table
with
the
bottles
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Straightway
she
turned
her
eyes
back
to
his
corner
,
with
the
defiance
of
*NL*
last
night
,
and
moving
very
cautiously
and
softly
,
stretched
out
her
*NL*
greedy
hand
.
She
drew
a
mug
into
the
bed
,
and
sat
for
a
while
*NL*
considering
which
of
the
two
bottles
she
should
choose
.
Finally
,
she
*NL*
laid
her
insensate
grasp
upon
the
bottle
that
had
swift
and
certain
death
*NL*
in
it
,
and
,
before
his
eyes
,
pulled
out
the
cork
with
her
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dream
or
reality
,
he
had
no
voice
,
nor
had
he
power
to
stir
.
If
this
be
*NL*
real
,
and
her
allotted
time
be
not
yet
come
,
wake
,
Rachael
,
wake
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
of
that
,
too
.
She
looked
at
Rachael
,
and
very
slowly
,
very
*NL*
cautiously
,
poured
out
the
contents
.
The
draught
was
at
her
lips
.
A
*NL*
moment
and
she
would
be
past
all
help
,
let
the
whole
world
wake
and
come
*NL*
about
her
with
its
utmost
power
.
But
in
that
moment
Rachael
started
up
*NL*
with
a
suppressed
cry
.
The
creature
struggled
,
struck
her
,
seized
her
by
*NL*
the
hair
;
but
Rachael
had
the
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
broke
out
of
his
chair
.
`
Rachael
,
am
I
wakin
'
or
dreamin
'
this
*NL*
dreadfo
'
night
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
Tis
all
well
,
Stephen
.
I
have
been
asleep
,
myself
.
'T
is
near
three
.
*NL*
Hush
!
I
hear
the
bells
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
brought
the
sounds
of
the
church
clock
to
the
window
.
They
*NL*
listened
,
and
it
struck
three
.
Stephen
looked
at
her
,
saw
how
pale
she
*NL*
was
,
noted
the
disorder
of
her
hair
,
and
the
red
marks
of
fingers
on
her
*NL*
forehead
,
and
felt
assured
that
his
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
had
been
*NL*
awake
.
She
held
the
cup
in
her
hand
even
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
it
must
be
near
three
,
'
she
said
,
calmly
pouring
from
the
cup
*NL*
into
the
basin
,
and
steeping
the
linen
as
before
.
'
I
am
thankful
I
*NL*
stayed
!
'T
is
done
now
,
when
I
have
put
this
on
.
There
!
And
now
she
's
*NL*
quiet
again
.
The
few
drops
in
the
basin
I
'll
pour
away
,
for
't
is
bad
*NL*
stuff
to
leave
about
,
though
ever
so
little
of
it
.
'
As
she
spoke
,
she
*NL*
drained
the
basin
into
the
ashes
of
the
fire
,
and
broke
the
bottle
on
the
*NL*
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
nothing
to
do
,
then
,
but
to
cover
herself
with
her
shawl
before
*NL*
going
out
into
the
wind
and
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thou
`
lt
let
me
walk
wi
'
thee
at
this
hour
,
Rachael
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Stephen
.
'T
is
but
a
minute
,
and
I
'm
home
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thou
`
rt
not
fearfo
'
;
'
he
said
it
in
a
low
voice
,
as
they
went
out
at
the
*NL*
door
;
`
to
leave
me
alone
wi
'
her
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
looked
at
him
,
saying
,
`
Stephen
?
'
he
went
down
on
his
knee
before
*NL*
her
,
on
the
poor
mean
stairs
,
and
put
an
end
of
her
shawl
to
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thou
art
an
Angel
.
Bless
thee
,
bless
thee
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
,
as
I
have
told
thee
,
Stephen
,
thy
poor
friend
.
Angels
are
not
*NL*
like
me
.
Between
them
,
and
a
working
woman
fu
'
of
faults
,
there
is
a
*NL*
deep
gulf
set
.
My
little
sister
is
among
them
,
but
she
is
changed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
eyes
for
a
moment
as
she
said
the
words
;
and
then
they
*NL*
fell
again
,
in
all
their
gentleness
and
mildness
,
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thou
changest
me
from
bad
to
good
.
Thou
mak
`
st
me
humbly
wishfo
'
to
be
*NL*
more
like
thee
,
and
fearfo

to
lose
thee
when
this
life
is
ower

and
a

*NL*
the
muddle
cleared
awa

.
Thou

rt
an
Angel
;
it
may
be
,
thou
hast
saved
my
*NL*
soul
alive

'
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
on
his
knee
at
her
feet
,
with
her
shawl
still
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
the
reproof
on
her
lips
died
away
when
she
saw
the
working
of
*NL*
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
coom
home
desp
`
rate
.
I
coom
home
wi'out
a
hope
,
and
mad
wi
'
thinking
*NL*
that
when
I
said
a
word
o
'
complaint
I
was
reckoned
a
unreasonable
Hand
.
*NL*
I
told
thee
I
had
had
a
fright
.
It
were
the
Poison-bottle
on
table
.
I
*NL*
never
hurt
a
livin
'
creetur
;
but
happenin
'
so
suddenly
upon
`
t
,
I
thowt
,
*NL*
``
How
can
_
I
_
say
what
I
might
ha
'
done
to
myseln

or
her
,
or

''
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
two
hands
on
his
mouth
,
with
a
face
of
terror
,
to
stop
him
*NL*
from
saying
more
.
He
caught
them
in
his
unoccupied
hand
,
and
holding
*NL*
them
,
and
still
clasping
the
border
of
her
shawl
,
said
hurriedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
see
thee
,
Rachael
,
setten
by
the
bed
.
I
ha
'
seen
thee
,
aw
this
*NL*
night
.
In
my
troublous
sleep
I
ha
'
known
thee
still
to
be
there
.
*NL*
Evermore
I
will
see
thee
there
.
I
nevermore
will
see
her
or
think
o

*NL*
her
,
but
thou
shalt
be
beside
her
.
I
nevermore
will
see
or
think
o

*NL*
anything
that
angers
me
,
but
thou
,
so
much
better

shalt
be
by

And
so
I
will

and
so
I
will
try

when
thou
and
me
at
last
shall
walk
together
far
*NL*
awa
'
,
beyond
the
deep
gulf
,
in
th
'
country
where
thy
little
sister
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
the
border
of
her
shawl
again
,
and
let
her
go
.
She
bade
him
*NL*
good
night
in
a
broken
voice
,
and
went
out
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
blew
from
the
quarter
where
the
day
would
soon
appear
,
and
still
*NL*
blew
strongly
.
It
had
cleared
the
sky
before
it
,
and
the
rain
had
spent
*NL*
itself
or
travelled
elsewhere
,
and
the
stars
were
bright
.
He
stood
*NL*
bare-headed
in
the
road
,
watching
her
quick
disappearance
.
As
the
*NL*
shining
stars
were
to
the
heavy
candle
in
the
window
,
so
was
Rachael
,
in
*NL*
the
rugged
fancy
of
this
man
,
to
the
common
experiences
of
his
life
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
THE
GREAT
MANUFACTURER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
TIME
went
on
in
Coketown
like
its
own
machinery
:
so
much
material
wrought
*NL*
up
,
so
much
fuel
consumed
,
so
many
powers
worn
out
,
so
much
money
made
.
*NL*
But
,
less
inexorable
than
iron
,
steel
,
and
brass
,
it
brought
its
varying
*NL*
seasons
even
into
that
wilderness
of
smoke
and
brick
,
and
made
the
only
*NL*
stand
that
ever
_
was
_
made
in
the
place
against
its
direful
uniformity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
is
becoming
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
almost
a
young
woman
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Time
,
with
his
innumerable
horse-power
,
worked
away
,
not
minding
what
*NL*
anybody
said
,
and
presently
turned
out
young
Thomas
a
foot
taller
than
*NL*
when
his
father
had
last
taken
particular
notice
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thomas
is
becoming
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
almost
a
young
man
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Time
passed
Thomas
on
in
the
mill
,
while
his
father
was
thinking
about
*NL*
it
,
and
there
he
stood
in
a
long-tailed
coat
and
a
stiff
shirt-collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Really
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
the
period
has
arrived
when
Thomas
ought
*NL*
to
go
to
Bounderby
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Time
,
sticking
to
him
,
passed
him
on
into
Bounderby
's
Bank
,
made
him
an
*NL*
inmate
of
Bounderby
's
house
,
necessitated
the
purchase
of
his
first
*NL*
razor
,
and
exercised
him
diligently
in
his
calculations
relative
to
*NL*
number
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
great
manufacturer
,
always
with
an
immense
variety
of
work
on
*NL*
hand
,
in
every
stage
of
development
,
passed
Sissy
onward
in
his
mill
,
and
*NL*
worked
her
up
into
a
very
pretty
article
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
fear
,
Jupe
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
that
your
continuance
at
the
school
*NL*
any
longer
would
be
useless
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
afraid
it
would
,
sir
,
'
Sissy
answered
with
a
curtsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
not
disguise
from
you
,
Jupe
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
knitting
his
*NL*
brow
,
`
that
the
result
of
your
probation
there
has
disappointed
me
;
has
*NL*
greatly
disappointed
me
.
You
have
not
acquired
,
under
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
M'Choakumchild
,
anything
like
that
amount
of
exact
knowledge
which
I
*NL*
looked
for
.
You
are
extremely
deficient
in
your
facts
.
Your
*NL*
acquaintance
with
figures
is
very
limited
.
You
are
altogether
backward
,
*NL*
and
below
the
mark
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
sorry
,
sir
,
'
she
returned
;
`
but
I
know
it
is
quite
true
.
Yet
I
*NL*
have
tried
hard
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
yes
,
I
believe
you
have
tried
hard
;
I
have
*NL*
observed
you
,
and
I
can
find
no
fault
in
that
respect
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
sir
.
I
have
thought
sometimes
;
'
Sissy
very
timid
here
;
`
that
*NL*
perhaps
I
tried
to
learn
too
much
,
and
that
if
I
had
asked
to
be
allowed
*NL*
to
try
a
little
less
,
I
might
have
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Jupe
,
no
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
shaking
his
head
in
his
profoundest
*NL*
and
most
eminently
practical
way
.
`
No
.
The
course
you
pursued
,
you
*NL*
pursued
according
to
the
system
--
the
system
--
and
there
is
no
more
to
be
*NL*
said
about
it
.
I
can
only
suppose
that
the
circumstances
of
your
early
*NL*
life
were
too
unfavourable
to
the
development
of
your
reasoning
powers
,
*NL*
and
that
we
began
too
late
.
Still
,
as
I
have
said
already
,
I
am
*NL*
disappointed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
I
could
have
made
a
better
acknowledgment
,
sir
,
of
your
kindness
*NL*
to
a
poor
forlorn
girl
who
had
no
claim
upon
you
,
and
of
your
protection
*NL*
of
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
shed
tears
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
Do
n't
shed
tears
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
complain
of
you
.
You
are
an
affectionate
,
earnest
,
good
young
*NL*
woman
--
and
--
and
we
must
make
that
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
sir
,
very
much
,
'
said
Sissy
,
with
a
grateful
curtsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
useful
to
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
and
-LRB-
in
a
generally
pervading
way
-RRB-
you
*NL*
are
serviceable
in
the
family
also
;
so
I
understand
from
Miss
Louisa
,
*NL*
and
,
indeed
,
so
I
have
observed
myself
.
I
therefore
hope
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
,
`
that
you
can
make
yourself
happy
in
those
relations
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
have
nothing
to
wish
,
sir
,
if
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
understand
you
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
;
`
you
still
refer
to
your
father
.
*NL*
I
have
heard
from
Miss
Louisa
that
you
still
preserve
that
bottle
.
Well
!
*NL*
If
your
training
in
the
science
of
arriving
at
exact
results
had
been
*NL*
more
successful
,
you
would
have
been
wiser
on
these
points
.
I
will
say
*NL*
no
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
really
liked
Sissy
too
well
to
have
a
contempt
for
her
;
otherwise
he
*NL*
held
her
calculating
powers
in
such
very
slight
estimation
that
he
must
*NL*
have
fallen
upon
that
conclusion
.
Somehow
or
other
,
he
had
become
*NL*
possessed
by
an
idea
that
there
was
something
in
this
girl
which
could
*NL*
hardly
be
set
forth
in
a
tabular
form
.
Her
capacity
of
definition
might
*NL*
be
easily
stated
at
a
very
low
figure
,
her
mathematical
knowledge
at
*NL*
nothing
;
yet
he
was
not
sure
that
if
he
had
been
required
,
for
example
,
*NL*
to
tick
her
off
into
columns
in
a
parliamentary
return
,
he
would
have
*NL*
quite
known
how
to
divide
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
some
stages
of
his
manufacture
of
the
human
fabric
,
the
processes
of
*NL*
Time
are
very
rapid
.
Young
Thomas
and
Sissy
being
both
at
such
a
stage
*NL*
of
their
working
up
,
these
changes
were
effected
in
a
year
or
two
;
while
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
himself
seemed
stationary
in
his
course
,
and
underwent
no
*NL*
alteration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Except
one
,
which
was
apart
from
his
necessary
progress
through
the
mill
.
*NL*
Time
hustled
him
into
a
little
noisy
and
rather
dirty
machinery
,
in
a
*NL*
by-comer
,
and
made
him
Member
of
Parliament
for
Coketown
:
one
of
the
*NL*
respected
members
for
ounce
weights
and
measures
,
one
of
the
*NL*
representatives
of
the
multiplication
table
,
one
of
the
deaf
honourable
*NL*
gentlemen
,
dumb
honourable
gentlemen
,
blind
honourable
gentlemen
,
lame
*NL*
honourable
gentlemen
,
dead
honourable
gentlemen
,
to
every
other
*NL*
consideration
.
Else
wherefore
live
we
in
a
Christian
land
,
eighteen
*NL*
hundred
and
odd
years
after
our
Master
?
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
,
Louisa
had
been
passing
on
,
so
quiet
and
reserved
,
and
so
*NL*
much
given
to
watching
the
bright
ashes
at
twilight
as
they
fell
into
the
*NL*
grate
,
and
became
extinct
,
that
from
the
period
when
her
father
had
said
*NL*
she
was
almost
a
young
woman
--
which
seemed
but
yesterday
--
she
had
scarcely
*NL*
attracted
his
notice
again
,
when
he
found
her
quite
a
young
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
a
young
woman
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
musing
.
`
Dear
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
discovery
,
he
became
more
thoughtful
than
usual
for
*NL*
several
days
,
and
seemed
much
engrossed
by
one
subject
.
On
a
certain
*NL*
night
,
when
he
was
going
out
,
and
Louisa
came
to
bid
him
good-bye
before
*NL*
his
departure
--
as
he
was
not
to
be
home
until
late
and
she
would
not
see
*NL*
him
again
until
the
morning
--
he
held
her
in
his
arms
,
looking
at
her
in
*NL*
his
kindest
manner
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Louisa
,
you
are
a
woman
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
with
the
old
,
quick
,
searching
look
of
the
night
when
she
*NL*
was
found
at
the
Circus
;
then
cast
down
her
eyes
.
`
Yes
,
father
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
'
I
must
speak
with
you
alone
and
*NL*
seriously
.
Come
to
me
in
my
room
after
breakfast
to-morrow
,
will
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
father
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
hands
are
rather
cold
,
Louisa
.
Are
you
not
well
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
well
,
father
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
cheerful
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
again
,
and
smiled
in
her
peculiar
manner
.
'
I
am
as
*NL*
cheerful
,
father
,
as
I
usually
am
,
or
usually
have
been
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
well
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
So
,
he
kissed
her
and
went
away
;
and
*NL*
Louisa
returned
to
the
serene
apartment
of
the
hair-cutting
character
,
*NL*
and
leaning
her
elbow
on
her
hand
,
looked
again
at
the
short-lived
sparks
*NL*
that
so
soon
subsided
into
ashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
there
,
Loo
?
'
said
her
brother
,
looking
in
at
the
door
.
He
was
*NL*
quite
a
young
gentleman
of
pleasure
now
,
and
not
quite
a
prepossessing
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
Tom
,
'
she
answered
,
rising
and
embracing
him
,
`
how
long
it
is
since
*NL*
you
have
been
to
see
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
have
been
otherwise
engaged
,
Loo
,
in
the
evenings
;
and
in
the
*NL*
daytime
old
Bounderby
has
been
keeping
me
at
it
rather
.
But
I
touch
him
*NL*
up
with
you
when
he
comes
it
too
strong
,
and
so
we
preserve
an
*NL*
understanding
.
I
say
!
Has
father
said
anything
particular
to
you
to-day
*NL*
or
yesterday
,
Loo
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Tom
.
But
he
told
me
to-night
that
he
wished
to
do
so
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
That
's
what
I
mean
,
'
said
Tom
.
`
Do
you
know
where
he
is
*NL*
to-night
?
'
--
with
a
very
deep
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
'll
tell
you
.
He
's
with
old
Bounderby
.
They
are
having
a
regular
*NL*
confab
together
up
at
the
Bank
.
Why
at
the
Bank
,
do
you
think
?
Well
,
*NL*
I
'll
tell
you
again
.
To
keep
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
ears
as
far
off
as
possible
,
*NL*
I
expect
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
hand
upon
her
brother
's
shoulder
,
Louisa
still
stood
looking
at
*NL*
the
fire
.
Her
brother
glanced
at
her
face
with
greater
interest
than
*NL*
usual
,
and
,
encircling
her
waist
with
his
arm
,
drew
her
coaxingly
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
very
fond
of
me
,
a
n't
you
,
Loo
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
I
am
,
Tom
,
though
you
do
let
such
long
intervals
go
by
without
*NL*
coming
to
see
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
sister
of
mine
,
'
said
Tom
,
`
when
you
say
that
,
you
are
near
my
*NL*
thoughts
.
We
might
be
so
much
oftener
together
--
might
n't
we
?
Always
*NL*
together
,
almost
--
might
n't
we
?
It
would
do
me
a
great
deal
of
good
if
you
*NL*
were
to
make
up
your
mind
to
I
know
what
,
Loo
.
It
would
be
a
splendid
*NL*
thing
for
me
.
It
would
be
uncommonly
jolly
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
thoughtfulness
baffled
his
cunning
scrutiny
.
He
could
make
nothing
*NL*
of
her
face
.
He
pressed
her
in
his
arm
,
and
kissed
her
cheek
.
She
*NL*
returned
the
kiss
,
but
still
looked
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
,
Loo
!
I
thought
I
'd
come
,
and
just
hint
to
you
what
was
going
on
:
*NL*
though
I
supposed
you
'd
most
likely
guess
,
even
if
you
did
n't
know
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
stay
,
because
I
'm
engaged
to
some
fellows
to-night
.
You
wo
n't
*NL*
forget
how
fond
you
are
of
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
dear
Tom
,
I
wo
n't
forget
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
a
capital
girl
,
'
said
Tom
.
`
Good-bye
,
Loo
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
an
affectionate
good-night
,
and
went
out
with
him
to
the
*NL*
door
,
whence
the
fires
of
Coketown
could
be
seen
,
making
the
distance
*NL*
lurid
.
She
stood
there
,
looking
steadfastly
towards
them
,
and
listening
*NL*
to
his
departing
steps
.
They
retreated
quickly
,
as
glad
to
get
away
from
*NL*
Stone
Lodge
;
and
she
stood
there
yet
,
when
he
was
gone
and
all
was
quiet
.
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
,
first
in
her
own
fire
within
the
house
,
and
then
in
the
*NL*
fiery
haze
without
,
she
tried
to
discover
what
kind
of
woof
Old
Time
,
*NL*
that
greatest
and
longest-established
Spinner
of
all
,
would
weave
from
*NL*
the
threads
he
had
already
spun
into
a
woman
.
But
his
factory
is
a
*NL*
secret
place
,
his
work
is
noiseless
,
and
his
Hands
are
mutes
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
FATHER
AND
DAUGHTER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ALTHOUGH
Mr.
Gradgrind
did
not
take
after
Blue
Beard
,
his
room
was
quite
*NL*
a
blue
chamber
in
its
abundance
of
blue
books
.
Whatever
they
could
prove
*NL*
-LRB-
which
is
usually
anything
you
like
-RRB-
,
they
proved
there
,
in
an
army
*NL*
constantly
strengthening
by
the
arrival
of
new
recruits
.
In
that
charmed
*NL*
apartment
,
the
most
complicated
social
questions
were
cast
up
,
got
into
*NL*
exact
totals
,
and
finally
settled
--
if
those
concerned
could
only
have
been
*NL*
brought
to
know
it
.
As
if
an
astronomical
observatory
should
be
made
*NL*
without
any
windows
,
and
the
astronomer
within
should
arrange
the
starry
*NL*
universe
solely
by
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
so
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
in
_
his
_
*NL*
Observatory
-LRB-
and
there
are
many
like
it
-RRB-
,
had
no
need
to
cast
an
eye
upon
*NL*
the
teeming
myriads
of
human
beings
around
him
,
but
could
settle
all
*NL*
their
destinies
on
a
slate
,
and
wipe
out
all
their
tears
with
one
dirty
*NL*
little
bit
of
sponge
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Observatory
,
then
:
a
stern
room
,
with
a
deadly
statistical
clock
*NL*
in
it
,
which
measured
every
second
with
a
beat
like
a
rap
upon
a
*NL*
coffin-lid
;
Louisa
repaired
on
the
appointed
morning
.
A
window
looked
*NL*
towards
Coketown
;
and
when
she
sat
down
near
her
father
's
table
,
she
saw
*NL*
the
high
chimneys
and
the
long
tracts
of
smoke
looming
in
the
heavy
*NL*
distance
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Louisa
,
'
said
her
father
,
'
I
prepared
you
last
night
to
give
me
*NL*
your
serious
attention
in
the
conversation
we
are
now
going
to
have
*NL*
together
.
You
have
been
so
well
trained
,
and
you
do
,
I
am
happy
to
say
,
*NL*
so
much
justice
to
the
education
you
have
received
,
that
I
have
perfect
*NL*
confidence
in
your
good
sense
.
You
are
not
impulsive
,
you
are
not
*NL*
romantic
,
you
are
accustomed
to
view
everything
from
the
strong
*NL*
dispassionate
ground
of
reason
and
calculation
.
From
that
ground
alone
,
*NL*
I
know
you
will
view
and
consider
what
I
am
going
to
communicate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
,
as
if
he
would
have
been
glad
that
she
said
something
.
But
*NL*
she
said
never
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
,
my
dear
,
you
are
the
subject
of
a
proposal
of
marriage
that
has
*NL*
been
made
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
waited
,
and
again
she
answered
not
one
word
.
This
so
far
*NL*
surprised
him
,
as
to
induce
him
gently
to
repeat
,
'
a
proposal
of
*NL*
marriage
,
my
dear
.
'
To
which
she
returned
,
without
any
visible
emotion
*NL*
whatever
:
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hear
you
,
father
.
I
am
attending
,
I
assure
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
breaking
into
a
smile
,
after
being
for
the
*NL*
moment
at
a
loss
,
`
you
are
even
more
dispassionate
than
I
expected
,
*NL*
Louisa
.
Or
,
perhaps
,
you
are
not
unprepared
for
the
announcement
I
have
*NL*
it
in
charge
to
make
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
not
say
that
,
father
,
until
I
hear
it
.
Prepared
or
unprepared
,
I
*NL*
wish
to
hear
it
all
from
you
.
I
wish
to
hear
you
state
it
to
me
,
*NL*
father
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
to
relate
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
was
not
so
collected
at
this
moment
as
*NL*
his
daughter
was
.
He
took
a
paper-knife
in
his
hand
,
turned
it
over
,
*NL*
laid
it
down
,
took
it
up
again
,
and
even
then
had
to
look
along
the
blade
*NL*
of
it
,
considering
how
to
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
you
say
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
is
perfectly
reasonable
.
I
have
*NL*
undertaken
then
to
let
you
know
that
--
in
short
,
that
Mr.
Bounderby
has
*NL*
informed
me
that
he
has
long
watched
your
progress
with
particular
*NL*
interest
and
pleasure
,
and
has
long
hoped
that
the
time
might
ultimately
*NL*
arrive
when
he
should
offer
you
his
hand
in
marriage
.
That
time
,
to
*NL*
which
he
has
so
long
,
and
certainly
with
great
constancy
,
looked
forward
,
*NL*
is
now
come
.
Mr.
Bounderby
has
made
his
proposal
of
marriage
to
me
,
and
*NL*
has
entreated
me
to
make
it
known
to
you
,
and
to
express
his
hope
that
*NL*
you
will
take
it
into
your
favourable
consideration
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
between
them
.
The
deadly
statistical
clock
very
hollow
.
The
*NL*
distant
smoke
very
black
and
heavy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
'
said
Louisa
,
`
do
you
think
I
love
Mr.
Bounderby
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
was
extremely
discomfited
by
this
unexpected
question
.
*NL*
`
Well
,
my
child
,
'
he
returned
,
`
I
--
really
--
can
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
'
pursued
Louisa
in
exactly
the
same
voice
as
before
,
`
do
you
ask
*NL*
me
to
love
Mr.
Bounderby
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Louisa
,
no
.
No
.
I
ask
nothing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
'
she
still
pursued
,
`
does
Mr.
Bounderby
ask
me
to
love
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Really
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
it
is
difficult
to
answer
your
*NL*
question
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Difficult
to
answer
it
,
Yes
or
No
,
father
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
my
dear
.
Because
;
'
here
was
something
to
demonstrate
,
and
it
*NL*
set
him
up
again
;
`
because
the
reply
depends
so
materially
,
Louisa
,
on
*NL*
the
sense
in
which
we
use
the
expression
.
Now
,
Mr.
Bounderby
does
not
do
*NL*
you
the
injustice
,
and
does
not
do
himself
the
injustice
,
of
pretending
*NL*
to
anything
fanciful
,
fantastic
,
or
-LRB-
I
am
using
synonymous
terms
-RRB-
*NL*
sentimental
.
Mr.
Bounderby
would
have
seen
you
grow
up
under
his
eyes
,
*NL*
to
very
little
purpose
,
if
he
could
so
far
forget
what
is
due
to
your
*NL*
good
sense
,
not
to
say
to
his
,
as
to
address
you
from
any
such
ground
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
perhaps
the
expression
itself
--
I
merely
suggest
this
to
you
,
my
*NL*
dear
--
may
be
a
little
misplaced
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
would
you
advise
me
to
use
in
its
stead
,
father
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
completely
recovered
by
this
*NL*
time
,
'
I
would
advise
you
-LRB-
since
you
ask
me
-RRB-
to
consider
this
question
,
*NL*
as
you
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
every
other
question
,
simply
as
*NL*
one
of
tangible
Fact
.
The
ignorant
and
the
giddy
may
embarrass
such
*NL*
subjects
with
irrelevant
fancies
,
and
other
absurdities
that
have
no
*NL*
existence
,
properly
viewed
--
really
no
existence
--
but
it
is
no
compliment
to
*NL*
you
to
say
,
that
you
know
better
.
Now
,
what
are
the
Facts
of
this
case
?
*NL*
You
are
,
we
will
say
in
round
numbers
,
twenty
years
of
age
;
Mr.
Bounderby
*NL*
is
,
we
will
say
in
round
numbers
,
fifty
.
There
is
some
disparity
in
your
*NL*
respective
years
,
but
in
your
means
and
positions
there
is
none
;
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
there
is
a
great
suitability
.
Then
the
question
arises
,
Is
*NL*
this
one
disparity
sufficient
to
operate
as
a
bar
to
such
a
marriage
?
In
*NL*
considering
this
question
,
it
is
not
unimportant
to
take
into
account
the
*NL*
statistics
of
marriage
,
so
far
as
they
have
yet
been
obtained
,
in
England
*NL*
and
Wales
.
I
find
,
on
reference
to
the
figures
,
that
a
large
proportion
*NL*
of
these
marriages
are
contracted
between
parties
of
very
unequal
ages
,
*NL*
and
that
the
elder
of
these
contracting
parties
is
,
in
rather
more
than
*NL*
three-fourths
of
these
instances
,
the
bridegroom
.
It
is
remarkable
as
*NL*
showing
the
wide
prevalence
of
this
law
,
that
among
the
natives
of
the
*NL*
British
possessions
in
India
,
also
in
a
considerable
part
of
China
,
and
*NL*
among
the
Calmucks
of
Tartary
,
the
best
means
of
computation
yet
*NL*
furnished
us
by
travellers
,
yield
similar
results
.
The
disparity
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
,
therefore
,
almost
ceases
to
be
disparity
,
and
-LRB-
virtually
-RRB-
all
*NL*
but
disappears
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
recommend
,
father
,
'
asked
Louisa
,
her
reserved
composure
not
*NL*
in
the
least
affected
by
these
gratifying
results
,
`
that
I
should
*NL*
substitute
for
the
term
I
used
just
now
?
For
the
misplaced
expression
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
,
'
returned
her
father
,
`
it
appears
to
me
that
nothing
can
be
*NL*
plainer
.
Confining
yourself
rigidly
to
Fact
,
the
question
of
Fact
you
*NL*
state
to
yourself
is
:
Does
Mr.
Bounderby
ask
me
to
marry
him
?
Yes
,
he
*NL*
does
.
The
sole
remaining
question
then
is
:
Shall
I
marry
him
?
I
think
*NL*
nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Shall
I
marry
him
?
'
repeated
Louisa
,
with
great
deliberation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Precisely
.
And
it
is
satisfactory
to
me
,
as
your
father
,
my
dear
*NL*
Louisa
,
to
know
that
you
do
not
come
to
the
consideration
of
that
*NL*
question
with
the
previous
habits
of
mind
,
and
habits
of
life
,
that
*NL*
belong
to
many
young
women
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
father
,
'
she
returned
,
'
I
do
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
now
leave
you
to
judge
for
yourself
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
'
I
have
*NL*
stated
the
case
,
as
such
cases
are
usually
stated
among
practical
minds
;
*NL*
I
have
stated
it
,
as
the
case
of
your
mother
and
myself
was
stated
in
its
*NL*
time
.
The
rest
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
is
for
you
to
decide
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
beginning
,
she
had
sat
looking
at
him
fixedly
.
As
he
now
leaned
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
,
and
bent
his
deep-set
eyes
upon
her
in
his
turn
,
*NL*
perhaps
he
might
have
seen
one
wavering
moment
in
her
,
when
she
was
*NL*
impelled
to
throw
herself
upon
his
breast
,
and
give
him
the
pent-up
*NL*
confidences
of
her
heart
.
But
,
to
see
it
,
he
must
have
overleaped
at
a
*NL*
bound
the
artificial
barriers
he
had
for
many
years
been
erecting
,
*NL*
between
himself
and
all
those
subtle
essences
of
humanity
which
will
*NL*
elude
the
utmost
cunning
of
algebra
until
the
last
trumpet
ever
to
be
*NL*
sounded
shall
blow
even
algebra
to
wreck
.
The
barriers
were
too
many
and
*NL*
too
high
for
such
a
leap
.
With
his
unbending
,
utilitarian
,
*NL*
matter-of-fact
face
,
he
hardened
her
again
;
and
the
moment
shot
away
into
*NL*
the
plumbless
depths
of
the
past
,
to
mingle
with
all
the
lost
*NL*
opportunities
that
are
drowned
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Removing
her
eyes
from
him
,
she
sat
so
long
looking
silently
towards
the
*NL*
town
,
that
he
said
,
at
length
:
`
Are
you
consulting
the
chimneys
of
the
*NL*
Coketown
works
,
Louisa
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
seems
to
be
nothing
there
but
languid
and
monotonous
smoke
.
Yet
*NL*
when
the
night
comes
,
Fire
bursts
out
,
father
!
'
she
answered
,
turning
*NL*
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
I
know
that
,
Louisa
.
I
do
not
see
the
application
of
the
*NL*
remark
.
'
To
do
him
justice
he
did
not
,
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
it
away
with
a
slight
motion
of
her
hand
,
and
concentrating
*NL*
her
attention
upon
him
again
,
said
,
`
Father
,
I
have
often
thought
that
*NL*
life
is
very
short
.
'
--
This
was
so
distinctly
one
of
his
subjects
that
he
*NL*
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
short
,
no
doubt
,
my
dear
.
Still
,
the
average
duration
of
human
*NL*
life
is
proved
to
have
increased
of
late
years
.
The
calculations
of
*NL*
various
life
assurance
and
annuity
offices
,
among
other
figures
which
*NL*
can
not
go
wrong
,
have
established
the
fact
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
speak
of
my
own
life
,
father
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
indeed
?
Still
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
'
I
need
not
point
out
to
you
,
*NL*
Louisa
,
that
it
is
governed
by
the
laws
which
govern
lives
in
the
*NL*
aggregate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
While
it
lasts
,
I
would
wish
to
do
the
little
I
can
,
and
the
little
I
am
*NL*
fit
for
.
What
does
it
matter
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
seemed
rather
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
last
four
words
;
*NL*
replying
,
`
How
,
matter
?
What
matter
,
my
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bounderby
,
'
she
went
on
in
a
steady
,
straight
way
,
without
regarding
*NL*
this
,
`
asks
me
to
marry
him
.
The
question
I
have
to
ask
myself
is
,
shall
*NL*
I
marry
him
?
That
is
so
,
father
,
is
it
not
?
You
have
told
me
so
,
*NL*
father
.
Have
you
not
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
it
be
so
.
Since
Mr.
Bounderby
likes
to
take
me
thus
,
I
am
satisfied
*NL*
to
accept
his
proposal
.
Tell
him
,
father
,
as
soon
as
you
please
,
that
*NL*
this
was
my
answer
.
Repeat
it
,
word
for
word
,
if
you
can
,
because
I
*NL*
should
wish
him
to
know
what
I
said
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
quite
right
,
my
dear
,
'
retorted
her
father
approvingly
,
`
to
be
*NL*
exact
.
I
will
observe
your
very
proper
request
.
Have
you
any
wish
in
*NL*
reference
to
the
period
of
your
marriage
,
my
child
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
,
father
.
What
does
it
matter
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
had
drawn
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
her
,
and
taken
her
*NL*
hand
.
But
,
her
repetition
of
these
words
seemed
to
strike
with
some
*NL*
little
discord
on
his
ear
.
He
paused
to
look
at
her
,
and
,
still
holding
*NL*
her
hand
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
,
I
have
not
considered
it
essential
to
ask
you
one
question
,
*NL*
because
the
possibility
implied
in
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
too
remote
.
*NL*
But
perhaps
I
ought
to
do
so
.
You
have
never
entertained
in
secret
any
*NL*
other
proposal
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
'
she
returned
,
almost
scornfully
,
`
what
other
proposal
can
have
*NL*
been
made
to
_
me
_
?
Whom
have
I
seen
?
Where
have
I
been
?
What
are
my
*NL*
heart
's
experiences
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Louisa
,
'
returned
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
reassured
and
satisfied
.
`
You
*NL*
correct
me
justly
.
I
merely
wished
to
discharge
my
duty
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
_
I
_
know
,
father
,
'
said
Louisa
in
her
quiet
manner
,
`
of
tastes
*NL*
and
fancies
;
of
aspirations
and
affections
;
of
all
that
part
of
my
nature
*NL*
in
which
such
light
things
might
have
been
nourished
?
What
escape
have
I
*NL*
had
from
problems
that
could
be
demonstrated
,
and
realities
that
could
be
*NL*
grasped
?
'
As
she
said
it
,
she
unconsciously
closed
her
hand
,
as
if
upon
*NL*
a
solid
object
,
and
slowly
opened
it
as
though
she
were
releasing
dust
or
*NL*
ash
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
,
'
assented
her
eminently
practical
parent
,
`
quite
true
,
quite
*NL*
true
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
father
,
'
she
pursued
,
`
what
a
strange
question
to
ask
_
me
_
!
The
*NL*
baby-preference
that
even
I
have
heard
of
as
common
among
children
,
has
*NL*
never
had
its
innocent
resting-place
in
my
breast
.
You
have
been
so
*NL*
careful
of
me
,
that
I
never
had
a
child
's
heart
.
You
have
trained
me
so
*NL*
well
,
that
I
never
dreamed
a
child
's
dream
.
You
have
dealt
so
wisely
*NL*
with
me
,
father
,
from
my
cradle
to
this
hour
,
that
I
never
had
a
child
's
*NL*
belief
or
a
child
's
fear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
was
quite
moved
by
his
success
,
and
by
this
testimony
to
*NL*
it
.
`
My
dear
Louisa
,
'
said
he
,
`
you
abundantly
repay
my
care
.
Kiss
me
,
*NL*
my
dear
girl
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
his
daughter
kissed
him
.
Detaining
her
in
his
embrace
,
he
said
,
'
I
*NL*
may
assure
you
now
,
my
favourite
child
,
that
I
am
made
happy
by
the
sound
*NL*
decision
at
which
you
have
arrived
.
Mr.
Bounderby
is
a
very
remarkable
*NL*
man
;
and
what
little
disparity
can
be
said
to
exist
between
you
--
if
any
--
is
*NL*
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
tone
your
mind
has
acquired
.
It
has
*NL*
always
been
my
object
so
to
educate
you
,
as
that
you
might
,
while
still
*NL*
in
your
early
youth
,
be
-LRB-
if
I
may
so
express
myself
-RRB-
almost
any
age
.
*NL*
Kiss
me
once
more
,
Louisa
.
Now
,
let
us
go
and
find
your
mother
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
they
went
down
to
the
drawing-room
,
where
the
esteemed
lady
*NL*
with
no
nonsense
about
her
,
was
recumbent
as
usual
,
while
Sissy
worked
*NL*
beside
her
.
She
gave
some
feeble
signs
of
returning
animation
when
they
*NL*
entered
,
and
presently
the
faint
transparency
was
presented
in
a
sitting
*NL*
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
'
said
her
husband
,
who
had
waited
for
the
achievement
of
*NL*
this
feat
with
some
impatience
,
`
allow
me
to
present
to
you
Mrs.
*NL*
Bounderby
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
said
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
`
so
you
have
settled
it
!
Well
,
I
'm
sure
I
*NL*
hope
your
health
may
be
good
,
Louisa
;
for
if
your
head
begins
to
split
as
*NL*
soon
as
you
are
married
,
which
was
the
case
with
mine
,
I
can
not
consider
*NL*
that
you
are
to
be
envied
,
though
I
have
no
doubt
you
think
you
are
,
as
*NL*
all
girls
do
.
However
,
I
give
you
joy
,
my
dear
--
and
I
hope
you
may
now
*NL*
turn
all
your
ological
studies
to
good
account
,
I
am
sure
I
do
!
I
must
*NL*
give
you
a
kiss
of
congratulation
,
Louisa
;
but
do
n't
touch
my
right
*NL*
shoulder
,
for
there
's
something
running
down
it
all
day
long
.
And
now
*NL*
you
see
,
'
whimpered
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
adjusting
her
shawls
after
the
*NL*
affectionate
ceremony
,
'
I
shall
be
worrying
myself
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
*NL*
night
,
to
know
what
I
am
to
call
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
'
said
her
husband
,
solemnly
,
`
what
do
you
mean
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whatever
I
am
to
call
him
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
when
he
is
married
to
Louisa
!
*NL*
I
must
call
him
something
.
It
's
impossible
,
'
said
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
with
a
*NL*
mingled
sense
of
politeness
and
injury
,
`
to
be
constantly
addressing
him
*NL*
and
never
giving
him
a
name
.
I
can
not
call
him
Josiah
,
for
the
name
is
*NL*
insupportable
to
me
.
You
yourself
would
n't
hear
of
Joe
,
you
very
well
*NL*
know
.
Am
I
to
call
my
own
son-in-law
,
Mister
!
Not
,
I
believe
,
unless
*NL*
the
time
has
arrived
when
,
as
an
invalid
,
I
am
to
be
trampled
upon
by
my
*NL*
relations
.
Then
,
what
am
I
to
call
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
present
having
any
suggestion
to
offer
in
the
remarkable
*NL*
emergency
,
Mrs.
Gradgrind
departed
this
life
for
the
time
being
,
after
*NL*
delivering
the
following
codicil
to
her
remarks
already
executed
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
to
the
wedding
,
all
I
ask
,
Louisa
,
is
,
--
and
I
ask
it
with
a
fluttering
*NL*
in
my
chest
,
which
actually
extends
to
the
soles
of
my
feet
,
--
that
it
may
*NL*
take
place
soon
.
Otherwise
,
I
know
it
is
one
of
those
subjects
I
shall
*NL*
never
hear
the
last
of
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Gradgrind
had
presented
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
Sissy
had
suddenly
*NL*
turned
her
head
,
and
looked
,
in
wonder
,
in
pity
,
in
sorrow
,
in
doubt
,
in
*NL*
a
multitude
of
emotions
,
towards
Louisa
.
Louisa
had
known
it
,
and
seen
*NL*
it
,
without
looking
at
her
.
From
that
moment
she
was
impassive
,
proud
*NL*
and
cold
--
held
Sissy
at
a
distance
--
changed
to
her
altogether
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
HUSBAND
AND
WIFE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
BOUNDERBY
'S
first
disquietude
on
hearing
of
his
happiness
,
was
*NL*
occasioned
by
the
necessity
of
imparting
it
to
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
He
could
*NL*
not
make
up
his
mind
how
to
do
that
,
or
what
the
consequences
of
the
step
*NL*
might
be
.
Whether
she
would
instantly
depart
,
bag
and
baggage
,
to
Lady
*NL*
Scadgers
,
or
would
positively
refuse
to
budge
from
the
premises
;
whether
*NL*
she
would
be
plaintive
or
abusive
,
tearful
or
tearing
;
whether
she
would
*NL*
break
her
heart
,
or
break
the
looking-glass
;
Mr.
Bounderby
could
not
all
*NL*
foresee
.
However
,
as
it
must
be
done
,
he
had
no
choice
but
to
do
it
;
so
,
*NL*
after
attempting
several
letters
,
and
failing
in
them
all
,
he
resolved
to
*NL*
do
it
by
word
of
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
way
home
,
on
the
evening
he
set
aside
for
this
momentous
purpose
,
*NL*
he
took
the
precaution
of
stepping
into
a
chemist
's
shop
and
buying
a
*NL*
bottle
of
the
very
strongest
smelling-salts
.
`
By
George
!
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
`
if
she
takes
it
in
the
fainting
way
,
I
'll
have
the
skin
off
*NL*
her
nose
,
at
all
events
!
'
But
,
in
spite
of
being
thus
forearmed
,
he
*NL*
entered
his
own
house
with
anything
but
a
courageous
air
;
and
appeared
*NL*
before
the
object
of
his
misgivings
,
like
a
dog
who
was
conscious
of
*NL*
coming
direct
from
the
pantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
evening
,
Mr.
Bounderby
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
evening
,
ma'am
,
good
evening
.
'
He
drew
up
his
chair
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
drew
back
hers
,
as
who
should
say
,
`
Your
fireside
,
sir
.
I
freely
*NL*
admit
it
.
It
is
for
you
to
occupy
it
all
,
if
you
think
proper
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
go
to
the
North
Pole
,
ma'am
!
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
and
returned
,
though
short
of
her
*NL*
former
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
sat
looking
at
her
,
as
,
with
the
points
of
a
stiff
,
sharp
*NL*
pair
of
scissors
,
she
picked
out
holes
for
some
inscrutable
ornamental
*NL*
purpose
,
in
a
piece
of
cambric
.
An
operation
which
,
taken
in
connexion
*NL*
with
the
bushy
eyebrows
and
the
Roman
nose
,
suggested
with
some
*NL*
liveliness
the
idea
of
a
hawk
engaged
upon
the
eyes
of
a
tough
little
*NL*
bird
.
She
was
so
steadfastly
occupied
,
that
many
minutes
elapsed
before
*NL*
she
looked
up
from
her
work
;
when
she
did
so
Mr.
Bounderby
bespoke
her
*NL*
attention
with
a
hitch
of
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
putting
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
pockets
,
and
assuring
himself
with
his
right
hand
that
the
cork
of
the
*NL*
little
bottle
was
ready
for
use
,
'
I
have
no
occasion
to
say
to
you
,
that
*NL*
you
are
not
only
a
lady
born
and
bred
,
but
a
devilish
sensible
woman
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
returned
the
lady
,
`
this
is
indeed
not
the
first
time
that
you
*NL*
have
honoured
me
with
similar
expressions
of
your
good
opinion
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
'
I
am
going
to
astonish
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
?
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
interrogatively
,
and
in
the
most
*NL*
tranquil
manner
possible
.
She
generally
wore
mittens
,
and
she
now
laid
*NL*
down
her
work
,
and
smoothed
those
mittens
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
going
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
to
marry
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
'
I
hope
you
may
be
happy
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
.
Oh
,
indeed
I
hope
you
may
be
happy
,
sir
!
'
And
she
said
it
*NL*
with
such
great
condescension
as
well
as
with
such
great
compassion
for
*NL*
him
,
that
Bounderby
,
--
far
more
disconcerted
than
if
she
had
thrown
her
*NL*
workbox
at
the
mirror
,
or
swooned
on
the
hearthrug
,
--
corked
up
the
*NL*
smelling-salts
tight
in
his
pocket
,
and
thought
,
`
Now
confound
this
*NL*
woman
,
who
could
have
even
guessed
that
she
would
take
it
in
this
way
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
in
a
highly
superior
*NL*
manner
;
somehow
she
seemed
,
in
a
moment
,
to
have
established
a
right
to
*NL*
pity
him
ever
afterwards
;
`
that
you
may
be
in
all
respects
very
happy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
ma'am
,
'
returned
Bounderby
,
with
some
resentment
in
his
tone
:
*NL*
which
was
clearly
lowered
,
though
in
spite
of
himself
,
'
I
am
obliged
to
*NL*
you
.
I
hope
I
shall
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Do
_
you
,
sir
!
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
great
affability
.
`
But
*NL*
naturally
you
do
;
of
course
you
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
awkward
pause
on
Mr.
Bounderby
's
part
,
succeeded
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
*NL*
sedately
resumed
her
work
and
occasionally
gave
a
small
cough
,
which
*NL*
sounded
like
the
cough
of
conscious
strength
and
forbearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
ma'am
,
'
resumed
Bounderby
,
`
under
these
circumstances
,
I
imagine
*NL*
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
a
character
like
yours
to
remain
here
,
*NL*
though
you
would
be
very
welcome
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
dear
no
,
sir
,
I
could
on
no
account
think
of
that
!
'
Mrs.
Sparsit
*NL*
shook
her
head
,
still
in
her
highly
superior
manner
,
and
a
little
changed
*NL*
the
small
cough
--
coughing
now
,
as
if
the
spirit
of
prophecy
rose
within
*NL*
her
,
but
had
better
be
coughed
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
However
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
there
are
apartments
at
the
Bank
,
*NL*
where
a
born
and
bred
lady
,
as
keeper
of
the
place
,
would
be
rather
a
*NL*
catch
than
otherwise
;
and
if
the
same
terms
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
You
were
so
good
as
to
promise
that
you
would
*NL*
always
substitute
the
phrase
,
annual
compliment
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
ma'am
,
annual
compliment
.
If
the
same
annual
compliment
would
be
*NL*
acceptable
there
,
why
,
I
see
nothing
to
part
us
,
unless
you
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
The
proposal
is
like
yourself
,
and
if
the
*NL*
position
I
shall
assume
at
the
Bank
is
one
that
I
could
occupy
without
*NL*
descending
lower
in
the
social
scale
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
of
course
it
is
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
`
If
it
was
not
,
ma'am
,
you
do
n't
*NL*
suppose
that
I
should
offer
it
to
a
lady
who
has
moved
in
the
society
you
*NL*
have
moved
in
.
Not
that
_
I
_
care
for
such
society
,
you
know
!
But
_
you
_
*NL*
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bounderby
,
you
are
very
considerate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
have
your
own
private
apartments
,
and
you
'll
have
your
coals
and
*NL*
your
candles
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
and
you
'll
have
your
maid
to
attend
*NL*
upon
you
,
and
you
'll
have
your
light
porter
to
protect
you
,
and
you
'll
be
*NL*
what
I
take
the
liberty
of
considering
precious
comfortable
,
'
said
*NL*
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
rejoined
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
say
no
more
.
In
yielding
up
my
trust
*NL*
here
,
I
shall
not
be
freed
from
the
necessity
of
eating
the
bread
of
*NL*
dependence
:
'
she
might
have
said
the
sweetbread
,
for
that
delicate
*NL*
article
in
a
savoury
brown
sauce
was
her
favourite
supper
:
`
and
I
would
*NL*
rather
receive
it
from
your
hand
,
than
from
any
other
.
Therefore
,
sir
,
I
*NL*
accept
your
offer
gratefully
,
and
with
many
sincere
acknowledgments
for
*NL*
past
favours
.
And
I
hope
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
concluding
in
an
*NL*
impressively
compassionate
manner
,
'
I
fondly
hope
that
Miss
Gradgrind
may
*NL*
be
all
you
desire
,
and
deserve
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
moved
Mrs.
Sparsit
from
that
position
any
more
.
It
was
in
vain
*NL*
for
Bounderby
to
bluster
or
to
assert
himself
in
any
of
his
explosive
*NL*
ways
;
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
resolved
to
have
compassion
on
him
,
as
a
Victim
.
*NL*
She
was
polite
,
obliging
,
cheerful
,
hopeful
;
but
,
the
more
polite
,
the
*NL*
more
obliging
,
the
more
cheerful
,
the
more
hopeful
,
the
more
exemplary
*NL*
altogether
,
she
;
the
forlorner
Sacrifice
and
Victim
,
he
.
She
had
that
*NL*
tenderness
for
his
melancholy
fate
,
that
his
great
red
countenance
used
*NL*
to
break
out
into
cold
perspirations
when
she
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
marriage
was
appointed
to
be
solemnized
in
eight
weeks
'
*NL*
time
,
and
Mr.
Bounderby
went
every
evening
to
Stone
Lodge
as
an
accepted
*NL*
wooer
.
Love
was
made
on
these
occasions
in
the
form
of
bracelets
;
and
,
*NL*
on
all
occasions
during
the
period
of
betrothal
,
took
a
manufacturing
*NL*
aspect
.
Dresses
were
made
,
jewellery
was
made
,
cakes
and
gloves
were
*NL*
made
,
settlements
were
made
,
and
an
extensive
assortment
of
Facts
did
*NL*
appropriate
honour
to
the
contract
.
The
business
was
all
Fact
,
from
*NL*
first
to
last
.
The
Hours
did
not
go
through
any
of
those
rosy
*NL*
performances
,
which
foolish
poets
have
ascribed
to
them
at
such
times
;
*NL*
neither
did
the
clocks
go
any
faster
,
or
any
slower
,
than
at
other
*NL*
seasons
.
The
deadly
statistical
recorder
in
the
Gradgrind
observatory
*NL*
knocked
every
second
on
the
head
as
it
was
born
,
and
buried
it
with
his
*NL*
accustomed
regularity
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
day
came
,
as
all
other
days
come
to
people
who
will
only
stick
to
*NL*
reason
;
and
when
it
came
,
there
were
married
in
the
church
of
the
florid
*NL*
wooden
legs
--
that
popular
order
of
architecture
--
Josiah
Bounderby
Esquire
*NL*
of
Coketown
,
to
Louisa
eldest
daughter
of
Thomas
Gradgrind
Esquire
of
*NL*
Stone
Lodge
,
M.P.
for
that
borough
.
And
when
they
were
united
in
holy
*NL*
matrimony
,
they
went
home
to
breakfast
at
Stone
Lodge
aforesaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
improving
party
assembled
on
the
auspicious
occasion
,
who
*NL*
knew
what
everything
they
had
to
eat
and
drink
was
made
of
,
and
how
it
*NL*
was
imported
or
exported
,
and
in
what
quantities
,
and
in
what
bottoms
,
*NL*
whether
native
or
foreign
,
and
all
about
it
.
The
bridesmaids
,
down
to
*NL*
little
Jane
Gradgrind
,
were
,
in
an
intellectual
point
of
view
,
fit
*NL*
helpmates
for
the
calculating
boy
;
and
there
was
no
nonsense
about
any
of
*NL*
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
,
the
bridegroom
addressed
them
in
the
following
terms
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
.
Since
you
have
*NL*
done
my
wife
and
myself
the
honour
of
drinking
our
healths
and
happiness
,
*NL*
I
suppose
I
must
acknowledge
the
same
;
though
,
as
you
all
know
me
,
and
*NL*
know
what
I
am
,
and
what
my
extraction
was
,
you
wo
n't
expect
a
speech
*NL*
from
a
man
who
,
when
he
sees
a
Post
,
says
``
that
's
a
Post
,
''
and
when
he
*NL*
sees
a
Pump
,
says
``
that
's
a
Pump
,
''
and
is
not
to
be
got
to
call
a
Post
a
*NL*
Pump
,
or
a
Pump
a
Post
,
or
either
of
them
a
Toothpick
.
If
you
want
a
*NL*
speech
this
morning
,
my
friend
and
father-in-law
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
is
a
*NL*
Member
of
Parliament
,
and
you
know
where
to
get
it
.
I
am
not
your
man
.
*NL*
However
,
if
I
feel
a
little
independent
when
I
look
around
this
table
*NL*
to-day
,
and
reflect
how
little
I
thought
of
marrying
Tom
Gradgrind
's
*NL*
daughter
when
I
was
a
ragged
street-boy
,
who
never
washed
his
face
unless
*NL*
it
was
at
a
pump
,
and
that
not
oftener
than
once
a
fortnight
,
I
hope
I
*NL*
may
be
excused
.
So
,
I
hope
you
like
my
feeling
independent
;
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
,
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
I
_
do
_
feel
independent
.
Now
I
have
mentioned
,
*NL*
and
you
have
mentioned
,
that
I
am
this
day
married
to
Tom
Gradgrind
's
*NL*
daughter
.
I
am
very
glad
to
be
so
.
It
has
long
been
my
wish
to
be
so
.
*NL*
I
have
watched
her
bringing-up
,
and
I
believe
she
is
worthy
of
me
.
At
*NL*
the
same
time
--
not
to
deceive
you
--
I
believe
I
am
worthy
of
her
.
So
,
I
*NL*
thank
you
,
on
both
our
parts
,
for
the
good-will
you
have
shown
towards
*NL*
us
;
and
the
best
wish
I
can
give
the
unmarried
part
of
the
present
*NL*
company
,
is
this
:
I
hope
every
bachelor
may
find
as
good
a
wife
as
I
have
*NL*
found
.
And
I
hope
every
spinster
may
find
as
good
a
husband
as
my
wife
*NL*
has
found
.

*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
after
which
oration
,
as
they
were
going
on
a
nuptial
trip
to
*NL*
Lyons
,
in
order
that
Mr.
Bounderby
might
take
the
opportunity
of
seeing
*NL*
how
the
Hands
got
on
in
those
parts
,
and
whether
they
,
too
,
required
to
*NL*
be
fed
with
gold
spoons
;
the
happy
pair
departed
for
the
railroad
.
The
*NL*
bride
,
in
passing
down-stairs
,
dressed
for
her
journey
,
found
Tom
waiting
*NL*
for
her
--
flushed
,
either
with
his
feelings
,
or
the
vinous
part
of
the
*NL*
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
game
girl
you
are
,
to
be
such
a
first-rate
sister
,
Loo
!
'
*NL*
whispered
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
clung
to
him
as
she
should
have
clung
to
some
far
better
nature
that
*NL*
day
,
and
was
a
little
shaken
in
her
reserved
composure
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Old
Bounderby
's
quite
ready
,
'
said
Tom
.
`
Time
's
up
.
Good-bye
!
I
shall
*NL*
be
on
the
look-out
for
you
,
when
you
come
back
.
I
say
,
my
dear
Loo
!

A
N'T
it
uncommonly
jolly
now

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
EFFECTS
IN
THE
BANK
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
SUNNY
midsummer
day
.
There
was
such
a
thing
sometimes
,
even
in
*NL*
Coketown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seen
from
a
distance
in
such
weather
,
Coketown
lay
shrouded
in
a
haze
of
*NL*
its
own
,
which
appeared
impervious
to
the
sun
's
rays
.
You
only
knew
the
*NL*
town
was
there
,
because
you
knew
there
could
have
been
no
such
sulky
*NL*
blotch
upon
the
prospect
without
a
town
.
A
blur
of
soot
and
smoke
,
now
*NL*
confusedly
tending
this
way
,
now
that
way
,
now
aspiring
to
the
vault
of
*NL*
Heaven
,
now
murkily
creeping
along
the
earth
,
as
the
wind
rose
and
fell
,
*NL*
or
changed
its
quarter
:
a
dense
formless
jumble
,
with
sheets
of
cross
*NL*
light
in
it
,
that
showed
nothing
but
masses
of
darkness
:
--
Coketown
in
the
*NL*
distance
was
suggestive
of
itself
,
though
not
a
brick
of
it
could
be
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wonder
was
,
it
was
there
at
all
.
It
had
been
ruined
so
often
,
that
*NL*
it
was
amazing
how
it
had
borne
so
many
shocks
.
Surely
there
never
was
*NL*
such
fragile
china-ware
as
that
of
which
the
millers
of
Coketown
were
*NL*
made
.
Handle
them
never
so
lightly
,
and
they
fell
to
pieces
with
such
*NL*
ease
that
you
might
suspect
them
of
having
been
flawed
before
.
They
were
*NL*
ruined
,
when
they
were
required
to
send
labouring
children
to
school
;
*NL*
they
were
ruined
when
inspectors
were
appointed
to
look
into
their
works
;
*NL*
they
were
ruined
,
when
such
inspectors
considered
it
doubtful
whether
*NL*
they
were
quite
justified
in
chopping
people
up
with
their
machinery
;
*NL*
they
were
utterly
undone
,
when
it
was
hinted
that
perhaps
they
need
not
*NL*
always
make
quite
so
much
smoke
.
Besides
Mr.
Bounderby
's
gold
spoon
*NL*
which
was
generally
received
in
Coketown
,
another
prevalent
fiction
was
*NL*
very
popular
there
.
It
took
the
form
of
a
threat
.
Whenever
a
Coketowner
*NL*
felt
he
was
ill-used
--
that
is
to
say
,
whenever
he
was
not
left
entirely
*NL*
alone
,
and
it
was
proposed
to
hold
him
accountable
for
the
consequences
*NL*
of
any
of
his
acts
--
he
was
sure
to
come
out
with
the
awful
menace
,
that
he
*NL*
would
`
sooner
pitch
his
property
into
the
Atlantic
.
'
This
had
terrified
*NL*
the
Home
Secretary
within
an
inch
of
his
life
,
on
several
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
Coketowners
were
so
patriotic
after
all
,
that
they
never
had
*NL*
pitched
their
property
into
the
Atlantic
yet
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
*NL*
been
kind
enough
to
take
mighty
good
care
of
it
.
So
there
it
was
,
in
the
*NL*
haze
yonder
;
and
it
increased
and
multiplied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
streets
were
hot
and
dusty
on
the
summer
day
,
and
the
sun
was
so
*NL*
bright
that
it
even
shone
through
the
heavy
vapour
drooping
over
*NL*
Coketown
,
and
could
not
be
looked
at
steadily
.
Stokers
emerged
from
low
*NL*
underground
doorways
into
factory
yards
,
and
sat
on
steps
,
and
posts
,
and
*NL*
palings
,
wiping
their
swarthy
visages
,
and
contemplating
coals
.
The
*NL*
whole
town
seemed
to
be
frying
in
oil
.
There
was
a
stifling
smell
of
hot
*NL*
oil
everywhere
.
The
steam-engines
shone
with
it
,
the
dresses
of
the
*NL*
Hands
were
soiled
with
it
,
the
mills
throughout
their
many
stories
oozed
*NL*
and
trickled
it
.
The
atmosphere
of
those
Fairy
palaces
was
like
the
*NL*
breath
of
the
simoom
:
and
their
inhabitants
,
wasting
with
heat
,
toiled
*NL*
languidly
in
the
desert
.
But
no
temperature
made
the
melancholy
mad
*NL*
elephants
more
mad
or
more
sane
.
Their
wearisome
heads
went
up
and
down
*NL*
at
the
same
rate
,
in
hot
weather
and
cold
,
wet
weather
and
dry
,
fair
*NL*
weather
and
foul
.
The
measured
motion
of
their
shadows
on
the
walls
,
was
*NL*
the
substitute
Coketown
had
to
show
for
the
shadows
of
rustling
woods
;
*NL*
while
,
for
the
summer
hum
of
insects
,
it
could
offer
,
all
the
year
round
,
*NL*
from
the
dawn
of
Monday
to
the
night
of
Saturday
,
the
whirr
of
shafts
and
*NL*
wheels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drowsily
they
whirred
all
through
this
sunny
day
,
making
the
passenger
*NL*
more
sleepy
and
more
hot
as
he
passed
the
humming
walls
of
the
mills
.
*NL*
Sun-blinds
,
and
sprinklings
of
water
,
a
little
cooled
the
main
streets
*NL*
and
the
shops
;
but
the
mills
,
and
the
courts
and
alleys
,
baked
at
a
*NL*
fierce
heat
.
Down
upon
the
river
that
was
black
and
thick
with
dye
,
some
*NL*
Coketown
boys
who
were
at
large
--
a
rare
sight
there
--
rowed
a
crazy
boat
,
*NL*
which
made
a
spumous
track
upon
the
water
as
it
jogged
along
,
while
every
*NL*
dip
of
an
oar
stirred
up
vile
smells
.
But
the
sun
itself
,
however
*NL*
beneficent
,
generally
,
was
less
kind
to
Coketown
than
hard
frost
,
and
*NL*
rarely
looked
intently
into
any
of
its
closer
regions
without
engendering
*NL*
more
death
than
life
.
So
does
the
eye
of
Heaven
itself
become
an
evil
*NL*
eye
,
when
incapable
or
sordid
hands
are
interposed
between
it
and
the
*NL*
things
it
looks
upon
to
bless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
sat
in
her
afternoon
apartment
at
the
Bank
,
on
the
shadier
*NL*
side
of
the
frying
street
.
Office-hours
were
over
:
and
at
that
period
of
*NL*
the
day
,
in
warm
weather
,
she
usually
embellished
with
her
genteel
*NL*
presence
,
a
managerial
board-room
over
the
public
office
.
Her
own
*NL*
private
sitting-room
was
a
story
higher
,
at
the
window
of
which
post
of
*NL*
observation
she
was
ready
,
every
morning
,
to
greet
Mr.
Bounderby
,
as
he
*NL*
came
across
the
road
,
with
the
sympathizing
recognition
appropriate
to
a
*NL*
Victim
.
He
had
been
married
now
a
year
;
and
Mrs.
Sparsit
had
never
*NL*
released
him
from
her
determined
pity
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bank
offered
no
violence
to
the
wholesome
monotony
of
the
town
.
It
*NL*
was
another
red
brick
house
,
with
black
outside
shutters
,
green
inside
*NL*
blinds
,
a
black
street-door
up
two
white
steps
,
a
brazen
door-plate
,
and
*NL*
a
brazen
door-handle
full
stop
.
It
was
a
size
larger
than
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
's
house
,
as
other
houses
were
from
a
size
to
half-a-dozen
sizes
*NL*
smaller
;
in
all
other
particulars
,
it
was
strictly
according
to
pattern
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
conscious
that
by
coming
in
the
evening-tide
among
the
*NL*
desks
and
writing
implements
,
she
shed
a
feminine
,
not
to
say
also
*NL*
aristocratic
,
grace
upon
the
office
.
Seated
,
with
her
needlework
or
*NL*
netting
apparatus
,
at
the
window
,
she
had
a
self-laudatory
sense
of
*NL*
correcting
,
by
her
ladylike
deportment
,
the
rude
business
aspect
of
the
*NL*
place
.
With
this
impression
of
her
interesting
character
upon
her
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
considered
herself
,
in
some
sort
,
the
Bank
Fairy
.
The
*NL*
townspeople
who
,
in
their
passing
and
repassing
,
saw
her
there
,
regarded
*NL*
her
as
the
Bank
Dragon
keeping
watch
over
the
treasures
of
the
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
those
treasures
were
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
knew
as
little
as
they
did
.
Gold
*NL*
and
silver
coin
,
precious
paper
,
secrets
that
if
divulged
would
bring
*NL*
vague
destruction
upon
vague
persons
-LRB-
generally
,
however
,
people
whom
she
*NL*
disliked
-RRB-
,
were
the
chief
items
in
her
ideal
catalogue
thereof
.
For
the
*NL*
rest
,
she
knew
that
after
office-hours
,
she
reigned
supreme
over
all
the
*NL*
office
furniture
,
and
over
a
locked-up
iron
room
with
three
locks
,
*NL*
against
the
door
of
which
strong
chamber
the
light
porter
laid
his
head
*NL*
every
night
,
on
a
truckle
bed
,
that
disappeared
at
cockcrow
.
Further
,
*NL*
she
was
lady
paramount
over
certain
vaults
in
the
basement
,
sharply
*NL*
spiked
off
from
communication
with
the
predatory
world
;
and
over
the
*NL*
relics
of
the
current
day
's
work
,
consisting
of
blots
of
ink
,
worn-out
*NL*
pens
,
fragments
of
wafers
,
and
scraps
of
paper
torn
so
small
,
that
*NL*
nothing
interesting
could
ever
be
deciphered
on
them
when
Mrs.
Sparsit
*NL*
tried
.
Lastly
,
she
was
guardian
over
a
little
armoury
of
cutlasses
and
*NL*
carbines
,
arrayed
in
vengeful
order
above
one
of
the
official
*NL*
chimney-pieces
;
and
over
that
respectable
tradition
never
to
be
separated
*NL*
from
a
place
of
business
claiming
to
be
wealthy
--
a
row
of
*NL*
fire-buckets
--
vessels
calculated
to
be
of
no
physical
utility
on
any
*NL*
occasion
,
but
observed
to
exercise
a
fine
moral
influence
,
almost
equal
*NL*
to
bullion
,
on
most
beholders
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
deaf
serving-woman
and
the
light
porter
completed
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
*NL*
empire
.
The
deaf
serving-woman
was
rumoured
to
be
wealthy
;
and
a
saying
*NL*
had
for
years
gone
about
among
the
lower
orders
of
Coketown
,
that
she
*NL*
would
be
murdered
some
night
when
the
Bank
was
shut
,
for
the
sake
of
her
*NL*
money
.
It
was
generally
considered
,
indeed
,
that
she
had
been
due
some
*NL*
time
,
and
ought
to
have
fallen
long
ago
;
but
she
had
kept
her
life
,
and
*NL*
her
situation
,
with
an
ill-conditioned
tenacity
that
occasioned
much
*NL*
offence
and
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
tea
was
just
set
for
her
on
a
pert
little
table
,
with
its
*NL*
tripod
of
legs
in
an
attitude
,
which
she
insinuated
after
office-hours
,
*NL*
into
the
company
of
the
stern
,
leathern-topped
,
long
board-table
that
*NL*
bestrode
the
middle
of
the
room
.
The
light
porter
placed
the
tea-tray
on
*NL*
it
,
knuckling
his
forehead
as
a
form
of
homage
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
Bitzer
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
_
you
_
,
ma'am
,
'
returned
the
light
porter
.
He
was
a
very
light
*NL*
porter
indeed
;
as
light
as
in
the
days
when
he
blinkingly
defined
a
*NL*
horse
,
for
girl
number
twenty
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
is
shut
up
,
Bitzer
?
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
is
shut
up
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
pouring
out
her
tea
,
`
is
the
news
of
the
*NL*
day
?
Anything
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
ma'am
,
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
have
heard
anything
particular
.
Our
*NL*
people
are
a
bad
lot
,
ma'am
;
but
that
is
no
news
,
unfortunately
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
are
the
restless
wretches
doing
now
?
'
asked
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Merely
going
on
in
the
old
way
,
ma'am
.
Uniting
,
and
leaguing
,
and
*NL*
engaging
to
stand
by
one
another
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
much
to
be
regretted
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
making
her
nose
more
*NL*
Roman
and
her
eyebrows
more
Coriolanian
in
the
strength
of
her
severity
,
*NL*
`
that
the
united
masters
allow
of
any
such
class-combinations
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bitzer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Being
united
themselves
,
they
ought
one
and
all
to
set
their
faces
*NL*
against
employing
any
man
who
is
united
with
any
other
man
,
'
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
have
done
that
,
ma'am
,
'
returned
Bitzer
;
`
but
it
rather
fell
*NL*
through
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
not
pretend
to
understand
these
things
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
*NL*
dignity
,
`
my
lot
having
been
signally
cast
in
a
widely
different
sphere
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Sparsit
,
as
a
Powler
,
being
also
quite
out
of
the
pale
of
any
*NL*
such
dissensions
.
I
only
know
that
these
people
must
be
conquered
,
and
*NL*
that
it
's
high
time
it
was
done
,
once
for
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
ma'am
,
'
returned
Bitzer
,
with
a
demonstration
of
great
respect
for
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
oracular
authority
.
`
You
could
n't
put
it
clearer
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
was
his
usual
hour
for
having
a
little
confidential
chat
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
and
as
he
had
already
caught
her
eye
and
seen
that
she
was
*NL*
going
to
ask
him
something
,
he
made
a
pretence
of
arranging
the
rulers
,
*NL*
inkstands
,
and
so
forth
,
while
that
lady
went
on
with
her
tea
,
glancing
*NL*
through
the
open
window
,
down
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Has
it
been
a
busy
day
,
Bitzer
?
'
asked
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
very
busy
day
,
my
lady
.
About
an
average
day
.
'
He
now
and
then
*NL*
slided
into
my
lady
,
instead
of
ma'am
,
as
an
involuntary
acknowledgment
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
personal
dignity
and
claims
to
reverence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
clerks
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
carefully
brushing
an
imperceptible
*NL*
crumb
of
bread
and
butter
from
her
left-hand
mitten
,
`
are
trustworthy
,
*NL*
punctual
,
and
industrious
,
of
course
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
ma'am
,
pretty
fair
,
ma'am
.
With
the
usual
exception
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
the
respectable
office
of
general
spy
and
informer
in
the
*NL*
establishment
,
for
which
volunteer
service
he
received
a
present
at
*NL*
Christmas
,
over
and
above
his
weekly
wage
.
He
had
grown
into
an
*NL*
extremely
clear-headed
,
cautious
,
prudent
young
man
,
who
was
safe
to
rise
*NL*
in
the
world
.
His
mind
was
so
exactly
regulated
,
that
he
had
no
*NL*
affections
or
passions
.
All
his
proceedings
were
the
result
of
the
*NL*
nicest
and
coldest
calculation
;
and
it
was
not
without
cause
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
habitually
observed
of
him
,
that
he
was
a
young
man
of
the
*NL*
steadiest
principle
she
had
ever
known
.
Having
satisfied
himself
,
on
his
*NL*
father
's
death
,
that
his
mother
had
a
right
of
settlement
in
Coketown
,
*NL*
this
excellent
young
economist
had
asserted
that
right
for
her
with
such
*NL*
a
steadfast
adherence
to
the
principle
of
the
case
,
that
she
had
been
*NL*
shut
up
in
the
workhouse
ever
since
.
It
must
be
admitted
that
he
allowed
*NL*
her
half
a
pound
of
tea
a
year
,
which
was
weak
in
him
:
first
,
because
all
*NL*
gifts
have
an
inevitable
tendency
to
pauperise
the
recipient
,
and
*NL*
secondly
,
because
his
only
reasonable
transaction
in
that
commodity
would
*NL*
have
been
to
buy
it
for
as
little
as
he
could
possibly
give
,
and
sell
it
*NL*
for
as
much
as
he
could
possibly
get
;
it
having
been
clearly
ascertained
*NL*
by
philosophers
that
in
this
is
comprised
the
whole
duty
of
man
--
not
a
*NL*
part
of
man
's
duty
,
but
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pretty
fair
,
ma'am
.
With
the
usual
exception
,
ma'am
,
'
repeated
Bitzer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
--
h
!
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
shaking
her
head
over
her
tea-cup
,
and
taking
*NL*
a
long
gulp
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Thomas
,
ma'am
,
I
doubt
Mr.
Thomas
very
much
,
ma'am
,
I
do
n't
like
his
*NL*
ways
at
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bitzer
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
in
a
very
impressive
manner
,
`
do
you
*NL*
recollect
my
having
said
anything
to
you
respecting
names
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
.
It
's
quite
true
that
you
did
object
to
names
*NL*
being
used
,
and
they
're
always
best
avoided
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Please
to
remember
that
I
have
a
charge
here
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
*NL*
her
air
of
state
.
'
I
hold
a
trust
here
,
Bitzer
,
under
Mr.
Bounderby
.
*NL*
However
improbable
both
Mr.
Bounderby
and
myself
might
have
deemed
it
*NL*
years
ago
,
that
he
would
ever
become
my
patron
,
making
me
an
annual
*NL*
compliment
,
I
can
not
but
regard
him
in
that
light
.
From
Mr.
Bounderby
I
*NL*
have
received
every
acknowledgment
of
my
social
station
,
and
every
*NL*
recognition
of
my
family
descent
,
that
I
could
possibly
expect
.
More
,
*NL*
far
more
.
Therefore
,
to
my
patron
I
will
be
scrupulously
true
.
And
I
do
*NL*
not
consider
,
I
will
not
consider
,
I
can
not
consider
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
*NL*
with
a
most
extensive
stock
on
hand
of
honour
and
morality
,
`
that
I
*NL*
_
should
_
be
scrupulously
true
,
if
I
allowed
names
to
be
mentioned
under
*NL*
this
roof
,
that
are
unfortunately
--
most
unfortunately
--
no
doubt
of
*NL*
that
--
connected
with
his
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Bitzer
knuckled
his
forehead
again
,
and
again
begged
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Bitzer
,
'
continued
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
say
an
individual
,
and
I
will
hear
*NL*
you
;
say
Mr.
Thomas
,
and
you
must
excuse
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
With
the
usual
exception
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bitzer
,
trying
back
,
`
of
an
*NL*
individual
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
--
h
!
'
Mrs.
Sparsit
repeated
the
ejaculation
,
the
shake
of
the
head
*NL*
over
her
tea-cup
,
and
the
long
gulp
,
as
taking
up
the
conversation
again
*NL*
at
the
point
where
it
had
been
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
individual
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bitzer
,
`
has
never
been
what
he
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
,
since
he
first
came
into
the
place
.
He
is
a
dissipated
,
*NL*
extravagant
idler
.
He
is
not
worth
his
salt
,
ma'am
.
He
would
n't
get
it
*NL*
either
,
if
he
had
n't
a
friend
and
relation
at
court
,
ma'am
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
--
h
!
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
another
melancholy
shake
of
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
only
hope
,
ma'am
,
'
pursued
Bitzer
,
`
that
his
friend
and
relation
may
*NL*
not
supply
him
with
the
means
of
carrying
on
.
Otherwise
,
ma'am
,
we
know
*NL*
out
of
whose
pocket
_
that
_
money
comes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
--
h
!
'
sighed
Mrs.
Sparsit
again
,
with
another
melancholy
shake
of
her
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
to
be
pitied
,
ma'am
.
The
last
party
I
have
alluded
to
,
is
to
be
*NL*
pitied

ma'am
,

said
Bitzer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Bitzer
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
'
I
have
always
pitied
the
delusion
,
*NL*
always
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
to
an
individual
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bitzer
,
dropping
his
voice
and
drawing
*NL*
nearer
,
`
he
is
as
improvident
as
any
of
the
people
in
this
town
.
And
you
*NL*
know
what
_
their
_
improvidence
is
,
ma'am
.
No
one
could
wish
to
know
it
*NL*
better
than
a
lady
of
your
eminence
does
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
would
do
well
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
to
take
example
by
you
,
*NL*
Bitzer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
ma'am
.
But
,
since
you
do
refer
to
me
,
now
look
at
me
,
ma'am
.
*NL*
I
have
put
by
a
little
,
ma'am
,
already
.
That
gratuity
which
I
receive
at
*NL*
Christmas
,
ma'am
:
I
never
touch
it
.
I
do
n't
even
go
the
length
of
my
*NL*
wages
,
though
they
're
not
high
,
ma'am
.
Why
ca
n't
they
do
as
I
have
done
,
*NL*
ma'am
?
What
one
person
can
do
,
another
can
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
again
,
was
among
the
fictions
of
Coketown
.
Any
capitalist
there
,
*NL*
who
had
made
sixty
thousand
pounds
out
of
sixpence
,
always
professed
to
*NL*
wonder
why
the
sixty
thousand
nearest
Hands
did
n't
each
make
sixty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
out
of
sixpence
,
and
more
or
less
reproached
them
every
*NL*
one
for
not
accomplishing
the
little
feat
.
What
I
did
you
can
do
.
Why
*NL*
do
n't
you
go
and
do
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
to
their
wanting
recreations
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bitzer
,
`
it
's
stuff
and
*NL*
nonsense
.
_
I
_
do
n't
want
recreations
.
I
never
did
,
and
I
never
shall
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
'em
.
As
to
their
combining
together
;
there
are
many
of
them
,
*NL*
I
have
no
doubt
,
that
by
watching
and
informing
upon
one
another
could
*NL*
earn
a
trifle
now
and
then
,
whether
in
money
or
good
will
,
and
improve
*NL*
their
livelihood
.
Then
,
why
do
n't
they
improve
it
,
ma'am
!
It
's
the
*NL*
first
consideration
of
a
rational
creature
,
and
it
's
what
they
pretend
to
*NL*
want
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pretend
indeed
!
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
sure
we
are
constantly
hearing
,
ma'am
,
till
it
becomes
quite
*NL*
nauseous
,
concerning
their
wives
and
families
,
'
said
Bitzer
.
`
Why
look
*NL*
at
me
,
ma'am
!
I
do
n't
want
a
wife
and
family
.
Why
should
they
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
they
are
improvident
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
ma'am
,
'
returned
Bitzer
,
`
that
's
where
it
is
.
If
they
were
more
*NL*
provident
and
less
perverse
,
ma'am
,
what
would
they
do
?
They
would
say
,
*NL*
``
While
my
hat
covers
my
family

''
or
``
while
my
bonnet
covers
my
*NL*
family

''
--
as
the
case
might
be
,
ma'am
--
``
I

the
person
I
most
like

feed

To
be
sure

assented
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
eating
muffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you

'
said
Bitzer
,
knuckling
his
forehead
again
,
in
return
*NL*
for
the
favour
of
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
improving
conversation
.

Would
you

a

more
hot
water

there
anything

ma'am
.
I
should
n't
wish
to
disturb
you
at
your
meals
,
ma'am
,
*NL*
particularly
tea
,
knowing
your
partiality
for
it
,
'
said
Bitzer
,
craning
a
*NL*
little
to
look
over
into
the
street
from
where
he
stood
;
`
but
there
's
a
*NL*
gentleman
been
looking
up
here
for
a
minute
or
so
,
ma'am
,
and
he
has
come
*NL*
across
as
if
he
was
going
to
knock
.
That
_
is
_
his
knock
,
ma'am
,
no
*NL*
doubt
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
to
the
window
;
and
looking
out
,
and
drawing
in
his
head
again
,
*NL*
confirmed
himself
with
,
`
Yes
,
ma'am
.
Would
you
wish
the
gentleman
to
be
*NL*
shown
in
,
ma'am
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
who
it
can
be
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
wiping
her
mouth
and
*NL*
arranging
her
mittens
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
stranger
,
ma'am
,
evidently
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
stranger
can
want
at
the
Bank
at
this
time
of
the
evening
,
unless
*NL*
he
comes
upon
some
business
for
which
he
is
too
late
,
I
do
n't
know
,
'
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
but
I
hold
a
charge
in
this
establishment
from
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
and
I
will
never
shrink
from
it
.
If
to
see
him
is
any
part
of
*NL*
the
duty
I
have
accepted
,
I
will
see
him
.
Use
your
own
discretion
,
*NL*
Bitzer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
visitor
,
all
unconscious
of
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
magnanimous
words
,
*NL*
repeated
his
knock
so
loudly
that
the
light
porter
hastened
down
to
open
*NL*
the
door
;
while
Mrs.
Sparsit
took
the
precaution
of
concealing
her
little
*NL*
table
,
with
all
its
appliances
upon
it
,
in
a
cupboard
,
and
then
decamped
*NL*
up-stairs
,
that
she
might
appear
,
if
needful
,
with
the
greater
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
please
,
ma'am
,
the
gentleman
would
wish
to
see
you
,
'
said
Bitzer
,
*NL*
with
his
light
eye
at
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
keyhole
.
So
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
who
had
*NL*
improved
the
interval
by
touching
up
her
cap
,
took
her
classical
features
*NL*
down-stairs
again
,
and
entered
the
board-room
in
the
manner
of
a
Roman
*NL*
matron
going
outside
the
city
walls
to
treat
with
an
invading
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
having
strolled
to
the
window
,
and
being
then
engaged
in
*NL*
looking
carelessly
out
,
was
as
unmoved
by
this
impressive
entry
as
man
*NL*
could
possibly
be
.
He
stood
whistling
to
himself
with
all
imaginable
*NL*
coolness
,
with
his
hat
still
on
,
and
a
certain
air
of
exhaustion
upon
*NL*
him
,
in
part
arising
from
excessive
summer
,
and
in
part
from
excessive
*NL*
gentility
.
For
it
was
to
be
seen
with
half
an
eye
that
he
was
a
thorough
*NL*
gentleman
,
made
to
the
model
of
the
time
;
weary
of
everything
,
and
*NL*
putting
no
more
faith
in
anything
than
Lucifer
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
believe
,
sir
,
'
quoth
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
you
wished
to
see
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
,
'
he
said
,
turning
and
removing
his
hat
;
`
pray
excuse
*NL*
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Humph
!
'
thought
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
as
she
made
a
stately
bend
.
`
Five
and
*NL*
thirty
,
good-looking
,
good
figure
,
good
teeth
,
good
voice
,
good
breeding
,
*NL*
well-dressed
,
dark
hair
,
bold
eyes
.
'
All
which
Mrs.
Sparsit
observed
in
*NL*
her
womanly
way
--
like
the
Sultan
who
put
his
head
in
the
pail
of
*NL*
water
--
merely
in
dipping
down
and
coming
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Please
to
be
seated
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
.
Allow
me
.
'
He
placed
a
chair
for
her
,
but
remained
himself
*NL*
carelessly
lounging
against
the
table
.
'
I
left
my
servant
at
the
railway
*NL*
looking
after
the
luggage
--
very
heavy
train
and
vast
quantity
of
it
in
the
*NL*
van
--
and
strolled
on
,
looking
about
me
.
Exceedingly
odd
place
.
Will
you
*NL*
allow
me
to
ask
you
if
it
's
_
always
_
as
black
as
this
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
general
much
blacker
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
in
her
uncompromising
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
possible
!
Excuse
me
:
you
are
not
a
native
,
I
think
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
It
was
once
my
good
or
ill
fortune
,
*NL*
as
it
may
be
--
before
I
became
a
widow
--
to
move
in
a
very
different
sphere
.
*NL*
My
husband
was
a
Powler
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Beg
your
pardon
,
really
!
'
said
the
stranger
.
`
Was
--
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
repeated
,
'
A
Powler
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Powler
Family
,
'
said
the
stranger
,
after
reflecting
a
few
moments
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
signified
assent
.
The
stranger
seemed
a
little
more
fatigued
*NL*
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
be
very
much
bored
here
?
'
was
the
inference
he
drew
from
the
*NL*
communication
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
the
servant
of
circumstances
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
and
I
have
*NL*
long
adapted
myself
to
the
governing
power
of
my
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
philosophical
,
'
returned
the
stranger
,
`
and
very
exemplary
and
*NL*
laudable
,
and
--
'
It
seemed
to
be
scarcely
worth
his
while
to
finish
the
*NL*
sentence
,
so
he
played
with
his
watch-chain
wearily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
May
I
be
permitted
to
ask
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
to
what
I
am
*NL*
indebted
for
the
favour
of
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Assuredly
,
'
said
the
stranger
.
`
Much
obliged
to
you
for
reminding
me
.
*NL*
I
am
the
bearer
of
a
letter
of
introduction
to
Mr.
Bounderby
,
the
banker
.
*NL*
Walking
through
this
extraordinarily
black
town
,
while
they
were
getting
*NL*
dinner
ready
at
the
hotel
,
I
asked
a
fellow
whom
I
met
;
one
of
the
*NL*
working
people
;
who
appeared
to
have
been
taking
a
shower-bath
of
*NL*
something
fluffy
,
which
I
assume
to
be
the
raw
material
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
inclined
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
Raw
material
--
where
Mr.
Bounderby
,
the
banker
,
might
reside
.
Upon
*NL*
which
,
misled
no
doubt
by
the
word
Banker
,
he
directed
me
to
the
Bank
.
*NL*
Fact
being
,
I
presume
,
that
Mr.
Bounderby
the
Banker
does
_
not
_
reside
in
*NL*
the
edifice
in
which
I
have
the
honour
of
offering
this
explanation
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
he
does
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
.
I
had
no
intention
of
delivering
my
letter
at
the
present
*NL*
moment
,
nor
have
I
.
But
strolling
on
to
the
Bank
to
kill
time
,
and
having
*NL*
the
good
fortune
to
observe
at
the
window
,
'
towards
which
he
languidly
*NL*
waved
his
hand
,
then
slightly
bowed
,
'
a
lady
of
a
very
superior
and
*NL*
agreeable
appearance
,
I
considered
that
I
could
not
do
better
than
take
*NL*
the
liberty
of
asking
that
lady
where
Mr.
Bounderby
the
Banker
_
does
_
*NL*
live
.
Which
I
accordingly
venture
,
with
all
suitable
apologies
,
to
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
inattention
and
indolence
of
his
manner
were
sufficiently
relieved
,
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
thinking
,
by
a
certain
gallantry
at
ease
,
which
offered
*NL*
her
homage
too
.
Here
he
was
,
for
instance
,
at
this
moment
,
all
but
*NL*
sitting
on
the
table
,
and
yet
lazily
bending
over
her
,
as
if
he
*NL*
acknowledged
an
attraction
in
her
that
made
her
charming
--
in
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Banks
,
I
know
,
are
always
suspicious
,
and
officially
must
be
,
'
said
the
*NL*
stranger
,
whose
lightness
and
smoothness
of
speech
were
pleasant
*NL*
likewise
;
suggesting
matter
far
more
sensible
and
humorous
than
it
ever
*NL*
contained
--
which
was
perhaps
a
shrewd
device
of
the
founder
of
this
*NL*
numerous
sect
,
whosoever
may
have
been
that
great
man
:
`
therefore
I
may
*NL*
observe
that
my
letter
--
here
it
is
--
is
from
the
member
for
this
*NL*
place
--
Gradgrind
--
whom
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
in
London
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
recognized
the
hand
,
intimated
that
such
confirmation
was
*NL*
quite
unnecessary
,
and
gave
Mr.
Bounderby
's
address
,
with
all
needful
*NL*
clues
and
directions
in
aid
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thousand
thanks
,
'
said
the
stranger
.
`
Of
course
you
know
the
Banker
*NL*
well
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
rejoined
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
In
my
dependent
relation
towards
*NL*
him
,
I
have
known
him
ten
years
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
an
eternity
!
I
think
he
married
Gradgrind
's
daughter
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
suddenly
compressing
her
mouth
,
`
he
had
*NL*
that
--
honour
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
lady
is
quite
a
philosopher
,
I
am
told
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
'
_
Is
_
she
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Excuse
my
impertinent
curiosity
,
'
pursued
the
stranger
,
fluttering
over
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
eyebrows
,
with
a
propitiatory
air
,
`
but
you
know
the
*NL*
family
,
and
know
the
world
.
I
am
about
to
know
the
family
,
and
may
have
*NL*
much
to
do
with
them
.
Is
the
lady
so
very
alarming
?
Her
father
gives
*NL*
her
such
a
portentously
hard-headed
reputation
,
that
I
have
a
burning
*NL*
desire
to
know
.
Is
she
absolutely
unapproachable
?
Repellently
and
*NL*
stunningly
clever
?
I
see
,
by
your
meaning
smile
,
you
think
not
.
You
*NL*
have
poured
balm
into
my
anxious
soul
.
As
to
age
,
now
.
Forty
?
Five
and
*NL*
thirty
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
laughed
outright
.
'
A
chit
,
'
said
she
.
`
Not
twenty
when
she
*NL*
was
married
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
give
you
my
honour
,
Mrs.
Powler
,
'
returned
the
stranger
,
detaching
*NL*
himself
from
the
table
,
`
that
I
never
was
so
astonished
in
my
life
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
really
did
seem
to
impress
him
,
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
capacity
*NL*
of
being
impressed
.
He
looked
at
his
informant
for
full
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
minute
,
and
appeared
to
have
the
surprise
in
his
mind
all
the
time
.
'
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
Mrs.
Powler
,
'
he
then
said
,
much
exhausted
,
`
that
the
*NL*
father
's
manner
prepared
me
for
a
grim
and
stony
maturity
.
I
am
obliged
*NL*
to
you
,
of
all
things
,
for
correcting
so
absurd
a
mistake
.
Pray
excuse
*NL*
my
intrusion
.
Many
thanks
.
Good
day
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
himself
out
;
and
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
hiding
in
the
window
curtain
,
saw
*NL*
him
languishing
down
the
street
on
the
shady
side
of
the
way
,
observed
of
*NL*
all
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
think
of
the
gentleman
,
Bitzer
?
'
she
asked
the
light
porter
,
*NL*
when
he
came
to
take
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Spends
a
deal
of
money
on
his
dress
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
must
be
admitted
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
that
it
's
very
tasteful
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
ma'am
,
'
returned
Bitzer
,
`
if
that
's
worth
the
money
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Besides
which
,
ma'am
,
'
resumed
Bitzer
,
while
he
was
polishing
the
table
,
*NL*
`
he
looks
to
me
as
if
he
gamed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
immoral
to
game
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
ridiculous
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bitzer
,
`
because
the
chances
are
against
*NL*
the
players
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
that
the
heat
prevented
Mrs.
Sparsit
from
working
,
or
*NL*
whether
it
was
that
her
hand
was
out
,
she
did
no
work
that
night
.
She
*NL*
sat
at
the
window
,
when
the
sun
began
to
sink
behind
the
smoke
;
she
sat
*NL*
there
,
when
the
smoke
was
burning
red
,
when
the
colour
faded
from
it
,
*NL*
when
darkness
seemed
to
rise
slowly
out
of
the
ground
,
and
creep
upward
,
*NL*
upward
,
up
to
the
house-tops
,
up
the
church
steeple
,
up
to
the
summits
of
*NL*
the
factory
chimneys
,
up
to
the
sky
.
Without
a
candle
in
the
room
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
sat
at
the
window
,
with
her
hands
before
her
,
not
thinking
much
*NL*
of
the
sounds
of
evening
;
the
whooping
of
boys
,
the
barking
of
dogs
,
the
*NL*
rumbling
of
wheels
,
the
steps
and
voices
of
passengers
,
the
shrill
street
*NL*
cries
,
the
clogs
upon
the
pavement
when
it
was
their
hour
for
going
by
,
*NL*
the
shutting-up
of
shop-shutters
.
Not
until
the
light
porter
announced
*NL*
that
her
nocturnal
sweetbread
was
ready
,
did
Mrs.
Sparsit
arouse
herself
*NL*
from
her
reverie
,
and
convey
her
dense
black
eyebrows
--
by
that
time
*NL*
creased
with
meditation
,
as
if
they
needed
ironing
out-up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
O
,
you
Fool
!
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
when
she
was
alone
at
her
supper
.
Whom
*NL*
she
meant
,
she
did
not
say
;
but
she
could
scarcely
have
meant
the
*NL*
sweetbread
.

CHAPTER

MR.

HARTHOUSE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
Gradgrind
party
wanted
assistance
in
cutting
the
throats
of
the
*NL*
Graces
.
They
went
about
recruiting
;
and
where
could
they
enlist
recruits
*NL*
more
hopefully
,
than
among
the
fine
gentlemen
who
,
having
found
out
*NL*
everything
to
be
worth
nothing
,
were
equally
ready
for
anything
?
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
healthy
spirits
who
had
mounted
to
this
sublime
height
were
*NL*
attractive
to
many
of
the
Gradgrind
school
.
They
liked
fine
gentlemen
;
*NL*
they
pretended
that
they
did
not
,
but
they
did
.
They
became
exhausted
in
*NL*
imitation
of
them
;
and
they
yaw-yawed
in
their
speech
like
them
;
and
they
*NL*
served
out
,
with
an
enervated
air
,
the
little
mouldy
rations
of
political
*NL*
economy
,
on
which
they
regaled
their
disciples
.
There
never
before
was
*NL*
seen
on
earth
such
a
wonderful
hybrid
race
as
was
thus
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
fine
gentlemen
not
regularly
belonging
to
the
Gradgrind
school
,
*NL*
there
was
one
of
a
good
family
and
a
better
appearance
,
with
a
happy
turn
*NL*
of
humour
which
had
told
immensely
with
the
House
of
Commons
on
the
*NL*
occasion
of
his
entertaining
it
with
his
-LRB-
and
the
Board
of
Directors
-RRB-
*NL*
view
of
a
railway
accident
,
in
which
the
most
careful
officers
ever
*NL*
known
,
employed
by
the
most
liberal
managers
ever
heard
of
,
assisted
by
*NL*
the
finest
mechanical
contrivances
ever
devised
,
the
whole
in
action
on
*NL*
the
best
line
ever
constructed
,
had
killed
five
people
and
wounded
*NL*
thirty-two
,
by
a
casualty
without
which
the
excellence
of
the
whole
*NL*
system
would
have
been
positively
incomplete
.
Among
the
slain
was
a
cow
,
*NL*
and
among
the
scattered
articles
unowned
,
a
widow
's
cap
.
And
the
*NL*
honourable
member
had
so
tickled
the
House
-LRB-
which
has
a
delicate
sense
of
*NL*
humour
-RRB-
by
putting
the
cap
on
the
cow
,
that
it
became
impatient
of
any
*NL*
serious
reference
to
the
Coroner
's
Inquest
,
and
brought
the
railway
off
*NL*
with
Cheers
and
Laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
this
gentleman
had
a
younger
brother
of
still
better
appearance
than
*NL*
himself
,
who
had
tried
life
as
a
Cornet
of
Dragoons
,
and
found
it
a
bore
;
*NL*
and
had
afterwards
tried
it
in
the
train
of
an
English
minister
abroad
,
*NL*
and
found
it
a
bore
;
and
had
then
strolled
to
Jerusalem
,
and
got
bored
*NL*
there
;
and
had
then
gone
yachting
about
the
world
,
and
got
bored
*NL*
everywhere
.
To
whom
this
honourable
and
jocular
,
member
fraternally
said
*NL*
one
day
,
`
Jem
,
there
's
a
good
opening
among
the
hard
Fact
fellows
,
and
*NL*
they
want
men
.
I
wonder
you
do
n't
go
in
for
statistics
.
'
Jem
,
rather
*NL*
taken
by
the
novelty
of
the
idea
,
and
very
hard
up
for
a
change
,
was
as
*NL*
ready
to
`
go
in
'
for
statistics
as
for
anything
else
.
So
,
he
went
in
.
*NL*
He
coached
himself
up
with
a
blue-book
or
two
;
and
his
brother
put
it
*NL*
about
among
the
hard
Fact
fellows
,
and
said
,
`
If
you
want
to
bring
in
,
*NL*
for
any
place
,
a
handsome
dog
who
can
make
you
a
devilish
good
speech
,
*NL*
look
after
my
brother
Jem
,
for
he
's
your
man
.
'
After
a
few
dashes
in
the
*NL*
public
meeting
way
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
and
a
council
of
political
sages
*NL*
approved
of
Jem
,
and
it
was
resolved
to
send
him
down
to
Coketown
,
to
*NL*
become
known
there
and
in
the
neighbourhood
.
Hence
the
letter
Jem
had
*NL*
last
night
shown
to
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
which
Mr.
Bounderby
now
held
in
his
*NL*
hand
;
superscribed
,
`
Josiah
Bounderby
,
Esquire
,
Banker
,
Coketown
.
*NL*
Specially
to
introduce
James
Harthouse
,
Esquire
.
Thomas
Gradgrind
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Within
an
hour
of
the
receipt
of
this
dispatch
and
Mr.
James
Harthouse
's
*NL*
card
,
Mr.
Bounderby
put
on
his
hat
and
went
down
to
the
Hotel
.
There
he
*NL*
found
Mr.
James
Harthouse
looking
out
of
window
,
in
a
state
of
mind
so
*NL*
disconsolate
,
that
he
was
already
half-disposed
to
`
go
in
'
for
something
*NL*
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
name
,
sir
,
'
said
his
visitor
,
`
is
Josiah
Bounderby
,
of
Coketown
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
James
Harthouse
was
very
happy
indeed
-LRB-
though
he
scarcely
looked
so
-RRB-
*NL*
to
have
a
pleasure
he
had
long
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Coketown
,
sir
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
obstinately
taking
a
chair
,
`
is
not
the
*NL*
kind
of
place
you
have
been
accustomed
to
.
Therefore
,
if
you
will
allow
*NL*
me
--
or
whether
you
will
or
not
,
for
I
am
a
plain
man
--
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
something
about
it
before
we
go
any
further
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Harthouse
would
be
charmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
be
too
sure
of
that
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
'
I
do
n't
promise
it
.
First
*NL*
of
all
,
you
see
our
smoke
.
That
's
meat
and
drink
to
us
.
It
's
the
*NL*
healthiest
thing
in
the
world
in
all
respects
,
and
particularly
for
the
*NL*
lungs
.
If
you
are
one
of
those
who
want
us
to
consume
it
,
I
differ
from
*NL*
you
.
We
are
not
going
to
wear
the
bottoms
of
our
boilers
out
any
faster
*NL*
than
we
wear
'em
out
now
,
for
all
the
humbugging
sentiment
in
Great
*NL*
Britain
and
Ireland
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
By
way
of
`
going
in
'
to
the
fullest
extent
,
Mr.
Harthouse
rejoined
,
`
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
I
assure
you
I
am
entirely
and
completely
of
your
way
of
*NL*
thinking
.
On
conviction
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
`
Now
,
you
have
heard
a
lot
of
*NL*
talk
about
the
work
in
our
mills
,
no
doubt
.
You
have
?
Very
good
.
I
'll
*NL*
state
the
fact
of
it
to
you
.
It
's
the
pleasantest
work
there
is
,
and
*NL*
it
's
the
lightest
work
there
is
,
and
it
's
the
best-paid
work
there
is
.
*NL*
More
than
that
,
we
could
n't
improve
the
mills
themselves
,
unless
we
laid
*NL*
down
Turkey
carpets
on
the
floors
.
Which
we
're
not
a-going
to
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bounderby
,
perfectly
right
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lastly
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
as
to
our
Hands
.
There
's
not
a
Hand
in
this
*NL*
town
,
sir
,
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
but
has
one
ultimate
object
in
life
.
*NL*
That
object
is
,
to
be
fed
on
turtle
soup
and
venison
with
a
gold
spoon
.
*NL*
Now
,
they
're
not
a-going
--
none
of
'em
--
ever
to
be
fed
on
turtle
soup
and
*NL*
venison
with
a
gold
spoon
.
And
now
you
know
the
place
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Harthouse
professed
himself
in
the
highest
degree
instructed
and
*NL*
refreshed
,
by
this
condensed
epitome
of
the
whole
Coketown
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
you
see
,
'
replied
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
it
suits
my
disposition
to
have
a
*NL*
full
understanding
with
a
man
,
particularly
with
a
public
man
,
when
I
*NL*
make
his
acquaintance
.
I
have
only
one
thing
more
to
say
to
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Harthouse
,
before
assuring
you
of
the
pleasure
with
which
I
shall
*NL*
respond
,
to
the
utmost
of
my
poor
ability
,
to
my
friend
Tom
Gradgrind
's
*NL*
letter
of
introduction
.
You
are
a
man
of
family
.
Do
n't
you
deceive
*NL*
yourself
by
supposing
for
a
moment
that
I
am
a
man
of
family
.
I
am
a
bit
*NL*
of
dirty
riff-raff
,
and
a
genuine
scrap
of
tag
,
rag
,
and
bobtail
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
If
anything
could
have
exalted
Jem
's
interest
in
Mr.
Bounderby
,
it
would
*NL*
have
been
this
very
circumstance
.
Or
,
so
he
told
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
now
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
we
may
shake
hands
on
equal
terms
.
I
say
,
*NL*
equal
terms
,
because
although
I
know
what
I
am
,
and
the
exact
depth
of
*NL*
the
gutter
I
have
lifted
myself
out
of
,
better
than
any
man
does
,
I
am
as
*NL*
proud
as
you
are
.
I
am
just
as
proud
as
you
are
.
Having
now
asserted
my
*NL*
independence
in
a
proper
manner
,
I
may
come
to
how
do
you
find
yourself
,
*NL*
and
I
hope
you
're
pretty
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
better
,
Mr.
Harthouse
gave
him
to
understand
as
they
shook
hands
,
for
*NL*
the
salubrious
air
of
Coketown
.
Mr.
Bounderby
received
the
answer
with
*NL*
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
you
know
,
'
said
he
,
`
or
perhaps
you
do
n't
know
,
I
married
Tom
*NL*
Gradgrind
's
daughter
.
If
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
walk
up
*NL*
town
with
me
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
introduce
you
to
Tom
Gradgrind
's
*NL*
daughter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bounderby
,
'
said
Jem
,
`
you
anticipate
my
dearest
wishes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
without
further
discourse
;
and
Mr.
Bounderby
piloted
the
*NL*
new
acquaintance
who
so
strongly
contrasted
with
him
,
to
the
private
red
*NL*
brick
dwelling
,
with
the
black
outside
shutters
,
the
green
inside
blinds
,
*NL*
and
the
black
street
door
up
the
two
white
steps
.
In
the
drawing-room
of
*NL*
which
mansion
,
there
presently
entered
to
them
the
most
remarkable
girl
*NL*
Mr.
James
Harthouse
had
ever
seen
.
She
was
so
constrained
,
and
yet
so
*NL*
careless
;
so
reserved
,
and
yet
so
watchful
;
so
cold
and
proud
,
and
yet
so
*NL*
sensitively
ashamed
of
her
husband
's
braggart
humility
--
from
which
she
*NL*
shrunk
as
if
every
example
of
it
were
a
cut
or
a
blow
;
that
it
was
quite
*NL*
a
new
sensation
to
observe
her
.
In
face
she
was
no
less
remarkable
than
*NL*
in
manner
.
Her
features
were
handsome
;
but
their
natural
play
was
so
*NL*
locked
up
,
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
guess
at
their
genuine
*NL*
expression
.
Utterly
indifferent
,
perfectly
self-reliant
,
never
at
a
*NL*
loss
,
and
yet
never
at
her
ease
,
with
her
figure
in
company
with
them
*NL*
there
,
and
her
mind
apparently
quite
alone
--
it
was
of
no
use
`
going
in
'
*NL*
yet
awhile
to
comprehend
this
girl
,
for
she
baffled
all
penetration
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
the
visitor
glanced
to
the
house
itself
.
*NL*
There
was
no
mute
sign
of
a
woman
in
the
room
.
No
graceful
little
*NL*
adornment
,
no
fanciful
little
device
,
however
trivial
,
anywhere
expressed
*NL*
her
influence
.
Cheerless
and
comfortless
,
boastfully
and
doggedly
rich
,
*NL*
there
the
room
stared
at
its
present
occupants
,
unsoftened
and
unrelieved
*NL*
by
the
least
trace
of
any
womanly
occupation
.
As
Mr.
Bounderby
stood
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
his
household
gods
,
so
those
unrelenting
divinities
occupied
*NL*
their
places
around
Mr.
Bounderby
,
and
they
were
worthy
of
one
another
,
*NL*
and
well
matched
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
,
sir
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
is
my
wife
,
Mrs.
Bounderby
:
Tom
Gradgrind
's
*NL*
eldest
daughter
.
Loo
,
Mr.
James
Harthouse
.
Mr.
Harthouse
has
joined
*NL*
your
father
's
muster-roll
.
If
he
is
not
Tom
Gradgrind
's
colleague
before
*NL*
long
,
I
believe
we
shall
at
least
hear
of
him
in
connexion
with
one
of
*NL*
our
neighbouring
towns
.
You
observe
,
Mr.
Harthouse
,
that
my
wife
is
my
*NL*
junior
.
I
do
n't
know
what
she
saw
in
me
to
marry
me
,
but
she
saw
*NL*
something
in
me
,
I
suppose
,
or
she
would
n't
have
married
me
.
She
has
*NL*
lots
of
expensive
knowledge
,
sir
,
political
and
otherwise
.
If
you
want
*NL*
to
cram
for
anything
,
I
should
be
troubled
to
recommend
you
to
a
better
*NL*
adviser
than
Loo
Bounderby
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
To
a
more
agreeable
adviser
,
or
one
from
whom
he
would
be
more
likely
to
*NL*
learn
,
Mr.
Harthouse
could
never
be
recommended
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
!
'
said
his
host
.
`
If
you
're
in
the
complimentary
line
,
you
'll
get
*NL*
on
here
,
for
you
'll
meet
with
no
competition
.
I
have
never
been
in
the
*NL*
way
of
learning
compliments
myself
,
and
I
do
n't
profess
to
understand
the
*NL*
art
of
paying
'em
.
In
fact
,
despise
'em
.
But
,
your
bringing-up
was
*NL*
different
from
mine
;
mine
was
a
real
thing
,
by
George
!
You
're
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
one
.
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
of
*NL*
Coketown
,
and
that
's
enough
for
me
.
However
,
though
I
am
not
influenced
*NL*
by
manners
and
station
,
Loo
Bounderby
may
be
.
She
had
n't
my
*NL*
advantages
--
disadvantages
you
would
call
'em
,
but
I
call
'em
advantages
--
so
*NL*
you
'll
not
waste
your
power
,
I
dare
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bounderby
,
'
said
Jem
,
turning
with
a
smile
to
Louisa
,
`
is
a
noble
*NL*
animal
in
a
comparatively
natural
state
,
quite
free
from
the
harness
in
*NL*
which
a
conventional
hack
like
myself
works
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
respect
Mr.
Bounderby
very
much
,
'
she
quietly
returned
.
`
It
is
*NL*
natural
that
you
should
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
disgracefully
thrown
out
,
for
a
gentleman
who
had
seen
so
much
of
*NL*
the
world
,
and
thought
,
`
Now
,
how
am
I
to
take
this
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
going
to
devote
yourself
,
as
I
gather
from
what
Mr.
Bounderby
*NL*
has
said
,
to
the
service
of
your
country
.
You
have
made
up
your
mind
,
'
*NL*
said
Louisa
,
still
standing
before
him
where
she
had
first
stopped
--
in
all
*NL*
the
singular
contrariety
of
her
self-possession
,
and
her
being
obviously
*NL*
very
ill
at
ease
--
`
to
show
the
nation
the
way
out
of
all
its
*NL*
difficulties
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
'
he
returned
,
laughing
,
`
upon
my
honour
,
no
.
I
will
*NL*
make
no
such
pretence
to
you
.
I
have
seen
a
little
,
here
and
there
,
up
*NL*
and
down
;
I
have
found
it
all
to
be
very
worthless
,
as
everybody
has
,
and
*NL*
as
some
confess
they
have
,
and
some
do
not
;
and
I
am
going
in
for
your
*NL*
respected
father
's
opinions
--
really
because
I
have
no
choice
of
opinions
,
*NL*
and
may
as
well
back
them
as
anything
else
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
none
of
your
own
?
'
asked
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
not
so
much
as
the
slightest
predilection
left
.
I
assure
you
I
*NL*
attach
not
the
least
importance
to
any
opinions
.
The
result
of
the
*NL*
varieties
of
boredom
I
have
undergone
,
is
a
conviction
-LRB-
unless
conviction
*NL*
is
too
industrious
a
word
for
the
lazy
sentiment
I
entertain
on
the
*NL*
subject
-RRB-
,
that
any
set
of
ideas
will
do
just
as
much
good
as
any
other
*NL*
set
,
and
just
as
much
harm
as
any
other
set
.
There
's
an
English
family
*NL*
with
a
charming
Italian
motto
.
What
will
be
,
will
be
.
It
's
the
only
*NL*
truth
going
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
vicious
assumption
of
honesty
in
dishonesty
--
a
vice
so
dangerous
,
so
*NL*
deadly
,
and
so
common
--
seemed
,
he
observed
,
a
little
to
impress
her
in
his
*NL*
favour
.
He
followed
up
the
advantage
,
by
saying
in
his
pleasantest
*NL*
manner
:
a
manner
to
which
she
might
attach
as
much
or
as
little
meaning
*NL*
as
she
pleased
:
`
The
side
that
can
prove
anything
in
a
line
of
units
,
*NL*
tens
,
hundreds
,
and
thousands
,
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
seems
to
me
to
afford
the
*NL*
most
fun
,
and
to
give
a
man
the
best
chance
.
I
am
quite
as
much
attached
*NL*
to
it
as
if
I
believed
it
.
I
am
quite
ready
to
go
in
for
it
,
to
the
same
*NL*
extent
as
if
I
believed
it
.
And
what
more
could
I
possibly
do
,
if
I
did
*NL*
believe
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
a
singular
politician
,
'
said
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pardon
me
;
I
have
not
even
that
merit
.
We
are
the
largest
party
in
the
*NL*
state
,
I
assure
you
,
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
if
we
all
fell
out
of
our
adopted
*NL*
ranks
and
were
reviewed
together
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
who
had
been
in
danger
of
bursting
in
silence
,
interposed
*NL*
here
with
a
project
for
postponing
the
family
dinner
till
half-past
six
,
*NL*
and
taking
Mr.
James
Harthouse
in
the
meantime
on
a
round
of
visits
to
*NL*
the
voting
and
interesting
notabilities
of
Coketown
and
its
vicinity
.
*NL*
The
round
of
visits
was
made
;
and
Mr.
James
Harthouse
,
with
a
discreet
*NL*
use
of
his
blue
coaching
,
came
off
triumphantly
,
though
with
a
*NL*
considerable
accession
of
boredom
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
he
found
the
dinner-table
laid
for
four
,
but
they
sat
*NL*
down
only
three
.
It
was
an
appropriate
occasion
for
Mr.
Bounderby
to
*NL*
discuss
the
flavour
of
the
hap
`
orth
of
stewed
eels
he
had
purchased
in
*NL*
the
streets
at
eight
years
old
;
and
also
of
the
inferior
water
,
specially
*NL*
used
for
laying
the
dust
,
with
which
he
had
washed
down
that
repast
.
He
*NL*
likewise
entertained
his
guest
over
the
soup
and
fish
,
with
the
*NL*
calculation
that
he
-LRB-
Bounderby
-RRB-
had
eaten
in
his
youth
at
least
three
*NL*
horses
under
the
guise
of
polonies
and
saveloys
.
These
recitals
,
Jem
,
in
*NL*
a
languid
manner
,
received
with
`
charming
!
'
every
now
and
then
;
and
they
*NL*
probably
would
have
decided
him
to
`
go
in
'
for
Jerusalem
again
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
,
had
he
been
less
curious
respecting
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
there
nothing
,
'
he
thought
,
glancing
at
her
as
she
sat
at
the
head
of
*NL*
the
table
,
where
her
youthful
figure
,
small
and
slight
,
but
very
*NL*
graceful
,
looked
as
pretty
as
it
looked
misplaced
;
`
is
there
nothing
that
*NL*
will
move
that
face
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
!
By
Jupiter
,
there
was
something
,
and
here
it
was
,
in
an
unexpected
*NL*
shape
.
Tom
appeared
.
She
changed
as
the
door
opened
,
and
broke
into
a
*NL*
beaming
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
beautiful
smile
.
Mr.
James
Harthouse
might
not
have
thought
so
much
of
*NL*
it
,
but
that
he
had
wondered
so
long
at
her
impassive
face
.
She
put
out
*NL*
her
hand
--
a
pretty
little
soft
hand
;
and
her
fingers
closed
upon
her
*NL*
brother
's
,
as
if
she
would
have
carried
them
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
ay
?
'
thought
the
visitor
.
`
This
whelp
is
the
only
creature
she
*NL*
cares
for
.
So
,
so
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
whelp
was
presented
,
and
took
his
chair
.
The
appellation
was
not
*NL*
flattering
,
but
not
unmerited
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
was
your
age
,
young
Tom
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
'
I
was
punctual
,
or
I
*NL*
got
no
dinner
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
you
were
my
age
,
'
resumed
Tom
,
`
you
had
n't
a
wrong
balance
to
get
*NL*
right
,
and
had
n't
to
dress
afterwards
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
that
now
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
then
,
'
grumbled
Tom
.
`
Do
n't
begin
with
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
'
said
Harthouse
,
perfectly
hearing
this
under-strain
as
*NL*
it
went
on
;
`
your
brother
's
face
is
quite
familiar
to
me
.
Can
I
have
*NL*
seen
him
abroad
?
Or
at
some
public
school
,
perhaps
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
she
resumed
,
quite
interested
,
`
he
has
never
been
abroad
yet
,
and
*NL*
was
educated
here
,
at
home
.
Tom
,
love
,
I
am
telling
Mr.
Harthouse
that
*NL*
he
never
saw
you
abroad
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
such
luck
,
sir
,
'
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
little
enough
in
him
to
brighten
her
face
,
for
he
was
a
sullen
*NL*
young
fellow
,
and
ungracious
in
his
manner
even
to
her
.
So
much
the
*NL*
greater
must
have
been
the
solitude
of
her
heart
,
and
her
need
of
some
*NL*
one
on
whom
to
bestow
it
.
`
So
much
the
more
is
this
whelp
the
only
*NL*
creature
she
has
ever
cared
for
,
'
thought
Mr.
James
Harthouse
,
turning
it
*NL*
over
and
over
.
`
So
much
the
more
.
So
much
the
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Both
in
his
sister
's
presence
,
and
after
she
had
left
the
room
,
the
whelp
*NL*
took
no
pains
to
hide
his
contempt
for
Mr.
Bounderby
,
whenever
he
could
*NL*
indulge
it
without
the
observation
of
that
independent
man
,
by
making
wry
*NL*
faces
,
or
shutting
one
eye
.
Without
responding
to
these
telegraphic
*NL*
communications
,
Mr.
Harthouse
encouraged
him
much
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
evening
,
and
showed
an
unusual
liking
for
him
.
At
last
,
when
he
rose
to
*NL*
return
to
his
hotel
,
and
was
a
little
doubtful
whether
he
knew
the
way
by
*NL*
night
,
the
whelp
immediately
proffered
his
services
as
guide
,
and
turned
*NL*
out
with
him
to
escort
him
thither
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
THE
WHELP
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
very
remarkable
that
a
young
gentleman
who
had
been
brought
up
*NL*
under
one
continuous
system
of
unnatural
restraint
,
should
be
a
*NL*
hypocrite
;
but
it
was
certainly
the
case
with
Tom
.
It
was
very
strange
*NL*
that
a
young
gentleman
who
had
never
been
left
to
his
own
guidance
for
*NL*
five
consecutive
minutes
,
should
be
incapable
at
last
of
governing
*NL*
himself
;
but
so
it
was
with
Tom
.
It
was
altogether
unaccountable
that
a
*NL*
young
gentleman
whose
imagination
had
been
strangled
in
his
cradle
,
*NL*
should
be
still
inconvenienced
by
its
ghost
in
the
form
of
grovelling
*NL*
sensualities
;
but
such
a
monster
,
beyond
all
doubt
,
was
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
smoke
?
'
asked
Mr.
James
Harthouse
,
when
they
came
to
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
believe
you
!
'
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
do
no
less
than
ask
Tom
up
;
and
Tom
could
do
no
less
than
go
up
.
*NL*
What
with
a
cooling
drink
adapted
to
the
weather
,
but
not
so
weak
as
*NL*
cool
;
and
what
with
a
rarer
tobacco
than
was
to
be
bought
in
those
parts
;
*NL*
Tom
was
soon
in
a
highly
free
and
easy
state
at
his
end
of
the
sofa
,
and
*NL*
more
than
ever
disposed
to
admire
his
new
friend
at
the
other
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
blew
his
smoke
aside
,
after
he
had
been
smoking
a
little
while
,
and
*NL*
took
an
observation
of
his
friend
.
`
He
do
n't
seem
to
care
about
his
*NL*
dress
,
'
thought
Tom
,
`
and
yet
how
capitally
he
does
it
.
What
an
easy
*NL*
swell
he
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
James
Harthouse
,
happening
to
catch
Tom
's
eye
,
remarked
that
he
drank
*NL*
nothing
,
and
filled
his
glass
with
his
own
negligent
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
`
ee
,
'
said
Tom
.
`
Thank
`
ee
.
Well
,
Mr.
Harthouse
,
I
hope
you
have
*NL*
had
about
a
dose
of
old
Bounderby
to-night
.
'
Tom
said
this
with
one
eye
*NL*
shut
up
again
,
and
looking
over
his
glass
knowingly
,
at
his
entertainer
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
very
good
fellow
indeed
!
'
returned
Mr.
James
Harthouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
think
so
,
do
n't
you
?
'
said
Tom
.
And
shut
up
his
eye
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
James
Harthouse
smiled
;
and
rising
from
his
end
of
the
sofa
,
and
*NL*
lounging
with
his
back
against
the
chimney-piece
,
so
that
he
stood
before
*NL*
the
empty
fire-grate
as
he
smoked
,
in
front
of
Tom
and
looking
down
at
*NL*
him
,
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
comical
brother-in-law
you
are
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
comical
brother-in-law
old
Bounderby
is
,
I
think
you
mean
,
'
said
*NL*
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
a
piece
of
caustic
,
Tom
,
'
retorted
Mr.
James
Harthouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
so
very
agreeable
in
being
so
intimate
with
such
a
*NL*
waistcoat
;
in
being
called
Tom
,
in
such
an
intimate
way
,
by
such
a
voice
;
*NL*
in
being
on
such
off-hand
terms
so
soon
,
with
such
a
pair
of
whiskers
;
*NL*
that
Tom
was
uncommonly
pleased
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
I
do
n't
care
for
old
Bounderby
,
'
said
he
,
`
if
you
mean
that
.
I
*NL*
have
always
called
old
Bounderby
by
the
same
name
when
I
have
talked
*NL*
about
him
,
and
I
have
always
thought
of
him
in
the
same
way
.
I
am
not
*NL*
going
to
begin
to
be
polite
now
,
about
old
Bounderby
.
It
would
be
rather
*NL*
late
in
the
day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
mind
me
,
'
returned
James
;
`
but
take
care
when
his
wife
is
by
,
you
*NL*
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
wife
?
'
said
Tom
.
`
My
sister
Loo
?
O
yes
!
'
And
he
laughed
,
and
took
*NL*
a
little
more
of
the
cooling
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
James
Harthouse
continued
to
lounge
in
the
same
place
and
attitude
,
*NL*
smoking
his
cigar
in
his
own
easy
way
,
and
looking
pleasantly
at
the
*NL*
whelp
,
as
if
he
knew
himself
to
be
a
kind
of
agreeable
demon
who
had
only
*NL*
to
hover
over
him
,
and
he
must
give
up
his
whole
soul
if
required
.
It
*NL*
certainly
did
seem
that
the
whelp
yielded
to
this
influence
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
his
companion
sneakingly
,
he
looked
at
him
admiringly
,
he
looked
at
*NL*
him
boldly
,
and
put
up
one
leg
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
sister
Loo
?
'
said
Tom
.
'
_
She
_
never
cared
for
old
Bounderby
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
the
past
tense
,
Tom
,
'
returned
Mr.
James
Harthouse
,
striking
the
*NL*
ash
from
his
cigar
with
his
little
finger
.
`
We
are
in
the
present
tense
,
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
`
Verb

'
returned
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good

Very

'
said
his
friend
.
`
Though
you
do
n't
mean
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
_
do

'
cried
Tom
.
`
Upon
my
honour
!
Why
,
you
wo
n't
tell
*NL*
me
,
Mr.
Harthouse
,
that

the

`

'
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
by
this
time
got
both
his
legs
on
the
sofa
.
If
his
second
leg
*NL*
had
not
been
already
there
when
he
was
called
a
dear
fellow
,
he
would
*NL*
have
put
it
up
at
that
great
stage
of
the
conversation
.
Feeling
it
*NL*
necessary
to
do
something
then
,
he
stretched
himself
out
at
greater
*NL*
length
,
and
,
reclining
with
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
,
*NL*
and
smoking
with
an
infinite
assumption
of
negligence
,
turned
his
common
*NL*
face
,
and
not
too
sober
eyes
,
towards
the
face
looking
down
upon
him
so
*NL*
carelessly
yet
so
potently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
know
our
governor
,
Mr.
Harthouse
,
'
said
Tom
,
`
and
therefore
,
you
*NL*
need
n't
be
surprised
that
Loo
married
old
Bounderby
.
She
never
had
a
*NL*
lover
,
and
the
governor
proposed
old
Bounderby
,
and
she
took
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
dutiful
in
your
interesting
sister
,
'
said
Mr.
James
Harthouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
but
she
would
n't
have
been
as
dutiful
,
and
it
would
not
have
come
*NL*
off
as
easily
,
'
returned
the
whelp
,
`
if
it
had
n't
been
for
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
tempter
merely
lifted
his
eyebrows
;
but
the
whelp
was
obliged
to
go
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
persuaded
her
,
'
he
said
,
with
an
edifying
air
of
superiority
.
'
I
*NL*
was
stuck
into
old
Bounderby
's
bank
-LRB-
where
I
never
wanted
to
be
-RRB-
,
and
I
*NL*
knew
I
should
get
into
scrapes
there
,
if
she
put
old
Bounderby
's
pipe
*NL*
out
;
so
I
told
her
my
wishes
,
and
she
came
into
them
.
She
would
do
*NL*
anything
for
me
.
It
was
very
game
of
her
,
was
n't
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
charming
,
Tom
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
that
it
was
altogether
so
important
to
her
as
it
was
to
me
,
'
*NL*
continued
Tom
coolly
,
`
because
my
liberty
and
comfort
,
and
perhaps
my
*NL*
getting
on
,
depended
on
it
;
and
she
had
no
other
lover
,
and
staying
at
*NL*
home
was
like
staying
in
jail
--
especially
when
I
was
gone
.
It
was
n't
as
*NL*
if
she
gave
up
another
lover
for
old
Bounderby
;
but
still
it
was
a
good
*NL*
thing
in
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perfectly
delightful
.
And
she
gets
on
so
placidly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
'
returned
Tom
,
with
contemptuous
patronage
,
`
she
's
a
regular
girl
.
*NL*
A
girl
can
get
on
anywhere
.
She
has
settled
down
to
the
life
,
and
_
she
_
*NL*
do
n't
mind
.
It
does
just
as
well
as
another
.
Besides
,
though
Loo
is
a
*NL*
girl
,
she
's
not
a
common
sort
of
girl
.
She
can
shut
herself
up
within
*NL*
herself
,
and
think
--
as
I
have
often
known
her
sit
and
watch
the
fire
--
for
*NL*
an
hour
at
a
stretch
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
ay
?
Has
resources
of
her
own
,
'
said
Harthouse
,
smoking
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
so
much
of
that
as
you
may
suppose
,
'
returned
Tom
;
`
for
our
governor
*NL*
had
her
crammed
with
all
sorts
of
dry
bones
and
sawdust
.
It
's
his
*NL*
system
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Formed
his
daughter
on
his
own
model
?
'
suggested
Harthouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
daughter
?
Ah
!
and
everybody
else
.
Why
,
he
formed
Me
that
way
!
'
*NL*
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Impossible
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
did
,
though
,
'
said
Tom
,
shaking
his
head
.
'
I
mean
to
say
,
Mr.
*NL*
Harthouse
,
that
when
I
first
left
home
and
went
to
old
Bounderby
's
,
I
was
*NL*
as
flat
as
a
warming-pan
,
and
knew
no
more
about
life
,
than
any
oyster
*NL*
does
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
Tom
!
I
can
hardly
believe
that
.
A
joke
's
a
joke
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Upon
my
soul
!
'
said
the
whelp
.
'
I
am
serious
;
I
am
indeed
!
'
He
smoked
*NL*
with
great
gravity
and
dignity
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
added
,
in
a
*NL*
highly
complacent
tone
,
`
Oh
!
I
have
picked
up
a
little
since
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
deny
that
.
But
I
have
done
it
myself
;
no
thanks
to
the
governor
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
your
intelligent
sister
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
intelligent
sister
is
about
where
she
was
.
She
used
to
complain
to
*NL*
me
that
she
had
nothing
to
fall
back
upon
,
that
girls
usually
fall
back
*NL*
upon
;
and
I
do
n't
see
how
she
is
to
have
got
over
that
since
.
But
_
she
_
*NL*
do
n't
mind
,
'
he
sagaciously
added
,
puffing
at
his
cigar
again
.
`
Girls
*NL*
can
always
get
on
,
somehow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Calling
at
the
Bank
yesterday
evening
,
for
Mr.
Bounderby
's
address
,
I
*NL*
found
an
ancient
lady
there
,
who
seems
to
entertain
great
admiration
for
*NL*
your
sister
,
'
observed
Mr.
James
Harthouse
,
throwing
away
the
last
small
*NL*
remnant
of
the
cigar
he
had
now
smoked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mother
Sparsit
!
'
said
Tom
.
`
What
!
you
have
seen
her
already
,
have
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
nodded
.
Tom
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
,
to
shut
up
his
*NL*
eye
-LRB-
which
had
grown
rather
unmanageable
-RRB-
with
the
greater
expression
,
*NL*
and
to
tap
his
nose
several
times
with
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mother
Sparsit
's
feeling
for
Loo
is
more
than
admiration
,
I
should
*NL*
think
,
'
said
Tom
.
`
Say
affection
and
devotion
.
Mother
Sparsit
never
set
*NL*
her
cap
at
Bounderby
when
he
was
a
bachelor
.
Oh
no
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
last
words
spoken
by
the
whelp
,
before
a
giddy
drowsiness
*NL*
came
upon
him
,
followed
by
complete
oblivion
.
He
was
roused
from
the
*NL*
latter
state
by
an
uneasy
dream
of
being
stirred
up
with
a
boot
,
and
also
*NL*
of
a
voice
saying
:
`
Come
,
it
's
late
.
Be
off
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
he
said
,
scrambling
from
the
sofa
.
'
I
must
take
my
leave
of
you
*NL*
though
.
I
say
.
Yours
is
very
good
tobacco
.
But
it
's
too
mild
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
it
's
too
mild
,
'
returned
his
entertainer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
--
it
's
ridiculously
mild
,
'
said
Tom
.
`
Where
's
the
door
!
Good
*NL*
night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
another
odd
dream
of
being
taken
by
a
waiter
through
a
mist
,
*NL*
which
,
after
giving
him
some
trouble
and
difficulty
,
resolved
itself
into
*NL*
the
main
street
,
in
which
he
stood
alone
.
He
then
walked
home
pretty
*NL*
easily
,
though
not
yet
free
from
an
impression
of
the
presence
and
*NL*
influence
of
his
new
friend
--
as
if
he
were
lounging
somewhere
in
the
air
,
*NL*
in
the
same
negligent
attitude
,
regarding
him
with
the
same
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whelp
went
home
,
and
went
to
bed
.
If
he
had
had
any
sense
of
what
he
*NL*
had
done
that
night
,
and
had
been
less
of
a
whelp
and
more
of
a
brother
,
*NL*
he
might
have
turned
short
on
the
road
,
might
have
gone
down
to
the
*NL*
ill-smelling
river
that
was
dyed
black
,
might
have
gone
to
bed
in
it
for
*NL*
good
and
all
,
and
have
curtained
his
head
for
ever
with
its
filthy
*NL*
waters
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
MEN
AND
BROTHERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
OH
,
my
friends
,
the
down-trodden
operatives
of
Coketown
!
Oh
,
my
friends
*NL*
and
fellow-countrymen
,
the
slaves
of
an
iron-handed
and
a
grinding
*NL*
despotism
!
Oh
,
my
friends
and
fellow-sufferers
,
and
fellow-workmen
,
and
*NL*
fellow-men
!
I
tell
you
that
the
hour
is
come
,
when
we
must
rally
round
*NL*
one
another
as
One
united
power
,
and
crumble
into
dust
the
oppressors
*NL*
that
too
long
have
battened
upon
the
plunder
of
our
families
,
upon
the
*NL*
sweat
of
our
brows
,
upon
the
labour
of
our
hands
,
upon
the
strength
of
*NL*
our
sinews
,
upon
the
God-created
glorious
rights
of
Humanity
,
and
upon
*NL*
the
holy
and
eternal
privileges
of
Brotherhood
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
!
'
`
Hear
,
hear
,
hear
!
'
`
Hurrah
!
'
and
other
cries
,
arose
in
many
*NL*
voices
from
various
parts
of
the
densely
crowded
and
suffocatingly
close
*NL*
Hall
,
in
which
the
orator
,
perched
on
a
stage
,
delivered
himself
of
this
*NL*
and
what
other
froth
and
fume
he
had
in
him
.
He
had
declaimed
himself
*NL*
into
a
violent
heat
,
and
was
as
hoarse
as
he
was
hot
.
By
dint
of
roaring
*NL*
at
the
top
of
his
voice
under
a
flaring
gaslight
,
clenching
his
fists
,
*NL*
knitting
his
brows
,
setting
his
teeth
,
and
pounding
with
his
arms
,
he
had
*NL*
taken
so
much
out
of
himself
by
this
time
,
that
he
was
brought
to
a
stop
,
*NL*
and
called
for
a
glass
of
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
stood
there
,
trying
to
quench
his
fiery
face
with
his
drink
of
*NL*
water
,
the
comparison
between
the
orator
and
the
crowd
of
attentive
faces
*NL*
turned
towards
him
,
was
extremely
to
his
disadvantage
.
Judging
him
by
*NL*
Nature
's
evidence
,
he
was
above
the
mass
in
very
little
but
the
stage
on
*NL*
which
he
stood
.
In
many
great
respects
he
was
essentially
below
them
.
*NL*
He
was
not
so
honest
,
he
was
not
so
manly
,
he
was
not
so
good-humoured
;
*NL*
he
substituted
cunning
for
their
simplicity
,
and
passion
for
their
safe
*NL*
solid
sense
.
An
ill-made
,
high-shouldered
man
,
with
lowering
brows
,
and
*NL*
his
features
crushed
into
an
habitually
sour
expression
,
he
contrasted
*NL*
most
unfavourably
,
even
in
his
mongrel
dress
,
with
the
great
body
of
his
*NL*
hearers
in
their
plain
working
clothes
.
Strange
as
it
always
is
to
*NL*
consider
any
assembly
in
the
act
of
submissively
resigning
itself
to
the
*NL*
dreariness
of
some
complacent
person
,
lord
or
commoner
,
whom
*NL*
three-fourths
of
it
could
,
by
no
human
means
,
raise
out
of
the
slough
of
*NL*
inanity
to
their
own
intellectual
level
,
it
was
particularly
strange
,
and
*NL*
it
was
even
particularly
affecting
,
to
see
this
crowd
of
earnest
faces
,
*NL*
whose
honesty
in
the
main
no
competent
observer
free
from
bias
could
*NL*
doubt
,
so
agitated
by
such
a
leader
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
!
Hear
,
hear
!
Hurrah
!
The
eagerness
both
of
attention
and
*NL*
intention
,
exhibited
in
all
the
countenances
,
made
them
a
most
impressive
*NL*
sight
.
There
was
no
carelessness
,
no
languor
,
no
idle
curiosity
;
none
of
*NL*
the
many
shades
of
indifference
to
be
seen
in
all
other
assemblies
,
*NL*
visible
for
one
moment
there
.
That
every
man
felt
his
condition
to
be
,
*NL*
somehow
or
other
,
worse
than
it
might
be
;
that
every
man
considered
it
*NL*
incumbent
on
him
to
join
the
rest
,
towards
the
making
of
it
better
;
that
*NL*
every
man
felt
his
only
hope
to
be
in
his
allying
himself
to
the
comrades
*NL*
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
;
and
that
in
this
belief
,
right
or
wrong
*NL*
-LRB-
unhappily
wrong
then
-RRB-
,
the
whole
of
that
crowd
were
gravely
,
deeply
,
*NL*
faithfully
in
earnest
;
must
have
been
as
plain
to
any
one
who
chose
to
*NL*
see
what
was
there
,
as
the
bare
beams
of
the
roof
and
the
whitened
brick
*NL*
walls
.
Nor
could
any
such
spectator
fail
to
know
in
his
own
breast
,
that
*NL*
these
men
,
through
their
very
delusions
,
showed
great
qualities
,
*NL*
susceptible
of
being
turned
to
the
happiest
and
best
account
;
and
that
to
*NL*
pretend
-LRB-
on
the
strength
of
sweeping
axioms
,
howsoever
cut
and
dried
-RRB-
*NL*
that
they
went
astray
wholly
without
cause
,
and
of
their
own
irrational
*NL*
wills
,
was
to
pretend
that
there
could
be
smoke
without
fire
,
death
*NL*
without
birth
,
harvest
without
seed
,
anything
or
everything
produced
from
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
orator
having
refreshed
himself
,
wiped
his
corrugated
forehead
from
*NL*
left
to
right
several
times
with
his
handkerchief
folded
into
a
pad
,
and
*NL*
concentrated
all
his
revived
forces
,
in
a
sneer
of
great
disdain
and
*NL*
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
oh
,
my
friends
and
brothers
!
Oh
,
men

Englishmen

*NL*
down-trodden
operatives

shall
we
say
of

man

that
*NL*
working-man

that
I
should
find

necessary

to

well

with

grievances

him
to
be

at

deserts
his

post

sells
his
flag

at

a

turns
a
traitor

*NL*
craven

at

not
ashamed

make
to

the
dastardly

avowal

The

was
divided
at
this
point
.
There
were
some
groans
and
*NL*
hisses
,
but
the
general
sense
of
honour
was
much
too
strong
for
the
*NL*
condemnation
of
a
man
unheard
.
`
Be
sure
you
're
right
,
Slackbridge
!
'
*NL*
`
Put
him
up
!
'
`
Let
's
hear
him
!
'
Such
things
were
said
on
many
sides
.
*NL*
Finally
,
one
strong
voice
called
out
,
`
Is
the
man
heer
?
If
the
man
's
*NL*
heer
,
Slackbridge
,
let
's
hear
the
man
himseln
,
`
stead
o
'
yo
.
'
Which
was
*NL*
received
with
a
round
of
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slackbridge
,
the
orator
,
looked
about
him
with
a
withering
smile
;
and
,
*NL*
holding
out
his
right
hand
at
arm
's
length
-LRB-
as
the
manner
of
all
*NL*
Slackbridges
is
-RRB-
,
to
still
the
thundering
sea
,
waited
until
there
was
a
*NL*
profound
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
my
friends
and
fellow-men
!
'
said
Slackbridge
then
,
shaking
his
head
*NL*
with
violent
scorn
,
'
I
do
not
wonder
that
you
,
the
prostrate
sons
of
*NL*
labour
,
are
incredulous
of
the
existence
of
such
a
man
.
But
he
who
sold
*NL*
his
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
existed
,
and
Judas
Iscariot
existed
,
*NL*
and
Castlereagh
existed
,
and
this
man
exists
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
a
brief
press
and
confusion
near
the
stage
,
ended
in
the
man
*NL*
himself
standing
at
the
orator
's
side
before
the
concourse
.
He
was
pale
*NL*
and
a
little
moved
in
the
face
--
his
lips
especially
showed
it
;
but
he
*NL*
stood
quiet
,
with
his
left
hand
at
his
chin
,
waiting
to
be
heard
.
There
*NL*
was
a
chairman
to
regulate
the
proceedings
,
and
this
functionary
now
took
*NL*
the
case
into
his
own
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
friends
,
'
said
he
,
`
by
virtue
o
'
my
office
as
your
president
,
I
askes
*NL*
o
'
our
friend
Slackbridge
,
who
may
be
a
little
over
hetter
in
this
*NL*
business
,
to
take
his
seat
,
whiles
this
man
Stephen
Blackpool
is
heern
.
*NL*
You
all
know
this
man
Stephen
Blackpool
.
You
know
him
awlung
o
'
his
*NL*
misfort
`
ns
,
and
his
good
name
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
,
the
chairman
shook
him
frankly
by
the
hand
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
again
.
Slackbridge
likewise
sat
down
,
wiping
his
hot
forehead
--
always
*NL*
from
left
to
right
,
and
never
the
reverse
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
friends
,
'
Stephen
began
,
in
the
midst
of
a
dead
calm
;
'
I
ha
'
hed
*NL*
what
's
been
spok
'n
o
'
me
,
and
't
is
lickly
that
I
sha
n't
mend
it
.
But
I
'd
*NL*
liefer
you
'd
hearn
the
truth
concernin
myseln
,
fro
my
lips

fro

,
though
I
never
cud
'n
speak
afore
so
monny
,
wi'out
bein
*NL*
moydert
and
muddled
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Slackbridge
shook
his
head
as
if
he
would
shake
it
off
,
in
his
*NL*
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I

'

Licker

'
*NL*
*NL*
Slackbridge
laughed
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
frowned
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
'
t
a
n't
sommuch
for
that
as
I
stands
out
.
If
that
were
aw
,
I
'd
coom
*NL*
in
wi
'
th
'
rest
.
But
I
ha
'
my
reasons
--
mine
,
yo
see
--
for
being
hindered
;
*NL*
not
on
'
y
now
,
but
awlus
--
awlus
--
life
long
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Slackbridge
jumped
up
and
stood
beside
him
,
gnashing
and
tearing
.
`
Oh
,
*NL*
my
friends
,
what
but
this
did
I
tell
you
?
Oh
,
my
fellow-countrymen
,
what
*NL*
warning
but
this
did
I
give
you
?
And
how
shows
this
recreant
conduct
in
*NL*
a
man
on
whom
unequal
laws
are
known
to
have
fallen
heavy
?
Oh
,
you
*NL*
Englishmen
,
I
ask
you
how
does
this
subornation
show
in
one
of
*NL*
yourselves
,
who
is
thus
consenting
to
his
own
undoing
and
to
yours
,
and
*NL*
to
your
children
's
and
your
children
's
children
's
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
applause
,
and
some
crying
of
Shame
upon
the
man
;
but
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
the
audience
were
quiet
.
They
looked
at
Stephen
's
worn
*NL*
face
,
rendered
more
pathetic
by
the
homely
emotions
it
evinced
;
and
,
in
*NL*
the
kindness
of
their
nature
,
they
were
more
sorry
than
indignant
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
Tis
this
Delegate
's
trade
for
t
'
speak
,
'
said
Stephen
,
`
an
'
he
's
paid
*NL*
for
`
t
,
an
'
he
knows
his
work
.
Let
him
keep
to
`
t.
Let
him
give
no
heed
*NL*
to
what
I
ha
had
'n
to
bear
.
That
's
not
for
him
.
That
's
not
for
nobbody
*NL*
but
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
propriety
,
not
to
say
a
dignity
in
these
words
,
that
made
the
*NL*
hearers
yet
more
quiet
and
attentive
.
The
same
strong
voice
called
out
,
*NL*
`
Slackbridge
,
let
the
man
be
heern
,
and
howd
thee
tongue
!
'
Then
the
*NL*
place
was
wonderfully
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
brothers
,
'
said
Stephen
,
whose
low
voice
was
distinctly
heard
,
`
and
*NL*
my
fellow-workmen
--
for
that
yo
are
to
me
,
though
not
,
as
I
knows
on
,
to
*NL*
this

here
--
I
ha
but
a
word
to
sen
,
and
I
could
sen
nommore
if

was
to
speak
till

I

that
if

i

yo
'd
feel

*NL*
*NL*
`
Stephen

'
said
the
chairman
,
rising
,
`
think
on

t

Think
*NL*
on

t
once

lad
,
afore

'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
universal
murmur
to
the
same
effect
,
though
no
man
*NL*
articulated
a
word
.
Every
eye
was
fixed
on
Stephen
's
face
.
To
repent
of
*NL*
his
determination
,
would
be
to
take
a
load
from
all
their
minds
.
He
*NL*
looked
around
him
,
and
knew
that
it
was
so
.
Not
a
grain
of
anger
with
*NL*
them
was
in
his
heart
;
he
knew
them
,
far
below
their
surface
weaknesses
*NL*
and
misconceptions
,
as
no
one
but
their
fellow-labourer
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I

'
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
sort
of
reverence
to
them
by
holding
up
his
arms
,
and
stood
for
*NL*
the
moment
in
that
attitude
;
not
speaking
until
they
slowly
dropped
at
*NL*
his
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Monny
's
the
pleasant
word
as

has

that
--
yo
I

say

'
addressing
Slackbridge
,
`
but
't
is
*NL*
easier
to
ca

than
mak
'
out
.
So
let
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
moved
away
a
pace
or
two
to
come
down
from
the
platform
,
when
he
*NL*
remembered
something
he
had
not
said
,
and
returned
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Haply
,
'
he
said
,
turning
his
furrowed
face
slowly
about
,
that
he
might
*NL*
as
it
were
individually
address
the
whole
audience
,
those
both
near
and
*NL*
distant
;
`
haply
,
when
this
question
has
been
tak
'n
up
and
discoosed
,
*NL*
there
'll
be
a
threat
to
turn
out
if
I
'm
let

I
hope
I
*NL*
shall
die
ere
ever
such
a

and
I
shall
work
solitary
among

*NL*
unless

truly

I

not

If
there
is
any
*NL*
right
for
me
at
aw
,
my
friends
,
I
think
't
is
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
word
was
spoken
.
Not
a
sound
was
audible
in
the
building
,
but
the
*NL*
slight
rustle
of
men
moving
a
little
apart
,
all
along
the
centre
of
the
*NL*
room
,
to
open
a
means
of
passing
out
,
to
the
man
with
whom
they
had
all
*NL*
bound
themselves
to
renounce
companionship
.
Looking
at
no
one
,
and
going
*NL*
his
way
with
a
lowly
steadiness
upon
him
that
asserted
nothing
and
sought
*NL*
nothing
,
Old
Stephen
,
with
all
his
troubles
on
his
head
,
left
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Slackbridge
,
who
had
kept
his
oratorical
arm
extended
during
the
*NL*
going
out
,
as
if
he
were
repressing
with
infinite
solicitude
and
by
a
*NL*
wonderful
moral
power
the
vehement
passions
of
the
multitude
,
applied
*NL*
himself
to
raising
their
spirits
.
Had
not
the
Roman
Brutus
,
oh
,
my
*NL*
British
countrymen
,
condemned
his
son
to
death
;
and
had
not
the
Spartan
*NL*
mothers
,
oh
my
soon
to
be
victorious
friends
,
driven
their
flying
*NL*
children
on
the
points
of
their
enemies
'
swords
?
Then
was
it
not
the
*NL*
sacred
duty
of
the
men
of
Coketown
,
with
forefathers
before
them
,
an
*NL*
admiring
world
in
company
with
them
,
and
a
posterity
to
come
after
them
,
*NL*
to
hurl
out
traitors
from
the
tents
they
had
pitched
in
a
sacred
and
a
*NL*
God-like
cause
?
The
winds
of
heaven
answered
Yes
;
and
bore
Yes
,
east
,
*NL*
west
,
north
,
and
south
.
And
consequently
three
cheers
for
the
United
*NL*
Aggregate
Tribunal
!
*NL*
*NL*
Slackbridge
acted
as
fugleman
,
and
gave
the
time
.
The
multitude
of
*NL*
doubtful
faces
-LRB-
a
little
conscience-stricken
-RRB-
brightened
at
the
sound
,
*NL*
and
took
it
up
.
Private
feeling
must
yield
to
the
common
cause
.
Hurrah
!
*NL*
The
roof
yet
vibrated
with
the
cheering
,
when
the
assembly
dispersed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
easily
did
Stephen
Blackpool
fall
into
the
loneliest
of
lives
,
the
*NL*
life
of
solitude
among
a
familiar
crowd
.
The
stranger
in
the
land
who
*NL*
looks
into
ten
thousand
faces
for
some
answering
look
and
never
finds
it
,
*NL*
is
in
cheering
society
as
compared
with
him
who
passes
ten
averted
faces
*NL*
daily
,
that
were
once
the
countenances
of
friends
.
Such
experience
was
*NL*
to
be
Stephen
's
now
,
in
every
waking
moment
of
his
life
;
at
his
work
,
on
*NL*
his
way
to
it
and
from
it
,
at
his
door
,
at
his
window
,
everywhere
.
By
*NL*
general
consent
,
they
even
avoided
that
side
of
the
street
on
which
he
*NL*
habitually
walked
;
and
left
it
,
of
all
the
working
men
,
to
him
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
for
many
years
,
a
quiet
silent
man
,
associating
but
little
*NL*
with
other
men
,
and
used
to
companionship
with
his
own
thoughts
.
He
had
*NL*
never
known
before
the
strength
of
the
want
in
his
heart
for
the
frequent
*NL*
recognition
of
a
nod
,
a
look
,
a
word
;
or
the
immense
amount
of
relief
*NL*
that
had
been
poured
into
it
by
drops
through
such
small
means
.
It
was
*NL*
even
harder
than
he
could
have
believed
possible
,
to
separate
in
his
own
*NL*
conscience
his
abandonment
by
all
his
fellows
from
a
baseless
sense
of
*NL*
shame
and
disgrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
four
days
of
his
endurance
were
days
so
long
and
heavy
,
that
he
*NL*
began
to
be
appalled
by
the
prospect
before
him
.
Not
only
did
he
see
no
*NL*
Rachael
all
the
time
,
but
he
avoided
every
chance
of
seeing
her
;
for
,
*NL*
although
he
knew
that
the
prohibition
did
not
yet
formally
extend
to
the
*NL*
women
working
in
the
factories
,
he
found
that
some
of
them
with
whom
he
*NL*
was
acquainted
were
changed
to
him
,
and
he
feared
to
try
others
,
and
*NL*
dreaded
that
Rachael
might
be
even
singled
out
from
the
rest
if
she
were
*NL*
seen
in
his
company
.
So
,
he
had
been
quite
alone
during
the
four
days
,
*NL*
and
had
spoken
to
no
one
,
when
,
as
he
was
leaving
his
work
at
night
,
a
*NL*
young
man
of
a
very
light
complexion
accosted
him
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
name
's
Blackpool
,
ai
n't
it
?
'
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
coloured
to
find
himself
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
in
his
*NL*
gratitude
for
being
spoken
to
,
or
in
the
suddenness
of
it
,
or
both
.
He
*NL*
made
a
feint
of
adjusting
the
lining
,
and
said
,
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
the
Hand
they
have
sent
to
Coventry
,
I
mean
?
'
said
Bitzer
,
the
*NL*
very
light
young
man
in
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
answered
`
Yes
,
'
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
supposed
so
,
from
their
all
appearing
to
keep
away
from
you
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
wants
to
speak
to
you
.
You
know
his
house
,
do
n't
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
said
`
Yes
,
'
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
go
straight
up
there
,
will
you
?
'
said
Bitzer
.
`
You
're
expected
,
*NL*
and
have
only
to
tell
the
servant
it
's
you
.
I
belong
to
the
Bank
;
so
,
if
*NL*
you
go
straight
up
without
me
-LRB-
I
was
sent
to
fetch
you
-RRB-
,
you
'll
save
me
a
*NL*
walk
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
whose
way
had
been
in
the
contrary
direction
,
turned
about
,
and
*NL*
betook
himself
as
in
duty
bound
,
to
the
red
brick
castle
of
the
giant
*NL*
Bounderby

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
MEN
AND
MASTERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
WELL
,
Stephen
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
in
his
windy
manner
,
`
what
's
this
I
*NL*
hear
?
What
have
these
pests
of
the
earth
been
doing
to
_
you
_
?
Come
in
,
*NL*
and
speak
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
into
the
drawing-room
that
he
was
thus
bidden
.
A
tea-table
was
*NL*
set
out
;
and
Mr.
Bounderby
's
young
wife
,
and
her
brother
,
and
a
great
*NL*
gentleman
from
London
,
were
present
.
To
whom
Stephen
made
his
obeisance
,
*NL*
closing
the
door
and
standing
near
it
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
the
man
I
was
telling
you
about
,
Harthouse
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
*NL*
The
gentleman
he
addressed
,
who
was
talking
to
Mrs.
Bounderby
on
the
*NL*
sofa
,
got
up
,
saying
in
an
indolent
way
,
`
Oh
really
?
'
and
dawdled
to
the
*NL*
hearthrug
where
Mr.
Bounderby
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
speak
up
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
four
days
he
had
passed
,
this
address
fell
rudely
and
*NL*
discordantly
on
Stephen
's
ear
.
Besides
being
a
rough
handling
of
his
*NL*
wounded
mind
,
it
seemed
to
assume
that
he
really
was
the
self-interested
*NL*
deserter
he
had
been
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
were
it
,
sir
,
'
said
Stephen
,
`
as
yo
were
pleased
to
want
wi
'
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
have
told
you
,
'
returned
Bounderby
.
`
Speak
up
like
a
man
,
since
*NL*
you
are
a
man
,
and
tell
us
about
yourself
and
this
Combination
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wi
'
yor
pardon
,
sir
,
'
said
Stephen
Blackpool
,
'
I
ha
'
nowt
to
sen
about
*NL*
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
who
was
always
more
or
less
like
a
Wind
,
finding
something
*NL*
in
his
way
here
,
began
to
blow
at
it
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
look
here
,
Harthouse
,
'
said
he
,
`
here
's
a
specimen
of
'em
.
When
*NL*
this
man
was
here
once
before
,
I
warned
this
man
against
the
mischievous
*NL*
strangers
who
are
always
about
--
and
who
ought
to
be
hanged
wherever
they
*NL*
are
found
--
and
I
told
this
man
that
he
was
going
in
the
wrong
direction
.
*NL*
Now
,
would
you
believe
it
,
that
although
they
have
put
this
mark
upon
*NL*
him
,
he
is
such
a
slave
to
them
still
,
that
he
's
afraid
to
open
his
lips
*NL*
about
them
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
sed
as
I
had
nowt
to
sen
,
sir
;
not
as
I
was
fearfo
'
o
'
openin
'
my
*NL*
lips
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
said
!
Ah
!
_
I
_
know
what
you
said
;
more
than
that
,
I
know
what
you
*NL*
mean
,
you
see
.
Not
always
the
same
thing
,
by
the
Lord
Harry
!
Quite
*NL*
different
things
.
You
had
better
tell
us
at
once
,
that
that
fellow
*NL*
Slackbridge
is
not
in
the
town
,
stirring
up
the
people
to
mutiny
;
and
*NL*
that
he
is
not
a
regular
qualified
leader
of
the
people
:
that
is
,
a
most
*NL*
confounded
scoundrel
.
You
had
better
tell
us
so
at
once
;
you
ca
n't
*NL*
deceive
me
.
You
want
to
tell
us
so
.
Why
do
n't
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
as
sooary
as
yo
,
sir
,
when
the
people
's
leaders
is
bad
,
'
said
*NL*
Stephen
,
shaking
his
head
.
`
They
taks
such
as
offers
.
Haply
't
is
na
'
*NL*
the
sma'est
o
'
their
misfortuns
when
they
can
get
no
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
began
to
get
boisterous
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
you
'll
think
this
pretty
well
,
Harthouse
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
*NL*
`
You
'll
think
this
tolerably
strong
.
You
'll
say
,
upon
my
soul
this
is
a
*NL*
tidy
specimen
of
what
my
friends
have
to
deal
with
;
but
this
is
nothing
,
*NL*
sir
!
You
shall
hear
me
ask
this
man
a
question
.
Pray
,
Mr.
*NL*
Blackpool
'
--
wind
springing
up
very
fast
--
`
may
I
take
the
liberty
of
asking
*NL*
you
how
it
happens
that
you
refused
to
be
in
this
Combination
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
'
t
happens
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
with
his
thumbs
in
the
arms
of
his
coat
,
and
*NL*
jerking
his
head
and
shutting
his
eyes
in
confidence
with
the
opposite
*NL*
wall
:
`
how
it
happens
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'd
leefer
not
coom
to
`
t
,
sir
;
but
sin
you
put
th
'
question
--
an
'
not
*NL*
want
'n
t
'
be
ill-manner
`
n
--
I
'll
answer
.
I
ha
passed
a
promess
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
to
me
,
you
know
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
-LRB-
Gusty
weather
with
deceitful
*NL*
calms
.
One
now
prevailing
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
no
,
sir
.
Not
to
yo
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
for
me
,
any
consideration
for
me
has
had
just
nothing
at
all
to
do
*NL*
with
it
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
still
in
confidence
with
the
wall
.
`
If
only
*NL*
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
had
been
in
question
,
you
would
have
joined
*NL*
and
made
no
bones
about
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
yes
,
sir
.
'T
is
true
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Though
he
knows
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
now
blowing
a
gale
,
`
that
there
*NL*
are
a
set
of
rascals
and
rebels
whom
transportation
is
too
good
for
!
*NL*
Now
,
Mr.
Harthouse
,
you
have
been
knocking
about
in
the
world
some
time
.
*NL*
Did
you
ever
meet
with
anything
like
that
man
out
of
this
blessed
*NL*
country
?
'
And
Mr.
Bounderby
pointed
him
out
for
inspection
,
with
an
*NL*
angry
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Stephen
Blackpool
,
staunchly
protesting
against
the
*NL*
words
that
had
been
used
,
and
instinctively
addressing
himself
to
Louisa
,
*NL*
after
glancing
at
her
face
.
`
Not
rebels
,
nor
yet
rascals
.
Nowt
o
'
th
'
*NL*
kind
,
ma'am
,
nowt
o
'
th
'
kind

They
've
not
doon
me
a
kindness

ma'am
,
as
*NL*
I
know
and
feel
.
But
there
's
not
a
dozen
men
amoong
'em
,
ma'am
--
a
dozen
?
*NL*
Not
six
--
but
what
believes
as
he
has
doon
his
duty
by
the
rest
and
by
*NL*
himseln
.
God
forbid
as
I
,
that
ha

known
,
and
had

experience

doon

'
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
with
the
rugged
earnestness
of
his
place
and
character
--
deepened
*NL*
perhaps
by
a
proud
consciousness
that
he
was
faithful
to
his
class
under
*NL*
all
their
mistrust
;
but
he
fully
remembered
where
he
was
,
and
did
not
*NL*
even
raise
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
ma'am
,
no
.
They
're

another

to

They
'd
*NL*
be
riven
to
bits
,
ere
ever
they
'd
be
different
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
short
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
it
's
because
they
are
so
full
of
virtues
*NL*
that
they
have
turned
you
adrift
.
Go
through
with
it
while
you
are
about
*NL*
it
.
Out
with
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
't
is
,
ma'am
,
'
resumed
Stephen
,
appearing
still
to
find
his
natural
*NL*
refuge
in
Louisa
's
face
,
`
that
what
is
best
in
us
fok
,
seems
to
turn
us
*NL*
most
to
trouble
an
'
misfort
'n
an

mistake
,
I
dunno
.
But
't
is
so
.
I
know

't
is

as
I

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
my
friend

'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
whom
he
could
not
have
exasperated
*NL*
more
,
quite
unconscious
of
it
though
he
was
,
than
by
seeming
to
appeal
to
*NL*
any
one
else
,
`
if
you
will
favour
me
with
your
attention
for
half
a
*NL*
minute
,
I
should
like
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
you

You
said
just
now
,
*NL*
that
you
had
nothing
to
tell
us
about
this
business

You
are
quite
sure
*NL*
of
that
before

go
any
further

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir

I
am
sure
on
`
t.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
's
a
gentleman
from
London
present
,
'
Mr.
Bounderby
made
a
backhanded
*NL*
point
at
Mr.
James
Harthouse
with
his
thumb
,
'
a
Parliament
gentleman
.
I
*NL*
should
like
him
to
hear
a
short
bit
of
dialogue
between
you
and
me
,
*NL*
instead
of
taking
the
substance
of
it
--
for
I
know
precious
well
,
*NL*
beforehand
,
what
it
will
be
;
nobody
knows
better
than
I
do

take
*NL*
notice
!

instead
of
receiving
it
on
trust
from
my
mouth
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
bent
his
head
to
the
gentleman
from
London
,
and
showed
a
rather
*NL*
more
troubled
mind
than
usual
.
He
turned
his
eyes
involuntarily
to
his
*NL*
former
refuge
,
but
at
a
look
from
that
quarter
-LRB-
expressive
though
*NL*
instantaneous
-RRB-
he
settled
them
on
Mr.
Bounderby
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
what
do
you
complain
of
?
'
asked
Mr.
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ha
'
not
coom
here

'
Stephen
reminded
him

`

*NL*
*NL*
`
What

'
repeated
Mr.
Bounderby
,
folding
his
arms
,
`
do
you
people
,
in
a
*NL*
general
way
,
complain
of

'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
looked
at
him
with
some
little
irresolution
for
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
then
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir

I

Mr.

`
I

something
towards

at

'
returned
Mr.

Bounderby
.
`
We
will
make
an

of
half
a

Slackbridges
.
We
'll

the

for

'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
gravely
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do

'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
by
this
time
blowing
a
*NL*
hurricane
,
`
because
we
will
,
I
tell
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
returned
Stephen
,
with
the
quiet
confidence
of
absolute
certainty
,
*NL*
`
if
yo
was
t
'
tak
a
hundred
Slackbridges
--
aw
as
there
is
,
and
aw
the

an
'
was
t

up

an

in
the
deepest

as
were
made
ere

to

yo

*NL*
leave

muddle
just
wheer
't

Mischeevous
strangers
!
'
said
Stephen
,
*NL*
with
an
anxious
smile
;
`
when
ha
we
not
heern
,
I
am
sure
,
sin
ever
we
can
*NL*
call
to
mind
,
o
'
th
'
mischeevous
strangers
!
'T
is
not
by
_
them
_
the
*NL*
trouble
's
made
,
sir
.
'T
is
not
wi
'
_
them
_
'
t
commences
.
I
ha
no
favour
*NL*
for
'em
--
I
ha
no
reason
to
favour
'em
--
but
't
is
hopeless
and
useless
to
*NL*
dream
o
'
takin
them
fro
their
trade
,
`
stead
o
'
takin
their
trade
fro
*NL*
them
!
Aw
that

now

in

heer
afore
I
coom

an
'
*NL*
will
be

Put
that
clock
aboard
a

an
'
pack
it
*NL*
off
to
Norfolk
Island
,
an
'
the
time
will
go
on
just
the

.
So
't
is
*NL*
wi
'
Slackbridge
every
bit
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Reverting
for
a
moment
to
his
former
refuge
,
he
observed
a
cautionary
*NL*
movement
of
her
eyes
towards
the
door
.
Stepping
back
,
he
put
his
hand
*NL*
upon
the
lock
.
But
he
had
not
spoken
out
of
his
own
will
and
desire
;
and
*NL*
he
felt
it
in
his
heart
a
noble
return
for
his
late
injurious
treatment
*NL*
to
be
faithful
to
the
last
to
those
who
had
repudiated
him
.
He
stayed
to
*NL*
finish
what
was
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir

I

*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
stood
with
the
open
door
in
his
hand
,
waiting
to
know
if
anything
*NL*
more
were
expected
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Just
stop
a
moment
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
excessively
red
in
the
face
.
*NL*
'
I
told
you
,
the
last
time
you
were
here
with
a
grievance
,
that
you
had
*NL*
better
turn
about

come
out

And
I
also
told

I
do

.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
it
's
clear
to

'
said
Mr.

,
`
that
you
are
one
of
those
*NL*
chaps
who
have
always
got
a
grievance
.
And
you
go
about
,
sowing
it
and
*NL*
raising
crops
.
That
's
the
business
of
_
your
_
life
,
my
friend

'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
shook
his
head
,
mutely
protesting
that
indeed
he
had
other
*NL*
business
to
do
for
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
such
a
waspish
,
raspish
,
ill-conditioned
chap

you
see

said
*NL*
Mr.

`
that
even
your

will

have
nothing

I
never
thought

fellows
could
be
*NL*
right
in
anything
;
but
I
tell
you
what
!
I
so
far
go
along

*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
raised
his
eyes
quickly
to
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
can
finish
off
what
you
're
at

'
said
Mr.

,
with
a
meaning
*NL*
nod
,
`
and
then
go
elsewhere

*NL*
*NL*

expressively

The

was

I

have

*NL*
Stephen
glanced
at
Louisa
again
,
but
her
eyes
were
raised
to
his
no
more
;
*NL*
therefore
,
with
a
sigh
,
and
saying
,
barely
above
his
breath
,

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
FADING
AWAY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
falling
dark
when
Stephen
came
out
of
Mr.
Bounderby
's
house
.
The
*NL*
shadows
of
night
had
gathered
so
fast
,
that
he
did
not
look
about
him
*NL*
when
he
closed
the
door
,
but
plodded
straight
along
the
street
.
Nothing
*NL*
was
further
from
his
thoughts
than
the
curious
old
woman
he
had
*NL*
encountered
on
his
previous
visit
to
the
same
house
,
when
he
heard
a
step
*NL*
behind
him
that
he
knew
,
and
turning
,
saw
her
in
Rachael
's
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
Rachael
first
,
as
he
had
heard
her
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
Rachael
,
my
dear
!
Missus
,
thou
wi
'
her
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
and
now
you
are
surprised
to
be
sure
,
and
with
reason
I
must
say
,
'
*NL*
the
old
woman
returned
.
`
Here
I
am
again
,
you
see
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
how
wi
'
Rachael
?
'
said
Stephen
,
falling
into
their
step
,
walking
*NL*
between
them
,
and
looking
from
the
one
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
come
to
be
with
this
good
lass
pretty
much
as
I
came
to
be
with
*NL*
you
,
'
said
the
old
woman
,
cheerfully
,
taking
the
reply
upon
herself
.
`
My
*NL*
visiting
time
is
later
this
year
than
usual
,
for
I
have
been
rather
*NL*
troubled
with
shortness
of
breath
,
and
so
put
it
off
till
the
weather
was
*NL*
fine
and
warm
.
For
the
same
reason
I
do
n't
make
all
my
journey
in
one
*NL*
day
,
but
divide
it
into
two
days
,
and
get
a
bed
to-night
at
the
*NL*
Travellers
'
Coffee
House
down
by
the
railroad
-LRB-
a
nice
clean
house
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
go
back
Parliamentary
,
at
six
in
the
morning
.
Well
,
but
what
has
this
to
*NL*
do
with
this
good
lass
,
says
you
?
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
.
I
have
heard
*NL*
of
Mr.
Bounderby
being
married
.
I
read
it
in
the
paper
,
where
it
looked
*NL*
grand
--
oh
,
it
looked
fine
!
'
the
old
woman
dwelt
on
it
with
strange
*NL*
enthusiasm
:
`
and
I
want
to
see
his
wife
.
I
have
never
seen
her
yet
.
*NL*
Now
,
if
you
'll
believe
me
,
she
has
n't
come
out
of
that
house
since
noon
*NL*
to-day
.
So
not
to
give
her
up
too
easily
,
I
was
waiting
about
,
a
little
*NL*
last
bit
more
,
when
I
passed
close
to
this
good
lass
two
or
three
times
;
*NL*
and
her
face
being
so
friendly
I
spoke
to
her
,
and
she
spoke
to
me
.
*NL*
There
!
'
said
the
old
woman
to
Stephen
,
`
you
can
make
all
the
rest
out
for
*NL*
yourself
now
,
a
deal
shorter
than
I
can
,
I
dare
say
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Once
again
,
Stephen
had
to
conquer
an
instinctive
propensity
to
dislike
*NL*
this
old
woman
,
though
her
manner
was
as
honest
and
simple
as
a
manner
*NL*
possibly
could
be
.
With
a
gentleness
that
was
as
natural
to
him
as
he
*NL*
knew
it
to
be
to
Rachael
,
he
pursued
the
subject
that
interested
her
in
*NL*
her
old
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
missus
,
'
said
he
,
'
I
ha
seen
the
lady
,
and
she
were
young
and
*NL*
hansom
.
Wi
'
fine
dark
thinkin
eyes
,
and
a
still
way
,
Rachael
,
as
I
ha
*NL*
never
seen
the
like
on
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Young
and
handsome
.
Yes
!
'
cried
the
old
woman
,
quite
delighted
.
`
As
*NL*
bonny
as
a
rose
!
And
what
a
happy
wife
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aye
,
missus
,
I
suppose
she
be
,
'
said
Stephen
.
But
with
a
doubtful
*NL*
glance
at
Rachael
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suppose
she
be
?
She
must
be
.
She
's
your
master
's
wife
,
'
returned
the
*NL*
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
nodded
assent
.
`
Though
as
to
master
,
'
said
he
,
glancing
again
at
*NL*
Rachael
,
`
not
master
onny
more
.
That
's
aw
enden
`
twixt
him
and
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
left
his
work
,
Stephen
?
'
asked
Rachael
,
anxiously
and
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
Rachael
,
'
he
replied
,
`
whether
I
ha
lef
'n
his
work
,
or
whether
his
*NL*
work
ha
lef
'n
me
,
cooms
t
'
th
'
same
.
His
work
and
me
are
parted
.
'T
is
*NL*
as
weel
so
--
better
,
I
were
thinkin
when
yo
coom
up
wi
'
me
.
It
would
ha
*NL*
brought
'n
trouble
upon
trouble
if
I
had
stayed
theer
.
Haply
't
is
a
*NL*
kindness
to
monny
that
I
go
;
haply
't
is
a
kindness
to
myseln
;
anyways
it
*NL*
mun
be
done
.
I
mun
turn
my
face
fro
Coketown
fur
th
'
time
,
and
seek
a
*NL*
fort
`
n
,
dear
,
by
beginnin
fresh
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
will
you
go
,
Stephen
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
donno
t
`
night
,
'
said
he
,
lifting
off
his
hat
,
and
smoothing
his
thin
*NL*
hair
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
.
`
But
I
'm
not
goin
t
`
night
,
Rachael
,
nor
*NL*
yet
t
`
morrow
.
`
Ta
n't
easy
overmuch
t
'
know
wheer
t
'
turn
,
but
a
good
*NL*
heart
will
coom
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Herein
,
too
,
the
sense
of
even
thinking
unselfishly
aided
him
.
Before
he
*NL*
had
so
much
as
closed
Mr.
Bounderby
's
door
,
he
had
reflected
that
at
*NL*
least
his
being
obliged
to
go
away
was
good
for
her
,
as
it
would
save
her
*NL*
from
the
chance
of
being
brought
into
question
for
not
withdrawing
from
*NL*
him
.
Though
it
would
cost
him
a
hard
pang
to
leave
her
,
and
though
he
*NL*
could
think
of
no
similar
place
in
which
his
condemnation
would
not
*NL*
pursue
him
,
perhaps
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
be
forced
away
from
the
*NL*
endurance
of
the
last
four
days
,
even
to
unknown
difficulties
and
*NL*
distresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
said
,
with
truth
,
`
I
'm
more
leetsome
,
Rachael
,
under
`
t
,
than
I
*NL*
could
'n
ha
believed
.
'
It
was
not
her
part
to
make
his
burden
heavier
.
*NL*
She
answered
with
her
comforting
smile
,
and
the
three
walked
on
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Age
,
especially
when
it
strives
to
be
self-reliant
and
cheerful
,
finds
*NL*
much
consideration
among
the
poor
.
The
old
woman
was
so
decent
and
*NL*
contented
,
and
made
so
light
of
her
infirmities
,
though
they
had
*NL*
increased
upon
her
since
her
former
interview
with
Stephen
,
that
they
*NL*
both
took
an
interest
in
her
.
She
was
too
sprightly
to
allow
of
their
*NL*
walking
at
a
slow
pace
on
her
account
,
but
she
was
very
grateful
to
be
*NL*
talked
to
,
and
very
willing
to
talk
to
any
extent
:
so
,
when
they
came
to
*NL*
their
part
of
the
town
,
she
was
more
brisk
and
vivacious
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
to
my
poor
place
,
missus
,
'
said
Stephen
,
`
and
tak
a
coop
o
'
tea
.
*NL*
Rachael
will
coom
then
;
and
arterwards
I
'll
see
thee
safe
t
'
thy
*NL*
Travellers
'
lodgin
.
'
T
may
be
long
,
Rachael
,
ere
ever
I
ha
th
'
chance
o
'
*NL*
thy
coompany
agen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
complied
,
and
the
three
went
on
to
the
house
where
he
lodged
.
When
*NL*
they
turned
into
a
narrow
street
,
Stephen
glanced
at
his
window
with
a
*NL*
dread
that
always
haunted
his
desolate
home
;
but
it
was
open
,
as
he
had
*NL*
left
it
,
and
no
one
was
there
.
The
evil
spirit
of
his
life
had
flitted
*NL*
away
again
,
months
ago
,
and
he
had
heard
no
more
of
her
since
.
The
only
*NL*
evidence
of
her
last
return
now
,
were
the
scantier
moveables
in
his
room
,
*NL*
and
the
grayer
hair
upon
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lighted
a
candle
,
set
out
his
little
tea-board
,
got
hot
water
from
*NL*
below
,
and
brought
in
small
portions
of
tea
and
sugar
,
a
loaf
,
and
some
*NL*
butter
from
the
nearest
shop
.
The
bread
was
new
and
crusty
,
the
butter
*NL*
fresh
,
and
the
sugar
lump
,
of
course
--
in
fulfilment
of
the
standard
*NL*
testimony
of
the
Coketown
magnates
,
that
these
people
lived
like
princes
,
*NL*
sir
.
Rachael
made
the
tea
-LRB-
so
large
a
party
necessitated
the
borrowing
*NL*
of
a
cup
-RRB-
,
and
the
visitor
enjoyed
it
mightily
.
It
was
the
first
glimpse
*NL*
of
sociality
the
host
had
had
for
many
days
.
He
too
,
with
the
world
a
*NL*
wide
heath
before
him
,
enjoyed
the
meal
--
again
in
corroboration
of
the
*NL*
magnates
,
as
exemplifying
the
utter
want
of
calculation
on
the
part
of
*NL*
these
people
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ha
never

'
said
Stephen
,
`
o
'
askin

'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
announced
herself
as
`
Mrs.
Pegler
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
widder
,
I
think
?
'
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
many
long
years
!
'
Mrs.
Pegler
's
husband
-LRB-
one
of
the
best
on
record
-RRB-
*NL*
was
already
dead
,
by
Mrs.
Pegler
's
calculation
,
when
Stephen
was
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
Twere
a
bad
job
,
too
,
to

'
said
Stephen
.
`
Onny
*NL*
children
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pegler
's
cup
,
rattling
against
her
saucer
as
she
held
it
,
denoted
*NL*
some
nervousness
on
her
part
.
`
No
,
'
she
said
.
`
Not
now
,
not
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dead

Stephen

Rachael
softly
hinted

Stephen
,

I

'
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
excused
himself
,
the
old
lady
's
cup
rattled
more
and
more
.
'
I
*NL*
had
a
son
,
'
she
said
,
curiously
distressed
,
and
not
by
any
of
the
usual
*NL*
appearances
of
sorrow
;
`
and
he
did
well
,
wonderfully
well
.
But
he
is
not
*NL*
to
be
spoken
of
if
you
please
.
He
is
--
'
Putting
down
her
cup
,
she
moved
*NL*
her
hands
as
if
she
would
have
added
,
by
her
action
,
`
dead
!
'
Then
she
*NL*
said
aloud
,
'
I
have
lost
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
had
not
yet
got
the
better
of
his
having
given
the
old
lady
pain
,
*NL*
when
his
landlady
came
stumbling
up
the
narrow
stairs
,
and
calling
him
to
*NL*
the
door
,
whispered
in
his
ear
.
Mrs.
Pegler
was
by
no
means
deaf
,
for
*NL*
she
caught
a
word
as
it
was
uttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bounderby
!
'
she
cried
,
in
a
suppressed
voice
,
starting
up
from
the
*NL*
table
.
`
Oh
hide
me
!
Do
n't
let
me
be
seen
for
the
world
.
Do
n't
let
him
*NL*
come
up
till
I
've
got
away
.
Pray
,
pray
!
'
She
trembled
,
and
was
*NL*
excessively
agitated
;
getting
behind
Rachael
,
when
Rachael
tried
to
*NL*
reassure
her
;
and
not
seeming
to
know
what
she
was
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
hearken
,
missus
,
hearken
,
'
said
Stephen
,
astonished
.
''
Tis

Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby

't
is
his

Yo

Yo
was
hey-go-mad
*NL*
about

but
an

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
are
you
sure
it
's
the
lady
,
and
not
the
gentleman
?
'
she
asked
,
still
*NL*
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certain
sure
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
then
,
pray
do
n't
speak
to
me
,
nor
yet
take
any
notice
of
me
,
'
said
*NL*
the
old
woman
.
`
Let
me
be
quite
to
myself
in
this
corner
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
nodded
;
looking
to
Rachael
for
an
explanation
,
which
she
was
*NL*
quite
unable
to
give
him
;
took
the
candle
,
went
downstairs
,
and
in
a
few
*NL*
moments
returned
,
lighting
Louisa
into
the
room
.
She
was
followed
by
the
*NL*
whelp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rachael
had
risen
,
and
stood
apart
with
her
shawl
and
bonnet
in
her
hand
,
*NL*
when
Stephen
,
himself
profoundly
astonished
by
this
visit
,
put
the
candle
*NL*
on
the
table
.
Then
he
too
stood
,
with
his
doubled
hand
upon
the
table
*NL*
near
it
,
waiting
to
be
addressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
Louisa
had
come
into
one
of
the
dwellings
*NL*
of
the
Coketown
Hands
;
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
face
to
*NL*
face
with
anything
like
individuality
in
connection
with
them
.
She
knew
*NL*
of
their
existence
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
.
She
knew
what
results
*NL*
in
work
a
given
number
of
them
would
produce
in
a
given
space
of
time
.
*NL*
She
knew
them
in
crowds
passing
to
and
from
their
nests
,
like
ants
or
*NL*
beetles
.
But
she
knew
from
her
reading
infinitely
more
of
the
ways
of
*NL*
toiling
insects
than
of
these
toiling
men
and
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
to
be
worked
so
much
and
paid
so
much
,
and
there
ended
;
*NL*
something
to
be
infallibly
settled
by
laws
of
supply
and
demand
;
*NL*
something
that
blundered
against
those
laws
,
and
floundered
into
*NL*
difficulty
;
something
that
was
a
little
pinched
when
wheat
was
dear
,
and
*NL*
over-ate
itself
when
wheat
was
cheap
;
something
that
increased
at
such
a
*NL*
rate
of
percentage
,
and
yielded
such
another
percentage
of
crime
,
and
*NL*
such
another
percentage
of
pauperism
;
something
wholesale
,
of
which
vast
*NL*
fortunes
were
made
;
something
that
occasionally
rose
like
a
sea
,
and
did
*NL*
some
harm
and
waste
-LRB-
chiefly
to
itself
-RRB-
,
and
fell
again
;
this
she
knew
*NL*
the
Coketown
Hands
to
be
.
But
,
she
had
scarcely
thought
more
of
*NL*
separating
them
into
units
,
than
of
separating
the
sea
itself
into
its
*NL*
component
drops
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
for
some
moments
looking
round
the
room
.
From
the
few
chairs
,
*NL*
the
few
books
,
the
common
prints
,
and
the
bed
,
she
glanced
to
the
two
*NL*
women
,
and
to
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
come
to
speak
to
you
,
in
consequence
of
what
passed
just
now
.
I
*NL*
should
like
to
be
serviceable
to
you
,
if
you
will
let
me
.
Is
this
your
*NL*
wife
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Rachael
raised
her
eyes
,
and
they
sufficiently
answered
no
,
and
dropped
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
remember
,
'
said
Louisa
,
reddening
at
her
mistake
;
'
I
recollect
,
now
,
*NL*
to
have
heard
your
domestic
misfortunes
spoken
of
,
though
I
was
not
*NL*
attending
to
the
particulars
at
the
time
.
It
was
not
my
meaning
to
ask
a
*NL*
question
that
would
give
pain
to
any
one
here
.
If
I
should
ask
any
other
*NL*
question
that
may
happen
to
have
that
result
,
give
me
credit
,
if
you
*NL*
please
,
for
being
in
ignorance
how
to
speak
to
you
as
I
ought
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
Stephen
had
but
a
little
while
ago
instinctively
addressed
himself
to
*NL*
her
,
so
she
now
instinctively
addressed
herself
to
Rachael
.
Her
manner
*NL*
was
short
and
abrupt
,
yet
faltering
and
timid
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
has
told
you
what
has
passed
between
himself
and
my
husband
?
You
*NL*
would
be
his
first
resource
,
I
think
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
heard
the
end
of
it
,
young
lady
,
'
said
Rachael
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
I
understand
,
that
,
being
rejected
by
one
employer
,
he
would
*NL*
probably
be
rejected
by
all
?
I
thought
he
said
as
much
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
chances
are
very
small
,
young
lady
--
next
to
nothing
--
for
a
man
who
*NL*
gets
a
bad
name
among
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
shall
I
understand
that
you
mean
by
a
bad
name
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
name
of
being
troublesome
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
by
the
prejudices
of
his
own
class
,
and
by
the
prejudices
of
the
*NL*
other
,
he
is
sacrificed
alike
?
Are
the
two
so
deeply
separated
in
this
*NL*
town
,
that
there
is
no
place
whatever
for
an
honest
workman
between
*NL*
them
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Rachael
shook
her
head
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
fell
into
suspicion
,
'
said
Louisa
,
`
with
his
fellow-weavers
,
*NL*
because
--
he
had
made
a
promise
not
to
be
one
of
them
.
I
think
it
must
*NL*
have
been
to
you
that
he
made
that
promise
.
Might
I
ask
you
why
he
made
*NL*
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Rachael
burst
into
tears
.
'
I
did
n't
seek
it
of
him
,
poor
lad
.
I
prayed
*NL*
him
to
avoid
trouble
for
his
own
good
,
little
thinking
he
'd
come
to
it
*NL*
through
me
.
But
I
know
he
'd
die
a
hundred
deaths
,
ere
ever
he
'd
break
*NL*
his
word
.
I
know
that
of
him
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
had
remained
quietly
attentive
,
in
his
usual
thoughtful
attitude
,
*NL*
with
his
hand
at
his
chin
.
He
now
spoke
in
a
voice
rather
less
steady
*NL*
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
one
,
excepting
myseln
,
can
ever
know
what
honour
,
an
'
what
love
,
an
'
*NL*
respect
,
I
bear
to
Rachael
,
or
wi
'
what
cause
.
When
I
passed
that
*NL*
promess
,
I
towd
her
true

she
were

Angel
o

my

'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
turned
her
head
to
him
,
and
bent
it
with
a
deference
that
was
new
*NL*
in
her
.
She
looked
from
him
to
Rachael
,
and
her
features
softened
.
*NL*
`
What
will
you
do
?
'
she
asked
him
.
And
her
voice
had
softened
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Weel
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Stephen
,
making
the
best
of
it
,
with
a
smile
;
`
when
I
*NL*
ha
finished
off
,
I
mun
quit
this
part

'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
coloured
,
and
a
purse
appeared
in
her
hand
.
The
rustling
of
a
*NL*
bank-note
was
audible
,
as
she
unfolded
one
and
laid
it
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rachael
,
will
you
tell
him
--

you
know
how

without

that

is

*NL*
*NL*
'
I

answered
,
turning
her
head
aside
.
*NL*
`

'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
looked
,
in
part
incredulous
,
in
part
frightened
,
in
part
overcome
*NL*
with
quick
sympathy
,
when
this
man
of
so
much
self-command
,
who
had
been
*NL*
so
plain
and
steady
through
the
late
interview
,
lost
his
composure
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
now
stood
with
his
hand
before
his
face
.
She
stretched
out
*NL*
hers
,
as
if
she
would
have
touched
him
;
then
checked
herself
,
and
*NL*
remained
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not

Stephen
,
when
he
stood
again

I

not

wi'out
reason
and

I
'll
tak
two
pound
.
*NL*
I
'll
borrow

for

back
.
`
Twill
be
the
sweetest
work
as
ever
I
*NL*
ha
done
,
that
puts
it
in
my
power
t
'
acknowledge
once
more
my
lastin
*NL*
thankfulness
for
this
present
action
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
fain
to
take
up
the
note
again
,
and
to
substitute
the
much
*NL*
smaller
sum
he
had
named
.
He
was
neither
courtly
,
nor
handsome
,
nor
*NL*
picturesque
,
in
any
respect
;
and
yet
his
manner
of
accepting
it
,
and
of
*NL*
expressing
his
thanks
without
more
words
,
had
a
grace
in
it
that
Lord
*NL*
Chesterfield
could
not
have
taught
his
son
in
a
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
sat
upon
the
bed
,
swinging
one
leg
and
sucking
his
walking-stick
*NL*
with
sufficient
unconcern
,
until
the
visit
had
attained
this
stage
.
*NL*
Seeing
his
sister
ready
to
depart
,
he
got
up
,
rather
hurriedly
,
and
put
*NL*
in
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Just
wait
a
moment
,
Loo
!
Before
we
go
,
I
should
like
to
speak
to
him
a
*NL*
moment
.
Something
comes
into
my
head
.
If
you
'll
step
out
on
the
stairs
,
*NL*
Blackpool
,
I
'll
mention
it
.
Never
mind
a
light
,
man
!
'
Tom
was
*NL*
remarkably
impatient
of
his
moving
towards
the
cupboard
,
to
get
one
.
`
It
*NL*
do
n't
want
a
light
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
followed
him
out
,
and
Tom
closed
the
room
door
,
and
held
the
lock
*NL*
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
!
'
he
whispered
.
'
I
think
I
can
do
you
a
good
turn
.
Do
n't
ask
me
*NL*
what
it
is
,
because
it
may
not
come
to
anything
.
But
there
's
no
harm
in
*NL*
my
trying
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
His
breath
fell
like
a
flame
of
fire
on
Stephen
's
ear
,
it
was
so
hot
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
was
our
light
porter
at
the
Bank
,
'
said
Tom
,
`
who
brought
you
the
*NL*
message
to-night
.
I
call
him
our
light
porter
,
because
I
belong
to
the
*NL*
Bank
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
thought
,
`
What
a
hurry
he
is
in
!
'
He
spoke
so
confusedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
said
Tom
.
`
Now
look
here
!
When
are
you
off
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
T
'
day
's
Monday
,
'
replied
Stephen
,
considering
.
`
Why
,
sir
,
Friday
or
*NL*
Saturday
,
nigh
`
bout
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Friday
or
Saturday
,
'
said
Tom
.
`
Now
look
here
!
I
am
not
sure
that
I
*NL*
can
do
you
the
good
turn
I
want
to
do
you
--
that
's
my
sister
,
you
know
,
in
*NL*
your
room
--
but
I
may
be
able
to
,
and
if
I
should
not
be
able
to
,
there
's
*NL*
no
harm
done
.
So
I
tell
you
what
.
You
'll
know
our
light
porter
again
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sure
,
'
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
well
,
'
returned
Tom
.
`
When
you
leave
work
of
a
night
,
between
this
*NL*
and
your
going
away
,
just
hang
about
the
Bank
an
hour
or
so
,
will
you
?
*NL*
Do
n't
take
on
,
as
if
you
meant
anything
,
if
he
should
see
you
hanging
*NL*
about
there
;
because
I
sha
n't
put
him
up
to
speak
to
you
,
unless
I
find
I
*NL*
can
do
you
the
service
I
want
to
do
you
.
In
that
case
he
'll
have
a
note
*NL*
or
a
message
for
you
,
but
not
else
.
Now
look
here
!
You
are
sure
you
*NL*
understand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
wormed
a
finger
,
in
the
darkness
,
through
a
button-hole
of
*NL*
Stephen
's
coat
,
and
was
screwing
that
corner
of
the
garment
tight
up
*NL*
round
and
round
,
in
an
extraordinary
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
understand
,
sir
,
'
said
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
look
here
!
'
repeated
Tom
.
`
Be
sure
you
do
n't
make
any
mistake
then
,
*NL*
and
do
n't
forget
.
I
shall
tell
my
sister
as
we
go
home
,
what
I
have
in
*NL*
view
,
and
she
'll
approve
,
I
know
.
Now
look
here
!
You
're
all
right
,
are
*NL*
you
?
You
understand
all
about
it
?
Very
well
then
.
Come
along
,
Loo
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
pushed
the
door
open
as
he
called
to
her
,
but
did
not
return
into
the
*NL*
room
,
or
wait
to
be
lighted
down
the
narrow
stairs
.
He
was
at
the
bottom
*NL*
when
she
began
to
descend
,
and
was
in
the
street
before
she
could
take
*NL*
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pegler
remained
in
her
corner
until
the
brother
and
sister
were
*NL*
gone
,
and
until
Stephen
came
back
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
.
She
was
*NL*
in
a
state
of
inexpressible
admiration
of
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
and
,
like
an
*NL*
unaccountable
old
woman
,
wept
,
`
because
she
was
such
a
pretty
dear
.
'
Yet
*NL*
Mrs.
Pegler
was
so
flurried
lest
the
object
of
her
admiration
should
*NL*
return
by
chance
,
or
anybody
else
should
come
,
that
her
cheerfulness
was
*NL*
ended
for
that
night
.
It
was
late
too
,
to
people
who
rose
early
and
*NL*
worked
hard
;
therefore
the
party
broke
up
;
and
Stephen
and
Rachael
*NL*
escorted
their
mysterious
acquaintance
to
the
door
of
the
Travellers
'
*NL*
Coffee
House
,
where
they
parted
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
back
together
to
the
corner
of
the
street
where
Rachael
*NL*
lived
,
and
as
they
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
it
,
silence
crept
upon
them
.
*NL*
When
they
came
to
the
dark
corner
where
their
unfrequent
meetings
always
*NL*
ended
,
they
stopped
,
still
silent
,
as
if
both
were
afraid
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
strive
t
'
see
thee
agen
,
Rachael
,
afore
I
go
,
but
if

--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thou

'T

*NL*
*NL*

I

thee

said
Stephen
Blackpool
--
`
that
night
--
that
I
would
*NL*
never

o

onnything
that
angered

'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
but
a
hurried
parting
in
a
common
street
,
yet
it
was
a
sacred
*NL*
remembrance
to
these
two
common
people
.
Utilitarian
economists
,
*NL*
skeletons
of
schoolmasters
,
Commissioners
of
Fact
,
genteel
and
used-up
*NL*
infidels
,
gabblers
of
many
little
dog
's
-
eared
creeds
,
the
poor
you
will
*NL*
have
always
with
you
.
Cultivate
in
them
,
while
there
is
yet
time
,
the
*NL*
utmost
graces
of
the
fancies
and
affections
,
to
adorn
their
lives
so
much
*NL*
in
need
of
ornament
;
or
,
in
the
day
of
your
triumph
,
when
romance
is
*NL*
utterly
driven
out
of
their
souls
,
and
they
and
a
bare
existence
stand
*NL*
face
to
face
,
Reality
will
take
a
wolfish
turn
,
and
make
an
end
of
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
worked
the
next
day
,
and
the
next
,
uncheered
by
a
word
from
any
*NL*
one
,
and
shunned
in
all
his
comings
and
goings
as
before
.
At
the
end
of
*NL*
the
second
day
,
he
saw
land
;
at
the
end
of
the
third
,
his
loom
stood
*NL*
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
overstayed
his
hour
in
the
street
outside
the
Bank
,
on
each
of
the
*NL*
two
first
evenings
;
and
nothing
had
happened
there
,
good
or
bad
.
That
he
*NL*
might
not
be
remiss
in
his
part
of
the
engagement
,
he
resolved
to
wait
*NL*
full
two
hours
,
on
this
third
and
last
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
lady
who
had
once
kept
Mr.
Bounderby
's
house
,
sitting
at
*NL*
the
first-floor
window
as
he
had
seen
her
before
;
and
there
was
the
light
*NL*
porter
,
sometimes
talking
with
her
there
,
and
sometimes
looking
over
the
*NL*
blind
below
which
had
BANK
upon
it
,
and
sometimes
coming
to
the
door
and
*NL*
standing
on
the
steps
for
a
breath
of
air
.
When
he
first
came
out
,
*NL*
Stephen
thought
he
might
be
looking
for
him
,
and
passed
near
;
but
the
*NL*
light
porter
only
cast
his
winking
eyes
upon
him
slightly
,
and
said
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
were
a
long
stretch
of
lounging
about
,
after
a
long
day
's
*NL*
labour
.
Stephen
sat
upon
the
step
of
a
door
,
leaned
against
a
wall
under
*NL*
an
archway
,
strolled
up
and
down
,
listened
for
the
church
clock
,
stopped
*NL*
and
watched
children
playing
in
the
street
.
Some
purpose
or
other
is
so
*NL*
natural
to
every
one
,
that
a
mere
loiterer
always
looks
and
feels
*NL*
remarkable
.
When
the
first
hour
was
out
,
Stephen
even
began
to
have
an
*NL*
uncomfortable
sensation
upon
him
of
being
for
the
time
a
disreputable
*NL*
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
lamplighter
,
and
two
lengthening
lines
of
light
all
down
*NL*
the
long
perspective
of
the
street
,
until
they
were
blended
and
lost
in
*NL*
the
distance
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
closed
the
first-floor
window
,
drew
down
the
*NL*
blind
,
and
went
up-stairs
.
Presently
,
a
light
went
up-stairs
after
her
,
*NL*
passing
first
the
fanlight
of
the
door
,
and
afterwards
the
two
staircase
*NL*
windows
,
on
its
way
up
.
By
and
by
,
one
corner
of
the
second-floor
blind
*NL*
was
disturbed
,
as
if
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
eye
were
there
;
also
the
other
*NL*
corner
,
as
if
the
light
porter
's
eye
were
on
that
side
.
Still
,
no
*NL*
communication
was
made
to
Stephen
.
Much
relieved
when
the
two
hours
were
*NL*
at
last
accomplished
,
he
went
away
at
a
quick
pace
,
as
a
recompense
for
*NL*
so
much
loitering
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
only
to
take
leave
of
his
landlady
,
and
lie
down
on
his
temporary
*NL*
bed
upon
the
floor
;
for
his
bundle
was
made
up
for
to-morrow
,
and
all
was
*NL*
arranged
for
his
departure
.
He
meant
to
be
clear
of
the
town
very
early
;
*NL*
before
the
Hands
were
in
the
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
barely
daybreak
,
when
,
with
a
parting
look
round
his
room
,
*NL*
mournfully
wondering
whether
he
should
ever
see
it
again
,
he
went
out
.
*NL*
The
town
was
as
entirely
deserted
as
if
the
inhabitants
had
abandoned
it
,
*NL*
rather
than
hold
communication
with
him
.
Everything
looked
wan
at
that
*NL*
hour
.
Even
the
coming
sun
made
but
a
pale
waste
in
the
sky
,
like
a
sad
*NL*
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
place
where
Rachael
lived
,
though
it
was
not
in
his
way
;
by
the
*NL*
red
brick
streets
;
by
the
great
silent
factories
,
not
trembling
yet
;
by
*NL*
the
railway
,
where
the
danger-lights
were
waning
in
the
strengthening
*NL*
day
;
by
the
railway
's
crazy
neighbourhood
,
half
pulled
down
and
half
*NL*
built
up
;
by
scattered
red
brick
villas
,
where
the
besmoked
evergreens
*NL*
were
sprinkled
with
a
dirty
powder
,
like
untidy
snuff-takers
;
by
*NL*
coal-dust
paths
and
many
varieties
of
ugliness
;
Stephen
got
to
the
top
of
*NL*
the
hill
,
and
looked
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
was
shining
radiantly
upon
the
town
then
,
and
the
bells
were
going
*NL*
for
the
morning
work
.
Domestic
fires
were
not
yet
lighted
,
and
the
high
*NL*
chimneys
had
the
sky
to
themselves
.
Puffing
out
their
poisonous
volumes
,
*NL*
they
would
not
be
long
in
hiding
it
;
but
,
for
half
an
hour
,
some
of
the
*NL*
many
windows
were
golden
,
which
showed
the
Coketown
people
a
sun
*NL*
eternally
in
eclipse
,
through
a
medium
of
smoked
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
strange
to
turn
from
the
chimneys
to
the
birds
.
So
strange
,
to
have
*NL*
the
road-dust
on
his
feet
instead
of
the
coal-grit
.
So
strange
to
have
*NL*
lived
to
his
time
of
life
,
and
yet
to
be
beginning
like
a
boy
this
summer
*NL*
morning
!
With
these
musings
in
his
mind
,
and
his
bundle
under
his
arm
,
*NL*
Stephen
took
his
attentive
face
along
the
high
road
.
And
the
trees
*NL*
arched
over
him
,
whispering
that
he
left
a
true
and
loving
heart
behind
.

party
,
soon
began
to
*NL*
score
.
With
the
aid
of
a
little
more
coaching
for
the
political
sages
,
a
*NL*
little
more
genteel
listlessness
for
the
general
society
,
and
a
tolerable
*NL*
management
of
the
assumed
honesty
in
dishonesty
,
most
effective
and
most
*NL*
patronized
of
the
polite
deadly
sins
,
he
speedily
came
to
be
considered
*NL*
of
much
promise
.
The
not
being
troubled
with
earnestness
was
a
grand
*NL*
point
in
his
favour
,
enabling
him
to
take
to
the
hard
Fact
fellows
with
*NL*
as
good
a
grace
as
if
he
had
been
born
one
of
the
tribe
,
and
to
throw
all
*NL*
other
tribes
overboard
,
as
conscious
hypocrites
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whom
none
of
us
believe
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
and
who
do
not
believe
*NL*
themselves
.
The
only
difference
between
us
and
the
professors
of
virtue
*NL*
or
benevolence
,
or
philanthropy
--
never
mind
the
name
--
is
,
that
we
know
it
*NL*
is
all
meaningless
,
and
say
so
;
while
they
know
it
equally
and
will
never
*NL*
say
so
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Why
should
she
be
shocked
or
warned
by
this
reiteration
?
It
was
not
so
*NL*
unlike
her
father
's
principles
,
and
her
early
training
,
that
it
need
*NL*
startle
her
.
Where
was
the
great
difference
between
the
two
schools
,
*NL*
when
each
chained
her
down
to
material
realities
,
and
inspired
her
with
*NL*
no
faith
in
anything
else
?
What
was
there
in
her
soul
for
James
*NL*
Harthouse
to
destroy
,
which
Thomas
Gradgrind
had
nurtured
there
in
its
*NL*
state
of
innocence
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
even
the
worse
for
her
at
this
pass
,
that
in
her
mind
--
implanted
*NL*
there
before
her
eminently
practical
father
began
to
form
it
--
a
struggling
*NL*
disposition
to
believe
in
a
wider
and
nobler
humanity
than
she
had
ever
*NL*
heard
of
,
constantly
strove
with
doubts
and
resentments
.
With
doubts
,
*NL*
because
the
aspiration
had
been
so
laid
waste
in
her
youth
.
With
*NL*
resentments
,
because
of
the
wrong
that
had
been
done
her
,
if
it
were
*NL*
indeed
a
whisper
of
the
truth
.
Upon
a
nature
long
accustomed
to
*NL*
self-suppression
,
thus
torn
and
divided
,
the
Harthouse
philosophy
came
as
*NL*
a
relief
and
justification
.
Everything
being
hollow
and
worthless
,
she
*NL*
had
missed
nothing
and
sacrificed
nothing
.
What
did
it
matter
,
she
had
*NL*
said
to
her
father
,
when
he
proposed
her
husband
.
What
did
it
matter
,
*NL*
she
said
still
.
With
a
scornful
self-reliance
,
she
asked
herself
,
What
*NL*
did
anything
matter
--
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
what
?
Step
by
step
,
onward
and
downward
,
towards
some
end
,
yet
*NL*
so
gradually
,
that
she
believed
herself
to
remain
motionless
.
As
to
Mr.
*NL*
Harthouse
,
whither
_
he
_
tended
,
he
neither
considered
nor
cared
.
He
had
*NL*
no
particular
design
or
plan
before
him
:
no
energetic
wickedness
ruffled
*NL*
his
lassitude
.
He
was
as
much
amused
and
interested
,
at
present
,
as
it
*NL*
became
so
fine
a
gentleman
to
be
;
perhaps
even
more
than
it
would
have
*NL*
been
consistent
with
his
reputation
to
confess
.
Soon
after
his
arrival
*NL*
he
languidly
wrote
to
his
brother
,
the
honourable
and
jocular
member
,
*NL*
that
the
Bounderbys
were
`
great
fun
;
'
and
further
,
that
the
female
*NL*
Bounderby
,
instead
of
being
the
Gorgon
he
had
expected
,
was
young
,
and
*NL*
remarkably
pretty
.
After
that
,
he
wrote
no
more
about
them
,
and
devoted
*NL*
his
leisure
chiefly
to
their
house
.
He
was
very
often
in
their
house
,
in
*NL*
his
flittings
and
visitings
about
the
Coketown
district
;
and
was
much
*NL*
encouraged
by
Mr.
Bounderby
.
It
was
quite
in
Mr.
Bounderby
's
gusty
way
*NL*
to
boast
to
all
his
world
that
_
he
_
did
n't
care
about
your
highly
*NL*
connected
people
,
but
that
if
his
wife
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
did
,
she
*NL*
was
welcome
to
their
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
James
Harthouse
began
to
think
it
would
be
a
new
sensation
,
if
the
*NL*
face
which
changed
so
beautifully
for
the
whelp
,
would
change
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
quick
enough
to
observe
;
he
had
a
good
memory
,
and
did
not
forget
*NL*
a
word
of
the
brother
's
revelations
.
He
interwove
them
with
everything
*NL*
he
saw
of
the
sister
,
and
he
began
to
understand
her
.
To
be
sure
,
the
*NL*
better
and
profounder
part
of
her
character
was
not
within
his
scope
of
*NL*
perception
;
for
in
natures
,
as
in
seas
,
depth
answers
unto
depth
;
but
he
*NL*
soon
began
to
read
the
rest
with
a
student
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
had
taken
possession
of
a
house
and
grounds
,
about
fifteen
*NL*
miles
from
the
town
,
and
accessible
within
a
mile
or
two
,
by
a
railway
*NL*
striding
on
many
arches
over
a
wild
country
,
undermined
by
deserted
*NL*
coal-shafts
,
and
spotted
at
night
by
fires
and
black
shapes
of
stationary
*NL*
engines
at
pits
'
mouths
.
This
country
,
gradually
softening
towards
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
Mr.
Bounderby
's
retreat
,
there
mellowed
into
a
rustic
*NL*
landscape
,
golden
with
heath
,
and
snowy
with
hawthorn
in
the
spring
of
*NL*
the
year
,
and
tremulous
with
leaves
and
their
shadows
all
the
summer
*NL*
time
.
The
bank
had
foreclosed
a
mortgage
effected
on
the
property
thus
*NL*
pleasantly
situated
,
by
one
of
the
Coketown
magnates
,
who
,
in
his
*NL*
determination
to
make
a
shorter
cut
than
usual
to
an
enormous
fortune
,
*NL*
overspeculated
himself
by
about
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
.
These
*NL*
accidents
did
sometimes
happen
in
the
best
regulated
families
of
*NL*
Coketown
,
but
the
bankrupts
had
no
connexion
whatever
with
the
*NL*
improvident
classes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
afforded
Mr.
Bounderby
supreme
satisfaction
to
instal
himself
in
this
*NL*
snug
little
estate
,
and
with
demonstrative
humility
to
grow
cabbages
in
*NL*
the
flower-garden
.
He
delighted
to
live
,
barrack-fashion
,
among
the
*NL*
elegant
furniture
,
and
he
bullied
the
very
pictures
with
his
origin
.
*NL*
`
Why
,
sir
,
'
he
would
say
to
a
visitor
,
'
I
am
told
that
Nickits
,
'
the
late
*NL*
owner
,
`
gave
seven
hundred
pound
for
that
Seabeach
.
Now
,
to
be
plain
*NL*
with
you
,
if
I
ever
,
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
,
take
seven
looks
at
*NL*
it
,
at
a
hundred
pound
a
look
,
it
will
be
as
much
as
I
shall
do
.
No
,
by
*NL*
George
!
I
do
n't
forget
that
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
.
For
*NL*
years
upon
years
,
the
only
pictures
in
my
possession
,
or
that
I
could
*NL*
have
got
into
my
possession
,
by
any
means
,
unless
I
stole
'em
,
were
the
*NL*
engravings
of
a
man
shaving
himself
in
a
boot
,
on
the
blacking
bottles
*NL*
that
I
was
overjoyed
to
use
in
cleaning
boots
with
,
and
that
I
sold
when
*NL*
they
were
empty
for
a
farthing
a-piece
,
and
glad
to
get
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
would
address
Mr.
Harthouse
in
the
same
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Harthouse
,
you
have
a
couple
of
horses
down
here
.
Bring
half
a
dozen
*NL*
more
if
you
like
,
and
we
'll
find
room
for
'em
.
There
's
stabling
in
this
*NL*
place
for
a
dozen
horses
;
and
unless
Nickits
is
belied
,
he
kept
the
full
*NL*
number
.
A
round
dozen
of
'em
,
sir
.
When
that
man
was
a
boy
,
he
went
to
*NL*
Westminster
School
.
Went
to
Westminster
School
as
a
King
's
Scholar
,
when
*NL*
I
was
principally
living
on
garbage
,
and
sleeping
in
market
baskets
.
*NL*
Why
,
if
I
wanted
to
keep
a
dozen
horses
--
which
I
do
n't
,
for
one
's
enough
*NL*
for
me
--
I
could
n't
bear
to
see
'em
in
their
stalls
here
,
and
think
what
my
*NL*
own
lodging
used
to
be
.
I
could
n't
look
at
'em
,
sir
,
and
not
order
'em
*NL*
out
.
Yet
so
things
come
round
.
You
see
this
place
;
you
know
what
sort
*NL*
of
a
place
it
is
;
you
are
aware
that
there
's
not
a
completer
place
of
its
*NL*
size
in
this
kingdom
or
elsewhere
--
I
do
n't
care
where
--
and
here
,
got
into
*NL*
the
middle
of
it
,
like
a
maggot
into
a
nut
,
is
Josiah
Bounderby
.
While
*NL*
Nickits
-LRB-
as
a
man
came
into
my
office
,
and
told
me
yesterday
-RRB-
,
Nickits
,
*NL*
who
used
to
act
in
Latin
,
in
the
Westminster
School
plays
,
with
the
*NL*
chief-justices
and
nobility
of
this
country
applauding
him
till
they
were
*NL*
black
in
the
face
,
is
drivelling
at
this
minute
--
drivelling
,
sir
!
--
in
a
*NL*
fifth
floor
,
up
a
narrow
dark
back
street
in
Antwerp
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
among
the
leafy
shadows
of
this
retirement
,
in
the
long
sultry
*NL*
summer
days
,
that
Mr.
Harthouse
began
to
prove
the
face
which
had
set
him
*NL*
wondering
when
he
first
saw
it
,
and
to
try
if
it
would
change
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
I
esteem
it
a
most
fortunate
accident
that
I
find
you
*NL*
alone
here
.
I
have
for
some
time
had
a
particular
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
by
any
wonderful
accident
that
he
found
her
,
the
time
of
day
*NL*
being
that
at
which
she
was
always
alone
,
and
the
place
being
her
*NL*
favourite
resort
.
It
was
an
opening
in
a
dark
wood
,
where
some
felled
*NL*
trees
lay
,
and
where
she
would
sit
watching
the
fallen
leaves
of
last
*NL*
year
,
as
she
had
watched
the
falling
ashes
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
beside
her
,
with
a
glance
at
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
brother
.
My
young
friend
Tom
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
colour
brightened
,
and
she
turned
to
him
with
a
look
of
interest
.
'
I
*NL*
never
in
my
life
,
'
he
thought
,
`
saw
anything
so
remarkable
and
so
*NL*
captivating
as
the
lighting
of
those
features
!
'
His
face
betrayed
his
*NL*
thoughts
--
perhaps
without
betraying
him
,
for
it
might
have
been
according
*NL*
to
its
instructions
so
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pardon
me
.
The
expression
of
your
sisterly
interest
is
so
beautiful
--
Tom
*NL*
should
be
so
proud
of
it
--
I
know
this
is
inexcusable
,
but
I
am
so
*NL*
compelled
to
admire
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Being
so
impulsive
,
'
she
said
composedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
no
:
you
know
I
make
no
pretence
with
you
.
You
know
I
am
*NL*
a
sordid
piece
of
human
nature
,
ready
to
sell
myself
at
any
time
for
any
*NL*
reasonable
sum
,
and
altogether
incapable
of
any
Arcadian
proceeding
*NL*
whatever
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
waiting
,
'
she
returned
,
`
for
your
further
reference
to
my
brother
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
rigid
with
me
,
and
I
deserve
it
.
I
am
as
worthless
a
dog
as
you
*NL*
will
find
,
except
that
I
am
not
false
--
not
false
.
But
you
surprised
and
*NL*
started
me
from
my
subject
,
which
was
your
brother
.
I
have
an
interest
*NL*
in
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
an
interest
in
anything
,
Mr.
Harthouse
?
'
she
asked
,
half
*NL*
incredulously
and
half
gratefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
had
asked
me
when
I
first
came
here
,
I
should
have
said
no
.
I
*NL*
must
say
now
--
even
at
the
hazard
of
appearing
to
make
a
pretence
,
and
of
*NL*
justly
awakening
your
incredulity
--
yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
a
slight
movement
,
as
if
she
were
trying
to
speak
,
but
could
not
*NL*
find
voice
;
at
length
she
said
,
`
Mr.
Harthouse
,
I
give
you
credit
for
*NL*
being
interested
in
my
brother
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
.
I
claim
to
deserve
it
.
You
know
how
little
I
do
claim
,
but
*NL*
I
will
go
that
length
.
You
have
done
so
much
for
him
,
you
are
so
fond
of
*NL*
him
;
your
whole
life
,
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
expresses
such
charming
*NL*
self-forgetfulness
on
his
account
--
pardon
me
again
--
I
am
running
wide
of
*NL*
the
subject
.
I
am
interested
in
him
for
his
own
sake
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
made
the
slightest
action
possible
,
as
if
she
would
have
risen
in
*NL*
a
hurry
and
gone
away
.
He
had
turned
the
course
of
what
he
said
at
that
*NL*
instant
,
and
she
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
'
he
resumed
,
in
a
lighter
manner
,
and
yet
with
a
show
of
*NL*
effort
in
assuming
it
,
which
was
even
more
expressive
than
the
manner
he
*NL*
dismissed
;
`
it
is
no
irrevocable
offence
in
a
young
fellow
of
your
*NL*
brother
's
years
,
if
he
is
heedless
,
inconsiderate
,
and
expensive
--
a
little
*NL*
dissipated
,
in
the
common
phrase
.
Is
he
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Allow
me
to
be
frank
.
Do
you
think
he
games
at
all
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
he
makes
bets
.
'
Mr.
Harthouse
waiting
,
as
if
that
were
not
her
*NL*
whole
answer
,
she
added
,
'
I
know
he
does
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
he
loses
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Everybody
does
lose
who
bets
.
May
I
hint
at
the
probability
of
your
*NL*
sometimes
supplying
him
with
money
for
these
purposes
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
,
looking
down
;
but
,
at
this
question
,
raised
her
eyes
searchingly
*NL*
and
a
little
resentfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Acquit
me
of
impertinent
curiosity
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Bounderby
.
I
think
Tom
*NL*
may
be
gradually
falling
into
trouble
,
and
I
wish
to
stretch
out
a
*NL*
helping
hand
to
him
from
the
depths
of
my
wicked
experience
.
--
Shall
I
say
*NL*
again
,
for
his
sake
?
Is
that
necessary
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
try
to
answer
,
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Candidly
to
confess
everything
that
has
occurred
to
me
,
'
said
James
*NL*
Harthouse
,
again
gliding
with
the
same
appearance
of
effort
into
his
more
*NL*
airy
manner
;
'
I
will
confide
to
you
my
doubt
whether
he
has
had
many
*NL*
advantages
.
Whether
--
forgive
my
plainness
--
whether
any
great
amount
of
*NL*
confidence
is
likely
to
have
been
established
between
himself
and
his
*NL*
most
worthy
father
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
not
,
'
said
Louisa
,
flushing
with
her
own
great
remembrance
in
that
*NL*
wise
,
`
think
it
likely
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Or
,
between
himself
,
and
--
I
may
trust
to
your
perfect
understanding
of
my
*NL*
meaning
,
I
am
sure
--
and
his
highly
esteemed
brother-in-law
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
deeper
and
deeper
,
and
was
burning
red
when
she
replied
in
a
*NL*
fainter
voice
,
'
I
do
not
think
that
likely
,
either
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
'
said
Harthouse
,
after
a
short
silence
,
`
may
there
be
a
*NL*
better
confidence
between
yourself
and
me
?
Tom
has
borrowed
a
*NL*
considerable
sum
of
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
understand
,
Mr.
Harthouse
,
'
she
returned
,
after
some
*NL*
indecision
:
she
had
been
more
or
less
uncertain
,
and
troubled
throughout
*NL*
the
conversation
,
and
yet
had
in
the
main
preserved
her
self-contained
*NL*
manner
;
`
you
will
understand
that
if
I
tell
you
what
you
press
to
know
,
*NL*
it
is
not
by
way
of
complaint
or
regret
.
I
would
never
complain
of
*NL*
anything
,
and
what
I
have
done
I
do
not
in
the
least
regret
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
spirited
,
too
!
'
thought
James
Harthouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
married
,
I
found
that
my
brother
was
even
at
that
time
heavily
in
*NL*
debt
.
Heavily
for
him
,
I
mean
.
Heavily
enough
to
oblige
me
to
sell
some
*NL*
trinkets
.
They
were
no
sacrifice
.
I
sold
them
very
willingly
.
I
*NL*
attached
no
value
to
them
.
They
,
were
quite
worthless
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Either
she
saw
in
his
face
that
he
knew
,
or
she
only
feared
in
her
*NL*
conscience
that
he
knew
,
that
she
spoke
of
some
of
her
husband
's
gifts
.
*NL*
She
stopped
,
and
reddened
again
.
If
he
had
not
known
it
before
,
he
would
*NL*
have
known
it
then
,
though
he
had
been
a
much
duller
man
than
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Since
then
,
I
have
given
my
brother
,
at
various
times
,
what
money
I
*NL*
could
spare
:
in
short
,
what
money
I
have
had
.
Confiding
in
you
at
all
,
*NL*
on
the
faith
of
the
interest
you
profess
for
him
,
I
will
not
do
so
by
*NL*
halves
.
Since
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
here
,
he
has
wanted
*NL*
in
one
sum
as
much
as
a
hundred
pounds
.
I
have
not
been
able
to
give
it
*NL*
to
him
.
I
have
felt
uneasy
for
the
consequences
of
his
being
so
*NL*
involved
,
but
I
have
kept
these
secrets
until
now
,
when
I
trust
them
to
*NL*
your
honour
.
I
have
held
no
confidence
with
any
one
,
because
--
you
*NL*
anticipated
my
reason
just
now
.
'
She
abruptly
broke
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
ready
man
,
and
he
saw
,
and
seized
,
an
opportunity
here
of
*NL*
presenting
her
own
image
to
her
,
slightly
disguised
as
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
though
a
graceless
person
,
of
the
world
worldly
,
I
feel
*NL*
the
utmost
interest
,
I
assure
you
,
in
what
you
tell
me
.
I
can
not
*NL*
possibly
be
hard
upon
your
brother
.
I
understand
and
share
the
wise
*NL*
consideration
with
which
you
regard
his
errors
.
With
all
possible
*NL*
respect
both
for
Mr.
Gradgrind
and
for
Mr.
Bounderby
,
I
think
I
perceive
*NL*
that
he
has
not
been
fortunate
in
his
training
.
Bred
at
a
disadvantage
*NL*
towards
the
society
in
which
he
has
his
part
to
play
,
he
rushes
into
*NL*
these
extremes
for
himself
,
from
opposite
extremes
that
have
long
been
*NL*
forced
--
with
the
very
best
intentions
we
have
no
doubt
--
upon
him
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
's
fine
bluff
English
independence
,
though
a
most
charming
*NL*
characteristic
,
does
not
--
as
we
have
agreed
--
invite
confidence
.
If
I
might
*NL*
venture
to
remark
that
it
is
the
least
in
the
world
deficient
in
that
*NL*
delicacy
to
which
a
youth
mistaken
,
a
character
misconceived
,
and
*NL*
abilities
misdirected
,
would
turn
for
relief
and
guidance
,
I
should
*NL*
express
what
it
presents
to
my
own
view
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
sat
looking
straight
before
her
,
across
the
changing
lights
upon
*NL*
the
grass
into
the
darkness
of
the
wood
beyond
,
he
saw
in
her
face
her
*NL*
application
of
his
very
distinctly
uttered
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
allowance
,
'
he
continued
,
`
must
be
made
.
I
have
one
great
fault
to
*NL*
find
with
Tom
,
however
,
which
I
can
not
forgive
,
and
for
which
I
take
him
*NL*
heavily
to
account
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
turned
her
eyes
to
his
face
,
and
asked
him
what
fault
was
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
,
'
he
returned
,
'
I
have
said
enough
.
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
*NL*
better
,
on
the
whole
,
if
no
allusion
to
it
had
escaped
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
alarm
me
,
Mr.
Harthouse
.
Pray
let
me
know
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
relieve
you
from
needless
apprehension
--
and
as
this
confidence
*NL*
regarding
your
brother
,
which
I
prize
I
am
sure
above
all
possible
*NL*
things
,
has
been
established
between
us
--
I
obey
.
I
can
not
forgive
him
for
*NL*
not
being
more
sensible
in
every
word
,
look
,
and
act
of
his
life
,
of
the
*NL*
affection
of
his
best
friend
;
of
the
devotion
of
his
best
friend
;
of
her
*NL*
unselfishness
;
of
her
sacrifice
.
The
return
he
makes
her
,
within
my
*NL*
observation
,
is
a
very
poor
one
.
What
she
has
done
for
him
demands
his
*NL*
constant
love
and
gratitude
,
not
his
ill-humour
and
caprice
.
Careless
*NL*
fellow
as
I
am
,
I
am
not
so
indifferent
,
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
as
to
be
*NL*
regardless
of
this
vice
in
your
brother
,
or
inclined
to
consider
it
a
*NL*
venial
offence
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
wood
floated
before
her
,
for
her
eyes
were
suffused
with
tears
.
They
*NL*
rose
from
a
deep
well
,
long
concealed
,
and
her
heart
was
filled
with
*NL*
acute
pain
that
found
no
relief
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
a
word
,
it
is
to
correct
your
brother
in
this
,
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
that
I
*NL*
must
aspire
.
My
better
knowledge
of
his
circumstances
,
and
my
direction
*NL*
and
advice
in
extricating
them
--
rather
valuable
,
I
hope
,
as
coming
from
a
*NL*
scapegrace
on
a
much
larger
scale
--
will
give
me
some
influence
over
him
,
*NL*
and
all
I
gain
I
shall
certainly
use
towards
this
end
.
I
have
said
*NL*
enough
,
and
more
than
enough
.
I
seem
to
be
protesting
that
I
am
a
sort
*NL*
of
good
fellow
,
when
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
have
not
the
least
intention
to
*NL*
make
any
protestation
to
that
effect
,
and
openly
announce
that
I
am
*NL*
nothing
of
the
sort
.
Yonder
,
among
the
trees
,
'
he
added
,
having
lifted
*NL*
up
his
eyes
and
looked
about
;
for
he
had
watched
her
closely
until
now
;
*NL*
`
is
your
brother
himself
;
no
doubt
,
just
come
down
.
As
he
seems
to
be
*NL*
loitering
in
this
direction
,
it
may
be
as
well
,
perhaps
,
to
walk
towards
*NL*
him
,
and
throw
ourselves
in
his
way
.
He
has
been
very
silent
and
doleful
*NL*
of
late
.
Perhaps
,
his
brotherly
conscience
is
touched
--
if
there
are
such
*NL*
things
as
consciences
.
Though
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
hear
of
them
much
too
*NL*
often
to
believe
in
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
assisted
her
to
rise
,
and
she
took
his
arm
,
and
they
advanced
to
meet
*NL*
the
whelp
.
He
was
idly
beating
the
branches
as
he
lounged
along
:
or
he
*NL*
stooped
viciously
to
rip
the
moss
from
the
trees
with
his
stick
.
He
was
*NL*
startled
when
they
came
upon
him
while
he
was
engaged
in
this
latter
*NL*
pastime
,
and
his
colour
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Halloa
!
'
he
stammered
;
'
I
did
n't
know
you
were
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whose
name
,
Tom
,
'
said
Mr.
Harthouse
,
putting
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
*NL*
and
turning
him
,
so
that
they
all
three
walked
towards
the
house
*NL*
together
,
`
have
you
been
carving
on
the
trees
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whose
name

'
returned
Tom
.
`
Oh
!
You
mean
what
girl
's
name
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
a
suspicious
appearance
of
inscribing
some
fair
creature

on
*NL*
the
bark

Not
much
of

Mr.

,
unless
some
fair
creature
with
a
*NL*
slashing
fortune
at
her
own
disposal
would
take
a
fancy

Or
she

might
be
as
ugly

rich

often

Have
you
so
proved

said
Louisa
,

showing
no
other
sense

his
discontent
and
ill-nature
.

You

her

sulkily

`
If
it
does

said
Mr.

`
Do

At

said
Tom
,
softening
in
his
admiration
of
*NL*
his
patron
,
but
shaking
his
head
sullenly
too
,
`
you
ca
n't
tell
her
that

ever
praised

I
may
have
praised
her
for

the
contrary

I
should
do
it
again

good
reason

However

never

this
now

*NL*
They
walked
on
to
the
house
,
where
Louisa
quitted
her
visitor
's
arm
and
*NL*
went
in
.
He
stood
looking
after
her
,
as
she
ascended
the
steps
,
and
*NL*
passed
into
the
shadow
of
the
door
;
then
put
his
hand
upon
her
brother
's
*NL*
shoulder
again
,
and
invited
him
with
a
confidential
nod
to
a
walk
in
the
*NL*
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tom
,
my
fine
fellow
,
I
want
to
have
a
word

*NL*
*NL*
They
had
stopped
among
a
disorder
of
roses
--
it
was
part
of
Mr.
Bounderby
's
*NL*
humility
to
keep
Nickits
's
roses
on
a
reduced
scale
--
and
Tom
sat
down
on
a
*NL*
terrace-parapet
,
plucking
buds
and
picking
them
to
pieces
;
while
his
*NL*
powerful
Familiar
stood
over
him
,
with
a
foot
upon
the
parapet
,
and
his
*NL*
figure
easily
resting
on
the
arm
supported
by
that
knee
.
They
were
just
*NL*
visible
from
her
window
.
Perhaps
she
saw
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tom
,
what
's
the
matter
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
Mr.
Harthouse
,
'
said
Tom
with
a
groan
,
'
I
am
hard
up
,
and
bothered
*NL*
out
of
my
life

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
good
fellow

so
am
I.

!

returned
Tom
.
`
You
are
the
picture
of
independence

Mr.
*NL*
Harthouse
,
I
am
in
a
horrible
mess
.
You
have
no
idea
what
a
state
I
have
*NL*
got
myself
into

what
a
state
my
sister
might
have
got
me
out
of

if
she
*NL*
would
only
have
done
it

*NL*
*NL*
He
took
to
biting
the
rosebuds
now
,
and
tearing
them
away
from
his
teeth
*NL*
with
a
hand
that
trembled
like
an
infirm
old
man
's
.
After
one
*NL*
exceedingly
observant
look
at
him
,
his
companion
relapsed
into
his
*NL*
lightest
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tom
,
you
are
inconsiderate
:
you
expect
too
much
of
your
sister

You
*NL*
have
had
money
of
her
,
you
dog
,
you
know
you
have
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Mr.
Harthouse
,
I
know
I
have
.
How
else
was
I
to
get
it
?
Here
's
*NL*
old
Bounderby
always
boasting
that
at
my
age
he
lived
upon
twopence
a
*NL*
month
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
Here
's
my
father
drawing
what
he
calls
*NL*
a
line
,
and
tying
me
down
to
it
from
a
baby
,
neck
and
heels
.
Here
's
my
*NL*
mother
who
never
has
anything
of
her
own
,
except
her
complaints
.
What
*NL*
_
is
_
a
fellow
to
do
for
money
,
and
where
_
am
_
I
to
look
for
it
,
if
not
to
*NL*
my
sister
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
almost
crying
,
and
scattered
the
buds
about
by
dozens
.
Mr.
*NL*
Harthouse
took
him
persuasively
by
the
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
my
dear
Tom
,
if
your
sister
has
not
got
it
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
got
it
,
Mr.
Harthouse
?
I
do
n't
say
she
has
got
it
.
I
may
have
*NL*
wanted
more
than
she
was
likely
to
have
got
.
But
then
she
ought
to
get
*NL*
it
.
She
could
get
it
.
It
's
of
no
use
pretending
to
make
a
secret
of
*NL*
matters
now
,
after
what
I
have
told
you
already
;
you
know
she
did
n't
*NL*
marry
old
Bounderby
for
her
own
sake
,
or
for
his
sake
,
but
for
my
sake
.
*NL*
Then
why
does
n't
she
get
what
I
want
,
out
of
him
,
for
my
sake
?
She
is
*NL*
not
obliged
to
say
what
she
is
going
to
do
with
it
;
she
is
sharp
enough
;
*NL*
she
could
manage
to
coax
it
out
of
him
,
if
she
chose
.
Then
why
does
n't
*NL*
she
choose
,
when
I
tell
her
of
what
consequence
it
is
?
But
no
.
There
*NL*
she
sits
in
his
company
like
a
stone
,
instead
of
making
herself
agreeable
*NL*
and
getting
it
easily
.
I
do
n't
know
what
you
may
call
this
,
but
I
call
*NL*
it
unnatural
conduct
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
piece
of
ornamental
water
immediately
below
the
parapet
,
on
*NL*
the
other
side
,
into
which
Mr.
James
Harthouse
had
a
very
strong
*NL*
inclination
to
pitch
Mr.
Thomas
Gradgrind
junior
,
as
the
injured
men
of
*NL*
Coketown
threatened
to
pitch
their
property
into
the
Atlantic
.
But
he
*NL*
preserved
his
easy
attitude
;
and
nothing
more
solid
went
over
the
stone
*NL*
balustrades
than
the
accumulated
rosebuds
now
floating
about
,
a
little
*NL*
surface-island
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Tom
,
'
said
Harthouse
,
`
let
me
try
to
be
your
banker
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
God
's
sake
,
'
replied
Tom
,
suddenly
,
`
do
n't
talk
about
bankers
!
'
And
*NL*
very
white
he
looked
,
in
contrast
with
the
roses
.
Very
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Harthouse
,
as
a
thoroughly
well-bred
man
,
accustomed
to
the
best
*NL*
society
,
was
not
to
be
surprised
--
he
could
as
soon
have
been
affected
--
but
*NL*
he
raised
his
eyelids
a
little
more
,
as
if
they
were
lifted
by
a
feeble
*NL*
touch
of
wonder
.
Albeit
it
was
as
much
against
the
precepts
of
his
*NL*
school
to
wonder
,
as
it
was
against
the
doctrines
of
the
Gradgrind
*NL*
College
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
the
present
need
,
Tom
?
Three
figures
?
Out
with
them
.
Say
what
*NL*
they
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Harthouse
,
'
returned
Tom
,
now
actually
crying
;
and
his
tears
were
*NL*
better
than
his
injuries
,
however
pitiful
a
figure
he
made
:
`
it
's
too
*NL*
late
;
the
money
is
of
no
use
to
me
at
present
.
I
should
have
had
it
*NL*
before
to
be
of
use
to
me
.
But
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
;
you
're
a
*NL*
true
friend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
true
friend
!
`
Whelp
,
whelp
!
'
thought
Mr.
Harthouse
,
lazily
;
`
what
an
*NL*
Ass
you
are
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
take
your
offer
as
a
great
kindness
,
'
said
Tom
,
grasping
his
hand
.
*NL*
`
As
a
great
kindness
,
Mr.
Harthouse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
returned
the
other
,
`
it
may
be
of
more
use
by
and
by
.
And
,
my
*NL*
good
fellow
,
if
you
will
open
your
bedevilments
to
me
when
they
come
*NL*
thick
upon
you
,
I
may
show
you
better
ways
out
of
them
than
you
can
find
*NL*
for
yourself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
'
said
Tom
,
shaking
his
head
dismally
,
and
chewing
rosebuds
.
*NL*
'
I
wish
I
had
known
you
sooner
,
Mr.
Harthouse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
you
see
,
Tom
,
'
said
Mr.
Harthouse
in
conclusion
,
himself
tossing
*NL*
over
a
rose
or
two
,
as
a
contribution
to
the
island
,
which
was
always
*NL*
drifting
to
the
wall
as
if
it
wanted
to
become
a
part
of
the
mainland
:
*NL*
`
every
man
is
selfish
in
everything
he
does
,
and
I
am
exactly
like
the
*NL*
rest
of
my
fellow-creatures
.
I
am
desperately
intent
;
'
the
languor
of
*NL*
his
desperation
being
quite
tropical
;
`
on
your
softening
towards
your
*NL*
sister
--
which
you
ought
to
do
;
and
on
your
being
a
more
loving
and
*NL*
agreeable
sort
of
brother
--
which
you
ought
to
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
be
,
Mr.
Harthouse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
time
like
the
present
,
Tom
.
Begin
at
once
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
I
will
.
And
my
sister
Loo
shall
say
so
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Having
made
which
bargain
,
Tom
,
'
said
Harthouse
,
clapping
him
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
again
,
with
an
air
which
left
him
at
liberty
to
infer
--
as
he
did
,
*NL*
poor
fool
--
that
this
condition
was
imposed
upon
him
in
mere
careless
good
*NL*
nature
to
lessen
his
sense
of
obligation
,
`
we
will
tear
ourselves
asunder
*NL*
until
dinner-time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
When
Tom
appeared
before
dinner
,
though
his
mind
seemed
heavy
enough
,
his
*NL*
body
was
on
the
alert
;
and
he
appeared
before
Mr.
Bounderby
came
in
.
'
I
*NL*
did
n't
mean
to
be
cross
,
Loo
,
'
he
said
,
giving
her
his
hand
,
and
kissing
*NL*
her
.
'
I
know
you
are
fond
of
me
,
and
you
know
I
am
fond
of
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
there
was
a
smile
upon
Louisa
's
face
that
day
,
for
some
one
*NL*
else
.
Alas
,
for
some
one
else
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
much
the
less
is
the
whelp
the
only
creature
that
she
cares
for
,
'
*NL*
thought
James
Harthouse
,
reversing
the
reflection
of
his
first
day
's
*NL*
knowledge
of
her
pretty
face
.
`
So
much
the
less
,
so
much
the
less
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
EXPLOSION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
next
morning
was
too
bright
a
morning
for
sleep
,
and
James
Harthouse
*NL*
rose
early
,
and
sat
in
the
pleasant
bay
window
of
his
dressing-room
,
*NL*
smoking
the
rare
tobacco
that
had
had
so
wholesome
an
influence
on
his
*NL*
young
friend
.
Reposing
in
the
sunlight
,
with
the
fragrance
of
his
*NL*
eastern
pipe
about
him
,
and
the
dreamy
smoke
vanishing
into
the
air
,
so
*NL*
rich
and
soft
with
summer
odours
,
he
reckoned
up
his
advantages
as
an
*NL*
idle
winner
might
count
his
gains
.
He
was
not
at
all
bored
for
the
time
,
*NL*
and
could
give
his
mind
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
established
a
confidence
with
her
,
from
which
her
husband
was
*NL*
excluded
.
He
had
established
a
confidence
with
her
,
that
absolutely
*NL*
turned
upon
her
indifference
towards
her
husband
,
and
the
absence
,
now
*NL*
and
at
all
times
,
of
any
congeniality
between
them
.
He
had
artfully
,
but
*NL*
plainly
,
assured
her
that
he
knew
her
heart
in
its
last
most
delicate
*NL*
recesses
;
he
had
come
so
near
to
her
through
its
tenderest
sentiment
;
he
*NL*
had
associated
himself
with
that
feeling
;
and
the
barrier
behind
which
*NL*
she
lived
,
had
melted
away
.
All
very
odd
,
and
very
satisfactory
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
had
not
,
even
now
,
any
earnest
wickedness
of
purpose
in
him
.
*NL*
Publicly
and
privately
,
it
were
much
better
for
the
age
in
which
he
*NL*
lived
,
that
he
and
the
legion
of
whom
he
was
one
were
designedly
bad
,
*NL*
than
indifferent
and
purposeless
.
It
is
the
drifting
icebergs
setting
*NL*
with
any
current
anywhere
,
that
wreck
the
ships
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Devil
goeth
about
like
a
roaring
lion
,
he
goeth
about
in
a
shape
*NL*
by
which
few
but
savages
and
hunters
are
attracted
.
But
,
when
he
is
*NL*
trimmed
,
smoothed
,
and
varnished
,
according
to
the
mode
;
when
he
is
*NL*
aweary
of
vice
,
and
aweary
of
virtue
,
used
up
as
to
brimstone
,
and
used
*NL*
up
as
to
bliss
;
then
,
whether
he
take
to
the
serving
out
of
red
tape
,
or
*NL*
to
the
kindling
of
red
fire
,
he
is
the
very
Devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
James
Harthouse
reclined
in
the
window
,
indolently
smoking
,
and
*NL*
reckoning
up
the
steps
he
had
taken
on
the
road
by
which
he
happened
to
*NL*
be
travelling
.
The
end
to
which
it
led
was
before
him
,
pretty
plainly
;
*NL*
but
he
troubled
himself
with
no
calculations
about
it
.
What
will
be
,
*NL*
will
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
rather
a
long
ride
to
take
that
day
--
for
there
was
a
public
*NL*
occasion
`
to
do
'
at
some
distance
,
which
afforded
a
tolerable
opportunity
*NL*
of
going
in
for
the
Gradgrind
men
--
he
dressed
early
and
went
down
to
*NL*
breakfast
.
He
was
anxious
to
see
if
she
had
relapsed
since
the
previous
*NL*
evening
.
No
.
He
resumed
where
he
had
left
off
.
There
was
a
look
of
*NL*
interest
for
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
through
the
day
as
much
-LRB-
or
as
little
-RRB-
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
as
*NL*
was
to
be
expected
under
the
fatiguing
circumstances
;
and
came
riding
*NL*
back
at
six
o'clock
.
There
was
a
sweep
of
some
half-mile
between
the
*NL*
lodge
and
the
house
,
and
he
was
riding
along
at
a
foot
pace
over
the
*NL*
smooth
gravel
,
once
Nickits
's
,
when
Mr.
Bounderby
burst
out
of
the
*NL*
shrubbery
,
with
such
violence
as
to
make
his
horse
shy
across
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Harthouse
!
'
cried
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
Have
you
heard
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heard
what
?
'
said
Harthouse
,
soothing
his
horse
,
and
inwardly
favouring
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
with
no
good
wishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
you
_
have
n't
_
heard
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
heard
you
,
and
so
has
this
brute
.
I
have
heard
nothing
else
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
red
and
hot
,
planted
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
path
*NL*
before
the
horse
's
head
,
to
explode
his
bombshell
with
more
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
Bank
's
robbed
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
mean
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Robbed
last
night
,
sir
.
Robbed
in
an
extraordinary
manner
.
Robbed
with
*NL*
a
false
key
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
much
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
in
his
desire
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
really
seemed
*NL*
mortified
by
being
obliged
to
reply
,
`
Why
,
no
;
not
of
very
much
.
But
it
*NL*
might
have
been
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
how
much
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
as
a
sum
--
if
you
stick
to
a
sum
--
of
not
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
pound
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
with
impatience
.
`
But
it
's
not
the
sum
;
it
's
the
*NL*
fact
.
It
's
the
fact
of
the
Bank
being
robbed
,
that
's
the
important
*NL*
circumstance
.
I
am
surprised
you
do
n't
see
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Bounderby
,
'
said
James
,
dismounting
,
and
giving
his
bridle
to
*NL*
his
servant
,
'
I
_
do
_
see
it
;
and
am
as
overcome
as
you
can
possibly
*NL*
desire
me
to
be
,
by
the
spectacle
afforded
to
my
mental
view
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
I
may
be
allowed
,
I
hope
,
to
congratulate
you
--
which
I
do
*NL*
with
all
my
soul
,
I
assure
you
--
on
your
not
having
sustained
a
greater
*NL*
loss
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
`
ee
,
'
replied
Bounderby
,
in
a
short
,
ungracious
manner
.
`
But
I
*NL*
tell
you
what
.
It
might
have
been
twenty
thousand
pound
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
it
might
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suppose
it
might
!
By
the
Lord
,
you
_
may
_
suppose
so
.
By
George
!
'
said
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
with
sundry
menacing
nods
and
shakes
of
his
head
.
`
It
*NL*
might
have
been
twice
twenty
.
There
's
no
knowing
what
it
would
have
*NL*
been
,
or
would
n't
have
been
,
as
it
was
,
but
for
the
fellows
'
being
*NL*
disturbed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
had
come
up
now
,
and
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
and
Bitzer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
's
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
knows
pretty
well
what
it
might
have
*NL*
been
,
if
you
do
n't
,
'
blustered
Bounderby
.
`
Dropped
,
sir
,
as
if
she
was
*NL*
shot
when
I
told
her
!
Never
knew
her
do
such
a
thing
before
.
Does
her
*NL*
credit
,
under
the
circumstances
,
in
my
opinion
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
still
looked
faint
and
pale
.
James
Harthouse
begged
her
to
take
his
*NL*
arm
;
and
as
they
moved
on
very
slowly
,
asked
her
how
the
robbery
had
been
*NL*
committed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
am
going
to
tell
you
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
irritably
giving
his
arm
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
If
you
had
n't
been
so
mighty
particular
about
the
sum
,
*NL*
I
should
have
begun
to
tell
you
before

*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
already
had
the
honour
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
well
.
And
this
young
man
,
Bitzer
,
you
saw
him
too
on
the
same
*NL*
occasion
?
'
Mr.
Harthouse
inclined
his
head
in
assent
,
and
Bitzer
*NL*
knuckled
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
well
.
They
live
at
the
Bank
.
You
know
they
live
at
the
Bank
,
*NL*
perhaps
?
Very
well
.
Yesterday
afternoon
,
at
the
close
of
business
*NL*
hours
,
everything
was
put
away
as
usual
.
In
the
iron
room
that
this
*NL*
young
fellow
sleeps
outside
of
,
there
was
never
mind
how
much
.
In
the
*NL*
little
safe
in
young
Tom
's
closet
,
the
safe
used
for
petty
purposes
,
*NL*
there
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
odd
pound
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
hundred
and
fifty-four
,
seven
,
one
,
'
said
Bitzer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
!
'
retorted
Bounderby
,
stopping
to
wheel
round
upon
him
,
`
let
's
have
*NL*
none
of
_
your
_
interruptions
.
It
's
enough
to
be
robbed
while
you
're
*NL*
snoring
because
you
're
too
comfortable
,
without
being
put
right
with
*NL*
_
your
_
four
seven
ones
.
I
did
n't
snore
,
myself
,
when
I
was
your
age
,
let
*NL*
me
tell
you
.
I
had
n't
victuals
enough
to
snore
.
And
I
did
n't
four
seven
*NL*
one
.
Not
if
I
knew
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Bitzer
knuckled
his
forehead
again
,
in
a
sneaking
manner
,
and
seemed
at
*NL*
once
particularly
impressed
and
depressed
by
the
instance
last
given
of
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
's
moral
abstinence
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
hundred
and
fifty
odd
pound
,
'
resumed
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
That
sum
of
*NL*
money
,
young
Tom
locked
in
his
safe
,
not
a
very
strong
safe
,
but
that
's
*NL*
no
matter
now
.
Everything
was
left
,
all
right
.
Some
time
in
the
night
,
*NL*
while
this
young
fellow
snored
--
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
you
say
you
have
*NL*
heard
him
snore
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
'
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
heard
him
*NL*
precisely
snore
,
and
therefore
must
not
make
that
statement
.
But
on
*NL*
winter
evenings
,
when
he
has
fallen
asleep
at
his
table
,
I
have
heard
*NL*
him
,
what
I
should
prefer
to
describe
as
partially
choke
.
I
have
heard
*NL*
him
on
such
occasions
produce
sounds
of
a
nature
similar
to
what
may
be
*NL*
sometimes
heard
in
Dutch
clocks
.
Not
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
a
lofty
*NL*
sense
of
giving
strict
evidence
,
`
that
I
would
convey
any
imputation
on
*NL*
his
moral
character
.
Far
from
it
.
I
have
always
considered
Bitzer
a
*NL*
young
man
of
the
most
upright
principle
;
and
to
that
I
beg
to
bear
my
*NL*
testimony
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
said
the
exasperated
Bounderby
,
`
while
he
was
snoring
,
_
or
_
*NL*
choking
,
_
or
_
Dutch-clocking
,
_
or
_
something
_
or
_
other
--
being
asleep
--
some
*NL*
fellows
,
somehow
,
whether
previously
concealed
in
the
house
or
not
*NL*
remains
to
be
seen
,
got
to
young
Tom
's
safe
,
forced
it
,
and
abstracted
*NL*
the
contents
.
Being
then
disturbed
,
they
made
off
;
letting
themselves
*NL*
out
at
the
main
door
,
and
double-locking
it
again
-LRB-
it
was
double-locked
,
*NL*
and
the
key
under
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
pillow
-RRB-
with
a
false
key
,
which
was
*NL*
picked
up
in
the
street
near
the
Bank
,
about
twelve
o'clock
to-day
.
No
*NL*
alarm
takes
place
,
till
this
chap
,
Bitzer
,
turns
out
this
morning
,
and
*NL*
begins
to
open
and
prepare
the
offices
for
business
.
Then
,
looking
at
*NL*
Tom
's
safe
,
he
sees
the
door
ajar
,
and
finds
the
lock
forced
,
and
the
*NL*
money
gone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
is
Tom
,
by
the
by
?
'
asked
Harthouse
,
glancing
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
has
been
helping
the
police
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
and
stays
behind
at
*NL*
the
Bank
.
I
wish
these
fellows
had
tried
to
rob
me
when
I
was
at
his
*NL*
time
of
life
.
They
would
have
been
out
of
pocket
if
they
had
invested
*NL*
eighteenpence
in
the
job
;
I
can
tell
'em
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
anybody
suspected
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suspected
?
I
should
think
there
was
somebody
suspected
.
Egod
!
'
said
*NL*
Bounderby
,
relinquishing
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
arm
to
wipe
his
heated
head
.
*NL*
`
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
is
not
to
be
plundered
and
nobody
*NL*
suspected
.
No
,
thank
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Might
Mr.
Harthouse
inquire
Who
was
suspected
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
stopping
and
facing
about
to
confront
them
all
,
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
you
.
It
's
not
to
be
mentioned
everywhere
;
it
's
not
to
be
*NL*
mentioned
anywhere
:
in
order
that
the
scoundrels
concerned
-LRB-
there
's
a
*NL*
gang
of
'em
-RRB-
may
be
thrown
off
their
guard
.
So
take
this
in
confidence
.
*NL*
Now
wait
a
bit
.
'
Mr.
Bounderby
wiped
his
head
again
.
`
What
should
you
*NL*
say
to
;
'
here
he
violently
exploded
:
`
to
a
Hand
being
in
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
,
'
said
Harthouse
,
lazily
,
`
not
our
friend
Blackpot
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Say
Pool
instead
of
Pot
,
sir
,
'
returned
Bounderby
,
`
and
that
's
the
man
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
faintly
uttered
some
word
of
incredulity
and
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
yes
!
I
know
!
'
said
Bounderby
,
immediately
catching
at
the
sound
.
'
I
*NL*
know
!
I
am
used
to
that
.
I
know
all
about
it
.
They
are
the
finest
*NL*
people
in
the
world
,
these
fellows
are
.
They
have
got
the
gift
of
the
*NL*
gab
,
they
have
.
They
only
want
to
have
their
rights
explained
to
them
,
*NL*
they
do
.
But
I
tell
you
what
.
Show
me
a
dissatisfied
Hand
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
show
you
a
man
that
's
fit
for
anything
bad
,
I
do
n't
care
what
it
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Another
of
the
popular
fictions
of
Coketown
,
which
some
pains
had
been
*NL*
taken
to
disseminate
--
and
which
some
people
really
believed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
am
acquainted
with
these
chaps
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
'
I
can
read
'em
*NL*
off
,
like
books
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
I
appeal
to
you
.
What
warning
did
*NL*
I
give
that
fellow
,
the
first
time
he
set
foot
in
the
house
,
when
the
*NL*
express
object
of
his
visit
was
to
know
how
he
could
knock
Religion
over
,
*NL*
and
floor
the
Established
Church
?
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
in
point
of
high
*NL*
connexions
,
you
are
on
a
level
with
the
aristocracy
,
--
did
I
say
,
or
did
I
*NL*
not
say
,
to
that
fellow
,
``
you
ca
n't
hide
the
truth
from
me
:
you
are
not
*NL*
the
kind
of
fellow
I
like
;
you
'll
come
to
no
good
''
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Assuredly
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
you
did
,
in
a
highly
impressive
*NL*
manner
,
give
him
such
an
admonition
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
he
shocked
you
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
;
`
when
he
shocked
your
*NL*
feelings
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
a
meek
shake
of
her
head
,
`
he
*NL*
certainly
did
so
.
Though
I
do
not
mean
to
say
but
that
my
feelings
may
*NL*
be
weaker
on
such
points
--
more
foolish
if
the
term
is
preferred
--
than
they
*NL*
might
have
been
,
if
I
had
always
occupied
my
present
position
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
stared
with
a
bursting
pride
at
Mr.
Harthouse
,
as
much
as
*NL*
to
say
,
'
I
am
the
proprietor
of
this
female
,
and
she
's
worth
your
*NL*
attention
,
I
think
.
'
Then
,
resumed
his
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
can
recall
for
yourself
,
Harthouse
,
what
I
said
to
him
when
you
saw
*NL*
him
.
I
did
n't
mince
the
matter
with
him
.
I
am
never
mealy
with
'em
.
I
*NL*
KNOW
'em
.
Very
well
,
sir
.
Three
days
after
that
,
he
bolted
.
Went
off
,
*NL*
nobody
knows
where
:
as
my
mother
did
in
my
infancy
--
only
with
this
*NL*
difference
,
that
he
is
a
worse
subject
than
my
mother
,
if
possible
.
What
*NL*
did
he
do
before
he
went
?
What
do
you
say
;
'
Mr.
Bounderby
,
with
his
hat
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
gave
a
beat
upon
the
crown
at
every
little
division
of
his
*NL*
sentences
,
as
if
it
were
a
tambourine
;
`
to
his
being
seen
--
night
after
*NL*
night
--
watching
the
Bank
?
--
to
his
lurking
about
there
--
after
dark
?
--
To
its
*NL*
striking
Mrs.
Sparsit
--
that
he
could
be
lurking
for
no
good
--
To
her
calling
*NL*
Bitzer
's
attention
to
him
,
and
their
both
taking
notice
of
him
--
And
to
its
*NL*
appearing
on
inquiry
to-day
--
that
he
was
also
noticed
by
the
neighbours
?
'
*NL*
Having
come
to
the
climax
,
Mr.
Bounderby
,
like
an
oriental
dancer
,
put
*NL*
his
tambourine
on
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suspicious
,
'
said
James
Harthouse
,
`
certainly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
so
,
sir
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
with
a
defiant
nod
.
'
I
think
so
.
But
*NL*
there
are
more
of
'em
in
it
.
There
's
an
old
woman
.
One
never
hears
of
*NL*
these
things
till
the
mischief
's
done
;
all
sorts
of
defects
are
found
out
*NL*
in
the
stable
door
after
the
horse
is
stolen
;
there
's
an
old
woman
turns
*NL*
up
now
.
An
old
woman
who
seems
to
have
been
flying
into
town
on
a
*NL*
broomstick
,
every
now
and
then
.
_
She
_
watches
the
place
a
whole
day
*NL*
before
this
fellow
begins
,
and
on
the
night
when
you
saw
him
,
she
steals
*NL*
away
with
him
and
holds
a
council
with
him
--
I
suppose
,
to
make
her
report
*NL*
on
going
off
duty
,
and
be
damned
to
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
a
person
in
the
room
that
night
,
and
she
shrunk
from
*NL*
observation
,
thought
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
not
all
of
'em
,
even
as
we
already
know
'em
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
*NL*
with
many
nods
of
hidden
meaning
.
`
But
I
have
said
enough
for
the
*NL*
present
.
You
'll
have
the
goodness
to
keep
it
quiet
,
and
mention
it
to
no
*NL*
one
.
It
may
take
time
,
but
we
shall
have
'em
.
It
's
policy
to
give
'em
*NL*
line
enough
,
and
there
's
no
objection
to
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
,
they
will
be
punished
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
,
as
*NL*
notice-boards
observe
,
'
replied
James
Harthouse
,
`
and
serve
them
right
.
*NL*
Fellows
who
go
in
for
Banks
must
take
the
consequences
.
If
there
were
no
*NL*
consequences
,
we
should
all
go
in
for
Banks
.
'
He
had
gently
taken
*NL*
Louisa
's
parasol
from
her
hand
,
and
had
put
it
up
for
her
;
and
she
walked
*NL*
under
its
shade
,
though
the
sun
did
not
shine
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
the
present
,
Loo
Bounderby
,
'
said
her
husband
,
`
here
's
Mrs.
Sparsit
*NL*
to
look
after
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
nerves
have
been
acted
upon
by
this
*NL*
business
,
and
she
'll
stay
here
a
day
or
two
.
So
make
her
comfortable
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
very
much
,
sir
,
'
that
discreet
lady
observed
,
`
but
pray
do
not
*NL*
let
My
comfort
be
a
consideration
.
Anything
will
do
for
Me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
soon
appeared
that
if
Mrs.
Sparsit
had
a
failing
in
her
association
*NL*
with
that
domestic
establishment
,
it
was
that
she
was
so
excessively
*NL*
regardless
of
herself
and
regardful
of
others
,
as
to
be
a
nuisance
.
On
*NL*
being
shown
her
chamber
,
she
was
so
dreadfully
sensible
of
its
comforts
*NL*
as
to
suggest
the
inference
that
she
would
have
preferred
to
pass
the
*NL*
night
on
the
mangle
in
the
laundry
.
True
,
the
Powlers
and
the
Scadgerses
*NL*
were
accustomed
to
splendour
,
`
but
it
is
my
duty
to
remember
,
'
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
was
fond
of
observing
with
a
lofty
grace
:
particularly
when
any
*NL*
of
the
domestics
were
present
,
`
that
what
I
was
,
I
am
no
longer
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
'
said
she
,
`
if
I
could
altogether
cancel
the
remembrance
that
Mr.
*NL*
Sparsit
was
a
Powler
,
or
that
I
myself
am
related
to
the
Scadgers
family
;
*NL*
or
if
I
could
even
revoke
the
fact
,
and
make
myself
a
person
of
common
*NL*
descent
and
ordinary
connexions
;
I
would
gladly
do
so
.
I
should
think
*NL*
it
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
right
to
do
so
.
'
The
same
Hermitical
*NL*
state
of
mind
led
to
her
renunciation
of
made
dishes
and
wines
at
dinner
,
*NL*
until
fairly
commanded
by
Mr.
Bounderby
to
take
them
;
when
she
said
,
*NL*
`
Indeed
you
are
very
good
,
sir
;
'
and
departed
from
a
resolution
of
which
*NL*
she
had
made
rather
formal
and
public
announcement
,
to
`
wait
for
the
*NL*
simple
mutton
.
'
She
was
likewise
deeply
apologetic
for
wanting
the
salt
;
*NL*
and
,
feeling
amiably
bound
to
bear
out
Mr.
Bounderby
to
the
fullest
*NL*
extent
in
the
testimony
he
had
borne
to
her
nerves
,
occasionally
sat
back
*NL*
in
her
chair
and
silently
wept
;
at
which
periods
a
tear
of
large
*NL*
dimensions
,
like
a
crystal
ear-ring
,
might
be
observed
-LRB-
or
rather
,
must
*NL*
be
,
for
it
insisted
on
public
notice
-RRB-
sliding
down
her
Roman
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
greatest
point
,
first
and
last
,
was
her
determination
*NL*
to
pity
Mr.
Bounderby
.
There
were
occasions
when
in
looking
at
him
she
*NL*
was
involuntarily
moved
to
shake
her
head
,
as
who
would
say
,
`
Alas
,
poor
*NL*
Yorick
!
'
After
allowing
herself
to
be
betrayed
into
these
evidences
of
*NL*
emotion
,
she
would
force
a
lambent
brightness
,
and
would
be
fitfully
*NL*
cheerful
,
and
would
say
,
`
You
have
still
good
spirits
,
sir
,
I
am
thankful
*NL*
to
find
;
'
and
would
appear
to
hail
it
as
a
blessed
dispensation
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
bore
up
as
he
did
.
One
idiosyncrasy
for
which
she
often
*NL*
apologized
,
she
found
it
excessively
difficult
to
conquer
.
She
had
a
*NL*
curious
propensity
to
call
Mrs.
Bounderby
`
Miss
Gradgrind
,
'
and
yielded
*NL*
to
it
some
three
or
four
score
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
Her
*NL*
repetition
of
this
mistake
covered
Mrs.
Sparsit
with
modest
confusion
;
*NL*
but
indeed
,
she
said
,
it
seemed
so
natural
to
say
Miss
Gradgrind
:
*NL*
whereas
,
to
persuade
herself
that
the
young
lady
whom
she
had
had
the
*NL*
happiness
of
knowing
from
a
child
could
be
really
and
truly
Mrs.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
she
found
almost
impossible
.
It
was
a
further
singularity
of
*NL*
this
remarkable
case
,
that
the
more
she
thought
about
it
,
the
more
*NL*
impossible
it
appeared
;
`
the
differences
,
'
she
observed
,
`
being
such
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drawing-room
after
dinner
,
Mr.
Bounderby
tried
the
case
of
the
*NL*
robbery
,
examined
the
witnesses
,
made
notes
of
the
evidence
,
found
the
*NL*
suspected
persons
guilty
,
and
sentenced
them
to
the
extreme
punishment
of
*NL*
the
law
.
That
done
,
Bitzer
was
dismissed
to
town
with
instructions
to
*NL*
recommend
Tom
to
come
home
by
the
mail-train
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
candles
were
brought
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
murmured
,
`
Do
n't
be
low
,
sir
.
*NL*
Pray
let
me
see
you
cheerful
,
sir
,
as
I
used
to
do
.
'
Mr.
Bounderby
,
upon
*NL*
whom
these
consolations
had
begun
to
produce
the
effect
of
making
him
,
in
*NL*
a
bull-headed
blundering
way
,
sentimental
,
sighed
like
some
large
*NL*
sea-animal
.
'
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
Try
*NL*
a
hand
at
backgammon
,
sir
,
as
you
used
to
do
when
I
had
the
honour
of
*NL*
living
under
your
roof
.
'
'
I
have
n't
played
backgammon
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
`
since
that
time
.
'
`
No
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
soothingly
,
*NL*
'
I
am
aware
that
you
have
not
.
I
remember
that
Miss
Gradgrind
takes
no
*NL*
interest
in
the
game
.
But
I
shall
be
happy
,
sir
,
if
you
will
*NL*
condescend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
played
near
a
window
,
opening
on
the
garden
.
It
was
a
fine
night
:
*NL*
not
moonlight
,
but
sultry
and
fragrant
.
Louisa
and
Mr.
Harthouse
*NL*
strolled
out
into
the
garden
,
where
their
voices
could
be
heard
in
the
*NL*
stillness
,
though
not
what
they
said
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
from
her
place
at
*NL*
the
backgammon
board
,
was
constantly
straining
her
eyes
to
pierce
the
*NL*
shadows
without
.
`
What
's
the
matter
,
ma'am
?
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
;
`
you
*NL*
do
n't
see
a
Fire
,
do
you
?
'
`
Oh
dear
no
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
'
I
*NL*
was
thinking
of
the
dew
.
'
`
What
have
you
got
to
do
with
the
dew
,
ma'am
?
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
It
's
not
myself
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
'
I
am
*NL*
fearful
of
Miss
Gradgrind
's
taking
cold
.
'
`
She
never
takes
cold
,
'
said
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
Really
,
sir
?
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
And
was
affected
with
*NL*
a
cough
in
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
time
drew
near
for
retiring
,
Mr.
Bounderby
took
a
glass
of
*NL*
water
.
`
Oh
,
sir
?
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
Not
your
sherry
warm
,
with
*NL*
lemon-peel
and
nutmeg
?
'
`
Why
,
I
have
got
out
of
the
habit
of
taking
it
*NL*
now
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
The
more
's
the
pity
,
sir
,
'
returned
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
;
`
you
are
losing
all
your
good
old
habits
.
Cheer
up
,
sir
!
*NL*
If
Miss
Gradgrind
will
permit
me
,
I
will
offer
to
make
it
for
you
,
as
I
*NL*
have
often
done
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gradgrind
readily
permitting
Mrs.
Sparsit
to
do
anything
she
*NL*
pleased
,
that
considerate
lady
made
the
beverage
,
and
handed
it
to
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
.
`
It
will
do
you
good
,
sir
.
It
will
warm
your
heart
.
It
is
*NL*
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
,
and
ought
to
take
,
sir
.
'
And
when
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
said
,
`
Your
health
,
ma'am
!
'
she
answered
with
great
feeling
,
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
sir
.
The
same
to
you
,
and
happiness
also
.
'
Finally
,
she
*NL*
wished
him
good
night
,
with
great
pathos
;
and
Mr.
Bounderby
went
to
bed
,
*NL*
with
a
maudlin
persuasion
that
he
had
been
crossed
in
something
tender
,
*NL*
though
he
could
not
,
for
his
life
,
have
mentioned
what
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
after
Louisa
had
undressed
and
lain
down
,
she
watched
and
waited
for
*NL*
her
brother
's
coming
home
.
That
could
hardly
be
,
she
knew
,
until
an
hour
*NL*
past
midnight
;
but
in
the
country
silence
,
which
did
anything
but
calm
*NL*
the
trouble
of
her
thoughts
,
time
lagged
wearily
.
At
last
,
when
the
*NL*
darkness
and
stillness
had
seemed
for
hours
to
thicken
one
another
,
she
*NL*
heard
the
bell
at
the
gate
.
She
felt
as
though
she
would
have
been
glad
*NL*
that
it
rang
on
until
daylight
;
but
it
ceased
,
and
the
circles
of
its
*NL*
last
sound
spread
out
fainter
and
wider
in
the
air
,
and
all
was
dead
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
yet
some
quarter
of
an
hour
,
as
she
judged
.
Then
she
arose
,
*NL*
put
on
a
loose
robe
,
and
went
out
of
her
room
in
the
dark
,
and
up
the
*NL*
staircase
to
her
brother
's
room
.
His
door
being
shut
,
she
softly
opened
*NL*
it
and
spoke
to
him
,
approaching
his
bed
with
a
noiseless
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
kneeled
down
beside
it
,
passed
her
arm
over
his
neck
,
and
drew
his
*NL*
face
to
hers
.
She
knew
that
he
only
feigned
to
be
asleep
,
but
she
said
*NL*
nothing
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
by
and
by
as
if
he
were
just
then
awakened
,
and
asked
who
that
*NL*
was
,
and
what
was
the
matter
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tom
,
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
?
If
ever
you
loved
me
in
your
life
,
*NL*
and
have
anything
concealed
from
every
one
besides
,
tell
it
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
Loo
.
You
have
been
dreaming
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
brother
:
'
she
laid
her
head
down
on
his
pillow
,
and
her
hair
*NL*
flowed
over
him
as
if
she
would
hide
him
from
every
one
but
herself
:
`
is
*NL*
there
nothing
that
you
have
to
tell
me
?
Is
there
nothing
you
can
tell
me
*NL*
if
you
will
?
You
can
tell
me
nothing
that
will
change
me
.
O
Tom
,
tell
*NL*
me
the
truth
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
Loo
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
you
lie
here
alone
,
my
dear
,
in
the
melancholy
night
,
so
you
must
lie
*NL*
somewhere
one
night
,
when
even
I
,
if
I
am
living
then
,
shall
have
left
*NL*
you
.
As
I
am
here
beside
you
,
barefoot
,
unclothed
,
undistinguishable
in
*NL*
darkness
,
so
must
I
lie
through
all
the
night
of
my
decay
,
until
I
am
*NL*
dust
.
In
the
name
of
that
time
,
Tom
,
tell
me
the
truth
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
it
you
want
to
know
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
be
certain
;
'
in
the
energy
of
her
love
she
took
him
to
her
bosom
*NL*
as
if
he
were
a
child
;
`
that
I
will
not
reproach
you
.
You
may
be
certain
*NL*
that
I
will
be
compassionate
and
true
to
you
.
You
may
be
certain
that
I
*NL*
will
save
you
at
whatever
cost
.
O
Tom
,
have
you
nothing
to
tell
me
?
*NL*
Whisper
very
softly
.
Say
only
``
yes
,
''
and
I
shall
understand
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
ear
to
his
lips
,
but
he
remained
doggedly
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
word
,
Tom
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
can
I
say
Yes
,
or
how
can
I
say
No
,
when
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
?
*NL*
Loo
,
you
are
a
brave
,
kind
girl
,
worthy
I
begin
to
think
of
a
better
*NL*
brother
than
I
am
.
But
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
Go
to
bed
,
go
to
*NL*
bed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
tired
,
'
she
whispered
presently
,
more
in
her
usual
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
am
quite
tired
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
been
so
hurried
and
disturbed
to-day
.
Have
any
fresh
*NL*
discoveries
been
made
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
those
you
have
heard
of
,
from
--
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tom
,
have
you
said
to
any
one
that
we
made
a
visit
to
those
people
,
and
*NL*
that
we
saw
those
three
together
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
.
Did
n't
you
yourself
particularly
ask
me
to
keep
it
quiet
when
you
*NL*
asked
me
to
go
there
with
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
But
I
did
not
know
then
what
was
going
to
happen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
I
neither
.
How
could
I
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
quick
upon
her
with
this
retort
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ought
I
to
say
,
after
what
has
happened
,
'
said
his
sister
,
standing
by
*NL*
the
bed
--
she
had
gradually
withdrawn
herself
and
risen
,
`
that
I
made
that
*NL*
visit
?
Should
I
say
so
?
Must
I
say
so
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
Heavens
,
Loo
,
'
returned
her
brother
,
`
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
asking
my
advice
.
Say
what
you
like
.
If
you
keep
it
to
yourself
,
I
*NL*
shall
keep
it
to
_
my_self
.
If
you
disclose
it
,
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
dark
for
either
to
see
the
other
's
face
;
but
each
seemed
very
*NL*
attentive
,
and
to
consider
before
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tom
,
do
you
believe
the
man
I
gave
the
money
to
,
is
really
implicated
in
*NL*
this
crime
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
.
I
do
n't
see
why
he
should
n't
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
seemed
to
me
an
honest
man
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Another
person
may
seem
to
you
dishonest
,
and
yet
not
be
so
.
'
There
was
*NL*
a
pause
,
for
he
had
hesitated
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
short
,
'
resumed
Tom
,
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
,
`
if
you
come
to
*NL*
that
,
perhaps
I
was
so
far
from
being
altogether
in
his
favour
,
that
I
*NL*
took
him
outside
the
door
to
tell
him
quietly
,
that
I
thought
he
might
*NL*
consider
himself
very
well
off
to
get
such
a
windfall
as
he
had
got
from
*NL*
my
sister
,
and
that
I
hoped
he
would
make
good
use
of
it
.
You
remember
*NL*
whether
I
took
him
out
or
not
.
I
say
nothing
against
the
man
;
he
may
be
*NL*
a
very
good
fellow
,
for
anything
I
know
;
I
hope
he
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Was
he
offended
by
what
you
said
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
he
took
it
pretty
well
;
he
was
civil
enough
.
Where
are
you
,
Loo
?
'
*NL*
He
sat
up
in
bed
and
kissed
her
.
`
Good
night
,
my
dear
,
good
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
nothing
more
to
tell
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
.
What
should
I
have
?
You
would
n't
have
me
tell
you
a
lie
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
would
n't
have
you
do
that
to-night
,
Tom
,
of
all
the
nights
in
your
*NL*
life
;
many
and
much
happier
as
I
hope
they
will
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
my
dear
Loo
.
I
am
so
tired
,
that
I
am
sure
I
wonder
I
do
n't
*NL*
say
anything
to
get
to
sleep
.
Go
to
bed
,
go
to
bed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Kissing
her
again
,
he
turned
round
,
drew
the
coverlet
over
his
head
,
and
*NL*
lay
as
still
as
if
that
time
had
come
by
which
she
had
adjured
him
.
She
*NL*
stood
for
some
time
at
the
bedside
before
she
slowly
moved
away
.
She
*NL*
stopped
at
the
door
,
looked
back
when
she
had
opened
it
,
and
asked
him
if
*NL*
he
had
called
her
?
But
he
lay
still
,
and
she
softly
closed
the
door
and
*NL*
returned
to
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
wretched
boy
looked
cautiously
up
and
found
her
gone
,
crept
out
*NL*
of
bed
,
fastened
his
door
,
and
threw
himself
upon
his
pillow
again
:
*NL*
tearing
his
hair
,
morosely
crying
,
grudgingly
loving
her
,
hatefully
but
*NL*
impenitently
spurning
himself
,
and
no
less
hatefully
and
unprofitably
*NL*
spurning
all
the
good
in
the
world
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
HEARING
THE
LAST
OF
IT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
SPARSIT
,
lying
by
to
recover
the
tone
of
her
nerves
in
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
's
retreat
,
kept
such
a
sharp
look-out
,
night
and
day
,
under
her
*NL*
Coriolanian
eyebrows
,
that
her
eyes
,
like
a
couple
of
lighthouses
on
an
*NL*
iron-bound
coast
,
might
have
warned
all
prudent
mariners
from
that
bold
*NL*
rock
her
Roman
nose
and
the
dark
and
craggy
region
in
its
neighbourhood
,
*NL*
but
for
the
placidity
of
her
manner
.
Although
it
was
hard
to
believe
*NL*
that
her
retiring
for
the
night
could
be
anything
but
a
form
,
so
severely
*NL*
wide
awake
were
those
classical
eyes
of
hers
,
and
so
impossible
did
it
*NL*
seem
that
her
rigid
nose
could
yield
to
any
relaxing
influence
,
yet
her
*NL*
manner
of
sitting
,
smoothing
her
uncomfortable
,
not
to
say
,
gritty
*NL*
mittens
-LRB-
they
were
constructed
of
a
cool
fabric
like
a
meat-safe
-RRB-
,
or
of
*NL*
ambling
to
unknown
places
of
destination
with
her
foot
in
her
cotton
*NL*
stirrup
,
was
so
perfectly
serene
,
that
most
observers
would
have
been
*NL*
constrained
to
suppose
her
a
dove
,
embodied
by
some
freak
of
nature
,
in
*NL*
the
earthly
tabernacle
of
a
bird
of
the
hook-beaked
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
most
wonderful
woman
for
prowling
about
the
house
.
How
she
got
*NL*
from
story
to
story
was
a
mystery
beyond
solution
.
A
lady
so
decorous
in
*NL*
herself
,
and
so
highly
connected
,
was
not
to
be
suspected
of
dropping
*NL*
over
the
banisters
or
sliding
down
them
,
yet
her
extraordinary
facility
*NL*
of
locomotion
suggested
the
wild
idea
.
Another
noticeable
circumstance
*NL*
in
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
,
that
she
was
never
hurried
.
She
would
shoot
with
*NL*
consummate
velocity
from
the
roof
to
the
hall
,
yet
would
be
in
full
*NL*
possession
of
her
breath
and
dignity
on
the
moment
of
her
arrival
there
.
*NL*
Neither
was
she
ever
seen
by
human
vision
to
go
at
a
great
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
very
kindly
to
Mr.
Harthouse
,
and
had
some
pleasant
conversation
*NL*
with
him
soon
after
her
arrival
.
She
made
him
her
stately
curtsey
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
one
morning
before
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
appears
but
yesterday
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
that
I
had
the
*NL*
honour
of
receiving
you
at
the
Bank
,
when
you
were
so
good
as
to
wish
to
*NL*
be
made
acquainted
with
Mr.
Bounderby
's
address
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
occasion
,
I
am
sure
,
not
to
be
forgotten
by
myself
in
the
course
of
*NL*
Ages
,
'
said
Mr.
Harthouse
,
inclining
his
head
to
Mrs.
Sparsit
with
the
*NL*
most
indolent
of
all
possible
airs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
live
in
a
singular
world
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
had
the
honour
,
by
a
coincidence
of
which
I
am
proud
,
to
have
*NL*
made
a
remark
,
similar
in
effect
,
though
not
so
epigrammatically
*NL*
expressed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
singular
world
,
I
would
say
,
sir
,
'
pursued
Mrs.
Sparsit
;
after
*NL*
acknowledging
the
compliment
with
a
drooping
of
her
dark
eyebrows
,
not
*NL*
altogether
so
mild
in
its
expression
as
her
voice
was
in
its
dulcet
*NL*
tones
;
`
as
regards
the
intimacies
we
form
at
one
time
,
with
individuals
*NL*
we
were
quite
ignorant
of
,
at
another
.
I
recall
,
sir
,
that
on
that
*NL*
occasion
you
went
so
far
as
to
say
you
were
actually
apprehensive
of
Miss
*NL*
Gradgrind
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
memory
does
me
more
honour
than
my
insignificance
deserves
.
I
*NL*
availed
myself
of
your
obliging
hints
to
correct
my
timidity
,
and
it
is
*NL*
unnecessary
to
add
that
they
were
perfectly
accurate
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
*NL*
talent
for
--
in
fact
for
anything
requiring
accuracy
--
with
a
combination
of
*NL*
strength
of
mind
--
and
Family
--
is
too
habitually
developed
to
admit
of
any
*NL*
question
.
'
He
was
almost
falling
asleep
over
this
compliment
;
it
took
*NL*
him
so
long
to
get
through
,
and
his
mind
wandered
so
much
in
the
course
*NL*
of
its
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
found
Miss
Gradgrind
--
I
really
can
not
call
her
Mrs.
Bounderby
;
it
's
*NL*
very
absurd
of
me
--
as
youthful
as
I
described
her
?
'
asked
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
*NL*
sweetly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
drew
her
portrait
perfectly
,
'
said
Mr.
Harthouse
.
`
Presented
her
*NL*
dead
image
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
engaging
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
causing
her
mittens
slowly
to
*NL*
revolve
over
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Highly
so
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
used
to
be
considered
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
that
Miss
Gradgrind
was
*NL*
wanting
in
animation
,
but
I
confess
she
appears
to
me
considerably
and
*NL*
strikingly
improved
in
that
respect
.
Ay
,
and
indeed
here
_
is
_
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
nodding
her
head
a
great
many
times
,
as
*NL*
if
she
had
been
talking
and
thinking
of
no
one
else
.
`
How
do
you
find
*NL*
yourself
this
morning
,
sir
?
Pray
let
us
see
you
cheerful
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
these
persistent
assuagements
of
his
misery
,
and
lightenings
of
his
*NL*
load
,
had
by
this
time
begun
to
have
the
effect
of
making
Mr.
Bounderby
*NL*
softer
than
usual
towards
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
and
harder
than
usual
to
most
*NL*
other
people
from
his
wife
downward
.
So
,
when
Mrs.
Sparsit
said
with
*NL*
forced
lightness
of
heart
,
`
You
want
your
breakfast
,
sir
,
but
I
dare
say
*NL*
Miss
Gradgrind
will
soon
be
here
to
preside
at
the
table
,
'
Mr.
Bounderby
*NL*
replied
,
`
If
I
waited
to
be
taken
care
of
by
my
wife
,
ma'am
,
I
believe
*NL*
you
know
pretty
well
I
should
wait
till
Doomsday
,
so
I
'll
trouble
_
you
_
*NL*
to
take
charge
of
the
teapot
.
'
Mrs.
Sparsit
complied
,
and
assumed
her
*NL*
old
position
at
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
again
made
the
excellent
woman
vastly
sentimental
.
She
was
so
*NL*
humble
withal
,
that
when
Louisa
appeared
,
she
rose
,
protesting
she
never
*NL*
could
think
of
sitting
in
that
place
under
existing
circumstances
,
often
*NL*
as
she
had
had
the
honour
of
making
Mr.
Bounderby
's
breakfast
,
before
*NL*
Mrs.
Gradgrind
--
she
begged
pardon
,
she
meant
to
say
Miss
Bounderby
--
she
*NL*
hoped
to
be
excused
,
but
she
really
could
not
get
it
right
yet
,
though
*NL*
she
trusted
to
become
familiar
with
it
by
and
by
--
had
assumed
her
present
*NL*
position
.
It
was
only
-LRB-
she
observed
-RRB-
because
Miss
Gradgrind
happened
to
*NL*
be
a
little
late
,
and
Mr.
Bounderby
's
time
was
so
very
precious
,
and
she
*NL*
knew
it
of
old
to
be
so
essential
that
he
should
breakfast
to
the
moment
,
*NL*
that
she
had
taken
the
liberty
of
complying
with
his
request
;
long
as
his
*NL*
will
had
been
a
law
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
!
Stop
where
you
are
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
stop
where
you
*NL*
are
!
Mrs.
Bounderby
will
be
very
glad
to
be
relieved
of
the
trouble
,
I
*NL*
believe
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
say
that
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
almost
with
severity
,
*NL*
`
because
that
is
very
unkind
to
Mrs.
Bounderby
.
And
to
be
unkind
is
not
*NL*
to
be
you
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
,
ma'am
.
--
You
can
take
it
very
quietly
,
*NL*
ca
n't
you
,
Loo
?
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
in
a
blustering
way
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
.
It
is
of
no
moment
.
Why
should
it
be
of
any
importance
to
*NL*
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
should
it
be
of
any
importance
to
any
one
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
ma'am
?
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
swelling
with
a
sense
of
slight
.
`
You
attach
too
*NL*
much
importance
to
these
things
,
ma'am
.
By
George
,
you
'll
be
corrupted
*NL*
in
some
of
your
notions
here
.
You
are
old-fashioned
,
ma'am
.
You
are
*NL*
behind
Tom
Gradgrind
's
children
's
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
the
matter
with
you
?
'
asked
Louisa
,
coldly
surprised
.
`
What
has
*NL*
given
you
offence
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Offence
!
'
repeated
Bounderby
.
`
Do
you
suppose
if
there
was
any
offence
*NL*
given
me
,
I
should
n't
name
it
,
and
request
to
have
it
corrected
?
I
am
a
*NL*
straightforward
man
,
I
believe
.
I
do
n't
go
beating
about
for
*NL*
side-winds
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
no
one
ever
had
occasion
to
think
you
too
diffident
,
or
too
*NL*
delicate
,
'
Louisa
answered
him
composedly
:
'
I
have
never
made
that
*NL*
objection
to
you
,
either
as
a
child
or
as
a
woman
.
I
do
n't
understand
*NL*
what
you
would
have
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
?
'
returned
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
Nothing
.
Otherwise
,
do
n't
you
,
Loo
*NL*
Bounderby
,
know
thoroughly
well
that
I
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
*NL*
would
have
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
as
he
struck
the
table
and
made
the
teacups
ring
,
with
*NL*
a
proud
colour
in
her
face
that
was
a
new
change
,
Mr.
Harthouse
thought
.
*NL*
`
You
are
incomprehensible
this
morning
,
'
said
Louisa
.
`
Pray
take
no
*NL*
further
trouble
to
explain
yourself
.
I
am
not
curious
to
know
your
*NL*
meaning
.
What
does
it
matter
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
more
was
said
on
this
theme
,
and
Mr.
Harthouse
was
soon
idly
gay
*NL*
on
indifferent
subjects
.
But
from
this
day
,
the
Sparsit
action
upon
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
threw
Louisa
and
James
Harthouse
more
together
,
and
*NL*
strengthened
the
dangerous
alienation
from
her
husband
and
confidence
*NL*
against
him
with
another
,
into
which
she
had
fallen
by
degrees
so
fine
*NL*
that
she
could
not
retrace
them
if
she
tried
.
But
whether
she
ever
tried
*NL*
or
no
,
lay
hidden
in
her
own
closed
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
so
much
affected
on
this
particular
occasion
,
that
,
*NL*
assisting
Mr.
Bounderby
to
his
hat
after
breakfast
,
and
being
then
alone
*NL*
with
him
in
the
hall
,
she
imprinted
a
chaste
kiss
upon
his
hand
,
murmured
*NL*
`
My
benefactor
!
'
and
retired
,
overwhelmed
with
grief
.
Yet
it
is
an
*NL*
indubitable
fact
,
within
the
cognizance
of
this
history
,
that
five
*NL*
minutes
after
he
had
left
the
house
in
the
self-same
hat
,
the
same
*NL*
descendant
of
the
Scadgerses
and
connexion
by
matrimony
of
the
Powlers
,
*NL*
shook
her
right-hand
mitten
at
his
portrait
,
made
a
contemptuous
grimace
*NL*
at
that
work
of
art
,
and
said
`
Serve
you
right
,
you
Noodle
,
and
I
am
glad
*NL*
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
had
not
been
long
gone
,
when
Bitzer
appeared
.
Bitzer
had
*NL*
come
down
by
train
,
shrieking
and
rattling
over
the
long
line
of
arches
*NL*
that
bestrode
the
wild
country
of
past
and
present
coal-pits
,
with
an
*NL*
express
from
Stone
Lodge
.
It
was
a
hasty
note
to
inform
Louisa
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Gradgrind
lay
very
ill
.
She
had
never
been
well
within
her
daughter
's
*NL*
knowledge
;
but
,
she
had
declined
within
the
last
few
days
,
had
continued
*NL*
sinking
all
through
the
night
,
and
was
now
as
nearly
dead
,
as
her
limited
*NL*
capacity
of
being
in
any
state
that
implied
the
ghost
of
an
intention
to
*NL*
get
out
of
it
,
allowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accompanied
by
the
lightest
of
porters
,
fit
colourless
servitor
at
*NL*
Death
's
door
when
Mrs.
Gradgrind
knocked
,
Louisa
rumbled
to
Coketown
,
*NL*
over
the
coal-pits
past
and
present
,
and
was
whirled
into
its
smoky
jaws
.
*NL*
She
dismissed
the
messenger
to
his
own
devices
,
and
rode
away
to
her
old
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
seldom
been
there
since
her
marriage
.
Her
father
was
usually
*NL*
sifting
and
sifting
at
his
parliamentary
cinder-heap
in
London
-LRB-
without
*NL*
being
observed
to
turn
up
many
precious
articles
among
the
rubbish
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
was
still
hard
at
it
in
the
national
dust-yard
.
Her
mother
had
taken
it
*NL*
rather
as
a
disturbance
than
otherwise
,
to
be
visited
,
as
she
reclined
*NL*
upon
her
sofa
;
young
people
,
Louisa
felt
herself
all
unfit
for
;
Sissy
she
*NL*
had
never
softened
to
again
,
since
the
night
when
the
stroller
's
child
*NL*
had
raised
her
eyes
to
look
at
Mr.
Bounderby
's
intended
wife
.
She
had
no
*NL*
inducements
to
go
back
,
and
had
rarely
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
,
as
she
approached
her
old
home
now
,
did
any
of
the
best
*NL*
influences
of
old
home
descend
upon
her
.
The
dreams
of
childhood
--
its
*NL*
airy
fables
;
its
graceful
,
beautiful
,
humane
,
impossible
adornments
of
*NL*
the
world
beyond
:
so
good
to
be
believed
in
once
,
so
good
to
be
*NL*
remembered
when
outgrown
,
for
then
the
least
among
them
rises
to
the
*NL*
stature
of
a
great
Charity
in
the
heart
,
suffering
little
children
to
*NL*
come
into
the
midst
of
it
,
and
to
keep
with
their
pure
hands
a
garden
in
*NL*
the
stony
ways
of
this
world
,
wherein
it
were
better
for
all
the
children
*NL*
of
Adam
that
they
should
oftener
sun
themselves
,
simple
and
trustful
,
and
*NL*
not
worldly-wise
--
what
had
she
to
do
with
these
?
Remembrances
of
how
she
*NL*
had
journeyed
to
the
little
that
she
knew
,
by
the
enchanted
roads
of
what
*NL*
she
and
millions
of
innocent
creatures
had
hoped
and
imagined
;
of
how
,
*NL*
first
coming
upon
Reason
through
the
tender
light
of
Fancy
,
she
had
seen
*NL*
it
a
beneficent
god
,
deferring
to
gods
as
great
as
itself
;
not
a
grim
*NL*
Idol
,
cruel
and
cold
,
with
its
victims
bound
hand
to
foot
,
and
its
big
*NL*
dumb
shape
set
up
with
a
sightless
stare
,
never
to
be
moved
by
anything
*NL*
but
so
many
calculated
tons
of
leverage
--
what
had
she
to
do
with
these
?
*NL*
Her
remembrances
of
home
and
childhood
were
remembrances
of
the
drying
up
*NL*
of
every
spring
and
fountain
in
her
young
heart
as
it
gushed
out
.
The
*NL*
golden
waters
were
not
there
.
They
were
flowing
for
the
fertilization
of
*NL*
the
land
where
grapes
are
gathered
from
thorns
,
and
figs
from
thistles
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
,
with
a
heavy
,
hardened
kind
of
sorrow
upon
her
,
into
the
house
*NL*
and
into
her
mother
's
room
.
Since
the
time
of
her
leaving
home
,
Sissy
*NL*
had
lived
with
the
rest
of
the
family
on
equal
terms
.
Sissy
was
at
her
*NL*
mother
's
side
;
and
Jane
,
her
sister
,
now
ten
or
twelve
years
old
,
was
in
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
great
trouble
before
it
could
be
made
known
to
Mrs.
Gradgrind
*NL*
that
her
eldest
child
was
there
.
She
reclined
,
propped
up
,
from
mere
*NL*
habit
,
on
a
couch
:
as
nearly
in
her
old
usual
attitude
,
as
anything
so
*NL*
helpless
could
be
kept
in
.
She
had
positively
refused
to
take
to
her
*NL*
bed
;
on
the
ground
that
if
she
did
,
she
would
never
hear
the
last
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
feeble
voice
sounded
so
far
away
in
her
bundle
of
shawls
,
and
the
*NL*
sound
of
another
voice
addressing
her
seemed
to
take
such
a
long
time
in
*NL*
getting
down
to
her
ears
,
that
she
might
have
been
lying
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
a
well
.
The
poor
lady
was
nearer
Truth
than
she
ever
had
been
:
which
had
*NL*
much
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
being
told
that
Mrs.
Bounderby
was
there
,
she
replied
,
at
*NL*
cross-purposes
,
that
she
had
never
called
him
by
that
name
since
he
*NL*
married
Louisa
;
that
pending
her
choice
of
an
objectionable
name
,
she
had
*NL*
called
him
J
;
and
that
she
could
not
at
present
depart
from
that
*NL*
regulation
,
not
being
yet
provided
with
a
permanent
substitute
.
Louisa
*NL*
had
sat
by
her
for
some
minutes
,
and
had
spoken
to
her
often
,
before
she
*NL*
arrived
at
a
clear
understanding
who
it
was
.
She
then
seemed
to
come
to
*NL*
it
all
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
`
and
I
hope
you
are
going
on
*NL*
satisfactorily
to
yourself
.
It
was
all
your
father
's
doing
.
He
set
his
*NL*
heart
upon
it
.
And
he
ought
to
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
want
to
hear
of
you
,
mother
;
not
of
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
want
to
hear
of
me
,
my
dear
?
That
's
something
new
,
I
am
sure
,
when
*NL*
anybody
wants
to
hear
of
me
.
Not
at
all
well
,
Louisa
.
Very
faint
and
*NL*
giddy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
in
pain
,
dear
mother
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
there
's
a
pain
somewhere
in
the
room
,
'
said
Mrs.
Gradgrind
,
`
but
*NL*
I
could
n't
positively
say
that
I
have
got
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
strange
speech
,
she
lay
silent
for
some
time
.
Louisa
,
holding
*NL*
her
hand
,
could
feel
no
pulse
;
but
kissing
it
,
could
see
a
slight
thin
*NL*
thread
of
life
in
fluttering
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
very
seldom
see
your
sister
,
'
said
Mrs.
Gradgrind
.
`
She
grows
like
*NL*
you
.
I
wish
you
would
look
at
her
.
Sissy
,
bring
her
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
brought
,
and
stood
with
her
hand
in
her
sister
's
.
Louisa
had
*NL*
observed
her
with
her
arm
round
Sissy
's
neck
,
and
she
felt
the
difference
*NL*
of
this
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
see
the
likeness
,
Louisa
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
mother
.
I
should
think
her
like
me
.
But
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Eh
!
Yes
,
I
always
say
so
,
'
Mrs.
Gradgrind
cried
,
with
unexpected
*NL*
quickness
.
`
And
that
reminds
me
.
I
--
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
my
dear
.
*NL*
Sissy
,
my
good
girl
,
leave
us
alone
a
minute
.
'
Louisa
had
relinquished
*NL*
the
hand
:
had
thought
that
her
sister
's
was
a
better
and
brighter
face
*NL*
than
hers
had
ever
been
:
had
seen
in
it
,
not
without
a
rising
feeling
of
*NL*
resentment
,
even
in
that
place
and
at
that
time
,
something
of
the
*NL*
gentleness
of
the
other
face
in
the
room
;
the
sweet
face
with
the
*NL*
trusting
eyes
,
made
paler
than
watching
and
sympathy
made
it
,
by
the
rich
*NL*
dark
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
with
her
mother
,
Louisa
saw
her
lying
with
an
awful
lull
upon
*NL*
her
face
,
like
one
who
was
floating
away
upon
some
great
water
,
all
*NL*
resistance
over
,
content
to
be
carried
down
the
stream
.
She
put
the
*NL*
shadow
of
a
hand
to
her
lips
again
,
and
recalled
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
were
going
to
speak
to
me
,
mother
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Eh
?
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
my
dear
.
You
know
your
father
is
almost
always
*NL*
away
now
,
and
therefore
I
must
write
to
him
about
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
what
,
mother
?
Do
n't
be
troubled
.
About
what
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
remember
,
my
dear
,
that
whenever
I
have
said
anything
,
on
any
*NL*
subject
,
I
have
never
heard
the
last
of
it
:
and
consequently
,
that
I
have
*NL*
long
left
off
saying
anything
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
hear
you
,
mother
.
'
But
,
it
was
only
by
dint
of
bending
down
to
*NL*
her
ear
,
and
at
the
same
time
attentively
watching
the
lips
as
they
*NL*
moved
,
that
she
could
link
such
faint
and
broken
sounds
into
any
chain
of
*NL*
connexion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
learnt
a
great
deal
,
Louisa
,
and
so
did
your
brother
.
Ologies
of
*NL*
all
kinds
from
morning
to
night
.
If
there
is
any
Ology
left
,
of
any
*NL*
description
,
that
has
not
been
worn
to
rags
in
this
house
,
all
I
can
say
*NL*
is
,
I
hope
I
shall
never
hear
its
name
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
hear
you
,
mother
,
when
you
have
strength
to
go
on
.
'
This
,
to
keep
*NL*
her
from
floating
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
there
is
something
--
not
an
Ology
at
all
--
that
your
father
has
missed
,
*NL*
or
forgotten
,
Louisa
.
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
I
have
often
sat
with
*NL*
Sissy
near
me
,
and
thought
about
it
.
I
shall
never
get
its
name
now
.
*NL*
But
your
father
may
.
It
makes
me
restless
.
I
want
to
write
to
him
,
to
*NL*
find
out
for
God
's
sake
,
what
it
is
.
Give
me
a
pen
,
give
me
a
pen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
power
of
restlessness
was
gone
,
except
from
the
poor
head
,
which
*NL*
could
just
turn
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fancied
,
however
,
that
her
request
had
been
complied
with
,
and
that
*NL*
the
pen
she
could
not
have
held
was
in
her
hand
.
It
matters
little
what
*NL*
figures
of
wonderful
no-meaning
she
began
to
trace
upon
her
wrappers
.
*NL*
The
hand
soon
stopped
in
the
midst
of
them
;
the
light
that
had
always
*NL*
been
feeble
and
dim
behind
the
weak
transparency
,
went
out
;
and
even
Mrs.
*NL*
Gradgrind
,
emerged
from
the
shadow
in
which
man
walketh
and
disquieteth
*NL*
himself
in
vain
,
took
upon
her
the
dread
solemnity
of
the
sages
and
*NL*
patriarchs
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
MRS.
SPARSIT
'S
STAIRCASE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MRS.
SPARSIT
'S
nerves
being
slow
to
recover
their
tone
,
the
worthy
woman
*NL*
made
a
stay
of
some
weeks
in
duration
at
Mr.
Bounderby
's
retreat
,
where
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
her
anchorite
turn
of
mind
based
upon
her
becoming
*NL*
consciousness
of
her
altered
station
,
she
resigned
herself
with
noble
*NL*
fortitude
to
lodging
,
as
one
may
say
,
in
clover
,
and
feeding
on
the
fat
*NL*
of
the
land
.
During
the
whole
term
of
this
recess
from
the
guardianship
*NL*
of
the
Bank
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
a
pattern
of
consistency
;
continuing
to
*NL*
take
such
pity
on
Mr.
Bounderby
to
his
face
,
as
is
rarely
taken
on
man
,
*NL*
and
to
call
his
portrait
a
Noodle
to
_
its
_
face
,
with
the
greatest
*NL*
acrimony
and
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
having
got
it
into
his
explosive
composition
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
was
a
highly
superior
woman
to
perceive
that
he
had
that
general
*NL*
cross
upon
him
in
his
deserts
-LRB-
for
he
had
not
yet
settled
what
it
was
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
further
that
Louisa
would
have
objected
to
her
as
a
frequent
visitor
*NL*
if
it
had
comported
with
his
greatness
that
she
should
object
to
anything
*NL*
he
chose
to
do
,
resolved
not
to
lose
sight
of
Mrs.
Sparsit
easily
.
So
*NL*
when
her
nerves
were
strung
up
to
the
pitch
of
again
consuming
*NL*
sweetbreads
in
solitude
,
he
said
to
her
at
the
dinner-table
,
on
the
day
*NL*
before
her
departure
,
'
I
tell
you
what
,
ma'am
;
you
shall
come
down
here
*NL*
of
a
Saturday
,
while
the
fine
weather
lasts
,
and
stay
till
Monday
.
'
To
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Sparsit
returned
,
in
effect
,
though
not
of
the
Mahomedan
*NL*
persuasion
:
`
To
hear
is
to
obey
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
not
a
poetical
woman
;
but
she
took
an
idea
in
the
*NL*
nature
of
an
allegorical
fancy
,
into
her
head
.
Much
watching
of
Louisa
,
*NL*
and
much
consequent
observation
of
her
impenetrable
demeanour
,
which
*NL*
keenly
whetted
and
sharpened
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
edge
,
must
have
given
her
as
*NL*
it
were
a
lift
,
in
the
way
of
inspiration
.
She
erected
in
her
mind
a
*NL*
mighty
Staircase
,
with
a
dark
pit
of
shame
and
ruin
at
the
bottom
;
and
*NL*
down
those
stairs
,
from
day
to
day
and
hour
to
hour
,
she
saw
Louisa
*NL*
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
became
the
business
of
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
life
,
to
look
up
at
her
*NL*
staircase
,
and
to
watch
Louisa
coming
down
.
Sometimes
slowly
,
sometimes
*NL*
quickly
,
sometimes
several
steps
at
one
bout
,
sometimes
stopping
,
never
*NL*
turning
back
.
If
she
had
once
turned
back
,
it
might
have
been
the
death
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Sparsit
in
spleen
and
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
descending
steadily
,
to
the
day
,
and
on
the
day
,
when
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
issued
the
weekly
invitation
recorded
above
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
*NL*
in
good
spirits
,
and
inclined
to
be
conversational
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
pray
,
sir
,
'
said
she
,
`
if
I
may
venture
to
ask
a
question
*NL*
appertaining
to
any
subject
on
which
you
show
reserve
--
which
is
indeed
*NL*
hardy
in
me
,
for
I
well
know
you
have
a
reason
for
everything
you
do
--
have
*NL*
you
received
intelligence
respecting
the
robbery
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
ma'am
,
no
;
not
yet
.
Under
the
circumstances
,
I
did
n't
expect
it
*NL*
yet
.
Rome
was
n't
built
in
a
day
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
true
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
yet
in
a
week
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
a
gentle
melancholy
upon
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
a
similar
manner
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
'
I
can
wait
,
you
know
.
If
*NL*
Romulus
and
Remus
could
wait
,
Josiah
Bounderby
can
wait
.
They
were
*NL*
better
off
in
their
youth
than
I
was
,
however
.
They
had
a
she-wolf
for
a
*NL*
nurse
;
I
had
only
a
she-wolf
for
a
grandmother
.
She
did
n't
give
any
*NL*
milk
,
ma'am
;
she
gave
bruises
.
She
was
a
regular
Alderney
at
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
'
Mrs.
Sparsit
sighed
and
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
ma'am
,
'
continued
Bounderby
,
'
I
have
not
heard
anything
more
about
*NL*
it
.
It
's
in
hand
,
though
;
and
young
Tom
,
who
rather
sticks
to
business
*NL*
at
present
--
something
new
for
him
;
he
had
n't
the
schooling
_
I
_
had
--
is
*NL*
helping
.
My
injunction
is
,
Keep
it
quiet
,
and
let
it
seem
to
blow
over
.
*NL*
Do
what
you
like
under
the
rose
,
but
do
n't
give
a
sign
of
what
you
're
*NL*
about
;
or
half
a
hundred
of
'em
will
combine
together
and
get
this
fellow
*NL*
who
has
bolted
,
out
of
reach
for
good
.
Keep
it
quiet
,
and
the
thieves
*NL*
will
grow
in
confidence
by
little
and
little
,
and
we
shall
have
'em
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
sagacious
indeed
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
Very
interesting
.
The
*NL*
old
woman
you
mentioned
,
sir
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
old
woman
I
mentioned
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
cutting
the
matter
*NL*
short
,
as
it
was
nothing
to
boast
about
,
`
is
not
laid
hold
of
;
but
,
she
*NL*
may
take
her
oath
she
will
be
,
if
that
is
any
satisfaction
to
her
*NL*
villainous
old
mind
.
In
the
mean
time
,
ma'am
,
I
am
of
opinion
,
if
you
*NL*
ask
me
my
opinion
,
that
the
less
she
is
talked
about
,
the
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
evening
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
in
her
chamber
window
,
resting
from
her
*NL*
packing
operations
,
looked
towards
her
great
staircase
and
saw
Louisa
*NL*
still
descending
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
by
Mr.
Harthouse
,
in
an
alcove
in
the
garden
,
talking
very
low
;
*NL*
he
stood
leaning
over
her
,
as
they
whispered
together
,
and
his
face
*NL*
almost
touched
her
hair
.
`
If
not
quite
!
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
straining
*NL*
her
hawk
's
eyes
to
the
utmost
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
too
distant
to
hear
a
*NL*
word
of
their
discourse
,
or
even
to
know
that
they
were
speaking
softly
,
*NL*
otherwise
than
from
the
expression
of
their
figures
;
but
what
they
said
*NL*
was
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
recollect
the
man
,
Mr.
Harthouse
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
perfectly
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
face
,
and
his
manner
,
and
what
he
said
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perfectly
.
And
an
infinitely
dreary
person
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
.
*NL*
Lengthy
and
prosy
in
the
extreme
.
It
was
knowing
to
hold
forth
,
in
the
*NL*
humble-virtue
school
of
eloquence
;
but
,
I
assure
you
I
thought
at
the
*NL*
time
,
``
My
good
fellow
,
you
are
over-doing
this
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
has
been
very
difficult
to
me
to
think
ill
of
that
man
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Louisa
--
as
Tom
says
.
'
Which
he
never
did
say
.
`
You
know
no
good
*NL*
of
the
fellow
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
certainly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
of
any
other
such
person
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
can
I
,
'
she
returned
,
with
more
of
her
first
manner
on
her
than
he
*NL*
had
lately
seen
,
`
when
I
know
nothing
of
them
,
men
or
women
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Louisa
,
then
consent
to
receive
the
submissive
representation
of
*NL*
your
devoted
friend
,
who
knows
something
of
several
varieties
of
his
*NL*
excellent
fellow-creatures
--
for
excellent
they
are
,
I
am
quite
ready
to
*NL*
believe
,
in
spite
of
such
little
foibles
as
always
helping
themselves
to
*NL*
what
they
can
get
hold
of
.
This
fellow
talks
.
Well
;
every
fellow
talks
.
*NL*
He
professes
morality
.
Well
;
all
sorts
of
humbugs
profess
morality
.
*NL*
From
the
House
of
Commons
to
the
House
of
Correction
,
there
is
a
general
*NL*
profession
of
morality
,
except
among
our
people
;
it
really
is
that
*NL*
exception
which
makes
our
people
quite
reviving
.
You
saw
and
heard
the
*NL*
case
.
Here
was
one
of
the
fluffy
classes
pulled
up
extremely
short
by
my
*NL*
esteemed
friend
Mr.
Bounderby
--
who
,
as
we
know
,
is
not
possessed
of
that
*NL*
delicacy
which
would
soften
so
tight
a
hand
.
The
member
of
the
fluffy
*NL*
classes
was
injured
,
exasperated
,
left
the
house
grumbling
,
met
somebody
*NL*
who
proposed
to
him
to
go
in
for
some
share
in
this
Bank
business
,
went
*NL*
in
,
put
something
in
his
pocket
which
had
nothing
in
it
before
,
and
*NL*
relieved
his
mind
extremely
.
Really
he
would
have
been
an
uncommon
,
*NL*
instead
of
a
common
,
fellow
,
if
he
had
not
availed
himself
of
such
an
*NL*
opportunity
.
Or
he
may
have
originated
it
altogether
,
if
he
had
the
*NL*
cleverness
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
almost
feel
as
though
it
must
be
bad
in
me
,
'
returned
Louisa
,
after
*NL*
sitting
thoughtful
awhile
,
`
to
be
so
ready
to
agree
with
you
,
and
to
be
*NL*
so
lightened
in
my
heart
by
what
you
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
only
say
what
is
reasonable
;
nothing
worse
.
I
have
talked
it
over
*NL*
with
my
friend
Tom
more
than
once
--
of
course
I
remain
on
terms
of
perfect
*NL*
confidence
with
Tom
--
and
he
is
quite
of
my
opinion
,
and
I
am
quite
of
his
.
*NL*
Will
you
walk
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
strolled
away
,
among
the
lanes
beginning
to
be
indistinct
in
the
*NL*
twilight
--
she
leaning
on
his
arm
--
and
she
little
thought
how
she
was
going
*NL*
down
,
down
,
down
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
and
day
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
kept
it
standing
.
When
Louisa
had
arrived
at
*NL*
the
bottom
and
disappeared
in
the
gulf
,
it
might
fall
in
upon
her
if
it
*NL*
would
;
but
,
until
then
,
there
it
was
to
be
,
a
Building
,
before
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
's
eyes
.
And
there
Louisa
always
was
,
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
always
gliding
down
,
down
,
down
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
saw
James
Harthouse
come
and
go
;
she
heard
of
him
here
and
*NL*
there
;
she
saw
the
changes
of
the
face
he
had
studied
;
she
,
too
,
remarked
*NL*
to
a
nicety
how
and
when
it
clouded
,
how
and
when
it
cleared
;
she
kept
*NL*
her
black
eyes
wide
open
,
with
no
touch
of
pity
,
with
no
touch
of
*NL*
compunction
,
all
absorbed
in
interest
.
In
the
interest
of
seeing
her
,
*NL*
ever
drawing
,
with
no
hand
to
stay
her
,
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
bottom
*NL*
of
this
new
Giant
's
Staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
her
deference
for
Mr.
Bounderby
as
contradistinguished
from
his
*NL*
portrait
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
interrupting
the
*NL*
descent
.
Eager
to
see
it
accomplished
,
and
yet
patient
,
she
waited
for
*NL*
the
last
fall
,
as
for
the
ripeness
and
fulness
of
the
harvest
of
her
*NL*
hopes
.
Hushed
in
expectancy
,
she
kept
her
wary
gaze
upon
the
stairs
;
and
*NL*
seldom
so
much
as
darkly
shook
her
right
mitten
-LRB-
with
her
fist
in
it
-RRB-
,
at
*NL*
the
figure
coming
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
LOWER
AND
LOWER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
figure
descended
the
great
stairs
,
steadily
,
steadily
;
always
*NL*
verging
,
like
a
weight
in
deep
water
,
to
the
black
gulf
at
the
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
apprised
of
his
wife
's
decease
,
made
an
expedition
from
*NL*
London
,
and
buried
her
in
a
business-like
manner
.
He
then
returned
with
*NL*
promptitude
to
the
national
cinder-heap
,
and
resumed
his
sifting
for
the
*NL*
odds
and
ends
he
wanted
,
and
his
throwing
of
the
dust
about
into
the
eyes
*NL*
of
other
people
who
wanted
other
odds
and
ends
--
in
fact
resumed
his
*NL*
parliamentary
duties
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
kept
unwinking
watch
and
ward
.
Separated
*NL*
from
her
staircase
,
all
the
week
,
by
the
length
of
iron
road
dividing
*NL*
Coketown
from
the
country
house
,
she
yet
maintained
her
cat-like
*NL*
observation
of
Louisa
,
through
her
husband
,
through
her
brother
,
through
*NL*
James
Harthouse
,
through
the
outsides
of
letters
and
packets
,
through
*NL*
everything
animate
and
inanimate
that
at
any
time
went
near
the
stairs
.
*NL*
`
Your
foot
on
the
last
step
,
my
lady
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
apostrophizing
*NL*
the
descending
figure
,
with
the
aid
of
her
threatening
mitten
,
`
and
all
*NL*
your
art
shall
never
blind
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Art
or
nature
though
,
the
original
stock
of
Louisa
's
character
or
the
*NL*
graft
of
circumstances
upon
it
,
--
her
curious
reserve
did
baffle
,
while
it
*NL*
stimulated
,
one
as
sagacious
as
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
There
were
times
when
Mr.
*NL*
James
Harthouse
was
not
sure
of
her
.
There
were
times
when
he
could
not
*NL*
read
the
face
he
had
studied
so
long
;
and
when
this
lonely
girl
was
a
*NL*
greater
mystery
to
him
,
than
any
woman
of
the
world
with
a
ring
of
*NL*
satellites
to
help
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
time
went
on
;
until
it
happened
that
Mr.
Bounderby
was
called
away
*NL*
from
home
by
business
which
required
his
presence
elsewhere
,
for
three
or
*NL*
four
days
.
It
was
on
a
Friday
that
he
intimated
this
to
Mrs.
Sparsit
at
*NL*
the
Bank
,
adding
:
`
But
you
'll
go
down
to-morrow
,
ma'am
,
all
the
same
.
*NL*
You
'll
go
down
just
as
if
I
was
there
.
It
will
make
no
difference
to
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pray
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
reproachfully
,
`
let
me
beg
you
not
to
*NL*
say
that
.
Your
absence
will
make
a
vast
difference
to
me
,
sir
,
as
I
*NL*
think
you
very
well
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
ma'am
,
then
you
must
get
on
in
my
absence
as
well
as
you
can
,
'
*NL*
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
not
displeased
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Bounderby
,
'
retorted
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
your
will
is
to
me
a
law
,
sir
;
*NL*
otherwise
,
it
might
be
my
inclination
to
dispute
your
kind
commands
,
not
*NL*
feeling
sure
that
it
will
be
quite
so
agreeable
to
Miss
Gradgrind
to
*NL*
receive
me
,
as
it
ever
is
to
your
own
munificent
hospitality
.
But
you
*NL*
shall
say
no
more
,
sir
.
I
will
go
,
upon
your
invitation
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
when
I
invite
you
to
my
house
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
opening
his
*NL*
eyes
,
'
I
should
hope
you
want
no
other
invitation
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
'
I
should
hope
not
.
Say
no
*NL*
more
,
sir
.
I
would
,
sir
,
I
could
see
you
gay
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
,
ma'am
?
'
blustered
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
rejoined
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
there
was
wont
to
be
an
elasticity
in
you
*NL*
which
I
sadly
miss
.
Be
buoyant
,
sir
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
under
the
influence
of
this
difficult
adjuration
,
backed
*NL*
up
by
her
compassionate
eye
,
could
only
scratch
his
head
in
a
feeble
and
*NL*
ridiculous
manner
,
and
afterwards
assert
himself
at
a
distance
,
by
being
*NL*
heard
to
bully
the
small
fry
of
business
all
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bitzer
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
that
afternoon
,
when
her
patron
was
gone
on
*NL*
his
journey
,
and
the
Bank
was
closing
,
`
present
my
compliments
to
young
*NL*
Mr.
Thomas
,
and
ask
him
if
he
would
step
up
and
partake
of
a
lamb
chop
*NL*
and
walnut
ketchup
,
with
a
glass
of
India
ale
?
'
Young
Mr.
Thomas
being
*NL*
usually
ready
for
anything
in
that
way
,
returned
a
gracious
answer
,
and
*NL*
followed
on
its
heels
.
`
Mr.
Thomas
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
these
plain
*NL*
viands
being
on
table
,
I
thought
you
might
be
tempted
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
`
ee
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
'
said
the
whelp
.
And
gloomily
fell
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
is
Mr.
Harthouse
,
Mr.
Tom
?
'
asked
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
he
's
all
right
,
'
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
may
he
be
at
present
?
'
Mrs.
Sparsit
asked
in
a
light
*NL*
conversational
manner
,
after
mentally
devoting
the
whelp
to
the
Furies
*NL*
for
being
so
uncommunicative
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
shooting
in
Yorkshire
,
'
said
Tom
.
`
Sent
Loo
a
basket
half
as
big
*NL*
as
a
church
,
yesterday
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
kind
of
gentleman
,
now
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
sweetly
,
`
whom
one
might
*NL*
wager
to
be
a
good
shot
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Crack
,
'
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
long
been
a
down-looking
young
fellow
,
but
this
characteristic
had
*NL*
so
increased
of
late
,
that
he
never
raised
his
eyes
to
any
face
for
three
*NL*
seconds
together
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
consequently
had
ample
means
of
watching
*NL*
his
looks
,
if
she
were
so
inclined
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Harthouse
is
a
great
favourite
of
mine
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
as
*NL*
indeed
he
is
of
most
people
.
May
we
expect
to
see
him
again
shortly
,
Mr.
*NL*
Tom
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
_
I
_
expect
to
see
him
to-morrow
,
'
returned
the
whelp
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
news
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
blandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
got
an
appointment
with
him
to
meet
him
in
the
evening
at
the
*NL*
station
here
,
'
said
Tom
,
`
and
I
am
going
to
dine
with
him
afterwards
,
I
*NL*
believe
.
He
is
not
coming
down
to
the
country
house
for
a
week
or
so
,
*NL*
being
due
somewhere
else
.
At
least
,
he
says
so
;
but
I
should
n't
wonder
*NL*
if
he
was
to
stop
here
over
Sunday
,
and
stray
that
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Which
reminds
me
!
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
Would
you
remember
a
message
to
*NL*
your
sister
,
Mr.
Tom
,
if
I
was
to
charge
you
with
one
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
?
I
'll
try
,
'
returned
the
reluctant
whelp
,
`
if
it
is
n't
a
long
un
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
merely
my
respectful
compliments
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
and
I
fear
*NL*
I
may
not
trouble
her
with
my
society
this
week
;
being
still
a
little
*NL*
nervous
,
and
better
perhaps
by
my
poor
self
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
If
that
's
all
,
'
observed
Tom
,
`
it
would
n't
much
matter
,
even
if
I
*NL*
was
to
forget
it
,
for
Loo
's
not
likely
to
think
of
you
unless
she
sees
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Having
paid
for
his
entertainment
with
this
agreeable
compliment
,
he
*NL*
relapsed
into
a
hangdog
silence
until
there
was
no
more
India
ale
left
,
*NL*
when
he
said
,
`
Well
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
I
must
be
off
!
'
and
went
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
Saturday
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
sat
at
her
window
all
day
long
looking
*NL*
at
the
customers
coming
in
and
out
,
watching
the
postmen
,
keeping
an
eye
*NL*
on
the
general
traffic
of
the
street
,
revolving
many
things
in
her
mind
,
*NL*
but
,
above
all
,
keeping
her
attention
on
her
staircase
.
The
evening
*NL*
come
,
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
went
quietly
out
:
having
her
*NL*
reasons
for
hovering
in
a
furtive
way
about
the
station
by
which
a
*NL*
passenger
would
arrive
from
Yorkshire
,
and
for
preferring
to
peep
into
it
*NL*
round
pillars
and
corners
,
and
out
of
ladies
'
waiting-room
windows
,
to
*NL*
appearing
in
its
precincts
openly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
in
attendance
,
and
loitered
about
until
the
expected
train
came
*NL*
in
.
It
brought
no
Mr.
Harthouse
.
Tom
waited
until
the
crowd
had
*NL*
dispersed
,
and
the
bustle
was
over
;
and
then
referred
to
a
posted
list
of
*NL*
trains
,
and
took
counsel
with
porters
.
That
done
,
he
strolled
away
idly
,
*NL*
stopping
in
the
street
and
looking
up
it
and
down
it
,
and
lifting
his
hat
*NL*
off
and
putting
it
on
again
,
and
yawning
and
stretching
himself
,
and
*NL*
exhibiting
all
the
symptoms
of
mortal
weariness
to
be
expected
in
one
who
*NL*
had
still
to
wait
until
the
next
train
should
come
in
,
an
hour
and
forty
*NL*
minutes
hence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
a
device
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
*NL*
starting
from
the
dull
office
window
whence
she
had
watched
him
last
.
*NL*
`
Harthouse
is
with
his
sister
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
conception
of
an
inspired
moment
,
and
she
shot
off
with
her
*NL*
utmost
swiftness
to
work
it
out
.
The
station
for
the
country
house
was
*NL*
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
town
,
the
time
was
short
,
the
road
not
easy
;
*NL*
but
she
was
so
quick
in
pouncing
on
a
disengaged
coach
,
so
quick
in
*NL*
darting
out
of
it
,
producing
her
money
,
seizing
her
ticket
,
and
diving
*NL*
into
the
train
,
that
she
was
borne
along
the
arches
spanning
the
land
of
*NL*
coal-pits
past
and
present
,
as
if
she
had
been
caught
up
in
a
cloud
and
*NL*
whirled
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
journey
,
immovable
in
the
air
though
never
left
behind
;
plain
to
*NL*
the
dark
eyes
of
her
mind
,
as
the
electric
wires
which
ruled
a
colossal
*NL*
strip
of
music-paper
out
of
the
evening
sky
,
were
plain
to
the
dark
eyes
*NL*
of
her
body
;
Mrs.
Sparsit
saw
her
staircase
,
with
the
figure
coming
down
.
*NL*
Very
near
the
bottom
now
.
Upon
the
brink
of
the
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
overcast
September
evening
,
just
at
nightfall
,
saw
beneath
its
*NL*
drooping
eyelids
Mrs.
Sparsit
glide
out
of
her
carriage
,
pass
down
the
*NL*
wooden
steps
of
the
little
station
into
a
stony
road
,
cross
it
into
a
*NL*
green
lane
,
and
become
hidden
in
a
summer-growth
of
leaves
and
branches
.
*NL*
One
or
two
late
birds
sleepily
chirping
in
their
nests
,
and
a
bat
heavily
*NL*
crossing
and
recrossing
her
,
and
the
reek
of
her
own
tread
in
the
thick
*NL*
dust
that
felt
like
velvet
,
were
all
Mrs.
Sparsit
heard
or
saw
until
she
*NL*
very
softly
closed
a
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
up
to
the
house
,
keeping
within
the
shrubbery
,
and
went
round
*NL*
it
,
peeping
between
the
leaves
at
the
lower
windows
.
Most
of
them
were
*NL*
open
,
as
they
usually
were
in
such
warm
weather
,
but
there
were
no
lights
*NL*
yet
,
and
all
was
silent
.
She
tried
the
garden
with
no
better
effect
.
*NL*
She
thought
of
the
wood
,
and
stole
towards
it
,
heedless
of
long
grass
and
*NL*
briers
:
of
worms
,
snails
,
and
slugs
,
and
all
the
creeping
things
that
be
.
*NL*
With
her
dark
eyes
and
her
hook
nose
warily
in
advance
of
her
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
softly
crushed
her
way
through
the
thick
undergrowth
,
so
intent
*NL*
upon
her
object
that
she
probably
would
have
done
no
less
,
if
the
wood
*NL*
had
been
a
wood
of
adders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hark
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
smaller
birds
might
have
tumbled
out
of
their
nests
,
fascinated
by
*NL*
the
glittering
of
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
eyes
in
the
gloom
,
as
she
stopped
and
*NL*
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Low
voices
close
at
hand
.
His
voice
and
hers
.
The
appointment
_
was
_
a
*NL*
device
to
keep
the
brother
away
!
There
they
were
yonder
,
by
the
felled
*NL*
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bending
low
among
the
dewy
grass
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
advanced
closer
to
them
.
*NL*
She
drew
herself
up
,
and
stood
behind
a
tree
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
in
his
*NL*
ambuscade
against
the
savages
;
so
near
to
them
that
at
a
spring
,
and
that
*NL*
no
great
one
,
she
could
have
touched
them
both
.
He
was
there
secretly
,
*NL*
and
had
not
shown
himself
at
the
house
.
He
had
come
on
horseback
,
and
*NL*
must
have
passed
through
the
neighbouring
fields
;
for
his
horse
was
tied
*NL*
to
the
meadow
side
of
the
fence
,
within
a
few
paces
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dearest
love
,
'
said
he
,
`
what
could
I
do
?
Knowing
you
were
alone
,
*NL*
was
it
possible
that
I
could
stay
away
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
hang
your
head
,
to
make
yourself
the
more
attractive
;
_
I
_
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
they
see
in
you
when
you
hold
it
up
,
'
thought
Mrs.
Sparsit
;
*NL*
`
but
you
little
think
,
my
dearest
love
,
whose
eyes
are
on
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
That
she
hung
her
head
,
was
certain
.
She
urged
him
to
go
away
,
she
*NL*
commanded
him
to
go
away
;
but
she
neither
turned
her
face
to
him
,
nor
*NL*
raised
it
.
Yet
it
was
remarkable
that
she
sat
as
still
as
ever
the
*NL*
amiable
woman
in
ambuscade
had
seen
her
sit
,
at
any
period
in
her
life
.
*NL*
Her
hands
rested
in
one
another
,
like
the
hands
of
a
statue
;
and
even
her
*NL*
manner
of
speaking
was
not
hurried
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
child
,
'
said
Harthouse
;
Mrs.
Sparsit
saw
with
delight
that
his
*NL*
arm
embraced
her
;
`
will
you
not
bear
with
my
society
for
a
little
while
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
,
Louisa
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
we
have
so
little
time
to
make
so
much
of
,
and
I
have
come
so
far
,
*NL*
and
am
altogether
so
devoted
,
and
distracted
.
There
never
was
a
slave
at
*NL*
once
so
devoted
and
ill-used
by
his
mistress
.
To
look
for
your
sunny
*NL*
welcome
that
has
warmed
me
into
life
,
and
to
be
received
in
your
frozen
*NL*
manner
,
is
heart-rending
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Am
I
to
say
again
,
that
I
must
be
left
to
myself
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
we
must
meet
,
my
dear
Louisa
.
Where
shall
we
meet
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
started
.
The
listener
started
,
guiltily
,
too
;
for
she
thought
*NL*
there
was
another
listener
among
the
trees
.
It
was
only
rain
,
beginning
*NL*
to
fall
fast
,
in
heavy
drops
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Shall
I
ride
up
to
the
house
a
few
minutes
hence
,
innocently
supposing
*NL*
that
its
master
is
at
home
and
will
be
charmed
to
receive
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
cruel
commands
are
implicitly
to
be
obeyed
;
though
I
am
the
most
*NL*
unfortunate
fellow
in
the
world
,
I
believe
,
to
have
been
insensible
to
*NL*
all
other
women
,
and
to
have
fallen
prostrate
at
last
under
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
most
beautiful
,
and
the
most
engaging
,
and
the
most
imperious
.
My
*NL*
dearest
Louisa
,
I
can
not
go
myself
,
or
let
you
go
,
in
this
hard
abuse
of
*NL*
your
power
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
saw
him
detain
her
with
his
encircling
arm
,
and
heard
him
*NL*
then
and
there
,
within
her
-LRB-
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
-RRB-
greedy
hearing
,
tell
her
how
*NL*
he
loved
her
,
and
how
she
was
the
stake
for
which
he
ardently
desired
to
*NL*
play
away
all
that
he
had
in
life
.
The
objects
he
had
lately
pursued
,
*NL*
turned
worthless
beside
her
;
such
success
as
was
almost
in
his
grasp
,
he
*NL*
flung
away
from
him
like
the
dirt
it
was
,
compared
with
her
.
Its
*NL*
pursuit
,
nevertheless
,
if
it
kept
him
near
her
,
or
its
renunciation
if
it
*NL*
took
him
from
her
,
or
flight
if
she
shared
it
,
or
secrecy
if
she
*NL*
commanded
it
,
or
any
fate
,
or
every
fate
,
all
was
alike
to
him
,
so
that
*NL*
she
was
true
to
him
,
--
the
man
who
had
seen
how
cast
away
she
was
,
whom
she
*NL*
had
inspired
at
their
first
meeting
with
an
admiration
,
an
interest
,
of
*NL*
which
he
had
thought
himself
incapable
,
whom
she
had
received
into
her
*NL*
confidence
,
who
was
devoted
to
her
and
adored
her
.
All
this
,
and
more
,
*NL*
in
his
hurry
,
and
in
hers
,
in
the
whirl
of
her
own
gratified
malice
,
in
*NL*
the
dread
of
being
discovered
,
in
the
rapidly
increasing
noise
of
heavy
*NL*
rain
among
the
leaves
,
and
a
thunderstorm
rolling
up
--
Mrs.
Sparsit
*NL*
received
into
her
mind
,
set
off
with
such
an
unavoidable
halo
of
*NL*
confusion
and
indistinctness
,
that
when
at
length
he
climbed
the
fence
*NL*
and
led
his
horse
away
,
she
was
not
sure
where
they
were
to
meet
,
or
*NL*
when
,
except
that
they
had
said
it
was
to
be
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
of
them
yet
remained
in
the
darkness
before
her
;
and
while
she
*NL*
tracked
that
one
she
must
be
right
.
`
Oh
,
my
dearest
love
,
'
thought
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
,
`
you
little
think
how
well
attended
you
are
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
saw
her
out
of
the
wood
,
and
saw
her
enter
the
house
.
What
*NL*
to
do
next
?
It
rained
now
,
in
a
sheet
of
water
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
white
*NL*
stockings
were
of
many
colours
,
green
predominating
;
prickly
things
were
*NL*
in
her
shoes
;
caterpillars
slung
themselves
,
in
hammocks
of
their
own
*NL*
making
,
from
various
parts
of
her
dress
;
rills
ran
from
her
bonnet
,
and
*NL*
her
Roman
nose
.
In
such
condition
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
stood
hidden
in
the
*NL*
density
of
the
shrubbery
,
considering
what
next
?
*NL*
*NL*
Lo
,
Louisa
coming
out
of
the
house
!
Hastily
cloaked
and
muffled
,
and
*NL*
stealing
away
.
She
elopes
!
She
falls
from
the
lowermost
stair
,
and
is
*NL*
swallowed
up
in
the
gulf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indifferent
to
the
rain
,
and
moving
with
a
quick
determined
step
,
she
*NL*
struck
into
a
side-path
parallel
with
the
ride
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
followed
in
*NL*
the
shadow
of
the
trees
,
at
but
a
short
distance
;
for
it
was
not
easy
to
*NL*
keep
a
figure
in
view
going
quickly
through
the
umbrageous
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
stopped
to
close
the
side-gate
without
noise
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
*NL*
stopped
.
When
she
went
on
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
went
on
.
She
went
by
the
way
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
had
come
,
emerged
from
the
green
lane
,
crossed
the
stony
*NL*
road
,
and
ascended
the
wooden
steps
to
the
railroad
.
A
train
for
*NL*
Coketown
would
come
through
presently
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
knew
;
so
she
*NL*
understood
Coketown
to
be
her
first
place
of
destination
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
limp
and
streaming
state
,
no
extensive
precautions
were
*NL*
necessary
to
change
her
usual
appearance
;
but
,
she
stopped
under
the
lee
*NL*
of
the
station
wall
,
tumbled
her
shawl
into
a
new
shape
,
and
put
it
on
*NL*
over
her
bonnet
.
So
disguised
she
had
no
fear
of
being
recognized
when
*NL*
she
followed
up
the
railroad
steps
,
and
paid
her
money
in
the
small
*NL*
office
.
Louisa
sat
waiting
in
a
corner
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
sat
waiting
in
*NL*
another
corner
.
Both
listened
to
the
thunder
,
which
was
loud
,
and
to
the
*NL*
rain
,
as
it
washed
off
the
roof
,
and
pattered
on
the
parapets
of
the
*NL*
arches
.
Two
or
three
lamps
were
rained
out
and
blown
out
;
so
,
both
saw
*NL*
the
lightning
to
advantage
as
it
quivered
and
zigzagged
on
the
iron
*NL*
tracks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
seizure
of
the
station
with
a
fit
of
trembling
,
gradually
deepening
*NL*
to
a
complaint
of
the
heart
,
announced
the
train
.
Fire
and
steam
,
and
*NL*
smoke
,
and
red
light
;
a
hiss
,
a
crash
,
a
bell
,
and
a
shriek
;
Louisa
put
*NL*
into
one
carriage
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
put
into
another
:
the
little
station
a
*NL*
desert
speck
in
the
thunderstorm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
her
teeth
chattered
in
her
head
from
wet
and
cold
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
*NL*
exulted
hugely
.
The
figure
had
plunged
down
the
precipice
,
and
she
felt
*NL*
herself
,
as
it
were
,
attending
on
the
body
.
Could
she
,
who
had
been
so
*NL*
active
in
the
getting
up
of
the
funeral
triumph
,
do
less
than
exult
?
*NL*
`
She
will
be
at
Coketown
long
before
him
,
'
thought
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
though
*NL*
his
horse
is
never
so
good
.
Where
will
she
wait
for
him
?
And
where
will
*NL*
they
go
together
?
Patience
.
We
shall
see
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
tremendous
rain
occasioned
infinite
confusion
,
when
the
train
stopped
*NL*
at
its
destination
.
Gutters
and
pipes
had
burst
,
drains
had
overflowed
,
*NL*
and
streets
were
under
water
.
In
the
first
instant
of
alighting
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
turned
her
distracted
eyes
towards
the
waiting
coaches
,
which
*NL*
were
in
great
request
.
`
She
will
get
into
one
,
'
she
considered
,
`
and
*NL*
will
be
away
before
I
can
follow
in
another
.
At
all
risks
of
being
run
*NL*
over
,
I
must
see
the
number
,
and
hear
the
order
given
to
the
coachman
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
wrong
in
her
calculation
.
Louisa
got
into
no
*NL*
coach
,
and
was
already
gone
.
The
black
eyes
kept
upon
the
*NL*
railroad-carriage
in
which
she
had
travelled
,
settled
upon
it
a
moment
*NL*
too
late
.
The
door
not
being
opened
after
several
minutes
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
*NL*
passed
it
and
repassed
it
,
saw
nothing
,
looked
in
,
and
found
it
empty
.
*NL*
Wet
through
and
through
:
with
her
feet
squelching
and
squashing
in
her
*NL*
shoes
whenever
she
moved
;
with
a
rash
of
rain
upon
her
classical
visage
;
*NL*
with
a
bonnet
like
an
over-ripe
fig
;
with
all
her
clothes
spoiled
;
with
*NL*
damp
impressions
of
every
button
,
string
,
and
hook-and-eye
she
wore
,
*NL*
printed
off
upon
her
highly
connected
back
;
with
a
stagnant
verdure
on
*NL*
her
general
exterior
,
such
as
accumulates
on
an
old
park
fence
in
a
*NL*
mouldy
lane
;
Mrs.
Sparsit
had
no
resource
but
to
burst
into
tears
of
*NL*
bitterness
and
say
,
'
I
have
lost
her
!

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
DOWN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
national
dustmen
,
after
entertaining
one
another
with
a
great
many
*NL*
noisy
little
fights
among
themselves
,
had
dispersed
for
the
present
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
was
at
home
for
the
vacation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
writing
in
the
room
with
the
deadly
statistical
clock
,
proving
*NL*
something
no
doubt
--
probably
,
in
the
main
,
that
the
Good
Samaritan
was
a
*NL*
Bad
Economist
.
The
noise
of
the
rain
did
not
disturb
him
much
;
but
it
*NL*
attracted
his
attention
sufficiently
to
make
him
raise
his
head
*NL*
sometimes
,
as
if
he
were
rather
remonstrating
with
the
elements
.
When
it
*NL*
thundered
very
loudly
,
he
glanced
towards
Coketown
,
having
it
in
his
mind
*NL*
that
some
of
the
tall
chimneys
might
be
struck
by
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thunder
was
rolling
into
distance
,
and
the
rain
was
pouring
down
like
*NL*
a
deluge
,
when
the
door
of
his
room
opened
.
He
looked
round
the
lamp
*NL*
upon
his
table
,
and
saw
,
with
amazement
,
his
eldest
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
the
matter
?
How
strange
you
look
!
And
good
Heaven
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
,
wondering
more
and
more
,
`
have
you
come
here
exposed
to
this
*NL*
storm
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hands
to
her
dress
,
as
if
she
hardly
knew
.
`
Yes
.
'
Then
she
*NL*
uncovered
her
head
,
and
letting
her
cloak
and
hood
fall
where
they
might
,
*NL*
stood
looking
at
him
:
so
colourless
,
so
dishevelled
,
so
defiant
and
*NL*
despairing
,
that
he
was
afraid
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
it
?
I
conjure
you
,
Louisa
,
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
into
a
chair
before
him
,
and
put
her
cold
hand
on
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
you
have
trained
me
from
my
cradle
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
curse
the
hour
in
which
I
was
born
to
such
a
destiny
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
in
doubt
and
dread
,
vacantly
repeating
:
`
Curse
the
hour
?
*NL*
Curse
the
hour
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
could
you
give
me
life
,
and
take
from
me
all
the
inappreciable
*NL*
things
that
raise
it
from
the
state
of
conscious
death
?
Where
are
the
*NL*
graces
of
my
soul
?
Where
are
the
sentiments
of
my
heart
?
What
have
you
*NL*
done
,
O
father
,
what
have
you
done
,
with
the
garden
that
should
have
*NL*
bloomed
once
,
in
this
great
wilderness
here
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
struck
herself
with
both
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
it
had
ever
been
here
,
its
ashes
alone
would
save
me
from
the
void
in
*NL*
which
my
whole
life
sinks
.
I
did
not
mean
to
say
this
;
but
,
father
,
you
*NL*
remember
the
last
time
we
conversed
in
this
room
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
so
wholly
unprepared
for
what
he
heard
now
,
that
it
was
with
*NL*
difficulty
he
answered
,
`
Yes
,
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
has
risen
to
my
lips
now
,
would
have
risen
to
my
lips
then
,
if
you
*NL*
had
given
me
a
moment
's
help
.
I
do
n't
reproach
you
,
father
.
What
you
*NL*
have
never
nurtured
in
me
,
you
have
never
nurtured
in
yourself
;
but
O
!
if
*NL*
you
had
only
done
so
long
ago
,
or
if
you
had
only
neglected
me
,
what
a
*NL*
much
better
and
much
happier
creature
I
should
have
been
this
day
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
,
after
all
his
care
,
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
*NL*
groaned
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
if
you
had
known
,
when
we
were
last
together
here
,
what
even
I
*NL*
feared
while
I
strove
against
it
--
as
it
has
been
my
task
from
infancy
to
*NL*
strive
against
every
natural
prompting
that
has
arisen
in
my
heart
;
if
*NL*
you
had
known
that
there
lingered
in
my
breast
,
sensibilities
,
*NL*
affections
,
weaknesses
capable
of
being
cherished
into
strength
,
defying
*NL*
all
the
calculations
ever
made
by
man
,
and
no
more
known
to
his
*NL*
arithmetic
than
his
Creator
is
,
--
would
you
have
given
me
to
the
husband
*NL*
whom
I
am
now
sure
that
I
hate
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
`
No
.
No
,
my
poor
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Would
you
have
doomed
me
,
at
any
time
,
to
the
frost
and
blight
that
have
*NL*
hardened
and
spoiled
me
?
Would
you
have
robbed
me
--
for
no
one
's
*NL*
enrichment
--
only
for
the
greater
desolation
of
this
world
--
of
the
*NL*
immaterial
part
of
my
life
,
the
spring
and
summer
of
my
belief
,
my
refuge
*NL*
from
what
is
sordid
and
bad
in
the
real
things
around
me
,
my
school
in
*NL*
which
I
should
have
learned
to
be
more
humble
and
more
trusting
with
*NL*
them
,
and
to
hope
in
my
little
sphere
to
make
them
better
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
no
,
no
.
No
,
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yet
,
father
,
if
I
had
been
stone
blind
;
if
I
had
groped
my
way
by
my
*NL*
sense
of
touch
,
and
had
been
free
,
while
I
knew
the
shapes
and
surfaces
*NL*
of
things
,
to
exercise
my
fancy
somewhat
,
in
regard
to
them
;
I
should
*NL*
have
been
a
million
times
wiser
,
happier
,
more
loving
,
more
contented
,
*NL*
more
innocent
and
human
in
all
good
respects
,
than
I
am
with
the
eyes
I
*NL*
have
.
Now
,
hear
what
I
have
come
to
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
,
to
support
her
with
his
arm
.
She
rising
as
he
did
so
,
they
*NL*
stood
close
together
:
she
,
with
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
looking
fixedly
*NL*
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
With
a
hunger
and
thirst
upon
me
,
father
,
which
have
never
been
for
a
*NL*
moment
appeased
;
with
an
ardent
impulse
towards
some
region
where
rules
,
*NL*
and
figures
,
and
definitions
were
not
quite
absolute
;
I
have
grown
up
,
*NL*
battling
every
inch
of
my
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
knew
you
were
unhappy
,
my
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
I
always
knew
it
.
In
this
strife
I
have
almost
repulsed
and
*NL*
crushed
my
better
angel
into
a
demon
.
What
I
have
learned
has
left
me
*NL*
doubting
,
misbelieving
,
despising
,
regretting
,
what
I
have
not
learned
;
*NL*
and
my
dismal
resource
has
been
to
think
that
life
would
soon
go
by
,
and
*NL*
that
nothing
in
it
could
be
worth
the
pain
and
trouble
of
a
contest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
so
young
,
Louisa
!
'
he
said
with
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
so
young
.
In
this
condition
,
father
--
for
I
show
you
now
,
without
*NL*
fear
or
favour
,
the
ordinary
deadened
state
of
my
mind
as
I
know
it
--
you
*NL*
proposed
my
husband
to
me
.
I
took
him
.
I
never
made
a
pretence
to
him
*NL*
or
you
that
I
loved
him
.
I
knew
,
and
,
father
,
you
knew
,
and
he
knew
,
*NL*
that
I
never
did
.
I
was
not
wholly
indifferent
,
for
I
had
a
hope
of
*NL*
being
pleasant
and
useful
to
Tom
.
I
made
that
wild
escape
into
something
*NL*
visionary
,
and
have
slowly
found
out
how
wild
it
was
.
But
Tom
had
been
*NL*
the
subject
of
all
the
little
tenderness
of
my
life
;
perhaps
he
became
so
*NL*
because
I
knew
so
well
how
to
pity
him
.
It
matters
little
now
,
except
as
*NL*
it
may
dispose
you
to
think
more
leniently
of
his
errors
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
her
father
held
her
in
his
arms
,
she
put
her
other
hand
upon
his
other
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
still
looking
fixedly
in
his
face
,
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
was
irrevocably
married
,
there
rose
up
into
rebellion
against
the
*NL*
tie
,
the
old
strife
,
made
fiercer
by
all
those
causes
of
disparity
which
*NL*
arise
out
of
our
two
individual
natures
,
and
which
no
general
laws
shall
*NL*
ever
rule
or
state
for
me
,
father
,
until
they
shall
be
able
to
direct
the
*NL*
anatomist
where
to
strike
his
knife
into
the
secrets
of
my
soul
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
!
'
he
said
,
and
said
imploringly
;
for
he
well
remembered
what
had
*NL*
passed
between
them
in
their
former
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
not
reproach
you
,
father
,
I
make
no
complaint
.
I
am
here
with
*NL*
another
object
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
can
I
do
,
child
?
Ask
me
what
you
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
coming
to
it
.
Father
,
chance
then
threw
into
my
way
a
new
*NL*
acquaintance
;
a
man
such
as
I
had
had
no
experience
of
;
used
to
the
*NL*
world
;
light
,
polished
,
easy
;
making
no
pretences
;
avowing
the
low
*NL*
estimate
of
everything
,
that
I
was
half
afraid
to
form
in
secret
;
*NL*
conveying
to
me
almost
immediately
,
though
I
do
n't
know
how
or
by
what
*NL*
degrees
,
that
he
understood
me
,
and
read
my
thoughts
.
I
could
not
find
*NL*
that
he
was
worse
than
I
.
There
seemed
to
be
a
near
affinity
between
us
.
*NL*
I
only
wondered
it
should
be
worth
his
while
,
who
cared
for
nothing
else
,
*NL*
to
care
so
much
for
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
you
,
Louisa
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
might
instinctively
have
loosened
his
hold
,
but
that
he
felt
*NL*
her
strength
departing
from
her
,
and
saw
a
wild
dilating
fire
in
the
eyes
*NL*
steadfastly
regarding
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
nothing
of
his
plea
for
claiming
my
confidence
.
It
matters
very
*NL*
little
how
he
gained
it
.
Father
,
he
did
gain
it
.
What
you
know
of
the
*NL*
story
of
my
marriage
,
he
soon
knew
,
just
as
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
's
face
was
ashy
white
,
and
he
held
her
in
both
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
done
no
worse
,
I
have
not
disgraced
you
.
But
if
you
ask
me
*NL*
whether
I
have
loved
him
,
or
do
love
him
,
I
tell
you
plainly
,
father
,
*NL*
that
it
may
be
so
.
I
do
n't
know

*NL*
She
took
her
hands
suddenly
from
his
shoulders
,
and
pressed
them
both
*NL*
upon
her
side
;
while
in
her
face
,
not
like
itself
--
and
in
her
figure
,
*NL*
drawn
up
,
resolute
to
finish
by
a
last
effort
what
she
had
to
say
--
the
*NL*
feelings
long
suppressed
broke
loose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
night
,
my
husband
being
away
,
he
has
been
with
me
,
declaring
*NL*
himself
my
lover
.
This
minute
he
expects
me
,
for
I
could
release
myself
*NL*
of
his
presence
by
no
other
means
.
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
sorry
,
I
do
*NL*
not
know
that
I
am
ashamed
,
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
degraded
in
my
own
*NL*
esteem
.
All
that
I
know
is
,
your
philosophy
and
your
teaching
will
not
*NL*
save
me

Now
,
father
,
you
have
brought
me
to
this
.
Save
me
by
some
*NL*
other
means
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
tightened
his
hold
in
time
to
prevent
her
sinking
on
the
floor
,
but
*NL*
she
cried
out
in
a
terrible
voice
,
'
I
shall
die
if
you
hold
me
!
Let
me
*NL*
fall
upon
the
ground
!
'
And
he
laid
her
down
there
,
and
saw
the
pride
of
*NL*
his
heart
and
the
triumph
of
his
system
,
lying
,
an
insensible
heap
,
at
*NL*
his
feet
.

ANOTHER
THING
NEEDFUL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
LOUISA
awoke
from
a
torpor
,
and
her
eyes
languidly
opened
on
her
old
bed
*NL*
at
home
,
and
her
old
room
.
It
seemed
,
at
first
,
as
if
all
that
had
*NL*
happened
since
the
days
when
these
objects
were
familiar
to
her
were
the
*NL*
shadows
of
a
dream
,
but
gradually
,
as
the
objects
became
more
real
to
her
*NL*
sight
,
the
events
became
more
real
to
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
scarcely
move
her
head
for
pain
and
heaviness
,
her
eyes
were
*NL*
strained
and
sore
,
and
she
was
very
weak
.
A
curious
passive
inattention
*NL*
had
such
possession
of
her
,
that
the
presence
of
her
little
sister
in
the
*NL*
room
did
not
attract
her
notice
for
some
time
.
Even
when
their
eyes
had
*NL*
met
,
and
her
sister
had
approached
the
bed
,
Louisa
lay
for
minutes
*NL*
looking
at
her
in
silence
,
and
suffering
her
timidly
to
hold
her
passive
*NL*
hand
,
before
she
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
was
I
brought
to
this
room
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Last
night
,
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
brought
me
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sissy
,
I
believe
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
do
you
believe
so
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
I
found
her
here
this
morning
.
She
did
n't
come
to
my
bedside
to
*NL*
wake
me
,
as
she
always
does
;
and
I
went
to
look
for
her
.
She
was
not
in
*NL*
her
own
room
either
;
and
I
went
looking
for
her
all
over
the
house
,
until
*NL*
I
found
her
here
taking
care
of
you
and
cooling
your
head
.
Will
you
see
*NL*
father
?
Sissy
said
I
was
to
tell
him
when
you
woke
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
beaming
face
you
have
,
Jane
!
'
said
Louisa
,
as
her
young
*NL*
sister
--
timidly
still
--
bent
down
to
kiss
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
I
?
I
am
very
glad
you
think
so
.
I
am
sure
it
must
be
Sissy
's
*NL*
doing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
arm
Louisa
had
begun
to
twine
around
her
neck
,
unbent
itself
.
`
You
*NL*
can
tell
father
if
you
will
.
'
Then
,
staying
her
for
a
moment
,
she
said
,
*NL*
`
It
was
you
who
made
my
room
so
cheerful
,
and
gave
it
this
look
of
*NL*
welcome
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
no
,
Louisa
,
it
was
done
before
I
came
.
It
was
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
turned
upon
her
pillow
,
and
heard
no
more
.
When
her
sister
had
*NL*
withdrawn
,
she
turned
her
head
back
again
,
and
lay
with
her
face
towards
*NL*
the
door
,
until
it
opened
and
her
father
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
jaded
anxious
look
upon
him
,
and
his
hand
,
usually
steady
,
*NL*
trembled
in
hers
.
He
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
bed
,
tenderly
asking
*NL*
how
she
was
,
and
dwelling
on
the
necessity
of
her
keeping
very
quiet
*NL*
after
her
agitation
and
exposure
to
the
weather
last
night
.
He
spoke
in
*NL*
a
subdued
and
troubled
voice
,
very
different
from
his
usual
dictatorial
*NL*
manner
;
and
was
often
at
a
loss
for
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Louisa
.
My
poor
daughter
.
'
He
was
so
much
at
a
loss
at
that
*NL*
place
,
that
he
stopped
altogether
.
He
tried
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
unfortunate
child
.
'
The
place
was
so
difficult
to
get
over
,
that
he
*NL*
tried
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
would
be
hopeless
for
me
,
Louisa
,
to
endeavour
to
tell
you
how
*NL*
overwhelmed
I
have
been
,
and
still
am
,
by
what
broke
upon
me
last
night
.
*NL*
The
ground
on
which
I
stand
has
ceased
to
be
solid
under
my
feet
.
The
*NL*
only
support
on
which
I
leaned
,
and
the
strength
of
which
it
seemed
,
and
*NL*
still
does
seem
,
impossible
to
question
,
has
given
way
in
an
instant
.
I
*NL*
am
stunned
by
these
discoveries
.
I
have
no
selfish
meaning
in
what
I
*NL*
say
;
but
I
find
the
shock
of
what
broke
upon
me
last
night
,
to
be
very
*NL*
heavy
indeed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
give
him
no
comfort
herein
.
She
had
suffered
the
wreck
of
her
*NL*
whole
life
upon
the
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
not
say
,
Louisa
,
that
if
you
had
by
any
happy
chance
undeceived
*NL*
me
some
time
ago
,
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
both
;
better
for
your
*NL*
peace
,
and
better
for
mine
.
For
I
am
sensible
that
it
may
not
have
been
*NL*
a
part
of
my
system
to
invite
any
confidence
of
that
kind
.
I
had
proved
*NL*
my
--
my
system
to
myself
,
and
I
have
rigidly
administered
it
;
and
I
must
*NL*
bear
the
responsibility
of
its
failures
.
I
only
entreat
you
to
believe
,
*NL*
my
favourite
child
,
that
I
have
meant
to
do
right
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
earnestly
,
and
to
do
him
justice
he
had
.
In
gauging
*NL*
fathomless
deeps
with
his
little
mean
excise-rod
,
and
in
staggering
over
*NL*
the
universe
with
his
rusty
stiff-legged
compasses
,
he
had
meant
to
do
*NL*
great
things
.
Within
the
limits
of
his
short
tether
he
had
tumbled
*NL*
about
,
annihilating
the
flowers
of
existence
with
greater
singleness
of
*NL*
purpose
than
many
of
the
blatant
personages
whose
company
he
kept
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
well
assured
of
what
you
say
,
father
.
I
know
I
have
been
your
*NL*
favourite
child
.
I
know
you
have
intended
to
make
me
happy
.
I
have
*NL*
never
blamed
you
,
and
I
never
shall
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
outstretched
hand
,
and
retained
it
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
,
I
have
remained
all
night
at
my
table
,
pondering
again
and
*NL*
again
on
what
has
so
painfully
passed
between
us
.
When
I
consider
your
*NL*
character
;
when
I
consider
that
what
has
been
known
to
me
for
hours
,
has
*NL*
been
concealed
by
you
for
years
;
when
I
consider
under
what
immediate
*NL*
pressure
it
has
been
forced
from
you
at
last
;
I
come
to
the
conclusion
*NL*
that
I
can
not
but
mistrust
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
have
added
more
than
all
,
when
he
saw
the
face
now
looking
at
*NL*
him
.
He
did
add
it
in
effect
,
perhaps
,
as
he
softly
moved
her
scattered
*NL*
hair
from
her
forehead
with
his
hand
.
Such
little
actions
,
slight
in
*NL*
another
man
,
were
very
noticeable
in
him
;
and
his
daughter
received
them
*NL*
as
if
they
had
been
words
of
contrition
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
slowly
,
and
with
hesitation
,
as
well
as
with
a
*NL*
wretched
sense
of
happiness
,
`
if
I
see
reason
to
mistrust
myself
for
the
*NL*
past
,
Louisa
,
I
should
also
mistrust
myself
for
the
present
and
the
*NL*
future
.
To
speak
unreservedly
to
you
,
I
do
.
I
am
far
from
feeling
*NL*
convinced
now
,
however
differently
I
might
have
felt
only
this
time
*NL*
yesterday
,
that
I
am
fit
for
the
trust
you
repose
in
me
;
that
I
know
how
*NL*
to
respond
to
the
appeal
you
have
come
home
to
make
to
me
;
that
I
have
*NL*
the
right
instinct
--
supposing
it
for
the
moment
to
be
some
quality
of
that
*NL*
nature
--
how
to
help
you
,
and
to
set
you
right
,
my
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
turned
upon
her
pillow
,
and
lay
with
her
face
upon
her
arm
,
so
*NL*
that
he
could
not
see
it
.
All
her
wildness
and
passion
had
subsided
;
*NL*
but
,
though
softened
,
she
was
not
in
tears
.
Her
father
was
changed
in
*NL*
nothing
so
much
as
in
the
respect
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
see
her
*NL*
in
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Some
persons
hold
,
'
he
pursued
,
still
hesitating
,
`
that
there
is
a
*NL*
wisdom
of
the
Head
,
and
that
there
is
a
wisdom
of
the
Heart
.
I
have
not
*NL*
supposed
so
;
but
,
as
I
have
said
,
I
mistrust
myself
now
.
I
have
supposed
*NL*
the
head
to
be
all-sufficient
.
It
may
not
be
all-sufficient
;
how
can
I
*NL*
venture
this
morning
to
say
it
is
!
If
that
other
kind
of
wisdom
should
*NL*
be
what
I
have
neglected
,
and
should
be
the
instinct
that
is
wanted
,
*NL*
Louisa
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
suggested
it
very
doubtfully
,
as
if
he
were
half
unwilling
to
admit
it
*NL*
even
now
.
She
made
him
no
answer
,
lying
before
him
on
her
bed
,
still
*NL*
half-dressed
,
much
as
he
had
seen
her
lying
on
the
floor
of
his
room
last
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
,
'
and
his
hand
rested
on
her
hair
again
,
'
I
have
been
absent
from
*NL*
here
,
my
dear
,
a
good
deal
of
late
;
and
though
your
sister
's
training
has
*NL*
been
pursued
according
to
--
the
system
,
'
he
appeared
to
come
to
that
word
*NL*
with
great
reluctance
always
,
`
it
has
necessarily
been
modified
by
daily
*NL*
associations
begun
,
in
her
case
,
at
an
early
age
.
I
ask
you
--
ignorantly
*NL*
and
humbly
,
my
daughter
--
for
the
better
,
do
you
think
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
'
she
replied
,
without
stirring
,
`
if
any
harmony
has
been
*NL*
awakened
in
her
young
breast
that
was
mute
in
mine
until
it
turned
to
*NL*
discord
,
let
her
thank
Heaven
for
it
,
and
go
upon
her
happier
way
,
taking
*NL*
it
as
her
greatest
blessing
that
she
has
avoided
my
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
my
child
,
my
child
!
'
he
said
,
in
a
forlorn
manner
,
'
I
am
an
unhappy
*NL*
man
to
see
you
thus
!
What
avails
it
to
me
that
you
do
not
reproach
me
,
*NL*
if
I
so
bitterly
reproach
myself
!
'
He
bent
his
head
,
and
spoke
low
to
*NL*
her
.
`
Louisa
,
I
have
a
misgiving
that
some
change
may
have
been
slowly
*NL*
working
about
me
in
this
house
,
by
mere
love
and
gratitude
:
that
what
the
*NL*
Head
had
left
undone
and
could
not
do
,
the
Heart
may
have
been
doing
*NL*
silently
.
Can
it
be
so
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
him
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
not
too
proud
to
believe
it
,
Louisa
.
How
could
I
be
arrogant
,
and
*NL*
you
before
me
!
Can
it
be
so
?
Is
it
so
,
my
dear
?
'
He
looked
upon
her
*NL*
once
more
,
lying
cast
away
there
;
and
without
another
word
went
out
of
*NL*
the
room
.
He
had
not
been
long
gone
,
when
she
heard
a
light
tread
near
*NL*
the
door
,
and
knew
that
some
one
stood
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
raise
her
head
.
A
dull
anger
that
she
should
be
seen
in
her
*NL*
distress
,
and
that
the
involuntary
look
she
had
so
resented
should
come
*NL*
to
this
fulfilment
,
smouldered
within
her
like
an
unwholesome
fire
.
All
*NL*
closely
imprisoned
forces
rend
and
destroy
.
The
air
that
would
be
*NL*
healthful
to
the
earth
,
the
water
that
would
enrich
it
,
the
heat
that
*NL*
would
ripen
it
,
tear
it
when
caged
up
.
So
in
her
bosom
even
now
;
the
*NL*
strongest
qualities
she
possessed
,
long
turned
upon
themselves
,
became
a
*NL*
heap
of
obduracy
,
that
rose
against
a
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
well
that
soft
touch
came
upon
her
neck
,
and
that
she
understood
*NL*
herself
to
be
supposed
to
have
fallen
asleep
.
The
sympathetic
hand
did
*NL*
not
claim
her
resentment
.
Let
it
lie
there
,
let
it
lie
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
lay
there
,
warming
into
life
a
crowd
of
gentler
thoughts
;
and
she
*NL*
rested
.
As
she
softened
with
the
quiet
,
and
the
consciousness
of
being
*NL*
so
watched
,
some
tears
made
their
way
into
her
eyes
.
The
face
touched
*NL*
hers
,
and
she
knew
that
there
were
tears
upon
it
too
,
and
she
the
cause
*NL*
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Louisa
feigned
to
rouse
herself
,
and
sat
up
,
Sissy
retired
,
so
that
*NL*
she
stood
placidly
near
the
bedside
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
I
have
not
disturbed
you
.
I
have
come
to
ask
if
you
would
let
me
*NL*
stay
with
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
should
you
stay
with
me
?
My
sister
will
miss
you
.
You
are
*NL*
everything
to
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Am
I
?
'
returned
Sissy
,
shaking
her
head
.
'
I
would
be
something
to
you
,
*NL*
if
I
might
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
?
'
said
Louisa
,
almost
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whatever
you
want
most
,
if
I
could
be
that
.
At
all
events
,
I
would
like
*NL*
to
try
to
be
as
near
it
as
I
can
.
And
however
far
off
that
may
be
,
I
*NL*
will
never
tire
of
trying
.
Will
you
let
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
father
sent
you
to
ask
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
indeed
,
'
replied
Sissy
.
`
He
told
me
that
I
might
come
in
now
,
but
he
*NL*
sent
me
away
from
the
room
this
morning
--
or
at
least
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
least
,
what
?
'
said
Louisa
,
with
her
searching
eyes
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
it
best
myself
that
I
should
be
sent
away
,
for
I
felt
very
*NL*
uncertain
whether
you
would
like
to
find
me
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
I
always
hated
you
so
much
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
not
,
for
I
have
always
loved
you
,
and
have
always
wished
that
you
*NL*
should
know
it
.
But
you
changed
to
me
a
little
,
shortly
before
you
left
*NL*
home
.
Not
that
I
wondered
at
it
.
You
knew
so
much
,
and
I
knew
so
*NL*
little
,
and
it
was
so
natural
in
many
ways
,
going
as
you
were
among
other
*NL*
friends
,
that
I
had
nothing
to
complain
of
,
and
was
not
at
all
hurt
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
colour
rose
as
she
said
it
modestly
and
hurriedly
.
Louisa
understood
*NL*
the
loving
pretence
,
and
her
heart
smote
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
May
I
try
?
'
said
Sissy
,
emboldened
to
raise
her
hand
to
the
neck
that
*NL*
was
insensibly
drooping
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
,
taking
down
the
hand
that
would
have
embraced
her
in
another
*NL*
moment
,
held
it
in
one
of
hers
,
and
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
First
,
Sissy
,
do
you
know
what
I
am
?
I
am
so
proud
and
so
hardened
,
so
*NL*
confused
and
troubled
,
so
resentful
and
unjust
to
every
one
and
to
*NL*
myself
,
that
everything
is
stormy
,
dark
,
and
wicked
to
me
.
Does
not
that
*NL*
repel
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
so
unhappy
,
and
all
that
should
have
made
me
otherwise
is
so
laid
*NL*
waste
,
that
if
I
had
been
bereft
of
sense
to
this
hour
,
and
instead
of
*NL*
being
as
learned
as
you
think
me
,
had
to
begin
to
acquire
the
simplest
*NL*
truths
,
I
could
not
want
a
guide
to
peace
,
contentment
,
honour
,
all
the
*NL*
good
of
which
I
am
quite
devoid
,
more
abjectly
than
I
do
.
Does
not
that
*NL*
repel
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
innocence
of
her
brave
affection
,
and
the
brimming
up
of
her
old
*NL*
devoted
spirit
,
the
once
deserted
girl
shone
like
a
beautiful
light
upon
*NL*
the
darkness
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
raised
the
hand
that
it
might
clasp
her
neck
and
join
its
fellow
*NL*
there
.
She
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
clinging
to
this
stroller
's
child
*NL*
looked
up
at
her
almost
with
veneration
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Forgive
me
,
pity
me
,
help
me
!
Have
compassion
on
my
great
need
,
and
let
*NL*
me
lay
this
head
of
mine
upon
a
loving
heart
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
lay
it
here

cried
Sissy

`
Lay
it
here
,
my

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
VERY
RIDICULOUS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MR.
JAMES
HARTHOUSE
passed
a
whole
night
and
a
day
in
a
state
of
so
much
*NL*
hurry
,
that
the
World
,
with
its
best
glass
in
his
eye
,
would
scarcely
*NL*
have
recognized
him
during
that
insane
interval
,
as
the
brother
Jem
of
*NL*
the
honourable
and
jocular
member
.
He
was
positively
agitated
.
He
*NL*
several
times
spoke
with
an
emphasis
,
similar
to
the
vulgar
manner
.
He
*NL*
went
in
and
went
out
in
an
unaccountable
way
,
like
a
man
without
an
*NL*
object
.
He
rode
like
a
highwayman
.
In
a
word
,
he
was
so
horribly
bored
*NL*
by
existing
circumstances
,
that
he
forgot
to
go
in
for
boredom
in
the
*NL*
manner
prescribed
by
the
authorities
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
putting
his
horse
at
Coketown
through
the
storm
,
as
if
it
were
a
*NL*
leap
,
he
waited
up
all
night
:
from
time
to
time
ringing
his
bell
with
the
*NL*
greatest
fury
,
charging
the
porter
who
kept
watch
with
delinquency
in
*NL*
withholding
letters
or
messages
that
could
not
fail
to
have
been
*NL*
entrusted
to
him
,
and
demanding
restitution
on
the
spot
.
The
dawn
*NL*
coming
,
the
morning
coming
,
and
the
day
coming
,
and
neither
message
nor
*NL*
letter
coming
with
either
,
he
went
down
to
the
country
house
.
There
,
the
*NL*
report
was
,
Mr.
Bounderby
away
,
and
Mrs.
Bounderby
in
town
.
Left
for
*NL*
town
suddenly
last
evening
.
Not
even
known
to
be
gone
until
receipt
of
*NL*
message
,
importing
that
her
return
was
not
to
be
expected
for
the
*NL*
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
circumstances
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
follow
her
to
town
.
*NL*
He
went
to
the
house
in
town
.
Mrs.
Bounderby
not
there
.
He
looked
in
at
*NL*
the
Bank
.
Mr.
Bounderby
away
and
Mrs.
Sparsit
away
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
away
?
*NL*
Who
could
have
been
reduced
to
sudden
extremity
for
the
company
of
that
*NL*
griffin
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
I
do
n't
know
,
'
said
Tom
,
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
being
uneasy
*NL*
about
it
.
`
She
was
off
somewhere
at
daybreak
this
morning
.
She
's
always
*NL*
full
of
mystery
;
I
hate
her
.
So
I
do
that
white
chap
;
he
's
always
got
*NL*
his
blinking
eyes
upon
a
fellow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
were
you
last
night
,
Tom
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
was
I
last
night
!
'
said
Tom
.
`
Come
!
I
like
that
.
I
was
waiting
*NL*
for
you
,
Mr.
Harthouse
,
till
it
came
down
as
_
I
_
never
saw
it
come
down
*NL*
before
.
Where
was
I
too
!
Where
were
you
,
you
mean
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
prevented
from
coming
--
detained
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Detained
!
'
murmured
Tom
.
`
Two
of
us
were
detained
.
I
was
detained
*NL*
looking
for
you
,
till
I
lost
every
train
but
the
mail
.
It
would
have
*NL*
been
a
pleasant
job
to
go
down
by
that
on
such
a
night
,
and
have
to
walk
*NL*
home
through
a
pond
.
I
was
obliged
to
sleep
in
town
after
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
?
Why
,
in
my
own
bed
at
Bounderby
's
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
you
see
your
sister
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
the
deuce
,
'
returned
Tom
,
staring
,
`
could
I
see
my
sister
when
she
*NL*
was
fifteen
miles
off
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Cursing
these
quick
retorts
of
the
young
gentleman
to
whom
he
was
so
true
*NL*
a
friend
,
Mr.
Harthouse
disembarrassed
himself
of
that
interview
with
the
*NL*
smallest
conceivable
amount
of
ceremony
,
and
debated
for
the
hundredth
*NL*
time
what
all
this
could
mean
?
He
made
only
one
thing
clear
.
It
was
,
*NL*
that
whether
she
was
in
town
or
out
of
town
,
whether
he
had
been
*NL*
premature
with
her
who
was
so
hard
to
comprehend
,
or
she
had
lost
*NL*
courage
,
or
they
were
discovered
,
or
some
mischance
or
mistake
,
at
*NL*
present
incomprehensible
,
had
occurred
,
he
must
remain
to
confront
his
*NL*
fortune
,
whatever
it
was
.
The
hotel
where
he
was
known
to
live
when
*NL*
condemned
to
that
region
of
blackness
,
was
the
stake
to
which
he
was
*NL*
tied
.
As
to
all
the
rest
--
What
will
be
,
will
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
,
whether
I
am
waiting
for
a
hostile
message
,
or
an
assignation
,
or
a
*NL*
penitent
remonstrance
,
or
an
impromptu
wrestle
with
my
friend
Bounderby
*NL*
in
the
Lancashire
manner
--
which
would
seem
as
likely
as
anything
else
in
*NL*
the
present
state
of
affairs
--
I
'll
dine
,
'
said
Mr.
James
Harthouse
.
*NL*
`
Bounderby
has
the
advantage
in
point
of
weight
;
and
if
anything
of
a
*NL*
British
nature
is
to
come
off
between
us
,
it
may
be
as
well
to
be
in
*NL*
training
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
he
rang
the
bell
,
and
tossing
himself
negligently
on
a
sofa
,
*NL*
ordered
`
Some
dinner
at
six
--
with
a
beefsteak
in
it
,
'
and
got
through
the
*NL*
intervening
time
as
well
as
he
could
.
That
was
not
particularly
well
;
*NL*
for
he
remained
in
the
greatest
perplexity
,
and
,
as
the
hours
went
on
,
*NL*
and
no
kind
of
explanation
offered
itself
,
his
perplexity
augmented
at
*NL*
compound
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
took
affairs
as
coolly
as
it
was
in
human
nature
to
do
,
and
*NL*
entertained
himself
with
the
facetious
idea
of
the
training
more
than
*NL*
once
.
`
It
would
n't
be
bad
,
'
he
yawned
at
one
time
,
`
to
give
the
waiter
*NL*
five
shillings
,
and
throw
him
.
'
At
another
time
it
occurred
to
him
,
`
Or
*NL*
a
fellow
of
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
stone
might
be
hired
by
the
hour
.
'
*NL*
But
these
jests
did
not
tell
materially
on
the
afternoon
,
or
his
*NL*
suspense
;
and
,
sooth
to
say
,
they
both
lagged
fearfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
,
even
before
dinner
,
to
avoid
often
walking
about
in
*NL*
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
,
looking
out
of
the
window
,
listening
at
the
*NL*
door
for
footsteps
,
and
occasionally
becoming
rather
hot
when
any
steps
*NL*
approached
that
room
.
But
,
after
dinner
,
when
the
day
turned
to
*NL*
twilight
,
and
the
twilight
turned
to
night
,
and
still
no
communication
*NL*
was
made
to
him
,
it
began
to
be
as
he
expressed
it
,
`
like
the
Holy
Office
*NL*
and
slow
torture
.
'
However
,
still
true
to
his
conviction
that
*NL*
indifference
was
the
genuine
high-breeding
-LRB-
the
only
conviction
he
had
-RRB-
,
*NL*
he
seized
this
crisis
as
the
opportunity
for
ordering
candles
and
a
*NL*
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
trying
in
vain
,
for
half
an
hour
,
to
read
this
newspaper
,
*NL*
when
the
waiter
appeared
and
said
,
at
once
mysteriously
and
*NL*
apologetically
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
You
're
wanted
,
sir
,
if
you
please
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
general
recollection
that
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
the
Police
said
to
*NL*
the
swell
mob
,
caused
Mr.
Harthouse
to
ask
the
waiter
in
return
,
with
*NL*
bristling
indignation
,
what
the
Devil
he
meant
by
`
wanted
'
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
Young
lady
outside
,
sir
,
wishes
to
see
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Outside
?
Where
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Outside
this
door
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Giving
the
waiter
to
the
personage
before
mentioned
,
as
a
block-head
duly
*NL*
qualified
for
that
consignment
,
Mr.
Harthouse
hurried
into
the
gallery
.
*NL*
A
young
woman
whom
he
had
never
seen
stood
there
.
Plainly
dressed
,
very
*NL*
quiet
,
very
pretty
.
As
he
conducted
her
into
the
room
and
placed
a
chair
*NL*
for
her
,
he
observed
,
by
the
light
of
the
candles
,
that
she
was
even
*NL*
prettier
than
he
had
at
first
believed
.
Her
face
was
innocent
and
*NL*
youthful
,
and
its
expression
remarkably
pleasant
.
She
was
not
afraid
of
*NL*
him
,
or
in
any
way
disconcerted
;
she
seemed
to
have
her
mind
entirely
*NL*
preoccupied
with
the
occasion
of
her
visit
,
and
to
have
substituted
that
*NL*
consideration
for
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
speak
to
Mr.
Harthouse
?
'
she
said
,
when
they
were
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
Mr.
Harthouse
.
'
He
added
in
his
mind
,
`
And
you
speak
to
him
with
the
*NL*
most
confiding
eyes
I
ever
saw
,
and
the
most
earnest
voice
-LRB-
though
so
*NL*
quiet
-RRB-
I
ever
heard
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
do
not
understand
--
and
I
do
not
,
sir
'
--
said
Sissy
,
`
what
your
honour
*NL*
as
a
gentleman
binds
you
to
,
in
other
matters
:
'
the
blood
really
rose
in
*NL*
his
face
as
she
began
in
these
words
:
'
I
am
sure
I
may
rely
upon
it
to
*NL*
keep
my
visit
secret
,
and
to
keep
secret
what
I
am
going
to
say
.
I
will
*NL*
rely
upon
it
,
if
you
will
tell
me
I
may
so
far
trust
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
,
I
assure
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
young
,
as
you
see
;
I
am
alone
,
as
you
see
.
In
coming
to
you
,
sir
,
*NL*
I
have
no
advice
or
encouragement
beyond
my
own
hope
.
'
He
thought
,
`
But
*NL*
that
is
very
strong
,
'
as
he
followed
the
momentary
upward
glance
of
her
*NL*
eyes
.
He
thought
besides
,
`
This
is
a
very
odd
beginning
.
I
do
n't
see
*NL*
where
we
are
going
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
,
'
said
Sissy
,
`
you
have
already
guessed
whom
I
left
just
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
been
in
the
greatest
concern
and
uneasiness
during
the
last
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
-LRB-
which
have
appeared
as
many
years
-RRB-
,
'
he
returned
,
*NL*
`
on
a
lady
's
account
.
The
hopes
I
have
been
encouraged
to
form
that
you
*NL*
come
from
that
lady
,
do
not
deceive
me
,
I
trust
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
left
her
within
an
hour
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
--
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
her
father
's
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Harthouse
's
face
lengthened
in
spite
of
his
coolness
,
and
his
*NL*
perplexity
increased
.
`
Then
I
certainly
,
'
he
thought
,
`
do
_
not
_
see
*NL*
where
we
are
going

*NL*
`
She
hurried
there
last
night
.
She
arrived
there
in
great
agitation
,
and
*NL*
was
insensible
all
through
the
night
.
I
live
at
her
father
's
,
and
was
*NL*
with
her
.
You
may
be
sure
,
sir
,
you
will
never
see
her
again
as
long
as
*NL*
you
live
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Harthouse
drew
a
long
breath
;
and
,
if
ever
man
found
himself
in
the
*NL*
position
of
not
knowing
what
to
say
,
made
the
discovery
beyond
all
*NL*
question
that
he
was
so
circumstanced
.
The
child-like
ingenuousness
with
*NL*
which
his
visitor
spoke
,
her
modest
fearlessness
,
her
truthfulness
which
*NL*
put
all
artifice
aside
,
her
entire
forgetfulness
of
herself
in
her
*NL*
earnest
quiet
holding
to
the
object
with
which
she
had
come
;
all
this
,
*NL*
together
with
her
reliance
on
his
easily
given
promise
--
which
in
itself
*NL*
shamed
him
--
presented
something
in
which
he
was
so
inexperienced
,
and
*NL*
against
which
he
knew
any
of
his
usual
weapons
would
fall
so
powerless
;
*NL*
that
not
a
word
could
he
rally
to
his
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
startling
an
announcement
,
so
confidently
made
,
and
by
such
lips
,
is
*NL*
really
disconcerting
in
the
last
degree
.
May
I
be
permitted
to
inquire
,
*NL*
if
you
are
charged
to
convey
that
information
to
me
in
those
hopeless
*NL*
words
,
by
the
lady
of
whom
we
speak
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
no
charge
from
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
drowning
man
catches
at
the
straw
.
With
no
disrespect
for
your
*NL*
judgment
,
and
with
no
doubt
of
your
sincerity
,
excuse
my
saying
that
I
*NL*
cling
to
the
belief
that
there
is
yet
hope
that
I
am
not
condemned
to
*NL*
perpetual
exile
from
that
lady
's
presence
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
not
the
least
hope
.
The
first
object
of
my
coming
here
,
sir
,
*NL*
is
to
assure
you
that
you
must
believe
that
there
is
no
more
hope
of
your
*NL*
ever
speaking
with
her
again
,
than
there
would
be
if
she
had
died
when
*NL*
she
came
home
last
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Must
believe
?
But
if
I
ca
n't
--
or
if
I
should
,
by
infirmity
of
nature
,
be
*NL*
obstinate
--
and
wo
n't
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
still
true
.
There
is
no
hope
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
James
Harthouse
looked
at
her
with
an
incredulous
smile
upon
his
lips
;
*NL*
but
her
mind
looked
over
and
beyond
him
,
and
the
smile
was
quite
thrown
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bit
his
lip
,
and
took
a
little
time
for
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
If
it
should
unhappily
appear
,
'
he
said
,
`
after
due
pains
and
*NL*
duty
on
my
part
,
that
I
am
brought
to
a
position
so
desolate
as
this
*NL*
banishment
,
I
shall
not
become
the
lady
's
persecutor
.
But
you
said
you
*NL*
had
no
commission
from
her
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
only
the
commission
of
my
love
for
her
,
and
her
love
for
me
.
I
*NL*
have
no
other
trust
,
than
that
I
have
been
with
her
since
she
came
home
,
*NL*
and
that
she
has
given
me
her
confidence
.
I
have
no
further
trust
,
than
*NL*
that
I
know
something
of
her
character
and
her
marriage
.
O
Mr.
*NL*
Harthouse
,
I
think
you
had
that
trust
too
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
touched
in
the
cavity
where
his
heart
should
have
been
--
in
that
*NL*
nest
of
addled
eggs
,
where
the
birds
of
heaven
would
have
lived
if
they
*NL*
had
not
been
whistled
away
--
by
the
fervour
of
this
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
not
a
moral
sort
of
fellow
,
'
he
said
,
`
and
I
never
make
any
*NL*
pretensions
to
the
character
of
a
moral
sort
of
fellow
.
I
am
as
immoral
*NL*
as
need
be
.
At
the
same
time
,
in
bringing
any
distress
upon
the
lady
who
*NL*
is
the
subject
of
the
present
conversation
,
or
in
unfortunately
*NL*
compromising
her
in
any
way
,
or
in
committing
myself
by
any
expression
of
*NL*
sentiments
towards
her
,
not
perfectly
reconcilable
with
--
in
fact
with
--
the
*NL*
domestic
hearth
;
or
in
taking
any
advantage
of
her
father
's
being
a
*NL*
machine
,
or
of
her
brother
's
being
a
whelp
,
or
of
her
husband
's
being
a
*NL*
bear
;
I
beg
to
be
allowed
to
assure
you
that
I
have
had
no
particularly
*NL*
evil
intentions
,
but
have
glided
on
from
one
step
to
another
with
a
*NL*
smoothness
so
perfectly
diabolical
,
that
I
had
not
the
slightest
idea
the
*NL*
catalogue
was
half
so
long
until
I
began
to
turn
it
over
.
Whereas
I
*NL*
find
,
'
said
Mr.
James
Harthouse
,
in
conclusion
,
`
that
it
is
really
in
*NL*
several
volumes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
said
all
this
in
his
frivolous
way
,
the
way
seemed
,
for
that
*NL*
once
,
a
conscious
polishing
of
but
an
ugly
surface
.
He
was
silent
for
a
*NL*
moment
;
and
then
proceeded
with
a
more
self-possessed
air
,
though
with
*NL*
traces
of
vexation
and
disappointment
that
would
not
be
polished
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
what
has
been
just
now
represented
to
me
,
in
a
manner
I
find
it
*NL*
impossible
to
doubt
--
I
know
of
hardly
any
other
source
from
which
I
could
*NL*
have
accepted
it
so
readily
--
I
feel
bound
to
say
to
you
,
in
whom
the
*NL*
confidence
you
have
mentioned
has
been
reposed
,
that
I
can
not
refuse
to
*NL*
contemplate
the
possibility
-LRB-
however
unexpected
-RRB-
of
my
seeing
the
lady
no
*NL*
more
.
I
am
solely
to
blame
for
the
thing
having
come
to
this
--
and
--
and
,
I
*NL*
can
not
say
,
'
he
added
,
rather
hard
up
for
a
general
peroration
,
`
that
I
*NL*
have
any
sanguine
expectation
of
ever
becoming
a
moral
sort
of
fellow
,
or
*NL*
that
I
have
any
belief
in
any
moral
sort
of
fellow
whatever
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sissy
's
face
sufficiently
showed
that
her
appeal
to
him
was
not
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
spoke
,
'
he
resumed
,
as
she
raised
her
eyes
to
him
again
,
`
of
your
*NL*
first
object
.
I
may
assume
that
there
is
a
second
to
be
mentioned
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
you
oblige
me
by
confiding
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Harthouse
,
'
returned
Sissy
,
with
a
blending
of
gentleness
and
*NL*
steadiness
that
quite
defeated
him
,
and
with
a
simple
confidence
in
his
*NL*
being
bound
to
do
what
she
required
,
that
held
him
at
a
singular
*NL*
disadvantage
,
`
the
only
reparation
that
remains
with
you
,
is
to
leave
*NL*
here
immediately
and
finally
.
I
am
quite
sure
that
you
can
mitigate
in
*NL*
no
other
way
the
wrong
and
harm
you
have
done
.
I
am
quite
sure
that
it
*NL*
is
the
only
compensation
you
have
left
it
in
your
power
to
make
.
I
do
*NL*
not
say
that
it
is
much
,
or
that
it
is
enough
;
but
it
is
something
,
and
*NL*
it
is
necessary
.
Therefore
,
though
without
any
other
authority
than
I
*NL*
have
given
you
,
and
even
without
the
knowledge
of
any
other
person
than
*NL*
yourself
and
myself
,
I
ask
you
to
depart
from
this
place
to-night
,
under
*NL*
an
obligation
never
to
return
to
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
had
asserted
any
influence
over
him
beyond
her
plain
faith
in
the
*NL*
truth
and
right
of
what
she
said
;
if
she
had
concealed
the
least
doubt
or
*NL*
irresolution
,
or
had
harboured
for
the
best
purpose
any
reserve
or
*NL*
pretence
;
if
she
had
shown
,
or
felt
,
the
lightest
trace
of
any
*NL*
sensitiveness
to
his
ridicule
or
his
astonishment
,
or
any
remonstrance
he
*NL*
might
offer
;
he
would
have
carried
it
against
her
at
this
point
.
But
he
*NL*
could
as
easily
have
changed
a
clear
sky
by
looking
at
it
in
surprise
,
as
*NL*
affect
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
do
you
know
,
'
he
asked
,
quite
at
a
loss
,
`
the
extent
of
what
you
*NL*
ask
?
You
probably
are
not
aware
that
I
am
here
on
a
public
kind
of
*NL*
business
,
preposterous
enough
in
itself
,
but
which
I
have
gone
in
for
,
*NL*
and
sworn
by
,
and
am
supposed
to
be
devoted
to
in
quite
a
desperate
*NL*
manner
?
You
probably
are
not
aware
of
that
,
but
I
assure
you
it
's
the
*NL*
fact
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
no
effect
on
Sissy
,
fact
or
no
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Besides
which
,
'
said
Mr.
Harthouse
,
taking
a
turn
or
two
across
the
*NL*
room
,
dubiously
,
`
it
's
so
alarmingly
absurd
.
It
would
make
a
man
so
*NL*
ridiculous
,
after
going
in
for
these
fellows
,
to
back
out
in
such
an
*NL*
incomprehensible
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
quite
sure
,
'
repeated
Sissy
,
`
that
it
is
the
only
reparation
in
*NL*
your
power
,
sir
.
I
am
quite
sure
,
or
I
would
not
have
come
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
her
face
,
and
walked
about
again
.
`
Upon
my
soul
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
to
say
.
So
immensely
absurd
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
fell
to
his
lot
,
now
,
to
stipulate
for
secrecy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
were
to
do
such
a
very
ridiculous
thing
,
'
he
said
,
stopping
again
*NL*
presently
,
and
leaning
against
the
chimney-piece
,
`
it
could
only
be
in
*NL*
the
most
inviolable
confidence
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
trust
to
you
,
sir
,
'
returned
Sissy
,
`
and
you
will
trust
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
His
leaning
against
the
chimney-piece
reminded
him
of
the
night
with
the
*NL*
whelp
.
It
was
the
self-same
chimney-piece
,
and
somehow
he
felt
as
if
*NL*
_
he
_
were
the
whelp
to-night
.
He
could
make
no
way
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
a
man
never
was
placed
in
a
more
ridiculous
position
,
'
he
*NL*
said
,
after
looking
down
,
and
looking
up
,
and
laughing
,
and
frowning
,
and
*NL*
walking
off
,
and
walking
back
again
.
`
But
I
see
no
way
out
of
it
.
What
*NL*
will
be
,
will
be
.
_
This
_
will
be
,
I
suppose
.
I
must
take
off
myself
,
I
*NL*
imagine
--
in
short
,
I
engage
to
do
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sissy
rose
.
She
was
not
surprised
by
the
result
,
but
she
was
happy
in
*NL*
it
,
and
her
face
beamed
brightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
permit
me
to
say
,
'
continued
Mr.
James
Harthouse
,
`
that
I
doubt
*NL*
if
any
other
ambassador
,
or
ambassadress
,
could
have
addressed
me
with
*NL*
the
same
success
.
I
must
not
only
regard
myself
as
being
in
a
very
*NL*
ridiculous
position
,
but
as
being
vanquished
at
all
points
.
Will
you
*NL*
allow
me
the
privilege
of
remembering
my
enemy
's
name
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
My
_
name

said
the
ambassadress

possibly
care
to
know

to-night

`
Pardon
my
curiosity
at
parting

Related
to

family

'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
only
a
poor
girl
,
'
returned
Sissy
.
'
I
was
separated
from
my
*NL*
father
--
he
was
only
a
stroller
--
and
taken
pity
on
by
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
I
have
*NL*
lived
in
the
house
ever
since
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
wanted
this
to
complete
the
defeat
,
'
said
Mr.
James
Harthouse
,
*NL*
sinking
,
with
a
resigned
air
,
on
the
sofa
,
after
standing
transfixed
a
*NL*
little
while
.
`
The
defeat
may
now
be
considered
perfectly
accomplished
.
*NL*
Only
a
poor
girl
--
only
a
stroller
--
only
James
Harthouse
made
nothing
*NL*
of
--
only
James
Harthouse
a
Great
Pyramid
of
failure
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Great
Pyramid
put
it
into
his
head
to
go
up
the
Nile
.
He
took
a
pen
*NL*
upon
the
instant
,
and
wrote
the
following
note
-LRB-
in
appropriate
*NL*
hieroglyphics
-RRB-
to
his
brother
:
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Jack
,
--
All
up
at
Coketown
.
Bored
out
of
the
place
,
and
going
in
*NL*
for
camels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Affectionately
,
*NL*
JEM
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rang
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Send
my
fellow
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Gone
to
bed
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
him
to
get
up
,
and
pack
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
wrote
two
more
notes
.
One
,
to
Mr.
Bounderby
,
announcing
his
*NL*
retirement
from
that
part
of
the
country
,
and
showing
where
he
would
be
*NL*
found
for
the
next
fortnight
.
The
other
,
similar
in
effect
,
to
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
.
Almost
as
soon
as
the
ink
was
dry
upon
their
superscriptions
,
*NL*
he
had
left
the
tall
chimneys
of
Coketown
behind
,
and
was
in
a
railway
*NL*
carriage
,
tearing
and
glaring
over
the
dark
landscape
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moral
sort
of
fellows
might
suppose
that
Mr.
James
Harthouse
derived
*NL*
some
comfortable
reflections
afterwards
,
from
this
prompt
retreat
,
as
one
*NL*
of
his
few
actions
that
made
any
amends
for
anything
,
and
as
a
token
to
*NL*
himself
that
he
had
escaped
the
climax
of
a
very
bad
business
.
But
it
*NL*
was
not
so
,
at
all
.
A
secret
sense
of
having
failed
and
been
*NL*
ridiculous
--
a
dread
of
what
other
fellows
who
went
in
for
similar
sorts
of
*NL*
things
,
would
say
at
his
expense
if
they
knew
it
--
so
oppressed
him
,
that
*NL*
what
was
about
the
very
best
passage
in
his
life
was
the
one
of
all
*NL*
others
he
would
not
have
owned
to
on
any
account
,
and
the
only
one
that
*NL*
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
VERY
DECIDED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
indefatigable
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
a
violent
cold
upon
her
,
her
voice
*NL*
reduced
to
a
whisper
,
and
her
stately
frame
so
racked
by
continual
*NL*
sneezes
that
it
seemed
in
danger
of
dismemberment
,
gave
chase
to
her
*NL*
patron
until
she
found
him
in
the
metropolis
;
and
there
,
majestically
*NL*
sweeping
in
upon
him
at
his
hotel
in
St.
James
's
Street
,
exploded
the
*NL*
combustibles
with
which
she
was
charged
,
and
blew
up
.
Having
executed
*NL*
her
mission
with
infinite
relish
,
this
high-minded
woman
then
fainted
*NL*
away
on
Mr.
Bounderby
's
coat-collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
's
first
procedure
was
to
shake
Mrs.
Sparsit
off
,
and
leave
*NL*
her
to
progress
as
she
might
through
various
stages
of
suffering
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
He
next
had
recourse
to
the
administration
of
potent
*NL*
restoratives
,
such
as
screwing
the
patient
's
thumbs
,
smiting
her
hands
,
*NL*
abundantly
watering
her
face
,
and
inserting
salt
in
her
mouth
.
When
*NL*
these
attentions
had
recovered
her
-LRB-
which
they
speedily
did
-RRB-
,
he
hustled
*NL*
her
into
a
fast
train
without
offering
any
other
refreshment
,
and
carried
*NL*
her
back
to
Coketown
more
dead
than
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Regarded
as
a
classical
ruin
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
was
an
interesting
spectacle
*NL*
on
her
arrival
at
her
journey
's
end
;
but
considered
in
any
other
light
,
*NL*
the
amount
of
damage
she
had
by
that
time
sustained
was
excessive
,
and
*NL*
impaired
her
claims
to
admiration
.
Utterly
heedless
of
the
wear
and
tear
*NL*
of
her
clothes
and
constitution
,
and
adamant
to
her
pathetic
sneezes
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
immediately
crammed
her
into
a
coach
,
and
bore
her
off
to
Stone
*NL*
Lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
bursting
into
his
father-in-law
's
*NL*
room
late
at
night
;
`
here
's
a
lady
here
--
Mrs.
Sparsit
--
you
know
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
--
who
has
something
to
say
to
you
that
will
strike
you
dumb
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
missed
my
letter
!
'
exclaimed
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
surprised
by
the
*NL*
apparition
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Missed
your
letter
,
sir
!
'
bawled
Bounderby
.
`
The
present
time
is
no
*NL*
time
for
letters
.
No
man
shall
talk
to
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
*NL*
about
letters
,
with
his
mind
in
the
state
it
's
in
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bounderby
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
in
a
tone
of
temperate
remonstrance
,
'
I
*NL*
speak
of
a
very
special
letter
I
have
written
to
you
,
in
reference
to
*NL*
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tom
Gradgrind
,
'
replied
Bounderby
,
knocking
the
flat
of
his
hand
several
*NL*
times
with
great
vehemence
on
the
table
,
'
I
speak
of
a
very
special
*NL*
messenger
that
has
come
to
me
,
in
reference
to
Louisa
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
stand
forward
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
That
unfortunate
lady
hereupon
essaying
to
offer
testimony
,
without
any
*NL*
voice
and
with
painful
gestures
expressive
of
an
inflamed
throat
,
became
*NL*
so
aggravating
and
underwent
so
many
facial
contortions
,
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
unable
to
bear
it
,
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
shook
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
ca
n't
get
it
out
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
leave
_
me
_
to
get
it
*NL*
out
.
This
is
not
a
time
for
a
lady
,
however
highly
connected
,
to
be
*NL*
totally
inaudible
,
and
seemingly
swallowing
marbles
.
Tom
Gradgrind
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
latterly
found
herself
,
by
accident
,
in
a
situation
to
overhear
a
*NL*
conversation
out
of
doors
between
your
daughter
and
your
precious
*NL*
gentleman-friend
,
Mr.
James
Harthouse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
!
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
Indeed
!
'
cried
Bounderby
.
`
And
in
that
conversation
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
its
tenor
,
Bounderby
.
I
know
what
*NL*
passed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
?
Perhaps
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
staring
with
all
his
might
at
his
so
*NL*
quiet
and
assuasive
father-in-law
,
`
you
know
where
your
daughter
is
at
*NL*
the
present
time
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Undoubtedly
.
She
is
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Bounderby
,
let
me
beg
you
to
restrain
these
loud
out-breaks
,
on
*NL*
all
accounts
.
Louisa
is
here
.
The
moment
she
could
detach
herself
from
*NL*
that
interview
with
the
person
of
whom
you
speak
,
and
whom
I
deeply
*NL*
regret
to
have
been
the
means
of
introducing
to
you
,
Louisa
hurried
here
,
*NL*
for
protection
.
I
myself
had
not
been
at
home
many
hours
,
when
I
*NL*
received
her
--
here
,
in
this
room
.
She
hurried
by
the
train
to
town
,
she
*NL*
ran
from
town
to
this
house
,
through
a
raging
storm
,
and
presented
*NL*
herself
before
me
in
a
state
of
distraction
.
Of
course
,
she
has
remained
*NL*
here
ever
since
.
Let
me
entreat
you
,
for
your
own
sake
and
for
hers
,
to
*NL*
be
more
quiet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
silently
gazed
about
him
for
some
moments
,
in
every
*NL*
direction
except
Mrs.
Sparsit
's
direction
;
and
then
,
abruptly
turning
*NL*
upon
the
niece
of
Lady
Scadgers
,
said
to
that
wretched
woman
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
ma'am
!
We
shall
be
happy
to
hear
any
little
apology
you
may
think
*NL*
proper
to
offer
,
for
going
about
the
country
at
express
pace
,
with
no
*NL*
other
luggage
than
a
Cock-and-a-Bull
,
ma'am
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
whispered
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
my
nerves
are
at
present
too
much
shaken
,
*NL*
and
my
health
is
at
present
too
much
impaired
,
in
your
service
,
to
admit
*NL*
of
my
doing
more
than
taking
refuge
in
tears
.
'
-LRB-
Which
she
did
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
without
making
any
observation
to
you
*NL*
that
may
not
be
made
with
propriety
to
a
woman
of
good
family
,
what
I
*NL*
have
got
to
add
to
that
,
is
that
there
is
something
else
in
which
it
*NL*
appears
to
me
you
may
take
refuge
,
namely
,
a
coach
.
And
the
coach
in
*NL*
which
we
came
here
being
at
the
door
,
you
'll
allow
me
to
hand
you
down
to
*NL*
it
,
and
pack
you
home
to
the
Bank
:
where
the
best
course
for
you
to
*NL*
pursue
,
will
be
to
put
your
feet
into
the
hottest
water
you
can
bear
,
and
*NL*
take
a
glass
of
scalding
rum
and
butter
after
you
get
into
bed
.
'
With
*NL*
these
words
,
Mr.
Bounderby
extended
his
right
hand
to
the
weeping
lady
,
*NL*
and
escorted
her
to
the
conveyance
in
question
,
shedding
many
plaintive
*NL*
sneezes
by
the
way
.
He
soon
returned
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
as
you
showed
me
in
your
face
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
that
you
wanted
to
*NL*
speak
to
me
,
'
he
resumed
,
`
here
I
am
.
But
,
I
am
not
in
a
very
agreeable
*NL*
state
,
I
tell
you
plainly
:
not
relishing
this
business
,
even
as
it
is
,
*NL*
and
not
considering
that
I
am
at
any
time
as
dutifully
and
submissively
*NL*
treated
by
your
daughter
,
as
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
ought
to
be
*NL*
treated
by
his
wife
.
You
have
your
opinion
,
I
dare
say
;
and
I
have
mine
,
*NL*
I
know
.
If
you
mean
to
say
anything
to
me
to-night
,
that
goes
against
*NL*
this
candid
remark
,
you
had
better
let
it
alone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
it
will
be
observed
,
being
much
softened
,
Mr.
Bounderby
*NL*
took
particular
pains
to
harden
himself
at
all
points
.
It
was
his
*NL*
amiable
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Bounderby
,
'
Mr.
Gradgrind
began
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
you
'll
excuse
me
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
but
I
do
n't
want
to
be
too
*NL*
dear
.
That
,
to
start
with
.
When
I
begin
to
be
dear
to
a
man
,
I
*NL*
generally
find
that
his
intention
is
to
come
over
me
.
I
am
not
speaking
*NL*
to
you
politely
;
but
,
as
you
are
aware
,
I
am
_
not
_
polite
.
If
you
like
*NL*
politeness
,
you
know
where
to
get
it
.
You
have
your
gentleman-friends
,
*NL*
you
know
,
and
they
'll
serve
you
with
as
much
of
the
article
as
you
want
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
keep
it
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bounderby
,
'
urged
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
we
are
all
liable
to
mistakes
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
you
could
n't
make
'em
,
'
interrupted
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
I
thought
so
.
But
,
I
say
we
are
all
liable
to
mistakes
and
I
*NL*
should
feel
sensible
of
your
delicacy
,
and
grateful
for
it
,
if
you
would
*NL*
spare
me
these
references
to
Harthouse
.
I
shall
not
associate
him
in
our
*NL*
conversation
with
your
intimacy
and
encouragement
;
pray
do
not
persist
in
*NL*
connecting
him
with
mine
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
mentioned
his
name
!
'
said
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
!
'
returned
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
with
a
patient
,
even
a
submissive
,
*NL*
air
.
And
he
sat
for
a
little
while
pondering
.
`
Bounderby
,
I
see
reason
*NL*
to
doubt
whether
we
have
ever
quite
understood
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
do
you
mean
by
We
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
say
I
,
then
,
'
he
returned
,
in
answer
to
the
coarsely
blurted
*NL*
question
;
'
I
doubt
whether
I
have
understood
Louisa
.
I
doubt
whether
I
*NL*
have
been
quite
right
in
the
manner
of
her
education
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
you
hit
it
,
'
returned
Bounderby
.
`
There
I
agree
with
you
.
You
*NL*
have
found
it
out
at
last
,
have
you
?
Education
!
I
'll
tell
you
what
*NL*
education
is
--
To
be
tumbled
out
of
doors
,
neck
and
crop
,
and
put
upon
the
*NL*
shortest
allowance
of
everything
except
blows
.
That
's
what
_
I
_
call
*NL*
education
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
your
good
sense
will
perceive
,
'
Mr.
Gradgrind
remonstrated
in
*NL*
all
humility
,
`
that
whatever
the
merits
of
such
a
system
may
be
,
it
would
*NL*
be
difficult
of
general
application
to
girls
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
see
it
at
all
,
sir
,
'
returned
the
obstinate
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
sighed
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
we
will
not
enter
into
the
question
.
I
*NL*
assure
you
I
have
no
desire
to
be
controversial
.
I
seek
to
repair
what
*NL*
is
amiss
,
if
I
possibly
can
;
and
I
hope
you
will
assist
me
in
a
good
*NL*
spirit
,
Bounderby
,
for
I
have
been
very
much
distressed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
yet
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
with
determined
obstinacy
,
*NL*
`
and
therefore
I
wo
n't
make
any
promises
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
the
course
of
a
few
hours
,
my
dear
Bounderby
,
'
Mr.
Gradgrind
*NL*
proceeded
,
in
the
same
depressed
and
propitiatory
manner
,
'
I
appear
to
*NL*
myself
to
have
become
better
informed
as
to
Louisa
's
character
,
than
in
*NL*
previous
years
.
The
enlightenment
has
been
painfully
forced
upon
me
,
and
*NL*
the
discovery
is
not
mine
.
I
think
there
are
--
Bounderby
,
you
will
be
*NL*
surprised
to
hear
me
say
this
--
I
think
there
are
qualities
in
Louisa
,
*NL*
which
--
which
have
been
harshly
neglected
,
and
--
and
a
little
perverted
.
*NL*
And
--
and
I
would
suggest
to
you
,
that
--
that
if
you
would
kindly
meet
me
in
*NL*
a
timely
endeavour
to
leave
her
to
her
better
nature
for
a
while
--
and
to
*NL*
encourage
it
to
develop
itself
by
tenderness
and
consideration
--
it
--
it
*NL*
would
be
the
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
of
us
.
Louisa
,
'
said
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
,
shading
his
face
with
his
hand
,
`
has
always
been
my
favourite
*NL*
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
blustrous
Bounderby
crimsoned
and
swelled
to
such
an
extent
on
*NL*
hearing
these
words
,
that
he
seemed
to
be
,
and
probably
was
,
on
the
brink
*NL*
of
a
fit
.
With
his
very
ears
a
bright
purple
shot
with
crimson
,
he
pent
*NL*
up
his
indignation
,
however
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'd
like
to
keep
her
here
for
a
time
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
--
I
had
intended
to
recommend
,
my
dear
Bounderby
,
that
you
should
allow
*NL*
Louisa
to
remain
here
on
a
visit
,
and
be
attended
by
Sissy
-LRB-
I
mean
of
*NL*
course
Cecilia
Jupe
-RRB-
,
who
understands
her
,
and
in
whom
she
trusts
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
gather
from
all
this
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
standing
up
with
*NL*
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
`
that
you
are
of
opinion
that
there
's
what
*NL*
people
call
some
incompatibility
between
Loo
Bounderby
and
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
fear
there
is
at
present
a
general
incompatibility
between
Louisa
,
*NL*
and
--
and
--
and
almost
all
the
relations
in
which
I
have
placed
her
,
'
was
her
*NL*
father
's
sorrowful

*NL*
`
Now
,
look
you
here
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
'
said
Bounderby
the
flushed
,
*NL*
confronting
him
with
his
legs
wide
apart
,
his
hands
deeper
in
his
*NL*
pockets
,
and
his
hair
like
a
hayfield
wherein
his
windy
anger
was
*NL*
boisterous
.
`
You
have
said
your
say
;
I
am
going
to
say
mine
.
I
am
a
*NL*
Coketown
man
.
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
.
I
know
the
bricks
of
*NL*
this
town
,
and
I
know
the
works
of
this
town
,
and
I
know
the
chimneys
of
*NL*
this
town
,
and
I
know
the
smoke
of
this
town
,
and
I
know
the
Hands
of
*NL*
this
town
.
I
know
'em
all
pretty
well
.
They
're
real
.
When
a
man
tells
*NL*
me
anything
about
imaginative
qualities
,
I
always
tell
that
man
,
whoever
*NL*
he
is
,
that
I
know
what
he
means
.
He
means
turtle
soup
and
venison
,
with
*NL*
a
gold
spoon
,
and
that
he
wants
to
be
set
up
with
a
coach
and
six
.
*NL*
That
's
what
your
daughter
wants
.
Since
you
are
of
opinion
that
she
ought
*NL*
to
have
what
she
wants
,
I
recommend
you
to
provide
it
for
her
.
Because
,
*NL*
Tom
Gradgrind
,
she
will
never
have
it
from
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bounderby
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
'
I
hoped
,
after
my
entreaty
,
you
would
*NL*
have
taken
a
different
tone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Just
wait
a
bit
,
'
retorted
Bounderby
;
`
you
have
said
your
say
,
I
*NL*
believe
.
I
heard
you
out
;
hear
me
out
,
if
you
please
.
Do
n't
make
*NL*
yourself
a
spectacle
of
unfairness
as
well
as
inconsistency
,
because
,
*NL*
although
I
am
sorry
to
see
Tom
Gradgrind
reduced
to
his
present
position
,
*NL*
I
should
be
doubly
sorry
to
see
him
brought
so
low
as
that
.
Now
,
there
's
*NL*
an
incompatibility
of
some
sort
or
another
,
I
am
given
to
understand
by
*NL*
you
,
between
your
daughter
and
me
.
I
'll
give
_
you
_
to
understand
,
in
*NL*
reply
to
that
,
that
there
unquestionably
is
an
incompatibility
of
the
*NL*
first
magnitude
--
to
be
summed
up
in
this
--
that
your
daughter
do
n't
properly
*NL*
know
her
husband
's
merits
,
and
is
not
impressed
with
such
a
sense
as
*NL*
would
become
her
,
by
George
!
of
the
honour
of
his
alliance
.
That
's
plain
*NL*
speaking
,
I
hope
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bounderby
,
'
urged
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
this
is
unreasonable
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
?
'
said
Bounderby
.
'
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
.
Because
when
*NL*
Tom
Gradgrind
,
with
his
new
lights
,
tells
me
that
what
I
say
is
*NL*
unreasonable
,
I
am
convinced
at
once
it
must
be
devilish
sensible
.
With
*NL*
your
permission
I
am
going
on
.
You
know
my
origin
;
and
you
know
that
for
*NL*
a
good
many
years
of
my
life
I
did
n't
want
a
shoeing-horn
,
in
consequence
*NL*
of
not
having
a
shoe
.
Yet
you
may
believe
or
not
,
as
you
think
proper
,
*NL*
that
there
are
ladies
--
born
ladies
--
belonging
to
families
--
Families
!
--
who
*NL*
next
to
worship
the
ground
I
walk
on
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
discharged
this
like
a
Rocket
,
at
his
father-in-law
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whereas
your
daughter
,
'
proceeded
Bounderby
,
`
is
far
from
being
a
born
*NL*
lady
.
That
you
know
,
yourself
.
Not
that
I
care
a
pinch
of
candle-snuff
*NL*
about
such
things
,
for
you
are
very
well
aware
I
do
n't
;
but
that
such
is
*NL*
the
fact
,
and
you
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
ca
n't
change
it
.
Why
do
I
say
this
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
,
I
fear
,
'
observed
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
in
a
low
voice
,
`
to
spare
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hear
me
out
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
`
and
refrain
from
cutting
in
till
your
*NL*
turn
comes
round
.
I
say
this
,
because
highly
connected
females
have
been
*NL*
astonished
to
see
the
way
in
which
your
daughter
has
conducted
herself
,
*NL*
and
to
witness
her
insensibility
.
They
have
wondered
how
I
have
suffered
*NL*
it
.
And
I
wonder
myself
now
,
and
I
wo
n't
suffer
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bounderby
,
'
returned
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
rising
,
`
the
less
we
say
to-night
*NL*
the
better
,
I
think
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
On
the
contrary
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
the
more
we
say
to-night
,
the
better
,
I
*NL*
think
.
That
is
,
'
the
consideration
checked
him
,
'till
I
have
said
all
I
*NL*
mean
to
say
,
and
then
I
do
n't
care
how
soon
we
stop
.
I
come
to
a
*NL*
question
that
may
shorten
the
business
.
What
do
you
mean
by
the
proposal
*NL*
you
made
just
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
I
mean
,
Bounderby
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
your
visiting
proposition
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
with
an
inflexible
jerk
*NL*
of
the
hayfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
mean
that
I
hope
you
may
be
induced
to
arrange
in
a
friendly
manner
,
*NL*
for
allowing
Louisa
a
period
of
repose
and
reflection
here
,
which
may
*NL*
tend
to
a
gradual
alteration
for
the
better
in
many
respects
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
a
softening
down
of
your
ideas
of
the
incompatibility
?
'
said
*NL*
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
put
it
in
those
terms
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
made
you
think
of
this
?
'
said
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
already
said
,
I
fear
Louisa
has
not
been
understood
.
Is
it
*NL*
asking
too
much
,
Bounderby
,
that
you
,
so
far
her
elder
,
should
aid
in
*NL*
trying
to
set
her
right
?
You
have
accepted
a
great
charge
of
her
;
for
*NL*
better
for
worse
,
for
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
may
have
been
annoyed
by
the
repetition
of
his
own
words
to
*NL*
Stephen
Blackpool
,
but
he
cut
the
quotation
short
with
an
angry
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
!
'
said
he
,
'
I
do
n't
want
to
be
told
about
that
.
I
know
what
I
took
*NL*
her
for
,
as
well
as
you
do
.
Never
you
mind
what
I
took
her
for
;
that
's
*NL*
my
look
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
merely
going
on
to
remark
,
Bounderby
,
that
we
may
all
be
more
or
*NL*
less
in
the
wrong
,
not
even
excepting
you
;
and
that
some
yielding
on
your
*NL*
part
,
remembering
the
trust
you
have
accepted
,
may
not
only
be
an
act
of
*NL*
true
kindness
,
but
perhaps
a
debt
incurred
towards
Louisa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
differently
,
'
blustered
Bounderby
.
'
I
am
going
to
finish
this
*NL*
business
according
to
my
own
opinions
.
Now
,
I
do
n't
want
to
make
a
*NL*
quarrel
of
it
with
you
,
Tom
Gradgrind
.
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
it
would
be
worthy
of
my
reputation
to
quarrel
on
such
a
subject
.
*NL*
As
to
your
gentleman-friend
,
he
may
take
himself
off
,
wherever
he
likes
*NL*
best
.
If
he
falls
in
my
way
,
I
shall
tell
him
my
mind
;
if
he
do
n't
fall
*NL*
in
my
way
,
I
sha
n't
,
for
it
wo
n't
be
worth
my
while
to
do
it
.
As
to
your
*NL*
daughter
,
whom
I
made
Loo
Bounderby
,
and
might
have
done
better
by
*NL*
leaving
Loo
Gradgrind
,
if
she
do
n't
come
home
to-morrow
,
by
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
at
noon
,
I
shall
understand
that
she
prefers
to
stay
away
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
send
her
wearing
apparel
and
so
forth
over
here
,
and
you
'll
take
*NL*
charge
of
her
for
the
future
.
What
I
shall
say
to
people
in
general
,
of
*NL*
the
incompatibility
that
led
to
my
so
laying
down
the
law
,
will
be
this
.
*NL*
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
,
and
I
had
my
bringing-up
;
she
's
the
daughter
of
*NL*
Tom
Gradgrind
,
and
she
had
her
bringing-up
;
and
the
two
horses
would
n't
*NL*
pull
together
.
I
am
pretty
well
known
to
be
rather
an
uncommon
man
,
I
*NL*
believe
;
and
most
people
will
understand
fast
enough
that
it
must
be
a
*NL*
woman
rather
out
of
the
common
,
also
,
who
,
in
the
long
run
,
would
come
up
*NL*
to
my
mark
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
seriously
entreat
you
to
reconsider
this
,
Bounderby
,
'
urged
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
,
`
before
you
commit
yourself
to
such
a
decision
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
always
come
to
a
decision
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
tossing
his
hat
on
:
`
and
*NL*
whatever
I
do
,
I
do
at
once
.
I
should
be
surprised
at
Tom
Gradgrind
's
*NL*
addressing
such
a
remark
to
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
knowing
what
he
*NL*
knows
of
him
,
if
I
could
be
surprised
by
anything
Tom
Gradgrind
did
,
*NL*
after
his
making
himself
a
party
to
sentimental
humbug
.
I
have
given
you
*NL*
my
decision
,
and
I
have
got
no
more
to
say
.
Good
night
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
Mr.
Bounderby
went
home
to
his
town
house
to
bed
.
At
five
minutes
*NL*
past
twelve
o'clock
next
day
,
he
directed
Mrs.
Bounderby
's
property
to
be
*NL*
carefully
packed
up
and
sent
to
Tom
Gradgrind
's
;
advertised
his
country
*NL*
retreat
for
sale
by
private
contract
;
and
resumed
a
bachelor
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
LOST
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
robbery
at
the
Bank
had
not
languished
before
,
and
did
not
cease
to
*NL*
occupy
a
front
place
in
the
attention
of
the
principal
of
that
*NL*
establishment
now
.
In
boastful
proof
of
his
promptitude
and
activity
,
as
*NL*
a
remarkable
man
,
and
a
self-made
man
,
and
a
commercial
wonder
more
*NL*
admirable
than
Venus
,
who
had
risen
out
of
the
mud
instead
of
the
sea
,
he
*NL*
liked
to
show
how
little
his
domestic
affairs
abated
his
business
ardour
.
*NL*
Consequently
,
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
his
resumed
bachelorhood
,
he
even
*NL*
advanced
upon
his
usual
display
of
bustle
,
and
every
day
made
such
a
rout
*NL*
in
renewing
his
investigations
into
the
robbery
,
that
the
officers
who
*NL*
had
it
in
hand
almost
wished
it
had
never
been
committed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
at
fault
too
,
and
off
the
scent
.
Although
they
had
been
so
*NL*
quiet
since
the
first
outbreak
of
the
matter
,
that
most
people
really
did
*NL*
suppose
it
to
have
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
,
nothing
new
occurred
.
No
*NL*
implicated
man
or
woman
took
untimely
courage
,
or
made
a
self-betraying
*NL*
step
.
More
remarkable
yet
,
Stephen
Blackpool
could
not
be
heard
of
,
and
*NL*
the
mysterious
old
woman
remained
a
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
having
come
to
this
pass
,
and
showing
no
latent
signs
of
stirring
*NL*
beyond
it
,
the
upshot
of
Mr.
Bounderby
's
investigations
was
,
that
he
*NL*
resolved
to
hazard
a
bold
burst
.
He
drew
up
a
placard
,
offering
Twenty
*NL*
Pounds
reward
for
the
apprehension
of
Stephen
Blackpool
,
suspected
of
*NL*
complicity
in
the
robbery
of
Coketown
Bank
on
such
a
night
;
he
described
*NL*
the
said
Stephen
Blackpool
by
dress
,
complexion
,
estimated
height
,
and
*NL*
manner
,
as
minutely
as
he
could
;
he
recited
how
he
had
left
the
town
,
and
*NL*
in
what
direction
he
had
been
last
seen
going
;
he
had
the
whole
printed
*NL*
in
great
black
letters
on
a
staring
broadsheet
;
and
he
caused
the
walls
*NL*
to
be
posted
with
it
in
the
dead
of
night
,
so
that
it
should
strike
upon
*NL*
the
sight
of
the
whole
population
at
one
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
factory-bells
had
need
to
ring
their
loudest
that
morning
to
disperse
*NL*
the
groups
of
workers
who
stood
in
the
tardy
daybreak
,
collected
round
*NL*
the
placards
,
devouring
them
with
eager
eyes
.
Not
the
least
eager
of
the
*NL*
eyes
assembled
,
were
the
eyes
of
those
who
could
not
read
.
These
people
,
*NL*
as
they
listened
to
the
friendly
voice
that
read
aloud
--
there
was
always
*NL*
some
such
ready
to
help
them
--
stared
at
the
characters
which
meant
so
much
*NL*
with
a
vague
awe
and
respect
that
would
have
been
half
ludicrous
,
if
any
*NL*
aspect
of
public
ignorance
could
ever
be
otherwise
than
threatening
and
*NL*
full
of
evil
.
Many
ears
and
eyes
were
busy
with
a
vision
of
the
matter
*NL*
of
these
placards
,
among
turning
spindles
,
rattling
looms
,
and
whirling
*NL*
wheels
,
for
hours
afterwards
;
and
when
the
Hands
cleared
out
again
into
*NL*
the
streets
,
there
were
still
as
many
readers
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slackbridge
,
the
delegate
,
had
to
address
his
audience
too
that
night
;
*NL*
and
Slackbridge
had
obtained
a
clean
bill
from
the
printer
,
and
had
*NL*
brought
it
in
his
pocket
.
Oh
,
my
friends
and
fellow-countrymen
,
the
*NL*
down-trodden
operatives
of
Coketown
,
oh
,
my
fellow-brothers
and
*NL*
fellow-workmen
and
fellow-citizens
and
fellow-men
,
what
a
to-do
was
*NL*
there
,
when
Slackbridge
unfolded
what
he
called
`
that
damning
document
,
'
*NL*
and
held
it
up
to
the
gaze
,
and
for
the
execration
of
the
working-man
*NL*
community
!
`
Oh
,
my
fellow-men
,
behold
of
what
a
traitor
in
the
camp
of
*NL*
those
great
spirits
who
are
enrolled
upon
the
holy
scroll
of
Justice
and
*NL*
of
Union
,
is
appropriately
capable
!
Oh
,
my
prostrate
friends
,
with
the
*NL*
galling
yoke
of
tyrants
on
your
necks
and
the
iron
foot
of
despotism
*NL*
treading
down
your
fallen
forms
into
the
dust
of
the
earth
,
upon
which
*NL*
right
glad
would
your
oppressors
be
to
see
you
creeping
on
your
bellies
*NL*
all
the
days
of
your
lives
,
like
the
serpent
in
the
garden
--
oh
,
my
*NL*
brothers
,
and
shall
I
as
a
man
not
add
,
my
sisters
too
,
what
do
you
say
,
*NL*
_
now
_
,
of
Stephen
Blackpool
,
with
a
slight
stoop
in
his
shoulders
and
*NL*
about
five
foot
seven
in
height
,
as
set
forth
in
this
degrading
and
*NL*
disgusting
document
,
this
blighting
bill
,
this
pernicious
placard
,
this
*NL*
abominable
advertisement
;
and
with
what
majesty
of
denouncement
will
you
*NL*
crush
the
viper
,
who
would
bring
this
stain
and
shame
upon
the
God-like
*NL*
race
that
happily
has
cast
him
out
for
ever
!
Yes
,
my
compatriots
,
*NL*
happily
cast
him
out
and
sent
him
forth
!
For
you
remember
how
he
stood
*NL*
here
before
you
on
this
platform
;
you
remember
how
,
face
to
face
and
foot
*NL*
to
foot
,
I
pursued
him
through
all
his
intricate
windings
;
you
remember
*NL*
how
he
sneaked
and
slunk
,
and
sidled
,
and
splitted
of
straws
,
until
,
with
*NL*
not
an
inch
of
ground
to
which
to
cling
,
I
hurled
him
out
from
amongst
*NL*
us
:
an
object
for
the
undying
finger
of
scorn
to
point
at
,
and
for
the
*NL*
avenging
fire
of
every
free
and
thinking
mind
to
scorch
and
scar
!
And
*NL*
now
,
my
friends
--
my
labouring
friends
,
for
I
rejoice
and
triumph
in
that
*NL*
stigma
--
my
friends
whose
hard
but
honest
beds
are
made
in
toil
,
and
whose
*NL*
scanty
but
independent
pots
are
boiled
in
hardship
;
and
now
,
I
say
,
my
*NL*
friends
,
what
appellation
has
that
dastard
craven
taken
to
himself
,
when
,
*NL*
with
the
mask
torn
from
his
features
,
he
stands
before
us
in
all
his
*NL*
native
deformity
,
a
What
?
A
thief
!
A
plunderer
!
A
proscribed
fugitive
,
*NL*
with
a
price
upon
his
head
;
a
fester
and
a
wound
upon
the
noble
character
*NL*
of
the
Coketown
operative
!
Therefore
,
my
band
of
brothers
in
a
sacred
*NL*
bond
,
to
which
your
children
and
your
children
's
children
yet
unborn
have
*NL*
set
their
infant
hands
and
seals
,
I
propose
to
you
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
United
Aggregate
Tribunal
,
ever
watchful
for
your
welfare
,
ever
zealous
*NL*
for
your
benefit
,
that
this
meeting
does
Resolve
:
That
Stephen
Blackpool
,
*NL*
weaver
,
referred
to
in
this
placard
,
having
been
already
solemnly
*NL*
disowned
by
the
community
of
Coketown
Hands
,
the
same
are
free
from
the
*NL*
shame
of
his
misdeeds
,
and
can
not
as
a
class
be
reproached
with
his
*NL*
dishonest
actions
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Slackbridge
;
gnashing
and
perspiring
after
a
prodigious
sort
.
A
few
*NL*
stern
voices
called
out
`
No
!
'
and
a
score
or
two
hailed
,
with
assenting
*NL*
cries
of
`
Hear
,
hear
!
'
the
caution
from
one
man
,
`
Slackbridge
,
y'
or
over
*NL*
hetter
i
n't
;
y'
or
a
goen
too
fast
!
'
But
these
were
pigmies
against
an
*NL*
army
;
the
general
assemblage
subscribed
to
the
gospel
according
to
*NL*
Slackbridge
,
and
gave
three
cheers
for
him
,
as
he
sat
demonstratively
*NL*
panting
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
men
and
women
were
yet
in
the
streets
,
passing
quietly
to
their
*NL*
homes
,
when
Sissy
,
who
had
been
called
away
from
Louisa
some
minutes
*NL*
before
,
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
is
it
?
'
asked
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
Mr.
Bounderby
,
'
said
Sissy
,
timid
of
the
name
,
`
and
your
brother
*NL*
Mr.
Tom
,
and
a
young
woman
who
says
her
name
is
Rachael
,
and
that
you
*NL*
know
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
they
want
,
Sissy
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
want
to
see
you
.
Rachael
has
been
crying
,
and
seems
angry
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Father
,
'
said
Louisa
,
for
he
was
present
,
'
I
can
not
refuse
to
see
them
,
*NL*
for
a
reason
that
will
explain
itself
.
Shall
they
come
in
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
Sissy
went
away
to
bring
them
.
She
*NL*
reappeared
with
them
directly
.
Tom
was
last
;
and
remained
standing
in
*NL*
the
obscurest
part
of
the
room
,
near
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Bounderby
,
'
said
her
husband
,
entering
with
a
cool
nod
,
'
I
do
n't
*NL*
disturb
you
,
I
hope
.
This
is
an
unseasonable
hour
,
but
here
is
a
young
*NL*
woman
who
has
been
making
statements
which
render
my
visit
necessary
.
*NL*
Tom
Gradgrind
,
as
your
son
,
young
Tom
,
refuses
for
some
obstinate
reason
*NL*
or
other
to
say
anything
at
all
about
those
statements
,
good
or
bad
,
I
am
*NL*
obliged
to
confront
her
with
your
daughter
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
seen
me
once
before
,
young
lady
,
'
said
Rachael
,
standing
in
*NL*
front
of
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
coughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
seen
me
,
young
lady
,
'
repeated
Rachael
,
as
she
did
not
answer
,
*NL*
`
once
before
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
coughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Rachael
cast
her
eyes
proudly
towards
Mr.
Bounderby
,
and
said
,
`
Will
you
*NL*
make
it
known
,
young
lady
,
where
,
and
who
was
there
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
went
to
the
house
where
Stephen
Blackpool
lodged
,
on
the
night
of
his
*NL*
discharge
from
his
work
,
and
I
saw
you
there
.
He
was
there
too
;
and
an
*NL*
old
woman
who
did
not
speak
,
and
whom
I
could
scarcely
see
,
stood
in
a
*NL*
dark
corner
.
My
brother
was
with
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
could
n't
you
say
so
,
young
Tom
?
'
demanded
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
promised
my
sister
I
would
n't
.
'
Which
Louisa
hastily
confirmed
.
`
And
*NL*
besides
,
'
said
the
whelp
bitterly
,
`
she
tells
her
own
story
so
precious
*NL*
well
--
and
so
full
--
that
what
business
had
I
to
take
it
out
of
her
mouth
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Say
,
young
lady
,
if
you
please
,
'
pursued
Rachael
,
`
why
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
*NL*
you
ever
came
to
Stephen
's
that
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
felt
compassion
for
him
,
'
said
Louisa
,
her
colour
deepening
,
`
and
I
*NL*
wished
to
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
,
and
wished
to
offer
him
*NL*
assistance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
.
`
Much
flattered
and
obliged
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
you
offer
him
,
'
asked
Rachael
,
'
a
bank-note
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
;
but
he
refused
it
,
and
would
only
take
two
pounds
in
gold
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Rachael
cast
her
eyes
towards
Mr.
Bounderby
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
certainly
!
'
said
Bounderby
.
`
If
you
put
the
question
whether
your
*NL*
ridiculous
and
improbable
account
was
true
or
not
,
I
am
bound
to
say
it
's
*NL*
confirmed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Young
lady
,
'
said
Rachael
,
`
Stephen
Blackpool
is
now
named
as
a
thief
in
*NL*
public
print
all
over
this
town
,
and
where
else
!
There
have
been
a
*NL*
meeting
to-night
where
he
have
been
spoken
of
in
the
same
shameful
way
.
*NL*
Stephen
!
The
honestest
lad
,
the
truest
lad
,
the
best
!
'
Her
indignation
*NL*
failed
her
,
and
she
broke
off
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
,
'
said
Louisa
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
young
lady
,
young
lady
,
'
returned
Rachael
,
'
I
hope
you
may
be
,
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
!
I
ca
n't
say
what
you
may
ha
'
done
!
The
like
of
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
us
,
do
n't
care
for
us
,
do
n't
belong
to
us
.
I
am
not
sure
why
you
*NL*
may
ha
'
come
that
night
.
I
ca
n't
tell
but
what
you
may
ha
'
come
wi
'
some
*NL*
aim
of
your
own
,
not
mindin
to
what
trouble
you
brought
such
as
the
poor
*NL*
lad
.
I
said
then
,
Bless
you
for
coming
;
and
I
said
it
of
my
heart
,
you
*NL*
seemed
to
take
so
pitifully
to
him
;
but
I
do
n't
know
now
,
I
do
n't
know
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
could
not
reproach
her
for
her
unjust
suspicions
;
she
was
so
*NL*
faithful
to
her
idea
of
the
man
,
and
so
afflicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
when
I
think
,
'
said
Rachael
through
her
sobs
,
`
that
the
poor
lad
was
*NL*
so
grateful
,
thinkin
you
so
good
to
him
--
when
I
mind
that
he
put
his
hand
*NL*
over
his
hard-worken
face
to
hide
the
tears
that
you
brought
up
there
--
Oh
,
*NL*
I
hope
you
may
be
sorry
,
and
ha
'
no
bad
cause
to
be
it
;
but
I
do
n't
know
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
a
pretty
article
,
'
growled
the
whelp
,
moving
uneasily
in
his
dark
*NL*
corner
,
`
to
come
here
with
these
precious
imputations
!
You
ought
to
be
*NL*
bundled
out
for
not
knowing
how
to
behave
yourself
,
and
you
would
be
by
*NL*
rights
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
nothing
in
reply
;
and
her
low
weeping
was
the
only
sound
that
*NL*
was
heard
,
until
Mr.
Bounderby
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
!
'
said
he
,
`
you
know
what
you
have
engaged
to
do
.
You
had
better
*NL*
give
your
mind
to
that
;
not
this
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
Deed
,
I
am
loath
,
'
returned
Rachael
,
drying
her
eyes
,
`
that
any
here
*NL*
should
see
me
like
this
;
but
I
wo
n't
be
seen
so
again
.
Young
lady
,
when
*NL*
I
had
read
what
's
put
in
print
of
Stephen
--
and
what
has
just
as
much
truth
*NL*
in
it
as
if
it
had
been
put
in
print
of
you
--
I
went
straight
to
the
Bank
*NL*
to
say
I
knew
where
Stephen
was
,
and
to
give
a
sure
and
certain
promise
*NL*
that
he
should
be
here
in
two
days
.
I
could
n't
meet
wi
'
Mr.
Bounderby
*NL*
then
,
and
your
brother
sent
me
away
,
and
I
tried
to
find
you
,
but
you
was
*NL*
not
to
be
found
,
and
I
went
back
to
work
.
Soon
as
I
come
out
of
the
Mill
*NL*
to-night
,
I
hastened
to
hear
what
was
said
of
Stephen
--
for
I
know
wi
'
*NL*
pride
he
will
come
back
to
shame
it
!
--
and
then
I
went
again
to
seek
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
and
I
found
him
,
and
I
told
him
every
word
I
knew
;
and
he
*NL*
believed
no
word
I
said
,
and
brought
me
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
far
,
that
's
true
enough
,
'
assented
Mr.
Bounderby
,
with
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
and
his
hat
on
.
`
But
I
have
known
you
people
before
to-day
,
*NL*
you
'll
observe
,
and
I
know
you
never
die
for
want
of
talking
.
Now
,
I
*NL*
recommend
you
not
so
much
to
mind
talking
just
now
,
as
doing
.
You
have
*NL*
undertaken
to
do
something
;
all
I
remark
upon
that
at
present
is
,
do
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
written
to
Stephen
by
the
post
that
went
out
this
afternoon
,
as
I
*NL*
have
written
to
him
once
before
sin
'
he
went
away
,
'
said
Rachael
;
`
and
he
*NL*
will
be
here
,
at
furthest
,
in
two
days
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
I
'll
tell
you
something
.
You
are
not
aware
perhaps
,
'
retorted
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
,
`
that
you
yourself
have
been
looked
after
now
and
then
,
not
*NL*
being
considered
quite
free
from
suspicion
in
this
business
,
on
account
*NL*
of
most
people
being
judged
according
to
the
company
they
keep
.
The
*NL*
post-office
has
n't
been
forgotten
either
.
What
I
'll
tell
you
is
,
that
no
*NL*
letter
to
Stephen
Blackpool
has
ever
got
into
it
.
Therefore
,
what
has
*NL*
become
of
yours
,
I
leave
you
to
guess
.
Perhaps
you
're
mistaken
,
and
*NL*
never
wrote
any
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
n't
been
gone
from
here
,
young
lady
,
'
said
Rachael
,
turning
*NL*
appealingly
to
Louisa
,
`
as
much
as
a
week
,
when
he
sent
me
the
only
*NL*
letter
I
have
had
from
him
,
saying
that
he
was
forced
to
seek
work
in
*NL*
another
name
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
by
George
!
'
cried
Bounderby
,
shaking
his
head
,
with
a
whistle
,
`
he
*NL*
changes
his
name
,
does
he
!
That
's
rather
unlucky
,
too
,
for
such
an
*NL*
immaculate
chap
.
It
's
considered
a
little
suspicious
in
Courts
of
*NL*
Justice
,
I
believe
,
when
an
Innocent
happens
to
have
many
names
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
,
'
said
Rachael
,
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
again
,
`
what
,
young
*NL*
lady
,
in
the
name
of
Mercy
,
was
left
the
poor
lad
to
do
!
The
masters
*NL*
against
him
on
one
hand
,
the
men
against
him
on
the
other
,
he
only
wantin
*NL*
to
work
hard
in
peace
,
and
do
what
he
felt
right
.
Can
a
man
have
no
soul
*NL*
of
his
own
,
no
mind
of
his
own
?
Must
he
go
wrong
all
through
wi
'
this
*NL*
side
,
or
must
he
go
wrong
all
through
wi
'
that
,
or
else
be
hunted
like
a
*NL*
hare
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
,
indeed
,
I
pity
him
from
my
heart
,
'
returned
Louisa
;
`
and
I
hope
*NL*
that
he
will
clear
himself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
need
have
no
fear
of
that
,
young
lady
.
He
is
sure
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
the
surer
,
I
suppose
,
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
for
your
refusing
to
*NL*
tell
where
he
is
?
Eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
shall
not
,
through
any
act
of
mine
,
come
back
wi
'
the
unmerited
*NL*
reproach
of
being
brought
back
.
He
shall
come
back
of
his
own
accord
to
*NL*
clear
himself
,
and
put
all
those
that
have
injured
his
good
character
,
*NL*
and
he
not
here
for
its
defence
,
to
shame
.
I
have
told
him
what
has
been
*NL*
done
against
him
,
'
said
Rachael
,
throwing
off
all
distrust
as
a
rock
*NL*
throws
of
the
sea
,
`
and
he
will
be
here
,
at
furthest
,
in
two
days
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Notwithstanding
which
,
'
added
Mr.
Bounderby
,
`
if
he
can
be
laid
hold
of
*NL*
any
sooner
,
he
shall
have
an
earlier
opportunity
of
clearing
himself
.
As
*NL*
to
you
,
I
have
nothing
against
you
;
what
you
came
and
told
me
turns
out
*NL*
to
be
true
,
and
I
have
given
you
the
means
of
proving
it
to
be
true
,
and
*NL*
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
I
wish
you
good
night
all
!
I
must
be
off
to
look
*NL*
a
little
further
into
this
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
came
out
of
his
corner
when
Mr.
Bounderby
moved
,
moved
with
him
,
kept
*NL*
close
to
him
,
and
went
away
with
him
.
The
only
parting
salutation
of
*NL*
which
he
delivered
himself
was
a
sulky
`
Good
night
,
father
!
'
With
a
*NL*
brief
speech
,
and
a
scowl
at
his
sister
,
he
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
his
sheet-anchor
had
come
home
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
had
been
sparing
of
*NL*
speech
.
He
still
sat
silent
,
when
Louisa
mildly
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rachael
,
you
will
not
distrust
me
one
day
,
when
you
know
me
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
goes
against
me
,
'
Rachael
answered
,
in
a
gentler
manner
,
`
to
mistrust
*NL*
any
one
;
but
when
I
am
so
mistrusted
--
when
we
all
are
--
I
can
not
keep
such
*NL*
things
quite
out
of
my
mind
.
I
ask
your
pardon
for
having
done
you
an
*NL*
injury
.
I
do
n't
think
what
I
said
now
.
Yet
I
might
come
to
think
it
*NL*
again
,
wi
'
the
poor
lad
so
wronged
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
you
tell
him
in
your
letter
,
'
inquired
Sissy
,
`
that
suspicion
seemed
*NL*
to
have
fallen
upon
him
,
because
he
had
been
seen
about
the
Bank
at
*NL*
night
?
He
would
then
know
what
he
would
have
to
explain
on
coming
back
,
*NL*
and
would
be
ready
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
dear
,
'
she
returned
;
`
but
I
ca
n't
guess
what
can
have
ever
taken
*NL*
him
there
.
He
never
used
to
go
there
.
It
was
never
in
his
way
.
His
way
*NL*
was
the
same
as
mine
,
and
not
near
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sissy
had
already
been
at
her
side
asking
her
where
she
lived
,
and
*NL*
whether
she
might
come
to-morrow
night
,
to
inquire
if
there
were
news
of
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
doubt
,
'
said
Rachael
,
`
if
he
can
be
here
till
next
day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
will
come
next
night
too
,
'
said
Sissy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Rachael
,
assenting
to
this
,
was
gone
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
lifted
up
his
*NL*
head
,
and
said
to
his
daughter
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Louisa
,
my
dear
,
I
have
never
,
that
I
know
of
,
seen
this
man
.
Do
you
*NL*
believe
him
to
be
implicated
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
I
have
believed
it
,
father
,
though
with
great
difficulty
.
I
do
*NL*
not
believe
it
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
to
say
,
you
once
persuaded
yourself
to
believe
it
,
from
knowing
*NL*
him
to
be
suspected
.
His
appearance
and
manner
;
are
they
so
honest
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
honest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
her
confidence
not
to
be
shaken
!
I
ask
myself
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
*NL*
musing
,
`
does
the
real
culprit
know
of
these
accusations
?
Where
is
he
?
*NL*
Who
is
he
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
His
hair
had
latterly
began
to
change
its
colour
.
As
he
leaned
upon
his
*NL*
hand
again
,
looking
gray
and
old
,
Louisa
,
with
a
face
of
fear
and
pity
,
*NL*
hurriedly
went
over
to
him
,
and
sat
close
at
his
side
.
Her
eyes
by
*NL*
accident
met
Sissy
's
at
the
moment
.
Sissy
flushed
and
started
,
and
*NL*
Louisa
put
her
finger
on
her
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
night
,
when
Sissy
returned
home
and
told
Louisa
that
Stephen
was
not
*NL*
come
,
she
told
it
in
a
whisper
.
Next
night
again
,
when
she
came
home
*NL*
with
the
same
account
,
and
added
that
he
had
not
been
heard
of
,
she
spoke
*NL*
in
the
same
low
frightened
tone
.
From
the
moment
of
that
interchange
of
*NL*
looks
,
they
never
uttered
his
name
,
or
any
reference
to
him
,
aloud
;
nor
*NL*
ever
pursued
the
subject
of
the
robbery
,
when
Mr.
Gradgrind
spoke
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
appointed
days
ran
out
,
three
days
and
nights
ran
out
,
and
*NL*
Stephen
Blackpool
was
not
come
,
and
remained
unheard
of
.
On
the
fourth
*NL*
day
,
Rachael
,
with
unabated
confidence
,
but
considering
her
despatch
to
*NL*
have
miscarried
,
went
up
to
the
Bank
,
and
showed
her
letter
from
him
with
*NL*
his
address
,
at
a
working
colony
,
one
of
many
,
not
upon
the
main
road
,
*NL*
sixty
miles
away
.
Messengers
were
sent
to
that
place
,
and
the
whole
town
*NL*
looked
for
Stephen
to
be
brought
in
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
whole
time
the
whelp
moved
about
with
Mr.
Bounderby
like
his
*NL*
shadow
,
assisting
in
all
the
proceedings
.
He
was
greatly
excited
,
*NL*
horribly
fevered
,
bit
his
nails
down
to
the
quick
,
spoke
in
a
hard
*NL*
rattling
voice
,
and
with
lips
that
were
black
and
burnt
up
.
At
the
hour
*NL*
when
the
suspected
man
was
looked
for
,
the
whelp
was
at
the
station
;
*NL*
offering
to
wager
that
he
had
made
off
before
the
arrival
of
those
who
*NL*
were
sent
in
quest
of
him
,
and
that
he
would
not
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whelp
was
right
.
The
messengers
returned
alone
.
Rachael
's
letter
*NL*
had
gone
,
Rachael
's
letter
had
been
delivered
.
Stephen
Blackpool
had
*NL*
decamped
in
that
same
hour
;
and
no
soul
knew
more
of
him
.
The
only
doubt
*NL*
in
Coketown
was
,
whether
Rachael
had
written
in
good
faith
,
believing
*NL*
that
he
really
would
come
back
,
or
warning
him
to
fly
.
On
this
point
*NL*
opinion
was
divided
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
days
,
seven
days
,
far
on
into
another
week
.
The
wretched
whelp
*NL*
plucked
up
a
ghastly
courage
,
and
began
to
grow
defiant
.
'
_
Was
_
the
*NL*
suspected
fellow
the
thief
?
A
pretty
question
!
If
not
,
where
was
the
*NL*
man
,
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Where
was
the
man
,
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
?
In
the
dead
of
night
*NL*
the
echoes
of
his
own
words
,
which
had
rolled
Heaven
knows
how
far
away
*NL*
in
the
daytime
,
came
back
instead
,
and
abided
by
him
until
morning
.

*NL*
DAY
and

again
,
day
and
night
again
.
No
Stephen
Blackpool
.
Where
*NL*
was
the
man
,
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
?
*NL*
*NL*
Every
night
,
Sissy
went
to
Rachael
's
lodging
,
and
sat
with
her
in
her
*NL*
small
neat
room
.
All
day
,
Rachael
toiled
as
such
people
must
toil
,
*NL*
whatever
their
anxieties
.
The
smoke-serpents
were
indifferent
who
was
*NL*
lost
or
found
,
who
turned
out
bad
or
good
;
the
melancholy
mad
elephants
,
*NL*
like
the
Hard
Fact
men
,
abated
nothing
of
their
set
routine
,
whatever
*NL*
happened
.
Day
and
night
again
,
day
and
night
again
.
The
monotony
was
*NL*
unbroken
.
Even
Stephen
Blackpool
's
disappearance
was
falling
into
the
*NL*
general
way
,
and
becoming
as
monotonous
a
wonder
as
any
piece
of
*NL*
machinery
in
Coketown
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
misdoubt
,
'
said
Rachael
,
`
if
there
is
as
many
as
twenty
left
in
all
*NL*
this
place
,
who
have
any
trust
in
the
poor
dear
lad
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
it
to
Sissy
,
as
they
sat
in
her
lodging
,
lighted
only
by
the
*NL*
lamp
at
the
street
corner
.
Sissy
had
come
there
when
it
was
already
*NL*
dark
,
to
await
her
return
from
work
;
and
they
had
since
sat
at
the
window
*NL*
where
Rachael
had
found
her
,
wanting
no
brighter
light
to
shine
on
their
*NL*
sorrowful
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
it
had
n't
been
mercifully
brought
about
,
that
I
was
to
have
you
to
*NL*
speak
to
,
'
pursued
Rachael
,
`
times
are
,
when
I
think
my
mind
would
not
*NL*
have
kept
right
.
But
I
get
hope
and
strength
through
you
;
and
you
*NL*
believe
that
though
appearances
may
rise
against
him
,
he
will
be
proved
*NL*
clear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
believe
so
,
'
returned
Sissy
,
`
with
my
whole
heart
.
I
feel
so
*NL*
certain
,
Rachael
,
that
the
confidence
you
hold
in
yours
against
all
*NL*
discouragement
,
is
not
like
to
be
wrong
,
that
I
have
no
more
doubt
of
him
*NL*
than
if
I
had
known
him
through
as
many
years
of
trial
as
you
have
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Rachel
,
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
,
`
have
known
*NL*
him
through
them
all
,
to
be
,
according
to
his
quiet
ways
,
so
faithful
to
*NL*
everything
honest
and
good
,
that
if
he
was
never
to
be
heard
of
more
,
and
*NL*
I
was
to
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
,
I
could
say
with
my
last
breath
,
*NL*
God
knows
my
heart
.
I
have
never
once
left
trusting
Stephen
Blackpool
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
all
believe
,
up
at
the
Lodge
,
Rachael
,
that
he
will
be
freed
from
*NL*
suspicion
,
sooner
or
later
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
better
I
know
it
to
be
so
believed
there
,
my
dear
,
'
said
Rachael
,
*NL*
`
and
the
kinder
I
feel
it
that
you
come
away
from
there
,
purposely
to
*NL*
comfort
me
,
and
keep
me
company
,
and
be
seen
wi
'
me
when
I
am
not
yet
*NL*
free
from
all
suspicion
myself
,
the
more
grieved
I
am
that
I
should
ever
*NL*
have
spoken
those
mistrusting
words
to
the
young
lady
.
And
yet
I
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
mistrust
her
now
,
Rachael
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
that
you
have
brought
us
more
together
,
no
.
But
I
ca
n't
at
all
*NL*
times
keep
out
of
my
mind
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
so
sunk
into
a
low
and
slow
communing
with
herself
,
that
Sissy
,
*NL*
sitting
by
her
side
,
was
obliged
to
listen
with
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
at
all
times
keep
out
of
my
mind
,
mistrustings
of
some
one
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
think
who
't
is
,
I
ca
n't
think
how
or
why
it
may
be
done
,
but
I
*NL*
mistrust
that
some
one
has
put
Stephen
out
of
the
way
.
I
mistrust
that
*NL*
by
his
coming
back
of
his
own
accord
,
and
showing
himself
innocent
before
*NL*
them
all
,
some
one
would
be
confounded
,
who
--
to
prevent
that
--
has
stopped
*NL*
him
,
and
put
him
out
of
the
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
a
dreadful
thought
,
'
said
Sissy
,
turning
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
_
is
_
a
dreadful
thought
to
think
he
may
be
murdered
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Sissy
shuddered
,
and
turned
paler
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
it
makes
its
way
into
my
mind
,
dear
,
'
said
Rachael
,
`
and
it
will
*NL*
come
sometimes
,
though
I
do
all
I
can
to
keep
it
out
,
wi
'
counting
on
to
*NL*
high
numbers
as
I
work
,
and
saying
over
and
over
again
pieces
that
I
knew
*NL*
when
I
were
a
child
--
I
fall
into
such
a
wild
,
hot
hurry
,
that
,
however
*NL*
tired
I
am
,
I
want
to
walk
fast
,
miles
and
miles
.
I
must
get
the
better
*NL*
of
this
before
bed-time
.
I
'll
walk
home
wi
'
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
might
fall
ill
upon
the
journey
back
,
'
said
Sissy
,
faintly
offering
a
*NL*
worn-out
scrap
of
hope
;
`
and
in
such
a
case
,
there
are
many
places
on
the
*NL*
road
where
he
might
stop
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
he
is
in
none
of
them
.
He
has
been
sought
for
in
all
,
and
he
's
not
*NL*
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
True
,
'
was
Sissy
's
reluctant
admission
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
'd
walk
the
journey
in
two
days
.
If
he
was
footsore
and
could
n't
*NL*
walk
,
I
sent
him
,
in
the
letter
he
got
,
the
money
to
ride
,
lest
he
should
*NL*
have
none
of
his
own
to
spare

*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
us
hope
that
to-morrow
will
bring
something
better

Rachael

Come
*NL*
into
the
air
!

*NL*
*NL*
Her
gentle
hand
adjusted
Rachael

shawl
upon
her
shining
black
hair
in
*NL*
the
usual
manner
of
her
wearing
it
,
and
they
went
out
.
The
night
being
*NL*
fine
,
little
knots
of
Hands
were
here
and
there
lingering
at
street
*NL*
corners
;
but
it
was
supper-time
with
the
greater
part
of
them
,
and
there
*NL*
were
but
few
people
in
the
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
not
so
hurried
now
,
Rachael
,
and
your
hand
is
cooler

*NL*
*NL*
'
I
get
better
,
dear
,
if
I
can
only
walk
,
and
breathe
a
little
fresh
.
*NL*
`
Times
when
I
ca
n't
,
I
turn
weak
and
confused
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
you
must
not
begin
to
fail
,
Rachael
,
for
you
may
be
wanted
at
any
*NL*
time
to
stand
by
Stephen
.
To-morrow
is
Saturday
.
If
no
news
comes
*NL*
to-morrow
,
let
us
walk
in
the
country
on
Sunday
morning
,
and
strengthen
*NL*
you
for
another
week
.
Will
you
go
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
dear

*NL*
*NL*
They
were
by
this
time
in
the
street
where
Mr.
Bounderby
's
house
stood
.
*NL*
The
way
to
Sissy
's
destination
led
them
past
the
door
,
and
they
were
*NL*
going
straight
towards
it
.
Some
train
had
newly
arrived
in
Coketown
,
*NL*
which
had
put
a
number
of
vehicles
in
motion
,
and
scattered
a
*NL*
considerable
bustle
about
the
town
.
Several
coaches
were
rattling
before
*NL*
them
and
behind
them
as
they
approached
Mr.
Bounderby
's
,
and
one
of
the
*NL*
latter
drew
up
with
such
briskness
as
they
were
in
the
act
of
passing
the
*NL*
house
,
that
they
looked
round
involuntarily
.
The
bright
gaslight
over
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
's
steps
showed
them
Mrs.
Sparsit
in
the
coach
,
in
an
*NL*
ecstasy
of
excitement
,
struggling
to
open
the
door
;
Mrs.
Sparsit
seeing
*NL*
them
at
the
same
moment
,
called
to
them
to
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
coincidence
,
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
as
she
was
released
by
the
*NL*
coachman
.
`
It
's
a
Providence
!
Come
out
,
ma'am
!
'
then
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
*NL*
to
some
one
inside
,
`
come
out
,
or
we
'll
have
you
dragged
out
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
,
no
other
than
the
mysterious
old
woman
descended
.
Whom
Mrs.
*NL*
Sparsit
incontinently
collared
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Leave
her
alone
,
everybody
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
great
energy
.
*NL*
`
Let
nobody
touch
her
.
She
belongs
to
me
.
Come
in
,
ma'am
!
'
then
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
reversing
her
former
word
of
command
.
`
Come
in
,
ma'am
,
or
*NL*
we
'll
have
you
dragged
in
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
spectacle
of
a
matron
of
classical
deportment
,
seizing
an
ancient
*NL*
woman
by
the
throat
,
and
hauling
her
into
a
dwelling-house
,
would
have
*NL*
been
under
any
circumstances
,
sufficient
temptation
to
all
true
English
*NL*
stragglers
so
blest
as
to
witness
it
,
to
force
a
way
into
that
*NL*
dwelling-house
and
see
the
matter
out
.
But
when
the
phenomenon
was
*NL*
enhanced
by
the
notoriety
and
mystery
by
this
time
associated
all
over
*NL*
the
town
with
the
Bank
robbery
,
it
would
have
lured
the
stragglers
in
,
*NL*
with
an
irresistible
attraction
,
though
the
roof
had
been
expected
to
*NL*
fall
upon
their
heads
.
Accordingly
,
the
chance
witnesses
on
the
ground
,
*NL*
consisting
of
the
busiest
of
the
neighbours
to
the
number
of
some
*NL*
five-and-twenty
,
closed
in
after
Sissy
and
Rachael
,
as
they
closed
in
*NL*
after
Mrs.
Sparsit
and
her
prize
;
and
the
whole
body
made
a
disorderly
*NL*
irruption
into
Mr.
Bounderby
's
dining-room
,
where
the
people
behind
lost
*NL*
not
a
moment
's
time
in
mounting
on
the
chairs
,
to
get
the
better
of
the
*NL*
people
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fetch
Mr.
Bounderby
down
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
Rachael
,
young
woman
;
*NL*
you
know
who
this
is
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
Mrs.
Pegler
,
'
said
Rachael
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
think
it
is
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
exulting
.
`
Fetch
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
.
Stand
away
,
everybody
!
'
Here
old
Mrs.
Pegler
,
muffling
*NL*
herself
up
,
and
shrinking
from
observation
,
whispered
a
word
of
entreaty
.
*NL*
`
Do
n't
tell
me
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
aloud
.
'
I
have
told
you
twenty
*NL*
times
,
coming
along
,
that
I
will
_
not
_
leave
you
till
I
have
handed
you
*NL*
over
to
him
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
now
appeared
,
accompanied
by
Mr.
Gradgrind
and
the
whelp
,
*NL*
with
whom
he
had
been
holding
conference
up-stairs
.
Mr.
Bounderby
looked
*NL*
more
astonished
than
hospitable
,
at
sight
of
this
uninvited
party
in
his
*NL*
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
now
!
'
said
he
.
`
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
ma'am
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
explained
that
worthy
woman
,
'
I
trust
it
is
my
good
fortune
to
*NL*
produce
a
person
you
have
much
desired
to
find
.
Stimulated
by
my
wish
to
*NL*
relieve
your
mind
,
sir
,
and
connecting
together
such
imperfect
clues
to
*NL*
the
part
of
the
country
in
which
that
person
might
be
supposed
to
reside
,
*NL*
as
have
been
afforded
by
the
young
woman
,
Rachael
,
fortunately
now
*NL*
present
to
identify
,
I
have
had
the
happiness
to
succeed
,
and
to
bring
*NL*
that
person
with
me
--
I
need
not
say
most
unwillingly
on
her
part
.
It
has
*NL*
not
been
,
sir
,
without
some
trouble
that
I
have
effected
this
;
but
*NL*
trouble
in
your
service
is
to
me
a
pleasure
,
and
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
cold
*NL*
a
real
gratification
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mrs.
Sparsit
ceased
;
for
Mr.
Bounderby
's
visage
exhibited
an
*NL*
extraordinary
combination
of
all
possible
colours
and
expressions
of
*NL*
discomfiture
,
as
old
Mrs.
Pegler
was
disclosed
to
his
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
do
you
mean
by
this
?
'
was
his
highly
unexpected
demand
,
in
*NL*
great
warmth
.
'
I
ask
you
,
what
do
you
mean
by
this
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
*NL*
ma'am
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
!
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
do
n't
you
mind
your
own
business
,
ma'am
?
'
roared
Bounderby
.
`
How
*NL*
dare
you
go
and
poke
your
officious
nose
into
my
family
affairs
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
allusion
to
her
favourite
feature
overpowered
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
She
sat
*NL*
down
stiffly
in
a
chair
,
as
if
she
were
frozen
;
and
with
a
fixed
stare
at
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
slowly
grated
her
mittens
against
one
another
,
as
if
they
*NL*
were
frozen
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Josiah
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Pegler
,
trembling
.
`
My
darling
boy
!
I
am
*NL*
not
to
blame
.
It
's
not
my
fault
,
Josiah
.
I
told
this
lady
over
and
over
*NL*
again
,
that
I
knew
she
was
doing
what
would
not
be
agreeable
to
you
,
but
*NL*
she
would
do
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
did
you
let
her
bring
you
for
?
Could
n't
you
knock
her
cap
off
,
or
*NL*
her
tooth
out
,
or
scratch
her
,
or
do
something
or
other
to
her
?
'
asked
*NL*
Bounderby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
own
boy
!
She
threatened
me
that
if
I
resisted
her
,
I
should
be
*NL*
brought
by
constables
,
and
it
was
better
to
come
quietly
than
make
that
*NL*
stir
in
such
a
'
--
Mrs.
Pegler
glanced
timidly
but
proudly
round
the
*NL*
walls
--
`
such
a
fine
house
as
this
.
Indeed
,
indeed
,
it
is
not
my
fault
!
*NL*
My
dear
,
noble
,
stately
boy
!
I
have
always
lived
quiet
,
and
secret
,
*NL*
Josiah
,
my
dear
.
I
have
never
broken
the
condition
once
.
I
have
never
*NL*
said
I
was
your
mother
.
I
have
admired
you
at
a
distance
;
and
if
I
have
*NL*
come
to
town
sometimes
,
with
long
times
between
,
to
take
a
proud
peep
at
*NL*
you
,
I
have
done
it
unbeknown
,
my
love
,
and
gone
away
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
walked
in
impatient
*NL*
mortification
up
and
down
at
the
side
of
the
long
dining-table
,
while
the
*NL*
spectators
greedily
took
in
every
syllable
of
Mrs.
Pegler
's
appeal
,
and
*NL*
at
each
succeeding
syllable
became
more
and
more
round-eyed
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
still
walking
up
and
down
when
Mrs.
Pegler
had
done
,
Mr.
*NL*
Gradgrind
addressed
that
maligned
old
lady
:
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
surprised
,
madam
,
'
he
observed
with
severity
,
`
that
in
your
old
age
*NL*
you
have
the
face
to
claim
Mr.
Bounderby
for
your
son
,
after
your
*NL*
unnatural
and
inhuman
treatment
of
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Me
_
unnatural
!
'
cried
poor
old
Mrs.
Pegler
.
'
_
Me
_
inhuman
!
To
my
dear
*NL*
boy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
!
'
repeated
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
Yes
;
dear
in
his
self-made
prosperity
,
*NL*
madam
,
I
dare
say
.
Not
very
dear
,
however
,
when
you
deserted
him
in
his
*NL*
infancy
,
and
left
him
to
the
brutality
of
a
drunken
grandmother
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
deserted
my
Josiah
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Pegler
,
clasping
her
hands
.
`
Now
,
*NL*
Lord
forgive
you
,
sir
,
for
your
wicked
imaginations
,
and
for
your
scandal
*NL*
against
the
memory
of
my
poor
mother
,
who
died
in
my
arms
before
Josiah
*NL*
was
born
.
May
you
repent
of
it
,
sir
,
and
live
to
know
better
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
very
earnest
and
injured
,
that
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
shocked
by
the
*NL*
possibility
which
dawned
upon
him
,
said
in
a
gentler
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
deny
,
then
,
madam
,
that
you
left
your
son
to

to
be
brought
up
in
*NL*
the
gutter
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Josiah
in
the
gutter
!
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Pegler
.
`
No
such
a
thing
,
sir
.
*NL*
Never
!
For
shame
on
you
!
My
dear
boy
knows
,
and
will
give
_
you
_
to
*NL*
know
,
that
though
he
come
of
humble
parents
,
he
come
of
parents
that
*NL*
loved
him
as
dear
as
the
best
could
,
and
never
thought
it
hardship
on
*NL*
themselves
to
pinch
a
bit
that
he
might
write
and
cipher
beautiful
,
and
*NL*
I
've
his
books
at
home
to
show
it
!
Aye
,
have
I
!
'
said
Mrs.
Pegler
,
with
*NL*
indignant
pride
.
`
And
my
dear
boy
knows
,
and
will
give
_
you
_
to
know
,
*NL*
sir
,
that
after
his
beloved
father
died
,
when
he
was
eight
years
old
,
his
*NL*
mother
,
too
,
could
pinch
a
bit
,
as
it
was
her
duty
and
her
pleasure
and
*NL*
her
pride
to
do
it
,
to
help
him
out
in
life
,
and
put
him
`
prentice
.
And
*NL*
a
steady
lad
he
was
,
and
a
kind
master
he
had
to
lend
him
a
hand
,
and
*NL*
well
he
worked
his
own
way
forward
to
be
rich
and
thriving
.
And
_
I
_
'll
*NL*
give
you
to
know
,
sir
--
for
this
my
dear
boy
wo
n't
--
that
though
his
mother
*NL*
kept
but
a
little
village
shop
,
he
never
forgot
her
,
but
pensioned
me
on
*NL*
thirty
pound
a
year
--
more
than
I
want
,
for
I
put
by
out
of
it
--
only
making
*NL*
the
condition
that
I
was
to
keep
down
in
my
own
part
,
and
make
no
boasts
*NL*
about
him

and
not
trouble
him

And
I
never
have
,
except
with
looking
at
*NL*
him
once
a
year
,
when
he
has
never
knowed
it

And
it
's
right

said
poor
*NL*
old
Mrs.
Pegler
,
in
affectionate
championship
,
`
that
I
_
should

keep
down
*NL*
in

I
have
no
doubts
that
if
I
was
here
I
should
do
a
*NL*
many
unbefitting
things

I
am
well
contented

and
I
can
keep
my
pride
*NL*
in
my
Josiah
to
myself

I
can
love
for
love
's
own
sake

And
I
am
*NL*
ashamed
of
you
,

said
Mrs.
Pegler
,
lastly
,
`
for
your
slanders
and
*NL*
suspicions

And
I
never
stood
here
before
,
nor
never
wanted
to
stand
*NL*
here
when
my

son
said
no

And
I
should
n't
be
here
now
,
if
it

*NL*
been
for
being
brought
here

And
for
shame
upon
you

Oh

for
shame

to
*NL*
accuse
me
of
being
a
bad
mother
to
my

standing
here

tell
you
so
different

*NL*
The
bystanders
,
on
and
off
the
dining-room
chairs
,
raised
a
murmur
of
*NL*
sympathy
with
Mrs.
Pegler
,
and
Mr.
Gradgrind
felt
himself
innocently
*NL*
placed
in
a
very
distressing
predicament
,
when
Mr.
Bounderby
,
who
had
*NL*
never
ceased
walking
up

down
,
and
had
every
moment
swelled
larger
and
*NL*
larger
,
and
grown
redder
and
redder

stopped
short

*NL*
*NL*
'
I

said
Mr.

,
`
how
I
come

When

whether

so
good
as
to

I

do
it
.
Therefore
*NL*
those
who
expect
any
explanation
whatever
upon
that
branch
of
the
*NL*
subject
,
will
be
disappointed
--
particularly
Tom
Gradgrind
,
and
he
ca
n't
*NL*
know
it
too
soon
.
In
reference
to
the
Bank
robbery
,
there
has
been
a
*NL*
mistake
made
,
concerning
my
mother
.
If
there
had
n't
been
*NL*
over-officiousness
it
would
n't
have
been
made
,
and
I
hate
*NL*
over-officiousness
at
all
times
,
whether
or
no
.
Good
evening
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Mr.
Bounderby
carried
it
off
in
these
terms
,
holding
the
door
*NL*
open
for
the
company
to
depart
,
there
was
a
blustering
sheepishness
upon
*NL*
him
,
at
once
extremely
crestfallen
and
superlatively
absurd
.
Detected
as
*NL*
the
Bully
of
humility
,
who
had
built
his
windy
reputation
upon
lies
,
and
*NL*
in
his
boastfulness
had
put
the
honest
truth
as
far
away
from
him
as
if
*NL*
he
had
advanced
the
mean
claim
-LRB-
there
is
no
meaner
-RRB-
to
tack
himself
on
to
*NL*
a
pedigree
,
he
cut
a
most
ridiculous
figure
.
With
the
people
filing
off
*NL*
at
the
door
he
held
,
who
he
knew
would
carry
what
had
passed
to
the
whole
*NL*
town
,
to
be
given
to
the
four
winds
,
he
could
not
have
looked
a
Bully
*NL*
more
shorn
and
forlorn
,
if
he
had
had
his
ears
cropped
.
Even
that
*NL*
unlucky
female
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
fallen
from
her
pinnacle
of
exultation
into
*NL*
the
Slough
of
Despond
,
was
not
in
so
bad
a
plight
as
that
remarkable
man
*NL*
and
self-made
Humbug
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rachael
and
Sissy
,
leaving
Mrs.
Pegler
to
occupy
a
bed
at
her
son
's
for
*NL*
that
night
,
walked
together
to
the
gate
of
Stone
Lodge
and
there
parted
.
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
joined
them
before
they
had
gone
very
far
,
and
spoke
with
*NL*
much
interest
of
Stephen
Blackpool
;
for
whom
he
thought
this
signal
*NL*
failure
of
the
suspicions
against
Mrs.
Pegler
was
likely
to
work
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
whelp
;
throughout
this
scene
as
on
all
other
late
occasions
,
he
*NL*
had
stuck
close
to
Bounderby
.
He
seemed
to
feel
that
as
long
as
*NL*
Bounderby
could
make
no
discovery
without
his
knowledge
,
he
was
so
far
*NL*
safe
.
He
never
visited
his
sister
,
and
had
only
seen
her
once
since
she
*NL*
went
home
:
that
is
to
say
on
the
night
when
he
still
stuck
close
to
*NL*
Bounderby
,
as
already
related
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
dim
unformed
fear
lingering
about
his
sister
's
mind
,
to
*NL*
which
she
never
gave
utterance
,
which
surrounded
the
graceless
and
*NL*
ungrateful
boy
with
a
dreadful
mystery
.
The
same
dark
possibility
had
*NL*
presented
itself
in
the
same
shapeless
guise
,
this
very
day
,
to
Sissy
,
*NL*
when
Rachael
spoke
of
some
one
who
would
be
confounded
by
Stephen
's
*NL*
return
,
having
put
him
out
of
the
way
.
Louisa
had
never
spoken
of
*NL*
harbouring
any
suspicion
of
her
brother
in
connexion
with
the
robbery
,
*NL*
she
and
Sissy
had
held
no
confidence
on
the
subject
,
save
in
that
one
*NL*
interchange
of
looks
when
the
unconscious
father
rested
his
gray
head
on
*NL*
his
hand
;
but
it
was
understood
between
them
,
and
they
both
knew
it
.
*NL*
This
other
fear
was
so
awful
,
that
it
hovered
about
each
of
them
like
a
*NL*
ghostly
shadow
;
neither
daring
to
think
of
its
being
near
herself
,
far
*NL*
less
of
its
being
near
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
still
the
forced
spirit
which
the
whelp
had
plucked
up
,
throve
with
*NL*
him
.
If
Stephen
Blackpool
was
not
the
thief
,
let
him
show
himself
.
Why
*NL*
did
n't
he
?
*NL*
*NL*
Another
night
.
Another
day
and
night
.
No
Stephen
Blackpool
.
Where
was
*NL*
the
man
,
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
?

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
THE
STARLIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
Sunday
was
a
bright
Sunday
in
autumn
,
clear
and
cool
,
when
early
in
*NL*
the
morning
Sissy
and
Rachael
met
,
to
walk
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Coketown
cast
ashes
not
only
on
its
own
head
but
on
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
's
too
--
after
the
manner
of
those
pious
persons
who
do
*NL*
penance
for
their
own
sins
by
putting
other
people
into
sackcloth
--
it
was
*NL*
customary
for
those
who
now
and
then
thirsted
for
a
draught
of
pure
air
,
*NL*
which
is
not
absolutely
the
most
wicked
among
the
vanities
of
life
,
to
*NL*
get
a
few
miles
away
by
the
railroad
,
and
then
begin
their
walk
,
or
their
*NL*
lounge
in
the
fields
.
Sissy
and
Rachael
helped
themselves
out
of
the
*NL*
smoke
by
the
usual
means
,
and
were
put
down
at
a
station
about
midway
*NL*
between
the
town
and
Mr.
Bounderby
's
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
green
landscape
was
blotted
here
and
there
with
heaps
of
coal
,
*NL*
it
was
green
elsewhere
,
and
there
were
trees
to
see
,
and
there
were
larks
*NL*
singing
-LRB-
though
it
was
Sunday
-RRB-
,
and
there
were
pleasant
scents
in
the
*NL*
air
,
and
all
was
over-arched
by
a
bright
blue
sky
.
In
the
distance
one
*NL*
way
,
Coketown
showed
as
a
black
mist
;
in
another
distance
hills
began
to
*NL*
rise
;
in
a
third
,
there
was
a
faint
change
in
the
light
of
the
horizon
*NL*
where
it
shone
upon
the
far-off
sea
.
Under
their
feet
,
the
grass
was
*NL*
fresh
;
beautiful
shadows
of
branches
flickered
upon
it
,
and
speckled
it
;
*NL*
hedgerows
were
luxuriant
;
everything
was
at
peace
.
Engines
at
pits
'
*NL*
mouths
,
and
lean
old
horses
that
had
worn
the
circle
of
their
daily
*NL*
labour
into
the
ground
,
were
alike
quiet
;
wheels
had
ceased
for
a
short
*NL*
space
to
turn
;
and
the
great
wheel
of
earth
seemed
to
revolve
without
the
*NL*
shocks
and
noises
of
another
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
across
the
fields
and
down
the
shady
lanes
,
sometimes
*NL*
getting
over
a
fragment
of
a
fence
so
rotten
that
it
dropped
at
a
touch
*NL*
of
the
foot
,
sometimes
passing
near
a
wreck
of
bricks
and
beams
overgrown
*NL*
with
grass
,
marking
the
site
of
deserted
works
.
They
followed
paths
and
*NL*
tracks
,
however
slight
.
Mounds
where
the
grass
was
rank
and
high
,
and
*NL*
where
brambles
,
dock-weed
,
and
such-like
vegetation
,
were
confusedly
*NL*
heaped
together
,
they
always
avoided
;
for
dismal
stories
were
told
in
*NL*
that
country
of
the
old
pits
hidden
beneath
such
indications
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
high
when
they
sat
down
to
rest
.
They
had
seen
no
one
,
near
*NL*
or
distant
,
for
a
long
time
;
and
the
solitude
remained
unbroken
.
`
It
is
*NL*
so
still
here
,
Rachael
,
and
the
way
is
so
untrodden
,
that
I
think
we
must
*NL*
be
the
first
who
have
been
here
all
the
summer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
Sissy
said
it
,
her
eyes
were
attracted
by
another
of
those
rotten
*NL*
fragments
of
fence
upon
the
ground
.
She
got
up
to
look
at
it
.
`
And
yet
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
.
This
has
not
been
broken
very
long
.
The
wood
is
quite
*NL*
fresh
where
it
gave
way
.
Here
are
footsteps
too
.
--
O
Rachael
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
back
,
and
caught
her
round
the
neck
.
Rachael
had
already
started
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
the
matter
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
.
There
is
a
hat
lying
in
the
grass
.
'
They
went
forward
*NL*
together
.
Rachael
took
it
up
,
shaking
from
head
to
foot
.
She
broke
into
*NL*
a
passion
of
tears
and
lamentations
:
Stephen
Blackpool
was
written
in
his
*NL*
own
hand
on
the
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
the
poor
lad
,
the
poor
lad
!
He
has
been
made
away
with
.
He
is
lying
*NL*
murdered
here
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
there
--
has
the
hat
any
blood
upon
it
?
'
Sissy
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
afraid
to
look
;
but
they
did
examine
it
,
and
found
no
mark
of
*NL*
violence
,
inside
or
out
.
It
had
been
lying
there
some
days
,
for
rain
and
*NL*
dew
had
stained
it
,
and
the
mark
of
its
shape
was
on
the
grass
where
it
*NL*
had
fallen
.
They
looked
fearfully
about
them
,
without
moving
,
but
could
*NL*
see
nothing
more
.
`
Rachael
,
'
Sissy
whispered
,
'
I
will
go
on
a
little
by
*NL*
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
unclasped
her
hand
,
and
was
in
the
act
of
stepping
forward
,
when
*NL*
Rachael
caught
her
in
both
arms
with
a
scream
that
resounded
over
the
*NL*
wide
landscape
.
Before
them
,
at
their
very
feet
,
was
the
brink
of
a
*NL*
black
ragged
chasm
hidden
by
the
thick
grass
.
They
sprang
back
,
and
fell
*NL*
upon
their
knees
,
each
hiding
her
face
upon
the
other
's
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
O
,
my
good
Lord
!
He
's
down
there
!
Down
there
!
'
At
first
this
,
and
her
*NL*
terrific
screams
,
were
all
that
could
be
got
from
Rachael
,
by
any
tears
,
*NL*
by
any
prayers
,
by
any
representations
,
by
any
means
.
It
was
impossible
*NL*
to
hush
her
;
and
it
was
deadly
necessary
to
hold
her
,
or
she
would
have
*NL*
flung
herself
down
the
shaft
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rachael
,
dear
Rachael
,
good
Rachael
,
for
the
love
of
Heaven
,
not
these
*NL*
dreadful
cries
!
Think
of
Stephen
,
think
of
Stephen
,
think
of
Stephen
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
By
an
earnest
repetition
of
this
entreaty
,
poured
out
in
all
the
agony
of
*NL*
such
a
moment
,
Sissy
at
last
brought
her
to
be
silent
,
and
to
look
at
her
*NL*
with
a
tearless
face
of
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rachael
,
Stephen
may
be
living
.
You
would
n't
leave
him
lying
maimed
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
this
dreadful
place
,
a
moment
,
if
you
could
bring
help
to
*NL*
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
no
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
stir
from
here
,
for
his
sake
!
Let
me
go
and
listen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
shuddered
to
approach
the
pit
;
but
she
crept
towards
it
on
her
hands
*NL*
and
knees
,
and
called
to
him
as
loud
as
she
could
call
.
She
listened
,
*NL*
but
no
sound
replied
.
She
called
again
and
listened
;
still
no
answering
*NL*
sound
.
She
did
this
,
twenty
,
thirty
times
.
She
took
a
little
clod
of
*NL*
earth
from
the
broken
ground
where
he
had
stumbled
,
and
threw
it
in
.
She
*NL*
could
not
hear
it
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wide
prospect
,
so
beautiful
in
its
stillness
but
a
few
minutes
ago
,
*NL*
almost
carried
despair
to
her
brave
heart
,
as
she
rose
and
looked
all
*NL*
round
her
,
seeing
no
help
.
`
Rachael
,
we
must
lose
not
a
moment
.
We
must
*NL*
go
in
different
directions
,
seeking
aid
.
You
shall
go
by
the
way
we
have
*NL*
come
,
and
I
will
go
forward
by
the
path
.
Tell
any
one
you
see
,
and
every
*NL*
one
what
has
happened
.
Think
of
Stephen
,
think
of
Stephen
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
by
Rachael
's
face
that
she
might
trust
her
now
.
And
after
*NL*
standing
for
a
moment
to
see
her
running
,
wringing
her
hands
as
she
ran
,
*NL*
she
turned
and
went
upon
her
own
search
;
she
stopped
at
the
hedge
to
tie
*NL*
her
shawl
there
as
a
guide
to
the
place
,
then
threw
her
bonnet
aside
,
and
*NL*
ran
as
she
had
never
run
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Run
,
Sissy
,
run
,
in
Heaven
's
name
!
Do
n't
stop
for
breath
.
Run
,
run
!
*NL*
Quickening
herself
by
carrying
such
entreaties
in
her
thoughts
,
she
ran
*NL*
from
field
to
field
,
and
lane
to
lane
,
and
place
to
place
,
as
she
had
*NL*
never
run
before
;
until
she
came
to
a
shed
by
an
engine-house
,
where
two
*NL*
men
lay
in
the
shade
,
asleep
on
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
to
wake
them
,
and
next
to
tell
them
,
all
so
wild
and
breathless
as
*NL*
she
was
,
what
had
brought
her
there
,
were
difficulties
;
but
they
no
*NL*
sooner
understood
her
than
their
spirits
were
on
fire
like
hers
.
One
of
*NL*
the
men
was
in
a
drunken
slumber
,
but
on
his
comrade
's
shouting
to
him
*NL*
that
a
man
had
fallen
down
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
,
he
started
out
to
a
pool
*NL*
of
dirty
water
,
put
his
head
in
it
,
and
came
back
sober
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
two
men
she
ran
to
another
half-a-mile
further
,
and
with
that
*NL*
one
to
another
,
while
they
ran
elsewhere
.
Then
a
horse
was
found
;
and
*NL*
she
got
another
man
to
ride
for
life
or
death
to
the
railroad
,
and
send
a
*NL*
message
to
Louisa
,
which
she
wrote
and
gave
him
.
By
this
time
a
whole
*NL*
village
was
up
:
and
windlasses
,
ropes
,
poles
,
candles
,
lanterns
,
all
*NL*
things
necessary
,
were
fast
collecting
and
being
brought
into
one
place
,
*NL*
to
be
carried
to
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
now
hours
and
hours
since
she
had
left
the
lost
man
lying
in
*NL*
the
grave
where
he
had
been
buried
alive
.
She
could
not
bear
to
remain
*NL*
away
from
it
any
longer
--
it
was
like
deserting
him
--
and
she
hurried
swiftly
*NL*
back
,
accompanied
by
half-a-dozen
labourers
,
including
the
drunken
man
*NL*
whom
the
news
had
sobered
,
and
who
was
the
best
man
of
all
.
When
they
*NL*
came
to
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
,
they
found
it
as
lonely
as
she
had
left
it
.
*NL*
The
men
called
and
listened
as
she
had
done
,
and
examined
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
chasm
,
and
settled
how
it
had
happened
,
and
then
sat
down
to
wait
until
*NL*
the
implements
they
wanted
should
come
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
sound
of
insects
in
the
air
,
every
stirring
of
the
leaves
,
every
*NL*
whisper
among
these
men
,
made
Sissy
tremble
,
for
she
thought
it
was
a
cry
*NL*
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
.
But
the
wind
blew
idly
over
it
,
and
no
sound
*NL*
arose
to
the
surface
,
and
they
sat
upon
the
grass
,
waiting
and
waiting
.
*NL*
After
they
had
waited
some
time
,
straggling
people
who
had
heard
of
the
*NL*
accident
began
to
come
up
;
then
the
real
help
of
implements
began
to
*NL*
arrive
.
In
the
midst
of
this
,
Rachael
returned
;
and
with
her
party
there
*NL*
was
a
surgeon
,
who
brought
some
wine
and
medicines
.
But
,
the
expectation
*NL*
among
the
people
that
the
man
would
be
found
alive
was
very
slight
*NL*
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
being
now
people
enough
present
to
impede
the
work
,
the
sobered
man
*NL*
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
rest
,
or
was
put
there
by
the
general
*NL*
consent
,
and
made
a
large
ring
round
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
,
and
appointed
*NL*
men
to
keep
it
.
Besides
such
volunteers
as
were
accepted
to
work
,
only
*NL*
Sissy
and
Rachael
were
at
first
permitted
within
this
ring
;
but
,
later
in
*NL*
the
day
,
when
the
message
brought
an
express
from
Coketown
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
*NL*
and
Louisa
,
and
Mr.
Bounderby
,
and
the
whelp
,
were
also
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
four
hours
lower
than
when
Sissy
and
Rachael
had
first
sat
*NL*
down
upon
the
grass
,
before
a
means
of
enabling
two
men
to
descend
*NL*
securely
was
rigged
with
poles
and
ropes
.
Difficulties
had
arisen
in
the
*NL*
construction
of
this
machine
,
simple
as
it
was
;
requisites
had
been
found
*NL*
wanting
,
and
messages
had
had
to
go
and
return
.
It
was
five
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
of
the
bright
autumnal
Sunday
,
before
a
candle
was
sent
*NL*
down
to
try
the
air
,
while
three
or
four
rough
faces
stood
crowded
close
*NL*
together
,
attentively
watching
it
:
the
man
at
the
windlass
lowering
as
*NL*
they
were
told
.
The
candle
was
brought
up
again
,
feebly
burning
,
and
*NL*
then
some
water
was
cast
in
.
Then
the
bucket
was
hooked
on
;
and
the
*NL*
sobered
man
and
another
got
in
with
lights
,
giving
the
word
`
Lower
away
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
rope
went
out
,
tight
and
strained
,
and
the
windlass
creaked
,
there
*NL*
was
not
a
breath
among
the
one
or
two
hundred
men
and
women
looking
on
,
*NL*
that
came
as
it
was
wont
to
come
.
The
signal
was
given
and
the
windlass
*NL*
stopped
,
with
abundant
rope
to
spare
.
Apparently
so
long
an
interval
*NL*
ensued
with
the
men
at
the
windlass
standing
idle
,
that
some
women
*NL*
shrieked
that
another
accident
had
happened
!
But
the
surgeon
who
held
*NL*
the
watch
,
declared
five
minutes
not
to
have
elapsed
yet
,
and
sternly
*NL*
admonished
them
to
keep
silence
.
He
had
not
well
done
speaking
,
when
the
*NL*
windlass
was
reversed
and
worked
again
.
Practised
eyes
knew
that
it
did
*NL*
not
go
as
heavily
as
it
would
if
both
workmen
had
been
coming
up
,
and
*NL*
that
only
one
was
returning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rope
came
in
tight
and
strained
;
and
ring
after
ring
was
coiled
upon
*NL*
the
barrel
of
the
windlass
,
and
all
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
pit
.
The
*NL*
sobered
man
was
brought
up
and
leaped
out
briskly
on
the
grass
.
There
*NL*
was
an
universal
cry
of
`
Alive
or
dead
?
'
and
then
a
deep
,
profound
hush
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
said
`
Alive
!
'
a
great
shout
arose
and
many
eyes
had
tears
in
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
he
's
hurt
very
bad
,
'
he
added
,
as
soon
as
he
could
make
himself
*NL*
heard
again
.
`
Where
's
doctor
?
He
's
hurt
so
very
bad
,
sir
,
that
we
donno
*NL*
how
to
get
him
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
consulted
together
,
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
surgeon
,
as
he
*NL*
asked
some
questions
,
and
shook
his
head
on
receiving
the
replies
.
The
*NL*
sun
was
setting
now
;
and
the
red
light
in
the
evening
sky
touched
every
*NL*
face
there
,
and
caused
it
to
be
distinctly
seen
in
all
its
rapt
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
consultation
ended
in
the
men
returning
to
the
windlass
,
and
the
*NL*
pitman
going
down
again
,
carrying
the
wine
and
some
other
small
matters
*NL*
with
him
.
Then
the
other
man
came
up
.
In
the
meantime
,
under
the
*NL*
surgeon
's
directions
,
some
men
brought
a
hurdle
,
on
which
others
made
a
*NL*
thick
bed
of
spare
clothes
covered
with
loose
straw
,
while
he
himself
*NL*
contrived
some
bandages
and
slings
from
shawls
and
handkerchiefs
.
As
*NL*
these
were
made
,
they
were
hung
upon
an
arm
of
the
pitman
who
had
last
*NL*
come
up
,
with
instructions
how
to
use
them
:
and
as
he
stood
,
shown
by
the
*NL*
light
he
carried
,
leaning
his
powerful
loose
hand
upon
one
of
the
poles
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
glancing
down
the
pit
,
and
sometimes
glancing
round
upon
*NL*
the
people
,
he
was
not
the
least
conspicuous
figure
in
the
scene
.
It
was
*NL*
dark
now
,
and
torches
were
kindled
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
from
the
little
this
man
said
to
those
about
him
,
which
was
*NL*
quickly
repeated
all
over
the
circle
,
that
the
lost
man
had
fallen
upon
a
*NL*
mass
of
crumbled
rubbish
with
which
the
pit
was
half
choked
up
,
and
that
*NL*
his
fall
had
been
further
broken
by
some
jagged
earth
at
the
side
.
He
*NL*
lay
upon
his
back
with
one
arm
doubled
under
him
,
and
according
to
his
*NL*
own
belief
had
hardly
stirred
since
he
fell
,
except
that
he
had
moved
his
*NL*
free
hand
to
a
side
pocket
,
in
which
he
remembered
to
have
some
bread
and
*NL*
meat
-LRB-
of
which
he
had
swallowed
crumbs
-RRB-
,
and
had
likewise
scooped
up
a
*NL*
little
water
in
it
now
and
then
.
He
had
come
straight
away
from
his
*NL*
work
,
on
being
written
to
,
and
had
walked
the
whole
journey
;
and
was
on
*NL*
his
way
to
Mr.
Bounderby
's
country
house
after
dark
,
when
he
fell
.
He
*NL*
was
crossing
that
dangerous
country
at
such
a
dangerous
time
,
because
he
*NL*
was
innocent
of
what
was
laid
to
his
charge
,
and
could
n't
rest
from
*NL*
coming
the
nearest
way
to
deliver
himself
up
.
The
Old
Hell
Shaft
,
the
*NL*
pitman
said
,
with
a
curse
upon
it
,
was
worthy
of
its
bad
name
to
the
*NL*
last
;
for
though
Stephen
could
speak
now
,
he
believed
it
would
soon
be
*NL*
found
to
have
mangled
the
life
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
all
was
ready
,
this
man
,
still
taking
his
last
hurried
charges
from
*NL*
his
comrades
and
the
surgeon
after
the
windlass
had
begun
to
lower
him
,
*NL*
disappeared
into
the
pit
.
The
rope
went
out
as
before
,
the
signal
was
*NL*
made
as
before
,
and
the
windlass
stopped
.
No
man
removed
his
hand
from
*NL*
it
now
.
Every
one
waited
with
his
grasp
set
,
and
his
body
bent
down
to
*NL*
the
work
,
ready
to
reverse
and
wind
in
.
At
length
the
signal
was
given
,
*NL*
and
all
the
ring
leaned
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
now
,
the
rope
came
in
,
tightened
and
strained
to
its
utmost
as
it
*NL*
appeared
,
and
the
men
turned
heavily
,
and
the
windlass
complained
.
It
*NL*
was
scarcely
endurable
to
look
at
the
rope
,
and
think
of
its
giving
way
.
*NL*
But
,
ring
after
ring
was
coiled
upon
the
barrel
of
the
windlass
safely
,
*NL*
and
the
connecting
chains
appeared
,
and
finally
the
bucket
with
the
two
*NL*
men
holding
on
at
the
sides
--
a
sight
to
make
the
head
swim
,
and
oppress
*NL*
the
heart
--
and
tenderly
supporting
between
them
,
slung
and
tied
within
,
*NL*
the
figure
of
a
poor
,
crushed
,
human
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
low
murmur
of
pity
went
round
the
throng
,
and
the
women
wept
aloud
,
as
*NL*
this
form
,
almost
without
form
,
was
moved
very
slowly
from
its
iron
*NL*
deliverance
,
and
laid
upon
the
bed
of
straw
.
At
first
,
none
but
the
*NL*
surgeon
went
close
to
it
.
He
did
what
he
could
in
its
adjustment
on
the
*NL*
couch
,
but
the
best
that
he
could
do
was
to
cover
it
.
That
gently
done
,
*NL*
he
called
to
him
Rachael
and
Sissy
.
And
at
that
time
the
pale
,
worn
,
*NL*
patient
face
was
seen
looking
up
at
the
sky
,
with
the
broken
right
hand
*NL*
lying
bare
on
the
outside
of
the
covering
garments
,
as
if
waiting
to
be
*NL*
taken
by
another
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
gave
him
drink
,
moistened
his
face
with
water
,
and
administered
some
*NL*
drops
of
cordial
and
wine
.
Though
he
lay
quite
motionless
looking
up
at
*NL*
the
sky
,
he
smiled
and
said
,
`
Rachael
.
'
She
stooped
down
on
the
grass
at
*NL*
his
side
,
and
bent
over
him
until
her
eyes
were
between
his
and
the
sky
,
*NL*
for
he
could
not
so
much
as
turn
them
to
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rachael
,
my
dear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
his
hand
.
He
smiled
again
and
said
,
`
Do
n't
let
'
t
go
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thou
`
rt
in
great
pain
,
my
own
dear
Stephen
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ha
'
been
,
but
not
now
.
I
ha
'
been
--
dreadful
,
and
dree
,
and
long

my
*NL*
dear

but
't
is

Ah

Rachael
,
aw

*NL*
*NL*
The
spectre
of
his
old
look
seemed
to
pass
as
he
said
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ha
'
fell
into

pit

not

to
spare
'em
for

and
children
that
they
loves
as
well
*NL*
as

loves
theirs
.
When

in
work
,
it
killed
wi'out
need
;
*NL*
when
't
is

alone
,
it
kills
wi'out

See
how

one
way

in

*NL*
*NL*
He
faintly
said
it
,
without
any
anger
against
any
one
.
Merely
as
the
*NL*
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thy

Louisa
approached
him
;
but
he
could
not
see
her
,
lying
with
his
face
*NL*
turned
up
to
the

sky

*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
hearing
what
he
said
,
bent
over
him
on
the
opposite
side
to
*NL*
Rachael
,
so
that
he
could
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
ha
'
heard
?
'
he
said
,
after
a
few
moments
'
silence
.
'
I
ha
'
not
*NL*

,
ledy
.

*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes

*NL*

You

*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
here
,
'
said
Louisa
,
with
dread
.
`
Shall
I
bring
him
to
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
yo
please
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
returned
with
her
father
.
Standing
hand-in-hand
,
they
both
looked
*NL*
down
upon
the
solemn
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
yo
will
clear
me
an
'
mak
my
name
good
wi
'
aw
men
.
This
I
leave
to
*NL*
yo
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
was
troubled
and
asked
how
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
was
the
reply
:
`
yor
son
will
tell
yo
how
.
Ask
him
.
I
mak
no
*NL*
charges
:
I
leave
none
ahint

:
not
a
single
word
.
I
ha
'
seen
an
'
spok
'n
*NL*
wi
'
yor

,
one
night
.
I
ask
no
more
o
'
yo
than
that
yo
clear

--
an
'
I
*NL*
trust
to
yo
to

`
t.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
bearers
being
now
ready
to
carry
him
away
,
and
the
surgeon
being
*NL*
anxious
for
his
removal
,
those
who
had
torches
or
lanterns
,
prepared
to
*NL*
go
in
front
of
the
litter
.
Before
it
was
raised
,
and
while
they
were
*NL*
arranging
how
to
go
,
he
said
to
Rachael
,
looking
upward
at
the
star
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Often
as
I
coom
to
myseln
,
and
found
it
shinin
'
on
me
down
there
in
my
*NL*
trouble
,
I
thowt
it
were
the
star
as
guided
to
Our
Saviour
's
home
.
I
*NL*
awmust
think
it
be
the
very
star
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
lifted
him
up
,
and
he
was
overjoyed
to
find
that
they
were
about
to
*NL*
take
him
in
the
direction
whither
the
star
seemed
to
him
to
lead
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rachael
,
beloved
lass
!
Do
n't
let
go
my
hand
.
We
may
walk
toogether
*NL*
t
`
night
,
my
dear
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
hold
thy
hand
,
and
keep
beside
thee
,
Stephen
,
all
the
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bless
thee
!
Will
soombody
be
pleased
to
coover
my
face
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
carried
him
very
gently
along
the
fields
,
and
down
the
lanes
,
and
*NL*
over
the
wide
landscape
;
Rachael
always
holding
the
hand
in
hers
.
Very
*NL*
few
whispers
broke
the
mournful
silence
.
It
was
soon
a
funeral
*NL*
procession
.
The
star
had
shown
him
where
to
find
the
God
of
the
poor
;
*NL*
and
through
humility
,
and
sorrow
,
and
forgiveness
,
he
had
gone
to
his
*NL*
Redeemer
's
rest
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
WHELP-HUNTING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BEFORE
the
ring
formed
round
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
was
broken
,
one
figure
*NL*
had
disappeared
from
within
it
.
Mr.
Bounderby
and
his
shadow
had
not
*NL*
stood
near
Louisa
,
who
held
her
father
's
arm
,
but
in
a
retired
place
by
*NL*
themselves
.
When
Mr.
Gradgrind
was
summoned
to
the
couch
,
Sissy
,
*NL*
attentive
to
all
that
happened
,
slipped
behind
that
wicked
shadow
--
a
sight
*NL*
in
the
horror
of
his
face
,
if
there
had
been
eyes
there
for
any
sight
but
*NL*
one
--
and
whispered
in
his
ear
.
Without
turning
his
head
,
he
conferred
*NL*
with
her
a
few
moments
,
and
vanished
.
Thus
the
whelp
had
gone
out
of
the
*NL*
circle
before
the
people
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
father
reached
home
,
he
sent
a
message
to
Mr.
Bounderby
's
,
*NL*
desiring
his
son
to
come
to
him
directly
.
The
reply
was
,
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
having
missed
him
in
the
crowd
,
and
seeing
nothing
of
him
*NL*
since
,
had
supposed
him
to
be
at
Stone
Lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
believe
,
father
,
'
said
Louisa
,
`
he
will
not
come
back
to
town
*NL*
to-night
.
'
Mr.
Gradgrind
turned
away
,
and
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
he
went
down
to
the
Bank
himself
as
soon
as
it
was
*NL*
opened
,
and
seeing
his
son
's
place
empty
-LRB-
he
had
not
the
courage
to
look
*NL*
in
at
first
-RRB-
went
back
along
the
street
to
meet
Mr.
Bounderby
on
his
way
*NL*
there
.
To
whom
he
said
that
,
for
reasons
he
would
soon
explain
,
but
*NL*
entreated
not
then
to
be
asked
for
,
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
employ
*NL*
his
son
at
a
distance
for
a
little
while
.
Also
,
that
he
was
charged
with
*NL*
the
duty
of
vindicating
Stephen
Blackpool
's
memory
,
and
declaring
the
*NL*
thief
.
Mr.
Bounderby
quite
confounded
,
stood
stock-still
in
the
street
*NL*
after
his
father-in-law
had
left
him
,
swelling
like
an
immense
*NL*
soap-bubble
,
without
its
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
went
home
,
locked
himself
in
his
room
,
and
kept
it
all
that
*NL*
day
.
When
Sissy
and
Louisa
tapped
at
his
door
,
he
said
,
without
opening
*NL*
it
,
`
Not
now
,
my
dears
;
in
the
evening
.
'
On
their
return
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
he
said
,
'
I
am
not
able
yet
--
to-morrow
.
'
He
ate
nothing
all
day
,
and
had
*NL*
no
candle
after
dark
;
and
they
heard
him
walking
to
and
fro
late
at
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
the
morning
he
appeared
at
breakfast
at
the
usual
hour
,
and
took
*NL*
his
usual
place
at
the
table
.
Aged
and
bent
he
looked
,
and
quite
bowed
*NL*
down
;
and
yet
he
looked
a
wiser
man
,
and
a
better
man
,
than
in
the
days
*NL*
when
in
this
life
he
wanted
nothing
--
but
Facts
.
Before
he
left
the
room
,
*NL*
he
appointed
a
time
for
them
to
come
to
him
;
and
so
,
with
his
gray
head
*NL*
drooping
,
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
father
,
'
said
Louisa
,
when
they
kept
their
appointment
,
`
you
have
*NL*
three
young
children
left
.
They
will
be
different
,
I
will
be
different
*NL*
yet
,
with
Heaven
's
help
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
her
hand
to
Sissy
,
as
if
she
meant
with
her
help
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
wretched
brother
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
Do
you
think
he
had
*NL*
planned
this
robbery
,
when
he
went
with
you
to
the
lodging
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
fear
so
,
father
.
I
know
he
had
wanted
money
very
much
,
and
had
spent
*NL*
a
great
deal
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
poor
man
being
about
to
leave
the
town
,
it
came
into
his
evil
brain
*NL*
to
cast
suspicion
on
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
it
must
have
flashed
upon
him
while
he
sat
there
,
father
.
For
I
*NL*
asked
him
to
go
there
with
me
.
The
visit
did
not
originate
with
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
some
conversation
with
the
poor
man
.
Did
he
take
him
aside
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
took
him
out
of
the
room
.
I
asked
him
afterwards
,
why
he
had
done
*NL*
so
,
and
he
made
a
plausible
excuse
;
but
since
last
night
,
father
,
and
*NL*
when
I
remember
the
circumstances
by
its
light
,
I
am
afraid
I
can
imagine
*NL*
too
truly
what
passed
between
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
know
,
'
said
her
father
,
`
if
your
thoughts
present
your
guilty
*NL*
brother
in
the
same
dark
view
as
mine
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
fear
,
father
,
'
hesitated
Louisa
,
`
that
he
must
have
made
some
*NL*
representation
to
Stephen
Blackpool
--
perhaps
in
my
name
,
perhaps
in
his
*NL*
own
--
which
induced
him
to
do
in
good
faith
and
honesty
,
what
he
had
never
*NL*
done
before
,
and
to
wait
about
the
Bank
those
two
or
three
nights
before
*NL*
he
left
the
town
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Too
plain
!
'
returned
the
father
.
`
Too
plain
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
shaded
his
face
,
and
remained
silent
for
some
moments
.
Recovering
*NL*
himself
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
now
,
how
is
he
to
be
found
?
How
is
he
to
be
saved
from
justice
?
In
*NL*
the
few
hours
that
I
can
possibly
allow
to
elapse
before
I
publish
the
*NL*
truth
,
how
is
he
to
be
found
by
us
,
and
only
by
us
?
Ten
thousand
pounds
*NL*
could
not
effect
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sissy
has
effected
it
,
father
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
eyes
to
where
she
stood
,
like
a
good
fairy
in
his
house
,
*NL*
and
said
in
a
tone
of
softened
gratitude
and
grateful
kindness
,
`
It
is
*NL*
always
you
,
my
child
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
had
our
fears
,
'
Sissy
explained
,
glancing
at
Louisa
,
`
before
*NL*
yesterday
;
and
when
I
saw
you
brought
to
the
side
of
the
litter
last
*NL*
night
,
and
heard
what
passed
-LRB-
being
close
to
Rachael
all
the
time
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
went
to
him
when
no
one
saw
,
and
said
to
him
,
``
Do
n't
look
at
me
.
See
*NL*
where
your
father
is
.
Escape
at
once
,
for
his
sake
and
your
own
!
''
He
*NL*
was
in
a
tremble
before
I
whispered
to
him
,
and
he
started
and
trembled
*NL*
more
then
,
and
said
,
``
Where
can
I
go
?
I
have
very
little
money
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
who
will
hide
me
!
''
I
thought
of
father
's
old
circus
.
I
have
*NL*
not
forgotten
where
Mr.
Sleary
goes
at
this
time
of
year
,
and
I
read
of
*NL*
him
in
a
paper
only
the
other
day
.
I
told
him
to
hurry
there
,
and
tell
*NL*
his
name
,
and
ask
Mr.
Sleary
to
hide
him
till
I
came
.
``
I
'll
get
to
him
*NL*
before
the
morning
,
''
he
said
.
And
I
saw
him
shrink
away
among
the
*NL*
people
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
Heaven
!
'
exclaimed
his
father
.
`
He
may
be
got
abroad
yet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
more
hopeful
as
the
town
to
which
Sissy
had
directed
him
was
*NL*
within
three
hours
'
journey
of
Liverpool
,
whence
he
could
be
swiftly
*NL*
dispatched
to
any
part
of
the
world
.
But
,
caution
being
necessary
in
*NL*
communicating
with
him
--
for
there
was
a
greater
danger
every
moment
of
his
*NL*
being
suspected
now
,
and
nobody
could
be
sure
at
heart
but
that
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
himself
,
in
a
bullying
vein
of
public
zeal
,
might
play
a
Roman
*NL*
part
--
it
was
consented
that
Sissy
and
Louisa
should
repair
to
the
place
in
*NL*
question
,
by
a
circuitous
course
,
alone
;
and
that
the
unhappy
father
,
*NL*
setting
forth
in
an
opposite
direction
,
should
get
round
to
the
same
*NL*
bourne
by
another
and
wider
route
.
It
was
further
agreed
that
he
should
*NL*
not
present
himself
to
Mr.
Sleary
,
lest
his
intentions
should
be
*NL*
mistrusted
,
or
the
intelligence
of
his
arrival
should
cause
his
son
to
*NL*
take
flight
anew
;
but
,
that
the
communication
should
be
left
to
Sissy
and
*NL*
Louisa
to
open
;
and
that
they
should
inform
the
cause
of
so
much
misery
*NL*
and
disgrace
,
of
his
father
's
being
at
hand
and
of
the
purpose
for
which
*NL*
they
had
come
.
When
these
arrangements
had
been
well
considered
and
were
*NL*
fully
understood
by
all
three
,
it
was
time
to
begin
to
carry
them
into
*NL*
execution
.
Early
in
the
afternoon
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
walked
direct
from
his
*NL*
own
house
into
the
country
,
to
be
taken
up
on
the
line
by
which
he
was
to
*NL*
travel
;
and
at
night
the
remaining
two
set
forth
upon
their
different
*NL*
course
,
encouraged
by
not
seeing
any
face
they
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
travelled
all
night
,
except
when
they
were
left
,
for
odd
numbers
*NL*
of
minutes
,
at
branch-places
,
up
illimitable
flights
of
steps
,
or
down
*NL*
wells
--
which
was
the
only
variety
of
those
branches
--
and
,
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
were
turned
out
on
a
swamp
,
a
mile
or
two
from
the
town
they
*NL*
sought
.
From
this
dismal
spot
they
were
rescued
by
a
savage
old
*NL*
postilion
,
who
happened
to
be
up
early
,
kicking
a
horse
in
a
fly
:
and
so
*NL*
were
smuggled
into
the
town
by
all
the
back
lanes
where
the
pigs
lived
:
*NL*
which
,
although
not
a
magnificent
or
even
savoury
approach
,
was
,
as
is
*NL*
usual
in
such
cases
,
the
legitimate
highway
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
they
saw
on
entering
the
town
was
the
skeleton
of
*NL*
Sleary
's
Circus
.
The
company
had
departed
for
another
town
more
than
*NL*
twenty
miles
off
,
and
had
opened
there
last
night
.
The
connection
*NL*
between
the
two
places
was
by
a
hilly
turnpike-road
,
and
the
travelling
*NL*
on
that
road
was
very
slow
.
Though
they
took
but
a
hasty
breakfast
,
and
*NL*
no
rest
-LRB-
which
it
would
have
been
in
vain
to
seek
under
such
anxious
*NL*
circumstances
-RRB-
,
it
was
noon
before
they
began
to
find
the
bills
of
*NL*
Sleary
's
Horse-riding
on
barns
and
walls
,
and
one
o'clock
when
they
*NL*
stopped
in
the
market-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
Grand
Morning
Performance
by
the
Riders
,
commencing
at
that
very
hour
,
*NL*
was
in
course
of
announcement
by
the
bellman
as
they
set
their
feet
upon
*NL*
the
stones
of
the
street
.
Sissy
recommended
that
,
to
avoid
making
*NL*
inquiries
and
attracting
attention
in
the
town
,
they
should
present
*NL*
themselves
to
pay
at
the
door
.
If
Mr.
Sleary
were
taking
the
money
,
he
*NL*
would
be
sure
to
know
her
,
and
would
proceed
with
discretion
.
If
he
were
*NL*
not
,
he
would
be
sure
to
see
them
inside
;
and
,
knowing
what
he
had
done
*NL*
with
the
fugitive
,
would
proceed
with
discretion
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
they
repaired
,
with
fluttering
hearts
,
to
the
well-remembered
*NL*
booth
.
The
flag
with
the
inscription
SLEARY
'S
HORSE-RIDING
was
there
;
*NL*
and
the
Gothic
niche
was
there
;
but
Mr.
Sleary
was
not
there
.
Master
*NL*
Kidderminster
,
grown
too
maturely
turfy
to
be
received
by
the
wildest
*NL*
credulity
as
Cupid
any
more
,
had
yielded
to
the
invincible
force
of
*NL*
circumstances
-LRB-
and
his
beard
-RRB-
,
and
,
in
the
capacity
of
a
man
who
made
*NL*
himself
generally
useful
,
presided
on
this
occasion
over
the
*NL*
exchequer
--
having
also
a
drum
in
reserve
,
on
which
to
expend
his
leisure
*NL*
moments
and
superfluous
forces
.
In
the
extreme
sharpness
of
his
look
out
*NL*
for
base
coin
,
Mr.
Kidderminster
,
as
at
present
situated
,
never
saw
*NL*
anything
but
money
;
so
Sissy
passed
him
unrecognised
,
and
they
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
of
Japan
,
on
a
steady
old
white
horse
stencilled
with
black
*NL*
spots
,
was
twirling
five
wash-hand
basins
at
once
,
as
it
is
the
favourite
*NL*
recreation
of
that
monarch
to
do
.
Sissy
,
though
well
acquainted
with
his
*NL*
Royal
line
,
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
present
Emperor
,
and
his
*NL*
reign
was
peaceful
.
Miss
Josephine
Sleary
,
in
her
celebrated
graceful
*NL*
Equestrian
Tyrolean
Flower
Act
,
was
then
announced
by
a
new
clown
-LRB-
who
*NL*
humorously
said
Cauliflower
Act
-RRB-
,
and
Mr.
Sleary
appeared
,
leading
her
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sleary
had
only
made
one
cut
at
the
Clown
with
his
long
whip-lash
,
*NL*
and
the
Clown
had
only
said
,
`
If
you
do
it
again
,
I
'll
throw
the
horse
at
*NL*
you
!
'
when
Sissy
was
recognised
both
by
father
and
daughter
.
But
they
*NL*
got
through
the
Act
with
great
self-possession
;
and
Mr.
Sleary
,
saving
*NL*
for
the
first
instant
,
conveyed
no
more
expression
into
his
locomotive
*NL*
eye
than
into
his
fixed
one
.
The
performance
seemed
a
little
long
to
*NL*
Sissy
and
Louisa
,
particularly
when
it
stopped
to
afford
the
Clown
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
telling
Mr.
Sleary
-LRB-
who
said
`
Indeed
,
sir
!
'
to
all
his
*NL*
observations
in
the
calmest
way
,
and
with
his
eye
on
the
house
-RRB-
about
two
*NL*
legs
sitting
on
three
legs
looking
at
one
leg
,
when
in
came
four
legs
,
*NL*
and
laid
hold
of
one
leg
,
and
up
got
two
legs
,
caught
hold
of
three
legs
,
*NL*
and
threw
'em
at
four
legs
,
who
ran
away
with
one
leg
.
For
,
although
an
*NL*
ingenious
Allegory
relating
to
a
butcher
,
a
three-legged
stool
,
a
dog
,
*NL*
and
a
leg
of
mutton
,
this
narrative
consumed
time
;
and
they
were
in
great
*NL*
suspense
.
At
last
,
however
,
little
fair-haired
Josephine
made
her
*NL*
curtsey
amid
great
applause
;
and
the
Clown
,
left
alone
in
the
ring
,
had
*NL*
just
warmed
himself
,
and
said
,
`
Now
_
I
_
'll
have
a
turn
!
'
when
Sissy
was
*NL*
touched
on
the
shoulder
,
and
beckoned
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
Louisa
with
her
;
and
they
were
received
by
Mr.
Sleary
in
a
very
*NL*
little
private
apartment
,
with
canvas
sides
,
a
grass
floor
,
and
a
wooden
*NL*
ceiling
all
aslant
,
on
which
the
box
company
stamped
their
approbation
,
*NL*
as
if
they
were
coming
through
.
`
Thethilia
,
'
said
Mr.
Sleary
,
who
had
*NL*
brandy
and
water
at
hand
,
`

*NL*
*NL*
These
various
changes
,
Mr.
Sleary
,
very
short
of
breath
now
,
related
with
*NL*
great
heartiness
,
and
with
a
wonderful
kind
of
innocence
,
considering
*NL*
what
a
bleary
and
brandy-and-watery
old
veteran
he
was
.
Afterwards
he
*NL*
brought
in
Josephine
,
and
E.
W.
B.
Childers

rather
deeply
lined
in
the
*NL*
jaws

,
and
the
Little
Wonder
of
Scholastic
Equitation
,
and
in
*NL*
a
word
,
all
the
company
.
Amazing
creatures
they
were
in
Louisa
's
eyes
,
*NL*
so
white
and
pink
of
complexion
,
so
scant
of
dress
,
and
so
demonstrative
*NL*
of
leg
;
but
it
was
very
agreeable
to
see
them
crowding
about
Sissy
,
and
*NL*
very
natural
in
Sissy
to
be
unable
to
refrain
from
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There

As
soon
as

were
gone

he
continued
in

low
tone
.

*NL*
Louisa
uttered
an
exclamation
,
partly
of
distress
,
partly
of
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Louisa
,
with
many
thanks
and
with
a
lightened
load
,
detained
Mr.
Sleary
*NL*
no
longer
then
.
She
left
her
love
for
her
brother
,
with
her
eyes
full
of
*NL*
tears
;
and
she
and
Sissy
went
away
until
later
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
arrived
within
an
hour
afterwards
.
He
too
had
encountered
*NL*
no
one
whom
he
knew
;
and
was
now
sanguine
with
Sleary
's
assistance
,
of
*NL*
getting
his
disgraced
son
to
Liverpool
in
the
night
.
As
neither
of
the
*NL*
three
could
be
his
companion
without
almost
identifying
him
under
any
*NL*
disguise
,
he
prepared
a
letter
to
a
correspondent
whom
he
could
trust
,
*NL*
beseeching
him
to
ship
the
bearer
off
at
any
cost
,
to
North
or
South
*NL*
America
,
or
any
distant
part
of
the
world
to
which
he
could
be
the
most
*NL*
speedily
and
privately
dispatched
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
done
,
they
walked
about
,
waiting
for
the
Circus
to
be
quite
vacated
;
*NL*
not
only
by
the
audience
,
but
by
the
company
and
by
the
horses
.
After
*NL*
watching
it
a
long
time
,
they
saw
Mr.
Sleary
bring
out
a
chair
and
sit
*NL*
down
by
the
side-door
,
smoking
;
as
if
that
were
his
signal
that
they
*NL*
might
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
thervant
,
Thquire
,
'
was
his
cautious
salutation
as
they
passed
in
.
*NL*
`
If
you
want
me
you
'll
find
me
here
.
You
muth
n't
mind
your
thon
having
a
*NL*
comic
livery
on
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
three
went
in
;
and
Mr.
Gradgrind
sat
down
forlorn
,
on
the
*NL*
Clown
's
performing
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
.
On
one
of
the
back
*NL*
benches
,
remote
in
the
subdued
light
and
the
strangeness
of
the
place
,
*NL*
sat
the
villainous
whelp
,
sulky
to
the
last
,
whom
he
had
the
misery
to
*NL*
call
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
preposterous
coat
,
like
a
beadle
's
,
with
cuffs
and
flaps
exaggerated
*NL*
to
an
unspeakable
extent
;
in
an
immense
waistcoat
,
knee-breeches
,
buckled
*NL*
shoes
,
and
a
mad
cocked
hat
;
with
nothing
fitting
him
,
and
everything
of
*NL*
coarse
material
,
moth-eaten
and
full
of
holes
;
with
seams
in
his
black
*NL*
face
,
where
fear
and
heat
had
started
through
the
greasy
composition
*NL*
daubed
all
over
it
;
anything
so
grimly
,
detestably
,
ridiculously
shameful
*NL*
as
the
whelp
in
his
comic
livery
,
Mr.
Gradgrind
never
could
by
any
other
*NL*
means
have
believed
in
,
weighable
and
measurable
fact
though
it
was
.
And
*NL*
one
of
his
model
children
had
come
to
this
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
the
whelp
would
not
draw
any
nearer
,
but
persisted
in
remaining
*NL*
up
there
by
himself
.
Yielding
at
length
,
if
any
concession
so
sullenly
*NL*
made
can
be
called
yielding
,
to
the
entreaties
of
Sissy
--
for
Louisa
he
*NL*
disowned
altogether
--
he
came
down
,
bench
by
bench
,
until
he
stood
in
the
*NL*
sawdust
,
on
the
verge
of
the
circle
,
as
far
as
possible
,
within
its
*NL*
limits
from
where
his
father
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
was
this
done
?
'
asked
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
was
what
done
?
'
moodily
answered
the
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
robbery
,
'
said
the
father
,
raising
his
voice
upon
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
forced
the
safe
myself
over
night
,
and
shut
it
up
ajar
before
I
went
*NL*
away
.
I
had
had
the
key
that
was
found
,
made
long
before
.
I
dropped
it
*NL*
that
morning
,
that
it
might
be
supposed
to
have
been
used
.
I
did
n't
take
*NL*
the
money
all
at
once
.
I
pretended
to
put
my
balance
away
every
night
,
*NL*
but
I
did
n't
.
Now
you
know
all
about
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
on
me
,
'
said
the
father
,
`
it
would
have
*NL*
shocked
me
less
than
this
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
see
why
,
'
grumbled
the
son
.
`
So
many
people
are
employed
in
*NL*
situations
of
trust
;
so
many
people
,
out
of
so
many
,
will
be
dishonest
.
*NL*
I
have
heard
you
talk
,
a
hundred
times
,
of
its
being
a
law
.
How
can
_
I
_
*NL*
help
laws
?
You
have
comforted
others
with
such
things
,
father
.
Comfort
*NL*
yourself
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
,
and
the
son
stood
in
his
*NL*
disgraceful
grotesqueness
,
biting
straw
:
his
hands
,
with
the
black
partly
*NL*
worn
away
inside
,
looking
like
the
hands
of
a
monkey
.
The
evening
was
*NL*
fast
closing
in
;
and
from
time
to
time
,
he
turned
the
whites
of
his
eyes
*NL*
restlessly
and
impatiently
towards
his
father
.
They
were
the
only
parts
*NL*
of
his
face
that
showed
any
life
or
expression
,
the
pigment
upon
it
was
*NL*
so
thick
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
be
got
to
Liverpool
,
and
sent
abroad
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
I
must
.
I
ca
n't
be
more
miserable
anywhere
,
'
whimpered
the
*NL*
whelp
,
`
than
I
have
been
here
,
ever
since
I
can
remember
.
That
's
one
*NL*
thing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
went
to
the
door
,
and
returned
with
Sleary
,
to
whom
he
*NL*
submitted
the
question
,
How
to
get
this
deplorable
object
away
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
've
been

groaned
Mr.

.
`
Will

*NL*
*NL*

I
do

that

thould

Thay

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Gradgrind
rapidly
assented
;
Mr.
Sleary
rapidly
turned
out
from
a
box
,
*NL*
a
smock
frock
,
a
felt
hat
,
and
other
essentials
;
the
whelp
rapidly
*NL*
changed
clothes
behind
a
screen
of
baize
;
Mr.
Sleary
rapidly
brought
*NL*
beer
,
and
washed
him
white
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now

'
said
Sleary
,
`
come
along
to
the
coath
,
and
jump
up
behind

I
'll
go

they
'll

*NL*
farewell

tharp
`
th
the

With
which
he
*NL*
delicately
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
is
your
letter
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
.
`
All
necessary
means
will
be
*NL*
provided
for
you

Atone
,
by
repentance
and
better
conduct

for
the
*NL*
shocking
action
you
have
committed
,
and
the
dreadful
consequences
to

it
has
led

my

boy

may
God
forgive

'
*NL*
*NL*
The
culprit
was
moved
to
a
few
abject
tears
by
these
words
and
their
*NL*
pathetic
tone
.
But
,
when
Louisa
opened
her
arms
,
he
repulsed
her
afresh
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
you
.
I
do
n't
want
to
have
anything

say
to

*NL*

O

after

*NL*
*NL*
`
After

he
returned
,
obdurately
.
`
Pretty
love
!
Leaving
*NL*
old
Bounderby
to
himself
,
and
packing
my
best
friend
Mr.
Harthouse
off
,
*NL*
and
going
home
just
when
I
was
in
the
greatest
danger

Pretty

Coming
out
with
every
word
about

having
gone
to

place

when

saw
the
net
was
gathering
round
me

`
Tharp
`
th
the

'
said
Sleary
,
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
confusedly
went
out
:
Louisa
crying
to
him
that
she
forgave
him
,
*NL*
and
loved
him
still
,
and
that
he
would
one
day
be
sorry
to
have
left
her
*NL*
so
,
and
glad
to
think
of
these
her
last
words
,
far
away
:
when
some
one
*NL*
ran
against
them
.
Mr.
Gradgrind
and
Sissy
,
who
were
both
before
him
*NL*
while
his
sister
yet
clung
to
his
shoulder
,
stopped
and
recoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
there
was
Bitzer
,
out
of
breath
,
his
thin
lips
parted
,
his
thin
*NL*
nostrils
distended
,
his
white
eyelashes
quivering
,
his
colourless
face
*NL*
more
colourless
than
ever
,
as
if
he
ran
himself
into
a
white
heat
,
when
*NL*
other
people
ran
themselves
into
a
glow
.
There
he
stood
,
panting
and
*NL*
heaving
,
as
if
he
had
never
stopped
since
the
night
,
now
long
ago
,
when
*NL*
he
had
run
them
down
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
sorry
to
interfere
with
your
plans
,
'
said
Bitzer
,
shaking
his
head
,
*NL*
`
but
I
ca
n't
allow
myself
to
be
done
by
horse-riders
.
I
must
have
young
*NL*
Mr.
Tom
;
he
must
n't
be
got
away
by
horse-riders
;
here
he
is
in
a
smock
*NL*
frock
,
and
I
must
have
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
collar
,
too
,
it
seemed
.
For
,
so
he
took
possession
of
him
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
PHILOSOPHICAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THEY
went
back
into
the
booth
,
Sleary
shutting
the
door
to
keep
intruders
*NL*
out
.
Bitzer
,
still
holding
the
paralysed
culprit
by
the
collar
,
stood
in
*NL*
the
Ring
,
blinking
at
his
old
patron
through
the
darkness
of
the
*NL*
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bitzer
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
broken
down
,
and
miserably
submissive
to
*NL*
him
,
`
have
you
a
heart
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
circulation
,
sir
,
'
returned
Bitzer
,
smiling
at
the
oddity
of
the
*NL*
question
,
`
could
n't
be
carried
on
without
one
.
No
man
,
sir
,
acquainted
*NL*
with
the
facts
established
by
Harvey
relating
to
the
circulation
of
the
*NL*
blood
,
can
doubt
that
I
have
a
heart
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
accessible
,
'
cried
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
to
any
compassionate
*NL*
influence
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
accessible
to
Reason
,
sir
,
'
returned
the
excellent
young
man
.
*NL*
`
And
to
nothing
else
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
looking
at
each
other
;
Mr.
Gradgrind
's
face
as
white
as
the
*NL*
pursuer
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
motive
--
even
what
motive
in
reason
--
can
you
have
for
preventing
the
*NL*
escape
of
this
wretched
youth
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
and
crushing
his
*NL*
miserable
father
?
See
his
sister
here
.
Pity
us
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
returned
Bitzer
,
in
a
very
business-like
and
logical
manner
,
*NL*
`
since
you
ask
me
what
motive
I
have
in
reason
,
for
taking
young
Mr.
Tom
*NL*
back
to
Coketown
,
it
is
only
reasonable
to
let
you
know
.
I
have
*NL*
suspected
young
Mr.
Tom
of
this
bank-robbery
from
the
first
.
I
had
had
*NL*
my
eye
upon
him
before
that
time
,
for
I
knew
his
ways
.
I
have
kept
my
*NL*
observations
to
myself
,
but
I
have
made
them
;
and
I
have
got
ample
proofs
*NL*
against
him
now
,
besides
his
running
away
,
and
besides
his
own
*NL*
confession
,
which
I
was
just
in
time
to
overhear
.
I
had
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
watching
your
house
yesterday
morning
,
and
following
you
here
.
I
am
*NL*
going
to
take
young
Mr.
Tom
back
to
Coketown
,
in
order
to
deliver
him
*NL*
over
to
Mr.
Bounderby
.
Sir
,
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
Mr.
Bounderby
*NL*
will
then
promote
me
to
young
Mr.
Tom
's
situation
.
And
I
wish
to
have
*NL*
his
situation
,
sir
,
for
it
will
be
a
rise
to
me
,
and
will
do
me
good
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
this
is
solely
a
question
of
self-interest
with
you
--
'
Mr.
Gradgrind
*NL*
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
for
interrupting
you
,
sir
,
'
returned
Bitzer
;
`
but
I
am
*NL*
sure
you
know
that
the
whole
social
system
is
a
question
of
*NL*
self-interest
.
What
you
must
always
appeal
to
,
is
a
person
's
*NL*
self-interest
.
It
's
your
only
hold
.
We
are
so
constituted
.
I
was
*NL*
brought
up
in
that
catechism
when
I
was
very
young
,
sir
,
as
you
are
*NL*
aware
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
sum
of
money
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
`
will
you
set
against
your
*NL*
expected
promotion
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
sir
,
'
returned
Bitzer
,
`
for
hinting
at
the
proposal
;
but
I
*NL*
will
not
set
any
sum
against
it
.
Knowing
that
your
clear
head
would
*NL*
propose
that
alternative
,
I
have
gone
over
the
calculations
in
my
mind
;
*NL*
and
I
find
that
to
compound
a
felony
,
even
on
very
high
terms
indeed
,
*NL*
would
not
be
as
safe
and
good
for
me
as
my
improved
prospects
in
the
*NL*
Bank
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bitzer
,
'
said
Mr.
Gradgrind
,
stretching
out
his
hands
as
though
he
would
*NL*
have
said
,
See
how
miserable
I
am
!
`
Bitzer
,
I
have
but
one
chance
left
*NL*
to
soften
you
.
You
were
many
years
at
my
school
.
If
,
in
remembrance
of
*NL*
the
pains
bestowed
upon
you
there
,
you
can
persuade
yourself
in
any
*NL*
degree
to
disregard
your
present
interest
and
release
my
son
,
I
entreat
*NL*
and
pray
you
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
that
remembrance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
really
wonder
,
sir
,
'
rejoined
the
old
pupil
in
an
argumentative
*NL*
manner
,
`
to
find
you
taking
a
position
so
untenable
.
My
schooling
was
*NL*
paid
for
;
it
was
a
bargain
;
and
when
I
came
away
,
the
bargain
ended
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
Gradgrind
philosophy
that
*NL*
everything
was
to
be
paid
for
.
Nobody
was
ever
on
any
account
to
give
*NL*
anybody
anything
,
or
render
anybody
help
without
purchase
.
Gratitude
was
*NL*
to
be
abolished
,
and
the
virtues
springing
from
it
were
not
to
be
.
Every
*NL*
inch
of
the
existence
of
mankind
,
from
birth
to
death
,
was
to
be
a
*NL*
bargain
across
a
counter
.
And
if
we
did
n't
get
to
Heaven
that
way
,
it
*NL*
was
not
a
politico-economical
place
,
and
we
had
no
business
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
deny
,
'
added
Bitzer
,
`
that
my
schooling
was
cheap
.
But
that
*NL*
comes
right
,
sir
.
I
was
made
in
the
cheapest
market
,
and
have
to
dispose
*NL*
of
myself
in
the
dearest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
little
troubled
here
,
by
Louisa
and
Sissy
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pray
do
n't
do
that
,
'
said
he
,
`
it
's
of
no
use
doing
that
:
it
only
*NL*
worries
.
You
seem
to
think
that
I
have
some
animosity
against
young
Mr.
*NL*
Tom
;
whereas
I
have
none
at
all
.
I
am
only
going
,
on
the
reasonable
*NL*
grounds
I
have
mentioned
,
to
take
him
back
to
Coketown
.
If
he
was
to
*NL*
resist
,
I
should
set
up
the
cry
of
Stop
thief
!
But
,
he
wo
n't
resist
,
you
*NL*
may
depend
upon
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sleary
,
who
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
rolling
eye
as
immovably
*NL*
jammed
in
his
head
as
his
fixed
one
,
had
listened
to
these
doctrines
with
*NL*
profound
attention
,
here
stepped
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thquire
,
you

perfectly
well

*NL*
*NL*
Fresh
lamentations
from
Louisa
,
and
deeper
affliction
on
Mr.
Gradgrind
's
*NL*
part
,
followed
this
desertion
of
them
by
their
last
friend
.
But
,
Sissy
*NL*
glanced
at
him
with
great
attention
;
nor
did
she
in
her
own
breast
*NL*
misunderstand
him
.
As
they
were
all
going
out
again
,
he
favoured
her
*NL*
with
one
slight
roll
of
his
movable
eye
,
desiring
her
to
linger
behind
.
*NL*
As
he
locked
the
door
,
he
said
excitedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
Thquire

Thethilia

and
I
'll
thtand

It
'll
be
a
*NL*
dark
night
;
I
've
got
a
horthe
that
'll
do
anything
but
thpeak
;
I
've
got
a
*NL*
pony
that
'll
go
fifteen
mile
an
hour
with
Childerth
driving
of
him
;
I
've
*NL*
got
a
dog
that
'll
keep
a
man
to
one
plathe
four-and-twenty
hourth
.
Get
a
*NL*
word
with
the
young
Thquire

Tell

when

not
to
be
afraid
of

thpilt

up

Tharp
`
th
the
word
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
was
so
sharp
,
that
in
ten
minutes
Mr.
Childers
,
sauntering
about
*NL*
the
market-place
in
a
pair
of
slippers
,
had
his
cue
,
and
Mr.
Sleary
's
*NL*
equipage
was
ready
.
It
was
a
fine
sight
,
to
behold
the
learned
dog
*NL*
barking
round
it
,
and
Mr.
Sleary
instructing
him
,
with
his
one
*NL*
practicable
eye
,
that
Bitzer
was
the
object
of
his
particular
attentions
.
*NL*
Soon
after
dark
they
all
three
got
in
and
started
;
the
learned
dog
-LRB-
a
*NL*
formidable
creature
-RRB-
already
pinning
Bitzer
with
his
eye
,
and
sticking
*NL*
close
to
the
wheel
on
his
side
,
that
he
might
be
ready
for
him
in
the
*NL*
event
of
his
showing
the
slightest
disposition
to
alight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
three
sat
up
at
the
inn
all
night
in
great
suspense
.
At
eight
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
Mr.
Sleary
and
the
dog
reappeared
:
both
in
high
*NL*
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All

'
said
Mr.
Sleary
,
`
your

Childerth
took
him
off

*NL*
Mr.

overwhelmed
him
with
thanks

hinted
as

delicately
as

could
,
at

handsome
remuneration

All

seemed

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
FINAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
see
anything
in
the
sphere
of
a
vain
*NL*
blusterer
,
before
the
vain
blusterer
sees
it
himself
.
Mr.
Bounderby
felt
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Sparsit
had
audaciously
anticipated
him
,
and
presumed
to
be
*NL*
wiser
than
he
.
Inappeasably
indignant
with
her
for
her
triumphant
*NL*
discovery
of
Mrs.
Pegler
,
he
turned
this
presumption
,
on
the
part
of
a
*NL*
woman
in
her
dependent
position
,
over
and
over
in
his
mind
,
until
it
*NL*
accumulated
with
turning
like
a
great
snowball
.
At
last
he
made
the
*NL*
discovery
that
to
discharge
this
highly
connected
female
--
to
have
it
in
*NL*
his
power
to
say
,
`
She
was
a
woman
of
family
,
and
wanted
to
stick
to
me
,
*NL*
but
I
would
n't
have
it
,
and
got
rid
of
her
'
--
would
be
to
get
the
utmost
*NL*
possible
amount
of
crowning
glory
out
of
the
connection
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
to
punish
Mrs.
Sparsit
according
to
her
deserts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Filled
fuller
than
ever
,
with
this
great
idea
,
Mr.
Bounderby
came
in
to
*NL*
lunch
,
and
sat
himself
down
in
the
dining-room
of
former
days
,
where
his
*NL*
portrait
was
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
sat
by
the
fire
,
with
her
foot
in
her
cotton
*NL*
stirrup
,
little
thinking
whither
she
was
posting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
Pegler
affair
,
this
gentlewoman
had
covered
her
pity
for
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
with
a
veil
of
quiet
melancholy
and
contrition
.
In
virtue
*NL*
thereof
,
it
had
become
her
habit
to
assume
a
woful
look
,
which
woful
look
*NL*
she
now
bestowed
upon
her
patron
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
matter
now
,
ma'am
?
'
said
Mr.
Bounderby
,
in
a
very
short
,
*NL*
rough
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pray
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
do
not
bite
my
nose
off
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bite
your
nose
off
,
ma'am
?
'
repeated
Mr.
Bounderby
.
'
_
Your
_
nose
!
'
*NL*
meaning
,
as
Mrs.
Sparsit
conceived
,
that
it
was
too
developed
a
nose
for
*NL*
the
purpose
.
After
which
offensive
implication
,
he
cut
himself
a
crust
*NL*
of
bread
,
and
threw
the
knife
down
with
a
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
took
her
foot
out
of
her
stirrup
,
and
said
,
`
Mr.
Bounderby
,
*NL*
sir
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
ma'am
?
'
retorted
Mr.
Bounderby
.
`
What
are
you
staring
at
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
May
I
ask
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
`
have
you
been
ruffled
this
*NL*
morning
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
May
I
inquire
,
sir
,
'
pursued
the
injured
woman
,
`
whether
_
I
_
am
the
*NL*
unfortunate
cause
of
your
having
lost
your
temper
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
'
I
am
not
come
here
to
*NL*
be
bullied
.
A
female
may
be
highly
connected
,
but
she
ca
n't
be
permitted
*NL*
to
bother
and
badger
a
man
in
my
position
,
and
I
am
not
going
to
put
up
*NL*
with
it
.
'
-LRB-
Mr.
Bounderby
felt
it
necessary
to
get
on
:
foreseeing
that
if
*NL*
he
allowed
of
details
,
he
would
be
beaten
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
first
elevated
,
then
knitted
,
her
Coriolanian
eyebrows
;
*NL*
gathered
up
her
work
into
its
proper
basket
;
and
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
said
she
,
majestically
.
`
It
is
apparent
to
me
that
I
am
in
your
*NL*
way
at
present
.
I
will
retire
to
my
own
apartment
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Allow
me
to
open
the
door
,
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
,
sir
;
I
can
do
it
for
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
had
better
allow
me
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
passing
her
,
and
*NL*
getting
his
hand
upon
the
lock
;
`
because
I
can
take
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
saying
a
word
to
you
,
before
you
go
.
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
I
rather
think
*NL*
you
are
cramped
here
,
do
you
know
?
It
appears
to
me
,
that
,
under
my
*NL*
humble
roof
,
there
's
hardly
opening
enough
for
a
lady
of
your
genius
in
*NL*
other
people
's
affairs
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sparsit
gave
him
a
look
of
the
darkest
scorn
,
and
said
with
great
*NL*
politeness
,
`
Really
,
sir
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
been
thinking
it
over
,
you
see
,
since
the
late
affairs
have
*NL*
happened
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
;
`
and
it
appears
to
my
poor
judgment
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
Pray
,
sir
,
'
Mrs.
Sparsit
interposed
,
with
sprightly
cheerfulness
,
*NL*
`
do
n't
disparage
your
judgment
.
Everybody
knows
how
unerring
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
's
judgment
is
.
Everybody
has
had
proofs
of
it
.
It
must
be
the
*NL*
theme
of
general
conversation
.
Disparage
anything
in
yourself
but
your
*NL*
judgment
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bounderby
,
very
red
and
uncomfortable
,
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
appears
to
me
,
ma'am
,
I
say
,
that
a
different
sort
of
establishment
*NL*
altogether
would
bring
out
a
lady
of
_
your
_
powers
.
Such
an
*NL*
establishment
as
your
relation
,
Lady
Scadgers
's
,
now
.
Do
n't
you
think
*NL*
you
might
find
some
affairs
there
,
ma'am
,
to
interfere
with
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
never
occurred
to
me
before
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
;
`
but
now
*NL*
you
mention
it
,
should
think
it
highly
probable
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
suppose
you
try
,
ma'am
,
'
said
Bounderby
,
laying
an
envelope
with
a
*NL*
cheque
in
it
in
her
little
basket
.
`
You
can
take
your
own
time
for
*NL*
going
,
ma'am
;
but
perhaps
in
the
meanwhile
,
it
will
be
more
agreeable
to
*NL*
a
lady
of
your
powers
of
mind
,
to
eat
her
meals
by
herself
,
and
not
to
be
*NL*
intruded
upon
.
I
really
ought
to
apologise
to
you
--
being
only
Josiah
*NL*
Bounderby
of
Coketown
--
for
having
stood
in
your
light
so
long
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pray
do
n't
name
it
,
sir
,
'
returned
Mrs.
Sparsit
.
`
If
that
portrait
*NL*
could
speak
,
sir
--
but
it
has
the
advantage
over
the
original
of
not
*NL*
possessing
the
power
of
committing
itself
and
disgusting
others
,
--
it
would
*NL*
testify
,
that
a
long
period
has
elapsed
since
I
first
habitually
*NL*
addressed
it
as
the
picture
of
a
Noodle
.
Nothing
that
a
Noodle
does
,
can
*NL*
awaken
surprise
or
indignation
;
the
proceedings
of
a
Noodle
can
only
*NL*
inspire
contempt
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
saying
,
Mrs.
Sparsit
,
with
her
Roman
features
like
a
medal
struck
to
*NL*
commemorate
her
scorn
of
Mr.
Bounderby
,
surveyed
him
fixedly
from
head
to
*NL*
foot
,
swept
disdainfully
past
him
,
and
ascended
the
staircase
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bounderby
closed
the
door
,
and
stood
before
the
fire
;
projecting
himself
*NL*
after
his
old
explosive
manner
into
his
portrait
--
and
into
futurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Into
how
much
of
futurity
?
He
saw
Mrs.
Sparsit
fighting
out
a
daily
*NL*
fight
at
the
points
of
all
the
weapons
in
the
female
armoury
,
with
the
*NL*
grudging
,
smarting
,
peevish
,
tormenting
Lady
Scadgers
,
still
laid
up
in
*NL*
bed
with
her
mysterious
leg
,
and
gobbling
her
insufficient
income
down
by
*NL*
about
the
middle
of
every
quarter
,
in
a
mean
little
airless
lodging
,
a
*NL*
mere
closet
for
one
,
a
mere
crib
for
two
;
but
did
he
see
more
?
Did
he
*NL*
catch
any
glimpse
of
himself
making
a
show
of
Bitzer
to
strangers
,
as
the
*NL*
rising
young
man
,
so
devoted
to
his
master
's
great
merits
,
who
had
won
*NL*
young
Tom
's
place
,
and
had
almost
captured
young
Tom
himself
,
in
the
*NL*
times
when
by
various
rascals
he
was
spirited
away
?
Did
he
see
any
faint
*NL*
reflection
of
his
own
image
making
a
vain-glorious
will
,
whereby
*NL*
five-and-twenty
Humbugs
,
past
five-and-fifty
years
of
age
,
each
taking
*NL*
upon
himself
the
name
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
should
for
ever
dine
*NL*
in
Bounderby
Hall
,
for
ever
lodge
in
Bounderby
buildings
,
for
ever
attend
*NL*
a
Bounderby
chapel
,
for
ever
go
to
sleep
under
a
Bounderby
chaplain
,
for
*NL*
ever
be
supported
out
of
a
Bounderby
estate
,
and
for
ever
nauseate
all
*NL*
healthy
stomachs
,
with
a
vast
amount
of
Bounderby
balderdash
and
bluster
?
*NL*
Had
he
any
prescience
of
the
day
,
five
years
to
come
,
when
Josiah
*NL*
Bounderby
of
Coketown
was
to
die
of
a
fit
in
the
Coketown
street
,
and
*NL*
this
same
precious
will
was
to
begin
its
long
career
of
quibble
,
plunder
,
*NL*
false
pretences
,
vile
example
,
little
service
and
much
law
?
Probably
*NL*
not
.
Yet
the
portrait
was
to
see
it
all
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
Mr.
Gradgrind
on
the
same
day
,
and
in
the
same
hour
,
sitting
*NL*
thoughtful
in
his
own
room
.
How
much
of
futurity
did
_
he
_
see
?
Did
he
*NL*
see
himself
,
a
white-haired
decrepit
man
,
bending
his
hitherto
inflexible
*NL*
theories
to
appointed
circumstances
;
making
his
facts
and
figures
*NL*
subservient
to
Faith
,
Hope
,
and
Charity
;
and
no
longer
trying
to
grind
*NL*
that
Heavenly
trio
in
his
dusty
little
mills
?
Did
he
catch
sight
of
*NL*
himself
,
therefore
much
despised
by
his
late
political
associates
?
Did
*NL*
he
see
them
,
in
the
era
of
its
being
quite
settled
that
the
national
*NL*
dustmen
have
only
to
do
with
one
another
,
and
owe
no
duty
to
an
*NL*
abstraction
called
a
People
,
`
taunting
the
honourable
gentleman
'
with
*NL*
this
and
with
that
and
with
what
not
,
five
nights
a-week
,
until
the
small
*NL*
hours
of
the
morning
?
Probably
he
had
that
much
foreknowledge
,
knowing
*NL*
his
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
Louisa
on
the
night
of
the
same
day
,
watching
the
fire
as
in
*NL*
days
of
yore
,
though
with
a
gentler
and
a
humbler
face
.
How
much
of
the
*NL*
future
might
arise
before
_
her
_
vision
?
Broadsides
in
the
streets
,
*NL*
signed
with
her
father
's
name
,
exonerating
the
late
Stephen
Blackpool
,
*NL*
weaver
,
from
misplaced
suspicion
,
and
publishing
the
guilt
of
his
own
*NL*
son
,
with
such
extenuation
as
his
years
and
temptation
-LRB-
he
could
not
*NL*
bring
himself
to
add
,
his
education
-RRB-
might
beseech
;
were
of
the
Present
.
*NL*
So
,
Stephen
Blackpool
's
tombstone
,
with
her
father
's
record
of
his
death
,
*NL*
was
almost
of
the
Present
,
for
she
knew
it
was
to
be
.
These
things
she
*NL*
could
plainly
see
.
But
,
how
much
of
the
Future
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
working
woman
,
christened
Rachael
,
after
a
long
illness
once
again
*NL*
appearing
at
the
ringing
of
the
Factory
bell
,
and
passing
to
and
fro
at
*NL*
the
set
hours
,
among
the
Coketown
Hands
;
a
woman
of
pensive
beauty
,
*NL*
always
dressed
in
black
,
but
sweet-tempered
and
serene
,
and
even
*NL*
cheerful
;
who
,
of
all
the
people
in
the
place
,
alone
appeared
to
have
*NL*
compassion
on
a
degraded
,
drunken
wretch
of
her
own
sex
,
who
was
*NL*
sometimes
seen
in
the
town
secretly
begging
of
her
,
and
crying
to
her
;
a
*NL*
woman
working
,
ever
working
,
but
content
to
do
it
,
and
preferring
to
do
*NL*
it
as
her
natural
lot
,
until
she
should
be
too
old
to
labour
any
more
?
*NL*
Did
Louisa
see
this
?
Such
a
thing
was
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lonely
brother
,
many
thousands
of
miles
away
,
writing
,
on
paper
blotted
*NL*
with
tears
,
that
her
words
had
too
soon
come
true
,
and
that
all
the
*NL*
treasures
in
the
world
would
be
cheaply
bartered
for
a
sight
of
her
dear
*NL*
face
?
At
length
this
brother
coming
nearer
home
,
with
hope
of
seeing
*NL*
her
,
and
being
delayed
by
illness
;
and
then
a
letter
,
in
a
strange
hand
,
*NL*
saying
`
he
died
in
hospital
,
of
fever
,
such
a
day
,
and
died
in
penitence
*NL*
and
love
of
you
:
his
last
word
being
your
name
'
?
Did
Louisa
see
these
*NL*
things
?
Such
things
were
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herself
again
a
wife
--
a
mother
--
lovingly
watchful
of
her
children
,
ever
*NL*
careful
that
they
should
have
a
childhood
of
the
mind
no
less
than
a
*NL*
childhood
of
the
body
,
as
knowing
it
to
be
even
a
more
beautiful
thing
,
*NL*
and
a
possession
,
any
hoarded
scrap
of
which
,
is
a
blessing
and
happiness
*NL*
to
the
wisest
?
Did
Louisa
see
this
?
Such
a
thing
was
never
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
happy
Sissy
's
happy
children
loving
her
;
all
children
loving
her
;
*NL*
she
,
grown
learned
in
childish
lore
;
thinking
no
innocent
and
pretty
*NL*
fancy
ever
to
be
despised
;
trying
hard
to
know
her
humbler
*NL*
fellow-creatures
,
and
to
beautify
their
lives
of
machinery
and
reality
*NL*
with
those
imaginative
graces
and
delights
,
without
which
the
heart
of
*NL*
infancy
will
wither
up
,
the
sturdiest
physical
manhood
will
be
morally
*NL*
stark
death
,
and
the
plainest
national
prosperity
figures
can
show
,
will
*NL*
be
the
Writing
on
the
Wall
,
--
she
holding
this
course
as
part
of
no
*NL*
fantastic
vow
,
or
bond
,
or
brotherhood
,
or
sisterhood
,
or
pledge
,
or
*NL*
covenant
,
or
fancy
dress
,
or
fancy
fair
;
but
simply
as
a
duty
to
be
*NL*
done
,
--
did
Louisa
see
these
things
of
herself
?
These
things
were
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
reader
!
It
rests
with
you
and
me
,
whether
,
in
our
two
fields
of
*NL*
action
,
similar
things
shall
be
or
not
.
Let
them
be
!
We
shall
sit
with
*NL*
lighter
bosoms
on
the
hearth
,
to
see
the
ashes
of
our
fires
turn
gray
and
*NL*
cold
