HEART
OF
DARKNESS
*NL*
*NL*
By
Joseph
Conrad

I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Nellie
,
a
cruising
yawl
,
swung
to
her
anchor
without
a
flutter
of
*NL*
the
sails
,
and
was
at
rest
.
The
flood
had
made
,
the
wind
was
nearly
*NL*
calm
,
and
being
bound
down
the
river
,
the
only
thing
for
it
was
to
come
*NL*
to
and
wait
for
the
turn
of
the
tide
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sea-reach
of
the
Thames
stretched
before
us
like
the
beginning
of
*NL*
an
interminable
waterway
.
In
the
offing
the
sea
and
the
sky
were
welded
*NL*
together
without
a
joint
,
and
in
the
luminous
space
the
tanned
sails
*NL*
of
the
barges
drifting
up
with
the
tide
seemed
to
stand
still
in
red
*NL*
clusters
of
canvas
sharply
peaked
,
with
gleams
of
varnished
sprits
.
A
*NL*
haze
rested
on
the
low
shores
that
ran
out
to
sea
in
vanishing
flatness
.
*NL*
The
air
was
dark
above
Gravesend
,
and
farther
back
still
seemed
*NL*
condensed
into
a
mournful
gloom
,
brooding
motionless
over
the
biggest
,
*NL*
and
the
greatest
,
town
on
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Director
of
Companies
was
our
captain
and
our
host
.
We
four
*NL*
affectionately
watched
his
back
as
he
stood
in
the
bows
looking
to
*NL*
seaward
.
On
the
whole
river
there
was
nothing
that
looked
half
so
*NL*
nautical
.
He
resembled
a
pilot
,
which
to
a
seaman
is
trustworthiness
*NL*
personified
.
It
was
difficult
to
realize
his
work
was
not
out
there
in
*NL*
the
luminous
estuary
,
but
behind
him
,
within
the
brooding
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
us
there
was
,
as
I
have
already
said
somewhere
,
the
bond
of
*NL*
the
sea
.
Besides
holding
our
hearts
together
through
long
periods
of
*NL*
separation
,
it
had
the
effect
of
making
us
tolerant
of
each
other
's
*NL*
yarns
--
and
even
convictions
.
The
Lawyer
--
the
best
of
old
fellows
--
had
,
*NL*
because
of
his
many
years
and
many
virtues
,
the
only
cushion
on
deck
,
*NL*
and
was
lying
on
the
only
rug
.
The
Accountant
had
brought
out
already
a
*NL*
box
of
dominoes
,
and
was
toying
architecturally
with
the
bones
.
Marlow
*NL*
sat
cross-legged
right
aft
,
leaning
against
the
mizzen-mast
.
He
had
*NL*
sunken
cheeks
,
a
yellow
complexion
,
a
straight
back
,
an
ascetic
aspect
,
*NL*
and
,
with
his
arms
dropped
,
the
palms
of
hands
outwards
,
resembled
an
*NL*
idol
.
The
director
,
satisfied
the
anchor
had
good
hold
,
made
his
way
*NL*
aft
and
sat
down
amongst
us
.
We
exchanged
a
few
words
lazily
.
Afterwards
*NL*
there
was
silence
on
board
the
yacht
.
For
some
reason
or
other
we
did
*NL*
not
begin
that
game
of
dominoes
.
We
felt
meditative
,
and
fit
for
nothing
*NL*
but
placid
staring
.
The
day
was
ending
in
a
serenity
of
still
and
*NL*
exquisite
brilliance
.
The
water
shone
pacifically
;
the
sky
,
without
a
*NL*
speck
,
was
a
benign
immensity
of
unstained
light
;
the
very
mist
on
the
*NL*
Essex
marsh
was
like
a
gauzy
and
radiant
fabric
,
hung
from
the
wooded
*NL*
rises
inland
,
and
draping
the
low
shores
in
diaphanous
folds
.
Only
the
*NL*
gloom
to
the
west
,
brooding
over
the
upper
reaches
,
became
more
sombre
*NL*
every
minute
,
as
if
angered
by
the
approach
of
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
last
,
in
its
curved
and
imperceptible
fall
,
the
sun
sank
low
,
and
*NL*
from
glowing
white
changed
to
a
dull
red
without
rays
and
without
heat
,
*NL*
as
if
about
to
go
out
suddenly
,
stricken
to
death
by
the
touch
of
that
*NL*
gloom
brooding
over
a
crowd
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forthwith
a
change
came
over
the
waters
,
and
the
serenity
became
less
*NL*
brilliant
but
more
profound
.
The
old
river
in
its
broad
reach
rested
*NL*
unruffled
at
the
decline
of
day
,
after
ages
of
good
service
done
to
the
*NL*
race
that
peopled
its
banks
,
spread
out
in
the
tranquil
dignity
of
a
*NL*
waterway
leading
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
.
We
looked
at
the
*NL*
venerable
stream
not
in
the
vivid
flush
of
a
short
day
that
comes
and
*NL*
departs
for
ever
,
but
in
the
august
light
of
abiding
memories
.
And
*NL*
indeed
nothing
is
easier
for
a
man
who
has
,
as
the
phrase
goes
,
*NL*
``
followed
the
sea
''
with
reverence
and
affection
,
than
to
evoke
the
*NL*
great
spirit
of
the
past
upon
the
lower
reaches
of
the
Thames
.
The
tidal
*NL*
current
runs
to
and
fro
in
its
unceasing
service
,
crowded
with
memories
*NL*
of
men
and
ships
it
had
borne
to
the
rest
of
home
or
to
the
battles
*NL*
of
the
sea
.
It
had
known
and
served
all
the
men
of
whom
the
nation
is
*NL*
proud
,
from
Sir
Francis
Drake
to
Sir
John
Franklin
,
knights
all
,
titled
*NL*
and
untitled
--
the
great
knights-errant
of
the
sea
.
It
had
borne
all
the
*NL*
ships
whose
names
are
like
jewels
flashing
in
the
night
of
time
,
from
*NL*
the
_
Golden
Hind
_
returning
with
her
rotund
flanks
full
of
treasure
,
to
be
*NL*
visited
by
the
Queen
's
Highness
and
thus
pass
out
of
the
gigantic
tale
,
*NL*
to
the
_
Erebus
_
and
_
Terror
_
,
bound
on
other
conquests
--
and
that
never
*NL*
returned
.
It
had
known
the
ships
and
the
men
.
They
had
sailed
from
*NL*
Deptford
,
from
Greenwich
,
from
Erith
--
the
adventurers
and
the
settlers
;
*NL*
kings
'
ships
and
the
ships
of
men
on
`
Change
;
captains
,
admirals
,
the
*NL*
dark
``
interlopers
''
of
the
Eastern
trade
,
and
the
commissioned
``
generals
''
*NL*
of
East
India
fleets
.
Hunters
for
gold
or
pursuers
of
fame
,
they
all
*NL*
had
gone
out
on
that
stream
,
bearing
the
sword
,
and
often
the
torch
,
*NL*
messengers
of
the
might
within
the
land
,
bearers
of
a
spark
from
the
*NL*
sacred
fire
.
What
greatness
had
not
floated
on
the
ebb
of
that
river
*NL*
into
the
mystery
of
an
unknown
earth
!
...
The
dreams
of
men
,
the
seed
*NL*
of
commonwealths
,
the
germs
of
empires
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
set
;
the
dusk
fell
on
the
stream
,
and
lights
began
to
appear
*NL*
along
the
shore
.
The
Chapman
light-house
,
a
three-legged
thing
erect
*NL*
on
a
mud-flat
,
shone
strongly
.
Lights
of
ships
moved
in
the
fairway
--
a
*NL*
great
stir
of
lights
going
up
and
going
down
.
And
farther
west
on
the
*NL*
upper
reaches
the
place
of
the
monstrous
town
was
still
marked
ominously
*NL*
on
the
sky
,
a
brooding
gloom
in
sunshine
,
a
lurid
glare
under
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
also
,
''
said
Marlow
suddenly
,
``
has
been
one
of
the
dark
places
*NL*
of
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
only
man
of
us
who
still
``
followed
the
sea
.
''
The
worst
that
*NL*
could
be
said
of
him
was
that
he
did
not
represent
his
class
.
He
was
a
*NL*
seaman
,
but
he
was
a
wanderer
,
too
,
while
most
seamen
lead
,
if
one
may
*NL*
so
express
it
,
a
sedentary
life
.
Their
minds
are
of
the
stay-at-home
*NL*
order
,
and
their
home
is
always
with
them
--
the
ship
;
and
so
is
their
*NL*
country
--
the
sea
.
One
ship
is
very
much
like
another
,
and
the
sea
is
*NL*
always
the
same
.
In
the
immutability
of
their
surroundings
the
foreign
*NL*
shores
,
the
foreign
faces
,
the
changing
immensity
of
life
,
glide
past
,
*NL*
veiled
not
by
a
sense
of
mystery
but
by
a
slightly
disdainful
ignorance
;
*NL*
for
there
is
nothing
mysterious
to
a
seaman
unless
it
be
the
sea
itself
,
*NL*
which
is
the
mistress
of
his
existence
and
as
inscrutable
as
Destiny
.
*NL*
For
the
rest
,
after
his
hours
of
work
,
a
casual
stroll
or
a
casual
spree
*NL*
on
shore
suffices
to
unfold
for
him
the
secret
of
a
whole
continent
,
*NL*
and
generally
he
finds
the
secret
not
worth
knowing
.
The
yarns
of
seamen
*NL*
have
a
direct
simplicity
,
the
whole
meaning
of
which
lies
within
the
*NL*
shell
of
a
cracked
nut
.
But
Marlow
was
not
typical
-LRB-
if
his
propensity
*NL*
to
spin
yarns
be
excepted
-RRB-
,
and
to
him
the
meaning
of
an
episode
was
not
*NL*
inside
like
a
kernel
but
outside
,
enveloping
the
tale
which
brought
it
*NL*
out
only
as
a
glow
brings
out
a
haze
,
in
the
likeness
of
one
of
these
*NL*
misty
halos
that
sometimes
are
made
visible
by
the
spectral
illumination
*NL*
of
moonshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
remark
did
not
seem
at
all
surprising
.
It
was
just
like
Marlow
.
*NL*
It
was
accepted
in
silence
.
No
one
took
the
trouble
to
grunt
even
;
and
*NL*
presently
he
said
,
very
slow
--
``
I
was
thinking
of
very
old
times
,
when
*NL*
the
Romans
first
came
here
,
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
--
the
other
day
*NL*
...
Light
came
out
of
this
river
since
--
you
say
Knights
?
Yes
;
but
*NL*
it
is
like
a
running
blaze
on
a
plain
,
like
a
flash
of
lightning
in
the
*NL*
clouds
.
We
live
in
the
flicker
--
may
it
last
as
long
as
the
old
earth
*NL*
keeps
rolling
!
But
darkness
was
here
yesterday
.
Imagine
the
feelings
*NL*
of
a
commander
of
a
fine
--
what
d'ye
call
'em
?
--
trireme
in
the
*NL*
Mediterranean
,
ordered
suddenly
to
the
north
;
run
overland
across
the
*NL*
Gauls
in
a
hurry
;
put
in
charge
of
one
of
these
craft
the
legionaries
--
a
*NL*
wonderful
lot
of
handy
men
they
must
have
been
,
too
--
used
to
build
,
*NL*
apparently
by
the
hundred
,
in
a
month
or
two
,
if
we
may
believe
what
we
*NL*
read
.
Imagine
him
here
--
the
very
end
of
the
world
,
a
sea
the
colour
*NL*
of
lead
,
a
sky
the
colour
of
smoke
,
a
kind
of
ship
about
as
rigid
as
a
*NL*
concertina
--
and
going
up
this
river
with
stores
,
or
orders
,
or
what
you
*NL*
like
.
Sand-banks
,
marshes
,
forests
,
savages
,
--
precious
little
to
eat
*NL*
fit
for
a
civilized
man
,
nothing
but
Thames
water
to
drink
.
No
Falernian
*NL*
wine
here
,
no
going
ashore
.
Here
and
there
a
military
camp
lost
in
*NL*
a
wilderness
,
like
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
--
cold
,
fog
,
tempests
,
*NL*
disease
,
exile
,
and
death
--
death
skulking
in
the
air
,
in
the
water
,
in
*NL*
the
bush
.
They
must
have
been
dying
like
flies
here
.
Oh
,
yes
--
he
did
*NL*
it
.
Did
it
very
well
,
too
,
no
doubt
,
and
without
thinking
much
about
*NL*
it
either
,
except
afterwards
to
brag
of
what
he
had
gone
through
in
his
*NL*
time
,
perhaps
.
They
were
men
enough
to
face
the
darkness
.
And
perhaps
he
*NL*
was
cheered
by
keeping
his
eye
on
a
chance
of
promotion
to
the
fleet
at
*NL*
Ravenna
by
and
by
,
if
he
had
good
friends
in
Rome
and
survived
the
awful
*NL*
climate
.
Or
think
of
a
decent
young
citizen
in
a
toga
--
perhaps
too
*NL*
much
dice
,
you
know
--
coming
out
here
in
the
train
of
some
prefect
,
or
*NL*
tax-gatherer
,
or
trader
even
,
to
mend
his
fortunes
.
Land
in
a
swamp
,
*NL*
march
through
the
woods
,
and
in
some
inland
post
feel
the
savagery
,
the
*NL*
utter
savagery
,
had
closed
round
him
--
all
that
mysterious
life
of
the
*NL*
wilderness
that
stirs
in
the
forest
,
in
the
jungles
,
in
the
hearts
of
*NL*
wild
men
.
There
's
no
initiation
either
into
such
mysteries
.
He
has
to
*NL*
live
in
the
midst
of
the
incomprehensible
,
which
is
also
detestable
.
And
*NL*
it
has
a
fascination
,
too
,
that
goes
to
work
upon
him
.
The
fascination
*NL*
of
the
abomination
--
you
know
,
imagine
the
growing
regrets
,
the
longing
*NL*
to
escape
,
the
powerless
disgust
,
the
surrender
,
the
hate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
''
he
began
again
,
lifting
one
arm
from
the
elbow
,
the
palm
of
the
*NL*
hand
outwards
,
so
that
,
with
his
legs
folded
before
him
,
he
had
the
*NL*
pose
of
a
Buddha
preaching
in
European
clothes
and
without
a
*NL*
lotus-flower
--
``
Mind
,
none
of
us
would
feel
exactly
like
this
.
What
saves
*NL*
us
is
efficiency
--
the
devotion
to
efficiency
.
But
these
chaps
were
not
*NL*
much
account
,
really
.
They
were
no
colonists
;
their
administration
was
*NL*
merely
a
squeeze
,
and
nothing
more
,
I
suspect
.
They
were
conquerors
,
and
*NL*
for
that
you
want
only
brute
force
--
nothing
to
boast
of
,
when
you
have
*NL*
it
,
since
your
strength
is
just
an
accident
arising
from
the
weakness
of
*NL*
others
.
They
grabbed
what
they
could
get
for
the
sake
of
what
was
to
*NL*
be
got
.
It
was
just
robbery
with
violence
,
aggravated
murder
on
a
great
*NL*
scale
,
and
men
going
at
it
blind
--
as
is
very
proper
for
those
who
tackle
*NL*
a
darkness
.
The
conquest
of
the
earth
,
which
mostly
means
the
taking
*NL*
it
away
from
those
who
have
a
different
complexion
or
slightly
flatter
*NL*
noses
than
ourselves
,
is
not
a
pretty
thing
when
you
look
into
it
too
*NL*
much
.
What
redeems
it
is
the
idea
only
.
An
idea
at
the
back
of
it
;
not
*NL*
a
sentimental
pretence
but
an
idea
;
and
an
unselfish
belief
in
the
*NL*
idea
--
something
you
can
set
up
,
and
bow
down
before
,
and
offer
a
*NL*
sacrifice
to
...

He
broke
off
.
Flames
glided
in
the
river
,
small
green
flames
,
red
*NL*
flames
,
white
flames
,
pursuing
,
overtaking
,
joining
,
crossing
each
*NL*
other
--
then
separating
slowly
or
hastily
.
The
traffic
of
the
great
city
*NL*
went
on
in
the
deepening
night
upon
the
sleepless
river
.
We
looked
on
,
*NL*
waiting
patiently
--
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
till
the
end
of
*NL*
the
flood
;
but
it
was
only
after
a
long
silence
,
when
he
said
,
in
*NL*
a
hesitating
voice
,
``
I
suppose
you
fellows
remember
I
did
once
turn
*NL*
fresh-water
sailor
for
a
bit
,
''
that
we
knew
we
were
fated
,
before
*NL*
the
ebb
began
to
run
,
to
hear
about
one
of
Marlow
's
inconclusive
*NL*
experiences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
bother
you
much
with
what
happened
to
me
personally
,
''
*NL*
he
began
,
showing
in
this
remark
the
weakness
of
many
tellers
of
tales
*NL*
who
seem
so
often
unaware
of
what
their
audience
would
like
best
to
*NL*
hear
;
``
yet
to
understand
the
effect
of
it
on
me
you
ought
to
know
how
I
*NL*
got
out
there
,
what
I
saw
,
how
I
went
up
that
river
to
the
place
where
I
*NL*
first
met
the
poor
chap
.
It
was
the
farthest
point
of
navigation
and
the
*NL*
culminating
point
of
my
experience
.
It
seemed
somehow
to
throw
a
kind
*NL*
of
light
on
everything
about
me
--
and
into
my
thoughts
.
It
was
sombre
*NL*
enough
,
too
--
and
pitiful
--
not
extraordinary
in
any
way
--
not
very
clear
*NL*
either
.
No
,
not
very
clear
.
And
yet
it
seemed
to
throw
a
kind
of
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
then
,
as
you
remember
,
just
returned
to
London
after
a
lot
of
*NL*
Indian
Ocean
,
Pacific
,
China
Seas
--
a
regular
dose
of
the
East
--
six
years
*NL*
or
so
,
and
I
was
loafing
about
,
hindering
you
fellows
in
your
work
and
*NL*
invading
your
homes
,
just
as
though
I
had
got
a
heavenly
mission
to
*NL*
civilize
you
.
It
was
very
fine
for
a
time
,
but
after
a
bit
I
did
get
*NL*
tired
of
resting
.
Then
I
began
to
look
for
a
ship
--
I
should
think
the
*NL*
hardest
work
on
earth
.
But
the
ships
would
n't
even
look
at
me
.
And
I
got
*NL*
tired
of
that
game
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
when
I
was
a
little
chap
I
had
a
passion
for
maps
.
I
would
look
for
*NL*
hours
at
South
America
,
or
Africa
,
or
Australia
,
and
lose
myself
in
all
*NL*
the
glories
of
exploration
.
At
that
time
there
were
many
blank
spaces
on
*NL*
the
earth
,
and
when
I
saw
one
that
looked
particularly
inviting
on
a
map
*NL*
-LRB-
but
they
all
look
that
-RRB-
I
would
put
my
finger
on
it
and
say
,
`
When
*NL*
I
grow
up
I
will
go
there
.
'
The
North
Pole
was
one
of
these
places
,
I
*NL*
remember
.
Well
,
I
have
n't
been
there
yet
,
and
shall
not
try
now
.
The
*NL*
glamour
's
off
.
Other
places
were
scattered
about
the
hemispheres
.
I
*NL*
have
been
in
some
of
them
,
and
...
well
,
we
wo
n't
talk
about
that
.
But
*NL*
there
was
one
yet
--
the
biggest
,
the
most
blank
,
so
to
speak
--
that
I
had
*NL*
a
hankering
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
by
this
time
it
was
not
a
blank
space
any
more
.
It
had
got
filled
*NL*
since
my
boyhood
with
rivers
and
lakes
and
names
.
It
had
ceased
to
be
*NL*
a
blank
space
of
delightful
mystery
--
a
white
patch
for
a
boy
to
dream
*NL*
gloriously
over
.
It
had
become
a
place
of
darkness
.
But
there
was
in
it
*NL*
one
river
especially
,
a
mighty
big
river
,
that
you
could
see
on
the
map
,
*NL*
resembling
an
immense
snake
uncoiled
,
with
its
head
in
the
sea
,
its
*NL*
body
at
rest
curving
afar
over
a
vast
country
,
and
its
tail
lost
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
the
land
.
And
as
I
looked
at
the
map
of
it
in
a
shop-window
,
*NL*
it
fascinated
me
as
a
snake
would
a
bird
--
a
silly
little
bird
.
Then
I
*NL*
remembered
there
was
a
big
concern
,
a
Company
for
trade
on
that
river
.
*NL*
Dash
it
all
!
I
thought
to
myself
,
they
ca
n't
trade
without
using
some
*NL*
kind
of
craft
on
that
lot
of
fresh
water
--
steamboats
!
Why
should
n't
I
*NL*
try
to
get
charge
of
one
?
I
went
on
along
Fleet
Street
,
but
could
not
*NL*
shake
off
the
idea
.
The
snake
had
charmed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
it
was
a
Continental
concern
,
that
Trading
society
;
but
*NL*
I
have
a
lot
of
relations
living
on
the
Continent
,
because
it
's
cheap
*NL*
and
not
so
nasty
as
it
looks
,
they
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
own
I
began
to
worry
them
.
This
was
already
a
fresh
*NL*
departure
for
me
.
I
was
not
used
to
get
things
that
way
,
you
know
.
I
*NL*
always
went
my
own
road
and
on
my
own
legs
where
I
had
a
mind
to
go
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
have
believed
it
of
myself
;
but
,
then
--
you
see
--
I
felt
somehow
*NL*
I
must
get
there
by
hook
or
by
crook
.
So
I
worried
them
.
The
men
said
*NL*
`
My
dear
fellow
,
'
and
did
nothing
.
Then
--
would
you
believe
it
?
--
I
tried
*NL*
the
women
.
I
,
Charlie
Marlow
,
set
the
women
to
work
--
to
get
a
job
.
*NL*
Heavens
!
Well
,
you
see
,
the
notion
drove
me
.
I
had
an
aunt
,
a
dear
*NL*
enthusiastic
soul
.
She
wrote
:
`
It
will
be
delightful
.
I
am
ready
to
do
*NL*
anything
,
anything
for
you
.
It
is
a
glorious
idea
.
I
know
the
wife
of
a
*NL*
very
high
personage
in
the
Administration
,
and
also
a
man
who
has
lots
*NL*
of
influence
with
,
'
etc.
.
She
was
determined
to
make
no
end
of
fuss
to
*NL*
get
me
appointed
skipper
of
a
river
steamboat
,
if
such
was
my
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
my
appointment
--
of
course
;
and
I
got
it
very
quick
.
It
appears
*NL*
the
Company
had
received
news
that
one
of
their
captains
had
been
killed
*NL*
in
a
scuffle
with
the
natives
.
This
was
my
chance
,
and
it
made
me
the
*NL*
more
anxious
to
go
.
It
was
only
months
and
months
afterwards
,
when
I
*NL*
made
the
attempt
to
recover
what
was
left
of
the
body
,
that
I
heard
the
*NL*
original
quarrel
arose
from
a
misunderstanding
about
some
hens
.
Yes
,
*NL*
two
black
hens
.
Fresleven
--
that
was
the
fellow
's
name
,
a
Dane
--
thought
*NL*
himself
wronged
somehow
in
the
bargain
,
so
he
went
ashore
and
started
to
*NL*
hammer
the
chief
of
the
village
with
a
stick
.
Oh
,
it
did
n't
surprise
*NL*
me
in
the
least
to
hear
this
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
told
that
*NL*
Fresleven
was
the
gentlest
,
quietest
creature
that
ever
walked
on
two
*NL*
legs
.
No
doubt
he
was
;
but
he
had
been
a
couple
of
years
already
out
*NL*
there
engaged
in
the
noble
cause
,
you
know
,
and
he
probably
felt
the
*NL*
need
at
last
of
asserting
his
self-respect
in
some
way
.
Therefore
he
*NL*
whacked
the
old
nigger
mercilessly
,
while
a
big
crowd
of
his
people
*NL*
watched
him
,
thunderstruck
,
till
some
man
--
I
was
told
the
chief
's
*NL*
son
--
in
desperation
at
hearing
the
old
chap
yell
,
made
a
tentative
jab
*NL*
with
a
spear
at
the
white
man
--
and
of
course
it
went
quite
easy
between
*NL*
the
shoulder-blades
.
Then
the
whole
population
cleared
into
the
forest
,
*NL*
expecting
all
kinds
of
calamities
to
happen
,
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
the
steamer
Fresleven
commanded
left
also
in
a
bad
panic
,
in
charge
of
*NL*
the
engineer
,
I
believe
.
Afterwards
nobody
seemed
to
trouble
much
*NL*
about
Fresleven
's
remains
,
till
I
got
out
and
stepped
into
his
shoes
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
let
it
rest
,
though
;
but
when
an
opportunity
offered
at
last
to
*NL*
meet
my
predecessor
,
the
grass
growing
through
his
ribs
was
tall
enough
*NL*
to
hide
his
bones
.
They
were
all
there
.
The
supernatural
being
had
not
*NL*
been
touched
after
he
fell
.
And
the
village
was
deserted
,
the
huts
gaped
*NL*
black
,
rotting
,
all
askew
within
the
fallen
enclosures
.
A
calamity
*NL*
had
come
to
it
,
sure
enough
.
The
people
had
vanished
.
Mad
terror
had
*NL*
scattered
them
,
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
through
the
bush
,
and
they
had
*NL*
never
returned
.
What
became
of
the
hens
I
do
n't
know
either
.
I
should
*NL*
think
the
cause
of
progress
got
them
,
anyhow
.
However
,
through
this
*NL*
glorious
affair
I
got
my
appointment
,
before
I
had
fairly
begun
to
hope
*NL*
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
flew
around
like
mad
to
get
ready
,
and
before
forty-eight
hours
I
*NL*
was
crossing
the
Channel
to
show
myself
to
my
employers
,
and
sign
the
*NL*
contract
.
In
a
very
few
hours
I
arrived
in
a
city
that
always
makes
me
*NL*
think
of
a
whited
sepulchre
.
Prejudice
no
doubt
.
I
had
no
difficulty
in
*NL*
finding
the
Company
's
offices
.
It
was
the
biggest
thing
in
the
town
,
*NL*
and
everybody
I
met
was
full
of
it
.
They
were
going
to
run
an
over-sea
*NL*
empire
,
and
make
no
end
of
coin
by
trade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
narrow
and
deserted
street
in
deep
shadow
,
high
houses
,
innumerable
*NL*
windows
with
venetian
blinds
,
a
dead
silence
,
grass
sprouting
right
and
*NL*
left
,
immense
double
doors
standing
ponderously
ajar
.
I
slipped
through
*NL*
one
of
these
cracks
,
went
up
a
swept
and
ungarnished
staircase
,
as
arid
*NL*
as
a
desert
,
and
opened
the
first
door
I
came
to
.
Two
women
,
one
fat
and
*NL*
the
other
slim
,
sat
on
straw-bottomed
chairs
,
knitting
black
wool
.
The
*NL*
slim
one
got
up
and
walked
straight
at
me
--
still
knitting
with
downcast
*NL*
eyes
--
and
only
just
as
I
began
to
think
of
getting
out
of
her
way
,
as
*NL*
you
would
for
a
somnambulist
,
stood
still
,
and
looked
up
.
Her
dress
was
*NL*
as
plain
as
an
umbrella-cover
,
and
she
turned
round
without
a
word
and
*NL*
preceded
me
into
a
waiting-room
.
I
gave
my
name
,
and
looked
about
.
Deal
*NL*
table
in
the
middle
,
plain
chairs
all
round
the
walls
,
on
one
end
a
*NL*
large
shining
map
,
marked
with
all
the
colours
of
a
rainbow
.
There
was
a
*NL*
vast
amount
of
red
--
good
to
see
at
any
time
,
because
one
knows
that
some
*NL*
real
work
is
done
in
there
,
a
deuce
of
a
lot
of
blue
,
a
little
green
,
*NL*
smears
of
orange
,
and
,
on
the
East
Coast
,
a
purple
patch
,
to
show
where
*NL*
the
jolly
pioneers
of
progress
drink
the
jolly
lager-beer
.
However
,
I
*NL*
was
n't
going
into
any
of
these
.
I
was
going
into
the
yellow
.
Dead
in
*NL*
the
centre
.
And
the
river
was
there
--
fascinating
--
deadly
--
like
a
snake
.
*NL*
Ough
!
A
door
opened
,
a
white-haired
secretarial
head
,
but
wearing
a
*NL*
compassionate
expression
,
appeared
,
and
a
skinny
forefinger
beckoned
me
*NL*
into
the
sanctuary
.
Its
light
was
dim
,
and
a
heavy
writing-desk
squatted
*NL*
in
the
middle
.
From
behind
that
structure
came
out
an
impression
of
pale
*NL*
plumpness
in
a
frock-coat
.
The
great
man
himself
.
He
was
five
feet
*NL*
six
,
I
should
judge
,
and
had
his
grip
on
the
handle-end
of
ever
so
many
*NL*
millions
.
He
shook
hands
,
I
fancy
,
murmured
vaguely
,
was
satisfied
with
*NL*
my
French
.
_
Bon
Voyage

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
about
forty-five
seconds
I
found
myself
again
in
the
waiting-room
*NL*
with
the
compassionate
secretary
,
who
,
full
of
desolation
and
sympathy
,
*NL*
made
me
sign
some
document
.
I
believe
I
undertook
amongst
other
things
*NL*
not
to
disclose
any
trade
secrets
.
Well
,
I
am
not
going
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
began
to
feel
slightly
uneasy
.
You
know
I
am
not
used
to
such
*NL*
ceremonies
,
and
there
was
something
ominous
in
the
atmosphere
.
It
*NL*
was
just
as
though
I
had
been
let
into
some
conspiracy
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
--
something
not
quite
right
;
and
I
was
glad
to
get
out
.
In
the
outer
*NL*
room
the
two
women
knitted
black
wool
feverishly
.
People
were
arriving
,
*NL*
and
the
younger
one
was
walking
back
and
forth
introducing
them
.
The
*NL*
old
one
sat
on
her
chair
.
Her
flat
cloth
slippers
were
propped
up
on
*NL*
a
foot-warmer
,
and
a
cat
reposed
on
her
lap
.
She
wore
a
starched
*NL*
white
affair
on
her
head
,
had
a
wart
on
one
cheek
,
and
silver-rimmed
*NL*
spectacles
hung
on
the
tip
of
her
nose
.
She
glanced
at
me
above
the
*NL*
glasses
.
The
swift
and
indifferent
placidity
of
that
look
troubled
me
.
*NL*
Two
youths
with
foolish
and
cheery
countenances
were
being
piloted
over
,
*NL*
and
she
threw
at
them
the
same
quick
glance
of
unconcerned
wisdom
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
know
all
about
them
and
about
me
,
too
.
An
eerie
feeling
came
*NL*
over
me
.
She
seemed
uncanny
and
fateful
.
Often
far
away
there
I
thought
*NL*
of
these
two
,
guarding
the
door
of
Darkness
,
knitting
black
wool
as
for
*NL*
a
warm
pall
,
one
introducing
,
introducing
continuously
to
the
unknown
,
*NL*
the
other
scrutinizing
the
cheery
and
foolish
faces
with
unconcerned
old
*NL*
eyes
.

Not
*NL*
many
of
those
she
looked
at

her
again

by
a

way

There

formality
,
'
assured
me
*NL*
the
secretary
,
with
an
air
of
taking
an
immense
part
in
all
my
sorrows
.
*NL*
Accordingly
a
young
chap
wearing
his
hat
over
the
left
eyebrow
,
some
*NL*
clerk
I
suppose
--
there
must
have
been
clerks
in
the
business
,
though
*NL*
the
house
was
as
still
as
a
house
in
a
city
of
the
dead
--
came
from
*NL*
somewhere
up-stairs
,
and
led
me
forth
.
He
was
shabby
and
careless
,
with
*NL*
inkstains
on
the
sleeves
of
his
jacket
,
and
his
cravat
was
large
and
*NL*
billowy
,
under
a
chin
shaped
like
the
toe
of
an
old
boot
.
It
was
a
*NL*
little
too
early
for
the
doctor
,
so
I
proposed
a
drink
,
and
thereupon
he
*NL*
developed
a
vein
of
joviality
.
As
we
sat
over
our
vermouths
he
glorified
*NL*
the
Company
's
business
,
and
by
and
by
I
expressed
casually
my
surprise
*NL*
at
him
not
going
out
there
.
He
became
very
cool
and
collected
all
at
*NL*
once
.
'
I
am
not
such
a
fool
as
I
look
,
quoth
Plato
to
his
disciples
,
'
*NL*
he
said
sententiously
,
emptied
his
glass
with
great
resolution
,
and
we
*NL*
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
doctor
felt
my
pulse
,
evidently
thinking
of
something
else
*NL*
the
while
.
`
Good
,
good
for
there
,
'
he
mumbled
,
and
then
with
a
certain
*NL*
eagerness
asked
me
whether
I
would
let
him
measure
my
head
.
Rather
*NL*
surprised
,
I
said
Yes
,
when
he
produced
a
thing
like
calipers
and
got
*NL*
the
dimensions
back
and
front
and
every
way
,
taking
notes
carefully
.
He
*NL*
was
an
unshaven
little
man
in
a
threadbare
coat
like
a
gaberdine
,
with
*NL*
his
feet
in
slippers
,
and
I
thought
him
a
harmless
fool
.
'
I
always
ask
*NL*
leave
,
in
the
interests
of
science
,
to
measure
the
crania
of
those
going
*NL*
out
there
,
'
he
said
.
`
And
when
they
come
back
,
too
?
'
I
asked
.
`
Oh
,
I
*NL*
never
see
them
,
'
he
remarked
;
`
and
,
moreover
,
the
changes
take
place
*NL*
inside
,
you
know
.
'
He
smiled
,
as
if
at
some
quiet
joke
.
`
So
you
are
*NL*
going
out
there
.
Famous
.
Interesting
,
too
.
'
He
gave
me
a
searching
*NL*
glance
,
and
made
another
note
.
`
Ever
any
madness
in
your
family
?
'
he
*NL*
asked
,
in
a
matter-of-fact
tone
.
I
felt
very
annoyed
.
`
Is
that
question
*NL*
in
the
interests
of
science
,
too
?
'
`
It
would
be
,
'
he
said
,
without
*NL*
taking
notice
of
my
irritation
,
`
interesting
for
science
to
watch
the
*NL*
mental
changes
of
individuals
,
on
the
spot
,
but
...
'
`
Are
you
an
*NL*
alienist
?
'
I
interrupted
.
`
Every
doctor
should
be
--
a
little
,
'
answered
*NL*
that
original
,
imperturbably
.
'
I
have
a
little
theory
which
you
*NL*
messieurs
who
go
out
there
must
help
me
to
prove
.
This
is
my
share
*NL*
in
the
advantages
my
country
shall
reap
from
the
possession
of
such
a
*NL*
magnificent
dependency
.
The
mere
wealth
I
leave
to
others
.
Pardon
my
*NL*
questions
,
but
you
are
the
first
Englishman
coming
under
my
*NL*
observation
...
'
I
hastened
to
assure
him
I
was
not
in
the
least
typical
.
*NL*
`
If
I
were
,
'
said
I
,
'
I
would
n't
be
talking
like
this
with
you
.
'
`
What
*NL*
you
say
is
rather
profound
,
and
probably
erroneous
,
'
he
said
,
with
a
*NL*
laugh
.
`
Avoid
irritation
more
than
exposure
to
the
sun
.
_
Adieu
_
.
How
do
*NL*
you
English
say
,
eh
?
Good-bye
.
Ah
!
Good-bye
.
_
Adieu
_
.
In
the
tropics
one
*NL*
must
before
everything
keep
calm
.
'
...
He
lifted
a
warning
forefinger
...
*NL*
'
_
Du
calme
,
du
calme
_
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
more
remained
to
do
--
say
good-bye
to
my
excellent
aunt
.
I
*NL*
found
her
triumphant
.
I
had
a
cup
of
tea
--
the
last
decent
cup
of
tea
for
*NL*
many
days
--
and
in
a
room
that
most
soothingly
looked
just
as
you
would
*NL*
expect
a
lady
's
drawing-room
to
look
,
we
had
a
long
quiet
chat
by
the
*NL*
fireside
.
In
the
course
of
these
confidences
it
became
quite
plain
to
me
*NL*
I
had
been
represented
to
the
wife
of
the
high
dignitary
,
and
goodness
*NL*
knows
to
how
many
more
people
besides
,
as
an
exceptional
and
gifted
*NL*
creature
--
a
piece
of
good
fortune
for
the
Company
--
a
man
you
do
n't
get
*NL*
hold
of
every
day
.
Good
heavens
!
and
I
was
going
to
take
charge
of
a
*NL*
two-penny-half-penny
river-steamboat
with
a
penny
whistle
attached
!
It
*NL*
appeared
,
however
,
I
was
also
one
of
the
Workers
,
with
a
capital
--
you
*NL*
know
.
Something
like
an
emissary
of
light
,
something
like
a
lower
sort
*NL*
of
apostle
.
There
had
been
a
lot
of
such
rot
let
loose
in
print
and
talk
*NL*
just
about
that
time
,
and
the
excellent
woman
,
living
right
in
the
rush
*NL*
of
all
that
humbug
,
got
carried
off
her
feet
.
She
talked
about
`
weaning
*NL*
those
ignorant
millions
from
their
horrid
ways
,
'
till
,
upon
my
word
,
she
*NL*
made
me
quite
uncomfortable
.
I
ventured
to
hint
that
the
Company
was
run
*NL*
for
profit
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You
forget
,
dear
Charlie
,
that
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
,
'
*NL*
she
said
,
brightly
.
It
's
queer
how
out
of
touch
with
truth
women
are
.
*NL*
They
live
in
a
world
of
their
own
,
and
there
has
never
been
anything
*NL*
like
it
,
and
never
can
be
.
It
is
too
beautiful
altogether
,
and
if
they
*NL*
were
to
set
it
up
it
would
go
to
pieces
before
the
first
sunset
.
Some
*NL*
confounded
fact
we
men
have
been
living
contentedly
with
ever
since
the
*NL*
day
of
creation
would
start
up
and
knock
the
whole
thing
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
this
I
got
embraced
,
told
to
wear
flannel
,
be
sure
to
write
*NL*
often
,
and
so
on
--
and
I
left
.
In
the
street
--
I
do
n't
know
why
--
a
queer
*NL*
feeling
came
to
me
that
I
was
an
imposter
.
Odd
thing
that
I
,
who
used
to
*NL*
clear
out
for
any
part
of
the
world
at
twenty-four
hours
'
notice
,
with
*NL*
less
thought
than
most
men
give
to
the
crossing
of
a
street
,
had
a
*NL*
moment
--
I
wo
n't
say
of
hesitation
,
but
of
startled
pause
,
before
this
*NL*
commonplace
affair
.
The
best
way
I
can
explain
it
to
you
is
by
saying
*NL*
that
,
for
a
second
or
two
,
I
felt
as
though
,
instead
of
going
to
the
*NL*
centre
of
a
continent
,
I
were
about
to
set
off
for
the
centre
of
the
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
in
a
French
steamer
,
and
she
called
in
every
blamed
port
they
*NL*
have
out
there
,
for
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
the
sole
purpose
of
landing
*NL*
soldiers
and
custom-house
officers
.
I
watched
the
coast
.
Watching
a
*NL*
coast
as
it
slips
by
the
ship
is
like
thinking
about
an
enigma
.
There
*NL*
it
is
before
you
--
smiling
,
frowning
,
inviting
,
grand
,
mean
,
insipid
,
or
*NL*
savage
,
and
always
mute
with
an
air
of
whispering
,
`
Come
and
find
out
.
'
*NL*
This
one
was
almost
featureless
,
as
if
still
in
the
making
,
with
*NL*
an
aspect
of
monotonous
grimness
.
The
edge
of
a
colossal
jungle
,
so
*NL*
dark-green
as
to
be
almost
black
,
fringed
with
white
surf
,
ran
straight
,
*NL*
like
a
ruled
line
,
far
,
far
away
along
a
blue
sea
whose
glitter
was
*NL*
blurred
by
a
creeping
mist
.
The
sun
was
fierce
,
the
land
seemed
to
*NL*
glisten
and
drip
with
steam
.
Here
and
there
greyish-whitish
specks
*NL*
showed
up
clustered
inside
the
white
surf
,
with
a
flag
flying
above
*NL*
them
perhaps
.
Settlements
some
centuries
old
,
and
still
no
bigger
than
*NL*
pinheads
on
the
untouched
expanse
of
their
background
.
We
pounded
along
,
*NL*
stopped
,
landed
soldiers
;
went
on
,
landed
custom-house
clerks
to
levy
*NL*
toll
in
what
looked
like
a
God-forsaken
wilderness
,
with
a
tin
shed
*NL*
and
a
flag-pole
lost
in
it
;
landed
more
soldiers
--
to
take
care
of
the
*NL*
custom-house
clerks
,
presumably
.
Some
,
I
heard
,
got
drowned
in
the
surf
;
*NL*
but
whether
they
did
or
not
,
nobody
seemed
particularly
to
care
.
They
*NL*
were
just
flung
out
there
,
and
on
we
went
.
Every
day
the
coast
*NL*
looked
the
same
,
as
though
we
had
not
moved
;
but
we
passed
various
*NL*
places
--
trading
places
--
with
names
like
Gran
'
Bassam
,
Little
Popo
;
names
*NL*
that
seemed
to
belong
to
some
sordid
farce
acted
in
front
of
a
sinister
*NL*
back-cloth
.
The
idleness
of
a
passenger
,
my
isolation
amongst
all
these
*NL*
men
with
whom
I
had
no
point
of
contact
,
the
oily
and
languid
sea
,
the
*NL*
uniform
sombreness
of
the
coast
,
seemed
to
keep
me
away
from
the
truth
*NL*
of
things
,
within
the
toil
of
a
mournful
and
senseless
delusion
.
The
*NL*
voice
of
the
surf
heard
now
and
then
was
a
positive
pleasure
,
like
the
*NL*
speech
of
a
brother
.
It
was
something
natural
,
that
had
its
reason
,
that
*NL*
had
a
meaning
.
Now
and
then
a
boat
from
the
shore
gave
one
a
momentary
*NL*
contact
with
reality
.
It
was
paddled
by
black
fellows
.
You
could
see
*NL*
from
afar
the
white
of
their
eyeballs
glistening
.
They
shouted
,
sang
;
*NL*
their
bodies
streamed
with
perspiration
;
they
had
faces
like
grotesque
*NL*
masks
--
these
chaps
;
but
they
had
bone
,
muscle
,
a
wild
vitality
,
an
*NL*
intense
energy
of
movement
,
that
was
as
natural
and
true
as
the
surf
*NL*
along
their
coast
.
They
wanted
no
excuse
for
being
there
.
They
were
a
*NL*
great
comfort
to
look
at
.
For
a
time
I
would
feel
I
belonged
still
to
*NL*
a
world
of
straightforward
facts
;
but
the
feeling
would
not
last
long
.
*NL*
Something
would
turn
up
to
scare
it
away
.
Once
,
I
remember
,
we
came
upon
*NL*
a
man-of-war
anchored
off
the
coast
.
There
was
n't
even
a
shed
there
,
and
*NL*
she
was
shelling
the
bush
.
It
appears
the
French
had
one
of
their
wars
*NL*
going
on
thereabouts
.
Her
ensign
dropped
limp
like
a
rag
;
the
muzzles
*NL*
of
the
long
six-inch
guns
stuck
out
all
over
the
low
hull
;
the
greasy
,
*NL*
slimy
swell
swung
her
up
lazily
and
let
her
down
,
swaying
her
thin
*NL*
masts
.
In
the
empty
immensity
of
earth
,
sky
,
and
water
,
there
she
was
,
*NL*
incomprehensible
,
firing
into
a
continent
.
Pop
,
would
go
one
of
the
*NL*
six-inch
guns
;
a
small
flame
would
dart
and
vanish
,
a
little
white
smoke
*NL*
would
disappear
,
a
tiny
projectile
would
give
a
feeble
screech
--
and
*NL*
nothing
happened
.
Nothing
could
happen
.
There
was
a
touch
of
insanity
in
*NL*
the
proceeding
,
a
sense
of
lugubrious
drollery
in
the
sight
;
and
it
was
*NL*
not
dissipated
by
somebody
on
board
assuring
me
earnestly
there
was
*NL*
a
camp
of
natives
--
he
called
them
enemies
!
--
hidden
out
of
sight
*NL*
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
gave
her
her
letters
-LRB-
I
heard
the
men
in
that
lonely
ship
were
dying
*NL*
of
fever
at
the
rate
of
three
a
day
-RRB-
and
went
on
.
We
called
at
some
more
*NL*
places
with
farcical
names
,
where
the
merry
dance
of
death
and
trade
*NL*
goes
on
in
a
still
and
earthy
atmosphere
as
of
an
overheated
catacomb
;
*NL*
all
along
the
formless
coast
bordered
by
dangerous
surf
,
as
if
Nature
*NL*
herself
had
tried
to
ward
off
intruders
;
in
and
out
of
rivers
,
streams
*NL*
of
death
in
life
,
whose
banks
were
rotting
into
mud
,
whose
waters
,
*NL*
thickened
into
slime
,
invaded
the
contorted
mangroves
,
that
seemed
to
*NL*
writhe
at
us
in
the
extremity
of
an
impotent
despair
.
Nowhere
did
we
*NL*
stop
long
enough
to
get
a
particularized
impression
,
but
the
general
*NL*
sense
of
vague
and
oppressive
wonder
grew
upon
me
.
It
was
like
a
weary
*NL*
pilgrimage
amongst
hints
for
nightmares
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
upward
of
thirty
days
before
I
saw
the
mouth
of
the
big
river
.
*NL*
We
anchored
off
the
seat
of
the
government
.
But
my
work
would
not
begin
*NL*
till
some
two
hundred
miles
farther
on
.
So
as
soon
as
I
could
I
made
a
*NL*
start
for
a
place
thirty
miles
higher
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
my
passage
on
a
little
sea-going
steamer
.
Her
captain
was
a
*NL*
Swede
,
and
knowing
me
for
a
seaman
,
invited
me
on
the
bridge
.
He
was
a
*NL*
young
man
,
lean
,
fair
,
and
morose
,
with
lanky
hair
and
a
shuffling
gait
.
*NL*
As
we
left
the
miserable
little
wharf
,
he
tossed
his
head
contemptuously
*NL*
at
the
shore
.
`
Been
living
there
?
'
he
asked
.
I
said
,
`
Yes
.
'
`
Fine
lot
*NL*
these
government
chaps
--
are
they
not
?
'
he
went
on
,
speaking
English
*NL*
with
great
precision
and
considerable
bitterness
.
`
It
is
funny
what
some
*NL*
people
will
do
for
a
few
francs
a
month
.
I
wonder
what
becomes
of
that
*NL*
kind
when
it
goes
upcountry
?
'
I
said
to
him
I
expected
to
see
that
*NL*
soon
.
`
So-o-o
!
'
he
exclaimed
.
He
shuffled
athwart
,
keeping
one
eye
ahead
*NL*
vigilantly
.
`
Do
n't
be
too
sure
,
'
he
continued
.
`
The
other
day
I
took
*NL*
up
a
man
who
hanged
himself
on
the
road
.
He
was
a
Swede
,
too
.
'
*NL*
`
Hanged
himself
!
Why
,
in
God
's
name
?
'
I
cried
.
He
kept
on
looking
*NL*
out
watchfully
.
`
Who
knows
?
The
sun
too
much
for
him
,
or
the
country
*NL*
perhaps
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
we
opened
a
reach
.
A
rocky
cliff
appeared
,
mounds
of
turned-up
*NL*
earth
by
the
shore
,
houses
on
a
hill
,
others
with
iron
roofs
,
amongst
a
*NL*
waste
of
excavations
,
or
hanging
to
the
declivity
.
A
continuous
noise
of
*NL*
the
rapids
above
hovered
over
this
scene
of
inhabited
devastation
.
A
*NL*
lot
of
people
,
mostly
black
and
naked
,
moved
about
like
ants
.
A
jetty
*NL*
projected
into
the
river
.
A
blinding
sunlight
drowned
all
this
at
times
*NL*
in
a
sudden
recrudescence
of
glare
.
`
There
's
your
Company
's
station
,
'
*NL*
said
the
Swede
,
pointing
to
three
wooden
barrack-like
structures
on
the
*NL*
rocky
slope
.
'
I
will
send
your
things
up
.
Four
boxes
did
you
say
?
So
.
*NL*
Farewell
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
upon
a
boiler
wallowing
in
the
grass
,
then
found
a
path
*NL*
leading
up
the
hill
.
It
turned
aside
for
the
boulders
,
and
also
for
an
*NL*
undersized
railway-truck
lying
there
on
its
back
with
its
wheels
in
*NL*
the
air
.
One
was
off
.
The
thing
looked
as
dead
as
the
carcass
of
some
*NL*
animal
.
I
came
upon
more
pieces
of
decaying
machinery
,
a
stack
of
rusty
*NL*
rails
.
To
the
left
a
clump
of
trees
made
a
shady
spot
,
where
dark
things
*NL*
seemed
to
stir
feebly
.
I
blinked
,
the
path
was
steep
.
A
horn
tooted
to
*NL*
the
right
,
and
I
saw
the
black
people
run
.
A
heavy
and
dull
detonation
*NL*
shook
the
ground
,
a
puff
of
smoke
came
out
of
the
cliff
,
and
that
was
*NL*
all
.
No
change
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
rock
.
They
were
building
a
*NL*
railway
.
The
cliff
was
not
in
the
way
or
anything
;
but
this
objectless
*NL*
blasting
was
all
the
work
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
slight
clinking
behind
me
made
me
turn
my
head
.
Six
black
men
*NL*
advanced
in
a
file
,
toiling
up
the
path
.
They
walked
erect
and
slow
,
*NL*
balancing
small
baskets
full
of
earth
on
their
heads
,
and
the
clink
kept
*NL*
time
with
their
footsteps
.
Black
rags
were
wound
round
their
loins
,
and
*NL*
the
short
ends
behind
waggled
to
and
fro
like
tails
.
I
could
see
every
*NL*
rib
,
the
joints
of
their
limbs
were
like
knots
in
a
rope
;
each
had
an
*NL*
iron
collar
on
his
neck
,
and
all
were
connected
together
with
a
chain
*NL*
whose
bights
swung
between
them
,
rhythmically
clinking
.
Another
report
*NL*
from
the
cliff
made
me
think
suddenly
of
that
ship
of
war
I
had
seen
*NL*
firing
into
a
continent
.
It
was
the
same
kind
of
ominous
voice
;
but
*NL*
these
men
could
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
be
called
enemies
.
They
*NL*
were
called
criminals
,
and
the
outraged
law
,
like
the
bursting
shells
,
*NL*
had
come
to
them
,
an
insoluble
mystery
from
the
sea
.
All
their
meagre
*NL*
breasts
panted
together
,
the
violently
dilated
nostrils
quivered
,
the
*NL*
eyes
stared
stonily
uphill
.
They
passed
me
within
six
inches
,
without
a
*NL*
glance
,
with
that
complete
,
deathlike
indifference
of
unhappy
savages
.
*NL*
Behind
this
raw
matter
one
of
the
reclaimed
,
the
product
of
the
new
*NL*
forces
at
work
,
strolled
despondently
,
carrying
a
rifle
by
its
middle
.
*NL*
He
had
a
uniform
jacket
with
one
button
off
,
and
seeing
a
white
man
on
*NL*
the
path
,
hoisted
his
weapon
to
his
shoulder
with
alacrity
.
This
was
*NL*
simple
prudence
,
white
men
being
so
much
alike
at
a
distance
that
he
*NL*
could
not
tell
who
I
might
be
.
He
was
speedily
reassured
,
and
with
a
*NL*
large
,
white
,
rascally
grin
,
and
a
glance
at
his
charge
,
seemed
to
take
*NL*
me
into
partnership
in
his
exalted
trust
.
After
all
,
I
also
was
a
part
*NL*
of
the
great
cause
of
these
high
and
just
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Instead
of
going
up
,
I
turned
and
descended
to
the
left
.
My
idea
was
to
*NL*
let
that
chain-gang
get
out
of
sight
before
I
climbed
the
hill
.
You
know
*NL*
I
am
not
particularly
tender
;
I
've
had
to
strike
and
to
fend
off
.
*NL*
I
've
had
to
resist
and
to
attack
sometimes
--
that
's
only
one
way
of
*NL*
resisting
--
without
counting
the
exact
cost
,
according
to
the
demands
*NL*
of
such
sort
of
life
as
I
had
blundered
into
.
I
've
seen
the
devil
of
*NL*
violence
,
and
the
devil
of
greed
,
and
the
devil
of
hot
desire
;
but
,
by
*NL*
all
the
stars
!
these
were
strong
,
lusty
,
red-eyed
devils
,
that
swayed
*NL*
and
drove
men
--
men
,
I
tell
you
.
But
as
I
stood
on
this
hillside
,
I
*NL*
foresaw
that
in
the
blinding
sunshine
of
that
land
I
would
become
*NL*
acquainted
with
a
flabby
,
pretending
,
weak-eyed
devil
of
a
rapacious
and
*NL*
pitiless
folly
.
How
insidious
he
could
be
,
too
,
I
was
only
to
find
out
*NL*
several
months
later
and
a
thousand
miles
farther
.
For
a
moment
I
*NL*
stood
appalled
,
as
though
by
a
warning
.
Finally
I
descended
the
hill
,
*NL*
obliquely
,
towards
the
trees
I
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
avoided
a
vast
artificial
hole
somebody
had
been
digging
on
the
*NL*
slope
,
the
purpose
of
which
I
found
it
impossible
to
divine
.
It
was
n't
*NL*
a
quarry
or
a
sandpit
,
anyhow
.
It
was
just
a
hole
.
It
might
have
*NL*
been
connected
with
the
philanthropic
desire
of
giving
the
criminals
*NL*
something
to
do
.
I
do
n't
know
.
Then
I
nearly
fell
into
a
very
narrow
*NL*
ravine
,
almost
no
more
than
a
scar
in
the
hillside
.
I
discovered
that
*NL*
a
lot
of
imported
drainage-pipes
for
the
settlement
had
been
tumbled
in
*NL*
there
.
There
was
n't
one
that
was
not
broken
.
It
was
a
wanton
smash-up
.
*NL*
At
last
I
got
under
the
trees
.
My
purpose
was
to
stroll
into
the
shade
*NL*
for
a
moment
;
but
no
sooner
within
than
it
seemed
to
me
I
had
stepped
*NL*
into
the
gloomy
circle
of
some
Inferno
.
The
rapids
were
near
,
and
an
*NL*
uninterrupted
,
uniform
,
headlong
,
rushing
noise
filled
the
mournful
*NL*
stillness
of
the
grove
,
where
not
a
breath
stirred
,
not
a
leaf
moved
,
*NL*
with
a
mysterious
sound
--
as
though
the
tearing
pace
of
the
launched
*NL*
earth
had
suddenly
become
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Black
shapes
crouched
,
lay
,
sat
between
the
trees
leaning
against
the
*NL*
trunks
,
clinging
to
the
earth
,
half
coming
out
,
half
effaced
within
*NL*
the
dim
light
,
in
all
the
attitudes
of
pain
,
abandonment
,
and
despair
.
*NL*
Another
mine
on
the
cliff
went
off
,
followed
by
a
slight
shudder
of
the
*NL*
soil
under
my
feet
.
The
work
was
going
on
.
The
work
!
And
this
was
the
*NL*
place
where
some
of
the
helpers
had
withdrawn
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
dying
slowly
--
it
was
very
clear
.
They
were
not
enemies
,
they
*NL*
were
not
criminals
,
they
were
nothing
earthly
now
--
nothing
but
black
*NL*
shadows
of
disease
and
starvation
,
lying
confusedly
in
the
greenish
*NL*
gloom
.
Brought
from
all
the
recesses
of
the
coast
in
all
the
legality
*NL*
of
time
contracts
,
lost
in
uncongenial
surroundings
,
fed
on
unfamiliar
*NL*
food
,
they
sickened
,
became
inefficient
,
and
were
then
allowed
to
crawl
*NL*
away
and
rest
.
These
moribund
shapes
were
free
as
air
--
and
nearly
as
*NL*
thin
.
I
began
to
distinguish
the
gleam
of
the
eyes
under
the
trees
.
*NL*
Then
,
glancing
down
,
I
saw
a
face
near
my
hand
.
The
black
bones
reclined
*NL*
at
full
length
with
one
shoulder
against
the
tree
,
and
slowly
the
*NL*
eyelids
rose
and
the
sunken
eyes
looked
up
at
me
,
enormous
and
vacant
,
*NL*
a
kind
of
blind
,
white
flicker
in
the
depths
of
the
orbs
,
which
died
out
*NL*
slowly
.
The
man
seemed
young
--
almost
a
boy
--
but
you
know
with
them
it
's
*NL*
hard
to
tell
.
I
found
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
offer
him
one
of
my
good
*NL*
Swede
's
ship
's
biscuits
I
had
in
my
pocket
.
The
fingers
closed
slowly
*NL*
on
it
and
held
--
there
was
no
other
movement
and
no
other
glance
.
He
had
*NL*
tied
a
bit
of
white
worsted
round
his
neck
--
Why
?
Where
did
he
get
it
?
*NL*
Was
it
a
badge
--
an
ornament
--
a
charm
--
a
propitiatory
act
?
Was
there
any
*NL*
idea
at
all
connected
with
it
?
It
looked
startling
round
his
black
neck
,
*NL*
this
bit
of
white
thread
from
beyond
the
seas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Near
the
same
tree
two
more
bundles
of
acute
angles
sat
with
their
legs
*NL*
drawn
up
.
One
,
with
his
chin
propped
on
his
knees
,
stared
at
nothing
,
*NL*
in
an
intolerable
and
appalling
manner
:
his
brother
phantom
rested
its
*NL*
forehead
,
as
if
overcome
with
a
great
weariness
;
and
all
about
others
*NL*
were
scattered
in
every
pose
of
contorted
collapse
,
as
in
some
picture
*NL*
of
a
massacre
or
a
pestilence
.
While
I
stood
horror-struck
,
one
of
these
*NL*
creatures
rose
to
his
hands
and
knees
,
and
went
off
on
all-fours
towards
*NL*
the
river
to
drink
.
He
lapped
out
of
his
hand
,
then
sat
up
in
the
*NL*
sunlight
,
crossing
his
shins
in
front
of
him
,
and
after
a
time
let
his
*NL*
woolly
head
fall
on
his
breastbone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
want
any
more
loitering
in
the
shade
,
and
I
made
haste
towards
*NL*
the
station
.
When
near
the
buildings
I
met
a
white
man
,
in
such
an
*NL*
unexpected
elegance
of
get-up
that
in
the
first
moment
I
took
him
for
*NL*
a
sort
of
vision
.
I
saw
a
high
starched
collar
,
white
cuffs
,
a
light
*NL*
alpaca
jacket
,
snowy
trousers
,
a
clean
necktie
,
and
varnished
boots
.
No
*NL*
hat
.
Hair
parted
,
brushed
,
oiled
,
under
a
green-lined
parasol
held
in
a
*NL*
big
white
hand
.
He
was
amazing
,
and
had
a
penholder
behind
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shook
hands
with
this
miracle
,
and
I
learned
he
was
the
Company
's
*NL*
chief
accountant
,
and
that
all
the
book-keeping
was
done
at
this
*NL*
station
.
He
had
come
out
for
a
moment
,
he
said
,
`
to
get
a
breath
of
*NL*
fresh
air
.
The
expression
sounded
wonderfully
odd
,
with
its
suggestion
*NL*
of
sedentary
desk-life
.
I
would
n't
have
mentioned
the
fellow
to
you
at
*NL*
all
,
only
it
was
from
his
lips
that
I
first
heard
the
name
of
the
*NL*
man
who
is
so
indissolubly
connected
with
the
memories
of
that
time
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
I
respected
the
fellow
.
Yes
;
I
respected
his
collars
,
his
*NL*
vast
cuffs
,
his
brushed
hair
.
His
appearance
was
certainly
that
of
a
*NL*
hairdresser
's
dummy
;
but
in
the
great
demoralization
of
the
land
he
*NL*
kept
up
his
appearance
.
That
's
backbone
.
His
starched
collars
and
got-up
*NL*
shirt-fronts
were
achievements
of
character
.
He
had
been
out
nearly
*NL*
three
years
;
and
,
later
,
I
could
not
help
asking
him
how
he
managed
to
*NL*
sport
such
linen
.
He
had
just
the
faintest
blush
,
and
said
modestly
,
*NL*
`
I
've
been
teaching
one
of
the
native
women
about
the
station
.
It
was
*NL*
difficult
.
She
had
a
distaste
for
the
work
.
'
Thus
this
man
had
verily
*NL*
accomplished
something
.
And
he
was
devoted
to
his
books
,
which
were
in
*NL*
apple-pie
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
else
in
the
station
was
in
a
muddle
--
heads
,
things
,
*NL*
buildings
.
Strings
of
dusty
niggers
with
splay
feet
arrived
and
*NL*
departed
;
a
stream
of
manufactured
goods
,
rubbishy
cottons
,
beads
,
*NL*
and
brass-wire
sent
into
the
depths
of
darkness
,
and
in
return
came
a
*NL*
precious
trickle
of
ivory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
to
wait
in
the
station
for
ten
days
--
an
eternity
.
I
lived
in
a
*NL*
hut
in
the
yard
,
but
to
be
out
of
the
chaos
I
would
sometimes
get
into
*NL*
the
accountant
's
office
.
It
was
built
of
horizontal
planks
,
and
so
badly
*NL*
put
together
that
,
as
he
bent
over
his
high
desk
,
he
was
barred
from
*NL*
neck
to
heels
with
narrow
strips
of
sunlight
.
There
was
no
need
to
*NL*
open
the
big
shutter
to
see
.
It
was
hot
there
,
too
;
big
flies
buzzed
*NL*
fiendishly
,
and
did
not
sting
,
but
stabbed
.
I
sat
generally
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
while
,
of
faultless
appearance
-LRB-
and
even
slightly
scented
-RRB-
,
*NL*
perching
on
a
high
stool
,
he
wrote
,
he
wrote
.
Sometimes
he
stood
up
for
*NL*
exercise
.
When
a
truckle-bed
with
a
sick
man
-LRB-
some
invalid
agent
from
*NL*
upcountry
-RRB-
was
put
in
there
,
he
exhibited
a
gentle
annoyance
.
`
The
*NL*
groans
of
this
sick
person
,
'
he
said
,
`
distract
my
attention
.
And
*NL*
without
that
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
guard
against
clerical
errors
*NL*
in
this
climate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
he
remarked
,
without
lifting
his
head
,
`
In
the
interior
you
*NL*
will
no
doubt
meet
Mr.
Kurtz
.
'
On
my
asking
who
Mr.
Kurtz
was
,
he
*NL*
said
he
was
a
first-class
agent
;
and
seeing
my
disappointment
at
*NL*
this
information
,
he
added
slowly
,
laying
down
his
pen
,
`
He
is
a
very
*NL*
remarkable

'
Further
questions
elicited
from
him
that
Mr.
Kurtz
*NL*
was
at
present
in
charge
of
a
trading-post
,
a
very
important
one
,
in
the
*NL*
true
ivory-country
,
at
`
the
very
bottom
of
there
.
Sends
in
as
much
ivory
*NL*
as
all
the
others
put
together
...
'
He
began
to
write
again
.
The
sick
*NL*
man
was
too
ill
to
groan
.
The
flies
buzzed
in
a
great
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suddenly
there
was
a
growing
murmur
of
voices
and
a
great
tramping
of
*NL*
feet
.
A
caravan
had
come
in
.
A
violent
babble
of
uncouth
sounds
burst
*NL*
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
planks
.
All
the
carriers
were
speaking
*NL*
together
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
the
lamentable
voice
of
the
*NL*
chief
agent
was
heard
`
giving
it
up
'
tearfully
for
the
twentieth
time
*NL*
that
day
...
He
rose
slowly
.
`
What
a
frightful
row
,
'
he
said
.
He
*NL*
crossed
the
room
gently
to
look
at
the
sick
man
,
and
returning
,
said
to
*NL*
me
,
`
He
does
not
hear
.
'
`
What
!
Dead
?
'
I
asked
,
startled
.
`
No
,
not
yet
,
'
*NL*
he
answered
,
with
great
composure
.
Then
,
alluding
with
a
toss
of
the
*NL*
head
to
the
tumult
in
the
station-yard
,
`
When
one
has
got
to
make
*NL*
correct
entries
,
one
comes
to
hate
those
savages
--
hate
them
to
the
*NL*
death
.
'
He
remained
thoughtful
for
a
moment
.
`
When
you
see
Mr.
Kurtz
'
*NL*
he
went
on
,
`
tell
him
from
me
that
everything
here
'
--
he
glanced
at
the
*NL*
deck
--
'
is
very
satisfactory
.
I
do
n't
like
to
write
to
him
--
with
those
*NL*
messengers
of
ours
you
never
know
who
may
get
hold
of
your
letter
--
at
*NL*
that
Central
Station
.
'
He
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
with
his
mild
,
*NL*
bulging
eyes
.
`
Oh
,
he
will
go
far
,
very
far
,
'
he
began
again
.
`
He
*NL*
will
be
a
somebody
in
the
Administration
before
long
.
They
,
above
--
the
*NL*
Council
in
Europe
,
you
know
--
mean
him
to
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
turned
to
his
work
.
The
noise
outside
had
ceased
,
and
presently
*NL*
in
going
out
I
stopped
at
the
door
.
In
the
steady
buzz
of
flies
the
*NL*
homeward-bound
agent
was
lying
finished
and
insensible
;
the
other
,
*NL*
bent
over
his
books
,
was
making
correct
entries
of
perfectly
correct
*NL*
transactions
;
and
fifty
feet
below
the
doorstep
I
could
see
the
still
*NL*
tree-tops
of
the
grove
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
day
I
left
that
station
at
last
,
with
a
caravan
of
sixty
men
,
for
*NL*
a
two-hundred-mile
tramp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
use
telling
you
much
about
that
.
Paths
,
paths
,
everywhere
;
a
*NL*
stamped-in
network
of
paths
spreading
over
the
empty
land
,
through
the
*NL*
long
grass
,
through
burnt
grass
,
through
thickets
,
down
and
up
chilly
*NL*
ravines
,
up
and
down
stony
hills
ablaze
with
heat
;
and
a
solitude
,
a
*NL*
solitude
,
nobody
,
not
a
hut
.
The
population
had
cleared
out
a
long
*NL*
time
ago
.
Well
,
if
a
lot
of
mysterious
niggers
armed
with
all
kinds
of
*NL*
fearful
weapons
suddenly
took
to
travelling
on
the
road
between
Deal
and
*NL*
Gravesend
,
catching
the
yokels
right
and
left
to
carry
heavy
loads
for
*NL*
them
,
I
fancy
every
farm
and
cottage
thereabouts
would
get
empty
very
*NL*
soon
.
Only
here
the
dwellings
were
gone
,
too
.
Still
I
passed
through
*NL*
several
abandoned
villages
.
There
's
something
pathetically
childish
in
*NL*
the
ruins
of
grass
walls
.
Day
after
day
,
with
the
stamp
and
shuffle
of
*NL*
sixty
pair
of
bare
feet
behind
me
,
each
pair
under
a
60-lb
.
load
.
Camp
,
*NL*
cook
,
sleep
,
strike
camp
,
march

Now
and
then
a
carrier
dead
in
harness
,
*NL*
at
rest
in
the
long
grass
near
the
path
,
with
an
empty
water-gourd
and
*NL*
his
long
staff
lying
by
his
side
.
A
great
silence
around
and
above
.
*NL*
Perhaps
on
some
quiet
night
the
tremor
of
far-off
drums
,
sinking
,
*NL*
swelling
,
a
tremor
vast
,
faint
;
a
sound
weird
,
appealing
,
suggestive
,
*NL*
and
wild
--
and
perhaps
with
as
profound
a
meaning
as
the
sound
of
bells
*NL*
in
a
Christian
country
.
Once
a
white
man
in
an
unbuttoned
uniform
,
*NL*
camping
on
the
path
with
an
armed
escort
of
lank
Zanzibaris
,
very
*NL*
hospitable
and
festive
--
not
to
say
drunk
.
Was
looking
after
the
upkeep
*NL*
of
the
road
,
he
declared
.
Ca
n't
say
I
saw
any
road
or
any
upkeep
,
unless
*NL*
the
body
of
a
middle-aged
negro
,
with
a
bullet-hole
in
the
forehead
,
*NL*
upon
which
I
absolutely
stumbled
three
miles
farther
on
,
may
be
*NL*
considered
as
a
permanent
improvement
.
I
had
a
white
companion
,
too
,
*NL*
not
a
bad
chap
,
but
rather
too
fleshy
and
with
the
exasperating
habit
*NL*
of
fainting
on
the
hot
hillsides
,
miles
away
from
the
least
bit
of
shade
*NL*
and
water
.
Annoying
,
you
know
,
to
hold
your
own
coat
like
a
parasol
over
*NL*
a
man
's
head
while
he
is
coming
to
.
I
could
n't
help
asking
him
once
what
*NL*
he
meant
by
coming
there
at
all
.
`
To
make
money
,
of
course
.
What
do
you
*NL*
think
?
'
he
said
,
scornfully
.
Then
he
got
fever
,
and
had
to
be
carried
in
*NL*
a
hammock
slung
under
a
pole
.
As
he
weighed
sixteen
stone
I
had
no
end
*NL*
of
rows
with
the
carriers
.
They
jibbed
,
ran
away
,
sneaked
off
with
their
*NL*
loads
in
the
night
--
quite
a
mutiny
.
So
,
one
evening
,
I
made
a
speech
in
*NL*
English
with
gestures
,
not
one
of
which
was
lost
to
the
sixty
pairs
of
*NL*
eyes
before
me
,
and
the
next
morning
I
started
the
hammock
off
in
front
*NL*
all
right
.
An
hour
afterwards
I
came
upon
the
whole
concern
wrecked
in
*NL*
a
bush
--
man
,
hammock
,
groans
,
blankets
,
horrors
.
The
heavy
pole
had
*NL*
skinned
his
poor
nose
.
He
was
very
anxious
for
me
to
kill
somebody
,
*NL*
but
there
was
n't
the
shadow
of
a
carrier
near
.
I
remembered
the
old
*NL*
doctor
--
`
It
would
be
interesting
for
science
to
watch
the
mental
changes
*NL*
of
individuals
,
on
the
spot
.
'
I
felt
I
was
becoming
scientifically
*NL*
interesting
.
However
,
all
that
is
to
no
purpose
.
On
the
fifteenth
day
*NL*
I
came
in
sight
of
the
big
river
again
,
and
hobbled
into
the
Central
*NL*
Station
.
It
was
on
a
back
water
surrounded
by
scrub
and
forest
,
with
*NL*
a
pretty
border
of
smelly
mud
on
one
side
,
and
on
the
three
others
*NL*
enclosed
by
a
crazy
fence
of
rushes
.
A
neglected
gap
was
all
the
gate
*NL*
it
had
,
and
the
first
glance
at
the
place
was
enough
to
let
you
see
the
*NL*
flabby
devil
was
running
that
show
.
White
men
with
long
staves
in
their
*NL*
hands
appeared
languidly
from
amongst
the
buildings
,
strolling
up
to
*NL*
take
a
look
at
me
,
and
then
retired
out
of
sight
somewhere
.
One
of
them
,
*NL*
a
stout
,
excitable
chap
with
black
moustaches
,
informed
me
with
great
*NL*
volubility
and
many
digressions
,
as
soon
as
I
told
him
who
I
was
,
that
*NL*
my
steamer
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
.
I
was
thunderstruck
.
What
,
*NL*
how
,
why
?
Oh
,
it
was
`
all
right
.
'
The
`
manager
himself
'
was
there
.
All
*NL*
quite
correct
.
`
Everybody
had
behaved
splendidly
!
splendidly
!
'
--
`
you
*NL*
must
,
'
he
said
in
agitation
,
`
go
and
see
the
general
manager
at
once
.
He
*NL*
is
waiting
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
see
the
real
significance
of
that
wreck
at
once
.
I
fancy
I
*NL*
see
it
now
,
but
I
am
not
sure
--
not
at
all
.
Certainly
the
affair
was
too
*NL*
stupid
--
when
I
think
of
it
--
to
be
altogether
natural
.
Still
...
But
*NL*
at
the
moment
it
presented
itself
simply
as
a
confounded
nuisance
.
The
*NL*
steamer
was
sunk
.
They
had
started
two
days
before
in
a
sudden
hurry
*NL*
up
the
river
with
the
manager
on
board
,
in
charge
of
some
volunteer
*NL*
skipper
,
and
before
they
had
been
out
three
hours
they
tore
the
bottom
*NL*
out
of
her
on
stones
,
and
she
sank
near
the
south
bank
.
I
asked
myself
*NL*
what
I
was
to
do
there
,
now
my
boat
was
lost
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
I
had
*NL*
plenty
to
do
in
fishing
my
command
out
of
the
river
.
I
had
to
set
about
*NL*
it
the
very
next
day
.
That
,
and
the
repairs
when
I
brought
the
pieces
to
*NL*
the
station
,
took
some
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
first
interview
with
the
manager
was
curious
.
He
did
not
ask
me
to
*NL*
sit
down
after
my
twenty-mile
walk
that
morning
.
He
was
commonplace
in
*NL*
complexion
,
in
features
,
in
manners
,
and
in
voice
.
He
was
of
middle
*NL*
size
and
of
ordinary
build
.
His
eyes
,
of
the
usual
blue
,
were
perhaps
*NL*
remarkably
cold
,
and
he
certainly
could
make
his
glance
fall
on
one
as
*NL*
trenchant
and
heavy
as
an
axe
.
But
even
at
these
times
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
person
seemed
to
disclaim
the
intention
.
Otherwise
there
was
*NL*
only
an
indefinable
,
faint
expression
of
his
lips
,
something
*NL*
stealthy
--
a
smile
--
not
a
smile
--
I
remember
it
,
but
I
ca
n't
explain
.
It
*NL*
was
unconscious
,
this
smile
was
,
though
just
after
he
had
said
something
*NL*
it
got
intensified
for
an
instant
.
It
came
at
the
end
of
his
speeches
*NL*
like
a
seal
applied
on
the
words
to
make
the
meaning
of
the
commonest
*NL*
phrase
appear
absolutely
inscrutable
.
He
was
a
common
trader
,
from
his
*NL*
youth
up
employed
in
these
parts
--
nothing
more
.
He
was
obeyed
,
yet
he
*NL*
inspired
neither
love
nor
fear
,
nor
even
respect
.
He
inspired
*NL*
uneasiness
.
That
was
it
!
Uneasiness
.
Not
a
definite
mistrust
--
just
*NL*
uneasiness
--
nothing
more
.
You
have
no
idea
how
effective
such
a.
.
.
*NL*
a.
.
.
faculty
can
be
.
He
had
no
genius
for
organizing
,
for
initiative
,
*NL*
or
for
order
even
.
That
was
evident
in
such
things
as
the
deplorable
*NL*
state
of
the
station
.
He
had
no
learning
,
and
no
intelligence
.
His
*NL*
position
had
come
to
him
--
why
?
Perhaps
because
he
was
never
ill
...
He
*NL*
had
served
three
terms
of
three
years
out
there
...
Because
triumphant
*NL*
health
in
the
general
rout
of
constitutions
is
a
kind
of
power
*NL*
in
itself
.
When
he
went
home
on
leave
he
rioted
on
a
large
*NL*
scale
--
pompously
.
Jack
ashore
--
with
a
difference
--
in
externals
only
.
*NL*
This
one
could
gather
from
his
casual
talk
.
He
originated
nothing
,
he
*NL*
could
keep
the
routine
going
--
that
's
all
.
But
he
was
great
.
He
was
great
*NL*
by
this
little
thing
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
could
control
*NL*
such
a
man
.
He
never
gave
that
secret
away
.
Perhaps
there
was
nothing
*NL*
within
him
.
Such
a
suspicion
made
one
pause
--
for
out
there
there
were
no
*NL*
external
checks
.
Once
when
various
tropical
diseases
had
laid
low
almost
*NL*
every
`
agent
'
in
the
station
,
he
was
heard
to
say
,
`
Men
who
come
out
*NL*
here
should
have
no
entrails
.
'
He
sealed
the
utterance
with
that
smile
*NL*
of
his
,
as
though
it
had
been
a
door
opening
into
a
darkness
he
had
in
*NL*
his
keeping
.
You
fancied
you
had
seen
things
--
but
the
seal
was
on
.
When
*NL*
annoyed
at
meal-times
by
the
constant
quarrels
of
the
white
men
about
*NL*
precedence
,
he
ordered
an
immense
round
table
to
be
made
,
for
which
a
*NL*
special
house
had
to
be
built
.
This
was
the
station
's
mess-room
.
Where
*NL*
he
sat
was
the
first
place
--
the
rest
were
nowhere
.
One
felt
this
to
be
*NL*
his
unalterable
conviction
.
He
was
neither
civil
nor
uncivil
.
He
was
*NL*
quiet
.
He
allowed
his
`
boy
'
--
an
overfed
young
negro
from
the
coast
--
to
*NL*
treat
the
white
men
,
under
his
very
eyes
,
with
provoking
insolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
began
to
speak
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
.
I
had
been
very
long
on
the
*NL*
road
.
He
could
not
wait
.
Had
to
start
without
me
.
The
up-river
stations
*NL*
had
to
be
relieved
.
There
had
been
so
many
delays
already
that
he
did
*NL*
not
know
who
was
dead
and
who
was
alive
,
and
how
they
got
on
--
and
so
on
,
*NL*
and
so
on
.
He
paid
no
attention
to
my
explanations
,
and
,
playing
with
*NL*
a
stick
of
sealing-wax
,
repeated
several
times
that
the
situation
was
*NL*
`
very
grave
,
very
grave
.
'
There
were
rumours
that
a
very
important
*NL*
station
was
in
jeopardy
,
and
its
chief
,
Mr.
Kurtz
,
was
ill
.
Hoped
it
was
*NL*
not
true
.
Mr.
Kurtz
was
...
I
felt
weary
and
irritable
.
Hang
Kurtz
,
*NL*
I
thought
.
I
interrupted
him
by
saying
I
had
heard
of
Mr.
Kurtz
on
the
*NL*
coast
.
`
Ah
!
So
they
talk
of
him
down
there
,
'
he
murmured
to
himself
.
*NL*
Then
he
began
again
,
assuring
me
Mr.
Kurtz
was
the
best
agent
he
had
,
an
*NL*
exceptional
man
,
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
Company
;
therefore
*NL*
I
could
understand
his
anxiety
.
He
was
,
he
said
,
`
very
,
very
uneasy
.
'
*NL*
Certainly
he
fidgeted
on
his
chair
a
good
deal
,
exclaimed
,
`
Ah
,
Mr.
*NL*
Kurtz
!
'
broke
the
stick
of
sealing-wax
and
seemed
dumfounded
by
the
*NL*
accident
.
Next
thing
he
wanted
to
know
`
how
long
it
would
take
to
'
...
*NL*
I
interrupted
him
again
.
Being
hungry
,
you
know
,
and
kept
on
my
feet
*NL*
too
.
I
was
getting
savage
.
`
How
can
I
tell
?
'
I
said
.
'
I
have
n't
even
*NL*
seen
the
wreck
yet
--
some
months
,
no
doubt
.
'
All
this
talk
seemed
to
me
*NL*
so
futile
.
`
Some
months
,
'
he
said
.
`
Well
,
let
us
say
three
months
before
*NL*
we
can
make
a
start
.
Yes
.
That
ought
to
do
the
affair
.
'
I
flung
out
*NL*
of
his
hut
-LRB-
he
lived
all
alone
in
a
clay
hut
with
a
sort
of
verandah
-RRB-
*NL*
muttering
to
myself
my
opinion
of
him
.
He
was
a
chattering
idiot
.
*NL*
Afterwards
I
took
it
back
when
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
startlingly
*NL*
with
what
extreme
nicety
he
had
estimated
the
time
requisite
for
the
*NL*
`
affair
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
work
the
next
day
,
turning
,
so
to
speak
,
my
back
on
that
*NL*
station
.
In
that
way
only
it
seemed
to
me
I
could
keep
my
hold
on
the
*NL*
redeeming
facts
of
life
.
Still
,
one
must
look
about
sometimes
;
and
then
*NL*
I
saw
this
station
,
these
men
strolling
aimlessly
about
in
the
sunshine
*NL*
of
the
yard
.
I
asked
myself
sometimes
what
it
all
meant
.
They
wandered
*NL*
here
and
there
with
their
absurd
long
staves
in
their
hands
,
like
a
lot
*NL*
of
faithless
pilgrims
bewitched
inside
a
rotten
fence
.
The
word
`
ivory
'
*NL*
rang
in
the
air
,
was
whispered
,
was
sighed
.
You
would
think
they
were
*NL*
praying
to
it
.
A
taint
of
imbecile
rapacity
blew
through
it
all
,
like
a
*NL*
whiff
from
some
corpse
.
By
Jove
!
I
've
never
seen
anything
so
unreal
in
*NL*
my
life
.
And
outside
,
the
silent
wilderness
surrounding
this
cleared
*NL*
speck
on
the
earth
struck
me
as
something
great
and
invincible
,
like
*NL*
evil
or
truth
,
waiting
patiently
for
the
passing
away
of
this
fantastic
*NL*
invasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
these
months
!
Well
,
never
mind
.
Various
things
happened
.
One
*NL*
evening
a
grass
shed
full
of
calico
,
cotton
prints
,
beads
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
else
,
burst
into
a
blaze
so
suddenly
that
you
would
have
*NL*
thought
the
earth
had
opened
to
let
an
avenging
fire
consume
all
that
*NL*
trash
.
I
was
smoking
my
pipe
quietly
by
my
dismantled
steamer
,
and
saw
*NL*
them
all
cutting
capers
in
the
light
,
with
their
arms
lifted
high
,
when
*NL*
the
stout
man
with
moustaches
came
tearing
down
to
the
river
,
a
tin
*NL*
pail
in
his
hand
,
assured
me
that
everybody
was
`
behaving
splendidly
,
*NL*
splendidly
,
'
dipped
about
a
quart
of
water
and
tore
back
again
.
I
*NL*
noticed
there
was
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
his
pail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
strolled
up
.
There
was
no
hurry
.
You
see
the
thing
had
gone
off
like
*NL*
a
box
of
matches
.
It
had
been
hopeless
from
the
very
first
.
The
flame
*NL*
had
leaped
high
,
driven
everybody
back
,
lighted
up
everything
--
and
*NL*
collapsed
.
The
shed
was
already
a
heap
of
embers
glowing
fiercely
.
A
*NL*
nigger
was
being
beaten
near
by
.
They
said
he
had
caused
the
fire
in
*NL*
some
way
;
be
that
as
it
may
,
he
was
screeching
most
horribly
.
I
saw
him
,
*NL*
later
,
for
several
days
,
sitting
in
a
bit
of
shade
looking
very
sick
and
*NL*
trying
to
recover
himself
;
afterwards
he
arose
and
went
out
--
and
*NL*
the
wilderness
without
a
sound
took
him
into
its
bosom
again
.
As
I
*NL*
approached
the
glow
from
the
dark
I
found
myself
at
the
back
of
two
men
,
*NL*
talking
.
I
heard
the
name
of
Kurtz
pronounced
,
then
the
words
,
`
take
*NL*
advantage
of
this
unfortunate
accident
.
'
One
of
the
men
was
the
manager
.
*NL*
I
wished
him
a
good
evening
.
`
Did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
--
eh
?
it
*NL*
is
incredible
,
'
he
said
,
and
walked
off
.
The
other
man
remained
.
He
was
*NL*
a
first-class
agent
,
young
,
gentlemanly
,
a
bit
reserved
,
with
a
forked
*NL*
little
beard
and
a
hooked
nose
.
He
was
stand-offish
with
the
other
*NL*
agents
,
and
they
on
their
side
said
he
was
the
manager
's
spy
upon
them
.
*NL*
As
to
me
,
I
had
hardly
ever
spoken
to
him
before
.
We
got
into
talk
,
and
*NL*
by
and
by
we
strolled
away
from
the
hissing
ruins
.
Then
he
asked
me
to
*NL*
his
room
,
which
was
in
the
main
building
of
the
station
.
He
struck
*NL*
a
match
,
and
I
perceived
that
this
young
aristocrat
had
not
only
a
*NL*
silver-mounted
dressing-case
but
also
a
whole
candle
all
to
himself
.
*NL*
Just
at
that
time
the
manager
was
the
only
man
supposed
to
have
any
*NL*
right
to
candles
.
Native
mats
covered
the
clay
walls
;
a
collection
of
*NL*
spears
,
assegais
,
shields
,
knives
was
hung
up
in
trophies
.
The
business
*NL*
intrusted
to
this
fellow
was
the
making
of
bricks
--
so
I
had
been
*NL*
informed
;
but
there
was
n't
a
fragment
of
a
brick
anywhere
in
the
*NL*
station
,
and
he
had
been
there
more
than
a
year
--
waiting
.
It
seems
he
*NL*
could
not
make
bricks
without
something
,
I
do
n't
know
what
--
straw
maybe
.
*NL*
Anyway
,
it
could
not
be
found
there
and
as
it
was
not
likely
to
be
sent
*NL*
from
Europe
,
it
did
not
appear
clear
to
me
what
he
was
waiting
for
.
An
*NL*
act
of
special
creation
perhaps
.
However
,
they
were
all
waiting
--
all
*NL*
the
sixteen
or
twenty
pilgrims
of
them
--
for
something
;
and
upon
my
word
*NL*
it
did
not
seem
an
uncongenial
occupation
,
from
the
way
they
took
it
,
*NL*
though
the
only
thing
that
ever
came
to
them
was
disease
--
as
far
as
I
*NL*
could
see
.
They
beguiled
the
time
by
back-biting
and
intriguing
against
*NL*
each
other
in
a
foolish
kind
of
way
.
There
was
an
air
of
plotting
about
*NL*
that
station
,
but
nothing
came
of
it
,
of
course
.
It
was
as
unreal
as
*NL*
everything
else
--
as
the
philanthropic
pretence
of
the
whole
concern
,
as
*NL*
their
talk
,
as
their
government
,
as
their
show
of
work
.
The
only
real
*NL*
feeling
was
a
desire
to
get
appointed
to
a
trading-post
where
ivory
*NL*
was
to
be
had
,
so
that
they
could
earn
percentages
.
They
intrigued
*NL*
and
slandered
and
hated
each
other
only
on
that
account
--
but
as
to
*NL*
effectually
lifting
a
little
finger
--
oh
,
no
.
By
heavens
!
there
is
*NL*
something
after
all
in
the
world
allowing
one
man
to
steal
a
horse
while
*NL*
another
must
not
look
at
a
halter
.
Steal
a
horse
straight
out
.
Very
*NL*
well
.
He
has
done
it
.
Perhaps
he
can
ride
.
But
there
is
a
way
of
looking
*NL*
at
a
halter
that
would
provoke
the
most
charitable
of
saints
into
a
*NL*
kick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
no
idea
why
he
wanted
to
be
sociable
,
but
as
we
chatted
in
*NL*
there
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
the
fellow
was
trying
to
get
at
*NL*
something
--
in
fact
,
pumping
me
.
He
alluded
constantly
to
Europe
,
to
the
*NL*
people
I
was
supposed
to
know
there
--
putting
leading
questions
as
to
my
*NL*
acquaintances
in
the
sepulchral
city
,
and
so
on
.
His
little
eyes
*NL*
glittered
like
mica
discs
--
with
curiosity
--
though
he
tried
to
keep
up
a
*NL*
bit
of
superciliousness
.
At
first
I
was
astonished
,
but
very
soon
I
*NL*
became
awfully
curious
to
see
what
he
would
find
out
from
me
.
I
could
n't
*NL*
possibly
imagine
what
I
had
in
me
to
make
it
worth
his
while
.
It
was
*NL*
very
pretty
to
see
how
he
baffled
himself
,
for
in
truth
my
body
was
full
*NL*
only
of
chills
,
and
my
head
had
nothing
in
it
but
that
wretched
*NL*
steamboat
business
.
It
was
evident
he
took
me
for
a
perfectly
shameless
*NL*
prevaricator
.
At
last
he
got
angry
,
and
,
to
conceal
a
movement
of
*NL*
furious
annoyance
,
he
yawned
.
I
rose
.
Then
I
noticed
a
small
sketch
in
*NL*
oils
,
on
a
panel
,
representing
a
woman
,
draped
and
blindfolded
,
carrying
*NL*
a
lighted
torch
.
The
background
was
sombre
--
almost
black
.
The
movement
*NL*
of
the
woman
was
stately
,
and
the
effect
of
the
torchlight
on
the
face
*NL*
was
sinister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
arrested
me
,
and
he
stood
by
civilly
,
holding
an
empty
half-pint
*NL*
champagne
bottle
-LRB-
medical
comforts
-RRB-
with
the
candle
stuck
in
it
.
To
my
*NL*
question
he
said
Mr.
Kurtz
had
painted
this
--
in
this
very
station
more
*NL*
than
a
year
ago
--
while
waiting
for
means
to
go
to
his
trading
post
.
*NL*
`
Tell
me
,
pray
,
'
said
I
,
`
who
is
this
Mr.
Kurtz
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
chief
of
the
Inner
Station
,
'
he
answered
in
a
short
tone
,
looking
*NL*
away
.
`
Much
obliged
,
'
I
said
,
laughing
.
`
And
you
are
the
brickmaker
of
*NL*
the
Central
Station
.
Every
one
knows
that
.
'
He
was
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
`
He
is
a
prodigy
,
'
he
said
at
last
.
`
He
is
an
emissary
of
pity
and
*NL*
science
and
progress
,
and
devil
knows
what
else
.
We
want
,
'
he
began
*NL*
to
declaim
suddenly
,
`
for
the
guidance
of
the
cause
intrusted
to
us
by
*NL*
Europe
,
so
to
speak
,
higher
intelligence
,
wide
sympathies
,
a
singleness
*NL*
of
purpose
.
'
`
Who
says
that
?
'
I
asked
.
`
Lots
of
them
,
'
he
replied
.
`
Some
*NL*
even
write
that
;
and
so
_
he
_
comes
here
,
a
special
being
,
as
you
ought
to
*NL*
know
.
'
`
Why
ought
I
to
know
?
'
I
interrupted
,
really
surprised
.
He
paid
*NL*
no
attention
.
`
Yes
.
Today
he
is
chief
of
the
best
station
,
next
year
he
*NL*
will
be
assistant-manager
,
two
years
more
and
...
but
I
dare-say
you
*NL*
know
what
he
will
be
in
two
years
'
time
.
You
are
of
the
new
gang
--
the
*NL*
gang
of
virtue
.
The
same
people
who
sent
him
specially
also
recommended
*NL*
you
.
Oh
,
do
n't
say
no
.
I
've
my
own
eyes
to
trust
.
'
Light
dawned
upon
me
.
*NL*
My
dear
aunt
's
influential
acquaintances
were
producing
an
unexpected
*NL*
effect
upon
that
young
man
.
I
nearly
burst
into
a
laugh
.
`
Do
you
read
*NL*
the
Company
's
confidential
correspondence
?
'
I
asked
.
He
had
n't
a
word
*NL*
to
say
.
It
was
great
fun
.
`
When
Mr.
Kurtz
,
'
I
continued
,
severely
,
`
is
*NL*
General
Manager
,
you
wo
n't
have
the
opportunity
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
blew
the
candle
out
suddenly
,
and
we
went
outside
.
The
moon
had
*NL*
risen
.
Black
figures
strolled
about
listlessly
,
pouring
water
on
*NL*
the
glow
,
whence
proceeded
a
sound
of
hissing
;
steam
ascended
in
the
*NL*
moonlight
,
the
beaten
nigger
groaned
somewhere
.
`
What
a
row
the
brute
*NL*
makes
!
'
said
the
indefatigable
man
with
the
moustaches
,
appearing
*NL*
near
us
.
`
Serve
him
right
.
Transgression
--
punishment
--
bang
!
Pitiless
,
*NL*
pitiless
.
That
's
the
only
way
.
This
will
prevent
all
conflagrations
*NL*
for
the
future
.
I
was
just
telling
the
manager
...
'
He
noticed
my
*NL*
companion
,
and
became
crestfallen
all
at
once
.
`
Not
in
bed
yet
,
'
*NL*
he
said
,
with
a
kind
of
servile
heartiness
;
`
it
's
so
natural
.
Ha
!
*NL*
Danger
--
agitation
.
'
He
vanished
.
I
went
on
to
the
riverside
,
and
*NL*
the
other
followed
me
.
I
heard
a
scathing
murmur
at
my
ear
,
`
Heap
*NL*
of
muffs
--
go
to
.
'
The
pilgrims
could
be
seen
in
knots
gesticulating
,
*NL*
discussing
.
Several
had
still
their
staves
in
their
hands
.
I
verily
*NL*
believe
they
took
these
sticks
to
bed
with
them
.
Beyond
the
fence
the
*NL*
forest
stood
up
spectrally
in
the
moonlight
,
and
through
that
dim
stir
,
*NL*
through
the
faint
sounds
of
that
lamentable
courtyard
,
the
silence
of
*NL*
the
land
went
home
to
one
's
very
heart
--
its
mystery
,
its
greatness
,
the
*NL*
amazing
reality
of
its
concealed
life
.
The
hurt
nigger
moaned
feebly
*NL*
somewhere
near
by
,
and
then
fetched
a
deep
sigh
that
made
me
mend
my
*NL*
pace
away
from
there
.
I
felt
a
hand
introducing
itself
under
my
arm
.
*NL*
`
My
dear
sir
,
'
said
the
fellow
,
'
I
do
n't
want
to
be
misunderstood
,
and
*NL*
especially
by
you
,
who
will
see
Mr.
Kurtz
long
before
I
can
have
*NL*
that
pleasure
.
I
would
n't
like
him
to
get
a
false
idea
of
my
*NL*
disposition
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
let
him
run
on
,
this
_
papier-mache
_
Mephistopheles
,
and
it
seemed
to
me
*NL*
that
if
I
tried
I
could
poke
my
forefinger
through
him
,
and
would
find
*NL*
nothing
inside
but
a
little
loose
dirt
,
maybe
.
He
,
do
n't
you
see
,
had
*NL*
been
planning
to
be
assistant-manager
by
and
by
under
the
present
man
,
*NL*
and
I
could
see
that
the
coming
of
that
Kurtz
had
upset
them
both
not
a
*NL*
little
.
He
talked
precipitately
,
and
I
did
not
try
to
stop
him
.
I
had
my
*NL*
shoulders
against
the
wreck
of
my
steamer
,
hauled
up
on
the
slope
like
a
*NL*
carcass
of
some
big
river
animal
.
The
smell
of
mud
,
of
primeval
mud
,
*NL*
by
Jove
!
was
in
my
nostrils
,
the
high
stillness
of
primeval
forest
was
*NL*
before
my
eyes
;
there
were
shiny
patches
on
the
black
creek
.
The
moon
*NL*
had
spread
over
everything
a
thin
layer
of
silver
--
over
the
rank
grass
,
*NL*
over
the
mud
,
upon
the
wall
of
matted
vegetation
standing
higher
than
*NL*
the
wall
of
a
temple
,
over
the
great
river
I
could
see
through
a
sombre
*NL*
gap
glittering
,
glittering
,
as
it
flowed
broadly
by
without
a
murmur
.
*NL*
All
this
was
great
,
expectant
,
mute
,
while
the
man
jabbered
about
*NL*
himself
.
I
wondered
whether
the
stillness
on
the
face
of
the
immensity
*NL*
looking
at
us
two
were
meant
as
an
appeal
or
as
a
menace
.
What
were
we
*NL*
who
had
strayed
in
here
?
Could
we
handle
that
dumb
thing
,
or
would
it
*NL*
handle
us
?
I
felt
how
big
,
how
confoundedly
big
,
was
that
thing
that
*NL*
could
n't
talk
,
and
perhaps
was
deaf
as
well
.
What
was
in
there
?
I
could
*NL*
see
a
little
ivory
coming
out
from
there
,
and
I
had
heard
Mr.
Kurtz
was
*NL*
in
there
.
I
had
heard
enough
about
it
,
too
--
God
knows
!
Yet
somehow
*NL*
it
did
n't
bring
any
image
with
it
--
no
more
than
if
I
had
been
told
an
*NL*
angel
or
a
fiend
was
in
there
.
I
believed
it
in
the
same
way
one
of
you
*NL*
might
believe
there
are
inhabitants
in
the
planet
Mars
.
I
knew
once
a
*NL*
Scotch
sailmaker
who
was
certain
,
dead
sure
,
there
were
people
in
Mars
.
*NL*
If
you
asked
him
for
some
idea
how
they
looked
and
behaved
,
he
would
get
*NL*
shy
and
mutter
something
about
`
walking
on
all-fours
.
'
If
you
as
much
*NL*
as
smiled
,
he
would
--
though
a
man
of
sixty
--
offer
to
fight
you
.
I
would
*NL*
not
have
gone
so
far
as
to
fight
for
Kurtz
,
but
I
went
for
him
near
*NL*
enough
to
a
lie
.
You
know
I
hate
,
detest
,
and
ca
n't
bear
a
lie
,
not
*NL*
because
I
am
straighter
than
the
rest
of
us
,
but
simply
because
it
*NL*
appalls
me
.
There
is
a
taint
of
death
,
a
flavour
of
mortality
in
*NL*
lies
--
which
is
exactly
what
I
hate
and
detest
in
the
world
--
what
I
want
*NL*
to
forget
.
It
makes
me
miserable
and
sick
,
like
biting
something
rotten
*NL*
would
do
.
Temperament
,
I
suppose
.
Well
,
I
went
near
enough
to
it
by
*NL*
letting
the
young
fool
there
believe
anything
he
liked
to
imagine
as
to
*NL*
my
influence
in
Europe
.
I
became
in
an
instant
as
much
of
a
pretence
as
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
bewitched
pilgrims
.
This
simply
because
I
had
a
notion
*NL*
it
somehow
would
be
of
help
to
that
Kurtz
whom
at
the
time
I
did
not
*NL*
see
--
you
understand
.
He
was
just
a
word
for
me
.
I
did
not
see
the
man
in
*NL*
the
name
any
more
than
you
do
.
Do
you
see
him
?
Do
you
see
the
story
?
Do
*NL*
you
see
anything
?
It
seems
to
me
I
am
trying
to
tell
you
a
*NL*
dream
--
making
a
vain
attempt
,
because
no
relation
of
a
dream
can
convey
*NL*
the
dream-sensation
,
that
commingling
of
absurdity
,
surprise
,
and
*NL*
bewilderment
in
a
tremor
of
struggling
revolt
,
that
notion
of
being
*NL*
captured
by
the
incredible
which
is
of
the
very
essence
of
dreams
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
No
,
it
is
impossible
;
it
is
impossible
to
convey
the
*NL*
life-sensation
of
any
given
epoch
of
one
's
existence
--
that
which
makes
*NL*
its
truth
,
its
meaning
--
its
subtle
and
penetrating
essence
.
It
is
*NL*
impossible
.
We
live
,
as
we
dream
--
alone
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
again
as
if
reflecting
,
then
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
in
this
you
fellows
see
more
than
I
could
then
.
You
see
me
,
*NL*
whom
you
know
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
become
so
pitch
dark
that
we
listeners
could
hardly
see
one
*NL*
another
.
For
a
long
time
already
he
,
sitting
apart
,
had
been
no
more
*NL*
to
us
than
a
voice
.
There
was
not
a
word
from
anybody
.
The
others
might
*NL*
have
been
asleep
,
but
I
was
awake
.
I
listened
,
I
listened
on
the
watch
*NL*
for
the
sentence
,
for
the
word
,
that
would
give
me
the
clue
to
the
*NL*
faint
uneasiness
inspired
by
this
narrative
that
seemed
to
shape
itself
*NL*
without
human
lips
in
the
heavy
night-air
of
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
Yes
--
I
let
him
run
on
,
''
Marlow
began
again
,
``
and
think
what
*NL*
he
pleased
about
the
powers
that
were
behind
me
.
I
did
!
And
there
was
*NL*
nothing
behind
me
!
There
was
nothing
but
that
wretched
,
old
,
mangled
*NL*
steamboat
I
was
leaning
against
,
while
he
talked
fluently
about
`
the
*NL*
necessity
for
every
man
to
get
on
.
'
`
And
when
one
comes
out
here
,
you
*NL*
conceive
,
it
is
not
to
gaze
at
the
moon
.
'
Mr.
Kurtz
was
a
`
universal
*NL*
genius
,
'
but
even
a
genius
would
find
it
easier
to
work
with
`
adequate
*NL*
tools
--
intelligent
men
.
'
He
did
not
make
bricks
--
why
,
there
was
a
*NL*
physical
impossibility
in
the
way
--
as
I
was
well
aware
;
and
if
he
*NL*
did
secretarial
work
for
the
manager
,
it
was
because
`
no
sensible
man
*NL*
rejects
wantonly
the
confidence
of
his
superiors
.
'
Did
I
see
it
?
I
saw
*NL*
it
.
What
more
did
I
want
?
What
I
really
wanted
was
rivets
,
by
heaven
!
*NL*
Rivets
.
To
get
on
with
the
work
--
to
stop
the
hole
.
Rivets
I
*NL*
wanted
.
There
were
cases
of
them
down
at
the
coast
--
cases
--
piled
*NL*
up
--
burst
--
split
!
You
kicked
a
loose
rivet
at
every
second
step
in
that
*NL*
station-yard
on
the
hillside
.
Rivets
had
rolled
into
the
grove
of
death
.
*NL*
You
could
fill
your
pockets
with
rivets
for
the
trouble
of
stooping
*NL*
down
--
and
there
was
n't
one
rivet
to
be
found
where
it
was
wanted
.
We
*NL*
had
plates
that
would
do
,
but
nothing
to
fasten
them
with
.
And
every
*NL*
week
the
messenger
,
a
long
negro
,
letter-bag
on
shoulder
and
staff
in
*NL*
hand
,
left
our
station
for
the
coast
.
And
several
times
a
week
a
coast
*NL*
caravan
came
in
with
trade
goods
--
ghastly
glazed
calico
that
made
you
*NL*
shudder
only
to
look
at
it
,
glass
beads
value
about
a
penny
a
quart
,
*NL*
confounded
spotted
cotton
handkerchiefs
.
And
no
rivets
.
Three
carriers
*NL*
could
have
brought
all
that
was
wanted
to
set
that
steamboat
afloat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
becoming
confidential
now
,
but
I
fancy
my
unresponsive
attitude
*NL*
must
have
exasperated
him
at
last
,
for
he
judged
it
necessary
to
inform
*NL*
me
he
feared
neither
God
nor
devil
,
let
alone
any
mere
man
.
I
said
I
*NL*
could
see
that
very
well
,
but
what
I
wanted
was
a
certain
quantity
of
*NL*
rivets
--
and
rivets
were
what
really
Mr.
Kurtz
wanted
,
if
he
had
only
*NL*
known
it
.
Now
letters
went
to
the
coast
every
week
...
`
My
dear
*NL*
sir
,
'
he
cried
,
'
I
write
from
dictation
.
'
I
demanded
rivets
.
There
was
*NL*
a
way
--
for
an
intelligent
man
.
He
changed
his
manner
;
became
very
*NL*
cold
,
and
suddenly
began
to
talk
about
a
hippopotamus
;
wondered
whether
*NL*
sleeping
on
board
the
steamer
-LRB-
I
stuck
to
my
salvage
night
and
day
-RRB-
*NL*
I
was
n't
disturbed
.
There
was
an
old
hippo
that
had
the
bad
habit
of
*NL*
getting
out
on
the
bank
and
roaming
at
night
over
the
station
grounds
.
*NL*
The
pilgrims
used
to
turn
out
in
a
body
and
empty
every
rifle
they
could
*NL*
lay
hands
on
at
him
.
Some
even
had
sat
up
o
'
nights
for
him
.
All
this
*NL*
energy
was
wasted
,
though
.
`
That
animal
has
a
charmed
life
,
'
he
said
;
*NL*
`
but
you
can
say
this
only
of
brutes
in
this
country
.
No
man
--
you
*NL*
apprehend
me
?
--
no
man
here
bears
a
charmed
life
.
'
He
stood
there
for
*NL*
a
moment
in
the
moonlight
with
his
delicate
hooked
nose
set
a
little
*NL*
askew
,
and
his
mica
eyes
glittering
without
a
wink
,
then
,
with
a
curt
*NL*
Good-night
,
he
strode
off
.
I
could
see
he
was
disturbed
and
considerably
*NL*
puzzled
,
which
made
me
feel
more
hopeful
than
I
had
been
for
days
.
It
*NL*
was
a
great
comfort
to
turn
from
that
chap
to
my
influential
friend
,
the
*NL*
battered
,
twisted
,
ruined
,
tin-pot
steamboat
.
I
clambered
on
board
.
She
*NL*
rang
under
my
feet
like
an
empty
Huntley
&
Palmer
biscuit-tin
kicked
*NL*
along
a
gutter
;
she
was
nothing
so
solid
in
make
,
and
rather
less
pretty
*NL*
in
shape
,
but
I
had
expended
enough
hard
work
on
her
to
make
me
love
*NL*
her
.
No
influential
friend
would
have
served
me
better
.
She
had
given
*NL*
me
a
chance
to
come
out
a
bit
--
to
find
out
what
I
could
do
.
No
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
work
.
I
had
rather
laze
about
and
think
of
all
the
fine
things
that
*NL*
can
be
done
.
I
do
n't
like
work
--
no
man
does
--
but
I
like
what
is
in
the
*NL*
work
--
the
chance
to
find
yourself
.
Your
own
reality
--
for
yourself
,
not
*NL*
for
others
--
what
no
other
man
can
ever
know
.
They
can
only
see
the
mere
*NL*
show
,
and
never
can
tell
what
it
really
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
surprised
to
see
somebody
sitting
aft
,
on
the
deck
,
with
*NL*
his
legs
dangling
over
the
mud
.
You
see
I
rather
chummed
with
the
few
*NL*
mechanics
there
were
in
that
station
,
whom
the
other
pilgrims
naturally
*NL*
despised
--
on
account
of
their
imperfect
manners
,
I
suppose
.
This
was
the
*NL*
foreman
--
a
boiler-maker
by
trade
--
a
good
worker
.
He
was
a
lank
,
bony
,
*NL*
yellow-faced
man
,
with
big
intense
eyes
.
His
aspect
was
worried
,
and
his
*NL*
head
was
as
bald
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
;
but
his
hair
in
falling
seemed
*NL*
to
have
stuck
to
his
chin
,
and
had
prospered
in
the
new
locality
,
*NL*
for
his
beard
hung
down
to
his
waist
.
He
was
a
widower
with
six
young
*NL*
children
-LRB-
he
had
left
them
in
charge
of
a
sister
of
his
to
come
out
*NL*
there
-RRB-
,
and
the
passion
of
his
life
was
pigeon-flying
.
He
was
an
*NL*
enthusiast
and
a
connoisseur
.
He
would
rave
about
pigeons
.
After
work
*NL*
hours
he
used
sometimes
to
come
over
from
his
hut
for
a
talk
about
his
*NL*
children
and
his
pigeons
;
at
work
,
when
he
had
to
crawl
in
the
mud
under
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
steamboat
,
he
would
tie
up
that
beard
of
his
in
a
kind
*NL*
of
white
serviette
he
brought
for
the
purpose
.
It
had
loops
to
go
over
*NL*
his
ears
.
In
the
evening
he
could
be
seen
squatted
on
the
bank
rinsing
*NL*
that
wrapper
in
the
creek
with
great
care
,
then
spreading
it
solemnly
on
*NL*
a
bush
to
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
shouted
,
`
We
shall
have
rivets
!
'
He
*NL*
scrambled
to
his
feet
exclaiming
,
`
No
!
Rivets
!
'
as
though
he
could
n't
*NL*
believe
his
ears
.
Then
in
a
low
voice
,
`
You
...
eh
?
'
I
do
n't
know
why
*NL*
we
behaved
like
lunatics
.
I
put
my
finger
to
the
side
of
my
nose
and
*NL*
nodded
mysteriously
.
`
Good
for
you
!
'
he
cried
,
snapped
his
fingers
above
*NL*
his
head
,
lifting
one
foot
.
I
tried
a
jig
.
We
capered
on
the
iron
deck
.
*NL*
A
frightful
clatter
came
out
of
that
hulk
,
and
the
virgin
forest
on
*NL*
the
other
bank
of
the
creek
sent
it
back
in
a
thundering
roll
upon
the
*NL*
sleeping
station
.
It
must
have
made
some
of
the
pilgrims
sit
up
in
their
*NL*
hovels
.
A
dark
figure
obscured
the
lighted
doorway
of
the
manager
's
hut
,
*NL*
vanished
,
then
,
a
second
or
so
after
,
the
doorway
itself
vanished
,
too
.
*NL*
We
stopped
,
and
the
silence
driven
away
by
the
stamping
of
our
feet
*NL*
flowed
back
again
from
the
recesses
of
the
land
.
The
great
wall
of
*NL*
vegetation
,
an
exuberant
and
entangled
mass
of
trunks
,
branches
,
leaves
,
*NL*
boughs
,
festoons
,
motionless
in
the
moonlight
,
was
like
a
rioting
*NL*
invasion
of
soundless
life
,
a
rolling
wave
of
plants
,
piled
up
,
crested
,
*NL*
ready
to
topple
over
the
creek
,
to
sweep
every
little
man
of
us
out
*NL*
of
his
little
existence
.
And
it
moved
not
.
A
deadened
burst
of
mighty
*NL*
splashes
and
snorts
reached
us
from
afar
,
as
though
an
icthyosaurus
had
*NL*
been
taking
a
bath
of
glitter
in
the
great
river
.
`
After
all
,
'
said
the
*NL*
boiler-maker
in
a
reasonable
tone
,
`
why
should
n't
we
get
the
rivets
?
'
*NL*
Why
not
,
indeed
!
I
did
not
know
of
any
reason
why
we
should
n't
.
`
They
'll
*NL*
come
in
three
weeks
,
'
I
said
confidently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
did
n't
.
Instead
of
rivets
there
came
an
invasion
,
an
*NL*
infliction
,
a
visitation
.
It
came
in
sections
during
the
next
three
*NL*
weeks
,
each
section
headed
by
a
donkey
carrying
a
white
man
in
new
*NL*
clothes
and
tan
shoes
,
bowing
from
that
elevation
right
and
left
to
the
*NL*
impressed
pilgrims
.
A
quarrelsome
band
of
footsore
sulky
niggers
trod
on
*NL*
the
heels
of
the
donkey
;
a
lot
of
tents
,
camp-stools
,
tin
boxes
,
white
*NL*
cases
,
brown
bales
would
be
shot
down
in
the
courtyard
,
and
the
air
of
*NL*
mystery
would
deepen
a
little
over
the
muddle
of
the
station
.
Five
such
*NL*
instalments
came
,
with
their
absurd
air
of
disorderly
flight
with
the
*NL*
loot
of
innumerable
outfit
shops
and
provision
stores
,
that
,
one
*NL*
would
think
,
they
were
lugging
,
after
a
raid
,
into
the
wilderness
for
*NL*
equitable
division
.
It
was
an
inextricable
mess
of
things
decent
in
*NL*
themselves
but
that
human
folly
made
look
like
the
spoils
of
thieving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
devoted
band
called
itself
the
Eldorado
Exploring
Expedition
,
and
*NL*
I
believe
they
were
sworn
to
secrecy
.
Their
talk
,
however
,
was
the
talk
*NL*
of
sordid
buccaneers
:
it
was
reckless
without
hardihood
,
greedy
without
*NL*
audacity
,
and
cruel
without
courage
;
there
was
not
an
atom
of
foresight
*NL*
or
of
serious
intention
in
the
whole
batch
of
them
,
and
they
did
not
*NL*
seem
aware
these
things
are
wanted
for
the
work
of
the
world
.
To
tear
*NL*
treasure
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
land
was
their
desire
,
with
no
more
*NL*
moral
purpose
at
the
back
of
it
than
there
is
in
burglars
breaking
into
*NL*
a
safe
.
Who
paid
the
expenses
of
the
noble
enterprise
I
do
n't
know
;
but
*NL*
the
uncle
of
our
manager
was
leader
of
that
lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
exterior
he
resembled
a
butcher
in
a
poor
neighbourhood
,
and
his
*NL*
eyes
had
a
look
of
sleepy
cunning
.
He
carried
his
fat
paunch
with
*NL*
ostentation
on
his
short
legs
,
and
during
the
time
his
gang
infested
the
*NL*
station
spoke
to
no
one
but
his
nephew
.
You
could
see
these
two
roaming
*NL*
about
all
day
long
with
their
heads
close
together
in
an
everlasting
*NL*
confab
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
given
up
worrying
myself
about
the
rivets
.
One
's
capacity
for
*NL*
that
kind
of
folly
is
more
limited
than
you
would
suppose
.
I
said
*NL*
Hang
!
--
and
let
things
slide
.
I
had
plenty
of
time
for
meditation
,
*NL*
and
now
and
then
I
would
give
some
thought
to
Kurtz
.
I
was
n't
very
*NL*
interested
in
him
.
No
.
Still
,
I
was
curious
to
see
whether
this
man
,
who
*NL*
had
come
out
equipped
with
moral
ideas
of
some
sort
,
would
climb
to
the
*NL*
top
after
all
and
how
he
would
set
about
his
work
when
there
.

*NL*
``
One
evening
as
I
was
lying
flat
on
the
deck
of
my
steamboat
,
I
heard
*NL*
voices
approaching
--
and
there
were
the
nephew
and
the
uncle
strolling
*NL*
along
the
bank
.
I
laid
my
head
on
my
arm
again
,
and
had
nearly
lost
*NL*
myself
in
a
doze
,
when
somebody
said
in
my
ear
,
as
it
were
:
'
I
am
as
*NL*
harmless
as
a
little
child
,
but
I
do
n't
like
to
be
dictated
to
.
Am
I
the
*NL*
manager
--
or
am
I
not
?
I
was
ordered
to
send
him
there
.
It
's
incredible
.
'
*NL*
...
I
became
aware
that
the
two
were
standing
on
the
shore
alongside
*NL*
the
forepart
of
the
steamboat
,
just
below
my
head
.
I
did
not
move
;
it
*NL*
did
not
occur
to
me
to
move
:
I
was
sleepy
.
`
It
_
is
_
unpleasant
,
'
grunted
*NL*
the
uncle
.
`
He
has
asked
the
Administration
to
be
sent
there
,
'
said
the
*NL*
other
,
`
with
the
idea
of
showing
what
he
could
do
;
and
I
was
instructed
*NL*
accordingly
.
Look
at
the
influence
that
man
must
have
.
Is
it
not
*NL*
frightful
?
'
They
both
agreed
it
was
frightful
,
then
made
several
bizarre
*NL*
remarks
:
`
Make
rain
and
fine
weather
--
one
man
--
the
Council
--
by
the
*NL*
nose
'
--
bits
of
absurd
sentences
that
got
the
better
of
my
drowsiness
,
*NL*
so
that
I
had
pretty
near
the
whole
of
my
wits
about
me
when
the
uncle
*NL*
said
,
`
The
climate
may
do
away
with
this
difficulty
for
you
.
Is
he
alone
*NL*
there
?
'
`
Yes
,
'
answered
the
manager
;
`
he
sent
his
assistant
down
the
*NL*
river
with
a
note
to
me
in
these
terms
:
``
Clear
this
poor
devil
out
of
*NL*
the
country
,
and
do
n't
bother
sending
more
of
that
sort
.
I
had
rather
be
*NL*
alone
than
have
the
kind
of
men
you
can
dispose
of
with
me
.
''
It
was
more
*NL*
than
a
year
ago
.
Can
you
imagine
such
impudence
!
'
`
Anything
since
then
?
'
*NL*
asked
the
other
hoarsely
.
`
Ivory
,
'
jerked
the
nephew
;
`
lots
of
it
--
prime
*NL*
sort
--
lots
--
most
annoying
,
from
him
.
'
`
And
with
that
?
'
questioned
the
*NL*
heavy
rumble
.
`
Invoice
,
'
was
the
reply
fired
out
,
so
to
speak
.
Then
*NL*
silence
.
They
had
been
talking
about
Kurtz
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
broad
awake
by
this
time
,
but
,
lying
perfectly
at
ease
,
remained
*NL*
still
,
having
no
inducement
to
change
my
position
.
`
How
did
that
ivory
*NL*
come
all
this
way
?
'
growled
the
elder
man
,
who
seemed
very
vexed
.
The
*NL*
other
explained
that
it
had
come
with
a
fleet
of
canoes
in
charge
of
an
*NL*
English
half-caste
clerk
Kurtz
had
with
him
;
that
Kurtz
had
apparently
*NL*
intended
to
return
himself
,
the
station
being
by
that
time
bare
of
goods
*NL*
and
stores
,
but
after
coming
three
hundred
miles
,
had
suddenly
decided
*NL*
to
go
back
,
which
he
started
to
do
alone
in
a
small
dugout
with
four
*NL*
paddlers
,
leaving
the
half-caste
to
continue
down
the
river
with
the
*NL*
ivory
.
The
two
fellows
there
seemed
astounded
at
anybody
attempting
such
*NL*
a
thing
.
They
were
at
a
loss
for
an
adequate
motive
.
As
to
me
,
I
seemed
*NL*
to
see
Kurtz
for
the
first
time
.
It
was
a
distinct
glimpse
:
the
dugout
,
*NL*
four
paddling
savages
,
and
the
lone
white
man
turning
his
back
suddenly
*NL*
on
the
headquarters
,
on
relief
,
on
thoughts
of
home
--
perhaps
;
setting
*NL*
his
face
towards
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
,
towards
his
empty
and
*NL*
desolate
station
.
I
did
not
know
the
motive
.
Perhaps
he
was
just
simply
*NL*
a
fine
fellow
who
stuck
to
his
work
for
its
own
sake
.
His
name
,
you
*NL*
understand
,
had
not
been
pronounced
once
.
He
was
`
that
man
.
'
The
*NL*
half-caste
,
who
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
had
conducted
a
difficult
*NL*
trip
with
great
prudence
and
pluck
,
was
invariably
alluded
to
as
`
that
*NL*
scoundrel
.
'
The
`
scoundrel
'
had
reported
that
the
`
man
'
had
been
very
*NL*
ill
--
had
recovered
imperfectly
...
The
two
below
me
moved
away
then
a
*NL*
few
paces
,
and
strolled
back
and
forth
at
some
little
distance
.
I
heard
:
*NL*
`
Military
post
--
doctor
--
two
hundred
miles
--
quite
alone
now
--
unavoidable
*NL*
delays
--
nine
months
--
no
news
--
strange
rumours
.
'
They
approached
again
,
*NL*
just
as
the
manager
was
saying
,
`
No
one
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
unless
a
*NL*
species
of
wandering
trader
--
a
pestilential
fellow
,
snapping
ivory
*NL*
from
the
natives
.
'
Who
was
it
they
were
talking
about
now
?
I
gathered
in
*NL*
snatches
that
this
was
some
man
supposed
to
be
in
Kurtz
's
district
,
and
*NL*
of
whom
the
manager
did
not
approve
.
`
We
will
not
be
free
from
unfair
*NL*
competition
till
one
of
these
fellows
is
hanged
for
an
example
,
'
*NL*
he
said
.
`
Certainly
,
'
grunted
the
other
;
`
get
him
hanged
!
Why
not
?
*NL*
Anything
--
anything
can
be
done
in
this
country
.
That
's
what
I
say
;
*NL*
nobody
here
,
you
understand
,
_
here
_
,
can
endanger
your
position
.
And
why
?
*NL*
You
stand
the
climate
--
you
outlast
them
all
.
The
danger
is
in
Europe
;
*NL*
but
there
before
I
left
I
took
care
to
--
'
They
moved
off
and
whispered
,
*NL*
then
their
voices
rose
again
.
`
The
extraordinary
series
of
delays
is
*NL*
not
my
fault
.
I
did
my
best
.
'
The
fat
man
sighed
.
`
Very
sad
.
'
`
And
the
*NL*
pestiferous
absurdity
of
his
talk
,
'
continued
the
other
;
`
he
bothered
*NL*
me
enough
when
he
was
here
.
``
Each
station
should
be
like
a
beacon
on
the
*NL*
road
towards
better
things
,
a
centre
for
trade
of
course
,
but
also
for
*NL*
humanizing
,
improving
,
instructing
.
''
Conceive
you
--
that
ass
!
And
*NL*
he
wants
to
be
manager
!
No
,
it
's
--
'
Here
he
got
choked
by
excessive
*NL*
indignation
,
and
I
lifted
my
head
the
least
bit
.
I
was
surprised
to
see
*NL*
how
near
they
were
--
right
under
me
.
I
could
have
spat
upon
their
hats
.
*NL*
They
were
looking
on
the
ground
,
absorbed
in
thought
.
The
manager
was
*NL*
switching
his
leg
with
a
slender
twig
:
his
sagacious
relative
lifted
his
*NL*
head
.
`
You
have
been
well
since
you
came
out
this
time
?
'
he
asked
.
The
*NL*
other
gave
a
start
.
`
Who
?
I
?
Oh
!
Like
a
charm
--
like
a
charm
.
But
the
*NL*
rest
--
oh
,
my
goodness
!
All
sick
.
They
die
so
quick
,
too
,
that
I
have
n't
*NL*
the
time
to
send
them
out
of
the
country
--
it
's
incredible
!
'
`
Hm
'm
.
*NL*
Just
so
,
'
grunted
the
uncle
.
`
Ah
!
my
boy
,
trust
to
this
--
I
say
,
trust
to
*NL*
this
.
'
I
saw
him
extend
his
short
flipper
of
an
arm
for
a
gesture
that
*NL*
took
in
the
forest
,
the
creek
,
the
mud
,
the
river
--
seemed
to
beckon
*NL*
with
a
dishonouring
flourish
before
the
sunlit
face
of
the
land
a
*NL*
treacherous
appeal
to
the
lurking
death
,
to
the
hidden
evil
,
to
the
*NL*
profound
darkness
of
its
heart
.
It
was
so
startling
that
I
leaped
to
my
*NL*
feet
and
looked
back
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
,
as
though
I
had
expected
*NL*
an
answer
of
some
sort
to
that
black
display
of
confidence
.
You
know
*NL*
the
foolish
notions
that
come
to
one
sometimes
.
The
high
stillness
*NL*
confronted
these
two
figures
with
its
ominous
patience
,
waiting
for
the
*NL*
passing
away
of
a
fantastic
invasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
swore
aloud
together
--
out
of
sheer
fright
,
I
believe
--
then
*NL*
pretending
not
to
know
anything
of
my
existence
,
turned
back
to
the
*NL*
station
.
The
sun
was
low
;
and
leaning
forward
side
by
side
,
they
seemed
*NL*
to
be
tugging
painfully
uphill
their
two
ridiculous
shadows
of
unequal
*NL*
length
,
that
trailed
behind
them
slowly
over
the
tall
grass
without
*NL*
bending
a
single
blade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
few
days
the
Eldorado
Expedition
went
into
the
patient
wilderness
,
*NL*
that
closed
upon
it
as
the
sea
closes
over
a
diver
.
Long
afterwards
the
*NL*
news
came
that
all
the
donkeys
were
dead
.
I
know
nothing
as
to
the
fate
*NL*
of
the
less
valuable
animals
.
They
,
no
doubt
,
like
the
rest
of
us
,
found
*NL*
what
they
deserved
.
I
did
not
inquire
.
I
was
then
rather
excited
at
*NL*
the
prospect
of
meeting
Kurtz
very
soon
.
When
I
say
very
soon
I
mean
*NL*
it
comparatively
.
It
was
just
two
months
from
the
day
we
left
the
creek
*NL*
when
we
came
to
the
bank
below
Kurtz
's
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
up
that
river
was
like
traveling
back
to
the
earliest
beginnings
*NL*
of
the
world
,
when
vegetation
rioted
on
the
earth
and
the
big
trees
were
*NL*
kings
.
An
empty
stream
,
a
great
silence
,
an
impenetrable
forest
.
The
air
*NL*
was
warm
,
thick
,
heavy
,
sluggish
.
There
was
no
joy
in
the
brilliance
of
*NL*
sunshine
.
The
long
stretches
of
the
waterway
ran
on
,
deserted
,
into
*NL*
the
gloom
of
overshadowed
distances
.
On
silvery
sand-banks
hippos
and
*NL*
alligators
sunned
themselves
side
by
side
.
The
broadening
waters
flowed
*NL*
through
a
mob
of
wooded
islands
;
you
lost
your
way
on
that
river
as
you
*NL*
would
in
a
desert
,
and
butted
all
day
long
against
shoals
,
trying
to
*NL*
find
the
channel
,
till
you
thought
yourself
bewitched
and
cut
off
for
*NL*
ever
from
everything
you
had
known
once
--
somewhere
--
far
away
--
in
another
*NL*
existence
perhaps
.
There
were
moments
when
one
's
past
came
back
to
one
,
*NL*
as
it
will
sometimes
when
you
have
not
a
moment
to
spare
for
yourself
;
*NL*
but
it
came
in
the
shape
of
an
unrestful
and
noisy
dream
,
remembered
*NL*
with
wonder
amongst
the
overwhelming
realities
of
this
strange
world
of
*NL*
plants
,
and
water
,
and
silence
.
And
this
stillness
of
life
did
not
in
*NL*
the
least
resemble
a
peace
.
It
was
the
stillness
of
an
implacable
force
*NL*
brooding
over
an
inscrutable
intention
.
It
looked
at
you
with
a
vengeful
*NL*
aspect
.
I
got
used
to
it
afterwards
;
I
did
not
see
it
any
more
;
I
had
no
*NL*
time
.
I
had
to
keep
guessing
at
the
channel
;
I
had
to
discern
,
mostly
by
*NL*
inspiration
,
the
signs
of
hidden
banks
;
I
watched
for
sunken
stones
;
I
*NL*
was
learning
to
clap
my
teeth
smartly
before
my
heart
flew
out
,
when
I
*NL*
shaved
by
a
fluke
some
infernal
sly
old
snag
that
would
have
ripped
the
*NL*
life
out
of
the
tin-pot
steamboat
and
drowned
all
the
pilgrims
;
I
had
to
*NL*
keep
a
lookout
for
the
signs
of
dead
wood
we
could
cut
up
in
the
night
*NL*
for
next
day
's
steaming
.
When
you
have
to
attend
to
things
of
that
sort
,
*NL*
to
the
mere
incidents
of
the
surface
,
the
reality
--
the
reality
,
I
tell
*NL*
you
--
fades
.
The
inner
truth
is
hidden
--
luckily
,
luckily
.
But
I
felt
it
*NL*
all
the
same
;
I
felt
often
its
mysterious
stillness
watching
me
at
*NL*
my
monkey
tricks
,
just
as
it
watches
you
fellows
performing
on
your
*NL*
respective
tight-ropes
for
--
what
is
it
?
half-a-crown
a
tumble
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
to
be
civil
,
Marlow
,
''
growled
a
voice
,
and
I
knew
there
was
at
*NL*
least
one
listener
awake
besides
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
.
I
forgot
the
heartache
which
makes
up
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
price
.
And
indeed
what
does
the
price
matter
,
if
the
trick
be
well
*NL*
done
?
You
do
your
tricks
very
well
.
And
I
did
n't
do
badly
either
,
since
*NL*
I
managed
not
to
sink
that
steamboat
on
my
first
trip
.
It
's
a
wonder
to
*NL*
me
yet
.
Imagine
a
blindfolded
man
set
to
drive
a
van
over
a
bad
road
.
*NL*
I
sweated
and
shivered
over
that
business
considerably
,
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
.
After
all
,
for
a
seaman
,
to
scrape
the
bottom
of
the
thing
that
's
*NL*
supposed
to
float
all
the
time
under
his
care
is
the
unpardonable
sin
.
*NL*
No
one
may
know
of
it
,
but
you
never
forget
the
thump
--
eh
?
A
blow
on
the
*NL*
very
heart
.
You
remember
it
,
you
dream
of
it
,
you
wake
up
at
night
and
*NL*
think
of
it
--
years
after
--
and
go
hot
and
cold
all
over
.
I
do
n't
pretend
*NL*
to
say
that
steamboat
floated
all
the
time
.
More
than
once
she
had
to
*NL*
wade
for
a
bit
,
with
twenty
cannibals
splashing
around
and
pushing
.
*NL*
We
had
enlisted
some
of
these
chaps
on
the
way
for
a
crew
.
Fine
*NL*
fellows
--
cannibals
--
in
their
place
.
They
were
men
one
could
work
with
,
*NL*
and
I
am
grateful
to
them
.
And
,
after
all
,
they
did
not
eat
each
other
*NL*
before
my
face
:
they
had
brought
along
a
provision
of
hippo-meat
*NL*
which
went
rotten
,
and
made
the
mystery
of
the
wilderness
stink
in
my
*NL*
nostrils
.
Phoo
!
I
can
sniff
it
now
.
I
had
the
manager
on
board
and
three
*NL*
or
four
pilgrims
with
their
staves
--
all
complete
.
Sometimes
we
came
*NL*
upon
a
station
close
by
the
bank
,
clinging
to
the
skirts
of
the
unknown
,
*NL*
and
the
white
men
rushing
out
of
a
tumble-down
hovel
,
with
great
*NL*
gestures
of
joy
and
surprise
and
welcome
,
seemed
very
strange
--
had
the
*NL*
appearance
of
being
held
there
captive
by
a
spell
.
The
word
ivory
would
*NL*
ring
in
the
air
for
a
while
--
and
on
we
went
again
into
the
silence
,
*NL*
along
empty
reaches
,
round
the
still
bends
,
between
the
high
walls
of
*NL*
our
winding
way
,
reverberating
in
hollow
claps
the
ponderous
beat
of
the
*NL*
stern-wheel
.
Trees
,
trees
,
millions
of
trees
,
massive
,
immense
,
running
*NL*
up
high
;
and
at
their
foot
,
hugging
the
bank
against
the
stream
,
crept
*NL*
the
little
begrimed
steamboat
,
like
a
sluggish
beetle
crawling
on
the
*NL*
floor
of
a
lofty
portico
.
It
made
you
feel
very
small
,
very
lost
,
and
*NL*
yet
it
was
not
altogether
depressing
,
that
feeling
.
After
all
,
if
you
*NL*
were
small
,
the
grimy
beetle
crawled
on
--
which
was
just
what
you
wanted
*NL*
it
to
do
.
Where
the
pilgrims
imagined
it
crawled
to
I
do
n't
know
.
*NL*
To
some
place
where
they
expected
to
get
something
.
I
bet
!
For
me
it
*NL*
crawled
towards
Kurtz
--
exclusively
;
but
when
the
steam-pipes
started
*NL*
leaking
we
crawled
very
slow
.
The
reaches
opened
before
us
and
closed
*NL*
behind
,
as
if
the
forest
had
stepped
leisurely
across
the
water
to
bar
*NL*
the
way
for
our
return
.
We
penetrated
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
heart
*NL*
of
darkness
.
It
was
very
quiet
there
.
At
night
sometimes
the
roll
of
*NL*
drums
behind
the
curtain
of
trees
would
run
up
the
river
and
remain
*NL*
sustained
faintly
,
as
if
hovering
in
the
air
high
over
our
heads
,
till
*NL*
the
first
break
of
day
.
Whether
it
meant
war
,
peace
,
or
prayer
we
could
*NL*
not
tell
.
The
dawns
were
heralded
by
the
descent
of
a
chill
stillness
;
*NL*
the
wood-cutters
slept
,
their
fires
burned
low
;
the
snapping
of
a
twig
*NL*
would
make
you
start
.
We
were
wanderers
on
a
prehistoric
earth
,
on
an
*NL*
earth
that
wore
the
aspect
of
an
unknown
planet
.
We
could
have
fancied
*NL*
ourselves
the
first
of
men
taking
possession
of
an
accursed
inheritance
,
*NL*
to
be
subdued
at
the
cost
of
profound
anguish
and
of
excessive
toil
.
But
*NL*
suddenly
,
as
we
struggled
round
a
bend
,
there
would
be
a
glimpse
of
rush
*NL*
walls
,
of
peaked
grass-roofs
,
a
burst
of
yells
,
a
whirl
of
black
limbs
,
*NL*
a
mass
of
hands
clapping
of
feet
stamping
,
of
bodies
swaying
,
of
eyes
*NL*
rolling
,
under
the
droop
of
heavy
and
motionless
foliage
.
The
steamer
*NL*
toiled
along
slowly
on
the
edge
of
a
black
and
incomprehensible
frenzy
.
*NL*
The
prehistoric
man
was
cursing
us
,
praying
to
us
,
welcoming
us
--
who
*NL*
could
tell
?
We
were
cut
off
from
the
comprehension
of
our
surroundings
;
*NL*
we
glided
past
like
phantoms
,
wondering
and
secretly
appalled
,
as
sane
*NL*
men
would
be
before
an
enthusiastic
outbreak
in
a
madhouse
.
We
could
*NL*
not
understand
because
we
were
too
far
and
could
not
remember
because
we
*NL*
were
travelling
in
the
night
of
first
ages
,
of
those
ages
that
are
gone
,
*NL*
leaving
hardly
a
sign
--
and
no
memories
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
earth
seemed
unearthly
.
We
are
accustomed
to
look
upon
the
shackled
*NL*
form
of
a
conquered
monster
,
but
there
--
there
you
could
look
at
a
thing
*NL*
monstrous
and
free
.
It
was
unearthly
,
and
the
men
were
--
No
,
they
were
*NL*
not
inhuman
.
Well
,
you
know
,
that
was
the
worst
of
it
--
this
suspicion
*NL*
of
their
not
being
inhuman
.
It
would
come
slowly
to
one
.
They
howled
and
*NL*
leaped
,
and
spun
,
and
made
horrid
faces
;
but
what
thrilled
you
was
just
*NL*
the
thought
of
their
humanity
--
like
yours
--
the
thought
of
your
remote
*NL*
kinship
with
this
wild
and
passionate
uproar
.
Ugly
.
Yes
,
it
was
ugly
*NL*
enough
;
but
if
you
were
man
enough
you
would
admit
to
yourself
that
*NL*
there
was
in
you
just
the
faintest
trace
of
a
response
to
the
terrible
*NL*
frankness
of
that
noise
,
a
dim
suspicion
of
there
being
a
meaning
in
it
*NL*
which
you
--
you
so
remote
from
the
night
of
first
ages
--
could
comprehend
.
*NL*
And
why
not
?
The
mind
of
man
is
capable
of
anything
--
because
everything
*NL*
is
in
it
,
all
the
past
as
well
as
all
the
future
.
What
was
there
after
*NL*
all
?
Joy
,
fear
,
sorrow
,
devotion
,
valour
,
rage
--
who
can
tell
?
--
but
*NL*
truth
--
truth
stripped
of
its
cloak
of
time
.
Let
the
fool
gape
and
*NL*
shudder
--
the
man
knows
,
and
can
look
on
without
a
wink
.
But
he
must
at
*NL*
least
be
as
much
of
a
man
as
these
on
the
shore
.
He
must
meet
that
truth
*NL*
with
his
own
true
stuff
--
with
his
own
inborn
strength
.
Principles
wo
n't
*NL*
do
.
Acquisitions
,
clothes
,
pretty
rags
--
rags
that
would
fly
off
at
the
*NL*
first
good
shake
.
No
;
you
want
a
deliberate
belief
.
An
appeal
to
me
in
*NL*
this
fiendish
row
--
is
there
?
Very
well
;
I
hear
;
I
admit
,
but
I
have
*NL*
a
voice
,
too
,
and
for
good
or
evil
mine
is
the
speech
that
can
not
be
*NL*
silenced
.
Of
course
,
a
fool
,
what
with
sheer
fright
and
fine
sentiments
,
*NL*
is
always
safe
.
Who
's
that
grunting
?
You
wonder
I
did
n't
go
ashore
for
*NL*
a
howl
and
a
dance
?
Well
,
no
--
I
did
n't
.
Fine
sentiments
,
you
say
?
*NL*
Fine
sentiments
,
be
hanged
!
I
had
no
time
.
I
had
to
mess
about
with
*NL*
white-lead
and
strips
of
woolen
blanket
helping
to
put
bandages
on
*NL*
those
leaky
steam-pipes
--
I
tell
you
.
I
had
to
watch
the
steering
,
and
*NL*
circumvent
those
snags
,
and
get
the
tin-pot
along
by
hook
or
by
crook
.
*NL*
There
was
surface-truth
enough
in
these
things
to
save
a
wiser
man
.
And
*NL*
between
whiles
I
had
to
look
after
the
savage
who
was
fireman
.
He
was
*NL*
an
improved
specimen
;
he
could
fire
up
a
vertical
boiler
.
He
was
there
*NL*
below
me
,
and
,
upon
my
word
,
to
look
at
him
was
as
edifying
as
seeing
a
*NL*
dog
in
a
parody
of
breeches
and
a
feather
hat
,
walking
on
his
hind-legs
.
*NL*
A
few
months
of
training
had
done
for
that
really
fine
chap
.
He
squinted
*NL*
at
the
steam-gauge
and
at
the
water-gauge
with
an
evident
effort
of
*NL*
intrepidity
--
and
he
had
filed
teeth
,
too
,
the
poor
devil
,
and
the
wool
*NL*
of
his
pate
shaved
into
queer
patterns
,
and
three
ornamental
scars
*NL*
on
each
of
his
cheeks
.
He
ought
to
have
been
clapping
his
hands
and
*NL*
stamping
his
feet
on
the
bank
,
instead
of
which
he
was
hard
at
work
,
a
*NL*
thrall
to
strange
witchcraft
,
full
of
improving
knowledge
.
He
was
useful
*NL*
because
he
had
been
instructed
;
and
what
he
knew
was
this
--
that
should
*NL*
the
water
in
that
transparent
thing
disappear
,
the
evil
spirit
inside
*NL*
the
boiler
would
get
angry
through
the
greatness
of
his
thirst
,
and
take
*NL*
a
terrible
vengeance
.
So
he
sweated
and
fired
up
and
watched
the
glass
*NL*
fearfully
-LRB-
with
an
impromptu
charm
,
made
of
rags
,
tied
to
his
arm
,
and
*NL*
a
piece
of
polished
bone
,
as
big
as
a
watch
,
stuck
flatways
through
his
*NL*
lower
lip
-RRB-
,
while
the
wooded
banks
slipped
past
us
slowly
,
the
short
*NL*
noise
was
left
behind
,
the
interminable
miles
of
silence
--
and
we
crept
*NL*
on
,
towards
Kurtz
.
But
the
snags
were
thick
,
the
water
was
treacherous
*NL*
and
shallow
,
the
boiler
seemed
indeed
to
have
a
sulky
devil
in
it
,
and
*NL*
thus
neither
that
fireman
nor
I
had
any
time
to
peer
into
our
creepy
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
fifty
miles
below
the
Inner
Station
we
came
upon
a
hut
of
reeds
,
*NL*
an
inclined
and
melancholy
pole
,
with
the
unrecognizable
tatters
of
*NL*
what
had
been
a
flag
of
some
sort
flying
from
it
,
and
a
neatly
stacked
*NL*
wood-pile
.
This
was
unexpected
.
We
came
to
the
bank
,
and
on
the
stack
of
*NL*
firewood
found
a
flat
piece
of
board
with
some
faded
pencil-writing
*NL*
on
it
.
When
deciphered
it
said
:
`
Wood
for
you
.
Hurry
up
.
Approach
*NL*
cautiously
.
'
There
was
a
signature
,
but
it
was
illegible
--
not
*NL*
Kurtz
--
a
much
longer
word
.
`
Hurry
up
.
'
Where
?
Up
the
river
?
`
Approach
*NL*
cautiously
.
'
We
had
not
done
so
.
But
the
warning
could
not
have
been
*NL*
meant
for
the
place
where
it
could
be
only
found
after
approach
.
*NL*
Something
was
wrong
above
.
But
what
--
and
how
much
?
That
was
the
*NL*
question
.
We
commented
adversely
upon
the
imbecility
of
that
telegraphic
*NL*
style
.
The
bush
around
said
nothing
,
and
would
not
let
us
look
very
far
,
*NL*
either
.
A
torn
curtain
of
red
twill
hung
in
the
doorway
of
the
hut
,
and
*NL*
flapped
sadly
in
our
faces
.
The
dwelling
was
dismantled
;
but
we
could
*NL*
see
a
white
man
had
lived
there
not
very
long
ago
.
There
remained
a
rude
*NL*
table
--
a
plank
on
two
posts
;
a
heap
of
rubbish
reposed
in
a
dark
corner
,
*NL*
and
by
the
door
I
picked
up
a
book
.
It
had
lost
its
covers
,
and
the
*NL*
pages
had
been
thumbed
into
a
state
of
extremely
dirty
softness
;
but
the
*NL*
back
had
been
lovingly
stitched
afresh
with
white
cotton
thread
,
which
*NL*
looked
clean
yet
.
It
was
an
extraordinary
find
.
Its
title
was
,
_
An
*NL*
Inquiry
into
some
Points
of
Seamanship
_
,
by
a
man
Towser
,
Towson
--
some
*NL*
such
name
--
Master
in
his
Majesty
's
Navy
.
The
matter
looked
dreary
*NL*
reading
enough
,
with
illustrative
diagrams
and
repulsive
tables
of
*NL*
figures
,
and
the
copy
was
sixty
years
old
.
I
handled
this
amazing
*NL*
antiquity
with
the
greatest
possible
tenderness
,
lest
it
should
dissolve
*NL*
in
my
hands
.
Within
,
Towson
or
Towser
was
inquiring
earnestly
into
the
*NL*
breaking
strain
of
ships
'
chains
and
tackle
,
and
other
such
matters
.
Not
*NL*
a
very
enthralling
book
;
but
at
the
first
glance
you
could
see
there
a
*NL*
singleness
of
intention
,
an
honest
concern
for
the
right
way
of
going
*NL*
to
work
,
which
made
these
humble
pages
,
thought
out
so
many
years
ago
,
*NL*
luminous
with
another
than
a
professional
light
.
The
simple
old
sailor
,
*NL*
with
his
talk
of
chains
and
purchases
,
made
me
forget
the
jungle
and
*NL*
the
pilgrims
in
a
delicious
sensation
of
having
come
upon
something
*NL*
unmistakably
real
.
Such
a
book
being
there
was
wonderful
enough
;
but
*NL*
still
more
astounding
were
the
notes
pencilled
in
the
margin
,
and
*NL*
plainly
referring
to
the
text
.
I
could
n't
believe
my
eyes
!
They
were
in
*NL*
cipher
!
Yes
,
it
looked
like
cipher
.
Fancy
a
man
lugging
with
him
a
*NL*
book
of
that
description
into
this
nowhere
and
studying
it
--
and
making
*NL*
notes
--
in
cipher
at
that
!
It
was
an
extravagant
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
been
dimly
aware
for
some
time
of
a
worrying
noise
,
and
when
I
*NL*
lifted
my
eyes
I
saw
the
wood-pile
was
gone
,
and
the
manager
,
aided
by
*NL*
all
the
pilgrims
,
was
shouting
at
me
from
the
riverside
.
I
slipped
the
*NL*
book
into
my
pocket
.
I
assure
you
to
leave
off
reading
was
like
tearing
*NL*
myself
away
from
the
shelter
of
an
old
and
solid
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
started
the
lame
engine
ahead
.
`
It
must
be
this
miserable
trader
--
this
*NL*
intruder
,
'
exclaimed
the
manager
,
looking
back
malevolently
at
the
place
*NL*
we
had
left
.
`
He
must
be
English
,
'
I
said
.
`
It
will
not
save
him
from
*NL*
getting
into
trouble
if
he
is
not
careful
,
'
muttered
the
manager
darkly
.
*NL*
I
observed
with
assumed
innocence
that
no
man
was
safe
from
trouble
in
*NL*
this
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
current
was
more
rapid
now
,
the
steamer
seemed
at
her
last
gasp
,
*NL*
the
stern-wheel
flopped
languidly
,
and
I
caught
myself
listening
on
*NL*
tiptoe
for
the
next
beat
of
the
boat
,
for
in
sober
truth
I
expected
the
*NL*
wretched
thing
to
give
up
every
moment
.
It
was
like
watching
the
last
*NL*
flickers
of
a
life
.
But
still
we
crawled
.
Sometimes
I
would
pick
out
a
*NL*
tree
a
little
way
ahead
to
measure
our
progress
towards
Kurtz
by
,
but
*NL*
I
lost
it
invariably
before
we
got
abreast
.
To
keep
the
eyes
so
long
*NL*
on
one
thing
was
too
much
for
human
patience
.
The
manager
displayed
*NL*
a
beautiful
resignation
.
I
fretted
and
fumed
and
took
to
arguing
with
*NL*
myself
whether
or
no
I
would
talk
openly
with
Kurtz
;
but
before
I
could
*NL*
come
to
any
conclusion
it
occurred
to
me
that
my
speech
or
my
silence
,
*NL*
indeed
any
action
of
mine
,
would
be
a
mere
futility
.
What
did
it
matter
*NL*
what
any
one
knew
or
ignored
?
What
did
it
matter
who
was
manager
?
One
*NL*
gets
sometimes
such
a
flash
of
insight
.
The
essentials
of
this
affair
*NL*
lay
deep
under
the
surface
,
beyond
my
reach
,
and
beyond
my
power
of
*NL*
meddling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Towards
the
evening
of
the
second
day
we
judged
ourselves
about
eight
*NL*
miles
from
Kurtz
's
station
.
I
wanted
to
push
on
;
but
the
manager
looked
*NL*
grave
,
and
told
me
the
navigation
up
there
was
so
dangerous
that
it
*NL*
would
be
advisable
,
the
sun
being
very
low
already
,
to
wait
where
we
*NL*
were
till
next
morning
.
Moreover
,
he
pointed
out
that
if
the
warning
*NL*
to
approach
cautiously
were
to
be
followed
,
we
must
approach
in
*NL*
daylight
--
not
at
dusk
or
in
the
dark
.
This
was
sensible
enough
.
Eight
*NL*
miles
meant
nearly
three
hours
'
steaming
for
us
,
and
I
could
also
see
*NL*
suspicious
ripples
at
the
upper
end
of
the
reach
.
Nevertheless
,
I
was
*NL*
annoyed
beyond
expression
at
the
delay
,
and
most
unreasonably
,
too
,
*NL*
since
one
night
more
could
not
matter
much
after
so
many
months
.
As
we
*NL*
had
plenty
of
wood
,
and
caution
was
the
word
,
I
brought
up
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
stream
.
The
reach
was
narrow
,
straight
,
with
high
sides
like
a
*NL*
railway
cutting
.
The
dusk
came
gliding
into
it
long
before
the
sun
had
*NL*
set
.
The
current
ran
smooth
and
swift
,
but
a
dumb
immobility
sat
on
the
*NL*
banks
.
The
living
trees
,
lashed
together
by
the
creepers
and
every
*NL*
living
bush
of
the
undergrowth
,
might
have
been
changed
into
stone
,
even
*NL*
to
the
slenderest
twig
,
to
the
lightest
leaf
.
It
was
not
sleep
--
it
*NL*
seemed
unnatural
,
like
a
state
of
trance
.
Not
the
faintest
sound
of
any
*NL*
kind
could
be
heard
.
You
looked
on
amazed
,
and
began
to
suspect
yourself
*NL*
of
being
deaf
--
then
the
night
came
suddenly
,
and
struck
you
blind
as
*NL*
well
.
About
three
in
the
morning
some
large
fish
leaped
,
and
the
loud
*NL*
splash
made
me
jump
as
though
a
gun
had
been
fired
.
When
the
sun
rose
*NL*
there
was
a
white
fog
,
very
warm
and
clammy
,
and
more
blinding
than
the
*NL*
night
.
It
did
not
shift
or
drive
;
it
was
just
there
,
standing
all
round
*NL*
you
like
something
solid
.
At
eight
or
nine
,
perhaps
,
it
lifted
as
a
*NL*
shutter
lifts
.
We
had
a
glimpse
of
the
towering
multitude
of
trees
,
of
*NL*
the
immense
matted
jungle
,
with
the
blazing
little
ball
of
the
sun
*NL*
hanging
over
it
--
all
perfectly
still
--
and
then
the
white
shutter
came
*NL*
down
again
,
smoothly
,
as
if
sliding
in
greased
grooves
.
I
ordered
the
*NL*
chain
,
which
we
had
begun
to
heave
in
,
to
be
paid
out
again
.
Before
it
*NL*
stopped
running
with
a
muffled
rattle
,
a
cry
,
a
very
loud
cry
,
as
of
*NL*
infinite
desolation
,
soared
slowly
in
the
opaque
air
.
It
ceased
.
A
*NL*
complaining
clamour
,
modulated
in
savage
discords
,
filled
our
ears
.
The
*NL*
sheer
unexpectedness
of
it
made
my
hair
stir
under
my
cap
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
it
struck
the
others
:
to
me
it
seemed
as
though
the
mist
itself
had
*NL*
screamed
,
so
suddenly
,
and
apparently
from
all
sides
at
once
,
did
this
*NL*
tumultuous
and
mournful
uproar
arise
.
It
culminated
in
a
hurried
*NL*
outbreak
of
almost
intolerably
excessive
shrieking
,
which
stopped
short
,
*NL*
leaving
us
stiffened
in
a
variety
of
silly
attitudes
,
and
obstinately
*NL*
listening
to
the
nearly
as
appalling
and
excessive
silence
.
`
Good
God
!
*NL*
What
is
the
meaning
--
'
stammered
at
my
elbow
one
of
the
pilgrims
--
a
*NL*
little
fat
man
,
with
sandy
hair
and
red
whiskers
,
who
wore
sidespring
*NL*
boots
,
and
pink
pyjamas
tucked
into
his
socks
.
Two
others
remained
*NL*
open-mouthed
a
while
minute
,
then
dashed
into
the
little
cabin
,
to
rush
*NL*
out
incontinently
and
stand
darting
scared
glances
,
with
Winchesters
at
*NL*
`
ready
'
in
their
hands
.
What
we
could
see
was
just
the
steamer
we
were
*NL*
on
,
her
outlines
blurred
as
though
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
*NL*
dissolving
,
and
a
misty
strip
of
water
,
perhaps
two
feet
broad
,
around
*NL*
her
--
and
that
was
all
.
The
rest
of
the
world
was
nowhere
,
as
far
as
our
*NL*
eyes
and
ears
were
concerned
.
Just
nowhere
.
Gone
,
disappeared
;
swept
off
*NL*
without
leaving
a
whisper
or
a
shadow
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
forward
,
and
ordered
the
chain
to
be
hauled
in
short
,
so
as
to
*NL*
be
ready
to
trip
the
anchor
and
move
the
steamboat
at
once
if
necessary
.
*NL*
`
Will
they
attack
?
'
whispered
an
awed
voice
.
`
We
will
be
all
butchered
*NL*
in
this
fog
,
'
murmured
another
.
The
faces
twitched
with
the
strain
,
the
*NL*
hands
trembled
slightly
,
the
eyes
forgot
to
wink
.
It
was
very
curious
*NL*
to
see
the
contrast
of
expressions
of
the
white
men
and
of
the
black
*NL*
fellows
of
our
crew
,
who
were
as
much
strangers
to
that
part
of
the
*NL*
river
as
we
,
though
their
homes
were
only
eight
hundred
miles
away
.
The
*NL*
whites
,
of
course
greatly
discomposed
,
had
besides
a
curious
look
of
*NL*
being
painfully
shocked
by
such
an
outrageous
row
.
The
others
had
an
*NL*
alert
,
naturally
interested
expression
;
but
their
faces
were
essentially
*NL*
quiet
,
even
those
of
the
one
or
two
who
grinned
as
they
hauled
at
the
*NL*
chain
.
Several
exchanged
short
,
grunting
phrases
,
which
seemed
to
settle
*NL*
the
matter
to
their
satisfaction
.
Their
headman
,
a
young
,
broad-chested
*NL*
black
,
severely
draped
in
dark-blue
fringed
cloths
,
with
fierce
nostrils
*NL*
and
his
hair
all
done
up
artfully
in
oily
ringlets
,
stood
near
me
.
*NL*
`
Aha
!
'
I
said
,
just
for
good
fellowship
's
sake
.
`
Catch
`
im
,
'
he
snapped
,
*NL*
with
a
bloodshot
widening
of
his
eyes
and
a
flash
of
sharp
teeth
--
`
catch
*NL*
`
im
.
Give
`
im
to
us
.
'
`
To
you
,
eh
?
'
I
asked
;
`
what
would
you
do
with
*NL*
them
?
'
`
Eat
`
im
!
'
he
said
curtly
,
and
,
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
rail
,
*NL*
looked
out
into
the
fog
in
a
dignified
and
profoundly
pensive
attitude
.
*NL*
I
would
no
doubt
have
been
properly
horrified
,
had
it
not
occurred
to
*NL*
me
that
he
and
his
chaps
must
be
very
hungry
:
that
they
must
have
been
*NL*
growing
increasingly
hungry
for
at
least
this
month
past
.
They
had
been
*NL*
engaged
for
six
months
-LRB-
I
do
n't
think
a
single
one
of
them
had
any
*NL*
clear
idea
of
time
,
as
we
at
the
end
of
countless
ages
have
.
They
still
*NL*
belonged
to
the
beginnings
of
time
--
had
no
inherited
experience
to
teach
*NL*
them
as
it
were
-RRB-
,
and
of
course
,
as
long
as
there
was
a
piece
of
paper
*NL*
written
over
in
accordance
with
some
farcical
law
or
other
made
down
the
*NL*
river
,
it
did
n't
enter
anybody
's
head
to
trouble
how
they
would
live
.
*NL*
Certainly
they
had
brought
with
them
some
rotten
hippo-meat
,
which
*NL*
could
n't
have
lasted
very
long
,
anyway
,
even
if
the
pilgrims
had
n't
,
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
a
shocking
hullabaloo
,
thrown
a
considerable
quantity
of
it
*NL*
overboard
.
It
looked
like
a
high-handed
proceeding
;
but
it
was
really
*NL*
a
case
of
legitimate
self-defence
.
You
ca
n't
breathe
dead
hippo
waking
,
*NL*
sleeping
,
and
eating
,
and
at
the
same
time
keep
your
precarious
grip
on
*NL*
existence
.
Besides
that
,
they
had
given
them
every
week
three
pieces
of
*NL*
brass
wire
,
each
about
nine
inches
long
;
and
the
theory
was
they
were
to
*NL*
buy
their
provisions
with
that
currency
in
riverside
villages
.
You
can
*NL*
see
how
_
that
_
worked
.
There
were
either
no
villages
,
or
the
people
were
*NL*
hostile
,
or
the
director
,
who
like
the
rest
of
us
fed
out
of
tins
,
with
*NL*
an
occasional
old
he-goat
thrown
in
,
did
n't
want
to
stop
the
steamer
for
*NL*
some
more
or
less
recondite
reason
.
So
,
unless
they
swallowed
the
wire
*NL*
itself
,
or
made
loops
of
it
to
snare
the
fishes
with
,
I
do
n't
see
what
*NL*
good
their
extravagant
salary
could
be
to
them
.
I
must
say
it
was
paid
*NL*
with
a
regularity
worthy
of
a
large
and
honourable
trading
company
.
For
*NL*
the
rest
,
the
only
thing
to
eat
--
though
it
did
n't
look
eatable
in
the
*NL*
least
--
I
saw
in
their
possession
was
a
few
lumps
of
some
stuff
like
*NL*
half-cooked
dough
,
of
a
dirty
lavender
colour
,
they
kept
wrapped
in
*NL*
leaves
,
and
now
and
then
swallowed
a
piece
of
,
but
so
small
that
it
*NL*
seemed
done
more
for
the
looks
of
the
thing
than
for
any
serious
purpose
*NL*
of
sustenance
.
Why
in
the
name
of
all
the
gnawing
devils
of
hunger
they
*NL*
did
n't
go
for
us
--
they
were
thirty
to
five
--
and
have
a
good
tuck-in
for
*NL*
once
,
amazes
me
now
when
I
think
of
it
.
They
were
big
powerful
men
,
*NL*
with
not
much
capacity
to
weigh
the
consequences
,
with
courage
,
with
*NL*
strength
,
even
yet
,
though
their
skins
were
no
longer
glossy
and
their
*NL*
muscles
no
longer
hard
.
And
I
saw
that
something
restraining
,
one
of
*NL*
those
human
secrets
that
baffle
probability
,
had
come
into
play
there
.
*NL*
I
looked
at
them
with
a
swift
quickening
of
interest
--
not
because
it
*NL*
occurred
to
me
I
might
be
eaten
by
them
before
very
long
,
though
I
own
*NL*
to
you
that
just
then
I
perceived
--
in
a
new
light
,
as
it
were
--
how
*NL*
unwholesome
the
pilgrims
looked
,
and
I
hoped
,
yes
,
I
positively
hoped
,
*NL*
that
my
aspect
was
not
so
--
what
shall
I
say
?
--
so
--
unappetizing
:
a
touch
*NL*
of
fantastic
vanity
which
fitted
well
with
the
dream-sensation
that
*NL*
pervaded
all
my
days
at
that
time
.
Perhaps
I
had
a
little
fever
,
too
.
*NL*
One
ca
n't
live
with
one
's
finger
everlastingly
on
one
's
pulse
.
I
had
*NL*
often
'
a
little
fever
,
'
or
a
little
touch
of
other
things
--
the
playful
*NL*
paw-strokes
of
the
wilderness
,
the
preliminary
trifling
before
the
more
*NL*
serious
onslaught
which
came
in
due
course
.
Yes
;
I
looked
at
them
as
you
*NL*
would
on
any
human
being
,
with
a
curiosity
of
their
impulses
,
motives
,
*NL*
capacities
,
weaknesses
,
when
brought
to
the
test
of
an
inexorable
*NL*
physical
necessity
.
Restraint
!
What
possible
restraint
?
Was
it
*NL*
superstition
,
disgust
,
patience
,
fear
--
or
some
kind
of
primitive
honour
?
*NL*
No
fear
can
stand
up
to
hunger
,
no
patience
can
wear
it
out
,
disgust
*NL*
simply
does
not
exist
where
hunger
is
;
and
as
to
superstition
,
beliefs
,
*NL*
and
what
you
may
call
principles
,
they
are
less
than
chaff
in
a
breeze
.
*NL*
Do
n't
you
know
the
devilry
of
lingering
starvation
,
its
exasperating
*NL*
torment
,
its
black
thoughts
,
its
sombre
and
brooding
ferocity
?
Well
,
*NL*
I
do
.
It
takes
a
man
all
his
inborn
strength
to
fight
hunger
properly
.
*NL*
It
's
really
easier
to
face
bereavement
,
dishonour
,
and
the
perdition
of
*NL*
one
's
soul
--
than
this
kind
of
prolonged
hunger
.
Sad
,
but
true
.
And
these
*NL*
chaps
,
too
,
had
no
earthly
reason
for
any
kind
of
scruple
.
Restraint
!
I
*NL*
would
just
as
soon
have
expected
restraint
from
a
hyena
prowling
amongst
*NL*
the
corpses
of
a
battlefield
.
But
there
was
the
fact
facing
me
--
the
fact
*NL*
dazzling
,
to
be
seen
,
like
the
foam
on
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
like
a
*NL*
ripple
on
an
unfathomable
enigma
,
a
mystery
greater
--
when
I
thought
*NL*
of
it
--
than
the
curious
,
inexplicable
note
of
desperate
grief
in
this
*NL*
savage
clamour
that
had
swept
by
us
on
the
river-bank
,
behind
the
blind
*NL*
whiteness
of
the
fog
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
pilgrims
were
quarrelling
in
hurried
whispers
as
to
which
bank
.
*NL*
`
Left
.
'
`
no
,
no
;
how
can
you
?
Right
,
right
,
of
course
.
'
`
It
is
very
*NL*
serious
,
'
said
the
manager
's
voice
behind
me
;
'
I
would
be
desolated
if
*NL*
anything
should
happen
to
Mr.
Kurtz
before
we
came
up
.
'
I
looked
at
him
,
*NL*
and
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
he
was
sincere
.
He
was
just
the
kind
of
*NL*
man
who
would
wish
to
preserve
appearances
.
That
was
his
restraint
.
But
*NL*
when
he
muttered
something
about
going
on
at
once
,
I
did
not
even
take
*NL*
the
trouble
to
answer
him
.
I
knew
,
and
he
knew
,
that
it
was
impossible
.
*NL*
Were
we
to
let
go
our
hold
of
the
bottom
,
we
would
be
absolutely
in
*NL*
the
air
--
in
space
.
We
would
n't
be
able
to
tell
where
we
were
going
*NL*
to
--
whether
up
or
down
stream
,
or
across
--
till
we
fetched
against
one
*NL*
bank
or
the
other
--
and
then
we
would
n't
know
at
first
which
it
was
.
*NL*
Of
course
I
made
no
move
.
I
had
no
mind
for
a
smash-up
.
You
could
n't
*NL*
imagine
a
more
deadly
place
for
a
shipwreck
.
Whether
we
drowned
at
*NL*
once
or
not
,
we
were
sure
to
perish
speedily
in
one
way
or
another
.
'
I
*NL*
authorize
you
to
take
all
the
risks
,
'
he
said
,
after
a
short
silence
.
*NL*
'
I
refuse
to
take
any
,
'
I
said
shortly
;
which
was
just
the
answer
he
*NL*
expected
,
though
its
tone
might
have
surprised
him
.
`
Well
,
I
must
defer
*NL*
to
your
judgment
.
You
are
captain
,
'
he
said
with
marked
civility
.
I
*NL*
turned
my
shoulder
to
him
in
sign
of
my
appreciation
,
and
looked
into
*NL*
the
fog
.
How
long
would
it
last
?
It
was
the
most
hopeless
lookout
.
The
*NL*
approach
to
this
Kurtz
grubbing
for
ivory
in
the
wretched
bush
was
beset
*NL*
by
as
many
dangers
as
though
he
had
been
an
enchanted
princess
sleeping
*NL*
in
a
fabulous
castle
.
`
Will
they
attack
,
do
you
think
?
'
asked
the
*NL*
manager
,
in
a
confidential
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
think
they
would
attack
,
for
several
obvious
reasons
.
The
*NL*
thick
fog
was
one
.
If
they
left
the
bank
in
their
canoes
they
would
get
*NL*
lost
in
it
,
as
we
would
be
if
we
attempted
to
move
.
Still
,
I
had
also
*NL*
judged
the
jungle
of
both
banks
quite
impenetrable
--
and
yet
eyes
were
*NL*
in
it
,
eyes
that
had
seen
us
.
The
riverside
bushes
were
certainly
very
*NL*
thick
;
but
the
undergrowth
behind
was
evidently
penetrable
.
*NL*
However
,
during
the
short
lift
I
had
seen
no
canoes
anywhere
in
the
*NL*
reach
--
certainly
not
abreast
of
the
steamer
.
But
what
made
the
idea
of
*NL*
attack
inconceivable
to
me
was
the
nature
of
the
noise
--
of
the
cries
we
*NL*
had
heard
.
They
had
not
the
fierce
character
boding
immediate
hostile
*NL*
intention
.
Unexpected
,
wild
,
and
violent
as
they
had
been
,
they
had
*NL*
given
me
an
irresistible
impression
of
sorrow
.
The
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
steamboat
had
for
some
reason
filled
those
savages
with
unrestrained
*NL*
grief
.
The
danger
,
if
any
,
I
expounded
,
was
from
our
proximity
to
a
*NL*
great
human
passion
let
loose
.
Even
extreme
grief
may
ultimately
vent
*NL*
itself
in
violence
--
but
more
generally
takes
the
form
of
apathy
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
seen
the
pilgrims
stare
!
They
had
no
heart
to
grin
,
or
*NL*
even
to
revile
me
:
but
I
believe
they
thought
me
gone
mad
--
with
fright
,
*NL*
maybe
.
I
delivered
a
regular
lecture
.
My
dear
boys
,
it
was
no
good
*NL*
bothering
.
Keep
a
lookout
?
Well
,
you
may
guess
I
watched
the
fog
for
*NL*
the
signs
of
lifting
as
a
cat
watches
a
mouse
;
but
for
anything
else
our
*NL*
eyes
were
of
no
more
use
to
us
than
if
we
had
been
buried
miles
deep
in
*NL*
a
heap
of
cotton-wool
.
It
felt
like
it
,
too
--
choking
,
warm
,
stifling
.
*NL*
Besides
,
all
I
said
,
though
it
sounded
extravagant
,
was
absolutely
*NL*
true
to
fact
.
What
we
afterwards
alluded
to
as
an
attack
was
really
an
*NL*
attempt
at
repulse
.
The
action
was
very
far
from
being
aggressive
--
it
*NL*
was
not
even
defensive
,
in
the
usual
sense
:
it
was
undertaken
under
the
*NL*
stress
of
desperation
,
and
in
its
essence
was
purely
protective
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
developed
itself
,
I
should
say
,
two
hours
after
the
fog
lifted
,
and
*NL*
its
commencement
was
at
a
spot
,
roughly
speaking
,
about
a
mile
and
a
*NL*
half
below
Kurtz
's
station
.
We
had
just
floundered
and
flopped
round
a
*NL*
bend
,
when
I
saw
an
islet
,
a
mere
grassy
hummock
of
bright
green
,
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
stream
.
It
was
the
only
thing
of
the
kind
;
but
as
we
opened
*NL*
the
reach
more
,
I
perceived
it
was
the
head
of
a
long
sand-bank
,
or
*NL*
rather
of
a
chain
of
shallow
patches
stretching
down
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
river
.
They
were
discoloured
,
just
awash
,
and
the
whole
lot
was
seen
*NL*
just
under
the
water
,
exactly
as
a
man
's
backbone
is
seen
running
down
*NL*
the
middle
of
his
back
under
the
skin
.
Now
,
as
far
as
I
did
see
,
I
could
*NL*
go
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
of
this
.
I
did
n't
know
either
channel
,
of
*NL*
course
.
The
banks
looked
pretty
well
alike
,
the
depth
appeared
the
same
;
*NL*
but
as
I
had
been
informed
the
station
was
on
the
west
side
,
I
naturally
*NL*
headed
for
the
western
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
sooner
had
we
fairly
entered
it
than
I
became
aware
it
was
much
*NL*
narrower
than
I
had
supposed
.
To
the
left
of
us
there
was
the
long
*NL*
uninterrupted
shoal
,
and
to
the
right
a
high
,
steep
bank
heavily
*NL*
overgrown
with
bushes
.
Above
the
bush
the
trees
stood
in
serried
ranks
.
*NL*
The
twigs
overhung
the
current
thickly
,
and
from
distance
to
distance
a
*NL*
large
limb
of
some
tree
projected
rigidly
over
the
stream
.
It
was
then
*NL*
well
on
in
the
afternoon
,
the
face
of
the
forest
was
gloomy
,
and
a
*NL*
broad
strip
of
shadow
had
already
fallen
on
the
water
.
In
this
shadow
*NL*
we
steamed
up
--
very
slowly
,
as
you
may
imagine
.
I
sheered
her
well
*NL*
inshore
--
the
water
being
deepest
near
the
bank
,
as
the
sounding-pole
*NL*
informed
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
my
hungry
and
forbearing
friends
was
sounding
in
the
bows
just
*NL*
below
me
.
This
steamboat
was
exactly
like
a
decked
scow
.
On
the
deck
,
*NL*
there
were
two
little
teakwood
houses
,
with
doors
and
windows
.
The
*NL*
boiler
was
in
the
fore-end
,
and
the
machinery
right
astern
.
Over
*NL*
the
whole
there
was
a
light
roof
,
supported
on
stanchions
.
The
funnel
*NL*
projected
through
that
roof
,
and
in
front
of
the
funnel
a
small
cabin
*NL*
built
of
light
planks
served
for
a
pilot-house
.
It
contained
a
couch
,
*NL*
two
camp-stools
,
a
loaded
Martini-Henry
leaning
in
one
corner
,
a
tiny
*NL*
table
,
and
the
steering-wheel
.
It
had
a
wide
door
in
front
and
a
broad
*NL*
shutter
at
each
side
.
All
these
were
always
thrown
open
,
of
course
.
I
*NL*
spent
my
days
perched
up
there
on
the
extreme
fore-end
of
that
roof
,
*NL*
before
the
door
.
At
night
I
slept
,
or
tried
to
,
on
the
couch
.
An
*NL*
athletic
black
belonging
to
some
coast
tribe
and
educated
by
my
poor
*NL*
predecessor
,
was
the
helmsman
.
He
sported
a
pair
of
brass
earrings
,
wore
*NL*
a
blue
cloth
wrapper
from
the
waist
to
the
ankles
,
and
thought
all
the
*NL*
world
of
himself
.
He
was
the
most
unstable
kind
of
fool
I
had
ever
seen
.
*NL*
He
steered
with
no
end
of
a
swagger
while
you
were
by
;
but
if
he
lost
*NL*
sight
of
you
,
he
became
instantly
the
prey
of
an
abject
funk
,
and
would
*NL*
let
that
cripple
of
a
steamboat
get
the
upper
hand
of
him
in
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
looking
down
at
the
sounding-pole
,
and
feeling
much
annoyed
to
*NL*
see
at
each
try
a
little
more
of
it
stick
out
of
that
river
,
when
I
saw
*NL*
my
poleman
give
up
on
the
business
suddenly
,
and
stretch
himself
flat
on
*NL*
the
deck
,
without
even
taking
the
trouble
to
haul
his
pole
in
.
He
kept
*NL*
hold
on
it
though
,
and
it
trailed
in
the
water
.
At
the
same
time
the
*NL*
fireman
,
whom
I
could
also
see
below
me
,
sat
down
abruptly
before
his
*NL*
furnace
and
ducked
his
head
.
I
was
amazed
.
Then
I
had
to
look
at
the
*NL*
river
mighty
quick
,
because
there
was
a
snag
in
the
fairway
.
Sticks
,
*NL*
little
sticks
,
were
flying
about
--
thick
:
they
were
whizzing
before
my
*NL*
nose
,
dropping
below
me
,
striking
behind
me
against
my
pilot-house
.
All
*NL*
this
time
the
river
,
the
shore
,
the
woods
,
were
very
quiet
--
perfectly
*NL*
quiet
.
I
could
only
hear
the
heavy
splashing
thump
of
the
stern-wheel
*NL*
and
the
patter
of
these
things
.
We
cleared
the
snag
clumsily
.
Arrows
,
by
*NL*
Jove
!
We
were
being
shot
at
!
I
stepped
in
quickly
to
close
the
shutter
*NL*
on
the
landside
.
That
fool-helmsman
,
his
hands
on
the
spokes
,
was
*NL*
lifting
his
knees
high
,
stamping
his
feet
,
champing
his
mouth
,
like
a
*NL*
reined-in
horse
.
Confound
him
!
And
we
were
staggering
within
ten
feet
of
*NL*
the
bank
.
I
had
to
lean
right
out
to
swing
the
heavy
shutter
,
and
I
saw
*NL*
a
face
amongst
the
leaves
on
the
level
with
my
own
,
looking
at
me
very
*NL*
fierce
and
steady
;
and
then
suddenly
,
as
though
a
veil
had
been
removed
*NL*
from
my
eyes
,
I
made
out
,
deep
in
the
tangled
gloom
,
naked
breasts
,
*NL*
arms
,
legs
,
glaring
eyes
--
the
bush
was
swarming
with
human
limbs
in
*NL*
movement
,
glistening
of
bronze
colour
.
The
twigs
shook
,
swayed
,
and
*NL*
rustled
,
the
arrows
flew
out
of
them
,
and
then
the
shutter
came
to
.
*NL*
`
Steer
her
straight
,
'
I
said
to
the
helmsman
.
He
held
his
head
rigid
,
*NL*
face
forward
;
but
his
eyes
rolled
,
he
kept
on
lifting
and
setting
down
*NL*
his
feet
gently
,
his
mouth
foamed
a
little
.
`
Keep
quiet
!
'
I
said
in
a
*NL*
fury
.
I
might
just
as
well
have
ordered
a
tree
not
to
sway
in
the
wind
.
*NL*
I
darted
out
.
Below
me
there
was
a
great
scuffle
of
feet
on
the
iron
*NL*
deck
;
confused
exclamations
;
a
voice
screamed
,
`
Can
you
turn
back
?
'
*NL*
I
caught
sight
of
a
V-shaped
ripple
on
the
water
ahead
.
What
?
Another
*NL*
snag
!
A
fusillade
burst
out
under
my
feet
.
The
pilgrims
had
opened
with
*NL*
their
Winchesters
,
and
were
simply
squirting
lead
into
that
bush
.
A
*NL*
deuce
of
a
lot
of
smoke
came
up
and
drove
slowly
forward
.
I
swore
at
*NL*
it
.
Now
I
could
n't
see
the
ripple
or
the
snag
either
.
I
stood
in
the
*NL*
doorway
,
peering
,
and
the
arrows
came
in
swarms
.
They
might
have
been
*NL*
poisoned
,
but
they
looked
as
though
they
would
n't
kill
a
cat
.
The
bush
*NL*
began
to
howl
.
Our
wood-cutters
raised
a
warlike
whoop
;
the
report
of
a
*NL*
rifle
just
at
my
back
deafened
me
.
I
glanced
over
my
shoulder
,
and
the
*NL*
pilot-house
was
yet
full
of
noise
and
smoke
when
I
made
a
dash
at
the
*NL*
wheel
.
The
fool-nigger
had
dropped
everything
,
to
throw
the
shutter
*NL*
open
and
let
off
that
Martini-Henry
.
He
stood
before
the
wide
opening
,
*NL*
glaring
,
and
I
yelled
at
him
to
come
back
,
while
I
straightened
the
*NL*
sudden
twist
out
of
that
steamboat
.
There
was
no
room
to
turn
even
if
I
*NL*
had
wanted
to
,
the
snag
was
somewhere
very
near
ahead
in
that
confounded
*NL*
smoke
,
there
was
no
time
to
lose
,
so
I
just
crowded
her
into
the
*NL*
bank
--
right
into
the
bank
,
where
I
knew
the
water
was
deep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
tore
slowly
along
the
overhanging
bushes
in
a
whirl
of
broken
twigs
*NL*
and
flying
leaves
.
The
fusillade
below
stopped
short
,
as
I
had
foreseen
*NL*
it
would
when
the
squirts
got
empty
.
I
threw
my
head
back
to
a
glinting
*NL*
whizz
that
traversed
the
pilot-house
,
in
at
one
shutter-hole
and
out
*NL*
at
the
other
.
Looking
past
that
mad
helmsman
,
who
was
shaking
the
empty
*NL*
rifle
and
yelling
at
the
shore
,
I
saw
vague
forms
of
men
running
bent
*NL*
double
,
leaping
,
gliding
,
distinct
,
incomplete
,
evanescent
.
Something
*NL*
big
appeared
in
the
air
before
the
shutter
,
the
rifle
went
overboard
,
*NL*
and
the
man
stepped
back
swiftly
,
looked
at
me
over
his
shoulder
in
an
*NL*
extraordinary
,
profound
,
familiar
manner
,
and
fell
upon
my
feet
.
The
*NL*
side
of
his
head
hit
the
wheel
twice
,
and
the
end
of
what
appeared
*NL*
a
long
cane
clattered
round
and
knocked
over
a
little
camp-stool
.
It
*NL*
looked
as
though
after
wrenching
that
thing
from
somebody
ashore
he
had
*NL*
lost
his
balance
in
the
effort
.
The
thin
smoke
had
blown
away
,
we
were
*NL*
clear
of
the
snag
,
and
looking
ahead
I
could
see
that
in
another
hundred
*NL*
yards
or
so
I
would
be
free
to
sheer
off
,
away
from
the
bank
;
but
my
*NL*
feet
felt
so
very
warm
and
wet
that
I
had
to
look
down
.
The
man
had
*NL*
rolled
on
his
back
and
stared
straight
up
at
me
;
both
his
hands
clutched
*NL*
that
cane
.
It
was
the
shaft
of
a
spear
that
,
either
thrown
or
lunged
*NL*
through
the
opening
,
had
caught
him
in
the
side
,
just
below
the
ribs
;
*NL*
the
blade
had
gone
in
out
of
sight
,
after
making
a
frightful
gash
;
my
*NL*
shoes
were
full
;
a
pool
of
blood
lay
very
still
,
gleaming
dark-red
under
*NL*
the
wheel
;
his
eyes
shone
with
an
amazing
lustre
.
The
fusillade
burst
*NL*
out
again
.
He
looked
at
me
anxiously
,
gripping
the
spear
like
something
*NL*
precious
,
with
an
air
of
being
afraid
I
would
try
to
take
it
away
from
*NL*
him
.
I
had
to
make
an
effort
to
free
my
eyes
from
his
gaze
and
attend
*NL*
to
the
steering
.
With
one
hand
I
felt
above
my
head
for
the
line
of
*NL*
the
steam
whistle
,
and
jerked
out
screech
after
screech
hurriedly
.
The
*NL*
tumult
of
angry
and
warlike
yells
was
checked
instantly
,
and
then
from
*NL*
the
depths
of
the
woods
went
out
such
a
tremulous
and
prolonged
wail
of
*NL*
mournful
fear
and
utter
despair
as
may
be
imagined
to
follow
the
flight
*NL*
of
the
last
hope
from
the
earth
.
There
was
a
great
commotion
in
the
*NL*
bush
;
the
shower
of
arrows
stopped
,
a
few
dropping
shots
rang
out
*NL*
sharply
--
then
silence
,
in
which
the
languid
beat
of
the
stern-wheel
came
*NL*
plainly
to
my
ears
.
I
put
the
helm
hard
a-starboard
at
the
moment
when
*NL*
the
pilgrim
in
pink
pyjamas
,
very
hot
and
agitated
,
appeared
in
the
*NL*
doorway
.
`
The
manager
sends
me
--
'
he
began
in
an
official
tone
,
and
*NL*
stopped
short
.
`
Good
God
!
'
he
said
,
glaring
at
the
wounded
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
two
whites
stood
over
him
,
and
his
lustrous
and
inquiring
glance
*NL*
enveloped
us
both
.
I
declare
it
looked
as
though
he
would
presently
put
*NL*
to
us
some
questions
in
an
understandable
language
;
but
he
died
without
*NL*
uttering
a
sound
,
without
moving
a
limb
,
without
twitching
a
muscle
.
*NL*
Only
in
the
very
last
moment
,
as
though
in
response
to
some
sign
we
*NL*
could
not
see
,
to
some
whisper
we
could
not
hear
,
he
frowned
heavily
,
*NL*
and
that
frown
gave
to
his
black
death-mask
an
inconceivably
sombre
,
*NL*
brooding
,
and
menacing
expression
.
The
lustre
of
inquiring
glance
faded
*NL*
swiftly
into
vacant
glassiness
.
`
Can
you
steer
?
'
I
asked
the
agent
*NL*
eagerly
.
He
looked
very
dubious
;
but
I
made
a
grab
at
his
arm
,
and
he
*NL*
understood
at
once
I
meant
him
to
steer
whether
or
no
.
To
tell
you
*NL*
the
truth
,
I
was
morbidly
anxious
to
change
my
shoes
and
socks
.
`
He
is
*NL*
dead
,
'
murmured
the
fellow
,
immensely
impressed
.
`
No
doubt
about
it
,
'
*NL*
said
I
,
tugging
like
mad
at
the
shoe-laces
.
`
And
by
the
way
,
I
suppose
*NL*
Mr.
Kurtz
is
dead
as
well
by
this
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
moment
that
was
the
dominant
thought
.
There
was
a
sense
of
*NL*
extreme
disappointment
,
as
though
I
had
found
out
I
had
been
striving
*NL*
after
something
altogether
without
a
substance
.
I
could
n't
have
been
*NL*
more
disgusted
if
I
had
travelled
all
this
way
for
the
sole
purpose
of
*NL*
talking
with
Mr.
Kurtz
.
Talking
with
...
I
flung
one
shoe
overboard
,
*NL*
and
became
aware
that
that
was
exactly
what
I
had
been
looking
forward
*NL*
to
--
a
talk
with
Kurtz
.
I
made
the
strange
discovery
that
I
had
never
*NL*
imagined
him
as
doing
,
you
know
,
but
as
discoursing
.
I
did
n't
say
to
*NL*
myself
,
`
Now
I
will
never
see
him
,
'
or
`
Now
I
will
never
shake
him
by
*NL*
the
hand
,
'
but
,
`
Now
I
will
never
hear
him
.
'
The
man
presented
himself
*NL*
as
a
voice
.
Not
of
course
that
I
did
not
connect
him
with
some
sort
of
*NL*
action
.
Had
n't
I
been
told
in
all
the
tones
of
jealousy
and
admiration
*NL*
that
he
had
collected
,
bartered
,
swindled
,
or
stolen
more
ivory
than
all
*NL*
the
other
agents
together
?
That
was
not
the
point
.
The
point
was
in
his
*NL*
being
a
gifted
creature
,
and
that
of
all
his
gifts
the
one
that
stood
*NL*
out
preeminently
,
that
carried
with
it
a
sense
of
real
presence
,
was
his
*NL*
ability
to
talk
,
his
words
--
the
gift
of
expression
,
the
bewildering
,
*NL*
the
illuminating
,
the
most
exalted
and
the
most
contemptible
,
the
*NL*
pulsating
stream
of
light
,
or
the
deceitful
flow
from
the
heart
of
an
*NL*
impenetrable
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
other
shoe
went
flying
unto
the
devil-god
of
that
river
.
I
thought
,
*NL*
`
By
Jove
!
it
's
all
over
.
We
are
too
late
;
he
has
vanished
--
the
gift
has
*NL*
vanished
,
by
means
of
some
spear
,
arrow
,
or
club
.
I
will
never
hear
that
*NL*
chap
speak
after
all
'
--
and
my
sorrow
had
a
startling
extravagance
of
*NL*
emotion
,
even
such
as
I
had
noticed
in
the
howling
sorrow
of
these
*NL*
savages
in
the
bush
.
I
could
n't
have
felt
more
of
lonely
desolation
*NL*
somehow
,
had
I
been
robbed
of
a
belief
or
had
missed
my
destiny
in
*NL*
life
...
Why
do
you
sigh
in
this
beastly
way
,
somebody
?
Absurd
?
Well
,
*NL*
absurd
.
Good
Lord
!
must
n't
a
man
ever
--
Here
,
give
me
some
tobacco
.
''
...
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
of
profound
stillness
,
then
a
match
flared
,
and
*NL*
Marlow
's
lean
face
appeared
,
worn
,
hollow
,
with
downward
folds
and
*NL*
dropped
eyelids
,
with
an
aspect
of
concentrated
attention
;
and
as
he
*NL*
took
vigorous
draws
at
his
pipe
,
it
seemed
to
retreat
and
advance
out
of
*NL*
the
night
in
the
regular
flicker
of
tiny
flame
.
The
match
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Absurd
!
''
he
cried
.
``
This
is
the
worst
of
trying
to
tell
...
Here
*NL*
you
all
are
,
each
moored
with
two
good
addresses
,
like
a
hulk
with
*NL*
two
anchors
,
a
butcher
round
one
corner
,
a
policeman
round
another
,
*NL*
excellent
appetites
,
and
temperature
normal
--
you
hear
--
normal
from
*NL*
year
's
end
to
year
's
end
.
And
you
say
,
Absurd
!
Absurd
be
--
exploded
!
*NL*
Absurd
!
My
dear
boys
,
what
can
you
expect
from
a
man
who
out
of
sheer
*NL*
nervousness
had
just
flung
overboard
a
pair
of
new
shoes
!
Now
I
think
of
*NL*
it
,
it
is
amazing
I
did
not
shed
tears
.
I
am
,
upon
the
whole
,
proud
*NL*
of
my
fortitude
.
I
was
cut
to
the
quick
at
the
idea
of
having
lost
the
*NL*
inestimable
privilege
of
listening
to
the
gifted
Kurtz
.
Of
course
I
*NL*
was
wrong
.
The
privilege
was
waiting
for
me
.
Oh
,
yes
,
I
heard
more
than
*NL*
enough
.
And
I
was
right
,
too
.
A
voice
.
He
was
very
little
more
than
a
*NL*
voice
.
And
I
heard
--
him
--
it
--
this
voice
--
other
voices
--
all
of
them
were
*NL*
so
little
more
than
voices
--
and
the
memory
of
that
time
itself
lingers
*NL*
around
me
,
impalpable
,
like
a
dying
vibration
of
one
immense
jabber
,
*NL*
silly
,
atrocious
,
sordid
,
savage
,
or
simply
mean
,
without
any
kind
of
*NL*
sense
.
Voices
,
voices
--
even
the
girl
herself
--
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
laid
the
ghost
of
his
gifts
at
last
with
a
lie
,
''
he
began
,
suddenly
.
*NL*
``
Girl
!
What
?
Did
I
mention
a
girl
?
Oh
,
she
is
out
of
it
--
completely
.
*NL*
They
--
the
women
,
I
mean
--
are
out
of
it
--
should
be
out
of
it
.
We
must
*NL*
help
them
to
stay
in
that
beautiful
world
of
their
own
,
lest
ours
*NL*
gets
worse
.
Oh
,
she
had
to
be
out
of
it
.
You
should
have
heard
the
*NL*
disinterred
body
of
Mr.
Kurtz
saying
,
`
My
Intended
.
'
You
would
have
*NL*
perceived
directly
then
how
completely
she
was
out
of
it
.
And
the
lofty
*NL*
frontal
bone
of
Mr.
Kurtz
!
They
say
the
hair
goes
on
growing
sometimes
,
*NL*
but
this
--
ah
--
specimen
,
was
impressively
bald
.
The
wilderness
had
*NL*
patted
him
on
the
head
,
and
,
behold
,
it
was
like
a
ball
--
an
ivory
ball
;
*NL*
it
had
caressed
him
,
and
--
lo
!
--
he
had
withered
;
it
had
taken
him
,
loved
*NL*
him
,
embraced
him
,
got
into
his
veins
,
consumed
his
flesh
,
and
sealed
*NL*
his
soul
to
its
own
by
the
inconceivable
ceremonies
of
some
devilish
*NL*
initiation
.
He
was
its
spoiled
and
pampered
favourite
.
Ivory
?
I
should
*NL*
think
so
.
Heaps
of
it
,
stacks
of
it
.
The
old
mud
shanty
was
bursting
*NL*
with
it
.
You
would
think
there
was
not
a
single
tusk
left
either
above
*NL*
or
below
the
ground
in
the
whole
country
.
`
Mostly
fossil
,
'
the
manager
*NL*
had
remarked
,
disparagingly
.
It
was
no
more
fossil
than
I
am
;
but
they
*NL*
call
it
fossil
when
it
is
dug
up
.
It
appears
these
niggers
do
bury
the
*NL*
tusks
sometimes
--
but
evidently
they
could
n't
bury
this
parcel
deep
*NL*
enough
to
save
the
gifted
Mr.
Kurtz
from
his
fate
.
We
filled
the
*NL*
steamboat
with
it
,
and
had
to
pile
a
lot
on
the
deck
.
Thus
he
could
*NL*
see
and
enjoy
as
long
as
he
could
see
,
because
the
appreciation
of
this
*NL*
favour
had
remained
with
him
to
the
last
.
You
should
have
heard
him
say
,
*NL*
`
My
ivory
.
'
Oh
,
yes
,
I
heard
him
.
`
My
Intended
,
my
ivory
,
my
station
,
*NL*
my
river
,
my
--
'
everything
belonged
to
him
.
It
made
me
hold
my
breath
*NL*
in
expectation
of
hearing
the
wilderness
burst
into
a
prodigious
peal
*NL*
of
laughter
that
would
shake
the
fixed
stars
in
their
places
.
Everything
*NL*
belonged
to
him
--
but
that
was
a
trifle
.
The
thing
was
to
know
what
he
*NL*
belonged
to
,
how
many
powers
of
darkness
claimed
him
for
their
own
.
That
*NL*
was
the
reflection
that
made
you
creepy
all
over
.
It
was
impossible
--
it
*NL*
was
not
good
for
one
either
--
trying
to
imagine
.
He
had
taken
a
high
seat
*NL*
amongst
the
devils
of
the
land
--
I
mean
literally
.
You
ca
n't
understand
.
*NL*
How
could
you
?
--
with
solid
pavement
under
your
feet
,
surrounded
by
kind
*NL*
neighbours
ready
to
cheer
you
or
to
fall
on
you
,
stepping
delicately
*NL*
between
the
butcher
and
the
policeman
,
in
the
holy
terror
of
scandal
and
*NL*
gallows
and
lunatic
asylums
--
how
can
you
imagine
what
particular
region
*NL*
of
the
first
ages
a
man
's
untrammelled
feet
may
take
him
into
by
the
*NL*
way
of
solitude
--
utter
solitude
without
a
policeman
--
by
the
way
of
*NL*
silence
--
utter
silence
,
where
no
warning
voice
of
a
kind
neighbour
can
*NL*
be
heard
whispering
of
public
opinion
?
These
little
things
make
all
the
*NL*
great
difference
.
When
they
are
gone
you
must
fall
back
upon
your
own
*NL*
innate
strength
,
upon
your
own
capacity
for
faithfulness
.
Of
course
you
*NL*
may
be
too
much
of
a
fool
to
go
wrong
--
too
dull
even
to
know
you
are
*NL*
being
assaulted
by
the
powers
of
darkness
.
I
take
it
,
no
fool
ever
made
*NL*
a
bargain
for
his
soul
with
the
devil
;
the
fool
is
too
much
of
a
fool
,
*NL*
or
the
devil
too
much
of
a
devil
--
I
do
n't
know
which
.
Or
you
may
be
such
*NL*
a
thunderingly
exalted
creature
as
to
be
altogether
deaf
and
blind
to
*NL*
anything
but
heavenly
sights
and
sounds
.
Then
the
earth
for
you
is
only
*NL*
a
standing
place
--
and
whether
to
be
like
this
is
your
loss
or
your
gain
*NL*
I
wo
n't
pretend
to
say
.
But
most
of
us
are
neither
one
nor
the
other
.
*NL*
The
earth
for
us
is
a
place
to
live
in
,
where
we
must
put
up
with
*NL*
sights
,
with
sounds
,
with
smells
,
too
,
by
Jove
!
--
breathe
dead
hippo
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
,
and
not
be
contaminated
.
And
there
,
do
n't
you
see
?
*NL*
Your
strength
comes
in
,
the
faith
in
your
ability
for
the
digging
of
*NL*
unostentatious
holes
to
bury
the
stuff
in
--
your
power
of
devotion
,
*NL*
not
to
yourself
,
but
to
an
obscure
,
back-breaking
business
.
And
that
's
*NL*
difficult
enough
.
Mind
,
I
am
not
trying
to
excuse
or
even
explain
--
I
am
*NL*
trying
to
account
to
myself
for
--
for
--
Mr.
Kurtz
--
for
the
shade
of
Mr.
*NL*
Kurtz
.
This
initiated
wraith
from
the
back
of
Nowhere
honoured
me
with
*NL*
its
amazing
confidence
before
it
vanished
altogether
.
This
was
because
*NL*
it
could
speak
English
to
me
.
The
original
Kurtz
had
been
educated
*NL*
partly
in
England
,
and
--
as
he
was
good
enough
to
say
himself
--
his
*NL*
sympathies
were
in
the
right
place
.
His
mother
was
half-English
,
his
*NL*
father
was
half-French
.
All
Europe
contributed
to
the
making
of
Kurtz
;
*NL*
and
by
and
by
I
learned
that
,
most
appropriately
,
the
International
*NL*
Society
for
the
Suppression
of
Savage
Customs
had
intrusted
him
with
the
*NL*
making
of
a
report
,
for
its
future
guidance
.
And
he
had
written
it
,
too
.
*NL*
I
've
seen
it
.
I
've
read
it
.
It
was
eloquent
,
vibrating
with
eloquence
,
*NL*
but
too
high-strung
,
I
think
.
Seventeen
pages
of
close
writing
he
had
*NL*
found
time
for
!
But
this
must
have
been
before
his
--
let
us
say
--
nerves
,
*NL*
went
wrong
,
and
caused
him
to
preside
at
certain
midnight
dances
ending
*NL*
with
unspeakable
rites
,
which
--
as
far
as
I
reluctantly
gathered
*NL*
from
what
I
heard
at
various
times
--
were
offered
up
to
him
--
do
you
*NL*
understand
?
--
to
Mr.
Kurtz
himself
.
But
it
was
a
beautiful
piece
*NL*
of
writing
.
The
opening
paragraph
,
however
,
in
the
light
of
later
*NL*
information
,
strikes
me
now
as
ominous
.
He
began
with
the
argument
*NL*
that
we
whites
,
from
the
point
of
development
we
had
arrived
at
,
`
must
*NL*
necessarily
appear
to
them
-LSB-
savages
-RSB-
in
the
nature
of
supernatural
*NL*
beings
--
we
approach
them
with
the
might
of
a
deity
,
'
and
so
on
,
and
so
*NL*
on
.
`
By
the
simple
exercise
of
our
will
we
can
exert
a
power
for
good
*NL*
practically
unbounded
,
'
etc.
,
etc.
.
From
that
point
he
soared
and
took
me
*NL*
with
him
.
The
peroration
was
magnificent
,
though
difficult
to
remember
,
*NL*
you
know
.
It
gave
me
the
notion
of
an
exotic
Immensity
ruled
by
an
*NL*
august
Benevolence
.
It
made
me
tingle
with
enthusiasm
.
This
was
the
*NL*
unbounded
power
of
eloquence
--
of
words
--
of
burning
noble
words
.
There
*NL*
were
no
practical
hints
to
interrupt
the
magic
current
of
phrases
,
*NL*
unless
a
kind
of
note
at
the
foot
of
the
last
page
,
scrawled
evidently
*NL*
much
later
,
in
an
unsteady
hand
,
may
be
regarded
as
the
exposition
of
*NL*
a
method
.
It
was
very
simple
,
and
at
the
end
of
that
moving
appeal
to
*NL*
every
altruistic
sentiment
it
blazed
at
you
,
luminous
and
terrifying
,
*NL*
like
a
flash
of
lightning
in
a
serene
sky
:
`
Exterminate
all
the
brutes
!
'
*NL*
The
curious
part
was
that
he
had
apparently
forgotten
all
about
that
*NL*
valuable
postscriptum
,
because
,
later
on
,
when
he
in
a
sense
came
to
*NL*
himself
,
he
repeatedly
entreated
me
to
take
good
care
of
`
my
pamphlet
'
*NL*
-LRB-
he
called
it
-RRB-
,
as
it
was
sure
to
have
in
the
future
a
good
influence
*NL*
upon
his
career
.
I
had
full
information
about
all
these
things
,
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
as
it
turned
out
,
I
was
to
have
the
care
of
his
memory
.
I
've
*NL*
done
enough
for
it
to
give
me
the
indisputable
right
to
lay
it
,
if
I
*NL*
choose
,
for
an
everlasting
rest
in
the
dust-bin
of
progress
,
amongst
*NL*
all
the
sweepings
and
,
figuratively
speaking
,
all
the
dead
cats
of
*NL*
civilization
.
But
then
,
you
see
,
I
ca
n't
choose
.
He
wo
n't
be
forgotten
.
*NL*
Whatever
he
was
,
he
was
not
common
.
He
had
the
power
to
charm
or
*NL*
frighten
rudimentary
souls
into
an
aggravated
witch-dance
in
his
*NL*
honour
;
he
could
also
fill
the
small
souls
of
the
pilgrims
with
bitter
*NL*
misgivings
:
he
had
one
devoted
friend
at
least
,
and
he
had
conquered
*NL*
one
soul
in
the
world
that
was
neither
rudimentary
nor
tainted
with
*NL*
self-seeking
.
No
;
I
ca
n't
forget
him
,
though
I
am
not
prepared
to
affirm
*NL*
the
fellow
was
exactly
worth
the
life
we
lost
in
getting
to
him
.
I
*NL*
missed
my
late
helmsman
awfully
--
I
missed
him
even
while
his
body
*NL*
was
still
lying
in
the
pilot-house
.
Perhaps
you
will
think
it
passing
*NL*
strange
this
regret
for
a
savage
who
was
no
more
account
than
a
grain
of
*NL*
sand
in
a
black
Sahara
.
Well
,
do
n't
you
see
,
he
had
done
something
,
he
*NL*
had
steered
;
for
months
I
had
him
at
my
back
--
a
help
--
an
instrument
.
It
*NL*
was
a
kind
of
partnership
.
He
steered
for
me
--
I
had
to
look
after
him
,
I
*NL*
worried
about
his
deficiencies
,
and
thus
a
subtle
bond
had
been
created
,
*NL*
of
which
I
only
became
aware
when
it
was
suddenly
broken
.
And
the
*NL*
intimate
profundity
of
that
look
he
gave
me
when
he
received
his
hurt
*NL*
remains
to
this
day
in
my
memory
--
like
a
claim
of
distant
kinship
*NL*
affirmed
in
a
supreme
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fool
!
If
he
had
only
left
that
shutter
alone
.
He
had
no
restraint
,
*NL*
no
restraint
--
just
like
Kurtz
--
a
tree
swayed
by
the
wind
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
I
had
put
on
a
dry
pair
of
slippers
,
I
dragged
him
out
,
after
first
*NL*
jerking
the
spear
out
of
his
side
,
which
operation
I
confess
I
performed
*NL*
with
my
eyes
shut
tight
.
His
heels
leaped
together
over
the
little
*NL*
doorstep
;
his
shoulders
were
pressed
to
my
breast
;
I
hugged
him
from
*NL*
behind
desperately
.
Oh
!
he
was
heavy
,
heavy
;
heavier
than
any
man
on
*NL*
earth
,
I
should
imagine
.
Then
without
more
ado
I
tipped
him
overboard
.
*NL*
The
current
snatched
him
as
though
he
had
been
a
wisp
of
grass
,
and
I
*NL*
saw
the
body
roll
over
twice
before
I
lost
sight
of
it
for
ever
.
All
the
*NL*
pilgrims
and
the
manager
were
then
congregated
on
the
awning-deck
*NL*
about
the
pilot-house
,
chattering
at
each
other
like
a
flock
of
excited
*NL*
magpies
,
and
there
was
a
scandalized
murmur
at
my
heartless
promptitude
.
*NL*
What
they
wanted
to
keep
that
body
hanging
about
for
I
ca
n't
guess
.
*NL*
Embalm
it
,
maybe
.
But
I
had
also
heard
another
,
and
a
very
ominous
,
*NL*
murmur
on
the
deck
below
.
My
friends
the
wood-cutters
were
likewise
*NL*
scandalized
,
and
with
a
better
show
of
reason
--
though
I
admit
that
the
*NL*
reason
itself
was
quite
inadmissible
.
Oh
,
quite
!
I
had
made
up
my
mind
*NL*
that
if
my
late
helmsman
was
to
be
eaten
,
the
fishes
alone
should
have
*NL*
him
.
He
had
been
a
very
second-rate
helmsman
while
alive
,
but
now
he
was
*NL*
dead
he
might
have
become
a
first-class
temptation
,
and
possibly
cause
*NL*
some
startling
trouble
.
Besides
,
I
was
anxious
to
take
the
wheel
,
the
*NL*
man
in
pink
pyjamas
showing
himself
a
hopeless
duffer
at
the
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
I
did
directly
the
simple
funeral
was
over
.
We
were
going
*NL*
half-speed
,
keeping
right
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
,
and
I
listened
*NL*
to
the
talk
about
me
.
They
had
given
up
Kurtz
,
they
had
given
up
the
*NL*
station
;
Kurtz
was
dead
,
and
the
station
had
been
burnt
--
and
so
on
--
and
*NL*
so
on
.
The
red-haired
pilgrim
was
beside
himself
with
the
thought
that
*NL*
at
least
this
poor
Kurtz
had
been
properly
avenged
.
`
Say
!
We
must
have
*NL*
made
a
glorious
slaughter
of
them
in
the
bush
.
Eh
?
What
do
you
think
?
*NL*
Say
?
'
He
positively
danced
,
the
bloodthirsty
little
gingery
beggar
.
*NL*
And
he
had
nearly
fainted
when
he
saw
the
wounded
man
!
I
could
not
help
*NL*
saying
,
`
You
made
a
glorious
lot
of
smoke
,
anyhow
.
'
I
had
seen
,
from
the
*NL*
way
the
tops
of
the
bushes
rustled
and
flew
,
that
almost
all
the
shots
*NL*
had
gone
too
high
.
You
ca
n't
hit
anything
unless
you
take
aim
and
fire
*NL*
from
the
shoulder
;
but
these
chaps
fired
from
the
hip
with
their
eyes
*NL*
shut
.
The
retreat
,
I
maintained
--
and
I
was
right
--
was
caused
by
the
*NL*
screeching
of
the
steam
whistle
.
Upon
this
they
forgot
Kurtz
,
and
began
*NL*
to
howl
at
me
with
indignant
protests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
manager
stood
by
the
wheel
murmuring
confidentially
about
the
*NL*
necessity
of
getting
well
away
down
the
river
before
dark
at
all
events
,
*NL*
when
I
saw
in
the
distance
a
clearing
on
the
riverside
and
the
outlines
*NL*
of
some
sort
of
building
.
`
What
's
this
?
'
I
asked
.
He
clapped
his
hands
*NL*
in
wonder
.
`
The
station
!
'
he
cried
.
I
edged
in
at
once
,
still
going
*NL*
half-speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Through
my
glasses
I
saw
the
slope
of
a
hill
interspersed
with
rare
*NL*
trees
and
perfectly
free
from
undergrowth
.
A
long
decaying
building
on
*NL*
the
summit
was
half
buried
in
the
high
grass
;
the
large
holes
in
the
*NL*
peaked
roof
gaped
black
from
afar
;
the
jungle
and
the
woods
made
a
*NL*
background
.
There
was
no
enclosure
or
fence
of
any
kind
;
but
there
had
*NL*
been
one
apparently
,
for
near
the
house
half-a-dozen
slim
posts
remained
*NL*
in
a
row
,
roughly
trimmed
,
and
with
their
upper
ends
ornamented
with
*NL*
round
carved
balls
.
The
rails
,
or
whatever
there
had
been
between
,
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
Of
course
the
forest
surrounded
all
that
.
The
river-bank
*NL*
was
clear
,
and
on
the
waterside
I
saw
a
white
man
under
a
hat
like
a
*NL*
cart-wheel
beckoning
persistently
with
his
whole
arm
.
Examining
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
forest
above
and
below
,
I
was
almost
certain
I
could
see
*NL*
movements
--
human
forms
gliding
here
and
there
.
I
steamed
past
prudently
,
*NL*
then
stopped
the
engines
and
let
her
drift
down
.
The
man
on
the
shore
*NL*
began
to
shout
,
urging
us
to
land
.
`
We
have
been
attacked
,
'
screamed
*NL*
the
manager
.
'
I
know
--
I
know
.
It
's
all
right
,
'
yelled
back
the
other
,
as
*NL*
cheerful
as
you
please
.
`
Come
along
.
It
's
all
right
.
I
am
glad
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
aspect
reminded
me
of
something
I
had
seen
--
something
funny
I
had
*NL*
seen
somewhere
.
As
I
manoeuvred
to
get
alongside
,
I
was
asking
myself
,
*NL*
`
What
does
this
fellow
look
like
?
'
Suddenly
I
got
it
.
He
looked
like
*NL*
a
harlequin
.
His
clothes
had
been
made
of
some
stuff
that
was
brown
*NL*
holland
probably
,
but
it
was
covered
with
patches
all
over
,
with
bright
*NL*
patches
,
blue
,
red
,
and
yellow
--
patches
on
the
back
,
patches
on
the
*NL*
front
,
patches
on
elbows
,
on
knees
;
coloured
binding
around
his
jacket
,
*NL*
scarlet
edging
at
the
bottom
of
his
trousers
;
and
the
sunshine
made
him
*NL*
look
extremely
gay
and
wonderfully
neat
withal
,
because
you
could
see
*NL*
how
beautifully
all
this
patching
had
been
done
.
A
beardless
,
boyish
*NL*
face
,
very
fair
,
no
features
to
speak
of
,
nose
peeling
,
little
blue
*NL*
eyes
,
smiles
and
frowns
chasing
each
other
over
that
open
countenance
*NL*
like
sunshine
and
shadow
on
a
wind-swept
plain
.
`
Look
out
,
captain
!
'
he
*NL*
cried
;
`
there
's
a
snag
lodged
in
here
last
night
.
'
What
!
Another
snag
?
I
*NL*
confess
I
swore
shamefully
.
I
had
nearly
holed
my
cripple
,
to
finish
off
*NL*
that
charming
trip
.
The
harlequin
on
the
bank
turned
his
little
pug-nose
*NL*
up
to
me
.
`
You
English
?
'
he
asked
,
all
smiles
.
`
Are
you
?
'
I
shouted
from
*NL*
the
wheel
.
The
smiles
vanished
,
and
he
shook
his
head
as
if
sorry
for
*NL*
my
disappointment
.
Then
he
brightened
up
.
`
Never
mind
!
'
he
cried
*NL*
encouragingly
.
`
Are
we
in
time
?
'
I
asked
.
`
He
is
up
there
,
'
he
replied
,
*NL*
with
a
toss
of
the
head
up
the
hill
,
and
becoming
gloomy
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
.
His
face
was
like
the
autumn
sky
,
overcast
one
moment
and
bright
*NL*
the
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
manager
,
escorted
by
the
pilgrims
,
all
of
them
armed
to
the
*NL*
teeth
,
had
gone
to
the
house
this
chap
came
on
board
.
'
I
say
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
this
.
These
natives
are
in
the
bush
,
'
I
said
.
He
assured
me
*NL*
earnestly
it
was
all
right
.
`
They
are
simple
people
,
'
he
added
;
`
well
,
*NL*
I
am
glad
you
came
.
It
took
me
all
my
time
to
keep
them
off
.
'
`
But
you
*NL*
said
it
was
all
right
,
'
I
cried
.
`
Oh
,
they
meant
no
harm
,
'
he
said
;
and
*NL*
as
I
stared
he
corrected
himself
,
`
Not
exactly
.
'
Then
vivaciously
,
`
My
*NL*
faith
,
your
pilot-house
wants
a
clean-up
!
'
In
the
next
breath
he
advised
*NL*
me
to
keep
enough
steam
on
the
boiler
to
blow
the
whistle
in
case
of
any
*NL*
trouble
.
`
One
good
screech
will
do
more
for
you
than
all
your
rifles
.
*NL*
They
are
simple
people
,
'
he
repeated
.
He
rattled
away
at
such
a
rate
*NL*
he
quite
overwhelmed
me
.
He
seemed
to
be
trying
to
make
up
for
lots
of
*NL*
silence
,
and
actually
hinted
,
laughing
,
that
such
was
the
case
.
`
Do
n't
*NL*
you
talk
with
Mr.
Kurtz
?
'
I
said
.
`
You
do
n't
talk
with
that
man
--
you
*NL*
listen
to
him
,
'
he
exclaimed
with
severe
exaltation
.
`
But
now
--
'
He
*NL*
waved
his
arm
,
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
was
in
the
uttermost
*NL*
depths
of
despondency
.
In
a
moment
he
came
up
again
with
a
jump
,
*NL*
possessed
himself
of
both
my
hands
,
shook
them
continuously
,
while
he
*NL*
gabbled
:
`
Brother
sailor
...
honour
...
pleasure
...
delight
...
*NL*
introduce
myself
...
Russian
...
son
of
an
arch-priest
...
*NL*
Government
of
Tambov
...
What
?
Tobacco
!
English
tobacco
;
the
excellent
*NL*
English
tobacco
!
Now
,
that
's
brotherly
.
Smoke
?
Where
's
a
sailor
that
*NL*
does
not
smoke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pipe
soothed
him
,
and
gradually
I
made
out
he
had
run
away
from
*NL*
school
,
had
gone
to
sea
in
a
Russian
ship
;
ran
away
again
;
served
some
*NL*
time
in
English
ships
;
was
now
reconciled
with
the
arch-priest
.
He
made
*NL*
a
point
of
that
.
`
But
when
one
is
young
one
must
see
things
,
gather
*NL*
experience
,
ideas
;
enlarge
the
mind
.
'
`
Here
!
'
I
interrupted
.
`
You
*NL*
can
never
tell
!
Here
I
met
Mr.
Kurtz
,
'
he
said
,
youthfully
solemn
and
*NL*
reproachful
.
I
held
my
tongue
after
that
.
It
appears
he
had
persuaded
a
*NL*
Dutch
trading-house
on
the
coast
to
fit
him
out
with
stores
and
goods
,
*NL*
and
had
started
for
the
interior
with
a
light
heart
and
no
more
idea
of
*NL*
what
would
happen
to
him
than
a
baby
.
He
had
been
wandering
about
that
*NL*
river
for
nearly
two
years
alone
,
cut
off
from
everybody
and
everything
.
*NL*
'
I
am
not
so
young
as
I
look
.
I
am
twenty-five
,
'
he
said
.
`
At
first
old
*NL*
Van
Shuyten
would
tell
me
to
go
to
the
devil
,
'
he
narrated
with
keen
*NL*
enjoyment
;
`
but
I
stuck
to
him
,
and
talked
and
talked
,
till
at
last
he
*NL*
got
afraid
I
would
talk
the
hind-leg
off
his
favourite
dog
,
so
he
gave
*NL*
me
some
cheap
things
and
a
few
guns
,
and
told
me
he
hoped
he
would
never
*NL*
see
my
face
again
.
Good
old
Dutchman
,
Van
Shuyten
.
I
've
sent
him
one
*NL*
small
lot
of
ivory
a
year
ago
,
so
that
he
ca
n't
call
me
a
little
thief
*NL*
when
I
get
back
.
I
hope
he
got
it
.
And
for
the
rest
I
do
n't
care
.
I
had
*NL*
some
wood
stacked
for
you
.
That
was
my
old
house
.
Did
you
see
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
him
Towson
's
book
.
He
made
as
though
he
would
kiss
me
,
but
*NL*
restrained
himself
.
`
The
only
book
I
had
left
,
and
I
thought
I
had
lost
*NL*
it
,
'
he
said
,
looking
at
it
ecstatically
.
`
So
many
accidents
happen
to
*NL*
a
man
going
about
alone
,
you
know
.
Canoes
get
upset
sometimes
--
and
*NL*
sometimes
you
've
got
to
clear
out
so
quick
when
the
people
get
angry
.
'
*NL*
He
thumbed
the
pages
.
`
You
made
notes
in
Russian
?
'
I
asked
.
He
nodded
.
*NL*
'
I
thought
they
were
written
in
cipher
,
'
I
said
.
He
laughed
,
then
became
*NL*
serious
.
'
I
had
lots
of
trouble
to
keep
these
people
off
,
'
he
said
.
*NL*
`
Did
they
want
to
kill
you
?
'
I
asked
.
`
Oh
,
no
!
'
he
cried
,
and
checked
*NL*
himself
.
`
Why
did
they
attack
us
?
'
I
pursued
.
He
hesitated
,
then
*NL*
said
shamefacedly
,
`
They
do
n't
want
him
to
go
.
'
`
Do
n't
they
?
'
I
said
*NL*
curiously
.
He
nodded
a
nod
full
of
mystery
and
wisdom
.
'
I
tell
you
,
'
he
*NL*
cried
,
`
this
man
has
enlarged
my
mind
.
'
He
opened
his
arms
wide
,
staring
*NL*
at
me
with
his
little
blue
eyes
that
were
perfectly
round
.

III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
looked
at
him
,
lost
in
astonishment
.
There
he
was
before
me
,
in
*NL*
motley
,
as
though
he
had
absconded
from
a
troupe
of
mimes
,
enthusiastic
,
*NL*
fabulous
.
His
very
existence
was
improbable
,
inexplicable
,
and
*NL*
altogether
bewildering
.
He
was
an
insoluble
problem
.
It
was
*NL*
inconceivable
how
he
had
existed
,
how
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
so
*NL*
far
,
how
he
had
managed
to
remain
--
why
he
did
not
instantly
disappear
.
*NL*
'
I
went
a
little
farther
,
'
he
said
,
`
then
still
a
little
farther
--
till
*NL*
I
had
gone
so
far
that
I
do
n't
know
how
I
'll
ever
get
back
.
Never
mind
.
*NL*
Plenty
time
.
I
can
manage
.
You
take
Kurtz
away
quick
--
quick
--
I
tell
*NL*
you
.
'
The
glamour
of
youth
enveloped
his
parti-coloured
rags
,
his
*NL*
destitution
,
his
loneliness
,
the
essential
desolation
of
his
futile
*NL*
wanderings
.
For
months
--
for
years
--
his
life
had
n't
been
worth
a
day
's
*NL*
purchase
;
and
there
he
was
gallantly
,
thoughtlessly
alive
,
to
all
*NL*
appearances
indestructible
solely
by
the
virtue
of
his
few
years
and
*NL*
of
his
unreflecting
audacity
.
I
was
seduced
into
something
like
*NL*
admiration
--
like
envy
.
Glamour
urged
him
on
,
glamour
kept
him
*NL*
unscathed
.
He
surely
wanted
nothing
from
the
wilderness
but
space
to
*NL*
breathe
in
and
to
push
on
through
.
His
need
was
to
exist
,
and
to
move
*NL*
onwards
at
the
greatest
possible
risk
,
and
with
a
maximum
of
privation
.
*NL*
If
the
absolutely
pure
,
uncalculating
,
unpractical
spirit
of
adventure
*NL*
had
ever
ruled
a
human
being
,
it
ruled
this
bepatched
youth
.
I
almost
*NL*
envied
him
the
possession
of
this
modest
and
clear
flame
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
have
consumed
all
thought
of
self
so
completely
,
that
even
while
he
*NL*
was
talking
to
you
,
you
forgot
that
it
was
he
--
the
man
before
your
*NL*
eyes
--
who
had
gone
through
these
things
.
I
did
not
envy
him
his
devotion
*NL*
to
Kurtz
,
though
.
He
had
not
meditated
over
it
.
It
came
to
him
,
and
*NL*
he
accepted
it
with
a
sort
of
eager
fatalism
.
I
must
say
that
to
me
it
*NL*
appeared
about
the
most
dangerous
thing
in
every
way
he
had
come
upon
so
*NL*
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
had
come
together
unavoidably
,
like
two
ships
becalmed
near
*NL*
each
other
,
and
lay
rubbing
sides
at
last
.
I
suppose
Kurtz
wanted
an
*NL*
audience
,
because
on
a
certain
occasion
,
when
encamped
in
the
forest
,
*NL*
they
had
talked
all
night
,
or
more
probably
Kurtz
had
talked
.
`
We
talked
*NL*
of
everything
,
'
he
said
,
quite
transported
at
the
recollection
.
'
I
*NL*
forgot
there
was
such
a
thing
as
sleep
.
The
night
did
not
seem
to
last
*NL*
an
hour
.
Everything
!
Everything
!
...
Of
love
,
too
.
'
`
Ah
,
he
talked
to
*NL*
you
of
love
!
'
I
said
,
much
amused
.
`
It
is
n't
what
you
think
,
'
he
cried
,
*NL*
almost
passionately
.
`
It
was
in
general
.
He
made
me
see
things
--
things
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
threw
his
arms
up
.
We
were
on
deck
at
the
time
,
and
the
headman
*NL*
of
my
wood-cutters
,
lounging
near
by
,
turned
upon
him
his
heavy
and
*NL*
glittering
eyes
.
I
looked
around
,
and
I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
I
assure
you
*NL*
that
never
,
never
before
,
did
this
land
,
this
river
,
this
jungle
,
the
*NL*
very
arch
of
this
blazing
sky
,
appear
to
me
so
hopeless
and
so
dark
,
so
*NL*
impenetrable
to
human
thought
,
so
pitiless
to
human
weakness
.
`
And
,
ever
*NL*
since
,
you
have
been
with
him
,
of
course
?
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
.
It
appears
their
intercourse
had
been
very
much
broken
*NL*
by
various
causes
.
He
had
,
as
he
informed
me
proudly
,
managed
to
nurse
*NL*
Kurtz
through
two
illnesses
-LRB-
he
alluded
to
it
as
you
would
to
some
risky
*NL*
feat
-RRB-
,
but
as
a
rule
Kurtz
wandered
alone
,
far
in
the
depths
of
the
*NL*
forest
.
`
Very
often
coming
to
this
station
,
I
had
to
wait
days
and
*NL*
days
before
he
would
turn
up
,
'
he
said
.
`
Ah
,
it
was
worth
waiting
*NL*
for
!
--
sometimes
.
'
`
What
was
he
doing
?
exploring
or
what
?
'
I
asked
.
`
Oh
,
*NL*
yes
,
of
course
'
;
he
had
discovered
lots
of
villages
,
a
lake
,
too
--
he
*NL*
did
not
know
exactly
in
what
direction
;
it
was
dangerous
to
inquire
*NL*
too
much
--
but
mostly
his
expeditions
had
been
for
ivory
.
`
But
he
had
no
*NL*
goods
to
trade
with
by
that
time
,
'
I
objected
.
`
There
's
a
good
lot
of
*NL*
cartridges
left
even
yet
,
'
he
answered
,
looking
away
.
`
To
speak
plainly
,
*NL*
he
raided
the
country
,
'
I
said
.
He
nodded
.
`
Not
alone
,
surely
!
'
He
*NL*
muttered
something
about
the
villages
round
that
lake
.
`
Kurtz
got
the
*NL*
tribe
to
follow
him
,
did
he
?
'
I
suggested
.
He
fidgeted
a
little
.
`
They
*NL*
adored
him
,
'
he
said
.
The
tone
of
these
words
was
so
extraordinary
that
*NL*
I
looked
at
him
searchingly
.
It
was
curious
to
see
his
mingled
eagerness
*NL*
and
reluctance
to
speak
of
Kurtz
.
The
man
filled
his
life
,
occupied
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
swayed
his
emotions
.
`
What
can
you
expect
?
'
he
burst
out
;
`
he
*NL*
came
to
them
with
thunder
and
lightning
,
you
know
--
and
they
had
never
*NL*
seen
anything
like
it
--
and
very
terrible
.
He
could
be
very
terrible
.
*NL*
You
ca
n't
judge
Mr.
Kurtz
as
you
would
an
ordinary
man
.
No
,
no
,
no
!
*NL*
Now
--
just
to
give
you
an
idea
--
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
,
he
wanted
to
*NL*
shoot
me
,
too
,
one
day
--
but
I
do
n't
judge
him
.
'
`
Shoot
you
!
'
I
cried
*NL*
`
What
for
?
'
`
Well
,
I
had
a
small
lot
of
ivory
the
chief
of
that
village
*NL*
near
my
house
gave
me
.
You
see
I
used
to
shoot
game
for
them
.
Well
,
*NL*
he
wanted
it
,
and
would
n't
hear
reason
.
He
declared
he
would
shoot
me
*NL*
unless
I
gave
him
the
ivory
and
then
cleared
out
of
the
country
,
because
*NL*
he
could
do
so
,
and
had
a
fancy
for
it
,
and
there
was
nothing
on
earth
*NL*
to
prevent
him
killing
whom
he
jolly
well
pleased
.
And
it
was
true
,
too
.
*NL*
I
gave
him
the
ivory
.
What
did
I
care
!
But
I
did
n't
clear
out
.
No
,
no
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
leave
him
.
I
had
to
be
careful
,
of
course
,
till
we
got
friendly
*NL*
again
for
a
time
.
He
had
his
second
illness
then
.
Afterwards
I
had
to
*NL*
keep
out
of
the
way
;
but
I
did
n't
mind
.
He
was
living
for
the
most
part
*NL*
in
those
villages
on
the
lake
.
When
he
came
down
to
the
river
,
sometimes
*NL*
he
would
take
to
me
,
and
sometimes
it
was
better
for
me
to
be
careful
.
*NL*
This
man
suffered
too
much
.
He
hated
all
this
,
and
somehow
he
could
n't
*NL*
get
away
.
When
I
had
a
chance
I
begged
him
to
try
and
leave
while
there
*NL*
was
time
;
I
offered
to
go
back
with
him
.
And
he
would
say
yes
,
and
then
*NL*
he
would
remain
;
go
off
on
another
ivory
hunt
;
disappear
for
weeks
;
*NL*
forget
himself
amongst
these
people
--
forget
himself
--
you
know
.
'
`
Why
!
*NL*
he
's
mad
,
'
I
said
.
He
protested
indignantly
.
Mr.
Kurtz
could
n't
be
mad
.
*NL*
If
I
had
heard
him
talk
,
only
two
days
ago
,
I
would
n't
dare
hint
at
such
*NL*
a
thing
...
I
had
taken
up
my
binoculars
while
we
talked
,
and
was
*NL*
looking
at
the
shore
,
sweeping
the
limit
of
the
forest
at
each
side
and
*NL*
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
The
consciousness
of
there
being
people
in
*NL*
that
bush
,
so
silent
,
so
quiet
--
as
silent
and
quiet
as
the
ruined
house
*NL*
on
the
hill
--
made
me
uneasy
.
There
was
no
sign
on
the
face
of
nature
*NL*
of
this
amazing
tale
that
was
not
so
much
told
as
suggested
to
me
in
*NL*
desolate
exclamations
,
completed
by
shrugs
,
in
interrupted
phrases
,
in
*NL*
hints
ending
in
deep
sighs
.
The
woods
were
unmoved
,
like
a
mask
--
heavy
,
*NL*
like
the
closed
door
of
a
prison
--
they
looked
with
their
air
of
hidden
*NL*
knowledge
,
of
patient
expectation
,
of
unapproachable
silence
.
The
*NL*
Russian
was
explaining
to
me
that
it
was
only
lately
that
Mr.
Kurtz
had
*NL*
come
down
to
the
river
,
bringing
along
with
him
all
the
fighting
men
of
*NL*
that
lake
tribe
.
He
had
been
absent
for
several
months
--
getting
himself
*NL*
adored
,
I
suppose
--
and
had
come
down
unexpectedly
,
with
the
intention
*NL*
to
all
appearance
of
making
a
raid
either
across
the
river
or
down
*NL*
stream
.
Evidently
the
appetite
for
more
ivory
had
got
the
better
of
*NL*
the
--
what
shall
I
say
?
--
less
material
aspirations
.
However
he
had
*NL*
got
much
worse
suddenly
.
'
I
heard
he
was
lying
helpless
,
and
so
I
came
*NL*
up
--
took
my
chance
,
'
said
the
Russian
.
`
Oh
,
he
is
bad
,
very
bad
.
'
I
*NL*
directed
my
glass
to
the
house
.
There
were
no
signs
of
life
,
but
there
*NL*
was
the
ruined
roof
,
the
long
mud
wall
peeping
above
the
grass
,
with
*NL*
three
little
square
window-holes
,
no
two
of
the
same
size
;
all
this
*NL*
brought
within
reach
of
my
hand
,
as
it
were
.
And
then
I
made
a
brusque
*NL*
movement
,
and
one
of
the
remaining
posts
of
that
vanished
fence
leaped
*NL*
up
in
the
field
of
my
glass
.
You
remember
I
told
you
I
had
been
struck
*NL*
at
the
distance
by
certain
attempts
at
ornamentation
,
rather
remarkable
*NL*
in
the
ruinous
aspect
of
the
place
.
Now
I
had
suddenly
a
nearer
view
,
*NL*
and
its
first
result
was
to
make
me
throw
my
head
back
as
if
before
a
*NL*
blow
.
Then
I
went
carefully
from
post
to
post
with
my
glass
,
and
I
saw
*NL*
my
mistake
.
These
round
knobs
were
not
ornamental
but
symbolic
;
they
*NL*
were
expressive
and
puzzling
,
striking
and
disturbing
--
food
for
thought
*NL*
and
also
for
vultures
if
there
had
been
any
looking
down
from
the
sky
;
*NL*
but
at
all
events
for
such
ants
as
were
industrious
enough
to
ascend
*NL*
the
pole
.
They
would
have
been
even
more
impressive
,
those
heads
on
the
*NL*
stakes
,
if
their
faces
had
not
been
turned
to
the
house
.
Only
one
,
the
*NL*
first
I
had
made
out
,
was
facing
my
way
.
I
was
not
so
shocked
as
you
may
*NL*
think
.
The
start
back
I
had
given
was
really
nothing
but
a
movement
*NL*
of
surprise
.
I
had
expected
to
see
a
knob
of
wood
there
,
you
know
.
I
*NL*
returned
deliberately
to
the
first
I
had
seen
--
and
there
it
was
,
black
,
*NL*
dried
,
sunken
,
with
closed
eyelids
--
a
head
that
seemed
to
sleep
at
the
*NL*
top
of
that
pole
,
and
,
with
the
shrunken
dry
lips
showing
a
narrow
*NL*
white
line
of
the
teeth
,
was
smiling
,
too
,
smiling
continuously
at
some
*NL*
endless
and
jocose
dream
of
that
eternal
slumber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
disclosing
any
trade
secrets
.
In
fact
,
the
manager
said
*NL*
afterwards
that
Mr.
Kurtz
's
methods
had
ruined
the
district
.
I
have
no
*NL*
opinion
on
that
point
,
but
I
want
you
clearly
to
understand
that
there
*NL*
was
nothing
exactly
profitable
in
these
heads
being
there
.
They
only
*NL*
showed
that
Mr.
Kurtz
lacked
restraint
in
the
gratification
of
his
*NL*
various
lusts
,
that
there
was
something
wanting
in
him
--
some
small
*NL*
matter
which
,
when
the
pressing
need
arose
,
could
not
be
found
under
*NL*
his
magnificent
eloquence
.
Whether
he
knew
of
this
deficiency
himself
I
*NL*
ca
n't
say
.
I
think
the
knowledge
came
to
him
at
last
--
only
at
the
very
*NL*
last
.
But
the
wilderness
had
found
him
out
early
,
and
had
taken
on
him
a
*NL*
terrible
vengeance
for
the
fantastic
invasion
.
I
think
it
had
whispered
*NL*
to
him
things
about
himself
which
he
did
not
know
,
things
of
which
he
*NL*
had
no
conception
till
he
took
counsel
with
this
great
solitude
--
and
the
*NL*
whisper
had
proved
irresistibly
fascinating
.
It
echoed
loudly
within
him
*NL*
because
he
was
hollow
at
the
core
...
I
put
down
the
glass
,
and
the
*NL*
head
that
had
appeared
near
enough
to
be
spoken
to
seemed
at
once
to
*NL*
have
leaped
away
from
me
into
inaccessible
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
admirer
of
Mr.
Kurtz
was
a
bit
crestfallen
.
In
a
hurried
,
*NL*
indistinct
voice
he
began
to
assure
me
he
had
not
dared
to
take
*NL*
these
--
say
,
symbols
--
down
.
He
was
not
afraid
of
the
natives
;
they
would
*NL*
not
stir
till
Mr.
Kurtz
gave
the
word
.
His
ascendancy
was
extraordinary
.
*NL*
The
camps
of
these
people
surrounded
the
place
,
and
the
chiefs
came
*NL*
every
day
to
see
him
.
They
would
crawl
...
'
I
do
n't
want
to
know
*NL*
anything
of
the
ceremonies
used
when
approaching
Mr.
Kurtz
,
'
I
shouted
.
*NL*
Curious
,
this
feeling
that
came
over
me
that
such
details
would
be
more
*NL*
intolerable
than
those
heads
drying
on
the
stakes
under
Mr.
Kurtz
's
*NL*
windows
.
After
all
,
that
was
only
a
savage
sight
,
while
I
seemed
at
*NL*
one
bound
to
have
been
transported
into
some
lightless
region
of
subtle
*NL*
horrors
,
where
pure
,
uncomplicated
savagery
was
a
positive
relief
,
being
*NL*
something
that
had
a
right
to
exist
--
obviously
--
in
the
sunshine
.
The
*NL*
young
man
looked
at
me
with
surprise
.
I
suppose
it
did
not
occur
to
*NL*
him
that
Mr.
Kurtz
was
no
idol
of
mine
.
He
forgot
I
had
n't
heard
any
of
*NL*
these
splendid
monologues
on
,
what
was
it
?
on
love
,
justice
,
conduct
*NL*
of
life
--
or
what
not
.
If
it
had
come
to
crawling
before
Mr.
Kurtz
,
he
*NL*
crawled
as
much
as
the
veriest
savage
of
them
all
.
I
had
no
idea
of
the
*NL*
conditions
,
he
said
:
these
heads
were
the
heads
of
rebels
.
I
shocked
him
*NL*
excessively
by
laughing
.
Rebels
!
What
would
be
the
next
definition
I
*NL*
was
to
hear
?
There
had
been
enemies
,
criminals
,
workers
--
and
these
*NL*
were
rebels
.
Those
rebellious
heads
looked
very
subdued
to
me
on
their
*NL*
sticks
.
`
You
do
n't
know
how
such
a
life
tries
a
man
like
Kurtz
,
'
cried
*NL*
Kurtz
's
last
disciple
.
`
Well
,
and
you
?
'
I
said
.
`
I
!
I
!
I
am
a
simple
*NL*
man
.
I
have
no
great
thoughts
.
I
want
nothing
from
anybody
.
How
can
*NL*
you
compare
me
to
...
?
'
His
feelings
were
too
much
for
speech
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
he
broke
down
.
'
I
do
n't
understand
,
'
he
groaned
.
`
I
've
been
*NL*
doing
my
best
to
keep
him
alive
,
and
that
's
enough
.
I
had
no
hand
in
*NL*
all
this
.
I
have
no
abilities
.
There
has
n't
been
a
drop
of
medicine
or
a
*NL*
mouthful
of
invalid
food
for
months
here
.
He
was
shamefully
abandoned
.
*NL*
A
man
like
this
,
with
such
ideas
.
Shamefully
!
Shamefully
!
I
--
I
--
have
n't
*NL*
slept
for
the
last
ten
nights
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
voice
lost
itself
in
the
calm
of
the
evening
.
The
long
shadows
of
*NL*
the
forest
had
slipped
downhill
while
we
talked
,
had
gone
far
beyond
*NL*
the
ruined
hovel
,
beyond
the
symbolic
row
of
stakes
.
All
this
was
in
the
*NL*
gloom
,
while
we
down
there
were
yet
in
the
sunshine
,
and
the
stretch
*NL*
of
the
river
abreast
of
the
clearing
glittered
in
a
still
and
dazzling
*NL*
splendour
,
with
a
murky
and
overshadowed
bend
above
and
below
.
Not
a
*NL*
living
soul
was
seen
on
the
shore
.
The
bushes
did
not
rustle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suddenly
round
the
corner
of
the
house
a
group
of
men
appeared
,
as
*NL*
though
they
had
come
up
from
the
ground
.
They
waded
waist-deep
in
the
*NL*
grass
,
in
a
compact
body
,
bearing
an
improvised
stretcher
in
their
*NL*
midst
.
Instantly
,
in
the
emptiness
of
the
landscape
,
a
cry
arose
whose
*NL*
shrillness
pierced
the
still
air
like
a
sharp
arrow
flying
straight
to
*NL*
the
very
heart
of
the
land
;
and
,
as
if
by
enchantment
,
streams
of
human
*NL*
beings
--
of
naked
human
beings
--
with
spears
in
their
hands
,
with
bows
,
*NL*
with
shields
,
with
wild
glances
and
savage
movements
,
were
poured
into
*NL*
the
clearing
by
the
dark-faced
and
pensive
forest
.
The
bushes
shook
,
the
*NL*
grass
swayed
for
a
time
,
and
then
everything
stood
still
in
attentive
*NL*
immobility
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Now
,
if
he
does
not
say
the
right
thing
to
them
we
are
all
done
for
,
'
*NL*
said
the
Russian
at
my
elbow
.
The
knot
of
men
with
the
stretcher
had
*NL*
stopped
,
too
,
halfway
to
the
steamer
,
as
if
petrified
.
I
saw
the
man
on
*NL*
the
stretcher
sit
up
,
lank
and
with
an
uplifted
arm
,
above
the
shoulders
*NL*
of
the
bearers
.
`
Let
us
hope
that
the
man
who
can
talk
so
well
of
love
*NL*
in
general
will
find
some
particular
reason
to
spare
us
this
time
,
'
I
*NL*
said
.
I
resented
bitterly
the
absurd
danger
of
our
situation
,
as
if
*NL*
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
that
atrocious
phantom
had
been
a
dishonouring
*NL*
necessity
.
I
could
not
hear
a
sound
,
but
through
my
glasses
I
saw
the
*NL*
thin
arm
extended
commandingly
,
the
lower
jaw
moving
,
the
eyes
of
*NL*
that
apparition
shining
darkly
far
in
its
bony
head
that
nodded
with
*NL*
grotesque
jerks
.
Kurtz
--
Kurtz
--
that
means
short
in
German
--
do
n't
it
?
*NL*
Well
,
the
name
was
as
true
as
everything
else
in
his
life
--
and
death
.
*NL*
He
looked
at
least
seven
feet
long
.
His
covering
had
fallen
off
,
and
his
*NL*
body
emerged
from
it
pitiful
and
appalling
as
from
a
winding-sheet
.
I
*NL*
could
see
the
cage
of
his
ribs
all
astir
,
the
bones
of
his
arm
waving
.
*NL*
It
was
as
though
an
animated
image
of
death
carved
out
of
old
ivory
had
*NL*
been
shaking
its
hand
with
menaces
at
a
motionless
crowd
of
men
made
of
*NL*
dark
and
glittering
bronze
.
I
saw
him
open
his
mouth
wide
--
it
gave
him
*NL*
a
weirdly
voracious
aspect
,
as
though
he
had
wanted
to
swallow
all
the
*NL*
air
,
all
the
earth
,
all
the
men
before
him
.
A
deep
voice
reached
*NL*
me
faintly
.
He
must
have
been
shouting
.
He
fell
back
suddenly
.
The
*NL*
stretcher
shook
as
the
bearers
staggered
forward
again
,
and
almost
at
*NL*
the
same
time
I
noticed
that
the
crowd
of
savages
was
vanishing
without
*NL*
any
perceptible
movement
of
retreat
,
as
if
the
forest
that
had
ejected
*NL*
these
beings
so
suddenly
had
drawn
them
in
again
as
the
breath
is
drawn
*NL*
in
a
long
aspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
the
pilgrims
behind
the
stretcher
carried
his
*NL*
arms
--
two
shot-guns
,
a
heavy
rifle
,
and
a
light
revolver-carbine
--
the
*NL*
thunderbolts
of
that
pitiful
Jupiter
.
The
manager
bent
over
him
*NL*
murmuring
as
he
walked
beside
his
head
.
They
laid
him
down
in
one
of
the
*NL*
little
cabins
--
just
a
room
for
a
bed
place
and
a
camp-stool
or
two
,
*NL*
you
know
.
We
had
brought
his
belated
correspondence
,
and
a
lot
of
torn
*NL*
envelopes
and
open
letters
littered
his
bed
.
His
hand
roamed
feebly
*NL*
amongst
these
papers
.
I
was
struck
by
the
fire
of
his
eyes
and
the
*NL*
composed
languor
of
his
expression
.
It
was
not
so
much
the
exhaustion
of
*NL*
disease
.
He
did
not
seem
in
pain
.
This
shadow
looked
satiated
and
calm
,
*NL*
as
though
for
the
moment
it
had
had
its
fill
of
all
the
emotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
rustled
one
of
the
letters
,
and
looking
straight
in
my
face
said
,
*NL*
'
I
am
glad
.
'
Somebody
had
been
writing
to
him
about
me
.
These
special
*NL*
recommendations
were
turning
up
again
.
The
volume
of
tone
he
emitted
*NL*
without
effort
,
almost
without
the
trouble
of
moving
his
lips
,
amazed
*NL*
me
.
A
voice
!
a
voice
!
It
was
grave
,
profound
,
vibrating
,
while
the
man
*NL*
did
not
seem
capable
of
a
whisper
.
However
,
he
had
enough
strength
in
*NL*
him
--
factitious
no
doubt
--
to
very
nearly
make
an
end
of
us
,
as
you
*NL*
shall
hear
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
manager
appeared
silently
in
the
doorway
;
I
stepped
out
at
once
*NL*
and
he
drew
the
curtain
after
me
.
The
Russian
,
eyed
curiously
by
the
*NL*
pilgrims
,
was
staring
at
the
shore
.
I
followed
the
direction
of
his
*NL*
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dark
human
shapes
could
be
made
out
in
the
distance
,
flitting
*NL*
indistinctly
against
the
gloomy
border
of
the
forest
,
and
near
the
river
*NL*
two
bronze
figures
,
leaning
on
tall
spears
,
stood
in
the
sunlight
under
*NL*
fantastic
head-dresses
of
spotted
skins
,
warlike
and
still
in
statuesque
*NL*
repose
.
And
from
right
to
left
along
the
lighted
shore
moved
a
wild
and
*NL*
gorgeous
apparition
of
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
walked
with
measured
steps
,
draped
in
striped
and
fringed
cloths
,
*NL*
treading
the
earth
proudly
,
with
a
slight
jingle
and
flash
of
barbarous
*NL*
ornaments
.
She
carried
her
head
high
;
her
hair
was
done
in
the
shape
of
*NL*
a
helmet
;
she
had
brass
leggings
to
the
knee
,
brass
wire
gauntlets
to
*NL*
the
elbow
,
a
crimson
spot
on
her
tawny
cheek
,
innumerable
necklaces
of
*NL*
glass
beads
on
her
neck
;
bizarre
things
,
charms
,
gifts
of
witch-men
,
*NL*
that
hung
about
her
,
glittered
and
trembled
at
every
step
.
She
must
have
*NL*
had
the
value
of
several
elephant
tusks
upon
her
.
She
was
savage
and
*NL*
superb
,
wild-eyed
and
magnificent
;
there
was
something
ominous
and
*NL*
stately
in
her
deliberate
progress
.
And
in
the
hush
that
had
fallen
*NL*
suddenly
upon
the
whole
sorrowful
land
,
the
immense
wilderness
,
the
*NL*
colossal
body
of
the
fecund
and
mysterious
life
seemed
to
look
at
her
,
*NL*
pensive
,
as
though
it
had
been
looking
at
the
image
of
its
own
tenebrous
*NL*
and
passionate
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
came
abreast
of
the
steamer
,
stood
still
,
and
faced
us
.
Her
long
*NL*
shadow
fell
to
the
water
's
edge
.
Her
face
had
a
tragic
and
fierce
*NL*
aspect
of
wild
sorrow
and
of
dumb
pain
mingled
with
the
fear
of
some
*NL*
struggling
,
half-shaped
resolve
.
She
stood
looking
at
us
without
a
*NL*
stir
,
and
like
the
wilderness
itself
,
with
an
air
of
brooding
over
an
*NL*
inscrutable
purpose
.
A
whole
minute
passed
,
and
then
she
made
a
step
*NL*
forward
.
There
was
a
low
jingle
,
a
glint
of
yellow
metal
,
a
sway
of
*NL*
fringed
draperies
,
and
she
stopped
as
if
her
heart
had
failed
her
.
The
*NL*
young
fellow
by
my
side
growled
.
The
pilgrims
murmured
at
my
back
.
*NL*
She
looked
at
us
all
as
if
her
life
had
depended
upon
the
unswerving
*NL*
steadiness
of
her
glance
.
Suddenly
she
opened
her
bared
arms
and
threw
*NL*
them
up
rigid
above
her
head
,
as
though
in
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
*NL*
touch
the
sky
,
and
at
the
same
time
the
swift
shadows
darted
out
on
the
*NL*
earth
,
swept
around
on
the
river
,
gathering
the
steamer
into
a
shadowy
*NL*
embrace
.
A
formidable
silence
hung
over
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
turned
away
slowly
,
walked
on
,
following
the
bank
,
and
passed
into
*NL*
the
bushes
to
the
left
.
Once
only
her
eyes
gleamed
back
at
us
in
the
*NL*
dusk
of
the
thickets
before
she
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
If
she
had
offered
to
come
aboard
I
really
think
I
would
have
tried
to
*NL*
shoot
her
,
'
said
the
man
of
patches
,
nervously
.
'
I
have
been
risking
my
*NL*
life
every
day
for
the
last
fortnight
to
keep
her
out
of
the
house
.
She
*NL*
got
in
one
day
and
kicked
up
a
row
about
those
miserable
rags
I
picked
*NL*
up
in
the
storeroom
to
mend
my
clothes
with
.
I
was
n't
decent
.
At
least
*NL*
it
must
have
been
that
,
for
she
talked
like
a
fury
to
Kurtz
for
an
hour
,
*NL*
pointing
at
me
now
and
then
.
I
do
n't
understand
the
dialect
of
this
*NL*
tribe
.
Luckily
for
me
,
I
fancy
Kurtz
felt
too
ill
that
day
to
care
,
or
*NL*
there
would
have
been
mischief
.
I
do
n't
understand
...
No
--
it
's
too
*NL*
much
for
me
.
Ah
,
well
,
it
's
all
over
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
moment
I
heard
Kurtz
's
deep
voice
behind
the
curtain
:
`
Save
*NL*
me
!
--
save
the
ivory
,
you
mean
.
Do
n't
tell
me
.
Save
_
me
!
_
Why
,
I
've
had
to
*NL*
save
you
.
You
are
interrupting
my
plans
now
.
Sick
!
Sick
!
Not
so
sick
as
*NL*
you
would
like
to
believe
.
Never
mind
.
I
'll
carry
my
ideas
out
yet
--
I
*NL*
will
return
.
I
'll
show
you
what
can
be
done
.
You
with
your
little
*NL*
peddling
notions
--
you
are
interfering
with
me
.
I
will
return
.
I.

``
The
manager
came
out
.
He
did
me
the
honour
to
take
me
under
the
arm
*NL*
and
lead
me
aside
.
`
He
is
very
low
,
very
low
,
'
he
said
.
He
considered
it
*NL*
necessary
to
sigh
,
but
neglected
to
be
consistently
sorrowful
.
`
We
have
*NL*
done
all
we
could
for
him
--
have
n't
we
?
But
there
is
no
disguising
the
*NL*
fact
,
Mr.
Kurtz
has
done
more
harm
than
good
to
the
Company
.
He
did
*NL*
not
see
the
time
was
not
ripe
for
vigorous
action
.
Cautiously
,
*NL*
cautiously
--
that
's
my
principle
.
We
must
be
cautious
yet
.
The
district
*NL*
is
closed
to
us
for
a
time
.
Deplorable
!
Upon
the
whole
,
the
trade
will
*NL*
suffer
.
I
do
n't
deny
there
is
a
remarkable
quantity
of
ivory
--
mostly
*NL*
fossil
.
We
must
save
it
,
at
all
events
--
but
look
how
precarious
the
*NL*
position
is
--
and
why
?
Because
the
method
is
unsound
.
'
`
Do
you
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
shore
,
`
call
it
``
unsound
method
?
''
'
`
Without
doubt
,
'
he
*NL*
exclaimed
hotly
.
`
Do
n't
you
?
'
...
`
No
method
at
all
,
'
I
murmured
after
*NL*
a
while
.
`
Exactly
,
'
he
exulted
.
'
I
anticipated
this
.
Shows
a
complete
*NL*
want
of
judgment
.
It
is
my
duty
to
point
it
out
in
the
proper
quarter
.
'
*NL*
`
Oh
,
'
said
I
,
`
that
fellow
--
what
's
his
name
?
--
the
brickmaker
,
will
make
*NL*
a
readable
report
for
you
.
'
He
appeared
confounded
for
a
moment
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
me
I
had
never
breathed
an
atmosphere
so
vile
,
and
I
turned
*NL*
mentally
to
Kurtz
for
relief
--
positively
for
relief
.
`
Nevertheless
I
*NL*
think
Mr.
Kurtz
is
a
remarkable
man
,
'
I
said
with
emphasis
.
He
started
,
*NL*
dropped
on
me
a
heavy
glance
,
said
very
quietly
,
`
he
_
was
_
,
'
and
turned
*NL*
his
back
on
me
.
My
hour
of
favour
was
over
;
I
found
myself
lumped
along
*NL*
with
Kurtz
as
a
partisan
of
methods
for
which
the
time
was
not
ripe
:
*NL*
I
was
unsound
!
Ah
!
but
it
was
something
to
have
at
least
a
choice
of
*NL*
nightmares
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
turned
to
the
wilderness
really
,
not
to
Mr.
Kurtz
,
who
,
I
was
*NL*
ready
to
admit
,
was
as
good
as
buried
.
And
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
me
*NL*
as
if
I
also
were
buried
in
a
vast
grave
full
of
unspeakable
secrets
.
I
*NL*
felt
an
intolerable
weight
oppressing
my
breast
,
the
smell
of
the
damp
*NL*
earth
,
the
unseen
presence
of
victorious
corruption
,
the
darkness
of
an
*NL*
impenetrable
night
...
The
Russian
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
.
I
heard
*NL*
him
mumbling
and
stammering
something
about
`
brother
seaman
--
could
n't
*NL*
conceal
--
knowledge
of
matters
that
would
affect
Mr.
Kurtz
's
*NL*
reputation
.
'
I
waited
.
For
him
evidently
Mr.
Kurtz
was
not
in
his
grave
;
*NL*
I
suspect
that
for
him
Mr.
Kurtz
was
one
of
the
immortals
.
`
Well
!
'
said
*NL*
I
at
last
,
`
speak
out
.
As
it
happens
,
I
am
Mr.
Kurtz
's
friend
--
in
a
*NL*
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
stated
with
a
good
deal
of
formality
that
had
we
not
been
`
of
the
*NL*
same
profession
,
'
he
would
have
kept
the
matter
to
himself
without
*NL*
regard
to
consequences
.
`
He
suspected
there
was
an
active
ill-will
*NL*
towards
him
on
the
part
of
these
white
men
that
--
'
`
You
are
right
,
'
I
*NL*
said
,
remembering
a
certain
conversation
I
had
overheard
.
`
The
manager
*NL*
thinks
you
ought
to
be
hanged
.
'
He
showed
a
concern
at
this
intelligence
*NL*
which
amused
me
at
first
.
'
I
had
better
get
out
of
the
way
quietly
,
'
*NL*
he
said
earnestly
.
'
I
can
do
no
more
for
Kurtz
now
,
and
they
would
soon
*NL*
find
some
excuse
.
What
's
to
stop
them
?
There
's
a
military
post
three
*NL*
hundred
miles
from
here
.
'
`
Well
,
upon
my
word
,
'
said
I
,
`
perhaps
you
*NL*
had
better
go
if
you
have
any
friends
amongst
the
savages
near
by
.
'
*NL*
`
Plenty
,
'
he
said
.
`
They
are
simple
people
--
and
I
want
nothing
,
you
*NL*
know
.
'
He
stood
biting
his
lip
,
then
:
'
I
do
n't
want
any
harm
to
happen
*NL*
to
these
whites
here
,
but
of
course
I
was
thinking
of
Mr.
Kurtz
's
*NL*
reputation
--
but
you
are
a
brother
seaman
and
--
'
`
All
right
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
after
a
time
.
`
Mr.
Kurtz
's
reputation
is
safe
with
me
.
'
I
did
not
know
*NL*
how
truly
I
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
informed
me
,
lowering
his
voice
,
that
it
was
Kurtz
who
had
ordered
*NL*
the
attack
to
be
made
on
the
steamer
.
`
He
hated
sometimes
the
idea
of
*NL*
being
taken
away
--
and
then
again
...
But
I
do
n't
understand
these
*NL*
matters
.
I
am
a
simple
man
.
He
thought
it
would
scare
you
away
--
that
you
*NL*
would
give
it
up
,
thinking
him
dead
.
I
could
not
stop
him
.
Oh
,
I
had
an
*NL*
awful
time
of
it
this
last
month
.
'
`
Very
well
,
'
I
said
.
`
He
is
all
right
*NL*
now
.
'
`
Ye-e-es
,
'
he
muttered
,
not
very
convinced
apparently
.
`
Thanks
,
'
*NL*
said
I
;
'
I
shall
keep
my
eyes
open
.
'
`
But
quiet-eh
?
'
he
urged
anxiously
.
*NL*
`
It
would
be
awful
for
his
reputation
if
anybody
here
--
'
I
promised
a
*NL*
complete
discretion
with
great
gravity
.
'
I
have
a
canoe
and
three
*NL*
black
fellows
waiting
not
very
far
.
I
am
off
.
Could
you
give
me
a
few
*NL*
Martini-Henry
cartridges
?
'
I
could
,
and
did
,
with
proper
secrecy
.
He
*NL*
helped
himself
,
with
a
wink
at
me
,
to
a
handful
of
my
tobacco
.
`
Between
*NL*
sailors
--
you
know
--
good
English
tobacco
.
'
At
the
door
of
the
pilot-house
*NL*
he
turned
round
--
'
I
say
,
have
n't
you
a
pair
of
shoes
you
could
spare
?
'
*NL*
He
raised
one
leg
.
`
Look
.
'
The
soles
were
tied
with
knotted
strings
*NL*
sandalwise
under
his
bare
feet
.
I
rooted
out
an
old
pair
,
at
which
he
*NL*
looked
with
admiration
before
tucking
it
under
his
left
arm
.
One
of
his
*NL*
pockets
-LRB-
bright
red
-RRB-
was
bulging
with
cartridges
,
from
the
other
-LRB-
dark
*NL*
blue
-RRB-
peeped
`
Towson
's
Inquiry
,
'
etc.
,
etc.
.
He
seemed
to
think
himself
*NL*
excellently
well
equipped
for
a
renewed
encounter
with
the
wilderness
.
*NL*
`
Ah
!
I
'll
never
,
never
meet
such
a
man
again
.
You
ought
to
have
heard
*NL*
him
recite
poetry
--
his
own
,
too
,
it
was
,
he
told
me
.
Poetry
!
'
He
rolled
*NL*
his
eyes
at
the
recollection
of
these
delights
.
`
Oh
,
he
enlarged
my
*NL*
mind
!
'
`
Good-bye
,
'
said
I
.
He
shook
hands
and
vanished
in
the
night
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
ask
myself
whether
I
had
ever
really
seen
him
--
whether
it
*NL*
was
possible
to
meet
such
a
phenomenon
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
woke
up
shortly
after
midnight
his
warning
came
to
my
mind
with
*NL*
its
hint
of
danger
that
seemed
,
in
the
starred
darkness
,
real
enough
to
*NL*
make
me
get
up
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
look
round
.
On
the
hill
a
*NL*
big
fire
burned
,
illuminating
fitfully
a
crooked
corner
of
the
*NL*
station-house
.
One
of
the
agents
with
a
picket
of
a
few
of
our
blacks
,
*NL*
armed
for
the
purpose
,
was
keeping
guard
over
the
ivory
;
but
deep
within
*NL*
the
forest
,
red
gleams
that
wavered
,
that
seemed
to
sink
and
rise
from
*NL*
the
ground
amongst
confused
columnar
shapes
of
intense
blackness
,
showed
*NL*
the
exact
position
of
the
camp
where
Mr.
Kurtz
's
adorers
were
keeping
*NL*
their
uneasy
vigil
.
The
monotonous
beating
of
a
big
drum
filled
the
air
*NL*
with
muffled
shocks
and
a
lingering
vibration
.
A
steady
droning
sound
of
*NL*
many
men
chanting
each
to
himself
some
weird
incantation
came
out
from
*NL*
the
black
,
flat
wall
of
the
woods
as
the
humming
of
bees
comes
out
of
*NL*
a
hive
,
and
had
a
strange
narcotic
effect
upon
my
half-awake
senses
.
*NL*
I
believe
I
dozed
off
leaning
over
the
rail
,
till
an
abrupt
burst
of
*NL*
yells
,
an
overwhelming
outbreak
of
a
pent-up
and
mysterious
frenzy
,
woke
*NL*
me
up
in
a
bewildered
wonder
.
It
was
cut
short
all
at
once
,
and
the
*NL*
low
droning
went
on
with
an
effect
of
audible
and
soothing
silence
.
I
*NL*
glanced
casually
into
the
little
cabin
.
A
light
was
burning
within
,
but
*NL*
Mr.
Kurtz
was
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
would
have
raised
an
outcry
if
I
had
believed
my
eyes
.
But
I
*NL*
did
n't
believe
them
at
first
--
the
thing
seemed
so
impossible
.
The
fact
*NL*
is
I
was
completely
unnerved
by
a
sheer
blank
fright
,
pure
abstract
*NL*
terror
,
unconnected
with
any
distinct
shape
of
physical
danger
.
What
*NL*
made
this
emotion
so
overpowering
was
--
how
shall
I
define
it
?
--
the
*NL*
moral
shock
I
received
,
as
if
something
altogether
monstrous
,
*NL*
intolerable
to
thought
and
odious
to
the
soul
,
had
been
thrust
upon
me
*NL*
unexpectedly
.
This
lasted
of
course
the
merest
fraction
of
a
second
,
and
*NL*
then
the
usual
sense
of
commonplace
,
deadly
danger
,
the
possibility
of
*NL*
a
sudden
onslaught
and
massacre
,
or
something
of
the
kind
,
which
I
saw
*NL*
impending
,
was
positively
welcome
and
composing
.
It
pacified
me
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
so
much
that
I
did
not
raise
an
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
an
agent
buttoned
up
inside
an
ulster
and
sleeping
on
a
chair
*NL*
on
deck
within
three
feet
of
me
.
The
yells
had
not
awakened
him
;
he
*NL*
snored
very
slightly
;
I
left
him
to
his
slumbers
and
leaped
ashore
.
*NL*
I
did
not
betray
Mr.
Kurtz
--
it
was
ordered
I
should
never
betray
him
--
it
*NL*
was
written
I
should
be
loyal
to
the
nightmare
of
my
choice
.
I
was
*NL*
anxious
to
deal
with
this
shadow
by
myself
alone
--
and
to
this
day
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
why
I
was
so
jealous
of
sharing
with
any
one
the
peculiar
*NL*
blackness
of
that
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
I
got
on
the
bank
I
saw
a
trail
--
a
broad
trail
through
the
*NL*
grass
.
I
remember
the
exultation
with
which
I
said
to
myself
,
`
He
ca
n't
*NL*
walk
--
he
is
crawling
on
all-fours
--
I
've
got
him
.
'
The
grass
was
wet
*NL*
with
dew
.
I
strode
rapidly
with
clenched
fists
.
I
fancy
I
had
some
vague
*NL*
notion
of
falling
upon
him
and
giving
him
a
drubbing
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
*NL*
had
some
imbecile
thoughts
.
The
knitting
old
woman
with
the
cat
obtruded
*NL*
herself
upon
my
memory
as
a
most
improper
person
to
be
sitting
at
the
*NL*
other
end
of
such
an
affair
.
I
saw
a
row
of
pilgrims
squirting
lead
in
*NL*
the
air
out
of
Winchesters
held
to
the
hip
.
I
thought
I
would
never
get
*NL*
back
to
the
steamer
,
and
imagined
myself
living
alone
and
unarmed
in
the
*NL*
woods
to
an
advanced
age
.
Such
silly
things
--
you
know
.
And
I
remember
*NL*
I
confounded
the
beat
of
the
drum
with
the
beating
of
my
heart
,
and
was
*NL*
pleased
at
its
calm
regularity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
kept
to
the
track
though
--
then
stopped
to
listen
.
The
night
was
very
*NL*
clear
;
a
dark
blue
space
,
sparkling
with
dew
and
starlight
,
in
which
*NL*
black
things
stood
very
still
.
I
thought
I
could
see
a
kind
of
motion
*NL*
ahead
of
me
.
I
was
strangely
cocksure
of
everything
that
night
.
I
*NL*
actually
left
the
track
and
ran
in
a
wide
semicircle
-LRB-
I
verily
believe
*NL*
chuckling
to
myself
-RRB-
so
as
to
get
in
front
of
that
stir
,
of
that
motion
*NL*
I
had
seen
--
if
indeed
I
had
seen
anything
.
I
was
circumventing
Kurtz
as
*NL*
though
it
had
been
a
boyish
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
upon
him
,
and
,
if
he
had
not
heard
me
coming
,
I
would
have
*NL*
fallen
over
him
,
too
,
but
he
got
up
in
time
.
He
rose
,
unsteady
,
long
,
*NL*
pale
,
indistinct
,
like
a
vapour
exhaled
by
the
earth
,
and
swayed
*NL*
slightly
,
misty
and
silent
before
me
;
while
at
my
back
the
fires
loomed
*NL*
between
the
trees
,
and
the
murmur
of
many
voices
issued
from
the
forest
.
*NL*
I
had
cut
him
off
cleverly
;
but
when
actually
confronting
him
I
seemed
*NL*
to
come
to
my
senses
,
I
saw
the
danger
in
its
right
proportion
.
It
was
*NL*
by
no
means
over
yet
.
Suppose
he
began
to
shout
?
Though
he
could
hardly
*NL*
stand
,
there
was
still
plenty
of
vigour
in
his
voice
.
`
Go
away
--
hide
*NL*
yourself
,
'
he
said
,
in
that
profound
tone
.
It
was
very
awful
.
I
glanced
*NL*
back
.
We
were
within
thirty
yards
from
the
nearest
fire
.
A
black
figure
*NL*
stood
up
,
strode
on
long
black
legs
,
waving
long
black
arms
,
across
the
*NL*
glow
.
It
had
horns
--
antelope
horns
,
I
think
--
on
its
head
.
Some
sorcerer
,
*NL*
some
witch-man
,
no
doubt
:
it
looked
fiendlike
enough
.
`
Do
you
know
what
*NL*
you
are
doing
?
'
I
whispered
.
`
Perfectly
,
'
he
answered
,
raising
his
voice
*NL*
for
that
single
word
:
it
sounded
to
me
far
off
and
yet
loud
,
like
a
hail
*NL*
through
a
speaking-trumpet
.
`
If
he
makes
a
row
we
are
lost
,
'
I
thought
*NL*
to
myself
.
This
clearly
was
not
a
case
for
fisticuffs
,
even
apart
from
*NL*
the
very
natural
aversion
I
had
to
beat
that
Shadow
--
this
wandering
and
*NL*
tormented
thing
.
`
You
will
be
lost
,
'
I
said
--
`
utterly
lost
.
'
One
gets
*NL*
sometimes
such
a
flash
of
inspiration
,
you
know
.
I
did
say
the
right
*NL*
thing
,
though
indeed
he
could
not
have
been
more
irretrievably
lost
than
*NL*
he
was
at
this
very
moment
,
when
the
foundations
of
our
intimacy
were
*NL*
being
laid
--
to
endure
--
to
endure
--
even
to
the
end
--
even
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
had
immense
plans
,
'
he
muttered
irresolutely
.
`
Yes
,
'
said
I
;
`
but
if
*NL*
you
try
to
shout
I
'll
smash
your
head
with
--
'
There
was
not
a
stick
or
*NL*
a
stone
near
.
'
I
will
throttle
you
for
good
,
'
I
corrected
myself
.
'
I
was
*NL*
on
the
threshold
of
great
things
,
'
he
pleaded
,
in
a
voice
of
longing
,
*NL*
with
a
wistfulness
of
tone
that
made
my
blood
run
cold
.
`
And
now
for
*NL*
this
stupid
scoundrel
--
'
`
Your
success
in
Europe
is
assured
in
any
*NL*
case
,
'
I
affirmed
steadily
.
I
did
not
want
to
have
the
throttling
of
*NL*
him
,
you
understand
--
and
indeed
it
would
have
been
very
little
use
for
*NL*
any
practical
purpose
.
I
tried
to
break
the
spell
--
the
heavy
,
mute
spell
*NL*
of
the
wilderness
--
that
seemed
to
draw
him
to
its
pitiless
breast
*NL*
by
the
awakening
of
forgotten
and
brutal
instincts
,
by
the
memory
of
*NL*
gratified
and
monstrous
passions
.
This
alone
,
I
was
convinced
,
had
*NL*
driven
him
out
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
,
to
the
bush
,
towards
the
gleam
*NL*
of
fires
,
the
throb
of
drums
,
the
drone
of
weird
incantations
;
this
*NL*
alone
had
beguiled
his
unlawful
soul
beyond
the
bounds
of
permitted
*NL*
aspirations
.
And
,
do
n't
you
see
,
the
terror
of
the
position
was
not
in
*NL*
being
knocked
on
the
head
--
though
I
had
a
very
lively
sense
of
that
*NL*
danger
,
too
--
but
in
this
,
that
I
had
to
deal
with
a
being
to
whom
I
*NL*
could
not
appeal
in
the
name
of
anything
high
or
low
.
I
had
,
even
like
*NL*
the
niggers
,
to
invoke
him
--
himself
--
his
own
exalted
and
incredible
*NL*
degradation
.
There
was
nothing
either
above
or
below
him
,
and
I
knew
*NL*
it
.
He
had
kicked
himself
loose
of
the
earth
.
Confound
the
man
!
he
had
*NL*
kicked
the
very
earth
to
pieces
.
He
was
alone
,
and
I
before
him
did
*NL*
not
know
whether
I
stood
on
the
ground
or
floated
in
the
air
.
I
've
been
*NL*
telling
you
what
we
said
--
repeating
the
phrases
we
pronounced
--
but
*NL*
what
's
the
good
?
They
were
common
everyday
words
--
the
familiar
,
vague
*NL*
sounds
exchanged
on
every
waking
day
of
life
.
But
what
of
that
?
They
had
*NL*
behind
them
,
to
my
mind
,
the
terrific
suggestiveness
of
words
heard
in
*NL*
dreams
,
of
phrases
spoken
in
nightmares
.
Soul
!
If
anybody
ever
struggled
*NL*
with
a
soul
,
I
am
the
man
.
And
I
was
n't
arguing
with
a
lunatic
either
.
*NL*
Believe
me
or
not
,
his
intelligence
was
perfectly
clear
--
concentrated
,
*NL*
it
is
true
,
upon
himself
with
horrible
intensity
,
yet
clear
;
and
therein
*NL*
was
my
only
chance
--
barring
,
of
course
,
the
killing
him
there
and
then
,
*NL*
which
was
n't
so
good
,
on
account
of
unavoidable
noise
.
But
his
soul
was
*NL*
mad
.
Being
alone
in
the
wilderness
,
it
had
looked
within
itself
,
and
,
by
*NL*
heavens
!
I
tell
you
,
it
had
gone
mad
.
I
had
--
for
my
sins
,
I
suppose
--
to
*NL*
go
through
the
ordeal
of
looking
into
it
myself
.
No
eloquence
could
*NL*
have
been
so
withering
to
one
's
belief
in
mankind
as
his
final
burst
of
*NL*
sincerity
.
He
struggled
with
himself
,
too
.
I
saw
it
--
I
heard
it
.
I
saw
*NL*
the
inconceivable
mystery
of
a
soul
that
knew
no
restraint
,
no
faith
,
*NL*
and
no
fear
,
yet
struggling
blindly
with
itself
.
I
kept
my
head
pretty
*NL*
well
;
but
when
I
had
him
at
last
stretched
on
the
couch
,
I
wiped
my
*NL*
forehead
,
while
my
legs
shook
under
me
as
though
I
had
carried
half
a
*NL*
ton
on
my
back
down
that
hill
.
And
yet
I
had
only
supported
him
,
his
*NL*
bony
arm
clasped
round
my
neck
--
and
he
was
not
much
heavier
than
a
*NL*
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
next
day
we
left
at
noon
,
the
crowd
,
of
whose
presence
behind
the
*NL*
curtain
of
trees
I
had
been
acutely
conscious
all
the
time
,
flowed
out
*NL*
of
the
woods
again
,
filled
the
clearing
,
covered
the
slope
with
a
mass
*NL*
of
naked
,
breathing
,
quivering
,
bronze
bodies
.
I
steamed
up
a
bit
,
then
*NL*
swung
down
stream
,
and
two
thousand
eyes
followed
the
evolutions
of
*NL*
the
splashing
,
thumping
,
fierce
river-demon
beating
the
water
with
its
*NL*
terrible
tail
and
breathing
black
smoke
into
the
air
.
In
front
of
the
*NL*
first
rank
,
along
the
river
,
three
men
,
plastered
with
bright
red
earth
*NL*
from
head
to
foot
,
strutted
to
and
fro
restlessly
.
When
we
came
abreast
*NL*
again
,
they
faced
the
river
,
stamped
their
feet
,
nodded
their
horned
*NL*
heads
,
swayed
their
scarlet
bodies
;
they
shook
towards
the
fierce
*NL*
river-demon
a
bunch
of
black
feathers
,
a
mangy
skin
with
a
pendent
*NL*
tail
--
something
that
looked
a
dried
gourd
;
they
shouted
periodically
*NL*
together
strings
of
amazing
words
that
resembled
no
sounds
of
human
*NL*
language
;
and
the
deep
murmurs
of
the
crowd
,
interrupted
suddenly
,
were
*NL*
like
the
responses
of
some
satanic
litany
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
carried
Kurtz
into
the
pilot-house
:
there
was
more
air
there
.
*NL*
Lying
on
the
couch
,
he
stared
through
the
open
shutter
.
There
was
an
*NL*
eddy
in
the
mass
of
human
bodies
,
and
the
woman
with
helmeted
head
and
*NL*
tawny
cheeks
rushed
out
to
the
very
brink
of
the
stream
.
She
put
out
her
*NL*
hands
,
shouted
something
,
and
all
that
wild
mob
took
up
the
shout
in
a
*NL*
roaring
chorus
of
articulated
,
rapid
,
breathless
utterance
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
you
understand
this
?
'
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
kept
on
looking
out
past
me
with
fiery
,
longing
eyes
,
with
a
mingled
*NL*
expression
of
wistfulness
and
hate
.
He
made
no
answer
,
but
I
saw
a
*NL*
smile
,
a
smile
of
indefinable
meaning
,
appear
on
his
colourless
lips
*NL*
that
a
moment
after
twitched
convulsively
.
`
Do
I
not
?
'
he
said
slowly
,
*NL*
gasping
,
as
if
the
words
had
been
torn
out
of
him
by
a
supernatural
*NL*
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pulled
the
string
of
the
whistle
,
and
I
did
this
because
I
saw
the
*NL*
pilgrims
on
deck
getting
out
their
rifles
with
an
air
of
anticipating
a
*NL*
jolly
lark
.
At
the
sudden
screech
there
was
a
movement
of
abject
terror
*NL*
through
that
wedged
mass
of
bodies
.
`
Do
n't
!
do
n't
you
frighten
them
*NL*
away
,
'
cried
some
one
on
deck
disconsolately
.
I
pulled
the
string
*NL*
time
after
time
.
They
broke
and
ran
,
they
leaped
,
they
crouched
,
they
*NL*
swerved
,
they
dodged
the
flying
terror
of
the
sound
.
The
three
red
chaps
*NL*
had
fallen
flat
,
face
down
on
the
shore
,
as
though
they
had
been
shot
*NL*
dead
.
Only
the
barbarous
and
superb
woman
did
not
so
much
as
flinch
,
*NL*
and
stretched
tragically
her
bare
arms
after
us
over
the
sombre
and
*NL*
glittering
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
that
imbecile
crowd
down
on
the
deck
started
their
little
fun
,
*NL*
and
I
could
see
nothing
more
for
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
brown
current
ran
swiftly
out
of
the
heart
of
darkness
,
bearing
us
*NL*
down
towards
the
sea
with
twice
the
speed
of
our
upward
progress
;
and
*NL*
Kurtz
's
life
was
running
swiftly
,
too
,
ebbing
,
ebbing
out
of
his
heart
*NL*
into
the
sea
of
inexorable
time
.
The
manager
was
very
placid
,
he
had
*NL*
no
vital
anxieties
now
,
he
took
us
both
in
with
a
comprehensive
and
*NL*
satisfied
glance
:
the
`
affair
'
had
come
off
as
well
as
could
be
wished
.
*NL*
I
saw
the
time
approaching
when
I
would
be
left
alone
of
the
party
of
*NL*
`
unsound
method
.
'
The
pilgrims
looked
upon
me
with
disfavour
.
I
was
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
,
numbered
with
the
dead
.
It
is
strange
how
I
accepted
this
*NL*
unforeseen
partnership
,
this
choice
of
nightmares
forced
upon
me
in
the
*NL*
tenebrous
land
invaded
by
these
mean
and
greedy
phantoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kurtz
discoursed
.
A
voice
!
a
voice
!
It
rang
deep
to
the
very
last
.
It
*NL*
survived
his
strength
to
hide
in
the
magnificent
folds
of
eloquence
the
*NL*
barren
darkness
of
his
heart
.
Oh
,
he
struggled
!
he
struggled
!
The
wastes
*NL*
of
his
weary
brain
were
haunted
by
shadowy
images
now
--
images
of
wealth
*NL*
and
fame
revolving
obsequiously
round
his
unextinguishable
gift
of
noble
*NL*
and
lofty
expression
.
My
Intended
,
my
station
,
my
career
,
my
*NL*
ideas
--
these
were
the
subjects
for
the
occasional
utterances
of
elevated
*NL*
sentiments
.
The
shade
of
the
original
Kurtz
frequented
the
bedside
of
*NL*
the
hollow
sham
,
whose
fate
it
was
to
be
buried
presently
in
the
mould
*NL*
of
primeval
earth
.
But
both
the
diabolic
love
and
the
unearthly
hate
of
*NL*
the
mysteries
it
had
penetrated
fought
for
the
possession
of
that
*NL*
soul
satiated
with
primitive
emotions
,
avid
of
lying
fame
,
of
sham
*NL*
distinction
,
of
all
the
appearances
of
success
and
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
he
was
contemptibly
childish
.
He
desired
to
have
kings
meet
*NL*
him
at
railway-stations
on
his
return
from
some
ghastly
Nowhere
,
where
*NL*
he
intended
to
accomplish
great
things
.
`
You
show
them
you
have
in
you
*NL*
something
that
is
really
profitable
,
and
then
there
will
be
no
limits
to
*NL*
the
recognition
of
your
ability

he
would
say
.
`
Of
course
you
must
take
*NL*
care
of
the
motives
--
right
motives
--
always

'
The
long
reaches
that
were
*NL*
like
one
and
the
same
reach
,
monotonous
bends
that
were
exactly
alike
,
*NL*
slipped
past
the
steamer
with
their
multitude
of
secular
trees
looking
*NL*
patiently
after
this
grimy
fragment
of
another
world
,
the
forerunner
*NL*
of
change
,
of
conquest
,
of
trade
,
of
massacres
,
of
blessings

I
looked
*NL*
ahead
--
piloting
.
`
Close
the
shutter
,
'
said
Kurtz
suddenly
one
day
;
'
I
*NL*
ca
n't
bear
to
look
at
this
.
'
I
did
so
.
There
was
a
silence
.
`
Oh
,
but
I
*NL*
will
wring
your
heart
yet
!

he
cried
at
the
invisible
wilderness

*NL*
``
We
broke
down
--
as
I
had
expected
--
and
had
to
lie
up
for
repairs
at
the
*NL*
head
of
an
island
.
This
delay
was
the
first
thing
that
shook
Kurtz
's
*NL*
confidence
.
One
morning
he
gave
me
a
packet
of
papers
and
a
*NL*
photograph
--
the
lot
tied
together
with
a
shoe-string
.
`
Keep
this
for
*NL*
me
,
'
he
said
.
`
This
noxious
fool
'
-LRB-
meaning
the
manager
-RRB-
`
is
capable
of
*NL*
prying
into
my
boxes
when
I
am
not
looking
.
'
In
the
afternoon
I
saw
him
.
*NL*
He
was
lying
on
his
back
with
closed
eyes
,
and
I
withdrew
quietly
,
but
I
*NL*
heard
him
mutter
,
`
Live
rightly
,
die
,
die
...
'
I
listened
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
more
.
Was
he
rehearsing
some
speech
in
his
sleep
,
or
was
it
a
*NL*
fragment
of
a
phrase
from
some
newspaper
article
?
He
had
been
writing
*NL*
for
the
papers
and
meant
to
do
so
again
,
`
for
the
furthering
of
my
*NL*
ideas
.
It
's
a
duty
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
was
an
impenetrable
darkness
.
I
looked
at
him
as
you
peer
down
at
*NL*
a
man
who
is
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
precipice
where
the
sun
never
*NL*
shines
.
But
I
had
not
much
time
to
give
him
,
because
I
was
helping
the
*NL*
engine-driver
to
take
to
pieces
the
leaky
cylinders
,
to
straighten
a
*NL*
bent
connecting-rod
,
and
in
other
such
matters
.
I
lived
in
an
*NL*
infernal
mess
of
rust
,
filings
,
nuts
,
bolts
,
spanners
,
hammers
,
*NL*
ratchet-drills
--
things
I
abominate
,
because
I
do
n't
get
on
with
them
.
I
*NL*
tended
the
little
forge
we
fortunately
had
aboard
;
I
toiled
wearily
in
a
*NL*
wretched
scrap-heap
--
unless
I
had
the
shakes
too
bad
to
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
evening
coming
in
with
a
candle
I
was
startled
to
hear
him
say
a
*NL*
little
tremulously
,
'
I
am
lying
here
in
the
dark
waiting
for
death
.
'
*NL*
The
light
was
within
a
foot
of
his
eyes
.
I
forced
myself
to
murmur
,
`
Oh
,
*NL*
nonsense
!
'
and
stood
over
him
as
if
transfixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
approaching
the
change
that
came
over
his
features
I
have
*NL*
never
seen
before
,
and
hope
never
to
see
again
.
Oh
,
I
was
n't
touched
.
*NL*
I
was
fascinated
.
It
was
as
though
a
veil
had
been
rent
.
I
saw
on
that
*NL*
ivory
face
the
expression
of
sombre
pride
,
of
ruthless
power
,
of
craven
*NL*
terror
--
of
an
intense
and
hopeless
despair
.
Did
he
live
his
life
again
*NL*
in
every
detail
of
desire
,
temptation
,
and
surrender
during
that
supreme
*NL*
moment
of
complete
knowledge
?
He
cried
in
a
whisper
at
some
image
,
at
*NL*
some
vision
--
he
cried
out
twice
,
a
cry
that
was
no
more
than
a
breath
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
horror
!
The
horror
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
blew
the
candle
out
and
left
the
cabin
.
The
pilgrims
were
dining
in
*NL*
the
mess-room
,
and
I
took
my
place
opposite
the
manager
,
who
lifted
his
*NL*
eyes
to
give
me
a
questioning
glance
,
which
I
successfully
ignored
.
*NL*
He
leaned
back
,
serene
,
with
that
peculiar
smile
of
his
sealing
the
*NL*
unexpressed
depths
of
his
meanness
.
A
continuous
shower
of
small
flies
*NL*
streamed
upon
the
lamp
,
upon
the
cloth
,
upon
our
hands
and
faces
.
*NL*
Suddenly
the
manager
's
boy
put
his
insolent
black
head
in
the
doorway
,
*NL*
and
said
in
a
tone
of
scathing
contempt
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Mistah
Kurtz
--
he
dead
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
pilgrims
rushed
out
to
see
.
I
remained
,
and
went
on
with
my
*NL*
dinner
.
I
believe
I
was
considered
brutally
callous
.
However
,
I
did
not
*NL*
eat
much
.
There
was
a
lamp
in
there
--
light
,
do
n't
you
know
--
and
outside
*NL*
it
was
so
beastly
,
beastly
dark
.
I
went
no
more
near
the
remarkable
man
*NL*
who
had
pronounced
a
judgment
upon
the
adventures
of
his
soul
on
this
*NL*
earth
.
The
voice
was
gone
.
What
else
had
been
there
?
But
I
am
of
course
*NL*
aware
that
next
day
the
pilgrims
buried
something
in
a
muddy
hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
they
very
nearly
buried
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
as
you
see
,
I
did
not
go
to
join
Kurtz
there
and
then
.
I
did
*NL*
not
.
I
remained
to
dream
the
nightmare
out
to
the
end
,
and
to
show
my
*NL*
loyalty
to
Kurtz
once
more
.
Destiny
.
My
destiny
!
Droll
thing
life
*NL*
is
--
that
mysterious
arrangement
of
merciless
logic
for
a
futile
purpose
.
*NL*
The
most
you
can
hope
from
it
is
some
knowledge
of
yourself
--
that
comes
*NL*
too
late
--
a
crop
of
unextinguishable
regrets
.
I
have
wrestled
with
*NL*
death
.
It
is
the
most
unexciting
contest
you
can
imagine
.
It
takes
place
*NL*
in
an
impalpable
greyness
,
with
nothing
underfoot
,
with
nothing
around
,
*NL*
without
spectators
,
without
clamour
,
without
glory
,
without
the
great
*NL*
desire
of
victory
,
without
the
great
fear
of
defeat
,
in
a
sickly
*NL*
atmosphere
of
tepid
scepticism
,
without
much
belief
in
your
own
right
,
*NL*
and
still
less
in
that
of
your
adversary
.
If
such
is
the
form
of
*NL*
ultimate
wisdom
,
then
life
is
a
greater
riddle
than
some
of
us
think
it
*NL*
to
be
.
I
was
within
a
hair
's
breadth
of
the
last
opportunity
for
*NL*
pronouncement
,
and
I
found
with
humiliation
that
probably
I
would
have
*NL*
nothing
to
say
.
This
is
the
reason
why
I
affirm
that
Kurtz
was
a
*NL*
remarkable
man
.
He
had
something
to
say
.
He
said
it
.
Since
I
had
peeped
*NL*
over
the
edge
myself
,
I
understand
better
the
meaning
of
his
stare
,
that
*NL*
could
not
see
the
flame
of
the
candle
,
but
was
wide
enough
to
embrace
*NL*
the
whole
universe
,
piercing
enough
to
penetrate
all
the
hearts
that
*NL*
beat
in
the
darkness
.
He
had
summed
up
--
he
had
judged
.
`
The
horror
!
'
He
*NL*
was
a
remarkable
man
.
After
all
,
this
was
the
expression
of
some
sort
of
*NL*
belief
;
it
had
candour
,
it
had
conviction
,
it
had
a
vibrating
note
of
*NL*
revolt
in
its
whisper
,
it
had
the
appalling
face
of
a
glimpsed
*NL*
truth
--
the
strange
commingling
of
desire
and
hate
.
And
it
is
not
my
own
*NL*
extremity
I
remember
best
--
a
vision
of
greyness
without
form
filled
*NL*
with
physical
pain
,
and
a
careless
contempt
for
the
evanescence
of
all
*NL*
things
--
even
of
this
pain
itself
.
No
!
It
is
his
extremity
that
I
seem
to
*NL*
have
lived
through
.
True
,
he
had
made
that
last
stride
,
he
had
stepped
*NL*
over
the
edge
,
while
I
had
been
permitted
to
draw
back
my
hesitating
*NL*
foot
.
And
perhaps
in
this
is
the
whole
difference
;
perhaps
all
the
*NL*
wisdom
,
and
all
truth
,
and
all
sincerity
,
are
just
compressed
into
that
*NL*
inappreciable
moment
of
time
in
which
we
step
over
the
threshold
of
the
*NL*
invisible
.
Perhaps
!
I
like
to
think
my
summing-up
would
not
have
been
a
*NL*
word
of
careless
contempt
.
Better
his
cry
--
much
better
.
It
was
an
*NL*
affirmation
,
a
moral
victory
paid
for
by
innumerable
defeats
,
by
*NL*
abominable
terrors
,
by
abominable
satisfactions
.
But
it
was
a
victory
!
*NL*
That
is
why
I
have
remained
loyal
to
Kurtz
to
the
last
,
and
even
beyond
,
*NL*
when
a
long
time
after
I
heard
once
more
,
not
his
own
voice
,
but
the
*NL*
echo
of
his
magnificent
eloquence
thrown
to
me
from
a
soul
as
*NL*
translucently
pure
as
a
cliff
of
crystal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
did
not
bury
me
,
though
there
is
a
period
of
time
which
I
*NL*
remember
mistily
,
with
a
shuddering
wonder
,
like
a
passage
through
some
*NL*
inconceivable
world
that
had
no
hope
in
it
and
no
desire
.
I
found
myself
*NL*
back
in
the
sepulchral
city
resenting
the
sight
of
people
hurrying
*NL*
through
the
streets
to
filch
a
little
money
from
each
other
,
to
devour
*NL*
their
infamous
cookery
,
to
gulp
their
unwholesome
beer
,
to
dream
their
*NL*
insignificant
and
silly
dreams
.
They
trespassed
upon
my
thoughts
.
They
*NL*
were
intruders
whose
knowledge
of
life
was
to
me
an
irritating
pretence
,
*NL*
because
I
felt
so
sure
they
could
not
possibly
know
the
things
I
knew
.
*NL*
Their
bearing
,
which
was
simply
the
bearing
of
commonplace
individuals
*NL*
going
about
their
business
in
the
assurance
of
perfect
safety
,
was
*NL*
offensive
to
me
like
the
outrageous
flauntings
of
folly
in
the
face
of
*NL*
a
danger
it
is
unable
to
comprehend
.
I
had
no
particular
desire
to
*NL*
enlighten
them
,
but
I
had
some
difficulty
in
restraining
myself
from
*NL*
laughing
in
their
faces
so
full
of
stupid
importance
.
I
daresay
I
was
*NL*
not
very
well
at
that
time
.
I
tottered
about
the
streets
--
there
were
*NL*
various
affairs
to
settle
--
grinning
bitterly
at
perfectly
respectable
*NL*
persons
.
I
admit
my
behaviour
was
inexcusable
,
but
then
my
temperature
*NL*
was
seldom
normal
in
these
days
.
My
dear
aunt
's
endeavours
to
`
nurse
up
*NL*
my
strength
'
seemed
altogether
beside
the
mark
.
It
was
not
my
strength
*NL*
that
wanted
nursing
,
it
was
my
imagination
that
wanted
soothing
.
I
kept
*NL*
the
bundle
of
papers
given
me
by
Kurtz
,
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
do
*NL*
with
it
.
His
mother
had
died
lately
,
watched
over
,
as
I
was
told
,
by
*NL*
his
Intended
.
A
clean-shaved
man
,
with
an
official
manner
and
wearing
*NL*
gold-rimmed
spectacles
,
called
on
me
one
day
and
made
inquiries
,
at
*NL*
first
circuitous
,
afterwards
suavely
pressing
,
about
what
he
was
pleased
*NL*
to
denominate
certain
`
documents
.
'
I
was
not
surprised
,
because
I
had
*NL*
had
two
rows
with
the
manager
on
the
subject
out
there
.
I
had
refused
*NL*
to
give
up
the
smallest
scrap
out
of
that
package
,
and
I
took
the
same
*NL*
attitude
with
the
spectacled
man
.
He
became
darkly
menacing
at
last
,
*NL*
and
with
much
heat
argued
that
the
Company
had
the
right
to
every
bit
of
*NL*
information
about
its
`
territories
.
'
And
said
he
,
`
Mr.
Kurtz
's
*NL*
knowledge
of
unexplored
regions
must
have
been
necessarily
extensive
*NL*
and
peculiar
--
owing
to
his
great
abilities
and
to
the
deplorable
*NL*
circumstances
in
which
he
had
been
placed
:
therefore
--
'
I
assured
him
*NL*
Mr.
Kurtz
's
knowledge
,
however
extensive
,
did
not
bear
upon
the
problems
*NL*
of
commerce
or
administration
.
He
invoked
then
the
name
of
science
.
`
It
*NL*
would
be
an
incalculable
loss
if
,
'
etc.
,
etc.
.
I
offered
him
the
report
*NL*
on
the
`
Suppression
of
Savage
Customs
,
'
with
the
postscriptum
torn
*NL*
off
.
He
took
it
up
eagerly
,
but
ended
by
sniffing
at
it
with
an
air
*NL*
of
contempt
.
`
This
is
not
what
we
had
a
right
to
expect
,
'
he
remarked
.
*NL*
`
Expect
nothing
else
,
'
I
said
.
`
There
are
only
private
letters
.
'
He
*NL*
withdrew
upon
some
threat
of
legal
proceedings
,
and
I
saw
him
no
more
;
*NL*
but
another
fellow
,
calling
himself
Kurtz
's
cousin
,
appeared
two
days
*NL*
later
,
and
was
anxious
to
hear
all
the
details
about
his
dear
relative
's
*NL*
last
moments
.
Incidentally
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
Kurtz
had
*NL*
been
essentially
a
great
musician
.
`
There
was
the
making
of
an
immense
*NL*
success
,
'
said
the
man
,
who
was
an
organist
,
I
believe
,
with
lank
grey
*NL*
hair
flowing
over
a
greasy
coat-collar
.
I
had
no
reason
to
doubt
*NL*
his
statement
;
and
to
this
day
I
am
unable
to
say
what
was
Kurtz
's
*NL*
profession
,
whether
he
ever
had
any
--
which
was
the
greatest
of
his
*NL*
talents
.
I
had
taken
him
for
a
painter
who
wrote
for
the
papers
,
or
else
*NL*
for
a
journalist
who
could
paint
--
but
even
the
cousin
-LRB-
who
took
snuff
*NL*
during
the
interview
-RRB-
could
not
tell
me
what
he
had
been
--
exactly
.
He
*NL*
was
a
universal
genius
--
on
that
point
I
agreed
with
the
old
chap
,
who
*NL*
thereupon
blew
his
nose
noisily
into
a
large
cotton
handkerchief
and
*NL*
withdrew
in
senile
agitation
,
bearing
off
some
family
letters
and
*NL*
memoranda
without
importance
.
Ultimately
a
journalist
anxious
to
know
*NL*
something
of
the
fate
of
his
`
dear
colleague
'
turned
up
.
This
visitor
*NL*
informed
me
Kurtz
's
proper
sphere
ought
to
have
been
politics
`
on
the
*NL*
popular
side
.
'
He
had
furry
straight
eyebrows
,
bristly
hair
cropped
*NL*
short
,
an
eyeglass
on
a
broad
ribbon
,
and
,
becoming
expansive
,
confessed
*NL*
his
opinion
that
Kurtz
really
could
n't
write
a
bit
--
`
but
heavens
!
how
*NL*
that
man
could
talk
.
He
electrified
large
meetings
.
He
had
faith
--
do
n't
*NL*
you
see
?
--
he
had
the
faith
.
He
could
get
himself
to
believe
*NL*
anything
--
anything
.
He
would
have
been
a
splendid
leader
of
an
extreme
*NL*
party
.
'
`
What
party
?
'
I
asked
.
`
Any
party
,
'
answered
the
other
.
`
He
*NL*
was
an
--
an
--
extremist
.
'
Did
I
not
think
so
?
I
assented
.
Did
I
know
,
he
*NL*
asked
,
with
a
sudden
flash
of
curiosity
,
`
what
it
was
that
had
induced
*NL*
him
to
go
out
there
?
'
`
Yes
,
'
said
I
,
and
forthwith
handed
him
the
*NL*
famous
Report
for
publication
,
if
he
thought
fit
.
He
glanced
through
it
*NL*
hurriedly
,
mumbling
all
the
time
,
judged
`
it
would
do
,
'
and
took
himself
*NL*
off
with
this
plunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
I
was
left
at
last
with
a
slim
packet
of
letters
and
the
girl
's
*NL*
portrait
.
She
struck
me
as
beautiful
--
I
mean
she
had
a
beautiful
*NL*
expression
.
I
know
that
the
sunlight
can
be
made
to
lie
,
too
,
yet
one
*NL*
felt
that
no
manipulation
of
light
and
pose
could
have
conveyed
the
*NL*
delicate
shade
of
truthfulness
upon
those
features
.
She
seemed
ready
to
*NL*
listen
without
mental
reservation
,
without
suspicion
,
without
a
thought
*NL*
for
herself
.
I
concluded
I
would
go
and
give
her
back
her
portrait
*NL*
and
those
letters
myself
.
Curiosity
?
Yes
;
and
also
some
other
feeling
*NL*
perhaps
.
All
that
had
been
Kurtz
's
had
passed
out
of
my
hands
:
his
soul
,
*NL*
his
body
,
his
station
,
his
plans
,
his
ivory
,
his
career
.
There
remained
*NL*
only
his
memory
and
his
Intended
--
and
I
wanted
to
give
that
up
,
too
,
*NL*
to
the
past
,
in
a
way
--
to
surrender
personally
all
that
remained
of
him
*NL*
with
me
to
that
oblivion
which
is
the
last
word
of
our
common
fate
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
defend
myself
.
I
had
no
clear
perception
of
what
it
was
I
really
*NL*
wanted
.
Perhaps
it
was
an
impulse
of
unconscious
loyalty
,
or
the
*NL*
fulfilment
of
one
of
those
ironic
necessities
that
lurk
in
the
facts
of
*NL*
human
existence
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
ca
n't
tell
.
But
I
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
his
memory
was
like
the
other
memories
of
the
dead
that
*NL*
accumulate
in
every
man
's
life
--
a
vague
impress
on
the
brain
of
shadows
*NL*
that
had
fallen
on
it
in
their
swift
and
final
passage
;
but
before
the
*NL*
high
and
ponderous
door
,
between
the
tall
houses
of
a
street
as
still
*NL*
and
decorous
as
a
well-kept
alley
in
a
cemetery
,
I
had
a
vision
of
him
*NL*
on
the
stretcher
,
opening
his
mouth
voraciously
,
as
if
to
devour
all
the
*NL*
earth
with
all
its
mankind
.
He
lived
then
before
me
;
he
lived
as
much
*NL*
as
he
had
ever
lived
--
a
shadow
insatiable
of
splendid
appearances
,
of
*NL*
frightful
realities
;
a
shadow
darker
than
the
shadow
of
the
night
,
and
*NL*
draped
nobly
in
the
folds
of
a
gorgeous
eloquence
.
The
vision
seemed
to
*NL*
enter
the
house
with
me
--
the
stretcher
,
the
phantom-bearers
,
the
wild
*NL*
crowd
of
obedient
worshippers
,
the
gloom
of
the
forests
,
the
glitter
*NL*
of
the
reach
between
the
murky
bends
,
the
beat
of
the
drum
,
regular
and
*NL*
muffled
like
the
beating
of
a
heart
--
the
heart
of
a
conquering
darkness
.
*NL*
It
was
a
moment
of
triumph
for
the
wilderness
,
an
invading
and
vengeful
*NL*
rush
which
,
it
seemed
to
me
,
I
would
have
to
keep
back
alone
for
the
*NL*
salvation
of
another
soul
.
And
the
memory
of
what
I
had
heard
him
say
*NL*
afar
there
,
with
the
horned
shapes
stirring
at
my
back
,
in
the
glow
of
*NL*
fires
,
within
the
patient
woods
,
those
broken
phrases
came
back
to
*NL*
me
,
were
heard
again
in
their
ominous
and
terrifying
simplicity
.
I
*NL*
remembered
his
abject
pleading
,
his
abject
threats
,
the
colossal
scale
*NL*
of
his
vile
desires
,
the
meanness
,
the
torment
,
the
tempestuous
anguish
*NL*
of
his
soul
.
And
later
on
I
seemed
to
see
his
collected
languid
manner
,
*NL*
when
he
said
one
day
,
`
This
lot
of
ivory
now
is
really
mine
.
The
Company
*NL*
did
not
pay
for
it
.
I
collected
it
myself
at
a
very
great
personal
risk
.
*NL*
I
am
afraid
they
will
try
to
claim
it
as
theirs
though
.
H
'm
.
It
is
a
*NL*
difficult
case
.
What
do
you
think
I
ought
to
do
--
resist
?
Eh
?
I
want
no
*NL*
more
than
justice
.
'
...
He
wanted
no
more
than
justice
--
no
more
than
*NL*
justice
.
I
rang
the
bell
before
a
mahogany
door
on
the
first
floor
,
and
*NL*
while
I
waited
he
seemed
to
stare
at
me
out
of
the
glassy
panel
--
stare
*NL*
with
that
wide
and
immense
stare
embracing
,
condemning
,
loathing
all
the
*NL*
universe
.
I
seemed
to
hear
the
whispered
cry
,
``
The
horror
!
The
horror
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dusk
was
falling
.
I
had
to
wait
in
a
lofty
drawing-room
with
three
*NL*
long
windows
from
floor
to
ceiling
that
were
like
three
luminous
and
*NL*
bedraped
columns
.
The
bent
gilt
legs
and
backs
of
the
furniture
shone
in
*NL*
indistinct
curves
.
The
tall
marble
fireplace
had
a
cold
and
monumental
*NL*
whiteness
.
A
grand
piano
stood
massively
in
a
corner
;
with
dark
gleams
*NL*
on
the
flat
surfaces
like
a
sombre
and
polished
sarcophagus
.
A
high
door
*NL*
opened
--
closed
.
I
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
came
forward
,
all
in
black
,
with
a
pale
head
,
floating
towards
*NL*
me
in
the
dusk
.
She
was
in
mourning
.
It
was
more
than
a
year
since
his
*NL*
death
,
more
than
a
year
since
the
news
came
;
she
seemed
as
though
she
*NL*
would
remember
and
mourn
forever
.
She
took
both
my
hands
in
hers
and
*NL*
murmured
,
'
I
had
heard
you
were
coming
.
'
I
noticed
she
was
not
very
*NL*
young
--
I
mean
not
girlish
.
She
had
a
mature
capacity
for
fidelity
,
for
*NL*
belief
,
for
suffering
.
The
room
seemed
to
have
grown
darker
,
as
if
all
*NL*
the
sad
light
of
the
cloudy
evening
had
taken
refuge
on
her
forehead
.
*NL*
This
fair
hair
,
this
pale
visage
,
this
pure
brow
,
seemed
surrounded
by
*NL*
an
ashy
halo
from
which
the
dark
eyes
looked
out
at
me
.
Their
glance
was
*NL*
guileless
,
profound
,
confident
,
and
trustful
.
She
carried
her
sorrowful
*NL*
head
as
though
she
were
proud
of
that
sorrow
,
as
though
she
would
say
,
*NL*
`
I
--
I
alone
know
how
to
mourn
for
him
as
he
deserves
.
'
But
while
we
were
*NL*
still
shaking
hands
,
such
a
look
of
awful
desolation
came
upon
her
*NL*
face
that
I
perceived
she
was
one
of
those
creatures
that
are
not
the
*NL*
playthings
of
Time
.
For
her
he
had
died
only
yesterday
.
And
,
by
Jove
!
*NL*
the
impression
was
so
powerful
that
for
me
,
too
,
he
seemed
to
have
died
*NL*
only
yesterday
--
nay
,
this
very
minute
.
I
saw
her
and
him
in
the
same
*NL*
instant
of
time
--
his
death
and
her
sorrow
--
I
saw
her
sorrow
in
the
very
*NL*
moment
of
his
death
.
Do
you
understand
?
I
saw
them
together
--
I
heard
*NL*
them
together
.
She
had
said
,
with
a
deep
catch
of
the
breath
,
'
I
have
*NL*
survived
'
while
my
strained
ears
seemed
to
hear
distinctly
,
mingled
with
*NL*
her
tone
of
despairing
regret
,
the
summing
up
whisper
of
his
eternal
*NL*
condemnation
.
I
asked
myself
what
I
was
doing
there
,
with
a
sensation
*NL*
of
panic
in
my
heart
as
though
I
had
blundered
into
a
place
of
cruel
and
*NL*
absurd
mysteries
not
fit
for
a
human
being
to
behold
.
She
motioned
me
to
*NL*
a
chair
.
We
sat
down
.
I
laid
the
packet
gently
on
the
little
table
,
and
*NL*
she
put
her
hand
over
it
...
`
You
knew
him
well
,
'
she
murmured
,
after
*NL*
a
moment
of
mourning
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Intimacy
grows
quickly
out
there
,
'
I
said
.
'
I
knew
him
as
well
as
it
*NL*
is
possible
for
one
man
to
know
another
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
you
admired
him
,
'
she
said
.
`
It
was
impossible
to
know
him
and
not
*NL*
to
admire
him
.
Was
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
He
was
a
remarkable
man
,
'
I
said
,
unsteadily
.
Then
before
the
*NL*
appealing
fixity
of
her
gaze
,
that
seemed
to
watch
for
more
words
on
my
*NL*
lips
,
I
went
on
,
`
It
was
impossible
not
to
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Love
him
,
'
she
finished
eagerly
,
silencing
me
into
an
appalled
*NL*
dumbness
.
`
How
true
!
how
true
!
But
when
you
think
that
no
one
knew
him
*NL*
so
well
as
I
!
I
had
all
his
noble
confidence
.
I
knew
him
best
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You
knew
him
best
,
'
I
repeated
.
And
perhaps
she
did
.
But
with
every
*NL*
word
spoken
the
room
was
growing
darker
,
and
only
her
forehead
,
smooth
*NL*
and
white
,
remained
illumined
by
the
inextinguishable
light
of
belief
*NL*
and
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You
were
his
friend
,
'
she
went
on
.
`
His
friend
,
'
she
repeated
,
a
*NL*
little
louder
.
`
You
must
have
been
,
if
he
had
given
you
this
,
and
sent
*NL*
you
to
me
.
I
feel
I
can
speak
to
you
--
and
oh
!
I
must
speak
.
I
want
*NL*
you
--
you
who
have
heard
his
last
words
--
to
know
I
have
been
worthy
of
*NL*
him
...
It
is
not
pride
...
Yes
!
I
am
proud
to
know
I
understood
*NL*
him
better
than
any
one
on
earth
--
he
told
me
so
himself
.
And
since
his
*NL*
mother
died
I
have
had
no
one
--
no
one
--
to
--
to
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
listened
.
The
darkness
deepened
.
I
was
not
even
sure
whether
he
had
*NL*
given
me
the
right
bundle
.
I
rather
suspect
he
wanted
me
to
take
care
*NL*
of
another
batch
of
his
papers
which
,
after
his
death
,
I
saw
the
manager
*NL*
examining
under
the
lamp
.
And
the
girl
talked
,
easing
her
pain
in
the
*NL*
certitude
of
my
sympathy
;
she
talked
as
thirsty
men
drink
.
I
had
heard
*NL*
that
her
engagement
with
Kurtz
had
been
disapproved
by
her
people
.
He
*NL*
was
n't
rich
enough
or
something
.
And
indeed
I
do
n't
know
whether
he
had
*NL*
not
been
a
pauper
all
his
life
.
He
had
given
me
some
reason
to
infer
*NL*
that
it
was
his
impatience
of
comparative
poverty
that
drove
him
out
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
...
Who
was
not
his
friend
who
had
heard
him
speak
once
?
'
she
was
*NL*
saying
.
`
He
drew
men
towards
him
by
what
was
best
in
them
.
'
She
looked
*NL*
at
me
with
intensity
.
`
It
is
the
gift
of
the
great
,
'
she
went
on
,
and
*NL*
the
sound
of
her
low
voice
seemed
to
have
the
accompaniment
of
all
*NL*
the
other
sounds
,
full
of
mystery
,
desolation
,
and
sorrow
,
I
had
ever
*NL*
heard

the
ripple
of
the
river
,
the
soughing
of
the
trees
swayed
by
*NL*
the
wind
,
the
murmurs
of
the
crowds
,
the
faint
ring
of
incomprehensible
*NL*
words
cried
from
afar
,
the
whisper
of
a
voice
speaking
from
beyond
the
*NL*
threshold
of
an
eternal
darkness

But

have
heard
him

she
cried

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,

know

I
said
with
something
like
despair
in
my
heart

*NL*
bowing
my
head
before
the
faith
that
was
in
her

before
that
great
and
*NL*
saving
illusion
that
shone
with
an
unearthly
glow

the
darkness

the
triumphant
darkness

she
corrected
herself
with
beautiful
*NL*
generosity
;
then
added
in
a
murmur
,
`
To
the
world

By
the
last
gleams
*NL*
of
twilight
I
could
see
the
glitter

eyes

full
of
tears

of
tears

would
not

stood
up

`
His
end

said
I
,
with
dull
anger
stirring
in
me
,
`
was
in
every
way
*NL*
worthy
of
his
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
And
I
was
not
with
him
,
'
she
murmured
.
My
anger
subsided
before
a
*NL*
feeling
of
infinite
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Everything
that
could
be
done
--
'
I
mumbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Ah
,
but
I
believed
in
him
more
than
any
one
on
earth
--
more
than
his
*NL*
own
mother
,
more
than
--
himself
.
He
needed
me
!
Me
!
I
would
have
treasured
*NL*
every
sigh
,
every
word
,
every
sign
,
every
glance
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
like
a
chill
grip
on
my
chest
.
`
Do
n't
,
'
I
said
,
in
a
muffled
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Forgive
me
.
I
--
I
have
mourned
so
long
in
silence
--
in
silence
...
*NL*
You
were
with
him
--
to
the
last
?
I
think
of
his
loneliness
.
Nobody
near
*NL*
to
understand
him
as
I
would
have
understood
.
Perhaps
no
one
to
*NL*
hear
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
To
the
very
end
,
'
I
said
,
shakily
.
'
I
heard
his
very
last
words
...
'
*NL*
I
stopped
in
a
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Repeat
them
,
'
she
murmured
in
a
heart-broken
tone
.
'
I
want
--
I
*NL*
want
--
something
--
something
--
to
--
to
live
with
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
on
the
point
of
crying
at
her
,
`
Do
n't
you
hear
them
?
'
The
dusk
*NL*
was
repeating
them
in
a
persistent
whisper
all
around
us
,
in
a
whisper
*NL*
that
seemed
to
swell
menacingly
like
the
first
whisper
of
a
rising
wind
.
*NL*
`
The
horror
!
The
horror
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
His
last
word
--
to
live
with
,
'
she
insisted
.
`
Do
n't
you
understand
I
*NL*
loved
him
--
I
loved
him
--
I
loved
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pulled
myself
together
and
spoke
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
last
word
he
pronounced
was
--
your
name
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
a
light
sigh
and
then
my
heart
stood
still
,
stopped
dead
short
*NL*
by
an
exulting
and
terrible
cry
,
by
the
cry
of
inconceivable
triumph
and
*NL*
of
unspeakable
pain
.
'
I
knew
it
--
I
was
sure
!
'
...
She
knew
.
She
was
*NL*
sure
.
I
heard
her
weeping
;
she
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
hands
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
me
that
the
house
would
collapse
before
I
could
escape
,
that
*NL*
the
heavens
would
fall
upon
my
head
.
But
nothing
happened
.
The
heavens
*NL*
do
not
fall
for
such
a
trifle
.
Would
they
have
fallen
,
I
wonder
,
if
I
*NL*
had
rendered
Kurtz
that
justice
which
was
his
due
?
Had
n't
he
said
he
*NL*
wanted
only
justice
?
But
I
could
n't
.
I
could
not
tell
her
.
It
would
have
*NL*
been
too
dark
--
too
dark
altogether
...

*NL*
Marlow
ceased
,
and
sat
apart
,
indistinct
and
silent
,
in
the
pose
of
a
*NL*
meditating
Buddha
.
Nobody
moved
for
a
time
.
``
We
have
lost
the
first
of
*NL*
the
ebb
,
''
said
the
Director
suddenly
.
I
raised
my
head
.
The
offing
was
*NL*
barred
by
a
black
bank
of
clouds
,
and
the
tranquil
waterway
leading
to
*NL*
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
flowed
sombre
under
an
overcast
*NL*
sky
--
seemed
to
lead
into
the
heart
of
an
immense
darkness
.
