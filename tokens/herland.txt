CHAPTER
1
.
A
Not
Unnatural
Enterprise
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
written
from
memory
,
unfortunately
.
If
I
could
have
brought
with
*NL*
me
the
material
I
so
carefully
prepared
,
this
would
be
a
very
different
*NL*
story
.
Whole
books
full
of
notes
,
carefully
copied
records
,
firsthand
*NL*
descriptions
,
and
the
pictures
--
that
's
the
worst
loss
.
We
had
some
*NL*
bird
's
-
eyes
of
the
cities
and
parks
;
a
lot
of
lovely
views
of
streets
,
*NL*
of
buildings
,
outside
and
in
,
and
some
of
those
gorgeous
gardens
,
and
,
*NL*
most
important
of
all
,
of
the
women
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
will
ever
believe
how
they
looked
.
Descriptions
are
n't
any
good
*NL*
when
it
comes
to
women
,
and
I
never
was
good
at
descriptions
anyhow
.
But
*NL*
it
's
got
to
be
done
somehow
;
the
rest
of
the
world
needs
to
know
about
*NL*
that
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
n't
said
where
it
was
for
fear
some
self-appointed
missionaries
,
*NL*
or
traders
,
or
land-greedy
expansionists
,
will
take
it
upon
themselves
*NL*
to
push
in
.
They
will
not
be
wanted
,
I
can
tell
them
that
,
and
will
fare
*NL*
worse
than
we
did
if
they
do
find
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
this
way
.
There
were
three
of
us
,
classmates
and
friends
--
Terry
*NL*
O.
Nicholson
-LRB-
we
used
to
call
him
the
Old
Nick
,
with
good
reason
-RRB-
,
Jeff
*NL*
Margrave
,
and
I
,
Vandyck
Jennings
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
known
each
other
years
and
years
,
and
in
spite
of
our
differences
*NL*
we
had
a
good
deal
in
common
.
All
of
us
were
interested
in
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
rich
enough
to
do
as
he
pleased
.
His
great
aim
was
*NL*
exploration
.
He
used
to
make
all
kinds
of
a
row
because
there
was
*NL*
nothing
left
to
explore
now
,
only
patchwork
and
filling
in
,
he
said
.
He
*NL*
filled
in
well
enough
--
he
had
a
lot
of
talents
--
great
on
mechanics
and
*NL*
electricity
.
Had
all
kinds
of
boats
and
motorcars
,
and
was
one
of
the
*NL*
best
of
our
airmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
never
could
have
done
the
thing
at
all
without
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
Margrave
was
born
to
be
a
poet
,
a
botanist
--
or
both
--
but
his
folks
*NL*
persuaded
him
to
be
a
doctor
instead
.
He
was
a
good
one
,
for
his
age
,
*NL*
but
his
real
interest
was
in
what
he
loved
to
call
``
the
wonders
of
*NL*
science
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
me
,
sociology
's
my
major
.
You
have
to
back
that
up
with
a
lot
of
*NL*
other
sciences
,
of
course
.
I
'm
interested
in
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
strong
on
facts
--
geography
and
meteorology
and
those
;
Jeff
*NL*
could
beat
him
any
time
on
biology
,
and
I
did
n't
care
what
it
was
they
*NL*
talked
about
,
so
long
as
it
connected
with
human
life
,
somehow
.
There
*NL*
are
few
things
that
do
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
three
had
a
chance
to
join
a
big
scientific
expedition
.
They
needed
*NL*
a
doctor
,
and
that
gave
Jeff
an
excuse
for
dropping
his
just
opening
*NL*
practice
;
they
needed
Terry
's
experience
,
his
machine
,
and
his
money
;
*NL*
and
as
for
me
,
I
got
in
through
Terry
's
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
expedition
was
up
among
the
thousand
tributaries
and
enormous
*NL*
hinterland
of
a
great
river
,
up
where
the
maps
had
to
be
made
,
savage
*NL*
dialects
studied
,
and
all
manner
of
strange
flora
and
fauna
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
story
is
not
about
that
expedition
.
That
was
only
the
merest
*NL*
starter
for
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
interest
was
first
roused
by
talk
among
our
guides
.
I
'm
quick
at
*NL*
languages
,
know
a
good
many
,
and
pick
them
up
readily
.
What
with
that
*NL*
and
a
really
good
interpreter
we
took
with
us
,
I
made
out
quite
a
few
*NL*
legends
and
folk
myths
of
these
scattered
tribes
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
we
got
farther
and
farther
upstream
,
in
a
dark
tangle
of
rivers
,
*NL*
lakes
,
morasses
,
and
dense
forests
,
with
here
and
there
an
unexpected
*NL*
long
spur
running
out
from
the
big
mountains
beyond
,
I
noticed
that
more
*NL*
and
more
of
these
savages
had
a
story
about
a
strange
and
terrible
Woman
*NL*
Land
in
the
high
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
yonder
,
''
``
Over
there
,
''
``
Way
up
''
--
was
all
the
direction
they
could
*NL*
offer
,
but
their
legends
all
agreed
on
the
main
point
--
that
there
was
*NL*
this
strange
country
where
no
men
lived
--
only
women
and
girl
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
them
had
ever
seen
it
.
It
was
dangerous
,
deadly
,
they
said
,
for
*NL*
any
man
to
go
there
.
But
there
were
tales
of
long
ago
,
when
some
brave
*NL*
investigator
had
seen
it
--
a
Big
Country
,
Big
Houses
,
Plenty
People
--
All
*NL*
Women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
no
one
else
gone
?
Yes
--
a
good
many
--
but
they
never
came
back
.
It
was
*NL*
no
place
for
men
--
of
that
they
seemed
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
the
boys
about
these
stories
,
and
they
laughed
at
them
.
Naturally
*NL*
I
did
myself
.
I
knew
the
stuff
that
savage
dreams
are
made
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
we
had
reached
our
farthest
point
,
just
the
day
before
we
all
*NL*
had
to
turn
around
and
start
for
home
again
,
as
the
best
of
expeditions
*NL*
must
in
time
,
we
three
made
a
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
main
encampment
was
on
a
spit
of
land
running
out
into
the
main
*NL*
stream
,
or
what
we
thought
was
the
main
stream
.
It
had
the
same
muddy
*NL*
color
we
had
been
seeing
for
weeks
past
,
the
same
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
happened
to
speak
of
that
river
to
our
last
guide
,
a
rather
superior
*NL*
fellow
with
quick
,
bright
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
me
that
there
was
another
river
--
``
over
there
,
short
river
,
sweet
*NL*
water
,
red
and
blue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
interested
in
this
and
anxious
to
see
if
I
had
understood
,
so
I
*NL*
showed
him
a
red
and
blue
pencil
I
carried
,
and
asked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
he
pointed
to
the
river
,
and
then
to
the
southwestward
.
*NL*
``
River
--
good
water
--
red
and
blue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
close
by
and
interested
in
the
fellow
's
pointing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
say
,
Van
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
blazed
up
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
how
far
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
indicated
a
short
journey
;
I
judged
about
two
hours
,
maybe
*NL*
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
,
''
urged
Terry
.
``
Just
us
three
.
Maybe
we
can
really
find
*NL*
something
.
May
be
cinnabar
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
be
indigo
,
''
Jeff
suggested
,
with
his
lazy
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
early
yet
;
we
had
just
breakfasted
;
and
leaving
word
that
we
'd
*NL*
be
back
before
night
,
we
got
away
quietly
,
not
wishing
to
be
thought
*NL*
too
gullible
if
we
failed
,
and
secretly
hoping
to
have
some
nice
little
*NL*
discovery
all
to
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
two
hours
,
nearer
three
.
I
fancy
the
savage
could
have
*NL*
done
it
alone
much
quicker
.
There
was
a
desperate
tangle
of
wood
and
*NL*
water
and
a
swampy
patch
we
never
should
have
found
our
way
across
*NL*
alone
.
But
there
was
one
,
and
I
could
see
Terry
,
with
compass
and
*NL*
notebook
,
marking
directions
and
trying
to
place
landmarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
after
a
while
to
a
sort
of
marshy
lake
,
very
big
,
so
that
the
*NL*
circling
forest
looked
quite
low
and
dim
across
it
.
Our
guide
told
us
*NL*
that
boats
could
go
from
there
to
our
camp
--
but
``
long
way
--
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
water
was
somewhat
clearer
than
that
we
had
left
,
but
we
could
not
*NL*
judge
well
from
the
margin
.
We
skirted
it
for
another
half
hour
or
so
,
*NL*
the
ground
growing
firmer
as
we
advanced
,
and
presently
we
turned
the
*NL*
corner
of
a
wooded
promontory
and
saw
a
quite
different
country
--
a
*NL*
sudden
view
of
mountains
,
steep
and
bare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
those
long
easterly
spurs
,
''
Terry
said
appraisingly
.
``
May
be
*NL*
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
range
.
They
crop
out
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
we
left
the
lake
and
struck
directly
toward
the
cliffs
.
We
*NL*
heard
running
water
before
we
reached
it
,
and
the
guide
pointed
proudly
*NL*
to
his
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
short
.
We
could
see
where
it
poured
down
a
narrow
vertical
*NL*
cataract
from
an
opening
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
.
It
was
sweet
water
.
*NL*
The
guide
drank
eagerly
and
so
did
we
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
snow
water
,
''
Terry
announced
.
``
Must
come
from
way
back
in
the
*NL*
hills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
to
being
red
and
blue
--
it
was
greenish
in
tint
.
The
guide
seemed
*NL*
not
at
all
surprised
.
He
hunted
about
a
little
and
showed
us
a
quiet
*NL*
marginal
pool
where
there
were
smears
of
red
along
the
border
;
yes
,
and
*NL*
of
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
got
out
his
magnifying
glass
and
squatted
down
to
investigate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chemicals
of
some
sort
--
I
ca
n't
tell
on
the
spot
.
Look
to
me
like
*NL*
dyestuffs
.
Let
's
get
nearer
,
''
he
urged
,
``
up
there
by
the
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
scrambled
along
the
steep
banks
and
got
close
to
the
pool
that
foamed
*NL*
and
boiled
beneath
the
falling
water
.
Here
we
searched
the
border
and
*NL*
found
traces
of
color
beyond
dispute
.
More
--
Jeff
suddenly
held
up
an
*NL*
unlooked-for
trophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
a
rag
,
a
long
,
raveled
fragment
of
cloth
.
But
it
was
a
*NL*
well-woven
fabric
,
with
a
pattern
,
and
of
a
clear
scarlet
that
the
water
*NL*
had
not
faded
.
No
savage
tribe
that
we
had
heard
of
made
such
fabrics
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guide
stood
serenely
on
the
bank
,
well
pleased
with
our
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
blue
--
one
day
red
--
one
day
green
,
''
he
told
us
,
and
pulled
from
*NL*
his
pouch
another
strip
of
bright-hued
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
down
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
cataract
.
``
Woman
Country
--
up
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
were
interested
.
We
had
our
rest
and
lunch
right
there
and
*NL*
pumped
the
man
for
further
information
.
He
could
tell
us
only
what
the
*NL*
others
had
--
a
land
of
women
--
no
men
--
babies
,
but
all
girls
.
No
place
for
*NL*
men
--
dangerous
.
Some
had
gone
to
see
--
none
had
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
see
Terry
's
jaw
set
at
that
.
No
place
for
men
?
Dangerous
?
He
*NL*
looked
as
if
he
might
shin
up
the
waterfall
on
the
spot
.
But
the
guide
*NL*
would
not
hear
of
going
up
,
even
if
there
had
been
any
possible
method
*NL*
of
scaling
that
sheer
cliff
,
and
we
had
to
get
back
to
our
party
before
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
might
stay
if
we
told
them
,
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Terry
stopped
in
his
tracks
.
``
Look
here
,
fellows
,
''
he
said
.
``
This
*NL*
is
our
find
.
Let
's
not
tell
those
cocky
old
professors
.
Let
's
go
on
home
*NL*
with
'em
,
and
then
come
back
--
just
us
--
have
a
little
expedition
of
our
*NL*
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
at
him
,
much
impressed
.
There
was
something
attractive
to
a
*NL*
bunch
of
unattached
young
men
in
finding
an
undiscovered
country
of
a
*NL*
strictly
Amazonian
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
we
did
n't
believe
the
story
--
but
yet
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
such
cloth
made
by
any
of
these
local
tribes
,
''
I
announced
,
*NL*
examining
those
rags
with
great
care
.
``
Somewhere
up
yonder
they
spin
and
*NL*
weave
and
dye
--
as
well
as
we
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
mean
a
considerable
civilization
,
Van
.
There
could
n't
be
*NL*
such
a
place
--
and
not
known
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
What
's
that
old
republic
up
in
the
Pyrenees
*NL*
somewhere
--
Andorra
?
Precious
few
people
know
anything
about
that
,
and
*NL*
it
's
been
minding
its
own
business
for
a
thousand
years
.
Then
there
's
*NL*
Montenegro
--
splendid
little
state
--
you
could
lose
a
dozen
Montenegroes
*NL*
up
and
down
these
great
ranges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
discussed
it
hotly
all
the
way
back
to
camp
.
We
discussed
it
with
*NL*
care
and
privacy
on
the
voyage
home
.
We
discussed
it
after
that
,
still
*NL*
only
among
ourselves
,
while
Terry
was
making
his
arrangements
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
hot
about
it
.
Lucky
he
had
so
much
money
--
we
might
have
had
to
*NL*
beg
and
advertise
for
years
to
start
the
thing
,
and
then
it
would
have
*NL*
been
a
matter
of
public
amusement
--
just
sport
for
the
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
T.
O.
Nicholson
could
fix
up
his
big
steam
yacht
,
load
his
*NL*
specially-made
big
motorboat
aboard
,
and
tuck
in
a
``
dissembled
''
biplane
*NL*
without
any
more
notice
than
a
snip
in
the
society
column
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
provisions
and
preventives
and
all
manner
of
supplies
.
His
*NL*
previous
experience
stood
him
in
good
stead
there
.
It
was
a
very
*NL*
complete
little
outfit
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
to
leave
the
yacht
at
the
nearest
safe
port
and
go
up
that
*NL*
endless
river
in
our
motorboat
,
just
the
three
of
us
and
a
pilot
;
then
*NL*
drop
the
pilot
when
we
got
to
that
last
stopping
place
of
the
previous
*NL*
party
,
and
hunt
up
that
clear
water
stream
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
motorboat
we
were
going
to
leave
at
anchor
in
that
wide
shallow
*NL*
lake
.
It
had
a
special
covering
of
fitted
armor
,
thin
but
strong
,
shut
*NL*
up
like
a
clamshell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
natives
ca
n't
get
into
it
,
or
hurt
it
,
or
move
it
,
''
Terry
*NL*
explained
proudly
.
``
We
'll
start
our
flier
from
the
lake
and
leave
the
*NL*
boat
as
a
base
to
come
back
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
come
back
,
''
I
suggested
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Fraid
the
ladies
will
eat
you
?
''
he
scoffed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
not
so
sure
about
those
ladies
,
you
know
,
''
drawled
Jeff
.
``
There
*NL*
may
be
a
contingent
of
gentlemen
with
poisoned
arrows
or
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
need
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
,
''
Terry
remarked
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
?
You
'll
have
to
get
an
injunction
to
stop
me
!
''
Both
Jeff
and
I
were
*NL*
sure
about
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
did
have
differences
of
opinion
,
all
the
long
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
ocean
voyage
is
an
excellent
time
for
discussion
.
Now
we
had
no
*NL*
eavesdroppers
,
we
could
loll
and
loaf
in
our
deck
chairs
and
talk
and
*NL*
talk
--
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
.
Our
absolute
lack
of
facts
only
made
*NL*
the
field
of
discussion
wider
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
leave
papers
with
our
consul
where
the
yacht
stays
,
''
Terry
*NL*
planned
.
``
If
we
do
n't
come
back
in
--
say
a
month
--
they
can
send
a
relief
*NL*
party
after
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
punitive
expedition
,
''
I
urged
.
``
If
the
ladies
do
eat
us
we
must
make
*NL*
reprisals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
can
locate
that
last
stopping
place
easy
enough
,
and
I
've
made
a
*NL*
sort
of
chart
of
that
lake
and
cliff
and
waterfall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
how
will
they
get
up
?
''
asked
Jeff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Same
way
we
do
,
of
course
.
If
three
valuable
American
citizens
are
lost
*NL*
up
there
,
they
will
follow
somehow
--
to
say
nothing
of
the
glittering
*NL*
attractions
of
that
fair
land
--
let
's
call
it
`
Feminisia
,
'
''
he
broke
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
,
Terry
.
Once
the
story
gets
out
,
the
river
will
crawl
with
*NL*
expeditions
and
the
airships
rise
like
a
swarm
of
mosquitoes
.
''
I
laughed
*NL*
as
I
thought
of
it
.
``
We
've
made
a
great
mistake
not
to
let
Mr.
Yellow
*NL*
Press
in
on
this
.
Save
us
!
What
headlines
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
!
''
said
Terry
grimly
.
``
This
is
our
party
.
We
're
going
to
find
*NL*
that
place
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
when
you
do
find
it
--
if
you
do
?
''
Jeff
*NL*
asked
mildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
was
a
tender
soul
.
I
think
he
thought
that
country
--
if
there
was
*NL*
one
--
was
just
blossoming
with
roses
and
babies
and
canaries
and
tidies
,
*NL*
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Terry
,
in
his
secret
heart
,
had
visions
of
a
sort
of
sublimated
*NL*
summer
resort
--
just
Girls
and
Girls
and
Girls
--
and
that
he
was
going
to
*NL*
be
--
well
,
Terry
was
popular
among
women
even
when
there
were
other
men
*NL*
around
,
and
it
's
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
had
pleasant
dreams
of
*NL*
what
might
happen
.
I
could
see
it
in
his
eyes
as
he
lay
there
,
looking
*NL*
at
the
long
blue
rollers
slipping
by
,
and
fingering
that
impressive
*NL*
mustache
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
thought
--
then
--
that
I
could
form
a
far
clearer
idea
of
what
was
*NL*
before
us
than
either
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
all
off
,
boys
,
''
I
insisted
.
``
If
there
is
such
a
place
--
and
there
*NL*
does
seem
some
foundation
for
believing
it
--
you
'll
find
it
's
built
on
a
*NL*
sort
of
matriarchal
principle
,
that
's
all
.
The
men
have
a
separate
cult
*NL*
of
their
own
,
less
socially
developed
than
the
women
,
and
make
them
an
*NL*
annual
visit
--
a
sort
of
wedding
call
.
This
is
a
condition
known
to
have
*NL*
existed
--
here
's
just
a
survival
.
They
've
got
some
peculiarly
isolated
*NL*
valley
or
tableland
up
there
,
and
their
primeval
customs
have
survived
.
*NL*
That
's
all
there
is
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
the
boys
?
''
Jeff
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
men
take
them
away
as
soon
as
they
are
five
or
six
,
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
about
this
danger
theory
all
our
guides
were
so
sure
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Danger
enough
,
Terry
,
and
we
'll
have
to
be
mighty
careful
.
Women
of
*NL*
that
stage
of
culture
are
quite
able
to
defend
themselves
and
have
no
*NL*
welcome
for
unseasonable
visitors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
talked
and
talked
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
all
my
airs
of
sociological
superiority
I
was
no
nearer
than
*NL*
any
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
funny
though
,
in
the
light
of
what
we
did
find
,
those
extremely
*NL*
clear
ideas
of
ours
as
to
what
a
country
of
women
would
be
like
.
It
*NL*
was
no
use
to
tell
ourselves
and
one
another
that
all
this
was
idle
*NL*
speculation
.
We
were
idle
and
we
did
speculate
,
on
the
ocean
voyage
and
*NL*
the
river
voyage
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admitting
the
improbability
,
''
we
'd
begin
solemnly
,
and
then
launch
out
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
would
fight
among
themselves
,
''
Terry
insisted
.
``
Women
always
do
.
*NL*
We
must
n't
look
to
find
any
sort
of
order
and
organization
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
dead
wrong
,
''
Jeff
told
him
.
``
It
will
be
like
a
nunnery
under
an
*NL*
abbess
--
a
peaceful
,
harmonious
sisterhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
snorted
derision
at
this
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nuns
,
indeed
!
Your
peaceful
sisterhoods
were
all
celibate
,
Jeff
,
and
*NL*
under
vows
of
obedience
.
These
are
just
women
,
and
mothers
,
and
where
*NL*
there
's
motherhood
you
do
n't
find
sisterhood
--
not
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
--
they
'll
scrap
,
''
agreed
Terry
.
``
Also
we
must
n't
look
for
*NL*
inventions
and
progress
;
it
'll
be
awfully
primitive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
that
cloth
mill
?
''
Jeff
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
cloth
!
Women
have
always
been
spinsters
.
But
there
they
*NL*
stop
--
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
joked
Terry
about
his
modest
impression
that
he
would
be
warmly
*NL*
received
,
but
he
held
his
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
see
,
''
he
insisted
.
``
I
'll
get
solid
with
them
all
--
and
play
one
*NL*
bunch
against
another
.
I
'll
get
myself
elected
king
in
no
time
--
whew
!
*NL*
Solomon
will
have
to
take
a
back
seat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
we
come
in
on
that
deal
?
''
I
demanded
.
``
Are
n't
we
Viziers
or
*NL*
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
risk
it
,
''
he
asserted
solemnly
.
``
You
might
start
a
*NL*
revolution
--
probably
would
.
No
,
you
'll
have
to
be
beheaded
,
or
*NL*
bowstrung
--
or
whatever
the
popular
method
of
execution
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
have
to
do
it
yourself
,
remember
,
''
grinned
Jeff
.
``
No
husky
black
*NL*
slaves
and
mamelukes
!
And
there
'd
be
two
of
us
and
only
one
of
you
--
eh
,
*NL*
Van
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
's
ideas
and
Terry
's
were
so
far
apart
that
sometimes
it
was
all
*NL*
I
could
do
to
keep
the
peace
between
them
.
Jeff
idealized
women
in
the
*NL*
best
Southern
style
.
He
was
full
of
chivalry
and
sentiment
,
and
all
*NL*
that
.
And
he
was
a
good
boy
;
he
lived
up
to
his
ideals
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
might
say
Terry
did
,
too
,
if
you
can
call
his
views
about
women
*NL*
anything
so
polite
as
ideals
.
I
always
liked
Terry
.
He
was
a
man
's
man
,
*NL*
very
much
so
,
generous
and
brave
and
clever
;
but
I
do
n't
think
any
of
*NL*
us
in
college
days
was
quite
pleased
to
have
him
with
our
sisters
.
We
*NL*
were
n't
very
stringent
,
heavens
no
!
But
Terry
was
``
the
limit
.
''
Later
*NL*
on
--
why
,
of
course
a
man
's
life
is
his
own
,
we
held
,
and
asked
no
*NL*
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
barring
a
possible
exception
in
favor
of
a
not
impossible
wife
,
or
*NL*
of
his
mother
,
or
,
of
course
,
the
fair
relatives
of
his
friends
,
Terry
's
*NL*
idea
seemed
to
be
that
pretty
women
were
just
so
much
game
and
homely
*NL*
ones
not
worth
considering
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
really
unpleasant
sometimes
to
see
the
notions
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
got
out
of
patience
with
Jeff
,
too
.
He
had
such
rose-colored
halos
*NL*
on
his
womenfolks
.
I
held
a
middle
ground
,
highly
scientific
,
of
course
,
*NL*
and
used
to
argue
learnedly
about
the
physiological
limitations
of
the
*NL*
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
not
in
the
least
``
advanced
''
on
the
woman
question
,
any
of
us
,
*NL*
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
joked
and
disputed
and
speculated
,
and
after
an
interminable
*NL*
journey
,
we
got
to
our
old
camping
place
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
hard
to
find
the
river
,
just
poking
along
that
side
till
we
*NL*
came
to
it
,
and
it
was
navigable
as
far
as
the
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
reached
that
and
slid
out
on
its
broad
glistening
bosom
,
with
*NL*
that
high
gray
promontory
running
out
toward
us
,
and
the
straight
white
*NL*
fall
clearly
visible
,
it
began
to
be
really
exciting
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
talk
,
even
then
,
of
skirting
the
rock
wall
and
seeking
*NL*
a
possible
footway
up
,
but
the
marshy
jungle
made
that
method
look
not
*NL*
only
difficult
but
dangerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
dismissed
the
plan
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
fellows
!
We
've
decided
that
.
It
might
take
months
--
we
have
n't
*NL*
got
the
provisions
.
No
,
sir
--
we
've
got
to
take
our
chances
.
If
we
get
*NL*
back
safe
--
all
right
.
If
we
do
n't
,
why
,
we
're
not
the
first
explorers
to
*NL*
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
.
There
are
plenty
to
come
after
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
got
the
big
biplane
together
and
loaded
it
with
our
scientifically
*NL*
compressed
baggage
:
the
camera
,
of
course
;
the
glasses
;
a
supply
of
*NL*
concentrated
food
.
Our
pockets
were
magazines
of
small
necessities
,
and
*NL*
we
had
our
guns
,
of
course
--
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
and
up
and
up
we
sailed
,
way
up
at
first
,
to
get
``
the
lay
of
the
*NL*
land
''
and
make
note
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
that
dark
green
sea
of
crowding
forest
this
high-standing
spur
*NL*
rose
steeply
.
It
ran
back
on
either
side
,
apparently
,
to
the
far-off
*NL*
white-crowned
peaks
in
the
distance
,
themselves
probably
inaccessible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
make
the
first
trip
geographical
,
''
I
suggested
.
``
Spy
out
the
*NL*
land
,
and
drop
back
here
for
more
gasoline
.
With
your
tremendous
speed
*NL*
we
can
reach
that
range
and
back
all
right
.
Then
we
can
leave
a
sort
of
*NL*
map
on
board
--
for
that
relief
expedition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
sense
in
that
,
''
Terry
agreed
.
``
I
'll
put
off
being
king
of
*NL*
Ladyland
for
one
more
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
made
a
long
skirting
voyage
,
turned
the
point
of
the
cape
which
*NL*
was
close
by
,
ran
up
one
side
of
the
triangle
at
our
best
speed
,
crossed
*NL*
over
the
base
where
it
left
the
higher
mountains
,
and
so
back
to
our
*NL*
lake
by
moonlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
a
bad
little
kingdom
,
''
we
agreed
when
it
was
roughly
drawn
*NL*
and
measured
.
We
could
tell
the
size
fairly
by
our
speed
.
And
from
what
*NL*
we
could
see
of
the
sides
--
and
that
icy
ridge
at
the
back
end
--
``
It
's
a
*NL*
pretty
enterprising
savage
who
would
manage
to
get
into
it
,
''
Jeff
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
we
had
looked
at
the
land
itself
--
eagerly
,
but
we
were
too
*NL*
high
and
going
too
fast
to
see
much
.
It
appeared
to
be
well
forested
*NL*
about
the
edges
,
but
in
the
interior
there
were
wide
plains
,
and
*NL*
everywhere
parklike
meadows
and
open
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
cities
,
too
;
that
I
insisted
.
It
looked
--
well
,
it
looked
like
*NL*
any
other
country
--
a
civilized
one
,
I
mean
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
to
sleep
after
that
long
sweep
through
the
air
,
but
we
turned
out
*NL*
early
enough
next
day
,
and
again
we
rose
softly
up
the
height
till
*NL*
we
could
top
the
crowning
trees
and
see
the
broad
fair
land
at
our
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Semitropical
.
Looks
like
a
first-rate
climate
.
It
's
wonderful
what
a
*NL*
little
height
will
do
for
temperature
.
''
Terry
was
studying
the
forest
*NL*
growth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
height
!
Is
that
what
you
call
little
?
''
I
asked
.
Our
instruments
*NL*
measured
it
clearly
.
We
had
not
realized
the
long
gentle
rise
from
the
*NL*
coast
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mighty
lucky
piece
of
land
,
I
call
it
,
''
Terry
pursued
.
``
Now
for
the
*NL*
folks
--
I
've
had
enough
scenery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
sailed
low
,
crossing
back
and
forth
,
quartering
the
country
as
we
*NL*
went
,
and
studying
it
.
We
saw
--
I
ca
n't
remember
now
how
much
of
this
we
*NL*
noted
then
and
how
much
was
supplemented
by
our
later
knowledge
,
but
we
*NL*
could
not
help
seeing
this
much
,
even
on
that
excited
day
--
a
land
in
a
*NL*
state
of
perfect
cultivation
,
where
even
the
forests
looked
as
if
they
*NL*
were
cared
for
;
a
land
that
looked
like
an
enormous
park
,
only
it
was
*NL*
even
more
evidently
an
enormous
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
any
cattle
,
''
I
suggested
,
but
Terry
was
silent
.
We
were
*NL*
approaching
a
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
that
we
paid
small
attention
to
the
clean
,
well-built
roads
,
*NL*
to
the
attractive
architecture
,
to
the
ordered
beauty
of
the
little
*NL*
town
.
We
had
our
glasses
out
;
even
Terry
,
setting
his
machine
for
a
*NL*
spiral
glide
,
clapped
the
binoculars
to
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
our
whirring
screw
.
They
ran
out
of
the
houses
--
they
gathered
*NL*
in
from
the
fields
,
swift-running
light
figures
,
crowds
of
them
.
We
*NL*
stared
and
stared
until
it
was
almost
too
late
to
catch
the
levers
,
*NL*
sweep
off
and
rise
again
;
and
then
we
held
our
peace
for
a
long
run
*NL*
upward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh
!
''
said
Terry
,
after
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
women
there
--
and
children
,
''
Jeff
urged
excitedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
look
--
why
,
this
is
a
CIVILIZED
country
!
''
I
protested
.
``
There
*NL*
must
be
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
there
are
men
,
''
said
Terry
.
``
Come
on
,
let
's
find
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
refused
to
listen
to
Jeff
's
suggestion
that
we
examine
the
country
*NL*
further
before
we
risked
leaving
our
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
fine
landing
place
right
there
where
we
came
over
,
''
he
*NL*
insisted
,
and
it
was
an
excellent
one
--
a
wide
,
flat-topped
rock
,
*NL*
overlooking
the
lake
,
and
quite
out
of
sight
from
the
interior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
find
this
in
a
hurry
,
''
he
asserted
,
as
we
scrambled
with
the
*NL*
utmost
difficulty
down
to
safer
footing
.
``
Come
on
,
boys
--
there
were
some
*NL*
good
lookers
in
that
bunch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
it
was
unwise
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
easy
to
see
afterward
that
our
best
plan
was
to
have
*NL*
studied
the
country
more
fully
before
we
left
our
swooping
airship
and
*NL*
trusted
ourselves
to
mere
foot
service
.
But
we
were
three
young
men
.
We
*NL*
had
been
talking
about
this
country
for
over
a
year
,
hardly
believing
*NL*
that
there
was
such
a
place
,
and
now
--
we
were
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
looked
safe
and
civilized
enough
,
and
among
those
upturned
,
crowding
*NL*
faces
,
though
some
were
terrified
enough
,
there
was
great
beauty
--
on
*NL*
that
we
all
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
!
''
cried
Terry
,
pushing
forward
.
``
Oh
,
come
on
!
Here
goes
for
*NL*
Herland
!
''

CHAPTER
2
.
Rash
Advances
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Not
more
than
ten
or
fifteen
miles
we
judged
it
from
our
landing
rock
to
*NL*
that
last
village
.
For
all
our
eagerness
we
thought
it
wise
to
keep
to
*NL*
the
woods
and
go
carefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Terry
's
ardor
was
held
in
check
by
his
firm
conviction
that
there
*NL*
were
men
to
be
met
,
and
we
saw
to
it
that
each
of
us
had
a
good
stock
of
*NL*
cartridges
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
may
be
scarce
,
and
they
may
be
hidden
away
somewhere
--
some
kind
of
*NL*
a
matriarchate
,
as
Jeff
tells
us
;
for
that
matter
,
they
may
live
up
*NL*
in
the
mountains
yonder
and
keep
the
women
in
this
part
of
the
*NL*
country
--
sort
of
a
national
harem
!
But
there
are
men
somewhere
--
did
n't
*NL*
you
see
the
babies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
all
seen
babies
,
children
big
and
little
,
everywhere
that
we
had
*NL*
come
near
enough
to
distinguish
the
people
.
And
though
by
dress
we
could
*NL*
not
be
sure
of
all
the
grown
persons
,
still
there
had
not
been
one
man
*NL*
that
we
were
certain
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
liked
that
Arab
saying
,
`
First
tie
your
camel
and
then
trust
*NL*
in
the
Lord
,
'
''
Jeff
murmured
;
so
we
all
had
our
weapons
in
hand
,
and
*NL*
stole
cautiously
through
the
forest
.
Terry
studied
it
as
we
progressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
of
civilization
,
''
he
cried
softly
in
restrained
enthusiasm
.
``
I
*NL*
never
saw
a
forest
so
petted
,
even
in
Germany
.
Look
,
there
's
not
a
dead
*NL*
bough
--
the
vines
are
trained
--
actually
!
And
see
here
''
--
he
stopped
and
*NL*
looked
about
him
,
calling
Jeff
's
attention
to
the
kinds
of
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
me
for
a
landmark
and
made
a
limited
excursion
on
either
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Food-bearing
,
practically
all
of
them
,
''
they
announced
returning
.
``
The
*NL*
rest
,
splendid
hardwood
.
Call
this
a
forest
?
It
's
a
truck
farm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
thing
to
have
a
botanist
on
hand
,
''
I
agreed
.
``
Sure
there
are
no
*NL*
medicinal
ones
?
Or
any
for
pure
ornament
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
quite
right
.
These
towering
trees
were
*NL*
under
as
careful
cultivation
as
so
many
cabbages
.
In
other
conditions
*NL*
we
should
have
found
those
woods
full
of
fair
foresters
and
fruit
*NL*
gatherers
;
but
an
airship
is
a
conspicuous
object
,
and
by
no
means
*NL*
quiet
--
and
women
are
cautious
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
we
found
moving
in
those
woods
,
as
we
started
through
them
,
were
*NL*
birds
,
some
gorgeous
,
some
musical
,
all
so
tame
that
it
seemed
almost
*NL*
to
contradict
our
theory
of
cultivation
--
at
least
until
we
came
upon
*NL*
occasional
little
glades
,
where
carved
stone
seats
and
tables
stood
in
*NL*
the
shade
beside
clear
fountains
,
with
shallow
bird
baths
always
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
kill
birds
,
and
apparently
they
do
kill
cats
,
''
Terry
*NL*
declared
.
``
MUST
be
men
here
.
Hark
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
heard
something
:
something
not
in
the
least
like
a
birdsong
,
and
*NL*
very
much
like
a
suppressed
whisper
of
laughter
--
a
little
happy
sound
,
*NL*
instantly
smothered
.
We
stood
like
so
many
pointers
,
and
then
used
our
*NL*
glasses
,
swiftly
,
carefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
could
n't
have
been
far
off
,
''
said
Terry
excitedly
.
``
How
about
this
*NL*
big
tree
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
very
large
and
beautiful
tree
in
the
glade
we
had
just
*NL*
entered
,
with
thick
wide-spreading
branches
that
sloped
out
in
lapping
*NL*
fans
like
a
beech
or
pine
.
It
was
trimmed
underneath
some
twenty
feet
*NL*
up
,
and
stood
there
like
a
huge
umbrella
,
with
circling
seats
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
''
he
pursued
.
``
There
are
short
stumps
of
branches
left
to
climb
*NL*
on
.
There
's
someone
up
that
tree
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
stole
near
,
cautiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
for
a
poisoned
arrow
in
your
eye
,
''
I
suggested
,
but
Terry
*NL*
pressed
forward
,
sprang
up
on
the
seat-back
,
and
grasped
the
trunk
.
``
In
*NL*
my
heart
,
more
likely
,
''
he
answered
.
``
Gee
!
Look
,
boys
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
rushed
close
in
and
looked
up
.
There
among
the
boughs
overhead
was
*NL*
something
--
more
than
one
something
--
that
clung
motionless
,
close
to
the
*NL*
great
trunk
at
first
,
and
then
,
as
one
and
all
we
started
up
the
tree
,
*NL*
separated
into
three
swift-moving
figures
and
fled
upward
.
As
we
climbed
*NL*
we
could
catch
glimpses
of
them
scattering
above
us
.
By
the
time
we
had
*NL*
reached
about
as
far
as
three
men
together
dared
push
,
they
had
left
the
*NL*
main
trunk
and
moved
outward
,
each
one
balanced
on
a
long
branch
that
*NL*
dipped
and
swayed
beneath
the
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
paused
uncertain
.
If
we
pursued
further
,
the
boughs
would
break
under
*NL*
the
double
burden
.
We
might
shake
them
off
,
perhaps
,
but
none
of
us
was
*NL*
so
inclined
.
In
the
soft
dappled
light
of
these
high
regions
,
breathless
*NL*
with
our
rapid
climb
,
we
rested
awhile
,
eagerly
studying
our
objects
*NL*
of
pursuit
;
while
they
in
turn
,
with
no
more
terror
than
a
set
of
*NL*
frolicsome
children
in
a
game
of
tag
,
sat
as
lightly
as
so
many
big
*NL*
bright
birds
on
their
precarious
perches
and
frankly
,
curiously
,
stared
*NL*
at
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Girls
!
''
whispered
Jeff
,
under
his
breath
,
as
if
they
might
fly
if
he
*NL*
spoke
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peaches
!
''
added
Terry
,
scarcely
louder
.
*NL*
``
Peacherinos
--
apricot-nectarines
!
Whew
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
girls
,
of
course
,
no
boys
could
ever
have
shown
that
sparkling
*NL*
beauty
,
and
yet
none
of
us
was
certain
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
saw
short
hair
,
hatless
,
loose
,
and
shining
;
a
suit
of
some
light
*NL*
firm
stuff
,
the
closest
of
tunics
and
kneebreeches
,
met
by
trim
gaiters
.
*NL*
As
bright
and
smooth
as
parrots
and
as
unaware
of
danger
,
they
swung
*NL*
there
before
us
,
wholly
at
ease
,
staring
as
we
stared
,
till
first
one
,
*NL*
and
then
all
of
them
burst
into
peals
of
delighted
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
a
torrent
of
soft
talk
tossed
back
and
forth
;
no
savage
*NL*
sing-song
,
but
clear
musical
fluent
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
met
their
laughter
cordially
,
and
doffed
our
hats
to
them
,
at
which
*NL*
they
laughed
again
,
delightedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Terry
,
wholly
in
his
element
,
made
a
polite
speech
,
with
*NL*
explanatory
gestures
,
and
proceeded
to
introduce
us
,
with
pointing
*NL*
finger
.
``
Mr.
Jeff
Margrave
,
''
he
said
clearly
;
Jeff
bowed
as
gracefully
*NL*
as
a
man
could
in
the
fork
of
a
great
limb
.
``
Mr.
Vandyck
Jennings
''
--
I
*NL*
also
tried
to
make
an
effective
salute
and
nearly
lost
my
balance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Terry
laid
his
hand
upon
his
chest
--
a
fine
chest
he
had
,
too
,
*NL*
and
introduced
himself
;
he
was
braced
carefully
for
the
occasion
and
*NL*
achieved
an
excellent
obeisance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
they
laughed
delightedly
,
and
the
one
nearest
me
followed
his
*NL*
tactics
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Celis
,
''
she
said
distinctly
,
pointing
to
the
one
in
blue
;
``
Alima
''
--
the
*NL*
one
in
rose
;
then
,
with
a
vivid
imitation
of
Terry
's
impressive
manner
,
*NL*
she
laid
a
firm
delicate
hand
on
her
gold-green
jerkin
--
``
Ellador
.
''
This
*NL*
was
pleasant
,
but
we
got
no
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't
sit
here
and
learn
the
language
,
''
Terry
protested
.
He
beckoned
*NL*
to
them
to
come
nearer
,
most
winningly
--
but
they
gaily
shook
their
*NL*
heads
.
He
suggested
,
by
signs
,
that
we
all
go
down
together
;
but
again
*NL*
they
shook
their
heads
,
still
merrily
.
Then
Ellador
clearly
indicated
*NL*
that
we
should
go
down
,
pointing
to
each
and
all
of
us
,
with
*NL*
unmistakable
firmness
;
and
further
seeming
to
imply
by
the
sweep
of
a
*NL*
lithe
arm
that
we
not
only
go
downward
,
but
go
away
altogether
--
at
which
*NL*
we
shook
our
heads
in
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
to
use
bait
,
''
grinned
Terry
.
``
I
do
n't
know
about
you
fellows
,
*NL*
but
I
came
prepared
.
''
He
produced
from
an
inner
pocket
a
little
box
of
*NL*
purple
velvet
,
that
opened
with
a
snap
--
and
out
of
it
he
drew
a
long
*NL*
sparkling
thing
,
a
necklace
of
big
varicolored
stones
that
would
have
*NL*
been
worth
a
million
if
real
ones
.
He
held
it
up
,
swung
it
,
glittering
*NL*
in
the
sun
,
offered
it
first
to
one
,
then
to
another
,
holding
it
out
as
*NL*
far
as
he
could
reach
toward
the
girl
nearest
him
.
He
stood
braced
*NL*
in
the
fork
,
held
firmly
by
one
hand
--
the
other
,
swinging
his
bright
*NL*
temptation
,
reached
far
out
along
the
bough
,
but
not
quite
to
his
full
*NL*
stretch
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
visibly
moved
,
I
noted
,
hesitated
,
spoke
to
her
companions
.
*NL*
They
chattered
softly
together
,
one
evidently
warning
her
,
the
other
*NL*
encouraging
.
Then
,
softly
and
slowly
,
she
drew
nearer
.
This
was
Alima
,
*NL*
a
tall
long-limbed
lass
,
well-knit
and
evidently
both
strong
and
agile
.
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
splendid
,
wide
,
fearless
,
as
free
from
suspicion
as
a
*NL*
child
's
who
has
never
been
rebuked
.
Her
interest
was
more
that
of
*NL*
an
intent
boy
playing
a
fascinating
game
than
of
a
girl
lured
by
an
*NL*
ornament
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
moved
a
bit
farther
out
,
holding
firmly
,
watching
.
Terry
's
*NL*
smile
was
irreproachable
,
but
I
did
not
like
the
look
in
his
eyes
--
it
*NL*
was
like
a
creature
about
to
spring
.
I
could
already
see
it
happen
--
the
*NL*
dropped
necklace
,
the
sudden
clutching
hand
,
the
girl
's
sharp
cry
as
he
*NL*
seized
her
and
drew
her
in
.
But
it
did
n't
happen
.
She
made
a
timid
reach
*NL*
with
her
right
hand
for
the
gay
swinging
thing
--
he
held
it
a
little
*NL*
nearer
--
then
,
swift
as
light
,
she
seized
it
from
him
with
her
left
,
and
*NL*
dropped
on
the
instant
to
the
bough
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
his
snatch
,
quite
vainly
,
almost
losing
his
position
as
his
*NL*
hand
clutched
only
air
;
and
then
,
with
inconceivable
rapidity
,
the
three
*NL*
bright
creatures
were
gone
.
They
dropped
from
the
ends
of
the
big
boughs
*NL*
to
those
below
,
fairly
pouring
themselves
off
the
tree
,
while
we
climbed
*NL*
downward
as
swiftly
as
we
could
.
We
heard
their
vanishing
gay
laughter
,
*NL*
we
saw
them
fleeting
away
in
the
wide
open
reaches
of
the
forest
,
and
*NL*
gave
chase
,
but
we
might
as
well
have
chased
wild
antelopes
;
so
we
*NL*
stopped
at
length
somewhat
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
use
,
''
gasped
Terry
.
``
They
got
away
with
it
.
My
word
!
The
men
of
this
*NL*
country
must
be
good
sprinters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inhabitants
evidently
arboreal
,
''
I
grimly
suggested
.
``
Civilized
and
*NL*
still
arboreal
--
peculiar
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
have
tried
that
way
,
''
Jeff
protested
.
``
They
were
*NL*
perfectly
friendly
;
now
we
've
scared
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
no
use
grumbling
,
and
Terry
refused
to
admit
any
mistake
.
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
expected
it
.
Women
like
to
be
run
after
.
Come
*NL*
on
,
let
's
get
to
that
town
;
maybe
we
'll
find
them
there
.
Let
's
see
,
it
*NL*
was
in
this
direction
and
not
far
from
the
woods
,
as
I
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
open
country
we
reconnoitered
with
our
*NL*
field
glasses
.
There
it
was
,
about
four
miles
off
,
the
same
town
,
we
*NL*
concluded
,
unless
,
as
Jeff
ventured
,
they
all
had
pink
houses
.
The
broad
*NL*
green
fields
and
closely
cultivated
gardens
sloped
away
at
our
feet
,
a
*NL*
long
easy
slant
,
with
good
roads
winding
pleasantly
here
and
there
,
and
*NL*
narrower
paths
besides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
!
''
cried
Jeff
suddenly
.
``
There
they
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
,
close
to
the
town
,
across
a
wide
meadow
,
three
bright-hued
*NL*
figures
were
running
swiftly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
they
have
got
that
far
in
this
time
?
It
ca
n't
be
the
same
*NL*
ones
,
''
I
urged
.
But
through
the
glasses
we
could
identify
our
pretty
*NL*
tree-climbers
quite
plainly
,
at
least
by
costume
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
watched
them
,
we
all
did
for
that
matter
,
till
they
disappeared
*NL*
among
the
houses
.
Then
he
put
down
his
glass
and
turned
to
us
,
drawing
*NL*
a
long
breath
.
``
Mother
of
Mike
,
boys
--
what
Gorgeous
Girls
!
To
climb
like
*NL*
that
!
to
run
like
that
!
and
afraid
of
nothing
.
This
country
suits
me
all
*NL*
right
.
Let
's
get
ahead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
venture
,
nothing
have
,
''
I
suggested
,
but
Terry
preferred
``
Faint
*NL*
heart
ne'er
won
fair
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
set
forth
in
the
open
,
walking
briskly
.
``
If
there
are
any
men
,
we
'd
*NL*
better
keep
an
eye
out
,
''
I
suggested
,
but
Jeff
seemed
lost
in
heavenly
*NL*
dreams
,
and
Terry
in
highly
practical
plans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
perfect
road
!
What
a
heavenly
country
!
See
the
flowers
,
will
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Jeff
,
always
an
enthusiast
;
but
we
could
agree
with
him
fully
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
road
was
some
sort
of
hard
manufactured
stuff
,
sloped
slightly
to
*NL*
shed
rain
,
with
every
curve
and
grade
and
gutter
as
perfect
as
if
it
*NL*
were
Europe
's
best
.
``
No
men
,
eh
?
''
sneered
Terry
.
On
either
side
a
double
*NL*
row
of
trees
shaded
the
footpaths
;
between
the
trees
bushes
or
vines
,
*NL*
all
fruit-bearing
,
now
and
then
seats
and
little
wayside
fountains
;
*NL*
everywhere
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'd
better
import
some
of
these
ladies
and
set
'em
to
parking
the
*NL*
United
States
,
''
I
suggested
.
``
Mighty
nice
place
they
've
got
here
.
''
We
*NL*
rested
a
few
moments
by
one
of
the
fountains
,
tested
the
fruit
that
*NL*
looked
ripe
,
and
went
on
,
impressed
,
for
all
our
gay
bravado
by
the
*NL*
sense
of
quiet
potency
which
lay
about
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
evidently
a
people
highly
skilled
,
efficient
,
caring
for
their
*NL*
country
as
a
florist
cares
for
his
costliest
orchids
.
Under
the
soft
*NL*
brilliant
blue
of
that
clear
sky
,
in
the
pleasant
shade
of
those
endless
*NL*
rows
of
trees
,
we
walked
unharmed
,
the
placid
silence
broken
only
by
the
*NL*
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
there
lay
before
us
at
the
foot
of
a
long
hill
the
town
or
*NL*
village
we
were
aiming
for
.
We
stopped
and
studied
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
drew
a
long
breath
.
``
I
would
n't
have
believed
a
collection
of
*NL*
houses
could
look
so
lovely
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
architects
and
landscape
gardeners
in
plenty
,
that
's
sure
,
''
*NL*
agreed
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
astonished
myself
.
You
see
,
I
come
from
California
,
and
there
's
no
*NL*
country
lovelier
,
but
when
it
comes
to
towns
--
!
I
have
often
groaned
*NL*
at
home
to
see
the
offensive
mess
man
made
in
the
face
of
nature
,
even
*NL*
though
I
'm
no
art
sharp
,
like
Jeff
.
But
this
place
!
It
was
built
mostly
*NL*
of
a
sort
of
dull
rose-colored
stone
,
with
here
and
there
some
clear
*NL*
white
houses
;
and
it
lay
abroad
among
the
green
groves
and
gardens
like
*NL*
a
broken
rosary
of
pink
coral
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
big
white
ones
are
public
buildings
evidently
,
''
Terry
declared
.
*NL*
``
This
is
no
savage
country
,
my
friend
.
But
no
men
?
Boys
,
it
behooves
us
*NL*
to
go
forward
most
politely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
had
an
odd
look
,
more
impressive
as
we
approached
.
``
It
's
like
*NL*
an
exposition
.
''
``
It
's
too
pretty
to
be
true
.
''
``
Plenty
of
palaces
,
but
*NL*
where
are
the
homes
?
''
``
Oh
there
are
little
ones
enough
--
but
--
.
''
It
*NL*
certainly
was
different
from
any
towns
we
had
ever
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
dirt
,
''
said
Jeff
suddenly
.
``
There
's
no
smoke
,
''
he
added
*NL*
after
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
noise
,
''
I
offered
;
but
Terry
snubbed
me
--
``
That
's
because
*NL*
they
are
laying
low
for
us
;
we
'd
better
be
careful
how
we
go
in
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
induce
him
to
stay
out
,
however
,
so
we
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
beauty
,
order
,
perfect
cleanness
,
and
the
pleasantest
*NL*
sense
of
home
over
it
all
.
As
we
neared
the
center
of
the
town
the
*NL*
houses
stood
thicker
,
ran
together
as
it
were
,
grew
into
rambling
*NL*
palaces
grouped
among
parks
and
open
squares
,
something
as
college
*NL*
buildings
stand
in
their
quiet
greens
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
turning
a
corner
,
we
came
into
a
broad
paved
space
and
*NL*
saw
before
us
a
band
of
women
standing
close
together
in
even
order
,
*NL*
evidently
waiting
for
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stopped
a
moment
and
looked
back
.
The
street
behind
was
closed
by
*NL*
another
band
,
marching
steadily
,
shoulder
to
shoulder
.
We
went
*NL*
on
--
there
seemed
no
other
way
to
go
--
and
presently
found
ourselves
quite
*NL*
surrounded
by
this
close-massed
multitude
,
women
,
all
of
them
,
but
--
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
young
.
They
were
not
old
.
They
were
not
,
in
the
girl
*NL*
sense
,
beautiful
.
They
were
not
in
the
least
ferocious
.
And
yet
,
as
I
*NL*
looked
from
face
to
face
,
calm
,
grave
,
wise
,
wholly
unafraid
,
evidently
*NL*
assured
and
determined
,
I
had
the
funniest
feeling
--
a
very
early
*NL*
feeling
--
a
feeling
that
I
traced
back
and
back
in
memory
until
I
caught
*NL*
up
with
it
at
last
.
It
was
that
sense
of
being
hopelessly
in
the
wrong
*NL*
that
I
had
so
often
felt
in
early
youth
when
my
short
legs
'
utmost
*NL*
effort
failed
to
overcome
the
fact
that
I
was
late
to
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
felt
it
too
;
I
could
see
he
did
.
We
felt
like
small
boys
,
very
*NL*
small
boys
,
caught
doing
mischief
in
some
gracious
lady
's
house
.
But
*NL*
Terry
showed
no
such
consciousness
.
I
saw
his
quick
eyes
darting
here
*NL*
and
there
,
estimating
numbers
,
measuring
distances
,
judging
chances
of
*NL*
escape
.
He
examined
the
close
ranks
about
us
,
reaching
back
far
on
every
*NL*
side
,
and
murmured
softly
to
me
,
``
Every
one
of
'em
over
forty
as
I
'm
a
*NL*
sinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
they
were
not
old
women
.
Each
was
in
the
full
bloom
of
rosy
health
,
*NL*
erect
,
serene
,
standing
sure-footed
and
light
as
any
pugilist
.
They
had
*NL*
no
weapons
,
and
we
had
,
but
we
had
no
wish
to
shoot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
as
soon
shoot
my
aunts
,
''
muttered
Terry
again
.
``
What
do
they
*NL*
want
with
us
anyhow
?
They
seem
to
mean
business
.
''
But
in
spite
of
that
*NL*
businesslike
aspect
,
he
determined
to
try
his
favorite
tactics
.
Terry
*NL*
had
come
armed
with
a
theory
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
forward
,
with
his
brilliant
ingratiating
smile
,
and
made
low
*NL*
obeisance
to
the
women
before
him
.
Then
he
produced
another
tribute
,
a
*NL*
broad
soft
scarf
of
filmy
texture
,
rich
in
color
and
pattern
,
a
lovely
*NL*
thing
,
even
to
my
eye
,
and
offered
it
with
a
deep
bow
to
the
tall
*NL*
unsmiling
woman
who
seemed
to
head
the
ranks
before
him
.
She
took
it
*NL*
with
a
gracious
nod
of
acknowledgment
,
and
passed
it
on
to
those
behind
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
again
,
this
time
bringing
out
a
circlet
of
rhinestones
,
a
*NL*
glittering
crown
that
should
have
pleased
any
woman
on
earth
.
He
made
a
*NL*
brief
address
,
including
Jeff
and
me
as
partners
in
his
enterprise
,
and
*NL*
with
another
bow
presented
this
.
Again
his
gift
was
accepted
and
,
as
*NL*
before
,
passed
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
were
only
younger
,
''
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
.
``
What
on
*NL*
earth
is
a
fellow
to
say
to
a
regiment
of
old
Colonels
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
our
discussions
and
speculations
we
had
always
unconsciously
*NL*
assumed
that
the
women
,
whatever
else
they
might
be
,
would
be
young
.
*NL*
Most
men
do
think
that
way
,
I
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
''
in
the
abstract
is
young
,
and
,
we
assume
,
charming
.
As
they
get
*NL*
older
they
pass
off
the
stage
,
somehow
,
into
private
ownership
mostly
,
*NL*
or
out
of
it
altogether
.
But
these
good
ladies
were
very
much
on
the
*NL*
stage
,
and
yet
any
one
of
them
might
have
been
a
grandmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
for
nervousness
--
there
was
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
terror
,
perhaps
--
there
was
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
uneasiness
,
for
curiosity
,
for
excitement
--
and
all
we
saw
was
what
*NL*
might
have
been
a
vigilance
committee
of
women
doctors
,
as
cool
as
*NL*
cucumbers
,
and
evidently
meaning
to
take
us
to
task
for
being
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
of
them
stepped
forward
now
,
one
on
either
side
of
each
of
us
,
and
*NL*
indicated
that
we
were
to
go
with
them
.
We
thought
it
best
to
accede
,
at
*NL*
first
anyway
,
and
marched
along
,
one
of
these
close
at
each
elbow
,
and
*NL*
the
others
in
close
masses
before
,
behind
,
on
both
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
large
building
opened
before
us
,
a
very
heavy
thick-walled
impressive
*NL*
place
,
big
,
and
old-looking
;
of
gray
stone
,
not
like
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
wo
n't
do
!
''
said
Terry
to
us
,
quickly
.
``
We
must
n't
let
them
get
us
*NL*
in
this
,
boys
.
All
together
,
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
stopped
in
our
tracks
.
We
began
to
explain
,
to
make
signs
pointing
*NL*
away
toward
the
big
forest
--
indicating
that
we
would
go
back
to
it
--
at
*NL*
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
makes
me
laugh
,
knowing
all
I
do
now
,
to
think
of
us
three
*NL*
boys
--
nothing
else
;
three
audacious
impertinent
boys
--
butting
into
an
*NL*
unknown
country
without
any
sort
of
a
guard
or
defense
.
We
seemed
to
*NL*
think
that
if
there
were
men
we
could
fight
them
,
and
if
there
were
only
*NL*
women
--
why
,
they
would
be
no
obstacles
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
,
with
his
gentle
romantic
old-fashioned
notions
of
women
as
*NL*
clinging
vines
.
Terry
,
with
his
clear
decided
practical
theories
that
*NL*
there
were
two
kinds
of
women
--
those
he
wanted
and
those
he
did
n't
;
*NL*
Desirable
and
Undesirable
was
his
demarcation
.
The
latter
as
a
large
*NL*
class
,
but
negligible
--
he
had
never
thought
about
them
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
here
they
were
,
in
great
numbers
,
evidently
indifferent
to
*NL*
what
he
might
think
,
evidently
determined
on
some
purpose
of
their
own
*NL*
regarding
him
,
and
apparently
well
able
to
enforce
their
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
thought
hard
just
then
.
It
had
not
seemed
wise
to
object
to
going
*NL*
with
them
,
even
if
we
could
have
;
our
one
chance
was
friendliness
--
a
*NL*
civilized
attitude
on
both
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
once
inside
that
building
,
there
was
no
knowing
what
these
*NL*
determined
ladies
might
do
to
us
.
Even
a
peaceful
detention
was
not
to
*NL*
our
minds
,
and
when
we
named
it
imprisonment
it
looked
even
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
made
a
stand
,
trying
to
make
clear
that
we
preferred
the
open
*NL*
country
.
One
of
them
came
forward
with
a
sketch
of
our
flier
,
asking
by
*NL*
signs
if
we
were
the
aerial
visitors
they
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
we
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
pointed
to
it
again
,
and
to
the
outlying
country
,
in
different
*NL*
directions
--
but
we
pretended
we
did
not
know
where
it
was
,
and
in
*NL*
truth
we
were
not
quite
sure
and
gave
a
rather
wild
indication
of
its
*NL*
whereabouts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
they
motioned
us
to
advance
,
standing
so
packed
about
the
door
*NL*
that
there
remained
but
the
one
straight
path
open
.
All
around
us
and
*NL*
behind
they
were
massed
solidly
--
there
was
simply
nothing
to
do
but
go
*NL*
forward
--
or
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
held
a
consultation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
fought
with
women
in
my
life
,
''
said
Terry
,
greatly
perturbed
,
*NL*
``
but
I
'm
not
going
in
there
.
I
'm
not
going
to
be
--
herded
in
--
as
if
we
*NL*
were
in
a
cattle
chute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't
fight
them
,
of
course
,
''
Jeff
urged
.
``
They
're
all
women
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
their
nondescript
clothes
;
nice
women
,
too
;
good
strong
*NL*
sensible
faces
.
I
guess
we
'll
have
to
go
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
may
never
get
out
,
if
we
do
,
''
I
told
them
.
``
Strong
and
sensible
,
*NL*
yes
;
but
I
'm
not
so
sure
about
the
good
.
Look
at
those
faces
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
stood
at
ease
,
waiting
while
we
conferred
together
,
but
never
*NL*
relaxing
their
close
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
attitude
was
not
the
rigid
discipline
of
soldiers
;
there
was
no
*NL*
sense
of
compulsion
about
them
.
Terry
's
term
of
a
``
vigilance
committee
''
*NL*
was
highly
descriptive
.
They
had
just
the
aspect
of
sturdy
burghers
,
*NL*
gathered
hastily
to
meet
some
common
need
or
peril
,
all
moved
by
*NL*
precisely
the
same
feelings
,
to
the
same
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
,
anywhere
before
,
had
I
seen
women
of
precisely
this
quality
.
*NL*
Fishwives
and
market
women
might
show
similar
strength
,
but
it
was
*NL*
coarse
and
heavy
.
These
were
merely
athletic
--
light
and
powerful
.
*NL*
College
professors
,
teachers
,
writers
--
many
women
showed
similar
*NL*
intelligence
but
often
wore
a
strained
nervous
look
,
while
these
were
as
*NL*
calm
as
cows
,
for
all
their
evident
intellect
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
observed
pretty
closely
just
then
,
for
all
of
us
felt
that
it
was
a
*NL*
crucial
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
leader
gave
some
word
of
command
and
beckoned
us
on
,
and
the
*NL*
surrounding
mass
moved
a
step
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
got
to
decide
quick
,
''
said
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
vote
to
go
in
,
''
Jeff
urged
.
But
we
were
two
to
one
against
him
and
he
*NL*
loyally
stood
by
us
.
We
made
one
more
effort
to
be
let
go
,
urgent
,
but
*NL*
not
imploring
.
In
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
for
a
rush
,
boys
!
''
Terry
said
.
``
And
if
we
ca
n't
break
'em
,
I
'll
*NL*
shoot
in
the
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
found
ourselves
much
in
the
position
of
the
suffragette
trying
*NL*
to
get
to
the
Parliament
buildings
through
a
triple
cordon
of
London
*NL*
police
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
solidity
of
those
women
was
something
amazing
.
Terry
soon
found
that
*NL*
it
was
useless
,
tore
himself
loose
for
a
moment
,
pulled
his
revolver
,
*NL*
and
fired
upward
.
As
they
caught
at
it
,
he
fired
again
--
we
heard
a
*NL*
cry
--
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
each
of
us
was
seized
by
five
women
,
each
holding
arm
or
leg
*NL*
or
head
;
we
were
lifted
like
children
,
straddling
helpless
children
,
and
*NL*
borne
onward
,
wriggling
indeed
,
but
most
ineffectually
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
borne
inside
,
struggling
manfully
,
but
held
secure
most
*NL*
womanfully
,
in
spite
of
our
best
endeavors
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
carried
and
so
held
,
we
came
into
a
high
inner
hall
,
gray
and
bare
,
*NL*
and
were
brought
before
a
majestic
gray-haired
woman
who
seemed
to
hold
*NL*
a
judicial
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
talk
,
not
much
,
among
them
,
and
then
suddenly
there
fell
*NL*
upon
each
of
us
at
once
a
firm
hand
holding
a
wetted
cloth
before
mouth
*NL*
and
nose
--
an
order
of
swimming
sweetness
--
anesthesia
.

CHAPTER
3
.
A
Peculiar
Imprisonment
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
slumber
as
deep
as
death
,
as
refreshing
as
that
of
a
healthy
*NL*
child
,
I
slowly
awakened
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
rising
up
,
up
,
up
through
a
deep
warm
ocean
,
nearer
*NL*
and
nearer
to
full
light
and
stirring
air
.
Or
like
the
return
to
*NL*
consciousness
after
concussion
of
the
brain
.
I
was
once
thrown
from
a
*NL*
horse
while
on
a
visit
to
a
wild
mountainous
country
quite
new
to
me
,
*NL*
and
I
can
clearly
remember
the
mental
experience
of
coming
back
to
life
,
*NL*
through
lifting
veils
of
dream
.
When
I
first
dimly
heard
the
voices
of
*NL*
those
about
me
,
and
saw
the
shining
snowpeaks
of
that
mighty
range
,
I
*NL*
assumed
that
this
too
would
pass
,
and
I
should
presently
find
myself
in
*NL*
my
own
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
precisely
the
experience
of
this
awakening
:
receding
waves
of
*NL*
half-caught
swirling
vision
,
memories
of
home
,
the
steamer
,
the
boat
,
*NL*
the
airship
,
the
forest
--
at
last
all
sinking
away
one
after
another
,
*NL*
till
my
eyes
were
wide
open
,
my
brain
clear
,
and
I
realized
what
had
*NL*
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
prominent
sensation
was
of
absolute
physical
comfort
.
I
was
*NL*
lying
in
a
perfect
bed
:
long
,
broad
,
smooth
;
firmly
soft
and
level
;
with
*NL*
the
finest
linen
,
some
warm
light
quilt
of
blanket
,
and
a
counterpane
*NL*
that
was
a
joy
to
the
eye
.
The
sheet
turned
down
some
fifteen
inches
,
*NL*
yet
I
could
stretch
my
feet
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
free
but
warmly
*NL*
covered
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
as
light
and
clean
as
a
white
feather
.
It
took
me
some
time
to
*NL*
conscientiously
locate
my
arms
and
legs
,
to
feel
the
vivid
sense
of
life
*NL*
radiate
from
the
wakening
center
to
the
extremities
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
big
room
,
high
and
wide
,
with
many
lofty
windows
whose
closed
blinds
*NL*
let
through
soft
green-lit
air
;
a
beautiful
room
,
in
proportion
,
in
*NL*
color
,
in
smooth
simplicity
;
a
scent
of
blossoming
gardens
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
perfectly
still
,
quite
happy
,
quite
conscious
,
and
yet
not
*NL*
actively
realizing
what
had
happened
till
I
heard
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh
!
''
was
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
my
head
.
There
were
three
beds
in
this
chamber
,
and
plenty
of
*NL*
room
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
sitting
up
,
looking
about
him
,
alert
as
ever
.
His
remark
,
*NL*
though
not
loud
,
roused
Jeff
also
.
We
all
sat
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
swung
his
legs
out
of
bed
,
stood
up
,
stretched
himself
mightily
.
*NL*
He
was
in
a
long
nightrobe
,
a
sort
of
seamless
garment
,
undoubtedly
*NL*
comfortable
--
we
all
found
ourselves
so
covered
.
Shoes
were
beside
each
*NL*
bed
,
also
quite
comfortable
and
goodlooking
though
by
no
means
like
our
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
for
our
clothes
--
they
were
not
there
,
nor
anything
of
all
the
*NL*
varied
contents
of
our
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
door
stood
somewhat
ajar
;
it
opened
into
a
most
attractive
bathroom
,
*NL*
copiously
provided
with
towels
,
soap
,
mirrors
,
and
all
such
convenient
*NL*
comforts
,
with
indeed
our
toothbrushes
and
combs
,
our
notebooks
,
and
*NL*
thank
goodness
,
our
watches
--
but
no
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
made
a
search
of
the
big
room
again
and
found
a
large
airy
*NL*
closet
,
holding
plenty
of
clothing
,
but
not
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
council
of
war
!
''
demanded
Terry
.
``
Come
on
back
to
bed
--
the
bed
's
all
*NL*
right
anyhow
.
Now
then
,
my
scientific
friend
,
let
us
consider
our
case
*NL*
dispassionately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
meant
me
,
but
Jeff
seemed
most
impressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
n't
hurt
us
in
the
least
!
''
he
said
.
``
They
could
have
killed
*NL*
us
--
or
--
or
anything
--
and
I
never
felt
better
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
argues
that
they
are
all
women
,
''
I
suggested
,
``
and
highly
*NL*
civilized
.
You
know
you
hit
one
in
the
last
scrimmage
--
I
heard
her
sing
*NL*
out
--
and
we
kicked
awfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
grinning
at
us
.
``
So
you
realize
what
these
ladies
have
done
to
*NL*
us
?
''
he
pleasantly
inquired
.
``
They
have
taken
away
all
our
possessions
,
*NL*
all
our
clothes
--
every
stitch
.
We
have
been
stripped
and
washed
and
put
*NL*
to
bed
like
so
many
yearling
babies
--
by
these
highly
civilized
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
actually
blushed
.
He
had
a
poetic
imagination
.
Terry
had
*NL*
imagination
enough
,
of
a
different
kind
.
So
had
I
,
also
different
.
*NL*
I
always
flattered
myself
I
had
the
scientific
imagination
,
which
,
*NL*
incidentally
,
I
considered
the
highest
sort
.
One
has
a
right
to
a
*NL*
certain
amount
of
egotism
if
founded
on
fact
--
and
kept
to
one
's
self
--
I
*NL*
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
use
kicking
,
boys
,
''
I
said
.
``
They
've
got
us
,
and
apparently
they
're
*NL*
perfectly
harmless
.
It
remains
for
us
to
cook
up
some
plan
of
escape
*NL*
like
any
other
bottled
heroes
.
Meanwhile
we
've
got
to
put
on
these
*NL*
clothes
--
Hobson
's
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
garments
were
simple
in
the
extreme
,
and
absolutely
comfortable
,
*NL*
physically
,
though
of
course
we
all
felt
like
supes
in
the
theater
.
*NL*
There
was
a
one-piece
cotton
undergarment
,
thin
and
soft
,
that
reached
*NL*
over
the
knees
and
shoulders
,
something
like
the
one-piece
pajamas
some
*NL*
fellows
wear
,
and
a
kind
of
half-hose
,
that
came
up
to
just
under
the
*NL*
knee
and
stayed
there
--
had
elastic
tops
of
their
own
,
and
covered
the
*NL*
edges
of
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
a
thicker
variety
of
union
suit
,
a
lot
of
them
in
the
*NL*
closet
,
of
varying
weights
and
somewhat
sturdier
material
--
evidently
*NL*
they
would
do
at
a
pinch
with
nothing
further
.
Then
there
were
tunics
,
*NL*
knee-length
,
and
some
long
robes
.
Needless
to
say
,
we
took
tunics
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
bathed
and
dressed
quite
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
half
bad
,
''
said
Terry
,
surveying
himself
in
a
long
mirror
.
His
*NL*
hair
was
somewhat
longer
than
when
we
left
the
last
barber
,
and
the
*NL*
hats
provided
were
much
like
those
seen
on
the
prince
in
the
fairy
tale
,
*NL*
lacking
the
plume
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
costume
was
similar
to
that
which
we
had
seen
on
all
the
women
,
*NL*
though
some
of
them
,
those
working
in
the
fields
,
glimpsed
by
our
*NL*
glasses
when
we
first
flew
over
,
wore
only
the
first
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
settled
my
shoulders
and
stretched
my
arms
,
remarking
:
``
They
have
*NL*
worked
out
a
mighty
sensible
dress
,
I
'll
say
that
for
them
.
''
With
which
*NL*
we
all
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
''
Terry
proclaimed
,
``
we
've
had
a
fine
long
sleep
--
we
've
had
a
*NL*
good
bath
--
we
're
clothed
and
in
our
right
minds
,
though
feeling
like
a
*NL*
lot
of
neuters
.
Do
you
think
these
highly
civilized
ladies
are
going
to
*NL*
give
us
any
breakfast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
they
will
,
''
Jeff
asserted
confidently
.
``
If
they
had
meant
to
*NL*
kill
us
,
they
would
have
done
it
before
.
I
believe
we
are
going
to
be
*NL*
treated
as
guests
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hailed
as
deliverers
,
I
think
,
''
said
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Studied
as
curiosities
,
''
I
told
them
.
``
But
anyhow
,
we
want
food
.
So
now
*NL*
for
a
sortie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sortie
was
not
so
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bathroom
only
opened
into
our
chamber
,
and
that
had
but
one
outlet
,
*NL*
a
big
heavy
door
,
which
was
fastened
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
someone
outside
,
''
Jeff
suggested
.
``
Let
's
knock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
knocked
,
whereupon
the
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
was
another
large
room
,
furnished
with
a
great
table
at
one
*NL*
end
,
long
benches
or
couches
against
the
wall
,
some
smaller
tables
*NL*
and
chairs
.
All
these
were
solid
,
strong
,
simple
in
structure
,
and
*NL*
comfortable
in
use
--
also
,
incidentally
,
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
room
was
occupied
by
a
number
of
women
,
eighteen
to
be
exact
,
some
*NL*
of
whom
we
distinctly
recalled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
heaved
a
disappointed
sigh
.
``
The
Colonels
!
''
I
heard
him
whisper
to
*NL*
Jeff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
,
however
,
advanced
and
bowed
in
his
best
manner
;
so
did
we
all
,
and
*NL*
we
were
saluted
civilly
by
the
tall-standing
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
no
need
to
make
pathetic
pantomime
of
hunger
;
the
smaller
tables
*NL*
were
already
laid
with
food
,
and
we
were
gravely
invited
to
be
seated
.
*NL*
The
tables
were
set
for
two
;
each
of
us
found
ourselves
placed
vis-a-vis
*NL*
with
one
of
our
hosts
,
and
each
table
had
five
other
stalwarts
nearby
,
*NL*
unobtrusively
watching
.
We
had
plenty
of
time
to
get
tired
of
those
*NL*
women
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
breakfast
was
not
profuse
,
but
sufficient
in
amount
and
excellent
in
*NL*
quality
.
We
were
all
too
good
travelers
to
object
to
novelty
,
and
this
*NL*
repast
with
its
new
but
delicious
fruit
,
its
dish
of
large
rich-flavored
*NL*
nuts
,
and
its
highly
satisfactory
little
cakes
was
most
agreeable
.
There
*NL*
was
water
to
drink
,
and
a
hot
beverage
of
a
most
pleasing
quality
,
some
*NL*
preparation
like
cocoa
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
and
there
,
willy-nilly
,
before
we
had
satisfied
our
appetites
,
*NL*
our
education
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
each
of
our
plates
lay
a
little
book
,
a
real
printed
book
,
though
*NL*
different
from
ours
both
in
paper
and
binding
,
as
well
,
of
course
,
as
in
*NL*
type
.
We
examined
them
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shades
of
Sauveur
!
''
muttered
Terry
.
``
We
're
to
learn
the
language
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
indeed
to
learn
the
language
,
and
not
only
that
,
but
to
teach
*NL*
our
own
.
There
were
blank
books
with
parallel
columns
,
neatly
ruled
,
*NL*
evidently
prepared
for
the
occasion
,
and
in
these
,
as
fast
as
we
learned
*NL*
and
wrote
down
the
name
of
anything
,
we
were
urged
to
write
our
own
name
*NL*
for
it
by
its
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
book
we
had
to
study
was
evidently
a
schoolbook
,
one
in
which
*NL*
children
learned
to
read
,
and
we
judged
from
this
,
and
from
their
*NL*
frequent
consultation
as
to
methods
,
that
they
had
had
no
previous
*NL*
experience
in
the
art
of
teaching
foreigners
their
language
,
or
of
*NL*
learning
any
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
what
they
lacked
in
experience
,
they
made
up
for
*NL*
in
genius
.
Such
subtle
understanding
,
such
instant
recognition
of
our
*NL*
difficulties
,
and
readiness
to
meet
them
,
were
a
constant
surprise
to
*NL*
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
we
were
willing
to
meet
them
halfway
.
It
was
wholly
to
*NL*
our
advantage
to
be
able
to
understand
and
speak
with
them
,
and
as
*NL*
to
refusing
to
teach
them
--
why
should
we
?
Later
on
we
did
try
open
*NL*
rebellion
,
but
only
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
first
meal
was
pleasant
enough
,
each
of
us
quietly
studying
*NL*
his
companion
,
Jeff
with
sincere
admiration
,
Terry
with
that
highly
*NL*
technical
look
of
his
,
as
of
a
past
master
--
like
a
lion
tamer
,
a
serpent
*NL*
charmer
,
or
some
such
professional
.
I
myself
was
intensely
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
those
sets
of
five
were
there
to
check
any
outbreak
*NL*
on
our
part
.
We
had
no
weapons
,
and
if
we
did
try
to
do
any
damage
,
with
*NL*
a
chair
,
say
,
why
five
to
one
was
too
many
for
us
,
even
if
they
were
*NL*
women
;
that
we
had
found
out
to
our
sorrow
.
It
was
not
pleasant
,
having
*NL*
them
always
around
,
but
we
soon
got
used
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
better
than
being
physically
restrained
ourselves
,
''
Jeff
*NL*
philosophically
suggested
when
we
were
alone
.
``
They
've
given
us
a
*NL*
room
--
with
no
great
possibility
of
escape
--
and
personal
liberty
--
heavily
*NL*
chaperoned
.
It
's
better
than
we
'd
have
been
likely
to
get
in
a
*NL*
man-country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man-Country
!
Do
you
really
believe
there
are
no
men
here
,
you
innocent
?
*NL*
Do
n't
you
know
there
must
be
?
''
demanded
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
--
es
,
''
Jeff
agreed
.
``
Of
course
--
and
yet
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
--
what
!
Come
,
you
obdurate
sentimentalist
--
what
are
you
thinking
*NL*
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
may
have
some
peculiar
division
of
labor
we
've
never
heard
of
,
''
I
*NL*
suggested
.
``
The
men
may
live
in
separate
towns
,
or
they
may
have
subdued
*NL*
them
--
somehow
--
and
keep
them
shut
up
.
But
there
must
be
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
last
suggestion
of
yours
is
a
nice
one
,
Van
,
''
Terry
protested
.
*NL*
``
Same
as
they
've
got
us
subdued
and
shut
up
!
you
make
me
shiver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
figure
it
out
for
yourself
,
anyway
you
please
.
We
saw
plenty
of
*NL*
kids
,
the
first
day
,
and
we
've
seen
those
girls
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Real
girls
!
''
Terry
agreed
,
in
immense
relief
.
``
Glad
you
mentioned
*NL*
'em
.
I
declare
,
if
I
thought
there
was
nothing
in
the
country
but
those
*NL*
grenadiers
I
'd
jump
out
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speaking
of
windows
,
''
I
suggested
,
``
let
's
examine
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
out
of
all
the
windows
.
The
blinds
opened
easily
enough
,
and
*NL*
there
were
no
bars
,
but
the
prospect
was
not
reassuring
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
the
pink-walled
town
we
had
so
rashly
entered
the
day
*NL*
before
.
Our
chamber
was
high
up
,
in
a
projecting
wing
of
a
sort
of
*NL*
castle
,
built
out
on
a
steep
spur
of
rock
.
Immediately
below
us
were
*NL*
gardens
,
fruitful
and
fragrant
,
but
their
high
walls
followed
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
cliff
which
dropped
sheer
down
,
we
could
not
see
how
far
.
The
*NL*
distant
sound
of
water
suggested
a
river
at
the
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
could
look
out
east
,
west
,
and
south
.
To
the
southeastward
stretched
*NL*
the
open
country
,
lying
bright
and
fair
in
the
morning
light
,
but
on
*NL*
either
side
,
and
evidently
behind
,
rose
great
mountains
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
thing
is
a
regular
fortress
--
and
no
women
built
it
,
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
that
,
''
said
Terry
.
We
nodded
agreeingly
.
``
It
's
right
up
among
the
*NL*
hills
--
they
must
have
brought
us
a
long
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
saw
some
kind
of
swift-moving
vehicles
the
first
day
,
''
Jeff
reminded
*NL*
us
.
``
If
they
've
got
motors
,
they
ARE
civilized
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Civilized
or
not
,
we
've
got
our
work
cut
out
for
us
to
get
away
from
*NL*
here
.
I
do
n't
propose
to
make
a
rope
of
bedclothes
and
try
those
walls
*NL*
till
I
'm
sure
there
is
no
better
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
concurred
on
this
point
,
and
returned
to
our
discussion
as
to
the
*NL*
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
continued
thoughtful
.
``
All
the
same
,
there
's
something
funny
about
*NL*
it
,
''
he
urged
.
``
It
is
n't
just
that
we
do
n't
see
any
men
--
but
we
do
n't
*NL*
see
any
signs
of
them
.
The
--
the
--
reaction
of
these
women
is
different
*NL*
from
any
that
I
've
ever
met
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
in
what
you
say
,
Jeff
,
''
I
agreed
.
``
There
is
a
*NL*
different
--
atmosphere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
seem
to
notice
our
being
men
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
They
treat
*NL*
us
--
well
--
just
as
they
do
one
another
.
It
's
as
if
our
being
men
was
a
*NL*
minor
incident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
nodded
.
I
'd
noticed
it
myself
.
But
Terry
broke
in
rudely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fiddlesticks
!
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
because
of
their
advanced
age
.
They
're
*NL*
all
grandmas
,
I
tell
you
--
or
ought
to
be
.
Great
aunts
,
anyhow
.
Those
*NL*
girls
were
girls
all
right
,
were
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
''
Jeff
agreed
,
still
slowly
.
``
But
they
were
n't
afraid
--
they
flew
*NL*
up
that
tree
and
hid
,
like
schoolboys
caught
out
of
bounds
--
not
like
shy
*NL*
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
ran
like
marathon
winners
--
you
'll
admit
that
,
Terry
,
''
he
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
moody
as
the
days
passed
.
He
seemed
to
mind
our
confinement
*NL*
more
than
Jeff
or
I
did
;
and
he
harped
on
Alima
,
and
how
near
he
'd
come
*NL*
to
catching
her
.
``
If
I
had
--
''
he
would
say
,
rather
savagely
,
``
we
'd
have
*NL*
had
a
hostage
and
could
have
made
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jeff
was
getting
on
excellent
terms
with
his
tutor
,
and
even
his
*NL*
guards
,
and
so
was
I
.
It
interested
me
profoundly
to
note
and
study
*NL*
the
subtle
difference
between
these
women
and
other
women
,
and
try
to
*NL*
account
for
them
.
In
the
matter
of
personal
appearance
,
there
was
a
*NL*
great
difference
.
They
all
wore
short
hair
,
some
few
inches
at
most
;
*NL*
some
curly
,
some
not
;
all
light
and
clean
and
fresh-looking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
their
hair
was
only
long
,
''
Jeff
would
complain
,
``
they
would
look
so
*NL*
much
more
feminine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rather
liked
it
myself
,
after
I
got
used
to
it
.
Why
we
should
so
*NL*
admire
``
a
woman
's
crown
of
hair
''
and
not
admire
a
Chinaman
's
queue
is
*NL*
hard
to
explain
,
except
that
we
are
so
convinced
that
the
long
hair
*NL*
``
belongs
''
to
a
woman
.
Whereas
the
``
mane
''
in
horses
is
on
both
,
and
in
*NL*
lions
,
buffalos
,
and
such
creatures
only
on
the
male
.
But
I
did
miss
*NL*
it
--
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
time
was
quite
pleasantly
filled
.
We
were
free
of
the
garden
below
*NL*
our
windows
,
quite
long
in
its
irregular
rambling
shape
,
bordering
the
*NL*
cliff
.
The
walls
were
perfectly
smooth
and
high
,
ending
in
the
masonry
*NL*
of
the
building
;
and
as
I
studied
the
great
stones
I
became
convinced
*NL*
that
the
whole
structure
was
extremely
old
.
It
was
built
like
the
*NL*
pre-Incan
architecture
in
Peru
,
of
enormous
monoliths
,
fitted
as
closely
*NL*
as
mosaics
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
folks
have
a
history
,
that
's
sure
,
''
I
told
the
others
.
``
And
SOME
*NL*
time
they
were
fighters
--
else
why
a
fortress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
we
were
free
of
the
garden
,
but
not
wholly
alone
in
it
.
There
*NL*
was
always
a
string
of
those
uncomfortably
strong
women
sitting
about
,
*NL*
always
one
of
them
watching
us
even
if
the
others
were
reading
,
playing
*NL*
games
,
or
busy
at
some
kind
of
handiwork
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
see
them
knit
,
''
Terry
said
,
``
I
can
almost
call
them
feminine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
n't
prove
anything
,
''
Jeff
promptly
replied
.
``
Scotch
shepherds
*NL*
knit
--
always
knitting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
get
out
--
''
Terry
stretched
himself
and
looked
at
the
far
*NL*
peaks
,
``
when
we
get
out
of
this
and
get
to
where
the
real
women
are
--
the
*NL*
mothers
,
and
the
girls
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
'll
we
do
then
?
''
I
asked
,
rather
gloomily
.
``
How
do
you
know
*NL*
we
'll
ever
get
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
unpleasant
idea
,
which
we
unanimously
considered
,
returning
*NL*
with
earnestness
to
our
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
are
good
boys
and
learn
our
lessons
well
,
''
I
suggested
.
``
If
we
*NL*
are
quiet
and
respectful
and
polite
and
they
are
not
afraid
of
us
--
then
*NL*
perhaps
they
will
let
us
out
.
And
anyway
--
when
we
do
escape
,
it
is
of
*NL*
immense
importance
that
we
know
the
language
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Personally
,
I
was
tremendously
interested
in
that
language
,
and
seeing
*NL*
they
had
books
,
was
eager
to
get
at
them
,
to
dig
into
their
history
,
if
*NL*
they
had
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
hard
to
speak
,
smooth
and
pleasant
to
the
ear
,
and
so
easy
*NL*
to
read
and
write
that
I
marveled
at
it
.
They
had
an
absolutely
phonetic
*NL*
system
,
the
whole
thing
was
as
scientific
as
Esparanto
yet
bore
all
the
*NL*
marks
of
an
old
and
rich
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
free
to
study
as
much
as
we
wished
,
and
were
not
left
merely
to
*NL*
wander
in
the
garden
for
recreation
but
introduced
to
a
great
gymnasium
,
*NL*
partly
on
the
roof
and
partly
in
the
story
below
.
Here
we
learned
real
*NL*
respect
for
our
tall
guards
.
No
change
of
costume
was
needed
for
this
*NL*
work
,
save
to
lay
off
outer
clothing
.
The
first
one
was
as
perfect
a
*NL*
garment
for
exercise
as
need
be
devised
,
absolutely
free
to
move
in
,
*NL*
and
,
I
had
to
admit
,
much
better-looking
than
our
usual
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty
--
over
forty
--
some
of
'em
fifty
,
I
bet
--
and
look
at
'em
!
''
grumbled
*NL*
Terry
in
reluctant
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
spectacular
acrobatics
,
such
as
only
the
young
can
*NL*
perform
,
but
for
all-around
development
they
had
a
most
excellent
*NL*
system
.
A
good
deal
of
music
went
with
it
,
with
posture
dancing
and
,
*NL*
sometimes
,
gravely
beautiful
processional
performances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
was
much
impressed
by
it
.
We
did
not
know
then
how
small
a
part
of
*NL*
their
physical
culture
methods
this
really
was
,
but
found
it
agreeable
*NL*
to
watch
,
and
to
take
part
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
yes
,
we
took
part
all
right
!
It
was
n't
absolutely
compulsory
,
but
we
*NL*
thought
it
better
to
please
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
the
strongest
of
us
,
though
I
was
wiry
and
had
good
staying
*NL*
power
,
and
Jeff
was
a
great
sprinter
and
hurdler
,
but
I
can
tell
you
*NL*
those
old
ladies
gave
us
cards
and
spades
.
They
ran
like
deer
,
by
which
*NL*
I
mean
that
they
ran
not
as
if
it
was
a
performance
,
but
as
if
it
was
*NL*
their
natural
gait
.
We
remembered
those
fleeting
girls
of
our
first
*NL*
bright
adventure
,
and
concluded
that
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
leaped
like
deer
,
too
,
with
a
quick
folding
motion
of
the
legs
,
*NL*
drawn
up
and
turned
to
one
side
with
a
sidelong
twist
of
the
body
.
I
*NL*
remembered
the
sprawling
spread-eagle
way
in
which
some
of
the
fellows
*NL*
used
to
come
over
the
line
--
and
tried
to
learn
the
trick
.
We
did
not
*NL*
easily
catch
up
with
these
experts
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
thought
I
'd
live
to
be
bossed
by
a
lot
of
elderly
lady
acrobats
,
''
*NL*
Terry
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
games
,
too
,
a
good
many
of
them
,
but
we
found
them
rather
*NL*
uninteresting
at
first
.
It
was
like
two
people
playing
solitaire
to
*NL*
see
who
would
get
it
first
;
more
like
a
race
or
a
--
a
competitive
*NL*
examination
,
than
a
real
game
with
some
fight
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
philosophized
a
bit
over
this
and
told
Terry
it
argued
against
their
*NL*
having
any
men
about
.
``
There
is
n't
a
man-size
game
in
the
lot
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
are
interesting
--
I
like
them
,
''
Jeff
objected
,
``
and
I
'm
sure
*NL*
they
are
educational
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sick
and
tired
of
being
educated
,
''
Terry
protested
.
``
Fancy
going
to
*NL*
a
dame
school
--
at
our
age
.
I
want
to
Get
Out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
could
not
get
out
,
and
we
were
being
educated
swiftly
.
Our
*NL*
special
tutors
rose
rapidly
in
our
esteem
.
They
seemed
of
rather
finer
*NL*
quality
than
the
guards
,
though
all
were
on
terms
of
easy
friendliness
.
*NL*
Mine
was
named
Somel
,
Jeff
's
Zava
,
and
Terry
's
Moadine
.
We
tried
to
*NL*
generalize
from
the
names
,
those
of
the
guards
,
and
of
our
three
girls
,
*NL*
but
got
nowhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
sound
well
enough
,
and
they
're
mostly
short
,
but
there
's
no
*NL*
similarity
of
termination
--
and
no
two
alike
.
However
,
our
acquaintance
*NL*
is
limited
as
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
many
things
we
meant
to
ask
--
as
soon
as
we
could
talk
well
*NL*
enough
.
Better
teaching
I
never
saw
.
From
morning
to
night
there
was
*NL*
Somel
,
always
on
call
except
between
two
and
four
;
always
pleasant
with
*NL*
a
steady
friendly
kindness
that
I
grew
to
enjoy
very
much
.
Jeff
said
*NL*
Miss
Zava
--
he
would
put
on
a
title
,
though
they
apparently
had
none
--
was
*NL*
a
darling
,
that
she
reminded
him
of
his
Aunt
Esther
at
home
;
but
Terry
*NL*
refused
to
be
won
,
and
rather
jeered
at
his
own
companion
,
when
we
were
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sick
of
it
!
''
he
protested
.
``
Sick
of
the
whole
thing
.
Here
we
are
*NL*
cooped
up
as
helpless
as
a
bunch
of
three-year-old
orphans
,
and
being
*NL*
taught
what
they
think
is
necessary
--
whether
we
like
it
or
not
.
Confound
*NL*
their
old-maid
impudence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
we
were
taught
.
They
brought
in
a
raised
map
of
their
*NL*
country
,
beautifully
made
,
and
increased
our
knowledge
of
geographical
*NL*
terms
;
but
when
we
inquired
for
information
as
to
the
country
outside
,
*NL*
they
smilingly
shook
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
brought
pictures
,
not
only
the
engravings
in
the
books
but
colored
*NL*
studies
of
plants
and
trees
and
flowers
and
birds
.
They
brought
tools
*NL*
and
various
small
objects
--
we
had
plenty
of
``
material
''
in
our
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
not
been
for
Terry
we
would
have
been
much
more
contented
,
but
*NL*
as
the
weeks
ran
into
months
he
grew
more
and
more
irritable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
act
like
a
bear
with
a
sore
head
,
''
I
begged
him
.
``
We
're
getting
*NL*
on
finely
.
Every
day
we
can
understand
them
better
,
and
pretty
soon
we
*NL*
can
make
a
reasonable
plea
to
be
let
out
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
LET
out
!
''
he
stormed
.
``
LET
out
--
like
children
kept
after
school
.
I
want
*NL*
to
Get
Out
,
and
I
'm
going
to
.
I
want
to
find
the
men
of
this
place
and
*NL*
fight
!
--
or
the
girls
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guess
it
's
the
girls
you
're
most
interested
in
,
''
Jeff
commented
.
``
What
*NL*
are
you
going
to
fight
WITH
--
your
fists
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
or
sticks
and
stones
--
I
'd
just
like
to
!
''
And
Terry
squared
off
and
*NL*
tapped
Jeff
softly
on
the
jaw
.
``
Just
for
instance
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
we
could
get
back
to
our
machine
and
clear
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
's
there
,
''
I
cautiously
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
croak
,
Van
!
If
it
is
n't
there
,
we
'll
find
our
way
down
*NL*
somehow
--
the
boat
's
there
,
I
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
hard
on
Terry
,
so
hard
that
he
finally
persuaded
us
to
consider
*NL*
a
plan
of
escape
.
It
was
difficult
,
it
was
highly
dangerous
,
but
he
*NL*
declared
that
he
'd
go
alone
if
we
would
n't
go
with
him
,
and
of
course
we
*NL*
could
n't
think
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
he
had
made
a
pretty
careful
study
of
the
environment
.
From
*NL*
our
end
window
that
faced
the
point
of
the
promontory
we
could
get
a
*NL*
fair
idea
of
the
stretch
of
wall
,
and
the
drop
below
.
Also
from
the
roof
*NL*
we
could
make
out
more
,
and
even
,
in
one
place
,
glimpse
a
sort
of
path
*NL*
below
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
question
of
three
things
,
''
he
said
.
``
Ropes
,
agility
,
and
not
*NL*
being
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
hardest
part
,
''
I
urged
,
still
hoping
to
dissuade
him
.
``
One
*NL*
or
another
pair
of
eyes
is
on
us
every
minute
except
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
we
must
do
it
at
night
,
''
he
answered
.
``
That
's
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
got
to
think
that
if
they
catch
us
we
may
not
be
so
well
treated
*NL*
afterward
,
''
said
Jeff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
business
risk
we
must
take
.
I
'm
going
--
if
I
break
my
neck
.
''
*NL*
There
was
no
changing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rope
problem
was
not
easy
.
Something
strong
enough
to
hold
a
man
and
*NL*
long
enough
to
let
us
down
into
the
garden
,
and
then
down
over
the
wall
.
*NL*
There
were
plenty
of
strong
ropes
in
the
gymnasium
--
they
seemed
to
love
*NL*
to
swing
and
climb
on
them
--
but
we
were
never
there
by
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
should
have
to
piece
it
out
from
our
bedding
,
rugs
,
and
garments
,
and
*NL*
moreover
,
we
should
have
to
do
it
after
we
were
shut
in
for
the
*NL*
night
,
for
every
day
the
place
was
cleaned
to
perfection
by
two
of
our
*NL*
guardians
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
no
shears
,
no
knives
,
but
Terry
was
resourceful
.
``
These
Jennies
*NL*
have
glass
and
china
,
you
see
.
We
'll
break
a
glass
from
the
bathroom
and
*NL*
use
that
.
`
Love
will
find
out
a
way
,
'
''
he
hummed
.
``
When
we
're
all
out
of
*NL*
the
window
,
we
'll
stand
three-man
high
and
cut
the
rope
as
far
up
as
we
*NL*
can
reach
,
so
as
to
have
more
for
the
wall
.
I
know
just
where
I
saw
*NL*
that
bit
of
path
below
,
and
there
's
a
big
tree
there
,
too
,
or
a
vine
or
*NL*
something
--
I
saw
the
leaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
a
crazy
risk
to
take
,
but
this
was
,
in
a
way
,
Terry
's
*NL*
expedition
,
and
we
were
all
tired
of
our
imprisonment
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
waited
for
full
moon
,
retired
early
,
and
spent
an
anxious
hour
or
*NL*
two
in
the
unskilled
manufacture
of
man-strong
ropes
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
retire
into
the
depths
of
the
closet
,
muffle
a
glass
in
thick
cloth
,
*NL*
and
break
it
without
noise
was
not
difficult
,
and
broken
glass
will
cut
,
*NL*
though
not
as
deftly
as
a
pair
of
scissors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
broad
moonlight
streamed
in
through
four
of
our
windows
--
we
had
not
*NL*
dared
leave
our
lights
on
too
long
--
and
we
worked
hard
and
fast
at
our
*NL*
task
of
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hangings
,
rugs
,
robes
,
towels
,
as
well
as
bed-furniture
--
even
the
*NL*
mattress
covers
--
we
left
not
one
stitch
upon
another
,
as
Jeff
put
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
at
an
end
window
,
as
less
liable
to
observation
,
we
fastened
one
*NL*
end
of
our
cable
,
strongly
,
to
the
firm-set
hinge
of
the
inner
blind
,
*NL*
and
dropped
our
coiled
bundle
of
rope
softly
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
part
's
easy
enough
--
I
'll
come
last
,
so
as
to
cut
the
rope
,
''
said
*NL*
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
slipped
down
first
,
and
stood
,
well
braced
against
the
wall
;
then
*NL*
Jeff
on
my
shoulders
,
then
Terry
,
who
shook
us
a
little
as
he
sawed
*NL*
through
the
cord
above
his
head
.
Then
I
slowly
dropped
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
Jeff
following
,
and
at
last
we
all
three
stood
safe
in
the
garden
,
with
*NL*
most
of
our
rope
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Grandma
!
''
whispered
Terry
,
under
his
breath
,
and
we
crept
*NL*
softly
toward
the
wall
,
taking
advantage
of
the
shadow
of
every
bush
*NL*
and
tree
.
He
had
been
foresighted
enough
to
mark
the
very
spot
,
only
a
*NL*
scratch
of
stone
on
stone
,
but
we
could
see
to
read
in
that
light
.
For
*NL*
anchorage
there
was
a
tough
,
fair-sized
shrub
close
to
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
'll
climb
up
on
you
two
again
and
go
over
first
,
''
said
Terry
.
*NL*
``
That
'll
hold
the
rope
firm
till
you
both
get
up
on
top
.
Then
I
'll
go
*NL*
down
to
the
end
.
If
I
can
get
off
safely
,
you
can
see
me
and
follow
--
or
,
*NL*
say
,
I
'll
twitch
it
three
times
.
If
I
find
there
's
absolutely
no
*NL*
footing
--
why
I
'll
climb
up
again
,
that
's
all
.
I
do
n't
think
they
'll
kill
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
top
he
reconnoitered
carefully
,
waved
his
hand
,
and
whispered
,
*NL*
``
OK
,
''
then
slipped
over
.
Jeff
climbed
up
and
I
followed
,
and
we
rather
*NL*
shivered
to
see
how
far
down
that
swaying
,
wavering
figure
dropped
,
hand
*NL*
under
hand
,
till
it
disappeared
in
a
mass
of
foliage
far
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
were
three
quick
pulls
,
and
Jeff
and
I
,
not
without
a
joyous
*NL*
sense
of
recovered
freedom
,
successfully
followed
our
leader
.

CHAPTER
4
.
Our
Venture
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
standing
on
a
narrow
,
irregular
,
all
too
slanting
little
ledge
,
*NL*
and
should
doubtless
have
ignominiously
slipped
off
and
broken
our
rash
*NL*
necks
but
for
the
vine
.
This
was
a
thick-leaved
,
wide-spreading
thing
,
a
*NL*
little
like
Amphelopsis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
QUITE
vertical
here
,
you
see
,
''
said
Terry
,
full
of
pride
and
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
``
This
thing
never
would
hold
our
direct
weight
,
but
I
think
*NL*
if
we
sort
of
slide
down
on
it
,
one
at
a
time
,
sticking
in
with
hands
*NL*
and
feet
,
we
'll
reach
that
next
ledge
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
we
do
not
wish
to
get
up
our
rope
again
--
and
ca
n't
comfortably
stay
*NL*
here
--
I
approve
,
''
said
Jeff
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
slid
down
first
--
said
he
'd
show
us
how
a
Christian
meets
*NL*
his
death
.
Luck
was
with
us
.
We
had
put
on
the
thickest
of
those
*NL*
intermediate
suits
,
leaving
our
tunics
behind
,
and
made
this
scramble
*NL*
quite
successfully
,
though
I
got
a
pretty
heavy
fall
just
at
the
end
,
*NL*
and
was
only
kept
on
the
second
ledge
by
main
force
.
The
next
stage
*NL*
was
down
a
sort
of
``
chimney
''
--
a
long
irregular
fissure
;
and
so
with
*NL*
scratches
many
and
painful
and
bruises
not
a
few
,
we
finally
reached
the
*NL*
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
darker
there
,
but
we
felt
it
highly
necessary
to
put
as
much
*NL*
distance
as
possible
behind
us
;
so
we
waded
,
jumped
,
and
clambered
down
*NL*
that
rocky
riverbed
,
in
the
flickering
black
and
white
moonlight
and
*NL*
leaf
shadow
,
till
growing
daylight
forced
a
halt
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
a
friendly
nut-tree
,
those
large
,
satisfying
,
soft-shelled
nuts
*NL*
we
already
knew
so
well
,
and
filled
our
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
that
I
have
not
remarked
that
these
women
had
pockets
in
*NL*
surprising
number
and
variety
.
They
were
in
all
their
garments
,
and
the
*NL*
middle
one
in
particular
was
shingled
with
them
.
So
we
stocked
up
with
*NL*
nuts
till
we
bulged
like
Prussian
privates
in
marching
order
,
drank
all
*NL*
we
could
hold
,
and
retired
for
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
very
comfortable
place
,
not
at
all
easy
to
get
at
,
just
*NL*
a
sort
of
crevice
high
up
along
the
steep
bank
,
but
it
was
well
veiled
*NL*
with
foliage
and
dry
.
After
our
exhaustive
three
-
or
four-hour
scramble
*NL*
and
the
good
breakfast
food
,
we
all
lay
down
along
that
crack
--
heads
and
*NL*
tails
,
as
it
were
--
and
slept
till
the
afternoon
sun
almost
toasted
our
*NL*
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
poked
a
tentative
foot
against
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
,
Van
?
Alive
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
so
,
''
I
told
him
.
And
Jeff
was
equally
cheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
room
to
stretch
,
if
not
to
turn
around
;
but
we
could
very
*NL*
carefully
roll
over
,
one
at
a
time
,
behind
the
sheltering
foliage
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
use
to
leave
there
by
daylight
.
We
could
not
see
much
of
the
*NL*
country
,
but
enough
to
know
that
we
were
now
at
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
cultivated
area
,
and
no
doubt
there
would
be
an
alarm
sent
out
far
and
*NL*
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
chuckled
softly
to
himself
,
lying
there
on
that
hot
narrow
little
*NL*
rim
of
rock
.
He
dilated
on
the
discomfiture
of
our
guards
and
tutors
,
*NL*
making
many
discourteous
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
reminded
him
that
we
had
still
a
long
way
to
go
before
getting
to
*NL*
the
place
where
we
'd
left
our
machine
,
and
no
probability
of
finding
it
*NL*
there
;
but
he
only
kicked
me
,
mildly
,
for
a
croaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
ca
n't
boost
,
do
n't
knock
,
''
he
protested
.
``
I
never
said
`
twould
*NL*
be
a
picnic
.
But
I
'd
run
away
in
the
Antarctic
ice
fields
rather
than
be
*NL*
a
prisoner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
soon
dozed
off
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
long
rest
and
penetrating
dry
heat
were
good
for
us
,
and
that
night
*NL*
we
covered
a
considerable
distance
,
keeping
always
in
the
rough
forested
*NL*
belt
of
land
which
we
knew
bordered
the
whole
country
.
Sometimes
we
were
*NL*
near
the
outer
edge
,
and
caught
sudden
glimpses
of
the
tremendous
depths
*NL*
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
piece
of
geography
stands
up
like
a
basalt
column
,
''
Jeff
said
.
*NL*
``
Nice
time
we
'll
have
getting
down
if
they
have
confiscated
our
*NL*
machine
!
''
For
which
suggestion
he
received
summary
chastisement
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
we
could
see
inland
was
peaceable
enough
,
but
only
moonlit
*NL*
glimpses
;
by
daylight
we
lay
very
close
.
As
Terry
said
,
we
did
not
wish
*NL*
to
kill
the
old
ladies
--
even
if
we
could
;
and
short
of
that
they
*NL*
were
perfectly
competent
to
pick
us
up
bodily
and
carry
us
back
,
if
*NL*
discovered
.
There
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
lie
low
,
and
sneak
out
*NL*
unseen
if
we
could
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
n't
much
talking
done
.
At
night
we
had
our
marathon-obstacle
*NL*
race
;
we
``
stayed
not
for
brake
and
we
stopped
not
for
stone
,
''
and
swam
*NL*
whatever
water
was
too
deep
to
wade
and
could
not
be
got
around
;
but
*NL*
that
was
only
necessary
twice
.
By
day
,
sleep
,
sound
and
sweet
.
Mighty
*NL*
lucky
it
was
that
we
could
live
off
the
country
as
we
did
.
Even
that
*NL*
margin
of
forest
seemed
rich
in
foodstuffs
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jeff
thoughtfully
suggested
that
that
very
thing
showed
how
careful
*NL*
we
should
have
to
be
,
as
we
might
run
into
some
stalwart
group
of
*NL*
gardeners
or
foresters
or
nut-gatherers
at
any
minute
.
Careful
we
were
,
*NL*
feeling
pretty
sure
that
if
we
did
not
make
good
this
time
we
were
not
*NL*
likely
to
have
another
opportunity
;
and
at
last
we
reached
a
point
from
*NL*
which
we
could
see
,
far
below
,
the
broad
stretch
of
that
still
lake
from
*NL*
which
we
had
made
our
ascent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
looks
pretty
good
to
me
!
''
said
Terry
,
gazing
down
at
it
.
``
Now
,
if
*NL*
we
ca
n't
find
the
`
plane
,
we
know
where
to
aim
if
we
have
to
drop
over
*NL*
this
wall
some
other
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wall
at
that
point
was
singularly
uninviting
.
It
rose
so
straight
*NL*
that
we
had
to
put
our
heads
over
to
see
the
base
,
and
the
country
below
*NL*
seemed
to
be
a
far-off
marshy
tangle
of
rank
vegetation
.
We
did
not
have
*NL*
to
risk
our
necks
to
that
extent
,
however
,
for
at
last
,
stealing
along
*NL*
among
the
rocks
and
trees
like
so
many
creeping
savages
,
we
came
to
that
*NL*
flat
space
where
we
had
landed
;
and
there
,
in
unbelievable
good
fortune
,
*NL*
we
found
our
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Covered
,
too
,
by
jingo
!
Would
you
think
they
had
that
much
sense
?
''
*NL*
cried
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
had
that
much
,
they
're
likely
to
have
more
,
''
I
warned
him
,
*NL*
softly
.
``
Bet
you
the
thing
's
watched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
reconnoitered
as
widely
as
we
could
in
the
failing
moonlight
--
moons
*NL*
are
of
a
painfully
unreliable
nature
;
but
the
growing
dawn
showed
us
*NL*
the
familiar
shape
,
shrouded
in
some
heavy
cloth
like
canvas
,
and
no
*NL*
slightest
sign
of
any
watchman
near
.
We
decided
to
make
a
quick
dash
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
light
was
strong
enough
for
accurate
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
if
the
old
thing
'll
go
or
not
,
''
Terry
declared
.
``
We
can
*NL*
run
her
to
the
edge
,
get
aboard
,
and
just
plane
down
--
plop
!
--
beside
our
*NL*
boat
there
.
Look
there
--
see
the
boat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
--
there
was
our
motor
,
lying
like
a
gray
cocoon
on
the
flat
*NL*
pale
sheet
of
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quietly
but
swiftly
we
rushed
forward
and
began
to
tug
at
the
fastenings
*NL*
of
that
cover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
the
thing
!
''
Terry
cried
in
desperate
impatience
.
``
They
've
got
*NL*
it
sewed
up
in
a
bag
!
And
we
've
not
a
knife
among
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
we
tugged
and
pulled
at
that
tough
cloth
we
heard
a
sound
that
*NL*
made
Terry
lift
his
head
like
a
war
horse
--
the
sound
of
an
unmistakable
*NL*
giggle
,
yes
--
three
giggles
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
they
were
--
Celis
,
Alima
,
Ellador
--
looking
just
as
they
had
when
*NL*
we
first
saw
them
,
standing
a
little
way
off
from
us
,
as
interested
,
as
*NL*
mischievous
as
three
schoolboys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
,
Terry
--
hold
on
!
''
I
warned
.
``
That
's
too
easy
.
Look
out
for
a
*NL*
trap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
appeal
to
their
kind
hearts
,
''
Jeff
urged
.
``
I
think
they
will
*NL*
help
us
.
Perhaps
they
've
got
knives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
rushing
them
,
anyhow
,
''
I
was
absolutely
holding
on
to
*NL*
Terry
.
``
We
know
they
can
out-run
and
out-climb
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reluctantly
admitted
this
;
and
after
a
brief
parley
among
ourselves
,
*NL*
we
all
advanced
slowly
toward
them
,
holding
out
our
hands
in
token
of
*NL*
friendliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
their
ground
till
we
had
come
fairly
near
,
and
then
indicated
*NL*
that
we
should
stop
.
To
make
sure
,
we
advanced
a
step
or
two
and
they
*NL*
promptly
and
swiftly
withdrew
.
So
we
stopped
at
the
distance
specified
.
*NL*
Then
we
used
their
language
,
as
far
as
we
were
able
,
to
explain
our
*NL*
plight
,
telling
how
we
were
imprisoned
,
how
we
had
escaped
--
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
pantomime
here
and
vivid
interest
on
their
part
--
how
we
had
traveled
*NL*
by
night
and
hidden
by
day
,
living
on
nuts
--
and
here
Terry
pretended
*NL*
great
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
he
could
not
have
been
hungry
;
we
had
found
plenty
to
eat
and
*NL*
had
not
been
sparing
in
helping
ourselves
.
But
they
seemed
somewhat
*NL*
impressed
;
and
after
a
murmured
consultation
they
produced
from
their
*NL*
pockets
certain
little
packages
,
and
with
the
utmost
ease
and
accuracy
*NL*
tossed
them
into
our
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
was
most
appreciative
of
this
;
and
Terry
made
extravagant
gestures
*NL*
of
admiration
,
which
seemed
to
set
them
off
,
boy-fashion
,
to
show
their
*NL*
skill
.
While
we
ate
the
excellent
biscuits
they
had
thrown
us
,
and
while
*NL*
Ellador
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
our
movements
,
Celis
ran
off
to
some
*NL*
distance
,
and
set
up
a
sort
of
``
duck-on-a-rock
''
arrangement
,
a
big
*NL*
yellow
nut
on
top
of
three
balanced
sticks
;
Alima
,
meanwhile
,
gathering
*NL*
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
urged
us
to
throw
at
it
,
and
we
did
,
but
the
thing
was
a
long
way
*NL*
off
,
and
it
was
only
after
a
number
of
failures
,
at
which
those
elvish
*NL*
damsels
laughed
delightedly
,
that
Jeff
succeeded
in
bringing
the
whole
*NL*
structure
to
the
ground
.
It
took
me
still
longer
,
and
Terry
,
to
his
*NL*
intense
annoyance
,
came
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Celis
set
up
the
little
tripod
again
,
and
looked
back
at
us
,
*NL*
knocking
it
down
,
pointing
at
it
,
and
shaking
her
short
curls
severely
.
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
.
``
Bad
--
wrong
!
''
We
were
quite
able
to
follow
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
set
it
up
once
more
,
put
the
fat
nut
on
top
,
and
returned
*NL*
to
the
others
;
and
there
those
aggravating
girls
sat
and
took
turns
*NL*
throwing
little
stones
at
that
thing
,
while
one
stayed
by
as
a
*NL*
setter-up
;
and
they
just
popped
that
nut
off
,
two
times
out
of
three
,
*NL*
without
upsetting
the
sticks
.
Pleased
as
Punch
they
were
,
too
,
and
we
*NL*
pretended
to
be
,
but
were
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
very
friendly
over
this
game
,
but
I
told
Terry
we
'd
be
sorry
if
*NL*
we
did
n't
get
off
while
we
could
,
and
then
we
begged
for
knives
.
It
was
*NL*
easy
to
show
what
we
wanted
to
do
,
and
they
each
proudly
produced
a
sort
*NL*
of
strong
clasp-knife
from
their
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
we
said
eagerly
,
``
that
's
it
!
Please
--
''
We
had
learned
quite
a
*NL*
bit
of
their
language
,
you
see
.
And
we
just
begged
for
those
knives
,
but
*NL*
they
would
not
give
them
to
us
.
If
we
came
a
step
too
near
they
backed
*NL*
off
,
standing
light
and
eager
for
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
sort
of
use
,
''
I
said
.
``
Come
on
--
let
's
get
a
sharp
stone
or
*NL*
something
--
we
must
get
this
thing
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
hunted
about
and
found
what
edged
fragments
we
could
,
and
hacked
*NL*
away
,
but
it
was
like
trying
to
cut
sailcloth
with
a
clamshell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
hacked
and
dug
,
but
said
to
us
under
his
breath
.
``
Boys
,
we
're
in
*NL*
pretty
good
condition
--
let
's
make
a
life
and
death
dash
and
get
hold
of
*NL*
those
girls
--
we
've
got
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
drawn
rather
nearer
to
watch
our
efforts
,
and
we
did
take
*NL*
them
rather
by
surprise
;
also
,
as
Terry
said
,
our
recent
training
had
*NL*
strengthened
us
in
wind
and
limb
,
and
for
a
few
desperate
moments
those
*NL*
girls
were
scared
and
we
almost
triumphant
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
as
we
stretched
out
our
hands
,
the
distance
between
us
widened
;
*NL*
they
had
got
their
pace
apparently
,
and
then
,
though
we
ran
at
our
*NL*
utmost
speed
,
and
much
farther
than
I
thought
wise
,
they
kept
just
out
*NL*
of
reach
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stopped
breathless
,
at
last
,
at
my
repeated
admonitions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
stark
foolishness
,
''
I
urged
.
``
They
are
doing
it
on
*NL*
purpose
--
come
back
or
you
'll
be
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
went
back
,
much
slower
than
we
came
,
and
in
truth
we
were
sorry
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
reached
our
swaddled
machine
,
and
sought
again
to
tear
loose
its
*NL*
covering
,
there
rose
up
from
all
around
the
sturdy
forms
,
the
quiet
*NL*
determined
faces
we
knew
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Lord
!
''
groaned
Terry
.
``
The
Colonels
!
It
's
all
up
--
they
're
forty
to
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
use
to
fight
.
These
women
evidently
relied
on
numbers
,
not
so
*NL*
much
as
a
drilled
force
but
as
a
multitude
actuated
by
a
common
impulse
.
*NL*
They
showed
no
sign
of
fear
,
and
since
we
had
no
weapons
whatever
and
*NL*
there
were
at
least
a
hundred
of
them
,
standing
ten
deep
about
us
,
we
*NL*
gave
in
as
gracefully
as
we
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
we
looked
for
punishment
--
a
closer
imprisonment
,
solitary
*NL*
confinement
maybe
--
but
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
.
They
treated
us
as
*NL*
truants
only
,
and
as
if
they
quite
understood
our
truancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Back
we
went
,
not
under
an
anesthetic
this
time
but
skimming
along
in
*NL*
electric
motors
enough
like
ours
to
be
quite
recognizable
,
each
of
us
*NL*
in
a
separate
vehicle
with
one
able-bodied
lady
on
either
side
and
three
*NL*
facing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
pleasant
enough
,
and
talked
to
us
as
much
as
was
possible
*NL*
with
our
limited
powers
.
And
though
Terry
was
keenly
mortified
,
and
at
*NL*
first
we
all
rather
dreaded
harsh
treatment
,
I
for
one
soon
began
to
*NL*
feel
a
sort
of
pleasant
confidence
and
to
enjoy
the
trip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
were
my
five
familiar
companions
,
all
good-natured
as
could
be
,
*NL*
seeming
to
have
no
worse
feeling
than
a
mild
triumph
as
of
winning
some
*NL*
simple
game
;
and
even
that
they
politely
suppressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
good
opportunity
to
see
the
country
,
too
,
and
the
more
I
saw
*NL*
of
it
,
the
better
I
liked
it
.
We
went
too
swiftly
for
close
observation
,
*NL*
but
I
could
appreciate
perfect
roads
,
as
dustless
as
a
swept
floor
;
the
*NL*
shade
of
endless
lines
of
trees
;
the
ribbon
of
flowers
that
unrolled
*NL*
beneath
them
;
and
the
rich
comfortable
country
that
stretched
off
and
*NL*
away
,
full
of
varied
charm
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
rolled
through
many
villages
and
towns
,
and
I
soon
saw
that
the
*NL*
parklike
beauty
of
our
first-seen
city
was
no
exception
.
Our
swift
*NL*
high-sweeping
view
from
the
`
plane
had
been
most
attractive
,
but
lacked
*NL*
detail
;
and
in
that
first
day
of
struggle
and
capture
,
we
noticed
*NL*
little
.
But
now
we
were
swept
along
at
an
easy
rate
of
some
thirty
miles
*NL*
an
hour
and
covered
quite
a
good
deal
of
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stopped
for
lunch
in
quite
a
sizable
town
,
and
here
,
rolling
slowly
*NL*
through
the
streets
,
we
saw
more
of
the
population
.
They
had
come
out
*NL*
to
look
at
us
everywhere
we
had
passed
,
but
here
were
more
;
and
when
we
*NL*
went
in
to
eat
,
in
a
big
garden
place
with
little
shaded
tables
among
*NL*
the
trees
and
flowers
,
many
eyes
were
upon
us
.
And
everywhere
,
open
*NL*
country
,
village
,
or
city
--
only
women
.
Old
women
and
young
women
and
a
*NL*
great
majority
who
seemed
neither
young
nor
old
,
but
just
women
;
young
*NL*
girls
,
also
,
though
these
,
and
the
children
,
seeming
to
be
in
groups
by
*NL*
themselves
generally
,
were
less
in
evidence
.
We
caught
many
glimpses
of
*NL*
girls
and
children
in
what
seemed
to
be
schools
or
in
playgrounds
,
and
*NL*
so
far
as
we
could
judge
there
were
no
boys
.
We
all
looked
,
carefully
.
*NL*
Everyone
gazed
at
us
politely
,
kindly
,
and
with
eager
interest
.
No
one
*NL*
was
impertinent
.
We
could
catch
quite
a
bit
of
the
talk
now
,
and
all
*NL*
they
said
seemed
pleasant
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
--
before
nightfall
we
were
all
safely
back
in
our
big
room
.
The
*NL*
damage
we
had
done
was
quite
ignored
;
the
beds
as
smooth
and
comfortable
*NL*
as
before
,
new
clothing
and
towels
supplied
.
The
only
thing
those
women
*NL*
did
was
to
illuminate
the
gardens
at
night
,
and
to
set
an
extra
watch
.
*NL*
But
they
called
us
to
account
next
day
.
Our
three
tutors
,
who
had
not
*NL*
joined
in
the
recapturing
expedition
,
had
been
quite
busy
in
preparing
*NL*
for
us
,
and
now
made
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
knew
well
we
would
make
for
our
machine
,
and
also
that
there
was
no
*NL*
other
way
of
getting
down
--
alive
.
So
our
flight
had
troubled
no
one
;
all
*NL*
they
did
was
to
call
the
inhabitants
to
keep
an
eye
on
our
movements
all
*NL*
along
the
edge
of
the
forest
between
the
two
points
.
It
appeared
that
*NL*
many
of
those
nights
we
had
been
seen
,
by
careful
ladies
sitting
snugly
*NL*
in
big
trees
by
the
riverbed
,
or
up
among
the
rocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
looked
immensely
disgusted
,
but
it
struck
me
as
extremely
funny
.
*NL*
Here
we
had
been
risking
our
lives
,
hiding
and
prowling
like
outlaws
,
*NL*
living
on
nuts
and
fruit
,
getting
wet
and
cold
at
night
,
and
dry
and
hot
*NL*
by
day
,
and
all
the
while
these
estimable
women
had
just
been
waiting
*NL*
for
us
to
come
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
they
began
to
explain
,
carefully
using
such
words
as
we
could
*NL*
understand
.
It
appeared
that
we
were
considered
as
guests
of
the
*NL*
country
--
sort
of
public
wards
.
Our
first
violence
had
made
it
necessary
*NL*
to
keep
us
safeguarded
for
a
while
,
but
as
soon
as
we
learned
the
*NL*
language
--
and
would
agree
to
do
no
harm
--
they
would
show
us
all
about
*NL*
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
was
eager
to
reassure
them
.
Of
course
he
did
not
tell
on
Terry
,
but
*NL*
he
made
it
clear
that
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
,
and
that
he
would
now
*NL*
conform
.
As
to
the
language
--
we
all
fell
upon
it
with
redoubled
energy
.
*NL*
They
brought
us
books
,
in
greater
numbers
,
and
I
began
to
study
them
*NL*
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
punk
literature
,
''
Terry
burst
forth
one
day
,
when
we
were
in
*NL*
the
privacy
of
our
own
room
.
``
Of
course
one
expects
to
begin
on
*NL*
child-stories
,
but
I
would
like
something
more
interesting
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
expect
stirring
romance
and
wild
adventure
without
men
,
can
you
?
''
*NL*
I
asked
.
Nothing
irritated
Terry
more
than
to
have
us
assume
that
there
*NL*
were
no
men
;
but
there
were
no
signs
of
them
in
the
books
they
gave
us
,
*NL*
or
the
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up
!
''
he
growled
.
``
What
infernal
nonsense
you
talk
!
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
ask
'em
outright
--
we
know
enough
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
we
had
been
using
our
best
efforts
to
master
the
language
,
and
*NL*
were
able
to
read
fluently
and
to
discuss
what
we
read
with
considerable
*NL*
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
we
were
all
sitting
together
on
the
roof
--
we
three
and
*NL*
the
tutors
gathered
about
a
table
,
no
guards
about
.
We
had
been
made
to
*NL*
understand
some
time
earlier
that
if
we
would
agree
to
do
no
violence
*NL*
they
would
withdraw
their
constant
attendance
,
and
we
promised
most
*NL*
willingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
there
we
sat
,
at
ease
;
all
in
similar
dress
;
our
hair
,
by
now
,
as
*NL*
long
as
theirs
,
only
our
beards
to
distinguish
us
.
We
did
not
want
those
*NL*
beards
,
but
had
so
far
been
unable
to
induce
them
to
give
us
any
cutting
*NL*
instruments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
,
''
Terry
began
,
out
of
a
clear
sky
,
as
it
were
,
``
are
there
no
men
*NL*
in
this
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
?
''
Somel
answered
.
``
Like
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
men
,
''
Terry
indicated
his
beard
,
and
threw
back
his
broad
*NL*
shoulders
.
``
Men
,
real
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
quietly
.
``
There
are
no
men
in
this
country
.
There
has
*NL*
not
been
a
man
among
us
for
two
thousand
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
look
was
clear
and
truthful
and
she
did
not
advance
this
astonishing
*NL*
statement
as
if
it
was
astonishing
,
but
quite
as
a
matter
of
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
the
people
--
the
children
,
''
he
protested
,
not
believing
her
in
the
*NL*
least
,
but
not
wishing
to
say
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
she
smiled
.
``
I
do
not
wonder
you
are
puzzled
.
We
are
*NL*
mothers
--
all
of
us
--
but
there
are
no
fathers
.
We
thought
you
would
ask
*NL*
about
that
long
ago
--
why
have
you
not
?
''
Her
look
was
as
frankly
kind
as
*NL*
always
,
her
tone
quite
simple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
explained
that
we
had
not
felt
sufficiently
used
to
the
language
,
*NL*
making
rather
a
mess
of
it
,
I
thought
,
but
Jeff
was
franker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
excuse
us
all
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
we
admit
that
we
find
it
hard
to
*NL*
believe
?
There
is
no
such
--
possibility
--
in
the
rest
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
no
kind
of
life
where
it
is
possible
?
''
asked
Zava
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
--
some
low
forms
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
low
--
or
how
high
,
rather
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
there
are
some
rather
high
forms
of
insect
life
in
which
it
*NL*
occurs
.
Parthenogenesis
,
we
call
it
--
that
means
virgin
birth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
follow
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
BIRTH
,
we
know
,
of
course
;
but
what
is
VIRGIN
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
looked
uncomfortable
,
but
Jeff
met
the
question
quite
calmly
.
*NL*
``
Among
mating
animals
,
the
term
VIRGIN
is
applied
to
the
female
who
has
*NL*
not
mated
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
.
And
does
it
apply
to
the
male
also
?
Or
is
there
a
different
*NL*
term
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
this
over
rather
hurriedly
,
saying
that
the
same
term
would
*NL*
apply
,
but
was
seldom
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
she
said
.
``
But
one
can
not
mate
without
the
other
surely
.
Is
not
*NL*
each
then
--
virgin
--
before
mating
?
And
,
tell
me
,
have
you
any
forms
of
*NL*
life
in
which
there
is
birth
from
a
father
only
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
of
none
,
''
he
answered
,
and
I
inquired
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ask
us
to
believe
that
for
two
thousand
years
there
have
been
only
*NL*
women
here
,
and
only
girl
babies
born
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
''
answered
Somel
,
nodding
gravely
.
``
Of
course
we
know
that
*NL*
among
other
animals
it
is
not
so
,
that
there
are
fathers
as
well
as
*NL*
mothers
;
and
we
see
that
you
are
fathers
,
that
you
come
from
a
people
*NL*
who
are
of
both
kinds
.
We
have
been
waiting
,
you
see
,
for
you
to
be
able
*NL*
to
speak
freely
with
us
,
and
teach
us
about
your
country
and
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
world
.
You
know
so
much
,
you
see
,
and
we
know
only
our
own
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
our
previous
studies
we
had
been
at
some
pains
to
tell
*NL*
them
about
the
big
world
outside
,
to
draw
sketches
,
maps
,
to
make
a
*NL*
globe
,
even
,
out
of
a
spherical
fruit
,
and
show
the
size
and
relation
of
*NL*
the
countries
,
and
to
tell
of
the
numbers
of
their
people
.
All
this
had
*NL*
been
scant
and
in
outline
,
but
they
quite
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
find
I
succeed
very
poorly
in
conveying
the
impression
I
would
like
to
*NL*
of
these
women
.
So
far
from
being
ignorant
,
they
were
deeply
wise
--
that
*NL*
we
realized
more
and
more
;
and
for
clear
reasoning
,
for
real
brain
scope
*NL*
and
power
they
were
A
No.
1
,
but
there
were
a
lot
of
things
they
did
not
*NL*
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
the
evenest
tempers
,
the
most
perfect
patience
and
good
*NL*
nature
--
one
of
the
things
most
impressive
about
them
all
was
the
absence
*NL*
of
irritability
.
So
far
we
had
only
this
group
to
study
,
but
afterward
I
*NL*
found
it
a
common
trait
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
gradually
come
to
feel
that
we
were
in
the
hands
of
friends
,
and
*NL*
very
capable
ones
at
that
--
but
we
could
n't
form
any
opinion
yet
of
the
*NL*
general
level
of
these
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
want
you
to
teach
us
all
you
can
,
''
Somel
went
on
,
her
firm
shapely
*NL*
hands
clasped
on
the
table
before
her
,
her
clear
quiet
eyes
meeting
*NL*
ours
frankly
.
``
And
we
want
to
teach
you
what
we
have
that
is
novel
and
*NL*
useful
.
You
can
well
imagine
that
it
is
a
wonderful
event
to
us
,
to
have
*NL*
men
among
us
--
after
two
thousand
years
.
And
we
want
to
know
about
your
*NL*
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
she
said
about
our
importance
gave
instant
pleasure
to
Terry
.
I
*NL*
could
see
by
the
way
he
lifted
his
head
that
it
pleased
him
.
But
when
*NL*
she
spoke
of
our
women
--
someway
I
had
a
queer
little
indescribable
*NL*
feeling
,
not
like
any
feeling
I
ever
had
before
when
``
women
''
were
*NL*
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
tell
us
how
it
came
about
?
''
Jeff
pursued
.
``
You
said
`
for
two
*NL*
thousand
years
'
--
did
you
have
men
here
before
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Zava
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
quiet
for
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
our
full
history
to
read
--
do
not
be
alarmed
--
it
has
*NL*
been
made
clear
and
short
.
It
took
us
a
long
time
to
learn
how
to
write
*NL*
history
.
Oh
,
how
I
should
love
to
read
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
with
flashing
eager
eyes
,
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
*NL*
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
so
wonderful
--
would
it
not
?
To
compare
the
history
of
two
*NL*
thousand
years
,
to
see
what
the
differences
are
--
between
us
,
who
are
*NL*
only
mothers
,
and
you
,
who
are
mothers
and
fathers
,
too
.
Of
course
we
*NL*
see
,
with
our
birds
,
that
the
father
is
as
useful
as
the
mother
,
almost
.
*NL*
But
among
insects
we
find
him
of
less
importance
,
sometimes
very
little
.
*NL*
Is
it
not
so
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
birds
and
bugs
,
''
Terry
said
,
``
but
not
among
animals
--
have
you
*NL*
NO
animals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
cats
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
father
is
not
very
useful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
no
cattle
--
sheep
--
horses
?
''
I
drew
some
rough
outlines
of
these
*NL*
beasts
and
showed
them
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
,
in
the
very
old
days
,
these
,
''
said
Somel
,
and
sketched
with
*NL*
swift
sure
touches
a
sort
of
sheep
or
llama
,
``
and
these
''
--
dogs
,
of
two
*NL*
or
three
kinds
,
``
that
that
''
--
pointing
to
my
absurd
but
recognizable
*NL*
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
became
of
them
?
''
asked
Jeff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
not
want
them
anymore
.
They
took
up
too
much
room
--
we
need
all
*NL*
our
land
to
feed
our
people
.
It
is
such
a
little
country
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
do
you
do
without
milk
?
''
Terry
demanded
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
MILK
?
We
have
milk
in
abundance
--
our
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
but
--
I
mean
for
cooking
--
for
grown
people
,
''
Terry
blundered
,
while
*NL*
they
looked
amazed
and
a
shade
displeased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
came
to
the
rescue
.
``
We
keep
cattle
for
their
milk
,
as
well
as
*NL*
for
their
meat
,
''
he
explained
.
``
Cow
's
milk
is
a
staple
article
of
diet
.
*NL*
There
is
a
great
milk
industry
--
to
collect
and
distribute
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
they
looked
puzzled
.
I
pointed
to
my
outline
of
a
cow
.
``
The
farmer
*NL*
milks
the
cow
,
''
I
said
,
and
sketched
a
milk
pail
,
the
stool
,
and
in
*NL*
pantomime
showed
the
man
milking
.
``
Then
it
is
carried
to
the
city
and
*NL*
distributed
by
milkmen
--
everybody
has
it
at
the
door
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
the
cow
no
child
?
''
asked
Somel
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
of
course
,
a
calf
,
that
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
milk
for
the
calf
and
you
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
some
time
to
make
clear
to
those
three
sweet-faced
women
the
*NL*
process
which
robs
the
cow
of
her
calf
,
and
the
calf
of
its
true
food
;
*NL*
and
the
talk
led
us
into
a
further
discussion
of
the
meat
business
.
They
*NL*
heard
it
out
,
looking
very
white
,
and
presently
begged
to
be
excused
.

CHAPTER
5
.
A
Unique
History
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
no
use
for
me
to
try
to
piece
out
this
account
with
adventures
.
*NL*
If
the
people
who
read
it
are
not
interested
in
these
amazing
women
and
*NL*
their
history
,
they
will
not
be
interested
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
us
--
three
young
men
to
a
whole
landful
of
women
--
what
could
we
*NL*
do
?
We
did
get
away
,
as
described
,
and
were
peacefully
brought
back
*NL*
again
without
,
as
Terry
complained
,
even
the
satisfaction
of
hitting
*NL*
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
adventures
because
there
was
nothing
to
fight
.
There
were
*NL*
no
wild
beasts
in
the
country
and
very
few
tame
ones
.
Of
these
I
might
*NL*
as
well
stop
to
describe
the
one
common
pet
of
the
country
.
Cats
,
of
*NL*
course
.
But
such
cats
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
do
you
suppose
these
Lady
Burbanks
had
done
with
their
cats
?
By
the
*NL*
most
prolonged
and
careful
selection
and
exclusion
they
had
developed
a
*NL*
race
of
cats
that
did
not
sing
!
That
's
a
fact
.
The
most
those
poor
dumb
*NL*
brutes
could
do
was
to
make
a
kind
of
squeak
when
they
were
hungry
or
*NL*
wanted
the
door
open
,
and
,
of
course
,
to
purr
,
and
make
the
various
*NL*
mother-noises
to
their
kittens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
they
had
ceased
to
kill
birds
.
They
were
rigorously
bred
to
*NL*
destroy
mice
and
moles
and
all
such
enemies
of
the
food
supply
;
but
the
*NL*
birds
were
numerous
and
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
were
discussing
birds
,
Terry
asked
them
if
they
used
feathers
*NL*
for
their
hats
,
and
they
seemed
amused
at
the
idea
.
He
made
a
few
*NL*
sketches
of
our
women
's
hats
,
with
plumes
and
quills
and
those
various
*NL*
tickling
things
that
stick
out
so
far
;
and
they
were
eagerly
interested
,
*NL*
as
at
everything
about
our
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
them
,
they
said
they
only
wore
hats
for
shade
when
working
in
the
*NL*
sun
;
and
those
were
big
light
straw
hats
,
something
like
those
used
in
*NL*
China
and
Japan
.
In
cold
weather
they
wore
caps
or
hoods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
decorative
purposes
--
do
n't
you
think
they
would
be
becoming
?
''
*NL*
pursued
Terry
,
making
as
pretty
a
picture
as
he
could
of
a
lady
with
a
*NL*
plumed
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
by
no
means
agreed
to
that
,
asking
quite
simply
if
the
men
wore
the
*NL*
same
kind
.
We
hastened
to
assure
her
that
they
did
not
--
drew
for
them
*NL*
our
kind
of
headgear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
no
men
wear
feathers
in
their
hats
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
Indians
,
''
Jeff
explained
.
``
Savages
,
you
know
.
''
And
he
sketched
a
*NL*
war
bonnet
to
show
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
soldiers
,
''
I
added
,
drawing
a
military
hat
with
plumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
never
expressed
horror
or
disapproval
,
nor
indeed
much
*NL*
surprise
--
just
a
keen
interest
.
And
the
notes
they
made
!
--
miles
of
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
our
pussycats
.
We
were
a
good
deal
impressed
by
this
*NL*
achievement
in
breeding
,
and
when
they
questioned
us
--
I
can
tell
you
we
*NL*
were
well
pumped
for
information
--
we
told
of
what
had
been
done
for
dogs
*NL*
and
horses
and
cattle
,
but
that
there
was
no
effort
applied
to
cats
,
*NL*
except
for
show
purposes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
I
could
represent
the
kind
,
quiet
,
steady
,
ingenious
way
they
*NL*
questioned
us
.
It
was
not
just
curiosity
--
they
were
n't
a
bit
more
*NL*
curious
about
us
than
we
were
about
them
,
if
as
much
.
But
they
were
*NL*
bent
on
understanding
our
kind
of
civilization
,
and
their
lines
of
*NL*
interrogation
would
gradually
surround
us
and
drive
us
in
till
we
found
*NL*
ourselves
up
against
some
admissions
we
did
not
want
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
all
these
breeds
of
dogs
you
have
made
useful
?
''
they
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
useful
!
Why
,
the
hunting
dogs
and
watchdogs
and
sheepdogs
are
*NL*
useful
--
and
sleddogs
of
course
!
--
and
ratters
,
I
suppose
,
but
we
do
n't
*NL*
keep
dogs
for
their
USEFULNESS
.
The
dog
is
`
the
friend
of
man
,
'
we
*NL*
say
--
we
love
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
they
understood
.
``
We
love
our
cats
that
way
.
They
surely
are
our
*NL*
friends
,
and
helpers
,
too
.
You
can
see
how
intelligent
and
affectionate
*NL*
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fact
.
I
'd
never
seen
such
cats
,
except
in
a
few
rare
instances
.
*NL*
Big
,
handsome
silky
things
,
friendly
with
everyone
and
devotedly
*NL*
attached
to
their
special
owners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
a
heartbreaking
time
drowning
kittens
,
''
we
suggested
.
But
*NL*
they
said
,
``
Oh
,
no
!
You
see
we
care
for
them
as
you
do
for
your
valuable
*NL*
cattle
.
The
fathers
are
few
compared
to
the
mothers
,
just
a
few
very
*NL*
fine
ones
in
each
town
;
they
live
quite
happily
in
walled
gardens
and
*NL*
the
houses
of
their
friends
.
But
they
only
have
a
mating
season
once
a
*NL*
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
hard
on
Thomas
,
is
n't
it
?
''
suggested
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
--
truly
!
You
see
,
it
is
many
centuries
that
we
have
been
breeding
*NL*
the
kind
of
cats
we
wanted
.
They
are
healthy
and
happy
and
friendly
,
as
*NL*
you
see
.
How
do
you
manage
with
your
dogs
?
Do
you
keep
them
in
pairs
,
or
*NL*
segregate
the
fathers
,
or
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
explained
that
--
well
,
that
it
was
n't
a
question
of
fathers
*NL*
exactly
;
that
nobody
wanted
a
--
a
mother
dog
;
that
,
well
,
that
*NL*
practically
all
our
dogs
were
males
--
there
was
only
a
very
small
*NL*
percentage
of
females
allowed
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Zava
,
observing
Terry
with
her
grave
sweet
smile
,
quoted
back
at
*NL*
him
:
``
Rather
hard
on
Thomas
,
is
n't
it
?
Do
they
enjoy
it
--
living
without
*NL*
mates
?
Are
your
dogs
as
uniformly
healthy
and
sweet-tempered
as
our
*NL*
cats
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
laughed
,
eyeing
Terry
mischievously
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
we
began
*NL*
to
feel
Jeff
something
of
a
traitor
--
he
so
often
flopped
over
and
took
*NL*
their
side
of
things
;
also
his
medical
knowledge
gave
him
a
different
*NL*
point
of
view
somehow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
to
admit
,
''
he
told
them
,
``
that
the
dog
,
with
us
,
is
the
most
*NL*
diseased
of
any
animal
--
next
to
man
.
And
as
to
temper
--
there
are
always
*NL*
some
dogs
who
bite
people
--
especially
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
pure
malice
.
You
see
,
children
were
the
--
the
RAISON
D'ETRE
in
*NL*
this
country
.
All
our
interlocutors
sat
up
straight
at
once
.
They
were
*NL*
still
gentle
,
still
restrained
,
but
there
was
a
note
of
deep
amazement
*NL*
in
their
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
we
understand
that
you
keep
an
animal
--
an
unmated
male
animal
--
that
*NL*
bites
children
?
About
how
many
are
there
of
them
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thousands
--
in
a
large
city
,
''
said
Jeff
,
``
and
nearly
every
family
has
*NL*
one
in
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
broke
in
at
this
.
``
You
must
not
imagine
they
are
all
*NL*
dangerous
--
it
's
not
one
in
a
hundred
that
ever
bites
anybody
.
Why
,
they
*NL*
are
the
best
friends
of
the
children
--
a
boy
does
n't
have
half
a
chance
*NL*
that
has
n't
a
dog
to
play
with
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
girls
?
''
asked
Somel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
girls
--
why
they
like
them
too
,
''
he
said
,
but
his
voice
flatted
a
*NL*
little
.
They
always
noticed
little
things
like
that
,
we
found
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
they
wrung
from
us
the
fact
that
the
friend
of
man
,
*NL*
in
the
city
,
was
a
prisoner
;
was
taken
out
for
his
meager
exercise
on
*NL*
a
leash
;
was
liable
not
only
to
many
diseases
but
to
the
one
destroying
*NL*
horror
of
rabies
;
and
,
in
many
cases
,
for
the
safety
of
the
citizens
,
*NL*
had
to
go
muzzled
.
Jeff
maliciously
added
vivid
instances
he
had
known
*NL*
or
read
of
injury
and
death
from
mad
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
scold
or
fuss
about
it
.
Calm
as
judges
,
those
women
were
.
*NL*
But
they
made
notes
;
Moadine
read
them
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
tell
me
if
I
have
the
facts
correct
,
''
she
said
.
``
In
your
*NL*
country
--
and
in
others
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
we
admitted
,
``
in
most
civilized
countries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In

civilized

a

of

``
They
are
a
protection

Terry
insisted
.

bark
if
burglars
try
to
*NL*
get
in

Then
she
made
notes
of
``
burglars
''
and
went
on
:
``
because
of
the
love
*NL*
which
people
bear
to
this
animal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zava
interrupted
here
.
``
Is
it
the
men
or
the
women
who
love
this
animal
*NL*
so
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
!
''
insisted
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Equally
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jeff
said
,
``
Nonsense
,
Terry
--
you
know
men
like
dogs
better
than
*NL*
women
do
--
as
a
whole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
they
love
it
so
much
--
especially
men
.
This
animal
is
kept
shut
*NL*
up
,
or
chained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
suddenly
asked
Somel
.
``
We
keep
our
father
cats
shut
up
because
*NL*
we
do
not
want
too
much
fathering
;
but
they
are
not
chained
--
they
have
*NL*
large
grounds
to
run
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
valuable
dog
would
be
stolen
if
he
was
let
loose
,
''
I
said
.
``
We
put
*NL*
collars
on
them
,
with
the
owner
's
name
,
in
case
they
do
stray
.
Besides
,
*NL*
they
get
into
fights
--
a
valuable
dog
might
easily
be
killed
by
a
bigger
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
she
said
.
``
They
fight
when
they
meet
--
is
that
common
?
''
We
*NL*
admitted
that
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
kept
shut
up
,
or
chained
.
''
She
paused
again
,
and
asked
,
*NL*
``
Is
not
a
dog
fond
of
running
?
Are
they
not
built
for
speed
?
''
That
we
*NL*
admitted
,
too
,
and
Jeff
,
still
malicious
,
enlightened
them
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
always
thought
it
was
a
pathetic
sight
,
both
ways
--
to
see
a
man
or
*NL*
a
woman
taking
a
dog
to
walk
--
at
the
end
of
a
string
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
bred
them
to
be
as
neat
in
their
habits
as
cats
are
?
''
was
the
*NL*
next
question
.
And
when
Jeff
told
them
of
the
effect
of
dogs
on
sidewalk
*NL*
merchandise
and
the
streets
generally
,
they
found
it
hard
to
believe
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
their
country
was
as
neat
as
a
Dutch
kitchen
,
and
as
to
*NL*
sanitation
--
but
I
might
as
well
start
in
now
with
as
much
as
I
*NL*
can
remember
of
the
history
of
this
amazing
country
before
further
*NL*
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
'll
summarize
here
a
bit
as
to
our
opportunities
for
learning
it
.
*NL*
I
will
not
try
to
repeat
the
careful
,
detailed
account
I
lost
;
I
'll
just
*NL*
say
that
we
were
kept
in
that
fortress
a
good
six
months
all
told
,
and
*NL*
after
that
,
three
in
a
pleasant
enough
city
where
--
to
Terry
's
infinite
*NL*
disgust
--
there
were
only
``
Colonels
''
and
little
children
--
no
young
women
*NL*
whatever
.
Then
we
were
under
surveillance
for
three
more
--
always
with
a
*NL*
tutor
or
a
guard
or
both
.
But
those
months
were
pleasant
because
we
were
*NL*
really
getting
acquainted
with
the
girls
.
That
was
a
chapter
!
--
or
will
*NL*
be
--
I
will
try
to
do
justice
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
learned
their
language
pretty
thoroughly
--
had
to
;
and
they
learned
*NL*
ours
much
more
quickly
and
used
it
to
hasten
our
own
studies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
,
who
was
never
without
reading
matter
of
some
sort
,
had
two
little
*NL*
books
with
him
,
a
novel
and
a
little
anthology
of
verse
;
and
I
had
one
*NL*
of
those
pocket
encyclopedias
--
a
fat
little
thing
,
bursting
with
facts
.
*NL*
These
were
used
in
our
education
--
and
theirs
.
Then
as
soon
as
we
were
up
*NL*
to
it
,
they
furnished
us
with
plenty
of
their
own
books
,
and
I
went
in
*NL*
for
the
history
part
--
I
wanted
to
understand
the
genesis
of
this
miracle
*NL*
of
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
is
what
happened
,
according
to
their
records
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
geography
--
at
about
the
time
of
the
Christian
era
this
land
had
*NL*
a
free
passage
to
the
sea
.
I
'm
not
saying
where
,
for
good
reasons
.
But
*NL*
there
was
a
fairly
easy
pass
through
that
wall
of
mountains
behind
us
,
*NL*
and
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
these
people
were
of
Aryan
stock
,
*NL*
and
were
once
in
contact
with
the
best
civilization
of
the
old
world
.
*NL*
They
were
``
white
,
''
but
somewhat
darker
than
our
northern
races
because
*NL*
of
their
constant
exposure
to
sun
and
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
country
was
far
larger
then
,
including
much
land
beyond
the
pass
,
*NL*
and
a
strip
of
coast
.
They
had
ships
,
commerce
,
an
army
,
a
king
--
for
at
*NL*
that
time
they
were
what
they
so
calmly
called
us
--
a
bi-sexual
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
happened
to
them
first
was
merely
a
succession
of
historic
*NL*
misfortunes
such
as
have
befallen
other
nations
often
enough
.
They
*NL*
were
decimated
by
war
,
driven
up
from
their
coastline
till
finally
the
*NL*
reduced
population
,
with
many
of
the
men
killed
in
battle
,
occupied
this
*NL*
hinterland
,
and
defended
it
for
years
,
in
the
mountain
passes
.
Where
it
*NL*
was
open
to
any
possible
attack
from
below
they
strengthened
the
natural
*NL*
defenses
so
that
it
became
unscalably
secure
,
as
we
found
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
a
polygamous
people
,
and
a
slave-holding
people
,
like
all
of
*NL*
their
time
;
and
during
the
generation
or
two
of
this
struggle
to
defend
*NL*
their
mountain
home
they
built
the
fortresses
,
such
as
the
one
we
were
*NL*
held
in
,
and
other
of
their
oldest
buildings
,
some
still
in
use
.
Nothing
*NL*
but
earthquakes
could
destroy
such
architecture
--
huge
solid
blocks
,
*NL*
holding
by
their
own
weight
.
They
must
have
had
efficient
workmen
and
*NL*
enough
of
them
in
those
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
a
brave
fight
for
their
existence
,
but
no
nation
can
stand
*NL*
up
against
what
the
steamship
companies
call
``
an
act
of
God
.
''
While
*NL*
the
whole
fighting
force
was
doing
its
best
to
defend
their
mountain
*NL*
pathway
,
there
occurred
a
volcanic
outburst
,
with
some
local
tremors
,
*NL*
and
the
result
was
the
complete
filling
up
of
the
pass
--
their
only
*NL*
outlet
.
Instead
of
a
passage
,
a
new
ridge
,
sheer
and
high
,
stood
between
*NL*
them
and
the
sea
;
they
were
walled
in
,
and
beneath
that
wall
lay
their
*NL*
whole
little
army
.
Very
few
men
were
left
alive
,
save
the
slaves
;
*NL*
and
these
now
seized
their
opportunity
,
rose
in
revolt
,
killed
their
*NL*
remaining
masters
even
to
the
youngest
boy
,
killed
the
old
women
too
,
*NL*
and
the
mothers
,
intending
to
take
possession
of
the
country
with
the
*NL*
remaining
young
women
and
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
succession
of
misfortunes
was
too
much
for
those
infuriated
*NL*
virgins
.
There
were
many
of
them
,
and
but
few
of
these
would-be
masters
,
*NL*
so
the
young
women
,
instead
of
submitting
,
rose
in
sheer
desperation
and
*NL*
slew
their
brutal
conquerors
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sounds
like
Titus
Andronicus
,
I
know
,
but
that
is
their
account
.
I
*NL*
suppose
they
were
about
crazy
--
can
you
blame
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
literally
no
one
left
on
this
beautiful
high
garden
land
but
a
*NL*
bunch
of
hysterical
girls
and
some
older
slave
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
about
two
thousand
years
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
there
was
a
period
of
sheer
despair
.
The
mountains
towered
*NL*
between
them
and
their
old
enemies
,
but
also
between
them
and
escape
.
*NL*
There
was
no
way
up
or
down
or
out
--
they
simply
had
to
stay
there
.
Some
*NL*
were
for
suicide
,
but
not
the
majority
.
They
must
have
been
a
plucky
*NL*
lot
,
as
a
whole
,
and
they
decided
to
live
--
as
long
as
they
did
live
.
*NL*
Of
course
they
had
hope
,
as
youth
must
,
that
something
would
happen
to
*NL*
change
their
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
set
to
work
,
to
bury
the
dead
,
to
plow
and
sow
,
to
care
for
one
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Speaking
of
burying
the
dead
,
I
will
set
down
while
I
think
of
it
,
that
*NL*
they
had
adopted
cremation
in
about
the
thirteenth
century
,
for
the
same
*NL*
reason
that
they
had
left
off
raising
cattle
--
they
could
not
spare
*NL*
the
room
.
They
were
much
surprised
to
learn
that
we
were
still
*NL*
burying
--
asked
our
reasons
for
it
,
and
were
much
dissatisfied
with
what
*NL*
we
gave
.
We
told
them
of
the
belief
in
the
resurrection
of
the
body
,
and
*NL*
they
asked
if
our
God
was
not
as
well
able
to
resurrect
from
ashes
as
*NL*
from
long
corruption
.
We
told
them
of
how
people
thought
it
repugnant
to
*NL*
have
their
loved
ones
burn
,
and
they
asked
if
it
was
less
repugnant
to
*NL*
have
them
decay
.
They
were
inconveniently
reasonable
,
those
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
--
that
original
bunch
of
girls
set
to
work
to
clean
up
the
place
and
*NL*
make
their
living
as
best
they
could
.
Some
of
the
remaining
slave
women
*NL*
rendered
invaluable
service
,
teaching
such
trades
as
they
knew
.
They
*NL*
had
such
records
as
were
then
kept
,
all
the
tools
and
implements
of
the
*NL*
time
,
and
a
most
fertile
land
to
work
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
a
handful
of
the
younger
matrons
who
had
escaped
slaughter
,
*NL*
and
a
few
babies
were
born
after
the
cataclysm
--
but
only
two
boys
,
and
*NL*
they
both
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
five
or
ten
years
they
worked
together
,
growing
stronger
and
wiser
*NL*
and
more
and
more
mutually
attached
,
and
then
the
miracle
happened
--
one
*NL*
of
these
young
women
bore
a
child
.
Of
course
they
all
thought
there
must
*NL*
be
a
man
somewhere
,
but
none
was
found
.
Then
they
decided
it
must
be
a
*NL*
direct
gift
from
the
gods
,
and
placed
the
proud
mother
in
the
Temple
of
*NL*
Maaia
--
their
Goddess
of
Motherhood
--
under
strict
watch
.
And
there
,
*NL*
as
years
passed
,
this
wonder-woman
bore
child
after
child
,
five
of
*NL*
them
--
all
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
my
best
,
keenly
interested
as
I
have
always
been
in
sociology
and
*NL*
social
psychology
,
to
reconstruct
in
my
mind
the
real
position
of
these
*NL*
ancient
women
.
There
were
some
five
or
six
hundred
of
them
,
and
they
*NL*
were
harem-bred
;
yet
for
the
few
preceding
generations
they
had
been
*NL*
reared
in
the
atmosphere
of
such
heroic
struggle
that
the
stock
must
*NL*
have
been
toughened
somewhat
.
Left
alone
in
that
terrific
orphanhood
,
*NL*
they
had
clung
together
,
supporting
one
another
and
their
little
*NL*
sisters
,
and
developing
unknown
powers
in
the
stress
of
new
necessity
.
*NL*
To
this
pain-hardened
and
work-strengthened
group
,
who
had
lost
not
only
*NL*
the
love
and
care
of
parents
,
but
the
hope
of
ever
having
children
of
*NL*
their
own
,
there
now
dawned
the
new
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
at
last
was
Motherhood
,
and
though
it
was
not
for
all
of
them
*NL*
personally
,
it
might
--
if
the
power
was
inherited
--
found
here
a
new
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
imagined
how
those
five
Daughters
of
Maaia
,
Children
of
the
*NL*
Temple
,
Mothers
of
the
Future
--
they
had
all
the
titles
that
love
and
*NL*
hope
and
reverence
could
give
--
were
reared
.
The
whole
little
nation
*NL*
of
women
surrounded
them
with
loving
service
,
and
waited
,
between
a
*NL*
boundless
hope
and
an
equally
boundless
despair
,
to
see
if
they
,
too
,
*NL*
would
be
mothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
were
!
As
fast
as
they
reached
the
age
of
twenty-five
they
began
*NL*
bearing
.
Each
of
them
,
like
her
mother
,
bore
five
daughters
.
Presently
*NL*
there
were
twenty-five
New
Women
,
Mothers
in
their
own
right
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
spirit
of
the
country
changed
from
mourning
and
mere
courageous
*NL*
resignation
to
proud
joy
.
The
older
women
,
those
who
remembered
men
,
*NL*
died
off
;
the
youngest
of
all
the
first
lot
of
course
died
too
,
after
*NL*
a
while
,
and
by
that
time
there
were
left
one
hundred
and
fifty-five
*NL*
parthenogenetic
women
,
founding
a
new
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
inherited
all
that
the
devoted
care
of
that
declining
band
of
*NL*
original
ones
could
leave
them
.
Their
little
country
was
quite
safe
.
*NL*
Their
farms
and
gardens
were
all
in
full
production
.
Such
industries
*NL*
as
they
had
were
in
careful
order
.
The
records
of
their
past
were
all
*NL*
preserved
,
and
for
years
the
older
women
had
spent
their
time
in
the
*NL*
best
teaching
they
were
capable
of
,
that
they
might
leave
to
the
little
*NL*
group
of
sisters
and
mothers
all
they
possessed
of
skill
and
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
you
have
the
start
of
Herland
!
One
family
,
all
descended
from
one
*NL*
mother
!
She
lived
to
a
hundred
years
old
;
lived
to
see
her
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty-five
great-granddaughters
born
;
lived
as
Queen-Priestess-Mother
*NL*
of
them
all
;
and
died
with
a
nobler
pride
and
a
fuller
joy
than
perhaps
*NL*
any
human
soul
has
ever
known
--
she
alone
had
founded
a
new
race
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
five
daughters
had
grown
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
holy
calm
,
*NL*
of
awed
watchful
waiting
,
of
breathless
prayer
.
To
them
the
longed-for
*NL*
motherhood
was
not
only
a
personal
joy
,
but
a
nation
's
hope
.
Their
*NL*
twenty-five
daughters
in
turn
,
with
a
stronger
hope
,
a
richer
,
wider
*NL*
outlook
,
with
the
devoted
love
and
care
of
all
the
surviving
population
,
*NL*
grew
up
as
a
holy
sisterhood
,
their
whole
ardent
youth
looking
*NL*
forward
to
their
great
office
.
And
at
last
they
were
left
alone
;
the
*NL*
white-haired
First
Mother
was
gone
,
and
this
one
family
,
five
sisters
,
*NL*
twenty-five
first
cousins
,
and
a
hundred
and
twenty-five
second
cousins
,
*NL*
began
a
new
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
you
have
human
beings
,
unquestionably
,
but
what
we
were
slow
in
*NL*
understanding
was
how
these
ultra-women
,
inheriting
only
from
women
,
had
*NL*
eliminated
not
only
certain
masculine
characteristics
,
which
of
*NL*
course
we
did
not
look
for
,
but
so
much
of
what
we
had
always
thought
*NL*
essentially
feminine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tradition
of
men
as
guardians
and
protectors
had
quite
died
out
.
*NL*
These
stalwart
virgins
had
no
men
to
fear
and
therefore
no
need
of
*NL*
protection
.
As
to
wild
beasts
--
there
were
none
in
their
sheltered
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
power
of
mother-love
,
that
maternal
instinct
we
so
highly
laud
,
was
*NL*
theirs
of
course
,
raised
to
its
highest
power
;
and
a
sister-love
which
,
*NL*
even
while
recognizing
the
actual
relationship
,
we
found
it
hard
to
*NL*
credit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
,
incredulous
,
even
contemptuous
,
when
we
were
alone
,
refused
to
*NL*
believe
the
story
.
``
A
lot
of
traditions
as
old
as
Herodotus
--
and
*NL*
about
as
trustworthy
!
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
likely
women
--
just
a
pack
of
*NL*
women
--
would
have
hung
together
like
that
!
We
all
know
women
ca
n't
*NL*
organize
--
that
they
scrap
like
anything
--
are
frightfully
jealous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
these
New
Ladies
did
n't
have
anyone
to
be
jealous
of
,
remember
,
''
*NL*
drawled
Jeff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
likely
story
,
''
Terry
sneered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
invent
a
likelier
one
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
Here
ARE
the
*NL*
women
--
nothing
but
women
,
and
you
yourself
admit
there
's
no
trace
of
a
*NL*
man
in
the
country
.
''
This
was
after
we
had
been
about
a
good
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
admit
that
,
''
he
growled
.
``
And
it
's
a
big
miss
,
too
.
There
's
not
*NL*
only
no
fun
without
'em
--
no
real
sport
--
no
competition
;
but
these
women
*NL*
are
n't
WOMANLY
.
You
know
they
are
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
kind
of
talk
always
set
Jeff
going
;
and
I
gradually
grew
to
side
*NL*
with
him
.
``
Then
you
do
n't
call
a
breed
of
women
whose
one
concern
is
*NL*
motherhood
--
womanly
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
do
n't
,
''
snapped
Terry
.
``
What
does
a
man
care
for
*NL*
motherhood
--
when
he
has
n't
a
ghost
of
a
chance
at
fatherhood
?
And
*NL*
besides
--
what
's
the
good
of
talking
sentiment
when
we
are
just
men
*NL*
together
?
What
a
man
wants
of
women
is
a
good
deal
more
than
all
this
*NL*
`
motherhood
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
as
patient
as
possible
with
Terry
.
He
had
lived
about
nine
*NL*
months
among
the
``
Colonels
''
when
he
made
that
outburst
;
and
with
*NL*
no
chance
at
any
more
strenuous
excitement
than
our
gymnastics
gave
*NL*
us
--
save
for
our
escape
fiasco
.
I
do
n't
suppose
Terry
had
ever
lived
so
*NL*
long
with
neither
Love
,
Combat
,
nor
Danger
to
employ
his
superabundant
*NL*
energies
,
and
he
was
irritable
.
Neither
Jeff
nor
I
found
it
so
wearing
.
*NL*
I
was
so
much
interested
intellectually
that
our
confinement
did
not
*NL*
wear
on
me
;
and
as
for
Jeff
,
bless
his
heart
!
--
he
enjoyed
the
society
of
*NL*
that
tutor
of
his
almost
as
much
as
if
she
had
been
a
girl
--
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
but
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Terry
's
criticism
,
it
was
true
.
These
women
,
whose
essential
*NL*
distinction
of
motherhood
was
the
dominant
note
of
their
whole
culture
,
*NL*
were
strikingly
deficient
in
what
we
call
``
femininity
.
''
This
led
me
very
*NL*
promptly
to
the
conviction
that
those
``
feminine
charms
''
we
are
so
fond
*NL*
of
are
not
feminine
at
all
,
but
mere
reflected
masculinity
--
developed
to
*NL*
please
us
because
they
had
to
please
us
,
and
in
no
way
essential
to
*NL*
the
real
fulfillment
of
their
great
process
.
But
Terry
came
to
no
such
*NL*
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
you
wait
till
I
get
out
!
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
both
cautioned
him
.
``
Look
here
,
Terry
,
my
boy
!
You
be
careful
!
*NL*
They
've
been
mighty
good
to
us
--
but
do
you
remember
the
anesthesia
?
If
*NL*
you
do
any
mischief
in
this
virgin
land
,
beware
of
the
vengeance
of
the
*NL*
Maiden
Aunts
!
Come
,
be
a
man
!
It
wo
n't
be
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
return
to
the
history
:
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
at
once
to
plan
and
built
for
their
children
,
all
the
*NL*
strength
and
intelligence
of
the
whole
of
them
devoted
to
that
one
*NL*
thing
.
Each
girl
,
of
course
,
was
reared
in
full
knowledge
of
her
*NL*
Crowning
Office
,
and
they
had
,
even
then
,
very
high
ideas
of
the
molding
*NL*
powers
of
the
mother
,
as
well
as
those
of
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
high
ideals
as
they
had
!
Beauty
,
Health
,
Strength
,
Intellect
,
*NL*
Goodness
--
for
those
they
prayed
and
worked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
no
enemies
;
they
themselves
were
all
sisters
and
friends
.
The
*NL*
land
was
fair
before
them
,
and
a
great
future
began
to
form
itself
in
*NL*
their
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
religion
they
had
to
begin
with
was
much
like
that
of
old
Greece
--
a
*NL*
number
of
gods
and
goddesses
;
but
they
lost
all
interest
in
deities
*NL*
of
war
and
plunder
,
and
gradually
centered
on
their
Mother
Goddess
*NL*
altogether
.
Then
,
as
they
grew
more
intelligent
,
this
had
turned
into
a
*NL*
sort
of
Maternal
Pantheism
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
Mother
Earth
,
bearing
fruit
.
All
that
they
ate
was
fruit
of
*NL*
motherhood
,
from
seed
or
egg
or
their
product
.
By
motherhood
they
were
*NL*
born
and
by
motherhood
they
lived
--
life
was
,
to
them
,
just
the
long
*NL*
cycle
of
motherhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
very
early
they
recognized
the
need
of
improvement
as
well
as
*NL*
of
mere
repetition
,
and
devoted
their
combined
intelligence
to
that
*NL*
problem
--
how
to
make
the
best
kind
of
people
.
First
this
was
merely
the
*NL*
hope
of
bearing
better
ones
,
and
then
they
recognized
that
however
*NL*
the
children
differed
at
birth
,
the
real
growth
lay
later
--
through
*NL*
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
things
began
to
hum
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
learned
more
and
more
to
appreciate
what
these
women
had
*NL*
accomplished
,
the
less
proud
I
was
of
what
we
,
with
all
our
manhood
,
had
*NL*
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
they
had
had
no
wars
.
They
had
had
no
kings
,
and
no
priests
,
*NL*
and
no
aristocracies
.
They
were
sisters
,
and
as
they
grew
,
they
grew
*NL*
together
--
not
by
competition
,
but
by
united
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
tried
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
competition
,
and
they
were
keenly
*NL*
interested
.
Indeed
,
we
soon
found
from
their
earnest
questions
of
us
*NL*
that
they
were
prepared
to
believe
our
world
must
be
better
than
theirs
.
*NL*
They
were
not
sure
;
they
wanted
to
know
;
but
there
was
no
such
arrogance
*NL*
about
them
as
might
have
been
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
rather
spread
ourselves
,
telling
of
the
advantages
of
competition
:
*NL*
how
it
developed
fine
qualities
;
that
without
it
there
would
be
``
no
*NL*
stimulus
to
industry
.
''
Terry
was
very
strong
on
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
stimulus
to
industry
,
''
they
repeated
,
with
that
puzzled
look
we
had
*NL*
learned
to
know
so
well
.
``
STIMULUS
?
TO
INDUSTRY
?
But
do
n't
you
LIKE
to
*NL*
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
man
would
work
unless
he
had
to
,
''
Terry
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
MAN
!
You
mean
that
is
one
of
your
sex
distinctions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
!
''
he
said
hastily
.
``
No
one
,
I
mean
,
man
or
woman
,
would
work
*NL*
without
incentive
.
Competition
is
the
--
the
motor
power
,
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
with
us
,
''
they
explained
gently
,
``
so
it
is
hard
for
us
to
*NL*
understand
.
Do
you
mean
,
for
instance
,
that
with
you
no
mother
would
*NL*
work
for
her
children
without
the
stimulus
of
competition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
he
admitted
that
he
did
not
mean
that
.
Mothers
,
he
supposed
,
would
*NL*
of
course
work
for
their
children
in
the
home
;
but
the
world
's
work
*NL*
was
different
--
that
had
to
be
done
by
men
,
and
required
the
competitive
*NL*
element
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
our
teachers
were
eagerly
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
want
so
much
to
know
--
you
have
the
whole
world
to
tell
us
of
,
and
we
*NL*
have
only
our
little
land
!
And
there
are
two
of
you
--
the
two
sexes
--
to
*NL*
love
and
help
one
another
.
It
must
be
a
rich
and
wonderful
world
.
Tell
*NL*
us
--
what
is
the
work
of
the
world
,
that
men
do
--
which
we
have
not
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
everything
,
''
Terry
said
grandly
.
``
The
men
do
everything
,
with
us
.
''
*NL*
He
squared
his
broad
shoulders
and
lifted
his
chest
.
``
We
do
not
allow
*NL*
our
women
to
work
.
Women
are
loved
--
idolized
--
honored
--
kept
in
the
home
*NL*
to
care
for
the
children

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
`
the
home

?
''
asked
Somel
a
little
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Zava
begged
:
``
Tell
me
first
,
do
NO
women
work
,
really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
Terry
admitted
.
``
Some
have
to
,
of
the
poorer
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
how
many
--
in
your
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
seven

eight

Jeff

as
mischievous
as
ever

CHAPTER
6
.
Comparisons
Are
Odious
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
always
been
proud
of
my
country
,
of
course
.
Everyone
is
.
Compared
*NL*
with
the
other
lands
and
other
races
I
knew
,
the
United
States
of
*NL*
America
had
always
seemed
to
me
,
speaking
modestly
,
as
good
as
the
best
*NL*
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
as
a
clear-eyed
,
intelligent
,
perfectly
honest
,
and
*NL*
well-meaning
child
will
frequently
jar
one
's
self-esteem
by
innocent
*NL*
questions
,
so
did
these
women
,
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
*NL*
malice
or
satire
,
continually
bring
up
points
of
discussion
which
we
*NL*
spent
our
best
efforts
in
evading
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
we
were
fairly
proficient
in
their
language
,
had
read
a
lot
*NL*
about
their
history
,
and
had
given
them
the
general
outlines
of
ours
,
*NL*
they
were
able
to
press
their
questions
closer
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
when
Jeff
admitted
the
number
of
``
women
wage
earners
''
we
had
,
they
*NL*
instantly
asked
for
the
total
population
,
for
the
proportion
of
adult
*NL*
women
,
and
found
that
there
were
but
twenty
million
or
so
at
the
*NL*
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
at
least
a
third
of
your
women
are
--
what
is
it
you
call
them
--
wage
*NL*
earners
?
And
they
are
all
POOR
.
What
is
POOR
,
exactly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ours
is
the
best
country
in
the
world
as
to
poverty
,
''
Terry
told
them
.
*NL*
``
We
do
not
have
the
wretched
paupers
and
beggars
of
the
older
countries
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
.
Why
,
European
visitors
tell
us
,
we
do
n't
know
what
poverty
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
do
we
,
''
answered
Zava
.
``
Wo
n't
you
tell
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
put
it
up
to
me
,
saying
I
was
the
sociologist
,
and
I
explained
*NL*
that
the
laws
of
nature
require
a
struggle
for
existence
,
and
that
in
*NL*
the
struggle
the
fittest
survive
,
and
the
unfit
perish
.
In
our
economic
*NL*
struggle
,
I
continued
,
there
was
always
plenty
of
opportunity
for
the
*NL*
fittest
to
reach
the
top
,
which
they
did
,
in
great
numbers
,
particularly
*NL*
in
our
country
;
that
where
there
was
severe
economic
pressure
the
lowest
*NL*
classes
of
course
felt
it
the
worst
,
and
that
among
the
poorest
of
all
*NL*
the
women
were
driven
into
the
labor
market
by
necessity
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
listened
closely
,
with
the
usual
note-taking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
one-third
,
then
,
belong
to
the
poorest
class
,
''
observed
Moadine
*NL*
gravely
.
``
And
two-thirds
are
the
ones
who
are
--
how
was
it
you
so
*NL*
beautifully
put
it
?
--
`
loved
,
honored
,
kept
in
the
home
to
care
for
the
*NL*
children
.
'
This
inferior
one-third
have
no
children
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
--
he
was
getting
as
bad
as
they
were
--
solemnly
replied
that
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
the
poorer
they
were
,
the
more
children
they
had
.
That
too
,
he
*NL*
explained
,
was
a
law
of
nature
:
``
Reproduction
is
in
inverse
proportion
*NL*
to
individuation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
`
laws
of
nature
,
'
''
Zava
gently
asked
,
``
are
they
all
the
laws
you
*NL*
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
not
!
''
protested
Terry
.
``
We
have
systems
of
law
that
go
*NL*
back
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
--
just
as
you
do
,
no
doubt
,
''
he
*NL*
finished
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
Moadine
told
him
.
``
We
have
no
laws
over
a
hundred
years
old
,
*NL*
and
most
of
them
are
under
twenty
.
In
a
few
weeks
more
,
''
she
continued
,
*NL*
``
we
are
going
to
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
over
our
little
land
*NL*
and
explaining
everything
you
care
to
know
about
.
We
want
you
to
see
our
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
assure
you
,
''
Somel
added
,
``
that
our
people
want
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
brightened
up
immensely
at
this
news
,
and
reconciled
himself
to
*NL*
the
renewed
demands
upon
our
capacity
as
teachers
.
It
was
lucky
that
we
*NL*
knew
so
little
,
really
,
and
had
no
books
to
refer
to
,
else
,
I
fancy
we
*NL*
might
all
be
there
yet
,
teaching
those
eager-minded
women
about
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
geography
,
they
had
the
tradition
of
the
Great
Sea
,
beyond
the
*NL*
mountains
;
and
they
could
see
for
themselves
the
endless
thick-forested
*NL*
plains
below
them
--
that
was
all
.
But
from
the
few
records
of
their
*NL*
ancient
condition
--
not
``
before
the
flood
''
with
them
,
but
before
that
*NL*
mighty
quake
which
had
cut
them
off
so
completely
--
they
were
aware
that
*NL*
there
were
other
peoples
and
other
countries
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
geology
they
were
quite
ignorant
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
anthropology
,
they
had
those
same
remnants
of
information
about
*NL*
other
peoples
,
and
the
knowledge
of
the
savagery
of
the
occupants
of
*NL*
those
dim
forests
below
.
Nevertheless
,
they
had
inferred
-LRB-
marvelously
*NL*
keen
on
inference
and
deduction
their
minds
were
!
-RRB-
the
existence
and
*NL*
development
of
civilization
in
other
places
,
much
as
we
infer
it
on
*NL*
other
planets
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
our
biplane
came
whirring
over
their
heads
in
that
first
scouting
*NL*
flight
of
ours
,
they
had
instantly
accepted
it
as
proof
of
the
high
*NL*
development
of
Some
Where
Else
,
and
had
prepared
to
receive
us
as
*NL*
cautiously
and
eagerly
as
we
might
prepare
to
welcome
visitors
who
came
*NL*
``
by
meteor
''
from
Mars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
history
--
outside
their
own
--
they
knew
nothing
,
of
course
,
save
for
*NL*
their
ancient
traditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
astronomy
they
had
a
fair
working
knowledge
--
that
is
a
very
old
*NL*
science
;
and
with
it
,
a
surprising
range
and
facility
in
mathematics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Physiology
they
were
quite
familiar
with
.
Indeed
,
when
it
came
to
the
*NL*
simpler
and
more
concrete
sciences
,
wherein
the
subject
matter
was
at
*NL*
hand
and
they
had
but
to
exercise
their
minds
upon
it
,
the
results
were
*NL*
surprising
.
They
had
worked
out
a
chemistry
,
a
botany
,
a
physics
,
*NL*
with
all
the
blends
where
a
science
touches
an
art
,
or
merges
into
*NL*
an
industry
,
to
such
fullness
of
knowledge
as
made
us
feel
like
*NL*
schoolchildren
.
*NL*
*NL*
Also
we
found
this
out
--
as
soon
as
we
were
free
of
the
country
,
and
*NL*
by
further
study
and
question
--
that
what
one
knew
,
all
knew
,
to
a
very
*NL*
considerable
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
talked
later
with
little
mountain
girls
from
the
fir-dark
valleys
*NL*
away
up
at
their
highest
part
,
and
with
sunburned
plains-women
and
agile
*NL*
foresters
,
all
over
the
country
,
as
well
as
those
in
the
towns
,
and
*NL*
everywhere
there
was
the
same
high
level
of
intelligence
.
Some
knew
far
*NL*
more
than
others
about
one
thing
--
they
were
specialized
,
of
course
;
but
*NL*
all
of
them
knew
more
about
everything
--
that
is
,
about
everything
the
*NL*
country
was
acquainted
with
--
than
is
the
case
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
boast
a
good
deal
of
our
``
high
level
of
general
intelligence
''
and
our
*NL*
``
compulsory
public
education
,
''
but
in
proportion
to
their
opportunities
*NL*
they
were
far
better
educated
than
our
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
what
we
told
them
,
from
what
sketches
and
models
we
were
able
to
*NL*
prepare
,
they
constructed
a
sort
of
working
outline
to
fill
in
as
they
*NL*
learned
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
big
globe
was
made
,
and
our
uncertain
maps
,
helped
out
by
those
in
*NL*
that
precious
yearbook
thing
I
had
,
were
tentatively
indicated
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
in
eager
groups
,
masses
of
them
who
came
for
the
purpose
,
and
*NL*
listened
while
Jeff
roughly
ran
over
the
geologic
history
of
the
earth
,
*NL*
and
showed
them
their
own
land
in
relation
to
the
others
.
Out
of
that
*NL*
same
pocket
reference
book
of
mine
came
facts
and
figures
which
were
*NL*
seized
upon
and
placed
in
right
relation
with
unerring
acumen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Terry
grew
interested
in
this
work
.
``
If
we
can
keep
this
up
,
*NL*
they
'll
be
having
us
lecture
to
all
the
girls
'
schools
and
colleges
--
how
*NL*
about
that
?
''
he
suggested
to
us
.
``
Do
n't
know
as
I
'd
object
to
being
an
*NL*
Authority
to
such
audiences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
,
in
fact
,
urge
us
to
give
public
lectures
later
,
but
not
to
the
*NL*
hearers
or
with
the
purpose
we
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
they
were
doing
with
us
was
like
--
like
--
well
,
say
like
Napoleon
*NL*
extracting
military
information
from
a
few
illiterate
peasants
.
They
*NL*
knew
just
what
to
ask
,
and
just
what
use
to
make
of
it
;
they
had
*NL*
mechanical
appliances
for
disseminating
information
almost
equal
to
ours
*NL*
at
home
;
and
by
the
time
we
were
led
forth
to
lecture
,
our
audiences
*NL*
had
thoroughly
mastered
a
well-arranged
digest
of
all
we
had
previously
*NL*
given
to
our
teachers
,
and
were
prepared
with
such
notes
and
questions
*NL*
as
might
have
intimidated
a
university
professor
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
audiences
of
girls
,
either
.
It
was
some
time
before
we
*NL*
were
allowed
to
meet
the
young
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mind
telling
what
you
intend
to
do
with
us
?
''
Terry
burst
*NL*
forth
one
day
,
facing
the
calm
and
friendly
Moadine
with
that
funny
*NL*
half-blustering
air
of
his
.
At
first
he
used
to
storm
and
flourish
quite
*NL*
a
good
deal
,
but
nothing
seemed
to
amuse
them
more
;
they
would
gather
*NL*
around
and
watch
him
as
if
it
was
an
exhibition
,
politely
,
but
with
*NL*
evident
interest
.
So
he
learned
to
check
himself
,
and
was
almost
*NL*
reasonable
in
his
bearing
--
but
not
quite
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
announced
smoothly
and
evenly
:
``
Not
in
the
least
.
I
thought
it
was
*NL*
quite
plain
.
We
are
trying
to
learn
of
you
all
we
can
,
and
to
teach
you
*NL*
what
you
are
willing
to
learn
of
our
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
he
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
a
quiet
enigmatic
smile
.
``
That
depends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Depends
on
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mainly
on
yourselves
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
keep
us
shut
up
so
closely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
we
do
not
feel
quite
safe
in
allowing
you
at
large
where
there
*NL*
are
so
many
young
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
really
pleased
at
that
.
He
had
thought
as
much
,
inwardly
;
but
*NL*
he
pushed
the
question
.
``
Why
should
you
be
afraid
?
We
are
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
that
little
smile
again
,
and
asked
:
``
Are
`
gentlemen
'
always
*NL*
safe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
surely
do
not
think
that
any
of
us
,
''
he
said
it
with
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
emphasis
on
the
``
us
,
''
``
would
hurt
your
young
girls
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
she
said
quickly
,
in
real
surprise
.
``
The
danger
is
quite
the
*NL*
other
way
.
They
might
hurt
you
.
If
,
by
any
accident
,
you
did
harm
any
*NL*
one
of
us
,
you
would
have
to
face
a
million
mothers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
so
amazed
and
outraged
that
Jeff
and
I
laughed
outright
,
but
*NL*
she
went
on
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
you
quite
understand
yet
.
You
are
but
men
,
three
men
,
*NL*
in
a
country
where
the
whole
population
are
mothers
--
or
are
going
to
be
.
*NL*
Motherhood
means
to
us
something
which
I
can
not
yet
discover
in
any
*NL*
of
the
countries
of
which
you
tell
us
.
You
have
spoken
''
--
she
turned
to
*NL*
Jeff
,
``
of
Human
Brotherhood
as
a
great
idea
among
you
,
but
even
that
I
*NL*
judge
is
far
from
a
practical
expression
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
nodded
rather
sadly
.
``
Very
far
--
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
have
Human
Motherhood
--
in
full
working
use
,
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
else
except
the
literal
sisterhood
of
our
origin
,
and
the
far
*NL*
higher
and
deeper
union
of
our
social
growth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
children
in
this
country
are
the
one
center
and
focus
of
all
our
*NL*
thoughts
.
Every
step
of
our
advance
is
always
considered
in
its
effect
*NL*
on
them
--
on
the
race
.
You
see
,
we
are
MOTHERS
,
''
she
repeated
,
as
if
in
*NL*
that
she
had
said
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
how
that
fact
--
which
is
shared
by
all
women
--
constitutes
*NL*
any
risk
to
us
,
''
Terry
persisted
.
``
You
mean
they
would
defend
their
*NL*
children
from
attack
.
Of
course
.
Any
mothers
would
.
But
we
are
not
*NL*
savages
,
my
dear
lady
;
we
are
not
going
to
hurt
any
mother
's
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
one
another
and
shook
their
heads
a
little
,
but
*NL*
Zava
turned
to
Jeff
and
urged
him
to
make
us
see
--
said
he
seemed
to
*NL*
understand
more
fully
than
we
did
.
And
he
tried
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
see
it
now
,
or
at
least
much
more
of
it
,
but
it
has
taken
me
a
*NL*
long
time
,
and
a
good
deal
of
honest
intellectual
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
they
call
Motherhood
was
like
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
with
a
really
high
degree
of
social
development
,
something
*NL*
like
that
of
Ancient
Egypt
or
Greece
.
Then
they
suffered
the
loss
of
*NL*
everything
masculine
,
and
supposed
at
first
that
all
human
power
and
*NL*
safety
had
gone
too
.
Then
they
developed
this
virgin
birth
capacity
.
*NL*
Then
,
since
the
prosperity
of
their
children
depended
on
it
,
the
fullest
*NL*
and
subtlest
coordination
began
to
be
practiced
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
how
long
Terry
balked
at
the
evident
unanimity
of
these
*NL*
women
--
the
most
conspicuous
feature
of
their
whole
culture
.
``
It
's
*NL*
impossible
!
''
he
would
insist
.
``
Women
can
not
cooperate
--
it
's
against
*NL*
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
urged
the
obvious
facts
he
would
say
:
``
Fiddlesticks
!
''
or
``
Hang
*NL*
your
facts
--
I
tell
you
it
ca
n't
be
done
!
''
And
we
never
succeeded
in
*NL*
shutting
him
up
till
Jeff
dragged
in
the
hymenoptera
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Go
to
the
ant
,
thou
sluggard
'
--
and
learn
something
,
''
he
said
*NL*
triumphantly
.
``
Do
n't
they
cooperate
pretty
well
?
You
ca
n't
beat
it
.
This
*NL*
place
is
just
like
an
enormous
anthill
--
you
know
an
anthill
is
nothing
*NL*
but
a
nursery
.
And
how
about
bees
?
Do
n't
they
manage
to
cooperate
and
*NL*
love
one
another
?
as
that
precious
Constable
had
it
.
Just
show
me
a
*NL*
combination
of
male
creatures
,
bird
,
bug
,
or
beast
,
that
works
as
well
,
*NL*
will
you
?
Or
one
of
our
masculine
countries
where
the
people
work
*NL*
together
as
well
as
they
do
here
!
I
tell
you
,
women
are
the
natural
*NL*
cooperators
,
not
men
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
had
to
learn
a
good
many
things
he
did
not
want
to
.
To
go
back
to
*NL*
my
little
analysis
of
what
happened
:
*NL*
*NL*
They
developed
all
this
close
inter-service
in
the
interests
of
their
*NL*
children
.
To
do
the
best
work
they
had
to
specialize
,
of
course
;
the
*NL*
children
needed
spinners
and
weavers
,
farmers
and
gardeners
,
carpenters
*NL*
and
masons
,
as
well
as
mothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
filling
up
of
the
place
.
When
a
population
multiplies
*NL*
by
five
every
thirty
years
it
soon
reaches
the
limits
of
a
country
,
*NL*
especially
a
small
one
like
this
.
They
very
soon
eliminated
all
the
*NL*
grazing
cattle
--
sheep
were
the
last
to
go
,
I
believe
.
Also
,
they
worked
*NL*
out
a
system
of
intensive
agriculture
surpassing
anything
I
ever
heard
*NL*
of
,
with
the
very
forests
all
reset
with
fruit
-
or
nut-bearing
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
what
they
would
,
however
,
there
soon
came
a
time
when
they
were
*NL*
confronted
with
the
problem
of
``
the
pressure
of
population
''
in
an
acute
*NL*
form
.
There
was
really
crowding
,
and
with
it
,
unavoidably
,
a
decline
in
*NL*
standards
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
how
did
those
women
meet
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Not
by
a
``
struggle
for
existence
''
which
would
result
in
an
everlasting
*NL*
writhing
mass
of
underbred
people
trying
to
get
ahead
of
one
*NL*
another
--
some
few
on
top
,
temporarily
,
many
constantly
crushed
out
*NL*
underneath
,
a
hopeless
substratum
of
paupers
and
degenerates
,
and
no
*NL*
serenity
or
peace
for
anyone
,
no
possibility
for
really
noble
qualities
*NL*
among
the
people
at
large
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
did
they
start
off
on
predatory
excursions
to
get
more
land
from
*NL*
somebody
else
,
or
to
get
more
food
from
somebody
else
,
to
maintain
their
*NL*
struggling
mass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
at
all
.
They
sat
down
in
council
together
and
thought
it
out
.
Very
*NL*
clear
,
strong
thinkers
they
were
.
They
said
:
``
With
our
best
endeavors
*NL*
this
country
will
support
about
so
many
people
,
with
the
standard
of
*NL*
peace
,
comfort
,
health
,
beauty
,
and
progress
we
demand
.
Very
well
.
That
*NL*
is
all
the
people
we
will
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
you
have
it
.
You
see
,
they
were
Mothers
,
not
in
our
sense
of
*NL*
helpless
involuntary
fecundity
,
forced
to
fill
and
overfill
the
land
,
*NL*
every
land
,
and
then
see
their
children
suffer
,
sin
,
and
die
,
fighting
*NL*
horribly
with
one
another
;
but
in
the
sense
of
Conscious
Makers
*NL*
of
People
.
Mother-love
with
them
was
not
a
brute
passion
,
a
mere
*NL*
``
instinct
,
''
a
wholly
personal
feeling
;
it
was
--
a
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
included
that
limitless
feeling
of
sisterhood
,
that
wide
unity
in
*NL*
service
,
which
was
so
difficult
for
us
to
grasp
.
And
it
was
National
,
*NL*
Racial
,
Human
--
oh
,
I
do
n't
know
how
to
say
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
used
to
seeing
what
we
call
``
a
mother
''
completely
wrapped
up
in
*NL*
her
own
pink
bundle
of
fascinating
babyhood
,
and
taking
but
the
faintest
*NL*
theoretic
interest
in
anybody
else
's
bundle
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
*NL*
common
needs
of
ALL
the
bundles
.
But
these
women
were
working
all
*NL*
together
at
the
grandest
of
tasks
--
they
were
Making
People
--
and
they
*NL*
made
them
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
followed
a
period
of
``
negative
eugenics
''
which
must
have
been
an
*NL*
appalling
sacrifice
.
We
are
commonly
willing
to
``
lay
down
our
lives
''
for
*NL*
our
country
,
but
they
had
to
forego
motherhood
for
their
country
--
and
it
*NL*
was
precisely
the
hardest
thing
for
them
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
this
far
in
my
reading
I
went
to
Somel
for
more
light
.
We
*NL*
were
as
friendly
by
that
time
as
I
had
ever
been
in
my
life
with
any
*NL*
woman
.
A
mighty
comfortable
soul
she
was
,
giving
one
the
nice
smooth
*NL*
mother-feeling
a
man
likes
in
a
woman
,
and
yet
giving
also
the
clear
*NL*
intelligence
and
dependableness
I
used
to
assume
to
be
masculine
*NL*
qualities
.
We
had
talked
volumes
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
,
''
said
I.
``
Here
was
this
dreadful
period
when
they
got
far
too
*NL*
thick
,
and
decided
to
limit
the
population
.
We
have
a
lot
of
talk
about
*NL*
that
among
us
,
but
your
position
is
so
different
that
I
'd
like
to
know
a
*NL*
little
more
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
that
you
make
Motherhood
the
highest
social
service
--
a
*NL*
sacrament
,
really
;
that
it
is
only
undertaken
once
,
by
the
majority
of
*NL*
the
population
;
that
those
held
unfit
are
not
allowed
even
that
;
and
*NL*
that
to
be
encouraged
to
bear
more
than
one
child
is
the
very
highest
*NL*
reward
and
honor
in
the
power
of
the
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
She
interpolated
here
that
the
nearest
approach
to
an
aristocracy
*NL*
they
had
was
to
come
of
a
line
of
``
Over
Mothers
''
--
those
who
had
been
so
*NL*
honored
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
I
do
not
understand
,
naturally
,
is
how
you
prevent
it
.
I
*NL*
gathered
that
each
woman
had
five
.
You
have
no
tyrannical
husbands
to
*NL*
hold
in
check
--
and
you
surely
do
not
destroy
the
unborn
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
look
of
ghastly
horror
she
gave
me
I
shall
never
forget
.
She
started
*NL*
from
her
chair
,
pale
,
her
eyes
blazing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Destroy
the
unborn
--
!
''
she
said
in
a
hard
whisper
.
``
Do
men
do
that
in
*NL*
your
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
!
''
I
began
to
answer
,
rather
hotly
,
and
then
saw
the
gulf
before
*NL*
me
.
None
of
us
wanted
these
women
to
think
that
OUR
women
,
of
whom
we
*NL*
boasted
so
proudly
,
were
in
any
way
inferior
to
them
.
I
am
ashamed
*NL*
to
say
that
I
equivocated
.
I
told
her
of
certain
criminal
types
of
*NL*
women
--
perverts
,
or
crazy
,
who
had
been
known
to
commit
infanticide
.
I
*NL*
told
her
,
truly
enough
,
that
there
was
much
in
our
land
which
was
*NL*
open
to
criticism
,
but
that
I
hated
to
dwell
on
our
defects
until
they
*NL*
understood
us
and
our
conditions
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
making
a
wide
detour
,
I
scrambled
back
to
my
question
of
how
they
*NL*
limited
the
population
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Somel
,
she
seemed
sorry
,
a
little
ashamed
even
,
of
her
too
*NL*
clearly
expressed
amazement
.
As
I
look
back
now
,
knowing
them
better
,
I
*NL*
am
more
and
more
and
more
amazed
as
I
appreciate
the
exquisite
courtesy
*NL*
with
which
they
had
received
over
and
over
again
statements
and
*NL*
admissions
on
our
part
which
must
have
revolted
them
to
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
explained
to
me
,
with
sweet
seriousness
,
that
as
I
had
supposed
,
at
*NL*
first
each
woman
bore
five
children
;
and
that
,
in
their
eager
desire
*NL*
to
build
up
a
nation
,
they
had
gone
on
in
that
way
for
a
few
centuries
,
*NL*
till
they
were
confronted
with
the
absolute
need
of
a
limit
.
This
fact
*NL*
was
equally
plain
to
all
--
all
were
equally
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
now
as
anxious
to
check
their
wonderful
power
as
they
had
*NL*
been
to
develop
it
;
and
for
some
generations
gave
the
matter
their
most
*NL*
earnest
thought
and
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
living
on
rations
before
we
worked
it
out
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
we
*NL*
did
work
it
out
.
You
see
,
before
a
child
comes
to
one
of
us
there
is
a
*NL*
period
of
utter
exaltation
--
the
whole
being
is
uplifted
and
filled
with
*NL*
a
concentrated
desire
for
that
child
.
We
learned
to
look
forward
to
that
*NL*
period
with
the
greatest
caution
.
Often
our
young
women
,
those
to
whom
*NL*
motherhood
had
not
yet
come
,
would
voluntarily
defer
it
.
When
that
deep
*NL*
inner
demand
for
a
child
began
to
be
felt
she
would
deliberately
engage
*NL*
in
the
most
active
work
,
physical
and
mental
;
and
even
more
important
,
*NL*
would
solace
her
longing
by
the
direct
care
and
service
of
the
babies
we
*NL*
already
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
.
Her
wise
sweet
face
grew
deeply
,
reverently
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
soon
grew
to
see
that
mother-love
has
more
than
one
channel
of
*NL*
expression
.
I
think
the
reason
our
children
are
so
--
so
fully
loved
,
by
*NL*
all
of
us
,
is
that
we
never
--
any
of
us
--
have
enough
of
our
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
to
me
infinitely
pathetic
,
and
I
said
so
.
``
We
have
much
that
*NL*
is
bitter
and
hard
in
our
life
at
home
,
''
I
told
her
,
``
but
this
seems
to
*NL*
me
piteous
beyond
words
--
a
whole
nation
of
starving
mothers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
smiled
her
deep
contented
smile
,
and
said
I
quite
misunderstood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
each
go
without
a
certain
range
of
personal
joy
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
*NL*
remember
--
we
each
have
a
million
children
to
love
and
serve
--
OUR
*NL*
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
beyond
me
.
To
hear
a
lot
of
women
talk
about
``
our
children
''
!
But
*NL*
I
suppose
that
is
the
way
the
ants
and
bees
would
talk
--
do
talk
,
maybe
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
what
they
did
,
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
woman
chose
to
be
a
mother
,
she
allowed
the
child-longing
to
*NL*
grow
within
her
till
it
worked
its
natural
miracle
.
When
she
did
not
so
*NL*
choose
she
put
the
whole
thing
out
of
her
mind
,
and
fed
her
heart
with
*NL*
the
other
babies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
me
see
--
with
us
,
children
--
minors
,
that
is
--
constitute
about
*NL*
three-fifths
of
the
population
;
with
them
only
about
one-third
,
or
*NL*
less
.
And
precious
--
!
No
sole
heir
to
an
empire
's
throne
,
no
solitary
*NL*
millionaire
baby
,
no
only
child
of
middle-aged
parents
,
could
compare
as
*NL*
an
idol
with
these
Herland
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
I
start
on
that
subject
I
must
finish
up
that
little
analysis
*NL*
I
was
trying
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
effectually
and
permanently
limit
the
population
in
numbers
,
so
*NL*
that
the
country
furnished
plenty
for
the
fullest
,
richest
life
for
all
*NL*
of
them
:
plenty
of
everything
,
including
room
,
air
,
solitude
even
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
they
set
to
work
to
improve
that
population
in
quality
--
since
*NL*
they
were
restricted
in
quantity
.
This
they
had
been
at
work
on
,
*NL*
uninterruptedly
,
for
some
fifteen
hundred
years
.
Do
you
wonder
they
were
*NL*
nice
people
?
*NL*
*NL*
Physiology
,
hygiene
,
sanitation
,
physical
culture
--
all
that
line
of
work
*NL*
had
been
perfected
long
since
.
Sickness
was
almost
wholly
unknown
among
*NL*
them
,
so
much
so
that
a
previously
high
development
in
what
we
call
the
*NL*
``
science
of
medicine
''
had
become
practically
a
lost
art
.
They
were
a
*NL*
clean-bred
,
vigorous
lot
,
having
the
best
of
care
,
the
most
perfect
*NL*
living
conditions
always
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
came
to
psychology
--
there
was
no
one
thing
which
left
us
so
*NL*
dumbfounded
,
so
really
awed
,
as
the
everyday
working
knowledge
--
and
*NL*
practice
--
they
had
in
this
line
.
As
we
learned
more
and
more
of
it
,
we
*NL*
learned
to
appreciate
the
exquisite
mastery
with
which
we
ourselves
,
*NL*
strangers
of
alien
race
,
of
unknown
opposite
sex
,
had
been
understood
*NL*
and
provided
for
from
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
wide
,
deep
,
thorough
knowledge
,
they
had
met
and
solved
the
*NL*
problems
of
education
in
ways
some
of
which
I
hope
to
make
clear
later
.
*NL*
Those
nation-loved
children
of
theirs
compared
with
the
average
in
our
*NL*
country
as
the
most
perfectly
cultivated
,
richly
developed
roses
compare
*NL*
with
--
tumbleweeds
.
Yet
they
did
not
SEEM
``
cultivated
''
at
all
--
it
had
all
*NL*
become
a
natural
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
people
,
steadily
developing
in
mental
capacity
,
in
will
power
,
*NL*
in
social
devotion
,
had
been
playing
with
the
arts
and
sciences
--
as
*NL*
far
as
they
knew
them
--
for
a
good
many
centuries
now
with
inevitable
*NL*
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
this
quiet
lovely
land
,
among
these
wise
,
sweet
,
strong
women
,
we
,
*NL*
in
our
easy
assumption
of
superiority
,
had
suddenly
arrived
;
and
now
,
*NL*
tamed
and
trained
to
a
degree
they
considered
safe
,
we
were
at
last
*NL*
brought
out
to
see
the
country
,
to
know
the
people
.

CHAPTER
7
.
Our
Growing
Modesty
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Being
at
last
considered
sufficiently
tamed
and
trained
to
be
trusted
*NL*
with
scissors
,
we
barbered
ourselves
as
best
we
could
.
A
close-trimmed
*NL*
beard
is
certainly
more
comfortable
than
a
full
one
.
Razors
,
naturally
,
*NL*
they
could
not
supply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
so
many
old
women
you
'd
think
there
'd
be
some
razors
,
''
sneered
*NL*
Terry
.
Whereat
Jeff
pointed
out
that
he
never
before
had
seen
such
*NL*
complete
absence
of
facial
hair
on
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looks
to
me
as
if
the
absence
of
men
made
them
more
feminine
in
that
*NL*
regard
,
anyhow
,
''
he
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
the
only
one
then
,
''
Terry
reluctantly
agreed
.
``
A
less
*NL*
feminine
lot
I
never
saw
.
A
child
apiece
does
n't
seem
to
be
enough
to
*NL*
develop
what
I
call
motherliness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
's
idea
of
motherliness
was
the
usual
one
,
involving
a
baby
in
*NL*
arms
,
or
``
a
little
flock
about
her
knees
,
''
and
the
complete
absorption
*NL*
of
the
mother
in
said
baby
or
flock
.
A
motherliness
which
dominated
*NL*
society
,
which
influenced
every
art
and
industry
,
which
absolutely
*NL*
protected
all
childhood
,
and
gave
to
it
the
most
perfect
care
and
*NL*
training
,
did
not
seem
motherly
--
to
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
become
well
used
to
the
clothes
.
They
were
quite
as
comfortable
*NL*
as
our
own
--
in
some
ways
more
so
--
and
undeniably
better
looking
.
As
to
*NL*
pockets
,
they
left
nothing
to
be
desired
.
That
second
garment
was
fairly
*NL*
quilted
with
pockets
.
They
were
most
ingeniously
arranged
,
so
as
to
be
*NL*
convenient
to
the
hand
and
not
inconvenient
to
the
body
,
and
were
so
*NL*
placed
as
at
once
to
strengthen
the
garment
and
add
decorative
lines
of
*NL*
stitching
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
,
as
in
so
many
other
points
we
had
now
to
observe
,
there
was
*NL*
shown
the
action
of
a
practical
intelligence
,
coupled
with
fine
artistic
*NL*
feeling
,
and
,
apparently
,
untrammeled
by
any
injurious
influences
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
first
step
of
comparative
freedom
was
a
personally
conducted
tour
of
*NL*
the
country
.
No
pentagonal
bodyguard
now
!
Only
our
special
tutors
,
*NL*
and
we
got
on
famously
with
them
.
Jeff
said
he
loved
Zava
like
an
*NL*
aunt
--
``
only
jollier
than
any
aunt
I
ever
saw
''
;
Somel
and
I
were
as
*NL*
chummy
as
could
be
--
the
best
of
friends
;
but
it
was
funny
to
watch
Terry
*NL*
and
Moadine
.
She
was
patient
with
him
,
and
courteous
,
but
it
was
like
*NL*
the
patience
and
courtesy
of
some
great
man
,
say
a
skilled
,
experienced
*NL*
diplomat
,
with
a
schoolgirl
.
Her
grave
acquiescence
with
his
most
*NL*
preposterous
expression
of
feeling
;
her
genial
laughter
,
not
only
*NL*
with
,
but
,
I
often
felt
,
at
him
--
though
impeccably
polite
;
her
*NL*
innocent
questions
,
which
almost
invariably
led
him
to
say
more
than
he
*NL*
intended
--
Jeff
and
I
found
it
all
amusing
to
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
seemed
to
recognize
that
quiet
background
of
superiority
.
When
*NL*
she
dropped
an
argument
he
always
thought
he
had
silenced
her
;
when
she
*NL*
laughed
he
thought
it
tribute
to
his
wit
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hated
to
admit
to
myself
how
much
Terry
had
sunk
in
my
esteem
.
Jeff
*NL*
felt
it
too
,
I
am
sure
;
but
neither
of
us
admitted
it
to
the
other
.
*NL*
At
home
we
had
measured
him
with
other
men
,
and
,
though
we
knew
his
*NL*
failings
,
he
was
by
no
means
an
unusual
type
.
We
knew
his
virtues
too
,
*NL*
and
they
had
always
seemed
more
prominent
than
the
faults
.
Measured
*NL*
among
women
--
our
women
at
home
,
I
mean
--
he
had
always
stood
high
.
He
*NL*
was
visibly
popular
.
Even
where
his
habits
were
known
,
there
was
no
*NL*
discrimination
against
him
;
in
some
cases
his
reputation
for
what
was
*NL*
felicitously
termed
``
gaiety
''
seemed
a
special
charm
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
,
against
the
calm
wisdom
and
quiet
restrained
humor
of
these
*NL*
women
,
with
only
that
blessed
Jeff
and
my
inconspicuous
self
to
compare
*NL*
with
,
Terry
did
stand
out
rather
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
``
a
man
among
men
,
''
he
did
n't
;
as
a
man
among
--
I
shall
have
to
say
,
*NL*
``
females
,
''
he
did
n't
;
his
intense
masculinity
seemed
only
fit
complement
*NL*
to
their
intense
femininity
.
But
here
he
was
all
out
of
drawing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moadine
was
a
big
woman
,
with
a
balanced
strength
that
seldom
showed
.
*NL*
Her
eye
was
as
quietly
watchful
as
a
fencer
's
.
She
maintained
a
pleasant
*NL*
relation
with
her
charge
,
but
I
doubt
if
many
,
even
in
that
country
,
*NL*
could
have
done
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
her
``
Maud
,
''
amongst
ourselves
,
and
said
she
was
``
a
good
old
*NL*
soul
,
but
a
little
slow
''
;
wherein
he
was
quite
wrong
.
Needless
to
*NL*
say
,
he
called
Jeff
's
teacher
``
Java
,
''
and
sometimes
``
Mocha
,
''
or
plain
*NL*
``
Coffee
''
;
when
specially
mischievous
,
``
Chicory
,
''
and
even
``
Postum
.
''
But
*NL*
Somel
rather
escaped
this
form
of
humor
,
save
for
a
rather
forced
``
Some
*NL*
`
ell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
people
have
but
one
name
?
''
he
asked
one
day
,
after
we
*NL*
had
been
introduced
to
a
whole
group
of
them
,
all
with
pleasant
,
*NL*
few-syllabled
strange
names
,
like
the
ones
we
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
Moadine
told
him
.
``
A
good
many
of
us
have
another
,
as
we
get
*NL*
on
in
life
--
a
descriptive
one
.
That
is
the
name
we
earn
.
Sometimes
even
*NL*
that
is
changed
,
or
added
to
,
in
an
unusually
rich
life
.
Such
as
our
*NL*
present
Land
Mother
--
what
you
call
president
or
king
,
I
believe
.
She
*NL*
was
called
Mera
,
even
as
a
child
;
that
means
`
thinker
.
'
Later
there
*NL*
was
added
Du
--
Du-Mera
--
the
wise
thinker
,
and
now
we
all
know
her
as
*NL*
O-du-mera
--
great
and
wise
thinker
.
You
shall
meet
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
surnames
at
all
then
?
''
pursued
Terry
,
with
his
somewhat
patronizing
*NL*
air
.
``
No
family
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
no
,
''
she
said
.
``
Why
should
we
?
We
are
all
descended
from
a
common
*NL*
source
--
all
one
`
family
'
in
reality
.
You
see
,
our
comparatively
brief
*NL*
and
limited
history
gives
us
that
advantage
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
does
not
each
mother
want
her
own
child
to
bear
her
name
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
why
should
she
?
The
child
has
its
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
for
--
for
identification
--
so
people
will
know
whose
child
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
keep
the
most
careful
records
,
''
said
Somel
.
``
Each
one
of
us
has
our
*NL*
exact
line
of
descent
all
the
way
back
to
our
dear
First
Mother
.
There
*NL*
are
many
reasons
for
doing
that
.
But
as
to
everyone
knowing
which
child
*NL*
belongs
to
which
mother
--
why
should
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
as
in
so
many
other
instances
,
we
were
led
to
feel
the
difference
*NL*
between
the
purely
maternal
and
the
paternal
attitude
of
mind
.
The
*NL*
element
of
personal
pride
seemed
strangely
lacking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
your
other
works
?
''
asked
Jeff
.
``
Do
n't
you
sign
your
names
to
*NL*
them
--
books
and
statues
and
so
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
surely
,
we
are
all
glad
and
proud
to
.
Not
only
books
and
statues
,
*NL*
but
all
kinds
of
work
.
You
will
find
little
names
on
the
houses
,
on
the
*NL*
furniture
,
on
the
dishes
sometimes
.
Because
otherwise
one
is
likely
to
*NL*
forget
,
and
we
want
to
know
to
whom
to
be
grateful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
as
if
it
were
done
for
the
convenience
of
the
consumer
--
not
*NL*
the
pride
of
the
producer
,
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
both
,
''
said
Somel
.
``
We
have
pride
enough
in
our
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
not
in
your
children
?
''
urged
Jeff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
have
!
We
're
magnificently
proud
of
them
,
''
she
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
not
sign
'em
?
''
said
Terry
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moadine
turned
to
him
with
her
slightly
quizzical
smile
.
``
Because
the
*NL*
finished
product
is
not
a
private
one
.
When
they
are
babies
,
we
do
speak
*NL*
of
them
,
at
times
,
as
`
Essa
's
Lato
,
'
or
`
Novine
's
Amel
'
;
but
that
is
*NL*
merely
descriptive
and
conversational
.
In
the
records
,
of
course
,
*NL*
the
child
stands
in
her
own
line
of
mothers
;
but
in
dealing
with
it
*NL*
personally
it
is
Lato
,
or
Amel
,
without
dragging
in
its
ancestors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
have
you
names
enough
to
give
a
new
one
to
each
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assuredly
we
have
,
for
each
living
generation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
asked
about
our
methods
,
and
found
first
that
``
we
''
did
so
and
*NL*
so
,
and
then
that
other
nations
did
differently
.
Upon
which
they
wanted
*NL*
to
know
which
method
has
been
proved
best
--
and
we
had
to
admit
that
*NL*
so
far
as
we
knew
there
had
been
no
attempt
at
comparison
,
each
people
*NL*
pursuing
its
own
custom
in
the
fond
conviction
of
superiority
,
and
*NL*
either
despising
or
quite
ignoring
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
women
the
most
salient
quality
in
all
their
institutions
was
*NL*
reasonableness
.
When
I
dug
into
the
records
to
follow
out
any
line
of
*NL*
development
,
that
was
the
most
astonishing
thing
--
the
conscious
effort
*NL*
to
make
it
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
early
observed
the
value
of
certain
improvements
,
had
easily
*NL*
inferred
that
there
was
room
for
more
,
and
took
the
greatest
pains
to
*NL*
develop
two
kinds
of
minds
--
the
critic
and
inventor
.
Those
who
showed
*NL*
an
early
tendency
to
observe
,
to
discriminate
,
to
suggest
,
were
given
*NL*
special
training
for
that
function
;
and
some
of
their
highest
officials
*NL*
spent
their
time
in
the
most
careful
study
of
one
or
another
branch
of
*NL*
work
,
with
a
view
to
its
further
improvement
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
each
generation
there
was
sure
to
arrive
some
new
mind
to
detect
*NL*
faults
and
show
need
of
alterations
;
and
the
whole
corps
of
inventors
*NL*
was
at
hand
to
apply
their
special
faculty
at
the
point
criticized
,
and
*NL*
offer
suggestions
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
learned
by
this
time
not
to
open
a
discussion
on
any
of
their
*NL*
characteristics
without
first
priming
ourselves
to
answer
questions
*NL*
about
our
own
methods
;
so
I
kept
rather
quiet
on
this
matter
of
*NL*
conscious
improvement
.
We
were
not
prepared
to
show
our
way
was
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
growing
in
our
minds
,
at
least
in
Jeff
's
and
mine
,
a
*NL*
keen
appreciation
of
the
advantages
of
this
strange
country
and
its
*NL*
management
.
Terry
remained
critical
.
We
laid
most
of
it
to
his
nerves
.
*NL*
He
certainly
was
irritable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
conspicuous
feature
of
the
whole
land
was
the
perfection
of
*NL*
its
food
supply
.
We
had
begun
to
notice
from
that
very
first
walk
in
the
*NL*
forest
,
the
first
partial
view
from
our
`
plane
.
Now
we
were
taken
to
see
*NL*
this
mighty
garden
,
and
shown
its
methods
of
culture
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
country
was
about
the
size
of
Holland
,
some
ten
or
twelve
*NL*
thousand
square
miles
.
One
could
lose
a
good
many
Hollands
along
the
*NL*
forest-smothered
flanks
of
those
mighty
mountains
.
They
had
a
population
*NL*
of
about
three
million
--
not
a
large
one
,
but
quality
is
something
.
Three
*NL*
million
is
quite
enough
to
allow
for
considerable
variation
,
and
these
*NL*
people
varied
more
widely
than
we
could
at
first
account
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
had
insisted
that
if
they
were
parthenogenetic
they
'd
be
as
alike
*NL*
as
so
many
ants
or
aphids
;
he
urged
their
visible
differences
as
proof
*NL*
that
there
must
be
men
--
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
we
asked
them
,
in
our
later
,
more
intimate
conversations
,
how
*NL*
they
accounted
for
so
much
divergence
without
cross-fertilization
,
*NL*
they
attributed
it
partly
to
the
careful
education
,
which
followed
each
*NL*
slight
tendency
to
differ
,
and
partly
to
the
law
of
mutation
.
This
they
*NL*
had
found
in
their
work
with
plants
,
and
fully
proven
in
their
own
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Physically
they
were
more
alike
than
we
,
as
they
lacked
all
morbid
or
*NL*
excessive
types
.
They
were
tall
,
strong
,
healthy
,
and
beautiful
as
a
*NL*
race
,
but
differed
individually
in
a
wide
range
of
feature
,
coloring
,
*NL*
and
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
the
most
important
growth
is
in
mind
--
and
in
the
things
we
*NL*
make
,
''
urged
Somel
.
``
Do
you
find
your
physical
variation
accompanied
by
*NL*
a
proportionate
variation
in
ideas
,
feelings
,
and
products
?
Or
,
among
*NL*
people
who
look
more
alike
,
do
you
find
their
internal
life
and
their
*NL*
work
as
similar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
rather
doubtful
on
this
point
,
and
inclined
to
hold
that
there
*NL*
was
more
chance
of
improvement
in
greater
physical
variation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
certainly
should
be
,
''
Zava
admitted
.
``
We
have
always
thought
it
a
*NL*
grave
initial
misfortune
to
have
lost
half
our
little
world
.
Perhaps
*NL*
that
is
one
reason
why
we
have
so
striven
for
conscious
improvement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
acquired
traits
are
not
transmissible
,
''
Terry
declared
.
``
Weissman
*NL*
has
proved
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
never
disputed
our
absolute
statements
,
only
made
notes
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
so
,
then
our
improvement
must
be
due
either
to
mutation
,
or
*NL*
solely
to
education
,
''
she
gravely
pursued
.
``
We
certainly
have
improved
.
*NL*
It
may
be
that
all
these
higher
qualities
were
latent
in
the
original
*NL*
mother
,
that
careful
education
is
bringing
them
out
,
and
that
our
*NL*
personal
differences
depend
on
slight
variations
in
prenatal
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
more
in
your
accumulated
culture
,
''
Jeff
suggested
.
``
And
*NL*
in
the
amazing
psychic
growth
you
have
made
.
We
know
very
little
about
*NL*
methods
of
real
soul
culture
--
and
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Be
that
as
it
might
,
they
certainly
presented
a
higher
level
of
active
*NL*
intelligence
,
and
of
behavior
,
than
we
had
so
far
really
grasped
.
Having
*NL*
known
in
our
lives
several
people
who
showed
the
same
delicate
courtesy
*NL*
and
were
equally
pleasant
to
live
with
,
at
least
when
they
wore
their
*NL*
``
company
manners
,
''
we
had
assumed
that
our
companions
were
a
carefully
*NL*
chosen
few
.
Later
we
were
more
and
more
impressed
that
all
this
gentle
*NL*
breeding
was
breeding
;
that
they
were
born
to
it
,
reared
in
it
,
that
it
*NL*
was
as
natural
and
universal
with
them
as
the
gentleness
of
doves
or
the
*NL*
alleged
wisdom
of
serpents
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
intelligence
,
I
confess
that
this
was
the
most
impressive
*NL*
and
,
to
me
,
most
mortifying
,
of
any
single
feature
of
Herland
.
We
soon
*NL*
ceased
to
comment
on
this
or
other
matters
which
to
them
were
such
*NL*
obvious
commonplaces
as
to
call
forth
embarrassing
questions
about
our
*NL*
own
conditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
nowhere
better
shown
than
in
that
matter
of
food
supply
,
which
*NL*
I
will
now
attempt
to
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
improved
their
agriculture
to
the
highest
point
,
and
carefully
*NL*
estimated
the
number
of
persons
who
could
comfortably
live
on
their
*NL*
square
miles
;
having
then
limited
their
population
to
that
number
,
one
*NL*
would
think
that
was
all
there
was
to
be
done
.
But
they
had
not
thought
*NL*
so
.
To
them
the
country
was
a
unit
--
it
was
theirs
.
They
themselves
were
*NL*
a
unit
,
a
conscious
group
;
they
thought
in
terms
of
the
community
.
As
*NL*
such
,
their
time-sense
was
not
limited
to
the
hopes
and
ambitions
of
an
*NL*
individual
life
.
Therefore
,
they
habitually
considered
and
carried
out
*NL*
plans
for
improvement
which
might
cover
centuries
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
seen
,
had
scarcely
imagined
,
human
beings
undertaking
such
*NL*
a
work
as
the
deliberate
replanting
of
an
entire
forest
area
with
*NL*
different
kinds
of
trees
.
Yet
this
seemed
to
them
the
simplest
common
*NL*
sense
,
like
a
man
's
plowing
up
an
inferior
lawn
and
reseeding
it
.
Now
*NL*
every
tree
bore
fruit
--
edible
fruit
,
that
is
.
In
the
case
of
one
*NL*
tree
,
in
which
they
took
especial
pride
,
it
had
originally
no
fruit
at
*NL*
all
--
that
is
,
none
humanly
edible
--
yet
was
so
beautiful
that
they
wished
*NL*
to
keep
it
.
For
nine
hundred
years
they
had
experimented
,
and
now
*NL*
showed
us
this
particularly
lovely
graceful
tree
,
with
a
profuse
crop
of
*NL*
nutritious
seeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
early
decided
that
trees
were
the
best
food
plants
,
requiring
*NL*
far
less
labor
in
tilling
the
soil
,
and
bearing
a
larger
amount
of
food
*NL*
for
the
same
ground
space
;
also
doing
much
to
preserve
and
enrich
the
*NL*
soil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Due
regard
had
been
paid
to
seasonable
crops
,
and
their
fruit
and
nuts
,
*NL*
grains
and
berries
,
kept
on
almost
the
year
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
higher
part
of
the
country
,
near
the
backing
wall
of
mountains
,
*NL*
they
had
a
real
winter
with
snow
.
Toward
the
south-eastern
point
,
where
*NL*
there
was
a
large
valley
with
a
lake
whose
outlet
was
subterranean
,
the
*NL*
climate
was
like
that
of
California
,
and
citrus
fruits
,
figs
,
and
olives
*NL*
grew
abundantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
impressed
me
particularly
was
their
scheme
of
fertilization
.
Here
*NL*
was
this
little
shut-in
piece
of
land
where
one
would
have
thought
an
*NL*
ordinary
people
would
have
been
starved
out
long
ago
or
reduced
to
an
*NL*
annual
struggle
for
life
.
These
careful
culturists
had
worked
out
a
*NL*
perfect
scheme
of
refeeding
the
soil
with
all
that
came
out
of
it
.
All
*NL*
the
scraps
and
leavings
of
their
food
,
plant
waste
from
lumber
work
or
*NL*
textile
industry
,
all
the
solid
matter
from
the
sewage
,
properly
treated
*NL*
and
combined
--
everything
which
came
from
the
earth
went
back
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
practical
result
was
like
that
in
any
healthy
forest
;
an
*NL*
increasingly
valuable
soil
was
being
built
,
instead
of
the
progressive
*NL*
impoverishment
so
often
seen
in
the
rest
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
first
burst
upon
us
we
made
such
approving
comments
that
they
*NL*
were
surprised
that
such
obvious
common
sense
should
be
praised
;
asked
*NL*
what
our
methods
were
;
and
we
had
some
difficulty
in
--
well
,
in
*NL*
diverting
them
,
by
referring
to
the
extent
of
our
own
land
,
and
*NL*
the
--
admitted
--
carelessness
with
which
we
had
skimmed
the
cream
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
least
we
thought
we
had
diverted
them
.
Later
I
found
that
besides
*NL*
keeping
a
careful
and
accurate
account
of
all
we
told
them
,
they
had
a
*NL*
sort
of
skeleton
chart
,
on
which
the
things
we
said
and
the
things
we
*NL*
palpably
avoided
saying
were
all
set
down
and
studied
.
It
really
was
*NL*
child
's
play
for
those
profound
educators
to
work
out
a
painfully
*NL*
accurate
estimate
of
our
conditions
--
in
some
lines
.
When
a
given
line
of
*NL*
observation
seemed
to
lead
to
some
very
dreadful
inference
they
always
*NL*
gave
us
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
,
leaving
it
open
to
further
knowledge
.
*NL*
Some
of
the
things
we
had
grown
to
accept
as
perfectly
natural
,
or
*NL*
as
belonging
to
our
human
limitations
,
they
literally
could
not
have
*NL*
believed
;
and
,
as
I
have
said
,
we
had
all
of
us
joined
in
a
tacit
*NL*
endeavor
to
conceal
much
of
the
social
status
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
their
grandmotherly
minds
!
''
Terry
said
.
``
Of
course
they
ca
n't
*NL*
understand
a
Man
's
World
!
They
are
n't
human
--
they
're
just
a
pack
of
*NL*
Fe-Fe-Females
!
''
This
was
after
he
had
to
admit
their
parthenogenesis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
our
grandfatherly
minds
had
managed
as
well
,
''
said
Jeff
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
really
think
it
's
to
our
credit
that
we
have
muddled
along
with
all
our
*NL*
poverty
and
disease
and
the
like
?
They
have
peace
and
plenty
,
wealth
and
*NL*
beauty
,
goodness
and
intellect
.
Pretty
good
people
,
I
think
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
find
they
have
their
faults
too
,
''
Terry
insisted
;
and
partly
in
*NL*
self-defense
,
we
all
three
began
to
look
for
those
faults
of
theirs
.
*NL*
We
had
been
very
strong
on
this
subject
before
we
got
there
--
in
those
*NL*
baseless
speculations
of
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
there
is
a
country
of
women
only
,
''
Jeff
had
put
it
,
over
and
*NL*
over
.
``
What
'll
they
be
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
had
been
cocksure
as
to
the
inevitable
limitations
,
the
faults
*NL*
and
vices
,
of
a
lot
of
women
.
We
had
expected
them
to
be
given
over
to
*NL*
what
we
called
``
feminine
vanity
''
--
``
frills
and
furbelows
,
''
and
we
found
*NL*
they
had
evolved
a
costume
more
perfect
than
the
Chinese
dress
,
richly
*NL*
beautiful
when
so
desired
,
always
useful
,
of
unfailing
dignity
and
good
*NL*
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
expected
a
dull
submissive
monotony
,
and
found
a
daring
social
*NL*
inventiveness
far
beyond
our
own
,
and
a
mechanical
and
scientific
*NL*
development
fully
equal
to
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
expected
pettiness
,
and
found
a
social
consciousness
besides
*NL*
which
our
nations
looked
like
quarreling
children
--
feebleminded
ones
at
*NL*
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
expected
jealousy
,
and
found
a
broad
sisterly
affection
,
a
*NL*
fair-minded
intelligence
,
to
which
we
could
produce
no
parallel
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
expected
hysteria
,
and
found
a
standard
of
health
and
vigor
,
a
*NL*
calmness
of
temper
,
to
which
the
habit
of
profanity
,
for
instance
,
was
*NL*
impossible
to
explain
--
we
tried
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
things
even
Terry
had
to
admit
,
but
he
still
insisted
that
we
*NL*
should
find
out
the
other
side
pretty
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
stands
to
reason
,
does
n't
it
?
''
he
argued
.
``
The
whole
thing
's
deuced
*NL*
unnatural
--
I
'd
say
impossible
if
we
were
n't
in
it
.
And
an
unnatural
*NL*
condition
's
sure
to
have
unnatural
results
.
You
'll
find
some
awful
*NL*
characteristics
--
see
if
you
do
n't
!
For
instance
--
we
do
n't
know
yet
what
*NL*
they
do
with
their
criminals
--
their
defectives
--
their
aged
.
You
notice
*NL*
we
have
n't
seen
any
!
There
's
got
to
be
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
inclined
to
believe
that
there
had
to
be
something
,
so
I
took
the
*NL*
bull
by
the
horns
--
the
cow
,
I
should
say
!
--
and
asked
Somel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
find
some
flaw
in
all
this
perfection
,
''
I
told
her
flatly
.
*NL*
``
It
simply
is
n't
possible
that
three
million
people
have
no
faults
.
We
*NL*
are
trying
our
best
to
understand
and
learn
--
would
you
mind
helping
us
*NL*
by
saying
what
,
to
your
minds
,
are
the
worst
qualities
of
this
unique
*NL*
civilization
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
sitting
together
in
a
shaded
arbor
,
in
one
of
those
*NL*
eating-gardens
of
theirs
.
The
delicious
food
had
been
eaten
,
a
plate
of
*NL*
fruit
still
before
us
.
We
could
look
out
on
one
side
over
a
stretch
of
*NL*
open
country
,
quietly
rich
and
lovely
;
on
the
other
,
the
garden
,
with
*NL*
tables
here
and
there
,
far
apart
enough
for
privacy
.
Let
me
say
right
*NL*
here
that
with
all
their
careful
``
balance
of
population
''
there
was
no
*NL*
crowding
in
this
country
.
There
was
room
,
space
,
a
sunny
breezy
freedom
*NL*
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somel
set
her
chin
upon
her
hand
,
her
elbow
on
the
low
wall
beside
her
,
*NL*
and
looked
off
over
the
fair
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
we
have
faults
--
all
of
us
,
''
she
said
.
``
In
one
way
you
*NL*
might
say
that
we
have
more
than
we
used
to
--
that
is
,
our
standard
*NL*
of
perfection
seems
to
get
farther
and
farther
away
.
But
we
are
not
*NL*
discouraged
,
because
our
records
do
show
gain
--
considerable
gain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
began
--
even
with
the
start
of
one
particularly
noble
mother
--
we
*NL*
inherited
the
characteristics
of
a
long
race-record
behind
her
.
And
they
*NL*
cropped
out
from
time
to
time
--
alarmingly
.
But
it
is
--
yes
,
quite
six
*NL*
hundred
years
since
we
have
had
what
you
call
a
`
criminal
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
,
of
course
,
made
it
our
first
business
to
train
out
,
to
breed
*NL*
out
,
when
possible
,
the
lowest
types
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Breed
out
?
''
I
asked
.
``
How
could
you
--
with
parthenogenesis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
girl
showing
the
bad
qualities
had
still
the
power
to
appreciate
*NL*
social
duty
,
we
appealed
to
her
,
by
that
,
to
renounce
motherhood
.
Some
*NL*
of
the
few
worst
types
were
,
fortunately
,
unable
to
reproduce
.
But
if
*NL*
the
fault
was
in
a
disproportionate
egotism
--
then
the
girl
was
sure
*NL*
she
had
the
right
to
have
children
,
even
that
hers
would
be
better
than
*NL*
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
see
that
,
''
I
said
.
``
And
then
she
would
be
likely
to
rear
them
in
*NL*
the
same
spirit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
we
never
allowed
,
''
answered
Somel
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allowed
?
''
I
queried
.
``
Allowed
a
mother
to
rear
her
own
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
''
said
Somel
,
``
unless
she
was
fit
for
that
supreme
task
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
rather
a
blow
to
my
previous
convictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
motherhood
was
for
each
of
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Motherhood
--
yes
,
that
is

maternity
,
to
bear
a
child

*NL*
our
highest
art
,
only
allowed
to
our
highest
artists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Education
?
''
I
was
puzzled
again
.
``
I
do
n't
mean
education
.
I
mean
by
*NL*
motherhood
not
only
child-bearing
,
but
the
care
of
babies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
care
of
babies
involves
education
,
and
is
entrusted
only
to
the
*NL*
most
fit
,
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
separate
mother
and
child
!
''
I
cried
in
cold
horror
,
something
*NL*
of
Terry
's
feeling
creeping
over
me
,
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
*NL*
among
these
many
virtues
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
usually
,
''
she
patiently
explained
.
``
You
see
,
almost
every
woman
*NL*
values
her
maternity
above
everything
else
.
Each
girl
holds
it
close
*NL*
and
dear
,
an
exquisite
joy
,
a
crowning
honor
,
the
most
intimate
,
most
*NL*
personal
,
most
precious
thing
.
That
is
,
the
child-rearing
has
come
to
*NL*
be
with
us
a
culture
so
profoundly
studied
,
practiced
with
such
subtlety
*NL*
and
skill
,
that
the
more
we
love
our
children
the
less
we
are
willing
to
*NL*
trust
that
process
to
unskilled
hands

even
our
own
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
a
mother
's
love
--
''
I
ventured
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
studied
my
face
,
trying
to
work
out
a
means
of
clear
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
us
about
your
dentists
,
''
she
said
,
at
length
,
``
those
quaintly
*NL*
specialized
persons
who
spend
their
lives
filling
little
holes
in
other

persons

teeth

even
in
children
's
teeth
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
I
said
,
not
getting
her
drift
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
mother-love
urge
mothers
--
with
you
--
to
fill
their
own
children
's

teeth
?

to
wish
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
no
--
of
course
not
,
''
I
protested
.
``
But
that
is
a
highly
specialized
*NL*
craft
.
Surely
the
care
of
babies
is
open
to
any
woman
--
any
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
not
think
so
,
''
she
gently
replied
.
``
Those
of
us
who
are
the
*NL*
most
highly
competent
fulfill
that
office
;
and
a
majority
of
our
girls
*NL*
eagerly
try
for
it
--
I
assure
you
we
have
the
very
best
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
poor
mother
--
bereaved
of
her
baby
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!

she
earnestly
assured
me
.
``
Not
in
the

bereaved

It
is
her

baby
still

it

with
her

lost
it

But
she
is
not
the
only
*NL*
one
to
care
for
it

There
are
others
whom
she
knows
to
be
wiser

She
*NL*
knows
it
because
she
has
studied
as
they
did
,
practiced
as
they
did
,
and
*NL*
honors
their
real
superiority
.
For
the
child
's
sake
,
she
is
glad
to
have
*NL*
for
it
this
highest
care

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
unconvinced
.
Besides
,
this
was
only
hearsay
;
I
had
yet
to
see
the

motherhood
of

The
Girls
of
Herland

*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Terry
's
ambition
was
realized
.
We
were
invited
,
always
*NL*
courteously
and
with
free
choice
on
our
part
,
to
address
general
*NL*
audiences
and
classes
of
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
the
first
time
--
and
how
careful
we
were
about
our
clothes
,
*NL*
and
our
amateur
barbering

in
particular
,
was
fussy
to
a
degree
*NL*
about
the
cut
of
his
beard
,
and
so
critical
of
our
combined
efforts
,
*NL*
that
we
handed
him
the
shears
and
told
him
to
please
himself
.
We
*NL*
began
to
rather
prize
those
beards
of
ours
;
they
were
almost
our
sole
*NL*
distinction
among
those
tall
and
sturdy
women
,
with
their
cropped
hair
*NL*
and
sexless
costume
.
Being
offered
a
wide
selection
of
garments
,
we
had
*NL*
chosen
according
to
our
personal
taste
,
and
were
surprised
to
find
,
*NL*
on
meeting
large
audiences
,
that
we
were
the
most
highly
decorated
,
*NL*
especially
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
very
impressive
figure
,
his
strong
features
softened
by
the
*NL*
somewhat
longer
hair
--
though
he
made
me
trim
it
as
closely
as
I
knew
*NL*
how
;
and
he
wore
his
richly
embroidered
tunic
with
its
broad
,
loose
*NL*
girdle
with
quite
a
Henry
V
air
.
Jeff
looked
more
like
--
well
,
like
a
*NL*
Huguenot
Lover
;
and
I
do
n't
know
what
I
looked
like
,
only
that
I
felt
*NL*
very
comfortable
.
When
I
got
back
to
our
own
padded
armor
and
its
*NL*
starched
borders
I
realized
with
acute
regret
how
comfortable
were
those
*NL*
Herland
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
scanned
that
audience
,
looking
for
the
three
bright
faces
we
knew
;
*NL*
but
they
were
not
to
be
seen
.
Just
a
multitude
of
girls
:
quiet
,
eager
,
*NL*
watchful
,
all
eyes
and
ears
to
listen
and
learn
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
been
urged
to
give
,
as
fully
as
we
cared
to
,
a
sort
of
synopsis
*NL*
of
world
history
,
in
brief
,
and
to
answer
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
so
utterly
ignorant
,
you
see
,
''
Moadine
had
explained
to
us
.
``
We
*NL*
know
nothing
but
such
science
as
we
have
worked
out
for
ourselves
,
*NL*
just
the
brain
work
of
one
small
half-country
;
and
you
,
we
gather
,
have
*NL*
helped
one
another
all
over
the
globe
,
sharing
your
discoveries
,
pooling
*NL*
your
progress
.
How
wonderful
,
how
supremely
beautiful
your
civilization
*NL*
must
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Somel
gave
a
further
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
have
to
begin
all
over
again
,
as
you
did
with
us
.
We
have
*NL*
made
a
sort
of
digest
of
what
we
have
learned
from
you
,
and
it
has
been
*NL*
eagerly
absorbed
,
all
over
the
country
.
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
*NL*
our
outline
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
eager
to
see
it
,
and
deeply
impressed
.
To
us
,
at
first
,
these
*NL*
women
,
unavoidably
ignorant
of
what
to
us
was
the
basic
commonplace
of
*NL*
knowledge
,
had
seemed
on
the
plane
of
children
,
or
of
savages
.
What
we
*NL*
had
been
forced
to
admit
,
with
growing
acquaintance
,
was
that
they
*NL*
were
ignorant
as
Plato
and
Aristotle
were
,
but
with
a
highly
developed
*NL*
mentality
quite
comparable
to
that
of
Ancient
Greece
.
*NL*
*NL*
Far
be
it
from
me
to
lumber
these
pages
with
an
account
of
what
we
so
*NL*
imperfectly
strove
to
teach
them
.
The
memorable
fact
is
what
they
taught
*NL*
us
,
or
some
faint
glimpse
of
it
.
And
at
present
,
our
major
interest
was
*NL*
not
at
all
in
the
subject
matter
of
our
talk
,
but
in
the
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Girls
--
hundreds
of
them
--
eager
,
bright-eyed
,
attentive
young
faces
;
*NL*
crowding
questions
,
and
,
I
regret
to
say
,
an
increasing
inability
on
our
*NL*
part
to
answer
them
effectively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
special
guides
,
who
were
on
the
platform
with
us
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
aided
in
clarifying
a
question
or
,
oftener
,
an
answer
,
noticed
this
*NL*
effect
,
and
closed
the
formal
lecture
part
of
the
evening
rather
*NL*
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
young
women
will
be
glad
to
meet
you
,
''
Somel
suggested
,
``
to
talk
*NL*
with
you
more
personally
,
if
you
are
willing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Willing
!
We
were
impatient
and
said
as
much
,
at
which
I
saw
a
flickering
*NL*
little
smile
cross
Moadine
's
face
.
Even
then
,
with
all
those
eager
young
*NL*
things
waiting
to
talk
to
us
,
a
sudden
question
crossed
my
mind
:
``
What
*NL*
was
their
point
of
view
?
What
did
they
think
of
us
?
''
We
learned
that
*NL*
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
plunged
in
among
those
young
creatures
with
a
sort
of
rapture
,
*NL*
somewhat
as
a
glad
swimmer
takes
to
the
sea
.
Jeff
,
with
a
rapt
look
on
*NL*
his
high-bred
face
,
approached
as
to
a
sacrament
.
But
I
was
a
little
*NL*
chilled
by
that
last
thought
of
mine
,
and
kept
my
eyes
open
.
I
found
*NL*
time
to
watch
Jeff
,
even
while
I
was
surrounded
by
an
eager
group
of
*NL*
questioners
--
as
we
all
were
--
and
saw
how
his
worshipping
eyes
,
his
grave
*NL*
courtesy
,
pleased
and
drew
some
of
them
;
while
others
,
rather
stronger
*NL*
spirits
they
looked
to
be
,
drew
away
from
his
group
to
Terry
's
or
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
watched
Terry
with
special
interest
,
knowing
how
he
had
longed
for
*NL*
this
time
,
and
how
irresistible
he
had
always
been
at
home
.
And
I
could
*NL*
see
,
just
in
snatches
,
of
course
,
how
his
suave
and
masterful
approach
*NL*
seemed
to
irritate
them
;
his
too-intimate
glances
were
vaguely
resented
,
*NL*
his
compliments
puzzled
and
annoyed
.
Sometimes
a
girl
would
flush
,
not
*NL*
with
drooped
eyelids
and
inviting
timidity
,
but
with
anger
and
a
quick
*NL*
lift
of
the
head
.
Girl
after
girl
turned
on
her
heel
and
left
him
,
till
*NL*
he
had
but
a
small
ring
of
questioners
,
and
they
,
visibly
,
were
the
*NL*
least
``
girlish
''
of
the
lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
him
looking
pleased
at
first
,
as
if
he
thought
he
was
making
*NL*
a
strong
impression
;
but
,
finally
,
casting
a
look
at
Jeff
,
or
me
,
he
*NL*
seemed
less
pleased
--
and
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
me
,
I
was
most
agreeably
surprised
.
At
home
I
never
*NL*
was
``
popular
.
''
I
had
my
girl
friends
,
good
ones
,
but
they
were
*NL*
friends
--
nothing
else
.
Also
they
were
of
somewhat
the
same
clan
,
not
*NL*
popular
in
the
sense
of
swarming
admirers
.
But
here
,
to
my
astonishment
,
*NL*
I
found
my
crowd
was
the
largest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
to
generalize
,
of
course
,
rather
telescoping
many
impressions
;
*NL*
but
the
first
evening
was
a
good
sample
of
the
impression
we
made
.
Jeff
*NL*
had
a
following
,
if
I
may
call
it
that
,
of
the
more
sentimental
--
though
*NL*
that
's
not
the
word
I
want
.
The
less
practical
,
perhaps
;
the
girls
who
*NL*
were
artists
of
some
sort
,
ethicists
,
teachers
--
that
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
reduced
to
a
rather
combative
group
:
keen
,
logical
,
inquiring
*NL*
minds
,
not
overly
sensitive
,
the
very
kind
he
liked
least
;
while
,
as
for
*NL*
me
--
I
became
quite
cocky
over
my
general
popularity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
furious
about
it
.
We
could
hardly
blame
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Girls
!
''
he
burst
forth
,
when
that
evening
was
over
and
we
were
by
*NL*
ourselves
once
more
.
``
Call
those
GIRLS
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
delightful
girls
,
I
call
them
,
''
said
Jeff
,
his
blue
eyes
dreamily
*NL*
contented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
YOU
call
them
?
''
I
mildly
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys
!
Nothing
but
boys
,
most
of
'em
.
A
standoffish
,
disagreeable
lot
at
*NL*
that
.
Critical
,
impertinent
youngsters
.
No
girls
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
angry
and
severe
,
not
a
little
jealous
,
too
,
I
think
.
Afterward
,
*NL*
when
he
found
out
just
what
it
was
they
did
not
like
,
he
changed
his
*NL*
manner
somewhat
and
got
on
better
.
He
had
to
.
For
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
criticism
,
they
were
girls
,
and
,
furthermore
,
all
the
girls
there
*NL*
were
!
Always
excepting
our
three
!
--
with
whom
we
presently
renewed
our
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
came
to
courtship
,
which
it
soon
did
,
I
can
of
course
best
*NL*
describe
my
own
--
and
am
least
inclined
to
.
But
of
Jeff
I
heard
somewhat
;
*NL*
he
was
inclined
to
dwell
reverently
and
admiringly
,
at
some
length
,
*NL*
on
the
exalted
sentiment
and
measureless
perfection
of
his
Celis
;
and
*NL*
Terry
--
Terry
made
so
many
false
starts
and
met
so
many
rebuffs
,
that
by
*NL*
the
time
he
really
settled
down
to
win
Alima
,
he
was
considerably
wiser
.
*NL*
At
that
,
it
was
not
smooth
sailing
.
They
broke
and
quarreled
,
over
and
*NL*
over
;
he
would
rush
off
to
console
himself
with
some
other
fair
one
--
the
*NL*
other
fair
one
would
have
none
of
him
--
and
he
would
drift
back
to
Alima
,
*NL*
becoming
more
and
more
devoted
each
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
gave
an
inch
.
A
big
,
handsome
creature
,
rather
exceptionally
*NL*
strong
even
in
that
race
of
strong
women
,
with
a
proud
head
and
sweeping
*NL*
level
brows
that
lined
across
above
her
dark
eager
eyes
like
the
wide
*NL*
wings
of
a
soaring
hawk
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
good
friends
with
all
three
of
them
but
best
of
all
with
Ellador
,
*NL*
long
before
that
feeling
changed
,
for
both
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
her
,
and
from
Somel
,
who
talked
very
freely
with
me
,
I
learned
at
*NL*
last
something
of
the
viewpoint
of
Herland
toward
its
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
they
were
,
isolated
,
happy
,
contented
,
when
the
booming
buzz
of
our
*NL*
biplane
tore
the
air
above
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
heard
it
--
saw
it
--
for
miles
and
miles
,
word
flashed
all
over
*NL*
the
country
,
and
a
council
was
held
in
every
town
and
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
was
their
rapid
determination
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
another
country
.
Probably
men
.
Evidently
highly
civilized
.
*NL*
Doubtless
possessed
of
much
valuable
knowledge
.
May
be
dangerous
.
Catch
*NL*
them
if
possible
;
tame
and
train
them
if
necessary
This
may
be
a
chance
*NL*
to
re-establish
a
bi-sexual
state
for
our
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
afraid
of
us
--
three
million
highly
intelligent
women
--
or
*NL*
two
million
,
counting
only
grown-ups
--
were
not
likely
to
be
afraid
of
*NL*
three
young
men
.
We
thought
of
them
as
``
Women
,
''
and
therefore
timid
;
but
*NL*
it
was
two
thousand
years
since
they
had
had
anything
to
be
afraid
*NL*
of
,
and
certainly
more
than
one
thousand
since
they
had
outgrown
the
*NL*
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
thought
--
at
least
Terry
did
--
that
we
could
have
our
pick
of
them
.
*NL*
They
thought
--
very
cautiously
and
farsightedly
--
of
picking
us
,
if
it
*NL*
seemed
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
time
we
were
in
training
they
studied
us
,
analyzed
us
,
prepared
*NL*
reports
about
us
,
and
this
information
was
widely
disseminated
all
about
*NL*
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
girl
in
that
country
had
not
been
learning
for
months
as
much
*NL*
as
could
be
gathered
about
our
country
,
our
culture
,
our
personal
*NL*
characters
.
No
wonder
their
questions
were
hard
to
answer
.
But
I
am
*NL*
sorry
to
say
,
when
we
were
at
last
brought
out
and
--
exhibited
-LRB-
I
hate
to
*NL*
call
it
that
,
but
that
's
what
it
was
-RRB-
,
there
was
no
rush
of
takers
.
Here
*NL*
was
poor
old
Terry
fondly
imagining
that
at
last
he
was
free
to
stray
in
*NL*
``
a
rosebud
garden
of
girls
''
--
and
behold
!
the
rosebuds
were
all
with
keen
*NL*
appraising
eye
,
studying
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
interested
,
profoundly
interested
,
but
it
was
not
the
kind
of
*NL*
interest
we
were
looking
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
get
an
idea
of
their
attitude
you
have
to
hold
in
mind
their
*NL*
extremely
high
sense
of
solidarity
.
They
were
not
each
choosing
a
*NL*
lover
;
they
had
n't
the
faintest
idea
of
love
--
sex-love
,
that
is
.
These
*NL*
girls
--
to
each
of
whom
motherhood
was
a
lodestar
,
and
that
motherhood
*NL*
exalted
above
a
mere
personal
function
,
looked
forward
to
as
the
highest
*NL*
social
service
,
as
the
sacrament
of
a
lifetime
--
were
now
confronted
with
*NL*
an
opportunity
to
make
the
great
step
of
changing
their
whole
status
,
of
*NL*
reverting
to
their
earlier
bi-sexual
order
of
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
this
underlying
consideration
there
was
the
limitless
interest
*NL*
and
curiosity
in
our
civilization
,
purely
impersonal
,
and
held
by
an
*NL*
order
of
mind
beside
which
we
were
like
--
schoolboys
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
small
wonder
that
our
lectures
were
not
a
success
;
and
none
at
*NL*
all
that
our
,
or
at
least
Terry
's
,
advances
were
so
ill
received
.
The
*NL*
reason
for
my
own
comparative
success
was
at
first
far
from
pleasing
to
*NL*
my
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
like
you
the
best
,
''
Somel
told
me
,
``
because
you
seem
more
like
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
like
a
lot
of
women
!
''
I
thought
to
myself
disgustedly
,
and
then
*NL*
remembered
how
little
like
``
women
,
''
in
our
derogatory
sense
,
they
were
.
*NL*
She
was
smiling
at
me
,
reading
my
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
quite
see
that
we
do
not
seem
like
--
women
--
to
you
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
in
a
bi-sexual
race
the
distinctive
feature
of
each
sex
must
be
*NL*
intensified
.
But
surely
there
are
characteristics
enough
which
belong
*NL*
to
People
,
are
n't
there
?
That
's
what
I
mean
about
you
being
more
like
*NL*

*NL*
Jeff
's
difficulty
was
his
exalted
gallantry
.
He
idealized
women
,
and
*NL*
was
always
looking
for
a
chance
to
``
protect
''
or
to
``
serve
''
them
.
These
*NL*
needed
neither
protection
nor
service
.
They
were
living
in
peace
and
*NL*
power
and
plenty
;
we
were
their
guests
,
their
prisoners
,
absolutely
*NL*
dependent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
we
could
promise
whatsoever
we
might
of
advantages
,
if
they
*NL*
would
come
to
our
country
;
but
the
more
we
knew
of
theirs
,
the
less
we
*NL*
boasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
's
jewels
and
trinkets
they
prized
as
curios
;
handed
them
about
,
*NL*
asking
questions
as
to
workmanship
,
not
in
the
least
as
to
value
;
and
*NL*
discussed
not
ownership
,
but
which
museum
to
put
them
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
man
has
nothing
to
give
a
woman
,
is
dependent
wholly
on
his
*NL*
personal
attraction
,
his
courtship
is
under
limitations
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
considering
these
two
things
:
the
advisability
of
making
the
*NL*
Great
Change
;
and
the
degree
of
personal
adaptability
which
would
best
*NL*
serve
that
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
we
had
the
advantage
of
our
small
personal
experience
with
those
*NL*
three
fleet
forest
girls
;
and
that
served
to
draw
us
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Ellador
:
Suppose
you
come
to
a
strange
land
and
find
it
pleasant
*NL*
enough
--
just
a
little
more
than
ordinarily
pleasant
--
and
then
you
find
*NL*
rich
farmland
,
and
then
gardens
,
gorgeous
gardens
,
and
then
palaces
*NL*
full
of
rare
and
curious
treasures
--
incalculable
,
inexhaustible
,
and
*NL*
then
--
mountains
--
like
the
Himalayas
,
and
then
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
liked
her
that
day
she
balanced
on
the
branch
before
me
and
named
the
*NL*
trio
.
I
thought
of
her
most
.
Afterward
I
turned
to
her
like
a
friend
*NL*
when
we
met
for
the
third
time
,
and
continued
the
acquaintance
.
While
*NL*
Jeff
's
ultra-devotion
rather
puzzled
Celis
,
really
put
off
their
day
*NL*
of
happiness
,
while
Terry
and
Alima
quarreled
and
parted
,
re-met
and
*NL*
re-parted
,
Ellador
and
I
grew
to
be
close
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
talked
and
talked
.
We
took
long
walks
together
.
She
showed
me
things
,
*NL*
explained
them
,
interpreted
much
that
I
had
not
understood
.
Through
her
*NL*
sympathetic
intelligence
I
became
more
and
more
comprehending
of
the
*NL*
spirit
of
the
people
of
Herland
,
more
and
more
appreciative
of
its
*NL*
marvelous
inner
growth
as
well
as
outer
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ceased
to
feel
a
stranger
,
a
prisoner
.
There
was
a
sense
of
*NL*
understanding
,
of
identity
,
of
purpose
.
We
discussed
--
everything
.
And
,
*NL*
as
I
traveled
farther
and
farther
,
exploring
the
rich
,
sweet
soul
of
*NL*
her
,
my
sense
of
pleasant
friendship
became
but
a
broad
foundation
for
*NL*
such
height
,
such
breadth
,
such
interlocked
combination
of
feeling
as
*NL*
left
me
fairly
blinded
with
the
wonder
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
've
said
,
I
had
never
cared
very
much
for
women
,
nor
they
for
*NL*
me
--
not
Terry-fashion
.
But
this
one
--
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
I
never
even
thought
of
her
``
in
that
way
,
''
as
the
girls
have
*NL*
it
.
I
had
not
come
to
the
country
with
any
Turkish-harem
intentions
,
*NL*
and
I
was
no
woman-worshipper
like
Jeff
.
I
just
liked
that
girl
``
as
a
*NL*
friend
,
''
as
we
say
.
That
friendship
grew
like
a
tree
.
She
was
SUCH
a
*NL*
good
sport
!
We
did
all
kinds
of
things
together
.
She
taught
me
games
and
*NL*
I
taught
her
games
,
and
we
raced
and
rowed
and
had
all
manner
of
fun
,
as
*NL*
well
as
higher
comradeship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
I
got
on
farther
,
the
palace
and
treasures
and
snowy
mountain
*NL*
ranges
opened
up
.
I
had
never
known
there
could
be
such
a
human
being
.
*NL*
So
--
great
.
I
do
n't
mean
talented
.
She
was
a
forester
--
one
of
the
*NL*
best
--
but
it
was
not
that
gift
I
mean
.
When
I
say
GREAT
,
I
mean
*NL*
great
--
big
,
all
through
.
If
I
had
known
more
of
those
women
,
as
*NL*
intimately
,
I
should
not
have
found
her
so
unique
;
but
even
among
them
*NL*
she
was
noble
.
Her
mother
was
an
Over
Mother
--
and
her
grandmother
,
too
,
*NL*
I
heard
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
told
me
more
and
more
of
her
beautiful
land
;
and
I
told
her
as
*NL*
much
,
yes
,
more
than
I
wanted
to
,
about
mine
;
and
we
became
inseparable
.
*NL*
Then
this
deeper
recognition
came
and
grew
.
I
felt
my
own
soul
rise
*NL*
and
lift
its
wings
,
as
it
were
.
Life
got
bigger
.
It
seemed
as
if
I
*NL*
understood
--
as
I
never
had
before
--
as
if
I
could
Do
things
--
as
if
I
too
*NL*
could
grow
--
if
she
would
help
me
.
And
then
It
came
--
to
both
of
us
,
all
*NL*
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
still
day
--
on
the
edge
of
the
world
,
their
world
.
The
two
of
us
,
*NL*
gazing
out
over
the
far
dim
forestland
below
,
talking
of
heaven
and
*NL*
earth
and
human
life
,
and
of
my
land
and
other
lands
and
what
they
*NL*
needed
and
what
I
hoped
to
do
for
them
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
help
me
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
me
,
with
that
high
,
sweet
look
of
hers
,
and
then
,
as
her
*NL*
eyes
rested
in
mine
and
her
hands
too
--
then
suddenly
there
blazed
out
*NL*
between
us
a
farther
glory
,
instant
,
overwhelming
--
quite
beyond
any
*NL*
words
of
mine
to
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Celis
was
a
blue-and-gold-and-rose
person
;
Alma
,
*NL*
black-and-white-and-red
,
a
blazing
beauty
.
Ellador
was
brown
:
hair
dark
*NL*
and
soft
,
like
a
seal
coat
;
clear
brown
skin
with
a
healthy
red
in
*NL*
it
;
brown
eyes
--
all
the
way
from
topaz
to
black
velvet
they
seemed
to
*NL*
range
--
splendid
girls
,
all
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
seen
us
first
of
all
,
far
down
in
the
lake
below
,
and
flashed
*NL*
the
tidings
across
the
land
even
before
our
first
exploring
flight
.
They
*NL*
had
watched
our
landing
,
flitted
through
the
forest
with
us
,
hidden
in
*NL*
that
tree
and
--
I
shrewdly
suspect
--
giggled
on
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
kept
watch
over
our
hooded
machine
,
taking
turns
at
it
;
and
*NL*
when
our
escape
was
announced
,
had
followed
along-side
for
a
day
or
two
,
*NL*
and
been
there
at
the
last
,
as
described
.
They
felt
a
special
claim
on
*NL*
us
--
called
us
``
their
men
''
--
and
when
we
were
at
liberty
to
study
the
land
*NL*
and
people
,
and
be
studied
by
them
,
their
claim
was
recognized
by
the
*NL*
wise
leaders
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
felt
,
we
all
did
,
that
we
should
have
chosen
them
among
millions
,
*NL*
unerringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
``
the
path
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
''
;
this
period
of
*NL*
courtship
was
full
of
the
most
unsuspected
pitfalls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Writing
this
as
late
as
I
do
,
after
manifold
experiences
both
in
Herland
*NL*
and
,
later
,
in
my
own
land
,
I
can
now
understand
and
philosophize
about
*NL*
what
was
then
a
continual
astonishment
and
often
a
temporary
tragedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
long
suit
''
in
most
courtships
is
sex
attraction
,
of
course
.
Then
*NL*
gradually
develops
such
comradeship
as
the
two
temperaments
allow
.
Then
,
*NL*
after
marriage
,
there
is
either
the
establishment
of
a
slow-growing
,
*NL*
widely
based
friendship
,
the
deepest
,
tenderest
,
sweetest
of
relations
,
*NL*
all
lit
and
warmed
by
the
recurrent
flame
of
love
;
or
else
that
process
*NL*
is
reversed
,
love
cools
and
fades
,
no
friendship
grows
,
the
whole
*NL*
relation
turns
from
beauty
to
ashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
everything
was
different
.
There
was
no
sex-feeling
to
appeal
to
,
or
*NL*
practically
none
.
Two
thousand
years
'
disuse
had
left
very
little
of
the
*NL*
instinct
;
also
we
must
remember
that
those
who
had
at
times
manifested
*NL*
it
as
atavistic
exceptions
were
often
,
by
that
very
fact
,
denied
*NL*
motherhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
while
the
mother
process
remains
,
the
inherent
ground
for
*NL*
sex-distinction
remains
also
;
and
who
shall
say
what
long-forgotten
*NL*
feeling
,
vague
and
nameless
,
was
stirred
in
some
of
these
mother
hearts
*NL*
by
our
arrival
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
left
us
even
more
at
sea
in
our
approach
was
the
lack
of
any
*NL*
sex-tradition
.
There
was
no
accepted
standard
of
what
was
``
manly
''
and
*NL*
what
was
``
womanly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jeff
said
,
taking
the
fruit
basket
from
his
adored
one
,
``
A
woman
*NL*
should
not
carry
anything
,
''
Celis
said
,
``
Why
?
''
with
the
frankest
*NL*
amazement
.
He
could
not
look
that
fleet-footed
,
deep-chested
young
*NL*
forester
in
the
face
and
say
,
``
Because
she
is
weaker
.
''
She
was
n't
.
One
*NL*
does
not
call
a
race
horse
weak
because
it
is
visibly
not
a
cart
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
rather
lamely
,
that
women
were
not
built
for
heavy
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
out
across
the
fields
to
where
some
women
were
working
,
*NL*
building
a
new
bit
of
wall
out
of
large
stones
;
looked
back
at
the
*NL*
nearest
town
with
its
woman-built
houses
;
down
at
the
smooth
,
hard
road
*NL*
we
were
walking
on
;
and
then
at
the
little
basket
he
had
taken
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
she
said
quite
sweetly
.
``
Are
the
women
in
your
*NL*
country
so
weak
that
they
could
not
carry
such
a
thing
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
convention
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
assume
that
motherhood
is
a
*NL*
sufficient
burden
--
that
men
should
carry
all
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
beautiful
feeling
!
''
she
said
,
her
blue
eyes
shining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
work
?
''
asked
Alima
,
in
her
keen
,
swift
way
.
``
Do
all
men
in
all
*NL*
countries
carry
everything
?
Or
is
it
only
in
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
so
literal
,
''
Terry
begged
lazily
.
``
Why
are
n't
you
willing
to
*NL*
be
worshipped
and
waited
on
?
We
like
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
like
to
have
us
do
it
to
you
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
different
,
''
he
said
,
annoyed
;
and
when
she
said
,
``
Why
is
it
?
''
he
*NL*
quite
sulked
,
referring
her
to
me
,
saying
,
``
Van
's
the
philosopher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ellador
and
I
talked
it
all
out
together
,
so
that
we
had
an
easier
*NL*
experience
of
it
when
the
real
miracle
time
came
.
Also
,
between
us
,
we
*NL*
made
things
clearer
to
Jeff
and
Celis
.
But
Terry
would
not
listen
to
*NL*
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
madly
in
love
with
Alima
.
He
wanted
to
take
her
by
storm
,
and
*NL*
nearly
lost
her
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
if
a
man
loves
a
girl
who
is
in
the
first
place
young
and
*NL*
inexperienced
;
who
in
the
second
place
is
educated
with
a
background
*NL*
of
caveman
tradition
,
a
middle-ground
of
poetry
and
romance
,
and
a
*NL*
foreground
of
unspoken
hope
and
interest
all
centering
upon
the
one
*NL*
Event
;
and
who
has
,
furthermore
,
absolutely
no
other
hope
or
interest
*NL*
worthy
of
the
name
--
why
,
it
is
a
comparatively
easy
matter
to
sweep
*NL*
her
off
her
feet
with
a
dashing
attack
.
Terry
was
a
past
master
in
this
*NL*
process
.
He
tried
it
here
,
and
Alima
was
so
affronted
,
so
repelled
,
that
*NL*
it
was
weeks
before
he
got
near
enough
to
try
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
coldly
she
denied
him
,
the
hotter
his
determination
;
he
was
*NL*
not
used
to
real
refusal
.
The
approach
of
flattery
she
dismissed
with
*NL*
laughter
,
gifts
and
such
``
attentions
''
we
could
not
bring
to
bear
,
pathos
*NL*
and
complaint
of
cruelty
stirred
only
a
reasoning
inquiry
.
It
took
Terry
*NL*
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
doubt
if
she
ever
accepted
her
strange
lover
as
fully
as
did
Celis
*NL*
and
Ellador
theirs
.
He
had
hurt
and
offended
her
too
often
;
there
were
*NL*
reservations
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
think
Alima
retained
some
faint
vestige
of
long-descended
feeling
*NL*
which
made
Terry
more
possible
to
her
than
to
others
;
and
that
she
had
*NL*
made
up
her
mind
to
the
experiment
and
hated
to
renounce
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
it
came
about
,
we
all
three
at
length
achieved
full
*NL*
understanding
,
and
solemnly
faced
what
was
to
them
a
step
of
measureless
*NL*
importance
,
a
grave
question
as
well
as
a
great
happiness
;
to
us
a
*NL*
strange
,
new
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
marriage
as
a
ceremony
they
knew
nothing
.
Jeff
was
for
bringing
them
*NL*
to
our
country
for
the
religious
and
the
civil
ceremony
,
but
neither
*NL*
Celis
nor
the
others
would
consent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't
expect
them
to
want
to
go
with
us
--
yet
,
''
said
Terry
sagely
.
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
,
boys
.
We
've
got
to
take
'em
on
their
own
terms
--
if
at
all
.
''
*NL*
This
,
in
rueful
reminiscence
of
his
repeated
failures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
our
time
's
coming
,
''
he
added
cheerfully

``
These
women
have
never
*NL*
been
mastered
,
you
see
--
''
This
,
as
one
who
had
made
a
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
not
try
to
do
any
mastering
if
you
value
your
chances
,
''
*NL*
I
told
him
seriously
;
but
he
only
laughed
,
and
said
,
``
Every
man
to
his
*NL*
trade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
could
n't
do
anything
with
him
.
He
had
to
take
his
own
medicine
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
lack
of
tradition
of
courtship
left
us
much
at
sea
in
our
*NL*
wooing
,
we
found
ourselves
still
more
bewildered
by
lack
of
tradition
of
*NL*
matrimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
again
,
I
have
to
draw
on
later
experience
,
and
as
deep
an
*NL*
acquaintance
with
their
culture
as
I
could
achieve
,
to
explain
the
gulfs
*NL*
of
difference
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
thousand
years
of
one
continuous
culture
with
no
men
.
Back
of
that
,
*NL*
only
traditions
of
the
harem
.
They
had
no
exact
analogue
for
our
word
*NL*
HOME
,
any
more
than
they
had
for
our
Roman-based
FAMILY
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
loved
one
another
with
a
practically
universal
affection
,
rising
*NL*
to
exquisite
and
unbroken
friendships
,
and
broadening
to
a
devotion
to
*NL*
their
country
and
people
for
which
our
word
PATRIOTISM
is
no
definition
*NL*
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Patriotism
,
red
hot
,
is
compatible
with
the
existence
of
a
neglect
of
*NL*
national
interests
,
a
dishonesty
,
a
cold
indifference
to
the
*NL*
suffering
of
millions
.
Patriotism
is
largely
pride
,
and
very
largely
*NL*
combativeness
.
Patriotism
generally
has
a
chip
on
its
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
country
had
no
other
country
to
measure
itself
by
--
save
the
few
*NL*
poor
savages
far
below
,
with
whom
they
had
no
contact
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
loved
their
country
because
it
was
their
nursery
,
playground
,
*NL*
and
workshop
--
theirs
and
their
children
's
.
They
were
proud
of
it
as
a
*NL*
workshop
,
proud
of
their
record
of
ever-increasing
efficiency
;
they
had
*NL*
made
a
pleasant
garden
of
it
,
a
very
practical
little
heaven
;
but
most
*NL*
of
all
they
valued
it
--
and
here
it
is
hard
for
us
to
understand
them
--
as
*NL*
a
cultural
environment
for
their
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
,
of
course
,
is
the
keynote
of
the
whole
distinction
--
their
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
those
first
breathlessly
guarded
,
half-adored
race
mothers
,
all
*NL*
up
the
ascending
line
,
they
had
this
dominant
thought
of
building
up
a
*NL*
great
race
through
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
surrendering
devotion
our
women
have
put
into
their
private
*NL*
families
,
these
women
put
into
their
country
and
race
.
All
the
loyalty
*NL*
and
service
men
expect
of
wives
,
they
gave
,
not
singly
to
men
,
but
*NL*
collectively
to
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
mother
instinct
,
with
us
so
painfully
intense
,
so
thwarted
by
*NL*
conditions
,
so
concentrated
in
personal
devotion
to
a
few
,
so
bitterly
*NL*
hurt
by
death
,
disease
,
or
barrenness
,
and
even
by
the
mere
growth
*NL*
of
the
children
,
leaving
the
mother
alone
in
her
empty
nest
--
all
this
*NL*
feeling
with
them
flowed
out
in
a
strong
,
wide
current
,
unbroken
through
*NL*
the
generations
,
deepening
and
widening
through
the
years
,
including
*NL*
every
child
in
all
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
their
united
power
and
wisdom
,
they
had
studied
and
overcome
the
*NL*
``
diseases
of
childhood
''
--
their
children
had
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
faced
the
problems
of
education
and
so
solved
them
that
their
*NL*
children
grew
up
as
naturally
as
young
trees
;
learning
through
every
*NL*
sense
;
taught
continuously
but
unconsciously
--
never
knowing
they
were
*NL*
being
educated
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
they
did
not
use
the
word
as
we
do
.
Their
idea
of
education
was
*NL*
the
special
training
they
took
,
when
half
grown
up
,
under
experts
.
Then
*NL*
the
eager
young
minds
fairly
flung
themselves
on
their
chosen
subjects
,
*NL*
and
acquired
with
an
ease
,
a
breadth
,
a
grasp
,
at
which
I
never
ceased
*NL*
to
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
babies
and
little
children
never
felt
the
pressure
of
that
*NL*
``
forcible
feeding
''
of
the
mind
that
we
call
``
education
.

CHAPTER
9
.
Our
Relations
and
Theirs
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
'm
trying
to
show
here
is
that
with
these
women
the
whole
*NL*
relationship
of
life
counted
in
a
glad
,
eager
growing-up
to
join
the
*NL*
ranks
of
workers
in
the
line
best
loved
;
a
deep
,
tender
reverence
for
*NL*
one
's
own
mother
--
too
deep
for
them
to
speak
of
freely
--
and
beyond
that
,
*NL*
the
whole
,
free
,
wide
range
of
sisterhood
,
the
splendid
service
of
the
*NL*
country
,
and
friendships
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
these
women
we
came
,
filled
with
the
ideas
,
convictions
,
traditions
,
*NL*
of
our
culture
,
and
undertook
to
rouse
in
them
the
emotions
which
--
to
*NL*
us
--
seemed
proper
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
much
,
or
little
,
of
true
sex-feeling
there
was
between
us
,
it
*NL*
phrased
itself
in
their
minds
in
terms
of
friendship
,
the
one
purely
*NL*
personal
love
they
knew
,
and
of
ultimate
parentage
.
Visibly
we
were
not
*NL*
mothers
,
nor
children
,
nor
compatriots
;
so
,
if
they
loved
us
,
we
must
be
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
we
should
pair
off
together
in
our
courting
days
was
natural
to
*NL*
them
;
that
we
three
should
remain
much
together
,
as
they
did
themselves
,
*NL*
was
also
natural
.
We
had
as
yet
no
work
,
so
we
hung
about
them
in
their
*NL*
forest
tasks
;
that
was
natural
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
we
began
to
talk
about
each
couple
having
``
homes
''
of
our
own
,
*NL*
they
could
not
understand
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
work
takes
us
all
around
the
country
,
''
explained
Celis
.
``
We
can
not
*NL*
live
in
one
place
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
together
now
,
''
urged
Alima
,
looking
proudly
at
Terry
's
stalwart
*NL*
nearness
.
-LRB-
This
was
one
of
the
times
when
they
were
``
on
,
''
though
*NL*
presently
``
off
''
again
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
same
thing
at
all
,
''
he
insisted
.
``
A
man
wants
a
home
of
*NL*
his
own
,
with
his
wife
and
family
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Staying
in
it
?
All
the
time
?
''
asked
Ellador
.
``
Not
imprisoned
,
surely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
!
Living
there
--
naturally
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
she
do
there
--
all
the
time
?
''
Alima
demanded
.
``
What
is
her
*NL*
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Terry
patiently
explained
again
that
our
women
did
not
work
--
with
*NL*
reservations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
they
do
--
if
they
have
no
work
?
''
she
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
take
care
of
the
home
--
and
the
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
same
time
?
''
asked
Ellador
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
yes
.
The
children
play
about
,
and
the
mother
has
charge
of
it
all
.
*NL*
There
are
servants
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
so
obvious
,
so
natural
to
Terry
,
that
he
always
grew
*NL*
impatient
;
but
the
girls
were
honestly
anxious
to
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
children
do
your
women
have
?
''
Alima
had
her
notebook
out
now
,
*NL*
and
a
rather
firm
set
of
lip
.
Terry
began
to
dodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
set
number
,
my
dear
,
''
he
explained
.
``
Some
have
more
,
some
*NL*
have
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
have
none
at
all
,
''
I
put
in
mischievously
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
pounced
on
this
admission
and
soon
wrung
from
us
the
general
fact
*NL*
that
those
women
who
had
the
most
children
had
the
least
servants
,
and
*NL*
those
who
had
the
most
servants
had
the
least
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
triumphed
Alima
.
``
One
or
two
or
no
children
,
and
three
or
four
*NL*
servants
.
Now
what
do
those
women
DO
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
explained
as
best
we
might
.
We
talked
of
``
social
duties
,
''
*NL*
disingenuously
banking
on
their
not
interpreting
the
words
as
we
did
;
we
*NL*
talked
of
hospitality
,
entertainment
,
and
various
``
interests
.
''
All
the
*NL*
time
we
knew
that
to
these
large-minded
women
whose
whole
mental
outlook
*NL*
was
so
collective
,
the
limitations
of
a
wholly
personal
life
were
*NL*
inconceivable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
not
really
understand
it
,
''
Ellador
concluded
.
``
We
are
only
half
*NL*
a
people
.
We
have
our
woman-ways
and
they
have
their
man-ways
and
their
*NL*
both-ways
.
We
have
worked
out
a
system
of
living
which
is
,
of
course
,
*NL*
limited
.
They
must
have
a
broader
,
richer
,
better
one
.
I
should
like
to
*NL*
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
,
dearest
,
''
I
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
smoke
,
''
complained
Terry
.
He
was
in
the
midst
of
a
*NL*
prolonged
quarrel
with
Alima
,
and
needed
a
sedative
.
``
There
's
nothing
to
*NL*
drink
.
These
blessed
women
have
no
pleasant
vices
.
I
wish
we
could
get
*NL*
out
of
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
wish
was
vain
.
We
were
always
under
a
certain
degree
of
*NL*
watchfulness
.
When
Terry
burst
forth
to
tramp
the
streets
at
night
he
*NL*
always
found
a
``
Colonel
''
here
or
there
;
and
when
,
on
an
occasion
of
*NL*
fierce
though
temporary
despair
,
he
had
plunged
to
the
cliff
edge
with
*NL*
some
vague
view
to
escape
,
he
found
several
of
them
close
by
.
We
were
*NL*
free
--
but
there
was
a
string
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
no
unpleasant
ones
,
either
,
''
Jeff
reminded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wish
they
had
!
''
Terry
persisted
.
``
They
've
neither
the
vices
of
men
,
nor
*NL*
the
virtues
of
women
--
they
're
neuters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
better
than
that
.
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
,
''
said
I
,
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
thinking
of
Ellador
's
eyes
when
they
gave
me
a
certain
look
,
a
*NL*
look
she
did
not
at
all
realize
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
was
equally
incensed
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
`
virtues
of
women
'
you
*NL*
miss
.
Seems
to
me
they
have
all
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
no
modesty
,
''
snapped
Terry
.
``
No
patience
,
no
submissiveness
,
*NL*
none
of
that
natural
yielding
which
is
woman
's
greatest
charm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shook
my
head
pityingly
.
``
Go
and
apologize
and
make
friends
again
,
*NL*
Terry
.
You
've
got
a
grouch
,
that
's
all
.
These
women
have
the
virtue
*NL*
of
humanity
,
with
less
of
its
faults
than
any
folks
I
ever
saw
.
As
for
*NL*
patience
--
they
'd
have
pitched
us
over
the
cliffs
the
first
day
we
lit
*NL*
among
'em
,
if
they
had
n't
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
no
--
distractions
,
''
he
grumbled
.
``
Nowhere
a
man
can
go
and
cut
*NL*
loose
a
bit
.
It
's
an
everlasting
parlor
and
nursery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
workshop
,
''
I
added
.
``
And
school
,
and
office
,
and
laboratory
,
and
*NL*
studio
,
and
theater
,
and
--
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
HOME
!
''
he
sneered
.
``
There
is
n't
a
home
in
the
whole
pitiful
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
n't
anything
else
,
and
you
know
it
,
''
Jeff
retorted
hotly
.
``
I
*NL*
never
saw
,
I
never
dreamed
of
,
such
universal
peace
and
good
will
and
*NL*
mutual
affection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
of
course
,
if
you
like
a
perpetual
Sunday
school
,
it
's
all
*NL*
very
well
.
But
I
like
Something
Doing
.
Here
it
's
all
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
to
this
criticism
.
The
years
of
pioneering
lay
far
*NL*
behind
them
.
Theirs
was
a
civilization
in
which
the
initial
difficulties
*NL*
had
long
since
been
overcome
.
The
untroubled
peace
,
the
unmeasured
*NL*
plenty
,
the
steady
health
,
the
large
good
will
and
smooth
management
*NL*
which
ordered
everything
,
left
nothing
to
overcome
.
It
was
like
a
*NL*
pleasant
family
in
an
old
established
,
perfectly
run
country
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
liked
it
because
of
my
eager
and
continued
interest
in
the
*NL*
sociological
achievements
involved
.
Jeff
liked
it
as
he
would
have
liked
*NL*
such
a
family
and
such
a
place
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
did
not
like
it
because
he
found
nothing
to
oppose
,
to
struggle
*NL*
with
,
to
conquer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Life
is
a
struggle
,
has
to
be
,
''
he
insisted
.
``
If
there
is
no
struggle
,
*NL*
there
is
no
life
--
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
talking
nonsense
--
masculine
nonsense
,
''
the
peaceful
Jeff
*NL*
replied
.
He
was
certainly
a
warm
defender
of
Herland
.
``
Ants
do
n't
raise
*NL*
their
myriads
by
a
struggle
,
do
they
?
Or
the
bees
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
go
back
to
insects
--
and
want
to
live
in
an
anthill
--
!
I
tell
*NL*
you
the
higher
grades
of
life
are
reached
only
through
struggle
--
combat
.
*NL*
There
's
no
Drama
here
.
Look
at
their
plays
!
They
make
me
sick

He
rather
had
us
there
.
The
drama
of
the
country
was
--
to
our
*NL*
taste
--
rather
flat
.
You
see
,
they
lacked
the
sex
motive
and
,
with
it
,
*NL*
jealousy
.
They
had
no
interplay
of
warring
nations
,
no
aristocracy
and
*NL*
its
ambitions
,
no
wealth
and
poverty
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
I
have
said
little
about
the
economics
of
the
place
;
it
should
*NL*
have
come
before
,
but
I
'll
go
on
about
the
drama
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
their
own
kind
.
There
was
a
most
impressive
array
of
pageantry
,
*NL*
of
processions
,
a
sort
of
grand
ritual
,
with
their
arts
and
their
*NL*
religion
broadly
blended
.
The
very
babies
joined
in
it
.
To
see
one
of
*NL*
their
great
annual
festivals
,
with
the
massed
and
marching
stateliness
*NL*
of
those
great
mothers
,
the
young
women
brave
and
noble
,
beautiful
and
*NL*
strong
;
and
then
the
children
,
taking
part
as
naturally
as
ours
would
*NL*
frolic
round
a
Christmas
tree
--
it
was
overpowering
in
the
impression
of
*NL*
joyous
,
triumphant
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
begun
at
a
period
when
the
drama
,
the
dance
,
music
,
religion
,
*NL*
and
education
were
all
very
close
together
;
and
instead
of
developing
*NL*
them
in
detached
lines
,
they
had
kept
the
connection
.
Let
me
try
again
*NL*
to
give
,
if
I
can
,
a
faint
sense
of
the
difference
in
the
life
view
--
the
*NL*
background
and
basis
on
which
their
culture
rested
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ellador
told
me
a
lot
about
it
.
She
took
me
to
see
the
children
,
the
*NL*
growing
girls
,
the
special
teachers
.
She
picked
out
books
for
me
to
*NL*
read
.
She
always
seemed
to
understand
just
what
I
wanted
to
know
,
and
*NL*
how
to
give
it
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Terry
and
Alima
struck
sparks
and
parted
--
he
always
madly
drawn
*NL*
to
her
and
she
to
him
--
she
must
have
been
,
or
she
'd
never
have
stood
the
*NL*
way
he
behaved
--
Ellador
and
I
had
already
a
deep
,
restful
feeling
,
as
*NL*
if
we
'd
always
had
one
another
.
Jeff
and
Celis
were
happy
;
there
was
no
*NL*
question
of
that
;
but
it
did
n't
seem
to
me
as
if
they
had
the
good
times
*NL*
we
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
here
is
the
Herland
child
facing
life
--
as
Ellador
tried
to
show
*NL*
it
to
me
.
From
the
first
memory
,
they
knew
Peace
,
Beauty
,
Order
,
Safety
,
*NL*
Love
,
Wisdom
,
Justice
,
Patience
,
and
Plenty
.
By
``
plenty
''
I
mean
that
the
*NL*
babies
grew
up
in
an
environment
which
met
their
needs
,
just
as
young
*NL*
fawns
might
grow
up
in
dewy
forest
glades
and
brook-fed
meadows
.
And
*NL*
they
enjoyed
it
as
frankly
and
utterly
as
the
fawns
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
themselves
in
a
big
bright
lovely
world
,
full
of
the
most
*NL*
interesting
and
enchanting
things
to
learn
about
and
to
do
.
The
people
*NL*
everywhere
were
friendly
and
polite
.
No
Herland
child
ever
met
the
*NL*
overbearing
rudeness
we
so
commonly
show
to
children
.
They
were
People
,
*NL*
too
,
from
the
first
;
the
most
precious
part
of
the
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
each
step
of
the
rich
experience
of
living
,
they
found
the
instance
*NL*
they
were
studying
widen
out
into
contact
with
an
endless
range
of
*NL*
common
interests
.
The
things
they
learned
were
RELATED
,
from
the
first
;
*NL*
related
to
one
another
,
and
to
the
national
prosperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
butterfly
that
made
me
a
forester
,
''
said
Ellador
.
``
I
was
about
*NL*
eleven
years
old
,
and
I
found
a
big
purple-and-green
butterfly
on
a
low
*NL*
flower
.
I
caught
it
,
very
carefully
,
by
the
closed
wings
,
as
I
had
been
*NL*
told
to
do
,
and
carried
it
to
the
nearest
insect
teacher
''
--
I
made
a
note
*NL*
there
to
ask
her
what
on
earth
an
insect
teacher
was
--
``
to
ask
her
its
*NL*
name
.
She
took
it
from
me
with
a
little
cry
of
delight
.
`
Oh
,
you
blessed
*NL*
child
,
'
she
said
.
`
Do
you
like
obernuts
?
'
Of
course
I
liked
obernuts
,
*NL*
and
said
so
.
It
is
our
best
food-nut
,
you
know
.
`
This
is
a
female
of
the
*NL*
obernut
moth
,
'
she
told
me
.
`
They
are
almost
gone
.
We
have
been
trying
*NL*
to
exterminate
them
for
centuries
.
If
you
had
not
caught
this
one
,
it
*NL*
might
have
laid
eggs
enough
to
raise
worms
enough
to
destroy
thousands
*NL*
of
our
nut
trees
--
thousands
of
bushels
of
nuts
--
and
make
years
and
years
*NL*
of
trouble
for
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
congratulated
me
.
The
children
all
over
the
country
were
told
*NL*
to
watch
for
that
moth
,
if
there
were
any
more
.
I
was
shown
the
history
*NL*
of
the
creature
,
and
an
account
of
the
damage
it
used
to
do
and
of
how
*NL*
long
and
hard
our
foremothers
had
worked
to
save
that
tree
for
us
.
I
*NL*
grew
a
foot
,
it
seemed
to
me
,
and
determined
then
and
there
to
be
a
*NL*
forester
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
but
an
instance
;
she
showed
me
many
.
The
big
difference
was
that
*NL*
whereas
our
children
grow
up
in
private
homes
and
families
,
with
every
*NL*
effort
made
to
protect
and
seclude
them
from
a
dangerous
world
,
here
*NL*
they
grew
up
in
a
wide
,
friendly
world
,
and
knew
it
for
theirs
,
from
the
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
child-literature
was
a
wonderful
thing
.
I
could
have
spent
years
*NL*
following
the
delicate
subtleties
,
the
smooth
simplicities
with
which
*NL*
they
had
bent
that
great
art
to
the
service
of
the
child
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
two
life
cycles
:
the
man
's
and
the
woman
's
.
To
the
man
there
is
*NL*
growth
,
struggle
,
conquest
,
the
establishment
of
his
family
,
and
as
much
*NL*
further
success
in
gain
or
ambition
as
he
can
achieve
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
woman
,
growth
,
the
securing
of
a
husband
,
the
subordinate
*NL*
activities
of
family
life
,
and
afterward
such
``
social
''
or
charitable
*NL*
interests
as
her
position
allows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
but
one
cycle
,
and
that
a
large
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
entered
upon
a
broad
open
field
of
life
,
in
which
motherhood
*NL*
was
the
one
great
personal
contribution
to
the
national
life
,
and
all
*NL*
the
rest
the
individual
share
in
their
common
activities
.
Every
girl
I
*NL*
talked
to
,
at
any
age
above
babyhood
,
had
her
cheerful
determination
as
*NL*
to
what
she
was
going
to
be
when
she
grew
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Terry
meant
by
saying
they
had
no
``
modesty
''
was
that
this
great
*NL*
life-view
had
no
shady
places
;
they
had
a
high
sense
of
personal
*NL*
decorum
,
but
no
shame
--
no
knowledge
of
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
their
shortcomings
and
misdeeds
in
childhood
never
were
presented
*NL*
to
them
as
sins
;
merely
as
errors
and
misplays
--
as
in
a
game
.
Some
of
*NL*
them
,
who
were
palpably
less
agreeable
than
others
or
who
had
a
real
*NL*
weakness
or
fault
,
were
treated
with
cheerful
allowance
,
as
a
friendly
*NL*
group
at
whist
would
treat
a
poor
player
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
religion
,
you
see
,
was
maternal
;
and
their
ethics
,
based
on
the
*NL*
full
perception
of
evolution
,
showed
the
principle
of
growth
and
the
*NL*
beauty
of
wise
culture
.
They
had
no
theory
of
the
essential
opposition
*NL*
of
good
and
evil
;
life
to
them
was
growth
;
their
pleasure
was
in
*NL*
growing
,
and
their
duty
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
background
,
with
their
sublimated
mother-love
,
expressed
in
*NL*
terms
of
widest
social
activity
,
every
phase
of
their
work
was
modified
*NL*
by
its
effect
on
the
national
growth
.
The
language
itself
they
had
*NL*
deliberately
clarified
,
simplified
,
made
easy
and
beautiful
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
to
us
a
wholly
incredible
thing
:
first
,
that
any
nation
*NL*
should
have
the
foresight
,
the
strength
,
and
the
persistence
to
plan
*NL*
and
fulfill
such
a
task
;
and
second
,
that
women
should
have
had
so
much
*NL*
initiative
.
We
have
assumed
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
women
had
*NL*
none
;
that
only
the
man
,
with
his
natural
energy
and
impatience
of
*NL*
restriction
,
would
ever
invent
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
we
found
that
the
pressure
of
life
upon
the
environment
develops
in
*NL*
the
human
mind
its
inventive
reactions
,
regardless
of
sex
;
and
further
,
*NL*
that
a
fully
awakened
motherhood
plans
and
works
without
limit
,
for
the
*NL*
good
of
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
children
might
be
most
nobly
born
,
and
reared
in
an
environment
*NL*
calculated
to
allow
the
richest
,
freest
growth
,
they
had
deliberately
*NL*
remodeled
and
improved
the
whole
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
mean
in
the
least
that
they
stopped
at
that
,
any
more
than
*NL*
a
child
stops
at
childhood
.
The
most
impressive
part
of
their
whole
*NL*
culture
beyond
this
perfect
system
of
child-rearing
was
the
range
of
*NL*
interests
and
associations
open
to
them
all
,
for
life
.
But
in
the
field
*NL*
of
literature
I
was
most
struck
,
at
first
,
by
the
child-motive
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
the
same
gradation
of
simple
repetitive
verse
and
story
that
we
*NL*
are
familiar
with
,
and
the
most
exquisite
,
imaginative
tales
;
but
where
,
*NL*
with
us
,
these
are
the
dribbled
remnants
of
ancient
folk
myths
and
*NL*
primitive
lullabies
,
theirs
were
the
exquisite
work
of
great
artists
;
*NL*
not
only
simple
and
unfailing
in
appeal
to
the
child-mind
,
but
TRUE
,
*NL*
true
to
the
living
world
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
sit
in
one
of
their
nurseries
for
a
day
was
to
change
one
's
views
*NL*
forever
as
to
babyhood
.
The
youngest
ones
,
rosy
fatlings
in
their
*NL*
mothers
'
arms
,
or
sleeping
lightly
in
the
flower-sweet
air
,
seemed
*NL*
natural
enough
,
save
that
they
never
cried
.
I
never
heard
a
child
cry
in
*NL*
Herland
,
save
once
or
twice
at
a
bad
fall
;
and
then
people
ran
to
help
,
*NL*
as
we
would
at
a
scream
of
agony
from
a
grown
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
mother
had
her
year
of
glory
;
the
time
to
love
and
learn
,
living
*NL*
closely
with
her
child
,
nursing
it
proudly
,
often
for
two
years
or
more
.
*NL*
This
perhaps
was
one
reason
for
their
wonderful
vigor
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
the
baby-year
the
mother
was
not
so
constantly
in
attendance
,
*NL*
unless
,
indeed
,
her
work
was
among
the
little
ones
.
She
was
never
*NL*
far
off
,
however
,
and
her
attitude
toward
the
co-mothers
,
whose
proud
*NL*
child-service
was
direct
and
continuous
,
was
lovely
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
babies
--
a
group
of
those
naked
darlings
playing
on
short
*NL*
velvet
grass
,
clean-swept
;
or
rugs
as
soft
;
or
in
shallow
pools
of
*NL*
bright
water
;
tumbling
over
with
bubbling
joyous
baby
laughter
--
it
was
a
*NL*
view
of
infant
happiness
such
as
I
had
never
dreamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
babies
were
reared
in
the
warmer
part
of
the
country
,
and
gradually
*NL*
acclimated
to
the
cooler
heights
as
they
grew
older
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sturdy
children
of
ten
and
twelve
played
in
the
snow
as
joyfully
as
ours
*NL*
do
;
there
were
continuous
excursions
of
them
,
from
one
part
of
the
land
*NL*
to
another
,
so
that
to
each
child
the
whole
country
might
be
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
theirs
,
waiting
for
them
to
learn
,
to
love
,
to
use
,
to
serve
;
*NL*
as
our
own
little
boys
plan
to
be
``
a
big
soldier
,
''
or
``
a
cowboy
,
''
or
*NL*
whatever
pleases
their
fancy
;
and
our
little
girls
plan
for
the
kind
of
*NL*
home
they
mean
to
have
,
or
how
many
children
;
these
planned
,
freely
and
*NL*
gaily
with
much
happy
chattering
,
of
what
they
would
do
for
the
country
*NL*
when
they
were
grown
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
eager
happiness
of
the
children
and
young
people
which
first
*NL*
made
me
see
the
folly
of
that
common
notion
of
ours
--
that
if
life
was
*NL*
smooth
and
happy
,
people
would
not
enjoy
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
studied
these
youngsters
,
vigorous
,
joyous
,
eager
little
creatures
,
*NL*
and
their
voracious
appetite
for
life
,
it
shook
my
previous
ideas
so
*NL*
thoroughly
that
they
have
never
been
re-established
.
The
steady
level
of
*NL*
good
health
gave
them
all
that
natural
stimulus
we
used
to
call
``
animal
*NL*
spirits
''
--
an
odd
contradiction
in
terms
.
They
found
themselves
in
an
*NL*
immediate
environment
which
was
agreeable
and
interesting
,
and
before
*NL*
them
stretched
the
years
of
learning
and
discovery
,
the
fascinating
,
*NL*
endless
process
of
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
looked
into
these
methods
and
compared
them
with
our
own
,
my
*NL*
strange
uncomfortable
sense
of
race-humility
grew
apace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ellador
could
not
understand
my
astonishment
.
She
explained
things
*NL*
kindly
and
sweetly
,
but
with
some
amazement
that
they
needed
explaining
,
*NL*
and
with
sudden
questions
as
to
how
we
did
it
that
left
me
meeker
than
*NL*
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
betook
myself
to
Somel
one
day
,
carefully
not
taking
Ellador
.
I
did
*NL*
not
mind
seeming
foolish
to
Somel
--
she
was
used
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
a
chapter
of
explanation
,
''
I
told
her
.
``
You
know
my
stupidities
*NL*
by
heart
,
and
I
do
not
want
to
show
them
to
Ellador
--
she
thinks
me
so
*NL*
wise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
delightedly
.
``
It
is
beautiful
to
see
,
''
she
told
me
,
``
this
*NL*
new
wonderful
love
between
you
.
The
whole
country
is
interested
,
you
*NL*
know
--
how
can
we
help
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
thought
of
that
.
We
say
:
``
All
the
world
loves
a
lover
,
''
but
*NL*
to
have
a
couple
of
million
people
watching
one
's
courtship
--
and
that
a
*NL*
difficult
one
--
was
rather
embarrassing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
about
your
theory
of
education
,
''
I
said
.
``
Make
it
short
and
*NL*
easy
.
And
,
to
show
you
what
puzzles
me
,
I
'll
tell
you
that
in
our
theory
*NL*
great
stress
is
laid
on
the
forced
exertion
of
the
child
's
mind
;
we
*NL*
think
it
is
good
for
him
to
overcome
obstacles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
,
''
she
unexpectedly
agreed
.
``
All
our
children
do
*NL*
that
--
they
love
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
puzzled
me
again
.
If
they
loved
to
do
it
,
how
could
it
be
*NL*
educational
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
theory
is
this
,
''
she
went
on
carefully
.
``
Here
is
a
young
human
*NL*
being
.
The
mind
is
as
natural
a
thing
as
the
body
,
a
thing
that
grows
,
*NL*
a
thing
to
use
and
enjoy
.
We
seek
to
nourish
,
to
stimulate
,
to
exercise
*NL*
the
mind
of
a
child
as
we
do
the
body
.
There
are
the
two
main
divisions
*NL*
in
education
--
you
have
those
of
course
?
--
the
things
it
is
necessary
to
*NL*
know
,
and
the
things
it
is
necessary
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
do
?
Mental
exercises
,
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Our
general
plan
is
this
:
In
the
matter
of
feeding
the
mind
,
*NL*
of
furnishing
information
,
we
use
our
best
powers
to
meet
the
natural
*NL*
appetite
of
a
healthy
young
brain
;
not
to
overfeed
it
,
to
provide
such
*NL*
amount
and
variety
of
impressions
as
seem
most
welcome
to
each
child
.
*NL*
That
is
the
easiest
part
.
The
other
division
is
in
arranging
a
properly
*NL*
graduated
series
of
exercises
which
will
best
develop
each
mind
;
the
*NL*
common
faculties
we
all
have
,
and
most
carefully
,
the
especial
faculties
*NL*
some
of
us
have
.
You
do
this
also
,
do
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
way
,
''
I
said
rather
lamely
.
``
We
have
not
so
subtle
and
highly
*NL*
developed
a
system
as
you
,
not
approaching
it
;
but
tell
me
more
.
As
*NL*
to
the
information
--
how
do
you
manage
?
It
appears
that
all
of
you
know
*NL*
pretty
much
everything
--
is
that
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
she
laughingly
disclaimed
.
``
By
no
means
.
We
are
,
as
you
soon
found
*NL*
out
,
extremely
limited
in
knowledge
.
I
wish
you
could
realize
what
a
*NL*
ferment
the
country
is
in
over
the
new
things
you
have
told
us
;
the
*NL*
passionate
eagerness
among
thousands
of
us
to
go
to
your
country
and
*NL*
learn
--
learn
--
learn
!
But
what
we
do
know
is
readily
divisible
into
*NL*
common
knowledge
and
special
knowledge
.
The
common
knowledge
we
have
*NL*
long
since
learned
to
feed
into
the
minds
of
our
little
ones
with
no
*NL*
waste
of
time
or
strength
;
the
special
knowledge
is
open
to
all
,
as
*NL*
they
desire
it
.
Some
of
us
specialize
in
one
line
only
.
But
most
take
up
*NL*
several
--
some
for
their
regular
work
,
some
to
grow
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
grow
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
When
one
settles
too
close
in
one
kind
of
work
there
is
a
tendency
*NL*
to
atrophy
in
the
disused
portions
of
the
brain
.
We
like
to
keep
on
*NL*
learning
,
always
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
study
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
much
as
we
know
of
the
different
sciences

We
have
,
within
our
*NL*
limits
,
a
good
deal
of
knowledge
of
anatomy
,
physiology
,
nutrition
--
all
*NL*
that
pertains
to
a
full
and
beautiful
personal
life
.
We
have
our
botany
*NL*
and
chemistry
,
and
so
on
--
very
rudimentary
,
but
interesting
;
our
own
*NL*
history
,
with
its
accumulating
psychology
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
put
psychology
with
history

not
with
personal
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course

It
is
ours
;
it
is
among
and
between
us
,
and
it
changes
with
*NL*
the
succeeding
and
improving
generations
.
We
are
at
work
,
slowly
and
*NL*
carefully
,
developing
our
whole
people
along
these
lines
.
It
is
glorious
*NL*
work
--
splendid
!
To
see
the
thousands
of
babies
improving
,
showing
*NL*
stronger
clearer
minds
,
sweeter
dispositions
,
higher
capacities
--
do
n't
*NL*
you
find
it
so
in
your
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
evaded
flatly
.
I
remembered
the
cheerless
claim
that
the
human
*NL*
mind
was
no
better
than
in
its
earliest
period
of
savagery
,
only
better
*NL*
informed
--
a
statement
I
had
never
believed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
try
most
earnestly
for
two
powers
,
''
Somel
continued
.
``
The
two
that
*NL*
seem
to
us
basically
necessary
for
all
noble
life
:
a
clear
,
far-reaching
*NL*
judgment
,
and
a
strong
well-used
will
.
We
spend
our
best
efforts
,
all
*NL*
through
childhood
and
youth
,
in
developing
these
faculties
,
individual
*NL*
judgment
and
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
part
of
your
system
of
education
,
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
As
the
most
valuable
part
.
With
the
babies
,
as
you
may
have
*NL*
noticed
,
we
first
provide
an
environment
which
feeds
the
mind
without
*NL*
tiring
it
;
all
manner
of
simple
and
interesting
things
to
do
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
they
are
old
enough
to
do
them
;
physical
properties
,
of
course
,
come
*NL*
first
.
But
as
early
as
possible
,
going
very
carefully
,
not
to
tax
the
*NL*
mind
,
we
provide
choices
,
simple
choices
,
with
very
obvious
causes
and
*NL*
consequences
.
You
've
noticed
the
games
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
.
The
children
seemed
always
playing
something
;
or
else
,
sometimes
,
*NL*
engaged
in
peaceful
researches
of
their
own
.
I
had
wondered
at
first
*NL*
when
they
went
to
school
,
but
soon
found
that
they
never
did
--
to
their
*NL*
knowledge
.
It
was
all
education
but
no
schooling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
working
for
some
sixteen
hundred
years
,
devising
better
*NL*
and
better
games
for
children
,
''
continued
Somel
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
aghast
.
``
Devising
games
?
''
I
protested
.
``
Making
up
new
ones
,
you
*NL*
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
''
she
answered
.
``
Do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
remembered
the
kindergarten
,
and
the
``
material
''
devised
by
*NL*
Signora
Montessori
,
and
guardedly
replied
:
``
To
some
extent
.
''
But
most
*NL*
of
our
games
,
I
told
her
,
were
very
old
--
came
down
from
child
to
child
,
*NL*
along
the
ages
,
from
the
remote
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
their
effect
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Do
they
develop
the
faculties
*NL*
you
wish
to
encourage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
I
remembered
the
claims
made
by
the
advocates
of
``
sports
,
''
and
*NL*
again
replied
guardedly
that
that
was
,
in
part
,
the
theory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
the
children
LIKE
it
?
''
I
asked
.
``
Having
things
made
up
and
set
*NL*
before
them
that
way
?
Do
n't
they
want
the
old
games
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
see
the
children
,
''
she
answered
.
``
Are
yours
more
*NL*
contented
--
more
interested
--
happier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
thought
,
as
in
truth
I
never
had
thought
before
,
of
the
dull
,
*NL*
bored
children
I
had
seen
,
whining
;
``
What
can
I
do
now
?
''
;
of
the
little
*NL*
groups
and
gangs
hanging
about
;
of
the
value
of
some
one
strong
spirit
*NL*
who
possessed
initiative
and
would
``
start
something
''
;
of
the
children
's
*NL*
parties
and
the
onerous
duties
of
the
older
people
set
to
``
amuse
the
*NL*
children
''
;
also
of
that
troubled
ocean
of
misdirected
activity
we
call
*NL*
``
mischief
,
''
the
foolish
,
destructive
,
sometimes
evil
things
done
by
*NL*
unoccupied
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
grimly
.
``
I
do
n't
think
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Herland
child
was
born
not
only
into
a
world
carefully
prepared
,
*NL*
full
of
the
most
fascinating
materials
and
opportunities
to
learn
,
but
*NL*
into
the
society
of
plentiful
numbers
of
teachers
,
teachers
born
and
*NL*
trained
,
whose
business
it
was
to
accompany
the
children
along
that
,
to
*NL*
us
,
impossible
thing
--
the
royal
road
to
learning
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
mystery
in
their
methods
.
Being
adapted
to
children
it
was
*NL*
at
least
comprehensible
to
adults
.
I
spent
many
days
with
the
little
*NL*
ones
,
sometimes
with
Ellador
,
sometimes
without
,
and
began
to
feel
a
*NL*
crushing
pity
for
my
own
childhood
,
and
for
all
others
that
I
had
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
houses
and
gardens
planned
for
babies
had
in
them
nothing
to
*NL*
hurt
--
no
stairs
,
no
corners
,
no
small
loose
objects
to
swallow
,
no
*NL*
fire
--
just
a
babies
'
paradise
.
They
were
taught
,
as
rapidly
as
*NL*
feasible
,
to
use
and
control
their
own
bodies
,
and
never
did
I
see
such
*NL*
sure-footed
,
steady-handed
,
clear-headed
little
things
.
It
was
a
joy
*NL*
to
watch
a
row
of
toddlers
learning
to
walk
,
not
only
on
a
level
floor
,
*NL*
but
,
a
little
later
,
on
a
sort
of
rubber
rail
raised
an
inch
or
two
*NL*
above
the
soft
turf
or
heavy
rugs
,
and
falling
off
with
shrieks
of
*NL*
infant
joy
,
to
rush
back
to
the
end
of
the
line
and
try
again
.
Surely
we
*NL*
have
noticed
how
children
love
to
get
up
on
something
and
walk
along
it
!
*NL*
But
we
have
never
thought
to
provide
that
simple
and
inexhaustible
form
*NL*
of
amusement
and
physical
education
for
the
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
Water
they
had
,
of
course
,
and
could
swim
even
before
they
walked
.
If
I
*NL*
feared
at
first
the
effects
of
a
too
intensive
system
of
culture
,
that
*NL*
fear
was
dissipated
by
seeing
the
long
sunny
days
of
pure
physical
*NL*
merriment
and
natural
sleep
in
which
these
heavenly
babies
passed
their
*NL*
first
years
.
They
never
knew
they
were
being
educated
.
They
did
not
*NL*
dream
that
in
this
association
of
hilarious
experiment
and
achievement
*NL*
they
were
laying
the
foundation
for
that
close
beautiful
group
feeling
*NL*
into
which
they
grew
so
firmly
with
the
years
.
This
was
education
for
*NL*
citizenship
.

CHAPTER
10
.
Their
Religions
and
Our
Marriages
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
me
a
long
time
,
as
a
man
,
a
foreigner
,
and
a
species
*NL*
of
Christian
--
I
was
that
as
much
as
anything
--
to
get
any
clear
*NL*
understanding
of
the
religion
of
Herland
.
*NL*
*NL*
Its
deification
of
motherhood
was
obvious
enough
;
but
there
was
far
more
*NL*
to
it
than
that
;
or
,
at
least
,
than
my
first
interpretation
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
it
was
only
as
I
grew
to
love
Ellador
more
than
I
believed
*NL*
anyone
could
love
anybody
,
as
I
grew
faintly
to
appreciate
her
inner
*NL*
attitude
and
state
of
mind
,
that
I
began
to
get
some
glimpses
of
this
*NL*
faith
of
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
asked
her
about
it
,
she
tried
at
first
to
tell
me
,
and
then
,
*NL*
seeing
me
flounder
,
asked
for
more
information
about
ours
.
She
soon
*NL*
found
that
we
had
many
,
that
they
varied
widely
,
but
had
some
points
*NL*
in
common
.
A
clear
methodical
luminous
mind
had
my
Ellador
,
not
only
*NL*
reasonable
,
but
swiftly
perceptive
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
a
sort
of
chart
,
superimposing
the
different
religions
as
*NL*
I
described
them
,
with
a
pin
run
through
them
all
,
as
it
were
;
their
*NL*
common
basis
being
a
Dominant
Power
or
Powers
,
and
some
Special
*NL*
Behavior
,
mostly
taboos
,
to
please
or
placate
.
There
were
some
common
*NL*
features
in
certain
groups
of
religions
,
but
the
one
always
present
was
*NL*
this
Power
,
and
the
things
which
must
be
done
or
not
done
because
of
*NL*
it
.
It
was
not
hard
to
trace
our
human
imagery
of
the
Divine
Force
up
*NL*
through
successive
stages
of
bloodthirsty
,
sensual
,
proud
,
and
cruel
*NL*
gods
of
early
times
to
the
conception
of
a
Common
Father
with
its
*NL*
corollary
of
a
Common
Brotherhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
pleased
her
very
much
,
and
when
I
expatiated
on
the
Omniscience
,
*NL*
Omnipotence
,
Omnipresence
,
and
so
on
,
of
our
God
,
and
of
the
loving
*NL*
kindness
taught
by
his
Son
,
she
was
much
impressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
of
the
Virgin
birth
naturally
did
not
astonish
her
,
but
she
*NL*
was
greatly
puzzled
by
the
Sacrifice
,
and
still
more
by
the
Devil
,
and
*NL*
the
theory
of
Damnation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
in
an
inadvertent
moment
I
said
that
certain
sects
had
believed
in
*NL*
infant
damnation
--
and
explained
it
--
she
sat
very
still
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
believed
that
God
was
Love
--
and
Wisdom
--
and
Power
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
all
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
grew
large
,
her
face
ghastly
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
that
such
a
God
could
put
little
new
babies
to
burn
--
for
*NL*
eternity
?
''
She
fell
into
a
sudden
shuddering
and
left
me
,
running
*NL*
swiftly
to
the
nearest
temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
smallest
village
had
its
temple
,
and
in
those
gracious
retreats
*NL*
sat
wise
and
noble
women
,
quietly
busy
at
some
work
of
their
own
until
*NL*
they
were
wanted
,
always
ready
to
give
comfort
,
light
,
or
help
,
to
any
*NL*
applicant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ellador
told
me
afterward
how
easily
this
grief
of
hers
was
assuaged
,
*NL*
and
seemed
ashamed
of
not
having
helped
herself
out
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
we
are
not
accustomed
to
horrible
ideas
,
''
she
said
,
coming
*NL*
back
to
me
rather
apologetically
.
``
We
have
n't
any
.
And
when
we
get
a
*NL*
thing
like
that
into
our
minds
it
's
like
--
oh
,
like
red
pepper
in
your
*NL*
eyes
.
So
I
just
ran
to
her
,
blinded
and
almost
screaming
,
and
she
took
*NL*
it
out
so
quickly
--
so
easily
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
I
asked
,
very
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Why
,
you
blessed
child
,
'
she
said
,
`
you
've
got
the
wrong
idea
*NL*
altogether
.
You
do
not
have
to
think
that
there
ever
was
such
a
God
--
for
*NL*
there
was
n't
.
Or
such
a
happening
--
for
there
was
n't
.
Nor
even
that
this
*NL*
hideous
false
idea
was
believed
by
anybody
.
But
only
this
--
that
people
*NL*
who
are
utterly
ignorant
will
believe
anything
--
which
you
certainly
knew
*NL*
before
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
''
pursued
Ellador
,
``
she
turned
pale
for
a
minute
when
I
first
*NL*
said
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
lesson
to
me
.
No
wonder
this
whole
nation
of
women
was
*NL*
peaceful
and
sweet
in
expression
--
they
had
no
horrible
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
you
had
some
when
you
began
,
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
no
doubt
.
But
as
soon
as
our
religion
grew
to
any
height
at
*NL*
all
we
left
them
out
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
,
as
from
many
other
things
,
I
grew
to
see
what
I
finally
put
*NL*
in
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
no
respect
for
the
past
?
For
what
was
thought
and
believed
by
*NL*
your
foremothers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
''
she
said
.
``
Why
should
we
?
They
are
all
gone
.
They
knew
less
*NL*
than
we
do
.
If
we
are
not
beyond
them
,
we
are
unworthy
of
them
--
and
*NL*
unworthy
of
the
children
who
must
go
beyond
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
set
me
thinking
in
good
earnest
.
I
had
always
imagined
--
simply
from
*NL*
hearing
it
said
,
I
suppose
--
that
women
were
by
nature
conservative
.
Yet
*NL*
these
women
,
quite
unassisted
by
any
masculine
spirit
of
enterprise
,
had
*NL*
ignored
their
past
and
built
daringly
for
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ellador
watched
me
think
.
She
seemed
to
know
pretty
much
what
was
going
*NL*
on
in
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
because
we
began
in
a
new
way
,
I
suppose
.
All
our
folks
were
swept
*NL*
away
at
once
,
and
then
,
after
that
time
of
despair
,
came
those
wonder
*NL*
children
--
the
first
.
And
then
the
whole
breathless
hope
of
us
was
for
*NL*
THEIR
children
--
if
they
should
have
them
.
And
they
did
!
Then
there
was
*NL*
the
period
of
pride
and
triumph
till
we
grew
too
numerous
;
and
after
*NL*
that
,
when
it
all
came
down
to
one
child
apiece
,
we
began
to
really
*NL*
work
--
to
make
better
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
does
this
account
for
such
a
radical
difference
in
your
*NL*
religion
?
''
I
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
she
could
n't
talk
about
the
difference
very
intelligently
,
*NL*
not
being
familiar
with
other
religions
,
but
that
theirs
seemed
simple
*NL*
enough
.
Their
great
Mother
Spirit
was
to
them
what
their
own
motherhood
*NL*
was
--
only
magnified
beyond
human
limits
.
That
meant
that
they
*NL*
felt
beneath
and
behind
them
an
upholding
,
unfailing
,
serviceable
*NL*
love
--
perhaps
it
was
really
the
accumulated
mother-love
of
the
race
they
*NL*
felt
--
but
it
was
a
Power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
what
is
your
theory
of
worship
?
''
I
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worship
?
What
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
it
singularly
difficult
to
explain
.
This
Divine
Love
which
they
*NL*
felt
so
strongly
did
not
seem
to
ask
anything
of
them
--
``
any
more
than
*NL*
our
mothers
do
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
your
mothers
expect
honor
,
reverence
,
obedience
,
from
you
.
*NL*
You
have
to
do
things
for
your
mothers
,
surely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
she
insisted
,
smiling
,
shaking
her
soft
brown
hair
.
``
We
do
*NL*
things
FROM
our
mothers
--
not
FOR
them
.
We
do
n't
have
to
do
things
*NL*
FOR
them
--
they
do
n't
need
it
,
you
know
.
But
we
have
to
live
*NL*
on
--
splendidly
--
because
of
them
;
and
that
's
the
way
we
feel
about
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
meditated
again
.
I
thought
of
that
God
of
Battles
of
ours
,
*NL*
that
Jealous
God
,
that
Vengeance-is-mine
God
.
I
thought
of
our
*NL*
world-nightmare
--
Hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
theory
of
eternal
punishment
then
,
I
take
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ellador
laughed
.
Her
eyes
were
as
bright
as
stars
,
and
there
were
tears
*NL*
in
them
,
too
.
She
was
so
sorry
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
we
?
''
she
asked
,
fairly
enough
.
``
We
have
no
punishments
in
*NL*
life
,
you
see
,
so
we
do
n't
imagine
them
after
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
NO
punishments
?
Neither
for
children
nor
criminals
--
such
mild
*NL*
criminals
as
you
have
?
''
I
urged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
punish
a
person
for
a
broken
leg
or
a
fever
?
We
have
preventive
*NL*
measures
,
and
cures
;
sometimes
we
have
to
`
send
the
patient
to
bed
,
'
as
*NL*
it
were
;
but
that
's
not
a
punishment
--
it
's
only
part
of
the
treatment
,
''
*NL*
she
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
studying
my
point
of
view
more
closely
,
she
added
:
``
You
see
,
we
*NL*
recognize
,
in
our
human
motherhood
,
a
great
tender
limitless
uplifting
*NL*
force
--
patience
and
wisdom
and
all
subtlety
of
delicate
method
.
We
*NL*
credit
God
--
our
idea
of
God
--
with
all
that
and
more
.
Our
mothers
are
not
*NL*
angry
with
us
--
why
should
God
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
God
mean
a
person
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
she
thought
over
a
little
.
``
Why
--
in
trying
to
get
close
to
it
in
*NL*
our
minds
we
personify
the
idea
,
naturally
;
but
we
certainly
do
*NL*
not
assume
a
Big
Woman
somewhere
,
who
is
God
.
What
we
call
God
is
a
*NL*
Pervading
Power
,
you
know
,
an
Indwelling
Spirit
,
something
inside
of
us
*NL*
that
we
want
more
of
.
Is
your
God
a
Big
Man
?
''
she
asked
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
yes
,
to
most
of
us
,
I
think
.
Of
course
we
call
it
an
Indwelling
*NL*
Spirit
just
as
you
do
,
but
we
insist
that
it
is
Him
,
a
Person
,
and
a
*NL*
Man
--
with
whiskers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whiskers
?
Oh
yes
--
because
you
have
them
!
Or
do
you
wear
them
because
He
*NL*
does
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
we
shave
them
off
--
because
it
seems
cleaner
and
more
*NL*
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
He
wear
clothes
--
in
your
idea
,
I
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
thinking
over
the
pictures
of
God
I
had
seen
--
rash
advances
of
the
*NL*
devout
mind
of
man
,
representing
his
Omnipotent
Deity
as
an
old
man
in
*NL*
a
flowing
robe
,
flowing
hair
,
flowing
beard
,
and
in
the
light
of
her
*NL*
perfectly
frank
and
innocent
questions
this
concept
seemed
rather
*NL*
unsatisfying
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
explained
that
the
God
of
the
Christian
world
was
really
the
ancient
*NL*
Hebrew
God
,
and
that
we
had
simply
taken
over
the
patriarchal
idea
--
that
*NL*
ancient
one
which
quite
inevitably
clothed
its
thought
of
God
with
the
*NL*
attributes
of
the
patriarchal
ruler
,
the
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
she
said
eagerly
,
after
I
had
explained
the
genesis
and
*NL*
development
of
our
religious
ideals
.
``
They
lived
in
separate
groups
,
*NL*
with
a
male
head
,
and
he
was
probably
a
little
--
domineering
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
of
that
,
''
I
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
live
together
without
any
`
head
,
'
in
that
sense
--
just
our
chosen
*NL*
leaders
--
that
DOES
make
a
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
difference
is
deeper
than
that
,
''
I
assured
her
.
``
It
is
in
your
*NL*
common
motherhood
.
Your
children
grow
up
in
a
world
where
everybody
*NL*
loves
them
.
They
find
life
made
rich
and
happy
for
them
by
the
diffused
*NL*
love
and
wisdom
of
all
mothers
.
So
it
is
easy
for
you
to
think
of
God
in
*NL*
the
terms
of
a
similar
diffused
and
competent
love
.
I
think
you
are
far
*NL*
nearer
right
than
we
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
can
not
understand
,
''
she
pursued
carefully
,
``
is
your
preservation
*NL*
of
such
a
very
ancient
state
of
mind
.
This
patriarchal
idea
you
tell
me
*NL*
is
thousands
of
years
old
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
four
,
five
,
six
thousand
--
every
so
many
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
made
wonderful
progress
in
those
years
--
in
other
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
certainly
have
.
But
religion
is
different
.
You
see
,
our
religions
*NL*
come
from
behind
us
,
and
are
initiated
by
some
great
teacher
who
is
*NL*
dead
.
He
is
supposed
to
have
known
the
whole
thing
and
taught
it
,
*NL*
finally
.
All
we
have
to
do
is
believe
--
and
obey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
the
great
Hebrew
teacher
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
there
it
was
different
.
The
Hebrew
religion
is
an
accumulation
of
*NL*
extremely
ancient
traditions
,
some
far
older
than
their
people
,
and
grew
*NL*
by
accretion
down
the
ages
.
We
consider
it
inspired
--
`
the
Word
of
God
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
says
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
say
so
in
as
many
words
?
Who
wrote
that
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
try
to
recall
some
text
that
did
say
so
,
and
could
not
bring
*NL*
it
to
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apart
from
that
,
''
she
pursued
,
``
what
I
can
not
understand
is
why
you
*NL*
keep
these
early
religious
ideas
so
long
.
You
have
changed
all
your
*NL*
others
,
have
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
generally
,
''
I
agreed
.
``
But
this
we
call
`
revealed
religion
,
'
*NL*
and
think
it
is
final
.
But
tell
me
more
about
these
little
temples
of
*NL*
yours
,
''
I
urged
.
``
And
these
Temple
Mothers
you
run
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
gave
me
an
extended
lesson
in
applied
religion
,
which
I
will
*NL*
endeavor
to
concentrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
developed
their
central
theory
of
a
Loving
Power
,
and
assumed
that
*NL*
its
relation
to
them
was
motherly
--
that
it
desired
their
welfare
and
*NL*
especially
their
development
.
Their
relation
to
it
,
similarly
,
was
*NL*
filial
,
a
loving
appreciation
and
a
glad
fulfillment
of
its
high
*NL*
purposes
.
Then
,
being
nothing
if
not
practical
,
they
set
their
keen
*NL*
and
active
minds
to
discover
the
kind
of
conduct
expected
of
them
.
This
*NL*
worked
out
in
a
most
admirable
system
of
ethics
.
The
principle
of
Love
*NL*
was
universally
recognized
--
and
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
Patience
,
gentleness
,
courtesy
,
all
that
we
call
``
good
breeding
,
''
was
*NL*
part
of
their
code
of
conduct
.
But
where
they
went
far
beyond
us
was
*NL*
in
the
special
application
of
religious
feeling
to
every
field
of
*NL*
life
.
They
had
no
ritual
,
no
little
set
of
performances
called
``
divine
*NL*
service
,
''
save
those
religious
pageants
I
have
spoken
of
,
and
those
were
*NL*
as
much
educational
as
religious
,
and
as
much
social
as
either
.
But
they
*NL*
had
a
clear
established
connection
between
everything
they
did
--
and
*NL*
God
.
Their
cleanliness
,
their
health
,
their
exquisite
order
,
the
rich
*NL*
peaceful
beauty
of
the
whole
land
,
the
happiness
of
the
children
,
and
*NL*
above
all
the
constant
progress
they
made
--
all
this
was
their
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
applied
their
minds
to
the
thought
of
God
,
and
worked
out
the
*NL*
theory
that
such
an
inner
power
demanded
outward
expression
.
They
lived
*NL*
as
if
God
was
real
and
at
work
within
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
those
little
temples
everywhere
--
some
of
the
women
were
more
*NL*
skilled
,
more
temperamentally
inclined
,
in
this
direction
,
than
others
.
*NL*
These
,
whatever
their
work
might
be
,
gave
certain
hours
to
the
Temple
*NL*
Service
,
which
meant
being
there
with
all
their
love
and
wisdom
and
*NL*
trained
thought
,
to
smooth
out
rough
places
for
anyone
who
needed
it
.
*NL*
Sometimes
it
was
a
real
grief
,
very
rarely
a
quarrel
,
most
often
a
*NL*
perplexity
;
even
in
Herland
the
human
soul
had
its
hours
of
darkness
.
*NL*
But
all
through
the
country
their
best
and
wisest
were
ready
to
give
*NL*
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
difficulty
was
unusually
profound
,
the
applicant
was
directed
to
*NL*
someone
more
specially
experienced
in
that
line
of
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
religion
which
gave
to
the
searching
mind
a
rational
basis
*NL*
in
life
,
the
concept
of
an
immense
Loving
Power
working
steadily
out
*NL*
through
them
,
toward
good
.
It
gave
to
the
``
soul
''
that
sense
of
contact
*NL*
with
the
inmost
force
,
of
perception
of
the
uttermost
purpose
,
which
we
*NL*
always
crave
.
It
gave
to
the
``
heart
''
the
blessed
feeling
of
being
loved
,
*NL*
loved
and
UNDERSTOOD
.
It
gave
clear
,
simple
,
rational
directions
as
*NL*
to
how
we
should
live
--
and
why
.
And
for
ritual
it
gave
first
those
*NL*
triumphant
group
demonstrations
,
when
with
a
union
of
all
the
arts
,
*NL*
the
revivifying
combination
of
great
multitudes
moved
rhythmically
with
*NL*
march
and
dance
,
song
and
music
,
among
their
own
noblest
products
*NL*
and
the
open
beauty
of
their
groves
and
hills
.
Second
,
it
gave
these
*NL*
numerous
little
centers
of
wisdom
where
the
least
wise
could
go
to
the
*NL*
most
wise
and
be
helped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
beautiful
!
''
I
cried
enthusiastically
.
``
It
is
the
most
practical
,
*NL*
comforting
,
progressive
religion
I
ever
heard
of
.
You
DO
love
one
*NL*
another
--
you
DO
bear
one
another
's
burdens
--
you
DO
realize
that
a
little
*NL*
child
is
a
type
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
.
You
are
more
Christian
than
*NL*
any
people
I
ever
saw
.
But
--
how
about
death
?
And
the
life
everlasting
?
*NL*
What
does
your
religion
teach
about
eternity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Ellador
.
``
What
is
eternity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
indeed
?
I
tried
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
to
get
a
real
hold
*NL*
on
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
--
never
stopping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
stopping
?
''
She
looked
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
life
,
going
on
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
we
see
that
,
of
course
.
Life
does
go
on
forever
,
all
about
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
eternal
life
goes
on
WITHOUT
DYING
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
same
person
,
unending
,
immortal
.
''
I
was
pleased
to
think
*NL*
that
I
had
something
to
teach
from
our
religion
,
which
theirs
had
never
*NL*
promulgated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
?
''
asked
Ellador
.
``
Never
to
die
--
here
?
''
I
could
see
her
practical
*NL*
mind
heaping
up
the
people
,
and
hurriedly
reassured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
indeed
,
not
here
--
hereafter
.
We
must
die
here
,
of
course
,
but
*NL*
then
we
`
enter
into
eternal
life
.
'
The
soul
lives
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
attempt
to
prove
it
to
you
,
''
I
hastily
continued
.
``
Let
us
*NL*
assume
it
to
be
so
.
How
does
this
idea
strike
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
smiled
at
me
,
that
adorable
,
dimpling
,
tender
,
mischievous
,
*NL*
motherly
smile
of
hers
.
``
Shall
I
be
quite
,
quite
honest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
be
anything
else
,
''
I
said
,
half
gladly
and
half
a
little
*NL*
sorry
.
The
transparent
honesty
of
these
women
was
a
never-ending
*NL*
astonishment
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
a
singularly
foolish
idea
,
''
she
said
calmly
.
``
And
if
*NL*
true
,
most
disagreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
had
always
accepted
the
doctrine
of
personal
immortality
as
*NL*
a
thing
established
.
The
efforts
of
inquiring
spiritualists
,
always
*NL*
seeking
to
woo
their
beloved
ghosts
back
again
,
never
seemed
to
me
*NL*
necessary
.
I
do
n't
say
I
had
ever
seriously
and
courageously
discussed
*NL*
the
subject
with
myself
even
;
I
had
simply
assumed
it
to
be
a
fact
.
*NL*
And
here
was
the
girl
I
loved
,
this
creature
whose
character
constantly
*NL*
revealed
new
heights
and
ranges
far
beyond
my
own
,
this
superwoman
of
a
*NL*
superland
,
saying
she
thought
immortality
foolish
!
She
meant
it
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
WANT
it
for
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
NOT
want
it
!
''
I
protested
.
``
Do
you
want
to
go
out
like
a
*NL*
candle
?
Do
n't
you
want
to
go
on
and
on
--
growing
and
--
and
--
being
happy
,
*NL*
forever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
do
n't
in
the
least
.
I
want
my
child
--
and
my
*NL*
child
's
child
--
to
go
on
--
and
they
will
.
Why
should
_
I
_
want
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
means
Heaven
!
''
I
insisted
.
``
Peace
and
Beauty
and
Comfort
*NL*
and
Love
--
with
God
.
''
I
had
never
been
so
eloquent
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
religion
.
She
could
be
horrified
at
Damnation
,
and
question
the
justice
*NL*
of
Salvation
,
but
Immortality
--
that
was
surely
a
noble
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Van
,
''
she
said
,
holding
out
her
hands
to
me
.
``
Why
Van
--
darling
!
*NL*
How
splendid
of
you
to
feel
it
so
keenly
.
That
's
what
we
all
want
,
of
*NL*
course
--
Peace
and
Beauty
,
and
Comfort
and
Love
--
with
God
!
And
Progress
*NL*
too
,
remember
;
Growth
,
always
and
always
.
That
is
what
our
religion
*NL*
teaches
us
to
want
and
to
work
for
,
and
we
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
HERE
,
''
I
said
,
``
only
for
this
life
on
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
And
do
not
you
in
your
country
,
with
your
beautiful
religion
of
*NL*
love
and
service
have
it
here
,
too
--
for
this
life
--
on
earth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
us
were
willing
to
tell
the
women
of
Herland
about
the
evils
of
*NL*
our
own
beloved
land
.
It
was
all
very
well
for
us
to
assume
them
to
*NL*
be
necessary
and
essential
,
and
to
criticize
--
strictly
among
*NL*
ourselves
--
their
all-too-perfect
civilization
,
but
when
it
came
to
*NL*
telling
them
about
the
failures
and
wastes
of
our
own
,
we
never
could
*NL*
bring
ourselves
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
we
sought
to
avoid
too
much
discussion
,
and
to
press
the
*NL*
subject
of
our
approaching
marriages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
was
the
determined
one
on
this
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
they
have
n't
any
marriage
ceremony
or
service
,
but
we
can
*NL*
make
it
a
sort
of
Quaker
wedding
,
and
have
it
in
the
temple
--
it
is
the
*NL*
least
we
can
do
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
.
There
was
so
little
,
after
all
,
that
we
could
do
for
them
.
Here
*NL*
we
were
,
penniless
guests
and
strangers
,
with
no
chance
even
to
use
*NL*
our
strength
and
courage
--
nothing
to
defend
them
from
or
protect
them
*NL*
against
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
at
least
give
them
our
names
,
''
Jeff
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
very
sweet
about
it
,
quite
willing
to
do
whatever
we
asked
,
to
*NL*
please
us
.
As
to
the
names
,
Alima
,
frank
soul
that
she
was
,
asked
what
*NL*
good
it
would
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
,
always
irritating
her
,
said
it
was
a
sign
of
possession
.
``
You
are
*NL*
going
to
be
Mrs.
Nicholson
,
''
he
said
.
``
Mrs.
T.
O.
Nicholson
.
That
shows
*NL*
everyone
that
you
are
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
a
`
wife
'
exactly
?
''
she
demanded
,
a
dangerous
gleam
in
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wife
is
the
woman
who
belongs
to
a
man
,
''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jeff
took
it
up
eagerly
:
``
And
a
husband
is
the
man
who
belongs
to
*NL*
a
woman
.
It
is
because
we
are
monogamous
,
you
know
.
And
marriage
is
the
*NL*
ceremony
,
civil
and
religious
,
that
joins
the
two
together
--
`
until
death
*NL*
do
us
part
,
'
''
he
finished
,
looking
at
Celis
with
unutterable
devotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
us
all
feel
foolish
,
''
I
told
the
girls
,
``
is
that
here
we
*NL*
have
nothing
to
give
you
--
except
,
of
course
,
our
names
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
your
women
have
no
names
before
they
are
married
?
''
Celis
suddenly
*NL*
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
Jeff
explained
.
``
They
have
their
maiden
names
--
their
*NL*
father
's
names
,
that
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
becomes
of
them
?
''
asked
Alima
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
change
them
for
their
husbands
'
,
my
dear
,
''
Terry
answered
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Change
them
?
Do
the
husbands
then
take
the
wives
'
`
maiden
names
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
he
laughed
.
``
The
man
keeps
his
own
and
gives
it
to
her
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
just
loses
hers
and
takes
a
new
one
--
how
unpleasant
!
We
wo
n't
*NL*
do
that
!
''
Alima
said
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
good-humored
about
it
.
``
I
do
n't
care
what
you
do
or
do
n't
do
*NL*
so
long
as
we
have
that
wedding
pretty
soon
,
''
he
said
,
reaching
a
strong
*NL*
brown
hand
after
Alima
's
,
quite
as
brown
and
nearly
as
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
giving
us
things
--
of
course
we
can
see
that
you
'd
like
to
,
but
*NL*
we
are
glad
you
ca
n't
,
''
Celis
continued
.
``
You
see
,
we
love
you
just
for
*NL*
yourselves
--
we
would
n't
want
you
to
--
to
pay
anything
.
Is
n't
it
enough
to
*NL*
know
that
you
are
loved
personally
--
and
just
as
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enough
or
not
,
that
was
the
way
we
were
married
.
We
had
a
great
triple
*NL*
wedding
in
the
biggest
temple
of
all
,
and
it
looked
as
if
most
of
the
*NL*
nation
was
present
.
It
was
very
solemn
and
very
beautiful
.
Someone
had
*NL*
written
a
new
song
for
the
occasion
,
nobly
beautiful
,
about
the
New
Hope
*NL*
for
their
people
--
the
New
Tie
with
other
lands
--
Brotherhood
as
well
as
*NL*
Sisterhood
,
and
,
with
evident
awe
,
Fatherhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
always
restive
under
their
talk
of
fatherhood
.
``
Anybody
'd
*NL*
think
we
were
High
Priests
of
--
of
Philoprogenitiveness
!
''
he
protested
.
*NL*
``
These
women
think
of
NOTHING
but
children
,
seems
to
me
!
We
'll
teach
*NL*
'em
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
certain
of
what
he
was
going
to
teach
,
and
Alima
so
uncertain
*NL*
in
her
moods
of
reception
,
that
Jeff
and
I
feared
the
worst
.
We
tried
to
*NL*
caution
him
--
much
good
that
did
.
The
big
handsome
fellow
drew
himself
up
*NL*
to
his
full
height
,
lifted
that
great
chest
of
his
,
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
three
separate
marriages
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
wo
n't
interfere
with
*NL*
yours
--
nor
you
with
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
great
day
came
,
and
the
countless
crowds
of
women
,
and
we
three
*NL*
bridegrooms
without
any
supporting
``
best
men
,
''
or
any
other
men
to
back
*NL*
us
up
,
felt
strangely
small
as
we
came
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somel
and
Zava
and
Moadine
were
on
hand
;
we
were
thankful
to
have
them
,
*NL*
too
--
they
seemed
almost
like
relatives
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
splendid
procession
,
wreathing
dances
,
the
new
anthem
I
*NL*
spoke
of
,
and
the
whole
great
place
pulsed
with
feeling
--
the
deep
awe
,
*NL*
the
sweet
hope
,
the
wondering
expectation
of
a
new
miracle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
been
nothing
like
this
in
the
country
since
our
Motherhood
*NL*
began
!
''
Somel
said
softly
to
me
,
while
we
watched
the
symbolic
marches
.
*NL*
``
You
see
,
it
is
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
.
You
do
n't
know
how
much
you
mean
*NL*
to
us
.
It
is
not
only
Fatherhood
--
that
marvelous
dual
parentage
to
*NL*
which
we
are
strangers
--
the
miracle
of
union
in
life-giving
--
but
it
is
*NL*
Brotherhood
.
You
are
the
rest
of
the
world
.
You
join
us
to
our
kind
--
to
*NL*
all
the
strange
lands
and
peoples
we
have
never
seen
.
We
hope
to
know
*NL*
them
--
to
love
and
help
them
--
and
to
learn
of
them
.
Ah
!
You
can
not
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thousands
of
voices
rose
in
the
soaring
climax
of
that
great
Hymn
of
The
*NL*
Coming
Life
.
By
the
great
Altar
of
Motherhood
,
with
its
crown
of
fruit
*NL*
and
flowers
,
stood
a
new
one
,
crowned
as
well
.
Before
the
Great
Over
*NL*
Mother
of
the
Land
and
her
ring
of
High
Temple
Counsellors
,
before
that
*NL*
vast
multitude
of
calm-faced
mothers
and
holy-eyed
maidens
,
came
forward
*NL*
our
own
three
chosen
ones
,
and
we
,
three
men
alone
in
all
that
land
,
*NL*
joined
hands
with
them
and
made
our
marriage
vows
.

CHAPTER
11
.
Our
Difficulties
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
say
,
``
Marriage
is
a
lottery
''
;
also
``
Marriages
are
made
in
*NL*
Heaven
''
--
but
this
is
not
so
widely
accepted
as
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
a
well-founded
theory
that
it
is
best
to
marry
``
in
one
's
class
,
''
*NL*
and
certain
well-grounded
suspicions
of
international
marriages
,
which
*NL*
seem
to
persist
in
the
interests
of
social
progress
,
rather
than
in
*NL*
those
of
the
contracting
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
combination
of
alien
races
,
of
color
,
of
caste
,
or
creed
,
was
*NL*
ever
so
basically
difficult
to
establish
as
that
between
us
,
three
*NL*
modern
American
men
,
and
these
three
women
of
Herland
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
we
should
have
been
frank
about
it
*NL*
beforehand
.
We
had
been
frank
.
We
had
discussed
--
at
least
Ellador
and
*NL*
I
had
--
the
conditions
of
The
Great
Adventure
,
and
thought
the
path
*NL*
was
clear
before
us
.
But
there
are
some
things
one
takes
for
granted
,
*NL*
supposes
are
mutually
understood
,
and
to
which
both
parties
may
*NL*
repeatedly
refer
without
ever
meaning
the
same
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
differences
in
the
education
of
the
average
man
and
woman
are
*NL*
great
enough
,
but
the
trouble
they
make
is
not
mostly
for
the
man
;
he
*NL*
generally
carries
out
his
own
views
of
the
case
.
The
woman
may
have
*NL*
imagined
the
conditions
of
married
life
to
be
different
;
but
what
she
*NL*
imagined
,
was
ignorant
of
,
or
might
have
preferred
,
did
not
seriously
*NL*
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
see
clearly
and
speak
calmly
about
this
now
,
writing
after
a
lapse
*NL*
of
years
,
years
full
of
growth
and
education
,
but
at
the
time
it
was
*NL*
rather
hard
sledding
for
all
of
us
--
especially
for
Terry
.
Poor
Terry
!
*NL*
You
see
,
in
any
other
imaginable
marriage
among
the
peoples
of
the
*NL*
earth
,
whether
the
woman
were
black
,
red
,
yellow
,
brown
,
or
white
;
*NL*
whether
she
were
ignorant
or
educated
,
submissive
or
rebellious
,
she
*NL*
would
have
behind
her
the
marriage
tradition
of
our
general
history
.
*NL*
This
tradition
relates
the
woman
to
the
man
.
He
goes
on
with
his
*NL*
business
,
and
she
adapts
herself
to
him
and
to
it
.
Even
in
citizenship
,
*NL*
by
some
strange
hocus-pocus
,
that
fact
of
birth
and
geography
was
waved
*NL*
aside
,
and
the
woman
automatically
acquired
the
nationality
of
her
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
--
here
were
we
,
three
aliens
in
this
land
of
women
.
It
was
small
in
*NL*
area
,
and
the
external
differences
were
not
so
great
as
to
astound
us
.
*NL*
We
did
not
yet
appreciate
the
differences
between
the
race-mind
of
this
*NL*
people
and
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
they
were
a
``
pure
stock
''
of
two
thousand
*NL*
uninterrupted
years
.
Where
we
have
some
long
connected
lines
of
*NL*
thought
and
feeling
,
together
with
a
wide
range
of
differences
,
often
*NL*
irreconcilable
,
these
people
were
smoothly
and
firmly
agreed
on
most
of
*NL*
the
basic
principles
of
their
life
;
and
not
only
agreed
in
principle
,
*NL*
but
accustomed
for
these
sixty-odd
generations
to
act
on
those
*NL*
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
one
thing
which
we
did
not
understand
--
had
made
no
allowance
*NL*
for
.
When
in
our
pre-marital
discussions
one
of
those
dear
girls
had
*NL*
said
:
``
We
understand
it
thus
and
thus
,
''
or
``
We
hold
such
and
such
to
be
*NL*
true
,
''
we
men
,
in
our
own
deep-seated
convictions
of
the
power
of
love
,
*NL*
and
our
easy
views
about
beliefs
and
principles
,
fondly
imagined
that
*NL*
we
could
convince
them
otherwise
.
What
we
imagined
,
before
marriage
,
did
*NL*
not
matter
any
more
than
what
an
average
innocent
young
girl
imagines
.
*NL*
We
found
the
facts
to
be
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
that
they
did
not
love
us
;
they
did
,
deeply
and
warmly
.
But
*NL*
there
are
you
again
--
what
they
meant
by
``
love
''
and
what
we
meant
by
*NL*
``
love
''
were
so
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
it
seems
rather
cold-blooded
to
say
``
we
''
and
``
they
,
''
as
if
we
*NL*
were
not
separate
couples
,
with
our
separate
joys
and
sorrows
,
but
our
*NL*
positions
as
aliens
drove
us
together
constantly
.
The
whole
strange
*NL*
experience
had
made
our
friendship
more
close
and
intimate
than
it
would
*NL*
ever
have
become
in
a
free
and
easy
lifetime
among
our
own
people
.
*NL*
Also
,
as
men
,
with
our
masculine
tradition
of
far
more
than
two
thousand
*NL*
years
,
we
were
a
unit
,
small
but
firm
,
against
this
far
larger
unit
of
*NL*
feminine
tradition
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
I
can
make
clear
the
points
of
difference
without
a
too
painful
*NL*
explicitness
.
The
more
external
disagreement
was
in
the
matter
of
``
the
*NL*
home
,
''
and
the
housekeeping
duties
and
pleasures
we
,
by
instinct
and
*NL*
long
education
,
supposed
to
be
inherently
appropriate
to
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
give
two
illustrations
,
one
away
up
,
and
the
other
away
down
,
to
*NL*
show
how
completely
disappointed
we
were
in
this
regard
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
lower
one
,
try
to
imagine
a
male
ant
,
coming
from
some
state
of
*NL*
existence
where
ants
live
in
pairs
,
endeavoring
to
set
up
housekeeping
*NL*
with
a
female
ant
from
a
highly
developed
anthill
.
This
female
ant
might
*NL*
regard
him
with
intense
personal
affection
,
but
her
ideas
of
parentage
*NL*
and
economic
management
would
be
on
a
very
different
scale
from
his
.
*NL*
Now
,
of
course
,
if
she
was
a
stray
female
in
a
country
of
pairing
ants
,
*NL*
he
might
have
had
his
way
with
her
;
but
if
he
was
a
stray
male
in
an
*NL*
anthill
--
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
higher
one
,
try
to
imagine
a
devoted
and
impassioned
man
trying
*NL*
to
set
up
housekeeping
with
a
lady
angel
,
a
real
wings-and-harp-and-halo
*NL*
angel
,
accustomed
to
fulfilling
divine
missions
all
over
interstellar
*NL*
space
.
This
angel
might
love
the
man
with
an
affection
quite
beyond
his
*NL*
power
of
return
or
even
of
appreciation
,
but
her
ideas
of
service
and
*NL*
duty
would
be
on
a
very
different
scale
from
his
.
Of
course
,
if
she
was
*NL*
a
stray
angel
in
a
country
of
men
,
he
might
have
had
his
way
with
her
;
*NL*
but
if
he
was
a
stray
man
among
angels
--
!
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
,
at
his
worst
,
in
a
black
fury
for
which
,
as
a
man
,
I
must
have
*NL*
some
sympathy
,
preferred
the
ant
simile
.
More
of
Terry
and
his
special
*NL*
troubles
later
.
It
was
hard
on
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
--
well
,
Jeff
always
had
a
streak
that
was
too
good
for
this
world
!
*NL*
He
's
the
kind
that
would
have
made
a
saintly
priest
in
parentagearlier
*NL*
times
.
He
accepted
the
angel
theory
,
swallowed
it
whole
,
tried
to
force
*NL*
it
on
us
--
with
varying
effect
.
He
so
worshipped
Celis
,
and
not
only
*NL*
Celis
,
but
what
she
represented
;
he
had
become
so
deeply
convinced
of
*NL*
the
almost
supernatural
advantages
of
this
country
and
people
,
that
he
*NL*
took
his
medicine
like
a
--
I
can
not
say
``
like
a
man
,
''
but
more
as
if
he
*NL*
was
n't
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
n't
misunderstand
me
for
a
moment
.
Dear
old
Jeff
was
no
milksop
or
*NL*
molly-coddle
either
.
He
was
a
strong
,
brave
,
efficient
man
,
and
an
*NL*
excellent
fighter
when
fighting
was
necessary
.
But
there
was
always
this
*NL*
angel
streak
in
him
.
It
was
rather
a
wonder
,
Terry
being
so
different
,
*NL*
that
he
really
loved
Jeff
as
he
did
;
but
it
happens
so
sometimes
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
difference
--
perhaps
because
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
me
,
I
stood
between
.
I
was
no
such
gay
Lothario
as
Terry
,
and
no
*NL*
such
Galahad
as
Jeff
.
But
for
all
my
limitations
I
think
I
had
the
habit
*NL*
of
using
my
brains
in
regard
to
behavior
rather
more
frequently
than
*NL*
either
of
them
.
I
had
to
use
brain-power
now
,
I
can
tell
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
big
point
at
issue
between
us
and
our
wives
was
,
as
may
easily
be
*NL*
imagined
,
in
the
very
nature
of
the
relation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wives
!
Do
n't
talk
to
me
about
wives
!
''
stormed
Terry
.
``
They
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
the
word
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
is
exactly
the
fact
--
they
did
n't
.
How
could
they
?
Back
in
their
*NL*
prehistoric
records
of
polygamy
and
slavery
there
were
no
ideals
of
*NL*
wifehood
as
we
know
it
,
and
since
then
no
possibility
of
forming
such
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
thing
they
can
think
of
about
a
man
is
FATHERHOOD
!
''
said
Terry
*NL*
in
high
scorn
.
``
FATHERHOOD
!
As
if
a
man
was
always
wanting
to
be
a
*NL*
FATHER
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
also
was
correct
.
They
had
their
long
,
wide
,
deep
,
rich
experience
*NL*
of
Motherhood
,
and
their
only
perception
of
the
value
of
a
male
creature
*NL*
as
such
was
for
Fatherhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aside
from
that
,
of
course
,
was
the
whole
range
of
personal
love
,
love
*NL*
which
as
Jeff
earnestly
phrased
it
``
passeth
the
love
of
women
!
''
It
did
,
*NL*
too
.
I
can
give
no
idea
--
either
now
,
after
long
and
happy
experience
of
*NL*
it
,
or
as
it
seemed
then
,
in
the
first
measureless
wonder
--
of
the
beauty
*NL*
and
power
of
the
love
they
gave
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Alima
--
who
had
a
more
stormy
temperament
than
either
of
the
others
,
*NL*
and
who
,
heaven
knows
,
had
far
more
provocation
--
even
Alima
was
patience
*NL*
and
tenderness
and
wisdom
personified
to
the
man
she
loved
,
until
*NL*
he
--
but
I
have
n't
got
to
that
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
These
,
as
Terry
put
it
,
``
alleged
or
so-called
wives
''
of
ours
,
went
right
*NL*
on
with
their
profession
as
foresters
.
We
,
having
no
special
learnings
,
*NL*
had
long
since
qualified
as
assistants
.
We
had
to
do
something
,
if
only
*NL*
to
pass
the
time
,
and
it
had
to
be
work
--
we
could
n't
be
playing
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
kept
us
out
of
doors
with
those
dear
girls
,
and
more
or
less
*NL*
together
--
too
much
together
sometimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
people
had
,
it
now
became
clear
to
us
,
the
highest
,
keenest
,
most
*NL*
delicate
sense
of
personal
privacy
,
but
not
the
faintest
idea
of
that
*NL*
SOLITUDE
A
DEUX
we
are
so
fond
of
.
They
had
,
every
one
of
them
,
the
``
two
*NL*
rooms
and
a
bath
''
theory
realized
.
From
earliest
childhood
each
had
*NL*
a
separate
bedroom
with
toilet
conveniences
,
and
one
of
the
marks
of
*NL*
coming
of
age
was
the
addition
of
an
outer
room
in
which
to
receive
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
since
we
had
been
given
our
own
two
rooms
apiece
,
and
as
being
of
a
*NL*
different
sex
and
race
,
these
were
in
a
separate
house
.
It
seemed
to
be
*NL*
recognized
that
we
should
breathe
easier
if
able
to
free
our
minds
in
*NL*
real
seclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
food
we
either
went
to
any
convenient
eating-house
,
ordered
a
meal
*NL*
brought
in
,
or
took
it
with
us
to
the
woods
,
always
and
equally
good
.
*NL*
All
this
we
had
become
used
to
and
enjoyed
--
in
our
courting
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
marriage
there
arose
in
us
a
somewhat
unexpected
urge
of
feeling
*NL*
that
called
for
a
separate
house
;
but
this
feeling
found
no
response
in
*NL*
the
hearts
of
those
fair
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ARE
alone
,
dear
,
''
Ellador
explained
to
me
with
gentle
patience
.
*NL*
``
We
are
alone
in
these
great
forests
;
we
may
go
and
eat
in
any
little
*NL*
summer-house
--
just
we
two
,
or
have
a
separate
table
anywhere
--
or
even
*NL*
have
a
separate
meal
in
our
own
rooms
.
How
could
we
be
aloner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
very
true
.
We
had
our
pleasant
mutual
solitude
about
our
*NL*
work
,
and
our
pleasant
evening
talks
in
their
apartments
or
ours
;
we
*NL*
had
,
as
it
were
,
all
the
pleasures
of
courtship
carried
right
on
;
but
we
*NL*
had
no
sense
of
--
perhaps
it
may
be
called
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
as
well
not
be
married
at
all
,
''
growled
Terry
.
``
They
only
got
up
*NL*
that
ceremony
to
please
us
--
please
Jeff
,
mostly
.
They
've
no
real
idea
of
*NL*
being
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
my
best
to
get
Ellador
's
point
of
view
,
and
naturally
I
tried
to
*NL*
give
her
mine
.
Of
course
,
what
we
,
as
men
,
wanted
to
make
them
see
was
*NL*
that
there
were
other
,
and
as
we
proudly
said
``
higher
,
''
uses
in
this
*NL*
relation
than
what
Terry
called
``
mere
parentage
.
''
In
the
highest
terms
I
*NL*
knew
I
tried
to
explain
this
to
Ellador
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
higher
than
for
mutual
love
to
hope
to
give
life
,
as
we
did
?
''
*NL*
she
said
.
``
How
is
it
higher
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
develops
love
,
''
I
explained
.
``
All
the
power
of
beautiful
permanent
*NL*
mated
love
comes
through
this
higher
development
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
?
''
she
asked
gently
.
``
How
do
you
know
that
it
was
so
*NL*
developed
?
There
are
some
birds
who
love
each
other
so
that
they
mope
*NL*
and
pine
if
separated
,
and
never
pair
again
if
one
dies
,
but
they
never
*NL*
mate
except
in
the
mating
season
.
Among
your
people
do
you
find
high
and
*NL*
lasting
affection
appearing
in
proportion
to
this
indulgence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
very
awkward
thing
,
sometimes
,
to
have
a
logical
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
knew
about
those
monogamous
birds
and
beasts
too
,
that
mate
*NL*
for
life
and
show
every
sign
of
mutual
affection
,
without
ever
having
*NL*
stretched
the
sex
relationship
beyond
its
original
range
.
But
what
of
*NL*
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
are
lower
forms
of
life
!
''
I
protested
.
``
They
have
no
capacity
*NL*
for
faithful
and
affectionate
,
and
apparently
happy
--
but
oh
,
my
dear
!
my
*NL*
dear
!
--
what
can
they
know
of
such
a
love
as
draws
us
together
?
Why
,
to
*NL*
touch
you
--
to
be
near
you
--
to
come
closer
and
closer
--
to
lose
myself
in
*NL*
you
--
surely
you
feel
it
too
,
do
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
came
nearer
.
I
seized
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
on
mine
,
tender
radiant
,
but
steady
and
strong
.
There
was
*NL*
something
so
powerful
,
so
large
and
changeless
,
in
those
eyes
that
*NL*
I
could
not
sweep
her
off
her
feet
by
my
own
emotion
as
I
had
*NL*
unconsciously
assumed
would
be
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
me
feel
as
,
one
might
imagine
,
a
man
might
feel
who
loved
a
*NL*
goddess
--
not
a
Venus
,
though
!
She
did
not
resent
my
attitude
,
did
not
*NL*
repel
it
,
did
not
in
the
least
fear
it
,
evidently
.
There
was
not
a
shade
*NL*
of
that
timid
withdrawal
or
pretty
resistance
which
are
so
--
provocative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
dearest
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
have
to
be
patient
with
us
.
We
are
*NL*
not
like
the
women
of
your
country
.
We
are
Mothers
,
and
we
are
People
,
*NL*
but
we
have
not
specialized
in
this
line
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
''
and
``
we
''
and
``
we
''
--
it
was
so
hard
to
get
her
to
be
personal
.
And
,
*NL*
as
I
thought
that
,
I
suddenly
remembered
how
we
were
always
criticizing
*NL*
OUR
women
for
BEING
so
personal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
did
my
earnest
best
to
picture
to
her
the
sweet
intense
joy
of
*NL*
married
lovers
,
and
the
result
in
higher
stimulus
to
all
creative
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
,
''
she
asked
quite
calmly
,
as
if
I
was
not
holding
her
cool
*NL*
firm
hands
in
my
hot
and
rather
quivering
ones
,
``
that
with
you
,
when
*NL*
people
marry
,
they
go
right
on
doing
this
in
season
and
out
of
season
,
*NL*
with
no
thought
of
children
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
,
''
I
said
,
with
some
bitterness
.
``
They
are
not
mere
parents
.
*NL*
They
are
men
and
women
,
and
they
love
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
?
''
asked
Ellador
,
rather
unexpectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
?
''
I
repeated
,
a
little
dashed
.
``
Why
as
long
as
they
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
very
beautiful
in
the
idea
,
''
she
admitted
,
still
as
*NL*
if
she
were
discussing
life
on
Mars
.
``
This
climactic
expression
,
which
,
*NL*
in
all
the
other
life-forms
,
has
but
the
one
purpose
,
has
with
you
*NL*
become
specialized
to
higher
,
purer
,
nobler
uses
.
It
has
--
I
judge
from
*NL*
what
you
tell
me
--
the
most
ennobling
effect
on
character
.
People
marry
,
*NL*
not
only
for
parentage
,
but
for
this
exquisite
interchange
--
and
,
as
*NL*
a
result
,
you
have
a
world
full
of
continuous
lovers
,
ardent
,
happy
,
*NL*
mutually
devoted
,
always
living
on
that
high
tide
of
supreme
emotion
*NL*
which
we
had
supposed
to
belong
only
to
one
season
and
one
use
.
And
you
*NL*
say
it
has
other
results
,
stimulating
all
high
creative
work
.
That
must
*NL*
mean
floods
,
oceans
of
such
work
,
blossoming
from
this
intense
happiness
*NL*
of
every
married
pair
!
It
is
a
beautiful
idea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
,
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
was
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slipped
one
hand
free
,
and
was
stroking
my
hair
with
it
in
a
gentle
*NL*
motherly
way
.
I
bowed
my
hot
head
on
her
shoulder
and
felt
a
dim
sense
*NL*
of
peace
,
a
restfulness
which
was
very
pleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
take
me
there
someday
,
darling
,
''
she
was
saying
.
``
It
is
*NL*
not
only
that
I
love
you
so
much
,
I
want
to
see
your
country
--
your
*NL*
people
--
your
mother
--
''
she
paused
reverently
.
``
Oh
,
how
I
shall
love
your
*NL*
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
been
in
love
many
times
--
my
experience
did
not
compare
*NL*
with
Terry
's
.
But
such
as
I
had
was
so
different
from
this
that
I
was
*NL*
perplexed
,
and
full
of
mixed
feelings
:
partly
a
growing
sense
of
common
*NL*
ground
between
us
,
a
pleasant
rested
calm
feeling
,
which
I
had
imagined
*NL*
could
only
be
attained
in
one
way
;
and
partly
a
bewildered
resentment
*NL*
because
what
I
found
was
not
what
I
had
looked
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
their
confounded
psychology
!
Here
they
were
with
this
profound
*NL*
highly
developed
system
of
education
so
bred
into
them
that
even
if
they
*NL*
were
not
teachers
by
profession
they
all
had
a
general
proficiency
in
*NL*
it
--
it
was
second
nature
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
no
child
,
stormily
demanding
a
cookie
``
between
meals
,
''
was
ever
more
*NL*
subtly
diverted
into
an
interest
in
house-building
than
was
I
when
*NL*
I
found
an
apparently
imperative
demand
had
disappeared
without
my
*NL*
noticing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
the
time
those
tender
mother
eyes
,
those
keen
scientific
eyes
,
*NL*
noting
every
condition
and
circumstance
,
and
learning
how
to
``
take
time
*NL*
by
the
forelock
''
and
avoid
discussion
before
occasion
arose
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
amazed
at
the
results
.
I
found
that
much
,
very
much
,
of
what
I
had
*NL*
honestly
supposed
to
be
a
physiological
necessity
was
a
psychological
*NL*
necessity
--
or
so
believed
.
I
found
,
after
my
ideas
of
what
was
essential
*NL*
had
changed
,
that
my
feelings
changed
also
.
And
more
than
all
,
I
found
*NL*
this
--
a
factor
of
enormous
weight
--
these
women
were
not
provocative
.
*NL*
That
made
an
immense
difference
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thing
that
Terry
had
so
complained
of
when
we
first
came
--
that
they
*NL*
were
n't
``
feminine
,
''
they
lacked
``
charm
,
''
now
became
a
great
comfort
.
*NL*
Their
vigorous
beauty
was
an
aesthetic
pleasure
,
not
an
irritant
.
Their
*NL*
dress
and
ornaments
had
not
a
touch
of
the
``
come-and-find-me
''
element
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
with
my
own
Ellador
,
my
wife
,
who
had
for
a
time
unveiled
a
woman
's
*NL*
heart
and
faced
the
strange
new
hope
and
joy
of
dual
parentage
,
she
*NL*
afterward
withdrew
again
into
the
same
good
comrade
she
had
been
at
*NL*
first
.
They
were
women
,
PLUS
,
and
so
much
plus
that
when
they
did
not
*NL*
choose
to
let
the
womanness
appear
,
you
could
not
find
it
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
say
it
was
easy
for
me
;
it
was
n't
.
But
when
I
made
appeal
to
*NL*
her
sympathies
I
came
up
against
another
immovable
wall
.
She
was
sorry
,
*NL*
honestly
sorry
,
for
my
distresses
,
and
made
all
manner
of
thoughtful
*NL*
suggestions
,
often
quite
useful
,
as
well
as
the
wise
foresight
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
above
,
which
often
saved
all
difficulty
before
it
arose
;
but
*NL*
her
sympathy
did
not
alter
her
convictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
thought
it
was
really
right
and
necessary
,
I
could
perhaps
bring
*NL*
myself
to
it
,
for
your
sake
,
dear
;
but
I
do
not
want
to
--
not
at
all
.
*NL*
You
would
not
have
a
mere
submission
,
would
you
?
That
is
not
the
kind
of
*NL*
high
romantic
love
you
spoke
of
,
surely
?
It
is
a
pity
,
of
course
,
that
*NL*
you
should
have
to
adjust
your
highly
specialized
faculties
to
our
*NL*
unspecialized
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Confound
it
!
I
had
n't
married
the
nation
,
and
I
told
her
so
.
But
she
*NL*
only
smiled
at
her
own
limitations
and
explained
that
she
had
to
``
think
*NL*
in
we
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Confound
it
again
!
Here
I
'd
have
all
my
energies
focused
on
one
wish
,
*NL*
and
before
I
knew
it
she
'd
have
them
dissipated
in
one
direction
or
*NL*
another
,
some
subject
of
discussion
that
began
just
at
the
point
I
was
*NL*
talking
about
and
ended
miles
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
not
be
imagined
that
I
was
just
repelled
,
ignored
,
left
to
*NL*
cherish
a
grievance
.
Not
at
all
.
My
happiness
was
in
the
hands
of
a
*NL*
larger
,
sweeter
womanhood
than
I
had
ever
imagined
.
Before
our
marriage
*NL*
my
own
ardor
had
perhaps
blinded
me
to
much
of
this
.
I
was
madly
in
love
*NL*
with
not
so
much
what
was
there
as
with
what
I
supposed
to
be
there
.
Now
*NL*
I
found
an
endlessly
beautiful
undiscovered
country
to
explore
,
and
in
*NL*
it
the
sweetest
wisdom
and
understanding
.
It
was
as
if
I
had
come
to
*NL*
some
new
place
and
people
,
with
a
desire
to
eat
at
all
hours
,
and
no
*NL*
other
interests
in
particular
;
and
as
if
my
hosts
,
instead
of
merely
*NL*
saying
,
``
You
shall
not
eat
,
''
had
presently
aroused
in
me
a
lively
desire
*NL*
for
music
,
for
pictures
,
for
games
,
for
exercise
,
for
playing
in
the
*NL*
water
,
for
running
some
ingenious
machine
;
and
,
in
the
multitude
of
my
*NL*
satisfactions
,
I
forgot
the
one
point
which
was
not
satisfied
,
and
got
*NL*
along
very
well
until
mealtime
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
cleverest
and
most
ingenious
of
these
tricks
was
only
clear
*NL*
to
me
many
years
after
,
when
we
were
so
wholly
at
one
on
this
subject
*NL*
that
I
could
laugh
at
my
own
predicament
then
.
It
was
this
:
You
see
,
*NL*
with
us
,
women
are
kept
as
different
as
possible
and
as
feminine
as
*NL*
possible
.
We
men
have
our
own
world
,
with
only
men
in
it
;
we
get
tired
*NL*
of
our
ultra-maleness
and
turn
gladly
to
the
ultra-femaleness
.
Also
,
*NL*
in
keeping
our
women
as
feminine
as
possible
,
we
see
to
it
that
when
*NL*
we
turn
to
them
we
find
the
thing
we
want
always
in
evidence
.
Well
,
the
*NL*
atmosphere
of
this
place
was
anything
but
seductive
.
The
very
numbers
*NL*
of
these
human
women
,
always
in
human
relation
,
made
them
anything
*NL*
but
alluring
.
When
,
in
spite
of
this
,
my
hereditary
instincts
and
*NL*
race-traditions
made
me
long
for
the
feminine
response
in
Ellador
,
*NL*
instead
of
withdrawing
so
that
I
should
want
her
more
,
she
deliberately
*NL*
gave
me
a
little
too
much
of
her
society
.
--
always
de-feminized
,
as
it
*NL*
were
.
It
was
awfully
funny
,
really
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
I
,
with
an
Ideal
in
mind
,
for
which
I
hotly
longed
,
and
here
*NL*
was
she
,
deliberately
obtruding
in
the
foreground
of
my
consciousness
a
*NL*
Fact
--
a
fact
which
I
coolly
enjoyed
,
but
which
actually
interfered
with
*NL*
what
I
wanted
.
I
see
now
clearly
enough
why
a
certain
kind
of
man
,
like
*NL*
Sir
Almroth
Wright
,
resents
the
professional
development
of
women
.
It
*NL*
gets
in
the
way
of
the
sex
ideal
;
it
temporarily
covers
and
excludes
*NL*
femininity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
in
this
case
,
I
was
so
fond
of
Ellador
my
friend
,
of
Ellador
*NL*
my
professional
companion
,
that
I
necessarily
enjoyed
her
society
on
any
*NL*
terms
.
Only
--
when
I
had
had
her
with
me
in
her
de-feminine
capacity
for
*NL*
a
sixteen-hour
day
,
I
could
go
to
my
own
room
and
sleep
without
dreaming
*NL*
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
witch
!
If
ever
anybody
worked
to
woo
and
win
and
hold
a
human
soul
,
*NL*
she
did
,
great
superwoman
that
she
was
.
I
could
n't
then
half
comprehend
*NL*
the
skill
of
it
,
the
wonder
.
But
this
I
soon
began
to
find
:
that
under
*NL*
all
our
cultivated
attitude
of
mind
toward
women
,
there
is
an
older
,
*NL*
deeper
,
more
``
natural
''
feeling
,
the
restful
reverence
which
looks
up
to
*NL*
the
Mother
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
grew
together
in
friendship
and
happiness
,
Ellador
and
I
,
and
so
*NL*
did
Jeff
and
Celis
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
comes
to
Terry
's
part
of
it
,
and
Alima
's
,
I
'm
sorry
--
and
*NL*
I
'm
ashamed
.
Of
course
I
blame
her
somewhat
.
She
was
n't
as
fine
*NL*
a
psychologist
as
Ellador
,
and
what
's
more
,
I
think
she
had
a
*NL*
far-descended
atavistic
trace
of
more
marked
femaleness
,
never
apparent
*NL*
till
Terry
called
it
out
.
But
when
all
is
said
,
it
does
n't
excuse
him
.
I
*NL*
had
n't
realized
to
the
full
Terry
's
character
--
I
could
n't
,
being
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
position
was
the
same
as
with
us
,
of
course
,
only
with
these
*NL*
distinctions
.
Alima
,
a
shade
more
alluring
,
and
several
shades
less
able
*NL*
as
a
practical
psychologist
;
Terry
,
a
hundredfold
more
demanding
--
and
*NL*
proportionately
less
reasonable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
grew
strained
very
soon
between
them
.
I
fancy
at
first
,
when
*NL*
they
were
together
,
in
her
great
hope
of
parentage
and
his
keen
joy
of
*NL*
conquest
--
that
Terry
was
inconsiderate
.
In
fact
,
I
know
it
,
from
things
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
talk
to
me
,
''
he
snapped
at
Jeff
one
day
,
just
before
*NL*
our
weddings
.
``
There
never
was
a
woman
yet
that
did
not
enjoy
being
*NL*
MASTERED
.
All
your
pretty
talk
does
n't
amount
to
a
hill
o'beans
--
I
*NL*
KNOW
.
''
And
Terry
would
hum
:
*NL*
*NL*
I
've
taken
my
fun
where
I
found
it
.
*NL*
I
've
rogued
and
I
've
ranged
in
my
time
,
*NL*
*NL*
and
*NL*
*NL*
The
things
that
I
learned
from
the
yellow
and
black
,
*NL*
They
`
ave
helped
me
a
`
eap
with
the
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
turned
sharply
and
left
him
at
the
time
.
I
was
a
bit
disquieted
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
old
Terry
!
The
things
he
'd
learned
did
n't
help
him
a
heap
in
*NL*
Herland
.
His
idea
was
to
take
--
he
thought
that
was
the
way
.
He
thought
,
*NL*
he
honestly
believed
,
that
women
like
it
.
Not
the
women
of
Herland
!
Not
*NL*
Alima
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
see
her
now
--
one
day
in
the
very
first
week
of
their
marriage
,
*NL*
setting
forth
to
her
day
's
work
with
long
determined
strides
and
*NL*
hard-set
mouth
,
and
sticking
close
to
Ellador
.
She
did
n't
wish
to
be
*NL*
alone
with
Terry
--
you
could
see
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
more
she
kept
away
from
him
,
the
more
he
wanted
her
--
naturally
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
tremendous
row
about
their
separate
establishments
,
tried
to
*NL*
keep
her
in
his
rooms
,
tried
to
stay
in
hers
.
But
there
she
drew
the
*NL*
line
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
away
one
night
,
and
stamped
up
and
down
the
moonlit
road
,
*NL*
swearing
under
his
breath
.
I
was
taking
a
walk
that
night
too
,
but
I
*NL*
was
n't
in
his
state
of
mind
.
To
hear
him
rage
you
'd
not
have
believed
*NL*
that
he
loved
Alima
at
all
--
you
'd
have
thought
that
she
was
some
quarry
*NL*
he
was
pursuing
,
something
to
catch
and
conquer
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
that
,
owing
to
all
those
differences
I
spoke
of
,
they
soon
lost
*NL*
the
common
ground
they
had
at
first
,
and
were
unable
to
meet
sanely
*NL*
and
dispassionately
.
I
fancy
too
--
this
is
pure
conjecture
--
that
he
*NL*
had
succeeded
in
driving
Alima
beyond
her
best
judgment
,
her
real
*NL*
conscience
,
and
that
after
that
her
own
sense
of
shame
,
the
reaction
of
*NL*
the
thing
,
made
her
bitter
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
quarreled
,
really
quarreled
,
and
after
making
it
up
once
or
twice
,
*NL*
they
seemed
to
come
to
a
real
break
--
she
would
not
be
alone
with
him
*NL*
at
all
.
And
perhaps
she
was
a
bit
nervous
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
she
got
*NL*
Moadine
to
come
and
stay
next
door
to
her
.
Also
,
she
had
a
sturdy
*NL*
assistant
detailed
to
accompany
her
in
her
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
had
his
own
ideas
,
as
I
've
tried
to
show
.
I
daresay
he
thought
he
*NL*
had
a
right
to
do
as
he
did
.
Perhaps
he
even
convinced
himself
that
*NL*
it
would
be
better
for
her
.
Anyhow
,
he
hid
himself
in
her
bedroom
one
*NL*
night
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
of
Herland
have
no
fear
of
men
.
Why
should
they
have
?
They
*NL*
are
not
timid
in
any
sense
.
They
are
not
weak
;
and
they
all
have
strong
*NL*
trained
athletic
bodies
.
Othello
could
not
have
extinguished
Alima
with
*NL*
a
pillow
,
as
if
she
were
a
mouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
put
in
practice
his
pet
conviction
that
a
woman
loves
to
be
*NL*
mastered
,
and
by
sheer
brute
force
,
in
all
the
pride
and
passion
of
his
*NL*
intense
masculinity
,
he
tried
to
master
this
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
work
.
I
got
a
pretty
clear
account
of
it
later
from
Ellador
,
*NL*
but
what
we
heard
at
the
time
was
the
noise
of
a
tremendous
struggle
,
*NL*
and
Alima
calling
to
Moadine
.
Moadine
was
close
by
and
came
at
once
;
one
*NL*
or
two
more
strong
grave
women
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
dashed
about
like
a
madman
;
he
would
cheerfully
have
killed
*NL*
them
--
he
told
me
that
,
himself
--
but
he
could
n't
.
When
he
swung
a
chair
*NL*
over
his
head
one
sprang
in
the
air
and
caught
it
,
two
threw
themselves
*NL*
bodily
upon
him
and
forced
him
to
the
floor
;
it
was
only
the
work
of
a
*NL*
few
moments
to
have
him
tied
hand
and
foot
,
and
then
,
in
sheer
pity
for
*NL*
his
futile
rage
,
to
anesthetize
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alima
was
in
a
cold
fury
.
She
wanted
him
killed
--
actually
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
trial
before
the
local
Over
Mother
,
and
this
woman
,
who
did
*NL*
not
enjoy
being
mastered
,
stated
her
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
court
in
our
country
he
would
have
been
held
quite
``
within
his
*NL*
rights
,
''
of
course
.
But
this
was
not
our
country
;
it
was
theirs
.
They
*NL*
seemed
to
measure
the
enormity
of
the
offense
by
its
effect
upon
a
*NL*
possible
fatherhood
,
and
he
scorned
even
to
reply
to
this
way
of
putting
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
let
himself
go
once
,
and
explained
in
definite
terms
that
they
*NL*
were
incapable
of
understanding
a
man
's
needs
,
a
man
's
desires
,
a
man
's
*NL*
point
of
view
.
He
called
them
neuters
,
epicenes
,
bloodless
,
sexless
*NL*
creatures
.
He
said
they
could
of
course
kill
him
--
as
so
many
insects
*NL*
could
--
but
that
he
despised
them
nonetheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
those
stern
grave
mothers
did
not
seem
to
mind
his
despising
*NL*
them
,
not
in
the
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
trial
,
and
many
interesting
points
were
brought
out
as
to
*NL*
their
views
of
our
habits
,
and
after
a
while
Terry
had
his
sentence
.
He
*NL*
waited
,
grim
and
defiant
.
The
sentence
was
:
``
You
must
go
home
!
''

CHAPTER
12
.
Expelled
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
all
meant
to
go
home
again
.
Indeed
we
had
NOT
meant
--
not
by
any
*NL*
means
--
to
stay
as
long
as
we
had
.
But
when
it
came
to
being
turned
out
,
*NL*
dismissed
,
sent
away
for
bad
conduct
,
we
none
of
us
really
liked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
said
he
did
.
He
professed
great
scorn
of
the
penalty
and
the
*NL*
trial
,
as
well
as
all
the
other
characteristics
of
``
this
miserable
*NL*
half-country
.
''
But
he
knew
,
and
we
knew
,
that
in
any
``
whole
''
country
we
*NL*
should
never
have
been
as
forgivingly
treated
as
we
had
been
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
people
had
come
after
us
according
to
the
directions
we
left
,
*NL*
there
'd
have
been
quite
a
different
story
!
''
said
Terry
.
We
found
out
*NL*
later
why
no
reserve
party
had
arrived
.
All
our
careful
directions
had
*NL*
been
destroyed
in
a
fire
.
We
might
have
all
died
there
and
no
one
at
*NL*
home
have
ever
known
our
whereabouts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
under
guard
now
,
all
the
time
,
known
as
unsafe
,
convicted
of
*NL*
what
was
to
them
an
unpardonable
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
at
their
chill
horror
.
``
Parcel
of
old
maids
!
''
he
called
them
.
*NL*
``
They
're
all
old
maids
--
children
or
not
.
They
do
n't
know
the
first
thing
*NL*
about
Sex
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Terry
said
SEX
,
sex
with
a
very
large
_
S
_
,
he
meant
the
male
sex
,
*NL*
naturally
;
its
special
values
,
its
profound
conviction
of
being
``
the
*NL*
life
force
,
''
its
cheerful
ignoring
of
the
true
life
process
,
and
its
*NL*
interpretation
of
the
other
sex
solely
from
its
own
point
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
learned
to
see
these
things
very
differently
since
living
with
*NL*
Ellador
;
and
as
for
Jeff
,
he
was
so
thoroughly
Herlandized
that
he
*NL*
was
n't
fair
to
Terry
,
who
fretted
sharply
in
his
new
restraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moadine
,
grave
and
strong
,
as
sadly
patient
as
a
mother
with
a
*NL*
degenerate
child
,
kept
steady
watch
on
him
,
with
enough
other
women
*NL*
close
at
hand
to
prevent
an
outbreak
.
He
had
no
weapons
,
and
well
knew
*NL*
that
all
his
strength
was
of
small
avail
against
those
grim
,
quiet
*NL*
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
allowed
to
visit
him
freely
,
but
he
had
only
his
room
,
and
a
*NL*
small
high-walled
garden
to
walk
in
,
while
the
preparations
for
our
*NL*
departure
were
under
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
of
us
were
to
go
:
Terry
,
because
he
must
;
I
,
because
two
were
*NL*
safer
for
our
flyer
,
and
the
long
boat
trip
to
the
coast
;
Ellador
,
*NL*
because
she
would
not
let
me
go
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Jeff
had
elected
to
return
,
Celis
would
have
gone
too
--
they
were
the
*NL*
most
absorbed
of
lovers
;
but
Jeff
had
no
desire
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
want
to
go
back
to
all
our
noise
and
dirt
,
our
vice
and
*NL*
crime
,
our
disease
and
degeneracy
?
''
he
demanded
of
me
privately
.
We
*NL*
never
spoke
like
that
before
the
women
.
``
I
would
n't
take
Celis
there
for
*NL*
anything
on
earth
!
''
he
protested
.
``
She
'd
die
!
She
'd
die
of
horror
and
*NL*
shame
to
see
our
slums
and
hospitals
.
How
can
you
risk
it
with
Ellador
?
*NL*
You
'd
better
break
it
to
her
gently
before
she
really
makes
up
her
*NL*
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
was
right
.
I
ought
to
have
told
her
more
fully
than
I
did
,
of
all
*NL*
the
things
we
had
to
be
ashamed
of
.
But
it
is
very
hard
to
bridge
the
*NL*
gulf
of
as
deep
a
difference
as
existed
between
our
life
and
theirs
.
I
*NL*
tried
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
my
dear
,
''
I
said
to
her
.
``
If
you
are
really
going
to
my
*NL*
country
with
me
,
you
've
got
to
be
prepared
for
a
good
many
shocks
.
It
's
*NL*
not
as
beautiful
as
this
--
the
cities
,
I
mean
,
the
civilized
parts
--
of
*NL*
course
the
wild
country
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
enjoy
it
all
,
''
she
said
,
her
eyes
starry
with
hope
.
``
I
*NL*
understand
it
's
not
like
ours
.
I
can
see
how
monotonous
our
quiet
life
*NL*
must
seem
to
you
,
how
much
more
stirring
yours
must
be
.
It
must
be
*NL*
like
the
biological
change
you
told
me
about
when
the
second
sex
*NL*
was
introduced
--
a
far
greater
movement
,
constant
change
,
with
new
*NL*
possibilities
of
growth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
told
her
of
the
later
biological
theories
of
sex
,
and
she
*NL*
was
deeply
convinced
of
the
superior
advantages
of
having
two
,
the
*NL*
superiority
of
a
world
with
men
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
done
what
we
could
alone
;
perhaps
we
have
some
things
better
*NL*
in
a
quiet
way
,
but
you
have
the
whole
world
--
all
the
people
of
the
*NL*
different
nations
--
all
the
long
rich
history
behind
you
--
all
the
*NL*
wonderful
new
knowledge
.
Oh
,
I
just
ca
n't
wait
to
see
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
I
do
?
I
told
her
in
so
many
words
that
we
had
our
unsolved
*NL*
problems
,
that
we
had
dishonesty
and
corruption
,
vice
and
crime
,
disease
*NL*
and
insanity
,
prisons
and
hospitals
;
and
it
made
no
more
impression
on
*NL*
her
than
it
would
to
tell
a
South
Sea
Islander
about
the
temperature
of
*NL*
the
Arctic
Circle
.
She
could
intellectually
see
that
it
was
bad
to
have
*NL*
those
things
;
but
she
could
not
FEEL
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
quite
easily
come
to
accept
the
Herland
life
as
normal
,
because
*NL*
it
was
normal
--
none
of
us
make
any
outcry
over
mere
health
and
peace
*NL*
and
happy
industry
.
And
the
abnormal
,
to
which
we
are
all
so
sadly
well
*NL*
acclimated
,
she
had
never
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
things
she
cared
most
to
hear
about
,
and
wanted
most
to
see
,
*NL*
were
these
:
the
beautiful
relation
of
marriage
and
the
lovely
women
*NL*
who
were
mothers
and
nothing
else
;
beyond
these
her
keen
,
active
mind
*NL*
hungered
eagerly
for
the
world
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
almost
as
anxious
to
go
as
you
are
yourself
,
''
she
insisted
,
``
and
*NL*
you
must
be
desperately
homesick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
assured
her
that
no
one
could
be
homesick
in
such
a
paradise
as
*NL*
theirs
,
but
she
would
have
none
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
--
I
know
.
It
's
like
those
little
tropical
islands
you
've
told
me
*NL*
about
,
shining
like
jewels
in
the
big
blue
sea
--
I
ca
n't
wait
to
see
the
*NL*
sea
!
The
little
island
may
be
as
perfect
as
a
garden
,
but
you
always
*NL*
want
to
get
back
to
your
own
big
country
,
do
n't
you
?
Even
if
it
is
bad
*NL*
in
some
ways
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ellador
was
more
than
willing
.
But
the
nearer
it
came
to
our
really
*NL*
going
,
and
to
my
having
to
take
her
back
to
our
``
civilization
,
''
after
*NL*
the
clean
peace
and
beauty
of
theirs
,
the
more
I
began
to
dread
it
,
and
*NL*
the
more
I
tried
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
had
been
homesick
at
first
,
while
we
were
prisoners
,
before
*NL*
I
had
Ellador
.
And
of
course
I
had
,
at
first
,
rather
idealized
my
*NL*
country
and
its
ways
,
in
describing
it
.
Also
,
I
had
always
accepted
*NL*
certain
evils
as
integral
parts
of
our
civilization
and
never
dwelt
on
*NL*
them
at
all
.
Even
when
I
tried
to
tell
her
the
worst
,
I
never
remembered
*NL*
some
things
--
which
,
when
she
came
to
see
them
,
impressed
her
at
once
,
as
*NL*
they
had
never
impressed
me
.
Now
,
in
my
efforts
at
explanation
,
I
began
*NL*
to
see
both
ways
more
keenly
than
I
had
before
;
to
see
the
painful
*NL*
defects
of
my
own
land
,
the
marvelous
gains
of
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
missing
men
we
three
visitors
had
naturally
missed
the
larger
part
of
*NL*
life
,
and
had
unconsciously
assumed
that
they
must
miss
it
too
.
It
took
*NL*
me
a
long
time
to
realize
--
Terry
never
did
realize
--
how
little
it
*NL*
meant
to
them
.
When
we
say
MEN
,
MAN
,
MANLY
,
MANHOOD
,
and
all
the
other
*NL*
masculine
derivatives
,
we
have
in
the
background
of
our
minds
a
huge
*NL*
vague
crowded
picture
of
the
world
and
all
its
activities
.
To
grow
up
*NL*
and
``
be
a
man
,
''
to
``
act
like
a
man
''
--
the
meaning
and
connotation
is
*NL*
wide
indeed
.
That
vast
background
is
full
of
marching
columns
of
men
,
of
*NL*
changing
lines
of
men
,
of
long
processions
of
men
;
of
men
steering
*NL*
their
ships
into
new
seas
,
exploring
unknown
mountains
,
breaking
horses
,
*NL*
herding
cattle
,
ploughing
and
sowing
and
reaping
,
toiling
at
the
forge
*NL*
and
furnace
,
digging
in
the
mine
,
building
roads
and
bridges
and
high
*NL*
cathedrals
,
managing
great
businesses
,
teaching
in
all
the
colleges
,
*NL*
preaching
in
all
the
churches
;
of
men
everywhere
,
doing
everything
--
``
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
we
say
WOMEN
,
we
think
FEMALE
--
the
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
these
women
,
in
the
unbroken
sweep
of
this
two-thousand-year-old
*NL*
feminine
civilization
,
the
word
WOMAN
called
up
all
that
big
background
,
*NL*
so
far
as
they
had
gone
in
social
development
;
and
the
word
MAN
meant
to
*NL*
them
only
MALE
--
the
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
we
could
TELL
them
that
in
our
world
men
did
everything
;
but
*NL*
that
did
not
alter
the
background
of
their
minds
.
That
man
,
``
the
male
,
''
*NL*
did
all
these
things
was
to
them
a
statement
,
making
no
more
change
*NL*
in
the
point
of
view
than
was
made
in
ours
when
we
first
faced
the
*NL*
astounding
fact
--
to
us
--
that
in
Herland
women
were
``
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
been
living
there
more
than
a
year
.
We
had
learned
their
limited
*NL*
history
,
with
its
straight
,
smooth
,
upreaching
lines
,
reaching
higher
*NL*
and
going
faster
up
to
the
smooth
comfort
of
their
present
life
.
We
*NL*
had
learned
a
little
of
their
psychology
,
a
much
wider
field
than
the
*NL*
history
,
but
here
we
could
not
follow
so
readily
.
We
were
now
well
used
*NL*
to
seeing
women
not
as
females
but
as
people
;
people
of
all
sorts
,
doing
*NL*
every
kind
of
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
outbreak
of
Terry
's
,
and
the
strong
reaction
against
it
,
gave
us
*NL*
a
new
light
on
their
genuine
femininity
.
This
was
given
me
with
great
*NL*
clearness
by
both
Ellador
and
Somel
.
The
feeling
was
the
same
--
sick
*NL*
revulsion
and
horror
,
such
as
would
be
felt
at
some
climactic
blasphemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
no
faintest
approach
to
such
a
thing
in
their
minds
,
knowing
*NL*
nothing
of
the
custom
of
marital
indulgence
among
us
.
To
them
the
one
*NL*
high
purpose
of
motherhood
had
been
for
so
long
the
governing
law
of
*NL*
life
,
and
the
contribution
of
the
father
,
though
known
to
them
,
so
*NL*
distinctly
another
method
to
the
same
end
,
that
they
could
not
,
with
all
*NL*
their
effort
,
get
the
point
of
view
of
the
male
creature
whose
desires
*NL*
quite
ignore
parentage
and
seek
only
for
what
we
euphoniously
term
``
the
*NL*
joys
of
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
tried
to
tell
Ellador
that
women
too
felt
so
,
with
us
,
she
drew
*NL*
away
from
me
,
and
tried
hard
to
grasp
intellectually
what
she
could
in
*NL*
no
way
sympathize
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
--
that
with
you
--
love
between
man
and
woman
expresses
itself
in
*NL*
that
way
--
without
regard
to
motherhood
?
To
parentage
,
I
mean
,
''
she
added
*NL*
carefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
surely
.
It
is
love
we
think
of
--
the
deep
sweet
love
between
two
.
*NL*
Of
course
we
want
children
,
and
children
come
--
but
that
is
not
what
we
*NL*
think
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
but
--
it
seems
so
against
nature
!
''
she
said
.
``
None
of
the
creatures
*NL*
we
know
do
that
.
Do
other
animals
--
in
your
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
animals
!
''
I
replied
with
some
sharpness
.
``
At
least
we
*NL*
are
something
more
--
something
higher
.
This
is
a
far
nobler
and
more
*NL*
beautiful
relation
,
as
I
have
explained
before
.
Your
view
seems
to
us
*NL*
rather
--
shall
I
say
,
practical
?
Prosaic
?
Merely
a
means
to
an
end
!
With
*NL*
us
--
oh
,
my
dear
girl
--
can
not
you
see
?
Can
not
you
feel
?
It
is
the
last
,
*NL*
sweetest
,
highest
consummation
of
mutual
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
impressed
visibly
.
She
trembled
in
my
arms
,
as
I
held
her
close
,
*NL*
kissing
her
hungrily
.
But
there
rose
in
her
eyes
that
look
I
knew
so
*NL*
well
,
that
remote
clear
look
as
if
she
had
gone
far
away
even
though
*NL*
I
held
her
beautiful
body
so
close
,
and
was
now
on
some
snowy
mountain
*NL*
regarding
me
from
a
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
it
quite
clearly
,
''
she
said
to
me
.
``
It
gives
me
a
deep
sympathy
*NL*
with
what
you
feel
,
no
doubt
more
strongly
still
.
But
what
I
feel
,
even
*NL*
what
you
feel
,
dearest
,
does
not
convince
me
that
it
is
right
.
Until
I
*NL*
am
sure
of
that
,
of
course
I
can
not
do
as
you
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ellador
,
at
times
like
this
,
always
reminded
me
of
Epictetus
.
``
I
will
*NL*
put
you
in
prison
!
''
said
his
master
.
``
My
body
,
you
mean
,
''
replied
*NL*
Epictetus
calmly
.
``
I
will
cut
your
head
off
,
''
said
his
master
.
``
Have
I
*NL*
said
that
my
head
could
not
be
cut
off
?
''
A
difficult
person
,
Epictetus
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
this
miracle
by
which
a
woman
,
even
in
your
arms
,
may
withdraw
*NL*
herself
,
utterly
disappear
till
what
you
hold
is
as
inaccessible
as
the
*NL*
face
of
a
cliff
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
patient
with
me
,
dear
,
''
she
urged
sweetly
.
``
I
know
it
is
hard
for
*NL*
you
.
And
I
begin
to
see
--
a
little
--
how
Terry
was
so
driven
to
crime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
that
's
a
pretty
hard
word
for
it
.
After
all
,
Alima
was
*NL*
his
wife
,
you
know
,
''
I
urged
,
feeling
at
the
moment
a
sudden
burst
of
*NL*
sympathy
for
poor
Terry
.
For
a
man
of
his
temperament
--
and
habits
--
it
*NL*
must
have
been
an
unbearable
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Ellador
,
for
all
her
wide
intellectual
grasp
,
and
the
broad
sympathy
*NL*
in
which
their
religion
trained
them
,
could
not
make
allowance
for
*NL*
such
--
to
her
--
sacrilegious
brutality
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
more
difficult
to
explain
to
her
,
because
we
three
,
in
our
*NL*
constant
talks
and
lectures
about
the
rest
of
the
world
,
had
naturally
*NL*
avoided
the
seamy
side
;
not
so
much
from
a
desire
to
deceive
,
but
from
*NL*
wishing
to
put
the
best
foot
foremost
for
our
civilization
,
in
the
face
*NL*
of
the
beauty
and
comfort
of
theirs
.
Also
,
we
really
thought
some
things
*NL*
were
right
,
or
at
least
unavoidable
,
which
we
could
readily
see
would
be
*NL*
repugnant
to
them
,
and
therefore
did
not
discuss
.
Again
there
was
much
*NL*
of
our
world
's
life
which
we
,
being
used
to
it
,
had
not
noticed
as
*NL*
anything
worth
describing
.
And
still
further
,
there
was
about
these
*NL*
women
a
colossal
innocence
upon
which
many
of
the
things
we
did
say
had
*NL*
made
no
impression
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
thus
explicit
about
it
because
it
shows
how
unexpectedly
strong
*NL*
was
the
impression
made
upon
Ellador
when
she
at
last
entered
our
*NL*
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
urged
me
to
be
patient
,
and
I
was
patient
.
You
see
,
I
loved
her
so
*NL*
much
that
even
the
restrictions
she
so
firmly
established
left
me
much
*NL*
happiness
.
We
were
lovers
,
and
there
is
surely
delight
enough
in
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
not
imagine
that
these
young
women
utterly
refused
``
the
Great
New
*NL*
Hope
,
''
as
they
called
it
,
that
of
dual
parentage
.
For
that
they
had
*NL*
agreed
to
marry
us
,
though
the
marrying
part
of
it
was
a
concession
*NL*
to
our
prejudices
rather
than
theirs
.
To
them
the
process
was
the
holy
*NL*
thing
--
and
they
meant
to
keep
it
holy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
so
far
only
Celis
,
her
blue
eyes
swimming
in
happy
tears
,
her
*NL*
heart
lifted
with
that
tide
of
race-motherhood
which
was
their
supreme
*NL*
passion
,
could
with
ineffable
joy
and
pride
announce
that
she
was
to
*NL*
be
a
mother
.
``
The
New
Motherhood
''
they
called
it
,
and
the
whole
country
*NL*
knew
.
There
was
no
pleasure
,
no
service
,
no
honor
in
all
the
land
that
*NL*
Celis
might
not
have
had
.
Almost
like
the
breathless
reverence
with
*NL*
which
,
two
thousand
years
ago
,
that
dwindling
band
of
women
had
watched
*NL*
the
miracle
of
virgin
birth
,
was
the
deep
awe
and
warm
expectancy
with
*NL*
which
they
greeted
this
new
miracle
of
union
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
mothers
in
that
land
were
holy
.
To
them
,
for
long
ages
,
the
approach
*NL*
to
motherhood
has
been
by
the
most
intense
and
exquisite
love
and
*NL*
longing
,
by
the
Supreme
Desire
,
the
overmastering
demand
for
a
child
.
*NL*
Every
thought
they
held
in
connection
with
the
processes
of
maternity
*NL*
was
open
to
the
day
,
simple
yet
sacred
.
Every
woman
of
them
placed
*NL*
motherhood
not
only
higher
than
other
duties
,
but
so
far
higher
that
*NL*
there
were
no
other
duties
,
one
might
almost
say
.
All
their
wide
mutual
*NL*
love
,
all
the
subtle
interplay
of
mutual
friendship
and
service
,
*NL*
the
urge
of
progressive
thought
and
invention
,
the
deepest
religious
*NL*
emotion
,
every
feeling
and
every
act
was
related
to
this
great
central
*NL*
Power
,
to
the
River
of
Life
pouring
through
them
,
which
made
them
the
*NL*
bearers
of
the
very
Spirit
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
this
I
learned
more
and
more
--
from
their
books
,
from
talk
,
*NL*
especially
from
Ellador
.
She
was
at
first
,
for
a
brief
moment
,
envious
*NL*
of
her
friend
--
a
thought
she
put
away
from
her
at
once
and
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
better
,
''
she
said
to
me
.
``
It
is
much
better
that
it
has
not
come
*NL*
to
me
yet
--
to
us
,
that
is
.
For
if
I
am
to
go
with
you
to
your
country
,
*NL*
we
may
have
`
adventures
by
sea
and
land
,
'
as
you
say
-LSB-
and
as
in
truth
we
*NL*
did
-RSB-
,
and
it
might
not
be
at
all
safe
for
a
baby
.
So
we
wo
n't
try
again
,
*NL*
dear
,
till
it
is
safe
--
will
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
hard
saying
for
a
very
loving
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
if
one
is
coming
,
you
will
leave
me
behind
.
You
*NL*
can
come
back
,
you
know
--
and
I
shall
have
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
that
deep
ancient
chill
of
male
jealousy
of
even
his
own
progeny
*NL*
touched
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
have
you
,
Ellador
,
than
all
the
children
in
the
world
.
I
'd
*NL*
rather
have
you
with
me
--
on
your
own
terms
--
than
not
to
have
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
very
stupid
saying
.
Of
course
I
would
!
For
if
she
was
n't
*NL*
there
I
should
want
all
of
her
and
have
none
of
her
.
But
if
she
went
*NL*
along
as
a
sort
of
sublimated
sister
--
only
much
closer
and
warmer
than
*NL*
that
,
really
--
why
I
should
have
all
of
her
but
that
one
thing
.
And
I
*NL*
was
beginning
to
find
that
Ellador
's
friendship
,
Ellador
's
comradeship
,
*NL*
Ellador
's
sisterly
affection
,
Ellador
's
perfectly
sincere
love
--
none
*NL*
the
less
deep
that
she
held
it
back
on
a
definite
line
of
reserve
--
were
*NL*
enough
to
live
on
very
happily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
find
it
quite
beyond
me
to
describe
what
this
woman
was
to
me
.
We
talk
*NL*
fine
things
about
women
,
but
in
our
hearts
we
know
that
they
are
very
*NL*
limited
beings
--
most
of
them
.
We
honor
them
for
their
functional
powers
,
*NL*
even
while
we
dishonor
them
by
our
use
of
it
;
we
honor
them
for
their
*NL*
carefully
enforced
virtue
,
even
while
we
show
by
our
own
conduct
how
*NL*
little
we
think
of
that
virtue
;
we
value
them
,
sincerely
,
for
the
*NL*
perverted
maternal
activities
which
make
our
wives
the
most
comfortable
*NL*
of
servants
,
bound
to
us
for
life
with
the
wages
wholly
at
our
own
*NL*
decision
,
their
whole
business
,
outside
of
the
temporary
duties
of
such
*NL*
motherhood
as
they
may
achieve
,
to
meet
our
needs
in
every
way
.
Oh
,
we
*NL*
value
them
,
all
right
,
``
in
their
place
,
''
which
place
is
the
home
,
where
*NL*
they
perform
that
mixture
of
duties
so
ably
described
by
Mrs.
Josephine
*NL*
Dodge
Daskam
Bacon
,
in
which
the
services
of
``
a
mistress
''
are
carefully
*NL*
specified
.
She
is
a
very
clear
writer
,
Mrs.
J.
D.
D.
Bacon
,
and
*NL*
understands
her
subject
--
from
her
own
point
of
view
.
But
--
that
*NL*
combination
of
industries
,
while
convenient
,
and
in
a
way
economical
,
*NL*
does
not
arouse
the
kind
of
emotion
commanded
by
the
women
of
Herland
.
*NL*
These
were
women
one
had
to
love
``
up
,
''
very
high
up
,
instead
of
down
.
*NL*
They
were
not
pets
.
They
were
not
servants
.
They
were
not
timid
,
*NL*
inexperienced
,
weak
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
got
over
the
jar
to
my
pride
-LRB-
which
Jeff
,
I
truly
think
,
never
*NL*
felt
--
he
was
a
born
worshipper
,
and
which
Terry
never
got
over
--
he
*NL*
was
quite
clear
in
his
ideas
of
``
the
position
of
women
''
-RRB-
,
I
found
that
*NL*
loving
``
up
''
was
a
very
good
sensation
after
all
.
It
gave
me
a
queer
*NL*
feeling
,
way
down
deep
,
as
of
the
stirring
of
some
ancient
dim
*NL*
prehistoric
consciousness
,
a
feeling
that
they
were
right
somehow
--
that
*NL*
this
was
the
way
to
feel
.
It
was
like
--
coming
home
to
mother
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
mean
the
underflannels-and-doughnuts
mother
,
the
fussy
person
that
waits
*NL*
on
you
and
spoils
you
and
does
n't
really
know
you
.
I
mean
the
feeling
*NL*
that
a
very
little
child
would
have
,
who
had
been
lost
--
for
ever
so
*NL*
long
.
It
was
a
sense
of
getting
home
;
of
being
clean
and
rested
;
*NL*
of
safety
and
yet
freedom
;
of
love
that
was
always
there
,
warm
like
*NL*
sunshine
in
May
,
not
hot
like
a
stove
or
a
featherbed
--
a
love
that
*NL*
did
n't
irritate
and
did
n't
smother
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
Ellador
as
if
I
had
n't
seen
her
before
.
``
If
you
wo
n't
go
,
''
*NL*
I
said
,
``
I
'll
get
Terry
to
the
coast
and
come
back
alone
.
You
can
let
me
*NL*
down
a
rope
.
And
if
you
will
go
--
why
you
blessed
wonder-woman
--
I
would
*NL*
rather
live
with
you
all
my
life
--
like
this
--
than
to
have
any
other
*NL*
woman
I
ever
saw
,
or
any
number
of
them
,
to
do
as
I
like
with
.
Will
you
*NL*
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
keen
for
coming
.
So
the
plans
went
on
.
She
'd
have
liked
to
wait
*NL*
for
that
Marvel
of
Celis
's
,
but
Terry
had
no
such
desire
.
He
was
crazy
*NL*
to
be
out
of
it
all
.
It
made
him
sick
,
he
said
,
SICK
;
this
everlasting
*NL*
mother-mother-mothering
.
I
do
n't
think
Terry
had
what
the
phrenologists
*NL*
call
``
the
lump
of
philoprogenitiveness
''
at
all
well
developed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morbid
one-sided
cripples
,
''
he
called
them
,
even
when
from
his
window
*NL*
he
could
see
their
splendid
vigor
and
beauty
;
even
while
Moadine
,
as
*NL*
patient
and
friendly
as
if
she
had
never
helped
Alima
to
hold
and
bind
*NL*
him
,
sat
there
in
the
room
,
the
picture
of
wisdom
and
serene
strength
.
*NL*
``
Sexless
,
epicene
,
undeveloped
neuters
!
''
he
went
on
bitterly
.
He
sounded
*NL*
like
Sir
Almwroth
Wright
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
--
it
was
hard
.
He
was
madly
in
love
with
Alima
,
really
;
more
so
than
*NL*
he
had
ever
been
before
,
and
their
tempestuous
courtship
,
quarrels
,
and
*NL*
reconciliations
had
fanned
the
flame
.
And
then
when
he
sought
by
that
*NL*
supreme
conquest
which
seems
so
natural
a
thing
to
that
type
of
man
,
to
*NL*
force
her
to
love
him
as
her
master
--
to
have
the
sturdy
athletic
furious
*NL*
woman
rise
up
and
master
him
--
she
and
her
friends
--
it
was
no
wonder
he
*NL*
raged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Come
to
think
of
it
,
I
do
not
recall
a
similar
case
in
all
history
or
*NL*
fiction
.
Women
have
killed
themselves
rather
than
submit
to
outrage
;
*NL*
they
have
killed
the
outrager
;
they
have
escaped
;
or
they
have
*NL*
submitted
--
sometimes
seeming
to
get
on
very
well
with
the
victor
*NL*
afterward
.
There
was
that
adventure
of
``
false
Sextus
,
''
for
instance
,
*NL*
who
``
found
Lucrese
combing
the
fleece
,
under
the
midnight
lamp
.
''
He
*NL*
threatened
,
as
I
remember
,
that
if
she
did
not
submit
he
would
slay
her
,
*NL*
slay
a
slave
and
place
him
beside
her
and
say
he
found
him
there
.
A
poor
*NL*
device
,
it
always
seemed
to
me
.
If
Mr.
Lucretius
had
asked
him
how
he
*NL*
came
to
be
in
his
wife
's
bedroom
overlooking
her
morals
,
what
could
he
*NL*
have
said
?
But
the
point
is
Lucrese
submitted
,
and
Alima
did
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
kicked
me
,
''
confided
the
embittered
prisoner
--
he
had
to
talk
to
*NL*
someone
.
``
I
was
doubled
up
with
the
pain
,
of
course
,
and
she
jumped
on
*NL*
me
and
yelled
for
this
old
harpy
-LSB-
Moadine
could
n't
hear
him
-RSB-
and
they
*NL*
had
me
trussed
up
in
no
time
.
I
believe
Alima
could
have
done
it
alone
,
''
*NL*
he
added
with
reluctant
admiration
.
``
She
's
as
strong
as
a
horse
.
And
*NL*
of
course
a
man
's
helpless
when
you
hit
him
like
that
.
No
woman
with
a
*NL*
shade
of
decency
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
to
grin
at
that
,
and
even
Terry
did
,
sourly
.
He
was
n't
given
to
*NL*
reasoning
,
but
it
did
strike
him
that
an
assault
like
his
rather
waived
*NL*
considerations
of
decency
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
give
a
year
of
my
life
to
have
her
alone
again
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
*NL*
his
hands
clenched
till
the
knuckles
were
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
never
did
.
She
left
our
end
of
the
country
entirely
,
went
up
into
*NL*
the
fir-forest
on
the
highest
slopes
,
and
stayed
there
.
Before
we
left
*NL*
he
quite
desperately
longed
to
see
her
,
but
she
would
not
come
and
he
*NL*
could
not
go
.
They
watched
him
like
lynxes
.
-LRB-
Do
lynxes
watch
any
better
*NL*
than
mousing
cats
,
I
wonder
!
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Well
--
we
had
to
get
the
flyer
in
order
,
and
be
sure
there
was
enough
*NL*
fuel
left
,
though
Terry
said
we
could
glide
all
right
,
down
to
that
*NL*
lake
,
once
we
got
started
.
We
'd
have
gone
gladly
in
a
week
's
time
,
of
*NL*
course
,
but
there
was
a
great
to-do
all
over
the
country
about
*NL*
Ellador
's
leaving
them
.
She
had
interviews
with
some
of
the
leading
*NL*
ethicists
--
wise
women
with
still
eyes
,
and
with
the
best
of
the
*NL*
teachers
.
There
was
a
stir
,
a
thrill
,
a
deep
excitement
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
teaching
about
the
rest
of
the
world
has
given
them
all
a
sense
*NL*
of
isolation
,
of
remoteness
,
of
being
a
little
outlying
sample
of
a
*NL*
country
,
overlooked
and
forgotten
among
the
family
of
nations
.
We
had
*NL*
called
it
``
the
family
of
nations
,
''
and
they
liked
the
phrase
immensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
deeply
aroused
on
the
subject
of
evolution
;
indeed
,
the
whole
*NL*
field
of
natural
science
drew
them
irresistibly
.
Any
number
of
them
*NL*
would
have
risked
everything
to
go
to
the
strange
unknown
lands
and
*NL*
study
;
but
we
could
take
only
one
,
and
it
had
to
be
Ellador
,
naturally
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
planned
greatly
about
coming
back
,
about
establishing
a
connecting
*NL*
route
by
water
;
about
penetrating
those
vast
forests
and
civilizing
--
or
*NL*
exterminating
--
the
dangerous
savages
.
That
is
,
we
men
talked
of
that
*NL*
last
--
not
with
the
women
.
They
had
a
definite
aversion
to
killing
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
meanwhile
there
was
high
council
being
held
among
the
wisest
of
them
*NL*
all
.
The
students
and
thinkers
who
had
been
gathering
facts
from
us
all
*NL*
this
time
,
collating
and
relating
them
,
and
making
inferences
,
laid
the
*NL*
result
of
their
labors
before
the
council
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
had
we
thought
that
our
careful
efforts
at
concealment
had
been
*NL*
so
easily
seen
through
,
with
never
a
word
to
show
us
that
they
saw
.
They
*NL*
had
followed
up
words
of
ours
on
the
science
of
optics
,
asked
innocent
*NL*
questions
about
glasses
and
the
like
,
and
were
aware
of
the
defective
*NL*
eyesight
so
common
among
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
lightest
touch
,
different
women
asking
different
questions
at
*NL*
different
times
,
and
putting
all
our
answers
together
like
a
picture
*NL*
puzzle
,
they
had
figured
out
a
sort
of
skeleton
chart
as
to
the
*NL*
prevalence
of
disease
among
us
.
Even
more
subtly
with
no
show
of
horror
*NL*
or
condemnation
,
they
had
gathered
something
--
far
from
the
truth
,
but
*NL*
something
pretty
clear
--
about
poverty
,
vice
,
and
crime
.
They
even
had
*NL*
a
goodly
number
of
our
dangers
all
itemized
,
from
asking
us
about
*NL*
insurance
and
innocent
things
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
well
posted
as
to
the
different
races
,
beginning
with
their
*NL*
poison-arrow
natives
down
below
and
widening
out
to
the
broad
racial
*NL*
divisions
we
had
told
them
about
.
Never
a
shocked
expression
of
the
face
*NL*
or
exclamation
of
revolt
had
warned
us
;
they
had
been
extracting
the
*NL*
evidence
without
our
knowing
it
all
this
time
,
and
now
were
studying
*NL*
with
the
most
devout
earnestness
the
matter
they
had
prepared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
was
rather
distressing
to
us
.
They
first
explained
the
matter
*NL*
fully
to
Ellador
,
as
she
was
the
one
who
purposed
visiting
the
Rest
*NL*
of
the
World
.
To
Celis
they
said
nothing
.
She
must
not
be
in
any
way
*NL*
distressed
,
while
the
whole
nation
waited
on
her
Great
Work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
Jeff
and
I
were
called
in
.
Somel
and
Zava
were
there
,
and
*NL*
Ellador
,
with
many
others
that
we
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
great
globe
,
quite
fairly
mapped
out
from
the
small
section
*NL*
maps
in
that
compendium
of
ours
.
They
had
the
different
peoples
of
the
*NL*
earth
roughly
outlined
,
and
their
status
in
civilization
indicated
.
*NL*
They
had
charts
and
figures
and
estimates
,
based
on
the
facts
in
that
*NL*
traitorous
little
book
and
what
they
had
learned
from
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somel
explained
:
``
We
find
that
in
all
your
historic
period
,
so
much
*NL*
longer
than
ours
,
that
with
all
the
interplay
of
services
,
the
exchange
*NL*
of
inventions
and
discoveries
,
and
the
wonderful
progress
we
so
admire
,
*NL*
that
in
this
widespread
Other
World
of
yours
,
there
is
still
much
*NL*
disease
,
often
contagious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
admitted
this
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Also
there
is
still
,
in
varying
degree
,
ignorance
,
with
prejudice
and
*NL*
unbridled
emotion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
too
was
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
find
also
that
in
spite
of
the
advance
of
democracy
and
the
increase
*NL*
of
wealth
,
that
there
is
still
unrest
and
sometimes
combat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
yes
,
we
admitted
it
all
.
We
were
used
to
these
things
and
saw
no
*NL*
reason
for
so
much
seriousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
things
considered
,
''
they
said
,
and
they
did
not
say
a
hundredth
*NL*
part
of
the
things
they
were
considering
,
``
we
are
unwilling
to
expose
*NL*
our
country
to
free
communication
with
the
rest
of
the
world
--
as
yet
.
If
*NL*
Ellador
comes
back
,
and
we
approve
her
report
,
it
may
be
done
later
--
but
*NL*
not
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
have
this
to
ask
of
you
gentlemen
-LSB-
they
knew
that
word
was
held
*NL*
a
title
of
honor
with
us
-RSB-
,
that
you
promise
not
in
any
way
to
betray
the
*NL*
location
of
this
country
until
permission
--
after
Ellador
's
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jeff
was
perfectly
satisfied
.
He
thought
they
were
quite
right
.
He
*NL*
always
did
.
I
never
saw
an
alien
become
naturalized
more
quickly
than
*NL*
that
man
in
Herland
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
studied
it
awhile
,
thinking
of
the
time
they
'd
have
if
some
of
our
*NL*
contagions
got
loose
there
,
and
concluded
they
were
right
.
So
I
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
was
the
obstacle
.
``
Indeed
I
wo
n't
!
''
he
protested
.
``
The
first
*NL*
thing
I
'll
do
is
to
get
an
expedition
fixed
up
to
force
an
entrance
into
*NL*
Ma-land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
they
said
quite
calmly
,
``
he
must
remain
an
absolute
prisoner
,
*NL*
always
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anesthesia
would
be
kinder
,
''
urged
Moadine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
safer
,
''
added
Zava
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
promise
,
I
think
,
''
said
Ellador
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
did
.
With
which
agreement
we
at
last
left
Herland
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
